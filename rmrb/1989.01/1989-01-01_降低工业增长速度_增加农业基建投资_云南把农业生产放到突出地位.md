Yunnan prioritizes agriculture by reducing industrial growth and increasing agricultural investment

Xinhua News Agency, Kunming - In arranging the 1989 national economic and social development plan, Yunnan Province has placed agriculture in a prominent position.

Yunnan Governor He Zhiquang recently stated at a planning meeting: "We must thoroughly change the situation where agricultural issues are neglected in planning work and genuinely prioritize agricultural issues in planning."

Yunnan's total fixed asset investment for 1989 has been reduced by 43.4% compared to last year, with state-owned enterprise fixed asset investment decreased by 44.6%. The industrial production growth rate has been lowered from over 15.4% this year to 9.5%. However, agricultural investment has increased by 13% compared to last year. Among these, the province's budgeted agricultural infrastructure investment has increased by 36.9%. The provincial budget for agriculture has also increased by 20 million yuan, and agricultural technology renovation funds have increased by another 20 million yuan. Local governments below the provincial level have also increased their agricultural investments. Starting this year, the provincial government has decided to collect appropriate technical improvement fees for tobacco, tea, and sugarcane, which will be used to support grain production. A portion of the public accumulation funds from rural cooperative economic organizations will also be invested in local agricultural construction.

This year, the supply of agricultural materials has been prioritized. Fertilizer supply will increase by 200,000 tons compared to last year, with pesticide and plastic film supplies increasing by 120 tons and 2,000 tons, respectively. Yunnan Province has also allocated $22.3 million in foreign exchange to import fertilizers, pesticides, and plastic film materials.

　　降低工业增长速度　增加农业基建投资
    云南把农业生产放到突出地位
    新华社昆明电  （记者刘远达）云南省在安排１９８９年国民经济和社会发展计划时，把农业放到了突出的地位。
    云南省省长和志强在最近召开的计划会议上指出：“要彻底改变计划工作上忽视农业的状况，切实把农业问题放在计划工作的首位来安排。”
    云南省１９８９年的固定资产总投资比去年压缩４３．４％，其中全民所有制单位固定资产投资比去年减少４４．６％。工业生产增长速度由今年增长１５．４％以上，降为增长９．５％。而农业总投资却比去年增加１３％。其中省预算内农业基本建设投资比去年增加３６．９％。省财政预算内用于农业的资金还增加了２０００万元，农业技术改造资金也增加了２０００万元。省以下地方财政也增加了农业投入。从今年开始，省政府决定对烤烟、茶叶、甘蔗等经济作物收取适当的技术改进费，用于扶持粮食生产。各地农村合作经济组织的公积金，也将提取一部分投入当地农业建设。
    今年农用物资供应得到优先安排。化肥供应将比去年增加２０万吨，农药和农膜供应分别增加１２０吨和２０００吨。云南省还安排了２２３０万美元外汇进口化肥、农药和农膜原料。
