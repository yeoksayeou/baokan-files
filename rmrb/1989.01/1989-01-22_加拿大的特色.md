The characteristics of Canada are what?

This is a very sensitive question. In the three-year-long debate over the Canada-U.S. Free Trade Agreement, the core issue has been the protection of Canada's sovereignty and "characteristics." Those who oppose the free trade agreement believe that engaging in free trade with the United States, a country with ten times Canada's economic strength and population, will inevitably lead to Canada being economically dominated by the United States, its culture being overwhelmed by American influence, and ultimately losing its national sovereignty and distinctive national characteristics. Supporters of free trade, however, argue that these concerns are unfounded, reasoning that Canada has always had a good relationship with the United States, with approximately 200 various agreements and treaties between the two countries, and that 80% of trade is already free trade. Despite the increasing closeness of the two countries' relations, they argue, Canada's distinctive characteristics will not gradually diminish.

Last month, on the 22nd, Canadian Prime Minister Mulroney gave a summary of the similarities and differences between Canada and the United States during a parliamentary debate on the Canada-U.S. Free Trade Agreement. He said: Canadians and Americans have lived harmoniously together for over two centuries. We agree on many things and pursue many of the same goals. We share a continent and a love for freedom, but in many ways, we have profound differences: Canada practices a constitutional monarchy, while the United States is a republic; Canada has a unique legal system derived from the British House of Commons and French civil law, and Canada's official languages are English and French. We also follow a policy of multiculturalism. Although Canada is a loyal ally of the United States and belongs to NATO and the North American Aerospace Defense Command, our views on the world are not always the same.

A Canadian journalist, when discussing the main differences between Canada and the United States, said that the United States was established through a revolution that overthrew British rule, so Americans have a spirit of "revolution and innovation." Canada, on the other hand, evolved from the British system and still honors the British monarch, so Canadians tend to be more conservative in their thinking.

Almost everyone who moves from the United States to Canada has a common experience: the two countries are significantly different. This is first evident in the fact that American society is full of competition and vitality, while Canadian society is relatively stable. Canada's welfare system is superior to that of the United States, and the gap between the rich and the poor is not as pronounced. Secondly, Americans are more open and friendly, while Canadians are more reserved and polite, making them less approachable. Thirdly, although both the United States and Canada are immigrant countries, the racial relations in American society are not as relaxed as in Canada. This is also one of the important reasons why many immigrants choose Canada as their permanent residence.

Coming from the United States to Canada, many people feel as if they have gone from a bustling city to a tranquil countryside. Although Canadians also feel the seriousness of environmental problems, the pastoral scenery and natural beauty here are still rare in the world. Therefore, many people say that they are willing to go to the United States to make money and come to Canada to retire.

Canada is a country that is both large and small. It is large in the sense that it has a territory of over 9.9 million square kilometers, making it the second-largest country in the world after the Soviet Union. It is small in the sense that only 25 million people live on this vast land. However, the wealth created by these 25 million people allows Canada to rank among the seven major industrialized countries in the West.

As a major industrialized country, Canada shares many common points with Western major powers in coordinating economic policies. However, Canada is also a major exporter of raw materials, so it shares many common points with many Third World countries in this regard. This dual characteristic gives Canada a broad voice in some international organizations.

Since the end of World War II, due to the increase in American power, Canada has been influenced by American forces. The United States and Canada are the world's largest trading partners. American capital holds an absolute leading position in Canadian foreign investment. Despite the increasing closeness of the two countries' economic relations, Canada still has strict restrictions on the United States in areas such as film and publishing. This is also one of the main issues of contention in the Canada-U.S. Free Trade negotiations, with the core being that Canada wants to limit American cultural influence and maintain its own cultural characteristics.

Canada is a unique country in the world. It is a member of the Commonwealth and an important member of the Francophone Summit. It is an ally and friendly country with Western countries, and it also has broad friendly relations with Eastern countries. This international status makes Canada almost participate in all the peacekeeping operations of the United Nations. In addition, Canada's position on some international issues is also relatively special among Western countries. For example, on the issue of sanctions against South Africa, Canada's attitude is the most active among the major Western countries. In the territorial dispute between Britain and Argentina over the Malvinas Islands, Canada advocated that Britain should negotiate with Argentina to resolve the issue. This stance made the British angry and displeased the Americans.

All of this constitutes the characteristics of Canada. When summarizing these characteristics, people often say that Canada is one country, two official languages, three major political parties, and accommodates multiculturalism. These statements seem to make sense but are not entirely accurate. The simplest summary is still a phrase that Canadians often say: Canadians are Canadians, neither Americans, nor British, nor French.

### 加拿大的特色

　　加拿大的特色
    郭文福
    加拿大的特色是什么呢？
    这是一个很敏感的问题。在历时三年多有关加美自由贸易问题的大辩论中，其核心问题就是维护加拿大的主权和“特色”的问题。反对自由贸易协定的人认为，同经济实力和人口都是自己１０倍的美国进行自由贸易，其后果必然是使加拿大在经济上受制于美国，文化被美国的势力所淹没，最终将丧失国家主权，冲掉民族特色。支持自由贸易的人则反驳说，这种担心是没有根据的，理由是：加拿大一直同美国相处很好，两国之间有大约２００多项各类协定和条约，而且８０％的贸易已是自由贸易，尽管两国的关系日益密切，但加拿大人的特色并不会因此而逐步减退。
    加拿大总理马尔罗尼上个月２２日在联邦议会辩论加美自由贸易协定时就加美两国的共同点和不同点作了这样一番概述：加拿大人同美国人已和谐相处两个多世纪，我们在许多事情上一致，追求许多相同的目标，共居一个大陆，分享对自由的爱，但我们在许多方面又有着深刻的区别：加拿大实行君主立宪制，美国则是共和制；加拿大有着从英国的下院制和法国的民法继承来的独特的法律制度，加拿大的官方语言是英法两种语言，还奉行多元文化政策；尽管加拿大是美国的忠实盟友，同属北约和北美空防联合司令部，但两国对世界的看法并不总是相同。
    一位加拿大记者在谈到加美两国的主要区别时这样说，美国是通过革命推翻英国人的统治而建国的，因此，美国人富有一种“革命和创新精神”，而加拿大是一个从英国制度下演变而来的国家，至今尊崇英国女王，因此加拿大人的思想比较保守。
    几乎所有从美国移居加拿大的人都有一个共同的体会，即美加两国有着显著的不同。这首先表现在美国的社会充满竞争和活力，而加拿大的社会则显得比较平稳，加拿大的福利制度优于美国，国民贫富之差没有美国那么明显。其次，美国人好客开朗，而加拿大人则有些拘谨，彬彬有礼，不容易接近。第三，美国和加拿大虽都是移民国家，但美国社会里的种族关系却没有加拿大轻松，这也是许多移民愿意选择加拿大为永久居住地的重要原因之一。
    从美国来到加拿大，许多人感觉犹如从繁华的都市来到恬静的乡村。虽然加拿大人也感到环境问题的严重，但这里的田园风光和大自然美在世界上仍是不可多得的。因此，许多人说，他们愿意到美国去挣钱，到加拿大来养老。
    加拿大是一个又大又小的国家。说其大是指它拥有９９０多万平方公里的领土，在世界上仅次于苏联居第二位。说其小是指在这么广阔的土地上只居住着２５００多万人口。而这２５００多万人创造的财富却使加拿大能跻身于西方七个主要工业国之列。
    作为一个主要的工业发达国家，加拿大同西方主要大国在协调经济政策方面有着许多共同点。但加拿大又是主要原材料出口国，因此它同许多第三世界国家在这方面又有不少共同点。这种双重特点决定了加拿大在一些国际组织中有着广泛的发言权。
    战后由于美国实力大增，加拿大受到美国势力的影响。加美两国是世界上最大的一对贸易伙伴。美国资本在加拿大外资中占有绝对领先的地位。尽管两国的经济关系日益密切，但加拿大在包括电影，出版等文化业方面对美国的限制仍很严格。这也是加美自由贸易谈判中争论激烈的主要问题之一，其核心在于加拿大要限制美国文化的影响，保持加拿大自己的文化特色。
    加拿大是世界上这样一个独一无二的国家，它既是英联邦的一员，又是法语国家首脑会议的重要成员。既同西方国家是盟国，友好国家，又同东方国家有着广泛的友好关系。这样一种国际地位，使加拿大几乎参加了联合国维持和平部队的所有行动。此外，在一些国际问题上加拿大的立场在西方国家中也比较特殊。如对制裁南非问题，西方主要国家中加拿大的态度最为积极。在英国和阿根廷马尔维纳斯群岛领土争端中，加拿大主张英国应同阿谈判解决问题，这一主张使英国人恼火，令美国人不悦。
    这一切都构成了加拿大的特色。在总结这些特色时有人常说，加拿大是一个国家、两种官方语言，三个主要政党，容纳多元文化。这些话似乎有道理，但还不完全。最简单的总结还是加拿大人自己常说的一句话：加拿大人就是加拿大人，既不是美国人，也不是英国人，也不是法国人。
