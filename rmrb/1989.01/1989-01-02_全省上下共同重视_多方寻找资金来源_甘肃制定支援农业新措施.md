The entire province is jointly focusing on finding funding sources. Gansu Province implements new measures to support agriculture.

People's Daily reports: Gansu Province Party Secretary Li Zichi recently emphasized that Gansu's grain production has not yet been secured. It is necessary to increase investment in funds and materials based on the actual conditions of poor agricultural foundations and insufficient investment. The goal is to strive for another leap in grain production.

Last year, Gansu's total grain output reached 5.75 billion kilograms, an increase of 500 million kilograms compared to the previous year. Based on the stable production of 5.25 billion kilograms over the past five years, it has reached a new level. The total agricultural output value reached 5 billion yuan, setting a historical high. Economic crops generally completed their annual plans; sugar beets, fruits, and other crops have exceeded the "Seventh Five-Year Plan" targets. The commercial rate of agricultural products reached 40%. The province has already lifted more than 6.5 million people out of poverty, and the proportion of poor households has decreased from 34% in 1986 to 20.61%.

However, Li Zichi believes that Gansu's grain production foundation is weak, and the grain problem has not been resolved. Each year, about 500 million kilograms of grain need to be imported to solve the food problem for more than 3 million people. Therefore, the province has decided that starting from 1989, 1% of the total extra-budgetary funds in the province will be allocated as an agricultural development fund; 80% of the increased tax revenue from township enterprises will be used for agriculture; a technical improvement fee will be extracted from the grain operation link and used for grain technology promotion; the provincial share of the land use tax and land occupation fee already levied will all be used for agricultural construction; strengthen the collection of agricultural forestry water special tax and individual and private enterprise taxes in rural areas, with 80% of the collected taxes used for agricultural construction, focusing on supporting grain production. Through these channels, in addition to financial and credit funds, the province aims to raise 60 million yuan annually for agricultural development.

To increase the input of fertilizers and plastic film, the Provincial Planning Commission will take the lead to accelerate the construction and production of the 1.2 million-ton phosphorus diammonium phosphate project in Jinchang and the phosphorus ammonium phosphate project in Baiyin. Actively seek to expand and renovate existing fertilizer enterprises to increase production. Appropriately raise the standards for linking high-quality fertilizers with contracted grain purchases.

　　全省上下共同重视　多方寻找资金来源
    甘肃制定支援农业新措施
    本报讯  甘肃省委书记李子奇最近强调，甘肃粮食生产还没有过关，必须针对农业基础条件差，投入少的实际，增加资金和物质投入，争取粮食生产再上一个新台阶。　　
    去年，甘肃粮食总产量达到５７．５亿公斤，比上年净增５亿公斤。在连续５年稳定在５２．５亿公斤的基础上，又跨上了新的台阶；农业总产值达５０亿元，创历史最高水平。经济作物普遍完成了年计划；甜菜、瓜果等已超过“七五”规划指标。农产品商品率达４０％。全省已有６５０多万人口脱贫，贫困户占总农户的比重已由１９８６年的３４％下降到２０．６１％。　　
    但李子奇认为，甘肃粮食生产基础薄弱，粮食问题仍然没有过关。每年调进５亿公斤左右的粮食方能解决３００多万人的温饱问题。为此，省里决定，从１９８９年开始，从全省预算外总资金中提出１％作为农业发展基金；乡镇企业税收增加部分的８０％用于农业；从粮食经营环节提取技术改进费，用于粮食技术推广；已经开征的耕地占用税和收取的土地占用费的留省部分，全部用于农业建设；强化农林水特产税和农村个体工商户、私营企业税收的征收工作，所征税金的８０％用于农业建设，重点是扶持粮食生产。通过以上几种渠道，除财政和信贷资金外，全省争取每年筹集到农业发展基金６０００万元。　　
    为了增加化肥、地膜的投入量，由省计委牵头，尽快使金昌１２万吨磷二铵、白银磷一铵项目建设投产。积极争取扩建改造现有化肥企业，增加产量。适当提高平价优质化肥同定购粮挂钩的标准。
