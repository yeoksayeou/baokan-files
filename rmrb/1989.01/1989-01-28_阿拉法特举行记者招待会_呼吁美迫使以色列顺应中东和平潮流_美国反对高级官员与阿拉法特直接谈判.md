Arafat Holds Press Conference
Urges U.S. to Pressure Israel to Follow Middle East Peace Trend
U.S. Opposes High-Level Officials Directly Negotiating with Arafat

MUSCAT, Jan. 26 (Xinhua) — The Chairman of the Executive Committee of the Palestine Liberation Organization (PLO), Yasser Arafat, held a press conference in Muscat, the capital of Oman, on January 25. He urged U.S. President George H.W. Bush to take immediate action to force Israel to follow the call for peace in the Middle East.

Arafat said that the key now is the United States, not Israel.

He also called for Israel to immediately withdraw from the occupied Arab territories and end its massacre of Palestinian rebels.

Arafat concluded his three-day visit to Oman on January 25.

WASHINGTON, Jan. 26 (Xinhua) — White House spokesman Marlin Fitzwater said today that the United States opposes its high-level officials holding direct talks with PLO Chairman Yasser Arafat.

He said that it is still too early for President Bush and Secretary of State James Baker to hold talks with Arafat.

An aide to Arafat had said that unless Baker or Bush met with Arafat, he would abandon his application for a U.S. visa to attend the annual meeting of the American-Arab Anti-Discrimination Committee in Washington on April 13. The committee announced on January 16 that Arafat had "formally accepted" the invitation to speak at the annual meeting.

The United States had previously refused to negotiate with the PLO and had denied Arafat a visa on grounds of terrorism, preventing him from speaking at the United Nations. It was only after Arafat announced in December that the PLO condemned terrorism and recognized Israel's right to exist that direct talks between the U.S. and the PLO in Tunis became possible.

Regarding whether the scope of U.S.-PLO contacts could be upgraded, Fitzwater said, "We will watch the actions taken by the PLO in fulfilling its promises," and "We will make corresponding judgments, but it is too early to talk about (direct) talks now."

　　阿拉法特举行记者招待会    
    呼吁美迫使以色列顺应中东和平潮流    
    美国反对高级官员与阿拉法特直接谈判
    新华社科威特１月２６日电  马斯喀特消息，巴勒斯坦解放组织执委会主席阿拉法特２５日在阿曼首都马斯喀特举行记者招待会，呼吁美国总统布什迅速采取行动，迫使以色列顺应中东和平的呼声。
    阿拉法特说，现在的关键是美国，而不是以色列。
    他还呼吁以色列立即撤出被占阿拉伯领土，结束它对巴勒斯坦起义者的屠杀。
    阿拉法特２５日结束了对阿曼进行的３天访问。
    新华社华盛顿１月２６日电　白宫发言人菲茨沃特今天说，美国反对其高级官员与巴勒斯坦解放组织主席阿拉法特举行直接谈判。
    他说，美国总统布什和国务卿贝克与阿拉法特举行会谈还为时尚早。
    阿拉法特的一位助手曾说，除非贝克或布什与阿拉法特会谈，他将放弃申请赴美签证、参加美国阿拉伯人反种族歧视委员会４月１３日在华盛顿举行的年会。该委员会本月１６日宣布，阿拉法特已“正式接受”在年会上发表讲话的邀请。
    美国过去一直拒绝与巴解举行谈判，并曾以恐怖主义为由拒绝给阿拉法特发放签证，使其未能赴联大进行演讲。直到去年１２月阿拉法特宣布巴解谴责恐怖主义、承认以色列的生存权利，才给美巴在突尼斯的直接谈判铺平道路。
    在谈到美巴接触规模能否升级时，菲茨沃特说，“我们将注视巴解在履行其诺言时所采取的行动”，“我们将作出相应的判断，但此时谈论（美巴直接）会谈为时尚早。”
