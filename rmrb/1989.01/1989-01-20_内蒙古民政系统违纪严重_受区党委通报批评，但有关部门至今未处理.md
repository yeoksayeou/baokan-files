The People's Daily reports from Hohhot: Recently, the auditing department of Inner Mongolia revealed that the civil affairs system in Inner Mongolia has seriously violated financial discipline. They arbitrarily occupy, misappropriate, and waste civil affairs funds, misappropriate disaster relief funds and social welfare funds, and even misuse donations from the public and condolence money for the families of soldiers who fought in the Old Mountain Front, reaching an intolerable level. The amount of money involved in violations in just 1986 and 1987 alone reached 10.28 million yuan. Their violations mainly manifest in the following ways:

1. Occupying and misappropriating civil affairs funds for organizational, personnel expenses, and equipment purchases. For example, the Civil Affairs Bureau of Xingan League used 1,030 yuan from the condolence money for the families of soldiers who fought in the Old Mountain Front to buy a camera.

2. Misappropriating civil affairs funds to build houses for departmental staff. For example, the head of the Civil Affairs Bureau of Mangui County in Bayannur League used maintenance funds for the crematorium to build a house for himself that exceeds the standard.

3. Occupying and misappropriating civil affairs funds to purchase vehicles. The entire region misappropriated 1.52 million yuan in civil affairs funds to purchase 59 vehicles.

4. Misappropriating civil affairs funds for commercial and business activities. The Civil Affairs Bureau of Baotou City used 120,000 yuan in special funds for supporting social welfare production allocated by the Autonomous Region Civil Affairs Department, which was given to the bureau's labor service company for commercial use without compensation. Similar situations occurred in the Civil Affairs Bureau of Xilingol League and Mangui County.

5. Using civil affairs funds for banquets, gifts, and excessive distribution of goods and subsidies. The Civil Affairs Bureau of Mangui County in Bayannur League spent 19,280 yuan in social relief and welfare funds on banquets and receptions in two years, including 48 banquets from July to September 1987.

Last November, the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region Party Committee issued a notice criticizing the civil affairs department for violating financial discipline, but the relevant departments have not yet taken any action to address the issue.

　　内蒙古民政系统违纪严重
    受区党委通报批评，但有关部门至今未处理
    本报呼和浩特讯  记者傲腾报道：记者最近从内蒙古审计部门获悉：内蒙古民政系统违犯财经纪律情况十分严重。他们随意挤占挪用、挥霍浪费民政事业费，滥花救灾款和社会福利费，甚至把群众捐献的救济款和老山前线参战人员的家属慰问费乱支乱花，已经到了不能容忍的地步。仅１９８６、１９８７两年违纪金额就达１０２８万元。他们的违纪主要表现在：
    一，挤占挪用民政事业用于机构、人员经费和设备购置。例如兴安盟民政处用老山前线参战人员家属慰问费１０３０元买了照像机。
    二，挪用民政事业费为本部门职工建造房舍。例如，巴彦淖尔盟磴口县民政局长用火葬场维修费给自己盖了超标准的宿舍。
    三，挤占挪用民政事业费购置车辆。全区共挪用民政事业费１５２万元，购车５９辆。
    四，挪用民政事业费经商办企业。包头市民政局将自治区民政厅下拨的扶持社会福利生产专项资金１２万元，长期无偿地让给本局劳动服务公司用于经商，锡林郭勒盟民政处、磴口县民政局都有这种情况。
    五，用民政事业费请客、送礼、滥发实物和补贴。巴彦淖尔盟磴口县民政局两年内用社会救济福利费请客招待款达１９２８０元，其中１９８７年７月至９月宴请４８次。
    去年１１月，内蒙古自治区党委通报批评民政部门违犯财经纪律的情况，但有关部门至今没有着手处理。
