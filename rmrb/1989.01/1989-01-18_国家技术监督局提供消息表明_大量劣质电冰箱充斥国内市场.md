    The State Bureau of Technical Supervision has reported that since the second half of last year, a large number of substandard refrigerators have appeared in the markets of Jiangsu, Shanxi, Liaoning, Beijing, Shaanxi, Anhui, and other provinces, causing many units and individuals to be deceived and suffer losses. Among the more than ten thousand letters of complaint received by the China Consumer Association in the third quarter of last year regarding the quality of household electrical appliances, half were complaints about refrigerators.

    According to investigations, the 20 brands of refrigerators with the most concentrated complaints and the most problems were produced by 27 enterprises. These 27 enterprises are not the designated production plants identified by the Ministry of Light Industry, but rather some assembly plants with poor equipment. Among them, 19 are enterprises in Hangzhou City, Zhejiang Province, and some nearby counties. Some refrigerators with the same brand name are produced by seven or eight different enterprises. For example, a certain unit in Taiyuan City purchased 278 substandard Hitachi-brand refrigerators worth 500,000 yuan from Zhejiang, produced by four enterprises: Yuyao Refrigerator Factory, Jingdezhen Refrigerator Factory Lintian Branch, Lintian Environmental Protection Equipment Factory, and Hangzhou Lintian Refrigerator Factory. However, another unit in Taiyuan City purchased 200 Hitachi-brand refrigerators from Hangzhou City, and the production units changed to Hangzhou Huaxing Refrigerator Factory Branch, Yuhang County Huaxia Electrical Appliances General Factory, Hangzhou Tingzhi Refrigerator Factory, Hangzhou Xiaoshan Huazhi Electrical Appliances Factory, and Hangzhou General Electrical Appliances Factory.

    These substandard refrigerators, assembled by different manufacturers, have serious problems with their internal quality, appearance, and labeling. People are hoping that relevant departments will take effective measures to address these issues.

### 国家技术监督局提供消息表明  大量劣质电冰箱充斥国内市场

　　国家技术监督局提供消息表明
    大量劣质电冰箱充斥国内市场
    据新华社北京１月１７日电  （记者徐克洪）国家技术监督局提供的消息说，自去年下半年以来大量劣质电冰箱出现在江苏、山西、辽宁、北京、陕西、安徽等地市场，使不少单位和个人受骗上当。中国消费者协会去年第三季度接到的有关家用电器质量方面的一万多件群众投诉信中，有一半是投诉电冰箱的。
    据查，投诉比较集中、问题较多的２０个牌号电冰箱是由２７家企业生产的。这２７家企业都不是轻工业部确定的定点生产厂，而是一些设备简陋的装配厂，其中有１９家是浙江省杭州市和附近一些县的企业。有的同一牌号电冰箱却出自七、八家企业之手。如太原市某单位从浙江购进的价值５０万元的２７８台劣质日芝牌电冰箱，生产企业有余姚冰箱厂、景德镇冰箱厂临安分厂、临安环境保护设备厂、杭州临安冰箱厂４家；而太原市另一单位从杭州市购进的２００台日芝牌电冰箱，生产单位却变成了杭州华星冰箱一分厂、余杭县华夏家电总厂、杭州亭趾电冰箱厂、杭州萧山华芝电器厂、杭州通用电器厂等。
    这些由不同厂家拼凑起来的劣质电冰箱内在质量和外观、标识都存在严重问题。人们期待有关部门切实管一管。
