	U.S. continues talks with PLO with conditions

	According to a report by a Lebanese weekly today, the United States has set the condition that the uprising of Palestinians in the occupied territories must end within three months for successful talks with the PLO.

	The United States and the PLO held their first meeting in Tunis last December. It is reported that the second meeting is scheduled to take place later this month.

	The weekly said that the United States has also proposed that a provisional Palestinian government can be established before the uprising in the occupied territories ends, but a Jew who has resided in the occupied territories since 1967 must participate to discuss the issue of Jewish settlements.

	Jordanian Times reveals Israeli plot to seize Jerusalem holy sites

	The Jordanian Times reported today that the chairman of the Donations and Islamic Affairs Council based in Jerusalem, Alami, has called on King Hussein of Jordan to thwart Israel's attempt to seize the Islamic holy sites in Jerusalem by force.

	Alami said that the Israeli authorities are formulating a plan under which the Al-Aqsa Mosque located in the eastern part of Jerusalem will come under the jurisdiction of the Israeli mayor of Jerusalem.

　　美国继续同巴解会谈附有条件
    《约旦时报》披露以阴谋夺取耶路撒冷圣地
    新华社贝鲁特１月１６日电  据黎巴嫩一家周刊今天报道，美国把在三个月内结束被占领土巴勒斯坦人的起义作为与巴解组织举行成功的谈判的条件。
    美国和巴解组织去年１２月在突尼斯举行了第一次会晤，据报道，按计划第二次会晤将在本月晚些时候举行。
    这家周刊说，美国还建议，在被占领土结束起义之前可以成立巴勒斯坦临时政府，但必须有一名自１９６７年以来居住在被占领土的犹太人参加，以便讨论犹太人定居点问题。
    新华社安曼１月１６日电　据《约旦时报》今天报道，以耶路撒冷为基地的捐献和伊斯兰事务理事会主席阿拉米呼吁约旦国王侯赛因，挫败以色列企图强行夺取耶路撒冷的伊斯兰圣地的阴谋。
    阿拉米说，以色列当局正在制订一项计划，根据这项计划，座落在耶路撒冷东城的阿克萨清真寺将置于以色列的耶路撒冷市长管辖之下。
