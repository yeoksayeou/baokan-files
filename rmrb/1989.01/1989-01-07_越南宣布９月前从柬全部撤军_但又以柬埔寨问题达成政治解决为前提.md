Vietnam Announces Withdrawal from Cambodia by September, Pending Political Settlement

Vietnam has announced that it will withdraw all its troops from Cambodia by September, but with the condition that a political solution to the Cambodian issue is reached.

Xinhua News Agency, Hanoi, January 6th - The deputy director of the Vietnamese Foreign Ministry's Information Department, Hu Cai Lan, announced today that the Vietnamese government and the Phnom Penh regime have decided that if a political solution to the Cambodian issue is reached, Vietnam will withdraw all its troops from Cambodia by September this year.

However, Vietnam's announced withdrawal is conditional. Hu Cai Lan said that while Vietnam withdraws, there must be a ceasefire within Cambodia, an end to all foreign military aid to all parties in Cambodia, an end to the provision of "sanctuaries," and an end to interference in Cambodia's internal affairs. She emphasized: "All of these will be implemented under effective international supervision."

According to foreign news reports, at a meeting held in Phnom Penh today to mark the 10th anniversary of Vietnam's invasion of Cambodia, the leader of the Phnom Penh regime, Hun Sen, made a similar announcement. He also rejected the demand by the Cambodian resistance forces that the Phnom Penh regime must dissolve itself before free and fair elections can be held.

Vietnamese leader Nguyen Co Thach attended the meeting.

Xinhua News Agency, Bangkok, January 6th - A spokesperson for the Thai Foreign Ministry said at a press conference held at the Thai Foreign Ministry this afternoon that if the news that Vietnam will withdraw all its troops from Cambodia by September this year is true, Thailand welcomes this.

The spokesperson made these remarks when asked about the announcement by Vietnam and the Phnom Penh regime today that Vietnam's troops will withdraw from Cambodia by September this year. The spokesperson said: "If this news is true, it is good news, it is something to be happy about, and Thailand welcomes it."

    越南领导人阮文灵出席了大会。
