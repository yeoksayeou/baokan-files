Open Government Affairs and Accept Supervision: Lianjiang County Strengthens Anti-Corruption Institutions

Xinhua News Agency, Fuzhou, January 24th - (Reporter Chuyanyi, Correspondent JiaShui, GuoZhen) Fujian Province's Lianjiang County has implemented open government affairs and strengthened anti-corruption institutions, effectively ensuring the clean governance of party and government agencies and the cadre team.

In July 1987, the Lianjiang County Committee established a "monthly meeting" system with representatives from various sectors and the masses to timely report major issues in work. The county government also set up a "Government Affairs Bulletin" column in the main streets of the county seat, regularly publishing policies and measures that the masses are concerned about, as well as the handling processes and results of major issues in work, to inform the entire county. Last year, the county handled 43 cases of "agricultural to non-agricultural" transfers and 11 recruitment cases entirely through open procedures, with no instances of "pulling strings." The public security system regularly publishes the approval status of people applying to emigrate abroad and the collection and payment status of fines by various grassroots police stations, and accepts public inquiries. The tax system has fully implemented the "three opens" tax collection system of tax law, tax burden, and tax policy. Each grassroots tax unit organizes a democratic tax assessment for the masses in the jurisdiction once every quarter, and then publicly posts the assessed tax amounts and actual payment status of each taxpayer, allowing the masses to supervise. Through open tax collection, the phenomenon of tax collection being entirely dependent on the word of tax officials has been changed. Statistics show that since the implementation of the "three opens" tax collection system, the monthly tax revenue from individual households in the county seat has increased by 50,000 to 60,000 yuan, more than doubling the amount before open tax collection. Currently, more than 90% of the party and government departments and units in Lianjiang County have established open procedures for handling affairs.

The county committee also lists integrity as an important part of the assessment of party and government cadres. In the past year, more than 20 cadres in the county's tax and public security departments have been demoted or received other disciplinary actions for not being clean in their governance. The county's disciplinary commission, procuratorate, supervision bureau, as well as public security, industry and commerce, and audit departments have successively established reporting centers, and in grassroots streets, districts, towns, and townships, established a number of reporting stations, "supervision boxes," and "police-citizen communication boxes." A number of cadres with good work styles, strong party spirit, and the courage to uphold principles have been hired as "integrity supervisors," including party representatives, people's congress representatives, retired cadres, workers, and peasant representatives. Currently, they have provided dozens of clues and handling suggestions regarding the illegal, disciplinary, and regulatory violations of party and government cadres to relevant departments.

Statistics show that since 1987, Lianjiang County has, based on the supervision of the masses and functional departments, investigated and dealt with more than 150 party members for illegal and disciplinary violations, with 7 of them being sentenced according to law. The county also investigated and dealt with 83 deputy bureau-level and above cadres for illegally occupying land to build houses, and handled the occupied arable land and already built houses by demolishing houses to return to cultivation, transferring the value to public property, or imposing fines.

　　公开政务　接受监督
    连江县强化廉政制度
    新华社福州１月２４日电（记者褚言义、通讯员嘉水、国贞）福建省连江县实行政务公开，强化廉洁制度，有效地保证了党政机关和干部队伍的为政清廉。
    １９８７年７月开始，连江县委建立起了同各界人士和群众代表的“月谈会”制度，及时通报工作中的重大问题。县政府还在县城主要街道建立了“政务公报”专栏，定期将群众关心的政策措施以及工作中一些重大问题的处理经过和结果，公之于众，晓谕全县。去年，县里对４３名“农转非”、１１名招干，全部实行公开办理，没有出现一例“走后门”现象。县公安系统定期公布审批出国定居人员情况，定期公布各基层派出所对罚没款的收付情况，并接受群众质询。县税务系统全面推行了税法、税负、税政“三公开”的办税制度，各基层税务单位每季度组织辖区群众进行一次民主评税，然后，将评定的各纳税户的税额和实际交纳情况张榜公布，让群众监督。通过公开办税，改变了过去税款收多收少全凭税管人员一张嘴的不正常现象。据统计，推行“三公开”办税制度后，仅县城个体户月纳税额就净增５—６万元，比公开办税前增加一倍多。据统计，目前连江县已有９０％多的党政部门和单位建立起了公开办事的制度。
    县委还把廉洁列为考核党政干部的重要内容。一年来，仅在县税务和公安部门，就有２０多名干部因为政不廉被免职、降职或受其它党纪、政纪处理。县纪委、检察院、监察局，以及公安、工商、审计等部门还相继成立了举报中心，并在基层街、区、乡、镇建立了一批举报点、“监督箱”、“警民联系箱”等，还有一批作风正、党性强，敢于坚持原则的党代表、人大代表、离退休干部、职工和农民代表受聘担任了“廉政监督员”，目前他们已向有关部门提供党政干部违法违纪违章线索和处理建议数十条。
    据统计，１９８７年以来，连江县根据群众和职能部门的监督，查处违法违纪党员１５０多名，其中有７人被依法判刑；还查处非法占地盖房的副局级以上干部８３名，对所占耕地和已盖起的房屋，分别做了拆房还耕、折价归公或罚款等处理。
