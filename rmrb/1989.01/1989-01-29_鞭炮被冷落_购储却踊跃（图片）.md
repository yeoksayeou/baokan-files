	Firecrackers Ignored, Savings Enthusiastically Purchased

	In the past, as soon as the lunar month of La (the twelfth lunar month) began, firecrackers and fireworks would hit the market, and people would rush to buy them. This not only wasted a lot of money but also caused significant public nuisances due to the excessive burning of firecrackers and fireworks. This year, however, a change has occurred in Benxi City, Liaoning Province. Few people are buying firecrackers and fireworks, while more and more people are seen purchasing prize-saving deposits on the streets.

    鞭炮被冷落  购储却踊跃
    以往进入旧历腊月，烟花鞭炮一上市，人们总要争相购买，不但浪费大量资金，而且由于烟花爆竹燃放过多，常常造成公害。今年，在辽宁省本溪市却发生了变化，买烟花鞭炮的人寥寥无几，在街头认购有奖储蓄的人却越来越多。
