The China Association of Business Administration Students in the U.S., headquartered in New York, will send a delegation back to China during this summer vacation to conduct investment and trade consulting activities, aiming to promote the economic construction of the motherland. Preparations are currently underway.

According to sources, the delegation will be divided into four groups, each visiting Tianjin, Shanghai, Guangdong, and Fujian for a two-week consulting mission.

Each subgroup will consist of 4 students studying business administration and 1 student studying law. They are currently raising funds for this work.

The purpose of this consulting activity is threefold:

First, to introduce the U.S. trade and investment environment, analyze methods and channels for entering the U.S. market, and assess the operations of Chinese companies in the U.S. for reference and learning by domestic enterprises.

Second, to provide consulting services on specific issues related to the U.S. market, trade, finance, investment, law, and management methods that domestic enterprises are concerned about, for those enterprises that wish to enter the international market.

Third, to conduct investigations and research, establish files for export-oriented enterprises, and seek business opportunities for coastal regions.

Gong Xiaobing, a member of the board of directors of the association and a student pursuing a Ph.D. in economics at the City University of New York, is in charge of coordinating this consulting work. She said that the focus of this consultation is on private small and medium-sized enterprises to help them enter the international market. When asked about the idea of returning to China for consultation, Gong Xiaobing said, "We want to do some practical work to promote reform and also hope to help improve the domestic mechanism as soon as possible."

The China Association of Business Administration Students in the U.S. is an organization of mainland Chinese students studying in the U.S. It was established in August 1987. At that time, it had only about a dozen members, but now it has grown to 200 members and has set up branches in North Carolina, Maine, Boston, Seattle, Los Angeles, and San Francisco. Most of its members are mainland students who came to the U.S. in 1979, with the majority studying business administration, and a small number studying law and engineering.

　　做实际工作　促祖国建设    
    我旅美学生将回国提供投资贸易咨询
    新华社纽约１月１９日电（记者薛力敏）总部设在纽约的中国旅美商学会将于今年暑假期间派团回国进行投资和贸易咨询活动，以促进祖国的经济建设。目前，准备工作正在积极进行之中。
    据悉，代表团将兵分四路，分别到天津、上海、广东和福建进行为期两周的咨询工作。
    每个分团将由４名学习工商管理和１名学习法律的学生组成。他们目前正在筹集这项工作所需的资金。
    这次咨询活动的目的一是介绍美国的贸易、投资环境，分析打入美国市场的方法与渠道，分析中国驻美公司的经营情况，供国内企业参考与借鉴。
    第二，就国内企业所关心的美国市场、贸易、金融、投资、法律及经营方法等具体问题，给国内想进入国际市场的企业提供咨询。
    第三，进行调查研究，建立国内外向型企业档案，为沿海地区寻找做生意的机会。
    商学会理事、在纽约市立大学攻读经济学博士学位的龚小冰同学负责统筹这次咨询工作。她说，这次咨询的重点对象是民办中小企业，以便推动它们走向国际市场。当记者问到回国咨询的想法是如何产生时，龚小冰说，“我们想做些实际工作，促进改革，也希望有助于尽快改进国内机制。”
    中国旅美商学会是我国大陆旅美学生的组织，成立于１９８７年８月。当时只有１０多名会员，现在已经发展到２００人，并已在北卡罗莱纳州、缅因州、波士顿市、西雅图市、洛杉矶和旧金山等地设立分部。它的成员绝大部分是１９７９年以后来美的大陆留学生，其中大部分是学工商管理的，有一小部分是学习法律和工程的。
