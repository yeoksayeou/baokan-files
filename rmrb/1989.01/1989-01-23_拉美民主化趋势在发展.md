The democratization process in Latin American countries, although facing various difficulties, is still moving towards the direction of expanding and consolidating democratic institutions.

In 1989, Latin America will welcome another election year. Starting from March to the end of the year, more than 10 countries with a population of 180 million (half of the region's population) will hold presidential and parliamentary elections, most of which are normal elections after the military has handed over power to civilians.

In the turbulent Central America, El Salvador will hold elections on March 19 amidst a civil war. Panama's election on May 7 is noteworthy; the election court's designated date has passed, and 10 legal parties have not yet proposed presidential candidates. Honduras' election will be fierce due to sharp domestic contradictions.

In South America, Argentina, Brazil, and Uruguay will all experience the first democratic government transition after ending years of military rule. Argentina's election on May 14 will mainly be a contest between the ruling Radical Civic Union and the Justice Party. On November 15, the Brazilian people will vote directly for the president of the republic for the first time in 25 years. Chile will elect the president and parliament on December 14, and in March next year, Pinochet will hand over power to the elected president, thus ending 17 years of military rule. Bolivia and Uruguay will hold elections in May and November, respectively. Additionally, six countries in the Caribbean, including Belize and Jamaica, are also scheduled to hold elections this year.

So many countries holding elections in one year is not common in Latin American history. It is a result of the democratization process in Latin America in recent years.

The democratization process in Latin America began in the late 1970s. Amidst the people's opposition to dictatorial rule and demand for democratic governance, various countries' military governments had to follow the will of the people and gradually transition to civilian governments. Over the past decade, Latin America's democratic institutions, except for a few countries that experienced setbacks, have generally been consolidated and strengthened.

Since the elected governments in various countries were mostly formed in the face of economic crises and social contradictions, how to get out of the crisis and restore and develop the economy has become the primary task of democratic governments. In recent years, to repay huge foreign debts, curb hyperinflation, and restore and revitalize the economy, the relevant countries have implemented austerity policies and economic structural reforms. Although some progress has been made, at the same time, to varying degrees, some problems have arisen, causing dissatisfaction among some people, leading to frequent strikes in some countries and affecting social stability.

Last year, the economic growth rate in the Latin American region was only 0.7%. Among them, Brazil grew by less than 1%, Argentina grew by about 1%, and Mexico's economy was almost stagnant. Peru's economy declined by 7.5%, and Panama's by 25%. Only Chile, Venezuela, and a few other countries grew by more than 5%. The per capita GDP in the region decreased by 1.5%, the first time since 1982 that it fell below the population growth rate. Meanwhile, the region's inflation rate increased by more than double compared to 1987, reaching 470%. This is due to the region's heavy debt burden and lack of investment. Economic stagnation also puts democratic politics to the test. Therefore, former Mexican President De la Madrid pointed out, "From a long-term perspective, it will weaken the democratic system."

In the new year, economic issues will be one of the focuses of the election campaigns. Newly elected governments will actively explore new and effective ways to restore and develop the economy based on their national conditions, so as to consolidate democratic institutions on the basis of economic development.

How to handle the relationship between elected governments and the military is another issue facing democratic countries in Latin America.

Historically, the military in Latin American countries has not only been a military force but also a powerful political force, with a tradition of political intervention and long-term governance experience. Starting with the military coup in Brazil in 1964, Latin America entered a new era of military rule in the 1960s and 1970s. By the late 1970s, due to the situation, the military gradually handed over power.

The elected governments in various Latin American countries generally pay attention to handling relations with the military, requiring the military to obey the constitution while appropriately taking care of their vested interests. Over the past decade, except for Haiti, there have been no more military coups. However, since last year, military forces in some countries have risen, and there have been cases of partial military opposition to democratic governments. Argentina has experienced three mutinies in two years, although the incidents were peacefully resolved, military dissatisfaction has not been eliminated.

The Brazilian military has a significant influence on national political life. Due to poor economic conditions and intensified party struggles, there were rumors last year that the military might take over the government. On April 16, Uruguay will hold a public referendum to approve or repeal the "amnesty law for the military" already passed by the parliament. The result of the vote will directly affect the military's attitude towards the government and the November election.

In Central America and the Caribbean, after Haiti's election in January last year, there were two military coups and one failed coup. Guatemala experienced multiple failed coups, right-wing military attacks on the president, making the domestic situation very tense. The situation in El Salvador and the Dominican Republic is similar.

The practice of Latin American countries shows that the task of consolidating the democratic system is more difficult than restoring democratic politics. The democratization process in Latin America is facing severe tests in politics, economy, and military affairs.

However, the democratization process in Latin America has indeed become a historical trend and is unlikely to reverse significantly. It will gradually be consolidated and improved as it progresses.

### 拉美民主化趋势在发展

　　拉美民主化趋势在发展
    管彦忠
    拉丁美洲国家的民主化进程虽然面临种种困难，但其趋势仍然是朝着扩大和巩固民主制度的方向发展。
    １９８９年，拉丁美洲迎来了又一个选举年。从３月开始到年底，将有１０多个国家１．８亿人口（占地区人口的一半）举行总统和议会选举，其中多数是军人“还政于民”之后举行的正常的大选。
    在动乱不定的中美洲，萨尔瓦多将于３月１９日在内战的环境中举行大选。巴拿马５月７日的选举引人注目，选举法庭确定的日期已过，１０个合法政党均仍未提出总统候选人，洪都拉斯的大选由于国内矛盾尖锐，将争夺激烈。
    南美洲的阿根廷、巴西和乌拉圭都将是结束军人多年统治之后，首次实现民主政府的交替。阿根廷５月１４日的大选将主要是执政的激进公民联盟与正义党的角逐。１１月１５日，巴西人民２５年来将首次直接投票选举共和国总统。智利１２月１４日选举总统和议会，明年３月皮诺切特向民选总统交权，从而结束长达１７年的军人统治。玻利维亚和乌拉圭将分别于５月和１１月举行大选。此外，加勒比地区的伯利兹、牙买加等６国也预定今年举行大选。
    这么多的国家在一年之内都要举行大选，在拉美的历史上是并不常见的。它是近年来拉美民主化进程所产生的结果。
    拉美民主化进程始于７０年代末期。在人民反对独裁统治、要求实现民主制的浪潮中，各国军政府不得不顺应民心，逐步向文官政府过渡。１０年来，拉美的民主制度除在个别国家曾出现过反复外，总的来看得到了巩固和加强。
    由于各国的民选政府大多是在经济出现危机、社会矛盾激化的形势下产生的，因此，如何摆脱危机、恢复和发展经济也就成了民主政府面临的首要任务。这些年来，为了偿还巨额外债，抑制恶性通货膨胀，恢复和振兴经济，有关国家执行紧缩政策，改革经济结构。这虽然取得了某些成效，但同时也在不同程度上出现了一些问题，引起了一些人的不满，致使有些国家罢工时有发生，影响社会安定。
    去年拉美地区的经济增长率仅为０．７％，其中巴西增长不到１％，阿根廷只增长１％左右，墨西哥经济也几乎处于停滞状态，秘鲁下降７．５％，巴拿马下降２５％，只有智利、委内瑞拉等国增长５％以上。地区人均国内生产总值下降１．５％，自１９８２年以来首次低于人口增长率。与此同时，全地区的通货膨胀率比１９８７年增加一倍以上，高达４７０％。这是由于该地区债务负担沉重，投资匮乏所致。经济不振，民主政治也面临考验，因此，墨西哥前总统德拉马德里曾指出，“从长远的观点看，它将削弱民主制度”。
    在新的一年里，经济问题将是竞选运动中的焦点之一。新的民选政府将根据本国情况，积极探索恢复和发展经济的新的有效途径，以便在发展经济的基础上巩固民主制度。
    如何处理好民选政府与军队的关系，是拉美民主制国家面对的又一问题。
    在历史上，拉美国家的军队不仅是一支武装力量，也是强大的政治力量，有干预政治的传统，也有长期执政的经验。从１９６４年巴西军事政变开始，在６０和７０年代拉美进入了新一轮军政权时代。到７０年代末为形势所迫，军人才逐渐交出政权。
    拉美各国的民选政府，一般都注意处理好与军队的关系，要求军人服从宪制，同时适当照顾他们的既得利益。１０年来，除海地外没有再发生军事政变。可是去年以来，军人势力在一些国家有所抬头，出现了部分军人与民主政府对抗的局面。阿根廷两年中发生了３次兵变，事件虽得到和平解决，但军人的不满情绪并未消除。
    巴西军队对国家政治生活影响较大。由于经济状况不佳，党派之争激化，去年曾一度传闻军方可能接管政权。乌拉圭４月１６日举行公民投票，决定批准或废除已由议会通过的“赦免军人法”，投票的结果将直接影响到军人对政府的态度及１１月的大选。
    在中美洲和加勒比，去年１月海地大选之后发生了两次军事政变和一起未遂政变。危地马拉多次发生未遂政变，右翼军人向总统发难，使国内局势十分紧张。在萨尔瓦多、多米尼加共和国，情况也大体如此。
    拉美国家的实践说明，巩固民主体制的任务比恢复民主政治更加艰难，拉美的民主化进程正经受政治、经济、军事方面的严峻考验。
    但是，拉美民主化的进程毕竟已成为历史的潮流，难以会有大的逆转，它将在前进中逐步得到巩固和完善。
