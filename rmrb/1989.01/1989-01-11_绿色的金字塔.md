The pyramids of Egypt are well-known to the world, but the pyramids of Romania—the green biological pyramids—are little known.

A few years ago, when the People's Daily delegation visited Romania, we listened with great interest to the introduction of the biological pyramid by colleagues from the Romanian Central Institute of Biology.

This biological pyramid is located about 100 kilometers northwest of the capital, Bucharest, in the city of Pitesti. It was started in 1984 and completed after a year of hard work. Its scale is about one-tenth of the Egyptian pyramids. The pyramid has five layers, each of which is a water surface. The total water surface area is 2,000 square meters, and each hectare of water surface can grow 5 tons of plants per day. From top to bottom, there is a 1,300-meter-long spiral pipeline connecting the layers. The entire pyramid is a greenhouse, heated by biogas. The bottom layer has a laboratory that processes aquatic plants on-site every day, turning them into feed and fuel, and conducts related scientific research. Despite its size, the pyramid usually has only 5 workers, and relevant scientific experts visit regularly to provide guidance and conduct research.

Another function of the biological pyramid is to treat sewage. Sewage is drawn into the top layer of the pyramid after being treated and left to settle, and then it undergoes layer-by-layer cyclic action. After 5 hours, it flows to the bottom of the pyramid and becomes clean water, with a purification rate of 90% to 93%, basically meeting health standards and suitable for fish farming. The pyramid can treat 600 cubic meters of sewage per day. Based on this calculation, one biological pyramid can treat the domestic sewage of 50,000 urban residents in a year. The ingenious design makes the biological pyramid produce unique effects. The owner told us that the aquatic plants inside the pyramid are not affected by any pests or diseases from the ground, so the plants grow lushly without the need for pesticides. Moreover, due to the special structure of the pyramid, it can withstand earthquakes of up to magnitude 7.

How wonderful! After the introduction, we became very interested in the biological pyramid. Unfortunately, it was winter, and Romania was covered in ice and snow, making transportation inconvenient and preventing us from visiting the site. The Romanian colleagues who introduced the situation seemed to understand our feelings at the time and immediately took out a large stack of photos of the biological pyramid. In this way, our curiosity was partially satisfied. In the photos, we saw the biological pyramid standing like a giant on the grassland, with windmills used for power generation rotating on the top of the tower. Through the bright glass, the water lilies on the five layers of water surfaces were lush and green, and various pipelines crisscrossed. Workers were busy at their posts.

The designer of the biological pyramid, biologist Dr. Maria Codianu, pointed to the photos and proudly told us: They had beautiful dreams for ecological management, and now the dream had become a reality. The biological pyramid has won the favor of the scientific community, and even physicists who previously looked down on it have changed their minds. Now, the institute has collaborated with 14 relevant research institutes nationwide to conduct multidisciplinary research in the biological pyramid laboratory. She said that they plan to build 4 more similar biological pyramids. After a moment of thought, she said, "We do not think we have solved all the problems, but at least we have made a good start."

Romanian scientists' innovative spirit in ecological management is commendable. We congratulate them on their achievements and wrote in the guest book: "Let life be full of green, protecting the environment is a common responsibility of mankind."

　　绿色的金字塔
    本报记者  钱志新
    埃及的金字塔世人皆晓，罗马尼亚的金字塔——绿色的生物金字塔，却鲜为人知。
    年前，我们人民日报代表团访罗时，饶有兴趣地听了罗马尼亚中央生物学研究所的同志对生物金字塔的介绍。
    这座生物金字塔座落在离首都布加勒斯特西北部约１００公里处的皮特什蒂市，是１９８４年动工、经过一年时间奋战建成的。规模约为埃及金字塔的１／１０。金字塔共分５层，每层都是一个水面，水面总面积为２０００平方米，水面上生长植物，每天每公顷水面可生长５吨植物。金字塔从上到下有一条长１３００米的盘旋管道相连。整个塔内是一个温室，取暖来自沼气。最底层有一个实验室，每天就地加工水生植物，使之变成饲料和燃料，同时做有关的科学研究。偌大一个金字塔，平时的工作人员却只有５人，有关科研专家则定期到那里去作指导并开展研究工作。
    生物金字塔的另一个作用是处理污水。污水经静止处理抽入金字塔顶层，然后经过层层循环作用，５小时后流到塔底即变成了清水，净化程度为９０％—９３％，基本达到了卫生标准，可以用来养鱼。金字塔每天可净化污水６００立方米。据此计算，一座生物金字塔一年可使５万城镇居民的家庭生活污水得到处理。独具匠心的设计使生物金字塔产生奇特的效应。主人告诉我们，塔里的水生植物从地面以上不受任何病虫害侵蚀，所以植物不用施农药也很茂盛。同时由于金字塔结构特殊，可抗御七级地震。
    真是妙极了！听了介绍，我们对生物金字塔顿时产生了浓厚的兴趣。可惜时值隆冬，罗马尼亚冰雪遍地，交通不便使我们未能实地参观。介绍情况的罗马尼亚同志似乎很理解我们此时的心情，当即拿出一大迭生物金字塔的照片。这样，我们的好奇心部分地得到了满足。照片上，只见生物金字塔如巨人一般矗立在草原上，用来发电的风车在塔顶上转动，透过明亮的玻璃，５层水面上的水浮莲郁郁葱葱，各种管道纵横交错，工作人员正在各自的岗位上忙碌着。
    生物金字塔的设计者、生物学女博士玛·科迪亚努指着照片自豪地告诉我们：她们为治理生态环境曾有过美妙的梦想，现在梦已经变成现实。生物金字塔博得科学界普遍青睐，连过去冷眼相视的物理学家也改变了看法。现在，生物所已经和全国１４个有关研究所开展合作，在生物金字塔实验室里联合进行多学科的研究。并说有计划再建造４座类似的生物金字塔。她略加思索后说，我们并不认为解决了所有的问题，但现在毕竟有了一个良好的开端。
    罗马尼亚科学家在治理生态环境中的独创精神值得赞赏，我们对他们取得的成就表示热烈祝贺，在贵宾留言簿上欣然题辞：“让生活中充满绿色，保护环境是人类共同的责任。”
