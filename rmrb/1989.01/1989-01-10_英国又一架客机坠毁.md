A Boeing 737 passenger plane carrying 126 people was forced to make an emergency landing due to engine failure and crashed on the left side of the M1 highway near Kegworth in Leicestershire, England, last night.

This is the second major air disaster in less than three weeks since the Lockerbie air disaster, which claimed 270 lives. According to the latest report from the British Broadcasting Corporation, 43 people died and about 80 were injured. It is reported that this aircraft was only put into service 12 weeks ago.
