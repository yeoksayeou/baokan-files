Title: Hu Feng's "Thirty-Ten-Thousand-Word" Document Republished
Author:
Date: 1989-01-03
Edition: 5

The fourth issue of 1988 of *New Literary Materials* republished Hu Feng's *Report on the Situation of Literary Practice Since Liberation*. The article is divided into four parts: 1. A brief overview of the past few years; 2. Explanatory materials on several theoretical issues; 3. Examples of facts and on party spirit; 4. Suggestions for reference. It is approximately twenty-seven thousand characters long.

Mei Zhi wrote an article stating: From March to July 1954, Hu Feng wrote *Report on the Situation of Literary Practice Since Liberation*—later known as the "Thirty-Ten-Thousand-Word" document. In January 1955, *Literary Gazette* issues 1 and 2 published the second and fourth parts of the *Report* under the title *Hu Feng's Opinions on Literary Issues*, in a separate pamphlet. Critiques of Hu Feng's literary thoughts were also printed at the end. The first and third parts of the *Report* were also printed and distributed within a certain internal range.

This time, in addition to what *Literary Gazette* had previously published, the first part, *A Brief Overview of the Past Few Years*, has been republished, retaining Hu Feng's original annotations.

### 胡风的“三十万言”重新发表

专栏：

　　胡风的“三十万言”重新发表
    《新文学史料》一九八八年第四期重新发表了胡风的《关于解放以来的文艺实践情况的报告》。文章分四部分：一、几年来的经过简况；二、关于几个理论性问题的说明材料；三、事实举例和关于党性；四、作为参考的建议。共约二十七万字。
    梅志为此撰文说：一九五四年三月至七月，胡风写了《关于解放以来的文艺实践情况的报告》——即以后所谓的“三十万言”。一九五五年一月，《文艺报》一、二号以《胡风对文艺问题的意见》为标题，以单册形式公开附发了《报告》的二、四部分，并在后面附印了批判胡风文艺思想的两篇文章。《报告》的第一、二部分也铅印成册，在内部一定范围分发。
    这次重新发表了除《文艺报》曾公开印发过的外，增加了第一部分《几年来的经过简况》，保留了胡风本人的注解。
