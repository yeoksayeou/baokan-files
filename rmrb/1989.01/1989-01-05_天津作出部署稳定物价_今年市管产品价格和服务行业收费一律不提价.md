Editor's Note: The effort to ensure that the price increase this year is significantly lower than last year is the key task of the current rectification and restructuring work. All economic work should be centered around this goal.

Before the New Year, Premier Li Peng pointed out at the fourth plenary session of the State Council: While controlling the rise in prices, we must strive to increase the supply of market-appropriate products that are closely related to people's daily lives. Local governments should work hard to ensure the production and supply of foodstuffs, especially in large cities, to focus on the production and sales of vegetables, using "vegetable gardens" to maintain "vegetable baskets," which is an important factor in stabilizing prices. Tianjin Municipal Government's proactive measures to stabilize prices and increase supply are worth promoting. With the Spring Festival approaching, all localities should organize the supply of the festival market, so that the people can have a happy and prosperous New Year.

According to a report by reporter Xiao Zhi, the decision was made at the third plenary session of the Tianjin Municipal Committee of the Communist Party of China, which concluded three days before the New Year: The focus in 1989 will be on stabilizing prices and deepening reform. The Tianjin Municipal Government clearly stated that, except for national unified regulations, the prices of municipal-managed products and service industry charges in Tianjin in 1989 will remain at the 1988 level.

The Tianjin Municipal Government decided to take the following measures to stabilize prices:

	- The retail prices of grains and oils supplied to urban residents on a quota basis will remain unchanged. The retail prices of pork, mutton, beef, eggs, and sugar within the quota supply range will remain stable at the July 1988 level. This year, the number of contract-purchased vegetable varieties will be increased, and the state-operated volume will be expanded. At the same time, strict control will be exercised over vegetable prices in agricultural markets.

	- Stabilize the prices of daily industrial products closely related to people's daily lives. The prices of 19 daily industrial products produced in this city will not be adjusted from now on, and production will be increased to ensure supply.

	- Strengthen the price management of production materials. Production materials within the plan must be strictly executed according to the prices stipulated by the state. Important production materials outside the plan must be executed according to the unified maximum limit price.

	- The charges for public utilities and service industries closely related to people's lives will not be increased this year.

	- The retail prices of the same commodity operated by state-owned, collective, and individual enterprises must all be executed according to the unified wholesale-retail price difference pricing method. It is strictly forbidden to purchase goods at retail prices or higher and then sell them at a higher price.

	- All state-owned, collective, and individual enterprises must implement a clear pricing system. Labels will be uniformly supervised by the Municipal Price Bureau. When selling goods, the brand name, origin, purchase price, wholesale-retail price difference, retail price, and service project charges of each commodity must be publicly announced. All transactions must have delivery notes, and "white receipts" and "additional tickets" are not allowed.

	- Great efforts will be made to rectify the prices in agricultural markets. The municipal government requires all price supervision and management departments to rely on the masses to do a good job in price supervision and inspection. Severe penalties will be imposed on those who inflate prices, monopolize the market, and harm the people.

　　天津作出部署稳定物价
    今年市管产品价格和服务行业收费一律不提价
    编者按：努力做到今年物价上涨幅度明显低于去年，是今年治理整顿工作的中心任务，一切经济工作都应围绕这个中心来做。
    元旦前，李鹏总理在国务院第四次全体会议上指出：在控制物价上涨的同时，要努力增加市场适销对路的、与人民日常生活有密切关系的产品。各级政府要努力做好副食品的生产与供应，特别要重视大城市蔬菜的生产和销售，以“菜园子”保“菜篮子”，这是保持物价稳定的重要因素。天津市政府采取措施稳定物价、增加供给的积极做法值得提倡。春节即将来临，各地要组织好节日市场的供应，让人民群众高高兴兴地过好年。
    本报讯　记者肖荻报道：元旦前３天结束的中共天津市委五届三次会议作出决议：１９８９年要以稳定物价为中心，搞好治理整顿工作，全面深化改革。天津市政府明确指出，除国家统一规定外，１９８９年天津市管产品价格和服务行业收费一律维持在１９８８年水平。
    天津市政府决定采取以下措施稳定物价：
    ——城镇居民定量供应的粮、油销售价格一律不动。定量供应范围内的猪肉、羊肉、牛肉、鸡蛋和食糖的零售价格一律稳定在１９８８年７月份的水平上。今年将增加蔬菜合同定购品种和扩大国营经营量，同时严格控制农贸市场菜价。
    ——稳定同群众日常生活关系密切的日用工业品价格。本市生产的１９种日用工业品，从现在起，价格一律不作调整，并要增加生产，保证供应。
    ——加强对生产资料的价格管理，计划内生产资料必须严格按照国家规定的价格执行，计划外重要生产资料，必须执行统一最高限价。
    ——同群众生活关系密切的公用事业和服务行业收费，今年不得提高。
    ——国营、集体、个体经营同一商品的零售价格，都要执行统一的批零差率作价办法，严禁以零售价格或高于零售价格进货，再加价销售。
    ——所有国营、集体、个体经营，一律实行明码标价制度，标签由市物价局统一监制，出售商品时必须把每种商品的品名、产地、进价、批零差率、零售价以及服务项目的收费标准公布于众。所有交易行为都必须有发货票，不准“白条入账”和“票外加票”。
    ——大力整顿农贸市场价格。市政府要求各物价管理监督部门依靠广大群众，搞好物价监督检查。对哄抬物价、欺行霸市、坑害群众的行为要严加惩处。
