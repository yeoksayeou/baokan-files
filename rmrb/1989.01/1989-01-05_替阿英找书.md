	Helping Ah Ying Find Books
	Jiang Chengbo

	After a decade of turmoil, I was fortunate to have preserved several letters from Comrade Ah Ying. One of them reads:

	"Comrade Chengbo: I have received the books you sent, including 'Memoirs of Eastern Travel'.... 'Memoirs of Eastern Travel' contains a volume of documents from the patriotic movement of overseas students at that time, which is very valuable. I should thank you for your help.... I have not been able to go south recently, but no matter what, I will definitely come south once, to Suzhou to visit and express my gratitude. I also plan to compile a bibliography of ballad lyrics and late Qing poetry and prose collections in the future. Respectfully yours, Ah Ying, March 13th"

	This excerpt is from a letter Ah Ying wrote to me on March 13, 1962. At that time, I often traveled to northern Jiangsu, including Taizhou, Xinghua, and Yancity, to collect books. On that occasion, I obtained a late Qing edition of 'Memoirs of Eastern Travel,' and after sending it to him, he gave it a very high evaluation.

	My acquaintance with Ah Ying was introduced by Comrade Zhou Yibai. In 1958, we purchased a batch of late Qing period books printed on local paper and glossy paper with lithography, including 'Game Newspaper,' 'Flying Shadow Hall Illustrated Newspaper,' and 'Illustrated Daily.' At that time, Zhou's family was still working in Suzhou, so he would return to Suzhou from Beijing during his vacation. Every afternoon, he would come to the bookstore, and these illustrated newspapers caught his eye. He asked me to hold them for him and immediately wrote to Ah Ying. About three days later, we received a telegram from Beijing saying, 'Illustrated newspapers decided to purchase.' The speed was unexpected. From then on, he often wrote to me, proposing book titles he wanted to visit and specific requirements. What he wanted were not Song, Yuan, Ming woodblock prints or famous annotated editions, but late Qing lithographed small volumes that were often overlooked by people. These included notes, novels, ballad lyrics, songbooks, newspapers, magazines, poetry, and prose collections. Because I continuously provided him with a large amount of book and material resources, he was very happy and repeatedly expressed his desire to come to Suzhou in person.

	On June 15 of that year, he wrote to me, "In the past month, I have visited Datong (Yungang), Taiyuan, Luoyang (Longmen), and Xi'an, four places, and returned home the night before last.... The four places I visited only bought a few very ordinary books. If I set out again, it might be to go south." This shows that the attraction of Suzhou's antique bookstores to him was very strong.

	Later, he bought a lot of 'Bamboo Branch Poems,' preparing to compile a collection. At that time, I was entrusted by the Institute of Literature of the Chinese Academy of Sciences to collect a large number of Ming and Qing poetry and prose collections, so I took the opportunity to browse the contents while copying the catalogs. If the poems contained 'Bamboo Branch Poems,' I would copy them and send them to him. Over time, the number accumulated, making him very excited. He sent me his self-published books, 'Legend of Leifeng Pagoda,' 'Literature of the Opium War,' and 'Collection of Anti-American Labor Restrictions,' with my name and his personal signature on the title pages. Unfortunately, during the Cultural Revolution, the books were taken away and their whereabouts are still unknown.

	My relationship with Ah Ying was not just that of a reader and a bookseller; in essence, it can be said to be that of a teacher and a student. Once, in Zhejiang, I obtained a Qing dynasty woodblock print, 'Waiting for the Phoenix Hall,' by the author of the 'Jian Society.' I wanted to transcribe it and wrote to seek his opinion. He quickly replied, suggesting that I ask Professor Fan Yanqiao nearby to take a look. At the same time, he advised me to pay attention to whether the content involved the Li Zicheng part and was too bad, and it would be better to consider it carefully before deciding whether to transcribe it. He also told me about 'Hongxue Mountain Room Collection' by Wu Yan, which has two editions: the initial edition from the Jiaqing period and the later reprinted edition. Generally speaking, the earliest edition is the best, but its content does not include poems about the Opium War, so from the perspective of using materials, the latter is still better.

	The wealthy families in Suzhou's Dongting East Mountain have, since ancient times, had male owners who often went out to do business, while the female family members stayed at home, reading ballad lyrics and novels for entertainment. Some even copied them themselves, so a large number of Qing dynasty Guanjia and hand-copied ballad lyrics were preserved among the people. Unfortunately, due to the passage of time, complete volumes have become rare, but incomplete volumes were still quite common in the early days of the founding of the country. Therefore, I preserved the books I collected one after another. Once, I mentioned this in a letter, and he eagerly hoped that this batch of ballad lyrics could be given to him as an important reference for compiling the 'Ballad Lyrics Catalog.' In the end, his wish was fulfilled.

	Due to his busy work, his plan to go south was never realized. On October 2, 1976, he quietly arrived in Suzhou. As soon as he got off the train, he expressed his wish to visit Suzhou's antique bookstore. The next day, he came to the bookstore and asked about Jiang Chengbo, but unfortunately, I had been sent down to northern Jiangsu. The gentleman left in disappointment. Soon after returning to Beijing, he passed away. I was unable to see him one last time, which is a lifelong regret.

专栏：

　　替阿英找书
    江澄波
    经过十年动乱，我幸亏保存下几封阿英同志给我的信，其中一件写道：
    “澄波同志：寄来《东游纪念》等书已经收到。……《东游纪念》中有一册收当时留学生爱国运动文献不少，殊可贵。应该谢谢你的帮助。……我最近不得南下，但无论如何终会南来一次，到苏当奉访并面致谢忱。弹词目，晚清诗文集目，今后也想整理出来。匆致敬礼！阿英，十三日”
    这里摘录的是阿英同志在１９６２年３月１３日写给我的信。当时我经常到苏北泰州、兴化、盐城等地访书，那次收到了一部晚清时印的《东游纪念》，把书寄去后，他对此书作了很高的评价。
    我与阿英同志的交往，是由周贻白同志介绍。１９５８年我们从洞庭东山收购到一批晚清时期用土纸和油光纸石印的《游戏报》、《飞影阁画报》、《图画日报》等。那时贻白同志家属还在苏州工作，因而他在假期就从北京回苏州探亲。每天下午常来书店，这些画报被他看到了，就叫我暂为保留，他立即给阿英同志去信。大约过了三天时间，就接到从北京发来“画报决购”的电报。速度之快，出人意外。从此，他就经常来信提出拟访书目和具体要求。他所要的不是宋元明刻和名人钞校本，而是一向不为人们注意的晚清时期铅石印本小册子。包括笔记、小说、弹词、唱本、报刊杂志、诗文集等。由于连续不断地为他提供了大量的图书资料，使他很高兴，一再提出要亲来苏州的愿望。
    就在那年６月１５日他来信告诉我：“一个月来连跑了大同（云岗）、太原、洛阳（龙门）、西安四个地方，前晚才回家，……所走四地，只买了几本极普通的书。若再动身，可能就是南下了。”由此可以看出，苏州古旧书店对他的吸引力是很大的。
    后来他购买了不少《竹枝词》，准备编一汇集。此时我正受中国科学院文学研究所之托，大量收集明清人诗文集，因而利用抄写书目之机，顺便翻阅一下内容，如果诗中有《竹枝词》就抄下寄给他。日积月累，数量较多，使他很兴奋。他以感谢的心情，赠予我他自著的《雷峰塔传奇叙录》、《鸦片战争文学集》、《反美华工禁约集》等书。扉页上还写上我的名字和他的亲笔签名。可惜“文革”期间书被掠走，至今下落不明。
    我和阿英同志不仅仅是读者和营业员的关系，实质上可以说是老师和学生的关系。有一次我在浙江收到一部清初刻本、简社主人著的《麟阁待传奇》，想进行转抄，去信征求他的意见，他很快给我复信，并十分谦虚的建议我就近请范烟桥先生看一下。同时要我注意一下，内容如果涉及李闯部分而又太坏，最好能加以斟酌，然后决定是否传抄。还有清人吴嵰所著《红雪山房集》，他告诉我有嘉庆时初刻本和后来重刻本两种。按一般讲，当以最初刻本为佳，但其内容无鸦片战争诗，所以从使用资料来说，仍以后者为好。
    苏州洞庭东山的大户人家，从古以来，男主人大都外出经商，家属深居闺中，以看弹词小说为消遣，有的还自己抄录，因而在民间保存着大量的清代乾嘉时坊刻和抄本弹词。惜乎由于为时已久，整部全的已较少，残本则在建国初期流出尚多。为此我将陆续收得之书，保存下来。有一次在信上提到了此事，他如饥如渴地希望这批弹词能让给他，作为整理《弹词目录》的重要参考资料，最后终于如愿以偿。
    由于他工作繁忙，南下的计划一直没能实现。１９７６年１０月２日他悄然来到苏州，刚下火车就提出要去苏州古旧书店一走的愿望。翌日来到书店，问及江澄波，不料我已下放苏北，先生遂悻悻而去。返京不久即与世长辞。我未能见到他最后一面，实为终身憾事。
