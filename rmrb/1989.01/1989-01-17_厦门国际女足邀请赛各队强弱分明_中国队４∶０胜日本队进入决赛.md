The teams' strengths and weaknesses are clear in the Xiamen International Women's Football Invitational Tournament; China beats Japan 4-0 to advance to the final

Xiamen, January 16 (Xinhua) -- The Chinese women's football team defeated Japan 4-0 this afternoon, turning their fortunes around in the Xiamen International Women's Football Invitational Tournament.

Fujian team, which had previously drawn with the Chinese team, employed the same tactics again this morning, tying Finland, a team with high hopes for the championship, 0-0. As a result, both the Chinese and Finnish teams currently have 7 points, with the Chinese team having a better goal difference. If the two teams draw in the final on the 18th, the Chinese team will be crowned champions. The Finnish team, however, has no other choice but to defeat the Chinese team to win the championship. Judging from the competitive state of both teams today, the Finnish team's chances of winning are slim.

The teams with the lowest points, Xiamen and the Philippine Makati Club, played a match today. National team member Feng Jianhong, playing as a midfielder for Xiamen, scored two goals, leading Xiamen to a 2-0 victory. This result effectively determined the 5th and 6th places for the two teams.

The live broadcast of the final match between China and Finland, scheduled for 2:45 PM on January 18, will be aired by CCTV.

　　厦门国际女足邀请赛各队强弱分明
    中国队４∶０胜日本队进入决赛
    本报厦门１月１６日电  记者汪大昭报道：中国女子足球队今天下午以４∶０战胜日本队，这一结果使她们在厦门国贸杯国际女足邀请赛中的形势，发生了“多云转晴”的变化。
    福建队上一轮逼和了中国队后，今天上午重施故伎，把夺标呼声很高的芬兰队也拖进了困境之中，双方战成０∶０。于是，中国队和芬兰队目前同积７分，中国队净胜球数超过芬兰队，１８日的决战双方如果打平，冠军便是中国队。而芬兰队已无它路可走，想拿冠军就非得战胜中国队。从今天两队表现出的竞技状态来看，芬兰队取胜的可能性不大。
    积分排在最后的厦门队和菲律宾马基沓俱乐部队今天进行了一场比赛。客串厦门队前卫的国家集训队队员冯建红连中两元，厦门队以２∶０获胜。这一结果实际上排出了两队分列第５和第６名的座次。
    １月１８日下午２点４５分，中央电视台将现场直播中芬两队争夺冠军的决赛实况。
