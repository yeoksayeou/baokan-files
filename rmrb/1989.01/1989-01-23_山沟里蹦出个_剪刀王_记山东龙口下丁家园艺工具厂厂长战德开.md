In the depths of autumn, a group of Japanese businessmen visited the Xiadinjia Horticultural Tools Factory in Nanguo Mountain, Longkou City, Shandong Province. As soon as the guests and hosts took their seats, Kuraue Koutaro, a director of the Japanese company Toko Butsu San, took out a copper coin from his pocket and used his Japanese scissors to cut out a 1/4 gap in the coin.

"Well done!" Xiadinjia Horticultural Tools Factory director Zhang Dekei, a man in his fifties, slightly thin, and a native of the mountains, also stood up. He took the copper coin and picked up a pair of "Feiyu" brand scissors. With a "clank," the coin was cut into a 3/4 gap, and the scissors remained intact.

Kuraue Koutaro's smug expression vanished. He raised his thumb and exclaimed, "Feiyu is good, Feiyu is good." He immediately placed an order for 100,000 units on the spot.

Zhang Dekei has such a temperament: the more you underestimate him, the more he wants to prove himself. In 1983, during the national industry evaluation, the "Feiyu" brand scissors won first place. It should have received the "National Excellence" award, but the relevant departments, considering their "status," feared that some state-owned large factories might be jealous, and only wanted to give them a "Ministry Excellence" award.

Zhang Dekei heard this and immediately went to Beijing at night. He barged into the office of the National Award Committee and argued his case, finally bringing back the highest award in the national horticultural tools industry—the National Silver Award—to the factory.

In June 1985, Zhang Dekei, as the only representative of a township enterprise in the Chinese Machinery Delegation, flew to Tokyo to participate in the "20th Annual Excellent Tools Exhibition in All of Japan." Dressed in a suit, he chatted and laughed in the grand exhibition hall. During this exhibition, the three ports of Shanghai, Jiangsu, and Qingdao provided a total order value of $150,000 for exhibition items, of which their single order value accounted for $110,000, causing a sensation locally. Now, "Feiyu" scissors are popular in more than 30 countries and regions, including the United States, Britain, West Germany, and Sweden.

Those who have visited the Xiadinjia Horticultural Tools Factory are often puzzled: the workers here are all native mountain people, and the factory's equipment is simple, so how can they produce such excellent products?

"The key is to improve the quality of people," Zhang Dekei said. He had long realized that although mountain people have the excellent qualities of hard work, honesty, and simplicity, there are still many outdated customs. He once wrote a "self-diagnosis" for himself and the workers: laziness, short-sightedness, fear of risk... a total of 10 problems; then he "prescribed the medicine": "Culture, science, and technology!" Since then, he not only studied books on domestic and international enterprise management but also did not miss out on "fashionable" books such as "Your Misunderstandings," "The Art of Life," "Inferiority and Transcendence," and "Art Philosophy." He also personally compiled a large volume of "Enterprise Management Regulations."

Product quality is largely determined by the quality of people. Now, this factory of nearly 500 people has established more than 20 full-time quality inspectors. Once, they found a scissor blank with insufficient hardness in the workshop. Upon investigation, it turned out that a piece of low-carbon steel had been mixed into the raw materials, casting 40 similar scissor blanks. At that time, these scissor blanks had been mixed into the pile of more than 40,000 scissor blanks. What to do? Zhang Dekei supported their opinion: let the workers check each scissor blank one by one. In this way, the entire factory spent 3 days, finally finding these scissor blanks that did not meet the quality standards.

In these years, the Xiadinjia Horticultural Tools Factory has not had a single quality accident and has been designated by the State Commodity Inspection Bureau as an export-free inspection unit.

He devoted all his heart to the enterprise and told the workers, "For the cause, I have already given up this hundred-and-eighty-pound body." Once, his intestinal adhesion disease relapsed, and he was in the hospital receiving an infusion. Suddenly, an urgent telegram was delivered to his bedside. The foreign trade department wanted him to go to Qingdao immediately to discuss business, as the foreign merchant's deadline was approaching. He could not delay. He pulled out the needle and rushed to Qingdao that night...

Zhang Dekei's efforts have not been in vain. Now, the products of the Xiadinjia Horticultural Tools Factory have developed from the original one variety to 16 varieties, including fruit pruners, thin fruit pruners, hedge trimmers, fruit pickers, and flower pruners. The factory creates a tax revenue of 1.2 million yuan annually and earns 800,000 yuan in foreign exchange through exports.

　　山沟里蹦出个“剪刀王”    
    ——记山东龙口下丁家园艺工具厂厂长战德开
    丁广义
    时值深秋。地处山东龙口市南郭山区的下丁家园艺工具厂来了一批日本客商。宾主刚落座，日本东工物产株式会社的董事户仓皎太郎便从兜里摸出一枚铜币，用他带来的日本剪刀猛剪下去，把铜币剪出１／４的缺口。
    “好哇！”下丁家园艺工具厂厂长战德开，一个５０开外，略显瘦小的山里人也站了起来。他伸手要过铜币，操起一把“飞鱼”牌剪刀，只听“喀嚓”一声，铜币被剪出３／４的缺口，剪刀完好如初。
    户仓皎太郎脸上的得意之色不见了。他翘起大拇指，连声说：“飞鱼好，飞鱼好。”当场订货１０万件。
    战德开就有这么个脾气：你越是小看俺，俺越要干出个样子。１９８３年，在全国同行业评比中，“飞鱼”牌剪刀一举夺魁，照说该拿“国优”，但有关部门考虑到他们的“身份”，怕一些同行国营大厂吃“醋”，只想给个“部优”。
    战德开一听，连夜上了北京。他闯进国家评奖委员会办公室据理力争，终于把全国园艺工具行业的最高奖赏——国家银质奖，捧回厂里。
    １９８５年６月，战德开作为中国机械代表团中唯一的乡镇企业代表，飞赴东京参加“全日本第２０届优良工具展览会”。他西装笔挺，在富丽堂皇的展览大厅谈笑风生。这次展览会，我国上海、江苏、青岛三处口岸共提供了１５万美元展品的订货总额，其中他们一家的订货额就占了１１万美元，在当地引起轰动。现在，“飞鱼”剪畅销美国、英国、西德、瑞典等３０多个国家和地区。
    到过下丁家园艺工具厂的人开始都不免纳闷：这里工人都是土生土长的山里人，厂里的设备也简陋，怎么会有这么出色的产品呢？
    “关键在提高人的素质。”这就是战德开的秘诀。他早就看到，山里人虽有吃苦耐劳、质朴诚实的优良品质，但还有不少落后的习俗哩。他曾为自己、也为职工开了一份“自我诊断书”：散慢自由，目光短浅，怕担风险……共有１０种毛病；然后“对症下药”，开出药方：“文化，科学技术！”从此，他不但发奋攻读起国内外企业管理方面的书籍，甚至连《你的误区》、《生活的艺术》、《自卑与超越》、《艺术哲学》等“时髦”书也不放过。他还亲自编写了一大本《企业管理条例》。
    产品质量在很大程度上决定于人的素质。如今，这个近５００人的工厂设立了２０多名专职质量检查员。有一次，他们在车间发现一块硬度不够的剪坯，一查，原来是原料中混杂进一条低碳钢，铸造出４０件类似的剪坯。当时，这些剪坯已混杂在那堆积如山的４万多件剪坯之中。怎么办？战德开支持他们的意见：让工人对剪坯逐一进行翻检。就这样，全厂花费了３天时间，终于查出了这些不合质量标准的剪坯。
    这些年来，下丁家园艺工具厂没发生一次质量事故，被国家商检局定为出口免检单位。
    把全部心血倾注于企业，他对职工说，“为了事业，俺早把这百八十斤交出去啦”。一次，他肠粘连病复发，正在医院输液，突然，一份加急电报送到床头，外贸部门要他马上去洽谈业务，外商行期在即。不能耽搁。他一把拔下针头，连夜赶往青岛……
    战德开的心血没有白费。现在，下丁家园艺工具厂的产品已由过去的一个品种，发展到果枝剪、稀果剪、整篱剪、采果剪、花枝剪等１６个品种，一年创造税利１２０万元，出口创汇８０万元。
