Recently, I attended a banquet at the Changcheng Hotel. The host was the visiting delegation from the World Headquarters of the Mormon Church. This was their farewell banquet before leaving Beijing. The banquet was conducted according to Mormon customs. The host explained that when Premier Zhao Ziyang visited the United States, they had also followed these customs. The wine glasses on the table were filled with boiled water—genuine cold boiled water, not mineral water. The host raised his glass to make a toast, and after saying "cheers," he did not rush to serve the dishes. Instead, there was ample time for the host and guests, as well as the guests among themselves, to get to know each other. Only then were the cold dishes served, which consisted of a few small dishes: pickled carrot cubes, bamboo shoots, bean sprouts, and dried beef strips, placed in the center for everyone to take as they pleased.

The hot dishes were evenly distributed: two pieces of crispy fried chicken, two stalks of cooked rapeseed, two slices of sweet and sour fish, and two small pieces of roasted duck. There were also four dumplings, a small bowl of clear soup, and a spoonful of sesame stir-fried noodles. At this point, the host raised his glass again to wish China prosperity! After everyone drank this cup of boiled water, the host shook hands with each guest and said their goodbyes. By the time I walked out of the elevator and reached the ground floor, our hosts had already packed their luggage and boarded the bus to the airport to catch their flight.

The Mormon Church emerged in the 1930s during the American religious reform movement. Max Weber, in his study of the origins of modern Western capitalism, highly praised the role of the Protestant ethic of asceticism, which advocated limiting consumption and being faithful to one's work, and saw its affinity with the early capitalist accumulation and entrepreneurial spirit. As the last reformist religion to break away from Christianity, the Mormon Church has a stronger ascetic color and a stronger spirit of exploration. The Mormon Church, mainly composed of farmers and common people, made significant historical contributions to the development and prosperity of the American West. The church has strict behavioral norms, such as abstaining from smoking, alcohol, tea, and all stimulants, not wearing unusual hairstyles, and not wearing miniskirts. In that world of decadence, these rules sometimes became a cleansing agent for the soul.

I do not understand the Mormon scriptures, nor do I believe in their polytheism. However, I think that the Mormon Church's advocacy of a simple and frugal lifestyle has similarities with the ancient Chinese tradition of Mohism and self-reliance. When we introduce Western technology and capital, why can't we also learn from this "boiled water" spirit?

　　长城饭店的白开水
    王容芬
    日前去长城饭店赴宴，东道主是世界摩门教总部访华团，这是该团离京前的答谢宴会。宴会按摩门教的规矩进行，据主人讲，当年赵紫阳总理访美时，他们也是照此规矩招待的。餐桌上的酒杯里盛的是白开水——真正的凉白开，不是矿泉水。主人举杯致词，“干杯”后没有急急地上菜，主客之间、客人之间有一段充分认识、了解的时间。然后才上来冷盘，不过是几个小菜：腌胡萝卜块、笋块、豆芽菜、干牛肉丝，放在当中，各取所需。
    热菜是平均分配的：两块儿香酥鸡、两根煮油菜、两片糖醋鱼和两小片儿烤鸭，还有四只水饺、一小碗儿清汤、一勺儿芝麻炒面。到此，主人又举杯祝中国昌盛！大家干了这杯白开水后，主人便同客人一一握别，道声珍重……等我走出电梯间，来到饭店底层时，我们的东道主已经提着箱子上了到机场的汽车去赶班机了。
    摩门教是上一世纪３０年代美国宗教革命中兴起的一门新宗教。马克斯·韦伯在考察近代西方资本主义的起源时，高度评价了新教禁欲的天职观的作用，认为它要求教徒限制消费、忠于世间工作岗位的思想同早期资本主义积累、人的创业精神之间有某种亲和性。摩门教作为最后脱离基督教的改革宗教，禁欲色彩比基督新教的教派更浓，开拓精神更强。以农民和平民为主体的摩门教徒为开发和繁荣美国西部做出了它的历史贡献。该教具有严格的行为规范，如戒烟、酒、茶等一切兴奋物，不准留怪发型，不准穿超短裙等。在那个纸醉金迷的世界里，这些清规戒律有时倒成了洗涤灵魂的洁净剂。
    我不懂摩门经，也不信其多神论，但我以为，摩门教徒崇尚艰苦朴素的生活方式，同中国古代的墨家和简朴自强的传统有相通之处，当我们在引进西方的技术、资金时，为什么不能同时借鉴一下这种“白开水”精神呢？
