	Rural Areas Urgently Need to Promote the Marriage Law

	Editor:
	With the arrival of the Spring Festival, the season for marriages will soon be in full swing. Therefore, it is particularly necessary to vigorously promote the Marriage Law and educate the broad masses of cadres and villagers in rural areas on this aspect.

	Currently, in many rural areas, illegal marriages are quite common, mainly manifested in the following ways:

	1. Early Marriage: Marrying before the legal age. Young men and women as young as eighteen or nineteen, or even younger, get married.

	2. Secret Marriage: Reaching the marriageable age but not registering with the relevant departments to complete the marriage procedures, and instead cohabiting illegally.

	3. The most common is neither reaching the marriageable age nor registering for marriage, but instead cohabiting illegally.

	4. Disguised Marriage Purchase: The female party demands a dowry from the male party. If the amount is not met, the female party's family will not allow the daughter to get married.

	5. Swapping Brides: Both or multiple parties swap brides. This phenomenon often occurs in remote, impoverished mountainous areas.

	The reason why illegal marriages are so prevalent is mainly due to two reasons: First, the promotion of the Marriage Law is insufficient, and the broad masses of peasants have a weak sense of legal awareness in this regard. The author once asked a young man, "Will you go to register for a marriage certificate when you get married in the future?" He said, "I won't bother with that." The author said, "That's illegal!" He said, "What law? Who cares!"

	Second, some grassroots cadres are irresponsible and adopt an attitude of turning a blind eye to illegal marriages around them. Some not only do not intervene but also attend the wedding banquets; even worse, some cadres do not set an example themselves, and their children get married before reaching the legal age, so they cannot persuade the masses.

	How can we eliminate the phenomenon of illegal marriages? First, it is suggested that the Women's Federation, Propaganda Department, Communist Youth League, Judicial Department, and Civil Affairs Department should vigorously promote the Marriage Law to enhance the legal awareness of the broad masses of cadres and villagers in rural areas, making them consciously abide by the Marriage Law. Second, for those involved in illegal marriages, they should be criticized and educated, especially for those grassroots cadres and party members who knowingly violate the law, necessary disciplinary actions should be taken.

　　农村亟须大力宣传《婚姻法》
    编辑同志：
    随着春节的到来，男婚女嫁又将进入“旺季”。因此，大力宣传《婚姻法》，对农村广大干部群众进行这方面的教育，就显得十分必要。
    目前，在许多农村，违法婚姻相当普遍，主要表现有以下几种：
    １、早婚。即不到法定结婚年龄而结婚。十八、九岁，甚至连十八、九岁都不到的青年男女就结婚。
    ２、私婚。到结婚年龄而不到有关部门登记办理结婚手续，就非法同居。
    ３、最普遍的是既不到结婚年龄，又不办理结婚手续就非法同居生活。
    ４、变相买卖婚姻。女方向男方索要彩礼，达不到所要的数目，女方家长就不让女儿出嫁。
    ５、换亲。双方或多方相互换亲，这种现象多发生在偏僻的贫困山区。
    违法婚姻现象之所以普遍存在，主要原因有以下两点：一是对《婚姻法》宣传不够，广大农民在这方面的法制观念淡薄。笔者曾问一男青年：“你将来结婚去不去登记领取结婚证？”他说：“我才不去找那个麻烦呢。”笔者说：“那是犯法的呀！”他说：“啥法不法的呀，谁管谁！”二是一些基层干部不负责任，对身边的违法婚姻现象采取听之任之的态度。有的不仅不干预，还去喝喜酒；更有甚者，是某些干部不以身作则，自己的子女不到结婚年龄就结婚，当然也就不能去说服群众了。
    怎样才能消除违法婚姻现象呢？首先，建议妇联、宣传、共青团、司法、民政等部门大张旗鼓地宣传《婚姻法》，增强农村广大干部群众的法制观念，使他们自觉的遵守《婚姻法》。其次对违法婚姻的当事者要给予批评教育，特别是对那些明知故犯的基层干部和党团员，要给予必要的党纪、政纪处分。　方志成
