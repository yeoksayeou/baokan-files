	In meeting with Professor Serro of the United States,
	Zhao Ziyang introduces China's economic situation.
	Adjustment is not a change in the reform and opening-up policy,
	but a study of methods and steps.

	New China News Agency, Beijing, January 19th – (Reporter Zhang Rongdian) The General Secretary of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China, Zhao Ziyang, said today, "Over the past decade, China has made significant economic developments and has undertaken major reforms in the economic system."

	Zhao Ziyang this afternoon met with Professor Serro, the Dean of the Sloan School of Management at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, and his delegation at Zhongnanhai. He introduced China's economic situation.

	Zhao Ziyang said, "China's economy was previously based on a highly centralized planned economic system, but now 50% of production has shifted to market regulation. More than 80% of state-owned enterprises have separated ownership from management, implementing a contract management system."

	He said that according to the reform process, it is necessary to further liberalize commodity prices and allow more enterprises to operate freely, that is, to implement a competitive mechanism for more commodities and enterprises. However, some problems have arisen: first, the economy has overheated, with demand exceeding supply, leading to inflation; second, many aspects of the old centralized planning management methods have been abandoned, but new macro-control measures suitable for the development of a commodity economy have not kept up. Therefore, a period of adjustment is needed, which can also be called a transitional period.

	Zhao Ziyang said that China has now entered a period of adjustment after a period of rapid development and reform. It will take about two years. This adjustment, in terms of economic development, means cooling down the economy; in terms of reform, it means training cadres to learn new macro-control methods and establishing a new economic order. He pointed out that this is, of course, a long-term task, but as a foundation, it needs to be established within a certain period.

	Zhao Ziyang emphasized that adjustment is not a change in the policy of reform and opening up, but rather to better reform and open up. China's policy, direction, and path of reform and opening up have not changed. The current issue is one of methods and steps.

	Professor Serro and his delegation also exchanged views with Zhao Ziyang on the development trends of the world economy. When Serro discussed the issue of economic globalization, Zhao Ziyang believed that China's relationship with the United States, Japan, and the future unified European market is mainly one of mutual benefit and complementarity, with less competition. China's trade relations with them will further develop.

	The American guests were invited to Beijing by the State Council Development Research Center to give lectures. During their stay in Beijing, Professor Serro and his delegation conducted academic exchanges with relevant Chinese units on topics such as "World Economy," "Income Security During Inflation," and "Reform of China's Labor System."

	The Sloan School of Management has trained several economic management personnel for China over the years. Zhao Ziyang praised the good cooperation between the two sides and hoped that both sides would continue to exchange views on China's economic development.

　　在会见美国瑟罗教授一行时
    赵紫阳介绍中国经济形势
    调整不是改变改革开放政策而是研究方法和步骤
    新华社北京１月１９日电  （记者张荣典）中共中央总书记赵紫阳今天在这里说，“十年来，中国在经济上有了较大的发展，在经济体制方面作了较大的改革。”
    赵紫阳今天下午在中南海会见美国麻省理工学院斯隆管理学院院长瑟罗教授一行时，介绍了中国的经济形势。
    赵紫阳说，中国的经济过去基本上是高度集中的计划经济体制，而现在已有５０％的生产转入市场调节，８０％以上的国营企业实现了所有权和经营权分离，实行了经营承包制。
    他说，按照改革的进程，应进一步放开商品价格，使更多的企业放开经营，即对更多的商品和企业实行竞争机制。但现在遇到了一些问题：一是经济发展过热，需求超过了供给，出现了通货膨胀，二是把过去旧的集中计划管理的许多方面的手段废除了，但新的适应商品经济发展的宏观控制办法跟不上。为此，需要一段调整时期，也可以说是过渡时期。
    赵紫阳说，中国现在已进入了大发展、大改革之后的调整时期。它需要两年时间。所谓调整，从经济发展上来说需要降一降温；从改革上讲，是要培训干部，使他们学会新的宏观控制办法，是要建立新的经济秩序。他指出，这当然是个长期的任务，但作为打基础，需要在一定的时期内把它建立起来。
    赵紫阳强调说，调整不是改变改革、开放的政策，而是为了更好地改革和开放。中国改革、开放的方针、方向和要走的道路都没有改变，现在是研究方法和步骤问题。
    瑟罗一行还同赵紫阳就世界经济的发展趋势交换了看法。当瑟罗谈到世界经济集团化问题时，赵紫阳认为，中国同美国、日本及未来的欧洲统一大市场，竞争的成分不多，主要是互利互补的关系。中国同它们的贸易关系会得到进一步的发展。
    美国客人是应国务院发展研究中心邀请来京讲学的。在京期间，瑟罗一行同中国有关单位就“世界经济”、“通货膨胀期间的收入保障”、“中国的劳动制度改革”等问题进行了学术交流。
    斯隆管理学院多年来为中国培训了一些经济管理人员。赵紫阳赞扬了双方的良好合作，并希望双方继续就中国的经济发展问题交换意见。
