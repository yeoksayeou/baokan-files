Tan Shushen, a veteran of the Beijing Military Region's Logistics Department, has invented a fully foldable, multifunctional, portable bicycle after two and a half years of continuous experimentation. This innovation addresses the inconvenience of carrying numerous items while traveling, visiting relatives, or taking public transportation.

Tan Shushen's design incorporates key components such as the handlebar folder, frame folder, and pedal folder. These allow a standard bicycle to be folded into a compact rectangular shape with a volume of just 0.08 cubic meters. If constructed with lightweight steel, the bicycle would weigh between 10 to 15 kilograms. It can be folded and unfolded in just one minute, making it highly portable for travel, business trips, or visiting friends and family. This bicycle can also serve as a luggage cart when partially unfolded. With additional attachments, it can function as a shopping cart or a stroller for children.

　　谭书臣发明全折叠自行车
    外出旅行能随身携带
    本报讯  记者任怀民报道：外出旅行、探亲，肩扛背驮手拎许多东西，去挤公共汽车真不方便。能否随身带着自行车外出，免受挤车之苦？北京军区后勤部老干部谭书臣经过两年半反复实践，发明全折叠多功能便携式自行车。
    谭书臣的设计是，通过车把折叠器、车身折叠器、脚蹬折叠器等关键部件的作用，把一辆普通自行车折叠成体积仅０．０８立方米的长方块。若用轻型钢制造的话，重量只有１０—１５公斤。它可自由折叠伸展，费时仅１分钟。由于体积小、重量轻，旅行、出差、探亲访友都可随身携带，以充交通工具。这种车半展开，还可作行李车，加上附件可当购货车、宝宝车。
