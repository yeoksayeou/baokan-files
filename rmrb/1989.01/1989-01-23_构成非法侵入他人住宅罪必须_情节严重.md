The crime of illegally entering another's residence refers to entering someone else's residence without the owner's permission, or entering and then refusing to leave after the owner has asked you to do so. According to Article 144 of the Criminal Law, "Those who illegally detain others, or illegally search the bodies or residences of others, or illegally enter the residences of others, shall be sentenced to fixed-term imprisonment of not more than three years or criminal detention." Since this article does not specify that illegal entry into another's residence must be "serious," some people might think that as long as the act of illegally entering another's residence is committed, it constitutes a crime. We believe this understanding is inappropriate. For example, if A and B have a trivial dispute and A enters B's residence to argue, and then leaves after being persuaded by others, A's act of entering the residence obviously does not constitute a crime. We know that any crime must have a certain degree of social harm. Social harm is the main characteristic of a crime, and any crime without social harm does not exist. Article 10 of the Criminal Law of our country stipulates that if the circumstances are obviously minor and the harm is not great, it is not considered a crime. This explains from the concept of crime that if the circumstances and harm do not reach a certain level, it should not be considered a crime. In addition, Article 131 of the Criminal Law stipulates: "The personal rights, democratic rights, and other rights of citizens shall be protected from illegal infringement by any person or any organization. Those who illegally infringe upon these rights in serious circumstances shall be subject to criminal penalties." This provision of the Criminal Law is a general provision for the crime of infringing upon the personal rights, democratic rights, and other rights of citizens, and its spirit applies to all provisions of the crime of infringing upon the personal rights, democratic rights, and other rights of citizens, including Article 144.

From this, it can be seen that illegal entry into another's residence must be "serious" to constitute a crime.

### 构成非法侵入他人住宅罪必须“情节严重”

　　构成非法侵入他人住宅罪必须“情节严重”
    非法侵入他人住宅罪，是指没有得到住宅主人允许而闯入他人住宅；或者闯入后经主人要求其退出而仍然无故不退出他人住宅的行为。根据刑法第１４４条规定：“非法管制他人，或者非法搜查他人身体、住宅，或者非法侵入他人住宅的，处三年以下有期徒刑或者拘役”。由于该条对非法侵入他人住宅没有规定要有“情节严重”这样的要件，有的同志会认为，只要实施了非法侵入他人住宅的行为，就构成犯罪。我们认为，这种认识是不妥的。如甲、乙两人因琐事发生纠纷，甲闯入乙住宅评理，经人劝解后，甲便退出乙的住宅。此案甲的侵入住宅行为，显然不构成犯罪。我们知道，任何犯罪都必须具有一定的社会危害性。社会危害性是犯罪的主要特征，任何离开社会危害性的犯罪是不存在的。我国刑法第１０条规定，情节显著轻微，危害不大的，不认为是犯罪，这就从犯罪的概念上说明了情节和危害达不到一定程度，不应当认为是犯罪。此外，刑法第１３１条规定：“保护公民的人身权利、民主权利和其他权利，不受任何人、任何机关非法侵犯。违法侵犯情节严重的，对直接责任人员予以刑事处分。”刑法的这条规定，是对侵犯公民人身权利、民主权利和其他权利罪的概括规定，其精神适用于侵犯公民人身权利、民主权利罪的全部条款，自然也包括其中的第１４４条。
    由此可见，非法侵入他人住宅必须“情节严重”，才构成犯罪。
