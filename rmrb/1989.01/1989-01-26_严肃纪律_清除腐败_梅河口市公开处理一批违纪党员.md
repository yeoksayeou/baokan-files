Upholding Discipline and Eliminating Corruption

Meihekou City Publicly Handles a Batch of Disciplinary Party Members

    The People's Daily reports: In early January, the Meihekou City Committee and the municipal government of Jilin Province held a meeting for a thousand cadres to publicly handle a batch of disciplinary party members.

    Wang Wei, the deputy section-level inspector of the Meihekou City Construction Commission, during his tenure as the Party Committee Secretary of Meihekou Town, the Party Committee Secretary of the Construction Bureau, and the Party Committee Secretary of the Meihekou City Area Work Committee, abused his power for personal gain. He acquired three houses totaling 331.81 square meters, with an average of 55.3 square meters per person, which is more than eight times the average residential area per capita in the city. Liu Youchen, the deputy secretary and mayor of Haidong Town, Meihekou City, during his tenure as the Party Committee Secretary of Niu Xinting Township, used his authority to seize collective property worth a total of 2,178 yuan through low pricing and coercion. Zheng Deli, a household registration police officer of the Newhe Town Public Security Bureau, Meihekou City, abused his power multiple times to help farmers who did not meet the conditions to change their status from agricultural to non-agricultural, and to alter the birthdates of young people who did not meet the marriage age requirements. He also collected bribes totaling 1,050 yuan. To promote clean governance in party and government agencies, the Meihekou City Discipline Inspection Commission and the Supervision Bureau, in addition to confiscating their illegal gains, gave them disciplinary warnings, demotions, expulsions from the party, and administrative demerits.
