Zhaozhou County Simplifies Administration and Reduces Staff to Save Costs

    Administrative Expenditures Decreased by Nearly 30% Last Year

    HOHHOT, Jan. 25 (Xinhua) -- How can poor counties get out of financial difficulties? Zhaozhou County in Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region has found a way through administrative simplification. By adhering to the principles of "reducing bureaucracy, decoupling, and establishing real entities," the county has streamlined its administrative personnel at the county level, thereby improving work efficiency and saving administrative expenses. This approach has sparked widespread thought among many poor counties across the nation.

    Zhaozhou County is a poor county located in the Yinshan Mountains of Inner Mongolia. Starting in 1986, the county, in conjunction with enterprise reforms, began to "slim down" its county-level administrative organs. It reduced the number of departments, sections, and bureaus in the five county-level administrative bodies by 2/5, decreased the number of administrative personnel by 40%, and reduced the number of department and bureau-level leaders by 25%. To achieve this, Zhaozhou County established the Bureau of Administrative Affairs, which unified the management of finance, document handling, vehicle maintenance, janitorial services, security, logistics, and other aspects for the five administrative bodies. This significantly reduced the number of redundant personnel in administrative organs. Previously, the five administrative bodies had 35 financial personnel, 29 document handlers, and 25 management personnel. Now, there are 11 financial personnel, 11 document handlers, and 2 management personnel.

    Zhaozhou County encourages the personnel who have been streamlined to decouple from administrative organs. There are four main paths: first, to strengthen enterprises; second, to start some development projects and tertiary industries; third, to attend school for further education; and fourth, to handle retirement procedures properly.

    For those who remain, positions and responsibilities are clearly defined, and performance indicators are set. As a result, the functions of administrative organs have changed, reducing the phenomenon of bureaucratic red tape and "multi-level consumption," thereby improving work efficiency and compressing administrative expenditures. In 1988, administrative expenses were reduced by 29% compared to before the personnel reduction.

　　卓资县简政裁员节省开支    
    去年行政费用减少近三成
    本报呼和浩特１月２５日电  记者傲腾报道：穷县如何摆脱财政困境？内蒙古自治区卓资县从简政中找到了出路。他们本着“消肿、脱钩、办实体”的原则，精简县级行政机关人员，既提高了工作效率，又节省了行政支出。这一做法引起全国很多穷县的思考。
    卓资县是内蒙古阴山山脉中的一个穷县。１９８６年开始，这个县结合企业改革对县级行政机构进行“消肿”，把县级五套行政机关原有的科、室、局精简了２／５，将原有的行政人员减少了４０％，科、局级领导减少了２５％。为此，卓资县成立了机关事务管理局，对县级五套班子的财务、文印收发、车辆、勤杂、保卫、后勤等实行统一管理，大大减少了行政机构的冗员。过去，五套班子共有财务人员３５名、文印收发２９人、管理人员２５人，现在财务１１人、文印收发１１人、管理人员２人。
    卓资县鼓励精简下来的人员与行政机关脱钩。一是充实企业；二是开办某些开发性项目和第三产业；三是进学校学习和补习文化；四是做好离退休工作。
    留下来的人员普遍实行了定岗定责，并订出了考核指标。因而行政机关职能有所转变，扯皮和“多环节消耗”现象大大减少，提高了工作效率，也压缩了行政开支。１９８８年的行政费用比减员前节约２９％。
