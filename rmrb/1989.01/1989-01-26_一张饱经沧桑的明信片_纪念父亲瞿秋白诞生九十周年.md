A Weathered Postcard
- In Memory of My Father, Qu Qiubai, on His 90th Birthday

On the eve of the 90th anniversary of Qu Qiubai's birth, I recall that 59 years ago, my father sent me a postcard.

It was August or September 1930. I was studying at the International Children's Home in the Soviet Union. One day, I suddenly received a letter from my parents, which included a postcard (see the image below): The front of the postcard featured a beautiful bunch of "forget-me-nots," with "Dúyī" written in Chinese on the lower left side. The back had a message in Russian: "For Dúyī. Mother. August 1, 1930. Crimea." It was signed by my mother, but both the Chinese and Russian text were in my father's handwriting.

At that time, my parents' return to China was kept secret, and they pretended to be working in Crimea. When they passed through Berlin, my father and Zhou Enlai participated in a demonstration by local unemployed workers. On August 1, my parents sent me the postcard from Berlin. I was only 9 years old then and only knew that the "forget-me-nots" were beautiful, not understanding their deeper meaning.

I eagerly awaited my parents' return to see me and play with me in the woods and meadows. I remember when I was six, my father and others held a meeting at a villa in the Moscow suburbs (I later learned it was the Sixth Party Congress). During breaks, my father would take me to the woods to play, collect wildflowers to make specimens, and enjoy the beauty of nature with me on the meadows.

My father came from a scholarly family and, combined with his natural talents and diligence, had a deep appreciation for the arts. He not only enjoyed singing and playing the xiao (a Chinese flute), but he was also skilled in poetry, painting, and seal carving.

Once, Marshal Nie said to me, "Your mother and father have a very deep bond; they even combined their names, do you know?" I knew. My father had carefully carved a seal: "Autumn's White Blossoms," symbolizing their deep love born from their arduous struggles.

The few letters my father sent me were secretly delivered through friends. Apart from that postcard, the rest have been lost. That the postcard has been preserved is quite remarkable! It was originally kept at the home of "Grandpa and Grandma" Baorui. When I grew up, they gave it to me to keep. In 1941, my mother took me back to China to Xinjiang. I heard that the warlord Sheng Shicai wanted to arrest communists, so my mother immediately moved some letters and documents to the Soviet Consulate in Di Hua (now Urumqi). Later, these items were returned to the International Children's Home in the Soviet Union. In the early days of New China, Comrade Li Peng, while studying in the Soviet Union, discovered these items and sent them back to my mother in China. Later, my mother handed over my father's manuscripts and calligraphy to the Central Archives. This postcard, however, was kept in my mother's album and not handed over. Because it did not have my father's name on it, it was not taken by the Red Guards during the Cultural Revolution but was kept in my mother's special case files. In 1973, my mother was imprisoned by the "Gang of Four" and died from persecution in October of that year. In 1980, after my father's name was rehabilitated, my mother's materials, including photographs and the postcard, were returned to me. This small postcard has endured nearly half a century of ups and downs and finally returned to its rightful owner, becoming the most precious memento my father left me.

　　一张饱经沧桑的明信片    
    ——纪念父亲瞿秋白诞生九十周年
    瞿独伊
    在瞿秋白诞生九十周年纪念日前夕，想到父亲５９年前给我寄过一张明信片。
    那是１９３０年８、９月份，我正在苏联国际儿童院学习，一天突然接到父母的来信，里面还夹着一张明信片（见右下图）：正面图案是一束美丽的“勿忘我”花，左下侧用中文写着“独伊”，背面用俄文写着：“送给独伊。妈妈。１９３０年８月１日。克里米亚。”署的是妈妈的名，而中俄文均是父亲的笔迹。
    当时父母回国很秘密，托称去克里米亚工作。他们途经柏林时，父亲和周恩来参加了当地失业工人的示威集会，８月１日那天，父母从柏林给我寄来了那张明信片。我当时才９岁，只知道“勿忘我”花好看，还不懂其深切的含义。
    我天天盼着父母能快些回来看我，陪我到树林草地上去游戏。记得我六岁那年，父亲他们在莫斯科郊外一座别墅里开会（后来才知道是开党的六大）。休息时，父亲就带我到树林里去玩，采集野花做标本，陪我在草地上游戏，欣赏大自然的美景。
    父亲出身书香门第，加上他的秉赋和用功，对文艺颇有造诣。他不仅爱好歌唱、吹箫，而且擅长写诗、画画、刻图章。
    有一次，聂帅对我说：“你妈妈和爸爸的感情可深哩，他们把自己的名字都连在一起了，你知道吗？”知道的。父亲曾精心刻过一枚图章：“秋之白华”，以此象征他们在艰苦斗争中产生的深厚爱情。
    父亲给我为数不多的信件也是通过友人秘密传递的。除了那张明信片，其余信件均已散失。而明信片能保存至今，可是不易！原先保存在鲍罗庭“爷爷奶奶”家，待我长大成人后，他们就交我自己保存了。１９４１年妈妈接我回国来到新疆，听说军阀盛世才要逮捕共产党人，妈妈立即把一些信函、文件转移到苏联驻迪化（今乌鲁木齐）的领事馆。后来，这些东西又辗转回到了苏联国际儿童院。新中国成立的初期，李鹏同志在苏联留学期间，发现了这批东西，随之转到国内我母亲手里。后来，母亲又把父亲的遗稿、手迹都上交给了中央档案馆，这张明信片却保存在妈妈的相册内，没有上交。因为上面没有父亲的名字，文革期间才未被红卫兵抄走，而是留在我母亲的专案组内。１９７３年母亲被“四人帮”关押，１９７３年１０月被迫害致死。１９８０年我父亲恢复名誉后，母亲的资料、照片包括那张明信片退还给我。小小的明信片经历了近半个世纪的风风雨雨，总算是物归原主了，成为父亲留给我的一件最珍贵的纪念品。
