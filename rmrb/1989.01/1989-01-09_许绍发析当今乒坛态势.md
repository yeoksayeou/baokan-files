Xu Shaofa, the head coach of the Chinese table tennis team, arrived in Singapore on the afternoon of the 7th with the players participating in the Asia-Europe table tennis competition from Malaysia. He told the local media: The Chinese team will strive for victory in the men's team event of the 40th World Table Tennis Championships in two months.

Xu Shaofa said that in the previous few World Championships, the Chinese men's team defeated the Swedish team with a significant advantage to win the title. However, the situation has changed now. The Swedish players have significantly improved, and the strength of both teams is now close. It is hard to predict who will win or lose. There is also a possibility that the Chinese team will lose the championship.

Regarding the Chinese team's lineup, Xu Shaofa said that the men's team still relies on veteran players, with Jiang Jialiang and Chen Longcan still being the mainstays. The new players in the Chinese team are not yet ready to bear the heavy responsibility of major competitions. Recently, the Chinese table tennis team sent two teams composed of new players to Europe to compete, but the results were not ideal.

As for the Chinese women's team, Xu Shaofa said that the new players have matured and can replace the positions of the old team members, and the situation is relatively ideal.

When talking about the recent development of table tennis in Asia and Europe, Xu Shaofa said that European new players are growing rapidly and have new playing styles. Some weaker teams are catching up with the stronger teams in terms of level. However, Asia is slightly behind in this regard.

After the Chinese men's team's failure in the Olympics, some people believe that the Chinese team must develop the two-sided attack style to regain the advantage. Regarding this, Xu Shaofa said that using the two-sided attack style from the past, such as that used by Zhuang Zedong, may not be successful now. The current style requires not only a few quick attacks but also the ability to play prolonged rallies.

The first round of the Asia-Europe competition was held in Malaysia. The Asian team, consisting of Jiang Jialiang, Teng Yi, and Kim Ki-seok, lost 2-5 to the European team. When asked about the reasons for the Asian team's defeat, Xu Shaofa explained that the humid air in Malaysia is not conducive to players using positive rubber, as Jiang Jialiang, Chen Longcan, Teng Yi, Kim Ki-seok, and Li Huifen all use positive rubber and were affected. The humid air causes the rubber to slip, and the ball drops when the players pull it. However, European players all use reverse rubber, and the humid air does not affect them much. Their topspin and quick attack techniques were well executed.

　　许绍发析当今乒坛态势
    中国乒乓球队总教练许绍发７日下午随参加亚欧乒乓球对抗赛的选手们从马来西亚抵达新加坡。他向当地新闻界表示：中国队将在两个月后举行的第４０届世界乒乓球锦标赛男子团体赛中，全力争取胜利。
    许绍发说，前几届世界锦标赛，中国男队皆以较大优势击败瑞典队夺魁。但是，现在情况发生变化，瑞典球员水平大有提高，双方实力接近，谁胜谁负很难预料。中国队丢掉桂冠的可能性也是有的。
    谈到中国队的阵容，许绍发说男队还是以老将为主，江嘉良与陈龙灿仍是队中主力。中国队新人尚肩负不了大赛的重任。最近中国乒乓球队派两支由新人组成的队伍到欧洲比赛，成绩都不理想。
    至于中国女队，许绍发说，新人已成熟，可以接替老队员的位置，情况比较理想。
    在谈到亚欧乒乓球最近的发展时，许绍发说，欧洲新人成长很快，并有新的打法，一些弱队与强队水平越来越接近。而亚洲在这方面稍差一些。
    中国男队在奥运会失利后，有人认为中国队要挽回劣势，必须发展两面攻打法。对此，许绍发表示，现在采用当年庄则栋的两面攻打法未必能取得成功。现在的打法，只会抢攻几板不行，还要能打相持球。
    亚欧对抗赛首轮在马来西亚举行，由江嘉良、滕毅与金琦泽组成的亚洲一队以２∶５负于欧洲一队。当问起亚洲队失利原因时，许绍发解释说，马来西亚空气潮湿，不利于正胶打法的球员，江嘉良、陈龙灿、滕毅、金琦泽与李惠芬都是打正胶，受到影响。潮湿的空气使胶粒滑，球员拉球时球总向下掉。而欧洲球员都用反胶，潮湿空气对他们影响不大，他们的弧圈快攻技术发挥很好。
