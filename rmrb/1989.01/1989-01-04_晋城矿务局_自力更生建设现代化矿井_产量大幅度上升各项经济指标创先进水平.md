Jincheng Mining Bureau Self-Reliantly Builds Modern Mines, Production and Economic Indicators Reach Advanced Levels

Xinhua News Agency reporter Liu Xiaoyang reports: The Jincheng Mining Bureau in Shanxi Province has self-reliantly built modern mines, transforming a backward mining bureau into a first-class enterprise.

The Jincheng Mining Bureau began construction in 1958. From its establishment to 1978, it never reached its designed capacity. In recent years, the entire mining bureau has undergone tremendous changes: raw coal production has significantly increased. In 1983, 500.1 million tons of raw coal were produced, and last year this reached 1,000 million tons. Over five years, the average annual increase was more than 160 million tons, equivalent to 2.38 times the original designed capacity, and economic benefits have significantly improved. Last year, 70 million yuan in profits and taxes were turned over. Labor productivity increased from 1.87 tons per worker to 4.2 tons per worker, which is four times the national average.

Safety indicators have entered the world's advanced ranks. Their main experiences are:

	— Self-reliantly building modern mines. Since 1983, they have raised 700 million yuan and borrowed 180 million yuan from banks, determined to use advanced equipment to transform backward coal mining methods. Now, the entire bureau has formed a comprehensive mining, comprehensive excavation, and high-level coordinated combat production framework, fully realizing mechanized coal mining.

	— Strict management, meticulous attention to detail. They have formulated a series of management and technical standards, established and improved various rules and regulations and inspection and acceptance methods. In 1987, the Coal Industry Department named Jincheng Mining Bureau and its three affiliated mines as first-class standard mines, with a 100% qualification rate for first-class mines, taking the lead nationwide.

	— Deepening reforms, daring to innovate. In terms of management mechanisms, they have implemented a "step pricing" settlement system (based on the national plan base number to formulate four steps) in response to new situations and problems arising from the implementation of the total wage contract for per-ton coal. This encourages each mine to climb steps and steep slopes, earning the price of the step they reach.

Since 1985, this bureau has won 152 honorary titles. In March last year, it was named the "Modern Mining Bureau of China" by the Coal Industry Department, won the National May 1st Medal, and was approved as a "National Second-Class Enterprise."

　　晋城矿务局　自力更生建设现代化矿井
    产量大幅度上升各项经济指标创先进水平
    本报讯  记者刘燮阳报道：山西晋城矿务局自力更生建设现代化矿井，使一个落后的矿务局成为第一流的企业。
    晋城矿务局是１９５８年开始筹建的，从建局到１９７８年２０年间，从未达到设计能力。近几年来，整个矿务局发生了巨大的变化：原煤产量大幅度提高。１９８３年生产原煤５００．１万吨，去年达到１０００万吨。５年间，平均每年递增１６０万吨以上，相当于原设计能力２．３８倍，经济效益显著上升。去年已经上交利税７０００万元。全员效率由１．８７吨／工提高到４．２吨／工，是全国平均水平的４倍。
    安全指标跻入世界先进行列。他们的主要经验是：
    ——自力更生建设现代化矿井。１９８３年以来，他们自筹资金７０００多万元，同时向银行贷款１８００万元，下决心用先进的设备改造落后的采煤手段。现在，全局形成了综采、综掘、高档协同作战的采掘生产主体框架，全部实现了采煤机械化。
    ——严格管理，一丝不苟。他们制定了一系列的管理标准和技术标准，建立和健全了各项规章制度和检查验收办法。１９８７年煤炭部首批命名晋城矿务局和所属的３个矿为质量标准化特级矿井，特级矿井达标率１００％，一举在全国夺魁。
    ——深化改革，敢于创新。在经营机制上，他们针对实行吨煤工资总承包经营后出现的新情况、新问题，实行“台阶单价”（以国家计划基数制定出四个台阶）结算制。激励各矿爬台阶，上陡坡，上到哪个台阶，拿哪个台阶的单价。
    １９８５年以来，这个局共荣获荣誉称号１５２项，去年３月，被煤炭部命名为“中国现代化矿务局”，荣获全国五一奖状，并被批准为“国家二级企业”。
