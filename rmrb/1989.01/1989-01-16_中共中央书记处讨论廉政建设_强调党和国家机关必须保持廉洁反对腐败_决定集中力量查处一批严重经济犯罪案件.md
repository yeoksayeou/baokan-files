The Central Secretariat of the Communist Party of China held a meeting on December 30, 1988, under the chairmanship of General Secretary Zhao Ziyang, to discuss the issue of maintaining the integrity of Party and state organs in the new situation.

Hu Qili, Qiao Shi, Song Ping, Rui Xianwen, Yan Mingfu, and Wen Jiabao attended the meeting. Responsible comrades from the Central Commission for Discipline Inspection, the General Office of the Central Committee, the Organization Department, the Propaganda Department, the Central Research Office for Political System Reform, the Central Committee's Work Committee for Directly Affiliated Institutions, the Central Committee's Work Committee for State Organs, the Party Committee of the Supreme People's Procuratorate, and the Party Committee of the Supervision Department were present.

The following is the full text of the meeting minutes:

	I. Correctly Understand the Current Situation of Integrity in Party and State Organs

Our Party is a party that serves the people wholeheartedly, and our government is a clean government. The vast majority of Party members and cadres in Party and state organs are honest, law-abiding, and self-disciplined, and they have withstood the test of reform and opening up. Over the past decade, the great achievements we have made in implementing the line of the Third Plenary Session of the Eleventh Central Committee are inseparable from the selfless dedication and hard work of the broad masses of Party members and cadres. If we do not adhere to the facts and boldly affirm this mainstream, we will not be able to correctly understand the current situation of Party and state organs, which will dampen the enthusiasm of the broad masses of cadres and be detrimental to the construction of integrity. At the same time, we must be soberly aware that in the conditions of reform and opening up and the activation of the economy, there are indeed a few people in Party and state organs who cannot withstand the test, accept bribes, embezzle public funds, and abuse power to extort. Although these corrupt behaviors occur in a few individuals, they tarnish the image of Party and state organs in the eyes of the people, damage the reputation of reform and opening up, directly harm the interests of the state and the people, and interfere with and hinder the smooth progress of modernization construction. We must attach great importance to this and take strong measures to solve it, and we must not allow it to develop and erode our healthy body.

In the stage where commodity economy is beginning to become active, but administrative behavior, market behavior, and enterprise behavior have not yet been strictly regulated by legal means, it is easiest for power-for-money exchange and other corrupt behaviors to breed and spread. Our country is in the stage of developing socialist commodity economy, and the transition of the new and old systems in the reform process has not been completed, and the new order of socialist commodity economy is yet to be established. Under these circumstances, this kind of problem will also be more prominent. However, we are a socialist country under the leadership of the Communist Party, and we must not allow the breeding and spread of corruption. As long as we fully play the role of the Party, especially strengthen and improve ideological and political work, carry forward the fine tradition of wholeheartedly serving the people, working hard, and being clean and upright that the Party has formed in the long-term revolutionary struggle; as long as we fully play the superiority of the socialist system, especially rely on the construction of socialist democracy and the rule of law; as long as we firmly believe in the people, especially rely on the supervision of the people over Party and state organs and their staff, we can completely maintain integrity while prospering the economy. All Party comrades should have full confidence in this.

	II. Treat the Construction of Integrity as a Major Task

The Central Committee has long emphasized that: reform and opening up, prosperity of the economy, must be unwavering; maintaining integrity, opposing corruption, must also be unwavering. This is our basic policy. Without reform and opening up, it is difficult to develop social productivity, and it is impossible to fundamentally maintain the integrity of Party and state organs; without the construction of integrity, allowing corruption to breed and spread, it is difficult to guarantee the socialist direction, and reform and opening up will also be difficult to proceed smoothly.

In the past year, especially since the Third Plenary Session of the Thirteenth Central Committee, various levels of Party committees and governments have taken some anti-corruption measures in conjunction with the rectification and regulation of the economic field and have achieved results. However, the work of integrity is still far from sufficient, and some corrupt behaviors have not been effectively curbed. Maintaining the integrity of Party and state organs remains an urgent task for the Party and the government. Party organizations at all levels, regions, departments, and units must place the construction of integrity as an important task to ensure reform and opening up on the agenda. The main leaders of the Party committees should take the lead, make arrangements in conjunction with their actual situations, and establish a clear responsibility system, strengthen inspection and supervision, and effectively implement it.

At present, the timing for carrying out the construction of integrity is favorable. The spirit of the Thirteenth Central Committee's Third Plenary Session on strengthening ideological and political work, strengthening Party building, and giving full play to our political advantages is being implemented. The rectification of the economic environment and the regulation of the economic order have provided favorable conditions and new requirements for doing this work. The ongoing financial, tax, and price inspections and the rectification and regulation of various types of companies have provided important clues for the investigation and handling of bribery and embezzlement cases. The deterrence of the law and the appeal of the policy are playing a role. The pilot work of integrity system construction in various places has accumulated some fresh experience. Various levels of Party committees should continue to conscientiously implement the spirit of the Thirteenth Central Committee's Third Plenary Session, and in the rectification and regulation, focus on the construction of integrity, and at the same time, through the construction of integrity, promote the rectification and regulation work, and closely combine the construction of integrity with the rectification and regulation. As long as we attach importance to ideology, take effective measures, and work hard, we will be able to achieve more obvious results in both maintaining integrity and rectification and regulation.

	III. Comprehensive Governance, Emphasizing Key Areas

Under the conditions of reform and opening up and the development of commodity economy, how to enable Party organizations and the broad masses of Party members to effectively resist and overcome various forms of corruption and withstand severe tests is a major issue that Party building in the new period must solve. The general idea to solve this problem is to adhere to the "two-handed" policy that our Party has repeatedly emphasized, that is, one hand to grasp reform and opening up and economic construction, and one hand to grasp work in the political and ideological fields. We must promote economic system reform and political system reform, strengthen institutional construction and legal construction, and establish a new order of socialist commodity economy; through strengthening Party building, carrying out in-depth ideological and political work, enhancing the self-awareness of various levels of Party organizations and the broad masses of Party members to maintain integrity, and fundamentally prevent and overcome the occurrence of corruption. We must proceed along this correct path.

Maintaining integrity and opposing corruption must be comprehensively governed. Comprehensive governance means using legal, administrative, institutional, disciplinary, and educational means, with five-pronged efforts and mutual supplementation; it means that the work of investigating and dealing with serious cases, focusing on institutional construction, improving the supervision mechanism, strictly managing the Party, and strengthening ideological education should be carried out simultaneously and in coordination. According to the experience of various places in carrying out anti-corruption work, it is necessary to focus on the investigation and handling of major cases and the construction of integrity systems at present.

The bribery and embezzlement of Party and state organs' staff are particularly harmful to the development of socialist commodity economy. Therefore, cracking down on bribery and embezzlement is a problem that must be emphasized in the current anti-corruption work. At the same time, illegal speculation for huge profits, using public funds and public property to build private houses, abusing power to extort, and other illegal and disciplinary behaviors, as well as behaviors that cause great public dissatisfaction such as using power for personal gain and extravagant waste, must also be seriously investigated and resolved.

	IV. Concentrate Forces to Investigate and Deal with a Batch of Serious Economic Crime Cases

At present, it is necessary to concentrate forces to investigate and deal with a batch of serious economic crime cases such as bribery and embezzlement, and severely punish a batch of criminals who have aroused great public indignation. Doing so can boost the confidence and courage of the broad masses of cadres and the people to fight against various illegal and disciplinary behaviors and promote the overall development of anti-corruption work.

Investigating and dealing with economic crime cases must rely on the masses. The eyes of the masses are sharp, and no matter how concealed and cunning the criminals are, they cannot escape the supervision of the masses. We must treat the masses' accusations and exposures seriously. For relatively important clues, we must grasp them and investigate them to the end.

Investigating and dealing with economic crime cases must fully rely on supervisory and procuratorial organs at all levels. The Party's disciplinary inspection organs and departments such as industry and commerce, auditing, and taxation must cooperate closely. At present, the task of investigating cases is heavy, and if the professional team is insufficient, it should be adjusted and strengthened in a timely manner. We must study the characteristics of criminals' crimes in the new situation and take necessary measures. In terms of filing cases, investigation, and evidence collection, we must summarize our own experience, learn from effective practices abroad, and continuously improve the level of case handling and case-solving efficiency. At the same time, we must speed up the improvement of legislation to punish bribery and embezzlement.

In investigating and dealing with economic crime cases, the Party leadership organs at all levels and departments must play a guiding and coordinating role. For matters that cannot be solved by a single department in terms of organizing personnel, providing funds, and creating other working conditions, the Party and government leadership organs should step in and make overall arrangements.

	V. Strengthen Institutional Construction

While seriously investigating and dealing with cases, we must pay great attention to and focus on the construction of integrity systems to plug loopholes, improve management, establish order, and reduce and even eliminate the soil for the breeding of corruption. Publicizing work and accepting public complaints are two important institutional constructions in maintaining the integrity of Party and state organs since the Thirteenth National Congress. We must summarize the experience and promote it.

Establishing systems and publicizing work can eliminate the arbitrariness of staff and ensure that anyone who handles matters does so in the same way. Various departments, especially those in charge of law enforcement and approval, and public utility units, should, on the basis of summarizing the experience since the founding of the nation, absorb new experience from the reform, and establish and improve a complete set of clear and specific approval and work systems. This is a basic work that must be done urgently. At present, we should start from the departments that directly deal with residents and enterprises, from the links that the masses are most concerned about and most prone to fraud, and from the problems that are relatively easy to solve, and gradually extend and improve. The rules, procedures, results, and deadlines for serving the masses should be announced to the masses. Matters that should be handled should not be delayed or refused, and matters that should not be handled should not be handled privately. Doing so is not only conducive to improving efficiency but also to maintaining integrity. If we follow this path, we will create a new situation in the openness of government affairs, democratic supervision, and even the entire construction of socialist democracy.

Establishing a complaint center is an effective form of relying on the masses to expose corruption without launching a mass movement, and it is also an important part of the construction of the people's supervision system. It is necessary for supervisory and procuratorial organs at the county level and above nationwide to set up complaint centers, which should be done in earnest and not be formalistic. The complaints of the masses should be investigated and dealt with seriously, and feedback should be given in a timely manner. Those who expose corruption should be commended and protected, and appropriate rewards should be given. Those who retaliate against informants and use complaints to frame others should be investigated and dealt with according to law.

	VI. Establish and Improve the Supervision System

Establishing and improving the supervision system and strengthening the supervision and restraint of Party and state organs' Party members and cadres are of special importance for maintaining integrity and preventing the breeding of corruption. The departments of discipline inspection, supervision, and procuratorate should, in the process of fighting against corruption and playing a supervisory role, not only fully play their respective functions, strictly enforce laws, disciplines, and Party disciplines, but also strengthen coordination and cooperation among themselves.

The departments of discipline inspection, supervision, and procuratorate should strengthen their own construction, continuously improve the quality of their personnel, and improve regulations. Supervisory departments should also accept supervision. Communist Party members working in these departments should not betray the trust of the people, act impartially, and fearlessly fight against various acts of favoritism, bribery, and lawlessness.

The broad masses of Party disciplinary inspection cadres are an important force in fighting against various disciplinary violations within the Party. Various levels of Party committees should strengthen the leadership of disciplinary inspection work and make this force fully play its role in performing the duties of internal inspection and supervision within the Party.

	VII. Public Opinion Supervision

Using newspapers, television, and radio to publicize the rule of law and promote social justice, and to expose the illegal and disciplinary behaviors of Party and state organs' staff, is an effective form of public opinion supervision. The key is to use this means well. News reports should pay special attention to facts, laws, and policies, and maintain a sense of proportion when exposing corruption. Before the case is closed, news reports should not arbitrarily give the defendant a guilty verdict. For all major problems that are publicly exposed, the handling results must be publicly explained. If the report is seriously inaccurate, it should be publicly corrected.

News reports should especially focus on promoting good examples and good experiences in the construction of integrity. This is very useful for boosting people's confidence, exchanging experiences, and promoting the deepening of the construction of integrity. In recent years, various regions, departments, and units have had a number of good Party members and cadres who have maintained integrity under the conditions of reform and opening up, and some regions, departments, and units have also created valuable experiences in maintaining integrity and rectifying corruption. Previously, these deeds and experiences were not sufficiently publicized, and in the future, they should be strengthened.

	VIII. Give Full Play to the Supervision Role of Democratic Parties and Mass Organizations

The supervision role of democratic parties, non-partisan patriots, and mass organizations in national political life should be fully brought into play. In accordance with the regulations on the management of cadres and legal procedures, qualified democratic party members and non-partisan individuals should be appointed to leading positions in supervisory departments at all levels. Conditions and convenience should be provided for mass organizations to play a supervisory role in their respective regions and units.

Party committees and governments at all levels should often listen to the opinions and suggestions of democratic parties, non-partisan patriots, and mass organizations on the construction of integrity. They should be invited to participate in the investigation and handling of economic cases and other related cases. Their reports on the non-integrity behavior of Party and state organs and their staff should be investigated and dealt with seriously by supervisory and judicial organs.

	IX. Strictly Govern the Party

The construction of the ruling party itself has a crucial impact on maintaining the integrity of Party and state organs. Among the cadres serving in government agencies at all levels across the country, Party members account for the majority. If the broad masses of Party members, especially Party cadres, govern cleanly, it will fundamentally ensure the integrity of Party and state organs. Therefore, we must strengthen the education of Party members and incorporate anti-corruption into construction and reform, and strictly govern the Party.

At present, special attention should be paid to two aspects. First, the cadre aspect. The condition of being clean and upright should be highlighted as an important criterion for recommending, investigating, and appointing cadres, and those who are not clean and upright should not be promoted and trusted. Second, the aspect of Party discipline. Party members with non-integrity behavior should be seriously dealt with in accordance with Party discipline, up to and including expulsion from the Party. Those who violate the law should be punished according to law in addition to being disciplined by the Party.

In the work of integrity, various levels of Party organizations should fully play their due leadership role, supervisory role, and role as a fighting fortress. Party leading cadres must set an example, be selfless and dedicated, and voluntarily accept the supervision of Party members and the masses, and set an example of maintaining integrity. All Communist Party members must consciously abide by Party discipline and play a vanguard and exemplary role in the construction of integrity. The Party committee of the organ should regard the maintenance of integrity as an important task in the construction of the organ and do it well. It should combine the education of the situation, the democratic evaluation of Party members, and the democratic assessment of leading cadres, and often educate the broad masses of Party members and cadres on being clean and upright and abiding by laws and disciplines, and enhance their awareness of maintaining integrity.

　　中共中央书记处讨论廉政建设
    强调党和国家机关必须保持廉洁反对腐败
    决定集中力量查处一批严重经济犯罪案件
    新华社北京１月１５日电  赵紫阳总书记于１９８８年１２月３０日主持召开中共中央书记处会议，就党和国家机关在新形势下保持廉洁的问题进行了讨论。
    胡启立、乔石、宋平、芮杏文、阎明复、温家宝同志出席了会议。中共中央纪律检查委员会、中共中央办公厅、中共中央组织部、中共中央宣传部、中央政治体制改革研究室、中共中央直属机关工委、中央国家机关工委、最高人民检察院党组、监察部党组的负责同志列席了会议。
    会议纪要全文如下：
    　　　　一、正确认识当前党和国家机关的廉洁状况
    我们的党是全心全意为人民服务的党，我们的政府是廉洁的政府。党和国家机关的绝大多数党员、干部，是奉公守法、廉洁自律的，是经得起改革开放考验的。十年来，我们贯彻十一届三中全会以来的路线所取得的伟大成绩，是同广大党员、干部的克己奉公、艰苦奋斗分不开的。如果不实事求是、理直气壮地肯定这个主流，就不能正确认识当前党和国家机关的状况，就会挫伤广大干部的积极性，不利于廉政建设。
    同时必须清醒地看到，在改革开放、搞活经济的条件下，党和国家机关中确有少数人经不起考验，受贿贪污，弄权勒索。这种腐败行为尽管发生在少数人身上，但它玷污党和国家机关在人民群众中的形象，败坏改革开放的声誉，直接损害国家和群众的利益，干扰、阻碍现代化建设的顺利进行。对此，我们必须高度重视并采取强有力措施加以解决，绝不能任其发展，侵蚀我们的健康肌体。
    在商品经济开始趋于活跃，而行政行为、市场行为和企业行为尚未通过法制形式严密规范的时候，权力和金钱交换等腐败行为最容易滋生蔓延。我国正处在发展社会主义商品经济的阶段，改革过程中的新旧体制交替尚未完成，社会主义商品经济新秩序有待确立。在这种情况下，这类问题的发生也会比较突出。但是，我们是共产党领导下的社会主义国家，绝不能允许腐败现象的滋生和蔓延。只要充分发挥党的作用，特别是加强和改进思想政治工作，发扬党在长期革命斗争中形成的全心全意为人民服务、艰苦奋斗、廉洁奉公的优良传统；只要充分发挥社会主义制度的优越性，特别是依靠社会主义民主和法制的建设；只要坚定地相信人民群众，特别是依靠群众对党和国家机关及其工作人员的监督，我们完全能够在繁荣经济的同时保持廉洁。全党同志对此要有充分的信心。
    　　　　二、把廉政建设作为一件大事来抓
    中央早就强调指出：改革开放，繁荣经济，要坚定不移；保持廉洁，反对腐败，也要坚定不移。这是我们的基本方针。不改革开放，社会生产力就很难发展，也就不可能从根本上保持党和国家机关的廉洁；不进行廉政建设，任凭腐败现象滋生蔓延，社会主义方向就难以保证，改革开放也难以顺利进行。
    近一年来，特别是十三届三中全会以来，各级党委和政府结合经济领域的治理、整顿，采取了一些廉政措施并取得了成效。但是，廉政工作做得还很不够，某些腐败行为尚未得到有力的遏制。保持党和国家机关的廉洁仍然是党和政府面临的一项紧迫任务。各地区、各部门、各单位的党组织，必须把廉政建设作为保证改革开放的一项重要任务摆上议事日程。党委主要领导要亲自动手，结合各自的实际情况，作出部署。要建立明确的责任制，加强检查监督，切实抓出成效。
    当前，开展廉政建设的时机是有利的。党的十三届三中全会关于加强思想政治工作、加强党的建设、发挥我们的政治优势的精神，正在得到贯彻。治理经济环境、整顿经济秩序，为做好这项工作提供了有利条件，也提出了新的要求。正在进行的财务、税收、物价检查和对各类公司的清理整顿，各级举报中心的建立和开展工作，都为查处受贿贪污案件提供了重要线索。法律的震慑和政策的感召正在发挥作用。各地进行的廉政制度建设试点工作，积累了一些新鲜经验。各级党委要继续认真贯彻党的十三届三中全会精神，在治理、整顿中抓紧廉政建设，同时通过加强廉政建设推动治理、整顿工作，把廉政建设同治理、整顿紧密结合起来。只要思想重视，措施有力，扎实工作，我们就能在保持廉洁和治理整顿两个方面取得更为明显的成效。
    　　　　三、综合治理，突出重点
    在改革开放和发展商品经济的条件下，如何使党组织和广大党员有效地抵御和战胜各种腐蚀，经受住严峻的考验，这是新时期党的建设必须解决的重大课题。解决这个课题总的思路，是坚持我们党一再强调的“两手抓”的方针，即一手抓改革开放和经济建设，一手抓政治和思想领域的工作。要通过推进经济体制改革和政治体制改革，加强制度建设和法制建设，建立社会主义商品经济新秩序；通过加强党的建设，深入进行思想政治工作，增强各级党组织和广大党员保持廉洁的自觉性，从根本上防止和克服腐败现象的发生。我们必须沿着这个正确的思路前进。
    保持廉洁、反对腐败，必须综合治理。所谓综合治理，就是要运用法律的、行政的、制度的、纪律的、教育的手段，五管齐下，互相补充；就是要使查处危害严重的案件、抓紧制度建设、完善监督机制、从严治党和加强思想教育等项工作相互配合，同时进行。根据各地开展廉政工作的经验，当前有必要突出抓好重大案件的查处和廉政制度的建设。
    党和国家机关工作人员的索贿、受贿、贪污行为，对发展社会主义商品经济危害特别严重。因此，打击受贿贪污是当前廉政工作中必须着重解决的问题。同时，对非法倒卖牟取暴利，利用公款公物营造私房，弄权勒索等违法违纪行为，以及群众意见很大的以权谋私、挥霍浪费等行为，也必须严肃查处和认真解决。
    　　　　四、集中力量查处一批危害严重的经济犯罪案件
    当前，必须集中力量查处一批危害严重的受贿贪污等经济犯罪案件，严惩一批民愤很大的犯罪分子。这样做，能够鼓舞广大干部、群众同各种违法违纪行为作斗争的信心和勇气，推动整个廉政工作的开展。
    查处经济犯罪案件，要很好地依靠群众。群众的眼睛是雪亮的，犯罪分子再隐蔽、再狡猾，也逃不过群众的监督。对群众的检举揭发，我们要严肃认真地对待。凡属比较重要的线索，一定要抓住不放，追查到底。
    查处经济犯罪案件，要充分依靠各级监察和检察部门，党的纪检部门和工商、审计、税收等部门要大力协同配合。当前查处案件任务繁重，专业队伍力量不足的，应及时加以调整充实。要注意研究犯罪分子在新形势下作案的特点，并采取必要的手段。在立案侦破、调查取证等方面，要总结我们自己的经验，借鉴国外行之有效的做法，不断提高办案水平和破案效率。同时，要抓紧完善惩治受贿贪污的立法工作。
    各地方、各部门党的领导机关，在查处经济犯罪案件中要注意发挥指导和协调的作用。在组织人员、提供经费和创造其它工作条件方面，单靠一个部门无法解决的，应由党政领导机关出面，统筹安排。
    　　　　五、加强制度建设
    在严肃查处案件的同时，必须十分重视和抓紧廉政制度的建设，以堵塞漏洞，完善管理，建立秩序，减少乃至消除滋生腐败现象的土壤。办事公开和群众举报，是党的十三大以来在保持党和国家机关廉洁方面的两项重要制度建设。要认真总结经验，加以推广。
    建立制度，办事公开，切实抓好这两条，就能消除工作人员的随意性，从制度上保证谁办事都一样。各部门特别是掌握执法、审批等权力的部门和公用事业单位，要在总结建国以来经验的基础上，吸取改革中的新经验，建立和健全一整套明确具体的审批和办事制度。这是一项基础性的工作，必须抓紧做好。当前，应从直接与居民和企业打交道的部门开始，从群众最关心和最容易舞弊的环节抓起，从比较容易解决的问题着手，逐步延伸和完善。为群众办事的规章、程序、结果和期限，应向群众公布。该办的不得刁难不办，不该办的不能徇私舞弊。这样做，既有利于提高效率，又有利于保持廉洁。我们沿着这条路子走下去，将在政务公开、民主监督乃至整个社会主义民主建设方面，开创新的局面。
    设立举报中心，是在不搞群众运动的情况下，依靠群众揭露腐败现象的有效形式，也是人民监督制度建设的一项重要内容。全国县以上监察和检察部门普遍设立举报中心，很有必要，应切实做好，不要流于形式。对群众的举报，要认真查处，适时反馈。要表彰和保护举报有功人员，并酌情予以奖励。对打击报复举报人和利用举报诬陷他人的，要依法查处。
    　　　　六、建立和完善监督体系
    建立和完善监督体系，加强对党和国家机关党员、干部的监督和制约，对于保持廉洁、防止腐败现象的滋生，具有特别重要的意义。纪检、监察、检察等部门，在同腐败行为作斗争和发挥监督作用的过程中，既应充分发挥各自的职能，严格执行法律、政纪和党纪，又应加强相互之间的协调和配合。
    纪检、监察、检察等部门，要加强自身建设，不断提高人员素质，完善法规。监督部门也应接受监督。在这些部门工作的共产党员，要不负人民的重托，秉公办事，无私无畏地同各种徇私舞弊、贪赃枉法的行为作斗争。
    广大党的纪检干部，是同党内各种违纪行为作斗争的一支重要力量。各级党委要对纪检工作加强领导，使这支队伍在履行党内检查、监督的职责方面充分发挥作用。
    　　　　七、舆论监督
    利用报刊、电视、广播来宣传法制和弘扬社会正气，揭露党和国家机关工作人员的违法违纪行为，是一种行之有效的舆论监督。关键是运用好这种手段。新闻报道在揭露腐败现象时，必须注意事实准确，依据法律和政策，把握分寸。结案处理前，新闻报道不得随便给当事人肯定罪名。对所有公开揭露的重大问题，都必须公开交待处理结果。如果报道严重失实，要公开更正。
    新闻报道要特别重视宣传廉政建设中的好典型、好经验。这对提高人们的信心，交流经验，推动廉政建设的深入，很有作用。近几年来，各地区、各部门、各单位都有一批在改革开放条件下保持廉洁的好党员、好干部，一些地区、部门和单位在保持廉洁、整治腐败现象方面也创造了宝贵经验。前一段，对这些事迹和经验宣传不够，今后应大力加强。
    　　　　八、发挥民主党派和群众团体的监督作用
    要充分发挥民主党派、无党派爱国人士和群众团体在国家政治生活中的民主监督作用。要按照干部管理规定和法律程序，吸收符合条件的民主党派和无党派人士担任各级监察部门的领导职务。要为群众团体在所在地区和单位发挥监督作用提供条件和方便。
    各级党委和政府应经常听取民主党派、无党派爱国人士和群众团体对廉政建设的意见和建议。要吸收他们参加经济案件和其它有关案件的查处工作。他们对党和国家机关及其工作人员不廉洁行为的举报，监督和司法机关应认真查处。
    　　　　九、从严治党
    执政党的自身建设对保持党和国家机关的廉洁具有举足轻重的影响。在全国各级政府机关任职的干部中，党员占大多数。广大党员特别是党员干部为政清廉，就能从根本上保证党和国家机关的廉洁。因此，一定要加强对党员的教育，把反腐蚀寓于建设和改革之中，从严治党。
    当前，要特别注意把好两关。一是把好干部关。要把廉洁奉公这一条突出出来，作为推荐、考察、任用干部的重要条件，绝不能提拔和信用那些不廉洁的干部。二是把好党纪关。对有不廉洁行为的党员，应按党纪严肃处理，直至开除党籍。对触犯刑律的除给予党纪处理以外，还必须依法惩处。
    各级党组织在廉政工作中要充分发挥应有的领导作用、监督作用和战斗堡垒作用。党员领导干部一定要以身作则，克己奉公，自觉接受党员和群众的监督，做保持廉洁的表率。一切共产党员都要自觉遵守党的纪律，在廉政建设中发挥先锋模范作用。机关党委要把保持廉洁作为机关建设的一项重要工作抓紧抓好。要结合形势教育、民主评议党员和民主考核领导干部，经常对广大党员、干部进行廉洁奉公和遵纪守法的教育，增强保持廉洁的自觉性。
