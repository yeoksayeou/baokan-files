	Warmth in Humanity
	—A Review of the TV Series "Yellow River Flows East"
	Guo Qing

	In the depths of winter, the airwaves bring a whiff of the earthy fragrance from the central plains. The eleven-episode TV series "Yellow River Flows East" artistically depicts the hardships of the people of the Yellow River region in the late 1930s. On the screen, characters come to life with believable stories of joy and sorrow, and each scene is rich with meaning, emphasizing the bonds of hometown, friendship, and familial love, all infused with a strong "Henan flavor"!

	"Yellow River Flows East" is adapted from the novel of the same name, which won the second Mao Dun Literature Prize. Generally, adapting a classic literary work into a film or TV series can be challenging. Even though a TV series has more room for content, it is still difficult to fully capture the essence of the original novel. Apart from the numerous characters and complex plotlines, the detailed psychological and scenic descriptions unique to literature are often hard to translate into visual and emotional images on screen.

	The adaptation of "Yellow River Flows East" is largely successful. The screenwriter Li Che has a deep understanding of the original novel, making appropriate changes and selections. The author of the original novel, Li Zhun, watched the TV series and was satisfied, saying, "The adaptation captures the essence of my work!" The adapters chose three families from the original novel and portrayed them vividly. It is the fate of these lifelike characters that stir the emotions of the audience and provoke deep reflection.

	Director Kang Zheng, who turned to directing later in life, has remained steadfast in his pursuit of realistic creation over the years. He has not been swayed by trends or imitations but has focused on portraying characters and their development. His handling of the main characters, such as Ai Ai and Hai Laoqing, is apt, neither too cold nor too hot, showing growth and change; his portrayal of the landlord Zhou Qingchen and the Nationalist Party's Northwest Army garrison commander Guan Xiangyun is also appropriate, revealing their reactionary nature without resorting to stereotypes.

	The eleven-episode TV series deeply captivates the audience because the director skillfully focuses on the "emotion" element, using emotion to touch and engage the viewers. The entire series dedicates a significant portion to depicting Ai Ai's yearning and pursuit of love. Under the historical conditions of that time, the environment did not allow her to love whom she wanted, but she bravely challenged the old forces and tenaciously pursued what she believed she deserved; Hai Laoqing and Hai Changsong, living together in a foreign land, shared hardships and helped each other sincerely; Si Quan, who pulled a rickshaw and then lost his job, in his own time of poverty, saved a fellow villager's young girl, Xiao Xiang, from a "fire pit," generously giving away his only possessions—a thirty-yuan note and an old quilted jacket; Xiao Qiang and Xiao Jian searched everywhere for their little sister who had been sold; Yan Yan, risking her life, plowed the fields for her father... The series, through these moving and vivid episodes, showcases the most precious things in human relationships—hometown bonds, friendship, kindness, and sibling love.

	The actors in this TV series are generally quite competent. They spent a long time away from the city and their families, living in humble thatched huts to shoot the series, truly embodying the spirit of dedication to art!

	In terms of acting, some actors occasionally reveal traces of stage acting, which is a common issue when stage actors perform in TV series. They are very serious, perhaps too serious. They meticulously design every action, even the smallest details, and find numerous justifications. However, from receiving a stimulus, reacting, to completing the entire action, the process is too detailed and lengthy. From a local perspective, it might feel complete, but when connecting each fully developed action, it immediately feels like the performance is dragged out, the rhythm is slow, and the focus is lost.

	Over the past decade, Henan Television and Henan's TV artists have stayed grounded in their province, working diligently to carve out their own path. From "Suona Love Talk" and "Rivalry" to "Yellow River Flows East," they have gradually developed their own style, creating a rich Henan flavor! This is truly commendable!

　　情暖人间
    ——电视连续剧《黄河东流去》观后
    果青
    严冬季节，从电视接收机中飘来一阵阵中原大地的泥土芳香，十一集电视连续剧《黄河东流去》，艺术地展现了我国三十年代末期黄河儿女的苦难生活画卷。荧屏上，一个个真实可信的人物悲欢离合，一组组别具特色的镜头深含意蕴，着意突现乡情、人情、友情和手足之情，洋溢着浓郁的“河南味”！
    《黄河东流去》是根据荣获第二届茅盾文学奖的同名长篇小说改编的。一般说来，以优秀文学巨著改编电影故事片或电视剧，常常是费力不讨好的。即便是电视连续剧容量大些，但也很难将原小说淋漓尽致地全部再现出来。除了因为长篇小说中人物众多、情节纷繁以外，作为文学作品的小说特有的心理与景物的细腻描写，往往很难转换成可视而又感人的画面形象。
    《黄河东流去》的改编，基本上是成功的。编剧李澈对原小说吃得透，有改有编，删选得当。原小说作者李准看过电视后满意地说，改编本“抓住的全是我的心尖子！”改编者从原作众多人物中选择了三家人，把他们刻画得有血有肉。就是这些活生生人物的命运，一层又一层地激起观众的情感波澜，引发人们多方面的反思。
    半路出家的导演康征同志，多年来不为“时髦”所动，不赶浪头，不东施效颦，而是一个心眼儿地追求现实主义的创作道路，老老实实地把镜头的焦点对准人物，致力于人物的塑造和刻画。对于主要角色爱爱、海老清等处理贴切，不温不火，有变化有发展；对地主周青臣和国民党西北军留守处长关相云也较相宜，既揭示出他们的反动本质，又不脸谱化。
    十一集电视连续剧所以能够深深地吸引观众，是因为导演巧妙地扣住了“情”字，以“情”感人，以“情”抓人。全剧用了较大篇幅表现了爱爱对爱情的向往和追求。处在当年的历史条件下，环境不允许她爱她所想爱，但是她仍勇敢地向旧势力挑战，顽强地追求做为一个人应该得到的；海老清和海长松两家，同居异乡患难与共，真诚相帮；拉包车而后失业的四圈，在自己贫困交加的时刻，为了解救同乡小女孩小响出“火坑”，毅然献出自己仅有的全部财产——三十元钱和那件御寒保命的旧棉袄；小强、小建四处奔走，寻找被卖出的小妹妹；雁雁不顾死活代父犁地……全剧就是通过这些感人肺腑的生动情节，表现了人间最宝贵的东西——乡情、友情、人情和手足之情。
    这部电视剧中的演员，大多都较为称职。他们长时间地离开城市、离开家庭，钻进清贫的茅草棚里拍电视剧，这种为艺术而献身的精神，实在使人敬佩！
    在演员表演方面稍感不足的是，有的演员话剧表演痕迹时有表露，这也是有些话剧演员拍电视剧时的通病。他们非常认真，过于认真。把每一个动作，甚至很细微的动作，都精心设计，并找出若干合理依据。但从接受对方的刺激、反应到整个动作完成，过程过细过长。从局部看，也许感觉很完整，而将每一个有头有尾的表演动作连接起来，就会立刻感到戏被拉长了，节奏拖沓了，重点不突出了。
    河南电视台和河南的电视艺术创作者，十年来立足本省，脚踏实地，走出了自己的路。从《唢呐情话》、《冤家》到《黄河东流去》，逐渐形成了自己的风格，拍出了浓郁的河南味！可喜可贺！
