Three members of the reactionary organization "China Democratic League" were detained in Shanghai today. Two individuals were ordered to leave the country, and one self-funded overseas student is under investigation.

Newspaper reporter Chen Mao Di reports from Shanghai that the Shanghai Public Security Bureau tonight lawfully detained members of the reactionary organization "China Democratic League," Huang Han, Huang Wen Cheng (Huang Ben), and Tang Guang Zhong. Huang Han and Huang Wen Cheng (Huang Ben), who hold Canadian and American passports respectively and came to Shanghai as tourists, have been ordered to leave the country. Tang Guang Zhong, who returned to China as a self-funded student to the U.S. under the guise of tourism, is currently under investigation.

Shanghai Public Security authorities have confirmed that Tang Guang Zhong and the other two individuals, upon arriving in Shanghai at the beginning of this year, immediately engaged in illegal activities under the name of "China Democratic League." According to a responsible person from the Shanghai Public Security Bureau, Tang Guang Zhong and the others have admitted to their illegal activities. Due to Huang Han and Huang Wen Cheng (Huang Ben) violating Chinese laws, according to Article 16 of the "Law of the People's Republic of China on the Control of Entry and Exit of Aliens," the competent authorities have shortened their stay in China and ordered them to leave the country.

　　“中国民联”三成员在沪被拘传
    两人被限令出境一自费留学生受审
    新华社上海１月７日电  （记者陈毛弟）上海市公安局今天晚上依法拘传了反动组织“中国民主团结联盟”成员黄汉、黄文成（黄奔）和汤光中。分别持加拿大和美国护照前来上海的旅游者黄汉和黄文成（黄奔）已被限令出境，以旅游名义回国的赴美自费留学生汤光中正在被审查中。
    上海公安机关查实，汤光中等三人于今年１月初抵沪后，即以“中国民联”的名义进行非法活动。据上海市公安局负责人说，汤光中等人已承认其非法活动的事实。由于黄汉、黄文成（黄奔）的行为违反了中国的法律，根据《中华人民共和国外国人入境出境管理法》第１６条规定，主管机关已缩短他们在中国停留的期限，令他们出境。
