On the morning of January 10, a blue double-cab pickup truck was parked in front of the Yiyang Municipal Guesthouse in Hunan Province. The truck bed was loaded with several hundred pounds of fresh pork and mutton. The owner shouted, "Cheap sale!" He called out while introducing: This truckload of pork and mutton was originally sent by the Meicheng Antimony Smelting Plant in Anhua County to the Hunan Branch of the China Nonferrous Metals Import and Export Corporation in Changsha as a "year-end tribute."

What was going on? It turns out that last September, to help develop mineral resources in impoverished mountainous areas and promote export-oriented products, the company signed a product procurement contract with the county's antimony smelting plant, which is under the jurisdiction of the Anhua County Township Enterprise Bureau. The company's manager and engineers went to the mountains several times to help the factory overcome technical difficulties and improve product quality. When the factory was short of funds to purchase minerals, the company advanced tens of millions of yuan in payment, solving the factory's urgent needs. With the support of the provincial company, the factory was thriving, and in four months, it made a profit of more than 200,000 yuan. During the year-end summary, the cadres and workers all said, "The prosperity of the factory is thanks to the help of the provincial company comrades. Before the Spring Festival, we must send some local products to express our gratitude." Therefore, the factory selected 200 kilograms of premium lean pork in Meicheng Town, slaughtered 5 fat mountain goats, and prepared 80 pounds of peanuts and a bag of sweet potato chips. On the 8th, the factory specially dispatched the director and deputy director to represent all the employees, driving hundreds of miles to Changsha to deliver the New Year's gifts to the provincial company.

The two managers, Chen and Wang, of the provincial company warmly received the guests from Anhua. When they heard that the factory wanted to send New Year's gifts, Manager Chen quickly declined: "The sentiments of the people of Anhua, I accept on behalf of the company, but the gifts you sent, we cannot accept even a single piece. First, helping the poor and supporting the factory to develop export-oriented products is our duty and a common cause. Second, the Party Central Committee has repeatedly banned banquets and gifts, and we must take the lead in complying with the rules." Factory Director Liu Weijun, seeing that the company leaders would not accept the gifts, proposed a compromise: "If you personally do not accept the gifts, we understand, but the pork and mutton have been transported here, and it is inconvenient to transport them back. Let us sell them to the company canteen at the market price. Would that be okay?" Manager Chen smiled and said, "Selling at market price to the company canteen is also not acceptable. If you send it, I buy it at market price, what if others send it, should I accept it or not? Thank you for your good intentions, but you should take the pork and mutton back to handle and improve the living conditions of the employees."

Director Liu became anxious and quickly handed a bag of fried sweet potato chips to Deputy Manager Wang: "You must accept this bag of sweet potato chips, otherwise, it means you look down on us mountain people. Besides, all the employees of the factory are worried about the sales of this year's products."

Deputy Manager Wang smiled and said, "Good! This bag of sweet potato chips, I accept on behalf of the company comrades. As for the sales of the products, you can rest assured."

　　送不掉的“年终贡品”
    曾瑞华
    元月１０日早上，湖南益阳地委招待所门前，停放着一辆蓝色双排座小卡车，车厢里堆放着几百斤新鲜猪肉和羊肉。“货主”高喊“便宜出卖”。他一边叫卖，一边介绍：这车猪羊肉原是安化县梅城锑品冶炼厂专程送往长沙中国有色金属进出口公司湖南分公司的“年终贡品”。
    这是怎么回事？原来，去年９月，为扶助贫困山区开发矿产资源，发展出口创汇产品，该公司同安化县乡镇企业局所属的县锑品冶炼厂，签订了产品购销合同。公司的经理和工程师先后几次进山下厂，在技术上帮助工厂破难关，提高产品质量，工厂收购矿石资金紧缺，公司又预付了几十万元货款，解决了工厂的燃眉之急。在省公司的重点扶持下，工厂生机勃勃，４个月就盈利２０多万元。年终总结时，干部工人都说：“工厂的兴旺发达，多亏了省公司同志帮忙，春节前我们一定要送点山区的土产去，感谢感谢人家。”于是，工厂就在梅城镇上选购了２００公斤上等瘦猪肉，杀５只肥山羊，提了８０斤花生和一袋红薯片，８号这天特派正副厂长代表全厂职工，驱车几百里，专程到长沙，给省公司同志送礼拜年。
    省公司的陈、王二位经理，热情接待了安化来的客人，当听说工厂要给公司送年礼，陈经理连忙谢绝：“安化人民的情意，我代表公司收下，但送来的礼物，我们一两也不能收。一则扶贫帮厂，发展创汇产品，是我们应尽的职责，也是我们共同的事业。二则党中央三令五申禁止请客送礼，我们要自觉从我做起，做到令行禁止。工厂厂长刘维军见公司领导不肯收礼，就提了个折衷方案：你们个人不收礼，我们支持，但猪羊肉运来了，运回去很不方便，让我们平价卖给公司食堂，这该行吧”？陈经理笑着说：“平价卖给公司食堂也不行，你送来的我平价收购，人家也送来，我该收不收呢？谢谢你的好意，你还是把猪羊肉拖回去处理，改善改善职工生活。”
    刘厂长急了，连忙把一袋油炸红薯片递给王副经理：“这点红薯片一定要收下，要不就是你们看不起我们山区人，再说全厂职工都在担心今年产品的销售？”
    王副经理笑着说：“好！这包红薯片，我代表公司同志收下。至于产品的销售，你们可以放心。”
