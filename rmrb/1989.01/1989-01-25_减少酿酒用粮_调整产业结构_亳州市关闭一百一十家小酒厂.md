	Bozhou City, known as the "Ten-Li Alcohol Village," has decided to reduce the use of grain for alcohol production and shut down 110 small alcohol factories.

	In recent years, the number of small alcohol factories in Bozhou City's townships has surged, reaching 178 by the end of last year. This not only increased the burden of grain used for alcohol production but also led to quality issues and poor sales for some of these small factories, making it difficult for them to continue operations. Bozhou City has decided to close down a batch of small alcohol factories to protect key alcohol producers.

	After some small alcohol factories ceased production, Bozhou City actively helped them with follow-up work. Currently, 10 factories have repurposed their original facilities and equipment, with minor modifications, to produce edible fungi. Seven factories have been sold to new owners for other uses, and two have been acquired by the economically and technologically stronger Guijiu Town First Alcohol Factory. The adjustment work is still ongoing.

    亳州市关闭一百一十家小酒厂
    新华社合肥１月２４日电  据《安徽日报》报道：以“十里酒乡”著称的安徽省亳州市减少酿酒用粮，停掉１１０家小酒厂。
    近几年来，亳州市乡镇小酒厂一哄而起，截至去年底剧增到１７８家。这不仅加大了酿酒用粮负担；而且一些小酒厂由于资金紧缺，产品质量不高，销路不畅，难以为继。亳州市决定停掉一批小酒厂以保重点酒厂。
    一些小酒厂停产后，亳州市积极帮助他们做好善后工作。现在有１０家利用原有的厂房、设备，稍加改造后生产食用菌；有７家卖给新的主户，改作它用；有两家被经济技术实力较强的古井镇第一酒厂兼并。调整工作目前还在进行中。
