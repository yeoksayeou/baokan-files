The Legend of "Idiot Head"
- A Record of the Squad Leader Hao Liangchao of the Qingdao Armed Police Force

Iron sand palm breaking bricks, hard head smashing rocks, abdomen bearing a thousand pounds... These are the scenes of Qingdao armed police soldier Hao Liangchao performing for foreign guests.

Last May, Dr. Karl Muller, the leader of the Austrian police delegation, led his team to Qingdao and requested to personally witness the real kung fu of Chinese police. Two soldiers struggled to lift a 200-pound large stone onto Hao Liangchao's head, and a soldier raised a 12-pound iron hammer and struck it down hard, "crack," the stone split in two with a sound. The guests watched in astonishment. Dr. Karl Muller walked up, moved the broken stone block, and carefully examined Hao Liangchao's head before exclaiming, "Amazing, amazing! The 'iron head' skill is indeed legendary. I will definitely invite you to Austria to teach your art."

Hao Liangchao's martial arts skills have played a significant role in his duties. In early 1986, the Stankou District of Qingdao City held a lantern festival at the skating rink. Shortly after the festival began, more than 20 lawbreakers armed with wooden sticks and kitchen knives started fighting. Hao Liangchao, who was on duty, saw the situation and with a shout, jumped into the midst of the troublemakers. The thugs rushed forward, and 3 or 4 wooden sticks struck Hao Liangchao's head with all their might. Some of the sticks broke in half, while others were shaken off. At this moment, one of the thugs recognized the young man in the police uniform and shouted, "Run, it's 'Idiot Head' Hao!" The crowd of thugs scattered in a panic. One of the thugs tried to run but couldn't get up, lying on the ground and shouting, "Master Hao, spare my life! Master Hao, spare my life!" Over the years, Hao Liangchao has captured many criminals and has been awarded the Third-Class Merit twice.

　　“郝铁头”传奇
    ——记武警青岛支队班长郝良超
    铁砂掌击碎砖块、硬功头开顽石、腹载千斤……这是青岛武警战士郝良超给外宾表演的一组镜头。
    去年５月，奥地利警官访问团团长卡尔·缪勒博士率团到青岛访问，要求亲眼目睹中国警察的真功夫。２名战士费力地把一块２００多斤的大石头抬到郝良超的头顶上，一名战士举起１２磅的铁锤狠狠砸下去，“啪”，石头应声裂成两半。贵宾看得目瞪口呆。卡尔·缪勒博士走上前去搬了搬击破的石块，又仔细察看了郝良超的头顶后叹服地说：“了不起，了不起！‘铁脑袋’功夫名不虚传，以后一定邀请你到奥地利传艺”。
    郝良超的武术功夫在执勤中发挥了很大作用。１９８６年初，青岛市沧口区在溜冰场举行灯会。灯会开始不久，２０多名不法分子手持木棍、菜刀打起来。担负执勤任务的郝良超见状，“呀”的一声跳到闹事者中间。歹徒冲上前来，３、４根木棍一齐狠狠地砸在郝良超头上，只见木棍有的顿时断成两截，有的被震飞。这时，一名歹徒认出了这位穿警服的小伙子，失声叫道：“快跑，他就是‘郝铁头’！”众歹徒一听，一轰而散。一名歹徒想跑却爬不起来，趴在地上连喊：“郝师傅饶命！郝师傅饶命！”几年来，郝良超捉拿了不少凶犯，两次荣立三等功。
