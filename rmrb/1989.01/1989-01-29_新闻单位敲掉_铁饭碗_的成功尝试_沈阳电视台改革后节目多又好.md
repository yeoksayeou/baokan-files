The reform of Shenyang Television Station has become a piece of news in the news industry. Last year, they transitioned from relying on state subsidies to being economically self-sufficient. Internally, they implemented a system of layer-by-layer hiring, optimizing the composition of the team, and stimulating the enthusiasm of editors and reporters. Over the past year, the number of television programs broadcast by the station has increased, and their quality has significantly improved. They were the first among national television stations to achieve the goal of not requiring state subsidies for operational funds.

The Shenyang Television Station, which has only been in operation for five years, faced two major challenges in its development: first, the municipal budget allocation was insufficient, and second, the editors and reporters, who held "iron rice bowls" and ate from the "big pot," lacked work enthusiasm. With the support of the municipal party committee and government, they first targeted the old system of relying on state subsidies. Economically, they transformed from a "full budget" unit to a self-sufficient unit. Previously, the municipal government allocated 1.35 million yuan in operational funds annually. After the reform, except for special funds, they no longer received any municipal financial support.

The station adjusted its organizational structure, redefined its staffing, and set a two-year term for the heads of various departments. Then, each department head, following the principle of optimizing the team, hired staff members with a one-year term. After a round of competition, five general staff members were hired as department heads or deputy heads. Out of the station's 238 employees, 22 were not hired, including four former department heads or deputy heads, 11 reporters and editors, and seven technical, administrative staff members, and workers. These individuals, after being on standby, only received their base salary without bonuses. If they remained un-hired for more than half a year, they would only receive 70% of their base salary.

They also broke away from the "big pot" system in distribution. Various business departments implemented target quota management: the News Department, Cultural and Sports Department, and Television Drama Department implemented piecework bonuses for over-fulfillment. The more news, programs, and dramas produced, the more bonuses received. Reporters who over-fulfilled their work targets received 150 yuan in bonuses per month, while those who did not complete their tasks received no bonuses. For the two operational departments—the Advertising Department and the Television Service Center—they implemented enterprise-style management with revenue contracts. From the start of the contract, the wages and bonuses of the contractors and staff members were completely suspended, and they were only lent 50 yuan per month for living expenses.

The new system has brought unprecedented vitality to Shenyang Television Station. Previously, the work rhythm of reporters in the News Department often involved shooting one piece of news in the morning and submitting it in the afternoon, completing their work for the day. Now, they often shoot and broadcast two or even three pieces of news in a day, selecting the best from the best, and significantly reducing low-value personal news and meeting news. Last year, the number of scripts adopted by provincial and central television stations reached over 500, an increase of 40% compared to the previous year. Without adding more personnel or equipment, they increased a Sunday program lasting four hours and three English news broadcasts per week. Previously, to add these two programs, at least 700,000 yuan in funds and more than ten additional staff members would have been required.

### 新闻单位敲掉“铁饭碗”的成功尝试  沈阳电视台改革后节目多又好

　　新闻单位敲掉“铁饭碗”的成功尝试    
    沈阳电视台改革后节目多又好
    本报讯  新华社记者刘欣欣报道：沈阳电视台的体制改革，成为新闻界的一桩新闻。去年，他们由靠国家拨款过日子变为经济上自收自支以后，内部人员实行层层聘任，优化组合，激励编辑记者的工作热情。一年来，该台播出的电视节目比过去数量增多，质量明显提高，在全国电视台中最先实现事业费不要国家拨款。
    仅有５年历史的沈阳电视台在发展中遇到两大难题：一是市财政拨款少，二是端着“铁饭碗”吃“大锅饭”的编辑、记者等人员工作热情不高。在市委、市政府的支持下，他们首先向吃“皇粮”的旧体制开刀，经济上由“全额预算”单位改为自收自支单位。过去，市政府每年拨给事业费１３５万元，改革后除专项基金外，不要市财政一分钱。
    这个台调整机构，重新定编定员，各部门负责人聘期２年。然后，再由各部门负责人按优化组合原则，聘用工作人员，聘期一年。经过一番竞争，有５名一般干部被聘为部主任或副主任。全台２３８名职工中，有２２人落聘，其中有４名原正副部主任，记者编辑１１名，技术、行政人员和工人７名。这些人在待聘之后只发工资不发奖金，如超过半年仍没被聘用，只发７０％工资。
    他们还在分配上打破“大锅饭”。各业务部门实行目标定额管理：新闻部、文体部、电视剧部等实行超额计件奖金，谁拍的新闻多、节目多、剧目多，谁就多得。工作超额多的记者１月得奖金１５０元，完不成任务的一分奖金不得。对两个经营部门——广告部和电视服务中心实行企业化管理，创收承包。自承包之日起，承包人和工作人员的工资、奖金全部停发，每月只借给５０元生活费。
    新体制使沈阳电视台呈现前所未有的生机和活力。新闻部记者的工作节奏往往是上午采拍一条新闻，下午回来交卷，一天工作就完了。现在常常是一天采播两条甚至３条新闻，稿子精中选优，新闻价值低的人情稿和会议新闻大大减少。去年被省和中央电视台采用的稿件达５００多条，比上一年增加了４０％。他们在没有增添人和设备的情况下，新增了星期日一次长达４个小时的节目和每周３次的英语新闻。而以往要增加这两次节目，至少也得增加７０万元经费和十几名工作人员。
