The North Case Remains Unresolved
By Cang Lide, Correspondent

A U.S. federal special court is scheduled to open the trial of Oliver North, a key figure in the "Iran-Contra" affair, on January 31. Due to disputes over two issues involving "national security" and the subpoena of the current President and Vice President to testify, the White House and North's lawyers have clashed, making the once-dormant North case once again a hot topic among the American public and media.

After multiple congressional hearings and a 14-month thorough investigation by a federal grand jury, it was ultimately determined that North faces 14 charges. Among these, aside from providing false information to Congress, privately altering, transferring, and destroying government documents, obstructing congressional investigations, and illegally accepting a $4,300 traveler's check, the two most critical charges are conspiracy and theft of government property. The primary allegations are that North privately transferred $14 million in profits from arms sales to Iran to the Nicaraguan Contra rebels. Prosecutors will use this as the basis for their indictment, unless President Reagan personally orders a pardon for North.

However, North denies these two charges. In the hearings, he spoke passionately, asserting that his actions were out of "patriotism" and in the interest of the United States, and that White House documents and the President could prove his innocence. North's defense lawyer thus requested that President Reagan and Vice President Bush testify in court and present secret documents held by the White House. Special court judge Gesell ordered the White House to provide the necessary documents, word for word, without any alterations, to ensure the "fairness of the trial."

Upon hearing this, Reagan stated at the end of last year that he would not order a pardon for North and agreed to consider written responses to "reasonable questions"; Bush later made a similar statement. The White House and the Department of Justice firmly opposed the subpoena of the President, stating that this action was "unprecedented" and involved "significant legal and constitutional issues," as the law stipulates that the "sitting President cannot testify in person." The White House also stated that presenting the secret documents requested by the lawyers would endanger the lives of foreign leaders involved and jeopardize U.S. "national security and foreign relations."

Since evidence to indict North could not be obtained, independent counsel Walsh proposed on January 5 to drop the two charges against North, but this was rejected by Gesell. He believed that unless the Attorney General provided proof that disclosing secret evidence would compromise national security, Walsh's independent prosecution would be restricted.

On January 12, Attorney General Thornburgh, based on consultations with six high-ranking government officials, including the CIA director, decided that secret evidence could not be disclosed and subsequently proposed this to Walsh, providing an affidavit. The next day, Gesell announced the formal dismissal of the two charges against North. However, he stated that the dismissal of the charges was not due to insufficient evidence, but rather based on a federal law provision that the Attorney General is the final arbiter on whether to disclose government secrets, and the court was "powerless" in this regard. The Department of Justice immediately stated that the President and Vice President no longer needed to testify.

According to relevant U.S. criminal laws, the federal special court can sentence North to a maximum of 60 years in prison and a $300,000 fine based on his other 12 charges. Nevertheless, the most important two charges seem to be left unresolved. An editorial in The Washington Post pointed out that such a trial that avoids the key issues cannot unravel the mysteries surrounding the "Iran-Contra" affair. Some people believe that although the U.S. has a system of "separation of powers," the dismissal of the two key charges means that high-ranking administrative officials, when violating criminal laws, can use secrecy as a means of "self-protection." Senate Democratic leader Mitchell stated that the Senate would continue to investigate the issues of secrecy and declassification in criminal cases, and if necessary, consider enacting new legislation.

　　“诺思案”悬而未决
    本报记者  仓立德
    美国联邦特别法庭定于本月３１日开庭审判“伊朗门”事件的核心人物诺思。由于对诺思的两项涉及“国家安全”和传唤现任总统、副总统出庭作证问题，白宫与诺思的律师发生了冲突，遂使一度沉寂的诺思案再次成为美国公众和舆论的热门话题。
    经过多次国会听证和联邦大陪审团长达１４个月的周密调查，最终确定诺思有１４项罪名。其中除向国会提供假情况，私自篡改、转移、销毁政府文件，妨碍国会调查，非法接受价值４３００美元旅行支票等，最为关键的两项是诺思犯有阴谋罪和盗窃政府财产罪，主要罪状是私自将卖给伊朗军火的１４００多万美元利润转给了尼加拉瓜反政府武装。检察官将据此提出起诉，除非里根总统亲自下令赦免诺思。
    然而，诺思否认对他的这两项指控。他在听证会上慷慨陈词，认为自己所做所为均出于“爱国主义”，符合美国利益，并称白宫文件和总统可以证明自己无罪。诺思的辩护律师遂要求传唤里根总统和布什副总统出庭作证，并出示白宫掌握的有关秘密文件。特别法庭法官格塞尔命令白宫提供所需文件，并要逐字逐句，不加删改，以保证“审判的公正”。
    里根闻讯后于去年年底表示，他不会下令赦免诺思，同意考虑书面答复“合理的问题”；布什稍后也做了相同表示。白宫及司法部坚决反对传唤总统，称此举“史无前例”，涉及“重大法律与宪法问题”，因为法律规定“现任总统不能当堂作证”。白宫还表示，出示律师要求的秘密文件将危及当事的外国领导人的性命，破坏美国的“国家安全和对外关系”。
    既然无法得到起诉诺思的证据，独立检察官沃尔什不得不在１月５日提议撤销对诺思的这两项指控，但遭到格塞尔拒绝。他认为，除非司法部长提供公开秘密证据便会破坏国家安全的证明，否则便限制了沃尔什的独立起诉行动。
    １２日，司法部长索恩伯格根据中央情报局局长等６位政府高级官员的磋商结果决定，秘密证据不能公开，随后向沃尔什提出建议，并提供了宣誓书。次日格塞尔宣布，正式取消诺思的这两项罪名。但他表示，撤销罪名并非因为证据不足，而是根据联邦法律的一项规定，司法部长是能否公开政府秘密文件的最后仲裁人，法庭对此已“无能为力”。司法部随即表示，总统、副总统已无必要出庭作证。
    根据美国有关刑法规定，联邦特别法庭可以根据诺思的其他１２项罪名判处他最高６０年徒刑和３００万美元罚款。尽管如此，最重要的两项指控看来只能以不了了之。《华盛顿邮报》的一篇社论指出，这种避重就轻的审判不能解开笼罩“伊朗门”事件的谜团。一些人士则认为，虽然美国有“三权分立”的政府权力制衡法，但撤销两项关键指控意味着高级行政官员在触犯到刑律时，可以保密为由实行“自我保护”。国会参议院民主党领袖米切尔表示，参院在此案中将继续调查涉及刑事案件的保密与销密问题，如有必要将考虑制定一项新的立法。
