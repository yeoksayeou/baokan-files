Title: The Publication of "A Dictionary of 'Capital'"
Author: Kaiwen
Date: 1989-01-07
Edition: 3

The publication of "A Dictionary of 'Capital'" is a significant event in the world of academic literature. In today's bookstores, where dictionaries abound, there has been a notable absence of a dictionary dedicated to the study of Marx's classic work, "Capital." This gap has now been filled by the recent release of "A Dictionary of 'Capital'" by Shandong People's Publishing House.

This comprehensive reference book, edited by economist Song Tao, is the first of its kind in China. It is the result of over three years of collaborative effort by nearly 300 experts and scholars. The dictionary incorporates the latest research findings on "Capital," featuring over 2,000 entries that cover categories, concepts, schools of thought, doctrines, names of individuals, and various works cited or referenced in "Capital."
