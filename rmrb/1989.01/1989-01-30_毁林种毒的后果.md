Title: The Consequences of Deforestation for Drug Cultivation

In the Amazon rainforest region of Peru, the extensive deforestation due to the cultivation of coca leaves, the processing of coca leaves into cocaine, and the trafficking of drugs has already resulted in severe ecological damage. An ecologist exclaimed that this is "like dropping an atomic bomb."

Just a few years ago, this region was a pristine rainforest. Now, it is estimated that 200,000 hectares have been planted with coca leaves, which will be abandoned once the soil is depleted, turning into wasteland. To build drying ovens and processing workshops, many trees have been cut down. There are also hundreds of airstrips here, where small planes from Colombia fly in to transport the cocaine paste. The reckless felling of trees has reached a staggering 700,000 hectares, reducing one of South America's most important sources of oxygen. Due to severe weathering and soil erosion, changes in the hydrological system have led to a decrease in water resources and aquatic resources. The chemical waste from the production of cocaine paste has caused the death of several species of fish and aquatic plants in the Huallaga River.

Since 1981, the Peruvian government has implemented the Upper Huallaga Special Plan to reduce coca cultivation, providing loans and technical assistance to farmers to switch to growing coffee, cocoa, bananas, and beans, but with little effect. The relevant departments are now looking for a chemical agent that can be sprayed from the air to penetrate the roots of plants, disrupting their photosynthesis and destroying the coca leaves without harming other plants.

　　毁林种毒的后果
    在秘鲁的亚马孙原始森林地区，由于种植古柯叶、用古柯叶加工可卡因及贩运毒品而大量毁林，已经带来破坏生态的严重后果。一位生态学家惊呼这“如同扔下一颗原子弹”。
    这一地区几年前还是原始森林，现在则估计已种植了２０万公顷古柯叶，一旦地力耗尽就会被抛弃，成为荒地。为了建烘烤炉及加工车间，也砍了很多树。这里还建有上百个飞机场，来自哥伦比亚的小飞机到这里运走可卡因浆。滥伐林地已达到７０万公顷的惊人数字，减少了南美洲最重要的氧气来源。因为风化和水土流失严重，水文系统的变化已引起水力资源和水生物资源的减少。生产可卡因浆使用的化学药品的废物使瓦亚加河的几种鱼类和水生植物死亡。
    从１９８１年起，秘鲁政府就制定了减少古柯种植的上瓦亚加特殊计划，通过向农民提供贷款和技术帮助，让他们改种咖啡、可可、香蕉和豆类，但成效不大。有关部门正寻找一种药物，从空中喷撒后浸入植物根部破坏其光合作用，毁坏古柯叶而不伤害其他植物。
