Political pluralism has yielded a new product: non-party representatives in the Hungarian Parliament have formed the "Non-Party Group."

The New China News Agency reported from Budapest on January 24 that some non-party members of the Hungarian Parliament held a meeting today to formally establish the "Non-Party Group" in the Parliament.

The Hungarian Parliament has 387 representatives, 77% of whom are party members. Party-member representatives have long had their own organizations. Before each parliamentary session, someone introduces the issues to be discussed and reports the party's stance to them. In the process of expanding parliamentary democracy, more and more people believe this is an unequal phenomenon, and all non-party member representatives strongly demand the establishment of their own organization.

At today's "Non-Party Group" founding meeting, 51 non-party member representatives attended, accounting for more than half of the total number of non-party member representatives. The attendees stated that the establishment of the "Non-Party Group" is not to oppose anyone but to provide non-party member representatives with more channels to understand the real situation, making it easier for them to determine their own attitudes. They also announced that the meetings of the "Non-Party Group" are completely open, and all parliamentary representatives are welcome to participate.

The non-party member representatives elected Fodor István as the chairman of the "Non-Party Group." The head of the "Party Group" in the Parliament, Magyar Szocialista Munkáspárt (Hungarian Socialist Workers' Party) Central Committee member Szűrös Mátyás, attended to congratulate and expressed the hope that the "Non-Party Group" and "Party Group" in the Parliament would work closely together.

The emergence of the "Non-Party Group" in the Hungarian Parliament is seen as a product of the country's implementation of political pluralism.

    匈国会非党代表成立“党外派”
    新华社布达佩斯１月２４日电（记者侯凤菁）匈牙利国会代表中的一些非党人士今天举行会议，正式成立国会“党外派”组织。
    匈牙利国会共有３８７名代表，其中党员代表占７７％。党员国会代表早有自己的团体，每次国会会议召开前，专门有人就会议将要讨论的问题向他们介绍情况并通报党中央的有关立场。在扩大国会民主的过程中，越来越多的人认为这是不平等的现象，一切非党员国会代表也强烈要求成立自己的团体。
    在今天举行的“党外派”成立大会上，共有５１名非党员国会代表出席，占非党员国会代表总数的一半以上。与会者表示，成立“党外派”不是为了反对什么人，而是为了使非党员国会代表拥有更多了解真实情况的渠道，便于他们决定自己的态度。他们还宣布，“党外派”的集会完全公开，所有国会代表均可参加。
    非党员国会代表们选举了福多尔·伊什特万任“党外派”主席。国会“党内派”负责人、匈牙利社会主义工人党中央书记絮勒什·马加什到会祝贺，他希望国会中的“党外派”和“党内派”密切合作。
    匈牙利国会出现“党外派”，被认为是国家实行政治多元化的产物。
