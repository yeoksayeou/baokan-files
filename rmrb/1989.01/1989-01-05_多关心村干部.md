Title: Pay More Attention to Village Cadres

Recently, I conducted investigations in some rural areas and came into contact with several village cadres. To my surprise, they knew very little about the current rural work policies. When asked about the rural family planning policy, they only knew that having an extra child would result in a fine of one thousand yuan. When asked what to do if someone builds a house on contracted land, they replied that the contracted land belongs to the farmers, and the cadres have no say in it.

The main reason for this situation is that a significant number of village cadres do not study the Party's policies. Now, the rectification of the economic environment and the rectification of the economic order have been ongoing for some time, but some grassroots cadres are completely unaware of these efforts. Some meetings that should be held are not held for months at a time. The problems I saw in some rural areas, such as certain grassroots cadres leading the way in occupying residential land, cutting down trees indiscriminately, embezzling fertilizers awarded by relevant departments to the masses, and embezzling educational funds, as well as engaging in public-funded travel and extravagant banquets for inspection and acceptance teams, have many causes. However, the fact that they do not hear or learn what they should is also a significant factor.

The various tasks in rural areas ultimately rely on village cadres to implement. Some regions' leaders have overlooked the training and education of village cadres, paying little attention to the ideological and organizational construction of village cadres. As a result, some grassroots organizations are weak and dispersed, failing to play their due roles.

I hope that the cadres of various local leading organs will step out of their offices and pay more attention to village cadres.

　　多关心村干部
    朱玉国
    近日到一些农村地区调查，接触到几个村干部，令人吃惊的是，他们对目前农村工作政策知之甚少。问到农村计划生育政策，只知道多生一个孩子罚一千元；问有人在承包土地上盖房怎么办？回答说，承包地是农民自己的地，干部管不着。
    造成这种状况的原因，主要是相当一部分村干部不学习党的政策。现在，治理经济环境、整顿经济秩序已有时日，但某些基层干部却一无所知。一些该开的会几个月不开一次。我在一些农村地区看到的弊端，诸如某些基层干部带头抢占宅基地、乱砍滥伐树木、私吞有关部门奖励群众的化肥、侵占教育经费，以及搞公费旅游、接待验收团大吃大喝等等，产生的原因固然很多，但他们该听的该学的听不到学不到，也是原因之一。
    农村的各项工作，最终得靠村干部去贯彻执行。一些地区的领导恰恰忽视了农村干部的培训学习，对村干部的思想建设、组织建设过问甚少，致使一些基层组织软弱涣散，起不到应有的作用。
    愿各地领导机关的干部走出办公室，关心一下村干部。
