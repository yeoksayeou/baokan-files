Two new computer technology achievements were showcased today in Beijing by the software publishing department of Guangming Daily Press, and demonstrated to the capital's media.

The "Computer Audio-Visual Language Self-Study System" is a result of combining language teaching with computer technology. By simply pressing keys on the computer keyboard, the screen will display the required words or phrases, while a synchronized audio playback will read them aloud. After a short while, the screen will convert the Chinese characters into English and read them aloud as well.

The second achievement is a Chinese and Western character processing machine, jointly developed by the software publishing department, Sharp Corporation of Japan, and Maruichi Commercial Corporation of Tokyo. This machine can process simplified Chinese characters and convert them into traditional Chinese characters.

　　两项计算机技术新成果在京演示
    本报北京１月２０日讯  两项计算机技术新成果，今天由光明日报出版社软件出版部推出，向首都新闻界作演示。
    “电脑视听语言自学系统”是语言教学与计算机结合的成果。只需轻按电脑键盘，屏幕上便会出现所需要的语词诗词，边上的录音机同步放出朗读声，过一会儿，屏幕把刚才成语词诗词变成英文，并读出声音。
    由软件出版部与日本夏普株式会社、东京丸一商事株式会社合作制成的中西文字处理机，既可以处理简体字，也可以将这些文字转换成繁体字。
