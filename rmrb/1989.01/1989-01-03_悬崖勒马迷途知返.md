Last September 3, a young woman came to the Procuratorate of Fuyang County, Shaanxi Province, confessing that she had embezzled nearly 10,000 yuan of public funds and was willing to return all of it, requesting lenient treatment. The story is as follows:

In 1971, a 33-year-old woman named Song was assigned from Xinjiang to the staff hospital of the Changqing Petroleum Exploration Company in Shaanxi to work as a cashier. In July 1981, Song took advantage of the accountant's absence and embezzled 130 yuan from the pharmacy's turnover. Three years passed, and no one ever questioned the incident, so her long-suspended heart finally settled. In May 1984, she used the same method to embezzle 460 yuan from the pharmacy's turnover. More than a year passed, and she still hadn't been discovered. From then on, her courage grew. In February 1986 and September 1986, Song embezzled public funds totaling 9,100 yuan in two separate incidents. Including the previous two incidents, she had embezzled a total of 9,800 yuan in public funds.

Last year, whistleblower centers and hotlines were established nationwide, and Song began to feel restless, thinking over and over again, feeling that the only way out was to turn herself in. In a document submitted to the county procuratorate, she wrote the following confession: "Money can bring joy and happiness to people's lives, but it can also bring pain and worry, even leading people to the depths of crime. As the saying goes, 'A gentleman loves money, but takes it by the right means.' Illegitimate money must not be taken. My crime is a bitter lesson, and it is also the bitter pill I have made for myself. In the long journey of life ahead, I am determined to get up wherever I fall, remember the past, start from zero, learn the law and abide by it, reform my ways, and start anew."

　　悬崖勒马迷途知返
    去年９月３日，一年轻妇女来到陕西富县检察院坦白自己贪污公款近万元，愿意全部退赔，请求给予宽大处理。事情经过是这样的：
    １９７１年，３３岁的宋某从新疆分配到陕西长庆石油勘探公司某职工医院做出纳员。１９８１年７月，宋乘会计不在之机，第一次将药房上交的１３０多元现金揣入腰包。３年多过去了，始终无人问起这件事，她一颗悬了许久的心放了下来。１９８４年５月，她以同样手段贪污药房上交款４６０多元，过了一年多，仍未被人发现。从此，她的胆子便大了起来。１９８６年２月和１９８６年９月，宋又两次贪污公款共９１００元。连同以前的两次共贪污公款９８００多元。
    去年，全国各地普遍设立举报中心和举报电话，宋某开始坐立不安，思前想后，觉得只有投案自首才是唯一的出路。在给县检察院的一份材料中，她写下了如下的忏悔录：“金钱会给人们的生活带来快乐和幸福，也会给人们带来痛苦和忧愁，甚至会引人走向犯罪的深渊。常言道：‘君子爱财，取之有道’，不义之财万万不可取。我的犯罪就是一个沉痛的教训，这也是我为自己酿成的苦酒。在今后漫长的生活道路上，我决心哪里跌倒哪里爬起，牢记过去，从零开始，学法守法，痛改前非，重新做人。”　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　（马冲霄）
