The Ninth Five Goats Cup Chinese Chess Champion Tournament has concluded with the final rankings determined. The champion of this tournament is Guangdong's Lu Qin, with Shanghai's Hu Ronghua, Hebei's Li Laiqun, and Hubei's Liu Dahua securing the second, third, and fourth positions respectively.

Yesterday evening's match between Hu Ronghua and Lu Qin was particularly noteworthy. After losing to Lu Qin the previous night, Hu Ronghua needed to win this match to have a chance at defending his title the next day. Hu Ronghua opened with a Five-Seven Cannon formation. Observers in the viewing room noted that this formation often ends in a draw in previous competitions, suggesting that Hu had a new strategy. By the tenth move, Hu adjusted his formation to capture Lu's horse that had crossed the river, followed by moving his chariot to the ninth file to block Lu's chariot and cannon, creating a formidable offensive. Known as the "Young General of the Goat City," Lu Qin remained composed, skillfully maneuvering his pieces to defend. He made a crucial move by advancing his chariot to the second file and then to the fourth file, a brilliant move. Hu should have advanced his ninth file soldier to strengthen his defense, making it impossible for Lu to find an opportunity. However, Hu made a weak move by advancing his advisor to the fifth file, allowing Lu to seize the moment. Lu retreated his cannon to capture the chariot, exchanged pieces at the river, and then moved his cannon to protect his horse, executing a series of flawless moves. Suddenly, the tension on the board dissipated, and Hu's offensive was completely neutralized. The situation reversed rapidly, putting Hu on the defensive. In the end, Lu captured the isolated piece with his chariot, threatening both the horse and the king, while also advancing a soldier across the river. Seeing the inevitable, Hu conceded defeat.

　　第九届五羊杯冠军赛排出座次   
    广州吕钦力克上海胡荣华名列榜首
    本报广州１月２１日电  第九届五羊杯象棋冠军赛，各棋王的名次已排定，本届盟主被广东吕钦获得，上海胡荣华、河北李来群和湖北柳大华列第２、３、４位。
    昨天晚上争夺冠军的胡荣华与吕钦一战最引人注目。因前晚胡荣华负给吕钦，昨晚只有扳回一盘才有希望争取明天再搏杀，实现卫冕的愿望。胡荣华执红子列出五七炮局。观棋室的棋宿认为：这种棋式在以往的赛事中多以和棋为告终，今晚老胡排此阵必有新着。走至第１０回合，胡变抬平车捉吕过河马，紧接着又调九路车串住吕钦八路车炮，大军压境，声势浩大。被誉为羊城“少帅”的吕钦沉着调兵遣将，在步步解围中走出车２平４好着。胡本应挺起九路兵，全面布兵极严密，令吕钦无机可乘，但却走出士四进五软着，被吕钦抓住喘息之机，退炮打车、河头兑车，然后平炮保马，简直是一气呵成，顿时棋面上硝烟散去，胡的攻势全部被瓦解，形势急转直下，胡处于被动挨打，最后，吕钦沉车抓孤相，车马立中既打马又威胁老帅，还有一只过河卒。胡见大势已去，俯首称臣。
