The family agricultural research institute of Feng Hongzhang in Xia County, Shanxi Province, has been focusing on the study of diseases affecting cotton, melons, vegetables, rice, and corn. The institute has developed a plant growth regulator called "Kangkuning," which has been marketed in over 2,100 counties nationwide, achieving remarkable economic benefits.

The "Feng Hongzhang Family Agricultural Research Institute" was established in July 1984. It is primarily composed of Feng Hongzhang's family members and includes voluntary agricultural science and technology researchers, rural educated youth, and farmers interested in agricultural research. They started by addressing the difficulties encountered in crop cultivation, particularly focusing on the wilting and yellowing diseases of cotton and other crops. After 330 experiments, they successfully developed a new type of fungicide and plant growth regulator called "Kangkuning." This formulation effectively controls over 30 types of crop diseases and promotes plant growth and development. It has been demonstrated and promoted in 1,700 county-level plant protection companies across the country, with an effectiveness rate of over 85%. The product has been approved by national research departments for production and has obtained a national patent.

The institute prioritizes serving farmers, ensuring that farmers achieve increased yields, even if it means the institute gains less or no profit. When farmers were not fully aware of the performance and effects of "Kangkuning," the institute took on heavy debts to promote the product. Salespeople traveled from village to village, selling 190,000 yuan worth of products on credit to local farmers. They also donated 8,000 yuan and a portion of "Kangkuning" to farmers for scientific experiments without any charge. Their only concern was: "What are the results? We will hear the feedback in the autumn." Over the years, their efforts have resulted in "Kangkuning" being promoted and used in 57 million mu of farmland across 2,100 counties nationwide, achieving excellent economic benefits. According to different regions across the country, the increased yield benefit of "Kangkuning" in 1988 was approximately 900 million yuan.

　　冯宏章家庭农科所令人瞩目
    创制的“抗枯宁”植物生长调节剂获国家专利
    产品行销二千余县去年取得增产效益九亿元
    本报讯  记者王艾生报道：山西夏县城关镇农民冯宏章创办的家庭农科所，致力于棉花、瓜类、蔬菜、水稻、玉米等作物的病害研究，该所创制的“抗枯宁”植物生长调节剂，行销全国２１００多个县，获得令人瞩目的经济效益。
    “冯宏章家庭农科所”创办于１９８４年７月，以冯宏章家庭成员为主体，吸收自愿加入的农业科技研究人员、乡村知青、有志于农业科研的农民参加。他们从农作物栽培所遇到的难题出发，集中主攻棉花及其它农作物的枯黄萎缩病，经过３３０次试验，终于制成一种新型杀菌剂和植物生长调节剂——抗枯宁。这种制剂，对农作物的３０多种病害有明显的防治效果，还可促进农作物的生长发育，在全国１７００个县级植保公司示范试验推广，有效率在８５％以上，经国家科研部门鉴定，投入生产，并获国家专利。
    这个农科所以服务农民为本分，只要让农民有了增产效果，宁可少获利或不获利。当农民还不甚了解“抗枯宁”的性能效果时，农科所自负重债，推销人员走村串庄，一户户地把价值１９万元的产品，赊销给当地农民。还拿出８０００元和一部分“抗枯宁”，无偿送给农民进行科技实验。他们只求一件事：“效果怎样，秋后有个回音”。几年来努力的结果，“抗枯宁”已在全国２１００个县的５７００万亩农田中推广使用，获得良好的经济效益。据全国不同地区的测定，１９８８年“抗枯宁”取得的增产效益在９亿元左右。
