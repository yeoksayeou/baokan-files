Over 80,000 Layers Urgently Need Feed

In the spring of 1988, our township raised nearly 200,000 chicks, with at least 150,000 surviving. The township requires 80,000 kilograms of chicken feed daily. Since June 1988, the township's grain supply department, which is in charge of feed, has stopped supplying chicken feed due to water transportation being unavailable and high land transportation costs. Currently, over 60,000 roosters have been sold, leaving 80,000 new hens that are kept for egg production. Their feed supply is becoming increasingly tight, and some poultry farmers have to use grain to feed the chickens. In Xinbei Village, poultry farmer Liu Zhancheng used all 3,000 kilograms of his harvested wheat and 500 kilograms of corn to feed the chickens, which is still not enough. Recently, he sold over 400 new hens and ate 30 himself. Many poultry farmers are preparing to dispose of the new hens that have started or are about to start laying eggs. We suggest that relevant departments quickly resolve the issue of insufficient chicken feed.

　　八万多只蛋鸡急等饲料
    １９８８年春季，我乡饲养了近２０万只雏鸡，成活的至少有１５万只，全乡每天需鸡饲料８万公斤。１９８８年６月以来，乡里主管饲料的粮管所因水运不通，陆地运费太高，便停止供应鸡饲料。眼下，６万多只公鸡上市了，剩下留着产蛋的８万多只新母鸡的饲料越来越紧张，有的鸡农只好用粮食喂养。新北村养鸡户刘展程家收获的３０００多公斤小麦和５００公斤玉米全给鸡吃了仍然不足，最近，他一次卖掉新母鸡４００多只，自家还吃了３０多只。许多养鸡户准备把开始产蛋和即将产蛋的新母鸡处理掉。建议有关部门尽快解决鸡饲料不足的问题。
