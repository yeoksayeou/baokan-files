A Soviet economist has used newly released statistical data to show that the first and second five-year plans of the 1930s, which were announced to have been completed ahead of schedule and exceeded, were actually not completed. The pursuit of targets and deception that emerged at that time have had lasting consequences to this day.

Voshanov said that at the time, the top leader was overly ambitious, and the economic departments' leaders engaged in deception to curry favor, leading to many departments and regions experiencing imbalanced development, shortages of market goods, and a decline in foreign trade capabilities. The problems that existed in the Soviet economy at that time have not been overcome to this day.

　　最高领导好大喜功　经济部门弄虚作假    
    苏联头两个五年计划并未完成
    新华社莫斯科１月２２日电  苏联一位经济学家用新公布的统计材料说明，３０年代苏联宣布提前超额完成的第一、二个５年计划实际并未完成。当时出现的追求指标、弄虚作假等弊病的后果一直延续至今。
    沃夏诺夫说，当时最高领导人好大喜功，经济部门领导便弄虚作假，邀功请赏，导致许多部门和地区发展比例失调、市场商品紧缺、外贸能力下降。当时苏联经济存在的弊端至今未能克服。
