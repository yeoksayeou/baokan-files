    According to a report by the *Jerusalem Post*, Israeli Prime Minister Shamir said in an interview with the paper that he will propose a new Middle East peace plan during his meeting with the new U.S. President Bush in February or March.

    The report said that Shamir did not reveal the details of his new plan, but he still insists on opposing the current international trend of seeking a place for the Palestine Liberation Organization in the Middle East peace process.

    Shamir said he welcomes the help of UN Secretary-General Perez de Cuellar in arranging Middle East peace talks, but he opposes the UN's involvement in the peace talks, believing that the UN is "hostile to Israel."

    According to a report by a newspaper in the United Arab Emirates, Shamir's peace proposal aims to allow Palestinians in the occupied territories to have self-rule for a period of three years. After the three-year self-rule, the next phase of the Middle East peace process talks will be held, which will include the establishment of a tripartite federation of Israel, Jordan, and Palestine.

    沙米尔将提出中东和平新计划
    新华社开罗１月１３日电  据《耶路撒冷邮报》今天报道，以色列总理沙米尔在接受这家报纸采访时说，他在２月或３月会见美国新总统布什时将提出一项新的中东和平计划。
    报道说，沙米尔没有透露他新计划的详细内容，但他仍坚持反对当前在中东和平进程中出现的为巴勒斯坦解放组织争取一席之地的国际潮流。
    沙米尔说，他欢迎联合国秘书长德奎利亚尔帮助安排中东和平谈判，但他反对联合国卷入和平谈判，因为他认为联合国“对以色列怀有敌意”。
    据阿联酋一家报纸说，沙米尔的和平建议是打算允许被占领土的巴勒斯坦人实行为期３年的自治。３年自治以后再举行下一阶段的中东和平进程谈判，其内容将包括成立以色列、约旦和巴勒斯坦的三方邦联。
