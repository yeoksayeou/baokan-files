The capital garrison's military discipline and appearance were better last year than in previous years. According to a report from the capital garrison's military discipline and appearance, traffic safety summary meeting held this afternoon, the qualification rate for military discipline and appearance in 1988 was 87%, an increase of 13% compared to 1987.

Beijing is the political, economic, and cultural center of our country. The quality of the garrison's military discipline and appearance has a significant impact. To uphold the good image of the people's army, the garrison's various levels of party committees and leaders have paid high attention to this issue. Many units' leaders personally went to the grassroots level to conduct propaganda and inspections, strengthening the discipline and appearance of passing soldiers. The Beijing Garrison Command dispatched 100 inspectors to major bustling areas such as Xidan, Wangfujing, Beijing Railway Station, and Tiananmen Square to carry out supervision and inspections.

The capital garrison's traffic safety work also showed new progress. In 1988, a total of 318 traffic accidents occurred, a decrease of 34.6% compared to 1987. For three consecutive years, the Beijing Municipal Government has awarded the garrison the special traffic safety prize.

　　首都驻军军容风纪去年好于往年
    本报北京１月２８日讯  今天下午笔者从首都驻军军容风纪交通安全工作总结会上获悉：１９８８年，军容风纪合格率为８７％，比１９８７年上升１３％。
    北京是我国的政治、经济、文化中心。驻军军容风纪的好坏，影响重大。为树立人民军队的美好形象，驻京部队各级党委和领导高度重视，许多单位的领导亲自下基层，进行宣传检查，为加强过往军人的军容风纪纠察。北京卫戍区在西单、王府井、北京站、天安门广场等主要繁华场所派出了１００名纠察人员实施监督检查。
    首都驻军交通安全工作也有新的起色，１９８８年共发生交通事故３１８起，同１９８７年相比，减少３４．６％，连续三年被北京市政府授予交通安全特别奖。
