The National Bureau of Statistics recently conducted a survey of ten thousand workers on the issue of political system reform. The survey results indicate that the vast majority of workers support the separation of party and government functions, the improvement of democratic politics, and are confident in organizational reform.

Among nearly ten thousand valid responses, 57.6% of the participants believe that the separation of party and government functions is the key to political system reform; 29.5% believe that there are many issues with implementing the separation of party and government functions at present, and it should be handled with caution. The majority of workers hold a positive attitude towards the role of the party after the separation of party and government functions, with 70% of workers believing that the separation of party and government functions is beneficial to the party's own construction and enhancing the party's supervisory role.

The survey results also show that 62.7% of workers believe that increasing the openness of leadership activities and disclosing major situations to the public "helps to enhance citizens' democratic participation consciousness"; 5.2% of workers believe that this "will confuse people's minds and create new contradictions"; however, 27.2% of workers believe that increasing political transparency "has no practical effect."

The majority of workers are optimistic about organizational reform. The survey shows that 73.5% of workers believe that "organizational reform faces great difficulties and obstacles, but through exploration and effort, it can be successful." In the survey, 50.2% of workers believe that as long as this organizational reform "grasps the key of transforming organizational functions, it will necessarily succeed," while 11.9% of workers disagree with this view. 34.9% of workers responded with "I don't know," indicating that some workers still lack a correct understanding and awareness of the key to organizational reform.

　　国家统计局向万名职工问卷调查
    多数人对政治改革抱有信心
    新华社北京１月４日电  据中国统计信息报报道，国家统计局最近就政治体制改革问题向万名职工进行问卷调查。调查表明，绝大多数职工拥护党政分开、完善民主政治，对机构改革充满信心。
    在近万份有效答卷中，有５７．６％的人认为党政分开是政治体制改革的关键；２９．５％的人认为目前实行党政分开问题很多，需要谨慎对待。多数职工对党政分开后党的领导作用持肯定态度，７０％的职工认为党政分开有利于党的自身建设和提高党的监督作用。
    调查结果还表明，６２．７％的职工认为提高领导机关活动的开放程度，重大情况公布于众“有助于提高公民的民主参与意识”；认为“会搞乱人们思想，造成新的矛盾”的职工占５．２％；但有２７．２％的职工认为提高政治透明度“没有什么实际作用”。
    对机构改革多数职工表示乐观。调查显示，７３．５％的职工认为“机构改革困难和阻力很大，但经过探索和努力是可以成功的”。问卷调查中，有５０．２％的职工认为这次机构改革只要“抓住转变机构职能这个关键就必然成功”，不同意此看法的职工占１１．９％。有３４．９％的职工对此回答“不知道”，这表明部分的职工对机构改革的关键还缺乏正确的认识和理解。
