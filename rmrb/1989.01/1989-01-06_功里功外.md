Title: Inside and Outside of Practice

Three years ago, I went to the northwest on business and broke my leg bone. Although it healed and the skin returned to normal, every time it rains, my leg aches and feels numb. I heard that qigong can cure illnesses, so I became a student in the qigong class held in the small park near my home. The course lasted a month, with two hours of practice each day. I believe that qigong is a method of health preservation, physical exercise, and medical treatment. Imagine, if a person can eliminate all distractions, calm the mind, and balance the qi and blood, it must be beneficial for health. Being in the midst of lush trees, aligning with the natural laws of yin and yang, and harmonizing with the universe, this transcendent existence is truly a joy. Unfortunately, my heavy workload prevents me from attending the qigong classes every day. I practice three days and skip two, and in a month, I only managed to enjoy eight hours of transcendence. On rainy days, my leg still hurts. I think it's not that qigong is ineffective, but rather my own fault.

I decided to start over. I took another month's tuition fee to enroll again, but I happened to encounter an old couple arguing in the small park:

Husband: I still have things to do and no time for this.
Wife: You are already retired.
Husband: But I am still alive.
Wife: Practicing qigong will make you live longer.
Husband: Living means doing things.
Wife: If you die, you can't do anything!
Husband: I don't want to waste my time.
Wife: How is it wasting time? Didn't you hear that in Kunming, with one session of qigong, you can travel to Beijing in three hours? In Guangzhou, the instruments at Tsinghua University move with qigong?
Husband: I don't want to be a Taoist from Mount Lao. How ridiculous!
Wife: Are you better than Ye Shengtao? He didn't believe in psychic powers at first, but after seeing it with his own eyes, he finally admitted it, didn't he?
Husband: Did he see a magic trick? Such a miraculous national treasure, why not teach it to athletes to win gold medals? Otherwise, let the qigong masters perform on the sports field?
Wife: People like you, it's a wonder you haven't died yet!
Husband: Is it possible to live forever? That's only for alchemists and monks to play with, it's sad...
[At this time, many people gathered around, and they were all old people.]

Wife: Are you tired of living or what?
Husband: Death is a kind of balance. Some people have the time to practice qigong every day and live long lives, while others, such as a physicist dedicated to his work or an individual entrepreneur trying to make money, may die young because they don't have time for qigong. This cycle continues, idle people live longer because of qigong, and busy people die younger because they don't practice qigong, leading to an aging society. What kind of structure will that be? It's not just about revitalization, but even eating will become a problem.
Wife: You really want to die!
Husband: Death is also a duty...

At this point, the small park lost its tranquility, and the people who gathered began to argue and fight, eventually coming to blows... heads bleeding and people falling over, the old people who had practiced qigong were excited. They called the police.

My second attempt to enroll was thus foiled.

Another month passed, and I entered the small park near my home for the third time, of course, with the enrollment fee. The autumn leaves in the park were red, as red as blood. The atmosphere in the grove was solemn, like being in a temple. The old couple was also there, and the husband's qigong was even more profound than his wife's. He had a bandage on his forehead, probably from the punch he took last time. He didn't look up, but his wife glanced at me. The sensations of movement, itching, lightness, heaviness, coldness, warmth, dryness, and smoothness, known as the "eight abilities," all permeated my body at once, even though I hadn't learned to practice qigong yet. My leg was numb and painful, and I couldn't move—last night I forgot to watch the weather forecast on TV, but the sun was clearly shining above...

　　功里功外
    朱春雨
    三年前去西北出差摔折了腿骨，后来虽然长得皮肉如初，每遭阴天总是酸木失灵且隐隐作痛。听说气功可医，我便成了我家跟前小公园里的气功学习班上的一名学员，学期一个月，每日两小时。我相信气功是一种养生术、健身术、医疗术。试想，一个人排除诸多杂念，心安神宁气血平和，肯定是有利于健康的。身处枝叶扶疏的林间，生命法于阴阳和于术数，天人相应，这超脱的存在着实是一种享受。奈何繁重的工作使我不能保证每日的气功功课，三天打渔两天晒网，一个月里充其量我才在超脱的存在里享受了八小时，阴天时腿还疼，我想这不是气功不灵，实在是自己的过错。
    决心从头做起。我又带着一个月的学费去报名，偏遇上在小公园里一对老夫妻吵嘴：
    夫：我要做的事还没有做完，没时间搞这个。
    妻：你已经离休了。
    夫：可我还活着。
    妻：练练气功你就更长寿。
    夫：活着该做事。
    妻：死了，你什么也做不成！
    夫：我不愿白搭工夫。
    妻：怎叫白搭工夫？没听说在昆明一发功，仨钟头就到北京了？广州一发功，清华大学的仪表都在动。
    夫：我不想做崂山道士。可笑！
    妻：叶圣陶不如你？他原不承认特异功能，人家让他亲眼见了，临了还是服了不是？
    夫：他是不是看了个魔术？这么神的国粹，怎不教给运动员去夺金牌？要不然让气功大师往运动场上发功？
    妻：你这种人呀，不早死才怪呢！
    夫：想长生不老可能吗？那只有让炼丹术士和尚老道去作弄，这令人悲哀……
    ［这时围拢来许多人，而且都是老人。］
    妻：你活腻了还是怎么的？
    夫：死亡本是一种平衡。一些人有工夫每天发几次功而长寿，而另一些人，比方说一个忠于事业的物理学家或是一个想发财的个体户，很可能因为没有工夫做气功而短命，周而复始，闲人因做气功而长寿则越来越多，忙人则因不做气功而短命则越来越少，社会老龄化，成了什么样的结构？那别说振兴什么，就是吃饭也成问题。
    妻：你真是想寻死！
    夫：死也是义务……
    这时的小公园失去了安恬宁静，围拢上来的人参与了争吵、斗骂，最后动了手脚……头破血流人仰马翻，学过气功的老人们精神亢奋。他们招来了警察。
    我第二次报名因此告吹。
    又过了一个月，我第三次进了我家跟前的小公园，当然是带着报名费。公园里的秋叶正红，红得血一般。林间甬道上那“四禅八定”的气氛肃穆得如临一座神殿。那对老夫妻也在其间，而且老夫的功比老妻的功发得更瓷更深，他额上贴着胶布，大约上次挨拳的伤口还在。他没抬头，倒是他的老妻扫了我一眼。动、痒、轻、重、凉、热、涩、滑所谓“八能”的各种感觉，同时袭透全身，虽然我还没学会发功。腿又酸又木迈不动还隐隐作痛——昨晚忘记了看电视里的天气预报，可头顶分明悬着个太阳……　　（作者单位：第二炮兵政治部创作室）
