	The INF Treaty stipulates that the Soviet Union should destroy 889 medium-range missiles and 957 short-range missiles. During the same period, 212 launchers for these two types of missiles have also been destroyed.

	Soviet Deputy Foreign Minister Petrovsky said that the negotiations on reducing offensive strategic weapons have recently stalled due to the American side. The main issue is still the disagreement over the interpretation of the Anti-Ballistic Missile (ABM) Treaty.
