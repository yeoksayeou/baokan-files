Saying Goodbye to the Ledger, Sitting in Front of the Screen:
Daqing's 10 Billion Yuan in Assets Managed by Computer

Xinhua News Agency, Harbin, December 31, 1988 (Correspondent Wei Guozhi) Daqing Oilfield has achieved computer network information management for all 10.8 billion yuan in fixed assets. This is the first time in China's super-large enterprises.

In the past, Daqing Oilfield's massive fixed assets were managed manually using ledgers, cards, and folders, which was labor-intensive and inefficient, and could not meet the needs of modernizing the enterprise. In 1986, the asset management department of the oilfield decided to use a computer network for management. Nearly 500 professional personnel were organized to verify nearly 100,000 items of assets and 2.97 million data points across the entire oilfield. On this basis, they studied and formulated a scientific coding system for various types of fixed assets, achieving one code per item. In establishing the computer network, to fully utilize the existing different types of computers, they overcame difficulties such as heterogeneous machine networking, Chinese character simplification conversion, and industry-wide shared software, forming a specialized computer network with 54 factories (companies) as endpoints, covering an area of 2,300 square kilometers.

This network, after half a year of trial operation, proved that it can obtain various reports, documents, and data on fixed assets and asset finances, increasing efficiency by 12 to 960 times compared to manual management. It can also perform macro-analysis and predictions that manual management cannot, providing a scientific basis for determining the enterprise's future fixed asset investment directions and improving equipment utilization efficiency.

    大庆百亿巨资实现计算机管理
    新华社哈尔滨１９８８年１２月３１日电  （通讯员魏国志）大庆油田１０８亿固定资产全部实现计算机网络信息管理。这在我国特大型企业中尚属首次。
    大庆油田的巨额固定资产过去一直采用帐、卡、折等户口式人工管理，工作难度大，效率低，不能适应企业现代化建设的需要。１９８６年，油田资产管理部门决定用计算机网络进行管理，并组织近５００名专业人员对全油田近１０万项资产、２９７万项数据进行了核实。在此基础上，对各类固定资产研究编制了科学的编码系统，做到了一物一码。在建立计算机网络中，为充分利用现有的不同型号的计算机，他们攻克了异机种联网、汉字繁简字转换、各行业共用软件等难题，形成了一套以５４个厂（公司）为端点、覆盖面积２３００平方公里的专业化计算机网络。
    这套网络试运行半年证明，它可以获得固定资产和资产财务的各种报表、文件和数据，分别比人工管理提高１２倍到９６０倍。它还能进行人工管理无法进行的宏观分析预测，为确定企业今后的固定资产投资方向及提高设备使用效益提供科学依据。
