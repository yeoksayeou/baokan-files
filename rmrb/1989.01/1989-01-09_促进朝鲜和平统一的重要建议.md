	The beginning of the new year saw Chairman Kim Il Sung of the Workers' Party of Korea and the state leadership issue a New Year's Address, in which he solemnly proposed holding a political consultation conference in Pyongyang as soon as possible, attended by leaders from various parties and sectors of the North and South. Invitations were extended to the chairpersons of various parties in South Korea, including the Justice Party, the New Democratic Party, the Democratic Party, and the Republican Party, as well as prominent figures from various circles.

	This is another important proposal made by Chairman Kim Il Sung for the independent and peaceful reunification of the Korean Peninsula, which has attracted widespread attention from the Korean people and received increasing support from more and more countries around the world.

	Over the past year, the Workers' Party of Korea and the government of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea have, in order to ease tensions on the Korean Peninsula, achieve national reconciliation, and create favorable conditions for reunification, successively proposed holding joint conferences between the North and South, joint parliamentary conferences between the North and South, tripartite talks, high-level political and military talks between the North and South, sports talks, and student talks. In November last year, they proposed four principles for ensuring peace and a comprehensive peace plan. However, the current dialogue channels maintained between the North and South are limited to the meetings of parliamentary representatives from both sides to prepare for the joint parliamentary conference between the North and South. In the seven meetings held over the past four months, the representatives from both sides have only reached basic agreement on the form of the conference and have not made substantial progress. This reflects, on the one hand, the efforts made by the representatives from both sides, especially the Northern representatives, and on the other hand, it also indicates that this situation is still not sufficient to meet the needs of the developing situation.

	As early as 1980, Chairman Kim Il Sung proposed the plan to establish the Democratic Federal Republic of Koryo, providing the best solution for the reunification of Korea. Historical development has proven that this plan has strong vitality. The reunification of Korea is an inevitable trend of history and the will of the people. As long as the representatives from both the North and South have sincere intentions and sit down together to conduct serious dialogue and consultation under the condition of eliminating external interference, the goal of peaceful reunification of Korea will ultimately be successfully achieved.

　　促进朝鲜和平统一的重要建议
    周必忠
    新年伊始，朝鲜劳动党和国家领导人金日成主席在《新年辞》中，就朝鲜和平统一问题郑重提议尽快在平壤举行由北南各党派各界领导人参加的政治协商会议，并向南朝鲜朝野各党——民正党、平民党、民主党、共和党的总裁及各界知名人士发出了邀请。
    这是金日成主席为朝鲜自主和平统一祖国提出的又一项重要建议，已引起全体朝鲜人民的广泛注意，受到世界上越来越多国家的支持。
    去年以来，朝鲜劳动党和共和国政府为了缓和朝鲜半岛紧张局势、实现民族和解，为统一祖国创造有利条件，曾先后提出举行北南联席会议、北南国会联席会议、三方会谈、北南高级政治军事会谈、体育会谈、学生会谈等建议。去年１１月，又提出保障和平的四项原则和一揽子和平方案。但是，目前北南双方保持的对话渠道，仅有为北南国会联席会议作准备的双方国会代表的会晤。４个多月来，双方国会代表在７次会晤中，也仅在会议形式上基本达成协议，并没能取得实质性进展。这一方面反映了双方代表特别是北方代表所作的努力，另一方面也表明，这种状况尚不足以适应形势发展的需要。
    早在１９８０年，金日成主席就提出建立高丽民主联邦共和国的方案，为朝鲜的统一提出最佳的方案。历史发展证明，这一方案有着很强的生命力。朝鲜统一是历史所趋，人心所向。只要北南双方代表都抱有诚意，在排除外来干扰的条件下，坐在一起认真地进行对话和协商，朝鲜和平统一的目标，最终一定能圆满实现。
