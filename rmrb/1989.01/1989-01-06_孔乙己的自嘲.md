Kong Yiji's Self-Derision

Ah, I, old Kong, have been famous for over 70 years now. This fame has indeed been quite resounding. What's frustrating is that whenever people talk about me, they always bring up that incident in the Lu Town tavern where I reddened my face with those few arguments: “Stealing books can't be considered theft… stealing books!… A scholar's business, how can it be considered theft?” And then, just like those who mocked me back then, they would let out a few loud laughs.

I say, don't mock me anymore. For over 70 years, haven't you all found this matter a bit strange? Even I, old Kong, who knows the four different ways to write the character “return,” wouldn't really be unaware of the nuances between “steal” and “pilfer”? Whether it's “steal” or “pilfer,” aren't they both referring to taking someone's belongings without their knowledge? What's there to argue about? It's just that the implied meaning has been overlooked for too long.

Someone said that there are about eight thousand languages in the world, and one of the important indicators of how developed a language is, is to see how rich its synonyms are. By this standard, the Chinese language that we use is undoubtedly unparalleled in its development. Just take the matter of “death,” and you can list out: “decease, perish, bid farewell, expire, pass away, die, ascend to the heavens, kick the bucket,” and so on, a hundred or so words to choose from. This is the foundation of creating euphemistic language, and it also helps to promote the spirit of putting on makeup and committing suicide out of a desire to save face. Thus, when talking to a fool about an idiot, one can say, “He's not very smart.” But why is it that when mocking me, old Kong, you have to use the sharp and unpleasant word “steal”?

Ah, mock away, mock away. It's also my fault for being too hasty back then, grabbing the word “pilfer” to defend myself. If I had been more composed, I should have used the word “find” instead. “Finding books can't be considered theft… finding books!… A scholar's business, how can it be considered theft?” This way, it would sound much more pleasant than “stealing books” or “pilfering books.”

What? You want to mock me again? That's because you haven't seen much. Don't you all see how people are nowadays: building houses and finding bricks, making furniture and finding materials, picking up a camera and finding film, starting a motorcycle and finding oil, borrowing a book and finding (free) a copying machine, and collecting scrap iron on the road and finding manhole covers and water troughs; those who pluck feathers from a passing goose say “find,” those who casually take something say “find,” and even those who steal from their own say “find”…

So many ways of “finding,” so many people who are good at “finding,” aren't they all my, Kong Yiji's, disciples! Xunzi said: “The blue comes from the indigo, but it surpasses the indigo.” This saying is indeed reasonable. But I, old Kong, admit to “pilfer” rather than “steal,” at least there's a bit of honesty in that. What is this “find” anyway?!

Oh, right, there's another thing you all must know. There was a “Service for You” program that introduced a new method for preserving chimneys. It said that after washing the chimney with water, you should find some waste machine oil to apply. This really caused a stir. East, south, west, north, and the entire country suddenly started “finding” machine oil. As for where to “find” this oil and to what extent the “waste” oil is, these questions are hard to delve into.

So, what exactly is “find”? The explanation in the “Modern Chinese Dictionary” is: “To strive to see or obtain the person or thing one needs.” But people also have another tacit understanding: “Find” means to openly and honorably turn public property into private property. The strange thing is, no one goes to reveal this bottom line. Even linguists, when compiling synonym dictionaries, didn't notice that there's an equal sign between “find” and “steal.”

Ah, no wonder you all often mock me. I really should mock myself a bit.

　　孔乙己的自嘲
    葛栋玉
    唉，我老孔出名有７０多年了，这名儿，也出得梆梆价响。气恼的是，国人们每每谈起我来，常要絮叨我在鲁镇酒店里涨红脸的那几句争辩：“窃书不能算偷……窃书！……读书人的事，能算偷吗？”于是乎，如同当年取笑的人一样，要亮出几声格格的笑声。
    我说诸位莫再取笑，７０多年来，你们就不觉得这事儿有点蹊跷？就连“回”字有四种写法都了然的老孔，难道会真不晓得“偷”与“窃”的个中三味？“偷”也好，“窃”也罢，不都指的是趁人不知道拿人东西这种勾当么，这有什么说不清的。倒是那弦外之音，被列位忽视得太久了。
    有人说，地球上的人类语言约有八千种，而衡量一种语言发达不发达的重要标志之一，就是看看这种语言里的同义词丰富不丰富。照此说来，国人们使用的汉语，自然是发达得无与伦比了。单是“死”这件事儿，就可以列出：“亡、毙、永别、咽气、仙逝、呜呼、上西天、挺了腿”之类百十来个词儿供人挑拣。此乃创造委婉之语的基础，也有利于光大发扬搽粉上吊、死要面子的精神。于是乎，当着傻子谈呆子，可以说“他不大聪明”。为什么独独取笑我老孔时，就甩出个尖刻刺耳的“偷”字呢？！
    唉，取笑就取笑吧，也怪我当年口急了点，就抓了个“窃”字来挡牌。果能从容从容，请“找”字来才是上好的计策，“找书不能算偷，……找书！……读书人的事，能算偷吗？”如此一粉饰，较之“偷书”、“窃书”顺耳多了。
    什么？又要取笑，这可就是你少见多怪了。诸位不见现今的国人们：盖房子找砖，打家具找料，端上相机找胶卷，开起摩托找油，借了书去找（不花钱）复印机，收废铁的公路面上去找阴井盖儿笄水槽；雁过拔毛的说“找”，顺手牵羊的说“找”，监守自盗的也说“找”……
    如此之多的“找”样儿，如此之多的擅“找”的人儿，莫不都是我孔乙己的徒儿！荀子曰：青出于蓝而胜于蓝。此语不失至理。可我老孔不承认“偷”而承认“窃”，总还有一点坦诚劲儿，这“找”又算个什么阿物儿呢？！
    噢，对了，还有件事儿诸位想必也知道的。那是一个《为您服务》节目，曾向大家介绍过一种保存烟筒的新方法。说是把烟筒用水洗过后，找点废机油来涂上。这一下可真够瞧的，东南西北、举国上下顷刻之间都在“找”机油，至于这油到哪里去“找”，“找”来的油又“废”到什么程度，这些话茬儿可就不好再刨根问底了。
    说破底，究竟什么叫做“找”呢？《现代汉语词典》的解释是：“为了要见到或得到所需求的人或事物而努力”。但国人们也另有一种心照不宣的解释说：“找”，就是大大方方体面风光地把公有的物儿化为私有。蹊跷的是，大家谁也不去把这谜底儿说破。就连语言学家们，去编同义词典类辞书，也没能注意到那“找”和“偷”之间，还有一个相似形的等号。
    唉，难怪诸位常要拿我取笑了，我也着实应该自我嘲笑一番了。
