The ancient city walls of Beijing are gradually disappearing, but a new "wall" is quietly taking shape. Aerial remote sensing data shows that between the Third and Fourth Ring Roads of Beijing, there are over 4,500 garbage mountains, each with a volume of more than 50 cubic meters, covering an area of over 7,000 acres. Smaller garbage piles are innumerable, forming a ring around the city. Some people jokingly call it the "Garbage Great Wall."

In reality, at least two-thirds of China's 380-plus cities are already surrounded by garbage.

In recent years, with the rapid increase in urban population, the expansion of construction scale, the rapid development of industrial production, and the continuous improvement of residents' living standards, the amount of urban solid waste (divided into three categories: domestic waste, industrial waste, and construction waste) has been increasing at a rate of 10% per year. According to statistics, the annual amount of domestic waste in cities nationwide is approximately 60 million tons, double the amount from ten years ago. In Shanghai, the city produces about 8,000 tons of domestic waste daily, in addition to 3,000 tons of construction waste, 7,500 tons of sewage, and 22,000 tons of industrial waste. The total amount of waste produced in Shanghai daily is 40,000 tons, or approximately 15 million tons annually, the highest in the country. If one ton is calculated as one cubic meter in volume, it can be piled into 360 twelve-story high-rise buildings.

Can we break through the "Garbage Great Wall"? Faced with the increasing threat of garbage, traditional garbage disposal methods have become outdated, and finding new solutions is urgent.

Unfortunately, in China's urban construction, solid waste management has long been excluded from urban planning. Although the state has increased financial allocations for urban sanitation in recent years, it still falls far short of meeting the needs of sanitation management. Sanitation facilities are outdated, and sanitation vehicles are severely insufficient, making it impossible for many cities to achieve daily disposal of garbage.

Even in a large city like Beijing, there is not a single garbage treatment plant. Nationwide, the rate of harmless treatment of garbage is less than 5% on average. Large amounts of untreated garbage can only be piled up in the suburbs, leading to the current situation where garbage surrounds the cities. The method of simply dumping garbage only moves it once. As a result, large amounts of land are occupied, affecting agricultural production. More seriously, it provides a breeding ground for mosquitoes and flies, endangering public health and causing endless harm.

It is understood that the current methods used abroad for garbage disposal include landfill, composting, and incineration.

Landfill methods include general landfill and sanitary landfill. The latter involves using a waterproof bottom layer, layering the garbage, compacting it, and covering the top layer with soil, allowing the garbage to ferment under anaerobic conditions to achieve harmless treatment. The United States mainly uses this method. Composting utilizes microorganisms to metabolize and decompose organic matter in garbage under high temperatures to achieve harmless treatment and can produce organic fertilizer. Incineration uses high temperatures to incinerate garbage, achieving complete harmless treatment. The residual ash is only about 10% of the original garbage, occupying a smaller area, and the final disposal of the residual ash is also relatively simple. It can also generate electricity and heat.

Experts have noted that the composition of urban garbage in China is as follows: coal ash accounts for 56%, vegetables and perishable items account for 36%, and combustible materials account for only 5%. They believe that, given these characteristics, sanitary landfill is a relatively economical and suitable technology. Its cost is one-third of composting and one-tenth of incineration, and its operating costs are the lowest. For example, if landfill gas is recovered, it can recover 25% of the biological energy resources in urban garbage. Moreover, the residual ash from incineration and the screened residue from composting are usually also treated by sanitary landfill. Therefore, sanitary landfill is the ultimate method for urban garbage treatment. Experts say that if eight to ten landfill sites with a daily capacity of 2,000 to 3,000 tons of garbage, each usable for more than 10 years, can be built and used cyclically, it would meet Beijing's permanent sanitary landfill requirements.

In addition to this method, due to the high proportion of organic matter in urban garbage in China, high-temperature composting should also play an important role in garbage treatment. Applying garbage compost to farmland is a good tradition in China. In recent years, due to farmers' extensive use of chemical fertilizers, the application amount has exceeded the world average, causing soil compaction and a decline in soil fertility, which has become a major hidden danger in China's agricultural production. The state has made it a policy to adjust the fertilizer structure and use more organic fertilizers.

However, experts believe that in the future, with the transformation of the fuel structure from coal to gas and electricity, the food structure from unprocessed vegetables and poultry to finished and semi-finished products, and the consumption structure from frugal to wasteful, the composition of urban garbage will gradually change. China should gradually establish a "classified collection, separate treatment" garbage treatment system; that is, change the current mixed collection and transportation of garbage, set up classified garbage bins in residential areas or enterprises, and produce different types of garbage bags. Implement bagged garbage and classified disposal, and then carry out classified treatment. This is an ideal solution.

In Shenzhen, 90% of households have implemented bagged garbage, achieving good results.

The garbage problem affects every household, and only when the whole society cooperates in garbage treatment can this problem be solved. Japan distributes 16,000 copies of a picture book titled "Let's Clean Up Together" to kindergartens every year, and includes articles on garbage treatment in the fourth-grade textbooks. Additionally, it organizes citizens to visit garbage treatment plants to enhance environmental awareness. Therefore, in Japan, many citizens voluntarily classify their garbage.

The encirclement of the "Garbage Great Wall" is expanding and has drawn increasing attention from the Chinese people.

It is understood that during the "Seventh Five-Year Plan" period, the state will allocate 3 billion yuan for the comprehensive utilization and treatment of solid waste. Moreover, a general policy has been introduced: comprehensive planning, reasonable layout, comprehensive utilization, turning harm into benefit, relying on the masses, everyone participating, protecting the environment, and benefiting the people.

Whether the "Garbage Great Wall" can be destroyed will be a test for us.

### 我们能冲破“垃圾长城”吗？

　　我们能冲破“垃圾长城”吗？
    江融
    北京的古城墙正在日益减少，然而，一座新的“城墙”又悄悄地形成。航空遥感资料显示，在北京三、四环路之间，５０立方米以上的垃圾山有４５００多座，占地逾７０００亩，小垃圾堆则数不胜数，已形成环状包围着城区。有关人士戏称为“垃圾长城”。
    实际上，中国３８０多个城市中，至少有２／３都已陷入垃圾的重围。
    近几年来，随着城市人口的大量增长，建设规模迅速扩大，工业生产的高速发展和居民消费水平的不断提高，城市固体废弃物（分为生活垃圾、工业垃圾和建筑垃圾三大类）每年也以１０％的速度激增，据统计，全国城市生活垃圾一年约达６０００万吨，比十年前增加了一倍。在上海，市区日产生活垃圾约８０００吨，此外，还有３０００多吨建筑垃圾，７５００吨粪便，以及２２０００吨工业垃圾，四项总和，上海一天产４万吨垃圾，一年约１５００万吨，居全国城市之首。若一吨按１立方米体积计算，能堆成３６０幢十二层的高层建筑。
    我们能冲出“垃圾长城”吗？面对垃圾量不断增加的威胁，传统的垃圾处理办法已经过时，寻找新办法已迫在眉睫。
    遗憾的是，在我国城市建设中，固体废弃物管理长期以来没有被纳入城建规划。尽管近几年来，国家不断增加城市环卫的财政开支，但仍远远无法满足环卫管理的需要。环卫设施陈旧，环卫车辆严重不足，使许多城市的垃圾无法做到日产日清。
    偌大的北京至今仍无一座垃圾处理厂。至于全国，垃圾无害化处理率平均不到５％，大量未经处理的垃圾只能裸堆在城郊，由此形成了目前垃圾包围城市的境况。一倒了之的处理方法，只是给垃圾搬了一次“家”。其结果，占用大量土地，影响农业生产。更为严重的是，它给蚊蝇提供了一个孳生场所，危害公众健康，祸害无穷。
    据悉，目前国外处理垃圾通用填埋法、堆肥法和焚烧法。
    填埋法分一般填埋和卫生填埋。后者是采用底层防渗，垃圾分层填埋，压实后顶层覆盖土层，使垃圾在厌氧条件下发酵，以达到无害化处理。美国主要采用这种方法。堆肥法是利用微生物对垃圾中有机物进行代谢分解，在高温下达到无害化处理，并能产生有机肥料。焚烧法则是利用高温焚化垃圾，无害化彻底，其残渣的重量仅为原生垃圾的１０％左右，占地面积较小，残渣的最终处置也较为简单，并能产生电能和热能。
    专家已经注意到，我国城市垃圾的成分：煤灰占５６％，蔬菜及易腐物占３６％，可燃物只占５％。他们认为，鉴于这些特点，卫生填埋法是较为经济、适用的技术。它的成本是堆肥的１／３，焚烧的１／１０，操作费用也最低：如采用填埋产沼气，可回收城市垃圾中１／４的生物能资源。而且，焚烧法处理垃圾所产生的残渣和堆肥法处理产生的筛余物，通常也用卫生填埋法进行最后处理，所以，卫生填埋法是城市垃圾处理的最终办法。专家说，若能建成八至十处日容量为二三千吨垃圾、可连续使用１０多年的填埋场，并循环使用，就能满足北京市的永久性卫生填埋要求。
    除此法之外，由于我国城市垃圾成分中有机物所占比重较高，高温堆肥处理法也应在我国的垃圾处理中占重要位置。垃圾堆肥施于农田，本来就是我国的优良传统。近几年由于农民大量施用化肥，施用量超过世界平均水平，造成土地板结、地力下降，已成为我国农业生产的一大潜在危险。国家已把调整用肥结构、多用有机肥作为一项方针来抓。
    但是，专家们认为，今后，随着燃料结构由煤转换为煤气和电力，食品结构由未加工的蔬菜、家禽转为成品和半成品，消费结构由节俭型转为废弃型，城市垃圾中的成分将逐渐发生变化，我国应逐步建立一个“分类收集、分别处理”的垃圾处理体系；即改变目前垃圾混合收运的状况，在居民点或企事业单位设立分类垃圾筒，并生产不同类别的垃圾袋，实行垃圾袋装，分类投放，然后进行分类处理。这是一种理想的解决办法。
    深圳市９０％住户已实行垃圾袋装，取得良好的效果。
    垃圾问题涉及千家万户，只有当全社会对垃圾处理工作进行合作，这个问题才有可能得到解决。日本每年向幼儿园发放１６０００册题为《让我们一道来打扫卫生》的小人书，在小学四年级的课本中，便有关于处理垃圾的文章。另外，还组织市民去垃圾处理厂参观，以增强国民的环境意识。因此，在日本，许多市民已主动将垃圾进行分类。
    “垃圾长城”的包围圈正在扩大，已引起国人的日益关注。
    据悉，“七五”期间，国家将拿出３０亿元资金用于固体废弃物的综合利用和治理。而且，一条总方针已出台，即：全面规划、合理布局、综合利用、化害为利、依靠群众、大家动手、保护环境、造福人民。
    “垃圾长城”能否摧毁，将是对我们自己的一个考验。
