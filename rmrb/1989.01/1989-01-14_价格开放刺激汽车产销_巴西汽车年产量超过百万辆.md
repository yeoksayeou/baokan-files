Price Liberalization Stimulates Car Production and Sales

Brazil's Annual Car Production Exceeds One Million Vehicles

		Our reporter Lan Cai Ji reports from Brasilia, January 13th: According to the Brazilian National Automobile Manufacturers Association, Brazil's national automobile production in 1988 reached 1,069,000 vehicles, surpassing the highest record since 1981. The domestic market sold 746,800 vehicles throughout the year, a 28.7% increase from the previous year. Exports amounted to 320,300 vehicles, and together with the export of 10,600 tractors, foreign exchange earnings amounted to $3.16 billion.

		Brazil's automobile industry was almost entirely developed through the introduction of foreign capital and technology. However, the current level of domestic production of automobile parts has reached over 95%. In the late 1970s and early 1980s, Brazil's annual automobile production exceeded one million vehicles. Later, due to the impact of the economic crisis, production declined, dropping to around 700,000 vehicles per year. To revitalize the automobile industry, the Brazilian government implemented a price liberalization policy in 1988, allowing automobile companies to adjust their selling prices based on production costs, resulting in a higher rate of price increases compared to the monthly inflation rate. This made production profitable, leading to a rapid expansion in production and investment, quickly reversing the downturn in the automobile industry.

		Brazil's price liberalization policy also stimulated the automobile sales market. Under the conditions of a lower price index and savings deposit interest rates compared to the rate of vehicle price increases, consumers rushed to buy cars, creating a "car-buying frenzy" in Brazil.

		As automobile production and sales rebounded, major global automobile companies such as Ford, Volkswagen, Mercedes-Benz, and Fiat, which have subsidiaries in Brazil, are all competing to expand their investments.

　　价格开放刺激汽车产销
    巴西汽车年产量超过百万辆
    本报巴西利亚１月１３日电  记者兰才基报道：据巴西全国汽车生产者协会宣布，１９８８年巴西全国汽车产量达到１０６．９万辆，突破１９８１年以来的最高纪录，国内市场全年销售汽车，７４．６８万辆，比前年增长２８．７％，出口３２．０３万辆，加上拖拉机出口１．０６万辆，创外汇收入３１．６亿美元。
    巴西汽车工业几乎全部是依靠引进外资和外国技术设备发展起来的，但目前汽车零部件国产化的指数已达９５％以上。在７０年代末和８０年代初，巴西汽车年产量已超过１００万辆，后来由于受经济危机的冲击，产量有所下降，曾下跌到年产７０多万辆。巴西政府为了推动汽车工业回升，去年采取了价格开放政策，允许各汽车公司可以根据生产成本提高销售价格，使车价的上涨率高于每月的通货膨胀率。这样一来，生产商感到有利可图，急剧扩大生产和投资，很快改变了汽车业不景气的面貌。
    巴西价格开放政策也活跃了汽车销售市场。在物价指数和储蓄存款利率低于车辆价格上涨幅度的形势下，消费者都急于购车，使巴西出现一股“买车热”。
    在汽车生产和销售再度兴旺起来的时候，在巴西设有子公司的福特、大众、奔驰和菲亚特等世界各大汽车公司都争相扩大投资。
