Jiangxi has taken measures to rectify the economic environment and order, firmly implementing and carrying out the central government's various measures for economic rectification and control. This has effectively curbed overheated economic development, and initial results have been achieved in the rectification and control efforts.

	•	Cleaning up fixed assets and ongoing projects, and reducing the scale of investment. By the end of last year, a total of 499 projects had been halted or delayed, reducing investment by 680 million yuan.

	•	The growth rate of loans has significantly decreased, and savings deposits have increased. Since the fourth quarter of last year, the balance of various bank loans has grown by 0.5% compared to the same period last year, which is much lower than the 41.2% growth rate in the first three quarters. The net increase in savings deposits for urban and rural residents in the fourth quarter was 775 million yuan, a 71.4% increase over the same period last year.

	•	The overly high industrial growth rate began to decline starting in October last year. The industrial growth rate in the fourth quarter was about 5% lower than in the first three quarters, while economic efficiency improved further. Last year, the province's realized profits and taxes increased by 24% compared to the previous year, and local fiscal revenue increased by over 400 million yuan.

	•	The market has shown signs of stabilization. Starting in October, the retail price index began to fall below the September increase, reversing the previous upward trend.

	•	The growth of consumption funds and social purchasing power have both been controlled.
