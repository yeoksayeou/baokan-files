A batch of outstanding talents in Hubei have been appointed as department-level officials.

According to Xinhua News Agency in Wuhan on January 15th, a batch of mid-level cadres from Hubei Provincial Direct Departments have been selected and promoted to department-level officials after undergoing public evaluation and personal self-reporting.

The Provincial Economic Commission, Urban and Rural Construction Department, Pharmaceutical General Company, and 10 other units, in the process of publicly recommending department-level leaders, emphasized the two aspects of democratic recommendation and organizational evaluation. They implemented the public disclosure of six items: selection positions, candidate qualifications, recommendation methods, basic information of candidates, recommendation results, and evaluation objects. They listened to the opinions of the masses from multiple angles and levels regarding the evaluated objects.

The democratic recommendation and open evaluation involving the public have allowed some outstanding talents to stand out. The former deputy director of the Production Department of Hubei Provincial Pharmaceutical General Company, Zhu Changhao, is very familiar with production line technology and management. He often goes to the grassroots level to help enterprises solve problems. In the first round of voting, due to his self-reporting speech and work achievements being evident to all, he won a clear advantage in votes. In the second round of individual consultations with mid-level cadres, he again ranked at the top and was eventually promoted to deputy manager (deputy department-level). According to statistics, among the first batch of department-level officials appointed this time, the average age is 44.2 years, and all have a bachelor's degree or higher.

　　群众参与考核　本人认真述职
　　湖北一批优秀人才担任厅局级干部
    据新华社武汉１月１５日电  （记者方政军、通讯员向从贵）湖北省直机关的一批中层干部经过群众参与考核和本人的述职，最近被择优选拔为厅局级干部。
    省经济委员会、城乡建设厅、医药总公司等１０个单位在进行公开推荐厅局级领导干部中，着重在民主推荐和组织考核两个环节上实行选任职位、人选条件、推荐方法、干部基本情况、推荐结果、考核对象六个公开，多方面、多层次地听取群众对被考核对象的意见。
    群众参与的民主推荐和公开考核，使一些优秀人才脱颖而出。原湖北省医药总公司生产处副处长朱长浩，对生产一线的生产技术、管理十分熟悉，而且经常下基层为企业排忧解难，在第一轮投票中，由于他的述职演说和工作政绩有目共睹，得票获明显压倒优势，在第二轮个别征求中层干部意见时，又名列前茅，最后被破格选任为副经理（副厅级）。据统计，在这次任命的第一批厅局级干部中，平均年龄为４４．２岁，全部具有大专以上文化程度。
