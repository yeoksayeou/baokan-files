Over the past two years, the Rehabilitation Association of the China Disabled Persons' Welfare Foundation has organized nearly 100 experts and professors specializing in polio to travel to Shanxi, Yunnan, Fujian, Shaanxi, and other regions. They have performed corrective surgeries on more than 2,000 polio patients, with an effective rate of over 95%.

According to statistics, China currently has more than 3 million polio survivors, the majority of whom are young adults in their 20s and 30s. Many of these patients, especially those in economically underdeveloped, remote, and medically underserved areas, have long been unable to receive treatment.

Since November 1986, the Rehabilitation Association of the China Disabled Persons' Welfare Foundation has organized medical teams in seven batches to travel to Shanxi and other regions to perform surgeries for patients. In Fujian, one patient was so overjoyed after the surgery that he wrote seven or eight letters in a day to inform his relatives and friends, "From now on, I can stand up!"

To promote this work, the Rehabilitation Association of the China Disabled Persons' Welfare Foundation has established the Polio Rehabilitation Research Society.

　　专家教授赴山西等地施行矫治手术
    二千小儿麻痹后遗症患者直立行走了
    据新华社北京１月４日电  中国残疾人福利基金会康复协会近两年来先后组织近百名小儿麻痹症专家、教授，到山西、云南、福建、陕西等地，为２０００多名小儿麻痹患者施行矫治手术，有效率达９５％以上。
    据统计，我国现有小儿麻痹后遗症患者３００多万人，多数是二三十岁的青年人。这些患者，特别是处在经济落后、交通不便、医疗条件较差地区的患者，长期以来得不到治疗。
    自１９８６年１１月以来，中国残疾人福利基金会康复协会组织医疗队，分７批到山西等地为患者实施手术，福建有位病人在手术治疗后，高兴得一天写了七八封信，告诉亲友们说：“从今以后我能站起来了！”
    为推动这一工作，中国残疾人福利基金会康复协会还成立了小儿麻痹后遗症康复研究会。
