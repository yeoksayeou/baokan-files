Since Beijing began reforming its enterprise employment system, labor markets have emerged in response. Currently, there are 14 such markets in the city. The labor market in Xicheng District, located within Yuetan Park, has been operating since last January. It has worked tirelessly to facilitate job transfers among enterprises and to help unemployed youth find employment.

Every Friday, the market is bustling with activity. Statistics show that over the past year, more than 4,000 people have found new jobs or satisfactory positions through this market. Out of 310 enterprises seeking workers, the needs of more than 260 have been met.

Of course, there are also concerns. The friction between old and new systems, the influence of traditional ideas, and the lack of coordinated reforms have all made the selection process difficult for both parties. According to recent statistics from the Xicheng District Labor Market, nearly 4,000 employed workers have come to the market for consultations and expressed a desire to transfer, but fewer than 2% have actually gone through with the process.

Invisible Shackles

Despite being prominently displayed at the labor market, the recruitment notice for the Tire Factory has been largely ignored. The factory is known for its good economic performance throughout the city. However, their employment system still follows old rules: "New employees must first undergo a six-month probation period, followed by a three-year apprenticeship. Only in the fourth year, if performance is good, will they receive a monthly salary of 40 yuan."

This "long-suffering bride" approach is hard to accept today. We observed that some job seekers, after hesitating in front of the factory's recruitment notice, quickly shifted their attention to notices from joint ventures or wholly foreign-owned enterprises.

The Tire Factory's recruitment staff shrugged helplessly, "What can we do? The apprenticeship period is mandated by the state. In fact, many young workers, after pre-employment training, can handle their jobs in just four or five months, not four or five years. If the compensation doesn't reflect the value of labor, what attraction does the enterprise have? Look, joint ventures and wholly foreign-owned enterprises are thriving because they don't have so many restrictions."

Last January, Beijing issued a "Regulation on the Flow of Workers in Enterprises," which placed certain restrictions on the transfer of workers in key positions to ensure the rational flow of labor. This is understandable. However, some enterprises have used this as an excuse to expand the scope of key positions, aiming to pin workers down like nails in their own enterprises. Some enterprises have even included positions like drivers, salespersons, and restaurant service staff as "key" positions. We learned from the labor market management office that over the past year, 200 workers came to the labor market to appeal for transfers, but 80% of them were unable to move due to the various restrictions imposed by their enterprises.

How to create equal competition conditions between enterprises and between workers, and achieve the optimal combination of labor and production resources? The staff at the labor market say, "It depends on further improving relevant regulations and providing necessary relaxation in policies."

What Keeps People?

"Those who move are not good people, good people do not move. If I need someone, I won't come to the labor market, and the labor market won't get my people." Some enterprise leaders respond this way to workers who request transfers. We encountered many workers who joyfully took one foot into the labor market, only to disappointedly find that the other foot was still tightly bound by the enterprise.

One worker showed us their company's "Regulations on Job Transfers for Employees": "You tell me, is this 'promoting the rational flow of workers'—anyone requesting a transfer must leave the company within three months from the date of application, otherwise, their salary will be stopped, and only food subsidies will be issued; before transferring, all items and housing must be handed over to the relevant departments, otherwise, the labor department will not handle the transfer; for technical workers requesting a transfer, a swap procedure will be implemented, and only after a worker of equal technical level is transferred in, can the transfer out be processed—isn't this a threat and warning to those requesting transfers?"

We were speechless. In the crowd, a driver from a certain repair company shared his troubles with us. He lives in Chaoyang District but works in Xicheng District. He spends an unknown amount of time commuting every day and can't do anything at home. For this reason, he applied for a transfer. The company leader replied, "You can leave if you want, but you must find a 'radish' to fill your spot."

This driver found five colleagues of similar age and skills, but was still rejected by the labor department head: "The driver you found is one year older and has one year less driving experience, which does not meet the requirements, so the transfer will not be processed for now."

It is not difficult to see that these examples illustrate the lack of understanding by these enterprise leaders regarding the significance of personnel mobility. They should really sit down and think: In a market economy, enterprises face competition from all sides. What can they do to unite the workforce?

The Gap Between Supply and Demand

A few odd-looking young men walked into the labor market, standing out in the bustling crowd of job seekers. They wandered around a few recruitment booths, saying, "Uncle, we have a few people left, but we just need a 'public medical certificate' to find a job with you. What do you think?" Naturally, no recruitment unit was interested in them.

Most units applying for workers at the labor market require the recruitment of 16-21-year-old fresh graduates from junior or senior high school, as well as technicians with skills such as electrician, machinist, and fitter. Many units also state that they do not want older youth and delinquent youth. However, according to a survey by the Xicheng District Labor Market, among the youth participating in the talks, those under 21 are few, and fresh graduates are even fewer; there are more skilled workers, and even more women workers without skills, as well as a certain number of delinquent youth. The gap in conditions between the supply and demand of labor is so large, making it difficult to form a "good match."

The labor market tells young people that to win in the job competition, they must aim at the social demand for labor, strive to learn one or two skills, and narrow the gap with the demand side. The labor market should also timely report social employment information to people, guiding them to make correct choices based on reality.

May the labor market become a lively pool in the social exchange of labor.

　　双向选择的困扰
    ——来自北京西城区劳务市场的报告
    王振良　赵剑平　颜世贵
    自从北京市开始对企业用工制度进行改革，应运而生的劳务市场相继问世，目前全市已有１４家劳务市场。设在月坛公园内的西城区劳务市场，自去年１月开张以来，为企业间的职工流动、社会待业青年的就业，付出了辛勤的汗水。
    每到星期五，这里人流涌动，熙来攘往。据统计，过去的一年，通过这个劳务市场，已有４０００余人愉快地走上了新的岗位或找到了称心的工作；３１０个申请用工的单位中，２６０多个单位的需求得到满足。
    当然，喜中也有忧。新旧体制的摩擦，传统观念的影响，加之改革的不配套等等，致使双方选择步履艰难。据前不久西城区劳务市场的统计，近４０００名在职工人到市场咨询，要求流动，而真正办了手续的不足２％。
    　　　　无形的捆绑
    轮胎厂的招工告示，尽管挂在劳务市场的显眼处，还是被冷在一旁。这个厂以其较好的经济效益在全市闻名。可是，他们的用工制度却有旧规：“进厂先来个半年试用期，接着又是３年学徒期，第４年表现好了才能拿到４０元月工资。”
    这种“多年媳妇熬成婆”的办法，在今天势必难以接受。我们在现场看到，一些求职者在这个厂的招工简章前徘徊一阵之后，立即将目光转向了合资企业或独资企业的招工告示。
    轮胎厂招工人员无可奈何地摇摇头说：“我们有啥法子？学徒期是国家规定的。其实，很多青工经过就业前培训，别说四五年，有的仅四五个月就能胜任本职。报酬不能体现劳动价值，企业还有什么吸引力？瞧，人家合资和独资企业红火，就是因为没有那么多的框框。”
    去年１月，北京市下发了一个《关于企业工人流动的若干规定》，对关键性岗位的工人流动作了某些限制，以保证劳动力的合理流向。这无可非议。可是，有些企业却借机扩大关键性岗位的范围，以期把绝大多数工人像钉子一样钉在自己的企业里。有些企业甚至把汽车司机、售货员、餐厅服务员等也都列入了“关键性”岗位。我们从劳务市场管理处了解到，这一年，就有２００名工人找到劳务市场，提出要求流动的申诉，但８０％的工人，由于企业设下的条条框框而动弹不得。
    如何创造企业与企业之间、劳动者与劳动者之间平等的竞争条件，实现劳动力与生产资料的最佳结合？劳务市场的同志说：“有赖于进一步完善有关规定，在政策上给予必要的松绑。”
    　　　　靠什么留住人
    “流动没好人，好人不流动，要人我不找劳务市场，劳务市场也别想我的人。”有些企业领导人这样答复提出流动的工人。我们在市场上接触到，好多工人往往高兴地一只脚迈进劳务市场，又扫兴地发现另一脚仍被企业死死地捆着。
    一位工人将他们公司的《关于职工调动工作的规定》条款拿给我们看：“你们说，这能叫‘促进工人的合理流动’——凡要求调动的同志从申请调动之日起，限３个月调出本公司，逾期不调出者停发本人工资，只发副食补贴；办理调动手续之前必须向有关部门交齐各类物品及住房，否则劳动科不予办理调动手续；对要求调出的技术工人实行对调程序，将使技术级别相等的工人调进后，方可办理调出手续——这不是对要求流动人员的威胁与警告吗？”
    我们无语。在人流中，某修理公司一位司机向我们诉说了他的苦恼。他家住朝阳区，人在西城区上班。每天花费在路上的时间不知多少，家里的事一点不能做。为此而申请流动。公司领导回答说：“想调走可以，但必须找个‘萝卜’来顶你的坑。”
    这位司机先后找了５位年龄相仿、技术相当的同行，最后还是在劳动科长那里卡了壳：“找来的司机年龄比你大１岁，驾龄比你短１年，不合要求，暂不办理调离手续。”
    不难看出，这些事例足以说明这些企业领导缺乏对其人员流动意义的理解，实在应该静下心来深思一下：在商品经济的条件下，企业面临着各方面的竞争，靠什么凝聚职工队伍？
    　　　　需求双方差距悬殊
    几个怪模怪样的男青年走进劳务市场，在熙熙攘攘的求职人流中，显得异常扎眼。他们在几个招工摊位前晃来晃去，说：“大叔，钱，咱剩几个，只缺个‘公费医疗证’，到你们那里找碗饭吃，你看怎么样？”自然，没有哪个招工单位看上他们。
    到劳务市场申请用工的单位，大都要求招收１６—２１岁的应届初、高中毕业生，以及具有电工、车工、钳工等专长的技术工人。许多单位还声明不要大龄青年和失足青年。但是，据西城区劳务市场调查发现，参加洽谈会的青年中，２１岁以下的少，应届毕业生更少；熟练工多，没有技术的女工更多，另外还有一定数量的失足青年。劳动力供需双方的条件差距，如此悬殊，当然难以缔结“良缘”。
    劳务市场的行情告诉青年人，要想在就业竞争中取胜，必须瞄准社会劳动力需求形势，努力学会一至两门技术，缩小与需方的差距。劳务市场则要及时向人们通报社会用工信息，引导他们从实际出发，作出正确的选择。
    但愿劳务市场成为社会劳务交流中的一潭活水。
