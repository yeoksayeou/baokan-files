Among the more than 800,000 rural households in Changchun City, Jilin Province, 790,000 households have now installed energy-saving stoves, saving 10 million tons of firewood annually.

This type of energy-saving stove has a reasonable structure and is equipped with side or co-directional ventilation devices. The firewood burns completely, concentrating the heat source and improving thermal efficiency. A family of four to five people only needs 2 kilograms of firewood to cook a meal, saving half the firewood compared to the old-style stove. Previously, the main fuel for Changchun rural households was straw. Now, the saved corn stalks can be used to feed cattle, return to the field through digestion, and be used for fertilizing the soil.

　　长春近八十万农户用上省柴灶
    据新华社长春电  吉林省长春市农村八十多万农户中，目前已有七十九万户用上了节柴灶，一年可节柴一百万吨。
    这种节柴灶结构合理，加上侧向或同向通风设备，燃点集中，柴火达到完全燃烧，热效率高。一个四至五口之家，做一顿饭只用二公斤柴，比过去老式灶省柴一半。以往主要靠秸秆烧火的长春农户，现在可把节省的玉米秸秆用来喂牛、过腹还田和积肥还田。
