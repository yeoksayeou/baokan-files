Brazil's President Sarney announced on January 15 a reform plan aimed primarily at controlling inflation. This plan, known as the "Summer Plan," is the third major economic reform initiative undertaken by the Sarney administration.

The main features of the "Summer Plan" include simultaneous administrative and economic reforms. In terms of administrative reform, the 27 federal ministries will be streamlined and merged into 22 ministries, and 42 federal agencies will be abolished. It is reported that with these mergers and abolitions, over 60,000 federal employees will be laid off. The government also plans to sell shares of state-owned enterprises to accelerate the privatization process.

In the economic realm, the primary focus is on adjusting the current price and wage policies. Starting from January 16, prices nationwide will be frozen, followed by gradual adjustments. The prices of essential goods for residents will be set by the government, with strict market supervision. The new wage policy will be jointly formulated by the government, labor, and management through a "social agreement." In the future, the total amount of government expenditure on public sector salaries will not exceed 65% of government revenue. Private enterprises are encouraged to adjust wages through negotiations between labor and management.

The reform plan also involves the national fiscal system and monetary policy, such as prohibiting the government from issuing bonds to cover fiscal deficits, increasing bank loan and savings deposit interest rates, and issuing new currency "New Cruzado," with a 1:1000 exchange rate with the old currency. The new currency will be devalued by 17%, making its current exchange rate with the US dollar 1:1.

The Brazilian government's "Summer Plan" was proposed amid worsening inflation. Last year, Brazil's inflation rate reached 933%, and there is a trend of further deterioration this year. Due to the worsening inflation, economic development has been hindered, and social stability has been affected. This year is an election year in Brazil. Reversing the country's economic difficulties and restoring the credibility of the civilian government among the people have become major tasks for the Brazilian government.

To combat inflation, Brazil had implemented the "Cruzado Plan" in 1986 and the "New Cruzado Plan" in 1987, but neither achieved the expected results. After summarizing the experiences and lessons from the previous two plans, the Brazilian government adopted a broad consultation approach with business leaders, political figures, and union leaders to seek support from all sectors. In terms of specific policies, attention was also given to potential impacts, and certain supplementary measures were adopted. For example, when announcing the price freeze, corresponding increases in borrowing and savings deposit interest rates were made to prevent a "consumption boom" and shortages of goods. At the same time, the Brazilian government promptly reported the reform plan to international financial institutions and creditor organizations, requesting support for Brazil's reforms in terms of debt relief and new loans.

After the "Summer Plan" was announced, reactions from various sectors of Brazilian society were intense. Some representatives from the business community believe that curbing inflation is necessary, and the government's reform plan should be supported, but there are also many who oppose it, arguing that freezing prices and raising bank interest rates will lead to a new recession. Union leaders have stated that if the new price and wage policies harm workers' interests, they will launch new strikes to resist. It seems that whether the "Summer Plan" can be implemented smoothly will directly affect Brazil's future economic and political developments. The Sarney government will face a severe test in its final year in office.

### 控制通货膨胀　恢复经济增长——巴西提出新的经济改革计划

　　控制通货膨胀　恢复经济增长
    ——巴西提出新的经济改革计划
    本报记者  兰才基
    巴西总统萨尔内一月十五日宣布了一项以控制通货膨胀为主要目标的改革计划，这一计划被称为“夏令计划”，是萨尔内政府执政后采取的第三次重大经济改革行动。
    “夏令计划”的主要特点是行政改革和经济改革同时并进。在行政改革方面，联邦政府的二十七个部精减合并为二十二个部，撤销联邦政府下属四十二个机构。据透露，随着这些部门的撤并，将有六万多名联邦政府职员被解聘。政府还决定出售一批国营企业的股权，加速私有化进程。
    在经济方面，主要是调整现行的物价与工资政策。从本月十六日起全国物价一律冻结，然后逐步调价，居民基本生活用品由政府规定牌价，并严格实行市场监督。新的工资政策将由政府和劳、资三方通过“社会协议”的方式共同制定。今后政府用于支付公职人员的工资总额不得超过政府收入的百分之六十五；鼓励私人企业通过劳、资双方自行协商的办法进行调资。
    改革计划还涉及到国家财政制度和金融货币政策，如规定政府不再通过发行债券来弥补财政赤字，提高银行贷款和储蓄存款利率；发行新货币“新克鲁扎多”，新旧货币的比值为一比一千，并宣布新货币贬值百分之十七，使它目前与美元的比价为一比一。
    巴西政府的“夏令计划”是在通货膨胀日益加剧的形势下提出的。去年巴西通胀率高达百分之九百三十三，而且今年还有继续恶化的趋势。由于通货膨胀加剧，经济发展受到阻碍，社会局势也很不安定。今年是巴西的大选年。扭转国家经济的困难局面恢复文人政府在群众中的威信，已经成为巴西政府当前面临的重大课题。
    为了对付通货膨胀，巴西曾经在一九八六年实行过“克鲁扎多”计划，一九八七年又提出“新克鲁扎多计划”，但都没有取得预期的效果。在总结前两次的经验教训后，今年的改革计划中，巴西政府采取了同企业界、政界以及工会领导人进行广泛协商，争取各界支持的做法。具体政策上，也注意到可能产生的效果，因而采取某些辅助性措施。例如，在宣布冻结物价时，相应提高借贷和储蓄存款利率，以防产生“消费热”和物资供应短缺现象。同时，巴西政府还及时地将改革计划向国际金融机构和债权组织作出通报，要求各方从减轻债务负担、提供新贷款方面对巴西的改革给予支持。
    “夏令计划”公布后，巴西社会各界反应强烈。工商界一些代表认为抑制通胀势在必行，政府改革计划应该支持，但也有不少人持反对意见，理由是冻结物价和提高银行利率会带来新的衰退。工会领导人则表示，如果新的物价与工资政策有损职工利益，就将发动新的罢工运动加以抵制。看来，“夏令计划”能否顺利进行，将直接关系到巴西今后经济、政治局势的发展。萨尔内政府在执政最后一年里还将经历一场严峻的考验。
