Title: Reflections on the "Overtaking Lane"

It is somewhat embarrassing to admit that, at the age of forty-nine, I have yet to experience the thrill of driving on a highway. Although reports have mentioned that the Beijing to Shijiazhuang highway is already in use, I have not had the chance to try it out. Unexpectedly, by sheer coincidence, I found myself joyfully speeding along the highways of Italy and Britain.

The driving rules in Italy are similar to those in China, where vehicles drive on the right side of the road. In Britain, however, it is the opposite, with vehicles driving on the left. The highways in Italy consist of two and a half lanes: one overtaking lane, one normal lane, and half a lane for vehicles that have broken down. In Britain, the highways have three and a half lanes, with an additional slow lane compared to Italy. The difference between three and a half lanes and two and a half lanes lies in the degree of perfection. From my layman's observation, the key to a highway's high speed, apart from being "fully enclosed," is the presence of an overtaking lane. Otherwise, if fast cars, slow cars, good cars, and bad cars all crowd onto one normal lane, the highway would exist in name only.

To fully utilize the overtaking lane, the driving rules stipulate that any vehicle on the normal lane, after overtaking a vehicle in front, must immediately return to the normal lane, ensuring that the overtaking lane remains unobstructed. If someone occupies the overtaking lane without overtaking, blocking others from overtaking, they will be fined or even sentenced. This way, the overtaking lane provides equal opportunities for everyone to overtake. If you are skilled and energetic, wanting to reach your destination quickly, you can overtake continuously. If someone has no urgent matter, they can drive steadily on the normal lane or overtake after a while. If I am old and lack energy, I can drive slowly on the slow lane. Here, no one obstructs anyone, and no one is allowed to obstruct anyone. There is no room for jealousy, and even if there were, there would be no reason for it. Therefore, the owners of various vehicles each find their place, showcasing their abilities, enjoying the pursuit and the swiftness.

Highways, with their scientific, equal, fast, and safe characteristics, are not only being continuously improved by developed countries, making them the main arteries of transportation, but developing countries are also starting to build and develop highways. Highways have become one of the symbols of a country's development and progress.

Listening to the roar of the car body rubbing against the air, I thought, can the theory and principles of the overtaking lane be applied to talent competition or competition in general? If, in the matter of personnel use, a highway is built and an overtaking lane is opened, various talents will stand out; if various talents are blocked on the "seniority," "backing," and "connections" lane, causing old cows to pant and thousand-mile horses to be stifled, such a situation will become a thing of the past.

It seems that the idea of "the train runs fast because the locomotive pulls it" used on highways does not work. Establishing a highway-style personnel system and opening an overtaking lane for talent competition is a requirement of historical development and a mark of social progress. For this, I call out to the spring: Open an "overtaking lane" for the growth and development of all kinds of talents.

### 有感于“超车道”

　　有感于“超车道”
    崔永生
    说来惭愧，年届天命，尚不知在高速公路上奔驰，是何滋味。虽然报载北京至石家庄的高速公路，已经启用，但至今无缘一试。不料，纯属偶然的机遇，竟在意大利和英国的高速公路上，忘情地奔驰起来。
    意大利的行车规则，与我国相同，靠右边走。英国则相反，靠左边行。前者的高速公路是两条半车道：一条超车道，一条正常车道，半条供车出了故障时用的停车道。后者的高速公路是三条半车道，比前者多了一条慢车道。三条半车道与两条半车道的区别，在于完善程度不同而已。据我这个外行观察，高速公路所以能高速，除了“全封闭”之外，关键在于有一条超车道。否则，如果快车、慢车，好车、坏车，都挤在一条正常车道上，就会名存而实亡。
    为了充分发挥超车道的作用，行车规则规定：凡在正常行车道上的车，通过超车道越过了前面的车之后，必须马上回到正常车道上来，保证超车道畅通无阻。如果占着超车道而不超车，挡着他人超车，就要课以罚款乃至判刑。
    这样，超车道为任何人提供了平等的超车机会。你技术高超，精力充沛，想快点到达目的地，可以不断地超车。他没有急事，想稳扎稳打，可在正常车道上行驶，或开一段时间之后再超车。我年老体衰，精力不济，可在慢车道上慢慢吞吞走。这里，没有谁妨碍谁，也不允许谁妨碍谁，不存在妒嫉的问题，想妒嫉也找不到由头。因此，各种车辆的主人，各得其所，各显神通，惬意地你追我赶，风驰电掣。
    高速公路由于具备科学、平等、高速、安全等优点，不仅发达国家不断完善高速公路建设，使之成为交通运输的主要命脉，而且发展中国家也开始建造和发展高速公路。高速公路成了一个国家的发展、进步的象征之一。
    听着车身与空气摩擦发出的呼啸声，我想，超车道的理论与原则，可不可以用在人才竞争或竞赛上呢？若在用人问题上，也建造一条高速公路，开辟一条超车道，各种人才就会脱颖而出；各种人才被堵在“论资排辈”、“后台”、“关系”的道上，造成老牛喘息，千里马憋气的局面，就会成为历史陈迹。
    看来，把沿着轨迹走的所谓“火车跑得快，全靠车头带”的铁路观念，用于高速公路上来是行不通的。建立高速公路式的用人制度，开辟人才竞争的超车道，是历史发展的要求，社会进步的标志之一。为此，我对着春天呼吁：为各种人才的成长发展，开辟一条“超车道”吧。
