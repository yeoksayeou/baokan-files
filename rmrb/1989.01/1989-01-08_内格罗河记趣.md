A Journey Along the Negro River

I. The Ever-Changing "Black River"

The Negro River, known as the "Black River" in Portuguese, stretches over 2,000 kilometers and is the largest tributary on the left bank of the Amazon River. The river's water is a light yellow and transparent, but from a distance, it appears dark and shiny, hence its name. The river's clarity and smoothness reflect the blue sky, white clouds, and the emerald-green forests on both banks, creating a particularly beautiful scene.

The Negro River is wide, with both banks several kilometers apart. From Manaus, we traveled upstream by boat for over five hours to reach the most scenic part of the river, known as "Lake of a Thousand Islands." Here, islands are scattered like stars, making it difficult to distinguish the main river channel while navigating. The river's water level fluctuates greatly. During the rainy season, the water can rise more than a meter in just a day and night; during the dry season, the water level can drop by tens of meters. Near the riverbank, there are flooded forests. During low tide, the trees emerge from the water, becoming numerous green islands in the wide river; during high tide, these green islands are submerged again. So, when you pass by this place, you might think you are sailing between two islands, but on your return, you see an expanse of water.

II. The Mysterious Floating Rice

Along the tributaries and branches of the Negro River, you can often see clusters of floating rice. It is called rice because it has the general characteristics of rice, with leaves and ears similar to ordinary rice. However, the grains it produces are not edible, and about 90% of the ears are empty. Its most distinctive feature is that, regardless of the tide, it always stays about half a meter above the water. The secret lies in its roots, which are anchored in the riverbed mud. The rice stalks can grow with the rising water, and during low tide, the stalks curl and twist, keeping the upper half of the branches and leaves about half a meter above the water. Because of this feature, locals often use it to measure the depth of the river. A Brazilian friend said, when you sail to the tributaries of the Negro River and want to know the water depth, you just need to pull out a stalk of floating rice and measure it. Hearing this, we casually pulled out a stalk of floating rice from the side of the boat, and saw the thin stalk slowly emerge from the water. After measuring, it was over 6 meters long. The adaptability of plants to their environment is truly astonishing.

III. The Ferocious Piranha

The Negro River is home to a type of fish known as the piranha. In Brazil, there are four varieties of piranhas: white, red, black, and mixed-colored. Among them, the black piranha is the largest, growing up to about 50 centimeters long.

Piranhas are ferocious and often swim in groups. They have sharp teeth and prefer to eat bloody animals. When birds, livestock, or even people accidentally fall into the water, they will attack in groups, each taking a bite, and in no time, only the bones will remain. Therefore, local residents never swim or bathe in the river, and they often warn outsiders not to enter the water lightly.

However, piranha meat is tender and is considered a delicacy. Among our fellow passengers, there was a Brazilian who once opened a rubber plantation in the dense forest along the banks of the Negro River and hired about a dozen Indian workers to plant rubber trees. There was a period when food supplies were scarce, so he led a few people to fish in the Negro River using hooks. The front boat would cast the hooks as it moved, and the rear boat could then collect the fish. Because piranhas attack as soon as they see food, they are easily caught. If the net is not quickly retrieved, the live piranhas will eat their caught companions.

　　内格罗河记趣
    吴志华
    一、气象万千的“黑河”
    内格罗河在葡语中意为“黑河”，它全长２０００多公里，是亚马孙河左岸最大支流。内格罗河水质呈浅黄透明，远远望去则黝黑发亮，故因此而得名。河水的清亮、平滑，使蓝天白云以及两岸翡翠般的森林清澈地倒映其中，景色格外秀美。
    内格罗河水道宽阔，两岸相距数公里。从马瑙斯出发，我们乘船溯河而上航行５个多小时，就到了内格罗河景色最佳处“千岛之湖”。这里岛屿星罗棋布，以至于航行其间竟辨不清主河道在哪里。内格罗河落差变化极大。雨季时，河水能在昼夜之间上涨一米多高；旱季时，河水又会陡落十几米。河道附近是水淹林，落潮时，林木冒出水面，成为宽阔河道上的无数绿岛；涨潮时，绿岛又淹没于水中，所以，当你路过此地时，认准是航行于两岛之间，归来时，眼前则是汪洋一片的湖面。
    　　　　二、奇异的浮生稻
    在内格罗河的支流、河汊两旁，常常可以看到聚生的浮生稻。说它是稻，因为它具有水稻的一般特性，叶子、稻穗与普通水稻极为相似。不同的是，它结的实不能供人食用，而且９０％的穗子是空瘪的。它最大的特点是，不管潮水涨落，它总能露出水面半米左右。其奥秘在于，它的根部扎于河床淤泥中，稻茎能跟上河水上涨的速度而伸长。落潮时，稻茎又盘旋弯曲，使上半部枝叶始终高出水面半米。由于这一特点，当地人常常用它测量河水的深度。巴西朋友说，当你航行到内格罗河支流，欲知道水深多少，只要拔出一棵浮生稻一量就行。听他们这么一说，我们随手从船舷边轻轻拔起一棵浮生稻，只见细细的稻秆缓缓升出水面，最后一丈量，竟有６米多长。植物适应环境的能力真叫人惊叹不已。
    　　　　三、习性暴戾的食人鱼
    内格罗河中有一种鱼叫食人鱼。巴西的食人鱼有白色的、红色的、黑色的、杂色的４个品种，其中黑色的个体最大，可长到５０厘米长左右。
    食人鱼习性暴戾，常聚群而游。它有锋利的牙齿，喜食血腥动物。当鸟类、牲畜甚至人不慎落入水中，它们便会群起而攻之，你一口，我一口，不一会竟被咬得只剩下一把骨架。因此，当地居民是绝不在河中游泳洗澡的，而且还常告诫异乡人不要轻易下水。
    但是，食人鱼肉质细嫩，又是人们的美味佳肴。同船的巴西朋友中有一人曾在内格罗河岸的密林处开辟一个橡胶种植场，从附近雇了十几名印第安人种植橡胶树。曾有一段时间，食物供应不上，于是他带领几个人到内格罗河上放钩钓鱼。前面一只船，边走边放下浮钩，后面一只船即可收钩取鱼。因为食人鱼见食就猛捕，当然也就容易上钩，如不快收网，活着的食人鱼还要吃上钩的同伴呢。
