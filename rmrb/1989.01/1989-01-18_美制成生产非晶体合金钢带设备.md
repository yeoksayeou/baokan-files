The United States has developed a device for the continuous production of amorphous alloy steel strip, which is scheduled to begin production this spring. Transformers made from this amorphous steel strip can significantly reduce energy consumption.

Currently, all transformers in the world use silicon steel sheets as their cores. Due to the regular crystalline arrangement of atoms in silicon steel sheets, energy is consumed during the processes of magnetization and demagnetization. In contrast, the atoms in amorphous alloy steel strips are arranged in a disordered manner, making magnetization and demagnetization easier. This significantly reduces energy consumption. Tests have shown that transformers of the same power, made from amorphous alloy steel strips, can reduce energy consumption by 30% to 50%.

The principle behind manufacturing amorphous alloy steel strips is to cool molten metal from high temperatures to room temperature within 1/1000 of a second, causing the atoms in the alloy steel to arrange in a disordered manner due to the sudden cooling.

　　美制成生产非晶体合金钢带设备
    新华社华盛顿１月１５日电  （记者胡安生）美国研制成一种连续生产非晶体合金钢带的设备，定于今年春季投入生产。用这种非晶体钢带制造的各种电源变压器可大大降低电能消耗。
    目前世界上的各种电源变压器都是采用硅钢片作为铁芯，由于硅钢片中原子具有规则的晶体状排列，因此，在磁化和非磁化的过程中要消耗电能。而非晶体合金钢带中的原子排列呈不规则状，更容易磁化和非磁化，这就大大减少电能的消耗。经测定，同样功率的电源变压器，用非晶体合金钢带制成的可降低电能消耗３０％至５０％。
    制造非晶体合金钢带的原理是使高温的熔融金属在１‰秒内冷却到室温，造成合金钢中的原子在骤然冷却下不能作有规则的排列。
