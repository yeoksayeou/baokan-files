In Miao Wei Village, Wang Ji Township, Suqian City, Jiangsu Province, there is a young couple. The husband is named Tang Minhua, and the wife is named Liu Peifang. Last July 17th in the evening, Liu and Tang had a quarrel over a trivial matter, which escalated into a physical fight. Liu, in a fit of anger, smashed a water bottle and a teacup, then rode her bicycle straight to the orchard to confront her in-laws. Her father-in-law was working in the orchard, but her mother-in-law was busy in the thatched shed. Upon seeing her mother-in-law, Liu started cursing and slapped her twice, smashed the iron pot used for cooking, and made the house a mess. The mother-in-law was so angry that she couldn't speak.

Upon hearing the news, Zhang Rumei from the Wang Ji Township Legal Service Office immediately dropped his chopsticks and rushed to the scene. After understanding the situation, Old Zhang sternly asked Liu Peifang, "You and your husband had a fight, why did you hit your mother-in-law?" Liu Peifang replied confidently, "She is his mother, if I don't hit her, who should I hit?" Old Zhang patiently explained, "Respecting the elderly is a traditional virtue of the Chinese people, and the law also protects the legal rights of the elderly. As a junior, how can one not respect their elders? Article 22 of the 'Regulations on Administrative Penalties for Public Security' states: Those who beat others, causing slight injury, shall be detained for no more than 15 days, fined no more than 200 yuan, or given a warning. You beat and scolded your mother-in-law without reason and smashed her pot. This is an infringement of personal rights and a illegal act."

These words made Liu Peifang blush with shame and she could not speak. She immediately apologized to her in-laws and asked for their forgiveness. Zhang Rumei seized the opportunity to set three rules for Liu Peifang: first, to respect and love each other as husband and wife; second, to respect her in-laws; third, to study and use the law diligently and maintain good neighborly relations. Liu Peifang immediately agreed to follow these rules and started cleaning and tidying up the house for her in-laws, changing the bedsheets and quilts, and went to the market to buy a new iron pot for the elderly.

From then on, Liu Peifang actively participated in the village's legal knowledge study sessions and scored 97 out of 100 in the recent city-wide farmers' legal knowledge exam. In her daily life, Liu Peifang takes the initiative to care for her in-laws, asking about their well-being. Last Mid-Autumn Festival, Liu Peifang invited her in-laws to her home to celebrate the reunion.

　　知法悔过孝敬公婆
    江苏省宿迁市王集乡苗圩村有对小夫妻，男的叫唐民华，女的叫刘培芳。去年７月１７日傍晚，刘、唐因小事发生口角，继而厮打起来。刘一怒之下将水瓶、茶杯摔碎，接着骑上自行车直奔果园，要找公婆算帐。公公去果园干活了，婆婆正在草棚里忙着。刘培芳一见婆婆就破口大骂，打婆婆两记耳光，把做饭的铁锅也砸了，又将屋里弄得乱七八糟。婆婆被儿媳的举动气得说不出话来。
    王集乡法律服务所的张如美闻讯后，立即放下饭碗，赶到现场。问明情况后，老张严肃地问刘培芳：“你们小两口打架，为什么打你婆婆？”刘培芳理由十足地说：“那是他妈，我不打她，打谁？”老张耐心地对她说：“尊老是我国人民的传统美德，法律也规定保护老人的合法权益。作为晚辈，怎么能不尊重自己的长辈呢？《治安管理处罚条例》第２２条规定：殴打他人，造成轻微伤害的，处十五日以下拘留、二百元以下罚款或者警告。你无故打骂婆婆，砸坏老人锅，这是侵犯了他人的人身权利，是违法的行为。”
    一席话说得刘培芳面红耳赤，羞愧难言，主动向公婆赔礼，请求原谅。张如美趁热打铁，给刘培芳约法三章：一要夫妻互尊互爱；二要孝敬公婆；三要认真学法用法，搞好邻里关系。刘培芳当即表示一定做到，并马上动手给公婆打扫、清理屋子，换洗床单被子，又上街给老人买了一口新铁锅。
    从此，刘培芳积极参加村里组织的法律知识学习，在最近组织的全市农民普法考试中取得了９７分的好成绩。平时刘培芳主动关心公婆，问寒问暖。去年中秋佳节，刘培芳将公婆请回家中过团圆节。
