Nanyang works to elevate the status of family planning, improve local regulations, and strengthen supervision and constraints. In the past three years, the city's family planning rate has consistently been above 99.6%.

Years of practice have made the decision-makers in Nanyang realize: only by adapting to new situations as they arise can the family planning policy be effectively implemented. They were the first to implement the "one-vote veto" system for family planning work across various sectors: all evaluations for advanced units, salary adjustments, promotions, and professional title evaluations in the city involve the participation of the family planning department for approval. In 1988 alone, two advanced units and more than 20 public servants were stripped of their honors, benefits, positions, and titles for failing to effectively manage family planning.

The Nanyang Municipal Committee and Municipal Government, along with various intermediate and grassroots levels, have signed family planning target management responsibility books and guarantee letters with each other, implementing a combination of key inspections and universal inspections to ensure that all measures are implemented. In 1988 alone, six village leadership teams had their main members replaced or adjusted due to poor implementation of family planning targets.

The management of floating populations' family planning had been a weak point in Nanyang. To address this, the municipal government issued the "Regulations on Strengthening Family Planning Management for Urban Floating Populations," stipulating that all outsiders renting units or individuals' houses and sites, as well as other temporary residents, must provide family planning certificates from their county-level or above family planning departments. They must then be reviewed by the city's sub-district offices (townships) or residential committees (villages) before they can apply for temporary residence permits; otherwise, fines will be imposed on the units or individuals renting out the houses. At the same time, clear regulations were also made for the family planning management of Nanyang residents who go out to do business or work.

　　完善地方性法规　控制生育率上升    
    南阳强化计划生育约束机制
    本报讯  河南省南阳市努力提高计划生育工作的地位，完善地方性法规，强化监督手段和约束机制。近３年来，全市计划生育率一直都在９９．６％以上。
    多年来的实践，使南阳市的决策者认识到：只有根据不断出现的新情况，以变应变，才能使计划生育政策得以落实。他们率先实行计生工作对诸方面的“一票否决权”：全市凡是评先进、调资、提干、评定职称，都吸收计生部门参与把关。仅１９８８年，就有两个先进单位和２０多名公职人员分别因抓计生工作不力而被取消已取得的荣誉、利益、职务和职称。
    南阳市委、市政府与各中层，中层与各基层，基层单位与育龄妇女，层层签订了计生目标管理责任书和保证书，实行重点检查和普遍检查相结合，保证条条措施得以落实。仅１９８８年，就因计生目标落实得不好，６个村的领导班子的主要成员被撤换调整。
    流动人口的计生管理曾是南阳市的一个薄弱环节。为此，市政府发布了《加强城市流动人口计划生育管理条例》，规定凡在本市租赁单位和个人房屋、场地的外来人员和其它暂住人员，必须持本人户口所在地乡级以上计生证明，经本市办事处（乡）、居委会（村）审查方可办理暂住户口，否则要对出租房屋的单位或个人处以罚金。同时，对本市外出经商、做工人员等的计生管理问题，也作了明确的规定。
