	Is it enriching life or a sign of cultural overheating?
	Guangzhou residents debate the indoor ice sculpture exhibition

	According to Xinhua News Agency, Guangzhou, January 26 (Reporter Jiang Zuozhong): The Guangzhou Ice Sculpture Art Exhibition, scheduled to open on February 1, has not yet begun, but discussions in the city of the Five Rams are already heated: those who praise it see it as a good way to enrich cultural life during the Spring Festival, while those who criticize it view it as a symptom of cultural overheating that needs to be rectified.

	According to the organizers, Beijing Huayuan Exhibition Company, and relevant personnel from the cooperating units in Guangzhou: The purpose of holding this exhibition is to introduce the art form of ice sculpture, unique to the north, to the people of Guangzhou, and to enrich their cultural life during the Spring Festival. They especially thanked the relevant departments and units of Guangzhou for their support and cooperation during the preparation of the exhibition. The ice sculpture exhibition uses indoor large-scale circulating refrigeration to maintain a constant temperature, with a total lighting and power load of approximately 280 kilowatts, consuming over 5,000 degrees of electricity per day. Despite the tight electricity supply in Guangzhou, the power supply bureau originally planned to support the exhibition with 0.80 yuan per degree of negotiated electricity. Later, the organizers decided to use self-generated electricity, and received support from the Guangzhou Petrochemical Company, which provided them with 140 tons of diesel, half at the market price and half at the negotiated price.

	However, many people's objections to the ice sculpture exhibition seem to stem from concerns about electricity and fuel. Electricity in Guangzhou is very tight, and many factories have been operating on a four-day work, three-day rest schedule for a long time. Since November, residential areas have also implemented staggered power outages in the evenings. In December, an electric light festival organized by a certain city from another province in Guangzhou had already caused dissatisfaction among citizens. After the news of the 30-day ice sculpture exhibition was released, reporters heard complaints in factories, schools, hospitals, and government agencies: Isn't electricity tight? How come there's electricity for the ice sculpture exhibition? Even after learning that the exhibition did not use electricity from the grid, many people still felt that using over 100 tons of diesel for the ice sculpture exhibition was inappropriate, given the shortage of fuel in power plants and self-generated electricity units.

	The ticket price of 20 yuan is also a topic of discussion. Some low-income workers, including young employees, were shocked and felt they couldn't afford to enjoy it. Some people also pointed out that concert tickets for Hong Kong singers cost 60 yuan and still sold out, so 20 yuan for an ice sculpture exhibition ticket is affordable for Guangzhou residents.

	As of the time of this report, the debate surrounding this ice sculpture exhibition has not yet ended.

　　是丰富生活情趣，还是文化过热现象？    
    广州人对室内冰雕展议论纷纷
    据新华社广州１月２６日电（记者江佐中）定于２月１日开展的广州冰雕艺术展览尚未拉开帷幕，五羊城里对这次展览的议论却已是沸沸扬扬：褒之者认为此举是丰富春节文化生活的好事，贬之者认为这是文化过热现象应在整治之列。
    据主办单位北京华远展览公司负责人和广州协作单位有关人士介绍：举办这次展览的目的是向广州人民介绍冰雕这一北方特有的艺术形式，丰富广州人民的春节文化生活。他们特别感谢广州市有关部门和单位在展览筹备期间给予的支持和合作。冰雕展采用室内大面积循环制冷的方式保持恒温，照明和动力总负荷大约２８０千瓦，每天耗电５０００多度。尽管广州电力紧张，供电局原来还是准备以０．８０元一度的议价电来支持展览。后来主办者决定改用自发电，又得到广州市石油公司的支持，供给他们１４０吨柴油，一半平价，一半议价。
    但是，人们对冰雕展的异议似乎也大多因电力、燃料而起。广州电力十分紧张，不少工厂长期开四停三，去年１１月起居民区晚间也实行分片轮流停电。去年１２月２０日起外省某市来广州搞了个电气化的灯会，就曾引起市民的不满。为期３０天的冰雕展的消息传出后，在工厂、学校、医院、机关，记者都不时听到这样的抱怨：不是说电力紧张吗，怎么搞冰雕展又有电了？就是得知展览并没有占用电网的电之后，还是有不少人认为，在发电厂和企事业单位自备发电机燃料紧缺的情况下，拿１００多吨柴油去搞冰雕展也不妥当。
    ２０元一张的票价也是人们议论的话题之一。一些工资收入不高的人包括青年职工听后都瞠目结舌，认为不敢去享受。也有人认为香港歌星演唱会票价６０元都有人听，２０元钱的冰雕展票，广州人还是买得起的。
    至记者发稿时止，围绕这次冰雕展的争论还未结束。
