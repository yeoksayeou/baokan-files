Longbai Township Poultry and Livestock Breeding Farm in Shenyang's Dongling District utilizes waste from alcohol production to generate biogas, accumulating 700,000 kilowatt-hours of electricity over several years, creating value worth 350,000 yuan.

Since 1982, they have developed the resources from their own alcohol factory's waste, turning waste into treasure. They have invested 125,000 yuan to build alcohol waste fermentation equipment and a biogas power station. They use anaerobic filtration to process alcohol waste to generate biogas for electricity, producing 250 cubic meters of biogas daily and generating 300 kilowatt-hours of electricity per day.
