Currently, during the rectification and adjustment period, enterprises generally face difficulties in developing production due to insufficient funds. What should be done? Tangshan Iron and Steel Company informed its employees of the difficulties and spared no effort to ensure the production of key projects.

At the end of 1988, Tangshan Iron and Steel Company sent multiple teams to various places to collect overdue payments.

Inside the Tangshan plant, a lively scene of collective fundraising emerged.

...

To ensure the smooth progress of national key construction projects and their timely completion and operation, Tangshan Iron and Steel Company took emergency measures, mobilizing everyone from the company leadership to each employee.

The expansion project of Tangshan's iron smelting is a key construction project during the Seventh Five-Year Plan, with a total investment of 750 million yuan and an annual production capacity of 750,000 tons. It is expected to start production in the spring of 1989, marking the end of Tangshan's history of having no mines and little iron, and entering a new stage of development. Since the construction began in October 1986, after intense work, by 1988, 700 million yuan had been completed. The civil engineering is in the final stage, most of the equipment installation is completed, and partial unit testing has begun. Water, electricity, and road conditions are nearly completed. The supporting project of the Bangma Mountain Iron Mine has been built and put into operation, and other production preparations are basically ready. However, at this critical moment when the goal is almost within reach, Tangshan encountered a serious shortage of funds: the state allocated corporate bonds for 1987 and 1988 totaling 310 million yuan, but 183 million yuan has not been realized yet. Currently, there is no way to borrow money, and the short-term loans that have been borrowed have already been recalled. Tangshan is unable to pay for equipment and progress payments to construction units, resulting in some equipment manufacturers refusing to deliver goods, construction units unable to pay wages, and employees feeling uncertain.

Faced with difficulties, what should Tangshan do? Manager Tian Xien, Party Secretary Yuan Ruixin, and the company leadership team spent many sleepless nights over this. They reviewed and summarized the significant changes and experiences Tangshan had achieved, believing that the solution lies with the masses.

Over the past 10 years, Tangshan has relied on the masses to overcome various difficulties. Without going too far back, just take 1988 as an example. Tangshan faced shortages and price increases in fuel and raw materials, resulting in a reduction of 47 million yuan in profits for the company that year. The company leadership was not deterred by the difficulties; they mobilized the masses, actively digested the factors causing the reduction in profits, proposed 27 measures in 7 aspects to tap potential, and adjusted the annual production and operation targets. They strove to increase the production of marketable products, develop new products, and improve economic benefits. The company also launched a mass rationalization suggestion activity, adopting and implementing 2,372 out of the 32,000 suggestions made, creating benefits of nearly 15 million yuan. Through arduous efforts, not only was the annual national plan completed two and a half months ahead of schedule, but the annual struggle target was also achieved ahead of time. The production of major products such as steel, iron, and materials all showed significant growth compared to the previous year, and the total tax revenue increased by 35.6% compared to the previous year.

Tangshan's practice has proven a truth: relying on employees means there is a way out. Therefore, the company leadership explained the current situation and the problems encountered to the masses, asking everyone to brainstorm and come up with solutions, and to work together to overcome the difficulties.

When people learned that due to a shortage of funds, the national key project was facing the danger of halting construction, everyone became anxious. They understood that if the project is completed and put into operation on time, the daily benefit would be 260,000 yuan, but if it stops, disasters such as frozen equipment pipes, theft, and looting would occur, causing losses to the state, the enterprise, and the employees. The common interest aroused the employees' sense of responsibility and urgency, prompting everyone to think and act together, sparing no effort to protect the key project.

The message "Launch a fundraising campaign to ensure the national key project" was broadcast through the company's closed-circuit television to various units and residential areas, causing a strong reaction. On the second day after the message was broadcast, an inspiring scene appeared in the company: the company leadership brought money, the office staff brought money, the frontline workers brought money, and even some retired employees joined the fundraising. Many employees brought money they had saved to buy TVs and refrigerators to the company. The staff of the company's propaganda department, Li Xingping, mobilized his mother to contribute the 120,000 yuan she had saved with great effort. The female worker Lu Jun from the second steelmaking plant, who supports her elderly mother while raising a child, contributed the 1,000 yuan she had saved despite her modest living conditions. The employees said, "When the big river has no water, the small river dries up. The company is in trouble, and we all share the burden." In less than a week, nearly 70 million yuan was raised, with an average of 1,500 yuan per employee. Although these funds could not solve all the construction needs, they did alleviate the urgent situation, and the national key project is expected to be put into operation.

　　当前在治理整顿中，企业发展生产普遍遇到资金不足的困难。怎么办？唐山钢铁公司把困难告诉职工，千方百计保重点工程投产。
    唐钢依靠全体职工筹资渡难关
    邢鸿儒
    １９８８年岁末，唐山钢铁公司派出多路人马，赶往各地催收货款；
    唐钢院内，出现了群众集资的热闹场面；
    ……
    为了保证国家重点建设项目的顺利进行，按时建成投产，唐钢采取应急措施，从公司领导，到每个职工，上上下下都动起来了。
    唐钢扩建炼铁工程是国家“七五”重点建设项目，总投资７．５亿元，年生产能力７５万吨，预计１９８９年春投入生产，届时将结束唐钢无矿少铁的历史，进入新的发展阶段。这项工程自１９８６年１０月动工兴建以来，经过紧张施工，到１９８８年完成７亿元，土建工程进入收尾阶段，设备安装大部分完成，开始局部单体试车，水、电、路等外部条件均已接近完工。为其配套的棒磨山铁矿工程已建成投产，其他各项生产准备工作也基本就绪。但，就在仅差一搏即达目标的关键时刻，唐钢遇到了资金短缺的严重困难：国家在下达投资计划中，１９８７、１９８８两年安排的企业债券共３．１亿元，还有１．８３亿元至今没有落实。目前借贷无门，所借短期贷款也已扣回。唐钢无力支付设备款和施工单位进度费，致使有的设备厂家拒不发货，施工单位发不起工资，职工心神不定。
    面对困难，唐钢怎么办？经理田锡恩、党委书记袁瑞新和公司领导一班人，为此渡过了一个个不眠之夜。他们回顾和总结唐钢的巨大变化和取得的经验，认为办法在群众中。
    １０年来，唐钢依靠群众克服了各种困难。远的不讲，就拿１９８８年来说，唐钢燃料、原材料供应不足、价格上涨幅度大，公司仅此全年减利４７００多万元。公司领导没有被困难吓住，他们发动群众，积极消化减利因素，提出７个方面、２７条挖潜措施，同时调整全年生产经营目标，努力增产适销对路产品，开发新产品，提高经济效益。公司还开展群众性合理化建议活动，在提出的３．２万多项建议中，采纳实施了２３７２项，创效益近１５００万元。经过艰苦努力，不仅提前两个半月完成全年国家计划，而且提前实现了全年奋斗目标，钢、铁、材等主要产品产量都较去年有显著增长，利税总额比去年增长了３５．６％。
    唐钢的实践证明了一个道理：依靠职工就有出路。于是，公司领导把当前的情况和遇到的问题向群众讲清楚，让大家出主意想办法，群策群力共渡难关。
    当人们得知因资金短缺、国家重点工程项目面临停工的危险时，一个个都急了眼。他们懂得，工程按期建成投产，一天的效益就是２６万元，而一旦停工，设备管道冻坏、偷拿哄抢等天灾人祸降临，国家受损，企业受损，职工也跟着受损。共同的利益，激发了职工的责任感和紧迫感，促使人们想到一起，干到一起，千方百计保重点。
    “开展集资活动，确保国家重点”的信息，通过公司的闭路电视，传到各单位、各住宅小区，引起强烈反响。信息播发的第２天，公司内激动人心的场面就出现了：公司领导把钱拿来了，机关干部把钱拿来了，生产一线的工人把钱拿来了，有的离退休职工也加入了集资的行列。不少职工把准备买彩电、冰箱的钱送到公司。公司宣教处干部李兴平动员母亲把辛辛苦苦积攒的１．２万元拿来集了资。二炼钢厂女职工陆军一个人带孩子供养老母，生活本来不富裕，还把攒下的１０００元拿出来。职工们说，“大河没水小河干，公司有困难，我们大家来承担。”不到一周时间，共集资近７０００万元，公司职工人均１５００元。这些资金虽然不能解决全部建设需要，但却解了燃眉之急，国家重点工程投产有望了。
