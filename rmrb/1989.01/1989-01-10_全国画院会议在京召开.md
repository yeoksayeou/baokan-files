The national conference of provincial and municipal academies of fine arts recently concluded in Beijing. Representatives from 28 provincial and municipal academies of fine arts across the country discussed issues such as the management system of academies of fine arts and how to adapt the work of academies of fine arts to the economic situation and social demands of reform and opening up.

Representatives agreed that academies of fine arts, as entities for artistic creation and research, should prioritize the creation of high-quality artworks that reflect the spirit of the times and national characteristics. They should also cultivate a group of artists with high cultural attainment and deep skills. For this purpose, it is necessary for the state to provide policy and economic support to academies of fine arts. Ensuring the living and creative conditions for artists, so that they can fully dedicate themselves to artistic creation, is an effective measure to prevent the outflow of talents and to attract foreign talents.

Regarding the issue of the commodity nature of artworks, representatives believed that artworks have a dual nature as both art and commodities, but they should first and foremost be good artworks. The commodity nature brings two aspects of influence to artistic creation. Some representatives pointed out that the pursuit of commodification often lowers the artistic level, leading to shoddy work that destroys artistic value, which in turn greatly reduces its commodity value. Therefore, commodity value must be based on artistic value. Only by creating high-quality artworks can there be commodity value.

Representatives reflected that in recent years, academies of fine arts have made many efforts in economic revenue generation and foreign exchange earnings, which have played an important role in supplementing insufficient funds and strengthening the internal competition mechanism. However, there are also shortcomings and mistakes, which is a problem worth studying.

Representatives also pointed out that the establishment of academies of fine arts should meet certain conditions and should not be too hasty or unregulated. The state should strengthen management.

　　全国画院会议在京召开
    全国部分省市画院工作会议，最近在北京结束。来自全国二十八个省市画院的代表围绕着画院的管理体制、画院工作如何适应改革开放的经济形势和社会要求等问题进行了讨论。代表们认为，画院作为美术创作和研究的实体，首要任务是创作出反映时代精神和民族特色的高质量的艺术品，并造就出一批具有较高修养和功力深厚的书画家。为此，国家给画院以政策上、经济上的支持是十分必要的。画院为画家提供生活和创作的保障，使画家全身心投入艺术创作，是防止人才外流和吸引国外人才的有效措施。
    关于美术品的商品规律问题，大家认为，美术品具有艺术品和商品的二重属性，但它首先应是好的艺术品。商品属性为艺术创作带来了两方面的作用。有的代表说，商品化的追求往往会降低其艺术水平，粗制滥造破坏了艺术价值，反过来也大大降低了其商品价值。因此，商品价值必须建立在艺术价值的基础上，只有创作高质量的艺术品，才有商品价值。
    代表们反映，几年来，画院在开展经济创收、创汇方面做了许多努力，它对补充经费不足，增强内部竞争机制起了重要作用。但也存在不足和失误，这是一个值得研究的问题。
    代表们还指出，画院的建立应具备一定条件，不能过热过快，不能放任自流，国家应该加强管理。
