The New China News Agency reported from Monrovia on January 17 that according to the Liberian maritime authorities, Liberia remains the world's largest maritime nation, with its ships' tonnage leading the world.

As of November 1988, there were 1,621 ships flying the Liberian flag worldwide, with a total tonnage of 50,663,542 tons.

Joseph Keller, the Liberian Maritime Commissioner, said in a speech that over the past 40 years, the maritime industry has provided the government with $400 million in revenue.

Currently, Liberia faces fierce competition in the international ship registration sector. To improve its maritime services, Liberia is now working to enhance safety and anti-pollution standards.
