With the rapid development of science and technology, information has become increasingly important to people. How to obtain information more quickly and conveniently has become a major concern for various industries around the world. Especially the modernization of communication tools has become particularly urgent. Therefore, following the telegraph, telephone, and telex, a new communication tool—the fax machine—has gained widespread use. With its unique advantages, it has won the favor of millions of users and become the best communication method in the current "information age." Now, an unprecedented "fax craze" is sweeping the globe.

The fax machine is a communication tool that can transmit text, charts, and photographs over ordinary telephone lines. Its advantages include fast transmission, ease of use, and relatively low cost. Additionally, since it transmits a copy of the original document and can automatically receive, it can avoid the "distortion" and errors that often occur in general communications. With the continuous improvement of global communication technology, fax machines not only can transmit over short distances but also over long distances, and the clarity of the transmitted documents is getting higher and higher. As long as a fax machine is configured, it can transmit documents from one country to another in just 20 seconds through ordinary telephone lines.

According to reports, the world's first fax machine was invented by a British watchmaker in 1842. At that time, his machine had poor functionality, low fax quality, and short transmission distance. Later, German and American scientists further researched and improved it, making the fax machine truly "worthy of its name." However, the fax machine only entered the practical stage in the past 20 years.

Currently, in various parts of the world, especially in international metropolises like London, Tokyo, and New York, the number of fax machine users is doubling every year. It is reported that there are already more than 4 million fax machines in use worldwide. Half of the telephone communications between Tokyo and New York each year are conducted through fax machines. It is reported that in New York, there is an unprecedented "obsession" with fax machines. Now, not only large and medium-sized enterprises widely use fax machines, but small companies, small enterprises, and even households have started using them. People use fax machines to transmit documents and images, discuss business, place orders, shop, and even arrange meetings. The fax machine has become an indispensable tool in daily life. In the past, when friends met, they would greet each other with "good day." Now, this has been replaced by questions like "What is your fax number?" However, fax machines can also bring trouble. If a love letter is sent through a fax machine, if the wrong number is dialed, "secrets" will be revealed.

Japan is the country with the highest penetration rate of fax machines in the world and is also the world's largest producer of fax machines. The global fax machine market is basically controlled by Japan. However, the United States and various Western European countries are catching up quickly.

In third-world countries, the use of fax machines is also increasing. Since fax machines can meet the requirements of fast, accurate, precise, and comprehensive information transmission, it can be foreseen that in a few years, the use of fax machines will be as widespread as telephones.

　　全球传真热
    王如君
    随着科学技术的飞速发展，信息越来越为人们所重视。如何更迅速、更方便地获得信息，成为世界上各行各业最为关心的问题。特别是通讯工具的现代化显得尤为迫切。因此，继电报、电话、电传之后，当前又有一种新的通讯工具——传真机得到了广泛使用。它以其独特的优势，赢得了成千上万用户的垂青，成为当今“信息时代”的最佳通讯手段。现在，一股前所未有的“传真热”正席卷全球。
    传真机是一种能利用普通电话线路传送文字、图表和照片的通讯工具，其优点是传递迅速、使用方便、价格也比较便宜。此外，由于它传送的是原件的复印件，而且可以自动接收，所以能够避免一般通讯过程中产生的“失真”和谬误。随着世界通讯技术的不断提高，传真机不仅可以近距离传送，而且可以远距离传送，传件清晰度也越来越高，只要配置了传真机，通过普通的电话线路就可以在２０秒钟内把资料从一个国家传到另一个国家。
    据报道，世界上最早的传真机是由英国的一名钟表匠于１８４２年发明的，当时他的机器功能很差，传真度极低，传送距离也不远。后来经过德国和美国的科学家进一步研究和改进，传真机才变得“名符其实”，但是，传真机真正进入实用阶段则是近２０年的事。
    目前，在世界各地，特别是在像伦敦、东京、纽约这样的国际大都市，传真机的用户每年都成倍地上升。据统计，现在全世界已安装使用的传真机有４００多万台。东京和纽约之间的电话来往每年有一半是通过传真机进行的。据悉，在纽约，人们对传真机出现了空前的“着魔”现象，现在不但大中型企业广泛使用传真机，小公司、小企业，甚至家庭也开始使用传真机了。人们利用传真机传送资料和图片、洽谈生意、订货购物，甚至约会等等，传真机已成为日常生活中不可或缺的工具之一。过去朋友相见，互道“日安”，现在则被“你的传真号码是多少”这样的问话取代了。不过传真机也能带来麻烦，如果通过传真机传递情书，一旦拨错号码，“天机”就会泄露。
    日本是世界上传真机普及率最高的国家，也是传真机第一生产大国，世界传真机市场基本上为日本所控制。不过美国和西欧各国正在急起直追。
    在第三世界国家，传真机使用量也日益增多。由于传真机可以满足信息传递的快、真、准、全等要求，可以想见，过不了几年，传真机的使用将会像电话一样普及。
