The Baoding Municipal Committee of the Communist Party of China has, in recent years, relied on institutional mechanisms to standardize the selection, cultivation, and use of reserve cadres, achieving the goal of preparing for use and ensuring that the prepared are useful. This has effectively overcome the issues of impromptu nominations, hasty appointments, and personnel errors. Over the past two years, 86% of the promoted cadres came from the reserve cadre pool.

In the process of selecting reserve cadres, the Baoding Municipal Committee's Organization Department has worked to increase transparency, ensuring that the selection is based on broad public participation. Over the past five years, they have organized various forms of democratic recommendations, including recommendations from informants, letters and visits, and public meetings. In a 1986 activity to recommend county-level reserve cadres, over 92,000 people participated in the recommendations, resulting in 103 county-level reserve cadres being recommended, of whom 17 have since been promoted to county-level leadership positions. These cadres are known for their clean governance, pioneering spirit, and notable achievements, earning the support of the people.

The Baoding Municipal Committee's Organization Department has also reformed the evaluation methods for reserve cadres, moving away from the outdated practice of relying solely on discussions to understand their qualifications. In recent years, they have implemented a quantitative evaluation system for the moral and intellectual qualities of reserve cadres, enhancing comparability. They have also introduced a competitive mechanism, transforming static evaluations into dynamic ones, and shifting from "selecting horses" to "racing horses." They have adopted various forms such as public bidding, selection, recruitment, qualification reviews, competitive debates, and expert and public evaluations, embodying the principles of openness, democracy, equality, and merit-based selection. This has helped to overcome the phenomenon of cadres who can only be promoted and not demoted, and the issue of "frequent losers often taking command." For example, last year, in the selection of a municipal committee secretary, 32 young cadres applied, with 28 participating in the preliminary selection exam. The top 9 candidates proceeded to a speech and debate, and the top 3 underwent performance evaluations, ultimately selecting the most suitable candidate.

To ensure the quality of reserve cadres, the municipal committee has annually adjusted the reserve cadre team over the past few years, promptly selecting outstanding talents and eliminating those who fall short. Last year alone, the entire region had 134 new entries and 58 exits from the team, with all internal cadres having specific cultivation measures in place.

Statistics show that since 1984, 72 cadres have entered the county-level leadership team. Last year, the municipal committee's Organization Department, through investigations, found that among the 17 cadres with average performance, only 1 was promoted from the reserve cadre pool.

　　克服临时提名仓促选人用人失误现象    
    保定地委靠制度保证后备干部质量
    本报讯  河北省保定地委近年来依靠制度规范后备干部的选拔、培养和使用工作，做到为用而备，备而有用，较好地克服了临时提名、仓促选人、用人失误的现象。两年来，从后备干部中提拔的干部占晋升干部总数的８６％。
    在选拔后备干部的工作中，保定地委组织部努力增强透明度，使之建立在群众广泛参与的基础上。五年来，他们每年都组织不同形式的民主推荐，包括信息员推荐、来信来访推荐、群众大会推荐等。在１９８６年组织的一次推荐县级后备干部活动中，全区就有９２０００多人参与推荐，共推荐出县级后备干部１０３人，其中有１７人已被提拔到县级领导岗位。这些干部清廉施政，勇于开拓，有政绩都比较出色，赢得了群众的拥护。
    保定地委组织部在对后备干部的考察上，改变过去单纯依靠座谈了解的陈旧方法，近年来对后备干部实行德才素质量化测评，增强了可比性。他们还引入竞争机制，把静态考察进一步转为动态考察，变“相马”为“赛马”，先后采用了公开竞争招标、招选、招聘中资格审查、竞争答辩、专家和群众评议等形式，体现了公开、民主、平等、择优的原则，克服了干部只能上不能下、“常败将军常挂帅”的现象。例如，去年在招选团地委书记一职时，有３２名青年干部报名，其中２８名参加了预选考试，前９名参加演讲答辩，又取其前３名进行实绩考察，最后确定一名最合适者中选。
    为保证后备干部的质量，几年来，地委年年对后备干部队伍进行调整，把优秀人才及时选进，把相形见绌者淘汰，仅去年全区就“新补入队”１３４人，“调整出队”５８人，队内干部都落实了培养措施。
    据统计，１９８４年以来，全区共有７２名干部进入县级领导班子，去年地委组织部经过考察发现，在１７名表现一般的干部中，从后备干部中提拔的只有１名。　　　　　　　　（李成福　李战才　霍林）
