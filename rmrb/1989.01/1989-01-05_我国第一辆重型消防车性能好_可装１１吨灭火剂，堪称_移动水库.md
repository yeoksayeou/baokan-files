China's first heavy-duty foam fire truck, developed by the Baoji Fire Equipment Factory under the Ministry of Public Security, recently passed a department-level appraisal in Baoji. It fills a domestic gap and changes the situation where heavy-duty fire vehicles have long relied on imports.

This CPF20 model heavy-duty foam fire truck can carry 11 tons of fire-fighting agents and is a special heavy-duty combat vehicle. The truck has features such as high horsepower, multiple loading parameters, corrosion resistance, good acceleration performance, safety, reliability, and convenient operation and maintenance. It can be used to extinguish fires involving flammable liquids and general materials. It has the capability of a "mobile water reservoir," ensuring that fire-fighting operations are not delayed due to a lack of fire-fighting agents.

　　我国第一辆重型消防车性能好
    可装１１吨灭火剂，堪称“移动水库”
    本报讯  公安部宝鸡消防器材总厂研制的我国第一辆２５吨重型泡沫消防车，最近在宝鸡通过部级鉴定。它填补了国内空白，改变了重型消防车辆长期依赖进口的局面。
    这种型号为ＣＰＰ２０的重型泡沫消防车，可装载１１吨灭火剂，系特种重型汽车战斗车辆。该车具有马力大、装载参数多、耐腐蚀、加速性能好、安全可靠、操纵和维修方便等特点，可用于扑救易燃液体和一般物质火灾。它有“移动水库”之效能，不会因灭火剂不足而贻误战机。
