Title: Varieties of Cuisine

	I had the fortune of attending a high-standard banquet. After a few dishes were served, I felt that they were not much different from lower-standard dishes. I quietly asked a familiar female server. She smiled slightly and gestured with her mouth towards the cold dish placed in the center of the dining table, "All the value is in it." She told me that just the "Peacock Displaying Its Tail" cold dish alone costs 150 yuan, and two chefs spent a whole day carving and arranging it. I took a closer look, and the peacock's head in the "Peacock Displaying Its Tail" was carved from a radish, the tail was carved from cucumber skin, and the body was made from smoked chicken meat, just more finely processed, with an actual value of about 10 yuan! "Time is money," and it is applied here. Unfortunately, until the banquet ended, no one had touched this cold dish.

	In recent years, the trend of carving radish flowers and meticulously arranging cold dishes has been on the rise. The chefs in large hotels naturally have superior skills, and the chefs in small restaurants are not willing to fall behind. The cooks in unit canteens also occasionally show off their skills, and even some housewives start carving and arranging, with a trend of carving more and arranging finer, and even giving it a name: promoting the country's culinary culture.

	I do not oppose using radish flowers to decorate a banquet or arranging cold dishes into simple shapes of flowers, birds, fish, and animals. But it cannot be like the current situation where it is rampant, wasting labor and time, and charging high prices. Guests say that they cannot bear to pick up their chopsticks when they see such beautiful shapes; in fact, they are afraid of the dirt and cannot bear to pick up their chopsticks. Think about it, after a few people have carved and arranged it for a day, even if they pay attention to hygiene, it is hard to avoid being dirty; not to mention that some cooked meat products, after being handled for a long time, will no longer be fresh. High prices and inedible, if it can meet the standard and be displayed in an art gallery for people to appreciate, it would not be in vain, but I am afraid it would spoil in a day.

	Our country's cuisine emphasizes color, aroma, taste, shape, and utensils, which is already a bit superficial. Adding this "carving and arranging art" that is only for display and not for eating, isn't it even more superficial!

	I think that contemporary chefs with ideals and achievements should focus more on practical matters. Based on maintaining the excellent traditions of our country's culinary arts, they should pay attention to the nutrition of the dishes and provide each diner with a reasonable nutritional ratio. This is the right way to develop our country's culinary industry and enrich our country's culinary culture.

### 饮食的花样

　　饮食的花样
    有幸参加了一次标准较高的宴会。几道菜肴上过之后，觉得与标准较低的菜肴并无甚差别，便悄声问一个我熟悉的女服务员。她微微一笑，用嘴示意摆在餐桌中央的冷盘，“全贵在它身上了”。她告诉我，光一个“孔雀开屏”冷拼就一百五十元，两个师傅雕刻、拼摆了一天。我细观之，这个“孔雀开屏”的孔雀头是萝卜雕的，屏是黄瓜皮刻的，身子是熏鸡肉堆的，只是加工较细而已，实际价值大概十元足矣！“时间就是金钱”，竟应用在这上头了。可惜直至宴会散了，这个冷盘仍无一人问津。
    近年来，雕萝卜花、细摆冷拼之风日盛。大饭店的厨师自然技高一筹，小饭馆的厨师不甘落后，单位食堂的炊事员也不时露一手，甚至有些家庭主妇也雕拼起来，大有越雕越大，越拼越细之势，还美其名曰：发扬祖国的饮食文化。
    我不反对在宴会上用萝卜花点缀一下，把冷拼摆成花、鸟、鱼、兽等简单造型。但决不能像目前这样泛滥成灾，耗工耗时，索价又高。食客嘴上说看着这样美好的造型艺术，不忍下箸；其实，是嫌它太脏，不敢下箸。你想，几个人用手雕、拼了一天，再注意卫生，也难免不干不净；更何况一些熟肉制品摆弄了久了，味道也就不新鲜了。价高而无法食用，倘若够标准摆进艺术馆仅供人参观也算不白费功夫，又恐怕放不了一天就得变质。
    我国菜肴讲究色、香、味、形、器，这本来就有一点虚，再加上只摆不吃的“雕、拼艺术”，不是更虚了吗！
    我以为当代有理想、有作为的厨师，与其在雕、拼上下功夫，不如实在些，在保持我国烹饪优良传统的根底上，注重菜肴的营养，给每位就餐者提供合理的营养配比，这才是发展我国的烹饪事业，丰富我国的饮食文化之正道。  李郁秀
