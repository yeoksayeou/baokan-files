In October 1988, a peculiar incident occurred in Nanbu County, Sichuan Province, a national model county for greening: The Party Secretary and Mayor of Anba Township, who had previously enthusiastically organized and assisted farmers in planting trees, suddenly changed their stance. They mobilized the entire township to cut down bamboo, personally conducting a pilot project in five villages, cutting down 10 acres of bamboo. Subsequently, they required every household to participate, setting a deadline for inspection, and imposing fines for those who missed the deadline. In less than half a month, the entire township destroyed 100 acres of bamboo forest, amounting to 125,000 kilograms.

Coincidentally, the famous greening model unit in Sichuan, Sanhe Township in Bazhong County, also saw a trend of cutting down "wild field trees." Local officials, citing that the shade from trees on the edges of fields was too dense and affected crop growth, issued a regulation that all trees within four feet of the field edges must be cut down...

It is understood that similar incidents have also occurred in other places where forestry development is rapid and effective.

Standing under the banners of "Advanced County in Greening," I am confused. However, the real confusion lies with the local leaders. Below is a record of their heartfelt words to me:

"Forestry cannot be developed, and our days are hard; forestry is developed, and our days are not much better. Although we have received awards, been featured in newspapers, and had higher-level leaders praise our forests, our hearts are warm, but once they leave, our hearts turn cold again. Look, there are so many bamboo trees here. This stuff is very cheap in our place. In the past, farmers used a lot of bamboo to build thatched houses, and it could still fetch a good price. Now, most houses have been converted to tiled roofs, and bamboo can only be sold for one jiao per kilogram. Farmers gain little, and the local economy does not improve. As township or county leaders, we have a three-year term. If we cannot help farmers get rich quickly, it will be hard to face our fellow villagers when we step down.

"Grain and money are hard indicators, while bamboo and wood are soft indicators. Everyone says that ecological and social benefits should be good, but no matter how good you say it is, when it comes to evaluating officials, it's still grain and money. Forestry loses money and grain, who wants to engage in this losing business? In the past few years, the province has been strict on forestry, and the prefectures and counties have paid attention. We grassroots officials also had the energy, and being a bit tired was nothing. Now the momentum has weakened, and we want to focus on other businesses that show results quickly. After all, who doesn't want their hometown to turn green with mountains and clear with water? Planting trees takes 10 to 20 years to mature. Now we have many young and middle-aged forests that need pruning and tending, but we dare not touch them. If we prune, where do we sell these materials? If the price is too low, it will greatly damage the farmers' morale."

I learned from relevant departments that Sichuan Province has over 10 million acres of young and middle-aged forests that have entered the pruning and tending period. How to make the internal structure of forestry correspondingly matched, turn resource advantages into commodity and economic advantages, and enhance the momentum of forestry has become urgent. If the problem cannot be well solved, it will inevitably affect the enthusiasm of grassroots afforestation and greening.

### 绿化先进县的困惑

　　绿化先进县的困惑
    四川  吴开翔
    １９８８年１０月，全国绿化先进县的四川省南部县发生了一桩怪事：前些年曾热情组织帮助农民植树造林的安坝乡党委书记、乡长一反常态，动员全乡大砍竹子，并亲自搞试点，在五村砍竹１０亩，接着要求户户动手，限期验收，超过限期还要罚款。不到半月，全乡毁掉竹林１００亩、１万窝，达１２５万公斤。
    无独有偶。闻名全川的绿化先进单位巴中县三合乡也刮起一股砍“荒田树”的歪风。当地干部以田坎地边的树荫蔽太大，影响作物生长为由作出规定，田边４尺内的树木要全部砍掉……
    据了解，在其他林业发展快、成效显著的地方也发生了类似的事。
    站在一面面“绿化先进县”的锦旗下，我困惑了。然而，真正的困惑应该说是地方领导。下面记述的是他们向我倾诉的心里话：
    “林业搞不起来，我们日子不好过；林业起来了，我们的日子也好不了多少。虽然奖状拿了，报上登了，上级领导看了林子，夸奖一番，我们心里热乎乎的，可他们一走，心又凉了。你看，这里有好多竹子，这东西在我们这里贱得很。过去农民盖草房用竹多，还卖得起价，现在大多改成瓦房了，竹子只能卖一角钱一公斤。农民获利少，地方经济上不去。我们当乡长、县长的只有三年任期，不能使农民尽快脱贫致富，下台时也不好向父老乡亲交待。
    “粮钱是硬指标，竹木是软指标。生态效益、社会效益大家都说要好，但是你说得再好，一到考核干部还是一粮二钱。搞林业赔钱赔粮，谁愿老干这种赔本买卖？前些年，省里抓林业抓得紧，地县重视，我们基层干部也有劲，苦点、累点没啥。现在声势小了，我们就想抓一下别的见效快的行当了。话说回来，我们又何曾不想自己的家乡山变青、水变绿呢？栽树要１０年２０年才能成材，如今我们有很多中幼林应该进行间伐抚育，但不敢动。如果间伐，这些材往那里销？如果价卖得太低，要大伤农民元气。”
    我从有关方面了解到，四川省已有１０００多万亩中幼林进入抚育间伐期。如何使林业内部结构相应配套，使资源优势变为商品优势、经济优势，增强林业的后劲，已迫在眉睫。假若问题不能很好解决，必然影响基层造林绿化的积极性。
