	China's figure skating progress has been slow, with top athletes in poor form and no technical improvements. The People's Daily reported from Beijing on January 6 that there is a saying in the sports world that Chinese people often excel in technically demanding events. Theoretically, figure skating should suit the physical conditions of Chinese people, but it has always been stagnant. In international competitions, China often ends up at the bottom.

	The 14th World University Winter Games is approaching, and figure skaters are back in training. In 1985, Zhang Shubin from Heilongjiang won the men's singles gold medal at the 12th World University Winter Games. Can Chinese figure skaters repeat this success? Coach Miao Ruifu of the national figure skating team introduced the current situation of Chinese figure skating to reporters at the indoor ice rink of the Capital Gymnasium. She said that the prospects for this competition are slim. When Zhang Shubin won the championship, there was no compulsory figures event, but in this competition, Chinese athletes almost inevitably will stumble in the compulsory figures. Chinese figure skating has long neglected basic training and relies on a few triple or quadruple jumps, making it difficult to win medals. Our athletes have not yet overcome technical obstacles to enter the realm of performance.

	It is understood that several Chinese figure skating stars are in poor competitive condition, and young athletes are not yet able to replace them in competition.

　　我国花样滑冰运动进展缓慢
    名将状态不佳　技术不见起色
    本报北京１月６日讯  记者李北大报道：体育界有一种说法，中国人往往在技巧性较强的项目上成绩突出，按说花样滑冰项目适合中国人的身体条件，可是却一直徘徊不前，参加国际比赛常常垫底。
    第１４届世界大学生冬季运动会即将来临，花样滑冰选手又投入了集训。１９８５年，黑龙江运动员张述滨曾在第１２届世界大学生冬季运动会上荣获男子单人滑金牌。中国花样滑冰选手此次出征，能否再奏凯歌？国家花样滑冰队教练苗瑞馥在首都体育馆室内滑冰场边向记者介绍了我国花样滑冰的近况。她说，这次比赛，花样滑冰选手希望甚小，当年张述滨夺魁时没设规定图形滑，而这届大赛，中国队员几乎无法避免在规定图形滑上栽跟头。中国花样滑冰长期以来忽视基础训练，只靠几个三周半或四周跳很难拿奖牌。我国队员还没有摆脱技术障碍进入表演意境。
    据了解，我国几个花样滑冰名将竞技状态不佳，年轻选手尚难以顶替他们征战。
