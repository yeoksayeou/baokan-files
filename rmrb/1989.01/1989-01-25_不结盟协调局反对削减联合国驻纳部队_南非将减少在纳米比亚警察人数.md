The Non-Aligned Coordination Bureau today issued a statement criticizing "certain permanent members of the Security Council" for attempting to reduce the number of military personnel in the proposed United Nations Transition Assistance Group for Namibia.

The bureau, after holding an emergency meeting in New York today, said in a statement that South Africa has 100,000 soldiers and 100,000 policemen in Namibia, in addition to 24,000 to 35,000 local soldiers and paramilitary organization members.

The statement said that if the number of UN troops is less than the 4,500 stipulated in Security Council Resolution 435 on the issue of Namibian independence, it would be "difficult to restore the confidence of the Namibian people" and ensure their free participation in the election process.

According to reports, permanent members of the Security Council have proposed reducing the number of military personnel in the UN Transition Assistance Group to save costs and in view of the improved situation in southern Africa.

However, the statement by the Non-Aligned Coordination Bureau said that this proposal violates the spirit of Security Council Resolution 629 adopted this month. The resolution calls for all possible cost-saving measures but does not allow the UN Transition Assistance Group's mission to be compromised.

According to reports from South Africa, the South African authorities have informed the UN Secretary-General that during the transitional period from April 1 to November 1 this year, the number of policemen in Namibia will be reduced from the current 8,300 to 6,000.

　　不结盟协调局反对削减联合国驻纳部队    
    南非将减少在纳米比亚警察人数
    新华社联合国１月２３日电  不结盟国家协调局今天发表公报，批评“某些安理会常任理事国”试图减少拟议中联合国驻纳米比亚过渡时期援助团所含军事成员的人数。
    该局今天在纽约召开紧急会议后发表的一份公报指出，南非在纳米比亚驻有１０万名士兵和１０万名警察，此外还有２．４万至３．５万当地士兵和准军事组织成员。
    公报说，如果联合国部队人数少于安理会关于纳米比亚独立问题的４３５号决议规定的４５００人，将“很难恢复纳米比亚人民的信心”并确保他们自由参加选举程序。
    据报道，安理会常任理事国为了节省经费并考虑到南部非洲地区情况已有改善，提出了减少联合国过渡时期援助团中军事人员数量的建议。
    但不结盟国家协调局的公报说，这项建议违背了安理会于本月通过的６２９号决议的精神。该决议要求采取一切可能的节约措施，但不能损害联合国过渡时期援助团执行使命的能力。
    新华社哈博罗内１月２３日电　据来自南非的报道，南非当局已经通知联合国秘书长，从今年４月１日到１１月１日这段过渡时期里它在纳米比亚的警察人数将从目前的８３００人减少到６０００人。
