British Chancellor Nigel Lawson said that the meeting of finance ministers and central bank governors of the seven major industrialized Western countries (G7) may be held earlier than the scheduled April date, possibly within the next few weeks.

Lawson's remarks strengthened earlier speculations. It is estimated that the G7 finance ministers' meeting will be held soon after George Bush's formal inauguration as U.S. President on January 20.

Lawson revealed this information after his two-day visit to Washington. It is reported that he had a "brief private meeting" with U.S. Treasury Secretary Nicholas Brady to discuss matters of international concern.

Lawson's speech today indicates that major disagreements over holding the G7 finance ministers' meeting earlier are being resolved. Britain's stance has been that holding the meeting earlier would not have much visible effect. Apart from the United States, several other major countries previously seemed to think that there was no urgent need to hold the meeting earlier.

### 英国财政大臣奈杰尔·劳森说  西方七国财长会议可望提前举行

　　英国财政大臣奈杰尔·劳森说
    西方七国财长会议可望提前举行
    据新华社伦敦１月１２日电  （记者李宗扬）英国财政大臣奈杰尔·劳森今天在议会下院辩论时说，西方七个主要工业发达国家（七国集团）的财政部长和中央银行行长会议，可能从预定的４月份提前到“今后几周内”举行。
    劳森的讲话加强了此间人士早有的猜测。人们估计，七国集团财长会议将在１月２０日乔治·布什正式就任美国总统后不久举行。
    劳森是在他两天前出访华盛顿后透露这一信息的。据报道，他曾同美国财政部长尼古拉斯·布雷迪进行了“一次短暂的私人会见以讨论国际关注的事务”。
    劳森今天的讲话表明，提前召开七国集团财长会议的重大分歧正在消除。英国的态度一直是，提前举行这一会议不会有太多的可见效果。除美国外，其他几个主要国家从前也似乎认为并没有提前召开这一会议的紧迫需要。
