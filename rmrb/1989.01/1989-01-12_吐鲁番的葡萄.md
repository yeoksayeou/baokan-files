The Grapes of Turpan

By Reporter Zhu Bixian

"Turpan's grapes are ripe, and Anarkhan's heart is intoxicated..." The sweet voice of Guan Mucun's song has drifted into countless homes, making people hear the sound and seem to smell the fragrance of Turpan's grapes.

Just as the song goes, the Uyghur people always serve grapes when entertaining guests. During the grape harvest season, we came to the grape-growing village of Turpan City in Xinjiang. Walking along the streets, we saw that the courtyards of every household along the way were shaded by grapevines. Entering the home of Uyghur farmer Shadarshadik, several elderly women and young girls were resting under the grape arbor. The grapes hanging above their heads were crystal clear and very tempting. The male owner was not at home, and the female owner, Guoyuhan, enthusiastically invited us to sit down. Her daughter immediately stood on a stool, cut down some grapes, put them in a bowl, and placed them on the table for us to taste. When asked how much income the grapes in the courtyard yield each year, the female owner waved her hand and said, "These are horse milk grapes, we don't sell them, we only keep them for ourselves to eat and to entertain guests." She proudly talked about how last spring, when the grapes were just on the vines, the Turkish president came to visit and took a photo with her family. To prove that this was true, she led us into the room and showed us a framed color photo on the wall for us to see.

The Grape Valley is located on the eastern side of the Flaming Mountains, which run through the center of the Turpan Basin. It is a gorge in the Flaming Mountains, 8 kilometers long and less than 1 kilometer wide, with dozens of varieties of grapes planted, producing millions of kilograms of fresh grapes each year. The grapes growing everywhere are like a stream of clear water flowing down the slopes of the Flaming Mountains, bringing freshness and coolness to the people. Therefore, in addition to being eaten, the grape arbors also serve another function: providing shade. You can see that under every grape arbor, there are chairs, tables, and even small beds. In the summer nights, people almost always rest here. After all, the Flaming Mountains got their name not only because their red peaks and bare ridges appear reddish-brown and seem to be burning with flames under the sunlight, but also because the temperature in Turpan is indeed high. There are more than 5 months of summer each year, with over 40 days when the temperature exceeds 40 degrees Celsius. The Grape Valley naturally becomes an ideal place to avoid the heat and enjoy grapes.

The economic value of grapes seems to have been overlooked for a long time. Although the history of grape cultivation in the Turpan region is long, it was recorded as early as the Northern Liang period (424-441 AD). In the unearthed documents from the Astana Ancient Tombs in Turpan, there were documents appointing officials to manage the irrigation of grape fields, such as the "Functionary's Order to Appoint the Water Official." However, the development of grape production has been extremely slow. In addition to historical and geographical reasons (such as poor transportation and the inability to export fresh grapes), has the recognition of the value of grapes also been biased, limiting its development? From the perspective of varieties, among many varieties, only seedless white grapes and their variants, large seedless white and long seedless white, can be dried. Most are eaten fresh, and only in recent years have some varieties suitable for winemaking, such as Northern Muscat and White Wing, been introduced. After liberation, the development of grape production cannot be said to be fast, and the "Cultural Revolution" decade was even more of a low point. Until 1977, the procurement volume of dried grapes was still very small, and the commercial rate was extremely low. Some villages' farmers had to rely on the state to return a small amount of dried grapes to taste. Among the eight ethnic minorities in Xinjiang, the Uyghurs have the strongest commercial awareness, but it is probably only in recent years that this has been fully revealed. In 1979, the Turpan region established a grape production base, and Turpan grapes began to show their unique charm in the commodity economy. According to statistics from 1985 alone, in just 7 years, 39,513 tons of grape wine, 3,013 tons of grape canned products, and 19,753 tons of dried grapes were produced, of which 6,073 tons were exported, and 7,099 tons of fresh grapes were also exported.

We then walked towards the home of Naisier. The blue-painted brick walls, the open doors, the lush grapevines in the courtyard, the low flower walls in the middle of the courtyard, a few folding beds by the wall, and two long rectangular tables in the center, with food for entertaining guests on them. In the back courtyard, three women were sifting wheat, seemingly the daughters-in-law. They occasionally looked up to answer our questions, but they never put down their work. A colleague suggested placing some smoke in the courtyard to make the grape photos taken more effective, but this was politely declined: "This will damage the grapes. Just now, a foreigner came and proposed to pour water on the grapes for him to take photos, and we also did not agree." I was secretly pleased: the hospitable owners of the Grape Valley also know how to protect their own interests. Now, in addition to planting fresh-eating grape varieties, most courtyards in the Grape Valley also plant seedless white grapes that can be dried. The owner of one household told me that this alone brings in over 700 yuan a year. Curious, I poked my head into a "group structure," where the room was full of wooden stakes. I saw strings of dried grapes hanging from the wooden stakes, greenish-yellow, shining with a crystal-like luster.

　　吐鲁番的葡萄
    本报记者  朱碧森
    “吐鲁番的葡萄熟了，阿娜尔汗的心儿醉了……”关牧村甜美的歌声，曾飘进千家万户，让人们听其声便似乎闻到了吐鲁番葡萄的香味。
    正像歌中所唱，维吾尔族群众款待客人少不了葡萄。葡萄收获的季节，我们来到新疆吐鲁番市葡萄乡，沿街走去，但见路边家家户户的院子都是葡萄绿荫。走进维吾尔族农民沙达尔沙迪克的家，几位老妇人和年轻姑娘正在葡萄架下乘凉，她们的头顶上一串串晶莹的葡萄甚是诱人。男主人不在家，女主人古约汗热情地请我们坐下，她女儿立即站到凳子上，剪下葡萄盛在盆子里端到桌上，请我们品尝。问起庭院里栽的葡萄每年可获得多少收入，女主人摆摆手说：“这里种的是马奶子葡萄，不卖，只留给自己吃和招待客人。”她自豪地说起，去年春天葡萄刚上架时，土耳其的总统来参观过，还和她一家人合了影。为证明此话不虚，她领我们进到房间里，指着墙上镜框里的一张彩照让我们看。
    葡萄沟位于横亘吐鲁番盆地中央的火焰山的东面，是火焰山的一条峡谷，全沟长８公里，宽不到１公里，种植了好几十种葡萄，每年能产数以百万公斤计的鲜葡萄。遍地生长的葡萄，就像流淌在火焰山坡的一股清泉，赐给人们以清新凉爽。因此，一架架葡萄，除了食用，还有一种功能，就是供人们乘凉。你可以见到家家的葡萄架下，都摆着椅子、桌子甚至小床。夏夜，人们几乎都在这儿歇息。要知道，火焰山得名，不仅仅因为它的赤峰秃岭呈赭红色，在阳光照射下如燃着熊熊大火，还因为吐鲁番的气温确实高，一年有５个多月的夏季，气温超过４０摄氏度的在４０天以上。葡萄沟自然成为避暑胜地和品尝葡萄的最好场所。
    葡萄的经济价值很长时间似乎被忽略了。尽管吐鲁番地区种植葡萄的历史悠久，北凉时（公元４２４—４４１年）就有了记载。吐鲁番阿斯塔那古墓的出土文献中，曾发现有任命专管葡萄地用水的官员的文件“功曹条任行水官文书”。但葡萄生产的发展速度极缓慢，除了历史的、地理的原因（诸如交通不发达，鲜葡萄无法输出等），人们对葡萄价值的认识是否也存在偏差而限制它的发展呢？仅从品种看，诸多品种中，只有无核白葡萄及其变异品种大无核白和长无核白是可以制干的，大多为鲜食，近年才引进了一些酿造品种如北醇和白羽。解放后，葡萄生产发展速度不能说快，“文革”１０年更是跌入低谷。直到１９７７年，葡萄干收购量还很少，商品率极低。有的村子农民要品尝一点葡萄干，还得靠国家返销。新疆的８个少数民族中，维吾尔人的商品观念最强，但恐怕也是近几年才充分显露出来。１９７９年吐鲁番地区建立了葡萄生产基地，吐鲁番葡萄在商品经济中开始展示了独特的风姿。仅据１９８５年统计，７年间就生产葡萄酒３９５１３吨，葡萄罐头３０１３吨，收购葡萄干１９７５３吨，其中出口６０７３吨，还出口了７０９９吨鲜葡萄。
    我们又向乃斯尔家走去。漆成蓝色的砖墙，敞开的大门，院子里葡萄架浓绿成荫，院子中间围有低矮的花墙，墙旁摆几张行军床，中央两张长方形条桌，案上摆满了招待客人的食品。后院有３个妇女在筛选麦子，看样子身份是儿媳妇。她们不时抬起头回答我们的问话，但一直没有放下手中的活。有位随行的同志建议在院子里放一会儿烟雾，以便使拍摄的葡萄照片效果更佳，遭到了婉言拒绝：“这会把葡萄弄坏的，刚才有个外国人来，提出要给葡萄泼上水让他拍照，我们也没答应。”我心中暗喜：好客的葡萄沟主人也懂得维护自己的利益了。现在葡萄沟的庭院除种植鲜食的葡萄品种外，大多还种可制干的无核白。有一家主人告诉我，仅这一项一年收入７００多元。我好奇地钻进一间“群结”，满屋木桩，只见垂挂在木桩上的一串串葡萄干，绿中透黄，闪着晶莹的光泽。
