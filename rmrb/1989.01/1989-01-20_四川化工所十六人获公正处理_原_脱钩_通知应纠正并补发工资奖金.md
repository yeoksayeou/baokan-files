The Sichuan provincial government, after an investigation, recently decided on the issue of the Sichuan Chemical Research Institute's forced "disassociation" of 16 scientific researchers who had been approved to leave their posts to establish a technology entity. The decision states: the "disassociation" notice should be corrected, and the wages, bonuses, and labor insurance of the 16 scientific researchers that were withheld should be reimbursed.

On August 20 of last year, the Sichuan Chemical Research Institute suddenly issued a notice requiring Wang Mingyu and 16 other scientific researchers to "immediately return their work certificates to the labor and personnel department, and hand over all experimental rooms, equipment, instruments, drugs, and office supplies they had been using. All internal agreements signed with the institute would naturally be nullified." Starting from September, their wages, labor insurance, and bonuses were officially stopped, and they were ordered to move out of the research institute's housing (see the detailed report on the third page of this newspaper on September 16, 1988).

After this newspaper exposed the incident, the relevant leaders of the Sichuan provincial government paid great attention to it and instructed the provincial Science and Technology Commission, the provincial Chemical Industry Bureau, the provincial Organization Department, and the provincial Personnel Bureau to form a joint investigation team. The investigation team listened to the opinions of both parties and the staff of the Chemical Research Institute, clarified the facts, and did a lot of coordination work. However, the differences between the two parties were too great, and they could not reach a consensus.

The investigation team believed that the Sichuan Chemical Research Institute and the "San Tong Institute" established by Wang Mingyu and others are two independent scientific institutions. The institute's request to rationalize the relationship is reasonable, but the notice issued was inappropriate, and the handling method was improper. Without consulting the individuals involved, the institute implemented a forced "disassociation," which is not in line with the current talent mobility policy.

At the same time, they proposed that to ensure the development of both institutes and the rational flow of talent, the relationship between the two in terms of personnel, funds, and materials must be rationalized. According to the spirit of the current documents of Sichuan Province, for Wang Mingyu and the 16 scientific researchers, those who wish to work at the "San Tong Institute" should submit a written application to the Chemical Research Institute, clearly stating the form of mobility (transfer, resignation, unpaid leave, paid leave, part-time, etc.), and after approval, handle the mobility procedures. For those who apply to flow to the "San Tong Institute" in the form of leaving their posts, the provincial Chemical Research Institute should support them. For those who wish to continue working at the Sichuan Chemical Research Institute, the institute should not discriminate against them and should treat them equally with other employees. For other technical and economic rights issues involved in this incident, both parties have filed lawsuits with the court and requested economic compensation. Administrative organs are not in a position to arbitrate.

　　四川化工所十六人获公正处理
    原“脱钩”通知应纠正并补发工资奖金
    本报成都１月１９日电  记者罗茂城报道：四川省政府经过调查，日前就化学工业研究所强制被批准离岗办科技实体的王铭玉等１６名科研人员“脱钩”一事作出决定：“脱钩”通知应予纠正，１６名科研人员被扣的工资、奖金、劳保均应补发。
    去年８月２０日，四川省化工所突然发出通知，要王铭玉等１６名科研人员将“工作证立即交回劳动人事科，原占用的试验室、设备、仪器、药品及其办公用具一律交出，原来与所里签订的一切内部协议自然消失。”从９月份起，正式停发了他们的工资、劳保和奖金，并要他们搬出研究所的住宅（详见本报去年９月１６日第３版）。
    本报披露此事以后，四川省政府有关领导十分重视，批示由省科委、省化工厅、省委组织部、省人事局组成联合调查组。调查组广泛听取了双方及化工所干部职工的意见，弄清了事实真相，并做了大量协调工作，但双方分歧太大，无法达成一致意见。
    调查组认为，四川省化工所与王铭玉等人离岗兴办的科技实体“三通所”，是两个相互独立的科技机构。化工所提出理顺关系的要求是合理的，但是所发通知引文不当，处理方法欠妥。在未征求本人意见的情况下，实行强制“脱钩”，与现行人才流动政策不符。
    同时，他们提出，为保证两所的发展和人才合理流动，必须理顺相互之间在人、财、物等方面的关系。根据四川省现行文件精神，对王铭玉等１６名科研人员，愿到“三通所”工作的，由本人向化工所提出书面申请，明确流动形式（调离、辞职、停薪留职、带薪带职、兼职等），经批准后办理流动手续。对提出以留职形式向“三通所”流动的，省化工所应予支持。对愿继续留在省化工所工作的，省化工所对他们不得歧视，应与其他职工一视同仁。对这次事件中涉及的其它技术经济权益问题，双方均已向法院起诉，并要求经济赔偿，行政机关不便仲裁。
