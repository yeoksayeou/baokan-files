Japan's 1988 trade volume reached an all-time high, with the European Community's trade deficit with Japan increasing.

BEIJING, Jan. 19 (Xinhua) — Japan's 1988 export volume was $264.866 billion, a 15.6% increase from 1987. The import volume was $187.474 billion, a 25.4% increase from 1987. Both export and import volumes set historical records. This was revealed in the 1988 trade statistics released by Japan's Ministry of Finance yesterday.

Yesterday, the Japanese government approved the 1989 economic plan. It is estimated that the actual economic growth rate will be 4.0%. Of this, the domestic demand growth rate will be 4.7%, and the foreign demand growth rate will be -0.7%. The economy will continue to achieve stable growth led by personal consumption and equipment investment.

BRUSSELS, Jan. 19 (Xinhua) — The European Community today expressed regret over the further deterioration of the trade imbalance between Europe and Japan, and demanded that Japan make greater efforts to change the situation.

Statistics released by the Japanese side on the 18th showed that in 1988, although the European Community's exports to Japan increased by 36.2% compared to 1987, reaching $24.07 billion, Japan's exports to the Community also saw a significant increase (24.3%), reaching $46.87 billion. This resulted in a $22.8 billion trade deficit for the Community with Japan, an increase of $3.39 billion from 1987.
