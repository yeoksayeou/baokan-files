The economic reform experimental zone in Hulunbuir League, Inner Mongolia, has achieved the expected results in its construction over the past year. By correctly utilizing the policies and authorities granted by the central government, the zone has focused on its local resources, geographical location, and economic and social development status. It has taken opening up and development as the breakthrough point to carry out economic and trade activities with the Soviet Union, Mongolia, and Eastern Europe as the main targets. It has expanded cooperation with inland regions, introduced funds, technology, and talent, and transformed local abundant resources into economic achievements.

Last year, the experimental zone signed nearly 100 contracts with foreign entities, with a barter trade volume of 45 million Swiss francs and a cash trade volume of 5 million US dollars. It completed foreign trade procurement worth 110 million yuan and cooperated with inland regions on 154 new projects, which can increase the output value by 340 million yuan. It introduced 150 million yuan in funds, which is 6.3 times the amount in 1987. Opening up has promoted development, and last year, the league's gross national product reached 2.28 billion yuan, an increase of 11.7% over the previous year, exceeding the national average growth rate. Grain production reached a historic high, with a total output of 920 million kilograms and a commercial rate of 54%, surpassing the highest grain commercial rate in Jilin Province.

Inner Mongolia's Hulunbuir League is located in the middle segment of the Eurasian land bridge to the Soviet Union and Eastern Europe. It has five banners and cities bordering the Soviet Union and Mongolia, with a border line of 1,700 kilometers. The area is rich in resources and has the potential for comprehensive development, playing an important role in China's economic structure. On January 18 last year, the State Council approved Hulunbuir League as an economic reform experimental zone and determined that in terms of planning, foreign trade, finance, materials, labor, and other aspects, it would generally exercise the management and approval authority of the autonomous region level. Subsequently, the league committee and the league government formulated the policy of "opening the country's gates wide, connecting both ends, and opening one side," that is, using the existing three ports of Manzhouli to connect with the Soviet Union and Eastern Europe, passing through coastal areas to connect with Hong Kong and Macao, and developing border trade with the Soviet Union and Mongolia in a vast border area. This has led to the most active year of foreign trade. After Manzhouli opened to the Soviet Union, Ergun Right Banner and Chenbaerhu Banner successively negotiated and signed contracts with the Soviet side. Hailar, Zhalantun, and Yakeshi cities are also opening to the Soviet Union. Last year, the Manzhouli import and export trade fair received 7 Soviet regional economic and trade delegations, signing trade agreements worth more than 20 million Swiss francs. So far, 70 agreements or contracts have been signed with the Soviet Union, and more than 20 delegations have been sent to each other for inspections and visits. Trade cooperation with Mongolia is also underway. Meanwhile, cash trade with Japan and Hong Kong regions has been unprecedentedly active, and the United States, West Germany, the Netherlands, Denmark, the United Kingdom, and other countries have successively established cooperative relations.

While opening up to the outside world, the experimental zone attracts inland regions with preferential policies to develop resources and share resources. It has focused on developing a number of construction projects. Last year, the experimental zone completed a total investment of 350 million yuan, of which 53 million yuan was introduced, accounting for 15%. It completed 92 projects, forming an annual output value of 100 million yuan. The 134 projects under construction will add 300 million yuan in output value once completed and put into operation.

Currently, dozens of domestic and foreign businessmen have established offices and dispatched representatives to Hulunbuir League. To meet the needs of opening up and improve the investment environment, the experimental zone has built 92 kilometers of new roads, improved the Hailar Airport, and added three power plants and power transmission projects.

　　开放北大门　架设欧亚桥    
    北方试验区呼伦贝尔建设取得预期效果    
    外贸内联空前活跃　资源优势迅速转为经济成果
    本报讯  记者魏亚南报道：一年多来，位于我国北方的经济体制改革试验区——内蒙古呼伦贝尔盟，正确运用中央给予的政策和权利，从本地资源、地理位置、经济和社会发展现状出发，以开放、开发为突破口，开展对苏联、蒙古及东欧为重点的经济贸易，扩大与内地的联合，引进资金、技术和人才，将当地丰富的资源转化为经济成果，取得了试验区建设的预期效果。
    去年，试验区已对外签订近百项合同，易货贸易额４５００万瑞士法郎，现汇贸易５００万美元，完成外贸收购１．１亿元；与内地协作新项目１５４个，可增产值３．４亿元，已引进资金１．５亿元，是１９８７年的６．３倍。开放促发展，去年全盟国民生产总值达２２．８亿元，比上一年增长１１．７％，超过全国平均速度。粮食生产创历史最高水平，总产９．２亿公斤，商品率达到５４％，超过全国粮食商品率最高的吉林省。
    内蒙古自治区呼伦贝尔盟处于通往苏联和东欧的欧亚大陆桥中段，有五个旗市与苏联、蒙古接壤，边境线长达１７００公里。这里资源丰富，具有综合开发的潜在优势，在我国经济结构中占有重要位置。去年１月１８日，国务院批准呼伦贝尔盟为经济体制改革试验区，同时确定，在计划、外贸、财政、物资、劳动等方面，原则上行使自治区一级的管理权限和审批权。随后盟委、盟公署制订了大开国门，“打通两端，网开一面”的方针，即以现有的满洲里等三个口岸为依托通向苏联和东欧，通过沿海地区与港澳相通，在广大边境地域与苏联、蒙古开展边境贸易，迎来了对外贸易最活跃的一年。满洲里对苏开放以后，额尔古纳右旗、陈巴尔虎旗相继与苏方谈判签约，海拉尔、扎兰屯、牙克石三市也在对苏开放中。去年来，满洲里一次进出口交易会就接待了苏方７个地区的经贸代表团，签约贸易额２０００多万瑞士法郎。现已对苏签订了７０项协议或合同，双边已派２０多个团组相互考察访问；对蒙古的贸易合作正在进行，同时，与日本和香港地区的现汇贸易空前活跃，美国、西德、荷兰、丹麦、英国等也相继上门建立合作关系。
    在对外开放的同时，试验区靠优惠政策吸引内地，开发资源，分享资源，现已重点开发了一批建设项目。去年，试验区完成投资总额３．５亿元，其中引进资金５３００万元，占１５％，当年竣工９２项，已形成年产值１亿元的能力，正在建设中的１３４项，全部建成投产后将新增产值３亿元。
    目前，国内外客商来呼盟建立办事机构、派驻代表已有数十家。为适应开放需要，改善投资环境，试验区新修公路９２公里，改进了海拉尔机场，增设发电厂及输变电工程三处。
