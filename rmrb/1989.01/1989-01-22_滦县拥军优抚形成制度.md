Luan County Establishes System for Supporting and Comforting Soldiers

    The county committee and government of Luan County in Hebei Province have taken concrete steps to support and comfort soldiers, focusing more on practical actions rather than mere visits and banquets. This shift has transformed the work from being seasonal and sporadic to regular and institutionalized, yielding noticeable results.

    In response to new situations in rural areas, the county committee and government formulated specific measures at the end of 1987. These measures address issues such as providing land for housing, coal for heating, medical care, and loans for military personnel, martyrs' families, and other beneficiaries. Additionally, soldiers who have performed meritorious service receive rewards, including celebration banquets, honor plaques, and cash awards ranging from 300 to 500 yuan. Soldiers who have served beyond their term also receive appropriate material rewards.

    County Secretary Li Yongfeng and County Mayor Shi Lifang frequently visit the homes of military personnel and martyrs' families to inquire about their well-being and help solve their practical problems. Due to the attention from the county committee and government, the majority of villages in the county have established service groups for beneficiaries, providing assistance in production and daily life. In Shangjiali Township, the community mobilized people to write letters to soldiers on the front lines, and all schools in the township waived tuition fees for the children of martyrs and military personnel.

    The concern shown by various levels of leadership and the people of Luan County for their children in the military and their families has greatly boosted the sense of honor and responsibility among these soldiers. Last year, 8 soldiers from Luan County were awarded first-class merit citations, 13 were awarded second-class merit citations, and 105 were awarded third-class merit citations.

　　滦县拥军优抚形成制度
    本报讯  河北省滦县县委、县政府切实抓紧拥军优抚工作，少搞慰问宴请，多办实事，使这项工作由“季节性”、“突击性”向“经常性”、“制度化”转变，收到了明显的效果。
    滦县县委、县政府根据农村出现的新情况，于１９８７年底制定了有关具体措施，为军、烈属和优抚对象解决批房基地、烤火煤、看病、贷款等方面的困难。同时，对立功的现役军人实行奖励，除开庆功会、送光荣匾外，还分别发给３００元至５００元的奖金。对超期服役的军人，也给予适当的物质奖励。
    县委书记李永丰、县长史立芳经常深入军、烈属家里问寒问暖，为他们解决实际困难。由于县委、县政府的重视，全县绝大多数村都成立了优抚服务小组，为优抚对象提供生产、生活等方面的服务。商家林乡发动群众给前线军人写慰问信，全乡各学校为烈军属子女减免了学费。
    滦县各级领导机关及全县人民关心子弟兵及其家属，大大激发了子弟兵的荣誉感和责任感。去年，滦县籍的现役军人有８人荣立一等功，１３人荣立二等功，１０５人荣立三等功。
