Engels said: “With each epoch-making discovery in the realm of natural science, materialism must also necessarily change its form” (Selected Works of Marx and Engels, Vol. 4, p. 224). Now, the objective process of world history and the development of our country's reform practice have brought the historical task of developing and upholding Marxism to our agenda.

Everyone knows that the Marxist theoretical work of our new era began with a discussion on the criterion of truth, which had a philosophical enlightenment character. Because we restored and carried forward the Marxist line of thought, our Party, in leading the people of the whole country to build socialism with Chinese characteristics, has creatively applied and developed Marxism in many fields and aspects in the practice of construction. This is recognized worldwide. However, from an overall perspective, the Marxism we rely on as a theoretical guide still retains its original classical form. In the minds of many, only this classical form of Marxism is truly “orthodox” Marxism. Under such circumstances, people, out of habits formed over many years, insist on fitting various new categories, viewpoints, and schemes proposed in the reform process into the original theoretical framework of Marxism to understand and evaluate them. Once they find some inconsistencies between the two, they feel uncomfortable, and even feel that it goes against Marxism. This is a factor that has a negative impact on our reform cause.

It is clear that to overcome this negative impact, the key lies in adopting a scientific attitude towards Marxist classical theory. Reform itself is a revolution. Many new situations and problems we encounter in the reform process are things that the classical writers of Marxism have never seen or heard of. Therefore, we cannot expect to find ready-made conclusions and answers to these new situations and problems directly from their works, but we should dare to acknowledge and face the fact that some major issues we face today, such as the position, role, and development laws of commodity economy in a socialist society, are almost impossible to find answers to within the scope of Marxist classical theory.

Therefore, solving the problem of Marxist classical theory being inconsistent with people's social practice in some fields and aspects is not an easy task. However, I believe that examining and revealing whether the theme of Marxist classical theory is consistent with the theme of the current era and the theme of China's primary stage of socialism, so that we can grasp the relationship between Marxist classical theory and the present era and contemporary Chinese reality from a macro perspective, has great significance.

So, what is the theme of Marxist classical theory?

Engels once pointed out that historical materialism itself is a series of new historical facts, namely, the surge in the workers' movement in the 1830s and 1840s, the rise of the class struggle between the proletariat and the bourgeoisie to a major position in the history of the most developed countries in Europe, “forced people to conduct a new study of all past history” (Selected Works of Marx and Engels, Vol. 3, pp. 422-423). While Marx's economic theory, with the theory of surplus value as its foundation, conducted a comprehensive and in-depth study of the “historical and economic processes” on which the proletariat and bourgeoisie and their struggles are based, thus revealing the secrets of capitalist production and the laws of the inevitable demise of capitalism and the inevitable victory of socialism. Scientific socialism, as the theoretical expression of the proletarian movement, correctly pointed out the historical mission of the proletariat and the way to free themselves from capitalist slavery—overthrowing the political rule of the bourgeoisie and the capitalist system, establishing proletarian dictatorship and the socialist system. In short, it is to carry out the proletarian revolution. From this, it can be seen that although Marxist classical theory has extremely rich and varied scientific significance and social and cultural significance, its fundamental starting point, purpose, and central theme undoubtedly lie in proving the necessity and rationality of the proletarian revolution. The theme of the proletarian revolution, like a red line, runs through the entire system of Marxist classical theory, organically linking its three inherent components together.

The revolutionary theme inherent in Marxist classical theory was repeatedly strengthened and became more prominent and prominent in its main successors—Lenin, Stalin, and Mao Zedong. Lenin believed that class struggle and proletarian dictatorship are the core and essence of Marxism. Therefore, he said that only those who acknowledge class struggle and proletarian dictatorship are true Marxists. Such a conscious and exceptionally strong awareness of the revolutionary theme inherent in Marxist classical theory is vividly reflected in his famous theories on the party and the state, forming Lenin's unique “fighting materialism” style of language. Stalin inherited the tradition opened by Lenin. Even in the field of philosophy, far removed from the economic base and real life, he never forgot the theme of the proletarian revolution. For example, in the part of The Short Course on the History of the CPSU (B) where he discusses dialectical materialism and historical materialism, he can directly derive various conclusions about class struggle and proletarian revolution from some of the most basic principles of Marxist philosophy. Mao Zedong even said that the essence of Marxism is “rebellion is justified.” In fact, what he meant by rebellion was mainly the proletarian revolution.

It is worth noting that the vast majority of the older generation of proletarian revolutionaries accepted Marxism in this sense. They studied Marxist theory mainly to learn the principles and methods of revolution from it. They also passed on and instilled into the rising revolutionaries and socialist builders the principles and methods they had learned from Marx and Lenin's books and proven correct by past practice through every possible means. Thus, this Marxism, which takes the proletarian revolution as its theme and repeatedly strengthens this theme, has taken shape in various socialist countries. What is usually called traditional Marxism is essentially this. It not only exists in the form of theory in Marxist classical works and a large number of documents interpreting them, but also exists vividly in the social practice guided by it.

Marxist theory can only develop and be upheld in practical struggle. In the historical period from the impending proletarian revolution to its direct implementation, and then to the consolidation of revolutionary achievements, strengthening the revolutionary theme inherent in Marxist classical theory is not only blameless but also has objective necessity and rationality. However, after the proletarian revolution has achieved victory and been consolidated, especially after the socialist transformation of the ownership of the means of production has been completed, if the original revolutionary theme of Marxism is not timely changed, but rather continues to be adhered to and strengthened, this will cause Marxist theory to fundamentally depart from reality, from the present era and the reality of China's primary stage of socialism. This not only is the crux of Marxist theory being in a state of slow progress or even stagnation for a long time, but also constitutes a kind of inertial spiritual force that greatly obstructs our current reform practice.

Historical experience shows that the “leftist” errors characterized by the expansion of class struggle are always closely linked to the dogmatic treatment of Marxist classical works and the fragmentary words of Marxist classical writers. In contrast, our Party's Third Plenary Session of the Eleventh Central Committee, on the one hand, criticized this dogmatic tendency and rectified the Party's ideological line; on the other hand, it decisively stopped using the political slogan of “taking class struggle as the key link” and decided to shift the focus of the Party's work to socialist modernization construction. This indeed hit the nail on the head. This decision of great historical significance is completely in line with the trend of historical development in the present era and the theme of the present era—peace and development.

In the past few decades, especially after World War II, the productive forces of Western capitalist countries have made great strides, thus showing that capitalist production relations have room for the development of productive forces. As for the numerous developing countries, including most socialist countries, they are faced with the urgent task of developing national economies and rapidly changing their backward and poor conditions. Therefore, from a global perspective, the situation for the proletarian revolution does not exist at present and even in the foreseeable future for a fairly long historical period. Moreover, today it seems that the social transformation model of proletarian revolution, that is, overthrowing the rule of the bourgeoisie by force to establish a socialist system, is not necessarily a universal law. We cannot rule out the possibility that developed capitalist countries may choose and open up different roads to socialism in the future. Because the inconsistency between Marxist classical theory and the present era and contemporary Chinese reality is caused by its inherent theme no longer adapting to the development of the times, therefore, to develop Marxism under new historical conditions, we must first make a fundamental change in the theme that runs through the entire Marxist theoretical system. It is not difficult to see that trying to find arguments for new categories, viewpoints, or schemes aimed at adapting to new situations and solving new problems within the scope of Marxist classical theory is only a forced effort; attempting to solve the problem of theory departing from practice through adjusting or updating individual chapters or parts of Marxist classical theory may not be able to fundamentally solve the problem. Therefore, realizing a change in the theme cannot merely stop at supplementing, revising, or updating some individual conclusions or viewpoints of the original Marxism, but must necessarily present Marxist theory in a completely new form or shape while maintaining some basic principles (such as historical materialism, etc.). Because, in a sense, the change in the theme and the change in the form are unified.

If we say that there are still some shortcomings in China's Marxist theoretical work in the past decade, this is mainly reflected in: the change in the theme is limited to some fields (such as economics) and some aspects (such as socialist political economy) of Marxism, and has not been carried out and innovated throughout the entire Marxist theoretical system. This will inevitably affect the internal coordination and logical consistency of Marxist theory itself, and thus cannot help but weaken or even reduce its persuasiveness and guiding role in practice. However, to realize the change in the theme throughout the Marxist theoretical system is undoubtedly a very arduous task that requires long-term exploration and effort to complete. I believe that at least we can start from the following aspects to carry out this work:

First, adopt a scientific attitude towards Marxist classical theory, conduct serious exploration based on new situations and problems at home and abroad, realize the change in the theme, and make it adapt to the present era and contemporary Chinese reality.

Second, do not understand some basic concepts and basic principles of Marxism in a dogmatic way, but should give them new content based on the development of contemporary new science and technology and actual conditions. This refers to: due to the change in the theme of the times, some basic concepts or basic principles (such as the concept of value and the theory of class struggle) may need to be restated; some basic concepts, basic principles, or one of their aspects may have lost their original importance, and some new basic concepts and basic principles that have been discovered need to be introduced. On this issue, we must break away from the view that the “axiomatic system” composed of several basic principles and their combinations in the Marxist theoretical system is eternal and unchangeable, and never allows the slightest addition or subtraction.

Third, change the original structure of the Marxist theoretical system and quickly change the current situation where classical theory is still used as the main content of Marxism in propaganda, education, and even theoretical research. I believe that some parts of classical theory, such as the political economy of early capitalism and those contents in philosophy related to the critique of religious theology, may only have historical significance; while the political economy of developed capitalism and the theory of the primary stage of socialism, as well as philosophy on modern scientific cognition and reflection on modern human spiritual phenomena, should become the main part of Marxism after the theme has changed.

Fourth, adjust and change the traditional Marxist values and value standards. Traditional Marxism is characterized by strengthening the theme of the proletarian revolution. Therefore, whether in philosophy, political economy, scientific socialism, or other cultural fields, it first takes whether it is beneficial to the revolution and the revolutionary class as the standard for judging everything right and wrong, good and evil, and beautiful and ugly. While today, especially in countries building socialism, Marxism should take the survival of mankind and the all-round development of man, and whether it is beneficial to the harmonious development of the whole society and mankind as the highest value standard. This value concept and value standard are originally consistent with the communist ideological system. However, under the historical conditions where the proletarian revolution became the theme of Marxism, it was not allowed to highlight and emphasize this value concept and value standard and put it into practice. Today, it is urgent for Marxism to advocate and practice this value concept and value standard. Realizing this adjustment and change in value concepts and value standards is not only to meet the needs of socialist spiritual civilization construction, but also directly affects and determines the guiding role of Marxist theory on the contemporary working-class party and the social practice it leads.

Fifth, to develop and uphold Marxist theory, we should allow and encourage a hundred schools of thought to contend. Because the change in the theme, the renewal of theoretical content, and the change in value concepts and value standards are essentially a creative process. People can only start from different angles and use different methods to further enrich and develop Marxism on the basis of changing the theme of Marxism.

　　实现主题转变　发展马克思主义
    恩格斯说：“随着自然科学领域中每一个划时代的发现，唯物主义也必然要改变自己的形式”（《马克思恩格斯选集》第４卷第２２４页）。现在，世界历史的客观进程和当前我国改革实践的发展，已经把发展和坚持马克思主义的历史任务，提到我们的日程上来。
    大家知道，我国新时期的马克思主义理论工作，是从带有哲学启蒙性质的关于真理标准的讨论开始的。由于恢复并发扬了马克思主义的思想路线，我们党在领导全国人民建设有中国特色的社会主义的实践过程中，在许多领域和许多方面，都创造性地运用和发展了马克思主义。这一点是举世公认的。不过，从总体上说，我们依以作为理论指南的马克思主义，目前仍然保留着它原有的经典形态。在不少人的心目中，只有这种经典形态的马克思主义，才是真正“正统”的马克思主义。在这种情况下，人们出于多年来形成的习惯，硬是要把在改革过程中提出的各种新范畴、新观点和新方案等等，纳入马克思主义原有的理论框架来加以理解和衡量。一旦发现两者之间存在着某种不尽一致的地方，便觉得有些不好接受，甚至觉得有违背马克思主义之嫌。这是一种对我们的改革事业起消极影响的因素。
    很明显，要克服这种消极影响，关键在于要对马克思主义经典理论采取一种科学的态度。改革本身就是一场革命。我们在改革过程中所遇到的许多新情况和新问题，乃是马克思主义的经典作家们见所未见和闻所未闻的。因此，我们不能指望从他们的著作中找到直接适应这些新情况的现成结论和解决这些新问题的现成答案，而应当勇于承认和敢于面对这样的事实：我们今天所面临的某些带有重大原则的问题，如商品经济在社会主义社会中的地位、作用和发展规律的问题，在马克思主义经典理论的范围内，几乎是不可能找到答案的。
    因此，要解决马克思主义经典理论在某些领域、某些方面与当前人们的社会实践不相适应的问题，并不是一件轻而易举的事。但是我认为，考察并揭示马克思主义经典理论的主题是否与当前时代的主题相一致，是否与我国社会主义初级阶段的主题相一致，以便我们宏观地把握马克思主义经典理论与现时代及当代中国现实之间的关系，却有着十分重要的意义。
    那么，马克思主义经典理论的主题又是什么呢？
    恩格斯曾经指出，唯物史观本身就是这样一些新的历史事实，即１９世纪３０和４０年代工人运动高涨，无产阶级和资产阶级的阶级斗争在欧洲最发达国家的历史中上升到主要地位，“迫使人们对以往的全部历史作一番新的研究”所得的结果（《马克思恩格斯选集》第３卷第４２２—４２３页）。而马克思以剩余价值学说为基石的经济理论，则全面深入地研究了无产阶级和资产阶级及其斗争赖以产生的“历史的经济的过程”，从而揭露了资本主义生产的秘密，揭示了资本主义必然灭亡和社会主义必然胜利的规律。科学社会主义作为无产阶级运动的理论表现，正是在唯物史观和马克思经济理论的基础上，才正确地指出了无产阶级的历史使命和摆脱资本主义奴役的出路——推翻资产阶级的政治统治和资本主义制度，建立无产阶级专政和社会主义制度。一句话，即进行无产阶级革命。由此看来，尽管马克思主义经典理论有着极为丰富多采的科学意义和社会文化的意义，但其根本的出发点、宗旨和中心论题，却无疑在为无产阶级革命的必然性和合理性作论证。无产阶级革命的主题就像一条红线，贯穿整个马克思主义经典理论体系，把它所固有的三个组成部分有机地联系在一起。
    马克思主义经典理论固有的革命主题，在其主要后继者——列宁、斯大林和毛泽东的理论中被一再加以强化，变得更为鲜明和更为突出了。列宁认为，阶级斗争和无产阶级专政是马克思主义的核心和实质。因此他说，只有承认阶级斗争，同时也承认无产阶级专政的人，才是真正的马克思主义者。对马克思主义经典理论固有革命主题的这种自觉而又异常强烈的意识，极为鲜明地体现在他关于党和国家的著名学说中，以至形成了列宁所特有的“战斗唯物主义”的语言风格。斯大林继承了列宁所开创的这种传统，他即使在远离经济基础和现实生活的哲学领域，也从不忘记无产阶级革命的主题。例如，他在《联共（布）党史简明教程》论述辩证唯物主义和历史唯物主义的部分中，从马克思主义哲学某些最基本的原理出发，也能够直接推导出关于阶级斗争和无产阶级革命的种种结论来。毛泽东甚至说，马克思主义的道理千头万绪，归根结底一句话，就是“造反有理”。其实他所谓造反，主要就是指无产阶级革命。
    值得注意的是，老一代无产阶级革命家中的绝大多数，都是在这样的意义上接受马克思主义的。他们学习马克思主义理论，主要就是从中学习革命的道理和方法。他们还通过一切可能的途径，把自己从马列的书本中所学到、并被以往的实践证明为正确的这些道理和方法，传授、灌输给后起的革命者和社会主义建设者。于是，这种以无产阶级革命为主题，并把这一主题一再加以强化的马克思主义，使它在各社会主义国家中形成为传统。通常所谓传统的马克思主义，其实质就是如此。它不仅以理论的形态存在于马克思主义经典著作和对其进行诠释的大量文献中，而且还活生生地存在于以此作为指南的社会实践过程中。
    马克思主义理论要在实践斗争中才能发展和坚持。在无产阶级革命从日趋迫近到直接付诸实践，再到巩固革命胜利成果的历史时期内，强化马克思主义经典理论固有的革命主题，不但无可非议，而且有其客观的必然性和合理性。但是，在无产阶级革命取得胜利并得到巩固，特别是在完成生产资料所有制的社会主义改造之后，如果不及时地转换马克思主义原有的革命主题，反而继续固守并一再强化这一主题，这就会使马克思主义理论从根本上脱离实际，脱离现时代及我国社会主义初级阶段的实际。这不仅是导致马克思主义理论长期处于进展迟缓甚至停步不前状态的症结所在，而且也构成了对当前我国的改革实践起巨大阻碍作用的一种惰性的精神力量。
    历史的经验表明，以阶级斗争扩大化为主要特征的“左”的错误，总是与教条式地对待马克思主义经典著作和马克思主义经典作家们的片言只语紧密联系在一起的。与此适成对照，我们党的十一届三中全会，一方面批判了这种教条主义的倾向，端正了党的思想路线；另一方面又果断地停止使用“以阶级斗争为纲”的政治口号，并决定把全党的工作重心转移到社会主义现代化建设上来。这的确是抓住了问题的要害。这一具有历史意义的重大决策，与现时代历史发展的趋势和当前时代的主题——和平与发展也是完全一致的。
    最近几十年，特别是在二次大战以后，西方资本主义国家的社会生产力取得了很大的发展，从而表明资本主义生产关系为生产力的发展留有余地。至于为数众多的发展中国家，其中也包括大多数社会主义国家面临着发展民族经济，迅速改变贫穷落后状况的迫切任务。因此，从世界范围来看，无产阶级革命的形势在目前甚至在可以预见的今后一个相当长的历史时期内是不存在的。而且，今天看来，关于无产阶级革命，即用暴力推翻资产阶级的统治来建立社会主义制度的社会变革模式，也未必是一个普遍的规律。我们不能事先排除发达资本主义国家在未来走向社会主义道路的过程中，有可能选择和开辟与此不同的道路。正因为马克思主义经典理论与现时代及当代中国现实之间的不适应，是由其固有主题已不适应时代的发展所造成的，因此，要在新的历史条件下发展马克思主义，首先必须使贯穿整个马克思主义理论体系的主题来一个根本的转变。不难看出，要想在马克思主义经典理论的范围内，为那些旨在适应新情况和解决新问题而提出的新范畴、新观点或新方案寻找论据，只是勉为其难；试图通过调整或更新马克思主义经典理论的个别篇章或个别部分，恐怕亦未必能从根本上解决理论脱离实践的问题。因此，实现主题的转变，绝不可能仅仅停留在对马克思主义原有的某些个别结论或个别观点的补充、修正或更新上，而必然是马克思主义理论体系在保持某些基本原理（如唯物史观等等）的前提下，以一种全新的面貌或形态出现。因为从一定意义上说，主题的转变和形态的变革是统一的。
    如果说，近十年来我国的马克思主义理论工作还存在着某些不足的话，这首先就表现在：主题的转变仅限于马克思主义的某些领域（如经济）和某些方面（如社会主义政治经济学），还没有贯彻于整个马克思主义的理论体系而加以发展和创新。这就势必会影响马克思主义理论自身的内在协调性和逻辑一贯性，也就不能不影响甚至削弱它的说服力和对实践的指导作用。然而要使马克思主义理论体系从总体上实现主题的转变，无疑是一项十分艰巨的任务，需要经过长期的探索和努力才能完成。我认为，目前我们至少可以从以下几个方面着手进行这项工作：
    第一，以科学的态度对待马克思主义经典理论，根据国际和国内的新状况、新问题进行认真的探索，实现主题的转变，使之与现时代及当代中国的现实相适应。
    第二，对马克思主义的某些基本概念和基本原理不能教条式地去理解，而应依据当代新的科学技术的发展和实际状况而赋予新的内容。这是指：由于时代主题的变化，某些基本概念或基本原理（如价值概念和阶级斗争学说）可能需要加以重述；某些基本概念、基本原理或其某一个侧面可能已失去了它们原先所具有的重要性，引入某些新发现的基本概念和基本原理。在这个问题上，必须破除这样一种观点，即认为在马克思主义理论体系中，由若干基本原理及其组合所构成的“公理系统”是万古不变的，永远不允许有丝毫的损益。
    第三，变革马克思主义理论体系的原有结构，迅速改变目前在宣传、教育乃至理论研究中，仍以经典理论作为马克思主义之主体内容的状况。我认为，经典理论中的某些部分，如关于早期资本主义的政治经济学、哲学中与批判宗教神学世界观有关的那些内容等等，可能只具有历史的意义；而关于发达资本主义的政治经济学和关于社会主义初级阶段的理论，以及哲学中关于现代科学认识和关于现代人类精神现象的反思等等，则理应成为转变了主题之后的马克思主义的主体部分。
    第四，调整和变革传统马克思主义的价值观念和价值标准。传统的马克思主义是以强化无产阶级革命的主题为基本特征的。因此，不论是在哲学、政治经济学或科学社会主义乃至其它各种文化领域中，首先它是以是否有利于革命和革命阶级为衡量和判断一切是非、善恶和美丑的标准。而在今天，特别是在进行社会主义建设的国家中，马克思主义应当把人类的生存和人的全面发展，把是否有利于全社会与全人类和谐一致的发展作为最高的价值标准。这种价值观念和价值标准本来是与共产主义的思想体系一致的。但是，在无产阶级革命成为马克思主义的主题的历史条件下，却不允许突出和强调这种价值观念和价值标准并把它付诸实践。今天，弘扬并实践这种价值观念和价值标准，对于马克思主义来说已是刻不容缓的了。实现价值观念和价值标准的这种调整和变革，不仅是适应社会主义精神文明建设的需要，而且还直接影响和规定着马克思主义理论对于当代工人阶级政党及其所领导的社会实践的定向作用。
    第五，为了发展和坚持马克思主义理论，应该允许并鼓励百家争鸣。因为主题的转变、理论内容上的更新以及价值观念和价值标准的变革，实际上是一个创造性的过程。人们只有从不同的角度出发，运用不同的方法，才可能在转变马克思主义主题的基础上，进一步丰富和发展马克思主义。
