Young Pioneers Love the Spring City and Cherish the Spring Water; Mayor of Jinan Expresses Gratitude and Support

	Our reporter, Jia Jianzhou, reports: Recently, the Young Pioneers of Jinan City, Shandong Province, wrote a letter to Mayor Zhai Yongmian, proposing to launch an activity this year among all Young Pioneers called "Love the Spring City," "Protect the Spring Water," and "Strive to Be Little Guards of the Spring Water." Mayor Zhai immediately replied with a letter of thanks, expressing strong support for this initiative.

	The ancient and beautiful city of Jinan is famous worldwide for its seventy-two springs. However, in recent years, due to factors such as prolonged drought and lack of rain, the groundwater level has rapidly decreased. The Baotu Spring no longer gushes, and many spring eyes have dried up and become barren, causing tourists who come to see the springs to leave disappointed.

	In response to the water shortage gradually threatening the Spring City, Mayor Zhai Yongmian called on the citizens: Loving the Spring City means loving the spring water, and loving the spring water requires first saving water. The Young Pioneers wrote to the mayor, proposing to launch the "Little Guards of the Spring Water" activity among the children. They will establish a "Spring Water Protection Team," go out into society, visit factories, shops, streets, and schools, and propagate the significance of water conservation and the requirements for saving water to the people of the entire city. They will persuade people to stop wasting water; hang "Honorable Water-Saving Plaques" for units and households that save water; and award flowers of honor to factory directors and managers who save water. At the same time, they will start from themselves, actively carry out "Family Water-Saving Competitions," and strive to be the "Little Vanguards" and "Little Heroes" of water conservation and spring protection with practical actions.

	In his reply letter, Mayor Zhai said: "It is very commendable that you, at such a young age, care about the affairs of the entire city."

　　少先队员爱泉城更爱泉水
    济南市长表谢意更表支持
    本报讯  记者贾建舟报道：最近，山东省济南市少先队员给市长翟永浡写信，打算今年在全体少先队员中开展“爱泉城”“护泉水”、“争当泉水小卫士”活动。翟市长立即复信致谢，热情支持这一举动。
    古老美丽的济南，以七十二泉名扬天下。然而，近几年，受久旱少雨等多种因素影响，地下水位急骤下降，趵突泉不再喷涌，许多泉眼干裂枯竭，致使慕名观泉的游客扫兴而归。
    针对水荒逐渐危及泉城的情况，市长翟永浡向市民提出：爱泉城必须爱泉水，爱泉水必先节约水。少先队员向市长写信，在小朋友中开展“泉水小卫士”活动。他们将成立“泉水护卫团”，走上社会，到工厂、商店、街道、学校，向全市人民宣传护水意义和节水的要求，劝阻浪费水的现象；为节水好的单位和住户悬挂“节水光荣牌”；为节水好的厂长、经理挂光荣花。同时，从自身做起，积极开展“家庭节水竞赛”，以实际行动争做节水护泉的“小先锋”、“小功臣”。
    翟市长在复信中说：“小小的年纪就关心全市人民的事情，这是十分可贺的。”
