	The Position of Agriculture
	Yu Qing
	While visiting the Shandong Peninsula, my hospitable hosts insisted that I visit some townships.

	In a township on the outskirts of Laizhou City, grand factory buildings rose from the ground, and the hum of machinery made it hard to tell if this was a city or the countryside. However, a local resident said, "You can tell the difference at night."

	Night fell. The lights of the township enterprises shone like stars in the sky, while the farmers' houses were pitch black.

	It turned out that not only were the farmers' homes dark at night with no television, but even the power for irrigation was often cut off by industrial demands. It's not that no electricity was given at all, but the trickle of power usually only reached the fields late at night, sporadically. A local amateur cartoonist showed me a self-mocking sketch. In it, he is seen under a crescent moon, wrapped in a quilt, guarding a water pump, muttering, "When will the power come?"

	From this small scene, one can see that in some places, agriculture has been pushed to the corners.

	Where should agriculture be positioned?

	"Agriculture is the foundation of the national economy." If agriculture is not valued, people will go hungry. This truth doesn't need much thought to understand.

	However, to truly recognize the importance of agriculture, it is better to use one's head to delve deeply rather than relying on one's stomach to feel. Currently, to improve the economic environment and curb the high inflation rate, a solid agricultural foundation is first needed. If agricultural products are scarce, the prices of food and clothing will be unstable, and the entire society's cost of labor will rise. As labor costs increase, all commodities will inevitably follow suit. I once chatted with a worker who complained about the high prices while also being dissatisfied with the low prices of his factory's products. He said, "If prices aren't adjusted, our factory's bonuses won't be paid. Just relying on the basic wage, food will definitely not be as good as before." In fact, this grievance indirectly reflects the mutual causality of agricultural and industrial product prices in the inflation chain.

	"People rely on food for survival." "Without tilling and reaping, how can one eat?" China's arable land accounts for only 7% of the world's total, yet it has to feed nearly 1/4 of the world's population. The approach of focusing only on developing industry and making money, without worrying about filling one's stomach, is, in the extreme, akin to "trying to reach the sky by pulling one's hair."

　　“农”的位置
    雨晴
    去胶东采访，好客的主人硬要我去乡镇转转。
    在莱州市郊的一个乡，一幢幢气派的厂房拔地而起，机器轰鸣，令人难以分清这里到底是城市还是乡野。可当地人士说：“分得清。天一黑就知道了。”
    夜来了。乡镇企业的灯火如天际之群星，而农民的屋舍却漆黑一片。
    原来，不单农户入夜灯黑，电视无影，就是水浇地的电源也常被工业拉断。说一点电不给也有些冤枉，只是那油珠似的电流通常夜半三更才断断续续流到田头。有位乡村业余漫画家拿出一幅“自嘲像”，只见他顶着月牙，裹着棉被，守在水泵旁，喃喃自语：“啥时给电？”
    从这个小镜头，可以看到一些地方农业被挤到了犄角旮旯。
    农业的位置应在何处？
    “农业是国民经济的基础。”不重视农业，就饿肚子，这个道理用不着想也可以感觉到。
    不过，要真正认识农业的重要性，用肚子去感受，毕竟不如用头脑去深究。当前，治理经济环境，遏制过高的通货膨胀率，首先需要农业基础坚实。假如农产品紧张，吃的、穿的就会价格不稳，全社会支付劳动力的费用就会上升。劳动成本提高了，所有商品也必然跟着涨价。笔者曾与一位工人闲聊，他一边抱怨物价太贵，一边不满本厂的产品价低。他说：“再不调价，我们厂的奖金就发不出了。光靠基本工资，吃的肯定不如过去好。”其实这牢骚就曲折地反映了通货膨胀链条中工农产品价格互为因果的关系。
    “民以食为天”。“不稼不穑，胡为餐兮”。我国耕地只占全球７％，却要养活世界近１／４的人口。那种只顾多办工业，多赚钱，而不怕亏了肚皮的做法，极而喻之，颇似“拔着头发想上天”。
