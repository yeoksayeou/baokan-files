The Chinese ice hockey team, competing under the name Harbin Star Light Team, played to a 3-3 draw against the Soviet Union's Khabarovsk team in the Star Light Group Cup International Ice Hockey Invitational Tournament held tonight at the ice training base in Harbin.

The Khabarovsk team finished 20th in last year's Soviet B-level championship. Tonight, 6 minutes and 45 seconds into the first period, guest player No. 15, Alexin, scored during a scramble in front of the opposing goal. Six minutes later, the home team's forward Wang Anfu, in a small combination with teammate Liu Wenwu, pushed the ball into the net to tie the score. With the support of more than 4,000 cheering spectators, the home team eventually forced a draw with the opposing team. So far, the Soviet Union team has one win and one draw; the Harbin Star Light Team has two draws in two matches; and the Boston Club team from the United States has one draw and one loss.
