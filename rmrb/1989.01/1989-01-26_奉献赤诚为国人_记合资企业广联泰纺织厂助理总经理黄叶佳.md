Dedication to the People
— A Record of Huang Yejia, Deputy General Manager of the Joint Venture Guangliantai Textile Mill

By Lin Li, Reporter for the People's Daily

Huang Yejia's vacation in Hong Kong has ended. He is returning to a factory in Taiwan to continue his work. Before his departure, he casually flipped through and read the day's newspaper. An advertisement for a job caught his eye:

Enping County Guangliantai Textile Mill is recruiting a factory director.

After reading the entire advertisement, he realized this was a joint venture between Hong Kong and Enping in mainland China. What made him unable to calm down was that the requirements for the factory director were not only his specialty but also his forte. He put down the newspaper, thought for a moment, and immediately wrote an application letter.

	One Strike and Success

Huang Yejia, 43 years old, a Hong Kong resident with ancestral roots in Dongguan, has a typical intellectual demeanor and a strong sense of career ambition. He studied textile engineering at the Hong Kong Polytechnic and is a seasoned professional in the textile industry. He wanted to achieve something significant but felt it was difficult to do so. At that time, a textile factory in Taiwan was recruiting management talent in Hong Kong. Huang Yejia succeeded on his first try and went to Taiwan. He worked first at Dali, then at Huayue Textile Mill as a factory director and manager, and found it quite comfortable and enjoyable. However, he always felt something was missing. What was missing? He pondered and finally concluded it with six words: a sense of belonging, a sense of security. Working with the boss, if suddenly he no longer needed you, you would be at a loss. Moreover, he had managed enterprises for 20 years and had carefully studied American and Japanese enterprise management. However, these were all Western, belonging to the capitalist world. What about Eastern, socialist enterprise management? He did not understand. The recruitment advertisement from Enping Guangliantai provided him with an opportunity to make up for his deficiencies.

On the fourth day of Huang Yejia's return to the Huayue Textile Mill in Taiwan, he received a message that Guangliantai welcomed him to apply for the position promptly.

Huang Yejia succeeded again.

The board of directors of Guangliantai appointed Huang Yejia as the deputy general manager and authorized him to act as both the general manager and the deputy general manager. He announced that he was recruited by the board of directors and could only represent the board of directors to exercise his powers and seek the maximum economic benefits. He would not do anything detrimental to any party.

His words shocked everyone.

The people of Enping and the employees of Guangliantai regarded him as "one of their own," and he also gained the understanding of the Hong Kong investors: "Yes! The deputy general manager was recruited by both sides, so it is natural that he represents both sides!"

	People Stop, Machines Don't

The Guangliantai Textile Mill introduced complete sets of machinery and equipment from West Germany and Switzerland, with a high level of modernization. However, these machines did not perform to their full potential. Huang Yejia saw at a glance that advanced equipment without advanced management was not a good match. Take the shift changes, for example! They used the "four shifts, three operations" system from the 1950s. That is, four shifts rotate, and the shift changes once a week. Every time a shift change occurs, the machines stop for two shifts, 16 hours. This shift system caused the spinning workshop, which should have 21 shifts per week, to only operate 19 shifts. Two shifts, 16 hours, were wasted. The spinning workshop, which should operate 24 hours a day in three shifts, actually stops for 5 hours a day due to shift changes, lunch breaks, and meal breaks, totaling 35 hours a week. Adding the 16 hours lost due to shift changes, the total is 51 hours, meaning that in 7 days, they could not even complete 5 days of production. Waste of working hours is a big taboo in modern production. Huang Yejia decided on the spot to change from "four shifts, three operations" to "three shifts, three operations," eliminating the stoppages for shift changes, lunch breaks, and meal breaks, implementing the principle of "people stop, machines don't." At the same time, he implemented a rotating rest system where everyone can take a day off within a week. This way, the labor quota for the spinning workshop exactly matched the requirements of the machinery, that is, 120 people for 10,000 spindles (domestically, it is 450-540 people for 10,000 spindles). It also laid the foundation for ensuring the quality of cotton yarn. Now, the cotton yarn from Enping Guangliantai is 100% first-grade product, a hot item in the international market, with a 10% higher export price than similar domestic products.

	Workers Welcome Him

Huang Yejia brought advanced management methods from overseas and also tried to leverage the positive factors of socialism. In the textile mills where he previously worked, there were no dormitories for workers. Huang Yejia visited mainland China and understood the positive significance of building worker dormitories in a situation where commercial housing was scarce. He also saw the actual difficulties faced by young workers in Enping who had no dormitories. Therefore, he wrote a report to the board of directors, requesting funds to build dormitories. At the same time, he proposed that the construction costs of the dormitories be jointly borne by the factory and individuals, with installment payments over 15 years, and the property belonging to the individuals. Considering that some units often find it more difficult to allocate housing than to build it, he formulated the "points-based housing allocation method." The basic idea is: do you want a house? Work hard, use your hard work to strive for an early and good house.

Huang Yejia also paid great attention to leading by example. Every day, he arrives at the factory at 7:30 AM and leaves at 7:30 PM, coming early and leaving late. During lunch, while the staff return home to rest and eat, Huang Yejia lives in Hong Kong and is single. He stays in the factory, hurriedly eats something, and then goes to the workshop to check the operation of the machines and understand the production and living conditions of the workers. He said that in Taiwan and Hong Kong, there is a 1-hour lunch break, and after eating, there is no time to go to the workshop. In Enping, there is a 2-hour lunch break, staying in the office is boring, going to the workshop to look around and talk to the workers is meaningful.

Huang Yejia has been in Enping for three years, and Guangliantai has received unanimous praise from top to bottom, being awarded the honor of "Advanced Collective in the National Foreign Trade and Economic Cooperation Industry" by the Ministry of Foreign Trade and Economic Cooperation, and the title of "Advanced Technological Enterprise" by the Guangdong Provincial Foreign Trade and Economic Cooperation Commission. The Minister of the Textile Industry, Wu Wenying, wrote the calligraphy "New Flower in Textiles" for Guangliantai. Amidst the praise, Huang Yejia became even more diligent. In three years, he and several other deputy general managers completed the organizational production tasks while also organizing the completion of the second-phase construction project of Guangliantai. The spinning workshop of the Enping Textile Mill increased from 20,000 spindles to 32,000 spindles. At the same time, a weaving mill, dyeing mill, power plant, and sewage treatment and water purification plant were built. The construction of a garment factory with a planned investment of $1.3 billion and the third-phase project are being accelerated. Huang Yejia's wish is to continue to dedicate his sincerity to the people.

　　奉献赤诚为国人    
    ——记合资企业广联泰纺织厂助理总经理黄叶佳
    本报记者  林里
    黄叶佳在香港的假期结束了。他要回台湾一家工厂继续任职。起程前，他漫不经心地翻着、看着当天的报纸。一条招聘广告吸引了他：
    恩平县广联泰纺织厂招聘厂长。
    看完全文，他知道这是香港和内地的恩平共同举办的联合企业。使他久久不能平静的是，广告上所要求的厂长条件，不光是他的专业，而且是他的擅长。他放下报纸，沉思一番，立刻写了应聘书。
    　　　　一举中的
    黄叶佳，４３岁，香港人，祖籍东莞，典型的知识分子气质，具有强烈的事业心。当年，他就读于香港理工学院的纺织系，是纺织行业的里手。他想成就一番事业，但又感到施展不易。恰在这时，台湾一家纺织厂来香港招聘管理人才。黄叶佳一举中的，到了台湾。先在大来，后在华煜纺织厂当厂长，当经理，倒也自在，惬意。可是，他总感到缺少什么东西，缺少什么呢？他思索再三，归结为六个字：归宿感，安全感。与老板共事，一下子人家不要你了，手足无措。再说，他搞了２０年企业管理，也精心研究过美国的、日本的企业管理，然而，这些都是西方的，属于资本主义世界的。而东方，社会主义的企业管理又是什么呢？他不了解。恩平广联泰的招聘广告，正好给他提供了弥补不足的机遇。
    黄叶佳回到台湾华煜纺织厂的第四天，就接到信息说是广联泰欢迎他尽快应考。
    黄叶佳又是一举中的。
    广联泰董事会任命黄叶佳为助理总经理，又授权黄代行总经理和副总经理的双重职权。他宣布，他是董事会招聘来的，他只能代表董事会行使职权，谋取最大的经济效益。不做有损于任何一方的事。
    语惊四座。
    恩平和广大职工把他看成“自己人”，他也得到港方投资者的谅解：“对呀！助理总经理是双方招来的，理所当然是代表双方的呀！”
    　　　　人停车不停
    广联泰纺织厂成套引进西德、瑞士机械设备，现代化水平相当高。可是这些机械设备没有发挥出应有效能。黄叶佳一眼看出，先进的设备，没有先进的管理，不配套呀。就说上下班吧！用的是５０年代的“四班三运转”。也就是四班轮流，每周倒一次班。而每倒一次班，就停车两个班次、１６小时。这种轮班办法，使本来应当每周２１个班次的纺纱车间，却只能运转１９个班次。白白丢掉了两个班次，１６小时。纺纱车间，说的是日夜三班，本应当运转２４小时。然而，换班停车、午休停车、吃饭停车，一天中间停车占去５小时，一周就是３５个小时。加上倒班损失的１６个小时，一共是５１个小时，也就是说，７天以内的生产时间，连５天也干不满。工时浪费，是现代化生产的大忌。黄叶佳当机立断，改“四班三运转”为“三班三运转”，把换班、午休、吃饭的停车时间，全都改为“人停车不停”。同时，实行“人人能休假，７天当中总有一人休假”的轮休制。这一来，就使纺纱车间的劳动定员，恰好跟机械设备的要求相符。即：万支纱锭定员１２０人（万支纱锭定员国内是４５０—５４０人。）也为保证棉纱质量打下基础。现在，恩平广联泰的棉纱，一级品占１００％，成了国际市场的抢手货，比国内同样产品的外销价高１０％。
    　　　　工人欢迎他
    黄叶佳带来了海外先进的经营管理办法，也在尝试发挥社会主义的积极因素。他以前所在的纺织厂，都没有职工宿舍。黄叶佳到内地参观，知道在商品房匮乏的情况下，建职工宿舍的积极意义，也看到恩平青年工人没有宿舍的实际困难。于是他给董事会写报告，要求拨款建宿舍。但同时提出，宿舍建筑费由工厂和个人共同负担，分期付款，１５年还清，房产归个人。考虑到一些单位分房往往比建房还难，他制订了“积分分房法”。基本精神是，你要住房吗？好好劳动，用你的艰苦劳动，争取早住房，住好房。
    黄叶佳也很注意以身作则。每天，他早上７点３０分进厂，晚７点３０分离开，早来晚走。中午，职员们回家休息、吃饭，黄叶佳家在香港，是单身。留在工厂匆匆吃点什么以后，就下车间，察看机器运转情况，了解工人生产情况和生活情况。他说在台湾，在香港，中午休息１小时，吃饭以后没空到车间去。在恩平，中午休息２小时，呆在办公室怪无聊，到车间看看，同工人谈谈，很有意义。
    黄叶佳到恩平已满三年，广联泰得到上下一致的好评，被国家经贸部授予全国经贸行业先进集体的光荣称号，还获得了广东省经贸委给予的“先进技术型企业”的荣誉。纺织工业部长吴文英为广联泰写了“纺织新花”的大字。在一片赞扬声中，黄叶佳更加兢兢业业。三年当中，他和公司其他几位助理副总经理一起，在完成组织生产任务的同时，又组织完成了广联泰的第二期基建工程任务。使恩平纺织厂的纺纱车间，由２万纱锭增加到３．２万纱锭。还同时建成了织布厂、印染厂、火力发电厂和污水处理、清水净化厂，计划投资１．３亿美元的制衣厂工程和第三期工程，正在加紧进行。黄叶佳的心愿是：把赤诚继续奉献给国人。
