It is difficult to comment on historical figures, and even more challenging to write their biographies. Writing a biography that presents a fair and accurate portrayal of a figure is particularly difficult. Re-evaluating a figure with established views or conclusions and writing a comprehensive biography is even more arduous. Professor Xia Dongyuan, after meticulously gathering historical materials over nearly thirty years, has completed a 300,000-word "Biography of Sheng Xuanhuai," addressing this difficulty.

Sheng Xuanhuai (1844–1916) is a figure whose life almost spanned the entire period of modern Chinese history. For a long time, the image of Sheng Xuanhuai as a comprador-type official involved in the Self-Strengthening Movement has lingered in the minds of many modern historians. To change and reverse this perception, one must enrich the data, have scholarly courage, and conduct painstaking research before it is possible to establish new arguments. "Biography of Sheng Xuanhuai" has indeed embodied these three aspects.

The author has summarized a rule for his research on modern figures: "Evaluating figures and events in modern Chinese history requires not only examining their understanding, attitudes, and roles towards imperialism, feudalism, and the Chinese nation and people, but also towards capitalism." This summary can be simply stated as analyzing from both political and economic perspectives to draw conclusions. Starting from the affirmation of the progressive significance of the Self-Strengthening Movement, the author focuses on Sheng Xuanhuai's two main aspects of "accomplishing great deeds" and "holding high office," using the former to affirm and the latter to negate, with the former as the main theme. He affirms that Sheng Xuanhuai "took it upon himself to manage modern industry and commerce needed for the development of Chinese society and was highly effective," and was "an outstanding figure who followed the historical development trend" (Preface). He believes that Sheng Xuanhuai was a powerful manager of capitalist industry and commerce, and the enterprises he managed, such as shipping, telegraphy, mining, and textiles, were all "essential for the nation." These enterprises all had two major characteristics: adapting to the needs of the times and resisting the encroachment of foreign merchants. This naturally led to the conclusion that Sheng Xuanhuai shed the label of "big comprador" and became a historical figure opposing feudal economics and developing Chinese capitalism. In the great historical transformation period of semi-colonial and semi-feudal China, for one person to single-handedly clear the way and manage so many "essential enterprises for the nation," it is natural to conclude that Sheng Xuanhuai was an "extraordinary person in extraordinary times, doing extraordinary things." These three "extraordinary" aspects are the main threads that Xia Dongyuan grasped in writing the "Biography of Sheng Xuanhuai."

In the "Biography of Sheng Xuanhuai," Xia Dongyuan uses vivid language to change the traditional views of evaluating modern figures. He points out that using "greedy and money-grubbing" to criticize Sheng Xuanhuai is unfair, and believes that "making money" was actually Sheng Xuanhuai's progressive manifestation, because "the law of surplus value has been a powerful lever driving historical progress." The entire biography devotes considerable space to summarizing Sheng Xuanhuai's Self-Strengthening business ideas, believing that Sheng Xuanhuai "in his Self-Strengthening business warfare ideas, from the production process to the circulation process, has formed a relatively complete ideological system." The central characteristic of this "system" is "to compete with foreign merchants in economic development to achieve wealth and strength." Although the biography does not touch on real-world issues, this historical conclusion will strongly inspire readers to understand the importance of China's commodity economy and to re-evaluate the history of capitalism, especially Chinese capitalism. This is the important significance of the book's content.

Indeed, previous evaluations of Sheng Xuanhuai have been unfair. Figures like Zheng Guanying, Ma Jianzhong, and Xu Run, who were also involved in the Self-Strengthening Movement, were crowned with titles such as reformist thinkers and entrepreneurs, while Sheng Xuanhuai, who had business warfare ideas and had managed four major civilian enterprises—shipping, telegraphy, mining, and textiles—was labeled with the infamous title of "big comprador." Xia Dongyuan conducted comparative studies of the above figures and then made his judgments. When analyzing the conflict between Sheng Xuanhuai and Ma Jianzhong over the protection of telegraph rights, he used original archives as the main evidence to conclude that Ma Jianzhong's "sentiment for protecting telegraph rights was not as deep as Sheng Xuanhuai's," and Sheng Xuanhuai "consistently protected China's telegraph rights," so "in this regard, Ma Jianzhong was far behind Sheng Xuanhuai!" When commenting on the conflict between Sheng Xuanhuai and Xu Run over the control of the China Merchants' Steam Navigation Company, he proposed a new standard of right and wrong, that is, "the law of capitalist competition is to obtain as much profit as possible, to eliminate the opponent, and to let the big fish eat the small fish." Since both Sheng and Xu were capitalists, then "from the perspective of the capitalist competition law of the big fish eating the small fish, there is no room for criticism." As for Zheng Guanying's achievements, they were mainly due to Sheng Xuanhuai's promotion and support. Thus, how to position Sheng Xuanhuai is self-evident.

Xia Dongyuan's affirmation of Sheng Xuanhuai's economic achievements makes one feel somewhat emotional; but the historian's pen ultimately holds reason, and he also criticizes Sheng Xuanhuai's negative aspects. The author follows Sheng Xuanhuai's life path of using "accomplishing great deeds" as capital to gradually achieve the goal of "holding high office," commenting that Sheng Xuanhuai "was both a merchant and an official, transitioning from being an official to becoming one; using merchant power to seek official positions, and from leaning towards officialdom to using official power to suppress merchants." This is also a criticism of his other side of "holding high office." The author judges that "Sheng Xuanhuai's political attitudes and views on transforming autocracy into democracy were not only inferior to the reformists but also could not keep up with some Self-Strengthening officials." Even when determining the right and wrong between Sheng Xuanhuai and Xu Run and favoring Sheng, he points out that Sheng Xuanhuai's "use of official power to achieve his goals went beyond the scope of free competition" is wrong. The author reveals that during the Boxer Rebellion against imperialism, Sheng Xuanhuai "was particularly indignant and hostile towards the Boxers who directly harmed his Self-Strengthening enterprises and businesses," showing that "he always stood on the opposing side of the people's resistance." In handling Sino-foreign relations, he "strongly advocated listening to the opinions of foreigners." Sheng Xuanhuai, who was a victorious and greedy figure in economic development, was politically conservative and compromising, increasing his feudal and comprador characteristics. "Throughout his life, he could not overcome the contradiction between his conservative political stance and progressive economic practice," is the author's overall evaluation of Sheng Xuanhuai's life.

Of course, everything has its flaws. Although the "Biography of Sheng Xuanhuai" is a masterpiece, it is not without its shortcomings. The author, based on historical materials, objectively re-evaluates Sheng Xuanhuai, using the three "extraordinary" aspects as the main thread. The entire biography is reasonable and logical in discussing the extraordinary person doing extraordinary things; but the discussion of the "extraordinary times" in which these two "extraordinary" aspects are situated seems insufficient. If more ink were devoted to Sheng Xuanhuai's "extraordinary times," it would show a certain soil that nurtures and grows certain flowers and fruits, increasing credibility and blending the author's emotional pen, and the three extraordinary aspects would be more tightly connected. Reading the entire book, one feels a bit heavy-handed, especially the last three lines at the end of the biography, which make a "what if" assumption about Sheng Xuanhuai's political attitudes. This is the author's hope that Sheng Xuanhuai would become a more perfect figure. However, history does not accept assumptions. If these last three lines were deleted, the end of the biography would be more thought-provoking and inspiring. The author's mastery and use of historical materials are indeed profound, but if, in addition to archives, he could also expand to official books, private notes, miscellaneous writings, and contemporary insights, he would demonstrate even greater depth and broaden the reader's horizons. As for historical figures, they not only have their achievements in business, but also inevitably have family life, personal interests, and interpersonal relationships. The "Biography of Sheng Xuanhuai" focuses on the two major aspects of the subject's political and economic life, undoubtedly a rigorous "hardware." If it could also appropriately adorn some of the subject's life, interests, and relationships, etc., as "software," then a biography with fresh intentions, rich content, a combination of soft and hard, and a full-fledged figure would make academic insights cover readers more broadly.

　　“非常之世”的“非常之人”
    ——读夏东元著《盛宣怀传》
    来新夏
    评论历史人物难，为人物写传更难；写一部持论公允人物真貌的传记尤难；重新评论久有成说或定论的人物，并为之写出一部全传更是难上加难。夏东元教授在详细占有史料的基础上，耗近三十个寒暑，写成一部３０余万字的《盛宣怀传》正解决了这样一个难点。
    盛宣怀（１８４４—１９１６年）是与中国近代史几乎相终始的人物。长期以来，盛宣怀这个买办性洋务人员的形象久已游动在不少近代史学工作者的头脑中。要改变和扭转认识，一要丰富资料，二要学术胆识，三要艰苦研究，然后才有可能重立新论。《盛宣怀传》在这三点上确已有所体现。
    作者为自己研究近代人物概括了一条规律，即“评论中国近代史上的人物、事件有一个标准，即不仅要看对帝国主义、封建主义和中华民族、人民大众的认识、态度与作用，而且还要看对中国资本主义的认识、态度与作用”。这一概括简言之是要从政治和经济两方面去进行分析、得出结论。作者从肯定洋务运动的进步意义背景出发，抓住盛宣怀“办大事”、“作大官”两个主要方面展开论辩，从肯定前者、否定后者来贯穿全书，并以前者为基调。他肯定盛宣怀是“以经营中国社会发展需要的近代工商业为己任并卓有成效”，能“顺应历史发展趋势的佼佼者”（代序）。认为盛宣怀是一个资本主义工商业的有力经营者，所经营的轮船、电报、矿务、纺织企业都是“立国之要”，而这些事业无不具有适应时势需要和抵制洋商侵占权利的两大特点。这就必然为盛宣怀摘掉了“大买办”的帽子而成为反对封建经济、发展中国资本主义的历史人物。在中国近代半殖民地半封建这个历史大变动时期，以一人之力披荆斩棘地经办了这么多“立国之要”的企业，自然会引出盛宣怀是一个“处于非常之世，作非常之事的非常之人”的结论。这三个“非常”是作者撰著《盛宣怀传》所把握的主要线索。
    夏东元在《盛宣怀传》中以鲜明的笔触来改变衡量近代人物的传统观念。他指陈过去用“贪得无厌，赚取钱财”来鞭挞盛宣怀是不公正的，而认为“赚钱”正是盛宣怀的进步表现，因为“剩余价值规律曾经是推动历史前进的巨大杠杆力量”，全传以较多篇幅总结了盛宣怀的洋务思想体系，认为盛宣怀“在洋务商战思想上，从生产过程到流通过程，已形成较为完整的思想体系”，而这个“体系”的中心特征“就是要在发展经济上与洋商争斗，以致富强”。全传虽然没有对现实问题着墨一字，但这种历史结论会有力地引发读者对中国商品经济重要意义的了解和对资本主义，特别是对中国资本主义发展历史的再认识。这是本书内涵的重要意义。
    的确，以往对盛宣怀的评论确有不公之处。和盛宣怀同样从事“洋务”的郑观应、马建忠和徐润等人，都有着改良主义思想家和民用企业家之类的桂冠，而唯独具有商战思想，曾经办了轮船、电报、矿务和纺织等四大民用企业的盛宣怀却背上了“大买办”的恶名。夏东元为此将上述等人进行比较研究而后论定。他分析盛宣怀与马建忠为维护电报权利所产生的矛盾时，即以原始档案为主要论据，论定马建忠的“维护电报权利的感情不如盛宣怀深切”，而盛宣怀“保护中国电线电报权利是始终不渝的”，所以“在这一点，马建忠不及盛宣怀远矣！”他在评论盛宣怀与徐润争夺招商局权力的矛盾时，提出了一条新的是非规范，那就是“资产阶级竞争规律就是在获取尽可能多的利润原则下，挤倒对方，大鱼吃小鱼。”盛徐二人既都是资产阶级，那么“从大鱼吃小鱼”的资本主义竞争规律说是无可非议的。至于郑观应的成就，主要出自盛宣怀的一手提拔和支持。如此，盛宣怀的地位如何摆法，自可不言而喻。
    夏东元肯定盛宣怀经济上成就，多少使人感到有“发乎情”的意思；但史学家握的终究是史笔，他又“驭乎理”地指斥盛宣怀的反面。作者循着盛宣怀以“办大事”为资本，逐渐达到“作高官”目的这一人生道路，评论盛宣怀“既似商又似官，由似官而为官；用商力以谋官，由倾向于官发展到利用官势以凌商”，也即批评其“作高官”的另一面。作者论断“盛宣怀在变专制为民主的政治态度和观点上，不仅不及维新派，也赶不上某些洋务派官僚”，即使在论定盛宣怀与徐润是非，并褊爱盛时，指出盛宣怀“换官势以达目的则越出自由竞争范围”是不对的。作者揭示盛宣怀在义和团反帝运动中“对于直接损害到他的洋务企业、事业的义和团尤为愤慨和敌视”，表现出“对人民的反抗总是站在敌对的立场上”。而在处理中外关系时则“极力主张多多听从洋人的意见”。盛宣怀这个在发展经济上是“一只手捞十六颗夜明珠”的胜利贪馋者，在政治上却是日趋保守妥协，增强封建性和买办性。“终其生未能克服保守的政治主张与进步的经济实践间的矛盾”，便是作者对盛宣怀一生的总评价。
    当然，任何事物都会有瑕隙，《盛宣怀传》虽是一部力作，但也不是没有可吹求之处。作者根据史料，实事求是地重新论定盛宣怀是以三个“非常”作为主线。全传对于非常之人办非常之事是持之有故、言之成理的；但对这两个“非常”所置身的“非常之世”论述似有不足，如果对盛宣怀所处的“非常之世”再多加笔墨，就能显出一定的土壤而培育滋长一定的花草果木，更增加可信性而销融一下作者的感情之笔，而三个非常的环节也能扣得更紧。纵观全书，使人颇有情重的感觉，特别是全传结尾的末三行，对盛宣怀的政治态度进行了“如果”的假设。这是作者希望盛宣怀成为更完美的形象。可是历史是不接受假设的。如果删去这末三行，那么全传的结尾将更耐人寻味，发人深思。作者在掌握与运用史料上确见深厚功力，如在档案之外，再能扩及官书私乘、称说杂著以及时贤识见，当能益见功底而开拓读者视野。至于历史人物不仅有其成就的事业，也无可避免地有家庭生活、个人情趣和人际交往。《盛宣怀传》围绕传主的政治、经济两大事业立传，无疑足称严谨的“硬件”，如果能进而适度地点缀一些传主生活、情趣和交往等等“软件”，那么，一本立意新鲜、内容充实、软硬结合、人物丰满的传记将会使学术雨露更广袤地覆盖读者。
