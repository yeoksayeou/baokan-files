Vice Premier Song Jian emphasized at the closing of the 1989 National Earthquake Trend Consultation Meeting today that China's earthquake workers must strive to overcome the difficulties in earthquake prediction, deepen their understanding of earthquake activity patterns, and must not relax earthquake monitoring and prediction work.

Song Jian said that among the various natural disasters that humans face, earthquake disasters are the most severe. The occurrence of earthquakes is beyond human control. However, through scientific and technological efforts, the damage caused by earthquakes can be minimized.

He said: First, the earthquake department can collaborate with the government to issue long-term forecasts for regions that may experience major earthquakes in the coming years. This way, people can be aware of the earthquake trends, avoid major social disturbances, and plan for earthquake prevention and resistance work. Second, given that China is a country prone to frequent earthquakes, efforts must be made to strengthen the promotion of earthquake prevention and resistance knowledge. Various means and media should be used to intensify earthquake prevention and education in key regions. Third, in key earthquake prevention areas, earthquake departments, armed police, and government agencies should conduct preventive training for the release of forecasts to avoid panic in the event of an earthquake. Fourth, attention should be paid to recognizing and rewarding individuals who have contributed to earthquake prevention work, encouraging people to bravely fight against natural disasters when earthquakes occur, overcome fear, quickly restore production, rebuild homes, and minimize economic losses due to social paralysis.

Song Jian said that the entire society should have a full understanding and tolerance of earthquake work. At the current level of scientific and technological development, it is very difficult to expect the earthquake department to make accurate short-term and imminent forecasts, and it is impossible for them to completely avoid false or missed reports. However, no matter how great the difficulties, earthquake monitoring and prediction work must not be relaxed.

Song Jian finally urged the earthquake department to, under current limited material and financial conditions, concentrate a portion of scientific and technological personnel and funds on several key monitoring areas and earthquake prediction experimental sites, forming a work system with a solid scientific foundation. Song Jian also urged relevant departments and leaders at all levels to give sufficient attention and support to this work.

At today's closing ceremony, six advanced units, including the Gansu Earthquake Bureau, 13 advanced collectives, including the Kunming Remote Sensing Station of the Yunnan Earthquake Bureau, and 14 advanced earthquake workers, including Tong Wanglian, were commended.

　　国务委员宋健指出
    困难再大也不能放松地震预报
    希望全社会理解和支持地震工作
    本报北京１月１３日讯  记者王友恭报道：国务委员宋健在今天闭幕的１９８９年度全国地震趋势会商会上讲话时指出：我国的地震工作者要努力攻克地震预报难关，加深对地震活动规律的认识，决不能放松地震监测预报工作。
    宋健说，在人类所遭受的各种自然灾害中，地震灾害为群害之首。地震的发生是人们不可抗御的。但是通过科学技术等多方面的工作，可以使地震造成的损失尽量减小。
    他说：首先，地震部门可以配合政府对最近几年可能发生大震的重点地区发出长期预报。这样，让人们对地震趋势有所了解，不至引起大的社会震动，可以有计划地做好防震、抗震工作。第二，针对我国是一个多地震国家的特点，要加强对防震、抗震知识的宣传。利用各种手段和媒介，在重点地区加强防震工作的宣传教育。第三，在重点防震地区，要对地震部门、武警部队和政府机关公布预报等进行预防性训练，以免地震发生后不知所措。第四，要注意表彰和奖励那些在防震工作中有贡献的人员，鼓励人们在地震灾害出现后能坚强勇敢地与自然灾害进行斗争，克服恐惧心理，尽快恢复生产，重建家园，减少由于社会生活瘫痪而造成的经济损失。
    宋健说，全社会对地震工作要有充分的理解和谅解。在当前的科学技术水平上，还很难要求地震部门作出精确的短期预报和临震预报，要他们完全避免虚报或漏报也是不可能的。但是，无论有多大困难，地震监测预报工作绝不能放松。
    宋健最后要求地震部门在当前有限的物力和财力条件下，集中一部分科技骨干和财力，用于几个重点监测区和地震预报试验场，形成一个有坚实的科学基础的工作体系。宋健同时要求各有关部门和各级领导对这项工作给予足够的关心和支持。
    在今天的会议闭幕式上，还表彰了甘肃地震局等６个先进单位，云南地震局昆明遥测台等１３个先进集体和童汪练等１４名先进地震工作者。
