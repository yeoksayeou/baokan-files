The European Community Commission's statistics from the 4th of the month show that in 1988, the surplus agricultural products inventory of the Community significantly decreased compared to 1987, but the Community paid a huge price for this.

By September 30, 1988, compared to the same time last year, the Community's surplus grain inventory decreased by approximately 300 million tons, butter inventory decreased by 837,000 tons, and skimmed milk powder inventory decreased by 707,000 tons.

    欧洲共同体委员会四日的统计数字表明，一九八八年共同体的过剩农产品库存比一九八七年明显减少，但共同体为此付出了巨大的代价。
    截至一九八八年九月三十日，与一年前相比，共同体过剩谷物库存减少了约三百万吨，黄油库存减少八十三万七千吨，脱脂奶粉库存减少七十点七万吨。
