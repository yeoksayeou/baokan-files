The Air Force sent out hundreds of home visit teams last year to 29 provinces, municipalities, and autonomous regions across the country. They visited over 4,000 families of pilots, helping to resolve their difficulties and encouraging them to continue supporting their family members in their dedication to the aviation cause.

The relevant departments of the Air Force organized this home visit activity to further strengthen the relationship between the troops and the pilots, the troops and the families of the pilots, and the troops and the local governments. This initiative aims to mobilize the enthusiasm of all parties, to do a targeted job in the ideological and political work of the pilots, and to strengthen the construction of the pilot team. Each home visit team, when visiting a pilot's family, thoroughly introduces the pilot's situation in the unit and their instructions to their family members. This helps the families of the pilots to have a deeper understanding of the role and importance of pilots, as well as the country's care, training, and special requirements for pilots. As a result, the families become more proactive in caring about the growth and progress of the pilots and assist the unit in doing the ideological work of the pilots. After returning to the unit, the home visit teams also bring the expectations of the families and local governments to the pilots, achieving good educational results.

In addition to ideological work, the Air Force's pilot home visit teams, with the assistance of local governments, have solved practical problems such as housing, children's schooling and kindergarten enrollment, job transfers, and economic difficulties for a number of pilot families. This has been highly praised by the pilots and their families.

　　空军派出几百个家访小组为飞行人员家庭送温暖
    新华社北京１月２３日电（记者齐含笑）空军去年派出几百个家访小组分赴全国２９个省、市、自治区，访问了４０００多户飞行人员的亲属，为他们排忧解难，勉励他们更加热情支持自己的亲人献身飞行事业。
    空军有关部门组织这次家访活动，旨在进一步密切部队与飞行人员、部队与飞行人员家庭、部队与地方政府的关系，调动各方面的积极性，有的放矢地做好飞行人员的思想政治工作，加强飞行人员队伍建设。家访小组每访问一户飞行人员家庭，都详细地介绍飞行人员在部队的情况和他们对亲人的嘱托，使飞行人员亲属更深刻地了解飞行员的地位、作用，以及国家对飞行员的关怀培养和特殊要求，从而更加主动关心飞行人员的成长进步，协助部队做好飞行人员的思想工作。家访小组回到部队后，又把亲人和地方政府的期望带给飞行人员，收到了很好的教育效果。
    空军飞行人员家访小组在做好思想工作的同时，还在地方政府的协助下，为一批飞行人员家庭解决了住房、子女入学入托、调动工作、经济困难等实际问题，受到了飞行人员及其家属的赞扬。
