The Beijing Broadcasting Equipment Factory has implemented a market-leading business strategy, targeting both domestic and international markets to develop new products. Last year, they successfully developed 30 new types of broadcasting and television equipment that can replace imports.

Originally a military equipment manufacturer, the Beijing Broadcasting Equipment Factory has seen a significant reduction in military orders since 1979, forcing the enterprise to turn to the market. In the face of market competition, they created a market-leading business strategy, developing potential markets. As early as 1979, after conducting surveys and research, they determined that the Chinese market had a latent demand for television equipment. They promptly adjusted their product structure and quickly developed new color television transmission equipment, rapidly achieving the capability to mass-produce UHF television transmitters and converter series products. Subsequently, they introduced new products of various power levels. Over the past nine years, the factory has supplied 3,500 sets of domestically produced television transmission equipment to the country, accounting for 80% of the domestic transmission equipment in use, saving the country $150 million in foreign exchange.

　　以国货代替进口产品初见成效
  　北京广播器材厂调整产品结构
    本报讯  北京广播器材厂实行市场先导经营战略，瞄准国内、国际两个市场开发新产品。去年一年就研制成功了３０种可替代进口的新型广播电视设备。
    北京广播器材厂原是一家军工企业。１９７９年以来军品任务大幅度下降，迫使企业转向市场。他们在市场竞争中创造了市场先导的经营战略，把潜在的市场开发出来。早在１９７９年，他们就经过调查研究，认定我国市场对电视设备有着潜在需要，于是果断地调整了产品结构，迅速开发出新型彩色电视发送设备，很快形成了批量生产米波段电视发射机、差转机系列产品的能力。尔后，又推出了各种功率等级的新产品。９年来，这家工厂已向全国提供了３５００部（套）国产化的电视发射设备，占国内现有发射设备的８０％，为国家节省外汇１．５亿美元。
