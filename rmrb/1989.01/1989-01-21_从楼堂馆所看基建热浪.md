	Because Beijing is so vast, stretching from Qinghe in the north to Nanyuan in the south, and from Dingfuzhuang in the east to the Capital Steel Company in the west, the 750 square kilometers are dotted with over 200 construction sites for buildings and facilities. It might not seem too dense. Therefore, some people still say: "Buildings and facilities must be constructed; otherwise, how can we achieve the modernization and beautification of the capital?"

	"High, Big, Spacious": Products of the "Overspending" Trend

	"High" refers to the increasing height of buildings. In urban construction, developing high-rise buildings to save land is quite natural. However, the blind pursuit of height, disregarding our country's economic development level, is indeed a problem. Listen to the popular language from the construction departments and units: "Three or five stories are outdated, ten or eight stories are nothing special, fifteen or twenty stories are just average, thirty or forty stories are decent."

	Look at the "Literary Hall" located on the bustling Wangfujing Street, designed to be 14 stories high. The "Grand Hotel" built in Shuangyushu is 21 stories high. The "Sichuan Building" located northwest of the Fuchengmen Interchange has 30 stories above and below ground, covering 88,900 square meters, with only 1/10 of the area used for commercial purposes to "boost the capital's market." There are even taller ones; a 50-story "tower" will rise by the Liangma Bridge.

	"Big" refers to the increasing size of buildings. Nowadays, in the eyes of many constructors in Beijing, buildings covering a few thousand square meters are considered "small stuff." They either do not build at all or, if they do, they aim for tens of thousands of square meters; constructing buildings covering fifty or sixty thousand, seventy or eighty thousand square meters is not uncommon.

	Look at the "Art Center" located on the East Third Ring Road, covering 58,000 square meters. The "Office Building" of a center located southeast of the Dongsi Interchange covers 69,000 square meters. The "Trade Center" in Gongzhufen covers a massive 131,000 square meters. Interestingly, a project named "Television Relay Center" actually needs only 4,000 square meters for installing technical equipment, but the reported and approved area is 40,000 square meters. This is not a drafting error on the design drawings, adding an extra "0," but a deliberate attempt to "hitch a ride," adding guest rooms, apartments, cafes, and entertainment rooms.

	"Spacious" refers to buildings being both "high" and "big," with luxurious construction standards.

	Currently, the construction cost per square meter for general guesthouses and hotels in the capital is around 1,000 yuan. However, an "Office Building" planned for East Chang'an Street, covering 18,000 square meters, has an investment estimate of 29 million yuan, making the construction cost per square meter 1,600 yuan. A "Financial Center" built inside Xinchengmen covers 39,000 square meters, with an investment of 91.13 million yuan, making the construction cost per square meter 2,300 yuan. A "Customs Building" inside Jianguo Gate covers 28,000 square meters, with an investment of 70 million yuan, making the construction cost per square meter exactly 2,500 yuan. The 50-story "tower" located by the Liangma Bridge covers 135,000 square meters, with an investment of 596 million yuan, making the construction cost per square meter a staggering 4,420 yuan.

	We are not generally against "high, big, spacious," but we emphasize that urban construction must be coordinated with the national economy. Contrary to this "overspending" trend, some economists and scholars believe that the modernization of the capital should focus on modern public facilities, science and technology, culture, education, and "high-tech" industries, and should strive to benefit the broad masses.

	Forcibly Associating with an "International" Element: An Excuse to Expand Scale

	Implementing the open-door policy, the state adopts various preferential policies to encourage the introduction of foreign capital and advanced production technologies and equipment, aiming to accelerate the development of the national economy and social productivity. Indeed, in the early stages of opening up, when the tourism industry was just starting, introducing foreign capital to build some hotels and restaurants was necessary. However, we cannot use this as an excuse to move heaven and earth, associate everything with the "international" element, and build buildings and facilities.

	In Beijing, not to mention the completed and operational Sino-foreign joint ventures and cooperative buildings and facilities, there are dozens of projects under construction and preparing to start, and most of them are "large-scale." Some projects require materials and equipment produced abroad, and some projects even require foreign companies and personnel to handle the design and construction. Funds are borrowed from abroad, and the investment estimate is calculated in foreign currency and foreign exchange. In short, everything seems to need an "international" element to be considered "good." Some construction units and individuals even shamelessly force an "international" element as a shield to avoid halting construction.

	The relevant personnel of a project near the Sanlihe Interchange said that a foreign head of state, when passing through here during a visit to China, had introduced this project to him; if construction were halted, it would have a negative impact internationally.

	The relevant personnel of an "Information Center" project near Dabeiying said: This project was once considered for foreign investment three years ago, but it was not allowed to proceed; if it had been allowed, it would have become a Sino-foreign joint venture project and could be given special treatment today. Their words expressed deep regret.

	The relevant departments of a hotel expansion project in Chegongzhuang arbitrarily used international loans, thus it was said to be an international project. And so on.

	Government Agencies Engaging in Business: Bubbles of Disorderly Economics

	Browsing through the list of buildings and facilities in Beijing, one can easily find that many administrative agencies, public institutions, and mass organizations that already have guesthouses are building hotels or restaurants. From an economic perspective, this is where the bubbles of disorderly economic thinking are emerging.

	A 21-story building under construction at the True Martial Temple outside Xinchengmen is said to be built for hosting large-scale conferences. In fact, the construction unit of this project already has a guesthouse outside Jianguo Gate and has recently built a high-rise hotel there, leasing out some of the rooms. People are discussing how many large-scale conferences this unit can hold each year and how long each conference lasts.

	The "Grand Hotel" built in Huangsi, the "Tower" inside Jianguo Gate, the "Hotel" and "Tower" respectively built at the west entrance of Dengshikou and the east side of the Workers' Stadium, and so on, all have similar situations. They have guest rooms, with the fewest having 200-300 rooms and the most having 500-600 rooms, as well as large and small dining rooms, bars, parking lots, recreation, and cultural and sports facilities. The construction units emphasize that this is done for the convenience of their system and unit. It seems that convenience is the name, but the essence is to engage in business and make money.

	An economic theorist believes that administrative agencies and party and mass organizations using buildings and facilities for commercial operations reflect, in theory, the thinking of disorderly economics, and in practice, it is worth considering whether it is legal, as it is not much different from government agencies engaging in commerce (running companies).

	A veteran who has long been engaged in urban construction appeals: For hotels, restaurants, office buildings, office spaces, and various "centers" and other buildings and facilities, it is necessary to consider implementing a unified management system. We can no longer continue to build redundantly in this way, causing such a large amount of waste and loss of the state's limited financial and material resources.

	From this, it can be seen that to rectify the economic environment and order, we must rectify and regulate some of the muddled thinking among some cadres. Of course, rectifying thinking can only be achieved through rectifying the economic environment. We are pleased to see that the buildings and facilities in Beijing are being seriously investigated, and many projects have been ordered to halt construction. The leadership of the construction departments and units is also improving their awareness, and some have begun to summarize experiences and learn lessons. This is what people hope for.

　　从楼堂馆所看基建热浪
    本报记者  鲁牧
    由于北京城地盘太大，北起清河、南至南苑，东自定福庄、西到首都钢铁公司，７５０多平方公里面积上点缀着二三百个楼堂馆所工地，似乎不显怎样稠密。因而，有人至今还在说：“楼堂馆所不能不盖，否则如何实现首都现代化、美化市容市貌？”
    　　　　“高、大、阔”：“超前消费”思潮的产物
    “高”者，楼层愈来愈高也。在城市建设中，为节省土地而发展高层建筑，是极其自然的。但那种脱离我国经济发展水平，盲目攀比、追求层高，却不能不说是个问题。请听，来自建设部门、单位的流行语言：“三层五层的早已过时，十层八层的不在话下，十五二十层的马马虎虎，三十四十层的才像样子。”
    请看，选址于繁华商业区王府井大街的一个“文学会堂”，设计高达１４层。建在双榆树的一个“大酒店”，高２１层。定址于阜成门立交桥西北侧的“四川大厦”，地下地上３０层，建筑面积８．８９万平方米，而真正为“繁荣首都市场”的商业用房面积只占１／１０，还有更高的，一座５０层“大厦”将在亮马桥畔崛起。
    “大”者，建筑面积越来越大也。如今，在京城不少建设者的眼里，几千平方米的楼堂馆所已被视为“小玩艺”。他们不搞则已，要搞动辄就是一两万、三四万平方米；建造五六万、七八万平方米的楼堂馆所，亦非少数。
    请看，位于东三环路的一座“艺术大厦”，建筑面积达５．８万平方米。东四十条立交桥东南侧一个中心的“办公楼”，建筑面积为６．９万平方米。公主坟一个“贸易中心”的建筑面积，大到１３．１万平方米。耐人寻味的是，一个名为“电视转播中心”的项目，安装技术设备实际需要建筑面积４０００平方米，而申报审批却为４万平方米。这不是设计图纸上笔误所致，多画了一个“○”，而是有意借机“搭车”，增添了客房、公寓、咖啡厅、娱乐室之类的结果。
    “阔”者，建筑物“高”、“大”并蓄，外加建设标准攀豪华比阔气也。
    眼下，首都一般招待所、旅馆每平方米的造价，大都在１０００元左右。而拟建在东长安街的一个机关“办公楼”，建筑面积１．８万平方米，投资概算２９００万元，每平方米造价即为１６００元。建在复兴门内的一个“金融中心”，３．９万平方米，投资９１１３万元，每平方米造价达２３００元；建国门内的一个“海关大楼”，２．８万平方米，投资７０００万元，每平方米造价正好２５００元。坐落在亮马桥畔的那个５０层“大厦”，１３．５万平方米，投资５．９６亿元，每平方米造价达４４２０元之巨。
    我们并不一般地反对“高、大、阔”，而是强调城市建设必须与国民经济协调发展。同这“超前消费”思潮相反，一些经济专家学者认为，首都现代化理应着眼于现代化的公共设施、科学技术、文化教育和“高精尖”工业的发展，应在方便广大群众上下功夫。
    　　　　生拉硬扯一个“外”字：扩大规模的借口
    实行对外开放，国家采取种种优惠政策，给引进外资、引进先进生产技术设备以鼓励，旨在加快我国国民经济的发展，社会生产力的提高。诚然，在对外开放初期，旅游事业刚起步时，引进外资适当搞点宾馆、饭店尚属必要。但总不能借此移花接木，不惜付出一切代价，同“外”字挂钩，大搞楼堂馆所。
    在京城，已经建成、开张营业的中外合资、联营的楼堂馆所不说，正在施工建设和准备开工的项目又不下数十个之多，而且大都是“大个儿”的。有些项目，材料、设备要用外国生产的，有的项目甚至设计、施工都得要海外公司、人士来承担。资金向国外贷款，投资概算以外币、外汇计算。总之，似乎一切都带上一个　“外”字才“好”。更有甚者，少数建设单位个别人士大言不惭地生拉硬扯上一个“外”字来作为不愿停缓建的挡箭牌。
    三元立交桥那里一个项目的有关人员说，某外国元首来华访问路过这里时，曾向他介绍过这个项目；若是停缓建了，“对外将产生不良影响”。
    大北窑那里一个“信息中心”项目的有关人员则称：该项目３年前曾有外籍厂商要来投资，没让干；如果当时让干了，也就成了中外合资项目，今天可给照顾。言表之中，追悔莫及。
    车公庄那里有个饭店扩建工程，有关部门擅自转手动用了国际贷款，于是被说成是涉外项目。如此等等。
    　　　　机关搞经营：无秩序经济的泡沫
    浏览京城楼堂馆所目录，不难发现不少已有招待所的行政机关、事业单位、群众团体，又在建宾馆或酒店。从经济学角度看，这里正泛起无秩序经济思潮的泡沫。
    在复兴门外真武庙兴建的一座２１层大楼，说是为接待大型会议而盖的。实际上，该项目的建设单位在建国门外早就有个招待所，新近又在那里建了一个很像样的高层大宾馆，并已对外出租了部分客房。人们在议论，这个单位一年能开几次大型会议？每次大会会期多长？
    建在黄寺的一个“大饭店”，建国门内的一个“大厦”，分别建在灯市西口、工体东路的“饭店”、“大厦”等等，都有类似情形。其拥有客房，少者二三百间，多则五六百间，还有大小餐厅、酒吧、车库、康乐、文体等设施。建设单位强调，这样做为的是本系统、本单位使用方便。看来，图方便是名，实质却是想搞经营、赚钱。
    有位经济理论工作者认为，行政机关、党群团体利用楼堂馆所搞商业性经营，在理论上是无秩序经济思想的反映，在实践上是否合法值得考虑，因为它同机关经商（办公司）的性质无大区别。
    一位长期从事城市建设的老干部呼吁：对宾馆、饭店、办公楼、写字间、各种“中心”等楼堂馆所，是该考虑实行统一管理制度，再不能继续这样各自为政地重复建设，使国家有限的财力物力蒙受如此大量的浪费和损失。　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　
    由此看来，治理经济环境，整顿经济秩序，须得治理、整顿一些干部中的浑浑思潮。当然，整治思想，只能在整治经济环境中得以实现。我们欣喜地看到，京城楼堂馆所正在进行认真的清查，不少项目已经明令停缓建，建设部门、单位领导干部的思想认识也在提高，有的还开始注意总结经验，吸取教训。这正是人们所希望的。
