		Cultivate Good Vegetable Gardens to Ensure Vegetable Supply
		Nanjing's Vegetable Supply is Affordable and Abundant

		According to a report from Market News, a year ago, Nanjing's vegetable supply was of poor quality and insufficient quantity, with high prices. Residents walked around with empty baskets, expressing their dissatisfaction. Now, state-run vegetable markets have ample supplies, with many green vegetables priced at just a few jiao per kilogram; prices in farmers' markets are stable, and stalls are everywhere.

		Why has Nanjing's vegetable supply improved so dramatically? The director of the Municipal Vegetable Bureau, Bi Jinshan, told reporters that the key is that the municipal leadership has prioritized the "Vegetable Basket Project," investing 15 million yuan to build vegetable gardens. Last year, nearly 5,600 mu of perennial vegetable fields were added in the suburbs, and 5,000 mu of second-line vegetable fields in the outer suburbs and third-line fields in northern Jiangsu were developed. These fields provided Nanjing's market with over 7 million kilograms of vegetables last winter.

		To mitigate natural disasters, the municipal government invested 2 million yuan last year to repair over 80 irrigation stations and 11 long-distance water diversion pipelines from the Yangtze River. In September, a severe drought occurred, the worst in nearly 70 years, but irrigation played a crucial role. Despite the drought, there was no shortage of vegetables, and production even increased by 10 million kilograms compared to the same period last year. Additionally, more plastic greenhouse vegetable fields were established. The city sent over 40 technical personnel last year to the front lines, implementing unified pest and disease forecasting and prevention for over 80% of the city's vegetable fields. They established 51 seedling nurseries in 13 major vegetable-producing towns in the suburbs, guiding farmers to cultivate 80 million seedlings, accounting for two-thirds of the city's total summer vegetable seedling needs. To address the shortage of farm labor, 500 tractors were purchased last year, and several mechanized farming service stations were established. Each mu of land incurs a cost of 2 to 3 yuan, providing farming services for farmers. Out of the city's 180,000 mu of vegetable cultivation land, 120,000 mu used mechanized farming, even reclaiming 3,000 mu of long-abandoned vegetable fields.

		Furthermore, they leveraged the role of the vegetable company as the main channel. The vegetable company signed guidance contracts with over 700 production teams in the city that primarily grow vegetables, coordinating production and sales, communicating information, and facilitating the import and export of vegetables.

### 种好菜园子　保证菜篮子  南京蔬菜供应价廉货足

　　种好菜园子　保证菜篮子
    南京蔬菜供应价廉货足
    本报讯  据市场报报道，一年前，南京蔬菜供应质次量少，价格昂贵。居民们拎着空篮子满街转圈，怨声不断。如今，国营菜场货源充足，许多青菜每公斤售价二三角钱；农贸市场菜价平稳，摊点比比皆是。
    南京的蔬菜供应，为什么像变戏法似地改观了？市蔬菜局局长毕金山对记者说，关键是市领导将“菜篮子工程”摆上了位置，投资１５００万元，进行菜园子建设。去年，新增近郊长年菜地５６００亩，开发远郊二线菜地和苏北的三线菜地５０００亩。这些菜地去年冬季已向南京的市场提供蔬菜７００多万公斤。
    为了抵御自然灾害，去年，市政府投资２００万元，将８０多个排灌站和１１条长江取水的翻水线路修复。９月份，发生了近７０年来罕见的旱灾，水利灌溉发挥了作用，天旱竟然不缺菜，比上年同期还增收１０００万公斤。还增加了塑料大棚菜地，市里去年又派出４０多名技术人员，深入第一线，对全市８０％以上的菜地，实行统一病虫预测，防治病害。他们在近郊主要种菜的１３个乡，建立５１个育苗点，指导菜农育植８０００万棵种苗，占全市夏菜种苗总用量２／３。为了解决菜农劳力不足，去年添置５００台拖拉机，建立若干个机耕服务站，每亩收取２至３元成本费，为菜农耕种服务。全市１８万亩（次）蔬菜耕地面积中，有１２万亩（次）使用了机耕，连常年抛荒的３０００亩菜地，也重新利用起来。
    此外，他们还发挥蔬菜公司主渠道作用。蔬菜公司与全市７００多个以种植蔬菜为主的生产队，签订指导性合同，根据市场需求，协调产销关系，沟通信息，做好调进调出工作。
