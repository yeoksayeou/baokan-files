The Lanzhou Military Region has decided to simplify Spring Festival activities to ensure that leaders at all levels can focus on their work without getting bogged down in formal visits and greetings. The decision aims to streamline the festivities and allow leaders to concentrate on their duties.

According to a report from Xinhua News Agency in Lanzhou on January 29, many people have long complained that "celebrating the New Year is more tiring than going to work." To address this issue, the Lanzhou Military Region has decided to start simplifying Spring Festival activities from the military region's leadership organs.

The Lanzhou Military Region, in coordination with local authorities, has agreed to hold only one joint reception for party, government, and military leaders before the New Year, eliminating other forms of mutual visits and meetings. The military region's leadership organs have also instructed their staff not to visit the homes of current military region leaders and department heads to offer New Year greetings. Additionally, it is strictly forbidden to send any form of gifts to military region leaders and department heads.

　　兰州军区从简安排春节活动
    据新华社兰州１月２９日电（记者顾月忠、通讯员曹振平）“过年比上班还累”，这是多年来许多人的苦衷。兰州军区为保证各级领导干部不陷入繁琐的礼节性走访、拜年中去，集中精力抓好本单位本部门的工作，最近决定从军区领导机关做起，从简安排春节活动。
    兰州军区经同地方商定，军地节前只举办一次党政军联合团拜会，不再进行其它形式的互相走访、座谈等活动。军区领导机关还要求机关干部不必到军区现职领导和机关各部门负责同志家拜年，更不准以任何形式给军区领导和机关送礼。
