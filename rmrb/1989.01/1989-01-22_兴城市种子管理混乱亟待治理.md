	Editor,

	The production and management of seeds in Xingcheng City, Liaoning Province, are in a state of chaos. There is a lack of unified planning and management. Various townships and many farmers are indiscriminately cultivating corn hybrid seeds and selling them at high prices without the necessary "three certificates," causing losses in some areas' grain production.

	The so-called "three certificates" refer to the seed production permit, seed business permit, and seed quality inspection certificate. Relevant departments have stipulated that units or individuals without these "three certificates" are not allowed to produce or sell seeds.

	The seed company in Xingcheng City has developed and produced the high-quality corn hybrid seed "Danyu 13," which is resistant to diseases and lodging, has a high yield, and is popular among farmers in various places. It has been in high demand for many years. Seeing the profitability in seed production and sales, some townships and farmers began to multiply seeds starting from the end of 1986. Local governments also promoted seed production as a path to prosperity for farmers. Due to the lack of "three certificates," they could not obtain transportation permits from the provincial authorities, so the townships used various channels to transport the seeds out of Xingcheng under the guise of commercial grain. Only after the municipal government issued an order to prohibit this did the chaotic situation stop from worsening.

	In 1988, Xingcheng City faced a shortage of sorghum seeds. The agricultural stations in Yiaowang and Jiumen townships privately purchased a batch of sorghum seeds from outside and sold them to farmers, resulting in reduced grain yields in the autumn.

	It is puzzling that the relevant authorities, aware of the townships' chaotic seed cultivation and violation of national policies and provincial regulations, not only did not stop it but actively supported it.

	Currently, employees of the seed company have written to relevant departments requesting an investigation and resolution. Farmers from Puyang, Henan, have also written to the State Administration for Industry and Commerce to report the discovery of counterfeit and substandard seeds in their area. In response to the chaotic situation in Xingcheng City's seed production and management, what effective measures will the relevant departments take?

### 兴城市种子管理混乱亟待治理

　　兴城市种子管理混乱亟待治理编辑同志：
    辽宁省兴城市种子生产和经营十分混乱，缺乏统一的计划管理，各乡和许多农民胡乱培育玉米杂交种子，在没有“三证”的情况下，高价售出，给一些地方粮食生产造成损失。
    所谓“三证”，即种子生产许可证，种子经营许可证，种子质量检验证。有关部门规定，没有“三证”的单位或个人不得生产和经营种子。
    兴城市种子公司研制生产的优良玉米杂交种“丹育１３号”由于抗病、抗倒伏、产量高，受到各地农民的欢迎，多年来一直畅销不衰。一些乡和农民看到生产和经营种子有利可图，便从１９８６年末开始，纷纷繁育种子，各乡政府也把生产种子当成农民致富的门路而加以提倡。由于没有“三证”，得不到省里颁发的运输证明，种子运不出本地，各乡便通过种种渠道以商品粮的名义运出兴城，经市政府下令禁止才避免了混乱局面的进一步发展。
    １９８８年，兴城市高粱种子短缺，药王、旧门两乡农业站私自从外地买进一批高粱种子，卖给农民，造成秋后粮食减产。
    令人不解的是，有关主管部门领导明知各乡农民胡乱育种，违反了国家政策和省有关文件，但不仅不加制止，反而大力支持。
    目前，种子公司的职工已写信给有关部门要求调查解决，河南濮阳的农民也写信给国家工商行政管理局反映他们那里发现伪劣种子的情况，针对兴城市种子生产和经营的混乱局面，有关部门将拿出什么得力措施？
