	Soviet scholars predict that 1989 will be a year of stabilization in international relations.

	New China News Agency, Moscow, December 31, 1988 - As the old year ends and the new one begins, authoritative Soviet international affairs experts have expressed optimism about the international situation in 1989, believing it will be a year of stabilizing international relations.

	The predictions of several institute directors from the Soviet Academy of Sciences were published in the first issue of 1989 of the weekly magazine "New Times."

	Yevgeny Primakov, Director of the Institute of World Economy and International Relations, believes that the "main prize" that can be achieved in 1989 is the "Soviet-American agreement to reduce strategic weapons by 50%." The complete withdrawal of Soviet troops from Afghanistan will also promote the resolution of other regional conflicts.

	Boris Pankin, Director of the Institute of Oriental Studies, believes that Sino-Soviet relations will make progress. The high-level meeting between the two countries, which may take place in the spring or summer of next year, will complete the normalization of relations between the two countries, which has been ongoing for many years. He believes that the objective conditions and the subjective wishes of both countries are now in place. He estimates that it is possible that Gorbachev will visit Japan next year, and that high-level talks between North and South Korea may also take place.

	Georgi Arbatov, Director of the Institute of the USA and Canada, believes that Soviet-American relations will not deteriorate or escalate. However, he is concerned that Soviet-American relations may stagnate or be in a state of "idling," as the new Bush administration lacks strategic or specific policy ideas for the future development of Soviet-American relations.

	Vladimir Zhurkin, Director of the Institute of Europe, believes that in the process of building a "common European house," Europe will become more stable. Mutual visits between Soviet leaders and Western European leaders will become more frequent. Negotiations on conventional forces in Europe will begin.

　　苏联学者展望一九八九年
    国际关系将趋于稳定
    新华社莫斯科１９８８年１２月３１日电  在送旧迎新之际，苏联的权威国际问题专家对１９８９年的国际形势表示乐观，认为它将是国际关系趋于稳定的一年。
    苏联科学院的几位研究所所长对国际形势的预测发表在《新时代》周刊１９８９年第一期上。
    世界经济和国际关系研究所所长普里马科夫认为，１９８９年“可获得的主要奖品是苏美削减５０％战略武器条约”，苏军完全撤出阿富汗将推动其他各种地区冲突的解决。
    东方学研究所所长贾丕才认为，苏中关系将取得进展，可能于明年春夏举行的苏中最高级会晤将完成进行多年的两国关系正常化工作，目前既具备客观条件，又具备两国的主观愿望。他估计明年可能实现戈尔巴乔夫访日，朝鲜北南双方也可能举行高级对话。
    美国和加拿大研究所所长阿尔巴托夫认为，苏美关系不会恶化或激化。但他担心苏美关系会处于停滞或“打空转”的状态，因为布什新政府对苏美关系的今后发展尚缺乏战略或具体政策上的设想。
    欧洲研究所所长茹尔金认为，在建设“全欧大厦”的过程中，欧洲将变得更加稳定，苏联领导人同西欧国家领导人的互访将更频繁。欧洲常规裁军谈判将开始。
