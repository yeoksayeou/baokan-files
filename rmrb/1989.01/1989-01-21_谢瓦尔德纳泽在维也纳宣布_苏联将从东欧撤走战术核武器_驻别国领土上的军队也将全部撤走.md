	Shevardnadze Announces Soviet Withdrawal of Tactical Nuclear Weapons from Eastern Europe

	Vienna, Jan. 19 (Xinhua) - Soviet Foreign Minister Eduard Shevardnadze announced today that the Soviet Union will withdraw its tactical nuclear weapons from Eastern Europe as part of its unilateral troop reduction plan. He stated that the Soviet government will adhere to its declared goal of withdrawing all its troops stationed on foreign soil. He also reiterated the Warsaw Pact countries' desire to hold talks with NATO on the reduction of tactical nuclear weapons.

	Shevardnadze pointed out that the Soviet Union has decided to unilaterally reduce its 500,000 troops, 10,000 tanks, 8,500 artillery pieces, and 800 combat aircraft stationed in Eastern Europe before the upcoming negotiations on the reduction of conventional forces in Europe (from the Atlantic to the Urals) and the establishment of security and confidence-building measures in Europe. The Soviet Union does not intend to modernize its tactical nuclear weapons, as any modernization would mean a step backward.

	Shevardnadze also proposed holding a summit of the 35 heads of state of the Conference on Security and Cooperation in Europe (CSCE) next year to promote conventional arms reduction talks in Europe.

	Regarding the Vienna follow-up meeting of the CSCE, the Soviet foreign minister called it a "new miracle in the Helsinki process" and a "milestone on the road to a qualitatively new Europe."

	Shevardnadze said that security encompasses many aspects, including not only military security but also political, legal, social, and cultural protection for nations and individuals. The ongoing reforms in the Soviet Union will focus on ensuring more human rights and maintaining human dignity.

	He noted that many European countries are composed of multiple ethnic groups, and it is important to preserve the cultural heritage of all nations. This is equally important for Soviet citizens who have moved abroad or for foreign citizens residing in the Soviet Union.

	The Soviet Union aims to eliminate obstacles in economic, technological, and industrial cooperation in Europe. The purpose of the Soviet economic reforms is to closely cooperate economically with other countries. In this regard, the Soviet foreign minister particularly emphasized the cooperation agreements signed between the European Community and the Council for Mutual Economic Assistance (CMEA).

	Shevardnadze finally stressed that the Vienna follow-up meeting of the CSCE is a "turning point for Europe." The Helsinki process has provided the key to developing East-West relations. The achievements of the Vienna follow-up meeting make the project of building a "common European house" among CSCE countries increasingly possible.

　　谢瓦尔德纳泽在维也纳宣布
  　苏联将从东欧撤走战术核武器     
    驻别国领土上的军队也将全部撤走
    新华社维也纳１月１９日电（记者肖力）苏联外长谢瓦尔德纳泽１９日在维也纳宣布，苏联在按计划单方面从东欧部分撤军的同时，还将撤走其装备的战术核武器。他表示，苏联政府将遵循其宣布的目标，即从别国领土上撤除其全部驻军。他还重申了华约国家就裁减战术核武器同北约举行会谈的愿望。
    谢瓦尔德纳泽指出，苏联在即将开始的裁减全欧（从大西洋到乌拉尔山脉）常规军备谈判和欧洲建立安全和信任措施谈判之前就决定单方面裁减其驻东欧的５０万军队，１万辆坦克，８５００门大炮和８００架战斗机。苏联并不想更新其战术核武器，因为对战术核武器的任何一种现代化将意味着倒退。
    谢瓦尔德纳泽还在其讲话中再次提出于明年举行一次欧安会３５国首脑会晤，以推动欧洲常规裁军谈判。
    关于欧安会维也纳续会，苏联外长称之为“赫尔辛基进程中的新奇迹”，“是通往在质量上全新的欧洲道路上的里程碑”。
    谢瓦尔德纳泽说，安全是包括多方面的，除了军事安全以外，还有在政治、法律、社会和文化等方面对民族和个人的保护。苏联目前正在推行的改革进程将集中在保证更多的人权和维护人的尊严等方面。
    他说，欧洲的许多国家都是多民族组成，因此维护所有民族自己的文化遗产，离开自己家乡的人不能失去本民族的精神和文化传统。这对离开苏联移居国外的公民或在苏联定居的外来公民都同等重要。
    苏联的目标是消除在欧洲经济、技术和工业合作中的障碍。苏联经济改革的目的就是要同其它国家密切经济合作。在这方面，苏联外长尤其强调了欧共体和经互会签订的合作协定。
    谢瓦尔德纳泽最后强调，欧安会维也纳续会是“欧洲的分水岭”。赫尔辛基进程使欧洲找到了发展东西方关系的钥匙。维也纳续会取得的成果使建立欧安会国家间“共同的欧洲大厦”项目越来越成为可能。
