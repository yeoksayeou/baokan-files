The spokesperson of the State Council Taiwan Affairs Office today spoke to Xinhua News Agency reporters about the functions of the State Council Taiwan Affairs Office, the situation regarding Taiwan-related matters, and the prospects for cross-strait exchanges.

The spokesperson said that the State Council Taiwan Affairs Office is a newly established institution. As the office responsible for handling Taiwan-related matters for the State Council, it will follow the policies and guidelines set by the government, actively organizing, directing, managing, and coordinating the work of various departments under the State Council and the governments of provinces, autonomous regions, and municipalities directly under the Central Government. The goal is to promote the easing of cross-strait relations and the further development of mutual exchanges.

The spokesperson said that the facts have shown that enhancing cross-strait exchanges and achieving peaceful unification is an irreversible historical trend. Over the past year, more than 400,000 Taiwanese compatriots have come to the mainland for visits, tourism, and business. Recently, the Taiwanese side has conditionally accepted mainland compatriots visiting Taiwan for medical treatment and funerals, and mainland residents have begun to reunite with their relatives in Taiwan. With the efforts of relevant parties, the air route from Xiamen to Keelung via Naha, Japan, has been opened. Although the Taiwanese authorities still have many restrictions on cross-strait economic, cultural, sports, scientific, and academic exchanges, which are not entirely satisfactory, the cross-strait relationship has indeed changed from the previous state of complete isolation.

The spokesperson said that to further develop cross-strait exchanges and correctly handle issues that arise, and to protect the legitimate rights and interests of compatriots on both sides, the State Council Taiwan Affairs Office is working with relevant parties to study and formulate policies and regulations for developing cross-strait exchanges. Efforts are being made to push various regions to do a good job in handling Taiwan-related matters. For example, in trade, issues such as transportation, settlement, trademarks, inspection, arbitration, and compensation; in investment and factory establishment, issues such as project evaluation, bidding, patents, and profits; in cultural, scientific, and academic exchanges, issues such as remuneration, copyrights, and patents; and in personnel exchanges, issues such as residence, marriage, and inheritance, will all be addressed from the perspective of mutual benefit for the people on both sides, and specific management measures and regulations will be gradually formulated.

The spokesperson emphasized that cross-strait economic, cultural exchanges, and personnel interactions are practical steps toward ultimately achieving national peaceful unification, which requires the joint efforts of both sides. We will continue, as always, to do a good job in receiving Taiwanese compatriots visiting the mainland, to do a good job in handling mainland residents visiting Taiwan, and to promote various exchanges in economics, culture, sports, science, and academia. We will also timely study and solve problems that arise.

The spokesperson pointed out that through the long-term efforts of the people on both sides of the Taiwan Strait, the relationship between the mainland and Taiwan has undergone significant changes. However, this change is still far from the goal of "three links" and peaceful unification proposed in the "Message to Compatriots in Taiwan." It is worth noting that although the Taiwanese authorities have taken some measures to ease cross-strait relations, they still insist on an anti-communist and anti-unification stance, continuing to emphasize so-called "enemy consciousness" and setting artificial obstacles for the smooth development of cross-strait relations. For example, they insist that cross-strait mail must go through a third party, that passenger ships must transfer at a third party, that direct trade between the two sides is not allowed, and that Communist Party members are restricted from visiting Taiwan, etc. These measures not only affect exchanges between the two sides but also go against the interests of the nation and the ethnic group, and are not conducive to the stability and development of Taiwan.

The spokesperson finally said that dialogue and exchange are the trend of the times. How much more so for the people of the same ethnicity and the same country on both sides of the Taiwan Strait, who should engage in dialogue and exchange. Although the two sides of the Taiwan Strait have been separated for forty years, the compatriots on both sides have never severed their blood ties. Reunification and unification are something that no external forces can ever stop. For the sake of a faster and more prosperous motherland, the two sides of the Taiwan Strait should exchange and complement each other, increase understanding, and build consensus. We hope that the Taiwanese authorities will prioritize national and ethnic interests, jointly promote the good momentum of cross-strait exchanges, and contribute to the great cause of national peaceful unification.

### 国务院台湾事务办公室发言人指出  增进两岸交往实现和平统一不可逆转

　　国务院台湾事务办公室发言人指出
    增进两岸交往实现和平统一不可逆转
    新华社北京１月１８日电  国务院台湾事务办公室发言人今天就国务院台湾事务办公室的机构职能、涉台事务概况，以及两岸往来前景等问题，对新华社记者发表谈话。
    发言人说，国务院台湾事务办公室是新组建的一个机构。它作为国务院处理涉台事务的办事机构，将遵循政府制定的方针、政策，积极组织、指导、管理、协调国务院各部门，各省、自治区、直辖市的政府涉台工作，推动两岸关系的日益缓和、相互往来的进一步发展。
    发言人说，事实说明，增进两岸交往、实现和平统一是不可逆转的历史趋向。一年多来，来大陆探亲、旅游、经商的台胞已逾４０万人次。最近，台湾方面有条件地接受大陆同胞赴台探病、奔丧，大陆居民已开始有人得与亲人在台相聚。在有关人士的努力下，厦门经日本那霸到基隆的航线已经开通。尽管在两岸经贸、文化、体育、科技、学术交流等方面，台湾当局还有层层限制，未能尽如人意，但是两岸关系毕竟改变了过去完全隔绝的状态。
    发言人说，为了进一步发展两岸来往和正确处理交往中的问题，维护两岸同胞的正当权益，国务院台湾事务办公室正在会同有关方面研究拟定发展两岸交往的各项政策和法规，推动各地努力做好涉台工作。例如对贸易中的运输、结汇、商标、商检、仲裁、索赔，对投资设厂中的项目评估、招标、专利、利润，对文化、科技、学术交流中的酬付、版权、专利，对人员交往中的定居、婚姻、财产继承等具体问题，都将从两岸人民互相受益出发，逐步制定具体管理办法和规定。
    发言人强调，两岸的经济、文化交流和人员往来，是最终实现国家和平统一的实际步骤，需要两岸双方共同努力。我们将一如既往继续做好来大陆台胞的接待工作，做好大陆居民赴台的工作，做好促进两岸的经贸和文化、体育、科技、学术等各项交流工作，及时研究解决出现的问题。
    发言人指出，经过海峡两岸人民的长期努力，大陆与台湾之间的关系有了意义深远的变化。但这种变化，与《告台湾同胞书》提出的“三通”、和平统一的目标还相距甚远。值得注意的是，台湾当局尽管在缓和两岸关系方面，采取了一些松动措施，但仍坚持反共拒和的立场，继续强调所谓“敌对意识”，为两岸关系的顺利发展设置人为的障碍。诸如：坚持两岸通邮必须经过第三地，通航的客轮必须在第三地接驳，两岸不能直接贸易，限制共产党员赴台，等等。这既影响两岸之间的交往，也有违国家、民族的利益，不利于台湾的安定和发展。
    发言人最后说，对话、交流是当今世界潮流，更何况本属同一民族、同一国家的两岸人民，更应该进行对话和交流。海峡两岸虽然一度隔绝四十年，但是同宗同文的两岸同胞，从未断却骨肉亲情。聚合、统一是任何外来势力永远无法阻挡的。为了使祖国更快地繁荣富强，海峡两岸应该互相交流，互补互益，增进了解，增加共识。希望台湾当局以民族和国家大义为重，共同推进两岸交往的良好势头，为祖国和平统一大业作出贡献。
