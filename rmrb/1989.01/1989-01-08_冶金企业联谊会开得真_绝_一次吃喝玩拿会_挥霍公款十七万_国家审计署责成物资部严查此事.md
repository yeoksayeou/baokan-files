The Metallurgical Enterprise Friendship Conference Was Truly "Unique"
An Eating, Drinking, Playing, and Taking Conference
Wasting Public Funds of 170,000 Yuan
The State Audit Office Orders the Ministry of Materials to Severely Investigate This Matter

Reported by our newspaper: Recently, the State Audit Office's Special Representative Office in Shanghai discovered that the China Metallic Materials Company's Huadong First-Level Station and other units under the Ministry of Materials held the "National Partial Metallurgical Enterprise Friendship Conference" in Zhangjiagang, Jiangsu Province, in mid-July last year. The conference extravagantly wasted public funds, earning the ridicule of the public as an "eating, drinking, playing, and taking conference," causing a very bad influence.

This conference had 60-plus representatives, including staff members, and in the 4-day conference period, the expenditure amounted to over 170,000 yuan, with an average of over 700 yuan per person per day, plus gifts valued at over 800 yuan per person.

First, there was the "eating." During the conference, the average cost for dinner was 300-400 yuan per table. With welcoming and sending-off banquets, over 10 tables were set up, each costing over 800 yuan. During the conference, nearly 10,000 kilograms of watermelon, 75 kilograms of tea, 2,600 cans of cola, over 300 cartons of high-grade cigarettes, and other snacks like sunflower seeds and chewing gum were consumed. The total amount spent on eating and drinking was 92,000 yuan.

Second, there was the "enjoyment." The conference rented high-standard rooms at the Shazhou Hotel, with some double and triple rooms occupied by only one person. The accommodation fee amounted to 16,000 yuan, with an average of 60-70 yuan per person per day.

Third, there was the "playing." The conference organized a special song and dance evening, inviting amateur singers and a band from Zhangjiagang City. During the conference, the hotel continuously broadcasted closed-circuit television programs from 8 AM to midnight, with service staff on duty 24 hours a day to ensure immediate service. The conference also rented 10 "Crown" sedans and two "Hino" luxury tour buses from Shanghai Wuzhong Automobile Company for pick-up, drop-off, and sightseeing, spending 14,000 yuan on rentals, with an average of over 200 yuan per person.

Fourth, there was the "taking." The organizing units competed to give gifts, covering clothing, food, and daily necessities. The metallurgical materials company in the conference's host city gave each representative a carton of imported cigarettes, 12 cans of pull-tab beverages, a high-grade password lock briefcase, and 2 bathrobes. The Shangrao County Materials Bureau sent "Phoenix 205" cameras, pocket radios, electronic watches, and imported electric shavers from thousands of miles away by special car, giving one to each representative. The Putuo County Metallurgical Materials Company also brought local specialties such as dried squid, shrimp kernels, and laver, giving them to the representatives. The three organizing units gave each representative gifts valued at around 800 yuan. After the conference, they specially went to Shanghai to give gifts to the 7 people from the Huadong First-Level Station Market Department who did not attend the conference.

It is understood that the funds for this conference mainly came from squeezing costs and levying on enterprises. The Zhangjiagang City Metallurgical Materials Company directly included 155,000 yuan in the cost, listed in the management fee. A deputy manager of the company, with just a blank receipt, withdrew 1,970 yuan in cash from a township enterprise as a tip for the taxi driver.

This conference was organized by the Huadong First-Level Station of the China Metallic Materials Company under the Ministry of Materials, in cooperation with the Zhangjiagang City Metallurgical Materials Company in Jiangsu Province, the Shangrao County Materials Bureau in Jiangxi Province, and the Putuo County Metallurgical Materials Company in Zhejiang Province.

Extravagantly wasting national resources, leading normal economic exchanges astray, and causing a very bad influence among the public. The State Audit Office has now ordered the Ministry of Materials to seriously investigate and handle this case.

　　冶金企业联谊会开得真“绝”
  　一次吃喝玩拿会　挥霍公款十七万
    国家审计署责成物资部严查此事
    本报讯  最近，国家审计署驻上海特派员办事处检查发现，物资部中国金属材料公司所属华东一级站等单位，于去年７月中旬在江苏张家港市召开的“全国部分冶金企业联谊会”，大肆挥霍公款，被群众讥讽为“吃喝玩拿会”，造成了极坏的影响。
    这次会议的代表包括工作人员６０余人，在４天会期中，花费竟达１７万余元，平均每人每天花费７００多元，另加送礼品每人８００多元。
    一是“吃”。会议中晚餐每桌平均三四百元，一迎一送，又各设宴１０多桌，每桌开支８００多元。会议期间挥霍西瓜近１万公斤，茶叶７５公斤，可乐饮料２６００听，高级香烟３００多条，还有瓜子、口香糖等总共用于吃喝的金额高达９．２万元。
    二是“享受”。包租沙洲宾馆高标准客房，部分双人房、三人房只住一人，花费住宿费１．６万元，每天人均六七十元。
    三是“玩”。会议举办了专场歌舞晚会，请来张家港市业余歌手和乐队演奏。会议期间，宾馆每天从早上８时到晚上１２时，连续不停播放闭路电视节目，服务员昼夜２４小时值班，保证随叫随到。会议还向上海吴中汽车公司包租了１０辆“皇冠”小轿车和两辆“日野”豪华旅行车，接送代表和参观游览租车花去１．４万元，人均２００余元。
    四是“拿”。会议举办单位争相送礼，吃穿用的都有。会议所在市的金属材料公司给代表每人送了一条进口香烟，１２听易拉罐饮料，一只高级密码锁手提箱，２件毛巾浴袍。上饶县物资局不远千里，用专车送来“凤凰２０５型照相机”、袖珍放音机、电子手表和进口电动剃须刀，给代表人手一份。普陀县金属材料公司也带来了当地土特产品鱿鱼干、虾米仁、紫菜，送给各位代表。三家举办单位送给每位代表礼品价值人均８００元左右。会后，还专程去上海给未到会的华东一级站市场科的７人每人送去一份礼品。
    据了解，这个会议的经费来源主要是乱挤成本费用和向企业摊派。张家港市金属材料公司将１５．５万元直接计入成本费用，在管理费中列支。该公司一位副经理，仅凭一张白条，从一家乡镇企业支取现金１９７０元，作为小费送给了出租汽车司机。
    这个会议是由物资部所属中国金属材料公司华东一级站牵头，会同江苏省张家港市金属材料公司，江西上饶县物资局，浙江省普陀县金属材料公司联合举办的。
    大肆挥霍国家资财，将正常的经济交往引向歧途，在群众中造成了极坏的影响。国家审计署现已要求物资部严肃查处这一案件。
