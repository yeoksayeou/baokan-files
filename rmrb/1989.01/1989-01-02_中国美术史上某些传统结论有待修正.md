Early Chinese scroll paintings emphasized detailed depiction, and meticulous brushwork became the aesthetic standard of the imperial court, greatly influencing the entire society. Historians say that it was only with Wen Tong and Su Shi that the trend was reversed, advocating a freehand painting style in opposition to court art.

The freehand painting style first appeared in the Tang Dynasty's Tongguan Kiln porcelain paintings; the Song Dynasty's Cizhou Kiln further developed this style to a mature height. Long before Wen Tong and Su Shi, folk artists of the Cizhou Kiln had already established their own standards, opposing the court with a different aesthetic. The Gansu Provincial Museum has a porcelain pillow that provides favorable evidence for discussion. The pillow is inscribed with "Made in the first year of Mingdao, the eighth month, by Qingshan Dao Ren, drunk and painted at Shanyang." The first year of Mingdao in the Song Dynasty was 1032 AD. That year, Wen Tong was only 14 years old, and Su Shi was born five years later. This inscription is a very important key to studying Chinese art history. The bamboo painted on the pillow with ink (material) is more sparse than Wen Tong's, and it is genuinely freehand. Historians believe that the unoutlined ink bamboo began with Wen Tong and Su Shi, calling this their "significant innovation." In fact, long before them, the artisans of the Cizhou Kiln had already "innovated" and popularized this style in society. The credit for this innovation belongs to folk artists; Qingshan Dao Ren and others were the pioneers.

Moreover, there are many freehand flower and bird paintings from the Tang Dynasty's Tongguan Kiln porcelain paintings; the integration of calligraphy brushwork into painting began with the Tongguan Kiln porcelain paintings; the freehand painting style also first appeared in folk porcelain paintings. By comparing some art history writings with porcelain artifacts, it is found that many of the conclusions in the writings differ significantly from historical facts. It is felt that some widely accepted traditional conclusions need to be revised or rewritten.

　　中国美术史上某些传统结论有待修正
    中国早期卷轴画讲究细节描写，工笔画法成为皇家的审美标准，并极大影响着整个社会。史家们说只有到文同、苏轼才一反常规，提倡与院画相对立的写意画法。
    唐代铜官窑瓷绘的写意画风初见倪端；宋代磁州窑则把写意画风推到了一个成熟的高度。早在文同、苏轼之前，磁州窑的民间画家们已经另立“中央”，以另一种审美标准与宫廷唱对台戏，画起写意画了。甘肃博物馆有个瓷枕，对讨论可提供有利的论据。枕面写着“明道元年巧月造青山道人醉笔于沙阳”。宋代明道元年即公元一千零三十二年。该年文同才十四岁，苏轼五年后才出生。这个纪年款可说是研究中国美术史一把非常重要的钥匙。枕上的墨（料）竹，比文同的疏简多了，是地道的写意。史家认为不加勾勒的墨竹始自文同、苏轼，说这是他们的“一个较大的革新”，事实上，早在他们之前磁州窑的画工就已经“革新”并普及到社会上了。这创始之功在民间艺术家，青山道人他们才是先驱者。
    此外，唐铜官窑瓷绘中有大量写意花鸟传世；溶书法笔意入绘画早自铜官窑瓷绘开始；大写意画法也始见于民间瓷绘。将一些美术史著述和瓷绘实物对照，发现不少著述中的论断与史实出入较大，感到对某些公认的传统结论，有必要进行修正或重新改写。
