Zhuozhou City in Hebei Province has been focusing on investigating and punishing party members and officials who violate laws and regulations. Over the past two years, all 39 cases involving party members and officials have been concluded, with 41 individuals receiving disciplinary or administrative penalties, 28 being arrested, and 2.43 million yuan in illicit gains being recovered.

In the past, Zhuozhou City's efforts to "strictly govern the party" often relied on education and criticism, which drew significant criticism from the public, who felt it was more like "lenient governance." In recent years, the city has strictly enforced party and administrative discipline. Those who should be removed from their posts are immediately dismissed, and those who should be promoted are promptly advanced. The city's efforts to reward good behavior and punish wrongdoing have been effective. For example, a deputy director of the Municipal Bureau of Industry and Commerce was removed from his post and given a serious party warning for using his authority to arbitrarily revoke the business license of a restaurant, causing a negative impact on society.

From the outset of rectifying economic order and improving the economic environment, leaders from the party, government, and legal departments made it clear that they would first investigate cases of lawlessness and disorder among party and government leaders, believing that a "top-down" approach would demonstrate the party's resolve and hope in combating corruption. The former director of the Municipal Bureau of Prices, Mr. Gong, used the pretext of providing information to sell cars and defrauded a store in Chengdu of 530,000 yuan for color televisions, embezzling over 6,000 yuan in public funds. Despite having over 30 years of party membership and serving as a mid-level leader for 25 years, the Municipal Party Committee and Municipal Government showed no mercy, dispatching personnel to investigate in 15 provinces, cities, and counties. After clarifying the facts, the Municipal Party Committee decided to expel him from the party and handed the case over to the legal authorities. Gong was sentenced to 20 years in prison.

　　涿州市反腐败注重“自上而下”    
    两年来涉及党员干部的案件全部结案
    本报讯  河北省涿州市委反腐败现象注重查处违法乱纪的党员干部，两年多来，涉及党员干部的３９件案件已全部结案，４１人受到党纪或政纪处分，２８人被依法逮捕，２４３万元赃款被追回。
    涿州市过去“从严治党”常常“以教育、批评”为主，群众意见很大，认为实际上是“从宽治党”。近年来，该市严格党纪政纪处理，该撤的立即撤，该提的立即提，惩恶扬善。市工商局有个副局长利用职权，以所谓服务态度不好为由，强行掉销隆源酒家的营业执照，在社会上造成很坏影响，市政府和市委给他免职和党内严重警告处分。
    整顿经济秩序、治理经济环境一开始，党、政、法等部门的领导就明确思想：先查处党员领导干部中的违法乱纪案件，“自上而下”才能使群众看到党开展反腐败现象的决心和希望。原物价局长宫某以提供信息为由，倒卖汽车，诈骗成都华兴商店彩电款５３万元，贪污公款６０００多元。该人有３０多年党龄，担任中层领导干部２５年之久，市委、市政府心不慈、手不软，先后派员外调１５个省、市、市，终于查清事实，市委对他作出开除党籍的决定后，将此案移交法制部门。宫某被依法判处有期徒刑２０年。　　　　　　（成福　霍林　王渊）
