The first modern highway in China connecting the eastern, central, and northwestern regions—the eastern section of National Highway 312—has recently completed its first-phase main construction project.

The national highway project, which starts in Shanghai and ends in Yining, Xinjiang, is a key transportation construction project during the "Seventh Five-Year Plan" period. The entire route will be built in phases. The first phase of the eastern section, from Xige to Hefei, has been the first to commence construction. Located in Anhui Province, this section is 110 kilometers long with a total investment of 338 million yuan. The entire route is designed according to the standards of a first-class highway, with separate lanes for incoming and outgoing traffic and overpasses at intersections. The units responsible for this project, including the 16th and 4th Engineering Bureaus of the Ministry of Railways and the Second Bureau of the Ministry of Communications, have completed the main construction tasks after more than a year of hard work.
