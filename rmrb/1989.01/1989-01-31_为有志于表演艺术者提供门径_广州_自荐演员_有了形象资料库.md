For those aspiring to a career in performing arts but lacking opportunities, the Guangdong Nan Hua Cultural Service Company in Guangzhou has launched a unique service: the "Self-Recommended Actors Image Database." This database is designed to help individuals interested in film, television, and various performing arts find their way into the industry, while also providing convenience for performing arts groups in their search for talent.

Originally engaged in photography and videography, the Guangdong Nan Hua Cultural Service Company added this new service upon the suggestion of the performing arts community. The self-recommended actors' database covers a wide range of performing arts, including film and television projects, theater, traditional Chinese opera, dance, music, acrobatics, magic, radio broadcasting, and fashion modeling. The company registers relevant artistic information for those who come to apply and store their "image data" in the database, categorizing and numbering them for easy access.

　　为有志于表演艺术者提供门径    
    广州“自荐演员”有了形象资料库
    据新华社广州１月３０日电（记者陈婉雯）开设在广州市中山四路的广东南华文化服务公司，最近开办了一项别开生面的业务——“自荐演员形象资料库”，这是为有志于电影、电视及各类表演艺术事业而又苦于没有门路的人设立的，同时也为表演艺术团体物色演员提供了方便。
    广东南华文化服务公司原是经营摄影、录像业务的，经表演艺术界建议才增开了这项业务。自荐演员除影视项目外，还包括戏剧、曲艺、舞蹈、音乐、杂技、魔术、广播、时装模特等项目。公司为前来报名存放“形象资料”的自荐演员登记有关艺术资料，并分类编号，存入资料库。
