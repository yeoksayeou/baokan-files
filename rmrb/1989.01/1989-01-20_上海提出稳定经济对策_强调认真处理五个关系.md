Shanghai Proposes Economic Stabilization Measures
Emphasizes the Need to Properly Handle Five Relationships

	The People's Daily, Shanghai, January 19 – Reporter Zhang Shihong reports: At a recent meeting of party members and cadres across the city, Jiang Zemin, a member of the Political Bureau of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China and Secretary of the Shanghai Municipal Committee, pointed out that to earnestly implement the spirit of the Third Plenary Session of the 13th Central Committee, stabilize Shanghai's economy, and handle the following five relationships properly at present.

	First, handle the relationship between local interests and overall interests, and adhere to the principle of local interests subordinating to overall interests. Jiang Zemin said, from Shanghai's situation, everyone agrees with the policy of rectification and adjustment, but when it comes to specific projects, some comrades might say, "the economy is overheating, but 'you are hot, I am not.'" If everyone does not admit to overheating, then where does the overall economic overheating come from? Some emphasize that "one-size-fits-all" should not be used, but Comrade Li Peng has made it clear: differentiation should be made, and "one-size-fits-all" should not be used, but it can only be done on the premise of "cutting once." To do a good job in adjustment, it is inevitable to touch the existing interest distribution pattern, and some local interests need to make some necessary concessions, even suffer some losses. He said that the cleanup of buildings and halls should continue to be a key project for the whole city. Technical renovation projects for production should also be carefully cleaned up and strictly screened. For projects under construction that meet the direction of industrial adjustment and have good benefits, a batch should be preserved; for projects with no market for products and unmatched production and construction conditions, they should be resolutely cut.

	Second, handle the relationship between appropriately reducing the industrial growth rate and preventing economic stagflation. The Municipal Party Committee and Municipal Government, based on Shanghai's actual situation and after careful discussion, set Shanghai's industrial production growth rate for this year at 5% (excluding village-run industries is 4%). Last year, Shanghai's industrial development speed was 10% (excluding village-run industries is 8%). This is in line with the spirit of curbing economic overheating and is the minimum speed required to complete the task of contracting with the central government's finance. Shanghai has the ability and a lot of potential to tap into, but the most important thing is to improve economic efficiency. Each enterprise should aim at the advanced level of the same industry at home and abroad, conduct comparisons, find gaps, and strive to catch up, especially the economic growth of large and medium-sized state-owned enterprises should have a breakthrough.

	Third, handle the relationship between curbing demand and ensuring effective supply, stabilize market supply, and ensure the lives of citizens. He emphasized that the increase in effective supply mentioned here refers to the increase in important agricultural and sideline products such as grain, oil, meat, poultry, and eggs, daily necessities for people's lives, energy and short-line raw materials, popular and suitable light textile products, and commodities that are in short supply and have a high currency circulation rate, but not the general increase in the production of all products. The Municipal Party Committee requires all levels of party organizations to mobilize the strength of the whole city to continue to do a good job in agricultural production and the "vegetable basket" project, strive to have a good harvest in suburban agriculture next year, maintain the basic stability of vegetable prices, and ensure the supply of 26 kinds of daily necessities for people's lives.

	Fourth, handle the relationship between strengthening macro-control and insisting on micro-activation, deepen enterprise reform, and enhance the vitality of large and medium-sized state-owned enterprises. Jiang Zemin pointed out that strengthening and improving macro-control does not mean to manage enterprises to death again, but to realize active and orderly while continuing to insist on micro-activation. At the same time, insisting on micro-activation and opening up large and medium-sized state-owned enterprises is the key to the effectiveness of the state's macro-control. This year's enterprise reform, on the one hand, various bureaus and offices should delegate the responsibility, authority, and benefits to the enterprises, so that the enterprises can truly walk on the road of self-balancing profits and losses; on the other hand, implement the factory director bidding system, push capable people to be factory directors, and give factory directors sufficient autonomy in the internal matching reform of the enterprise. At the same time, promote the combination and merger of enterprises, and actively and steadily carry out the pilot work of the shareholding system with public ownership as the main body.

	Fifth, handle the relationship between continuing to overcome egalitarianism and resolutely studying and solving the problem of unfair social distribution, and strengthen the supervision and management of individual businesses. He pointed out that it is time to resolutely study and solve this problem. Because this problem has had and is having a serious impact and centrifugal force on the main force of the working class, the allied forces of farmers, the broad masses of intellectuals, and various social strata who rely on wages for their livelihood, which is not conducive to stabilizing people's minds and uniting people's hearts. The Municipal Government plans to study and solve this problem from six aspects, which are: strengthening the management of enterprises' self-operated tertiary industry and horizontal joint-venture income; strengthening the management of "four technologies" income of technical transfer, technical consultation, technical service, and technical training; strengthening the management of personal income; strengthening the management of workers engaging in second jobs and re-employment of retirees; strengthening the management of individual economy; strengthening the management of newly established "companies." Among the management of these six aspects, it is particularly important to strengthen the supervision and management of individual businesses and strengthen the control and management of the total wage of various newly established "companies." According to the survey, most of the individual businesses that have recently made a fortune mainly take the "shortcut" of illegal operation and serious tax evasion, and they also collude with some people in state-owned and collective enterprises who have the power to distribute product raw materials, exploit the loopholes in the current policy, and have a serious corrupting effect on our cadre team. After research by the Standing Committee of the Municipal Party Committee, it is believed that it is necessary to mobilize the strength of all sectors of society to comprehensively manage this problem. At the same time, it is necessary to combine the cleanup of companies and strengthen the management and control of the total wage of various companies. This work involves a wide range and is policy-oriented, but if done well, the impact will be great.

　　上海提出稳定经济对策
    强调认真处理五个关系
    本报上海１月１９日电  记者章世鸿报道：中共中央政治局委员、上海市委书记江泽民最近在全市党员干部会议上指出，认真贯彻十三届三中全会精神，稳定上海经济，当前必须认真处理好五个关系。
    第一，要处理好局部利益同整体利益的关系，坚持局部服从全局原则。江泽民说，从上海的情况看，大家对治理、整顿的方针都是赞成的，但一联系到具体项目，有些同志恐怕就会说，经济是过热，但“你热我不热”。如果大家都不承认过热，那全局的经济过热又是从哪里来的呢？也有的强调不能“一刀切”，但李鹏同志说得很明确：是要区别对待，不搞“一刀切”，但只能在“切一刀”的前提下来进行。要搞好调整，势必要触及现有的利益分配格局，有一些局部利益需要作一些必要的让步，甚至受一点损失。他说，要继续把清理楼堂馆所作为全市的重点。对生产性的技术改造项目也要认真清理，严格筛选。对在建项目中符合产业调整方向、效益好的要保一批；对产品无市场、生产条件和建设条件都不配套的，要下决心砍。
    第二，要处理好适当降低工业增长速度与防止出现经济滞胀的关系。市委、市府从上海实际出发，经过慎重讨论，把今年上海工业生产的增长速度定为５％（不包括村办工业是４％），去年上海的工业发展速度是１０％（不包括村办工业是８％），这是符合压缩经济过热精神的，也是完成向中央财政承包任务所要求的最起码速度。上海有这个能力，有不少潜力可以挖掘，最重要的是把经济效益搞上去。各个企业要瞄准同行业的国际、国内先进水平，进行对比，找出差距，发奋赶超，特别是全民所有制大中型企业的经济增长要有所突破。
    第三，要处理好压缩需求与保证有效供给的关系，稳定市场供应，安定市民生活。他强调指出，这里所说的增加有效供给，是指增加粮油肉禽蛋等重要农副产品，人民生活必需的日用工业品，能源和短线原材料，适销对路的轻纺产品和回笼货币多的紧俏商品，而决不是笼统地增加所有产品的生产。市委要求各级党组织动员全市力量继续抓好农业生产和“菜篮子”工程，力争明年郊区农业有一个好收成，保持菜价基本稳定，同时要确保２６种人民生活必需品的供应。
    第四，要处理好加强宏观控制与坚持微观搞活的关系，深化企业改革，增强全民所有制大中型企业的活力。江泽民指出，加强和改善宏观调控，并不是要把企业重新管死，而是要在继续坚持微观搞活的同时，努力实现活而有序。同时，坚持微观搞活，放开大中型国营企业，国家的宏观调控才能更加奏效。今年企业改革，一方面，各委办局要把责、权、利配套下放到企业去，使企业真正走上自负盈亏的道路；另一方面，实行厂长招标，把能人推出来当厂长，让厂长在企业内部进行配套改革中有充分的自主权。同时，要推动企业之间联合、兼并，还要积极稳妥地进行以公有制为主体的股份制试点。
    第五，要处理好继续克服平均主义与下决心研究解决社会分配不公的关系，加强对个体户的监督、管理。他指出，现在是到了下决心研究解决这个问题的时候了。因为这个问题已经和正在对工人阶级主力军队伍、对农民同盟军队伍、对广大知识分子、对以工薪维持生活的社会各阶层产生了严重的冲击作用和离心作用，不利于稳定人心和凝聚人心。市府准备从六个方面来研究解决这个问题，这就是加强对企业自办第三产业和横向联营收入的管理；加强对技术转让、技术咨询、技术服务、技术培训这“四技”收入的管理；加强对个人收入的管理；加强对职工从事第二职业和离休人员再就业的管理；加强对个体经济的管理；加强对新办“公司”的管理。在这六个方面的管理中，尤为重要的是加强对个体户的监督管理和加强对各类新办“公司”工资总额的控制和管理。从调查的情况看，近期多数经济暴发的个体户，主要走的是非法经营和严重偷漏税的“捷径”，他们还与某些国营、集体企业手中握有产品原料批发权的人相勾结，钻现有政策的空子，对于我们的干部队伍起了严重的腐蚀作用。经市委常委研究，认为应当动员社会各方面力量，综合治理这一问题。同时还要结合清理公司，加强对各类公司工资总额的管理和控制。这项工作，涉及面很广，政策性很强，但搞好了影响面也很大。
