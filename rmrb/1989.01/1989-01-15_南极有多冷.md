	The "Jidihao" (极地号) research vessel, sent by China to the Antarctic to establish the Zhongshan Station, has currently arrived at its anchorage but has not yet landed on the Antarctic continent. The Antarctic is known for its extremely cold climate and is often referred to as the "bottom of the world." But just how cold is the Antarctic?

	Let's start with a sensory understanding!

	If you touch cold metal with a wet hand, your hand will stick to it. You will need to urinate on the metal to raise its temperature and save your hand. If both hands are stuck, you will need to ask a friend for help to free yourself.

	When handling containers of gasoline, kerosene, or other chemical liquids, be extra careful, as contact with these liquids can cause frostbite.

	Do not wear both shoes and boots at the same time, as this will impede blood circulation and cause your legs to freeze and die if you are immobilized and cannot walk.

	If you fall into icy water, you must keep moving. Your clothes can help you float, so do not take them off. If you can crawl onto the ice but do not receive immediate assistance, you must stand and keep moving; otherwise, you will freeze quickly.

	Due to the vast area of the Antarctic continent, its low latitude, and high altitude, especially in the inland highlands south of 70 degrees latitude, where the altitude exceeds 3,000 meters, the temperature is the lowest, with an annual average temperature not higher than -55 degrees Celsius. The highest temperature there does not exceed -15 degrees Celsius, making it the "cold pole" of the world.

	The lowest temperature recorded in the Antarctic to date was -88.3 degrees Celsius, measured by the Soviet Union's Vostok Station on August 24, 1980. The station is located at an altitude of 3,488 meters, which is 701 meters higher than the South Pole.

	The tip of the Antarctic Peninsula, located north of the Antarctic Circle, has an average temperature of around -5 degrees Celsius, making it known as the "warm belt" of the Antarctic continent.

　　南极有多冷
    夏之秋
    我国赴南极考察、建立中山站的“极地”号考察船，目前已抵达锚地，但尚未在南极大陆登陆。南极因气候寒冷，素有“世界之底”的称呼。那么，南极到底有多冷呢？
    先来点感性认识吧！
    用潮湿的光手去摸冷金属，会把手粘上。必须在该金属上撒泡尿，提高金属的温度来挽救你的手。如果两手都粘上了，只能请朋友来帮忙解脱。
    手拿汽油、煤油或其它化学液体容器时要特别注意，因为一旦触及这些液体，就会造成冻伤。
    不要既穿鞋，又套靴，这样，你会在被困而获救的情况下失去下肢的，因为它妨碍血液循环，在无法行走时使腿受冻坏死。
    如果掉入冰水中，必须保持活动，服装可以助浮，一定不要把它脱掉。如果能够爬上冰面，又得不到立即的援助时，一定要站立着，保持运动，不然很快就会冻僵。
    由于南极大陆面积大，纬度低和地势高，尤其在南纬七十度以内的内陆高原，海拔超过三千米的地方，气温最低，年平均温度不高于负五十五摄氏度，那里的最高温度不超过负十五摄氏度，可以说是世界上的“冷极”。
    目前所知南极最低温度的读数是一九八○年八月二十四日苏联东方高原记录站测得的，为负八十八点三摄氏度。该站海拔三千四百八十八米，高出南极极点达七百零一米。
    南极半岛的最末端，位于南极圈以北，那里的平均温度是负五摄氏度左右，所以被称之为南极大陆的“温热带”。
