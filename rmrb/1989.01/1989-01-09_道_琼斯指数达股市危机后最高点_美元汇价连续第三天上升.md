    The Dow Jones Industrial Average in the New York stock market rose for three consecutive days and closed at 2,194.29 points today, the highest level since the market crisis on October 19, 1987.

    During this week, the Dow Jones Industrial Average rose by 25.72 points. Market analysts believe that although the employment situation in the United States is continuously improving, recent wage growth has not been significant, with last month's increase being only 0.2%. This has eased market concerns about the possibility of the Federal Reserve raising the discount rate, which would have an adverse effect on the stock market.

    The New York foreign exchange market saw the dollar continue to rise against other major Western currencies for the third consecutive day.

    At the close of trading today in the New York foreign exchange market, the dollar's exchange rate against the West German Mark rose from yesterday's 1:1.7985 to 1:1.8165; against the yen, it rose from 1:125.975 to 1:126.75. The exchange rates against the British pound, Swiss franc, and French franc also rose. In other major foreign exchange markets such as London and Tokyo, the dollar showed a similar trend.

　　道—琼斯指数达股市危机后最高点
    美元汇价连续第三天上升
    新华社纽约１月６日电  纽约股票市场道—琼斯３０种工业股票的平均指数在连续３天上升之后，在今天收盘时达到２１９４．２９点，为１９８７年１０月１９日股市危机以来的最高水平。
    在本周里，道—琼斯３０种工业股票的平均指数共上升了２５．７２点。市场分析家们认为，尽管美国就业形势不断改善，但近来工资增长幅度并不大，上月份仅为０．２％。这就缓和了市场对联邦储备委员会提高贴现率的可能性的担心，而贴现率的提高将对股票市场产生不利影响。
    新华社纽约１月６日电　美元对西方其他主要货币的比价今天继续上升。迄今为止，这种势头已持续了３天。
    在纽约外汇市场今天下午收盘时，美元对西德马克的比价由昨天的１∶１．７９８５上升到１∶１．８１６５；对日元的比价由１∶１２５．９７５升至１∶１２６．７５；对英镑、瑞士法郎和法国法郎等货币的比价也均有所上升。在伦敦、东京等其他主要外汇市场上，美元汇价也呈现出同样的走势。
