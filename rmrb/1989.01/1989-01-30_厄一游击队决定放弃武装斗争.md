Ecuador's Interior Minister Andres Vallejo announced on the 26th that the "Alfarro Vive" guerrilla organization in Ecuador has decided to abandon armed struggle and participate in the country's normal and legal life.

Vallejo made the announcement after multiple rounds of negotiations between government representatives and guerrilla leaders, during which both sides reached an agreement. A government statement said the agreement conforms to the government's spirit of "exerting all efforts to restore peace and consolidate harmony among the Ecuadorian people." The statement said the government welcomes the "Alfarro Vive" guerrilla group's decision to lay down their arms, end their underground activities, and participate in the country's political life.

The "Alfarro Vive" guerrilla group has been active since early 1983. It uses the statue and sword of Ecuadorian national hero General Alfaro as its symbol. Since 1984, its anti-government activities in cities have intensified. After the Borja government took office last year, it began negotiations with the guerrilla organization to achieve domestic peace.

　　厄一游击队决定放弃武装斗争
    据新华社基多１月２７日电  厄瓜多尔内政部长安德烈斯·巴列霍２６日宣布，厄瓜多尔“阿尔法罗永生”游击队组织已决定放弃武装斗争，参加到国家正常、合法的生活中来。
    巴列霍是在政府代表与游击队领导人进行了多次谈判、双方达成协议后作出上述宣布的。政府发表的一份公报说，双方协议符合政府“要竭尽全力恢复和平与巩固厄瓜多尔人民之间的和睦”精神。公报说，政府欢迎“阿尔法罗永生”游击队放下武器，结束地下活动，参加到国家政治生活中来。
    “阿尔法罗永生”游击队自１９８３年初开始活动，它以厄瓜多尔民族英雄阿尔法罗将军的雕像和佩剑作为象征，１９８４年以来，其在城市的反政府活动得到加强。博尔哈政府去年上台后，为实现国内和平而与该游击队组织开始了谈判。
