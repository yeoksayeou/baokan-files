A West German nuclear power plant, Neckarwestheim 2, began generating electricity and connecting to the grid today.

The power plant has a generating capacity of 1,300 megawatts. It took five years to build and cost 5 billion marks. According to the plant's management, after starting operations, the plant will initially run at 30% of its capacity. Three weeks later, it will gradually reach its full capacity.

The plant was constructed by a consortium led by Siemens, with major shareholders including Neckar Power Plant, Stuttgart Technical Factory, Swabian Energy Supply Company, and the West German Federal Railway.

Including Neckarwestheim 2, West Germany currently has 24 nuclear power plants, of which 3 are experimental and research facilities.
