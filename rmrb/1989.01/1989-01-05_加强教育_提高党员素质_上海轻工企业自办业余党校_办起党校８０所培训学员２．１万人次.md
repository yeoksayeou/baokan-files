	Strengthen Education and Improve Party Members' Qualities
	Shanghai Light Industry Enterprises Establish 80 Evening Party Schools, Training 21,000 Participants

	Xinhua News Agency, Shanghai, January 4th - The Party Committee of the Shanghai Municipal Bureau of Light Industry has actively promoted the establishment of evening party schools within enterprises to strengthen the education of party members and improve their political qualities, achieving good results.

	The evening party school was first established by the Shanghai Glass Instrument Factory II in 1984. At that time, the factory aimed to change its backward image of poor party discipline by establishing an evening party school run by the factory's party branch. The school conducted training for party members according to the requirements of the new era, significantly improving the image of the party members. The Bureau's Party Committee promptly summarized and promoted their experience, leading to the rapid development of enterprise-run evening party schools across the bureau. So far, 154 enterprise party organizations have established 80 evening party schools, training a total of 21,000 participants.

	The evening party schools adhere to the principle of part-time education, using methods such as self-scheduled learning days, cross-course scheduling, and supplementary education to cater to individual needs and teach according to different levels. For those who wish to join the party, the focus is on educating them about the basic knowledge of the party; for older party members with lower education levels, systematic education on the party's line, principles, and policies is conducted through lectures and explanations of documents.

	Various enterprises have created many forms of evening party schools, including single-factory operations, joint operations by several small factories, and collaborative operations between factories and universities.

	Through the systematic education provided by the evening party schools, the development of both material and spiritual civilizations has been promoted. Statistics show that out of the more than 5,400 active members who have undergone training, 488 have joined the party.

　　加强教育　提高党员素质
    上海轻工企业自办业余党校
    办起党校８０所培训学员２．１万人次
    新华社上海１月４日电  （通讯员顾德源）上海市轻工业局党委积极推广企业自办业余党校，以加强对党员的教育，提高党员政治素质，取得较好效果。
    自办业余党校是上海玻璃器皿二厂于１９８４年首创的。当时，这家厂为改变党风较差的落后面貌，由厂党总支自办了一所业余党校，按新时期的要求对党员进行轮训，使党员面貌发生了很大变化。局党委及时总结推广了他们的经验，企业自办业余党校就在全局范围内迅速发展。到目前为止，这个局已有１５４个企业党组织办起了８０所业余党校，先后培训学员２．１万人次。
    业余党校坚持业余为主，采用学员自定学习日、交叉开课、缺啥补啥等办法，因人制宜，按层次施教。对要求入党的积极分子着重进行党的基础知识教育；对年龄大、文化较低的党员，采用讲解文件等形式进行党的路线、方针、政策的系统教育；
    各企业在办业余党校中创造了许多形式，有一厂独办的，有几个小厂联合办的，也有工厂和高校挂钩联办的。
    通过业余党校的系统教育，促进了两个文明建设的发展。据统计，在经过培训的５４００多名积极分子中，已有４８８人加入了党的队伍。
