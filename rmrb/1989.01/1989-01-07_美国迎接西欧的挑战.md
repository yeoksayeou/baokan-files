The internal European market will affect U.S. exports and investments, putting pressure on its current European trade policies. American companies are beginning to plan "European strategies," adjusting and consolidating their sales networks in Europe, enhancing the competitiveness of their products, and increasing their investments in Europe.

Our reporter Jing Xianfa reports from Washington: Recently, Rudolph, the director of the European Community Affairs Division at the U.S. Department of Commerce, gave an exclusive interview to our reporter on the issue of the internal European market. The following is a summary of the content:

Reporter: Why does the United States attach so much importance to the construction of the European market?

Rudolph: There are two reasons. First, the United States exports $90 billion worth of goods to the European Community each year. More importantly, U.S. transnational corporations sell $500 billion worth of goods within the Community annually. Therefore, the changes that will occur in Europe will affect U.S. exports and investments. Secondly, Western Europe's gross national product accounts for one-quarter of the world's total. The United States hopes to see an open economy in the future of Western Europe.

Reporter: Do you think the internal market is developing in a direction favorable to the United States?

Rudolph: From the current state of U.S.-European trade imbalance, this change seems to be developing in a direction favorable to the United States. However, in the next four years, European manufacturers and industry associations may believe that this change harms their interests and will try to rebuild trade protectionist barriers.

Reporter: Does the internal market pose a threat to the United States?

Rudolph: Yes. These threats mainly manifest in the pressure they put on the United States' current European trade policies, such as restrictions on textiles, household appliances, footwear and leather, semiconductor components, certain machine tools and electromechanical products, computer hardware and software, and financial services.

Reporter: If the development of the internal market is clearly unfavorable to the United States and U.S.-Western Europe negotiations fall into a stalemate, what measures will the United States take?

Rudolph: We are very concerned about this situation. If this situation arises, the United States will seek to expand cooperation with other major economic regions outside of Western Europe, including expanding cooperation with the Asia-Pacific economic region.

Reporter: Has the U.S. business community already prepared to face the challenge from Western Europe?

Rudolph: Yes. More and more American companies are planning specific "European strategies" to protect their interests from being harmed. On one hand, they are consolidating their sales networks and adjusting prices in the European market to retain European customers. On the other hand, they are competing directly with European products that are about to enter the U.S. market in terms of product design, weakening the competitiveness of European goods. In addition, U.S. companies are also preparing to significantly increase their investments in Europe, forcing European manufacturers to abandon some of their efforts to enter the U.S. market.

Reporter: After President-elect Bush takes office, what will be the first move regarding the internal market?

Rudolph: I think we should first strive to expand the scope of negotiations in the current Uruguay Round to include the service industry and intellectual property rights, and strive to make progress in eliminating agricultural subsidies. If we can achieve success in these areas, we can expand the negotiations to other areas, making the 1992 internal market truly beneficial for global trade.

Reporter: Thank you, Director.

Editor's Note:

The construction of the internal market within the European Community has sparked widespread reactions in the United States, Japan, and European countries. Our reporters stationed in the United States, Japan, and Sweden have interviewed relevant individuals and sent back reports. These reports can help us deepen our understanding of the European market from another perspective.

　　美国迎接西欧的挑战
    内容提要：欧洲内部大市场将对美国的出口和投资产生影响，使它现行的欧洲贸易政策受到压力，美国公司开始筹划“对欧战略”，调整、巩固在欧洲的销售网，提高商品的竞争力，追加对欧洲的投资。
    本报华盛顿电　记者景宪法报道：美国商务部欧洲共同体事务司司长鲁多尔斯最近就欧洲内部大市场问题接受了本报记者的独家采访，内容摘要如下：
    记者：美国为何如此重视欧洲大市场的建设？
    鲁多尔斯司长（以下简称鲁）：原因有二，一是因为美国每年向欧洲共同体出口９００亿美元的商品，更为重要的是，美国在欧洲的跨国公司每年在共同体内部销售５０００亿美元的货物。因此，欧洲即将发生的变化，对美国的出口和投资都将产生影响。其次，西欧的国民生产总值占世界总值的１／４强，美国希望看到未来的西欧经济是开放型经济。
    记者：您认为大市场正在向有利于美国的方向发展吗？
    鲁：从目前的美欧贸易失衡状况来看，这一变化似乎在朝有利于美国的方向发展。但是，在未来的４年里，欧洲的厂商和产业协会很可能会认为这一变化损害了他们的切身利益，因而设法重建贸易保护主义的壁垒。
    记者：大市场是否对美国构成了威胁？
    鲁：是的。这些威胁主要体现在对美国现行的欧洲贸易政策施加了压力，譬如在限制纺织品、家用电器、鞋类与制革、半导体元件、某些机床和机电产品、计算机硬软件以及金融服务等方面。
    记者：如果大市场的发展明显对美国不利，而美国同西欧的谈判又陷僵局，美国将如何采取措施？
    鲁：我们非常担心出现这一局面。万一形成这一局面，美国将谋求扩大同西欧以外的其它几大经济区域合作，其中包括扩大与亚太经济区域的合作。
    记者：美国企业界是否已经准备迎接西欧的挑战？
    鲁：是的。越来越多的美国公司开始筹划具体的“对欧战略”，以保护其利益不受损害。他们一方面在欧洲市场巩固销售网和调整价格以吸住欧洲客户，另一方面，他们在产品设计上同欧洲产商即将打入美国市场的产品直接竞争，削弱欧洲商品的竞争力。除此之外，美国企业还准备大量追加对欧洲的投资，迫使欧洲厂商放弃部分进取美国市场的努力。
    记者：当选总统布什入主白宫之后，对大市场将首先作出何种举动？
    鲁：我想我们首先应该在目前的乌拉圭回合中争取将谈判范围扩大到服务业和知识产权的领域中去，并争取在取缔农产品补贴方面获得进展。如果能在这些方面取得成绩，我们就能将谈判扩展到其它领域，使１９９２年的大市场真正有利于全球贸易。
    记者：谢谢司长先生。
