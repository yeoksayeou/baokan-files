Large-scale afforestation begins to show results. Wengyuan County in Guangdong Province has greened 1 million acres of barren mountains in 10 years.

A report from our newspaper states: Located in the northern mountains of Guangdong, Wengyuan County began concentrating funds to create artificial forests in 1979 while implementing large-scale afforestation. The once barren hills and mountains are now lush with greenery. The county's forest coverage has reached 64%, providing a shortcut for China's large-scale afforestation efforts.

Before the 1950s, Wengyuan County was known for its dense forests and scenic beauty. However, after the large-scale destruction of forest resources in 1958, the county was left with 1.39 million acres of barren mountains and sparse forests. Despite annual afforestation efforts, the survival rate of the planted trees was low, and the greening efforts could not keep up with the rate of forest depletion. By 1979, the county still had nearly 1 million acres of barren mountains.

The county committee and government addressed this issue by learning from historical experiences of afforestation, changing the previous method of relying solely on planting trees in pits, and adopting a policy of afforestation with a focus on afforestation and a combination of afforestation and management. They implemented large-scale afforestation in all 17 towns and townships, covering 1.5 million acres.

Over the past 10 years, although the county's afforestation area has decreased compared to previous years, the area with forests has significantly increased. According to surveys, the county's forest area has expanded from over 1.5 million acres in 1979 to 2.38 million acres, and the forest stock volume has increased from 39.9 million cubic meters to 52 million cubic meters.

Upon arriving in Wengyuan County, one can see afforestation slogans and agreements at road junctions, village entrances, and mountain foothills. Afforestation has become a well-known endeavor among all the county's residents, young and old.

According to Li Peiqiu, the county's party secretary, Wengyuan County's afforestation efforts have focused on three main strategies:

First, by establishing afforestation regulations and forming village rules and customs, the county has transformed "official governance" into "community governance," relying on thousands of households to protect the forests. Those who violate the agreements not only have their illegal gains confiscated but are also heavily fined. Over the past 10 years, 135 villages have successively established village rules and customs, gradually forming good forest protection habits.

Second, by promoting fuel-efficient stoves, the county has reduced the consumption of forest resources. All 381 brick, tile, and lime kilns in the county have switched from burning wood to burning coal and straw. The 2,000 households in the county seat have switched to using coal and gas for heating, and over 90% of rural households have adopted fuel-efficient stoves. This alone has reduced the annual felling of forests by nearly 50,000 cubic meters.

Third, by strengthening the forest protection team, the county has organized 230 professional forest protectors and 162 part-time protectors, ensuring the strict implementation of afforestation regulations.

The implementation of afforestation regulations has made forest management easier. The county has implemented logging quotas, reducing the annual forest consumption from 360,000 cubic meters to 168,000 cubic meters, with an annual net increase of 130,000 cubic meters in forest resources. The phenomena of illegal logging and tree branch cutting, which were previously difficult to control, have significantly decreased. The number of forest fires and the area of burned forests have also notably reduced.

After 10 years of afforestation, the economic benefits are substantial. Currently, the output value per acre of mountainous land in the county has increased from 1 yuan in 1979 to 20 yuan, and the forestry output value has risen from 2.48 million yuan to over 10 million yuan. Timber and dozens of forest by-products have become a significant source of income for farmers. According to the county's forestry bureau, the current value of the county's 52 million cubic meters of forests is 1 billion yuan. The mountains have become Wengyuan's greatest asset.

With the increase in forests, the ecological environment has significantly improved. Now, forests extend to the roadsides and village edges, and the river water is clear. A county leader introduced that during the dry season, the flow of the Wengjiang River has increased from 3 to 5 units, and grain production has seen a continuous 10-year harvest. In May last year, despite an unprecedented heavy rain, the county saw no disasters, in stark contrast to the 1964 flood that left 50,000 people homeless.

　　实行大规模封山育林初见效果
    翁源县十年绿化荒山百万亩
    本报讯  地处粤北山区的广东省翁源县，从１９７９年开始在集中资金大力营造人工林的同时，实行大规模封山育林。过去的一片片荒山秃岭，如今已是满目青山。全县森林覆盖率达到６４％，为我国开展大面积荒山绿化走出一条捷径。
    ５０年代以前，翁源县曾是森林茂密、山青水秀之地。自１９５８年森林资源遭到大破坏后，全县出现了１３９万亩荒山、残林。此后，他们虽然年年造林，但造得多，活的少，绿化速度一直跟不上森林消减的速度，直到１９７９年全县仍有近百万亩荒山。
    县委、县政府针对这一问题，借鉴历史上封山育林的经验，改变过去单纯依靠挖坑造林的办法，实行以封山育林为主，封管造相结合的营林方针，在全县１７个乡镇全面开展封山育林，封山面积达１５０万亩。
    近１０年，全县造林面积虽比过去减少，但有林地面积大幅度增加。据清查，全县森林面积已由１９７９年的１５０多万亩扩大到２3８万亩，森林蓄积量由３９９万立方米上升到５２０万立方米。
    来到翁源县，路口、村旁、山前，到处可见封山育林的宣传标语和公约。封山育林已成了全县男女老少无人不晓的事。
    据县委书记李培秋介绍，翁源县封山育林主要抓了三招：
    一是封山立禁，形成乡规民约，把“官治”变为“民治”，依靠千家万户护林。对违约者除了没收其非法所得外，从重罚款。１０年间，全县１３５个村相继制定有乡规民约，逐步形成了护林的好习惯。
    二是改燃节柴，堵住消耗森林的老虎灶。全县３８１个砖、瓦、石灰窑全部改烧柴为烧煤、草，县城２０００户居民烧上煤和煤气，农村９０％以上的农户用上节柴灶。仅此一项全县每年少砍森林近５万立方米。
    三是强化护林队伍，全县组织专业护林员２３０人，兼职护林员１６２人，保证了封山育林制度的严格执行。
    封山育林制度的推行使林政管理由难变易。全县落实了采伐限额，森林消耗量由过去的年３６万立方米下降到１６．８万立方米，森林资源年净增１３万立方米。过去禁而不止的乱砍滥伐、乱打树枝现象大大减少，森林火灾次数与烧山面积也明显下降。
    封山１０年，经济效益十分可观。如今，全县山地每亩产值由１９７９年的１元，增加到２０元，林业产值由过去的２４８万元，上升到１０００多万元。木材和数十种林副特产成了农民的一大财富，据县林业局测算，全县现有森林５２０万立方米，价值１０亿元。山林已经成了翁源的最大家当。
    随着森林的增长，生态环境大为改善。如今森林已延伸到路边、村旁，河水清澈见底。县里一位领导同志介绍，翁江河枯水期流量，由过去的３个上升到５个，粮食产量已连续１０年获得丰收。去年５月，一场罕见的暴雨，全县未见灾情，与１９６４年同样程度的水灾造成５万人无家可归的境地，形成鲜明对比。 　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　（高保生、封加平）
