The spirit of the South China Sea heroes, which is needed in the current reform, has stirred up a strong response from all sectors of society.

Covered in the smoke of battle, with unhealed wounds and dust from the frontlines, six tanned soldiers from the South China Sea have, since late September last year, been invited to give reports in various organizations, military units, schools, factories, and neighborhoods in Hainan, Guangdong, Guangxi, Hubei, Hebei, Beijing, and Tianjin, totaling over 60 sessions, with an audience of over 100,000 people.

The reporters of the South China Sea heroes' deeds are outstanding representatives of the first batch of builders and defenders of the Republic in the South China Sea. Since last spring, they and their comrades have built stations, guarded reefs, and patrolled the area, overcoming unimaginable difficulties and writing moving stories. They have demonstrated the spirit of selfless dedication and hard work of the people's army.

"The South China Sea spirit is what the current reform needs." The heroes' reports, like a refreshing breeze, opened the hearts of many people, prompting them to think: In this new era of reform and opening up, how can we, like the soldiers of the South China Sea, contribute to the country? Several young individual business owners in Guangzhou said after listening to the report, "In the past, we thought that operating according to regulations and paying taxes was enough dedication and patriotism. Now we feel we should have higher aspirations." Officials and residents of Beijing's Xuanwu District Repair Company and Niujie Street heard the report and believed it to be a very vivid lesson on the current situation. Teacher Liang Xinyi of Beijing No. 43 Middle School said, "While listening to the report, I cried several times, feeling that we are blessed but unaware of it. Compared to the soldiers of the South China Sea, I feel ashamed. We should, like the soldiers of the South China Sea, share the country's worries and participate in the reform with a sense of ownership."

The heroes' reports have built a bridge of understanding between the soldiers of the South China Sea and the youth on the mainland. When the reporting team gave talks in more than 20 colleges and universities in Guangzhou, every session was packed. The emotions of the teachers and students fluctuated with the report, and when they heard moving parts, many students shed tears of emotion; when they heard exciting parts, applause and laughter interrupted the report. After the report, the students always surrounded the soldiers, asking questions and not wanting to leave. A young woman revealed her heart, "In the past, I did not understand soldiers. After listening to the heroes' report, I want to reconsider my future life." Wang Zhixiong, a cadre of the Guangzhou Municipal Youth League Committee, excitedly said, "Initially, we had doubts about the effectiveness of the report meeting. Now it seems that the youth are inspired, and the deeds of the heroes are equally inspiring."

The deeds of the South China Sea soldiers have aroused people's patriotism and support for the military. Some colleges and universities in Guangdong and Guangxi have launched the activity "What can I do for the soldiers of the South China Sea?" Many students expressed their willingness to go to where the country needs them most, like the soldiers, to build and achieve. In recent days, letters and gifts of condolence from all over the country have been continuously sent to the South China Sea.

　　展示人民军队无私奉献艰苦创业精神
    南沙英模报告激起社会各界反响
    新华社北京１月１３日电  （记者李石元、曹国强）披着海战的硝烟，带着未愈的伤口和未洗尽的征尘，６位脸色黝黑的南沙将士从去年９月底至今，应邀为海南、广东、广西、湖北、河北、北京和天津等省市区的机关、部队、学校、工厂、街道作报告６０余场，听众达１０多万人次。
    南沙英模事迹的报告人，是共和国第一批南沙建设者和保卫者的优秀代表。去年春天以来，他们和战友们在那片神圣遥远的国土上，建站、守礁、巡逻，征服了难以想象的困难，谱写了可歌可泣的事迹，展示了人民军队无私奉献、艰苦创业的精神。
    “南沙精神，是当前改革所需要的。”英模报告像一股清新的春风，叩开了人们的心扉，引起了众多人的思考：在改革开放的新时期，怎样像南沙将士那样为祖国建功立业？广州市的几位个体户青年听了报告说，过去我们认为照章经营、依法纳税就是奉献、爱国。现在觉得应该有更高的追求。北京宣武区修理公司、牛街街道等单位和地区的干部群众听了报告，认为这是一次非常生动的形势教育。北京４３中学教师梁新彝说：“听着报告我好几次流了泪，感到我们是生在福中不知福，与南沙将士比，心里惭愧。我们应像南沙将士那样为国分忧，以主人翁的姿态投身改革。”
    英模报告在南沙将士与内地青年心中架起了理解的桥梁。报告团在广州２０多所大专院校作报告时，场场爆满。师生们的情绪随着报告情节起伏，听到感人处，不少同学流下热泪；听到兴奋处，掌声、笑声又把报告打断。报告结束，同学们总要把将士们团团围住嘘长问短，久久不愿离去。一位女青年坦露心声：“过去我不理解军人。听了英模报告，我要重新考虑今后的人生。”广州团市委干部王志雄激动地说：“起初我们对报告会的效果有过怀疑，现在看来，青年们被感召，同英模们的事迹一样使人振奋。”
    南沙将士的事迹唤起了人们的爱国拥军热情。广东、广西一些大专院校开展了“我为南沙将士做些什么”的活动，许多同学表示要像战士们那样听从祖国召唤，到祖国最需要的地方去建功立业。连日来，全国各地的慰问信和慰问品已源源不断地寄往南沙。
