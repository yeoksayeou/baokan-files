Supportive Policies Warm the Hearts
Farmers in Shuangcheng City Sell Surplus Grain in the Snow

BEIJING, Jan. 19 (Xinhua) — In the depths of winter, under heavy snowfall, the roads in Shuangcheng City, Heilongjiang Province, are filled with grain trucks, creating a bustling scene as farmers rush to sell their surplus grain to the state.

In recent years, since the county was renamed Shuangcheng City with a population of over 600,000 and 2.85 million mu of arable land, the city has seen an average annual increase of 180 million kilograms of grain. During the peak grain collection period, the daily purchase volume can fill a 10,000-ton ship. As of now, in just over a month, the city has sold 310 million kilograms of surplus grain to the state (enough to feed 1.6 million people for a year), exceeding the state procurement quota by 70%. Even now, the rural roads are still filled with grain trucks.

What has motivated the farmers to sell their grain so enthusiastically? It is the thorough support from the government.

In the past, farmers across the country complained about the high prices of commercial fertilizers. In contrast, Shuangcheng's fertilizers are relatively cheap. This is because Shuangcheng has blocked the "official" and "private" speculators from profiteering, ensuring that only the deputy mayor, Tan Zhongyi, has the authority to approve fertilizer purchases. No one else can issue vouchers. Farmers can buy state-allocated fertilizers directly from the city, which warms their hearts and encourages them to buy more and invest more.

To make the most of large agricultural machinery, Shuangcheng divides the land into responsibility fields and subsistence fields, with no overlap. For the majority of the land, which are responsibility fields, machinery is used to replace manual labor. Shuangcheng also increases investment in water conservancy projects, actively organizing farmers to dig canals, divert water, and build dikes. Based on the abundant water resources, the city rewards farmers for drilling wells and converting dry land to irrigated land. Over the past three years, 800 more wells have been drilled, increasing the yield per mu. Despite annual floods, the city has seen consecutive bountiful harvests.

Farmers generally agree that Shuangcheng's support for agriculture is excellent. Farmer Zhou Guining from Xingshan Village chose to sell all 65,000 kilograms of his surplus grain to the state, even though it meant earning 2,000 yuan less. He sincerely said, "The county's policies are good, and the services are thoughtful. I had a good harvest, and I can't let the country down. I must support the state."

### 扶持政策暖人心  双城市农民冒雪售余粮

　　扶持政策暖人心
    双城市农民冒雪售余粮
    本报讯  记者武培真报道：数九寒天，大雪弥漫，黑龙江双城市郊大小公路上粮车塞道，马嘶机鸣，呈现出向国家争先交售余粮的热闹场面。
    近期由县更名、拥有６０余万人口和２８５万亩耕地的双城市，三年来平均每年增产粮食１．８亿公斤。在交粮高峰，每天收购量可装一艘万吨轮。截至目前，仅一个多月，已向国家卖余粮３．１亿公斤（可供１６０万人吃一年），超额完成定购任务７０％，乡间道上送粮车仍络绎不绝。
    靠什么调动了农民交售粮食的积极性？靠周到的支农工作。
    前一时期各地农民都喊议价化肥贵，相对而言，双城的化肥却便宜，那是因为双城堵住了“官倒”、“私倒”从中间盘剥的路，确定了副市长谭中义“一支笔”，其它任何人不能批条子。农民从市（县）里直接买来国拨化肥，心里暖洋洋，自然多买多投入。
    为了发挥大型农机具的作用，双城把土地分成责任田和口粮田两块，互不交插。对占耕地大部分的责任田，发挥机械作用，以机代马。双城市还增加水利工程投资，大力组织农民开渠引水、修堤防，并根据水源充足条件奖励打井和“旱改水”。三年间增加机井８００多眼，提高了单产。几年来，虽年年有洪汛却连年获丰收。
    农民普遍认为双城的支农工作搞得好，杏山村农民周贵宁可少收入两千元，把６．５万公斤余粮全部卖给国家，由衷地说：“县（市）里政策好，服务又周到，我丰收了，不能亏心，得支援国家。”
