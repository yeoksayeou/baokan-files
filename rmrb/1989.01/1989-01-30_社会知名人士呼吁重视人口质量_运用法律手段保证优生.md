Prominent figures call for focus on population quality
Using legal measures to ensure optimal births

Our reporter, Ai Xiao, reports: "In China, one in every five families has a member with a disability. Among these disabled individuals, more than half are born with congenital disabilities. Just to care for children born with congenital disabilities or mental impairments, society spends 7 to 8 billion yuan annually. The poor quality of births has had a significant negative impact on Chinese society." This was the situation described by Chen Muxia, Vice Chairman of the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress and President of the All-China Women's Federation, on January 28 at a symposium organized by the China Association for Maternal and Child Health.

The 30 attendees unanimously agreed that population quality includes physical, cultural, and moral qualities. Among these, physical quality is the foundation and prerequisite, and optimal births are the first step in determining physical quality. It is urgent to focus on optimal births in China.

Chen Muxia pointed out that optimal birth work is broad in scope and wide in coverage, and should be conducted systematically and in a coordinated manner. For example, efforts should be made to strengthen research and promotion of optimal births, turning research findings into actions for the masses as soon as possible; legal measures should be used to ensure optimal births; food structures should be gradually improved, and nutrition levels should be reasonably increased; and the cultural and moral qualities of the population should be improved and perfected.

Yang Jike, a professor at the University of Science and Technology of China and a member of the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress, said: "In Anhui, with a population of 50 million, there are 1.5 million people with congenital disabilities, most of whom are concentrated in mountainous areas. These mountainous areas are rich in resources, but the biggest obstacle to getting rich is the low quality of the population. It is necessary for the state to formulate an optimal birth law."

Shen Qizhen, a medical expert and member of the National Committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference, suggested: "Establish a cell genetics laboratory in each provincial and municipal hospital, which would require approximately 50 million yuan nationwide; equip each county with an ultrasound machine, which would require approximately 1.1 billion yuan nationwide. Together, this amount of money is much less than the cost of raising children with congenital defects."

Professor Qian Yuping of Peking University Medical College said that in the future, the state should also have a quantitative indicator for controlling population quality, just as it does for controlling population numbers.

Money Zongzhen, a member of the Central Advisory Commission and President of the China Association for Maternal and Child Health, emphasized in his speech: "China's optimal birth work is not enough to just focus on basic and clinical research. It is necessary to mobilize the whole society to work together to complete this task."

　　社会知名人士呼吁重视人口质量    
    运用法律手段保证优生
    本报讯  记者艾笑报道：“我国每５个家庭中，就有一家有残疾人。这些残疾人中，先天致残者占一半以上。仅仅为了抚养先天病残儿或呆傻儿，全社会每年就要花费七八十亿元人民币。生育质量低劣已在我国社会中形成相当大的不幸影响。”这是全国人大常委会副委员长、全国妇联主席陈慕华１月２８日在中国优生协会召开的社会知名人士座谈会上介绍的情况。
    与会的３０位人士一致认为，人口素质应包括人口的身体素质、文化素质和道德素质。其中，身体素质是基础和前提，而优生又是决定身体素质的第一步。抓好优生工作在我国是当务之急。
    陈慕华指出，优生工作内容广、涉及面宽，应当系统、配套进行。如，大力加强优生的研究、宣传工作，使研究成果尽快转化为广大群众行动；运用法律手段保证优生；逐步改善食品结构，合理提高营养水平；提高完善人口的文化和道德等方面素质。
    全国人大常委会委员、中国科技大学杨纪珂教授说：“安徽５０００万人口中，先天性残疾１５０万，大部分集中在山区。这些山区资源很丰，致富最大的障碍是人口素质太低。国家制定优生法非常必要。”
    全国政协常委、医学专家沈其震教授建议：“在每个省市级医院设立一个细胞遗传室，全国约要用５００多万元；每县装备一台Ｂ超，全国约需１．１亿元。合起来，这笔钱也比负担先天性缺陷患儿的抚育费少得多。”
    北京医科大学钱宇平教授说，今后，国家对于人口素质的控制，也应像数量控制一样，宜有一个定量的指标为好。
    中顾委委员、中国优生协会会长钱信忠在发言中也强调：“中国的优生工作只做基础和临床研究是不够的，必须动员全社会通力协作，共同完成。”
