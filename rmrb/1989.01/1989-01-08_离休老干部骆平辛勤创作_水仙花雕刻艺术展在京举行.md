Elegant and graceful water lilies are in full bloom today at the Tanghua Garden in Zhongshan Park, bringing a sense of spring warmth to visitors who have braved the snow.

Upon entering the exhibition hall, over 30 different water lily sculptures are displayed. Some resemble a pair of mandarin ducks playing in the water, others like a peacock spreading its tail, and some look like a kingfisher welcoming spring, all of which evoke admiration.

These exquisite water lily artworks are the creations of Luo Ping, a retired cadre from the central government organs. To welcome the Year of the Snake, Luo Ping recently meticulously carved and cultivated a water lily with a long, green ribbon-like stem, swaying as if dancing, and presented it to the audience.

Peng Chong, Liao Hansheng, Ni Zhifu, and Chen Muhua visited the exhibition.

　　离休老干部骆平辛勤创作
    水仙花雕刻艺术展在京举行
    新华社北京１月７日电  绰约多姿的水仙花今天盛开在中山公园的唐花坞，使踏雪而来的参观者感受到融融春意。
    步入展厅，呈现在人们面前的水仙花造型不下３０余种。有的像鸳鸯戏水、有的如孔雀开屏、有的又似翠鸟迎春，令人赞叹不已。
    这些水仙花艺术佳作出自中央机关离休老干部骆平之手。为迎接蛇年的到来，骆平最近又精心雕刻培植出一株拖着长长的绿带、飘飘欲舞的“白蛇娘娘”，奉献给观众。
    彭冲、廖汉生、倪志福、陈慕华等参观了展览。
