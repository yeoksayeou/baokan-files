Recently, I went to Nanxin Township in Nanchang County, Jiangxi Province, known for its grain production. From some township officials, I learned that farmers are unwilling to sell their grain at negotiated prices to the grain department.

This township produced 72.5 million kilograms of grain last year. After completing the mandatory procurement quota, there was still surplus grain. The higher authorities allocated a quota of 12.66 million kilograms of negotiated-price grain for this township, with a price of 33 yuan per 50 kilograms. However, by November 7, the township had sold less than 5 million kilograms of negotiated-price grain. What is the reason for this?

	•	Weight Deductions. When farmers sell grain to the grain department, the department's rule is to deduct 1.5 to 3 kilograms per 100 kilograms as weight for impurities and moisture. In reality, grain with moisture cannot be stored in the warehouse, and if the grain contains sand, dirt, or other impurities, it can be rejected. Currently, the department takes a one-size-fits-all approach, deducting weight uniformly, which penalizes honest farmers, making them unhappy.

	•	Issuing I.O.U.s. Recently, farmers received I.O.U.s instead of cash when selling grain, or the payments were deducted in various ways, making farmers unwilling to sell.

	•	Hoping for Price Increases. Since last year, the price of negotiated-price grain has been adjusted seven times, each time increasing. This has created a psychological effect on farmers: prices will continue to rise, so they wait and see. While it is possible to adjust the price of negotiated-price grain according to market conditions, seven adjustments in one year is too frequent. This also encourages some farmers to hold onto their grain, unwilling to sell early.

Last year, some places experienced poor grain harvests, and it is undoubtedly correct to purchase more grain in grain-producing areas. However, if the methods and services are not good, the wish to purchase more grain from farmers will be in vain.

### 农民为什么不卖粮

　　农民为什么不卖粮
    最近我到以产粮闻名的江西南昌县南新乡，从一些乡干部那儿得知：农民不愿把粮食议价卖给粮食部门。
    这个乡去年产粮７２５０万公斤，除了完成征购粮任务之外，还有余粮。上级给这个乡卖议价粮１２６６万公斤的指标，每５０公斤价为３３元，但到１１月７日止，这个乡卖出的议价粮不到５００万公斤。这是什么原因呢？
    ——扣斤两。农民卖粮给粮食部门，这个部门订的规矩是，每１００公斤要扣除１．５—３公斤，作为杂质和水分的重量。其实有水分的稻谷是不能进仓的，如果稻谷里掺进了砂泥之类杂质，完全可以拒收。现在采取一棒打杀的态度，一律打折扣收购，叫老实人吃亏，农民就不高兴。
    ——开白条。前不久，农民卖粮后得的是白条，拿不到现金，或者是七扣八扣，农民不乐意。
    ——盼涨价。去年以来，议价粮食的价格已经调价７次，每次均往上浮动，对农民产生一种心理影响：价格还会上涨，再等一等看。收议价粮固然可以随行就市，但一年内涨７次也太“勤”了点。这也促使一部分农民待价而沽，不愿早日卖粮。
    去年有些地方粮食歉收，在产粮地区多收购一点粮食无疑是对的，但若不注意方式方法，服务得不好，从农民手里想多购些粮的愿望，是会落空的。
