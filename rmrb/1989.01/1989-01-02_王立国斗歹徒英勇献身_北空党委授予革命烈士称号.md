Only 20 years old, Corporal Wang Liguo bravely fought to protect state property in the face of a knife-wielding thug and sacrificed his life. On December 28 of last year, the Beijing Military Region Air Force held a commendation meeting, posthumously recognizing Wang Liguo as a formal member of the Communist Party of China. The North China Air Force Party Committee awarded him the honorable title of Revolutionary Martyr.

On the early morning of October 4 last year, at around 2:00 AM, medic Wang Liguo was on duty in the pharmacy when a knife-wielding thug broke in through the window. Wang Liguo woke up from his bed and quickly grabbed the thug with both hands. The thug wildly stabbed him. Wang Liguo was stabbed 38 times but still held onto the criminal's hand. He eventually succumbed to blood loss and died a heroic death.
