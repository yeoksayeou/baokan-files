The photographs on this page reflect the widespread phenomenon of excessive childbearing in our lives, which is not an isolated case. This situation is worrying!

Since the early 1970s, China has implemented family planning policies. Over the past decade, the country has prevented the birth of over 200 million people, achieving remarkable results that have garnered global attention. However, due to China's fundamental national conditions—backward productive forces and underdeveloped economy and culture—coupled with the influence of outdated and superstitious traditional concepts from thousands of years of feudal society, it is difficult to change the habits of people wanting to have more children and preferring male children. After the reform and opening up, family planning work has encountered new problems. Therefore, China's population situation is not only not optimistic but also quite severe.

According to relevant departments, based on the current population status, birth policies, and work levels, from 1988 to 1996, an average of 22 million people will be born each year, and from 1996 to 2000, an average of 18 million people will be born each year. Over 13 years, a total of 266 million people will be born, minus the 106 million who will die during this period, resulting in a net increase of 160 million people. Adding this to the current population of 1.08 billion, by the end of the century, the population will reach 1.24 billion. If effective control measures are not taken, by the end of the century, the population will reach or even exceed 1.3 billion. At that time, the long-term goal of doubling the national GDP and achieving a moderately prosperous life for the people will be difficult to achieve due to the excessive population.

Let the alarm bells of population concerns ring constantly in our lives! —Editor

	Breaking the Family Planning Law is Unacceptable

	In Anhu Province, Funan County, Xutang Township, Miyuan Village, Dr. Chen Juzhang forged sterilization operation certificates and illegally sold them for 50 to 150 yuan each for personal gain. He has recently been caught and exposed (right photo). This peasant woman (left photo) spent nearly 100 yuan to buy a forged sterilization certificate to have more children, but now it has become a worthless piece of paper. The above photo shows some of the forged sterilization certificates.

	Overcrowded

	This is the crowd on Nanjing Road in Shanghai, a sea of people that makes one feel suffocated. Shanghai, which is already overcrowded, now has an additional 2 million floating population every day, adding many difficulties that are hard to resolve in various aspects of the city.

    在我们生活里——人口的警钟
    本版照片反映的人口多生、超生现象，在我们生活里不是个别的。这种情况令人担忧！
    自70年代初，我国实行计划生育，10多年间，全国少生了2亿多人，成绩举世瞩目。但是，由于我国基本国情是生产力落后，经济文化不发达，加之几千年封建社会遗留下的愚昧、陈腐的传统观念影响，人们想多生孩子及偏爱男孩的陋习很不容易改变。改革开放以后，计划生育工作又出现不少新问题，所以，我国人口形势非但不容乐观，而且相当严峻。
    据有关部门预测：按照目前我国人口现状、生育政策及工作水平，在1988—1996年的8年间，平均每年要出生2200万人，1996—2000年的5年间，平均每年要出生1800万人，13年共要出生2.66亿人，减去其间死亡的1.06亿人，人口要净增1.6亿。加上现有的10.8亿，到本世纪末人口将达12.4亿。如果不切实采取控制措施，到本世纪末人口将达到甚至超过13亿。那时，人们长期为之奋斗的目标——国民生产总值翻两番、国民生活达到小康水平，将因人口过多而难以实现。
    让人口忧患的警钟在我们生活里常鸣！　——编者（附图片）
