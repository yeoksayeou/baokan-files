For the implementation of the resolution on Namibian independence to begin on April 1.

Angolan President hopes South Africa will also fulfill its commitments.

Bush writes to Savimbi urging UNITA to reconcile with the government.

	Xinhua News Agency, Luanda, January 12th — Angolan President Dos Santos said on the 11th that the Angolan side has already begun to implement the withdrawal agreement and hopes that South Africa will also fulfill its commitments, providing convenience for the work of the UN Secretary-General and his representatives, so that the implementation of the 435th resolution on Namibian independence can begin on April 1.

	President Dos Santos made the above remarks during an interview with American journalists on the 11th. He also hopes that the United States, as a mediator, will continue to play an active role in the process of achieving Namibian independence.

	Dos Santos emphasized that the 435th resolution should be fully implemented, and modifying the resolution means breaking the commitments already made. He is concerned about certain issues surrounding the 435th resolution in the UN Security Council and hopes that the Security Council will not change the number of UN personnel monitoring Namibia.

	The Angolan President said that after the withdrawal of Cuban troops, Angola's top priority is to achieve peace. Angola hopes to first implement the 435th resolution, and secondly, the anti-government armed forces should stop the war.

	Dos Santos hopes that the UNITA issue will not become an obstacle to the normalization of Angolan-American relations, and the two governments should quickly make contact regarding the normalization of relations.

	Xinhua News Agency, Washington, January 12th — Recently, U.S. President-elect Bush assured the leader of the Angolan anti-government forces, Savimbi, that the United States will continue to provide military and diplomatic support to the National Union for the Total Independence of Angola (UNITA).

	In a letter dated January 6th to Savimbi, Bush simultaneously urged UNITA to reconcile with the government.

	He said, "The next U.S. government will work with other countries to promote an agreement between UNITA and the government to achieve national reconciliation."

	He added, "Until this goal is achieved, the government I lead will continue to support all appropriate and effective measures for UNITA."

　　为４月１日开始实施关于纳米比亚独立决议
    安哥拉总统希望南非也履行承诺
    布什致函萨文比敦促安盟与政府和解
    新华社罗安达１月１２日电  安哥拉总统多斯桑托斯１１日说，安古方面已经开始履行撤军协议，希望南非也履行承诺，为联合国秘书长及其代表的工作提供方便，以便在４月１日开始实施关于纳米比亚独立的４３５号决议。
    多斯桑托斯总统是在１１日接见美国记者采访时作出上述表示的。他还希望，作为调解人的美国也应在实现纳米比亚独立进程方面继续起积极作用。
    多斯桑托斯强调说，４３５号决议应当得到全部实施，修改决议意味着违背已作出的承诺。他对联合国安理会围绕４３５号决议产生的某些问题感到担忧，希望安理会不要改变联合国驻纳米比亚监督人员的数目。
    安哥拉总统说，古巴撤军后，安哥拉的首要任务是实现和平，安希望首先能开始实施４３５号决议，其次是安反政府武装应停止战争。
    多斯桑托斯希望安盟问题不要成为安美关系正常化的障碍，两国政府应尽快就关系正常化进行接触。
    新华社华盛顿１月１２日电　美国当选总统布什最近向安哥拉反政府力量领导人萨文比作出保证，美国将继续向争取安哥拉彻底独立全国联盟（安盟）提供军事和外交支持。
    布什在１月６日给萨文比的一封信中同时又敦促安盟与政府实现和解。
    他说，下届美国政府将与其他国家一起努力，促成安盟与政府间达成一项协议，实现民族和解。
    他又说，“在此目标达到之前，我所领导的政府将继续对安盟的一切合适、有效的支持。”
