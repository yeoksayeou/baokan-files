	Promoting Hospital Management and Encouraging Bold Reforms: 84 Outstanding Hospital Directors Honored

	BEIJING, Jan. 14 (Xinhua) -- Eighty-four hospital directors were honored today at the Great Hall of the People for their outstanding achievements in management and reform. They received certificates of honor.

	This is the first time since the founding of the People's Republic of China that an evaluation of outstanding hospital management personnel has been conducted. The event was organized by the Ministry of Health and the State Administration of Traditional Chinese Medicine, and hosted by the Health Newspaper Society.

	Currently, there are 12,800 county-level and above hospitals in China, with 300,000 health management personnel. However, there is a shortage of high-quality health administrative management personnel. The outstanding directors selected through this evaluation, who have served for more than two years, are mostly individuals who have given up their professional careers to engage in management work. Among them, 85% hold the title of associate chief physician or higher.

	In addition to receiving certificates of honor, each recipient was awarded a prize of 1,000 yuan and a one-level salary increase.

	Minister of Health Chen Minzhang said in his speech after the award ceremony: "This small amount of prize money is not enough to reflect the value of the contributions made by these outstanding management personnel, as they are the guardians of human life and health."

　　促进医院管理　鼓励锐意改革
  　８４名全国优秀医院院长受表彰
    本报北京１月１４日讯  记者艾笑报道：８４名医院院长因其在管理和改革中成绩突出而被评为全国优秀院长。他们的代表今天在首都人民大会堂接受了荣誉证书。
    这一建国以来首次进行的优秀医院管理干部评选活动是由卫生部、国家中医药管理局委托《健康报》社举办的。
    目前，我国有县级以上医院１．２８万所，卫生管理干部３０万人，但缺乏高素质的卫生行政管理干部。这次通过各部门层层审核评选出的优秀院长都是有两年以上院长任期的，绝大多数人舍弃自己的专业，从临床改行做管理工作。其中副主任医师以上职称者占８５％。
    这次奖励，除颁发荣誉证书外，每人还获得１０００元奖金并晋升一级工资。
    卫生部长陈敏章在颁奖后讲话说：“这点奖金不足以体现这些优秀管理干部的贡献值价，因为他们是人类生命和健康的保护神”。
