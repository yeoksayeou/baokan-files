The annual Asia-Europe Table Tennis Competition, held alternately in the two continents, has been held for four years since its inception in 1986. Looking through the overall results, a few interesting patterns emerge: in men's team and singles events, the Asia and Europe teams each won two championships, splitting the honors evenly, and the host team always emerged victorious. In women's team and singles events, the Asian team has won all eight championships, and European women have yet to taste victory.

Here is the list of champions:

First Round (in Europe):
Men's Team: Europe 6-2 Asia
Women's Team: Asia 4-2 Europe
Men's Singles: Poland's Grubba
Women's Singles: China's Jiao Zhimin

　　亚欧乒乓球对抗赛历届成绩小结
    一年一度轮流在两洲举行的亚欧乒乓球对抗赛，自一九八六年创办以来已经打完第四届。翻一翻总的成绩资料可以发现几个有意思的情况：男子团体和单打，亚欧两队都是各得两次冠军，平分秋色，而且均是谁“做东”谁取胜；女子团体和单打，亚洲队包揽八个冠军，欧洲女将至今未尝过得胜的滋味。下面是冠军名录：
    第一届（在欧洲），男团，欧洲队六比二胜；女团，亚洲队四比二胜；男单，波兰格鲁巴；女单，中国焦志敏。
    第二届（在亚洲），男团，亚洲队五比三胜；女团，亚洲队五比一胜；男单，中国陈龙灿；女单，中国戴丽丽。
    第三届（在欧洲），男团，欧洲队五比一胜；女团，亚洲队三比一胜；男单，瑞典瓦尔德内尔；女单，朝鲜李粉姬。
    第四届（在亚洲），男团，亚洲队五比四胜；女团，亚洲队三比一胜；男单，南朝鲜金泽洙；女单，中国陈静。
