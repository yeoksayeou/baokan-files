In the bustling Chang'an Road of Shijiazhuang, there is a small store named Chang'an Shop. In front of the store, there are "Friendship" brand refrigerators, with torn red promotional posters trembling as if telling passersby about the store's misfortune.

Last September, the rush to buy refrigerators in Shijiazhuang was at its peak. Some people even took home refrigerators with missing wheels and doors that wouldn't open. For a while, stores selling refrigerators made a fortune. Chang'an Shop also seized the opportunity and bought a batch of "Jinniu" brand refrigerators, which sold out instantly. Then, they ordered another batch of "Friendship" brand refrigerators. Unfortunately, by the time the goods arrived in early October, the buying frenzy had subsided, and those who wanted to buy refrigerators saw that this batch was of second-grade quality and left.

The store manager hurriedly called the supplier: Why are second-grade goods being supplied at first-grade prices? The supplier said: "Your salesperson knows." It turned out that the store's salesperson, Wang, had bought two "Jiamelai" refrigerators from someone at a price lower than the purchase price, clearly indicating that the salesperson had taken bribes and bought inferior goods. Unable to seek compensation, the store had to mobilize all its staff to promote the sales. But after visiting dozens of places, not a single one of the 30 refrigerators was sold.

The small store, which had only 80,000 yuan in funds obtained through loans, was burdened with 70,000 yuan by this batch of refrigerators, losing all its vitality.

After the refrigerators were piled up, what happened to the salesperson? "He went to work at another unit," the manager said. "The behavior of salespeople should be regulated and constrained. It cannot be like this now, with no one in charge, taking bribes for personal gain, and running away when trouble arises."

### 业务员贪好处进次货  小商店倒大霉莫奈何

　　业务员贪好处进次货
    小商店倒大霉莫奈何
    据新华社石家庄１月７日电  （记者叶冰男、实习生王国辰）在石家庄繁华的长安路上，有个门面很小的长安商店。店门前放着“友谊”牌冰箱，残破的红纸推销广告在上面颤抖，仿佛在向行人诉说小店的不幸。
    去年９月，石家庄市抢购风正紧。有的人把缺轮歪门不开机的冰箱也搬回家去。一时间卖冰箱的商店大发其财。长安商店也不失时机地进了一批“劲牛”牌冰箱，一销而空。接着，他们又订了一批“友谊”牌冰箱。不料货到之日已是１０月上旬，抢购风已近尾声，想买冰箱的人见这批货是二等品，都纷纷离去。
    商店经理忙打电话问供货单位：为何一等价钱供二等货？对方说：“你们业务员都清楚。”原来，这个商店的业务员王某从人家那里买了两台“家美乐”电冰箱，价格比进价还低，很显然，是自己的业务员贪好处进了次货，无法索赔，商店只好让全部人员出动搞推销。但跑了几十个地方，３０台冰箱连一台也没卖出去。
    加上贷款才有８万元资金的这家小商店，被这批冰箱压死了７万元，生机顿消。
    冰箱积压后，业务员怎样了呢？“他跑到别的单位上班了”，经理说。“业务员的行为应有个规范和约束，不能像现在这样没人管，贪便宜收贿赂，惹了麻烦一走了之。”
