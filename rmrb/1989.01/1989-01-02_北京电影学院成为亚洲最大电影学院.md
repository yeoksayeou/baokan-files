Beijing Film Academy has become the largest film academy in Asia. According to Xinhua News Agency in Beijing on January 1st, since its establishment in 1956, Beijing Film Academy has trained many backbone members for China's film industry. In the more than ten years since the Cultural Revolution, they have nurtured many well-known creative and performing talents recognized by the audience, including directors such as Zhang Yimou, Chen Kaige, and Tian Zhuangzhuang, who have won international awards, and famous actors such as Fang Shu, Zhou Lijin, Shen Danping, and Lin Fangbing. These students, who once studied in classrooms that were originally dining halls, have laid a solid foundation for their future success through diligent study. The academy has utilized its own advantages to establish the Youth Film Studio as a teaching and experimental base, producing films such as "Ying," "Shaou," "Linju," "Qingchun Ji," "Zhenzhen's Hair Salon," "Xiangnv Xiaoxiao," and "Rock and Roll Youth," which have had a significant impact on the public. Currently, the academy has completed a large-scale, advanced-equipment teaching building, becoming the largest film academy in Asia.

In mid-February of this year, Beijing Film Academy plans to enroll nearly one hundred students in six majors: acting, cinematography, art, sound recording, screenwriting, and production. Among these, the most notable acting major will hold admissions in Beijing, Shanghai, Yantai, and Chongqing, and is also prepared to accept applications from Hong Kong, Macau, and overseas Chinese youth.

　　北京电影学院成为亚洲最大电影学院
    据新华社北京１月１日电  北京电影学院从１９５６年建院至今，为我国电影队伍培养了骨干。仅从“文革”以后的十多年间，他们造就了许多为观众所熟知的创作表演人才，包括张艺谋、陈凯歌、田壮壮等在国际上获奖的导演和方舒、周里京、沈丹萍、林芳兵等著名演员。这些学生当年在食堂充作的教室里上课，潜心钻研，为以后的成功打下了扎实的基础。学院利用自身优势，组建了青年电影制片厂作为教学实验基地，拍出《樱》、《沙鸥》、《邻居》、《青春祭》、《珍珍的发屋》、《湘女萧萧》、《摇滚青年》等在群众中产生较大影响的影片。目前，学院又建成了规模较大、设备先进的教学大楼，成为亚洲最大的电影学院。
    今年２月中旬，北京电影学院计划在表演、摄影、美术、录音、编剧、制片六个专业招收近百名学生。其中最受关注的表演系将在北京、上海、烟台、重庆接待考生，并准备接受港澳、华侨青年报考。
