Rushing to Perform Abroad, Undercutting Prices, and Engaging in Cutthroat Competition

The management of commercial performances by Chinese arts groups abroad is in chaos. Reporter Luo Hui learned this during an interview in Wuhan with Xia Juhua, the chairman of the China Acrobatics Association, who had just returned from an overseas performance.

According to Xia, many arts groups are currently rushing to perform in the same countries, undercutting each other's prices, and engaging in cutthroat competition, which is creating a negative impression internationally.

The Wuhan Acrobatics Troupe was invited by the Canadian National Artists' Performance Company and approved by the State Council, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, the Ministry of Culture, and the Ministry of Forestry to perform in 11 Canadian cities for 35 shows from early September to late December 1988. According to the contract, no other Chinese acrobatics troupe was to be sent to Canada that year, otherwise, the Wuhan Acrobatics Troupe's performance fee would only be paid half. The relevant departments and leaders responsible for signing the contract all expressed approval. However, the management of domestic arts groups performing abroad is not strict, and three other acrobatics troupes went to Canada during the same period as the Wuhan Acrobatics Troupe. One of these troupes from a coastal city had received a notice from the relevant departments not to go to Canada, but still insisted on going and performed at the same time as the Wuhan Acrobatics Troupe. Before this, this troupe had repeatedly lowered the price for the Canadian performance company, offering a price per show that was 4,000 Canadian dollars less than the Wuhan Acrobatics Troupe, attempting to snatch the Wuhan Acrobatics Troupe's performance contract. This internal competition not only lowered the country's credibility but also affected the income of the performing units.

Under the condition of opening up to the outside world, arts groups have more opportunities to perform abroad, which creates opportunities and conditions for strengthening cultural exchanges and achieving good economic benefits for the troupes. However, relevant departments should strengthen management, and local authorities should also communicate with each other to avoid the same arts groups performing in the same places abroad. Another important aspect is to ensure artistic quality and not to neglect anything just for the sake of performing abroad or making money.

　　争相出洋　互相压价　恶性竞争
    文艺界出国商业演出管理混乱
    记者在武汉采访刚率团从国外演出回国的中国杂技艺术家协会主席夏菊花时了解到：当前我国文艺团体到国外举行商业性演出十分混乱。一些同类文艺团体争相到同一个国家演出，互相压价，恶性竞争，在国际上造成不良影响。
    据介绍，应加拿大国家艺术家演出公司邀请，经国务院、外交部、文化部和林业部批准，武汉杂技团于１９８８年９月上旬至１２月上旬在加拿大的１１个城市演出３５场。按合同规定，中国同年不再派其它杂技团去加，否则武汉杂技团的演出费只付给一半。负责签约的有关部门及领导均表示赞许。然而，国内文艺团体出国演出并没有严格管理，与武汉杂技团同期先后又有３个杂技团去了加拿大。其中沿海某大城市的一个杂技团已获得有关部门不要赴加的通知，但仍然执意前往，与武汉杂技团同时演出。在此之前，这个杂技团对加拿大演出商一再压低价码，以每场低于武汉杂技团４０００加元的价格，试图抢走武汉杂技团的演出合同。这种自相争斗，既降低了国家的信誉，又影响了演出单位的收入。
    在对外开放的条件下，文艺团体出国演出的途径多了，这对加强文化交流，为剧团获取良好的经济效益创造了机会和条件。但是，有关部门应加强管理，各地也应互相通气，避免同样的艺术团体在国外撞车。另一个重要的方面，是要确保艺术质量，不能只是为了出国或赚钱就什么都不顾。
