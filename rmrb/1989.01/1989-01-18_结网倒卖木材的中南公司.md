The editor's note:

The letter and investigation report revealed the issue of the Middle South Company under the China Timber Corporation engaging in timber reselling, which has been investigated by relevant departments. However, the matter is not yet fully resolved. The people involved in the network of timber reselling and the relevant responsible persons of the Middle South Company should be dealt with appropriately. Their supervisory departments should also bear the corresponding responsibilities. These are issues of concern to the public, and the relevant departments should provide a satisfactory response.

The Middle South Company's Network of Timber Reselling
By Wang Weixiang, Reporter of This Newspaper

The Middle South Company is a state-owned enterprise under the China Timber Corporation. In November 1987, the Middle South Company, according to the state plan, purchased 6,068 cubic meters of imported pine timber from the China Timber Corporation at a price of 203 yuan per cubic meter. On December 23, this batch of timber was verified and entered the warehouse, with a total amount of 1,231,800 yuan. On the same day, the Middle South Company "sold" 4,100 cubic meters of this timber to the Wuhan Changjiang Timber Trading Company, a joint venture of the China Timber Corporation, the Middle South Company, and the Wuhan Municipal Timber Company, at a price of 242 yuan per cubic meter. Seven days later, without moving the goods, the Wuhan Changjiang Timber Trading Company "resold" this batch of timber back to the Middle South Company at a price of 480 yuan per cubic meter. In this way, they easily converted this batch of state-planned timber into non-planned timber, and the planned price into a negotiated price. On December 31, the Middle South Company sold the 4,100 cubic meters of timber to the Hai'an County Agricultural Materials Company in Jiangsu at a price of 500 yuan per cubic meter. After several transactions, the Middle South Company and the Wuhan Changjiang Timber Trading Company made a profit of over 120 million yuan.

On January 29, 1988, the Middle South Company again purchased 7,112 cubic meters of imported timber from the China Timber Corporation at a price of 163 yuan per cubic meter. They repeated the same process, first "selling" it to the Wuhan Changjiang Timber Trading Company at a price of 202 yuan per cubic meter. The Wuhan Changjiang Timber Trading Company then raised the price of this batch of timber to 505 yuan per cubic meter and "resold" it back to the Middle South Company. Subsequently, the Middle South Company sold this batch of timber to the Nantong Municipal Timber Company in Jiangsu at a price of 510 yuan per cubic meter. Thus, after several transactions, the two units made a profit of over 243 million yuan.

It is understood that after obtaining the above two batches of timber, the Hai'an County Agricultural Materials Company and the Nantong Timber Company sold them to nearly 20 timber trading markets.

Just after the second batch of timber was sold, the Middle South Company applied to the China Timber Corporation for the import of timber and, through connections, reached an agreement with the Fengkai County Metals and Electrical Appliances Company in Guangdong to provide US dollars for payment, with the Middle South Company responsible for settling accounts with the China Timber Corporation. On May 30, 1988, the Middle South Company imported 24,428 cubic meters of timber. The Fengkai County Metals and Electrical Appliances Company exchanged 14.64 million yuan into 2.44 million US dollars to pay for the goods. Thus, the price per cubic meter of timber was 598.5 yuan. On July 31, the Fengkai County Metals and Electrical Appliances Company "resold" this batch of timber back to the Middle South Company at a price of 631 yuan per cubic meter, making a profit of over 7.9 million yuan. In fact, as early as June 27, the Middle South Company had sold 23,928 cubic meters of this timber to the Shanghai Timber Supply Company's timber trading market at a price of 725 yuan per cubic meter. In addition to the 7.9 million yuan profit made by the Fengkai County Metals and Electrical Appliances Company and the payment of 12.8 million yuan in port fees, the Middle South Company still made a profit of over 6.5 million yuan.

According to the contract, the 12.8 million yuan in port fees should be jointly borne by the Middle South Company and the Fengkai County Metals and Electrical Appliances Company. In reality, the port fees were borne by the Middle South Company. The Middle South Company was so generous for a reason. Originally, in March, April, and August 1988, the Fengkai County Metals and Electrical Appliances Company gave the relevant personnel of the Middle South Company a total of 7 color televisions. Among them, 3 televisions were collected at the purchase price or below the purchase price, and the remaining 4 televisions had not been collected at all by the time of the reporter's investigation. According to the disclosure from Guangdong, in this timber transaction, some of the handling personnel of the Middle South Company also received a considerable amount of kickbacks.

In mid-November 1988, when the relevant leaders of the Middle South Company heard that the tax, financial, and price inspection team was going to inspect their accounts, they hastily convened a meeting of middle-level cadres to unify their statements and discuss countermeasures. A responsible person claimed: Let the inspection team take away a few ten thousand yuan to get rid of them. On December 24, 1988, the Central Enterprise Finance Office of the Ministry of Finance in Hubei Province and the "Three Inspections" Office of the Hubei Provincial People's Government confiscated over 11 million yuan of the Middle South Company's illegal income from timber reselling and other sources and handed it over to the state treasury.

The relevant state departments have clearly stipulated: It is not allowed to arbitrarily convert planned products into non-planned products for high-price sales, not allowed to resell raw materials and other goods at high prices, not allowed for various companies and economic organizations to engage in local reselling of important production materials (whether planned or non-planned) and scarce consumer goods, or resell delivery notes at a higher price to raise prices. However, why did the Middle South Company knowingly violate these regulations? Did their superior department, the China Timber Corporation, know about their actions? More puzzling is why the China Timber Corporation was so accommodating to the Middle South Company, repeatedly allocating a large amount of planned timber? These questions are worth serious consideration and response from the relevant departments.

　　结网倒卖木材的中南公司
    本报记者  王维香
    中南公司是中国木材总公司下属的一个国营企业。１９８７年１１月，中南公司按照国家计划，从中国木材总公司以每立方米２０３元的价格购进进口松木６０６８立方米。１２月２３日，这批木材验收入库，总金额为１２３．１８万元。当天，中南公司将其中的４１００立方米木材以每立方米２４２元的价格“卖”给了由中国木材总公司、中南公司和武汉市木材公司３家联合开办的武汉长江木材贸易公司。７天之后，武汉长江木材贸易公司在货物未动的情况下，又将这批木材以每立方米４８０元的价格“回卖”给中南公司。这样，他们轻而易举地将这批国家计划内木材转成了计划外木材，平价转成了议价。１２月３１日，中南公司将４１００立方米木材以每立方米５００元的价格卖给江苏海安县农资公司。几经倒手，中南公司和武汉长江木材贸易公司从中获利１２０多万元。
    １９８８年１月２９日，中南公司又从中国木材总公司购进进口木材７１１２立方米，单价为１６３元。他们又如法炮制，先以每立方米２０２元的价格“卖”给武汉长江木材贸易公司。武汉长江木材贸易公司又将这批木材的价格提到每立方米５０５元，“回卖”给中南公司。接着，中南公司又将这批木材以每立方米５１０元的价格倒卖给江苏南通市木材公司。于是，几经倒腾，这两个单位又获利２４３万多元。
    据了解，海安县农资公司和南通木材公司在得到以上两批木材后，又分别卖给了近２０家木材交易市场。
    第二批木材刚刚脱手，中南公司又向中国木材总公司申请进口木材，并通过关系与广东封开县五金交电公司达成协议，由封开县五金交电公司提供美元支付货款，中南公司负责与中国木材总公司结算帐目。１９８８年５月３０日，中南公司进口了２４４２８立方米木材。封开县五金交电公司用１４６４万元人民币，兑换了２４４万美元，以支付货款。这样，每立方米木材的价格为５９８．５元人民币。７月３１日，封开县五金交电公司又将这批木材以每立方米６３１元“回卖”给中南公司，获利７９万多元。其实，早在６月２７日，中南公司就将这批木材中的２３９２８立方米卖给了上海木材供应公司木材交易市场，每立方米售价７２５元。除了封开县五金交电公司赚取的７９万多元，以及支付１２８万元港口费外，中南公司仍获利６５万多元。
    按合同规定：１２８万元港口费应由中南公司和封开县五金交电公司共同负担。实际上，港口费由中南公司承担了。中南公司如此慷慨，其中是有奥妙的。原来，１９８８年３月、４月、８月，封开县五金交电公司给中南公司有关人员先后送了７台彩色电视机。其中３台电视机按进价或低于进价收款，其余４台到记者调查时分文未收。据广东方面揭发，在这次木材交易中，中南公司的个别经办人员，还捞取了一笔数目可观的回扣。
    １９８８年１１月中旬，中南公司有关领导人听说税收、财务、物价大检查工作组要检查他们的帐目时，便匆忙召开公司中层干部会议，统一口径，商量对策。一位负责人声称：让检查组拿走几万块钱，把他们打发走算了。１９８８年１２月２４日，财政部驻湖北省财政厅中央企业财政驻厂员处、湖北省人民政府“三查”领导小组办公室将中南公司倒卖木材及其它非法收入１１０多万元没收，上缴国库。
    国家有关部门明确规定：不许将计划内产品擅自转为计划外产品高价销售，不许高价倒卖原材料和其它商品，不许各类公司等经济组织之间，就地转手加价倒卖重要生产资料（不论计划内外）和紧俏消费品，或加价倒卖提货单，抬高价格。然而，中南公司为什么明知故犯？他们的所作所为，其上级主管部门中国木材总公司是否清楚？更令人不解的是，中国木材总公司为什么对中南公司有求必应，接连调拨大量计划内木材呢？这些问题值得有关部门认真思考并作出回答。
