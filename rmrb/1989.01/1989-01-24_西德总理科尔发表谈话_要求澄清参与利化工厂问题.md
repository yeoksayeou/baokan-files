West German Chancellor Kohl today, in a conversation with Deutsche Welle reporters, demanded an "unreserved clarification" of the involvement of West German companies in the alleged Libyan chemical weapons factory.

Kohl said that the matter must be clarified, regardless of who or which company is involved. There is "nothing to hide" in this matter, and the involvement of West German companies or individuals in the production of chemical weapons is unacceptable.

Kohl reiterated that the draft law on strengthening export controls must be submitted to parliament for deliberation before Easter. The West German government had decided on January 10 to strictly monitor and control the export of nuclear technology, chemical equipment, and other materials with military strategic significance.

　　西德总理科尔发表谈话     
    要求澄清参与利化工厂问题
    新华社波恩１月２２日电  西德总理科尔今天在同德意志电台记者的谈话中，要求“无保留地澄清”西德公司参与利比亚所谓化学武器工厂一事。
    科尔说，必须澄清这件事，不管涉及到谁或哪家公司。在这件事情上是“没有什么好遮掩的”，西德公司或个人参与化学武器生产，这是不能容忍的。
    科尔重申，在复活节前必须把有关强化出口控制的法律提案提交议会审议。西德政府曾在本月１０日作出决定，严格监督和控制核技术、化工设备以及其他具有军事战略意义的物资出口。
