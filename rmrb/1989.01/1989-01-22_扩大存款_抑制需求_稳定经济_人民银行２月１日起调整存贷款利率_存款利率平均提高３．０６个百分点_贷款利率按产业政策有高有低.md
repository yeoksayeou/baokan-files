Expanding Deposits, Suppressing Demand, Stabilizing the Economy

People's Bank to Adjust Deposit and Loan Interest Rates Starting February 1

Average Deposit Interest Rates Increased by 3.06 Percentage Points

Loan Interest Rates Vary by Industry Policy

Xinhua News Agency, January 21 — Reporter Liu Xiao reports: The spokesperson for the People's Bank of China announced today that, with the approval of the State Council, the bank has decided to adjust various deposit and loan interest rates starting February 1.

The spokesperson said that on September 1 last year, adjustments were made to deposit and loan interest rates, and on September 10, it was announced that a value-preservation policy would be implemented for savings deposits of three years or more. These measures have played a good role in stabilizing the economy, stabilizing finance, expanding bank deposits, and suppressing the demand for funds. To a certain extent, they have protected the interests of depositors and have been warmly welcomed by the broad masses of the people.

The main contents of this interest rate adjustment are as follows:

First, the deposit interest rates for urban and rural residents and enterprises and institutions will be increased, and the value-preservation policy for savings deposits of three years or more will continue. The interest rate for six-month fixed-term deposits will be increased from the current annual rate of 6.48% to 9.0%; the interest rate for one-year deposits will be increased from the current annual rate of 8.64% to 11.34%; the interest rate for two-year deposits will be increased from the current annual rate of 9.18% to 12.24%; the interest rate for three-year deposits will be increased from the current annual rate of 9.72% to 13.14%; the interest rate for five-year deposits will be increased from the current annual rate of 10.8% to 14.94%; the interest rate for eight-year deposits will be increased from the current annual rate of 12.42% to 17.64%. The average increase in interest rates for all deposit categories is 3.06 percentage points. The value-preservation policy for savings deposits of three years or more for urban and rural residents will continue, that is, on the basis of the adjusted interest rates for each category, an additional value-preservation supplement rate will be added. If the price level falls below the adjusted interest rate level, interest will still be paid according to the adjusted interest rate.

The interest rates for savings deposits handled by banks, such as regular savings, savings with interest, savings with withdrawal, and savings with flexible terms, as well as savings deposits for overseas Chinese in renminbi, will be increased accordingly.

Second, loan interest rates will be increased. After the deposit interest rates are increased and the value-preservation policy is implemented for savings deposits of three years or more, the bank's interest expenses will increase significantly, and the loan interest rates must be increased accordingly. The interest rate for working capital loans will be increased from the current annual rate of 9.0% to 11.34%, an increase of 2.34 percentage points, equal to the one-year deposit interest rate. However, the interest rates for loans of less than one year will be lower than this level; in addition, the interest rates for loans for the purchase of grain, cotton, oil, and foreign trade products will not be increased this time, and the interest rates for loans for key industries supported by the state will be differentiated, with the actual increase in loan interest rates being less than 2 percentage points.

Third, differentiated interest rates will be implemented. For 13 industries included in the state plan, such as energy, transportation, communications, and part of the raw materials industry, as well as for the basic construction loans of the salt and agricultural industries, differentiated interest rates will be implemented. The specific method is that, based on the adjusted normal fixed asset loan interest rate level, the People's Bank will determine the industries for which the loan interest rate will be floated downward each year according to the state's industrial policy and industry planning, with a downward float range of 10-20%; individual loan projects, with the approval of the State Council, can be floated downward by 30%.

To support the export of products and earn foreign exchange, the interest rate for loans for the purchase of export products will remain unchanged at the current annual rate of 9.0%; to stabilize market prices, the interest rate for loans for the purchase of grain, cotton, and oil will also remain unchanged at the current annual rate of 9.0%.

Fourth, the interest surcharge system for loans will be strictly implemented. To optimize the credit fund structure and improve the economic benefits of loan utilization, the interest surcharge for overdue loans will be increased from the current 20% to 30%; the interest surcharge for loans used for excess inventory and problematic goods will be increased from the current 30% to 50%; the interest surcharge for loans that are misappropriated will be increased from the current 50% to 100%.

In addition, the People's Bank has also made corresponding adjustments to the deposit and loan interest rates of various financial institutions.

　　扩大存款　抑制需求　稳定经济
    人民银行２月１日起调整存贷款利率    
    存款利率平均提高３．０６个百分点
  　贷款利率按产业政策有高有低
    本报１月２１日讯  记者刘霄报道：中国人民银行新闻发言人今日宣布，经国务院批准，该行决定从２月１日起调整各项存贷款利率。
    这位发言人说，去年９月１日曾对存贷款利率作过调整，并于９月１０日宣布对三年期以上定期储蓄存款实行保值。这些措施对稳定经济、稳定金融、扩大银行存款，抑制资金需求起到了良好的作用，在一定程度上保护了储户利益，受到了广大人民群众的热烈欢迎。
    这次利率调整的主要内容是：
    第一，提高城乡居民和企事业单位定期存款利率，对三年期以上储蓄存款继续实行保值。半年定期存款由现行年利率６．４８％调高到年利率９．０％；一年期存款由现行年利率８．６４％调高到年利率１１．３４％；二年期存款由现行年利率９．１８％调到１２．２４％；三年期存款由现行年利率９．７２％调到年利率１３．１４％；五年期存款由现行年利率１０．８％调到１４．９４％；八年期存款由现行年利率１２．４２％调到年利率１７．６４％。各档次存款利率平均提高幅度为３．０６个百分点。对城乡居民三年期以上的储蓄存款继续实行保值，即在调整后各档次利率的基础上再加保值贴补率。如果物价降到调整后的利率水平以下时，仍按调整后的利率付息。
    银行办理的零存整取、存本取息、整存零取、定活两便以及华侨人民币储蓄存款的利率均相应提高。
    第二，提高贷款利率。存款利率提高后再加上对三年期以上储蓄存款实行保值，银行的利息支出大幅度增加，贷款利率也必须相应提高。流动资金贷款由现行年利率９．０％提高到１１．３４％，提高２．３４个百分点，与一年期存款利率持平。但是，一年期以下的贷款利率都低于这个水平；另外，对粮、棉、油和外贸产品收购贷款利率、扶贫专项贷款利率这次不上调，对国家重点支持的行业实行区别利率，贷款利率实际提高幅度在２个百分点以下。
    第三，实行差别利率。对列入国家计划内的能源、交通、通信和一部分原材料工业等１３个行业，对盐业、农业的基本建设银行贷款利率，实行差别利率。具体办法是，在调整后的正常固定资产贷款利率水平上，人民银行根据国家产业政策和行业规划，每年确定贷款利率向下浮动的行业，下浮幅度为１０—２０％；个别贷款项目经国务院批准可以向下浮动３０％。
    为支持产品出口创汇，对出口产品收购贷款利率仍维持现行年利率９．０％不变；为稳定市场物价，银行对粮、棉、油收购贷款利率也不作调整，仍为年利率９．０％。
    第四，严格贷款的加息制度。为优化信贷资金结构，提高贷款运用的经济效益，对逾期贷款加息由现行的２０％提高到３０％；对超储积压和有问题商品占用的贷款加息由现行的３０％提高到５０％；对挤占挪用的贷款加息由现行的５０％提高到１００％。
    此外，人民银行对各金融机构的存、贷款利率也作了相应调整。
