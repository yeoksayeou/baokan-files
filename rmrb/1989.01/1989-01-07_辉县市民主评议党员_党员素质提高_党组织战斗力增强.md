Since the establishment of the democratic evaluation of party members system in Huixian City, Henan Province, the quality of party members has significantly improved. The vast majority of those evaluated as basically unqualified have transformed into basically qualified party members. The combat effectiveness of party organizations at all levels has been notably enhanced.

The first democratic evaluation of party members in Huixian City began in December 1987. During the evaluation, party members voluntarily compared themselves against party standards, reflecting on their work, thoughts, discipline, and style. They strictly accepted the party organization's assessment and the evaluation from fellow party members and the masses, receiving a vivid education on party standards. Many party members channeled the enthusiasm and energy sparked by the democratic evaluation into the construction of both material and spiritual civilization.

Zhang Dexiang, a party member from Songzhangmu Village in Jucheng Township, became wealthy by cultivating seedless watermelons. He did not forget the masses and last year, he personally funded six training sessions, enabling over 200 people to learn the techniques of seedless watermelon cultivation and find their path to prosperity. According to statistics, 412 party members voluntarily returned overdue public funds totaling 396,200 yuan; 518 individuals returned excess residential land amounting to 12,650 square meters; 736 people voluntarily paid back their quota of grain, totaling 139,000 kilograms; and party members subject to family planning all adopted contraceptive measures.

After the evaluation, party members actively worked to benefit the masses and do practical work, creating a widespread trend. According to statistics, last year, party members in the city repaired and rebuilt 42,500 meters of irrigation canals, 27,000 meters of roads, and dug 354 wells. They also established 2,120 small groups for public security, mediation, assistance, poverty alleviation, information, and scientific and technological services.

During the evaluation process, some issues within the leadership of grassroots party organizations were exposed. While the Huixian Municipal Party Committee focused on helping, educating, adjusting, and assigning tasks to the grassroots party branch leadership, they also introduced a competitive mechanism during the branch elections. Currently, the vast majority of grassroots branches can effectively play their role as fortresses of combat. The masses in the Municipal Radio and Television Bureau criticized issues such as the misuse of public funds for extravagant banquets and the use of public vehicles for personal matters. The party branch of the bureau formulated measures for integrity, saving over 2,000 yuan in reception expenses last year compared to the previous year.

　　辉县市民主评议党员
    党员素质提高　党组织战斗力增强
    本报讯  河南省辉县市建立民主评议党员制度的一年来，全市党员的素质明显提高，被评为基本不合格的党员绝大多数转变为基本合格党员，各级党组织的战斗力明显增强。
    辉县市第一次民主评议党员是从１９８７年１２月开始的。广大党员在评议中自觉对照党员标准，从工作、思想、纪律、作风等方面进行自我总结，严格接受党组织的考核和党员群众的评议，受到一次生动的党员标准教育。许多党员把民主评议焕发出的热情和干劲投入到两个文明建设中。占城乡宋张木村党员张德祥，培育无籽西瓜致富后不忘群众，去年自费办了６期学习班，使２００余人学会了无籽西瓜栽培技术，走上了致富之路。据统计，全市有４１２名党员主动归还拖欠公款３９６２００元；５１８人退还多占宅基地１２６５０平方米；７３６人主动补交订购粮１３９０００公斤；应计划生育的党员均采取了节育措施。
    评议后，党员为群众谋福利、办实事蔚然成风。据统计，去年全市党员为群众新修和复修水渠４２５００米，修路２７０００米，打井３５４眼，还建立了２１２０个党员治安、民调、帮教、扶贫、信息、科技服务小组。
    在评议党员过程中，也暴露出基层党组织领导班子存在的一些问题。辉县市委在抓好对基层党支部班子帮助、教育、调整和派任的同时，还结合支部换届，积极引入竞争机制，对９６１个基层支部实行差额选举。目前，绝大多数基层支部能较好地发挥战斗堡垒作用。市广播电视局群众在评议中对局里滥用公款大吃大喝，用公车办私事等问题提出尖锐批评。局机关党支部制定廉洁措施，去年全局招待费用比上年节约２０００余元。
