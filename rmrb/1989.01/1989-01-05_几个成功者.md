Title: A Few Successful Individuals

	Several prominent literary figures sat together, maintaining a prolonged silence. They carried their own pride and self-satisfaction, as each name bore a unique honor. Yet, none could erect their radiant image as a monument in others' hearts. Each person pondered deeply over this.

	The wispy smoke from cigarettes and the aimless chatter gently filled the air.

	Suddenly, one person pointed to another and said, "He used to suffer a lot in the past!" The person then began to recount his past, his slightly melancholic tone awakening each sealed memory.

	The cold atmosphere, once ignited, burned fiercely: memories of being sent to cow sheds for re-education, wandering in desolate wastelands, being separated from spouses and children, and experiencing the destruction of families; perhaps even teetering on the brink of crime. The yearning to escape yet the inability to do so—these hardships have now transformed into elegance, nonchalance, and a maturity that commands admiration.

	Oh, the symphony of hardship! So much bitterness, sweetness, and sorrow, so much genuine emotion, all expressed in boundless outpouring and a touch of artistic exaggeration, showing uniqueness.

	Past pain can serve as a historical lesson, or it can be a form of entertainment. If it is merely savored, even the deepest hardship cannot reveal much depth.

	Successful individuals have the right to speak freely, but ordinary people are not willing to endure more hardship. If today were to become yesterday, or if tomorrow were worse than yesterday (of course, this is just a bold assumption, and perhaps it can be confidently asserted that it will never become a reality), some literary figures' responses might still be a mystery.

　　几个成功者
    冯秋子
    几个颇有建树的文人围坐一起，长时间地守着一个矜持。
    他们带着各自的骄傲、自豪，因为每个名字上都刻写着殊荣。但是谁也无法将自己光辉的形象构筑成他人心目中的丰碑，每个人都为此苦思冥想。
    袅袅升腾的香烟和不着边际的话语轻轻弥漫着。
    突然，一个人指着另一个人说：他过去可没少吃苦啊！于是那人开始讲从前，略带伤感的语调唤醒了每个尘封的记忆。
    冰冷的气氛一经点燃便是热烈的燃烧：曾经牛棚改造，曾经荒原流浪，曾经妻离子散，曾经家破人亡；也许还沦落到犯罪的边缘。渴望摆脱而又难以摆脱的苦难，如今都已演变成风度、潇洒和足以使人仰慕的成熟。
    苦难交响诗啊！多少酸甜苦辣，多少真情实感，都在无尽的挥洒与些微的艺术夸张之中表现着与众不同。
    远去的痛苦可以成为历史的明鉴，也可以成为一种消遣，如果仅是玩味，再深重的苦难也发掘不出多少内涵。
    成功者自有权利侃侃而谈，普通人却不情愿再吃苦受罪。假如今天又变成昨天，或者明天还不如昨天（当然这只是个大胆假设，或许可以肯定永远不会变为现实），某些文人的回答可能还是个悬念。
