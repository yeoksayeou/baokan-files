In Liaoning, when it comes to retired comrades nurturing, caring for, supporting, and helping new cadres, everyone from top to bottom praises the former provincial Party Committee First Secretary Guo Feng, Li Huang, and the former Shenyang Municipal Party Committee First Secretary Li Tao. Recently, the reporter interviewed Comrade Li Tao and deeply felt that their unyielding integrity is a precious asset of the Party.

In Li Tao's study filled with the scent of books, I asked him: After retired comrades step down from their leadership positions, how do they help the new leadership and cadres maintain clean governance? The energetic Li Tao summed it up in one phrase: Personal example is key.

Li Tao introduced the main cadres involved in the two leadership transitions in Liaoning in 1983 and 1985, as well as the situation of personnel exchanges, and said: Some retired comrades are still on the front lines, but Guo Feng, Li Huang, and I have completely retired and hold no positions. (Guo Feng is a member of the Central Advisory Commission, and Li Tao is a member of the National Committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference.) After retiring, we all declared that we would not engage in backdoor operations or interfere with the work of the new leadership. I handed over the keys to my office to my successor Li Changchun as soon as the Party Congress ended.

We have no positions, but we still want to play a role. This is a new problem, and we mainly rely on our actions to influence and remind new cadres.

During the 40th anniversary celebration of the liberation of the Northeast, a city invited me and some other retired comrades to participate in the commemorative activities. Some retired comrades wanted to buy locally produced color TVs, which were in short supply. The city, to accommodate the retired comrades, allowed each to buy a locally produced color TV at the factory price. Many retired comrades did not buy one. Neither did I. To be honest, this is neither embezzlement nor bribery; it's not a big deal. But I believe that, in terms of integrity, it is not appropriate. As retired cadres, why seek such small advantages? Leaders should not enjoy special privileges! We should think about why ordinary people and ordinary cadres cannot buy them?

At this point, Comrade Li Tao became emotional and said: Why is the Party's prestige not as high now? Why does the Party's image among the people not compare to the past? It is because some leading organs and cadres do not consider the impact and do not have strict requirements for themselves. Some leading cadres are themselves honest, but they do not have strict requirements for their staff and family members, causing a bad influence.

He took a long drag on his cigarette and continued emotionally: "Nowadays, there are strong trends of personal connections and networks in society. No one from my hometown comes to ask me for favors. How do I avoid it? I simply do not do it! If you do it for one or two people, open a small gap, they will all come, and you won't be able to stop them. If you turn away two or three, the rest won't come anymore. That's my experience."

"My driver and secretary, as soon as they come, I announce to them: You cannot use my name to do things for yourselves! You also cannot use my name to do things that should not be done! I want my reputation! You can go to the provincial Party Committee to ask about my driver and secretary. My children are all teachers, ordinary cadres, engineers. Guo Feng's children are also ordinary cadres; two of them are still workers..."

"All of the above are matters of conduct," Li Tao said, changing the subject, "The new leadership and cadres have a more important issue, which is the issue of personnel selection, that is, do not use personal connections to select people! The power to appoint personnel must be in the hands of the Party Committee, and the organizational department should be responsible for assessment. Now there is a very abnormal phenomenon: it is said that this cadre is someone's person, that cadre is someone's person; many young cadres look for backers. I say, young cadres must avoid looking for backers, otherwise, big problems may arise!"

Comrade Li Tao said: The task of leadership transition in Liaoning has been basically completed. For the newly promoted cadres, the original provincial Party Committee leadership all acted out of public spirit. Who to promote and who not to promote, there was no hint from the Central Committee, and we old core members also did not hint. None of them had any historical connection with us. Li Tieying, Li Guixian, Li Changchun, Li Zemin, we did not know them before; they were all recommended by various parties and assessed by the organizational department before we made contact. Of course, whether the new cadres are all morally and talented is not certain, and there may be problems in the future. Therefore, after the new leadership was established, there were not many rumors in society, and the internal relations of the leadership were also relatively normal.

Comrade Li Tao finally mentioned that new cadres do not conduct criticism and self-criticism within the Party correctly, which is a common phenomenon. At this point, he stood up and said loudly: Now, Party life meetings are nothing like life meetings! The important content of life meetings is to conduct criticism and self-criticism, but now there is basically no such content in Party life meetings. It's all about how good you are, how good I am, how good everyone is. At most, there are some "hopes" and "suggestions." How can this be?

The three-hour conversation barely gave me a chance to speak. Comrade Li Tao ended my interview with a heavy exclamation mark: "Now, I am not worried about the price problem, but whether the Party will become corrupt!"

### 浩然正气话清廉——访李涛同志

　　浩然正气话清廉
    ——访李涛同志
    本报记者  尹品端
    在辽宁，提起退下来的老同志对新干部的培养、爱护、支持和帮助，上上下下对原省委第一书记郭峰、李荒和原沈阳市委第一书记李涛无不啧啧称颂；记者最近采访了李涛同志，深感他们身上的凛然正气，正是党的宝贵财富。
    在李涛同志充溢着书香气的家庭接待室里，我问他：老同志从领导岗位退下来以后，如何帮助新班子、新干部为政清廉。精力充沛的李涛同志一言以蔽之：身教是重点。
    李涛同志如数家珍似地介绍了１９８３年、１９８５年辽宁两次新老交替的主要领导干部名单及上下进出交流的情况以后说：退下来的老同志，有少数还在一线任职，我、郭峰、李荒是一退到底，什么职务也没有。（郭峰同志任中顾委委员，李涛同志是全国政协常委。）我们退下来后，都表示不搞幕后指挥，不干扰新班子的工作，有时间就下去调查一些有兴趣的问题。原来的办公室，我是一开完党代会便把钥匙交给了接班人李长春。
    我们没有职务，还要发挥点作用，这是一个新问题，主要靠我们的行动去影响、提醒新干部。
    东北解放４０周年纪念时，一个市请了我和其他一些老同志去参加纪念活动。有的老同志要买当地产的彩电，这些东西是紧俏货，市里为照顾老同志，让每个老同志可以出厂价买当地产的一台彩电。不少老同志没有买。我也没有买。就事论事，这既不是贪污，也不是受贿，不是什么大问题。但我认为，从廉洁来讲，是不应该的。作为老干部，讨那么点便宜干什么？领导干部就不应该享受特权！要想想老百姓为什么买不到？一般干部为什么买不到？
    说到这里，李涛同志激动地说：为什么现在我们党的威信不那么高？为什么党在群众中的形象不如过去好？就是因为我们有些领导机关、领导干部不考虑影响，对自己要求不严格。也有的领导干部本身还是廉洁的，只是对身边工作人员和家属子女要求不严，造成不好的影响。
    他长长地吸了一口烟，仍很动情地说：“现在社会上人情风、关系网等情况比较厉害，我的老家没有人来求我办事的。你说怎么摆脱的？一律不办！给一个两个办了，开一两个口子，就都来了，堵也堵不住，来一个顶一个，顶回去两三个，其余的就不会再来了，这就是我的经验。”
    “我的司机、秘书一来，我就向他们宣布，你们不能借我的名义为自己办事！也不能借我的名义代我办不应该办的事！我要我的名誉！你可以到省委机关去打听，看我的司机、秘书怎么样？我的孩子都是教员、普通干部、工程师，郭峰同志的孩子也都是普通干部，有两个现在仍当工人……”
    “以上都是作风问题”，李涛同志话锋一转，接着说：“新班子、新干部还有一个更重要的问题是用人问题，就是不要用私人，不要以私人关系用人！用人权必须掌握在党委手里，由组织部门去考核。现在有一种很不正常的现象，好说这个干部是谁的人，那个干部是谁的人；不少年轻干部找后台。我说呀！年轻干部切忌找后台，弄不好要出大问题！”
    李涛同志说：辽宁省新老交替的任务基本完成了，对新提上来的干部，原来的省委领导都是出于公心，提谁不提谁，中央没有暗示，我们老的核心成员也没有暗示，没有一个是与我们有什么历史关系的。李铁映、李贵鲜、李长春、李泽民等过去我们都不认识，都是经过各方推荐、组织部门考核定下来后才接触的。当然，新干部是否个个都德才兼备，也不一定，今后也难免。因此，新班子组建以后，社会上说三道四的不多，班子内部关系也比较正常。
    李涛同志最后提到，新干部在党内正确地开展批评与自我批评做得比较差，这是一个普遍现象。说到这里，他腾地站起来大声地说：现在的党组织生活会哪像什么生活会，完全是官样文章！生活会的重要内容是开展批评和自我批评，但现在的党组织生活会基本没有这个内容，都是你好，我好，大家好，顶多提个“希望”、“建议”。这怎么行？
    三个多小时的谈话，李涛同志几乎没有让人插嘴的机会，他以“现在我忧心的不是物价问题，而是党会不会腐败的问题！”这样一个重重的惊叹号结束了我的采访。
