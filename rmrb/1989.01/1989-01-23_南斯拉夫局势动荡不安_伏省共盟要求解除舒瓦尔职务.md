Yugoslavia's Situation is Turbulent
Voivodina League of Communists Demands Removal of Shuvard's Position

	BEIJING, Jan. 21 (Xinhua) — The chairman of the Central Committee of the League of Communists of Yugoslavia, Shuvard, pointed out that the internal tensions in Yugoslavia are increasing, and most people are increasingly worried about the future of Yugoslavia.

	BEIJING, Jan. 20 (Xinhua) — The extraordinary congress of the League of Communists of Voivodina Autonomous Province decided on the evening of January 20 to request the Central Committee of the League of Communists of Yugoslavia to remove Shuvard from his position as chairman of the Central Committee of the League of Communists of Yugoslavia.

	The decision stated that an "unprincipled political alliance" has been established within the highest leadership of the League of Communists, and Shuvard's participation in this alliance "has had a decisive impact on further damaging the unity of the League of Communists."

	The decision criticized Shuvard for playing a role in "opposing the Serbian people and the Montenegrin people, and opposing the Macedonian people and the Serbian people" through his words and deeds. It believed that Shuvard bears the greatest responsibility for the political decisions on the Kosovo issue not being implemented in a timely manner.

	During the two-day congress, many representatives sharply criticized and accused Shuvard.

	In October last year, Shuvard had publicly criticized the leadership of the Serbian Republic for not strongly condemning remarks attacking Tito. Since then, Serbian newspapers have begun to criticize Shuvard by name.

	However, at the same time, the veterans' organizations of the Croatian Republic, Bosnia and Herzegovina Republic expressed their firm support for Shuvard, believing that he is a leader advocating reform and implementing the policies of Yugoslavia.

　　南斯拉夫局势动荡不安
    伏省共盟要求解除舒瓦尔职务
    据新华社贝尔格莱德１月２１日电  南共联盟中央主席团主席舒瓦尔指出，南国内的紧张局势在增长，大多数人越来越为南斯拉夫的命运担心。
    新华社贝尔格莱德１月２０日电　南斯拉夫伏伊伏丁那自治省共盟非常代表会议１月２０日晚作出决定，要求南共联盟中央主席团解除舒瓦尔担任的南共联盟中央主席团主席的职务。
    决定称南共联盟最高领导中“建立了无原则的政治联盟”，舒瓦尔参加了这一联盟，这“对南共联盟的团结进一步遭到破坏具有决定性的影响”。
    决定指责舒瓦尔以自己的言行“扮演了使塞尔维亚人民和黑山人民对抗、又使马其顿人民和塞尔维亚人民对抗的角色”，认为舒瓦尔对解决科索沃问题的政治决策迟迟不能贯彻落实负有最大的责任。
    在两天的大会发言中，不少代表对舒瓦尔提出了尖锐的批评和指责。
    去年１０月，舒瓦尔曾公开批评塞尔维亚共和国的领导人对攻击铁托的言论谴责不力。从那时起，塞尔维亚的报刊就开始点名批评舒瓦尔。
    但与此同时，克罗地亚共和国、波斯尼亚和黑塞哥维那共和国的老战士组织则表示坚决支持舒瓦尔，认为他是主张实行改革、执行南斯拉夫方针的领导人。
