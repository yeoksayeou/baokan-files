Prime Minister Benazir Bhutto met with Soviet First Deputy Foreign Minister Vorontsov this morning at the Prime Minister's office. Vorontsov handed over a personal letter from Gorbachev to Bhutto.

During the meeting, Vorontsov conveyed the Soviet government and leadership's congratulations to the Pakistani People's Party for its victory in the elections and to Bhutto for becoming the Prime Minister. He expressed the willingness to develop bilateral relations between the Soviet Union and Pakistan, strengthen economic and trade ties, and assist Pakistan in expanding the Karachi Steel Mill and other construction projects.

In his letter to Bhutto, Gorbachev stated that Bhutto's appointment as the Prime Minister of Pakistan provides an opportunity to restore and develop Soviet-Pakistani relations to the level they were at during the time of the late Prime Minister Bhutto. Gorbachev also hoped that the Pakistani government would play an active role in politically resolving the Afghanistan issue. The Soviet government also extended an invitation to Bhutto to visit the Soviet Union. Bhutto thanked the Soviet government and leadership for their congratulations and economic aid to Pakistan. She stated that after the peaceful resolution of the Afghanistan issue, bilateral relations between Pakistan and the Soviet Union would further develop.

This afternoon, Vorontsov held a press conference at the Pakistani Ministry of Foreign Affairs, focusing on the Afghanistan issue.

Vorontsov reiterated that the Soviet Union would adhere to the Geneva Accords and complete the withdrawal of troops by February 15. Regarding the peaceful resolution of the Afghanistan issue, he said that the proposal by the resistance forces to establish a broad-based consultative parliament to form a new government is a positive step, but it must include the participation of the People's Democratic Party of Afghanistan. According to the Geneva Accords, the government led by this party is one of the parties to resolving the Afghanistan issue. Only with the participation of this party can it be called broad-based. He criticized the resistance forces for not accepting the proposal by the Soviet Union and the Kabul government to cease fire from January 1 of this year, stating that they do not want to stop the bloodshed of the Afghan people, as the Soviet army is no longer participating in combat. He hoped that the leaders of the resistance forces would gradually become more realistic and rational and eventually return to the negotiating table. He stated that the Soviet Union has invited the leaders of the resistance forces to hold negotiations in Moscow.

　　贝·布托总理接见苏副外长沃龙佐夫
    沃龙佐夫举行记者招待会谈阿富汗问题
    本报伊斯兰堡１月７日电  记者任毓骏报道：巴基斯坦总理贝·布托今天上午在总理府接见了苏联第一副外长沃龙佐夫，沃龙佐夫向贝·布托递交了戈尔巴乔夫的亲笔信。
    会见时，沃龙佐夫向贝·布托转达了苏联政府和领导人对巴人民党在大选中获胜和贝·布托就任政府总理表示祝贺，并表示愿意发展苏巴双边关系，加强经贸联系，帮助巴基斯坦扩建卡拉奇钢铁厂和其他建设项目。
    戈尔巴乔夫在致贝·布托的信中说，贝·布托就任巴政府总理为苏巴关系恢复和发展到已故总理布托时代的水平提供了可能。戈尔巴乔夫还希望巴基斯坦政府在政治解决阿富汗问题上发挥积极作用。苏联政府还向贝·布托发出了访苏邀请。贝·布托感谢苏联政府和领导人的祝贺及对巴基斯坦的经济援助，她表示，待阿富汗问题和平解决后，巴苏双边关系将得到进一步发展。
    今天下午，沃龙佐夫在巴基斯坦外交部举行记者招待会，着重谈阿富汗问题。
    沃龙佐夫重申，苏联将遵照日内瓦协议在２月１５日完成撤军。关于阿富汗问题的和平解决，他说，抵抗力量提议建立一个基础广泛的协商性议会以组建新政府，这是积极步骤，但必须有阿富汗人民民主党参加。因为根据日内瓦协议，该党领导的政府是解决阿富汗问题的一方。只有该党参加，才能称之为基础广泛。他指责抵抗力量不接受苏联和喀布尔政府提出的从今年１月１日停火的建议是不愿意停止阿富汗人流血，因为苏军事实上已不参加作战。他希望抵抗力量领导人逐步变得现实和理智，最终回到谈判桌上来。他表示，苏联已向抵抗力量领导人发出在莫斯科举行谈判的邀请。
