	80% of mentally disabled children are caused by human factors, according to a survey by the Child Growth and Development and Intelligence Research Center at Hangzhou University. Experts call on the whole society to strengthen the work of eugenics, child-rearing, and education to reduce and avoid the occurrence of mentally disabled children.

	Researchers used questionnaires and individual interviews to investigate the causes of mental disability in some children. They found that the main factors leading to mental disability in children are: pregnant women contracting diseases or taking medication indiscriminately, midwives' lack of skilled delivery techniques causing fetal injury, improper care and lack of early education for infants and young children, etc.

	Experts point out that the large number of mentally disabled children has become a major obstacle to improving the quality of China's population. Lack of scientific knowledge about childbirth is the fundamental reason for the occurrence of mentally disabled children. Young couples in urban and rural areas, especially in rural areas, lack basic understanding of premarital knowledge, sexual knowledge, family planning knowledge, and eugenics, child-rearing, and education knowledge. Some parents emphasize work, production, and business, neglecting the upbringing of their children. Some parents lock their young children at home all day, or even tie them up in the house, letting them live with chickens, dogs, pigs, and rabbits, and providing only food without any care. As a result, the development of children's senses, perception, memory, thinking, and language is affected, leading to developmental delays.

	Experts suggest strengthening the propaganda and research of eugenics, child-rearing, and education, and setting up evening schools for newlyweds to teach relevant knowledge, and providing a series of services for marriage, pregnancy, childbirth, and child-rearing. They also suggest that the "Eugenics Law" be promulgated as soon as possible to implement pre-marital and pre-natal examination systems.

　　弱智儿八成由人为所致
    杭州一项调查揭示优生优育优教重要性
    新华社杭州１月１７日电  （记者唐庆忠、实习生慎海雄）据杭州大学儿童生长发育和智能研究中心提供的调查表明：８０％以上的弱智儿童是人为因素造成的。有关专家呼吁全社会加强优生优育优教工作，减少和避免弱智儿童的产生。
    研究人员采取问卷与个别谈访相结合的办法，对一些弱智儿童的致病原因作了较为详尽的调查。发现导致儿童弱智的因素主要是：孕妇染病或胡乱服药、助产士接生技术不娴熟使胎儿产伤、婴幼儿抚养失当和缺乏早期教育等。
    专家们指出，弱智儿童的大批出现已成为提高我国人口素质的一大障碍。缺乏科学的生育知识，是形成弱智儿童最根本的原因。各地城乡特别是农村的青年夫妇，对新婚知识、性知识、计划生育知识、优生优教优育知识缺乏基本了解。一些家长片面强调工作、生产、经营忙，无心教养孩子。个别父母把幼儿整天锁在家中，甚至捆绑在屋里，让孩子与鸡、狗、猪、兔为伍，除给予喂食外，无人管教，结果影响了孩子感觉、知觉、记忆、思维、语言的形成和发展，造成发育迟滞。
    专家们建议，加强优生优育优教的宣传和研究，为新婚夫妇开设业余学校，传授有关知识，并提供婚、孕、生、育的系列化服务；尽快颁布《优生法》，推行婚前、产前的检查制度。
