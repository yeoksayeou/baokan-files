The Soviet and American divers split the honors in today's third day of competition at the second London International Diving Championships.

The Soviet Union's Lyubov Borodulina won the women's springboard event with a score of 503.79 points, securing the championship. Her teammate, Elena Ivanova, finished third with 451.86 points. The silver medal in the women's springboard event went to Canadian Mary Woznowski.

The men's platform event saw an unexpected outcome. The audience had high hopes for China's 14-year-old prodigy Zhou Yilin, who performed exceptionally well and led the scoring throughout the competition. However, a mistake in the final round cost him the victory, and he finished second with 547.32 points. The gold medal was taken by American rookie Scott Donie, who scored 575.40 points. Donie is considered the best American diver since the two-time Olympic champion Greg Louganis retired. West Germany's Wilfried Mayer finished third with 502.77 points.

　　伦敦跳水赛苏美平分秋色
    新华社伦敦１月１４日电 苏联选手和美国选手今天在这里进行的第二届伦敦国际跳水赛第三天的比赛中，分别摘走了女子跳板跳水和男子跳台跳水桂冠。
    在女子跳板决赛中，苏联女将柳波娃·博罗杜莉娜以５０３．７９分成绩登上冠军宝座。她的队友叶莲娜·伊万诺娃以４５１．８６分名列第三。女子跳板的亚军被加拿大姑娘玛丽·沃兹沃思夺走。
    男子跳台冠军的归属有些出人意料。观众普遍看好中国１４岁的小将周义林，他在比赛中表现出色，得分一路领先。但在最后关头因失误而功败垂成，仅以５４７．３２分居第二位。男子跳台冠军被美国新秀斯科特·多尼夺走。多尼被认为是自两届奥运会双料冠军洛加尼斯退役后美国最优秀的选手，他今天的得分是５７５．４０分。联邦德国的维尔弗雷德·迈尔以５０２．７７分名列第三。
