The world is currently facing the second global environmental wave since the 1950s. Environmental issues have become a hot topic for leaders of all countries. Global action to protect the environment is an irreversible historical trend. This was pointed out by Guo Ge Ping, Director of the National Environmental Protection Agency, during an interview.

The first environmental wave occurred in the 1950s and 1960s. At that time, environmental pollution in industrialized countries reached a severe level, directly threatening people's lives and safety, becoming a major social issue that affected economic development. Against this historical backdrop, the United Nations held the "Human Environment Conference" in Stockholm, Sweden. Guo Ge Ping, who attended this conference, believes that this conference was a milestone in humanity's understanding and improvement of the environment.

The second wave began in the early 1980s. This wave is accompanied by environmental pollution and large-scale ecological destruction. People are concerned about issues that have a wide impact and severe consequences, mainly acid rain, ozone layer depletion, and the "greenhouse effect." These problems seriously threaten human survival and development, becoming major concerns for countries around the world. The global climate change conference held in Hamburg last November pointed out that if the "greenhouse effect" is not stopped, the world will be in grave danger. Former German Chancellor Willy Brandt called for industrial societies to implement "ecological modernization"; the low-lying island nation of the Maldives faces imminent disaster due to rising sea levels from global warming, and its leaders are urgently seeking a way out.

Old environmental problems are being controlled or solved, but new environmental problems are emerging. Guo Ge Ping compared the two environmental waves. In the previous wave, the focus was on localized environmental pollution problems, with fewer pollution sources, and the causes could be traced. Although environmental pollution had a significant impact on human health and caused economic losses, it was mainly confined to a factory, region, or country. As long as the polluted factory, region, or country took decisive measures to control the pollution, it could be resolved. In this wave, the pollution range is vast, with numerous and diverse pollution sources, widespread distribution, and varied origins—from economic activities and daily life, from developed countries and developing countries. It poses a threat to the entire global environment on which humanity depends. This threat is unavoidable and has a fatal impact on humanity. The nature and scope have undergone fundamental changes.

During the first environmental wave, China lacked understanding of environmental issues, resulting in missed opportunities and the creation of a severe environmental pollution situation that is difficult to reverse. How will China handle this wave? Last December, during a visit by the British Environment Minister, this question was raised. Director Guo Ge Ping responded that China is highly concerned about global environmental issues. China has a large population and limited arable land, making the protection of grain production a long-term strategic task. If the "greenhouse effect" leads to increased natural disasters and reduced grain production, it poses a major threat to China. Additionally, China has 18,000 kilometers of coastline. If sea levels rise due to global warming, many low-lying, economically developed regions will be submerged; if the ozone layer is depleted, human health will be severely affected. Therefore, China's representatives have expressed a positive attitude on this issue at the United Nations.

Guo Ge Ping said that environmental issues are constantly evolving, and humanity's understanding and prevention strategies for environmental issues are also evolving. He concluded by saying that, of course, truly implementing global action will require a great deal of work.

　　曲格平谈第二次世界环境浪潮
    我国对全球环境问题十分关注   
    温室效应对我国工农业有重大威胁
    本报讯  记者谢联辉报道：世界上正面临着自本世纪５０年代以来出现的第二次环境浪潮，环境问题已成为各国首脑注目的热点问题。全球行动，保护环境，是当今不可逆转的历史趋势。这是国家环保局局长曲格平接受采访时指出的。
    第一次环境浪潮是五六十年代。当时工业发达国家环境污染达到了严重程度，直接威胁人们的生命和安全，成为重大的社会问题，影响了经济的发展。在这种历史背景下，联合国在瑞典的斯德哥尔摩召开了“人类环境会议”。出席过这次会议的曲格平认为，这次会议对人类认识和改善环境来说，是一个里程碑。
    第二次高潮是从８０年代初出现的。这是伴随环境污染和大范围生态破坏出现的一次高潮。人们关心的是一些影响范围大、危害严重的问题，主要有酸雨、臭氧层破坏和“温室效应”。这些问题严重威胁着人类的生存和发展，成为世界各国关注的大问题。去年１１月在汉堡召开的全球气候变化会议指出，如果“温室效应”不被阻止，世界在劫难逃。联邦德国前总理勃兰特，要求工业社会实施“生态现代化”；海拔很低的岛国马尔代夫在气候变暖海平面上升后，将有灭顶之灾，该国首脑已在急切寻求避劫之计。
    老的环境问题被控制或解决，新的环境问题又产生出现。曲格平把这两次环境浪潮作了比较。前次高潮，人们关心的重点是小范围的环境污染问题，污染源比较少，来龙去脉可以查清楚。环境污染对人体健康的影响和造成的经济损失虽然很大，但只是在一个工厂、地区，主要出现在经济发达国家，只要被污染的工厂、地区、国家下决心治理，污染就可以得到控制或解决。而这次高潮，被污染的范围大，污染源和破坏源众多，分布广，来源杂，有来自经济活动的，也有来自日常生活的；既来自经济发达国家，又来自发展中国家，是对人类赖以生存的整个地球环境的危害。这种危害难以回避，对人类具有致命的影响。性质和范围都发生了根本性的变化。
    在第一次环境浪潮时期，由于我国对环境问题还缺乏认识，结果丧失了时机，铸成积重难返的环境污染局面。这次高潮来临，中国将怎么办？去年１２月英国环境大臣访华时曾提出这个问题。曲格平局长当时回答，我国对全球性环境问题十分关注。中国人口众多，人均耕地少，保护粮食生产是长期的战略任务，如果“温室效应”导致自然灾害增加、粮食减产，对我国是重大威胁。此外，中国有１８０００公里的海岸线，海平面如果因气候变暖上升，许多海拔低的工农业发达地区将被淹掉；如果臭氧层耗损破坏，人体健康将遭到危害。因此，中国代表在联大曾就此问题表明了积极态度。
    曲格平说，环境问题在不断发展，人类对环境问题的认识和防治对策也在不断发展。他最后说，当然，真正实行全球行动，还需要做大量的工作。
