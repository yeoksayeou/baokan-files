Corporate groups have become the backbone of the electronics industry. The National Electronics Group Product Exhibition and Trade Fair opened today at the Beijing Exhibition Hall. The exhibition showcases products from nearly 1,900 enterprises belonging to 25 electronics groups. The exhibiting enterprises account for approximately 60% of the total number of electronics enterprises.

In recent years, a number of cross-industry, cross-regional, and cross-ownership corporate groups have emerged in the electronics industry. These groups have connected many small and weak enterprises into cohesive units, promoting the optimization of production factors and strengthening the integration of research and production. This has driven the electronics industry towards socialization and specialization. In 1984, a military electronics enterprise located in the mountains of Guizhou Province took the lead in establishing the first electronics industry group—Zhenhua Electronics Industry Company. Now, the company's civilian product output accounts for 90% of its total output. Groups such as Changjiang, Taiji, Changcheng, Changbai, Huaxia, and others, with research institutions as their main bodies, have unique advantages in developing new technologies and products. Groups like Xiongmao, Jinxing, Mudan, Kunlun, Huanghe, and Feiyue, which are built around famous brand products, have seen their famous brand product output increase manifold. The Seagull Group has taken the path of external orientation, establishing cooperative relationships with more than 100 foreign companies, with an annual export earnings of 200 million US dollars.

This exhibition and trade fair displays nearly 16,000 new products in 28 categories, including home appliances such as televisions and audio recorders, as well as investment-type products such as computers, radar, communication equipment, and instruments.

Vice Premier and Minister of the Ministry of Machinery and Electronics Industry, Zhou Jiahuah, attended the opening ceremony. The exhibition and trade fair will conclude on January 24.

　　企业集团成为电子工业中坚力量
    全国电子集团产品展览交易会在京开幕
    本报北京１月１８日讯  企业集团已成为电子工业的中坚力量。今天在北京展览馆开幕的全国电子集团产品展览交易会，展示了２５家电子集团所属的近１９００个企业的产品。参展企业约占电子企业总数的６０％。
    近几年来，一批跨行业、跨地区、跨所有制的企业集团在电子工业崛起，把许多势单力薄的企业连成了群体，促进了生产要素的优化，密切了科研与生产的结合，使电子工业向社会化、专业化方向发展。１９８４年，地处贵州山区的军工电子企业率先成立了电子工业第一个集团——振华电子工业公司。现在这个公司民品产值已占总产值的９０％。长江、太极、长城、长白、华厦等企业集团，以科研单位为主体，在开发新技术、新产品上独具优势。以名牌产品为龙头组建的熊猫、金星、牡丹、昆仑、黄河、飞跃等集团，名牌产品产量成倍增长。赛格集团走外向型之路，已和国外１００多家公司建立了合作关系，年出口创汇额达２亿美元。
    这次展览交易会展出了２８类近１．６万件新产品，有电视机、收录机等家用电器，也有计算机、雷达、通信设备、仪器仪表等投资类产品。
    国务委员兼机械电子工业部部长邹家华出席了开幕式。展览交易会将于１月２４日结束。
