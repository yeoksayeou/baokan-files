Among China's 56 ethnic groups, the Hui people are a very special ethnic group. They are scattered across the vast land of China, always maintaining their independent existence without merging into the Han or other ethnic groups. The Hui are not an "immigrant ethnic group"; they merely have some "foreign blood" in their lineage. Perhaps it is precisely because of this that they are destined to walk a difficult path, never able to enjoy equal status with other ethnic groups in the long feudal society. Due to the discrimination and oppression they have suffered throughout the dynasties, most Hui people are engaged in agriculture or commerce, rarely having the opportunity to receive an education. Scholars and writers are as rare as phoenix feathers and unicorn horns, resulting in the lack of a complete ethnic history monograph and a literary ethnic epic to this day.

Hui female writer Huoda's *The Muslim Funeral* is not a chronicle of the Hui people. The stage for the characters' activities in the book is the modern and contemporary society from 1919 to 1979, but it encompasses, condenses, and reflects the vicissitudes of the Hui people's fate over 700 years, permeating with a strong sense of ethnic consciousness and unique cultural psychology.

A successful novelist should possess the acumen of a thinker, the detachment of a historian, and the erudition of a sociologist. But all of this must be transformed into the flesh and blood of characters and hidden deeply. Characters belong to the author, but thoughts belong to the readers. We must not forget the series of vivid character portraits in *The Funeral*!

Liang Yiqing, the last descendant of the "Jade Liang," possesses extraordinary skills but "only silently toils and guards the small stall of Qijian Pavilion without seeking prosperity," allowing others to exploit, deceive, and discriminate against him without the strength to resist. Perhaps he never thought like his apprentice Han Zichi: Why are we, with yellow skin and black hair, Chinese, inferior to others? Perhaps it is precisely because of this that he is willing to devote his entire life to completing the treasure ship representing Zheng He's voyage to the Western Seas, adding a bit of glory to the Hui people! History did not allow him to fulfill this wish, leaving his work unfinished and his life cut short, only leaving a spiritual call: "God, give me more time!" The fate of the older generation thus ends, never finding an answer until death.

His descendants, in the turmoil of history, underwent tragic combinations and conflicts. In Han Zichi, his apprentice and son-in-law, there is both the strong entrepreneurial spirit given by the capitalist sprouts and the inertia of conformism and compromise given by the semi-feudal, semi-colonial society. He rose from a penniless vagabond to become the famous "Jade King" of Beijing and London, but in the spiritual world, he was as poor as a church mouse, ultimately holding a dying candle in the wind and walking towards death...

Liang Yiqing's two daughters took different paths in their lives. The elder daughter, Junbi, attempted to combine the sanctity of the original teachings with worldly selfishness to prosper the family and bring glory to the ancestors, but the result was the opposite, gaining nothing; the younger daughter, Bingyu, struggled in the tide of the times, seeking a new personality and life, but did not find a true home.

The author "mercilessly" placed the heavy burden of history on a weak girl, Han Xin Yue, aged 17 to 20. The third generation of Qijian Pavilion lived in the 1960s. The confusing mystery of her identity, the heavy religious atmosphere in the family, and the harsh political climate in society forced her to think and seek: How should one walk the path of life, and what is the future of the Hui people? The author did not answer her; only history and the future could. The author buried her with deep affection, hoping that new life would be born from that mound of earth.

The author, with a pen that possesses magical charm, wrote about religion, whose immense appeal can even transform Han Zichi, a Han orphan, into a devout Muslim. Tuluoye Ding Baba is the representative of this religious spirit, embodying the vast tolerance of Islam and the beautiful qualities of the Hui people's tenacity and unyielding spirit. At the same time, the author, with an artistic method that makes one intoxicated, wrote about culture, giving readers a great spiritual enjoyment, while the "Jade Demon" old man is the embodiment of this culture. The novel is a history of the collision and fusion of Islamic culture and Chinese culture. Both collision and fusion are painful, but they are inevitable.

*The Muslim Funeral* contributes far more than just writing about this collision and fusion, more than just compiling the history of the entire Hui people's past and yesterday. What is even more precious is that the author, with a spirit and courage that transcend ethnicity and history, dares to "examine the father," "examine the mother," and "examine the ancestors," daring to conduct a calm and profound self-examination at the ancestral tomb, focusing on the future of the ethnic group.

Seven hundred years ago, part of the Hui people's blood came from "overseas"; seven hundred years later, including the Hui people, the entire Chinese nation is urgently "moving towards the world." There is no straight path to walk, and the path of history has always been filled with thorns. Carrying a heavy burden to set out and setting out with empty hands will both cause us to collapse on the way before reaching the other shore. "Reconstructing the ethnic soul" is not just a historical choice facing the Hui people. This is the contemplation that *The Muslim Funeral* leaves us with.

### 回族的一曲精神礼赞——读长篇小说《穆斯林的葬礼》

　　回族的一曲精神礼赞
    ——读长篇小说《穆斯林的葬礼》
    高深〔回族〕
    在中国的５６个民族中，回族是一个极其特殊的民族。她散居神州大地，始终保持着自己的独立存在，而不融入汉人或其他民族之中。回族不是“外来民族”，只不过血统中有某些“海外关系”而已。也许正由于此，她才命中注定要走一条艰难的路，在漫长的封建社会中，始终不能享有与其他民族平等的地位。由于历代所遭受的歧视、倾轧，回族当中多数务农或是经商，难以得到受教育的机会，学者、作家如凤毛麟角，以致至今没有一部完整的民族史专著，没有一部文学性民族史诗。
    回族女作家霍达的《穆斯林的葬礼》并不是回族的编年史。书中人物活动的舞台，是从１９１９年到１９７９年这６０年间的现代、当代社会，却包容、浓缩、透视了回族七百年的命运沉浮，渗透了强烈的民族意识和独特的文化心理。
    成功的小说家，应该具备思想家的敏锐、史学家的冷峻和社会学家的渊博。但这一切又必须化为人物的血肉并且深藏不露。人物属于作者，而思想属于读者。我们不能忘记《葬礼》中一系列栩栩如生的人物群像！
    梁亦清，“玉器梁”的最后一代传人，身怀绝技，却“只会默默地埋头苦干、死守奇珍斋的小摊子而不求发达”，一任他人的盘剥、欺诈、歧视而无力反抗。也许，他根本没有像徒弟韩子奇那样想过：同是黄皮肤、黑头发的中国人，为什么自己低人一等啊？也许，他正因为这，才不惜倾毕生心血去完成表现郑和下西洋的宝船，为回民族增添一点光彩！历史没有让他实现这个夙愿，功亏一篑，玉殒人亡，只留下心灵的呼唤：“真主啊，再给我时间！”老一辈的命运就这样画了句号，至死也没有得到答案。
    他的后人在历史的动荡中，进行了悲剧性的组合，也发生了悲剧性的冲突。在徒弟、女婿韩子奇身上，既有资本主义萌芽时期给予他的强烈的事业心冲动，又有半封建半殖民地社会给予他的因循守旧、委曲求全的惰性，他从分文莫名的流浪儿一跃成为名噪京城、蜚声英伦的“玉王”，而在精神世界却一贫如洗，最终手持风中残烛，走向死亡……
    梁亦清的两个女儿在人生旅途中分道扬镳。长女君璧试图把原教的神圣和世俗的自私合而为一，来兴家立业、耀祖光宗，结果事与愿违，一无所获；次女冰玉在时代潮流中搏击，追寻新的人格和人生，也并未找到真正的归宿。
    作者“无情”地把历史的重负压在一个１７岁到２０岁的弱女韩新月身上。奇珍斋的第三代生活在６０年代。扑朔迷离的身世之谜，家庭中浓重的宗教氛围，社会上严酷的政治空气，迫使她去思索、去探求：人生的路该怎么走，回民的明天是什么？作者没有回答她，能够回答她的只有历史和未来。作者满怀深情地埋葬了她，殷切地期望着那一抔黄土中诞生新的生命。
    作者以具有神奇魅力的笔触写了宗教，它的巨大感召力竟然能使韩子奇这个汉人的孤儿最终改造成虔诚的伊斯兰教徒。吐罗耶定巴巴便是这一宗教精神的代表，他的身上集中了伊斯兰教的博大海涵和回民族坚韧不拔、义无反顾的优美素质。作者同时又以令人如醉如痴的艺术手段写了文化，奇石美玉给了读者以极大的精神享受，而“玉魔”老人则是这一文化的化身。小说是一部伊斯兰文化和华夏文化的撞击、融合史。撞击和融合都是痛苦的，但又不可避免。
    《穆斯林的葬礼》的贡献还远远不在于写了这种撞击和融合本身，不在于为整个回民族的前天和昨天修史立传，更为难得的是作者以超越民族、超越历史的气度和胆识去“审父”、“审母”、“审祖”，敢于在祖坟前作冷静深邃的自审，着眼于民族的未来。
    七百年前，回民族的一部分血脉来自“海外”；七百年后，包括回族在内的整个中华民族都在迫切地“走向世界”。没有一条直路可走，历史的道路从来都充满荆棘。背着沉重包袱上路和两手空空地上路，都会使我们在到达彼岸之前就倒毙途中。“重塑民族魂”，当不只是回民族所面临的历史抉择。这就是《穆斯林的葬礼》留给我们的思索。
