Title: Also on the Last Emperor and Hu Shi

The Chinese people love to watch one-sided plays: good people are good through and through, with not a single flaw; bad people are bad through and through, with absolutely no redeeming qualities. The Chinese people also love to cover up for the elderly and the wise: if you want to say someone is good, you can't mention any of their flaws or mistakes, because that would be desecrating the "sages."

Hu Shi made significant contributions to China's New Culture Movement. In the 1950s, a campaign to criticize Hu Shi left him with a tarnished reputation. Now, it is time to reassess him, so there is a complete turnaround. The television series "The Last Emperor" depicts Puyi summoning Hu Shi to the Forbidden City, which was seen by an article titled "From the Last Emperor and Hu Shi" (November 8, 1988, *Dadi* supplement) as "mocking" and "ridiculing" this scholar.

However, the author of the article did not bother to flip through some old books. Lu Xun, as early as October 1931, wrote an essay titled "Knowing is Difficult, Doing is Difficult," which mentioned Hu Shi's visit to the emperor:

"The old tradition in China is that when the emperor is in power or in trouble, he always befriends scholars and literati...

"When the 'Xuantong Emperor' abdicated and found himself with nothing to do, our Dr. Hu Shi once fulfilled this duty.

"After the meeting, it was strange that people first asked how they addressed each other. The doctor said: 'He called me Mr., and I called him Emperor.'

"At that time, it seemed they did not discuss any state affairs, because this 'Emperor' later only wrote a few humorous poems in vernacular Chinese, eventually becoming bored, and was even driven out of the palace. Now he is prosperous, and it is said that he wants to go to the Northeast to be the emperor again..."

According to this, if we are to say "ridiculing the scholar," the source should be Lu Xun. Blaming Puyi and his ghostwriters is unfair to them.

However, Dr. Hu Shi did indeed show great concern for the deposed emperor Puyi. Even with the incident of Puyi being "driven out of the palace" mentioned by Lu Xun, at that time, some idle scholars criticized the "National Army's forced abdication drama, trampling on the spirit of the rule of law, and violating international agreements." "Taking advantage of someone's death, bullying the weak," and so on. Dr. Hu Shi, on the other hand, could not wait to write an open letter to the then Foreign Minister Wang Zhengting, cursing the National Army for not bullying the weak. Then, Dr. Hu Shi went to the temporary residence of the deposed emperor in Beifu, comforting the "Emperor" in every way, and then cursing the National Army again. This incident was even mentioned by the Tianjin *Beiyang Illustrated*, which said Dr. Hu Shi's actions were "despised by scholars." I think the "scholarly opinion" at that time was a product of the patriotic and progressive trend of thought!

A historical television series, in a fragment of the plot, writes about a certain secondary character, which absolutely cannot be a comprehensive evaluation of that character. If it is believed that writing about a character's mistake in a fragment is a complete denial of that character, and therefore it is necessary to fully display the character's historical merits at the same time, this would make it difficult for our film and television directors!

The article also compares the so-called "feudal remnants" Wang Guowei, Liang Qichao, and Yan Fu with the "representative of the bourgeoisie intellectuals" Hu Shi, who "strives to promote democracy and science and opposes feudalism," believing that the latter is "somewhat more progressive." I think this comparison is a mistake of the "habitual analysis method" mentioned in the article, that is, the error of simple class analysis. Putting these old gentlemen together for comparison, without considering their historical environment, this method is not advisable. Moreover, the article says that Liang Qichao "supported Yuan Shikai's restoration of the empire," which is probably not accurate. Liang Qichao did follow Yuan Shikai and even made some mistakes. But when he saw through Yuan Shikai's sinister intentions to restore the empire, after his attempts to dissuade Yuan were rejected, he reversed his pro-Yuan stance and actively participated in the anti-Yuan movement. His famous article "Strange is the So-Called Constitutional Question" caused a national uproar; subsequently, he helped Cai E return to Yunnan in secret, raising the banner of rebellion against Yuan, and finally causing Yuan Shikai to fall. To sum up Liang Qichao's support for Yuan Shikai's restoration of the empire in one sentence seems unfair. Did the author also make the mistake of "because Liang Qichao followed Yuan Shikai, he completely negated everything before and after"?

People are complex. Why does the idea of being good through and through or bad through and through always haunt people's minds like a ghost? Now that we advocate "updating concepts," I think this outdated metaphysics should also be updated.

　　也谈末代皇帝和胡适
    王近庸
    国人总爱看“一边倒”的戏：好人好到底，绝无半点瑕疵；坏人坏到底，肯定一无是处。国人还爱为长者讳，为贤者讳：要说这个人好，他的任何缺点、失误都不能提，一提就是亵渎“圣贤”了。
    胡适是对我国新文化运动有很大贡献的学者。５０年代一场批胡运动，把胡适批得体无完肤，声名狼藉。如今需要再认识了，于是又来个一百八十度大转弯。电视连续剧《末代皇帝》演了溥仪召见胡适进紫禁城，被一篇题为《从末代皇帝与胡适说开去》（１９８８年１１月８日《大地》副刊）的文章认作是“戏弄”、“奚落”了这位大学者。
    然而文章作者未曾多翻一翻早年的书。鲁迅早在１９３１年１０月写的一篇题为《知难行难》的杂文，就提到了胡适博士进宫见溥仪的事：
    “中国向来的老例，做皇帝做牢靠和做倒霉的时候，总要和文人学士扳一下相好……
    “当‘宣统皇帝’逊位逊到坐得无聊的时候，我们的胡适之博士曾经尽过这样的任务。
    “见过以后，也奇怪，人们不知怎的先问他们怎样的称呼，博士曰：‘他叫我先生，我叫他皇上。’
    “那时似乎并不谈什么国家大计，因为这‘皇上’后来不过做了几首打油白话诗，终于无聊，而且还落得一个赶出金銮殿。现在可要阔了，听说想到东三省再去做皇帝呢……”
    据此，要说“奚落大学者”，这根源该是鲁迅。把“罪名”加到溥仪及其捉刀人的头上，未免冤枉了他们。
    然而，胡适博士确曾对逊帝溥仪备加爱护。即以鲁迅所提溥仪被“赶出金銮殷”一事而论，当时有些帮闲文人曾指责“国民军演逼宫恶剧，敝屣法治精神，违背国际信约。”“乘人之丧，凌人之弱”等等。胡适博士则更迫不及待地给当时的外交总长王正廷写了封公开信，大骂国民军，不应欺凌弱者。接着，胡博士又走进逊帝暂居的北府，对“皇上”百般宽慰，并且又把国民军骂了一通。这件事连专谈风月的天津《北洋画报》也曾说胡博士此举，“士论鄙之”。我想当时的“士论”，是爱国进步思潮的产物吧！
    一部历史题材的电视连续剧，在片断情节里写了某个次要人物，绝不可能是对这个人物的全面评价。如果认为在某一片断写了某个人物的失误，就是全盘否定这个人物，因此必须同时也要把这个人物的历史功绩摆够，这岂不难煞了我们的影视编导？
    文章还拿据说是“封建余孽”的王国维、梁启超、严复与“努力提倡民主与科学，反对封建主义”的“资产阶级知识分子代表”胡适相比，认为后者比前者“总要进步一些”。愚以为，这样比，正犯了该文所说的“习惯分析法”，即简单的阶级分析法的错误。把这几位老先生放在一起比，而不顾其所处的历史环境，这比法实不足取。况且文章说梁启超曾“为袁世凯复辟帝制张目”，恐怕这提法也欠准确。梁启超确曾追随过袁世凯，甚至做过一些错事。但当他看穿袁复辟帝制的险恶用心，在对袁进行劝阻遭到拒绝之后，他一反拥袁的立场，积极投身反袁运动之中。他那篇有名的《异哉所谓国体问题》一发表，使全国震动；随后他又帮助蔡锷潜回云南，举起讨袁义旗，终使袁世凯倒台。以梁启超“为袁世凯复辟帝制张目”一言以蔽之，似欠公允。作者在这里是否也犯了因梁曾追随袁世凯，“便将以前和全人一笔抹煞”的毛病呢？
    人是复杂的。要么好到底、要么坏到底的观念为什么总像幽灵一样在人们的头脑里转悠？现在提倡“观念更新”，我看这个陈腐的形而上学也该更一更新了。
