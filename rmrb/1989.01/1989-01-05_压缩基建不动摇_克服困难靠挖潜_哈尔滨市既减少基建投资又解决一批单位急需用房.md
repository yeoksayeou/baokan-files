	Harbin City Reduces Construction Investment While Solving Urgent Housing Needs for Multiple Units

	Xinhua News Agency reporter Zǔ Bǎoguāng and People's Daily reporter Wǔ Péizhēn report: Harbin City is simultaneously compressing ongoing construction projects and conducting a survey to tap into the potential of existing buildings and facilities. This approach has not only reduced construction investment but also enabled the utilization of tens of thousands of square meters of buildings and many idle facilities, addressing a large number of practical difficulties.

		Efforts are being made to tap into the potential of enterprise factories, machinery, and land. To enhance economic development, Harbin City has formulated development plans for 10 key products, including power station equipment, automobiles, flax, and pharmaceuticals. Some of these plans require new land acquisition, factory construction, equipment purchases, and other new investments. For example, the newly established automobile group aims to increase annual production from 20,000 vehicles to 100,000 vehicles, necessitating an additional 120,000 square meters of factory space. They have absorbed two factories that were occupying 740,000 square meters of land and 110,000 square meters of factory space but had no future prospects, thereby revitalizing these two enterprises.

		The development of adult education relies on school adjustments to address the shortage of classrooms, teachers, and funds. The municipal government has adopted three adjustment methods: merging, retaining, and collaborating, to alleviate and resolve various practical difficulties without increasing investment. One cadre school had 6,600 square meters of idle classrooms, while another vocational college repeatedly requested the government to allocate an additional 6 million yuan for classroom expansion. After adjustments, these contradictions have been resolved.

		Party and government office buildings are being redistributed to compress construction investment and rental costs. The municipal party committee and government have proposed that all units should consider the overall situation and coordinate resources. After coordination, the construction of 30,000 square meters of office buildings planned by various units has been halted.

　　压缩基建不动摇　克服困难靠挖潜
    哈尔滨市既减少基建投资又解决一批单位急需用房
    本报讯  新华社记者祖伯光、本报记者武培真报道：哈尔滨市一边压缩基建在建项目，一边对原有房屋设施摸底挖潜，既减少了基建投资，又使数以万平方米计、十万平方米计的房屋及许多闲置设施发挥效用，解决了大量实际困难。
    ——努力挖掘企业厂房、机器设备和地皮的潜力。为增强经济发展后劲，哈市制定了电站设备、汽车、亚麻、医药等１０种拳头产品的发展规划。有的需新征地、建厂房、购设备及增加其它新投入，如新建的汽车集团，要实现国家下达的年产量从２万辆发展到１０万辆的指标，必须增加厂房１２万平方米。他们将两个产品没前途却占地７４万平方米、占厂房１１万平方米的工厂吸收进来，救活了这两家企业。
    ——发展成人教育事业，靠院校调整解决校舍、师资、资金紧缺的矛盾。市府采取合并、保留、联合的三种调整办法，在不增加投资的情况下缓解和解决各种实际困难。有一所干校闲置校舍６６００平方米，而另一所职业高校为增加校舍多次要求政府增拨６００多万元投资。经过调整，这类矛盾得以解决。
    ——对党政机关办公用房进行调剂，压缩建设投资和租房费用。市委市政府提出，各机关要顾全大局，统一调配。经各方协调后，现已停建了一批单位计划兴建的３万平方米的办公用房。
