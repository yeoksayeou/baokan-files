An Unforgettable "Pruning" — Reflections on a Case of Middle School Students Gang Robbery

On the afternoon of September 20, 1988, students Jiang and Wang from Yidu Middle School and Wuxi Middle School in Xinning County, Hunan Province, met and planned to rob a car on the highway after evening self-study. At around 9 PM, Jiang and Wang each called out students Fan, He, and Li, who were usually close to them, from their respective schools. Jiang explained the plan and assigned roles. About ten minutes later, a truck came from the Xinning direction. The students, armed with scissors, stones, sugarcane stalks, and whips, threatened the driver and cargo owner to hand over their money and belongings. Subsequently, they robbed four more vehicles in the same manner. In total, they robbed five times, obtaining 56.06 yuan in cash, one car rearview mirror, four packs of high and medium-grade cigarettes, two packs of cakes, one car cover, and one broken car light. The total value of the cash and items was over 300 yuan. The oldest perpetrator was 19 years old, and the youngest was 15 years old, with an average age of 17.3 years.

On October 26, 1988, the Xinning County Public Security Bureau arrested them according to law. The news spread, causing shock among parents, schools, and society! People were asking: How did they end up on the path of crime? For this, we visited the teachers and students of the two schools.

The investigation results showed that, in addition to the criminals' own desire for enjoyment and thrill-seeking, several issues emerged that deserve serious consideration.

Reflection One: How should school education address the relationship between morality and intelligence? Currently, the situation is that some schools focus solely on raising admission rates, neglecting the education of individuals. The admission rate and academic performance have become the sole criteria for evaluating teachers and students. Students generally complain that there are textbooks for legal knowledge courses but no class time, and these courses are merely nominal.

Reflection Two: How to fulfill the function of family education? The problems reflected in this case are quite serious in this regard. Criminal Zhang, for example, was the apple of his family's eye, especially his grandfather, who indulged him in everything. When Zhang wanted to play cards, his grandfather would take him to the gambling dens. Zhang met Jiang while playing cards and was later recruited by Jiang to participate in the robbery.

Reflection Three: Who is responsible for school security? Primary and secondary schools lack full-time security personnel, and the public security department has not included them in their security management scope. According to reports from Wuxi Middle School, there have been multiple thefts on campus this school year, with stolen cash and items valued at over 2,000 yuan. Criminal Wang, who had previously stolen 350 kilograms of steel and went unnoticed, became even bolder and eventually progressed to gang robbery.

Reflection Four: How to guide students to correctly view thrilling and martial arts films, TV shows, and publications? Contrary to the general lack of legal knowledge, middle school students show a particular interest in martial arts and thrilling action films and publications. A survey of 96 questionnaires showed that 53 students liked martial arts novels and thrilling action films the most. Criminal Fan, after being imprisoned, confessed: "One of the reasons I ended up on the path of crime is that I read many thrilling martial arts novels and watched movies, so I thought I should find some excitement for myself, and that's how I ended up committing the crime of robbing cars."

　　不可淡忘的“剪枝”
    ——一起中学生结伙抢劫案引起的思考
    １９８８年９月２０日下午，湖南省新宁县一渡水中学学生蒋某与五中学生王某碰到一起，商议晚自习后到公路上劫车。晚九时许，蒋、王分别将平时在一起玩得较好的五中学生范某、一渡水中学学生范某、何某、李某叫出学校。蒋讲明意图，作了分工。约十分钟后，从新宁方向开来一辆货车，几名学生手持剪刀、石头、甘蔗蔸和皮鞭胁迫司机、货主交出钱财。尔后，他们又以同样方式连续抢劫４辆汽车。他们先后５次共抢得现金５６．０６元，汽车反视镜一个，高、中档香烟４包，蛋糕两包，汽车篷布一块，砸烂汽车小灯一个。现金和财物折价共计３００余元。作案者年龄最大的１９岁，最小的１５岁。平均年龄１７．３岁。
    １９８８年１０月２６日，湖南省新宁县公安局依法将他们逮捕归案。消息传开，家长震惊、学校震惊、社会震惊！人们纷纷询问：他们是怎样走上犯罪道路的？为此，我们走访了两校师生。
    调查结果表明，除了罪犯本身贪图享乐、寻求刺激外，也提出了一些应该引起我们认真思考的问题。
    思考之一：学校教育如何解决德智关系问题？目前的情况是：一些学校片面追求升学率，忽视了对人的教育。升学率的高低、学习成绩的好坏，成了考察教师和学生的唯一标准。学生普遍反映，法律常识课有课本无课时，不考试，徒有虚名。
    思考之二：如何发挥家庭教育的职能？从本案反映出来的问题看，这方面存在的问题是很严重的。罪犯张某，是全家的掌上明珠，其祖父尤为溺爱，事事顺从。孙子要玩牌，祖父便带其混迹于牌场之中。张在玩牌中结识蒋后，被蒋纠合参与抢劫犯罪。
    思考之三：学校的治安由谁管？中、小学没有专职保卫干部，公安部门也未将其纳入治安管理的视线之内。据五中师生反映，本学年来，校内屡次发生盗案，被盗现金和财物折价共计２０００多元。罪犯王某就是因盗窃钢材３５０公斤未被发现，更加胆大妄为，发展到聚众拦车抢劫的。
    思考之四：如何引导学生正确对待惊险、武打的影视、书刊？与前述普遍存在的法律知识贫乏相反，中学生对武侠传奇影视、书刊表现出特别浓厚的兴趣。９６份问卷调查统计结果，最喜欢看武侠小说和惊险武打片的有５３人，犯罪学生范某入监后忏悔说：“我走上犯罪道路的原因之一，是我看了许多惊险武侠小说和电影，所以，我想自己应该去寻找一点刺激，于是就干出了拦车抢劫的犯罪行为。”
