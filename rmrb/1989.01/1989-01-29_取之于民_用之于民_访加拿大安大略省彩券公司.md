In Canada, lottery tickets can be found almost everywhere, with a variety that can bewilder newcomers. Turn on the television, open a newspaper, and you can see the lottery results. Prizes range from a minimum of 10 Canadian dollars to tens of millions of Canadian dollars.

How exactly is Canada's lottery organized? How are its costs and profits calculated and distributed? With these questions in mind, the author recently visited the Ontario Lottery Corporation.

The Ontario Lottery Corporation is one of five lottery companies in Canada, established in 1975. The company is organized directly by the provincial government under a special law. Its board of directors consists of 9 members appointed by the provincial government, and the company must report its work to the legislature through the provincial Minister of Tourism and Recreation. However, to ensure profitability and maintain competitiveness, the company operates entirely in the form of a private enterprise.

The headquarters has departments responsible for marketing, sales, computer services, and information, coordinating the issuance, sales, advertising, and financial aspects of lottery tickets. The headquarters also has a sales network covering the entire province, consisting of 50 independent agents. To ensure safety and prevent fraud, these agents are strictly selected by the company's board of directors and can be replaced at any time if found unqualified. Below them are 12,000 retailers spread across various locations. Sales points are either set up in large stores and banks or operated by newsstands, gas stations, and convenience stores, allowing customers to purchase tickets at any time and place.

Ontario's lottery tickets have grown from the initial two types in 1975 to six types today, with three of them jointly operated with companies from other provinces. Each type of lottery ticket has a different winning method. Generally, there are two categories: one is the passive method, where the numbers on the lottery ticket are pre-printed, and the other is the active method, where the buyer can fill in the numbers according to their own preferences.

The drawing process is strictly controlled. The drawing machine is said to be a highly reputable device, with witnesses and supervisors present.

In 1987, the Ontario Lottery Corporation's lottery ticket sales reached a historic high of 1.337 billion Canadian dollars, with a net profit of 458.7 million Canadian dollars. These profits are all turned over to a provincial joint revenue fund, used for welfare and public utilities. Since 1975, the company has handed over a total of 2.1 billion Canadian dollars in profits.

The use of profits is also clearly regulated. The profits from the three types of lottery tickets issued only in Ontario are used to develop healthcare, sports, culture, and entertainment, while the profits from the three types of lottery tickets issued nationwide are used for research related to health and the environment, updating medical facilities, and building elderly housing.

In interactions with Canadian friends, I learned that almost everyone buys lottery tickets. Some even specifically mentioned to me that they buy lottery tickets hoping to win, but even if they don't win, they don't feel regretful because the profits from the lottery company are used for social welfare and public utilities. Those in genuine difficulty can apply for assistance from this fund. This may be an important reason why Canada's lottery industry is thriving.

　　取之于民　用之于民
    ——访加拿大安大略省彩券公司
    郭文福
    在加拿大，几乎到处都能发现出售彩券的地方，花样之多，令初来者眼花缭乱。打开电视，翻开报纸，你就可以看到抽彩的结果，彩奖少则１０加元，多则上千万加元。
    加拿大的彩券活动到底是如何组织的呢？它的成本和利润又是怎么计算和分配的呢？带着这些问题，笔者不久前走访了加拿大安大略省彩券公司。
    安大略省彩券公司是加拿大五家彩券公司之一，成立于１９７５年。该公司依照专门法律由省政府直接组织。其理事会的９名理事由省政府任命，公司须通过省政府的旅游和娱乐部长向议会报告工作。但为了盈利和保持竞争力，公司仍完全以私人公司的形式经营。
    公司总部设有负责市场、销售、计算机服务和信息等部门，统一筹划彩券的发行、销售、广告和财务等。总部还有一个由５０名独立经纪人组成的覆盖全省的销售网。为了保证安全和防止舞弊，这些经纪人都要经公司理事会严格挑选，发现有不合格的人就随时撤换。往下一层就是遍布各地的１．２万名零售商。售点或设于大商店、大银行中，或由报亭、加油站和杂货店兼营，以便顾客随时随地可以买到。
    安省的彩券已由１９７５年初建时的两种发展到今天的６种，其中有３种是同别省的公司联合经营的。每种彩券的中标法都不同。基本上分为两类：一类是被动法，即彩票上的号码是事先印好的，另一类是主动法，即购券人可以根据自己的意愿填写入赌的数字。
    抽奖过程控制得极为严格，抽奖机据说是一种很有信誉的机器，还有见证人和监视人在场。
    １９８７年安省彩券公司的彩券销售量创历史最高纪录，达１３．３７亿加元，其中纯利润达４．５８７亿加元。这些利润都上交省政府的一项联合岁入基金，用于福利和公用事业。自１９７５年以来，该公司已经上交了总额为２１亿加元的利润。
    利润的使用也规定得很明确，３种只在安省发行的彩券的利润用于发展保健、体育、文化和娱乐事业，另３种在全国发行的彩券的利润则用于与卫生和环境有关的研究、医疗设施的更新和修建老年人住房等。
    在同加拿大朋友的交往中我了解到他们几乎都购买彩券。一些人还特别向我谈到，他们买彩券当然想要中奖，但即便不中奖也不感到可惜，因为彩券公司赚的利润都用于社会福利和公用事业，确有生活困难的人经申请后还可以从这笔钱中得到补助。这也许是加拿大彩券业日益发达的一个重要原因。
