"Those who work but don't put in effort, even if they attend every day, won't get a salary adjustment." This is the principle that workers at the Shenyang Gear Factory have come to understand after the implementation of a work-hour assessment system.

This factory turned its losses from the previous year into a profit of 2.5 million yuan last year. One of the key reasons for this turnaround is the reform of its distribution system. In July 1987, the factory redefined work-hour quotas, assigning tasks based on eight hours per day per person. It was stipulated that while ensuring product quality, the extra production by workers would be accumulated and converted into completed work-hours. Salary adjustments and promotions would then be based primarily on the actual work-hours completed by each worker. By adopting this method, the factory, without increasing its workforce and with only minor adjustments to its equipment, produced an average of over 4,000 units of its main products, the 212 car transmission and transfer cases, per month in 1988. This was double the monthly production of over 2,000 units at the beginning of 1987. If converted into work-hours, the total work-hours completed in 1988 averaged 120,000 per month, which was also double that of 1987.

### 专治出工不出力　调资长级有依据　沈阳齿轮厂实行工时考核制

　　专治出工不出力　调资长级有依据
  　沈阳齿轮厂实行工时考核制
    据新华社沈阳电  （通讯员孟唤）“出工不出力，即便月月出满勤，调资长级也没份儿”。这是沈阳齿轮厂实行按工时进行考核的办法后，工人们认准的理儿。
    这个厂从前年初亏损变为去年创利２５０万元，其中一个重要原因是改革了分配制度。１９８７年７月份这个厂重新核定工时产额，每天按八个工时下达任务到人头，并规定在保证产品质量的同时，将工人超额生产部分累计起来，折成完成工时，调资长级时按工人实现工时多少来做为评议的主要依据。由于采取了这种办法，这个厂在人员没有增加、设备仅进行小调整的情况下，１９８８年主导产品２１２汽车变速箱和分动箱平均每月完成４０００多台，比１９８７年初每月２０００多台提高了一倍。如果折合工时计算，１９８８年平均每月完成工时总数１２万个，比１９８７年提高一倍。
