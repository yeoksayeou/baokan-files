A tax resistance incident occurred recently in Qizhuang Township, Dongcheng District, Dingzhou City, Hebei Province. The township party secretary, Chen Zhi'an, not only used various excuses to prevent the inspection team from checking the accounts but also declared, "I won't be removed from my position as secretary, and you won't be able to collect the money," refusing to make up for the evaded taxes.

The Qizhuang Township government and the Jizhong Electrical Supply Station had previously evaded, intercepted, and misappropriated national taxes, totaling 790,000 yuan in evaded business tax; 400,000 yuan in individual merchant taxes that were not withheld and remitted; and nearly 400,000 yuan in taxes that were intercepted and misappropriated for purchasing cars, issuing bonuses, and lending money at high interest rates, among other things. On October 31, 1988, the district party committee deputy secretary and district head, along with three tax officials, went to the Jizhong Electrical Supply Station in Qizhuang Township to conduct a tax inspection. They were cursed out by Chen Zhi'an. Meanwhile, some township leaders spread rumors, saying things like, "The tax bureau's authority over personnel, finances, and materials has been delegated to the township, so the tax bureau's work must listen to the township," continuing to create difficulties and obstacles for the tax inspection work.

　　定州发生一起抗税事件
    有关领导知法违法令人愤慨
    本报讯  河北省定州市东城区齐堡乡前不久发生一起公然抗拒税收检查事件。该乡党委书记陈志安不但以种种借口不让检查组查账，而且声称，“撤不了我书记的职，拿不了钱”，拒不补缴偷漏税款。
    齐堡乡政府和乡冀中机电供应站曾偷漏、截留、挪用国家税款，先后共偷漏营业税七点九万元；擅自不代扣代缴个体商贩税金四万元；并把近四万元税款截留挪用于购买小汽车，发放奖金，放高利贷等。一九八八年十月三十一日，定州市东城区区长、区委副书记按照省、地、市的统一部署，带领税务所长等三名税务干部，到齐堡乡冀中机电供应站进行税收检查，被陈志安骂出门外。同时，某些乡领导还四处放风，说什么“税务所人、财、物三权已下放到乡里了，税务所的工作就得听乡里的”，继续给税收检查工作制造困难，设置障碍。
