In October 1985, I bought a Shanghai-made Jinxing brand color television at the Beijing Asia-Pacific Expo. Unfortunately, in July 1986, this color TV was damaged by lightning. Full of hope, I went to the designated repair point for Jinxing color TVs, the Beijing Huabo Radio Repair Shop. The technician who received me said that the repair would be at my own expense. I agreed. After 10 days, I went to the Huabo Radio Repair Shop as scheduled, but the technician who had received me earlier said that the spare parts were not available, and I should come back in a month. Over the past two years, I have visited the repair shop more than 10 times, each time leaving disappointed.

Later, I learned that a national household appliance electronic product maintenance service center had been established. Through relevant personnel, I found the North China Household Appliance Electronic Product Maintenance Service Center. In less than a month, my color TV was repaired.

　　彩电修理的难与易
    我于１９８５年１０月在北京亚太地区博览会上买了一台上海产的金星牌彩色电视机。没想到，１９８６年７月，这台彩电被雷电击坏。我满怀希望找到金星彩电厂的特约保修点——北京华波无线电修理部，接待的师傅说，需自费修理。我答应了。过了１０天，我按约定的时间来到华波无线电修理部，那位曾接待过我的师傅说，备件暂时解决不了，一个月后再来吧。近两年来，我跑了１０多趟修理部，每次都是扫兴而归。
    后来，我得知，有关部门成立了全国家用电子产品维修服务中心。经有关人员介绍，我找到了华北地区家用电子产品维修服务中心。不到一个月，我的彩电就修好了。
