Hungarian Parliament today passed the Assembly Law and Association Law drafts, which will have a significant impact on the country's political life.

The Hungarian Interior Minister, Kurczal Karman, explained the two legal drafts at the parliamentary session that began yesterday. He emphasized that these are the first legislative steps taken in the process of Hungary's political system reform and the establishment of a rule-of-law state. He said that the right to assemble and associate are among the most basic human freedoms, and the realization of these rights is an important measure of social democratization.

When discussing the issue of association, he said that according to the Association Law, everyone has the right to establish organizations with others, but there are two restrictions: first, armed organizations cannot be established; second, the primary purpose of the established organization should not be for business activities. He said that the most debated issue regarding the Association Law is whether political parties can be established based on it. He believes that political parties can be established according to the Association Law, but considering the importance of political parties, a separate party establishment law is still needed.

He said that people have the right to hold peaceful assemblies, marches, and demonstrations to express their individual and collective opinions. However, he stressed that, like workers' strikes, this is a means used only when there are no other options. He pointed out that when exercising this right, one should act according to the rules, refrain from criminal activities, refrain from provocative activities, and not infringe upon the rights and freedoms of others.

The meeting required the government to submit the draft of the party establishment law to the parliament no later than August 1.

　　匈国会通过集会法和结社法草案
    新华社布达佩斯１月１１日电  匈牙利国会今天通过了将对国家政治生活产生重大影响的集会法和结社法草案。
    在昨天开始的国会会议上，匈内务部长库尔恰尔·卡尔曼就两个法律草案作了说明。他强调，这是匈政治体制改革和建立法制国家过程中所采取的第一个立法步骤。他说，集会、结社是人的自由权利之中的最基本的权利，实现这个权利是衡量社会民主化的重要尺度。
    他在谈到结社问题时说，根据结社法，每人都有同其他人建立组织的权利，但有两个限制：一是不得建立武装组织；二是所建立的组织的首要目的不是从事经营活动。他说，对结社法争论最多的是能否依据结社法建立政党的问题。他认为，根据结社法可以建立政党，但鉴于政党的重要性，因此还需要专门制定建党法。
    他说，人们有权举行和平集会、游行和示威，以表达自己的和集体的意见。但他强调，如同工人罢工一样，这是一种没有其它办法时方使用的手段。他指出，在使用这一权利时，应按章程办事，不得搞犯罪活动，不得搞挑衅活动，不得损害他人的权利和自由。
    会议要求政府最迟于８月１日前向国会提出建党法草案。
