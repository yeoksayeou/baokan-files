Title: Beyond Expectations

On January 17, a dramatic scene unfolded on a live national television broadcast in Israel: a group of young Israeli soldiers in the military camp of Nablus, the largest city on the West Bank, angrily questioned Israeli Prime Minister Shamir. They asked why the restrictions on Israeli soldiers firing at protesters had been lifted and why they were forced to beat innocent civilians. They felt ashamed of their actions and felt "ashamed before their hometown elders."

Prime Minister Shamir probably did not expect to encounter such an embarrassing situation during his camp inspection. Because, since the Palestinian masses began protesting against Israel more than a year ago, Israeli soldiers have been the "stars" of international news broadcasts around the world. Those soldiers, fully armed, strutting in front of protesters who could only throw stones, gave the impression of being cold and cruel. Some of them have already realized that they are playing the role of executioners and even shouted to Shamir that the "only way out of the Israeli-Palestinian conflict is a political solution." This was something Shamir did not expect.

It is clear that the Israeli authorities' stubborn insistence on an aggressive expansionist policy is so unpopular. It not only increasingly isolates Israel internationally but also faces growing opposition from its own people. The "rebellion" of Israeli soldiers is a new serious warning to the Shamir administration.

　　始料不及
    一嵩
    本月１７日，在以色列全国实况转播的电视节目中出现了一个戏剧性场面：约旦河西岸最大城市纳布卢斯军营的一群年轻的以色列士兵在愤怒诘问以色列总理沙米尔，为什么取消了以色列士兵向示威者射击的限制，为什么强迫他们殴打无辜百姓。他们为自己的所作所为感到羞耻，觉得“愧对家乡父老”。
    沙米尔总理大概没有料到在军营巡视中会遇到如此尴尬的场面。因为，自一年多前巴勒斯坦群众反以示威至今，以色列士兵堪称为各国电视国际新闻节目中的“大明星”。那些浑身披挂的军人面对只能扔石块的示威者耀武扬威，给人的印象是冷酷和残忍。他们中的一部分已经认识到自己扮演的是刽子手的角色，甚至向沙米尔喊出了巴以冲突的“唯一出路是政治解决”的口号。这是沙米尔所始料不及的。
    可见，以色列当局顽固坚持侵略扩张政策是多么不得人心，它不仅在国际上越来越陷于孤立，也日益遭到本国群众的反对，以色列士兵的“造反”，是对沙米尔当局新的严重的警告。
