Near the radar station, soldiers holding red flowers stood in two rows, like two red rivers, quietly lying on the green grassland.

With a stern command, the flowers began to sway, and the calm red river immediately surged with red waves.

It was the wife of Commander Wu, holding her one-year-old son, Cong'er, who had come from the southern water town.

She looked like an angel, walking forward and nodding frequently to the soldiers.

Cong'er, seeing this novel scene, innocently laughed, laughing as beautifully as the flowers.

The welcoming ceremony was organized by the platoon leader, Zhao. He and his soldiers stood like iron towers, their right hands saluting without a single tremor. They all felt that only in this way could they express their respect and condolences to her, and only in this way could they express their deep love for Cong'er, the son of a soldier.

On the day Cong'er was born into this world, Commander Wu unfortunately sacrificed himself while carrying out an important mission. The death of a national leader requires a state funeral, and the death of a company commander requires a "company funeral." His body was buried next to the radar station, with the tombstone facing the majestic radar antenna. After she gave birth and recovered, she wanted to come to the company immediately to let Cong'er see where his father was buried. But everyone said Cong'er was too young, the journey was too far, and it was inconvenient, so she had to wait until today.

Cong'er quickly became the spiritual wealth of the entire company, becoming the company's treasure. Two weeks passed, and he had not slept a single night with his mother. The soldiers all wanted to hold him and sleep with him in their beds. They all wanted to represent the commander and give Cong'er some paternal warmth.

The company's water supply was transported by truck from 130 kilometers away. In winter, the water would freeze, and it had to be melted in pots. Water was more precious than oil, but the soldiers still insisted on giving Cong'er a bath every day.

Cong'er loved flowers. Wherever he slept, there would be a bouquet of flowers on the bed. Where there were flowers, it was known that Cong'er was sleeping there.

In summer, the grassland was covered with flowers. Zhao, the platoon leader, secretly took Cong'er to a distant part of the station. Seeing that no one was around, he quietly told Cong'er, "Call me dad, and I'll pick you some flowers." Suddenly, a group of soldiers emerged from the flowers, each holding flowers, running towards Cong'er, using the flowers to make him laugh and be happy.

The soldiers' enthusiasm brought joy to Cong'er, and Cong'er's joy gradually erased the sadness that the company had once experienced. Cong'er did not leave for a long time; he could not bear to leave the soldiers. Cong'er's mother also did not leave; she could not bear to leave Cong'er, nor could she bear to leave the soldiers who loved Cong'er.

Snow fell on the grassland, and the flowers disappeared. Cong'er began to cry and fuss.

"I have a way," the soldiers used a small knife to carve flowers out of red carrots and present them to Cong'er.

"I also have a trick," Zhao, the platoon leader, picked up cabbage roots, carved them into flowers, dyed them with red ink, and placed them in front of Cong'er.

In winter, Cong'er's bed was never without flowers.

Unexpectedly, Cong'er suddenly fell seriously ill, and heavy snow completely blocked the roads of the entire grassland.

The telegraph keys clicked rapidly, and the soldiers urgently sent a message to the distant commander: "Quickly send a plane!"

The radar antenna began to rotate, and the eyes of the entire company were on the screen, searching for the echo they all hoped for.

"Can the plane come?" she was anxious but had not shed a tear.

"Don't worry, the commander will understand that Cong'er is no longer an ordinary life."

Night fell, and the helicopter came. To provide a clear signal for the plane, the soldiers each held a torch, like the time they lined up at the station, the dancing flames like a red river, surging with red waves. Ah, those are the company's flowers, the military's flowers, blooming for the company's son, blooming for the soldier's son, blooming year after year, month after month, never fading!

### 红花·连花·军花

　　红花·连花·军花
    李琦 
    雷达阵地旁，左手攥着红花的战士，排成两列，像两条红色的河，静静地躺在绿色的草原上。
    随着一声严肃的口令，花儿晃动起来，平静的红河，即刻翻起了奔腾的红浪。
    是吴连长的妻子，怀抱着刚满周岁的儿子聪儿，从南国水乡来了。
    她长得像天使，向前走着，对战士频频点头。
    聪儿看着这新奇的场面，天真地笑了起来，笑得和花儿一样可爱。
    欢迎仪式是排头的那位赵排长组织的。他和他的战士，像铁塔一样挺立着，敬礼的右手纹丝不动。他们都觉得只有这样，才能表达对她的敬意与安慰，都觉得只有这样，才能表达对聪儿这位军人之子的深深的爱。
    在聪儿来到这个世界报到的第二天，吴连长因执行一次重大任务不幸牺牲了。国家元首逝世，要举行国葬，一连之长牺牲，连队给他举行了“连葬”，遗体就埋在雷达阵地旁，墓碑向着威严的雷达天线。她生产满月后，想马上来连队，叫聪儿看看他爸爸埋在什么地方。可人们都说聪儿太小，路远，不便，她只好熬到今天。
    聪儿很快成了全连战士的精神财富，成了连队的宝贝，两个星期过去了，他没和妈妈睡过一夜觉。战士们都想抱着他到自己床上，搂着他睡觉。他们都想代表连长给聪儿一些父亲般的温暖。
    连队用水，是用汽车到１３０公里外拉来的，冬天，拉来的水结成冰，还得放到锅里化，滴水贵过油，可战士还是要每天给聪儿洗一个澡。
    聪儿爱花，他到哪张床上，哪张床头就有一束花；哪个床头有了花，也就知道聪儿睡在哪张床上。
    夏天，草原遍地是花，赵排长偷偷地把聪儿抱到阵地远处，看看四周没有人，就悄悄地对聪儿说：“叫爸爸，我给你摘花。”忽然，从花丛中钻出一群战士，他们手里都举着花，向聪儿跑来，用花逗他笑，逗他乐。
    战士的热情，给了聪儿快乐，聪儿的快乐，渐渐地抹去了连队曾经有过的悲哀。聪儿久久没走，他离不开战士。聪儿的妈妈也没走，她离不开聪儿，也离不开疼聪儿的战士。
    草原落雪了，花儿无影无踪了。聪儿开始哭闹。
    “我有办法。”战士用小刀，把红萝卜刻成了花，献给聪儿。
    “我也有招儿。”赵排长把白菜根拣来，雕成花，染上红墨水，放到聪儿面前。
    冬天，聪儿的床头没有断过花。
    哪知聪儿突然得了重病，偏偏大雪又严严实实封住了整个草原的路。
    电键紧促地跳动起来，战士通过迅速的电波向远方首长恳求：快派飞机来！
    雷达天线转动起来，全连的目光，都在荧光屏上寻找着共同期待的回波。
    “飞机能来吗？”她心急，却一直没掉泪。
    “放心，首长会懂得聪儿已经不是普通的生命。”
    夜幕降临，直升机来了，为了给飞机提供明显的信号，战士们每人手拿一个火把，像当初，列队在阵地旁，一团团跳跃着的火花儿，像火红的河，翻腾着火红的浪。呵，那是连花，那是军花，为连队之子开，为军人之子开，年年月月开不败！
