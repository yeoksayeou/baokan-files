Title: Misconceptions in the Development of Productive Forces

There are several misconceptions in the development of productive forces that need to be addressed:

1.	Focusing solely on output and profits while neglecting the development of various elements of productive forces. Many comrades believe that as long as output increases year by year, they can report to leaders and the masses. Other work can be taken lightly or ignored, leading to the erroneous tendency of pursuing output and profits at the expense of other important tasks. This needs to be corrected.

2.	Overemphasizing the material aspects of productive forces while ignoring the human factor. Many enterprises focus only on the use of labor without considering the training of the workforce. The attitude of "wanting the horse to run but not wanting to feed it" will hinder the improvement of labor quality and ultimately impede the development of productive forces.

3.	Focusing solely on the "hard" aspects of productive forces while ignoring the "soft" aspects. In a developing commodity economy, "soft" factors are becoming increasingly important as intangible assets and wealth. Currently, there is a lack of attention to the "soft" aspects of production, such as backward management, poor information flow, and low credibility, which are hindering economic development.

4.	Focusing solely on the development of micro-level productive forces while neglecting macro-level productive forces. The standard should be whether it is beneficial to the overall development of productive forces.

5.	Focusing on short-term gains in productive forces while lacking long-term planning. Some cadres only pay attention to the growth of production during their tenure without considering long-term plans. They prioritize immediate benefits over expanding reproduction. These short-term behaviors are contrary to the objective requirements of productive force development and need to be guided correctly.

### 发展生产力中几种片面认识

　　发展生产力中几种片面认识
    一、只重视产值、利润，忽视生产力各要素自身的发展。不少同志认为，只要产值上去，阿拉伯数字年年增加，在领导和群众面前就可交帐了，其他工作可抓可放，无关紧要，因而，出现了片面追求产值利润而置其他工作于不顾的错误倾向，这是需要认真纠正的。
    二、只重视生产力中物的因素，忽视生产力中人的因素，不少企业只管劳动力的使用，而不管劳动力的培训，“既要马儿跑，又要马儿不吃草”。这样下去，劳动力素质得不到提高，生产力发展终将受到阻碍。
    三、只重视生产力中“硬”的因素，忽视生产力中“软”的因素。在商品经济日益发展的情况下，“软”因素显得越来越重要，成了“无形”的资产和财富。现在，对生产中“软”的因素，没有引起高度重视，管理落后，信息不灵，信誉不高等问题普遍存在，成了阻碍经济发展的因素。
    四、只重视微观生产力发展，而忽视宏观生产力的发展。要以是否有利于全局生产力发展为标准。
    五、只顾眼前生产力发展，而缺乏长期发展生产力的打算。有些干部只注意任职期间生产的增长，而没有一个长期的打算，只顾眼前利益，而不愿扩大再生产。这些“短期行为”，与生产力发展的客观要求相悖，需要正确引导。
