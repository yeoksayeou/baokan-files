Just after the New Year, the energetic Dalian Zhonghua Commercial Row Wushu Sanshou team, led by Coach Qiu Guoyou, departed from Dalian Bay for Tianjin to participate in the Sanshou Elite Competition. Among the 15 elite teams, theirs was the youngest, having been established only in May of the previous year, less than a year old! Such a young team naturally lacked experience, so many underestimated them. However, as soon as the competition began, they won battle after battle, defeating multiple elite teams, and ultimately securing a championship in one category, a fourth-place finish in the team event, and the Courage Award. When Coach Qiu Guoyou raised the trophy to acknowledge the enthusiastic Tianjin audience, a round of applause erupted around him.

This team dares to fight, and their leader, Coach Qiu Guoyou, dares even more. In several national arena competitions, he used his iron legs to defeat numerous masters. Sometimes he would fly over the head with a kick, sometimes he would sweep with a whirlwind kick, striking high or low as needed, leaving his opponents with no chance to counterattack. Since then, he has been known as "Qiu with the Iron Leg." Moreover, his arena awareness is very strong, often driving the opponent to the dangerous edge of the arena, then kicking out, with lightning speed, sending them off the stage, deciding the victory with one kick.

After becoming the coach in Dalian, many young people heard his name and eagerly signed up for training, hoping to receive his guidance. Normally, as a coach, one would just need to demonstrate the movements. However, Qiu Guoyou still insists on practicing every day and sparring with the team members, one after another, consuming a great deal of energy. Some athletes said, "Coach Qiu, just tell us, and we'll understand. You don't need to demonstrate." He replied, "If I don't practice, how will I know your strengths and weaknesses? That way, I can't train good fighters." To help the team members improve their offensive techniques, he even took on the role of the defender, allowing them to kick and strike him. He deeply understands that to forge iron, one must be hard first.

While training the team members to have strong fists and legs, Qiu Guoyou also continuously improves their flexibility and adaptability, enabling them to observe six directions and listen in eight directions, achieving seamless offense and defense, and not being deceived by fake moves. He requires the team members not only to be able to strike the upper, middle, and lower parts of the body but also to fight intelligently and flexibly in the arena. Even if their physical strength and technique are not as good as others, they should use their wisdom to win. In this competition, the team's good results were to some extent achieved through clever tactics. People summarize Qiu Guoyou's training method as "skill refined through practice, technique above spirit. Fusing wisdom and technique into one, embedding high-level moves into offensive and defensive techniques." Qiu Guoyou said, "You flatter me. I am just experimenting with how to combine individual training with systematic training. This is also a result of being pushed to the limit. Because my team members come from various backgrounds, both military and civilian, their levels are uneven, and if I don't tailor my teaching to each individual, we won't make any progress."

Qiu Guoyou has now found his way in Wushu Sanshou training, and he will continue to explore and innovate new training methods, striving to cultivate more masters.

　　“技精于炼　术高于灵”
    ——记武术散打教练邱国友
    新年刚过，虎虎生风的大连中花商行武术散打队，在崂山道长高徒邱国友主教练的率领下从大连湾开赴天津参加散打精英赛。１５支精英队中，数它最年轻，从去年５月建队至今还不到一岁呢！这样年轻的队自然缺乏经验，所以被多数人小看。但是一开场，他们就连打胜仗，击败多路精英，最后夺得一个级别冠军、团体第四和敢斗奖。当邱国友主教练高举奖杯向热情的天津观众致意时，四周爆出一片掌声。
    这支队伍敢拚，率领它的主教练邱国友更敢斗。几次全国擂台赛，他用铁脚踢倒数名高手。时而飞脚过头，时而旋风扫腿，高来高打，低来抵击，打得对手无反击之力。自此便有“邱铁脚”之美称。不仅如此，他的擂台意识也很强，常把对方逼到擂台危险边沿，然后起脚，以迅雷不及掩耳之势，将其踢下台，一脚定胜局。
    邱国友到大连当主教练后，年轻人听到他的名字纷纷报名，要求指教，照理当了主教练，讲讲动作就成了。可是，他仍每天坚持练拳并和队员一起对练，打了一个又一个，体力消耗很大。有的选手说：邱教练，您说说我们就明白了，自己不要打了。他回答说：“我不打怎么知道你们的特点和长处，那样就练不出好手来。”为了让队员练进攻技术，他甚至甘当防守，让其踢打。他深知打铁必须身先硬。
    邱国友在训练队员拳脚过硬的同时，还不断提高灵活应变能力，使其能眼观六路、耳听八方，达到攻防自如，不被假动作所迷惑。他要求队员不光能打上盘、中盘、下盘，赛场上要打得聪明灵活，即使体力、技术不如人家，也要用智慧取胜。这次大赛，全队能取得良好成绩在某种程度上就是凭着好脑子。人们把邱国友的训练法概括成“技精于炼、术高于灵。熔智慧技术于一炉，将高招镶进攻防技击中。”邱国友说：“过奖了，我不过是试验一下如何把单个训练和系统训练结合起来，这也是逼出来的。因为我的队员来自各行各业，有军有民，水平参差不齐，不因人施教就寸步难行。”
    邱国友在武术散打训练上现在已摸出了门道，新的训练道路还要去继续探讨，开拓，他争取培养更多的高手。 　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　本报记者　黄振中
