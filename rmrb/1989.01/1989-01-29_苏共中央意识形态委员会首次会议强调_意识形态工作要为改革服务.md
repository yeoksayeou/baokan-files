The first meeting of the CPSU Central Committee's Ideological Commission recently emphasized that the ideological work in the Soviet Union should be changed to serve economic and political reforms.

Tass reported today that the meeting was chaired by CPSU Central Committee Politburo member and Secretary Medvedev.

The meeting noted that the current high level of public political enthusiasm provides new opportunities for ideological work, but also exposes many sharp problems, contradictions, and disagreements. Current ideological work should fully consider public opinion and the interests of various strata of workers, promote the smooth implementation of reforms, and be good at communicating with the masses and doing persuasive work.

The meeting emphasized that the focus of ideological work this year is: the election of people's representatives and the People's Congress, the CPSU Central Committee plenary session on agricultural policy issues, the CPSU Central Committee plenary session on national relations issues, participation in the current discussion on the concept of socialism, and the analysis of urgent issues in ideological work and the formulation of corresponding suggestions.

The meeting also discussed the draft of the press law, proposing suggestions on clarifying the relationship between the media, citizens, state organs, and social organizations, as well as the role of newspaper editorial boards and the rights of journalists.

The CPSU Central Committee's Ideological Commission was established at the CPSU Central Committee plenary session held on September 30 last year, with Medvedev as the chairman.

　　苏共中央意识形态委员会首次会议强调    
    意识形态工作要为改革服务
    新华社莫斯科１月２７日电  苏共中央意识形态委员会最近召开第一次会议，要求改变苏联的意识形态工作，以便为经济改革和政治改革服务。
    塔斯社今天报道说，苏共中央政治局委员、中央书记梅德韦杰夫主持了这次会议。
    会议认为，当前群众政治热情高涨为开展意识形态工作提供了新的机会，但也暴露出不少尖锐问题、矛盾和分歧。目前的意识形态工作要充分考虑公众意见和各阶层劳动人民利益，促进改革顺利推行，要善于同群众对话，做说服工作。
    会议强调，今年意识形态工作的重点是：人民代表选举和人民代表大会、有关农业政策问题的苏共中央全会、有关民族关系问题的苏共中央全会、参与当前关于社会主义概念的探讨、分析思想工作的紧迫问题并制订相应的建议。
    会议还讨论了新闻法草案，提出了有关明确舆论工具同公民、国家机关和社会团体的关系以及报刊编委会的作用和记者权利等建议。
    苏共中央意识形态委员会是在去年９月３０日举行的苏共中央全会上成立的，主席是梅德韦杰夫。
