Citizens of appropriate age must fulfill their legal obligations and plant 3 to 5 trees annually. The head of the Forestry Department demands that all regions carry out tree-planting activities thoroughly.

The People's Daily, Beijing, January 12th - Xinhua News Agency reporter Zhang Jianjun and People's Daily reporter Gao Baosheng report: As the new year begins, the annual nationwide voluntary tree-planting campaign is gradually unfolding from south to north. Today, Vice Chairman of the National Afforestation Committee and Minister of the Forestry Department, Gao Dezhan, pointed out here that it is a legal, mandatory public service for citizens of appropriate age to plant 3 to 5 trees annually. This is a hard task that must be seriously completed.

This year marks the 10th anniversary of Arbor Day and the 8th year of the nationwide voluntary tree-planting campaign. Over the past few years, although significant achievements have been made in nationwide voluntary tree-planting and land greening, the implementation of this campaign has been uneven. The number of participants and the number of trees planted are far from meeting the requirements. According to the 1982 national census data, the total population of the country was 1.00391 billion, of which 686.72 million were citizens of appropriate age. According to the requirement of planting 3 to 5 trees per person annually, 20 to 30 billion trees should be planted each year. However, currently, only about 200 million people participate in tree-planting annually, and only about 1 billion trees are planted, which is roughly one-third of the required number. Especially in rural areas, a significant portion of citizens of appropriate age have not fulfilled this obligation.

At today's meeting of the heads of national afforestation offices, Gao Dezhan analyzed the various reasons for the above situation and said that many people, including some leading cadres, are still unaware of the decision by the National People's Congress on launching the nationwide voluntary tree-planting campaign. Some people have a weak sense of the rule of law and a shallow awareness of greening, treating the mandatory tree-planting task as optional or even as an arbitrary assignment. Some places and units only pay attention to tree-planting during the planting season, resulting in formalism and little effect. There are also some regions where the institutions responsible for greening are merely in name, with no one in charge of specific work.

Gao Dezhan also pointed out that some places have the phenomenon of planting trees every year but not seeing the forest. The inspection and acceptance are not strict, the quality of afforestation is not high, only planting without management, and the reported figures are not genuine, which has dampened the enthusiasm of the masses.

To carry out the voluntary tree-planting campaign thoroughly, Gao Dezhan requires that all regions allocate tasks according to the number of citizens of appropriate age, conduct inspections and acceptances according to the tasks, and handle units and individuals who fail to fulfill their obligations without reason according to regulations. The voluntary tree-planting tasks should be allocated and implemented layer by layer, like family planning indicators. Serious plans should be made, and the responsibility system for greening targets during the term of office should be implemented. Propaganda and education, as well as organizational mobilization, should be done well.

　　适龄公民要履行法定义务
    每人每年须植树三至五株
    林业部负责人要求各地扎实开展植树活动
    本报北京１月１２日讯  新华社记者张建军、本报记者高保生报道：新年伊始，全国一年一度的义务植树活动从南至北逐步展开。全国绿化委员会副主任、林业部部长高德占今天在这里指出，适龄公民每人每年植树３—５株，是一项法定的、义务性的公益劳动，是一项硬任务，必须认真完成。
    今年是植树节１０周年、开展全民义务植树活动的第８个年头。过去几年中，全民义务植树和国土绿化虽然取得很大成绩，但这项活动开展很不平衡，参加的人数和完成株数远未达到要求。根据１９８２年全国人口普查资料，全国总人口为１０．０３９１亿人，其中适龄公民６．８６７２亿人，按每人每年栽树３至５株的要求，每年应植２０至３０亿株。但是，现在每年只有２亿人左右参加植树，植树只有１０亿株左右，大体相当法定数的１／３。特别是在广大农村，相当一部分适龄公民没有履行这项义务。
    在今天召开的全国绿化办公室主任会议上，高德占在分析造成上述状况的种种原因时说，现在有不少人包括一些领导干部还不知道全国人大关于开展全民义务植树运动的决议，一些人法制观念不强、绿化意识淡薄，把法定的义务植树任务看成可有可无，甚至当成乱摊派。一些地方和单位每到植树季节，才临时抓一阵子，流于形式，成效不大。也有一些地区抓绿化的机构徒有虚名，没人抓具体工作。
    高德占还针对一些地方存在的年年造林，年年不见林的现象指出，检查验收不严，造林质量不高，只造不管，上报数字不实，挫伤了群众的积极性。
    为深入扎实地开展义务植树活动，高德占要求各地按适龄人数落实任务，按任务进行检查验收，对无故不履行义务的单位和个人要按规定进行处理。要把义务植树任务像计划生育指标一样，层层分解，层层落实。要认真制定规划，实行领导任期绿化目标责任制，搞好宣传教育和组织动员工作。
