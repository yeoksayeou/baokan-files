The cleanup of fixed asset investment projects has been fully launched nationwide. In the initial phase, the focus was mainly on state-owned projects such as buildings, basic construction, and renovation projects. Rural collective, especially township and village collective investment projects, have not been significantly addressed yet.

This nationwide cleanup of investment projects covers all types, whether state-owned, collective, or individual; whether basic construction or technological renovation; whether productive or non-productive; whether large, medium, or small-scale; whether within the plan or outside the plan; whether in coastal economic development zones or special economic zones. Township and village collective investment projects are naturally included. It is heartening to see that many regions have begun to clean up township and village collective investment projects. This proactive cleanup and adjustment has already started to receive public praise.

In recent years, the development of urban and rural collective enterprises has been rapid, with investment growing rapidly and construction scales expanding continuously. From 1981 to 1987, state-owned fixed asset investment grew by an average of 15.3% per year, while urban and rural collective and individual investments grew by an average of 37.7% per year, a rate 22.4 percentage points higher than the former. The proportion of urban and rural collective and individual investments in the total national fixed asset investments increased from 36.8% in 1987 to 38.1% in 1988.

Statistical data also show that in urban and rural collective and individual investments, the proportion from rural areas is significant. In 1987, it was 79%, and in 1988, it was around 77%. Rural individual investments are mainly used for personal housing construction, while collective investments are not much used for agricultural production, accounting for about 11.6%, with most of the funds going into the construction of township enterprises.

The rapid rise of township enterprises has played a positive role in changing the single-industry structure of rural areas, revitalizing the rural economy, accelerating industrialization, increasing national fiscal revenue and farmers' income, and properly arranging rural surplus labor. However, it is also necessary to recognize that, similar to urban industries, township enterprises generally have more processing industries, repeated constructions, and many enterprises with poor product quality, high energy and raw material consumption, and low management levels and competitiveness. Solving these problems will help township enterprises develop in a healthier manner.

Indeed, township enterprises have been adjusting themselves according to market needs to ensure their survival. However, some enterprise managers focus only on short-term profits while neglecting national macro policies, leading to certain blind spots. This requires local authorities to guide them, combining national macro requirements with market needs, so that township enterprises can adjust their industrial and product structures based on proactive cleanup. Currently, rectifying the economic environment and economic order means that for township collective investment construction, there may be difficulties, but it is also a good opportunity. The national macro requirements are clearer and more specific, which points the way for the development of township enterprises. For agricultural production (including agriculture, forestry, water conservancy, animal husbandry, fisheries, meteorology, etc.), industries directly related to agriculture, agricultural and sideline product processing, export earnings, urban and rural transportation, education, health, science and technology, and coal mining projects, these should be protected and developed. However, a significant portion of other projects should be stopped or delayed, and proactive reductions should be made. Only by making some sacrifices can we gain something. Through active and proactive cleanup and adjustment, China's township enterprises will surely thrive in the process of rectifying the environment, regulating the order, and deepening the reform.

### 乡镇集体投资项目也要主动清理

　　乡镇集体投资项目也要主动清理
    鲁牧
    清理固定资产投资项目，已在全国各地全面展开。前一段清理，大都集中在全民所有制的楼堂馆所、基本建设和更新改造项目上，对城乡集体特别是乡镇集体投资项目迄今涉及不多。
    这次全社会性的投资项目清理，不论是全民的还是集体、个体的，是基本建设还是技术改造，是生产性的还是非生产性的，是大中型或限额以上的还是小型或限额以下的，是计划内还是计划外的，是沿海经济开发区的还是经济特区的，统统作为清理的对象。乡镇集体投资项目，自然也不例外。人们高兴地看到，许多地区对乡镇集体投资项目已开始进行清理。这种主动清理、调整，也已开始受到舆论称赞。
    近几年来，城乡集体企业建设发展很快，投资增长迅猛，基建规模不断扩大。１９８１至１９８７年期间，全民所有制固定资产投资平均每年增长１５．３％，而城乡集体、个体投资平均每年增长３７．７％，其发展速度比前者高出２２．４个百分点。城乡集体、个体投资在全社会固定资产投资中所占的比重，由１９８７年的３６．８％上升为１９８８年的３８．１％，又有增加。
    统计资料还显示，在城乡集体、个体投资中，农村占的比重不小。１９８７年为７９％，１９８８年也在７７％左右。农村个体投资主要用于个人建房，集体投资实际用于农业生产的不多，约占１１．６％，大部分用在乡镇企业的建设上。
    乡镇企业的迅速崛起，对改变农村单一产业结构，振兴农村经济，加快工业化进程，增加国家财政税收来源和农民收入，妥善安排农村剩余劳动力等，诸多方面都起了积极的作用。但也要看到，就投资项目而言，与城市工业一样，乡镇企业一般加工工业较多，重复建设不少，产品质量不高、能源和原材料消耗过大、管理水平和竞争能力差的企业较多。认真解决这些问题，将使乡镇企业建设进一步走上健康发展的轨道。
    诚然，乡镇企业在发展中，按照市场需要不断进行着自我调整，以求自身的生存。但是，也有一些企业经营者只顾眼前谋利而忽视国家宏观要术，从而发生某些盲目性。这就要求各地主管部门善于引导，将国家宏观要求和市场需要结合起来，使乡镇企业在主动清理的基础上，进行产业结构和产品结构的调整。当前，治理经济环境，整顿经济秩序，对乡镇集体投资建设来说，既可能带来困难，又是一种良好机遇。国家宏观要求比过去更加明确、具体，这就为乡镇企业的发展指明了方向。对于农业（包括农、林、水利、畜牧、水产、气象等）生产建设，与农业直接有关的支农工业，农副产品加工，出口创汇，城乡交通运输，文教、卫生、科技以及煤矿项目等，要保，要发展。而其他相当一部分项目要停建缓建，主动压缩。有所舍，才有所得。通过积极主动的清理、调整，我国乡镇企业定将在治理环境、整顿秩序、深化改革中获得兴旺发展。
