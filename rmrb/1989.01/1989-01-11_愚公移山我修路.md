At the start of the new year, Hunan Provincial Party Secretary and Governor Xiong Qingquan inscribed the name "Zhang Public Road" for the 90-year-old Zhang Chunming, who had been greening Shao Feng and voluntarily repairing roads. Provincial Party Deputy Secretary and Chairman of the Provincial Political Consultative Conference Liu Zheng wrote the inscription "Three Uncles Zhang's Road Repair Memoir."

Zhang Chunming, known as "Zhang San Gong" by the people, was born on November 7, 1899, and is now 90 years old. He originally came from Xiangxiang County. Due to his poor family background and inability to marry, he moved to the "Xian Nü An" on Shao Feng Mountain in the early 1940s, where he was hired as a monk, doing odd jobs and farming to make a living. After liberation, he continued to work on the farm, diligently producing. In 1964, Zhang San Gong, who was over sixty, went to the village-run forest farm on Shao Feng Mountain. He cooked, planted vegetables, raised seedlings, and protected the forest, doing everything. He did this for 20 years. In 1984, he voluntarily took on the task of repairing the Shao Feng Road. He brought his own tools and did not ask for payment, saying in his own words, "Doing good deeds should be known to others is not true goodness." To save time, he sometimes brought a bowl of lunch and ate on the spot. Because he worked tirelessly every day, going out early and returning late, the Shao Feng Road was smooth and unobstructed. The neighbors often advised, "Uncle Zhang, you are so old, just enjoy your five guarantees and live a peaceful life, don't bother with the road repair." Old Zhang always replied with a smile, "Like Yu Gong moving mountains, I build roads. If I don't do it at 90, when will I do it? In the past, guarding the temple and receiving 'pilgrims' was superstition; now repairing roads and receiving tourists is a good thing, and I will do it to the end."

The story of Zhang Chunming voluntarily repairing roads has become a famous tale in Shao Shan. Last year during the Double Ninth Festival, he was named an advanced elderly producer in Shao Shan District. On December 23, provincial leaders Xiong Qingquan and Liu Zheng, after participating in the 95th anniversary commemoration of Mao Zedong's birth, specially invited him from the road repair site to Di Shui Dong, where they held a banquet to comfort and wish him good health and a long life in his old age. They also agreed to inscribe and erect a monument for him "to promote virtue and inspire people."

　　“愚公移山我修路”
    陈高举
    新年伊始，湖南省委书记、省长熊清泉为９旬老人章纯明绿化韶峰、义务修路树碑立传，题写了碑名“章公路”；省委副书记、省政协主席刘正撰写了碑文《三阿公修路纪略》。
    被人尊称为“章三阿公”的章纯明老人，生于１８９９年１１月７日，现年９０岁，原籍湘乡县。因家境贫穷，无钱婚娶，于４０年代初流落到了韶峰山上的“仙女庵”，受雇为僧，以打杂、种田为业，糊口度日。解放以后一直在家务农，勤劳生产。１９６４年，年过花甲的章三公登上了韶峰山上的村办林场。煮饭、种菜、育苗、护林，样样都干，一干就是２０年。１９８４年他又自动承担了维修韶峰路的任务，他自备工具，不要报酬，用他自己的话讲叫做“为善要人知不是真善。”为不耽误时间，有时带上一碗中饭，就地用餐。由于他５年如一日，早出晚归，修路不止，使韶峰公路平整如新、畅通无阻。乡邻们经常劝道：“三阿公，您年纪这么大了，只管吃您的五保，享您的清福罢了，不要管修路的事了。”章老总是乐呵呵地回答道“愚公移山我修路，９０不修待何时！过去守庙接‘香客’，那是迷信；现在修路接游客，这是好事，好事我要干到底。”
    章纯明老人义务修路不止的事迹在韶山传为佳话。去年重阳节，他被评为韶山区老人先进生产者。１２月２３日，省委领导熊清泉、刘正在参加毛泽东诞辰９５周年纪念活动之后，特意将他从修路工地上接到滴水洞，设宴款慰，祝福健康长寿，安度晚年。并约定为其题词立碑“以扬美德，以启世人”。
