Spring Festival is approaching, and nutritionist Ma Shushen reminds people to pay attention to their health. For the sake of health, people should change the past habit of "saving for a year and indulging for ten days" and avoid overeating during the festival.

Recently, Ma Shushen, who won the highest award in China's nutrition field—the Hou Xiangchuan Fund Teaching Award, is the deputy director of the Nutrition Research Office at North China Coal Medical University. She said that the Spring Festival is the most important traditional holiday in China, especially in rural areas. Many families start preparing a month in advance by slaughtering pigs and sheep and purchasing New Year's goods. From the first to the fifteenth day of the lunar New Year, almost every household in rural areas sets up large banquets to celebrate the festival and entertain relatives and friends. According to a sample survey, the average person in the eastern Hebei rural areas consumes about 1 kilogram of meat, fish, eggs, and other animal-based foods per day during the Spring Festival. This unscientific eating habit can be harmful to one's health.

Overeating can lead to various diseases. Most people in China usually consume rice, flour, vegetables, and soybean products as their main diet. However, during the festival, they suddenly switch to high-protein, high-fat foods, which makes it difficult for the digestive system to adapt. This can result in indigestion, diarrhea, pancreatitis, and toxic hepatitis. In recent years, during the Spring Festival, the number of inpatients in internal medicine departments has significantly increased. It is particularly important to note that overeating is especially harmful to the elderly. Last Spring Festival, an elderly farmer in the suburbs of Tangshan suffered from a heart attack due to overeating, which increased the burden on his heart. Despite emergency treatment, he died. Overeating also leads to significant waste. In recent years, during the Spring Festival, the average protein intake per person in the eastern Hebei rural areas has exceeded the actual need by more than three times, meaning that only about one-third of the nutrients are absorbed, and the rest is excreted from the body. However, during regular times, the proportion of animal-based foods is insufficient. From a nutritional perspective, it is better to have a balanced diet throughout the year rather than overeating during the festival. Eating a moderate amount of meat, fish, and eggs regularly makes the diet structure more reasonable and beneficial to health.

Professor Ma emphasized that most families are still at the subsistence level, but their living standards are gradually improving. We should promote a nutritional diet structure.

　　春节合家欢　饮食不能贪   
    营养学家提醒人们暴饮暴食不利健康
    新华社石家庄１月２５日电（通讯员白云水、记者郑战国）春节将近，营养学家马淑敏提醒人们注意，为健康起见，应当改变过去“节约一年，解馋１０天”的不良习惯，过节期间切不要大吃大喝，暴饮暴食。
    不久前获得我国营养学界最高奖——侯祥川基金教学奖的马淑敏，是华北煤炭医学院营养学教研室副主任。她说，春节是我国，特别是农村最受重视的传统节日，不少人家从一个月前就开始杀猪宰羊，购置年货。从正月初一到十五，在农村几乎家家大摆宴席，欢庆节日，款待亲朋。据抽样调查，冀东农村春节期间平均每人每天要吃１公斤左右的肉、鱼、蛋等动物性食品。这种不科学的饮食习惯，会给人的健康带来危害。
    暴饮暴食可能导致各种疾病。我国大多数的群众平时都是以米、面、蔬菜、豆制品等植物性食品为主，而过节期间突然改食高蛋白、高脂肪的食品，使人的消化系统一时难以适应，这样就会发生消化不良、腹泻以及胰腺炎、中毒性肝炎等疾病。近年来每到春节期间，医院里的内科病人就明显增多。特别应该提出的是，暴饮暴食对老年人的危害尤其严重。去年春节，唐山郊区有一位老农由于饮食过量，加重了心脏负担，造成急性心肌梗塞，经抢救无效而死亡。大吃大喝还明显地造成浪费。近年来，春节期间冀东农村人均摄入蛋白量超过实际需要的３倍多，也就是说，只有近１／３的营养被吸收，大部分被排出体外。但在平时，动物性食品占的比例则嫌不足。从营养学角度讲，年节大吃大喝，不如平时细水长流。平时经常吃一些肉、鱼、蛋，饮食结构才趋于合理，有利于身体健康。
    马教授强调说，目前大多数家庭还处于温饱型，但生活在逐步提高，我们应当提倡营养型的饮食结构。
