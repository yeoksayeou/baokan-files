The US and Soviet Union have agreed on a timeline for Middle East peace talks.

    By the end of 1989: The Soviet Union and Israel restore diplomatic relations, and free elections are held in the West Bank.
    By the end of 1990: An international peace conference for the Middle East is held.

    Xinhua News Agency, London, January 25 - Channel 4 in the UK reported tonight that the United States and the Soviet Union have reached a consensus on the agenda and schedule for an international peace conference in the Middle East.

    The report states that the US State Department, Israeli, and Palestinian officials have confirmed this peace plan, which has been preliminarily agreed upon by the US and the Soviet Union.

    These officials said that the peace conference, scheduled to be held in the spring of next year, will include representatives from the Palestine Liberation Organization (PLO). The agreed-upon agenda by the US and the Soviet Union includes: the United Nations will host the Middle East international peace conference; direct negotiations will be held, including the PLO; and free elections will be held in the occupied territories, allowing Palestinians to elect their own leaders.

    The timeline agreed upon by the US and the Soviet Union is: by December 1989, the Soviet Union and Israel will restore diplomatic relations, and free elections will begin in the West Bank; by the end of 1990, the Middle East international peace conference will be held.

    Channel 4 in the UK calls this plan the most significant peace initiative in a decade.

    １９９０年以前：举行中东国际和平会议
    新华社伦敦１月２５日电  英国电视四台今天晚上报道说，美国和苏联已就召开中东国际和平会议的议题和日程取得一致。
    报道说，美国国务院、以色列和巴勒斯坦人士证实了这项目前由美苏两国同意的和平计划。
    这些人士说，预计在明年春季召开的和平会议将包括巴解组织的代表。美苏两国取得一致的议题是：中东国际和平会议由联合国主持；举行包括巴解组织在内的直接谈判；在被占领区举行自由选举，使巴勒斯坦人能够选举他们自己的领导人。
    美苏两国确定的时间表是：１９８９年１２月前，苏联和以色列恢复关系，约旦河西岸开始自由选举；１９９０年前举行中东国际和平会议。
    英国电视四台称这项计划为１０年来最有意义的和平倡议。
