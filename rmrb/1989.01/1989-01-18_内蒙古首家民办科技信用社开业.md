The first private financial institution in Inner Mongolia—the Science and Technology Credit Union—officially opened in Hohhot on the 12th.

This credit union was jointly established by more than 10 research institutions, including the Inner Mongolia General Applied Science Development Center, with collective funds. It handles deposits, loans, remittances, trust services, securities, and public savings for scientific research departments. The credit union operates under the leadership of the People's Bank of China, practices independent accounting, and operates autonomously.

During its two-month trial operation, the credit union has already accumulated 300,000 yuan in funds, providing financial services for scientific research in more than 10 factories, mines, and research institutes.
