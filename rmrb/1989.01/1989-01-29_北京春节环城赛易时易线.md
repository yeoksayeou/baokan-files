Beijing's traditional mass activity, the Beijing Spring Festival City Circuit Race, will be renamed the Beijing Spring Marathon starting this year. This mass sports event has been held for 25 times over the past 32 years. However, in recent years, the number of participants in this city circuit race has been declining. Beijing will not hold the city circuit race during this year's Spring Festival. Instead, it will be held on March 26, a Sunday with relatively high temperatures. The Beijing Spring Marathon will feature four events: men's and women's 5-kilometer and 10-kilometer races.

　　北京春节环城赛易时易线
    新华社北京１月２８日电（记者王岳龙）北京市传统群体活动——北京春节环城赛今年起将改为北京春季长跑比赛。这项群众性体育活动，在过去的３２年中共进行了２５届。但近年来，热衷于参加这一环城赛跑的人数却呈下降趋势。北京市今年春节将不举行环城赛跑，改在３月２６日气温较高的星期天举办。北京春季长跑比赛，设男、女５公里和１０公里４个比赛项目。
