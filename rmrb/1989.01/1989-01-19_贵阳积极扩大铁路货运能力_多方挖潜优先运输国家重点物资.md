Guiyang Railway Bureau, facing a "high starting point, heavy tasks, and great pressure" situation, has actively taken measures to tap into potential resources and expand its transportation capacity.

In recent years, the volume of goods accumulated in Guizhou Province for external transportation has been increasing at a rate of more than 10% per year. The situation where industrial and mining enterprises in the province rely on transportation to determine production is particularly prominent nationwide, severely constraining the development of enterprise production. To address this, the Guiyang Railway Bureau has decided to take the following measures this year:

	— Strictly enforce regulations and discipline. Insist on collective approval of extra-plan wagon allocations to ensure the priority transportation of state key materials and planned materials. The Bureau Party Committee has specifically stipulated that leaders must manage themselves, their family members, and their staff, and not use their power for personal gain.

	— Actively tap into potential resources and expand capacity, ensuring that measures are implemented. Organize direct, fast, and oversized trains, fully utilize the idle capacity of the Guiyang-Kunming line, and organize goods to enter Yunnan or bypass Yunnan to enter Sichuan. To ensure the transportation of coal and the supply of raw materials to major factories and mines, the Bureau has decided to strengthen the allocation and management of more than 500 self-owned wagons from factories and mines within and outside the province, increasing the turnover rate of these wagons to free up more wagons for the transportation of goods out of the province.

	— Strongly support agriculture. Agricultural materials are given "three priorities": priority in plan approval, priority in loading, and priority in fast transportation.

	— Prioritize transportation for impoverished counties. Important living materials such as grain, petroleum, and salt urgently needed by impoverished counties are given priority and guaranteed in transportation.

　　贵阳积极扩大铁路货运能力
    多方挖潜优先运输国家重点物资
    本报贵阳电  记者潘帝都、胡跃平报道：贵阳铁路分局面对“起点高、任务重、压力大”的严峻局面，积极采取措施，多方挖潜，以扩大运输能力。
    近几年来，贵州省外运物资积压量以每年１０％以上的速度上升。全省的工矿企业以运定产的状况在全国尤为突出，严重制约了企业生产的发展。为此，贵铁分局决定今年采取以下措施：
    ——严格制度，严肃纪律。坚持集体审批计划外车皮的制度，确保国家重点物资和计划内物资的优先运输。分局党委特别作出规定，领导干部要管好自己，管好家属，管好身边工作人员，不以权谋私。
    ——积极挖潜扩能，并确保措施落实。大力组织直达、快速和超轴列车，充分利用贵昆线闲置的运能，组织货物进滇，或经滇绕道入川。为确保电煤运输和主要厂矿企业的原材料供应，分局决定对省内外厂矿企业的５００多辆经营型自备车加强调配、管理，增加这些车皮的周转次数，以腾出更多的车皮装运出省物资。
    ——大力支援农业。支农物资“三优先”。优先审批计划，优先进站上车，优先安排运力快运。
    ——在运输上重点照顾贫困县。贫困县急需的粮食、石油、食盐等重要生活物资，运输上优先安排、重点保证。
