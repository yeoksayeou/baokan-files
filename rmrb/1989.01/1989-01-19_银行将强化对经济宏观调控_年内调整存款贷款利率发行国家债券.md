	Banks to Strengthen Macroeconomic Control:
	Adjust Deposit and Loan Interest Rates, Issue National Bonds

	Our reporter Dong Huanliang reports: On January 18, Vice Governor of the People's Bank of China, Liu Hongru, conveyed the opinions of the State Council leaders. In the rectification and adjustment over the next two years, the country needs to rely on banks to strengthen economic regulation, gradually establishing an effective financial macro-control system and a new socialist financial order.

	Recently, the State Council leaders listened to the report of the national meeting of the heads of the People's Bank of China branches, affirming the achievements of financial work and proposing the principles, policies, and requirements for financial work this year.

	At the meeting, representatives believed that achieving the credit and monetary control targets this year would require overcoming difficulties and obstacles. Currently, some regions have not genuinely reduced construction projects, and the pursuit of speed remains unabated. Consumption funds have not been controlled. Especially now, two "external circulations" have emerged: first, after the bank tightened cash management, enterprises and units do not deposit their cash income into the bank; second, as bank loans are tightly controlled, various local governments and enterprises issue bonds, raise funds, lend to each other, and establish financial institutions to raise funds, with a strong momentum. If measures are not taken promptly to correct this, it will disrupt the financial order and increase the difficulty of financial macro-control.

	At the closing ceremony, Liu Hongru emphasized the policy measures for macro-control using financial means:

	Regarding the adjustment of interest rates: To address the issue of interest rates being significantly lower than the price index, it is necessary to adjust the interest rates for deposits and loans of a certain term. In the future, interest rates will be adjusted according to the situation, gradually increasing the role of interest rate leverage in regulating fund demand and curbing inflation.

	Regarding the issuance of bonds: The state will issue a certain amount of bonds to society. Enterprises, units, individuals, local finances, and non-bank financial institutions can all subscribe. Banks should do a good job in the agency issuance work.

	Regarding social fundraising: Before the issuance of national bonds is completed this year, regions and enterprises are not allowed to issue bonds or raise funds under any name for fixed asset investments; for the working capital needed by enterprises, with the approval of the People's Bank, short-term bonds of one year or less can be issued.

	Regarding the adjustment of credit structure: Various levels of government should focus on adjusting the industrial structure, product structure, and enterprise structure, deeply carry out inventory reduction and potential excavation, and cooperate with financial departments to adjust the credit structure.

	Regarding strengthening financial management: Gradually replace unorganized financing activities with an organized financial market. Clean up and rectify trust investment institutions, and prohibit trust investment companies from engaging in non-planned fixed asset investments.

	Liu Hongru also pointed out that with the Spring Festival approaching, it is necessary to strictly control the issuance of currency, control consumption funds, and at the same time, organize the supply of market goods during the Spring Festival, striving to recover as much currency as possible.

　　银行将强化对经济宏观调控
    年内调整存款贷款利率发行国家债券
    本报讯  记者董焕亮报道：１月１８日，中国人民银行副行长刘鸿儒传达了国务院领导同志的意见，在今明两年的治理、整顿中，国家需要依靠银行强化对经济的调节，要逐步建立起有效的金融宏观调控体系和新型的社会主义金融新秩序。
    国务院领导同志最近听取了中国人民银行全国分行长会议的汇报，肯定了金融工作的成绩，提出了今年金融工作的方针、政策和要求。
    在会议上，代表们认为今年实现信贷、货币控制目标，要克服困难和阻力。目前，部分地区基建没有真正压，有的还在上，追求速度的劲头未减，消费基金没有控制住。特别是现在出现两个“体外循环”，一是银行现金管紧后，企业、单位收入的现金不交银行；二是银行贷款控制紧了，各地政府、企业以各种名目发债券、集资、相互借贷、组建金融机构筹措资金，来势很猛。如不及时采取措施纠正，会干扰金融秩序，增加金融宏观调控的难度。
    在会议闭幕式上，刘鸿儒重点讲了运用金融手段进行宏观调控的政策措施：
    关于调整利率：为解决利率总水平明显低于物价指数，需要调整一定期限以上的存款和贷款利率。今后，将根据情况不断调整利率，逐步加大利率杠杆对调节资金需求和抑制通货膨胀的作用。
    关于发行债券：国家将面向社会发行一定数额的债券，企业、单位、个人、地方财政和非银行金融机构都可认购。银行要认真做好代理发行工作。
    关于社会集资：今年发行国家债券完成以前，各地区、各企业不准发行债券或以任何名义集资搞固定资产投资；对企业需要的流动资金，经人民银行批准，可发行一年期以内的短期债券。
    关于调整信贷结构：各级政府要抓好调整产业结构、产品结构和企业结构的工作，深入开展清仓挖潜，配合金融部门调整信贷结构。
    关于加强金融管理：要用有组织的金融市场逐步取代无组织的融资活动。清理整顿信托投资机构，禁止信托投资公司搞计划外固定资产投资。
    刘鸿儒还指出，春节将临，要严格控制货币投放，控制消费基金，同时大力组织好春节期间的市场商品供应，争取多回笼一些货币。
