The PLO's Paris news liaison office is set to be upgraded. On the 5th, French President Mitterrand announced at a New Year press conference that France is prepared to elevate the PLO's news liaison office in Paris to the status of a "mission," although it will not enjoy diplomatic privileges.

Mitterrand explained that France only recognizes countries that have territory, and therefore it cannot grant the PLO mission diplomatic privileges, especially diplomatic immunity. However, he added that the recent Algiers Declaration issued by the PLO cannot be ignored.

　　巴解驻巴黎新闻联络处将升格
    法国总统密特朗五日在新年记者招待会上宣布，法国准备将巴解组织设在巴黎的新闻联络处升格为“代表团”的地位，但它不享有外交特权。
    密特朗解释说，法国只承认拥有领土的国家，因此，它不能授予巴解组织代表处以外交特权，特别是外交豁免权。但是他又说，对于巴解组织最近发表的阿尔及尔宣言，人们不能不重视。
