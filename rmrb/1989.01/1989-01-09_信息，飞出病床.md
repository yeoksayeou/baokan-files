He—Li Wenhua from Zhaozhuo Village, Machao Township, Zhouzhi County, Shaanxi Province—has been bedridden for ten years. This 28-year-old disabled youth, who, except for a right hand that can move within a limited range, has all other limbs completely stiffened and can only lie flat on the bed, has set up an information service station on his sickbed. This station, which is quite influential in the nationwide private information network, has provided over 2,900 pieces of information to users across the country, of which 380 have been adopted, creating an economic benefit of over 2.8 million yuan!

Li Wenhua loved reading books since he was young and was always rated as an outstanding student by his school. Just as he was steadily advancing on the smooth path of life, rheumatoid arthritis quietly attacked him. First, his knees ached, his ankles were displaced, and then his legs stopped listening to his commands. By 1979, with bone hyperplasia, calcification of the bones, and stiffening of the spine, he was completely bedridden.

Fate was too cruel to Li Wenhua. Countless sleepless nights, he sighed at life and lamented his misfortune. "Since nature has not given me a colorful life, why should I cling to it?" he thought of leaving this world and sleeping forever. But when he stood at the crossroads of life and death, he hesitated: should I just disappear silently? he asked himself. Suddenly, Pavel, Wu Yunduo, and Zhang Haidi stood before him. Li Wenhua woke up: he must not die; he must live and be a strong person like them!

"China is a big country, but its information system is very backward." This comment from a foreign expert has been lingering in Li Wenhua's mind. Indeed, product backlogs, business failures, technological backwardness... aren't all these related to the lack of information? Yes, set up an information service station and let information serve society.

In 1985, Li Wenhua had his family exchange the eggs they had saved for science and technology information newspapers and magazines. He spent day and night wandering in the ocean of information, searching for urgently needed information targets. To ensure that the screened and organized information could quickly serve society, he borrowed steel plates and iron pens and wrote them himself. For ordinary people, writing information materials on steel plates with an iron pen is not a big deal, but for Li Wenhua, who can only lie flat on the bed, it is a particularly difficult task. The steel plate can only be placed upright on his chest, then he uses his uncooperative left hand to hold the steel plate, and with his stiff right hand, he writes one stroke at a time. His eyes hurt, his fingers went numb, his arm swelled, and in an hour, he could only write sixty to seventy characters. Like this, he gritted his teeth, endured the pain, wrote a bit, rested a bit, day and night without stopping.

After Li Wenhua's handwritten and printed information materials were published in newspapers and on the radio, letters requesting information from all over the country flew in like snowflakes. He established information exchange relationships with more than 200 information units in over 20 provinces, municipalities, and autonomous regions across the country, providing thousands of pieces of scientific and economic information to hundreds of enterprises and specialized households nationwide.

Li Wenhua succeeded. He is not only famous in the province but also people from Guangxi, Henan, Hubei, Shandong, and other places come to seek information from him. One summer day in 1987, a car drove to Li Wenhua's door. The director and manager of the Luoyang Bicycle Factory in Henan Province came specially to obtain information materials for the planned production of full-channel TV converters. When they saw that the person providing such important information was a disabled youth lying in bed, they were deeply moved and tears flowed down their cheeks. Farmer Han Yangcai from Zhuangtou Township, Xingping County, Shaanxi Province, used the "internal fat tofu technology" information provided by Li Wenhua to produce 6 kilograms of tofu from 1 kilogram of soybeans, becoming the famous "tofu champion" in the area. From these feedback messages, Li Wenhua felt gratified and proud: he was still a useful person!

The vicious disease continued to gnaw at Li Wenhua's body, and he even felt that his days in this world were numbered. But he did not despair, nor did he shed tears. Instead, he seized the limited time to engage in his career. He used the meager income from his information services to purchase printing equipment, a radio, and subscribe to many more newspapers and magazines. Every day, he wrote without stopping, and then sent the information to all directions...

### 信息，飞出病床

　　信息，飞出病床
    张伟
    他——陕西省周至县马召乡枣村的李文华，瘫痪在床已经十年了。就是这位除了一只只能在有限范围内活动的右手外，其余肢体已全部僵硬，只能仰卧在床的２８岁的残疾青年，却在他的病床上办起了在全国民办信息网络中颇有影响的信息服务站，为各地用户提供信息２９００多条，被采用３８０多条，创造经济效益２８０多万元！
    李文华从小爱读书，年年被学校评为优秀生。正当他在平坦的人生路上一步步前进时，类风湿病却悄悄地向他袭来，先是双膝疼痛，双踝移位，继而两条腿不听使唤，到１９７９年，骨质增生、骨骼钙化、脊椎僵硬，就完全瘫痪在床了。
    命运对李文华太不幸了。多少个不眠之夜，他叹人生，悲坎坷。“既然大自然没有赋予我多彩的生活，我为何又要留恋于它呢？”他想离开这个世界，永远永远地睡去。可是，当他来到生与死的十字路口时，却又徘徊不前：难道就这样无声无息地走了吗？他问自己。刹那间，保尔、吴运铎、张海迪一个个站在了他的面前。李文华猛醒了：不能死，要活着，要像他们那样做一个生活的强者！
    “中国是个大国，而信息系统却非常落后。”这是外国一位专家对中国的评论。这评论一直在李文华的脑海里翻腾着。是啊，产品积压、生意失败、技术落后……这一切不都与信息不灵有关吗？对，办一个信息服务站，让信息为社会服务。
    １９８５年，李文华让家里人把平时积攒下的鸡蛋换成了科技信息报刊。他夜以继日地漫游在信息的海洋里，搜寻着急需发现的信息目标。为了使筛选整理出的信息尽快服务于社会，他借来了钢板和铁笔，自己动手刻写。用铁笔在钢板上刻写信息资料，这对一般人来说算不了什么，但对只能仰卧床上的李文华来讲，却是件特别困难的事。钢板，只能竖放在胸脯上，然后，用不听使唤的左手扶住钢板，再用转动不灵的右手一笔一画地刻写。眼睛瞅疼了，手指攥麻了，胳膊抬肿了，一个小时下来，也只能刻写六七十个字。就这样，他咬着牙，忍着痛，刻一会，停一会，昼夜不分地刻着，写着。
    李文华刻写油印的信息资料通过报纸、电台公布后，全国各地的求函信像雪片般地飞来。他和全国２０多个省、市、自治区的２００多个信息单位建立了信息往来关系，为全国几百家企业和专业户提供了上千条科技和经济信息。
    李文华成功了。他不仅在省内有名，就连广西、河南、湖北、山东等地的人也慕名前来索取信息。１９８７年初夏的一天，一辆轿车驶到李文华的门前，河南省洛阳市自行车厂的厂长、经理专程前来索取计划转产的电视全频道转换器的信息资料。当他们看到提供这样重大信息的竟是一位病瘫在床的残疾青年时，不由得激动万分，热泪沾襟。陕西兴平县庄头镇农民韩养财，用李文华提供的“内脂豆腐技术”资料，１公斤黄豆做出了６公斤豆腐，成为当地有名的“豆腐状元”。从这些反馈回来的喜讯中，李文华感到欣慰，感到自豪：我还是一个有用的人！
    凶狠的病魔继续蚕食着李文华的身躯，他甚至觉得自己活在世上的日子不长了。可是他没有悲观，没有流泪，而是抓紧有限的时间，从事自己的事业。他用微薄的信息服务收入，添置了油印设备，购买了收录机，增订了许多报刊，每天不停地刻着，写着，然后把信息发往四面八方……
