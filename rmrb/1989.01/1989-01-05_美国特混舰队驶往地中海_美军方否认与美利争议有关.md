U.S. Carrier Strike Group Sails to the Mediterranean
U.S. Military Denies Connection to U.S.-Libya Dispute

New York Times, January 3 — The Pentagon spokesman, Howard, said today that a U.S. carrier strike group, consisting of one aircraft carrier, 12 warships, and 2,000 marines, is currently heading to the Mediterranean.

The defense department spokesman said that the U.S.'s newest nuclear-powered aircraft carrier, the "Theodore Roosevelt," departed from Norfolk Harbor last Friday to head to the Mediterranean to replace the "John F. Kennedy," which is currently on duty there. He denied that this action is related to Libya's "chemical weapons factory."

The U.S. State Department spokesman, Charles Redman, today accused Libya of producing chemical weapons in a factory located more than 80 kilometers from its capital, Tripoli. However, Libya stated that the factory only produces pharmaceuticals and does not produce chemical weapons.

Last month, U.S. President Reagan warned that the U.S. is discussing the possibility of military action with its allies to destroy Libya's chemical weapons factory. However, he also said that no decision has been made yet.

In this context, the actions of the "Theodore Roosevelt" aircraft carrier have led to speculation that the U.S. may take retaliatory action against Libya.

When asked if the U.S. plans to destroy Libya's chemical factory, Howard said, "We do not discuss future military actions." He also said, "Libya's imminent ability to produce chemical weapons has greatly concerned us."

A spokesman for the U.S. Navy said that the Roosevelt aircraft carrier battle group will arrive in the Mediterranean within a week.

　　美国特混舰队驶往地中海
    美军方否认与美利争议有关
    新华社华盛顿１月３日电  美国五角大楼发言人霍华德今天说，由一艘航空母舰、１２艘军舰和２０００名海军陆战队队员组成的一支美国特混舰队现正驰往地中海。
    这位国防部发言人说，美国最新的核动力航空母舰“西奥多·罗斯福”号已于上星期五离开诺福克港前往地中海，以替换在那里执勤的航空母舰“约翰·肯尼迪”号。他否认这次行动同利比亚的“化学武器工厂”有关。
    美国国务院发言人查理斯·雷德曼今天指责利比亚在距其首都的黎波里８０多公里处的一家工厂生产化学武器。但利比亚说，这家工厂只生产药品，而不生产化学武器。
    美国总统里根上个月警告说，美国正同其盟国讨论采取军事行动的可能性，以摧毁利比亚化学武器工厂。但他又说，还没有就此作出决定。
    在此情况下，“西奥多·罗斯福”号航空母舰的行动使人猜测美国可能将对利比亚采取报复行动。
    当被问到美国是否计划摧毁利比亚化工厂时，霍华德说，“我们不讨论今后的军事行动问题。”他还说，“利比亚即将拥有生产化学武器的能力，引起了我们极大的关注。”
    美国海军的一位发言人说，罗斯福号航空母舰战斗群将在一周内抵达地中海。
