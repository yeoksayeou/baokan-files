NATO Secretary-General Emphasizes Modernization of Short-Range Missiles

West Germany Rejects Unilateral Western Disarmament

BEIJING, Jan. 28 (Xinhua) -- NATO Secretary-General Werner recently told West German "Sunday World" that NATO must possess a minimum level of modernized short-range nuclear weapons.

Werner said that Western leaders had reached a consensus on this issue in March last year, but a binding date for the modernization of weapons has not yet been set. Werner said he was surprised by the internal debate within NATO over the modernization of Pershing missiles. He added that the modernization of short-range missiles deployed in East Germany, replacing outdated Frog missiles with SS-21 missiles, has not raised any concerns.

BEIJING, Jan. 28 (Xinhua) -- The West German government has demanded that Warsaw Pact countries provide detailed explanations of their announced unilateral disarmament measures and has rejected calls for the West to take similar unilateral disarmament steps.

West German government spokesman Ost today in Bonn said that Warsaw Pact countries should specify the exact numbers, initial levels of armaments, and the time frame for disarmament. This would make the disarmament steps more credible and help build trust.

Ost said that achieving European security is not about "a race in the number of disarmament," but rather about maintaining a balance of the remaining forces. Therefore, what is important is not the balance in the number of reductions, but the balance in the remaining strength. Even if the East implements the announced steps, it will still maintain a clear advantage.

BEIJING, Jan. 27 (Xinhua) -- West German Foreign Minister Genscher today, during a debate in the Bundestag on the 1989 disarmament report, said that as East-West relations continue to improve, the prospects for disarmament are also increasing.

Genscher said that on March 6, full-scale conventional disarmament talks will begin in Vienna. The basis for these talks, the principle of asymmetric reduction of armaments, has been accepted by the Soviet Union.

Genscher also said that although the unilateral disarmament steps announced by the Soviet Union will reduce the East's advantage, they are not enough to eliminate it. He believes that in the sought-after European peace order, the West German Federal Defense Force is "indispensable."

### 北约秘书长强调短导现代化  西德拒绝西方单方面裁军

　　北约秘书长强调短导现代化
    西德拒绝西方单方面裁军
    新华社波恩１月２８日电  北约秘书长韦尔纳最近在接受西德《星期日世界报》记者采访时强调北约必须拥有最低限度的现代化短程核武器。
    韦尔纳说，西方国家领导人已在去年３月对此达成了一致，至于实现武器现代化的一个有约束力的日期尚未确定。韦尔纳说，北约内部关于长矛导弹现代化问题的争论使他感到吃惊。他又说，而部署在民主德国的短程导弹现代化，并用ＳＳ—２１型导弹取代过时的蛙式导弹，却没有人对此表示不安。
    新华社波恩１月２８日电　西德政府要求华沙条约国家准确地阐明业已宣布的单方面裁军措施，并拒绝西方应采取同样单方面裁军步骤的要求。
    西德政府发言人奥斯特今天在波恩发表声明说，华约国家应当说明裁军的具体数字、军备的起始数值和裁军的时间跨度，这样一来可以使裁军步骤变得更加可信并有助于建立信任。
    奥斯特说，实现欧洲的安全不是通过“在裁军数量上的竞赛”，而是通过留存下来的力量均衡。因此重要的并不是裁减数量的均衡，而是留存下来的实力的均衡。即使东方实现了业已宣布的步骤，还仍然占有明显的优势。
    新华社波恩１月２７日电　西德外长根舍今天在联邦议院辩论１９８９年裁军报告时说，随着东西方关系的不断改善，裁军的希望也与日俱增。
    根舍说，３月６日将开始在维也纳举行全欧常规裁军谈判。这一谈判的基础，即非对称地减少军备，原则上已被苏联认可。
    根舍还说，苏联已经宣布的单方面裁军步骤虽然将减少东方的优势，但还不足消除优势。他认为，在所谋求的欧洲和平秩序中，西德联邦国防军是“不可放弃的”。
