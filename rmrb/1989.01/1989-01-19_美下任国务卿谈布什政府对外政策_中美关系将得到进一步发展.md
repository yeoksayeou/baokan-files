Next U.S. Secretary of State James Baker said today that developing U.S.-China relations is not only important for both countries but also greatly contributes to the overall stability of the international political order. He believes that U.S.-China relations will further develop during the Bush administration.

Baker made these remarks at a hearing of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee. At the hearing, the incoming Secretary of State comprehensively elaborated on the foreign policy of the next U.S. administration.

Baker said that the current world situation is undergoing "significant changes," and the United States must adopt a "realistic attitude" toward international affairs.

When discussing U.S. policy toward the Asia-Pacific region, he said that the United States must emphasize an outward-looking economic policy aimed at promoting trade and development. "The United States should do its utmost to ensure economic growth in the region, as this growth has global significance for the United States in achieving reliable economic deterrence."

When discussing U.S.-Soviet relations, Baker said that the United States should continue to welcome reforms and changes in the Soviet Union and understand the Soviet Union's stance on issues such as arms reduction, human rights, regional conflicts, and bilateral relations. He said that the United States is willing to cooperate and negotiate with the Soviet Union to make progress in various areas.

He said that the Soviet Union remains a "fully armed superpower" and is still implementing many policies that are hostile and threatening to the United States and its allies. Therefore, despite changes in the Soviet Union, the United States must remain vigilant.

On the Middle East issue, Baker acknowledged that U.S. dialogue with the PLO will promote the peace process in the Middle East. He expressed his willingness to continue efforts to facilitate direct negotiations among the various factions in the Middle East conflicts.

Baker expressed satisfaction with the peaceful resolution of the Southwest African issue. He said that the recent agreements on Namibian independence and the withdrawal of Cuban and South African troops from Angola are "encouraging progress." However, he claimed that the United States will continue to support the anti-government National Union for the Total Independence of Angola (UNITA) until national reconciliation is achieved in Angola.

At the hearing, the incoming U.S. Secretary of State also called on Republicans and Democrats to adopt a cooperative attitude in dealing with Central American issues. He said that over the past decade, the United States has implemented a "disappointing, sometimes even contradictory" policy in Central America, and this situation should be changed.

　　美下任国务卿谈布什政府对外政策
    中美关系将得到进一步发展
    新华社华盛顿１月１７日电  美国下任国务卿詹姆斯·贝克今天说，发展美中关系不仅对两国本身很重要，“而且大大有助于国际政治秩序的全面稳定”。他相信，美中关系在布什执政期间将得到进一步发展。
    贝克是在参议院外交委员会的一个听证会上说这番话的。在听证会上，这位即将上任的国务卿全面阐述了下届美国政府的对外政策。
    贝克说，当今的世界形势正在发生“重大的转变”，美国必须对国际事务采取“现实主义的态度”。
    在谈到美国对亚太地区的政策时，他说，美国同太平洋地区的关系“必须强调旨在促进贸易和发展的外向型经济政策”，“美国应竭尽全力确保该地区的经济增长，因为这一增长对于美国取得可靠的经济威慑力量具有全球性的意义。”
    在谈到美苏关系时，贝克说，美国应当继续欢迎苏联的改革与变化，了解苏联在裁军、人权、地区冲突和双边关系等问题上的立场。他说，美国愿意同苏联进行合作与谈判，以争取在各个方面取得进展。
    他说，苏联仍是一个“全副武装的超级大国”，目前仍在执行许多敌视和威胁美国及其盟国的政策。因此，尽管苏联在发生变化，美国仍需保持警惕。
    在中东问题上，贝克承认美国同巴解组织的对话将推动中东和平的进程。他表示要为中东地区冲突中的各派开展直接谈判而继续努力。
    贝克对西南部非洲问题的和平解决表示满意。他说，最近达成的关于纳米比亚独立及古巴和南非从安哥拉撤军的协议是“令人鼓舞的进展”。但他声称，在安哥拉没有实现民族和解之前，美国将继续支持反政府的争取安哥拉彻底独立全国联盟。
    在听证会上，这位美国下任国务卿还呼吁共和党与民主党采取合作的态度来处理中美洲问题。他说，近１０年来，美国在中美洲实行了“另人沮丧、有时甚至是相互矛盾”的政策，这种情况应予以改变。
