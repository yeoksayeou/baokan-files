The Jídì Number scientific research vessel arrived at an anchorage just two kilometers from the shore at 00:20 local time (03:20 Beijing time) today, thus ending nearly 20 days of being besieged by ice.

All members of the expedition team were overjoyed. Crew members on the ship gathered at the railing to look out at the Zhōngshān Station site. Team members who had already arrived at the site to conduct scientific research also celebrated by lighting colorful fireworks.

The Jídì Number returned to the Lasmann Hills continental ice zone on the 10th. Today, the ice conditions have significantly improved, with large ice bodies of one or two square kilometers no longer present, replaced by floating ice blocks the size of basketball courts. Although the research vessel is still hindered by floating ice and progressing slowly, it can now sail forward relatively smoothly.

According to experts, the sudden breakup of the Lasmann Hills continental ice into smaller floating ice blocks is primarily due to the action of a small cyclone in the area.

The arrival of the Jídì Number at the anchorage does not mean that supplies can be unloaded and the station can be built immediately. This is because from the anchorage to the shore, there is still a layer of sea ice up to one meter thick. For the expedition team, which only has simple ice-breaking tools such as steel picks and large hammers, it will be quite difficult to open a channel for the barge to pass through.

### 极地号冲破冰围到达锚地  距陆岸还有两公里需要继续凿冰前进

　　极地号冲破冰围到达锚地
    距陆岸还有两公里需要继续凿冰前进
    新华社“极地”号１月１１日卫星传真电  （记者张继民）我“极地”号科学考察船今日当地时间零点２０分（北京时间早晨３点２０分），到达距陆岸仅有两公里的锚地，从而结束了近２０天被冰缘围困的逆境。
    考察队的全体队员无不为此感到欢欣鼓舞。船上的同志，纷纷来到船舷瞭望中山站站址。已在站址进行科学考察的队员，也高兴得燃起缤纷的焰火。
    极地号是１０日重返拉斯曼丘陵陆缘冰区的，今天陆缘冰情已大为好转，一两平方公里的大冰体已不复存在，均被篮球场大小的块状浮冰所替代。考察船虽然仍受浮冰阻挡，行进缓慢，但可以较顺利地向前航行了。
    据专家们说，拉斯曼丘陵陆缘冰突然化解成小块浮冰，主要是当地产生的小气旋作用的结果。
    “极地”号船到达锚地，并不意味着马上就可以卸运物资建站。因为从锚地到陆岸，仍然布满着厚达一米的海冰，这对于只有钢钎、大锤等简单破冰工具的考察队来说，要开出一条可供驳船通行的航道，还相当困难。
