In traditional opera and storytelling, the empress dowager of the Khitan state, Xiao, is always portrayed as the villain of aggression. This image reflects an outdated historical view and narrow national psychology, which naturally does not resonate with modern people. In the first China Drama Festival, the Changchun Yuyang Opera Troupe's performance of "The Soul of the Khitan" created a completely new image of Empress Dowager Xiao, adding luster to the opera stage.

In the play "The Soul of the Khitan," Empress Dowager Xiao appears as the embodiment of the spirit of the Khitan people. In creating this character, the author portrays the Khitan as an integral part of the Chinese nation and Empress Dowager Xiao as an outstanding politician from China's ethnic minorities, thereby affirming and praising her contributions to her own people and to Chinese history. This gives the character a new meaning.

The author captures the two fundamental elements that determine Empress Dowager Xiao's character: she is both a female politician and a politician who is a woman. Based on this, the play showcases her unique behavior and reveals her rich inner world.

Empress Dowager Xiao, for the prosperity of her people and to consolidate her own rule, boldly and decisively breaks the feudal lords' boundaries, frees slaves, and revises the legal code. She also overcomes ethnic prejudices and actively absorbs the advanced culture of the Han people. In the play, this is mainly shown through her trust and reliance on the Han official, Prime Minister Han Delet.

The work shows that Empress Dowager Xiao's success depends not only on her progressive political views but also on her personal qualities as a successful politician. Some of her proposals face strong resistance from old forces. Since these conservative forces include her sister, Princess Qi, and her father, Northern Duke Xiao Siwen, the conflicts are particularly sharp and complex. Empress Dowager Xiao decisively, calmly, and cleverly foils her opponents' schemes one by one. In particular, when she is poisoned by Princess Qi and feigns death, using the funeral to capture her enemy, it is particularly dramatic, fully demonstrating her unpredictable political strategies and resolute character.

As a woman, Empress Dowager Xiao has a rich emotional world, which includes both maternal love and romantic love. In her youth, she had a romantic relationship with the Han scholar Han Delet, which was interrupted when she was selected to enter the palace. However, she always treasured the jade flute given to her as a token of their love. When she assumes the regency as the Empress Dowager, she wants to relive that past love! The rekindled old love, suppressed and thus more intense, and her position of authority in the emotional realm also show an unchallengeable authority, meaning that she insists on reclaiming her lost love in her own unique way. However, in the realm of emotions, there is no acknowledgment of royal power, let alone the fact that Han Delet is no longer her past lover. He bears the heavy responsibility of implementing new laws and is strictly bound by feudal ethics and morality, as well as the constraints of royal etiquette, making him unwilling to cross the line. Political risks and emotional torment intertwine, simultaneously troubling this queen; however, in both realms, she plays the role of a strong person, simultaneously plotting to achieve her goals. These actions are both justified and not without blame.

We see that whether as a politician or as a woman, Empress Dowager Xiao lives according to her own character and behavior patterns. Her distinct personality and complex inner world make this character realistic and believable, creating a unique aesthetic value. The success of this character gives us an important lesson: that is, when creating ethnic minority historical figures, playwrights should first have a strong modern consciousness, and modern consciousness in the historical field is manifested as a great national cultural consciousness. In other words, modern consciousness in observing historical figures is the premise for creating a new image of Empress Dowager Xiao that is different from traditional opera and conforms to modern people's values and aesthetic evaluations. Because this image conforms to the materialist view of history and modern aesthetic principles, it can be accepted by audiences of all ethnicities and produce its aesthetic effects.

　　是政治家也是女人
    ——谈《契丹魂》中萧太后形象塑造
    孟繁树
    在传统戏曲和评书中，辽邦国主萧太后都是作为侵略元凶的形象出现的。这一形象所体现的陈旧的历史观和狭隘的民族心理，自然不为现代人所取。在首届中国戏剧节中，长春评剧院演出的《契丹魂》则塑造了一个全新的萧太后形象，为戏曲舞台增添了光彩。
    在《契》剧中，萧太后是作为契丹民族之魂的体现者而出现的。在塑造这一形象时，作者将契丹作为中华民族的一个组成部分，将萧太后作为中国历史上少数民族的一位杰出的政治家，从而肯定和赞扬了她对本民族和中国历史所做的贡献。这样便使笔下人物具有了新的意蕴。
    作者抓住了决定萧太后性格的两个基本因素，那就是身为女人的政治家和身为政治家的女人，在此基础上展示其行为的独特方式，揭示其丰富的内心世界。
    萧太后为了民族昌盛，也为了巩固自己的统治地位，大胆而又坚决地打破王公贵族的封疆，开脱奴隶，修订刑法。她还能克服民族偏见，积极地吸收汉民族的先进文化。在剧中，这一点主要是通过萧太后对汉人出身的大丞相韩德让的重用和不疑来体现的。
    作品显示出，萧太后的成功既取决于她的政治主张的进步性，又取决于她所具备的作为成功的政治家的个人素质。萧太后的一些主张受到旧势力的顽强抵抗。由于这些守旧势力既有她的姐姐齐王妃，又利用了她的父亲北府丞相萧思温，所以矛盾异常尖锐复杂。萧太后果断、沉着、机敏地挫败了对手的一个个阴谋，其中在遭到齐王妃的暗算时诈死，利用灵堂吊丧而智擒敌手，尤其具有戏剧性，充分表现了她那奇谲莫测的政治谋略和刚毅的性格。
    作为女人，萧太后有着丰富的感情世界，这之中既有母子之情，又有恋人之情。在青春时代，她曾与汉人公子韩德让有恋情，这种爱情因她被选入宫中而中断。但是她一直珍藏着当初的定情之物玉屏箫，当她以承天皇太后的身份奉遗诏摄政时，她又要重温那逝去的旧梦！复发的旧情因为受到压抑而更加炽烈，而君临一切的地位在感情领域也显示出使人必须接受的权威，这就是说，她要以自己的独特方式不容分说地追回她失去的爱。然而在感情世界里是不承认君主的权力的，何况韩德让已不是她过去的情人，他肩负着推行新法的重任，又受着封建伦理道德的严格规范，加之君臣之礼的约束，使他不肯越雷池一步。政治风险与感情煎熬交织在一起，同时困扰着这位女王；然而在这两个领域内她都扮演着强者的角色，同时施展着谋算，以达到其目的。这些行为既是有理由的，又不是无可指责的。
    我们看到，无论是作为政治家还是作为女人，萧太后都按照自己性格逻辑和行为方式在生活，鲜明的个性和复杂的内涵，使这一形象真实可信，产生一种独特的审美价值。这一形象的成功给我们一个重要的启示，那就是剧作家在塑造少数民族的历史人物时，首先应该具备强烈的现代意识，而现代意识在历史领域则表现为一种大民族文化意识。换句话说，现代意识对历史人物的观照，是创造一个与传统戏曲中不同的、符合现代人价值观念和审美评价的全新的萧太后形象的前提。由于这一形象符合唯物史观和现代美学原则，所以她才能为各民族观众所接受，并产生其审美效应。
