A survey of 35 physical education teachers from 26 primary and secondary schools in our city revealed that the primary issues facing the team of physical education teachers are as follows:

There is a lack of successors among physical education teachers. Over the years, these 26 schools have not received any graduates specializing in physical education. Some schools, to meet the needs of physical education teaching, have had to temporarily assign other teachers to teach physical education. Some teachers are not suited for physical education teaching but still fill in. Among the surveyed physical education teachers, 40% are in poor physical condition. A 55-year-old female teacher shared her feelings: "As I get older, my hands and feet are not as agile for teaching physical education. I hope the relevant departments will strengthen the team of physical education teachers."

Physical education teachers are not committed to their jobs. Currently, while there is a shortage of physical education teachers, many are not committed to their jobs. This is mainly due to the low social status of physical education teachers. Most parents are eager for their children to succeed and focus only on their academic studies, not wanting their children to join sports teams for fear of jeopardizing their future. In terms of compensation, some schools allow science and mathematics teachers to give private lessons and earn three to four yuan per class, but physical education teachers training sports teams are not considered to be giving private lessons and receive no additional pay. Even if the sports committee assigns teachers with regular training tasks, they only receive 0.30 yuan per training session.

Physical education teachers work very hard. In terms of the work environment, physical education classes are generally held outdoors, exposing teachers to wind and sun. In terms of teaching methods, physical education classes involve less talking and more doing, with a high volume of physical activity, especially when training sports teams. Teachers train in the cold of winter and the heat of summer, making their work extremely demanding. In terms of work hours, physical education teachers work 10 to 11 hours a day.

Primary and secondary school physical education teachers are the "shapers" of children's physical fitness and the "pioneers" of athletes. Currently, as the world's competitive sports level continues to rise, China must strengthen its team of primary and secondary school physical education teachers to become a leading nation in sports.

### 加强中小学体育教师队伍

　　加强中小学体育教师队伍
    据对我市２６所中小学的３５名体育教师调查发现，目前中小学体育教师队伍存在的主要问题是：
    体育教师后继乏人。这２６所中小学，多年来没有分到过体育专业的毕业生。有的学校为解决体育教学的需要，只得临时让其他教师担任体育教员。一些教师不适应体育教学，但仍凑数。被调查的体育教师中，有４０％的身体状况不佳。一位５５岁的女教师深有感触地说：“年龄大了，教体育手脚太笨，希望有关部门充实体育教师队伍。”
    体育教师不安心本职工作。现在，一方面体育教师后继乏人，一方面不少体育教师不安心本职工作。这主要是体育教师的社会地位低。多数家长“望子成龙”心切，只注重子女的文化课学习，不愿意让子女参加运动队训练，怕误了“前程”。在待遇上，有的学校数理化教师给学生补课，每节课领取三四元讲课费，可体育教师训练运动队不被视为补课，无补助。即使体委安排有常年训练任务的教师，每次训练费也仅有０．３０元。
    体育教师的工作辛苦。从工作环境看，体育课一般在室外教学，教师多受风吹日晒。从授课方式看，体育课“讲”得少，“做”得多，运动量大，尤其是训练运动队，冬练三九，夏练三伏，体育老师十分辛苦。从工作时间看，体育教师每天工作１０至１１个小时。
    中小学体育教师是少年儿童体质的“铸造师”，运动员的“启蒙者”。当前，在世界体育竞技水平不断提高的情况下，我国要跻于世界体育之强的行列，加强中小学体育师资队伍建设是必不可少的。
