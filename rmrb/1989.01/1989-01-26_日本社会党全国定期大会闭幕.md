The three-day-long 54th National Regular Convention of the Japanese Socialist Party concluded on January 25 in Tokyo. The convention unanimously adopted the 1989 movement guidelines and election struggle guidelines, with the primary focus on strengthening the party's power.

The convention also passed seven resolutions and a convention declaration, including the abolition of the consumption tax, the investigation of the Recruit stock bribery case, and the achievement of victory in the spring struggle. The convention declaration demanded the resignation of the entire Takeshita cabinet and the dissolution of the Diet.

This convention reiterated the Socialist Party's fundamental stance on the war responsibility of Emperor Showa, stating that "at that time, the military used the emperor's authority and prestige to drive the Japanese people into war."
