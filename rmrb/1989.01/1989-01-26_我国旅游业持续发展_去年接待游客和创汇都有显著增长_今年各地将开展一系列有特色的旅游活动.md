    China's tourism industry continues to develop
    Last year, the number of tourists received and foreign exchange earnings both saw significant increases
    This year, various places will hold a series of distinctive tourism activities

    Xinhua News Agency reports: Reporter Liu Xiao reports: State Tourism Administration Director Liu Yi said on January 25 at a press conference that in 1988, China's tourism industry continued to develop. The total number of inbound tourists was 31.27 million, an increase of about 17% over the previous year; the number of organized tourists received was 4.3 million, an increase of 13.6%. Among them, foreign tourists numbered 1.84 million, an increase of 6.6%, and tourism foreign exchange earnings were $2.22 billion, an increase of 19.4%.

    Last year, among the tourists who came to China, Japanese and American tourists still accounted for the first and second positions among foreign tourists. A change in the overseas tourism market is that 400,000 Taiwanese compatriots came to visit relatives, surpassing the number of Hong Kong and Macau tourists for the first time. According to a survey, Taiwanese compatriots' average consumption in mainland China is $2,000, the highest among all tourists.

    Liu Yi said that due to the impact of domestic price fluctuations, China's outbound tourism charges will be increased by 10% in 1989. Due to the mismatch between tourism transportation capacity and market demand, the situation of "can't come in, can't go out" has caused dissatisfaction among foreign tourists. Currently, the quality of catering services is also not guaranteed, and these problems must be given high attention.

    1989 is the 40th anniversary of the founding of the People's Republic of China. The State Tourism Administration and local tourism departments plan to hold a series of promotional and marketing activities. Large-scale tourism promotional exhibitions will be held in the spring and autumn, and nearly 20 exhibition and sales events will be participated in the main tourism source countries. This year marks the 2540th anniversary of Confucius' birth. Shandong, Beijing, and other places will hold "Confucius Culture Festival" tourism activities, open up ancient cultural tourism routes from Confucius' hometown to other famous historical and cultural cities, and launch special tourism activities such as studying in Confucius' hometown. The tourism route of the last emperor, organized by Beijing, has also been arranged.

    It was also learned from the press conference that the organizational adjustment of the State Tourism Administration, focusing on strengthening macro-management and facing the international market, has been basically completed. The new organization will start operating on February 1. In the process of streamlining the organization, the organizational setup and staffing of the State Tourism Administration have not only not been reduced but have increased, indicating the importance China attaches to the tourism industry.

　　我国旅游业持续发展     
    去年接待游客和创汇都有显著增长
    今年各地将开展一系列有特色的旅游活动
    本报讯  记者刘霄报道：国家旅游局局长刘毅１月２５日在新闻发布会上指出，１９８８年我国旅游业持续发展，入境总人数３１２７万，比上年增长１７％左右；有组织接待的旅游者４３０万，比上年增长１３．６％。其中外国游客１８４万，增长６．６％，旅游创汇２２．２亿美元，比上年增长１９．４％。
    去年，来中国的旅游者中，日、美游客仍占国外游客的第一、二位。海外旅游客源市场的一个变化是，前来探亲旅游的台湾同胞达４０万之多，首次超过港澳游客人数。据调查，台胞在大陆人均消费２０００美元，为所有旅游者之冠。
    刘毅说，受国内物价波动影响，１９８９年我国对外旅游收费将提高１０％。由于旅游交通能力和市场需求不相适应，“进不来，出不去”的情况引起国外游客的不满，目前餐饮质量也没有保证，这些问题必须予以高度的重视。
    １９８９年是我国建国４０周年，国家旅游局和各地旅游部门计划举行一系列的宣传促销活动。春秋两季将举办大规模的旅游宣传展览活动，同时将参加主要旅游客源国的近２０次展销会。今年是孔子诞辰２５４０周年，山东、北京等地将举办“孔子文化节”旅游活动，开辟孔子家乡去其它著名历史文化名城的“古文化旅游路线”，推出孔子家乡修学等专项旅游活动等。北京市牵头组织的末代皇帝旅游路线也已作了安排。
    记者从新闻发布会上还获悉，国家旅游局以加强宏观管理、面向国际市场为重点进行的机构调整已基本完成，新机构将于２月１日投入运转。在精简机构中，国家旅游局的机构设置和人员编制不但没有减少反而有所增加，说明我国对旅游业的重视程度。
