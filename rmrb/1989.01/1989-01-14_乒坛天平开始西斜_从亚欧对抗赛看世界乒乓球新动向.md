The Balance in Table Tennis Begins to Tilt Westward
— Observations from the Asia-Europe Ping Pong Rivalry

The team competition of the Asia-Europe Ping Pong Rivalry concluded with a narrow victory for the Asian team. This match was more about the top players testing each other and warming up, with their focus on the 40th World Table Tennis Championships just two months away. What new trends in table tennis did people observe from the recent matches? The reporter conducted telephone interviews with experts such as Xu Shaofa and Zhang Xianlin and obtained the following impressions.

European male players are on the verge of a qualitative leap

In this Asia-Europe Rivalry, the European men's team, consisting of Waldner, Appelgren, and Gruba, won all three matches, sweeping the competition. Judging from their performance, their technical condition has not yet reached its peak. If they all played at their best, the outcome would be even more impressive.

Several years ago, European male players already had considerable strength. Whether due to bad luck or other reasons, they often performed well in general international competitions, accumulating victories, but when it came to the World Championships or Olympic Games, the gold medals mostly went to Asian athletes. Failure after failure, they kept coming back. Led by several Swedish stars, a group of European male players have matured after years of training. They possess the strength to win in terms of technique, experience, and momentum. In the upcoming Dortmund World Table Tennis Championships, European male players are likely to win the men's team or singles gold medal.

In contrast, the Asian men's team had an incomplete lineup this time. Olympic champion, South Korea's Liu Nan-kui, who was supposed to participate, was absent due to sudden stomach pain before boarding the plane. Additionally, high-level players from North Korea, Kim Sung-hui and Lee Geon-seong, were also absent for unspecified reasons. Jiang Jialiang and others performed averagely in the competition. Besides the objective factors of humid and hot climate, their techniques and tactics were rough, indicating insufficient systematic training and targeted preparation. Teng Yi performed slightly better, but his strength was not superior. Worth mentioning in the Asian team is South Korea's 19-year-old rising star Kim Jae-seok. He uses a right-handed penholder with inverted rubber, employing a loop drive attack style. His forehand can both loop and smash, with significant destructive power, and has already become a key player for South Korea. Experts describe him as a "future star" who cannot be overlooked.

European female players are on a rapid rise

Zhang Xianlin describes the current playing style of several main players in the European women's team as "brutal," meaning that the term "aggressive" is far from sufficient. Hungarian players like Bartfi, West German players like Nemes, and Bulgarian players like Gergelcheva are several rising stars who appear very energetic on the court. Their men's-style loop drive style is aggressive from the start, attacking and looping fiercely, like an offensive boxer aiming to knock out the opponent in one punch, pressing the opponent tightly.

In addition to the characteristics of fierce attacks and powerful strikes, another new change in European female players is significant progress in their serve and receive techniques. Previously, they did not pay much attention to this aspect and suffered losses. In this competition, Asian players found it difficult to gain an advantage in serving. Experts see the rapid progress of European female players as a sign that the world of women's table tennis is also entering a new era of Euro-Asian competition.

### 乒坛天平开始西斜——从亚欧对抗赛看世界乒乓球新动向

　　乒坛天平开始西斜
    ——从亚欧对抗赛看世界乒乓球新动向
    亚欧乒乓球对抗赛的团体角逐以亚洲队小胜而告结束。此次比赛乒坛高手们重在相互摸底和热身，目光都放在两个多月后的第４０届世界乒乓球锦标赛上。从前几天的比赛中人们看到了哪些乒坛新动向呢？记者通过电话采访许绍发和张燮林等行家，得到以下一些印象。
    　　　　欧洲男选手即将跨出量变到质变的一步
    这次亚欧对抗赛，由瓦尔德内尔、阿佩伊伦、格鲁巴组成的欧洲男一队，三战三捷，所向披靡，从场上表现看，他们的技术状态尚未达到巅峰，如果他们都打“疯”了，那还了得？
    早在几年前就颇具实力的欧洲男选手，不知是运气不佳还是别的原因，总是在一般性国际比赛中成绩优良，战果累累，而一旦到世界锦标赛或奥运会上，金牌却大多落入亚洲运动员手中。一次次失败，一次次卷土重来。以瑞典几员大将为代表的一批欧洲男选手经过数年磨练，走向成熟。他们无论从技术、经验到气势，都具备夺冠实力。在即将来临的多特蒙德世乒赛上，欧洲男选手很可能夺取男子团体或单打金牌。
    相比之下，亚洲男队这次阵容不齐。奥运会冠军、南朝鲜的刘南奎原来说来，临比赛时又缺席，据说是上飞机前突然肚子疼。另外，水平很高的朝鲜选手金成熙、李根相也因故缺席。江嘉良等比赛中发挥一般，除了气候潮湿炎热的客观因素外，本身技术战术均显粗糙，看得出系统训练和针对性准备不够。滕毅表现稍好，但实力不占上风。亚洲队中值得一提的是南朝鲜１９岁的新秀金泽洙。他右手直拍反胶，弧圈快攻打法，正手能拉能扣，杀伤力大，已经成为南朝鲜主力。他被行家称为不可忽视的“未来之星”。
    　　　　欧洲女将上升势头咄咄逼人
    张燮林把欧洲女队几员主将现在的打法形容为“暴力型”，即用进攻凶猛的字眼都远远不够了。匈牙利的巴托菲、西德的内梅斯、保加利亚的格尔格尔切娃等几名后起之秀在场上显得非常有朝气。她们男子式的弧圈打法一上手就猛冲猛拉，好像进攻型的拳击手一下就想把人打倒似的，紧紧压住对手。
    除了抢攻凶、发力狠的特点外，欧洲女将另一个新变化是，发球和接发球技术有不小的长进。以前她们不重视这方面，吃了亏。这次比赛，亚洲选手在发球上很难占到便宜。行家们从欧洲女将咄咄逼人的进步势头中感到，世界乒坛女子方面也将进入欧亚抗衡的新时期。
