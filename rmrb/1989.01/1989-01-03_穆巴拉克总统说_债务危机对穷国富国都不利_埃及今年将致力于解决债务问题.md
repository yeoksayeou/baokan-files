President Mubarak says debt crisis harms both poor and rich countries

Egypt will focus on resolving debt issues in 1989

Xinhua News Agency, Cairo, December 30, 1988

Egypt's _Al-Ahram_ newspaper reported today that Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak, in an interview with the newspaper's reporter, said that he will focus on resolving the debt issue in 1989.

Mubarak said that the debt crisis has severely affected poor countries, and their development plans have been hindered due to the increasing debt burden.

He pointed out that in the past three years, the debt of developing countries has increased from $900 billion to $1,100 billion.

According to reports, Egypt's debt has reached $40 billion.

Mubarak said, "Rich countries are also affected by the debt crisis. The heavy debt burden on third-world countries means they cannot afford to import machinery and equipment from rich countries. If this situation continues, it will eventually have adverse effects on the economies of rich countries."

Mubarak also criticized rich countries for refusing to increase aid to third-world countries.

Mubarak told the _Al-Ahram_ reporter that in the new year, he plans to visit Japan, India, China, the United States, and France to discuss debt and domestic development issues with the leaders of these countries.

　　穆巴拉克总统说
    债务危机对穷国富国都不利
    埃及今年将致力于解决债务问题
    新华社开罗１９８８年１２月３０日电  埃及《金字塔报》今天报道，埃及总统穆巴拉克在接受该报记者采访时说，１９８９年他将致力于解决债务问题。
    穆巴拉克说，债务危机使穷国身受其害，由于债务累进增多，他们的发展计划受到了挫折。
    他指出，三年来发展中国家的债务已从９０００亿美元增长到了１１０００亿美元。
    据报道，埃及的债务已达４００亿美元。
    穆巴拉克说：“富国也受到了债务危机的影响。第三世界国家债务沉重，他们没有能力再从富国进口机器设备。这种情况延续下去终将会对富国的经济产生副作用。”
    穆巴拉克还批评富国拒绝向第三世界国家增加援助。
    穆巴拉克对《金字塔报》记者说，在新的一年里，他想访问日本、印度、中国、美国和法国，同这些国家的领导人讨论债务和国内发展问题。
