Recently, the People's Procuratorate of Lianyuan City, Hunan Province, decided that the Public Security Bureau of the city should, in accordance with the law, arrest Tan Shunqing, an 81-year-old villager from Jin Di Village, Mao Ping Township, and his 73-year-old wife, Qiu Youxiu, for the crime of illegally entering others' homes.

From 1977 to 1986, Tan Shunqing and Qiu Youxiu's son, Tan Shoukun, successively held positions such as procurement officer, accountant, cashier, and party branch secretary in the tea factory, enterprise office, and construction company of Mao Ping Township. During the financial audit in 1986, it was discovered that he had suspicions of misappropriating and delaying public funds. The deputy secretary of the township party committee, Li Mengde, asked him to continue working while writing a confession. Tan Shoukun, burdened by heavy thoughts, wrote a suicide note on November 19, 1986, and drowned himself. After the incident, the township government handled the funeral arrangements and comforted his relatives.

Over the years, Tan Shunqing and Qiu Youxiu, claiming that their son was driven to death, frequently caused disturbances in the township government office. They stayed in the homes of the township's main leaders and other cadres for extended periods, often crying, making a fuss, and arguing, which seriously disrupted the normal work order of the township government. Last February, the municipal committee, together with the district and township, once again persuaded them and signed an agreement with Tan Shoukun's wife to provide 500 yuan in living allowance and arrange for one of their children to work in a township-owned enterprise. Only then did Tan Shunqing and his wife return home from the township government.

Four months later, Tan Shunqing and his wife, claiming that their son was killed by Li Mengde and that they had no one to rely on for life, on the morning of May 30, 1988, broke into Li Mengde's private residence, forcing Li Mengde's entire family to move into the municipal committee's guesthouse. Afterwards, the municipal, district, and township repeatedly sent people to persuade and educate them to leave Li Mengde's home. Tan Shunqing and Qiu Youxiu thought that because of their age, the government could do nothing to them, and used their old age as a threat, illegally staying in others' homes for a long time without leaving. The law is fair. Although Tan Shunqing and Qiu Youxiu are of advanced age, they disregarded national laws, resulting in their high-age arrest according to the law, truly reaping what they sowed.

　　无理取闹非法侵入他人住宅  自食其果谭顺清夫妇被逮捕
    日前，湖南省涟源市人民检察院作出决定，由市公安局依法将居住在毛坪乡锦地村的８１岁村民谭顺清和７３岁的邱有秀夫妇以非法侵入他人住宅罪逋捕。
    谭顺清、邱有秀夫妇之子谭寿昆，自１９７７年至１９８６年，先后在毛坪乡茶厂、企业办、建筑公司担任采购员、会计、出纳、党支部书记等职。在１９８６年清理财务时，发现他有挪用、拖欠公款等嫌疑，乡党委副书记李孟德要他边工作边写交代材料。谭寿昆因思想包袱太重，竟于１９８６年１１月１９日写了遗书，投河自杀。事发后，乡政府办理了安葬事宜，并对其亲属进行了安慰。
    几年来，谭顺清、邱有秀以其儿是被逼死为由，多次在乡政府机关闹事，较长时间住在乡政府主要负责人及其他干部家中，经常哭、闹、吵，严重影响了乡政府机关的正常工作秩序。去年２月，市委协同区、乡再次对其做说服工作，并与谭寿昆妻子签订了解决５００元生活补助费、安排一名子女到乡办企业工作的协议，谭顺清夫妇才由乡政府回家。
    事过４个月之后，谭顺清夫妇又以其子是李孟德害死，生活无依靠为由，于１９８８年５月３０日上午，闯入李孟德私人住宅，迫使李孟德全家搬进市委机关招待所。此后，市区乡又多次派人动员教育其离开李孟德家。谭顺清、邱有秀认为自己年龄大，政府奈何不得，以老相要挟，长期非法侵入他人住宅不走。法律是公正的。谭顺清、邱有秀虽年高寿大，但无视国家法律，以致高龄被依法逮捕，真是自食恶果。
