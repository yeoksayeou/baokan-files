	U.S. President-Elect Bush Completes Cabinet Formation
	Presidential Inauguration Ceremony Imminent, Expected to Cost $25 Million

	According to Xinhua News Agency, Washington, January 12 — U.S. President-elect Bush today nominated retired Navy Admiral James Watkins to serve as Secretary of Energy, thereby completing the formation of his incoming administration.

	Watkins, 61, previously served as the U.S. Chief of Naval Operations and Commander of the Pacific Fleet.

	Bush also nominated former Secretary of Education Bennett to serve as the newly established Director of National Drug Control Policy, a position equivalent to a cabinet-level secretary.

	Our Washington correspondent, Cang Lide, reports: To celebrate the inauguration of the 41st U.S. President Bush on January 20, starting from the 18th, the capital Washington will host the most expensive presidential inauguration ceremony in U.S. history. The four-day event is expected to cost $25 million.

	This year marks the 200th anniversary of the inauguration of the first U.S. President, George Washington, in New York in 1789. To commemorate this, the U.S. established the "U.S. Presidential Inauguration 200th Anniversary" organization to prepare various commemorative activities. President-elect Bush named this ceremony "Peace, Prosperity, and Independence," a theme identical to the second U.S. President's inauguration ceremony in 1797.

	This year's celebration will be held at the White House, Congress, the Lincoln Memorial, the Kennedy Center for the Performing Arts, train stations, several large hotels, and museums. Thousands of Americans are expected to flock from all over the country to participate in parades, performances, balls, banquets, and other activities. Many young people will hold "From George (Washington) to George (Bush)" celebration ceremonies. President-elect Bush and Vice President-elect Quayle will participate in some of the activities and will officially take the oath of office at noon on the 20th at Congress.

	To raise funds, the Presidential Inauguration Committee has received $20 million in donations from 200 companies and individuals in just two weeks, with each donation amounting to $100,000. Part of the funds will be repaid from the income of banquet tickets ($1,500 each) and the sale of commemorative items. Additionally, the U.S. Congress has allocated a special fund of $5 million for this purpose.

　　美当选总统布什完成组阁
    总统就职庆典在即　预计耗资２５００万美元
    据新华社华盛顿１月１２日电  美国当选总统布什今天提名退伍海军上将詹姆斯·沃特金斯出任能源部长，由此完成了下届政府的组阁工作。
    沃特金斯现年６１岁，曾任美国海军作战部长和太平洋舰队司令。
    布什今天还提名前教育部长贝内特出任新增设的、相当于内阁部长级别的缉毒总监。
    本报华盛顿１月１３日电　记者仓立德报道：为庆祝美国第４１任总统布什本月２０日宣誓就职，从１８日起，首都华盛顿将举行美国历史上耗资空前的总统就职庆典。预计历时４天的活动费用将达２５００万美元。
    今年恰逢美国首任总统乔治·华盛顿１７８９年在纽约宣誓就职２００周年，为此美国成立了“美国总统就职２００周年”专门机构，筹备各项纪念活动。当选总统布什将此次庆典命名为“和平、繁荣和独立”，这一主题与１７９７年美国第２任总统就职典礼相同。
    今年的庆祝仪式将在白宫、国会、林肯纪念堂、肯尼迪艺术中心、火车站、一些大旅馆和博物馆等地举行，届时将有成千上万美国人从各地涌来，参加游行、表演、舞会、宴会等活动，许多青少年将举行“从乔治（华盛顿）到乔治（布什）”的庆祝仪式。当选总统布什和副总统奎尔将参加部分活动，并于２０日中午１２时在国会正式宣誓就职。
    为筹措经费，总统就职委员会已在两星期内从２００个企业和私人那里接受２０００万美元捐款，每份为１０万美元。部分款项将从宴会入场券（每张１５００美元）及出售纪念品等收入中偿还。另外，美国国会已为此拨专款５００万美元。
