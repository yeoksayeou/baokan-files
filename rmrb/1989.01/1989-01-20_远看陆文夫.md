Title: Observing Lu Wenfu from Afar

I have had several opportunities to meet him, but almost every time it was a fleeting encounter. Most of the time, he was on stage while I was in the audience. In my memory, he always preferred to sit on the side during meetings, never in the center. Only when he had to speak would he move slightly towards the middle. Whenever he spoke, his words were concise yet captivating, often leaving the listeners wanting more and pondering over his words.

In the early spring of the previous year, I was at the Lu Xun Literary Institute in Beijing for further studies. Lu Wenfu came to Beijing to attend the National People's Congress. One evening, the institute invited him to give a lecture. I thought he would surely encourage us, his devoted students. However, as soon as he took the stage, he "doused us with cold water," advising us not to rush and to read more books. He said, "Life is like walking on a beach. No one can leave an eternal footprint. The tides of the sea will wash away one batch of footprints after another. Otherwise, the beach would be filled with countless, deep and shallow footprints, and what would be the point of the beach?"

It was also the previous year, during the autumn, that I went to Yancheng to attend the "Crane Literary Festival." Writers from all over the country came. Lu Wenfu was also there. The reception in Yancheng was unprecedentedly grand. However, after several days of visits and tours, Lu Wenfu was nowhere to be seen. When I asked others, I learned that Yancheng was where Lu Wenfu had once suffered hardship and settled. This barren yet vast land gave him the courage to start life anew; the people here warmed his weary heart with strong liquor and simple meals. He couldn't keep up with the "main group" and hurried off to visit his long-lost friends.

In May of last year, the second "Ceramic City Literary Festival" was held in Yixing. Several leaders and famous writers from Beijing came. Lu Wenfu was also there. I encountered him several times and noticed that his smile was fading. I heard that there was a bit of unpleasantness during the event. On the way back, I rode in Lu Wenfu's car, and he remained sullen and silent. He neither hides himself nor wants to hide himself; he neither manipulates others nor wants to be manipulated by others. Perhaps this is another of Lu Wenfu's characteristics.

At the tea gathering for the inaugural issue of "Suzhou Magazine," I saw Lu Wenfu again. This time, he was different from before, a bit excited and quite witty. He told everyone that "Suzhou Magazine" had finally been published after much anticipation, but who knows when it might disappear. Things in the world always have their ups and downs, beginnings and ends. He said, "In the past, Wu Yu could beg for alms to study, so we can also humbly ask entrepreneurs and people from all walks of life for support to do something good for the people of Suzhou." He had put a lot of effort into publishing this magazine.

Lu Wenfu, as the vice-chairman of the Chinese Writers Association and a member of the National People's Congress, rarely gives speeches or engages in grand activities in Suzhou. More often, he appears as a silent, ordinary citizen. He lives frugally. Although he once wrote the famous "The Gourmet," many friends who visit often see his dining table with a bowl of green vegetables, a bowl of spicy pickled radishes, and a pot of soup. In the spring of 1985, just after the Spring Festival, Lu Wenfu hid in the countryside of Changshu to write "The Well." In the more than a month it took to create characters like Xu Lisha and Zhu Shiyi, he almost always had instant noodles and a can of rose-flavored preserved bean paste with his porridge at the guesthouse. He spent his 58th birthday alone in a county-run guesthouse in Qinnan, also eating instant noodles.

In recent years, Lu Wenfu has almost always traveled abroad each year. Every time he returns, letters asking him to write articles pour in. But I rarely read his articles about his overseas experiences. It's not that he has no impressions or feelings, but he doesn't want to hastily write about superficial observations. He is stern, serious, extremely diligent, and extremely sincere. He rarely writes, and he strives to make every work he presents lovable to people. I have never visited his home and have never had a long conversation with him. He is so busy, and I don't want to disturb him just to write this piece. I can only, like everyone who respects him, observe and admire this thin writer from afar.

### 远看陆文夫

　　远看陆文夫
    吕锦华
    和他见面的机会虽不少，但几乎每次都匆匆而过。更多的时候是他在台上我在台下。印象中他每次开会总喜欢偏旁，不愿居中；迫不得已发言时才稍稍移向中间。每次说话，语言简短而精彩，常使听者欲罢不休，回味无穷。
    前年初春，我在北京鲁迅文学院进修。陆文夫来北京参加人大会议，某日晚上学院请他来讲课。我想，他一定会对我们这些虔诚的学生大大鼓励一番。然而，一登台他就给我们“泼冷水”，劝我们不要着急，要多读一点书。他说，人生就像在海滩上走路，谁都不能留下永恒的脚印。大海的潮水会把一批又一批的脚印抹去。要不，海滩边印满了密密麻麻、深深浅浅的脚印，这海滩还有啥看头？
    也是前年，金秋时节我去盐城参加“丹顶鹤散文节”。全国各地来了许多著名作家。陆文夫也来了。盐城的接待是空前隆重的。但连续几天的参观访问，总不见陆文夫的身影。问其他同志，才知盐城是陆文夫受难时落户的地方。这块贫瘠而广阔的土地给了他重新生活的勇气；这里的人民用烈性的白酒和粗茶淡饭温暖着他疲惫的心；他随不得“大部队”行动而匆匆去看望久别的乡亲了。
    去年５月，宜兴举办第二届陶都散文节。北京来了几位作协领导和著名作家。陆文夫也来了。我几次相遇看到他脸上的笑容越来越少。听说活动中夹杂了一点不愉快的插曲。归途中我搭陆文夫的车，他仍闷闷地一言不发。不会掩饰自己也不愿掩饰自己，不会摆布别人也不愿受人摆布；这，也许又是陆文夫的一点特色吧。
    《苏州杂志》创刊号的茶话会上，我又见到了陆文夫。这时的他跟前几次不同，有点兴奋，又那么诙谐。他告诉大家，《苏州杂志》“千呼万唤”终于出来了，但说不定哪天又没有了，世间的事情嘛，总是有兴有衰、有启有闭的。他说，当年武训尚能行乞修学，因此我们也只好不怕难为情向企业家和各界人士“化缘”，为苏州人民做点好事。为办这份刊物他是颇费了一番心机的。
    陆文夫身为中国作协副主席和全国人大代表，但他在苏州很少有兴师动众的讲话或活动。更多的时候，他是以一个默默的、普通的公民出现。他生活俭朴，虽然他曾经写出了脍炙人口的《美食家》，然而，许多好友登门拜访，常常见他家的饭桌上摆着一碗青菜、一碗酸辣萝卜和一砂锅汤。１９８５年春节刚过，陆文夫躲到常熟乡下去写《井》。在把徐丽莎、朱世一等人物脱胎出来的一个多月时间里，他在招待所几乎天天是方便面，外加一罐子配合吃粥的玫瑰腐乳度过的。５８岁的生日也是单身一人在琴南乡的一家乡办招待所度过，吃的也是方便面。
    近年来，陆文夫几乎每年都要出国访问。每次回来约他撰写文章的信函纷至沓来。但我很少读到他关于国外见闻的文章。不是没有印象和感受，而是不愿把浮光掠影的东西仓促成文。他是冷峻的，严肃的，极认真，极真诚的。他轻易不下笔，他力求奉献的每一部作品都为人们所喜爱。我至今没有拜访过他的家，也没听他长谈过。他是那么忙，我不愿为写这篇小文而去打扰他。我只是像所有敬重他的人一样，远远地关注着、打量着这位瘦瘦的作家。
