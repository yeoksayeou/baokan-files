	When one side of a car's wheels gets stuck in mud, it often spins out of control and cannot escape. Engineering vehicles such as loaders, scrapers, and wheeled bulldozers, as well as off-road vehicles, dump trucks, and heavy-duty trucks, frequently encounter similar issues when driving on rough terrain. A variable ratio differential gear developed by Wang Xiaochun, Wu Xutang, and Peng Wei from the Mechanical Engineering Department of Xi'an Jiaotong University offers a good solution to this problem and has been highly praised by domestic and international experts. This variable ratio differential gear improves the locking coefficient of similar advanced differential gears from abroad from 1.5 to 3.

	The ordinary differential gear is a mechanical device on the car's drive axle that allows the drive wheels to rotate at different speeds when turning. However, it cannot help a wheel stuck in mud to escape. A high-friction differential gear, due to its complex structure and rapid wear, cannot solve the problem either. The locking coefficient of the more advanced variable ratio differential gears from abroad only reaches 1.5, which does not meet the needs of driving on rough terrain. Wang Xiaochun and his team have improved the locking capability of the variable ratio differential gear through theoretical analysis and ingenious design, enhancing its ability to prevent wheel spin. When one wheel starts to spin, this differential gear automatically increases the torque on the other wheel. Compared to similar differential gears from abroad, it can increase the driving force by 60%, helping the vehicle to escape from the mud.

　　汽车泥中轮打滑　今有新招可救驾
    西安交大制成变传动比差速器
    本报讯  汽车一侧车轮陷入泥泞中，便会加速空转打滑不能自拔。在恶劣路面行驶和在工地作业的装载机、铲运机、轮式推土机等工程机械，越野汽车、自卸汽车和重型载重汽车也常发生类似情况。西安交通大学机械系王小椿、吴序堂、彭炜研制成功的变传动比差速器，为解决此类问题找到了一种好方法，受到国内外专家高度评价。这种变传动比差速器把国外同类较先进差速器的锁紧系数从１．５提高到３。
    普通差速器是汽车驱动桥上的机械装置，它的作用是使车辆两侧的驱动轮转弯时能以不同的速度转动，但它不能使一侧打滑的车轮从泥泞中挣扎出来。有一种高摩擦式差速器由于结构复杂，且磨损快、寿命短，不能解决问题。国外较先进的变传动比差速器的锁紧系数只能达到１．５，满足不了在恶劣路面行驶的需要。王小椿等研制的变传动比差速器在保留国外同类差速器优点的前提下，通过理论分析和巧妙构思重新设计变传动比差速器的齿形，使它的锁紧能力有很大提高，增强了防止车轮空转打滑的作用。当一侧车轮出现打滑趋向时，这种差速器就能自动增加另一侧车轮的扭矩，与国外同类差速器相比，可增加６０％的驱动力，使车辆冲出泥泞。　　（聂云章　李明德）
