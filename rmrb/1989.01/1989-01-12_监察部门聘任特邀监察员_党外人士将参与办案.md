Monitoring Departments to Appoint Special Invitation Inspectors; Non-Party Members to Participate in Case Handling

    According to Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, January 11th, (reporter Zhou Changxin) Monitoring Department Director Wei Jianxing said today at a symposium held by the Monitoring Department with some non-party members that the monitoring departments will appoint a group of non-party members to serve as special invitation inspectors for various levels of monitoring agencies, participating in administrative supervision work.

    Recently, CPC Central Committee General Secretary Zhao Ziyang clearly stated at a symposium with non-party members that he hopes non-party members will actively participate in the work of rectifying the economic environment and regulating economic order. It is understood that more than 30 members from various democratic parties and non-party members have participated in the national financial and tax inspection, the national investigation of the situation of reducing the scale of construction projects, and the investigation by the Monitoring Department.

    The non-party members who participated in today's symposium said that through participating in the investigations and case handling organized by the Monitoring Department, they have the opportunity to learn about some things they previously had no chance to know, which not only contributes to the government but also allows them to gain experience and improvement.

    Song Kun, Vice Minister of the United Front Work Department of the CPC Central Committee, spoke at the symposium, believing that inviting non-party members to directly participate in the work of rectification and regulation is a new form of embodying multi-party cooperation and the participation of democratic party members in political consultation, which needs to be continuously enriched and improved in practice.

    Director Wei Jianxing said at the symposium that absorbing non-party members, members of mass organizations, and experts and scholars from various fields to participate in the investigations and case handling of administrative supervision departments should be institutionalized and become a regular task, combining top-down administrative supervision with bottom-up public supervision.

　　监察部门聘任特邀监察员  党外人士将参与办案
    据新华社北京１月１１日电  （记者周长新）监察部部长尉健行今天在监察部召开的部分党外人士座谈会上说，监察部门将聘请一批党外人士担任各级监察机关的特邀监察员，参与行政监察工作。
    中共中央总书记赵紫阳不久前在党外人士座谈会上明确表示，希望党外人士积极参与治理经济环境、整顿经济秩序的工作。据了解，已有３０多位各民主党派、无党派人士分别参加了全国财务税收大检查、全国压缩基建规模情况调查和监察部的调查。
    参加今天座谈会的党外人士表示，通过参与监察部组织的调查和办案，有机会了解到一些以前没有机会了解的事情，既为政府出了力，也使自己得到了锻炼和提高。
    中共中央统战部副部长宋堃在座谈会上发言认为，请党外人士直接参与治理、整顿工作，是体现多党合作和民主党派成员参政议政的一种新形式，要在实践中不断充实完善。
    尉健行部长在座谈会上说，吸收党外人士、群众团体成员和各方面专家学者参加行政监察部门的调查和办案，要作为制度固定下来，变成经常性的工作，把自上而下的行政监察和自下而上的群众监督结合起来。
