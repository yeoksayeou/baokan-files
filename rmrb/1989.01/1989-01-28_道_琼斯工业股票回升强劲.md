The Dow Jones Industrial Average closed at 2,291.07 points on the 26th.

On the 26th, this index rose by 25.18 points. The strong rebound in the Dow Jones stock index was due to two main factors: the U.S. Congress decided not to take measures to restrict mergers and acquisitions, and the increase in durable goods orders in December last year boosted investor confidence. Another factor was the bullish outlook for U.S. bonds.

Some financial experts in New York believe that the Dow Jones Industrial Average may break through the 2,300-point mark in the near future.

　　道·琼斯工业股票回升强劲
    道·琼斯三十种工业股票平均指数二十六日收盘时上升到二千二百九十一点○七点。
    二十六日，这项指数上升了二十五点一八点。道·琼斯股票指数回升强劲，一则因美国会决定不采取措施限制兼并活动，一则因去年十二月份美国耐用品订货上升，使投资者受到鼓舞。另一个因素是美国债券看涨。
    纽约一些金融界人士认为，道·琼斯三十种工业股票平均指数近期内有可能突破二千三百点。
