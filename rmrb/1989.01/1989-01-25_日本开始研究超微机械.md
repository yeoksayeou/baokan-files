Japan has begun research on ultra-micromachines capable of navigating through blood vessels.

	New China News Agency, Tokyo, January 23rd - (Reporter Yao Li) Japan has initiated research on ultra-micromachines, including robots that can travel within blood vessels. These ultra-micromachines, measured in micrometers (one-thousandth of a millimeter), will utilize technologies such as very large-scale integrated circuits and semiconductors, with silicon as the primary material. The goal is to create micro-robots that can move within blood vessels and the heart, enabling direct diagnosis and treatment.

	According to Kyodo News, the United States has already commenced research on ultra-micromachines and has produced gears with a radius of 200 micrometers and a thickness of several micrometers. Japan recently established the Micromachine Research Association, bringing together experts from academia and industry specializing in semiconductors and precision machinery. The association is focused on development, research, and information gathering.

	The successful development of ultra-micromachines will revolutionize the field of medicine and have wide-ranging applications in other areas.

　　日本开始研究超微机械
    新华社东京１月２３日电（记者姚力）日本开始研究能在血管中行走的机器人等超微小机械。
    超微小机械是指以微米（１‰毫米）为单位的机械装置，将使用超大规模集成电路等半导体制造技术，以硅为材料，制成可在血管和心脏中行走，直接诊断、治疗的超微小机器人。据共同社报道，美国已经开始了超微小机械的研究，并试制成半径２００微米、厚数微米的齿轮。日本最近成立了微型机械研究会，集中了日本学界、产业界的半导体、精密机械等研究人员，从事开发研究、情报收集等。
    超微小机械的研制成功将在医学领域引起革命性进步，在其他方面的应用也极为广泛。
