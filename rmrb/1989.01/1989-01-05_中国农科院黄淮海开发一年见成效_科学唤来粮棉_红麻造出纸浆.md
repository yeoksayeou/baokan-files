The China Agricultural University's development efforts in the Yellow-Huai-Hai Plain have achieved significant results in just one year, producing notable social and economic benefits.

Today's meeting of the China Agricultural University's Yellow-Huai-Hai Work Conference revealed that in 1988, 22 research institutes of the university, with 454 scientific and technical personnel (including over 250 senior researchers), were involved in the development work of the Yellow-Huai-Hai region. This work covered 51 counties and cities with over 60 million mu (approximately 400 million acres) of arable land, achieving both scientific research and development successes. In terms of land resource development and utilization, the application of a suite of technologies to 360,000 mu of demonstration areas and 740,000 mu of expanded areas in Shangqiu County alone yielded direct economic benefits of over 38 million yuan.

In the promotion of superior varieties and cultivation techniques, they cultivated over 100 superior varieties for the Yellow-Huai-Hai region, including 52 varieties of wheat, with a total promotion area of 320 million mu. They also promoted 14 varieties of hybrid corn, with a total promotion area of over 31 million mu. It is estimated that the promotion of superior varieties of wheat and corn in Dezhou alone will increase grain production by 210 million kilograms. In terms of water-saving irrigation and formula fertilization, they promoted water-saving agricultural technologies in Shangqiu, Henan, achieving results in water conservation, energy conservation, cost reduction, and increased production. In Shandong, they promoted formula fertilization, with 245,000 mu of wheat, 100,000 mu of corn, and 3,500 mu of cotton promoted in Yucheng and Lingxian counties.

In large-scale high-yield contracting, they jointly contracted nearly 100,000 mu of summer corn in Yucheng County last year, with an average yield of 447 kilograms per mu, an increase of 89 kilograms per mu compared to 1987, a 24.9% increase in production, and an additional income of 360 million yuan.

It is worth noting that in the production of paper from ramie, the new ramie variety suitable for papermaking, cultivated by the Institute of Ramie, has been successfully planted in Yucheng, covering 20,000 mu, with a yield of 1 ton of dry ramie per mu and a pulping rate of 35%. They have jointly established a ramie pulp mill with a production capacity of 100,000 tons per year with local authorities and plan to expand the planting of ramie to 150,000 mu in Yucheng, which can yield 150,000 tons of ramie and produce over 50,000 tons of pulp. This will help alleviate the shortage of paper supply in China.

　　中国农科院黄淮海开发一年见成效
    科学唤来粮棉　红麻造出纸浆
    本报北京１月４日讯  记者何黄彪报道：中国农业科学院开发黄淮海平原一年来，已经打开局面，形成规模，产生了显著的社会和经济效益。
    今天召开的中国农科院黄淮海工作会议透露，１９８８年，该院有２２个研究所的４５４名科技人员（其中高级研究人员２５０多名），投入了黄淮海地区的开发工作，涉及５１个县、市的６０００多万亩耕地，科研与开发均获得丰收。其中，在土地资源的开发利用方面，仅在商丘县向３６万亩示范区和７４万亩扩散区配套技术，就取得直接经济效益３８００多万元。在推广良种和栽培技术方面，他们为黄淮海地区培育出１００多个优良品种，仅小麦有５２个，推广总面积达到３．２亿亩，玉米杂交种１４个，推广总面积３１００多万亩。预计仅德州地区实现小麦、玉米良种化一项，即可增产粮食２．１亿公斤。在节水灌溉和配方施肥方面，他们在河南商丘推广节水农业技术，已取得了节水、节能、降低成本、增加产量的效果；在山东推广配方施肥，仅禹城、陵县就推广小麦２４．５万亩，玉米１０万亩，棉花３５００亩。
    在大面积丰产承包方面，他们去年共同承包的禹城县近１０万亩夏玉米，平均亩产达４４７公斤，比１９８７年平均亩产增加８９公斤，即增产２４．９％，增收３６０万元。
    可喜的是，在红麻造纸方面，麻类所培育出的适于造纸用的红麻新品种已在禹城种植成功，共达２万亩，亩产干麻１吨，出浆率３５％。他们和地方联合筹建了年产万吨的红麻纸浆厂，并计划在禹城扩种红麻１５万亩，可收红麻１５万吨，制浆５万多吨，对缓解我国纸张供应不足将起一定作用。
