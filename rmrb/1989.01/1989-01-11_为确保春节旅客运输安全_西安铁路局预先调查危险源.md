To ensure the safety of passenger transportation during the Spring Festival, the Xi'an Railway Bureau has conducted preemptive investigations into hazardous sources.

On January 7 last year, the 272nd passenger train from Guangzhou to Xi'an caught fire due to a passenger illegally carrying paint, resulting in 64 people being burned to death or injured. This major accident has become a constant reminder for the Xi'an Railway Bureau to persistently focus on train safety.

During an interview, a responsible person from the railway bureau said that although the railway system has been consistently vigilant, some passengers still carry flammable, explosive, and hazardous items on board. According to incomplete statistics, in December last year alone, the entire bureau discovered 19 incidents involving these items, confiscating 169 detonators, 51 kilograms of explosives, 15 meters of fuse, 13,000 paper firecrackers, and 520,000 firecrackers. This poses a serious threat to railway safety. The work of preventing these items from entering the station and boarding the train, although significant efforts have been invested each year, some lawbreakers have become increasingly adept at evading checks with hidden methods. Facing this situation, the bureau has adopted new measures.

Starting from the fourth quarter of last year, the Xi'an Railway Bureau, with the support and cooperation of local public security departments, conducted a systematic investigation into the major distribution, production, sales, and storage of these items within its jurisdiction, ensuring they have a clear understanding. They appeal to governments and relevant departments at all levels to strengthen the management and safety supervision of these units, preventing these items from entering railway stations and trains.

　　为确保春节旅客运输安全
    西安铁路局预先调查危险源
    本报讯  记者景险峰报道：去年１月７日，广州开往西安的２７２次客车因一名旅客违章携带油漆，当场烧死、烧伤６４人。这一重大事故如今变成西安铁路分局坚持抓好行车安全工作的长鸣警钟。
    这个铁路分局负责人接受采访时说，尽管铁路系统常抓不懈，旅客中一些人携带易燃品、易爆品、危险品乘车的现象依然存在。据不完全统计，仅去年１２月份，全分局共查获“三品”１９起，收缴雷管１６９枚、炸药５１公斤、导火索１５米、纸炮１．３万余响、鞭炮５２万头……这对铁路行车安全构成严重威胁。防止“三品”进站上车的宣传、查堵工作，每年投入的力量不算少，但个别不法分子携带“三品”逃避检查的手段，也越来越隐蔽。面对这一形势，分局采取了新的政策。
    从去年第４季度开始，西安铁路分局在地方公安部门的支持配合下，对管辖范围内主要的“三品”集散地、产地、运销、储存情况，进行了系统的调查，做到“心中有数”。他们呼吁各级政府和主管部门，加强对上述单位的管理和安全监督，防止“三品”流入铁路车站和列车。
