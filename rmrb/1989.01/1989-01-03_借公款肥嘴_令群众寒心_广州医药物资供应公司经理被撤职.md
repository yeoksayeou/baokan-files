The manager of the Guangzhou Pharmaceutical and Medical Supplies Company, Fang Peichu, has repeatedly engaged in extravagant wastefulness. Recently, he was voted a vote of no confidence by the public. The higher authorities, in accordance with public opinion, have removed him from his managerial position.

According to public reports, during his tenure, Fang Peichu squandered public funds extensively. Not long ago, he hosted a banquet for three people from a higher-level business department, with the company's manager and deputy manager, among five others, accompanying them. A single banquet cost 2,126.5 yuan in public funds. Because the amount was large, Fang Peichu instructed the issuance of four receipts to be distributed among subordinate units and cooperative units for reimbursement, in order to cover up the expenditure.

When the leadership is corrupt, the subordinates follow suit. The entire company was plagued by a bad atmosphere of extravagance and waste, which caused public discontent. Fang Peichu, who believed that "feasting and entertaining would win hearts," received a vote of no confidence from 60 out of 86 party members in the company during a recent public opinion poll. A majority of the cadres and masses also voted no confidence in him.

　　借公款肥嘴　令群众寒心
    广州医药物资供应公司经理被撤职
    本报广州１月２日电  记者梁兆明报道：广州市医药物资供应公司经理房培楚，屡屡奢侈浪费，不久前被群众投了不信任票。上级主管部门顺从民意，撤销了他的经理职务。
    据群众反映，房培楚在职期间大肆挥霍公款，不久前宴请上级业务部门３人，公司正副经理等５人作陪。一桌酒席竟挥霍公款２１２６．５元。由于数额大，房培楚授意开４张发票摊派给下属单位和协作单位报销，以掩人耳目。
    上梁不正下梁歪，全公司奢侈浪费的不良风气盛行，引起群众不满。自以为“饮饮食食得人心”的房培楚，在最近的一次民意测验中，公司的８６名党员，有６０名给他投了不信任票，干部群众中给他投不信任票的也占大多数。
