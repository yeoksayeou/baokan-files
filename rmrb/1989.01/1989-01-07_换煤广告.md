In October 1988, our city's fuel company purchased over 1,000 tons of coal. This batch of coal contained a significant amount of coal gangue, making its quality very poor.

On November 7, after returning from a business trip, Manager Yang Han Tao heard the complaints. He immediately convened a meeting that night. The next day, notices were posted everywhere, inviting residents who had bought the substandard coal to come and exchange it. However, not many residents came to exchange the coal.

Yang Han Tao then discussed with several deputy managers and decided to go to the city television station to make an advertisement, so that more residents would know about the coal exchange. Some colleagues said: "The notices have already been posted, which means our work has been done. We can exchange as much as we can." Yang Han Tao did not agree with this view. He took a check for 1,000 yuan and went to the city television station to make the advertisement, publicly apologizing to all the residents of the city and earnestly requesting those who had bought the substandard coal to come and exchange it. When the residents came to exchange the coal, Manager Yang Han Tao and several deputy managers apologized to them again.

　　换煤广告
    １９８８年１０月，我市燃料公司购进了１０００多吨煤。这批煤因为含有较多煤矸石，质量很差。
    １１月７日，刚刚出差归来的杨汉涛经理听到反映后，连夜召开大会。第二天四处张贴布告，让买了劣质煤的居民前来换煤。可是，来换煤的居民并不多。
    杨汉涛又和几位副经理商量，决定到市电视台做广告，让更多的居民知道换煤消息。有的同志说：布告已经贴出去了，说明我们的工作已经做到家了，能换多少算多少。杨汉涛不同意这种说法。他拿了１０００元支票，到市电视台做了广告，公开向全市居民检讨，恳请购买了劣质煤的居民来换煤。在居民来换煤的时候，杨汉涛经理和几位副经理还再次向他们赔礼道歉。
