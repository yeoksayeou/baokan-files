The Nude Art Exhibition Stirs Beijing

At the end of the Year of the Dragon, the first nude oil painting art exhibition in Beijing caused a sensation. Workers, peasants, soldiers, students, individual entrepreneurs, as well as elderly men with white hair and walking sticks, and lively children all flocked to the National Art Museum of China.

During the exhibition, the organizers also received invitations from several art associations and museums in Beijing, Shanghai, and Shenzhen, which shows the extent of the exhibition's impact!

Over 80 news agencies based in Beijing, both domestic and foreign, closely followed the news generated by the exhibition.

Why did the nude art exhibition cause such a stir in Beijing at the end of the 1980s? It is worth pondering.

Some people believe that nude art has been a long-sealed taboo in our country. Once the taboo is broken, it unleashes a pent-up force. It is undeniable that many people came to see the novelty and excitement. But nude art is an enlightenment of beauty, morality, and science. Its enlightenment effect will undoubtedly be proven by future facts.

Others believe that our country is currently in a period of realizing human value. Nude art reminds people not to forget that humans are the center and master of art and science. Nude art raises people's self-awareness, cultivates their emotions, and stimulates their rationality, thereby making people more cherish their rights as human beings.

After more than ten days of exhibition, people's discussions focused not only on the paintings themselves but also on various ethical, human nature, and human rights issues that arose from the exhibition.

The Model Controversy

The artists tried to depict humans in their works but inadvertently sparked a small controversy involving the models.

Models A and B both volunteered to pose at the Central Academy of Fine Arts. In our country, which has experienced thousands of years of feudal society, their courage to dedicate themselves to art is particularly rare. However, for various reasons, they hid this fact from their husbands and relatives.

A went to see the exhibition on the opening day. When she was recognized by some viewers and subjected to malicious remarks in the exhibition hall, she felt immense psychological pressure. Coupled with her husband's lack of understanding, she was extremely distressed.

B's situation was like a story: On the opening night of the exhibition, she walked with her husband on the street for two hours. She wanted to avoid the news broadcast time on TV. If her husband saw from the TV that his wife was the model in the artists' paintings, the consequences would be unimaginable. She managed to get past her husband, but she never expected that her in-laws would recognize her from the TV news that night. The next day, B's husband returned home, and his parents angrily scolded him: "She has brought shame to our family."

Thus, the models demanded the removal of related works from the exhibition; they believed the exhibition infringed upon their image rights; they sought legal representation and protection; they demanded increased wages and economic compensation, etc.

Did the exhibition infringe upon the models' image rights? Opinions varied.

Some said that during the painting process, the artists had infused their artistic creation, and once it became an artwork, it should belong to the artist. It should not be considered an infringement on the model.

On January 4, 1989, the lawyers representing models A and B held a press conference for domestic and foreign journalists. The lawyers claimed that the exhibition's organizers and related publishers had infringed upon A and B's image rights and reputation. Their reasoning was based on Article 100 of the Civil Code.

However, others believed that the lawyers representing A and B, who claimed that the organizers and publishers had infringed upon their rights, indicated that our civil law is incomplete. The current "Civil Code" needs further improvement. Otherwise, civil disputes in artistic creation will become more and more frequent.

"Know Thyself"

In recent days, the number of visitors to the nude art exhibition has been increasing. This reminds one of the inscription on the wall of the Temple of Apollo: "Know thyself!" For countless years, this ancient yet ever-new adage has inspired generation after generation of explorers. Sociologists and natural scientists have revealed the mysteries of humans from various different angles, continuously expanding our understanding of ourselves to new depths and breadths.

Some people say the exhibition's impact reflects a change in national aesthetic attitudes, a cultural development phenomenon in society. Of course, the exhibition itself is far from comparable to the cultural impact it has produced. However, it has opened a new chapter in the study of human body culture and has sparked various beneficial reflections on ourselves.

　　人体画展引出的社会思考
    本报记者  赖仁琼
    人体画展动京城
    龙年岁末，首届人体油画艺术大展轰动了京城。懂艺术和不懂艺术的工人、农民、军人、学生、个体户，以至白发苍苍、策杖而行的老翁、天真活泼的儿童都涌向中国美术馆。
    展出期间，组织者还接到了北京、上海、深圳几家美协、博物馆的邀请，由此可见，人体画展的轰动是强烈的！
    驻京８０多家新闻单位的中外记者密切关注画展爆出的新闻。
    ２０世纪８０年代末，人体画展为何在京城引起如此轰动？耐人寻味。
    有人认为，人体艺术在我国是被长期封闭的禁区，而禁区一旦打开，便有蓄之既久、发之必速之势。不可否认，有不少人是来看稀奇、看热闹的。但人体艺术是美的启蒙、道德的启蒙、科学的启蒙，它的启蒙效应必然为今后的事实所证明。
    也有人认为，我国目前处于实现人的价值时期。人体艺术提醒人们，千万不要忘记人是艺术和科学的中心和主人。人体艺术提高了人的自我认识水平，陶冶了人的感情，启发了人的理性，从而使人更加珍视自己做人的权利。
    展出十余天，人们的议论热点不仅在绘画作品本身，而且在于由此引出的关于伦理、人性、人权等种种议论。
    模特儿风波
    画家们力图在作品中表现人，但却因对人的某些疏忽而引发了一场不大不小的模特儿风波。
    模特儿Ａ和Ｂ都是自愿去中央美院当模特的。在我们这个历经了几千年封建社会的国度，她们这种为艺术献身的勇气是十分难能可贵的。但由于种种原因，她们向自己的丈夫和亲属隐瞒了这件事。
    Ａ在画展开幕的当天去看画展，当她在展厅被个别观众认出并遭到恶语中伤时，精神压力很大。加之丈夫的不理解，使她分外痛苦。
    Ｂ的境遇说来就像一个故事：画展开幕的当晚，她拉丈夫在大街上逛了两个小时，她想借此错过电视的新闻节目时间。如果丈夫从电视里看出妻子竟是画家笔下的模特儿，那后果是不堪设想的。丈夫这一关倒是躲过了，但她哪会想到，公婆却从当晚的电视新闻里辨认出来了。第二天，Ｂ的丈夫回家，父母气愤地数落他：“她把我们家的脸都丢尽了。”
    于是，模特儿要求撤换画展的有关作品；并认为画展侵犯了她们的肖像权；找代理律师，寻求法律保护；要求增加工资，给予经济赔偿等等。
    是否侵犯了模特儿的肖像权呢？各方议论又不尽一致。
    有人说，画家在作画过程已渗进了自己的艺术创作，一旦成为艺术品，就应属画家所有。不能看作是对模特儿的侵权行为。
    １９８９年１月４日，模特Ａ、Ｂ的代理律师举行中外记者新闻发布会，代理律师宣称，画展的主办单位和有关出版社已构成侵犯Ａ、Ｂ的肖像权和名誉权。其理由是依据民法第１００条的规定。
    有人却认为，Ａ、Ｂ的代理律师认为主办者和出版单位侵权，正说明我国民法不周全，目前施行的《民法通则》有待进一步完善。否则，艺术创作中的民事纠纷将会越来越多。
    “认识你自己”
    连日来，人体画大展的观众有增无减。这令人想起刻在阿波罗神庙墙上的神谕：“认识你自己！”多少年来，这古老而常新的箴言激励着一代又一代探索者的心。社会学家和自然科学家从各个不同的角度揭示人的奥秘，使人类对自身的认识不断开拓出新的深度与广度。
    有人说画展的轰动反映了民族审美心态的变革，是社会的文化发展现象。当然，画展本身远远比不上它所产生的文化效应。但是，它却掀开了研究人体文化的新阶段，并由此引发了我们对于人自身的种种有益的思考。
