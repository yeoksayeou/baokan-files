	Strengthening Grassroots Petition Work and Diverting Cases to Audit and Supervision Departments

	Petition Cases to the Central Government Decrease

	Current Petitions Primarily Involve Economic Issues

	XINHUA NEWS AGENCY, XI'AN, January 19 (Reporters Liu Erning, Hua Nianlun) - Lu Linsheng, Deputy Director of the Information Office of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China and the State Council, revealed today that the number of petition cases from various provinces to the central government has significantly decreased last year.

	This deputy director said that in 1988, the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China and the State Council Information Office received over 520,000 letters from the public, a reduction of one-third compared to the previous year; they handled over 40,000 visits, a reduction of one-fourth compared to the previous year. The majority of provinces, municipalities, and autonomous regions have seen a stable or decreasing trend in the number of petitions, while a few places have remained roughly the same or slightly increased compared to the previous year.

	Lu Linsheng said at the conclusion of the Shaanxi Provincial Petition Work Conference today that the reasons for the decrease in petitions include: first, the work of implementing policies has been basically completed, and historical legacy issues are now few; second, due to the attention of leaders at all levels, grassroots petition work has been strengthened, with some places implementing responsibility systems and target management, ensuring that problems are addressed at the grassroots level, and many people no longer bypass levels to petition; third, the establishment of audit, supervision departments, and reporting centers has diverted some of the petition workload.

	Lu Linsheng said that currently, the content of petitions has changed: there are more real-life issues; more economic issues; more criticisms and supervisions; and more collective issues. He pointed out that currently, petition departments should focus on petition information work, serve to improve the economic environment, rectify economic order, and deepen comprehensive reforms, serve to promote the integrity of party and government officials, and help the public resolve difficulties and do more practical work.

　　基层信访工作加强　审计监察部门分流    
    各地向中央投诉信访案件减少    
    目前信访反映的经济类问题多
    新华社西安１月１９日电（记者刘尔宁、华年轮）中共中央办公厅和国务院办公厅信访局副局长卢林生今天披露：去年全国各地向中央投诉的信访案件明显减少。
    这位副局长说，１９８８年，中共中央办公厅和国务院办公厅信访局收到群众来信５２万多件，比上一年减少１／３；接待来访４万多案次，比上一年减少１／４。多数省、市、区信访的数量稳中有降，少数地方与上一年基本持平或略有增加。
    卢林生在今天结束的陕西省信访工作会议上说，信访数量减少的原因，一是落实政策的工作基本结束，历史遗留问题已经很少；二是由于各级领导的重视，基层的信访工作加强了，有的地方落实了责任制，实行了目标管理，层层有人做工作，把大量的问题解决在基层，许多群众不再越级上访；三是审计、监察部门和举报中心设立后分流了一部分信访量。
    卢林生说，目前信访反映的问题在内容构成上有所变化：现实问题增多；经济类问题增多；批评监督增多；群体性问题增多。他指出，当前信访部门要抓好信访信息工作，为治理经济环境、整顿经济秩序和全面深化改革服务，要为促进党政干部的廉洁服务，为群众排忧解难，多办实事。
