	Over a hundred backyard refineries seriously threaten the production of key state enterprises.
	The "time bomb" in the Daqing Oilfield urgently needs to be defused.

	According to Xinhua News Agency, reporter Chen Jianfa reports: The reporter recently visited the Daqing Oilfield, which he had not seen for three years, and found that many extremely crude backyard refineries had sprung up in this vast, modern oilfield. The thick smoke billowing from these refineries and the piles of broken oil drums on the ground are completely at odds with the neat oil fields.

	A manager from the Fifth Oil Extraction Plant angrily said, "These backyard refineries are time bombs placed in the oilfield." Many of these refineries lack basic fire safety equipment, are highly flammable and explosive, and are located close to the oil wells. If a fire or explosion were to occur, it would endanger the safety of the oilfield, with dire consequences. It is understood that these backyard refineries obtain their raw materials and fuel entirely from the oilfield. They use all sorts of means, including theft, looting, bribery, and resale, causing significant corruption within the oilfield workforce.

	According to investigations by relevant departments in Daqing, there are 117 backyard refineries in the old oilfield area alone. Among these, 64 are located within the oil extraction area, and 53 are in the peripheral areas, with a total daily processing capacity of over 2,700 tons. Of these refineries, 23 operate without a license, while the remaining 94 have business licenses. Some, to avoid suspicion, are named chemical plants, asphalt plants, or waste recycling plants, but in reality, they all use one or two crude oil furnaces to produce substandard mixed diesel, which is then sold at high prices to other regions.

　　百余家土炼油厂严重威胁国家重点企业生产    
    大庆油田的“定时炸弹”亟待清除
    据新华社电  记者陈坚发报道：记者新近到阔别三年的大庆油田采访，发现在这座辽阔的现代化油田上，平添了许多无法再简陋的土炼油厂。这些土炼油厂冒出的滚滚浓烟，场地上堆放的破油桶，与整洁的油区极不协调。
    采油五厂一位管理者忿忿地说，这些土炼油厂是安放在油田上的“定时炸弹”。不少土炼油厂根本没有消防安全设施，易燃易爆，离油井又较近。一旦发生起火、爆炸，将危及油田安全，后果令人担忧。据了解，这些土炼油厂的原料、燃料全部取之于油田，他们偷盗、哄抢、行贿、倒卖等种种手段无所不用，对油田职工队伍的腐蚀相当大。
    据大庆有关部门调查，仅在大庆老油区就有土炼油厂１１７个。其中建在采油区内的６４个，建在边缘区域的５３个，总计日加工能力达２７００多吨。在这些土炼油厂中，除２３个无执照外，其余９４个均领有企业营业执照。有的为避嫌疑，冠以化工厂、沥青厂、废品再生加工厂等名，实际上都是用一两座土油炉生产劣质混合柴油，然后高价倒卖给外地。
