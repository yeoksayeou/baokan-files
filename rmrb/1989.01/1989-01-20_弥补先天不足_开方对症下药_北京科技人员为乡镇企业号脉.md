Title: Making Up for Innate Deficiencies and Prescribing Remedies

Some scientific and technical personnel in Beijing have recently taken on the role of "doctors," diagnosing and prescribing remedies for township enterprises at the invitation of the municipal Science and Technology Commission.

This is part of Beijing's deepening implementation of the "Spark" program. Last year, 64 managers, equipment, process, quality engineers, and accountants from large and medium-sized enterprises in Beijing were dispatched to 100 township enterprises to conduct technical and management diagnoses.

Beijing has established 17,000 township enterprises during its rural reforms. These enterprises have played a positive role, but like elsewhere, they generally suffer from innate deficiencies. Most enterprise leaders, having just put down their hoes, became managers. They lack management skills and enterprise knowledge and capabilities, with some even using management methods from production teams. Rules and regulations, as well as operating procedures, are also very incomplete and are often executed carelessly.

The participating scientific and technical personnel did not prescribe a uniform "remedy" for these enterprises or use "patent medicines." Instead, they conducted individual investigations and made itemized suggestions. According to statistics, they proposed more than 800 suggestions and revised more than 500 management regulations and methods for these enterprises.

This has brought widespread benefits to township enterprises. The monthly production value of the Jinhui Wire Factory in Chaoyang District has been hovering around 1.5 million yuan for several years. The "doctors" helped the factory streamline various links, and in October and November last year, the monthly production value exceeded 1.9 million yuan. The "prescription" given to the Xiji Metal Products Factory in Tong County was to redefine labor time quotas and material, energy consumption standards, which increased the factory's production value by 8 million yuan.

Like hospital doctors, the participating technical personnel also taught the "patients" how to "exercise" by training personnel for township enterprises and improving the quality of workers; they adopted a follow-up visit method to track and check the effects of the "medicine." According to the eight standards set by Beijing Municipality, 54 township enterprises have been approved for passing the inspection so far.

Regarding the question of whether the "diagnosis" will affect the flexible mechanism of township enterprises, relevant officials from the Beijing Municipal Science and Technology Commission replied: It will not.

　　弥补先天不足　开方对症下药
    北京科技人员为乡镇企业号脉
    本报讯  记者陈祖甲报道：北京的一些科技人员近年来当起“大夫”，市科委聘请他们为乡镇企业“号脉”、“开处方”。
    这是北京市“星火”计划深入开展的一个内容。去年，６４名在北京的大中企业厂长，设备、工艺、质量工程师和会计师，先后被派往１００个乡镇企业进行技术和管理诊断。
    北京市在农村改革中已办起１．７万家乡镇企业。这些企业起了积极作用，但同其它地方一样，普遍存在先天不足。大多数企业的负责人刚搁下锄头便当上厂长，管理技术和企业的知识与能力非常缺乏，有的甚至沿用生产队的管理办法，规章制度、操作规程也极不健全，执行时马马虎虎。
    参加“诊断”的科技人员没有给这些企业开统一的“处方”，不吃“成药”，而是一个个调查，逐项提出建议。据统计，他们总共为这些企业提出了８００多条建议，修改了５００多份管理制度和办法。
    这使乡镇企业普遍得到实惠。朝阳区金辉电线厂几年来的月产值在１５０万左右徘徊。“大夫”们帮助这个厂理顺了各个环节的关系，去年１０、１１两个月，月产值突破１９０万。“大夫”给通县西集金属制品厂开的“处方”是重新核定工时定额和物资消耗、能源消耗的指标，这一措施为工厂多创产值８０万元。
    像医院的大夫一样，参加“诊断”的技术人员还教会“病人”进行“健身锻炼”，为乡镇企业培训人员，提高职工素质；采取回访的方式，追踪检查“服药”后的效果。按照北京市制定的８条标准验收，目前已有５４个乡镇企业获准通过。
    对于“诊断”是否会影响乡镇企业灵活机制发挥的问题，北京市科委有关人士回答说：不会。
