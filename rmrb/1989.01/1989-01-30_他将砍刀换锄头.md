Life in the mountainous region of Tonggu County in western Jiangxi Province, farmer Shou Hankang was once sentenced to prison for a year and a half for illegal logging, becoming a criminal who violated the Forest Law. After his release, he decided to stand up where he fell and become an upright person. Together with his wife, he contracted a barren hill of over 80 acres, cultivating and planting economic fruit trees such as peaches, plums, oranges, chestnuts, broad-leaved osmanthus, and tea. He became one of the earliest and most successful artificial fruit orchards in the surrounding mountainous areas. In recent years, many cadres and villagers have visited, praising him for his contributions to the development of barren hills.

Shou Hankang is 42 years old this year, of medium build, and appears sturdy and strong. He originally hails from Zhujia County in Zhejiang Province and once served as the village branch secretary.

In 1981, Tonggu County seriously investigated and punished illegal logging. It was discovered that over 100 cubic meters of pine and fir had been illegally logged in Yongfeng Village, Pai Bu Township, and Guangming Village, Shiqiao Township. Shou Hankang, who was responsible for the logging in these two villages, was the main culprit and was subsequently handcuffed and sent to prison.

A bumpy journey made him realize that illegal logging violates the Forest Law and that serving time in prison was deserved. However, he did not lose heart. After being released from prison in 1983, he decided to use his sweat to wash away the past and make contributions to forestry development. Having lived in the county for 10 years, he deeply loved this mountainous area. He believed that the mountains, water, and climate here were ideal for tree growth. As long as he exchanged his axe for a hoe, the barren hills could be turned into orchards.

He wasted no time. Shou Hankang signed a contract with Pai Bu Township, and the township government handed over an 80-acre barren hill by the roadside for him to manage, stipulating that the management period would not change for 30 years. For the first five years of operating the orchard, no money or goods would be handed over, and after five years, a certain proportion of money would be paid. In the early stages of the orchard's operation, the township government also provided support and assistance in terms of loans.

Shou Hankang, together with his wife, made the mountain their home, building houses on it. The family worked tirelessly, day and night, to dig the mountain and cultivate the land, accumulating and making fertilizer, and raising pigs and chickens. They prepared the land in the first year and planted in the second, dividing the entire mountain into three planting sections: peaches, pears, plums, and oranges on the mountain top; tea, kumquats, and broad-leaved osmanthus seedlings on the mountain slope; watermelons, peanuts, and red flowers on the mountain foot. After two years of effort, Shou Hankang's orchard already had 33 acres of tea trees and over 50 acres of fruit trees. Under the careful management of Shou Hankang and his wife, the tea trees on the mountain slope were already lush and green, and last year they harvested over 10,000 pounds of fresh tea. The peaches and plums on the mountain were flourishing, providing fruit to the market every year. Last year, the orchard's pure income from tea and fruit reached 120,000 yuan. Currently, Shou Hankang and his wife are setting up a coarse tea processing factory, and the income will be even more substantial.

　　他将砍刀换锄头
    熊典达
    生活在赣西北山区铜鼓县的农民寿汉康，过去因滥伐林木被判刑坐牢一年半，成了触犯森林法的罪犯。出狱后，他决心在哪里跌跤就要在哪里爬起，做一个堂堂正正的人，同妻子一起，承包了一座８０多亩面积的荒山，开垦种植了桃、李、桔、板栗、广玉兰和茶叶等经济果树林，成了周围山区办得早、效益好的人工果园。近几年，有不少干部和群众到此参观，人们赞扬他为荒山开发立了一功。
    寿汉康今年４２岁，中等身材，看上去结实健壮。他原是浙江省诸暨县人，曾担任过村团支部书记。
    １９８１年，铜鼓县严肃查处乱砍滥伐时，查出排埠乡永丰村和石桥乡光明村在山上超伐松杉１００多立方米。负责这两村砍伐的包工头寿汉康应负主要责任，于是，寿汉康被带上手铐，进了监狱。
    坎坷的经历使他明白了，滥砍乱伐林木，违犯了森林法，坐大牢是罪有应得。然而他没有灰心丧志，１９８３年出狱后，决心用汗水洗涤过去，要在林业开发中做出贡献。在县生活过１０年的他，深深爱上了这个山区。他认为这里山好水好气候也好，最适宜林木生长。只要将砍刀换成锄头，荒山就能变成果园。
    说干就干。寿汉康同排埠乡签订了一份合同，乡政府将公路边上一座８０多亩面积的荒山交给他经营，规定经营期３０年不变。办园林场的前５年内不上交任何钱物，５年后按一定比例交款。在办场初期，乡政府还在贷款等方面给予支持和帮助。
    寿汉康同妻子一起，以山为家，在山上建起了房屋。一家人起早贪黑，挖山垦地，长年不息，积肥造肥，还养起了猪和鸡。头年整地来年种，把整个山地划分成三个种植段：山上种桃、梨、李和柑桔；山腰种茶叶、金桔、广玉兰苗圃；山脚种西瓜、花生、红花草。经过两年努力，寿汉康的果林园已拥有茶叶树面积３３亩，果树５０多亩。在寿汉康夫妇的精心管理下，山腰上的茶叶树已一片碧绿，去年摘获鲜茶已达万斤。山上桃李干枝舒展，年年都有水果供应市场。去年这个场茶果纯收入已达１．２万元。目前，寿汉康夫妇正在兴办一个粗制茶加工厂，收入将更加可观。
