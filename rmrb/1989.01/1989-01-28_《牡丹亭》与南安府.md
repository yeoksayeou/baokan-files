Jiangxi Dayu, formerly known as Nan'an, has a deep connection between the Nan'an Prefecture's garden and its ten scenic spots, as well as its plum blossoms, willows, and peonies, with the Ming dynasty playwright Tang Xianzu's creation of "The Peony Pavilion."

The plum blossoms on the Meiling Mountains in southern Jiangxi are famous worldwide. The willows along the banks of the Zhangjiang River in Nan'an Prefecture are graceful and elegant. What is even more captivating is the peonies of Nan'an Prefecture. From the Song to the Ming dynasties, eleven officials from Shandong and Henan provinces transplanted the peony kings from Luoyang and Caozhou to Nan'an. Using the national beauty and fragrant flowers, they enhanced the charm of the ancient city, and the stories and anecdotes have lasted for generations. The custom of flower festivals continues to this day.

Inside the Nan'an Prefecture's government office, there is a garden with scenic spots such as the Dressing Table, Jade Pool Hermitage, Peony Pavilion, Shuxiao Pavilion, Green Shade Pavilion, and Iron Banana Dragon.

Nan'an has a beautiful legend. It tells of a banana tree spirit in the government office garden that fell in love with the magistrate's daughter. The magistrate was angry and blamed his daughter, who then jumped into a well and died. Later, a stone slab was used to cover the well, and a mound of earth was used to create a grave. The daughter's body did not rot, and her soul did not disperse. She appeared in the dreams of a passing scholar, promising to marry him if he saved her. Later, the scholar passed the imperial examinations, dug up the well, found her, and they got married and lived happily ever after. This legend is remarkably similar to the plot of "The Peony Pavilion"!

In the 19th year of the Wanli reign (1591), Tang Xianzu was demoted to the position of a minor official in Xuhui after offending powerful officials with his memorial. Tang, who believed in "true love," passed through Nan'an with a heavy heart and a sense of injustice. The following year, his injustice was rectified, and he was transferred to the position of magistrate in Suichang, passing through Nan'an again. Tang's emotional turmoil during his two passages through Nan'an can be imagined. The legend of the "banana tree spirit" in Nan'an, which holds that "the dead can be brought back to life," along with the beauty of the plum blossoms, willows, and peonies, as well as the magistrate Du Zhong (who seems to be the prototype of Du Bao), were all used by Tang as material for his masterpiece "The Peony Pavilion." The Peony Pavilion, Kehua Lane, Plum Blossom Observatory, and Liliang's Tomb in the ten scenic spots of the Nan'an Prefecture's government office garden all match the scenes in "The Peony Pavilion." There are eleven instances in "The Peony Pavilion" where the text refers to events that took place in Jiangxi's Nan'an. It is clear that the scenery of Nan'an played a catalytic role in the creation of "The Peony Pavilion."

The Peony Pavilion was destroyed in the war, and although the scenery has changed, the spirit remains—the two fragrant magnolia trees in front of the old site are still there. In 1963, Comrade Tian Han visited the old site of the Peony Pavilion and left a poem in remembrance.

　　《牡丹亭》与南安府
    熊岳
    江西大余古称南安，南安府的府署园林十景和梅、柳、牡丹与明代戏剧家汤显祖创作《牡丹亭》深有渊源。
    赣南梅岭上的梅花早已闻名于世，南安府章江两岸的垂柳纤丝袅娜。更吸引人的是南安府的牡丹。自宋至明有十一位来自山东、河南的府治官员把洛阳、曹州的牡丹花王移植南安。借国色天香，增古邑俏丽，佳话轶事经久难泯。花会习俗相沿至今。
    南安府衙内有一座园林，内有梳妆台、玉池精舍、牡丹亭、舒啸阁、绿阴亭、铁蕉龙等景。
    南安有个美丽的传说。说的是府衙园内蕉树成精，热恋衙中小姐，太守怒责其女，小姐投井自尽。后以石板盖井，堆土为坟。小姐尸不腐，魂不散，托梦于过路书生，许身央救。后书生中魁，掘井寻芳，小姐还魂，成亲团圆。这传说与《牡》剧故事梗概何其相似！
    明万历十九年（一五九一）汤显祖因上疏触怒权贵，含冤被贬为徐闻典吏，笃信“至情”之说的汤氏怀着“生者可以死”的愤懑情绪一过南安。翌年冤雪，由徐闻调迁遂昌知县，又过南安。汤氏在两过南安中感情的波动可想而知。南安的“死者可以生”的“蕉精”传说和梅、柳、牡丹的风姿，以及当时太守杜仲（似为杜宝原型）其人，一一被汤氏当作他传世名著《牡丹亭》的素材。南安府署园林十景中的牡丹亭、芍药栏、梅花观、丽娘冢皆与《牡》剧景色相符。《牡》剧中涉及事出江西南安的文字有十一处之多。可见南安风物对于《牡丹亭》的写成实有催生剂的作用。
    牡丹亭早已毁于兵燹，虽说景物全非然风范犹存——旧址前两株芳香四滥的玉兰花仍在。一九六三年田汉同志曾去牡丹亭旧址凭吊，并题诗留念。
