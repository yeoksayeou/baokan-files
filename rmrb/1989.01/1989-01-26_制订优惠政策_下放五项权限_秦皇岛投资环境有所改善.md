	The offices of 16 departments and units, including industry and commerce, taxation, customs, and banking, are all located in a single building to handle procedures. Foreign-invested and cooperative enterprises in Qinhuangdao can complete all necessary procedures, from feasibility studies and project approval to contract and charter approval and the issuance of business licenses, in one building. This move by Qinhuangdao City in Hebei Province has attracted many foreign investors.

	According to relevant sources, in 1988, the Qinhuangdao Development Zone introduced 21 projects, of which 17 were "three-in-one" enterprises. These projects are 2.3 times the total number of projects opened in the previous three years.

	Since Qinhuangdao was opened up in 1984, although a great deal of effort has been invested in improving urban infrastructure and achieving "six connections and one leveling," due to various restrictions, only 9 projects were introduced into the development zone in the first three years. At the beginning of last year, the municipal government took the initiative to improve the soft environment by formulating a series of preferential policies and granting the development zone five authorities: project approval, engineering design, personnel appointments and dismissals, expanded use of foreign exchange, and financial revenue and expenditure. This has motivated the development zone to actively introduce projects.

	To improve work efficiency, the municipal government has also concentrated all the offices related to the development zone projects in the management committee building of the development zone, simplifying the project approval procedures. Now, in the Qinhuangdao Development Zone, the approval of large projects generally does not exceed 15 days, and small ones can be completed in just 3 days. All the "three-in-one" enterprise projects introduced last year in the development zone were handled at a relatively fast pace.

### 制订优惠政策　下放五项权限  秦皇岛投资环境有所改善

　　制订优惠政策　下放五项权限    
    秦皇岛投资环境有所改善
    本报讯  工商、税务、海关、银行等１６家单位和部门的办事机构统一办公，外商投资及合作经营企业从可行性研究报告、立项、合同章程审批到颁发营业执照，一应手续都在一座大楼里完成。河北省秦皇岛市的这一招，吸引了众多的外商前来投资。
    据有关方面人士透露，１９８８年，秦皇岛开发区共引进２１个项目，其中１７个是“三资”企业。这些项目是前三年开办项目总和的２．３倍。
    秦皇岛市自１９８４年开放以来，尽管在改善城市基础设施方面倾注了很大力量，实现了“六通一平”，但由于各种条条框框的限制，前三年引进开发区的项目只有９个。去年年初，市政府从抓软环境的建设入手，先后制订了一系列优惠政策，为开发区下放了审批项目、工程设计、人事任免、扩大外汇使用、财政收支等五权，调动了开发区开办项目的积极性。
    为提高办事效率，市政府还把与开放区项目有关的办事机构全部集中在开发区管委会大楼办公，简化了项目审批手续。现在，在秦皇岛开发区投资办厂，大项目的审批一般不超过１５天，小的只需要３天就可以办理完。去年开发区内新引进的“三资”企业项目，都是以较快速度办理好各种手续的。　（杨振武　杨宝柱）
