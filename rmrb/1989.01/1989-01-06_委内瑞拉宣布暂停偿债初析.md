Title: Venezuela Announces Suspension of Debt Repayment: An Initial Analysis

On December 31 of last year, Venezuelan President Carlos Andrés Pérez in his year-end speech surprisingly announced that starting January 17, 1989, Venezuela would suspend the repayment of its external debts, thus bringing the Latin American debt issue into sharp focus at the beginning of the new year.

At the same time, Venezuelan Finance Minister Miguel Henriquez Urtaño issued a statement detailing the scope of the debt suspension, which includes public external debts owed to international private banks, including the principal of debts rescheduled in 1986 and the principal of debts borrowed before March 22, 1983, that have not been rescheduled. According to relevant sources, the amount of these debts that Venezuela needs to pay this year is approximately $1.5 billion. The finance minister's statement said that multilateral and bilateral official debts, bonds issued by Venezuela abroad, debts guaranteed by foreign official institutions, and foreign trade credits are not included. The governor of the Central Bank of Venezuela stated that interest on external debts will continue to be paid.

Venezuela is the fourth-largest debtor nation in Latin America, with a total external debt of $33 billion, of which the vast majority is public external debt. Unlike other Latin American debtor nations, after the debt crisis erupted in 1982, due to higher oil revenues and foreign exchange reserves ranking at the top in Latin America, Venezuela has not requested rescue loans from the International Monetary Fund, nor has it accepted economic adjustment plans from this multilateral organization. Instead, it has insisted on direct negotiations with international commercial banks. In 1985, Venezuela reached an agreement with international commercial banks to reschedule $26.45 billion in external debts. In 1986 and 1987, it conducted two more rounds of negotiations and reached new agreements. However, perhaps for this very reason, Venezuela's repayment conditions are more unfavorable compared to other major Latin American debtor nations, with shorter repayment periods and higher interest rates, which has caused dissatisfaction among various sectors in Venezuela and has long been a call for renegotiating the debt and seeking favorable repayment conditions.

Due to harsh repayment conditions, Venezuela's external debt burden is extremely heavy. Over the past four years, Venezuela has paid a total of $21 billion in principal and interest on external debts, averaging over $500 million per year. Last year, due to the drop in oil prices, the amount paid for debt repayment accounted for 65% of oil revenues. Debt repayment has caused this rich South American country to have a huge deficit in its international balance of payments and a continuous decline in international reserves. Despite this, the Venezuelan government has consistently adhered to its debt repayment obligations, hoping to rebuild its credit in the international credit market and regain new funds. Starting from July of last year, the authorities sent delegations to the United States, Europe, Japan, and other regions to consult with creditor countries and banks, explain difficulties, and seek new loans. However, these delegations all returned empty-handed. This has made the Venezuelan government and public feel that the current debt repayment situation can no longer be maintained. The finance minister clearly pointed out in his statement that the suspension of debt repayment is a measure taken in light of the results of these visits.

Currently, Venezuela is in a period of transition between the old and new governments. President Pérez's move is to pave the way for the new government to implement a new external debt policy. On the issue of external debt, President-elect Carlos Andrés Pérez takes a more active stance. He advocates for coordinated action among Latin American countries to jointly solve the debt problem. On January 1, Pérez said in an interview with a Mexican news agency before his visit to Mexico, "We Latin American debtor countries have moved away from the illusion of solving the debt problem individually." Recently, he wrote an article titled "Towards a New International Strategy for Debt," discussing the establishment of a multilateral institution specifically responsible for issuing bonds. The feasibility of selling the debts of developing countries at a discount on the international market is considered a way to significantly reduce the debt burden of developing countries. On the issue of domestic debt, Pérez advocates for a comprehensive rescheduling. Next week, Venezuela will send a delegation to the United States. The delegation's task is not only to seek new funds but also to contact various institutions, including the International Monetary Fund, and bring a comprehensive debt adjustment plan. The plan includes demands for lowering interest rates, significantly extending the repayment period, and a bold plan to convert debt into investment. Delegation member Figaredo believes that President Pérez's decision reflects the current economic situation in Venezuela and is also part of President-elect Pérez's debt strategy.

It seems that Venezuela has left room in the issue of suspending debt repayment, and its intention is not to resist the debt but to send a clear message to creditor countries, international multilateral institutions, and creditor banks that Venezuela can no longer continue to repay debts under the original conditions.

### 委内瑞拉宣布暂停偿债初析

　　委内瑞拉宣布暂停偿债初析
    本报记者  朱满庭
    去年１２月３１日，委内瑞拉总统卢辛奇在辞旧迎新的年终讲话中，出人意料地宣布，自１９８９年１月１７日起，委内瑞拉将暂停偿还外债，从而新年一开始就把拉美债务问题提到引人注目的位置上。
    与此同时，委内瑞拉财政部长乌尔塔多发表声明，详细说明暂停偿债的范围是指委内瑞拉拖欠国际私人银行的公共外债，包括１９８６年重新安排过的债务本金和１９８３年３月２２日之前所借尚未重新安排过的债务本金。据有关人士估计，委内瑞拉今年应付的这笔有关债务大约１５亿美元。委财长的声明说，多边与双边的官方债务，委内瑞拉在国外发放的债券、外国官方机构担保的债务和外贸信贷不在其内。委中央银行行长表示，外债利息仍将继续支付。
    委内瑞拉是拉美第４大债务国，外债总额目前为３３０亿美元，其中绝大部分是公共外债。与其他拉美债务国不同的是，１９８２年债务危机爆发后，因石油收入较高，外汇储备居拉美前列，委内瑞拉一直没有向国际货币基金组织提出要求救援性贷款，也不接受这个多边机构的经济调整方案，而是坚持与国际商业银行直接谈判。１９８５年，委内瑞拉与国际商业银行曾就重新安排２６４．５亿美元的外债达成协议，１９８６年和１９８７年又两度进行谈判，并达成新的协议。但也许正是这个原因，委内瑞拉的支付条件比起其他拉美大债务国来更为不利，偿债期短，加息率高，引起委内瑞拉各界的不满，要求重新谈判债务，争取有利的偿付条件的呼声一直很高。
    由于偿债条件苛刻，委内瑞拉外债负担十分沉重。委内瑞拉近４年来共支付外债本息２１０亿美元，每年平均偿付５０多亿美元。去年，由于油价下跌，外债偿付额占石油收入的６５％。外债支付造成了这个富饶的南美国家国际收支亏空巨大，国际储备连年下降。尽管如此，委内瑞拉政府一直坚持信守偿债义务，希冀以此重建在国际信贷市场上的信誉，重新获得新的资金。从去年７月份起，当局接连向美国、欧洲、日本等地区派出代表团，与债权国政府、债权银行磋商，说明困难，寻求新的贷款，但这些代表团都空手而回。这使委内瑞拉朝野感到，目前的偿债格局不能再维持下去了。委内瑞拉财长在声明中明确指出，暂停偿债是鉴于这些访问的结果而采取的措施。
    目前，委内瑞拉正值新旧政府交替之期。卢辛奇总统此举是为下届政府实行新的外债方针铺路。在外债问题上，当选总统佩雷斯采取更为积极的立场。他主张拉美国家协调行动，共同解决外债问题。１月１日，佩雷斯在访问墨西哥前接受墨通社记者的采访时说，“我们拉美债务国已从那种单个地解决债务问题的幻想中走了出来。”前不久，他以《外债走向新的国际战略》为题，撰文论述了建立一种多边机构，专门负责发放债券。在国际市场上打折扣出售发展中国家债务的可行性，认为这是大幅度减少发展中国家债务负担的一个途径。在本国债务问题上，佩雷斯主张全面重新安排。下星期，委内瑞拉将派代表团前往美国，其任务不仅是寻求新资金，而且要同包括国际货币基金组织在内的各方机构接触，并带去了一个全面调整债务的方案，方案包括降低利率、大幅度放宽偿还期等重整债务的要求，还有一个变债务为投资的大胆计划。代表团成员菲格雷多认为，卢辛奇总统的决定既反映了当前委内瑞拉的经济形势，也是当选总统佩雷斯外债战略的一部分。
    看来，委内瑞拉在暂停偿债的问题上是留有余地的，其意图并非要实行抗债，而是要对债权国、国际多边机构和债权银行传达一个明确的信息，即委内瑞拉已不能在原有条件下继续偿债了。　　　　　　　（本报加拉加斯１月３日电）
