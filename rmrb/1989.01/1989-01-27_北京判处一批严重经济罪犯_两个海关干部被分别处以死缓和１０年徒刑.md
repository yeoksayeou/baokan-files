Beijing Sentences a Batch of Serious Economic Criminals
Two Customs Officials Sentenced to Death with Reprieve and 10 Years Imprisonment

Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, January 26th – Reporter Mao Lei reports: Today, the judicial authorities handed down severe punishments to two officials from the Beijing Customs who were bribed by a smuggling gang and participated in smuggling activities.

Today, the Beijing Municipal Intermediate People's Court held a trial and announced the verdict. Beijing Customs Business Department One official, Kang Tiecheng, was sentenced to death with a two-year reprieve for the crime of smuggling, and his political rights were revoked for life. Beijing Customs Business Department One official, Wang Jingsheng, was sentenced to 10 years imprisonment for the crime of smuggling, and his political rights were revoked for two years.

It is understood that Kang Tiecheng and Wang Jingsheng, as customs officials, were enticed and recruited by the smuggling criminal Yan Jianguo (who has already been sentenced to death) between May and November 1986. They helped Yan forge "Customs Passenger Luggage Declaration Forms" and actively provided strategies and handled customs clearance procedures. Yan Jianguo and others illegally smuggled 1,198 tax-exempt foreign exchange goods, including video recorders, color televisions, refrigerators, and tape recorders, valued at 2,699,900 yuan, evading 934,000 yuan in customs duties.

Yan Jianguo and others resold the smuggled tax-exempt goods, illegally profiting 557,000 yuan. Kang Tiecheng profited over 100,000 yuan. Additionally, he colluded with other smugglers, profiting over 200,000 yuan.

In today's sentencing, the Beijing judicial authorities also announced the verdicts for a number of serious economic criminals in recent years. Among them, Li Xueyuan, as the principal responsible person of an economic organization, was sentenced to seven years imprisonment. The embezzlement criminal Zhu Jianguo, who embezzled 190,000 yuan in public funds, was executed by firing squad after the sentencing.
