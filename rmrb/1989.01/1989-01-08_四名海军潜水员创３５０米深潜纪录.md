Four navy divers successfully set a new record by diving to a depth of 350 meters today. They breathed a mixture of helium and oxygen, marking the deepest simulated saturation dive in the country. This achievement signifies a significant advancement in the Chinese Navy's underwater rescue capabilities.

Through various medical monitoring methods, including observations of diving physiology, cardiovascular, and cerebral vascular systems, the divers' health conditions underwater were found to be excellent, and they were able to live normally.

According to the plan, the divers will stay at the 350-meter depth for seven days and nights, conducting routine underwater operations.
