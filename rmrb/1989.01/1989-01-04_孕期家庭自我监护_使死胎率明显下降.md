Prenatal Home Self-Monitoring Significantly Reduces Stillbirth Rate

    Pregnant women counting fetal movements and husbands listening to the fetal heartbeat can promptly understand the condition of the fetus and detect abnormalities for timely treatment. This method of prenatal home self-monitoring can significantly reduce the fetal death rate.

    The China Children's Development Center, Shanghai Scientific Child-rearing Base, and Shanghai Municipal Health Bureau conducted a sample survey, dividing over 13,000 pregnant women in 1987 into a monitoring group and a control group. The perinatal infant mortality rates were 6.30‰ and 10.93‰ respectively, with stillbirth rates of 3.23‰ and 6.31‰ respectively.

    Recently, experts in obstetrics and pediatrics from Beijing and Shanghai evaluated this scientific research and concluded that it has reached an international advanced level.

    For a long time, Shanghai's perinatal infant mortality rate has hovered around 15‰, with stillbirths accounting for about 50%. Since 1980, Zhang Peizhu, former director of the International Peace Maternity and Child Health Hospital, has been exploring methods of family-based self-monitoring of fetal movements and heartbeats to reduce the perinatal infant mortality rate. In 1985, the Shanghai Scientific Child-rearing Base and the Health Bureau organized 19 hospitals to conduct expanded trials, again confirming that prenatal home self-monitoring can reduce the perinatal infant mortality rate.

    The method of home self-monitoring involves pregnant women and their husbands receiving education on the significance and methods of self-monitoring at 30 weeks of pregnancy. Pregnant women count fetal movements 1 to 3 times a day; husbands are taught to use a wooden stethoscope to listen to the fetal heartbeat 1 to 2 times a day. Records are kept for each instance, and any abnormalities are immediately reported to the hospital for verification and treatment.

    This method is simple and does not require special equipment. It can provide hospitals with useful information and detect fetal hypoxia in the womb early, allowing for timely intervention.

    Officials from the World Health Organization have visited Shanghai to inspect this method. They believe that China's experience can be promoted to developing countries.

### 孕期家庭自我监护  使死胎率明显下降

　　孕期家庭自我监护
    使死胎率明显下降
    本报讯  孕妇自己数胎动，丈夫听胎心，可以及时了解胎儿情况，发现异常，及时诊治。这种孕期家庭自我监护方法，能明显地降低胎儿死亡率。
    中国儿童发展中心、上海科学育儿基地和上海市卫生局组织抽样调查，将１９８７年１月至１２月的１３０００多位孕妇分成监护组和对照组，发现两者的围产儿死亡率分别为６．３０‰和１０．９３‰，其中死胎率分别为３．２３‰和６．３１‰。
    前不久，来自北京、上海的妇产科、儿科专家对这项科学研究进行了鉴定，认为已经达到了国际先进水平。
    长期以来，上海的围产儿死亡率徘徊在１５‰左右，其中死胎约占５０％。国际和平妇幼保健院前院长张佩珠自１９８０年起摸索以家庭为单位，进行自我监护胎动、胎心的方法，以降低围产儿死亡率。１９８５年，上海科学育儿基地和卫生局组织１９家医院进行扩大试点，再次证实孕期家庭自我监护有降低围产儿死亡率的作用。
    家庭自我监护的办法是，孕妇在怀孕３０周时，同丈夫一起到医院接受一次“自我监护的意义和方法”的教育。孕妇每天数胎动１至３次；教会丈夫用木听筒听胎心，每天听１至２次。每次都要做记录，发现异常现象即去医院核对、诊治。
    这种方法简便，不需特殊设备，能为医院提供有用的信息，及早发现胎儿宫内缺氧，以及时处理。
    世界卫生组织的官员曾到上海考察这一方法，他们认为中国的这一经验可以向发展中国家推广。
