On January 4, U.S. and Libyan aircraft clashed in the skies over the Mediterranean, resulting in the downing of two Libyan fighter jets. The Libyan government has lodged a complaint against the U.S. over the incident and demanded an emergency meeting of the United Nations Security Council for discussion. This event has further strained already tense U.S.-Libyan relations, drawing significant attention from the international community.

Tensions between the U.S. and Libya have a long history. As early as 1969, when King Idris of Libya was overthrown and Libyan leader Muammar Gaddafi ordered the closure of U.S. military bases in Libya, fissures began to appear between the two countries.

In 1980, the U.S. closed its embassy in Libya in response to the burning of the U.S. embassy there and subsequently ordered Libyan diplomats to leave the country, leading to a severance of relations. Since then, the two countries have engaged in multiple military confrontations in the Mediterranean, resulting in damage to Libyan aircraft and warships. Gaddafi vowed to "eliminate our enemies wherever they are." The U.S., meanwhile, accused Libya of being a supporter of international terrorism, placing it on the "hostile nations" list. Additionally, the U.S. imposed a series of sanctions on Libya, including freezing all Libyan assets in the U.S., halting all economic activities between the two countries, withdrawing all U.S. personnel from Libya, and demanding that Western allies take similar actions. On April 15, 1986, the U.S. bombed the Libyan capital, citing Libya's support for international terrorism. Gaddafi responded by vowing to retaliate with "an eye for an eye." U.S.-Libyan relations reached a state of extreme tension.

With the easing of international tensions, U.S.-Libyan relations began to show signs of change starting in 1987. Libyan leader Muammar Gaddafi repeatedly expressed his desire to improve relations with the U.S. and establish a new relationship where "we live and let others live." Low-level contacts between the U.S. and Libya resumed, and trade between the two countries began to restart. However, due to the U.S. government's insistence on requiring concrete and sustained evidence of Libya's change in policy towards terrorism, U.S.-Libyan relations did not truly thaw.

Last September, the U.S. State Department announced that it had intelligence indicating Libya's capability to produce large quantities of chemical weapons prohibited by the Geneva Convention. Since then, U.S.-Libyan relations have again tightened. Libya has repeatedly denied these allegations and expressed its willingness to accept international inspections of its chemical plants and comply with all regulations prohibiting the use of chemical weapons. U.S. government officials, however, have repeatedly stated that the U.S. is in contact with its allies, considering military action against Libya. Therefore, some observers believe that the U.S. downing of Libyan aircraft is related to these developments.

Currently, the international situation is shifting from confrontation to dialogue, and the situations in global hotspots have improved to varying degrees. The U.S.-Libyan confrontation runs counter to the current global trend. The U.S.'s action of shooting down Libyan fighter jets is regrettable. It is hoped that both the U.S. and Libya will adopt a restrained attitude, resolve their disputes through dialogue, and avoid resorting to force.

　　令人不安的美利军事冲突
    安国章
    本月４日，美国和利比亚飞机在地中海上空发生冲突，两架利比亚战斗机被击落；利比亚政府已就此事对美国提出指控，并要求联合国安理会举行紧急会议进行讨论。这一事件使本来就不和的美利关系再度恶化，引起国际社会的极大关注。
    美利关系的紧张由来已久。早在１９６９年，当利比亚伊德里斯国王被推翻、利比亚领导人卡扎菲下令关闭美国在利比亚的军事基地后，两国之间的裂痕就开始出现。
    １９８０年，美国以其驻利比亚使馆被烧为由关闭了使馆，随后又令利比亚外交官离美，美利关系中断。其后，两国又多次在地中海发生军事对抗，利比亚飞机和军舰遭到损失。卡扎菲发誓要“消灭我们任何地方的敌人”。美国则指责利比亚是国际恐怖活动的支持者之一，将其列入“敌视国”的名单中。此外，美国还对利比亚采取了一系列诸如冻结利比亚在美国的一切资产、中止美利之间的全部经济活动、撤出美国在利比亚的一切人员等制裁措施，并要求西欧盟国也采取相应行动。１９８６年４月１５日美国以利比亚支持国际恐怖活动为由，对利比亚首都进行大规模轰炸。卡扎菲表示，对美国的行动要采取“以其人之道还治其人之身”的报复行动。美利关系曾呈现剑拔弩张的状态。
    随着国际形势的缓和，从１９８７年以来，美利关系也出现新的变化。利比亚领导人卡扎菲曾多次表示希望改善两国关系，愿同美国建立一种“自己活也让别人活”的新关系。利美之间出现了低级别的接触，双方的贸易也开始进行。但由于美国政府坚持要“有证据表明利比亚支持恐怖主义的政策发生具体而持久的变化”才予以理睬的立场等原因，美利关系没有出现真正的解冻。
    去年９月，美国国务院宣布，它掌握了利比亚有能力大量生产日内瓦公约禁止的化学武器的情报。从此，美利关系又趋紧张。利比亚一再否认，并表示准备接受国际上对其化学工厂的核查，遵守一切禁止使用化学武器的规定。美国政府领导人则多次发表讲话说，美国正与盟国进行接触，考虑对利比亚采取军事行动。因此，有舆论认为，美国击落利比亚飞机一举，显然有上述背景。
    当前，国际形势正从对抗转向对话，世界热点地区的局势都有不同程度的好转。美利对抗同当今世界潮流相悖。美国击落利比亚战斗机的作法是令人遗憾的。人们希望美、利双方都能采取克制态度，通过对话解决彼此争端，而不是诉诸武力。
