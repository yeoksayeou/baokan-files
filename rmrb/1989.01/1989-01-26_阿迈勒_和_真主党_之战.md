The Battle Between "Amal" and "Hezbollah"

Reporter Wu Wenbin

At the start of the new year, the Amal Movement and Hezbollah, both belonging to the Shia Muslim sect, engaged in large-scale armed clashes in southern Lebanon. The fighting continues to this day.

Last April, the Amal Movement, which is pro-Syria, and Hezbollah, which is pro-Iran, clashed in southern Lebanon. As a result, Hezbollah's forces were driven out of most of southern Lebanon by the Amal Movement. Subsequently, the two sides clashed in the southern suburbs of Beirut, and the fighting only ended when Syrian troops moved into the area.

Although both the Amal Movement and Hezbollah belong to the Shia Muslim sect, their differences have been longstanding. Hezbollah rejects UN Security Council Resolution 420, insisting on abolishing Lebanon's current political system and striving to establish an Islamic republic in Lebanon. They also accuse Amal of collaborating with Israel to stop military actions against Israel in exchange for Israel's withdrawal from the "security" areas on the border. The Amal Movement, on the other hand, supports UN Security Council Resolution 420, advocates for the deployment of international peacekeeping forces in southern Lebanon, rejects the idea of an Islamic republic, and accuses Hezbollah of extremist religious and terrorist activities in Lebanon. The antagonism between the two sides has been escalating, leading to frequent bloody incidents.

Hezbollah, unwilling to accept their defeat in southern Lebanon last year, regrouped and launched a fierce attack on the Amal Movement's occupied areas in the Tufeil region of southern Lebanon on January 7th. They initially captured five villages. Subsequently, the Amal Movement mobilized over 1,000 militiamen to counterattack. Currently, the two sides are still engaged in fierce fighting, with neither side gaining the upper hand. It is reported that in the past three weeks of fighting, over 150 people have been killed, more than 200 injured, dozens captured or missing, and over 20,000 civilians displaced. This conflict has brought new disasters to the Lebanese people, who have already suffered greatly from the war.

The Tufeil region, which is the focus of the conflict, is located between the southern suburbs of Beirut and the Lebanon-Israel border, making it strategically important. The escalation of the conflict between the two sides not only threatens the security of this region but also risks escalating tensions along the Lebanon-Israel border. Therefore, relevant parties have been actively involved in mediation. Iran's Deputy Foreign Minister Bisharat arrived in Damascus on January 10th with a letter from Iran's President to Syria's President, discussing ways to resolve the bloody conflict and hoping that Syrian troops would intervene. Meanwhile, Mohammad Rafsanjani, the brother of Iran's Speaker of Parliament Rafsanjani, also traveled to Beirut to meet with Shia leaders in Lebanon to discuss ceasefire plans. The Deputy Chairman of the Supreme Council of Islamic Shia in Lebanon, after visiting Tehran, returned to Lebanon with instructions from Khomeini, urging both warring parties to cease fire immediately. However, the Amal Movement rejected Iran's mediation, stating that they would continue fighting until Hezbollah's forces were completely expelled from the region. Amal leader Atif accused Iran of supporting Hezbollah and attempting to expand its influence in southern Lebanon to gain leverage in negotiations with the United States. He declared that Amal would not allow Iran to interfere in Lebanon's internal affairs. Iran's "World News" newspaper, in turn, accused Syria of standing by while the two factions in Lebanon clashed. Iran's "News" newspaper stated that Syria provided weapons and equipment to the Amal Movement with the aim of weakening Hezbollah's influence. The escalating propaganda war and the continuing armed conflict have made it difficult for Iran and Syria to mediate effectively.

To quickly end the conflict between the two factions and prevent damage to Syrian-Iranian relations, Iran's Foreign Minister Velayati arrived in Damascus on January 22nd. He will deliver a letter from Iran's President to Syria's President and further discuss the latest developments in the region, particularly the situation in Lebanon, with Syrian leaders. Lebanon's Amal Movement Chairman Berri and Hezbollah leaders, as well as the Deputy Chairman of the Supreme Council of Islamic Shia, also arrived in Damascus that evening. Amal officials said that Berri brought a proposal to resolve the conflict. Other faction leaders also expressed their hope that the upcoming joint meeting between Syria and Iran with the Amal Movement and Hezbollah would achieve positive results and promote unity among Lebanese Muslims. A senior Syrian official said that a four-party mediation committee would be formed to seek a solution acceptable to all parties.

### “阿迈勒”和“真主党”之战

　　“阿迈勒”和“真主党”之战
    本报记者  吴文斌
    新年伊始，同属穆斯林什叶派的阿迈勒运动和真主党再次在黎巴嫩南部发生大规模武装冲突，迄今双方仍在继续战斗。
    去年４月，亲叙利亚的阿迈勒运动民兵和亲伊朗的真主党民兵曾在黎南部发生流血冲突。结果，真主党武装被阿迈勒运动从黎南部大部分地区赶出，继而双方又在贝鲁特南郊发生血战，直到叙利亚军队进驻南郊才结束了那场战斗。
    阿迈勒运动和真主党虽同属穆斯林什叶派，但双方的分歧却由来已久。真主党拒不承认安理会４２０号决议，坚持废除黎巴嫩现行政治制度，致力于在黎建立一个伊斯兰共和国，并指责阿迈勒与以色列合作，以停止对以的军事行动换取以色列从边界的“安全”地区撤军。阿迈勒运动则坚持安理会４２０号决议，主张在黎南部驻扎国际和平部队，拒绝伊斯兰共和国的思想，并指控真主党在黎搞极端宗教和恐怖活动。双方的对立情绪日益严重，不断发生流血事件。
    真主党不甘心去年在黎南部的失败，重新集结力量后，于本月７日向黎南部图法赫地区阿迈勒民兵占领区发起猛烈攻击，一度占领其中５个村镇。随后，阿迈勒运动调集了１０００多名民兵发起反攻。目前，双方仍激烈争夺，相持不下。据透露，在近３个星期的战斗中，双方有１５０多人死亡，２００多人受伤，数十人被捕或失踪，２万多平民流离失所。这场冲突给饱经战乱之苦的黎巴嫩人民带来了新的灾难。
    双方争夺的图法赫地区处于贝鲁特南郊和黎以边界的中间地带，战略地位十分重要。双方冲突的升级不仅威胁这一地区的安全，还将导致黎以边界局势紧张。因此，有关各方活动频繁，积极进行调解。伊朗副外长比沙拉提１０日携带伊朗总统致叙利亚总统的信件抵大马士革，与叙利亚领导人协商解决流血冲突的途径，并希望叙军进行干预。与此同时，伊朗议长拉夫桑贾尼的兄弟穆罕默德·拉夫桑贾尼也奔赴贝鲁特与黎什叶派领导人会晤，研讨停火方案。伊斯兰什叶派最高委员会副主席在访问德黑兰后，带着霍梅尼的指示返黎，要求交战双方立即停火。然而，阿迈勒运动拒绝伊朗的调解，声明要继续战斗到将真主党势力从该地区彻底清除为止。阿迈勒领导人阿提夫指责伊朗支持真主党，企图在黎南部扩大势力以增加其与美国谈判的筹码。他宣布阿迈勒不允许伊朗干涉黎内部事务。伊朗的《世界报》则指责叙利亚对黎两派冲突袖手旁观。伊朗《消息报》说叙利亚向阿迈勒运动提供武器装备，旨在削弱真主党势力。措辞激烈的宣传战和流血冲突的继续升级，使伊朗和叙利亚等方面的调解未能奏效。
    为尽快结束两派争端和避免叙伊关系受损，伊朗外长韦拉亚提２２日抵大马士革。他将向叙利亚总统转交伊朗总统的信件，并与叙领导人就本地区形势特别是黎巴嫩局势最新发展进一步磋商。黎巴嫩阿迈勒运动主席贝里和真主党领导人以及伊斯兰什叶派最高委员会副主席也于当晚分别抵达大马士革。阿迈勒运动官员说，贝里带来了一份解决冲突的方案。其它各派领导人也表示，他们希望叙利亚和伊朗与阿迈勒运动和真主党即将举行的联合会议取得积极结果，实现黎巴嫩穆斯林的团结。叙利亚高级官员说，即将组成一个四方调解委员会，以寻求一个能为各方接受的解决方案。
