Students and faculty from two universities in Wuhan refute Western distortions

A student says, a small incident was exaggerated to be a big deal

Xinhua News Agency, Wuhan, January 7th - (Reporter Luo Hui) An incident reported by some foreign news agencies, in which a Sri Lankan student named Rohit was allegedly beaten by Chinese students, was refuted by Rohit himself on the 6th. He told reporters that the incident fabricated by the Associated Press reporter John Pomfret never happened, and he had never gone to the hospital for treatment.

The 29-year-old Rohit, after a 6-day tour of the famous Xiaosanxia and Gezhouba, returned to Huazhong University of Science and Technology on the evening of the 5th. He said that on the night of December 29th at 11 PM, he was lying in bed preparing to sleep when a stone the size of an egg suddenly broke through the window glass from outside. He got up and accidentally cut his right hand on the broken glass. He went to the school clinic for a dressing and that was it. The whole incident was just that. On December 31st, he and 21 other foreign students from 10 countries, including all 8 African students studying at this key Chinese university, went on a tour to Gezhouba and other places. He added, "The stone might have been thrown by someone outside the school because it is very easy for outsiders to enter and leave the school."

Rohit enrolled in this university in September last year. Smiling, he told the reporter that the foreign students here are currently living in peace, busy reviewing and preparing for exams. He wants to call the Sri Lankan Embassy in China to tell them that he feels no fear in China and gets along very well with Chinese students and teachers. Living here is like being on his own soil.

When Rohit was introducing the situation to the reporter, a Bangladeshi student named Omar also gestured with both hands, saying, "Originally, the incident here was only as big as an egg, but in some reports, it became as big as a water buffalo."

A Zambian student, Mulenga, pointing to his eyes, said, "If I hadn't seen it with my own eyes, I might have believed that the reports from foreign news agencies were true."

An official from Huazhong University of Science and Technology said, "We have not had any incidents like the ones reported by the Associated Press, where Chinese students marched and beat foreign students. Such distorted and fabricated reports violate the principle of news truthfulness and basic news ethics."

The president of Wuhan University of Chemical Technology, Chen Gusheng, told the reporter, "The report says that students from Wuhan University of Chemical Technology beat a Sri Lankan student. I feel very sorry, but Wuhan University of Chemical Technology does not have any foreign students."

Another official from the university said, "The report by Agence France-Presse is completely fabricated and the facts should be clarified as soon as possible."

　　武汉两高校师生驳西方歪曲报道
    一留学生说，蛋大的事渲染得大如牛
    新华社武汉１月７日电  （记者罗辉）被有些外国新闻机构连日报道的所谓遭到中国学生殴打的斯里兰卡留学生罗黑德６日告诉记者，根本不存在美联社记者约翰·庞弗雷特所捏造的他遭到殴打的事，他也从来没有去医院接受治疗。
    今年２９岁的罗黑德在去著名的小三峡和葛洲坝进行６天的旅游参观之后，于５日晚上回到他正在学习的武汉华中理工大学。他说，去年１２月２９日夜里１１时，他躺在床上正准备入睡，窗户玻璃突然被外面飞进的一块鸡蛋大的石头打破，他起床时右手不小心按在碎玻璃上，当时到校医务室包扎了一下就没事了，整个事情的经过就是这样。１２月３１日，他和该校来自１０个国家的２１名留学生，其中包括在这所中国重点大学学习的全部共８名非洲留学生一起去葛洲坝等地旅游。他又说：“这块石头可能是学校外面的人扔的，因为外面的人进出他所在的学校非常方便。”
    罗黑德是去年９月进入这所大学学习的。他微笑着告诉记者，这里的外国留学生目前生活安稳，正在忙着复习，准备考试。他要给斯里兰卡驻华使馆打长途电话，告诉他们：他在中国根本没有害怕的感觉，而且和中国学生和老师相处得非常友好，生活在这里就像在自己的国土上一样。
    当罗黑德向记者介绍情况时，一名叫奥马尔的孟加拉留学生也用双手比划着说，“本来这儿的事情只有鸡蛋大，可是到了一些报道中，事情却变成了水牛大。”
    赞比亚留学生穆兰嘎指着自己的眼睛说：“如果不是亲眼所见，那我有可能相信外国通讯社的报道是真实的。”
    华中理工大学负责人说，我们这里并没有发生过像美联社报道的中国学生游行、殴打外国留学生的事，这种歪曲事实甚至无中生有的报道违背了新闻必须真实的原则和起码的新闻道德。
    武汉化工学院院长陈古圣对记者说：“这篇报道说，武汉化工学院学生打伤了一名斯里兰卡留学生，我感到很遗憾，武汉化工学院没有一个外国留学生。”
    这所学院的另一名负责人说：“法新社的那篇报道完全是捏造，应尽快澄清事实真相。”
