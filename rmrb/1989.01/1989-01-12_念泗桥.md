	For many years
	For many a lover
	They have wandered through the labyrinthine alleys
	Twisting and turning in search
	Searching for you—
	To confirm a fairy tale of a jade maiden playing the flute
	And so, you stand still
	Frozen into a segment
	Of history where the spring breeze sweeps ten miles and ends in the south of the river
	Only the flowing water, only the flute
	Unconcerned with the puzzled and doubtful gaze
	Still flowing day and night, still playing day and night…
	In truth, why must people
	Search and search again, again and again
	Isn't there a bright moon at the bridgehead?
	The jade flowers by the bridge are also blooming
	The morning light is soft, a colorful ancient city
	Spinning in the melody of the flute.

　　念泗桥
    刘春阳
    多少年
    多少个痴情者
    沿着谜一般的小巷
    弯弯曲曲地寻找
    寻找你——
    为了证实一则玉人吹箫的童话
    于是，你凝固了
    凝固成一段
    春风十里又尽江南的历史
    唯有流水，唯有洞箫
    无暇顾盼疑惑的眼神
    依旧日日地流，夜夜地吹……
    其实，人们又何必
    反反复复，复复反反地寻觅
    桥头不是二分明月吗
    桥畔的琼花也正在吐香
    晨光熹微，一个多彩的古城
    旋转在洞箫的音律里
