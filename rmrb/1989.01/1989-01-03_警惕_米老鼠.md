Beware of the "Rice Rats"

"The great rat, the great rat, do not eat my millet!" The poem "The Great Rat" from the Book of Songs expresses the contempt of the working people for rats in both the natural world and human society. Unfortunately, the rats that steal grain have persisted for thousands of years and are still gnawing at the granaries today. Today, we must especially beware of those who exploit the price difference in grain rationing to resell urban residents' grain rations and seek private gains, the "rice rats."

Food is the foundation of people's lives. Grain is the basic living resource that humans rely on to survive. Since 1985, China's grain production has stagnated for four consecutive years. Meanwhile, the population has been growing. With more people and less food, this has become a serious practical problem that hinders economic development and reform.

At a time when grain production is facing temporary difficulties, what are the people thinking? This can be roughly divided into two categories: As grain producers, farmers hope that grain prices will rise in a timely manner to change the situation where prices are too low, stimulating enthusiasm for grain production; as grain consumers, urban residents hope to maintain stable grain prices to ensure basic living stability.

Undoubtedly, this is a contradiction. Simply completely liberalizing grain prices and canceling the subsidized supply of grain to urban residents may lead to social instability, as the inflation rate has been too high in recent years. On the other hand, completely returning to the old path and not allowing free pricing of grain will definitely dampen farmers' enthusiasm for grain production. The Party and the government, considering the complexity of the contradiction, have decided to implement a "dual-track" pricing system for grain.

The "dual-track" system will continue to exist for a considerable period in the future. It is worth noting that the gap between the "dual tracks" will become a stage for speculators. In recent periods, there have been reports from many cities of individual employees of state-run grain shops stealing grain. For example, the manager Li Guangxin, who stole subsidized grain from the state granary with one hand and sold it at a high price to grain dealers with the other hand, is a case in point. Recently, residents of a certain city in northern China wrote to this newspaper about such incidents, saying that they could not buy grain in the state-run grain shop near their homes, and people had to go to the market to buy grain at high prices. Rumors spread that "grain coupons will be abolished, and grain prices will skyrocket," causing public anxiety. Some residents even complained: "Reform has gone awry."

It seems that the "rat problem" has reached people's "mouths," and it cannot be ignored. Severely punishing speculators who exploit the gaps in the "dual-track" system is to protect the interests of the people and to ensure the smooth progress of reform.

### 警惕“米老鼠”

　　警惕“米老鼠”
    “硕鼠硕鼠，无食我黍！”诗经《硕鼠》篇道出了劳动人民对于生物界和人类社会中鼠类的鄙视。不幸的是，窃鼠历千年而不灭，直到今天还在粮仓中啮食。今天，我们须特别警惕利用粮食平议差价，倒卖城市居民口粮，牟取私利的“米老鼠”。
    民以食为天。粮食是人类赖以生存的基本生活资料。自１９８５年以来，我国已连续四年粮食生产徘徊不前。与此同时，人口却在不断增长。人多食少，成为困扰经济发展和改革大业的严重现实问题。
    在粮食生产暂时遇到困难的当口，群众在想什么？大约可以粗分为二：作为粮食生产者的农民，盼着粮价及时上浮，以改变比价偏低的现状，刺激种粮积极性；作为粮食消费者的市民，则希望保持口粮价格不动，以保证生活的基本稳定。
    无疑这是一对矛盾。简单地全然放开粮价，取消对市民口粮的平价供应，社会可能难以安定，因为几年来通货膨胀率已经过高。相反，统统退回老路，全部不许粮食自由定价，定会挫伤农民种粮热情。党和政府正是考虑了矛盾的复杂性，才决定实行粮价“双轨制”。
    “双轨制”在今后相当长时期内还将存在下去。值得注意的是，“双轨”之间的地带会成为“倒爷”们的舞台。最近一个阶段，从不少城市传来国营粮店个别职工监守自盗的消息。像李广新这样的经理，一手挖国家粮库中的平价口粮，一手高价卖给粮贩子，坐收渔利，就是一例。不久前，北方某城市的群众就此类事件致信本报，说在他们居家附近的国营粮店中竟买不到口粮，人们不得不去集市高价果腹，纷纷传言“粮票将作废，粮价要大涨”，一时搅得人心惶惶，有些群众甚至因此发牢骚：“改革乱了套”。
    看来，“鼠患”已经闹到人们的“嘴边”了，不可不治。严厉惩处钻“双轨制”空档的倒爷们，为的是维护群众利益，也为的是保障改革顺利进行。
