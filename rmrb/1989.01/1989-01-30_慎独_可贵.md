Title: The Value of "Cultivating Solitude"

The "Book of Rites" in the "Doctrine of the Mean" states, “That which is hidden cannot be seen, that which is subtle cannot be displayed. Therefore, a gentleman is cautious when he is alone.” This means that one should not assume that no one is watching or that small matters are insignificant, and thus relax one's self-discipline. A person of high moral character should always adhere to moral principles in any situation, even when alone.

It is recorded that during the Ming Dynasty, Li Tan once went to Fujian to oversee the imperial examinations. He held significant power, and many people sought his favor. One night, an examinee sent Li Tan a large bag of gold, hoping for special treatment.

Li Tan angrily rejected the bribe and drove the briber out with a stern voice. He immediately wrote a poem to express his resolve, which reads: “The source of righteousness and profit is clearly understood, gold cannot buy the poverty of a decayed scholar, do not say that in the night there is no one who knows, fear that the heavens and earth have spirits.” Whether Li Tan's poetry is good or not is not the point; his spirit of "cultivating solitude" is indeed rare and precious.

In the book "On the Cultivation of Communist Party Members" by Liu Shaoqi, it is required that every Communist Party member "even when working independently, without supervision, and having the opportunity to do various bad things, can 'cultivate solitude' and not do any bad things." Throughout history, how many sages and wise men have used their bright virtues and high moral standards to set examples for us!

However, there are some comrades around us who can maintain integrity and self-discipline in public and under the scrutiny of others. But once they are "working independently, without supervision," the situation changes: there are those who forget righteousness for profit; there are also those who forget the law for profit. They think their actions are secret and unknown to others, forgetting the saying, "If you want no one to know, you must not do it yourself." Moreover, the more the greedy reach out, the more their tails will be exposed, ultimately ruining themselves. It is hoped that every state official will uphold the spirit of "cultivating solitude" and serve the people well.

### “慎独”可贵

　　“慎独”可贵
    李克
    《礼记·中庸》篇云，“莫见乎隐，莫显乎微，故君子慎其独也。”意思是，不要以为没人看见，不要以为事情很细小，便放松对自己的要求。一个品行高尚的人在任何情况下，即使是独处时也不忘用道德准则来规范自己的行为。
    史载，明人李汰有一次去福建主持科举考试。他重权在手，所求者甚多。有一考生夜间给李汰送来一大包黄金，以期关照。
    李汰愤然拒贿，并将行贿考生“厉声驱出”，当即赋诗一首以明心志，诗曰：“义利源头识颇真，黄金难买腐儒贫，莫言暮夜无知者，怕塞乾坤有鬼神。”李汰诗艺如何暂且不说，其“慎独”精神堪称难能可贵。
    刘少奇同志在《论共产党员的修养》一书中，要求每个中共党员“即使在他个人独立工作、无人监督、有做各种坏事的可能的时候，他能够‘慎独’，不做任何坏事。”古往今来，多少先圣贤哲用自己的亮节高风，为我们树立了楷模。
    可是，我们周围有那样的一些同志，在大庭广众之中，在众目睽睽之下，尚能做到清正廉明，洁身自好，倘若一旦“独立工作，无人监督”，情况就不一样了：见利忘义者有之；见利忘法的也有。他们自以为行为诡谲，无人知晓，忘了“要想人不知，除非己莫为”的警言。更何况，贪者手伸得越长，尾巴则越显露，最终难免毁了自己。但愿每一个国家公务人员，都弘扬“慎独”精神，当好人民的公仆。
