On the morning of December 2, 1988, a prison van drove into the People's Court of Zhangzhou City's Xuancheng District, Fujian Province. Liu Shìzhōng, who should have been sitting in the prosecutor's seat, now stood dejectedly in the defendant's dock.

Liu Shìzhōng had served as the deputy section chief of the Forestry Prosecution Section of the Zhangzhou City People's Procuratorate. While handling a major fraud case in Fujian Province, following the Du Guózhēng case, he blatantly disregarded national laws and voraciously embezzled illicit funds and goods. In March 1986, during the seizure of the illicit goods from the "Fujian Branch" of the fraudster Gao Wèibāng, Liu Shìzhōng concealed the fact that Qīnglóng County Building Materials Factory in Guizhou had supplied 509.47 square meters of marble to the "Fujian Branch" and did not report it. He secretly colluded with Wáng Jiāmǐn to sell 438.62 square meters of the seized goods to the Zhangzhou City Sports Commission and the Longhai County Materials Recovery Company, earning nearly 16,000 yuan. To cover his tracks, Liu Shìzhōng instructed Wáng Jiāmǐn to fabricate a fake receipt for the purchase, submitting it to Qīnglóng County Building Materials Factory for accounting, and embezzled 8,409 yuan from the process. Liu Shìzhōng received 2,430 yuan of the illicit funds.

In June 1986, Liu Shìzhōng discovered from the materials that Xiao and Chen from the Longhai County Nanxing Trade Company had received 8,000 yuan in contract breach compensation from Gao Wèibāng during the signing of a steel materials business contract. During the investigation, Liu Shìzhōng attempted to extort money but failed, so he threatened the parties involved: "If you don't return the money, I'll have you arrested!" Xiao and Chen had no choice but to give Liu Shìzhōng 3,000 yuan in cash, along with an additional 400 yuan in "red envelopes," and one pound each of squid and mushrooms. When Liu Shìzhōng returned the 3,000 yuan to Xiao and Chen, he said, "My family is in financial difficulty, and my mother-in-law is in the hospital..." Xiao and Chen understood Liu Shìzhōng's intentions and had to give him another 1,000 yuan.

From March 1986 to July 1987, Liu Shìzhōng embezzled over 1,300 yuan in public funds, embezzled over 6,800 yuan while handling the Gao Wèibāng fraud case, extorted 3,200 yuan and other items. Additionally, Liu Shìzhōng abused his authority to rape a woman.

Recently, the Zhangzhou Intermediate People's Court sentenced Liu Shìzhōng to 11 years in prison for the crimes of rape, embezzlement, and extortion. This former "prosecutor" has become today's "prisoner." Shouldn't this serve as a warning to officials in state organs?

　　昔日“检察官”今日“阶下囚”
    １９８８年１２月２日上午，一辆囚车驶进福建省漳州市芗城区人民法院。刘世忠——这个本应坐在公诉人席上的检察员，此时却垂头丧气地站在被告席上。
    刘世忠曾任漳州市人民检察院林检科副科长。在负责经办福建省继杜国桢之后的又一起特大诈骗案中，竟然无视国家法律，疯狂吞噬赃款赃物。１９８６年３月，在查封诈骗犯高卫邦“驻闽公司”赃物过程中，刘世忠隐瞒了由贵州晴隆县建材厂向“驻闽公司”提供大理石５０９．４７平方米不报，暗中勾结王家敏将归案赃物擅自出售给漳州市体委和龙海县物资回收公司４３８．６２平方米，得款人民币近１．６万元。为了掩人耳目，事后刘世忠指使王家敏搞一张买货的假证明，向晴隆县建材厂报帐，从中贪污人民币８４０９多元，刘世忠得赃款２４３０元。
    １９８６年６月，刘世忠从材料中发现龙海县南兴贸易公司肖某和陈某在与高卫邦签订钢材业务合同中，曾收高卫邦合同违约金８０００元。在调查过程中，刘世忠用暗示手法索钱款不成，就恐吓当事人：“不退款，就抓人！”肖某和陈某无奈，只得给刘世忠人民币３０００元，另给“红包”４００元，鱿鱼及香菇各一斤。刘世忠将３０００元退还肖某和陈某时说：“我家里经济紧张，岳母住院……”肖、陈明白刘世忠的用意，不得不再拿出人民币１０００元给他。
    从１９８６年３月至１９８７年７月，刘世忠冒领公款１３００多元，在经办高卫邦诈骗案中贪污６８００多元，敲诈勒索３２００元及其他物品。此外，刘世忠还利用职权强奸一名妇女。
    漳州市中级人民法院最近以犯强奸、贪污、敲诈勒索罪判处刘世忠有期徒刑１１年。这位昔日的“检察官”，成了今日的“阶下囚”。这不是很该引起国家机关工作人员的警觉么？
