A cruise missile was launched on the 27th from a U.S. B-52 bomber over the Beaufort Sea and successfully hit a target in northeastern Alberta, Canada, several hours later.

This was the ninth such test conducted on Canadian territory since 1985. A Canadian military spokesperson stated that the simulated air-to-air missile destruction test was very successful.

The test, originally scheduled for the 24th, was postponed twice due to poor weather conditions.

　　美加合作进行巡航导弹试验
    一枚巡航导弹二十七日由一架美国Ｂ—５２型轰炸机在波弗特海上空发射，数小时后击中设在加拿大东北部艾伯塔省的一个目标。
    这是一九八五年来第九次在加拿大领土上进行类似试验。加拿大军方一位发言人说，这次模拟空中摧毁导弹的试验进行得很成功。
    原定于二十四日进行，后因天气不好两次推迟了试验。
