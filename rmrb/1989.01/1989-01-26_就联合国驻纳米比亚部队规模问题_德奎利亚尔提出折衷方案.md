The United Nations Secretary-General, Perez de Cuellar, has proposed a compromise on the size of the United Nations Transition Assistance Group in Namibia to resolve the dispute over whether to reduce the number of military personnel in the group.

A UN spokesman said today that the Secretary-General's proposal has been distributed to the representatives of the Security Council member states, and discussions on this issue may take place this weekend.

According to the proposal, the number of military personnel in the UN assistance group will be reduced from the 7,500 stipulated in Security Council Resolution 435 to 4,650, with the required funds reduced from $640 million to $400 million. However, if it is found during the actual implementation that the personnel are insufficient, the Secretary-General can dispatch additional troops as needed.

The Security Council adopted Resolution 435 in 1978, requiring the UN assistance group to stay in Namibia for one year to supervise its free elections and achieve independence from South African rule. The funds required are to be provided from sources outside the UN's regular budget. The permanent members of the Security Council, considering the need to save funds, have demanded a reduction in the number of military personnel, while the non-aligned countries, distrustful of South Africa's sincerity in fulfilling its international obligations, have insisted on maintaining the original number.

　　就联合国驻纳米比亚部队规模问题    
    德奎利亚尔提出折衷方案
    新华社联合国１月２４日电  联合国秘书长佩雷斯·德奎利亚尔就联合国驻纳米比亚过渡时期援助团的规模提出了一项折衷建议，以平息围绕是否削减援助团军事人员人数引起的争论。
    联合国发言人今天说，秘书长的这份建议已经分发给安理会各成员国代表，本周末可能将就这一问题进行讨论。
    根据这项建议，联合国援助团中的军事人员将从安理会４３５号决议规定的７５００人减少到４６５０人，所需经费由６．４亿美元减少到４亿美元；但如果实际执行过程中证明人员不足，秘书长可以根据需要增派部队。
    安理会１９７８年通过的４３５号决议要求联合国援助团驻纳１年，以监督其自由选举进而实现从南非统治下独立；所需经费由联合国日常预算之外的来源提供。安理会常务理事国出于节省经费的考虑，要求减少其中的军事人员，而不结盟国家则不相信南非有诚意履行国际义务，要求维持原额。
