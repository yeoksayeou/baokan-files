The cultural and entertainment industry in Fuzhou is thriving, with dance halls and tea houses scattered throughout the streets.

According to the Xinhua News Agency in Fuzhou on January 22 (reporter Jing Yan), the cultural consumption needs of Fuzhou residents are increasing. Traditional cultural activities such as films, theater, and folk arts can no longer meet the demand. Various commercial cultural and entertainment industries and service outlets have emerged in response.

According to incomplete statistics, since 1986, the city has opened 46 commercial dance halls and music tea houses, 47 folk professional theater troupes, 203 video screening points, 12 book and magazine rental points, 15 professional amusement parks and cultural centers, and over 400 electronic game and billiard rooms. These entertainment businesses and service outlets are like stars scattered throughout the streets and alleys. In terms of ownership, there are state-owned, collective, and individual enterprises, as well as joint ventures with foreign partners.
