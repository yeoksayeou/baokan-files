	Unfulfilled Contractual Tax and Profit Obligations
	22 Beijing Enterprises Face Debt Repayment
	Beijing, January 24 (Xinhua) — Reporter Zhang Shuzheng reports: Starting today, 22 industrial enterprises in Beijing, including Beijing Machine Tool Gear Factory and Beijing Fourth Switch Factory, which failed to meet their contractual tax and profit obligations, will repay their debts through five methods using their own enterprise funds.

	Last year, 433 state-owned industrial enterprises in Beijing implemented the contract responsibility system, with a total contractual tax and profit obligation of 11.552 billion yuan (excluding Shougang, hereinafter the same). The actual completion amounted to 13.07 billion yuan, exceeding the target by 1.45 billion yuan. However, 22 enterprises (accounting for 5% of the total) failed to meet their contractual tax and profit obligations due to poor management and rising raw material prices, among other reasons. They collectively owe 29.026 million yuan in unpaid taxes and profits. To uphold the seriousness of the contract and the principle of clear rewards and punishments, these 22 enterprises that failed to meet their contractual tax and profit obligations will start repaying their debts today.

	They will repay their debts through the following five methods:
	(1) Fully repay the outstanding amount using the enterprise's own funds.
	(2) If the outstanding amount has already been partially repaid using the enterprise's own funds, the remaining amount will be repaid with interest, and the municipal risk fund committee will lend the risk fund to cover the rest.
	(3) The debt-ridden enterprise will pay interest, and other enterprises will lend their own funds to cover the rest.
	(4) For enterprises that have failed to meet their contractual obligations for two consecutive years, have products with no development prospects, and are in extreme difficulty, they will undergo re-bidding for contracts or be merged and acquired. The outstanding amount will be repaid by the acquiring enterprise or the new contractor.
	(5) For enterprises whose main reason for not meeting their contractual tax and profit obligations is due to a sharp increase in raw material prices while producing in-demand products, the outstanding amount will be temporarily suspended, deferred, and repaid, but tax reductions and concessions will not be granted.

	For the 14 enterprises whose total tax and profit amount has decreased compared to the previous year, wages must be reduced according to the contract terms.

	The debt repayment practice of these 22 Beijing enterprises is a beneficial exploration for industrial enterprises to implement the contract responsibility system, adhering to the principle of "both profiting and losing."

### 未完成承包上交税利任务  北京２２家企业负亏还债

　　未完成承包上交税利任务
    北京２２家企业负亏还债
    本报北京１月２４日讯  记者张书政报道：北京未完成承包上交税利的北京机床齿轮厂、北京第四开关厂等２２户工业企业，今日起通过用企业自有资金补足等５种形式，负亏还债，兑现承包合同。
    北京去年实行承包经营责任制的４３３户国营工业企业，承包上交税利总金额１１５．５２亿元（不含首钢，下同），实际完成１３０．７亿元，超交１．４５亿元。但是，其中有２２户（占总户数的５％）由于经营管理不善和原材料涨价等种种原因，没有完成承包的上交税利指标，共计欠交税利金额２９０２．６万元。为严肃承包合同，履行奖罚分明的初衷，２２户未完成承包上交税利的企业今起负亏还债。
    他们是通过如下５种形式负亏还债的：（１）欠交额全部用企业自有资金补足。（２）已用自有资金补交，不足部分交付利息，向市风险基金委员会借风险基金补足。（３）由负亏企业交付利息，借其他企业自有资金补足。（４）连续两年未完成承包任务，产品没有发展前途，经营极为困难的企业，重新招标承包或进行合并、兼并，其欠交额由兼并企业或新承包者代为补交。（５）未完成承包上交税利的主要原因是由于原材料价格暴涨而又生产紧俏产品的企业，欠交额暂挂账，缓交、补交，但决不减税让利。
    对于实现税利总额比上年下降的１４户企业，按承包合同规定，工资必须下浮。
    北京２２户企业的负亏实践，对工业企业实行承包经营，“坚持既负盈也一定要负亏”的原则，是有益的探索。
