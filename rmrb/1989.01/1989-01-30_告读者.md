The literary section of this newspaper and the Yancity Radio Factory have jointly organized the "Yanwu Essay Contest," which has now concluded.

This contest lasted for over five months and received more than fifteen thousand entries from all over the country. Due to space limitations, some excellent works could not be published. We apologize to the authors.

The contest is now in the award evaluation stage. After the evaluation is completed, we will announce the winning entries and the names of the authors in the newspaper.

We sincerely thank all the authors and readers for their enthusiastic support and concern for this essay contest.
