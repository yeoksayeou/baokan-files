	Unjust practices are difficult to curb because they are backed by unjust reasoning. The sophistication, uniqueness, and seeming plausibility of these fallacies can be astonishing. Here are some common examples:

	Using one's position to seek personal gain—“Those who rely on the mountains eat from the mountains, those who rely on the water eat from the water.”

	Neglecting duties and causing significant losses to the state—“Mistakes are inevitable; it's a learning experience.”

	Selectively implementing party policies—“Analyze specific problems specifically.”

	Using one's position to place relatives and friends in jobs—“Promoting relatives is not taboo.”

	Creating various pretexts to distribute money and goods—“Seeking benefits for the people.”

	Using public funds for entertaining and gift-giving—“Necessary social interactions.”

	Hoarding goods and causing price hikes—“Following the law of value.”

	Using the pretext of learning to travel and sightsee—“Strengthening horizontal connections.”

	Competing to go abroad—“Broadening one's horizons.”

	Seeking promotions—“Volunteering like Mao Sui.”

	Speculating in goods—“Activating the market.”

	And so on, the list goes on. With these fallacies, some people engage in unjust practices with a clear conscience and boldly. Therefore, unjust reasoning cannot be ignored; it must be exposed and its true nature revealed.

　　“不正之理”种种
    不正之风之所以难禁，因为背后有不正之理。那些歪理之花哨，之奇特，之“妥贴”，足以令人“叹服”。试举常见几例：
    利用职权谋取私利——“靠山吃山，靠水吃水”。
    失职渎职，给国家造成重大损失——“失误在所难免，缴学费”。
    执行党的方针政策各取所需——“具体问题具体分析”。
    利用职权安插子女亲友——“内举不避亲”。
    巧立名目滥发钱物——“为群众谋利益”。
    动用公款请客送礼——“必要的交际应酬”。
    囤积居奇，乱涨物价——“遵循价值规律”。
    借取经之名游山玩水——“加强横向联系”。
    争相出国——“开阔眼界”。
    伸手要官——“毛遂自荐”。
    倒买倒卖——“活跃市场”。
    凡此种种，不一而足。有了这些歪理，有些人搞起不正之风来就心安理得、胆大妄为。因此，对不正之理不能听之任之，要揭穿它的假象，把它的内核抖出来曝光。
