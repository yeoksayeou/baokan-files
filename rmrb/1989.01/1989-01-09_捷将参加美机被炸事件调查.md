A batch of Czechoslovakian experts will arrive in Britain next week to assist in the investigation of the Pan Am aircraft that was blown up over Lockerbie last month, according to a statement from the British Foreign Office on January 6.

Their primary purpose in coming to Britain is to help determine whether the plastic explosive used in the bombing, which resulted in the deaths of 270 people, was manufactured in Czechoslovakia.

Meanwhile, a statement from the Czechoslovakian Foreign Ministry on January 6 reiterated that "Czechoslovakia firmly opposes all forms of terrorism and has never provided any terrorist organizations with weapons, explosives, or other materials." This statement was in response to Western media reports alleging that the Pan Am aircraft was destroyed using explosives produced in Czechoslovakia.

　　捷将参加美机被炸事件调查
    英国外交部六日说，一批捷克斯洛伐克专家将于下周到达英国，帮助调查上个月在洛克比上空炸毁泛美航空公司一架客机的事件。
    他们来英的主要目的是，帮助确定造成二百七十人死亡的炸机事件是否用的是捷克斯洛伐克制造的塑性炸药。
    另据来自布拉格的消息，捷克斯洛伐克外交部一月六日就西方宣传媒介谣传泛美航空公司飞机是使用捷克斯洛伐克生产的炸药炸毁的言论发表声明重申，“捷坚决反对各种形式的恐怖主义，从未向任何恐怖组织提供过武器、炸药和其他物品”。
