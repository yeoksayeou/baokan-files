Last year, many people in our county were bitten by rabid dogs, with half of the victims being children. Since the beginning of this winter, people have been frightened whenever they see a dog with red eyes on the street.

However, some parents still allow their children to keep and play with dogs (see the bottom left image). Isn't this like raising a tiger and leaving a disaster for the future? Look! This child who was playing with a dog was bitten and suffered from spasms of the throat muscles and hydrophobia when the disease manifested. How painful and pitiful it must have been (see the right image)!

    养犬害处多
    去年，我县被狂犬咬伤的病人很多，其中半数是儿童。今年入冬以来，人们一见红眼狗上街，便惊恐不安。
    可是，有些家长却又听任孩子养狗玩狗（见左下图），这岂不是养“虎”遗患吗？瞧！这个玩狗被狗咬伤的孩子发病时喉肌痉挛、怕水，该是多么痛苦、可怜（见右图）！
