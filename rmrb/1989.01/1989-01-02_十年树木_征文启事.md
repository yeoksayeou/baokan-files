Call for Essays on "Ten Years of Tree Planting"

This year on March 12th, our motherland will celebrate the 10th Arbor Day. Over the past decade, a nationwide tree-planting and afforestation campaign has been sweeping across the country, with hundreds of millions of acres of barren mountains donning green attire. As our country faces a forest resource crisis, new greenery brings fresh vitality and hope to the land.

The saying goes, "Ten years to grow a tree." Trees planted a decade ago have now grown tall, with countless individuals dedicating their hard work. To further inspire the enthusiasm for tree planting and spread more greenery across the land, our newspaper, in collaboration with the Ministry of Forestry, is launching the "Ten Years of Tree Planting" essay contest. The essays should focus on reviewing the achievements of forestry reform and construction over the past ten years, analyzing current issues and new situations, and looking ahead to the future development of forestry. Topics can include an individual (a pioneer in greening and tree planting), a location (an advanced unit or region), or an event (new experiences or innovations). The content must be true, and the style and format can vary. The text should be concise and generally not exceed 1,500 words.

The essay submission period starts immediately and ends on March 13th of this year. Manuscripts, once accepted, will be compensated. After the contest, the Ministry of Forestry and our newspaper will jointly form a selection committee to evaluate and award first, second, and third prizes, along with prize money and certificates.

Please send your submissions to "People's Daily Economic Department," postal code 100733, and mark the envelope with "Ten Years of Tree Planting Essay Contest."
