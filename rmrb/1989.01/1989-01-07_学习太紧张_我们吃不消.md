To improve teaching quality, our school has set the following schedule: wake up at 5:30 AM, have morning exercises, then self-study until 7:00 AM; classes start at 8:00 AM with four sessions in the morning; three sessions in the afternoon. This way, our entire lives consist of studying, eating, and sleeping. We shout, we cry, we truly can't catch our breath. The intense studying has caused many students to suffer from insomnia. Although the school stipulates that we should sleep from 9:30 PM to 5:30 AM the next day, a total of 8 hours, the heavy homework makes it impossible for us to sleep well or eat properly. Now, we can only sleep for six or seven hours each day. If this continues, even if the school sends all of us to university, we will only become a group of bookworms, high scorers but low achievers, and deformed individuals.

### 学习太紧张　我们吃不消

　　学习太紧张　我们吃不消
    为了抓好教学质量，我校特规定以下作息时间：每天５点半起床，早操后上自习课至７点；８点上课，上午共４节课；下午３节课。这样，我们的全部生活是：学习、吃饭、睡觉。我们喊，我们叫，我们真要喘不过气来了。紧张的学习，使许多同学患了失眠症。虽然学校规定的睡眠时间是每天晚上９点半至第二天早晨５点半，共８个小时，可是，繁重的作业使同学们睡不踏实，吃不好饭。现在，我们每天只能睡六七个小时。这样下去，学校即使把我们都送进大学，也只能是一群书呆子，是高分低能的畸型人。
