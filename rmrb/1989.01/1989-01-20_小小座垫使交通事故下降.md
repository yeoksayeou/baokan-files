    If one only glances at it, people would hardly imagine that a small cushion could have such an unexpected effect on reducing traffic accidents. The special cushion produced by Jiangsu Province's Jingjiang Special Cushion Factory since April last year has brought good news to drivers and the elderly.

    After the traffic management department of Jingjiang County equipped 70% of the vehicles in the county with this type of cushion, the traffic accident rate from July to November 1988 decreased. For this reason, Shanghai Volkswagen Automobile Co., Ltd. was the first to equip the Santana sedan with this type of cushion. The China Automobile Industry Association sent a letter to automobile manufacturers and sales departments nationwide, requesting the promotion and use of this type of cushion in automobiles.

    Currently, this new health product, which utilizes advanced foreign equipment and traditional Chinese medicine meridian theory, combining Chinese medicine massage and tuina, has obtained a national patent and has attracted the interest of some foreign businessmen.

    The Public Security Department, the Ministry of Machinery and Electronics Industry, the Ministry of Light Industry, the Ministry of Health, and other relevant departments believe that the production of this cushion should be expanded and promoted to society.

　　小小座垫使交通事故下降
    本报讯  记者方良根报道：如果只是粗粗地看上一眼，人们实在想象不出一个小小的座垫居然可以对减少交通事故的发生产生意想不到的作用。江苏省靖江特种座垫厂去年４月投产的一种电动按摩座垫给各类驾驶人员及老年人带来福音。
    靖江县公安交通主管部门为全县７０％的车辆配置这种座垫后，使１９８８年７月至１１月份的交通事故率下降。为此，上海大众汽车有限公司率先在桑塔那轿车上配置了这种座垫。中国汽车工业联合会向全国各汽车生产厂和销售部门发函，要求在汽车上推广使用这种座垫。
    眼下，这种利用国外先进设备，采用我国传统中医经络学说原理，融中医按摩、推拿于一体而研制成的新型保健产品，已获国家专利，并引起一些外国客商的兴趣。
    公安部、机械电子工业部、轻工业部、卫生部等有关主管部门认为，这种座垫应扩大生产，推向社会。
