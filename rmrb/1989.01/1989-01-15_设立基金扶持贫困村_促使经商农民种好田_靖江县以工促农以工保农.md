	Establishing a Fund to Support Poor Villages and Encourage Farmers to Engage in Commerce and Cultivate Land Properly
	Jiangsu Province's Jingjiang County Promotes Agriculture Through Industry and Protects Agriculture Through Industry

	BEIJING, Jan. 14 (Xinhua) -- How can regions with developed township enterprises promote and protect agriculture through industry to achieve a bumper harvest? The experience of Jingjiang County in Jiangsu Province over the past few years provides a fresh example. Despite facing unfavorable factors, the county's agriculture has developed steadily while its industry has grown rapidly.

	Feng Guoping, deputy county magistrate in charge of agriculture, told reporters that relying solely on state and county financial investments is far from enough to develop agriculture. The county must rely on the development and strengthening of township enterprises to promote agricultural development, with the two supporting and promoting each other. The county's township enterprises have evolved from initially supplementing and building agriculture to the current system of agricultural development funds mainly financed by township enterprises. Last year, the county raised 3 million yuan for agricultural development funds. The county used part of the funds to dredge 17 secondary canals, solving the irrigation problems of more than ten townships. During the autumn plowing season, the county used the agricultural development funds to purchase 325 strip sowing machines and 334 plowing machines, ensuring that the autumn sowing was not delayed.

	To fundamentally stabilize agriculture, the county has, since 1986, had county-owned factories (including key township enterprises) support industrially backward poor villages, strengthen village-level collective forces, and increase investment in agriculture. Over more than two years, the supported villages have seen their township enterprises grow from nothing to something, from small to large, and most have taken shape. Zhouhe Township's Zushi Village was once a poor village lagging behind in industry and agriculture. In early 1986, Jingjiang County's Surveying Instrument Factory extended a helping hand, training 10 technical and managerial personnel for the village and investing 100,000 yuan. The village subsequently established a food processing plant, an electrical materials factory, and a prefabricated concrete plant, providing a source of income. Last year, the village's industrial output value exceeded 10 million yuan.

	Jingjiang County has an average of only 7 mu of land per person. Forty-three percent of the rural labor force are engaged in industry and other sectors, and many working farmers have turned agriculture into a sideline. They have land but do not cultivate it, and some farmland is even abandoned. To change this situation and make the best use of every piece of land, the county has, since the autumn sowing season of 1987, implemented a dual-track assessment system for working farmers in rural areas and enterprises. The assessment content mainly follows the agricultural and sideline production contracts signed by working farmers at the beginning of the year, with a focus on grain and cotton production tasks. Those who fail to complete the tasks will have the amount deducted at the end of the year as agricultural development funds. For individual farmers who do not fulfill contracts or fail to complete tasks, business licenses will be delayed, not issued, or revoked. The results of the trial implementation of the dual-track assessment system show that cadres and workers who care about and support agriculture have increased, and prominent issues such as hidden and open abandonment of land have been relatively well solved.

　　设立基金扶持贫困村　促使经商农民种好田
    靖江县以工促农以工保农
    本报讯  记者孙健、李济国报道：乡镇工业较发达的地区如何以工促农以工保农，夺取农业丰收？江苏省靖江县近几年工业连年增长，农业在不利因素制约下仍稳步发展，给人们提供了新鲜的经验。
    主管农业的副县长冯国平对记者说，农业的发展仅靠国家、县里的财政投入是远远不够的，必须依靠乡镇工业的发展壮大促进农业的发展，两者相互依赖、相互促进。这个县乡镇企业对农业的支持已由开始的“以工补农”、“以工建农”发展到目前的以乡镇工业出资为主体的建农基金制度。去年，全县筹集建农基金达３００万元，县里用一部分资金修挖二级河道１７条，解决了十几个乡的抗旱之忧。秋播之际，全县利用建农基金购买条播机３２５台，开墒机３３４台，保证秋播不误农时。
    靖江县为从根本上稳定农业这个基础，从１９８６年开始由县属工厂（包括骨干乡镇企业）扶持工业后进的贫困村，加强村级集体力量，以增加对农业的投入。两年多时间，被扶持的村办工业，有的从无到有，有的从小到大，大都初具规模。侯河乡祖师村曾经是个工业农业落后的穷村，１９８６年初靖江县测绘仪器厂向他们伸出了援助之手，帮助这个村培养１０名技术管理人员，给予１万元的投资，先后办起了食品加工厂、电器材料厂和水泥预制场，使这个村有了取财之源，去年工业总产值超过百万元。
    靖江县人均仅７分地，占农村总劳力４３％的农民从事工业和其他产业，许多务工农民把农业变成副业，有责任田，没责任种，有的农田甚至抛荒。为改变这种现状，珍惜利用每分土地，这个县从１９８７年秋播开始对务工经商农民实行了农村和企事业单位双轨考核制度。考核内容，主要按照务工农民年初签订的农副业承包合同要求进行考核，重点是粮棉生产任务，凡完不成任务的，年终兑现扣罚金额作为建农基金。对农民个体户不执行合同或完不成任务的，缓发、不换发和没收营业执照。双轨考核制度试行的结果，干部职工关心农业支持农业的多了，较好解决了明暗抛荒等突出问题。
