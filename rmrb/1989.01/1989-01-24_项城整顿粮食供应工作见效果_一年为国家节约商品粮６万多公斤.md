Xiancheng Improves Grain Supply Management with Results

		Xiancheng County, Henan Province, has achieved significant results in its grain supply management reform, saving the country over 60,000 kilograms of commercial grain in one year.

		The report says: Last year, Han Bingyan, the director of the Xiancheng County Grain Bureau, discovered that the number of people receiving high-grade labor subsidies in the grain supply records of the bureau was much higher than the number recorded by the county labor bureau. It was clear that there were some false entries. With the assistance of relevant departments, they began a thorough investigation and survey of all 18 enterprises and institutions in the county in September last year. During the on-site investigation, they found that 76 people in the county's machine tool factory were receiving the grain ration standard for heavy manual labor, but 20 of them were actually light workers, miscellaneous workers, and administrative staff. They ordered the relevant parties to make immediate corrections, saving an average of 54 kilograms of commercial grain per person per year for the country.

		During the investigation, they also discovered that some people, although deceased, continued to receive commercial grain. In Shuizhai Town, a deceased elderly person had been dead for two and a half years, but his family had bribed officials to conceal the death. Only after this investigation was the household registered and grain supply stopped. For those who impersonated others or falsely reported the birth of infants, in addition to immediate corrections, they were also given appropriate penalties according to the severity of the offense, effectively curbing the wrongdoings.

　　项城整顿粮食供应工作见效果    
    一年为国家节约商品粮６万多公斤
    本报讯  河南省项城县粮食局在整顿中，堵住了城镇粮食供应中的“跑冒滴漏”，一年为国家节约商品粮６万多公斤。
    去年，该县粮食局长韩炳炎发现，在粮食局口粮供应名册上，吃高工种补助粮的人数远远大于县劳动局掌握的数字，其中显然有假。于是，他们在有关部门的协助下，于去年９月开始对全县１８个企事业单位逐册、逐户调查摸底。他们在实地调查中发现，县机床厂７６人享受重体力劳动的口粮标准，而其中２０人实际上是轻工、勤杂工和管理人员，他们责成有关当事人立即更改，平均每人每年为国家节约商品粮５４公斤。
    在调查中，他们还发现有的人虽然死亡，家里仍冒领商品粮。水寨镇一老人已死亡２年半，他的家人买通干部，一直隐瞒不报，经这次调查后，才注销户口，停止粮食供应。对冒名顶替，多报出生婴儿的居民除立即更改外，还根据情节给予一定的处分、刹住了歪风。
