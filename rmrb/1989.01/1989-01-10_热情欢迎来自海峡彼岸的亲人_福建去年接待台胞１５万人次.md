Fujian, the main ancestral home of many Taiwanese, welcomed 150,000 visits from relatives across the strait last year. This is more than six times the 22,000 visits recorded the previous year.

Fujian's fellow countrymen warmly welcomed their kin. To facilitate the visits of their relatives, Fujian's sea and air ports have set up special consultation desks, inspection counters, tax collection counters, and dedicated channels for Taiwanese to expedite their entry and exit procedures. At airports, docks, and passenger ships, special duty-free shops and counters have been established to provide discounted goods. Civil aviation, train stations, China Travel Service, and China International Travel Service have set up special ticket windows for Taiwanese, allowing them to purchase tickets first. Fuzhou and Xiamen have daily flights to and from Hong Kong. To shorten the time Taiwanese spend in Hong Kong, the provincial tourism bureau's Huamin Travel Company and the provincial tourism company have made every effort to improve efficiency and simplify procedures, providing convenience and saving time for visiting relatives, which has been well-received by the Taiwanese.

The long-term standoff and isolation between the two sides of the strait have made Taiwanese unfamiliar with the mainland. To help Taiwanese better understand their homeland, Fujian's tourism department, while enthusiastically introducing relevant information, also invited several general managers of Taiwanese travel agencies to visit and inspect last year. The provincial China Travel Service has established a Taiwanese Investment Consulting Service Company, sincerely helping Taiwanese with investment opportunities.

　　热情欢迎来自海峡彼岸的亲人
    福建去年接待台胞１５万人次
    本报福州１月９日电  记者张铭清报道：台胞主要祖居地福建，去年接待了来自海峡彼岸的亲人达１５万人次。这是前年２．２万人次的６倍多。
    福建的乡亲热情欢迎自己的亲骨肉。为了给亲人来闽提供方便，福建的海空口岸专设台胞咨询台、查验台、征税台和专门通道，为台胞快捷办理入出境手续提供方便。在机场、码头、客轮专设了台胞免税商店、专柜，优惠提供商品。民航、车站、中旅、国旅专设台胞购票窗口，台胞可优先购票。福州、厦门每天都有往返香港的旅游包机。为了缩短台胞在港滞留时间，省旅游局在港的华闽旅游公司和省旅游公司想方设法提高办事效率，简化手续，给探亲台胞提供方便、节省时间，受到了台胞的好评。
    海峡两岸长期的对峙封闭局面，使台胞对大陆感到陌生，为了让台胞更多的了解祖国，福建旅游部门在热情介绍有关情况的同时，去年还先后多次邀请台湾部分旅行社总经理前来考察。省中旅社还成立了台胞投资咨询服务公司，竭诚为台胞投资牵线搭桥。
