In recent years, the Soviet Union has carried out reforms in its foreign economic and trade system, and there have been changes in its strategic thinking for foreign economic relations. The Soviet Union believes that the development of foreign economic ties is of great significance for accelerating its technological progress and realizing the "strategy of accelerated economic and social development."

The Soviet Union's share in the world's total foreign trade is relatively small, accounting for about 4% to 5%. For a long time, the Soviet Union has regarded foreign economic and trade as a means of "balancing surpluses and deficits," and has not considered participating in international division of labor as its strategic goal. Therefore, the structure of its import and export commodities is irrational, and the progress of foreign economic and technological cooperation is slow. The Soviet Union now believes that foreign economic and trade ties are an important component of the national economy. Gorbachev emphasized that strengthening foreign economic and trade ties is a powerful "accelerator" for promoting national economic development and accelerating technological progress. Soviet leaders also said that in this era, the world is an interconnected and interdependent whole. Due to the internationalization of economic life and the rapid development of the scientific and technological revolution, many problems existing on Earth can only be solved through the joint efforts of all countries.

In developing foreign economic and trade ties, the Soviet Union has not abandoned the state's monopoly on foreign economic relations. The essence of the reform of the Soviet Union's foreign economic and trade system is: to strengthen centralized leadership in foreign economic and trade work, while expanding the autonomy of production units in this regard. Currently, more than 50 ministries and many enterprises in the Soviet Union have obtained the right to engage in foreign trade. Cooperatives have also begun to enjoy such rights. However, most of these foreign trade companies are engaged in the import and export of machinery manufacturing products. In the previous year, the foreign trade volume of these companies was 22 billion rubles, accounting for 20% of the state's total foreign trade volume and 40% of the total volume of machinery and equipment imports and exports. In other words, most of the power is still concentrated in the hands of the Ministry of Foreign Trade, especially fuel, raw materials, grain, and certain machinery and equipment are still operated by the Ministry of Foreign Trade. The purpose of the reform of the Soviet Union's foreign economic and trade system is to change from a single management system to a diversified management system, and to make joint ventures and enterprises, as the basic economic links, the main bodies of foreign economic relations. However, this transformation process will be gradually realized with the strengthening of legislation, the training of cadres, and the use of economic means to manage economic and trade activities.

The Soviet Union has taken many specific measures in developing foreign economic and trade ties, such as strengthening coordination. For this purpose, the State Council directly led the establishment of the State Committee for Foreign Economic Relations. Its main tasks are to formulate and ensure the implementation of the state's foreign economic strategy; to improve the role of foreign economic relations in accelerating national economic and social development; to coordinate and supervise the work of various foreign economic units, and to strengthen state discipline. At the beginning of last year, the Soviet Union also abolished the Ministry of Foreign Trade and the State Committee for Foreign Economic Relations, and on this basis established the Ministry of Foreign Economic Relations, whose functions are to provide policy guidance, information, and consulting, and to supervise business operations. In terms of strengthening legislation, in recent years, the State Council has passed a series of decisions to improve foreign economic relations, strengthen economic and technological cooperation, and establish joint ventures with various types of countries within the territory of the Soviet Union. In terms of integrating industry and commerce, after various ministries, joint ventures, and enterprises obtained the right to engage in foreign trade, the previous situation of domestic production and international market demand being disconnected, and production and foreign trade being separated, will be fundamentally changed. From the beginning of last year, companies and enterprises of various ministries and commissions with foreign trade rights formulated their own plans (including foreign exchange earning plans) and were directly responsible to the State Planning Commission. The amount of foreign exchange earned is an important indicator for measuring the activities of companies and enterprises, and the retention of foreign exchange for enterprises has also increased significantly.

In terms of the forms of developing foreign economic and trade ties, while not abandoning foreign trade as an important form, the Soviet Union places more emphasis on the form of economic and technological cooperation, and has also adjusted its import and export policies. Since 1985, the Soviet Union has decisively proposed to improve the structure of foreign trade commodities and expand the export of processed industrial products, first of all, to increase the proportion of machinery and equipment exports, gradually changing the practice of mainly exporting raw material commodities, and gradually reducing the import of grain, steel, and pipe materials, and increasing the import of products that promote domestic technological progress. Starting from 1987, in addition to allowing socialist countries, companies from Western developed capitalist countries and developing countries were also allowed to establish joint ventures within the territory of the Soviet Union. Recently, the Soviet Union has repeatedly stated that it will turn some cities in the Far East into economic special zones, which is another specific manifestation of its policy of opening up to the outside world. Unlike in the past, the Soviet Union has shown great interest in some international economic organizations. It has applied to join the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade and hopes to establish relations with the International Monetary Fund and the World Bank. While strengthening economic and technological cooperation with Europe and actively promoting the establishment of formal relations between the CMEA and the European Economic Community, the Soviet Union has also established the Soviet National Committee for Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation. It is reported that the committee will first strive to formally join the Pacific Economic Cooperation Conference and make efforts to establish relations with international organizations in the Asia-Pacific region, such as the Asian Development Bank.

In recent years, the Soviet Union has proposed a new strategy for foreign economic development in the new period. At the beginning of last year, the Politburo of the CPSU Central Committee approved the "Suggestions on Deepening the Process of Reforming the Foreign Economic System." The Soviet Union hopes that all this will effectively promote the development of the Soviet Union's foreign economic and trade relations.

　　苏联对外经贸体制的改革
    王文修
    近年来，苏联对外经贸体制进行了改革，对外经济战略指导思想有了变化。苏联认为，对外经济联系的发展，对其加速科技进步、实现“加速经济社会发展战略”具有重大意义。
    苏联的外贸额在世界外贸总额中的比重不大，约占４％—５％。因长期以来苏联把对外经贸看作“调剂余缺”的手段，没有把参与国际分工作为自己的战略目标，因而，进出口商品结构不合理，对外经济技术合作进展缓慢。苏联现在认为，对外经贸联系是国民经济发展的重要组成部分。戈尔巴乔夫强调，加强对外经贸联系是促进国民经济发展，加速科技进步的强大“加速器”。苏联领导人还说，在当今这个时代，世界是一个相互联系、相互依附的整体。由于经济生活国际化，科技革命日新月异的发展，地球上存在的许多问题只有靠各国的通力合作才能获得解决。
    苏联在发展对外经贸联系中并没放弃国家对对外经济联系的垄断权。苏联对外经贸体制改革的实质在于：既要加强对外经贸联系工作方面的集中领导，又要扩大生产单位在这方面的自主权。目前，苏联已有５０多个部和许多企业有了对外经营权。合作社也开始享受这样一些权利了。但在这些对外贸易公司中，大部分是经营机器制造业产品的进出口业务的。前年，这些公司的外贸额为２２０亿卢布，占国家外贸总额的２０％，占机器和设备进出口业务总额的４０％。也就是说，绝大部分的权力仍然集中在外贸部手里，特别是燃料、原料、谷物及某些机器和设备仍由该部统一经营。苏联对外经贸体制改革的目的在于：要由一元化经营改为多元化经营，并且使作为基本经济环节的联合公司和企业成为对外经济联系的主体。但这一转化过程将是随着立法的加强、干部的培养和用经济手段来管理经贸活动而逐步实现的。
    苏联在发展对外经贸联系方面采取了许多具体措施，如加强协调。为此成立了由部长会议直接领导的国家对外经济委员会。其主要任务是，制定和保证国家对外经济战略的实现；提高对外经济联系在加速国家经济和社会发展中的作用；协调和监督各涉外经济单位的工作，加强国家纪律等。去年年初，苏联又撤销了外贸部和对外经济联络委员会，在此基础上成立了对外经济联系部，其职能是实行政策指导、提供信息和咨询、监督业务。在加强立法方面，这几年部长会议通过了完善对外经济联系，加强经济技术合作以及同各类国家在苏联境内举办合资企业的一系列决定。在工贸结合方面，各部、联合公司和企业获得对外经营权以后，将从根本上改变过去那种国内生产和国际市场的需求脱节、生产与外贸分离的状况。从前年起，有对外权的各部委的公司和企业自己制订计划（包括创汇计划），并直接向国家计委负责。创汇多少是衡量公司和企业活动的重要指标，给企业的外汇留成也有了明显提高。
    苏联在发展对外经贸联系的形式上，在不放弃外贸这一重要形式的同时，更加重视经济技术合作这一形式，对进出口政策也作了调整。１９８５年以来，苏在对外经济战略中果断地提出要改进外贸商品结构扩大加工工业产品，首先是增加机器和设备的出口比重，逐步改变以出口原材料商品为主的做法，逐步减少粮食、钢材、管材等进口，增加能促进国内科技进步的产品进口。从１９８７年起，继允许社会主义国家之后，又允许西方发达资本主义国家和发展中国家的公司到苏联境内来兴办合资企业。最近苏联一再声称要把远东某些城市变为经济特区，这是它实行对外开放政策的又一具体表现。和以往不同，苏联对一些国际经济组织表现出了浓厚的兴趣。它既要求加入关贸总协定，又希望同国际货币基金组织和世界银行建立联系。苏联在加强与欧洲经济技术合作，积极促进经互会和欧洲共同体建立正式关系的同时，又成立了苏联亚太经济合作全国委员会。据称，该委员会将首先争取正式加入太平洋经济合作会议，努力同亚洲开发银行等亚太地区的国际组织建立关系。
    近年来，苏提出了新时期对外经济发展战略，去年初，苏共中央政治局核准了“关于深化对外经济体制改革进程的建议”。苏联希望，这一切将有效地推进苏联对外经贸的发展。
