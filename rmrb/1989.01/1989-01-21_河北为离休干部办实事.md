Hebei Does Practical Things for Retired Cadres

    BEIJING, Jan. 21 (Xinhua) -- As the year comes to a close, laughter and songs frequently echo from the Hebei Provincial Directly Affiliated Retired Cadres Activity Room. Retired cadres there happily chat and entertain themselves, praising the provincial party committee and government for doing practical things for them.

    Hebei is an old revolutionary base with a relatively large number of retired cadres. Last August, the provincial party committee and government issued a document, making new specific regulations on the political and living treatment of provincial-level retired cadres, and taking the lead in implementing them at the provincial level. To meet the needs of retired cadres to learn scientific and cultural knowledge, Hebei established an old-age university, with the first batch of students totaling 223.

    Hebei also made regulations on solving the "agricultural to non-agricultural" status for the spouses of retired cadres, requiring that within the quota of 0.15 percent, priority be given to handling the cases, and allowing the quota to be exceeded if it is insufficient. To improve the living conditions of retired cadres, the province allocated 640,000 yuan to build small sheds and vegetable cellars for some retired cadres of the provincial level. Many old comrades excitedly said: The party and government care so much about us, and we must surely contribute our remaining energy to the prosperity of Hebei's economy.

　　河北为离休干部办实事
    本报讯  记者陈国琦报道：年头岁尾，从河北省直老干部活动室，不时传出笑语歌声。离休干部在那里愉快地交谈、娱乐，交口称赞省委、省政府为他们办实事。
    河北是革命老区，离休干部较多。去年８月，省委、省政府发文，对省级离休干部的政治、生活待遇做了新的具体规定，并从省直带头落实。为适应离休干部学习科学文化知识的要求，河北创办了老年大学，首期学员２２３名。
    河北还对离休干部配偶解决“农转非”做出了规定，要求在千分之一点五指标内优先办理，指标不够的允许突破。为改善离休干部的居住条件，省里拨款６４万元，为省直部分老干部修建了小杂房、菜窖，不少老同志激动地说：党和政府这么关心我们，我们一定要为繁荣河北经济发挥余热。
