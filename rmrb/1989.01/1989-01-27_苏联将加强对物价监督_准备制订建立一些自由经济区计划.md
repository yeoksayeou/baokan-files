	Soviet Union to Strengthen Price Supervision

	The Soviet Union is preparing to establish some free economic zones

	New China News Agency, Moscow, January 25th - The Chairman of the Soviet State Prices Committee, Pavlov, stated in the second issue of the "Government Bulletin" published today that the state will strengthen price supervision and establish a unified national supervision system.

	He pointed out that the price situation in the Soviet Union is worrying. From 1985 to 1987, the retail price index for food and daily necessities rose by 3.3% and 1.7% respectively.

	In response to this situation, the Soviet Union has taken a series of measures. For example, the Council of Ministers has decided to encourage the production of low-priced goods for children and the elderly, stipulating that from January 1st of this year, subsidies will be provided for the wholesale prices of the above two categories of goods. The range of fashionable and high-quality products that can be priced higher has also been strictly limited. Only goods recognized as high quality and with obvious new product characteristics can be priced at contract prices, and the price increase has been reduced from 30% to 15%.

	In order to prevent commercial departments from continuing to sell vegetables and fruits at high prices during the supply peak season, it was decided to authorize local governments to set maximum prices for state-owned stores when necessary.

	The State Prices Committee also stipulated that goods sold by cooperatives at state retail prices or purchased by cooperatives at state prices, if not processed, the price increase shall not exceed 10%. This limits speculative activities of purchasing goods from state-owned commercial outlets and selling them at a large markup.

	New China News Agency, Moscow, January 25th - The Deputy Chairman of the Soviet State Committee for Foreign Economic Relations, Ivanov, said that the Soviet Union will formulate plans to establish free economic zones in some regions before this summer.

	According to a report by TASS today, Ivanov revealed that the Maritime Territory, Sochi, Odessa, Estonia, and 12 other regions have shown interest in establishing free economic zones. He believes that free economic zones can be established both in border areas and inland.

	Ivanov said that the special preferential conditions for foreign investors and Soviet enterprises in the free economic zones have been basically determined. Free economic zones will not be subject to Soviet customs restrictions, and additional guarantees will be provided for foreign investment there, implementing a commercial risk insurance system.

　　苏联将加强对物价监督     
    准备制订建立一些自由经济区计划
    新华社莫斯科１月２５日电  苏联国家价格委员会主席帕夫洛夫在今天出版的第二期《政府通报》上说，国家将加强对价格的监督，建立全国统一的监督系统。
    他指出，苏联的价格状况令人不安。１９８５—１９８７年，食品和日用品零售价格指数分别上升了３．３％和１．７％。
    针对这种情况，苏联采取了一系列措施。例如，苏联部长会议作出了鼓励生产廉价的儿童和老人用品的决定，规定从今年１月１日起，对上述两类商品批发价予以补贴。对可以加价的时髦产品和优质产品的范围也作了严格限制。只有确认为质量高，并明显具有新产品特征的商品才可以定合同价格，而且加价幅度从３０％降到１５％。
    为了限制商业部门在蔬菜和水果供应旺季继续高价出售，决定授权地方政府在必要情况下给国营商店规定最高限价。
    国家价格委员会还规定，按国家零售牌价批给合作社销售的或合作社按国家牌价采购的商品，如未经加工，加价不得超过１０％。这样就限制了从国营商业网点套购商品后大幅度加价出售的投机倒把活动。
    据新华社莫斯科１月２５日电　苏联国家对外经济委员会副主席伊万诺夫说，今年夏天以前苏联将制订出在某些地区建立自由经济区的计划。
    据塔斯社今天报道，伊万诺夫披露，滨海边疆区、索契、敖德萨、爱沙尼亚等１５个地区对建立自由经济区表现出兴趣。他认为，在边境地区和内地都可以建立自由经济区。
    伊万诺夫说，给自由经济区的外国投资者和苏联企业的特殊优惠条件已基本上确定。自由经济区将不受苏联海关限制，在那里将为外国投资规定附加保证，实行商业风险保险制度。
