Rectifying the tax order and strengthening tax work is an important part of improving the economic environment and rectifying the economic order. The core of this effort is to enforce the tax law strictly. The tax law is one of the country's important regulations, and it must be executed without deviation. Currently, there are issues of having laws but not following them, enforcing laws but not strictly, and not punishing law violations, leading to difficulties in tax collection. These problems are related to some people's weak legal awareness and also to the soft tax enforcement measures, lax tax management, and ineffective punishment of law violations. Therefore, it is necessary to strengthen tax law education, enhance tax enforcement authority, and foster a social atmosphere where paying taxes legally is honorable and tax evasion is shameful. For the minority in society who attack tax authorities, assault tax officials, and refuse to pay taxes, not only should they be dealt with according to tax law, but also according to criminal law to set an example for others.

To establish the concept of enforcing the tax law strictly, it is necessary to correct the wrong idea of opposing tax law enforcement to production development. Some people say, "With enterprise contracting and fiscal responsibility, a unified tax law is no longer necessary." Others say, "If taxes are not paid for three years, productivity will definitely develop." These statements are one-sided. The current tax policies and regulations in our country are formulated based on the overall interests of the national economy. Strictly enforcing the tax law is beneficial for adjusting the industrial structure, developing short-term production, and suppressing long-term production. It is also beneficial for reasonably regulating social distribution and protecting and promoting the development of productivity. Of course, to support the development of sectors urgently needed by the national economy, it is necessary to reduce or exempt taxes partially and in small amounts according to the tax law. However, if tax reductions and exemptions are indiscriminately granted, short-term production will not develop, and long-term production will not be suppressed, which will have adverse effects on the overall national economy.

Currently, some regional and departmental leaders lack a comprehensive perspective and have serious localism, often confined to local interests, arbitrarily "adapting" the tax law, causing disorder in the tax order. People often say, "Small rivers have water, big rivers are full." But if tax authority is dispersed, and local and departmental interests are pursued, it will result in small rivers having water while big rivers are dry, inevitably affecting the overall reform and development.

A good tax culture and discipline is the guarantee for strengthening tax work and adhering to the enforcement of tax law. Tax authorities and tax officials must be clean in their governance. The majority of our tax officials are good, but there are still a few who cannot resist the temptation of money, enforce laws laxly, and use taxes for personal gain. Therefore, the tax system should continue to emphasize the education of clean governance as a regular task to improve the quality of the tax official team.

Rectifying the tax order and strengthening tax work is not just the responsibility of the tax department but also requires the support of the whole society. Various levels of government should seriously implement the State Council's decision, widely publicize the spirit of the decision, and support the work of the tax department. Relevant departments, such as banks, railways, transportation, telecommunications, civil aviation, and industrial and commercial administration, should combine their own business with the tax department to actively block tax evasion loopholes, not giving lawbreakers any opportunity. The procuratorial, public security, supervision, and audit departments should use legal means to protect tax officials in collecting taxes according to law and ensure the implementation of the tax law. The whole society should form a good atmosphere of everyone abiding by and upholding the tax law, establishing a good tax order, ensuring the state's fiscal revenue, and promoting healthy economic development.

　　整顿税收秩序　严格依法治税
    本报评论员
  　当前，整顿税收秩序，强化税收工作，是治理经济环境、整顿经济秩序的一项重要内容，其核心是要依法治税。税法是国家的重要法规之一，只能执行，不得违背。目前出现的有法不依，执法不严，违法不究，有税难收的现象，与一些人的法制观念淡薄有关，也与税收执法手段偏软，税收管理不严，对违法行为打击不力有关。因此，要加强税法教育，强化税收执法权，形成依法纳税光荣，偷税漏税可耻的社会风尚。对于社会上少数围攻税务机关、殴打税务干部和抗税不交的不逞之徒，不但要究之于税法，而且要绳之以刑法，以儆效尤。
    树立依法治税的观点，要纠正把依法治税与发展生产对立起来的错误观念。有人说，“企业承包、财政包干，统一税法已无必要”。还有人说，“三年不缴税，生产力肯定能发展起来”。这些说法都是片面的。我国现行的税收政策法规，是从国民经济全局利益出发制定的。认真执行税法，有利于调整产业结构，发展短线，抑制长线，有利于合理调节社会分配，也有利于保护和促进生产力发展。当然，为了扶持国民经济急需的部门发展，按照税法规定，部分地、少量地减免税收也是必要的。但如果不加区别地乱开减免税口子，短线的得不到发展，长线的压不下来，反而会对国民经济的全局产生不利影响。
    当前，有些地区和部门的领导，缺乏全局观念，本位主义严重，往往囿于局部利益，随便“变通”税法，造成了税收秩序混乱。人们爱说“小河有水大河满”。但如果税权分散了，地方、部门各图其利，就会出现小河有水大河干涸，势必影响改革和发展的大局。
    良好的税风税纪是强化税收工作，坚持依法治税的保证。税务机关、税务干部为政要清廉。我们的税务干部队伍主流是好的，但也有极少数税务干部经受不起金钱的诱惑，执法不严，以税谋私的事件还时有发生。为此，税务系统要把为政清廉的教育，作为经常性的工作，继续抓下去，以提高税务干部队伍的素质。
    整顿税收秩序，强化税收工作，不单是税务部门的事情，更需要得到全社会的支持。各级政府要认真贯彻执行国务院《决定》，广泛宣传《决定》的精神，支持税务部门的工作。各有关部门，如银行、铁路、交通、邮电、民航、工商管理等都要结合自己的业务，积极协助税务部门堵住偷漏税的关口，不给不法之徒以可乘之机，公检法和监察、审计部门要运用法律手段保护税务人员依法收税，保证税法的贯彻执行。要使整个社会形成人人遵守税法，人人维护税法的良好风气，建立起良好的税收秩序，保证国家的财政收入，促进经济的健康发展。
