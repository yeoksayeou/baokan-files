The Asia-Europe Ping Pong Competition is Thrilling: Asia's Men's and Women's Teams Both Win in Team Matches

    Today, the team matches of the 4th Asia-Europe Ping Pong Competition reached a climax. After a 5-hour intense battle, Asia's second men's team narrowly defeated Europe's second team with a score of 5:4, securing Asia's victory in the men's team total score with 5:4.

    This men's team match was filled with dramatic twists. The Asia second team, consisting of Teng Yi, Chen Longcan, and Lu Chuansong, initially led with a score of 4:1. Just as victory seemed within reach, the Europe second team, comprising Persson, Mazunov, and Douglas, staged a comeback, winning three consecutive games to tie the score at 4:4. In the crucial ninth game, Lu Chuansong, who had lost the first two points, rallied with the support of the local audience to defeat Douglas with a score of 2:1. The third set was particularly thrilling, with Lu winning by a mere two points, 27:25, securing Asia's victory. Teng Yi and Chen Longcan both had two wins and one loss tonight.

    In the final women's team match, Asia's first team defeated Europe's first team with a score of 5:2. Tonight, Xuan Jinghe and Qi Baohua performed well, while Olympic champion Chen Jing played cautiously and lost to Gergelcheva and Nemes, only defeating Bratova. This time, the Asia women's team won with a total score of 3:1 over the Europe women's team. The men's and women's singles matches of the Asia-Europe Competition will be held in Bangkok on the 14th and 15th.

　　亚欧乒乓球对抗赛扣人心弦
    亚洲男女队团体赛双双得胜
    本报香港１月１２日电  第４届亚欧乒乓球对抗赛团体赛今晚在高潮中结束。亚洲男二队经过５个小时的苦战，终于以５∶４险胜欧洲二队，从而使亚洲队在男子团体总分上也以５∶４胜了欧洲队。
    这场男子团体激战颇有戏剧性。由滕毅、陈龙灿和卢传淞上阵的亚洲二队先以４∶１领先，眼看就要取胜。这时由佩尔森、马祖诺夫和道格拉斯组成的欧洲二队急起直追，连扳三盘，打成４∶４。关键性的第９盘中，前面连丢两分的卢传淞在本地观众的助威下，以２∶１力克道格拉斯。第三局最为扣人心弦，卢仅以２７∶２５两分之差决定了亚洲队胜利的命运。滕毅和陈龙灿今晚都是２胜１负。
    女子团体最后一战，亚洲一队以５∶２胜欧洲一队。今晚玄静和、齐宝华发挥较好，奥运会冠军陈静则打得拘谨，先后负于格尔格尔切娃和内梅斯，只赢了布拉托娃。这次亚洲女队以总分３∶１胜欧洲女队。亚欧对抗赛的男女单打比赛将于１４、１５日在曼谷举行。
