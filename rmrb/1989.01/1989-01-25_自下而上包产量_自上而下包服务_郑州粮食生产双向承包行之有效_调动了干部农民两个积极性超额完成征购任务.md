Zhengzhou suffered severe natural disasters last year, yet its autumn grain production increased by 24.6% compared to the previous year. In previous years, local officials struggled to meet grain procurement targets, but this year, the entire city completed the task ten days ahead of schedule and exceeded the target. This is a new change brought about by Zhengzhou's implementation of the dual contracting system for grain production.

Market Committee Secretary Cao Lei told reporters that the dual contracting system for grain production involves clearly defining targets and responsibilities at each level from the city to the county, township, village, and individual farmer. This system ensures that grain production quotas are met from the bottom up, while services for agricultural production are provided from the top down. The responsibilities, rights, and obligations between different levels are specified in contractual agreements. This approach has motivated both officials and farmers.

In response to the decline in grain production in recent years, the Zhengzhou Municipal Committee and Municipal Government proposed at the beginning of last year that grain production targets be broken down and implemented at each level from the city to the county, township, village, and individual farmer. However, farmers raised concerns: "To complete the grain production task, who will provide the fertilizer? Who will be responsible for water and electricity?" In response, the Municipal Committee and Municipal Government decided that village officials would provide services to farmers, and townships would sign dual contracting agreements with villages. They also clearly specified that issues the townships could not resolve would be handled by the county, and issues the county could not resolve would be handled by the city. This formed a dual contracting system where production quotas are guaranteed from the bottom up and services are provided from the top down. Practice has shown that this approach has many advantages:

- It promotes the transformation of government and various functional departments from a purely command-oriented approach to a service-oriented approach. The dual contracting agreements signed by city, county, and township governments with their subordinates have created a binding effect, enhancing their sense of responsibility. They actively organize various industries to support agriculture and serve agricultural production. During last year's severe drought, various levels of government ensured that villages had electricity for irrigation. During the critical period for wheat sowing, when there was no diesel for mechanized farming, four city leaders intervened to coordinate the issue.

- It promotes the development of the agricultural socialized service system. Over the past year, the number of four-level service organizations serving agriculture in the entire city has grown to over 20,000. Among the 2,241 administrative villages in the city, 84% can provide farmers with four types of services: unified seed supply, irrigation, mechanized farming, and pest control.

- It enhances the enthusiasm of various levels of government for agricultural investment. Last year, the city invested 47.11 million yuan in agricultural water conservancy projects, of which 39.63 million yuan was raised by villages and households. These funds were used to drill wells, complete matching projects, and repair ditches, adding 95,000 mu of drought-resistant and flood-resistant fields to the city.

- It strengthens the relationship between officials and the people. The dual contracting system binds the hearts of officials and farmers together. Developing production and completing grain procurement tasks have become shared goals for officials and farmers.

　　自下而上包产量　自上而下包服务    
    郑州粮食生产双向承包行之有效    
    调动了干部农民两个积极性超额完成征购任务
    本报郑州１月２４日电  记者李杰报道：郑州市去年遭受严重自然灾害，秋粮产量比前年却增长２４．６％。往年粮食征购，乡村干部费很大劲，仍交不齐，今年全市十天之内就超额完成了征购任务。这是郑州市实行粮食生产双向承包责任制以来，给这个市农村带来的新变化。
    市委书记曹磊对记者说，实行粮食生产双向承包责任制，就是在市县乡村和农户之间，层层明确目标任务，自下而上保证粮食产量指标的完成，自上而下为农业生产提供服务。上下级之间的责权利用合同契约形式规定下来。这样做，调动了干部、农民两个积极性。
    针对近年来粮食生产滑坡的情况，去年初，郑州市委、市政府提出从市到县、乡、村、农户层层分解粮食生产指标，层层落实承包责任制，保证粮食生产。但农民提出：“要完成粮食生产任务，没有化肥谁解决？没水没电谁负责？”对此，市委、市政府决定，村干部对农户包服务，乡对村签订双向承包责任书，并明确规定，乡里解决不了的问题由县解决，县里解决不了的问题由市解决，这样就形成了由下而上包产量、由上而下包服务的双向承包责任制。实践证明，这个作法很有好处：
    ——促进了政府和各职能部门由单纯指挥型向服务型的转变。市、县、乡政府同下级签订的双向承包责任书，对各级政府产生了约束力，增强了责任感。他们积极组织各行各业支援农业，为农业生产服务。去年大旱时节，各级政府压城保乡、压工保农，解决了农民抗旱用电的问题。小麦播种的关键时刻，机耕没柴油，四位正副市长出面协调。
    ——推动了农村社会化服务体系的建设。去年以来，全市为农业服务的四级服务组织发展到２万多个，全市２２４１个行政村中，能向农民提供统一供种、灌溉、机耕、防治病虫害等四种服务的占行政村总数的８４％。
    ——增强了各级政府对农业投入的积极性。去年，全市用于农田水利建设的投资达４７１１万元，其中村、户集资达３９６３万元。用这些资金打机井、搞配套、修复沟渠，使全市新增旱涝保收田９．５万亩。
    ——密切了干群关系。双向承包责任制，把干部和农民的心连在一起，发展生产、完成粮食上交任务，成为干部、农民的共同目标。
