The number of synthetic chemicals created by humans worldwide has already exceeded two million, and new chemicals are emerging at a rate of approximately 250,000 per year. Among these, the number of chemicals used in daily consumer products reaches 500 per year. The widespread presence of these synthetic chemicals raises questions: Are they a blessing or a curse for humanity? Do they have physiological and pathological effects on the human body? Do they cause carcinogenic, teratogenic, or mutagenic effects, potentially affecting our descendants and the human gene pool?

In the 1960s, the drug Thalidomide led to the birth of over ten thousand infants with phocomelia; Minamata disease and Itai-itai disease made Japan a focal point for global environmental pollution incidents. In recent years, the proportion of newborns with developmental abnormalities has been increasing, and there are thousands of known genetic diseases. The high cost of these incidents has led people to start paying attention to environmental benefits beyond economic gains.

Professor Jiang Zuoshu, head of the Department of Biology at the Second Military Medical University, highlighted some alarming pollution realities:

Synthetic Detergents: Detergents such as laundry powder, dishwashing liquid, and cleaning agents contain the main component dodecylbenzene sulfonate. External experiments have shown that this substance can be carcinogenic at high doses.

Pesticides: The presence of pesticides in homes and courtyards has led to an increase in the incidence of primary liver cancer and aplastic anemia in rural areas. It is undeniable that organic phosphorus pollution is a contributing environmental factor.

Food: Sweetening agents and preservatives used in food processing pose safety concerns. Large amounts of saccharin are known to be carcinogenic, as confirmed by foreign animal experiments.

Cosmetics: Aromatic hydrocarbons in hair dyes can induce skin cancer, as reported in foreign literature. Some domestic hair straightening products contain substances that can cause genetic damage, as confirmed by animal experiments at Harbin Medical University. Additionally, there are cosmetic creams with excessive hormones, weight-loss creams, and low-quality skincare products...

### 化学产品大量涌入生活是福还是祸？

　　化学产品大量涌入生活是福还是祸？
    全世界人工合成的化学物质迄今已超过二百万种，新的化学物质还在以每年大约二十五万种的速度不断问世，其中用于生活消费的化学物质，每年达五百种。这些人工合成化学物质的大量出现对人类是福？是祸？会不会对人体带来生理和病理上的影响？会不会产生致癌、致畸、致突变作用，以至影响我们的子孙后代和人类的基因库？
    六十年代新药反应停曾导致了上万名海豹肢畸胎的出生；水俣病、痛痛病使日本曾一度成为全球注目的公害事件发生地；近年来新生儿发育异常的比例不断增加，遗传性疾病达数千种之多。高代价的牺牲，使人们开始普遍关心经济效益之外的环境效益了。
    第二军医大学生物学教研室主任蒋左庶教授列举了一些不容忽视的污染现实：
    合成洗涤剂　洗衣粉、洗洁精、洗涤灵这类表面活化剂，其主要成分是十二烷基磺酸钠。体外实验证明，此物质高剂量时有致癌作用。
    农药　农药进入农舍、庭院并存，使当前原发性肝癌、再生障碍性贫血在农村发病率上升。不可否认，有机磷的污染是致病的环境因素之一。
    食品　加工中使用的甜味剂、防腐剂均存在安全系数问题。大量的糖精是一种促癌剂，已为国外动物实验所证实。
    化妆品　关于染发剂中的芳香烃类化合物，可诱发皮肤癌，国外已有文献报道，而国内某些冷烫精存在可致遗传损伤的物质，也已经哈尔滨医科大学的动物实验所证实；还有那激素超量的美容霜、减肥霜、质量低劣的护肤用品……
