Scientists at the Worldwatch Institute in the United States have predicted that by the year 2050, the rate of sea level rise will reach one inch per year. By that time, the expansion of the oceans due to heating and the melting of polar ice caps will cause sea levels to rise by three feet.

Researchers published an article in the institute's journal stating that major cities around the world, such as New York, New Orleans, Venice, Bangkok, and Taipei, will face the threat of being submerged by the sea. Coastal low-lying areas worldwide will be severely affected, with coastal wetlands ecosystems destroyed, marine production sharply declining, and coastal economic development hindered.

Due to the rise in sea levels, 80% of the wetlands along the U.S. coast will disappear. By the year 2100, the coastlines of many countries may need to be redrawn. According to recent estimates, the Maldives may disappear from the face of the Earth, and several Pacific islands, including Kiribati, Tuvalu, and the Marshall Islands, will also be threatened. Additionally, 46 million people will be forced to flee the delta regions along the coasts of Bangladesh and Egypt.

　　科学家预言到二○五○年世界海平面将增高三英尺
    新华社华盛顿１月１８日电  美国世界观察研究所的科学家说，到２０５０年世界海平面的上升速度将达到每年一英寸。到那时，由于海洋受热而膨胀和极地冰川融化将使海平面高度增加３英尺。
    研究人员在该所的杂志上发表文章说，世界上的一些大城市，如纽约、新奥尔良、威尼斯、曼谷和台北将面临着被海水淹没的前景，世界上一些沿海低洼地受到的影响最大，海岸湿地生态被破坏，海产量将急剧下降，海岸经济发展受到影响。
    由于海平面上升，８０％的美国海岸湿地将消失。到２１００年，许多国家的海岸线将可能重新划定。根据最近的估计，马尔代夫可能从地球上消失，一些太平洋岛屿：基里巴斯、图瓦卢和马绍尔群岛也将受到威胁。另外４６００万人将被迫逃离孟加拉和埃及沿岸的三角洲地区。
