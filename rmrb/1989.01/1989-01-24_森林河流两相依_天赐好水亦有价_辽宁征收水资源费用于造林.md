Everyone acknowledges that forests have a role in water conservation, but few consider the economic value of this role. Liaoning Province has broken away from the traditional notion that "natural water has no value." Starting in 1988, the province has resolutely implemented the "Temporary Measures for the Collection and Management of Water Resource Fees in Liaoning Province." The expected revenue of 20 million yuan will be used entirely for afforestation in the Liaohe River basin to strengthen ecological environment construction. This is the first such initiative in the country. Experts in the field of forestry have highly praised this decision, calling it a far-sighted policy. The recent meeting of the Chinese Society of Forestry awarded the "Chen Rong" prize to those involved in the initiative.

Using water from reservoirs and tap water requires payment, which is only natural. But why should natural water, which is a gift from heaven, be subject to water resource fees paid to the forestry and water conservancy departments? Liaoning Province also went through a process of understanding this issue.

The main course of the Liaohe River is 523 kilometers long within Liaoning Province, and heavy rains occur in July and August every year, with floods occurring every 5 to 10 years. In recent years, the frequency of floods has increased. In the past, the focus of Liaohe River basin management was often on water conservancy. However, practice has shown that this only treats the symptoms and not the root cause.

A few years ago, the Provincial Science and Technology Association organized experts to conduct a comprehensive survey and discussion on the management of the Liaohe River basin. They unanimously agreed that the increasing frequency and severity of natural disasters in Liaoning are due to the destruction of forest resources. Experts say that building reservoirs and drilling wells only solves the problem of "containers" and "bowls." If there is no water in the "container," it is all in vain.

To have water, there must be forests. Only with green mountains can there be long-flowing water. Currently, Liaoning Province has a large demand for timber, and the amount of commercial timber is increasing. Many forest areas have cut down all the mature forests, and large areas of natural forests and middle-aged and young forests have disappeared. This has led to a decrease in the soil and water conservation functions of vegetation in mountainous and hilly areas, and ecological imbalance. Due to the destruction of vegetation upstream, during the rainy season, rivers rise and fall sharply, causing breaches and floods that damage fields and gardens. After the rainy season, drought conditions worsen, reservoirs lack water, wells dry up, and the groundwater level drops. The government has repeatedly ordered afforestation in mountainous and hilly areas, but planting a mu of trees requires 50 to 100 yuan, with the state subsidy being only 7 yuan. Farmers who sell timber for little profit have no funds to invest in long-term forest production. Therefore, barren mountains remain, and the effect of afforestation is minimal.

In 1985, a severe flood in Liaoning caused significant losses, and people deepened their understanding of the importance of forests from the punishment of nature. In December 1987, the main leaders of the Provincial Party Committee and Government, after widely soliciting opinions, decided to levy water resource fees to develop water conservation forests in mountainous and hilly areas.

Currently, the forestry department has completed the planning for the construction of water conservation forests in mountainous and hilly areas. As soon as the 1988 settlement is completed and the financial department transfers the water resource fees to the forestry department, construction can begin immediately.

### 森林河流两相依　天赐好水亦有价  辽宁征收水资源费用于造林

　　森林河流两相依　天赐好水亦有价    
    辽宁征收水资源费用于造林
    本报讯  记者谢联辉报道：人们都承认森林有水源涵养的作用，但很少把森林的这种作用放在经济的天平上衡量。辽宁省突破“天然水无价值”的传统观念，自１９８８年起坚决实施《辽宁省水资源费征收管理暂行办法》，把这笔预计可达２０００万元的费用，全部用于营造辽河流域水源涵养林，加强生态环境建设。这在全国是第一个。林学界专家对此予以高度评价，认为是有远见的决策。日前结束的中国林学会会议授予有关倡导者“陈嵘”奖。
    使用水库里的水和自来水要付钱，理所当然。而自然水是“老天爷”给的，为什么要交水资源费给林业、水利部门？对这个问题，辽宁省也有一个认识过程。
    辽河干流在辽宁省境内长达５２３公里，常年在７、８两个月下暴雨，洪灾５至１０年一遇。近些年洪灾频率增加。怎样治理辽河流域，过去往往把重点放在水利上。实践证明，这只能治标不能治本。
    省科协前几年在组织专家综合考察基础上，就辽河流域治理进行了充分研讨，一致认为辽宁自然灾害日渐频繁、严重的原因，是森林资源遭到破坏。专家说，建水库、打机井，只解决了盛水的“缸”和“碗”。如果“缸”里无水那也白搭。
    要有水就得有森林，山青才能水长流。现在，辽宁省建设用材量大，商品材不断增加，很多林区县城过熟林基本砍光，大面积天然林、中壮龄林消失，导致山地丘陵植被保土蓄水功能减弱，生态平衡失调。由于上游植被破坏，雨季时，河流陡涨陡落，溃堤决口、冲田毁园时有发生；雨季后，旱情加剧，水库缺水，机井干枯，地下水位降低。政府曾三令五申山区丘陵造林，可是植一亩地的树，需要５０元至１００元，国家补贴７元，卖木材获利不多的林农，无资金投放到生产周期长的山林。所以，荒山依旧，植树造林效果甚微。
    １９８５年，辽宁一场大水灾，损失严重，人们从大自然的惩罚中加深了对森林的认识。１９８７年１２月，省委、省政府主要负责同志在广泛征求意见的基础上，下决心征收水资源费，以发展山地丘陵地区的水源涵养林。
    目前，林业部门已经作好营造山区、丘陵水源涵养林的规划，只要１９８８年结算完毕，财政部门把水资源费转给林业部门，便可立即施工。
