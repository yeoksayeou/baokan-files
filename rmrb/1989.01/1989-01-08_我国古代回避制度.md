The avoidance system in ancient China

Due to the slow development of commodity economic relations, personal relationships centered on blood ties played a significant role in the political life of ancient China. Since the Eastern Han Dynasty, the harmful effects of these relationships became increasingly apparent. Therefore, starting from the Eastern Han Dynasty, the feudal ruling class began to attach great importance to the avoidance system, treating it as a crucial political institution. From the Eastern Han to the Sui Dynasty, the avoidance system was in its formative period. The Tang and Song Dynasties marked its maturity, while the Ming and Qing Dynasties saw its further refinement.

The avoidance system can be broadly categorized into three types:

	1. Relatives' Avoidance

Each dynasty had different regulations regarding relatives' avoidance. The Eastern Han Dynasty was the first to establish rules, formally stipulating that local officials with kinship ties could not hold positions that would interfere with each other. During the Wei, Jin, and Northern and Southern Dynasties, the scope of avoidance was expanded from relatives to general kin, and from local officials to central officials. The Tang Dynasty had more specific and comprehensive regulations regarding relatives' avoidance. The Song Dynasty further expanded the scope of relatives' avoidance, stipulating that relatives within five generations, as well as related in-laws, must avoid positions that have supervisory or interfering relationships. After the Ming Emperor Yongle, it was clearly stipulated for the first time in history that imperial clan members could not hold official positions or participate in imperial examinations; they were only granted titles and provided for.

The Qing Dynasty, except for not regulating the imperial clan's avoidance, had the most comprehensive regulations for both central and local officials. Local officials whose relatives were involved in criminal punishment, imperial examinations, financial taxation, official evaluations, and supervision, regardless of how distant the relationship, as long as they belonged to the same clan, were ordered to have the lower-ranking official step down.

	2. Regional Avoidance

Regional avoidance emerged later. The Tang Dynasty was the first to make clear regulations in this regard. The Song Dynasty was the first to stipulate that officials must generally avoid their native places, and even regions where they had property must be avoided. By the Ming Dynasty, local officials avoiding their native places had become a common practice. The Qing Dynasty further quantified the avoidance areas, stipulating that officials must avoid regions within a 500-li radius (including neighboring provinces) of their native place.

	3. Teacher-Student and Friendship Avoidance

Regulations regarding teacher-student and friendship avoidance began in the Tang Dynasty. For example, it was stipulated that in imperial examinations, candidates with old friendships with the examiner must also undergo a "separate examination" like the examiner's relatives. The Qing Dynasty had the strictest regulations regarding teacher-student and friendship avoidance. Previous dynasties' regulations were limited to the field of imperial examinations. The Qing Dynasty was the first to break through this limitation, stipulating that teacher-student relationships formed during imperial examinations must be avoided in subsequent appointments.

### 我国古代回避制度

　　我国古代回避制度
    由于商品经济关系发展缓慢，以血缘关系为核心的私人关系在我国古代政治生活中占有重要地位，东汉以来，它的危害性日益明显。因此，从东汉开始，封建统治阶级日益重视回避制度，把它当做一项重要的政治制度来建设。东汉至隋是回避制度发生时期，唐宋是它的成熟时期，明清则是成熟后完善时期。回避制度大致可分为三类：
    　　　　一、亲属回避
    各个朝代对亲属回避的规定大不一样。东汉最先制订法规，正式规定地方官员中有姻戚关系的不能担任职务相妨的官职。魏晋南北朝把回避的范围，由姻戚扩大到一般的亲属，由地方官员扩大到中央官员。唐朝对亲属回避的规定已相当具体、完备。宋朝亲属回避的范围进一步扩大，规定对五代以上亲属及相关外亲只要职事有统属或相妨关系的，都必须回避。明成祖以后，在历史上第一个明确规定宗室不能做官，不能参加科举考试，只封爵供养。
    清朝除了对皇族未规定回避外，对京官和地方官的规定是历代最完备的。地方官凡属刑惩、科举考试、财政税务、官吏考核和监察等重要部门的亲属，不分远近，只要是同一宗族的，都令官小者回避。
    　　　　二、地区回避
    地区回避产生较晚。唐朝才正式作出这方面的明确规定。宋朝第一个规定官员要普遍回避本籍，并且对非本籍而有地产的地区也要回避。到了明朝，地方官员回避本籍已成通例，清朝更把回避的区域数量化，即官员本籍五百里以内（包括邻省）的地区，都得回避。
    　　　　三、师生朋故回避
    从唐朝开始有这方面的规定，如规定在科举考试中，与主考官有故旧关系的考生也要像主考官亲戚一样进行“别头试”。清朝的师生朋故回避是历代最严的。以前各朝的师生朋故回避都限于科举考试领域，清朝第一次突破这一领域，规定科举考试中形成的师生关系，在以后的任职中要回避。
