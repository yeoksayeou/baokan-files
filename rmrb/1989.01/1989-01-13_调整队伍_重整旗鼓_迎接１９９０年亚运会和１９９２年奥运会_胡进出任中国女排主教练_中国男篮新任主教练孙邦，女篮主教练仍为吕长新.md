Sun Bang becomes the new head coach of the Chinese men's basketball team, while Lu Changxin remains the head coach of the women's basketball team

Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, January 12th - Reporter Li Beida reports: The deputy director of the State Sports General Administration's Training Bureau, Zhang Jian, announced today in Beijing the selection of coaches for the national women's volleyball team and men's and women's basketball teams. The 33-year-old former Chinese men's volleyball player Hu Jin will take over as the head coach of the Chinese women's volleyball team, with Jiang Sheng as the assistant coach. The head coach of the women's basketball team will remain Lu Changxin, and the head coach of the men's basketball team will be Sun Bang, the head coach of the Nanjing Army team. Additionally, Chen Yunpeng and Zhao Qingkui will be responsible for the Chinese swimming team and the Chinese weightlifting team, respectively.

Zhang Jian said that this adjustment of several national teams is the first step in preparing for the 1990 Asian Games and the 1992 Olympics. The new coaches' term of office is four years.

The women's volleyball team, which just returned from a European tour yesterday afternoon, shared their plans with reporters. Hu Jin said that he and Coach Jiang had served as assistant coaches for the Chinese women's volleyball team from the end of 1984 to the beginning of 1986 and are familiar with the team. He said that the focus of their work will be on team management, training quality, and selecting young players as the main team members.

Both coaches believe that the Cuban and Soviet women's volleyball teams are not invincible. Jiang Sheng cited the example of the Chinese women's volleyball second team's performance in Europe: the Chinese team played four matches against the Cuban and Soviet teams, losing each with a score of 2:3, and the gap is not significant. They expressed that as long as the Chinese women's volleyball team's training gets back on track, regaining the advantage is entirely possible.

　　调整队伍　重整旗鼓　迎接１９９０年亚运会和１９９２年奥运会
    胡进出任中国女排主教练
    中国男篮新任主教练孙邦，女篮主教练仍为吕长新
    本报北京１月１２日讯  记者李北大报道：国家体委训练局副局长张健今天在京向新闻界宣布了国家女排和男女篮球队教练人选。３３岁的原中国男排队员胡进出任中国女排主教练，江申生任教练；中国女篮主教练仍由吕长新担任；男篮主教练由南京部队队主教练孙邦担任。另外，陈运鹏、赵庆奎将分别负责中国游泳队和中国举重队的工作。
    张健说，这次几支国家队的调整是为１９９０年亚运会和１９９２年奥运会作准备的第一步，新教练任期为４年。
    昨天下午刚刚从欧洲带队比赛归来的女排主教练胡进和教练江申生向记者们谈了他们今后的打算。胡进说，他和江教练曾在１９８４年底至１９８６年初任中国女排助理教练，对这支队伍比较熟悉。他说，今后的工作重点是抓队伍管理，抓训练质量，挑选队员以年轻选手为主。
    两位教练都认为古巴女排和苏联女排并不可怕，江申生以这次中国女排二队出征欧洲战绩为例说：中国队与古巴队、苏联队分别交战４场，均以２∶３失利，差距并不明显。他们表示，只要中国女排训练走上正轨，重新夺回优势完全可能。
