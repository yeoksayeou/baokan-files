	900,000 primary and secondary school teachers participated in the 1988 cultural and professional knowledge examination. The results are as follows: the pass rate for high school teachers is 43.13%, for junior high school teachers it is 39.62%, and for primary school teachers it is 34.72%. These rates represent increases of 14.97%, 17.55%, and 14.45% respectively compared to 1987. This information was released at the national conference summarizing the trial implementation of the teacher qualification certificate system.

	The implementation of the qualification certificate system for primary and secondary school and kindergarten teachers is a significant reform in teacher training. This system changes the single requirement of a qualifying degree to a dual requirement of a qualifying degree and a qualification certificate, opening up a path similar to self-study examinations for primary and secondary school and kindergarten teachers to pursue further education on the job. Since the trial implementation of this system in September 1986, it has shown positive effects in improving the quality of primary and secondary school and kindergarten teachers through pilot programs.

	The conference decided that in the foreseeable future, the teacher qualification certificate system will continue to be implemented. Under the principle of "three mainstays" — self-study, part-time, and correspondence education — efforts will be made to encourage school leaders to create necessary conditions for teachers to learn from each other and receive guidance and training. Additionally, teacher training colleges and normal universities will consciously incorporate teacher training into their regular educational programs.

	It is reported that this year, junior high school teachers will take examinations in 37 subjects; high school teachers will take examinations in 30 subjects; and for the subjects of English, music, fine arts, and physical education, which involve skill and technique assessments, the theoretical knowledge portion of the questions and the organization of the examinations will be handled by the respective provinces, autonomous regions, and municipalities directly under the Central Government.

　　９０万中小学教师专业考试揭晓
    我国教育界将继续执行考核合格证书制度
    本报讯  有９０万中小学教师参加的１９８８年文化专业知识考试的结果是：高中教师考试及格率达４３．１３％，初中教师达３９．６２％，小学教师达３４．７２％，分别比１９８７年提高１４．９７％、１７．５５％和１４．４５％。这是全国中小学教师考核合格证书试行工作总结会传出的信息。
    在中小学、幼儿教师中实行考核合格证书制度，是师资培训制度的一项重大改革。它使单一的合格学历要求变为合格学历和考核合格证书两种要求，为广大中小学、幼儿教师开辟了一条类似自学考试的岗位进修道路。自１９８６年９月试行这一制度以来，经过试点，初步显示出对提高中小学、幼儿教师素质的积极作用。
    会议决定，在今后相当长一段时间内，将继续贯彻执行教师考核合格证书制度。在坚持以自学为主、业余为主、函授为主的“三为主”原则下，继续大力倡导学校领导努力为教师互学互教和辅导培训创造必要条件，并进行适当的组织。进修院校、师范院校要自觉地把教师培训纳入正常的办学轨道。
    据悉，今年初中教师将开考３７门课程；高中教师将开考３０门课程；英语、音乐、美术和体育４个专业的７门有技能技巧考试的科目，从有关理论知识部分命题到各科考试的组织，都将由各省、自治区、直辖市负责。　　（张新华）
