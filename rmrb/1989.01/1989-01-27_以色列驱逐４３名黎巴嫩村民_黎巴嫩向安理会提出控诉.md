Israel Expels 43 Lebanese Villagers
Lebanon Files Complaint with Security Council

BEIRUT, Jan. 26 (Xinhua) — The Lebanese Ministry of Foreign Affairs sent a letter to the United Nations Security Council on January 26, urgently protesting Israel's expulsion of 43 Lebanese villagers from the "security zone" in southern Lebanon on January 25.

According to reports in Lebanese newspapers today, Israel claimed that these villagers had assisted local guerrilla forces as the pretext for their expulsion.

Yesterday, numerous Israeli soldiers entered the village of Sabaya in the "security zone," conducting house-to-house searches of the villagers' residences. They then loaded the villagers onto military vehicles and transported them outside the Israeli-occupied areas of southern Lebanon.

　　以色列驱逐４３名黎巴嫩村民
    黎巴嫩向安理会提出控诉
    新华社贝鲁特１月２６日电  黎巴嫩外交部２６日致函联合国安理会，就以色列２５日从黎巴嫩南部的“安全地带”驱逐４３名黎巴嫩村民的行径提出紧急控诉。
    据黎巴嫩报纸今天报道，以色列驱逐这些黎巴嫩村民的借口是他们帮助了当地游击队。
    昨天，许多以色列士兵进入“安全地带”的萨巴亚村，挨家挨户搜查这些村民的住宅，并把他们押上军车送到了以占领的黎南部地区之外。
