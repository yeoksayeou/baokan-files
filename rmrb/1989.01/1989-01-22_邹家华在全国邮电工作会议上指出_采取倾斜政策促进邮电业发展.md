In the midst of rectifying the economic environment and economic order, postal and telecommunications must remain a priority in the national economy, continuing to maintain a certain rate of development. State Councilor Zhou Jiahuai reiterated that the telecommunications industry, as one of the key industries for priority development, should adopt a policy of tilting investments to accelerate its development.

Zhou Jiahuai, at the conclusion of the 26th National Postal and Telecommunications Work Conference today, pointed out that although the postal and telecommunications industry has seen rapid development in recent years, due to its weak foundation, thin base, and numerous debts, it remains a weak link. The entire postal and telecommunications industry, including urban telephones, long-distance communications, international communications, postal communications, and rural communications, still faces sharp contradictions between supply and demand, remaining in a state of overall tension and shortage. Postal and telecommunications department personnel must have a sense of urgency and responsibility.

Zhou Jiahuai also emphasized that the development of postal and telecommunications should be planned comprehensively, leveraging the enthusiasm of local and departmental entities, combining efforts, and assuming responsibilities at different levels. The Ministry of Posts and Telecommunications should focus on the construction of first-level trunk lines. First, improve international channels; second, improve channels from the capital to regional centers and between regional centers and provincial capitals; third, improve channels in coastal open areas and economically developed regions; fourth, improve the organization and construction of postal transportation trunk networks. It is necessary to fully estimate and mobilize the enthusiasm of local, other departments, and large enterprises to develop telecommunications. In the current situation of tight funds and limited state investment, it is important to guide and lead the development of this important infrastructure for postal and telecommunications.

Zhou Jiahuai, on behalf of the State Council, extended warm congratulations to the million postal and telecommunications workers for overcoming difficulties and successfully completing the 1988 tasks. He pointed out that postal and telecommunications workers are a good team, but under the conditions of a commodity economy, there are still some improper practices. Currently, illegal activities must be severely cracked down upon.

　　邹家华在全国邮电工作会议上指出     
    采取倾斜政策促进邮电业发展
    本报北京１月２１日讯  记者高新庆、刘桂莲报道：在治理经济环境、整顿经济秩序中，邮电通讯仍要放在国民经济的先行位置，继续保持一定的发展速度。国务委员邹家华再次重申，通讯事业作为优先发展的重点产业之一，应该采取投资倾斜政策，加快发展。
    邹家华在今天结束的第２６次全国邮电工作会议上指出，这几年邮电通讯业虽然有了较快发展，但由于基础差、底子薄、欠帐多，目前仍然是个薄弱环节。整个邮电通讯事业，包括市内电话、长途通信、国际通信、邮政通信和农村通信，供需之间仍然存在着尖锐的矛盾，继续处在全面紧张和短缺状况，邮电部门的同志一定要有紧迫感和责任感。
    邹家华还强调了发展邮电通讯要在统筹规划下，发挥地方和部门的积极性，条块结合，分层负责。邮电部要突出抓一级干线的建设。一是把国际通道搞好，二是把首都到大区中心、大区中心到省会和省会之间的通道搞好，三是要把沿海开放地区和经济发达地区的通道搞好，四是把邮运干线网路组织建设好。要充分估计和调动地方、其他部门及大企业发展通讯的积极性，在当前资金紧张、国家投资较少的情况下，因势利导，把邮电通讯这个重要的基础设施搞上去。
    邹家华代表国务院对克服困难胜利完成１９８８年任务的百万邮电职工表示热烈祝贺。他指出，邮电职工是一支好队伍，但是在商品经济的条件下，还存在一些不正之风。当前一定要严厉打击违法活动。
