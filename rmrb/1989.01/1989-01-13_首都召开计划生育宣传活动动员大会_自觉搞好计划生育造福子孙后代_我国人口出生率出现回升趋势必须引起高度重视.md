Capital Holds Mobilization Meeting for Family Planning Propaganda Activities
Voluntarily Implement Family Planning for the Benefit of Future Generations
The Rising Trend in China's Birth Rate Must Be Given High Attention

NEW CHINA NEWS AGENCY, BEIJING, January 12 -- The mobilization meeting for family planning propaganda activities in the capital was held today at the Great Hall of the People.

Dian Jiyun, Rui Xingwen, Chen Muhua, Chen Xitong, Qian Zhengying, and others attended the meeting.

Chen Xitong, State Councilor and Mayor of Beijing, first expressed on behalf of the Party Central Committee and the State Council the highest respect to the broad masses of childbearing-age couples nationwide who voluntarily practice family planning, and extended sincere thanks to all family planning workers. He said that from 1978 to 1987, China avoided the birth of approximately 100 million people. However, since 1986, China has entered the third peak of childbirth since the founding of the nation, and the birth rate has shown a rising trend, with nearly 25 million births in 1987. This situation must be given high attention by the entire Party and the people of the nation.

Chen Xitong said that all ethnic groups in the country must start from the fundamental interests of the state and the nation, consider the overall situation of the state, and combine long-term interests with immediate interests, voluntarily practice family planning, and contribute to the happiness of future generations.

State Councilor Tian Jiyun made an impromptu speech at the meeting. He said that our national conditions are characterized by a large population and limited arable land, with per capita resources ranking low in the world. The current situation is that China's population is increasing by 14 to 15 million per year, while arable land is decreasing by 5 to 6 million mu. Food consumption is increasing by 2 to 3 billion jin per year. To achieve the goal of a moderately prosperous society by the end of the century, on the one hand, we need to vigorously develop productive forces, and on the other hand, we need to control the population to curb demand. Without practicing family planning, this goal cannot be achieved. Family planning work is indeed a glorious yet very arduous task. The broad masses of family planning workers at the grassroots level must persist in persuasion and education, use the method of guidance, and implement family planning work well.

This meeting was jointly convened by the State Family Planning Commission and the Beijing Municipal People's Government. Peng Peiyun, Director of the State Family Planning Commission, He Luli, Deputy Mayor of Beijing, Gu Yingqi, Deputy Minister of Health, He Qizong, Deputy Chief of the General Staff of the People's Liberation Army, Guan Tao, Secretary of the National Women's Federation, and Zhou Boqing, Vice Chairman of the China Family Planning Association, also spoke at the meeting.

　　首都召开计划生育宣传活动动员大会
    自觉搞好计划生育造福子孙后代
    我国人口出生率出现回升趋势必须引起高度重视
    新华社北京１月１２日电  首都计划生育宣传活动动员大会今天在人民大会堂召开。
    田纪云、芮杏文、陈慕华、陈希同、钱正英等出席了会议。
    国务委员兼北京市长陈希同首先代表党中央、国务院向自觉实行计划生育的全国广大育龄夫妇致以崇高的敬意，对全体计划生育工作人员表示衷心感谢。他说，从１９７８年到１９８７年我国大约少出生了１亿人。但是，从１９８６年开始，我国进入了建国后第三次生育高峰，人口出生率出现回升的趋势，１９８７年出生人口近２５００万。这种情况必须引起全党全国人民的高度重视。
    陈希同说，全国各族人民都要从国家和民族的根本利益出发，照顾国家大局，把长远利益与眼前利益结合起来，自觉地实行计划生育，为子孙后代的幸福做出自己的贡献。
    国务院副总理田纪云在会上作了即兴讲话。他说，我们的国情是人口多、耕地少，人均占有的物资资源居世界后列。现在的情况是，我国人口一年以一千四五百万的速度增长，而耕地却以五六百万亩地减少，粮食消费以每年二三百亿斤地增长。要实现本世纪末小康目标，一方面需要大力发展生产力，另一方面就要通过控制人口达到节制需求，不实行计划生育，这一目标是办不到的。计划生育工作确实是一项既光荣又非常艰巨的工作，战斗在基层的广大计划生育工作人员，一定要坚持说服教育，用疏导的办法，落实好计划生育工作。
    这次大会是由国家计划生育委员会、北京市人民政府联合召开的。国家计生委主任彭珮云、北京市副市长何鲁丽、卫生部副部长顾英奇、中国人民解放军副总参谋长何其宗、全国妇联书记处书记关涛、中国计划生育协会副会长周伯萍在会上也讲了话。
