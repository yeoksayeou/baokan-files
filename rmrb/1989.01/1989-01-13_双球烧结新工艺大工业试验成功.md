This major metallurgical research project, recently completed at the Yingkou Iron and Steel Plant in Yingkou City, has achieved success. The double-ball sintering process is one of the ten major technological development projects of the Anshan Iron and Steel Company. This process involves using a balling machine to separately produce basic and acidic balls, which are then scientifically mixed and sintered into high-quality self-fluxing artificial rich ore with excellent metallurgical properties.

The results of the large-scale industrial trial using this new sintering process show that the solid fuel consumption per ton of sintered ore and the coke ratio in the blast furnace have both been reduced by more than 20 kilograms, and the pig iron production has increased by 10%. This research achievement has been granted a national patent.

    双球烧结新工艺大工业试验成功
  　这项冶金部重点科研项目最近在营口市营鞍铁厂获得成功。双球烧结工艺是鞍山钢铁公司１０项重大技术开发课题之一。这项工艺是在生产烧结矿过程中，用造球机分别制成碱性球和酸性球，经科学混合后，烧结成冶金性能良好的自熔性人造富矿。
    采用这种新的烧结工艺进行大工业试验的结果表明：烧结矿固体燃料单耗、高炉焦比均降低２０公斤以上，生铁产量提高１０％。这项研究成果已获得国家专利权。
