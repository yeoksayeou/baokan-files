100,000 Party Members in Xinyang Strive to Be Poverty Alleviation Leaders

XINYANG, Jan. 23 (Xinhua) — How can rural party members play a model role in the new historical period? The 100,000 rural party members in Xinyang, Henan Province, have provided an answer by launching the "Strive to Be Poverty Alleviation and Prosperity Leaders" campaign.

Since the Xinyang Regional Party Committee decided to launch this campaign last year, statistics show that 100,000 rural party members have not only ensured that their own families have an average annual net income of over 200 yuan, but have also significantly improved the living standards of the impoverished households they are responsible for. Recently, Zhao Ziyang inspected Xinyang and listened attentively to the introduction of this campaign.

The Xinyang Regional Party Committee emphasized at the beginning of last year that whether rural party members can become poverty alleviation and prosperity leaders is an important criterion for assessing whether they can play a model role in the new period. The committee requires all rural party members to link up with two to three impoverished households through the original "Party Member Contact Households" and "Party Member Service Teams," helping the poor through wealth, and the strong leading the weak. They are required to formulate measures, standards, and deadlines for poverty alleviation, aiming for an average annual net income of 300 yuan for party members and their assisted objects by 1990, achieving basic poverty alleviation.

In addition to individual assistance, the campaign also includes collective assistance, known as "Rich Villages Helping Poor Villages." In Xinyang City's Wuxing Township, there are 10 villages; 5 have already achieved poverty alleviation and prosperity, while the other 5 are still below the poverty line. The township party committee believes that although party members in poor villages are also engaged in poverty alleviation, it is more necessary to organize rich villages to assist poor villages. The method of rich villages helping poor villages is: economically "supporting," guaranteeing loans or actively lending money; project-wise "guarding," helping poor villages select appropriate projects to avoid mistakes; management-wise "sharing experiences," introducing management methods from their own villages or managing for a period; and "rescuing" in critical moments.

Leaders of the Xinyang Regional Party Committee told reporters that this campaign not only brings economic benefits to farmers but also has significant political implications. It shows farmers that the party's work in rural areas is real, not empty, enhancing the prestige of party members and party organizations, and facilitating the implementation of the party's line, principles, and policies in rural areas.

### 明确目标　落实对象　严格措施  信阳１０万党员争当扶贫带头人

    信阳１０万党员争当扶贫带头人
    本报讯  记者李德民报道：新的历史时期农村党员怎样发挥模范作用？河南省信阳地区１０万农村党员开展“争当扶贫致富带头人”活动给人以启示。
    自去年信阳地委决定开展这一活动以来，据统计，１０万名农村党员除了自己家庭人均纯收入达到２００余元，每个党员负责联系的贫困户生活水平也得到相应的提高。最近赵紫阳同志视察信阳，认真听取了开展这一活动的介绍。信阳地委于去年年初强调，能不能当好扶贫致富带头人，是检验新时期农村党员能不能发挥模范作用的一个重要标准。地委要求广大农村党员按原来的“党员联系户”、“党员服务组”，联系两三户贫困户，以富扶贫，以强带弱，制订脱贫的措施、标准和期限，要求党员和他的扶助对象１９９０年人均纯收入要达到３００元，基本脱贫。
    开展“争当扶贫致富带头人”活动，除了个人之间的扶助，还有集体之间的扶助，叫“富村帮穷村”。信阳市五星乡有１０个村，５个已经脱贫致富，另５个还在贫困线下。乡党委认为，虽然贫困村里的党员也在扶贫，但组织富村扶助扶助更有必要。富村帮穷村的做法是：经济上“撑腰”，作保贷款或主动借款；项目上“把关”，帮助穷村选准项目，避免失误；管理上“传经”，介绍本村管理的办法或代为管理一段时间；关键时刻“救急”。
    信阳地委的领导同志告诉记者，开展这一活动不但在经济上给农民带来好处，在政治上也很有意义，它使农民看到，党在农村的工作是实的，不是虚的，提高了党员和党组织的威信，有利于党的路线、方针、政策在农村贯彻。
