Fiscal capacity is a crucial factor constraining deepening reform. Reform cannot proceed without the support of national financial resources, and the gradual strengthening of national financial resources relies on the continuous deepening of reform. These are two interdependent and mutually constraining issues. Currently, with the coexistence of dual systems and dual operational mechanisms, many economic relationships have not yet been fully straightened out, and new system elements have not yet taken a dominant position overall. Reform is at a critical juncture. Issues such as price reform, wage reform, housing rent reform, labor system reform, enterprise operational mechanism reform, the resolution of the "dual-track" pricing system for means of production, and the difficulties in overcoming investment shortages in basic industries are all closely related to the fiscal capacity of the state. They often become the focal points of many reforms, even serving as prerequisite constraints.

This situation is not surprising. A certain level of national financial resources and financial reserves is itself a necessary backbone for development and reform, and for effective macroeconomic regulation. Weak national financial resources not only make the risk-bearing capacity of reform extremely low, causing reform organizers to hesitate and struggle to make decisions, but also make certain reforms that require spending (such as appropriate compensation in price-wage reforms) seem daunting and end up as empty talk. Furthermore, in a situation where "soft budget constraints" are difficult to completely eliminate in the short term, and the distribution and property relationships between the central government, local governments, and enterprises are not yet standardized and clear, the role of the fiscal system in "lubricating" and "mediating" reform is indispensable. Additionally, for some transitional reforms, such as the transition of enterprises from non-standardized contract management to standardized operational methods, and the movement from a dual-track pricing system to a single-track system, although these will benefit the long-term strengthening of national financial resources, they still require necessary fiscal support during the transitional process to achieve their target models.

Domestic and international reform practices show that in the issue of fiscal conditions dragging or constraining other reforms, two tendencies are worth noting: one is to overlook the fiscal system's matching capacity in promoting reform, to emphasize the long-term effects of reform on strengthening national financial resources while neglecting the actual possibilities and urgent needs in the near term, leading to a contradiction between fiscal capacity and the matching requirements of other reforms, becoming a major constraint on deepening reform; the other is to overly emphasize current fiscal difficulties, ignoring the enormous potential within the fiscal system and related reforms, leading to obstacles for other reforms due to the fiscal system's own lagging reforms, clinging to the old, and poor allocation and use of national financial resources, thereby weakening the fiscal system's reform capacity due to various "internal consumption" or missteps.

Two distinctly different perspectives and approaches

How to view and analyze China's fiscal capacity involves two distinctly different perspectives and approaches: whether to passively endure pressure or actively reduce it; whether to passively defend or actively resolve it; whether to focus on revenue and expenditure management or on mechanism transformation; whether to calculate "dead accounts" or "live accounts." Different observation angles and reform approaches often lead to vastly different judgments and conclusions.

Indeed, if we statically analyze the problem and use the method of calculating dead accounts, in China's current total fiscal revenue, after deducting the so-called "food money," the necessary social maintenance expenses, and the guaranteed budgetary internal investment expenditures, there is very little fiscal capacity left to support reform. However, if we observe and think about the problem with a developmental and reform-oriented perspective, the situation will be quite different. If we fully recognize the serious existence of the "big pot" drawbacks in the current allocation and use of fiscal funds (expenses), and the resulting multiple losses; the significant leakage in taxation; the enormous drag and other adverse effects caused by the current pre-tax repayment system on the fiscal system; the abnormal growth of administrative expenses and social group purchasing power; the enormous fiscal expenditure pressure caused by the defects in the current subsidy system and its mechanism; the poor turnover, repayment, and increase in fiscal investment use, as well as the enormous fiscal energy that can be released through reform in these aspects, then our view of fiscal capacity will undoubtedly have a completely new and confidence-boosting understanding.

Deepening reform, enhancing fiscal capacity

How to enhance fiscal capacity in reform, from the urgent needs and realistic possibilities of mid-term reform, seems to focus on the following aspects:

1. Improving the allocation and use of national financial resources. (1) In the short term, while the implementation of the tax-sharing system is not yet feasible, adhere to the principle of unifying fiscal authority with administrative authority, clarify the fiscal revenue and expenditure (contract) scope between the central and local governments, reverse the situation where centralized collection has been broken but centralized expenditure has not been completely resolved, leading to the central government's fiscal difficulties year after year and the difficulty in controlling fiscal deficits. In the process of implementing local fiscal contracts, transfer the responsibility for local infrastructure construction, non-state key investment needs, various subsidy expenditures, and other increased expenditure and reduced revenue issues to local governments, and while tightening government expenditures, focus on hardening the budget constraints on administrative expenses, buildings, and social group purchasing power, and effectively control the "gate" of expenditure expansion. (2) In enterprise contract management, thoroughly correct the phenomenon of pre-tax contracts that currently exist to varying degrees in various places. Through hardening tax constraints and strengthening tax administration, ensure the stability and growth of fiscal revenue at all levels without allowing the tax adjustment function to be overshadowed by enterprise contract management; through clarifying property relationships, solve the problem of enterprise profit loss and excessive tilt towards consumption funds.

2. Establishing and improving the fiscal allocation mechanism. Having fiscal allocation without an effective allocation mechanism is a prominent problem that has existed in China for a long time, including the past ten years of reform. From the current situation, it is necessary to place the establishment and improvement of two aspects of the fiscal allocation mechanism on the important agenda of reform in the mid-term. Mainly: (1) Reform and transformation of the subsidy mechanism. Currently, the fiscal expenditure for various subsidies in China accounts for about 1/3 of the total fiscal expenditure. The amount and proportion are rarely seen in other countries (the total subsidy amount of Western countries generally does not exceed 2% of fiscal revenue, and the total subsidy amount of the Soviet Union and Eastern European countries, except for Poland, does not exceed 20%), among which the most prominent are various consumption-price subsidies, and there is a tendency for continuous expansion. To promote the mechanism transformation of consumption-price subsidies, in addition to implementing the "dark-to-light" reform and improving the transparency of fiscal price subsidies, it is also possible to consider changing the long-term single-direction subsidy to consumers into a dual-direction adjustment subsidy to both consumers and producers, in order to achieve the goal of both suppressing consumption and increasing supply; at the same time, change the "universal" food price subsidy to all consumers into a conditional differentiated subsidy, that is, only provide social welfare subsidies to low-income individuals, in order to achieve the effect of reducing the fiscal burden on the state, using the subsidy lever to adjust the social income structure, and ensuring the basic living needs of low-income individuals, so that their actual living standards do not decline. (2) Establish and continuously improve the fiscal investment mechanism. Especially for operational or profitable investments, ensure that they are used with compensation, turnover, and form a rolling fund investment use system, changing the long-term investment pressure on the state's fiscal system caused by non-preservation and non-appreciation investments.

3. "Resolving" fiscal expenditure pressure. For example, by changing the consolidated single-budget method to the dual-budget method, the range and possibility of generating fiscal deficits are reduced to construction and operational fiscal expenditures, thereby restraining the impulse of expenditure expansion in other areas; by distinguishing and separately handling enterprise wages, budgetary wages, and social welfare wages, to reduce the state's burden on wage expenditures; by reforming the unified management and fund-style turnover use of medical, funeral, retirement, and poverty relief expenditures, to ease the state's "net injection" pressure; by the role of township enterprises in compensating agriculture with industry and assisting agriculture with industry, to reduce the state's subsidy burden on the price adjustment of agricultural and sideline products, etc., are all effective ways to "resolve" fiscal pressure and correspondingly improve its reform capacity.

4. Enhancing fiscal strength through matching reforms. Such as transforming a portion of small state-owned enterprises into privatized sales, selling a portion of state-owned housing to non-publicly owned enterprises or urban residents, gradually promoting the paid transfer of urban land use rights with a limited term, etc. These three reform measures alone can bring in a considerable amount of revenue for the state, thereby greatly enhancing its reform capacity and bringing many benefits to reducing future fiscal expenditure pressure in related areas.

　　在深化改革中加强财政承受力
    刘溶沧
    财政承受力——深化改革的一个重要制约因素
    改革离不开国家财力的支持，国家财力的逐步增强有赖于改革的不断深化。这是两个相互制约而又相互依存的问题。在当前双重体制、双重运行机制并存，诸多经济关系尚未完全理顺，新体制因素在总体上还未占居主导地位，改革正处于转折关头的情况下，深化改革的财力支持问题，尤其显得紧迫而突出。诸如价格改革、工资改革、房租改革、劳动制度改革、企业经营机制改革，生产资料价格“双轨制”问题的解决，基础性短缺部门（产业）投资不足困难的克服等等，几乎无一不是同国家财政的承受能力有着密切的关联，从而往往成为许多方面改革的“聚焦点”，甚至是前提性的重要制约因素。
    这种情况其实并不足怪。因为一定的国家财力基础和财力后备，其本身就是发展与改革、进行有效宏观经济调控的必要后盾。脆弱的国家财力，不仅将使改革的风险承受能力极低，使改革的组织领导者顾盼甚多，决心难下，举步维艰；而且还将使某些必须“花钱”的改革（如价格—工资改革中的适度补偿等）望而却步，流于空谈。其次，在种种“软预算约束”现象短期内难以完全消除，中央与地方、国家与企业的分配关系、产权关系尚不规范、明晰的情况下，国家财政在改革中的“润滑”、“斡旋”作用自然不可或缺。此外，对于一些过渡性的改革，比如企业从非规范化的承包经营向规范化经营方式的过渡，价格双轨制向单轨制的运动等等来说，虽然从长远看将有利于国家财力的增强，但在其逐步实现目标模式的过渡性改革中，却离不开国家财政的必要支持。
    中外的改革实践表明，在国家财政状况对其他改革的拖拽或制约问题上，两种倾向都是值得注意的：一是在改革的推进上忽视国家财政的配套承受能力，在放权让利、降低财政收入比重的同时，片面强调改革对增强国家财力的长期效应，而不充分考虑近期的实际可能与紧迫需要，致使财政的承受力与其它改革的配套要求相矛盾，成为深化改革的一大制约因素；二是过分强调当前的财政困难，无视财政自身和相关改革所蕴藏的巨大潜力，以致因其本身的改革滞后，抱残守缺，国家财力分配使用不善等而对其他改革造成了很多障碍，使财政的改革承受力因种种“内耗”或失策而大为削弱。
    　　　　两种截然不同的视角和思路
    如何看待、分析我国的财政承受力，存在着两种截然不同的视角和思路：是被动承压，还是主动减压；是消极“招架”，还是积极“化解”；是注重收支处理，还是注重机制转换；是算“死帐”，还是算“活帐”。不同的观察角度和改革思路，往往会得出大相径庭的判断和结论。
    的确，如果静态地分析问题，采取算死帐的办法，在我国目前的财政收入总量中，除去所谓“吃饭钱”，必不可少的社会维持费用以及必须保证的预算内投资支出以外，可供用于支持改革的财力就所剩无几了。但是，如果我们用发展的、改革的眼光来观察和思考问题，情形就会大不相同。如果我们充分认识到迄今仍然严重存在的财政资金（经费）分配使用上的“大锅饭”弊端，及其所造成的多重耗减；税收上明显的惊人泄漏；现行税前还贷制度给财政造成的巨额拖累和其他不良效应；行政经费、社会集团购买力的超常增长；现行补贴制度及其机制缺陷所产生的巨大财政支出压力；财政投资使用上周转性、偿还性、增殖性极差等等问题，以及通过改革在这些方面所能释放出的巨大财力能量，那我们对财政承受力的看法就无疑会有一种全新的、使人信心倍增的不同认识。
    　　　　深化改革，增强财政承受力
    如何增强改革中的财政承受能力，从中近期改革的迫切需要和现实可能性来看，似可着重从下述几方面入手：
    一、完善国家财力的分配使用。（１）在短期内推行分税制尚不具备条件之时，坚持财权与事权相统一的原则，划清中央与地方的财政收支（承包）范围，扭转统收被打破而统支的问题并未完全解决，致使中央财政连年吃紧，财政赤字难以控制的被动局面。在实行地方财政承包的过程中，把地方性基础设施建设、非国家重点投资需求、各种补贴支出和其他增支减收问题的解决等交由地方财政负责，并在紧缩政府支出的同时，重点硬化对行政经费、楼堂馆所和社会集团购买力的预算约束，切实管住支出膨胀的“闸门”。（２）在企业承包经营中，彻底矫正目前事实上在各地不同程度存在的税前承包现象。通过硬化税收约束、强化税制管理，既保证各级财政收入的稳定与增长，又不致使税收的调节功能被企业的承包经营所湮没；通过产权关系的明晰化，解决企业利润的流失和向消费基金的过度倾斜。
    二、建立完善财政分配机制。有财政分配而无有效的分配机制，这是我国长期以来包括十年改革中所存在的一个突出问题。从现实情况看，中近期要把建立和完善两个方面的财政分配机制，摆在改革的重要议事日程之上。主要是：（１）补贴机制的改革与转换。目前我国用于各种补贴的财政所费已约占财政总支出的１／３左右。其数额之大、比重之高，在世界各国也是少见的（西方国家的财政补贴总额一般不超过财政收入的２％，苏联东欧国家除波兰外亦不超过２０％），其中又尤以各种消费性的价格补贴为最，且有继续膨胀之势。促成消费性价格补贴的机制转换，除了实行“暗转明”的改革，提高财政性价格补贴的透明度以外，还可考虑把长期以来仅仅只对消费者实行的单向补贴，改变为既对消费者又对生产者实行的双向调节性补贴，以达到既抑制消费又增加供给的目的；同时把对一切消费者实行“普惠制”式的食品价格补贴，改变为有条件的区别性补贴，即只对其中的低收入者进行社会福利性补贴，以期收到既减少国家财政拖累，利用补贴杠杆调节社会收入结构的功效，又能保证低收入者的基本生活需要，使其实际生活水平不致下降。（２）建立和不断完善财政的投资机制。特别是对其中的经营性或营利性投资，要做到有偿使用、周转使用，形成滚动式的基金性投资使用制度，改变长期以来由于无偿投资，非保值性、增值性投资给国家财政造成的巨大投资压力。
    三、“化解”财政支出的压力。比如通过改笼统的单式预算的办法为复式预算的办法，使产生财政赤字的范围和可能性缩小到建设性、经营性财政支出方面，以制约其他方面的支出膨胀冲动；通过对企业工资、预算性工资、社会福利性工资等的区别对待、分别处理，以减轻国家在工资支出上的压力；通过医疗、抚恤、退休、扶贫等支出的统筹管理、基金式周转使用等方面的改革，缓解国家财政的“净投放”压力；通过乡镇企业的以工补农、以工助农作用，减轻国家在农副产品调价上的补贴负担等等，都是使财政压力得到有效“化解”，并相应提高其改革承受能力的好办法。
    四、通过配套改革增强财政实力。诸如把一部分国有小企业实行改制拍卖，把一部分国有住宅出售给非全民所有制的企业或城镇居民，逐步推行城镇土地使用权的有偿期限转让等。仅是这三项改革措施，就可使国家财政得到一笔相当可观的收入，从而大大提高其改革承受力，并为减轻今后在相关方面的财政支出压力带来诸多裨益。
