Bulgaria is a country that cherishes culture. Whether in the capital Sofia or in remote villages, one can deeply feel this.

On an autumn day with a refreshing breeze, we were invited to participate in the cultural festival of Topolov County. This county is located 70 kilometers southeast of the capital of Yambol Province in southeastern Bulgaria. The county has a population of 25,000, with 6,000 people in the urban area. In terms of natural conditions, transportation, industrial and agricultural development, residential construction, and residents' living standards, it is only at the middle to lower level in the country. However, like other places, it holds a grand cultural festival every year.

The two-week-long Topolov County Cultural Festival has a rich variety of activities, including folk music concerts, art exhibitions, a discussion on "How to be a Good Neighbor," a discussion on "Women's Daily Beauty," children's puppet shows, meetings with writers, a discussion on "The History of Topolov City," a fashion show, and a gala evening with expatriate families living in the area, totaling 26 projects.

At the simple yet solemn opening ceremony, the chairman of the County Committee for Spiritual Development spoke concisely: "In the education of the working people and youth in communist spirit, culture is honorably fulfilling its mission. It contributes to the cultivation of all-round developed individuals. We have inherited the traditions of Bulgarian national culture. Our current task is to continuously enrich it and make it accessible to the masses."

In the evening, we went to a residential building where a discussion on "How to be a Good Neighbor" was being held in a room of about 30 square meters. The host said that how to treat neighbors is a problem often encountered in daily life. Whether you treat your neighbors with courtesy and warmth or with cold indifference, or even harm them, it has a significant impact on life. The speakers were very enthusiastic, including a sociology professor, university students, housewives, old workers, and an elderly woman over 70. Everyone said that neighbors should respect and help each other. Good neighborly relations can inspire people to be healthy and positive, relieve people's worries, and allow them to work happily, which is beneficial for individuals, the country, and society. Although the topics discussed were trivial daily matters, the expressions were so focused, and the atmosphere was so harmonious and lively. During the discussion, enthusiastic people brought out homemade or handmade delicacies for everyone to taste, such as sweet and crisp radishes, homemade grape wine, and homemade honey. Several elderly women were so happy that they sang folk songs that were popular when they were newlyweds.

Topolov City has 10 primary schools, 1 secondary school, and 1 vocational school. All school-age children in the city are enrolled in school, with no dropouts. In addition, there are 14 kindergartens. The county has 201 reading rooms, equivalent to our cultural centers, which are places for the masses to study and entertain. Reading rooms usually have libraries, choirs, orchestras, children's choirs, dance troupes, drama troupes, and photography groups. Some even have amateur art classes. During festivals and celebrations, performers dressed in traditional costumes sing and dance. During the Christmas singing festival, more than 70 teams and 2,000 people participated in the performances. In addition, the Youth Palace and puppet theater almost organize performances every month. The city's amateur art classes have recruited a group of children with painting talents, taught by a retired art teacher. The children's paintings have won international awards. Every village has a cinema. Bookstores regularly go to the countryside to sell books, and cultural troupes bring performances to the villages. These popular measures meet the farmers' demand for culture and art.

The local government attaches great importance to historical relics. Although the temple in the southern part of the city is ancient, it is well-maintained. A small cave on Sakka Mountain, measuring 4 meters in length, width, and height, is listed as a historical site because it has several human figures painted in red on the top, and the pigments are proven to be not modern products. It is protected with an iron gate, and the owner proudly told me that soon a road will be built to the mountain to receive tourists for visits. The county museum has collected some photographs, documents, and weapons used during the revolutionary war, as well as national costumes, daily necessities, and farming tools, many of which are contemporary and are exhibited in the museum. They collect these items to educate the people, especially the younger generation, about the history of revolutionary struggle and social development, which is very far-sighted.

　　保加利亚的乡村文化
    卫兴龙
    保加利亚是一个崇尚文化的国家。无论是在首都索非亚，还是在僻远的乡村，都会使人深深地感受到这一点。
    金风送爽的秋日，我们应邀参加了托波洛夫县的文化节活动。这个县位于保加利亚中部偏南的扬保州首府东南７０公里处。全县人口２．５万，市区６０００人。从自然条件、交通、工农业发展、住宅建筑以及居民生活看，它在全国仅位于中等偏下水平。但这里与其它地方一样，每年都举办一次盛大的文化节活动。
    为期两周的托波洛夫县文化节活动内容十分丰富，其中包括：民间音乐会、画展、“如何当好邻居”座谈会、“妇女日常美”座谈会、儿童木偶剧、与作家会见、“托波洛夫市的历史”座谈会、时装展览会以及与居住在本地的外籍公民家庭联欢晚会等，共有２６个项目。
    在简朴而又不失隆重的开幕式上，县精神发展委员会主席的讲话言简意赅：“在对劳动人民和青年进行共产主义精神教育中，文化光荣地执行着自己的使命，它为培养全面发展的人而贡献着力量。我们继承了保加利亚民族文化的传统，我们现在的任务是不断丰富它，并为人民大众所用。”
    傍晚，我们来到一幢居民楼，在一间面积约３０平米的大房间里，正在举行“如何当好邻居”的座谈会。主持人说，如何为邻，这是个在日常生活中经常碰到的问题。你对邻居礼貌相待、热忱相助，还是冷若冰霜，甚至以邻为壑，它在生活中的影响不可小视。发言者很踊跃，有社会学教授、大学生，有家庭主妇、老工人，还有年过七旬的老太太。大家说，邻里之间应互敬互助。好的邻里关系可以激发人健康向上，使人们解除后顾之忧，心情舒畅地投入工作，于人、于己、于国家都有好处。人们谈论的虽都是日常细小的事情，但神情是那样专注，气氛是那样和谐而热烈，座谈时，热心人还拿出亲手生产或制作的佳肴请大家品尝，又甜又脆的白萝卜、家酿的葡萄酒、自产的蜂蜜……几位老太太高兴得不禁唱起了她们做新媳妇时流行的民歌。
    托波洛夫市共有１０所小学、１所中学和１所中等技术学校。这里所有适龄少年儿童都在上学，没有辍学现象。此外建有１４所幼儿园。全县有２０１个读书室，相当于我国的文化馆，是群众进行学习、娱乐的地方。读书室通常设有图书馆、歌咏队、管弦乐队、儿童合唱队、舞蹈队、演剧队、摄影组，有的还有业余文艺进修班。每当节日庆典，演员们身着民族服装载歌载舞。圣诞歌唱节时，这里曾有７０多个团队、２０００多人参加文艺演出。此外，青年宫、木偶剧团也几乎月月组织演出活动。市里的业余美术班吸收了一批有绘画天赋的孩子，由一位退休美术教师授课，儿童们的画曾获得过国际奖。村村都有电影院。书店定期下乡售书，文艺团体送戏到农村。这些受欢迎的措施满足了农民对文化艺术的需求。
    当地政府对历史文物十分重视。城南的庙宇虽然年代久远，但维护得很好。萨卡山上长、宽、高各为４米的一个小山洞，只因在顶部用红颜色画有若干幅人像，而其颜料据考证系非现代产品，遂被列为古迹，安上了铁栅门，妥善地保护了起来，主人自豪地告诉我，不久将修通山路，接待旅游者参观。县博物馆搜集了革命战争年代的一些照片、文件和曾使用的武器，还有民族服装、居民日常用品和农具等人文展品，其中不少是当代的，作为博物馆。他们搜集这些用品，以革命斗争史和社会发展史教育人民，特别是教育青年一代，这是很有远见的。
