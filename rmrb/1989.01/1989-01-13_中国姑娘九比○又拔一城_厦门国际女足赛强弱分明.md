The Chinese women's football team today easily defeated the Philippine Makati Club team with a score of 9-0.

This is the second match in the Xiamen International Women's Football Invitational Tournament, where the Chinese team faced a significant disparity in strength. For the Chinese team, such a match with little opposition was less intense than a regular training session. Just four minutes into the game, forwards Niu Lijie and Wu Weiying each scored a goal. By halftime, the Chinese team had already scored seven goals, leading to a more cautious approach in the second half. Although the number of spectators at Xiamen People's Stadium increased compared to the first match two days ago, few applauded this match, which seemed more like a training exercise than a competitive game.

The Finnish team from Northern Europe does not appear to be an overwhelmingly strong opponent. Today, they only scored a goal when the Japanese team made a mistake on a goal kick. The Japanese team, on the other hand, used their skilled techniques and coordinated teamwork to launch continuous attacks, maintaining control for most of the game. If not for the Japanese forwards missing crucial shots in front of the goal, the Finnish team might have secured a 1-0 victory.

In the morning match, the Fujian team defeated the Xiamen team 1-0. Currently, the Chinese team and the Finnish team both have two wins, while the Japanese team and the Fujian team each have one win and one loss. The Xiamen team and the Philippine Makati Club team have both lost both of their matches.

　　中国姑娘九比○又拔一城
    厦门国际女足赛强弱分明
    本报厦门一月十二日电  记者汪大昭报道：九比零，中国女子足球队今天下午轻易地战胜了菲律宾马基沓俱乐部队。
    这是厦门国贸杯国际女子足球邀请赛开幕以来，中国队进行的第二场实力悬殊的比赛。对中国队来说，这样缺少对抗的比赛，还不如一次训练课的强度大。开场刚四分钟，中锋牛丽杰和边锋吴伟英便各得一分。上半时，中国队共进七球，以致易地再战时不得不脚下留情。尽管到厦门人民体育场看球的观众比两天前首轮比赛时增加了不少，但很少有人对这种照顾情绪的比赛报以掌声。
    来自北欧的芬兰队看来并非强大得难以匹敌。今天，她们只在日本队开球门球失误时，拣漏捅进一球。而哀军日本队则利用熟练的技术和默契的配合，不停顿地发动攻势，在大部分时间里掌握着主动权。如果不是日本队前锋几次在门前最后一击时腿软，芬兰队难保一比零胜局。
    在上午的比赛中，福建队一比零胜厦门队。目前，中国队和芬兰队都是两战两胜，日本队与福建队一胜一负，厦门队和菲律宾马基沓俱乐部队连败两场。
