Three Military Aircraft Collide in West German Airspace
Two Crash, Two Killed

BEIJING, Jan. 14 (Xinhua) -- Three military aircraft from West Germany and Britain collided in the airspace above West Germany's northern region near Wismar yesterday morning, resulting in two crashes and two fatalities.

Yesterday morning, eight Alpha Jet aircraft from the West German Air Force's 43rd Tactical Fighter Squadron based in Oldenburg were conducting low-altitude formation training at an altitude of 150-160 meters. At 9:52 AM, a British Royal Air Force Tornado fighter jet, which had taken off from the West German side of the German-Dutch border at the Bruggens Air Base, inexplicably entered the formation of West German aircraft. It first collided with one of the West German jets and then damaged another. The British aircraft crashed in a field about 200 meters from residential buildings, killing both crew members on board. One of the West German aircraft that was hit also crashed in a field, but the pilot successfully ejected using an ejection seat. The other damaged aircraft made an emergency landing.

This is the 545th aircraft to crash since the establishment of the West German Air Force, and the 234th aircraft from NATO countries to crash in West Germany.

    本报波恩１月１４日电  记者江建国报道：西德和英国的三架军用飞机昨天上午在西德北部维斯莫尔附近相撞，造成两架坠毁、两人丧生的严重后果。
    昨天上午，隶属驻扎在奥尔登堡的西德空军第４３战斗轰炸机联队的８架阿尔法—杰特式飞机，在１５０米—１６０米的低空进行编队训练。９时５２分，一架从德荷边界西德一侧布吕根空军基地起飞的英军旋风式战斗机，不知是何原因冲入西德飞行编队，先与其中一架相撞，后又伤了另一架。英军飞机坠毁在距民房２００米的田野里，两名机上人员丧生。被撞的一架西德飞机也坠毁在田野里，但飞行员利用弹椅跳伞成功，另一架飞机受伤后紧急降落成功。
    这是西德空军建立以来坠毁的第５４５架飞机，也是北约盟国在西德坠毁的第２３４架飞机。
