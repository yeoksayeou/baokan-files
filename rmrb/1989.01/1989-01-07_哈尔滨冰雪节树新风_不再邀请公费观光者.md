Harbin Ice and Snow Festival Breaks New Ground: No More Inviting Officials for Free Tours

A spokesperson for the Harbin municipal government recently announced that the 5th Harbin Ice and Snow Festival, to be held from January 5 to February 5, will no longer invite officials from other regions to come for sightseeing.

It is understood that in previous years, during the Ice and Snow Festival, the city's party and government organs would invite a group of old leaders, old comrades-in-arms, old acquaintances, and fellow countrymen working in Beijing and other provinces and cities to come for sightseeing and tourism. According to the current unwritten custom, as long as it is an official invitation, these invited officials would be considered as being on official business, and their travel expenses would be reimbursed by their units as official expenses. The public refers to this phenomenon as "official invitations" and "official tourism." Regarding this, the Harbin municipal government recently made a decision at a mayor's office meeting that "this year's Ice and Snow Festival will no longer invite officials from other regions to come for sightseeing," and hopes that this decision can become a new custom in the future.

　　哈尔滨冰雪节树新风
    不再邀请公费观光者
    新华社哈尔滨１月６日电  （记者谢金虎）哈尔滨市政府发言人日前宣布：今年１月５日至２月５日举办的第５届哈尔滨冰雪节，不再邀请外地党政机关干部专程来观光。
    据了解，往年冰雪节，这个市的党政机关总要邀请一批在北京及外省、市党政机关工作的老领导、老战友、老熟人和家乡人前来观光旅游。而按照目前不成文的惯例，只要是公家邀请，这些应邀前来观光旅游的同志就算“出公差”，他们的旅差费也就“名正言顺”地由所在单位公费报销了。群众把这种现象叫做“公费请客”、“公费旅游”。对此，哈尔滨市政府在最近的一次市长办公会议上专门作出了“今年冰雪节不再邀请外地党政机关干部专程来观光”的决定，并希望这个决定能成为今后的一条新惯例。
