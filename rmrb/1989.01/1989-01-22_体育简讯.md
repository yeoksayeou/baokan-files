	Currently, Qatar has two wins and one draw, accumulating 5 points, while Iraq has one win, one draw, and one loss, accumulating 3 points.

	Jose Francisco Renoso, president of the Cuban Football Association, stated that Cuba is actively seeking support from strong football nations in the Americas and Europe, hoping that coaches from these countries can go to Cuba to teach techniques.

	The promotion of wushu abroad requires improving the foreign language skills of wushu practitioners. The soon-to-be-published "Chinese-English and English-Chinese Wushu Vocabulary" is a good reference for reading English and Chinese wushu books. The book, with 220,000 characters, is divided into nine categories: barehanded techniques, weapons, etc. The authors, Jie Shoude and Li Wenying, have expertise in wushu.
