The issue of global population aging has garnered significant attention, and this is not a coincidence. According to analyses and predictions from the United Nations Population Division, the age structure of the world's population is shifting towards aging, with the growth rate of the elderly population being quite astonishing. In 1950, there were 214 million people aged 60 and above worldwide. By 2000, this number is expected to reach 590 million, and by 2025, it will increase to 1.121 billion. In 1950, there was one person aged 60 and above for every 12 people in the world. By 2025, this ratio will be one in seven. The proportion of people aged 60 and above will also change accordingly: from 8.5% of the world's total population in 1950 to 13.7% in 2025. Alongside the rapid increase in the number of elderly people, the aging process within the elderly population itself is also noteworthy: it is estimated that between 1975 and 2025, the proportion of people aged 80 and above among those aged 60 and above will increase from 11% to 14%, while the proportion of those aged 60-69 will decrease from 56% to 51%.

Due to the differences in the social and economic development stages of various countries and regions, there are significant differences in the trends of population aging.

In some economically developed countries, the number of people aged 60 and above accounts for more than 12% of the total population. Many of these countries began the process of population aging by the end of the 19th century. Countries such as Austria, Belgium, Britain, Hungary, East Germany, Denmark, Ireland, Italy, Norway, France, West Germany, Czechoslovakia, Sweden, and Switzerland currently have more than 15% of their total population aged 60 and above. The countries with the highest proportion of elderly people, Sweden, Britain, and Norway, all exceed 20%, with Sweden reaching 22%, surpassing the proportion of people aged 14 and below. According to predictions, by 2025, almost all economically developed countries will have a proportion of people aged 60 and above reaching 20%, with some countries reaching as high as 30%.

In contrast, almost all developing countries are characterized by a young population, with people aged 60 and above accounting for less than 4-8% of the total population. Taking India as an example, in 1985, people aged 60 and above accounted for only 6.83% of the total population. On the other hand, the aging process in developing countries is also rapidly advancing. Taking India as an example again, according to United Nations predictions, by 2025, people aged 60 and above will account for 14.45% of the total population. Looking at the entire developing world, the number of people aged 60 and above will increase sixfold by 2025 compared to 1950, reaching 800 million. It is clear that the process of population aging will soon be a global trend.

In essence, global aging is the result of a decline in the world's birth rate and an increase in the average lifespan due to improved health standards, a product of the world's economic and social development. Therefore, from an overall perspective, aging is not a bad thing; it reflects the progress of human society's developmental stages. Some insightful individuals clearly believe that there is no necessary antagonistic contradiction between aging and socio-economic development. The impact of aging on society, although objectively existing, is relative and temporary. The simple and clear truth is that aging extends not only human life but also intelligence. The elderly can contribute to society with their lifelong accumulated knowledge and experience during their remaining years.

Efforts should be made to rationally develop and utilize the human resources of the elderly, so that this precious asset of humanity can participate in society through various means. Simultaneously, they can achieve their own creativity and value in the continuous progress of society.

　　引人瞩目的世界人口老龄化问题
    顾镒塘
    世界人口老龄化问题引人瞩目，绝非偶然。据联合国人口司的分析和预测，世界人口的年龄构成现正朝着老龄化的方向发展，老年人口的增长速度相当惊人。１９５０年，世界６０岁以上的老人数为２．１４亿，到２０００年将达５．９亿，２０２５年将增至１１．２１亿。１９５０年，世界上每１２人中有一位６０岁以上的老人，到２０２５年，每７人中将有一位这样的老人。６０岁以上老人的比重也相应地发生变化：从１９５０年占世界总人口的８．５％增加到２０２５年的１３．７％。在老人数量增长较快的同时，老人自身老龄化的速度也颇令人注意：根据测算，１９７５—２０２５年间，８０岁以上老人占全部６０岁以上老人比重将从１１％增加到１４％，６０—６９岁老人的比重则将从５６％下跌至５１％。
    由于世界各国各地区所处社会经济和人口发展阶段的不同，各国各地区人口老龄化趋势上存在着很大的差别。
    世界上一些经济发达的国家，６０岁以上的老人数量都在全国总人口数的１２％以上，其中许多国家在上世纪末即已开始了人口老龄化的过程。奥地利、比利时、英国、匈牙利、民主德国、丹麦、爱尔兰、意大利、挪威、法国、联邦德国、捷克斯洛伐克、瑞典、瑞士等国６０岁以上老人数量现今已占到全国总人口数的１５％以上。老人数所占比重最高的瑞典、英国和挪威，均已超过２０％，瑞典甚至达到２２％，超过了１４岁以下人口的比率。根据预测，到２０２５年，世界上几乎全部经济发达国家，６０岁以上老人比率将达２０％，其中有些国家将达到３０％的高水平。
    与经济发达国家不同，世界上几乎所有发展中国家都属于人口年轻型国家，即６０岁以上人口不超过总人口数的４—８％，以印度为例，１９８５年６０岁以上人口仅占全国总人口的６．８３％。另一方面，发展中国家的人口老龄化过程也在迅速发展。仍以印度为例，据联合国预测，到２０２５年６０岁以上人口也将占到总人口的１４．４５％。从世界整个发展中地区来看，６０岁以上人口数量到２０２５年较１９５０年将增加６倍，达８亿之多。可见，人口老龄化过程在不远的将来遍及全球乃是世界人口发展的一个总趋势。
    说到底，世界老龄化是世界人口出生率下降，世界人口平均寿命由于健康水平的提高而延长的结果，是世界经济和社会发展的产物，因而，从总体上看，老龄化不是一件坏事，体现了人类社会发展阶段上的进步。一些有识之士明确认为，老龄化与社会经济发展之间没有必然的对抗性的矛盾，老龄化对社会的影响虽然客观存在，不利影响是相对的，暂时的。简单而又明确的道理是：老龄化使得人类在生命延长的同时智力也延长了，老人们可以其毕生积累的丰富知识和经验，继续在有生之年为社会作出贡献。
    努力合理开发和利用老年人的人力资源，从而使得老人这一人类的珍贵财富，能以多种途径参与社会，同时也在社会的不断前进中实现自己的创造与价值。
