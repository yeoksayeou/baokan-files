The Dow Jones Industrial Average today rose by 38.04 points to 2256.43 points, surpassing for the first time the level of 2246.73 points recorded on the last trading day before the stock market crash in October 1987.

Today also marked the largest single-day gain for this index since the market crash on October 19, 1987.

On the same day, the U.S. dollar also showed a strong rebound. At the close of trading in the New York foreign exchange market, the dollar's exchange rates against the Japanese yen and the West German mark rose from 1:127.45 and 1:1.8310 on the 23rd to 1:127.65 and 1:1.8415, respectively. It was reported that the dollar's exchange rate also rose in other major foreign exchange markets in the West.

The rise in the New York stock market and the dollar's exchange rate is due to the fact that the Chairman of the U.S. Federal Reserve, Alan Greenspan, stated in a speech this morning that the U.S. will adhere to a tight monetary policy. Financial experts believe that his speech indicates that the U.S. is determined to curb inflation and to cool down the "overheated" economy with high interest rates.

　　纽约股票大幅上涨  美元汇价回升有力
    新华社纽约１月２４日电  道·琼斯３０种工业股票平均指数今天上升３８．０４点，达２２５６．４３点，第一次超过１９８７年１０月股市暴跌前一个交易日的２２４６．７３点水平。
    今天也是这项指数自前年１０月１９日股市大跌以来升幅最大的一天。
    同一天，美元汇价也回升有力。纽约外汇市场收盘时，美元对日元和西德马克的比价分别由２３日的１∶１２７．４５和１∶１．８３１０升到１∶１２７．６５和１∶１．８４１５。据报道，美元汇价在西方其它主要外汇市场也告上扬。
    纽约股市和美元汇价上升，是因美国联邦储备委员会主席格林斯潘今天上午讲话时表示，美国将奉行紧缩银根政策。金融界人士认为，他的讲话表明，美国将决心抑制通货膨胀并以高利率使“过热”的经济降温。
