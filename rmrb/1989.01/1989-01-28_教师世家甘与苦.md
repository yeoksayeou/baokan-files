On the afternoon of January 26, the Tianjin River West District Sports Gymnasium was filled with applause.

A plaque reading "Family of Teachers" was presented to 79-year-old retired teacher Ren Bingjun. His family spans four generations with 25 members who are teachers. His father, who passed away, was a teacher at the Second Central Primary School in Hongqiao District. Five of his siblings are teachers, and his son, daughter-in-law, daughter, and son-in-law, totaling 16 people, are also teachers. Even the fourth generation has two teachers. At this moment, several of his descendants stood behind him to receive the plaque.

Taking advantage of the television crew filming in the backstage, I interviewed this family: "Mr. Ren, it's not easy to have several generations of teachers in your family! The teaching profession is noble, but it is also humble."

The spirited and youthful-looking Ren smiled:
"When I talk about being a teacher, I can say I have experienced bitterness, spiciness, sourness, and sweetness. During the warlord era, we had to pawn things to make a living. During the eight years of the Anti-Japanese War, we endured hardships. During the ten years of turmoil, I was on the brink of death. My wife once blamed me. I said: I haven't dragged you down, you can leave. She said: No, we will die together... My belief is: Our country can't always be in a state of chaos; it will eventually return to normal. As for the teaching profession, I believe that as long as there are descendants, they need to be educated. Humble conditions, I am not afraid. In terms of getting rich, I am selfless."

"Father loves calligraphy, and he gave me a couplet by Zheng Banqiao: 'Suffering is a blessing, it's hard to be foolish,'" added Ren's daughter, a Chinese language teacher at the 90th Middle School, Ren Baojin. "But we have our own joys. In my lesson plans, I once found a jasmine flower. Later, I found out it was from a student nicknamed 'Little Trouble,' who secretly placed it there to thank the teacher for her help. He really improved, and to this day, he is the first to come and pay New Year's greetings every year. There are countless New Year's cards sent from all over the country and abroad, from former students who come to chat and bless their former teacher. Seeing so many students shining and thriving in various places, we feel we have received the highest reward."

Ren continued: "Of course, teachers' salaries should be improved. But teachers should also be strictly required. A teacher influences more than 50 young people, and the responsibility is great. Teachers should be scholars and cannot be half-baked. They must not give up on moral education. From my experience, although there are still many shortcomings, we can say that education has entered a springtime."

When Ren said these words, the sports gymnasium erupted in waves of excitement. That's because there were also "Top Ten" teachers who received a house each as a reward; more than 400 young teachers were named "New Stars of Excellent Teaching" and "Gardens of Excellence." Everyone was immersed in joy.

At this moment, Mr. Ren calmly and decisively told the reporter:
"My fifth and sixth generations will also dedicate themselves to education."

### 教师世家甘与苦

　　教师世家甘与苦
    本报记者  肖荻
    １月２６日下午。天津河西区体育馆。掌声如潮。
    一幅《教师世家》横匾，授予７９岁的退休教师任秉钧。他一家共有４代２５人当教师，其父生前是红桥区第二中心小学教师，兄妹５人是教师，儿子、儿媳、女儿、女婿等１６人是教师，第４代也有２人是教师。此时，就有十几位儿女后辈跟在他后边接受赠匾。
    趁电视台在后台录像，我采访了这一家：“任老先生，您家几代当老师，可不容易呀！教师这个职业崇高，但也清苦。”
    精神奕奕、鹤发童颜的任老莞尔一笑：
    “我当教师，可以说历经苦辣酸甜。军阀年代，典当度日。八年抗战，苦煎苦熬。十年浩劫，九死一生。老伴埋怨过我。我说：不连累你啦，你走吧。她说：不，死也要死在一起……我的信念是：我们的国家不能老‘阴天’，总会恢复常态。对于教师这职业，我认为人类到什么时候都有后代，有后代就得受教育。清苦，我不怕。在致富这个问题上，我是先人后己。”
    “父亲喜书法，送给我的对联是郑板桥的两句话‘吃亏是福，难得糊涂’。”任老的女儿、９０中学语文教师任宝琴补充说：“可是，我们有我们的乐趣。在我的教案里，曾发现一朵茉莉，后来才知是个外号叫‘小淘气’的学生，为了感谢老师的帮助而偷偷放进去的。他确实变好了，直到现在，过年总抢着头一个来拜年，还有从国内国外寄来的数不清的贺年片，向昔日的老师谈心、祝福。看到这么多学生在各地发光、发热，我们就感到得了最高奖赏。”
    任老接着说：“当然，教师待遇也要提高。但是，对教师也要严格要求。一个教师影响５０多个青少年，重任在肩。教师应该是一个学者，绝不能一知半解，更不能放弃德育。以我的经历来看，现在虽然还有很多不足，但可以说是进入教育的春天。”
    任老说这番话时，体育馆里掀起阵阵高潮。那是又有“十佳”教师，获得每人一间住房的奖励；４００多位青年教师被命名为“创优课教学新秀”和“育秀园丁”。人们沉浸在欢乐中。
    这时，任老先生平静而果断地告诉记者：
    “我的第５代、第６代，还要他们投身教育。”
