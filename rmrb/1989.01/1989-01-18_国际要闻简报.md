	United States Further Reduces Military Presence in the Gulf

	Central African Republic and Israel Resume Diplomatic Relations

	The governments of the Central African Republic and Israel decided on the 16th to resume diplomatic relations.

	French Military Aircraft Withdraw from Saint Pierre and Miquelon

	Two French military aircraft left Saint Pierre and Miquelon, a French territory near Canada's Newfoundland, on the 16th, thereby easing the tension that arose in Ottawa on the 15th.

The French authorities, upon learning of this, dispatched two military aircraft carrying 60 police officers to the island.
