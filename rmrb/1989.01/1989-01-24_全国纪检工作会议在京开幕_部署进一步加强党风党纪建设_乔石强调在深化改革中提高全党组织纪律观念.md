National Discipline Inspection Work Conference Opens in Beijing
Deployment to Further Strengthen Party Discipline and Conduct
Qiao Shi Emphasizes Enhancing the Party's Organizational Discipline Awareness in Deepening Reforms

	BEIJING, Jan. 23 (Xinhua) -- Qiao Shi, a member of the Political Bureau of the CPC Central Committee and secretary of the Central Commission for Discipline Inspection, said at the opening of the National Discipline Inspection Work Conference today that discipline inspection organs at all levels should enhance their sense of urgency and responsibility. In this crucial year of rectification, adjustment, and reform, they should seize the current favorable opportunity to enhance the party's organizational discipline awareness, strengthen party discipline, and strengthen discipline inspection work to ensure the smooth implementation of the CPC Central Committee's strategic deployment.

	The conference mainly aims to summarize and exchange experiences in discipline inspection work since the 13th Party Congress, and to discuss and deploy how to further strengthen party discipline and conduct in the context of rectification, adjustment, and reform, in accordance with the principle of strict governance of the party.

	Qiao Shi said in his speech that since the Third Plenary Session of the 13th CPC Central Committee, the Party Central Committee has attached great importance to leveraging the inherent political advantages of our party, strengthening party leadership, and strengthening party building. The party's discipline awareness has been enhanced, and various regions and departments have been able to consider the overall situation, properly handle the relationship between local and overall interests, and seriously implement various measures related to rectification and adjustment. Under the leadership of party committees at all levels, supervision and inspection departments have coordinated and cooperated, with some led by discipline inspection organs, focusing on issues such as the illegal sale of important production materials, scarce durable consumer goods, monopolized commodities, and railway wagons. They have concentrated their efforts to seriously investigate and deal with a number of cases of embezzlement, bribery, abuse of power, dereliction of duty, and illegal trading, which have played an important role in reversing the situation of lax discipline, disobedience to orders, and violation of prohibitions. This has created good conditions for rectification, adjustment, and reform.

	Qiao Shi pointed out that the current situation and tasks are very favorable for us to further strengthen party discipline and improve party conduct. Since the 13th Party Congress, discipline inspection organs at all levels have clarified the guiding ideology, basic tasks, and main functions of party discipline inspection work in the new era. In accordance with the principle of separating party and government functions, they have initially sorted out their relationships with other supervision departments. In terms of seriously investigating and dealing with party disciplinary cases, assisting party committees in improving party conduct, and strengthening the construction of discipline inspection teams and discipline inspection work systems to achieve institutionalization and standardization, they have done a lot of work and achieved many results, which should be affirmed.

	Qiao Shi said that in the future, the main tasks of discipline inspection work are to further strengthen party discipline, ensure the implementation of the CPC Central Committee's decisions with strict discipline; adhere to the principle of strict governance of the party, strictly enforce party discipline, and seriously investigate and deal with party disciplinary cases; improve party conduct, maintain the cleanliness of party and government organs; strengthen discipline supervision, actively and proactively cooperate with relevant departments, and give full play to the overall effectiveness of the supervision system; and earnestly carry out the reform and institutional construction of the discipline inspection teams, so that discipline inspection work can gradually move towards a standardized and scientific track.

	At today's opening ceremony, Chen Zuolin, deputy secretary of the Central Commission for Discipline Inspection, made a report on behalf of the Standing Committee of the Central Commission for Discipline Inspection, titled "Strengthening Party Discipline Inspection Work in the Context of Comprehensive Deepening of Reforms." In his report, he reviewed the achievements and existing problems of discipline inspection work since the 13th Party Congress and made arrangements for future work.

	More than 120 people, including discipline inspection commission heads from all provinces, autonomous regions, municipalities directly under the Central Government, and municipalities with separate plans, as well as discipline inspection commissions and discipline inspection groups from the Central Government organs, the Central Government organs work committee, and the Central Military Commission, attended the conference.

    乔石强调在深化改革中提高全党组织纪律观念
    本报北京１月２３日讯  新华社记者陈雁、本报记者陈维伟报道：中共中央政治局常委、中央纪律检查委员会书记乔石在今天开幕的全国纪检工作会议上指出，各级纪检机关的干部要增强紧迫感和责任感，在治理、整顿和调整工作关键的一年中，牢牢把握住当前的有利时机，在全面深化改革中提高全党的组织纪律观念，加强党的纪律，加强纪律检查工作，保证党中央战略部署的顺利实施。
    这次会议主要是总结交流党的十三大以来纪检工作的情况和经验，按照从严治党的方针，讨论和部署在治理、整顿、调整、改革中如何进一步加强党风党纪建设的问题。
    乔石在讲话中说，党的十三届三中全会以来，党中央十分重视发挥我们党固有的政治优势，重视加强党的领导，加强党的建设。全党的纪律观念有所增强，各地区、各部门能够顾全大局，摆正局部利益与全局利益的关系，认真地贯彻治理、整顿的各项有关措施，积极以改革的精神进行调整。在各级党委的领导下，监督、检查部门协调配合，有的由纪检机关牵头，从查倒卖国家计划内重要生产资料、紧俏耐用消费品、专卖商品、铁路车皮等问题入手，集中力量认真查处了一批贪污受贿，弄权渎职，非法倒卖等案件，对扭转纪律松弛，有令不行、有禁不止的状况，起了重要的作用，为治理整顿和调整创造了良好的条件。
    乔石指出，当前的形势和任务对我们进一步严肃党纪，搞好党风建设十分有利。党的十三大以来，各级纪检机关明确了新时期党的纪检工作的指导思想、基本任务和主要职能，按照党政分开的原则，初步理顺了同其他监督部门的关系，在严肃查处党内违纪案件，协助党委抓好党风以及搞好纪检队伍自身建设和加强纪检工作制度建设，实现制度化、规范化方面，做了大量的工作，取得了不少的成绩，这是应当予以肯定的。
    乔石说，今后纪律检查工作的主要任务是，进一步加强党的纪律，以严明的纪律保证党中央决策的贯彻落实；坚持从严治党的方针，严格执行党的纪律，认真查处党内违纪案件；搞好党风建设，保持党政机关的廉洁；强化纪律监督，积极主动与有关部门协作配合，充分发挥监督体系的整体效能；切实搞好纪检队伍自身的改革和制度建设，使纪检工作逐步走上规范化、科学化的轨道。
    在今天的开幕式上，中央纪委副书记陈作霖代表中央纪委常委作了题为《在全面深化改革中加强党的纪律检查工作》的报告。他在报告中回顾了党的十三大以来纪检工作所取得的成绩和存在的问题，对今后的工作作出了部署。
    来自全国各省、自治区、直辖市及计划单列市的纪委负责人；中直机关工委、中央国家机关工委以及中央国家机关有关部委纪委、纪检组，中央军委纪委的负责人等１２０多人出席了会议。
