To enhance the competitiveness of the enterprise, China's largest copper processing enterprise—Luoyang Copper Processing Plant—has not engaged in comparisons with others. Over the past few years, they have adhered to the principle of not building grand buildings or excessively distributing bonuses and gifts. Instead, they have educated their employees to live frugally even in prosperous times, concentrating all financial resources to accelerate technological progress and strengthen the enterprise's development potential. Since 1986, the plant has not relied on state allocations, raising 150 million yuan on its own to carry out major technological renovations on two key production lines throughout the factory. This has significantly transformed the factory's appearance, bringing the quality and performance of its products to the advanced international standards of the 1980s.

Luoyang Copper Processing Plant is one of the 156 key construction projects of China's First Five-Year Plan and is also one of the 40 largest copper processing enterprises in the world today. It currently employs nearly 10,000 workers. Over the 20-plus years since its operation, the factory's technological equipment has become increasingly outdated, production processes have fallen behind, energy consumption and material consumption are high, and product quality is far below international standards, failing to meet the needs of national key projects and the Four Modernizations.

Facing this situation, the factory leadership recognized the need for timely technological renovation of the enterprise to continue leveraging the advantages of a large factory with higher technological standards, adapting to the new situation of "both ends open." In April 1986, the factory launched a full-scale mobilization, calling on everyone to tighten their belts for a few years, save every penny, and work together to successfully complete the copper strip and aluminum strip technological renovation projects. The profits reduced during the old production line renovation were made up by the workers through double increases and double savings. The more self-raised funds the enterprise had, the more the enterprise bonuses and welfare were temporarily affected, but the workers all put the overall situation first and had no complaints. They also actively contributed ideas for the factory's production and technological renovation. In just one year, all the workers in the factory submitted more than 1,000 rationalization suggestions, creating economic value of more than 2.4 million yuan.

　　洛阳铜加工厂富日子当紧日子过
    ３年自筹资金１．５亿元，完成两项重大技术改造工程
    本报讯  记者张国荣报道：为了提高企业的竞争能力，我国最大的铜加工企业——洛阳铜加工厂，不与别人攀比，几年来，他们坚持不盖楼堂馆所，不滥发奖金实物，而是教育职工把富日子当穷日子过，集中一切财力，加快企业技术进步，增强企业发展后劲。自１９８６年以来，这个厂不要国家拨款，自筹资金１．５亿元，对全厂两条关键生产线进行了重大技术改造，一举改变工厂面貌，使产品质量、性能达到８０年代国际先进水平。
    洛阳铜加工厂是我国“一五”期间１５６项重点建设工程之一，也是当前世界上４０个最大的铜加工企业之一。现有职工近万人。投产２０多年来，工厂的技术装备日显陈旧，生产工艺日趋落后，能耗大，物耗大，产品质量大大低于国际水平，已不能满足国家重点工程和四化建设的需要。
    面对这种形势，厂领导认识到，必须适时地进行企业技术改造，以更高的技术水平继续发挥大厂的优势，适应“两头在外”的新形势。１９８６年４月该厂实行全厂总动员，号召大家勒紧裤带过几年紧日子，节约每一分钱，齐心协力搞好工厂铜板带和铝板带两大技术改造工程。老生产线改造时减少的利润，职工们通过双增双节补回来。自筹资金多，企业奖金福利暂时受到影响，职工们也都能以大局为重，毫无怨言，还积极为工厂生产和技术改造献计献策。仅去年１年，全厂职工共提合理化建议１０００多条，创造经济价值２４０多万元。
