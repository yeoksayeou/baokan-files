The Agricultural Bank of Penglai County in Shandong Province, despite facing severe credit fund shortages, has overcome numerous difficulties to concentrate funds on supporting agriculture. In the fourth quarter of 1988, by adjusting the investment structure, the bank recovered and reduced excessive loans to rural enterprises by over 460 million yuan, investing them into agricultural production. This action has alleviated the shortage of funds for agricultural production.

The peak season for purchasing agricultural and sideline products has increased the demand for funds. To address this, the bank fully utilized the favorable opportunity of the state raising savings interest rates, strengthened services, and mobilized all staff to go to the streets, rural areas, and factories to extensively raise idle social funds. This timely reversed the declining trend in savings, with urban savings alone increasing by over 186 million yuan in the fourth quarter of 1988. This not only eased the tight credit fund situation but also prepared for increasing agricultural credit fund investments.

The Agricultural Bank of Penglai has prioritized the relationship between industry and agriculture, adopting encouraging and preferential policies for agriculture. Loans for land improvement, purchasing agricultural machinery, fertilizers, high-quality seeds, and constructing water conservancy facilities are all given priority. Since adjusting the credit structure, the proportion of agricultural loans has increased from 8.1% of the total rural loans to 38.9%, creating conditions for agricultural development. Farmers have commented, "In recent years, the Agricultural Bank, which was busy supporting the development of rural enterprises, has once again opened its doors to agriculture. Agricultural production has finally regained its proper position."

　　调整信贷结构　开门面向农户
    蓬莱农行集中资金支持农田建设
    本报讯  山东蓬莱县农业银行在信贷资金十分紧张的情况下，克服种种困难，集中资金支持农业。１９８８年第四季度，通过调整投资结构，共压缩收回乡村企业超额贷款４６０多万元投入农业生产，缓和了农业生产资金不足的矛盾。
    农副产品收购旺季扩大了对于资金的需求，为此，这个行充分利用国家调高储蓄利率的有利时机，加强服务，发动全行干部职工走上街头，深入农村、厂矿，广泛筹集社会闲散资金，及时扭转了储蓄“滑坡”的局面，１９８８年第四季度，仅城镇储蓄一项就增加１８６０多万元，不仅缓和了信贷资金“吃紧”的情况，也为增加农业信贷资金投入，做好了准备。
    蓬莱农行摆正工农业关系，对农业采取鼓励和优惠政策。凡用于改良修整土地，购买农机、化肥、良种和修建水利设施等方面的贷款一律优先发放，这个行自调整信贷结构以来，农业贷款比例由过去占整个农村贷款的８．１％上升到３８．９％，为发展农业创造条件。农民们反映，“这几年忙于支持乡村企业发展的农行大门，又向农业敞开了。农业生产终于又摆上了正位”。
