The key tasks for legal and political work over the next two years have been determined: to maintain a stable political environment, severely crack down on serious criminal activities and serious economic crimes, and create a stable social environment for deepening reforms and economic development. This will provide strong legal guarantees and timely, effective legal services.

The national conference on legal and political work, held in Beijing and concluding today, emphasized that maintaining a stable and united political environment, severely cracking down on serious criminal activities and serious economic crimes, and creating a stable social environment for deepening reforms and economic development are the main tasks for legal and political work over the next two years. This will provide strong legal guarantees and timely, effective legal services.

The conference, convened by the Central Leading Group for Legal and Political Work, began on January 12. Qiao Shi, a member of the Political Bureau of the CPC Central Committee and head of the Central Leading Group for Legal and Political Work, presided over the meeting and delivered a speech.

In reviewing the achievements of legal and political work, the conference noted that over the past two years, various departments have continuously launched various special campaigns to severely crack down on serious criminal activities and serious economic crimes. They have actively promoted comprehensive social governance, properly handled various emergencies, and timely suppressed riots instigated by a few nationalist separatists, maintaining basic social stability. Various levels of legal and political departments have used various legal means to participate in the regulation of economic relations and the maintenance of economic order, providing a large amount of legal guarantees and legal services for the smooth progress of economic system reform and economic development. Broad masses of legal and political cadres have overcome various difficulties, faithfully performed their duties, and made significant contributions to the interests of the Party and the people.

The conference analyzed the current social instability factors and social security situation, noting that there are many difficulties and problems at present, and the situation facing the legal and political front is quite severe. The conference stressed that the current focus of cracking down on serious criminal activities is on murderers, robbers, rapists, drug traffickers, major thieves, criminals who assault and retaliate against enterprise leaders and law enforcement personnel, roaming criminals, leaders of criminal gangs, human traffickers, those who force, lure, or harbor women into prostitution, and gambling ringleaders. Public security organs, procuratorates, and courts must work closely together to suppress the arrogance of criminals.

The conference emphasized that in cracking down on serious economic crimes, the main efforts should be focused on combating corruption and bribery. For serious economic crimes, the principle of strict punishment according to law must be adhered to; for economic criminal cases with clear evidence, they must be resolutely investigated and dealt with without leniency. The phenomenon of weak crackdowns must be prevented and corrected. A number of corrupt and bribery criminals who have aroused public indignation must be severely punished according to law, reducing corruption and bribery crimes to the lowest possible level.

The conference stressed that the fundamental way to solve social security problems lies in comprehensive governance.

The conference proposed that judicial organs must resolutely overcome various obstacles, base themselves on facts, adhere to the law, handle cases impartially, strictly enforce the law, and seriously investigate every case accepted. In handling economic criminal cases, the phenomenon of "punishment instead of criminal prosecution" must be overcome. All levels of party and government leaders and all law enforcement departments must consider the overall situation, overcome departmentalism, and strictly act according to national laws.

The conference emphasized that maintaining clean governance should be an important part of strict management of the police force and should be a professional ethics for all cadres. All levels of leading cadres must set an example of integrity. The core role and fortress role of party organizations at all levels within the legal and political forces must be fully brought into play, discipline must be strictly enforced, and ideological and political work must be strengthened. Legal and political departments must regularly conduct inspections of law enforcement and discipline, and establish a system to persist in this. Any violations of law and discipline must be promptly and seriously investigated and dealt with without leniency. At the same time, supervision mechanisms must be strengthened from all aspects to further increase the transparency of legal and political work, so as to gain the supervision, understanding, and support of the broad masses of the people.

Members of the Central Leading Group for Legal and Political Work, Wang Fang, Liu Fuzhi, Ren Jianxin, Jia Chunwang, Cai Cheng, and Zhou Wenyuan, as well as the heads of the departments in charge of legal and political work in various provinces, autonomous regions, and municipalities directly under the Central Committee, the heads of the legal and political leading organs, the heads of the legal and political leading groups and the legal and political departments of the various military regions and military branches of the PLA, and the heads of the central legal and political departments and relevant departments attended the conference.

　　政法工作确定今明两年主要任务
    严惩严重刑事和经济犯罪活动
    据新华社北京一月十九日电  （记者邹爱国、杨国钧）今天在北京闭会的全国政法工作座谈会提出：维护安定团结的政治局面，严厉打击严重刑事犯罪活动和严重经济犯罪活动，为全面深化改革和经济建设创造安定的社会环境，提供有力的法律保障和及时有效的法律服务，是今明两年政法工作的主要任务。
    由中央政法领导小组召开的这次座谈会是一月十二日开始举行的。中共中央政治局常委、中央政法领导小组组长乔石主持了会议，并在会上讲了话。
    会议在回顾政法工作的成绩时认为，近两年来，政法各部门持续开展各种专项斗争，严厉打击严重刑事犯罪活动和严重经济犯罪活动，积极推进社会治安综合治理，妥善处理各种突发事件，及时平息由极少数民族分裂主义分子策动的骚乱，保持了社会治安的基本稳定。各级政法部门运用各种法律手段，参与调节经济关系，维护经济秩序，为经济体制改革和经济建设的顺利进行，做了大量的法律保障和法律服务工作。广大政法干警克服种种困难，忠实履行职责，为党和人民的利益作出了重大贡献。
    会议分析当前社会存在的不安定因素和社会治安情况时认为，当前困难和问题不少，政法战线面临的形势也相当严峻。会议强调，当前打击严重刑事犯罪活动的重点是：杀人犯，抢劫犯，强奸犯，贩毒犯，重大盗窃犯，行凶报复企业领导人和执法人员的罪犯，流窜犯罪分子，犯罪团伙的头子，人贩子，强迫、引诱、容留妇女卖淫犯，赌头赌棍等。公安机关、检察院、法院要密切配合，把犯罪分子的嚣张气焰打下去。
    会议认为，在打击严重经济犯罪活动中，要把主要力量放在反贪污、反受贿上。对于严重经济犯罪活动，必须坚持依法从严惩处的方针；对于证据确凿的经济违法犯罪案件，要坚决查处，决不手软，要防止和纠正打击不力的现象。要依法严惩一批民愤很大的贪污犯、受贿犯，把贪污、受贿犯罪减少到最低限度。
    会议强调，产生社会治安问题有其复杂的社会原因，解决治安问题的根本途径，还在于进行全面综合治理。
    会议提出，司法机关必须坚决排除各种阻力，以事实为根据，以法律为准绳，秉公办案，严肃执法，认真查处受理的每一起案件。在处理经济违法犯罪案件中，要克服“以罚代刑”等现象。各级党政领导和所有执法部门都要顾全大局，克服本位主义，严格依照国家法律办事。
    会议强调，要把为政清廉列为从严治警的重要内容，并作为全体干警的职业道德。各级领导干部要做廉洁的表率。要充分发挥政法队伍中各级党组织的核心作用和战斗堡垒作用，严格纪律，大力加强思想政治工作。政法部门要定期开展遵纪执法大检查，并形成制度，持之以恒。发现违法乱纪问题，必须及时严肃查处，决不姑息。同时要从各方面加强监督机制，进一步增加政法工作的透明度，以取得广大人民群众的监督、理解和支持。
    中央政法领导小组成员王芳、刘复之、任建新、贾春旺、蔡诚、周文元，各省、自治区、直辖市党委分管政法工作的负责同志和政法领导机构的负责同志，各大军区、各军兵种政法领导小组和解放军政法各部门的负责同志，中央政法各部门和有关部门的负责同志出席了座谈会。
