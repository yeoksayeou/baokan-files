Since the establishment of the National Audit Office in September 1983, audit agencies at various levels have been working while being set up. They have audited approximately 400,000 units. By the end of November 1988, a total of 46.8 billion yuan in violations of financial discipline were uncovered. Of this amount, 11.9 billion yuan should be turned over to the treasury, with 7.2 billion yuan already turned over; 2.4 billion yuan in various special funds that were misappropriated should be recovered. A total of 3,651 cases involving violations of over 10 million yuan were handled, and 675 cases of embezzlement involving over 1 million yuan were handled. A total of 2,070 violators were disciplined by the Party and the government, and 2,111 individuals were handed over to judicial authorities for processing. In addition, some enterprises' losses and waste, economic benefits, and the use of international financial organization loans and aid projects were also audited.

It is understood that audit agencies have now been established in more than 3,000 counties and above at various levels of government in China, with over 50,000 audit personnel.
