    Chairman of the Committee for the Peaceful Reunification of the Fatherland, Ri Jong-uk, pointed out that federalism is the foundation for Korean unification.

    Our reporter, Xu Baokang, reported from Pyongyang on January 5: Member of the Political Bureau of the Central Committee of the Workers' Party of Korea, Secretary, and Chairman of the Committee for the Peaceful Reunification of the Fatherland, Ri Jong-uk, issued a written statement on January 4, pointing out that the North-South Political Consultative Conference has the possibility of fully reaching mutual understanding on the issue of realizing Korean unification through federalism.

    In his written statement, Ri Jong-uk pointed out that under the condition of the coexistence of two different social systems in the North and the South, there is no better unification plan than realizing federalism and establishing a unified state. The idea of realizing Korean unification through federalism not only resonates with the people of South Korea and the opposition parties and forces in South Korea, but even the South Korean authorities do not dare to outright reject it. The North firmly believes that the federal unification plan will become the basis for the entire nation to fully reach an understanding. If the North and the South set aside their differences in ideology, system, and political views, subordinate everything to the cause of unification, and seriously consult on the issue of realizing federalism, they will definitely find the best unification plan on the basis of mutual understanding between the two sides.

    Ri Jong-uk said that Chairman Kim Il-sung's proposal in his New Year's address to convene a North-South Political Consultative Conference reflects the will and voice of the people of all strata in the North and the South at this stage and is the most reasonable measure to save the country as soon as possible.

    Our reporter, Xu Baokang, reported from Pyongyang on January 6: Today, the Rodong Sinmun of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea published a commentary calling on South Korea to stop holding this year's "Team Spirit" joint military exercises.

    The commentary said that at present, the dialogue and consultation between the North and the South of Korea have put the holding of high-level political and military talks, sports talks, and student talks between the North and the South on the agenda. If the North and the South do not take effective measures to eliminate confrontation and improve the relationship between the North and the South, any dialogue and consultation to improve the relationship between the North and the South will not be able to proceed smoothly. The commentary said that holding the "Team Spirit" joint military exercises can only escalate the tension in Korea and bring huge obstacles to dialogue and unification.

　　朝和平统一委员会委员长许锬指出
    联邦制是朝鲜统一的基础
    本报平壤１月５日电  记者徐宝康报道：朝鲜党中央政治局委员、书记，祖国和平统一委员会委员长许锬４日发表书面谈话指出，北南政治协商会议在商讨以联邦制实现朝鲜统一问题上，充分达成相互谅解的可能性。
    许锬在书面谈话中指出，在北南两种不同社会制度共存的条件下，没有比实现联邦制，建立统一国家更好的统一方案了。以联邦制实现朝鲜统一的设想，不仅在南朝鲜人民和南朝鲜在野党及在野势力中引起共鸣，甚至连南朝鲜当局也不敢断然拒绝。北方坚信，联邦制统一方案将成为全民族充分达成谅解的基础，如果北南摒弃双方在思想、制度和政见上的分歧，一切服从于统一大业，并就实现联邦制问题进行认真协商的话，一定会在双方相互谅解的基础上，找出最佳统一方案。
    许锬说，金日成主席在新年献词中提出的召开北南政治协商会议的建议，反映了现阶段北南各阶层人民的意志和呼声，是早日解决统一问题的最合理的救国措施。
    本报平壤１月６日电　记者徐宝康报道：朝鲜《劳动新闻》今天发表评论，呼吁南朝鲜停止举行今年的“协作精神”联合军事演习。
    评论说，目前朝鲜北南之间的对话与协商，已把举行北南高级政治军事会谈、体育会谈、学生会谈提到议事日程。北南之间如果不采取消除对峙的有效措施，改善北南关系的任何对话和协商都将无法得以顺利进行。评论说，举行“协作精神”联合军事演习，只能加剧朝鲜的紧张局势，给对话和统一带来巨大障碍。
