On the eve of the New Year, I came to the former floodplain of the Yellow River in eastern Henan with a heart full of excitement, revisiting a humble village here—Chukou Village in Tongxu County.

Half a century ago, a man-made Yellow River flood turned 54,000 square kilometers of land in Henan, Anhui, and Jiangsu into a vast expanse of water, claiming the lives of 890,000 people. Chukou Village, south of Kaifeng, was one of the villages swept away by the Yellow River's turbulent waters.

Nine years after the floodwaters receded, in the winter of 1947, I followed the Third Field Army of the People's Liberation Army to Chukou Village. The village marked on the map had vanished from the ground, and all that remained were rolling sand dunes. In some places, a few tree branches and rooftops poked out, covered with wild grass. We struggled to find a half-buried house at the village entrance, with only the upper half exposed. We squeezed through the window and managed to settle in.

In this makeshift shelter, I accidentally found a handwritten manuscript made of homemade paper. The dusty cover had four neat characters written in ink: "Yun Window Accumulated Oddities." The author, Dai Hong'an, was a teacher from the village and the owner of this destroyed house. The book recorded in the style of the "Three Character Classic" the tragic experience of his family being separated during the 1938 flood when the Kuomintang army breached the Huangdi Dike at Huayuankou, sweeping through eastern Henan. The text was heart-wrenching, filled with tears of sorrow and indignation. Under the dim oil lamp, I read this firsthand account of the great tragedy in the floodplain, and outside, the north wind howled, as if echoing the cries of millions of sufferers. This scene has remained in my memory for 40 years.

This time, revisiting Chukou Village, the car sped along a smooth asphalt road, with rows of poplar trees lining both sides, a characteristic of the floodplain. As we approached Chukou Village, the sound of bustling voices came from a distance. It turned out to be market day, with the road filled with farmers and vehicles. On both sides were various stalls selling vegetables, meat, eggs, and other agricultural products, as well as daily necessities. The aroma of local flatbread wafted through the air, and a few young people had set up small oil presses and flour mills, with machines rumbling. In the distance, the sounds of cattle and donkeys braying could be heard from the livestock market on the village outskirts. The lively rural market scene made it hard to believe that this was the same village that was on the brink of destruction 40 years ago.

I went to look for Dai Hong'an's family. The half-buried house was gone, replaced by four rows of new brick houses. Unfortunately, the teacher who survived the disaster had already passed away. I met his son, Dai Guanglu, who worked at the village supply and marketing cooperative. His family contracted 14 mu of land, raised two cows and two sheep, and planted about a hundred trees. The four new rooms were built in 1986, furnished with all the necessary items, and even had a sofa, a rare piece of furniture in rural areas, indicating a harmonious family.

The village party secretary, Pu Jiancang, who was already in his sixties, tall and thin, came to meet me. His back was slightly hunched, his face wrinkled, and his hair white, making him look aged. When his parents escaped the flood, he was just a naked child. At 18, he followed his parents back to the devastated hometown with a load of rags, starting a difficult life by building a thatched hut on the sand dunes. After liberation, he had a comfortable life for a while, but soon, like many rural areas in Henan, the endless turmoil began, turning the village that had just recovered from the disaster upside down. By 1978, the per capita grain ration was less than 90 jin, and a day's labor earned only 9 to 12 fen. Their life was: "Sweet potato soup, sweet potato bread, can't live without sweet potatoes."

By September 1978, two years after the fall of the "Gang of Four," Pu Jiancang could no longer bear the poverty of drinking sweet potato soup every day. One day, he mustered his courage to visit the commune secretary, proposing to implement the responsibility system in the village, allocating 200 mu of land to each household as "grain fields." The commune secretary shook his head: "Old Pu, you can't do that!" Pu Jiancang, who had been the production team accountant, had done the math. He told the commune secretary that Chukou Village had never completed the state grain quota and had to rely on relief. If he were allowed to implement the responsibility system, he would guarantee the grain quota for the next year. The commune secretary remained silent. Pu Jiancang understood that this was tacit approval. Back in the village, he started working with everyone, dividing the land and livestock, and each household planted wheat on their responsibility fields. Indeed, Pu Jiancang's calculations were correct. The next year, there was a bumper wheat harvest, and the village made headlines by selling 65,000 jin of wheat to the state, completing the grain quota in one season, surprising and delighting the county and commune officials. In the autumn, they sold another 150,000 jin of sweet potatoes to the state, increasing the per capita grain ration to 120 jin of wheat, and sweet potatoes were no longer the main staple. Someone composed a new rhyme: "White flour soup, white flour bread, sweet potato cakes exchanged for wine to drink." Since then, the farmers of Chukou Village have taken bold steps forward.

Ten years ago, the wheat yield per mu in Chukou Village had never exceeded 100 jin. In recent years, it has reached 200 jin. Last year, despite a severe drought, the yield was over 150 jin per mu.

The old party secretary and a few villagers led me around the village, explaining everything along the way. The village had over 300 households, and almost every household had cows and sheep tied in front, with piles of firewood. The old thatched huts that could barely shield the wind and rain were gone, replaced by uniform brick houses. Trees were planted everywhere in front of and behind the houses, and inside and outside the village. I had rarely seen a village with such dense tree cover. Tongxu County is one of the advanced counties in national plain afforestation, with an average of 58 trees per person. It seemed that Chukou Village would exceed this number. The village had a saying: "To get rich, plant trees and raise pigs." According to statistics, the current value of the interplanted timber in the village alone was 1.5 million yuan.

I asked Pu Jiancang if the village's water problem had been solved. I remembered that the biggest difficulty in the floodplain at that time was the lack of water. The returning farmers found the old wells, dug out the sand, and used ropes several zhang long to draw a small bucket of water. When I mentioned this, everyone laughed. Now, Chukou Village no longer worries about water. In recent years, the entire village has worked hard on water conservancy, with each household investing over 1,000 yuan on average to drill 207 wells, and purchasing 106 walk-behind tractors. The irrigation system is complete and interconnected, with ditches and rivers communicating.

They also took me to visit the village's two major buildings: the school building and the cinema, both built with funds raised by the villagers. The school has junior and primary sections, with nearly 500 students and 29 teachers. The cinema is the pride of the villagers of Chukou. Last year, they even "invited" famous Yu Opera performers from Kaifeng City, causing a sensation throughout the township.

The villagers of Chukou have both joys and worries. They are delighted that in ten years, they have finally bid farewell to the poverty of several generations and are living a life that their ancestors could not imagine—every household has surplus grain, and many have bicycles, watches, sewing machines, and over 40 households have televisions. Their worries are the decreasing arable land, rising prices of agricultural production materials, and the low prices of agricultural products. Although the village is full of vibrant scenes, it is also evident that this place is not yet rich; it has only reached the level of basic subsistence with a slight surplus.

The historical mistakes have made this village on the south bank of the Yellow River pay a heavy price. Now, the villagers of Chukou, with unyielding perseverance, have rebuilt their homes from the ruins. Perhaps it can be said that Chukou Village is a microcosm of the thousands of households in the floodplain that have risen from the disaster.

　　重访蒲口集
    本报记者  季音
    新年前夕，我怀着激奋的心情，来到昔日的豫东黄泛区，重访这里的一个普通村庄——通许县蒲口集。
    半个世纪前，一场人为的黄河洪灾，使豫、皖、苏５．４万平方公里土地成为汪洋，８９万人惨遭死亡。开封以南的通许县蒲口集，就是当年被卷进黄河浊浪的村庄之一。
    洪水退去的第９年，即１９４７年冬，我曾经随着人民解放军第三野战军到过蒲口集。这个地图上标着“蒲口集”的村子已在地面消失，眼前只有一片起伏的沙丘，有的地方伸出几枝树梢，露出几处屋顶，瓦上荒草萋萋。我们好不容易在村头找到一间下半截已埋进黄沙，只有上层露出地面的危房，钻窗而入，勉强住下。
    在这间“住室”里，我偶然看到了一本用土造纸订成的手写稿，满是灰尘的封面上写着“芸窗积异”４个正楷毛笔字，手稿作者戴鸿安，是本村一个教书先生，这座被毁住宅的主人。书中用“三字经”形式记述了１９３８年６月国民党军队扒开花园口黄河大堤，洪水席卷豫东，他一家妻离子散的凄惨经历，文字凄切，悲愤之泪洒满纸上。在暗淡的油灯下，我翻读着这份黄泛区大悲剧的亲身实录，室外朔风呼啸，仿佛那就是泛区千万受难者的呼号。这一幕我４０年未曾忘怀。
    这次重访蒲口集，汽车沿着平坦的柏油路奔驰，公路两旁尽是黄泛区特有的绵延不断的泡桐林。走近蒲口集，不远处传来了喧嚷的人声，原来正逢赶集，大路上挤满赶集的农民和车辆，两旁是各式各样的货摊，有出售蔬菜、肉蛋等农产品的，出售日用百货的，豫东特有的烧饼炉飘出阵阵香味，几个青年人开办的小型榨油厂与面粉加工厂里机器轰鸣，远处，还不时传来村边牲口市场上牛驴的嗷叫。眼前这个热气腾腾的农村集市，使我难以置信它就是４０年前那个濒于毁灭的村庄。
    我去寻访戴鸿安的家。那座半截埋在沙里的楼房已经不见，旧址上盖起了四排新砖房，遗憾的是，那个劫后余生的乡村教师早已离世。见到了老教师的儿子戴广禄，他在本村供销社做事，家里承包了１４亩地，养了两头牛和两只羊，栽了百来株树。４间新屋是１９８６年才盖的，房间里摆设齐全，居然还有沙发之类的农村稀有家具，看来是一个和美的农家。
    年已花甲、高高瘦瘦的村党支部书记蒲建堂闻讯赶来。他背微驼，满脸皱纹，一头白发，显得苍老。当年，父辈从洪水里逃生时，他还是个光腚孩子，１８岁那年跟着父母挑了一担破烂，从陈留回到劫后的家乡，在沙丘边搭个草棚，开始了艰难生活。解放后他有过很舒坦日子，但没有多久，如同河南许多农村那样，开始了没完没了的折腾，把刚从灾难里站起的蒲口集又弄得锅底朝天。１９７８年，全村人均口粮不到９０斤，一个劳动日只有９分到１角２分钱，他们的生活是：“红薯汤，红薯馍，离了红薯不能活。”
    到１９７８年９月，“四人帮”覆没后两年，蒲建堂再也不能忍受整天喝红薯汤的穷日子。一天，他壮着胆跑去找公社书记，提出要在村里搞责任制，划２００亩地给各户作“口粮田”。公社书记听了直摇头：“老蒲，你可不能胡来！”当过生产队会计的蒲建堂算过一笔账，他一五一十告诉公社书记，蒲口集年年完不成国家公粮任务，还要吃救济，如果让他搞责任田，明年的公粮就包在他身上。公社书记听了不吱声。老蒲明白，这是书记默许了。回到村里，他就和大伙干了起来，分了地，分了牲口，各家各户在责任田上种下了麦子。果然，蒲建堂的账算得正确。第二年小麦大丰收，多年穷村爆出了一次卖给国家麦子６．５万公斤的大新闻，公粮任务一季完成，使县社干部又惊又喜。秋季，又卖给国家红薯１５万公斤，村里人均口粮增加到１２０公斤小麦，不再把红薯作主粮了。有人编了新的顺口溜：“白面汤，白面馍，红薯干子换酒喝”。从此蒲口集农民放胆地甩开了大步。
    １０年前，蒲口集麦子单产从未超过１００公斤，这几年已达到２００公斤，去年是少见的大旱，亩产１５０多公斤。
    老支书和几个老乡领着我在村里四处转悠，一边走一边细说。村里有３００多户人家，户户门前几乎都拴着牛羊，堆着许多木料。过去那种难遮风雨的草棚不见了，全是一式新砖瓦房；屋前屋后，村里村外处处栽树。我很少见过树木如此密集的村庄。通许县是全国平原绿化的先进县之一，全县人均拥有树５８棵，看来蒲口集要超过这个数目。村里有句顺口溜：“若要富，栽树养母猪。”据统计，眼下本村仅可间伐木材就值１５０万元。
    我问蒲建堂，如今村上的喝水问题可曾解决了？我记得，当年黄泛区最大困难就是缺水，逃荒归来的农民找到旧水井，掏出泥沙，用几丈长的绳子才能汲上一小桶水。当我谈到这些，人们都笑了。现在蒲口集不再愁水了，近几年全村发狠建水利，每户平均投资１０００余元，打了２０７眼机井，还买了１０６台手扶拖拉机，灌溉系统做到了配套成龙，沟河相通。
    他们又让我去参观了村里的两大建筑物：村办学校楼和影剧院，都是农民集资建的，学校有初中、小学两部分，有近５００名学生与２９位老师。影剧院是蒲口农民的骄傲，去年他们居然“搬”来了开封市的豫剧名演员，轰动全乡。
    蒲口农民有欢乐也有烦恼。他们欢欣的是十年间终于告别了几代的贫穷，过上了前辈难以想象的生活——户户有余粮，还有自行车，手表，缝纫机，４０多户有了电视机。烦恼的是耕地日益减少，农业生产资料涨价，农产品价格偏低。尽管村里到处可见生机勃勃的景象，但同样看得出，此地还说不上富裕，只能说达到了温饱，稍有节余。
    历史的过失使这个黄河南岸的村庄付出了沉重代价。如今蒲口农民以百折不回的毅力在废墟上重建了家园。——或许可以说，蒲口集就是千家万户从灾难里崛起的黄泛区农庄的缩影。
