The "pharmaceutical king of Bozhou," Liu Donghai, a young Hui man, has not forgotten the country as he has grown wealthy. Since 1985, he has voluntarily paid over 200,000 yuan in taxes.

Bozhou City in Anhui Province is the hometown of the famous physician Hua Tuo from the Eastern Han Dynasty and one of the "Four Great Pharmaceutical Cities" in the country. Liu Donghai is the chairman of the Bozhou City Pharmaceutical Association. He believes that private entrepreneurs voluntarily paying taxes has three meanings: First, the Party's policy of enriching the people has allowed private entrepreneurs to become wealthy first, and private entrepreneurs should repay the Party and the government with gratitude. Second, evading taxes will result in legal penalties, while law-abiding operations can gain the support of tax, industrial and commercial, banking, and other departments, making it easier to do big business. Third, voluntarily paying taxes helps to establish a good "corporate image," enhancing the company's reputation and authority.

At 38 years old, Liu Donghai was only able to make a living by doing small, low-profit businesses like slaughtering chickens and sheep nine years ago. He was so poor that his door was never locked, yet no one would steal from him. He started learning the business of buying and selling traditional Chinese medicines in early 1980, and his business became increasingly prosperous. In 1985, his sales volume first exceeded the 10 million yuan mark. In 1987, he paid 61,000 yuan in taxes, and in the first 11 months of 1988, he paid over 70,000 yuan in taxes.

　　“亳州药王”刘东海主动纳税２０万元
    本报讯  被誉为亳州“药材大王”的回族青年刘东海致富不忘国家，自１９８５年以来，已主动缴纳税金２０万余元。
    安徽省亳州市是东汉神医华佗的故乡、全国“四大药都”之一。刘东海是亳州市药业协会理事长。他认为私营企业主动纳税有三方面的意义：一是党的富民政策让私营业主先富起来，私营业主对党和政府应当知恩报恩。二是偷税漏税要受到依法制裁，而守法经营能够得到税务、工商、银行等部门的支持，才好做成大生意。三是主动纳税有助于树立良好的“企业形象”，提高企业知名度和威信。
    今年３８岁的刘东海，９年前仅靠做点杀鸡宰羊之类薄本微利的小生意勉强养家糊口，穷得家门不锁也没人进去偷。他自１９８０年初开始学做中药材购销生意，生意越做越红火，１９８５年经销额首次突破百万元大关。１９８７年他纳税６．１万元，１９８８年的前１１个月纳税７万多元。　　　（孙剑云）
