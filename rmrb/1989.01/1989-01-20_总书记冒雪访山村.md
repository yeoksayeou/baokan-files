On the morning of January 10, snowflakes were falling over the central plains.

Accompanied by Yang Xie, Secretary of the Henan Provincial Committee of the Communist Party of China, and Governor Cheng Weigao, General Secretary Zhao Ziyang traveled by minivan from Zhengzhou to Gongxian Xiaoguan Township's Zhulin Village, a model for "two civilizations" construction in Henan Province.

The car stopped in Zhulin Village. Zhao Ziyang saw tall factory buildings and rows of new brick houses, and he smiled. Village Party Branch Secretary Zhao Ming'en and Village Committee Director Li Shuzhuan were completely taken aback that the General Secretary would visit on such a snowy day. They joyfully took his hand and led him into the meeting room.

Zhao Ziyang sat down with the village cadres, took a cup of tea, and began chatting with them. He inquired in detail about the production and living conditions of the villagers in Zhulin Village: how much land there was, whether the grain supply was sufficient, whether there were any difficulties with water, whether most households had moved into new houses, whether preschool children could all attend school, whether every household had a television, and whether villagers could watch a movie every month. Listening to the cadres' responses, he nodded repeatedly.

Zhulin is a large mountain village in Xiaoguan Township. Six mountains and six gullies are home to five natural villages and over 400 households. In the past, the area was plagued by high mountains, thin soil, and a severe lack of water, resulting in long-term poverty. By 1980, the village's total industrial and agricultural output value was only 900,000 yuan, with a per capita income of 79 yuan. In June 1983, Zhao Ming'en, who was skilled in technology and management, was elected as the village Party Branch Secretary. He led the villagers to utilize local resources, develop sideline industries, and pursue a path of hard work and prosperity. The village successively established 17 factories and mines, including small coal mines, refractory brick factories, chemical plants, and pharmaceutical factories, forming a situation where collective economy is the mainstay, and individual cooperative economy is supplementary, with various economic forms developing in parallel. Last year, the output value reached 21 million yuan, with 840,000 yuan in taxes paid to the state, and a per capita income of 1,250 yuan. In recent years, there have been no criminal cases, and no incidents of feudal superstition, gambling, fighting, or overpopulation and early marriage.

"How did you develop to this point?" Zhao Ziyang asked.

Zhao Ming'en told the General Secretary about the detour they took after developing commodity production. Around 1982, the village established several factories, and the economy developed, with more bonuses. However, ideological work was relaxed. Some Party members and cadres only cared about making money for themselves, and the villagers had no one to turn to for help. The village couldn't even hold a meeting. The Party organization was no longer effective. Several villagers were sent to labor reeducation for committing crimes, and all the Party members and cadres in the village were heartbroken. In 1985, at the village Party members' meeting, the guiding ideology of "developing the economy on one hand and strengthening ideological work on the other, leading the villagers to the path of common prosperity" was established. This is like our village's "Number One Document"! Since then, we have strengthened ideological and political work, promoted learning, heart-to-heart talks, and commendations. The village evaluates and commends good Party members, good Young Pioneers, good youth, good militiamen, good daughters-in-law, good daughters, and good families every year, and gives them due recognition. People highly value this spiritual encouragement. The village's good daughters-in-law are taken home in a decorated car, with a brass band playing and blowing, and both the in-laws and the natal family are as happy as if celebrating a festival. When it is truly valued, the village's atmosphere changes in a couple of years.

Zhao Ziyang asked, "How do the Party members and cadres in your village play their roles?"

Village Committee Director Li Shuzhuan introduced that Zhulin Village has 74 Party members, a small number among the 2,107 people in the village, but their influence is significant. The Party Branch requires Party members and cadres to put hard work first and benefits later. Once the Party members set an example, the villagers follow. The village regulations stipulate that for road and house construction, villagers contribute 5 days of labor per year, while Party members contribute 12 days. According to the village's regulations, the Branch Secretary and Village Committee Director can earn 530 yuan per month for their official duties, but they only take 200 yuan and 150 yuan respectively, earning less but working harder. Once, when the village's refractory bricks were being fired, the power suddenly went out, making it impossible to ventilate and cool down. The honest Zhulin people had to deliver the bricks to the buyers according to the contract. At the critical moment, the Branch Secretary and several Party cadres wrapped themselves in wet cotton-padded clothes and shoes, and crawled into the hot kiln. The villagers, seeing this, followed without saying a word. The Party Branch and various branches have established the practice of mobilizing the masses to evaluate Party members, with preliminary evaluations every half year and final evaluations every year, giving "real" suggestions, forming a good practice of the masses supervising Party members and Party members supervising cadres.

"That's great! Only such Party members and cadres have authority," Zhao Ziyang praised. "I think your experience has three points: First, common prosperity. Developing collective enterprises is one form, and Party members and cadres leading the villagers to prosperity in individual cooperative economies is another form. Regardless of the economic form, the ultimate goal is to lead the villagers to the path of common prosperity. Second, insist on promoting both material and spiritual civilizations. Without a good material civilization, it is difficult to promote spiritual civilization. Even with a good material civilization, spiritual civilization is not necessarily good. Therefore, we must pay attention to work in the ideological and political fields. Third, strengthen Party building, and give full play to the role of the Party organization as a stronghold and the Party members as vanguards and models."

Outside the window, the snowflakes were still dancing. Zhao Ziyang stood up and said, "Let's go and visit some households."

Leaving the meeting room, the General Secretary walked along the mountain path, stepping on the snow to the home of Li Jingjian, the car driver. Unfortunately, the owner was away on a business trip, and his wife, Niu Huirong, was a bit embarrassed to see the central and provincial leaders. The General Secretary spoke to her in heavy Henan dialect, asking about her family, income, who takes care of the children, and where her husband learned to drive. She answered the first few questions easily, but the last one stumped her: "I don't know where he learned to drive." The General Secretary joked, "It seems you didn't do a good job of investigation during your courtship." Everyone laughed.

At the home of Li Dongzhou, a technician at the village refractory materials factory, Zhao Ziyang saw eight new brick rooms with tiled floors, a color TV, a stereo, and high-end furniture, and happily said, "The technicians in the enterprise earn more than the general skilled workers, and the skilled workers earn more than the general workers. Distribution according to work, with appropriate differences in levels, makes management and distribution much more flexible. This is the advantage of township enterprises."

At 5 PM, the General Secretary was ready to leave. The cadres and villagers gathered at the village entrance to see him off. The General Secretary's car disappeared into the snowstorm.

　　总书记冒雪访山村
    新华社记者  赵德润
    １月１０日上午，雪花飘撒在中原大地上。
    中共中央总书记赵紫阳在河南省委书记杨析综、省长程维高的陪同下，乘面包车从郑州向河南“双文明”建设的先进典型——巩县小关乡竹林村驶去。
    汽车在竹林村停下，赵紫阳看到高大的厂房和一座座新砖房，露出了笑容。村党总支书记赵明恩和村委会女主任李淑转怎么也想不到，这样的大雪天总书记来了。他们惊喜地拉着总书记的手，把他让进会议室。
    紫阳同志和村干部坐在一起，捧起一杯清茶，便和人们交谈起来。他详细地询问了竹林村生产发展和农民生活情况：有多少土地，口粮够不够吃，吃水还有没有困难，是否大多数农户都住上了新房，学龄前儿童能不能全都入学，是不是家家户户都有电视机，农民每月能不能看上一场电影。听着村干部的回答，他连连点头。
    竹林是小关乡一个大山村。６道山、６条沟分布着５个自然村，４００多户人家。过去这里山高土薄，水源奇缺，长期贫困。到１９８０年，全村工农业总产值才９０万元，人均收入７９元。１９８３年６月，懂技术、善管理的赵明恩当选为村党总支书记。他带领群众利用本地资源，发展工副业，走勤劳致富之路。村里相继办起了小煤窑、耐火砖厂、化工厂、制药厂等１７个厂矿，形成以集体经济为主、个体联合体经济为辅，多种经济形式竞相发展的局面。去年产值达到２１００万元，向国家上缴税金８４万元，人均收入１２５０元。近几年，这里没有发生一起刑事案件，也没有发生封建迷信、赌博、打架斗殴和超生、早育现象。
    “你们是怎样发展成现在这个样子的？”紫阳同志问。
    赵明恩向总书记谈起了商品生产发展起来以后走过的一段弯路。１９８２年前后，村里办起几个工厂，经济发展了，奖金多了，可思想工作放松了。有的党员干部只顾个人抓钱，群众办事找不到干部，村上连个会都开不起来。党组织不管事了。几个村民因违法犯罪受到劳动教养，全村党员干部都很痛心。１９８５年，在全村党员大会上，确定了一手抓发展经济，一手抓思想工作，带领群众走共同富裕之路的指导思想。这好比我们村的“一号文件”！从此，我们加强了思想政治工作，抓学习，抓谈心，抓评先进。村里每年都要评出好党员、好团员、好青年、好民兵、好妯娌、好媳妇、好家庭，大力表彰。人们很看重这种精神鼓励。村上评出的好媳妇，坐上彩车，唢呐班吹吹打打送到娘家。婆家、娘家都像过喜事一样高兴。真正重视起来，一两年村上风气就变了。
    赵紫阳问：“你们村里的党员干部是怎样起作用的？”
    村委会主任李淑转介绍说，竹林村７４名党员，在全村２１０７口人中是个小数，作用却很大。党总支要求党员干部吃苦在前，得利在后。党员一作出样子，群众就跟上了。村里规定修路、修房，群众每年出５个义务工，党员出１２个义务工。按照村里的规定，总支书记、村委会主任完成本职工作，每月工资可领到５３０元，但他们只分别领取２００元和１５０元，钱少拿，工作却要拚命干。一次村上耐火砖出窑，突然停电，无法鼓风散热，重信用的竹林人又要按合同给买主送砖。关键时刻总支书记和几个党员干部身披打湿水的棉被、棉衣，手上套着旧鞋，钻进灼热的窑膛。群众一看，二话不说，也都跟着干。党总支和各支部把发动群众评论党员作为一项制度，半年一初评，一年一总评，提意见“真刀真枪”，形成了群众监督党员、党员监督干部的好风气。
    “这样好！这样的党员和干部才有威信。”紫阳同志称赞说。“我觉得你们的经验有三条：一是共同富裕。发展集体企业是一种形式，党员干部在个体联合体中带领群众致富也是一种形式。不管哪种经济形式，最终是要带领群众走共同富裕的道路。二是坚持两个文明一起抓，物质文明搞不好，精神文明是很难搞得好的。物质文明搞得好，精神文明也不一定搞得好。因此，要重视思想政治领域的工作。三是加强党的建设，发挥党组织的战斗堡垒作用和党员的先锋模范作用。”
    窗外仍在雪花飞舞。紫阳同志立起身来说：“走，到农户家看看去。”
    从会议室出来，总书记沿着山路，踏雪来到汽车司机李经建家里。不巧主人出差在外，他的妻子牛惠荣见中央和省市领导来了，有些拘谨。总书记用浓重的河南乡音和她拉家常，问她家几口人，家庭收入有多少，小孩谁照看，丈夫是在哪儿学会开车的。头几个问题她都随口答出，最后一个问题可把她难住了：“我也不知道他在哪儿学开车的。”总书记风趣地说：“看来谈恋爱时没搞好调查研究啊。”一句话把大家都逗笑了。
    在村耐火材料厂技术员李东州家里，紫阳同志看到八间新砖房都是瓷砖铺地，彩电、收录机和高档家具一应俱全，便高兴地说：“企业的技术人员比一般熟练工人工资高，熟练工人又比一般工人工资高，按劳分配，适当拉开档次，管理和分配要灵活得多。这就是乡镇企业的长处。”
    下午５时，总书记要走了，干部群众聚集在村口送别。总书记的汽车消失在风雪中。
