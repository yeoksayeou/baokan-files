The United Nations Institute for Namibia held a graduation ceremony on January 21 for its tenth batch of graduates, sending them off to serve the soon-to-be-independent Namibia.

To provide Namibia with a group of qualified administrators, the United Nations established this institute in 1977, with its campus located in Lusaka, the capital of Zambia.

Over the past 12 years, the institute has trained 1,263 administrative personnel, 208 secretaries, 133 teachers, and 33 legal professionals. Among them, 159 graduates have been sent to other countries for further studies.
