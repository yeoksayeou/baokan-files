	State Council leaders recently, while listening to a report from the Ministry of Light Industry, pointed out that ensuring effective supply in the light industry market is a crucial issue. Both the central government and local authorities must guarantee this. Everyone should support light industry production to ensure effective supply in the light industry market.

	In discussing the products that must be guaranteed in the market, the State Council leaders said: First, essential goods for people's livelihood must not be out of stock or discontinued; second, high foreign exchange-earning products should prioritize exports over domestic sales; third, high-end consumer goods should be produced within our capabilities, with an emphasis on quality and domestication. Specifically, essential goods for people's livelihood, including salt, sugar, detergent, soap, matches, newsprint, enamelware, daily-use aluminum products, and toilet paper, must ensure market supply without interruption. As long as there are no major issues with food and daily necessities, the market will remain stable. The raw materials needed for the production of these essential goods must be guaranteed. As for high foreign exchange-earning products, these are contributions to the country and must be seriously promoted. High-quality refrigerators, freezers, washing machines, bicycles, pianos, beer, and high-quality white spirits and cigarettes should all be exported as much as possible, especially branded products from designated factories, which should primarily focus on exports. Support should be given to designated, branded export products to compete in the international market. Light industry enterprises should coordinate and unite, avoid multiple entities competing externally, avoid mutual price undercutting, improve product quality, and build a strong brand. High-end consumer goods that can quickly recirculate currency should be produced within our capabilities. Domestic consumers should also be guaranteed quality, and substandard products should not be used to deceive the public, but these products should be produced as much as possible, and consumption should be correctly guided.

	The State Council leaders pointed out that white spirit production should focus on a few brands. China does not have enough grain to produce so much alcohol, so white spirit production must be controlled. White spirits should gradually move towards lower alcohol content, and high-alcohol white spirits should be subject to additional taxation. Canned beverages should be exported as much as possible and should not be encouraged for domestic sales.

	The State Council leaders also requested the proper arrangement of foreign exchange needed for light industry production, with the help of local authorities, efforts from enterprises, and assistance from the Foreign Exchange Administration. Local authorities should support the resolution of some foreign exchange adjustments to import raw materials needed for light industry production.

	Those who listened to the report from Minister of Light Industry Zeng Xianlin included Vice Secretary of the State Council Yan Ying and Wang Shuming, as well as relevant responsible officials from the State Planning Commission, Ministry of Finance, Ministry of Commerce, Ministry of Materials, Ministry of Foreign Economic Relations and Trade, Ministry of Energy, and the People's Bank of China.

　　国务院领导同志要求确保轻工市场的有效供给
    生活必需品不能断档
    本报北京１月１９日讯  新华社记者杨理科、本报记者刘桂莲报道：国务院领导同志最近在听取轻工业部工作汇报时指出，轻工市场的有效供给是个重要问题，不仅中央要保，地方也要保。大家都来支持轻工生产，确保轻工市场的有效供给。
    在谈到市场必保的产品时，国务院领导同志说，第一是人民生活必需品，不能断档脱销；第二是高创汇产品，内销要服从外销；第三是高档消费品，要量力而为，强调质量，强调国产化。具体地讲，包括盐、糖、洗衣粉、肥皂、火柴、新闻纸、搪瓷制品、日用精铝制品、卫生纸等在内的这些人民生活必需品，必须保证市场不能断档。只要吃的、用的不发生大问题，日用必需品不出大问题，市场就稳定了。对于人民生活必需品生产所需的原材料要保证供应。至于高创汇产品，这是给国家作贡献的，要认真抓一抓。名牌电冰箱、冰柜、洗衣机、自行车、钢琴、啤酒以及名牌白酒、卷烟等，都应争取多出口，特别是定点厂的名牌产品，要以出口为主。对定点、定牌子的出口商品要给以扶持，要争夺国际市场。轻工企业应协调联合，不能多头对外，不能互相压价，要把产品质量搞上去，把牌子打响。能够高回笼货币的高档消费品，要量力而为。对国内消费者也要保证质量，不能用次品欺骗群众，但这些产品能生产多少就生产多少，要正确引导消费。
    国务院领导同志指出，白酒生产就搞几个名牌，我国没有这么多粮食造酒，必须控制白酒生产。白酒要逐步走向低度化，高度白酒要加征税收。易拉罐饮料要尽量出口，不鼓励在国内销售。
    国务院领导同志还要求妥善安排轻工生产所需要的外汇，要让地方帮助，企业努力，外汇管理局协助。各地要支持解决一些调剂外汇，用于进口轻工生产所需的原材料。
    听取轻工业部部长曾宪林工作汇报的还有国务院副秘书长阎颖、王书明，以及国家计委、财政部、商业部、物资部、经贸部、能源部、中国人民银行等单位的有关负责同志。
