The fourth session of the Standing Committee of the Seventh National Committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference concluded in Beijing this afternoon. The session decided that the second session of the Seventh National Committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference will be held in the latter half of March 1989 in Beijing.

Li Xiannian, Chairman of the National Committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference, presided over the meeting.

The meeting adopted the "Provisional Regulations on Political Consultation and Democratic Supervision by the National Committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference." Zhou Shaozhen, Secretary-General of the National Committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference, reported to the Standing Committee members on the discussions and revisions of the provisional regulations on political consultation and democratic supervision.

Wang Renzhong, Vice Chairman of the National Committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference, spoke at the meeting. He said that the provisional regulations on political consultation and democratic supervision, which have just been adopted, have been prepared over a long period. Their starting point is to be practical and feasible. Once they are formulated, they must be implemented and put into practice. Of course, these are only provisional regulations, and in the future, they will be continuously improved with the development of practice.

Wang Renzhong said that after the 13th National Congress of the Communist Party of China, the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China has repeatedly emphasized that the system of multi-party cooperation and political consultation under the leadership of the Communist Party, along with the system of people's congresses, are fundamental systems of China's political structure. In our vast country with a large population, multiple ethnic groups, and multiple parties, major issues concerning the national economy and people's livelihood should, on the one hand, be decided by the people's congresses exercising state power, and on the other hand, be consulted with various democratic parties and people from all walks of life through the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference before making decisions. This approach of making decisions after political consultation is an important feature and advantage of China's socialist democratic politics.

He said that the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference, as the main organizational form for implementing the system of multi-party cooperation and political consultation under the leadership of the Communist Party, has an even heavier responsibility. Its work should not only not be weakened but also further strengthened. The adoption of the provisional regulations on political consultation and democratic supervision by this Standing Committee is to further strengthen political consultation and democratic supervision in China's political life and gradually achieve regularization and institutionalization. Of course, having regulations alone is not enough; the key is implementation. After the regulations are adopted, not only should the Party committees strengthen leadership and the government provide cooperation, but everyone should also work together to implement them. He hoped that the Standing Committee members would exchange experiences promptly when they have any, and reflect on problems promptly to facilitate improvements.

The Standing Committee also adopted the list of additional vice chairpersons and members of the special committees of the National Committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference. The meeting decided to appoint Zhou Weizhi as the Vice Chairman of the Education and Culture Committee of the National Committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference; Chen Rulong as a member of the Economic Committee of the National Committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference; Tang Youqi as a member of the Science and Technology Committee of the National Committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference; Fang Rongxin as a member of the Medical, Health, and Sports Committee of the National Committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference.

Huo Maizheng, Dong Youxian, and Jing Shuping, Standing Committee members, spoke at the meeting.

Vice Chairpersons of the National Committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference Fang Yi, Gu Mu, Yang Jingren, Kang Keqing, Zhou Peiyuan, Qu Wu, Liu Jingji, Wang Enmao, Qian Xuesen, Qian Weichang, Sun Xiaocun, Cheng Siyuan, Qian Zhengying, Su Buqing, and Sima Yimaiti attended the meeting.

　　七届全国政协常委会第四次会议闭会    
    通过关于政治协商、民主监督暂行规定
    决定３月下半月召开七届政协二次会议
    新华社北京１月２７日电  今天下午在北京闭会的中国人民政治协商会议第七届全国委员会常务委员会第四次会议决定：中国人民政治协商会议第七届全国委员会第二次会议定于１９８９年３月下半月在北京召开。
    全国政协主席李先念主持了会议。
    会议通过了《政协全国委员会关于政治协商、民主监督的暂行规定》。全国政协秘书长周绍铮在会上向常委们汇报了分组讨论和修改关于政治协商、民主监督的暂行规定的情况。
    全国政协副主席王任重在会上讲了话。他说，刚刚通过的关于政治协商、民主监督的暂行规定，是经过长时间酝酿准备的，它的立足点是要切实可行。制定出来就要贯彻执行，就要做到。当然，它只是一个暂行规定，今后还要随着实践的发展不断总结经验，使它逐步完善起来。
    王任重说，中共十三大以后，中共中央多次强调，共产党领导下的多党合作制度和政治协商制度，同人民代表大会制度一样，都是我国政治体制中的根本制度。在我们这样一个幅员辽阔、人口众多的多民族、多党派的社会主义大国，凡是关系国计民生的重大问题，一方面由人民代表大会行使国家权力作出决策，一方面事先经过人民政协同各民主党派和各界人士进行协商，广泛听取意见，取得统一认识，这种经过政治协商然后再形成决策的做法，是我国社会主义民主政治的一个重要特点和优点。
    他说，人民政协作为实现共产党领导下的多党合作制度和政治协商制度的主要组织形式，它的任务比过去更重了，它的工作不仅不能削弱，还要进一步加强。这次常委会议通过了关于政治协商、民主监督的暂行规定，就是要使我国政治生活中的政治协商、民主监督得到进一步加强，逐步实现经常化和制度化。当然，只有制度还不行，关键在于落实。规定通过以后，不仅需要党委加强领导，政府予以配合协作，还需要大家共同努力贯彻执行。他希望常委们在执行过程中有经验及时交流，有问题及时反映，以便改进。
    今天的常委会还通过了全国政协专门委员会副主任、委员增补名单。会议决定增补周巍峙为全国政协教育文化委员会副主任；陈如龙为全国政协经济委员会委员；唐有祺为全国政协科技委员会委员；方荣欣为全国政协医药卫生体育委员会委员。
    霍懋征、董幼娴、经叔平常委在会上发了言。
    全国政协副主席方毅、谷牧、杨静仁、康克清、周培源、屈武、刘靖基、王恩茂、钱学森、钱伟长、孙晓村、程思远、钱正英、苏步青、司马义·艾买提，出席了会议。
