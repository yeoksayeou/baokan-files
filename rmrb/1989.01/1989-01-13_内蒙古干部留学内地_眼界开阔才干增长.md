	Inner Mongolia Cadres Study in Mainland China: Broadening Horizons and Enhancing Capabilities

	Xinhua News Agency, Hohhot: Recently, the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region has selected a group of cadres from various levels of party and government departments and economic units to study in economically developed cities such as Wenzhou, Dalian, and Qingdao. This is a specific measure taken by the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region to improve the quality of its cadres.

	This time, Inner Mongolia sent cadres to study in mainland China, mainly through two methods: First, by arranging the dispatched cadres in business-related departments and units, with or without official appointments, to directly participate in the practical activities of the leadership teams of the receiving units, thereby improving their management and decision-making capabilities. Second, by having the receiving units organize training classes for them, sharing experiences and conducting on-site inspections to broaden their horizons.

　　内蒙古干部留学内地
    眼界开阔才干增长
    本报呼和浩特讯  记者傲腾报道：最近，内蒙古自治区从各级党政部门和经济部门中选派一批干部到经济发达的温州、大连、青岛等地、市带职“留学”。这是内蒙古自治区为提高干部素质而采取的一项具体措施。
    内蒙古这次选派干部到内地“留学”，主要采取了两种办法：一是把派遣干部安排到业务对口的部门、单位，挂职或不挂职，直接参与接收单位领导班子的实践活动，以利于提高他们管理、决策能力。二是委托接收单位给他们办培训班，介绍经验、实地考察，以开阔眼界。
