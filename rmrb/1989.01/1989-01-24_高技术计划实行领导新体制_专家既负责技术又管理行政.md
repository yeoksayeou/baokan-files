A veterinarian from Inner Mongolia University, who holds a doctorate, has had his research on in vitro fertilization of calves approved as a new project under the high-tech plan in the field of biology. This marks the complete establishment of the new leadership system by experts in the implementation of the high-tech plan.

As a medium-to-long-term scientific and technological plan for China, the high-tech research and development plan has undergone reforms in its leadership system from the outset. The core of this reform is that the formulation and implementation of the entire plan are led by expert committees and expert groups. Government agencies set up specialized offices to serve as support institutions. This reform has changed the previous management method where experts were responsible for technology, and projects were decided administratively. Researchers have described the previous method as experts being "prophetic" during plan discussions, "retrospective" during plan formulation, and "unaware" during plan implementation.

This is no longer the case. The expert committees, selected by the state, are only accountable to the state. They serve as both technical and administrative commanders. From the initiation of high-tech research topics, the bidding or evaluation of project tasks, the approval of research funding arrangements, the assignment of tasks to advantageous units and individuals, to the annual inspection of task completion, and the adjustment of project teams based on this, the expert committees and expert groups take full responsibility. It is understood that by the end of last year, the Biotechnology Expert Committee, through its annual inspection, adjusted about 5% of the projects. Some project teams and individuals who, for various reasons, did not complete their tasks well either received a "yellow card warning" or were stripped of their qualifications to participate in certain research.

Whether the expert committees can stand on the national level and act impartially is a key issue for the authoritative leadership of the plan. According to past experience, personnel sent by a unit often become representatives of that unit's interests, which makes units that do not send personnel to the leadership layer feel "disadvantaged." The chief scientist in the field of biotechnology said that the power given by the state must be used impartially and that scientific and democratic management must be upheld. In addition to having good intentions, a set of strict scientific rules and management regulations must be established and strictly followed. In the high-tech plan, the expert committees, chief scientists, expert group members, group leaders, subject leaders, and project leaders all have clear responsibilities. The application and approval of projects established based on international scientific and technological development trends also have clear procedural regulations. Participation in high-tech plan research does not guarantee a secure position, and the competition mechanism runs through the entire process of plan implementation. By the end of last year, during their inspection of the progress of various projects, they invited nearly 10% of non-high-tech plan participants but researchers in similar fields to present papers, implementing a system of merit-based selection. The new project on in vitro fertilization of calves was established in this way.

### 高技术计划实行领导新体制  专家既负责技术又管理行政

　　高技术计划实行领导新体制
    专家既负责技术又管理行政
    本报讯  记者陈祖甲报道：内蒙古大学一位兽医博士从事的奶牛试管牛犊研究，最近被高技术计划生物领域专家委员会批准，作为这个计划的新立课题。这件事标志着专家领导新体制已在高技术计划的实施中完整地建立。
    作为我国中长期科技计划的高技术研究发展计划，一开始就在领导体制方面实行了改革，其核心内容是整个计划的制定和实施都由专家委员会和专家组实行统一领导。政府机关设立的专门办公室只是其服务机构。这一改革改变了过去的技术由专家负责，项目由行政决策的管理办法。研究人员称过去的办法是专家在“讨论计划时是先知先觉，制定计划时是后知后觉，落实实施计划时是不知不觉”。
    现在不是这样了。由国家选聘的专家委员会，只对国家负责，既是技术指挥，又是行政指挥。从高技术研究的立题、课题任务招标或评议，研究经费安排的审定，把任务落实到优势单位和个人，直到年终检查任务完成的情况，并据此对课题组进行调整，专家委员会和专家组负起一切责任。据了解，去年年底，生物技术专家委员会通过年终检查，对５％左右的课题进行调整。一些因种种原因完成任务不好的课题组和个人，或者受到“黄牌警告”，或被撤销参加某项研究的资格。
    专家委员会能否站在国家立场上，公正处事，是对计划实施权威性领导的一个关键问题。按照以往的经验，哪个单位派出的人员，往往成为本单位利益的代表，这使没有派人进入领导层的单位产生“吃亏”等疑虑。生物技术领域的首席科学家说，国家给我们的权力，能否公正地用好，能否坚持科学、民主管理，除了有良好的愿望外，还要制定一套严密的科学规章制度和管理细则，严格遵守。在高技术计划中，专家委员会、首席科学家、专家组成员、专家组组长、专题负责人、课题负责人各有自己明确的责任。对根据国际科技发展趋势确立的课题，其申报和审批也有明确的程序规定。参加高技术计划研究并不进入保险箱，不能捧铁饭碗，竞争机制自始至终贯穿在计划实施的全过程。去年年底，他们在检查各课题进展情况时，邀请了近１０％的非高技术计划参加者但又从事相似研究的技术人员报告论文，实行优胜劣汰。奶牛试管牛犊新课题就是这样确立的。
