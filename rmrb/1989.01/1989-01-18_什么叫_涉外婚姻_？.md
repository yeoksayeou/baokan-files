Recently, a student studying abroad returned to China with a Chinese passport and registered his marriage with his girlfriend in a certain place in Northeast China.

During the registration process, a staff member said that since he had returned from the United States, the marriage should be handled as a cross-border marriage. As a result, the student had to pay a higher fee to obtain the marriage certificate. I would like to ask, what is a "cross-border marriage"?

The Marriage Law of our country does not have specific provisions regarding cross-border marriages. With the approval of the State Council, the Ministry of Civil Affairs issued the Marriage Registration Regulations on March 15, 1986, which stipulate in Article 14 that the marriage registration of Chinese citizens with foreigners should be handled in accordance with the "Several Provisions on the Marriage Registration of Chinese Citizens with Foreigners" (approved by the State Council on August 17, 1983, and promulgated by the Ministry of Civil Affairs on August 26, 1983). The marriages mentioned here between Chinese citizens and foreigners are what is commonly referred to as cross-border marriages, including cross-border marriages and cross-border divorces. Marriages between Chinese citizens registered by marriage registration agencies within China in accordance with the conditions stipulated in the Marriage Law do not fall under cross-border marriages.

The information you provided indicates that a staff member handling marriage registration in a certain place in Northeast China referred to the marriage registration of a Chinese student who had studied in the United States as a "cross-border marriage," which is incorrect. Chinese citizens who go abroad to study or handle official business are issued passports by the Chinese government. A passport is a document used to prove the identity of citizens going abroad. How can citizens holding Chinese passports returning to China to get married be considered foreigners? It seems that the staff member either lacks common knowledge or intentionally overcharged the fee.

　　什么叫“涉外婚姻”？
    编辑同志：
    不久前，一位留学生持中国护照回国，与女友在东北某地办理了结婚登记手续。
    在办理手续时，一工作人员说，他是从美国回来的，应按涉外婚姻办理。结果，这位留学生花了较高的手续费才领取了结婚证书。请问什么叫“涉外婚姻”？　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　         
             梁钢
    梁钢同志：
    我国婚姻法对涉外婚姻问题，并无专门规定。经国务院批准，民政部于１９８６年３月１５日发布的婚姻登记办法第１４条规定：中国公民同外国人的婚姻登记，应按照《中国公民同外国人办理婚姻登记的几项规定》（１９８３年８月１７日国务院批准，１９８３年８月２６日民政部颁布）办理。这里所说的中国公民同外国人的婚姻，就是通常说的涉外婚姻，包括涉外结婚与涉外离婚。中国公民之间依照婚姻法规定的条件，在中国境内由婚姻登记机关登记结婚，当然不属涉外婚姻。
    你信中反映，东北某地一位办理婚姻登记的工作人员，把在美国留学的中国人回国办理结婚登记称为“涉外婚姻”，当然是不对的。中国人出国留学、办理公务，都要由中国政府发给出国护照。护照，是用以证明出国公民身份的证件，怎么能把持中国护照回国结婚的公民视为外国人呢？看来，那位工作人员不是缺乏常识，就是存心多索取手续费。
