The perpetrator was immediately apprehended by two armed police officers and a soldier who were on the same train. The two armed police officers are Ai Zhong and Yang Bin from the Zunyi Armed Police Detachment. The name of the soldier is unknown. After the train reached the Gaoshui Station, the injured were immediately sent to a local hospital for emergency treatment.
