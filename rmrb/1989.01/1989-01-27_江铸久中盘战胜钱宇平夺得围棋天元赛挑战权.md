Jiang Zhujiu Secures Right to Challenge for the Go Title

Today, Jiang Zhujiu, a 9th dan player, made a brilliant move to turn the tide of the game, defeating Money Yiping, who was initially in a dominant position, in a middle-game victory. This secured Jiang Zhujiu the right to challenge for the third Go Title.

After the two 9th dan players had been playing for 5 hours, the situation became clear. Experts watching the game believed that Jiang Zhujiu had no way out of his predicament. Seeing that his opponent was struggling, Money Yiping seized the opportunity to end the game. However, after placing a stone, he realized he had fallen into a trap. His large group of stones was now in a fight with the opponent's stones, and he was short of one breath. As a result, one wrong move led to the loss of the entire game.

Jiang Zhujiu finally secured his first chance to compete in the final of a major domestic tournament. He will challenge the current title holder, Liu Xiaoguang, in early March in Changshu and Shanghai. The new title holder will then face the Japanese title holder, Zhao Chi Xun, in the second China-Japan Go Title match.

　　江铸久中盘战胜钱宇平夺得围棋天元赛挑战权
    本报北京１月２６日讯  今天，九段棋手江铸久一记妙手起死回生，中盘战胜本已稳操胜券的钱宇平九段，从而夺得第三届围棋天元赛的挑战权。
    当这两位九段对弈５小时后，形势已十分明朗，观战高手们均认为，江铸久再也无法摆脱困境。这时，钱宇平见左支右绌的对手又露破绽，便当即抓住战机，准备一举结束战斗，但一子落下，方知中计，自己一块大棋与对方形成对杀，偏偏又被点中要害而少了一气。结果一着棋错，满盘皆输。
    江铸久终于首次取得国内大赛的决赛权，他将于３月初在常熟、上海两地向上届天元刘小光九段挑战。新任天元将与日本天元赵治勋进行第二届中日天元赛。
