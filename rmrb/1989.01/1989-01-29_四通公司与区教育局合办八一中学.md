    Beijing Fourtune Company and Haidian District Education Bureau Jointly Operate Bayi Middle School
    Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, January 27 (Reporter Xia Junsheng) The largest privately-run technology enterprise in China, Beijing Fourtune Group, has decided to collaborate with the government in running schools. Today, the company signed an agreement with the Haidian District Education Bureau to jointly operate Bayi Middle School.

    Bayi Middle School was a children's school of the Beijing Military Region before 1964 and is now a regular middle school open to the public. Due to insufficient funds, the school's 40,000 square meters of buildings are in disrepair, teaching equipment cannot be updated in a timely manner, and teachers' bonuses do not have a stable source of funding. To support the education cause, Fourtune Company will, according to the agreement, be responsible for providing funds to Bayi Middle School for updating teaching equipment and renovating and developing the school. The company will also cover the shortfall in teaching funds and provide bonuses and welfare benefits for teachers and staff. In the first phase of the school's renovation, Fourtune Company will provide funds to build 12,000 square meters of teaching buildings and school-run enterprise facilities. At the same time, Bayi Middle School will hand over the management and operation of its factory and tertiary industry income-generating work to Fourtune Company, allowing the school to focus on teaching.

    According to a responsible person from the Haidian District Government, they will continue to support a number of new technology enterprises in collaborating with government education departments to run schools.

　　四通公司与区教育局合办八一中学
    新华社北京１月２７日电（记者夏俊生）我国最大的民办科技企业北京四通集团公司决定与政府联合办学。今天，这家公司同海淀区教育局签订了联合办八一中学的协议书。
    八一中学１９６４年以前是北京军区的子弟学校，现在已改为面向社会的普通中学。由于经费不足，学校４万多平方米的校舍年久失修，教学设备不能及时更新，教职工的奖金没有稳定的来源。为了支援教育事业，四通公司按协议将负责向八一中学提供更新教学设备和改建发展学校的经费，承担教学经费的不足部分和教职工的奖金、福利费用。校园改造一期工程中，四通公司将提供资金为学校建设１．２万平方米的教学楼和校办企业用房。同时，八一中学将把校办工厂和第三产业等创收工作，全部交由四通公司管理经营，使学校能集中精力搞好教学工作。
    据海淀区政府负责人介绍，他们将继续支持一批新技术企业与政府教育部门联合办学。
    王平、杨成武出席了签约仪式。
