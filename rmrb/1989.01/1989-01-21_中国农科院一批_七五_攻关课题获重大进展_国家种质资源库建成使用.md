The Chinese Academy of Agricultural Sciences has made significant progress in three key projects under the "Seventh Five-Year Plan": "Research on Major Crop Variety Resources," "New Variety Breeding," and "Comprehensive Pest and Disease Control Technology for Major Crops." Some of these projects have even completed their research tasks ahead of schedule.

This information was disclosed at the ongoing Chinese Academy of Agricultural Sciences work conference held today.

"The Research on Major Crop Variety Resources" is the first major project of the "Seventh Five-Year Plan." Over the past three years, the Institute of Crop Germplasm Resources at the Chinese Academy of Agricultural Sciences has organized more than 400 units and 2,500 people to work together on this project. By the end of 1988, the National Germplasm Resource Bank was completed, providing a major infrastructure for agricultural research in China. By the end of last year, the bank had stored 125,000 samples of various crop seeds. The plan is to store 200,000 samples during the "Seventh Five-Year Plan," and continue storing during the "Eighth Five-Year Plan" and "Ninth Five-Year Plan," with an estimated total of 400,000 samples, reaching an advanced international level in terms of storage quantity. Over the past three years, they have also propagated 180,000 samples of seeds, completed agronomic trait identification and cataloging for 127,000 samples, completed quality identification for over 100,000 samples, completed stress resistance identification for 130,000 samples, and completed disease and pest resistance identification for 350,000 samples. In the preservation of asexually propagated crops, more than 700 samples of sweet potato and potato tissue culture seedlings have been stored. The germination rate of corn pollen stored in liquid nitrogen at ultra-low temperatures for one year reached 73.4%, surpassing the international level of similar research. In terms of the investigation and collection of variety resources, the investigation of crop resources in the Shennongjia and Three Gorges regions of Hubei Province collected more than 7,100 samples of various crop resources; the investigation of crop resources on Hainan Island collected more than 3,900 samples of various crop resources.

"The New Variety Breeding" is led by the Institute of Crop Breeding and Cultivation at the Academy. After three years of hard work, 23 new varieties have been bred according to the contract requirements, covering an area of 70 million mu, exceeding the predetermined target and generating significant economic benefits. The promotion and planting of excellent new wheat varieties alone has increased wheat production by 314,960 tons, adding more than 2.5 billion yuan to the total social output value.

"The Comprehensive Pest and Disease Control Technology for Major Crops" is led by the Institute of Plant Protection at the Academy. Over the past three years, more than 40 excellent varieties resistant to multiple pests and diseases have been screened out, and demonstration and promotion have been carried out on 110 million mu. Pesticides for pest and disease control have now introduced more than 10 new varieties that are highly effective against pests and diseases but harmless to natural enemies. Major crop pests and diseases such as corn leaf blight, cotton wilt disease, rice bacterial blight, and cotton aphids in the seedling stage have been effectively controlled.

　　中国农科院一批“七五”攻关课题获重大进展    
    国家种质资源库建成使用
    本报北京１月２０日讯  记者何黄彪报道：由中国农业科学院主持的“主要农作物品种资源研究”、“新品种选育”、“主要农作物病虫害综合防治技术”三个“七五”期间国家重点攻关课题，取得了重大进展，有的已提前完成了科研任务。
    这是记者从今天正在召开的中国农科院工作会议上获悉的。
    “主要农作物品种资源研究”是我国“七五”攻关的第一个重大项目。三年来，中国农科院作物品种资源研究所组织了４００多个单位、２５００多人进行协作攻关，到１９８８年底，建成了国家种质资源库，为我国农业研究工作提供了重大的基础设施。到去年底，已贮存各种作物种子１２．５万份，计划“七五”期间入库贮存２０万份，“八五”、“九五”期间将继续存入，估计总数可达４０万份，在保存数量上将达到国际先进水平。三年来，他们还繁殖种子１８万多份，完成农艺性状鉴定和编目１２．７万份，完成品质鉴定１０万多份次，完成抗逆性鉴定１３万多份次，完成抗病虫性鉴定３５万多份次。在无性繁殖作物的保存方面，已贮存甘薯、马铃薯试管苗７００余份。玉米花粉超低温液态氮保存一年后最高结实率达到７３．４％，超过国际同类研究水平。在品种资源的考察收集方面，湖北神农架及三峡地区作物资源考察共收集各类作物资源７１００余份；海南岛作物资源考察共收集各类作物资源３９００余份。
    “新品种选育”是该院作物育种栽培研究所主持的。经过三年的艰苦努力，按合同要求育成了２３个新品种，覆盖面积７０００万亩，已超过了预定目标，产生了重大的经济效益。仅优良的小麦新品种，经过推广种植，共增产小麦３１４．９６万吨，增加社会总产值２５亿多元。
    “主要农作物病虫害综合防治技术”，是该院植物保护研究所主持的。三年来，共筛选出４０多个兼抗、多抗病虫害的优良品种，已示范推广１．１亿亩。防治病虫的农药，目前已推出既对病虫有特效且对天敌无害的新品种１０多种，控制住了玉米大斑病、小斑病，棉花枯萎病，水稻白叶枯病，棉花苗期蚜虫等主要农作物病虫害。
