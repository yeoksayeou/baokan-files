	Beijing Train Section Emphasizes Integrity
	Over 32,000 Yuan in Gifts Refused in One Year

	People's Daily reports: The staff of Beijing Train Section firmly uphold the principle of "The people's railway serves the people," refusing bribes and gifts, maintaining integrity. Over the past year, they have refused gifts from 873 individuals, totaling over 32,000 yuan.

	Beijing Train Section is the largest train section in the country. In the current situation where transportation capacity is insufficient, making it difficult to buy tickets and even harder to secure a sleeper berth, many units and individuals try every means to establish connections with the staff of Beijing Train Section, often resorting to giving money and gifts. Some units and individuals who have received conveniences from the train section also often express their thanks by sending money and gifts. In response, the leaders of Beijing Train Section firmly adhere to the principles of not accepting bribes or gifts and frequently educate their staff to maintain integrity.

	Last summer, an old comrade who had retired from this section and was now working at an external hotel wanted to organize some guests to stay through this section's incoming Beijing trains, and sent 10 pounds of high-grade tea to the section chief Guan Zhihua, who refused it. A work-related unit, to express gratitude for the convenience provided by the train section in securing train tickets, sent two standing fans to two deputy section chiefs, which were also declined.

	The 47/48 train from Beijing to Guangzhou is a popular route nationwide. Some small vendors, in order to secure sleeper berths, carry more goods, or smuggle items, often bribe the staff. On November 13 last year, three vendors boarded the 47th train at Hankou Station, offering 300 yuan in bribes to the train conductor Zhang Yuhua to secure three sleeper berths, which was refused, and their behavior was sternly criticized.

	On November 5 last year, the 163rd train from Beijing to Chengdu departed from Beijing Station. A 75-year-old elderly person approached the party branch secretary and train conductor Hu Yanshi to request a sleeper berth, and slipped 30 yuan into his pocket. Hu Yanshi politely said, "Grandpa, please take back your money. We are employees of the people's railway and do not accept bribes." He then arranged for the elderly person to have a sleeper berth and invited him to rest in the sleeper car.

	On June 20 last year, after the 4th train from Moscow to Beijing arrived in Beijing, the Communist Party member and train attendant Song Jinyang escorted a disabled British tourist to the hotel. The tourist, moved, offered 50 dollars, which was politely declined.

　　北京列车段注重廉洁
    一年来拒收钱物共三万两千多元
    本报讯  北京列车段干部职工牢记“人民铁路为人民”的宗旨，不受贿，不收礼，清正廉洁，一年来共拒收送钱送物８７３人次，人民币３．２万多元。
    北京列车段是全国最大的列车段。在当前运输能力不足，乘车难、买票难、乘卧铺更难的情况下，不少单位和个人都想方设法与北京列车段的干部职工拉关系，送钱送物的事常常发生；一些得到过列车段提供方便而表示感谢的单位和个人，也往往要送钱、送物。对此，北京列车段的领导干部坚持做到不受贿、不收礼，还经常教育职工要清正廉洁。
    去年夏天，一位在本段离休后又在外单位办旅馆的老同志，想通过这个段的进京列车组织一些客人去住宿，给段长关志华送来１０斤高级茶叶，被他拒绝。有一个工作关系单位，为感谢列车段给他们提供的乘车方便，给两位副段长送来两个落地电风扇，同样被谢绝。
    北京至广州的４７／４８次列车是全国的“热门”车，一些小商贩为了要卧铺、多带货或想带一些走私物品，就经常给工作人员行贿送礼。去年１１月１３日，４７次列车到达汉口车站时，上来三个小商贩，为了要３个卧铺，拿出３００元钱的好处费送给列车长张玉华，被他拒绝，还严厉批评了他们的行为。
    去年１１月５日，北京至成都的１６３次列车，从北京站开出后，一位７５岁的老人找到列车党支部书记、列车长胡延锡要一个卧铺，并拿出３０元钱塞到他衣兜里。胡延锡和气地说：“老大爷请收回你的钱，我们是人民铁路的工作人员，不收好处费。”随后给老人办理了卧铺，将老人请到卧车休息。
    去年６月２０日，莫斯科至北京的４次列车到京后，共产党员、列车员宋金祥将一位英国残疾旅客送到旅店，感动得这位客人拿出５０美元送给他，被婉言谢绝。
