Hundreds of CPPCC members in Guangxi read and evaluated the annual work report of the Autonomous Region Government for the first time before the convening of the same-level People's Congress.

Chen Huiguang, Chairman of the Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous Region CPPCC, said at the second session of the Sixth CPPCC of Guangxi held on January 10 that Guangxi has changed the traditional practice of holding the CPPCC and the People's Congress at the same level simultaneously. The CPPCC meeting is held before the People's Congress, which is beneficial to mobilize the enthusiasm of CPPCC members to participate in politics and decision-making, improve the quality and effectiveness of political consultation and democratic supervision, and conduct consultations before decision-making, thereby promoting the democratization and scientific decision-making of the Party committee and the government.

Relevant materials show that 328 proposals raised by members at the last meeting have been adopted and implemented by government departments, with 67% already in implementation or planned for implementation.

　　加强政治协商推进民主建设
    桂政协委员积极议政参政
    本报南宁１月１１日电  记者郑盛丰报道：广西数百名政协委员第一次在同级人代会召开之前，就阅读和评议自治区政府的年度工作报告。
    广西壮族自治区政协主席陈辉光，在１０日召开的广西区政协六届二次会上说，广西改变以往政协和人大两个大会同时召开的传统作法，区政协会议先于人代会召开，有利于调动政协委员参政议政的积极性，提高政治协商、民主监督的质量和效果，协商在决策之前，从而推进党委和政府决策的民主化和科学化。
    有关材料表明，上次大会上委员们提出的３２８件提案，被政府部门采纳付诸实施和正计划实施的占６７％。
