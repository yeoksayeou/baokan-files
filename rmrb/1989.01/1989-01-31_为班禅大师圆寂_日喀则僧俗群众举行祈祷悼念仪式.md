In memory of the Panchen Lama, devout Buddhists and laypeople in Shigatse hold prayer and mourning ceremonies.

Xinhua News Agency, Shigatse, January 30th - Devout Buddhists and laypeople in Shigatse held prayer and mourning ceremonies for the Panchen Lama.

Tonight, lamps were lit in every hall of Tashilhunpo Monastery and in the homes of residents throughout the city. Tens of thousands of urban residents and believers from various parts of Tibet, as well as Qinghai and Gansu, gathered around Tashilhunpo Monastery to circumambulate and pray. According to the monks of Tashilhunpo Monastery, this lamp-lit prayer and mourning ceremony will continue for seven days.

At the home of 61-year-old Pemdo, a resident of the Fifth Neighborhood Committee in Shigatse, the reporter saw the old lady praying in front of a butter lamp to the portrait of the Panchen Lama. She said, "The news of the Panchen Lama's passing shocked our entire family. My husband, Lobtsang Tsering, and I are deeply saddened."

Among the slowly moving crowd of circumambulators, Purbuchering, a farmer from Sakya County's Sa Township, told the reporter, "I came from Sakya County with the blessings of my parents and children, a family of seven. The Panchen Lama always wished us well. He is our beloved lama."

On the windowsills of all the monks in Tashilhunpo Monastery, lamps were lit in memory of the Panchen Lama. Young monk Lhabtsang Tsering told the reporter, "When the Panchen Lama was alive, he often taught us to propagate Buddhism, love the country and religion, study the scriptures diligently, and inherit Tibetan Buddhism. We must carry on the Panchen Lama's legacy and not disappoint his hopes."

All cinemas, theaters, and entertainment venues in Shigatse ceased operations today to mourn the Panchen Lama.

Xinhua News Agency, Shigatse, January 30th - More than 800 monks from Tashilhunpo Monastery, the largest temple in U-Tsang, held continuous religious ceremonies to mourn the Panchen Lama.

Tashilhunpo Monastery, one of the four great monasteries of Tibet, has been the main temple for the administration of political and religious affairs by the successive Panchen Lamas since the Fourth Panchen Lama. After the passing of the Panchen Lama, Tashilhunpo Monastery was shrouded in sorrow. Thousands of lamps in every hall and room burned day and night, and religious activities to mourn the Panchen Lama continued without interruption. In front of the main hall, Dregung Puntsok Langdun, several senior monks of Tashilhunpo Monastery took turns reciting scriptures and praying for the Lama's spirit day and night.

The head of the Tashilhunpo Monastery Democratic Management Committee, Phuntsok, told the reporter: "The Panchen Lama dedicated his life to maintaining national unity and propagating Buddhism. Every time he came to Tashilhunpo Monastery, he taught us to love the country and religion, pointing out that this is the mission of the successive Panchen Lamas and also the tradition of Tashilhunpo Monastery. We, the entire monastic community, will never forget the Lama's teachings."
