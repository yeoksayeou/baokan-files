Dunhuang has discovered several more instances of artifact theft. The investigation is proceeding urgently.

The reporter learned today from the Gansu Provincial Department of Culture that on the night of January 13, in addition to the theft of Yuan Dynasty murals from Cave 465 in the Mogao Caves, artifacts from the art storage room, a calligraphy and painting shop, and a general merchandise store warehouse were also stolen.

Cave 465 in the northern area of the Mogao Caves is located on a concrete platform about 5 meters above the ground. From the crime scene, it appears that the aluminum alloy door is still intact, but the criminals used a sharp tool to break through the north side of the adobe wall, entering the outer chamber first, and then breaking into the inner chamber. In addition to stealing part of the murals, the south wall, north wall, and west wall of the cave have 4 sections of murals that were damaged.

After the incident was reported, relevant leaders and experts have arrived at the scene. The investigation is proceeding urgently.

    莫高窟北区的４６５窟在水泥台阶上距地面５米高，从作案现场看，铝合金门尚完好，案犯用利器将门北侧土坯墙打穿，先进入外室，而后又破门入内室。除盗走部分壁画外，该窟的南墙、北墙和西墙的４块壁画遭到破坏。
    案发之后，有关领导和专家已先后抵达现场。侦破工作正在紧张进行中。
