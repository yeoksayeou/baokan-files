The land of Min is ablaze with activity as winter production races against time. The reporter Zhang Mingqing from this newspaper reports from Fuzhou: As winter approaches, the five winter production activities (winter repairs, winter sowing, winter construction, winter reform, and winter protection) in the land of Min are in full swing. The province of Fujian has taken solid steps towards achieving a bumper harvest this year.

Expanding scale, increasing investment, and accelerating progress are the prominent features of Fujian's winter water conservancy projects. Currently, the province mobilizes 568,000 laborers daily, a 52% increase from last year, completing 21.41 million workdays, a 98% increase from the same period last year. So far, the province has completed 1.34 billion yuan in water conservancy special funds, with 80 million yuan coming from township and village self-raised funds, accounting for 60% of the total investment. These funds come mainly from township and village discretionary funds, various forms of collective fundraising, township and village enterprise subsidies for agriculture, farmers' labor compensation in kind, and overseas Chinese donations. At present, the province has completed 33,000 kilometers of canal dredging, 1,227 kilometers of embankment reinforcement, and 738 water reservoir reinforcements. The 700,000 mu of land damaged by floods has been restored, with improved and newly increased irrigation areas reaching over 1 million mu. All indicators have grown multiple times compared to the same period last year.

Recent winter sowing inspection and evaluation activities in various counties across the province have shown that by the end of last year, the province had completed winter sowing on 6.86 million mu of land, 400,000 mu more than the same period last year. Among these, 2.75 million mu were sown with winter grain crops, 310,000 mu more than the same period last year. The area sown with vegetables exceeded the provincial plan by 15%.

As one of the key forest regions in southern China, Fujian has allocated 2.04 million mu of forest land, accounting for 93% of the artificial afforestation task. The newly opened orchards, vegetable gardens, and the renovation of low-yield vegetable and fruit gardens and low-yield fields have all seen double-digit growth compared to last year. Nanping (formerly Jianyang region) has raised 150 million yuan for mountain development, with collective and individual investments in afforestation reaching 64 million yuan, completing 610,000 mu of forest land construction, with an average investment of 120 yuan per mu. Most parts of the province have implemented the forest protection and fire prevention responsibility system, strengthening the construction of forest protection and fire prevention facilities. Currently, the trend of forest fires in the province is decreasing.

　　八闽大地热火朝天
    五冬生产只争朝夕
    本报福州电  记者张铭清报道：时届隆冬，八闽大地的五冬生产（冬修、冬种、冬建、冬改、冬防）热火朝天，为夺取今年的农业丰收，福建省已迈出了坚实的第一步。
    规模扩大，投入增加，进度加快是福建冬修水利的突出特点。目前全省每天投入的劳力达５６．８万人，比上年增长５２％，累计完成２１４１万个工日，比上年同期增长９８％，目前，全省已完成水利专项投资１．３４亿元，其中乡村和群众自筹资金达８０００多万元，占总投资的６０％，这些资金主要来源是：乡村机动财力、各种集资、乡村企业以工补农款、农民以资抵劳和华侨捐款。如今，全省完成渠道清淤３．３万多公里，堤防加固１２２７公里，水库除险加固７３８处。被水冲毁的７０万亩土地也已得到恢复，改善和新增灌溉面积达１００多万亩，各项指标均比去年同期成倍增长。
    最近各地县普遍开展的冬种验收评比活动表明，到去年底止，全省已完成冬种６８６万多亩，比上年同期多４０万亩，其中冬种粮食作物已达２７５万多亩，比上年同期多３１万亩，蔬菜种植面积超过省计划１５％。
    作为我国南方的重点林区，福建已落实林地２０４万亩，占人工造林任务的９３％，新开的果园、菜园、改造低产菜果园和低产田都比上年成两位数增长。南平（原建阳地区）筹资１．５亿元用于山地开发，其中集体和个人投入造林资金达６４００万元，完成林地建设６１万亩，亩均投入１２０元，全省大部分地方都落实了护林防火责任制，加强了护林防火设施建设。目前全省森林火灾呈下降趋势。
