A heavy snowfall has draped the "Golden Prague" in a silver coat, adding to the charm of this beautiful ancient city. On Wenceslas Square, Wenceslas IV, riding a steed, overlooks the bustling crowd from in front of the National Museum. Perhaps he is asking his fellow countrymen if they are satisfied with the past year? And what are their plans for the new year?

Looking back at the past year, the economic reform that has already begun and the progress of social democratization have brought changes to the country's appearance.

The 17th Congress of the Czechoslovak Communist Party held in March 1986 determined the strategy of accelerating macro-social and economic development, proposing the ambitious goal of increasing national income by two-thirds by the end of the century, and decided to reform the planning and management system. After Jakesh was elected as the General Secretary of the Central Committee of the Czechoslovak Communist Party, he proposed the tasks of accelerating the comprehensive reform of the economic mechanism and deepening socialist democracy. Over the past year, the Party and the government have done a lot of solid work in this regard.

Famous economic commentator Smutny told the reporter that a characteristic of Czechoslovakia's economic reform is the emphasis on legislation. Legislation first ensures that specific measures for economic reform have rules to follow, which is a guarantee for the smooth development of economic reform. Over the past year, based on the 37 principles of economic mechanism reform, a series of draft laws for reforming the economic mechanism have been formulated and submitted for public discussion, and then discussed and approved by the parliament. For example, the "State-Owned Enterprise Law," "Agricultural Cooperative Law," and "Production, Consumption, and Housing Cooperative Law" were all created in this way. These laws came into effect on July 1, 1988. During the discussion of these draft laws, the public submitted more than 100,000 opinions, which shows that the people are concerned about the reform.

Another characteristic is the trial of economic system reform. The new system was first tested in two joint enterprises, accumulating experience, and then gradually expanding. Now, the number of enterprises participating in the trial has reached 600, and it has expanded from the industrial sector to the service industry. On this basis, the new system will be fully implemented starting in 1990.

What are the differences between the new system and the old system? Smutny said that there are mainly three aspects. First, in terms of planning. In the past, the management was divided into three levels: ministries, general management (i.e., joint enterprises), and enterprises, with detailed plans issued at each level, leaving little autonomy for the enterprises; under the new system, the general management level is abolished, and the autonomy of the enterprises is expanded, with the ministries only issuing general planning indicators, and the enterprises formulating detailed plans based on their specific situations and the needs of consumers. Secondly, the enterprises implement full economic accounting and are responsible for their own profits and losses. In the past, 90% of the profits created by the enterprises were handed over to the state treasury, while under the new system, only 50% is handed over, with the rest being fully controlled by the enterprises themselves. At the same time, the income of the workers is linked to the profits of the enterprises, which makes the workers more concerned about the production of the enterprises. Third, the management agencies are greatly streamlined, with the first step being a 40% reduction, and a further 20% reduction later.

The Czechoslovak Party and government believe that without political democratization, economic reform cannot be successful. Therefore, while implementing the reform of the economic mechanism, they proposed the task of deepening socialist democracy. In addition to major issues such as legislation being discussed by the masses, another important measure is to implement differential elections. The Party's organizations implement secret ballots and differential elections. To change the phenomenon of the Party replacing the government and the Party and government not being separate, the "departmental principle" is implemented to fully play the role of the departments. The elected factory directors, regardless of whether they are Party members, have full authority to manage the enterprises. This is a revolutionary change.

The road of reform will not be smooth, and Czechoslovak comrades do not hide the existing problems and shortcomings. The eighth five-year plan starting from 1986 had poor implementation in the first few years. In the first three quarters of 1988, one-quarter of the enterprises did not complete the plan. The main reasons for these problems are the coexistence of the new and old systems. In addition, some planning indicators are set too high, deviating from reality. Recently, the government made a decision that enterprises that do not complete the plan cannot receive bonuses. Some people are not satisfied with this decision. After all, people have lived under the old system for too long. A part of the people are not mentally prepared. This is also one of the obstacles to reform.

Despite various problems, Czechoslovak comrades are confident in the reform path they have taken. Comrade Jeninek, Director of the International Department of the Red Right Newspaper, said: Every socialist country has its own specific conditions. We have not taken the Polish road, do not intend to take the Hungarian road, and are not prepared to completely copy the Soviet Union's approach; we want to take the Czechoslovak-style reform road.

　　捷克斯洛伐克改革一瞥
    本报记者  许宏治
    一场大雪给“金色的布拉格”披上了银装，使这座美丽古城又增添了几分姿色。瓦茨拉夫广场上，骑着骏马的瓦茨拉夫四世从民族博物馆前俯视着熙熙攘攘的人群。他也许在问他的同胞，对过去的一年是否感到满意？在新的一年里，有什么新的打算？
    回顾过去的一年，已经起步的经济体制改革和社会民主化的进展，给国家的面貌带来了变化。
    １９８６年３月召开的捷共１７大确定了加速宏观社会经济发展的战略，提出了到本世纪末国民收入增长２／３的宏伟目标，并决定对计划和管理体制进行改革。雅克什当选捷共中央总书记后，提出了加速经济机制综合改革和深化社会主义民主的任务。一年来，党和政府在这方面做了许多扎实的工作。
    著名经济评论家斯穆特内告诉记者，捷克斯洛伐克经济改革的一个特点是重视立法。立法先行，使经济改革的具体措施有章可循，这是推动经济改革顺利发展的保证。一年来，根据经济机制改革３７条原则，制定了一系列改革经济机制的法律草案，并提交全民讨论，然后由议会讨论通过。例如，《国营企业法》、《农业合作社法》、《生产、消费和住房合作社法》等都是这样产生的。这些法律已于１９８８年７月１日正式生效。在讨论这些法律草案的过程中，人民群众共提出１０万多条意见，由此可见，群众对改革是关心的。
    另一特点是进行经济体制改革的试点。新体制首先在两家联合企业进行试验，积累经验，然后逐步扩大。现在，参加试验的企业已达６００家，并且从工业领域扩展到服务行业。在逐步扩大试验的基础上，将从１９９０年起全面推行新体制。
    那么，新体制和旧体制的区别何在呢？斯穆特内说，主要有三个方面。首先是计划方面。过去，实行部、总管理处（即联合企业）、企业三级管理，层层下达计划，规定得很细，企业自主权不大；在新体制下，撤销总管理处一级，企业的自主权得到扩大，部里只下达大致的计划指标，详细计划由企业根据自己的具体情况和消费者的需要来制定。其次是实行企业的完全经济核算，自负盈亏。过去，企业创造的利润９０％上缴国库，新体制下只上缴５０％，其余全部由企业自己支配。与此同时，职工收入与企业利润挂钩，这使职工更加关心企业的生产。第三是管理机构大大精简，第一步将精简４０％，以后还要再减２０％。
    捷克斯洛伐克党和政府认为，没有政治民主化，经济改革就不能取得成功。因而在实行经济机制改革的同时提出了深化社会主义民主的任务。除立法等重大问题要由群众讨论外，另一个重要措施是实行差额选举。党的机构实行无记名投票和差额选举。要改变以党代政、党政不分的现象，实行“部门原则”，充分发挥部门的作用。当选的厂长不论是否是党员，都有管理企业的全权。这是一次革命性的变革。
    改革的道路不会是平坦的，捷克斯洛伐克同志并不讳言存在的问题和缺点。从１９８６年开始的第８个五年计划，头几年执行情况不好。１９８８年头３个季度，有１／４的企业没有完成计划。出现这些问题的原因主要在于新旧两种体制并存。另外，有些计划指标订得偏高，脱离了实际。不久前，政府作出决定，未完成计划的企业不能发奖金。对于这一决定，有些群众不满。人们毕竟在旧体制下生活得太久了。一部分人思想准备不足。这也是改革遇到的阻力之一。
    尽管有这样那样的问题，捷克斯洛伐克同志对自己走的改革道路很有信心。《红色权利报》国际部主任耶宁内克同志说：每个社会主义国家都有自己的具体条件，我们没有走波兰的道路，不打算走匈牙利的道路，也不准备完全照搬苏联的做法；我们要走的是捷克斯洛伐克式的改革道路。
