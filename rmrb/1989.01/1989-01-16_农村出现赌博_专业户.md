	Rural Areas See Rise in Professional Gamblers
	Editor:
	In recent years, gambling has become prevalent in the rural areas of our county, with an increasing number of participants. These include not only farmers but also workers and cadres. Some lawless elements have taken advantage of this situation to make huge profits, gradually giving rise to professional gamblers. There are already hundreds of such individuals in our county, and their numbers are on the rise. According to investigations, these professional gamblers can be categorized into the following types:

	--- "Habitual Gamblers." These individuals spend the entire year traveling to different places to gamble, avoiding productive labor, and rely on winnings from gambling to support their families.

	--- "Gambling Hosts." These individuals are skilled at gambling and have good family conditions. They often host gambling sessions at home, inviting others to participate. For example, a certain Zhou in one of our county's townships is originally a carpenter who also runs a furniture factory. His business is thriving, making him a well-known "model household" in the area. After getting involved in gambling, he found it easier to make money through gambling, so he began hosting gambling sessions every day, even building high walls and large courtyards to avoid being caught by authorities.

	--- "Gambling Hides." These individuals provide shelter for gamblers in their homes, supplying them with gambling equipment and living services, and acting as lookouts. They usually do not participate in the gambling themselves but take a percentage of the winnings as a "commission." For instance, a certain Dong in one township earns 20 yuan per day from this "commission." This household has been criticized multiple times by the public security authorities but has not shown any signs of reform.

	--- "Con Artists." These individuals pose the greatest harm. They set up private gambling dens, using various methods to lure people into gambling and making huge profits in the process. Some lawless elements exploit people's desire for luck, organizing large-stakes "betting" activities. They tamper with the gambling equipment, causing hundreds of people to fall victim, with winnings and losses often reaching thousands of yuan.

	Editor: The current period is the off-season for farming, which is also the peak season for gambling. We suggest that relevant departments take measures to crack down on gambling activities.

### 农村出现赌博“专业户”

　　农村出现赌博“专业户”
    编辑同志：
    近年来，我县农村赌博现象较为普遍，参赌人员日益增多，不仅有农民，而且有工人和干部。一些不法分子乘机牟取暴利，并逐渐滋生出赌博“专业户”。这类人在我县已有数百名，并有增加趋势。从调查情况看，这些赌博“专业户”主要有以下类型：
    ——“惯赌”。这些人终年四处参与赌博，而不愿参加生产劳动，靠在外参赌赢钱来养家糊口。
    ——“聚赌”。这些人赌技高超，家庭条件较好，常年在家作东聚集别人赌博。如我县某乡周某，原是木匠，家里还开了一个家具厂，生意兴隆，是当地有名的“冒尖户”。自参与赌博活动后，他感到靠赌博赚钱更易，便聚集一些人整日沉溺于赌博，为了防备抓赌者，还盖起了高墙大院。
    ——“窝赌”。常年窝藏一些赌徒在家中赌博，并为他们提供用具和生活服务，同时担任警戒。自己一般不参与，只从赢家提取一定比例收益为“打头子”费。如某乡董某每天“打头子”收入达２０元。该户曾多次受到公安机关批评，但仍不悔改。
    ——“骗赌”。这些人危害最大。他们私设赌场，不择手段地引诱他人参赌，并从中牟取暴利。有的不法分子利用人们碰运气的心理，搞起赌注很大的“押宝”活动。他们在赌具上做手脚，使成百的人上当受骗，输赢往往多达上千元。
    编辑同志：目前正值农闲季节，也是赌博的高峰时期，建议有关部门采取措施打击赌博活动。
