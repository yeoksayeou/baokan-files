The commander-in-chief of the Joint Armed Forces of the Warsaw Pact, Kulikov, announced today that the Soviet Union will begin implementing unilateral troop reductions of 500,000 starting from the first half of this year. This includes withdrawing 6 tank divisions and other units from Eastern European countries. Specifically, 4 tank divisions will be withdrawn from the German Democratic Republic, and 1 tank division each from Czechoslovakia and Hungary.

According to TASS, Kulikov, who also serves as the first deputy minister of the Soviet Union's Ministry of Defense, made this announcement during a meeting with representatives of the Western "Three-Party Committee." The "Three-Party Committee" is a non-governmental organization established to coordinate diplomatic, economic, and social policies among Western Europe, North America, and Japan.

Soviet leader Gorbachev had previously announced on December 7 last year at the United Nations that the Soviet Union would unilaterally reduce its troops by 500,000 within two years and withdraw 6 tank divisions, totaling 50,000 troops and 5,000 tanks, from the German Democratic Republic, Czechoslovakia, and Hungary by 1991.

Kulikov also stated that the Soviet military believes this demonstrates the Soviet Union's sincerity and hopes that the West will respond in kind.

The chief of the Operations Directorate of the Soviet General Staff, General Chervov, clearly announced today that the Soviet troops withdrawn from the German Democratic Republic, Hungary, Czechoslovakia, and Poland will be disbanded rather than transferred to Asia.

In an interview published today in *Komsomolskaya Pravda*, Chervov pointed out that Western speculations about the Soviet troops withdrawn from Eastern European countries being transferred to Asia are groundless. These soldiers will be transferred to the reserves, but young officers will be reassigned to other defense areas.

He said that the Soviet Union will withdraw 2,000 tanks from Eastern Europe, which belong to the 6 tank divisions to be withdrawn. Additionally, 3,000 tanks belong to other divisions that will remain in Eastern Europe. The Soviet Union will also withdraw airborne assault and landing troops from Eastern Europe, making the Soviet troops stationed there more defensive in nature. However, he emphasized that the Soviet Union still retains its strategic nuclear umbrella and has sufficient defensive capabilities.

Chervov admitted that the Warsaw Pact has 20,000 more tanks than NATO. However, he also noted that the U.S. Navy's large warships are twice as strong as the Soviet Navy's, with a total tonnage that is one and a half times higher, and the U.S. Marine Corps has 18 times more personnel, and naval aviation is one and a half times more. In addition to the 16,424 tanks equipped by NATO, there are another 8,000 to 10,000 tanks in storage.

He also criticized NATO for refusing to exchange information on the military potential of the two military blocs with the Soviet Union.

　　苏联宣布从东欧撤军具体计划
    表示不向亚洲转移从东欧撤出的军队
    新华社莫斯科１月１７日电  华沙条约联合武装部队总司令库利科夫今天宣布，苏联将从今年上半年开始实施单方面裁军５０万的措施，包括从东欧国家撤出６个坦克师和其他部队，其中从民主德国撤出４个坦克师，从捷克斯洛伐克和匈牙利各撤出１个坦克师。
    据塔斯社报道，同时兼任苏联国防部第一副部长的库利科夫是在会见西方的“三方委员会”代表团时宣布这一计划的。“三方委员会”是为协调西欧、北美和日本外交、经济和社会政策而建立的非政府组织。
    苏联领导人戈尔巴乔夫去年１２月７日曾在联合国宣布，苏联将在两年内单方面裁军５０万，并在１９９１年前从民主德国、捷、匈３国撤走６个坦克师，计５万军人和５０００辆坦克。
    库利科夫还说，苏联军人认为这表明了苏联的诚意，希望西方予以响应。
    新华社莫斯科１月１７日电　苏军总参谋部局长切尔沃夫上将今天明确宣布，从民主德国、匈牙利、捷克斯洛伐克和波兰撤出的苏联兵团将被解散，而不是转移到亚洲。
    《共青团真理报》今天刊登的切尔沃夫的谈话指出，西方关于从东欧国家撤出的苏军将转移到亚洲的推测是无稽之谈，这些军人将转入预备役，但青年军官将调到别的防区。
    他说，苏联将从东欧撤出的坦克中，有２０００辆属于要撤出的６个坦克师，另外３０００辆属于仍将驻在东欧的其他师。苏联还将从东欧撤出强击空降兵和登陆兵部队，使苏联驻东欧的部队更具有防御性。但他强调，苏联仍保留着战略核盾牌，有足够的防御能力。
    切尔沃夫承认，华约比北约多２万辆坦克。但他又指出，美国海军的大型舰艇比苏联海军的强两倍，总吨位高一倍半，海军陆战队兵员比苏联多１８倍，海军航空兵多一倍半。北约除了装备着的１６４２４辆坦克外，仓库中还有８０００—１万辆坦克。
    他还指责北约拒不同苏联交换两个军事集团的军事潜力情报。
