After the cooling of the business fervor, over 10,000 former farmers who had gone to the city to do business in Bobai County, Guangxi, have returned to their hometowns. They are now enthusiastically engaged in agricultural and livestock farming, becoming well-known farming and livestock experts in the region.

	Bobai County's rural areas once had the saying, "Doing business in the city is better than being a village chief." In recent years, over 25,000 farmers in the county have ventured into business, engaging in trading and peddling. However, due to blind operations, poor management, lack of funds, or outdated information, some farmers have become heavily indebted. In recent years, as some agricultural products have become scarce and farming has gained attention, those who found no prospects in their business ventures have returned to the countryside, focusing on farming and livestock raising.

	Sanzhan Township farmer Liu Jingyun spent two years traveling across half of China, engaging in the trade of traditional Chinese medicine. Due to his lack of understanding of quality standards and outdated information, he often bought high and sold low, making no profit after several years. Therefore, he resolutely returned to his hometown and focused his energy on his seven mu of paddy fields. In the first year, he harvested 9,000 kilograms of rice, becoming a well-known "ton-grain field" expert in the county. At the same time, he leased 10 mu of land, investing over 30,000 yuan to introduce 400 high-quality longan seedlings from a research institute. After two years, the longan trees were laden with fruit, yielding 250,000 yuan. He also insisted on "planting and breeding simultaneously," producing nearly 100,000 high-quality longan seedlings in two years. In 1988, he sold 6,000 seedlings, earning over 300,000 yuan, becoming the famous "Longan King" of the county.

	Hejiang Township's young farmer Chen Hui did business for a year but not only failed to make a fortune but was also cheated out of over 10,000 yuan, feeling extremely frustrated. In early 1987, while actively farming his responsibility fields, he started a poultry farm on a hillside, raising 50,000 chickens. In one year, he earned a pure income of over 150,000 yuan. He deeply felt that "being a 'suitcase merchant' outside is not as good as returning home to do farming and livestock raising!"

	The return of a large number of farmers to farming and livestock raising has promoted the development of the county's agricultural and livestock industries. According to statistics, by the end of November 1988, the county had 3,500 privately-run orchards and forest farms, over 8,000 mu of various fruit orchards, and over 2,300 specialized households raising pigs and chickens.

　　“经商热”降温后
    博白万余农民“解商归田”
    本报南宁电  广西经济报记者庞彩盛、本报记者郑盛丰报道：“经商热”降温后，广西博白县有１１０００多昔日进城做生意的农民重返故土，热心种养致富，成了远近闻名的种养大户。
    博白县农村曾有过“外出做生意，好过当书记”的说法。该县这几年有２５０００多农民干起了闯荡江湖，推销贩运等生意。有些农民由于盲目经营，不善管理，资金缺乏或信息不灵，成了负债大户。而近年来一些农业产品日趋紧俏，种植业受到重视。于是一些外出经商没有奔头的人又纷纷回到了黄土地上，大搞种养业。
    三滩乡农民刘景云，短短２年间，先后跑遍了大半个中国，经营过中药材，由于不懂质量标准，加之信息不灵，大部分是高价买来低价抛出，干了几年不赚分文。因此，他毅然回到家乡，把精力花在７亩水田上，第１年便收得稻谷９０００公斤，他因此一跃成了县内有名的“吨粮田”能手。与此同时，他承包１０亩土地，投资３万多元，从科研单位引种了４００株良种龙眼苗，２年后龙眼果满枝头，收入达２．５万元；他还坚持“种育并举”，２年共育出近１０万株良种龙眼树苗，１９８８年出圃６０００株，共收入３万多元，成了全县有名的“龙眼大王”。
    合江乡青年农民陈辉，做了一年生意，不但捞不到“大世界”，反而被骗走了１００００多元，懊丧不及。１９８７年初，他在积极种好责任田的同时，在山坡上办起了一个饲养肉鸡５万只的养鸡场，一年便纯收入１５０００多元。他深有感触地说：“外出当‘皮包商’，不如回家搞种养！”
    大批农民“解商归田”搞种养之举，推动了全县种养业的发展。据统计，１９８８年１１月底，全县已有民办果园场、林场３５００个，各种果林８０００多亩，有养猪养鸡专业户２３００多户。
