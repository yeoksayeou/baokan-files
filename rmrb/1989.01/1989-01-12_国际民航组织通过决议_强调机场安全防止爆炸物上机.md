The International Civil Aviation Organization's Anti-Hijacking Committee adopted a resolution on the 9th, emphasizing the need to further strengthen airport security to prevent explosives from being brought on board aircraft.

Fred Neil, the British representative to the organization, told reporters that the International Civil Aviation Organization had previously focused mainly on preventing hijackings, as that was the primary threat. Now, the new and extremely frightening idea of placing bombs on aircraft has become a new factor in strengthening aviation security.

Neil said that the Pan Am Boeing 747 aircraft that was blown up over Scotland last December prompted the International Civil Aviation Organization to decide to take measures to further strengthen airport security. In that air disaster, all 258 people on board were killed.

The Anti-Hijacking Committee will submit specific recommendations to the 33-member Council for approval. The headquarters of the International Civil Aviation Organization is located in Montreal, Canada, with over 150 countries participating.

　　国际民航组织通过决议
    强调机场安全防止爆炸物上机
    新华社渥太华１月１０日电  国际民用航空组织的反非法干扰委员会９日通过建议，强调进一步加强机场安全，防止爆炸物被装上飞机。
    英国驻该组织的代表弗雷德·尼尔对记者说，国际民航组织的注意力过去主要集中在防止劫持问题上，因为那是主要威胁。现在向飞机上放置炸弹这种极为可怕的新主意，已经成了加强民航安全方面的新因素。
    尼尔说，去年１２月泛美航空公司一架波音７４７客机在苏格兰上空被炸事件，促使国际民航组织决定采取措施，进一步加强机场安全。在那次空难中，机上所有２５８人全部丧生。
    反非法干扰委员会将把具体建议提交３３国理事会审批。国际民航组织总部设在加拿大的蒙特利尔市，有１５０多个国家参加。
