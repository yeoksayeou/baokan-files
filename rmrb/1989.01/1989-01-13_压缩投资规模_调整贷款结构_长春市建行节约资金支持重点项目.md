Changchun City Construction Bank has diligently implemented the "three guarantees and three compressions" policy, assisting enterprises in meticulously planning investments for key projects, ensuring that limited funds are used for production projects that are urgently needed by the state. By the end of October 1988, the bank had saved 25.59 million yuan in investments and balanced a 54 million yuan investment gap.

	•	Adjusting the investment structure to ensure funds for industrial production projects. The main plant building of Changchun Thermal Power Plant is a critical component for ensuring the first unit's power generation by 1990, with a planned investment of 110 million yuan. To ensure sufficient funds for this project, the city's Construction Bank worked with the unit to adjust the investment for various sub-projects, reducing the non-urgent 1420 square meter clubhouse project and saving 8 million yuan in investment. The First Automobile Works also adopted the bank's suggestion of "first industrial, then civilian, first key, then general," reducing civilian project investments by 15.03 million yuan and cutting the construction area by 148,417 square meters, ensuring the funds needed for production projects.

	•	Utilizing the bank's functions to support key engineering projects with credit funds. The Changchun East Suburb Gas Project is a key project of concern to the entire city. In 1988, the project had a significant investment gap, and the city's Construction Bank, after extensive fundraising, issued a temporary loan of 80 million yuan, alleviating the project's investment shortfall and accelerating the project's progress.

	•	Conducting on-site offices to help enterprises solve problems. By the end of October 1988, members of the city's Construction Bank's key project leadership team had conducted on-site offices 760 times, held 150 on-site office meetings, and had 11 rationalization suggestions adopted by units, saving 18.1 million yuan in investments. For the Changchun Department Store expansion project, which planned to add a new boiler on top of the existing two boilers and expand the original boiler room, requiring an investment of 50 million yuan, the city's Construction Bank suggested modifying the existing boilers to increase the space height. After the design department's review, it met the design requirements, saving the state 20 million yuan in investment.

	•	Assisting in the implementation of the investment contract responsibility system. In 1988, the bank assisted in implementing the investment contract responsibility system for 4 construction projects, with a total contract value of 167.09 million yuan, saving the state 7.4 million yuan in funds. After implementing the investment contract responsibility system for the Changchun Bus Factory expansion project, not only was the project's progress promoted, but it also saved more than 9 million yuan in investment.

　　压缩投资规模　调整贷款结构
    长春市建行节约资金支持重点项目
    本报讯  长春市建设银行认真执行“三保三压”方针，协助企业对重点项目投资精打细算，把有限的资金用在国家急需的生产项目建设上。截至１９８８年１０月末，已节约投资２５５９万元，平衡投资缺口５４００万元。
    ——调整投资结构，保证工业生产项目资金。长春热电总厂的主厂房工程是保证１９９０年第一机组发电的关键部分，计划投资１．１亿元，为保证该工程有足够的资金，市建行与该单位一起对各单项工程投资进行了调整，削减了不急需的１４２０平方米的俱乐部项目，节省投资８０万元。第一汽车制造厂也采纳了市建行提出的“先工用，后民用，先重点，后一般”的建议，将民用项目投资压缩１５０３万元，削减施工面积１４８４１７平方米，保证了生产项目资金的需要。
    ——发挥职能作用，利用信贷资金支持重点工程建设。长春市东郊煤气工程是全市人民关心的重点工程，１９８８年投资缺口很大，市建行经多方筹集资金发放临时性贷款８００万元，缓解了项目投资不足，加快了工程进度。
    ——开展现场办公，为企业排忧解难。截至１９８８年１０月末，市建行重点工程领导小组同志共深入现场办公７６０多人次，召开现场办公会１５０多次，提合理化建议被单位采纳１１项，节约投资１８１万元。长春百货大楼扩建工程计划在原有两台锅炉的基础上再增设一台新锅炉，并准备将原有锅炉房增高、加宽，需投资５０万元，经市建行建议将原有锅炉进行改造，增加空间高度。经设计部门评审达到设计要求，为国家节约投资２０万元。
    ——协助推行投资包干经济责任制。１９８８年共协助对４个建设项目实行了概算投资包干，包干总值为１６７０９万元，为国家节约资金７４０万元。长春客车厂扩建工程实行投资包干后，不仅促进了工程进度，而且还节约投资９０多万元。
