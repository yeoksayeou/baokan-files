On November 30, 1988, Fidel Castro flew to Mexico City. This was his first visit to Mexico City as the Chairman of the State Council and the Council of Ministers of Cuba in 32 years, to attend the inauguration of Mexico's new President Carlos Salinas and to meet with other leaders of Latin American countries. Earlier in August, Castro made his first visit to Ecuador in 17 years, traveling to Quito to attend the inauguration ceremony of President Rodrigo Borja. These two unusual visits indicate that Cuba is actively adjusting its foreign policy, seeking to improve relations with other Latin American countries, and striving to promote unity and cooperation among Latin American nations.

In January 1962, Cuba was expelled from the Organization of American States. In July 1964, the organization passed a resolution to collectively sanction Cuba. By the end of the year, except for Mexico, other Latin American countries had successively severed diplomatic relations with Cuba. However, starting from the 1970s, Cuba gradually restored relations with Latin American countries, and by the 1980s, this process accelerated. Currently, Cuba has maintained diplomatic relations with the vast majority of Latin American countries. In November 1987, the eight-nation group of Latin America held its first summit in Acapulco, Mexico, and called for the re-admission of Cuba to the Organization of American States. This shows that Cuba's status in Latin America has significantly improved. Economic and trade relations, cultural and technological cooperation, and personnel exchanges between Cuba and countries like Brazil, Argentina, and Uruguay have also increased.

After the signing of the Central American Peace Agreement, Cuba promptly adjusted its policy towards Central America. Since 1988, Cuban leaders have repeatedly expressed support for the political resolution of conflicts in the region, stating that Cuba is prepared to withdraw its military advisors from Nicaragua and supports dialogue and agreements between the Salvadoran guerrillas and the government.

At the same time, Cuba's significant adjustment of its policy towards Southern Africa has been praised by the international community. Cuba sent regular troops to Angola in 1975 and has maintained this presence to date. Previously, Cuba insisted on not withdrawing troops from Angola until Namibia gained independence and South Africa abolished the apartheid system. Since the second half of 1987, in response to changing circumstances, Cuba has adopted a more flexible attitude towards withdrawing troops from Angola, indicating a willingness to participate in relevant negotiations and consider phased withdrawals. In early 1988, Cuba participated in the Luanda tripartite talks with Angola and the United States to discuss the peaceful resolution of the Southern African issue. After several rounds of tough negotiations and concessions from all parties, on December 22, the foreign ministers of Angola, Cuba, and South Africa formally signed an agreement in New York regarding the withdrawal of Cuban troops from Angola and the independence of Namibia. Starting from April 1, 1989, Cuba will withdraw all 50,000 of its troops from Angola over 27 months. The 13-year-long conflict in Angola is expected to end, and the situation in Southern Africa will gradually ease.

Over the past year, the long-tense and confrontational relationship between Cuba and the United States has begun to ease, showing some signs of relaxation. On November 20, 1987, Cuba and the United States simultaneously announced the resumption of the 1984 bilateral immigration agreement. According to the agreement, the United States will issue 27,000 visas annually for Cubans to reside in the United States, and Cuba will agree to deport 2,746 Cuban immigrants deemed "unwelcome" by U.S. authorities. Diplomatic sources revealed that the immigration agreement is being smoothly implemented. Cuba has also agreed to the resumption of U.S. flights to the Cuban Interests Section to deliver goods and has received a large delegation of U.S. business representatives. Exchanges in the fields of culture, science, and health between the two countries have begun to resume. Cuba has expressed its readiness for dialogue with the United States but emphasizes that it should be based on mutual respect, the lifting of the U.S. embargo, and the withdrawal of the U.S. from Guantanamo Bay, which the United States finds difficult to accept at present. It seems that the improvement of Cuban-American relations will be slow and arduous, and normalization of relations is unlikely in the short term.

Cuba-Soviet relations have always been close. Trade with the Soviet Union accounts for 80% of Cuba's foreign trade, and the trade volume in 1988 is estimated to be 9 billion pesos. However, starting from 1987, Cuba's imports from the Soviet Union have decreased, and the supply of Soviet oil has also been reduced. The two countries' relations are also undergoing adjustments.

Cuba was the first Latin American country to establish diplomatic relations with China 28 years ago, and the two countries' relations have been tumultuous. Over the past two years, relations between China and Cuba have gradually improved. Currently, the relations between the two parties have been restored, and exchanges in the fields of trade, culture, sports, education, and technology between the two countries have become increasingly close.

The aforementioned changes in Cuba's foreign relations, on the one hand, are occurring in the context of the international situation shifting from tension to relaxation and from confrontation to dialogue. On the other hand, it is also a response to the development of Cuba's domestic and international situation. Additionally, the strengthening of the trend towards independence, self-reliance, and unity among Latin American countries in recent years has played a certain role in promoting these changes.

　　古巴对外关系的新变化
    管彦忠
    去年１１月３０日，菲德尔·卡斯特罗飞抵墨西哥城。这是他相隔３２年之后作为古巴国务委员会和部长会议主席首次到墨西哥城访问，参加墨西哥新总统卡洛斯·萨利纳斯的就职典礼，同时会见其他拉美国家的领导人。在此之前的８月，卡斯特罗对南美洲的厄瓜多尔进行了１７年来的第一次访问，到基多出席罗德里戈·博尔哈总统的就职仪式。这两次非同寻常的出访活动，表明古巴在对外政策的调整中，主动改善与其他拉美国家的关系，努力促进拉美国家的团结合作。
    １９６２年１月，古巴被排斥在美洲国家组织之外。１９６４年７月，该组织通过了集体制裁古巴的决议，到年底除了墨西哥，其他拉美国家先后与古巴断交。但是从７０年代开始，古巴逐渐地恢复了与拉美国家的关系，到了８０年代则明显加快了步伐。到目前，古巴已和绝大多数拉美国家保持着外交关系。１９８７年１１月，拉美八国集团在墨西哥阿卡普尔科举行第一次首脑会议时，要求美洲国家组织重新接纳古巴，这说明古巴在拉美的地位已有很大改善。古巴和巴西、阿根廷、乌拉圭等国的经济贸易关系、文化科技合作和人员往来也在增加。
    在中美洲和平协议签署之后，古巴及时调整了对中美洲的政策。１９８８年以来，古巴领导人多次宣布支持中美洲国家政治解决该地区的冲突的主张，表示古巴准备从尼加拉瓜撤出它的军事顾问，同时支持萨尔瓦多游击队与政府对话和达成协议。
    与此同时，古巴大幅度调整对南部非洲问题的政策也受到了国际社会的赞许。古巴于１９７５年向安哥拉派出正规部队并延续至今。过去，古巴坚持在纳米比亚独立和南非取消种族隔离制度之前，绝不从安哥拉撤军。１９８７年下半年以来根据形势的变化，古巴对从安哥拉撤军采取较灵活的态度，表明愿意参加有关的谈判和考虑分阶段撤军。１９８８年初，古巴参加了安哥拉、美国的罗安达三方会谈，讨论和平解决南部非洲问题。经过多次艰苦谈判和各方作出让步，１２月２２日安哥拉、古巴、南非３国外长在纽约正式签署了关于古巴从安哥拉撤军和纳米比亚独立的协议。从１９８９年４月１日起古巴将在２７个月内把它在安哥拉的５万名军队全部撤走。持续了１３年的安哥拉战乱可望结束，南部非洲局势将逐步走向缓和。
    一年多来，长期处于紧张和对峙状态的古美关系开始松动，并出现某些缓解的迹象。１９８７年１１月２０日，古巴和美国同时宣布恢复执行１９８４年签署的双边移民协定。根据协定，美国每年向古巴发放２．７万张旅居美国的签证，古巴同意遣返美国当局认为“不受欢迎的”２７４６名古巴移民。据外交人士透露，移民协定正顺利执行。古巴还同意美国专机恢复向驻古利益照管处运送物品，接待了庞大的美国商人代表团的访问，两国在文化、科学、卫生等方面的来往开始恢复。古巴表示已作好同美国进行对话的准备，但强调应在相互尊重、美国取消封锁和撤出关塔那摩基地的基础上举行，这是美国一时难以接受的。看来古美关系的改善将是缓慢而艰难的，短期内不大可能实现关系正常化。
    古苏关系历来是密切的。对苏贸易占古巴对外贸易的８０％，１９８８年贸易额估计达９０亿比索。但从１９８７年开始，古巴从苏联的进口额有所下降，苏联供应的石油也减少了。两国关系也在调整之中。
    古巴是２８年前与中国建交的第一个拉美国家，两国关系走过了曲折的路。近２年来，中古两国的关系逐步改善。目前中古两党的关系已经恢复，双方在贸易、文化、体育、教育、科技等领域的交往日益密切。
    古巴对外关系的上述变化，一方面是在国际局势由紧张转向缓和、从对抗转向对话的背景下发生的，另一方面也是古巴内外形势发展的需要。此外，近年来拉美国家独立自主、团结合作趋势的加强也起了一定的推动作用。
