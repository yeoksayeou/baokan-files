Title: A Re-examination of the Beijing Hiring Phenomenon

The phenomenon of hiring workers, once considered exploitative, has now become widespread. Not only do many individual entrepreneurs hire workers, but even state-owned and collective enterprises hire rural labor from other provinces under the guise of "unemployed youth." The influx of these hired workers into the capital has grown rapidly, forming numerous labor markets that have caught the old management system off guard, leaving it in a state of indecision—wanting to relax controls but afraid to, wanting to stop but unable to.

The Dilemma of the Public Security Department

The influx and spontaneous movement of hired workers have given the public security departments in the capital a major headache.

Last summer, police from the Jian Guo Men Substation discovered 17 male and female hired workers living together in one room during a night patrol. Upon investigation, only 6 of them had obtained temporary residence permits; the rest were "black" workers who came and went without a trace.

The Jian Guo Men Interchange Nanny Market is the largest labor market in Beijing, where employers and rural laborers freely "trade" without medical examinations, inspections, or registrations. As a result, incidents of employers being cheated or workers being harassed occur almost daily. The public security departments in the Dong Cheng, Chao Yang, Chong Wen, and Beijing Railway Station areas have conducted several joint inspections, although some hidden dangers were discovered, the outcomes were ultimately inconclusive.

Young female police officer Yan Yu Hua from the Jian Guo Men Substation told me that to protect the rights of both employers and hired workers and to maintain public security in the capital, Beijing is currently experimenting with the "shop registration" system.

The "shop registration" system differs from temporary residence permits. Shop owners who hire helpers must register the details of their hired workers with the police station within a week; if they dismiss them, they must immediately come to cancel the registration. This has been crucial for the public security department in keeping track of outsiders, promptly handling disputes, and preventing criminal activities.

Currently, the "shop registration" system is only being piloted in a few districts and does not have legal regulations. During the pilot, some employers find it troublesome and do not register, while others falsify information.

The Difficulties of the Management Department

The industrial and commercial departments have always managed individual entrepreneurs and have subsequently taken on the management of hired workers. However, they only register the number of hired workers, and even the actual number of hired workers is difficult to ascertain.

The head of the Chao Yang Men Industrial and Commercial Bureau, Wu Lie Zhong, told me that this area has about 80 individual shops, with approximately 200 registered hired workers, but the actual number of hired workers far exceeds this figure.

Hired workers are required to register with the industrial and commercial, public security, and labor departments and undergo a medical examination. Completing these procedures takes at least half a month. However, hired workers are highly mobile, staying for a few months at most, or just three to five days. They are unwilling to spend time on registrations. Moreover, competition among hired workers is fierce; if you diligently complete the registrations, your job might be taken by someone else by the time you finish.

Starting from April last year, the Beijing Municipal Labor Bureau began managing hired workers. They implemented the "employment book" system to register the number of urban hired workers. However, due to the difficulty of this work, the number of rural hired workers, who make up the majority, has not yet been counted.

Zhang Xin Qing, a staff member of the Municipal Labor Bureau, discussed this issue, saying that most problems among hired workers arise from not signing contracts, not taking responsibility, and the lack of mutual restraint. The State Council issued several simple regulations on this matter in 1987, but there are no specific provisions, no policies for hired workers, and the labor management system is not complete. Under these circumstances, issues such as "job-hopping" among hired workers, employers abusing hired workers, and hired workers having no recourse for complaints are inevitable.

The Bosses' Methods

The owner of Hai Xing Restaurant near Beijing Railway Station North Gate, Pang Xue Yi, was originally a street office cadre. He manages his business well, attracting a large number of domestic and foreign customers.

I asked him in the restaurant, "How many helpers have you hired?" He smiled and said, "Six, all from other provinces, very capable."

"How many hours do they work each day?" "Nine hours. Rest time is scattered in the morning, afternoon, and after dinner."

Pang, the boss, hires people by first trying them out for half a month. If they are good, he keeps them on, sometimes for two or three years. He subscribes to three newspapers for the hired workers, allows them to watch TV in the evenings, and regularly lectures them on legal knowledge. Starting from 1989, Pang, the boss, will also establish labor insurance for them.

I asked, "Do you sign contracts with them?" He replied, "Our relationship is very good, why sign contracts?"

The owner of Yue Bin Restaurant is a young man, and his father, who has been suspended from work, also participates. This elderly man said that he has been managed by leaders all his life, but now he is the owner of the restaurant. He openly posts notices to hire workers, provides uniforms for the hired workers, and reimburses medical expenses. Some college students want to come and carry trays, but he disagrees. He said, "We don't want temporary workers."

The bosses have their own methods, and some are indeed fair and reasonable. However, all methods lack legal constraints. This makes it difficult to ensure that the bosses' "policies" do not change.

### 北京雇工现象再探

　　北京雇工现象再探
    本报记者  袁建达
    雇工曾被认为是剥削行为，人们听起来都害怕。如今，不仅许多个体户雇工，连国营、集体企业也用“待业青年”的名义雇佣外地农村劳动力。外地雇工到京城，如滚雪球，很快形成许多劳务市场，使旧的管理体制措手不及，欲放不敢，欲罢不能。
    　　　　治安部门的困惑
    雇工的大量涌入和自发流动，使首都公安部门大伤脑筋。
    去年夏天，建国门派出所民警在一次夜查中，发现１７名男女雇工混居一室。经审查，这些人中只有６人办了暂住证，其他都是来无影、去无踪的“黑人”。
    建国门立交桥保姆市场是北京最大的劳务市场，雇主和外地劳力自由“交易”，不需体检，不受审查，不用登记。于是，这里几乎每天都发生雇主受骗或雇工被污辱的事。北京市东城、朝阳、崇文和北京站地区四家公安机关几次联合清查，虽然发现一些隐患，最后都不了了之。
    建国门派出所年轻的女民警阎玉华告诉我，为了保护雇主和雇工双方的权益，维护首都治安，北京市正在试行“店铺户口”。
    “店铺户口”不同于暂住户口。雇佣帮工的店主必须在一周内将雇工情况到派出所登记；如解雇，则必须立即前来注销。这对治安部门掌握外来人员情况，及时处理发生的纠纷，预防刑事犯罪，起了重要的作用。
    “店铺户口”目前只在几个区试行，还没有法律规定。试行中发现，因此，有的雇主嫌麻烦不去登记，有的冒名顶替、胡编乱造。
    　　　　管理部门的难处
    工商部门一直管理个体户，后来也顺带管理起了雇工。但是，他们只是登记雇工的人数。而且，连雇工的真实人数，也很难掌握。
    东城区朝阳门工商所负责人邬烈中告诉我，这个地区有８０来家个体店铺，登记的雇工约２００人，实际雇工远远超过这个数。
    雇工按要求必须到工商、公安、劳动部门登记注册，还要到医院体检。办这些手续，起码要半个多月。而雇工流动性极大，多则干几个月，少的仅干三五天，他们不肯在登记上花工夫。再说，雇工之间竞争也很激烈，你若老老实实去忙登记的事，等到登记完了，饭碗可能早被别人抢走了。
    从去年４月开始，北京市劳动局开始管理雇工。他们试行“用工簿”制度，登记城镇雇工人数。由于这项工作才开始，难度又极大，因而占雇工人数大头的农村雇工人数至今还没统计上来。
    市劳动局干部张欣庆谈到这个问题时说，雇工中发生的问题，大多是不订合同，不负责任，双方都没有约束力所致。国务院１９８７年曾对此作过几条简单的规定，但既没有具体条文，又没有雇工政策，劳动管理办法也不健全。在这种状况下，雇工中发生的“跳槽”现象，雇主虐待雇工、雇工有苦无处投诉等等也就在所难免了。
    　　　　老板们的办法
    北京站北口的海兴餐馆老板庞学义，原是街道办事处干部。他经营有方，吸引了大批中外顾客。
    我在店堂里问他：“雇了几名帮工？”他笑着说：“６名，都是外省青年，很能干。”
    “每天工作几小时？”“９小时。休息时间分散在早晨、下午和晚饭后的空档。”
    庞老板雇人，都是先试用半个来月，觉得行，就留下干，一干便是二三年。给雇工们订了３种报纸，允许晚上看电视，还定期对他们讲法律方面的知识。从１９８９年起，庞老板还要给他们建立劳动保险。
    我问：“双方签订合同吗？”他答：“大家关系都挺好，签什么合同？”
    悦宾餐馆老板是位年轻人，他父亲停职后也参与其事。这位老人说，他一辈子都被领导管，如今成了餐馆的主人，他公开张榜招雇工，给录用的雇工发工作服、报销医药费。有的大学生想来端盘子，他不同意。他说：“我们不要临时的。”
    老板们各有各的办法，有的确实是公道的、合理的。但是，所有的办法都没有法律的约束。这就很难保证老板们“政策”不变了。
