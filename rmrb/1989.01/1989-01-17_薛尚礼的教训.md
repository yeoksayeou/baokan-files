Xue Shangli, the director of Shanghai Refrigerator Factory No. 2, abused his authority to accept bribes totaling 120,000 yuan, and was eventually investigated by the procuratorate and detained by relevant departments. This incident is worth deep reflection for enterprise leaders.

Since the reform and opening up, enterprises have gradually gained more autonomy, and the status of enterprise leaders has also risen accordingly. For pioneers, power is a tool for achieving success, but for those who are insatiable, it becomes an instrument for personal gain. Looking at reality calmly, although the vast majority of factory directors and managers regard their work as the driving force of their lives, there are still a few who use their enterprise's power for personal gain.

Are there not such factory directors and managers who either sell scarce products like color TVs and refrigerators at low prices to unscrupulous merchants, making huge kickbacks in the process; or discard domestic high-quality equipment, opting instead to import from abroad, using the opportunity to travel overseas, and even go so far as to spend a high price to give foreign businessmen valuable foreign exchange, taking a cut from it? Recently, a batch of economic cases handled by Guangdong's supervisory authorities included some where the leaders of import and export enterprises sold national interests, took bribes, and opened accounts in foreign banks. It seems that developing a commodity economy both trains people and tests them. Money, desire, beauty... the colorful dyes can turn someone who originally valued their career into someone with a completely different face.

In recent years, the media has said many "good things" about factory directors and managers. On the one hand, this is to help enterprises overcome obstacles in their progress; on the other hand, it is also to speak out for the long-term powerless situation of enterprises. However, amidst the "good talk," enterprise leaders must not become complacent and must always regard the development of the enterprise as their mission, striving to open up new paths, without the slightest thought of turning power into personal gain. The lesson of Xue Shangli serves as a warning.

　　薛尚礼的教训
    雨晴
    上海冰箱二厂厂长薛尚礼利用职权，接受贿赂１．２万元，终被检察院侦破，已被有关部门拘留。这一事件值得企业领导的深思。
    改革开放以来，企业自主权日渐增多，企业领导的地位也随之提高。权力对于开拓者来说是成就事业的斤斧，而对于贪得无厌者，却是揩油的利器。冷静地看现实，尽管绝大多数厂长、经理把事业作为人生的动力，可毕竟有极少数人却以企业之权谋取私利。
    不是有这样的厂长、经理吗，他们或把彩电、冰箱等紧俏产品低价转批给不法商贩，从中大捞回扣；或把国产的优质设备弃之一旁，转而向国外进口，借机出国旅游，更有甚者，不惜高价奉送外商宝贵的外汇，从中抽头。最近，广东监察机关查处的一批经济案件中，就有一些是进出口企业领导人出卖国家利益，索取贿赂，在外国银行大开户头。看来，发展商品经济，既锻炼人，也考验人。金钱、利欲、美色……花花绿绿的染料可以把原本以事业为重的人涂抹得面目全非。
    这几年，舆论界为厂长、经理们说了许多“好话”，这一方面是为了帮助企业克服前进中的障碍，另一方面也是为长期以来企业无权的状况鸣不平。然而，“好话”声中，企业领导切不可飘飘然，必须时时处处以企业发展的大业为己任，奋力开拓，而丝毫存不得变权力为私利的念头。薛尚礼的教训提供了前车之鉴。
