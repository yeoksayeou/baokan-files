The Bo County Committee of Shandong Province attaches great importance to investigation and research, addressing issues that the masses are strongly concerned about, and strengthening party conduct in the context of developing a socialist commodity economy, achieving initial results.

To understand the basic situation of party conduct in the county under the reform and opening-up, from mid-July to early September last year, the county committee organized a team of 20 people to conduct a survey. They used methods such as written questionnaires, holding symposiums, and individual visits, and surveyed 12 townships and 8 county-level systems, with a total of 2,079 people surveyed. The results showed that 71% were satisfied or relatively satisfied with the party conduct. However, there were strong reactions to issues such as a few party members and cadres using their power for personal gain, extravagant spending, and irregularities in the supply of agricultural materials. In response, the county committee decided to address the issues that the masses are strongly concerned about as a breakthrough in rectifying party conduct, and gradually improve the constraints mechanism for party member leaders and cadres. To strengthen supervision, the county discipline inspection commission and supervision bureau established a reporting center.

Regarding the issues of party members and cadres using their power for personal gain and other disciplinary violations, the county committee and the county discipline inspection commission have seriously investigated and dealt with them. Since last year, a total of 27 cases of party disciplinary violations have been investigated and dealt with. One deputy county magistrate who accepted bribes was given a two-year probationary period and removed from his leadership position.

　　注重调查研究　完善制约机制
    博兴县加强对党员干部的监督
    本报讯  山东省博兴县委注重调查研究，针对群众反映强烈的问题，在发展社会主义商品经济条件下加强党风建设，取得初步成效。
    为了摸准全县在改革、开放的形势下党风建设的基本状况，从去年７月下旬到９月初，县委组织了２０人的调查组，采取书面问卷、召开座谈会和个别走访等形式，先后对１２个乡镇和县直８大系统进行党风调查，被调查人数达２０７９人。调查的结果表明，对党风状况满意和比较满意的占７１％。但是对少数党员干部以权谋私、挥霍浪费和农用物资供应中的不正之风反应强烈。对此，县委决定把解决群众反应强烈的问题作为端正党风的突破口，并逐步完善对党员领导干部的制约机制。为了加强监督，县纪委、监察局设立举报中心。
    对于党员干部以权谋私等违纪问题，县委、县纪委认真查处。去年以来共查处党内违纪案件２７起，对１名受贿的副县长给予留党察看两年，撤销领导职务的处分。
