	To solve the problem of mixed traffic on highways, new paths are opened: Cangzhou builds over 100 kilometers of car-only roads in three years

	BEIJING — A highway with various types of fast and slow vehicles traveling simultaneously results in fast vehicles not being able to travel quickly, and slow and fast vehicles interfering with each other. This mixed traffic is a common problem on Chinese highways. The transportation department of Cangzhou region in Hebei Province, after repeated deliberations, decided to start building car-only highways in 1986. In the past three years, they have built 122.63 kilometers, significantly improving the region's transportation capacity and opening a new path to solve the problem of mixed traffic on Chinese highways.

	How to solve the problem of highway congestion and blockages? A traditional view is that if there are many cars, the road will relatively narrow, and if you want to improve transportation capacity, you have to widen the road surface. The transportation department of Cangzhou region holds a different view. They believe that simply widening the road surface cannot fundamentally solve the biggest drawback of Chinese highway traffic—mixed traffic—and it is difficult to improve the car passage capacity.

	In the past three years, the transportation department of Cangzhou region, relying on the attention and support of local governments at all levels and the whole society, has focused on solving the mixed traffic problem and achieved remarkable results.

	After the car-only road was built and opened to traffic, the highway traffic underwent significant changes. Through observation and analysis of the southern section of the Jingfu Road in Cangzhou region, its advantages are specifically reflected in the following aspects: 1. Increased average vehicle speed. The old road had an average speed of 37 kilometers per hour during mixed traffic, while the car-only road had an average speed of 57 kilometers per hour, an increase of 54%. 2. Increased passage capacity. The new road had an average peak traffic volume of 942 vehicles per hour, with a car passage capacity increased by 2.5 times, which is obviously incomparable to mixed traffic. 3. Reduced vehicle transportation costs. According to the calculation methods of relevant departments of the Ministry of Transportation, the average transportation cost per ton-kilometer can be reduced by 0.05 yuan, with an average annual cost reduction benefit of approximately 3.84 million yuan. 4. Saved travel time. At the same time, it also reduced traffic accidents.

　　为解决公路混合交通问题开辟新路
    沧州三年修建汽车专用线百余公里
    本报讯  记者刘国胜报道：一条公路上同时行驶着各种各样快慢车辆，快车跑不快，慢车、快车相互干扰，这种混合交通是我国公路交通普遍存在的大问题。河北省沧州地区交通部门经过反复论证，从１９８６年开始，决定修建汽车专用公路，３年来共修建了１２２．６３公里，大大提高了该地区的交通能力，为解决我国公路混合交通问题开辟了一条新路子。
    如何解决公路交通拥挤、阻塞问题？一种传统的观点是，车多了，路就相对窄了，若想提高交通能力，就得加宽路面。对此，沧州地区交通部门则持不同看法。他们认为，一味加宽路面，不能从根本上解决我国公路交通的最大弊端——混合交通，很难提高汽车通行能力。
    近３年来，沧州地区交通部门依靠各级地方政府及全社会的重视和支持，着力解决混合交通问题，取得显著成效。
    汽车专用路建成通车以后，公路交通发生很大变化。通过对京福路沧州地区南段观测分析，其优点具体表现在以下几点：１、提高了汽车平均行驶速度。旧路混合交通时，汽车平均时速为３７公里，专用路实测平均时速为５７公里，提高５４％。２、提高了通行能力。新路平均高峰时，交通量为９４２辆／小时，汽车通过能力提高２．５倍，混合通行显然无法比拟。３、降低了汽车运输成本。参照交通部有关部门的计算方法，平均每吨公里运输成本可以降低０．０５元，平均每年成本降低效益约３８４万元。４、节约了旅行时间。同时，也减少了交通事故。
