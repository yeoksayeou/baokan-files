The Spring Festival is approaching, and the Hubei Provincial People's Government, along with the Provincial Discipline Inspection Commission, has issued a notice strictly prohibiting all levels of party and government agencies from distributing money and goods, giving and receiving gifts, purchasing "New Year gifts" from grassroots and subordinate units, and using public funds for banquets. The notice states that those who find ways around the rules, set precedents, or do not heed warnings will be subject to party and administrative disciplinary actions, and those who are derelict in their duties will be held accountable.

The Hubei Provincial Party Committee and the Provincial Government have also instructed various levels of discipline inspection, supervision, auditing, taxation, and media organizations to carry out supervisory activities to uphold party and administrative discipline.

According to a report by our reporter, Gong Dafa, and Xinhua News Agency reporter, Fang Zhengjun, Hubei Provincial Governor Guo Zhenqian today at the third expanded meeting of the Provincial Government severely criticized the Provincial Coal Bureau and the Provincial Agriculture and Animal Husbandry Bureau for accepting gifts from grassroots units. He ordered the heads of the two bureaus to promptly investigate and deal with the matter, and required the relevant personnel to conduct a thorough self-examination.

According to the investigation by the Hubei Provincial Supervision Bureau, the Provincial Coal Bureau recently sent a vehicle to Qizhou County's Xiangxi River Mine Bureau to purchase 3,982.5 kilograms of broad-leaved mandarins, with the cost of over 6,500 yuan covered by the Xiangxi River Mine Bureau. At the same time, they accepted 673.5 kilograms of navel oranges worth 2,357 yuan from the mine bureau for the bureau leaders and relevant personnel. Meanwhile, the Coal Bureau also accepted 12.5 tons of lump coal from the Hujiabai Coal Mine of the Huangshi Mine Bureau, which was distributed free of charge to each staff member of the bureau.

Guo Zhenqian also mentioned in the meeting that based on a report from Xuan'en County on January 23, the Supervision Bureau initially found that relevant personnel from the Grain Production Department and the Soil and Fertilizer Technology Promotion Center of the Provincial Agriculture and Animal Husbandry Bureau accepted "corn harvesting technology guidance fee" of 1,000 yuan, 44.5 kilograms of pork, two sheep, 1.5 kilograms of cordyceps, and "contract fee" and "technology guidance fee refund" of 1,345 yuan, totaling 2,937.6 yuan from the Xuan'en County Agricultural Bureau.

Guo Zhenqian demanded that the funds received by the two bureaus be confiscated and turned over to the finance department, and ordered the relevant personnel to promptly refund the amounts.
