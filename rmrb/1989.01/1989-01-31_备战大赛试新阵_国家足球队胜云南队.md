The national football team, which is intensively preparing for the 14th World Cup, defeated the Yunnan football team 2-0 yesterday in Kunming.

This match was the national team's first public appearance after more than a month of intensive training in Kunming. All 23 team members were present. During the game, China's lineup was as follows: goalkeeper Zhang Huikang, defenders Jia Xiuchuan, Gao Sheng, Zhu Bo, and Mai Chao, midfielders Duan Ju and Tang Yaodong, and forwards Liu Haiguang, Guo Yijun, Wu Qunli, and Wang Baoshan. The two goals were scored in the first half, at the 20th and 38th minutes, by Liu Haiguang and Wang Baoshan, respectively. In the second half, the national team substituted in Ma Lin, Zhang Xiaowen, Zhai Biao, Sun Xianlu, and Dong Liqiang, frequently advancing down the wings and crossing the ball, attempting to use Liu Haiguang and Guo Yijun's height to attack the goal. However, several Yunnan defenders tightly marked the two, preventing the national team from scoring.

　　备战大赛试新阵
    国家足球队胜云南队
    据新华社昆明１月３０日电（记者周东棣）正为第十四届世界杯足球赛紧张备战的中国足球队，昨天在昆明以２∶０战胜云南足球队。
    这场比赛是国家队在昆明经过１个多月的紧张集训后的第一次公开亮相。２３名队员全部到齐。比赛中，中国队的排阵门将是张惠康，后卫是贾秀全、高升、朱波、麦超，前卫是段举、唐尧东，前锋则是柳海光、郭亿军、吴群立、王宝山。两个球是上半场２０分钟和３８分钟时，分别由柳海光和王宝山攻入的。下半时，国家队换上马林、张小文、翟飙、孙贤禄、董礼强，频频从边路推进然后传中，力图用柳海光和郭亿军的身高冲击大门，但云南队的几名后卫死死缠住他俩，使国脚一次次无功而返。
