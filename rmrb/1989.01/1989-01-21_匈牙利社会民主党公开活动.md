Hungarian Socialist Party Holds Public Activities

According to the Hungarian News Agency, the newly established Hungarian Socialist Party held its first public meeting in Budapest on the 19th.

The Hungarian Socialist Party, established in 1890, merged with the Hungarian Communist Party in 1948. Recently, an organization named the Hungarian Socialist Party has reappeared in society. The official news agency, Hungarian News Agency, reported on the 19th about the party's meeting.

Last December 16, the General Secretary of the Hungarian Socialist Workers' Party, Grosz, stated that the re-emergence of the Socialist Party, which had merged in 1948, would not be allowed. However, no order to disband this party has been issued to date.

　　匈牙利社会民主党公开活动
    据匈通社报道，新建的匈牙利社会民主党十九日在布达佩斯首次公开举行会议。
    始建于一八九○年的匈牙利社会民主党已于一九四八年同匈牙利共产党合并。不久前，一个名为匈牙利社会民主党的组织又在社会上出现。官方通讯社匈通社十九日报道了这个党举行会议的情况。
    匈牙利社会主义工人党总书记格罗斯去年十二月十六日曾表示，不允许已于一九四八年实行合并的社会民主党再独立出现。然而，迄今未见颁布对这个党的取缔令。
