An American aircraft shot down two Libyan fighter jets over the Mediterranean, leading to a dispute between the United States and the Federal Republic of Germany far from the scene of the incident, which has puzzled and attracted public attention.

The U.S. State Department spokesman claimed that the shooting down of the Libyan fighter jets had nothing to do with the U.S. accusation that Libya's chemical plant was producing chemical weapons. However, at the same time, the U.S. government repeatedly accused West German chemical plants of helping Libya build such a chemical plant. U.S. newspapers also wrote extensively on this issue, even comparing Libya's chemical plant to a "concentration camp in the desert."

The U.S. approach to the Libyan chemical plant issue has irritated West German leaders. Chancellor Kohl had to personally call U.S. President Reagan to express his displeasure over the matter.

The U.S. and West Germany have had disagreements over the Libyan chemical plant issue for some time.

As early as last November 15, the U.S. side told Chancellor Kohl, who was then visiting the United States, that West German companies were involved in the construction of Libya's chemical weapons plant. After returning home, Kohl ordered an investigation, but no evidence has been found to date, and he requested that the U.S. provide leads. However, the United States has yet to produce any evidence.

Local newspapers suspect that U.S. newspapers singling out West Germany for attack is due to the U.S. having "bad feelings" toward West Germany.

In recent times, the U.S. and West Germany have seen growing tensions over issues such as Euro-American trade and East-West relations, creating a "disharmonious atmosphere" in their relations. Last December, the Montreal meeting to adjust Western trade relations under the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade ended in disarray. At the beginning of this year, West Germany took the lead in banning the import of U.S. hormone-treated meat. What is even more unacceptable to the U.S. is that, while the U.S. is busy with its elections and Western strategy against the Soviet Union has not yet formed a consensus, West Germany is actively promoting its Eastern policy. Among Western European countries, it was the first to provide the Soviet Union with a large loan, attempting to be the first to enter the Soviet Union, a potential large market. West Germany also announced that advancing the construction and development of the internal market of the European Community and developing relations with the Soviet Union are the key points of the government's diplomatic work this year.

In addition, West Germany's hesitation on the issue of short-range missile modernization has also made the U.S. dissatisfied.

The discord between German-American relations is a microcosm of Euro-American contradictions. As the interests of both sides continue to clash and East-West relations evolve, this contradiction may further intensify.

　　西德同美国间的不和谐音
    新华社记者  翁振葆
    美国飞机在地中海上空击落了利比亚两架战斗机，导致远离事件发生地点的美国和联邦德国之间发生一场争吵，引起了公众的不解和关注。
    美国国务院发言人声称，击落利比亚战斗机与美国指责利比亚化工厂制造化学武器一事无关。但与此同时，美国官方一再指责联邦德国的化工厂帮助利比亚建立了这样的化工厂，美国报刊更是就此大作文章，甚至把利比亚的化工厂比作“沙漠中的奥斯威辛集中营”。
    美国在利比亚化工厂问题上如此旁敲联邦德国，使联邦德国领导人大为恼火。科尔总理不得不亲自打电话给美国总统里根，对此事表示不悦。
    美国和联邦德国在利比亚化工厂问题上的龃龉已有时日。
    早在去年十一月十五日，美方已对当时正在美国访问的科尔总理说，联邦德国的公司参与了利比亚化学武器工厂的建造工作。科尔回国后下令进行调查，至今未发现任何证据，并请美方提供线索。但美国至今没有拿出证据。
    此间报刊怀疑，美国报刊把攻击矛头单单指向联邦德国是美国对联邦德国“情绪不好”所致。
    一段时间以来，美国和联邦德国在欧美贸易和东西方关系等问题上的矛盾有所发展，使两国关系出现了“不和谐的气氛”。去年十二月，调节西方贸易关系的关税及贸易总协定蒙特利尔会议刚刚不欢而散，今年初联邦德国又带头禁止美国经过激素处理的肉类进口。更令美国难以接受的是，在美国忙于大选、西方对苏战略尚未形成一致意见之时，联邦德国积极推行其东方政策，在西欧国家中率先给苏联提供巨额贷款，企图捷足先登进入苏联这个潜在的大市场。联邦德国还宣布，推进欧共体内部市场的建设和发展对苏关系是政府今年的外交工作重点。
    此外，联邦德国在短导现代化问题上的迟疑态度也使美国不满。
    德美关系的不和谐是欧美矛盾的一个缩影。随着双方利益的不断交锋和东西方关系的发展变化，这种矛盾还可能进一步加剧。
