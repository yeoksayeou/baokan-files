The State Tobacco Monopoly Administration has decided to implement unified management, unified balancing, and unified allocation of tobacco yarn and filter tips starting from this year. The China Tobacco Materials Company will, based on the "four guarantees and four considerations" principle, ensure the supply of name-brand cigarettes, consider high-quality cigarettes, and appropriately arrange the production of other first-grade cigarettes.

Tobacco yarn and filter tips are items under state monopoly management. The State Tobacco Monopoly Administration stipulates that for the import of tobacco yarn and filter tips, except for Hainan Province and the special economic zone cigarette factories for self-use and operated by a designated company with import and export rights, all other provinces, municipalities, and autonomous regions must be handled by the China Tobacco Import and Export Corporation and its subsidiaries. No other foreign trade companies are allowed to engage in this business. Activities such as external inquiries, negotiations, contract signing, and contract execution will also be handled by the China Tobacco Import and Export Corporation.

The State Tobacco Monopoly Administration further stipulates: The China Tobacco Import and Export Corporation should directly negotiate with the manufacturers of tobacco yarn and filter tips and their designated agents for imports. Except for a small amount of filter tips imported for trade and economic cooperation projects, the primary focus should be on importing tobacco yarn and processing filter tips domestically. For the import contracts of tobacco yarn and filter tips signed or executed by various tobacco import and export subsidiaries and other foreign trade companies this year, the tobacco companies of various provinces, municipalities, and autonomous regions should report the delivery situation by the end of 1988 to the State Tobacco Monopoly Administration. All unused "Import Filter Tips and Yarn Approval Forms" issued by the State Tobacco Monopoly Administration and unexecuted import permits for filter tips and yarn should be collected and returned to the State Tobacco Monopoly Administration for re-examination and approval.

　　国家烟草专卖局作出新规定
    加强对烟用丝束和烟滤嘴货源管理
    据新华社北京１月１８日电  （实习生杨广增）国家烟草专卖局决定从今年起对烟用丝束和烟滤嘴货源实行统一管理、统一平衡、统一分配。中国烟草物资公司将根据“四保四照顾”原则保名烟，照顾优质烟，适当安排其他甲级烟的生产。
    烟用丝束和烟滤嘴是国家专卖管理品。国家烟草专卖局规定，对于烟用丝束和烟滤嘴的进口，除海南省、经济特区卷烟厂自用并由指定的一个有进出口权的公司经营外，其余各省、市、自治区一律由中国烟草进出口公司及其分公司统一经营，其他任何外贸公司不得经营此项业务，对外询价、洽谈、签约和执行合同等也由中国烟草进出口公司统一负责。
    国家烟草专卖局还规定：中国烟草进出口公司应直接与烟用丝束和烟滤嘴生产厂家及其指定代理商洽谈进口。除因技贸结合项目进口少量烟用滤嘴外，主要应进口烟用丝束，国内加工烟滤嘴。对于今年委托各烟草进出口分公司和其他外贸公司签约或执行的进口烟用丝束、烟滤嘴合同，各省、市、自治区烟草公司应将至１９８８年底的到货情况报国家烟草专卖局。凡没有使用的国家烟草专卖局《进口烟滤嘴、丝束审批单》和未执行完毕的烟滤嘴、丝束进口许可证，由各省、市、自治区烟草公司负责收回送交国家烟草专卖局重新审查核定。
