The third round of the finals for the 10th New Sports Cup Go Championship was held today at the Shangri-La Hotel in the center of Singapore. Challenger and Go Saint Nie Weiping, trailing 0-2, fought back with a three and a half point victory over last year's champion Yu Bin, an 8th dan player.

In this match, Yu Bin deviated from his usual style of securing territory, starting with a "high Chinese style" layout as black and splitting Nie's white stones early on the 29th move, initiating a complex offensive. However, in the crucial mid-game and endgame phases, Yu Bin made mistakes, missing key variations and making incorrect moves, allowing Nie to easily regain the lead. The entire match lasted only 5 hours.

The fourth round of the finals, organized by the Singapore Go Association, will continue on the 13th in Singapore. This will be the decisive battle for the championship. Although Yu Bin is currently leading with a 2-1 score, if he loses another game and the score becomes tied, his situation will likely become dire.

　　新体育杯围棋赛争冠之战
    聂卫平扳回一局
    新华社新加坡１月１１日电  （通讯员程晓流）第十届新体育杯围棋赛第三局决赛今天在新加坡市中心的濠景大酒店举行。以０∶２落后的挑战者、棋圣聂卫平背水一战，以三又四分之一子的优势战胜了上届冠军俞斌八段。
    这盘棋俞斌一反以往爱捞实地的风格，执黑以“高中国流”布局起手，并于第２９手时抢先分断白棋，挑起复杂的对攻战。但在中盘扭杀和收大官子的两处紧要关头，俞斌表现失准，连续算漏变化，走出错棋，导致聂棋圣兵不血刃就夺回了一城。整个比赛仅耗时５小时。
    由新加坡围棋协会承办的本届新体育杯第四局决赛将于１３日在新加坡继续进行。这将是决定本届冠军归属的关键一战。目前俞斌虽然还以２比１的大比分暂时领先，但如果他再输一盘，被聂棋圣追成平局的话，那处境恐怕就凶多吉少了。
