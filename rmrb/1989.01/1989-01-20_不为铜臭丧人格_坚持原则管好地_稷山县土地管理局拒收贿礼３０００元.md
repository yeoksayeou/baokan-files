The Land Management Bureau of Jishan County in Shanxi Province has consciously resisted corrupt practices, refusing 44 invitations to dine and rejecting bribes totaling 3,000 yuan. By strictly controlling the approval of land use, they have won the praise of the people.

The land management department is responsible for examining and approving non-agricultural construction land, making it a relatively desirable position. While strengthening the education of land management personnel on land management concepts, the Jishan County Land Management Bureau also established three rules: anyone found to have accepted bribes or participated in banquets using their authority, anyone found to have exchanged land approvals for benefits from land acquisition units, or anyone found to have arbitrarily approved land without collective discussion, will be severely punished once discovered. At the same time, they publicly announced their operating procedures and used propaganda vehicles to go to the villages, distributing land management policies and the bureau's three disciplinary rules to the villagers, accepting supervision voluntarily.

Over the past two years, the bureau has handled and re-handled land acquisition approval procedures for 52 units in the grain, petroleum, commercial, and materials sectors without anyone taking advantage to accept bribes or purchase scarce items. Bureau Director Xu Liangying set an example. A mid-level cadre from a county-level unit tried to occupy land without proper procedures to build a house. He brought 1,000 yuan in cash to Xu Liangying's home and was promptly expelled. Ning Xingwang from the Land Inspection Section, when handling a case of excessive land occupation in Jingzhuang Village, Qinghe Town, was given 200 yuan by the party involved to overlook the issue. Ning Xingwang was furious and not only severely criticized the individual but also fined them according to regulations and reclaimed the illegally occupied land.

　　不为铜臭丧人格　坚持原则管好地
    稷山县土地管理局拒收贿礼３０００元
    本报讯  山西省稷山县土地管理局，自觉抵制歪风邪气，先后拒绝吃请４４次，拒收贿礼３０００元，严格把住土地审批关，赢得群众好评。
    土地部门主管各项非农业建设用地的审查报批工作，是个比较吃香的单位。稷山县土地管理局在加强对土地管理人员进行国土观念教育的同时，还约法三章：凡利用职权收礼受贿、参加吃请的，凡以批地换取征地单位好处的，凡该批的刁难不批、不该批的未经集体研究私自乱批的，一经发现，必须严肃处理。同时，他们还公开办事制度，利用集日、宣传车下乡到村，把土地管理政策和本局制定的三条纪律发给乡村群众，自觉接受监督。
    近两年来，该局先后为粮食、石油、商业、物资等系统的５２个单位办理和补办征地审批手续中，没有一人借机受贿或套购紧俏物品。局长徐良颖更是以身作则。县直单位有个中层干部为达到无手续要占地建房的目的。拿着１０００元现金找到他家，被徐良颖轰出家门。土地检查股的宁兴旺在处理清河镇荆庄村一家多占基地案中，当事人怕受处罚，悄悄送给他２００元，要他高抬贵手，宁兴旺见状火冒三丈，不仅对其进行了严厉批评，而且按规定罚了款，追回了多占的土地。
