Nearly 2,000 Red Army dispersed personnel in Yan'an are enjoying their later years under the care of the Party and the government.

In the past year, the civil affairs department of Yan'an region, adhering to the principles of respecting history and seeking truth from facts, has organized personnel to conduct investigations and surveys in various townships, and to register and compile records. So far, 1,919 people have been identified as "Red Army dispersed personnel." Most of them are those who, after joining the Red Army, either due to injury, illness, or defeat in war, or because they were organized to disperse and hide, became separated from their units.

Currently, the civil affairs department has issued regular and fixed living subsidies to them based on the local living standards and the length of their service.

　　延安近两千名红军失散人员安度晚年
    新华社西安１月３日电  （记者华年轮  通讯员白云奇）延安地区民政部门使近２０００名当年红军失散人员在党和政府的关怀下安度晚年。
    最近一年多来，延安地区民政部门本着尊重历史、实事求是的精神，组织力量，在各乡镇调查摸底，登记造册。目前已有１９１９人被认定了“红军失散人员”身份。他们中多数是参加红军后因伤、因病、因战争失利或组织动员分散隐蔽后脱离部队的。
    目前，民政部门已根据当地群众的生活水平和他们入伍时间的长短，发给了定期定量生活补助。
