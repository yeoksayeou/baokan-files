    据新华社武汉１月１９日电  武汉大学建筑系张在元副教授设计的建筑作品“巢居”，在日本最近举行的第１５届日新工业建筑设计竞赛中获二等奖。这是３９岁的张在元继１９８２年以来第４次在国际性建筑设计竞赛中得奖。
    一年一度的日新工业建筑设计竞赛，以其新颖而具有时代感的设计命题，吸引各国建筑师参加角逐，因而在国际建筑界有一定的影响。
    本届设计竞赛的命题是“享受城市生活乐趣的住宅”，来自世界各国的５００余名建筑师参加了这次大赛。张在元在研究了我国特大城市建设的现状及发展趋势后，提出了在发掘城市空间资源、改善城市生态环境的前提下为城市居民开拓新的居住空间的方案。他设计的“巢居”建于多层及高层住宅之间的上部空间层，以人与鸽子及鸟类共居一体的生活方式，构成一种独具特色的生态住宅。
