	New York, January 18 (Xinhua) - The price of American standard crude oil, West Texas Intermediate, for February delivery, rose by $0.31 to $19.26 per barrel at the New York Mercantile Exchange today, reaching its highest level since November 1987. This price has surpassed the $18 per barrel "target price" set by OPEC for the first half of this year.

	Today, the prices of several other crude oils for February delivery also rose at the New York Mercantile Exchange. Saudi Light crude oil increased from $14.85 to $15.10 per barrel, North Sea Brent crude oil from the UK rose from $17.15 to $17.30 per barrel, and Alaska North Slope crude oil went from $17.20 to $17.50 per barrel. The average price of these three crude oils and West Texas Intermediate is $17.29 per barrel, also approaching the $18 "target price."

	Oil industry insiders here say that the direct cause of today's rise in U.S. oil prices is the increased demand for gasoline in the market.

	The trend of increasing U.S. oil imports is also a factor in the rise in oil prices. A report released today by the American Petroleum Institute states that U.S. oil production last year fell to 8.1 million barrels per day, a decrease of nearly 3% from 1987. Oil imports averaged 7.2 million barrels per day, an increase of nearly 9% from 1987.

	The fundamental reason for the rise in oil prices is that OPEC countries have implemented their production cut agreement relatively well in the first half of this month, with daily oil production at approximately 19 million barrels, a 16% decrease from December last year. The news that a meeting of OPEC and non-OPEC oil-producing countries will be held in London on January 26 also had a positive effect on the rise in oil prices.

　　欧佩克执行限产协议　美国对原油需求转旺
　　纽约市场油价已突破１９美元
    本报纽约１月１８日电  记者刘开宸报道：纽约商品交易所今天收市时，美国标准原油——西得克萨斯中质油２月期货每桶涨价０．３１美元，达１９．２６美元，为１９８７年１１月以来最高峰。这一价格已超过了欧佩克为今年上半年制定的每桶１８美元的“目标价”。
    今天在纽约商品交易所里，其它几种原油的２月期货价格也同时上涨。沙特轻质油从每桶１４．８５美元涨到１５．１０美元，英国北海布伦特原油从每桶１７．１５美元涨到１７．３０美元，阿拉斯加（北坡）原油从每桶１７．２０美元涨到１７．５０美元。如果将这３种原油和西得克萨斯中质油一起计算，每桶平均价格为１７．２９美元，也接近１８美元的“目标价”。
    这里的石油界人士说，今天美国原油价格上涨的直接原因是市场上汽油量需求增长。
    美国进口石油增长的趋势也是油价上涨的一个原因。今天美国石油研究所发表的报告说，去年美国石油生产下降到每天８１０万桶，比１９８７年减少近３％，石油进口每天达７２０万桶，比１９８７年增加近９％。
    油价上涨的根本原因，是本月上半月欧佩克国家执行限产协议情况较好，每天产油约１９００万桶，比去年１２月产量减少１６％，将于本月２６日在伦敦召开欧佩克和非欧佩克石油生产国会议的消息，对油价上涨也起了积极作用。
