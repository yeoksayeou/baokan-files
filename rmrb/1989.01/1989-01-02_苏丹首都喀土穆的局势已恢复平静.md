The situation in Khartoum, the capital of Sudan, which had been paralyzed due to three consecutive days of mass protests and strikes, has returned to normal on December 30.

The protests and strikes were triggered by the Sudanese government's decision on December 26 to raise the prices of major food items and impose new taxes. The Sudanese government announced the cancellation of this decision late on December 29.

　　苏丹首都喀土穆的局势已恢复平静
    由于连续３天发生群众示威游行和罢工而陷于瘫痪的苏丹首都喀土穆，１２月３０日局势已经恢复平静。
    这次示威游行和罢工事件是苏丹政府１２月２６日决定提高主要食品价格和征收新税后发生的。苏丹政府已于２９日晚宣布取消了这一决定。
