The "Jidipai" research vessel, which has been obstructed by the ice shelf, has begun to leave the floating ice area after the crew members cleared a path by breaking the ice. It has ventured into the ice cracks of the Larsemann Hills ice shelf in an exploratory manner, moving slowly like a snake towards the location of the Zhongshan Station. In three days, it has only approached about 2 kilometers. As of 13:00 Beijing time on January 4, the ship is still about 8 kilometers away from the Zhongshan Station, separated by an ice field. The following is a schematic diagram of the "Jidipai" in motion.

    “极地”号在冰隙中缓缓行进
    受陆缘冰带阻挡的“极地”号考察船，经过队员凿冰开道后，已开始离开浮冰海区，探险性地驶入拉斯曼陆缘冰冰隙，蛇行般地朝中山站站址方向缓慢开动。3天仅靠近了约2公里。截至1月4日北京时间13时，这艘船距中山站站址还有约8公里宽的冰原相隔。图为“极地”号行进示意图。　张雅文绘
