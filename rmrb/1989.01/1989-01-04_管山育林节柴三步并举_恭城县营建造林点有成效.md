	Gongcheng County in Guangxi has taken a three-pronged approach to forest management, afforestation, and fuel conservation. The county has actively established forestry construction sites, stopped illegal logging, and promoted the use of coal to conserve fuel, bringing new vitality to its forestry work.

	Gongcheng County is one of the key forestry counties in northern Guangxi, with forestry land accounting for 70.27% of the county's total land area. Due to repeated illegal logging, the county's forest stock volume has decreased by 60% over 25 years, and many forests have been stripped bare. In June of last year, illegal logging resurfaced, and county leaders immediately led over 300 cadres into the forest areas, villages, and relevant enterprises and institutions to crack down on the destruction of forests. They held study sessions for thousands of illegal loggers and took measures to shut down half of the wood processing and trading units.

	Leaders at the county, township, and village levels also took the lead in establishing forest closure and afforestation sites. Since last winter alone, the county has closed off 250,000 mu of forest land and assigned over 200 full-time and part-time forest guards. To reduce the destruction of forests for fuel, the county allocated 100,000 yuan to build a coal briquette factory and 200,000 yuan to subsidize farmers in building biogas digesters.

　　管山育林节柴三步并举
    恭城县营建造林点有成效
    本报讯  记者官建文报道：广西恭城县采取管山、育林、节柴三步并举的措施，积极营建造林点，制止乱砍滥伐，普及烧煤节柴工作，使全县林业工作出现了新的生机。
    恭城县是桂北山区的重点林业县之一，林业用地占全县土地面积的７０．２７％。由于多次乱砍滥伐，２５年中全县的森林蓄积量下降了６０％，许多山林被剃成了“和尚头”。去年６月，乱砍滥伐现象又有所抬头，县领导立即带领３００多名干部，深入林区、村寨和有关企事业单位，狠刹毁林风。先后为数千名乱砍滥伐人员办了学习班，并采取措施砍掉一半木材加工、经营单位。
    县乡村三级领导还领衔办封山育林点。仅前年冬以来，全县就封山２５万亩，配备了２００多名专兼职看山人员。为了减少烧柴毁林，县里拨款１０万元兴建一家煤球厂，拨款２０万元补助农户建沼气池。
