    推动双边关系　筹备不结盟首脑会议
    新华社贝尔格莱德１月２３日电  应南斯拉夫联邦主席团的邀请，津巴布韦总统罗·穆加贝今天开始对南斯拉夫进行为期４天的正式友好访问。
    穆加贝曾多次访问过南斯拉夫，但以总统身份来访南还是首次。南斯拉夫官方人士十分重视这次访问，认为访问将推动两国关系的进一步发展，也将为筹备第９次不结盟国家首脑会议作出积极贡献。
    津巴布韦现在是不结盟运动的执行主席，而南斯拉夫是将于今年９月召开的第９次不结盟国家首脑会议的东道国。在穆加贝访南期间，两国领导人将就开好这次首脑会议、使不结盟运动适应时代要求等问题交换意见。
    据悉穆加贝将在南联邦议会演说，贝尔格莱德大学将授予他政治科学荣誉博士学位。
