In the current situation, how should public security organs break away from the closed, static public security management model and establish an open, dynamic management system to adapt to the requirements of reform and opening up and economic vitality? After more than a year of exploration and experimentation, the public security bureau of Zhangjiakou City in Hebei Province has steered the work of police stations towards a path of "public security management at the core and household registration management as the foundation," initially forming a multifunctional entity that ensures local security.

To strengthen public security management, the public security organs of Zhangjiakou City began reforming the police force structure last year. They appropriately expanded the jurisdiction of urban police stations, reduced the number of household registration police, and increased the number of public security and criminal investigation police according to local conditions. After the reform, the strength of these two types of police increased from 14% of the total police force to 48.4%. Household registration police, on the other hand, divided the population of their jurisdiction into four levels for understanding and management, focusing their efforts on key populations and the management of transient populations, avoiding the approach of tackling everything at once.

The reform practice over the past year has significantly improved the public security order in Zhangjiakou City, greatly enhancing the sense of security among the people. The average monthly number of criminal cases last year was 66% lower than in 1983, with the total number of cases dropping to less than four per ten thousand of the total population. The clearance rate for major cases was 95.8%.

After adjusting and strengthening the public security police force, the Nan Da Jie Police Station of the Public Security Bureau in the city of Xuanhua conducted area-specific management of the previously high-incidence South Street. They launched special campaigns to crack down on gambling, hooliganism, fraud, and other illegal and criminal activities, achieving stability in one area and bringing safety prevention work to the entire jurisdiction. During the comprehensive management, they discovered that Cao Manjiang, a dropout from the Fifth Middle School, had suspicions of illegal activities. With the cooperation of street public security personnel, they uncovered a theft gang of five people, solved 24 cases of various types, and recovered stolen money and goods totaling 120,000 yuan.

In strengthening urban public security cooperation, the Hongqi Lou Police Station of Zhangjiakou City made a useful attempt. They used the systematic engineering method to develop horizontal connections, combining the different characteristics of each residential committee and the prominent public security issues, to carry out special management.

To this end, they established a public security command center, forming a strict network for combating crimes. They paid great attention to the rehabilitation work of juvenile delinquents and the proper placement of released prisoners, released labor reeducation, and released juvenile offenders. Police station officers have rehabilitated 152 juvenile delinquents and have spared no effort to arrange jobs for the "three releases" personnel. They also formulated a set of methods and measures from reception, placement to education, and management.

　　以治安管理为中心　以户口管理为基础
    张家口市公安局改革派出所工作
    本报讯  新华社记者张宿堂、本报记者毛磊报道：在当前形势下，公安机关应当怎样打破封闭式的静态治安管理模式，建立开放式的动态管理体制，以适应改革开放、搞活经济的要求？河北省张家口市公安局经过一年多的探索和尝试，派出所工作走上了“以治安管理为中心，以户口管理为基础”的轨道，初步形成多功能的、保一方平安的工作实体。
    张家口市公安机关为了强化治安管理，从去年开始改革警力制，适当扩大城市派出所勤务区管辖范围，减少户籍警，因地制宜地增设治安警、刑警。改革后，两警力量由占总警力１４％提高到４８．４％。户籍警则把辖区人口分为四个层次进行了解和管理，将主要精力放在重点人口和流动人员管理上，避免“眉毛胡子”一把抓。
    一年来的改革实践，使张家口市的治安秩序明显好转，群众安全感大大增强。去年刑事案件月平均发案数比１９８３年下降了６６％，发案总数下降到全市总人口的万分之四以下。重大案件破案率为９５．８％。
    张家口市公安局宣化南大街派出所在调整充实了治安民警力量之后，对以往发案量大的南大街进行了区域性治理，开展查禁赌博、打击流氓、诈骗等违法犯罪的专项治理，做到治理一块，稳定一片，带动了整个辖区的安全防范工作。他们在综合治理中，发现第五中学退学学生曹满江有违法犯罪嫌疑，立即进行侦查。在街道治安人员配合下，挖出了盗窃团伙５人，破获各类案件２４起，追回赃款赃物共计１．２万元。
    在加强城市治安联防方面，张家口市红旗楼公安派出所作了有益尝试。他们采用系统工程的方法，发展横向联系，结合各居委会不同特点和治安方面的突出问题，分别开展专项治理。
    为此，设置了治安指挥中心，形成一个严密的打击犯罪网络。他们非常重视做好违法青少年的帮教工作和刑满释放、解除劳教、解除少年管教人员的妥善安置工作，派出所干警先后帮教１５２名违法青少年，并千方百计安排“三放”人员就业，还制定了一套从接收、安置到教育、管理的方法和措施。
