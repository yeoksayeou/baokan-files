Returning Home

Wan Zhenhuan

It is as if a lone sailboat has returned to shore after a long voyage, and a traveler who has been away from home for a long time has returned, weary from the journey!

Under the bright light, I finally saw my uncle clearly: he was tall, wearing a fur hat, leaning on a cane. Although his hair was white, his face was ruddy and bright, his spirit vigorous, his speech clear, and he appeared kind and gentle. Uncle sat down on the sofa, took off his glasses, sipped a cup of tea, and sighed to himself, "Ah, 40 years! Finally, I have returned! It feels like I've been in a dream..."

The vast sea cannot sever the bond of kinship. We tried every possible means, enduring countless hardships and twists and turns, and finally managed to get in touch with Uncle.

Uncle was eager to return home. He had originally planned to return for the Spring Festival, but because the number of people from Taiwan returning to the mainland to visit relatives had surged, he was unable to complete the entry procedures in time and had to wait until early April to be allowed to visit.

After arriving in Hong Kong, Uncle immediately called me from a long-distance phone. These days, I have been eagerly awaiting Uncle's "long-distance call" so that I can go to the train station to pick him up. Unexpectedly, Uncle took a taxi from Shenzhen back to Guangzhou!

This reunion was truly a pleasant surprise, adding a few more touches of joy.

After being apart for so long, we sat together, and our hearts were filled with both sweet and bitter emotions.

Uncle went to Taiwan in 1948, and four years later, he retired from the military, farmed, fished at sea, and later opened a photography studio to make a living. Although life was happy, he always missed his hometown and his wife and children in Hunan... "How is Auntie doing now? Has she remarried?"

"Auntie is doing well. She has been waiting for you!" I said.

"Oh. I haven't seen her in 40 years!" Uncle said softly, his eyes showing a hint of sadness.

It was late at night. I heard Uncle tossing and turning in bed, unable to fall asleep. Was he reminiscing about the long, tumultuous years, or was he excited and sleepless because of the beautiful dream of a family reunion that was about to come true...

Four days later, Uncle hurried to Xiangluo, Hunan. As soon as he arrived home, Auntie threw herself into Uncle's arms, sobbing uncontrollably. Uncle held Auntie's hands and said, "You've suffered! You've suffered! It's amazing that you raised three children!" Auntie cried, "I never thought I would see you again in this life..." Uncle's eyes welled up with tears, and he slowly took out a brand-new gold watch from his pocket and personally put it on Auntie's thin hand.

Uncle was also very frank, saying, "Before returning to the mainland, I heard that the living conditions of mainland compatriots were very difficult, but 'seeing is believing,' it's not like that at all!... Of course, your lives are not yet very affluent, but I believe that in a few years, things will get better and better..."

How many tragedies like this have occurred between the two sides of the strait? Examples of husbands and wives being separated, longing for each other, and even dying without ever seeing each other again are countless! Uncle and Auntie, this couple who have gone through hardships together, are truly the lucky ones in their misfortune!

In addition to going to Hunan, Uncle also returned to his hometown of Xingning. I asked with a smile, "Uncle, what is your overall impression of this trip?" "Good, good, much better than I imagined." Uncle nodded.

"What was your original impression?" I wanted to "get to the bottom of it."

Time flies, and unknowingly, a month is about to pass. Uncle is going back to Taiwan, and we specially prepared a sumptuous banquet to see him off. Uncle was very happy and said, "Next year, I will definitely come back for the Spring Festival, you wait and see! In the future, as long as I can still walk, I will come back every year..."

At the moment of parting, Uncle took out a large stack of Renminbi and handed it to me, saying, "Thank you for your warm hospitality..." "No, no!" I quickly declined, "Uncle! It is completely appropriate to receive you..."

My wife also intervened, saying, "Uncle, no matter what, you must take the money back, otherwise, you are treating us like outsiders!"

Seeing that our attitude was firm and sincere, Uncle was deeply moved and said meaningfully, "Only you and your family have shown me true familial affection..."

Uncle left, reluctantly. He left with satisfaction, with regret, and with the earnest instructions of his relatives. Will Uncle come back? I think he will, definitely, because his heart is left here, left in the hometown that gave birth to him...

　　归来
    万振环
    犹如远航的孤帆泊了岸，久别故乡的游子风尘仆仆归来了！
    在明亮的灯光下，我终于看清了大伯的尊容：他身躯高大，头戴一顶绒帽，手拄一根拐杖，虽然白发苍苍，脸色却红润发亮，精神健旺，谈吐清晰，显得慈祥和蔼。大伯在沙发上坐下，摘下眼镜，呷了一口红茶，自言自语地感叹道：“唉，４０年了！总算回来了！真好像是做了一场梦啊！……”
    茫茫大海隔不断骨肉亲情。我们想尽千方百计，历尽艰难波折，终于跟大伯联系上了。
    大伯归心似箭。他原定回乡过春节的，因为台湾回大陆探亲的人数激增，一时无法办妥入境手续，一直延至４月初才获准探亲。
    大伯抵达香港后，立即给我挂了个长途电话。这几天我天天都在盼大伯的“长途”，以便到火车站去接他。想不到大伯自己搭“的士”从深圳回到了羊城！
    这种相见真是喜出望外，更增添了几分欢乐的情趣。
    亲人久别，千言万语不知从何说起。我们坐在一起，彼此的心里只涌动着既甜蜜又酸楚的感情波澜。
    大伯是１９４８年到台湾的，四年后退伍，种过田，出海打过鱼，后来开了个照相馆谋生。日子虽然过得快乐，只是心里老惦记着老家，惦记着湖南的妻子、儿女……“你伯母现在情况怎样？有没有改嫁？”
    “伯母身体还好，她一直等着您呢！”我说。
    “哦。我足足４０年没见到她了！”大伯轻声说，眼里露出几分伤感。
    夜深了。我听见大伯躺在床上辗转反侧，久久不能入睡。他是在缅怀漫长的沧桑岁月呢，还是为那个即将来临的亲人团聚的美梦而激动难眠……
    四天之后，大伯便风尘仆仆赶到湖南汨罗，一到家，伯母便扑在伯父身上泣不成声。伯父拉着伯母的双手连声说：“你受苦了！你受苦了！真难为你把三个孩子带大啊！”伯母流着泪说：“想不到这辈子还能见到你！……”伯父的眼圈儿潮湿了，他缓缓地从衣袋里摸出一只崭新的金表，亲自戴在伯母枯瘦的手上。
    大伯也很坦率，说：“没回大陆前，我听说大陆同胞生活很苦，嘿嘿，‘百闻不如一见’，其实并不是那么回事！……当然，你们现在的生活还不太富裕，相信过几年会越来越好……”
    海峡两岸这种悲剧，难道只是大伯和伯母才有的么？类似这种夫妻分离、望穿秋水甚至终生不得再见含恨而逝的事例，简直多得很！大伯与伯母这对患难夫妻，真是不幸中之万幸了！
    大伯除了去湖南，还回了一趟兴宁老家。我含笑地问：“大伯，这次旅行总的印象怎样？”“好，好，比原来想象的要好得多。”大伯点点头。
    “原来的想象是怎么样的？”我有点“打破砂锅问到底”。
    时光似流水，不知不觉一个月即将过去。大伯要回台湾去了，我们特意办了一桌丰盛的酒席为大伯饯行。大伯十分高兴地说：“明年我一定要回来过春节，你们等着好了！以后，只要我还能走动，每年肯定要回来一次……”
    临别，大伯掏出一大叠人民币递给我，说：“多谢你们热情款待……”
    “不，不！”我连忙谢绝，“大伯！接待您老人家是完全应该的……”
    妻子也在一旁阻拦说：“大伯，您无论如何要把钱收回去，不然的话，就是把我们当外人看了！”
    大伯见我们态度坚决，确实真心实意，不由得心情十分激动，意味深长地说：“你们一家对我才是真正的骨肉感情呵！……”
    大伯走了，依依不舍地。带着满足，带着遗憾，也带着亲人的谆谆嘱托。大伯还会回来吗？我想会的，一定会的，因为他的心留下来了，留在生他养他的故乡……
