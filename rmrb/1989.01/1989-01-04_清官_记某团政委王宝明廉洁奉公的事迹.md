In September 1984, Wang Baoming was transferred to a certain regiment as the political commissar. On his first day, at a meeting of all officers above the rank of platoon leader, he pledged, "To serve in office with clean hands and benefit the entire regiment." Over the years, he has kept his promise with exemplary actions, earning the trust of the soldiers and officers.

	Maintaining the Right Direction - Not Taking a Single Cent from Income that Violates Policies

In 1986, a retired officer wrote to the regiment. He said that their unit had a small air-conditioned van, and if the regiment bought it, they could make a profit of 200,000 to 300,000 yuan by reselling it. Wang Baoming knew that engaging in such business was against the policy. He persuaded everyone to abandon the idea. In 1987, a young officer in the regiment approached Political Commissar Wang, saying that if he were allowed to retire, he could use his sister-in-law's connections in Northeast China to procure 100 cubic meters of timber at a low price, making a "big profit." Wang Baoming sternly criticized the young officer, saying, "Retirement matters must follow organizational arrangements and cannot be achieved through commodity exchange. Moreover, engaging in such transactions is against the regulations. We cannot do it!" In early 1988, the higher authorities proposed developing production and operations to improve the material and cultural life of the troops. Wang Baoming pointed out to the entire regiment: In production and operations, we must not violate national policies and laws, and we must not engage in improper practices. During the process of negotiating the lease of a certain village's coal mine, there were three units competing. Some units held grand banquets for "negotiations." At this time, some comrades suggested giving the village leaders some goodwill money. Wang Baoming said, "Government agencies are not allowed to engage in bribery, and the central authorities have repeatedly emphasized this. We must not violate this." Whether we can win the competition depends on whether we can gain the trust of the other party. He personally met with the village leaders to discuss the regiment's operational capabilities, plans, and financial situation, gaining their trust and finally sealing the deal.

	Self-Discipline and Public Service - Not Taking a Single Cent of Public Advantages

"Leaders must lead by example in self-discipline and public service to have persuasive power and influence," is a phrase Wang Baoming often says. According to the regiment's regulations, all direct relatives of officers who pass away are entitled to 80 yuan in compensation. In 1987, Wang Baoming's mother passed away, and the regiment decided to give him 150 yuan in compensation. He said, "I accept the organization's care, but I do not want the compensation." After the regiment moved, the staff at the remaining post sent a carload of coal to Wang Baoming's family. He found out and promptly paid for the coal at the market price. The staff at the remaining post said, "This is a coal-rich area; sending some coal is nothing." He said, "Following party rules and laws, I, as the political commissar, should lead by example." Over the years, whenever Wang Baoming had visitors from his hometown or old comrades-in-arms, he always paid for the meals himself. He also insisted on visiting various departments and companies in the regiment every six months to seek opinions, asking everyone to help him "clean up."

	Upholding Principles - Not Handling a Single Matter that Compromises Party Principles

In 1986, during the transfer of volunteers, a platoon leader from the Intelligence Company, who had no one to depend on at home, wanted to transfer as a volunteer and sent Wang Baoming two suitcases worth over 200 yuan, hoping he would say a word. Wang Baoming sympathized with the platoon leader, but the platoon leader had no special skills, and transferring as a volunteer would not be beneficial to the construction of the unit. Therefore, he had several heart-to-heart talks with the platoon leader, explaining the conditions and policy regulations for transferring as a volunteer, pointing out that the practice of giving gifts was wrong, and returned the suitcases. Afterwards, he bought a set of self-study books on animal husbandry and sent them to the platoon leader. In the days leading up to the transfer of volunteers in 1987, a soldier from the Artillery Battalion sent 1,000 yuan to Political Commissar Wang, hoping he would help. Wang Baoming immediately informed the Artillery Battalion leadership to have a heart-to-heart talk with the soldier and returned the money in full. Then, Wang Baoming reiterated the regulations regarding the transfer of volunteers.

Wang Baoming treats old leaders, old comrades-in-arms, or relatives and friends impartially, not being swayed by relationships, not being tempted by money, and not making exceptions for personal favors. He insists on not attending banquets and not accepting gifts.

　　“清官”
    ——记某团政委王宝明廉洁奉公的事迹
    周友兴　王立硕
    １９８４年９月，王宝明调某团任政委，第一天在全团排以上干部大会上立下了“为官一场，两袖清风，造福全团”的军令状。几年来，他以模范行动实现了诺言，赢得了官兵的信赖。
  　把好方向　违反政策的收入一分不捞
    １９８６年，一位转业干部给团里来信。说他们单位有台带空调的小型客车，如果团里买上，倒手便可以赚２到３万元。王宝明知道做这种生意是政策不允许的。他说服大家，打消了念头。１９８７年，本团一位年轻干部找到王政委，说如果让他转业，他可以通过他姐夫在东北的关系，以低价给团里调１００立方米木材，能赚个“大数”。王宝明严肃地批评这位年轻干部说：“转业问题，要服从组织，不能用商品交换的方法来达到目的。再说，做这种买卖是违反规定的。我们不能干！”１９８８年初，上级提出要发展生产经营，改善部队的物质文化生活。王宝明向全团指出：在生产经营中不能违反国家的政策和法令，不能搞不正之风。在联系租赁某乡煤矿过程中，同时有３个单位竞争。有的单位大摆宴席进行“磋商”。这时，有的同志提出给乡领导送点好处费。王宝明说，党政机关不准行贿受贿，中央已三令五申，我们决不能违反。在竞争中能否取胜，关键是能不能取得对方的信任。他亲自找乡领导谈本团的经营能力、计划和资金等情况，取得了对方的信任，终于成交。
  　克己奉公　公家的便宜一点不占
    “领导干部带头克己奉公才有说服力、号召力”，这是王宝明经常说的一句话。按团里规定，凡干部的直系亲属病故，均可享受８０元的补助。１９８７年王宝明的母亲病故，团里决定给他补助１５０元。他说：“组织的关心我领了，但是补助我不要。”部队移防后，留守处的同志给王宝明家里拉了一车烤火煤。他回去知道后，及时到留守处按价付了款。留守处的同志说：“这里是煤海，拉点煤算什么？”他说：“遵守党规党法，我这个当政委的应当带头。”几年来，王宝明每逢家乡来人、老战友探望，他都做到请客自己掏钱。他还坚持每半年到机关各部门和营连征求意见，请大家帮助自己“洗脸”。
  　秉公用权　丧失党性原则的事一件不办
    １９８６年转志愿兵时，特务连有位班长因家中无依无靠，想转志愿兵，给王宝明送去价值２００多元的两个皮箱，希望他说句话。王宝明同情这位班长，但是这位班长没有专长，转成志愿兵对部队建设起不了作用。于是，他几次找班长谈心，讲明转志愿兵的条件和政策规定，指出送礼这种做法是错误的，把皮箱退回。事后，自己花钱买了一套养殖技术自学丛书送给那位班长。１９８７年转志愿兵前夕，炮营有个战士将１０００元钱送给王政委，想请政委帮帮忙。王宝明马上告诉炮营领导，让他们找这个战士谈心，并且将钱如数退还。然后，王宝明重申了转志愿兵有关规定。
    王宝明对待老首长、老战友或亲戚朋友，都不被关系左右，不为钱财动心，不因人情破例，坚持做到请吃不去、送礼不要。
