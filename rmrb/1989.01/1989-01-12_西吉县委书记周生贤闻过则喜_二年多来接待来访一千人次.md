A letter criticizing the county leadership directly caught the attention of Zhou Shengxian, the Party Secretary of West Ji County in Ningxia Hui Autonomous Region. He wrote on this letter, which was harsh in tone, "Welcome criticism, accept criticism, and improve work."

The letter from the masses reflected the slow progress of the county's sewer construction project. Although the letter contained some harsh words directed at the county leadership, Zhou Shengxian understood the good intentions behind it: the letter not only analyzed the reasons for the slow progress of the project but also provided suggestions for speeding up the work.

"Such letters from the masses should be taken seriously," Zhou Shengxian immediately instructed the relevant departments to handle the matter. When the letter left Zhou Shengxian's office, the sender's name had already been cut off by Zhou. Someone asked why, and he replied, "The opinions in the letter are to the point, and the suggestions are feasible. There is no need to cause unnecessary trouble for this person who cares about urban construction."

This county Party Secretary took office in September 1986. Over the past two years, he has received over 1,000 visits from the masses and handled over 2,000 letters with the same enthusiasm and seriousness.

One day last summer, a young man came to the county Party committee to see Zhou Shengxian, describing the poverty in his village and hoping that the county could provide a loan to help them utilize the local forest and grass resources to develop rabbit farming. Zhou Shengxian supported the plan for the masses to get rich and immediately arranged for a loan and rabbit breeds. Later, Zhou Shengxian and the county government leaders held a rabbit farming on-site meeting in the village, promoting their experience. Now, rabbit farming has become one of the three major industries in West Ji County's commodity economy.

The difficulties with the school buildings at Sanhe Middle School were also resolved due to a letter from the masses. One day, after returning from a meeting in the autonomous region, Zhou Shengxian saw a letter reporting that the beams and rafters of Sanhe Middle School had broken, and the roof had collapsed. He immediately instructed the office to verify the situation and invited relevant department heads to discuss solutions. The next day, Zhou Shengxian and County Magistrate Lu Yancheng went to Sanhe Middle School and decided on three measures on the spot.

Under Zhou Shengxian's leadership, the West Ji County Party Committee and County Government established a system of receiving mass visits every week, and seriously handling mass letters has become a common practice. One day, County Magistrate Lu Yancheng learned from a mass letter that Pingfeng Health Center and the Supply and Marketing Cooperative had a dispute over land ownership, which, despite mediation, remained unresolved, causing economic losses of over ten thousand yuan. The next day, he convened relevant department heads to investigate on the spot, finally prompting both parties to reach an agreement. This long-standing "difficult problem" that had dragged on for three years was resolved in half a day.

### 西吉县委书记周生贤闻过则喜  二年多来接待来访一千人次

　　西吉县委书记周生贤闻过则喜
    二年多来接待来访一千人次
    本报讯  新华社记者张锦、邹爱国报道：一封直言批评县领导的来信，引起了宁夏回族自治区西吉县委书记周生贤的重视。他在这封言词刻薄的来信上写道：“闻过则喜，要接受批评，改进工作”。
    这封群众来信反映的是县城下水道工程进展缓慢的问题。来信虽然骂了县领导几句难听话，但周生贤却理解到来信人用心之良苦：信里既分析了工程缓慢的原因，又提出了加快工程进度的建议。
    “这样的群众来信，我们应该重视。”周生贤当即要求有关方面阅处。当这封信离开周生贤办公室时，寄信者的姓名已被周生贤剪去。有人对此不解，他说：“来信意见中肯，建议可行，没有必要给这位关心市政建设的热心人添不必要的麻烦。”
    这位县委书记是１９８６年９月就任的。两年多来，他就是以这份热心和认真精神，接待群众来访１０００多人次，处理群众来信２０００多件。
    去年初夏的一天，一个青年人来县委找到周生贤，诉说村里如何贫困，希望县上贷点款，帮助他们利用当地的林草优势，发展家兔生产。群众脱贫致富的计划得到周生贤的支持，他立即去联系贷款和种兔。后来，周生贤和县政府的领导又在这个村召开养兔现场会，推广了他们的经验。现在，养兔业已成为西吉县发展商品经济的三大行业之一。
    三合中学的校舍困难，也是由于一封群众来信促进了问题的解决。一天，刚从自治区开会回到县里的周生贤，看到一封反映三合中学校舍出现椽檀断裂，屋顶塌陷的来信，立即让办公室核实情况，并请有关部门负责人来研究解决办法。第二天，周生贤和县长卢延程来到三合中学，当场拍板定了三条措施。
    在周生贤的带动下，西吉县委、县政府建立了每周接待群众来访的制度，认真处理群众来信已蔚然成风。县长卢延程一天从群众来信中得知，平峰卫生院与供销社就地皮所有权的问题发生争执，虽经调解尚未解决，造成经济损失上万元。第二天，他召集有关方面负责人到现场调查，终于促使双方达成了协议。这个拖了三年的“老大难”问题，只用半天便解决了。
