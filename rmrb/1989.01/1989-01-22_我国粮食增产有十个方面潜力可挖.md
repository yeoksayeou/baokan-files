    Officials from the Ministry of Agriculture recently pointed out that China has ten areas of potential for increasing grain production.

    First, China has 200 million mu of arable land yet to be cultivated. If half of this land is cultivated and 80% of it is used to grow wheat with a yield of 150 kilograms per mu, then 120 billion kilograms of grain can be produced annually.

    Second, two-thirds of China's fields are medium- and low-yielding. If medium-yielding fields are transformed into high-yielding fields and low-yielding fields into medium-yielding fields, with an increase of 50-100 kilograms per mu, then nearly 100 million mu of medium- and low-yielding fields can produce an additional 500-1000 billion kilograms of grain.

    Third, the current national grain planting index is 150%. If this index is increased by 10%, it will add 150 million mu of planting area, increasing grain production by 100 billion kilograms.

    Fourth, China uses 50 billion kilograms of grain for seeds annually. If seeds are selected and sown after refinement, this can be reduced by 20%, saving 10 billion kilograms of grain annually.

    Fifth, nationwide grain losses due to diseases and pests amount to 150-200 billion kilograms annually. If new prevention and treatment technologies are promoted, these losses can be reduced.

    Sixth, China's annual grain wastage rate is 30%. If this is reduced to 10%, 100 billion kilograms of grain can be saved annually.

    Seventh, promoting hybrid rice and conventional corn varieties can increase grain production by 30 billion kilograms annually.

    Eighth, using plastic film covering for corn cultivation can increase yield by 100 kilograms per mu. If half of the area adopts this technology, more than 100 billion kilograms of grain can be produced additionally.

    Ninth, formula fertilization technology can increase fertilizer efficiency by 20%. If 30 billion kilograms of chemical fertilizer are applied annually, grain production can be increased by several dozen billion kilograms.

    Tenth, China's farmlands are affected by disasters annually, covering more than 100 million mu. If the affected area is reduced, grain losses can be decreased by 100 billion kilograms annually.

　　我国粮食增产有十个方面潜力可挖
    国家农业部有关人士最近指出，我国粮食增产有十个方面的潜力可挖。
    一、我国有待开垦的宜耕地２亿亩如辟出一半，按８０％的面积种小麦，亩产１５０公斤计算，则每年可增产１２０亿公斤。
    二、我国尚有２／３的中、低产田，如果使中产田变为高产田，低产田变为中产田，按每亩增产５０—１００公斤计算，则近１０亿亩中低产田可增产粮食５００—１０００亿公斤。
    三、目前全国粮食复种指数为１５０％，如果复种指数提高１０％，可增加播种面积１．５亿亩，增产粮食１００亿公斤。
    四、我国每年谷物用种量５０亿公斤，如果精选后播种，可减少２０％，每年可节省种粮１０亿公斤。
    五、全国每年因病害损失粮食１５０—２００亿公斤，如果推广防治新技术，可降低损失。
    六、我国每年粮食损耗率达３０％，如果降至１０％，每年可减少粮食损失１００亿公斤。
    七、推广杂交水稻、玉米常规品种，按每亩增产粮食计算，共有３０亿公斤。
    八、地膜覆盖栽培玉米，亩增产１００公斤，如果有一半面积采用此项技术，可增产１００多亿公斤。
    九、配方施肥技术可提高肥效２０％，若每年增施３０亿公斤化肥，可增产粮食几十亿公斤。
    十、我国农田每年受灾面积约１亿亩以上，如果减少受灾面积，每年又可减少粮食损失１００亿公斤。
