The Communist Party of China's disciplinary inspection commission in Hubei Province recently issued a notice, deciding to expel from the Party the former county committee secretary of Yuan'an County, Hubei Province, Zeng Xianxi, who had maliciously defamed others. The notice also requires all levels of Party organizations in the province to strengthen education on Party principles, discipline, and legal awareness among Party members.

The notice issued by the Hubei Provincial Disciplinary Inspection Commission on January 23 stated that Zeng Xianxi, who is 44 years old this year, was promoted to the position of county committee secretary of Yuan'an County in November 1983. In December 1986, the Yichang Municipal Committee decided to recommend the county committee member and county mayor, Wang Bingnan, to attend the provincial Party style construction experience exchange meeting. At this time, the regional disciplinary inspection commission received a letter from the provincial disciplinary inspection commission, signed by "several masses," reflecting that Wang Bingnan had issues during the "Cultural Revolution." In May 1987, the county disciplinary inspection commission received a letter, personally forwarded by Zeng Xianxi, signed by "several cadres and masses," reflecting that Wang Bingnan had seven issues, including bribery and accepting bribes. A few days later, two slogans reading "Overthrow Mayor Wang Bingnan" appeared in the propaganda display case of the county cinema and in front of the gate of the county's first middle school. In June 1987, shortly after Wang Bingnan was promoted to deputy director of the Yichang Administrative Bureau, both the Yichang Regional Disciplinary Inspection Commission and Wang Bingnan himself received anonymous letters containing slanderous and threatening content such as "Wang Bingnan, we want to overthrow you."

An official from the Hubei Provincial Disciplinary Inspection Commission's case review department told reporters that after repeated investigations by the provincial and regional disciplinary inspection commissions, it was found that the issues reflected in the anonymous letters were purely distortions of facts, fabricated out of thin air, and were intentional slander and defamation. After the public security authorities repeatedly conducted scientific and technological examinations on the handwriting, it was confirmed that the several anonymous letters and two slogans were all written by Zeng Xianxi. One of the anonymous letters was drafted by Zeng Xianxi and given to a staff member of the county committee office to copy.

The notice pointed out that the reason for Zeng Xianxi's mistake was that his individualism had grown to a malignant extent, and he was blinded by officialdom and jealous of talented individuals. After his mistakes were exposed, he refused to accept the organization's education and rescue, wrote another anonymous letter to defend his mistakes, continued to defame Wang Bingnan and others, and actively sought to make the case go away.

The notice pointed out that every young and middle-aged cadre should correctly handle promotions and appointments, consciously strengthen their awareness of Party discipline and legal awareness, and resolutely oppose jealousy of talented individuals. All levels of Party organizations should strengthen the management and supervision of Party members and cadres.

The decision by the provincial disciplinary inspection commission to expel Zeng Xianxi from the Party has been approved by the Hubei Provincial Committee.

　　歪曲事实蓄意诬陷诽谤同事    
    原远安县委书记曾宪喜被清除出党
    新华社武汉１月２７日电（记者方政军、通讯员刘恒森）中共湖北省纪律检查委员会近日发出通报，决定开除诬陷他人的湖北省远安县原县委书记曾宪喜的党籍，并要求全省各级党组织加强对共产党员进行党性、党纪和法制教育。
    湖北省纪检委１月２３日发出的通报说，曾宪喜今年４４岁，１９８３年１１月被提拔为远安县委书记。１９８６年１２月，宜昌地委确定推荐远安县县委常委、县长王炳南出席全省党风建设经验交流会。这时，地区纪委收到省纪委转来署名“几个群众”的来信，反映王炳南在“文革”中有问题。１９８７年５月，县纪委接到曾宪喜亲自批转的一封署名“几名干部群众”来信，反映王炳南有行贿受贿等７个问题，没过几天，在县电影院宣传橱窗和县一中门前电线杆上，又出现了两条“打倒王炳南县长”的标语。１９８７年６月，王炳南被提拔为宜昌行署副专员不久，宜昌地区纪委和王炳南本人分别收到写有“王炳南，我们要打倒你”等诬蔑、恐吓内容的匿名信件。
    湖北省纪委审理处负责同志告诉记者，经省、地纪委反复调查，匿名信反映的问题纯属歪曲事实，无中生有，蓄意诬陷诽谤。经公安机关对笔迹反复进行科学技术鉴定，确认几次匿名信和两条标语均系曾宪喜一人所写，其中一封匿名信是曾宪喜提供底稿请县委办公室一位工作人员抄写的。
    通报指出，曾宪喜犯错误的原因是他个人主义恶性膨胀，官迷心窍、嫉贤妒能。错误暴露后，他拒不接受组织的教育和挽救，再次书写匿名信为自己的错误辩解，继续诬陷王炳南以及其他人，还到处活动企图使案件不了了之。
    通报指出，每个中青年干部都要正确对待提拔使用，要自觉增强党纪、法制观念，要坚决反对嫉贤妒能；各级党组织要切实加强对党员干部的管理和监督。
    省纪委开除曾宪喜党籍的决定，已得到湖北省委的批准。
