A good start to improving Indo-Pakistani relations

By Ren Yujun, Correspondent of the People's Daily

The most notable news during the fourth summit of the South Asian Association for Regional Cooperation held in Islamabad at the end of 1988 was the first meeting between Pakistani Prime Minister Benazir Bhutto and Indian Prime Minister Rajiv Gandhi. They assessed the situation and took a gratifying step towards improving Indo-Pakistani relations. On the afternoon of December 31, the two countries signed three agreements: "Non-Attack on Each Other's Nuclear Facilities," "Avoiding Double Taxation on Bilateral Trade," and "Strengthening Cultural Exchanges." Observers here believe that these are New Year's gifts from the two leaders to the peoples of the two countries and the South Asian region.

India and Pakistan are the two most important countries in the South Asian subcontinent, with close historical and geographical ties. Their combined population accounts for one-fifth of the world's total. However, since independence, the two countries have had frequent conflicts over territory, ethnicity, and religion, which have undoubtedly hindered the social stability and economic development of these two countries.

After the new elected government of Pakistan came to power, the leaders of the two countries expressed their goodwill to improve bilateral relations. Indian Prime Minister Rajiv Gandhi sent a warm congratulatory telegram to Benazir Bhutto upon her assumption of the premiership. To create a good atmosphere for the summit between the two countries' leaders, India canceled its annual winter military exercises on the Indo-Pakistani border. Benazir Bhutto also expressed her hope to improve relations between the two countries and actively invited Rajiv Gandhi to extend his visit after the South Asian summit to facilitate bilateral talks. During the conference, the leaders of the two countries, in addition to participating in the scheduled multilateral meetings, held a round of bilateral talks each day. The three agreements signed are the positive results of these talks. At the joint press conference held after the signing, both prime ministers expressed their determination to work for the improvement of Indo-Pakistani relations. Rajiv Gandhi told Benazir Bhutto, "Since the signing of the Shimla Agreement by your father and my mother, this is the first time that India and Pakistan have signed an agreement." "I hope my visit will help to normalize Indo-Pakistani relations." Benazir Bhutto also said, "Our talks are very important. We have taken a historic step towards improving Pakistan-India relations."

The two leaders frankly admitted that there are still issues such as the Kashmir problem, the Siachen Glacier problem, ethnic and religious conflicts, and the arms race between the two countries. Rajiv Gandhi said that the relevant ministers of the two countries have already started dialogues on these issues, and the two governments support these positive contacts. The countries of South Asia are equal, and the exchanges and cooperation among the peoples of South Asia will help to improve relations among the countries. Benazir Bhutto also said, "We have not underestimated the difficulties ahead, but we will start by solving the less controversial issues and gradually resolve the historical entanglements between the two countries." "I believe that the process of peace has begun."

India and Pakistan play a crucial role in solving the problems of South Asia. Peaceful cooperation between the two countries will bring stability and prosperity to the South Asian region; conflicts between the two countries will harm the region. The first generation of leaders of the two countries once joined hands to fight for national independence and national liberation. Today, people hope that the new generation of leaders, elected by the people, will be able to solve the problems that the previous generation could not solve, truly normalize relations between the two countries, and benefit the peoples of the two countries and the entire South Asian subcontinent.

　　改善印巴关系的良好开端
    本报记者  任毓骏
    １９８８年底在伊斯兰堡举行的南亚区域合作联盟第四届首脑会议期间最令人瞩目的新闻是巴基斯坦总理贝·布托和印度总理拉·甘地的首次会晤。他们审时度势，为改善印巴关系迈出了可喜的一步。１２月３１日下午，印巴两国签订了《互不攻击对方核设施》、《避免两国贸易双倍征税》和《两国加强文化交流》等３个协定。此间观察家认为，这是两国领导人献给两国人民乃至南亚地区人民的新年礼物。
    印度和巴基斯坦是南亚次大陆的两个最重要的国家，两国有密切的历史和地缘联系，两国人口之和占世界总人口的１／５。但自独立以来，两国在领土、种族和宗教等方面的矛盾时有发生，这无疑牵制了这两个国家的社会安定和经济发展。
    巴基斯坦新的民选政府产生之后，印巴两国领导人都表示了改善双边关系的良好愿望。印度总理拉·甘地在贝·布托就任总理时发来了热情的贺电；为给两国政府首脑会晤创造了良好的气氛，印度取消了一年一度的在印巴边界举行的冬季军事演习。贝·布托也多次表示希望改善两国关系，并主动邀请拉·甘地在南亚首脑会晤后延长访问时间，以便进行双边会谈。会议期间，印巴领导人除参加议程中的多边会晤外，每天都举行一轮双边会谈，签订的３个协定就是这些会谈的积极成果。两位总理在签约后举行的联合记者招待会上都表示要为改善印巴关系尽自己的努力。拉·甘地对贝·布托说：“自从你父亲和我母亲签订西姆拉协议之后，这次是印巴之间第一次签约”，“我希望我的来访有助于实现印巴关系正常化。”贝·布托也说：“我们举行的会谈非常重要，我们已为改善巴印关系迈出了具有历史意义的步子。”
    印巴两位领导人坦率地承认，两国之间还存在诸如克什米尔问题、星峡冰川问题、种族和宗教冲突以及军备竞赛等问题。拉·甘地表示，印巴两国的有关部长已经就这些问题开展对话，两国政府支持这些积极的接触。南亚各国是平等的，南亚各国人民的交往和合作将有助于改善各国之间的关系。贝·布托也说，我们双方都没有低估面前的困难，但我们将从解决争议较小的问题开始，逐步解决两国之间的历史纠葛。“我认为和平的进程已由此开始。”
    印度和巴基斯坦在解决南亚问题上都有举足轻重的作用。两国和平合作，则南亚地区安定繁荣；两国发生冲突，则南亚地区随之受损。这两个国家的第一代领导人曾携手为国家的独立和民族的解放而奋斗。今天，人们寄希望于两位由民选产生的新一代领导人，但愿他们能解决上一代人们不能解决的问题，真正实现两国关系的正常化，为两国人民乃至整个南亚次大陆的人民造福。
