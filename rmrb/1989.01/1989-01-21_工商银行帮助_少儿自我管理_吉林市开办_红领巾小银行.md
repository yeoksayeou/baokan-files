The Bank of Commerce has assisted in establishing "Little Red Scarf Banks" in over 150 primary and secondary schools in Jilin City, Jilin Province. These "banks" managed by children aim to cultivate thrift among students.

Currently, these "banks" have 46,213 student depositors, with a total savings amount of over 200,000 yuan, averaging 4.46 yuan per student.

The first children's "bank" in the city was established by 14 primary schools in Changyi District. In March 1987, these schools launched an initiative among students to save one fen (0.01 yuan), one piece of paper, one pen, one drop of water, one grain of rice, one unit of electricity, and one piece of coal, aiming to accumulate small amounts to support the Four Modernizations. Based on this activity, with the assistance of the Bank of Commerce, these schools jointly established the Little Red Scarf Savings Office. The 25 staff members were all Young Pioneers, and savings operations were conducted according to banking regulations. This year, the Little Red Scarf Savings Office was renamed the "Little Red Scarf Bank." By early January of this year, this earliest-established "bank" had 792 depositors, with a savings amount of 18,000 yuan, averaging 22.50 yuan per student.

This meaningful activity has been commended by the provincial and municipal education departments and the Bank of Commerce. Subsequently, various primary and secondary schools in Jilin City have followed suit in establishing these "banks."

　　工商银行帮助　少儿自我管理    
    吉林市开办“红领巾小银行”
    新华社长春１月２０日电（记者赵玉庆）吉林省吉林市１５０多所中小学开办了“红领巾小银行”。这种由少年儿童自己管理的“小银行”，旨在帮助同学们养成勤俭节约的好习惯。
    这些“小银行”目前已有４６２１３个学生储户，储蓄金额达２０多万元，平均每个学生存款４．４６元。
    全市第一家少儿“小银行”是由昌邑区１４所小学开办的。１９８７年３月，这些学校在学生中开展了节约一分钱、一张纸、一支笔、一滴水、一粒米、一度电、一块煤，积少成多，积砂成塔，支援四化的活动。在这一活动的基础上，由市工商银行出面帮助，这些学校联合创办了红领巾储蓄所，２５名工作人员全部由少先队员担任，储蓄业务按银行章程办理。今年红领巾储蓄所更名“红领巾小银行”。截至今年１月上旬，这所最早创办的“小银行”已有７９２个储户，存款额达１．８万元，平均每个学生存款２２．５０元。
    这一有意义的活动受到了省、市教育部门和工商银行的表彰。之后，吉林市各中小学校相继开办了这种“小银行”。
