The first leg of our journey to report on Black Africa—Kenya—has made us feel the depth of Sino-Kenyan friendship at every moment.

The Main Melody of Friendship

Upon arriving in Nairobi, without even resting, a staff member from the Kenya African National Union (KANU) Central Committee, Mr. Peter, quickly came to our residence to express a warm welcome to the People's Daily reporter group for coming to conduct interviews. He also invited us to visit the Nakuru region, about 200 kilometers away, the very next morning. Accompanied by the KANU Nakuru Regional Chairman and several local officials, we arrived at Lake Nakuru on the last day of December 1988. The vast expanse of blue water was filled with countless beautiful flamingos, flying and resting, like cotton fluff or feathered clouds, a spectacular sight. After lunch, the regional chairman suddenly smiled and told us, "Every New Year's Eve, President Moi comes here to attend a public gathering and deliver a New Year's address. On this occasion, the President is willing to meet with you this afternoon..." This news made us very happy. It turned out that we were invited to Nakuru without even having a chance to see the beautiful capital of Nairobi, all for such an exceptional courtesy. We were arranged to sit on the stage about two meters away from the President. After the grand cultural performance ended, the President delivered a speech. When talking about Kenya's friends around the world, he repeatedly mentioned the friendly relations with China and introduced us to the attendees. At this moment, the entire venue resonated with enthusiastic applause. After the gathering, the President received us in the national guesthouse garden, adorned with fluttering flags and blooming flowers, and shook hands with each of us, repeatedly saying, "Welcome to Kenya!"

Yes, it can be said that Sino-Kenyan friendship has become the main melody of our reporting in Kenya. Whether in the capital Nairobi, the famous city of the Rift Valley Nakuru, or in the President's hometown Baringo, the port city of Mombasa; whether among colleagues at the Kenya Times, or in various government departments, in rural areas or factories, we have all received warm and sincere receptions. People regard the Chinese personnel as messengers of friendship. Especially in Mombasa, the regional chairman Nasir and other responsible officials not only meticulously arranged our interview schedule but also accompanied us throughout the visit. The welcoming rally with over 500 people, the youth's wonderful performances and parade, and the repeated shouts of "Long live the friendship between the Chinese and Kenyan peoples" were truly moving.

History and Today

The long-term development of Sino-Kenyan friendship is not accidental. As the KANU Mombasa District Chairman pointed out, the peoples of Kenya and China have had friendly exchanges since ancient times. He specially accompanied us to visit the Fort Jesus National Museum in Mombasa. There, we saw a large number of Chinese ceramics from the Tang Dynasty, especially from the Ming and Qing Dynasties. These historical relics have been treasured by the Kenyan people as evidence of the long-standing friendship between Kenya and China. It is known that as early as in the ancient Chinese book "Journey to the West," there were detailed descriptions of Chinese people reaching Kenya and the customs along the Kenyan coast. In 1414 and 1415, envoys from "Malindi" (near the current Malindi region of Mombasa) successively presented giraffes and zebras to the Ming Dynasty. The Ming Dynasty envoy Zheng He had visited Malindi and Mombasa. All this shows that Sino-Kenyan friendship is deep-rooted.

After the founding of New China and Kenya's independence, especially since President Moi took office, the friendly relations between the two countries have been growing on a new basis. President Moi visited China in 1980 and 1988, and Premier Zhao Ziyang visited Kenya in 1983, which has continuously deepened the political and economic relations between the two countries. The relationship between the two parties has also developed. Sino-Kenyan friendship is like a gentle rain showering into people's hearts.

On the basis of equality and mutual benefit, Sino-Kenyan economic cooperation relations have been continuously strengthened. The trade volume between the two countries in 1988 increased by 23% compared to 1987. Some joint ventures have entered the substantive preparation stage. The Kar-Tana Road in the Baringo region, constructed by the China Road and Bridge Corporation, and the National Sports Complex in Nairobi, built by the Sichuan Company, are regarded by Kenyan friends as eternal symbols of Sino-Kenyan friendly cooperation. Kenyan friends enthusiastically invited us to visit the difficult section of the Kar-Tana Road under construction. Standing on the observation deck between the steep cliffs of the Great Rift Valley, overlooking the winding mountain road, and witnessing the cars flying up and down, Kenyan friends repeatedly praised the role of this road in promoting regional and external economic exchanges. We were happy to see that Chinese engineering and technical personnel had sweated here with Kenyan friends.

A Friendship That Withstands Storms

What is even more gratifying is that this visit has made us deeply realize that whether under sunny skies or stormy weather, the friendship between the Chinese and Kenyan peoples will last like the mountains of Kenya and Mount Tai.

China and Kenya are both part of the Third World and have had similar unfortunate experiences in history. Today, they both face the arduous task of building their own countries. In international affairs, the two countries have broad consensus on major international issues. Now, in promoting South-South cooperation and establishing a new international political and economic order, there are many common languages.

We arrived in Nairobi just as the conflict involving some African students assaulting Chinese students and teachers in Nanjing was happening. Some Western journalists took the opportunity to make distorted reports. In Kenya, although some newspapers reprinted reports from Western news agencies, we did not hear any unfriendly remarks about China from Kenyans wherever we went. When we flew from the capital to "the Gateway of East Africa" Mombasa, in the waiting lounge of Jomo Kenyatta International Airport, we heard a very insightful speech from Peter, our escort. He said, "Every country has its own laws. The task of African students going to China is to study, not to find girlfriends..." His attitude and the enthusiastic reception we received when we arrived in Mombasa further illustrate that the friendship between China and Kenya and the friendship between the Chinese and African peoples can withstand storms. The tree of Sino-Kenyan friendship is growing, and the sunlight of friendship makes it more and more robust. Storms and rains can only make it more resilient.

### 深厚的中肯友谊

　　深厚的中肯友谊
    本报记者  徐德文  申明河
    踏上采访黑非洲的第一程——肯尼亚的大地，我们时刻感受到中肯友谊的深厚。
    　　　　友谊主旋律
    抵达内罗毕当天，未及歇息，肯尼亚民族联盟党中央的工作人员彼得先生很快就来到我们住处，对人民日报记者组前来采访表示热烈欢迎，并邀请我们第二天一早就前往约２００公里外的纳库鲁地区访问。我们在肯盟纳库鲁地区党部主席和多位地方官员陪同下，于１９８８年１２月最后一天，来到纳库鲁湖畔。那茫茫的碧波上，旋飞着、歇息着千千万万只美丽的火烈鸟，像飞絮，又像羽霞，蔚为奇观。午餐后，地区党部主席突然含笑地告诉我们：“每年新年前夕，莫伊总统都到这里参加群众集会并发表新年贺词，值此机会，总统今天下午乐意接见你们……”这消息，使我们感到十分高兴。原来，我们甚至未及看看美丽的首都内罗毕就被邀请到纳库鲁，竟是为了这样一项破格的礼遇。我们被安排在主席台上离总统约两米处就坐。当盛大的文艺演出结束后，总统发表讲话。他在谈到肯尼亚的朋友遍天下时，一再谈到与中国的友好关系，并把我们介绍给与会群众。这时全场响起阵阵热烈掌声。集会后，总统又在彩旗飘扬、鲜花盛开的国宾馆花园里接见了我们，同我们亲切地一一握手，连声说：“欢迎你们到肯尼亚来！”
    是的，可以说，中肯友谊，已成为我们在肯尼亚采访中的主旋律。无论是在首都内罗毕、裂谷名城纳库鲁，还是在总统故乡巴林戈、港城蒙巴萨；无论是在《肯尼亚时报》的同行中，还是在政府的各部门，在农村还是在工厂，我们都受到热烈的真诚的接待。人们把来自中国的人员看作友谊的使者。尤其是在蒙巴萨，地区党部主席纳西尔等负责官员不仅为我们精心安排了采访节目，而且全程陪同参观访问。那５００多人的欢迎集会，青少年们演出的精彩节目和队列表演，以及一次又一次高呼向中国人民致敬，是多么令人感动。
    　　　　历史与今天
    中肯友谊的长足发展，决非偶然。正如肯盟蒙巴萨区部党主席所指出，肯中两国人民在历史上早就有友好交往。他特地陪同我们参观蒙巴萨耶苏城堡国家博物馆。在那里，我们看到唐代特别是明、清两代的大量中国陶瓷。这些历史文物已被肯尼亚人民作为肯中悠久友谊的见证而加以珍藏。人们知道，早在中国古籍《经行记》中就有中国人到达肯尼亚和对肯尼亚沿海风俗的详细描述。１４１４年和１４１５年，“麻林国”（今蒙巴萨附近马林迪地区）使者先后向明朝赠送长颈鹿和斑马；明朝使节郑和曾访问过马林迪和蒙巴萨等地。这一切都说明，中肯友谊源远流长。
    新中国成立和肯尼亚独立后，特别是莫伊总统执政以来，两国友好关系在新的基础上与日俱增。莫伊总统１９８０年和１９８８年先后两次访华，赵紫阳总理１９８３年访问肯尼亚，使两国政治、经济关系不断增进。两党的关系也有所发展。中肯友谊就像阵阵春雨洒进人们的心田。
    在平等互利的基础上，中肯经济合作关系不断加强。两国１９８８年贸易额比１９８７年增长２３％。一些合营企业已进入实质性筹备阶段。由中国路桥公司承包的巴林戈地区卡—坦公路和四川公司承建的内罗毕国家体育综合设施，被肯尼亚朋友誉为中肯友好合作的永恒象征。肯尼亚朋友热情邀请我们前往修建卡—坦公路艰巨的地段参观。站在东非大裂谷峭壁夹峙的观景台上，俯瞰曲折的盘山公路，目睹一辆辆汽车飞旋上下，肯尼亚朋友一再赞扬这条公路对促进该地区和对外经济交流所起的作用，我们则为中国工程技术人员曾同肯尼亚朋友一道在这里洒下辛勤的汗水而感到高兴。
    　　　　风雨识相知
    更为令人欣慰的是，这次访问使我们更深深地体会到，无论艳日晴空，还是风雨晦暝，中肯人民之间的友谊都像肯尼亚山和泰山一样长存。
    中肯两国同属第三世界，历史上有过近似的不幸遭遇，今天又面临着相同的建设自己国家的艰巨任务。在国际事务中，我们两国对重大国际问题有着广泛一致的看法。如今，在促进南南合作，建立国际政治、经济新秩序的斗争中，有着许多共同语言。
    我们抵达内罗毕前恰值南京发生某些非洲学生殴打中国师生而引起的冲突事件。一些西方记者借机作了连篇累牍的歪曲报道。在肯尼亚，尽管有的报纸转载了西方通讯社的报道，但是我们所到之处，从未听到肯尼亚人对中国发表不友好的言论。我们从首都飞向“东非门户”蒙巴萨时，在肯雅塔国际机场候机室，就听到陪同的彼得先生一段很有见地的谈话。他说，“任何一个国家都有自己的法律。非洲学生到中国去的任务是学习，而不是去找女孩子……”他的态度和我们到达蒙巴萨访问时受到的热情款待进一步说明，中肯两国和中非人民的友谊是经得起风风雨雨的。中肯友谊之树在不断成长，友谊的阳光使它日益茁壮，风风雨雨只能使它更加挺拔。
