	U.S. companies are speeding up their merger activities in Europe, fearing that after 1992, they may find it difficult to enter the European market or expand their influence.

	According to some investment companies on Wall Street, more and more U.S. companies are rushing to expand their foothold in Western Europe's food and consumer goods industries. Some companies are even trying to break into industries that have long been protected by European Community countries, such as telecommunications and financial services.

	Last year, U.S. companies spent $3.6 billion on mergers in Europe, nearly double the $1.3 billion spent in 1987.

	A responsible person from the merger department of Bankers Trust Company estimates that this year, U.S. companies may spend as much as $5 billion on acquiring European companies.

　　美公司加紧在欧洲兼并
    今年兼并费用将达五十亿美元
    新华社纽约１月１７日电  （记者薛力敏）美国一些大公司纷纷加紧在欧洲的兼并活动，以免在１９９２年以后难以打进欧洲市场，或扩大在欧洲的影响。
    据华尔街一些投资公司的人士说，越来越多的美国公司争相扩大自己在西欧食品工业和消费品工业中的立足点，有些公司甚至在努力打入长期以来一直受到欧洲共同体国家保护的工业，如电讯、金融服务等。
    去年，美国公司在欧洲兼并企业花费了３６亿美元，比１９８７年的１３亿美元增加近２倍。
    银行家信托公司兼并部的一位负责人估计，今年美国公司用于吞并欧洲企业的费用可能会达到５０亿美元。
