The President of the Republic of Mali and the Executive Chairman of the Organization of African Unity, Moussa Traoré, is scheduled to make an official visit to China from January 25 to 28. This will be Traoré's fourth visit to China.

In 1961, he returned to his country to participate in the establishment of the Malian army. He later served as an instructor and deputy director of the Kati Military Academy in Mali. On November 19, 1968, he led a group of young officers in a coup, overthrowing the government of Modibo Keïta, establishing the National Liberation Military Committee, and serving as its chairman and commander-in-chief of the armed forces, assuming the duties of the head of state. From September 1969, he also served as the head of the government. From May 1978 to June 1986, he concurrently served as the Minister of Defense. In October 1978, he was promoted to the rank of brigadier general. In March 1979, he became the General Secretary of the Malian People's Democratic Union. In June of the same year, he was elected as the President of the Second Republic. In October 1982, he was promoted to the rank of general. In June 1985, he was re-elected as the President of the Republic and has held the position since. In May 1988, he was elected as the Executive Chairman of the 24th Organization of African Unity.

Since taking office as the Executive Chairman of the OAU, Traoré has made active contributions in international relations and the resolution of conflicts in African countries. He has actively promoted the resolution of conflicts in regions such as Chad, Western Sahara, and Southern Africa, bringing the parties closer to reconciliation. Under his mediation, Guinea and Côte d'Ivoire, Senegal, and Mauritania have achieved reconciliation, and relations between Senegal and Mauritania have also improved.

Traoré is an old friend of the Chinese people and attaches great importance to the development of friendly cooperation between China and Mali. He has made significant contributions to the friendship between the two peoples. He has visited China three times. This visit will certainly make a positive contribution to strengthening and developing Sino-African friendship and the friendly cooperative relationship between China and Mali.
