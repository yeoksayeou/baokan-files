In Nanjiang County, where the Red Army established the revolutionary base of Sichuan and Shaanxi, a tall gray natural marble monument now stands. This was built last August by the people of Nanjiang County to bid farewell to the medical team from the People's Liberation Army 324 Hospital that supported the old revolutionary base. It, like the monument built by the people of the old revolutionary base for the Red Army, inscribes another new chapter of the people's children soldiers carrying forward the tradition of loving the people.

Located in the Daba Mountains, Nanjiang County is one of the 108 key poverty-stricken counties in the country. Economic poverty has made the medical and health services here extremely backward. Since June 1985, the 324 Hospital has sent six medical teams to Nanjiang to prevent and treat diseases for the people of the old revolutionary base and to develop medical and health services.

Over the past four years, the medical team of this hospital has covered all three districts and 26 townships in Nanjiang. Wherever they go, they first visit the old Red Army soldiers, the families of martyrs, the five-guarantee households, and the specially difficult households, conducting physical examinations and providing free medical treatment for them.

To fundamentally help the old revolutionary base get rid of the shortage of medical personnel and medicines, the 324 Hospital has provided support to Nanjiang County in terms of medical technology and equipment on one hand, and on the other hand, it has trained medical technical cadres for the old revolutionary base.

　　三二四医院发扬爱民传统    
    支援南江老区发展医疗事业
    据新华社重庆１月２４日电（记者刘前刚、通讯员向平）在当年红军建立川陕革命根据地的南江县，如今又矗立起一座青灰色天然大理石纪念碑。这是去年８月，四川南江县人民为送别解放军３２４医院支援革命老区医疗队而兴建的。它同老区人民为当年红军建造的丰碑一样，镌刻下了人民子弟兵发扬爱民传统的又一新篇章。
    地处大巴山的南江县，是全国１０８个重点扶贫县之一，经济的贫穷使这里医疗卫生事业极为落后。１９８５年６月以来，３２４医院先后派出６批医疗队奔赴南江，为老区人民防病治病，发展医疗卫生事业。
    ４年来，这个医院医疗队的足迹，踏遍了南江３个区２６个乡。他们每到一处，都首先对老红军、烈士家属、五保户、特困户进行走访、体检，免费为他们治病。
    为了使老区从根本上摆脱缺医少药的状况，３２４医院一方面从医疗技术设备上给南江县以支持，另一方面为老区培养医疗技术骨干。
