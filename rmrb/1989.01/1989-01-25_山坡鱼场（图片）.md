Farmers in Shixian County's Shuimotou Village in the Taihang Mountains of Shanxi Province have turned their vision of building a red trout farm on the hillside using the village's abundant spring water into reality. The water temperature in the village's springs remains consistently between 12°C and 14°C, which is ideal for the growth of red trout. The current production capacity is 10,000 kilograms per year.
