A New Spark of National Wisdom – A Record of Explosives Inventor Wang Xuguang

Reporter Wang Yougong

	This line of work is dangerous, but it can reduce the threat of explosives to workers' lives. He decided to stick with it.

Wang Xuguang graduated from the Polymer Chemistry Department of Anhui University in the early 1960s. In 1971, he was transferred to the Mining Explosives Research Group of the Metallurgical Ministry's Mining and Smelting Institute. During one experiment, an explosive misfired, and shrapnel flying out of the observation hole injured his head and left leg.

Explosives are more dangerous than tigers, and researching explosives is like skinning a tiger—a job fraught with danger. After the accident, most of his colleagues changed their fields. Should he continue? The scene where he nearly lost his life often flashed before his eyes, and for a moment, Wang Xuguang hesitated.

Soon, he visited Benxi Nanfen Iron Mine, one of China's largest iron mines, and saw firsthand how backward China's mining explosives were. In the depths of winter, workers carried blocks of explosives that had frozen into ice lumps, with a high workload. Especially those misfires—the "duds"—who knows when accidentally touching one might cause an explosion, often leading to unimaginable consequences. The workers sincerely hoped for the help of experts. Wang Xuguang thought, "Although this line of work is dangerous, it can reduce the threat of explosives to people." He decided to stick with it.

Starting with the most urgent problems facing mining explosives, Wang Xuguang and his colleagues solved a series of issues related to the safety performance of explosives. They used mines as their research base and worked for nine years, achieving six results. Among them, a type of slurry explosive he led the development of, created a production value of several hundred million yuan soon after it was put into production, and won the National Science Conference Award. His research and application of cassava gum won the National Invention Third Prize.

	The nation that once contributed to humanity with the invention of ancient explosives must also contribute to modern explosives. This became his driving force for research and struggle.

In the 1970s, the international research on explosives took a new step. The American company Ellice Chemical developed a type of high-velocity, high-power, non-polluting, soft-as-dough emulsified explosive. It had extremely strong water resistance, and even after being soaked in water for 10 days, its explosive performance did not change much; in addition to being detonated by a blasting cap, even shooting it with a rifle bullet would not cause it to burn or explode.

In 1978, China, which had recovered, opened its curtains to the world. That summer, the famous American mining expert Dr. Cook was invited to China for a technical exchange. At a meeting, he revealed information about the 12 years his country had spent developing emulsified explosives. Wang Xuguang, who participated in the discussion, hoped the expert would provide more details, but the answer was a series of shakes of the head and "NO, NO..."

As a Chinese explosives expert, Wang Xuguang felt a deep sense of humiliation that night. He woke up his wife, who was already asleep, and recounted the day's events, then swore, "I must conquer it!" The next day at work, he ignited a "fire" within the group.

The Mining Explosives Research Group's entire inventory was just some pots and pans and other simple equipment. To achieve the "jewel" of the modern explosives field—emulsified explosives—under such conditions was no easy task. Soon, various opinions began to circulate domestically and internationally. However, they paid no heed and worked day and night on experiments.

To configure emulsified explosives, a 30% oil-to-70% water ratio is required through an emulsifier. Someone predicted: Even with a high-level mixer, it would be difficult to achieve uniform emulsification. Without mixing equipment, they had to mix by hand. Each experiment required two pots of explosives, each needing to be mixed for over half an hour, causing their arms to swell. As spring turned to autumn, over several months, they tested thousands of formulas, accumulating thousands of data points, and detonated over 2,000 charges. With the cooperation of the Beijing Daily Chemical Research Institute, after nine months of repeated experiments, they finally found a reasonable emulsification process, allowing China's newest generation of explosives to be born.

Immediately, they went to the Shangri-La Plateau in Hebei Province's Xuanhua Longyuan Iron Mine to conduct industrial production trials of emulsified explosives.

A type of emulsified explosive with Chinese characteristics was successfully developed. They completed in one year what the first country to develop this type of explosive took 12 years to achieve. This explosive was quickly applied in the Gezhouba Dam Project on the Yangtze River, the lower tunnel project of the Jialing River in Sichuan, and the Yunjin Water Diversion Project. The tunnel excavation speed doubled, ensuring the entire project was completed one season ahead of schedule, bringing over 100 million yuan in economic benefits to Tianjin.

	The Swedish explosives company named after the father of modern explosives, Nobel, bought this technology.

The success of China's emulsified explosives shocked international peers.

In November 1984, Wang Xuguang was invited to attend the 12th International Mining Conference in New Delhi, India. When he took the stage to speak, the attendees applauded enthusiastically. Conference Technical Chairman Professor Gauss shook his hand and said, "Your valuable paper and your attendance have made this conference a milestone in the history of world mining conferences."

In 1985, the Swedish company Nobel, named after the father of modern explosives, sent experts to China twice to conduct inspections. They finally signed a technology transfer contract to purchase China's emulsified explosive production technology for tens of thousands of dollars, thus realizing the first paid export of China's explosives technology in modern history.

In 1986, this achievement won the National Invention Second Prize and the National Technology Progress Award. In December of the same year, at the 35th Eureka World Invention Expo, it won the gold medal, demonstrating the new contribution of intelligent Chinese people in this field to humanity.

In recent years, Wang Xuguang, in response to the actual needs of economic construction, has led the development of explosives that can be safely used in coal mines with high gas and sulfur content and high-temperature-resistant explosives. To organize the experience accumulated over the years in explosives research, he lived in the laboratory for over three years, working until late at night every day. His hard work paid off, and he combined several major achievements to write three books totaling over a million words on explosives research, which have been highly regarded by domestic and international peers. Dr. Mohan of the Indian Explosives Research Institute wrote in a letter after seeing his recently published book "Emulsified Explosives": "I am sure that this book is very useful for all researchers in the field of explosives. I congratulate you on completing the difficult task of writing a book like 'Emulsified Explosives' that involves multiple disciplines." Dr. Bartworth, manager of the international technology department of the American DuPont Company, praised the book as the world's first systematic monograph on emulsified explosives, very practical and valuable. Several foreign publishers competed to translate and publish it. Recently, this book also won the National Excellent Science and Technology Book First Prize.

Not long ago, Wang Xuguang was evaluated as a scientist with outstanding contributions to the nation.

　　民族智慧的新闪光
    ——记炸药发明家汪旭光
    本报记者  王友恭
    　　　　干这一行虽然危险，但可以减少炸药对工人兄弟生命的威胁。他决
    　　心干下去
    ６０年代初从安徽大学化学系高分子专业毕业的汪旭光，１９７１年被调到冶金部矿冶院矿山炸药研究组工作。一次试验，炸药误爆，从观察孔里飞出来的弹片使他头部挂彩，小腿受伤。
    炸药猛于虎，研制炸药如同与虎谋皮，是一项潜伏着生命危险的工作。事故发生后，组内的同事大都改了行。还要不要坚持下去？那个差点让人送命的场面常常浮现在眼前，一时间，汪旭光有些犹豫。
    不久，他到我国大型铁矿之一的本溪南汾铁矿考察，亲眼看到我国的矿山炸药太落后了。寒冬腊月，工人们肩扛背驮一块块结成了冰疙瘩的炸药，劳动强度很大。特别是那些拒爆的炸药——“哑炮”，不知什么时候无意碰它一下却又爆炸了，往往造成不堪设想的后果。工人师傅恳切希望得到专家的帮助。汪旭光想：“干这一行虽然危险，但可以减少炸药对人的威胁。”他决心干下去。
    从矿山炸药最急需解决的问题入手，汪旭光和同事们先后解决了炸药安全性能等一系列问题。他们以矿山为科研基地，一干就是９年，先后取得６项成果。其中，由他主持研制成功的一种浆状炸药，投产后不久就创几千万元的产值，获全国科学大会奖。他的关于田菁胶的研究和应用获得国家发明三等奖。
    　　　　曾以发明古代炸药为人类作出过贡献的民族，也要为现代炸药作出
    　　贡献。这成为他钻研、拚搏的动力
    ２０世纪７０年代，国际上的炸药研制又迈上了新的台阶。美国的爱丽斯化学公司研制了一种具有高爆速、高威力、无污染、软得像面团一样的乳化炸药。它的抗水性能极强，即便在水中浸泡１０天，爆炸性能变化也不大；除了用雷管引爆之外，甚至用步枪子弹射击，也不会燃烧和爆炸。
    １９７８年，复苏的中国拉开了展望世界的帷幔。这年夏季，美国著名的采矿专家库克博士应邀来我国进行技术交流，在一次会上透露了该国用１２年时间研制成乳化炸药的信息。参加座谈的汪旭光希望博士详细介绍一下，得到的回答是不住的摇头和一连串的“ＮＯ，ＮＯ……”
    作为一个中国的炸药专家，汪旭光此时感到一种难以忍受的酸楚。那天晚上，他回到家，推醒已入梦乡的妻子，讲述了白天那一幕，然后发誓般地说：“我非要攻克它不可！”第二天上班后，又在组内点着了一把“火”。
    矿山炸药研制组的全部家当，也就是些盆盆罐罐等简陋设备。要在这种条件下摘取乳化炸药这个现代炸药领域中的“明珠”，谈何容易。一时间，各种议论相继从国内外传来。然而，他们全然不顾，只是没日没夜地试验。
    配制乳化炸药要通过乳化剂，用３０％的油配上７０％的水。有人预言：即便用很高级的搅拌器搅拌也难以实现均匀乳化。没有搅拌设备，他们只好用手搅。试验一次，要配制两锅炸药，每一锅要搅拌半个钟头以上，胳膊都搅肿了。春去秋来，几个月时间内，他们搞了上千个配方，积累了几千个数据，前后试放了２０００多炮。在北京日用化学研究所的配合下，经过９个月的反复试验，终于找到了合理的乳化工艺路线，使中国最新一代的炸药“婴儿”得以降生。
    紧接着，他们前往坝上高原的河北省宣化龙烟铁矿，进行乳化炸药的工业化生产试验。
    一种具有中国特色的乳化炸药研制成功了。他们只用了一年的时间，就走完了世界上第一个研制这种炸药的国家１２年走过的路。这种炸药很快在长江葛洲坝工程、四川嘉陵江下隧道工程上应用。用到引滦入津工程上，隧道开掘进度提高了一倍，保证了整个工程提前一个季度完成，为天津带来经济效益１亿多元。
    　　　　以现代炸药之父诺贝尔命名的一家瑞典炸药公司，买走了这项技术
    　　中国乳化炸药的研制成功震动了国际同行。
    １９８４年１１月，汪旭光应邀出席在印度新德里召开的第十二届国际采矿大会。当他走上讲台发言时，与会者报以热烈的掌声。大会技术主席高斯教授握住他的手说：“您有价值的论文和您的与会，使这次大会成为世界采矿大会史上的一个里程碑。”
    １９８５年，以现代火药之父诺贝尔命名的瑞典尼特罗·诺贝尔公司先后两次派专家来华考察，最后以数十万美元转让费签订了购买中国乳化炸药生产技术的转让合同，从而实现了近代史上我国炸药技术第一次向国外有偿输出。
    １９８６年这项成果获国家发明二等奖和国家技术进步奖。同年１２月，在第３５届尤里卡世界发明博览会上获得金奖昭示了聪明的中国人在这方面对人类做出的新贡献。
    近几年来，汪旭光结合经济建设的实际需要，又主持研制成功了可在瓦斯和含硫成份高的矿井里安全使用的炸药和耐高温炸药。为了把这些年来研制炸药积累起来的经验整理出来，他住了三年多实验室，每天工作到下半夜。功夫不负苦心人，就这样，他结合几项重大成果，先后写出三本上百万字的有关炸药研制的专著，受到国内外同行的重视。印度爆炸基础研究所的高级科学家蒙汗博士看到他前不久出版的《乳化炸药》一书后来信说：“我确信，这本书对于炸药领域里的所有研究者都是非常有用的。我祝贺你完成了像《乳化炸药》这样涉及多学科的书的困难写作任务。”美国杜邦公司国际技术部经理巴特沃斯博士称赞这本书是世界上第一本系统阐述乳化炸药的专著，非常适用和有价值。好几家外国出版商争相要求翻译出版。最近，这本书又获全国优秀科技图书一等奖。
    前不久，汪旭光被评为国家级有突出贡献的科学家。
