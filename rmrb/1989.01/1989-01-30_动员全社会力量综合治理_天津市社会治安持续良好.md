Seven lawless peddlers who defied the law, bullied the market, injured customers, and interfered with people's representatives in their inspection duties were publicly dealt with today in Tianjin. By mobilizing all of society's forces for comprehensive governance and striking down any signs of wrongdoing, Tianjin has maintained good social order.

On December 31 last year, Tianjin's Hexi District People's Representative Guan Kai and his colleague Wang Jin criticized a private vendor for selling watermelons that were short in weight and presented their people's representative inspection certificates. The surrounding private vendors, including Yuan Shouwen, rushed forward to cause trouble, beating Wang Jin so severely that his left rib was fractured, and beating Guan Kai so badly that his nose bled and his waist was injured. They then fled. After a night of pursuit by the police, two of the criminals are still at large, but the other seven assailants have been captured. On January 26, three were arrested by law, two were sent to re-education through labor, and the remaining two are undergoing further investigation. These actions have been met with approval by the citizens.

It is reported that Tianjin's criminal case rate has remained stable at around 5.8 per 10,000 people over the past few years, which is the lowest among major cities in the country. A public security official told the reporter that the hard-won sense of security among the citizens mainly comes from the comprehensive governance of the entire society:

	•	Widely mobilizing the masses to maintain order, firmly supporting and commending those who dare to manage and fight for public security. Over the years, a multi-layered community watch network has been formed. Last year, 1,760 public security models emerged, helping 20,000 wayward youths to reform, with 80% showing improvement.

	•	The masses' daring to manage and fight is also due to the specialized agencies' insistence on the "strike hard" policy against serious criminal activities, maintaining a "high-pressure" situation and deterrent effect. During high-incidence seasons and in complex areas, patrols and preventive measures are strengthened step by step, and decisive actions are taken.

	•	Insisting on strict discipline within the police force, promoting a spirit of self-sacrifice. In the relentless struggle, each officer works an average of over 100 extra days per year. Since the "strike hard" campaign, the bureau has lost 11 officers in the line of duty, over 100 have been injured, 636 units have been named advanced collectives, and 3,953 officers have been commended for their work. The outstanding Communist Party member Liu Ying, who died from overwork, is a representative figure.

Tianjin's public security situation is far from being complacent. The public security bureau mentioned an example to the reporter: "Theft of public property" is still serious. In a certain factory, 1 ton of raw materials worth 160,000 yuan was stolen. When the public security personnel intercepted the stolen goods and questioned the factory director, he was completely unaware.

### 动员全社会力量综合治理  天津市社会治安持续良好

　　动员全社会力量综合治理    
    天津市社会治安持续良好
    本报天津１月２８日电  记者肖荻报道：７名蔑视法律、欺行霸市、打伤顾客并干扰人民代表行使检查权的不法商贩，今天在天津被公开处理。动员全社会力量综合治理，见歪风邪气露头就打，使天津社会治安持续良好。
    去年１２月３１日，天津河西区人大代表关凯和同事王津因批评一个体商贩售水果缺斤短两，并出示人民代表检查证，围观的个体商贩袁世文等人趋前滋事，将王津打得左胸一肋骨折，将关凯打得鼻部出血，腰部拙伤后外逃。经干警深夜缉捕，除２名案犯在逃，其余７名打人凶手捉拿归案。１月２６日３名被依法逮捕，２名被劳动教养，其余２名正在进一步审查。这些，使市民称快。
    据悉，天津刑事发案率几年来基本稳定在人口的万分之五点八左右，在全国各大城市中是最低的。市公安局负责人向记者谈到，市民来之不易的安全感，主要来自于全社会力量的综合治理：
    ——广泛动员群众维持治安，对敢管敢斗的治安积极分子给以坚决支持和大力表彰。几年来已形成多层次群防群控网络，去年涌现１７６０名治安模范，他们帮助２万失足青少年改过，其中８０％有好转。
    ——群众的敢管敢斗又得力于专门机关对严重刑事犯罪活动坚持“严打”方针，并一直保持“高压”态势和威慑作用。对高发季节和复杂地段，一环扣一环地加强巡逻防范，采取果断措施。
    ——坚持从严治警，弘扬献身精神。在日以继夜的斗争中，干警每人每年平均加班１００多个工作日。“严打”以来全局先后有１１名干警壮烈牺牲，１００多名同志负伤，出现６３６个先进集体，３９５３名干警立功。超负荷工作积劳瘁死的优秀共产党员刘英就是一个代表人物。
    天津市治安情况绝非高枕无忧。市公安局向记者谈到一个例子：“盗公”现象仍严重。某工厂价值１６万元１吨的原材料被盗，公安人员截获后去查问，该厂厂长竟毫无所知。
