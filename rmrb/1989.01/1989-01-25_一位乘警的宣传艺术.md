A conductor police officer's art of propaganda

By Duan Cunchang, reporter for this newspaper

“Let me talk about an important issue, let me talk about a big issue,” a middle-aged man in a police uniform walked into the car, his expression very tense as he shouted. I thought something had happened on the train, theft, fire... The seated passengers stood up, those who were playing stopped, those who were reading looked up, and those who were sleeping woke up!

When everyone was ready to listen to the news, the conductor police officer calmly and with a smile extended two fingers and said: “Let me tell everyone the first thing, prevent theft, keep your money safe; the second thing, safety, your family is waiting for you at home!”

The passengers just let out a sigh of relief.

“Tonight is the most dangerous,” the conductor police officer reminded the passengers: “Yesterday you got on the train in Beijing, you don’t know anyone, thieves don’t dare to act. After a day of travel and observation, they know where you put your things. You fall asleep, they commit the crime; a five-minute stop, you go to the platform to buy something to eat, they take the opportunity to steal. What to do? Your wallet, hanging on the coat hook is not safe, placing it under the seat is not secure, it’s best to carry it with you, and when sleeping, press it under your pillow.”

Then the conductor police officer analyzed: “At different times, the incidents on the train are also different. Take the sleeper car for example, the passengers in the 1980s are very different from the 1960s, in the past it was mostly cadres who sat, now the people on the train are very mixed, individual businessmen sit on the train, carrying tens of thousands or even hundreds of thousands of cash. So, don’t think that sitting in a sleeper car is safe, theft cases in sleeper cars are more than in hard-seat cars.”

“Look, this finger of mine was injured by a thief.” The conductor police officer extended his finger with a scar and said: “Once I fought with a bad guy on the train, the 100-plus people present did not dare to come forward, almost cost me my life.” He also reported to the passengers the current cases of robbing police uniforms and guns in society, and the passengers gathered around him like students listening to a lecture.

“Comrades, it’s up to you to believe it or not. If you can do as I say, I guarantee you will arrive safely in Guangzhou.”

The passengers applauded enthusiastically. A young passenger jumped up and shouted, “Long live the conductor police officer!” A young man who was woken up by the conductor police officer, initially unhappy, listened to the propaganda, and he reached out to pat the bag placed next to him and smiled.

I was moved by the conductor police officer’s work attitude. After he finished speaking in all 18 cars, I chatted with him in the staff room (there is no police office on the train).

He is the conductor police officer team leader of the Guangzhou Railway Passenger Segment Jingqi Package Team, named Cai Xurong, code number 0183.

“When did you start this work?” I asked.

“It has been more than 10 years. Every time the train departs from Guangzhou, I go through each car and speak. When returning from Beijing, I speak again.”

“What is the effect?”

“The passengers are alert, preventing before it happens, everyone prevents, which is more powerful than our police force. In the cars where I have spoken, cases are rarely seen.”

“Why is what you say attractive?”

“I give the passengers transparency, letting everyone know the current situation of anti-theft and safety on the train. I also studied the psychology of passengers and the patterns of criminals’ actions.”

A few days later, I saw Cai Xurong again in the office building of Guangzhou Railway Station. He was busy giving a lecture to the police officer training class. From the Guangzhou Railway Public Security Bureau Police Officer Team’s work report, I saw four records of Comrade Cai Xurong:

On March 6, 1987, a pair of farmer brothers were found in the soft sleeper car to be smuggling gold, and 830 grams of gold were seized. The criminals attempted to bribe, either sharing the gold or giving 200,000 yuan in cash, all of which were rejected by Cai Xurong, who handled the matter according to law, and the gold was handed over to the state treasury.

In June 1987, Cai Xurong found 8 pieces of state cultural relics and 10,400 yuan in cash being smuggled under a hard-seat car. The criminal escaped. Cai Xurong remained unmoved by the money and handed it all over.

On June 20, 1988, Cai Xurong found more than a pound of gold being smuggled by two farmers from Guangdong in car 13 of the hard sleeper. They asked someone to intercede, but Cai Xurong paid no attention and handled the matter according to law.

On July 17, 1988, Cai Xurong found a passenger’s bag in the hard sleeper washroom, containing 280,000 yuan in cash. He thought of every way to find the owner. The owner, to thank him, first gave 300 yuan, which was not accepted; the second time gave a box of imported cigarettes, which was also not accepted; the third time gave three boxes of drinks, which was still not accepted.

Cai Xurong joined the party in 1974. His family of six is not well-off. His parents, over 70 years old, still have their household registration in the countryside. His wife, Chen Cuirong, is a teacher at the Fuyin Kindergarten in Dongshan District, Guangzhou. She said: “My Cai is dedicated to the safety of the passengers!”

　　一位乘警的宣传艺术
    本报记者  段存章
    “我讲一个重要问题，我讲一个大问题”，一位衣着警服的中年人走进车厢，神情十分紧张地喊着。我以为车上出了什么事，偷盗啦，火灾啦……坐着的旅客站了起来，正玩的旅客停了下来，看书的旅客抬起了头，睡觉的旅客也醒了！
    当人们竖起耳朵听新闻时，这位乘警却不慌不忙，面带微笑地伸出两个指头说：“我告诉大家第一件事，防盗，把钱保管好好的；第二件事，安全，你的亲人在家等着你！”
    旅客们刚松了一口气。
    “今晚最危险”，乘警提醒旅客：“昨天晚上你从北京上车，人不熟，小偷不敢动。经过一天旅行观察，知道你的东西放在什么位置。你睡了，他作案了；五分钟停车，你到站台买吃了，他趁机偷了。怎么办？你的钱包，挂在衣帽钩上不安全，放在座位下边不保险，最好随身带，睡觉时压在枕头下边。”
    接着乘警分析说：“不同时期，车上发案也不同。拿卧铺来说，８０年代乘客与６０年代大不一样，过去都是坐的干部，现在坐车人杂得很，个体户坐车，一带就是几万、几十万现金。所以，不要以为坐卧铺放心，偷盗案发生在卧铺里比硬座车厢还多。”
    “你们看，我这指头就是被偷犯刺伤的。”乘警伸出留下伤疤的手指说：“有次我在车上与坏人搏斗，在场的１００多人不敢上，差点把我小命贴上。”他还给旅客通报了目前社会上抢警衣、抢手枪等案例，旅客们围着他像一个个听课的学生。
    “同志们，就这样，信不信由你。如果你能按照我讲的去做，保你平安到达广州。”
    旅客们热烈鼓掌。有位青年旅客跳起来喊：“乘警万岁！”一位被乘警喊醒的小伙子，开始不高兴，听了宣传，他伸手摸摸身边放着的提包笑了。
    我被这位乘警的工作态度所感动。待他把１８个车厢挨次讲完后，我与他坐在乘务员工作室（车上没有乘警办公室）聊天。
    他是广州铁路客运段京七包乘组乘警组组长，名叫蔡许荣，代号０１８３。
    “你从什么时候开始这项工作的？”我问。
    “已１０多年了。每次从广州发车，我挨个车厢讲一遍。从北京返程，又讲一遍。”
    “效果如何？”
    “旅客警惕了，防在前，人人防，比我们乘警力量大。在我讲过的车厢里发案很少见。”
    “你讲的有吸引力，为啥？”
    “我是把透明度交给旅客，让大家清楚列车上防盗、安全的现状。我还研究了旅客的心理和案犯作案的规律。”
    数天后，我在广州火车站办公大楼里又一次见到蔡许荣。他正忙着给乘警学习班讲课。我从广州铁路公安分局乘警队乘务工作报告里，看到记录着蔡许荣同志四件事：
    １９８７年３月６日，软卧车厢里发现一对农民兄弟是搞黄金走私的，查获黄金８３０克。罪犯企图行贿，或黄金分半，或送人民币２万元，都被蔡许荣拒绝，并依法办事，黄金交入国库。
    １９８７年６月，蔡许荣一人在硬座下查出走私国家文物８件，并有现款１０４００元，案犯潜逃。蔡在金钱面前不动心，如数上交。
    １９８８年６月２０日，蔡许荣在１３号硬卧车厢查获广东两个农民走私黄金１斤多，他们托人求情，蔡许荣不予理睬，依法处治。
    １９８８年７月１７日，蔡许荣在硬卧洗脸间捡到旅客提包一件，内装现款２．８万元。他想方设法找到失主，失主为酬谢他，第一次送款３００元，没要；第二次送来一条进口烟，也不要；第三次送来三箱饮料，还是不要。
    蔡许荣１９７４年入党。全家６口人，生活并不宽裕。７０多岁的父母亲户口仍在农村。他爱人陈翠红，是广州东山区福今幼儿园教师。她说：“俺那大蔡一心操在旅客安全上！”
