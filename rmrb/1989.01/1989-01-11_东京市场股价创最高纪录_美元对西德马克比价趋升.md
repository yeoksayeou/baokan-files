Tokyo stock prices hit a new high today. The dollar's exchange rate against the West German mark continues to rise.

The Tokyo stock market closed today with an average stock price of 30,678.39 yen, up 468.85 yen from the previous week, setting a new historical high.

Financial circles here had predicted that the death of Emperor Hirohito would cause stock prices to fall. However, from the start of trading this morning, led by Nippon Steel and Mitsubishi Heavy Industries, stock prices of listed companies soared.

Analysts attribute the rise in stock prices to investors' confidence in the new era following the enthronement of the new emperor, the continued growth of the Japanese domestic economy, and the improvement of the U.S. economic situation.

The dollar's exchange rate against the West German mark continued to rise on the Frankfurt foreign exchange market in West Germany.

Today, the official exchange rate of the dollar against the mark rose from 1:1.8022 at the close of trading last week to 1:1.8308. Despite the Deutsche Bundesbank's move to sell dollars today, it failed to stop the dollar's upward trend.

Since the beginning of the year, the dollar's exchange rate has been on a continuous upward trend. So far, the dollar's exchange rate in the Frankfurt foreign exchange market has risen by 5 pfennigs. Today alone, the dollar's exchange rate against the mark rose by nearly 3 pfennigs. To curb the rise in the dollar's exchange rate, the Deutsche Bundesbank sold $49.2 million today, but the market showed no reaction. On the contrary, after this measure was taken, the dollar's exchange rate against the mark once rose to a new high of 1:1.8325.

　　东京市场股价创最高纪录
    美元对西德马克比价趋升
    新华社东京１月９日电  东京股票市场今天收盘股票平均价格比上周末上涨４６８．８５日元，达３０６７８．３９日元，创历史最高纪录。
    此间金融界曾预测裕仁天皇逝世会造成股票价格下降，但是上午交易一开始就在新日铁、三菱重工公司股票的带领下，各上场公司股票价格直线上升。
    据分析，股票价格上升是因为投资家们对新天皇即位以后的新时代抱有信心，日本国内经济将维持增长和美国经济情况看好等。
    据新华社波恩１月９日电　（记者戴履斌）西德法兰克福外汇市场上美元汇率继续上扬不止。
    今天美元对马克的官方比价已由上周末收盘时的１∶１．８０２２上升到１∶１．８３０８。德意志联邦银行今天虽采取了抛售美元的措施，但也未能制止住美元涨势。
    今年伊始，美元汇率就开始不断上扬。据统计，到目前为止，美元在法兰克福外汇市场上的汇率已上涨５个芬尼。今天一天，美元对马克的比价就上升了近３个芬尼。为抑制美元汇率上升，德意志联邦银行今天抛售了４９２０万美元，但市场未作出任何反应。相反，在采取这一措施之后，美元对马克的比价曾一度上升至１∶１．８３２５的新水平。
