Public Funds Turned into Delicacies

On June 1, 1988, the Transportation Bureau of our city and the Office of the Provincial Transportation Bureau signed a contract: the city bureau would advance 160,000 yuan from the transportation management fees collected in the first half of 1988 as welfare funds for the provincial bureau, which would then invest the funds back to the city bureau. In return, the city bureau would provide the provincial bureau with 1,000 kilograms of chicken, 1,500 kilograms of eggs, and 3,000 kilograms of beef and mutton annually without compensation. After four years, the city bureau would return 40,000 yuan to the provincial bureau.

On June 10, the Transportation Bureau of our city signed another contract with the freshwater aquaculture farm in Ha'ernao Township, Beipiao City: the bureau would invest 160,000 yuan in the farm, which would then provide the bureau with 1,300 kilograms of chicken, 2,500 kilograms of eggs, and 3,500 kilograms of beef and mutton annually without compensation. After four years, the farm would return 40,000 yuan to the bureau. Notably, the contractee of this farm is the brother of the director of the city's Transportation Bureau.

After the contracts were signed, the city bureau had already transferred the 160,000 yuan to the freshwater aquaculture farm in Ha'ernao Township, Beipiao City. This farm has no chickens, ducks, cattle, or sheep, and all the supplies provided to the bureau were purchased.

The two contracts are seemingly perfect: pleasing the superiors, enriching oneself, and benefiting relatives.

Turning public funds into personal gains and then into delicacies on the dining table is, in my opinion, a disguised embezzlement of state assets and should be seriously dealt with.

Reply from Minzhisheng

Upon investigation, the issues raised by the reader are basically true.

In August 1988, the Transportation Bureau of Chaoyang City provided the Provincial Transportation Bureau with 2,000 kilograms of eggs, with each person receiving 25 kilograms and paying 30 yuan. In September 1988, the Provincial Transportation Bureau, in accordance with higher-level requirements, rectified this violation of financial discipline, terminated the agreement, and recovered the original 160,000 yuan in full. The leaders of the Provincial Transportation Bureau made a self-criticism at a full-staff meeting and also reported to the Provincial Transportation Department. The Provincial Transportation Department, acknowledging its supervisory failure, expressed its responsibility and submitted a written report to the Provincial Supervision Bureau.

　　公款变美味
    １９８８年６月１日，我市交通局运输处与省交通厅运输局办公室签定了一份合同：市局运输处从１９８８年上缴的运输管理费中预支１６万元，做为省厅运输局的福利基金，省厅运输局再投资给市局运输处；市局运输处则每年给省厅运输局无偿提供鸡１０００公斤、蛋１５００公斤、牛羊肉３０００公斤，４年后再向省厅运输局返回４万元。
    ６月１０日我市交通局运输处又与北票市哈尔脑乡淡水养殖场签定了另一份合同：运输处向养殖场投资１６万元，养殖场每年给运输处无偿提供鸡１３００公斤、蛋２５００公斤、牛羊肉３５００公斤，连续提供４年后，再向运输处返回４万元。值得指出的是，这个养殖场的承包人是我市交通局运输处处长的哥哥。
    合同签定后，市局运输处已将１６万元公款交给了北票市哈尔脑乡淡水养殖场。这个养殖场根本无鸡鸭牛羊，向上提供的物资全是买来的。
    两张合同，可谓三全其美：上悦领导，中饱私囊，下润手足。
    把公款转入个人之手，再变为餐桌上的美味，我认为，这是变相侵吞国家资财的行为，应当严肃处理。 　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　辽宁朝阳市　民之声答复
    经查，读者来信反映的问题基本属实。
    １９８８年８月，朝阳市交通局运输处向省运输局提供了２０００公斤鸡蛋，每人分得２５公斤，交款３０元。１９８８年９月，省运输局根据上级要求，对这起违反财经纪律的错误，做了纠正，终止协议，原投放的１６万元已全部收回。省运输局领导人在全体职工大会上做了检查，并向省交通厅做了检查。省交通厅因监督不力，表示负有领导责任，同时向省监察厅写了书面报告。
