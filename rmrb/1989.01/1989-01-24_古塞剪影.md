	The general's thoughts scatter
	Into a sky of faint blue stars
	White horses bearing swords and spears
	Pass through the red willows everywhere
	Those thoughts flow like an iron river
	Flowing for ten thousand years, speaking only of loyalty
	Speaking only of the setting sun on the watchtower
		The reflection of a clean and honest age
	War is a bleeding affair
	Rolling with tipsy people
	Shooting an arrow that echoes through the autumn mountains
	The wind blows over the wildflowers, carrying the general's clean sleeves
	The jingling of horse bells resonates in the distance
	The new moon is like the general's icy heart
	His banner holds the history of poverty
	Burning with great plumes of smoke and the howling plains

专栏：

　　古塞剪影
    王中朝
    大将的思绪碎成
    一天淡蓝的星星
    白马驮着刀枪
    打从遍地的红柳走过
    那思绪流成铁砌的河
    流成一万年只述忠贞
    只述戍楼落日和
    　廉洁岁月的倒影
    征战是流血的
    卷着微醉的人儿
    射一支响透秋山的箭
    野花上吹过将军的两袖清风
    叮当的马铃在天边悠响
    新月如将军的冰心
    他帅旗里是贫苦的历史
    燃着大朵烽烟和嘶鸣的草原
