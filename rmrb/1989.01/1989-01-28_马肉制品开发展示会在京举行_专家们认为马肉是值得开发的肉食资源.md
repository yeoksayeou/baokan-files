For thousands of years, horses have primarily been used for riding and pulling, and most regions in China do not have the habit of eating horse meat. The horse meat product development exhibition held in Beijing on January 26, jointly organized by the Inner Mongolia Dong Ujimqin Banner, the China Meat Products Comprehensive Research Center, and the China Industrial and Commercial Economic Consulting Company, showed that horse meat will become another important source of meat with broad development prospects for the Chinese people.

Attendees viewed 16 kinds of horse meat products, including braised horse meat, large sausages, tea sausages, Cantonese flavored sausages, ham, and green bean Lyon, and tasted 6 of these products. They unanimously praised: "It's really fragrant! It's almost as good as beef. There's no sour taste at all."

China is the country with the most horses in the world, with over 11 million horses of various kinds. With the development of mechanization, the demand for draft horses and military horses is decreasing day by day. For the four major pastoral areas of Inner Mongolia, Xinjiang, Qinghai, and Gansu, which have over 4 million horses, horses consume more grass compared to cattle and sheep, but their economic value is decreasing. The former wealth has become a burden. The comprehensive development and utilization of horse meat and other horse products have opened up a new path for the commercialization of horses in pastoral areas.

According to relevant experts, compared to pork, beef, and mutton, horse meat has a higher protein content, less fat, and better health benefits, making it a valuable meat source worth developing.

　　马肉制品开发展示会在京举行    
    专家们认为马肉是值得开发的肉食资源
    本报讯  数千年来，马匹主要供骑乘、挽用，我国多数地区没有吃马肉的习惯。１月２６日由内蒙古东乌珠穆沁旗、中国肉类食品综合研究中心和中国工商经济咨询公司在京联合举办的马肉制品开发展示会，向人们表明，马肉将成为我国人民肉食的又一个有广阔发展前景的重要来源。
    与会者参观了精工制做的酱马肉、大腊肠、茶肠、广式香肠、火腿肉、青豆里昂等１６种马肉制品，并且品尝了其中的６种制品，交口称赞：“真香！和牛肉差不多。一点儿也吃不出酸味儿。”
    我国是世界上养马最多的国家，拥有各种马匹１１００多万匹。随着机械化事业的发展，对耕马、军马的需求量日益减少。对拥有４００多万马匹的内蒙古、新疆、青海、甘肃４大牧区来说，马匹和牛、羊相比，消耗草量大而经济价值却越来越低，昔日的财富变成了包袱。马肉及其它马产品的综合开发利用，为牧区马匹的商品化开拓了新的出路。
    据有关专家介绍，同猪肉、牛肉、羊肉相比，马肉的蛋白质含量高，脂肪少，保健作用较好，是值得开发的肉食来源。
