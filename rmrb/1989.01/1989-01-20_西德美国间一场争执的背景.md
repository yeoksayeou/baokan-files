Lately, a verbal dispute between the United States and West Germany over a controversial chemical plant in Libya has attracted international attention.

The crux of the dispute between West Germany and the United States is whether Libya's chemical plant is a chemical weapons factory and whether West Germany has exported materials for producing chemical weapons to it. The United States and West Germany are allies and could have reached a consensus through internal intelligence sharing and coordinated investigations. However, the United States bypassed diplomatic channels, and its media used terms like "Auschwitz concentration camp" and "greed" to criticize West Germany, which is highly unusual. Local newspapers analyze that the dispute between West Germany and the United States has deeper backgrounds.

Firstly, West Germany and the United States have differing policies towards Libya. West Germany has expressed that it should encourage Libya's trend of approaching the West; the United States, however, views Libya as a thorn in its side and wants to eliminate it. In actions, although the United States is hostile towards Libya, West Germany maintains trade relations with it. According to newspaper reports, West Germany has never included Libya in its embargo list. After the United States shot down a Libyan plane in the Mediterranean, the West German Minister of Education was planning to visit Libya. When Libya proposed that the international community inspect the plant, the United States immediately rejected it, but West German Foreign Minister Genscher expressed support. Therefore, the United States broke its agreement with West Germany last November to conduct a confidential investigation and made the dispute public, reflecting the United States' frustration with West Germany's attitude towards Libya.

Secondly, it involves the Soviet Union, Eastern European countries, and some Third World countries. The New York Times quoted a senior official as saying that this incident relates to a "long-standing issue" in the relationship between West Germany and the United States regarding West Germany's exports to Eastern Europe and the Third World. The U.S. government has made at least 15 diplomatic protests to West Germany in the past two years. The newspaper also revealed that U.S. intelligence agencies have long asserted that "most technological thieves come from West Germany." Additionally, West Germany has repeatedly argued for easing the embargo within the CoCom with the United States. Therefore, the United States is more dissatisfied with West Germany's trade relations with the Soviet Union and Eastern European countries. From this perspective, the chemical plant incident is just an opportunity to hit West Germany.

Furthermore, the United States is concerned about West Germany's so-called "neutralization" trend. The editorial of the Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung says that West Germany believes that U.S. policies are too changeable and difficult to adapt to; while the United States believes that West Germany and even Western Europe have serious "self-interest." Recent disagreements between the two include West Germany's refusal to extradite terrorist suspects to the United States, repeated avoidance of taking a stance on the short-range missile issue in Europe, and complaints about NATO air force low-altitude training in West Germany. Some even discuss the "occupying army characteristics" of U.S. forces, complaining that West Germany "lacks sovereignty," and so on. Especially in recent years, West Germany's attitude towards the Soviet Union and Eastern European countries has been warm, and the United States' distrust of West Germany has become more serious. Using the issue of the Libyan chemical plant to attack West Germany, this saying is probably not groundless.

Local public opinion believes that the dispute between the United States and West Germany over the Libyan plant incident reflects many disagreements between the two sides and to some extent reflects the relationship between Europe and the United States. A West German official called on the German and American sides to "look at the world more from each other's perspectives and thoughts" in the Welt am Sonntag on the 16th. However, this is precisely the most difficult thing to achieve.

　　西德美国间一场争执的背景
    本报记者  江建国
    最近一段时间，美国与西德围绕利比亚一座有争议的化工厂而展开的唇枪舌战，引起了国际社会的注目。
    西德和美国这场争执的症结是，利比亚的这个工厂是否化学武器工厂？西德是否向它出口了生产化学武器的物资？美国和西德是盟友，本来可以通过内部交换情报和配合调查而取得一致。然而，美国却绕开外交渠道，它的新闻界则用“奥斯威辛集中营”、“见利忘义”这样的字眼指责西德，这就显得极不寻常了。此间报刊分析认为，西德同美国的这场争执有着更深的背景。
    首先，西德和美国在对待利比亚的政策上有分歧。西德曾经表示，应该鼓励利比亚已经出现的与西方接近的趋势；美国则视利比亚为眼中钉，必欲除之而后快。在行动上，虽然美国敌视利比亚，西德却同它保持贸易往来，据报刊透露，西德从未把利比亚列入它的禁运名单。美国在地中海上空击落利比亚飞机之后，西德教育部长正打算去利比亚访问。利比亚提出由国际社会视察该工厂，美国立即拒绝，西德外长根舍却表示支持。所以，美国打破它去年１１月与西德商定的保密调查的约定，将分歧公开，反映了美国对西德在对待利比亚态度问题上感到恼火。
    其次，涉及到苏联东欧国家和某些第三世界国家。《纽约时报》援引一个高级官员的话说，这个事件关系到西德与美国关系中一个“经年历久的问题”，关于西德对东欧和第三世界的出口，美国政府过去两年至少向西德提出过１５次外交抗议。这家报纸还透露，美国情报机关早就断言“大多数技术强盗出自西德”。另外，西德在巴统内一再为放松禁运与美国争辩。所以美国对西德与苏联东欧国家的经贸关系更为不满。由此看来，化工厂事件只是能打痛西德的一个机缘。
    还有，美国担心西德的所谓“中立化”倾向。《法兰克福汇报》的社论说，西德认为美国政策多变，难以适从；而美国则认为西德乃至西欧“利己主义”严重。双方近期出现的分歧有：西德拒绝向美国引渡恐怖嫌疑分子、一再回避在欧洲短导问题上表态、对北约空军在西德的低飞训练啧有烦言，有人甚至议论美军有“占领军特点”，抱怨西德“缺少主权”等等。尤其是西德近几年来对苏联和东欧国家态度热情，美国对西德的不信任情绪更加严重，利用利比亚化工厂问题向西德发难，恐怕此说也不是空穴来风。
    此间舆论认为，美国与西德围绕利比亚工厂事件的争执是双方之间存在许多分歧的一种反映，也从一定程度上反映了欧美关系。西德一位负责官员１６日在《世界报》上呼吁德美双方“多用对方的眼光和思想去看世界”。但是，这一点恰恰是最难做到的。
