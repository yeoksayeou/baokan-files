The supervisory departments delay in resolving enterprise difficulties: Root River Artificial Board Factory completed but not in operation

	The Root River Artificial Board Factory, a state-level "Seventh Five-Year Plan" large and medium-sized construction project, invested over 60 million yuan in importing particleboard production equipment. The installation was completed nearly a year ago, but due to the lack of coordinated raw material planning by the supervisory departments, it has not been able to pass inspection and start production, resulting in idle equipment and over a thousand workers waiting for work within the factory.

	The Root River Artificial Board Factory is a project approved by the State Planning Commission and the Ministry of Forestry in 1984 and 1985. In the Da Xing'anling forest area, every year a large amount of wood waste remains after logging. Utilizing these waste materials to produce artificial boards can alleviate the tension in wood supply and reduce the country's need to import boards and plywood. Therefore, relevant departments decided to build the Root River Artificial Board Factory.

	It is reported that the main reason why the factory's chemical raw materials have not been resolved is that the supervisory department, the Ministry of Forestry, has not included the factory's raw material supply in the plan. The factory reported the detailed situation to the Ministry of Forestry's material department in 1987, but there was no solution to the problem. The factory directly sent an urgent report to the Ministry of Forestry, requesting that the required chemical raw materials be included in the Ministry of Forestry's planned supply channel, but more than a year and a half has passed with no response. Since the factory is directly supplied by the Ministry of Forestry, the local government does not provide a solution. Last year, the factory tried to solve the problem on its own, but due to the lack of production and supply information, it was unsuccessful.

	The factory's staff said: The state's planned construction of key projects, the supervisory departments do not make relevant coordinated plans, dragging it on really makes it difficult for the enterprise.

### 主管部门迟迟不为企业解难  根河人造板厂建成未能投产

　　主管部门迟迟不为企业解难
    根河人造板厂建成未能投产
    本报讯  国家“七五”大中型建设项目之一的内蒙古根河林业局人造板厂花了６０００多万元引进的刨花板生产设备，安装完工近一年，因主管部门缺乏配套原料计划安排，至今无法验收和投产，致使设备闲置，千余工人厂内待工。
    根河人造板厂是国家计委、林业部１９８４、１９８５年批准兴建的项目。在大兴安岭林区，每年砍伐后剩余的木材废弃惊人，而利用这些废木材制成人造板，既可以缓和木材供应紧张矛盾，又可使国家减少进口板材和三合板。为此，有关部门决定兴建根河人造板厂。
    据介绍，该厂化工原料没有解决的重要原因，是主管部门林业部没有将该厂的原料供应列入计划。该厂在１９８７年就向林业部物资部门作了详细汇报，但没有解决问题的答复。该厂直接向林业部打紧急报告，要求将所需的化工原料纳入林业部计划供应渠道，但事过一年半之久仍无音讯。由于该厂是林业部直供单位，地方政府也不予解决。去年该厂想办法自行解决，因产供信息不通，也无结果。
    该厂同志说：国家计划建设的重点项目，主管部门不做有关配套的计划安排，拖下去实在让企业为难。
