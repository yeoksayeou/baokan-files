The masses in Shenzhen have developed the habit of reporting cases of embezzlement and bribery to the city's economic crime reporting center. This has become a common practice in the special economic zone.

In the bustling commercial economy of Shenzhen, some cadres have succumbed to the temptations of money and women, leading to their downfall. According to statistics from the Shenzhen Economic Crime Reporting Center over the past nine months, 1,137 individuals have been reported by the masses for suspected involvement in crimes, including 166 party and government officials and 352 enterprise managers, directors, and secretaries.

Local prosecutors have utilized 242 leads from reports to handle cases, recovering a total of 503,800 yuan and 185,000 Hong Kong dollars in illicit funds. Additionally, they have helped the state recover economic losses amounting to 9,767,600 yuan and 247,600 Hong Kong dollars.

The masses have reported various suspected cases through letters, phone calls, and face-to-face meetings, totaling 1,022 cases. Local prosecutors have directly handled over 730 of these cases, with only 7 being found to be unfounded.

Through these reports, local prosecutors have initiated investigations, punished a batch of embezzlement and bribery criminals, and played a positive role in rectifying the economic environment of the Shenzhen Special Economic Zone, saving cadres in the process. However, the masses in Shenzhen are calling on the party and government's supervisory departments to take more effective measures to achieve the goal of clean government, especially in dealing with tough issues, to dare to break through various obstacles and create a new atmosphere in the special economic zone.

　　群众敢斗邪恶　廉政就有希望
    深圳利用举报线索重创腐败行为
    本报深圳电  记者王楚报道：发现贪污、受贿情况，就到市经济罪案举报中心去举报。这已逐步成为深圳特区群众的习惯。
    商品经济十分活跃的深圳特区，近年来有些干部经不起金钱、美女的诱惑，中“弹”落马。仅从深圳市经济举报中心近９个月的累计数字看，被群众举报的涉嫌人员就有１１３７人，其中党政干部１６６人，企业单位厂长、经理、书记３５２人。
    此间一个新闻媒介统计了当地检察机关利用举报线索查处的２４２件案件，共追回赃款５０．３８万元人民币和１８．５万元港币，同时为国家挽回经济损失９７６．７６万元人民币和２４．７６万元港币。
    群众以信函、电话、面谈等方式举报各类涉嫌线索１０２２件，当地检察机关直接处理７３０多件，其中失实的只有７件。
    通过举报线索，当地检察机关立案侦查，查处惩治一批贪污受贿的犯罪人员，为治理深圳特区经济环境，起到良好作用，挽救了干部。但是，如何加快实现廉政目标，深圳群众呼唤党和政府的监督部门，拿出更有力的措施来，特别是在“碰硬”的问题上，敢于冲破各种阻力，形成特区新气象。
