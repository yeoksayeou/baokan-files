Revitalize the Spirit, Actively Strive Forward, Take New Steps
Full Military Logistics Work Conference Concludes

Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, January 13th — “Living frugally does not mean passively waiting and doing nothing; rather, it means revitalizing the spirit, actively striving forward, ensuring the life and emergency needs of the troops, and striving to improve combat effectiveness.” This is the common understanding and resolve of the comrades attending the Full Military Logistics Work Conference.

The 7-day Full Military Logistics Work Conference concluded successfully today. This conference thoroughly studied and implemented the spirit of the Thirteenth Central Committee’s Third Plenary Session and the Central Military Commission’s directives on military work. It discussed and researched major issues in logistics work and construction, unified thoughts, clarified tasks, and inspired fighting spirit.

In his summary speech, Liu Anyuan, Political Commissar of the General Logistics Department, pointed out that the attendees have a clear understanding and correct attitude towards living frugally, demonstrating a high level of awareness. Each unit faces many difficulties, but everyone does not complain and does not ask for help. Instead, they actively seek solutions within themselves and overcome difficulties. Many comrades expressed that they will turn the pressure of insufficient military funds into a driving force for scientific management and hard work, paving a new path for high-efficiency logistics work with low consumption.

Liu Anyuan said that to do a good job in logistics work in the new era, one must not only have a good spiritual state but also have excellent leadership style. Currently, maintaining integrity and honesty is an important issue. Logistics manage money and materials, serving the troops, and logistics personnel at all levels must not take advantage of this to seek personal gain. Especially high and middle-level leaders and leading organs, must do this. This conference proposed to establish professional ethics, with integrity as a key point, led by leaders to implement.

Liu Anyuan demanded that the spirit of selfless dedication be vigorously promoted in the logistics front. He said, logistics is responsible for service work, which is complex and laborious, and many logistics grassroots units have harsh environments. The dedication of the broad masses of soldiers and workers in the logistics front is difficult to measure with material standards. Currently, it is necessary to combine situation education with patriotism education, the purpose of the People’s Liberation Army serving the people wholeheartedly, and ideal and moral education, to make the broad logistics personnel firmly establish the idea of not seeking personal fame and gain, working hard for national defense, and selfless dedication. United in mind and deed, to take new steps in the logistics work of the entire army.

　　振奋精神　积极进取　迈出新步伐
    全军后勤工作会议结束
    新华社北京１月１３日电  （记者郭殿成）“过紧日子不是消极等待，无所作为，而是要振奋精神，积极进取，确保部队生活和战备急需，努力提高战斗力。”这是出席全军后勤工作会议的同志的共同认识和决心。
    历时７天的全军后勤工作会议今天圆满结束。这次会议认真学习贯彻党的十三届三中全会精神和中央军委关于军队工作的指示，讨论研究了后勤工作和建设中的一些重大问题，统一了思想，明确了任务，激励了斗志。
    总后勤部政委刘安元在会议总结中指出，与会同志对过紧日子这个问题认识明确，态度端正，表现了很高的觉悟。本来每个单位都有很多困难，但是，大家不叫苦，不伸手，积极从自身想办法，克服困难。许多同志表示，要把军费紧缺这个压力，自觉地变成促进科学管理、艰苦奋斗的动力，走出一条低耗高效的后勤工作的新路子。
    刘安元说，做好新时期的后勤工作，不仅要有良好的精神状态，而且要有优良的领导作风。当前，保持清正廉洁就是一个重要的问题。后勤管钱管物，是为部队服务的，各级后勤干部决不能借机为自己谋私利。尤其是高中级领导干部和领导机关，更要做到这一点。这次会议提出，要订出职业道德准则，其中要把廉洁问题作为一个重点，由领导带头实施。
    刘安元要求在后勤战线大力提倡无私奉献的精神。他说，后勤担负的是服务性工作，繁杂琐细，辛勤劳累，还有许多后勤基层单位环境艰苦。后勤战线广大官兵和职工的奉献，难以用物质的尺度计量。当前，要把形势教育同爱国主义教育、我军全心全意为人民服务宗旨的教育、理想、道德教育结合起来，使广大后勤人员牢固树立不计个人名利，为国防事业埋头苦干，无私奉献的思想，同心同德，使全军后勤工作迈出新步伐。
