	Jaruzelski Proposes Four Prerequisites for Trade Union Pluralism
	● Ensure Social Stability
	● Safeguard the Stability of the Socialist Homeland
	● Promote the Smooth Progress of Reforms
	● Facilitate Class Unity

	Xinhua News Agency, Warsaw, January 25 – On the 24th, the First Secretary of the Central Committee of the Polish United Workers' Party, Jaruzelski, emphasized that in Poland, the implementation of trade union pluralism must "fulfill the four prerequisites of ensuring social stability, etc."

	This Polish leader visited the Blowczek City Oil Refinery and Petrochemical Complex on the 24th. The 10th Plenary Session of the Central Committee of the Polish United Workers' Party made a decision on political and trade union pluralism, and he went to the factory to explain this decision and listen to opinions. Today's Polish newspapers published Jaruzelski's speech during the visit.

	Jaruzelski pointed out that the four prerequisites for implementing trade union pluralism are:

	First, to ensure social stability, because this is something very precious to every Polish family and all the Polish people.

	Second, to safeguard the stability of the socialist homeland, because this is a result achieved by the Polish people at great cost.

	Third, to promote the smooth progress of reforms, because only by continuing reforms can the Polish people get out of the predicament.

	Fourth, to be conducive to the political unity of the working class, and it is not allowed to have conflicts and political struggles in the factories.

	Jaruzelski said that the 10th Plenary Session of the Polish United Workers' Party has clearly made a resolution on the issue of trade union pluralism. He hopes that the Polish working class will show "wisdom, patriotism, and a high sense of responsibility" on this major issue.

　　雅鲁泽尔斯基提出工会多元化四前提    
    ●保证社会安定　●保障祖国稳定   
    ●促进改革进程　●利于团结一致
    新华社华沙１月２５日电  波兰统一工人党中央第一书记雅鲁泽尔斯基２４日强调说，在波兰实行工会多元化必须“履行关于保证社会安定等四个前提”。
    这位波兰领导人２４日视察了布沃茨克市炼油和石油化工总厂。波兰统一工人党十中全会作出了关于实行政治和工会多元化的决定，他到工厂是为了解释这一决定并听取意见。波兰各报今天刊登了雅鲁泽尔斯基视察时的讲话。
    雅鲁泽尔斯基指出，实行工会多元化的四个前提是：
    第一，保证社会安定，因为这是每个波兰家庭和全体波兰人民非常珍贵的东西。
    第二，保障社会主义祖国的稳定，因为这是波兰人民付出重大代价获得的成果。
    第三，促进改革的顺利进行，因为波兰人民只有继续进行改革，才能摆脱困境。
    第四，有利于工人阶级政治上的团结一致，不能允许在工厂中出现冲突和进行政治斗争。
    雅鲁泽尔斯基说，波党十中全会已明确地就工会多元化问题作出了决议。他希望波兰工人阶级在这一重大问题上“表现出智慧、爱国主义和高度的责任感”。
