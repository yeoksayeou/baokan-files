A large group of angiosperm fossils has been discovered in Hubei, revealing that the climate of the middle and lower reaches of the Yangtze River 2.5 million years ago was tropical to subtropical.

Xinhua News Agency, Wuhan, January 13th — (Reporter Luo Hui) Professor Qi Guofan and four others from Hubei University have discovered a large group of angiosperm fossils in Xinzhou County, Wuhan City.

Qi Guofan said that he accidentally discovered wood fossils that farmers had discarded while digging the ground. With the help of his assistants, he spent several years excavating and studying, eventually discovering that the area around Xiangluo Incense Burner Mountain is widely distributed with fossils of more than 70 species of angiosperms, including maples, laurel, and legumes. This is the first time Chinese scholars have discovered angiosperm fossils.

Since October 1984, Qi Guofan and others, with the cooperation of relevant departments, have excavated and collected a total of approximately 2 tons of angiosperm fossils. Among these fossils, many have complete tree shapes, clear textures, bright colors, and yellow and white stripes, allowing experts to easily determine the tree's age. The longest tree measured is 9 meters, with the largest diameter being 80 centimeters. These fossils are determined to be from the late Tertiary period, dating back 25 to 20 million years.

After carefully studying the existing angiosperm fossils, experts have revealed the climate of the middle and lower reaches of the Yangtze River 2.5 million years ago: compared to modern times, the average annual temperature was about 5 degrees Celsius higher, and the annual rainfall was about 800 millimeters more, making it a tropical to subtropical climate.

　　湖北发现大型被子植物化石群
    长江中下游２５０万年前属热带——亚热带气候
    新华社武汉１月１３日电  （记者罗辉）湖北大学齐国凡副教授等４人在武汉市新洲县阳逻镇发现大型被子植物化石群。
    齐国凡说，他偶尔发现农民挖地时甩在一边的木材化石后，在助手帮助下，他历经数年艰苦发掘研究，终于发现阳逻香炉山一带，广泛分布着秋枫、樟科、豆科等７０余种被子植物化石，这也是我国学者首次发现被子植物化石。
    从１９８４年１０月以来，齐国凡等在有关部门配合下，挖掘搜集了总重量约２吨的被子植物化石，这些化石中，有不少树形完整、纹理清晰、色泽鲜明、黄白相间，行家可一眼看出树龄。其中最长一棵为９米，直径最大为８０厘米。据测定，这些化石属地质年代晚第三纪，距今２５０万年—２０００万年。
    有关专家对现有被子植物化石精心研究后，揭开了距今２５０万年前长江中下游气候的面纱：与现代比，年平均气温高５摄氏度左右，年降雨量多８００毫米左右，属热带——亚热带气候。
