Mexicans
(Part Three): Customs

By Guo Weicheng, People's Daily Correspondent

American cowboys are famous worldwide. However, the predecessors of cowboys were Mexicans. This is because the homeland of cowboys, the magical region from Texas to California, was originally Mexican territory. Even today, it is perhaps only in Mexico that one can see "vaqueros" (cowboys) dressed as depicted in novels and films. They are simply called "charro knights" in Mexico. Although the current President Salinas is known for his extensive knowledge and has obtained three Ph.D. degrees from Harvard University in the United States, he was also an excellent rider during his student days. In addition to charros, Mexicans are also very fond of classical Spanish-style bullfighting and mariachi folk music. The former embodies the spirit of wit and bravery; the latter reflects the exuberance and passion of this nation. Charros, bullfighting, and mariachi music are considered the quintessence of Mexico. These three performances are indispensable for any festive occasion.

It is difficult to accurately count the number of festivals Mexicans celebrate throughout the year. From major events like Independence Day, the Virgin Mary's Day, and Christmas, to smaller ones like Carnival and the Day of the Dead; from harvest festivals like the Corn Festival, Cotton Festival, Potato Festival, and Tuna (prickly pear fruit) Festival, to product exchange and observation events like the Silverware Festival, Guitar Festival, and Tequila Festival, these festivals last from one day to ten days or even half a month.

It can be said that in a year of 365 days, there is always a part of the population celebrating a festival. This includes family events such as birthdays and the 12th birthday celebration for girls, and even gatherings of friends and relatives, which Mexicans also call festivals.

Among the many festivals celebrated by Mexicans, there are both ancient Aztec traditions and Spanish influences. Every October 12th, the day Columbus arrived in the Americas, is called "Race Day" in Mexico and is a national celebration. Some people refer to it as the birthday of the Mexican nation. As for the Day of the Dead each year, it is more of an Aztec custom. People honor the deceased, but there is no sadness; instead, they sing and dance all night long, intending to celebrate the festival with their deceased relatives. In the Aztec belief, death is the destination of life and also the beginning of new life. Therefore, they joyfully celebrate the completion of the life cycle and welcome the reunion of the living and the dead once a year. The ancient Indian sacrifices also become folk festivals. In the early summer, the Sun Festival is celebrated with singing and dancing, mimicking ancient customs by offering the heart of a young person to the Sun God. The Indians believed that this is how the Sun gains eternal vitality. I saw a dance called "Awakening of Spring," which tells the story of the Aztecs sacrificing a young girl to bring spring, expressing a nation's strong pursuit of the future.

When visiting the ancient town of Uman, which leads to the Caribbean Sea, Mexicans fully express their generosity, exuberance, and passion. The two-week-long August Festival is a tradition of the people of Uman, which has been passed down for 115 years since the last century. During the festival, the town is dressed in its finest, attracting merchants from far and wide to join in the festivities. In the city, cockfights take place in the arena; outside the city, bullfights determine the winner. There are also charro horse races, beauty pageants, and competitions for the best livestock. The beauty queen of Uman must be a good rider; when crowned, she is given a wide-brimmed charro hat. On August 15th, during the Assumption of Mary Festival in Uman, people use flowers and colorful wood shavings to create patterned "carpets" on the main streets of the town to welcome the midnight procession of the Virgin Mary. At that time, bells ring, fireworks light up the sky; the beautifully dressed statue of the Virgin Mary is placed in a gilded shrine and parades through the colorful streets. The entire city rejoices until dawn. Similar folk activities to the August Festival in Uman can be found in various places. Mexicans jokingly say, "Too many festivals have made us lazy." It is unclear whether this nation created such customs or whether these customs shaped this nation. However, folk customs have influenced generation after generation of Mexicans, making them a bold, passionate, and optimistic nation.

　　墨西哥人
    （三）习俗篇
    本报记者  郭伟成
    美国西部牛仔举世闻名。但是，牛仔的前辈是墨西哥人。因为牛仔的故乡、充满神奇色彩的得克萨斯到加利福尼亚的广大西部地区，原本是墨西哥人的故乡。时至今日，恐怕只有在墨西哥才能看到小说与电影中那样打扮的“瓦盖罗”（牛仔）了。只不过，在墨西哥叫做“恰罗骑士”。现总统萨利纳斯虽然以其满腹才学，三次拿到美国哈佛大学的博士学位，但是，学生时代也是一名出色的骑手。除此之外，墨西哥人还十分热衷于古典的西班牙式斗牛和玛利雅奇民间音乐。前者体现着机智和勇武的精神；后者表现着这个民族的奔放与热情。恰罗、斗牛和玛利雅奇音乐堪称是墨西哥的国粹。凡节日喜庆，都少不了这三项表演。
    要准确统计墨西哥人一年到头的节日，恐怕是很难的。大到独立节、圣母节、圣诞节；小至狂欢节、鬼节；收获时的玉米节、棉花节、土豆节、图纳（仙人掌果）节；以产品交流观摩为目的的银器节、吉他节、特吉拉酒节等等，少则一日，多则持续十天半个月。
    可以说，一年３６５天，每天都有一部分人在过节。其中也少不了家庭性的，诸如生日、女孩１２岁成人日等，甚至亲朋好友相聚，墨西哥人皆称之为节日。
    在墨西哥人的众多节日中，既有古代阿兹特克人的遗风，也有西班牙人的影响。每年１０月１２日哥伦布到达美洲这一天，在墨西哥叫做“种族日”，也是全民庆贺的节日，有人称之为墨西哥民族的生日。至于每年的鬼节（亡灵节），大约更多的是阿兹特克人的习俗了。人们祭奠亡灵，却绝无悲哀，甚至载歌载舞，通宵达旦，意在与死去的亲人一起欢度节日。在阿兹特克人的观念中，死是生命的归宿，也是新生命的开始，因此，他们欢欣鼓舞地庆祝生命周期的完成，一年一度迎接生者与死者的团聚。古代印第安人的祭祀，也成为民间节日。初夏的太阳祭，人们欢歌曼舞，模仿古代的习俗，将少年的心“掏”出来献给太阳神。印第安人认为，太阳是这样获得永恒的活力。我看过一个叫做“春天的苏醒”的舞蹈，叙述阿兹特克人以少女的牺牲换取春天，表现出一个民族对未来的强烈追求。
    来到古代通往加勒比海的小镇乌曼特拉时，墨西哥民族会把他们的豪爽、奔放与热情表现得淋漓尽致。前后两周的八月节，是乌曼特拉人的传统，从上一个世纪开始，代代延续，已有１１５年之久。节日期间，小镇换上了盛装，吸引了远近商贩，赶集助兴。城里，斗鸡场上，雄鸡角逐；城外，斗牛场上，一决高下。还有恰罗骑手的赛马，选美，以至评比优良牲畜。乌曼特拉选出的美女，必须善骑；为美女加冕时，给戴上恰罗的宽边大圆帽。到８月１５日乌曼特拉的亚松森圣母节那一天，人们用鲜花，五彩的木屑，把镇上主要街道铺上各式图案的“地毯”，迎接午夜时的圣母出游。其时，钟声齐鸣，礼花缤纷；盛装的圣母塑像，供在镀金的神龛里，从五彩路上走过。全城人尽情狂欢，及至黎明。类似乌曼特拉八月节的民间活动在各地都有。墨西哥人自嘲地说：“太多的节日把我们养懒了。”分不清是这个民族造成了这样的习俗，还是这习俗养成了这样的民族。”但是，民间习俗熏陶了世世代代的墨西哥人，使他们成为这样一个豪放、热情、乐观的民族。
