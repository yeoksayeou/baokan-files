Comprehensive market product inspections have been launched in ten major cities. The inspections, organized by the State Bureau of Technical Supervision, have already begun in various cities, with inspection teams from the bureau working alongside local authorities to conduct random checks on products.

Given the increased market activity leading up to the Spring Festival, the inspections focus on five categories and nine types of products designated by the State Bureau of Technical Supervision: white liquor, colored liquor, grains and oils, canned goods, and electric blankets. Additionally, each city's technical supervision bureau has added other essential daily items based on local conditions. For example, Beijing has included pastries, ham sausages, and sausages; Shenyang has added vinegar, soy sauce, and pickled vegetables; Guangzhou has included laundry detergent.

Local leaders have shown great concern for this market product inspection work. In Xi'an, Vice Mayor Ma Zhenhua organized the Municipal Bureau of Standards and Metrology, the Bureau of Industry and Commerce, the Consumer Association, and the Users' Committee to form a joint inspection team, ensuring that the quality inspection work proceeds smoothly and meticulously.

Preliminary inspections have revealed that a significant number of the sampled products have issues with counterfeiting and poor quality. Since the inspected products were taken from the market and counters, tracing responsibility can be challenging. Leaders from the State Bureau of Technical Supervision have instructed the technical supervision bureaus in each city to work with the Bureau of Industry and Commerce and other departments to make the findings public, pursue accountability, and handle serious cases accordingly.

　　十大城市商品检查全面展开
　　不少商品存在伪劣问题
    新华社北京１月１７日电  （记者姜在忠）经国家技术监督局组织的十大城市市场商品质量检查工作已全面推开。国家技术监督局派出的检查组已到各市，与当地有关部门一起开始抽检商品。
    根据春节前市场购销两旺的特点，除对国家技术监督局部署的白酒、色酒、粮油、罐头、电热毯５类９种商品进行质量检查外，各市技术监督局还根据当地情况，增加了其他生活必需品的质量检查。如北京增加了糕点、火腿肠、香肠；沈阳增加了醋、酱油、咸菜；广州增加了洗衣粉等。
    各地有关领导对这次市场商品检查工作十分重视。西安市副市长马振华组织市标准计量局、工商局、消费者协会、用户委员会等部门成立了联合检查组，保证了质检工作进行得顺利而又细致。
    初步检查表明，被抽查的商品中，相当一些存在伪冒和质量低劣问题。由于被检商品来自市场、柜台抽样，追踪责任者存在一定难度，国家技术监督局的领导要求各市技术监督局，会同工商等部门，对查出的问题一定要公诸于众，追究到底，并视情节严肃处理。
