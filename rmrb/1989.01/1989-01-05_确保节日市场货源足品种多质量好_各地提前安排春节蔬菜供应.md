With the Spring Festival just a month away, state-owned vegetable companies across the country have already made arrangements for the vegetable supply during the festival. According to the statistics from the Bureau of Subsidiary Foodstuffs under the Ministry of Commerce, 2.2 million carloads of fresh vegetables totaling 6.1 billion kilograms will be transported from the south to major and medium-sized cities in the north, representing a 20% increase compared to the same period last year. Beijing, Tianjin, Shanghai, Shenyang, Guangzhou, Xi'an, Changchun, Chongqing, Lanzhou, Xining, Chengdu, Wuhan, Nanjing, Zhengzhou, and Taiyuan, among other 20 major and medium-sized cities, have planned to supply 138.6 million kilograms of vegetables during the Spring Festival, maintaining the same level as the same period last year. On average, each person can have more than 300 grams of vegetables per day, with generally 20 different varieties. Beijing, Shanghai, and other cities will have more than 50 varieties of vegetables available in large markets.

The Spring Festival is the peak season for vegetable demand. Ensuring the production and supply of subsidiary foodstuffs, especially the vegetable supply in large cities during the festival, is a crucial factor in maintaining price stability. Governments at various levels attach great importance to this. Most cities have held special meetings to establish leading groups for the supply of subsidiary foodstuffs, analyze the production and sales situation during the festival, actively organize the supply of goods, and implement purchase and sales contracts. They have dispatched a large number of procurement personnel to other regions to purchase goods, increase the supply of popular and suitable varieties, and ensure that the market has an adequate supply of vegetables with diverse varieties and good quality during the festival.

Beijing has arranged to supply 20 million kilograms of vegetables for the Spring Festival this year, a 10.5% increase compared to the same period last year. The city will import 5.95 million kilograms from the south, a 12.3% increase compared to the same period last year. This includes 1.5 million kilograms of cauliflower, 1 million kilograms each of green peppers and celery, 500,000 kilograms each of tomatoes and cucumbers, and 800,000 kilograms of garlic shoots. Retail prices will remain basically the same as the same period last year.

In Guangzhou, there are more than 40 varieties of vegetables. To enrich the market during the festival, the city has specially arranged the production of more than 20 varieties of tofu products such as small bridge tofu and five-spice dried flowers. In Chongqing, vegetable production during the festival is transitioning from the off-season to the peak season, with a variety of vegetables coming to market. The supply in January and during the Spring Festival can reach 22 million kilograms, a 29.5% increase compared to the same period last year. They aim to import more vegetables before the festival to support northern cities. Cities like Xi'an will implement retail price controls on major vegetable varieties during the Spring Festival to stabilize prices.

　　确保节日市场货源足品种多质量好
    各地提前安排春节蔬菜供应
    本报北京１月４日讯  记者王锦鹄报道：离新春佳节还有一个月，各地国营蔬菜公司已提前做好春节蔬菜供应安排。据商业部副食品局统计，春节前后，将有２．２万个车皮６．１亿公斤的细菜从南方运到北方各大中城市，比去年同期分别增长２０％。北京、天津、上海、沈阳、广州、西安、长春、重庆、兰州、西宁、成都、武汉、南京、郑州、太原等２０个大中城市春节安排供应蔬菜１３８６０万公斤，与去年同期持平，平均每天每人可供蔬菜３００克以上，供应品种一般在２０个。北京、上海等城市大菜场供应品种可达５０多个。
    春节是蔬菜需求最旺的时节，做好节日副食品生产供应，特别是安排好大城市节日蔬菜供应，是保持物价稳定的重要因素。各地政府对此十分重视。多数城市为安排好节日蔬菜市场供应，召开专门会议，成立副食品供应领导小组，研究分析节日产销形势，积极组织货源，落实购销合同，派出大量采购人员到外埠采购，增加适销对路花色品种，确保节日市场蔬菜货源充足，品种多，质量好。
    北京市今年春节安排供应蔬菜２０００万公斤，比去年同期增长１０．５％；从南方调入５９５万公斤，比去年同期增长１２．３％，其中菜花１５０万公斤，青椒、芹菜各１００万公斤，西红柿、黄瓜各５０万公斤，蒜薹８０万公斤。零售价格基本维持去年同期水平。
    南方的广州市蔬菜品种有４０多种，为了丰富节日市场，还特地安排生产了小桥豆腐，五香花干等２０多个豆制品花色品种；重庆市节日期间蔬菜生产正值由淡季转入旺季，大路菜品种陆续登市，１月份及春节期间上市量可达２２００万公斤，比去年同期增长２９．５％。他们争取节前多外调些菜，支援北方城市。西安等城市为稳定菜价，将对春节蔬菜供应主要品种实行零售限价。
