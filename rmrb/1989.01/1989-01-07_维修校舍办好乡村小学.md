Your newspaper published an article titled "What Should Be Done About the Huazhuang Village Primary School in Huaxian County?" along with a set of photographs on the fifth page of the October 12, 1988 issue. The municipal committee leadership attached great importance to this and immediately instructed the Huaxian County Committee to conduct a thorough investigation. After the investigation, the issues were found to be largely true. The Ci Zhouzhuang Township government of Huaxian County promptly repaired two three-level dilapidated classrooms. The wages of the extra teachers have been resolved. The village plans to build a school with better conditions on the basis of raising 100,000 yuan in 1987, and will mobilize the masses to raise additional funds to strive to complete the construction before or after the Lunar New Year.

　　维修校舍办好乡村小学
    你报在１９８８年１０月１２日第五版刊登朱如民等人《滑县高庄村小学该怎么办》的文章和一组照片，市委领导对此非常重视，立即责成滑县县委认真查处。经过调查，问题基本属实。滑县慈周寨乡政府对两座三级危房教室及时进行了整修，计划外教师的工资已得到解决。这个村打算在１９８７年集资１万元的基础上，再发动群众适当集资，力争农历春节前后建成一所条件较好的学校。
