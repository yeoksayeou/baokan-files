	The People's Daily reports: Correspondent Lu Jichuan reports that Jiangsu Institute of Technology's Jingjiang Sandblasting Machine Factory has absorbed West German vacuum technology to develop the 2P-1 type vacuum pressure sandblasting machine.

	In industrial production, processes such as removing rust from metal materials, cleaning castings and weld seams, traditionally rely on manual chipping and chiseling, which are low in efficiency and cause severe pollution. Jiangsu Institute of Technology's Jingjiang Sandblasting Machine Factory has broken through the traditional principles of sandblasting and mechanical structures, integrating pressure sandblasting, vacuum recovery, and noise reduction and dust removal technologies. They have developed the 2P-1 type vacuum pressure sandblasting machine. This machine is used for rust removal on steel plates and various container surfaces, as well as for processing weld seams and castings. It increases efficiency by 15 times compared to manual operations, has low noise, and is pollution-free.

　　真空压力喷砂机高工效低噪音无污染
    本报讯  记者卢继传报道：江苏工学院靖江喷砂机厂吸收西德真空技术，研制成２Ｐ—１型真空压力喷砂机。
    在工业生产中，金属材料的除锈和去氧化铸件毛坯及焊缝脱渣等工序，靠手工铲、凿，工效低，污染严重。江苏工学院靖江喷砂机厂突破了传统的喷砂原理与机械结构，将压力喷砂、真空回收、消音除尘等技术集为一体，研制出２Ｐ—１型真空压力喷砂机。该机用于钢板表面和各类容器表面除锈、焊缝和铸件处理，比手工操作提高工效１５倍，噪音小，无污染。
