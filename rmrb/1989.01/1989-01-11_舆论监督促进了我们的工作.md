Public opinion supervision has promoted our work. In the past three years, Tai'an City has handled 24 cases exposed by newspapers and magazines. All three pieces of criticism and suggestions published by our newspaper last year have been resolved.

Since 1985, we have treated the handling of issues raised by the public in letters published in newspapers and magazines as an important task, forming a network of 342 full-time and part-time staff to handle these cases. Over the past three years, we have handled 24 cases exposed by higher-level newspapers and magazines, with a 100% resolution rate. Our main approaches are as follows:

1. **Prompt Handling.** For issues exposed in newspaper criticism articles, we take the initiative to handle them. Some cases are handled by filling out a newspaper criticism handling form, which is then signed by the responsible leader and forwarded to the relevant units for timely handling. In other cases, we dispatch personnel directly to handle the issues. From the time a criticism article is published to our response to the newspaper, it generally does not exceed one month. On June 25, 1988, your newspaper published the reader's letter and photos titled "Spring and Summer Without Water, Nine Dragons Village in Distress" on the fifth page. We immediately instructed the relevant departments to investigate and propose a treatment plan. We then purchased deep well submersible pumps, waterproof cables, compensators, and other equipment, drilled a deep well, and solved the drinking water problem for the villagers of Nine Dragons Village.

2. **Simultaneous Investigation and Rectification, Emphasizing Effectiveness.** On September 26, 1988, your newspaper published photos of gambling on Mount Tai. The public security authorities in the Mount Tai scenic area immediately took measures, apprehending 96 gamblers and imposing fines and confiscations totaling over 10,000 yuan.

3. **Quantitative Analysis, Providing Services.** Since 1987, your newspaper and other publications have raised some criticisms regarding the environmental sanitation, public order, and tourism services in Mount Tai. In addition to taking improvement measures, we have also reported this to the municipal Party committee and government leaders. The municipal leaders decided to launch the "Welcome Guests from All Over the World, Satisfaction in Mount Tai" campaign in Tai'an, which has achieved good results.

### 舆论监督促进了我们的工作

专栏：批评以后

　　舆论监督促进了我们的工作
    泰安市三年查处二十四件报刊披露的问题，本报去年的三件批评建议信稿都有了结果
    一九八五年以来，我们把查处报刊刊登群众来信提出的批评、建议，作为一项重要工作，并形成了一个由三百四十二名专职、兼职人员组成的查办网络。三年来，我们查处上级报刊批评稿披露的问题共二十四件，查结率为百分之一百。我们主要做法是：
    一、及时查办。对报刊批评稿件披露的问题，我们主动查处。有的填写报刊批评查办单，请主管负责同志签署意见后转有关单位限期查处；有的是我们直接派人查处。批评稿件从见报到我们回复报社，一般不超过一个月。一九八八年六月二十五日你报第五版刊登了《年年春夏苦无水，九龙村民心如焚》的读者来信和照片后，我们当即责成有关部门调查，提出了治理方案，随即购置深井潜水泵、防水电缆、补偿器等，打了一眼深井，解决了九龙村村民吃水难的问题。
    二、边查边改，讲究实效。一九八八年九月二十六日你报刊登了泰山出现赌博的照片后，泰山景区公安机关立即采取措施，共抓获赌徒九十六名，罚款、没收款一万多元。
    三、定量分析，提供服务。一九八七年以来，你报和其它一些报刊对泰山的环境卫生、治安秩序、旅游服务等提出了一些批评意见，我们除采取改进措施外，还向市委、市政府领导同志作了反映。市领导人决定在泰安开展“笑迎天下客，满意在泰山”的活动，收到较好的效果。
