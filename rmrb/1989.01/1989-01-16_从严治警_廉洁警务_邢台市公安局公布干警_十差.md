From strict law enforcement to clean policing, Xingtai City Public Security Bureau publishes "Ten Shortcomings" of officers

	From the People's Daily, we report: At a time when "Top Ten" selections and commendations are prevalent, the Public Security Bureau of Xingtai City, Hebei Province, issued a "red-headed document" at the beginning of the year, prominently publishing the "Ten Shortcomings" of its officers.

	In 1988, the Public Security Bureau of Xingtai City achieved significant results, with a crime rate reduction ranking at the top in the province. However, the leadership did not rest on their laurels. Instead, they compiled the shortcomings of their officers into the "Ten Shortcomings" and published the results to the public. Among the "Ten Shortcomings," some involved abuse of power, some neglect of duty, and others involved illegal behaviors.

	The leadership of Xingtai City Public Security Bureau believes that while selecting the "Top Ten" can indeed motivate excellence and promote positive spirit, publicizing the shortcomings of some individuals can have a more profound impact on them. Over the past year, they have combined law enforcement inspections with the evaluation of the "Ten Shortcomings" as an important measure for strict law enforcement and clean policing. Adhering to the principle of "facing society for open investigation and focusing on key problems," they have focused on public security, internal security, preliminary investigation, criminal investigation, traffic, and more than ten other departments to conduct self-inspections, joint inspections, and spot checks. By the end of the year, they had identified 14 aspects with 74 problems, and then evaluated the "Ten Shortcomings."

	The Public Security Bureau of Xingtai City has decided to continue this evaluation of the "Ten Shortcomings" as a regular practice in the future.

　　从严治警　廉洁警务
    邢台市公安局公布干警“十差”
    本报讯  在当前“十佳”迭出，表彰盛行的时候，河北省邢台市公安局却在年初发出“红头文件”，赫然公布了本局干警中的“十差”。
    １９８８年，邢台市公安局做出了很大成绩，发案率下降在全省名列前茅。但局领导人并没有满足，而是将本局干警的劣行集为“十差”，并将处理结果向社会公布。“十差”当中，有的滥用职权，有的玩忽职守，还有其他违法行为。
    邢台市公安局领导认为，评选“十佳”固然能激励先进弘扬正气，但对于有些人来说，公布其劣行更能使之受到触动。一年来，他们结合执法大检查，把划评“十差”作为从严治警、廉洁警务的一项重要措施，本着“面向社会公开查，突出问题重点查”的精神，着重在治安、内保、预审、刑警、交通等１０多个科、队开展自查、联查和抽查活动。年底共查出１４个方面的７４个问题，然后划评出“十差”。
    邢台市公安局决定今后要将划评“十差”活动作为制度坚持下去。
