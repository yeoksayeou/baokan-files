Various indications suggest that the decline in the dollar exchange rate may have reached its lowest point. In the coming period, if no sudden events occur, the dollar exchange rate is likely to fluctuate around its current level.

Looking back at the past year, the trend of dollar weakness has basically reversed. Although the dollar exchange rate experienced several declines throughout the year, by the end of the year, the exchange rate against the yen had risen by 3.5%, and against the West German Mark by 12.9%. At the start of the new year, despite an unfavorable opening on the foreign exchange market on the first trading day (January 3), the dollar soon rebounded. By January 6, the exchange rate against the yen rose to 126.75, and against the West German Mark to 1.81. It appears that the dollar exchange rate still has strong support.

Generally, there are three main factors influencing the fluctuation of the dollar exchange rate:

First, the fundamental economic factors. Over the past few years, the persistent high trade deficit has been a significant factor in the dollar's weakness. However, since last year, the growth of domestic demand in the United States has begun to slow down. Statistics show that the growth rate of U.S. domestic demand, after excluding inflation factors, has decreased from 3.7% in 1986 to 3% in 1987, and further to 1.5% in the first half of 1988. This has led to a reduction in imports. At the same time, with the enhanced competitiveness of U.S. industrial products, exports saw a rare increase of 30% last year, thereby significantly improving the trade deficit. The improvement in trade conditions helps stabilize the dollar exchange rate.

Additionally, with the U.S. economy approaching full employment (unemployment rate at 5.3%, capacity utilization rate above 84%), economic overheating increases the risk of inflation. If the dollar continues to depreciate, it will drive up import prices, which is contrary to the government's measures to control inflation.

Second, policy factors. The future Bush administration's dollar policy is not yet clear, but according to analyses by Western economists, the Bush administration does not want the dollar to depreciate significantly and advocates for "stability in the foreign exchange market." On the other hand, since last year, to prevent inflation from rising, major U.S. commercial banks have raised prime lending rates several times, reaching 10.5%, while the Federal Reserve's discount rate has remained unchanged since August last year. Given the current economic overheating, raising the Federal Reserve's discount rate is just a matter of time. If this happens, it will objectively promote a rebound in the dollar exchange rate.

Third, international factors. At last year's summit of the seven Western countries, although each country had its own economic considerations, they unanimously agreed that the dollar exchange rate should remain stable, otherwise it would be detrimental to the growth of the world economy. Moreover, the seven Western countries have reached a secret agreement to set limits on the fluctuation of the dollar exchange rate, and to intervene jointly in case of any risks, keeping the foreign exchange market under control.

Of course, fundamentally, the fluctuation of the dollar exchange rate is constrained by the extent to which the United States' enormous fiscal deficit improves. Since the incoming Bush administration has not yet presented a feasible plan to reduce the fiscal deficit, and solving the fiscal deficit will encounter numerous difficulties, the possibility of a significant rebound in the dollar exchange rate seems small.

### 美元汇价走势趋稳？

　　美元汇价走势趋稳？
    孙毅
    种种迹象似乎表明，美元汇价的下跌已近谷底，在今后一个时期内，若无突发性事件发生，美元汇价将在目前水平线上徘徊。
    从过去一年的情况来看，美元汇价的疲软颓势已基本扭转，这一年中美元汇率虽经历过几次下跌，但到年终对日元的汇价仍上升了３．５％，对西德马克的汇价上升了１２．９％。新年伊始，尽管美元汇价在外汇市场上的第一个交易日（３日）开市不利，但此后不久，美元又突然回升，到１月６日，１美元对日元比价上升到１２６．７５；对西德马克上升到１．８１。看来，美元汇率目前仍有较强的支持力量。
    一般来说，影响美元汇率变动有三个基本因素：
    第一，基本的经济因素。在过去几年中，居高难下的巨额外贸赤字一直是造成美元疲软的一个重要因素，但去年以来，美国国内需求增长开始缓慢，据统计，扣除通货膨胀因素后的美国国内需求增长率已从１９８６年的３．７％下降到１９８７年的３％，１９８８年上半年又下降到１．５％，这使进口有所减少。与此同时，随着美国工业产品竞争能力增强，去年出口出现了增长３０％的少有纪录，从而使贸易赤字有较大的改善。外贸形势的好转，有助于美元汇价的稳定。
    此外，由于美国经济已接近充分就业水平（失业率为５．３％，开工率达８４％以上），经济过热增加了通货膨胀的危险，如美元继续贬值，将使进口价格上升，与政府要求的缓和通货膨胀措施不利。
    第二，政策因素。未来的布什政府将采取何种美元政策目前尚不明朗，但据西方经济学界分析，布什政府并不希望美元大幅度下跌，而主张“外汇市场的稳定”。另一方面，自去年以来，为防止通货膨胀上升，美国大商业银行已几次调高优惠贷款利率，目前已达１０．５％，而联邦储备委员会贴现率自去年８月份以来尚未变动。鉴于目前经济呈过热现象，提高联邦储备委员会的贴现率只是一个时间问题。倘若这样，将从客观上促进美元汇率反弹。
    第三，国际因素。去年西方七国首脑会议上，尽管各国有其各自经济上的考虑，但一致认为美元汇价应该保持稳定，否则将有损于世界经济的增长。而且，西方七国已达成秘密协定，确定美元汇价上下浮动的限度，一遇险情就联手干预，使外汇市场置于可控状态。
    当然，从根本上讲，美元汇率的变化要受制于美国庞大的财政赤字改善到什么程度。由于即将上台的布什政府还未能拿出一项可行的削减财政赤字的方案，且解决财政赤字要碰到重重困难，因此，美元大幅度回升的可能性看来很小。
