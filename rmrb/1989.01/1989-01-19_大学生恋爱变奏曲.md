College students' love affairs, a topic that has always been sensitive and subtle, have now become a hot topic among college students. Contemporary college students, when "performing" the eternal theme of love, have introduced many variations with distinctive characteristics of the times.

Variation One: Increasing Number of Lovers

Saturday night. As the curtain of darkness falls, couples stroll along the paths, cuddle on the lawns, and under the trees in Sun Yat-sen University. Some couples even take cars to the city to spend the weekend under the neon lights.

This is a scene of college students' love affairs that the reporter witnessed. Such scenes are no longer rare in many universities.

Currently, how many college students are in love? It is difficult to get an exact number. According to reports, in a class of 35 students in a certain university in Beijing, 28 are in love. A survey at Sun Yat-sen University showed that more than 50% of the students are either in love or preparing to fall in love. The number of students in love is also shifting from seniors to juniors, showing an increasing trend.

The increase in the number of college students in love is closely related to their changing views on love. Most students agree that it is acceptable to fall in love during college. In a sample survey at Sun Yat-sen University, only 5% opposed it.

Variation Two: From Secret to Open

If you see male and female students in public displaying various affectionate behaviors, you need not be surprised. Students have become accustomed to this phenomenon.

In the past, many universities prohibited students from falling in love, and this was explicitly stated in the student handbook. At that time, students' love affairs were mostly conducted "underground." Now, things are different. Many schools have changed their stance from "prohibiting" love to "not allowing" or "not encouraging" it, or simply not mentioning it at all. Thus, students have no reservations about falling in love.

Nowadays, students not only do not mind others knowing about their love affairs but also have a mindset of deliberately letting others know. Some students, in addition to talking about love at night, also go to the reading room and the cafeteria in pairs during the day. Students jokingly refer to this as "from moonlight to sunlight."

Variation Three: Less Consideration of Marriage

Although the number of college students in love is high, the success rate is relatively low. This is because students' love affairs are more about emotions and less about marriage.

A male student from Fudan University, who has been in love for over a year, said: "I fall in love mainly to seek understanding and communication. Whether we can get married in the future is not something I consider now."

Most students' attitudes towards love are serious. They choose their lovers mainly based on personality, career aspirations, and whether they have interests in life. At the same time, some students, feeling that university life is dull and boring, enter into love affairs. These students seek spiritual solace through love.

Because the reasons for college students falling in love are diverse and emotions are the important basis, once there are cracks in the emotions, they part ways, and the success rate is naturally not high.

Variation Four: New Changes in Sexual Morality

Love inevitably involves relationships between the sexes. The sexual morality of contemporary college students has undergone significant changes. Unmarried cohabitation among college students is gradually increasing.

Now, many students view sexual relationships as a natural result of emotional development. However, unmarried cohabitation has caused some chaos: secluded places in the campus often become the venues for lovers to engage in sexual relationships, and some students even bring their girlfriends to the dormitory to cohabit. Some students, after having sexual relationships, become pregnant and have abortions, affecting their health and normal studies.

The Unfinished Symphony

The rise of the "love craze" among college students has brought great trouble to the management of universities. However, opinions on how to manage this are divided in many places. A class advisor from the University of Science and Technology of China said: "College students' love affairs are a new problem that urgently needs to be solved in front of us."

Suppression is not the solution, and neither is laissez-faire. However, how to guide students in love and make it develop healthily, many universities are still in a state of confusion.

### 大学生恋爱变奏曲

　　大学生恋爱变奏曲
    新华社记者  宋斌
    大学生恋爱，这个一向敏感、微妙的问题，如今成为大学生们谈论的热点之一。当代大学生在“演奏”恋爱这个人类永恒的主题曲时，出现了许多带有时代特色的“变奏”。
    　　　　变奏一：恋爱人数剧增
    星期六。夜幕垂落。中山大学校园里，一对对情侣或漫步于幽径，或依偎在草坪、树丛。有的恋人则双双乘汽车去霓虹灯闪烁的城区度周末。
    这是记者目睹的大学生恋爱的一幕。这种情景在许多高校已不足为奇。
    目前大学生究竟有多少人谈恋爱？精确的数字很难统计。据介绍，北京某高校的一个班级共３５人，谈恋爱的就有２８人。中山大学的一次调查显示，已经谈和准备谈恋爱的学生要占到５０％以上。谈恋爱的学生也开始由高年级向低年级发展，人数呈增多趋势。
    大学生恋爱人数增多，与他们恋爱观的转变密切相关。大多数学生赞成在校期间可以谈恋爱，中山大学的抽样调查中，反对者只占５％。
    　　　　变奏二：从隐蔽到公开
    如果在校园中看到一些男女学生在大庭广众中做出各种亲昵举动，你大可不必惊奇。因为学生们对这种现象已习以为常。
    过去许多高校是禁止学生谈恋爱的，并明文写进学生手册。那时学生谈恋爱大多是在“地下”活动。现在则不同了。许多学校对恋爱的限制已从“禁止”变成了“不准”、“不提倡”，或干脆不提。这样，学生谈恋爱便没什么顾忌。
    现在学生谈恋爱，不仅不怕别人知道，而且有故意让人知道的心态。有些学生除了晚上谈情说爱，白天进阅览室、上食堂也成双成对。学生们戏称这是“从月光下谈到了阳光下”。
    　　　　变奏三：较少考虑婚姻目的
    大学生谈恋爱的人数虽多，但成功率较低。这是因为学生谈恋爱多以感情为重，而较少考虑婚姻问题。
    复旦大学一位已有一年多恋爱史的男生说：“我谈恋爱主要是为了寻求理解和沟通。至于以后能否结婚，不是现在考虑的问题。”
    应该说，大多数学生的恋爱态度是严肃的。他们选择恋人也大多以个性、事业心、是否有生活情趣等为主要条件。同时，也有一些学生因感到大学生活枯燥无味、空虚无聊而投入恋爱之中的。这些学生想通过恋爱寻求精神寄托。
    正因为大学生谈恋爱的原因各异，又以感情为重要基础，所以，一旦感情出现裂痕便分道扬镳，成功率自然不高。
    　　　　变奏四：性道德的新变化
    恋爱必然牵涉到两性关系。当代大学生性道德的观念已发生了显著变化。大学生未婚同居逐渐多了起来。
    现在不少学生把性关系看成感情发展的自然结果。然而，未婚同居却引起了一些混乱：校园的僻静处常常成为恋人们发生两性关系的场所，有的学生甚至将女朋友带到集体宿舍同居。有的学生发生性关系后导致怀孕流产，影响了身体健康和正常学习。
    　　　　并未结束的乐章
    大学生“恋爱热”的兴起，给高校的管理带来很大麻烦。但对此如何管理，在不少地方却意见不一。中国科大的一位班主任说：“大学生恋爱是摆在我们面前的一个急待解决的新问题。”
    压制不行，放任也不是明智之举。但究竟如何引导学生恋爱，使之健康发展，许多高校仍在茫然中。
