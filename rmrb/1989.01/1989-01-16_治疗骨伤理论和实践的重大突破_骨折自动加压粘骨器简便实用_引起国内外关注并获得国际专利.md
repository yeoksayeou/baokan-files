Major Breakthrough in Bone Injury Treatment Theory and Practice
Bone Fracture Automatic Pressure Bonding Device Simple and Practical
Attracts Domestic and International Attention and Obtains International Patent

Xinhua News Agency, Chengdu, January 15th: Reporter Luo Maocheng reports: The reporter learned today at the news conference of the Sichuan Biological Medical Engineering Research and Development Center that the "Bone Fracture Automatic Pressure Bonding Device" invented by Zhou Chonglin, Deputy Chief Physician of the Orthopedics Department of West China Medical University, and Zhou Xihua, Associate Professor of Pediatric Orthopedics, has attracted domestic and international attention and obtained an international patent. The European Patent Office announced it to the world on December 14th last year.

Previously, the treatment of bone fractures generally involved the use of steel plates, screws, nails, and intramedullary pins, as well as compression steel plates and screws for fixation. However, these methods still could not avoid the need to drill holes in the bone at the fracture site and insert pins into the bone marrow cavity, which often led to damage to the bone tissue and blood vessels within the bone. This caused stress concentration at the fracture site, resulting in stress shielding and compression necrosis.

The bone fracture automatic pressure bonding device is based on the theory of combining motion and stillness in traditional Chinese medicine for treating fractures with small splints, combined with modern biomechanics and bionics principles. It is characterized by not needing to drill holes in the bone or insert pins into the bone marrow cavity during fracture fixation, thus avoiding further damage to the bone tissue and surviving blood vessels at the fracture site. It preserves the integrity of bone fragments and the normal shape of the bone, utilizing the transmission of gravitational force to generate physiological automatic compression stress stimulation at the fracture surface, completely avoiding stress concentration and compression necrosis. Additionally, after surgery, there is no need for external fixation, allowing for early movement of the affected limb, which not only prevents joint stiffness and muscle atrophy but also reduces the workload of medical care, nursing, and accompanying. Therefore, internationally renowned biomechanics experts, including the Executive Chairman of the European Biomechanics Society, Kang Zhenhuang, and more than ten professors, believe that this invention represents a major breakthrough in both theory and practice.

　　治疗骨伤理论和实践的重大突破
    骨折自动加压粘骨器简便实用
    引起国内外关注并获得国际专利
    本报成都１月１５日电  记者罗茂城报道：记者今天在四川生物医学工程研究开发中心新闻发布会上获悉：华西医科大学骨科副主任医师周崇林、儿外骨科副教授周锡华发明的“骨折自动加压粘骨器”引起国内外关注并获国际专利，欧洲专利中心已于去年１２月１４日向全世界公布。
    过去治疗骨折一般使用钢板螺丝钉、髓内针和加压钢板螺钉等固定。但是，此种治疗法仍然未能摆脱需在骨折处钻孔和骨髓腔内穿针的困境，同时容易引起对骨组织及骨组织内的血管破坏，对骨折处产生应力集中，造成应力遮挡和压迫性骨坏死。
    骨折自动加压粘骨器是根据我国中医小夹板治疗骨折的动静结合理论，结合现代生物力学和仿生物理原理研制成功的。它的特点是固定骨折时不再骨中钻孔和骨髓腔内穿针，以免进一步损伤骨组织和骨折处幸存血管，能保存骨折碎片的完整性及骨的正常外形，利用自重力的传导在骨折断面上产生了生理性自动加压应力刺激，完全不产生应力集中和压迫性骨坏死。此外，手术后不用外固定、早期活动患肢，不但防止了关节僵硬和肌肉萎缩，而且减轻了医疗、护理、陪伴的工作量。因此，国际著名生物力学专家、欧洲生物力学协会执行主席康振黄等１０几位教授认为，这项发明在理论和实践上都有重大的突破。
