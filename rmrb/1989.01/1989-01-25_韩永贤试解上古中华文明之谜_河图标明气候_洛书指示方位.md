Han Yongxian attempts to solve the mystery of ancient Chinese civilization: the River Chart indicates climate, the Luo Chart indicates direction

New China News Agency, Hohhot, January 24th - (Reporter Shi Yunzi) The "River Chart" and "Luo Chart," which are considered mysteries of Chinese civilization, have been scientifically explained. The paper written by Inner Mongolia scholar Han Yongxian has been praised by relevant experts in Beijing for its originality. The world-renowned historian of science, British scholar Joseph Needham, also praised this academic achievement as very valuable.

Our ancient texts record "The River produced the Chart, the Luo produced the Book," and people believe that in ancient China, there were already books and charts. The River Chart and Luo Chart have become important topics in the study of the "Book of Changes." Previously, scholars studying the River Chart and Luo Chart have all been stuck on the concept of numbers, never analyzing the composition of the charts. Thus, for thousands of years, these two grid charts composed of circles, dots, and lines have been like a numerical maze, mysterious and baffling, leaving people puzzled and confused.

Han Yongxian, an old teacher at the Inner Mongolia Tongliao Animal Husbandry College, has long been engaged in physical education research and has been diligently studying the "Book of Changes." The journal "Inner Mongolia Social Sciences" published his recently completed paper "An Exploration of the River Chart and Luo Chart." Han Yongxian believes that the original River Chart and Luo Chart are both top-down projection plane charts, which should actually be three-dimensional charts. Based on the theory of the round heaven and square earth, using modern natural science methods, he restored these two charts into three-dimensional perspective charts and provided scientific explanations. His conclusion is: the River Chart is actually a climate chart from the pre-literate era, revealing that humans first had symbols, then characters, and that the symbol era already had the concept of numbers, as well as perspective and geometric knowledge. The author of the River Chart was likely the tribal leader Fu Xi. The Luo Chart is a directional chart, that is, a compass carved on a stone in ancient nomadic times, indicating that astronomy had already begun to emerge at that time.

Han Yongxian believes that the cultural science of the primitive clan society's symbol era had a fairly high level, and through the exploration of the River Chart and Luo Chart, one can glimpse a contour of China's ancient culture. He believes that the mythical Fu Xi was a real person and was also a knowledgeable expert in science and technology who guided nomadic hunting and fishing. Han Yongxian is now further developing a series of studies including the prehistory of symbols, the history of symbols, the history of characters, and the history of new symbols.

　　韩永贤试解上古中华文明之谜
  　河图标明气候　洛书指示方位
    新华社呼和浩特１月２４日电（记者石云子）被视为中华文明之谜的“河图”“洛书”，有了科学的解释。内蒙古学者韩永贤为此发表的论文，得到北京有关专家赞许，认为它具有独创精神。世界科学史研究权威、英国李约瑟博士也称赞这一学术成果很有价值。
    我国古籍有“河出图，洛出书”的记载，人们相信在遥远的古代中国已出现了图书。河图、洛书成为《周易》学术重要课题。以往学者们研究河图、洛书，都在数的概念上徘徊，从不对图的构成进行析解。于是，千百年来，这两幅由圈圈点点和线条组成的方阵图，犹如数字迷宫，神秘莫测，令人迷惑不解。
    内蒙古通辽畜牧学院老教师韩永贤，长期从事物理教研工作，并孜孜不倦地钻研《周易》之学。《内蒙古社会科学》杂志刊登了他新近完成的《对河图洛书的探究》论文。韩永贤认为，河图、洛书原图均为俯视投影的平面图，其实应是立体图。他依据天圆地方说，运用近代自然科学方法，把这两幅图复原成立体透视图，并作出科学解释。他的结论是：河图实乃无文字时代的气候图，揭示了人类先有记号、后有文字，记号时代已产生数的观念，且具备透视概念和几何知识。河图作者很可能是游牧部落首领伏羲氏。洛书则为方位图，也就是上古游牧时代刻在石头上的罗盘，这表明那时天文科学已悄然萌芽。
    韩永贤认为，原始氏族社会记号时代的文化科学已有相当高的水平，通过对河图、洛书的探究，可以窥见我国远古文化的一个轮廓。他认为，神话传说中的伏羲氏确有其人，而且他还是一位科技知识渊博、指导游牧渔猎的专家。韩永贤现在正进一步开展包括记号史前史、记号史、文字史、新记号史的一系列研究。
