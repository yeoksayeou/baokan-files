Speech impediments are no longer considered incurable. Patients do not need to take medication, receive injections, or undergo surgery. Under the guidance of a doctor, they only need to undergo 20 days of speech function correction training to recover.

Speech impediments include stuttering, lisping, nasal speech, and partial mutism. People with these conditions have difficulty pronouncing words clearly, speaking coherently, and communicating effectively.

Wang Wei, the 30-year-old director of the Guangyuan City Speech Impediment Correction Hospital in Sichuan, has been dedicated to researching speech impediment correction since 1980. After years of exploration, with the help of the Guangyuan City Civil Affairs Bureau and the Disabled Persons' Welfare Foundation, he established a hospital specializing in the treatment of speech impediments. He has already treated nearly a thousand patients from various regions, with an effectiveness rate of 95% and a cure rate of over 75%.

In the past, Wang Wei himself was a patient with a speech impediment. Since childhood, due to a congenital short frenulum, he had difficulty speaking clearly and could not pronounce certain words. He underwent three surgeries to cut the frenulum at hospitals in Shanghai, Guangzhou, and Chongqing, but none were effective. In 1978, at the Affiliated Hospital of Xi'an Medical University, renowned otolaryngologist Professor Zhang Naihua guided him through tongue articulation, pronunciation, and breathing function training. He corrected his pronunciation and tongue position, and invited a radio announcer to help him with speech function training. After half a year, he regained his speech function. During this process, Wang Wei accumulated a wealth of materials. After recovering, he combined linguistics and pathology, writing the paper "The Role of Dialectics in Speech Impediment Correction" and the book "Stuttering and Its Correction."

　　王伟久病成良医  口语障碍廿日除
    本报讯  口语障碍现在已不再是难治的病症了。患者不需要服药、打针、做手术，只在医生的指导下，进行２０天说话功能矫正训练就能康复。
    口语障碍包括结巴、夹舌子、瓮鼻子和半哑子。患有这种病症的人吐字不清，说话不明，语言交流困难。
    ３０岁的四川广元市口语障碍矫治医院院长王伟，从１９８０年开始潜心钻研口语障碍矫治。经过几年的探索，在广元市民政局和残疾人福利基金会帮助下，他建起了一所专治口语障碍病的医院，已为各地近千名患者矫治，有效率达９５％，治愈率达７５％以上。
    过去，王伟曾是一个口语障碍病患者，从小因先天性舌系带过短，说话不清，有些字根本发不出音来。他先后三次到上海、广州、重庆的一些医院作舌系带剪断手术，均未见效。１９７８年，在西安医学院附属医院，著名耳鼻喉科专家张乃华教授带他进行舌头吐字发音和呼吸功能训练，纠正发音的口型、舌位，又请广播电台播音员带他进行说话功能训练。经过半年时间，他恢复了说话功能。在这个过程中，王伟积累了较为丰富的资料，病愈后他便把语言学和病理学结合，写出《辩证法在语言障碍矫正中的作用》论文和《口吃与矫治》一书。
