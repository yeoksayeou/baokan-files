	In Beijing, mass tennis activities are obviously developing faster than competitive tennis. More than 230 middle-aged and elderly players have signed up for the city's 10th "Health Cup" tennis invitational, which will begin on the 15th, surprising the organizers.

	In the past nine tournaments, most participants were from the political and social elite, but this year, the main participants will be researchers, teachers, doctors, and workers from grassroots units that have tennis courts. Statistics show that in the past two years, the number of tennis courts in Beijing has increased from a dozen to nearly sixty. Zhang Baifa, the chairman of the organizing committee and vice mayor, said that in the near future, Beijing will add more tennis courts to meet the fitness needs of its citizens.

	This tournament is jointly organized by the Beijing Tennis Association and the Hong Kong Shijiafa Limited Company.

　　北京群众网球活动发展迅速
    二百余名中老年争夺健康杯
    本报讯  记者缪鲁报道：在北京，群众性网球活动显然要比竞技网球运动发展得更快。报名参加将于十五日开场的该市第十届“健康杯”网球邀请赛的中老年选手多达二百三十人，令主办者大感意外。
    在以往的九届比赛中，参赛者多为政界和社会名流，而今年唱主角的将是来自拥有网球场的基层单位的科研人员、教师、医生和工人。据统计，在过去两年间，北京市的网球场已由过去的十几块增加到近六十块。这次比赛的组委会主任、副市长张百发曾表示，近期内，北京市的网球场还要有所增加，以满足市民的健身需要。
    这次比赛是由北京市网球协会和香港事佳发有限公司联合主办的。
