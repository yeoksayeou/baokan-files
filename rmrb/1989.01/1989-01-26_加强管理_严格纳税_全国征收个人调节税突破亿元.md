In 1988, China's collection of individual income adjustment tax made significant progress, with a total of 114.64 million yuan collected, an increase of 2.66 times compared to 31 million yuan in 1987. This has played an active role in reasonably adjusting the income levels of citizens, controlling the rapid growth of consumption funds, and alleviating social distribution imbalances.

Individual income adjustment tax is a new tax category introduced to support the development of a planned commodity economy. Last year, the tax authorities focused on three areas: tax law propaganda, departmental cooperation, and institutional building, with notable effects. The main achievements are as follows:

First, citizens' awareness of tax compliance has improved. Various levels of tax authorities across the country have conducted in-depth and detailed tax law propaganda, commended advanced individuals, and criticized laggards, enhancing citizens' awareness of tax compliance. The number of people voluntarily declaring and paying taxes has been increasing. It is understood that in Beijing, the amount voluntarily declared and paid in 1988 accounted for 15% of the total, a significant increase compared to 1987.

Second, withholding and remittance has been effective. Local tax authorities have actively collaborated with the Ministry of Finance, the State Education Commission, the State Science and Technology Commission, the Ministry of Culture, the Ministry of Radio, Film, and Television, the People's Bank of China, the State Press and Publication Administration, and other departments to establish a large number of withholding and remittance units. At the same time, they have also worked with the departments of industry and commerce, public security, supervision, and prosecution to jointly investigate and handle various tax evasion, avoidance, and resistance incidents. The strengthened cooperation between departments has effectively strengthened tax source control and reduced the loss of state tax revenue. For example, the tax bureau of Jishan County in Shanxi Province, through cooperation with the county postal service, discovered that six taxpayers in the county had taxable income of 10.6 million yuan in one instance.

Third, tax collection and management work is gradually becoming standardized and institutionalized. Last year, various levels of tax authorities, in response to the high mobility of individual income, universally established dedicated accounts for individual income adjustment tax. Provinces and municipalities such as Fujian, Shanghai, and Beijing have also formulated "Payment Certificates for Individual Special Income," which require all units paying taxable income to individuals to fill out certificates and submit them to the local tax authorities. Various places have also successively formulated supervision and reporting systems to encourage all members of society to expose the tax evasion and avoidance behaviors of some taxpayers.

　　加强管理　严格纳税    
    全国征收个人调节税突破亿元
    本报讯  １９８８年，我国个人收入调节税的征收工作取得了突破性进展，共征收税款１．１４６４亿元，比１９８７年的３１００万元增长了２．６６倍，对合理调节公民个人收入水平，控制消费基金的过快增长，缓解社会分配不公起到了积极作用。
    个人收入调节税是为了发展有计划商品经济需要而开征的新税种。去年，税务部门着重抓了税法宣传、部门协作和制度建设三方面工作，效果比较显著。主要表现为：
    一、公民纳税自觉性有所提高。全国各级税务机关通过深入细致的税法宣传，表彰先进，批评落后，增强了公民依法纳税的观念，主动申报纳税的人数不断增加。据了解，北京市１９８８年征收的税款中，主动申报纳税的数额占到总额的１５％，比１９８７年有大幅度提高。
    二、代扣代缴有成效，各地税务机关主动与财政部、国家教委、国家科委、文化部、广播电影电视部、人民银行、新闻出版署等部门配合，建立了一大批代扣代缴单位；与此同时，他们还和工商、公安、监察、检察等执法部门联合查处各种偷、漏、抗税事件。部门间协作配合的加强，有效地加强了税源控制，减少了国家税款的流失。山西省稷山县税务局通过与县邮电局合作，一次就查出该县６名纳税人应纳税收入１０６万元。
    三、征管工作逐步走向正规化和制度化。去年，各级税务机关针对个人收入流动性大的特点，普遍建立了掌握个人收入调节税专户档案；福建、上海、北京等省市还制定了《支付个人收入特种凭证》，即凡支付给个人应纳税收入的单位，都必须填写单证，报送当地税务机关；各地还先后制定了监督举报制度，鼓励全社会成员揭露少数纳税人的偷漏税行为。　　　　　　　　　　　（韩国荣）
