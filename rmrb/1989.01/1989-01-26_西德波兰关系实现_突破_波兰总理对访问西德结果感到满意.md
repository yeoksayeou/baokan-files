West German-Polish Relations Achieve "Breakthrough"

Polish Prime Minister Satisfied with Visit to West Germany

Bonn, January 24 (Reported by Jiang Jian Guo) — Polish Prime Minister Rakowski's four-day private visit to the Federal Republic of Germany concluded yesterday. He told the press that he was "very satisfied" with the results of his series of informal talks. Local opinion holds that West German-Polish relations have achieved a "breakthrough."

Prime Minister Rakowski took the opportunity of celebrating the 75th birthday of the honorary chairman of the German Social Democratic Party and former Chancellor Brandt to visit West Germany privately. He held talks with President Weizsacker, Chancellor Kohl, Foreign Minister Genscher, and Economic Minister Haussmann, and met with representatives of the West German business community. They exchanged views on a series of major issues concerning bilateral relations. According to West German government spokesman Ost, both sides agreed that this meeting has opened up important prospects for developing cooperative relations between the two countries in all fields. Chancellor Kohl stated that West Germany is willing to "revitalize" relations between the two countries, and once conditions are met, he will strive to visit Poland in the first half of this year. President Weizsacker also hopes to visit Poland this year. Yesterday, Chancellor Kohl appointed his foreign policy advisor Terzick as a personal representative to handle West German-Polish relations, and the Polish side appointed the leader of the Polish United Workers' Party Central Committee department, Kucza, as the Polish government representative. The two will, together with the West German-Polish working group, discuss bilateral relations without any restrictions.

This round of talks focused on bilateral economic relations, particularly West Germany's provision of new financial aid to Poland and the restructuring of Poland's enormous debt to West Germany. It is reported that West Germany is prepared to partially forgive the 1 billion Mark loan provided to Poland in 1975, with the remaining amount to be repaid by Poland in its own currency. At Poland's request, West Germany is prepared to consider resuming the export credit state guarantee that was suspended since the imposition of martial law in Poland.

　　西德波兰关系实现“突破”    
    波兰总理对访问西德结果感到满意
    本报波恩１月２４日电  记者江建国报道：波兰总理拉科夫斯基对联邦德国进行的４天私人访问已经在昨天结束。他昨天对新闻界表示，他对此行一系列非正式会谈的结果“非常满意”。此间舆论认为，西德波兰关系已经实现“突破”。
    拉科夫斯基总理是利用庆祝德国社会民主党名誉主席、前总理勃兰特７５岁生日的机会来西德进行私人访问的。他先后同魏茨泽克总统、科尔总理、外交部长根舍、经济部长豪斯曼举行了会谈，并会见西德经济界代表，就双边关系一系列重大问题广泛交换了意见。据西德政府发言人奥斯特说，双方一致认为此次会晤为发展两国在所有领域的合作关系开辟了重要前景。科尔总理表示，西德愿意使两国关系“重新活跃起来”，一旦条件具备，他将争取在今年上半年访问波兰。魏茨泽克总统也希望在今年内访问波兰。科尔总理昨天任命他的外交政策顾问特尔契克为处理西德波兰关系的私人代表，波兰方面任命波兰统一工人党中央委员会部门领导人库查为波兰政府代表，两人将同西德波兰工作小组一道，对双边关系进行“没有禁区”的讨论。
    这次会谈集中在双边经济关系方面，特别是西德为波兰提供新的财政援助及重新安排波兰欠西德巨额债务问题。据透露，西德准备部分免除１９７５年西德向波兰提供的１０亿马克贷款，剩余部分波兰将用本国货币偿还。应波兰要求，西德准备考虑恢复自波兰军管以来中断的出口信贷国家担保。
