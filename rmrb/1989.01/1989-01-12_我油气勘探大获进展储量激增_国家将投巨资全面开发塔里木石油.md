China's oil and gas exploration has made significant progress, with reserves increasing rapidly. The state will invest heavily in the comprehensive development of the Tarim oil field.

According to Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, January 10th (reporter Zhao Mingliang): The general manager of the China National Petroleum Corporation, Wang Tao, announced: After two to three years of effort, China has the potential to enter a new peak period of oil and gas reserve growth.

In recent years, China's oil and gas exploration work has made important discoveries in both new and old areas, with significant progress in the eastern, western, and southern regions, indicating that China's oil and gas reserves are on a continuous upward trend.

In 1988, the newly discovered geological reserves of oil and recoverable reserves were 540 million tons and 400 million tons, respectively, both showing an increase over the previous year; the newly added geological reserves of natural gas were 52 billion cubic meters, and the recoverable reserves were 30 billion cubic meters, the highest in history.

It is reported that at present, six new oil fields with relatively large oil and gas areas have been formed nationwide. They are: the eastern part of the Junggar Basin in Xinjiang, the Chaluhe in Jilin, the southern part of Kongdian in Dagang, the Nanbao in Suizhong, the Erlian in Inner Mongolia, and the Gasikule in Qinghai. The predicted crude oil reserves in these oil fields are 26 billion tons, with 5.3 billion tons already discovered, and it is estimated that another 5 billion tons can be discovered in the next two years.

More encouragingly, China's two major oil and gas strategic replacement areas have made important breakthroughs. One is the Tarim Basin in Xinjiang, where well Lunnan 2 discovered a total oil layer thickness of 155.6 meters. Two tests yielded daily oil production of 734 cubic meters and 510 cubic meters, respectively, and natural gas production of 110,000 cubic meters, with good oil quality and easy extraction. The second is the coastal and shallow sea areas of the Bohai Bay, where over 1 billion tons of recoverable oil reserves have been discovered, indicating the possibility of large oil fields in this region.

Progress in natural gas exploration is also significant. Large gas fields have been discovered in the central and southern parts of Sichuan and the eastern part of the Junggar Basin in Xinjiang, with proven reserves of 253 billion cubic meters and 130 billion cubic meters, respectively.

According to a report from today's national petroleum work conference, China will further strengthen the exploration of the Tarim Basin starting this year. Despite the current financial difficulties, 1.4 to 1.5 billion yuan will be invested over the next two years, and elite forces will be mobilized to accelerate the exploration of oil and gas resources in the region.

The Tarim Basin in Xinjiang is China's largest sedimentary basin, covering an area of 560,000 square kilometers. It is one of the few large sedimentary basins in the world that have not yet undergone comprehensive oil and gas exploration.

The China National Petroleum Corporation has established the Tarim Oil Exploration and Development Command to strive for the discovery and control of a certain scale of oil and gas reserves, followed by the establishment of a certain production capacity, to contribute to the increase in oil and gas production during the "Eighth Five-Year Plan" period.

　　我油气勘探大获进展储量激增
    国家将投巨资全面开发塔里木石油
    据新华社北京１月１０日电  （记者赵明亮）中国石油、天然气总公司总经理王涛宣布：再经过两三年的努力，我国很有可能迎来一个新的油气储量增长高峰期。
    近年来我国石油、天然气勘探工作在新区、老区均有重要发现，东部、西部和南方地区都取得新的进展，表明我国油气储量已呈现不断增长的趋势。
    １９８８年新探明的石油地质储量和可采储量分别是５．４亿吨和４亿吨，比上年都有增长；新增加的天然气地质储量５２０亿立方米、可采储量３００亿立方米，这是历史上最多的一年。
    据介绍，目前全国已形成６个含油气场面比较大的新油区。它们是：新疆准噶尔盆地东部、吉林岔路河、大港孔店南部、冀东南堡、内蒙古二连、青海尕斯库勒等地区。这些油区预测原油储量为２６亿吨，已探明５．３亿吨，预计近两年还可探明５亿吨左右。
    更为可喜的是，我国油气两大战略接替区获得重要突破。一是新疆塔里木盆地，在轮南２井发现了总厚度为１５５．６米的含油层。两次测试分别获得日产原油７３４立方米和５１０立方米、天然气１１万立方米的高产油气流，而且原油质量好，容易开采。二是渤海湾海滩及极浅海地带，现已获得可采石油储量１亿多吨，表明这一地区可能存在着大型油田。
    天然气勘探进展也比较大。现已在四川中南部和新疆准噶尔盆地东部发现大型气田，已探明储量分别是２５３亿立方米和１３０亿立方米。
    本报北京１月１０日讯　记者从今天召开的全国石油工作会议上获悉：我国从今年起将进一步加强塔里木盆地的勘探工作，在目前财力十分困难的条件下，今明两年投资１４至１５亿元，并调集精兵强将，加快勘探该地区油气资源。
    新疆塔里木盆地是我国最大的沉积盆地，面积５６万平方公里，是世界上仅存的少数几个尚未进行全面油气勘探的大型沉积盆地之一。
    中国石油天然气总公司已成立塔里木石油勘探开发指挥部，争取探明和控制相当规模的油气储量，随后建成一定的生产能力，为“八五”油气产量的增长出力。
