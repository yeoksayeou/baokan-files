The European Community and the Gulf Cooperation Council Hold Talks
Seek to Sign a More Liberal Trade Agreement

NEW DELHI, Jan. 25 (Xinhua) -- According to European Community officials, high-level officials from the Community and the Gulf Cooperation Council held talks here on the 23rd to discuss the possibility of signing a more liberal trade cooperation agreement between the two organizations.

During the talks, Gulf Cooperation Council Secretary-General Abdullah Bishara expressed the hope that the two sides could quickly reach a more liberal trade agreement. In response to the Community's concerns about protecting its member states' petrochemical industries, Bishara stated that the Gulf Cooperation Council would never seek to interfere with any European industry, but rather to sign a more liberal trade agreement.

The Community side hopes to quickly begin formal negotiations with the Gulf Cooperation Council to sign a trade agreement. However, Martin Bangemann, a member of the Community's Commission who participated in the talks, said that many subtle issues still need to be resolved before formal negotiations can begin.

He suggested that the two sides discuss and clarify these issues together.

The European Community and the Gulf Cooperation Council signed their first trade agreement last year. At that time, the two sides agreed to negotiate a second agreement in the future to gradually achieve bilateral free trade.

　　欧共体与海湾合作委员会会谈
    寻求签订更自由的贸易协定
    新华社布鲁塞尔１月２５日电  据欧洲共同体人士今天透露，共同体和海湾合作委员会双方高级官员２３日在这里举行会谈，讨论了两个组织间签订一项更加自由的贸易合作协定的可能性。
    在会谈中，海湾合作委员会秘书长阿卜杜拉·比沙拉希望双方能迅速达成一项更加自由的贸易协定。针对共同体保护成员国石油化工业的考虑，比沙拉表示，海湾合作委员会永远不会图谋干扰欧洲的任何工业部门，而只是寻求签订一项更加自由的贸易协定。
    共同体方面希望迅速地为签订贸易协定而与海湾合作委员会开始正式谈判。但是，参加会谈的共同体委员会委员马丁·班格曼表示，在正式谈判之前，有许多微妙的问题仍有待解决。
    他建议双方在将这些问题明确后共同予以讨论。
    欧洲共同体与海湾合作委员会于去年签订了第一个贸易协定。双方当时商定在以后就第二个协定举行谈判，以逐步实现双边自由贸易。
