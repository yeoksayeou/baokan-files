The world's rare bird species, the crested ibis, which inhabits our country, has naturally bred seven young birds this year.

According to a wildlife scholar, this is the highest number of natural breeding since the discovery of this nearly extinct bird species in Yang County, Shaanxi Province, in 1981.

The crested ibis is one of the most precious bird species in the world today. It is listed as a key protected species by the World Bird Conservation Committee and is listed as a Class I protected animal in our country. Currently, except for the three birds still kept in a Japanese zoo, all the rest live in southern Shaanxi Province.

In recent years, the state and Shaanxi Province have invested in the construction of a wild breeding ground for the crested ibis, creating a good environment for its survival, habitat, and breeding.

　　我国朱鹮世所稀  自然繁殖七幼鸟
    新华社西安１月２７日电（记者王世焕）栖息在我国境内的世界珍稀鸟类动物朱鹮年自然繁殖出７只幼鸟。
    据一位野生动物学者介绍，这是自１９８１年首次在陕西省洋县境内发现这一濒于绝迹的鸟类以来，朱鹮自然繁殖量最多的一年。
    朱鹮是当今世界上最珍贵的鸟类之一，被世界鸟类保护委员会列为重点保护对象，在我国被列入一类保护动物。目前，世界上除日本还在动物园饲养的３只以外，其余全部生活在我国陕西省南部。
    近几年，国家和陕西省投资兴建了朱鹮野外饲养场，为朱鹮的生存、栖息、繁殖创造了一个良好的环境。
