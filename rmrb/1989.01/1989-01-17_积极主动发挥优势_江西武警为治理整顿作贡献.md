	Actively Leveraging Strengths: Jiangxi Armed Police Contribute to Rectification and Order
	Xinhua News Agency, January 16th, Nanchang: Reporter Zhaoxiangru reports: The Jiangxi Provincial Armed Police Force has fully leveraged its role in maintaining social order, protecting reform, and safeguarding the lives and property of the people, making significant contributions to rectification and order.

	As the reform deepens, various unstable factors exist in different aspects of social life. The Jiangxi Armed Police Force has proactively assisted local authorities in rectifying economic order. The Jing'an County Armed Police detachment has dispatched over 200 personnel to assist forestry and public security authorities in seizing illegally logged timber worth over 300,000 yuan. In the "Porcelain Capital" of Jingdezhen City, a night market street for porcelain was plagued by thieves stealing valuable items, causing the market to decline. The Jingdezhen City Armed Police Detachment proactively designated this street as a mobile patrol point, maintaining order, and cracking down on illegal activities, restoring the bustling scene of the porcelain night market.

	The Jiangxi Armed Police Force has also actively participated in the comprehensive management of social order. They have organized 87 legal propaganda teams, using artistic performances to propagate legal knowledge to the masses. The first detachment stationed along the banks of Poyang Lake discovered that many rare birds were being hunted, so they conducted extensive "Bringing Law to Fishermen's Homes, Protecting Poyang Lake with Law" activities along the lake, enhancing the fishermen's sense of responsibility to "love and protect the lake and birds," maintaining the normal order of the Poyang Lake Nature Reserve.

	The Jiangxi Armed Police Force has educated its officers and soldiers to enhance their psychological resilience to reform. During the recent period of price hikes and panic buying, they consciously maintained the overall situation of reform, did not engage in panic buying of scarce goods, and did not raise prices for sales. Nearly a thousand officers have been saving money each month, voluntarily sharing the nation's worries.

　　积极主动发挥优势
    江西武警为治理整顿作贡献
    本报南昌１月１６日电  记者赵相如报道：江西省武警部队充分发挥维护社会治安的作用，保卫改革、保护人民生命财产，在治理、整顿中作出了贡献。  　在改革逐渐深化过程中，社会生活的各个领域存在着一些不安定因素。江西武警部队主动协助地方整治经济秩序。靖安县武警中队先后派出２００多人次，协助林业和公安机关清查收缴乱砍乱伐价值３０多万元的木材。“瓷都”景德镇市中心有一条瓷器夜市街，一些不法分子乘机抢窃贵重瓷器，造成夜市冷落。景德镇市武警支队主动把这条街列为流动执勤点，维持秩序，打击不法分子的活动，使瓷器街夜市恢复了热闹的景象。
    江西武警部队还积极参与社会治安的综合治理。他们先后组织了８７个法制宣传组，运用文艺形式向群众宣传法律常识。驻守在鄱阳湖沿岸的武警一支队，曾发现不少珍禽被捕杀，便到鄱湖沿岸广泛开展“送法进渔家，普法护鄱湖”的活动，使渔民增强“爱湖护湖、爱鸟护鸟”的责任感，维护了鄱阳湖自然保护区的正常秩序。
    江西武警部队教育干部战士增强对改革心理承受能力。前段时间当社会上出现乱涨价和抢购风时，他们自觉地维护改革大局，不抢购紧俏物资、不抬价出售商品，近千名干部每月坚持存款，自觉为国分忧。
