In response to the new situation where soldiers are being delayed in their discharge, the Nanjing Military Region has seized the opportunity at the end of the year and the beginning of the new year to concentrate on training dual-purpose talents. Currently, the entire military region has established 413 civilian skill training classes, with over 1,100 soldiers participating in various types of civilian knowledge and skill training, including vehicle driving, home appliance repair, planting and breeding, news writing, enterprise management, law, and accounting.

To ensure that soldiers who will be discharged in March this year each master at least one civilian skill, the Nanjing Military Region, based on its existing training foundation, allocated 400,000 yuan in talent development funds in October last year to arrange for the civilian skill training of veteran soldiers.

The civilian skill training currently being conducted by the Nanjing Military Region has several new features: First, it has appropriately handled the relationship between civilian skill training and other military tasks. The civilian skill training in various units is being carried out on the premise of ensuring the implementation of winter military training. Second, in response to the new developments in commodity economics and the new changes in soldiers' aspirations for success, the training content has been adjusted to include more courses in commodity operations, enterprise management, and township legal services. Third, the training has focused on veteran soldiers who have served for more than two years, are from rural areas, and do not possess military-civilian common skills.

　　让即将退伍的战士掌握民用技术
    南京军区集中开展培训工作
    本报讯  根据老战士推迟退伍的新情况，南京军区各部队利用岁末年初大好时机，集中开展培养两用人才工作。目前，全军区开办了４１３个民用技术训练班，１１００多名士兵正在参加车辆驾驶、家电维修、种植养殖、新闻写作、企业管理、法律、财会等各类民用知识和技能培训。
    为了使今年３月退伍的战士每人掌握一门以上的民用技术，南京军区在原有的培训基础上，于去年１０月拨出４０万元育才经费，对老战士的民用技术训练作了部署。
    目前，南京军区正在进行的民用技术训练有许多新的特点：一是比较妥善处理了民用技术训练与部队其他工作的关系，各部队的民用技术培训是在确保冬季军事训练落实的前提下进行的。二是根据商品经济的新发展和士兵成才意向的新变化，适当调整了培训内容，主要增加了商品经营、企业管理和乡镇法律服务等专业知识方面的科目。三是重点突出了服役两年以上农村籍不掌握军地通用技术的老战士的培训。
