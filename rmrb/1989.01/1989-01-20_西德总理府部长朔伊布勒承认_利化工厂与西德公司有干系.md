West German Chancellor's Office Minister Schöuble yesterday afternoon stated in the Federal Parliament regarding the Libyan chemical plant issue: "Based on the information from the intelligence agencies, we must start from the point that the equipment in Rabta is suitable for the production of chemical weapons." He also said that according to the current investigation, there are indications that West German companies are involved in the construction of this equipment.

Schöuble revealed some of the suspicions West Germany has had about the Rabta chemical plant.

He said that as early as August 1987, West German intelligence agencies, based on satellite images and other clues, believed that the industrial equipment appearing near Rabta was "highly likely to be a new chemical weapons factory," but at that time it was not known that West German companies were involved in the construction of this facility. In May 1988, the U.S. Embassy in West Germany submitted a document to the West German Foreign Ministry expressing concern that West German companies might be involved in this project. On May 25, this situation was reported to the Economic and Finance Ministries. In September-October 1988, the West German intelligence agency obtained clues. On October 20, the West German Chancellor was informed of some intelligence. On November 15, West German Chancellor Kohl, during a meeting in Washington with Schultz and the heads of U.S. intelligence agencies, was informed of clues regarding this matter.

West Germany then began an investigation within the country.

Schöuble said that the West German government will strengthen export controls on foreign trade, and penalties and fines for violators will be more severe. He said that chemical weapons are inhumane weapons and must be prevented from being developed and produced. The West German government is willing to take measures to prevent West German companies and individuals from participating in the production of chemical weapons.

　　西德总理府部长朔伊布勒承认
    利化工厂与西德公司有干系
    本报波恩１月１９日电  记者江建国报道：西德总理府部长朔伊布勒昨天下午在联邦议院就利比亚化工厂问题表态说：“根据情报机关了解的情况，我们必须从这一点出发，即拉布塔的设备是适于生产化学武器的”。他还说，根据目前的调查，存在着西德公司卷入兴建这个设备的线索。
    朔伊布勒披露了西德对拉布塔化工厂早有怀疑的某些情况。
    他说，早在１９８７年８月西德情报机关就根据卫星图片等提供的线索，认为拉布塔附近出现的工业设备，“极可能是一座新的化学武器工厂”，但当时并不知道西德公司卷入了这一设施的建设。１９８８年５月美国驻西德大使馆向西德外交部递交了一份文件，表示对西德公司能卷入这一工程感到忧虑。５月２５日这一情况通报给了经济部和财政部。１９８８年９—１０月间西德情报局得到线索。１０月２０日，西德总理被告知了某些情报。１１月１５日，西德总理科尔在华盛顿与舒尔茨和美国情报机关首脑谈话时，对方提到此事的线索。
    此后西德即在国内开始调查。
    朔伊布勒说，西德政府将加强外贸出口控制，对违法者的惩罚和罚款将更加严厉。他说，化学武器是一种非人道的武器，必须阻止它的研制和生产。西德政府愿意采取措施，防止西德公司和西德人参加到化学武器生产中去。
