During World War I, the German army released several tons of chlorine gas on the French military positions in the Ypres region of Belgium on April 22, 1915, causing 15,000 French soldiers to be poisoned and 5,000 to die. Subsequently, both sides used chemical agents against each other, resulting in 1.3 million casualties and setting a precedent for the large-scale use of chemical weapons on the battlefield.

Chemical weapons refer to the use of various harmful chemical substances loaded into launch weapons (such as grenades, landmines, artillery shells, bombs, rocket-propelled grenades, missile warheads, etc.) or sprayers on the battlefield to harm personnel, livestock, and destroy forests and crops. They can be classified into six types based on their harmful effects: nerve agents, vesicants, systemic poisons, choking agents, incapacitating agents, and irritants.

The number of countries possessing chemical weapons is increasing, posing a growing threat to the Earth's environment and human survival. In the 1970s, there were only seven countries in the world with chemical weapons. By the early 1980s, this number had risen to 16, and now there are 35 countries and regions that possess or may possess chemical weapons.

For a long time, the international community has made unremitting efforts to prohibit the production and use of chemical weapons. The 1899 Hague Convention on Land Warfare clearly stipulated the prohibition of the use of poison and poisonous weapons. On June 17, 1925, the Geneva Protocol (Prohibition of the Use in War of Asphyxiating, Poisonous or Other Gases, and of Bacteriological Methods of Warfare) was signed in Geneva, declaring that the contracting parties accept the principle of prohibiting the use of poison gas or similar poisons in warfare and agree to expand the scope of prohibition to include the prohibition of the use of bacteriological weapons in warfare. To date, 110 countries have participated in this protocol. On December 5, 1966, the United Nations General Assembly adopted a resolution calling on all countries to strictly adhere to the principles and rules stipulated in the 1925 Geneva Protocol and inviting all countries to sign the protocol. On December 16, 1969, the United Nations General Assembly adopted another resolution, declaring that the use of "any chemical agent or any biological agent" in international armed conflicts is a violation of the internationally recognized principles of the 1925 Geneva Protocol, and urging all countries to ratify or sign the Geneva Protocol by 1970.

The issue of prohibiting chemical and biological weapons was formally included in the agenda of the 18-nation Disarmament Committee in 1968, and negotiations on chemical weapons began in 1972. Since the first Special Session on Disarmament in 1978, the prohibition of chemical weapons has been one of the top priorities on the agenda of the Geneva Disarmament Conference. In 1980, the Special Committee on Chemical Weapons was established within the Disarmament Negotiations Committee. After years of negotiations, the Special Committee on Chemical Weapons proposed a draft convention on the prohibition of chemical weapons in 1984. In February 1988, the Geneva Disarmament Conference decided to reestablish the Special Committee on Chemical Weapons, which would be responsible for the entire and comprehensive negotiation process and for drafting a treaty on the destruction of chemical weapons and the comprehensive and effective prohibition of the development, production, and storage of chemical weapons.

As early as August 7, 1929, China participated in the Geneva Protocol. After the founding of the People's Republic of China, the Central People's Government reviewed the protocol in accordance with China's policies and announced on July 13, 1952, that it "acknowledges it and, on the basis of mutual adherence to the principles of the protocol by all countries, will strictly implement it." Since then, China has repeatedly stated its position on the comprehensive prohibition of chemical weapons at various international conferences and has submitted a series of documents and proposals to promote the early conclusion of a comprehensive convention on the prohibition of chemical weapons.

### 化学武器和禁止化学武器公约

　　化学武器和禁止化学武器公约
    第一次世界大战时，德国军队于１９１５年４月２２日向比利时伊普雷地区的法国军队阵地施放了几十吨氯气，造成法军１．５万人中毒，５０００人死亡。尔后，交战双方相互使用化学毒剂，使１３０万人受害，开创了在战场上大规模使用化学武器的先例。
    所谓化学武器，是将各种有害的化学物质装填到发射兵器（如：手榴弹、地雷、炮弹、炸弹、火箭弹、导弹弹头等）或喷洒器里，在战场上伤害人员、牲畜并毁坏森林和庄稼。按其伤害作用可分为神经性毒剂、糜烂性毒剂、全身中毒性毒剂、窒息性毒剂、失能性毒剂及刺激性毒剂６类。
    拥有化学武器的国家越来越多，给地球环境和人类的生存带来的威胁也日益严重。７０年代世界上拥有化学武器的国家仅有７个，８０年代初达到１６个，如今已有３５个国家和地区拥有或可能拥有化学武器。
    长期以来，国际社会为禁止生产和使用化学武器进行了不懈的努力。１８９９年的《海牙陆战法规惯例公约》就明确规定“禁止使用毒物和有毒武器”。１９２５年６月１７日在日内瓦签订的《关于禁用毒气或类似毒品及细菌方法作战的议定书》（简称《日内瓦议定书》）宣布：缔约国接受在战争中禁用毒气或类似毒品的原则，并同意将禁用范围扩大到不得使用细菌武器作战。迄今，参加这个议定书的国家已有１１０个。１９６６年１２月５日，联合国大会通过一项决议，号召一切国家严格遵守１９２５年《日内瓦议定书》规定的原则和守则，并邀请所有国家参加签署该议定书。１９６９年１２月１６日，联合国大会又通过一项决议，宣告在国际武装冲突中使用“任何化学药剂或任何生物细菌”都是违反１９２５年《日内瓦议定书》公认的国际法准则的，并敦促所有国家在１９７０年批准或参加签署《日内瓦议定书》。
    禁止化学、生物武器的问题１９６８年被正式列入当时的１８国裁军委员会议程，并从１９７２年开始专门进行化学武器问题谈判。自１９７８年第一届裁军特别联大以来，禁止化学武器一直是日内瓦裁军谈判会议议程中最优先的议题之一。１９８０年，在裁军谈判委员会内成立化学武器特别委员会。经过多年谈判，１９８４年，化学武器特别委员会提出了禁止化学武器公约的草案。１９８８年２月，日内瓦裁军谈判会议决定重新成立化学武器特别委员会，由它负责谈判的全部和全面进程，并负责制订关于销毁化学武器以及全面、有效地禁止研制、生产和储存化学武器的条约。
    早在１９２９年８月７日，中国就参加了《日内瓦议定书》。中华人民共和国成立后，中央人民政府根据我国政策对其进行审查，于１９５２年７月１３日宣布“予以承认，并在各国对于该议定书互相遵守的原则下，予以严格执行”。此后，我国在各种国际会议上多次申明全面禁止化学武器的主张，并为促进尽早缔结一项全面禁止化学武器公约，提出了一系列文件和建议。
