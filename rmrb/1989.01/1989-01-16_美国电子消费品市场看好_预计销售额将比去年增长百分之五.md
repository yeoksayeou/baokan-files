The U.S. electronic consumer goods market looks promising. It is predicted that sales will increase by five percent compared to last year.

Xinhua News Agency, Washington (Reporter: Zhao Zijian) The winter consumer electronics show in Las Vegas ended on January 10. Over 1,400 manufacturers showcased many innovative products.

The bustling exhibition presented a bright outlook for the U.S. electronics industry. According to industry experts, the sales revenue of U.S. electronic consumer goods, calculated at factory prices, is expected to reach $31.645 billion this year, a 5% increase from 1988.

One of the highlights of this large-scale exhibition is "home automation," which allows various household appliances to "communicate" with each other and be controlled centrally. For example, people can use the increasingly popular wireless phones to send commands to the home controller while driving back, instructing it to turn on the stove and prepare hot water. Without leaving the second-floor bedroom, one can use the electronic system to check if the front door downstairs is locked and turn off the hallway lights one by one.

Due to the increasing number of home-based businesses in the U.S., text fax machines have become popular in the past two years. Text fax machines come in various grades, but even the simplest models are usually equipped with memory systems.

Telephones, copiers, fax machines, televisions, and VCRs were the "mainstays" of this exhibition. However, low-end products are becoming fewer. There were no black-and-white televisions for sale at this exhibition. It is reported that 20 million televisions were sold across the U.S. last year.

The exhibition results show that electronic pedometers and calorie counters for fitness have a good market. Additionally, electronic game consoles are also selling well.

　　美国电子消费品市场看好
    预计销售额将比去年增长百分之五
    新华社华盛顿电  （记者赵子健）在美国拉斯韦加斯市举行的电子消费品冬季大展１月１０日结束。参展的１４００多家厂商推出了许多设计新颖的产品。
    展览会的盛况给美国电子工业展示了一片乐观前景。据该行业的专家估计，今年美国的电子消费品以出厂价计算的销售额可达３１６．４５亿美元，比１９８８年增长５％。
    这次大型展览的特点之一是“家庭自动化”，就是使各种用途的家用电器能“互通信息”，接受统一的指挥。例如，人们可用现在逐步普及的无线电话在驱车回家的路上给家里的控制器发出指令，让它打开炉灶、准备热水。人不离二楼寝室，就可以通过电子系统检查楼下的大门是否锁好，并将走廊里的灯一一关掉。
    由于美国的家庭企业日益增多，因此文字传真机成了最近两年的热门货。文字传真机的档次很多，但就是最简单的也大多装上了记忆系统。
    电话、复印机、文传机、电视机、录相机是这次展览会上的“大宗货物”。但低档产品越来越少。这次展览会上竟然没有黑白电视机卖。据报道，去年全美国共卖出了２０００万台电视机。
    展览的结果表明，健身用的电子计步器和卡路里计读器很有市场。另外，电子游戏机的销路也很好。
