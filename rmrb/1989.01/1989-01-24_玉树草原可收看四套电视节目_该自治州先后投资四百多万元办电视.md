The Qinghai-Tibet Plateau, which used to take ten days to half a month to receive news from the outside world through newspapers and mail, now has television equipment in every township, enriching the cultural life of the various ethnic groups in the pastoral areas.

This prefecture is located in a remote area with inconvenient transportation and poor information flow, making the cultural life of cadres and the masses very monotonous. To change this situation, they have invested over 420 million yuan in developing the television industry. By 1984, the first batch of television relay stations in six counties, including Yushu and Zaduo, was completed. Despite the hardships, they regularly went to the provincial television station to record and broadcast programs. By 1986, these six television relay stations had established satellite television ground reception and relay stations, directly receiving and relaying programs from Channel 1 of the Central Television Station. The Langqên County Television Station, despite financial difficulties and the lack of a studio, set up tents outdoors to broadcast on time, lasting for a year and a half.

With the support of the province, they equipped 33 remote townships without electricity with television recorders and small generators, allowing cadres and the masses in these townships to watch television and videos. In September last year, the Yushu Prefecture Television Station's broadcasting and television building and transmission tower were put into use, opening three channels of the Central Television Station. In addition to the original television relay station, residents of the prefecture capital, Jiegu Town, can now choose from four programs. Before the New Year's Day this year, 11 townships, including Lhabu, Xiewu, and Xiaosuomang, also installed satellite television ground reception stations, directly connecting the remote pastoral areas with the capital Beijing. To commemorate this joyous occasion, the herdsmen carved the date of the station's establishment on a stone with a Tibetan knife.

　　玉树草原可收看四套电视节目    
    该自治州先后投资四百多万元办电视
    本报讯  过去在十天半月后才能通过报刊邮政了解外界情况的玉树藏族自治州，如今乡乡有了电视设备，活跃了牧区各族群众的文化生活。
    这个州地处偏远，交通不便，信息闭塞，干部群众的文化生活十分单调。为了改变这一状况，他们先后为发展电视事业投资４２０多万元，到１９８４年首批建成玉树、杂多等６个县的录像电视转播台，不辞辛苦定期到省电视台录像转播。到１９８６年，这６个录像电视转播台又建立了卫星电视地面接收转播台，直接收转中央电视台一台播出的节目。囊谦县电视台在财力紧张没有机房的情况下，在露天下扎起帐篷按时转播，时间长达一年半之久。
    在省里的支持下，他们又给３３个偏远无电的乡配置了电视录放像机和小型发电机等成套设备，使这些乡的干部群众也看到了电视录像。去年９月，玉树州电视台的广播电视大楼和发射铁塔交付使用，开通了中央电视台三个频道的节目，加上原有的录像电视转播台，现在州府结古镇居民可在４套节目中自由选看。今年元旦前夕，拉布、歇武、小苏莽等１１个乡也安装了卫星电视地面接收站，把偏远的牧区直接与首都北京连在了一起。牧民们为纪念这一喜庆的日子，用藏刀把建站的日期刻在石头上。　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　（贺大明）
