Confusion and Aspirations

This is my family's junior high school first-year student who, in December last year, received dozens of New Year's cards. These New Year's cards are very exquisite, among which there are also high-grade scented New Year's cards that cost more than six yuan each.

"To receive without giving in return is not proper." My child also keeps asking for money from home to buy New Year's cards to return to his classmates. By the end of the year, he had spent over thirty yuan.

Now, there are still more than twenty days until the Spring Festival, and the child is still asking us for money. Not giving it will hurt the child's feelings; continuing to give it, we don't know how much more will be spent. We are confused and worried about this.

If we let children's competitive practice of giving high-end New Year's cards continue to develop, apart from fostering a trend of extravagance, it will not bring much benefit to the children. We believe that if parents and teachers work together to guide students to use their intelligence, let them make New Year's cards by hand and give them to their friends, it would be more meaningful.

We hope that in the future, someone will pay attention to this issue every year, so that children can enjoy the joy of making their own festival gifts from a young age!

### 困惑和愿望

　　困惑和愿望
    这是我家读初中一年级的孩子于去年十二月初陆续收到的几十张贺年片。这些贺年片十分精美，其中还有六元多一张的活动式香型高级贺年片。
    “来而不往，非礼也。”我家的孩子也从家里不断要钱，买贺年片回赠他的同学。年末一合计，他竟用去了三十多元。
    现在离春节还有二十多天，孩子仍在向我们要钱，不给吧，有伤孩子的感情；继续给吧，不知还要花多少钱。我们为之困惑和担忧。
    如果让孩子们的这种竞相攀比赠送高档贺年片的做法任其发展下去，除了助长奢侈之风以外，对孩子们来说，好处不多。我们认为，如果家长和教师合力诱导学生发挥他们的聪明才智，让他们自己动手精心制作贺年片馈送知己，岂不更有意义。
    但愿今后年年有人重视这一问题，让孩子们从小就享受自制节日礼品的乐趣！
