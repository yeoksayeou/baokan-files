On January 9, a reader from the Beijing New China Bookstore came to our newspaper to report the winter heating issues in their area. The summary is as follows:

Since the beginning of winter, several units and dormitories along Wangfujing Street in central Beijing, including the Beijing New China Bookstore, Audio-Visual Bookstore, Nationalities Bookstore, China Photography Studio, Red Maple Clothing Store, the dormitories of the Railway Performing Arts Troupe, and the Foreign Economic and Trade Department Guesthouse, have had heating issues. The indoor temperature ranges from 3°C to 10°C. Guests have checked out of the guesthouse; customers are scarce at the photography studio, bookstores, and clothing stores; and staff members work in thick coats and down jackets.

The low indoor temperature has affected the normal operations of these units along the street. The number of employees suffering from colds and other illnesses is increasing. Bookstores have had to take temporary measures, such as reducing operating hours by one hour. For this reason, several units have repeatedly written letters and visited the relevant departments of the Beijing Municipal Government to report the issue. The Beijing Municipal Government instructed the Dongcheng District Housing Management Bureau to come up with a solution by December 31, 1988, but as of January this year, when Beijing is in its coldest period, the problem has not been resolved. The visitors believe that if this situation continues, the health of the employees will be affected, and it will also be detrimental to improving the service quality of the capital's "civilized window." They appeal to the relevant units to genuinely solve their winter heating problems.

　　暖气不热谁来管
    １月９日，北京市新华书店一读者来本报反映他们所在地区冬季取暖问题，纪要如下：
    入冬以来，地处北京市中心王府井大街的北京新华书店、音像书店、民族书店、中国照相馆、红叶服装店、铁路文工团宿舍、对外经济贸易部招待所等几个单位和宿舍的暖气一直不热，室内的温度在３℃—１０℃之间。住单位招待所的客人退宿；照相馆、书店、服装店的顾客稀少；营业员身穿棉大衣、羽绒服工作。
    室内温度过低，影响了沿街这几家单位的正常工作，职工患感冒及其它病症的日渐增多，书店被迫采取临时措施，缩短一小时营业时间。为此，几家单位曾多次联名写信和登门向北京市有关部门反映。北京市政府责成东城区房管局于１９８８年１２月３１日前拿出解决办法，但直到今年１月，北京进入最冷时节，问题仍没有得到解决。来访人认为，长此下去，职工的身体健康会受影响，也不利于提高首都“文明窗口”的服务质量。他们呼吁有关单位切实解决他们的冬季取暖问题。
