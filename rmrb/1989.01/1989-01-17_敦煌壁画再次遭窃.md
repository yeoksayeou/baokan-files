The Dunhuang Mogao Cave murals have been stolen again, prompting urgent calls from Gansu provincial leaders for swift action to solve the case.

In 1986, the Mogao Caves experienced a theft of murals. This time, the stolen cave is Cave 465, with approximately 1 square meter of murals missing. The thieves used a method of cutting the murals into blocks, similar to the previous incident. This time, they cut the murals into 5 blocks, with one block broken at the crime scene.

Cave 465 is a non-opened cave in the Mogao Caves, dating back to the Yuan Dynasty. Its murals are of significant value both in form and content.

After discovering the theft on the 14th, Gansu Provincial Party Secretary Yan Haiwang and Vice Governor Liu Shu convened an emergency meeting to urge swift action to solve the case. Relevant officials from the Yumen Administrative Office and the Provincial Cultural Bureau rushed to the scene overnight. Liu Shu, who is scheduled to depart for Dunhuang tomorrow, said: "The precious cultural heritage of all humanity must not be allowed to be lost or destroyed again."

　　敦煌壁画再次遭窃
    新华社兰州１月１６日电  （记者曹永安）敦煌莫高窟壁画再次失盗，甘肃省领导紧急敦促破案。
    １９８６年莫高窟曾发生一起壁画失盗案。这次遭窃的洞窟为４６５窟，共失盗壁画１平方米左右，盗画者用分块切割的方法揭窃，与前次相同。这次共分切成５块，其中１块打碎在作案现场。
    ４６５窟为莫高窟的不开放洞窟，属元代，其壁画无论从形式到内容都具有重要价值。
    １４日发现壁画被盗后，甘肃省委副书记阎海旺、副省长刘恕今天召开紧急会议敦促早日破案，酒泉行署及省文化厅有关负责同志已连夜赶到现场。明日将启程赴敦煌的刘恕说：“全人类的宝贵文化遗产再也不容许遭到丢失和破坏了。”
