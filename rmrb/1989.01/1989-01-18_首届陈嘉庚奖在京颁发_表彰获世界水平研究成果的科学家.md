The first Chen Jiageng Award was presented in Beijing today, honoring scientists with world-class research achievements.

	The award ceremony for the first Chen Jiageng Award was held this morning at the Beijing Science Hall. The award, named after the renowned patriot and overseas Chinese leader Chen Jiageng, is presented by the Chen Jiageng Foundation.

	The 1988 awards were given to four high-level scientific research achievements in the fields of agricultural science, technological science, and material science. The Institute of Botany, Chinese Academy of Sciences, researchers Li Zhensheng, Chen Shuyang, and Xue Wenjiang received the agricultural science award for their new hybrid wheat variety "Xiao Yan 6." The Shanghai Institute of Optics and Fine Mechanics researchers Deng Ximin, Fan Dianyuan, and Yu Wenyan received the technological science award for their "High-Power Laser Physics Experimental Device." The Institute of Physics and Chemistry, Chinese Academy of Sciences, researchers Chen Chuangtian, Wu Bochang, and Jiang Aidong, along with the Institute of Physics researchers Zhao Zhuxian and others, jointly received the material science award for their "Research on High-Temperature Superconductors" and "Theory of Group Effects in Crystal Nonlinear Optics and Exploration of New Nonlinear Optical Materials." Each award comes with a prize of 30,000 yuan.

	These projects either have significant scientific implications or have brought substantial economic benefits to the country, all of which are at the forefront internationally.

	The Chen Jiageng Foundation is a non-profit, private organization established in January 1988. The award committee consists of renowned scholars and experts from both domestic and international backgrounds, as well as representatives from the Chen Jiageng family. Zhou Guangzhao, President of the Chinese Academy of Sciences, serves as the chairman.

	The Chen Jiageng Award follows the Nobel Prize evaluation method, primarily rewarding Chinese scientists who have made outstanding research achievements in the fields of material science, life science, earth science, technological science, agricultural science, and medical science since the founding of the People's Republic of China. This award is given every two years, with no more than three winners per category. The 1988 awards for life science, earth science, and medical science will be announced this year. It is reported that the application process will begin shortly.

	Yan Jici, Song Jian, Zhou Guangzhao, Tang Aoqing, Wang Ganchang, Wang Lianzhang, Wu Lianyuan, Zhang Guoji, Qian Linzhao, and Wu Xiangyu attended the award ceremony. Chen Gongcun, Chen Jiageng's nephew, also flew in from Singapore to attend the ceremony.

　　首届陈嘉庚奖在京颁发
    表彰获世界水平研究成果的科学家
    本报北京一月十七日讯  记者陈祖甲、谢荣镇报道：国内四项高水平的科研成果获得首次“陈嘉庚奖金”，颁奖仪式今天上午在北京科学会堂举行。
    这项以著名爱国华侨领袖陈嘉庚先生命名的奖金，是由陈嘉庚基金会颁发的。一九八八年度的奖金发给农业科学、技术科学和物质科学三个领域的四项研究成果。西北植物所李振声、陈漱阳、薛文江的远缘杂交小麦新品种“小偃六号”获农业科学奖；上海光机所邓锡铭、范滇元、余文炎的“高功率激光物理实验装置”获技术科学奖；福建物构所陈创天、吴伯昌、江爱栋的“晶体非线性光学效应的基团理论和新型非线性光学材料探索”，以及物理所赵忠贤等的“高临界温度超导体研究”并列获物质科学奖。每项奖金三万元。
    这些项目有的具有重大科学意义，有的为国家带来了巨大经济效益，都在国际上处于领先地位。
    陈嘉庚基金会是一个民间的、非盈利的组织，成立于一九八八年一月，评奖委员会由国内外知名学者、专家，以及陈嘉庚家族代表等组成。中科院院长周光召任理事长。
    陈嘉庚奖金参照诺贝尔奖评奖办法，主要奖给建国以后在物质科学、生命科学、地球科学、技术科学、农业科学和医学科学六个领域有突出研究成果的中国科技人才。这项奖每两年评一次，每项获奖者不得超过三人。一九八八年度的生命科学、地球科学和医学奖将在今年评出。据透露，申报工作在近日内开始。
    严济慈、宋健、周光召、唐敖庆、王淦昌、王连铮、武连元、张国基、钱临照、吴相钰专程从新加坡赶来的陈嘉庚的侄子陈共存出席颁奖仪式。
