Someone compares marriage to a cage, those inside want to get out, and those outside want to get in. In fact, it's not just marriage; people seem to always envy each other. You choose a certain lifestyle, which means you must give up other kinds of lifestyles. You don't give up what you don't like, but what you can only choose one of. Everyone's life state always has "this one," thus losing "those ones."

When you were 20, during your first love, you might not have understood: "Everything is for one-time consumption." When you wake up, regret tells you: "No chance to change"; you still feel unwilling, regret tells you: "It's like this"; you protest angrily, regret judges: "It's too late." You graduate from school and receive a job certificate. This small action is enough to constitute a declaration of regret: "You gave up a hundred, a thousand, ten thousand kinds of colorful jobs! You gave up a hundred, a thousand, ten thousand colorful fantasies!"

A person can only have "one" — one life, one footprint. Your every move contains the taste of countless farewells. This is the deepest regret, the essence of life's tragedy.

On the day of a feast, people often say: "How many times can one get drunk in life?" Thus, they raise their cups frequently. You might not like such a toast. It sincerely teaches you to find joy and indulge, letting you feel like you're in heaven, but it also reveals the dark side of life, as if saying: We bury a segment of life with every drink! It directly hits the painful point of reason. Why, during moments of indulgence, can we not forget the heart-wrenching regret?

Youth knows not the taste of sorrow, perhaps because youth does not understand regret, while the toast "How many times can one get drunk in life?" expresses a kind of maturity. Human reason awakens with regret. You become sensible, and you start to regret; the more sensible you are, the more you regret.

In modern society, regret frequently comes at you, newspapers, and television quickly bring news of others' successes. "Why didn't I do it like him?" Whether it's envy, admiration, or remorse, long sighs are all regrets.

For our own happiness, how should we face regret? I recommend you read a story that is currently unfolding, perhaps you can taste a bit of the enlightenment from regret.

British scientists, to prove that humans are not the only beings in the universe, conceived a plan to find extraterrestrials. They identified the "Barnard" star system, which has a sun similar in size, mass, spectrum, and luminosity to ours, and a planet similar to Earth, as the target for Earth's spacecraft. However, to fly there, the spacecraft needs an extremely high speed and tens of thousands of tons of nuclear fuel that the entire Earth can hardly provide. Scientists plan to obtain these fuels from Jupiter, whose cost would be much lower than producing them on Earth. During the construction of the spacecraft, people first transported the components and equipment to the orbit around Jupiter, where they were assembled, tested, and fueled. After launching from Jupiter's orbit, it would still take about 50 years to reach the target, and then report the survey results to Earth using high-power communication equipment. When the "hometown" people receive the message, the researchers, designers, and builders of this spacecraft will no longer be in the world. It is reported that this plan is being seriously carried out.

When you read this story (it started a few years ago), you will deeply regret these scientists. Then, you might gradually understand their fortune. They have a lifelong career; they observe the Barnard star system, 570 million kilometers away, through a telescope. Of course, they do not need to worry like us, calculating gains and losses every day.

You might start to admire this kind of sublime realm. They give their lives a sense of value; they are believers in the lifestyle they have chosen. Devoting oneself to a plan that one cannot see the outcome of, this action itself shows that they are already firmly determined to have "no regrets until death" for their "one footprint."

In the information age, temptations are numerous. If you follow the crowd, you will never be able to get rid of the anxiety and regret of feeling like you've lost something. Only by establishing faith in your own life can you learn to face the loss of various things with philosophical firmness.

Be a believer in your own life! Like a lover cherishes their beloved, like a scientist cherishes the Barnard star system.

　　遗憾的启悟
    刘啸
    有人把婚姻比作笼子，笼里的欲出来，笼外的想进去。其实，岂止是婚姻，人们似乎永远在相互羡慕着。你选择了某种生活方式，就意味着你必须放弃其它样式种类的生活方式；你放弃的并非是你不喜欢的，而是你只能选用一样，每个人的生活状态总是有“这一样”，便丧失“那些样”。
    你２０岁的时候，你初恋的时候，或许还不懂得：“一切仅供消费一次”。当你清醒了，遗憾告诉你：“不容改过”；你仍不甘心，遗憾告诉你：“就这样了”；你愤怒申诉，遗憾便宣判：“为时已晚”。你从学校里毕业出来，领到一纸工作证，这个小小的举动，就足以构成一篇遗憾的宣言：“你放弃了一百、一千、一万种五光十色的职业！你放弃了一百、一千、一万个五彩缤纷的幻想！”
    一个人只能拥有“一”，一次生命、留下一行脚印，你的一举一动都包含无数诀别的味道，这是最深刻的遗憾，是人生悲剧的本质。
    欢宴之日，常有人说：“人生能有几回醉”，于是频频举杯。你也许很不喜欢这样的祝酒，它一面真诚地教你找乐寻欢，纵情豪饮，让你飘飘欲仙，却又一面抽出人生那灰暗的底蕴，仿佛在说：咱们喝一次酒就埋葬了一段人生呀！直楞楞戳向理性的痛点。为何纵情之时，也忘不了那刻骨铭心的遗憾？
    少年不识愁滋味，大概正是少年还不懂得遗憾，而“人生能有几回醉”的祝酒辞，则表达了一种成熟。人类理性正是与遗憾同时觉醒，你懂事了，你就开始遗憾；你愈懂事，你的遗憾愈多。
    现代社会，遗憾更是日益频繁地向你袭来，报纸、电视以最快的速度传来他人成功的消息，“当初我怎么就没像他那样干？”嫉妒也罢，羡慕也罢，悔恨也罢，长嘘短叹皆为遗憾。
    为了自身幸福，我们究竟应该怎样面对遗憾？推荐你读一个正在发生的故事，或许能品味出一点遗憾的启悟。
    英国科学家为了证明人类不是宇宙中的孤儿，设想了一个寻找外星人的计划，他们确定大小、质量、光谱、光度很相似太阳，其行星相似地球的“巴纳德”星系，为地球飞船的目标。可是要飞到那里，飞船需要极高的速度，需要整个地球都难以提供的数万吨核燃料。科学家们计划向木星索取这些燃料，其成本将远低于在地球上制取。在建造飞船时，人们先把构件、设备运送到环绕木星的轨道上，在那里装配、测试、装填燃料，从木星轨道上起飞后，还要飞行约５０年才能到达目标，然后将考察结果用大功率通讯设备向地球报告。当“老家”的人收到消息时，这架飞船的研制者、设计师们都已不在人世了。据悉这项计划正在认真地进行。
    当你读了这个故事（好几年前就开始了），你会为这些科学家深深地遗憾。而后，你是否又渐渐领会到他们的幸运，他们有毕生的事业，他们从天文望远镜中观望５７亿公里之外的巴纳德星系，当然不需要像我们这样成天患得患失，算计恩恩怨怨。
    你或许开始崇尚这种可歌的境界，他们赋予自己的生活一种价值感，他们是自己选定的生活方式的信徒。倾心一项自己见不着结局的计划，这种行为本身就表明他们对自己的“一行脚印”已经具备“至死无憾”的坚定。
    信息时代，诱惑纷繁，倘若人云亦云，人商亦商，你永远也不能摆脱若有所失的焦虑与遗憾。唯有建立对自己生活的信念，才能教你以哲学的坚定去对待失去的五花八门。
    做你自己生活的信徒吧！像热恋者对待情人那样，像科学家对待巴纳德星系那样。
