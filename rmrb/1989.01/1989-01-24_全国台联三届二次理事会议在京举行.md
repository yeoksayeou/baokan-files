A report on the work summary of 1988 and the key points for 1989 was presented by Lin Liyin, president of the All-China Federation of Taiwan Compatriots, for the committee members to review. Lin Liyin said that in the past year, the reform and opening-up on the mainland have been further deepened, and the situation in Taiwan has also undergone a series of changes. The All-China Federation of Taiwan Compatriots has continued to follow the government's policies on Taiwan, adapted to the changing situation in Taiwan, and maintained close contact and exchanges with the people of Taiwan, basically completing the key points of work for 1988 set by the Third National Conference of Returned Overseas Chinese in early 1988, and making active contributions to the cause of national reunification.

At the same time, Lin Liyin pointed out some problems and shortcomings in the work of 1988.

In discussing the key points of work for 1989, Lin Liyin said that 1989 is the tenth anniversary of the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress issuing the "Message to Compatriots in Taiwan." The work of the All-China Federation of Taiwan Compatriots should adapt to the development of the situation, shift the focus of work to the island, fully utilize the characteristics and advantages of the Federation, and carry out liaison work in an all-round, multi-field, multi-level, multi-form, and multi-channel manner.

　　全国台联三届二次理事会议在京举行
    新华社北京１月２３日电（记者王炽）全国台联第三届二次理事会全体会议今天下午在北京举行。
    全国台联会会长林丽韫作１９８８年工作总结及１９８９年工作要点的报告，提请理事们审议。林丽韫说，在过去的一年里，祖国大陆的改革、开放进一步深入，台湾岛内的形势也发生了一系列变化。全国台联继续遵循政府对台方针政策，根据台湾形势的变化，密切与台湾人民的联系与往来，基本上完成了１９８８年初全国台胞第三次代表大会所确定的１９８８年的工作要点，为促进祖国统一大业做出了积极的贡献。
    林丽韫介绍说，１９８８年全国台联接待岛内台胞的数量首次超过接待海外台胞的数量，形成了面对面直接对话交流的新格局；充分发挥了台联会的特点，对来自台湾的各党派、各阶层人士做到“热情相待、提供方便、求同存异、增强共识”，初步建立了与岛内沟通的桥梁；向台湾经济界人士提供咨询服务，帮助解决实际困难，为促进两岸直接通商和吸引台资作出了努力；积极组织两岸文化交流，举办了数场音乐会和摄影、图书展览等活动；积极宣传政府的对台方针政策和大陆建设的新成就；反映大陆台胞返乡探亲的强烈愿望，并使这一愿望得到了台湾人民的广泛同情和支持，促进了两岸的双向探亲；与海外的联谊工作取得了成效。同时，林丽韫指出了１９８８年工作中存在的一些问题和不足。
    在谈到１９８９年的工作要点时，林丽韫说，１９８９年是全国人大常委会发表《告台湾同胞书》十周年。全国台联的工作要适应形势的发展，把工作重心进一步转向岛内，充分发挥台联的特点和优势，全方位、多领域、多层次、多形式、多渠道地开展联谊工作。她强调，台联会要把与台湾人民交流、往来的工作做得更广泛、更深入、更扎实，努力促成双向交流；进一步开展与岛内、海外的经济联系；掌握有利时机，采取多种形式，有针对性地开展对台宣传；调动大陆台胞建设祖国的积极性。
