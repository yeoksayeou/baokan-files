People are generally familiar with the circumstances of Olympic medal winners, but few know the details of Li Huifen's journey to winning the silver medal in the women's singles ping-pong event. She went from being dropped to being selected, traversing a difficult path and finding hope amidst disappointment.

In July of last year, Li Huifen's name was not on the list of athletes selected to participate in the Olympic Games. She faced two choices: either to give up and stop training, or to gather her courage and continue striving for a spot. The only way to prove her capability to compete was through her performance.

"You can't give up, you must hold on. You should participate in the Olympics," said Huijun, a renowned player from the national men's ping-pong team. Huijun's words were not out of sympathy or consolation, but from deep understanding and trust. The two were a devoted couple, and it was their shared love for the small silver ball and their common career that bound their hearts together.

Li Huifen took Huijun's words to heart. Indeed, if she couldn't participate in the Olympics, there was still the 40th World Championships. Huijun was truly a good partner, training himself every day and then accompanying Li Huifen for an additional hour of practice, until he was exhausted and sweating profusely.

On July 22nd of last year, the men's and women's ping-pong teams departed for intensive closed-door training in Weihai, Shandong, and Dandong, Liaoning, respectively, in preparation for the Olympics. Li Huifen and Huijun, as practice partners, accompanied the teams. Before parting, Huijun once again told Li Huifen, "You should go to the Olympics, train hard." Li Huifen looked into his fervent eyes and nodded silently. She didn't know why Huijun was so confident, but she herself had no clear idea.

Upon arriving in Dandong, Li Huifen, though in the role of a practice partner, trained harder than anyone else, especially focusing on improving her technical weaknesses. She felt she had made significant progress.

The month of closed-door training ended quickly. On August 23rd, the women's ping-pong team returned to Beijing from Dandong. After putting down her luggage, Coach Zhang Xianlin convened an emergency meeting for the entire team, announcing the surprising list of athletes selected for the Olympics: Li Huifen, Jiao Zhimin, and Chen Jing. The originally selected He Zili and Dai Lili were dropped. Such a significant change in such a short time caught Li Huifen by surprise as well. However, she finally realized her long-held wish through her unyielding efforts. In the Olympic Games, she helped the Chinese team win one gold medal and one silver medal.

　　希望在争取中
    ——记乒乓球选手李惠芬
    人们对奥运会奖牌得主的情况大都比较熟悉了，然而李惠芬夺取乒乓球女单银牌的内幕却鲜为人知。她从落选到入选，走过了一段艰难的路程，在失望中找到希望。
    去年７月，在上报的参加奥运会选手名单中，没有李惠芬的名字。摆在她面前的道路，一条是泄气收拍不练；另一条是鼓起勇气继续争取入选。能够证明自己有实力参赛的根据，只有用成绩来说话。
    “你这口气不能泄，一定要顶住。你应该参加奥运会。”对她说这话的人是国家乒乓球男队名将惠钧，惠钧说这话，并非出于同情和安慰，而是出于深深的了解和信任。原来，他俩是一对情深意笃的爱侣，是小小银球，共同的事业，把这两颗心紧紧连结在一起。
    李惠芬把惠钧的话牢牢记在心里。是的，奥运会打不成，还有４０届世锦赛，气可鼓不可泄。惠钧真是个好小伙子，每天自己训练完后，还要陪着小李加练一小时，直累得气喘吁吁，大汗淋漓。
    去年７月２２日，男女乒乓球队分别赴山东威海和辽宁丹东进行奥运会前的封闭式强化训练。李惠芬和惠钧作为陪练分别随男女队出发。临别前，惠钧再次对李惠芬说：“你应该去奥运会，好好练。”李惠芬望着他那热辣辣的目光，默默地点点头。她不知道惠钧为什么这样自信，而自己心里却着实没有谱。
    到了丹东，李惠芬虽然充当陪练角色，但练得比谁都刻苦，尤其对自己的技术弱点狠下了一番功夫，自觉足有成效。
    一个月的封闭式训练很快结束。８月２３日，乒乓球女队从丹东拉回北京。刚放下行李，张燮林教练召开全队紧急会议，宣布了令人瞠目的参加奥运会名单：李惠芬、焦志敏、陈静，原定的何智丽、戴丽丽落选了。在这么短的时间内有这么大的变更，连李惠芬自己也感到突然。不过，她终于靠自己的不懈努力，实现了自己的夙愿。在奥运会比赛中，为中国队夺得一块金牌、一块银牌。
