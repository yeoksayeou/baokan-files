Tianjin's arts troupes have begun their reform of the arts system by "slimming down." Up to now, 703 people have left the performance positions in the troupes directly under the jurisdiction of the city, accounting for 29.8% of the total number of personnel.

The long-standing issues of bloated organizations and excess staffing in arts performance troupes have been a major obstacle to their development. To address this problem, the Tianjin Municipal Bureau of Culture has taken the following main measures since 1986: First, it established the Tianjin Municipal Performing Arts Consultative Committee, consisting of more than 60 renowned senior artists and veteran arts workers. After leaving the troupes, these senior artists mainly engage in summarizing experiences, writing books, teaching apprentices, providing consultations and advice for performing arts work, and conducting some demonstration performances. Second, it handled the retirement procedures for 104 performing staff who had reached retirement age. Third, 107 elderly and infirm performing staff, who were not suited to stage work, voluntarily retired early and were paid a five-year retirement salary difference in one lump sum. Fourth, it arranged for 109 people to transfer to other jobs outside the system. Fifth, it placed 324 people within the cultural system to develop the tertiary industry.

At the same time, the Tianjin Municipal Bureau of Culture has implemented various management methods for arts performance troupes. Some troupes have their expenses fully covered, ensuring the necessary conditions for the development of the arts; some adopt a fixed subsidy system, implementing a cost-saving responsibility system; and some operate on an independent accounting basis, bearing their own profits and losses.

After the reform of Tianjin's arts performance troupes, the enthusiasm of the troupes has been stimulated, the morale of cultural workers is relatively stable, and artistic creation is developing steadily.

　　天津文艺团体大幅度“消肿”
    突破人浮于事障碍７０３人离开演出岗位
    新华社天津１月３日电  （记者张淑英）天津市文艺体制改革从“消肿”开始，到目前为止，已有７０３人离开了剧团的演出岗位，占直属艺术表演团体人员总数的２９．８％。
    艺术表演团体长期形成的机构臃肿、人浮于事，是剧团发展的一大障碍。为解决这个问题，天津市文化局１９８６年以来主要采取了如下措施：第一，由６０多位知名的老艺术家和老艺术工作者组成了天津市表演艺术咨询委员会。这些老艺术家离开剧团以后，主要从事总结经验著书立说，收徒传艺，对表演艺术工作提供咨询和建议，进行一些示范演出。第二，给１０４名达到离退休年龄的演职人员办理了离退休手续。第三，１０７名年老体弱、不适应舞台工作的演职人员，在自愿的原则下提前退休，并一次付给５年退休工资差额。第四，妥善安排了１０９人转业外调。第五，在文化系统内安置３２４人兴办第三产业。
    同时，天津市文化局对艺术表演团体实行了多种的管理方法。其中有的经费全包，保证发展艺术事业的必要条件；有的采取定额补贴，实行节约归己的经营承包责任制；有的实行独立核算，自负盈亏。
    天津市艺术表演团体改革后，调动了剧团的积极性，文艺工作者情绪比较稳定，艺术创作稳步发展。
