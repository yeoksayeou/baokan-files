Promoting the Application of Comprehensive Agricultural Science and Technology
The "Harvest Plan" Achieves Another Victory
Implementation Projects Widely Increase Production and Income

Grain, Cotton, Oil, Meat, Poultry, Eggs, and Aquatic Products Increased Production Value by Over 200 Million Yuan Last Year

BEIJING, Jan. 2 (Xinhua) — Despite the fact that grain and cotton crops nationwide were reduced due to natural disasters last year, the "Harvest Plan" projects organized and implemented by the Ministry of Agriculture achieved significant increases in production and income over large areas, demonstrating the enormous potential of promoting and applying comprehensive agricultural science and technology.

Last year marked the second year of the Ministry of Agriculture's implementation of the "Harvest Plan." The ministry signed 21 major contracts and over 1,000 sub-contracts with responsible units. By December 22 last year, the grain, cotton, and oil crop projects had collectively increased grain production by over 2.4 billion kilograms, with an average yield increase of 70 kilograms per mu (0.067 hectares). Cotton production increased by nearly 400 million kilograms. Meat, poultry, eggs, and aquatic products also saw substantial increases in production. The total added value from these increases amounted to 203 million yuan, with an input-output ratio of 1:8.

During the implementation of this plan, numerous examples of large-scale, high-yield production emerged across the country. In Hubei Province, the 1.64 million mu rice-growing area saw an average yield of 514.6 kilograms per mu, a 26.3% increase over the previous three years. In Shandong Province, the 2.15 million mu wheat project achieved an average yield of 398.4 kilograms per mu, a 12% increase. Newly developed or promoted high-quality and specialty products also saw bumper harvests or were widely promoted over large areas.

The "Harvest Plan" effectively combines national and local investments with scientific and technological elements, production materials, and other productive forces, mobilizing the enthusiasm of relevant parties and departments, especially agricultural science and technology personnel. Statistics show that last year, 74,800 science and technology personnel directly participated in the implementation of the national "Harvest Plan." The science and technology personnel of the livestock company in Xing County, Hebei Province, took on the "Meat Rabbit Breed and Its Hybrid Matching Technology Promotion" project. They actively provided farmers with a series of pre- and post-production services, significantly increasing the county's meat rabbit breeding stock from 115,000 at the beginning of the year to 1 million, adding 14 million yuan to farmers' income.

Under the guidance of the national "Harvest Plan," last year, 25 provinces (autonomous regions, municipalities) established their own "Harvest Plans," investing special funds, and covering a planting area of 150 million mu. Shandong Province allocated 10 million yuan from its fiscal budget for the province's "Harvest Plan" projects and rewards. Many places also integrated the "Harvest Plan" with local commercial grain base construction, regional development, and poverty alleviation work, expanding the coverage of scientific and technological promotion.

　　推广应用综合农业科学技术
    农业“丰收计划”再传捷报
    实施项目广为增产增收
    粮棉油肉禽蛋水产品等去年增加产值二十多亿元
    本报北京１月２日讯　新华社记者赵鹏、本报记者萧俊熙报道：去年在全国粮、棉等作物因灾减产的情况下，由农业部组织实施的“丰收计划”项目实现了大面积、大范围增产增收，显示了推广应用综合农业科学技术的巨大作用。
    去年，是农业部组织实施“丰收计划”的第二年，分别与承担单位签订了２１大项、１０００多个承包合同。到去年１２月２２日统计，粮、棉、油等种植业项目共增产粮食２４亿多公斤，平均亩产增加７０公斤；增产棉花近４亿公斤，肉、禽、蛋、水产品等都获得较大幅度增产，共新增产值２０．３亿元，投入产出比为１∶８。
    在实施这项计划中，各地涌现出一大批大范围、大幅度增产的典型。湖北省１６４万亩稻区粮食综合丰产技术项目，平均亩产５１４．６公斤，比前３年平均单产增产２６．３％；山东省２１５万亩小麦项目平均单产达３９８．４公斤，增产１２％。新开发或推广的一些优良、特种产品也都获得丰收或得到大面积、大范围推广。
    丰收计划把国家、地方的投资与科学技术、生产资料等生产力诸要素科学地结合起来，有效地调动了各有关方面和部门特别是农业科技人员的积极性。据统计，去年直接参加实施国家“丰收计划”的科技人员达７．４８万人。河北省井陉县畜牧公司的科技人员承担“肉兔品种及其杂交配套组合技术推广”项目后，积极为农民提供产前产后的系列化服务，全县肉兔饲养量大幅度提高，由年初的１１．５万只增加到１００万只，农民增加收入１４０万元。
    在国家“丰收计划”的带动下，去年共有２５个省（区）、市建立了自己的“丰收计划”，投入专项资金，种植面积达１．５亿亩。山东省财政拨款１００万元用于本省“丰收计划”项目和奖励。许多地方还把“丰收计划”同本地商品粮基地建设、区域开发和扶贫等工作结合起来，扩大了科技推广的覆盖率。
