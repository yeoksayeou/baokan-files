	Beijing Real Estate Exchange Established
	20,000 Square Meters of Commercial Housing to Be Sold Publicly

	Beijing, January 26 (People's Daily) — To promote housing system reform and gradually implement housing commercialization and privatization, the Beijing Real Estate Exchange was officially established on January 23.

	It is reported that in the first half of this year, Beijing will publicly sell 20,000 square meters of commercial housing to urban residents in the Lianhua Garden, Xiluoyuan, and Shizi Po communities. Starting from February 15, these houses will be uniformly registered and presold by the Real Estate Exchange located on Tiantan Road, with a price range of 1,500 to 2,000 yuan per square meter.

	It is understood that in 1988, Beijing completed 1,781 housing transactions, covering an area of 32,600 square meters, with a total transaction value of 209 million yuan. However, problems such as private transactions, reselling, tax evasion, intermediary exploitation, and theft of public housing usage rights have emerged in the real estate circulation sector, seriously disrupting market order.

	The Beijing Real Estate Exchange will organize various real estate parties to trade, act as agents for government agencies, enterprises, and public institutions to buy and rent houses, and organize housing auctions, bidding, and mortgages.

	The responsible person of the Real Estate Exchange said that the relevant competent authorities stipulate that all houses entering the circulation field must undergo market transactions. New commercial houses built by various development companies, old public houses prepared for sale or rent by central, military, Beijing municipal, and district-level units, as well as private houses prepared for sale by individuals, must all be brought to the real estate exchange market for public sale or rent.

　　北京房地产交易所成立    
    二万平方米商品房将公开出售
    本报讯  本报记者廖玒、经济日报记者张子臣报道：为推进住房制度改革，逐步实行住宅商品化、私有化，北京市房地产交易所于１月２３日正式成立。
    据悉，今年上半年，北京市将向城镇居民公开出售莲花园、西罗园、十字坡小区的２万平方米商品房，这些住宅２月１５日起统一由位于天坛路的房地产交易所登记预售，每平方米售价１５００元至２０００元。
    据了解，北京市去年房屋买卖成交１７８１起，面积３．２６万平方米，成交额２．０９亿元，但是，在房地产流通领域也出现了私下交易、倒买倒卖、逃漏税费、中间盘剥、盗卖公房使用权等问题，严重扰乱了市场秩序。
    北京市房地产交易所将组织房地产各方进场交易、为机关企事业单位代购、代租房屋，组织房屋的拍卖、招标、抵押等业务。
    房地产交易负责人说，有关主管部门规定，凡进入流通领域的房屋，必须进行市场交易，各开发公司新建的商品房，中央、军队、北京市属、区属单位准备出卖、出租的旧公房以及私人准备出售的私房，都必须拿到房地产交易市场公开出售或出租。
