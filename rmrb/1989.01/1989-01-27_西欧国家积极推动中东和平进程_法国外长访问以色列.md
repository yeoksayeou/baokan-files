Western European countries are actively promoting the Middle East peace process. French Foreign Minister Roland Dumas visited Israel.

Our reporter Zhang Qi Hua reports from Paris on January 24: French Foreign Minister Roland Dumas conducted a two-day working visit to Israel, during which both sides exchanged views on the Middle East peace issue.

From local reports, it appears that Dumas' visit did not eliminate the differences between the two sides. Shamir insisted on opposing dialogue with the PLO and did not accept an international peace conference convened by the United Nations. Dumas, on the other hand, emphasized that peace can only be achieved through negotiations between the two parties.

Despite this, local opinion holds that Dumas' visit is significant as it is part of Western Europe's efforts to implement its Middle East policy under new circumstances. Western Europe's Middle East policy has long been constrained by the United States. Recently, the United States began dialogue with the PLO, and France seized this opportunity to accelerate the coordination of Middle East policies among Western European countries to jointly promote the Middle East peace process.

In Jerusalem, Dumas met with several prominent Palestinian figures and accepted their invitation to visit the West Bank and the Gaza Strip. Dumas reiterated to the Israeli leadership that the PLO has taken a significant step in recognizing Israel, and that the Middle East peace process has entered a new stage. He stressed that it is now time for Israel and the PLO to engage in dialogue.

Currently, the foreign ministers of France, Spain, and Greece have formed a "trio" to coordinate the Middle East policies of the Community countries.

On January 27, the three foreign ministers will meet with PLO Chairman Arafat in Madrid. They also plan to visit Jordan, Egypt, Syria, and other countries, and then convene a meeting of the 12 foreign ministers of the Community in Madrid on February 14 to discuss and formulate a more comprehensive and specific action plan.

### 西欧国家积极推动中东和平进程  法国外长访问以色列

　　西欧国家积极推动中东和平进程    
    法国外长访问以色列
    本报巴黎１月２４日电  记者张启华报道：法国外长罗朗·迪马对以色列进行了２天工作访问，双方就中东和平问题交换了意见。
    从此间报道看，迪马此行并没有消除双方之间的歧见。沙米尔坚持反对与巴解组织开展对话，也不接受由联合国召开的国际和平会议，而迪马外长强调，和平必须通过双方谈判才能取得。
    尽管如此，此间舆论认为迪马的访问是重要的，它是西欧在新形势下推行中东政策的组成部分。西欧的中东政策长期以来受到美国的制约。不久前，美国开始与巴解对话，法国则利用这一时机，加紧联合西欧国家共同推动中东的和平进程。
    迪马外长在耶路撒冷会见了几位巴勒斯坦著名人士，接受了他们提出的访问约旦河西岸和加沙地带的邀请。迪马外长对以色列领导人重申，巴解在承认以色列问题上已迈出重大的一步，中东和平进入了新阶段，现在应该由以色列和巴解自己去进行对话。
    目前，法国、西班牙、希腊３国外长已组成“三驾马车”，协调共同体国家的中东政策。
    １月２７日，３国外长将在马德里会见巴解主席阿拉法特。他们还计划访问约旦、埃及、叙利亚等国，然后在２月１４日于马德里召开共同体１２国外长会议，商讨制订一个更广泛、具体的行动计划。
