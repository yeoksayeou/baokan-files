Taipei Hosts Exhibition of Mainland Artist Han Meilin's Works

	New China News Agency, Beijing, January 8th: According to the Taiwan United Evening News, an exhibition of ink paintings and ceramic artworks by mainland artist Han Meilin will be held from January 1st to 15th at the Crown Cultural Center in Taipei.

	The report states that in today's Beijing art scene, Han Meilin is a "highly renowned mid-career artist." He has made notable contributions in various fields including painting, ceramics, sculpture, seal carving, dyeing, embroidery, and even paper-cut animation. He has also won the Best Art Award at the Sarajevo Film Festival in Yugoslavia.

	The newspaper also commented that Han Meilin uses bold and free brushstrokes and exaggerated transformations to depict animals, revealing many "touching stories and human emotions."

	It is reported that the Crown Cultural Center in Taipei has also published a promotional brochure and released a signed commentary article. The article believes that Han Meilin's paintings "convey a typical Chinese spirit in terms of brushwork and ink, but in the use of color, they pursue the impressionist style of the West." Using watercolor paper and brushes, he depicts distorted, exaggerated, and "personified" animal images, showcasing his refined and mature artistic skills. "Under his persistent pursuit of modernization, national characteristics, and personal style, he has undoubtedly created a miracle in the animal world."

　　台北举办大陆画家韩美林作品展
    新华社北京１月８日电  据台湾《联合晚报》报道，大陆著名画家韩美林水墨画和陶艺作品展于元月１日至１５日在台北皇冠艺文中心举行。
    报道说，在当今北京画坛中，韩美林是“颇负盛名的中青辈画家，不论在绘画、陶艺、雕塑、篆刻、印染、刺绣，甚至剪纸动画片上都有不错的表现。”他还曾获得南斯拉夫萨格勒布电影节最佳美术奖。
    这家报纸还评论说，韩美林以利落潇洒的笔触、夸张变形的手法描绘动物时，其中隐藏着许多的“感人故事和人间至情”。
    据悉，台北皇冠艺文中心还出版了宣传画册，并发表署名评论文章。文章认为，韩美林的画“在笔墨意趣上，传达了典型的中国精神，但在色彩的运用上，却是对西洋印象派的追求。”他用水彩纸、用毛笔，描绘变形、夸张而“人格化”的动物群象“展现了他洗练、成熟的画艺”。“在他执意追求现代化、民族化和个人风格下，无疑的创造了一个动物世界的奇迹。”
