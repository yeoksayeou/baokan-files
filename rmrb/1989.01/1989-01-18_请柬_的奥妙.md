Recently, my unit received an invitation letter from Yongji County Yonglin High-Tech Artisan Factory in Zhejiang Province, inviting us to participate in their exhibition and order meeting for teaching aids and instrument equipment. The invitation letter clearly states that the order meeting schedule is from November 27, 1988, to December 12, 1988, divided into three phases and held at three locations: Beijing Ancient City Hotel, Hangzhou West Lake Hotel, and Wenzhou Dongou Grand Hotel on Wangjiang Road. To attract customers, the invitation letter openly offers "bait": the organizing committee will arrange accommodation for the attendees, provide free meals, and reimburse transportation costs. They will also organize tours of the Great Wall and the Ming Tombs in Beijing, Huangshan in Anhui, West Lake and Lingyin Temple in Hangzhou, Zhejiang, and Yandang Mountain in Wenzhou. In addition, the meeting will "provide discounts according to the amount of orders placed." After reading this invitation letter, I felt puzzled: the State Council has repeatedly banned using conferences as an excuse to tour famous mountains and rivers, but why does this factory still do as it pleases?

I hope the relevant departments will seriously investigate who supports this practice and how many representatives participated in this tour and order meeting.

　　“请柬”的奥妙
    前不久，我单位收到浙江永嘉县永临高教工艺厂寄来的一份请柬，邀请参加他们举办的教具产品、仪器设备看样定货会。这个请柬上面写明订货会日程是一九八八年十一月二十七日至十二月十二日分三期安排在三个地点：北京市古城旅馆、杭州市西湖饭店、温州市望江路东瓯大厦。为招徕客户，请柬还公开抛出“诱饵”：赴会代表由会务组统一安排住宿、免费用膳、报销车船费；组织游览北京长城、十三陵，安徽的黄山，浙江杭州的西湖、灵隐寺，温州的雁荡山。此外，会上还将“按订货金额多少给予一定比例的优惠”。看了这份请柬，我感到很纳闷：国务院三令五申严禁借开会之机游览名山大川，而这个厂为何仍我行我素？
    希望有关部门认真查一查，是谁支持它这样搞，又有多少代表参加了这个旅游订货会？
