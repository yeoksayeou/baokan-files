The article “A Judge’s Self-Reflection” has sparked significant discussion in society. Many readers have written in to praise the spirit of responsibility shown by Li Xiaozhong, the president of the Fengning Manchu Autonomous County People's Court in Hebei Province, who examined his own work against legal regulations. Some plaintiffs have also written in to express their frustration that their cases have not been accepted or have been delayed for a long time.

Errors in work always have causes. They may be subjective, objective, or a combination of both. Regardless of the cause, they should not be used as an excuse for not fulfilling one's duties. The postal service cannot justify long-term mail backlogs by citing increased mail volume, and the transportation department cannot justify long-term delays in solving transportation issues by citing increased passenger flow. Civil cases directly affect the immediate interests of the parties involved and cannot be delayed indefinitely. Finding ways to meet social needs and help the people solve their problems is the unshirkable responsibility of every department and unit. The courts cannot justify long-term case backlogs by citing a lack of personnel or other reasons. As the deputy head of the Zhaoling Court put it, “We talk about public service consciousness and service awareness every day. If we were the plaintiffs, could we tolerate a public servant who delays cases?”

It is gratifying that the Intermediate People's Court of Chengde Region and the Fengning Manchu Autonomous County Party Committee did not try to cover up the issues raised in the letter, but instead publicly circulated it, requiring the judicial departments to take it seriously. We commend the Intermediate People's Court of Chengde Region and the Fengning County Committee for their attitude of taking responsibility for the law and the people. At the same time, we hope that while strengthening the ideological construction of the police force, they will also adopt a spirit of reform to establish and improve work systems, fundamentally solving the problems of difficulties in filing complaints and low case-handling efficiency.

　　应对法律和人民负责

    《一位法官的自责》，在社会上引起了很大反响。许多读者来信热情赞扬河北省丰宁满族自治县法院院长李晓中对照法律规定检查自己工作的负责精神。也有一些当事人来信反映他们的案子无人受理，或久拖不办的苦恼。
    工作上出现差错，总是有原因的。或者是主观的，或者是客观的，或者是兼而有之。但不管是什么原因，都不应成为自己不履行职责的理由。邮政部门不能因为邮件增多而长期积压邮件，交通客运部门也不能因为客流量剧增而长期不解决乘车难的问题，民事案件直接关系到当事人切身利益，更不能久拖不办。想方设法满足社会需要，为群众排忧解难，是一切部门、单位责无旁贷的工作。法院不能因为办案人手紧或其它什么原因，就心安理得地长期积压案件。正如窄岭法庭副庭长所说的那样：“我们天天在讲公仆意识和服务观念，假如我们自己是当事人，难道能容忍拖延办案的公仆吗？”
    令人高兴的是，承德地区中级人民法院和丰宁满族自治县党委并没有因这封信会将家丑外扬而加以掩盖，而是公开转发，要求政法部门认真对待。我们对承德地区中级人民法院和丰宁县委的这种对法律、对人民负责的态度表示赞赏，同时也期望他们在加强干警队伍思想建设的同时，能以改革的精神，建立、健全工作制度，从根本上解决群众告状难、办案效率低的问题。
