She was the owner of many hardcover books. Whenever she walked down the street, she always carried a hardcover book: thick, with a plastic-covered jacket, and a gold-embossed spine. In her dormitory, there was a small, elegant bookshelf, neatly arranged with hardcover books...

She was beautiful, with a unique elegance. She dressed modestly yet elegantly, always in high-quality fabrics. Her high-bridged nose always had a pair of silver-framed glasses perched on it. She walked with a book tucked under her arm, her chest held high, her head held up, and her red high-heeled shoes clicking on the cement pavement. People often mistook her for a highly educated young woman or a female college student.

They met while browsing for books. She bought a hardcover classic literary masterpiece. The next day, he asked her if she had finished the book. She said she had. She said: "This book is boring."

Later, he discovered that her evaluation of every book was: "This book is boring."

Finally, he visited her dormitory and saw her bookshelf. Ah, it was filled with books from various disciplines, their contents so chaotic that it was hard to tell what subjects she was interested in. Was she a true polymath?! When he pulled out one book after another—*Calculus*, *Astrophysics*, *Human Body Art Aesthetics*—and asked her about them, her response was still: "Boring." When he wrote her name in cursive on a piece of paper, she couldn't even recognize it...

Later, he finally found out: she worked in a textile factory as a female worker and was illiterate.

Yet, he could still see her going to the bookstore to buy hardcover books. She never carried a wallet; when paying, she always took the money out from the plastic cover of the hardcover book she carried under her arm...

He loved roses and had planted many on his balcony. But what attracted him was the rose bush on the balcony directly opposite. It was a charming, colorful flower balcony, blooming all year round, unaffected by the scorching heat or the cold winter!

He didn't understand how the owner could so meticulously cultivate such beautiful roses?

The owner of the flower balcony was a charming young lady. He often saw her tending to the roses on the balcony, spraying water on the flowers. Her serious demeanor showed that she was completely captivated by the strange and beautiful flowers...

He had the idea of visiting her to learn about flower cultivation, but he never acted on it. Because, he felt that she was a flirtatious woman. He saw the men who frequently accompanied her in and out, and he also heard the noisy conversations between men and women coming from her room at night... One day, as he passed by the flower stand, a sudden gust of wind blew, and he heard a crashing sound. A potted rose from her balcony had fallen and broken in front of him. He recognized it as the precious, rare flower he had admired so much. Its colors were so rich and vibrant, and its blooms were so lush and abundant. What a pity!

He quickly bent down to pick up the flowers. But he was suddenly stunned. The flowers were fake, made of plastic, with no life or vitality!

"Are all your flowers fake?" he asked the lady who came down to pick up the flowers.

"Is life always real...?" she looked straight at him.

The young man, besides his talent, had almost nothing. The young woman, however, almost had everything that a modern person could have, including a "three-bedroom one-living room" apartment furnished in a modern style, and all the modern things that should be placed in such a home. Because, she worked in a highly enviable company. At the same time, she had even more enviable beauty. They loved each other deeply and had decided to cultivate beautiful seedlings in the garden of love, letting spring stay in their lives forever...

How many times had she whispered in his ear: "I love you, love you, love you..."

And he was intoxicated by this passionate love, feeling that he was a very rich man...

Suddenly, she had to go on a business trip at the manager's request to complete a major deal, to deal with a powerful figure. She was gone for many days, and he received a letter: "For the sake of the company's interests, including my own, I must get married. This is the manager's instruction, and I have followed it." Thus, she had an ugly husband, but she was richer than before.

On the street, he met her, and she only had one sentence: "In the transactions of life, there are always true and false elements..."

　　陋斑素描
    那家伦
    她是一本本精装书的主人。走上街头，她总是夹着一本精装的书：厚厚的，封面包塑皮的，书脊烫金的。她的寝室里，有一个精致的小书架，架上规整地排列着一本本精装的书……
    她很美，别有一番高雅的风韵。穿着大方而又素净，衣服质料都是高档的。她那高挺的鼻梁上总是一副银框眼镜。她夹书，挺胸，昂首，用那双红皮高跟鞋敲响水泥地面时，人们常以为遇到的是极有学问的姑娘，或是一个女大学生。
    他们是挤在一起购书相识的。她买的，是一部精装的古典文学名著。过了一天，他问她书看完了么？她说看完了。她说：这本书没劲。
    后来，他发现她对每本书的评价都是：“这本书没劲。”
    他终于到了她的寝室，见到了她的书架，呵，上面排列着各种学科的书，其内容杂乱到简直不明白主人到底对什么学问感兴趣。她是真正的杂家？！当他由架上抽出一本本《微积分》、《天体物理》、《人体艺术美学》……询问她时，她的回答仍是：“没劲。”当他用草体在纸上写下她的姓名时，她竟然辨认不出……
    后来，他终于打听清楚了：她在某纺织厂做女工，是个文盲。
    然而，仍然能看到她前往书店购买精装本的书。她是从不带钱夹的，付款时，总由腋下的精装书的塑套里取出钱来……　　　　
    　爱月季的他在阳台上种了许多月季。可吸引他的却是斜对面阳台上的月季花丛。那是一个迷人的色彩斑斓的花的阳台，四季常开不败，不惧酷暑严寒！
    他不明白，主人是用什么办法精心养育出这么精美的月季的？
    鲜花阳台的主人，是一位娇美的小姐。他常见她在阳台上伺弄月季，喷淋花水。那极认真的样儿，显示出她完全被奇花异卉陶醉的神情……
    他有过登门讨教花经的念头，可都未成行。因为，他感觉到那是一位风流的女士。他看到如走马灯一般替换得很勤的与她出入的男人，也听到深夜由她屋内传出的男女喧闹的声音……这天，路过花台下，恰遇一阵大风刮过，只听一阵响动，她阳台上的一盆月季已经摔破在他脚前。他熟识这正是他极为动心的那盆珍贵的奇花，它的色彩富丽得惹人，它的花团硕富得惊人。多可惜呵！
    他急忙走上前去，弯腰把花儿拣拾起来。然而，他顿刻呆住了。这花，是假的，是塑料的，它们毫无生气，没有一点生命的灵光！
    “难道你的花都是假的？”他问下楼拣花的女士。
    “难道生活都是真的……？”她直望着他。　　　　　
    年轻的他，除了他的才华，几乎一无所有。同样年轻的她，却几乎拥有按现代方式装修的“三室一厅”和应当置于厅室中的现代的一切，因为，她在一家令人羡慕的公司工作。同时，她还有更令人羡慕的美。他们爱得深极了，已经决定在爱情的园圃里培植起美好的株苗，让春天长驻于生活中……
    她多少次对着他的耳朵喃喃低语说：我爱你，爱你，爱你……
    而他也陶醉在这种炽热的感情里，动心地感到自己是个极富有的人……
    突然她应经理之召，要去完成一笔重大的交易，去对付一个有权势的人物。一去多日，他等来一封信：“为了公司的利益，也包括我的利益，我必须出嫁。这是经理的嘱告，我听了。”于是，她有了一个奇丑的丈夫，然而她比以前更富有。
    在街头，他遇过她，她仅有一句话：“在生活的交易中，原本就真真假假……”
