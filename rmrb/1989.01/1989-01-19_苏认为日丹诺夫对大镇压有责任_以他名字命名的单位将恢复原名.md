The Soviet Union believes that former party and state leader Zhdanov was one of the organizers of the large-scale suppression of innocent Soviet citizens in the 1930s and 1940s and bears responsibility for the crimes committed at that time. Therefore, cities, towns, streets, enterprises, schools, and military units named after him will revert to their original names.

Zhdanov (1896-1948) once served as the secretary of the Leningrad Oblast and city committees of the All-Union Communist Party (Bolsheviks), the secretary of the Central Committee in charge of ideological work, and a member of the Politburo.

According to a report by TASS today, the Central Committee of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union has proposed to the Presidium of the Supreme Soviet of the USSR, the Council of Ministers, the relevant authorities of the union republics, and local governments to revoke the decisions made at different times to name places and institutions after Zhdanov.

　　苏认为日丹诺夫对大镇压有责任
    以他名字命名的单位将恢复原名
    新华社莫斯科１月１７日电  苏联前党和国家领导人日丹诺夫被认为是３０—４０年代大规模镇压苏联无辜公民的组织者之一，对当时犯下的罪行负有责任，因此以他的名字命名的城市、村镇、街道、企业、学校和部队将恢复原先的名称。
    日丹诺夫（１８９６—１９４８）曾任联共（布）列宁格勒州委和市委书记、负责意识形态工作的党中央书记和政治局委员。
    据塔斯社今天报道，苏共中央已建议苏联最高苏维埃主席团、部长会议、各加盟共和国相应机构和地方当局撤消在不同时期发布的以日丹诺夫名字命名的决定。
