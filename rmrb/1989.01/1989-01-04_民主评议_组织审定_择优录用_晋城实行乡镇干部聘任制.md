Democratic Evaluation, Organizational Approval, Selective Employment

Jincheng Implements Township Official Placement System

People's Daily reports: The suburbs of Jincheng City in Shanxi Province have implemented a placement system for general township officials. Currently, 208 positions have been merged, accounting for 23% of the original positions; 439 general officials have been streamlined, accounting for 39% of the total number of officials.

The suburbs of Jincheng City have 26 townships, with overlapping organizational structures and excessive personnel. Since last year, the suburban district committee has decided to implement a placement system for general township officials, which involves defining positions and jobs, delivering speeches, democratic evaluation, organizational approval, and then selecting the best for placement.

They have placed the entire process of implementing the placement system under the supervision of the masses, ensuring that the competition goals and conditions, procedures and methods, evaluation results, and placement outcomes are all made public.

　　民主评议　组织审定　择优录用
    晋城实行乡镇干部聘任制
    本报讯  山西省晋城市郊区对乡镇一般干部实行聘任制。目前，已裁并岗位２０８个，占原设岗位的２３％；精简一般干部４３９名，占干部总数的３９％。
    晋城郊区有２６个乡镇，机关编制重叠，人浮于事。去年以来，郊区区委决定对乡镇一般干部实行聘任制，即通过定岗定职，述职讲演，民主评议，组织审定，然后择优聘任。
    他们把聘任制实施的过程全部置于群众的监督之下，做到竞争目标和条件公开，程序和方法公开，评议成绩公开，聘任结果公开。
