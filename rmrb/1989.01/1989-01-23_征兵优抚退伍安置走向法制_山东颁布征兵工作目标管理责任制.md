Military Enlistment, Preferential Treatment, and Demobilization Towards Legalization: Shandong Issues Military Enlistment Work Target Management Responsibility System

People's Daily reports: On January 20, Shandong Province, known as a "major contributor of soldiers," issued the "Military Enlistment Work Target Management Responsibility System" based on the "Law of the People's Republic of China on National Defense" and the "Regulations on Military Enlistment." This move aims to lay a solid foundation for ensuring the quality of this year's military enlistment. Recently, the General Staff Department of the People's Liberation Army has promoted their practices nationwide.

During the preparation for this spring's military enlistment, Shandong Province focused on six key tasks. First, they formulated local regulations for military enlistment and issued the "Shandong Province Military Enlistment Work Target Management Responsibility System." This system clearly outlines the management targets, performance standards, division of responsibilities, and reward and punishment measures for the provincial, municipal (prefectural), county, and township governments, as well as the relevant departments such as the military, public security, health, civil affairs, and propaganda. Second, they convened a military enlistment work conference to conduct enlistment education. Third, they drafted military enlistment work agreements and new soldier quality responsibility cards. Fourth, they improved the preferential treatment policies for conscripted soldiers, linking the treatment standards with their performance in the army. Fifth, they established a public supervision system for the quality of new soldiers. Each level of the enlistment organization set up a complaint box, and after the final selection of soldiers, the list of new soldiers was publicly posted, encouraging the public to supervise and evaluate. Sixth, the military enlistment departments strengthened cooperation with the receiving units, forming a combined force for enlistment and reception.

　　征兵优抚退伍安置走向法制    
    山东颁布征兵工作目标管理责任制
    本报讯  １月２０日，被誉为“出兵大户”的山东省，依据《兵役法》和《征兵工作条例》，颁布了《征兵工作目标管理责任制》，为确保今年征兵质量打下坚实的基础。日前，人民解放军总参谋部在全国推广了他们的做法。
    在今春征兵准备工作中，山东省主要办了六件事。一是制定征兵工作地方性法规，颁布了《山东省征兵工作目标管理责任制》。对省、市（地）、县、乡四级人民政府和人武、公安、卫生、民政、宣传等有关部门的征兵管理目标、达标措施、责任分工、奖惩办法作了明确的条文规定。二是召开征兵工作会议，搞好征兵教育。三是制订征兵工作协议书和新兵质量责任卡。四是完善了义务兵优待政策，把优待标准与其在部队的实绩挂起钩来。五是健全新兵质量公开监督制度。各级征兵机构设立举报信箱，定兵后新兵名单张榜公布，发动群众监督评议。六是兵役机关加强同接兵部队合作，形成征接合力。
