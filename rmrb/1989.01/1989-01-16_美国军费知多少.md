According to the U.S. Department of Defense budget released on January 9, the military expenditure for the fiscal years 1990 to 1994 totals 1.7 trillion dollars. Of this, the military budget for the 1990 fiscal year (October 1, 1989 to September 30, 1990) is 315.2 billion dollars (including the Department of Energy's budget related to nuclear weapons), an increase of 16 billion dollars over the current fiscal year (1989). According to this budget, the 1990 fiscal year's military expenditure, after adjusting for inflation, will increase by 2%.

The U.S. military expenditure peaked in the early 1980s, with annual growth rates ranging from 5% to 14% between 1981 and 1985. However, as U.S. newspapers have noted, this golden age has passed. Many members of Congress believe that to gradually balance the federal budget deficit, military spending should at least remain at current levels, meaning a growth rate of zero after adjusting for inflation. This would reduce military spending by 96 billion dollars over the 1990 to 1994 fiscal years.

Some critics of the Pentagon point out that spending on new weapons projects should be reduced. For example, the B-2 stealth bomber planned for production this year costs 5.2 billion dollars per aircraft, the SSN-21 attack submarine costs 1 billion dollars per vessel, and the C-17 new transport aircraft costs 1.2 billion dollars per aircraft, among others. The 1990 fiscal year's expenditure on the "Star Wars" program is 5.9 billion dollars, approximately 50% higher than in 1989. Representative Les Aspin said that before Congress can do its work, we still need to see how the defense budget will be under President Bush. It seems that there will be a debate on military spending within the United States.

　　美国军费知多少
    据１月９日发表的美国国防部预算，１９９０至１９９４财政年度，５年的军费共计１．７万亿美元，其中１９９０财政年度（１９８９年１０月１日—１９９０年９月３０日）的军费为３１５２亿美元（包括能源部有关核武器的预算），比本财政年度（１９８９年度）多１６０亿美元。按照这一预算，１９９０年度的军费在扣除通货膨胀因素之后，实际增长２％。
    美国军费开支在８０年代前期达到高峰，１９８１至１９８５年度每年增长幅度在５％至１４％之间。但正如美国报纸所说，这种黄金时代已经过去。许多国会议员认为，为了使联邦财政赤字逐步走向平衡，军费至少应停留在现有水平上，即在扣除通货膨胀因素之后增长率为零，这样１９９０至１９９４年度的军费可以减少９６０亿美元。
    一些批评五角大楼的人士指出，应该减少那些花钱多的新武器项目，例如今年计划生产的Ｂ—２隐形飞机每架要花５２亿美元，ＳＳＮ—２１攻击潜艇每艘１０亿美元，Ｃ—１７新式运输机每架１．２亿美元等等。１９９０年度用于“星球大战”计划的费用５９亿美元，比１９８９年度大约高出５０％。众议员阿斯平说，在国会能进行工作之前，我们还得看看布什任总统后的国防预算将会怎样。看来在军费问题上，美国国内将会有一场争论。　　　　　　（张启昕）
