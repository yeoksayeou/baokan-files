China's agricultural comprehensive development, aimed at pushing the country's agriculture to a new level, made significant progress in 1988. Today, Vice Premier Tian Jiyun chaired a meeting of the State Land Development Fund Management Leading Group, summarizing experiences and deploying near-term agricultural development work.

Last year, the state designated seven key areas for agricultural comprehensive development: the Huang-Huai-Hai Plain, the Sanjiang Plain, the sugar and cotton bases in Guangxi and Xinjiang, and others. These areas span 11 provinces and autonomous regions, including Heilongjiang, Jilin, Liaoning, Shandong, Henan, Hebei, Jiangsu, Anhui, Xinjiang, Guangxi, and Yunnan. The work progressed rapidly. Relevant provinces and autonomous regions strengthened their leadership of agricultural development, formulated overall plans and annual implementation plans. According to statistics from 10 provinces and autonomous regions, 1.954 billion yuan was allocated for agricultural comprehensive development in 1988, with local matching funds accounting for 50.9%. These provinces and autonomous regions planned to transform 13.14 million mu of medium and low-yield fields in 1988. By early December last year, 11.36 million mu had started construction, with 5.98 million mu already completed, accounting for 45.5% of the planned transformation area. They planned to reclaimed 2.65 million mu of arable wasteland, with 3.41 million mu starting construction, and 2.83 million mu already completed, exceeding the plan by 6.9%.

Vice Premier Tian Jiyun gave a speech titled "Determine to Push Agricultural Development Forward." He said that fully and effectively utilizing China's agricultural resources and carrying out large-scale agricultural comprehensive development is a strategic measure to achieve the agricultural development goals by the end of the century and to ensure the sustained and stable development of China's agriculture. It is also a new task and the hope for developing China's agriculture. If done well, it will create a new situation for China's agriculture. The significance of this matter must be fully recognized and highly valued, and it must not be underestimated.

He pointed out that whether from the perspective of some regions or from the national perspective, agricultural comprehensive development is inevitable and has great potential. First, there is great potential; second, the conditions are good; third, cadres and the masses are enthusiastic, and the understanding is consistent. Now it depends on whether we have the will, the determination, and the courage to lead and organize the masses to do this work. He said that from now on, we must put agricultural comprehensive development on the agenda. We must make a great effort, with strong will, to vigorously promote the development of agricultural resources, and we must persist and achieve results to meet the needs of the Four Modernizations, the improving living standards of the people, and the needs of reform and opening up.

This meeting preliminarily determined the plan for agricultural development in the coming year and the near term, which will be quickly negotiated with relevant provinces and autonomous regions, formulate specific plans, and implement them.

Leaders from the State Planning Commission, Ministry of Agriculture, Ministry of Water Resources, State Forestry Administration, Ministry of Finance, Ministry of Materials, State Land Administration, Agricultural Bank of China, State Council Rural Development Research Center, Chinese Academy of Sciences, and Chinese Academy of Agricultural Sciences attended the meeting.

　　我国农业综合开发大有可为
    去年改造中低产田近６００万亩开荒２８０多万亩
    田纪云部署近期工作强调持之以恒抓出成效
    新华社北京１月４日电  （记者黄正根）促使我国农业再登上一个新台阶的农业综合开发，１９８８年取得可喜进展。今天，国务院副总理田纪云主持召开国家土地开发基金管理领导小组会议，在总结经验的基础上，部署近期农业开发工作。
    去年，被国家列为重点农业综合开发的有黄淮海平原、三江平原、广西和新疆糖棉基地等七大片，范围涉及黑龙江、吉林、辽宁、山东、河南、河北、江苏、安徽、新疆、广西、云南等１１个省、区。这项工作进展较快。有关省、自治区都切实加强了对农业开发工作的领导，制定了开发的总体规划和年度实施计划。据１０个省、区的统计，１９８８年已落实用于农业综合开发的投资达１９．５４亿元，其中地方配套投资占５０．９％。这些省、区，１９８８年计划改造中低产田１３１４万亩，截至去年１２月初开工面积为１１３６万亩，其中已改造完５９８万亩，占计划改造面积的４５．５％；计划开垦宜农荒地２６５万亩，已开工面积为３４１万亩，其中已完成２８３万亩，超过计划６．９％。
    田纪云副总理在会上作了《下决心把农业开发搞上去》的讲话。他说，更充分、更有效地利用我国的农业资源，进行大规模的农业综合开发，是实现本世纪末农业发展目标，保持我国农业持续稳定发展的一项战略性措施，也是一项新的任务，是发展我国农业的希望所在。搞得好，就会使我国农业开创一个新的局面。对这件事的意义，一定要充分认识，高度重视，决不要低估。
    他指出，不论从一些地区看，还是从全国看，农业综合开发是势在必行，也大有可为。一是潜力很大，二是条件较好，三是干部、群众都有积极性，上下认识一致。现在就看我们有没有毅力，有没有决心，有没有魄力去领导群众、组织群众干这番事业。他说，我们从现在开始，就必须把农业综合开发提到议事日程上来。要下大的决心，以坚强的毅力，大抓狠抓农业资源的开发，而且要持之以恒，抓出成效，以适应四化建设的需要，适应人民生活逐步改善的需要，适应改革、开放的需要。
    这次会议初步确定了今年和近期农业开发的方案，将尽快与有关省、区协商后，制定具体规划，付诸实施。
    国家计委、农业部、水利部、林业部、财政部、物资部、国家土地管理局、中国农业银行、国务院农村发展研究中心、中国科学院、中国农科院的领导同志，出席了会议。
