The "Guotao Cup" International Women's Football Tournament, sponsored by the Xiamen International Trade Trust Company with an investment of 5 million yuan and organized by the Chinese Football Association, was the first international competition held in China this year. Some have concluded: it cost a lot but the level was low, the audience was sparse, and there were complaints all around!

The 9-day competition showed that this conclusion was not off the mark. The six participating teams had varying levels of skill. The strongest teams, China and Finland, were at best second-tier internationally; the Japanese team and the Fujian team were at the provincial level; the Xiamen team and the Philippine Makati team, despite each borrowing five players from the Chinese national team and the Fujian provincial team respectively, still could not compete with the aforementioned four teams. The relevant authorities did not even send an invitation to the Thai team.

In a country like ours, where the economy is still relatively backward, to spend so much money on such a low-level international competition is obviously more harmful than beneficial. Even some of the event's staff believed that such a competition had little social benefit and even less economic value. The Xiamen International Trade Trust Company was criticized by public opinion. The Chinese Football Association, as the main organizer, did not even send a single representative to the event.

Sports are not just the responsibility of the sports department, but they should not be entirely pushed onto society under the pretext of promoting social involvement in sports. The sports department should first truly value and respect socially organized sports, avoid hasty and superficial approaches, and not just go through the motions.

　　五十万元买来的教训
    ——厦门国际女足赛效果不佳
    由厦门国际贸易信托公司出资５０万、中国足协衔头承办的“国贸杯”国际女子足球赛，是我国今年头一项国际比赛。有人给它下了结论：花钱不少，水平不高，观众寥寥，怨声载道！
    历时９天的比赛表明，人们的这一结论并未下错。参赛的６个队水平参差不齐。最强的中国队、芬兰队，充其量是世界二流队；日本队、福建队属省级队水准；厦门队和菲律宾马基沓队虽分别从中国队和福建省队各借调了５名队员，但仍无法与上述４个队抗衡。有关单位压根就未给泰国队发邀请。
    在我们这样经济还较落后的国家，兴师动众地花这么多钱举办如此低水平的国际比赛，显然是弊大于利。就连赛会一些工作人员也认为，这样的比赛社会效益收效不大，经济效益就更不值了。厦门国际贸易信托公司因此遭到社会舆论的奚落。作为主办单位的中国足协竟无一人亲临赛会。
    体育不是体育部门一家的事，但也不应该以提倡社会办体育为由，全部推给社会。体育部门首先要真正重视、尊重社会办体育，不要急功近利，搞花架子。
