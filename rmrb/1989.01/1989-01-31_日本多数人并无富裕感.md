Japan claims to be a "super economic power," with a per capita national income surpassing that of the United States. However, the majority of Japanese people do not feel wealthy.

The results of the first "Public Opinion Survey on Economic Structural Adjustment" released by the Japanese Prime Minister's Office today indicate that 22.4% of people feel they are living a lifestyle befitting a major economic power. These people are mainly in their 20s and over 70 years old. However, 69.2% of people do not have this feeling. The reasons include heavy tax and social insurance burdens, low personal income compared to national income, long working hours, and high prices compared to other countries.

Japanese people, including employees of large companies and government officials, generally feel short of money. However, large enterprises hold vast amounts of capital, such as huge trade surpluses, foreign debts, and foreign investments. Unequal distribution of social wealth is one of Japan's social problems.

　　日本多数人并无富裕感
    新华社东京１月２９日电  日本自称是“超级经济大国”，人均国民总产值超过了美国，但是多数日本人并没有富裕感。
    日本总理府今天公布的第一次“关于经济结构调整的民意测验”结果表明，２２．４％的人觉得自己过上了和世界经济大国相应的生活，这些人主要是２０多岁的年轻人和７０岁以上的老年人。然而６９．２％的人却没有这种实感，原因是日本的税收和社会保险费负担沉重，与国民总产值相比，个人收入低微，劳动时间长，物价比外国昂贵。
    日本人，包括大公司的职员、政府机关工作人员在内，普遍感到缺钱，但是在大企业的手中握有巨额资金，例如庞大的外贸盈余、对外债权、对外投资等。社会财富不平均，是日本的社会问题之一。
