Ten young women from Jingyang Ridge have been battling saline-alkali land for over six years, contributing 200,000 kilograms of grain and cotton to the nation.

According to Xinhua News Agency (reporters Li Daoman and Wang Zhiyun), ten young women from Shandong's Yanggu County have transformed a barren saline-alkali land into a productive area over the course of six years, contributing 200,000 kilograms of grain and cotton to the state.

Jingyang Ridge, as depicted in the classic novel "Water Margin," is described as a dense forest teeming with wild beasts. However, in reality, the area is sparsely wooded, with vast stretches of white, saline-alkali land. Six years ago, Li Suzhen and nine other young women from Jingyang Ridge volunteered to take on the task of reclaiming a piece of saline-alkali land known as "E Duck Slope." The young women formed a collective and set up a thatched hut on the edge of the saline-alkali land, beginning their battle to transform the barren land.

Six years have passed, and the ten young women have successfully changed the face of the saline-alkali land. Today, they have created assets worth 600,000 yuan, acquired tractors, flour mills, and water pumps, built ten new brick houses, and even purchased a large color television. The Communist Youth League Central Committee has awarded the collective the honorary title of "Advanced Collective."

　　景阳岗十姑娘苦战盐碱滩
    六年交售粮棉二十万公斤
    据新华社电  （通讯员李道满、记者王志耘）山东阳谷县景阳岗十位姑娘在盐碱滩上苦战六年多，在不毛之地为国家献出了二十万公斤粮棉。
    景阳岗在长篇历史小说《水浒传》里被描写成树茂林深、野兽出没之地，可今日实际上林木稀少，有的地方是白茫茫的盐碱滩。六年前，住在景阳岗下的李素贞等十位姑娘主动向村里申请，承包治理被称为“鹅鸭坡”的一片盐碱滩。姑娘们组成了“集体户”，在盐碱地边搭起茅屋，开始了治碱改地的鏖战。
    六年的岁月过去了，十位姑娘终于改变了盐碱滩的面貌。如今，她们创造了六十万元的资产，有了拖拉机、磨面机、抽水机，十间新盖的砖房，还添置了大彩电。共青团中央对十位姑娘的集体授予了“先进集体”荣誉称号。
