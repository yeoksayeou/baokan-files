For the reconstruction of the Nara Saidaiji wooden pagoda in Japan, Shaanxi Province has provided a design scheme and model.

Xinhua News Agency and People's Daily reporters Wang Zhaolin and Meng Xian report from Xi'an on January 29: The design scheme and model for the reconstruction of the Nara Saidaiji wooden pagoda in Japan, created by the Shaanxi Provincial Cultural Relics Bureau, were approved by experts in Xi'an on January 28.

Over 1,000 years ago, during the Tang Dynasty, Nara frequently engaged in cultural exchanges with China. The Saidaiji Temple was established in 764 AD and is the origin of the Shingon Ritsu sect of Japanese Buddhism. The temple's architecture absorbed the style of Tang Dynasty buildings, with two pagodas, east and west, which were later destroyed, leaving only the base of the eastern pagoda.

The reconstruction plan for the eastern pagoda of Saidaiji Temple, undertaken by the Shaanxi Provincial Cultural Relics Bureau, referenced Tang Dynasty tomb murals, Dunhuang murals, as well as the Small Wild Goose Pagoda in Xi'an and the wooden pagoda in Ying County, Shanxi. The bureau also organized craftsmen with rich experience and technical skills in ancient architecture to create two models scaled down to 1/30 according to the design drawings.

　　为重建日本奈良西大寺木塔  陕西省提供设计方案和模型
    本报西安１月２９日电  新华社记者王兆麟、本报记者孟西安报道：陕西省文物局为日本重建奈良市西大寺木塔所作的设计方案及制作模型，于２８日在西安通过了专家评审。
    在１０００多年前的唐代，奈良曾与中国进行频繁的文化交流。奈良西大寺创建于公元７６４年，是日本佛教真言律宗的发源地，其建筑吸收了唐代建筑的风格，寺内有东、西两塔，后被毁，只保存了东塔基座。
    由陕西省文物局承担的西大寺东塔重修方案，设计时参考了唐墓中的壁画建筑和敦煌壁画，以及西安小雁塔、山西应县木塔等。文物局同时组织了具有丰富古建筑经验和技术的工匠，按设计图纸制作了缩小为１／３０的两个模型。
