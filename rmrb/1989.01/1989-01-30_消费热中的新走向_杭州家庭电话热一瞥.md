	Consumers' Fever: New Trends
		—A Glimpse at the Telephone Craze in Hangzhou Households
		People's Daily Reporter Gao Haihao

	“Hey, guess where I’m calling from? Right here at home!” Just after the New Year, an acquaintance called to wish me a happy new year. He is a worker at a factory in Hangzhou.

	“Do you have any connections? Help me get a phone installed at home. I’ve already prepared the 1,000 yuan installation fee.” Almost on the same day, another acquaintance made his first request of the new year. He is an ordinary staff member at a provincial-level organization.

	“Hangzhou is once again swept by a telephone craze”—local media exclaimed in surprise. Some people also say that having a phone at home has become as popular and in demand as color TVs, housing, and liquefied gas.

	Another “hotspot”! People have had enough of chasing trends and seem to be unable to bear any more “fever.” But what will this “home telephone craze” bring?

	In a provincial-level organization compound, while leaders are racking their brains over which level of officials can enjoy free installation of home telephones, their subordinates have already paid out of their own pockets to quietly bring dozens of telephone lines into their homes. An organizational staff member said: Having a phone at home was once a symbol of official rank and later became a symbol of being a “millionaire.” Now that telephones can enter ordinary households, it reflects social equality and progress.

	“If I don’t get a phone installed, she won’t agree to marry me. Director, please do me a favor.” Some desperate young people besieged the director of the telecommunications bureau, almost kneeling down to beg. The idea that a telephone is part of the wedding dowry has also become fashionable. Some people worry that this will fuel the already rampant trend of extravagant comparison.

	A newly married university graduate, when talking about his urgent need to install a telephone, believes: After getting married and starting a family, with parents and relatives scattered around, it’s inconvenient to visit each other often. If there’s a phone at home, there’s no need to rush around for small matters, which will change our way of life. Someone also predicts that the emergence of the “home telephone craze” may alleviate urban traffic congestion.

	However, predictions are still future events. Statistics from three years ago show: Sweden’s telephone penetration rate has reached 89.5%, the United States 86%, Britain 52%, and Japan 55.5%. While China’s mainland statistics for last year were only 0.72%. Although the country has opened up, it is still far from the world.

	In 1988, Hangzhou City, with its unprecedented development speed, made the per capita telephone penetration rate jump to the forefront of national capital cities, but it was still only 6%, which is not enough to make one happy.

	Lack of funds, lack of foreign exchange. Investment shortage is the fatal weakness of the telecommunications industry.

	After much trouble, I finally got through to the director of the telecommunications bureau’s direct line. The director said: In the past year, Hangzhou City set a record by installing more than ten thousand household telephones, 80% of which belong to private households, and another ten thousand households have paid and are waiting to be installed. This year, we will install more than ten thousand additional households, and the proportion of household self-funded telephones will continue to increase…

	This seems to be a rather dull set of numbers, but behind it, a new “capital flow” that is beginning to surge seems to be becoming clear: While economists worry about the overly narrow and skewed direction of personal consumption, hundreds of millions of yuan in household purchasing power have begun to withdraw from the daily consumer goods market and flow into the capital-short telecommunications industry.

	Redirection—a meaningful macro issue and direction!

### 消费热中的新走向——杭州家庭电话热一瞥

　　消费热中的新走向
    ——杭州家庭电话热一瞥
    本报记者  高海浩
    “嘿，你猜我在哪里打电话，就在家里！”元旦刚过，一位熟人通过电话向我送来新年的第一个问候。他是杭州某厂工人。
    “你有办法吗？帮我在家里装个电话，１０００元安装费早准备好了。”几乎就在同一天，另一位熟人向我提出新年的第一个请求。他是省级机关的普通干部。
    “杭城再度掀起电话热”——当地新闻媒介发出惊叹。也有人说，家里装电话，已同彩电、房子、液化气一样热门紧俏。
    又是一个“热点”！人们吃够了赶浪头的苦头，无论再添一个什么“热”，似乎都将不堪承受。而“家庭电话热”又会带来什么？
    在省级某机关大院，正当领导者围绕哪一级官员可享受公费安装家庭电话颇费心思时，他们属下的普通干部早已自己掏钱，悄悄地将几十条电话线牵入了家门。一位机关干部说：家中有无电话，曾经被当作官职待遇的标志，后来又成了“万元户”的象征物。现在电话能够进入寻常百姓家，体现了社会平等和进步。
    “不装电话，她就不肯结婚。局长，请您做做好事。”有些一筹莫展的青年人缠住电信局长，就差磕头作揖。结婚嫁妆要有电话机也开始成为一种时髦。有人由此担忧：这将助长已经盛行的奢侈攀比之风。
    一位刚结婚的大学生谈及他迫切需要安装电话的动机时认为：结婚成家后，与父母家人各处东西，平日走动很麻烦。如果家里有部电话，不必再为一些小事挤车奔走，这将改变我们的生活方式。也有人预言说，家庭“电话热”的出现，也许将缓解城市交通的拥挤状况。
    不过，预测毕竟只是未来的事情。３年前的统计表明：瑞典的电话普及率已达８９．５％，美国为８６％，英国５２％，日本５５．５％。而中国大陆去年的统计仅有０．７２％，尽管国门已经打开，但距世界依然遥远。
    １９８８年，杭州市以其罕见的发展速度，使百人电话普及率跃居全国省会城市前列，仍不过６％，并不足以令人欣喜。
    缺资金，缺外汇。投资短缺乃是电信业致命的要害。
    几经周折，我终于拨通了电信局长办公室的直线电话。局长说：在过去的一年中，杭州市创纪录地安装市内电话一万多户，８０％属私人家庭所有，另有一万多户已交费待装。今年还要再装一万户以上，家庭自费电话比重还将提高……
    这似乎是一串颇为枯燥的数字，但在它的背后，一股正在组合涌动的新“资金流”仿佛明朗起来：当经济学家担忧个人的消费投向过度狭窄、倾斜之时，成百上千万元的家庭购买力已开始退出日用消费品市场，转向资金短缺的电信业。
    分流——富有意义的宏观命题和走向！
