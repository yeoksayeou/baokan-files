After enterprises implemented the contract responsibility system and lease management, how should the supervising departments constrain the enterprises' short-term behavior? The approach taken by the Beijing Second Light Industry Bureau is to implement necessary "small macro" controls, using industry planning and directive planning interventions to guide enterprises to seek both immediate benefits and long-term development, ensuring stable investment in technical transformation projects. Over the past two years, the Beijing Second Light Industry System has completed or finished 1.505 billion yuan in technical transformation projects, significantly promoting technological progress in enterprises.

Since 1987, 90% of the enterprises in the Beijing Second Light Industry System have implemented contract and lease management, with contract periods not exceeding four years. Most of these enterprises produce low-technology, low-value-added products. Under these circumstances, some enterprises are concerned about the heavy repayment burden during the contract period and are hesitant to invest in technical transformation projects. Some enterprises want to focus on short-term gains and avoid developing new products with risks. Others are eager to undertake projects that yield quick profits. To address these issues, the Beijing Second Light Industry Bureau has taken two approaches.

First, they have formulated a long-term development plan for the industry and implemented directive planning interventions to supervise enterprises, helping them to leverage their strengths and mitigate their weaknesses. They support enterprises in developing new products and technical transformation projects that have a promising future and significant near-term benefits. Over the past two years, 51 projects have been implemented, with 50% of these projects aimed at enhancing technological capabilities through export earnings, 40% aimed at moderately expanding the production scale of short-supply products, and 10% focused on materials that will be in short supply in the future. Some of these projects have already generated profits of 86.56 million yuan after completion.

Second, they guide contract and lease enterprises to establish self-constraint mechanisms, encouraging them to increase enterprise accumulation with a "self-reliant" attitude. During the process of contracting and leasing enterprises, the Beijing Second Light Industry Bureau thoroughly examines the long-term planning content in the bidding process. They supervise enterprises to establish a target responsibility system that includes "development strategies." Currently, 72% of the contract and lease enterprises in the Beijing Second Light Industry System have accumulated funds for technical transformation and expanded production, and 69% of these enterprises have developed new products. Among these, 43 medium and small-sized enterprises have accumulated 41.75 million yuan. The Beijing Paper Box Factory, despite facing rising prices for raw materials, has a management team that looks to the future. They proactively signed a three-year "Technical Transformation Target Responsibility System" with relevant departments, investing an additional 500 million yuan in technical transformation projects.

　　强化行业规划　实施计划干预　稳定技改投资
    北京二轻总公司引导企业克服短期行为
    本报讯  在企业实行承包租赁责任制以后，企业主管部门如何约束企业的短期行为？北京市二轻总公司的做法是，实行必要的“小宏观”控制，通过行业规划和指导性计划干预，引导企业既寻求眼前利益又着眼长期发展，保证技改技措投资的稳定投入。两年来北京二轻系统完成或竣工技改技措投资１．５０５亿元，有力地推动了企业的技术进步。
    １９８７年以来，北京二轻系统有９０％的企业实行了承包和租赁制，合同期限都不超过４年，大多数企业生产的是低技术低附加值产品。在这种情况下，有的企业担心包租期间还贷负担重，对技改技措投入持观望犹豫态度；有的企业想打“零工”，不想开发有风险的新产品；还有的企业争上“急功近利”的项目。对此，北京二轻总公司从两个方面予以引导。
    首先，制订行业发展长期规划，实施中予以指导性计划干预，督促企业扬长抑短，支持企业上马远景看好、近期效益也显著的新产品开发和技改技措项目。两年来实施的５１个项目中，通过出口创汇增强技术素质的占５０％，适度扩大短线产品生产规模的占４０％，远期市场紧缺的轻工材料的占１０％，其中部分竣工后已创利８６５６万元。
    第二，引导承包租赁企业建立自我约束机制，以“自主”态度增加企业积累。北京二轻总公司在对企业的发包发租过程中，充分考察承包租赁投标中的远期规划内容；督促企业建立有“发展战略”等内容的目标责任制。现在，北京二轻承包租赁企业中，７２％的企业进行了技改技措性扩大再生产的积累，６９％的企业开发了新产品，其中４３户中小型企业即积累４１７５万元。北京纸箱厂在原辅材料涨价情况下，该厂承包班子眼光放远，主动与有关部门签订了３年“技术改造目标责任制”，再投入技改技措资金５００万元。
