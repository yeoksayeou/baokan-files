The president of the International Amateur Athletic Federation (IAAF), Primo Nebiolo, has been under intense criticism for two years due to a scandal, to the point where he had to resign from his position as the president of the Italian Athletics Federation. However, at the conclusion of the IAAF Council meeting today, he was unanimously re-elected for another term by the council members.

Nebiolo is 65 years old and a lawyer from Italy. It is alleged that during the 1987 World Athletics Championships in Rome, he abused his authority to alter the results of an Italian long jump athlete, allowing him to secure the third place.

Nebiolo stated that he remained in his position and was re-elected at the unanimous request of all the council members.

　　被丑闻困扰的国际田联主席连任
    新华社北京１月２９日电  据外电报道，国际业余田径联合会主席内比奥洛两年来一直因为一件丑闻而遭到激烈批评，以至于要辞去意大利田径协会主席的职务。但在今天结束的国际业余田径联合会理事会上，他又被委员们一致推选再次连任一届。
    内比奥洛今年６５岁，是意大利的一名律师。据说他在１９８７年罗马世界田径锦标赛上，曾利用职权作弊，篡改了一名意大利跳远选手的成绩，让他得了第３名。
    内比奥洛说，他是在理事会全体委员们一致的要求下才留下来连任的。
