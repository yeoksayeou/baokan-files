Cairo Tower
Liu Zhongdong

People are familiar with the Eiffel Tower in France or the CN Tower in Canada; these tall towers have added luster to the cities they stand in.

In the capital of the ancient civilization of Egypt, Cairo, there is a modern tower that can rival them—the Cairo Tower. It is located on Zamalek Island in the Nile River, overlooking the newly built high-rise buildings, bustling streets, and the domed mosques and ancient fortresses on both banks of the Nile day and night.

The Cairo Tower was completed on April 11, 1961, and stands at 187 meters tall, equivalent to a 60-story building. From the top of the tower, one can have a panoramic view of the entire city of Cairo. The highest level of the Cairo Tower is a bar, where visitors can rest after enjoying the scenery. The level below is a revolving restaurant, where diners can enjoy a meal while admiring the outside view.

The Cairo Tower adorns the city of Cairo, and sometimes it can be seen from tens of kilometers away, towering above the buildings. Its design is based on the lotus flower, a symbol of the pharaohs, and the entrance is decorated with a bronze eagle. The entire tower is adorned with 10 million colorful tiles, making it a magnificent sight with a unique national style.

　　开罗塔
    刘忠东
    人们都熟悉法国的埃菲尔铁塔或加拿大的多伦多广播塔，这些高塔都为城市的建设增辉添色。
    在文明古国埃及的首都开罗，也有一座与之相媲美的现代塔——开罗塔。它座落在尼罗河上的宰马利克岛，日夜俯瞰着尼罗河两岸新建起的高楼大厦、车水马龙的街市以及圆拱顶的穆斯林清真寺和古城堡。
    开罗塔建成于１９６１年４月１１日，高达１８７米，相当于６０层楼高。站在塔的顶部可以一览开罗市区全貌。开罗塔的最高层是一个酒吧间，游客在塔边观完风景后可在这里小憩。次一层是一旋转餐厅，想用餐的游客可以一边就餐一边观赏外面的景色。
    开罗塔点缀了开罗市，人们有时在十几公里以外就可以看到它高高地耸立在建筑楼群中。其塔身根据法老的象征而设计成荷花形图案，入口处装饰着一尊铜鹰。整个塔共用１０００万块彩砖装修，看上去蔚为壮观，具有独特的民族风格。
