Wang Ruoshui published a long article titled "The Problem of Realism and Reflection Theory" in the newspapers last year (published in *Wen Hui Bao* on July 12 and August 9, and in *Literary Theory Research* Issue 5). This article sparked discussions in the theoretical community.

Wang Ruoshui's Views

Reflection theory has long been regarded as a fundamental principle of materialism and the epistemological foundation of realistic literature. Wang Ruoshui questions this. He argues that the prevalent reflection theory comes from Lenin's *Materialism and Empiriocriticism*. This book emphasizes that objects or environments exist independently of humans, stressing the objectivity of reality and understanding reflection as mere copying or photography. According to this view, the subject depends on the object, while the object does not depend on the subject. This rigidly opposes the subject and object, which not only contradicts modern scientific conclusions but also deviates from Marx's views. In the first thesis of *Theses on Feuerbach*, Marx points out that the major flaw of all previous materialism is that it understands reality only from the object's perspective, not from the subject's perspective. In other words, it does not understand the real world as the result of generations of human labor. Engels said that materialism is merely the view that nature is the primary or first thing, with no other meaning. However, Lenin believes that every object of cognition is primary. Thus, for the desk in front of me, it can only be understood from the object's or perceptual form, not from the subject's perspective, and it cannot be understood as a product of practice. This reflection theory treats the subject as a passive container, describing cognition as a one-way activity from object to subject, thereby neglecting the role of humans. It also fails to explain the value attributes of things. For example, the value relationship of labor products is a certain social relationship between people, but it takes the illusory form of a relationship between objects. Marx's great contribution is to reveal the human relationships behind these object-object relationships. If we treat commodities solely as objects, we will never reach this understanding. Marx called his own materialism "practical materialism"; in his view, practice is not only the foundation of cognition but also the foundation of the existing world. The ontology of the universe is matter, and the ontology of history is practicing humans.

Wang Ruoshui supports Liu Zaifu's criticism of naive reflection theory but disagrees that the flaws in literature over the past few decades stem from naive reflection theory. He says that applying naive reflection theory to literary creation can only produce naturalistic works, but our past literature has often embellished and distorted reality, which is even worse than photographic reflection. The first principle of realism is truthfulness. Truthfulness does not exclude tendencies, but tendencies must not contradict truthfulness. Engels praised Balzac because he insisted on truthfulness at the expense of his political biases and beliefs. However, Mao Zedong placed the political criteria for literary criticism in the first position, neglecting truthfulness. Mao Zedong believed that as long as the politics are revolutionary, the political nature of literature will naturally align with truthfulness. Practice has proven otherwise. Under the "leftist" guidance, the stronger the political nature of literature, the further it deviates from truthfulness. Placing political criteria first leads to sacrificing truthfulness for political purposes. "Command literature" thus becomes alienated literature. The subjectivity of writers is lost in this way. Today's realism should maintain its critical and combative edge.

Yang Chunshi's Debate with Wang Ruoshui

On August 23, *Wen Hui Bao* published Yang Chunshi's rebuttal article. Yang argues that it is impossible to affirm both materialist ontology and practical ontology, which is the current philosophy's dual structure. Ontology is a philosophical concept that can only be singular. Reflection theory is not Marx's thought but Lenin's, stemming from materialist ontology. Marx's view is practical ontology, acknowledging that existence determines consciousness, but existence is not material facts but practical activities. Based on this philosophical foundation, historical materialism is established. Materialist ontology originates from the concept of substance. Old materialism and idealism have not escaped the influence of the concept of substance. The mainstream of modern philosophy denies the existence of substance, treating the world we face as a meaningful object of the subject's participation. Modern philosophy has established an ontology of existence. The ontology of existence holds that the sole starting point and basis for philosophical reflection is existence, i.e., living activities, which are the creation of meaning with the subject and object integrated, and consciousness and objects, subjects and objects are all analyzed from human existence. The objects in our experience have already been understood, and we cannot separate them from the subject. Affirming the existence of material substances inevitably leads to reflection theory, as this means that consciousness should not distort but only reflect material substances. Marx's practical philosophy can serve as the foundation for modern subjectivity philosophy, but it needs development, from practical ontology to the ontology of existence. Existence is subjective, while objectivity is a false concept, leading to the concept of substance. Reality always means reality for a certain subject, which has already been interpreted by the subject, so there is no such thing as an "original face." Literature is not a reflection of reality but an aesthetic interpretation of reality, transcending reality. The reality in the writer's pen is always marked with subjectivity, embodying the writer's aesthetic attitude, a "second nature." It is precisely because of this reflection theory that strips writers of their subjectivity and literature of its subjectivity, leading to the tragedy of literature.

Li Yadong's Debate with Yang Chunshi

On September 20, *Wen Hui Bao* published Li Yadong's article, debating with Yang Chunshi. The author states that Aristotle distinguished between the "first substance" and its variations. "Matter" is this "first substance," while "practicing humans" are changes within it. "Practice" is merely the self-activity of nature through humans. This should not be considered "dual." The so-called materialist ontology is about the natural level, while practical ontology is about the historical level. The former is a study of cosmology, and the latter is ontology. Just as social history is part of natural history, ontology is also contained within cosmology. Therefore, materialist ontology and practical ontology should not be opposed, seen as "dual." Regarding the theoretical basis of literary creation over the past few decades, the author agrees with Wang Ruoshui that it is not mechanical reflection theory. He says that so many formulaic, conceptual, and "theme-first" works, so many embellished and distorted reality works, cannot be explained by mechanical reflection theory. The guiding role of mechanical reflection theory in creation is minimal. The true cause of the "literary tragedy" is the long-standing tradition of didacticism and the modern forms of obedience and deification. In terms of literary interpretation, "reality" means facing the actual face of life, distinguishing it from the "fictional" and "hopeful." If, as Yang Chunshi says, there is no "original face," then there is no such thing as "distorting reality" or "embellishing reality." Pragmatism's sacrifice of truthfulness not only leads to the destruction of art but also to the degradation of creators. Truthfulness is the foundation of literary value and should also be the foundation of subjectivity theory. True subjectivity is never outside of truthfulness. Seeking to overcome the suffering of reality solely through "aesthetic" means is not the acquisition of the subject but the loss of the self; such aesthetic worship is not a variant of religion!

Wang Caiyong's Views

Following *Wen Hui Bao*, *Guangzhou Daily* published Wang Caiyong's discussion article on November 9. The author believes that materialist ontology is not dual but a relationship of inclusion. It is not possible to replace materialist ontology with the ontology of existence. Whether it is mechanical reflection theory, didacticism, or deification, it cannot explain the flaws in past literature. The flaws in past literature are not due to a lack of subjectivity but to a subjectivity that deviates from history. Embellishing and distorting reality is also a form of subjectivity. The greatest subjectivity of humans lies in their spirituality, and the greatest subjectivity of literature can only be in its spirituality. The subjectivity of literature is manifested only in the subjectivity of creation and reception, and the subjectivity of the object has no independent meaning. Regarding reflection theory, there is also the issue of how to understand it. If we do not understand reflection as a photographic copying but as a spiritual refraction, an indirect reflection mediated by the spirit, it is also acceptable. When facing a work, what we directly see is not some direct reality but the creator's thoughts, emotions, will, tendencies, etc., in short, the creator's spirit. The work is accepted by people only when the author's spirit is accepted. If there is any reality, it is only the reality understood or interpreted by the spirit, a spiritualized reality. Everything depends on the subject's spirit, and the spirit is the master of art.

### 关于现实主义和反映论的讨论

　　关于现实主义和反映论的讨论
    李伦
    王若水去年在报刊上发表长文《现实主义和反映论问题》（载《文汇报》）７月１２日、８月９日，《文艺理论研究》第５期），在理论界引起了讨论。
    　　　　王若水的观点
    反映论一直被说成是唯物主义的基本原理，也是现实主义文学的认识论基础。王若水对此提出质疑。他说，流行的反映论观点来自列宁的《唯物主义与经验批判主义》。这本书只是强调物或环境不依赖于人而存在，强调现实的客体性，把反映了解为摹写、摄影。按照这种观点，主体依赖客体，而客体不依赖主体。这是把主体和客体看成僵固的对立。这种观点不但不符合现代自然科学的结论，也和马克思的观点相左。马克思在《关于费尔巴哈的提纲》第一条中指出，从前一切唯物主义的主要缺点是：对现实只是从客体方面去理解，而不是从主体方面去理解。也就是说，不是把现实世界理解为人类世世代代劳动的结果。恩格斯说唯物主义不过是把自然作为本原或第一性的东西，此外没有别的意思。列宁却认为每一认识对象都是第一性的，这样一来，对于我面前这张桌子，就只能从客体的或直观的形式去认识，而不能从主体方面去认识，不能了解为实践的产物了。这种反映论把主体了解为受纳的容器，把认识描述为客体——主体的单向活动，因此忽视了人。它也不能说明事物的价值属性。例如劳动产品的价值关系是人与人之间一定的社会关系，但它采取了物与物的关系的虚幻形式。马克思的一大功绩就是在这种物与物的关系背后揭示了人与人的关系。如果把商品只当作客体，那就永远不会达到这种认识。马克思称他自己的唯物论是“实践的唯物论”；在他看来，实践不仅是认识的基础，而且是现存世界的基础。宇宙的本体是物质，历史的本体是实践的人。
    王若水支持刘再复对直观反映论的批评，但他不同意说近几十年文学的弊病是根源于直观反映论。他说，把直观反映论应用于文艺创作，只能写出自然主义的作品，而我们过去大量的文学作品是粉饰现实和歪曲现实，比照相式的反映还不如。现实主义的第一原则是真实性。真实性并不排斥倾向性，但倾向性一定不能违背真实性。恩格斯赞扬巴尔扎克，因为他坚持了真实性而牺牲了自己的政治成见和信仰。毛泽东却把文艺批评的政治标准放在第一位，真实性不提了。毛泽东认为，只要政治是革命的政治，文艺的政治性自然会和真实性完全一致。实践证明并非如此。在“左”的指导思想下，文艺的政治性越强，离真实性也越远。把政治标准放在第一位，在实际上导致为政治性而牺牲真实性。“遵命文学”变成了异化文学。作家的主体性，就是这样失去的。今天的现实主义应当保持批判和战斗的锋芒。
    　　　　杨春时与王若水商榷
    ８月２３日，《文汇报》发表杨春时的商榷文章。杨认为，不能既肯定物质本体论，又肯定实践本体论，这是现行哲学的二元结构。本体是哲学概念，它只能是一元的。反映论不是马克思的思想，而是列宁的思想，它来源于物质本体论。马克思讲的是实践本体论，他承认存在决定意识，但存在不是物质事实，而是实践活动，在这个哲学基础上建立了历史唯物论。物质本体论来源于实体观念。旧唯物主义和唯心主义都没有摆脱实体观念的影响。现代哲学的主流是否定实体的存在，把我们面对的世界当作主体参与的意义对象。现代哲学建立了关于存在的本体论。存在本体论认为哲学反思的唯一出发点和基础是存在，即生存活动，是主客体融为一体的意义创造，意识与对象、主体与客体都是从人的存在中分析出来的。我们经验中的对象都已经处于领悟之中了，我们无法把它与主体分离。肯定物质实体的存在，必然导致反映论，因为这意味着意识不应该歪曲而只能反映物质实体。马克思的实践哲学可以作为现代主体性哲学的基础，但它需要发展，由实践本体论发展为存在本体论。存在就是主体性的，而客体性是一个虚假的概念，它通向实体观念。现实总是意味着对某种主体而言的现实，它已经被主体所解释了，因此无所谓“本来面目”。文学更不是现实的反映，而是对现实的审美解释，它超越现实。作家笔下的现实都是打上主体性印记，体现作家审美态度的“第二自然”。正是由于这种反映论剥夺了作家的主体意识和文学的主体性，才造成了文学的悲剧。
    　　　　李亚东与杨春时商榷
    ９月２０日，《文汇报》又发表李亚东的文章，与杨春时商榷。作者说，亚里士多德曾区分“第一本体”和它的变形。“物质”就是这个“第一本体”，而“实践的人”则是它自身中发生的变化。“实践”也无非是自然界本身通过人而进行的自我活动。这不应该被认为是“二元”。所谓物质本体论是就自然的层次而言，实践本体论是从历史的层次上讲的。前者是宇宙论的研究，后者就是所谓存在论的研究。正像社会历史是自然史的一部分，存在论也涵孕于宇宙论。因此，不能把物质本体和实践本体对立起来，看成了“二元”。至于几十年来文学创作的理论基础问题，作者同意王若水说的不是机械反映论。他说，那么多公式化、概念化和“主题先行”的作品，那么多粉饰、歪曲现实的作品，用机械反映论显然解释不通。所谓机械反映论对创作的指导作用微乎其微。真正造成“文学的悲剧”的原因是具有悠久传统的载道论和以现代形式出现的遵命论、造神论。从文学解释的意义来说，“现实”意味着正视生活的实际面貌，意味着与“虚构的”“希望的”区别开来。如果按照杨春时说“无所谓本来面目”，那么也就无所谓“歪曲现实”“粉饰现实”了。实用主义的牺牲真实性不但导致艺术的毁灭，而且导致创作者的沦丧。真实是文学价值的根基，也应当是主体性理论的根基。真正的主体能动性绝不在真实性以外。对于现实的苦难单单求助于“审美的”克服，那不是主体的获得，而是自我的失去；那样的审美崇拜岂不是宗教变种！
    　　　　王才勇的观点
    继《文汇报》之后，《广州日报》在１１月９日发表了王才勇的讨论文章。作者认为：物质本体论不是二元对立的，而是主从包含的。不能用存在本体论取代物质本体论。无论是机械反映论还是载道说、造神说都不能说明过去文学的弊病。过去文学的弊端不在主体性太少，而在于体现了一种与历史相背离的主体性。粉饰现实、歪曲现实不也是一种主体性吗？人的最大主体性就在于他的精神性，文学的最大主体性也只能在它的精神性上。文学的主体性只在创造的主体性和接受的主体性上体现出来，对象的主体性并没有独立存在的意义。对于反映论还有个怎么理解的问题。如果我们不是把反映理解成照相复写式的直观反映，而是把它理解成精神的折射，以精神为中介的间接反映，那也未尝不可。面对一部作品，我们直接所见的不可能是什么直接的现实，而是创作者的思想、情感、意志、倾向等，总之，是创作者的精神。作品被人们接受，只是作者的精神被人们接受。要说有什么现实的话，那也只是作者精神所理解或解释的现实，是精神化的现实。一切取决于主体的精神，精神是文艺的主宰。　　　　　　　    　（李伦）
