	Beijing Encourages the Production and Operation of Small Commodities
	Issues Mandatory Production, Supply, and Sales Plans for Essential Living Goods

	Xinhua News Agency reports: Correspondent Zhao Xinglin reports: At the beginning of the new year, Beijing Municipal Commission of Commerce, Planning Commission, and Economic Commission have been actively studying and implementing measures for the production and operation of over a hundred small commodities.

	On January 6, relevant departments in Beijing determined the policy of "stabilizing the market, promoting production, regulating circulation, and ensuring supply." Specific measures include: for 26 essential daily industrial goods such as matches, soap, and toilet paper, the Municipal Planning Commission will issue mandatory production, supply, and sales plans for each item. In terms of production, raw materials, energy, and foreign exchange will be supplied in a coordinated manner, and the responsible banks will provide timely loans to ensure normal funding for production and procurement. In terms of procurement, products will be procured through contracts, and industrial and commercial companies responsible for production and sales will sign contracts for each item, clearly stipulating the responsibilities of both production and sales parties in the contract. If industrial enterprises fail to complete the plan and expand self-sales, or if primary wholesale companies fail to fulfill procurement contracts, in addition to holding enterprise leaders accountable, a fine of 10% of the loan amount for the unfulfilled or unprocured portion will also be imposed on the enterprise. At the same time, clear regulations have been made for the procurement and sales prices of products, reward methods, as well as financial subsidies for production and operation.

	To improve the operation of small commodities, the Beijing Municipal Commission of Commerce, in collaboration with the Municipal Finance, Taxation, and Labor Bureau, has selected 130 small commodities from the 430 small commodities operated by large and medium-sized stores, such as clothing hooks, batteries, zippers, pins, ballpoint pens, ink, knives, and iron pots, which are closely related to people's lives, and listed them as essential commodities. State-owned stores are required to operate these items well.

　　北京鼓励生产经营小商品
    对基本生活品逐个下达产供销必保计划
    本报讯  记者赵兴林报道：新年伊始，北京市商委、计委、经委等就抓紧研究落实上百种小商品生产经营措施。
    １月６日，北京市有关部门确定了“稳定市场抓生产，治理流通保供应”的方针。具体措施是：对火柴、肥皂、卫生纸等２６种基本生活日用工业品，由市计委逐个下达产、供、销必保计划。在生产上，对原材料、能源、外汇等实行配套供应，主管银行及时提供贷款，确保生产和收购的正常资金需要。在收购上，产品实行挂钩收购，承担产销任务的工贸公司，逐个按品种签订合同，并把产销双方应负责任明确在合同中。如果未完成计划而扩大自销的工业企业，或不履行收购合同的主营批发公司，除追究企业领导者的责任外，还要按欠交或欠收部分贷款的１０％，对企业处以罚款。同时，对产品的收购和销售价格、奖励办法，以及生产和经营中的财政补贴等，也都做出明确规定。
    为了搞好经营小商品，北京市商委会同市财政、税务、劳动局，已从大中型商店确定经营的４３０种小商品中，挑选出与群众生活关系密切的１３０种小商品，诸如衣服领勾、电池、拉锁、别针、圆珠笔、墨水、菜刀、铁锅等，列为必备商品，要求国营商店必须搞好经营。
