Title: The Great Wall and Chinese Culture

This is the title of a book of several hundred thousand words, but it is being used here in a smaller context.

In the midst of the cultural fervor, the Great Wall has once again become the center of people's discussions. Many articles discussing traditional Chinese culture mention the Great Wall. Some say the Great Wall is a masterpiece of ancient civilization and a symbol of the Chinese nation; some say it is a symbol of traditional Chinese culture; some say the construction of the Great Wall was to protect the advanced agricultural regions of the Central Plains from the harassment of northern nomadic tribes, and the Great Wall is a product of the distinction between the Chinese and the barbarians, a product of cultural differences; some say the Great Wall stretches across the vast deserts and towering mountains, and the cost and sacrifices of building it are immeasurable. In terms of its effectiveness, it has "only served to kill many workers, and the barbarians have never been stopped." People, from different angles, define what the Great Wall symbolizes and make different comments. It can be said that everyone has their own reasons.

Therefore, some people think that the Great Wall represents self-enclosure, conservatism, and backwardness, which is not an unreasonable argument. Half a century ago, Mr. Lu Xun had a similar view. He said: "I always feel that there is a Great Wall surrounding me. The materials of this Great Wall are old bricks and new bricks added later. The two kinds of things combine to form the wall, surrounding people." Obviously, this "Great Wall" is no longer a physical Great Wall, but an intangible Great Wall, one of the things that the Great Wall symbolizes—old culture. In the 1920s, the running dogs of imperialism and the remnants of feudalism, the Beiyang warlords, ruled China. They used old culture to oppose new culture to maintain their rule, and did everything they could to add bricks and repair the old culture full of holes, making Lu Xun feel surrounded, oppressed, and suffocated, and thus eagerly hoping "not to add new bricks to the Great Wall." Therefore, Lu Xun thought the Great Wall was a "great and cursed Great Wall!" (quoted from *Hua Gai Ji: The Great Wall*)

While people argue from different perspectives, I came to the Great Wall. Standing in front of the "Mutian Pass" stele, I couldn't help but feel a sense of nostalgia. But facing the newly repaired Great Wall, with green bricks and white lines, looking brand new, with more than a thousand steps, clear and distinct, and modern cable cars set up on the side, I couldn't help but laugh: this is not the Great Wall in the desert that has withstood the test of time!

The Great Wall, still the Great Wall today, is the result of continuous repairs and reconstructions over two to three thousand years. The Great Wall was built starting from the Eastern Zhou Dynasty, and after it was connected into the Great Wall during the Qin Dynasty, not only the Han people built it, but also the so-called "Northern Barbarians" and "Hu people" outside the pass built it. The Western Han, Eastern Han, Northern Wei, Northern Qi, Northern Zhou, Sui, Liao, Jin, and Ming dynasties all continuously built it. If it were not for the later repairs and reconstructions, the Great Wall would have long disappeared. In Inner Mongolia, Shaanxi, and Gansu, some sections of the Great Wall have been destroyed by nature and human damage, reduced to flat ground, which is a clear example. The Great Wall exists in the process of "modernization," and the Great Wall is no longer the original Great Wall.

The Great Wall, this great frozen music, has always been in motion. The changes and developments of Chinese traditional culture that the Great Wall symbolizes should be even more dramatic. It also has parts that are "naturally destroyed" and "humanly damaged," and it needs to be continuously repaired and rebuilt. Can we use the original "earthwork" and primitive methods from the time of its initial construction? It is unnecessary and impossible. We can only rely on modern civilization. Chinese traditional culture, first of all, must be able to exist to function. To continue to exist, it must be enriched and filled with modern civilization; otherwise, even existence becomes a problem, let alone functioning, being inherited, and promoted? The development process of Chinese traditional culture is a process of self-criticism and sublation. Respecting Chinese cultural traditions and inheriting excellent Chinese cultural heritage is for survival, for development, that is, for reality, for the future. On this issue, we cannot adopt an attitude of blind worship; more is needed is a critical perspective.

### 长城与中国文化

　　长城与中国文化
    这是几十万字专著的题目，放在这里是大题小做。
    文化热中，长城又一次成为人们议论的中心，很多论述中国传统文化的文章都提到长城。有说长城是古代文明的杰作，是中华民族的象征的；有说长城是中国传统文化象征的；有说修建长城，是为了保卫中原先进农业地区免受北方游牧民族的骚扰，长城是夷夏之别的产物，是文化差异的产物；有说长城横亘于万里荒漠、崇山峻岭之巅，修建它付出的代价与牺牲无法估量，就其效益而言，“从来不过徒然役死许多工人而已，胡人何尝挡得住”。人们从不同的角度设定长城所象征的事物，作出不同的评论，可谓仁者见仁，智者见智，各有各的道理。
    因此，有人认为长城是自我封闭，是保守落后的事物，并非创说。半世纪前，鲁迅先生就有类似的观点。先生说：“我总觉得周围有长城的围绕。这长城的构成材料，是旧有的古砖和补添的新砖。两种东西联为一气造成了城壁，将人们包围。”显然，这“长城”已经不是有形的长城，而是无形的长城，长城所象征的事物之一——旧文化。十九世纪二十年代，帝国主义的走狗、封建主义的余孽北洋军阀统治中国。他们借助于旧文化，反对新文化，以维系其统治，千方百计地增砖添瓦修补千疮百孔的旧文化，使鲁迅感到被包围、被压抑、被窒息，因而热切盼望“不给长城添新砖”。因而，鲁迅认为长城是“伟大而可诅咒的长城！”（引文见《华盖集·长城》）
    人们各执一端，争论不休之际，我来到了长城。站在“慕田古关”碑前，难免发思古之幽情。但面对修缮甫毕的长城，青砖白线，焕然一新，千余石阶，棱角分明，一旁又架设现代化缆车，不禁哑然失笑：这哪里是荒漠中历经沧桑的长城？！
    长城，今天依旧成为长城，是二三千年来不断修缮、改建的结果。长城，从东周开始建造，秦始皇时联接成为长城之后，不仅汉族修建，所谓“北狄”、“胡人”的塞外游牧民族也修建，西汉、东汉、北魏、北齐、北周、隋、辽、金、明等朝代都不断地修筑。如果没有后来的修缮、重建，长城早已不复存在。内蒙古、陕西、甘肃境内长城有几段因自然残毁，加之人为破坏，多被夷为平地，就是明证。长城在不断地“现代化”中才得以存在，长城早已不是原先的长城了。
    长城，这伟大的凝固的音乐一直处于流动之中，长城所象征的中国传统文化的变化、发展应该更为剧烈。她也有“自然残毁”与“人为破坏”的部分，也需要不断地修缮、改建。难道我们能采用初建时的“土石方”与原始方式吗？不必要，也不可能。我们只能借助于现代文明。中国传统文化，首先要能够存在下去，才能发挥作用。要继续存在，必须用现代文明来丰富自己、充实自己，不然存在都成为问题，哪里还谈得上发挥作用？谈得上被继承、发扬？中国传统文化的发展过程，就是一个自我批判与扬弃的过程。尊重中国文化传统，继承优秀的中国文化遗产，是为了生存，为了发展，也就是为了现实，为了未来。在这个问题上，不能采取一味顶礼膜拜的态度，更多需要的是批判的眼光。
