The State Bureau of Technical Supervision and the State Bureau of Prices have issued relevant regulations. In the purchasing and selling of cotton, the principles of quality-based pricing will be strictly adhered to. Acts of raising or lowering grades, raising or lowering prices, and tampering with weights will be subject to economic sanctions.

Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, January 4th – (Reporter Jiang Zàizhōng) In the purchasing and selling of cotton, acts of raising or lowering grades, raising or lowering prices, and tampering with weights will be subject to regular supervision and inspection. Those who violate the relevant regulations will be penalized economically. The State Bureau of Technical Supervision and the State Bureau of Prices recently made this requirement to fiber inspection agencies and price inspection agencies at all levels nationwide. This is to ensure the correct implementation of national cotton standards and the policy of quality-based pricing.

As a major cotton-producing country, cotton is a crucial agricultural product that affects the national economy and people's livelihood. In recent years, there has been a shortage of cotton, and last year the supply-demand contradiction remained prominent. One of the reasons for the significant fluctuations in cotton supply and demand is that some units have taken advantage of the lax state supervision over cotton quality. When cotton supply exceeds demand, they lower grades and prices for procurement, and reduce grades and prices for sales, which violates state policies and seriously harms the interests of cotton farmers, dampening their enthusiasm. When cotton supply is insufficient, some units raise prices for procurement, and sell at high prices, transferring losses to the vast majority of consumers. Such chaotic circulation order causes prices and quality to deviate seriously, severely disrupting the normal production and circulation of cotton.

The State Bureau of Technical Supervision and the State Bureau of Prices recently issued the "Implementation Measures for the Punishment of Price Violations in Cotton Purchasing and Selling." The "Measures" provide specific regulations for the supervision and punishment of quality and price in the procurement of cotton from farmers by cotton operating units, as well as the supervision and punishment of quality and price in the purchasing and selling of cotton between commercial and commercial units. For example, for those who raise grades, weights, and prices for procurement or hoarding, a fine of three times the amount of the price increase will be imposed, and in serious cases, with the approval of the higher-level price department, a fine of three to ten times the amount of the price increase will be imposed, and the relevant departments will be recommended to give administrative sanctions to the decision-makers. For those who lower grades, weights, and prices for procurement, they will be ordered to return the illegal gains to the cotton farmers. For general price violations, a fine of no more than 2,000 yuan will be imposed; for general and major price violation cases, a fine of no more than three times the amount of illegal gains will be imposed; in serious cases, with the approval of the higher-level price inspection agency, a fine of three to ten times the amount of illegal gains will be imposed; for price-violating units with illegal gains, the price inspection agency will also impose a fine of no more than three months' basic salary on the direct responsible personnel and the person in charge, deducted from their salary, and may recommend that the relevant departments give administrative sanctions.

　　国家技术监督局国家物价局颁布有关办法
    棉花购销坚持按质论价
    抬级压级抬价压价和抬秤压秤行为将受经济制裁
    新华社北京１月４日电  （记者姜在忠）棉花购销经营中的抬级、压级、抬价、压价和抬秤、压秤行为，将被受到经常的监督检查，违反有关规定者将被处以经济制裁。国家技术监督局、国家物价局近日对全国各级专业纤维检查机构和物价检查机构提出这一要求，是为了确保国家棉花标准和按质论价政策的正确执行。
    作为产棉大国，棉花是关系我国国计民生的大宗农产品。近两年，棉花短缺，去年棉花供需矛盾仍很突出。棉花供求大幅度波动原因之一，是一些单位钻国家对棉花质量监督不严的空子。棉花供过于求时，他们压级、压价收购，让级、让价销售，这种违背国家政策的行为，严重损害了棉农利益，挫伤了棉农的积极性；棉花供不应求时，一些单位又抬价抢购，高进高出销售，将亏损转嫁给广大消费者。如此混乱的流通秩序，造成价格与质量严重背离，严重地干扰了棉花的正常生产和流通。
    国家技术监督局、国家物价局最近颁布了《关于棉花购销经营中价格违法行为的处罚实施办法》。《办法》对棉花经营单位收购农民棉花的质量价格监督与处罚；对工商、商商单位之间购销棉花的质量价格监督与处罚都作了具体规定。如对抬级、抬秤、抬价收购或抢购者，将按其抬价金额处以３倍以下的罚款，情节特别严重的，经上一级物价部门批准，按其抬价金额处以３倍以上１０倍以下的罚款，并建议有关部门对决策人给予行政处分；对压级、压秤、压价收购者，责令其将非法所得退还给棉农。属一般价格违法行为的，处以２０００元以下的罚款；属一般价格违法案件、重大价格违法案件的，处以非法所得金额３倍以下的罚款；情节特别严重的，经上一级物价检查机构批准，处以非法所得金额３倍以上１０倍以下的罚款；对有非法所得的价格违法单位的直接责任人员和主管负责人员，物价检查机构也将根据情节，处以相当本人３个月基本工资以下的罚款，从其工资中扣缴，还可建议有关部门给予行政处分。
