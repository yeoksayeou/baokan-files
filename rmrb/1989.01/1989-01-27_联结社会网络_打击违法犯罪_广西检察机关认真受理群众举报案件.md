	Connecting Social Networks to Combat Illegal Crimes
	Guangxi Procuratorial Organs Seriously Handle Public Reports of Cases

	XINHUA NEWS AGENCY, NANNING — Reporter Zheng Shengfeng reports: The public reporting centers established in all 113 procuratorial organs across the region have formed a powerful network with society to combat illegal crimes. From July to the end of last year, these reporting centers received a total of 3,799 reports of various illegal and criminal cases. Among these, procuratorial organs have preliminarily investigated 609 cases, initiated investigations into 106 cases, arrested 56 individuals in 51 cases, and prosecuted 17 individuals in 15 cases.

	Recently, a spokesperson from the Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous Region People's Procuratorate released information on public reports to reporters. According to the spokesperson, the current situation of illegal and criminal activities, as reflected in social reports, has three main characteristics: First, there are many cases of embezzlement and bribery, accounting for 66.4% of the reported case leads; second, the amount of illegal and criminal activities is large, with 40 cases involving economic crimes where the amount exceeds 100,000 yuan; third, the level of illegal and criminal individuals is high, with 18 individuals at the bureau level or above, 159 at the county or department level, 261 at the section level, and 534 managers and directors of state-owned enterprises and institutions being reported.

	The case of Hu Xue, a 19-year-old criminal who easily embezzled a large amount of public funds, serves as a warning about the chaotic state of enterprise financial management. Hu Xue was originally the cashier of the Liufeng Plastic Molding Machine Factory in Liuzhou. In August last year, he embezzled 376,000 yuan of public funds and fled. The procuratorial organ, based on public reports, has arrested Hu and brought him to justice. Gao Guoping, deputy director of the Agricultural, Forestry, and Fisheries Bureau of Guilin Region, abused his power to collude with supply and marketing personnel to resell agricultural thin films, embezzling tens of thousands of yuan in price differences. Gao's actions again warn society: the exchange of power for money causes great harm to the state.

	Fearing the law and social supervision, 11 illegal and criminal individuals in Guangxi have recently surrendered to the authorities. Zhou Gongchao, the chief engineer of Dong Mine of Heshanshan Mining Bureau, took advantage of his control over the mine's coal resources to secretly provide geological maps and point out coal sources to individual coal dealers and small coal mine owners over the past two years, accepting bribes totaling 960,000 yuan. At the beginning of this year, Zhou discovered that his illegal activities had been reported by the public and surrendered to the procuratorial organ, turning over the bribe money in two installments totaling 825,000 yuan.

　　联结社会网络　打击违法犯罪    
    广西检察机关认真受理群众举报案件
    本报南宁电  记者郑盛丰报道：遍布在全区１１３个检察机关的群众举报中心，与社会联结成打击违法犯罪的强大网络。自去年７月到年底半年间，广西这些举报中心共受理群众举报各种违法犯罪案件达３７９９件。其中检察机关已初步调查６０９件，立案侦查１０６件，已逮捕５１件５６人，起诉１５件１７人。
    广西壮族自治区人民检察院新闻发言人最近对记者发布群众举报情况时指出，从社会举报情况看，当前违法犯罪活动主要有３个特点：一是贪污受贿案件多，已经受理的群众举报案件线索中，贪污受贿的占６６．４％；二是违法犯罪金额大，已立案侦查的经济犯罪案件中，犯罪金额在万元以上的共４０件；三是违法犯罪人员层次趋高，在被举报的人员中，有地局以上干部１８人，县处级干部１５９人，科级干部２６１人，国营企事业单位经理厂长５３４人。
    年仅１９岁的犯罪分子胡学轻易贪污巨额公款的行为，给企业财务管理的混乱状况敲响警钟。胡学原是柳州市力风塑料成型机厂出纳员，去年８月，他贪污公款３７．６万元潜逃，检察机关根据群众举报已将胡犯逮捕归案。桂林地区农牧渔业局副局长高国平，利用职权与社会上供销人员合伙倒卖农用薄膜，从中贪污数万元差价款。高犯这类行径又警醒社会：权与钱交换使国家饱受坑害。
    慑于法威和社会监督，广西近期已有１１名违法犯罪人员投案自首。合山矿务局东矿总工程师周贡超，利用自己掌握本矿区煤源资料的有利条件，近两年私自向个体煤贩和小煤窑主提供地质图纸和指点煤源，从中接受贿赂９．６万元。今年初，周发现自己的违法行为已被群众举报，遂到检察机关自首，分两次交出受贿款８．２５万元。
