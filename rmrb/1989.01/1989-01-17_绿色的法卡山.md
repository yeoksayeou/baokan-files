The New Year has begun, and the footsteps of spring are quietly approaching the southern border of our motherland. The Faka Mountain, which has been plowed by tens of thousands of artillery shells, is now covered with forests and filled with the fragrance of flowers and fruits. The tall, straight fir trees reach up to the sky; the proud pines stand tall and proud; the water jasmine releases a delicate fragrance, while the winter jasmine, camellia, and osmanthus flowers bloom in competition. From a distance, it looks like a patch of colorful clouds covering the mountain top. Who has made Faka Mountain so beautiful?

The garrison soldiers told me: Ten years ago, the soldiers planted more than 6,000 trees on the mountain during their training intervals. However, in January 1980, Faka Mountain was occupied by the Vietnamese army, and many of the already grown trees were cut down to build fortifications. Many newly planted saplings were also destroyed. In May 1981, our border defense troops successfully recaptured Faka Mountain. The Vietnamese army then concentrated their firepower, pouring more than 20,000 shells onto this mountain head of less than one square kilometer, leaving the entire mountain head riddled with bullet holes and in ruins.

Would Faka Mountain just remain pitted and uneven? No! With the heroic soldiers here, Faka Mountain will be here; with Faka Mountain here, there will be greenery! The troops drew up a blueprint for greening the battlefield, and the soldiers were determined to make the bullet holes disappear on Faka Mountain.

In the intervals between battles, the soldiers turned the shell holes into tree pits, planting fir trees, longan trees, almond trees, and banana seedlings. They also cleared land to plant bitter gourds, silk squash, cabbage, and planted wild chrysanthemums, roses, and month-after-month red flowers. Faka Mountain is even more beautiful today.

Just as Faka Mountain was filled with the fragrance of flowers and fruits, the Vietnamese army came to set fire to the mountain. A wicked fire burned down all the trees and grasses. Facing the blackened hill, the resolute soldiers did not lose heart. They loudly declared: "The Vietnamese army burns the mountain, and we will plant the forest, and we will definitely make Faka Mountain green." They searched everywhere for tree saplings and transplanted flowers. Soldiers on leave specially brought a few tree saplings from their hometowns; they wrote letters, asking relatives and friends to send seeds. People from all over the country also cared about the greening of Faka Mountain. Many forest farms and parks sent various tree saplings and flowers. Everyone wielded pickaxes, dug holes, and planted trees. They also shoveled grass from the mountain foot and covered the battlefield with green again.

Over the past ten years, the soldiers have planted nearly 60,000 trees, 20,000 flowers, and also planted 1.5 acres of pineapples, and built 3 banana groves. Now, many trees have grown tall, and the bananas hang in clusters on the branches. The battlefield is like a beautiful brocade.

The green forests are also a green shield for the soldiers. On one day in October 1986, a group of Vietnamese soldiers sneaked into our territory and hid in the dense green foliage. The soldiers quickly captured the enemy.

"I love the green military uniform, and I love the green military camp even more. I love the green life, and I love the green Faka Mountain even more."

This is the soldier's poem, and it is also the soldier's sentiment.

Oh, the green Faka Mountain...

　　绿色的法卡山
    广西  于礼谦
    新年伊始，春天的脚步悄悄移到祖国的南疆前线。被数万发炮弹耕犁过的法卡山，树木成林，花果飘香。那笔直的杉树，高插云霄；挺拔的青松，傲然凌空；水仙花喷吐幽香，迎春花、山茶花、瑞香花争相绽放。远远望去，宛如一片彩云罩在山头。是谁，把法卡山打扮的这般美丽？
    守备部队的同志告诉我：十年前，指战员们利用训练间隙在山上栽下了６０００多棵树木。然而，１９８０年１月，法卡山被越军占领，许多已经长大的树被砍倒筑了工事，不少新栽下的幼树被毁。１９８１年５月，我边防部队一举收复法卡山后，越军曾集中炮火，向这个不到一平方公里的山头倾泻了２万多发炮弹，整个山头弹痕累累，满目疮痍。
    法卡山你就这样坑坑洼洼地下去了吗？不！有英雄的战士在，就有法卡山在；有法卡山在，就有绿色在！部队制订了绿化阵地的蓝图，战士们决心让弹痕消失在法卡山。
    在战斗间隙，战士们把弹坑变树坑，种上了杉树、龙眼树、扁桃树、芭蕉苗，还开荒种上了苦瓜、丝瓜、白菜，栽上了野菊花、玫瑰花、月月红。法卡山，今朝更好看了。
    正当法卡山花果飘香时，越军又来放火烧山。一场罪恶的大火，把树木、花草烧光。面对黑糊糊一片山丘，坚强的战士们没有灰心，他们响亮地提出：越军烧山我造林，定让法卡披绿装。他们四处寻找树苗、移植花草。战士探亲特意从家乡带来几株树苗；他们写信，让亲朋好友寄来种子。全国人民也关心着法卡山的绿化，不少地方的林场、公园，送来了各种树苗、花卉。大家挥舞镐头，挖坑种树，还从山下铲来草皮，将阵地重新铺上绿色。
    十年来，指战员们就是在这种艰难的环境中，前后栽树近６万棵，栽花２万多株，还种了１．５亩菠萝，建了３处芭蕉林地。现在，不少树木已长大成材，芭蕉一串串挂满了枝头。阵地上，像有一幅幅美丽的锦缎。
    绿色的山林也是掩护战士们的绿色屏障。１９８６年１０月的一天，一股越军偷入我境，伏在密密的绿丛中，指战员们，很快将敌生擒。
    “我爱绿色的军装，更爱绿色的军营，我爱绿色的生命，更爱绿色的法卡山。”
    这是战士的诗，更是战士的情。
    哦，绿色的法卡山……
