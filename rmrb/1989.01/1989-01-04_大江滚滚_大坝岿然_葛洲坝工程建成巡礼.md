The Mighty River Rolls On, the Great Dam Stands Firm
– A Tour of the Completion of the Gezhouba Project

After 18 years of hard work, with the 21st generator unit put into operation and handed over for use, China's largest contemporary water conservancy project, the Gezhouba Water Conservancy Hub, was completed.

The Gezhouba Project began construction during the tumultuous years and was completed in the spring of reform. Over these 18 years, the Chinese people created a series of new records on the world's third-longest river, the Yangtze.

On January 4, 1981, the mighty Yangtze River was blocked in the middle. The river diversion took only 36 hours, second only to the world's largest Itaipu Hydroelectric Project in Brazil in terms of difficulty.

On June 15, 1981, the dam was navigable. The ancient Three Gorges, once described as "as difficult to ascend as the sky," became a smooth passage due to the reservoir's water level rising by 20 meters. On September 1, 1988, the 20-story-high Yangtze No. 1 Ship Lock was successfully tested and put into operation, standing alongside the world's largest ship locks, No. 1 and No. 2, on the Yangtze River.

On December 10, 1988, the largest hydropower station in contemporary China, the Gezhouba Hydropower Plant with an installed capacity of 2.715 million kilowatts, was completed and put into operation. Its annual power generation is equivalent to more than three times the national annual power generation at the founding of the People's Republic.

The mighty river rolls on, the great dam stands firm. Over eight years, Gezhouba withstood the impact of 19 major floods, including one that occurred once in a century with a flow rate of 72,000 cubic meters per second, as fierce as a mountain collapsing. Yet, the dam remained unscathed.

A Pioneering Exploration

The Gezhouba Project is a pioneering exploration. As the authority in China's water conservancy sector, Wéi Tíngqíng, put it, it is the largest "stone" that the Chinese people have ever touched in their thousand-year history of water control.

At 2:30 AM on December 26, 1970, Chairman Mao Zedong approved the construction of the Gezhouba Water Conservancy Hub in a report titled "On the Gezhouba Water Conservancy Hub Project" presented by Premier Zhou Enlai. On December 30, an old division commander from the war years led a construction team to the riverbank. Suddenly, the Gezhouba site was filled with the roar of cannons and the sight of thousands of people descending into the river. The old division commander, holding a steel shovel, stood at the designated site of the dam and solemnly declared, "Chairman Mao has approved the construction of the Gezhouba Water Conservancy Hub right here under our feet. We must use our own hands to build the first dam on the mighty Yangtze River." This old division commander was Zhang Tǐxué, who had served as the governor of Hubei Province before the Cultural Revolution. He raised his arms and shoveled the first scoop of earth to start the excavation of the dam foundation.

After starting the construction, Zhang Tǐxué's first task was to invite the designers, who had been enduring criticism, to the construction site to block the mighty Yangtze River.

Like soldiers hearing the charge, designers from all directions rushed to Gezhouba.

Cáo Lè'ān, a vice chief engineer of the Yangtze River Basin Planning Office who had studied in the UK before liberation and had been a university professor, was suddenly notified to go to the construction site to take on the design task while he was "standing aside" and participating in labor.

Zhang Ruìjǐn, a famous sediment expert in China, also arrived almost at the same time. When this elderly man, carrying his luggage, struggled to the construction site's reed hut office and introduced himself as "sent by Zhang Sheng," the room fell silent because a few days earlier he had been undergoing "reform" in Changyang countryside.

The cold wind blows over the great river, and the journey is difficult for the heroes. The elites who built Gezhouba gathered under the dam in such a turbulent historical period. Such simultaneous surveying, designing, and construction were bound to incur heavy costs. Not long after the start of the dam construction, due to some major technical problems, the entire project had to be suspended in 1972 for design modifications. Political turmoil plus technical chaos made it impossible for the dam construction to continue. No one knows what Zhang Tǐxué was thinking during the suspension, only that he was taken by cancer the following year. In his last moments, he still instructed others: "Do not forget to notify me when Gezhouba resumes construction."

"Failure to achieve victory in the campaign, the hero's tears fill his bosom." There are hundreds of such heroes buried on the high mountains by the Gezhouba shore.

As Difficult as Moving Mountains

Before the suspension, Gezhouba was already shrouded in doubts: what if the more than 500 million tons of sediment passing through the dam every year silted up the navigation channel?

Could the soft foundation with more than 50 layers of muddy interlayers ensure the stability of the dam with more than 10 million cubic meters of concrete?

The 20-story-high generator units are the largest in the world. Could China manufacture them with confidence?

Constructing the world's largest ship lock, with the two lower gates as large as two basketball courts combined, leaving no room for even a hair to pass through, who could guarantee absolute safety?

The Gezhouba Project has dozens of national firsts, and each first contains first-class difficulties.

In 1972, Premier Zhou Enlai, who was seriously ill, personally met with Lin Yīshān, then the director of the Yangtze River Planning Office, and many experts to discuss major strategies. He immediately decided to gather experts from all over the country to form the "Gezhouba Engineering Technical Committee" as the highest technical decision-making body for the dam construction. Premier Zhou said: "If the Yangtze River causes trouble, it will be 'recorded in party history,'" and "I am extremely cautious about this issue, as if walking on thin ice." After the establishment of the Technical Committee, the first decision made was to suspend construction and modify the design. In 1974, it was not until all major technical difficulties had been verified and confirmed to be resolvable that the decision to resume construction was made.

Doubt, as an old man of history, shouted for democratic decision-making and scientific decision-making, and finally heard the echo at the exit of the Three Gorges—Gezhouba. People saw that since the resumption of construction, the dam builders gradually turned to the new path of "science in command," and the ten years of reform accelerated this command.

More than 120 units of experts and technical personnel from all over the country participated in the scientific and technological breakthroughs, and more than 1,300 factories, enterprise groups, and research institutes undertook the research and development tasks. Just the national expert conferences alone held more than 100 times, producing more than a thousand scientific research achievements and developing tens of thousands of pieces of equipment.

"Sediment disaster" is the number one enemy of dam construction. When Gezhouba was launched, the Sanmenxia Water Conservancy Hub on the Yellow River had not yet completed the blasting and reconstruction due to sediment silting, and the nightmare of the Yellow River's silting deeply troubled the Yangtze River. Although the Yangtze River Planning Office had conducted experimental verification, the annual passage of more than 500 million tons of sediment through the dam was no small matter. If something went wrong, the consequences would be unimaginable. For a time, countless experts, workers, farmers, and technical personnel upstream and downstream of the great river were busy seeking an ideal anti-silting solution.

Old Professor Zhang Ruìjǐn, who became the deputy squad leader of the sediment squad as soon as he arrived at the construction site, set up a reed mat and a shed to test the sediment. His wife said he "forgot about home after going to the construction site," spending three springs and autumns without leaving the sediment squad. He proposed the concept of "still water navigation, flowing water sediment flushing" for Gezhouba based on the practice of Pan Jìxùn, a water conservancy expert of the Ming Dynasty, in controlling the Yellow River.

Wuhan, Yíbīn, and Nánjīng successively carried out large-scale sediment experiments. Deputy Director Wǒu Guórén of the Nanjing Institute of Water Conservancy Science led more than 30 technical personnel to theoretically demonstrate the reliability of the "still water navigation, flowing water sediment flushing" scheme, which took a full eight years.

The world's water control difficulty of sediment flushing and anti-silting was thus solved by people.

The designers of Gezhouba turned all the scientific research achievements into more than 2 million sheets and more than 100 tons of original and blueprints.

Evaluating the Merits and Demerits of a Thousand Years

Now, practice has checked the dam and silently evaluated the value of the efforts of all those who directly and indirectly participated in the construction of Gezhouba with data:

More than 90% of the sediment in the navigation channel upstream and downstream of the dam was flushed away by the flowing water, and the navigation channel was unobstructed with the help of mechanical desilting. The total amount of siltation in the entire reservoir was also less than expected.

The dam withstood the test of eight years of floods, and the horizontal and vertical displacements of the main structures of the dam body were within the designed allowable range.

The ship lock operated smoothly, with the actual time for ships to pass through the lock being 30-45 minutes, shorter than the designed 40-57 minutes.

The power plant generated electricity while under construction, accumulating nearly 60 billion kilowatt-hours of electricity in seven years, with a value of more than 3 billion yuan, and the income was equivalent to half of the total investment in the Gezhouba Project.

History will make a fair evaluation of the merits and demerits of the construction of Gezhouba. The existing checks are only the first chapter of the evaluation of a thousand years.

　　大江滚滚　大坝岿然
    ——葛洲坝工程建成巡礼
    新华社记者 徐士杰  陶国栋
    苦斗了１８个春秋，随着第２１台机组投入运行、交付使用，中国当代最大的水利工程——葛洲坝水利枢纽工程宣告建成。
    葛洲坝工程破土于动乱之秋，完工于改革之春。１８年里，中华儿女在世界第三大河长江上开创了一系列新纪录：
    １９８１年１月４日，万里长江被拦腰横锁。大江截流仅用了３６小时，其难度仅次于世界上最大的巴西伊泰普水利工程的截流；
    １９８１年６月１５日，大坝通航，自古以来“难于上青天”的三峡险滩由于库区水面升高２０米变成坦途；１９８８年９月１日，２０层楼高的大江１号船闸试航成功，并列于世界最大船闸之林的１、２号船闸至此并肩挺立在长江上；
    １９８８年１２月１０日，当代中国最大的水电站——装机容量２７１．５万千瓦的葛洲坝水力发电厂建成投产，它的年发电量相当于建国初期全国年发电量的３倍以上；
    大江滚滚，大坝岿然。８年间，葛洲坝经受了１９次巨大洪峰的冲击，其中百年一遇的一次每秒流量达７．２万立方米，其势如排山倒海，而大坝安然无恙。
　　前无古人的探索
    葛洲坝工程是一项前无古人的探索。用我国水利界权威魏廷琤的话说，它是中国人千百年来治水史上摸的一块最大的“石头”。
    １９７０年１２月２６日凌晨２时３０分，毛泽东主席在周恩来总理送给他的《关于长江葛洲坝水利枢纽工程》的报告上作了“赞成兴建此坝”的批示。１２月３０日，一位战争年代的老旅长带着一支施工队伍浩浩荡荡开到了江边。顿时，葛洲坝上出现了一幕万炮齐鸣、万人下江的宏伟场面。老旅长手握钢锹站在图纸标定坝址的地方庄严宣布：“毛主席批准我们兴建葛洲坝水利枢纽工程就在我们的脚下，我们一定要用自己的双手托起万里长江第一坝。”这位老旅长名叫张体学，“文革”前任湖北省省长。他挥动双臂铲起开挖坝基的第一锹土。
    开工后张体学办的第一件事就是把忍辱负重的设计师们从批判台上请到拦截大江的工地来。
    像战士听到了冲锋号，设计师们从四面八方涌向葛洲坝。
    解放前留学英国，做过大学教授的长江流域规划办公室副总工程师曹乐安，正“靠边站”参加劳动，突然接到通知，立即赶到工地挑起设计重任。
    我国著名的泥沙专家张瑞谨教授也差不多同时赶来了。当这位花甲老人挑着行李，步履艰难地来到工地的芦棚办公室门口，自我介绍“是张省长要我来”时，满屋愕然，因为几天前他还在长阳农村接受“改造”。
    风萧萧兮大江寒，壮士此去兮路艰难。建设葛洲坝的精英们即是在这样动乱的历史年代汇集到坝下。这样边勘测、边设计、边施工注定要付出沉重的代价。大坝开工不久，果然由于一些重大技术难题拦路，整个工程不得不于１９７２年停工修改设计。政治上的动乱加技术上的乱动，大坝没法不停工。人们现在已无法知道张体学在停工时想些什么，只知道他在第二年就被癌症夺去了生命。他在生命的最后时刻还叮嘱别人：葛洲坝复工莫忘了通知他。
    “出师未捷身先死，长使英雄泪满襟”。张体学这样的英雄，葛洲坝岸边高山上掩埋着数以百计。
　　难如山　英雄搬
    停工前的葛洲坝，早已是满天疑云：建坝后每年过坝的５亿多吨泥沙万一淤塞航道怎么办？
    含有５０多层泥化夹层的软弱地基，能不能保证１０００多万立方米混凝土浇筑的大坝稳如泰山？
    ２０层楼高的发电机组是世界同类机组中最大的，我国自己有把握制造吗？
    建造世界上最大型号的船闸，下首两个闸门有两个篮球场那么大，合起来不容穿过一丝头发，谁敢保证万无一失？
    葛洲坝工程有几十项全国第一，每一个第一都蕴含着第一等的难题。
    １９７２年，身患重病的周总理亲自找当时的长办主任林一山和许多专家会商大计，当即决定荟萃全国有关专家组成“葛洲坝工程技术委员会”作为建坝的最高技术决策机构。周总理说：长江出乱子是“要载入党史的”，“我对这个问题是战战兢兢，如临深渊，如履薄冰。”技术委员会成立后作的第一个决定就是停工修改设计，１９７４年，直到所有的重大技术疑难经过论证确认有把握解决之后才决定复工。
    疑难，作为历史老人向民主决策、科学决策发出的呼喊，最终在三峡出口处——葛洲坝听到了回声。人们看到，就从复工开始，大坝建设者逐步转向了“科学当家”的新路，十年改革更加快了这个当家的步伐。
    全国１２０多个单位的专家、科技人员参加了科技攻关，１３００多家工厂、企业集团和科研单位承担了研制任务，光是全国性的专家会议就开了１００多次，拿出了上千项科研成果，研制了数以万计的设备。
    “沙灾”是建坝的头号大敌。葛洲坝上马的时候，黄河三门峡水利枢纽工程因泥沙淤塞而开始的炸坝改建尚未完工，黄河淤塞的噩梦深深地困扰着长江。虽然，长办已作过试验论证，但每年５亿吨泥沙过坝非同小可，万一闪失，后果不堪设想。一时间，大江上下无数的专家、工人、农民和科技人员都为寻求一项理想的防淤方案而忙碌起来。
    到工地就当上泥沙班副班长的老教授张瑞谨，席棚安铺，工棚试沙，老伴说他“上了工地忘了家”，三度春秋不离泥沙班。他依据明代水利家潘季驯治黄的实践提出了葛洲坝“静水通航、动水冲沙”的构想。
    武汉、宜宾、南京先后都展开了规模庞大的泥沙试验。南京水利科学研究所副所长窦国仁带领３０多位科技人员从理论上论证了“静水通航、动水冲沙”方案的可靠性，整整历时８年。
    排沙防淤这个世界治水的难关就这样被人们破解了。
    葛洲坝的设计者们把所有的科研成果化为２００多万张、１００多吨重的原图和蓝图。
    　　　　评说千秋功罪的第一章
    如今实践对大坝的检验已为所有直接间接参加葛洲坝建设的人们的劳绩价值用数据作了无声的评说：
    大坝上下航道动水冲走了９０％以上的泥沙，加上机械排淤，航道畅通无阻。整个库区的淤积量也比预料的小；
    大坝经受８年洪水考验，坝体主要建筑物水平位移和垂直位移均在设计允许之内；
    船闸运行自如，船舶每次过闸时间设计为４０—５７分钟，实际为３０—４５分钟；
    电厂边建设边发电，７年累计发电近６００亿度，产值３０多亿元，收益相当于整个葛洲坝工程投资的一半。
    历史将会给葛洲坝建设的功过作出公允的评说。已有的检验只不过是千秋评说的第一章。
