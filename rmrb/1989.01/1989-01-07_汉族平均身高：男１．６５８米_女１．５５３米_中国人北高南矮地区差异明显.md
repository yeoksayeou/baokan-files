The latest research by anthropologists indicates that the average height of contemporary Han Chinese men is 1.658 meters, and the average height of Han Chinese women is 1.553 meters. The average height difference between men and women is 10.5 centimeters. The regional differences in height among contemporary Chinese people are quite pronounced, with people generally being taller in the north and shorter in the south.

Zhang Zhenbiao, a deputy researcher at the Institute of Vertebrate Paleontology and Paleoanthropology of the Chinese Academy of Sciences, conducted surveys and measurements in 16 provinces, municipalities, and autonomous regions of the Han population and 23 ethnic minorities. The results showed that, whether male or female, residents of the Yellow River basin and its northern regions are relatively tall. Residents of the middle and lower reaches of the Yangtze River, as well as those in Fujian and Guangdong, are slightly shorter than those in the Yellow River basin. Residents of the southwestern region are the shortest among contemporary Chinese people.

The research report published in the "Journal of Anthropology" states that the average height of Han Chinese men is 1.658 meters. In the northeastern provinces of Heilongjiang, Jilin, and Liaoning, as well as in the northwestern and northern regions of Shaanxi, Beijing, and Shandong, the average height of men is over 1.67 meters. In Jiangsu, Fujian, Hunan, Guangdong, and Yunnan, the average height of men ranges from 1.64 meters to 1.669 meters. In Guangxi, Guizhou, and Sichuan, the average height of men ranges from 1.6 meters to 1.639 meters.

The report points out that the average height of Han Chinese women is 1.553 meters, with 24% of women having heights over 1.59 meters. The geographical variation in women's heights is basically consistent with that of men.

Among the surveyed ethnic minorities, men from the northern and northwestern regions such as the Mongol, Hui, Uyghur, Tibetan, and Kazakh ethnic groups have an average height of over 1.67 meters. In the northeastern region, the Hezhen, Ewenki, Daur, and Korean ethnic groups have an average height ranging from 1.64 meters to 1.669 meters. The Li ethnic group in Hainan, the Zhuang and Miao ethnic groups in Guangxi, and the Bai and Dai ethnic groups in the southwestern region have relatively shorter heights, averaging between 1.6 meters and 1.639 meters. However, the Buyi, Hani, Jino, and Tujia ethnic groups in the southwestern region, as well as the Yao ethnic group in Hunan, have an average height of less than 1.599 meters. In terms of women, the Hui, Kazakh, Xibe, and Mongol ethnic groups have an average height ranging from 1.56 meters to 1.589 meters. The Tujia, Miao, Yao, Jino, and Blang ethnic groups have an average height of less than 1.49 meters. The average heights of men and women in 23 ethnic minorities are 1.635 meters and 1.529 meters, respectively.

　　汉族平均身高：男１．６５８米　女１．５５３米
    中国人北高南矮地区差异明显
    据新华社北京１月６日电  （记者李希光）人类学家最新的研究结果表明：当代中国汉族男性平均身高为１．６５８米，汉族女性平均身高为１．５５３米。男、女性身高平均差为１０．５厘米。当代中国人身高的地区差异极为明显，即由北往南，身高逐渐由高变矮。
    中国科学院古脊椎动物与古人类研究所副研究员张振标通过对１６个省、市、自治区的汉族和２３个少数民族的调查、测量发现，无论男性或女性，黄河流域及其北部地区居民的身高较高；长江中下游及福建、广东等地的居民，身高比黄河流域地区的略矮；西南地区居民的身高是当今中国人中最矮的。
    这项发表在《人类学学报》的研究报告说，中国汉族男性的平均身高为１．６５８米，东北的黑龙江、吉林和辽宁，西北和华北的陕西、北京和山东的男性平均身高在１．６７米以上；江苏、福建、湖南、广东、云南等地的男性平均身高为１．６４米至１．６６９米；广西、贵州和四川的男性平均身高为１．６米至１．６３９米。
    报告指出，汉族女性平均身高为１．５５３米，其中身高在１．５９米以上者占２４％。女性身高的地理变化趋势与男性基本一致。
    在被调查的少数民族中，北方和西北的蒙古族、回族、维吾尔族、藏族、哈萨克族男性平均身高在１．６７米以上；东北地区的赫哲族、鄂温克族、达斡尔族和朝鲜族的身高平均在１．６４米至１．６６９米之间；海南岛黎族、广西壮族、苗族、西南地区的白族、傣族，身高偏矮，平均在１．６米至１．６３９米间。但是，西南地区的布依族、哈尼族、基诺族和湖南的土家族和瑶族，身高平均都在１．５９９米以下。在女性方面，回族、哈萨克族、锡伯族和蒙古族，平均身高都在１．５６米至１．５８９米；土家族、苗族、瑶族、基诺族和布朗族等平均都在１．４９米以下。２３个少数民族男女平均身高分别为１．６３５米和１．５２９米。
