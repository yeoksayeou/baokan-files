Brazil's gold production hit a record high in 1988, with officially registered output reaching 56 tons. This surpasses the previous record set in 1983 by 2.3 tons and marks a 70% increase compared to the previous year. Including unregistered production, Brazil's actual annual gold output has reached 100 tons, making it the third-largest gold producer in the world.

The head of Brazil's National Mining Production Bureau, Marcos Marlon, stated that the increase in gold production this year is a result of a series of new measures implemented by the federal government. Starting from the beginning of the year, the government reduced the gold purchase tax rate, increased investment in the secondary market, and simplified the procedures for individual miners to sell their products. These measures have stimulated the enthusiasm of production enterprises and individual miners. Additionally, by strengthening the management of production and procurement, and improving the inspection system in mining areas, borders, and international airports, the government has significantly reduced the smuggling of gold.

Brazil's gold is primarily produced in the northern and northwestern Amazon regions, with estimated reserves of over 1,000 tons. There are more than 300,000 people who have been engaged in gold mining for many years, and during the dry season, even more people join the gold mining ranks. There are more than 2,000 gold mining points in the Amazon region alone. For a long time, due to poor management of the gold mining industry and excessive taxation, a large amount of Brazil's gold has been smuggled out of the country.

According to statistics, in 1986, about 70% of Brazil's gold production was illegally sold abroad. In 1987, the officially registered gold production was only over 30 tons.

　　巴西黄金产量创历史纪录
    去年官方登记产量达５６吨
    本报巴西利亚１９８８年１２月３１日电  记者兰才基报道：１９８８年巴西黄金产量破纪录，官方登记产量达５６吨，比历史上产量最高的１９８３年多２．３吨，与去年相比增长率达７０％，如加上未经官方登记产量，巴西黄金实际年产量已达１００吨，成为世界上第三大黄金生产国。
    巴西全国矿业生产局负责人马尔科斯·马龙说，今年黄金产量增长是由于联邦政府采取一系列新措施的结果，从年初开始，政府降低了黄金收购税率，增加了对第二市场的投资，并简化了淘金者出售产品的手续，从而刺激了生产企业和个体淘金者的积极性，同时，通过加强对生产和收购的管理，完善在矿区、边境和国际机场的稽查制度，大大减少了黄金走私外流现象。
    巴西黄金主要产自北部和西北部亚马孙地区，蕴藏量估计达１０００多吨，长年从事淘金业者不下３０万人，每到干旱季节还有大批人员加入淘金行列，仅在亚马孙地区就有２０００多个淘金点。长期以来，由于对淘金业管理不善和征税过高等因素，使巴西大量黄金走私外流。
    据统计，１９８６年巴西生产的黄金约有７０％左右被非法倒卖流入别国，１９８７年官方登记的黄金产量只有３０多吨。
