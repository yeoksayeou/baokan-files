This Spring Festival, Beijing's streets will see more signs prohibiting the setting off of fireworks and firecrackers, reminding citizens that doing so in busy commercial areas, important government buildings, hospitals, and other places will result in penalties.

The spokesperson for the Beijing Municipal Public Security Bureau stated today that this year, the 361 areas designated as no-burn zones last year will be reviewed, and the no-burn zones will continue to be expanded. Through setting up no-burn signs, having police stations sign no-burn agreements with residents, and other means, the public will be encouraged to voluntarily comply.

It is understood that after the Beijing Municipal Public Security Bureau strengthened the management of fireworks and firecrackers, the number of injuries, fires, and pollution caused by the setting off of fireworks and firecrackers during the 1988 New Year and Spring Festival was significantly lower than in previous years.

The spokesperson for the Beijing Municipal Public Security Bureau revealed that this year, the channels for purchasing fireworks and firecrackers will be strictly controlled, limiting the types and quantities of products allowed. Those that are easily harmful to people, likely to cause fires, or cause severe pollution will all be listed as prohibited items. In addition, cities, districts, and counties will each establish inspection teams to focus on investigating and shutting down illegal activities such as private purchasing, transporting, and manufacturing.

　　首都加强管理烟花爆竹
    繁华地区将设禁放标志
    本报北京１月１２日讯  今年春节，首都北京街头将出现更多的烟花爆竹禁放标志，用来提醒市民如果在繁华商业区、重要机关、医院等地燃放鞭炮会被处以处罚。
    北京市公安局新闻发言人今天表示，今年要对去年划定的３６１处禁放区进行复核，还将继续扩大禁放区域，并通过设立禁放标志、派出所与居民签定禁放协议等形式，发动广大群众自觉遵守。
    据了解，经过北京市公安机关加强烟花爆竹管理工作，１９８８年元旦、春节期间，由于燃放烟花爆竹所造成的伤人、火灾及污染明显小于往年。
    北京市公安局新闻发言人透露，今年将严格控制烟花爆竹进货渠道，限制进货品种和数量，对于那些易于伤人、引起火灾、污染严重的品种都将列为禁购、禁销、禁放的危险品种。此外，市、区、县将分别成立检查队，重点查堵取缔私购、私运、私造等非法活动。
