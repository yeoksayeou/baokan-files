Guatemalan President Refuses to Dialogue with Guerrillas
Guerrillas Claim They Will Directly Negotiate with Armed Forces

New China News Agency Beijing, January 29th: Guatemala City News: Guatemalan President Vinicio Cerezo today reiterated that his government will not hold talks with the guerrillas until they lay down their arms.

Cerezo made these remarks in response to the recent demand by the Guatemalan National Revolutionary Union for a dialogue with the president in Venezuela.

He pointed out that government dialogue with the guerrillas should be conducted within the legal framework, that is, they must lay down their arms and gain legitimacy. He said that the government advocates the establishment of certain institutions to allow these people to participate in political life.

According to EFE News Agency, the leader of the Guatemalan guerrilla organization, the National Revolutionary Union, Angel Sandoval, criticized Cerezo's refusal to hold talks with the guerrillas in Venezuela on February 2nd in Panama City. He pointed out that if President Cerezo does not engage in dialogue with them, the National Revolutionary Union will directly negotiate with the Guatemalan armed forces.

Sandoval also demanded that the Central American summit scheduled for February discuss the conflict in Guatemala.

The Guatemalan government and the guerrillas held talks in Madrid, the capital of Spain, in October 1987 to resolve the domestic armed conflict, but due to differences between the two sides, no agreement was reached.

　　危地马拉总统拒绝同游击队对话    
    游击队声称将同武装部队直接会谈
    新华社北京１月２９日电  危地马拉城消息：危地马拉总统比尼西奥·塞雷索今天重申，在游击队放下武器之前，他的政府不同他们举行会谈。
    塞雷索是针对危地马拉全国革命联盟不久前要求同总统在委内瑞拉举行对话而发表上述讲话的。
    他指出，政府同游击队的对话应在法律范围内进行，即他们必须放下武器，取得合法性。他说，政府主张建立一些机构，以便让这些人能参与政治生活。
    另据埃菲社报道，危地马拉游击队组织全国革命联盟领导人安赫尔·桑多瓦尔２８日在巴拿马城批评塞雷索拒绝２月２日在委内瑞拉同游击队举行会谈的做法。他指出，如果塞雷索总统不同他们对话，全国革命联盟将同危地马拉武装部队直接会谈。
    桑多瓦尔还要求２月举行的中美洲首脑会议讨论危地马拉的冲突问题。
    危地马拉政府与游击队曾于１９８７年１０月在西班牙首都马德里就解决国内武装冲突问题举行过对话，但由于双方有分歧，没有达成协议。
