According to the Agricultural Tax Collection and Management Bureau of the Ministry of Finance, by the end of last year, the total agricultural tax collected nationwide reached 5.187 billion yuan, exceeding the annual collection target by 12.91 percent and growing by 5.06 percent compared to the previous year.

Last year, the crop yields in disaster-stricken areas were better than expected. Most provinces, autonomous regions, and municipalities directly under the Central Government completed their state-assigned collection tasks ahead of schedule. In areas with bumper harvests, efforts were made to clear up overdue taxes from previous years, which also increased the tax revenue. Additionally, various regions strengthened the collection of agricultural special product taxes, with this portion of agricultural tax increasing by 13.91 percent compared to the previous year.
