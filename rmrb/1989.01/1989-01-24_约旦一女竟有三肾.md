A 17-year-old Jordanian girl has three kidneys, and she is in good health and living a normal life.

According to a report by the Jordanian newspaper *Al-Mithaq* on January 19, the girl, Joudat Muhammad, was admitted to a hospital in Amman for an X-ray examination. During the examination, it was discovered that she has three kidneys. On the right side of her abdomen, there are two kidneys that are independent but connected by a thin muscle membrane and arteries. The third kidney is located on the left side of her abdomen.

Dr. Kurkush, a specialist in kidney and urinary system diseases at the hospital, said that all three of her kidneys are functioning normally. This condition does not affect her health or her future married life. He also mentioned that this is the third case of a person having three kidneys that he has encountered since 1957.

　　约旦一女竟有三肾
    新华社安曼电  据约旦《宪章报》１月１９日报道，一位１７岁约旦姑娘生有３个肾，健康状况良好，生活正常。
    报道说，“一个星期以前，结婷·穆罕默德小姐进入安曼一家医院，进行放射线透视检查时，发现她的体内有３个肾。在她腹部的右侧分别长有两个独立的肾，但这两个肾之间由肌肉薄膜和动脉连接，第３个肾生在她的腹部左侧。”
    这家医院的肾脏和泌尿系统医生库尔库什博士说，她的３个肾的功能都完好，这种现象既不影响她的身体健康，也不影响她在结婚后的生活。他还说，这是他自１９５７年以来接触到的第３个生有３个肾的人。
