How to improve the multi-party cooperation system under the leadership of the Communist Party of China is a matter of great concern to the representatives attending the Fifth National Congress of the Jiusan Society. Yesterday afternoon, more than 20 representatives discussed this issue at a meeting and put forward some constructive opinions.

The representatives pointed out that the multi-party cooperation system should be reflected in the Constitution to clarify the status and role of the democratic parties, so that the democratic parties have legal qualifications. This is the first step in improving the multi-party cooperation system.

At present, the channels for democratic parties to participate in politics and policy-making are mainly through the People's Congress, the CPPCC, government agencies, and various symposiums convened by the Communist Party. In addition, there are some activities independently organized by the democratic parties. Some representatives believe that strengthening the People's Congress should be the core issue in improving the multi-party cooperation system. Currently, only the Communist Party has a delegation in the People's Congress. The goal of the multi-party cooperation system should be for each democratic party to have a delegation in the People's Congress. Some comrades believe that to improve the multi-party cooperation system, the functions of the CPPCC should be strengthened. Major state decisions and personnel arrangements can be discussed through the CPPCC and then submitted to the People's Congress for approval. This form can make the power structure more complete, standardized, and scientific. Beijing has already implemented a similar practice, with good results, and it should be considered for promotion and legalization. Some comrades suggest that the CPC Central Committee convene a formal multi-party joint conference, formulate regulations, and establish a joint deliberation body for political parties, making the multi-party cooperation system institutionalized.

Those who spoke at the meeting included representatives from the fields of philosophy, law, natural sciences, and engineering technology: Li Gangming, Fang Qiang, Li Xinzhou, Li Jing, Ying Kefu, Yu Jisheng, Shen Genrong, Liu Ronghan, Ni Zhengmao, Li Yuzhen, Zhang Jidong, Xie Lijuan, and Fan Zichang.

　　九三学社“五大”代表座谈多党合作
    建议设立各政党联合议事机构使多党合作制度化
    本报北京１月３日讯  如何完善中国共产党领导下的多党合作制，是出席九三学社第五次全国代表大会的代表们颇为关切的一个问题。昨日下午，２０余位代表在座谈会上，对此提出了一些建设性的意见。
    代表们指出，多党合作制，应在宪法中有所反映，以明确民主党派的地位、作用，使民主党派具有法定的资格，这是完善多党合作制首要的一环。
    目前，民主党派参政议政的渠道主要是：人民代表大会、政协、政府机构，参加中共召开的各种座谈会，此外还有民主党派独立开展的一些活动。一些代表认为，应把健全人民代表大会作为完善多党合作制的核心问题。现在，人民代表大会中只有共产党有代表团，多党合作制的目标，应该是各民主党派也有代表团在人大活动。也有的同志认为，完善多党合作制，应强化政协的职能，国家的重大决策、人事安排等，可通过政协协商后，交人大审批。这种形式可以使权力机构更完整、规范、更科学。现在北京市已有类似的做法，效果较好，应考虑加以推广并法律化。也有的同志认为，由中共中央召集一个正式的多党联席会议，制订章程，设立各政党联合议事的机构，使多党合作制度化。
    在座谈会上发言的有来自哲学、法学和自然科学、工程技术界的代表李冈鸣、方强、李新洲、李敬、应克复、虞积生、沈根荣、刘荣汉、倪正茂、李玉贞、张继东、谢丽娟、范子昌等。
