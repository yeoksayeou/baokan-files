The price department in Chenzhou region has encountered difficulties in collecting illegally obtained funds. The Chenzhou Metallurgical Industry Company, by exploiting its control over the distribution of various types of bonus and allocated steel materials, withheld 1,259 tons of steel materials that should have been allocated, and illegally sold these materials, earning over 780,000 yuan in illegal income.

In November 1988, the Chenzhou Price Inspection Bureau decided to confiscate 135,000 yuan of the company's illegal income and impose a fine of 5,000 yuan. On November 28, the Chenzhou Price Inspection Bureau sent the payment notice to the Chenzhou Metallurgical Industry Company, but the company refused to stamp the notice and became angry with the personnel who delivered it. On November 29, relevant leaders notified the Price Inspection Bureau to reduce the confiscation amount to 100,000 yuan. The Price Inspection Bureau quickly rewrote the payment notice and sent it over, but the Metallurgical Industry Company still refused to stamp it. On November 30, the Price Inspection Bureau received another notice reducing the confiscation amount to 90,000 yuan. They had no choice but to follow the leaders' instructions and rewrite the payment notice again. However, the Chenzhou Price Inspection Bureau not only failed to collect the illegal income but also kept receiving phone calls requesting reductions or exemptions from fines and confiscation amounts.
