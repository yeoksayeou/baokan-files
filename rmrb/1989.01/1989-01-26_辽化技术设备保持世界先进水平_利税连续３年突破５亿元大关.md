The Liaoning Petrochemical Company has been tracking advanced technologies and equipment both domestically and internationally, and has been carrying out timely updates and renovations, ensuring that the company maintains a world-advanced level. The company's profits and taxes have consecutively surpassed the 500 million yuan mark for three years.

Liaoning Petrochemical is a large-scale petrochemical fiber integrated enterprise built in the 1970s with significant investment. Its main technological equipment was imported from France, West Germany, Italy, and Japan, making it highly modernized. From the beginning, they realized that if some factories do not update and renovate their imported technologies and equipment in a timely manner, they will quickly become outdated. Liaoning Petrochemical started updating and renovating in 1983, soon after it began operations. They have now completed over 160 renovation projects.

Once, company manager Li Chunfang went to France for an inspection and discovered that the Arras plant's nylon 66 spinning technology was the most advanced high-speed spinning technology of the 1980s. He then introduced this technology and key equipment, establishing the country's first high-speed production line. This made China, following France and the United States, the third country in the world to adopt nylon 66 high-speed spinning technology.

Energy shortages have long been a persistent "old and difficult" problem. They allocated 30% of their total investment to energy-saving renovations. Now, the company's comprehensive energy utilization rate has leaped to the advanced level among domestic peers.

　　辽化技术设备保持世界先进水平    
    利税连续３年突破５亿元大关
    本报讯  辽阳石油化纤公司追踪国内外的先进技术设备，及早开展更新改造，使企业一直保持世界先进水平，该公司利税连续３年突破５亿元大关。
    辽化是我国７０年代投资兴建的大型石油化纤联合企业，主要技术设备从法国、西德、意大利和日本引进，现代化程度较高。他们一开始就注意到有些厂从国外引进的技术设备后，不及时开展更新改造，也会很快老化。辽化从１９８３年投产，便开始搞经常性的更新、改造。现已完成１６０多个改造项目。
    有一次，公司经理李春芳到法国考察，发现阿拉斯厂锦纶６６纺丝是８０年代最先进的高速纺技术，便引进这种技术专利和关键设备，建成国内第一条高速生产线，使我国继法国、美国之后，成为世界上第三个采用锦纶６６高速纺技术的国家。
    能源紧张是长期没解决的“老大难”问题。他们拿出总投资的３０％用于节能改造，现在全公司的综合能源利用率跃为全国同行业的先进水平。
