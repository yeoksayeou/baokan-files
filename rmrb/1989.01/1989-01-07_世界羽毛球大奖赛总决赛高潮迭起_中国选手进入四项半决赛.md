The World Badminton Grand Prix Finals reached a thrilling climax tonight as four Chinese players advanced to the semifinals. The players are Xiong Guobao, Zhao Jianhua, Li Lingwei, Han Aiping, Zhang Qingwu, Lin Ying/Gu Wei Zhen, and Wang Pengren/Shi Fangjing.

In tonight's matches, Xiong Guobao faced a tough challenge from Indonesia's Liu Banggao. The Indonesian player was determined to win and frequently executed powerful smashes, creating a tense atmosphere. Xiong fell behind 8-12 in the first set but remained composed and eventually won 15-12. He then secured the second set 15-11. Zhao Jianhua and Indonesia's Adi, both undefeated in their group, fought fiercely. Zhao took the first set 18-13 and then won the second set 15-8.

The women's singles matches were less intense. Li Lingwei defeated Denmark's Per Nielsen 2-0 on January 4th and then beat Hong Kong's Chan Man Wa 2-0 tonight. Han Aiping easily defeated Hong Kong's Lai Kwok Mei 2-0 yesterday, and her opponent tonight withdrew due to illness, allowing Han to advance.

Lin Ying/Gu Wei Zhen faced a strong challenge from South Korea's Kim Ryang Ja/Jeong So Young. Lin Ying's powerful smashes earned her rounds of applause from the audience. Despite their strength, the South Korean players lacked experience and lost 1-2. Newcomer Zhang Qingwu performed well, defeating Indonesian star Lu Tianning 2-0 on the first day and Hong Kong's Yang Yikui 2-0 tonight. However, he lost to Denmark's Froste. Froste, who had previously played against Zhang, praised his improvement. The men's singles matches were intense, with Lu Tianning, who lost to Zhang, defeating Froste 2-1, allowing Zhang to advance to the semifinals.

The defending men's doubles champions Li Yongbo/Tian Bingzhi defeated Swedish players Andersson/Johansson 2-0 on January 5th but lost 1-2 to Indonesia's Hong Zhongzhong/Guo Hongyuan tonight, missing out on a spot in the semifinals.

In the mixed doubles, Wang Pengren and Shi Fangjing defeated Swedish players yesterday 2-0 and then beat Denmark's Henning Swal/Do Kjaer 2-0 tonight, securing their place in the semifinals.

Other foreign players who advanced include men's singles players Sujiyanto from Indonesia and Froste from Denmark, women's singles players Hwang Hye-young and Lee Young-sook from South Korea, men's doubles players Sidek brothers from Malaysia, women's doubles players Jeong Myung-hee/Hwang Hye-young from South Korea, and mixed doubles players Ann Gard and Gillian Gilks from Britain.

　　世界羽毛球大奖赛总决赛高潮迭起
    中国选手进入四项半决赛
    本报香港１月６日电  记者连锦添报道：世界羽毛球大奖赛总决赛至今晚子夜时分筛选出４强，中国名将熊国宝、赵剑华、李玲蔚、韩爱平、张青武、林瑛／关渭贞、王朋仁／史芳静进入半决赛。
    在今晚的比赛中，熊国宝对印尼选手刘邦高不敢掉以轻心。对方志在必得，频频扣杀，气氛惊险，第一局熊曾以８∶１２落后，但未乱方寸，最后终于磨成１５∶１２。第二局则以１５∶１１获胜。赵剑华与印尼阿迪在小组里皆２战２胜，今晚争个你死我活，赵先以１８∶１３拿下第一局，继而又以１５∶８取胜。
    与男单分分必争的现场气氛比较，女子单打的分组赛打得不甚激烈。李玲蔚４日晚以２∶０胜丹麦的珀·内泽戈尔，今晚又以２∶０胜香港的陈敏华。韩爱平昨晚以２∶０轻取香港的赖国梅，今晚对手因病弃权，韩爱平顺利入围。
    林瑛／关渭贞今晚面对咄咄逼人的南朝鲜金练子／郑素英，表现沉着，林瑛的强力扣杀赢得观众阵阵掌声。实力不弱的南朝鲜队员因经验不如对方，以１∶２败北。中国队新秀张青武表现不俗，首日以２∶０赢印尼名将罗天宁，今晚又２∶０胜香港杨奕琦，唯败在丹麦球王弗罗斯特拍下。曾交过手的弗罗斯特称张青武发挥有进步。男单局面大有星星相克之势，败于张青武的罗天宁今晚又神奇地以２∶１击败弗罗斯特，张青武得以进入半决赛。
    上届男双冠军李永波／田秉毅５日以２∶０胜瑞典选手安德森／约翰森，今晚与印尼洪忠中／郭宏源对阵，却以１∶２败阵，失去半决赛资格。
    混合双打王朋仁和史芳静，昨日以２∶０胜了瑞典队员，今晚又以２∶０击败丹麦的亨·斯瓦勒／多·克耶尔，顺利进入半决赛。
    外国选手出线的包括，男单印尼苏吉亚托，丹麦弗罗斯特，女单南朝鲜黄惠英、李英淑，男双马来西亚西德克兄弟，女双南朝鲜的郑明熙／黄惠英，混合双打是英国的安·古德和吉·高尔斯。
