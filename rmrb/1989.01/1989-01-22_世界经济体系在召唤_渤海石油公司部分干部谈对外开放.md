	The World Economic System is Calling
	—Some Cadres of Bohai Oil Company Discuss Opening Up
	By Reporter Lù Háng

	Comparing to Identify Gaps

	The cadres of Bohai Oil Company have a deeper understanding of the commodity economy. This is because they have learned to make "horizontal" and "vertical" comparisons. One is to compare China's Bohai Oilfield with Europe's North Sea Oilfield; the other is to compare Bohai Oilfield before and after opening up.

	Company General Manager Cáo Dé'ān said: "In 1981, when I visited abroad, I learned that the North Sea Oilfield and Bohai Oilfield started at the same time. By the early 1980s, the North Sea Oilfield could already produce 100 million tons of crude oil. However, by the early 1980s, despite having equipped more than 100 million yuan worth of equipment, Bohai Oilfield's annual crude oil production was only about 100,000 tons. An important reason for this gap is that they have always faced the world, while we were 'closed off' for too long."

	According to statistics, the cost of drilling an onshore oil well generally does not exceed $1 million, while drilling an offshore oil well costs $8 million to $10 million. Offshore oil exploration is more technically complex, riskier, and has a longer cycle. Therefore, most countries in the world adopt international cooperation to conduct offshore oil exploration and development. In the North Sea Oilfield, there are more than 200 foreign oil companies participating in cooperation in the British waters alone, and more than 40 in the Norwegian waters. What about Bohai Oilfield? Before it opened up in 1980, it was isolated from international society and the international market. While foreign oil companies were using modern equipment to accelerate offshore oil development in an open system, the employees of Bohai Oil Company were groping in a closed environment from scratch.

	Party Secretary Liú Rénjiē sighed: "Closing leads to stagnation, opening leads to clarity; closing leads to retreat, opening leads to progress. After Bohai Oilfield opened up in 1980, we finally realized this truth!"

	In the past nine years, Bohai Oil Company has completed 400,000 kilometers of offshore seismic lines, 240 offshore wells, discovered 28 oil and gas structures, and proven geological reserves of nearly 300 million tons of oil. In other words, the work completed in the nine years since opening up is more than the total work completed in the previous 15 years. Currently, the Chengbei Oilfield, jointly developed by China and Japan, has been fully put into production. The Bohai Central Cooperation Zone with the United States has completed regional geological evaluation, and the agreement signed with British CP Oil Company and others for joint development of Bohai oil is being implemented. Through providing services and contracting services to foreign oil companies, the entire company has earned $640 million in foreign exchange and $124 million in profits in the past nine years. In 1988, Bohai Oilfield produced more than 400,000 tons of crude oil, equivalent to 2.5 times the highest annual crude oil production before opening up.

	Sincere Cooperation

	During exchanges with foreign oil groups, Bohai Oil Company learned that more than 70% of the world's total foreign investment is mutual investment among developed countries; the remaining 30% is investment in developing countries, mainly concentrated in South Korea, Singapore, Argentina, Brazil, and Hong Kong. In the nearly $1 trillion of direct investment worldwide each year, the actual share utilized by the Chinese mainland, with a population of over 1 billion, is only 1%.

	Manager Lín Fúyàn of Bohai Oil Transportation Company told the reporter that when providing transportation services to employees of foreign oil groups, they found that in recent years, some large enterprises in the world have continued to emphasize advanced science and technology and strict management control methods, while also paying attention to absorbing the essence of Chinese Confucian culture and combining it with their own national characteristics, forming a value system centered on integrity. This enterprise culture model, which integrates Eastern and Western elements, makes these large enterprises have strong external adaptability and internal cohesion.

	Connecting the share of China's utilization of foreign capital and the value system of some foreign large enterprises, Bohai Oil Company proposed: to cooperate more sincerely with oil groups from various countries, promoting the flow of foreign capital to Bohai.

	The geological conditions of the Bohai Sea are complex, with various rock layers intersecting horizontally and vertically, and large and small oilfields layered upon each other, like a broken plate, each piece containing oil and gas, but also separated from each other. When the French Elf-Aquitaine Oil Company first came to Bohai to find oil, due to their limited understanding of the geological conditions of the sea area, the well positions they selected happened to be in areas where Bohai Oil Company had repeatedly explored and determined to have little hope. Starting from sincerity, Bohai Oil Company honestly informed the French side of the situation and suggested they choose another well position, avoiding the loss of francs into the sea. The French side highly appreciated this, and even after the completion of all contract executions, French colleagues still happily visit Bohai Oilfield every year, always remembering the Chinese people who keep their word.

	Flexible Measures

	Currently, the mutual influence and interdependence of various countries' economies are deepening, making the decision-makers of Bohai Oil Company increasingly feel that if the foreign oil companies participating in cooperation in Bohai do not make a profit, the cooperation will collapse, which is a loss for both sides. How to protect the interests of the company while also protecting the interests of the cooperation partner? How to take more flexible measures around common interests? They have been exploring this for years. Deputy General Manager Lǐ Bǐngquán mentioned that during the joint development of the Chengbei Oilfield by China and Japan, the Chinese side took the initiative to improve the investment recovery method.

	To explore oil and gas in Bohai, the Japanese side invested more than $600 million in risk investment. To develop the Chengbei Oilfield, both China and Japan jointly invested more than $200 million in development investment that should be recovered. Bohai Oil Company, to ensure that the Japanese side can make a profit, with the approval of relevant state departments, changed the original contract's simultaneous recovery of both parties' development investment to first recover the Japanese side's development investment. Don't underestimate this change. In the past two years, despite the decline in international oil prices and the sluggish global oil industry, several oil companies from Japan, the United States, and Britain were still attracted to Bohai Oilfield. One of the reasons is: in terms of recovering oilfield development investment, Bohai Oil Company can put itself in the shoes of the cooperation partner and think for them.

　　世界经济体系在召唤    
    ——渤海石油公司部分干部谈对外开放
    本报记者  鹿舫
    对比看差距
    渤海石油公司的干部对于商品经济的理解越来越深刻了。这是因为他们学会了“横比”和“纵比”。一是拿我国的渤海油田同欧洲的北海油田作对比；二是拿渤海油田对外开放前后作对比。
    公司总经理曹德安说：“我１９８１年前后出国访问时才知道，北海油田和渤海油田是同时起步的。北海油田８０年代初就已能生产１亿吨原油了。而渤海油田到８０年代初尽管已经装备了１０多亿元的设备，但年产原油却不过１０多万吨。造成这么大差距的一个重要原因是人家一直面向世界，而我们过去‘封闭’太久。”
    据统计，在陆上钻一口油井的费用一般不会超过１００万美元，而钻一口海上油井的费用却要８００至１０００万美元。在海上找油，技术比在陆地找油复杂，风险也大，周期更长。因此，世界上绝大多数国家都采取国际合作的方式，进行海上石油勘探、开发。在北海油田参与合作的外国石油公司，仅英国海域就有２００多家，挪威海域也有４０多家。渤海油田呢？１９８０年对外开放前，同国际社会、国际市场相隔绝。当外国石油公司在一个开放体系中用现代化装备加速开发海上石油时，渤海石油公司的职工却在一个封闭的环境里从零开始摸索。
    公司党委书记刘仁杰感叹道：“闭则塞，开则明；闭则退，开则进。１９８０年渤海油田对外开放后，我们总算悟出了这个道理！”
    ９年来，渤海石油公司共完成海上地震测线４０多万公里，海上钻井２４０口，发现含油气构造２８个，探明石油地质储量近３亿吨。也就是说，对外开放９年间完成的工作量比过去１５年中完成的工作量总和还多。眼下，中日合作开发的埕北油田已全部投产，中美渤海中部合作区已完成了区域地质评价，和英国ＣＰ石油公司等签订的共同开发渤海石油的协议，也正在付之实施。通过为外国石油公司提供劳务和开展承包服务，全公司９年来共收入外汇６．４亿美元，创利润１．２４亿元。１９８８年渤海油田产原油４０多万吨，相当于对外开放前原油最高年产量的２．５倍。
    诚恳的合作
    渤海石油公司在同外国石油集团交往时了解到：全世界对外投资总额的７０％以上，是发达国家间的相互投资；另外３０％是对发展中国家的投资，而且主要集中在南朝鲜、新加坡、阿根廷、巴西和香港等国家和地区。在全世界每年近千亿美元的直接投资中，１０多亿人口的中国大陆实际所利用的份额仅占１％。
    渤海石油运输公司经理林福彦告诉记者，他们在为外国石油集团职员提供交通服务时发现，近年来世界上一些大企业一方面继续强调先进的科学技术和严格的管理控制手段，另一方面注意吸取中国儒家文化的精华并结合本民族的特点，形成了一套以信义为核心的价值观体系。这种融东西方于一体的企业文化模式，使得那些大企业具有较强的外部适应力和内部凝聚力。
    把中国利用外资的份额和外国大企业一套“东西合璧”的价值观体系这两点联系起来思索，渤海石油公司提出：要更加诚恳地同各国石油集团合作，促使外资流向渤海。
    渤海海域地质情况复杂，各种岩层纵横交叉，大小油田层层迭迭，好比一个打碎的盘子，块块都含油气，可又互相分离。法国埃尔夫—阿奎坦石油公司刚到渤海找油时，由于对海域地质情况不太了解，所选定的井位恰恰是在渤海石油公司过去经反复勘探而料定没有什么希望的地带。渤海石油公司从以诚待人出发，如实向法方说明了情况，建议他们另选井位，避免了往大海里白扔法郎。对此法方给予高度评价，以致双方合同全部执行完毕后，法国同行每年还乐于来渤海油田作客，始终不忘讲信义的中国人。
    灵活的办法
    当前，各国经济的相互影响和互相依赖日益加深，这使得渤海石油公司的决策层越来越感到，如果在渤海参与合作的外国石油公司不盈利，合作垮台了，既是外方的损失，也是中方的损失。怎样才能既维护本公司的利益，又维护合作伙伴的利益？如何围绕共同利益采取更加灵活的作法？近年来他们一直在摸索。公司副总经理李秉铨提到，中日双方在联合开发渤海埕北油田的过程中，中方主动改进了投资回收方式。
    为在渤海勘探油气，日方花了６亿多美元的风险投资。为开发埕北油田，中日双方又共拿出了应该回收的开发投资２亿多美元。渤海石油公司为了使日方有利可得，经国家有关部门批准，把原合同规定的同时回收双方的开发投资改为先回收日方的开发投资。可别小看这么一改。近两年，尽管国际市场油价下跌，世界石油业不景气，但日本、美国、英国的好几家石油公司仍被吸引到渤海油田。原因之一就是：在回收油田开发投资方面，渤海石油公司能设身处地为合作伙伴着想。
