Brazil's central bank recently announced that, with the approval of the National Monetary Council, Brazil will begin implementing the "tourist dollar" system starting in January. This system aims to legalize the previously illegal dollar black market transactions to recall national currency and reduce the outflow of dollars.

According to the regulations of the aforementioned system, residents applying to travel abroad can purchase up to $4,000 in foreign exchange at the free market price from designated banks, travel agencies, or exchange offices, using their ID cards, tickets, and passports. For medical treatment abroad, the maximum purchase amount can reach $100,000. Designated foreign exchange institutions can also purchase dollars from any foreign tourists within Brazil, with prices negotiated freely, and are allowed to remit the purchased dollars abroad. However, payments for international air tickets will still be exchanged at the official rate, and expenses for government officials or businesspeople traveling abroad for official purposes will be settled at the official rate.

The foreign exchange free market in Brazil has always been very active. Due to the increasing gap between the black market dollar price and the official price (the current difference is 60%), it has driven people to engage in dollar black market transactions or arbitrage to make huge profits. In the past, residents traveling abroad were legally allowed to exchange $1,000 in foreign exchange at the official rate, but many people would resell the exchanged foreign exchange for profit. Statistics show that the Brazilian government loses over $300 million in foreign exchange annually due to this. The official view is that implementing the "tourist dollar" system is the first step in the controlled opening of the foreign exchange market, which is beneficial for rectifying financial order, recalling currency, and reducing foreign exchange outflow.

### 回笼本国货币　减少美元流失  巴西实行“旅游美元”制度

　　回笼本国货币　减少美元流失
    巴西实行“旅游美元”制度
    本报巴西利亚１２月３１日电  记者兰才基报道：巴西中央银行最近宣布，经国家货币委员会核准，巴西将从元月份开始实行“旅游美元”制度。这项制度是使原本非法的美元黑市交易合法化，以便回笼本国货币并减少美元的流失。
    按照上述制度规定，凡申请出国旅游的居民，凭身份证、机票和护照每人可以按自由市场价格向指定的银行、旅行社或兑换所购买４０００美元外汇，如出国治病购买额最多可达到１０万美元；被指定经营外汇的机构也可以向任何在巴西境内的外国游客收购美元，价格自议，并允许将购进的美元汇出国外。但是，购买国际民航机票付款仍按官方牌价兑换，因公出国的政府官员或经商人员所需费用按官价结汇。
    巴西金融市场的外汇自由买卖一直非常活跃，由于黑市美元价与官价差额越拉越大（目前差价已达６０％），因而促使人们从事美元黑市交易或采取套汇等办法牟取暴利。过去，居民出国旅游法定可以按官价兑换１０００美元外汇，但不少人换取外汇以后又转手倒卖从中取利。据统计，巴西政府每年由此而损失的外汇达３亿美元以上。官方认为，实行“旅游美元”制度是有控制的开放外汇市场的第一步，有利于整顿金融秩序，回笼货币，减少外汇流失。
