    Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, January 10 - On January 10, the Central Military Commission's Discipline Inspection Commission issued a notice to the entire military, commending the Logistics Department of the Chengdu Military Region for its self-discipline in resisting improper practices and maintaining integrity.

    This logistics department is responsible for the procurement, supply, and management of various general-purpose materials for the region's troops, including those for war preparedness projects and production maintenance. They are involved in the market and have extensive contact with society. Over the past two years, they have allocated tens of millions of tons of state-planned materials, procured nearly one hundred million tons of materials through multiple channels, and handled over ten million yuan worth of surplus materials, all in accordance with policies and regulations. They have strictly prevented corruption such as bribery and illegal trading. They have used the money and materials under their control entirely for the construction of the troops, and have been repeatedly recognized by the Chengdu Military Region and the Logistics Department of the Military Region as exemplary units for rectifying party style, professional ethics, and administrative management.

    The key to this logistics department's ability to maintain integrity lies in their unwavering commitment to serving the troops, regardless of changes in the environment. They have consistently emphasized education on policies and regulations, and have dared to handle problems seriously when they arise. At the same time, they have implemented effective management systems. They have clearly stipulated that the procurement of materials must pass through the stages of order placement, quality control, and price control; the purchase of materials must strive for the best quality and price, and strict inspections must be conducted upon receipt of goods, with any issues immediately reported; they also strictly manage cash and adhere to financial regulations. They have also increased the transparency of their work, making public the allocation of various material indicators and distribution plans from the headquarters to the troops; the department's rules and work disciplines are also made public, and they voluntarily accept supervision.

    The Military Commission's Discipline Inspection Commission, in its notice, requires all levels of military organizations, especially those departments that manage money and materials, to learn from the experience of the Logistics Department of the Chengdu Military Region. They should conduct self-examinations of their units' integrity, commend advanced examples, correct problems in a timely manner, and seriously deal with those who violate laws and regulations.

　　成都军区后勤部物资部保持清廉
    中央军委纪委予以通报表彰
    新华社北京１月１０日电  中央军委纪委１月１０日向全军发出通报，表彰成都军区后勤部物资部自觉抵制不正之风、保持清正廉洁的事迹。　　
    这个物资部担负全区部队战备工程、生产维修等各类通用物资的筹、供、管任务，参与市场，广泛接触社会。近两年来，他们调拨国家计划物资几十万吨，多渠道筹措物资近百万吨，处理积压物资价值１０００多万元，都按政策纪律办事，严格防止行贿受贿、倒买倒卖等腐败现象发生。他们有权不谋私，把手中掌管的钱和物全部用到部队建设上，先后被成都军区和军区后勤部评为端正党风、职业道德建设和行政管理先进单位。
    这个物资部能够保持清正廉洁，关键是他们做到了无论环境条件如何变化，为部队服务的思想坚定不移，政策纪律教育常抓不懈，发现问题敢于严肃处理。同时，有一套行之有效的管理制度。他们明确规定，筹措物资要把好订货关、质量关、价格关；订购物资要力争优质优价，并严格货物验收，发现问题立即报告；同时，严格现金管理，坚持财经制度。他们还注意增大工作的透明度，总部分配的各种物资指标和分配方案，都向部队公开；本部门办事规则、工作纪律也公诸于众，自觉接受监督。
    军委纪委在通报中要求全军各级机关、特别是管钱管物部门的党组织，都要结合当前正在进行的治理经济环境、整顿经济秩序的工作，学习成都军区后勤部物资部的经验，对照检查本单位保持廉洁作风的情况，发现先进典型加以表扬，有问题及时纠正，对违法乱纪者要严肃处理。
