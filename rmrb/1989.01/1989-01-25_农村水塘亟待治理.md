Rural ponds urgently need treatment

In recent years, some places in my county have neglected the maintenance and repair of ponds, and many ponds have become unusable. For example, a certain township in a village originally had about 70 ponds of various sizes. In recent years, about 20% of the ponds have been filled in, and 30% of the ponds have had their banks collapse. A certain production team in this village originally had 4 ponds, each able to irrigate about 30 acres of farmland on average. Due to long-term neglect, only one pond remains now.

The main reasons for this situation are:

Some places focus only on the construction of large-scale water conservancy projects and neglect the maintenance of existing rural ponds, resulting in many ponds being left unrepaired for years. Some farmers have relied on electric irrigation for farming in recent years and no longer pay attention to the construction and repair of ponds.

Rural ponds play an important role in drought resistance and flood control. It is suggested that relevant departments should not only focus on the construction of water conservancy projects but also pay attention to the maintenance of rural ponds.

### 农村水塘亟待治理

　　农村水塘亟待治理
    近几年，我县农村一些地方忽视了对水塘的兴修治理，许多水塘已经报废了。如某乡有个村原有大小水塘约７０口，近几年约有２０％的水塘被填了，３０％的水塘塘埂倒塌。这个村某组原有４口水塘，每口塘平均约能灌溉３０亩耕地，由于长期没有治理，现在只剩下一口水塘。
    造成这种状况的主要原因是：
    一些地方只注意兴修大型水利工程，忽视了农村原有水塘的治理，致使一些水塘年久失修；一些农民这些年浇地靠电灌，不再注重兴建和整修水塘。
    农村的水塘在抗旱防汛中，起着重要的作用。建议有关部门既要抓好水利工程的建设，也要抓好农村水塘的治理。
