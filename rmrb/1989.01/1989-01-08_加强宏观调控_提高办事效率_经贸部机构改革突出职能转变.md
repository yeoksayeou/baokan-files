    经贸部机构改革突出职能转变
    本报讯  记者陆振华报道：对外经济贸易部机构改革方案最近经国务院批准付诸实施。改革后的经贸部机构把职能转变摆在突出的位置，综合运用经济手段、法律手段和必要的行政手段，加强宏观调控；并调整了机构，精简了人员，全力提高办事效率。
    １０年来的改革开放，使我国对外经济技术合作出现了新的局面。经贸部作为国务院的一个综合管理职能部门，在职能转变中强调宏观调控；政策拟订和实施；组织协调和服务指导。新的机构要完成如下职责：
    ——研究制订发展对外经济贸易的战略方针、规划和国别政策及其他有关政策，并负责组织实施；负责汇总编制或参与编制有关的中长期和年度对外经济贸易计划，并负责对外经济贸易业务的监督管理和统计，组织出口商品生产基地建设，指导对外经贸企业的经营管理；组织协调和指导各地区、各部门的对外经贸工作。
    ——根据国务院的授权，代表政府组织政府间的经济贸易谈判和混合委员会会议，签订多边、双边政府间经贸协定，并组织监督实施；负责组织和协调管理外国政府贷款、外商投资、技术和成套设备进口的对外谈判、签约，审批重大的利用外资和引进技术项目的协议和合同。
    ——发挥综合管理部门的职能，管理对外援助，制定国别援助方案，组织对外经济援助项目的实施和技术合作工作；归口管理对外承包工程和劳务合作及国外经济合作企业；归口管理同国际组织的经济技术合作交流及国际货运代理业务。
    ——研究制订对外经济贸易体制改革方案及配套措施和组织实施；制订有关对外经济贸易管理的法规，并组织监督实施。
    ——负责管理进出口许可证和出口配额，归口审查国内外的对外经贸企业设置等。
    经贸部部长郑拓彬对新机构运行第一年的工作提出要求：要紧紧抓住转变职能这个关键，建立明确的各级干部的岗位责任制；治理和整顿外贸环境和秩序，深化外贸体制改革；采取积极方针，争取明年出口贸易继续稳定增长；继续改善外商投资环境，积极稳妥地利用外商投资，有计划地多争取一些外国政府优惠贷款；积极开拓国际承包工程和劳务合作市场；继续做好对外援助工作，并争取国外的经济技术援助。
