The People's Daily, January 21st, from our reporters Jia Jianzhou and Song Xuechun.

Shandong Province, while arranging its economic work for this year, has both fully affirmed its achievements and seriously addressed its difficulties, determined to adjust its industrial policies and ensure effective supply.

In 1988, Shandong Province's economic life saw some prominent issues that could not be ignored. Apart from inflation, the main problems were: a decrease in the production of grains, cotton, and oil, which brought many disadvantages to urban and rural life; the severe water shortage caused by consecutive years of drought, which posed a serious threat to production and construction; and the shortages of coal, steel, electricity, and other energy and raw materials, as well as financial difficulties, which greatly constrained economic development.

In arranging its economic work for this year, Shandong Province has proposed the guiding ideology of "developing while rectifying, invigorating while rectifying, and advancing through reform and opening up." It has also determined that: the scale of fixed asset investment should be reduced, while agriculture, energy, transportation, and raw material industries should be guaranteed; excessive demand should be tightened, while effective supply should be increased; price and wage reforms should be slowed down, but enterprise reforms should be deepened; credit scale and currency issuance should be controlled, and consumption funds should be transformed. Based on repeated calculations, it has been initially determined that: the national gross output value will increase by 8% compared to last year, national income will increase by 7.5%, the total industrial and agricultural output value will increase by 10.2% (with agriculture increasing by 3.5% and industry by 12%), and fiscal revenue will increase by 8%.

To achieve the above goals, the main measures taken by Shandong Province are as follows: Firstly, great efforts will be made to adjust the industrial and product structure to ensure effective supply. They have listed the products that need to be increased or reduced. The province will ensure the increased production of 202 key products, restrict the production of 32 products, and decide to eliminate a batch of products with low quality, poor performance, and high energy consumption. Secondly, in response to the problem of insufficient agricultural momentum, efforts will be made from all aspects to increase investment. The province plans to allocate 1.2 billion yuan for agriculture through various channels, an increase of 30% compared to last year; local foreign exchange will be used to import 100 million US dollars worth of agricultural materials, accounting for 1/6 of the province's foreign exchange, an increase of 14% compared to last year. Thirdly, in response to the problems of insufficient raw materials and funds, solutions will be sought through internal potential and external coordination. To solve the problem of a 600-million-ton coal shortage this year, the province has determined to address it through four channels: tapping the potential of coal mines to increase production, reducing the transportation of local coal, increasing the allocation of coal from other provinces, and promoting enterprise energy conservation. Currently, the total deposits and cash held by urban and rural residents and enterprises in the province amount to approximately 48 billion yuan. The province plans to take measures to attract as much of this funds as possible into production and construction.

### 精心组织经济工作确保有效供给  山东下决心调整产业政策  增加农业投入设法解决原材料资金不足等困难

　　精心组织经济工作确保有效供给    
    山东下决心调整产业政策    
    增加农业投入设法解决原材料资金不足等困难
    本报济南１月２１日电  记者贾建舟、宋学春报道：山东省在安排今年经济工作时，既充分肯定成绩又认真正视困难，决心调整产业政策，保证有效供给。
    １９８８年，山东省的经济生活出现了一些不容忽视的突出问题。除了通货膨胀以外，主要表现在：粮棉油等农作物减产，给城乡生活带来了诸多不利；连年大旱酿成的水源奇缺，对生产建设构成了严重威胁；煤炭、钢材、电力等能源、原材料的缺口以及资金的困难，对经济发展造成很大制约。
    山东省在安排今年经济工作时，提出了“在治理中发展，在整顿中搞活，在改革开放中前进”的指导思想，并确定：固定资产投资规模要压缩，农业、能源、交通、原材料工业要保证；过旺的需求要收紧，有效的供给要增加；物价工资改革放慢一步，但企业改革要深化；信贷规模、货币发行要控制，消费基金要转化。根据反复测算，初步确定：国民生产总值比上年增长８％，国民收入增长７．５％，工农业总产值增长１０．２％（其中农业增长３．５％，工业增长１２％），财政收入增长８％。
    为实现上述目标，山东省所采取的主要对策是：其一，下大气力调整产业产品结构，确保有效供给。他们把该保该压的产品逐个排出了单子。省里确保增产的重点产品有２０２种，限制生产的有３２种，同时还决定砍掉一批质量低、性能差、耗能高的产品。其二，针对农业后劲不足的问题，从各个方面加大投入。全省各条渠道用于农业的资金投入计划安排１２亿元，比上一年增长３０％；地方外汇安排进口农用物资１亿美元，占全省外汇的１／６，比上一年增长１４％。其三，针对原材料、资金不足的问题，通过内部挖潜、外部协调等办法加以解决。为解决今年６００多万吨煤炭的缺口，省里确定从挖掘煤矿增产潜力、减少地方煤炭外运、增调省外协作煤炭、开展企业节能等四条渠道予以解决。目前，全省城乡居民和企业存款及手持现金约达４８０多亿元，省里拟采取措施尽可能把其中一部分资金吸引到生产建设上来。
