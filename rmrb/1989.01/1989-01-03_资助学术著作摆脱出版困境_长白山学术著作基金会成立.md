For academic publications to break out of their publishing difficulties, the Jilin Provincial Press and Publication Bureau has raised over one million yuan to establish the Changbai Mountain Academic Publications Fund.

Since the Third Plenary Session of the Eleventh Central Committee, Jilin Province has published many valuable academic works that have been praised by experts and scholars. However, in recent years, due to significant price increases in raw materials like paper and a sharp decline in book sales, the publication of academic works, which are highly specialized, have small print runs, and incur large economic losses, has become even more difficult.

The "Changbai Mountain Academic Publications Fund," established during the comprehensive deepening of publishing reforms, is a social organization. The fund's initial capital of 10 million yuan was collected from provincial-level publishing houses, and it accepts voluntary donations from individuals and organizations both domestically and internationally. The fund committee, composed of renowned experts and scholars from various fields, aims to support the publication of academic works and reward outstanding authors and translators.

The fund will support works in philosophy, social sciences, natural sciences, engineering technology, culture, education, literature, art, and children's literature, with priority given to works of high academic value and enduring significance. It will also reward authors and translators whose academic publications have achieved good social effects in the province. Currently, the seven publishing houses under the bureau have begun collecting outstanding academic works from various disciplines nationwide.

　　资助学术著作摆脱出版困境
    长白山学术著作基金会成立
    新华社长春１月２日电  （通讯员赵玉秋、记者马启智）为使学术著作出版走出困境，吉林省新闻出版局筹资百万余元，于最近成立了长白山学术著作出版基金会。
    党的十一届三中全会以来，吉林省出版了许多有价值的学术著作，受到专家学者好评。但是，近年来由于纸张等原材料大幅度涨价，图书发行数量锐减，专业性强，发行数量少，经济亏损大的学术著作，出版更加困难。
    在全面深化出版改革中创建的“长白山学术著作出版基金会”是社会性组织，资金来源由省直的出版社集资１００万元作为底数，接受国内外个人或团体自愿捐赠。由各界有名望的专家学者组成的基金委员会，旨在资助学术著作出版，并奖励优秀著译者。
    基金资助对象，包括哲学、社会科学、自然科学、工程技术、文化、教育、文学、艺术、儿童少年读物等方面，优先资助学术水平高、又有保留价值的著作，并奖励在这个省出版学术著作取得良好社会效益的著译者。目前，隶属这个局的七家出版社，已开始在全国征集各学科的优秀学术著作。
