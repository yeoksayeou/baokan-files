In mid-November 1988, I set out from Haikou City and traveled along the eastern and eastern auxiliary lines of Hainan Island. Through the car window, I saw patch after patch of abandoned farmland flashing by; herds of cattle and sheep were grazing on the lush grass in the fields.

Now, there is too much abandoned farmland in Hainan." During the 110-plus kilometers of my trip, I witnessed 29 patches of abandoned farmland, totaling about 800 mu.

　　海南一些地方粮田抛荒严重
    １９８８年１１月中旬，我从海口市出发，沿海南岛东线和东副线采访，看到一块块荒芜的粮田不断从车窗外闪过；一群群牛羊在田里吃着茂盛的青草。在文昌县文城镇附近一个水塘边，一位老农告诉我：“近几年，种田人都进城经商赚大钱了，许多人都不愿干农活啦！现在，海南荒芜的粮田太多了。”在行程１１０多公里的采访中，我目睹到荒芜的粮田共有２９处，约８００亩。
