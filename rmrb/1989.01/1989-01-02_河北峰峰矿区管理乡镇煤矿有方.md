How to strengthen the management and rectification of township coal mines, and establish a new order of coordinated development between large and small mines? The Fengfeng Mining District in Hebei Province has adopted a method of joint management by local governments and state-owned coal mines, achieving remarkable results and drawing the attention of the Ministry of Energy.

The Fengfeng Mining District is an important coking coal production area in China. It has both the Fengfeng Mining Bureau, which produces over 10 million tons of coal annually, and 185 township small coal mines, producing over 240 million tons of coal annually. In the past few years, due to the lack of strict management measures for township coal mines, there has been rampant illegal mining. Between 1984 and 1985, there were 154 resource disputes between large and small mines, resulting in economic losses of 3 million yuan, and seriously affecting the safety of large mines. To address this problem and strengthen the management of township coal mines, the local government and the mining bureau jointly established the Fengfeng Mining District Joint Management Committee for Local Coal Mines.

The Joint Management Committee acts impartially and has conducted a classification and rectification of the 185 township small coal mines that have been established in the district. It has already closed down 5 small mines that do not meet the conditions for mining and pose a threat to the safety of large mines. For 24 small mines that meet the mining conditions, it has delineated mining boundaries and completed the necessary procedures. For small coal mines that engage in illegal mining and do not comply with the decisions of the Joint Management Committee, the committee has taken decisive legal measures, imposing fines where necessary and closing down mines that violate regulations.

　　河北峰峰矿区管理乡镇煤矿有方
    本报讯  记者刘燮阳报道：如何加强对乡镇煤矿的管理整顿，建立起大、小矿协调发展的矿业新秩序？河北峰峰矿区采取地方政府和国营煤矿联合管理的办法，取得了明显成效，受到了能源部的重视。
    峰峰矿区是我国焦煤重要产地。这里既有年产１０００万吨以上的峰峰矿务局，还有１８５个乡镇小煤矿，年产煤２４０多万吨。前几年，由于对乡镇煤矿缺乏严格管理措施，乱采滥掘现象严重。仅１９８４、１９８５年两年间，大、小矿之间发生资源纠纷１５４起，经济损失达３００万元，还严重影响大矿的安全。为解决这一问题，加强对乡镇煤矿的管理，当地政府和矿务局联合成立了峰峰矿区地方煤矿联合管理委员会。
    联管会秉公办事，对全区已开办的１８５个村镇小煤矿分类进行了清理整顿。现已关闭了５个不具备办矿条件和危及大矿安全的小矿，对２４个符合开采条件的小矿划定了矿界、补办了手续。对乱采滥掘，不服从联管会决议的小煤矿，坚决依法治理，该罚款的罚款，该关闭的关闭。
