The wines of Romania are intoxicating. On the eve of the New Year, the *Spark* newspaper and comrades from the Yași County Committee arranged for us to visit the famous Cotnari Agricultural-Industrial Combine winery in Yași County, which deepened our impression.

This is truly a world of grapes and wine. Looking out, the rows of harvested grapes stretch like brown ribbons across the hills to the horizon. The decorations in the rooms are all related to grapes and wine. On the wall by the door, there is a carefully carved wine barrel lid, with the Roman god of wine, Bacchus, in the center. Around it are records of the winery's glorious history: In 1961, it won the Yugoslav International Wine Grand Prize; in 1966, it took the top prize in the Hungarian wine competition; in 1968, it won an award in the Bucharest International Wine Competition; and it has also made an appearance in Vienna.

The general manager, Moraru Valentin, who has worked here for 30 years, and the chief engineer and party secretary, Teodor, received us. The people of Cotnari have a long history of growing grapes and making wine. People once thought that the vineyards here were established by Prince Stephen, but in fact, he only renovated and updated the gardens, inviting some experts from the Mediterranean coast to teach the techniques. Moraru said that this place is located at 47.2 degrees north latitude, and such large-scale grape cultivation in Europe is the northernmost. Further north, there is none, but the clever people of Cotnari have grown grapes here at high latitudes that are as fragrant and refreshing as those from the Mediterranean coast. Now, the vineyards cover 2,000 hectares, producing more than 10,000 tons of fine wine annually, most of which is exported, with a small portion sold domestically. Among the many varieties, the wines "Cotnari Fatso" and "White Lady" are the most famous.

Wine production for this year has already ended, and only a few workers are left in the workshop to maintain the machines and classify the wine. After turning a few corners and passing through three doors, we smelled a special wine aroma, indicating that we had reached the underground wine cellar. This is a 100-meter-long underground corridor, with 15 wine cellars, each 75 meters deep, on either side. Opening the fourth door, we saw 34 large oak barrels neatly lined up on either side of the cellar, with a row of smaller wooden barrels on top of the large ones. The large barrels hold 5,000 liters, and the small ones hold 1,500 liters. The lids of the barrels are marked with the type and production date of the wine inside. The general manager said that in addition to the exquisite craftsmanship of winemaking, it is also necessary to maintain a constant temperature, with ideal temperature, ventilation equipment, and sanitary conditions, all of which the winery has.

The wine, after being produced in October and November, is taken out and classified. The best quality wine is placed in the cellar to be stored for 3 years, then a stabilizer is added, and it is bottled and moved to the adjacent cellar. This cellar is structurally identical to the first one, with large wooden racks divided into small square compartments, each of which can hold 12 bottles of wine laid horizontally. Horizontal placement allows the cork to expand, creating a better seal. The host said this is the largest cellar in Romania and one of the largest in Europe, storing over 5,000 tons of wine. Standing at the entrance and looking inside, we saw countless bottle necks glowing blue in the dim light. Moraru whispered, "Wine needs darkness and quiet to age. Let them sleep, and it's best not to disturb the wine god."

In a room with a grapevine decoration on the ceiling, the host invited us to taste the wine. In front of each person, there were 5 glasses of different colors of wine, arranged from tallest to shortest. The host introduced each type of wine one by one. The third glass was golden yellow, a "Cotnari Fatso" that had been aged for 20 years, smelling like walnuts, tasting like honey, and with a slight almond flavor when savored. "The more fragrant, the later it is placed," Moraru said as he raised the last glass, "This is brandy, distilled from one of the previous four wines and aged for 8 years. It can compete with many famous wines from abroad." After saying this, he raised his glass and toasted, "Nolac" (meaning "bottoms up"). He has been dealing with wine for 30 years, not only is his winemaking craftsmanship exquisite, but he is also a heavy drinker. While we had all become "uncle Guans" long ago.

Between tasting the wine, dish after dish of local delicacies were served, including grape leaves wrapped with mutton. The meat is produced here. This combine also has a sheep farm with a stock of 12,000 sheep, one of the largest sheep farms in Romania. The host proudly introduced that the farm has also won the title of "New Banner of Romania."

The reason why the Cotnari Agricultural-Industrial Combine can make significant contributions to the country is mainly because it has a well-trained workforce. The 600 employees are all graduates of vocational schools or above. The 9 branch managers are all planting experts, and the sheep farm also has two experts. Additionally, there are two senior planting experts and a small research institute. They often work together to research and solve production problems.

　　葡萄美酒“诺乐克”
    本报记者  赵绍棣
    罗马尼亚的葡萄酒是醉人的。新年前夕，《火花报》和雅西县委的同志安排我们访问著名的雅西县科特拉利农工联合企业酒厂之后，更加深了这一印象。
    这真是一个葡萄与酒的世界。放眼远望，垄垄采摘后的葡萄尤如条条褐色的彩带，延伸到丘陵的远方。房间里的装饰都与葡萄和酒有关。门口墙上镶着一个精心雕刻的酒桶盖，正中是罗马神话里的酒神巴库斯，像周围记录了酒厂的光荣历程：１９６１年获南斯拉夫酒类国际大奖，１９６６年在匈牙利酒类评比中夺魁，１９６８年布加勒斯特国际酒类评比时又中奖，在维也纳也曾露过头角。
    在这儿工作了３０年的总经理莫拉路·瓦列恩丁和总工程师兼党委书记特奥多尔接待了我们。科特拉利人种葡萄酿酒有悠久的历史，人们曾认为当地的葡萄园是斯特凡大公建起的，实际上，他仅对园林进行过改造、更新，从地中海沿岸请来一些种植能手传授技艺。莫拉路说，这儿地处北纬４７．２度，如此大规模种植葡萄在欧洲这是最北的地方，再往北就没有了，但聪明的科特拉利人却在高纬度的地方种出了与地中海沿岸一样清香、爽口的葡萄。现在种植园共有２０００公顷葡萄，年产万余吨美酒，多数供出口，少数内销。众多的品种中，其中以“科特拉利胖子”和“白姑娘”两种酒最负盛名。
    今年酿酒已经结束，车间里只有少数几个工人照看机器，对酒进行分类。转弯拐角地往下走过三道门，闻到一股特殊的酒味后，已到地下酒库，这是个长１００米的地下长廊，两边共有１５个深７５米的酒库。打开第四号门，只见库里两边分别整齐地横列着３４个橡木酒桶，大桶上又放着一排小木桶，大桶容积５０００升，小桶１５００升。桶盖上标着里面装的酒的品种、出产日期。总经理说，酿酒除了要精湛的工艺外，还必须保持恒温，有理想的温度、完善的通风设备和卫生条件，这些酒厂都具备了。酿好的酒在１０—１２月时抽出来分类，质量最好的放在地窖里存放３年，再加稳定剂后装瓶并挪到相邻的地窖。这个地窖与第一个构造完全相同，排列的大木架分成一个个小方格，每格可横放１２瓶酒，横放能使瓶塞膨胀，更好地密封。主人说这是罗马尼亚最大的地窖，也是欧洲最大的地窖之一，共存酒５０００多吨。站在入口处向里望去，只见无数瓶颈在微弱的灯光下闪着蓝光。莫拉路悄声说，“酒陈化时要黑暗、安静，让它们睡吧，最好别搅了酒神。”
    在一间顶上装饰着葡萄架的房间里，主人请我们品酒。每人面前摆着５个由高到低的玻璃杯，盛着不同颜色的５种酒。主人一一介绍各种酒的成份。第三杯金黄色，是陈放了２０年的“科特拉利胖子”，闻着像核桃味儿，饮着像蜂蜜，回味时略带杏味。“越香越放在后边”，莫拉路边说边举起最后一杯酒，“这是白兰地，是从前４种酒之一蒸馏出来再陈放８年，它可与国外许多名酒媲美。”说完举杯祝大家“诺乐克”（意干杯）。他与酒打了３０年交道，不仅酿造工艺精，饮酒也是海量。而我们大都早已成了“关公”。
    品酒之间，一道道当地风味菜端了上来，其中有葡萄叶卷羊肉。肉是自产的。这个联合企业还有一个存栏１．２万头羊的养殖场，是罗马尼亚存栏羊数最多的养殖场之一。主人自豪地介绍，养殖场还得过“罗马尼亚新旗手”称号。
    科特拉利农工总联合企业之所以能为国家作出重要贡献，主要是因为有一支训练有素的职工队伍。６００名工作人员都是中专以上学校毕业。９个分场长都是种植专家，养殖场也有两名专家，同时还有两名高级种植专家和一个小型研究所，他们经常共同研究，解决生产中的问题。
