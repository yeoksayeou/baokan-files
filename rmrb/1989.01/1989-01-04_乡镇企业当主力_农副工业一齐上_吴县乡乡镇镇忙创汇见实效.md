The development of export-oriented economy in Wuxian County, Jiangsu Province, has made a breakthrough. In the first 11 months of last year, 116 new export products were developed, achieving a total export procurement value of 410 million yuan, an increase of 1.88 times over the same period the previous year.

Townships and towns are busy creating foreign exchange, which is a distinctive feature of Wuxian County's rapid development in foreign trade production. Since last year, Wuxian County has implemented the economic development strategy for coastal regions, vigorously developing the export-oriented economy as a breakthrough for economic development. A series of incentive policies and preferential measures have been formulated to encourage the creation of foreign exchange, mobilizing the enthusiasm of townships, towns, villages, and factories to develop export-oriented production. Chefang Township cultivates rush grass, processes it into "tatami" and woven mats, and exports them to the Japanese market, which is well-received. In the previous year, they earned 300 million US dollars in foreign exchange. Last year, they continued to leverage this traditional advantage and worked hard to develop new export products such as silk garments, silver needles, and latex gloves. From January to November, they achieved a procurement value of 12.98 million yuan, and it is estimated that the full year can earn 450 million US dollars in foreign exchange. Located at the junction of Changshu, Wuxi, and Wuxian counties (cities), Beiqiao Township has relatively poor conditions, but they mobilized each village and factory to conduct a survey and selection of products that can be exported, increasing the number of new export products by 12 varieties. The number of foreign trade enterprises increased from 6 in the previous year to 18, and the export volume reached 13.45 million yuan, an increase of 4.51 times over the same period the previous year. Last year, 34 townships in this county each had foreign exchange earning projects, and currently, the number of townships with an export volume exceeding 10 million yuan has increased from 2 to 8.

In the Taihu Lake area, fruits, tea, and other products enjoy a good reputation in the international market. They have organized the export of whitebait, water chestnuts, plums, and Biluochun tea. Last year, Xishan Town alone exported 4.8 tons of Biluochun tea, 146 tons of whitebait, 8.8 tons of chestnuts, 496 tons of salted plums, and 215 tons of plum pulp, directly achieving a procurement value of 8.52 million yuan. Guangfu, Dongzhu, Zhenhu, and Tong'an Townships have a long history of embroidery, enjoying a high reputation internationally. Under the unified planning of the county, they have formed an embroidery group led by Wuxian Embroidery Factory, with township embroidery distribution stations as the base and 100,000 embroidery women as the main force. Their products are sold in more than 30 countries and regions including Japan, France, and Norway.

    乡乡镇镇忙创汇，是吴县外贸生产跨大步的一大特色。去年以来，吴县把实施沿海地区经济发展战略，大力发展外向型经济作为经济上新台阶的突破口，先后制订了一系列鼓励出口创汇的奖励政策和优惠措施，调动乡乡镇镇、村村厂厂发展出口创汇的积极性。车坊乡种植蔺草，加工成“榻榻咪”和提花席，出口日本市场受青睐，前年创汇３００万美元。去年他们继续发挥这一传统优势，同时千方百计开发丝绸服装、银针和乳胶手套等出口新品，１—１１月就创人民币收购额１２９８万元，预计全年可创汇４５０万美元。地处常熟、无锡、吴县三县（市）交界处的北桥乡，条件比较差，但他们发动各村各厂对可供出口的产品进行摸底排队和筛选，一下子增加出口新品１２种，外贸企业从前年的６家发展到１８家，出口额发展到１３４５万元，比前年同期增长４．５１倍。去年这个县３４个乡镇中个个有出口创汇项目，目前外贸出口额超千万元的已由去年的２个发展到８个。
    太湖之滨的东西山地区，花果、茶叶在国际市场上享有较好声誉，他们就大力组织白果、莼菜、梅子和碧螺春茶出口，单西山镇去年就出口碧螺春茶４．８吨、白果１４６吨、板栗８．８吨，盐渍梅４９６吨，梅坯２１５吨，直接创人民币收购额８５２万元。光福、东渚、镇湖、通安等乡镇的刺绣历史悠久，在国际上享有盛誉，在县里的统一规划下，组成以吴县刺绣总厂为龙头，各乡镇刺绣发放站为基础，１０万绣女为主力的刺绣集团，产品畅销日本、法国、挪威等３０多个国家和地区。
