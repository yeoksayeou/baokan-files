	Hope More People Participate in Sanda Training
	— An Interview with Beijing Sports University Wushu Instructor Zhu Ruiqi

	The head judge for the National Defensive Martial Arts Sanda Elite Competition is Zhu Ruiqi, a teacher from Beijing Sports University who has been engaged in sanda teaching and research for many years. He has conducted in-depth research on sanda competition rules and judging rules, and has valuable insights. After this major competition ended, our reporter interviewed him.

	Zhu Ruiqi, the head judge, said that his overall impression of this competition is that there were many participating teams, both from local areas and the military. The levels of competition were also quite comprehensive, with both men and women participating, attracting a large audience. This shows that sanda is becoming increasingly popular.

	Zhu Ruiqi believes that in this competition, the athletes demonstrated a spirit of daring to fight and compete, especially the newly formed teams. For example, the Dalian team, which has been established for less than a year, dared to compete with strong opponents and achieved good results. This is the spirit that sanda competitions should promote. Another feature is that athletes generally dared to perform offensive moves, such as sweeping kicks and reverse hooks.

	Compared to wushu routines, sanda is relatively young and has many areas that need improvement. This competition had two shortcomings: one is that some teams had poor defensive techniques and often took passive hits. The other is that their ability to withstand blows was weak, especially after taking heavy hits, some could not hold on.

	In conclusion, Zhu Ruiqi, the head judge, shared some of his thoughts. He hopes that in the future, more new teams will emerge to strengthen the sanda ranks.

	Another point is to make the rules more perfect, and the referees' enforcement should be decisive and firm, with safety as the top priority. He said that emphasizing safety in this competition is correct. Sports competitions should be beneficial to physical health. The idea of canceling protective gear and allowing attacks on any part of the body is neither beneficial to health nor to the development of sanda.

　　望更多的人参加散打训练
    ——访北京体院武术教师朱瑞琪
    担任全国防卫技击武术散打精英赛的总裁判长是北京体院多年从事散打教学研究的朱瑞琪老师。他曾对散打竞赛规则和裁判规则等作过深入研究，颇有见解。在这次大赛结束时，记者采访了他。
    朱瑞琪总裁判长说，对这次大赛的总体印象是参加队多、面广，既有地方的又有军队的，参赛的级别也较全，有男有女，吸引观众。这说明武术散打越来越受到欢迎。
    朱瑞琪认为，这次比赛运动员表现出敢打敢拚的精神，新建队尤其突出。如大连队建队不到一年，他们的选手敢于和强手拚，并取得好成绩，这是散打比赛需要提倡的精神。还有一个特点，就是普遍敢做进攻动作，如扫腿、转身后摆腿等。
    比起武术套路来，散打毕竟较年轻，还有许多要加强的地方。这次比赛有两点不足，一个是有些队防守技术差，常常被动挨打。另一个是抗打能力差，尤其是身体受重击后，有的坚持不住。
    朱瑞琪总裁判长最后谈了一些想法。他希望今后有更多的新队出现，壮大散打队伍。
    再一个是要使规则更加完善，裁判执法要坚决果断，把安全放在首位。他说这次比赛强调安全是对的。体育比赛要有利于人体健康，那种要求取消护具，并可以攻击人体任何部位的说法，既不利于健康，也不利于散打运动的发展。
