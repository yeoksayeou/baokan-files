The various levels of the Agricultural Bank of China and credit cooperatives in Hunan Province have correctly implemented the state's policies of controlling currency and credit in the process of rectifying the financial environment. They have firmly compressed what needs to be compressed and made every effort to preserve what needs to be preserved, effectively supporting the stable development of the rural economy. By the end of December 1988, the total credit scale and various sub-items of the provincial agricultural banking system were all controlled within the state-approved plans; the main tasks of loan issuance for grain, oil, and tobacco procurement were all overfulfilled. The total income of township enterprises in the province reached 21.43 billion yuan, with a loan investment income ratio of 1:8.5, and export earnings amounted to 512 million yuan.

Last year, the provincial Agricultural Bank of China and credit cooperatives conducted a comprehensive audit of credit assets from top to bottom throughout the system. Based on a thorough investigation, understanding of the situation, and identification of problems, they adopted decisive measures such as branch managers taking responsibility for specific items, issuing directives to compress tasks, suspending loan issuance, imposing interest penalties, and holding responsible leaders accountable. They promptly cleaned up, halted, and postponed 107 non-production projects, compressing the loan scale by 547 million yuan. The Changsha City Tianqin Feed Company originally planned to build a poultry cold storage processing plant with an annual capacity of 30 million birds and had signed a machinery equipment contract with relevant departments. Upon learning that the Changsha Meat Processing Plant could handle this processing task, the municipal Agricultural Bank canceled the project, saving an investment of 50 million yuan. In addition, various levels of the Agricultural Bank conducted credit rating assessments for more than 87,000 enterprises with loans, implementing a "bottom-up" approach for 795 third and fourth-class enterprises, cleaning up and recovering loans totaling 374 million yuan, and promoting the adjustment of the industrial structure of township enterprises.

While implementing macroeconomic control, the provincial agricultural banking system has focused on supporting agricultural production and the procurement of agricultural and sideline products. They have also gone to great lengths to raise 354 million yuan to prioritize the support of 254 export-earning enterprises led by traditional processing and food processing industries, enabling 237 high-quality products to enter the international market. They have supported the establishment of 37 comprehensive development bases for vegetables, poultry farming, and food processing in the suburban areas of six prefecture-level cities. They have also supported the construction of 205 lean meat pig bases in 15 key grain-producing counties and the excavation and renovation of more than 33,700 mu of intensive fish ponds in the Dongting Lake area, significantly increasing the province's pork export rate and fresh fish commodity rate.

　　压缩投资同调整结构相结合
    湖南农行宏观调控不搞一刀切
    本报讯  湖南省各级农业银行和信用社在治理金融环境中，正确执行国家控制货币、控制信贷的方针，该压的坚决压，该保的尽力保，有效地支持了农村经济的稳定发展。截至１９８８年１２月，全省农行系统信贷总规模和各分项规模都控制在国家核定的计划之内；主要投放贷款的粮食、食油、烟草收购任务都超额完成。全省乡镇企业总收入达２１４．３亿元，贷款投资收入为１∶８．５，出口创汇５．１２亿元。
    去年，该省农业银行和信用社在全系统自上而下地开展了信贷资产大检查，在全面普查，摸清家底，找准问题的基础上，对信贷超规模的地区，采取行长分项包干，指令下达压缩任务，停放贷款，加罚利息，追究主管领导责任等果断措施，及时清理、停建、缓建非生产性项目１０７个，压缩贷款规模５．４７亿元。长沙市天沁饲料公司原计划新建一座年加工能力３００万只的家禽冷冻加工厂，并与有关部门草签了机械设备合同。市农行了解到长沙肉联厂现有设备可以承担此项加工任务，便砍掉了这个项目，节约投资５００万元。此外，各级农业银行还对８７０００多个有贷企业进行了信用等级评估，对７９５家三四类企业实行釜底抽薪，清理收回贷款３．７４亿元，促进了乡镇企业产业结构的调整。
    全省农行系统在执行宏观调控的同时，突出支持农业生产，农副产品收购，还千方百计筹资３．５４亿元，优先扶持了２５４个以传统加工和食品加工业为龙头的出口创汇企业，使２３７种优质产品打入国际市场；支持省辖６市郊区建立３７个蔬菜种植、家禽饲养、食品加工等综合发展的副食品生产基地；支持１５个重点产粮县新建了２０５个瘦肉型猪基地，支持洞庭湖区新挖、改造了３３７００多亩精养鱼池，大大提高了全省牲猪出口率和鲜鱼商品率。
