	Li Lingwei will never forget this day. Flipping through the world badminton grand prix results, Li Lingwei has been at the top of the women's singles rankings since 1983. The 18-year-old South Korean girl, Lee Young-sook, is still a high school student. She became the champion by defeating Han Aiping in last year's Hong Kong Open. The two strong players met, and fans watched eagerly.

	The curtain rose, and Li Lingwei, with two previous victories over her opponent, did not fully perform in the first set, losing to Lee Young-sook 11-6. After one set, Li Lingwei got nervous. In the second set, she took advantage of her height to frequently smash the ball. Her opponent was agile and handled it well, seizing the opportunity to counterattack. The scoreboard showed Li Lingwei trailing 5-9.

	The situation was tense! Li Lingwei used all her strength, defending from all directions, and finally managed to tie the score at 9-9. Then, Lee Young-sook lost two consecutive points, and Li Lingwei won the second set 12-11 with great difficulty.

	During the interval, the coach quickly gave Li Lingwei tactical advice. Lee Young-sook sat alone, panting. The decisive third set began. Li Lingwei attacked fiercely, leading 4-0 from the start, with a slight smile on her face. However, a moment of carelessness allowed Lee Young-sook to catch up to 4-4. The situation became tense again. Li Lingwei played cautiously but failed to smash two consecutive shots over the net. She hesitated to hit a few balls, falling behind 8-10. Lee Young-sook seemed to be on the verge of victory. Li Lingwei hit a smash that hit the top of the net and bounced to Lee Young-sook's side. Lee Young-sook regretfully shrugged at her teammate, making a cute gesture. Li Lingwei ultimately lost to Lee Young-sook and missed the chance to win the championship.

	After the match, Coach Chen Fushou said that Lee Young-sook had made rapid progress, and South Korean players had become the main rivals of the Chinese team. As for Li Lingwei losing this match, it did not mean she was on a downward slope. As her coach, he still had confidence in her.

	Li Lingwei had just taken off her gear when the press room was ready to celebrate her 25th birthday. The president of the International Badminton Federation and dozens of Chinese and foreign journalists sang "Happy Birthday." Li Lingwei, who had just lost the match, burst into tears upon seeing this, covering her face with a towel. Amidst laughter and tears, she said intermittently, "Today I am very excited. I will always remember this day."

　　李玲蔚忘不了这一天
    翻开世界羽毛球大奖赛成绩册，李玲蔚自１９８３年以来赫然女单榜首。年仅１８岁的南朝鲜小姑娘李英淑仍是一名中学生，她在去年的香港公开赛中击败韩爱平而成为冠军。两强相遇，球迷注目。
    战幕拉开，李玲蔚挟过去两胜对手的纪录，第一局没有充分发挥开来，被李英淑以１１∶６拔得头筹。一仗下来，李玲蔚急了，第二局借身高优势频频扣杀。对方动作灵巧，应付自如，并伺机反攻。比分牌上，李玲蔚以５∶９落后。
    局势险峻！李玲蔚使出浑身解数，左右前后上下应对，终于磨成９平。接着李英淑连失两球，李玲蔚以１２∶１１艰苦拿下第二局。
    换场之际，教练赶紧给李玲蔚指导战术，李英淑则独自坐着直喘气。决定胜负的第三局，李玲蔚发狠猛扣，以４∶０领先作底，脸上稍有笑容。不料稍有疏忽，又被追成４平。形势复归严峻。李玲蔚小心谨慎，但连扣两球不过网，几个球不敢下压，以８∶１０落后。李英淑眼看水到渠成。李玲蔚一记扣球碰到网顶正中，停顿一下掉到李英淑一边。李英淑可惜地朝队友耸耸鼻子，做个俏皮动作。李玲蔚终不敌李英淑，失去问鼎机会。
    赛后陈福寿教练表示，李英淑进步很快，南朝鲜队员已成为中国队的主要对手。至于李玲蔚输了这场球，并不表示走下坡路，我作为她的教练还是有信心的。
    李玲蔚刚卸下披甲，记者室里已准备好为她庆贺２５岁生日。国际羽联主席和数十名中外记者齐唱“生日快乐”。刚刚输了球的李玲蔚见此情景，大哭出声，以毛巾掩面，笑声泪影中，断断续续地说：“今天我非常激动，我会永远记住这一天。”
