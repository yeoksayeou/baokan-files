	Short songs hummed in alleys, music and dance on the streetsides:
	Tianjin Community Culture for All

	BEIJING, Jan. 24 (Xinhua) -- Mass culture by the masses, social culture by society -- this new community culture pattern in Tianjin City provides a source of daily entertainment for the people.

	While some professional performance venues are experiencing a decline in attendance, Tianjin City is bustling with self-entertaining "local" cultural activities in every nook and cranny. Among these, the community culture in Hexi District is particularly distinctive. In Qiandezhuang, every Sunday there is a lively "Beijing Opera Singing Festival," where enthusiasts gather to enjoy the music and singing, attracting a large audience. Singers belt out their tunes, while listeners tap their feet in appreciation. In Xiaohaidi, there is a street-level Kunlun Poetry Society organized by poetry lovers, filled with elegant charm. Zhujian Dao is known for magic shows, Pingju opera, and senior disco; Guojiatemple excels in flower arrangements; Taoyuan is famous for dance; Ti Yu Bei is known for martial arts and gateball; Yuexi Lu is famous for appreciating flowers and birds, with rare birds performing tricks like pecking stones and playing with eggs...

	These activities have been able to thrive due to the local "hidden talents" and the leadership of the district, which has guided and coordinated these efforts. The Hexi District Cultural Center has helped some enterprises form comedy troupes and choirs; the Women's Federation has organized family art competitions, with sisters, brothers, and grandparents performing together. Last year, 82% of the district's population participated in the district's cultural arts festival activities.

	Other districts and counties in Tianjin City are also breaking through the limitations of official and professional cultural management, actively developing community cultures with their own unique characteristics. For example, Heping District's street culture, Hedong District's family culture, Nankai District's folk culture, Hebei District's tourism culture, Hongqiao District's base culture, Wuqing County's rural culture, and Ji County's tourism culture...

	These homegrown, unique community cultures are flourishing, each showcasing their strengths and preparing to bring joy to ordinary families during the upcoming Spring Festival cultural wave.

　　短歌微吟于里巷　舞乐琴鸣在道旁    
    天津社区文化雅俗共赏
    本报天津１月２４日电  记者肖荻报道：群众文化群众办，社会文化社会办——天津市这一社区文化新格局，为群众日常的自我娱乐提供了源泉。
    在某些专业演出场所门庭冷落的同时，天津市角角落落却活跃着群众自娱式的“土特产”文化活动，其中以河西区的社区文化最具特色。在谦德庄，每周日有半天火爆的“京剧大家唱”，知音相聚，急管繁弦，吸引了大批同好，唱者引吭高歌，听者击节观赏。到小海地，则有诗歌爱好者组织的街道昆仑诗社，雅趣盎然。珠江道是魔术、评剧、老年迪斯科；挂甲寺擅花会；桃园以舞蹈见长；体院北是拳剑、门球；越秀路则是观赏花鸟，珍禽为你表演叼石打蛋……
    这些活动所以能长盛不衰，得力于当地的“藏龙卧虎”，也由于区领导因势利导地倡导和协调。河西区文化馆帮助一些企业组成喜剧团、合唱队；妇联组织了家庭文艺比赛，姑嫂同台，兄妹对唱，祖孙合演。全区８２％的人口去年参加了区文化艺术节活动。
    天津市其它区、县也在突破官办文化和专办文化的局限，积极发展各具特色的社区文化，如和平区的街头文化、河东区的家庭文化、南开区的民俗文化、河北区的游览文化、红桥区的阵地文化、武清县的田野文化、蓟县的旅游文化……
    这些土生土长、别具一格的群众文化，正在各展所长，争奇斗艳，准备在春节的文艺热潮中，把欢乐送给寻常百姓家。
