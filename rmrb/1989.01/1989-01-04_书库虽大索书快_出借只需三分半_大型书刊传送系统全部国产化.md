	Despite Large Library, Books Are Quickly Retrieved; Borrowing Takes Only Three and a Half Minutes
	Entirely Domestic Production of Large-Scale Book and Periodical Transmission System

	BEIJING, Jan. 4 (Xinhua) -- The Beijing University of Aeronautics and Astronautics has successfully developed a large-scale automated book and periodical retrieval and transmission system using entirely domestic components. The system, installed at the China Science and Technology Information Center, has been in operation for over nine months and recently passed a technical appraisal by the Ministry of Aeronautics and Astronautics.

	The underground library of the China Science and Technology Information Center is a large, flat-style library covering an area of 16,000 square meters, making it the largest library in China. The automated transmission system connects the eight service counters on the first to fourth floors of the center with the entire underground library through 16 horizontal and 8 vertical transmission lines and 32 transfer stations. This system achieves automated book transmission. It takes only half a minute to transmit a book request slip from the service counter to the designated location in the library, and only three minutes to transmit the borrowed book from the library to the service counter. The maximum transmission capacity per trip is 40 kilograms. The system's design is ingenious, with unique features in horizontal suspended transportation, automatic transfer between horizontal and vertical transportation, and automated transmission of book request slips.

	This is currently the largest and most automated book transmission device developed independently in China. The system significantly reduces the physical labor of library staff and shortens the waiting time for readers to borrow books. The equipment operates stably with no noise, is easy to use and maintain, and is cost-effective. Just the book request slip transmission system alone would cost $300,000 if imported from abroad.

　　书库虽大索书快　出借只需三分半
    大型书刊传送系统全部国产化
    本报讯  北京航空航天大学全部采用国产元件研制的大型书刊及索书条自动传送系统，在中国科技情报中心建成。经过９个多月的使用运行，最近通过航空航天部技术鉴定。
    中国科技情报中心地下书库为平铺式大面积书库，总面积为１．６万平方米，是国内目前最大的书库。这条自动传送系统通过１６条水平传送线、８条垂直传送线和３２个交接站，将科技情报中心大楼一至四层的８个出纳台和整个地下书库有机地联系起来，实现了图书传送自动化。从出纳台将借书条自动传送到书库各站指定位置，只需半分钟；从书库各站再把所借图书传送到出纳台，只需３分钟；一次最大运输量可达４０公斤。系统设计构思巧妙，在水平悬挂式运输、水平与垂直运输自动交接，以及借书条的自动传送等方面，均有独创。
    这是目前我国自行研制的规模最大、自动化程度最高的一条图书传送装置。该系统大大地减轻了图书工作人员的体力劳动，缩短了读者借书的等候时间。设备运行平稳，无噪音，使用简单，便于维修，造价便宜，仅借书条传送系统一项，若从国外引进就需３０万美元。
