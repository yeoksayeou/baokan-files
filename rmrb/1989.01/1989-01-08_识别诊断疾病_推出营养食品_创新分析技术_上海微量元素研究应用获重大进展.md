Shanghai has made significant progress in trace element research. The newly established Shanghai Trace Element Society recently reported that Shanghai has achieved several major breakthroughs in this field:

	— Progress in using new technologies to understand diseases. Researchers at Shanghai Medical University have made significant strides in analyzing several elements in the serum of patients with atypical hyperplasia of the stomach and healthy individuals. By applying the multi-element pattern recognition method, they have been able to distinguish between stomach cancer patients and healthy individuals with 100% accuracy, providing a new reference index for the diagnosis of stomach cancer. The Shanghai Institute of Atomic Nuclei has developed human reference standard materials and databases for trace elements in the human body and food, offering new tools for studying the relationship between trace elements and diseases.

	— Trace element preparations have reached new heights. In recent years, new foods and other nutritional products containing trace elements have been introduced to the market. The Shanghai Squibb Pharmaceutical Company, a joint venture between China and the United States, produces "Anke" and "Shike," which contain multiple vitamins and trace elements. These products have shown significant benefits for the growth and development of pregnant women and fetuses, as well as for the health and disease treatment of the elderly. Products like "Healthy Spleen Flower Pollen," which contains trace elements and is used to treat children with spleen deficiency, have also shown clear benefits in improving children's appetite and promoting growth.

	— New breakthroughs in trace element analysis methods. In addition to improving and enhancing commonly used methods such as atomic absorption spectroscopy and inductively coupled plasma emission spectroscopy, Shanghai has also developed new analytical technologies. These include disturbance correlation spectroscopy and ion chromatography, which are now being applied in biological research.

    上海微量元素研究应用获重大进展
    新华社上海１月７日电  （记者张学全）记者从新近成立的上海市微量元素学会了解到：上海在微量元素研究方面取得一系列重大进展：
    ——用新技术认识疾病有了长足进展。上海医科大学科研人员在进行胃癌不典型增生和正常人血清中几种元素的分析中，应用多元素模式识别法区别胃癌患者与正常人，精确率达１００％，从而为胃癌诊断提供了一个新的参考指标。上海原子核研究所制备的人发标准参考物质和人体微量元素数据库、食品微量元素数据库，为探讨微量元素与疾病的关系提供新手段。
    ——微量元素制剂生产跃上新水平。含微量元素的新食品，及其他营养品近年陆续登上商店柜台。中美上海施贵宝制药有限公司生产的含多种维生素和微量元素的“安尔康”和“施尔康”，对孕妇和胎儿的生长发育，对中老年保健和疾病治疗产生显著作用。治疗小儿脾虚症的健脾宝花粉等一些含微量元素的产品，对增进小儿食欲，促进生长也有明显作用。
    ——微量元素分析方法学研究有新突破。目前上海除对使用较多的原子吸收分光光度法、等离子体发射光谱法作了改进提高外，还推出一些新的分析技术，如扰动留关联技术、离子色谱技术，开始用于生物学研究。
