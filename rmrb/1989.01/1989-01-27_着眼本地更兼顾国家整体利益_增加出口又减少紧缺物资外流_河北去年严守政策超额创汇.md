	The province of Hebei, in its foreign trade imports and exports, not only paid attention to completing the export earnings task of the province but also considered the needs of the national economy. In 1988, the province's exports of miscellaneous goods exceeded the $12 billion mark, reaching a historical high, while the export of domestic scarce resources was significantly reduced.

	Hebei Province started its foreign trade exports late, and the structure of its export goods is fragile. Agricultural and sideline products and primary products account for 70%, while final products are less than 30%. In 1988, to stabilize the domestic economy, the state significantly reduced the export of Hebei Province's bulk commodities such as corn and cotton, resulting in gaps in the plan and difficulties in completing the tasks. Some cadres and workers developed a pessimistic and fearful attitude.

	In this situation, the leaders of the Hebei Provincial Government and the Provincial Foreign Economic and Trade Commission correctly analyzed the objective and subjective conditions. They did not merely complain about the difficulties or only consider the interests of the local region or department. They did not simply focus on exporting goods that earned the most money. Instead, they linked export earnings with the overall situation of national construction, striving to ensure that goods that are scarce domestically and need to be imported are not exported. For goods that are crucial to the national economy and people's livelihood, they strictly followed the state's quota for exports. For goods that are needed both domestically and internationally but are not essential for life, they allocated a portion for export. For labor-intensive and technology-intensive products that are abundant in domestic resources and not urgently needed in the domestic market, they vigorously organized exports. In 1988, they significantly reduced the export volume of bulk commodities such as cotton and corn, which have large production capacities in the province and are self-sufficient. Cotton exports were reduced from 100,000 tons the previous year to 76,000 tons, and corn exports were reduced from 800,000 tons in 1986 to 250,000 tons. The reduction in exports of several bulk commodities resulted in nearly $100 million less in export earnings.

	After making necessary adjustments to the variety of foreign trade exports, the Hebei foreign trade department proposed that export earnings should not only not "slide" but should also continue to grow steadily. From this starting point, they established the idea of supporting production, promoting production, and serving the development of production. They leveraged their strengths and, in every possible way, organized the import of raw materials according to production needs. They provided services in terms of funds, technology, equipment, and information, helping enterprises adjust the structure of export goods. They vigorously increased the production of garments, cotton textiles, fur products, carpets, ceramics, toys, handicrafts, building materials, and mechanical and electrical products. They insisted on using brand-name products as the leader, organizing regionalized and group-based production; continuously developing new products, accelerating the commercialization of scientific research results; studying and solving problems related to upgrading, improving the level, and scaling up initial products, and deep processing to expand the export of final products. At the same time, they improved industrial and commercial cooperation, built export commodity production bases, developed and improved the export production system, supported 178 production enterprises and 67 foreign exchange-earning agricultural projects across the province, and stabilized and expanded the supply of export commodities. The Livestock Import and Export Company, through industrial and commercial cooperation, developed new products, organized the production of carpets, fur garments, and wool products. In 1988, the export value of livestock products increased from $40 million in previous years to $100 million. Last year, Hebei Province continuously opened up new areas, developed new products, and used general commodities to replace bulk commodities. Not only did they make up for the gaps left by the reduction of bulk exports such as cotton and corn, but they also increased export earnings by 11.6% compared to the previous year.

	According to the relevant regulations in the 1988 Hebei Provincial Foreign Trade Commission's contract plan to the provincial government, if the total export of miscellaneous goods exceeds $12 billion, the entire provincial foreign trade workforce will be rewarded with material incentives. However, the cadres and workers of Hebei Province's foreign trade system, considering the temporary economic difficulties of the state, decided to take on the burden for the state and postponed the several million yuan of year-end bonuses.

　　着眼本地更兼顾国家整体利益　增加出口又减少紧缺物资外流   
    河北去年严守政策超额创汇
    本报讯  河北省在外贸进出口中，既注意本省出口创汇任务的完成，又考虑到国家整体经济发展的需要。１９８８年，全省杂货出口突破１２亿美元大关，创历史最高水平，国内紧缺物资的出口却大幅度减少。
    河北省外贸出口起步较晚，出口商品结构脆弱，农副产品和初级产品占７０％，最终产品还不到３０％。１９８８年，为了稳定国内经济，国家大量削减河北省玉米、棉花等大宗出口商品，致使计划出现空缺，给完成任务带来困难。有的干部职工产生了悲观畏难情绪。
    在这种情况下，河北省政府和省对外经贸委领导同志正确分析主客观条件，既没有一味怨天尤人，也没有单纯从本地区、本部门的利益出发，不是什么出口赚钱多就经营什么，而是把出口创汇同国家建设的大局联系起来，努力做到对国内非常紧缺又需进口的商品，坚决不出口；对与国计民生关系重大的商品，严格按国家限额出口；内外销都需要、但不是生活必需的商品，挤出一部分出口；国内资源丰富、国内市场不急需的劳动密集型和技术密集型产品，大力组织出口。１９８８年，他们把本省生产能力大、自给有余的棉花、玉米等大宗出口商品的出口量大幅度削减，棉花由上年的出口１０万吨减少到７．６万吨，玉米由１９８６年的８０万吨减少到２５万吨，几项大宗商品减少出口创汇额近１亿美元。
    外贸出口的品种作必要调整之后，河北省外贸部门提出，出口创汇不但不能“滑坡”，还要继续稳定增长。从这个基点出发，他们树立支持生产、促进生产、为发展生产服务的观点，发挥自己的长处，千方百计按照生产需要组织原材料进口，从资金、技术、设备、信息等方面提供服务，帮助企业调整出口商品结构，大力增加服装、针棉织品、裘皮制品、地毯、陶瓷、玩具、工艺品、建材和机电产品的生产。他们坚持以名牌产品为龙头，组织区域化和群体化生产；不断研制开发新产品，加快科研成果的商品化；研究解决初级产品上档次、上水平、上规模、深加工问题，扩大最终产品出口。同时搞好工贸联合，建设出口商品生产基地，发展、完善出口生产体系，扶持全省１７８个生产企业和６７个创汇农业项目，稳定和扩大出口商品货源。省畜产进出口公司通过工贸联合，研制开发新产品，组织地毯、裘皮服装和绒毛类产品生产，１９８８年畜产品出口额由往年的４０００万美元上升到１亿美元。去年，河北省不断开拓新领域，开发新产品，以一般商品顶代大宗商品，不仅弥补了棉花、玉米等大宗出口商品削减后出现的空缺，而且使出口创汇额比上一年增长１１．６％。
    按照１９８８年河北省经贸委向省政府承包方案中的有关规定，年杂货出口总额超过１２亿美元，要对全省外贸职工予以物质奖励。可是，河北省外贸系统干部职工考虑到国家经济上的暂时困难，决定替国家担担子，缓要几百万元年终奖金。
