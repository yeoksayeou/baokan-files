Early winter, we came to the foot of the Taihang Mountains to the Hébì North Station, a medium-sized freight station adjacent to the Hébì Coal Mine, which produces 500 million tons of coal annually. Coal transportation accounts for 90% of the total volume.

Five years ago, the Chinese railway department exposed one of the most serious cases of fraud involving the illegal sale of freight car quotas and coal since liberation. The criminals used bribery, collusion, and forged freight car plans to embezzle over 10 million yuan. This major case occurred at the Hébì North Station.

Five years have passed. We are pleased to learn that after rectification and reorganization, Hébì North Station has become an advanced unit within the Zhengzhou Railway Bureau, consistently completing transportation tasks and other indicators with excellence each year. In the past five years, there have been no illegal incidents.

How did this transformation come about? Perhaps some answers can be found in the deeds of Wang Jìfù, the Party Secretary of this station and an outstanding Communist Party member of the national railway system.

First and foremost, he is strict with himself

In October 1983, just after the freight car fraud case was handled, Wang Jìfù was appointed Party Secretary of Hébì North Station. He took over a chaotic situation where the staff's thoughts were in disarray, and corrupt practices were rampant.

On his third day in office, Wang Jìfù convened a Party committee meeting, drawing lessons from the previous administration, and formulated the "Eight Articles of the Leadership Team," which were publicly posted for all station staff to monitor.

Solving the housing disputes was a major challenge for the new secretary: some people had illegally occupied housing, while some families in difficulty had not been allocated any. People were talking about it.

After taking office, Wang Jìfù declined the relatively spacious housing allocated to him and moved his family of six into a 30-square-meter old apartment, sleeping in bunk beds because there wasn't enough space. After more than a year, the station's housing management committee allocated him a new 54-square-meter apartment according to the regulations, but he declined again. Soon, the old Party Secretary of the station was transferred to another place, vacating a 70-square-meter apartment, which he was invited to move into, but Wang Jìfù still refused. He suggested that the apartment be divided into four smaller rooms to solve the housing difficulties of single staff members. To this day, Wang Jìfù still lives in the old apartment, and the living conditions of many station staff have surpassed his.

Breaking the "network of connections"

Coal and freight cars have now become the crazy pursuit of some "speculators," who believe this is a shortcut to wealth. When the news of Wang Jìfù taking the leadership position at Hébì North Station spread, relatives, comrades-in-arms, fellow villagers... one by one came knocking on his door.

Wang Jìfù received all visitors warmly, never neglecting them. But when it came to the main issue, he would sincerely explain that the station Party committee had decided that officials should not use their power for personal gain or arbitrarily allocate freight cars.

Once, a supply and marketing co-op director from a coal mine came to Wang Jìfù's home and, seeing the simple and old furniture, said, "Old Wang, let me get you some wood to make a decent set of furniture!" Wang Jìfù politely declined. His wife couldn't understand, so Wang Jìfù patiently explained to her, "Why would they not send the wood to someone else, but specifically sell it to me? Have you thought about that?"

The most difficult thing for Wang Jìfù was this: once, when the station was recruiting, a leader's child did not pass the exam and was not admitted. That leader came in person to request special treatment. Facing this senior leader who had recommended him for the leadership position, Wang Jìfù mustered the courage to explain his predicament. Surprisingly, the senior leader happily withdrew his request and did not blame him at all.

Some say that the most frightening thing in work is the invisible "network of connections," surrounding you from all sides, making it difficult for you to defend yourself. But Wang Jìfù broke the "network of connections" because he had a measure—the measure of the people's interests.

Not being an "Iron Brother" who attends every banquet

Hébì City has a catchy phrase: "Spend a feast, gain tens of thousands; can't offend the Iron Brother, still have to invite him to sit." Thus, invitation after invitation was sent to Hébì North Station.

Wang Jìfù thought, wasn't it from here that some people in the station were dragged down? This gap must be closed. He conducted in-depth investigations among the staff, talking to more than 40 people, basically understanding the situation, and discovering four serious cases of accepting banquets. Based on this, the station Party committee decided that station officials were strictly prohibited from attending banquets hosted by shippers; the four serious cases of accepting banquets required the individuals involved to make self-criticisms and economically compensate.

You don't go to the banquet, and someone brings the wine to you. One spring festival, a factory, grateful for the station's support, sent 720 cheap wine tickets, each bottle of wine only symbolically costing 4.4 yuan. "Should we drink this cheap wine?" Wang Jìfù asked the surrounding staff, and everyone said, "No." So he burned the tickets in public, and everyone applauded, saying, "Burned well!"

The officials of Hébì North Station not attending banquets hosted by shippers did not hinder friendly cooperation with various units. By the end of the year, at tea parties, they exchanged friendships and listened to opinions, and the relationships were very harmonious.

Dealing with issues without favoring anyone

Hébì North Station used to have a bad practice: theft of goods often occurred, and shippers frequently suffered significant losses, complaining bitterly.

One day, Wang Jìfù inspected the cargo yard and found that several baskets of oranges that had not yet been shipped were opened. He and other station leaders discussed and decided to thoroughly investigate this incident and deal with it seriously. The thieves were quickly found, totaling 14 people. Wang Jìfù announced: stealing one orange would be fined 30 yuan. These people were stunned. Seeing that the leaders' resolve was unshakable, they had no choice but to pay the fines in full.

It is not easy to ensure that everyone is equal before discipline. Once, Wang Jìfù's brother-in-law did not pick up the consigned goods on time, and according to the station's regulations, a fine was imposed. The brother-in-law asked him to intercede. Wang Jìfù said: if you are not fined, and he is not fined, then the discipline and system are just talk? With his persuasion, the brother-in-law paid the fine according to the regulations.

　　心中有把人民利益之尺
    ——记全国铁路优秀共产党员王计富
    季音　鹿金有
    初冬时节，我们来到太行山脚下的鹤壁北站，这是个中等规模的货运站，紧靠年产５００万吨煤的鹤壁煤矿，煤炭运输占总运量的９０％。
    五年前，我国铁路部门揭露出一起解放后最严重的倒卖车皮指标和煤炭的案件。罪犯采取贿赂拉拢、伪造车皮计划等手法，骗取暴利１００多万元。这起大案就发生在这个鹤壁北站。
    五年过去了。我们欣喜地得悉，鹤壁北站经过治理、整顿，已成为郑州铁路局的先进单位，每年都出色地完成运输任务和其它各项指标，五年里没有发生一起违法事件。
    这变化是怎么来的呢？从这个车站的党委书记、全国铁路优秀共产党员王计富的许多事迹中也许可以找出一些答案。
    　　　　首先是严于律己
    １９８３年１０月，倒卖车皮案件刚刚处理结束，王计富奉命调任鹤壁北站任党委书记。他接手的是一个职工思想混乱，歪风邪气盛行的摊子。
    上任第３天，王计富就召开党委会，吸取前任教训，制定了领导班子“约法八章”，张榜公布，让全站职工监督。
    解决住房纠纷是新书记面临的一大难题：有的人搞不正之风强占住房，而有些困难户分不到房子，人们议论纷纷。王计富到任后，谢绝分给他的较宽绰的住房，一家６口搬进一层楼的一套３０多平方米的旧房，住不下，就架起双层铺。过了一年多，车站房管会根据文件规定，分给他一套５４平米的新楼房，他又谢绝了。不久，车站的老党委书记调往外地，腾出一套７０多平米的房子，让他去住，王计富还是不肯搬，他建议把这套房子改造成四小间，解决单身职工住房困难。至今，王计富仍然住在原来的旧房里，车站不少职工的居住条件超过了他。
    　　　　打破“关系网”
    煤与车皮，如今成了一些“倒爷”们疯狂追逐的目标，他们认定这是发财的捷径。当王计富任鹤壁北站领导职务的消息传出后，一些亲戚、战友、老乡……一个个找上门来。
    凡是来到家里的亲友，王计富一律热情接待，决不怠慢。但一说到“正题”，他就诚恳说明，车站党委会有决定，干部不得以权谋私，乱给车皮。
    有一次，一个煤矿的供销处长来到王计富家里，看到室内家具简陋陈旧，便说：“老王，给你弄两方木材做套像样的家具吧！”王计富婉言谢绝。他爱人想不通，王计富耐心开导她：“人家为什么不把木材送到别人家，偏要卖给我呢？这你想过没有？”
    最使王计富为难的莫过于这件事：有一次车站招工，一位领导同志的孩子考试不及格没被录取，那位老同志亲自跑来要求照顾。面对这位曾推荐他走上领导岗位的老上级，王计富鼓起勇气说明了自己的苦衷。出乎意料，这位老同志愉快地收回了要求，一点儿也没有责备他。
    有人说，工作中最可怕的就是无形的“关系网”，从四面八方包围你，使你难以招架。但王计富打破了“关系网”，因为他有一把尺——人民利益之尺。
    　　　　不做有宴必到的“铁大哥”
    鹤壁市有段顺口溜：“舍得一席宴，获利好几万；惹不起铁大哥，还得请上座”。于是，一张张请柬送到了鹤壁北站。
    王计富想，过去站上有些人被拉下水，不就是从这里打开了缺口？这一关必须把住。他深入职工调查，先后找了４０多人谈话，基本摸清了情况，发现有四起情节比较严重的吃请。据此，站党委会作出决定，今后车站干部一律不准参加货主的宴请；那四次比较严重的吃请，当事人作出检讨，并要经济退赔。
    你不去赴宴，有人又把酒送上门来了。一年春节，一个工厂感谢车站对他们的支持，送来了７２０张便宜酒票，凭票每瓶酒只需象征性地付４角多钱。“这便宜酒我们喝不喝呀？”王计富问周围的职工，大伙说：“不喝”。于是他就当众把酒票烧了，大家拍手说：“烧得好”！
    鹤壁北站干部不参加货主宴请，并不妨碍与各单位的友好合作，到了年终岁末，在茶话会上互叙友情，倾听意见，关系十分融洽。
    　　　　处理问题对谁也不手软
    鹤壁北站过去还有股歪风，就是偷窃货物的事常有发生，货主经常遭受大量损失，叫苦不迭。
    一天，王计富到货场检查工作，发现那里有几筐还未启运的桔子被人扒开了。他与车站其他领导经过商量，决定彻底查清这件事，严肃处理。偷桔子的人很快查出来了，共１４人。王计富宣布：偷一个桔子罚３０元。这些人一听，个个目瞪口呆。看领导的决心不可动摇，只好一个个如数交出罚款。
    要做到在纪律面前人人平等并不容易。有一回，王计富的姐夫没有按时提取托运来的货物，按车站规定要罚款。姐夫求他说说情。王计富说：对你不罚，对他不罚，这纪律和制度不是吹了吗？在他劝说下，姐夫按规定如数付了罚款。
