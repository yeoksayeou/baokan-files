	The drought in the United States has continued to spread to the main winter wheat producing areas since the beginning of this year, seriously affecting the growth of winter wheat. Experts on grain issues are concerned that following last year's drought, the expansion of the drought this year will further reduce the grain reserves in the United States and the world, thereby causing grain prices to rise again.

	This year's winter drought has already spread to 31% of the country's regions, and it is mainly concentrated in the grain-producing areas.

	Experts point out that due to the drought, the world's grain production has been below the consumption level for two consecutive years, and the world's grain reserves have dropped to the lowest level since 1973.

	Experts also point out that the drought not only affects the winter wheat in the United States, but other major wheat-producing countries such as the Soviet Union, Australia, and Argentina are also facing droughts. Therefore, there will be a new upward trend in wheat prices. In the U.S. market, the average selling price of 1 bushel of wheat was $2.57 in 1987, but last week, the price had risen to $4.05.

　　美国旱情扩展  小麦价格看涨
    本报华盛顿１月２３日电  今年以来，美国旱情持续向冬小麦主要产区扩展，对冬小麦生长产生了严重影响。粮食问题专家们担心，继去年旱灾之后，今年旱情的蔓延将使美国和世界的粮食库存进一步减少，从而再度引起粮食价格上涨。
    今年隆冬季节的旱情已经扩展到全国３１％的地区，而且主要集中在产粮区。
    专家们指出，由于干旱，世界粮食产量连续两年低于用粮数量，世界粮食储备跌到１９７３年以来最低水平。
    专家们还指出，旱情不仅影响美国的冬小麦，其他主要产麦国如苏联、澳大利亚、阿根廷也遇到干旱。因此小麦价格将出现新的涨风。在美国市场，１９８７年１蒲式耳小麦的平均售价为２．５７美元，而上周，售价已升到４．０５美元。
