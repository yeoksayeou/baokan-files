“Solidification Turned into Fluidity”
– A Record of Shanxi County Liquor Factory's Deepening Reforms
By Duan Xinqiang, People's Daily Reporter

Iron rice bowl, iron chair, iron wage – the drawbacks of the “three irons” lie in their rigidity. Solidified, they cannot move, and thus cannot be vibrant. Shandong Shanxi County Liquor Factory deepened its reforms by optimizing the “three irons” to make the solidified fluid. This truly revitalized the enterprise. Last year’s tax and profit contract target of 1.85 million yuan was actually completed at 2.70 million yuan.

	“Flow Domain” One: Cadres – Workers
You are a worker, sorry, no matter how talented you are, you cannot be promoted; he is a cadre, by regulation, no matter how incompetent he is, he cannot be demoted, otherwise, he will cause trouble – the party branch secretary of Shanxi County Liquor Factory, Sun Jishan, was always troubled by this “tightening spell.” The hand of reform removed his “tightening spell,” and he and other leaders discussed: optimize the combination, smash the “iron chair,” and let cadres and workers flow between each other: workers with ability, even if they are temporary workers, can become cadres; cadres who fall short can become workers. Moreover, frequently combine and continuously flow.

The operations department head, Huang Deqing, had limited ability but was kind-hearted. With over 20 years of cadre experience, he became a mid-level leader in the factory. He was content, always cheerful, doing more for others, opening more paths, but not putting enough effort into work. Once, because bottles were not prepared, it affected the factory's income by several ten thousand yuan. When the factory director formed the team, he asked Huang to step down and go to the inventory department as a worker. This turned his sense of security into a sense of urgency. The slow pace he had formed over decades suddenly sped up, and now he is busy both inside and outside the warehouse, keeping the accounts in order, and placing items neatly. In his words: to compete for the next term's department head or factory director.

Temporary worker Ding Shuyin, with a sharp tongue and skilled hands, had technology and management skills, and everyone respected him! However, the old head of the alcohol workshop, though qualified, did not know how to manage and was afraid to offend people, with an alcohol output rate of only 36%. When the factory director combined the workshop leadership team, he let Ding Shuyin take his place. Director Ding showed his skills, recombining the workshop, contracting to the team and individuals, making everyone use their strengths, breaking the routine of “hot pressing oil, cold brewing alcohol,” and in the hottest days of summer, increasing the alcohol output rate to 43%. One shift per month produced an additional ton of good alcohol, saving grain and also reducing costs, making everyone satisfied!

	“Flow Domain” Two: Employment – Unemployment
Workers have a traditional mindset: once they enter the factory and eat commercial grain, it’s like planting iron-stemmed sorghum, drought-resistant and flood-resistant, equivalent to joining an “insurance company.” Therefore, some people do not ensure quality or quantity in their work. As long as there are no major mistakes, no one can do anything about it. Shanxi County Liquor Factory, in its optimization combination, stipulated: regardless of who it is, if they are assigned, they work; if they are not assigned and cannot find a place themselves, they are unemployed. Moreover, unemployed people should be maintained at a certain percentage.

Sixth-grade white liquor worker Wei Qiuyong, a demobilized soldier and also a party member, treated his qualifications as capital, talking big but not working, and also influencing others. The workshop director combined the team and asked him to find his own job. No one in the factory wanted him, and he became unemployed. With no work, he only received living expenses, and when there was work, he was a “patch,” doing odd jobs and receiving piecework wages. He thought this was deliberately making workers lose face, and he complained everywhere. But the leaders openly and honestly said: “You are right! Letting a part of the workers be unemployed is to make those relatively unqualified workers feel pressure, gain motivation, and compete to work hard.” Seeing that there was no “trick” left, he obediently became a “patch,” pulling materials, doing odd jobs, and doing whatever he was told. Everyone said: “Old Wei has changed!”

The unemployed team is also not ironclad. Some people changed their work attitude or improved their skills and flowed back to the production positions, replacing those relatively backward workers. Old white liquor worker Yang Shuqing had skills but did not use them, very slick, and after being unemployed, his thoughts were greatly stirred. On one hand, he deeply examined himself, and on the other hand, he humbly became a “patch,” seriously operating the boiler, determined to make amends. The workshop director took him to be a team leader, and he operated seriously, demanded strictly, and produced famous liquors such as “Old Liquor” and “Half-Moon Platform.”

	“Flow Domain” Three: High Wage – Low Wage
In the past, cadres and workers would have their wages increased at the end of the year, wanting more or less was not possible, ironclad! Because working more or less resulted in the same pay, most people did not strive for excellence. Shanxi County Liquor Factory, on the basis of optimization combination, implemented fixed-personnel contracting, receiving wages according to the position, earning according to the work done, and each person’s daily income flowed between high and low wages.

Xue Junmin was originally a fourth-grade worker, with a basic monthly wage of over 80 yuan. Due to his outstanding performance, he was combined into a workshop director, immediately receiving the workshop director’s wage, over 120 yuan per month. After working for a period, there was a better candidate for the director, and he went down to be a worker. According to the contract, his monthly wage was not fixed, averaging over 90 yuan. Doing one kind of work had one kind of income, fair and reasonable, so everyone hurried to learn, worked hard, and tried to obtain an important position.

After fixed-personnel contracting, whether you increase or decrease personnel does not matter, as long as you complete the production task according to the requirements, you will be paid according to the contract. Song Fuheng’s team of 9 people had a period when two workers could not come to work due to family matters. They did not increase personnel, and 7 people did 9 people’s work. The quality and quantity of the alcohol did not decrease, so the workshop paid according to 9 people, and each person earned over 50 yuan more per month. Another team privately increased two people, and the workshop did not pay more wages, with each person earning over 40 yuan less per month. Each workshop, each team, and each person had different incomes each month, floating between high and low wages, stimulating the enthusiasm of all cadres and workers, and increasing labor productivity by over 30%.

　　“凝固”变为“流动”
    ——山东单县酒厂深化改革纪实
    本报记者  段心强
    铁饭碗、铁交椅、铁工资——“三铁”的弊端在于“铁”。凝固的，动不了，也活不了。山东单县酒厂深化改革，用优化组合化“三铁”，使凝固的变成流动的。真灵，一下子把企业搞活了，去年１８５万元利税承包指标，实际完成２７０万元。
    　　　　“流域”之一：干部——工人
    你是工人，对不起，再有本事也不能提干；他是干部，有规定，再没能耐也不能叫他去当工人，要不跟你闹个没完——单县酒厂党总支书记孙继善一直被这个“紧箍咒”勒得头痛。改革的巨手给他摘去“紧箍咒”，他和其他领导人一合计：搞优化组合，砸烂“铁交椅”，让干部与工人间相互流动：工人有能力，哪怕是临时工，也可当干部；干部相形见绌，就去当工人。而且经常组合，不断流动。
    经营科长黄德清，能力不算大，为人倒厚道。２０多年的干龄加在一起就是资本，当上厂里中层领导干部。他很知足，整天乐哈哈地多为人，多开路，在工作上花的功夫不够。有一次，因为瓶子没备好，影响厂里收入几万元。厂长组阁时，请他让出了位置，到库存科当工人。这一下，安全感变成了危急感，几十年形成的慢节奏突然加快了，他现在忙了库里忙库外，帐目搞得井井有条，东西放得整齐有序。用他的话说：要竞争下一届的科长、厂长。
    临时工丁书印，嘴一份子，手一份子，有技术，会管理，大伙服！可他们酒精车间老主任虽有资格，但不会管理，又怕得罪人，出酒率只有３６％。厂长组合车间领导班子时，让丁书印取而代之。丁主任大显身手，在车间里重新组合，包到班组、个人，使大伙有风的使风，有雨的使雨，打破了“热轧油，冷出酒”的常规，在三伏天，把出酒率提高到４３％。一个班一个月就多出一吨好酒，节省粮食，也降低了成本，都满意！
    　　　　“流域”之二：就业——待业
    工人有个传统心理：进了厂，吃上商品粮，就像种上铁杆高梁，旱涝保收，等于入了“保险公司”。因此，一些人干活不保质，也不保量。只要没大错，谁也不能把谁怎么样。单县酒厂在优化组合中规定：不管是谁，组合上，干；组合不上，自己又找不到地方，就待业。而且，要让待业者保持在百分之几。
    六级白酒工魏秋勇，转业军人，还是个党员。他把资格当资本，光耍嘴皮子不干活，而且还影响别人干。车间主任搞组合，请他自找职业。全厂没人要，他待了业。没活干只发生活费，有工作也是当“补丁”，干杂活，领计件工资。他认为这是故意叫工人丢人现眼，四处告状。可领导当面锣，对面鼓，明打明敲：“你说得对！让一部分工人待业，就是叫那些相比之下不合格的工人有压力，变动力，比着干。”他看没“招”了，便老老实实当“补丁”，拉料、打杂，叫干啥干啥。都说：“老魏变了！”
    待业队伍也不是铁的，有些人改变了劳动态度，或者提高了技术，便流向生产岗位，顶下那些相对落后的工人。老白酒工杨树清，有本事不使，油得很，待业后思想触动很大，一方面深刻检查，同时甘当“补丁”，烧锅炉也很认真，决心立功补过。车间主任把他要去当班长，他认真操作，要求严格，生产出“陈酒”、“半月台”等名酒。
    　　　　“流域”之三：高薪——低薪
    过去，干部、工人到年头涨工资，想多也多不了，想少也少不了，铁的！因为干多干少一样钱，大都不好强争胜。单县酒厂在优化组合的基础上搞定员承包，在什么岗位领什么工资，干多少活拿多少钱，每个人每天的收入都在高薪与低薪间流动。
    薛军民原是四级工，每月的基本工资８０多元。由于干得出色，被组合成车间主任，马上领车间主任的工资，每月１２０元上下。干一段时间后，又有了更好的主任人选，他下去当工人，根据承包合同，他每月工资不等，平均９０多元。干一种工作有一种收入，公平合理，因此都加紧学习，使劲工作，尽量争得个重要的岗位。
    定员承包后，你增人、减人都不管，只要按要求完成生产任务，就按合同给钱。宋福彦带的班９个人，有段时间因两个工人家里有事不能上班，他们没有加人，７个人干９个人的活，酒的质量和产量都不差，车间便按９个人发钱，每个人每月多得５０多元。另一个班私自增加两个人，车间也不多发工资，每人每月收入减少４０多元。每个车间、每个班组、每个人，每个月的收入都不一样，都在高薪和低薪之间浮动，调动了全体干部和工人的积极性，劳动生产率提高３０％多。
