		Daring to Rule in Remote and Dangerous Places
		The Chinese Scientific Exploration Association Established

		Beijing, January 21 (Reported by Chen Zujia for this newspaper): As scientists are advancing towards the East Antarctic, facing enormous ice avalanches and numerous hardships, the Chinese Scientific Exploration Association was officially established today.

		In this era of rapid scientific and technological development, human exploration of natural resources and the environment involves an increasingly wide range of disciplines and areas. Scientific exploration activities, which encompass social sciences, natural sciences, and humanities, have penetrated into oceans, rivers, lakes, mountains, caves, glaciers, deserts, forests, marshes, polar regions, and extreme cold and heat zones.

		Since the founding of the nation, Chinese scientists and athletes have conducted exploratory scientific investigations in Mount Qomolangma, Xixabangma Peak, Tuomuer Peak, Ngangkar Tse, the uninhabited regions of northern Tibet, the Dulong River, the Lop Nur, and the Karakoram Mountains. These scientific exploration activities have brought positive value to the development of China's science and technology and economic construction, contributing to human cultural development and social progress.

		Today, Liu Dongsheng, Chairman of the Chinese Scientific Exploration Association and member of the Chinese Academy of Sciences, said that as a civilian organization, the Chinese Scientific Exploration Association will actively engage in international cooperation, and organize and plan scientific exploration activities to promote the rational development and ecological environmental protection of China's natural resources.

　　敢在幽绝险远之处称雄
    中国科学探险协会成立
    本报北京１月２１日讯  记者陈祖甲报道：正当科技工作者进军东南极、经历巨大冰崩和多次磨难的时候，中国科学探险协会今天在这里宣布成立。
    在科学技术高速发展的今天，人类对自然资源和环境的探索，涉及的学科和范围越来越广泛。包涵了社会科学、自然科学和人文科学的科学探险活动，已经渗入海洋、江河、湖泊、高山、洞穴、冰川、沙漠、丛林、沼泽、南北极地和寒热极点等地域。
    建国以后，我国科学和体育工作者曾对珠穆朗玛峰、希夏邦马峰、托木尔峰、南迦巴瓦峰、藏北无人区、独龙江、罗布泊、喀喇昆仑山进行了带有探险性质的科学考察。这些科学探险活动给我国科学技术、经济建设发展带来了积极的价值，对人类文化发展和社会进步作出了贡献。
    中国科学探险协会主席、中国科学院学部委员刘东生今天说，中国科学探险协会作为一个民间的机构，将积极开展国际合作，有计划、有组织地开展科学探险活动，以推动我国自然资源合理开发和生态环境保护的考察研究。
