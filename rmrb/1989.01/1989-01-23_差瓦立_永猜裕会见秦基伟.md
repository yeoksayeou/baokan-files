Xinhua News Agency, Bangkok, January 21 (Reporter Huang Yong) – Chinese Defense Minister General Qin Jiwei and his delegation, who are visiting here, met with Thailand's Acting Supreme Commander of the Armed Forces and Army Commander General Chavalit Yongchaiyudh at the Thai Armed Forces Headquarters this morning.

During the meeting, both sides expressed satisfaction with the roles their respective militaries play in national construction and agreed to further cooperation to promote national economic development. Both sides believe that resolving the Cambodian issue has become an "inevitable trend."
