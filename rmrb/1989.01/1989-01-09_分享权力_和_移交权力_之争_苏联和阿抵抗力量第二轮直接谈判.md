The second round of direct talks between the Soviet Union and Afghan resistance forces, held on January 6 at the Pakistani Ministry of Foreign Affairs, did not achieve a breakthrough but also did not lead to a complete breakdown. The Soviet side stated that it would withdraw all troops by February 15 in accordance with the Geneva Accords. Both sides agreed to continue negotiations at an appropriate time and place.

Both sides prepared thoroughly for this round of direct talks. Following the first meeting held in Saudi Arabia in early December last year, Soviet First Deputy Foreign Minister and Ambassador to Kabul, Vorontsov, traveled to Rome to meet with the former Afghan King Zahir Shah, hoping that this exiled former head of state could play a positive role in resolving the Afghan issue. Subsequently, Vorontsov flew to Tehran to hold talks with the Iranian government and the eight-party alliance of Afghan resistance forces based in Iran. The Soviet Union adjusted its stance on a political solution to the Afghan issue. On the matter of forming the future Afghan government, the Soviet side no longer insisted on establishing a government dominated by the People's Democratic Party, agreeing that the party could participate as a minority and announcing that if a genuine ceasefire is achieved within Afghanistan, the Soviet Union would no longer provide military aid to Afghanistan. Upon arriving in Islamabad on January 4, Vorontsov stated that he would discuss with the Afghan resistance forces issues such as "establishing a broad-based coalition government in Afghanistan, a fundamentally new Afghan government." However, the Soviet side's basic position is to insist that the People's Democratic Party "share power" in the future government.

The Afghan resistance forces also prepared for the second round of talks. The former chairman of the seven-party alliance based in Peshawar, Rabbani, led a six-person delegation to Iran to coordinate policies and unify positions with the eight-party alliance there, in order to jointly deal with the Soviet Union at the negotiating table. He also invited representatives from the eight-party alliance to participate in the second round of talks held in Islamabad. After the New Year, the seven-party alliance sent 20 representatives from each party to Peshawar for a meeting to discuss the strategy and tactics of the negotiations. Meanwhile, the representatives of the eight-party alliance arrived in Pakistan, and the two major resistance alliances jointly drafted five basic conditions to present to the Soviet Union during this round of talks: unconditional complete withdrawal of Soviet troops; respect for the self-determination of the Afghan people; the Soviet Union should no longer insist on the People's Democratic Party participating in the future government; the Soviet Union should not hold separate talks with any Afghan parties or individuals; the Soviet Union should genuinely intend to resolve the Afghan issue through negotiations. Two representatives from the eight-party alliance participated in this round of direct talks, and the two alliances sat together to negotiate with the Soviet Union, which was the first time. It can be seen that the position of the resistance forces has also undergone significant adjustments: no longer emphasizing the resolution of the Afghan issue through war, gradually agreeing to achieve this goal through political means and negotiations. The seven-party alliance abandoned the idea of establishing a "jihadist government" dominated by the alliance and shifted to forming a broad-based government through the establishment of a consultative parliament, composed of representatives from all sides. This government excludes the People's Democratic Party but can absorb "good Muslim" individuals from the current Kabul regime. Their specific plan is to establish a consultative parliament with 480 members, with 60 members each from the seven-party alliance and the eight-party alliance. The remaining seats are reserved for guerrilla commanders fighting within the country, prominent figures in exile, tribal leaders, and refugee representatives, with a certain proportion of seats reserved for "good Muslims." The basic position of the resistance forces is to demand that the Soviet Union and Najibullah peacefully "transfer power."

The second round of talks between the Soviet Union and the Afghan resistance forces lasted for five hours but ultimately made no progress due to the dispute over "sharing power" and "transferring power." However, both sides agreed to continue negotiations. Additionally, there were two actions that gave hope. There were reports that during the talks, the resistance forces handed over two lists to the Soviet side: one of acceptable individuals from the current Kabul regime and another of unacceptable individuals. This provides a basis for the next round of talks. It was also reported that the Soviet Union has invited the leaders of the resistance forces to visit Moscow. It is said that the leaders of the resistance forces expressed that if the Soviet side agrees to let them speak on television to the Soviet people and visit the Muslim regions of Central Asia, they would consider the visit. Various signs indicate that the possibility of continued talks between the Soviet Union and the Afghan resistance forces exists, although there are still many difficulties and twists and turns. However, the peaceful resolution of the Afghan issue seems achievable.

### “分享权力”和“移交权力”之争——苏联和阿抵抗力量第二轮直接谈判

　　“分享权力”和“移交权力”之争
    ——苏联和阿抵抗力量第二轮直接谈判
    本报记者  任毓骏
    元月６日在巴基斯坦外交部大楼举行的苏联和阿富汗抵抗力量第二轮直接谈判没有取得突破，但也没有彻底决裂。苏方表示将遵照日内瓦协议于２月１５日全部撤军，双方都同意在适当的时间和地点继续谈判。
    双方为举行这次直接谈判都作了认真准备。继去年１２月初在沙特举行第一次会谈后，苏联第一副外长、驻喀布尔大使沃龙佐夫去罗马会见了阿富汗前国王查希尔，希望这位流亡在外的前国家元首能在解决阿富汗问题中起积极作用。此后，沃龙佐夫又飞赴德黑兰，同伊朗政府以及以伊朗为基地的阿富汗抵抗力量八党联盟举行谈判。苏联对政治解决阿富汗问题的立场作了一定的调整。在组建阿富汗未来政府问题上，苏方已不再坚持建立以人民民主党为主体的政府，同意该党作为少数派参加政府，并宣布如阿富汗境内真正实现停火，苏联即不再向阿提供军事援助。沃龙佐夫于元月４日抵伊斯兰堡后表示，将与阿富汗抵抗力量讨论“在阿富汗建立一个基础广泛的联合政府，一个基本上是新的阿富汗政府”等问题。但苏联方面的基本立场是坚持让人民民主党在未来政府中“分享权力”。
    阿富汗抵抗力量也为举行第二轮谈判进行了准备。以白沙瓦为基地的阿富汗七党联盟前任主席拉巴尼率领一个６人代表团赴伊朗，和那里的抵抗力量八党联盟协调政策，统一立场，以便在谈判桌上共同对付苏联。他还邀请八党联盟派代表参加在伊斯兰堡举行的第二轮谈判。新年过后，七党联盟每党派出２０名代表在白沙瓦开会，共同讨论谈判的战略和策略。与此同时，八党联盟代表团来到巴基斯坦，两大抵抗联盟共同拟定了这次谈判中向苏联提出的五项基本条件：苏联无条件全部撤军；苏联尊重阿富汗人民的自决权；苏联不再坚持人民民主党参加未来政府；苏联不与阿富汗有关党派或个人单独举行会谈；苏联应确有诚意通过谈判解决阿富汗问题。两名八党联盟代表参加了这次直接谈判，两大联盟坐在一起和苏联举行谈判，这是第一次。人们看到，抵抗力量的立场也作了较大调整：不再强调以战争解决阿富汗问题，逐步同意以政治手段和谈判达到这一目的。七党联盟放弃了建立以联盟为主体的“圣战者政府”，转变为通过成立一个协商性的议会，组建一个有各方人士参加的基础广泛的政府。这个政府排除人民民主党，但可以吸收喀布尔现政权中“表现好的穆斯林”人士参加。他们的具体方案是成立一个４８０名成员的协商性议会，七党联盟和八党联盟各出６０人，其余席位留给在国内作战的游击队司令、流亡国外的知名人士、各部落首领和难民代表，还有一定比例的席位留给“表现好的穆斯林”。抵抗力量的基本立场是要求苏联和纳吉布拉和平“移交权力”。
    苏联和阿富汗抵抗力量举行的第二轮谈判虽然进行了５个小时，但终因“分享权力”和“移交权力”之争而没有取得进展。但双方都同意继续谈判。此外，还有两个举动也给人以希望。有消息说，在谈判中抵抗力量代表交给苏方两份名单，一个是现喀布尔政权中他们可以接受的人选，另一个是他们不能接受的人选。这就为下一次谈判提供了基础。另据报道，苏联已邀请抵抗力量领导人去莫斯科访问。据说抵抗力量领导人表示，如苏方同意让他们在电视台向苏联人民发表讲话和访问苏联中亚地区的穆斯林，他们则考虑成行。种种迹象表明，苏联同阿富汗抵抗力量继续会谈的可能性是存在的，尽管困难和曲折依然不少，但和平解决阿富汗问题看来是能够实现的。
