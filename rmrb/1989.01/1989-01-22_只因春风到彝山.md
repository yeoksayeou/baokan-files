In some Yi villages in the Yunnan Chu Xiong Yi Autonomous Prefecture, you can still see low wooden houses built with round logs. These were once the traditional homes of the Yi people. In Nan Hua County's Chahe New Village, Deputy County Magistrate Wang Shulong pointed to the low doorway of the wooden house and said, "This records a humiliating chapter in the history of the Yi people." He said, "After the Yi people's uprising was suppressed in the Ming Dynasty, the Ming rulers stipulated that the doorways of Yi homes could not exceed three and a half chi, meaning that the Yi people must always bow their heads." This humiliating symbol has become an emblem of the Yi people's poverty and backwardness. Today, next to the wooden houses that have been turned into livestock pens, new houses stand tall; two-story buildings, stone foundations, rammed earth walls, wooden frames, tiled roofs, and especially doorways five chi high, allowing people to walk in and out with their heads held high, letting in the winds from the south and north and the sunlight from the east and west, brightly displaying the changes of history.

The village head is a dark-skinned Yi man who cheerfully told me that in Chahe New Village, this 100% Yi village, 65 households have built 65 new houses. In this agricultural village where each person has only eight mu of land, they have begun to prosper a little by relying on the timber, firewood, and matsutake mushrooms from the mountains. The village head said that when the main beam of the new house was placed on the top of the column, people pasted red paper with eight trigrams, prayed to the heavens for blessings, set off firecrackers, expressed their joy, and indicated their farewell to a poor era. Although this method of relying on heavenly blessings to become rich has not completely shed the traces of a natural economy that depends on heaven for sustenance and cannot truly stimulate the development of a commodity economy, the Yi people here no longer have the humiliation of poverty and the poverty of humiliation.

Dry Sea Resources, at this historical turning point, has gone further and faster than Chahe New Village.

Dry Sea Resources is an administrative village in Pinglang Town, Lu Feng County. As the village party branch secretary, Pu Guangmei, put it, "The mountains have trees, the fields have grain, and the ground has coal," and it is also close to the railway line, making it a place with good feng shui. However, four years ago, this "auspicious place" was a well-known impoverished village in the county, truly lacking water and grain, with only four months of grain a year. Food relied on returns, clothing relied on relief, girls married out, sons ran away, and there was no money to find a wife.

In 1984, after Pu Guangmei went to Daqiuzhuang in Tianjin to learn and seek advice, he finally seized the opportunity given by history, with the ambition of a modern entrepreneur, dismantled the small peasant economy structure that had continued for thousands of years, and turned the entire village into a modern enterprise—the Dry Sea Resources Agricultural, Industrial, and Commercial Combined Company. It became a combined entity for agriculture, industry, mining, and commerce, consisting of 13 agricultural cooperatives, 8 coal mining teams, 1 construction team, and a lime factory, brick and tile factory, automobile factory, ferroalloy factory, smelting factory, forestry management office, reservoir management office, and ethnic middle school.

This is the product of courage, foresight, and policy. Dry Sea Resources has undergone changes much deeper than just building houses. The leader of this economic combined entity, Yi farmer entrepreneur Pu Guangmei, used a logic usually only economists have to tell us about the great changes in Dry Sea Resources: First, implement the household contract responsibility system to promote agricultural development. Now the village can complete 170,000 to 180,000 jin of commercial grain per year. Second, use the accumulated funds from industry to invest in water conservancy and scientific farming. There is water, plastic film, pesticides, and chemical fertilizers, and the grain yield per mu has increased from 200 to 300 jin to 1,300 jin. Third, transform agricultural surplus labor into non-agricultural labor, promoting the development of township enterprises mainly based on coal. Now, 630 people in the village are engaged in industrial production, accounting for more than 60% of the village's labor force. The development and strengthening of industry have accumulated funds to promote agricultural development, and labor is no longer flowing out, and girls are no longer marrying out. Fourth, the entire village has implemented free medical care and free education, from kindergarten to high school graduation, without tuition or book fees. Now, the enrollment rate of school-age children in the village has reached 100%, and the retention rate has reached 90%, with female students accounting for 46%. From 1984 to now, the village has invested 800,000 yuan in education, and the school has moved from a broken temple to a new building on the mountain, with all teaching equipment and facilities newly purchased. Fifth, introduce people, funds, and materials, and develop horizontal connections. In recent years, 6 engineers have been introduced from Kunming to help with smelting, and 1.4 million yuan in funds have been introduced to jointly establish factories and power plants. Sixth, strengthen intellectual investment. In addition to investing in general education, 180,000 yuan has been allocated to train more than 140 technical personnel of various types. Seventh, invest 250,000 yuan annually to protect forests and promote ecological balance. Now, the forest coverage rate in the village has increased from the original 40% to 80%, with 23,000 cubic meters of mature timber. Eighth, at the same time, focus on building spiritual civilization. In recent years, the village party branch has recruited 36 party members, and all 84 party members in the village are pioneers in reform, opening up, and revitalizing Dry Sea Resources.

Pu Guangmei summarized the experience of Dry Sea Resources in four sentences: "Support the family with agriculture, make a fortune with industry, protect the family with talent, and let policy be the master." This reminds me of the village head of Chahe's philosophy of getting rich: "Rely on the mountains to eat the mountains." The difference in their ideas is quite obvious. The Yi people, standing at the historical turning point, are choosing their own future.

### 只因春风到彝山

　　只因春风到彝山
    本报记者  邹大毅
    在云南楚雄彝族自治州的一些彝族村寨中，还可以看到用一根根圆木垒成的矮小的垛木房。这曾经是彝族的传统住房。在南华县的岔河新村，副县长王树龙指着垛木房低矮的房门说：“这上面记载了彝族一段屈辱的历史。”他说：“明朝彝民起义被镇压后，明朝统治者规定彝族的房门不得超过三尺五，意思是要彝族的人民永远低下头。”这屈辱的标志，已成为彝族人民贫困落后的象征。今天，就在那已作畜圈的垛木房旁边，矗立起了幢幢新房；二层楼，石基，夯土墙，木构架，青瓦顶，特别是五尺高的大门，走进走出挺直了腰板，纳进了南来北往的风、东起西落的阳光，亮堂堂地展示着历史的巨变。
    村长是个黑脸膛的彝族汉子，乐呵呵地告诉我，在岔河新村这个１００％的彝族村寨里，６５户人家盖了６５幢新房。一个人均只有八分田地的农业村，靠着山上的木材、薪炭林和松茸开始小富起来。村长说，当新房子的大梁往柱顶上架时，人们贴上红纸八卦符，祈求上苍保佑，燃放鞭炮，抒发欢乐的心情，表示和一个贫穷的时代告别。尽管这种依赖天赐财源致富的方式还没有完全摆脱靠天吃饭的自然经济的痕迹，还不能真正刺激商品经济的发展，但这里的彝族已没有了在屈辱中的贫困和在贫困中的屈辱。
    干海资，在这个历史转变的关头，比起岔河新村来，走得更远，更快。
    干海资是禄丰县平浪镇的一个行政村。用这个村党支部书记普光美的话来说，这里“山上有树，田头有粮，地下有煤”，还靠着铁路线，是个风水宝地。可是，四年前，这“宝地”却是全县有名的特困村，真个是“缺水又缺粮，一年只有四月粮。吃的靠返销，穿的救济衣。姑娘往外嫁，儿子往外跑，手中无钱讨婆娘。”
    １９８４年，普光美到天津大邱庄讨教取经之后，他终于抓住了历史给予的机会，用一个现代企业家的抱负，端掉延续千百年的小农经济架构，把全村变成了一个现代企业——干海资农工商联合公司，成为农业、工业、矿业、商业的经营联合体，它由１３个农业社、８个采煤队、１个建筑队和石灰厂、砖瓦厂、汽车厂、铁合金厂、冶炼厂、林业管理所、水库管理所、民族中学组成。
    这是魄力、远见和政策的产物，干海资发生了比建房还要深刻得多的变化。这个经济联合体的带头人，彝族农民企业家普光美，用一种通常经济学家才有的逻辑，给我们讲述了干海资的巨变：一、推行家庭联产承包责任制，促进了农业发展。现在全村一年能完成１７到１８万斤商品粮任务。二、用工业积累的资金投入兴修水利、科学种田，水有了，薄膜、农药化肥有了，粮食单产由二三百斤提高到了１３００斤；三、实行了农业剩余劳动力向非农劳动力的发展，促进了以煤为主的乡镇企业的发展。现在全村从事工业生产的就有６３０人，占全村劳动力的６０％以上。工业的发展壮大，积累了资金又促进了农业的发展，劳动力不外流了，姑娘不外嫁了；四、全村实现了免费医疗、免费上学，从学前班到中学毕业，不收学费、书费，现在全村学龄儿童入学率达到了１００％，巩固率达到了９０％，其中女学生人数占了４６％。从１９８４年到现在，村里在教育上投资达８０万元，学校从一座破庙迁到了山上新盖的大楼内，教具、设备全是新购买的；五、引进人、财、物，发展横向联系。近几年从昆明引进了６个工程师来帮助搞冶炼，引进了１４０多万元资金，联合办厂办电；六、加强智力投资，除在普教上的投资以外，还拿出１８万元培训各类技术人才１４０多名；七、每年投入２．５万元保护森林，促进生态平衡。现在全村的森林覆盖面从原来的４０％增加到了８０％，成材林达２．３万多立方米；八、同时抓精神文明建设。近年来，这个村的党支部发展了３６名党员，全村８４名党员都是改革、开放，振兴干海资的带头人。
    普光美用了四句话来概括干海资的经验：“以农业养家，靠工业发家，用人才保家，让政策当家。”这使我想起岔河那位村长的致富禅来：“靠山吃山”。两人在思想观念上差距是十分显然的。站在历史转机前的彝族人民，正在选择自己的未来。（附图片）
