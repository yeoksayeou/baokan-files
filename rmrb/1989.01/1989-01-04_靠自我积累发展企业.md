The Jincheng Mining Bureau in Shanxi Province borrowed 180 million yuan from the bank and raised over 700 million yuan on its own. It introduced advanced technology and renovated old equipment, transforming a backward mining area into a first-class enterprise nationwide. Their spirit of self-reliance is highly commendable.

Currently, some places and enterprises, when it comes to technological renovation and introducing advanced technology, immediately ask the state for money. It is entirely appropriate for the state to invest in necessary renovations and updates for some enterprises. However, if all enterprises rely on the state for funds, it would exceed the state's financial capabilities. For an enterprise to achieve substantial development, it should rely more on self-accumulation and accelerate self-development through self-reliance.

Using funds raised by the enterprise itself for technological renovation, every penny is hard-earned. Therefore, during the renovation and updating process, the enterprise will be meticulous and cost-effective, using the money where it is most needed. At the same time, it will strengthen management, shorten the construction period, and not be as wasteful as when spending state funds. This is the lesson we learn from Jincheng Mining Bureau's self-renovation and self-accumulation.

　　靠自我积累发展企业
    文阳
    山西晋城矿务局向银行贷款１８００万元，自筹资金７０００多万元，引进先进的技术，改造旧有设备，把一个落后的矿区改造成为全国第一流的企业，它们这种自力更生的精神，很值得提倡。
    现在，有些地方和企业，一提到技术改造和引进先进技术，就伸手向国家要钱。国家对一些企业进行必要的投资改造和更新，是完全应该的。但是，所有的企业，都想靠国家拿钱，就超出了国家财力的可能。一个企业要得到长足发展，就应当多靠自我积累，通过自力更生，加快自我发展。
    用企业自己筹措的资金，进行技术改造，每一分钱都显得来之不易，因此在改造和更新中，企业就会精打细算，把钱用在刀刃上，同时也会加强管理，缩短工期，不像花国家的钱那样，大手大脚，浪费严重。这是晋城矿务局自我改造、自我积累给我们的启示。
