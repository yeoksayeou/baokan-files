    Last year, China's road construction entered a new phase focused on improvement. During the Seventh Five-Year Plan, 42 high-grade roads were included in the national plan for new construction and reconstruction. So far, seven expressways have started construction, and some have already been completed and opened to traffic.

A total of 3,042 new road bridges were built, and some aspects of bridge design have reached international advanced levels. By the end of 1988, the total length of roads in the country had reached 997,600 kilometers, an increase of more than 120,000 kilometers compared to ten years ago.
