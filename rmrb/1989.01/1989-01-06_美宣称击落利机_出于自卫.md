U.S. Claims Shooting Down Libyan Plane "in Self-Defense"

    People's Daily, Washington, January 5th – Reporter Jing Xianfa reports: U.S. Secretary of Defense Carlucci stated yesterday that the U.S. action of shooting down a Libyan plane in international waters over the Mediterranean was "in self-defense."

    Six hours after the U.S.-Libya conflict occurred, Carlucci said at a press conference in the Pentagon, "The aircraft carrier 'John F. Kennedy' was then on patrol in international waters 204 kilometers off the Libyan coast in the Mediterranean. When two Libyan MiG-23 fighter jets approached, two F-14 fighter jets that had taken off from the 'John F. Kennedy' were approximately 80 kilometers north of the Libyan coast. The F-14 pilots changed their speed, altitude, and direction to avoid the approaching Libyan planes, but the Libyan planes repeatedly attempted to align their noses with the U.S. planes. They also continuously accelerated, thus obviously showing hostile intent." Carlucci said: When the (Libyan planes) were about 22.5 kilometers away, the F-14s used "Sparrow" radar-guided missiles and "Sidewinder" heat-seeking missiles to shoot down the two MiG jets. Carlucci admitted that the U.S. planes did not issue any warning signals before firing the missiles.

    The majority of members in both the U.S. House of Representatives and the Senate believe that this shooting down of the Libyan plane was a "justifiable defensive action."

　　美宣称击落利机“出于自卫”
    本报华盛顿１月５日电  记者景宪法报道：美国国防部长卡卢奇昨天宣称，美国在地中海国际水域上空击落利比亚飞机的行动是“出于自卫”。
    在美利冲突发生６小时之后，卡卢奇在五角大楼的记者招待会上说，“约翰·肯尼迪”号航空母舰当时正在距离利比亚海岸２０４公里处的地中海国际水域执行巡逻任务。当利比亚的两架苏制米格—２３战斗机逼近时，从“约翰·肯尼迪”号上起飞的两架Ｆ—１４战斗机距利比亚海岸以北大约８０公里。“Ｆ—１４的飞行员改变飞行速度、高度和方向，以避开逼近的利方飞机，但利方飞机每一次都设法将机头对准我方飞机。它们还不断加速，因此显然带有敌意。”卡卢奇说：当（利比亚飞机）距离大约２２．５公里时，Ｆ—１４用“麻雀”式雷达制导导弹和“响尾蛇”式热跟踪导弹将两架米格飞机击落。卡卢奇承认，美方飞机在发射导弹之前没有发出警告信号。
    美国国会参众两院大多数议员认为，这次击落利比亚飞机是“正当防卫行动”。
