After your newspaper published the letter from a reader titled “Orders Ignored, Private Coal Mines Cause Major Disasters” on the fifth page on April 20, 1988, the county committee and county government leaders of our county attached great importance to the issue. They decided to shut down seven illegal small coal mines in Niumasai Town, including Gaoqiao, Lutang, and Sanxing, which have significant hazards. They also required all illegal small coal mines in the entire county to close down as soon as possible.
