How to Strengthen and Improve Ideological and Political Work During Rectification and Ordering

Ruì Xìngwén Answers Questions from the "Party Building" Reporter

New China News Agency, Beijing, January 1, 1989

In the process of rectifying the economic environment and ordering the economic system, how should we strengthen and improve ideological and political work? Ruì Xìngwén, a member of the Secretariat of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China, answered questions from the "Party Building" magazine reporter on this matter. The full text of this interview will be published in the first issue of this year's magazine.

Q: The "Notice of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China on Strengthening and Improving Enterprise Ideological and Political Work" points out: Strengthening and improving ideological and political work is an important guarantee for the smooth progress of modernization construction and reform and opening up. Please discuss the relationship between "strengthening" and "improving."

A: Ideological and political work has always been one of our Party's political advantages. Comrade Deng Xiaoping has said: "Reform and modern science and technology, combined with our emphasis on politics, will have greater power." Under the current new historical conditions, the Chinese people are following the basic line of the Party in the primary stage of socialism, taking economic construction as the center, adhering to the four cardinal principles, and adhering to reform and opening up, building socialism with Chinese characteristics. To promote this magnificent and arduous cause, we must carry forward the fine tradition of the Party's ideological and political work, use the spiritual pillar of realizing the four modernizations and revitalizing China to unite the strength of the entire nation, inspire the enthusiasm of all the people for labor, reform and innovate, work hard and create, and strive to build a prosperous, democratic, and civilized socialist modernized country. The Thirteenth Plenum of the Third Session of the Central Committee determined the guiding principles of rectifying the economic environment, ordering the economic system, and deepening the reform comprehensively, requiring that the key tasks of reform and construction in the next two years be placed on rectifying the economic environment and ordering the economic system. To complete the arduous tasks of this crucial period of comprehensive deepening of reform, we must also strengthen ideological and political work, fully play the political advantages of our Party, unify thoughts, and unify actions.

To strengthen ideological and political work, we must improve ideological and political work. Ideological and political work has played an extremely important role in both the revolutionary war years and the socialist construction period. However, it must be admitted that under the influence of the "left" guiding ideology, especially during the "Cultural Revolution" turmoil, ideological and political work was also damaged and some shortcomings appeared. After the Third Plenum of the Eleventh Central Committee, although corrections were made with the shift of the Party's work focus, generally speaking, these shortcomings have not been completely eliminated.

At the same time, there have also been phenomena of weakness and dispersion in ideological and political work, and in many enterprises, the situation of ideological and political work being separate from production and operation still exists to a considerable extent. In the past, we practiced a planned commodity economy, and now we practice a socialist market economy. People's ways of thinking, values, standards of right and wrong, etc., have all changed greatly. The changes in the leadership system of enterprises, the changes in the structure of the workforce, the influence of various cultures under the open conditions, and the progress of socialist democratic politics, the strengthening of political transparency, and the modernization of our information dissemination means, all require that ideological and political work must be seriously improved in terms of system, content, and methods to truly enter the minds of the people and have cohesive and attractive power.

Q: Some comrades suggest that the current emphasis on strengthening ideological and political work and playing the Party's political advantages is because the reform has encountered problems. What is your opinion on this?

A: As I mentioned earlier, ideological and political work has always been one of our Party's political advantages. Our Party has always attached great importance to ideological and political work, and at the Sixth Plenum of the Twelfth Central Committee, the "Resolution of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China on the Guidance for the Construction of Socialist Spiritual Civilization" was adopted. Ideological and political work has played an important role in ensuring the smooth progress of modernization construction and reform. The recently concluded Third Plenum of the Thirteenth Central Committee also approved in principle the "Notice of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China on Strengthening and Improving Enterprise Ideological and Political Work." With the implementation of this "Notice," ideological and political work will certainly be raised to a new level.

Reform and opening up, building socialism with Chinese characteristics, is a magnificent and arduous cause that no one has undertaken before, and it is even more necessary to have lively and powerful ideological and political work as a guarantee. Strengthening ideological and political work is a need for the smooth progress of construction and reform, a need for the realization of the four modernizations and the revitalization of China, and it is not a temporary expedient. It is even less because "the reform has encountered problems" that we think of strengthening ideological and political work. It is a long-term strategic policy of our Party.

Q: Previously, the newspapers mentioned "reforming" ideological and political work, and now they mention "improving" ideological and political work. What is the essential difference between these two terms?

A: Ideological and political work faces new situations, new tasks, and new circumstances, and must restore some good traditions, discard those that are not good, and create some new things to truly strengthen it. In the process of considering how to strengthen ideological and political work, the Central Committee once had the idea of "reforming" ideological and political work, and also mentioned "reforming," "improving," and "enhancing." After soliciting opinions from various places and aspects and seeking opinions at the Central Work Conference held in September last year, the term "improving" was finally determined at the Third Plenum of the Thirteenth Central Committee. Whether it is "reforming" or "improving," "reforming" and "enhancing," the purpose is to make ideological and political work more powerful and effective.

Q: How do you evaluate the past ideological and political work? How do you evaluate the ideological and political work team?

A: I have actually answered this question earlier.

Ideological and political work has played an important role in both the revolutionary war years and the socialist construction period. The large amount of work done by the ideological and political work team in the past and present, the hard work they have put in, and the valuable contributions they have made have all been fully affirmed by the Party and the people. The quality of the ideological and political work team is generally good. After the Third Plenum of the Eleventh Central Committee, with the "four modernizations" construction of the cadre team, the ideological and political work team has also been supplemented with fresh blood. This is very precious.

Of course, to truly follow the spirit of the Central Committee and make ideological and political work continuously meet the needs of the new situation and new tasks, and to make it truly effective and lively, the quality of the ideological and political work team still needs to be improved. Ideological and political work cadres must continuously explore and create in practice, continuously summarize experience, and continuously improve their ability to do ideological and political work well.

Leadership by example is more important than verbal instruction. Comrades engaged in ideological and political work must maintain the style of strict self-discipline and setting an example for others. Whatever is required of the masses, one must first do it oneself; whatever is required to be resisted by the masses, one must first resist it. Ideological and political workers should influence others with their exemplary behavior, bring the warmth of the Party and the government to the masses, and truly become trusted confidants of the masses.

Q: Some people say that now that we are practicing a commodity economy, we rely on material and monetary incentives, and the role of ideological and political work is not significant. Please discuss your views on this understanding.

A: The "Resolution of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China on the Guidance for the Construction of Socialist Spiritual Civilization" points out: "Socialist spiritual civilization guided by Marxism is an important characteristic of socialist society. In the socialist period, material civilization provides material conditions and practical experience for the development of spiritual civilization, and spiritual civilization provides spiritual motivation and intellectual support for the development of material civilization, and provides a strong ideological guarantee for its correct direction of development. The construction of socialist spiritual civilization is a major issue related to the rise and fall of socialism." Comrade Deng Xiaoping said in early 1986: "We have done quite well in economic construction, the situation is gratifying, this is the success of our country. But if the atmosphere deteriorates, what is the meaning of successful economic construction? It will deteriorate in another aspect, affecting the overall economic deterioration, and if it develops, it will form a world of corruption, theft, and bribery." In the process of developing and perfecting the socialist market economy, we will encounter various kinds of ideological obstacles and problems, and we will also be affected by the infiltration of feudal and capitalist decadent thoughts. This requires us to use strong and meticulous ideological and political work to eliminate ideological obstacles and resist the influence of feudal and capitalist decadent thoughts, to ensure the healthy development of the socialist market economy.

Now, the practice of many places and units with achievements in ideological and political work proves that the smooth progress of reform and construction needs the guarantee of ideological and political work. The past view that only emphasized the role of the spirit, did not recognize the principle of people's material interests, and believed that ideological and political work is omnipotent is wrong. The current view that only emphasizes the role of material interests and believes that ideological and political work has become outdated and dispensable under the condition of developing a market economy is even more wrong. Building socialism with Chinese characteristics must, while attaching importance to the role of material, also attach equal importance to the role of the spirit, and strive to develop material civilization and spiritual civilization together.

Q: The "Enterprise Law" stipulates that the construction of the two civilizations in the enterprise is fully responsible by the factory director. Some comrades are concerned that this will lead to a new situation of party and government not being separated. Please discuss your views on this issue.

A: Enterprise ideological and political work is an indispensable important component of enterprise modernization management and an important guarantee for the realization of various tasks of the enterprise. As the legal representative of the enterprise, the factory director should naturally take both economic work and human work. If only production and operation are taken care of, and the ideological and technical education of the workers is not taken care of, their ideological and political quality and professional quality are not improved, and the strength of all the workers in the enterprise is not united, it will be difficult to participate in fierce competition and promote the progress of the enterprise.

Therefore, the factory director must be fully responsible for production and operation and ideological and political work. This practice is in line with the new leadership system of the enterprise, adapts to the requirement that ideological and political work is an important component of the overall management work of the enterprise, and provides organizational and institutional guarantees for changing the situation of ideological and political work being separate from production and operation.

This is not a new situation of party and government not being separated, nor is it replacing the party with the government. According to the partial amendment to the Party Constitution adopted at the Thirteenth National Congress and the notice of the Central Committee on implementing the "Enterprise Law," the enterprise is not a political power organization, and the role of the party organization in the enterprise is different from that of the central and local party committees in undertaking political leadership. The party organization in the enterprise no longer practices unified leadership over the unit, but should perform the function of ensuring and supervising, and should focus on strengthening the construction of the party itself, playing the role of the party organization as a fortress and the vanguard and model role of the party members. The party organization in the enterprise, as a primary organization of the party, in any region and unit, should lead the majority of party members to actively publicize the party's policies and propositions, unite the masses, do a good job of mass ideological work, and support the factory director to fully exercise his powers according to the "Enterprise Law." The factory director is fully responsible for the construction of the two civilizations in the enterprise, and the party organization in the enterprise ensures and supervises the implementation of the party and state policies in the enterprise. The two have the same overall goal, but their responsibilities are separated. The practice of some places and enterprises has proved that this approach can better promote the construction of the two civilizations in the enterprise.

Q: To make the factory director fully responsible for the construction of the two civilizations in the enterprise, what concepts should the factory director establish, and what qualities should he possess?

A: The "Enterprise Law" clearly stipulates that the factory director is the legal representative of the enterprise, occupying a central position in the enterprise, and is fully responsible for the material and spiritual civilization of the enterprise. To this end, in addition to being familiar with the production and operation of the enterprise and understanding the market, the factory director must also learn to do human work. He must respect, care for, and cherish people, and do human ideological work. He must know how to rely on the strength of the party organization, respect and give full play to the role of the trade union, the workers' congress, the youth league, and the women's federation and other mass organizations. He must learn to establish the spirit of the enterprise according to the requirements of "four haves," unite the strength of the enterprise, promote the progress of the enterprise, and improve the efficiency of the enterprise. Make the ideological and political work of the enterprise truly become an important component of the modernization management of the enterprise. The factory director and all comrades engaged in ideological and political work, like all of us, must, with a high sense of responsibility and political enthusiasm, strive to improve their own qualities, improve their ability to explain and solve practical problems with Marxism, learn to use new knowledge such as sociology, psychology, behavioral science, and modern management science to enrich and continuously improve our ideological and political work.

### 治理整顿中如何加强和改进思想政治工作　芮杏文答《党建》记者问

　　治理整顿中如何加强和改进思想政治工作
  　芮杏文答《党建》记者问
    新华社北京１月１日电  在治理经济环境、整顿经济秩序中如何加强和改进思想政治工作？中共中央书记处书记芮杏文就此事回答了《党建》杂志记者的提问。这家杂志今年第一期全文刊登了这篇问答。
    问：《中共中央关于加强和改进企业思想政治工作的通知》指出：加强和改进思想政治工作，是现代化建设和改革开放顺利进行的重要保证。请您谈谈“加强”和“改进”两者的关系。
    答：思想政治工作历来是我们党的政治优势之一。邓小平同志说过：改革和现代化的科学技术，加上我们讲政治，威力就更大了。在当前新的历史条件下，我国人民正在按照党在社会主义初级阶段的基本路线，以经济建设为中心，坚持四项基本原则，坚持改革开放，建设有中国特色的社会主义。推进这一宏伟而艰巨的事业，必须发扬党的思想政治工作的优良传统，用实现四化、振兴中华这一精神支柱，去凝聚全民族的力量，激发全体人民的劳动热情，改革开拓，艰苦创业，为建设富强、民主、文明的社会主义现代化国家而奋斗。十三届三中全会确定了治理经济环境、整顿经济秩序、全面深化改革的指导方针，要求把今明两年改革和建设的重点，突出地放到治理经济环境、整顿经济秩序上来。要完成全面深化改革这个关键时期的各项艰巨任务，同样必须加强思想政治工作，充分发挥我们党的政治优势，统一思想，统一行动。
    要加强思想政治工作，必须改进思想政治工作。思想政治工作无论在革命战争年代，还是在社会主义建设时期，都发挥过极其重要的作用。但也不可讳言，在“左”的指导思想影响下，特别是在“文革”的动乱中，思想政治工作也遭到了破坏，出现了一些弊端。十一届三中全会后随着党的工作着重点的转移，虽然进行了纠正，但总的看，这些弊端还没有完全消除。
    与此同时，思想政治工作中还出现了软弱涣散和不敢严格要求的现象，在许多企业中，思想政治工作与生产经营“两张皮”的状况，还相当普遍地存在着。过去搞产品经济，现在搞有计划的商品经济，人们的思维方式、价值观念、是非标准等，都发生了很大变化，企业领导体制的改变，职工队伍结构的变化，开放条件下各种思想文化的交汇和影响，再加上社会主义民主政治的推进，政治透明度的加强和我们的信息传播手段的现代化，思想政治工作要真正做到入耳入脑，具有凝聚力和吸引力，必须从体制、内容到方式方法进行认真地改进。
    问：有的同志提出，现在所以强调加强思想政治工作，发挥党的政治优势，是因为改革遇到了问题。请问您对此持何看法？
    答：上面我已经说过，思想政治工作历来是我们党的政治优势，我们党一直有很好的思想政治工作传统。十一届三中全会后，我们党同样很重视思想政治工作，并且在十二届六中全会上通过了《中共中央关于社会主义精神文明建设指导方针的决议》。思想政治工作在保证现代化建设和改革的顺利进行中，发挥了重要的作用。不久前召开的十三届三中全会，又原则通过了《中共中央关于加强和改进企业思想政治工作的通知》。随着这一《通知》的贯彻落实，思想政治工作必将提高到一个新的水平。
    改革开放，建设有中国特色的社会主义，是一项前人没有从事过的宏伟而艰巨的事业，更需要有生动的、强有力的思想政治工作做保证。加强思想政治工作，是建设和改革顺利进行的需要，是实现四化、振兴中华的需要，决不是权宜之计，更不是“因为改革遇到了问题”才想到要抓思想政治工作，而是我们党的一个长期的战略方针。
    问：前一段时间报上提“改造”思想政治工作，现在提“改进”思想政治工作，请问这两种提法有什么本质的区别？
    答：思想政治工作面临新形势、新任务和新情况，必须恢复一些好的传统，抛弃那些不好的东西，创建一些新东西，得到真正加强。在考虑怎么加强思想政治工作的过程中，中央曾有过思想政治工作要“改造”的提法，也提过要“改革”，“改善”，“改进”等。经过征求各地、各方面的意见，并在去年９月召开的中央工作会议上征求了意见，最后在十三届三中全会上确定了“改进”的提法。“改造”也好，“改进”也好，“改革”和“改善”也好，目的都是为了更有力、更有效地加强思想政治工作。
    问：您对过去的思想政治工作如何评价？对思想政治工作队伍如何评价？　
    答：关于这个问题，我在前面实际上已经回答了。
    思想政治工作在革命战争年代和社会主义建设时期都发挥了重要的作用，我们的思想政治工作队伍过去和现在所做的大量工作，付出的辛勤劳动，作出的宝贵贡献，都得到了党和人民的充分肯定。思想政治工作队伍的素质，总的说来是好的。十一届三中全会后，随着干部队伍的“四化”建设，思想政治工作队伍又补充了新鲜血液。这是很可贵的。
    当然，要真正按照中央精神，使思想政治工作不断满足新形势、新任务的需要，做到入耳入脑，生动有效，思想政治工作队伍的素质还需要有新的提高。思想政治工作干部要在实践中不断探索、创造，不断总结经验，不断提高做好思想政治工作的本领。
    身教重于言教。从事思想政治工作的同志，一定要保持严以律己、以身作则的本色。凡是要求群众做到的，自己首先要做到；凡是要求群众抵制的，自己必须首先抵制。思想政治工作人员要以自己的模范行为影响别人，把党和政府的温暖带给群众，真正成为受群众信赖的贴心人。
    问：有人说，现在搞商品经济，要靠物质和金钱的刺激，思想政治工作作用不大了。请谈谈对这种认识的看法。
    答：《中共中央关于社会主义精神文明建设指导方针的决议》指出：“以马克思主义为指导的社会主义精神文明是社会主义社会的重要特征。在社会主义时期，物质文明为精神文明的发展提供物质条件和实践经验，精神文明又为物质文明的发展提供精神动力和智力支持，为它的正确发展方向提供有力的思想保证。社会主义精神文明建设，是关系社会主义兴衰成败的大事。”邓小平同志在１９８６年初说过：“经济建设这一手我们搞得相当有成绩，形势喜人，这是我们国家的成功。但风气如果坏下去，经济搞成功又有什么意义？会在另一方面变质，反过来影响整个经济变质，发展下去会形成贪污、盗窃、贿赂横行的世界。”我们在发展和完善社会主义有计划的商品经济的过程中，会遇到各种各样的思想阻力和思想问题，也会受到封建主义、资本主义腐朽思想的侵袭，这就要求通过强有力的、深入细致的思想政治工作，来消除思想障碍和抵制封建主义、资本主义腐朽思想的影响，以保证社会主义商品经济的健康发展。
    现在很多思想政治工作有成绩的地方和单位的实践证明，改革和建设的顺利进行需要思想政治工作的保证。过去那种只强调精神作用，不承认人们的物质利益原则，认为思想政治工作万能的观点固然是不对的，现在这种只强调物质利益作用，认为在发展商品经济条件下思想政治工作已经过时、可有可无的观点更是错误的。建设有中国特色的社会主义，必须在重视物质作用的同时，同样重视精神的作用，做到物质文明和精神文明一起抓。
    问：《企业法》规定，企业的两个文明建设，由厂长全面负责，有的同志担心，这会不会导致新的党政不分，请您谈谈对这个问题的看法。
    答：企业思想政治工作是企业现代化管理不可缺少的重要组成部分，是实现企业各项任务的重要保证，身为企业法人代表的厂长，理所当然要经济工作和人的工作一起抓。如果只抓生产和经营，不抓职工的思想教育和技能教育，提高他们的思想政治素质和业务素质，凝聚全企业职工的力量，就很难参与激烈的竞争，推进企业的进步。
    所以，厂长必须对生产经营和思想政治工作全面负责。这一做法是与企业新的领导体制相配套的，适应了思想政治工作是整个企业管理工作的重要组成部分和要求，为改变思想政治工作与生产经营“两张皮”的状况，提供了组织和制度上的保证。
    这样做，不是新的党政不分，更不是以政代党。根据十三大通过的党章部分条文修正案和中央关于贯彻《企业法》的通知的规定，企业不是政权组织，企业中党组织的作用与中央和地方党委承担政治领导的作用不同。企业党组织不再对本单位实行一元化领导，而应行使保证监督职能，要以主要精力加强党的自身建设，发挥党组织的战斗堡垒作用和党员的先锋模范作用。企业党组织作为党的一级基层组织，在任何地区和单位，都要带领广大党员积极宣传党的方针政策和主张，团结群众，做好群众的思想工作，支持厂长按《企业法》充分行使职权。厂长对企业两个文明建设全面负责，企业党组织“对党和国家的方针、政策在本企业的贯彻执行实行保证监督”，两者的总目标是一致的，而职责是分开的。一些地方和企业的实践证明，这样做的结果，能够更好地推进企业的两个文明建设。
    问：为使厂长对企业的两个文明建设全面负责，厂长应该确立哪些观念，具备哪些素质？
    答：《企业法》明确规定，厂长是企业的法定代表人，在企业中处于中心地位，对企业的物质文明和精神文明负全面责任。为此，厂长除了必需熟悉企业的生产、经营，了解市场外，同时要学会做人的工作。要尊重人、关心人、爱护人，做人的思想工作。要懂得依靠党组织的力量，尊重和发挥工会、职代会、青年团和妇联等群众团体的作用。学会按“四有”的要求，树立企业精神，凝聚企业力量，推动企业进步和提高企业效益。使企业的思想政治工作真正成为企业现代化管理的一个重要组成部分。厂长和所有从事思想政治工作的同志一样，都要以高度的责任感和政治热情，努力提高自身的素质，提高用马克思主义说明和解决实际问题的能力，学习运用社会学、心理学、行为科学和现代管理科学等新知识，去丰富和不断完善我们的思想政治工作。
