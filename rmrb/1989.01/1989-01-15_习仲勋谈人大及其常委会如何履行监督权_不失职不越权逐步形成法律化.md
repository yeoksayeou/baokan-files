Hab Zhen Discusses How the National People's Congress and Its Standing Committee Should Exercise Their Supervision Powers

Not Neglecting Duties or Overstepping Authority, Gradually Forming Legalization

Xinhua News Agency reporter Chen Yan, People's Daily reporter Mao Lei report: Vice Chairman of the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress Hab Zhen pointed out at the internal and judicial supervision work symposium that concluded today that the National People's Congress and its Standing Committee, when exercising the supervision powers granted by the Constitution, must dare to supervise, be good at supervising, and achieve both not neglecting duties and not overstepping authority, making it gradually legalized and institutionalized.

The symposium, convened by the Internal and Judicial Affairs Committee of the National People's Congress, was held in Beijing on January 10.

Hab Zhen said in his speech at the meeting that the Internal and Judicial Affairs Committee of the National People's Congress is a new specialized institution established at the first session of the Seventh National People's Congress. It should strengthen legislative work and legal supervision, as well as work supervision. He said that the Internal and Judicial Affairs Committee assists the National People's Congress and its Standing Committee in exercising supervision powers, mainly through listening to reports, deliberating on bills, and inspecting law enforcement situations. Inspecting law enforcement situations is the foundational work for implementing supervision. We plan to inspect the law enforcement situations of various internal and judicial departments annually, with a focus on key areas.

Vice Chairman of the Internal and Judicial Affairs Committee of the National People's Congress, Zhuo Yu, made a speech at the closing ceremony today. He praised the lively and successful nature of this meeting. He said that strengthening the supervision of judicial departments by the power organs is an important aspect of developing socialist democracy and socialist legal system, a component of political system reform, and also the wish of the people. He believes that current legal supervision cannot keep up with the pace of legislation, and it is necessary to strengthen supervision to make judicial departments enforce the law more strictly, effectively punish criminals, and protect the legal rights of citizens.

Zhuo Yu also systematically expounded on the importance of strengthening legal supervision for maintaining citizens' democratic rights, developing socialist democracy, developing socialist commodity economy, maintaining social stability, and promoting people's unity.

Participants suggested that to strengthen the legal supervision work of the National People's Congress at present, it is necessary to further strengthen the propaganda of the nature, status, and role of the supervision work of the National People's Congress and its Standing Committee, creating a good social environment; at the same time, it is necessary to establish and improve the legal supervision institutions of the National People's Congress, promoting its own construction. They hope that the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress will formulate the supervision law as soon as possible, so that the supervision work can truly proceed on the track of institutionalization and legalization.

Chairman of the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress Wan Li and Vice Chairman Peng Chong met with all representatives during the conference.

Vice Chairmen of the Internal and Judicial Affairs Committee of the National People's Congress Li Ruishan, Peng Qingyuan, Jiao Shancen, and all members and advisors of the Internal and Judicial Affairs Committee also participated in the symposium.

　　习仲勋谈人大及其常委会如何履行监督权
    不失职不越权逐步形成法律化
    本报北京１月１４日电  新华社记者陈雁、本报记者毛磊报道：全国人大常委会副委员长习仲勋在今天结束的内务司法监督工作座谈会上指出，人大及其常委会在履行宪法赋予的监督权时，要敢于监督，善于监督，做到既不失职，又不越权，使之逐步形成法律化、制度化。
    由全国人大内务司法委员会召开的这个座谈会是１月１０日在京举行的。
    习仲勋在会上讲话中说，全国人大内务司法委员会是七届人大一次会议新成立的一个专门机构，要加强立法工作和法律监督、工作监督。他说，内务司法委员会协助人大及其常委会行使监督权，主要通过听取汇报、审议议案、检查执法情况等方式进行。检查执法情况，是实施监督的基础工作。我们打算每年都要有计划地、有重点地对内务司法各部门的执法情况进行检查。
    全国人大内务司法委员会副主任委员邹瑜在今天的闭幕会上作了发言。他称赞这次会议开得生动活泼，开得成功。他说，加强权力机关对司法部门的监督是发展社会主义民主与社会主义法制的重要方面，是政治体制改革的组成部分，也是人民群众的愿望。他认为，现在法律监督跟不上立法的步伐，必须加强监督，使司法部门更严明地执法，有效地惩治犯罪分子，维护公民的合法权益。
    邹瑜还系统地阐述了加强法律监督对维护公民民主权利，发展社会主义民主，对社会主义商品经济发展，对维护社会安定，促进人民团结的重要意义。
    与会者提出，当前要加强人大的法律监督工作，就要进一步加强对人大及其常委会监督工作性质、地位、作用的宣传，创造一个良好的社会环境；同时，要建立健全人大的法律监督机构，促进自身的建设。他们希望全国人大常委会尽快制定监督法，使监督工作真正走上制度化、法律化的轨道。
    全国人大常委会委员长万里、副委员长彭冲在会议期间会见了全体代表。
    全国人大内务司法委员会副主任委员李瑞山、彭清源、焦善民和内务司法委员会的全体委员、顾问也参加了座谈会。
