Sweden does not plan to join the European Community before 1992, but it is the EC's third-largest trading partner. How to strengthen cooperation with it is a major issue facing Sweden. The government and business community are taking measures to adapt to the construction of the single market.

Our reporter in Stockholm, Gù Yàomíng, reports: When asked by our reporter, "What is your biggest concern?" a Swedish industrialist replied simply: "1992."

The vice-president of the Swedish Industrial Association, J. Fritz, said, "How to cooperate with the potential single market within the European Community is the most important problem we must solve."

Sweden's dilemma is: due to its neutral foreign policy and international stance, Sweden does not consider joining the European Community before 1992. However, it hopes to share the benefits of the single market. Nevertheless, some member states of the European Community have expressed that countries like Sweden will not be able to enjoy the preferential treatment given to member states if they do not join the European Community.

J. Fritz pointed out that the European Community is Sweden's most important trading partner. Sweden's exports to European Community countries account for 50% of its total exports, while Sweden's imports from the European Community account for 57% of its total imports.

"In the short term, the free flow of goods and services planned by the European Community will affect Sweden's imports and exports with the European Community. If Swedish businesses cannot enter the European Community's capital and service markets, the consequences will be even more serious," J. Fritz said. "In the long term, it will have a negative impact on Sweden's industrial structure and economic growth."

The main concern of the business community is that some of their main competitors are within the European Community. In the 1990s, these competitors may reduce production costs due to the abolition of tariffs and simplification of procedures, putting Sweden at a disadvantage in competition. If Sweden cannot compete with European Community countries on an equal footing, the development of its emerging industries will be difficult. Moreover, the main purpose of the Community in establishing a single market is to more effectively counter the fierce competition from the United States and Japan. What position will Sweden be in in this competition? Fritz cited the pressure on the Swedish automotive industry from the large influx of Japanese cars since 1988, indicating that the business community's concerns about the development prospects are not without reason.

Since the second half of 1987, how to develop relations with the European Community and adapt to the process of integration has become the hottest topic in Swedish politics and business circles. Swedish Prime Minister Carlsson visited several European Community countries in the first half of last year to explain Sweden's policy. Carlsson emphasized, "We do not ask for the best part of the cake, we only ask not to be discriminated against in the European Community market." The Swedish business community, on the one hand, urges the government to develop relations with the European Community, and on the other hand, is eager to establish "bridgeheads" in European Community countries. In the past year, Swedish enterprises have been setting up factories, buying factories, merging companies, and purchasing real estate in European Community countries.

After talking with Swedish Deputy Minister of Foreign Trade Agde, the reporter's impression is that the Swedish government is more optimistic about developing relations with the European Community than the business community.

According to Agde, the Swedish government is currently actively promoting cooperation between the European Free Trade Association and the European Community, striving to eliminate obstacles among the 18 member countries of the two organizations, and achieve a "dynamic, unified European economic area." At the same time, the Swedish government is strengthening bilateral consultations with the European Community and is currently relaxing control over the financial market, reducing taxes, reducing restrictions on the movement of labor, and opening the food market to adapt to the policies of the European Community.

"Sweden wants to board the 'European train,' it can't get on without a ticket, can it?" Agde said humorously.

### 瑞典准备搭乘“欧洲列车”

　　瑞典准备搭乘“欧洲列车”
    内容提要：瑞典不想在１９９２年前加入欧共体，但它是欧共体的第三大贸易伙伴，如何加强同它的合作是瑞典面临的重大问题。政府和企业界都在采取对策，以适应大市场的建设。
    本报斯德哥尔摩电　记者顾耀铭报道：记者问瑞典工业界人士：“你们最大的忧虑是什么？”回答很简单：“１９９２年。”
    瑞典工业协会副理事长约·弗里兹表示：“如何跟有可能建立的欧共体内部大市场合作，是我们必须解决的最重要的问题。”
    瑞典的难题是：出于中立外交和国际政策，瑞典在１９９２年前不考虑加入欧共体。可它又希望分享大市场的利益。然而，欧共体一些成员国已表示，瑞典等国不加入欧共体，就不可能享受给予成员国的优惠。
    约·弗里兹指出，欧共体是瑞典最重要的贸易伙伴。瑞典向欧共体国家的出口占其出口总额的５０％，而瑞典从欧共体的进口占其总额的５７％。
    “从短期看，欧共体计划实行的商品和劳务自由流通将影响瑞典同欧共体的进出口。如果瑞典企业界不能进入欧共体的资本和劳务市场，其后果更为严重。”约·弗里兹说，“从长远看，对瑞典工业结构和经济增长都会产生消极作用。”
    工业界主要担心的是：他们的一些主要竞争对手是在欧共体内。到了９０年代，这些竞争对手将可能因取消关税、简化手续而降低生产成本，使瑞典处于不利的竞争地位。如果瑞典不能在平等条件下同欧共体国家竞争，其新兴工业的发展将是困难的，此外，共同体建立大市场的主要目的是为了更有效地对付美国和日本的激烈竞争。在这场竞争中，瑞典将会处于何种地位呢？弗里兹列举了１９８８年以来日本汽车大量销入给瑞典汽车工业造成的压力，说明工业界对发展前景存在的忧虑不无道理。
    自１９８７年下半年以来，如何发展与欧共体的关系，适应一体化进程，已成了瑞典政界和企业界最热门的话题。瑞典首相卡尔松去年上半年专程去欧共体一些国家解释瑞典的政策。卡尔松强调：“我们不要求得到蛋糕中最好的一部分，只要求在欧共体市场不受歧视。”瑞典企业界一方面敦促政府发展与欧共体的关系，另一方面又迫不及待地在欧共体国家抢先建立“桥头堡”。近一年来，瑞典企业在欧共体国家开厂、买厂或者合并公司、购买地产成风。
    记者在同瑞典外贸部部长助理阿格德交谈后得到的印象是：瑞典政府对发展与欧共体的关系比企业界要乐观。
    据阿格德介绍，瑞典政府目前一方面积极促使欧洲自由贸易联盟与欧共体的合作，争取在两大组织的１８个成员国之间消除障碍，实现“有活力的、统一的欧洲经济区”；另一方面瑞典政府加强同欧共体双边磋商，同时正在放松对金融市场的控制、降低税收、减少劳务流动限制、开放食品市场，以适应欧共体的政策。
    “瑞典想搭乘‘欧洲列车’，总不能无票上车吧。”阿格德诙谐地说。
