Title: Small Societies: A Major Malady in Chinese Enterprise Organizations

Every time a Chinese enterprise hires a worker, it incurs a fixed asset cost of 10,000 yuan, with 5,000 yuan allocated to welfare facilities, accounting for one-third of the total cost. The state regulates the use of enterprise retained profits, stipulating that 50% can be used for welfare expenditures. This means that at least half of the retained profits are consumed by welfare. The large proportion of welfare expenditures is due to the fact that Chinese enterprises are like mini-societies that encompass everything. Many large enterprises not only have employee housing, schools, hospitals, nurseries, clubs, and cultural and sports facilities, but even have their own food supply bases and labor service companies. In short, once an employee joins a company, many of their and their family members' expenses are borne by the enterprise. The term "urban village" vividly describes this phenomenon. The organizational form of enterprises acting as mini-societies has the following drawbacks:

First, it leads to a false sense of enterprise scale and the bloating of leadership and management structures. In terms of capital, up to one-third of the funds are not used in the production process but are spent on welfare facilities; at least 15% of the workforce are non-production personnel. Such an enterprise scale obviously cannot reflect the true scale efficiency and is often a "pyramid turned upside down."

Second, it is a major source of the expansion of non-production construction funds and consumption funds. This is not only because new enterprises always invest heavily in welfare facilities before forming production capacity, but also because welfare and production are intertwined, making it easy for production funds to flow into living welfare. This is the main reason why the expansion of consumption funds and non-production construction funds has been difficult to control in recent years.

Third, this organizational form hinders the mobility of the labor force, the transfer of enterprise property rights, and the reorganization of production. Workers want to move, but they are burdened with housing, childcare, and education issues; enterprises want to lay off workers, but they do not know how to ensure the livelihood of these workers after they are laid off; enterprises want to switch production, but they are constrained by the rigid composition of workers; the state wants to allow long-term loss-making enterprises to go bankrupt, but the first major problem is the placement of these workers.

Fourth, it reinforces the non-monetary tendency in the economic process. Incorporating welfare into enterprises opens the door to in-kind distribution and barter.

Fifth, it shackles entrepreneurs from focusing on running their enterprises and restrains the enthusiasm of workers. The issue of welfare has become a common phenomenon that hinders production in China today.

Sixth, it brings internal friction within enterprises due to disputes over welfare. In the distribution of welfare, the special privileges enjoyed by leaders are the biggest source of worker dissatisfaction, and conflicts among workers over the distribution of welfare lead to broader friction and conflict among people.

### 小社会：我国企业组织中的一大弊病

　　小社会：我国企业组织中的一大弊病
    我国企业每吸收一个职工，所需的固定资产费用为１万元；而所需的福利设施费用为５０００元，占总费用的１／３。国家对企业留利的使用有着这样的规定：其５０％可用于福利性支出，这也就是说至少留利的半数被福利吞噬了。福利性支出的这种巨大比重，是由于我国企业是一个无所不包的小社会所导致的。众多大企业不仅有职工住宅、学校、医院、托儿所、俱乐部、文体活动场所等，甚至有自己的副食品基地、劳动服务公司等。总之，一个职工一旦进了单位，他及其家属子女的许多费用就都由企业承担下来了。“都市里的村庄”是对这种现象的形象描绘。这种把企业办成小社会的企业组织形式具有以下弊端：
    第一，它带来企业规模的虚假高度和领导、管理机构的膨胀。我们的企业在资金量上，多达１／３的比重不是用于生产过程，却用于福利设施支出；而职工队伍中至少有１５％是非生产性人员。这种企业规模显然是不能反映出真正规模效益的高水分规模，有时甚至是“倒置的金字塔”。
    第二，它是非生产性建设资金和消费基金膨胀的主要根源之一。这不仅是因为新建企业总是要在形成生产能力之前先行大量投资于福利设施，而且主要是由于福利与生产交融在一起，使得生产资金极易流向生活福利方面。这也就是近年来消费基金和非生产性建设资金双膨胀屡禁不止的主要原因。
    第三，这种企业组织形式妨碍了劳动力流动、企业产权转让和生产组织重组。劳动者想流动，但身后却背负着住房、子女入托、入学等切身的问题；企业想辞退职工，但却不知这些职工失业后的生计如何得以保障；企业想转产，却又受到职工构成刚性的束缚；国家想让长期亏损的企业破产，但面临的第一大难题却是这些职工的安置问题。
    第四，强化了经济过程的非货币化倾向。把福利纳入企业之内，给实物分配和物物交换大开了方便之门。
    第五，给企业家全神贯注地运营企业带来了桎梏，给职工积极性发挥带来了羁绊。福利问题掣肘生产已成为我国目前普遍的现象。
    第六，带来了企业内部因福利争执而产生的内耗。在福利的分享中，领导者的特权享受是职工意见最大的，职工间在福利分享上的矛盾，则在更广的范围内带来了人与人之间的磨擦和冲突。
