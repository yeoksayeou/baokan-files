On November 30 of last year, a young man with tears streaming down his face, wearing cold handcuffs, was escorted by police into the detention center of the Public Security Bureau of Funan County, Anhui Province.

His name was Liu Weiyou, a resident of the Peace Neighborhood Committee in Chengguan Town. He originally had a happy family of three, with a virtuous wife, a lovely daughter, and he himself had a skilled electrical engineering technique, earning no less than 200 yuan per month. Life was comfortable and enjoyable.

Who would have thought that he would fall into the evil habit of gambling and slide step by step into the quagmire of crime?

Initially, he only played with small stakes like cigarettes and candies. As his desire to win money grew, his gambling addiction became more severe. If he didn't gamble for a day, his hands would itch and his mind would be filled with the sound of clacking mahjong tiles, consuming his soul. Family members' advice and friends' warnings fell on deaf ears. When his salary was lost, he started selling his property. In 1987, he lost 3,000 yuan, and in the first half of 1988, he lost over 1,000 yuan more.

The rule at the gambling table is: no money, no game. Money! Money! Where could he find enough money to satisfy his gambling addiction? There was nothing left to sell at home, and he couldn't face his relatives. At this point, a criminal thought emerged—stealing.

Soon, he succeeded. He stole an electric meter worth over 900 yuan from a construction unit, but due to the measures taken by the public security authorities after filing a case, he couldn't sell the stolen goods. The money wasn't in hand, but his gambling addiction was growing, so he harbored an even more evil intention—kidnapping children. On November 20 of last year, he lured his neighbor Liu Xueling's 5-year-old son, Xiaolong, to Gaoyang County, Hubei Province, intending to sell him for 2,600 yuan. Fortunately, the public security authorities tracked and investigated in time, and his plot was foiled.

Facing the iron bars and high walls, the free Liu Weiyou cried out in remorse: "Gambling! It was gambling that ruined me!"

　　赌博害了他
    去年１１月３０日，一个涕泪交流的男青年带着冰冷的手铐，在警察的押解下走进安徽省阜南县公安局看守所。
    他叫刘维友，是阜南县城关镇和平居委会居民。他原本有一个幸福的三口之家，妻子贤惠，女儿可爱，本人又有一手娴熟的电工技术，每月收入不下２００元，日子过得舒心快活。
    谁想到他竟然染上赌博恶习不能自拔，一步步滑向犯罪的泥潭。
    初涉赌场，他只是玩香烟糖果之类的小刺激。随着赢钱欲望的增加，他的赌瘾越来越大，一天不赌手就发痒，乒乓作响的麻将占据了他的脑海，蚕食了他的灵魂。亲人的规劝，朋友的忠告，他再也听不进。工资输光了，就变卖家产。１９８７年输掉３０００元，１９８８年上半年又输掉１０００多元。
    赌桌上的规矩是，没钱就别想进场。钱！钱！到哪里去寻得一笔满足赌瘾的钱？家产已无可变卖，亲戚那里也无脸上门。这时，一个罪恶的念头产生了——偷盗。
    很快，他得手了。他从一个施工单位偷到一只价值９００多元的电表，但由于公安机关立案侦查后采取了措施，他无法卖掉赃物。钱未到手，赌瘾又日益膨胀，于是，他又萌生了更加邪恶的歹念——拐卖儿童。去年１１月２０日，他将邻居刘学玲５岁的儿子小龙骗往湖北槁县，准备以２６００元卖掉。幸好公安机关跟踪侦查及时，他的阴谋才未能得逞。
    面对铁窗高墙，失去自由的刘维友痛悔地喊道：“赌博！是赌博害了我！”
