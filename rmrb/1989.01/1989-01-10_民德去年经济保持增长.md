East Germany's economy maintained growth in 1988. According to Xinhua News Agency in Berlin on January 6, the net national income of the German Democratic Republic (GDR) in 1988 increased by 3% compared to 1987. However, due to an 8% decrease in agricultural production, the original target of a 4.1% increase was not met.

From the performance data released by the Deutsche Nachrichtenbureau (DNB) today, it can be seen that although the GDR's national economy maintained a stable growth momentum in the past year, various major economic sectors did not achieve their planned targets. Compared to the previous year, the GDR's industrial net output and labor productivity both increased by 7%, which is 1% lower than the planned target. Industrial product output increased by 3.7%, consumer goods increased by 6.9%, and residents' net cash income and retail sales volume increased by 3.9%. Foreign trade achieved a surplus of 3 billion foreign exchange marks. In 1988, the total grain output reached 10 million tons.

　　民德去年经济保持增长
    新华社柏林１月６日电  １９８８年民主德国生产性国民收入比１９８７年增长３％，因农业减产８％，没有完成原定４．１％的增长指标。
    从德通社今天公布的计划执行情况来看，民主德国国民经济在过去一年里虽然仍保持稳定增长势头，但各个主要经济部门却未能完成计划指标。同上一年相比，去年民主德国工业净产值和劳动生产率均增长７％，比计划指标低１％，工业商品增长３．７％，消费品增长６．９％，居民纯现金收入和商品零售额增长３．９％。外贸获３０亿外汇马克的顺差。去年，粮食总产量达１０００万吨。
