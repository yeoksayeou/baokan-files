After your newspaper published the letter from some workers of the Marble Factory of the 5th Division of the 11th Engineering Bureau of the Ministry of Railways on September 17, 1988, the relevant departments organized a joint investigation team to conduct an investigation. The situation is basically true.

To maintain the seriousness of the family planning policy, the superior unit has given administrative demerits to the former director and secretary of the 5th Division Marble Factory. The Marble Factory has also given administrative demerits to 11 employees who had over-births from 1987 to 1988, fined them 800 yuan each, and deducted 10% of their basic salary.

Now, the new leadership of the factory is determined to do a good job in family planning and prevent over-births.

　　严肃处理杜绝超生
    你报１９８８年９月１７日第五版刊登铁道部第十一工程局五处大理石厂部分职工写的《我厂超生现象惊人》的读者来信后，有关部门组织联合调查组作了调查，情况基本属实。
    为维护计划生育政策的严肃性，上级单位已对五处大理石厂前任厂长、书记给予行政记大过处分；大理石厂还对１９８７年至１９８８年超生的１１名职工给予行政记大过处分，一次性罚款８００元，每人扣发基本工资１０％。
    现在，新上任的厂领导，决心抓好计划生育工作，杜绝超生。
