The Chinese ice hockey team has shown signs of improvement. This is the conclusion reached by Chinese ice hockey experts after watching the Harbin International Ice Hockey Invitational Tournament.

The Soviet Union's Khabarovsk team and the American Boston Club team, invited to participate in this tournament, are at the upper echelon of the world's C-group championships. The Chinese team competed under the name Harbin Xingguang Team. In 4 matches, they scored 12 goals and conceded 16, averaging a net loss of 1 goal per game, which basically reflects the level of the Chinese ice hockey team. So, in what ways has the Chinese ice hockey team shown improvement?

		Defensive Capabilities Have Improved

Defense has long been a problem for the Chinese team. National team leader Jiang Keyi told reporters that the newly reformed Chinese ice hockey team has made defense a key focus of their training, accounting for 70% of the total training time. In the first round of matches, the national team was able to draw 3-3 with the stronger Soviet Khabarovsk team, mainly due to the excellent performance of the defensive players. Their backtracking and positioning were quick, their man-marking awareness was strong, and they effectively suppressed the opponent's fast attacks. Players 4, Sun Dehong, and 17, Wang Hui, stood out. The former is 1.98 meters tall and weighs over 110 kilograms, earning the nickname "tank" on the ice. A few years ago, a visiting German coach praised him, saying, "Such a tall and agile player is rare even in European and American ice hockey teams." Wang Hui ran back and forth on the field, defusing many dangerous situations. Wang Hui has strong man-marking awareness and does not miss opportunities to assist actively. In the first match between China and the Soviet Union, when our team was trailing, he scored a goal from 15 meters away, which was considered the most brilliant shot of the tournament. Additionally, Zhang Zhenhua, Wang Fuping, and others also performed well.

		Fighting Spirit but Inconsistent Technical Performance

The most memorable aspect of this tournament was the Chinese team's relentless fighting spirit. During the matches, scenes of players diving to save the ball, blocking with their bodies, and playing through injuries were common. Veterans Wang Anfu and Tian Yuji, despite being in their mid-twenties, still showed strong offensive capabilities on the forward line and played key roles in the team.

However, the tournament also exposed some problems. Firstly, in the two matches against the Soviet team, the home team's performance varied greatly, with highs and lows in morale, indicating that the team's technical level is unstable and they are not yet a mature force. Secondly, in the second round against the Soviet team, there was a 4-minute period of "5 vs. 3," but the team failed to capitalize on the opportunity to score, revealing a weakness in set-piece situations. It is reported that the International Ice Hockey Federation has decided to reduce the number of promotion and relegation spots in the B and C groups from two to one, adding to the difficulties for the Chinese national team to advance to the B group.

　　回升势头可喜　晋级道路艰难
    ——从哈尔滨国际冰球赛看中国队
    中国冰球队水平有回升的趋势。这是我国冰球运动专家在观看了哈尔滨国际冰球邀请赛之后得出的结论。
    应邀参加这次比赛的苏联哈巴罗夫斯克队和美国波士顿俱乐部队相当于世界Ｃ组锦标赛中上游水平。中国队以哈尔滨星光队的名义参赛，在４场比赛中共进球１２个，失球１６个，平均每场净失球１个，基本反映了中国冰球队的水准。那么，中国冰球队水平有所回升表现在哪呢？
    　　　　防守能力有提高
    防守一直是中国队的难题。国家队领队姜可义告诉记者，重新组建的中国冰球队将防守列为全队训练的重点，占训练总课时的７０％。在第一轮比赛中，国家队之所以能以３比３逼和实力强于我队的苏联哈巴罗夫斯克队，主要是后卫队员表现出色，回防和补位比较快，盯人意识强，扼制了对手的快攻。４号孙德洪和１７号王辉表现突出。前者身高１．９８米，体重１１０多公斤，被称为冰场上的“坦克车”。前几年到我国访问比赛的联邦德国教练对他评价说，“如此高大而且动作灵活的队员，在欧美诸国的冰球队中也是少见。”王辉在场上左右奔跑，化解了许多险情。王辉盯人意识强，并不失时机地积极助攻。在中苏首场比赛我方比分落后的情况下，他距球门１５米远的地方大力射门成功，被称做此次比赛最精彩的射门。另外，张振华、王福平等都有良好表现。
    　　　　拚劲十足但技术发挥不稳定
    这次比赛给人们印象最深的是中国队队员拚劲十足。在比赛中，倒地救球、侧身封球、带伤病作战的场面屡见不鲜。王安福、田玉杰等老将尽管现已二十五六岁，但是在锋线上仍颇具威力，发挥队中骨干作用。
    从这次比赛中也暴露了一些问题。其一，同苏联队的两场比赛主队表现水平判若两队，情绪大起大落，说明全队技术水平发挥不稳定，尚不是一支成熟的军旅。其二，在中苏第２轮比赛中曾有４分钟的“５打３”，但是未能抓住时机破门，表现出不善于打阵地战的弱点。据悉，今年国际冰联决定Ｂ组和Ｃ组的升降级名额由原来的两个改为一个，为我国国家队打入Ｂ组平添了不少困难。
