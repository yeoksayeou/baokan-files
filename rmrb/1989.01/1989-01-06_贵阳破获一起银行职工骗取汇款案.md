Guiyang's Nanming Sub-bureau of the Public Security Bureau has cracked a case involving bank employees who, taking advantage of their positions, colluded to defraud a large sum of remittances. The suspects, Yang Wenping, Wen Ninghua, and Shen Yongqiang, have been recently detained, and most of the illicit funds have been recovered.

On November 17 of last year, Yang Wenping, an accountant at the Industrial and Commercial Bank of China's Guiyang Branch, colluded with Wen Ninghua and Shen Yongqiang, accountants at the Nanming District Office of the same system. Yang intentionally misallocated a remittance of 50,000 yuan from Guangdong to the account of Wen and Shen's office. The three then withdrew all the cash, with two of them fleeing the scene.
