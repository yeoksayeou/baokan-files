The city of Yancheng in northern Jiangsu was not particularly well-known nationwide, but in recent years, it has suddenly gained fame. The reason is not due to economic development or improvements in people's lives, but because it is the home of the red-crowned crane and produces the Yanwu brand of tape recorders. Red-crowned cranes stroll on the reed-covered beaches, and Yanwu brand tape recorders appear in television advertisements every evening. Thus, anyone who pays attention to the media knows about Yancheng. The fame of a place is similar to the fame of a person; it requires some unique features. Just being physically strong is not enough.

For people in Jiangsu Province, Yancheng was already quite famous, and this fame was due to two characteristics: it was an old revolutionary base; and it was notoriously poor. During the Cultural Revolution, it was called Jiangsu's Siberia. Many cadres and residents from Suzhou and Wuxi were exiled there to receive re-education from poor and lower-middle peasants, meaning to go to the most difficult places to receive re-education from poor and lower-middle peasants, with the most difficult places being the poorest.

My understanding of Yancheng began with these two characteristics. I went to Yancheng to participate in the revolution, singing songs along the way, and saw the shocking poverty there. However, that poverty inspired every young revolutionary to save the suffering masses from their misery. During our march, we borrowed a poor farmer's stove to cook, and when we lifted the lid, we saw that the farmer's food was a pot of elm leaves. Several intellectuals looked at each other in silence and rushed to eat the entire pot of leaves, then cooked a pot of rice and left it in the poor farmer's home. That was the first time in my life that I had to eat leaves to satisfy my hunger. I didn't know what they tasted like at the time; a sense of sacred mission overwhelmed everything: once the revolution was victorious nationwide, this farmer's pot would surely have rice or steamed buns.

Twenty years passed in a flash, and fate brought me back to the Yancheng area. This time, I had to rely on the suffering masses to save me; I was bringing my entire family to receive re-education. Upon returning to the Yancheng area, I almost shed tears. Twenty years had passed, especially in the counties near the sea, the rural scenery had hardly changed. Yellow hills, saline-alkali land, and small thatched huts made of mud were scattered across the fields. I didn't know if the poor farmer's pot still had elm leaves, but I knew that the work points in the production brigade I was going to were worth less than two jiao, with the lowest being eight fen, and the worst paying two fen per workday, a true miracle in the history of distribution according to work. If a person could go to hell to save others and make them ascend to heaven, there would still be a sense of self-sacrifice and some consolation. If going to hell also meant that others would be even deeper in hell, then one could only be speechless with grief.

Eighteen more years passed. Sometimes the flowing years are wasted, and sometimes they can irrigate barren land. Just nine years after my second departure from Yancheng, the mayor of Yancheng City invited writers from all over the country to hold a crane pen conference in Yancheng. Many people rushed to the seaside to see the red-crowned cranes and to the city to visit the Yanwu brand tape recorders, but I was busy looking for old friends and participating in various unorganized, unforced reminiscences of hardship and sweetness. "See for yourself, our little lives are also quite good now, we eat no worse than in Suzhou, and our living conditions have improved; we won't make you drink that 'big-head plague' anymore, we can soak you in good wine for three days!" If it weren't for wanting to live a healthy long life, I would be happy to soak myself in a wine vat. Before closing my eyes, I finally saw those small thatched huts made of mud disappear from the land of Yancheng, replaced by row upon row of red-tiled houses, which under the clear blue sky seemed almost magnificent. If viewed with European eyes, it might seem crude, but those who have lived in mud huts for generations can now live without fear of wind and rain, without having to press down on the roof during strong winds, and without having to rush out of the house during heavy rain to protect the walls from collapsing. I do not oppose the building boom in the countryside; half of it is a symbol of prosperity, and half of it is a manifestation of being tired of poverty and hardship. The poor farmer's pot will no longer have elm leaves, and the newly built stove might be tiled with ceramic tiles. The shocking poverty has finally passed, although it took 38 years, slow progress is better than no progress or regression, especially since we only had eight or nine years to eliminate disasters, and the rest of the time was spent creating them.

The people of Yancheng finally have the leisure to protect rare birds and beasts and can also manufacture Yanwu brand tape recorders. Protecting wildlife and listening to music and operas are civilized and noble behaviors, but they can only be enjoyed after one is full. If one is starving and has to eat elm leaves, then the red-crowned crane, except for its red crown, can also be used to fill one's stomach.

### 燕鹤之乡

专栏：燕舞散文征文

　　燕鹤之乡
    陆文夫
    苏北的盐城，本来在国内并不太有名，这些年突然名闻遐迩，原因倒不是因为生产的发展和人民生活的改善，而是因为它是丹顶鹤的家乡，同时出产燕舞牌的收录机。丹顶鹤漫步在芦草没膝的海滩上，燕舞牌的收录机每晚出现在电视台的广告节目里，于是，大凡注意一下传播媒介的人，便都知道了盐城。一个地方的出名和一个人的出名相同，总要有点特色，光靠身体健壮是不行的。
    对于江苏省的人来讲，盐城原先就是很有名的，所以有名也是因为有两个特点，一是革命的老根据地；二是穷得有名气。在“文革”期间它被称为江苏省的西伯利亚，大批苏州和无锡的干部、居民都被流放到那里，即所谓到最艰苦的地方去接受贫下中农再教育，最艰苦者即最贫穷之意也。
    我对盐城的了解是从后两个特点开始的，当年唱着歌到盐城去参加革命，看到了那惊人的贫困，可那贫困却激励着每个热血青年，准备用生命去拯救劳苦大众于水深火热。在行军的途中，我们借一户贫农的锅灶烧饭，揭开锅来一看，农民的食物是一锅榆树叶。几个知识分子相对无言，抢着把一锅树叶吃光了，烧一锅米饭留在贫农的家里。那是我生平第一次用树叶充饥，吃的时候不知其味，一种神圣的使命感压倒了一切：等到革命在全国胜利之后，这家农民的锅子里肯定会有大米饭或白馒头。
    一晃过了２０年，命运又驱使我回到盐城地区去，这一次要靠劳苦大众来拯救我了，我是带着全家来接受再教育的。回到盐城地区一看，差点儿要流下眼泪，２０年过去了，特别是临近海边的几个县，那农村的景象几乎没有什么改变。黄土坡，盐碱地，泥土垒成的小茅屋散布在田野里。我不知道那户贫农的锅子里是否还有榆树叶，可我知道我要去的生产队工分值不到两毛钱，低的只有八分，最差的做一工要倒贴两分钱，实在是按劳分配史上的一个奇迹。一个人如果自己入地狱而使其他的人都能升入天堂的话，那还会有一种自我牺牲的正义感，还会得到一点安慰。如果自己入地狱还会使其他的人更在地狱的下面，那也就只能是欲哭无泪。
    忽忽又过了１８年，那似水的年华有时候付诸东流，有时候也能浇灌贫瘠的土地。就在我第二次离开盐城９年之后，盐城市的市长广招天下文客，在盐城召开了丹顶鹤笔会。许多人都赶到海边去看丹顶鹤，到市内去参观燕舞牌收录机，我却忙着去寻访亲朋故友，参加各种无人组织、无人强制的忆苦思甜。“看见了吧，我们的小日子也过得可以了，吃得不比苏州差，住的也有了改善；现在再也不会让你喝那种‘大头瘟’了，我们能用好酒把你泡三天！”如果不是想健康长寿的话，我倒也乐意把自己浸泡在酒缸里，在瞑目之前总算看到那些用泥土垒成的小茅屋从盐城的大地上消失殆尽，代之而起的是一幢幢的红瓦房，在湛蓝的天空下简直有点辉煌。如果用欧洲的眼光来看当然显得简陋，可那些世世代代住在泥土小屋里的人从此可以不愁风雨，用不着在大风刮起的时候拚命地向屋上压东西，用不着在大雨瓢泼的时候反而奔到屋外去护山墙，免遭墙倒壁塌的危险。我不反对农村里的建房热，那一半是富裕的象征，一半是穷怕了、苦够了的表现。那户贫农的锅子里再也不会有榆树叶了吧，那新砌的灶台也许会用瓷砖贴面。惊人的贫困终于过去了，虽然花掉了３８年，慢啊，可是慢进比不进、倒退总要好一点，何况我们用于消灭灾难的时间也只有八九年，其余的大部分时间都是用来制造灾难的。
    盐城人终于有闲情来保护珍禽异兽了，还能够制造燕舞牌收录机。保护野生动物，听听音乐戏曲都是文明高尚的行为，但也只有在吃饱了以后才玩得起。如果饿得要吞榆树叶的话，那丹顶鹤除掉鹤顶不能吃，其余的也可拿来充饥。
