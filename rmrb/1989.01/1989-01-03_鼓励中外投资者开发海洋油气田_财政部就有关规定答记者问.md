The Ministry of Finance recently responded to questions from reporters regarding the "Regulations on the Payment of Mineral Area Usage Fees for the Exploitation of Marine Petroleum Resources."

	Q: Why was the regulation on mineral area usage fees established?
	A: Since the implementation of the open-door policy, cooperation between China and foreign entities in the exploitation of marine petroleum has seen significant development. As of now, over ten oil and gas fields have been discovered, with some entering the development stage. However, for several years, the state has not had a unified regulation on mineral area usage fees, only stipulating in petroleum contracts that 12.5% of the annual total production of an oil field should be used to pay mineral area usage fees, resulting in the issue of "having fees without laws." To encourage domestic and foreign investors to develop oil and gas fields, it is necessary to establish and improve the regulations on mineral area usage fees.

	Q: What are the principles for setting mineral area usage fees?
	A: Petroleum is a major underground resource of a country and an important strategic material. Most oil-producing countries worldwide impose mineral area usage fees on exploiters. To safeguard the interests of China's state-owned resources and reasonably handle the distribution of interests between the state and the developers, the "Regulations" follow the principle of lighter fees for small and medium-sized oil and gas fields and slightly heavier fees for large oil and gas fields. Considering China's current situation, relatively preferential mineral area usage fee rates are set, aiming to encourage investment and promote the development of oil and gas fields.

	Q: What incentives are included in the "Regulations"?
	A: Firstly, the original contract fee rate of 12.5% has been changed to a progressive fee rate based on excess production, significantly reducing the mineral area usage fee burden for small and medium-sized oil and gas fields and slightly reducing the burden for large oil and gas fields. Secondly, mineral area usage fees are exempted for the portion of annual crude oil production not exceeding 10 million tons or annual natural gas production not exceeding 2 billion cubic meters. According to calculations, after the implementation of these "Regulations," the actual burden rate for oil fields with recoverable reserves of less than 50 million tons will be zero; for oil fields with reserves between 50 million tons and 200 million tons, the actual burden rate will be approximately 2%; for oil fields with reserves between 300 million tons and 5,000 million tons, the actual burden rate will be approximately 4% to 6%; for oil fields with reserves around 1 billion tons, the actual burden rate will be approximately 8%. This burden level is relatively low compared to other countries, which is beneficial for encouraging domestic and foreign enterprises to invest and promote the development of marine petroleum resources.

　　鼓励中外投资者开发海洋油气田
    财政部就有关规定答记者问
    新华社北京１月２日电  财政部负责人日前就财政部发布的《开采海洋石油资源缴纳矿区使用费的规定》，回答了记者提出的有关问题。
    问：为什么要制定矿区使用费规定？
    答：实行开放政策以来，中外合作开采海洋石油业务有了较大的发展。到目前已经发现的油、气田有１０多个，部分油、气田正进入开发阶段。但是，几年来国家对矿区使用费一直没有制定统一的法规，只是在石油合同中确定，油田年度总产量的１２．５％用以缴纳矿区使用费，存在着“有费无法”的问题。为了鼓励中外投资者开发海洋油、气田，有必要建立、健全完善矿区使用费法规。
    问：制定矿区使用费的原则是什么？
    答：石油是一个国家主要的地下资源，也是重要的战略物资。世界各产油国，普遍对开采者征收矿区使用费。为维护我国国有资源的权益，合理处理国家与开发者的利益分配关系，《规定》本着中小油气田从轻、大油气田略重的原则，同时结合我国当前的实际情况，设置了较为优惠的矿区使用费率，其目的在于鼓励企业投资，促进油、气田的开发。
    问：《规定》中有何鼓励措施？
    答：首先是把原来合同中规定的１２．５％的费率改为超量累进费率，使中小油气田的矿区使用费负担大大减轻，大油气田的负担也有所下降。其次是对年产原油不超过１００万吨的或者年产天然气不超过２０亿立方米的部分给予免征矿区使用费。据测算，这个《规定》实施以后，可采储量小于５００万吨的油田实际负担率为零；５００万吨至２０００万吨的油田实际负担率约为２％；３０００万吨至５０００万吨的油田实际负担率约为４％至６％；１亿吨左右的油田实际负担率约为８％。这样的负担水平，同其它国家相比是中间偏低的，有利于鼓励中外企业投资，促进海洋石油资源的开发。
