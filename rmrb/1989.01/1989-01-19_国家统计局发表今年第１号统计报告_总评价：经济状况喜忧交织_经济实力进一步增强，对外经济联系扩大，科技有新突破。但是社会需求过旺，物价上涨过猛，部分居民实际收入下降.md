Edition: 2

The National Bureau of Statistics issued its first statistical report for the year on January 18, providing an initial analysis of China's national economic performance in 1988. The overall assessment is that while the national economy continued to develop, economic strength was further enhanced, external economic ties expanded, and there were new technological breakthroughs, there were also significant challenges. Long-standing supply-demand imbalances and structural issues have intensified, leading to excessive social demand, noticeable inflation, rapid price increases, and a decline in the real income of some residents. The economic situation is a mix of both positive and negative aspects.

		Main Achievements in Economic Development

Economic growth continued, and economic strength was further enhanced. Preliminary calculations indicate that China's Gross National Product (GNP) for 1988 was 1,369.4 billion yuan, an 11.2% increase over the previous year. National income was 1,133.8 billion yuan, an 11.4% increase. The economic growth rate was not only significantly higher than that of Western developed countries but also higher than that of developing countries, making China one of the few countries with rapid economic growth. The rural economy remained active. The total rural social output value is estimated to have reached over 1,100 billion yuan, a more than 10% increase over the previous year. Of this, agricultural output value was 530 billion yuan, a more than 2% increase. Excluding a decline in planting, forestry, animal husbandry, sideline occupations, and fisheries all saw varying degrees of growth. Among the main agricultural products, grain, cotton, and oilseed production decreased, while most other agricultural products increased. Sugar production reversed a two-year decline, with a significant increase in output. Meat, poultry, eggs, dairy, and aquatic products all saw varying degrees of increase.

Industrial supply increased effectively. The total industrial output value of township and town-level enterprises exceeded 1,500 billion yuan, a 17.7% increase over the previous year; including village-level and below village-level industries, the increase was approximately 20%. Among these, major light textile products, energy, raw materials, agricultural support, and export products all saw varying degrees of increase over the previous year.

Transportation continued to develop under tight operations. The total freight turnover was 2,000.6 billion ton-kilometers, a 4.7% increase over the previous year; passenger turnover was 562.3 billion passenger-kilometers, an 11.4% increase; port throughput was 436 million tons, a 10% increase.

A batch of construction projects were completed and put into operation, increasing production capacity. It is estimated that 40,000 construction projects with an investment of over 500,000 yuan each were completed and put into operation, and over 40,000 renovation projects were completed. In the construction of energy, transportation, and raw material industries, several key projects were completed and put into operation. Newly added generating capacity was 9.44 million kilowatts, crude oil production capacity was 15.76 million tons, raw coal production capacity was 30.9 million tons, coastal port throughput capacity was 74.4 million tons, double-track railway operational mileage was 830 kilometers, electrified railway mileage was 1,470 kilometers, production capacity for 10 types of non-ferrous metals was 1.2 million tons, and ethylene production capacity was 600,000 tons.

External economic exchanges expanded. The total import and export volume for the year is estimated to have reached $102.9 billion, a 24.4% increase over the previous year. Of this, exports were $47.6 billion, a 20.8% increase; imports were $55.3 billion, a 28% increase. Excluding donations, processing trade, and compensatory trade, the general trade deficit was $2.5 billion. The non-trade surplus was $3.6 billion. There were new developments in utilizing foreign capital, with the structure becoming more rational. It is estimated that $8.8 billion in foreign capital was actually utilized, a 16.2% increase. Foreign investment showed new characteristics: an increase in wholly-owned enterprises, active investment by Taiwanese compatriots, a predominance of industrial projects, and an increase in export-oriented projects.

New breakthroughs were made in the field of science and technology. In 1988, the state approved 217 invention awards and 515 science and technology progress awards. The successful launch of a practical communication satellite, the successful launch of a submarine-launched missile, the successful collision of the Beijing Electron-Positron Collider, the completion of the Lanzhou Heavy Ion Accelerator, and the successful first rocket sounding experiment in the low-latitude region all indicate that China's science and technology, especially in the field of high technology, have made new breakthroughs.

The work of rectification and adjustment began. In the fourth quarter of 1988, various regions began to implement the central government's "rectification, adjustment, reform, and improvement" policy. By the end of November, 10,220 investment projects nationwide were decided to be suspended or delayed, which could reduce future investments by 33.4 billion yuan. A batch of companies with unclear government-enterprise boundaries were rectified, and a batch of "official speculators" and "private speculators" were dealt with. Due to the promotion of savings activities such as value-preserving savings and prize-saving, residents' savings rebounded, and the average monthly net increase in savings in the fourth quarter had basically returned to normal levels. By the end of the year, the balance of urban and rural residents' savings deposits reached 379.8 billion yuan, an increase of 72.5 billion yuan, a 23.6% increase from the beginning of the year.

		Main Problems in Economic Development

The imbalance between supply and demand further intensified. The supply-demand gap widened. The total social demand for the year is estimated to have increased by 22.1% over the previous year; total supply increased by 19.3%. The supply-demand gap ratio increased from 13.6% in the previous year to 16.2%. In total demand, the consumption demand growth rate soared from 14.7% in the previous year to 26.5%; of this, banks paid 317.9 billion yuan in wages and other cash to urban residents, a 26.5% increase over the previous year. Investment demand continued to expand. It is estimated that the total fixed asset investment for the whole society for the year will exceed 430 billion yuan, exceeding the planned control target by over 130 billion yuan; the total investment scale of projects under construction will exceed 1.3 trillion yuan, of which state-owned units will exceed 1 trillion yuan. The gap between commodity supply and purchasing power widened. The total commodity purchasing power is estimated to be around 870 billion yuan, a 27% increase over the previous year, with a gap of around 80 billion yuan between supply and purchasing power, and market pressure is increasing. Excessive monetary issuance increased significantly, bank credit was unbalanced, and the deposit-loan gap widened; monetary issuance far exceeded the plan.

Structural contradictions became more prominent. The distribution structure was unreasonable, and social income distribution was overly tilted towards individuals. The proportion of residents' income in GNP increased from 59.9% in 1984 to 62.6% in 1988. Meanwhile, residents' consumption areas remained narrow, mainly concentrated in food, clothing, and daily necessities, with a low proportion of housing, transportation, and various non-commodity consumption, and a prominent tendency towards high consumption that is detached from national conditions. Social group consumption grew too fast. In 1988, the total value of consumer goods purchased by social groups reached 66.5 billion yuan, a 20.3% increase over the previous year, far from the planned reduction of 20%.

Industrial structure imbalances became more severe. First, the super-high-speed growth of industry and the low-speed growth of agriculture exacerbated the imbalance between industry and agriculture. The growth rate ratio of industry to agriculture expanded from 3:1 in the previous year to over 7:1; the proportion of agriculture in the total industrial and agricultural output value decreased from 29.7% in 1984 to around 25%, basically returning to the level before rural reforms in 1978. Second, within industry, there were two unreasonable biases: the enterprise structure tilted towards township and village enterprises, and industrial production saw rapid development in township and village industries, with township enterprises growing by 35% and village enterprises growing even faster, making resource allocation more unreasonable; industrial structure tilted towards processing industries, with the rapid growth of processing industries and the relative lag in energy, mining, and raw material industries. In the total industrial output value for the year, processing industries grew by 23%, while mining and raw material industries grew by only 10.8%. Third, within agriculture, the production of basic products such as grain, cotton, and oil was unstable, with production decreases not matching the accelerated population growth, leading to prominent supply-demand contradictions. In 1988, the total grain production was 394 million tons, a 2.3% decrease; cotton production was 4.06 million tons, a 4.3% decrease; oilseed production was 12.85 million tons, a 15.9% decrease. In the past three to four years, grain, cotton, and oilseed production have fluctuated, while the population has grown rapidly, with the natural population growth rate in 1988 reaching 15.73‰, the highest since 1975. It is estimated that the national population will exceed 1.1 billion in March or April 1989, and the supply pressure for agricultural and sideline products will continue to increase. Grain shifted from net exports in 1985-1986 to net imports, with 16 million tons of net grain imports in 1987-1988, and grain, cotton, and edible oil inventories decreased by the end of 1988. Fourth, the high-speed development of the national economy and the slow growth of transportation capacity coexisted, further exacerbating the transportation tension.

Market fluctuations and excessive price increases. The volume of commodity sales surged, and the retail market saw significant fluctuations. The total retail sales of social commodities for the year reached 744 billion yuan, a 27.8% increase over the previous year; excluding price factors, the actual increase was 7.9%. By quarter, the first quarter saw a 23.1% increase, the second quarter a 26.2% increase, the third quarter a 34.6% increase, and the fourth quarter a 27.4% increase, with the largest fluctuations between quarters since the founding of the nation. Especially, the continuous panic buying further increased market pressure. Preliminary estimates indicate that about 20% of the increase in total retail sales was due to abnormal sales caused by panic buying. The shortage of commodities expanded, with structural contradictions and total shortages coexisting. Most commodities had incomplete varieties and specifications.

Due to excessive demand and price competition among some regions and units, it is estimated that the overall retail price level for the year increased by 18.5% over the previous year, and the living cost index for workers and staff increased by 20.7%, both unprecedented since the founding of the nation. While consumer prices rose, the prices of production materials also surged. In the first three quarters of 1988, the price index for the sale of 15 major production materials by the materials department increased by 18.5% compared to the same period last year, far exceeding the 6.1% increase in the same period in 1987. Among these, steel prices increased by 20.9%, and copper and aluminum prices increased by nearly 40%. Due to the large increase in prices, the burden on the state, enterprises, and individuals increased. In the first 11 months, in addition to the explicit subsidies for workers, various implicit price subsidies reached 27 billion yuan. Most of the increased income of residents was "eaten up" by price increases. The rapid price increases not only formed a major economic problem but also had a serious political impact.

The economic order in the circulation sector was chaotic. Due to the implementation of the "dual-track" pricing system in an environment where demand exceeds supply, the circulation sector was profitable, leading to a wave of "business fever" in society. Coupled with the lack of clear policy boundaries in circulation, a large number of "speculative buying and selling" phenomena emerged, with prominent middleman exploitation, and the economic order was seriously chaotic.

		Outlook and Suggestions

Looking ahead to 1989, the national economy will operate under tight conditions and progress through adjustment.

Agriculture: Production is expected to rebound, but achieving the planned targets will be difficult. In 1989, various levels of government will strengthen their leadership in agricultural production and construction, and agricultural supporting services are expected to be enhanced. Coupled with strong market demand and large price increases, this will have a certain stimulating effect on farmers. If there are no major natural disasters, production is expected to rebound. However, it is noteworthy that due to unreasonable price ratios, cotton farmers' enthusiasm is low, and major cotton-producing areas generally show a reluctance to plant cotton. If effective measures are not taken, cotton production may slip again. Pig production is affected by grain price increases, high and scarce feed prices, tight procurement funds, and falling piglet prices, and farmers' enthusiasm for pig farming is still unstable. Therefore, agricultural production must be given great attention, and relatively realistic measures must be taken to stabilize and improve policies for developing agriculture, further mobilize farmers' production enthusiasm, and strive to achieve a good harvest.

Industry: Production speed will slow down but will not experience a major decline. In a tight operating environment, industrial production, especially heavy industry production, will be constrained by factors such as funds, energy, raw materials, transportation, and investment cuts and demand suppression. However, due to the market demand pull for industrial production, fiscal pressure, and contract incentives still in place, it is estimated that production will still maintain a relatively high speed, with the first quarter exceeding 10% and the full year not lower than 10%. Therefore, relevant departments must focus on adjusting industrial structure, product structure, and enterprise structure, adopt preferential policies, allocate a portion of funds and other production factors, and support adjustment work through selective measures. Through measures of both support and suppression, effective supply will be increased, and excessively high speeds will be reduced.

Investment: Will be controlled but reducing the scale will be difficult. With various regions further implementing the State Council's notice on cleaning up fixed asset investment projects and reducing the investment scale, budgeted investment in 1989 is expected to be further reduced. However, there is still a lack of effective methods to control and guide off-budget investment, and truly reducing the overly large investment scale will be difficult. At the same time, the contradiction of insufficient funds for key construction projects will continue to intensify. Therefore, while cleaning up fixed asset investments, necessary investment tax policies should be formulated, and off-budget investments should be guided and managed to truly achieve the reduction of scale while adjusting the structure. The focus of controlling investment growth should be on strictly approving new projects, and establishing management regulations for new projects.

Market: There are many potential unstable factors, and it will be difficult to suppress price increases. The task of stabilizing prices and the market in 1989 will be challenging. First, there are many legacy issues from 1988, and the carryover factor alone will cause the price index to rise by about 8% in 1989. A significant portion of the excessively issued currency will need to be absorbed through price increases. Second, new price adjustment measures will need to be introduced, and chaotic price increases and free-riding phenomena may still occur. Third, the supply-demand gap will still be difficult to fill. Fourth, consumers' wait-and-see and cash-hoarding mentality is strong. In the annual surplus purchasing power, residents' cash holdings increased from 18.9 billion yuan at the end of 1987 to over 54 billion yuan at the end of 1988, with the proportion increasing from 18.5% to 43.1%, easily triggering market fluctuations. It is crucial not to be complacent. Strengthen the management of market prices, focus on controlling the prices of basic necessities such as grain, oil, meat, sugar, vegetables, salt, and cloth, as well as agricultural production materials, and do not allow arbitrary price increases. Delay the introduction of price adjustment measures as much as possible, implement the policy of small adjustments and large stability, build public confidence, and eliminate panic. Especially, adopt various methods to significantly increase residents' savings deposits and enhance the ability to recover credit. Improve various publicity efforts, honestly inform the people of the difficulties, gain the people's support, and work together to overcome the challenges.

① The absolute values of GNP, national income, total industrial and agricultural output value, and total rural social output value are calculated at current prices, and the growth rates are calculated at comparable prices.

② In 1988, the global economic growth rate was 3.7%, developed countries 3.8%, developing countries 3.6%, the Soviet Union and Eastern European countries 4%, and the "four little dragons" in Asia approached 10%.

③ For village-level and below village-level industries, according to relevant survey data, the "water" has been deducted.

④ According to the Ministry of Foreign Economic Relations and Trade statistics, the export volume in 1988 was $40.1 billion, a 15.5% increase over the previous year; the import volume was $39.3 billion, a 17.7% increase. The surplus was $800 million. The difference with customs statistics is mainly due to different statistical methods and scopes. In addition, there are omissions in the import and export statistics outside the Ministry of Foreign Economic Relations and Trade system.

　　国家统计局发表今年第１号统计报告
    总评价：经济状况喜忧交织
    经济实力进一步增强，对外经济联系扩大，科技有新突破。但是社会需求过旺，物价上涨过猛，部分居民实际收入下降
    本报讯　国家统计局１８日发表今年第１号统计报告，对１９８８年我国国民经济运行状况进行了初步分析，总评价是：１９８８年我国国民经济持续发展，经济实力进一步增强，对外经济联系扩大，科技取得新突破。但是，多年积累下来的供求矛盾和结构性矛盾加剧，集中表现在社会需求过旺，通货膨胀明显，物价上涨过猛，部分居民实际收入下降。经济状况喜忧交织。
    　　　　国民经济发展的主要成就
    社会生产持续发展，经济实力进一步增强。据初步计算，１９８８年我国国民生产总值为１３６９４亿元，比上年增长１１．２％①；国民收入１１３３８亿元，比上年增长１１．４％。经济增长速度不仅明显高于西方发达国家，也高于发展中国家②，是世界上少数几个经济高速增长的国家之一。农村经济持续活跃。全年预计农村社会总产值达１１０００多亿元，比上年增长１０％以上。其中，农业总产值为５３００亿元，增长２％以上。除种植业下降外，林、牧、副、渔业均有不同程度增长。主要农产品中，粮、棉、油减产，其他大多数农产品增产，糖料扭转了连续两年下降的趋势，产量有较大回升，肉、禽、蛋、奶、水产品等，都有不同程度增产。
    工业有效供给增加。全年乡、镇以上企业的工业总产值突破１５０００亿元，比上年增长１７．７％；包括村及村以下工业，约增长２０％左右③。其中主要轻纺产品、能源、原材料、支农和出口产品比上年大都有不同程度增长。
    交通运输在紧运行中进一步发展。全年货物周转量２０００６亿吨公里，比上年增长４．７％；旅客周转量５６２３亿人公里，增长１１．４％；港口吞吐量４．３６亿吨，增长１０％。
    新投产一批建设项目，提高了生产能力。全年预计建成投产５万元以上基建项目４万个，完成更新改造项目４万多个。能源、交通、原材料工业建设中，都有一批骨干项目建成投产。基本建设新增发电机组容量９４４万千瓦，原油开采能力１５７６万吨，原煤开采能力３０９０万吨，沿海港口吞吐能力７４４万吨，铁路复线交付营业里程８３０公里，铁路电气化里程１４７０公里，１０种有色金属生产能力１２万吨，乙烯生产能力６０万吨。
    对外经济交流扩大。全年预计海关进出口总额达１０２９亿美元，比上年增长２４．４％。其中出口４７６亿美元，增长２０．８％；进口５５３亿美元，增长２８％。如果扣除无偿捐赠、来料加工、补偿贸易等，一般贸易逆差为２５亿美元④。全年非贸易顺差３６亿美元。利用外资有新进展，结构进一步趋向合理。预计全年实际利用外资８８亿美元，增长１６．２％。客商直接投资呈现新特点：一是独资企业兴起，二是台胞投资活跃，三是工业项目居多，四是出口创汇型项目增多。
    科技领域取得新突破。１９８８年国家批准的发明奖２１７项，科学技术进步奖５１５项。实用通信卫星准确定点赤道上空，潜射导弹发射成功，北京正负电子对撞机对撞成功，兰州重离子加速器建成出束，低纬度区第一次火箭探空试验圆满结束，说明我国科学技术，特别是在高科技领域有了新的突破。
    治理、整顿工作开始进行。１９８８年第四季度，各地开始贯彻实施中央“治理、整顿、调整、改革”的八字方针，截至１１月末，全国决定停缓建各类投资项目１０２２０个，可压缩今后投资３３４亿元。清理整顿了一批政企不分的公司，查处了一批“官倒”、“私倒”。由于开展保值储蓄、有奖储蓄等活动，使居民储蓄回升，四季度平均月储蓄净增额已基本恢复到正常水平。年末城乡居民储蓄存款余额达到３７９８亿元，比年初增加７２５亿元，增长２３．６％。
    　　　　国民经济发展中的主要问题
    社会供求总量不平衡进一步加剧。供需差额扩大。全年预计社会总需求比上年增长２２．１％；总供给比上年增长１９．３％。供需差率由上年的１３．６％扩大到１６．２％。在总需求中，消费需求增长率由上年的１４．７％猛升到２６．５％；其中，银行对城镇居民支付的工资及其他现金达３１７９亿元，比上年增长２６．５％。投资需求继续扩大。预计全年全社会固定资产投资将达４３００多亿元，超过计划控制指标１３００多亿元；在建项目总投资规模将超过１．３万亿元，其中全民单位突破１万亿元。商品货源与购买力之间的差额扩大。预计全年商品购买力在８７００亿元左右，比上年增长２７％，货源与购买力之间的差额达８００亿元左右，市场压力越来越大。货币超经济发行大量增加，银行信贷不平衡，存贷差扩大；货币发行大大突破计划。
    结构性矛盾更加突出。分配结构不合理，社会收入分配过于向个人倾斜。居民收入占国民生产总值的比重由１９８４年的５９．９％上升到１９８８年的６２．６％。而与此同时，居民的消费领域仍然比较窄，主要集中在吃、穿、用上，住、行和各种非商品消费比重过低，消费结构与生产结构不相适应，脱离国情的高消费倾向比较突出。社会集团消费增长过快。１９８８年社会集团购买的消费品总额达６６５亿元，比上年增长２０．３％，同计划压缩２０％相距甚远。
    产业结构不协调更加严重。一是工业的超高速增长与农业的低速增长，加剧了工农业之间不协调。全年工业与农业的增长速度比由上年的３∶１扩大到７∶１以上；工农业总产值中，农业所占比重由１９８４年的２９．７％下降到２５％左右，与农村改革前的１９７８年水平基本持平。二是工业内部结构出现两个不合理倾斜：企业结构上向乡村企业倾斜，工业生产中，乡村工业发展过快，全年乡办工业比上年增长３５％，村办工业增长更快，资源配置不合理更加突出；工业结构向加工工业倾斜，加工工业过快增长和能源、采掘、原材料工业生产相对滞后不相适应。全年工业总产值中，加工工业增长２３％，而采掘、原材料工业仅增长１０．８％。三是农业内部粮、棉、油等基础产品生产不稳，产量下降与人口增长加快不相适应，供求矛盾突出。１９８８年粮食总产量３．９４亿吨，比上年减产２．３％；棉花产量４０６万吨，减产４．３％；油料产量１２８５万吨，减产１５．９％。近三四年，粮棉油产量连年徘徊，而人口却加快增长，１９８８年人口自然增长率高达１５．７３‰，是１９７５年以来的最高峰，预计１９８９年三四月间全国人口将突破１１亿，农副产品供应压力越来越大。粮食由１９８５—１９８６年的净出口转为净进口，１９８７—１９８８年净进口粮食１６００多万吨，１９８８年末，粮食、棉花、食用植物油库存下降。四是国民经济高速发展与交通运输能力缓慢增长并行，运输紧张状况进一步加剧。
    市场波动，物价上涨幅度过大。商品销量激增，零售市场起伏大。全年社会商品零售总额达７４４０亿元，比上年增长２７．８％；扣除物价因素实际增长７．９％。分季看，一季度增长２３．１％，二季度增长２６．２％，三季度增长３４．６％，四季度增长２７．４％，各季之间波动幅度之大，是建国以来少有的。特别是抢购风连绵不断，进一步加大了市场压力。初步测算，全年商品零售总额增量中，由于抢购而引起的不正常销售约占２０％。商品紧缺面扩大，结构性矛盾和总量不足并存。多数商品花色品种不全。
    受需求过大和不少地方、单位攀比涨价等因素影响，预计全年零售物价总水平比上年上涨１８．５％，职工生活费用价格总指数上涨２０．７％，均为建国以来没有的。在消费品价格上涨的同时，生产资料价格也急剧上涨。１９８８年前三季度，物资部门１５种主要生产资料销售价格总指数比上年同期上升１８．５％，大大高于１９８７年同期上涨６．１％的水平。其中钢材上涨２０．９％，铜、铝上涨近４０％。由于物价上涨幅度大，加重了国家、企业、个人的负担。前１１个月，国家财政除了增发对职工的明补外，各种价格暗补仍达２７０亿元。居民增加的收入绝大部分让涨价“吃掉”了。物价的迅猛上涨不仅已形成重大的经济问题，而且还造成了严重的政治影响。
    流通领域经济秩序混乱。由于实行价格“双轨制”，在需求大于供给的经济环境下，流通领域利润较丰厚，社会掀起“经商热”，加之流通中缺乏明确的政策界限，出现了大量的“倒买倒卖”现象，中间盘剥较为突出，经济秩序严重混乱。
    　　　　展望与建议
    展望１９８９年，国民经济将在紧缩中运行，调整中前进。
    农业：生产可望回升，但完成计划目标难度大。１９８９年，各级政府将强化对农业生产建设的领导，农业配套服务可望加强，加上市场需求旺盛，价格上涨幅度大，对农民有一定刺激作用，如果没有大的自然灾害，生产可望有所回升。但是当前值得注意的是，由于比价不合理，棉农积极性不高，棉花主产区普遍出现不愿种棉花的倾向，如不采取有效措施，棉花生产有可能再次出现滑坡。生猪生产受粮价上涨、饲料价高物缺、收购资金紧缺、仔猪价格下跌等影响，农民发展养猪的积极性还不稳定。因此，对农业生产必须下大力量，采取比较实在的措施，稳定和完善发展农业的政策，进一步调动农民生产积极性，力争夺取好收成。
    工业：生产速度将有所回落，但不会出现大的滑坡。在紧运行的环境中，受资金、能源、原材料、交通以及砍投资、压需求等因素的制约，工业生产特别是重工业生产速度将有所抑制。但由于支撑工业生产的市场需求拉力、财政压力、承包动力犹在，估计生产仍将保持一个较高的速度，一季度在１０％以上，全年也不低于１０％。因此，有关部门必须把主要精力放在调整产业结构、产品结构、企业结构上，采取倾斜的政策，腾出一部分资金等生产要素，择优支持调整工作，通过有保有压的措施，把有效供给搞上去，把过高的速度降下来。
    投资：有所控制，但压下来难度较大。随着各地进一步贯彻国务院清理固定资产投资项目、压缩投资规模的通知，１９８９年预算内投资可望进一步压缩，但对预算外投资控制、疏导仍缺乏有效办法，真正把过大的投资规模压下来，难度仍然很大。与此同时，重点建设资金不足的矛盾将继续加剧。因此，在清理固定资产投资的同时，要制定必要的投资税政策，加强对预算外投资的疏导和管理，以真正做到在调整结构中压缩规模。而控制投资增长的重点则应放在严格审批新开工项目上，建立对新上项目的管理法规。
    市场：潜在的不稳定因素较多，涨价难以抑制。１９８９年稳定物价、稳定市场工作难度很大。一是１９８８年的遗留问题多，仅翘尾因素就将影响１９８９年物价总指数上升８％左右，超量发行的货币，有相当大的部分有待涨价消化。二是要新出台一些调价措施，且乱涨价、乱搭车现象仍可能发生。三是供需缺口仍难以弥补。四是消费者的等待观望、持币待购心理强烈，在当年结余购买力中，居民手存现金由１９８７年末的１８９亿元增加到１９８８年末的５４０多亿元，所占比重由１８．５％上升到４３．１％，极易引发市场波动，切不可掉以轻心。要加强对市场物价的管理，着重把粮、油、肉、糖、菜、盐、布等群众基本生活必需品和农业生产资料价格控制住，不允许随意乱涨价，尽量推迟出台涨价措施，实行小调整大稳定的方针，树立群众的信心，消除恐慌心理。特别是要采取多种方式，大力增加居民储蓄存款，提高信用回笼能力。对各种宣传工作也要加以改进，把困难如实告诉人民，取得人民的支持，共渡难关。
    ①国民生产总值、国民收入、工农业总产值、农村社会总产值绝对值按现价计算，增长速度按可比价格计算。
    ②１９８８年世界经济增长率为３．７％，发达国家为３．８％，发展中国家为３．６％，苏联、东欧国家为４％，亚洲“四小”接近１０％。
    ③村及村以下工业，根据有关调查资料，对“水分”已作了扣除。
    ④根据经贸部统计，１９８８年出口额４０１亿美元，比上年增长１５．５％；进口额３９３亿美元，增长１７．７％。顺差８亿美元。它和海关统计的差别主要是统计方法、口径不同。此外，经贸部系统外的进出口统计也有遗漏。
