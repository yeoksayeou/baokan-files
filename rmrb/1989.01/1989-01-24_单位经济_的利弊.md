Title: The Pros and Cons of "Unit Economics"

The term "unit economics" probably does not appear in any economics textbook. The author takes the risk of coining this new term because of the increasing phenomenon of various "units" distributing or selling "year-end goods" at discounted prices at the end of the year.

Under the macroeconomic conditions of rectification and economic adjustment, the practice of government agencies and enterprises openly spending public funds for the New Year has been curbed. However, according to the author's personal experience and observations, various types and sizes of "units" using legal means to provide some discounted year-end goods for their employees has almost become a "routine." In cities, if a household has two or three people working in units (including retired personnel), their homes are likely filled with various forms of "cold storage" stocked with poultry and meat. This is probably not an isolated phenomenon.

The author has no intention of criticizing "units" for using legitimate means to provide benefits for their employees. At the very least, it can reduce the labor of employees shopping in the market and alleviate some of the pain caused by price increases and actual income reductions. For society, it also helps to ease market pressure. These benefits cannot be ignored.

Moreover, this phenomenon also indicates that, despite a slight decrease in grain and oil production last year, our food supply is much richer than before. Imagine, during the difficult period of 1959-1961, even if a "unit" tried its best, it could probably not have obtained even a fraction of the "year-end goods" that can be provided today.

However, it is worth studying why, in a situation where the market is generally in short supply, so many products do not flow into the market but instead flow into "units"? Why do they not enter the hands of consumers through market channels but through the channels of "unit economics"? This involves the issue of how "units" compete with the market for products.

Here, we will not discuss the "backdoor" methods, but only the generally accepted legal means. The more common ones are:

A "unit" allocates a sum of money to invest in a nearby village. In return, the village provides the "unit" with a fixed quantity of agricultural and sideline products at a fixed price for several years (essentially transferring the cost of using the unit's funds—interest—into employee consumption).

A "unit" uses its own transportation to purchase and transport agricultural and sideline products directly from the source at local prices to sell to employees, with transportation and management costs included in the "unit's" production costs or administrative and operational expenses.

"Units" form partnerships, providing each other with various "preferential" conditions (goods or other "conveniences") that are converted into employee benefits.

And so on.

There is a common point here: converting part of the "unit's" production costs (for enterprises) or administrative and operational expenses (for government agencies) into personal consumption for employees outside of their wages and bonuses. This "converted" portion may not be a large part of the "unit's" expenditures, but if someone could conduct a statistical analysis of the entire society, the total amount might be quite significant. Moreover, this might be another fund used for personal consumption outside of the "resident income as a percentage of GDP, which increased from 59.9% in 1984 to 62.6% in 1988" as reported by the National Bureau of Statistics. This means that the more "developed" the "unit economics," the larger the amount of money used for personal consumption in society compared to the official statistics, and the smaller the amount of money used for production and operational expenses compared to the official statistics. This also means that the contradiction between total demand exceeding total supply is more severe than what we see in the statistical tables. Ultimately, this is not beneficial to consumers themselves, although it may not be easily felt in the short term.

If the market mechanism were more mature, the products that flow into consumers through "unit economics" should enter the market, allowing the market to provide consumers with more reasonable prices and better services (the current method of distribution by head count is prone to waste and lacks consumer choice). The benefits that "units" provide to employees should be more directly reflected in employees' wages and bonuses, or supplemented by subsidies to address some of the special needs and difficulties of employees, rather than adopting the method of transferring production and operational expenses into personal consumption for employees. It is also not necessary for "units" to purchase general commodities that should be supplied by the market. Originally, "unit economics" was a supplementary measure for an underdeveloped market, but from this perspective, it can also become an opposing force to market development, which is something people may not easily notice.

However, "units" themselves cannot solve this problem. "Unit" leaders directly feel the dual pressure from employees and neighbors, "What are other units distributing (selling) and what is our unit doing?" This kind of talk often forces "unit" leaders to rack their brains to seek the "development" of "unit economics."

From an overall perspective, in the context of the gradual formation of a healthy market, "unit economics" has both advantages and disadvantages and cannot be solved with a "one-size-fits-all" approach. However, to avoid exacerbating long-term, overall issues for the sake of short-term, local benefits, and to gradually reduce the latter to the lowest possible level, effective macro-control measures and further market development are needed.

Under the conditions of the coexistence of old and new systems, economic life is full of such phenomena where "micro-level gains, macro-level concerns." It is worth considering for those in charge of economic leadership, as well as for consumers. Different social groups understanding each other's situations can gradually improve society's psychological tolerance for reform.

### “单位经济”的利弊

　　“单位经济”的利弊
    叶稼
    “单位经济”这个名词恐怕在任何一本经济学著作中都没有出现过。笔者甘冒杜撰新名词的“风险”而用出这个词，是有感于岁尾年头各个“单位”发放或以优惠价出售“年货”的现象有增无减而发。
    在治理、整顿经济的“大气候”下，党政机关、企事业单位明目张胆地“公费过年”的做法受到遏制，但据笔者亲身经历或耳闻目睹之所及，各种类型、大大小小的“单位”用合法的手段为本单位职工办一点多少带有优惠价的年货，几乎成为一种“常规”。城市中一户如有两、三个人在工作单位（包括已离退休的），家里各种形式的“冷库”挂满或塞满鸡鸭鱼肉的，恐怕不是个别现象。
    笔者毫无指责“单位”用正当手段为职工谋福利之意。它至少可以减少职工上街购物之劳，冲淡一点因物价上涨而实际收入下降之苦，对社会来说，也有助于减轻市场压力。这些好处都不能抹煞。
    而且，这种现象也表明，尽管去年粮油有所减产，我们的食品还是比过去丰富多了。试想，在１９５９—１９６１年的困难时期，“单位”即使想尽办法，恐怕也搞不到今天所能提供“年货”的几分之一吧？
    但是，值得研究的是，在市场总的还是供不应求的情况下，为什么有这么多的产品不流向市场而流向“单位”？不通过市场渠道而通过“单位经济”的渠道进入消费者手中？这就涉及“单位”怎样与市场“争夺”产品的问题。
    这里不谈那些“邪门歪道”，只讲一般被认为正当的手段，比较常见的有：
    “单位”拿出一笔钱，向附近的某农村“投资”。作为回报，某农村以固定价格向“单位”提供定量的农副产品，一定几年不变（实际是把利用单位资金的费用——利息转为职工消费）。
    “单位”用自备的交通工具，直接从产地以当地价格购运农副产品售给职工，运输和管理费用进入“单位”成本或行政、事业费。
    “单位”之间挂钩，相互提供各自手中的“优惠”条件（实物或其它“方便”），转为职工福利。
    如此等等。
    这里有一个共同点，就是把“单位”的生产费用（指企业）或行政、事业费用（指机关）中的一部分“转化”为职工工资奖金以外的个人消费。这个“转化”的部分在本“单位”开支中所占比例不大，但如果有人能对全社会作个统计的话，总数也可能是相当可观的。而且这可能是在国家统计局公布的“居民收入占国民生产总值的比重由１９８４年的５９．９％上升到１９８８年的６２．６％”之外的又一笔用于个人消费的基金。这意味着，“单位经济”越“发达”，全社会用于个人消费的金额就比正式统计数字更大，直接用于生产和业务费用的金额就比正式统计数字更小，这也意味着总需求超过总供给的矛盾比我们从统计表上看到的更加严重。归根到底，这也不利于消费者自己，只是一时不易感觉到而已。
    如果市场机制发育更健全，通过“单位经济”流入消费者的产品本应进入市场，使市场可能以更合理的价格和较好的服务使消费者得益（现在这种按人头“分”的办法，既容易造成浪费，人们又缺少选择余地），而“单位”给职工的报酬和福利应该更多直接体现于职工工资、奖金的货币收入，或加上为解决职工一些特殊需要和困难所作的补贴，而不应采取把生产和业务费用“转移”为职工个人消费的办法，也不必为职工采购本应由市场供应的一般商品。本来作为市场不发达的补充手段的“单位经济”，从这一面看又会成为阻碍市场发育的对立物，这也是人们一时不易感觉出来的。
    但是，“单位”自身是解决不了这个问题的。“单位”负责人直接感受到来自职工和左邻右舍的双重压力，“人家都在发（卖）什么什么了，咱单位领导干什么去了？”这类议论常常迫使“单位”领导挖空心思谋求“单位经济”的“发展”。
    从总体上看，在健全市场的形成不能一蹴而就的情况下，“单位经济”也是有利有弊的，不宜也不可能用“一刀切”的办法来解决。但要避免因眼前、局部之利而加剧长远、整体之弊，并把后者逐步压缩到可能的最低限度，则有赖于得力的宏观调控措施和市场的进一步发育。
    在新旧体制并存条件下，经济生活中这类“微观是喜、宏观有忧”的现象比比皆是。既值得担当经济领导工作的人去思考，也值得消费者去思考。不同的社会群体互相理解对方处境，社会对改革的心理承受能力有可能逐步提高。
