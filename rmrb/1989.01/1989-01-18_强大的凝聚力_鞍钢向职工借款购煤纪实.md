From December 19 to 25, 1988, the office of the Industrial and Commercial Bank of China in Anshan City, Anshan Iron and Steel Group (Anshan Steel), was piled high with stacks of cash. Despite the efforts of all the staff working overtime, including borrowing modern coin-counting machines from the neighboring Anshan Jinshang Trust and Investment Company, they could barely keep up.

20,343,865 yuan! Each bill, from the largest denominations of 100 yuan, 50 yuan, and 10 yuan, down to the smallest coins of 5 fen, 2 fen, and 1 fen, reflected the radiant spirit of the enterprise's owners!

In the nearly 40-year history of Anshan Steel, everyone who has been devoted to this land will never forget these brief days...

	The General Manager Bows Deeply

When the plow of reform had tilled the land of the descendants of the dragon for the tenth spring, the impact of economic overheating and inflation caused Anshan Steel, which had always been "wealthy and arrogant," to start facing difficulties from the third quarter of 1988. By the fourth quarter, especially as the year-end approached, the situation became even more dire.

At this time, General Manager Li Huazhong was more aware than anyone else of the severity of the problem.

After thorough communication and obtaining support from the company's party, political, and trade union leaders, Li Huazhong convened a meeting at 3 PM on December 19 in the Science and Technology Hall, gathering the heads of various units.

"Comrades, my feelings today are indeed difficult to express in words." Li Huazhong was highly emotional. He reported in detail to the attending leaders at all levels about the temporary difficulties facing Anshan Steel and the reasons for borrowing money from the workers.

"The company emphasizes that this borrowing of money from workers to pay for coal is voluntary. Workers can decide whether to lend or not to lend, and how much to lend, based on their own economic situation. Any unit that engages in mandatory allocation will be severely investigated by the company.

"This time, the company borrows money from workers as a temporary emergency measure. The borrowed funds will be raised within this week, and the company guarantees to repay them within two months..."

Finally, Li Huazhong bowed deeply to everyone!

	The Masters' Deep Affection

"General Manager Li Huazhong asking workers for money is not easy; he even bowed deeply to us. People's hearts are made of flesh and blood. We help the general manager solve temporary difficulties, which is also helping the enterprise and the country." Economic planner Qin Wande, 58, from the Computer Control Department, handed over more than ten thousand yuan he had prepared to buy a house, saying, "His words accurately reflect the sentiments of the vast majority of Anshan Steel workers at this moment."

Thus, the news that "the general manager is borrowing money from us" spread rapidly.

Old comrades familiar with Anshan Steel's history will certainly remember the long, harsh winter of 1948. Led by the old hero Meng Tai, the Anshan Steel workers, who had just become masters, pulled, carried, and transported large batches of materials to the recovering Anshan Steel amidst the thunderous sounds of victory in the War of Liberation. They collected a total of 210,000 items of various materials, playing a crucial role in the "July 9" start-up.

Now, 40 years have passed. But this majestic long shot is still developing in the historical negatives, passed down from generation to generation. This time, contributing all their savings to help Anshan Steel pay for coal is a vivid and concentrated embodiment of this spirit—

"The factory prospers, and we prosper; the factory declines, and we decline." Three years ago, Shihong, a young worker from the Electrical Repair Factory, was the first to advocate this slogan with a distinctive era character. He blushingly took out 200 yuan, but who knew that he, with a relatively low income, had a wife working in a long-loss-making local enterprise that sometimes couldn't even pay wages, and she also spent a lot on treating lymph node tuberculosis. This 200 yuan was indeed a heart devoted to the enterprise's rise and fall! A young worker from the Second Steelmaking Plant, Su Hongtao, only lent the company 20 yuan, a pitifully small amount. But it was sincerely offered, and the workshop leader accepted it with a warm heart. Everyone around knew! His beloved only child suffered from leukemia, a disease that modern medicine had not yet conquered. Even if he didn't contribute a penny, it would be enough to evoke sympathy. But he insisted, "Even if the melon is not full, it is a heart of benevolence! Please accept our little token of affection." The red-rimmed eyes seemed to be narrating the sentiments of a master of the enterprise.

Engineer Qiu Jian, a 66-year-old senior engineer retained by the Mechanical Manufacturing Company's Decision-Making Research Office, had lost his wife a few years ago. Introduced by others, he had already chosen his beloved and set the wedding date, which also required some preparation! However, when he heard the leadership's mobilization, he resolutely took out the 1,000 yuan he had saved. Especially the performance of the leaders of various units, the vast number of Communist Party members, and the Young Pioneers was even more brilliant: the leadership team of the First Steelmaking Plant averaged 1,000 yuan per person; the Supply and Marketing Company's 1,100 party members collectively raised 173,900 yuan, averaging 158 yuan per person; retired cadres Xu Dehou and old Red Army soldier Zhang Xianghua, using crutches, each handed over 5,000 yuan and 3,000 yuan of savings to their original units; Anshan Steel's Young Pioneer Wang Fengxia even donated the 2,000 yuan she had prepared for her dowry...

	"Outsiders" Send Timely Aid

The news of Anshan Steel borrowing money from workers to buy coal not only moved the hearts of Anshan Steel people but also attracted the great attention of related sister units, who promptly extended a helping hand of friendship.

Anshan Wire Rod Stock Company. On the morning of the 20th, just after starting work, Senior Engineer Yu Haichuan from the Shenyang Institute of Automation, Chinese Academy of Sciences, rushed into the office of Manager Li Chengyin, saying excitedly, "I heard that Anshan Steel is borrowing money from workers. We eight people elected me to represent everyone, each contributing 200 yuan. Although this amount of money may not help much, it is our token of affection, please accept it."

Anshan Dongshan Hotel. On the evening of the 20th, Manager Gao Yufu, a senior engineer from the Second Department of the Second Institute of the Aviation Industry Ministry, who was in Anshan on business, was discussing the wording of a letter with his colleagues Sun Zhanmin and Ma Jin under the lamp. The letter read: "We came to Anshan on business and learned of your company's coal shortage. We feel that this is not only a big deal for Anshan Steel but also a big deal for China's steel industry. Therefore, we only keep 300 yuan..." However, what a 300 yuan it was! It was the amount they saved by changing from taking a plane to a hard seat on a train.

Shashi Steel Pipe Factory in Hubei learned of the situation and proactively called, expressing their willingness to lend 100 to 300 million yuan;

...

In the days when Anshan Steel faced temporary difficulties, the support from all directions gave Anshan Steel people encouragement far more precious than money.

A brief week passed in the blink of an eye. However, this soul-stirring week, this week of unity and interdependence with the enterprise, has written a brilliant page in the history of Anshan Steel.

　　强大的凝聚力
    ——鞍钢向职工借款购煤纪实
    １９８８年１２月１９日至２５日。
    中国工商银行鞍山市分行驻鞍钢办事处里，堆满了山也似的钞票。尽管全体工作人员挑灯夜战，甚至把毗邻的鞍山金钢信托公司现代化的点钞机挪借过来，仍然难以应付。
    ２０３４３８６５元！那一张张大至一百圆、伍拾圆、拾圆的面额，小到一枚枚伍分、贰分、壹分的硬币，折射着企业主人一缕缕照人的风采！
    在鞍钢开工将近４０年的历史上，所有痴情于这块热土的人，都不会忘记这一段短短的时日……
    　　　　总经理深鞠一躬
    当改革之犁，在龙的传人的故土上耕耘了第十个春秋的时候，受经济过热、通货膨胀的影响，一向“财大气粗”的鞍钢，自１９８８年第三季度起，不得不开始艰难度日。到了第四季度，特别是年关将近时，情况就更加严峻。
    此时，总经理李华忠比谁都清楚问题的严重性。
    于是，李华忠在和公司政党工团领导同志作了充分的沟通并取得支持之后，于１２月１９日下午３时，把各单位的头儿们召集到科技馆大厅。
    “同志们，我今天的心情，确实是难以用语言所表达的。”李华忠处于高度激动之中。他原原本本地向到场的各级领导同志报告了鞍钢所面临的暂时困难，以及为什么要向职工借款的缘由。
    “公司强调，这次向职工借钱支付购煤款，自觉自愿。职工可根据自己的经济情况，决定借或不借，借多借少。绝不允许任何单位搞硬性摊派。否则，公司将严肃查处有关负责人。
    “公司这次向职工借款属临时性应急措施，所借款在本周内筹齐，公司保证在两个月内偿还”……
    末了，李华忠向大家深深地鞠了一躬！
    　　　　主人翁情深似海
    “李华忠总经理向职工借钱，这个口张得不容易，还给大家深深地鞠了一躬。人心都是肉长的。我们帮助总经理解决暂时困难，也就是帮助了企业，帮助了国家。”计控处５８岁的经济师秦万德一边交上自己准备买房的上万元现金，一边说。他的话，相当准确地表达了鞍钢广大职工此时的心境。
    所以，很快，“总经理向咱们借钱啦”的消息不胫而走。
    熟悉鞍钢历史的老同志当然不会忘记，１９４８年那个难熬的漫长冬日。以老英雄孟泰为代表的刚刚翻身作了主人的鞍钢工人阶级，在解放战争取得节节胜利的隆隆炮声中，人拉、肩挑、车运，把大批器材交给恢复中的鞍钢，共汇集各种器材２１万件，对“七·九”开工发挥了重要作用。
    如今，４０年过去了。但这威武雄壮的长镜头，仍在历史的底片里显影，一代代弘扬光大。这次倾囊资助鞍钢支付购煤款，便是一次最集中的生动写照——
    “厂兴我富，厂衰我贫。”三年前万言上书厂领导、最先叫响这一具有时代特征的主人强音的电修厂青年工人石峰，只红着脸拿出２００元，谁晓得，本来就收入不高的他，爱人所在单位曾是长期亏损的地方企业，有时连工资都开不出来，而且她又因患淋巴结核病花费了不少。这２００元，他献上的委实是一颗情系企业兴衰的心啊！第二炼钢厂青年工人苏洪涛仅借给公司２０元，数额可谓少得可怜。但他是饱蘸赤诚拿出来的，所在车间领导是心头一热收下的。周围的同志谁不清楚！他心爱的独生子患了当代医疗技术尚未攻克的白血病，即使他一分钱不交也够让人同情的了。但他偏不！“瓜子不饱是仁（人）心！请收下咱的一点心意吧。”那发红的眼圈，似乎在娓娓述说着一位企业主人的情怀。
    机械制造公司经营决策研究室留用的高级工程师邱鉴，已是６６岁的老人了。老伴前几年去世。经人介绍，已选定意中人并择定了婚期喜日，多少也得有点准备呀！但是，当他听了领导的动员，便毅然把积攒的１０００元连窝端了出来。尤其是各单位领导干部、广大共产党员、共青团员的表现，更为光彩照人：第一炼钢厂领导班子，每人平均借资１０００元；供销公司１１００名党员共集资１７．３９万元，人均１５８元；离休干部徐德厚、老红军张乡华，是拄着拐杖分别把５０００元、３０００元积蓄送交原所在单位的；鞍钢机关共青团员王凤霞连准备置办嫁妆的２０００元也奉献了出来……
    　　　　“局外人”雪中送炭
    鞍钢向职工借购煤款的信息，不仅牵动着鞍钢人的情肠，也引起了有关兄弟单位的极大关注，及时伸出了援助的友谊之手。
    鞍钢线材股份有限公司。２０日早上刚上班，中国科学院沈阳自动化研究所高级工程师于海川便闯进了该公司经理李成印的办公室，急火火地说：“听说鞍钢向职工借资，我们８个人推举我代表大伙各出资２００元，这点钱虽说帮不了什么大忙，但作为大家的心意，务请收下。”
    鞍钢东山宾馆。２０日晚，航空航天工业部二院二部防范系统部来鞍出差的经理、高级工程师高玉前，正和同行的孙占民、马金在灯下切磋一封信的措词，上面写道：“我们公出来鞍办事，得知贵公司缺煤款的消息，感到这不仅是鞍钢的大事，更是关系到我国钢铁事业的大事。因此，我们仅留下３００元……”然而，这是怎样的３００元啊！是他们由原定坐飞机改乘火车硬座才挤出来的。
    湖北沙市钢管厂得知这个情况，主动打来电话，表示借款１００至３００万元；
    ……
    在鞍钢遇到暂时困难的日子里，来自四面八方的支援，所给予鞍钢人的鼓舞，比金钱不知要宝贵多少倍。
    短暂的一周时间弹指而过。然而，这震撼人们灵魂的一周，这万众一心同企业唇齿相依的一周，却在鞍钢的历史上写下了光彩夺目的一页。
