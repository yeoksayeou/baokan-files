In impoverished and backward old, minority, and border regions, promoting quality childbearing and upbringing is a particularly challenging task for many family planning departments. However, Longsheng County, an autonomous county for various ethnic minorities in Guangxi, has successfully incorporated the state's policy into the hearts of every mountain dweller through the medium of folk songs sung in every village and hamlet.

Longsheng County, home to the Zhuang, Yao, Miao, Dong, and Han ethnic groups, has a variety of unique ethnic festivals almost every month. Folk songs performed by singers from various ethnic groups, such as blowing wood leaves, pipa songs, caitiao, and fishing drums, are highly popular among the masses. Traditionally, the main themes of folk songs have been to celebrate "early ascent to the dragon gate," "early birth of dragon children," and "the more children, the more blessings."

County leaders and secretaries have taken the lead in utilizing folk songs. When they return to their hometowns, they sing new mountain songs that promote family planning. "The mountains are sparse, the fields are few, and the fields are sparse. If every family adds children recklessly, future generations will even fight over mud."

Now, Longsheng County has more than a thousand farmer-singers who, through their performances in villages and towns, sing praises of quality childbearing and upbringing, achieving what government departments find difficult to accomplish.

They use the languages of their own ethnic groups and forms that the masses find enjoyable to propagate the principles of family planning.

There is a popular folk song that goes: "Blow the wood leaves and sing songs, wealth does not come from having many children. The more stars in the sky, the less bright they are. A single full moon illuminates the mountains and rivers."

　　吹起木叶唱起歌　致富莫靠生孩多
    广西龙胜歌手宣传计划生育
    据新华社南宁１月１９日电  （记者杜新）在贫困落后的老、少、边地区推行优生优育，是许多计划生育部门最棘手的难题。而广西龙胜各族自治县却在村村寨寨的山歌声中，将国家的这一政策注入到每一个山民的心里。
    聚居着壮、瑶、苗、侗、汉等民族的龙胜县，几乎月月有风情各异的民族节日。各族歌手演唱的吹木叶、琵琶歌、彩调、渔鼓等大受群众欢迎。以往，颂贺“早登龙门”、“早得龙子”、“多子多福”是传统民歌中的主要内容之一。
    县长、书记们率先利用起民歌，他们回到家乡时，唱起了宣传计划生育的新山歌。“山林少，田也少来山场少，假如家家猛添丁，后世吃泥也要争。”
    现在，龙胜县有上千名农民歌手在走村串户的演唱中夸唱优生优育，起着政府部门难以起到的作用。
    他们用本民族的语言，群众喜闻乐见的形式，宣传计划生育的道理。
    有一支颇受欢迎的山歌，这样唱道：“吹起木叶唱起歌，致富莫靠生孩多，天上星多亮不远，一轮明月照山河。”
