Song Ping, a member of the Political Bureau of the CPC Central Committee and Minister of the Central Organization Department, held a discussion with the students of the fifth session of the provincial and ministerial-level cadre study class who are about to graduate. The topics were "What is your opinion on the current quality of various levels of party and government leaders?" and "What suggestions and requirements do you have for improving the quality of various levels of party and government leaders?"

After carefully listening to the students' speeches, Song Ping shared his own views.

Song Ping said that currently, the entire country is undergoing political and economic system reforms, which is a new endeavor with no precedents. So far, our reforms have achieved significant results, but we have also encountered some temporary difficulties, mainly economic overheating leading to inflation. In this situation, people's thoughts have become somewhat confused: Is the direction of reform correct? Should we continue with the reform? Some even say that the Communist Party cannot lead the Four Modernizations. Our party has undergone the test of storms and has rich experience in overcoming various difficulties. Decades of history have proven that our party is a good party. Although there are many problems now and the party's prestige has been damaged, as long as the party is determined to grasp and persist in grasping, the party's combat effectiveness can be enhanced, and the existing problems can be solved. The history of the Chinese revolution has proven that no matter what we do, no matter how great the difficulties, as long as the party organization takes it seriously; as long as party members take the lead and play a pioneering and exemplary role, problems can be solved. We must seriously grasp the construction of the party and build a stronger and more solid party.

When discussing the quality of various levels of party and government leading cadres, Song Ping said that currently, a large proportion of those who joined the party in the 1970s and 1980s are young and vigorous, with relatively high scientific and cultural levels, and are also rich in pioneering and innovative spirit. However, they lack basic theoretical knowledge of Marxism-Leninism and practical work experience. We must invest a lot of effort in arming cadres and party members with basic Marxist theory. Members of various levels of leading cadres should further improve their Marxist-Leninist theoretical level on the basis of their current level. This is a fundamental requirement for improving the quality of party and government cadres. In the future, we should establish a system where all those who enter the party and government leading cadres must study the basic theory of Marxism at the party school; those who have already entered the leading cadres should also undergo short-term study in batches to make up for this lesson. Without basic Marxist-Leninist knowledge, it is difficult to undertake party and government leadership work.

Song Ping also mentioned that some young comrades in various levels of leading cadres are not familiar with the party's fine traditions and the party's three major styles. Young comrades should strengthen their learning in this area and carry forward the glorious traditions and fine styles formed by our party in the long-term revolutionary struggle.

Song Ping finally said that we must strengthen the construction of the party in the process of reform and opening up. At the same time, the party's own construction must also be reformed. We must absorb new things, study new situations, summarize new experiences, and answer new questions; we must dare to resist and criticize erroneous things and not be carried away by the tide or be weak and powerless.

　　宋平在省部级干部读书班学员座谈会上说
    各级干部要用马克思主义武装
    党的建设要在改革开放中改革
    本报北京１月１２日讯  记者尹品端报道：“你对当前各级党政领导干部素质状况的看法”，“你对提高各级党政领导干部素质有何建议和要求”。这是今天上午中共中央政治局委员、中央组织部部长宋平，与即将结业的第５期省部级领导干部读书班学员座谈时所出的题目。宋平在认真听取了学员们的发言之后，也发表了自己的意见。
    宋平同志说，现在全国都在进行政治、经济的体制改革，这是没有经验可循的新的事业。现在，我们的改革取得了很大成绩，但在前进中也遇到了一些暂时的困难，主要是经济过热，带来通货膨胀。在这种情况下，人们的思想产生了一些混乱：改革方向对不对？改革还要不要坚持下去，还有人说“共产党领导不了四化事业”等等。我们的党是经历过大风大浪考验的党，有着战胜各种困难的丰富经验。几十年历史证明，我们的党是一个好党。尽管现在问题不少，党的威信受到损害，但只要党下决心抓，坚持抓，党的战斗力就能提高，存在的问题就能够解决。中国革命的历史证明，无论办什么事，有多么大的困难，只要党的组织认真抓；只要党员带头，发挥先锋模范作用，问题都可以得到解决。我们要认真抓好党的建设，把党建设得更好、更坚强。
    在谈到各级党政领导班子的素质时，宋平同志说，现在七八十年代入党的同志占了很大的比例，这些同志年富力强，有较高科学、文化水平，也富有开拓创新的精神，不足之处是马列主义基本理论知识和实际工作的锻炼比较缺乏。我们要花大力量用马克思主义基本理论武装干部，武装党员。各级领导班子成员在现有基础上进一步提高马列主义理论水平。这是提高党政干部素质的一个根本要求。今后要形成一个制度，凡进入党政领导班子的同志，都要在党校学习马克思主义的基本理论；已进入领导班子的，也要分期分批地进行短期学习，补上这一课。没有基本的马列主义知识，是难于胜任党政领导工作的。
    宋平同志还提到，在各级领导班子中的一些年轻同志，对党的优良传统、对党的三大作风不熟悉。年青同志要加强这方面的学习，把我们党在长期革命斗争中形成的光荣传统和优良作风，继承下来，发扬光大。
    宋平同志最后说，我们要在改革、开放中加强党的建设，与此同时，党的自身建设也要进行改革。要吸收新东西，研究新情况，总结新经验，回答新问题；对一些错误的东西，要敢于抵制，敢于批评，不能随波逐流，不能软弱无力。
