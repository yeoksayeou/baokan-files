Sculpture is an art form, a three-dimensional entity meant for appreciation. From this perspective, urban sculpture is similar to salon sculpture, but the functions of urban sculpture differ from those of salon sculpture.

Generally speaking, salon sculpture emphasizes the artistic views of the "self" or the people in the salon, and belongs to indoor sculpture. Once urban sculpture is established, it stands permanently in a fixed location. Whether it is day or night, or any season, it welcomes all viewers equally and enthusiastically, regardless of their profession, age, ethnicity, or race. It belongs to humanity, the nation, and the public, rather than to an individual. Therefore, some countries classify it as "public sculpture." Its influence on people's thoughts is broad and profound.

The cultural tourism area in the United States, featuring the likenesses of Presidents Washington, Jackson, Lincoln, and Roosevelt, attracts over 2 million visitors annually. It strengthens the patriotic and democratic consciousness of the nation's viewers, while foreign visitors consider it a tourist destination. The Statue of Liberty in New York Harbor, the Soviet War Memorial, the relief sculptures on the Arc de Triomphe in Paris, and the sculpture of the "Mermaid of Warsaw" in Poland all similarly function like the Mountain of Portraits. The relief sculptures on the Monument to the People's Heroes in Beijing record the heroic deeds of the Chinese people in their struggle for freedom and independence since 1840. This monument, overseen by the architect Liang Sicheng and constructed from gray granite, is a complete, stable, and solemn memorial building. It features ten frames at the base, making each piece of Han white marble relief sculpture appear as an independent painting. Each relief sculpture combines and condenses the different contents of a historical period, producing an effect similar to a television series. It creates a history of the people's heroes written in stone. It has a broad and long-term influence on society and the nation. The noble deeds of the people's heroes guide the youth in their growth towards noble thinking, and it also serves as a place where leaders from various countries express their friendship and respect towards China.

Since the founding of the nation, the sculpture industry in China has achieved tremendous development. Art academies and other educational institutions have trained a large number of sculptors with a solid foundation and creative abilities. The people's sculpture art emerged after the founding of the nation, nurtured and cherished by the people, becoming an important part of the art industry.

In the past, Chinese people had to go abroad to study to become successful, but there were no foreign students coming to China to study sculpture. Now, it is common for foreigners to come to China to study or pursue a master's degree in sculpture, and they have achieved results. In the past, foreign sculpture experts taught sculpture techniques in China. After the Gang of Four was smashed, Chinese sculptors trained in China were hired to teach abroad. Some countries' presidents even designated Chinese sculptors to create urban sculptures for their capitals. Chinese urban sculptures have appeared in Asia, Africa, and Europe and are now spreading throughout the world.

Since the founding of the nation, especially after 1982, Chinese urban sculpture has been revitalized, although there are many shortcomings and weaknesses. However, many good and relatively good works have emerged. The works are gradually becoming diverse, and the themes are becoming richer. Some have been widely introduced abroad and have become familiar and loved by people around the world. Chinese urban sculpture has seen a breakthrough in development. Works by Chinese sculptors trained in China have won multiple international competitions. Chinese sculpture has entered the world. Chinese urban sculpture is advancing.

　　中国城市雕塑在前进
    傅天仇
    雕塑是美术，是供欣赏的三度空间的实体。从这个角度看，城市雕塑和沙龙雕塑是相同的，但城市雕塑的职能与沙龙雕塑有所区别。
    一般说来，沙龙雕塑特别强调只有“自我”或沙龙中人的艺术观点，属室内雕塑。而城市雕塑一经建立就长期屹立在一个固定的地方，无论是昼夜、四季，它都不分职业、年龄、民族和人种等，对观者都平等地热情地接待。它属于人类、国家和公众的而不是属于私人的。因而有的国家把它列为“公众雕塑”。它对人们的思想影响的广度和潜移默化的深度都有极重要作用。
    以华盛顿、杰克逊、林肯、罗斯福四位总统形象构成美国肖像之山的文化旅游区，每年接待２００多万以上的观众，它增强了这个国家观众的爱国和民主的意识，而外国观众则以此为旅游胜地。纽约港的自由女神像，苏联卫国战争纪念碑和巴黎凯旋门上的浮雕以及波兰《华沙美人鱼》的雕塑，无不以其艺术的魅力起着和肖像雕塑之山类似的功能。北京人民英雄纪念碑上的浮雕，记载着从１８４０年以来中国人民争取自由、独立的可歌可泣的事迹。这座由建筑大师梁思成主持的，以灰色花岗石构成碑身的建筑体，成为一座完整、稳定而又庄严的纪念性建筑。它在须弥座位置上安排十个画框，使每片汉白玉浮雕成为独立的画幅出现。每处浮雕都综合和浓缩了一个历史阶段的不同内容，产生类似电视连续剧的作用，制作出由石头写成的人民英雄历史。它对社会，国家有着广泛而长期的影响。人民英雄的美好行为，引导着青少年在高尚的思维中成长，同时，它也成为世界各国领袖向中国表示友谊和敬意的场所。
    建国以来，中国雕塑事业取得了巨大发展。以美术院校为主的教育机构，培养了一大批雕塑基础好并有创造能力的雕塑家，人民的雕塑艺术在建国后破土而出，它受到人民的培养和爱护，成为美术事业的重要部分。
    过去中国人只有去外国学才能成才，却没有外国学生来中国学习雕塑的。现在外国来中国留学，或者作为研究生来中国学习雕塑已是常事，并取得了成绩。过去是外国雕塑专家在中国传授雕塑技艺，粉碎“四人帮”以后，中国自己培养的雕塑家受聘到国外教学；有的国家总统还指定要请中国雕塑家给他们的首都做城市雕塑。中国的城市雕塑已在亚洲、非洲、欧洲出现，并已走向世界。
    建国后，尤其１９８２年以后，中国城市雕塑在振兴，虽然存在不少缺点和弱点，但是，也有不少好的和比较好的作品问世。作品逐渐形成多样，题材渐渐丰富，有的已为外国广泛介绍，成为全世界所熟悉和喜爱，中国城市雕塑出现了突破性的发展。中国自己培养的雕塑家的雕塑作品在国际竞赛中挂冠的已有多起。中国雕塑已进入世界。中国城雕在前进。
