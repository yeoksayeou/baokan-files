Both "Run to the Port" and "Run to the Fields"
Jiangsu Sends Over a Thousand Officials to the Northern Grain-Producing Regions

A Xinhua News Agency report by Zhou Zhenfeng: "Agriculture must advance, and the government must serve." Jiangsu Province has selected 1,600 government officials to be stationed in key grain-producing areas in northern Jiangsu, including the cities of Xuzhou, Huaiyin, Yancheng, Yangzhou, and Lianyungang, where they will serve as part-time officials in townships. Their mission is to assist in the development of grain production. This is a measure taken by the Provincial Party Committee and the Provincial Government to strengthen leadership in agricultural production, serve agriculture and farmers, and ensure a bumper grain harvest next year.

Xuzhou, Huaiyin, Yancheng, Yangzhou, and Lianyungang are major grain-producing areas in Jiangsu and are key suppliers of commercial grain. In recent years, county and township leaders in these areas have also been more focused on running to cities to link up with industrial projects, rather than going to the countryside to focus on grain production. Consequently, they have not been able to fully address and solve the actual difficulties faced by agriculture and farmers. The leadership in agriculture has relatively weakened. According to the spirit of the National Rural Work Conference, the Jiangsu Provincial Party Committee and the Provincial Government believe: agriculture must be highly valued and vigorously developed. County and township leaders must focus on both industry and agriculture. They must not only "run to the port" but also "run to the fields." Especially during the next two years of economic adjustment, agriculture and grain production must be prioritized in rural economic work. Based on these guiding principles, the Provincial Party Committee and the Provincial Government have decided to strengthen leadership in agriculture and service to farmers by selecting government officials to be stationed in townships as part-time officials, with an average of no less than 1.5 officials per township.

The part-time officials stationed in townships will primarily be responsible for assisting in the development of agricultural production. They will help disseminate and implement the spirit of the National Rural Work Conference, making the idea of vigorously developing agriculture and achieving a bumper grain harvest next year known to every household and understood by everyone. Before the spring plowing season, they will help strengthen and supplement the leadership teams at the grassroots level. They will promptly report new situations and problems in agricultural production to higher authorities and help solve production difficulties. They will implement next year's production plans and measures to increase production, doing everything possible to achieve a bumper grain harvest next year.

　　既要“跑口岸”　更要“跑田岸”
    江苏派千余干部赴苏北粮区
    本报讯  新华社记者周振丰报道：“农业要上去，机关要服务”。江苏省选派１６００名机关干部赴苏北重点产粮区的徐州、淮阴、盐城、扬州和连云港等五市驻乡镇兼职，帮助当地发展粮食生产。这是省委、省政府加强农业第一线领导力量，服务农业，服务农民，夺取明年粮食丰收所采取的一项措施。
    徐、淮、盐、扬、连五市，是江苏的主要产粮区，又是商品粮的“重头户”。近年来，这里的县、乡领导同样存在着跑城市联系工业项目多，下乡忙粮食生产少的现象。因而，对农业和农民生产中的实际困难，帮助和解决得不够。农业的领导力量相对削弱。根据全国农村工作会议精神，江苏省委、省政府认为：必须高度重视和大力发展农业，县、乡领导要抓工业，也要抓农业，不仅要“跑口岸”，更要“跑田岸”。尤其是明后两年经济调整时期，更应把农业和粮食的稳定增长放在农村经济工作的首位来抓。从这些指导思想出发，省委、省政府决定强化对农业的领导，强化对农民的服务，选派机关干部驻乡镇兼职，按每个乡镇平均不少于１．５名机关干部抽调。
    驻乡镇兼职干部，主要承担帮助发展农业生产的任务，协助基层宣传和贯彻全国农村工作会议精神，使大力发展农业、夺取明年粮食丰收的思想家喻户晓、人人明白；在春耕大忙前帮助充实和配备好基层领导班子；及时向上级反映农业生产中的新情况、新问题，切实帮助解决生产中的困难；落实明年的生产计划和增产措施，千方百计夺取明年的粮食丰收。　　　　　（新华社供本报专稿）
