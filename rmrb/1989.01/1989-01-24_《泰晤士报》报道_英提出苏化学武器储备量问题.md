The Times reported that the British government, after receiving intelligence that the Soviet Union's chemical weapons stockpiles are six times greater than what it has admitted, has decided to raise the issue with the Soviet Union.

The report said that British Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher plans to bring up this issue during Mikhail Gorbachev's visit to Britain. Defense Secretary George Younger also plans to take a firm stance on this issue during his meeting with Soviet Defense Minister Dmitry Yazov. The Times did not disclose which intelligence agency obtained the information on the Soviet Union's chemical weapons stockpiles, only stating that "it has been confirmed that the Soviet Union has at least 300,000 tons of chemical weapons."

    新华社伦敦１月２３日电  据英国《泰晤士报》２３日报道，英国政府在接到关于苏联的化学武器储备超出其所承认储量之６倍的情报之后，决定就此事向苏联提出质对。
    报道说，英国首相撒切尔夫人打算在戈尔巴乔夫访英时向他提出这个问题，国防大臣扬格也打算在会见苏联国防部长亚佐夫时在此问题上采取强硬立场。《泰晤士报》没有透露是什么情报机关以及如何搞到苏联化学武器储备情报的，只是说“已确认苏联至少有３０万吨化学武器储备”。
