Title: The Forest Outside the Window

I live on the edge of the city, in a six-story building, on the top floor. There are no taller buildings nearby.

Below the south window is a quiet street. South of the street is a short wall, and beyond the wall is a large forest. I never asked whether it is naturally grown or artificially planted.

At the end of the forest, there used to be only one hotel, which was the most luxurious accommodation in the city in the 1960s, but now it has lost its luster. To the southeast, a Sino-foreign joint venture hotel, Waterfall Cave Hotel, has been built. A bit further to the east, there is a Friendship Store with a novel layout. To the southwest, a television transmission tower has been erected.

The Waterfall Cave Hotel is pure white, like a white cloud floating over a green sea. The Friendship Store is a light yellow color, like an island in the sea. And the television tower? It looks like a mast without a sail.

The forest itself is not a chaotic mess; it is clearly divided into several layers: some are dark green, some are bright green, and the new branches near the ground are a pale yellow. On sunny days, the leaves shine like little stars, reflecting the sunlight. On cloudy days, the older branches appear dull, but the new branches still show their vitality. Only during the rain do they sway differently, with the older ones struggling and the younger ones playing, like a group of lively children having a water fight in the rain.

My wife and daughter are both in Beijing and have not yet come to this new home I recently moved into. This summer, they wrote saying, "We heard it's hotter there than in Beijing. It's better for us to go there, but it's better for you to stay in Beijing for a few more days." I replied, "There is a forest outside my window." That sentence worked like magic, faster than a telegram, and brought them here.

"Wow, what a beautiful forest!"

I have gotten used to living here, so it seems ordinary to me. My little daughter, who just moved from a crowded courtyard in Beijing to recover here, stands by the window with her crutches, excitedly discovering this.

She had surgery on her knee and came here with her mother, who is on summer vacation, to recover. She can't go downstairs, so she spends her days reading and resting, gazing out the window at the forest, as if she can see something magical or find a spiritual remedy to heal her leg. Especially on rainy days, she listens with both her eyes and ears to the secrets within.

"Dad, did you hear that?"

"I didn't hear anything."

"It's so beautiful, really beautiful!" She sighed in admiration, as if she could turn her crutches into wings and fly into the misty forest.

After the rain, someone knocked on the door. It was an old friend from my days of being "sent down" to the countryside. He had been busy with his individual business for four years, often traveling to Guangzhou and Shantou for supplies, and hadn't come to see me much. Two years ago, he wanted to change his house, and I had helped him find a unit here, but he wrinkled his nose and said, "Nangao? I wouldn't go there! It's a half-rural, half-urban edge area. You shouldn't go either, absolutely not!" At that time, I didn't have a choice and moved from a small room to a unit, which was like a step up to heaven. But he somehow managed to get a house in the most bustling area of the city, near his stall in the clothing market, making everything convenient. This time he came to my house, and when he first came in, he didn't seem to appreciate the furnishings, but when he walked to the south window, he couldn't help but exclaim, "Wow, what a big forest!" His face showed a look of longing.

As he was about to leave, he jokingly said to me, "Brother, can you lend me a piece of this forest?" I just smiled and shook my head. Then I thought, it's not entirely a joke. A few years ago, when my old friend was in financial difficulty, I did lend him money; but this forest, I can't and have no right to lend.

As he left, he still regretted saying to me, "I have everything now, composite furniture, high-end appliances... just not this forest."

After my old friend left, I carefully looked at the forest outside the window that I had grown accustomed to, as if I had discovered something new: the forest is not mine, but it also belongs to me; just as the air is not mine, but I also have my share of it.

My room does not have high-end composite furniture, nor do I want to buy it; I temporarily do not have a refrigerator because it is hard to get. But outside my window, there is a forest that is rare in the city, a very large forest. I lack some other colors, but I have the most abundant green.

I am also rich.

### 窗外那片树林

　　窗外那片树林
    石英
    我住在市区边缘，是六层楼，在最高层，附近再没有更高的建筑了。
    南窗下是一条幽静的马路，马路南是短墙，短墙那边是一片很大的树林，究竟是自生的还是人工栽植的我没有问。
    树林的尽头，原来只有一家宾馆，６０年代，是全市最豪华的住处，现在可大大逊色了。东南面，又建成了中外合资的水帘洞宾馆；再往这边一点，是格局新颖的友谊商店；西南方，还矗起一架电视发射塔。
    那水帘洞宾馆是纯白色的，就像绿海上浮起一朵白云；友谊商店是米黄色，好似大海中的一座岛礁；而电视塔呢，像不像是一杆没挂帆的桅樯？
    这树林看上去也并非芜杂一片，它清晰地分成若干层次：有的暗绿，有的鲜绿，近处刚刚出生的枝叶，是鹅黄色的。晴天时，那叶片都像是一个个会发光的小星星，在朝阳中反射着亮色；阴天时，那些陈旧的枝叶都蒙上了一层晦暗，而新出生的树冠，依然奋展着自身的活力。唯有下雨时，它们才不同程度地摇曳着，年老的在搏斗，在抗争，新生的在嬉戏，好像一群活泼泼的孩子，在雨阵里斗水仗，往伙伴身上洒水。
    我的妻子和女儿都在北京，还没来过这分到不久的新居。今年暑假，她们来信说：“听说你那里比北京热，我们去那里，不如你来北京多住些天。”我一来因为工作忙，二来急切想叫她们来看看新居，便回信说：“我窗外有一片树林。”这句话还真灵，比电报还快地把她们给引来了。
    “咦，多好的一片树林！”
    我在这里住惯了，倒也习以为常，刚从北京闹市区大杂院里来这里养病的小女儿拄着双拐，兀立窗前，惊喜地道出了她的这一发现。
    她是因为膝盖骨受伤，住院动过手术后，由她正度暑假的妈妈带她来我这里休养的。她不能下楼，整日里就是看书，休息时便凝视着窗外那片树林，就像从里面能察视出一般人发现不了的神奇，或是能寻求到使自己腿疾早些愈合的精神药剂。特别是在雨天里，她不仅用眼睛，也用耳朵，审听着那里面的什么秘密。
    “爸爸，你听出来了吗？”
    “我听不出来。”
    “好听，真好听！”她神往地赞叹着，那样子恨不能将双拐变成双翅，飞到那腾着雨雾的树林里。
    天晴后，外面笃笃敲门，是我当年“下放”时的一位工人老朋友来了。他４年前停薪留职干个体户，忙得紧，常跑广州、汕头办货，许多时不到我这儿来了。两年前他要换房子，我曾给他联系过此处的单元房，他一听就撇着嘴说：“南高地？我才不去呢！那是个半乡半城的边缘区。你也别去，千万！”我当时可来不及选择，从斗室里搬到单元房，也算是一步登天了。可他却不知通过什么路子在全市最繁华的劝业场一带换到了住房，那里离他的摊点服装市场近在咫尺，做什么都极方便。这次他来我家，刚进来时对住室的陈设倒不见得欣赏，但当他走近南窗根下，却不自禁一伸舌头叫了一声：“哟，好大的林子！”脸上露出不胜恋慕之色。
    他将离去时，似开玩笑地对我说：“老兄，你能不能把这树林子借我一块？”我只笑着摇了摇头。再一想，也并非全是玩笑。前几年老朋友生活拮据，我的确借过钱给他；可这树林，我却没法也无权借给的。他走时，还不无遗憾地对我说：“我现在什么都有，组合家具、高档电器……就是没你这儿这样的树林。”
    老朋友走后，我再仔细端详着窗外那片本已看惯了的树林，仿佛又悟出一点新的门道：树林不是我的，却也属于我；正如空气不是我的，却也有我应得的一份。
    我的居室里没有高档组合家具，也不想置办；暂时也还没有电冰箱，因为电冰箱条不好弄；但我窗外有一片城市少有的树林，一片很大很大的树林。我占有的别的色彩是少了些，却拥有最充足的绿。
    我也很富有。
