North Korea and the United States held their first direct diplomatic contact in decades through their diplomats stationed in Beijing.

Xinhua News Agency, Washington, January 26th: U.S. State Department spokesperson Redman confirmed today that diplomats from the United States and the Democratic People's Republic of Korea (North Korea) had met in Beijing. This was the first direct diplomatic contact between the two countries in many years.

Redman stated that, with the assistance of the Chinese government, the political counselors of both countries' embassies in China held two meetings in a neutral location in Beijing. During the first meeting on December 6th of last year, the North Korean side handed over a letter from North Korean Foreign Minister Kim Yong-nam to former U.S. Secretary of State Shultz. In the second meeting on January 24th of this year, the U.S. side responded to the letter from Foreign Minister Kim Yong-nam.

Redman said that the aforementioned meetings were "not substantive negotiations but rather contacts," and these contacts were "beneficial." Both sides presented their respective positions on political and security issues on the Korean Peninsula.

According to other U.S. sources, the main content of the U.S. response to Foreign Minister Kim Yong-nam's letter was that the United States believes it is not the time for the U.S. to play a role in resolving the hostility and tension between North and South Korea. North Korea should first engage in serious negotiations with South Korea on reducing military forces and other issues.

　　朝鲜和美国驻北京外交官进行多年来首次直接接触
    新华社华盛顿１月２６日电  美国国务院发言人雷德曼今天证实，美国和朝鲜民主主义人民共和国的外交官曾在北京进行过会晤。这是两国多年来举行的第一次直接外交接触。
    雷德曼说，在中国政府的帮助下，双方驻华使馆的政治参赞在北京的一个中立地方进行了两次会晤。在去年１２月６日的第一次会晤中，朝鲜方面向美国方面递交了一封朝鲜外交部长金永南致美国前国务卿舒尔茨的信。在今年１月２４日的第二次会晤中，美国方面就金永南外长的信进行了答复。
    雷德曼说，上述会晤“并非实质性谈判，而是接触”，这些接触是“有益的”；“双方阐述了各自对朝鲜半岛政治和安全问题的立场”。
    据其他一些美国人士说，美国方面对金永南外长答复的主要内容是，美国认为现在不是美国在解决朝鲜北南双方敌对情绪和紧张局势方面发挥作用的时候，北朝鲜应当首先同南朝鲜就削减军事力量和其他问题进行认真的谈判。
