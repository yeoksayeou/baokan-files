The new year has begun, and the Vietnamese Foreign Ministry has announced that if a political solution to the Cambodian problem is reached, Vietnam will withdraw all its troops from Cambodia by no later than September of this year. Vietnam has also, for the first time, agreed that the withdrawal of troops and other related solutions "will be implemented under effective international supervision." Compared to the past, Vietnam's current withdrawal statement is indeed a step forward, as it has finally proposed a reasonable timetable for withdrawal, advancing the previously promised withdrawal time by 15 months. International opinion believes that this is a positive gesture from Vietnam.

People have long pointed out that the core of the Cambodian problem is Vietnam's invasion. Therefore, to achieve a political solution, the key issue is the complete withdrawal of Vietnamese troops from Cambodia. The United Nations General Assembly has, over the years, repeatedly passed resolutions demanding that Vietnam withdraw from Cambodia, reflecting the common aspirations and general understanding of the international community. In the past, although all relevant parties have made many efforts to seek a political solution to the Cambodian problem, the process of political resolution has not seen any major breakthroughs due to Vietnam's reluctance to withdraw its troops from Cambodia as soon as possible. The Vietnamese government's announcement on January 6 aligns with the international sentiment and creates conditions for a political solution to the Cambodian problem, and thus is welcome.

Currently, the overall international situation is further easing, and major hotspots around the world are generally cooling down. The Afghan problem, the Iran-Iraq War, and the Southwest African problem have all successively reached political settlement agreements. In contrast, the Vietnam-Cambodia war, which has lasted for 10 years, has not yet ended, which is clearly contrary to the current international trend and has naturally become a focal point of international attention. People around the world are eager for the Cambodian problem to be resolved like other hotspots as soon as possible, so that the war in Cambodia can be extinguished, the suffering people of Indochina can rest, and peace can return to the Asia-Pacific region. The resolution of the Cambodian problem is also beneficial to Vietnam. Everyone knows that soon after the end of the anti-American war, Vietnam launched this protracted war of aggression, which has caused enormous damage to Vietnam's economy, becoming a heavy burden that Vietnam cannot bear, and the people are suffering various hardships. The Vietnamese government is also increasingly isolated internationally. Withdrawing all troops from Cambodia as soon as possible will undoubtedly be beneficial for Vietnam to improve its international image and develop its national economy.

The Vietnamese government's announcement of withdrawal is only a promise. From the commitment to withdraw to the actual complete withdrawal under effective international supervision, there is a long process. The international community expects Vietnam to take more active steps.

　　向前进了一步
    本报评论员
    新年伊始，越南外交部宣布，如果柬埔寨问题达成政治解决，越南至迟在今年９月从柬埔寨全部撤军。越南还第一次表示同意，撤军和其它有关的解决办法“将在有效的国际监督下执行”。同过去相比，越南政府的这次撤军表示不能不说是前进了一步，因为它终究提出了一个像样的撤军时间表，比它早先承诺的撤军时间，提前了１５个月。国际舆论认为，这是越南的一个积极姿态。
    人们早就指出，柬埔寨问题的核心，是越南的入侵，因此要实现政治解决，关键的问题是越南军队全部从柬埔寨撤走。联合国大会多年来一次又一次地通过决议，要求越南从柬埔寨撤军，正是反映了国际社会的共同愿望和普遍认识。过去，尽管有关各方为寻求柬埔寨问题的政治解决作了不少努力，但是，由于越南不肯尽早从柬埔寨全部撤军，政治解决的进程一直没有出现重大突破。越南政府１月６日的宣告，顺乎国际上的人心所向，为柬埔寨问题的政治解决创造了条件，因此是值得欢迎的。
    当前，整个国际形势正进一步趋向缓和，各主要热点地区都在普遍降温。阿富汗问题、两伊战争、西南部非洲问题等都相继达成了政治解决的协议。相形之下，持续了１０年之久的越南侵柬战争却迟迟未能结束，显然是同当今国际潮流相悖的，因而自然成为国际舆论所关注的一个焦点。各国人民迫切希望柬埔寨问题能像其它热点地区一样，尽早取得合理的解决，使柬埔寨的战火得以平息，使苦难的印支人民得以休养生息，使亚太地区重现和平。柬埔寨问题的解决对越南也是有利的。谁都知道，在抗美战争结束后不久，越南便投入了这场旷日持久的侵略战争，这给越南的经济造成巨大的损害，成了越南身上一个难以承受的沉重包袱，人民遭受着种种苦难，越南政府在国际上也越来越孤立。尽早从柬埔寨撤出所有军队，对于越南改善国际形象，发展国民经济，无疑都是有好处的。
    越南政府的撤军宣告只是一种允诺，从承诺撤军到在有效的国际监督下真正全部撤军，有一个很长的过程，国际社会期待着越南政府迈出更加积极的步伐。
