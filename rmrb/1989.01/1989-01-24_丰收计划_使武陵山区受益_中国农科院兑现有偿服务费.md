The "Harvest Plan" Benefits the Wuling Mountains Region
China Agricultural University Pays Compensation Fees

	The China Agricultural University has paid the compensation fees for the "Harvest Plan." Recently, 110,000 yuan from the increased yield in the Wuling Mountains region was awarded to the technical personnel who participated in the "Harvest Plan."

	To accelerate the solution to the problem of insufficient grain in the Wuling Mountains region, in 1988, with the support of the Ministry of Agriculture, the China Agricultural University undertook the "Harvest Plan" for 400,000 mu of rice and corn. Due to effective leadership, appropriate policies, and effective measures, a significant increase in yield was achieved over a large area, which was praised by local officials and the masses. According to the contract for the rice and corn "Harvest Plan," 5% of the increased yield was taken as compensation fees, which were distributed to the technical personnel who directly participated in the "Harvest Plan" based on their contributions.

	Recently, Huayuan County in Hunan Province paid 110,000 yuan in compensation fees to 19 technical personnel from the China Agricultural University. The leadership of the China Agricultural University distributed this money to the technical personnel who directly participated in the "Harvest Plan" based on their contributions.

　　“丰收计划”使武陵山区受益
    中国农科院兑现有偿服务费
    本报讯  中国农科院兑现“丰收计划”有偿服务费，最近从武陵山区提取增产部分的１１万元，奖给了参加“丰收计划”的科技人员。
    为了加快解决武陵山区粮食不足的问题，１９８８年中国农科院在农业部的支持下，承担了４０万亩水稻、玉米“丰收计划”。由于领导得力，政策对头，措施有效，普遍实现了大面积、大范围、大幅度的增产丰收，受到当地干部群众的称赞。根据水稻、玉米“丰收计划”承包协议的规定，提取增产部分的５％左右作为有偿服务费，按贡献大小分给直接参加“丰收计划”的科技人员。
    前不久，湖南省花垣县向中国农科院的１９名科技人员对兑了１１万有偿服务费，中国农科院领导将这笔钱按贡献大小分给了直接参加“丰收计划”的科技人员。
