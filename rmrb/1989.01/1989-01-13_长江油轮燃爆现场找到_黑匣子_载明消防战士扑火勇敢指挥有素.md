The sole on-site video recording of the Longjiang oil tanker explosion has been retrieved from the riverbed at the accident site on the afternoon of January 9th. After technical processing, both the images and sounds on the tape are clear, making it a valuable "black box" for documenting the accident process.

According to survivors of the accident, this video was shot by Program Jǐngfā, Deputy Director of the Propaganda Section of the Wuhan Public Security Bureau Fire Brigade, while firefighters were extinguishing the fire. The situation at the time was extremely dangerous. Later, the ship's body exploded, and the video camera fell into the river. Program Jǐngfā unfortunately died in the accident.

The video is approximately 30 minutes long. The first 20 minutes record the scene of the 63023 oil tanker burning, and the last 10 minutes show firefighters extinguishing the fire on the 63040 oil tanker.

From the video, it is clear that at the time, only the front one-third of the 63040 oil tanker was on fire. Twenty-two firefighters boarded a small motorboat and approached the stern of the oil tanker. They first used water hoses from the small motorboat to spray water on the unburned part of the oil tanker's stern. Soon, the firefighters boarded the oil tanker from the stern and slowly moved forward, spraying water. When they approached the burning point at the bow, they switched to using fire extinguishing foam to spray the fire. After a brief firefighting effort, the fire intensity significantly decreased. Suddenly, the video cut off—the oil tanker exploded.

At today's press conference, Wuhan Public Security Bureau Director Yuèdōnghàn, his voice choked with emotion, told reporters: "The firefighters who boarded the ship to fight the fire were extremely brave and not at all reckless. The person directing the firefighting was Deputy Director of the Fire Brigade, Lǐ Jīnwén, who had participated in oil fire extinguishing training in the Federal Republic of Germany and had experience in this area." In the video, Lǐ Jīnwén is seen running back and forth on the oil tanker, loudly shouting orders, and directing the firefighting efforts.

The video camera used by Program Jǐngfā was damaged by the explosion. After being retrieved from the river, it was covered in mud. It is reported that the video camera had been submerged in the river for seven days and seven nights. Fortunately, the tape was tightly wound, and except for the edges being damaged by water, most of it was not affected by water, and the footage is intact.

　　长江油轮燃爆现场找到“黑匣子”
    载明消防战士扑火勇敢指挥有素
    新华社武汉１月１２日电  （记者陈新洲、通讯员鲁艺兵）长江燃爆油轮爆炸前唯一的现场录像，于本月９日下午从事故现场的江底被打捞上岸，录像带经技术处理后图像和声音都很清晰，成为纪录事故过程的珍贵的“黑匣子”。
    据事故的幸存者介绍，这卷录像是武汉市公安局消防支队宣传科副科长程敬发随消防战士灭火时拍摄的，当时的情况非常危险。后来船体爆炸，录像机掉入江中，程敬发不幸牺牲。
    这卷录像约３０分钟，前２０分钟录的是６３０２３号油轮大火燃烧的情景，后１０分钟是消防战士扑救６３０４０号油轮的镜头。
    从录像上可清楚地看出，当时６３０４０号油轮只有头部１／３的地方起火燃烧。２２名消防战士乘坐小机船靠近油轮船尾，先是在小机船上用水枪向尚未燃烧的油轮尾部喷水，不一会儿，消防队员从油轮尾部上船，向着船首慢慢推进喷水，当他们接近船首燃烧点时，改用灭火泡沫向大火喷射。经过短暂的扑救，火势明显减弱。突然，录像中断了——油轮发生了爆炸。
    武汉市公安局局长乐东汉在今天的新闻发布会上，声音哽咽地对记者说：“消防战士登船救火，非常勇敢，而且并不盲目。指挥救火的是消防支队副队长李金文，他曾在联邦德国参加过扑救油火的培训，有这方面的经验。”录像里，李金文一直在油轮前后奔忙，大声呼喊，指挥扑救。
    程敬发使用的录像机机体已被炸破，从江里捞上来后，上面沾有泥渍。据介绍，录像机曾在江底浸泡了七天七夜，幸亏录像带缠绕得很紧，除边缘部分浸水损坏以外，大部分没有浸水，画面完好。
