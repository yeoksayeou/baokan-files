The Czechoslovak Defense Committee today decided to unilaterally reduce its military by 12,000 troops over the next two years and to cut the defense budget by 15%.

The Defense Committee also decided to gradually decommission 850 tanks, 165 armored personnel carriers, and 51 fighter jets, and to seal the equipment of three combined arms divisions.

Czechoslovakia also decided to reduce the number of division and brigade-level military exercises by 50%, decrease ammunition usage by 25% to 30%, and to deploy at least 20,000 soldiers to military construction units, thereby reducing the number of reservists called up for exercises by 15,000.

Czechoslovak Defense Minister Václavík told reporters from the Czechoslovak News Agency today that during peacetime, Czechoslovakia will seal the equipment of three combined arms divisions, and if necessary, these can be restored to combat readiness within 10 to 15 days.

Václavík also announced that the Soviet Union will withdraw four fully equipped units from Czechoslovakia in 1989, and the remaining forces of a tank division in 1990.

Bulgaria announced today that it will unilaterally reduce its military by 10,000 troops over the next two years, and will reduce its number of tanks by 200, artillery pieces by 200, aircraft by 20, and naval vessels by 5. At the same time, it will cut this year's defense budget by 12%.

This decision was made at a joint meeting of the Bulgarian State Council and the Council of Ministers.

Bulgarian leader Zhivkov pointed out at the meeting that this decision fully aligns with the new political thinking and adapts to the new situation of improving East-West relations. The goal is to shift the focus of national security from military means to political factors.

Television news showed that Defense Minister Zhurov did not attend today's joint meeting of the State Council and the government, and did not participate in the discussion and voting on this important resolution. The first deputy defense minister and chief of the general staff, Semerjiyev, represented the military at this important meeting.
