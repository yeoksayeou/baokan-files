A foreign journalist wrote in a letter to a Chinese friend: "Why has China lost its spirit of self-reliance?" He said, "Seeing recent China is quite regrettable. Everything is about money, money, money... There is no sign of the will of the national leaders and the people to rely on their own strength and strive hard."

His words are sharp and quite offensive. As Chinese people, it is unpleasant to hear this.

His statement is obviously biased. For example, he said, "There is no sign of the will of the national leaders and the people to rely on their own strength and strive hard." This can only be blamed on his limited knowledge. Our national leaders and our people have never slackened in their will to "rely on their own strength and strive hard." The decade of turmoil made China's gap with advanced countries wider, which prompted us to reflect and inspired us to catch up. In the past decade, our reforms and opening up, and the construction of socialism with Chinese characteristics, all reflect our own thinking and embody the "will to rely on our own strength and strive hard." If we do not have a narrow understanding of self-reliance—thinking that only by not accepting foreign aid, not borrowing foreign loans, not introducing foreign advanced technology, equipment, and management experience, and closing the door to build the country can be called self-reliance—then we can confidently say: Opening the door wide, reforming, opening up, and walking our own path is the inheritance and development of the Chinese people's spirit of self-reliance in the new historical period.

In the 1930s, Lu Xun wrote a famous article, "Have the Chinese Lost Their Self-Confidence?" He said, "To say that the Chinese have lost their self-confidence, it is possible to refer to a part of the people, but if it is applied to the whole, it is simply a slander." Today, we can also call the foreign journalist's statement a "slander," and then go to sleep. However, thinking carefully, if a foreign journalist makes a little criticism of China in a letter, which is not so accurate, we put on the hat of "slander," it seems unfair. Looking at the reality, there are so many scandals that lose national dignity and personal integrity, how can we sleep peacefully?

In Beijing, Shanghai, Guangzhou, and those open cities and tourist spots, those who follow foreigners to exchange foreign currency and foreign exchange certificates, the "small speculators," are no longer rare, to the extent that some foreigners have to write in bold Chinese characters on their clothes, "I have no foreign exchange certificates." Is this phenomenon not shocking? In front of the luxurious hotels where foreigners live and various entertainment venues, sometimes there are people who, for a few foreign currencies, for a little foreign goods, or just to "open their eyes," are willing to sell their souls. Is this phenomenon not heartbreaking?

Perhaps, this can only be called "social dregs," they are all insignificant small figures, not enough to illustrate the problem. Then, looking at those large companies, those well-dressed people who negotiate with foreigners, frequently raise their glasses, and sign contracts, are there not shameless people among them? A European businessman who has been stationed in Beijing said: In the early 1980s, a few foreign cigarettes could pave the way for signing a contract worth tens of millions of dollars, "Now, people want to get the benefit of sending their children to study in the West." Look! These people who do business with foreigners have made so much progress! Their business is getting more and more sophisticated, and their appetite is getting bigger and bigger. Unfortunately, the sophisticated part is their personal calculations, and the big part is their selfish desires.

Looking at these corrupt phenomena, can we deny that these Chinese people only have "money, money, money" in their eyes? Can we say they have not lost their spirit of self-reliance?

Thank this foreign journalist for shouting loudly. Every Chinese person, and first of all, the more than 40 million Communist Party members, especially those who are responsible for leading work, should reflect: Have you lost your spirit of self-reliance? It is even more necessary to think about: In the new era of reform and opening up, how will you revitalize your spirit, for the prosperity of our nation, for the prosperity of our country, and for the realization of the great goal of socialist modernization, to be the backbone and spine of China!

　　中国人失掉自力更生精神了吗？
    申今
    有位外国记者在给一位中国朋友的信中提出：“为什么中国失去了自力更生的精神？”他说：“看到最近的中国令人十分遗憾，一切就是钱、钱、钱……国家领导与人民百姓靠自己的力量努力奋斗的意志毫无所闻。”
    他的这番话，言辞激烈，十分刺耳。作为中国人，听了很不是滋味。
    这话有明显的偏颇。例如，他说“国家领导与人民百姓靠自己的力量努力奋斗的意志毫无所闻”，这恐怕只能怪他所闻不多。我们的国家领导人，我们的人民百姓，“依靠自己的力量努力奋斗的意志”，从来没有懈怠过。十年浩劫，使中国同先进国家的差距越来越大，它促使我们反思，激励我们奋起直追。近十年来的改革、开放，建设有中国特色的社会主义，都凝聚着我们自己的思考，都体现了“依靠自己的力量努力奋斗的意志”。如果不对自力更生的精神作狭隘的理解——似乎只有不接受外援、不借外债、不引进外国先进技术设备和管理经验，关起国门搞建设才算自力更生的话，那么，我们可以理直气壮地说：大开国门，改革、开放，走自己的路，是中国人民自力更生精神在新的历史时期的继承和发展。
    ３０年代，鲁迅写过一篇著名的文章《中国人失掉自信力了吗》，他说：“说中国人失掉了自信力，用以指一部分人则可，倘若加于全体，那简直是诬蔑。”今天，我们也可以指这位外国记者的说法为“诬蔑”，然后睡自己的觉去。然而，细想一下，一位外国记者在通信中对中国提出一点批评，只是不那么准确，就扣上“诬蔑”的帽子，似欠公允。再看看现实生活中桩桩件件丢失国格、人格的丑闻，我们又怎么能安然入睡呢？
    在北京、在上海、在广州，在那些开放城市和旅游点，尾随着外国人争兑外币和外汇券的“小倒”们，已经不是少见，以致有的外国人不得不在自己穿的上衣上用醒目汉字写上“我没有外汇券”，这种现象还不叫人触目惊心吗？在外国人居住的豪华宾馆和各式游乐场所门前，有时也出现一些为了几张外币、为了一点洋货，甚至只是为了“开开眼”而“攀干亲”，不惜出卖灵魂的人，这种现象难道还不令人痛心吗？
    或许，这只能称之谓“社会渣滓”，他们都是些无足轻重的小人物，不足以说明问题。那么，放眼那些大公司，那些衣冠楚楚同外商洽谈、频频举杯、签字画押的“大老板”里，又何尝没有寡廉鲜耻之徒呢？一位常驻北京的欧洲商人说：在８０年代初期，几条外国香烟就能为签订价值几十万美元的合同铺平道路，“现在，人们要求得到出钱送他们的子女去西方读大学这样的好处”。请看！这些同外商谈买卖的人“进步”多快！他们的生意越做越精，胃口越来越大。可惜，精的是个人的盘算，大的是一己之贪欲。
    看看这些腐败现象，我们能够否认这些中国人眼里只有“钱、钱、钱”吗？我们能够说他们没有失掉自力更生精神吗？
    感谢这位外国记者大喝一声。每一个中国人，当然首先是四千多万共产党员、特别是担负领导工作的共产党员，都有必要反躬自问：你失掉自力更生精神了吗？更有必要想一想：在改革、开放的新时期你准备怎样振奋精神，为我们民族的强盛，为我们国家的兴旺，为实现社会主义现代化的宏伟目标，做中国的筋骨和脊梁！
