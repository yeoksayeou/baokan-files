Minqiang Village in our county's Dingshan Township has had no unplanned births for 18 consecutive years since 1970.

The village's party organization has fully played the role of party members as models and leaders. Every month, they insist on reporting and checking on family planning during party life meetings. The village often uses large and small meetings, blackboard newspapers, and individual talks to propagate family planning policies to the villagers. They do meticulous ideological work on couples of childbearing age and ensure that they are cared for politically and in their daily lives. For example, Liu Ladan, a villager who moved to his wife's home, already has one child but still wanted another. The village party branch secretary, village head, and women's federation director visited his home five times to do ideological work, finally dispelling his idea of having another child.

　　民强村１８年无计划外生育
    我县丁山乡民强村自１９７０年以来，连续１８年无计划外生育。
    这个村的党组织充分发挥党员的模范带头作用，每月坚持在党的生活会上检查汇报计划生育情况。村里经常利用大小会议、黑板报、个别谈心等形式，向村民宣传计划生育政策，对育龄夫妇做细致的思想工作，并做到从政治上关心，从生活上照顾。如男到女家落户的村民刘腊堂已有一个小孩，还想生一个。村党支部书记、村主任、妇联主任等５次上门做工作，终于打消了他再要一个孩子的念头。
