A major attempt in bioengineering: the era of asexual vegetables has arrived. In the vegetable cultivation industry, an era of "asexual vegetables" that can maintain the quality of superior varieties has arrived. This new method of asexual propagation and seedling cultivation can ensure that vegetables are sterile and disease-free, and can also make vegetables taste fragrant and increase yield. This is another major attempt in bioengineering. Currently, varieties such as asparagus, sweet potatoes, taro, and devil's tongue have been cultivated by a Japanese company into large quantities of "cloned seedlings" and put into practical use in vegetable fields. At present, the price of "cloned seedlings" is still relatively high, and widespread promotion will take some time. However, once the production cost is reduced, the vegetable cultivation industry will undergo a drastic change.

In the current global vegetable market, vegetables like asparagus are very popular and in high demand. To meet market supply and enhance competitiveness, it is necessary to study and adopt new cultivation technologies. For example, asparagus, which has male and female distinctions, is generally preferred by consumers due to its thick and delicious male plants, while the thin and less tasty female plants have caused headaches for growers. Now, using this new method of asexual propagation and seedling cultivation, large quantities of superior male asparagus "cloned seedlings" can be produced, solving this problem.

The company uses the method of "cultivating growth points" to clone superior seedlings. Under a microscope, the growth points, which are 0.2 to 0.3 millimeters long, are first cut off with a sharp blade and then placed in a test tube containing agar bacterial culture medium. Nitrogen, phosphorus, potassium, and other minerals are then added to the test tube. Once new shoots emerge, the growth points on the new shoots are cut off, allowing them to sprout again. After 2 to 3 months, the seedlings will grow to 1 centimeter tall and then be moved to a cultivation box containing agar bacterial culture medium. Finally, each seedling is planted in a hole filled with sterile soil and can be marketed.

Currently, "asexual vegetables" have been put into practical use. The future goal is to reduce the price.

### 生物工程的一大尝试  新的无性蔬菜时代来临

　　生物工程的一大尝试
    新的无性蔬菜时代来临
    在蔬菜种植业中，一个能保持良种品质的“无性蔬菜时代”已经来临。这种新的无性繁殖育苗法可以保证蔬菜无菌、无病，还可以使蔬菜味道香美，产量大增，这是生物工程的又一大尝试。目前，像龙须菜、红薯、青芋、鬼芋等十几个品种的蔬菜，已由日本一家公司培育出大量“复制苗”并引向菜田付诸实用化。现在“复制苗”价格仍然比较昂贵，大面积推广还需一定的时间，然而，一旦生产成本降低，蔬菜种植业必将发生一场天翻地覆的变化。
    在目前的世界菜市场上，像龙须菜之类的蔬菜很受欢迎，非常走俏，要想满足市场供应，增强竞争力，就必须研究采用新的种植技术。譬如，有雄性雌性之分的龙须菜，由于雄性体粗味美，雌性体细味差，一般都喜欢购买雄性龙须菜。但在最初育苗时又无法分辨雌雄，长成后的雌性菜曾使种植商大伤脑筋。而今，使用这种新的无性繁殖育苗法，便可以大量生产优良雄性龙须菜的“复制苗”，解决了这个难题。
    这家公司是采用了“培养生长点”的方法来复制优良苗的。在显微镜下首先把长０．２至０．３毫米的生长点用锐刀切下，然后放进装有琼脂细菌培养基的试管，再向试管中添加氮磷酸、钾和矿物质等，等到发出新芽时，就把新芽上的生长点切下，使其再长出新芽，２至３个月后，苗就会长到１厘米高，然后，移到盛有琼脂细菌培养基的种植箱里。最后在每一个装有无菌土的孔眼里植上一棵苗就可以上市了。
    目前“无性蔬菜”已付诸实用化了，今后的目标是如何降低价格。
