	Bush Sworn In as U.S. President
	Our reporter Cang Lid reports from Washington: U.S. President-elect Bush was sworn in today, officially assuming the position of the 41st President of the United States of America.

	At around 12:00 PM Eastern Standard Time, Bush stood on the steps of the Capitol facing the Washington Monument, his left hand on the Bible used by Washington when he was sworn in as the first U.S. President in 1789. He raised his right hand and recited after Chief Justice William Rehnquist: "I, George Herbert Walker Bush, solemnly swear that I will faithfully execute the office of President of the United States, and will to the best of my ability, preserve, protect and defend the Constitution of the United States."

	At 11:55 AM, Vice President-elect Dan Quayle was sworn in as the U.S. Vice President under the supervision of Justice Sandra Day O'Connor.

	The swearing-in ceremony began at 11:40 AM. When President Reagan and his wife, President-elect Bush and his wife, and Vice President-elect Quayle and his wife appeared on the red-carpeted steps of the Capitol, tens of thousands of people cheered and applauded. The Marine Corps band played a lively brass tune.

	After the swearing-in ceremony, cannons fired around the Capitol. President Bush delivered his inaugural address. He stated that American politics must play a role again, that relations with the Soviet Union would continue to improve, and that issues such as the deficit and drugs needed to be addressed. He said, "The problems we face are large, but our determination is greater." Afterwards, the Bushes and the Reagans bid each other farewell.

	This morning at 9:00 AM, the Bushes first attended a private mass at St. John's Church across from the White House. They then boarded the "U.S. Number 1" large Lincoln limousine with transparent windows and arrived at the White House to meet with the Reagans waiting at the door. At around 11:00 AM, Reagan and Bush rode together in the "U.S. Number 1" along Pennsylvania Avenue from the White House to the Capitol. The streets were lined with spectators. It is said that this traditional ceremony began in 1847.

	Today, approximately 170,000 people participated in the celebrations in Washington. The various ceremonies for the "200th Anniversary of the U.S. Presidency" will continue until the 21st.

　　布什宣誓就任美国总统
    本报华盛顿１月２０日电  记者仓立德报道：美国当选总统布什今天宣誓就职，正式就任美利坚合众国第４１任总统。
    美国东部时间１２时许，布什在国会大厦面朝华盛顿纪念碑的台阶上，左手按住１７８９年华盛顿宣誓就任美国总统时用过的圣经。高举右手，跟着首席大法官林奎斯特念道：“我，乔治·赫伯特·沃尔克·布什庄严宣誓：我将忠实履行合众国总统职责，并将竭尽全力维系、保护和捍卫合众国宪法。”
    １１时５５分，当选副总统丹·奎尔在女大法官康纳主持下正式宣誓就任美国副总统。
    宣誓就职仪式是１１时４０分开始的。当里根总统夫妇、当选总统布什夫妇及当选副总统奎尔夫妇出现在国会大厦铺着红地毯的台阶上时，上万名群众鼓掌、欢呼。海军陆战队军乐队奏起嘹亮的铜管乐。
    宣誓仪式结束后，国会大厦四周响起了礼炮。布什总统发表就职后首次演说。他表示，美国两党政治必须重新发挥作用，将与苏联继续改善关系，并说要解决赤字、毒品等问题。他说，“我们面临的问题很大，但我们的决心更大。”随后布什夫妇与里根夫妇告别。
    今天上午９时，布什夫妇首先在白宫对面的圣约翰教堂参加私人弥撒。之后，乘坐“美国１号”大型林肯牌透明玻璃窗黑色轿车来到白宫，与迎候在门口的里根总统夫妇见面。１１时许，里根和布什共乘“美国１号”沿宾夕法尼亚大道从白宫前往国会。街道两旁挤满观众。据说这一传统仪式始于１８４７年。
    今天约有１７万人在华盛顿参加庆祝活动。“美国总统就职２００周年”的各项庆典将持续至２１日。
