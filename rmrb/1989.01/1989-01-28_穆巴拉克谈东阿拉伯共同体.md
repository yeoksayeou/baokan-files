Egyptian President Mubarak revealed on the 26th at a press conference in Cairo that negotiations are currently underway regarding the establishment of an Eastern Arab Economic Community consisting of Egypt, Jordan, Iraq, and the Yemen Arab Republic.

He said that this economic organization is not directed against anyone, and it is likely that the leaders of the four countries will hold a small summit after discussing the charter of the economic community.

Mubarak made these remarks at the airport after seeing off Jordanian King Hussein, who had made a brief visit to Cairo. Foreign observers in Cairo believe that the establishment of the Eastern Arab Community was the main topic of discussion between the Egyptian and Jordanian leaders.
