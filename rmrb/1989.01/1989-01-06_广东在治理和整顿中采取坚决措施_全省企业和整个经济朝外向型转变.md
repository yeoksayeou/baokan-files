	Guangdong Takes Decisive Measures in Rectification and Adjustment
	The Entire Province's Enterprises and Economy Shift Toward an Export-Oriented Model

	Xinhua News Agency reports: Reporter Liang Zhaoming reports: The Guangdong Provincial Government has decided to take decisive measures against projects and enterprises that compete with the interior for markets and raw materials, in order to steer the entire province's enterprises and economy toward an export-oriented model. Those that need to be controlled will be controlled, and those that need to be halted will be halted.

	To achieve this goal, the provincial government requires all local governments to fully leverage the advantages of opening up to the outside world, to better utilize foreign capital, and to develop "two ends outside" and "large-scale import and export" processing businesses. At the same time, it further clarifies the objects and measures for protection and control: For energy and "short-term" raw materials, suitable light textile products, and scarce commodities that bring in more currency, as well as export products, protective policies will be implemented, with priority support in terms of funds, electricity, and other aspects. For stagnant, "long-term" products, low-quality, poor-performance products, and general processing products that consume too much energy and raw materials, decisive measures will be taken to control and reduce them.

	According to relevant provincial departments, in terms of fixed asset investment for the entire society this year, the province will reduce the planned investment by 20.5% compared to last year, to ensure investment in key projects such as education, agriculture, electricity, transportation, and scarce raw materials. In adjusting the product structure, limited energy, raw materials, and funds will be used for products that can increase market supply and expand exports and foreign exchange earnings. In adjusting the existing fund structure, efforts will be made to utilize foreign capital through multiple channels. The goal is to raise production to a new level during the rectification and adjustment period.

　　广东在治理和整顿中采取坚决措施
    全省企业和整个经济朝外向型转变
    本报讯  记者梁兆明报道：广东省政府为使全省企业和整个经济朝外向型转变，决定对那些与内地争市场、争原材料的项目和企业采取坚决的措施，该压的压，该刹的刹。
    为了达到这个目标，省政府要求全省各地充分发挥对外开放的优势，更多、更好地利用外资，发展“两头在外”、“大进大出”的来料加工业务。同时，进一步明确保和压的对象及处理措施：对于能源和“短线”原材料、适销对路的轻纺产品和回笼货币多的紧俏商品，以及出口产品的生产，实行保护政策，在资金、电力等方面予以优先支持；对那些滞销、“长线”产品，质量低、性能差的产品以及过多消耗能源、原材料的一般加工产品，采取坚决措施控制和压缩。
    据省有关部门透露，在基本建设方面，全省今年的全社会固定资产投资比去年计划压２０．５％，以保证教育、农业、电力、交通和紧缺原材料重点项目的投资。在产品结构调整中，把有限的能源、原材料和资金，用于能够增加市场有效供给和扩大出口创汇的产品。在对原有的资金结构调整中，力求多渠道地利用外资。争取在治理、整顿中使生产发展到新的水平。
