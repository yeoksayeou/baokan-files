The Polish government is willing to discuss union pluralism and other issues with unions. A round-table conference involving all parties will be held soon.

Xinhua News Agency, Warsaw, January 10 (Reporter Dong Fusheng) The Polish government spokesman, Urban, announced at a press conference today that the government is willing to discuss union pluralism and other issues with unions.

Urban made the above statement in response to a declaration issued by the Executive Committee of the Polish National Union Council on January 9 regarding union pluralism and other issues.

Union pluralism is a political slogan proposed by former Solidarity Union chairman Lech Wałęsa to restore the legal status of the Solidarity Union. At that time, the chairman of the Polish National Union Council, Miodowicz, clearly expressed his opposition to the idea of establishing two unions in one factory, believing that this would inevitably cause a split in the ranks of the workers. The government, however, stated that union issues should be resolved by the unions themselves.

The Executive Committee of the Polish National Union Council held a meeting on the 9th and issued a declaration on union pluralism and other issues. The declaration stated that the basis for union pluralism is political pluralism. Without political pluralism, union pluralism has the danger of further social antagonistic division. The Executive Committee determined the issues to be prepared for negotiation and discussion with the government.

Xinhua News Agency, Warsaw, January 10 (Reporter Tang Deqiao) The Polish government spokesman, Urban, said here today that the Polish "round-table conference" without any preconditions might start soon.

Urban said in response to a reporter's question at a press conference today that the preparatory working-level talks for the "round-table conference" are "proceeding at an accelerated pace."

The suggestion to hold a "round-table conference" was made by Polish Interior Minister Kiszczak in August last year when the wave of strikes in Poland began to subside. To implement this suggestion, Kiszczak had met with former Solidarity Union chairman Lech Wałęsa four times to exchange views on the time, place, participants, and agenda of the conference. Due to differing views on the above issues, the "round-table conference" has not yet been held.

Urban pointed out that whether the "round-table conference" can be held soon depends on the attitude of Lech Wałęsa and other "constructive oppositionists." He believes that they talk a lot but do little, entangling themselves in some controversial issues to delay the convening of the "round-table conference."

　　波政府准备同工会讨论工会多元化
    有关各方的圆桌会议将很快举行
    新华社华沙１月１０日电  （记者董福生）波兰政府发言人乌尔班今天在记者招待会上宣布，政府愿意同工会讨论工会多元化以及其他问题。
    乌尔班是针对波兰工会全国协议会执委会１月９日就工会多元化及其他一些问题发表的一项声明作上述表示的。
    工会多元化，这是前团结工会主席瓦文萨为争取恢复团结工会合法地位而提出的一个政治口号。波兰工会全国协议会主席米奥多维奇当时曾明确表示反对在一个工厂里建立两个工会的主张，认为这势必造成工人队伍的分裂。政府则表示，工会问题应由工会自己解决。
    波兰工会全国协议会执委会９日举行会议，就工会多元化等问题发表的声明说，工会多元化的基础是政治多元化，没有政治多元化的工会多元化，有产生社会进一步对抗性分化的危险。工会执委会确定了准备同政府谈判和讨论的问题。
    新华社华沙１月１０日电　（记者汤德乔）波兰政府发言人乌尔班今天在这里说，不提任何先决条件的波兰“圆桌会议”可能很快就开始举行。
    乌尔班今天在记者招待会上回答记者提问时说，筹备“圆桌会议”的工作性会谈“正在加速进行”。
    召开“圆桌会议”的建议是在去年波兰８月工潮趋向缓和的情况下由波兰内政部长基什查克提出的。为了落实这一建议，基什查克曾４次会晤前团结工会主席瓦文萨，就会议时间、地点、参加人员和议题交换意见。由于双方在上述问题上观点不一，“圆桌会议”迄今未能举行。
    乌尔班指出，“圆桌会议”能否早日举行取决于瓦文萨等“建设性反对派”的态度。他认为，他们谈得多，做得少，纠缠一些有争议的问题，以推迟“圆桌会议”的召开。
