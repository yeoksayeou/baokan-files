　　继续推进中美洲和平进程    
    墨西哥外长出访中美洲五国
    新华社墨西哥城１月２９日电（记者王权富）墨西哥新任外交部长费尔南德·索拉纳·莫拉莱斯１月２４日至２８日对中美洲危地马拉、哥斯达黎加、尼加拉瓜、洪都拉斯和萨尔瓦多５国进行了工作访问。这是卡洛斯·萨利纳斯·德戈塔里去年１２月１日就任墨西哥总统以来，墨西哥外长的第一次出国访问。
    墨西哥外交部发表的公报说，索拉纳·莫拉莱斯外长的中美洲之行的主要目的是与各国领导人就中美洲地区冲突问题交换意见，为中美洲第三次首脑会议的召开起桥梁作用，以继续推进中美洲的和平进程。
    索拉纳·莫拉莱斯在紧张的５天访问中，会见了中美洲５国的总统，向他们强调中美洲对墨西哥的重要性，并重申了墨西哥新政府对中美洲的政策。
    索拉纳在这次中美洲之行中还向各国领导人表示，墨西哥支持中美洲各国提出的有利于巩固和平、民主和经济发展的所有倡议，中美洲的问题应该由中美洲人民自己解决。
