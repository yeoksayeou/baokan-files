Peruvian Foreign Minister Luis Gonzalez Posada said on January 26 that Peru and China have solid relations. He emphasized that both the current government and all future governments of Peru will prioritize the relationship between the two countries.

In response to reports that the Taiwan authorities are exploiting Peru's current economic difficulties to turn trade companies in Peru into "national" representative offices, the Peruvian foreign minister said, "This is pure rumor and media speculation." He stressed that Peru adheres to a foreign policy of respecting the sovereignty of all countries, and that the "Far East Trade Center" in Peru is merely a trade institution.

　　秘鲁外交部长发表谈话指出    
    秘鲁中国关系牢固
    新华社利马１月２６日电  秘鲁外长路易斯·冈萨雷斯·波萨达２６日在回答新华社记者提问时说，秘鲁和中国的关系是牢固的。不论是秘鲁现政府还是未来的所有政府，都会把两国关系放在首位。
    针对有关台湾当局正利用秘鲁目前的经济困难，准备把在秘的贸易公司变成“国家”代办机构的报道，秘鲁外长说，“这纯属谣言和报界的推测。”他强调，秘鲁坚持尊重各国主权的国际政策，台湾在秘鲁的“远东贸易中心不过是一个贸易机构而已”。
