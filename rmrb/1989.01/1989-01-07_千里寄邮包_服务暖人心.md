Last July, I bought an electronic game console made by Hangzhou Huaxing Refrigerator Factory. Due to improper use, I broke one of the plastic parts. In August, I wrote to the factory's sales department and sent them 5 yuan. After a month with no response, I wrote another letter to the factory director, requesting assistance. Soon after, I received two packages. The postal receipts showed that they were sent on August 28 and September 20. It turned out that the factory had promptly sent the parts after receiving my letter. The delay in receiving the mail was due to postal issues. After installing the parts, my children were happy to play with the electronic game console again.

　　千里寄邮包  服务暖人心
    我去年７月间，买了一台杭州华星冰箱厂生产的电子游戏机。由于使用不慎，将一个塑料零件弄坏了。我于８月给这个厂的销售科去了一封信，并寄去５元钱。时隔一个月没有音信，我又提笔给华星冰箱厂厂长去了一封信，要求帮助解决。不久，我先后收到两个邮包，发现邮包单上的邮寄日期，一个是８月２８日，一个是９月２０日。原来厂方接到我的信后，及时把零件寄出了。我迟迟收不到邮件，是邮路耽搁了。我把零件安上后，孩子们又高兴地玩起电子游戏。
