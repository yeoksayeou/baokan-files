	The Night in the Ice Palace Bridal Chamber
	Chang Qing

	In the depths of winter, the ice lanterns of the northern regions attract hundreds of thousands of tourists. People say that these ice lanterns are like grand palaces!

	This is a metaphor. However, in history, there was indeed an ice palace that not only housed people but also served as a bridal chamber for newlyweds. It was a unique creation by the Russian Empress Anna Ivanovna in 1740 for a malicious purpose.

	In the winter of 1740, Europe experienced an unprecedented severe cold. Empress Anna Ivanovna staged a cruel prank that winter. Originally, a prince in the court, Mikhail Golitsyn, had married an Italian Catholic without her consent. The empress was extremely displeased and sought an opportunity for revenge. Soon, the opportunity came. The prince's wife passed away, and she bestowed upon him an ugly Kamchadal servant girl as his wife. This was not enough; the empress looked out at the falling snow and suddenly had an idea—to make them spend their wedding night in an ice palace! Thus, she ordered her servants to begin constructing the ice palace.

	After the efforts of thousands of artisans, a Russian-style palace stood on the frozen land of Russia. It was 24.5 meters long, 7 meters high, and 7 meters wide, with a hall, dining room, and bedroom inside. The most striking feature was the double bed supported by four ice pillars carved with intricate patterns. On the cold bed lay a pair of pillows, two sleeping caps, and blankets and quilts for the newlyweds.

	Around the ice palace, there were ice sculptures of birch trees, pine trees, and orange trees. Some trees even bore abundant ice fruits, and the branches were perched with lifelike ice birds. The most eye-catching was the ice elephant in front of the palace gate, with an ice figure dressed in Persian attire riding on its back. At night, a flame fueled by oil would spout from the elephant's trunk, illuminating the crystal-clear ice palace, creating a magnificent sight. Additionally, there were eight ice-cast cannons outside the palace, making the palace appear majestic and solemn.

	On the day of the prince's wedding, the unfortunate couple was locked in an iron cage and carried into the ice palace by an elephant. The newlyweds spent their wedding night in this transparent ice palace...

	Although the empress's prank is despicable, the short-lived artistic treasure created by countless artisans has left an unforgettable mark on the world's art stage.

　　冰宫洞房夜
    常青
    正值寒冬，北国的冰灯吸引了成千上万的游客，人们说，那一座座冰灯，如同一座座大的宫殿啊！
    这是比喻。然而，历史上也确有过一座不但住过人，而且作为新婚洞房的冰宫。它是１７４０年沙俄女皇安娜·伊凡诺夫娜出于罪恶目的而别出心裁的产物。
    １７４０年冬，欧洲大地出现前所未有的特大的严寒。女皇安娜·伊凡诺夫娜就在这年冬天导演了一场恶作剧。原来，宫中一位亲王迈可·戈立辛在没有征得她同意的情况下，私自与一位意大利天主教徒结了婚。女皇极为不满，并寻机报复。不久，机会终于来了，亲王的妻子病故，她便赐他一个相貌丑陋的喀慕克族女仆为妻，这还不够，女皇遥望窗外大雪，忽然心生一计，要让他们在冰宫中度过新婚之夜！于是，她吩咐下人开始建造冰宫。
    经过成千艺术工匠的努力，一座俄罗斯风格的旷古宫殿屹立在严寒的沙俄大地上。它长２４米半、高７米、宽７米，里面分有客厅、餐厅和卧室。其中引人注目的是那张用四根雕有精彩花纹的冰柱支撑的双人床。在冰冷的床上，放着新人的一对枕头、两顶睡帽以及毯子、被褥等物品。
    冰宫的四周，有冰雕的桦树、松树、桔树，有的树上还结着丰硕的冰果，树枝上还蹲着造型生动的冰鸟。最引人注目的是冰宫门前那头冰象，象背上骑着一个穿波斯服装的冰人。晚上，从象鼻孔中喷出一股以油为燃料的灯火，与晶莹的冰宫相辉映，非常壮观。此外，冰宫的外面还有冰雕的８门大炮，使宫殿显得威武、庄严。
    亲王成婚的那天，这对不幸的人被关在铁笼子里，由大象驮着进入冰宫。新人就在这透明的冰宫中度过了洞房花烛之夜……
    女皇的恶作剧虽然令人不齿，但无数艺术家们创造的这一短暂的艺术之宝，却在世界艺坛上留下了不能遗忘的一笔。
