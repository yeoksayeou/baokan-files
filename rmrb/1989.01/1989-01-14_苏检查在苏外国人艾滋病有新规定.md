The Presidium of the Supreme Soviet of the USSR has issued supplementary regulations to its August 25, 1987, announcement on measures to prevent AIDS.

The supplementary regulations stipulate that all foreign citizens staying in the USSR for more than three months must undergo AIDS screening unless they possess certificates of having undergone such screening as stipulated in special agreements between countries. This regulation came into effect on January 1, 1989.

This was announced by Grasyimov, Director of the Press Department of the Soviet Foreign Ministry, at a press conference held in Moscow on January 11. He said that if a foreign citizen refuses to undergo screening, he will be advised to leave the USSR. If he refuses both the screening and to leave the country, he will be detained and expelled from the USSR upon approval by the procuracy.

　　苏检查在苏外国人艾滋病有新规定
    新华社莫斯科１月１２日电  苏联最高苏维埃主席团对它１９８７年８月２５日宣布的预防艾滋病措施又作出补充规定。
    补充规定要求，凡在苏联停留超过３个月的外国公民，如无按专门协定互相承认的受过艾滋病检查的证件，必须在苏联接受检查。这项规定今年１月１日起生效。
    这是苏联外交部新闻局局长格拉西莫夫１１日在此间举行的新闻发布会上宣布的。他说，如果外国公民拒绝检查，将建议他离开苏联。如果他既拒绝检查，又拒绝离境，则经检察机关批准予以拘留并驱逐出境。
