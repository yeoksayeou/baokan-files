Three young Kazakh men named Bahati, independently came to the only gold panning boat in the Alataw Gold Company in Altay City, Xinjiang. Traditionally, as sons of the Kazakh people, their lives should revolve around horses, yurts, grasslands, and herds of sheep. However, they chose a completely different path, voluntarily signing up to join the ranks of gold panners. Meng Qingzhu, the deputy manager of the Kelamayi Gold Mine and the captain of the gold panning boat (Han Chinese), refers to them as Big Bahati, Bahati, and Little Bahati. Among the 26 workers on the gold panning boat, there are 10 Kazakh young men. Meng Qingzhu introduced, "This year, when the ice and snow melted in the Altay region, there were about two thousand Kazakhs who went to the valleys to pan for gold."

"The 72 gullies (rivers), each with gold," refers to the Kazakh inhabited Altay. The "72 gullies" is just an approximate number; in reality, there are over 100 gullies and rivers. The statement "each with gold" is not exaggerated; during the period of the Kuomintang rule, at least 400,000 taels of gold were produced here. The mining of gold in the Altay region can be traced back to the Qianlong era of the Qing Dynasty.

However, gold has not made the Kazakhs rich; most people have only solved the problem of basic sustenance. Akhan, the deputy director of the Propaganda Department of the Altay Regional Committee and a graduate of the Central Party School, said, "The older generation of Kazakhs followed the water and grass, their ideal was lush pastures and herds of cattle and sheep, and they were not accustomed to panning for gold." Another local comrade told us a true story: a Kazakh youth did business for three years and was scolded by his elders for three years. Therefore, panning for gold and selling gold seemed unimaginable. We traveled up the Qiemoerqieke River and saw over two hundred kilometers of riverbeds filled with gold panners, but the herdsmen by the river paid no attention to the scene on the riverbed. When the gold was taken away by outsiders and exchanged for wealth, the herdsmen's yurts by the river even lacked medicine.

Is it the pressure of poverty, or the updating of concepts? Today, many Kazakh young men are the first to join the ranks of gold panners. In the Erqisi River, Qulete River, and other large and small gullies and rivers, wherever there are gold panners, there are Kazakh youths. There are even more Kazakh gold panners in the Habah River and Kejike River valleys. Most Kazakh young men join gold panning teams led by people from inland regions, some participate in regional and municipal gold panning teams, and many also work independently. Wang Junrong, the director of the Altay Regional Gold Mining Office (Han Chinese), said, "Kazakh young men have less gold panning technology, but they can endure hardship. When they team up with experienced gold panners from inland regions, their output is relatively high, and they earn more money." Kazakh young men who participate in gold panning teams organized by the region and the city can mine about one tael of gold each in the six-month gold panning season, equivalent to over 1,200 yuan. Independent gold panners earn less; several Kazakh herdsmen panning for gold in the Lahubaerba and Dalengluoba regions can only mine about 10 grams of gold in one gold panning season, equivalent to about 380 yuan. However, for the herdsmen on the grasslands, 300 yuan is already a considerable sum of money.

To both protect the Kazakhs' pastures and help them become rich through gold panning, the Altay region has formulated a series of practical policies and regulations, stipulating that mining is not allowed in concentrated pasture areas, those who damage pastures must pay for pasture restoration, organizing independent gold panners to mine collectively (last year, over 70 gold panning teams were organized), and demarcating gold panning areas, etc. Although the number of gold panners who entered the mountains last year was more than the previous year, the situation of pasture damage has significantly decreased.

The lives of gold panners are quite hard. Kazakhs who are used to living in yurts can only live in underground shelters after going down to the riverbed. However, for the Kazakh young men in the gold panning river, gold panning is their entire life and also their entire hope. Therefore, their work ethic is beyond reproach. Take the three Bahatis on the gold panning boat, for example. Little Bahati has only been here for two months and can already handle things independently; his work has never had any mistakes. Big Bahati has a strong sense of responsibility and has already become a team leader. The captain, Meng Qingzhu, quietly told me that Big Bahati is the only candidate for the deputy captain. Bahati is 20 years old this year and has already become the person in charge of a position. When we boarded the gold panning boat, he had just returned from the sand excavation site. His black riding suit and blue jeans were covered with yellow sand, and his hair was also full of sand. He told us, "Among the Kazakh young men, there are many named Bahati. On other riverbeds, there are also many gold panners named Bahati. The three words 'Bahati' mean 'happiness' in Kazakh."

Oh, Bahati, may gold bring you "Bahati"!

　　跳下马背去淘金
    本报记者  罗盘
    三个名叫巴哈提的哈萨克族小伙子，不约而同地来到了新疆阿勒泰市黄金公司唯一的采金船上。本来，作为哈萨克的儿子，他们传统的生活轨迹应该是马背、毡房、草原和羊群。但是，他们选择了与传统完全不同的生活和工作，自愿报名，加入了淘金者的行列。克拉玛依金矿副矿长、采金船船长孟庆祝（汉族），把他们分别称为大巴哈提、巴哈提、小巴哈提。在采金船上的２６名工人中，哈萨克小伙子就有１０人。孟庆祝介绍说：“阿勒泰地区今年冰雪融化时，有一两千名哈萨克人下沟淘金。”
    “７２条沟（河），沟沟有黄金”，说的就是哈萨克族聚居的阿勒泰。“７２条沟”只是个概数，这里实际上有１００多条沟河。“沟沟有黄金”则一点不假，仅国民党统治时期，这里出产的黄金就至少有４０余万两。阿勒泰地区的黄金开采，最早可以追溯到清朝乾隆年间。
    不过，黄金并没有使哈萨克人致富，大多数人仅仅解决了温饱问题。阿勒泰地委宣传部副部长、毕业于中央党校的哈萨克男子汉阿汗说：“老一辈的哈萨克人逐水草而居，他们的理想是肥美的水草、成群的牛羊，对淘金是不习惯的。”另一位当地同志向我们叙述了一个真实的故事：有位哈萨克青年做了三年买卖，竟被长辈骂了三年。因此，淘金、卖金，似乎是难以想象的。我们溯切木尔切克河行走，只见两百余公里的河床上洒满淘金人，可是河边的牧民对河床上的景象却漠不关心。当黄金被外来的采金人带走、换取财富时，河边牧民的毡房里甚至缺医少药。
    是贫困的压力，还是观念的更新？今天，不少哈萨克小伙子率先走进了淘金者的行列。在额尔齐斯河、却勒特河等大大小小的沟河里，只要有淘金人，就有哈萨克青年。哈巴河和克即河谷的哈萨克淘金人更多。哈萨克小伙子大多加入由内地人牵头组成的淘金队，部分人参加了地区和市里的采金队，也有不少人单打独干。阿勒泰地区矿产黄金办公室主任王俊荣（汉族）说：“哈萨克小伙子采金技术差一些，但是他们能吃苦，跟有经验的内地淘金人搭伙，产量比较高，赚的钱也多。”参加地区和市里组织的采金队的哈萨克小伙子，在每年６个月的采金季节里，每人大约可以采到一两黄金，合１２００多元人民币。单干的淘金人所获较少，在劳合巴斯道和达伦落巴地区的几个淘金的哈萨克牧民，平均每人在一个采金季节里只能采到１０克黄金，约合人民币３８０多元。不过，对草原上的牧民来说，３００多元已是一笔很可观的收入了。
    为了既保护哈萨克人的牧场，又帮助哈萨克人通过淘金致富，阿勒泰地区制订了一整套切实可行的政策和规定，规定不许在牧场集中地区开采，破坏草场者要交纳草场恢复费、组织单打独干的淘金人集体开采（去年已组织这些人成立了７０多个淘金队）、划定淘金地段等等。去年进山的淘金人虽然比前年多了，但草场破坏情况已明显减少。
    淘金人的生活相当艰苦，住惯了毡房的哈萨克人，下到河床后只能住地窖子。然而，对于淘金河里的哈萨克小伙子来说，淘金是他们的全部生活，也是他们生活的全部希望。因此，他们工作的认真劲是无可指摘的。就说采金船上的三个巴哈提吧，小巴哈提才来两个月，已经可以独当一面了，他的工作从没出现过失误。大巴哈提工作责任心强，已经当上了班长。船长孟庆祝悄悄告诉我，大巴哈提是副船长的唯一人选。巴哈提今年２０岁，已成为一个岗位的负责人。我们踏上采金船时，他刚从挖沙地点回来，黑色骑士服和蓝色牛仔裤上沾满了黄色沙粒，头发里也满是沙土。他告诉我们说：“我们哈萨克族小伙子里，叫巴哈提的人很多，别的河床上，也有不少叫巴哈提的淘金人。巴哈提三个字，是哈萨克语‘幸福’的意思。”
    哦，巴哈提，愿黄金给你带来“巴哈提”！
