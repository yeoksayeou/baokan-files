In recent years, I have seen several reports from the CPC Central Committee in Hunan Province about General Tao Zhiyue's critical condition. General Tao's health has always been on my mind. Given his previous health condition, I had hoped he would live to be a centenarian, but I never expected that in recent years he would be bedridden and, at the age of ninety-seven, pass away. I am deeply saddened.

I first met General Tao in 1949 during the peaceful liberation of Xinjiang. After the First Field Army of the People's Liberation Army entered Xinjiang, General Tao led the Nationalist Party's Xinjiang Garrison to stage a rebellion, which was reorganized into the 22nd Army Group. The Xinjiang National Army was reorganized into the 5th Army. The three armies worked together to settle and defend the border. General Tao and I traveled throughout the Tian Shan Mountains, the Altai Mountains, and the Pamir Plateau, getting to know the various ethnic groups living in Xinjiang, familiarizing ourselves with the brave soldiers who had struggled to open up the land, and deeply appreciating the patriotic and heroic spirit of the broad masses of soldiers and people. We cooperated closely, had frequent interactions, and grew to understand each other deeply. I now recall some of General Tao's life events to express my deep sorrow.

General Tao was a young soldier who excelled in both military and literary arts. He had a high level of military theory, a wealth of historical knowledge, a love for classical Chinese poetry, and was skilled in calligraphy, earning him the title of "scholar-general." He was a typical general of the Chinese nation. In his early years, influenced by bourgeois democratic revolutionary ideas, he participated in the Xinhai Revolution, the Protection of the Nation and the Law, and later joined the first cooperation between the Kuomintang and the Communist Party in the Northern Expedition. After Chiang Kai-shek betrayed the revolution, he participated in the warlord conflicts and was forced to stand on the side of Chiang's reactionary rule for a time, but he sympathized with and supported Sun Yat-sen's revolutionary Three Principles of the People and the correct proposals of the Communist Party. When the War of Resistance against Japan broke out, he sincerely supported Chairman Mao Zedong's proposal for a united front against Japanese aggression, and was overjoyed at the second cooperation between the Kuomintang and the Communist Party. He often drew inspiration from the fearless spirit of anti-Japanese heroes like Qi Jiguang, anti-British heroes like Lin Zexu, anti-Russian heroes like Zuo Zongtang, and revolutionaries like Huang Xing and Cai E who followed Sun Yat-sen, and inspired his subordinates to fight bravely against foreign invaders with a spirit of certain death. Because General Tao was patriotic and anti-Japanese, he was stripped of his command several times by Hu Zongnan, who was favored by Chiang Kai-shek; but he was highly regarded by the patriotic Kuomintang general Zhang Zhizhong. He followed General Zhang Zhizhong into Xinjiang to serve as the Commander-in-Chief of the Xinjiang Garrison. He actively supported General Zhang Zhizhong's proposal for domestic peace and was deeply indignant at Chiang Kai-shek's tearing up the "Double Ten Agreement" and sabotaging domestic peace. During this period, General Tao also fully cooperated with General Zhang Zhizhong to release all the Communist Party members imprisoned in Xinjiang by Sheng Shicai, as instructed by Comrade Zhou Enlai. Under General Zhang Zhizhong's plan, General Tao made meticulous arrangements and dispatched a reliable officer from the Garrison Command Transportation Department to escort, with armed protection, the 130-plus Communist Party members and their families who had regained their freedom, overcoming numerous difficulties, to return to Yan'an. General Tao made a contribution to the Communist Party of China and to the Chinese people.

The most glorious page in General Tao's military career was in September 1949, when he responded to the great call of Chairman Mao Zedong and Commander-in-Chief Zhu De of the Central Military Commission of the Communist Party of China and the People's Liberation Army, resolutely breaking free from the shackles of the Kuomintang reactionaries, leading ten thousand soldiers to stage a peaceful uprising, turning weapons into plowshares, assisting the troops entering Xinjiang to advance smoothly, and planting the five-star red flag on the peaks of Kunlun, Pamir, and Altai. This made the border region, which accounts for one-sixth of the country's territory, an indispensable part of New China.

During the preparation for the uprising, General Tao received Comrade Deng Liqun, a liaison officer from the Central Committee of the Communist Party, who had secretly come from Yili to Di Hua, and dispatched his garrison troops to ensure the safety of the Communist Party's important personnel. Comrade Deng Liqun handed over a telegram from General Zhang Zhizhong to Tao Zhiyue and Bao Erhan, sent by Chairman Mao Zedong, and propagated the Party Central Committee's proposals and policies. General Tao expressed his determination to disregard personal safety and reputation, to be resolute and unyielding, and not to disappoint Chairman Mao Zedong's kindness and General Zhang Zhizhong's expectations. Ten days after the uprising, General Tao came from Di Hua to the then location of the First Field Army's First Army Group Command in Jiuquan, where he met with Commander Peng Dehuai and me. We are all from Hunan, and our conversations were especially warm. Although it was our first meeting, we talked freely and sincerely about national affairs and the world situation, just like old friends. General Tao introduced the process of the uprising, discussed the reorganization and reform of the uprising troops, and the important issues of welcoming the People's Liberation Army into Xinjiang. He repeatedly declared that the military would definitely defend the country and the people, ensuring that the country's territory would not be lost. He also mentioned his admiration for Comrade Li Xiannian's brave and arduous battles leading his troops to Xinjiang. During the conversation, General Tao showed great excitement and unusual emotion, saying, "This is unprecedented in my life." Commander Peng praised General Tao's heroic deed.

General Tao led ten thousand soldiers in the uprising, facing a complex situation, and was once obstructed and sabotaged by reactionary diehards. However, General Tao was brave and wise, turning danger into safety, and the uprising was successful. Under General Tao's command, there were three division commanders who were loyal to Chiang Kai-shek's reactionary leaders and advocated leading the main force out of the pass to defend at Xingxingxia, blocking the People's Liberation Army from entering Xinjiang. When they heard rumors of the uprising, they plotted several times to take violent action, attempting to arrest progressive figures around General Tao Zhiyue and Chairman Bao Erhan, creating ethnic separatism and turmoil in Xinjiang, and sabotaging the peaceful uprising in Xinjiang. At this critical moment, General Tao, with his extraordinary courage and wisdom, entered the lion's den alone, without a single escort, using love, hatred, right and wrong, and interests to persuade them. He spoke with righteous indignation, exposing the foolish dreams of the Kuomintang reactionary spy elements to sabotage the peaceful uprising, disarming them spiritually, and stabilizing the overall situation of the command leadership. Under the situation of the People's Liberation Army's brave and swift advance, these reactionaries placed their hopes on the remnants of Hu Zongnan, but they were quickly exposed by the broad masses of soldiers. In their state of fear and anxiety, General Tao immediately agreed to let them leave through the southern border, thus removing the last obstacle to the uprising and avoiding a disaster that would endanger the peace of the various ethnic groups in Xinjiang and the ten thousand soldiers of the Kuomintang.

Regarding General Tao's polite escort of the three reactionary division commanders, Ma Chengxiang, and more than twenty reactionary military and political officials out of the country, some people had criticisms and accusations after the uprising's success, saying that he had let go of counter-revolutionaries. General Tao felt wronged. Knowing this situation, I said in front of many generals to General Tao: This action is correct. Not only should it not be criticized, but it should be praised. I told a story of my personal experience: In the winter of 1939, during Chiang Kai-shek's anti-communist high tide, the 359th Brigade was ordered to move from the anti-Japanese base area in North China to the Shaanxi-Gansu-Ningxia Border Region's Suide area. At that time, the Suide magistrate was He Shao'nan, who was sent by Hu Zongnan. He was a "friction expert" who specialized in anti-communist friction. We fought against He Shao'nan with reason, benefit, and moderation, and he couldn't stay, so he fled. I ordered Deputy Commander Guo Peng of the 359th Brigade to guard the key pass and catch him. Guo Peng liked to play chess, and He Shao'nan escaped past his station while Guo Peng was playing a difficult game, resulting in He Shao'nan's escape. Later, I wanted to punish Comrade Guo Peng. Chairman Mao heard about it and humorously said to me: "You want to dismiss Guo Peng, and I want to reward him! If we catch He Shao'nan, we still have to feed him. If Chairman Chiang sends a telegram asking for him, we can't not send him. Can't we talk about a united front?" Although the situation was different from Guo Peng's letting He Shao'nan escape due to negligence, the strategy Chairman Mao talked about for fighting against reactionaries is the same. I told this story, and General Tao's sense of wrongdoing disappeared.

After General Tao announced the uprising, the Liberation Army had not yet entered Xinjiang, and some uprising soldiers, who had long been deceived by reactionary propaganda, were dissatisfied with the uprising and occasionally caused disturbances. General Tao did a lot of work to stabilize military morale. Once, General Tao spoke to the uprising soldiers, and some lawless reactionaries attempted to cause a riot in the venue. At this time, many people, for General Tao's safety, advised him to leave. General Tao, facing the serious situation, stood up straight and patted his chest, saying: If anyone wants to shoot, shoot at me! General Tao's selfless and fearless speech calmed the riot and stabilized the restless military morale, and prepared well for welcoming the Liberation Army to enter Xinjiang smoothly. When I led the main force of the People's Liberation Army's First Army Group to enter Xinjiang in late October, General Tao gave me a poem: "The general laughs and points to the Tian Shan Mountains, leading the spring breeze through the Jade Pass. In the vast desert, the red flag waves, and we welcome you with wine and joy." This is not a compliment to me personally, but a full expression of General Tao and the border soldiers' enthusiastic feelings for the Liberation Army.

General Tao's uprising troops, after reorganization and reform, were incorporated into the ranks of the People's Liberation Army and became the 22nd Army Group. General Tao Zhiyue served as the commander. In 1955, Chairman Mao Zedong, on behalf of the Party and the government, awarded General Tao Zhiyue the First Class Liberation Medal and the rank of Senior General. General Tao was extremely pleased.

Before the uprising, General Tao had agreed with the former deputy commander of the Xinjiang Garrison, Zhao Xiguang, that after handing over the troops to the Liberation Army, they would retire. After they came into contact with the Communist Party and the Liberation Army, they personally felt the Party's trust, and their thoughts and feelings changed greatly. They quickly gave up the idea of retirement and led the broad cadres and soldiers of the 22nd Army Group, along with the First Army Group and the 5th Army composed of the "Three Districts" National Army, to join the new battle of settling and defending the border, building the country, and settling down. A production boom of agriculture, industry, animal husbandry, and commerce swept across the vast Gobi Desert in Xinjiang, realizing his long-cherished wish of "soldiers defending the land with responsibility and deep camaraderie."

At the end of 1949, Chairman Mao Zedong issued the "Instructions on the Military's Participation in Production and Construction Work in 1950." The Xinjiang Military Region assigned the 22nd Army Group the task of reclaimed 200,000 mu of land in one year. In the ancient wilderness, where people were scarce, the nearly sixty-year-old General Tao led by example, sharing both hardships and joys with young ordinary soldiers, using primitive tools like hoes, plows, and pickaxes to open up wasteland, dig canals, and divert water. Through the hard work of the broad cadres and soldiers, General Tao's 22nd Army Group reclaimed 230,000 mu of land that year, exceeding the task assigned by the military region, achieving self-sufficiency or partial self-sufficiency in vegetables, meat, and grain, and winning the first battle of settling and defending the border. At the end of 1951, based on the successful experience of trial cotton planting in the Manas River basin, the Xinjiang Military Region proposed to the 22nd Army Group to plant 20,000 mu of cotton in the Manas Reclamation Area in 1952 and achieve a yield of 400 jin of cotton per mu. This was a bold yet scientific plan. To achieve this serious experiment, I, General Tao, and the Soviet expert Ditov, who was invited to Xinjiang to help with the work, and the deputy dean of the Xinjiang Agricultural College, Tu Zhi, signed a contract for division of labor and responsibility. I was responsible for ensuring the import of cotton seeds, chemical fertilizers, and political and ideological work from the Soviet Union. General Tao and the chief of staff were responsible for ensuring that the production contracting units delivered cattle, sheep, and other materials to the cotton fields on time, according to the agricultural calendar, for sowing and management. Ditov was responsible for technical guidance. The two former Kuomintang division commanders of the 22nd Army Group, Liu Zhenshi and Luo Zhenzheng, were responsible for ensuring the implementation of each technical item. Everyone signed and sealed the contract to show their solemnity. After the contract was signed, General Tao devoted himself to the struggle for high yield in large cotton fields. He, like an ordinary soldier, often attended the cotton planting technical training classes held by Expert Ditov and Professor Tu Zhi, and frequently went deep into the companies to inspect and supervise. Through the efforts of General Tao and the broad cadres and soldiers, a miracle appeared. The 20,000 mu of cotton planted in the Manas River basin yielded more than 400 jin of cotton per mu, creating the highest cotton yield per mu in the country at that time. Since then, the Manas River basin in Xinjiang has developed into an important cotton base in the country. At the same time, General Tao actively supported and participated in the construction of a new city on the banks of the Manas River in Shihezi, turning the originally sparsely populated place with only about 200 people into a new-type city with green trees, neat roads, factories, and comprehensive development of agriculture, industry, and commerce, known as the "Pearl of the Gobi." This is the glory of all the soldiers who settled and defended the border in Xinjiang, the glory of the 22nd Army Group, and the glory of General Tao Zhiyue. It is also the glory of the various ethnic groups in Xinjiang. In August 1954, the First Army Group, the 22nd Army Group, and the 5th Army were officially reorganized into the Xinjiang Production and Construction Corps. General Tao served as the commander of the Production and Construction Corps and invested even more energy in the great struggle of settling and defending the border.

Before liberation, Xinjiang had only a few small handicraft workshops and no modern industry. To develop Xinjiang's economy, the Xinjiang Branch and the Xinjiang Military Region mobilized all the soldiers in Xinjiang to tighten their belts, reduce military expenses, raise funds, and develop industry. General Tao contributed his long-term savings, handing over 1,000 silver dollars and several gold bars to the military region to purchase machinery and equipment. I was worried that this would make the original uprising officers difficult, so I persuaded him to take it back. He felt that this idea was considerate, so he asked me to keep it a secret. Seeing his sincerity, I accepted it. From this, we can see General Tao's enthusiasm for building Xinjiang and building the motherland. In his autobiography, General Tao expressed his views on money. He said: "The love of money is human nature. I am not against money. However, between reputation and money, one must weigh the importance and never forget righteousness for the sake of profit. In the old society, absolute integrity is non-existent. Sometimes a meager salary is not enough to maintain integrity. Even those who strive for integrity need to find ways to raise funds to cover necessary expenses. I consider myself to be one of those hypocrites. Looking back, I can't help but feel ashamed." I think General Tao was exactly with this mindset that he supported the construction of Xinjiang.

Before liberation, General Tao had twice been in charge of military affairs in Xinjiang. He had seen with his own eyes how the Kuomintang reactionaries trampled on the brotherly ethnic groups, and ethnic conflicts often occurred, bringing suffering to the various ethnic groups in Xinjiang. He had tried to stop ethnic separatism and maintain national unity. After liberation, when he led his troops to settle and defend the border, he often educated the troops to seriously implement the Party's ethnic policies, respect the customs and habits of various ethnic groups, and strive for ethnic equality and promote ethnic unity. He won the praise of the various ethnic groups.

While remembering General Tao Zhiyue's contributions to settling and defending the border and ethnic unity in the border areas, I also remember the late Second Political Commissar of the Xinjiang Production and Construction Corps, Zhang Zhonghan, Deputy Commander Zhao Xiguang, and Chief of Staff Tao Jinchu, as well as the cadres and soldiers who contributed to settling and defending the border. They made their contributions to the prosperity and strength of Xinjiang and the progress and unity of the various ethnic groups.

General Tao came from the old camp, was a high-ranking Kuomintang general, but he was always alert to the accumulated evils of the old society and the Kuomintang warlords and officials, and paid attention to self-reform. His noble character after joining the revolutionary ranks was deeply respected by people.

General Tao had a deep affection for the Party. During the time we worked together, what impressed me most was his serious study of the works of Mao Zedong and Marx, Engels, Lenin, and Stalin, often seeking advice from relevant scholars, and practicing what he preached. He had a special affection for the Party. He believed that following the Party, the People's Republic of China would prosper, and it would be the happiness of his descendants. In 1950, after participating in the first National Political Consultative Conference, he enthusiastically told me: Seeing Chairman Mao Zedong, Zhu De, Zhou Enlai, Liu Shaoqi, and Ren Bishi and other Party leaders on the stage, I was really happy. I remembered every word of their speeches and was determined to convey and implement them seriously.

Soon after the liberation of Xinjiang, in view of the fact that Comrades Chen Yun, Mao Zedong, Chen Tanqiu, Deng Fa, and Lin Jilu had successively worked in Xinjiang with remarkable results, and had cultivated a group of communists in Xinjiang, according to Chairman Mao's instructions, the Xinjiang Branch decided to immediately absorb them into the Party in batches. To facilitate the work in Xinjiang, the Xinjiang Branch proposed, and it was approved by the Central Committee, to adopt a special method to absorb a few qualified prominent figures into the Party. The so-called special method is that after joining the Party, there is no probation period, and after joining the Party, one can participate in the Party's various leadership organs as a committee member. Comrades Bao Erhan and Saifuddin Aizezi were among those who joined the Party at that time and participated in the leadership organs of the Xinjiang Party organization. At that time, I also talked with General Tao about his views on the Party and his personal wishes and considerations. He frankly talked about his past and some of his current understandings, revealing the political inferiority complex caused by his half-life of deviation. I understood him and encouraged him. In 1952, I talked with him again about the organizational issue. He sincerely said: "It is my wish, but I dare not ask. I do not dare to easily open my mouth to ask to join the Communist Party, but my determination to follow the Communist Party is unshakable." He took a serious attitude of self-discipline to deal with the issue of joining the Party. It was not until 1965 that he submitted his application to join the Party to the Party organization. Due to the subsequent ten-year turmoil, General Tao's application to join the Party was delayed. After the Third Plenary Session of the Eleventh Central Committee, he witnessed the prosperous scene of the motherland and, in 1982, applied to join the Party again, quickly obtaining the approval of the Central Committee and the Central Military Commission. General Tao's wish was fulfilled! I am happy for him.

In 1950, Chairman Mao Zedong, in his first meeting with General Tao, encouraged him to pass through three tests. Chairman Mao said to him: Study hard, reform yourself, and pass through three tests. The first is the test of the Liberation War, which has already passed and is very good; the second is the test of land reform, which will soon pass; the third is the test of socialism, which has not yet begun, and you should be prepared mentally. Chairman Mao's expectations for him, he kept them in his heart. General Tao, through his own efforts, passed the "three tests" and became a communist warrior. This is General Tao's highest honor.

Since the uprising, General Tao has always been in harmony with the Party, with loyalty and sincerity. His thoughts, his difficulties, and his suggestions could be shared with the Party organization. It was still in 1952 when the country began the "Three Antis" movement. At that time, there was a general sense of panic among the uprising soldiers because, in the old army, there were many dirty deals with money. He frankly talked to me about this situation at the right time. The Xinjiang Branch paid great attention to it and, after discussion, decided to draw a line in the original uprising troops during the "Three Antis" movement, and not to pursue any incidents that occurred before the appointment of political work cadres. This line was drawn, stabilizing the morale of the 22nd Army Group, and until the end of the "Three Antis," not a single "tiger" was caught among the uprising soldiers. Without General Tao's sincere communication, there would not have been this successful specific policy. This matter was later praised by Chairman Mao.

General Tao was upright and cherished the brilliant culture created by the Chinese nation and the excellent traditions of diligence, peace, wisdom, and thrift. He had great enthusiasm for the four modernizations of socialist China. He believed in truth, was clear about right and wrong, and firmly believed that human society would continue to progress. In 1952, the democratic reform and the production and construction of the Liberation Army in Xinjiang were subjected to unjust and rude criticism. In the political storm, General Tao was not intimidated by power and bravely insisted on seeking truth from facts and speaking fair words. Someone fabricated a story, saying that he, I, and the political commissar of the Production and Construction Corps, Zhang Zhonghan, were the "Three Sworn Brothers of the Peach Garden." He laughed it off, saying: I have always been a man of integrity. After liberation, as long as it is about patriotism and socialism, I can accept it. During the brutal persecution of old cadres by the Lin Biao and the "Gang of Four" counter-revolutionary cliques, he wrote several times from Changsha, sending poems, showing his open-mindedness in the face of major issues.

Comrade Tao Zhiyue was an outstanding member of the Communist Party and a high-ranking general of the revolutionary army that loves the country and the people. He led the Kuomintang army in the uprising and made great contributions; he was an old horse that did not retire, with an unyielding spirit, leading the Xinjiang Production and Construction Corps to create everlasting merits in settling and defending the border, which will be recorded in history.

We deeply mourn the passing of General Tao Zhiyue and will inherit his wishes, striving wholeheartedly to build the socialist China with Chinese characteristics proposed by Comrade Deng Xiaoping and the great cause of national reunification.

　　悼念陶峙岳将军
    王震  
    近几年，我几次看到中共湖南省委关于陶峙岳将军病危的报告，陶将军的病情一直牵着我的心。按照陶将军原来的身体状况，我曾期望他成为百岁老人的，但没料到近几年却身卧病榻，在九十有七之年，与世长逝，我很是感到悲痛。
    我和陶将军相识于１９４９年新疆和平解放之际。中国人民解放军第一野战军第一兵团进军新疆后，陶将军领导的国民党新疆警备起义部队，改编为第二十二兵团，新疆民族军整编成第五军，三支部队共同屯垦戍边。我和陶将军一起走遍了天山南北、阿尔泰山麓和帕米尔高原，结识居住在新疆的中华各兄弟民族人民，熟悉开垦奋斗的英勇将士，对广大将士、人民群众爱国建国的豪情壮志，都深感激励。我们合作共事，交往甚密，相知益深，现特记下陶将军的一些生平往事，聊表深切悼念之情。
    　　　　一
    陶将军少年从戎，却文武相济。他有较高的军事理论修养，又有丰富的历史知识，爱好古文诗词，也长于书法，有“儒将”之称，是一位较典型的中华民族的将军。陶将军早年受资产阶级民主革命思想影响，参加了辛亥革命、护国护法之战，随后又参加了第一次国共合作的北伐战争。蒋介石背叛革命后，参加过军阀混战，有段时间还被迫站在蒋氏反动统治一边，但感情上却同情、拥护孙中山先生革命的三民主义与共产党的正确主张。抗战军兴，他真诚拥护毛泽东主席提出的抗日民族统一战线的主张，为国共两党实现第二次合作而高兴，他常常以抗倭名将戚继光、抗英名将林则徐、抗俄名将左宗棠以及追随孙中山先生的黄兴、蔡锷等先烈的大无畏精神激励自己，并发扬所属官兵的爱国热情，教育部队怀着必死之志，英勇抗击外来侵略。由于陶将军抗日、爱国，被蒋介石宠爱的胡宗南几度夺了兵权；但却受到国民党爱国将领张治中的器重。他随张治中将军入疆，任新疆警备总司令。他积极支持张治中将军实现国内和平的主张，对蒋介石撕毁“双十协定”，破坏国内和平的行为深为悲愤。这期间，陶将军还全力配合张治中将军按周恩来同志嘱托，全部释放了在新疆被盛世才囚禁的共产党员。在张治中将军的筹划下，陶将军周密安排，选派可靠的警备司令部交通处长，武装护送重获自由的杨之华、马明芳、张子意、高登榜等１３０多名共产党员和家属子女，克服重重困难，返回延安。陶将军为中国共产党，为中国人民出了力、立了功。
    陶将军戎马一生中最光荣的一页，是他在１９４９年９月，响应中共中央军事委员会毛泽东主席和中国人民解放军朱德总司令的伟大号召，毅然摆脱蒋介石国民党反动派的羁绊，率领十万官兵，举行和平起义，化干戈为玉帛，协助入疆部队顺利进军，把五星红旗插上昆仑山、帕米尔和阿尔泰之巅，使占全国六分之一面积的边陲要地，成为人民新中国不可分割的重要组成部分。
    陶峙岳将军在酝酿起义的过程中，接待了从伊犁秘密来到迪化的中共中央联络员邓力群同志，并派自己的警备部队妥为保护中共要员的安全。邓力群同志面交了毛泽东主席发来的张治中将军给陶峙岳、包尔汉的电报，宣传了党中央的主张和政策。陶将军表示不顾个人安危毁誉，决心义无反顾，不辜负毛泽东主席的德意和张治中将军的期望。陶将军在举义十天后，就从迪化来到了第一野战军第一兵团司令部的当时所在地酒泉，同彭德怀司令员和我会见。我们三个都是湖南人，交谈中乡音未改，格外亲切。尽管是初次相识，大家像老朋友一样，就国事和世界局势等无拘无束、坦率诚恳地进行了广泛的交谈。陶将军介绍了起义的经过，商谈了起义部队的整编改造，以及迎接人民解放军进疆等重要问题，再三申明，军人决计保境安民，确保祖国金瓯无缺。他还谈到他对李先念同志率部英勇苦战转战到新疆极为感佩。交谈中，陶将军表现出无比兴奋和异常激动的心情，自称“这是生平之未有”。彭老总对陶将军的义举至为赞誉。
    陶将军率领十万官兵起义，矛盾错综复杂，曾经受到反动顽固派的抵制和破坏，但陶将军有胆有识，有智有勇，终于化险为夷，义举成功。陶将军警备总司令部属下有三名师长，死心塌地效忠蒋介石反动首领，曾力主率主力出关，在星星峡设防，阻碍解放军入疆。当他们风闻和平起义的酝酿消息后，几度密谋，准备暴力行动，妄图拘捕陶峙岳总司令和包尔汉主席周围的进步人士，在新疆制造民族分裂动乱，破坏新疆和平起义。在这千钧一发之际，陶将军以其过人的智勇，不带一员随从，只身入虎穴，以爱憎、是非、利害关系相劝，义正辞严，揭穿了国民党反动特务分子破坏和平起义的痴心妄想，解除了他们的精神武装，稳定了指挥首脑的整个局势。在人民解放军英勇神速进军的形势下，这些反动派把希望寄托于胡宗南残部的援助上，但又很快被广大官兵所识破，在他们恐惶不安的情况下，陶将军当即应允他们从南疆出境，这就排除了起义的最后障碍，避免了一场危及新疆各族人民安宁和国民党十万官兵的动乱灾祸。
    对陶将军礼送马呈祥等三名反动师长以及二十多名反动军政官员出境一事，起义成功后有些人颇有非议、指责，说是放走了反革命分子。陶将军感到委屈。我知道这一情况后，当着许多将领的面对陶将军说：这件事做得对，不仅不应受到指责，而且应该受到表扬。我讲了一段亲身经历的往事：那是１９３９年冬天，在蒋介石发动反共高潮时，三五九旅奉命从华北抗日根据地进驻陕甘宁边区的绥德地区。当时绥德专员是胡宗南派的何绍南。他是专搞反共磨擦的“磨擦专家”。我们对何绍南进行有理、有利、有节的斗争，他呆不下去了，被迫逃跑。我下令三五九旅副旅长郭鹏同志扼守要道把他抓住。郭鹏喜欢下棋，何绍南逃过其驻地时，郭鹏正下的难舍难分，结果让何绍南跑掉了。事后，我要处分郭鹏同志。毛主席知道后风趣地对我说：“你要撤郭鹏的职，我还要嘉奖他呢！抓住何绍南我们还得给他饭吃，蒋委员长来电要人，也不能不送，能不讲统一战线吗？”陶将军在反动师长交出部队领导权后把他们礼送出境，同郭鹏同志由于麻痹大意让何绍南跑掉，情况虽不一样，但毛主席讲的对反动派斗争的策略，其中道理是相通的。我讲了这段往事，陶将军的委屈情绪烟消云散了。
    陶将军宣布起义后，解放军尚未入疆，一些起义官兵由于长期受反动宣传的蒙蔽，对起义不满，骚乱时有发生。陶将军做了大量安定军心的工作。有一次陶将军对起义官兵讲话，有些不法反动分子企图在会场暴乱，这时许多人为陶将军安全计，劝其离开。陶将军面对严重事态，大义凛然，拍着胸脯说：谁要开枪，就朝我这里打吧！陶将军无私无畏的讲话，镇住了哗乱，安定了动荡的军心，并为欢迎解放军顺利入疆作好了准备。当我于十月底率人民解放军第一兵团大部队入疆时，陶将军曾有一诗相赠：“将军谈笑指天山，便引春风度玉关，绝漠红旗招展处，壶浆相迓尽开颜。”这不是对我个人的恭维，而是充分表达了陶将军和塞外军民对解放军的热烈感情。
    陶将军率领的起义部队，经过整编、改造，编入了中国人民解放军的序列，成为人民解放军第二十二兵团。陶峙岳将军任司令员。１９５５年，毛泽东主席代表党和政府授予陶峙岳将军一级解放勋章和上将军衔。陶将军无限欣慰。

    陶峙岳将军在举义前，曾与原国民党新疆警备副司令赵锡光相约，起义成功把部队交给解放军后解甲归田。当他们与共产党、解放军接触后，亲身感受到党对他们的信任，思想、感情上发生了很大变化，很快打消了引退的念头，率领第二十二兵团的广大干部战士同第一兵团以及由“三区”民族军组成的第五军一起，以奋不顾身的爱国主义、英雄主义的气概，投入了屯垦戍边、建国安家的新的战斗，新疆广袤的戈壁上，掀起了农工牧商的生产热潮，使他“军人守土有责，袍泽情深”的宿愿得以充分实现。
    １９４９年年底，毛泽东主席发出了《关于一九五○年军队参加生产建设工作的指示》，新疆军区给第二十二兵团下达了一年垦荒２０万亩的任务。在亘古荒原、人烟稀少的戈壁瀚海中垦荒，春寒似冬，冰雪未融，但年近六旬的陶将军，以身作则，与年轻的普通战士同甘共苦，用原始的砍土镘、土犁铧、十字镐，开荒造田，挖渠引水。经过广大干部战士的劳动，陶将军领导的第二十二兵团当年垦荒２３万亩，超额完成了军区布置的任务，实现了蔬菜、肉食和粮食的自给或大部自给，打赢了屯垦戍边的第一仗。１９５１年底，新疆军区根据玛纳斯河流域试种棉花成功的经验，向第二十二兵团提出在１９５２年玛纳斯垦区植棉二万亩，实现亩产籽棉四百斤的任务。这是一个大胆而又科学的计划。为实现这一严肃的实验，我同陶将军以及被请到新疆帮助工作的苏联专家迪托夫同志、新疆农学院副院长涂治教授签订了一份分工负责的合同。我负责保证从苏联进口棉种、化学肥料和政治思想工作，陶将军和参谋长负责保证生产承包单位将牛羊厩肥等物资及时运到棉田，按照农时下种和进行管理，迪托夫负责技术指导，第二十二兵团的刘振世、罗汝正两位前国民党师长负责保证每项技术的贯彻落实。大家都签字画押，以昭郑重。合同签订后，陶将军全力以赴地投入了争夺大面积棉田高产的斗争。他与普通战士一样，经常到由迪托夫专家、涂治教授举办的干部植棉技术训练班听课，还经常深入连队，检查督促。经过陶将军和广大干部战士的努力，奇迹出现了，玛纳斯河流域种植的两万亩棉花，亩产籽棉超过四百斤，创造了当时全国棉花亩产量的最高纪录。从此以后，新疆玛纳斯河流域发展成为全国重要的棉花基地。与此同时，陶将军积极支持和参与在玛纳斯河畔石河子小镇建设新城的工作，使原来只有二百余人口的小地方，按照规划逐步发展成为绿树成荫，道路整齐，工厂林立，农工商综合发展的新型城市，被誉为“戈壁明珠”。这是新疆全体军垦战士的光荣，是第二十二兵团的光荣，也是陶峙岳将军的光荣，是新疆各族人民的光荣。１９５４年８月，第一兵团、第二十二兵团和第五军番号取消，正式组成新疆生产建设兵团，陶将军兼任生产建设兵团司令员，他更加朝气蓬勃地投入了屯垦戍边的伟大斗争。
    新疆在解放以前，只有几个很小的手工工场，没有现代化的工业。为了发展新疆的经济，新疆分局和新疆军区动员新疆全体官兵，节衣缩食，紧缩军费，筹措资金，发展工业。陶峙岳将军倾长期的积蓄，拿出１０００元现大洋和几条黄鱼（金条），交给军区，用以购买机器设备。我担心他开了这个头，使原先起义的官兵作难，动员他收回去。他深感这种想法周到，就相请代为“保密”。我看他一片真诚，就收下了。从这里，可以看出陶将军对建设新疆、建设祖国的满腔热情。陶将军在他自述中，表示了他对钱财的看法。他说：“钱财之好，是人之常情，我非不好财也。不过在名誉与钱财两者之间，要权衡轻重，更不能见利而忘义。在旧社会，绝对廉洁是没有的，有时薄俸不足以养廉，即使以清廉自期者，也需巧立名目，寻求财源来弥补必要的开支。我以为自己也属于这种伪善者之流。抚今追昔，能不为之汗颜。”我以为，陶将军正是以这种心情，来支持新疆的建设事业的。
    陶峙岳将军在解放前，曾两度在新疆主持军务。他亲眼看到国民党反动派蹂躏兄弟民族，民族纠纷时有发生，给新疆各族人民带来的苦难，曾力阻民族分裂，维护祖国统一。解放后，他率部屯垦戍边时，经常教育部队认真执行党的民族政策，尊重各民族的风俗习惯，为实现民族平等，促进民族团结不遗余力。赢得了各兄弟民族的赞扬。
    在怀念陶峙岳将军的为屯垦戍边和边疆民族团结作出贡献的时候，我也怀念离世的新疆生产建设兵团第二政委张仲瀚同志、副司令员赵锡光同志以及参谋长陶晋初同志，怀念那些为屯垦戍边作出贡献的干部、战士。他们为新疆的繁荣富强，为各民族的团结进步作了自己的贡献。

    陶峙岳将军来自旧营垒，是国民党的高级将领，但他对旧社会国民党军阀官僚的积弊，时常保持警惕，注意自我改造。他加入革命队伍后的高贵品德，深为人们所敬重。
    陶将军对党有着深厚的感情。在我们共事的日子里，给我印象尤为深刻的是他极其认真地攻读毛泽东著作、马恩列斯著作，常常向有关学者请教，并且身体力行，努力实践。他对党有着一种特殊的感情。他认为，跟着党走，中华人民共和国才能繁荣，是自己世代的幸福。１９５０年，他参加全国第一次政治协商会议回来，曾充满激情地对我说：看到主席台上毛泽东、朱德、周恩来、刘少奇、任弼时等党的领袖，我实在太高兴了，我把他们的讲话一字一句记下来了，决心认真传达执行。
    新疆解放不久，鉴于陈云、毛泽东、陈潭秋、邓发、林基路等同志曾先后在新疆进行了卓有成效的工作，在新疆培养了一批共产主义者，根据毛主席指示，新疆分局决定立即分期分批把他们吸收到党内来。为了有利于新疆工作的开展，新疆分局提出，并经中央批准，决定采取破格的办法，吸收少数够格的头面人物入党。所谓破格，一是入党后不要候补期，二是入党后就可以参加党的各级领导机构当委员。包尔汉、赛福鼎·艾则孜等同志就是这时入党而又参加新疆党组织的领导机构的。当时，我也同陶将军交谈过他对党的看法，以及他个人的愿望和考虑。他充分、直率地谈了自己的过去和当时的一些认识，流露出由于半生歧路产生的政治自卑心理，我理解他，鼓励他。１９５２年我又同他谈过组织问题，他真诚地表示：“是所愿也，不敢请也。我不敢轻易启齿要求加入共产党，但跟着共产党走的决心是坚定不移的。”他以严于律己的郑重态度来对待入党问题，直到１９６５年，他才向党组织递交了入党申请书。由于不久开始了持续十年的动荡，陶将军的入党问题耽误下来了。党的十一届三中全会后，他目睹了祖国蒸蒸日上的兴旺景象，在１９８２年又一次提出了入党要求，很快得到党中央和中央军委的批准。陶将军的宿愿实现了！我为他高兴。
    毛泽东主席在１９５０年第一次会见陶将军时勉励他要过好三关。毛主席对他说：要好好学习，自我改造，过好三关。第一是解放战争关，现已过去，过得很好；第二是土地改革关，不久就要过去；第三是社会主义关，现在还没有开始，要有思想准备。毛主席对他的期望，他是牢记在心头的。陶将军经过自己的努力，过好了“三关”，成为一名共产主义战士。这是陶将军至上的荣誉。
    陶将军自起义以来，一贯与党相处无间，肝胆相照。他的思想，他的疑难，他的建议，都能与党组织交心。还是在１９５２年，全国开始了反贪污、反浪费、反官僚主义的运动。当时起义官兵中普遍有一种惶恐的情绪，这是因为在旧部队当官，在钱财上不干净的事是不少的。他适时坦率地同我谈到这个情况。新疆分局很重视，经过研究，从团结大多数出发，决定在原起义部队中开展“三反”运动时划一条线，在配备政工干部以前发生的事一律不予追究。这条线一划，安定了第二十二兵团的军心，直到“三反”结束，在起义官兵中没有抓一个“老虎”。没有陶将军的赤诚相见，就不会有这一成功的具体政策。这件事后来得到毛主席的赞赏。
    陶将军为人正直，对中华民族所创造的灿烂文化与勤劳、和平、智慧、节俭的优良传统非常珍重，对于社会主义祖国的四化建设具有极大热忱。他相信真理，是非分明，坚信人类社会必将不断前进。１９５２年，新疆的民主改革和解放军的生产建设遭受到不公正的粗暴批评，在政治风浪中，陶将军不慑于权力，勇于坚持实事求是，讲公道话。有人无中生有，说他同我以及生产兵团政委张仲瀚是“桃园三结义”。他嗤之一笑说：我生平是讲义的。解放以后，只要讲爱国主义，讲社会主义，我都听得进去。在林彪、“四人帮”两个反革命集团残酷迫害老干部时，他从长沙几次来信，赋诗相赠，表现出他在大是大非中的坦荡胸怀。
    陶峙岳同志是一位优秀的共产党员，是爱国爱民的革命军队的高级将领。他率领国民党军队起义有很大功绩；他老马伏枥，壮心不已，领导新疆生产建设兵团为屯垦戍边所创立的功勋是永垂不朽、丹青有著的。
    我们深切悼念陶峙岳将军，就要继承他的遗愿，为建设邓小平同志提出的具有中国特色的社会主义和祖国统一大业而竭诚奋斗。
