The statutes of the *Consultative Committee for the Basic Law of the Macao Special Administrative Region* have been formally drafted. The head of the drafting group, Ho Wai Wai, today introduced the situation regarding the drafting and revision of the statutes to reporters.

The preamble of the statutes specifies the nature of the Consultative Committee for the Basic Law of the Macao Special Administrative Region, stating that "it is a civilian consultative organization that serves as a link and bridge between the residents of Macao and the Basic Law Drafting Committee." The preamble also states that the Consultative Committee will "work in the spirit of democracy, cooperation, and openness, and with the principles of objectivity, comprehensiveness, and in-depth analysis, as well as the attitudes of democratic consultation, inclusiveness, seeking common ground while reserving differences, and not insisting on uniformity, to collect, organize, and reflect opinions and suggestions, preserving their objectivity, comprehensiveness, and representativeness."

The statutes consist of 15 articles, including the name, location, purpose, functions, working methods, members, term of office, standing committee, advisors, specialized subgroups, secretariat, meetings, amendment of statutes, funds, and dissolution of the Consultative Committee. Regarding the functions of the Consultative Committee, the statutes stipulate: "To collect various opinions and suggestions from people of all walks of life regarding the Basic Law; to reflect the collected opinions and suggestions to the Basic Law Drafting Committee for reference in drafting the Basic Law; to accept consultations from the Basic Law Drafting Committee." The statutes also stipulate that the number of members of the Consultative Committee shall not be less than 60 and not more than 100, with participation methods including: some being recommended or self-recommended by various sectors, invited to participate by the initiating meeting, and some being invited to participate as determined by the initiating meeting.

It is reported that the statutes had previously been published in newspapers for public consultation, widely soliciting opinions from people of all sectors in Macao. Based on this, the drafting group made multiple revisions before finalizing the statutes.
