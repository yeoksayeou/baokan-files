The 1988 Asian Top Ten Athletes selection results were announced today at a ceremony held at the Kunlun Hotel in Beijing. The event was organized by the Chinese Sports Journalists Association and the Chinese Hewlett-Packard Company. Ten outstanding athletes from the Asian sports scene were honored.

The ten athletes, representing six countries and regions, included seven who won gold medals at the 24th Olympic Games. Chinese gymnast Lou Yun and diver Xu Yanmei were named the top male and female athletes, respectively. Both won Olympic gold medals in their respective events.

The other athletes also had impressive achievements. They are: Olympic men's 100-meter backstroke champion Hitoshi Suzuki (Japan), Olympic men's singles table tennis champion Yoo Nam-kyu (South Korea), Weiqi (Go) player Nie Weiping, who won the Chinese Weiqi Saint title after numerous victories in the China-Japan Weiqi matches, WBA minimumweight champion Khaosai Galaxy (Thailand), Kim Soo-Nyung (South Korea), who broke the world records for the 70-meter round and individual round archery events and won the Olympic women's individual archery gold medal, Taekwondo 43kg class champion Chin Yuh-Fang (Chinese Taipei), Olympic women's singles table tennis champion Chen Jing, and Asian Swimming Championships women's 400-meter freestyle silver medalist Chong Sook Ling (Malaysia).

The organizers hope that next September, when the Asian sports elite gather in Beijing for the 11th Asian Games, more athletes will achieve even greater results, helping to narrow the gap between Asian competitive sports and the world's advanced standards.

Ten famous Chinese painters—Liang Shuyuan, Bai Xueshi, Yuan Xiaocen, Wu Xiu, Mi Jingyang, Xu Xi, Yuan Xikun, Shi Yu, Cui Senmao, and Wang Mingming—specially created paintings as awards for the athletes. Shi Yu was commissioned to create ten tiger paintings.

Wu Shaozu, Director of the State Sports Commission, and Zhang Caizhen, Deputy Director, along with some of the painters, attended the ceremony and presented certificates and awards to the top ten athletes. Officials from the Japanese, Thai, and Malaysian embassies in China accepted the certificates and awards on behalf of their respective athletes. The certificates and awards for the South Korean and Chinese Taipei athletes will be handed over through appropriate channels by relevant sports associations.
