The Soviet Procuracy recently held a meeting, ordering the transportation sector to undergo organizational reforms and severely punish theft and other illegal activities.

According to today's report by the *Sovietskaya Rossiya* newspaper, the Soviet Procuracy recently convened a meeting to discuss issues related to the protection of state property in Soviet foreign trade activities. The meeting revealed that the Soviet Union suffers annual losses and thefts of imported goods amounting to 1 billion rubles. Merely the identified substandard imported goods exceed 10 billion rubles, causing significant economic losses to the state.

The meeting pointed out that due to negligence by foreign trade units and other issues, over a year and nine months, 2,580,000 tons of substandard grains and grain products, and 9,400 tons of inferior meat were imported. Over two years, 30,000 tons of worm-infested cocoa beans were imported. The Mixed Goods Import Company failed to promptly request deliveries last year, resulting in foreign traders owing 4.4 billion rubles worth of goods.

During transportation, a large quantity of imported goods were lost or stolen. In just over a year and nine months, 6,000 tons of meat and 4,400 tons of vegetable oil were lost during the transition from sea to rail transport. The Ministry of Transport incurred losses of 6 million rubles due to stolen goods over a year and a half. Aid to the Armenian disaster area, including cars, prefabricated houses, and clothing, were stolen, with one-third of these incidents involving railway employees. The Soviet Procuracy demands organizational adjustments in the transportation sector and severe punishment for those involved in stealing imported goods.
