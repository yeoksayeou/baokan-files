European and American scientists have proposed a new theory on mass extinctions. According to Xinhua News Agency in London on January 13, scientists from the United States and Poland, through their research on sedimentary rocks, have proven that mass extinctions in Earth's history are related to the disruption of the carbon cycle.

Reports indicate that mass extinctions refer to periods in Earth's history when a large number of species suddenly went extinct in a short period. For example, 2.5 billion years ago, at the end of the Permian and the beginning of the Triassic, 96% of marine life was destroyed; 66 million years ago, at the end of the Cretaceous and the beginning of the Tertiary, dinosaurs and other animals were wiped out.

Scientists have discovered that these two mass extinctions share a common characteristic: the disruption of the normal carbon cycle in the ocean, leading to the disappearance of the gradient ratio of carbon-13 to carbon-12.

However, whether the mass extinctions are the cause or the result of the disruption of the carbon cycle remains to be further studied.

　　欧美科学家提出“大灭绝”新说
    据新华社伦敦１月１３日电  美国和波兰等国科学家通过对沉积岩的研究，证明地球史上的大灭绝与碳循环破坏有关。
    据报道，大灭绝是指在地球史上的某些时期，大量生物在短期内突然灭绝，如２．５亿年前二叠纪末迭造纪初曾毁灭了９６％的海洋生物；６６００万年前白垩纪末第三纪初曾毁灭了恐龙等动物。
    科学家发现，上述两次大灭绝有一个共同特点，即伴随着海洋中正常碳循环的破坏，碳１３同碳１２的比例梯度消失。
    但是，大灭绝究竟是碳循环破坏的原因还是结果，这个问题还有待研究。
