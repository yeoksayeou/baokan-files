Europe's Philips, Siemens, and Thomson, three major companies, announced on October 28, 1988, that they would jointly research future electronic components. Following this, the European Community Commission proposed that 12 member countries form a European company to research and develop high-definition television. On November 17, the commission approved 62 projects from the "European Information Technology Research and Development Strategic Plan," including many cooperative research projects in the electronics field. These developments indicate that the cooperation in Europe's electronics industry is accelerating, and confidence in catching up with the U.S. and Japan is growing.

Currently, in the fierce competition in the global electronics industry, European countries still lag far behind the United States and Japan. According to statistics, in 1987, Japan accounted for 48.6% of the world's total semiconductor sales, ranking first; although the United States' sales volume showed a downward trend, it still accounted for 38.8% of the world's total, while Europe only accounted for 10%. From 1980 to 1986, Japan's electronics industry grew by 120%, the United States by 28%, and France by only 16%. From 1976 to 1986, in the British electronics market, the annual growth rate of British products' sales was 2.6%, while Japan's was 7.6% and the United States' was 6.6%. What is more worrying for Europe is that the growth rate and turnover of some countries' electronics industries are declining year by year. Ten years ago, France's computer industry had an annual growth rate of 15-25%, but in 1986, the annual growth rate dropped to 4.8%, and in 1987, it further dropped to 2.1%. Its electronics industry's cumulative turnover for the first four months of 1987 was 4% lower than the same period in 1986. A British report pointed out that by 1991, British electronics companies' market share in the domestic market would be halved compared to 15 years ago. Although West Germany's electronics industry has developed rapidly and holds an important position in the world market for electronic components and robots, it is still unsatisfactory in integrated circuits and digital data processing. In recent years, the rapid development of high-tech industries in South Korea and Southeast Asia has also posed a potential threat to Europe's electronics industry. In the early 1980s, European experts lamented, "If this continues, Europe's electronics industry will soon be wiped out."

Europe has taken measures to protect its electronics industry. Since 1985, the European Community has imposed anti-dumping taxes on Japanese imports of electronic typewriters and electronic scales. In 1987, it imposed punitive anti-dumping taxes of 21%-35% and 20.6% on the components of these two products, respectively. In August of this year, the European Community Commission announced that it would impose temporary anti-dumping taxes on VCRs imported from two Japanese companies and three South Korean companies because the sales volume of these five companies in the Western European market had surged from 6.3% in 1985 to nearly 50%. Such measures can play a role in protecting the European market, but they are not the best strategy for developing Europe's electronics industry.

So, how to seek development in competition? From an overall strength perspective, Europe's basic research level is higher than Japan's, comparable to the United States', with more than twice as many researchers as Japan and more research funding than the U.S. and Japan. However, the obvious weakness in Europe's "each country for itself" situation is that: first, the enterprises are small in scale, not suitable for developing future cutting-edge technologies; second, the enterprises have limited funds, making it difficult to develop and research new technologies and products. European countries are increasingly aware that only by strengthening cooperation, concentrating efforts, avoiding repeated investments and mutual friction, can they enhance the competitiveness of European electronic products in the global market. Since the 1980s, Europe has formulated a series of cooperation plans in high-tech fields, including many cooperation projects in the electronics field, and the approved projects are being implemented at a rapid pace. A situation of promoting development through cooperation has formed in Europe. Siemens of West Germany and Philips of the Netherlands are carrying out a large-scale cooperation project with an investment of 2 billion dollars, aiming to compete with Japan in chip production. Siemens is also cooperating with France's Bull Company and Britain's International Computers Limited to develop advanced computers with 1 billion dollars over five years. European countries' enterprises, research institutions, and universities will also strengthen cooperation, turning scientific research results into popular products as soon as possible.

What further urges European countries is that the United States and Japan are also actively preparing to enter the 1992 European unified market. Several major Japanese electrical companies have directly invested in the European Economic Community countries, establishing factories serving the entire community. Major U.S. companies already have strong manufacturing and research bases within the community.

Facing the enormous pressure from the U.S. and Japan, Europe's electronics industry is speeding up its cooperation.

　　欧洲电子工业加快合作步伐
    木雅
    欧洲的菲利浦、西门子和汤姆森三大公司于１９８８年１０月２８日宣布，它们将共同研究未来的电子元件。接着，欧洲共同体委员会建议１２个成员国组成一个研究和发展高清晰度电视的欧洲公司。１１月１７日，该委员会通过了“欧洲信息技术研究与发展战略计划”中的６２个项目，其中包括许多电子领域的合作研究项目。这些动向表明，欧洲电子工业的合作步伐加快，赶超美日的信心增强。
    目前，在世界电子工业领域的激烈竞争中，欧洲国家还远远落后于美国和日本。据统计，在１９８７年世界半导体总销售量中，日本所占比例为４８．６％，居首位；美国的销售量虽出现下降趋势，但仍占世界总销量的３８．８％，而欧洲仅占１０％。１９８０年至１９８６年，日本电子工业的增长率为１２０％，美国为２８％，法国仅为１６％。１９７６年至１９８６年，在英国电子市场，英国产品的销售额年均增长率为２．６％，而日本是７．６％，美国为６．６％。更令欧洲忧虑的是，它的某些国家电子工业的增长率和营业额在逐年下降。１０年前，法国计算机工业年增长率达到１５—２５％，１９８６年的年增长率下降到４．８％，１９８７年又下降到２．１％，其电子工业１９８７年头４个月的累计营业额比１９８６年同期下降了４％。英国一项报告指出，到１９９１年，英国电子公司在国内市场上的份额与１５年前相比将减少一半。西德的电子工业虽然发展较快，电子零件和机器人的产量在世界市场上占有重要地位，但在集成电路、数字数据加工等方面还不能令人满意。近年来，南朝鲜及东南亚国家和地区高技术产业的迅猛发展，也对欧洲电子工业形成潜在的威胁。８０年代初，欧洲有关专家就曾慨叹：“如此下去，欧洲电子工业在不久的将来即将荡然无存。”
    欧洲曾采取措施保护电子工业。从１９８５年起，欧洲共同体对日本进口的电子打字机和电子秤征收反倾销税，１９８７年又对上述两种产品的零件分别征２１％—３５％和２０．６％的惩罚性反倾销税。今年８月，欧洲共同体委员会宣布，对从日本两家公司和南朝鲜３家公司进口的录相机征收临时反倾销税，因为这５家公司目前在西欧市场的销售量已由１９８５年的６．３％猛增到近５０％。此类措施可以起到保护欧洲市场的作用，但终究不是发展欧洲电子工业的上策。
    那么，如何在竞争中求发展呢？从整体实力看，欧洲的基础研究水平高于日本，与美国相当，科研人员超过日本一倍，科研经费也超过美、日。但是，欧洲国家各行其是的状况存在着明显的弱点：其一，企业规模小，不适于发展未来的尖端工艺技术；其二，企业资金有限，难于开发和研究新工艺、新产品。欧洲国家越来越意识到，只有加强合作，集中各方力量，避免重复投资和相互摩擦，才能增强欧洲电子产品在世界市场上的竞争力。进入８０年代后，欧洲制定了一系列高科技领域的合作计划，其中有大量关于电子领域的合作项目，已通过的项目正在加紧实施。一种以合作促发展的局面已经在欧洲形成。西德的西门子公司和荷兰的菲利浦公司正在进行一项投资达２０亿美元的大规模合作项目，打算在芯片生产方面与日本相匹敌。西门子公司还同法国的布尔公司以及英国的国际计算机公司合作，准备用５年时间以１亿美元资金发展高级计算机。欧洲国家的企业与研究机构和大学之间也将大力开展合作，使科研成果尽快转化为畅销的产品。
    更使欧洲国家产生紧迫感的是，目前美国和日本也在为打入１９９２年欧洲统一市场积极作准备。日本几家大电气公司直接向欧洲经济共同体国家投资，建立为整个共同体服务的工厂。美国的大公司已在共同体内拥有强大的制造和研究基地。
    面对美、日的巨大压力，欧洲电子工业正在加快合作的步伐。
