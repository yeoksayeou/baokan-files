How many vernacular novels are there from ancient and modern times in China? Recently, scholars from the Literature Research Institute of the Jiangsu Provincial Academy of Social Sciences informed reporters that they have collected 1,157 works. Vernacular novels have been the mainstream of Chinese novel creation since the Song and Yuan dynasties, and their sheer number makes it difficult to ascertain. To sort out and inherit this valuable historical heritage, the Jiangsu Provincial Academy of Social Sciences listed it as a key research project in the province's social sciences. Starting in 1985, the academy invited over 100 experts and scholars from 18 provinces and municipalities across the country to work for three years, completing the predetermined tasks and editing and publishing the book "General Catalogue of Chinese Vernacular Novels."

This book includes vernacular novels from the Tang and Song dynasties to the late Qing dynasty. The Tang dynasty was the embryonic period of Chinese vernacular novels, with the earliest works including "Dunhuang Transformation Texts." Later vernacular novels include "Romance of the Three Kingdoms," "Water Margin," "Journey to the West," and others. The late Qing dynasty had the most vernacular novels, accounting for about half of the collected works. The last vernacular novel collected in the book is "The Story of Guo Gong's Unjustified Grievance." The book also includes vernacular novels from ethnic minorities.

　　古、近代通俗小说数量初步查明
    我国古代、近代的通俗小说究竟有多少部呢？日前，江苏省社会科学院文学研究所的同志告诉记者，现已收录到１１５７部。通俗小说在宋元以后是我国小说创作的主流，其数量之多是很难查明的。为了清理和继承这笔宝贵的历史遗产，江苏省社科院把它列为该省社会科学研究的重点课题。从１９８５年起，该院邀集全国１８个省市的１００余名专家学者，历时３年，完成预定任务，编辑出版了《中国通俗小说总目提要》一书。
    这本书收录通俗小说的时间范围从唐宋至清末。唐代是我国话本小说的萌芽期，收入最早的作品有《敦煌变文》。以后的通俗小说名著有《三国演义》、《水浒传》、《西游记》等。晚清的通俗小说数量最多，占已收录数的１／２左右，收录的最后一部通俗小说是《带印奇冤郭公传》。本书还包括少数民族通俗小说。
