The Ministry of Communications recently issued a notice requiring local transportation departments to make early preparations and proper arrangements to ensure the safety and smooth operation of the Spring Festival travel season.

The notice points out that the 1989 Spring Festival travel season will begin on January 17 and end on February 25. Local transportation departments should, based on passenger flow forecasts, coordinate the allocation of vehicle and ship capacity, passenger routes, and stations and docks. They should also meticulously organize vehicle and ship dispatching, command, material supply, transportation, and transfer links.

The notice requires all transportation departments to improve service quality, strengthen ticket management, and handle ticket pre-sales and reservations. They should increase the number of ticket windows and extend ticket sales hours. For key enterprises and universities, they should organize door-to-door ticket delivery. During the Spring Festival travel season, while ensuring passenger transportation, all transportation departments should also actively cooperate with local commercial departments to handle the transportation and supply of festival goods.

The notice also requires all departments to conduct comprehensive inspections of vehicles and ships participating in the Spring Festival travel season, strictly prohibiting the operation of faulty vehicles. Special attention should be paid to the safety management of township passenger and ferry boats, as well as individual transportation vehicles.
