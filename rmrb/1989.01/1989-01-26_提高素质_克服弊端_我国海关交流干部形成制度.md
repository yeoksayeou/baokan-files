Positioned at the forefront of China's open-door policy and tasked with guarding the nation's gates, Chinese Customs has not only played an active role in promoting China's foreign economic trade and technological and cultural exchanges but has also actively and cautiously pushed forward reforms in its personnel system. It has explored methods for exchanging officials and initially formed a set of effective systems. This approach has strengthened the construction of the Customs team, overcoming the potential drawbacks of officials working in one place for too long.

Since the implementation of the open-door policy, China's foreign trade and technological and cultural exchanges have expanded, making the macro-control role of Customs increasingly important. The workload has become increasingly heavy, and the Customs team has continued to grow. The number of Customs units nationwide has increased by nearly half, and the number of personnel has doubled. Customs is a department that supervises imports and exports. How to improve the political and professional qualities of officials in the context of openness, resist corruption, maintain integrity, and correctly exercise the powers granted by the state is a very important and urgent issue. While advocating the "Customs consciousness" of guarding the country for the motherland, striving for glory for the nation, and being responsible to the people, promoting professional ethics and discipline, and focusing on the construction of spiritual civilization centered on clean governance, the General Administration of Customs has also taken steps to reform the personnel system. Since the nationwide Customs system was unified under central management in 1980, the exchange of officials has been implemented throughout the Customs system, gradually exploring various forms such as position exchange, intra-port exchange, system-wide exchange, paired exchange, and upward and downward exchange. Officials from the General Administration have periodically taken up posts or undergone training in various Customs offices, and officials from various Customs offices have also taken up posts in the General Administration. There have also been mutual exchanges and periodic assignments among leading officials of various directly affiliated Customs offices.

According to statistics, among the leading officials directly managed by the General Administration of Customs, 1/5 were exchanged within the national Customs system in 1988 alone. The scale of intra-port and position exchanges was even larger. Among the section-level officials in Guangzhou Customs, except for a few individuals, all have served in more than two positions. In early 1988, Beijing Customs exchanged 10 section-level officials and 11 deputy section-level officials. The busiest business unit, Kowloon Customs, has exchanged 1,037 officials since 1985, accounting for approximately 1/3 of the total number of personnel in the Customs. Those dispersed enforcement personnel with greater powers in key positions have been exchanged two or three times. Gongbei Customs also has 1/4 of its officials who have undergone exchanges.

Through the exchange of officials, various levels of officials have broadened their horizons, improved their business and policy levels, enhanced their abilities, and effectively avoided the potential drawbacks of staying in one place or one position for too long. Officials from the General Administration who have been exchanged to the grassroots level have enriched their grassroots work experience. Some officials from remote Customs offices have broadened their horizons and improved their scientific management levels after being exchanged to coastal Customs offices. Leading officials from coastal Customs offices exchanged to remote Customs offices have promoted the development of work in remote Customs offices.

Customs offices are spread throughout the country. Due to the significant differences in local conditions, climate, and living conditions, the exchange of officials to different places has brought many personal or family practical difficulties. While strictly requiring the exchanged officials to obey organizational decisions, the General Administration of Customs has, on the one hand, done a good job in ideological and political work; on the other hand, taken effective measures to help them solve practical difficulties. Many Customs officials, with a sense of the bigger picture, have overcome numerous difficulties to go to harsh places for exchanges, ensuring the smooth implementation of the official exchange system.

The General Administration of Customs and various Customs offices have formulated specific methods for the exchange of officials and have also stipulated comprehensive assessments of the situation of exchanged officials to continuously improve the effectiveness of official exchanges. While continuously improving the Customs official exchange system, the General Administration of Customs has also implemented a series of reforms, including the target management system for Customs directors and the probation system for section and deputy section-level officials, aiming to explore new paths in the reform of the personnel system to ensure the healthy development of the Customs team.

　　提高素质　克服弊端    
    我国海关交流干部形成制度
    本报北京１月２５日讯  新华社记者张毅、本报记者曹宏亮报道：位于对外开放最前沿、肩负着把守国门重任的中国海关，不仅在促进我国对外经济贸易和科技文化交往中发挥了积极作用，而且积极慎重地推进干部人事制度改革，摸索干部交流方法，初步形成了一套行之有效的制度。这一做法加强了海关队伍建设，克服了干部长期在一地工作可能产生的弊端。
    实行开放政策以来，我国的对外经贸和科技文化交往日趋扩大，海关的宏观监控作用日益重要，工作任务愈加繁重，海关队伍也不断壮大，全国海关单位增加了近一半，人员数量翻了两番。海关是进出口监督管理部门，如何在开放的形势下提高干部政治、业务素质，抵制腐蚀、保持廉洁，正确行使国家赋予的权力是一个极为重要而紧迫的问题。海关总署在提倡为祖国把关、为国家争光、对人民负责的“‘海关意识’、提倡职业道德”和职业纪律、狠抓以廉政为中心的精神文明建设的同时，着手从干部人事制度的改革上作文章，从１９８０年全国海关建制收归中央统一管理后，开始在整个海关系统试行干部交流，逐步摸索出岗位交流、关区内交流、系统内交流、对口交流、上下交流等多种形式，对各级领导干部和业务骨干进行交流。有总署机关干部定期到各海关代职或挂职锻炼，也有各海关干部到总署代职，还有各直属海关领导干部相互交流、定期任职。据统计，海关总署直接管理的海关领导干部，仅１９８８年就有１／５在全国海关系统进行了交流，关区内交流和岗位交流规模就更大了。广州海关现有的处级干部，除个别人外，均已在两个以上岗位上任过职，北京海关１９８８年初对１０个处级干部、１１个科级干部进行了交流。业务最繁忙的九龙海关，１９８５年以来交流干部１０３７人次，占全关总人数的约１／３，那些分散执勤且权力较大的重点岗位干部已交流了两三次。拱北海关也有１／４的干部已经进行过交流。
    通过干部交流，使各级干部开阔了视野、提高了业务政策水平，增长了才干，并且有效地避免了在一地或一个岗位上呆得太久而可能出现的弊端。总署机关干部到基层交流后，丰富了基层工作经验。一些边远地区海关的干部到沿海海关交流后，开阔了眼界，提高了自身科学管理水平，沿海海关领导干部到边远海关交流，则促进了边远海关的工作开展。
    海关遍布全国。由于各地水土、气候、生活条件差别很大，干部易地交流带来了很多个人或家庭实际困难。海关总署在严格要求被交流的干部服从组织决定的同时，一方面做好思想政治工作；另一方面采取有效措施，帮助他们解决实际困难。许多海关干部以大局为重，克服重重困难，到艰苦的地方去交流，保证了干部交流制度的顺利进行。
    海关总署和各海关都制定了干部交流的具体办法，还规定对交流干部的情况进行全面考核，不断增进干部交流的效果。在不断完善海关干部交流制度的同时，海关总署还实行了关长任期目标制、处科级干部见习制等一系列改革，力图在干部人事制度改革方面走出新路子，以保证海关队伍建设的健康发展。
