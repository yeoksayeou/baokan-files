Since 1984, public opinion polls have permeated various aspects of Chinese society. From the social psychology of reform and development, to the income levels of intellectuals, from price reforms, subsidies for daily necessities, housing issues, consumer electronics, to park fees, newspaper and magazine price adjustments...

How many units in Beijing are engaged in public opinion polling? There are no complete statistics. However, when Central Television held a bidding for a survey on viewership ratings in 1988, more than 40 units participated. The Urban Survey Team of the Beijing Municipal Bureau of Statistics, as the city government's survey agency, is undoubtedly one of the main units. They have a "thousand-household survey network" and a system of surveyors in Beijing's neighborhoods. In 1988 alone, they conducted 40 survey projects, the content of which, to varying degrees, are social hot topics. The reasons for their initiation are also largely due to the decision-making needs of government departments.

The Chinese Social Survey Institute first conducted a survey on domestic reform and development psychology and published the results in newspapers. At that time, it was an independent survey institution with more than 70 full-time workers and a nationwide survey network. However, it is basically a self-sustaining private institution. From February 1987 to March 1988, several "firsts" in China's public opinion polls came from the institute, such as the first street survey in Beijing immediately after the 13th National Congress of the Communist Party of China, which was filmed and reported live by Central Television.

The Chinese Social Survey System, affiliated with the Chinese Economic System Reform Institute, focuses on the periodic and continuous measurement and analysis of changes in social psychology. They are striving to track the complex process of social reform, conducting nationwide surveys twice a year to better serve the reform.

### 北京的民意调查

　　北京的民意调查
    自１９８４年以来，短短几年中，民意调查已渗入我国社会生活各个方面。从改革和发展的社会心理，到知识分子收入水平，从物价改革、副食品“明补”、住房问题、家用电器消费到公园收费、报纸杂志调价……
    北京有多少单位从事民意调查工作？没有完整的统计。但１９８８年中央电视台就收视率情况举行调查招标时，有４０多家单位前去投标。作为市政府调查职能机构的市统计局城市调查大队无疑是其中主要的一家。他们在北京有一个“千户调查网”和深入街道组织的调查员系统，仅１９８８年一年的调查项目即有４０项之多，其内容在不同程度上是社会热点，其立项原因也多在于政府部门的决策需要。
    中国社会调查所首次进行了国内的改革发展与心理调查并通过报刊连载将其结果公布于世的时候，它已是一个有７０多专职工作者和一套全国调查网的独立调查机构了。但它基本上是自负盈亏的民办机构。从１９８７年２月至１９８８年３月，有好几项我国民意测验的“第一”出自该所，例如第一次在党的十三大这样重大政治会议后进行北京街头的快速民意调查，并由中央电视台现场拍摄报道。
    隶属于中国经济体制改革研究所的中国社会调查系统，其最重要工作就是对社会心理的风向变化进行定期的连续性测量和分析。它们正力求跟踪社会改革的复杂过程，每年两次定期做全国性调查，以期更好地为改革服务。
