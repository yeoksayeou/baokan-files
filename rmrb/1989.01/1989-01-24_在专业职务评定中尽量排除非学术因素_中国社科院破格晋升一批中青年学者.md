In professional title evaluations, non-academic factors should be excluded as much as possible

    China Social Sciences Academy Promotes a Batch of Mid-Young Scholars

    Beijing, January 23 (Reported by Li Hongbing) - Yan Jiqi, Zhang Xianyang, Zhu Di, and Wang Yizhou, Lin Gang, He Xin, who have previously made their mark with their academic works on many young students' bookshelves, appeared on the list of 181 associate researchers and 450 deputy associate researchers promoted by the Chinese Academy of Social Sciences in 1988. They emerged under the principle of "equality, openness, competition, and selection of the best." The reporter learned this news today from the personnel and scientific research departments of the academy.

    Evaluating professional titles is a headache for research institutions, and it is common to see "one evaluation per year, one year per evaluation." However, the high-level professional title evaluation work started by the Chinese Academy of Social Sciences at the end of last October was completed in just over two months.

    Facing the new achievements in social sciences that are emerging both domestically and internationally, establishing a team of their own leading figures with strong academic capabilities has become an urgent task for the academy. It is said that in this professional title evaluation, they tried to exclude the influence of non-academic factors as much as possible, focusing on the academic, academic style, and academic ethics of professional personnel. For scholars with controversial academic views, they gave a realistic assessment. The evaluation results of the Academic Committee were fully respected.

    Just as the saying "The county party secretary is the best at farming" once circulated among farmers, the academy also had a history of the administrative department presiding over the evaluation of professional titles. To make the evaluation of professional titles regular, systematic, and standardized, the academy has delegated the approval authority for professional titles from the academy's personnel department to various research institutes. Each institute determines the proportion of various levels of professional titles according to the configuration of the academic team, and keeps it basically stable within three years.

    The academy also attempts to break the vicious cycle of "middle-aged people being delayed until old age, and young people being delayed" in the evaluation of high-level professional titles, and has promoted 22 professionals who, although their years of service do not meet the standard, have outstanding academic achievements. Among them, 8 are associate researchers, and 14 are deputy associate researchers. Li Hanlin, who is only 35 years old, became the youngest associate researcher in the academy due to his outstanding achievements in scientific sociology and other fields.

    A deputy secretary in charge of personnel at the academy introduced that they will establish a special file for leading figures in the discipline, and provide "special treatment" in terms of work and living conditions. In the evaluation of professional titles, they will gradually establish quantitative description-type evaluation standards and methods, striving to further reduce the interference of non-academic factors, especially interpersonal relationships. Because it was noticed in this evaluation that some scholars with deeper achievements failed to be promoted to the corresponding titles due to interpersonal relationship problems caused by their own reasons and others.

### 在专业职务评定中尽量排除非学术因素  中国社科院破格晋升一批中青年学者

　　在专业职务评定中尽量排除非学术因素    
    中国社科院破格晋升一批中青年学者
    本报北京１月２３日讯  记者李泓冰报道：曾经以他们的学术专著在许多青年学生的书架上站住了脚的严家其、张显扬、朱狄等和王逸舟、林岗、何新等分别出现在中国社会科学院１９８８年度晋升的１８１名研究员和４５０名副研究员的名单上。他们是在“平等、公开、竞争、择优”的方针下脱颖而出的。记者今天从该院人事和科研部门获悉了这一消息。
    评定专业职务是科研单位颇感头疼的一件难事，司空见惯的是“一年评一次，一次评一年”。然而中国社科院从去年１０月底开始的高级专业职务评定工作却在两个多月的时间内速战速决了。
    面临国内外社会科学层出不穷的新成果的挑战，建立一支自己的有雄厚实力的学科带头人队伍成了该院的当务之急。据称，他们在这次专业职务评定中尽量排除非学术因素的影响，着重考察专业人员的学术、学风、学德。对于有争议的学者的学术观点，给予了实事求是的评估。学术委员会的评审结果得到充分尊重。
    就像农民中曾流传过的“县委书记最会种地”的讽刺一样，社科院也曾有过行政部门主持专业职务评定的历史。为使专业职务评定经常化、制度化、规范化，该院把专业职务的审批权限由院人事部门下放到各研究所，由各所按照学术队伍人员配置的情况确定各级专业职务的比例，三年内基本稳定。
    该院还试图打破高级专业职务评定中“中年拖到老，青年给拖跑”的恶性循环，破格晋升了２２名虽年限未达标准，但学术成果卓著的专业人员，其中研究员８人，副研究员１４人。社会学所年仅３５岁的李汉林由于在科学社会学等领域的突出成就，成为该院最年轻的研究员。
    该院一位分管人事的副秘书长介绍说，他们将设立学科带头人的特别档案，在工作和生活待遇等方面“开小灶”。在职务评定中逐步建立定量描述式的考核标准和考核办法，力争进一步减少非学术性、特别是人际关系因素的干扰。因为人们注意到在这次评审中，确有一些造诣较深的学者，由于受本人原因和他人原因造成的人际关系问题的影响而未能评上相应的职称。
