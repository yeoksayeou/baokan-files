The U.S. housing construction industry experienced a downturn in 1988, making it the worst year since 1982. The U.S. Department of Commerce announced on the 19th that in 1988, the United States constructed 1.49 million new homes, a decrease of 8.2% compared to 1987.

According to U.S. housing experts, the rise in interest rates and the stagnation of personal real income growth were the primary reasons for the sluggish construction industry in 1988.

Last week, the U.S. mortgage loan interest rate had risen to 10.81%.
