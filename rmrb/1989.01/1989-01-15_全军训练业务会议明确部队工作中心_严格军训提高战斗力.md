The Whole Army Training Business Conference Clarifies the Army's Work Center
Strict Military Training to Enhance Combat Effectiveness

According to Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, January 14th - The whole army's training business conference, which concluded today, pointed out that in 1989, the People's Liberation Army must use enhancing combat effectiveness as the standard, making military training the center of the army's work, and improving the army's combat capabilities under modern conditions.

Military training department heads from all the major military regions, military branches, and the National Defense Science and Technology Commission studied and planned the 1989 military training work for the entire army. They discussed the new tasks facing military training in the new situation and realistically summarized the reforms in military training over the past few years. The conference believed that in 1989, it is necessary to genuinely make military training the center of the army's work, ensure that training is implemented, improve training quality, and enhance combat effectiveness. The following aspects of work need to be focused on: strengthening education on common regulations to promote standardized construction; focusing on basic technical and tactical training, especially laying a solid foundation for soldier training; strengthening in-service training for officers, particularly improving the training and leadership capabilities of grassroots officers; focusing on improving the overall combat capabilities of the troops, strengthening combined tactical training; focusing on implementing the military strategy of the new era, strengthening operational training, and currently focusing on operational training in important directions, key sea and air areas; focusing on the needs of real military struggles, strengthening training for border defense and garrison troops, and so on.

At the conclusion of the whole army's training business conference today, Chief of the General Staff, Dì Huódá, said that resolutely making military training the center of the army's work is consistent with the military commission's emphasis on the fundamental functions of our army and using enhancing combat effectiveness as the fundamental standard for military construction. Military training is the basic practical activity for enhancing combat effectiveness and is an important guarantee for fulfilling the army's fundamental functions. In the overall guidance of military construction, we must adhere to the "two fundamentals." In the specific practice of army work, we must adhere to "one center."

　　全军训练业务会议明确部队工作中心
    严格军训提高战斗力
    据新华社北京１月１４日电  （记者徐京跃）今天结束的全军部队训练业务会议指出，１９８９年人民解放军必须以提高战斗力为标准，把军事训练作为部队工作的中心，提高部队在现代条件下的作战能力。
    来自全军各大军区、军兵种、国防科工委的军训部长，研究和部署了１９８９年全军部队军事训练工作，讨论了新形势下军事训练面临着的新任务，实事求是地总结了近年来军事训练的改革。会议认为，１９８９年，切实把军事训练作为部队工作的中心，保证训练落实，提高训练质量，提高部队战斗力，要抓以下几方面的工作：抓好共同条令教育，加强正规化建设；抓好技术战术基础训练，尤其要打好士兵训练的基础；加强军官的在职训练，尤其要重点解决基层军官的练兵、带兵能力；着眼于提高部队的整体作战能力的需要，加强部队的合同战术训练；着眼贯彻新时期军事战略的需要，加强战役训练，当前要着重抓好重要方向、重点海域和空域的战役训练；着眼现实军事斗争的需要，加强边防守备部队训练，等等。
    总参谋长迟浩田在今天结束的全军部队训练业务会议上说，坚定不移地把军事训练作为部队工作的中心，与军委突出强调我军的根本职能和把提高部队战斗力作为军队建设的根本标准是一致的。军事训练是提高部队战斗力的基本实践活动，是履行军队根本职能的重要保证。在军队建设的全局指导上坚持“两个根本”，在部队工作的具体实践中就必须坚持“一个中心”。
