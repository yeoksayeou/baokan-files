Professor Yu Zhiheng and others from Hebei Medical College have overturned the international medical consensus that only low iodine levels cause thyroid disease through eight years of investigation and research. They have revealed the relationship between iodine and the prevalence of goiter, changing the traditional view that only low iodine levels cause thyroid disease.

Professor Yu Zhiheng and his team began their research in 1980. They traveled extensively, examining the thyroids of over 49,000 people in Hebei, Guizhou, and Shandong provinces, and analyzing over 1,000 urine iodine samples and 100 water iodine samples. They also conducted experiments on animals with low, adequate, and high iodine levels.

The results showed that the relationship between iodine and the prevalence of goiter follows a "U-shaped" curve, with both high and low limits. The safe range of iodine in water for human thyroid function is 5 to 300 micrograms per liter; the safe range of iodine in urine is 50 to 800 micrograms per day. When the iodine content in water is less than 5 micrograms per liter, or the iodine content in urine is less than 50 micrograms per day, it leads to low-iodine-induced goiter. When the iodine content in water exceeds 300 micrograms per liter, or the iodine content in urine exceeds 800 micrograms per day, it leads to high-iodine-induced goiter. Goiter occurring within the safe range of water and urine iodine is classified as sporadic goiter.

This theory has significant implications for the appropriate use of iodine in the prevention and treatment of endemic goiter. After its publication, it has garnered attention in the international medical community.

　　于志恒教授等推翻国际陈见    
    低碘与高碘都引起甲状腺病
    本报讯  河北医学院教授于志恒等人通过８年的调查研究，揭示碘与甲状腺肿流行的规律，改变了国际医学界认为“只有低碘才会引起甲状腺肿”的传统看法。
    于志恒教授等人的研究是从１９８０年开始的。他们跋山涉水，检查了河北、贵州、山东三省４．９万多人的甲状腺，化验１０００多份尿碘和１００多份水碘，同时做了“低碘”、“适碘”、“高碘”动物实验。
    结果发现，碘与甲状腺肿流行规律呈“Ｕ”形曲线关系，存在高、低两个界限。水碘对人类甲状腺的安全范围为每升水含碘５到３００微克；尿碘对人类甲状腺的安全范围为每日５０到８００微克。当水碘含量每升低于５微克，或尿碘含量每日低于５０微克，则引起低碘性甲状腺肿；当水碘含量每升高于３００微克，或尿碘含量每日高于８００微克，则引起高碘性甲状腺肿；在水碘和尿碘安全范围所发生的甲状腺肿，则属于散发性甲状腺肿。
    这一理论，对于在防治地方性甲状腺肿工作中适量用碘具有重要价值，发表后，在国际医学界引起重视。
