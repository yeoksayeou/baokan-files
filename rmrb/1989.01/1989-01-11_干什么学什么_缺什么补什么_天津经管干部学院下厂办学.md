The Tianjin Economic Management Cadres School adopts an open and multi-channel approach to education, organizing teachers to go to factories, adapting to the needs of enterprises, and conducting specialized training on "learning what you do and supplementing what you lack," which is highly appreciated by a wide range of enterprise cadres.

Economic department in-service young and middle-aged cadres urgently need intellectual development and knowledge updates in the wave of reform and opening up. However, they have heavy work tasks and family responsibilities, making it difficult to take long-term leave for study.

In response to this situation, the Tianjin Economic Management Cadres School teaches according to needs and flexibly conducts education. In the past three years, they have taken helping enterprises solve actual problems in economic management as their goal, actively sending out teachers to factories for teaching, and being practical and diverse in teaching content, training objects, and learning periods: some teach several courses such as enterprise management, industrial accounting, foreign trade, and network technology; some teach several chapters or sections of a course; it can be semi-detached or part-time study; some last for a year or half a year, and some for a few months, weeks, or days; they teach not only existing textbooks but also public relations, contract system, shareholding system, optimization combination, as well as rectification and rectification of actual problems, achieving quick results in improving economic benefits and improving the quality of cadres.

For a long time, a pharmaceutical company has been troubled by poor economic benefits. With the help of the school, it organized specialized training on "feasibility study" and "target management," promoting the transformation from loss to profit.

The experienced but knowledge-structure-imbalanced middle-level cadres of Tianjin Alkali Plant improved their management level and quality awareness through learning, making the enterprise rank among the top in Tianjin's industry.

Last year, 360 teachers and staff of this school trained more than 5,000 students, with each teacher training an average of 18 people, achieving remarkable results.

　　干什么学什么　缺什么补什么
    天津经管干部学院下厂办学
    本报天津电  记者肖荻报道：天津市经济管理干部学院开放式、多渠道办学，组织教师走出校门下厂，适应企业需要，开展“干什么学什么、缺什么补什么”的专题培训，深受广大企业干部欢迎。
    经济部门的在职中青年干部，在改革、开放的大潮中迫切需要智力开发和知识更新，但工作任务和家务负担都很繁重，长期脱产学习困难甚多。
    针对这一情况，天津经济管理干部学院按需施教，灵活办学。近３年来，他们以帮助企业解决经营管理中的实际问题为目的，主动派出教师，下厂办学，在教学内容、培训对象、学习期限上求实、多样：有的讲企业管理、工业会计、外经外贸、网络技术等几门课，有的讲一门课的几章、几节；可以是半脱产，也可以是业余学习；有的是一年、半年，也有几月、几周、几天；既讲现行教材，也讲公共关系、承包制、股份制、优化组合，以及治理、整顿等现实问题，在提高经济效益和改善干部素质上收效很快。
    长期以来为经济效益差而苦恼的制药公司，在学院帮助下举办了“可行性研究”、“目标管理”等专题培训，促进了扭亏为盈。
    经验丰富但知识结构欠合理的天津碱厂中层干部，在学习中提高了管理水平和质量意识，使企业跃居天津工业界前列。
    去年，这个学院的３６０位教职员培训出５０００多学员，每个教师平均培训１８名，效益可观。
