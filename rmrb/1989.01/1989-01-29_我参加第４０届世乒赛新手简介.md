She has good physical fitness and fights tenaciously on the court.

Li Jun, a 20-year-old Beijing player, is often referred to as the "tiger daughter of a general." Her mother is the famous Chinese table tennis player Ye Peiqiong, who won the first National Games women's singles championship. Li Jun's playing style is similar to her mother's, using a right-hand horizontal grip with a chopping style. She is agile on her feet and tenacious on the court.

**Men's Team:**

Chen Zhibin, originally from Xinjiang and later joined the Beijing team, was born in 1962. Like Xu Zengcai, he is considered a late bloomer.
