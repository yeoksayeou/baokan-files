East Germany and Poland have made progress in negotiations over the demarcation of the waters of the Oder Bay. According to a report by the Deutsche Nachrichtenagentur, experts from both countries held talks in Berlin from December 28 to 29, 1988, discussing specific issues such as the demarcation of maritime boundaries, fishing zones, and the continental shelf, as well as ensuring the free passage of deep-draft vessels to the Polish ports of Szczecin and Świnoujście. Both sides have moved closer in their positions and agreed to continue negotiations to expedite the drafting of a treaty.

The news of the negotiations between the two countries over the demarcation of the waters of the Oder Bay was confirmed by the Polish side in August 1987. However, the differences between the two countries on this issue arose after they both declared a 12-nautical-mile territorial sea.

　　民德波兰举行奥得湾水域谈判
    民主德国和波兰在奥得湾水域边界划分问题上的谈判取得进展。据德通社报道，两国专家一九八八年十二月二十八日至二十九日在柏林进行谈判，讨论了水域边界、捕鱼区和大陆架的划分以及保证深水位船只通向波兰港口什切青和希维诺乌伊希切的自由通行权等具体问题，双方立场有所接近，并商定继续进行谈判，加快制订条约的工作。
    两国关于奥得湾水域边界划分谈判的消息是波兰方面于一九八七年八月证实的，但双方在这一问题上的分歧是随着两国宣布十二海里领海权而出现的。
