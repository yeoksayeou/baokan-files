Auspicious Snow Portends a Bountiful Year

Snow Falls in Major Grain-Producing Regions

According to Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, January 5th — The first snow of 1989 fell in Beijing this morning.

Vice Premier Tian Jiyun, who oversees agriculture, was in a particularly good mood today. During a morning meeting of the State Council's Water Resources and Soil Conservation Leading Group, he pointed to the snowflakes falling outside the window and said, "This snow is falling at the right time! Snowfall means grain!" This remark brought laughter from the attendees.

When someone reported at the meeting that a shortage of water resources was constraining agricultural development, Tian Jiyun took out a telephone record he had just received and told everyone: Beijing, Henan, Hebei, Hubei, Hunan, Guangxi, Guangdong, Shaanxi, Shanxi, Sichuan, and Yunnan have all seen rain and snow. Rain and snow falling in grain-producing regions remind one of the saying, "Auspicious snow portends a bountiful year."

Since last October, rainfall has been scarce in most parts of the country, and many people have been worried about agricultural production in 1989.

The Central Meteorological Observatory provided information at 16:30 today stating that from January 3rd to today, regions in Shaanxi, Shanxi, Hebei, eastern Shandong, northern Henan, and other areas that have experienced continuous drought since autumn have seen moderate to heavy snowfall. The western and central parts of the Huang-Huai region, western Jianghuai, and Jiangnan have received 5 to 20 millimeters of rain. The southern and eastern parts of Guangxi, the western and northern parts of Guangdong have seen moderate to heavy rain, with some areas experiencing 50 to 70 millimeters of torrential rain. The drought in these regions is expected to ease.

The Central Meteorological Observatory forecasts that from today to tomorrow, there will be widespread snowfall or rainfall in the central and southern parts of North China, Huang-Huai, Jianghuai, Jiangnan, and South China. The amount of precipitation in the winter wheat region and the drought-affected areas of eastern Huang-Huai, eastern Jianghuai, and the lower reaches of the Yangtze River is expected to be between 3 and 15 millimeters.

　　瑞雪兆丰年
    我国主要产粮区普降雨雪
    据新华社北京１月５日电  （记者张建军）今晨北京降下１９８９年第一场雪。
    分管农业的田纪云副总理今天显得十分高兴。他在上午主持国务院水资源与水土保持领导小组会议时，指着窗外纷纷飘落的雪花说：“这场雪下得好！下雪就是下粮食呀！”引起与会者一阵欢快的笑声。
    当会上有人汇报到水资源紧缺制约农业发展时，田纪云拿出一份刚刚收到的电话记录告诉人们：北京、河南、河北、湖北、湖南、广西、广东、陕西、山西、四川、云南等地普降雨雪。雨雪降在产粮区，使人想起瑞雪兆丰年的谚语。
    去年１０月以来，我国大部地区降水稀少，许多人开始为１９８９年的农业生产担忧。
    中央气象台今天１６点３０分提供的消息说，本月３日至今天，秋冬连旱的陕西、山西、河北、山东西部、河南北部等地普降中到大雪，黄淮西部和中部、江淮西部、江南降下５至２０毫米的雨，广西南部和东部、广东西部和北部下了１０至３０毫米的中到大雨，局部地区下了５０至７０毫米的暴雨。这些地区的旱象可望得到缓解。
    中央气象台预计，今天到明天，华北地区中部和南部、黄淮、江淮、江南、华南还将有大范围的降雪或降雨，其中冬麦区及干旱的黄淮东部、江淮东部、长江下游的降水量将在３至１５毫米之间。
