Title: Tensions Rise Again in U.S.-Libya Relations

Recent events have led to a renewed tension in relations between the United States and Libya. Two incidents in particular have drawn attention: on January 4, two U.S. F-14 fighter jets shot down two Libyan MiG fighter jets in international airspace over the Mediterranean; and over a period of time, the U.S. has publicly accused Libya of constructing a large-scale factory for the production of chemical weapons, demanding that Libya dismantle the facility, while Libya insists it is a pharmaceutical plant and rejects the U.S. accusations. These two incidents have sparked significant reactions both in the U.S. and internationally.

The news of the U.S. shooting down Libyan fighter jets caused quite a stir. The U.S. government, in an effort to explain the circumstances, immediately held a press conference with the Secretary of Defense, stating that the U.S. action was "in self-defense" and that the U.S. considered the incident to be resolved. However, Libya's Foreign Ministry issued a statement accusing the U.S. of a "premeditated attack" and immediately called for an emergency meeting of the United Nations Security Council to discuss the incident. Although the shooting down of the jets has not yet visibly worsened the situation in the Mediterranean, its impact remains to be seen. Some Arab officials have expressed concern that this conflict could jeopardize the Middle East peace process and have negative consequences. Western European countries have also expressed deep concern, hoping that the tense situation will not escalate in the Mediterranean.

The question of whether the U.S. shooting down of Libyan jets is related to recent U.S. accusations against Libya for producing chemical weapons has been a topic of much speculation in the U.S. media. The U.S. has long raised objections to a large chemical plant in Libya, located about 60 kilometers southwest of Tripoli in Rabta, believing that the plant is "close to full-scale production of chemical weapons," which the U.S. cannot tolerate. To this end, the U.S. has conducted a series of diplomatic activities aimed at pressuring Libya to stop the production of the plant. According to recent reports in U.S. newspapers, as early as one or two months ago, the U.S. had informed Western European allies and the Soviet Union of its views on the Libyan plant. When West German Chancellor Kohl visited Washington in mid-November last year, U.S. leaders informed the West German leadership that West German companies had played a "key role" in helping to build the Libyan plant. Subsequently, the U.S. provided further intelligence to Western European allies, showing satellite photos to support its arguments. In early December, when Gorbachev visited New York, the U.S. also discussed the matter with the Soviet side, urging the Soviet Union to persuade Libya to stop construction. The prohibition of chemical weapons is a common requirement of the international community, but in specific cases, Western Europe has been cautious in its stance. On the one hand, there is considerable disagreement over whether the Libyan plant produces chemical weapons. According to the New York Times, with the exception of Britain, which largely accepts the U.S. view, other Western European allies have expressed varying degrees of skepticism about the U.S. accusations, believing that more evidence is needed. West Germany, for its part, has informed the U.S. that, according to official investigations, West German companies have not violated export restrictions to Libya. However, the U.S. has insisted on its position, stating that it has intelligence indicating that Libya has already produced small quantities of chemical weapons. On the other hand, Western European allies are concerned about the possibility of the U.S. taking unilateral military action. It is noted that two weeks ago, President Reagan, in an interview with reporters, said that the U.S. does not rule out the possibility of taking military action to destroy the Libyan chemical weapons plant. Although Reagan recently stated that he does not support military action against the Libyan plant to avoid "international uproar" and harming broader U.S. interests, Western Europe has not linked the shooting down of the jets to U.S. threats against Libya. However, the jet incident has undoubtedly cast a shadow over the allies' minds, with concerns that the U.S. might take military action against the Libyan plant, "repeating the 1986 military strike against Libya."

Looking at U.S.-Libya relations, the two sides have had a history of mutual accusations and direct conflicts over the past decade. Since December 1979, there have been multiple incidents of mutual accusations and direct confrontations, including the U.S. F-14 jet shooting down two Libyan SU-22 military aircraft in August 1981, Libya's missile attacks on U.S. aircraft in March and April 1986, and the U.S. retaliatory actions, including missile strikes on Libyan missile bases and air raids on Tripoli. Western Europeans do not want to see this state of hostility continue, so in the matter of the Libyan chemical plant, Italy has suggested that the U.S. accept Libya's proposal for an inspection of the plant, and on January 4, West Germany also proposed to Libya that it accept international inspections. It is reported that two weeks ago, Saudi Arabia also proposed to mediate U.S.-Libya relations. However, from the current situation, the message from the U.S. is that it wants to prevent the spread of chemical weapons as a policy priority. Regarding the Libyan plant, it insists that it is a chemical weapons production facility and is therefore unacceptable and must be dismantled, and is continuing diplomatic efforts for this purpose. Therefore, for the time being, U.S.-Libya relations will not ease.

　　又趋紧张的美利关系
    本报记者  张启昕
    由于最近接连发生的事件，美国和利比亚的关系再度紧张起来，一是１月４日，美国两架Ｆ—１４战斗机在地中海国际水域上空击落利比亚两架米格战斗机；二是一个时期来美国公开指责利比亚建造生产化学武器的大型工厂，要求利比亚拆除这家工厂，而利比亚则称这是一家生产药品的工厂，拒绝美国的指控。这两个事件在美国和国际上引起巨大反响。
    美国击落利比亚战斗机的消息传来，这里颇为震动。美国政府为了解释事件缘由，立即由国防部长出面举行记者招待会，说美国的行动是“出于自卫”，并称美国认为，这一突发事件已经了结。然而利比亚外交部则发表声明指责美国击落利比亚飞机是“有预谋的攻击”，并立即要求联合国安理会举行紧急会议讨论这一事件。目前，击落飞机事件虽然未明显引起地中海局势的进一步恶化，但其影响如何尚难判断。阿拉伯国家的一些人士称，这一冲突可能危及中东和平进程，产生不利影响。西欧一些国家对此深表关切，希望紧张局面不要在地中海升级。
    美国击落利比亚飞机是否同美国近时指责利比亚生产化学武器有所联系，这是美国舆论界纷加猜测的问题。美国对利比亚在首都的黎波里西南６０公里的拉布塔建造的大型化工厂，早就提出异议，认为这家工厂“接近于全面生产化学武器”，美国不能容忍这一事态。为此，美国在外交上开展了一系列活动，意在对利比亚施加压力，阻止这家工厂投入生产。据美国报纸近日来报道，早在一二个月之前，美国就先后向西欧盟国和苏联通报了美国对利比亚工厂的看法。当去年１１月中旬西德总理科尔访问华盛顿时，美国领导人向西德领导人通报，在帮助建造利比亚这家工厂中，西德的公司起了“关键作用”。随后美国又向西欧盟国进一步提供情报，出示卫星照片，说明美国的论点。而在１２月上旬戈尔巴乔夫访问纽约时，美方也向苏联方面谈论了此事，要苏联劝利比亚停建。禁止化学武器本是国际社会共同的要求，但在具体事件上，西欧表态谨慎。一是它们对利比亚的工厂是否生产化学武器颇有争议。据《纽约时报》报道，对于美国提出的指控，除英国大体上接受美国的看法外，西欧其他盟国都表示不同程度的怀疑，认为需要有更多的证据。西德则向美国说明，根据西德官方的调查，西德公司并未违反对利比亚出口的限制。但美国坚持自己的论点，并称美国有情报说明，利比亚已经生产了小批量的化学武器。其次是西欧盟国担心美国贸然采取军事行动。人们注意到，在两周前，里根总统在接受记者采访时曾经说过，美国并不排除采取军事行动以摧毁利比亚化学武器工厂的可能性。虽然最近里根又说，他并不赞成对利比亚工厂采取军事行动，以免引起“国际喧嚣”，损害美国更广泛的利益。西欧也没有把击落飞机事件与美国威胁利比亚的言论相提并论。但是，飞机事件无疑使盟国心理上蒙上一层阴影，“担心美国可能对利比亚工厂采取军事行动”，“重演１９８６年对利比亚军事袭击事件”。
    从美利关系看，近年来双方交恶匪浅。从１９７９年１２月以来的近１０年间，美利相互指责和直接冲突的事件出现多次，其中包括１９８１年８月美国Ｆ—１４飞机击落利比亚两架ＳＵ—２２军用机，１９８６年３、４月间利比亚导弹袭击美国飞机以及美国采取报复行动，袭击利比亚导弹基地和轰炸的黎波里。西欧人不愿看到这种敌对状态长此下去，因此在利比亚化工厂一事上，意大利曾建议美国接受利比亚提出的对工厂作一次检查的建议，１月４日西德又向利比亚建议接受国际检查。据称，两周前沙特阿拉伯也曾提出调解美利关系。但从目前看，美国传出的信息是，它想把防止化学武器扩散作为政策重点之一。对于利比亚的工厂，它坚持认为是生产化学武器的，因而是不能接受的，是必须加以拆除的，并正在继续为此进行外交活动。因此，一时间美利关系还不会缓解。
