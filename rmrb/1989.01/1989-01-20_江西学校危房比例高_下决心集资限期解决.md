Jiangxi schools have a high proportion of dilapidated buildings. The province has resolved to raise funds to address the issue within a set timeframe.

According to a report from our newspaper, Jiangxi Province has raised more than 200 million yuan through various levels of fiscal allocations and multiple funding channels for education. Last year, the province constructed 29 million square meters of school buildings, of which 18.5 million square meters were completed. The proportion of dilapidated buildings has decreased, but it still accounts for 7.6% of the total building area, which is higher than the national average.

To quickly address the issue of dilapidated buildings in primary and secondary schools, Jiangxi Province will continue to allocate a certain proportion of funds from various levels of fiscal budgets. Starting this year, the education surcharge rate will be increased from 1% to 2%. In addition to national key construction projects and those in energy, transportation, agriculture, and education, all departments and units will be required to contribute 5% of their annual construction investment to the construction of primary and secondary school buildings. For projects related to buildings and facilities, a 10% contribution will be required. For government agencies, organizations, and enterprises purchasing 29 types of controlled commodities as stipulated by the state, an additional fee will be levied to repair primary and secondary school buildings. For the purchase of imported cars, both planned and unplanned, additional fees of 15% and 30% will be levied, respectively. For color televisions, refrigerators, washing machines, air conditioners, video recorders, premium cigarettes, and premium liquor, an additional fee of 50% of the purchase price will be levied. The additional fees for these controlled commodities and the banquet tax levied in restaurants, banquet halls, hotels, and reception centers will all be used before the end of 1990 to repair primary and secondary school buildings and improve educational conditions.

　　江西学校危房比例高
    下决心集资限期解决
    本报讯  江西省通过各级财政拨款和多渠道集资办学，去年共筹集２亿多元，修建校舍２９０多万平方米，其中竣工面积１８５万平方米，危房比例有所下降。但危房仍占校舍总面积的７．６％，高于全国平均数。
    为了尽快解决中小学校危房，江西省除各级财政要继续安排一定比例的专款，决定今年起征收的教育经费附加率，由１％提高为２％。除国家重点建设及能源、交通、农业、教育项目外，各部门、各单位均按年度基建投资总额的５％征收中小学校舍修建附加费。属于楼堂馆所项目的征收１０％。对各机关、团体、企事业单位购买国家规定的２９种专控商品，则征收附加费用于抢修中小学危房，其中购买进口小汽车，计划内和计划外分别按１５％和３０％征收附加费，彩电、冰箱、洗衣机、空调器、录像机、名烟、名酒按购价的５０％征收附加费。上述专控商品附加费和在饭店、酒楼、宾馆、招待所等饮食营业场所征收的筵席税，在１９９０年前全部用作抢修中小学危房和改善办学条件。
