Hu Quyuan, in an article published in *Wen Hui Bao* (December 20, 1988), pointed out that the so-called fundamental problem of philosophy, on one hand, is to address the issue of whether thought or existence is the primary origin; on the other hand, it is to address the issue of the mutual relationship between thought and existence, that is, whether they can be consistent. Even if a philosopher emphasizes that nature is the origin of the world, if his thoughts and actions do not align with objective reality, what significance does that have? Whether a philosophical thought is correct does not entirely depend on whether it belongs to the camp of idealism or materialism, but rather on whether it can truly solve the mutual relationship between thought and existence, grasp objective reality, and make judgments and decisions that align with objective reality. This means that the true task of philosophy lies in the second aspect of the fundamental problem of philosophy, not the first. The first aspect is merely a theoretical premise for the second aspect, explaining the different processes by which thought and existence serve as theoretical foundations in the realm of philosophy. It does not require or solve the contradictions that exist between thought and existence. Therefore, the first aspect of the fundamental problem of philosophy cannot contain the second aspect. On the contrary, the second aspect, in the process of arguing whether thought and existence can be unified, does contain the first aspect. Therefore, the misconception that the first aspect already contains the second aspect arises from a lack of understanding of what the task of philosophy is, leading to various problems.

However, since liberation, the opposition between "materialism" and "idealism" has been regarded as the highest principle above all academic thought, as if any problem or theory, if not reduced to this opposition, is not a Marxist standpoint. Consequently, the various important links in the occurrence, growth, and transformation of things are often overlooked, and only abstract conclusions are satisfied. Marx devoted his life to the study of the laws of capitalist society, not just to the establishment of a materialist worldview; Lenin repeatedly emphasized that "the living soul of Marxism, its fundamental theoretical basis, is dialectics." He said, "Dialectics is the theory of knowledge." This is to say that Marx's materialism is to delve into things, not to be satisfied with individual actual experiences, but to rise to rational cognition, grasp the essence of things that conform to reality, and only then can subjective cognition be consistent with objective reality. Therefore, Lenin often said: dialectics, logic, and the theory of knowledge are one and the same thing. Unfortunately, these important opinions of the founders of Marxism on the second aspect of the fundamental problem of philosophy have not been given due attention by us.

　　胡曲园谈
    哲学基本问题再思考
    胡曲园在《文汇报》（一九八八年十二月二十日）上撰文指出，所谓哲学基本问题，一方面是要解决思维和存在谁是本原的问题；另一方面是需要解决思维和存在相互关系，即能否一致的问题。因为一个哲学家纵然强调自然是世界的本原，但是他的思维和行动如果同客观现实不相符合，这还有什么意义呢？一种哲学思想是否正确，并不完全决定于它属于唯心主义的阵营或是唯物主义的阵营，倒是决定于它能否真正解决思维和存在的相互关系，把握到客观的现实，作出符合客观实际的判断和决定。这也就是说，哲学的真正任务是在哲学基本问题的第二方面，而不在第一方面。第一方面不过是第二方面的理论前提，它说明了思维与存在在哲学领域中各自作为理论根据的不同过程，它没有要求和解决思维与存在之间存在的矛盾，所以哲学基本问题的第一方面不可能包含着第二方面，反之，第二方面在论证思维与存在能否同一的过程中倒是包含了第一方面。因此，认为第一方面已经包含了第二方面乃是不明白哲学任务是什么的一种误解，从而引出了不少问题。
    但是，解放以来都把“唯物”、“唯心”的对立，看作了超乎一切学术思想的最高准则，似乎任何一个问题、任何一个理论，若不归结到这个对立的观点上来，就不是马克思主义的立场。因而往往忽视了事物的所以发生，所以成长和转化的种种重要环节，只是满足于抽象的结论。马克思倾其毕生精力于资本主义社会规律的研究，而不仅仅满足于唯物世界观的树立；列宁一再强调“马克思主义的活的灵魂，它的根本的理论基础，是辩证法。”并说“辩证法就是认识论”。无非说明马克思的唯物主义是要深入事物，不要满足于个别的实际经验，而要上升到理性认识，把握到符合于实际的事物本质，才算是达到了主观认识同客观现实的一致，所以列宁常说：辩证法、逻辑、认识论是一个东西。也就是这个意思。可惜这些马克思主义的创始人对于哲学基本问题第二方面的重要意见，并未受到我们的重视。
