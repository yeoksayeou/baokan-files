	Such Parallelism is Inappropriate

	Editor,

	In recent years, people have gotten used to calling crimes such as embezzlement, bribery, and fraud "economic crimes," while calling crimes such as murder, rape, and robbery "criminal offenses." Some publications also list economic crimes and criminal offenses side by side, which I believe is inappropriate.

	Criminal offenses refer to acts that violate criminal law and are subject to criminal penalties. In our country, these include counter-revolutionary crimes, crimes endangering public security, crimes disrupting the socialist economic order, crimes infringing upon citizens' personal and democratic rights, crimes against property, crimes obstructing social administration, crimes against marriage and family, and dereliction of duty. Crimes disrupting the socialist economic order and crimes against property include embezzlement, bribery, fraud, smuggling, and so on. Therefore, whether it is murder, rape, or embezzlement, fraud, and the like, all are criminal offenses.

	Of course, if one insists on calling embezzlement, bribery, smuggling, fraud, and other crimes "economic crimes," one must make it clear that they are in a subordinate relationship, not a parallel one. Otherwise, it is not only easy to give people the wrong impression that economic crimes do not belong to criminal offenses, but in judicial practice, it may also lead to lighter sentences for embezzlement and bribery, resulting in fines replacing criminal penalties and internal handling of cases.

	Postscript:

	In daily life, some people, relying on their relatives' and friends' influence or their own wealth and power, place themselves in a "special" position, acting tyrannically and terrorizing the local area, infringing upon others' rights, and no one dares to intervene. Over time, these people become figures whom "no one dares to touch," causing the public to fear and leaders to be troubled, as if the law cannot touch them. In the face of such people, relevant units often appear weak and powerless, and some law enforcement officers also have the idea of fearing power, forgetting that "punishing criminals and protecting the people" is their duty. This is unacceptable and must be corrected as soon as possible.

　　如此并列不妥
    编辑同志：
    近几年来，人们习惯于把贪污、受贿、诈骗等犯罪称为经济犯罪，而把杀人、强奸、抢劫等犯罪称为刑事犯罪。有的报刊也把经济犯罪与刑事犯罪并列提出，我认为是不当的。
    犯罪是指违反刑法应受刑事处罚的行为。在我国，它包括反革命罪，危害公共安全罪，破坏社会主义经济秩序罪，侵害公民人身权利、民主权利罪，侵犯财产罪，妨害社会管理秩序罪，妨害婚姻、家庭罪和渎职罪。破坏社会主义经济秩序罪和侵犯财产罪，就包含贪污、受贿、诈骗、走私等等犯罪。所以，不论是杀人、强奸，还是贪污、诈骗等等，都是刑事犯罪。
    当然，如果一定要把贪污、受贿、走私、诈骗等犯罪称为经济犯罪，一定要让人们能够看出，它们之间是从属关系，而不是并列关系。否则，不仅容易使人们产生经济犯罪不属于刑事犯罪的错觉，而且，在司法实际工作中，还容易造成对贪污受贿等罪犯量刑偏轻，出现以罚代刑、内部处理了事等等。

    编后：在日常生活中，有的人借助亲朋权势，或凭依财大气粗等等，把自己放在“特殊”位置上，霸道一方、横行乡里，侵犯他人权利，无人敢于过问。久而久之，这些人便成了“老虎屁股摸不得”的人物，群众怕，领导头疼，似乎法律管不着他们。在这类人面前，有关单位往往显得软弱无力，某些执法人员也存在惧怕权势的思想，忘记了“惩治罪犯，保护人民”是自己的职责，这是不能容许的，应当尽快加以纠正。
