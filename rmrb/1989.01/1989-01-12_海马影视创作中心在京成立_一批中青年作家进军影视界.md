Haima Film and Television Creation Center Established in Beijing
A Batch of Mid-Career and Young Writers Enter the Film and Television Industry

BEIJING, Jan. 11 (Xinhua) — A center aimed at improving the quality of Chinese film and television scripts, the Haima Film and Television Creation Center, was established in Beijing today. The center is composed of a group of mid-career and young writers and scriptwriters currently active in the literary field, with Wang Shuo serving as the first chairman.

Ma Weidu, the center's secretary-general and a writer, told reporters from home and abroad that the center will accept guidance from the Film Bureau of the Broadcasting and Film Administration in terms of creation, while maintaining and developing their own artistic characteristics, striving to create a truly diverse and flourishing creative atmosphere.

Wang Shuo introduced several features of the center. The members of the center have been a driving force in the field of film and television literature in recent years. This young force has almost encompassed the creation of excellent films in 1988. It is reported that, in addition to Wang Shuo's own four films, "The Hooligan," "Reincarnation," "Breathless," and "Half Fire, Half Sea," center member Liu Yiran is the screenwriter for "Rock 'n' Roll Youth," and Li Jian is the screenwriter for "Crazy Songstress." The author of "Red Sorghum," Mo Yan, and the author of "Undercover Policeman," Hai Yan, have also "joined" the center.

Such a powerful civilian creative team is the first of its kind in New China.

The center's work will focus on improving the quality of entertainment films, while also strengthening the creation of other types of films, and writing scripts for outstanding directors and actors upon request.

Wang Shuo believes that in the past, the connection between scriptwriters and directors, actors, and other film professionals in China's film and television industry has been too weak, which is not conducive to the production of film and television works.

The center today distributed "The Haima Declaration" to reporters. The declaration states: An artist's creative life is the most important. We respect and call for friction and conflict in artistic pursuits. The declaration explains why the center is named "Haima": The seahorse can be used medicinally throughout its body, with effects such as invigorating, strengthening the body, inducing childbirth, relieving pain, and strengthening the heart. Now, literature and art are shy and hesitant, struggling between the refined and the vulgar. But we just want to say: Have a few seahorses, whoever lacks what, let it get what it needs.

Some well-known writers who have joined the center are expected to have a significant impact on the Chinese film industry in 1989. Films that have been listed in the production plans of various studios or are already in production include Liu Heng's "Fu Xi" (directed by Zhang Yimou), "Black Snow" (directed by Xie Fei), Wang Shuo's "Playing with Your Heart" (directed by Zhang Nuannuan), and Mo Yan and Liu Yiran's "The Flood" (directed by Tian Zhuangzhuang). The most productive may be the writer Fu Xiuwen, with six films, including "Wild Seed" and "The Great Conspiracy," scheduled to be produced this year.

### 海马影视创作中心在京成立  一批中青年作家进军影视界

　　海马影视创作中心在京成立
    一批中青年作家进军影视界
    本报北京１月１１日讯  记者李力报道：以提高我国影视剧作水平为目的的海马影视创作中心今天在此间宣告成立。中心由一批目前活跃在文坛的中青年作家和剧作家组成，王朔出任第一任理事长。
    中心秘书长、作家马未都向中外记者介绍说，这个中心接受广播影视部电影局在创作上的指导，同时保持和发展各自的艺术特色，争取形成真正的百花齐放的创作局面。
    王朔介绍了这个中心的几个特点。中心的成员在近几年的影视文学方面是一支生力军。这支年轻的力量几乎囊括了１９８８年优秀影片的创作。据悉，除了王朔本人的４部影片即《顽主》、《轮回》、《大喘气》和《一半是火焰一半是海水》外，中心成员刘毅然是《摇滚青年》的编剧，李建是《疯狂歌女》的编剧。《红高粱》的作者莫言和《便衣警察》作者海岩也“加盟”中心。
    这样具有较强实力的民间创作团体，在新中国尚属首次出现。
    这个中心的工作重点在于提高娱乐片的创作水平，同时加强其它片种的创作，并应约为优秀导演和优秀演员写剧本。
    王朔认为，以往我国影视界里剧作家与导演、演员和其他电影专业人员之间的联系太少，这对于影视作品的生产是不利的。
    这个中心今天向各位记者散发了《海马宣言》。宣言称：一个作家的艺术生命是最重要的。我们尊重并呼唤艺术追求上的摩擦和冲突。宣言对中心为何命名为“海马”作了解释：海马全身均可入药，有壮阳、健身、催产、止痛、强心等功效。如今，文学艺术正羞羞答答地左右为难，雅和俗像扯着一把锯的两只手。而我们只想说：来几两海马吧，谁缺少什么，就让它得到什么。
    加盟该中心的一些知名作家，预计将对１９８９年的中国影坛产生不小的影响。已由各制片厂列入投拍计划或已经投拍的有刘恒的《伏羲伏羲》（张艺谋导演），《黑的雪》（谢飞导演），王朔的《玩的就是心跳》（张暖忻导演），莫言和刘毅然的《大水》（田壮壮导演）等。最高产的可能是作家傅绪文，今年将投拍由他写作的《野种》、《大阴谋》等６部影片。
