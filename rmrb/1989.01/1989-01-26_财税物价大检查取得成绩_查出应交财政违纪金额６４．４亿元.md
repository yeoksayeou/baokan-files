The comprehensive inspection of finance, taxation, and prices in 1988 achieved significant results. By the end of last December, a total of 6.44 billion yuan in unpaid fiscal violations were uncovered nationwide, of which 4.22 billion yuan have already been remitted to the treasury. According to a responsible person from the State Council's Comprehensive Inspection Office, 7.24 million enterprises, institutions, administrative units, and individual business households conducted self-inspections, covering 90% of the units; the State Council and local governments at various levels dispatched 580,000 inspectors to conduct focused inspections on 2.47 million units and individual households, covering 35.3% of the units.

This responsible person believes that the breadth, depth, and effectiveness of this comprehensive inspection are better than in previous years. However, there are still some problems, mainly: self-inspection development is uneven, with some enterprises submitting blank reports and going through the motions; some regions and departments have not met the requirements for focused inspections; the handling of uncovered violations is not resolute, showing leniency; the remittance rate of violation income is 65%, lower than in previous years.

This responsible person emphasized that before and after the Spring Festival, all regions and departments must complete all tasks of the comprehensive inspection from beginning to end.

　　财税物价大检查取得成绩   
    查出应交财政违纪金额６４．４亿元
    本报北京１月２５日讯  记者王锦鹄报道：１９８８年税收财务物价大检查取得了较大成绩，到去年１２月底，全国共查出应交财政违纪金额６４．４亿元，已上交入库４２．２亿元。据国务院大检查办公室负责人介绍，全国有７２４万个企业、事业、行政单位和个体工商户进行了自查，自查面达９０％；国务院和地方各级政府共派出５８万名检查人员，对２４７万个单位和个体户进行了重点检查，检查面达３５．３％。
    这位负责人认为，这次大检查的广度、深度和成效都好于往年。但也还存在一些问题，主要是：自查发展不平衡，有一部分企业交了白卷、走了过场；有些地区和部门重点检查面没有达到要求；对查出的违纪问题处理不坚决，有失之过宽现象；违纪收入入库率６５％，低于往年水平。
    这位负责人强调，春节前后各地区各部门必须善始善终完成大检查的各项任务。
