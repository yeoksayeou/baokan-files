The alkaline pulping process, which has historically polluted the environment, has successfully transformed its research results into practical applications thanks to support from the State Science Fund. This has enabled the reasonable utilization of paper mill wastewater.

Researchers at South China University of Technology, with the support of the National Natural Science Foundation, studied the structure and application of lignin. They theoretically mastered the structural characteristics of lignin in industrial materials and annual fiber plants in China, as well as the mechanisms by which chemical methods alter these characteristics. Using this mechanism, they received further funding from the Science Fund to transform the wastewater from paper mills into four products: drilling mud diluent, dye filler, cement grinding aid, and concrete retarder. The concrete retarder was used in the construction of the Jiugang Bridge in Guangdong, solving the problem of pillar construction and saving over 300 tons of cement per pillar.

Since 1987, the National Natural Science Foundation has selected some research results that have the conditions to be transferred to production for paid support, closely integrating basic research, applied research, and technological development. In the past two years, they have supported 25 projects (including 6 projects funded by the Science Fund). According to statistics from 8 projects in Guangdong, 7 projects have achieved benefits, creating a production value of over 20 million yuan for the state, a profit of 5.8 million yuan, and after repayment, the fund increased by 1 million yuan.

There were differing opinions on whether the Foundation should engage in result transformation work. Some scientists were concerned that this approach might hinder the support of basic research.

Relevant personnel from the Foundation stated that one characteristic of modern technological development is the closer integration of science and technology, as well as basic and applied research in many fields. The various stages of scientific research are interrelated and interdependent. Supporting result transformation is an important measure to perfect the Chinese-style science fund system.

The Foundation stipulates that supporting result transformation only uses a small amount of temporarily idle science funds and a small amount of special funds allocated by the State Science and Technology Commission, in the form of paid support. After the recipient unit obtains economic benefits, in addition to repaying the support fee, it must also provide an increased fee for the Science Fund, thus providing a new source of income for the Science Fund.

### 国家科学基金资助成果转化　有偿拨款获益可使基金增值

　　国家科学基金资助成果转化
  　有偿拨款获益可使基金增值
    本报讯  记者陈祖甲报道：历来污染环境的碱法造纸制浆废液，由于得到国家科学基金资助，顺利转化了理论研究的成果，如今可以合理利用了。
    华南理工大学的研究人员在国家自然科学基金的资助下，研究木质素结构特性与应用，从理论上掌握了我国工业用材及一年生植物纤维为原料的木质素结构特性和用化学方法改变其特性的机理。他们运用这种机理，得到科学基金的再资助，将造纸废液制成石油钻井泥浆稀释剂、染料填充剂、水泥助磨剂和混凝土缓凝剂等４种产品。混凝土缓凝剂在广东九江大桥建设中，解决了桥墩施工难题，每个桥墩节约水泥３００吨以上。
    从１９８７年起，国家自然科学基金委选择了一些有条件向生产转移的科研成果给予有偿资助，使基础研究、应用研究和技术开发三者紧密结合起来。近２年中，他们资助了２５个项目（其中６项是科学基金资助的课题）。仅据在广东的８个项目统计，有７个项目取得效益，为国家创造产值２０００余万元，利润５８０万元，偿还后反使基金额增加了１００万元。
    对于基金委要不要做成果转化工作，开始有不同看法，有些科学家顾虑这种做法对资助基础研究有妨碍。
    基金委有关人士说，现代科技发展的特点之一是科学与技术、基础与应用在许多领域结合得更加紧密。科学研究的各阶段相互关联、互为因果。资助成果转化是完善具有中国特色的科学基金制的一个重要措施。
    基金委规定，资助成果转化只是利用小量科学基金的暂歇基金和国家科委拨款的少量专款，以有偿资助方式进行。受资助单位在获得经济效益以后，除归还资助费之外，还要为科学基金提供增值费，为科学基金增加了一个新的来源。
