    Extensive Campaign of "Five Promotions, Five Oppositions" to Eliminate Old Customs and Promote New Norms Along the Southern Coast of Fujian

    Xinhua News Agency, Fuzhou, January 25th - (Reporter Cai Qinghe) The coastal areas of southern Fujian have extensively launched a campaign centered around "Five Promotions, Five Oppositions" to eliminate old customs and promote new norms, achieving notable results.

    The "Five Promotions, Five Oppositions" refer to promoting the advocacy of science, opposing feudal superstition; promoting healthy entertainment, opposing gambling; promoting free choice in marriage, opposing the buying and selling of marriages; promoting harmony among neighbors, opposing clan disputes; promoting hard work and entrepreneurship, opposing extravagance and waste.

    In recent times, certain backward and outdated customs have resurfaced in Fujian Province, particularly in the rural areas of the southern coastal region where the commodity economy is relatively developed. These customs include gambling, feudal superstition, the buying and selling of marriages, and extravagant weddings and funerals, which have severely affected production and social stability. For example, during the seventh and eighth lunar months, the southern coastal areas of Fujian still observe an old feudal custom known as "Universal Salvation." During this period, every household sets up large banquets and indulges in feasting, leading to frequent incidents of drunkenness, gambling, and fights, which not only result in waste but also cause market price fluctuations and disrupt social order. It is estimated that each household spending on "Universal Salvation" ranges from a few hundred to over a thousand yuan. Just in Jinjiang County and Shishi City, the annual expenditure on "Universal Salvation" exceeds 150 million yuan. Since 1987, the Quanzhou Municipal Party Committee has taken decisive action. Their approach involves assigning responsibilities to leaders at all levels, ensuring accountability, and combining the promotion of various healthy and beneficial cultural and sports activities with the prohibition of "Universal Salvation" and other feudal superstitions, effectively curbing these activities.

    Improving funeral reforms is a crucial part of the campaign to eliminate old customs and promote new norms. In the past, Quanzhou City was notorious for its extravagant funerals in both urban and rural areas. Whenever a funeral was held, not only was the expenditure enormous, but it also involved a large number of people, forming disco dance teams, horse-riding teams, Western music bands, and drum teams, among others. This practice of extravagant funerals was not only common but also increasingly prevalent. To address this issue, Quanzhou City established a funeral reform leadership group, issued the "Temporary Regulations on Funeral Management in Quanzhou" and its "Implementation Rules," and decided to start with the urban area as a breakthrough, mobilizing various departments such as civil affairs, public security, industry and commerce, culture, and women's and youth organizations to jointly manage the situation. The results were significant, with the cremation rate in the urban area now reaching 98%; funeral activities are now civilized and simple, basically eliminating feudal superstitions.

    During the campaign to eliminate old customs and promote new norms, many places have also leveraged the power of mass organizations, mobilizing the masses to engage in self-education, self-management, and self-service. Zhangzhou City, for example, has established over 3,400 "Custom Reform Councils," "Youth New Wind Promotion Associations," and "Senior Citizens' Associations" at the village level.

　　广泛开展“五提倡、五反对”活动    
    闽南沿海弃旧俗树新风
    新华社福州１月２５日电（记者蔡清河）闽南沿海各地广泛开展以“五提倡、五反对”为中心内容的移风易俗活动，取得了明显成效。
    所谓“五提倡、五反对”，即提倡崇尚科学，反对封建迷信；提倡健康娱乐，反对聚众赌博；提倡婚姻自主，反对买卖婚姻；提倡村邻和睦，反对宗族纠纷；提倡艰苦创业，反对铺张浪费。
    一个时期以来，福建省社会上，特别是商品经济比较发达的闽南沿海一带农村，某些愚昧落后的旧俗陋习，如赌博、封建迷信、买卖婚姻、婚丧事大操大办等又有所抬头，严重影响生产和社会秩序安定。如每逢农历七八月间，在闽南沿海一带城乡，有一种旧社会遗留下来的封建习俗——“普渡”。“普渡”期间，各家各户都要大摆宴席，大吃大喝，因此，酗酒闹事、聚众赌博、打架斗殴等现象时有发生，不仅浪费，同时造成市场物价上涨，影响社会治安。据估算，每户做“普渡”的开支，多者上千元，少者也要二三百元。仅晋江县、石狮市每年搞“普渡”就要耗资１５００万元以上。从１９８７年起，泉州市委下决心抓了一下。他们的做法是，各级党委领导实行责任包干，层层落实，并把开展各种健康有益的文体活动与制止“普渡”等各种封建迷信活动结合起来，从而有效地制止了“普渡”活动。
    搞好殡葬改革是开展移风易俗活动的一项重要内容。过去，泉州市城乡死人厚葬远近闻名。每逢办丧事不仅花费很大，而且动用大批人马，组成迪斯科舞队、骑马队、西乐队、大鼓队等等。这种吹吹打打大办丧事的现象，在当地不仅见怪不怪，而且愈演愈烈。为了解决这个问题，泉州市成立了殡改领导小组，颁布了《泉州殡葬管理暂行规定》和《实施细则》，并决定以市区为突破口，发动民政、公安、工商、文化、工青妇等各方面齐抓共管。这样抓的结果，效果明显，市区的火化率现已达到９８％；丧事活动文明简朴，基本做到不搞封建迷信活动。
    在开展移风易俗活动中，许多地方还发挥群众组织的作用，发动群众开展自我教育、自我管理、自我服务。漳州市以村为单位建立起“移风易俗理事会”、“青年新风促进会”、“老人协会”等３４００多个。
