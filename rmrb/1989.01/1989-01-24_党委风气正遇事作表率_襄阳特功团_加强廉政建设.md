The "Xiangyang Special Merit Unit" Strengthens Anti-Corruption Measures

A recent piece of good news from the "Xiangyang Special Merit Unit" of the Nanjing Military Region: The unit has been named an "Advanced Unit" for the fifth time, and its Party Committee has been named an "Advanced Party Committee." What is the secret to their success? Soldiers unanimously attribute it to the Party Committee's upright conduct and their willingness to set an example for the masses.

In recent years, the unit has abandoned past practices of lax discipline enforcement, superficial Party discipline education, and leadership oversight of the masses and headquarters oversight of the grassroots. Instead, it has focused on strict self-discipline within the leadership and headquarters. The Party Committee has formulated several regulations, including "Several Standards for Leadership and Headquarters to Uphold Integrity" and "Regulations for Public Supervision and Commendation of Leaders." The Party Committee does not avoid or delay addressing issues raised by the masses; instead, it investigates and handles them promptly. Once, the unit's political commissar, Ren Shangti, received a supervisory call from a soldier reporting that a Party Committee member had used party membership and color TV tickets as bargaining chips in recruiting party members. Ren immediately took an organizational cadre to investigate and gather evidence. After verification, the committee member was severely punished and ordered to return the party membership ticket and color TV ticket. The unit also appointed 20 "discipline supervisors" from the local population. The unit originally had two Jeeps, one of which has been in use since the 1960s and is no longer operational. At the end of the previous year, higher authorities allocated funds for the purchase of a new car, and the unit was to contribute part of the production income. The Party Committee presented this matter to the entire unit's military assembly, allowing everyone to express their opinions. Ultimately, following the soldiers' suggestions, the funds earmarked for the car purchase were used to improve the cultural and training facilities of the companies.

　　党委风气正遇事作表率
    “襄阳特功团”加强廉政建设
    本报讯  南京军区“襄阳特功团”近日传出喜讯：该团已第５次被评为“先进团”，团党委被评为“先进党委”。奥秘何在？官兵一致反映：只缘党委风气正，敢为群众作表率。
    近年来，这个团一改过去那种执行纪律上宽下严、党纪教育上面讲下面听、领导管群众、机关管基层的做法，注重从领导和机关自身严起。团党委制订了《领导机关廉洁奉公若干标准》、《群众监督领导褒扬规定》等制度。党委对群众反映的问题，不回避、不拖延、及时查处。一次，团政委任尚提接到一位战士的监督电话，反映一名党委委员发展党员时用党票和彩电票作交易，他立即带着组织干事进行调查取证，核实后对这位委员进行了严肃处理，责成其收回党票退回彩电票。这个团还在驻地群众中聘请了２０名“纪律监督员”。团里原有两辆吉普车，从６０年代一直用到现在，其中一台已不能使用，前年年底，上级拨给一笔资金，让他们再从生产收入中凑一部分购一辆轿车，党委将这一事情摆到全团军人大会上，让大家发表意见。最后终于按照大家的建议把这笔购车款用到了改善连队文化生活和训练设施上。
