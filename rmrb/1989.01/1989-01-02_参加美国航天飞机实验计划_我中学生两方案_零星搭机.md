The results of the second China Youth Space Shuttle Science Experiment Plan Review were recently announced in Beijing. Two middle school students' experiment plans were selected to participate in the 1990 U.S. Space Shuttle "Get-Away Special" experiment program.

The two selected plans are "Growth and Reproduction of Paramecium" designed by Yu Wei, a female student from Huabei Pharmaceutical Factory School in Shijiazhuang, and "Study of Solid-Liquid Interface Interaction in Space" designed by Cui Yusuo, a student from No. 26 Middle School in Jinshui County, Zhengzhou. It is reported that more than ten thousand experiment plans from youths across various provinces, municipalities, autonomous regions, and the Hong Kong region participated in this review. Among them, 28 were selected as national excellent experiment plans. Dr. Li Jiexin, a Chinese-American scientist, praised the Chinese plans, saying they were more advanced and in-depth compared to plans from other countries.

The "Get-Away Special" program is an initiative by the U.S. National Aeronautics and Space Administration to provide opportunities for young people to participate in space shuttle scientific experiments. It offers the remaining space in the shuttle at a low cost to students from various countries to conduct space experiments.

　　参加美国航天飞机实验计划
    我中学生两方案“零星搭机”
    据新华社北京电  （记者陈智强）第二届中国青少年航天飞机科学实验方案评审结果前不久在北京揭晓，两名中学生设计的实验方案被选中参加１９９０年美国航天飞机“零星搭机”实验计划。
    这两个方案是石家庄市华北制药厂子弟学校女学生俞纬设计的《草履虫的生长与繁殖》方案和郑州市金水县二十六中学生崔予松设计的《太空中研究固—液表面间相互作用》方案。据介绍，参加这次评审活动的有来自各省、市、自治区和香港地区青少年万余项实验方案，其中有２８项已被评为全国优秀实验方案。美籍华人科学家李杰信博士称赞中国选送的方案比其它国家的方案更有水平、更有深度。
    “零星搭机”计划是指美国航空航天局为青少年参加航天飞机科学实验提供条件，即将机上空余舱位廉价提供给各国青少年学生进行太空实验的计划。
