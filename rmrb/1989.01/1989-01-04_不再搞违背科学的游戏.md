Your newspaper published an article titled "Modern Sorcery That Desecrates Science" with accompanying photographs on the fifth page of the November 16, 1988 issue. The Party Committee of our institute and the leaders of our department have paid great attention to this matter. They promptly educated the relevant students and organized a discussion throughout the Mathematics Department. The students realized that although this was a game organized to liven up the atmosphere of the Yunnan Arts Festival using computers on campus, such a game is against science and has a certain element of superstition.

　　不再搞违背科学的游戏
    你报１９８８年１１月１６日第五版刊登《亵渎科学的现代巫卜》一文和照片，院党委和系领导极为重视，及时对有关学生进行了教育，并在全数学系开展了一次讨论。同学们认识到：尽管这是为活跃云南艺术节节日气氛，在校内用电子计算机搞的游戏，但这种游戏是违背科学的，带有一定迷信色彩。
