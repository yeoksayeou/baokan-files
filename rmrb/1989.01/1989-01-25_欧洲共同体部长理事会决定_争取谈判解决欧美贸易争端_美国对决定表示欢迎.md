The European Community Council of Ministers decided today to postpone retaliatory measures against the United States and seek a negotiated resolution to the meat trade dispute. The United States welcomed the decision.

New China News Agency, Brussels, January 23 (Reporter Zhuge Canglin) The European Community Council of Ministers today decided to postpone retaliatory measures against the United States and seek a negotiated resolution to the meat trade dispute.

The foreign ministers of the 12 EC countries, meeting in Brussels today, unanimously agreed to the EC Commission's proposal to impose a 100% tariff on two categories of food products, walnuts and dried fruits, exported from the United States to Western Europe (valued at nearly $100 million) to offset the losses caused by the retaliatory tariffs imposed by the United States on Western Europe since January 1 of this year. However, the 12 countries decided to postpone the implementation date of the retaliatory plan, pending further discussion at the foreign ministers' meeting on February 20, depending on the progress of negotiations with the United States. At the same time, the EC called on the new U.S. government to stop implementing the 100% import tax on seven categories of food products from Western Europe.

The new chairman of the Council of Ministers, Spanish Foreign Minister Fernandez Ordonez, told the press after the meeting that the 12 foreign ministers hoped that the negotiations between the EC and the United States would "make meaningful progress."

While seeking a compromise with the United States, the EC also filed a complaint with the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT), asking the GATT Council to rule on whether the United States' unilateral retaliatory actions violated free trade principles.

The EC had previously stated that if the United States retaliated against its ban on the import of hormone-treated meat from third countries, it would respond in kind. However, later disagreements emerged within the EC. Some countries were reluctant to engage in a major conflict with the United States over a $100 million trade dispute (the annual trade volume between Europe and the United States is over $150 billion) and advocated for a resolution, while others hoped that retaliatory measures would be implemented as soon as possible.

The U.S. mission to the EC issued a brief statement tonight welcoming the EC's decision, calling it a "positive step" toward resolving the conflict, but did not respond to the call to suspend retaliatory measures.

　　欧洲共同体部长理事会决定    
    争取谈判解决欧美贸易争端
    美国对决定表示欢迎
    新华社布鲁塞尔１月２３日电（记者诸葛仓麟）欧洲共同体部长理事会今天决定推迟对美国实施反报复措施，争取和美国通过谈判解决肉类贸易争端。
    共同体１２国外交部长今天在布鲁塞尔举行的会议上，一致同意共同体委员会提出的反报复方案，即对美国向西欧出口的核桃和干果两类食品征收１００％的关税（价值接近１亿美元），以抵销美国自今年１月１日对西欧实行的报复性关税造成的损失。但是，１２国决定推迟反报复方案的实施日期，视与美国谈判进展情况于２月２０日举行的外长会上再议。同时，共同体呼吁美新政府停止执行对西欧七类食品加征的１００％进口税。
    部长理事会新任执行主席、西班牙外交大臣费尔南德斯·奥多涅斯在会后对报界说，１２国外长希望共同体与美国进行的谈判“取得有意义的进展”。
    共同体在争取和美国求得妥协的同时，还向关贸总协定提出申诉，要求关贸总协定理事会就美国单方面报复行为是否违反自由贸易准则作出裁决。
    共同体曾经宣称，如果美国对它停止从第三国进口含荷尔蒙肉类的禁令实行报复，它将针锋相对地予以反击。但是，后来共同体内部出现分歧。一些国家不愿仅为涉及１亿美元的贸易争端（欧美年贸易额达１５００亿美元以上）与美国“大动干戈”，力主和解，而另一些国家则希望反报复措施尽快生效。
    美国驻共同体使团今晚在一项简短声明中对共同体作出的决定表示欢迎，称之为走向解决冲突的“积极步骤”，但没有对关于中止报复措施的呼吁作出反应。
