To commend young developers in impoverished regions, the Communist Youth League Central Committee and the Office of the State Council's Leading Group for Poverty Alleviation and Development selected ten "Young Development Experts" from the Taihang Mountains, Dabie Mountains, Dingxi, and 15 other impoverished areas.

In March 1987, the Communist Youth League Central Committee, in accordance with the State Council's directives on economic development in impoverished regions, decided to organize young people in these areas to engage in small-scale development activities aimed at poverty alleviation and prosperity. Over the past two years, according to incomplete statistics, 15 million rural youth in impoverished counties at the national and provincial levels have participated in this activity. They have established 8 million small-scale production projects, including small farms, small ranches, and small workshops, each with its own unique characteristics and leading the way in their respective fields. Among them, the top 10 performers have been awarded the title of "Expert," and will attend the national "Ten Outstanding Young Development Experts" symposium and report meeting in Beijing this March.

    本报讯  为了表彰贫困地区青年开发者，团中央和国务院贫困地区开发领导小组办公室在太行山、大别山、定西等１８个贫困区评选出十名“青年开发能人”。
    １９８７年３月，团中央根据国务院关于贫困地区经济开发工作的指示精神，作出了组织贫困地区青年开展脱贫致富小开发活动的决定。两年来，据不完全统计，国家及省级贫困县有１５００万农村青年参加了这项活动，兴办小庄园、小牧场、小作坊等开发生产项目８００万个，涌现出一大批种植、养殖、加工业能手，各具特色，各领风骚。他们当中的１０名优胜者摘取“能人”的桂冠，将于今年３月赴京，参加全国“十大青年开发能人座谈汇报会”。
