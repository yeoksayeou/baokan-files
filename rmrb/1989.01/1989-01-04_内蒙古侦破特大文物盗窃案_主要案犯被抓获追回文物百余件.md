The major cultural relics theft case that occurred in Inner Mongolia last year has been solved by the public security authorities. The criminal gang has been dismantled, and over 100 precious cultural relics have been recovered on their way to being smuggled abroad.

According to relevant departments, in April, June, and September of last year, Huang Adiya, who was working temporarily at the Wuchang Temple in Baotou City, colluded with Yu Xiaochun, Chen Gang, and others to steal 142 cultural relics from the temple, including 4 national first-class relics, 1 second-class relic, and 126 third-class relics. These relics were made in the early Qing Dynasty, with exquisite craftsmanship and precious materials. Among them, the first-class relics "Gilded Mandala (Bronze City)," "Gilded Bodhisattva Attendant," and "Gilded Offering Tower" are rare national ethnic and religious relics.

The police officers from the Donghe District Criminal Investigation Squad of Baotou City, who were responsible for solving the case, worked tirelessly for 11 consecutive days and nights, arresting the main culprits and seizing most of the stolen items.

Located 70 kilometers northeast of Baotou City, Wuchang Temple was built in the 18th century. It is known as one of the three major temples of Tibetan Buddhism in China, along with the Potala Palace in Tibet and the Kumbum Monastery in Qinghai.
