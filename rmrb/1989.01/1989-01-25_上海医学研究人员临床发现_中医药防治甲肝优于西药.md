Shanghai medical researchers have clinically discovered that traditional Chinese medicine is effective in preventing and treating Hepatitis A, particularly in reducing jaundice, improving symptoms, and shortening the course of the disease, and is superior to Western medicine.

During the Hepatitis A outbreak in Shanghai last year, Longhua Hospital conducted a comparative study on 2,562 patients by setting up control groups for traditional Chinese medicine and Western medicine. The results showed that 66.9% of patients in the traditional Chinese medicine group had their jaundice disappear within 20 days, compared to 17.24% in the Western medicine group. In terms of the recovery time for "alanine aminotransferase" to return to normal, 24.91% of patients in the traditional Chinese medicine group achieved this within 20 days, compared to 15.67% in the Western medicine group. Xuhui District Central Hospital statistically analyzed 256 cases of Hepatitis A, with a clinical cure rate of 91.6% in the traditional Chinese medicine group and 65.5% in the Western medicine group. Shanghai Infectious Disease Hospital treated 368 severe jaundice patients, with a cure rate of 98.8% and a mortality rate of 1.2% in the traditional Chinese medicine group; the Western medicine group had a cure rate of 94.4% and a mortality rate of 5.6%.

　　上海医学研究人员临床发现    
    中医药防治甲肝优于西药
    新华社上海１月２４日电（记者马雪松）上海医学研究人员在临床中发现，中医药防治甲型肝炎效果好，尤其在消退黄疸、改善症状、缩短病程方面优于西药。
    去年上海“甲肝”流行期间，上海龙华医院对收治的２５６２例患者，设中西医对照组进行比较研究，中医药组２０天内黄疸消退患者占６６．９％，西医组为１７．２４％；就“谷丙转氨酶”恢复正常时间看，２０天之内，中医药组占患者２４．９１％，西医药组占１５．６７％。上海市徐汇区中心医院统计了２５６例“甲肝”病例，中医药组临床治愈率为９１．６％，西医药组临床治愈率为６５．５％。上海市传染病医院收治重度黄疸型患者３６８例，其中用中医药治疗，治愈率达９８．８％，死亡率为１．２％；西医药组治愈率为９４．４％，死亡率达５．６％。
