　　Several Issues in the Half-Year Mutual Aid in the Fourth District of Xingtai
    (1) Mobilization of production mutual aid after the land reform movement.
    After educating people on the mutual aid policy, we emphasized prosperity through labor instead of struggle, first clearing the minds of village cadres and emancipated peasants, and resolving the masses' fear of equal distribution of property. Then, we cleaned up the "muddle-headed groups," pointed out that Chairman Mao's mutual aid policy was absolutely voluntary, and called for large-scale organization. After carrying water for planting and organizing wheat harvesting, the masses initially felt that mutual aid was beneficial. Through this period of farm work mutual aid, each base point had its typical groups and typical people. The district summarized the wheat harvest mutual aid, pointing out the importance of dry planting to preserve seedlings and the urgent need for sowing. In the Fourth District, there were 95,000 mu of dry land, with 50,000 mu planted using dry planting methods. Then, after the rains, we rushed to plant, rectified the mutual aid groups, and prepared for weeding. The entire Fourth District experienced two high tides during the wheat harvest and the rush to plant.
    (2) The scope of organized mutual aid.
    Statistics from seventeen villages show that there were 2,582 households, with 1,877 organized; there were 2,233 male laborers, with 1,543 organized; there were 920 livestock, with 793 organized. There were a total of 330 mutual aid groups, with 135 implementing work points for labor and equal distribution, and the remaining 165 using labor exchange and work recording. The seventeen villages had a population of 9,072, planting 3,330 mu of radishes and vegetables, averaging 3.3 li per person. One mutual aid group in Zhaoguzhuang, with nine households, mutually aided in reclaiming 20 mu of wasteland. One village, Zhangdong, dug seven wells and renovated four old wells, with each well irrigating 30 mu of land. Eight villages cultivated a typical person during the production movement. All of this shows that mutual aid has achieved great results.
    (3) Several experiences in organizing:
    A. In the new areas, to organize mutual aid, first, clear the minds of village cadres and have them take the lead in participating in mutual aid. Village cadres often experience ideological struggles when transitioning from the emancipation movement to the production movement. When mobilizing Chen Baoshan, the village head of Huole Village, to participate in mutual aid, he felt that participating in mutual aid conflicted with his work, and that he had methods for leading mass movements but not for leading production. After ideological struggle, he participated in mutual aid, resolving the contradiction between work and mutual aid; "the main thing was not wanting to labor." Experience has proven that it is necessary to seize emancipated peasants as the backbone for production, which is the main key to expanding mutual aid; in addition, middle peasants participating in mutual aid will naturally be drawn into the movement as long as democratic, voluntary, and equal value principles are followed. B. Organizing should emphasize equal value, increasing and decreasing wages in a timely manner according to the season and farm work. For example, Zhangdong Village failed to resolve equal value during the wheat harvest and rush planting, and the mutual aid groups collapsed in a short period. After rectifying and resolving the wage issue during weeding, twenty-seven mutual aid groups were reorganized. Currently, the wage for the first weeding is seven jin of rice, and the wage for the second weeding is reduced to five jin of rice. Now, more than 80% of the entire village is organized. C. Mutual aid group plans should be regular, turning peasants' leisure time into busy farming time, focusing on agriculture and developing sideline occupations and handicrafts. Li Xiaoyin, a military dependent woman in Xishawa Village, participated in mutual aid during the wheat harvest. After finishing her own wheat harvest, she calculated that she had some spare time and participated in spinning and weaving. She learned to weave cloth in half a month, weaving one zhang per day. During the slack season, the village organized four or five people to dig medicinal herbs, earning 100,000 yuan, and organized eleven people to transport goods, earning 90,000 yuan in six days. Mutual aid groups should not only calculate current work but also future work. Zhangdong Village planned to finish weeding in three days and then extract labor to dig wells. Currently, the village head and the peasant association chairman are leading forty people to organize well digging. D. Timely summarize achievements, continuously educate everyone with the benefits of mutual aid, launch mass inspections, clear the minds of the masses using accounting methods, and timely commend models to establish production flags. After the wheat harvest, Xishawa Village summarized the mutual aid and promoted four model figures. During the summary, sixteen mutual aid groups had four good mutual aid groups. After commendation, they have now developed into twelve good mutual aid groups. E. Combine labor and conscious education in mutual aid groups to continuously improve the class consciousness of village cadres and emancipated peasants. On this basis, expand mutual aid and unite forces. Recognize the landlords' sabotage of mutual aid in production and ideologically separate from the landlords. Landlords mainly use the following methods to sabotage production: First, seize the contradictions between military dependents and village cadres, and use the remaining struggle fruits to provoke relations between cadres and the masses; second, drill into mutual aid groups, use labor to buy off cadres, or try to break into cooperatives to achieve their sabotage purposes. Through the above education, the landlords' conspiracies were exposed, and mutual aid was consolidated.

　　邢台四区半年互助中几个问题
    （一）经过土地改革运动以后，生产互助的动员。
    从互助政策教育后，强调劳动发家不斗争，首先打通村干部和翻身农民思想，解决群众怕均产思想。接着就清理了“糊涂组”，指出毛主席互助政策绝对自愿，号召大量组织起来。经过担水点花与组织麦收，群众初步感到互助有利。经这段农活互助，各基点上都有了典型组与典型人。区里总结了麦收互助，指出干寄保苗，突击下种，这一段互助是很紧张的。四区旱地九万五千亩，干寄达五万亩，接着就是下雨突击种地，整顿互助准备锄苗。整个四区麦收和突击下种，是两个高潮。
    （二）组织起来的互助面。
    十七个村统计，有二五八二户，组织起来一八七七户，男劳动力是二二三三个，组织起来一五四三个；牲口九二○个，组织起来七九三个。共三三○个互助组，实行工票折工平分一三五个，其余换工记工一六五个。十七村九○七二口人，种萝卜菜三三三○亩，每人平均三分三厘。赵古庄一个互助组共九户，互助开荒地二○亩。张东一个村打井七个，改旧井四个，每一眼井可浇地三十亩。有八个村在生产运动中培养了一个典型人。这都说明互助成绩是很大的。
    （三）组织起来几个经验：
    甲、新区组织互助，首先，打通村干部思想，参加互助起带头作用。村干部从翻身运动转到生产运动，往往发生思想斗争。开始动员霍乐村村长陈保山参加互助时，他觉得对参加互助和工作矛盾，感到领导群众运动有办法，领导生产没有办法。经过思想斗争，参加了互助，解决了工作与互助间的矛盾问题，“主要是不想劳动”。经验证明必需抓住翻身农民为生产的骨干，这是互助扩大主要的关键；另外中农参加互助，只要作到民主自愿等价，自然会卷入生活运动中来的。乙、组织起来应该强调等价，按季节按农活及时提高与降低工资，比如张东村在麦收与抢种时，没有解决了等价，很短时期互助垮台。经过锄苗时整顿解决工资问题，又组织起二十七个互助组，到现在还互助锄头遍苗工资七斤米，锄二遍工资降低五斤米。现在全村组织起来百分之八十以上。丙、互助组计划要经常，把群众农闲变成农忙，要以农业为主计算，发展副业、手工业。西沙洼军属女人李小银，收麦时参加互助，把自己麦子收完后，计算当时农活消闲就参加纺织，半个月学会了织布，每天织一丈。该村在农闲时组织四、五人刨药材、赚洋十万元，组织十一人运输，六天赚洋九万元。互助组不但计算当前活，还要计算将来活。张东村在锄苗时，计划三天锄完，抽出劳力打井，现在村长农会主席正领导四十人组织打井。丁、及时总结成绩，不断拿互助好处来教育大家，发动群众性的检查，用算帐办法打通群众思想，及时表扬模范，树立生产旗帜。西沙洼村在麦收后，总结互助，出村长温良替四个模范人物。总结时，十六个互助组就有四个好互助组，经过表扬后，现在已经发展成十二个好互助组。戊、在互助组结合劳动自觉教育，不断提高村干部与翻身农民的阶级觉悟，在此基础上扩大互助，团结力量。在生产中认识地主破坏互助，从思想上和地主分家。生产中地主破坏，主要用以下几种手段：第一、抓军属和村干部矛盾，利用遗留斗争果实问题挑拨干群关系；第二、钻进互助组，用劳力收买干部，或设法打入合作社以遂其破坏目的。经过以上教育，揭破了地主的阴谋，巩固了互助。
