　　Jiexiu Zhang Ximan Militia Rotation Team
　　Repels a Regiment of Yan's Army Looting Grain
[Our Newspaper Taiyue, 25th] The Zhang Ximan Rotation Team, in coordination with the county's main force, used a force much smaller than the enemy to repel a regiment of Yan's army attempting to loot grain. On the morning of the 15th, the entire 29th Regiment of the 73rd Division of Yan's army in Jiexiu city and one battalion of the 217th Regiment, equipped with two mortars and three heavy machine guns, invaded Houshanzhuang and Zhao Jia Yao in our 7th District to loot grain. Upon hearing this, the county's main force and the Zhang Ximan Rotation Team immediately coordinated with the militias of Zhao Jia Yao and Shangliang villages to strike the enemy head-on. The first detachment of the Zhang Ximan Rotation Team and the militias of Zhao Jia Yao and Shangliang further employed hornet tactics, swarming from all directions and heavily surrounding the enemy. Although the enemy bombarded with dense mortar and heavy machine gun fire, they were unable to break through the encirclement. After four hours of fierce fighting, the enemy was unable to withstand and retreated. One company commander and one platoon leader of the enemy were killed, along with two soldiers, and six enemy soldiers were wounded. We suffered no casualties.
　　[Our Newspaper Taiyue, 26th] Over 120 members of the Yan stubborn Baojing [Security Police] team trapped in Anyi have been frantically looting grain due to food shortages. Our Yishi and Wanquan Independent Battalion ambushed them on the 21st in the villages of Nanbeizhang (15 li northwest of Yuncheng). At dawn, the enemy arrived at the village and fell into our ambush. After 30 minutes of fighting, 17 enemy personnel, including a lieutenant adjutant company commander, were killed, wounded, or captured. One machine gun was seized. The remaining enemy fled back to Anyi in disarray.
　　[Our Newspaper Taiyue, 26th] The masses in the Jiang area of Linfen, unable to bear the exploitation by the Jiang bandits, have been constantly fleeing to our area recently. For example, in Jiade Village, 12 li away from Linfen City, there are now 40 to 50 households who have brought their old and young and fled to a certain village in our border area. According to the refugees, "After this year's wheat harvest, the Jiang bandits levied three stone and three dou and five sheng of grain for every two taels of silver from the masses, with each stone stipulated to weigh 145 jin. Later, one stone and two dou were added for every two taels of silver. Recently, a second additional grain levy has been imposed, requiring four stone and five dou and five sheng for every two taels, totaling nine stone and five sheng. Such endless donations and taxes have forced the masses to be unable to survive. They urgently hope that our army will go and rescue them."

　　介休张锡满民兵轮战队
  　击退抢粮阎军一个团
    【本报太岳二十五日电】张锡满轮战队，配合县大队以少敌十余倍之兵力，击退出犯抢粮之阎军一个团。十五日上午，介休城阎军七三师二十九团全部及二一七团一个营，附迫击炮两门，重机枪三挺，向我七区后山庄、赵家窑进犯抢粮，县大队与张锡满轮战队闻讯，即配合赵家窑，上梁两村民兵予敌迎头痛击。张锡满轮战一分队及赵家窑上梁民兵，更发挥马蜂战术，四面蜂涌而来，将敌重重包围，敌虽以迫击炮、重机枪密集炮火轰击，但无法冲出重围，激战四小时，敌不支而退。计毙敌党连长各一名，士兵两名，伤敌六名，我毫无损伤。
    【本报太岳二十六日电】被困于安邑之阎顽保警队一百二十余人，日来因粮食恐慌，四出抢粮，被我猗氏、万泉独立营，于二十一日在南北张村（运城西北十五里）设伏，拂晓该敌至该村，中我埋伏，经三十分钟战斗，毙伤俘敌中尉副官连长以下十七名，缴获机枪一挺，余敌狼狈窜回安邑。
    【本报太岳二十六日电】临汾蒋区群众，不堪蒋贼苛榨，近不断逃来我区。如距临汾城十二里远的贾得村，现已有四五十户全家扶老携幼逃进我边沿区某某村一带居住。据难民说：“今年麦收后，蒋贼向群众每两粮银派正粮三石三斗五升，每石规定一百四十五斤重，以后每两粮银又附加一石二斗。最近第二次附加粮又已派出，每两要粮四石五斗五升，共计已派九石零五升，这种没有尽止的捐税，逼使群众无法生存，他们迫切希望我军去解救他们。
