Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 4th. Shanghai newspapers reveal: The people's armed forces on Hainan Island are growing stronger daily. Chiang the Thief, at the end of his rope, has recently announced the following so-called Ten Killing Commandments, filled with bloodshed: 1. Those who communicate with "bandits" (referring to the people's armed forces) for "bandits" will be killed. 2. Those who harbor "bandits" will be killed. 3. Those who know of "bandits" but do not report them will be killed. 4. Those who conscript soldiers for "bandits" will be killed. 5. Those who pay grain to "bandits" will be killed. 6. Those who pay taxes to "bandits" will be killed. 7. Those who send intelligence to "bandits" will be killed. 8. Those who propagandize for "bandits" will be killed. 9. Those who destroy highways and bridges or steal and destroy telegraph poles will be killed. 10. If one household within five households commits any of the above, the others should stop them or report them; otherwise, all will be killed together. Under Chiang the Thief's bloody oppression, the people are rising up in resistance, answering Chiang the Thief's slaughter with even more heroic struggle.
