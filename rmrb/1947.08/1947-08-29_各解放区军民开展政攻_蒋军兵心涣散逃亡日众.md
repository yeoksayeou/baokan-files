　　Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 27th. Comprehensive war report for the week of August 21st to 27th: Following the victory on the periphery of Yulin in the Northwest theater, another major victory has been achieved. Hu Zongnan, in a rush to rescue the isolated forces in Yulin, hastily divided his troops into three routes to advance deep into Mizhi, committing a major military blunder and providing an excellent opportunity for the Northwest People's Liberation Army to annihilate the enemy. On the 20th of this month, our People's Liberation Army, after a day of fierce fighting at Shajiadian, 70 li north of Mizhi, annihilated the 36th Division, one of Hu's three main forces, a scale unprecedented in the Northwest theater. Since the end of May and early July, after the Northwest People's Liberation Army severely damaged the Ningqing Three Ma Hui troops in Longdong and Sanbian, the reporter pointed out that the Chiang-Hu troops invading the border areas were in an even more isolated position. The People's Liberation Army, after defeating these accomplices of Hu, had won favorable conditions for completely eliminating Hu Zongnan's bandit troops in the future. Historical predictions have proven accurate, and now Hu Zongnan is reaping the bitter fruit of his actions. Due to the annihilation of Chiang-Hu's direct line 36th Division, Hu Zongnan's total force in northern Shaanxi is only fourteen brigades. The mobile force will not exceed seven brigades, and the emptiness of Chiang-Hu's rear will provide opportunities for the development of extensive guerrilla warfare. This situation is just as our reporter pointed out: the Northwest war situation has fundamentally changed. The annihilation of Chiang-Hu's 36th Division marks the beginning of the counter-offensive of the Northwest People's Liberation Army, and also the beginning of a new stage in the liberation of the Great Northwest, and it coordinates with the counter-offensives on all fronts across the country. On the Jin-Cha-Ji battlefield, just as the Central News Agency was dreaming of victory in the "encirclement and suppression" of Pingjinbao, our People's Liberation Army recovered Zhengding City on the 24th in one fell swoop. Local troops and militia are even more active in the Pingjinbao triangular area and the outskirts of Shicun and Taiyuan, containing more than 30,000 Chiang, Fu, and Yan troops, and severely打击 striking the Chiang-Fu troops invading central Hebei. Even the Americans cannot deny that Chiang Kai-shek cannot secure one mile of railway. In western Rehe, local armed forces defeated the Chiang army's 98th Division of the 13th Army, which invaded from Luanping at the beginning of the month, killing and wounding more than 300 of them. In mid-August, Jin-Sui local armed forces resolutely and unexpectedly raided and recovered Xiangning City and Puxian City, which also returned to the people for the third time.

　　This week, because the People's Liberation Army's iron fists have left Chiang's troops helpless and their steps disordered, even the American "master" Wedemeyer, before leaving, had to say that Chiang's bandits were "陷于 caught in a despicable defeatism, which is truly discouraging," and that "military force itself will not be able to eliminate communism." Under Chiang Kai-shek's increasingly severe military crisis, coupled with the strong political offensives launched by the People's Liberation Army, local democratic governments, and militia, Chiang's soldiers have deserted in droves to join the People's Liberation Army. Of the 10,000 Chiang's "Homecoming Corps" besieged in Ye Ting City in Central China, 5,000 have come over after being persuaded. Under our political offensive, desertions from Chiang's army are also increasing. A Chiang's army deserter from Anhui in Central China, after getting lost and being caught, had his regimental commander convene a general assembly of all officers and soldiers and bury him alive in public. But before his death, he remained bravely unyielding and shouted: "Brothers, I took the wrong road. I shouldn't have gone southwest. If I had gone northeast, I would have found the New Fourth Army." After this lesson, another Chiang's army deserter, Du Caiming, was able to safely reach the New Fourth Army after killing three patrolmen. In Jin-Sui, desertions from Yan and Fu's armies are also increasing daily, with more than 500 people having been accommodated in the past two months. In central Hebei, our Rongding (newly established county between Rongcheng and Dingxing) county government has specially set up a Chiang's army veteran reception center, which has accommodated more than 120 people in eight days, and more than 20 people in the past five days. When Chiang's puppet troops scurried into Wangdu and Dingxian, soldiers took the opportunity to flee in droves. The Political Department of the Third Sub-district of Jin-Cha-Ji alone accommodated 90 people in four days. The Political Department of the Jin-Ji-Lu-Yu Military Region is also launching a powerful political offensive to disintegrate the remnants of Chiang's army in western Shandong, northern Henan, and southern Shanxi, which are surrounded by our army and whose morale is collapsing. The increasing number of deserters from Chiang's army more clearly demonstrates the dead end of Chiang Kai-shek's rule.

### 各解放区军民开展政攻　蒋军兵心涣散逃亡日众

专栏：一周综合战报

　　各解放区军民开展政攻　蒋军兵心涣散逃亡日众
    【新华社陕北二十七日电】八月二十一日至二十七日一周综合战报：西北战场紧接榆林外围胜利之后，又获大捷。胡宗南为援救榆林孤军，匆匆分兵三路深入米，却犯了兵家大忌，给西北人民解放军以绝妙歼敌良机。本月二十日，我人民解放军于米脂北七十里之沙家店经一日激战，歼胡部三大主力之一的三十六师，其规模在西北战场说确是空前的。自五月尾至七月初，西北人民解放军在陇东与三边痛歼宁青三马回军之后，记者即会指出侵犯边区的蒋胡军已处于更孤立地位，人民解放军在击溃胡逆这批帮凶以后，就赢得了今后全部消灭胡宗南匪军的优越条件，历史的预见一点不爽，现在胡宗南已在自食苦果。由于蒋胡嫡系三十六师的被歼，胡宗南在陕北的全部兵力只剩十四个旅，能机动的兵力再不会超过七个旅，而蒋胡后方的空虚将给广大游击战争发展良机。这一形势正如本社记者所指出：西北战局已根本改变，蒋胡三十六师的被歼标志着西北人民解放军反攻的开始，也是解放大西北新阶段的开始，并配合了全国各战场的反攻。在晋察冀战场，正当中央社梦平津保“清剿”胜利之时，我人民解放军于廿四日一举收复了正定城，地方部队与民兵更活跃于平津保三角地区及石村、太原外围，牵制蒋傅阎军三万余，并严重打击了进犯冀中的蒋傅军，连美国人也不能不承认蒋介石确保不了一哩铁路。在热西，地方武装于月初击溃由滦平出犯的蒋军十三军九十八师，毙伤其三百余。晋绥地方武装于八月中旬果敢奇袭下收复乡宁城、蒲县城亦第三次回到人民手中。
    本周来由于各战场解放军的铁拳打得蒋军脚手无措，步调零乱，以至连美国“主子”魏德迈也不得不于临去之时，说出蒋帮匪徒“陷于可鄙之失败主义，言之诚令人丧气”，以及“军事力量本身将不能消灭共产主义”之类丧气话。在蒋介石军事危机日益深重之下，加上人民解放军与各地民主政府以及民兵强大的政治攻势的开展。蒋军士兵纷纷逃亡，投奔解放军。华中围困于叶挺城的一万蒋记“还乡团”，经劝说先后来归者已有五千人。在我政治攻势下，蒋军的逃亡也日益众多，华中蒋军一皖籍逃兵因迷路被抓回去之后，蒋军团长召集全团官兵大会，当众将他活埋。但他在临死前仍英勇不屈大呼：“弟兄们，我走错了路，不该向西南走，要向东北走就能找到新四军”。经此教训，蒋军另一逃兵杜才明就能于击毙三名巡逻队后，安然到达新四军。在晋绥，阎、傅军逃亡也日见众多，最近二个月内收容了五百多人。在冀中，我容定（新设县在容城定兴间），县府特设了蒋军退伍收容所，八天中收容了百二十余人，最近五天又收容了二十余人。蒋伪军窜扰望都、定县时，士兵乘机纷纷逃跑，仅晋察冀三分区政治部四天中即收容了九十名。晋冀鲁豫军区政治部也正发动强大政治攻势，以瓦解陷入我军重围、军心涣散的鲁西、豫北、晋南残留蒋军。蒋军逃亡日众已更显著地表现出蒋介石统治的穷途末路了。
