In the past few years, mutual aid in the Fourth District of Heshun has stagnated at its current stage and has been unable to develop. The reasons are that it is not voluntary, the equivalence is unreasonable, and there are problems with the leadership of cadres. If it is not rectified, mutual aid will collapse. Based on this situation, only by boldly emphasizing voluntariness and reorganizing mutual aid can there be new development and creation. The rectification of mutual aid in the entire district during weeding was based on this principle.

Before rectifying mutual aid, a meeting of village cadres from the entire district was held to mobilize them on the significance of rectifying mutual aid, so that each village cadre had a clear understanding of this work. At the same time, it was used to resolve the cadres' mistaken understanding of rectifying mutual aid. For example, some were afraid that the organization would not be able to be re-established after it was disbanded, and some were isolated because of their own problems. However, everyone criticized this idea, believing that cadres must set an example. If they work hard, they will be supported by the masses. After most of the cadres had a clear understanding of their thinking, they began to act. However, in actual practice, two different approaches occurred, and the results were also different. The first approach was to grasp the key link of ideological leadership, first open up the thinking of cadres and activists, and induce discussion on the following two questions. First, what are the advantages and disadvantages of organizing ourselves in the past few years, and how are they caused? Second, what benefits have we gained, and what losses have we suffered? Free thinking was launched, and everyone was encouraged to say what they had to say, and further developed to each team to open up everyone's thinking.

During the mass deliberation, Zhao Wanming of Qingcheng said: There have been many benefits to the labor exchange group in the past few years. Isn't our wealth based on the labor exchange group? To be honest, without the labor exchange group, we would have been poor long ago, and the land would have been barren. In the past few years, many work days have been missed due to business trips, participation in the war, and meetings, but the land has not been barren and can be planted and weeded early. Isn't this obvious? However, some speculative elements in the group took advantage of the group, causing dissatisfaction. For example, so-and-so is very lazy in the group, and the equivalent wage owed for three years has not yet been paid to others, which is bad. So-and-so said: In the past few years, it is because of these few sharp and lazy people who are speculative and opportunistic that our entire labor exchange group has become ununited and unmotivated. If you think about it, who is different? Who doesn't have one heart? After suffering once, who can continue to suffer? These are the people who suffer losses, and they are the ones who take advantage! I think the reason why it is not good every year is here. If we kick them out and freely unite, we can do a good job. Another group member said: We also have problems with equivalence. For example, cadres who arrive late at the field receive the same points as those who go early, causing dissatisfaction in the group, and no one dares to say anything, making mutual aid unmotivated. Finally, the masses proposed that we don't want sharp, lazy, speculative, and opportunistic people, and we will reorganize voluntarily. The leadership accepted the opinions of the masses and called for reorganization and free association, and put forward three guarantees: First, guarantee that honest farmers will be the masters; second, after voluntary association in groups, guarantee that lazy, sharp, speculative, and opportunistic elements will not be assigned to the group; third, for lazy, sharp, speculative, and opportunistic elements, emphasize that they consciously and voluntarily reorganize. As a result, the masses said happily, "This is great!" Those sharp, lazy, speculative, and opportunistic elements who have truly transformed after being isolated can still rejoin the group. So-and-so, a sharp person in Tuling, expressed his determination to correct himself in the group, and everyone let him return to the old group. Now he is performing very well and working hard.

After the new organization was established, there was a new atmosphere in the work. As soon as they heard about the meeting, they arrived automatically and quickly, and the tasks were completed smoothly. Zhang Xike, the captain of so-and-so village, said: "It is easier to be a captain now. As soon as you call for a task, it can be completed immediately." Liu Shanlin said: "It is easier to be a group leader now. First, let everyone speak. As long as you say it, you can do it." Zhao Rulin said: "It feels better to be scolded like this, especially after driving out the landlords, it is easier to speak." In short, after the mutual aid group was rectified, everyone was happy no matter what they did. There are sixteen villages like this, such as Tuling and Qingcheng.

The second approach, such as in Bai Mucao Village, is that the cadres themselves have problems and dare not lead the self-criticism, let alone let go of voluntariness, for fear of being isolated. Therefore, in letting go of the rectification of mutual aid, they only superficially talked to the masses without leading them to do anything. For example, Jinggang Village regarded letting go as not caring, and disbanded the vast majority of mutual aid groups without leading them to reorganize; while in other villages, they did not know what letting go was for, and regardless of the actual situation, they announced the dissolution of mutual aid groups that were not problematic in the first place. These are all inappropriate. (United Office)

### 和顺四区整顿互助经验

    和顺四区整顿互助经验
    几年来和顺四区互助停留在现阶段上，老不能发展，原因是不自愿，以及在等价上不合理，和干部领导上有毛病，如不加以整顿，互助将会垮台。根据这种情况，只有大胆的放手强调自愿重行结合互助才会有新的发展与创造的，全区互助在锄苗中整顿，便是基于这种原则下进行的。
    整顿互助之前，曾召开全区的村干部会议，对放手整顿互助的意义，做了动员，使每个村干部对这一工作，有明确认识，同时借以解决干部对整顿互助的错误认识。如有的怕解散了组织不起来，有的因自身有毛病被孤立，但大家都批判这种想法，认为干部必须以身作则，如自己踏实劳动，会得到群众拥护的。大部干部思想明确后，便开始进行。但实际行动中却又发生了两种不同作法，其结果也不同。第一种做法是抓住了思想领导的一环，首先打通干部积极分子思想，诱导讨论下面两个问题。一、我们几年来组织起来有些什么的好处，与有些什么坏处，是如何造成的。二、到底沾了些什么光，吃了些什么亏，展开了自由思想，号召大家有啥说啥，并进一步的发展到各组队，打通了每个人的思想。
    群众酝酿中，青城赵万明说：几年来变工组好处很多，咱们的发财还不是凭的变工组来吗，老实说不是变工组来早穷了，地荒了，这几年出差又参战、开会误的工很多，地荒不了，还能早种早锄，这不是明摆的？但因组内有些投机分子光在组内讨便宜，引起不满。如××在组内很懒，三年欠的等价工资，现在还未给人家，这就坏了。×××说：这几年来就是因为他们几个尖头懒汉投机取巧的就把咱们的整个变工组闹的不团结，不起劲了，你想谁不一样，谁不一个心，吃亏吃上一次亏，谁还能常吃下去啦？这些就是吃亏的，他们就是讨便宜的！我看年年闹不好的原因就在这里，把这闹出去光咱们自由结合起来，就能搞好。又××组员说：咱们在等价上也有毛病，如干部迟上地也和早去的一样顶分，闹的组内不满意，也没人敢吭，使的互助不起劲。最后，群众并提出了尖头、懒汉、投机取巧的咱们不要他，咱们重来自愿结合。领导上接受群众意见，号召重来自由结合并提出了三大保证：一、保证给老实农民作主；二、自愿结合小组后，保证不在组内分配懒汉、尖头、投机取巧的分子；三、对懒汉、尖头、投机取巧的分子，强调自觉自愿的来重行结合。这一来群众欢天喜地的说，这可好啦！有尖头、懒汉、投机取巧分子，经孤立后真正转变的还可以重行入组。土岭尖头××在组内表示决心改正，大家又让他回到旧组，现在表现很好干的很有劲。
    新组织成立后，工作上有了新气象，一听开会便自动而迅速的到齐了，完成任务也顺当了，××村队长张喜科说：现在的队长好当了，一号召什么任务马上能完成。刘善林说：组长更好当了，先由大家说只要说出就能做出。赵如林说：这样受几下也气顺，尤其是把地主赶出后，说个话也方便。总之，互助组整顿后，大家不管干甚也合意了，像这样的村有土岭、青城等十六个村。
    第二种做法如柏木槽村，是干部本身有毛病不敢领导检讨，更不敢放手自愿，怕孤立出自己来，所以在放手整顿互助中，只漂浮的向群众谈了一下，没领导去干。如井冈村把放手当做不管，把广大互助组解散了，不去领导重行组织；而在另一些村，则不知放手是为了什么，不顾实际情况，把本来没有问题的互助组宣布解散，这些都是不妥当的。（联合办公室）
