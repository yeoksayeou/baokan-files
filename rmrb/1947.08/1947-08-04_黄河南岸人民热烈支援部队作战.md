The people of Junan, Shanxian, Chengwu, and Dingtao counties south of the Yellow River have enthusiastically joined the war effort and made great contributions. Although the masses in Shanxian and Chengwu are surrounded by enemies on all sides, they were overjoyed when they heard that the People's Liberation Army was coming south. They actively carried out war support work. Except for the masses in the city circles, the villages one mile away from the city all organized village command posts and prepared wheat, firewood, stretchers, and carts. The masses also spontaneously prepared salt, oil, and dried vegetables. Fearing that the enemy would rob them and eat them, they hid them in underground tunnels. The county was originally required to provide one hundred carts and five hundred stretchers, but the masses spontaneously increased it to two hundred carts and eight hundred and fifty stretchers. Jitu Village in the Seventh District of Chengwu was only two miles away from the enemy Liu Shicheng's stronghold. When they were making stretchers, they were afraid that the enemy would come to disturb them, so they carried the wood to the sorghum fields to make them. The people of Junan also organized a war support command post, and men, women, old and young were all mobilized. The young and strong carried stretchers, the old men drove carts, the women ground flour, and the children carried water, weeded, and fed cattle for the families of those participating in the war. After our army arrived, the local area guaranteed sufficient supplies. The whole county quickly supplied the troops with 1.4 million jin of white flour. The women ground flour day and night without stopping for a moment. An old lady in Miao Village was so busy that she was covered in sweat and her eyes were red, but she still said: "I can do it even if I don't sleep for ten days!" The county organized two thousand stretchers to go to the front line. When our army surrounded Dingtao, the county command post was still more than twenty miles away from the troops. It immediately went to negotiate supply issues in the rain. Due to the sufficient preparation, the supply was greatly reduced, which strengthened the combat power.

    黄河南岸人民热烈支援部队作战
    【本报冀鲁豫一日电】黄河以南巨南、单县、城武、定陶等县人民，卷入参战热潮，贡献极大。单县、城武的群众虽然四面受敌，当他们听到人民解放军南下时，欣喜异常，积极进行战勤工作，除城圈里的群众外，其他离城一里路的村子，均组织了村指挥部，准备了麦、柴、担架、大车，群众又自动准备盐油干菜。他们怕敌人抢去吃了，便藏在地道里，本来只要该县出一百辆大车、五百付担架，但群众自动增加到了二百辆大车，八百五十付担架，城武七区吉土集距敌刘士成据点只二里路，他们在做担架时，怕敌人来扰乱，把木料抬到高粱地里去做。巨南人民也组织了战勤指挥部，男女老少一齐动员，青壮年抬担架，老汉们赶大车，妇女们磨面，儿童们给参战人员家属抬水、锄草、喂牛。我大军到达后，当地保证了足够的供给，全县很快即供给部队白面一百四十万斤。妇女们日以继夜，片刻不停的磨面，苗庄一老太太，忙得满身是汗，眼也红了，她还说：“那怕十天不睡觉都成！”该县组织了两千付担架开赴前线，当我大军把定陶包围时，县指挥部离部队还有二十余里，当即冒雨前往商谈供给问题，由于准备的充分，使供给上减少了很多困难，增强了战斗力量。
