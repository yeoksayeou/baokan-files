Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 14th: New York dispatch: On the eve of the "Pan-American Conference" scheduled to be held on August 15th, the United States' unilateral restriction on Cuban sugar imports has aroused a nationwide anti-American wave in Cuba and aroused deep concern among other countries in Central and South America. Since the US Congress passed the Sugar Restriction Act and specifically stipulated a 28% reduction in Cuban sugar imports, the Cuban Ambassador to the United States has repeatedly negotiated with the United States, stating that Cuba will not participate in the "Pan-American Conference" unless the United States takes no anti-Cuban economic actions. However, Truman signed the bill on the 9th regardless. Cuban newspapers unanimously pointed out that the US law is aimed at dealing with Cuba; for Cuba, whose national economy relies on the sugar industry for 80%, this is "an economic threat far more serious than military aggression." Various Cuban political parties and organizations, including the Socialist Party, the Labor United Party, the National Lawyers Association, the Sugar Merchants Association, as well as Foreign Minister Muñoz, Labor Minister Socarrás, and others, have protested against this discriminatory US bill. Cuban Senate Speaker Fernández said: "This action by the United States violates international law and seriously threatens Cuban sovereignty." Fernández pointed out that Cuba will demand that the United States withdraw its troops and return its military bases. Democratic leader Bollinger said: "The new US law proves that the United States is implementing imperialist policies." Many Cuban right-wing newspapers also admitted: "This is a measure to make the Cuban economy subordinate to the United States" and "runs counter to the Good Neighbor Policy promoted by the United States." It is reported that newspapers in other Latin American countries have published the evolution of this matter in prominent positions.

　　美国片面限制古巴蔗糖入口
  　激起古巴反美浪潮
    【新华社陕北十四日电】纽约讯：当“泛美会议”将于八月十五日召开前夕，美国片面限制古巴蔗糖入口的行动，激起古巴全国性的反美浪潮，并引起中南美其他国家的深切注意。自美国会通过限制蔗糖法并具体规定减少古巴食糖入口百分之二十八以来，古巴驻美大使曾数度与美国交涉，并声明除非美国不作反古巴的经济行动，古巴将不参加“泛美会议”。但杜鲁门仍不顾一切于九日签署该法案。古巴报纸对此一致指出，美国此法旨在对付古巴；对于国民经济百分之八十依赖糖业的古巴，这是“远比军事侵略更厉害的经济威胁。”古巴各政党社团，包括社会党、劳工联合党、全国律师协会、糖商协会及外长缪诺兹、劳工部长索卡拉斯等，均纷纷抗议美国此种歧视法案。古巴参院议长菲南德斯称：“美国这种行动，破坏了国际法，严重威胁古巴的主权。”菲氏指出：古巴将要求美国撤退驻军；并归还其军事基地。民主党领袖勃林格称：“美国新法证明美国正在实行帝国主义政策”。许多古巴右翼报纸亦承认：“这是使古巴经济隶属于美国的措施”，“与美国所标榜的睦邻政策相背驰。”据悉，拉丁美洲其他各国报纸均以显著地位刊载此事的演变。
