　　Taipei Studies Topdressing Techniques
　　[Our Dispatch] Under the leadership of heroes Niu Haiyang and Wang Shoude's air squadron, Taipei, Licheng County, has hoed all 424 mu of Golden Queen (a type of melon or squash), 855.5 mu of grain, 307 mu of cotton and bean fields, and corn fields once (cotton has been hoed three times). The Golden Queen has been topdressed with fertilizer once. Each team has also promoted techniques in a timely manner: the Golden Queen is topdressed twice, the local corn is topdressed once, and efforts are being made to topdress the two-row grain fields once. At the same time, everyone recognizes that dry hoeing and wet planting lead to vigorous seedlings; topdressing corn means the roots are seeking fertilizer, not the fertilizer seeking roots; topdressing small seedlings grows stalks; topdressing at tassel emergence grows kernels; dry topdressing uses night soil, wet topdressing uses bean cake; and the hoeing in the hot season is like adding a bowl of oil. All the village's labor force is involved in the seedling nourishing movement. According to statistics from the 3rd, 157 mu of Golden Queen have been topdressed twice, and 86 mu of local corn have been topdressed. The cotton has all been pruned. Several seedling protection techniques have been derived in the process: (1) Bean cake is applied to grain by spreading it along the rows, five cakes per mu, followed by another hoeing, and the soil will loosen in a few days. (2) When topdressing corn, dig pits around the corn in the shape of a cake, and put the fertilizer in it, so that the corn can easily absorb the fertilizer. (3) When hoeing, pay attention to hoeing soil mounds to protect the seedlings, which can nourish the land. (4) When the corn seedlings are small, the topdressing should be closer, and when the corn seedlings are larger, the distance should be farther (more than four fingers away).

　　台北研究追肥技术
    【本报讯】黎城台北在英雄钮海羊及王守德飞机大队带领下，全村四二四亩金皇后、八五五·五亩谷、三○七亩棉花及豆地、玉茭均普遍锄过一次（棉花锄过三次）。金皇后已普遍奶过一次。各队又及时推广技术，金皇后奶二次，土玉茭奶一次，两垄谷争取普遍奶一次，同时大家都认识了干锄湿耩禾苗旺盛，奶玉茭是根找肥，不是肥找根，小苗奶长秆；吐红缨时奶长籽，干奶圊肥湿奶饼，伏里耨一碗油等，全村劳力都卷入奶苗运动。据三日统计金皇后一五七亩奶了二次，土玉茭奶了八六亩，棉花都修打了。在进行中得出几点保苗技术：（一）麻饼奶谷按垄撒，一亩五个饼，接着再去锄一次，不几日土即发松。（二）奶玉茭将玉茭四周扒成饼熬形的池，把肥放里，这样玉茭容易吸收肥料。（三）耨地时注意耨土堆，保护禾苗，能养垧。（四）玉茭苗小时上追肥宜近些，玉茭苗大了要距离远点（四指以外）。（保苗渡荒报）
