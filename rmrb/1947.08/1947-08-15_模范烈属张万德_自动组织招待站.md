　　Model Martyr's Family Member Zhang Wande
  　Automatically Organizes Reception Station
    [Report from this newspaper, Xingtai] Zhang Wande, a martyr's family member from Daweiyu in the Tenth District, heard that a large number of carts were going to the front lines to transport public grain. He discussed with the village cadres about boiling water for the grain transporters and organizing a reception station. At first, firewood was scarce, so he carried the four to five hundred catties of dry firewood stored at home to the river beach. When the masses saw Wande carrying firewood, they also sent firewood to the reception station. Because of the drought, there was no water in the river, so he went to fetch water half a mile away by himself. He boiled the water early, and then scooped the boiling water out to cool it in bowls and buckets. When he saw carts approaching from afar, he would shout and call them to drive the carts to the shade of the trees to rest and drink water. The grain transporters said with emotion: The base area is just like one big family. Wande said: We are all doing the same thing. We won't rest until we defeat Chiang Kai-shek. (Li Zhiguo)

　　模范烈属张万德
  　自动组织招待站
    【本报邢台讯】十区大苇峪烈属张万德听到有大批大车要往前方运公粮，他就和村干部商量给运粮人烧水，组织一个招待站。开始柴火困难，自己把家里存的四五百斤干柴扛到河滩，群众看到万德扛柴，也都往招待站送柴去，天旱河里没水，他一个人跑到半里地以外担水，早早把水浇开，又把开水掏出来凉到碗里和桶里，远远看见赶车的就喊叫，把车赶到树底下休息喝水；运粮的人感动的说：根据地就是一家人。万德说：咱大家办的是一样事，什时打垮蒋介石才歇心。（李治国）
