　　Add More Oxen, Deep Ploughing, and Fine Harrowing: Strive for Each Person to Harvest Five Dou of Wheat
    Jize Plans to Plant Wheat on Sixty Percent of Cultivated Land
    [Our Correspondent Group Dispatch on the 27th] The main task in Jize at present is to prepare for wheat planting. The entire county plans to plant 270,000 mu of wheat, accounting for 61 percent of the cultivated land area, striving for each person to harvest five dou of wheat. The masses are now actively turning the soil, half of which is reserved for wheat (only planting wheat). It has been ploughed twice, and efforts are being made to plough all of it twice. Wu Guanying Village has decided to plant more than 2,500 mu of wheat, averaging 2.5 mu per person. Under the leadership of the famous labor hero, Wen Zhang, 1,000 mu of reserved wheat land has been ploughed twice and is now beginning to be ploughed a third time. All 50 mu of wasteland in the village are also being prepared for ploughing and planting wheat. The biggest difficulty in planting wheat is the lack of animal power. The village plans to add more than a dozen oxen before planting wheat, currently having fifty, to achieve the goal of "one ox per qing of land." Manure composting is also being actively carried out. According to the experience of the masses, green manure composted in pigsties does not produce grass seeds or attract mole crickets when applied to the fields. Therefore, special attention is paid to increasing pig manure. The village has a total of fifty pigs, and more than fifty households in the village plan to buy pigs, with Ma Yuhan, Wu Yuchang, and others having already bought twelve. Because of the local shortage of pigs, everyone is discussing going to Guangzong collectively to purchase a batch. Many people are digging manure pits, and at least 1,000 cartloads of manure can be obtained before wheat planting. (Li Hang)

　　添买耕牛深垡细犁　争取每人收麦五斗
    鸡泽计划耕地百分之六十种麦
    【本报记者团二十七日电】鸡泽目前的主要工作是准备种麦。全体计划种麦二十七万亩，占耕地面积百分之六十一，争取每人收麦五斗。群众现正积极翻地，半数留麦地（只种麦子）。已翻过两遍，正努力争取全部翻两遍。吴官营村决定种麦两千五百余亩，每人合二亩半。在著名劳动英雄文章领导下，已将一千亩留麦地犁完两遍，正开始犁三遍。全村五十亩荒地亦准备犁过种麦。种麦最大困难是畜力缺乏，该村准备种麦前再添十几个牛，现有五十个，达到“顷地一牛”的目标。沤粪亦在积极进行。根据群众经验，在猪圈里沤的青草粪，上到地里，草籽不生，蝼蛄不串。因之特别注意增加猪肥。该村共有猪五十只，全村已有五十多户计划买猪，马玉寒、吴玉昌等已买了十二只。当地猪缺，大家商量要集体赴广宗去贩一批。许多人都在挖粪坑，种麦前起码可弄一千车粪。（力航）
