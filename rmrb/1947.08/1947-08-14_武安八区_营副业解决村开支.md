　　Wu'an Eighth District

　　Developing Sideline Occupations to Solve Village Expenses

　　[Our Newspaper] As a result of Wu'an Eighth District's efforts to reorganize village finances over the past six months, twelve of the district's forty-seven villages have completely achieved self-sufficiency in village public offices, primary schools, armed forces, etc.; another fifteen villages have achieved semi-self-sufficiency, and thirteen villages have prepared production funds. The villages have established a total of fifty-two small factories, workshops, cooperatives, melon patches, etc. to solve village expenses. There are also various avenues such as mending pots, transportation, and selling fertilizer. According to the semi-annual summary (referring to the lunar calendar), the total village funds amounted to 13.67 million yuan, with a profit of 6.91 million yuan already obtained. Dahezhuang Farmers' Association Chairman Hui Xiu is skilled at repairing carts, so he and carpenter Wei Shuangquan opened a small iron and woodworking factory, specializing in providing villages with repaired carts, custom-made spinning wheels, and farm tools at low prices. On the one hand, this solved the difficulties of farmers in various villages, and on the other hand, it earned money for the village, while they themselves did not take a single cent, declaring that it was entirely "serving the people" and used for village expenses. Diantou Village sold the village's scrap copper and iron and bought two donkeys, specializing in plowing the fields for households without labor, solving the difficulties of many households without labor. In the first half of the year, they earned more than 134,000 yuan, which was more than enough to cover village-level expenses. They also plan to transport coal in the future. Chongyi Village borrowed two cows last winter to open an oil mill (the masses do not use cows in the winter and still have to feed them grass, so they are willing to lend them out). They earned a lot of money in three months, so they bought two cows themselves and continued to save money and work hard day and night. They have now earned one million yuan, and after deducting 210,000 yuan for expenses, the remainder is used as a fund to expand production and solve the village's financial difficulties. These methods and cadres have been warmly supported by the masses.

　　武安八区
  　营副业解决村开支
    【本报讯】武安八区半年来努力整理村财政的结果，全区四十七村，已有十二村的村公所、小学校、武装等完全做到生产自给；另十五村做到半自给，十三村准备好了生产基金。各村为解决村开支而开办的小型工厂、作坊、合作社、瓜地等共计五十二处。还有补锅、运输、卖垧等各种门路。半年总结（按指阴历），各村基金一三六七万元，已得利六九一万元。大贺庄农会主席会修大车，就和木匠魏双全二人开了个小铁木工厂，专门贱价给各村条理大车、订制纺车、农具等，一方面解决了各村农民困难，一方面给本村赚了钱，自己却一文不要，申明完全是“为人民服务”，作村开支用。店头村卖了村里的废铜烂铁，买了两个驴，专给无劳力户犁地，解决了许多无劳力户困难，前半年赚洋十三万四千余元，足供村级开支而有余，将来还准备运煤。崇义村去年冬天借了两条牛开油坊（群众冬天不用牛，闲着还得喂草料，故愿出借），三个月赚了不少钱，乃自买二牛，继续省吃俭用，白天黑夜的干，现已赚洋一百万元，除开支二十一万元外，余数作为基金，扩大生产解决村经费困难。这些办法与干部，都得到群众热烈拥护。
