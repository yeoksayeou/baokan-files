　　Branch Mobilizes Cadres to Take the Lead
  　Hua County Rushes to Plant for Famine Relief
    [This dispatch from our newspaper in the border region of Hebei, Shandong and Henan, dated the 11th] Hua County has launched a campaign to rush to plant for famine relief. Since the beginning of spring, the county has not had a thorough rain for several months, and most areas have suffered from drought, resulting in many spring seedlings not being planted. On the 25th of last month, there was a thorough rain, and the leadership called for planting late seedlings. The masses in Luzhai Village, in the third district, initially complained that planting was too slow and feared that mole crickets would bite the seedlings, making the planting futile. The branch mobilized at a village-wide meeting, saying, "The mole crickets will never be completely eliminated. Even if some seedlings are lost, we can still reap a third of the harvest. If we don't plant, we have no hope." After hearing this, everyone changed their minds and said, "That's absolutely right. If we don't rush to plant, I think we have no hope of survival?" Following the lead of the cadres, a competition was launched, with over 1,000 mu of sweet potatoes planted by carrying water and 103 mu of corn planted. The entire village mobilized and planted more than 6,500 mu of vacant land in two days. More than 300 of the village's 500 households are already eating wild vegetables in exchange for coarse grains. Village cadre Gan in Baliying Village first planted 38 mu of autumn seedlings. The mole crickets only bit two mu, and he used this example to educate the masses, giving the whole village the confidence to work hard. Under the leadership of Li Aimin, the director of the peasant association in Zhongshang Village, a group of 18 laborers planted more than 40 mu in two days, promoting the entire village to rush to plant. In Xu Wuying in the ninth district, 80 households in 12 mutual aid groups have planted 150 mu of sweet potatoes and 50 mu of corn. Each person also saves two he of grain per day. The entire village of 400 people can save 8,000 he per day; by not smoking or drinking, they save 4,000 yuan per day. Sixty-one militiamen in Cuizhai, who are on night sentry duty, declared that they would not eat public supplies, saving 60 jin of flour and 610 yuan for vegetable money every day, reducing the burden on the village. Xiao Village in the second district used the extra water from digging wells to plant 67 mu on the first day, preparing to complete a ten-day crash task in six days. Erni, the 13-year-old leader of the Sisters' Brigade in Huangzhuang Village, Sixth District, carried water for planting. Because the land was far away, she carried more than 20 loads of water every half-day.

　　支部动员干部带头
  　滑县抢种备荒
    【本报冀鲁豫十一日电】滑县展开抢种备荒运动。该县入春以来，数月未下透雨，大部地区遭旱，致春苗多未下种。上月二十五日下了一场透雨，领导上号召点种晚苗。三区路砦村群众开始嫌点种太慢，怕蝼蛄咬苗，种上也白搭。支部在全村大会上动员说：“总是咬不完，见苗三分收，不种没盼头。”大家听后转过弯来，都说：“一点不假，要是不抢种，我看咱盼没？”随着干部带头，掀起竞赛，担水栽红薯一千多亩，点玉蜀黍一百零三亩，全村总动员，两天种了六千五百多亩白地。全村五百多户已有三百多户吃野菜换杂粮。八里营村干先种了三十八亩秋苗，蝼蛄只咬了两亩，拿实例教育了群众，全村都有信心的干起来了。冢上村在农会主任李爱民带头下，一组十八个劳动力两天种了四十多亩，推动了全村都抢种起来。九区徐五营八十户十二个互助组，已栽红薯一百五十亩，点种玉蜀黍五十亩，每人每天并节约粮食二合，全村四百口人，每天可节省八千合；不吸烟不喝酒，每天省钱四千元。崔砦六十一个民兵，夜间站岗，声明不吃公家给养，每天省面六十斤，菜金六百一十元，减轻了村负担。二区肖村利用淘井时多出的水，第一天种六十七亩，准备六天完成十天的突击任务。六区黄庄村姊妹团长二妮只十三岁，挑水点种，因地远，每晌担水二十多担。
