　　Liu Enpei's Family Long-Term Plan
  　Formulating a Full-Year Savings Plan
    [Our Newspaper, Wu'an News] Liu Enpei, a model farmer from Qian Berlin Village, Wu'an Seventh District, who has turned over a new leaf, is taking a long-term approach. After precise calculations, he has formulated a full-year savings plan for spinning and weaving, and buying a donkey. His family of five has fifteen mu of land. Last year, they harvested six shi of grain. Before the call for savings on May (lunar calendar), the whole family ate four and a half jin of rice per day. On May 11th, they checked and found only 250 jin of grain remaining. From the 12th, they strictly saved, eating only three jin per day. It is estimated that they can eat until the seventh day of the eighth lunar month. During this period, three women spin cotton, collectively handing in thirteen liang of thread (the rest belongs to the individual). They can get a total of sixty-three jin, earning five jin of rice per jin, totaling 315 jin, which can be eaten from the seventh day of the eighth lunar month to the twenty-second day of the eleventh lunar month. During this period, they can spin another eighty-eight jin, earning four hundred and forty jin of rice, which can be eaten from the twenty-second day of the eleventh lunar month to the nineteenth day of the fifth lunar month of next year. During this last period, they can spin another ninety-nine jin, earning four hundred and ninety-five jin of rice. This item alone is enough to buy a donkey. The money he earns from carrying poles and chopping wood is not even included. This kind of phased planning greatly encourages the whole family's production enthusiasm. (Ting Bi)

　　刘恩佩家长期打算
  　订出全年节约计划
    【本报武安讯】武安七区前柏林村翻身农民节约模范刘恩佩从长期着手，经过精确计算，订出全年节约纺织与买驴计划。他家五口人，十五亩地，去年打粮六石，今年五月（阴）号召节约前，每天全家吃米四斤半。五月十一检查，余粮只二百五十斤。从十二日起，严格节约，每天只吃三斤。预计能吃到八月初七。这期间三个妇女纺花，每天共能交家十三两线（其余归个人）。共能得六十三斤，每斤赚五斤米，共三一五斤，又可从八月初七吃到十一月二十二。在这期间又能纺八十八斤，赚四百四十斤米，可从十一月二十二吃到明年五月十九。在最后这一期间，又能纺九十九斤，赚四百九十五斤米。光这一项，即可买驴一个。他自己抬砍赚钱尚未计入。这样逐段计划，大大鼓舞了全家的生产热情。（廷璧）
