　　Shahe Seizes Gaps in Weeding to Plow Wasteland and Prepare for Wheat Planting
　　[Our Correspondent Group, 15th Dispatch] The masses in Shahe are seizing gaps in weeding to fully eliminate wasteland. The sixth and seventh districts have eliminated 26,000 mu, most of which has been planted with buckwheat and vegetables, and some land is awaiting wheat planting. Adding the achievements of other districts, it is estimated that the county's 40,000 mu of wasteland has been largely eliminated. During the enemy's occupation, many farmers abandoned their land and fled due to heavy burdens, resulting in some wasteland in each village. After Shahe's liberation, from anti-traitor revenge to land reform, some land was either not distributed in time, or although it had been distributed, the peasants who received the land lacked labor and livestock, and were unable to plant wheat, leading to wasteland (wasteland accounts for about one-thirteenth of the county's current 520,000 mu of cultivated land). This spring, rainfall was scarce, and the masses were busy carrying water to plant existing cultivated land, so these wastelands were not able to be cultivated in time. After a thorough rain at the end of last month, the leadership called on the entire county to fully and urgently rush to plant all wasteland, stipulating that there would be no burden on the harvest from wasteland. Under the leading influence of village cadres, wasteland reclamation in Shahe has become a movement. Wasteland that has been deserted for a shorter time is immediately planted with buckwheat and vegetables; wasteland that has been deserted for a longer time, with weeds growing to the belly, must be plowed several times during the hot season to rot the weeds before wheat can be planted this year.

　　[Our Tunliu Dispatch] Tunliu is slightly dry this year. After a thorough rain recently, autumn crops are thriving. The county party committee has called for increasing grain production from a comprehensive and long-term perspective, and a surge in production is now sweeping the county. A three-time weeding campaign is underway, along with topdressing, and each person is increasing the planting of autumn vegetables by three fen, striving for an eight-tenths harvest on a six-tenths year. Of the 30,000 mu of fertile wasteland in the county that was abandoned due to enemy destruction, efforts are being made to sow wheat fields, except for land unsuitable for wheat growth; old wheat fields are plowed twice, fertilized with 30 dan, and fully sown. Mutual aid teams in each village are rushing to plow wheat fields. The wheat fields in Luocun and Yuancun have been completely plowed, two-thirds of Gaodian have been plowed, and the wasteland in Liujiaping and other villages has been completely plowed. To ensure the completion of the task, most villages are rectifying mutual aid organizations, settling work accounts, clearing wages, and absorbing a large amount of auxiliary labor into agricultural production. The government also stipulates that wasteland will not be burdened for two years; villages with a lot of wasteland can let villages with more labor cultivate it if they cannot cultivate it themselves. Cadres at all levels are striving to perform meritorious service for the people in the production increase movement. (Guang Ju)
　　[Our Taiyue 15th Dispatch] After overcoming complacency after the rain, Fushan, Qinshui, Gaoping, Tunliu and other counties are making every effort to eliminate wasteland and rush to plant buckwheat, rapeseed, and radishes. In Fancun, the location of the labor hero Shi Zhenming in Fushan, a brigade meeting was held on the 29th of last month. Shi Zhenming called for the elimination of fertile wasteland and the replanting of late autumn vegetables. Some people disagreed on the spot: "Our village listened to you this year and planted early, and the seedlings have all taken root, so there is no need to replant now." "Buckwheat is all old seeds, who knows if it will work or not." After Shi Zhenming patiently persuaded and introduced methods for improving seeds, everyone was mobilized to launch a competition to eliminate fertile wasteland and replant. From the 1st to the 4th, in three days, they rushed to plow and plant 210 mu of fertile wasteland.

　　沙河抓紧锄苗间隙
  　犁荒准备种麦
    【本报记者团十五日电】沙河群众抓紧锄苗间隙，全力消灭荒地，六七两区已消灭两万六千亩，大部种上荞麦、菜，一部地待种麦。加上其他各区成绩，估计全县四万亩荒地，已大体消灭。在敌寇盘踞期间，由于负担苛重，许多农民弃地逃荒，各村都有若干荒地。沙河解放后，从反奸复仇，到土地改革，有些土地或未及时分配，或虽已分配，但得地群众劳力畜力缺乏，未能种上麦子以致荒芜（荒地约占全县现耕地五十二万亩的十三分之一）。今春雨水缺乏，群众忙于担水点种现耕地，这些荒地就没来得及整理。上月底落了透雨，领导上号召全县全力紧急抢种全部荒地，规定荒地收获不负担。在村干部带头影响下，沙河开荒遂成运动。荒芜时间较短者，随即种上荞麦、菜；荒芜时间较长的，蒿长及腹，须在伏天连犁数遍，把蒿草沤烂，今年才可种麦。（李庄）
    【本报屯留讯】屯留今年稍旱，最近普落透雨后，秋禾旺盛。县委号召从全面长期着眼，增加粮食，现全县掀起了增产热潮。突击锄三遍苗并上追肥，每人增种三分秋菜，做到六分年成八分收。全县因敌伪摧残破坏而荒芜了的三万亩熟荒，除不适于麦子生长的土地外，争取播种麦田；老麦地犁两遍施肥三十担全部播种。各村互助组都突击垡麦地，罗村、原村麦地已全部犁完，高店犁过三分之二，刘家坪等村荒地已全部犁完。为保证任务的完成，各村大都进行整顿互助组织，清算工帐，清结工资，吸收大量副劳动力参加农业生产。政府并规定荒地二年不负担；荒地多的村子自己种不了让给劳动力多的村子耕种。各级干部都争取在增产运动中为民立功。（广居）
    【本报太岳十五日电】浮山、沁水、高平、屯留等县，在克服雨后自满情绪后，全力消灭荒地，赶种荞麦、油菜、萝卜。浮山劳动英雄石振明所在地的范村，上月二十九日举行大队会议，石振明号召消灭熟荒，补种晚秋蔬菜。当场有人表示不同意：“咱村今年听了你的话，种得早，都捉住苗了，现在不要补种了。”“荞麦都是陈籽，谁知管用不管用”。经石振明耐心说服，又介绍了改造种籽的办法，把大家动员起来，展开了消灭熟荒及补种竞赛。从一日到四日三天，就突击刨种熟荒二百一十亩。
