  　Middle and Poor Peasants Unite to Oppose Counter-Settlement
    [Our newspaper, Ji-Lu-Yu, 16th dispatch] In Juancheng's eighth district, the poor peasants of Kangtun took the lead in uniting with the middle peasants to launch a movement against traitors, for revenge, and against counter-settlement. Kangtun has 230 people, and middle peasants account for more than half. After the enemy came, landlords demanded grain from the poor peasants, and at the same time, the middle peasants also suffered great losses. Because the enemy wanted grain and money, the landlords simply did not provide it; the poor peasants had no grain or money, so the middle peasants were extorted. Su Mengguan, a middle peasant with a family of five and nineteen mu of land, paid two bags of sorghum, twenty jin of wheat, and one zhang and two chi of white cloth in less than three months. In addition, he had his new single pants stolen right off his body, and three mu of sorghum was also cut down. Su Mengqin, a middle peasant with a family of five and twenty mu of land, was told by the landlord that he had cooked for the Eighth Route Army. The enemy arrested him and forced him to hand over guns, using all kinds of torture. As a result, he sold his cattle and belongings, and only got out of prison by paying 1.08 million in Chiang Kai-shek notes as a gun fee. Other things, such as the enemy wanting the people to build fortifications, the landlords did not go, and it was the middle and poor peasants who provided the labor. If they did not do well, they would be beaten and bullied. Therefore, the middle peasants' hatred for the landlord class has doubled. After liberation, they actively participated in the movement against traitors and for revenge. The poor peasants of Kangtun paid attention to uniting with the middle peasants in their actions. At a struggle meeting against the landlords, everyone took up revenge sticks and launched a joint revenge struggle against the landlords. Under the leadership of the poor peasants, the middle peasants dared to actively struggle. With the assistance of the middle peasants, the poor peasants also felt stronger and gained a lot of courage. The poor and middle peasants united to accelerate the thorough elimination of the landlords.

　　鄄城康屯
  　中贫联合反倒算
    【本报冀鲁豫十六日电】鄄城八区康屯贫农带头，联合中农，掀起反奸复仇反倒算运动。康屯二百卅的人民，中农占二分之一以上，敌人来后，地主向贫农倒粮，同时中农也受到极大损失。因为敌人要粮要款，地主根本不出，贫农无粮无款，所以中农受勒索。中农苏孟观，五口人，十九亩地，不到三个月即出高粱两布袋，麦子二十斤，白布一丈二尺，另外还被抢去正穿着的新单裤子，三亩高粱也被砍光。中农苏孟秦，五口人，二十亩地，地主说他曾给八路军做过饭，敌人把他抓去，逼着要枪，经施用各种肉刑，结果把牛和东西卖干，拿枪款一百零八万蒋票才出狱。其他如敌要民夫修筑工事，地主不出，都是中贫农出工，弄不好还要挨打受气。所以中农对地主阶级仇恨倍增，解放后，积极参加反奸复仇。康屯贫农于行动中注意联合了中农，一次斗争地主大会上，大家拿起了复仇棍，一齐向地主展开说理复仇斗争。中农在贫农的带领下，敢于积极斗争，贫农在中农的协助下，也感到力量壮大，增加勇气不少，贫农中农联合起来加紧彻底消灭地主。
