Xinhua News Agency, Jin-Cha-Ji, August 26th—A certain local military group in central Hebei, active on both banks of the Yongding River, under the policy of military action serving land reform, directly participated in and supported the land reform work in more than 20 villages in Gu'an and Zhuozhou during combat, consolidating the guerrilla base areas on both banks of the Yongding River. In participating in land reform, the unit stipulated that the political work team of the company would become the “turn-over team,” the political organ would become the guiding organ for land reform, the head of the political work team would be the deputy instructor, and soldiers from each squad would participate, leading all soldiers to mobilize the masses. In villages with county and district cadres, they would cooperate with the local authorities, and the company's political work team would participate in the village's work team for unified leadership. The battalion and regiment would participate in the county's core group. The political work team was divided into publicity, investigation, and security departments according to the specific situation. When necessary, the company's political work teams could be combined into a battalion political work team for unified use of forces. Combining land reform with combat, the unit has gained the following experience: First, stay in one place as long as possible, and when deciding on action, both the enemy situation and the land reform situation must be considered. When the enemy situation is not serious, they should insist on protecting the masses' land reform and attacking the enemy, and take the initiative to attack, so that the enemy does not dare to disturb. When the situation is serious, they should cover the cadres and the masses to transfer, so that no one suffers losses. The troops must also prepare in peacetime, deploy forces in the village to control the landlord's forces, preserve materials, and prepare for returning after the transfer. Second, the main force is concentrated, and some are scattered, which can both work and fight. Or work scattered and camp together, returning at night and going out during the day according to the specific situation, or going out at night and returning during the day. Sometimes hold joint village meetings and large parades to embolden the masses by showing soldiers in every village.

　　冀中某地方兵团
  　加强组织领导　参加土地改革
    【新华社晋察冀二十六日电】活跃永定河两岸之冀中某地方兵团，在军事行动服务于土地改革的方针下，于作战中直接参加与支援了固安、涿县二十余村的土地改革工作，巩固了永定两岸的游击根据地。在参加土地改革中，该部规定连的政工组即成为翻身组，政治机关即为土改工作指导机关，政工组组长为副指导员，各班均有战士参加，带领全体战士发动群众。在有县区干部的村庄，即配合地方进行工作，连政工组参加村的工作组统一领导。营团则参加县的核心组。政工组按具体情况分为宣传、调查、治安等部。必要时连政工组可合组成营政工队统一使用力量。土改与作战结合该部并取得以下经验：一、尽可能在一地久驻，决定行动时必须同时考虑到敌情及土地改革情况，敌情不严重时，应坚持保卫群众土地改革打击敌人，并主动出击，使敌人不敢出扰。严重时即掩护干部与群众转移，不使一人受到损失。部队并须在平时即作准备，布置村中控制地主力量，保存材料，作转移后再来的准备。二、主力集中，部分分散，既能工作又能作战。或分散工作集中宿营，根具体情况昼出夜归，或夜出昼归。有时举行联村大会大游行，使村村见兵为群众壮胆。
