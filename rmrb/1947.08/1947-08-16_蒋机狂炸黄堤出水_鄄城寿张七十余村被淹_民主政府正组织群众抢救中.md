Xinhua News Agency, Jinji Luyu, 14th (Delayed report): The river dyke workers have been subject to frantic bombing by Chiang Kai-shek's aircraft day and night, with several sections already destroyed. By the 4th of this month, 28 villages, including Shisanzhuang and Bagongqiao in the tenth district of Juancheng, had been flooded, leaving 5,600 residents along the river homeless. More than forty villages, including Qianhou Wangjuan, Pinghu, and Qingshuihe in the seventh district of Shouzhang, have also been turned into a watery expanse. The Yellow River rages, houses and fields are gone, and cries of sorrow echo everywhere. Our river defense headquarters immediately organized the masses to transport stones for emergency rescue. However, the Chiang bandits became even more ferocious, increasing the number of aircraft from one or two to eight, carrying out round-the-clock strafing and bombing. From the 4th to the 8th alone, they dropped more than ninety bombs in places such as Zaose Tower in Shouzhang City, Zhangqiu Town, and Sunkou, killing and wounding 27 civilian laborers, including Jiang Chuanbao, who were transporting stones, killing five livestock, and destroying 73 civilian houses. The local democratic government is now organizing the masses to repair and block the breaches at all costs.
