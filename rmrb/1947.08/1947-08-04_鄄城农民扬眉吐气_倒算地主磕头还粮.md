(From our correspondent in the Hebei-Shandong-Henan Border Region, 1st) The anti-reverse-liquidation movement in the Fourth District of Juancheng is vigorously developing. Villagers everywhere welcome the return of wealth and grain to their homes. Landlords play suonas and kowtow to return property and grain. The landlord Sanjimao of Lü Village, because when the Chiang Kai-shek army came, led all the landlords in the village to reverse-liquidate the farmers for land, grain, and belongings. After liberation, the masses demanded the return of their belongings. Farmer Lü Dengzhou said, "When they reversed the grain, they told us to deliver it to their homes. Now we have to make them deliver it to our homes, and they have to play suonas and kowtow!" On the morning of the 14th, Sanjimao hired musicians to play suonas, and he and his wife kowtowed as they walked, returning Lü Dengzhou's two bags of wheat. The surrounding area was a sea of people shouting slogans. When Sanjimao arrived at Lü Dengzhou's door, the suona players played particularly loudly. As he entered the door, he saw Lü Dengzhou wearing a straw hat, squinting, sitting at the door of the north room, fanning himself. Sanjimao kowtowed in the yard, but Lü Dengzhou pretended not to notice. Because Sanjimao's reverse liquidation almost drove him to death, he now wanted to give Sanjimao a punishment. Sanjimao kowtowed for an hour before Lü Dengzhou said, "What are you doing? My family hasn't died, and I dare not take your grain anymore." Seeing that Lü Dengzhou did not want it, everyone warned Sanjimao, saying, "He won't accept it because you wanted to kill him in the past. He doesn't dare to accept it today. If you don't make him accept it, we will kill you." Sanjimao kowtowed repeatedly, begging Lü Dengzhou to accept the grain. After Lü accepted the grain, Sanjimao kowtowed in the same way to the masses from whom he had reversed the grain in the past, returning grain and belongings. At present, the masses in more than 40 villages in the entire Fourth District are enthusiastically involved in the anti-reverse-liquidation struggle.

(From our correspondent in the Hebei-Shandong-Henan Border Region, 1st) After the recovery of Juancheng, thanks to the strong support of the leadership and the active lead of the cadres, a movement to reverse the grain and property was launched. According to statistics from all ten districts in the county, 120 villages have opened up the situation of anti-traitors, revenge, and anti-reverse-liquidation. The masses in the Third, Fourth, Fifth, and Sixth Districts are mostly involved in the struggle, and the masses in the First, Second, Seventh, Eighth, Ninth, and Tenth Districts have also begun to take action. Eight hundred farmers in the Eighth District jointly launched a grain-reversal struggle against landlords and special agents. Cadres in the Second District went deep among the masses and solved the problem of "the masses not daring to move." From the complaints of military, industrial, and martyr families, they learned that the masses needed grain, and the leadership firmly advocated distributing the landlords' grain to the masses. After the grain was distributed, the masses automatically destroyed the enemy's walls. Someone asked a participating woman, "Why are you here too?" She firmly said, "The Kuomintang army oppressed us, and we suffered so much. When the Eighth Route Army came, we had food to eat, why wouldn't we come and do it?" In short, the characteristic of this movement is that most of the women formed the main force of the struggle, and they replaced their sons and husbands who went to the front lines and to the river dikes. Women in Daxinzhuang, Tenth District, seized four bags of wheat and a large vat of clothes from the landlord's house. Women in Hanlou, Fifth District, arrested landlord women who oppressed them.

    鄄城农民扬眉吐气
    倒算地主磕头还粮
    【本报冀鲁豫一日电】鄄城四区反倒算运动猛烈开展，村村群众欢迎财粮回家，地主吹响器，磕头归还财粮。吕庙地主三鸡毛，因为在蒋军来时领导全村地主向农民倒地、倒粮、倒东西；解放后，群众纷纷要求物归原主，农民吕登州说：“他们倒粮时叫咱给他送家去，这也得叫他给咱送家来，还得吹着响器，叩着头才行。”十四号上午，三鸡毛雇了响器吹着，他和他老婆磕着头走着，归还吕登州的两布袋麦子，周围是人山号人海的群众在喊着口号。当三鸡毛到吕登州的门口时，喇叭吹的特别响了。一进门就看见吕登州戴着草帽，眯着眼，坐在北屋门口，扇着扇子。三鸡毛在院子里磕头，吕登州装不知道。因为三鸡毛倒粮时，几乎逼死他，他现在要给三鸡毛一个惩罚。三鸡毛磕头磕了一点钟，吕登州才说：“你这是干啥呀？我这一家子人也没死了，俺不敢再要你的粮食了。”大家见吕登州不要，就警告三鸡毛说：“他不收下就是因你过去要杀人家，人家今天不敢收，如果你不叫他收下，就杀你。”三鸡毛磕头如捣蒜，再三要求吕登州把粮食收下，吕收下粮食以后，三鸡毛同样地磕着头向他从前倒算过的群众送粮食还东西。目前全四区四十余村的群众正热烈的卷入反倒算斗争。
    【本报冀鲁豫一日电】鄄城收复后，由于领导上的大力撑腰，干部积极带头，掀起了倒粮倒财运动。综合全县十个区的统计，已有一百二十个村庄打开反奸、复仇、反倒算的局面，三、四、五、六四个区的群众大部卷入斗争，一、二、七、八、九、十等区的群众亦开始行动。八区八百农民联合向地主、特务展开倒粮斗争。二区干部深入群众，解决了“群众不敢动”的思想，从军、工、烈属大会的诉苦中了解了群众需要粮食，领导上坚决主张把地主的粮食分给群众。分粮后，群众自动破坏敌人围墙。有人问参加的妇女：“你为啥也来呢？”她坚决的说：“中央军压迫俺，俺受他多少气，八路军来了俺有饭吃，为啥不来干呢？”总之，这一运动特点是大部妇女形成了斗争的主力，她们代替了到前线到河堤上的儿子、丈夫。十区大辛庄的妇女从地主家里清查到四布袋麦子，一大缸衣服。五区韩楼妇女逮捕压迫她们的地主妇女。
