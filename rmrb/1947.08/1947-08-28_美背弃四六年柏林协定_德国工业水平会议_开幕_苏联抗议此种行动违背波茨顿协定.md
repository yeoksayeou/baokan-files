Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, August 23rd: London dispatch: The conference of the United Kingdom, the United States, and France on the issue of raising Germany's industrial level began here on the 22nd. The conference will also involve the management and control of the Ruhr coal mines. This conference is closely related to the Ruhr coal production conference and loan condition modification negotiations being conducted by the United Kingdom and the United States in Washington. The day before the conference opened, US Undersecretary of State Clayton also rushed to England to guide the conference. Clayton spent three weeks in Paris, holding several meetings with the US ambassadors to the United Kingdom and France, as well as officials from the US-occupied zone in Germany, to discuss the situation in the United Kingdom and France after the Ruhr plan was released. After arriving in London, Mr. Clayton immediately "discussed the situation" with British Lord President of the Council Morrison, Foreign Secretary Bevin, and President of the Board of Trade Cripps. US military governor for Germany Clay also flew to London with his advisor Murphy on the day the conference opened. The US delegation to the tripartite conference was headed by US Ambassador to the United Kingdom Douglas. The chief British representative was Permanent Under-Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs Jebb, and the French representative was Economic Advisor to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs Alphand.

Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, August 24th: Various sources: The British and American Foreign Offices simultaneously announced on the 21st that the Soviet government had submitted notes to the British and American governments on the 19th, protesting the tripartite British, American, and French conference on raising the industrial level of Germany, which opened in London on the 22nd. The notes stated that this unilateral and illegal conference by the United Kingdom, the United States, and France fundamentally violated the 1945 Potsdam Agreement regarding the German issue.

Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, August 23rd: Comprehensive report: The tripartite British, American, and French conference on Germany's industrial level that began on the 22nd is an illegal action by the United States to abandon the Four-Power Berlin Agreement of March 1946. As early as June of this year, British Deputy Military Governor of the British zone of Germany Robertson and US military governor for Germany Clay had drafted a plan to raise the industrial level of the British and American zones of Germany to 70% or 80% of pre-war levels, which stipulated that steel production should be increased from the 5.8 million tons annual output decided by the Four Powers to 12 to 14 million tons. The theme currently being discussed at the tripartite conference is this plan. The need to discuss this plan again is due to the intensification of contradictions between the United Kingdom and the United States, and between the United Kingdom, the United States, and France, after the US plan to control the Ruhr was simultaneously revealed. The United Kingdom originally agreed to raise Germany's industrial level in order to supplement its economy, but the United States' straightforward attempt to kick the United Kingdom out of the Ruhr caused the United Kingdom to waver. The "Robertson-Clay Plan" stipulated that Germany's steel industry level was equivalent to the United Kingdom's existing production volume (13 million tons), but it exceeded France's current steel production volume (4.5 million tons) by nearly three times. Even if all of France's existing steel production equipment were fully operational, it could only produce 12 million tons per year. In addition, France relied on foreign imports for one-third of the coal and coking coal it needed for pre-war production, and 60% of that depended on the Ruhr. Due to the destruction of the war, France's current recovery is particularly dependent on the supply of Ruhr coal. When France and the United Kingdom formed an alliance in February of this year, they hoped to continuously import Ruhr coal thereafter. Now that the United Kingdom and the United States plan to restore German industry and make it surpass France, not only has France's hope of obtaining Ruhr coal been completely shattered, leading to the risk of French industry being paralyzed due to the lack of coal and coking coal, but it has even suffered the threat of the resurgence of German military industry. However, the French Ramadier government, which maintains its anti-communist and anti-Soviet domestic and foreign policies with the support of the United States, like Daladier before the German invasion in 1940, has not attempted to effectively resist this plan that threatens France's survival. Only under pressure from public opinion did the French authorities make some protests to the United States. Finally, due to the intensification of contradictions between the United Kingdom and the United States, France gained the opportunity to attend the conference to state its opinions, but without decision-making power. Before the tripartite conference, the United States indicated that if France abandoned the independence of its occupied zone in Germany, the United States could grant France a third position on the Ruhr issue.

　　美背弃四六年柏林协定
  　“德国工业水平会议”开幕
    苏联抗议此种行动违背波茨顿协定
    【新华社陕北二十三日电】伦敦讯：英、美、法三国关于提高德国工业水平问题的会议，二十二日在此间开始。会议并将涉及鲁尔煤矿的管理与管制问题。这次会议与英美刻在华府进行的鲁尔煤产会议及修改贷款条件谈判，具有密切联系。会议召开前一天，美副国务卿克莱顿亦赶至英伦，指导会议的进行。克莱顿在巴黎留三周之久，与美驻英、法两国使节及德境美占领区官员数度集会，讨论鲁尔计划传出后英法的局势。克氏抵伦敦后，即与英枢密大臣摩里逊、外相贝文及商务大臣克利浦斯等“讨论局势”。德境美占领区司令克莱于会议开幕之日亦偕同其顾问莫菲飞抵伦敦。出席三国会议的美方代表，以驻英大使道格拉斯为首。英方首席为外交部常务次官詹金士，法国代表则是外交部经济顾问阿尔丰。
    【新华社陕北二十四日电】各方讯：英美外交部于二十一日同时宣布苏联政府曾于十九日向英美两国政府提出照会，抗议二十二日在伦敦召开的英美法三国关于提高国工业水平会议。照会称：英美法三国此种片面的非法的会议，根本违背一九四五年波茨顿协定关于德国问题的决定。
    【新华社陕北二十三日电】综合报导：二十二日开始的伦敦英美法三国关于德国工业水平会议，是美国背弃一九四六年三月四强柏林有关协定的非法行动。早在今年六月间，德境英占区副司令罗伯逊与美军司令克莱即已草就一项计划，拟将德国英美占区的工业水平提高到战前水平百分之七十或八十，其中规定钢生产量应由四强所决定的五百八十万吨年产量增至一千二百至一千四百万吨。刻下三国会议所讨论之主题，即为此项计划。该计划之需要再次讨论，乃由于该计划与美国控制鲁尔计划同时传出后，英美之间与英美及法国之间的矛盾顿趋激化的结果。英国同意提高德国工业水平，原图以此作为其经济的补充，但是美国自鲁尔踢开英国的率直企图，使英国发生了动摇。“罗、克计划”规定的德国钢业水平相等于英国现有的生产量（一千三百万吨），但是却超过法国目前钢产量（四百五十万吨）几近三倍。就法国现有的钢产设备，即使全部开动，亦仅可年产一千二百万吨。另外法国战前生产所需之煤与焦煤，三分之一要靠国外输入，而其中的百分之六十要仰赖于鲁尔。由于战争的破坏，法国目前的复兴，特别依赖鲁尔煤的供应。今年二月法国与英国缔盟时，即希望此后可源源输入鲁尔煤炭。现在英美计划恢复德国工业，并使之超过法国，不仅使法国取得鲁尔煤的希望全然破灭，以致法国工业有因煤与焦煤之缺乏而瘫痪不前之虞，甚至遭受德国军事工业再起的威胁。但是在美国支持下维持其反共仇苏内外政策之法国拉马第当局，一如一九四○年德国入侵前的达拉第，对这种威胁法国生存的计划，并未企图作有效的抵抗。只在舆论压力下，法国当局才对美国作了若干抗议的表示，最后由于英美矛盾之加剧，法国始争得了出席会议陈述意见的机会，但无决定权。三国会议召开前，美国曾作表示，如果法国放弃其德境法占领区的独立，则美国在鲁尔问题上可予法以第三个位置。
