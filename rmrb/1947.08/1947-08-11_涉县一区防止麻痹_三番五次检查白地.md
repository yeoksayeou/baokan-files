　　Shexian First District Prevents Complacency
  　Repeated Inspections of Bare Land
    [This newspaper, Shexian News] After the rain, all villages in the First District replanted, but the masses still had complacent thoughts, saying, "It's so late this year, even if we plant, we won't harvest much, we might as well wait until May next year," and others said, "I have so much bare land and unsprouted land, planting so many vegetables is too much." As a result, much bare land was left un-replanted, and the district leadership, upon discovering this, immediately issued an urgent notice to all villages, launching a general inspection. District and village cadres personally went to the fields, and the land bordering villages was also inspected mutually. Shentou Village found a total of 62 households with 41.1 mu of land un-replanted, including Wang Futian's good land of three mu, which was only plowed with a ridger without seeds being planted. After in-depth mobilization by the cadres, vegetables were planted, and his example was used to educate other masses, who then replanted the bare land. They also found 21 mu of bare land in other villages and immediately sent letters to those villages. The mobilization of vegetable planting in Sihe Village began with recalling the benefits of planting vegetables. Zhao Buzhi said, "In the past two years of famine, planting two and a half mu of vegetables, we thinned the vegetables four times, which was very helpful. The whole family of eight people survived the famine." This inspired everyone's enthusiasm for planting vegetables. Households without land to plant vegetables reclaimed 52.9 mu of wasteland on the mountain slope and sold the clods they dug up, which was enough to buy vegetable seeds. Comrade Zhang Wenyi of Huyuc personally went to the fields to inspect seven mu of bare land and also inspected eight mu in Shigang Village, immediately mobilizing them to plant vegetables. Nanzhuang Village initially found 95 mu of bare land, and then repeatedly inspected it. Inspecting bare land was like investigating feudalism, inspecting it five times. In addition to discussing and clearing the minds of some of the masses at the general meeting, cadres also went door-to-door to mobilize some of the masses who were determined to abandon the bare land. One military dependent woman had four mu of land with insufficient seedlings, and only planted one mu of vegetables. When mobilizing her, they first understood the situation and asked if her family had enough grain. She said that it would soon be gone, and they asked her how she planned to survive the famine next spring, and if it would be useful to harvest wheat if she couldn't get through the spring. This reminded her, and she immediately went to the cooperative to get vegetable seeds and planted them. Now, the entire district is organizing male and female laborers to carry out a crash campaign of weeding and fertilizing to increase production. (Chong Zhi, You Ao)

　　涉县一区防止麻痹
  　三番五次检查白地
    【本报涉县讯】一区各村雨后都进行了补种，但群众仍存有麻痹思想，都说：“今年这样迟了，种上收不成什么，干脆等明年五月吧，”还有的说：“我这么多白地和没苗地都种上菜太多了，”因此留下很多白地没苗不补，区领导上发现后，马上紧急通知各村，发动普遍检查，区村干部亲自到地里去，村与村交界的地也都互相检查。神头村共检查出六十二户四十一亩一分地未补种，内有王福田好地三亩光用耧划了沟未下上籽，经干部深入动员，已种上了菜，拿他的事实教育了其他群众，都补种了白地，并查出别村白地二十一亩，马上给该村去了信。四合乡村发动种菜是先回忆种菜好处，赵补治说：“前二年灾荒种菜二亩半，光间菜就间了四次，顶了很大用，全家八口人渡过了灾荒。”这样启发了大家的种菜积极性，没地种菜的户，到大脑上开荒种菜五十二亩九分，弄下的圪塔，卖了足够买菜籽用。胡峪张文义同志亲自到地查看白地七亩，又到石岗村查出八亩，马上动员种上了菜。南庄村第一次查出九十五亩白地，后来又反复检查，查白地就和查封建一样，查了五遍，除大会讨论打通了一部分群众思想外，还有一部分决心丢白地的群众，干部又挨门挨户的进行了动员，有一个军属老婆，家有四亩不够苗地，只种了一亩菜。动员他时首先了解了情况，又问他家粮食多不多，她说马上就快没吃了，又问她明年春天准备怎样渡荒，春天过不去收了麦子有用没有，这样提醒了她，马上去合作社支下菜籽，下了种。现在全区正组织男女劳力突击锄苗、上肥增加产量。（崇智、有鳌）
