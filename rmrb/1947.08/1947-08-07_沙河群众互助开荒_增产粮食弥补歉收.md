    Shahe Masses Help Each Other Reclaim Wasteland
    Increase Grain Production to Make Up for Poor Harvests
    [This Newspaper] News: In light of this year's irregular rainfall and the certainty of reduced autumn harvests, the masses in many villages in Shahe, after completing the post-rain rush planting, are taking advantage of the slack time to organize themselves to plow wasteland, plant buckwheat, and sow autumn vegetables, actively increasing grain production to prepare for famine. At the New City cadre meeting on the 28th of last month, it was discussed that even if the rainfall is smooth from now on, the harvest will at most be 40% of a normal year. There still won't be enough grain to eat. To increase grain production, while the seedlings are not all up yet, the work is not tight, and the livestock are available, the organization should plant buckwheat in the wasteland. The district cadres announced on the spot: Plowing wasteland to plant buckwheat will not incur any burden or rent. The group leaders were very enthusiastic, saying that planting buckwheat doesn't take much work, just plow and sow it. All the buckwheat harvested will be their own. After the meeting, they went back to mobilize. The next day, the village office loaned out seven large cloth bags of buckwheat seeds. Liu Ruzhang's mutual aid group dispatched two teams of livestock, Liu Qizong's group dispatched three teams of livestock, each team with a full laborer to hold the plow and a half laborer to pull the livestock (mutual aid plowing and planting of buckwheat, with grain distributed in the autumn according to the amount of labor contributed), and the remaining groups also dispatched livestock, with the remaining laborers striving to ensure the first crop's success. "No wasteland left uncultivated after hoeing," seize the time to hoe the small seedlings.
    
    Because there was a lot of alkaline land in Xidu Village where seedlings weren't planted, after the rain, the cadres called on the masses to plow wasteland to plant buckwheat and vegetables, saying that even if there are turnips to eat, people won't starve to death. The village cadres personally took the lead, with the public security officer plowing eight acres of wasteland first, the Farmers' Association Director Li Mingxiang plowing twenty-two acres, and the secretary plowing nine acres. In five days, the whole village plowed more than 230 acres of wasteland, all planted with buckwheat and vegetables.
    
    After the thorough rain, the masses in Ximao Village, under the active leadership of cadres and group leaders, completed the rush planting of 3,800 acres in two and a half days. On the evening of the 29th of last month, another meeting of group leaders was held. After concrete calculations, a plan was made to eliminate wasteland and increase grain production. At the meeting, Yang Yukui and Yang Xinsheng said: There are benefits to planting wasteland this year. First, there is no burden, and you get as much as you harvest. Second, there is no need to worry about seeds, as the cooperative has already bought 2,100 catties. Third, buckwheat goes well with small vegetables, so you harvest buckwheat and vegetables. Fourth, if the land is plowed, it can't be left fallow, and early planting next year can increase spring crops. Finally, it was decided to distribute according to labor, whoever works the land gets the grain. Each group made a wasteland reclamation plan. One group plans to reclaim twenty acres, and the cadres and group leaders are now separately looking for wasteland to break through.
    
    In Zhongguan Village, all twelve mutual aid groups unanimously wanted to plant millet after the rain. Seeds were exchanged by each group. Two-thirds of the village can plant millet, and one-third can plant miscellaneous grains. Buckwheat and vegetables are planted on the upland. One thousand acres were completed on the 30th. The millet was planted in the morning, and soybeans were planted and rolled in the afternoon. Buckwheat was plowed and sown on the 31st.
    
    After the rain, Rong, the district chief of Qingjie Village, called for plowing wasteland and planting more vegetables to prepare for famine in order to harvest more grain. Under the leadership of cadres, 300 acres of wasteland were reclaimed and planted with vegetables in three days. At the same time, in order to prevent the masses from forgetting the famine due to the rain, in conjunction with planting vegetables, they recalled the disasters of '42 and '43. Twenty people, including women and old people, reflected on the suffering they endured during the famine years, shedding tears non-stop, which opened up everyone's thinking, and they want to continue to prepare for famine.
    
    In Liu Village, under the leadership of cadres and militiamen, the whole village, men, women, old and young, worked together to reclaim wasteland and plant buckwheat, vegetables, hemp beans, and alfalfa. The third group led by the village chief reclaimed 120 acres in three days. The public security officer Zhao Xinbao led his group to reclaim 160 acres in three days. The militia reclaimed twenty acres in one day and immediately planted sesame seeds and buckwheat. The whole village reclaimed more than 700 acres in five days.
    
    It was raining in Xinzhai, and the group leaders discussed that they would guarantee to eliminate 150 acres of wasteland in three days. After the rain, it was completed in only two days. (Shahe Organized News Bulletin)

    沙河群众互助开荒
    增产粮食弥补歉收
    【本报讯】沙河不少村群众鉴于今年雨水失调，秋收减成已定，于完成雨后抢种后，趁活不紧，纷纷组织起来犁荒地，种荞麦，撒秋菜，积极增产粮食备荒。新城于上月二十八日干部会上即讨论今年虽然下了种，就是今后雨水调顺，最多不过四成年景，粮食还是不够吃，要增产粮食，趁小苗还没全上来，活还不紧，牲口有空，组织在荒地种荞麦。区干部当场宣布：犁荒地种荞麦，不负担不出租子，组长们劲头很大，都说种荞麦不费多大工，只要犁好种上就行，打下荞麦都是自己的。会后回去动员，第二天村公所贷出荞麦种七大布袋，刘如章互助组出动两犋牲口，刘其宗组出动三犋牲口，每犋牲口一个整劳力捉犁，一个半劳力拉牲口（互助犁地种荞麦，秋后按出劳力多少分粮食），其余各组亦出动了牲口，下余劳力争取头遍苗定年成。“过锄没荒地”，抓紧锄小苗。
    西杜村因碱地很多没按上苗，雨后干部号召群众犁荒地种荞麦种菜，有蔓菁吃也饿不死，村干部亲自动手起带头作用，公安员首先犁荒八亩，农会主任李明详犁了二十二亩，书记犁九亩，经五天全村共犁了荒地二百三十余亩，都种上荞麦和菜。
    西毛村透雨后，群众在干部各组长积极领导下，两天半完成抢种三千八百亩。上月二十九日晚上，又召开组长会，经过具体算帐，订出消灭荒地增产粮食计划。会上杨玉魁、杨心生说：今年种荒地有好处，一、不负担，打多少自己得多少；二、不用发愁种籽，合作社已给买来二千一百斤；三、荞麦不好带上小菜，收荞麦又收菜；四、犁了地就不能荒，明年早种又能增加春苗。最后讨论出按劳力分红，谁下地谁分粮，各组订了开荒计划，有一组计划开荒二十亩，现各干部组长分头找荒地突围中。
    中关全村十二个互助组，下雨后一致要种小谷子，种籽由各组调换，全村能种小谷子三分之二，杂粮三分之一，岗地种荞麦和菜，三十日完成一千亩，午前种完午后点豆砘地，三十一日犁种荞麦。
    青介村雨后经荣区长号召，为了多打粮食备荒，下透了雨要犁荒地多种菜，在干部领导下三天开荒种菜三百亩。同时为让群众不因下雨而忘记灾荒，结合种菜回想四二、四三年灾荒，妇女老白的等廿人反省了灾荒年受的痛苦，都掉泪不止，打通了大家思想，要继续备荒。
    留村在干部民兵带头下，全村男女老少齐动手，开荒种荞麦、菜、麻豆、苜蓿，村长带领的第三组，三十户三天开荒一百二十亩。公安员赵新保带领他组三天开荒一百六十亩。民兵一天开荒二十亩，当天就构上芝麻、荞麦，全村五天内共开荒七百多亩。
    辛寨天正下雨，各组长就讨论这次下透咱保证三天能消灭荒地一百五十亩，雨后，只两天就完成了。（沙河组织起来小报）
