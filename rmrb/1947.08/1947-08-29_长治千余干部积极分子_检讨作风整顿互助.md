　　Changzhi Over a Thousand Cadre Activists
  　Examine Their Work Style and Rectify Mutual Aid
    [Reported by this newspaper] Changzhi's first, second, and fifth districts successively convened a meeting of 1,112 cadre activists on the 8th and 9th of this month, discussing how to summarize the production and rectification of the mutual aid movement. It was discovered that there were many problems in terms of thought and practice: (1) Engaging in mutual aid was for the sake of currying favor with superiors and obtaining the "Excellent Banner"; (2) Engaging in mutual aid was to respond to the government's call, repaying the Communist Party's kindness for enabling them to stand up; (3) Participating in mutual aid was out of fear of struggle, fear of being labeled as selfish; (4) Participating in mutual aid was in the hope of finding opportunities to gain small advantages; (5) Basically, they were not interested in mutual aid, feeling that struggle was more profitable. Due to the existence of the above-mentioned thoughts, there were many unfair and unreasonable phenomena in practice and attitude. For example, Shi Fuzhi from Cui Zhang Village said: "I am unwilling to participate in mutual aid. Others do work for me and I don't want to pay wages, thinking that all farmers are one family and it won't be too late to settle after the autumn harvest. As a result, people don't want to work for me." The village head of Bitou Village said: "I always feel that mutual aid is troublesome; I am more interested in holding struggle meetings because they can deliver results." The village head of Erxinyi Village said: "My leadership of mutual aid is done through meetings. The leadership is not in-depth. We hold meetings during the day and meetings at night, making no progress. We just keep holding meetings, causing everyone to go to bed late and not be able to get up early." The political director of Gaohe said: "The higher-ups called on us to do it, and I had no choice, but I was also afraid of falling behind. Therefore, whoever didn't participate in the mutual aid group was driven out of the village, scaring them into participating. As a result, it collapsed in a few days." Lao Chou from Shi Houpo in the fifth district said: "In order to respond to the call from above, we used the 'rolling mat' method to organize mutual aid groups. We would just include the land without calculating work points, resulting in unclear accounts and being unable to find the households that should provide rice. There was no other way, so I said at a mass meeting: 'This is terrible! The old feudalism is defeated, and a new feudalism has emerged! Whoever should provide rice and doesn't will be struggled against.' Some people were afraid of struggle and took out some rice to end the matter hastily.” At the same time, they discussed the method of combining agriculture and sideline occupations, calculating work points and distributing dividends of the mutual aid group of Cao Linshui, a hero who turned over in Nantianhe, Third District; the method of family dividend distribution of labor hero Bi Eryun; and the calculation of work points of Shi Panghai in the First District and Chen Dongzhi in the Fifth District. They unanimously agreed that they were fair and reasonable and should be learned from and commended. They also recognized the benefits of mutual aid and mutual benefit.

　　长治千余干部积极分子
  　检讨作风整顿互助
    【本报讯】长治一、二、五区先后于八、九两天召开了一千一百一十二人的干部积极分子会议，讨论如何总结生产与整顿互助运动。发现在思想上作法上有很多毛病：（一）搞互助是为了在上级面前讨好，优胜旗；（二）搞互助是为响应政府号召，党领导翻了身，报共产党的恩；（三）参加互助是怕斗争，怕说是自私自利；（四）参加互助有机可投，讨点便宜；（五）根本对互助不感兴趣，不如斗争有利可图。由于以上几种思想存在，所以作法与态度上是有许多不公道不合理的现象，如崔漳村史福只说：“我参加互助我可不愿干，别人给我作了工不想出工资，以为天下农民是一家，秋后给他不算迟，结果人家不给我干啦。”壁头村长说：“我总感互助麻烦，开斗争会好有兴趣，能兑现。”二信义村长说：“我领导互助是会议方式，领导不深入，白天开会黑夜开会，搞不起来，一直开会，开的大家晚上睡的迟，清早起不来。”高河政治主任说：“上级号召我无办法，又怕落后，所以谁不参加互助组赶出村去，吓唬他们参加，结果不几天即垮台了。”五区石后坡老臭说：“我们为了响应上级号召，用卷席办法组织互助组，见地就进也不计工，结果帐亦不清，找不出出米户来，无办法，我在群众会上说：‘这还了得，旧封建打垮新封建又出来了，谁该出米不出斗争谁。有些怕斗争，拿出些米来，马马虎虎结束了。”同时又讨论了三区南天河翻身英雄曹林水互助组的农副业结合计工折工分红办法，劳动英雄毕二云的家庭分红办法，及一区史胖孩、五区陈冬至的计工折工，一致认为公道又合理，要学习表扬，并认识了互助互利。（整顿互助小报）
