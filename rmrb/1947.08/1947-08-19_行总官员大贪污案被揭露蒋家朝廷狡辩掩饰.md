Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 17th: According to a report from the Associated Press in Shanghai on the 15th, Chinese newspapers have recently revealed a major corruption scandal involving Executive Yuan officials embezzling relief supplies. The corrupt individuals include Li Zhuomin, Deputy Director of the Executive Yuan Relief and Rehabilitation Administration (CNRRA), and the heads of its five departments: Finance, Public Sales, Storage and Transportation, General Affairs, and Fisheries. Huang Liang (transliteration), the Chief Prosecutor of the Shanghai Chiang Kai-shek Local Court Procuratorate, has received five anonymous accusations against them for corruption. These include: (1) Of the 30,000 electric fans transferred from UNRRA to CNRRA, 10,000 have been embezzled; (2) CNRRA exchanged 6 million pounds of cotton for 4 million pounds of cotton yarn, and 90 pounds of cotton were embezzled in each exchange; (3) Five pounds of flour were embezzled for every 100 pounds of wheat milled; (4) The transportation of some relief supplies was handled by the Merchant Marine Committee, with shipping costs as high as 30 percent, resulting in significant extortion during this process; (5) Li Zhuomin currently resides in Wang Jingwei's former residence, employs 18 servants, and privately uses two refrigerators purchased by CNRRA, while another military officer owns three cars. After the exposure of this corruption, the Kuomintang authorities were very flustered and tried every means to cover up for Li and others. The Director of CNRRA issued a statement on the 15th, stubbornly claiming that the news was "absurd." The investigators sent by the Kuomintang Control Yuan specifically for this matter also attempted to exonerate Li and others, saying there was "no crime of luxurious living." In fact, CNRRA's corruption did not begin today. As early as July 15th of last year, the Tianjin Ta Kung Pao revealed in its editorial the fact that "relief supplies first ‘relieve’ the Executive Yuan's Relief Administration." The "Changsha Flour Incident" in December of last year (the CNRRA branch bribed the Changsha press with 1,520 tons of relief flour to prevent the press from exposing its corruption) is even more widely known. Since its establishment in January 1945, CNRRA has become a piece of fat that the four major families have been vying for (Xinmin Daily). Initially, Jiang Tingfu, with the support of Kong Xiangxi, became the Director of CNRRA. Last September, Jiang was finally squeezed out by Song Ziwen, and Huo Baoshu, a newly promoted cadre in the Song-affiliated consortium, succeeded him. The "corruption" of CNRRA is, in fact, the four major families turning relief supplies into private property for their family coffers. Therefore, when CNRRA's corruption was exposed, Chiang Kai-shek's regime was thrown into a panic.

　　行总官员大贪污案被揭露蒋家朝廷狡辩掩饰
    【新华社陕北十七日电】据合众社上海十五日电称：中国报纸最近披露了国民党行总私吞救济物资的大贪污消息。贪污者为行总副署长李卓敏及其财务、公卖、储运、总务、渔业等五所所长。上海蒋记地方法院检查处首席检查官黄良（译音）已接获匿名者对彼等贪污之五项控告。即：（一）联总移交予行总之三万架电扇中，一万架已被吞没；（二）行总以六百万磅棉花换得棉纱四百万磅，每次交换中。贪污棉花九十磅；（三）每磨麦一百磅贪污面粉五磅；（四）部分救济物品之运送系交商船委员会处理，副船商水脚达百分之三十，在此种手续中大事敲榨；（五）李卓敏现住汪精卫之前寓所有，仆人十八名，并私用行总所购之冷藏器二个，另一行军官员一人拥有汽车三辆。此项贪污揭露后，国民党官方甚为慌张，百方为李等掩饰，行总署长于十五日发表谈话硬称此消息为“无稽”，国民党监察院专为此事派出之调查员，亦企图为李等洗脱，说“无住所奢侈之罪。”按行总贪污并非始至今日，去年七月十五日天津大公报即曾在其社论中揭露过“救济物资先‘救济’行政院的救济总署”的事实。去年十二月的“长沙面粉事件”，（行总分署以一千五百二十吨救济面粉贿赂长沙报界以避免其贪污事实被报界揭露），更为众所周知，行总自四五年一月成立以来，即成为四大家族争着夺取的一块肥肉，（新民报语），开始是蒋廷铠在孔祥熙的支持下，作了行总署长，去年九月蒋终于为宋子文挤掉；由宋系财团里新进干员霍宝树继任，行总的“贪污”，事实上就是四大家族将救济物资化作其家族财库的私产，因此当行总贪污被揭露时，蒋家朝廷为之手足慌乱。
