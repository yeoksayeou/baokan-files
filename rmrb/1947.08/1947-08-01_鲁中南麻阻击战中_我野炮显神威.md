Xinhua News Agency, East China Front, 30th: In the victorious Luzhong Nanma blocking battle, the People's Liberation Army's field artillery displayed great power. On the morning of the 19th, Chiang Kai-shek's reorganized 11th Division stubbornly resisted on the No. 150 Highland in Rulin (ten miles northeast of Nanma), relying on solid fortifications. The PLA field artillery regiment, following orders, braved the rainstorm and rushed to the front line. With the force of thunder, it fiercely attacked the highland. The loud noise shook the valley, and every shell hit its target. Within fifteen minutes, all the bunkers and fortifications on the highland were completely destroyed. Chiang's troops left piles of corpses and fled in panic. The PLA infantry then quickly pursued, and in the thick smoke, captured the highland. When Chiang's troops bombarded the PLA infantry positions with howitzers, the PLA field artillery immediately launched a fierce counterattack. After firing more than fifty shells in succession, Chiang's howitzers fell silent. At this time, a call came from the front-line command post: "They are hitting perfectly! A part of the enemy's howitzers and vehicles have perished together. Several places in the enemy's station of Wujiaguanzhuang (on the east side of Nanma) have caught fire."
    Xinhua News Agency, East China Front, 30th: A U.S.-made Chiang Kai-shek bomber flew to the area east of Laiwu on the 24th to wreak havoc. It was shot down by the PLA and crashed and burned in Songxianling, twenty miles north of Lucun.

    鲁中南麻阻击战中
    我野炮显神威
    【新华社华东前线卅日电】鲁中南麻胜利阻击战中，解放军野炮大显神威。十九日上午，蒋军整编第十一师在儒林的（在南麻东北十里）一五零高地凭藉坚固工专顽抗，解放军野炮兵团奉命冒暴风雨驰抵前线，以雷霆万钧之势，向高地猛击，巨响震撼山谷，弹弹命中目标，于十五分钟内，将该高地所有碉堡工事全部摧毁，蒋军遗尸累累，残部仓惶逃窜。解放军步兵乃急起直追，在浓烟弥漫中，攻占该高地。当蒋军以榴弹炮轰击解放军步兵阵地时，解放军野炮即予以猛烈还击，连发五十多发后，蒋军榴弹炮便哑然无声。此时前线指挥所传来电话，“打得正好，敌人一部分榴弹炮和汽车，已同归于尽，敌人驻地吴家官庄（在南麻东侧）好几处已起火。”
    【新华社华东前线三十日电】美造蒋轰炸机一架于二十四日飞至莱芜以东地区肆虐，当为解放军击落，于鲁村北二十之里松仙岭坠地焚毁。
