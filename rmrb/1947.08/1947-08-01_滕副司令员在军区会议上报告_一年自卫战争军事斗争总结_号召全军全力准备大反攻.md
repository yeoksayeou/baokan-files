    Deputy Commander Teng Reports on the Military Struggle Summary of One Year of Self-Defense War
    Calling on the Entire Army to Fully Prepare for the Great Counter-Offensive
    [Special Dispatch from This Newspaper] At this Jinji-Luyu Military Region meeting, Deputy Commander Teng made a basic summary of the military struggle experience of the patriotic self-defense war in this region over the past year and put forward the basic tasks for the entire army to fully prepare for the great counter-offensive. In his summary report, he first estimated the achievements of the patriotic self-defense war over the past year. He said that in the past year, under the leadership of the Party Central Committee, the Party, government, army, and people of the entire region have worked together with one heart and one mind, resolutely struggled, and completed three major historical transformations: from peace to self-defense war, from guerrilla warfare to large-scale regular warfare, and from rent reduction and interest reduction, anti-traitor and liquidation to large-scale land reform. As a result, we have achieved brilliant results and won victory. The field army and local army (excluding militia) of the entire region annihilated more than 300,000 enemies, and controlled more than 120 county towns. There are still more than 80 counties that are border areas or behind enemy lines, but guerrilla warfare has been widely launched and government orders are unimpeded. The population of the entire region has recovered to the number before the war. Our region has shifted from a situation of enemy advance and our retreat, mutual sawing to a counter-offensive. In terms of the operational characteristics of each military region, Deputy Commander Teng said that, comparing the battle results of the military region field armies, the battle results of the Taiyue Military Region field army were greater. In the merit-making plan for April, May, and June, Taiyue proposed the largest number (10,000 to 11,000 people). In April and May, it had already exceeded the three-month plan, annihilating 13,000 enemies. A certain corps in Yuwansu had great battle results, having captured 16 county towns in half a year. Over the past year, the entire army and people in the region have persisted in the struggle behind enemy lines, crushed six or seven large-scale mopping-up operations by the enemy, and expanded the liberated area by one time. Among the divisional troops, the Taihang Fifth Military Sub-district troops also had good battle results, completing and exceeding the merit-making plan by three times in January, February, and March of this year. The Jiluyu has many new creations in guerrilla warfare, especially controlling rural positions, taking up guns in one hand and distributing fields in the other, implementing land reform in the midst of cruel struggles, and persisting in the struggle in the vast areas behind enemy lines on the south bank of the Yellow River. In this year, no matter which military region, the combat effectiveness has been improving day by day. Local corps can not only eliminate an enemy regular army company or battalion, but also completely eliminate a regular regiment. In one year, more than 40 county towns were recovered. Of the more than 300,000 enemies eliminated in one year, local corps eliminated 110,000. A large number of local corps have been upgraded to field armies, and now the number of field armies has reached two-thirds of the total armed forces in the region, which is a great victory.
    In terms of troop replenishment and people's participation in the war, Deputy Commander Teng said that in the past year, because our people's army defended the land for the people, it has been enthusiastically supported by the broad masses of the people. Before and after, more than 200,000 liberated peasants have automatically joined the People's Liberation Army. In every battle, thousands upon thousands of people automatically participated in the war, carrying the wounded, transporting ammunition, grinding rice and flour, and boiling soup and water. Both the front and the rear were working hard to serve the war, forming a magnificent scene of people's war. However, in the early stages of the war, the ratio of civilian participation to the army was still too large. In the Yubei campaign this year, one soldier and one civilian were achieved, saving a lot of civilian manpower.
    Regarding the basic experience in the military struggle of the patriotic self-defense war, Deputy Commander Teng briefly put forward eight points:
    First, we must resolutely overcome peaceful illusions. This is mainly manifested in the insufficient estimate of Chiang Kai-shek, this traitor, and believing in his peace deception. We must recognize that Chiang Kai-shek is a public enemy of the people, a stumbling block to the liberation of the Chinese people, and the biggest obstacle to achieving China's independence and liberation. We must strictly rectify discipline and wage a merciless struggle against all decadent ideas and right-leaning retreat phenomena. We must strengthen the confidence of the army and the people in victory, promote heroic struggle and unwillingness to sacrifice, and use all our strength to wage a resolute struggle against the enemy. We must emphasize obeying organizational leadership, uniting as one, and being consistent against the enemy in order to change the situation of the struggle. At the beginning of the self-defense war, some cadres betrayed the masses, retreated and fled, and some retreated to the right, but because we promptly rectified discipline, rectified the rear, resolutely dismissed incompetent personnel, boldly promoted a group of new activists who fought tenaciously and combined with the people, and persisted in the struggle in the occupied areas, this enabled the war situation in our region to complete a decisive transformation in a very short period of time. Experience proves that the combat effectiveness of troops that have strong leadership and education in ideology, can often fight against all decadent ideas, quickly put down their burdens, and achieve ideological unity is also the fastest. Experience has also proven that war is a severe test, and both individuals and troops undergo great changes in war. Only those who can maintain continuous ideological leadership and progress can adapt to the changes in the new situation, otherwise, they will fall behind and even be eliminated by the new situation.
    Second, we must resolutely implement Chairman Mao's operational guiding principle of concentrating superior forces to annihilate the enemy's living forces, not only in campaigns but also in tactics. Experience proves that those who can concentrate forces to implement broad maneuvers, not care about the gains and losses of one city or one place, not butt heads with the enemy like cattle, but actively find and create the enemy's weaknesses, and use five, six, or even ten times more troops than the enemy to annihilate an enemy regiment or battalion, not fight a costly battle without certainty, but fight a war of annihilation with certainty, will win every battle, and the combat effectiveness of the troops will also be rapidly improved, forcing the enemy to carry out defense, disperse their forces, and fall into passivity. We must use wisdom to fight, learn two sets of skills, give orders to our own troops, and also learn to give orders to the enemy, mobilizing the enemy to make the enemy obey our orders. If a battle that is not successful or a costly battle is fought, the guide of the battle should be checked first, and then the executor of the battle.
    Third, mobile warfare is the main form of war in today's self-defense war, but it must be supplemented by guerrilla warfare to establish a rear enemy line. To this end, we must persist in the struggle in the occupied areas, let go of mobilizing the mass guerrilla warfare in the occupied areas, share life and death with the people, stand up for the people, implement the policy of taking up guns in one hand and distributing fields in the other, the enemy advances and we advance, the enemy stays and we advance. Experience proves that as long as we are determined to persist, we can persist in the struggle in any region, and persistence can lead to victory. As long as we fight for the masses, there will be mass participation in the war. As long as we let go of mobilizing the masses to stand up for the peasant armed forces and vigorously control the landlords, the masses will become tough and enthusiastically distribute fields and food, and the landlords will become soft. We can control the vast positions in the countryside. On the contrary, all views that land reform cannot be implemented in guerrilla warfare must be corrected. As long as we grasp the armed fists, actively attack the enemy, combine the persistence of the hinterland with the maneuver of the outer line and the flexibility of concentration and dispersion, and widely carry out land struggles (tunnel warfare and landmine warfare) and joint defense struggles, we can smash any mopping-up operation by the enemy. As long as we have clear and firm policies, resolutely suppress the reactionary and tyrannical landlords, treat the accomplices and wavering landlords with leniency, and reward the landlords who are neutral and cover our work, the landlord class will inevitably be divided, and we can gain absolute rural superiority to minimize the enemy's social foundation to the smallest extent. However, some areas are not vigilant enough against the landlords' masks, so it is wrong to hold peace meetings with the landlords.
    Fourth, we must build the army in combat and implement construction while fighting. We must actively fight, cultivate and improve the combat effectiveness of the field army and the local army from combat exercises, and timely and continuously upgrade the local corps to the field army, so that the number of field armies reaches two-thirds of the total troops to meet the needs of the great counter-offensive.
    Fifth, we must universally implement the mass line, restore the spirit of the Gutian Conference, and implement it in combat exercises and other work to widely improve the enthusiasm and creativity of cadres and combatants. We must recognize that the opinions of the majority of the masses concentrated together are the Party's policy. It is not to use the Party's policy and the opinions of the leaders to modify the demands of the masses, but to modify the Party's policy and the opinions of the leaders according to the opinions and demands of the masses. This is the general spirit of the mass line. According to one year of experience, the development of the mass line has the following contents:
    A. The leadership must be combined with the masses. First, leading cadres are required to humbly learn, bravely accept the opinions and experiences of others and the lower levels, and dare to self-criticize. Secondly, the cadres' example of sharing weal and woe and caring for the lower levels is of great importance to inspiring the morale of the soldiers, the unity of cadres and masses, and the development of mass movements. Thirdly, let go of developing democracy. Except for combat orders, the leadership should consciously organize the masses to conduct democratic discussions on all issues, express opinions, put forward suggestions, and promote the form of the "Zhuge Liang Meeting." In particular, it is necessary to implement economic openness and let the masses manage themselves. The leading organs should go deep into the lower levels, listen to and collect the experiences and opinions of the masses, summarize and improve them, and then persist in the masses, educate and improve the troops, and create a style.
    B. Mutual assistance, mutual learning, and grievance-telling movement. The mutual assistance group is a very good form, which has greatly promoted the consolidation of the army in combat exercises and mass work. It enables new and old fighters and liberated fighters to learn from each other's strengths and help each other (that is, the so-called three-in-one education and remembering and learning well movement), especially the universal development of the mass grievance-telling movement is even more important. This is a mass ideological movement to improve the class consciousness and class awareness of the troops. The combat effectiveness of the troops where the grievance-telling movement is carried out well has been improved very quickly. The Chen Geng Corps had very good urban discipline, mainly because it promoted it through the mass movement of learning well and remembering well.
    C. More rewards and less criticism, widely carry out the heroic model movement, and promote activists. Creating a new heroism climax through the heroic model movement. This is an important step to improve the enthusiasm of the masses.
    D. From the development of the heroic model movement, we will further universally develop the merit-making movement for the people, advocating everyone to make merit and merit-making competitions. In particular, it is most important for leading cadres to first formulate plans, set an example, and make merit achievements. In addition, it should also be promoted through forms such as reporting merits and congratulating merits to further connect the local and the army, combining the local Party and government and the masses to promote the political work of the army. This has become a new development in political work.
    E. Create and cultivate typical accumulations of experience to popularize the whole army. Those who can truly carry out the above-mentioned contents and continue to develop and progress, their troops will show vitality, rapid progress, good discipline, rapid improvement in combat effectiveness, and the ideological problems of cadres will also be greatly reduced. Cadres also feel that their work is competent and happy, and their active creativity is unprecedentedly improved, and all work is easy to promote and implement.
    Sixth, we must correctly implement financial and economic policies and solve the problem of war supplies. On the one hand, we should fully guarantee the supply of military needs to the front line, mobilize all manpower and material resources to support the front line, and strive to improve military industrial production to ensure a continuous supply of team members and cadres to the front line, and oppose the revival of everything. On the other hand, we should strive for economy, avoid extravagance and waste, carry out scientific calculations and organization, cherish the people's manpower and material resources, tighten the rear, reduce the living standards of the rear organs and troops, and adapt to the conditions of long-term war and people's burden. We must obey unified leadership, abide by laws and regulations, and oppose starting from local and positional interests. In terms of logistics organization, experience has proven that the logistics command headquarters and the accompanying offices at all levels, which are unified organizations of the Party, government, army, and people, are the best form of war service organization. It has a strong mobilization force and organizational force. It can unify and regulate forces and scientifically calculate forces. It has played a great role in the self-defense war.
    Seventh, we must strengthen military exercises and improve the tactical and political level of the troops in combat. In the past few months, mass-line military exercises have been universally carried out, and its main contents are:
    A. Military exercises in combat gaps, seizing all available time for training, even training while fighting, resting during the day and training at night, training one day counts as one day, and training one month counts as one month.
    B. Combining combat and training, learning what is needed, striving to adapt to the actual combat, and combining combat and training repeatedly, training is for combat, and combat improves training. Oppose formality and mechanical uniformity. Each troop should carry out mass tactical inspections from the bottom up, assess casualties (this is a very important educational method and must be universally promoted. General experience shows that half of the casualties can be avoided), summarize experience and accept the good experience of other troops to formulate and attack the training subjects they need, and quickly apply these experiences to training. Advocate universally conducting combat drills immediately before combat.
    C. Mutual assistance and learning, implementing officer teaching soldiers, soldiers teaching soldiers, soldiers teaching officers, and three-in-one education.
    D. Cadre training: Middle and lower-level cadres are transferred in turn to training teams and military and political universities for study, focusing on sorting out experience and conducting exercises. This is a good way to preserve cadres, reduce unnecessary casualties of cadres, and improve the command ability and tactical and technical level of cadres. Senior cadres focus on organizing self-study. At the brigade, column, and military region levels and above, necessary cadre meetings should be convened more often to summarize experience, discuss current affairs policies, and ideological issues. Sometimes senior leading organs can hold short-term (ten days and a half months) study meetings for senior cadres. Ideological leadership for senior cadres should be a very important task of the army's Party. In addition, in order to solve the shortage of cadres in the troops, transferring and selecting local cadres to join the army, adding short-term training to serve in the troops has become our very good experience and system.
    E. New fighters and liberated fighters must be added to the troops after short-term training. Universally organize replenishment regiments, at least one per column, with a training time of at least one month. First, focus on political education, conduct grievance-telling and gratitude-reporting movements, and conduct military training on this basis. Experience has proven that new fighters and liberated fighters who have undergone training can reduce casualties by at least half or more. At the same time, the replenishment regiment can also ensure that the troops obtain continuous replenishment. This is an indispensable organization in continuous combat.
    F. Military and political education must be closely combined, and political work must guarantee the completion of combat exercise tasks.
    Eighth, we must strengthen centralized leadership and improve the Party committees at all levels. We must improve the Party committee organizations of the field army columns, brigades, and regiments. This is a newly established organization. Political commissars at all levels must learn to do the work of Party committee secretaries to replace the previous work methods. Only in this way can we unify the struggles of the front line, the enemy's rear line, and the rear, unify the three major tasks of the army itself: combat, mass work, and financial production, and enable the cadres in the leadership group to achieve consistency in understanding and action through democratic discussions in the Party committee, so as to facilitate promoting the implementation of the lower levels and give full play to the enthusiasm of the whole Party, concentrate the use of forces to achieve victory.
    Finally, Deputy Commander Teng called on the entire army to fully prepare for the great counter-offensive and resolutely complete the three major tasks. First of all, we must continue to eliminate a large number of Chiang's troops around our region. To this end, it is required to strengthen the construction of new field armies, improve the combat effectiveness of field armies, strengthen combat exercises and military and political training, study Chairman Mao's military thought, learn the roundabout warfare and positional warfare, strengthen the construction of engineering artillery, concentrate on mobile attacks on the enemy, and all enemies that can be eliminated and places that can be recovered must be eliminated and recovered; it is required to strengthen the construction of military regions, clarify the tasks of military region work, continue to independently and autonomously develop mass guerrilla warfare in the occupied areas, consolidate the struggle in the border areas, launch guerrilla warfare in the Chiang-controlled areas, strengthen the construction of people's armed forces, continue to ensure a continuous replenishment training of troops to the front line, ensure the completion of war service tasks, strengthen military industrial construction, strengthen the management of rear hospitals, etc. At the same time, the streamlining of rear organs and troops should be completed quickly to ensure that more than one-third of the streamlining is used to replenish the field army to support long-term operations. Secondly, we must strengthen the mass work in the counter-offensive and the completion of the task of implementing land reform. It is required to strictly implement the Three Main Rules of Discipline and Eight Points for Attention and urban discipline, strengthen the class education of land reform and the people's army in the troops, the army universally participates in the land reform movement, armed to stand up for the peasants, especially in the new areas, we must combine with the local to vigorously mobilize the masses, universally organize armed work teams to open up new area work, and resolutely give punishment to those who interfere with and prevent the struggle of the masses from degenerating, until they are expelled from the Party and the army and handed over to the people for disposal. All objects of struggle hated by the masses hidden in the troops are all handed over to the local authorities for handling. Thirdly, we must strictly implement financial and economic policies, vigorously promote production and economy, and all shops and factories of the troops are uniformly managed and operated by the financial and economic offices, resolutely obey laws and regulations and unified leadership, cherish manpower and material resources, implement scientific calculations, and establish a long-term war concept. Rear organs universally reduce their living standards. No matter the front or the rear, no matter the Party, government, army, people, or school, they should oppose eating and drinking, extravagance and waste. Materials seized in war must be included in the government and must not be wasted for private ownership to increase the financial income of the entire region. Deputy Commander Teng pointed out that the above three-in-one tasks cannot be separated. In order to ensure the completion of the above tasks, the entire army is required to conduct a universal and in-depth ideological mobilization and education for the counter-offensive, so that it can understand the current situation and tasks and eliminate all bad ideological residues; all levels of leading cadres are required to be conscientious and learn humbly. It is necessary to combine courage and wisdom, and in any case, it is necessary to avoid arrogance and impatience; the entire army is required to further implement the mass line, improve the enthusiasm of the masses, and further develop a mass and widespread counter-offensive merit-making movement. Deputy Commander Teng clearly stated that only when we have fully full political emotions in our ideology and full preparations in our organization, so that our army will become a people's army with strong combat effectiveness that implements land reform and the mass line, this is the most necessary preparation for our counter-offensive.

    滕副司令员在军区会议上报告
    一年自卫战争军事斗争总结
    号召全军全力准备大反攻
    【本报特讯】在此次晋冀鲁豫军区会议上，滕副司令员对于本区一年来爱国自卫战争军事斗争经验，作了基本总结，并向全军提出全力准备大反攻中的基本任务。总结报告中，他首先对于一年来爱国自卫战争军事斗争成绩作了估计。他说一年以来，我们在党中央领导下，全区党政军民戮力同心，坚决斗争，完成了三大历史性的转变：由和平进入自卫战争，由游击战争进入大规模的正规战争，由减租减息反奸清算进入大规模土地改革。因而获得辉煌战绩，赢得了胜利，全区野战军、地方军（不包括民兵武装），歼灭了敌人达三十余万，掌握了一百二十余县城，还有八十余个县是边地或是敌后，但游击战争已普遍展开，政令畅达。全区人口已恢复年前数量。我区已由敌进我退、互相拉锯形势转入反攻。在各军区作战特点方面，滕副司令员说，以军区野战军战绩比较，太岳军区野战军战绩较大，四、五、六月立功计划中，太岳提的数目最多（一万至一万一千人），四、五两月即已超过三个月的计划，歼敌达一万三千人。豫皖苏某一兵团战绩很大，半年来曾攻克十六座县城，一年来该区全体军民坚持敌后斗争，粉碎了敌人六七次大扫荡，扩大解放区一倍。在分区部队中，太行五分区部队亦有良好之战绩，今年一、二、三月份完成并超过立功计划三倍。冀鲁豫在游击战争中有很多新的创造，特别是控制农村阵地，一手拿枪一手分田，在残酷斗争中实行土地改革，坚持了黄河南岸敌后广大地区的斗争。在这一年中，不论那个军区，战斗力都是一天比一天提高，地方兵团不仅已能消灭敌人正规军一个连、一个营，就是一个正规团也能干脆彻底的把它消灭。一年中收复了四十余座县城。一年消灭敌人三十多万中，地方兵团即消灭了十一万。大量的地方兵团已升级为野战军，现在野战军数量已达到全区武装三分之二，这是一个伟大的胜利。
    兵员补充与人民参战方面，滕副司令员说，一年来，由于我们人民军队，为人民保卫了土地，得到广大人民热情拥护，前后二十余万翻身农民自动参加人民解放军。在每次作战中，都有成千成万的群众自动参战，抬伤兵、运子弹、磨米磨面、烧汤烧水，前线后方，都在紧张的为战争服务，形成人民战争的壮观。但在作战初期，参战民力与军队的比例仍嫌过大，今年豫北战役，就做到一兵一夫，节约了很多民力。
    关于爱国自卫战争军事斗争中的基本经验，滕副司令员扼要的提出八点：
    一、必须坚决克服和平幻想。这主要表现在对蒋介石这个卖国贼估计不够，对他的和平欺骗信以为真，必须认识蒋介石是人民公敌，是中国人民解放的绊脚石，是达到中国独立解放的最大障碍，必须严格整顿纪律，向一切蜕化思想，右倾退缩现象作无情斗争；必须坚定军民胜利信心，提倡英勇奋斗不惜牺牲，拿出一切力量向敌人作坚决斗争；必须强调服从组织领导，团结一心，一致对敌，才能转变斗争局势。自卫战争开始时，曾有若干干部，背离群众，退却逃跑，有的右倾退缩，但由于我们及时的整顿了纪律，整顿了后方，坚决撤消了不称职的人员，大胆提拔了一批顽强战斗与人民结合的新的积极分子，坚持沦陷区斗争，这样使本区战局在极短时期内完成了决定性的转变。经验证明，凡在思想上有坚强领导和教育，能经常向一切蜕化思想作斗争，迅速放下包袱，取得思想上一致的，其部队战斗力的提高也最快。经验又证明，战争是严重的考验，无论个人和部队在战争中均有极大变化，凡能保持思想上不间断的领导与进步的，才能适应新形势的变化，否则就会掉队落伍，甚至被新形势所淘汰。
    二、必须坚决贯彻毛主席集中优势兵力歼灭敌人有生力量的作战指导方针，不仅在战役上而且在战术上。经验证明，凡能集中力量实行宽大机动，不计一城一地得失，不和敌人牛抵角，而能积极寻找和创造敌人弱点，以优于敌人五、六倍乃至十倍之兵力，歼敌一个团，一个营，不打无把握的消耗仗，必打有把握的歼灭战即能每战必胜，部队战斗力也能迅速提高，逼使敌人进行防御，分散兵力陷于被动。我们必须用智慧作战，学会两套本领，对自己部队下命令，也学会向敌人下命令，调动敌人使敌人必须服从我们的命令。如果打了不成功的战斗或消耗仗，应该首先检查战斗的指导者，尔后才去检查战斗的执行者。
    三、运动战是今天自卫战争的主要战争形式，但必须辅以游击战争，建立敌后战线。为此必须坚持沦陷区斗争，放手发动沦陷区群众性的游击战争，与人民同生死共患难，为人民撑腰，实行一手拿枪一手分田，敌进我进，敌住我进的方针。经验证明，只要我们决心坚持，即能坚持任何地区的斗争，坚持即能胜利。只要我们为群众而战，才有群众性的参战，只要我们放手发动群众为农民武装撑腰，大力控制地主，群众就会硬起来，热烈分田分粮，地主就会软下去，我们即能控制农村广大阵地。反是，一切认为游击战争中不能实行土地改革的观点，均必须予以改正。只要我们掌握武装拳头，积极打击敌人，使腹地坚持与外线机动及集中与分散灵活相结合，广泛开展土地斗争（地道地雷）和联防斗争，我们即能粉碎敌人的任何扫荡。只要我们有明确坚定的政策，坚决予反动恶霸地主以镇压，对胁从及动摇地主以宽大，对中立和掩护我工作之地主以奖励，地主阶级即必分化，我们可以取得农村绝对优势来缩小敌人社会基础至最小程度。但有些地区对地主的假面目警惕不足，以至与地主开和平会是错误的。
    四、必须在作战中进行建军，实行一面战斗一面建设。必须积极战斗，从战斗锻炼中培养提高野战军地方军的战斗力，适时不断的将地方兵团升级为野战军，使野战军数量达到总兵员三分之二，以适应大反攻的需要。
    五、必须普遍实行群众路线，恢复古田会议精神，并使之贯彻到作战练兵等工作中去，以广泛提高干部与战斗员的积极性和创造性。必须认识多数的群众的意见集中起来就是党的政策，不是用党的政策领导者的意见去修改群众的要求，而是根据群众的意见和要求，来修改党的政策和领导者的意见。这是群众路线的总精神。根据一年经验，开展群众路线有以下几个内容：
    甲、必须领导与群众结合，首先要求领导干部虚心学习，勇于接受别人和下层的意见和经验，敢于自我批评。其次干部的以身作则甘苦与共关心体贴下层，这对鼓舞战士情绪，干群团结、开展群众运动关系极大，再次是放手开展民主，除作战命令外，领导上应有意识的组织群众对一切问题进行民主讨论，发表意见提出建议并发扬“诸葛亮会”的形式，特别要实行经济公开，由群众自己经营管理。领导机关应深入下层，倾听和搜集群众的经验和意见，加以总结提高，再在群众中坚持下去，教育和提高部队，造成一种风尚。
    乙、互助互学和诉苦运动。互助组是一种很好的形式，它对于作战练兵群众工作巩固部队均有极大的推动作用。使新老战士解放战士互学长处互相帮助（即所谓三合一教育和记好学好运动），特别是普遍开展群众诉苦运动更为要紧。这是一种提高部队阶级觉悟阶级自觉的群众性的思想运动。凡诉苦运动进行得好的部队，战斗力提高得都很快。陈赓兵团城市纪律很好，主要就是通过群众性的学好记好运动来推动的。
    丙、多奖励少批评，广泛开展英模运动，提拔积极分子，经过英模运动造成新英雄主义的高潮。这是提高群众积极性的重要步骤。
    丁、从开展英模运动进一步普遍开展为人民立功运动，提倡人人立功和立功竞赛，特别是领导干部首先拟定计划以身作则做出立功成绩最为重要。此外还应经过报功贺功等形式，使地方与军队进一步密切起来，结合地方党政及群众来推动军队的政治工作。这已成为政治工作的新发展。
    戊、创造与培养典型积蓄经验普及全军，凡能真正进行了上述内容并使之继续发展进步的，其部队就表现得生气勃勃，进步迅速，纪律良好，战斗力很快提高，干部思想问题也大大减少，干部也均感到工作胜任愉快，积极创造性空前提高，一切工作容易推动执行。
    六、必须正确执行财政经济政策和解决战争供应问题，一方面应全力保障前线军需供给，动员一切人力物力支援前线，努力提高军工生产，保证源源不断供给前线以队员和干部，反对百废俱兴；另一方面应力求节约，力戒铺张浪费，进行科学的计算和组织，爱惜民力物力，紧缩后方，降低后方机关部队生活水平，适应长期战争和民力负担的条件。必须服从统一领导。遵守法令，反对单从局部和本位出发。在后勤组织上经验证明，党政军民统一组织的各级后勤指挥部和随军办事处，是一种最好的战勤组织形式，它有强大的动员力、组织力，它能统一调剂力量，科学的计算力量。它在自卫战争中已发挥了伟大作用。
    七、必须加强练兵，在战斗中提高部队的战术和政治水平，过去几个月中，群众路线的练兵工作已普遍开展起来，其主要内容：
    甲、战斗空隙中的练兵，抓紧一切可利用的时间进行训练，甚至一面战斗一面训练，白天休息夜间训练，能练一天算一天，练一月算一月。
    乙、战斗与训练相结合，用啥学啥，力求适应战斗实际，使战斗与训练反复结合，训练为了战斗，战斗改进训练。反对形式和机械的整齐划一，各个部队应从下而上展开群众性战术检查，评定伤亡（这是极重要的教育方式，必须普遍提倡一般经验有一半伤亡可以避免），总结经验并接受其他部队的良好经验以拟定和突击自己所需要的训练课目，使这些经验迅速运用到训练中去。提倡普遍进行战斗直前的战斗演习。
    丙、互助学习实行官教兵、兵教兵、兵教官，以及三合一的教育。
    丁、干部训练：中下级干部轮番调到训练队与军政大学学习，着重整理经验进行演习，这是保存干部，减少干部不必要的伤亡，提高干部指挥能力与战术技术水平的很好方法。高级上级干部着重组织自学，旅纵队级军区级以上应多召集必要的干部会议，总结经验、讨论时事政策和思想问题。有时高级领导机关可举行短期（十天半月）的高干学习会，对于高级上级干部的思想领导应是军队党的极重要的工作。此外，为解决部队干部的缺乏，抽调和选拔地方干部参军，加以短期训练到部队服务已成为我们很好经验和制度。
    戊、必须使新战士和解放战士经过短期训练后补入部队。普遍组织补充团，每纵至少一个，训练时间至少一个月。首先着重政治教育进行诉苦报恩运动，在这一基础上进行军事训练。经验证明，凡经过训练的新战士解放战士至少可减少伤亡一半以上。同时补充团还可保证部队获得不断的补充。这是连续战斗中不可缺少的组织。
    己、军事政治教育必须密切结合，政治工作保证作战练兵任务的完成。
    八、必须强化一元化领导，健全各级党委会必须健全野战军纵队、旅、团党委会组织，这是新建立的组织，各级政委必须学会作党委书记的工作以代替过去的工作方式。只有这样，才能使前线、敌后战线和后方战线斗争统一起来，使军队本身的作战、群众工作、财经生产工作三大任务统一起来，使领导集团中的干部经过党委民主讨论，在认识与行动上首先取的一致，以便于推动下层执行和发挥全党积极性，集中使用力量取得胜利。
    最后，滕副司令员号召全军必须全力准备大反攻，坚决完成三大任务。首先必须继续大量消灭我区周围之蒋军。为此要求加强建设新的野战军、提高野战军的战斗力，加强战斗锻炼与军政训练，学习毛主席的军事思想，学会迂回战和阵地战，加强工炮兵建设，集中机动的进攻敌人，一切可以消灭的敌人和收复的地方必须消灭和收复；要求加强军区建设，明确军区工作任务，继续独立自主的发挥沦陷区群众游击战争，巩固边沿区斗争，开展蒋管区游击战争，加强人民武装建设，继续保证对前线兵员的源源补充训练，保证战勤工作任务完成，加强军工建设，加强后方医院的管理等，同时应迅速完成后方机关部队的精简，保证精简三分之一以上，以充实野战军支持长期作战。其次必须加强反攻中的群众工作及贯彻土地改革任务的完成，要求严格执行三大纪律八项注意和城市纪律，加强部队土地改革和人民军队的阶级教育，军队普遍参加土地改革运动，武装为农民撑腰，尤其新区必须结合地方大力发动群众，普遍组织武装工作队开辟新区工作，对干涉与阻止群众斗争之蜕化分子坚决给以处分，直至开除党籍军籍交人民处置，一切隐匿于部队中之群众痛恨的斗争对象一律交地方处理。再次必须严格执行财经政策，厉行生产节约，部队商店工厂一律统一财经办事处管理经营，坚决服从法令与统一领导，爱惜人力物力，实行科学计算，树立长期战争观念。后方机关普遍降低生活水平，不论前方和后方，不论党政军民学，均应反对大吃大喝，铺张浪费，战争缴获物资必须归入政府，不得浪费私有以增加全区财政收入。滕副司令员指出：以上三位一体的任务，不能分割。为保证上述任务完成，要求全军来一次普遍深入的反攻思想动员和教育，使之认识当前的形势和任务肃清一切不良思想残余；要求各级领导干部兢兢业业，虚心学习。使勇敢与智谋相结合，在任何情况下要切忌骄傲急燥；要求全军进一步实行群众路线，提高群众积极性并进一步开展一个群众性的，广泛的反攻立功运动。滕副司令员明确的提出：只有在思想上有了充分饱满的政治情绪，和组织上有了充分准备，使我们的军队更加成为一支贯彻土地改革与群众路线的，有顽强战斗力的人民军队，这就是我们反攻最必须的准备。（毓明）
