Xinhua News Agency, Jinji Luyu, 25th (Delayed Telegram): Chiang Kai-shek's heinous crime of breaching the dikes and flooding the liberated areas came to light on the night of the 17th of this month. On August 17th, Chiang's troops dug two breaches, Qian'e and Xinzhuang (located north of Guantai), on the Yellow River levee near Guantai in Fengqiu County, each breach being over a hundred yards wide. The raging Yellow River water burst forth northward from the breaches, pouring down with a deafening roar that could be heard for dozens of miles. The water rushed directly towards Dacheji in Changyuan County, north of the Yellow River's north bank. From Dacheji, it flowed north along the levee, reaching Menggang on the morning of the 24th. It is estimated that the flood will proceed along the northern bank levee towards the old levee south of Kunwu (newly established county, located southeast of Yanggu). The levees of Changyuan, Hua County, and Puyang County will be eroded by the flood. The massive engineering project that hundreds of thousands of laborers in the liberated areas had been repairing day and night is on the verge of destruction. Upon hearing this terrible news, the democratic governments and the broad masses of the people in the counties along the river are, with extreme indignation, doing everything they can to rush to the breach to block it and carry out rescue efforts. The breach at Qian'e, Guantai, is located at a bend in the Yellow River on the north bank and is the most dangerous part of the river. A breach occurred here in 1934, flooding Changyuan, Puyang, Fanxian, and Shou Zhang counties.

Xinhua News Agency, Jinji Luyu, 25th: When the news of Chiang Kai-shek's breaching of the dikes reached the counties along the river, alarm bells rang along the dikes. The democratic governments held emergency meetings overnight to deploy personnel to rush to the breaches to block the flow. The river defense troops along the river immediately went to the breaches to carry out rescue operations. The people of Puyang, Fanxian, Shou Zhang, and other places, supported the old and the young, evacuated in an orderly manner to the safe areas designated by the democratic governments outside the Golden Levee. The peasants painfully harvested all the half-ripe sorghum and unripe millet. They angrily stated, "This year's crops are the best in decades, but Chiang Kai-shek came to flood us and destroy our livelihood. If we don't eliminate him, we won't have a way to survive!" The young and strong people rushing to the dikes to block the breaches are advancing rapidly.
