　　Dagong Goods Depot Announcement

　　This depot was previously ordered to close down. Due to numerous procedures, it has not been finalized sooner. We hereby announce again that all shops in various regions that have had procedural relations with this depot must bring their receipts for settlement before September 10th. Late submissions will be considered invalid and will not be processed.

　　This store has already calculated the profits for the first half of the year, with a dividend of one yuan per share. The dividend distribution period is set from the 1st to the 15th of this month (lunar calendar). Shareholders from various regions are requested to bring their stock certificates to collect their dividends. If dividends are not collected after the deadline, the dividends will be added to the shares. This is a special announcement.
