[Report from Taiyue, August 10th] The movement of class investigation and ideological examination within General Chen Geng's troops has gradually penetrated the company level. Local corps in the entire area have also subsequently begun studying land reform. Teams seven and eight of a certain brigade, in their discussions, resolved many confused concepts. In particular, the discussion about whether the families of comrades from landlord backgrounds should be subjected to struggle by the masses was very heated. Finally, the conclusion was reached: "We came out ourselves, risking life and limb, for the sake of the revolution and the masses. Since the family has exploited the masses and committed counter-revolutionary acts, they should be struggled against." Whether or not to take care of them should be decided by the masses based on the situation, and should not be requested by oneself. The direct unit of the 19th sub-district also corrected many erroneous ideas, such as "I won't struggle against others, and others won't struggle against me," etc. Based on these phenomena, discussions were organized. During the discussions, some comrades from poor backgrounds recounted their sufferings and wept bitterly. People from landlord backgrounds were stimulated and sympathetic, and automatically exposed various acts of exploitation by their families, enabling everyone to recognize the many past wrong ideas, recognize that landlords are our enemies, and resolutely break with landlords ideologically. After this movement, practical results have been achieved in some troops. A comrade from a wealthy peasant family in the Sixth Company of a certain brigade, named Su Zhong, asked the instructor to write a letter home, advising his uncle to distribute the land to the peasants, so as to quickly realize "land to the tillers."

　　陈赓将军所部学习土地改革
    【本报太岳十日电】陈赓将军所部的查阶级查思想运动，已逐渐深入连队，全区地方兵团，亦随后展开学习土地改革。某旅七、八两队在讨论中，解决了不少糊涂观念。尤其是讨论到地主家庭出身的同志的家庭应当不应当让群众斗争，争论得非常热烈，最后，得出了结论：“自己出来，出生入死，就是为了革命，为了群众，家庭既然剥削了群众，既然作了反革命的事情，就应当斗争。”照顾不照顾，亦应由群众看情形决定，不应自己提出要求。十九分区直属队同样纠正了不少错误思想，如“我不斗人，人也不斗我”的等等思想。根据这些现象，组织讨论，讨论中一些贫苦出身的同志诉起苦来，痛哭流涕，地主出身的人被刺激而同情，自动揭露其家庭剥削人的各种行为，使大家认清了过去的许多错误想法，认清了地主是我们的敌人，坚决与地主从思想上分家。经过这一运动后，已在某些部队中得到实际效果，某旅六连封建富农家庭出身的苏中同志，请指导员代写家信，劝叔父将地分给农民，以便很快实现耕者有其田。
