　　Getting Mutual Aid Ready to Compare Achievements After Autumn
  　Major Brigades in Xishe Compete to Fertilize 荒 and Plow Wheat Fields
    [This newspaper, PingShun News] On August 8th, Xishe Village in the Fifth District held a village-wide production mutual aid merit-making conference. The village has three mutual aid brigades. After evaluation by the conference, the Third Brigade achieved the greatest results in the weeding campaign and was awarded three major merits. The First Brigade was awarded two major merits. The Second Brigade did not receive any merit, and everyone was not satisfied. Activist Cao Ancai said, "This time our Second Team didn't get any merit, which is really disappointing. We must quickly seize the time to rectify mutual aid, find out the problems, and work hard. We must win the top merit in the autumn merit-making meeting." Cao Gou said, "Let's re-establish the merit standard and compare based on actual results. We must win several merits." All team members have such confidence. On August 11th, taking advantage of the rain and the inability to work in the fields, they held a whole day and two nights of rectification mutual aid team meetings. At the meeting, Cao Ancai said, "If the main beam is not straight, the second beam will be crooked, and if the third beam is not straight, the whole house will collapse. If the team leader and captain don't take care of things, how can the mutual aid team be successful? The captain only cares about his own life all day long and doesn't solve problems. What's the point?" After a deep self-examination, the whole team found four reasons for the collapse of mutual aid: 1. The captain and team leader are not responsible, do not solve problems, and do not play a leading and promoting role; 2. The team leader is undisciplined and scattered, and does not hold many meetings to discuss issues; 3. Village cadres do not help; 4. Lack of labor. After finding the reasons for the collapse, the team leaders and captains were re-elected, and the village cadres also made self-criticisms and provided good assistance. The slogan put forward by the whole team is: "From now on, we must ensure that the captain and team leader take the lead, and all team members work hard together. We won't have to worry about doing mutual aid well." They also organized semi-labor and auxiliary labor. To compensate for the inadequacy of auxiliary labor, they formulated a merit-making plan for before autumn: 1. The team's 250 mu of wheat fields will be plowed three times to guarantee; 2. Every mu of wheat field must be fertilized with 80 loads of 荒肥; 3. Wheat must be planted before the White Dew solar term; 4. Repair autumn harvest sickles and ropes to ensure that one piece of land is cut, one piece of sod is turned, and no stubble is left. Based on these conditions, they challenged the Third Team. If these conditions are not met at the autumn merit-making meeting, they will lose a large banner. The Third Team became even more motivated after receiving the letter of challenge. The whole village proposed: "No one should be idle, no labor should be wasted, barren land should be reclaimed and trees should be planted when it is cloudy and rainy, and a badger watching team should be organized at night to prevent them from eating corn." After the rain on August 17th, when they could not work in the fields, the production director and labor hero led 218 full and semi-laborers and planted 4,719 peach and apricot trees in two days. As soon as the weather cleared up, they immediately went to the fields. Now the whole village is involved in the wave of fertilizing 荒 and plowing wheat fields. Cao Ancai said, "We'll see who's better at the autumn merit-making meeting!" (Yongming, Ermei, Chen Ding)

　　整好互助秋后比功
  　西社各大队竞赛薰荒翻麦地
    【本报平顺讯】五区西社村八月八日召开全村生产互助立功大会，全村共有三个互助大队，经大会评选，在锄苗运动中，第三大队的成绩最大，立了三个大功；第一大队立了两大功。第二大队没有立了功，大家不服劲，积极分子曹安才说：“这次咱二队没有立上功，实在败兴，咱赶快抓紧时间，整顿互助，找出毛病来，好好干起来，秋后立功会上非占了全村的头等功不行。”曹狗则说：“咱重新订出立功标准来，按实际成绩来比，非立上几功不行。”全体组员都有这样的信心，八月十一号抽下雨不能上地的空，召开了一整天与两黑夜的整顿互助队会，在会上，曹安才说：“大梁不正二梁歪，三梁不正垮了台，组长、队长就不管事，互助组怎能搞好，队长一天光干他的生活，有问题不解决，那还算话哩。”全队经过了深刻的自我检讨，找出了互助垮台有四个原因：１、队长、组长不负责任，不解决问题，没有起带头与推动作用；２、组长自流散漫，不多开会商量问题；３、村干部不帮助；４、劳力缺乏。找出了垮台原因后，重新选举了组长队长，村干部也作了检讨，好好帮助，全队提出的口号是：“今后要做到队长组长起带头，全体组员齐加油，互助搞好不发愁”。并把半劳力辅助劳力组织起来，辅助劳力的不足，订出了秋前的立功计划：一、全队麦地二百五十亩，保证翻三遍；二、每亩麦地要薰荒肥八十担；三；白露前要种完麦子；四、修理秋收镰刀绳子，做到黄一块割一块垡一块，不留一分茬地。根据这些条件向三队提出挑战，秋后立功会上完不成这些条件输大旗一面；三队接到挑战书，劲头更大了。全村提出：“不闲一人，不浪费一个劳力，天阴下雨开荒栽树，夜间组织看獾队，防止它吃玉茭”。八月十七号下雨后不能上地，生产主任劳动英雄领导二百一十八个全半劳力，两天栽了桃杏树四千七百一十九棵，天一晴好马上上地。现在全村都卷入薰荒肥翻麦地浪潮中，曹安才说：“秋后立功会上见高低！”（永明、二梅、陈丁）
