　　Masses in Yantou Broaden Their Thinking
　　Late Seedlings Weeded a Second Time
　　[Report from This Newspaper, Shexian] This year in Yantou, the weather was dry and rainfall was late. After most of the first weeding of the late seedlings was completed, the masses developed thoughts such as "the hot season is over," and "once autumn arrives, hang up the hoes," hindering the second and third weedings. After discovering this thinking, a meeting of cadre group leaders was convened on August 21st for a sudden mobilization, putting forward the slogan: "Weed autumn seedlings three times, and the grain will be abundant and full." Liu Yunting said: "Our village still has 350 mu of land that has not been weeded, with a total of 193 laborers. Excluding 18 sick people and 50 people processing indigo, there are still 125 people. If each person weeds one mu per day, it will be completed in less than three days. There are also 70 mu of radishes unweeded. There are 71 women who can go to the fields, each mu requiring two workdays, which can be completed in two days." After calculating, they researched methods of converting work credits and exchanging labor, flexibly assigning tasks, and reducing wages to five jin of rice. They also proposed accumulating fertilizer to prepare for wheat planting. Labor hero Chen Yutang said: "Rotting 200 mu of indigo seedlings will accumulate 6,000 dan of fertilizer." Zhang Gushi said: "Replacing our old kang stoves with new ones can accumulate 20,000 tuo of fertilizer, averaging 20 tuo per mu." The Women's Association chairman said: "Women burning firewood to smoke soil clods and sweeping the floor to rot dregs are all good fertilizers." The next day, the group leaders actively led the entire village to rush to weed once, completed the second weeding, and then launched a fertilizer accumulation campaign to expand wheat fields.

　　[Report from This Newspaper, Shexian] The Taicun Village in the Fourth District took advantage of the rainy weather. All groups in the village were discussing how to weed the seedlings. The Middle Street group of Hou Shutai, with ten households and nine full laborers, proposed during the discussion, "We have the labor to weed the seedlings, which is not a problem, but our group doesn't have any livestock to plant wheat, which is a difficulty!" Everyone suggested giving a few livestock workdays to the Hou Tingxian group. The Luzhenlin group, with six households, five laborers, and three livestock, proposed merging with the Hou Tingxian group because they were assigned labor duties and worried about wolves when children were left unattended in the fields. Under these circumstances, the three groups carried out a major merger and publicly elected Hou Tingxian as the leader. The weeding method was: weeding along the east and west roads, calculating how much land there was and how much labor was needed, assessing work credits per mu, and scoring based on labor efficiency (ten points per workday). The entire group had 102 mu of unweeded millet, 30 mu of beans, and 65 mu of vegetables. On the first day, 23 full laborers and 16 half laborers (including five girls and two women) weeded 62 mu in one day. In the evening, they summarized that they had saved 21 workdays. Everyone exclaimed, "I never dreamed we could weed so much today!" An elderly person said, "With more people, adding strength means three or four mu, and seven or eight mu of land are finished in one go. If one person weeds, they can't weed it and will just scratch their heads!" The next day, they weeded 24 mu due to rain. By the morning of the third day, it was finished, and they also weeded three mu of contracted land, saving five workdays. The work originally planned for three days was completed in two and a half days, excluding the five people on labor duty. They are now rushing to plant. (Qing Hua, Ju Cai, Zhi Sheng)

　　沿头群众打通思想
  　晚苗赶锄二遍
    【本报涉县讯】沿头今年天旱落雨迟，晚苗头遍大部锄完，群众即产生伏天已过，“立了秋挂锄钩”等思想，阻碍着锄二遍三遍。发现这种思想后，于八月二十一日召开干部组长会议，进行突击动员，提出口号：“秋苗锄三遍，粮食多打籽饱满”。刘运亭说：“咱村还有三百五十亩地未锄，共一百九十三个劳力，除病号十八人，打靛五十人外，还有一百二十五个人，每天一人锄一亩，不用三天就完成，还有七十亩萝卜未，妇女有七十一人能上地，每亩两个工，两天完成。计算后，研究出折工、变工办法，死分活计，降低工资为五斤米。并提出集肥准备种麦，劳英陈玉堂说：“把二百亩靛秧沤烂，积肥六千担。”张古师说：“咱旧炕锅台换成新的，能积肥两万驮，每亩平均二十驮。”妇会主席说：“妇女烧火薰土块，扫地沤渣，都是好粪。”第二天，各组长积极领导全村突击锄一遍，完成二遍，再开展积肥运动扩大麦田。（庆荣）
    【本报涉县讯】四区台村利用天下雨时，全村各组都酝酿如何锄苗。中街侯书太组十户九个全劳力，讨论中大家提出“咱有劳力锄苗倒不成问题，就是种麦子咱组都没牲口，是个困难！”大家意见要给侯廷贤组变几个牲口工；芦珍林组六户，五个劳力，三个牲口，因轮到支差儿童无人领导上地怕狼，提出要给侯廷贤组合并。在这种情况下，三组进行了大合并，公推侯廷贤领导。锄地办法：按东路西路来锄，计算有多少地，需多少工，按亩评工，按劳动效果得分（一工十分）。全组没锄的黍子一百零二亩，豆子三十亩，蔬菜六十五亩，第一天二十三个全劳力，十六个半劳力（内有女儿童五个，妇女二个），一天锄了六十二亩，晚上总结省了二十一个工。大家都嚷着说：“今天梦也梦不到能锄这样多！”一个上年纪的说：“人多了加加劲就是三四亩，七亩八亩的地块一下就完了，要是一个人锄，锄不出来光搔头！”第二天，因下雨锄了二十四亩，第三天上午便完了，还锄了三亩包工地，省工五个。原计划三天的活，除了五个支差的，两天半就光了，现正突击卜。（庆华、聚财、志胜）
