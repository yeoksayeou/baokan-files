Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 27th -- Washington Dispatch: The US Congress adjourned yesterday (the 26th). Truman had already announced on the 14th that he had no intention of calling a special session of Congress in the fall. Therefore, barring special circumstances, the US Congress will not reconvene until January 3rd next year. In this session, under the "virtual formation of a reactionary party" (resolution of the American Progressive Citizens Association) by the reactionary factions of both the Republican and Democratic parties, and despite the opposition of progressive figures inside and outside the US Congress, several extremely reactionary resolutions were passed. The most important of these are the Aid to Greece and Turkey Act passed in May, the $350 million foreign aid act passed independently after the end of the UN Relief and Rehabilitation Administration, the notorious Taft-Hartley Anti-Labor Act passed in June, and the bill passed by a joint session of both houses of Congress on July 24th merging the War and Navy Departments into the Department of Defense. The passage of these bills fully exposes the frantic ambition of US monopoly capital, through its Congressional agents, to carry out domestic oppression of the working people and external expansionist policies. Currently, the bills shelved in Congress, to be passed next year, include Truman's proposal to allow 400,000 European "refugees" (actually mostly Quislings and war criminals) into the US over four years, as well as universal conscription. As for the so-called "Marshall Plan for European Aid," it has not yet been submitted to Congress, so its discussion will be delayed until at least next spring.

    美国会休会
    通过若干反动决议
    马歇尔计划未讨论
    【新华社陕北二十七日电】华盛顿讯：美国会已于昨（二十六日）休会。杜鲁门早在十四日即宣布无召开秋季国会特别会议之意，故如无特殊情况，美国会将延至明年一月三日始行复会。此届国会在共和与民主两党反动派“事实上已结成一个反动政党”（美国进步公民协会决议）之下，虽有美国会内外进步人士之反对，仍通过了若干极其反动的决议。其重要者有五月通过之援助希土法案、联总结束后三亿五千万元对外单独救济法案、六月通过的臭名昭著之塔虎特——哈特莱反劳工法案，及七月二十四日两院联席会议所通过的合并陆海军部为国防部的法案。此等法案之通过，充分暴露了美国独占资本经过其国会代理人以实行对内压迫劳苦人民对外实行扩张政策之疯狂野心。目前搁置于国会中留待明年通过之法案，尚有杜鲁门提出的美国在四年内允许欧洲四十万“难民”（实际上多为吉斯林分子及战犯）入美案，以及普遍强迫军训案等。致于所谓马歇尔援欧计划”，迄今尚未提交国会，故其讨论至少将延至明春。
