　　Huolu Independent Battalion
  　Three Victories in Ten Days
  　Eliminating Over Thirty Chiang Kai-shek and Puppet Troops Seizing Grain
    [Report from this newspaper] The Huolu Independent Battalion achieved three victories in ten days, obtaining significant results. On July 10th, over 200 security personnel from the Tenth Column of the Nantongye Factory invaded Nangu Yiyi to seize grain. Upon hearing this, our battalion swiftly launched an attack. As soon as we approached the enemy, we charged in bravely, repelling them, killing and wounding five, causing the enemy to flee in panic. On the 17th, over 200 enemies from Nantongye invaded the North and South Gu Yi again to seize grain and cover the escape of landlords. Upon hearing this, our battalion used a sudden maneuver to outflank the enemy's retreat route – east of the village of Beigu Yi – intercepting the enemy and defeating them, killing and wounding 12 enemy soldiers including a platoon leader. We intercepted ten large carts, fifteen head of livestock, and ten thousand catties of grain from the fleeing landlords. On the 20th, the county battalion took the initiative to ambush enemy troops from Dachang Township who were out to seize grain. At 10:00 AM that day, more than 40 members of the Dachang Township Militia and the Huolu County Self-Defense Force, carrying a light machine gun, invaded Hanzhuang to seize grain. As the enemy entered our ambush area, we bravely charged and killed most of them, capturing seven alive, killing six, and wounding seven, including the captain of the Dachang Township Militia. We seized ten rifles and over 600 rounds of ammunition. In summary, in the three battles, we eliminated over 30 enemies, seized ten rifles, over 600 rounds of ammunition, ten large carts, fifteen head of livestock, and over ten thousand catties of grain. In the three battles, we only suffered one minor injury. The enemy-to-own casualties ratio was 37 to 1. Our victory exceeded the July plan for annihilating the enemy. (Duan Shuangyin)
    [Report from this newspaper] In Xiuwu County, after the "July 1st" county-wide commendation and merit-seeking conference, on July 5th, Comrade Qiao Zhensheng, the flag-bearer of the border struggle of the Second District Militia, led the militia, cooperating with the Armed Work Team and the Ligu Militia, to penetrate deep behind enemy lines. After a fierce battle, they killed a local tyrant, captured six treacherous bullies alive, and brought back five head of livestock, achieving a first victory. On the afternoon of the 6th, the Armed Work Team, militia, and plainclothes team of the Public Security Bureau of the Third District advanced directly behind enemy lines south of the Daoqing Railway, sweeping treacherous bullies in Zhouzhuang, Liuzhuang, Licun, and other places, and intercepting treacherous bullies from Encun and Daiwang who were fleeing east with their families. They killed two enemies, wounded one, captured over 40 alive, and brought back over 50 head of livestock and over 50 sheep. On the night of the 7th, the Armed Work Team and militia of the Seventh District, in addition to covering sabotage operations, another group attacked Sulin south of the road, capturing four fleeing landlords and local tyrant self-defense members who were held under house arrest by the Fourth District, and rescuing over 40 masses who were deceived by enemy agents to live in the village. During this sabotage operation, female militia members of the Seventh District, under the leadership of Liu Fengying and Zhang Hongying, covered the Daoqing Highway sabotage operation. As far as our county is concerned, it was the first time for female militia members to participate in sabotage operations. At 10:00 AM on the 8th, a militia squad of the Seventh District, led by Comrade Zhang Yongan, once again penetrated deep into Sulin Village south of the Daoqing Railway, intercepting three masses and three head of livestock, and one horse-drawn cart who had been deceived into going there by treacherous bullies. That night, they also cooperated with a unit of the army and a militia company to drive the enemy out of Qinzhuang, burning all the enemy's large and small bunkers, more than a dozen in total.
