　　Making Surplus from Insufficiency
  　Renzhuang Accumulates Small Community Granary
    [This newspaper, Licheng News] Da Hui, a model cadre of Renzhuang Village in the Second District, recalled that during the famine of 1943, they did not take precautions early enough. By the time spring came for planting, the peasants had nothing to eat or drink and only thought about earning rice through sideline occupations, which simplified agriculture and greatly reduced production. Accepting this lesson, Lao Qin immediately convened a meeting of the entire group (18 households), based on the principle of making surplus from insufficiency, ensuring military and civilian food supplies, and supporting the front lines, to jointly study solutions. First, every household made a famine relief plan and carefully inventoried their possessions. This autumn harvest was converted into fine grains at a rate of 50%, plus grain funds. Based on a calculation of one catty of fine grain per person per day, only four households could eat until next summer, five households could eat until February, and the remaining nine households could only eat until the end of December this year. Comparing income and expenditure, those with insufficient income would make up for it with sideline occupations and handicrafts. After inventorying their possessions, the autumn harvest grain was converted into fine grain, and after deducting current consumption, the grain was stored in granaries. Each household selected its own custodian to store the food for the spring plowing season (January, February, March, and April), and the three groups mutually advised each other not to use the small community granary grain until January. Shen Lai Shun and two other custodians were selected to be responsible for leadership. (Shunqing, Guangbei, Shuquan, Renzhuang Communications Group)

　　从不足中做到有余
  　仁庄积小义仓
    【本报黎城讯】二区仁庄村，模范干部大，回忆四三灾荒时，没及早提防，及到春天种地时，农民没吃喝，只顾想法副业赚米吃，对农业是简单从事，减低生产很大。接受这经验，即劳芹，召开全组会议（十八户），本着从不足中做到有余，保证军需民食，支援前线的原则，共同研究克服办法。首先是家家做渡荒计划，详细清算家当。今年秋收以五成折成细粮，加上有粮款，每口每日以一斤细粮计算，计能吃到明年夏天者，只有四户，吃到二月者五户，其余九户都是只能吃到今年十二月底，收支对照，不足者以副业手工业来弥补。经清算家当后，把秋收粮食折细粮，除当前吃用，存仓，各家选出自家的保管人，把明年春耕期的食粮（正、二、三、四四个月）保存起来，并以三组互相劝告，不到正月决不动用小义仓粮，全选出申来顺等三个保管员负责领导。（顺庆、光北、书全、仁庄通讯组）
