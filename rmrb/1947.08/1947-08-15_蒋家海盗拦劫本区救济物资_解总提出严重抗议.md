　　Xinhua News Agency, Shandong, 13th. On July 27th, Chiang Kai-shek's warships intercepted seven ships transporting liaison and relief supplies near Jimu Islet off Longkou, seizing 179 tons of relief supplies. According to some of the shipowners who were robbed and escaped back to Yantai, the incident unfolded as follows: As early as April, the UNRRA relief ship "Wan Jian" loaded with relief supplies arrived at Yangjiaogou, preparing to unload and distribute them to the Jin-Ji-Lu-Yu area. However, due to continuous heavy rain and rough seas, unloading was impossible, so it returned to Yantai to be unloaded and temporarily stored pending transport. However, the UNRRA and the Executive Yuan consistently failed to fairly allocate transportation to the liberated areas for the delivery of relief supplies, resulting in the prolonged storage of the supplies in Yantai without being transferred. In order to ensure that relief supplies reached those in need as soon as possible, the Yantai Relief Administration, in collaboration with Commissioner Gao, the representative of the Jin-Ji-Lu-Yu Relief Association stationed in Yantai, arranged for a dozen sailboats to transport them in batches. The second batch consisted of seven sailboats: Xu Yuan Shun, Dong Fu Shun, Tong Cheng Shun, Jin Kuang Xing, Sun Xiang Shun, Yi Shun Xing, and Zhu Qin Shun, carrying a total of 179 tons of relief supplies. They set sail from Yantai on July 24th. Around 8:00 AM on July 27th, while sailing near Jimu Islet off Longkou, they were suddenly intercepted by the Chiang Kai-shek warship "Yongding," which had been lying in wait for several days. The shipowners presented the passports and shipping lists jointly issued by UNRRA and the Executive Yuan Relief Administration, but the Chiang Kai-shek naval personnel acted unreasonably and forcibly towed the Relief Administration relief ships behind the warship. By 4:00 PM, due to increasing wind and rain, towing became impossible, so they looted all the relief supplies and, after threatening the Relief Administration shipowners who were arguing for reason, sailed away. Currently, apart from the three ships Sun Xiang Shun, Jin Shun Xing, and Tong Cheng Shun being forced to dock in Longkou, the whereabouts of the other four ships remain unknown. The Yantai Relief Administration, through representatives from both UNRRA and the Executive Yuan Relief Administration stationed in Yantai, has lodged a serious protest with the Chiang Kai-shek government regarding the crimes of Chiang Kai-shek's pirate ships.

　　蒋家海盗拦劫本区救济物资
  　解总提出严重抗议
    【新华社山东十三日电】上月二十七日，龙口附近鸡母岵海面蒋舰，截劫解放运送联络救济物资七船，劫去救济物资一百七十九吨。据逃回烟台之部分被劫船主谈述事件经过如下：早在四月间，联总救济船“万俭号”载救济物资运抵羊角沟准备卸运晋冀鲁豫地区发放，当以连日大雨，海上风浪过大，无法卸货，遂回驶卸烟（台）暂存候运。但联、行是对解放区供运救济物资之交通工具，始终不予公平配发，致使该批物资长期存烟，未得转运。烟台解总为使救济物资早日送达被救济者手中，乃协同晋冀鲁豫救济分会驻烟代表高委员，有帆船十数只，分批运送。第二批计有帆船徐员顺、董福顺、同成顺、金旷兴、孙祥顺、益顺兴、诸勤顺七只，共载救济物资一百七十九吨，于七月二十四日启碇离烟，二十七日上午八时许行经龙口附近鸡母岵海面，突被伏伺多日之蒋兵舰“永定号”所载劫。各船主当将领、行总会同签发之护照及发货清单交验，蒋舰人员蛮不讲理，强将解总救济船只拖在兵舰后面带走。迄下午四时，因风雨交加，不能再拖，乃将救济物资全部劫掠，对道理力争之解总船主横加威胁后，扬长而去。现除孙祥顺、金顺兴、同成顺三船被迫于龙口靠岸外，其余四船，至今下落不明。烟台解总对蒋家海盗的罪行，已经由驻烟联总行总双方代表转向蒋政府提出严重抗议。
