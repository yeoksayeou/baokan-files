　　Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 15th: Chenggong Lake Dispatch: The Security Council continued to discuss the Indonesian issue from the 11th. After two days of intense debate, on the 12th, it passed a motion by eight votes to three to invite Indonesian representatives to attend the Security Council. Thus, the plot of US-British imperialism to use the excuse that the Republic of Indonesia was a non-independent sovereign state in order to conduct separate "mediation" by the US and Britain has failed. During the debate, former Indonesian Prime Minister Sjahrir and his assistant were also present. Soviet representative Gromyko strongly supported Indonesia's request for the right to speak, and the Indian representative also strongly argued that the Security Council must recognize Indonesia as a sovereign state in accordance with international law. The claim that Indonesia is "insufficient to fulfill its national obligations" is merely a one-sided statement by the Netherlands. After the Security Council concluded the debate on this issue, it proceeded to examine Indonesia's application for the International Arbitration Committee to mediate the Indonesian-Dutch dispute.
    Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 16th: Yogyakarta Dispatch: After Indonesian Prime Minister Sjarifuddin sternly rejected the US's proposal for separate "mediation" on the 6th, the US did not give up. A delegation led by Ford, the US Consul in Batavia, flew to Yogyakarta on the 11th and met with Sukarno and Sjarifuddin for three hours to inquire about Indonesia's attitude towards US "mediation". Ford flew back to Batavia on the same day. The Republic of Indonesia held a meeting on the 12th and decided to reject the US's separate "mediation" again and insisted on its original proposal to request the Security Council to resolve the Indonesian issue through international arbitration. The American reactionaries put on an ugly farce that backfired.
    Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 16th: Yogyakarta Dispatch: The Government of the Republic of Indonesia has issued a public statement condemning the Netherlands for its crime of breaking its promise and continuing to invade Indonesia. The statement said: From August 4th to 12th, the Netherlands violated the armistice agreement 292 times, including: Dutch aircraft flying over Indonesian airspace for reconnaissance 181 times, bombing Republic cities 8 times, ground armed forces shelling Republic positions 20 times, shelling from the sea 15 times, land attacks 15 times, local military operations 20 times, and expanding territory 22 times. In order to crush the enemy's breach of contract and attack, the Indonesian army launched a counterattack. On Madura Island, when the Dutch army launched an attack with armored vehicles and artillery, it was repelled by the Indonesian army, forcing the enemy to flee in panic. In central Java, southern Sumatra and other regions, the Indonesian army's blocking operations are underway.

　　美英单独“调停”阴谋破产
  　安理会通过邀印尼出席
    马都拉岛印尼军击退进犯荷军
    【新华社陕北十五日电】成功湖讯：安理会于十一日起继续讨论印尼问题，经两天激烈辩论后，十二日以八票对三票通过邀请印尼代表出席安理会。至此美英荷帝国主义借口印尼共和国为一非独立主权国，以便单独由美英“调停”之阴谋，遂告破产。在辩论时，印尼前总理沙利尔及其助理亦在座，苏联代表葛罗米柯亟力支持印尼关于发言权之请求，印度代表亦力主安理会必须根据国际法承认印尼系一主权国。所谓印尼“不足以担负起其国家义务”之说法，仅系荷兰片面之词。安理会于结束此一问题之辩论后，进而审查印尼所提由国际仲裁委员会调停印荷纠纷之申请书。
    【新华社陕北十六日电】日惹讯：印尼总理沙利佛丁于六日严词拒绝美国单独“调停”之建议后，美国仍不死心，美驻巴达维亚领事福特为首组成的使节团，复于十一日飞日惹，与苏加诺、沙利佛丁会谈三小时，就美国“斡旋”事探询印尼方面的态度，福特于同日飞返巴城。印尼共和国于十二日举行会议，决议再度拒绝美国单独“斡旋”，并坚持请求安理会以国际仲裁方式解决印尼问题之原议。美国反动派表演了一幕自讨没趣的丑剧。
    【新华社陕北十六日电】日惹讯：印尼共和国政府顷发表公报，谴责荷兰破约继续进犯印尼之罪行。该公报称：自八月四日至十二日止，荷兰破坏停战协定达二九二次，计：荷机飞越印尼领空侦察一八一次，空袭共和国城市八次，地面武装部队向共和国阵地炮击二十次，自海上炮击十五次，陆地攻击十五次，局部军事行动二十次，扩张领土二十二次。为了粉碎敌人破约进攻，印尼军进行反击，在马都拉岛荷军以装甲车和大炮配合发动攻击时，已被印尼军击退，并迫使敌人仓惶逃窜。在中部爪哇、苏岛南部等地区，印尼军的阻击战正在开展中。
