Xinhua News Agency, Jin-Cha-Ji, 3rd: Zhangjiakou News: Zhangjiakou, under the tyranny of Fu Zuoyi, has been dubbed by the people as "Second Mengjiang" (Note: "Mengjiang" refers to the rule of Japanese invaders and Han (Mongolian) traitors in Chahar and Suiyuan). For months, frequent household registration checks and sudden curfews, causing multiple scares in one night, have become commonplace. Gendarmes and police run rampant everywhere, beating ordinary people with fists and feet for the slightest displeasure, and not allowing them to utter a single groan. The bandit Fu has set up a large concentration camp in Zhangyuan, euphemistically calling it the "Zhangyuan Pacification Public Office Youth Training Corps," with the "Suspects Brigade" alone imprisoning 500 young people. The bandit Fu also dispatches special agents to monitor the actions of citizens. If anyone is found frequently reading street posters, they are secretly followed and questioned as to why they are so concerned about current affairs. A slightly unsatisfactory answer results in arrest. The burden of exorbitant taxes and levies is even heavier than during the Japanese occupation. As a result, business is sluggish, shops are closing one after another, and peddlers mostly make a living by selling American goods. Prices are soaring. In June, millet sold for 2,800 yuan per catty, sesame oil for 8,000 yuan per catty, and salt for 5,600 yuan per catty. Factories are closing down in large numbers, workers are unemployed and unable to survive, and the lives of the citizens have once again been plunged into the abyss of suffering of the Japanese occupation era. In order to replenish his insufficient troop strength, the bandit Fu is frantically conscripting soldiers and laborers. Any young man over the age of eighteen is in constant danger of being seized. Wealthy people mostly buy replacements, and the market price for a replacement soldier has risen to 12 million yuan. At the airport, the Xishanpo railway station, and important intersections, hundreds of citizens are seized every day to build fortifications and bunkers. Citizens are fleeing en masse. Zhangjiakou, which had a population of 200,000 when it was liberated by us, now has fewer than 120,000. The streets are deserted, and pedestrians are scarce. The once prosperous Nanbei Wucheng Street area is now completely unrecognizable. This frontier city is now filled with brothels, patrons, and special agents. After enduring the bloody rule of the "Second Mengjiang," the people are raising their heads in sorrow and indignation, eagerly awaiting the People's Liberation Army to fight back and liberate them from the abyss of suffering.

    傅作义“二蒙疆”统治下
    张家口成人间地狱
    【新华社晋察冀三日电】张家口讯：傅作义蹂躏下的张家口，已被人民称为“二蒙疆”（按“蒙疆”指日寇与汉（蒙）奸在察绥之统治）。数月来频频检查户口，突然戒严，一夕数惊，已成家常便饭。宪兵警察到处横行，见老百姓稍不顺眼即拳足交加，痛打后还不准哼一声。傅贼在张垣设有大集中营，对外美其名曰“张垣绥靖公署青年训导大队”，仅嫌疑犯大队即囚青年五百人。傅贼并遣派特务监视市民行动，如发现有人经常阅读街头贴报，即秘密跟踪，并诘问其为什么如此关心时事，答复稍一不合胃口即遭逮捕。苛捐杂税之繁重尤甚于日寇统治时代，因之商业萧条，商店纷纷歇业，小贩则多以贩卖美货糊口。物价飞涨，六月份小米每斤即售至二千八百元，麻油每斤八千元，盐每斤五千六百元。工厂大批倒闭，工人失业无法生活，市民生活重又被投入日寇统治时代的苦海中。傅贼为补充其兵力不足，正疯狂抓丁抓夫，凡年在十八岁以上的青壮年，随时均有被抓危险，富人多买丁顶替，壮丁市价已涨至一千二百万元一名。飞机场、西山坡火车站及重要路口，每天均有市民数百人被抓在此修筑工事堡垒，市民纷纷逃亡，在我解放时人口达二十万的张家口，现已不足十二万。街头冷落，行人稀少，过去繁盛的南北武城街一带，今日已面目全非。这塞上都市现在多的是妓院，是嫖客，是特务，人民饱受“二蒙疆”的血腥统治后，在悲愤中抬起头来，正盼望着人民解放军打回去，把他们从水深火热中解放出来。
