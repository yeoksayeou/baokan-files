    Indonesia's War of Independence
    On July 10th, Dutch imperialists launched a new war of aggression against Indonesia without a declaration of war. On the same day at midnight, Dutch imperialists arrested Indonesian representatives, thus breaking off the negotiations between the Netherlands and Indonesia that had lasted for a year and a half. The ceasefire agreement between the Netherlands and Indonesia signed on October 14th of last year, and the Linggadjati Agreement reached on November 15th of last year and formally signed on March 25th of this year, were all torn up by Dutch imperialists. In the face of the Dutch imperialists' offensive, the people of Indonesia bravely rose up and, under the leadership of the Indonesian government, are conducting a glorious war of resistance for national independence.
    Indonesia has been subjected to Dutch imperialist aggression for 350 years, making it one of the earliest colonies in the world. The 70 million people of Indonesia have waged heroic struggles against Dutch imperialist enslavement. After the First World War, under the leadership of the Indonesian Communist Party, the Indonesian people once launched a large-scale uprising, which was brutally suppressed by Dutch imperialists with bloody means. With the outbreak of the Pacific War, Dutch troops fled at the sight of Japanese fascists, and Indonesia was reduced to a Japanese colony. The Indonesian people then turned to fighting against Japan. In August of the year before last, the Japanese bandits surrendered, and the Republic of Indonesia declared its independence, which is exactly two years ago now.
    During these two years, because Dutch imperialists, with the help of British and American imperialists, attempted to restore their old sinful rule, the Indonesian people had to continue to fight for national independence. This struggle began when the troops of the Netherlands and Britain set foot on Indonesian soil. Dutch imperialists once hoped to achieve the goal of re-conquering Indonesia by means of war. However, in carrying out this war of aggression, Dutch imperialists found themselves facing serious difficulties: First, the Netherlands, after being ravaged by German fascists, was economically unable to support this war of aggression, and the Dutch people rose up to oppose the Dutch government treating Indonesia as Germany had treated the Netherlands; Second, the Dutch reactionaries relied on the help of British reactionaries, but the British reactionaries themselves were also facing numerous difficulties; Third, the opponent the Dutch reactionaries encountered was the armed Indonesian nation, whose slogan was "100% independence," which is an invincible force. These circumstances forced the Dutch government to engage in direct negotiations with Indonesia. Now, the facts have proven that the reason Dutch imperialists needed this negotiation was not out of a sincere desire to achieve peace, but merely to buy time in order to prepare for another offensive.
    During the negotiation process, the Indonesian people and government strived for peace and made significant concessions. The Linggadjati Agreement, formally signed in March of this year, recognized Indonesian independence. This agreement stipulated that Java, Madura, and Sumatra would form the Republic of Indonesia, and that the Republic of Indonesia, Borneo, and the Great East (including the eastern half of New Guinea and the Celebes Islands) would form the United States of Indonesia. The constitution of the United States would be decided by a constitutional assembly, and the United States would be a member of the Netherlands-Indonesia Union. The agreement also stipulated that the areas of the Republic of Indonesia occupied by Allied or Dutch forces must be incorporated into the territory of the Republic of Indonesia no later than January 1, 1949.
    However, just in February of this year, British troops withdrew from Indonesia, and a large number of Dutch reinforcements had already arrived. The work of Dutch troops taking over the defense from British troops was basically completed. At the same time, discussions between the Netherlands and the United States regarding the issue of armaments were also close to being resolved. This means that the preparations for Dutch imperialists to re-launch a war of aggression were almost complete. Therefore, the Dutch side sought a pretext to launch a new offensive, which was to "revise" the Linggadjati Agreement. Dutch imperialists, on the one hand, instigated separatist movements in the United States of Indonesia, such as in the Moluccas Islands, and on the other hand, put forward a "revision plan" for the Linggadjati Agreement, demanding the organization of a "joint gendarmerie," in other words, to continue stationing troops in Indonesia, thereby canceling Indonesian independence. On May 27th, Dutch imperialists issued an ultimatum to Indonesia, but the Indonesian government still made every last effort to strive for peace. On July 6th, Indonesia's reply to the Netherlands made new concessions, basically accepting the construction of "organizing a federal government." On July 20th, Indonesia even requested that the International Court of Justice in The Hague step in to arbitrate. But all these concessions were in vain. This time, with the assistance of the reactionaries of the United States and Britain, Dutch imperialists launched an offensive on this very day, July 20th. The Dutch invading army has a force of 100,000, all trained and equipped by the United Kingdom and the United States. The United States and Britain also supply the Dutch invading army with weapons and materials, many of which are now being transported from the United States and Britain to the Indonesian battlefield.
    The course of events proves conclusively that what the Dutch imperialists are carrying out is a war of aggression, while what the Indonesian people and their government are carrying out is a just war of independence.
    In this war, Dutch imperialism is even more outwardly strong but inwardly weak. Due to the Netherlands' poor economic situation, it must rely on British, and especially American, aid to carry out this war of aggression. However, on the Indonesian side, its strength has been strengthened due to the land reform carried out over the past two years, the development of industry, and the formation of a 140,000-strong People's Army. This war particularly demonstrates that Dutch imperialism is increasingly becoming isolated and unpopular. The sympathy of the whole world is on the Indonesian side. Dutch workers, Australian workers, British workers, India and Pakistan, and the people of all countries have risen up to support Indonesia. The war has only been going on for a little over ten days, but the Dutch invading army has already begun to taste the blows of the Indonesian people in areas such as Semarang and Bandung. It can be predicted that as long as Indonesia unswervingly adheres to the correct policy of internal unity and resistance against the enemy, final victory will surely belong to Indonesia.
    Chiang Kai-shek's government, a running dog of American imperialism, fully demonstrated its running dog nature after Dutch imperialists launched their war of aggression. At a time when the world is sympathizing with Indonesia and condemning the Netherlands, not only did he fail to make any expression of justice, but he instead took advantage of the fire to rob Indonesia under the pretext of the property losses of overseas Chinese in the war. This reactionary behavior of Chiang Kai-shek's government does not receive the sympathy of the Chinese people and overseas Chinese at all, because all the losses of overseas Chinese were caused by the Dutch's breach of contract and attack on Indonesia, which forced them to resist. The invading Dutch imperialists should bear full responsibility. The sympathy of the Chinese people is entirely on the side of the Indonesian people and the Indonesian government who are fighting for national independence.
    The hope of the Chinese people is that the Indonesian people and the Indonesian government should persevere in the war of independence they are waging until victory. For this purpose, it is necessary to strengthen the unity among the various ethnic groups in Indonesia and the unity among the various democratic parties and democratic groups, to oppose the common enemy Dutch imperialists and Anglo-American reactionaries; to resolutely oppose all vacillating elements, to guarantee national independence; the leadership of the war should be in the hands of the most resolute leaders, and continue to develop various necessary political and economic reforms, in order to mobilize the strength of the broad masses of the people, overcome all difficulties, and persevere in long-term and arduous struggle, to achieve the complete realization of Indonesian national liberation. On this second anniversary of Indonesia's declaration of independence, we express to the Indonesian people and government the Chinese people's infinite sympathy for them, and wish the great victory of the national liberation of the 70 million people of Indonesia.

### 印度尼西亚的独立战争

    印度尼西亚的独立战争
    七月一十日，荷兰帝国主义者对印度尼西亚不宣而战，发动了新的侵略战争，同日午夜荷兰帝国主义者逮捕了印尼代表，进行了一年半之久的荷兰与印尼的谈判因此破裂；去年十月十四日签订的荷兰与印尼的休战协定，及去年十一月十五日取得协议并于今年三月二十五日正式签订的林牙椰蒂协定，都被荷兰帝国主义者一手撕毁了。在荷兰帝国主义者进攻的面前，印度尼西亚人民勇敢的起来，在印尼政府领导下为民族的独立进行光荣的抗战。
    印度尼西亚受荷兰帝国主义的侵略已经三百五十年，这是世界上最早的殖民地之一，印尼七千万人民为了反对荷兰帝国主义的奴役，曾作了英勇的斗争：第一次世界大战后，在印尼共产党领导之下，印尼人民曾一度爆发大规模的起义；这个起义曾被荷兰帝国主义者以血腥的手段，残暴的镇压下去。太平洋战争爆发，荷兰军队在日本法西斯的面前望风而逃，印尼一度沦为日本的殖民地，印尼人民转而进行抗日斗争。前年八月日寇投降，印尼共和国宣布独立，到现在恰恰两周年了。
    在这两年之中，由于荷兰帝国主义者在英国和美国两个帝国主义的帮助之下，企图恢复其旧日的罪恶统治，因此印尼人民不得不为民族独立继续奋斗，这个斗争从荷英两国的军队踏上印尼土地的时候就开始了。荷兰帝国主义者曾经希望以战争的手段来达到再度征服印尼的目的；但是在进行这个侵略战争的时候，荷兰帝国主义者发现了自己面临着严重的困难：第一，荷兰受了德国法西斯的蹂躏之后，经济上无法支持这个侵略战争，荷兰人民则起来反对荷兰政府以德国对待荷兰的行为对待印尼；第二，荷兰反动派依赖英国反动派的帮助，但是英国反动派自己亦困难重重；第三，荷兰反动派所遇到的对手是已经武装起来的印尼民族，他们的口号是“百分之百的独立”，这是一个不可战胜的力量。这些情况使荷兰政府被迫与印尼进行直接谈判；现在事实已经证明，荷兰帝国主义者所以需要这个谈判，并非诚心要获致和平，仅仅是为了争取时间，以便准备再度进攻。
    在谈判过程中，印尼人民与政府力图争取和平，作了重大的让步。今年三月正式签字的林牙椰蒂协定，承认了印尼独立。这个协定规定以爪哇、马都拉、和苏门答腊组成印尼共和国，由印尼共和国、波罗洲及大东（包括新几内亚东半部及西里伯斯诸岛）组成印尼合众国，合众国由立宪大会决定宪法，合众国为荷兰印尼联合国之成员；协定中又规定盟军或荷军占领的印尼共和国区域，至迟须于一九四九年一月一日以前并入印尼共和国领土内。
    可是，就在今年二月间，英军从印尼撤退，大量荷兰援军已经开到，荷军接替英军的防务的工作已基本上完成；同时，荷兰与美国关于军火问题的商讨也接近于解决；这就是说，荷兰帝国主义者重新发动侵略战争的准备工作已经快要完成，于是荷兰方面就寻找发动新进攻的借口，这个借口就是要“修改”林牙椰蒂协定。荷兰帝国主义者一方面策动印尼合众国中的异太岛等的分裂运动，一方面提出对于林牙椰蒂协定的“修改方案”，要组织“联合宪兵队”，换句话说就是要继续驻兵于印尼，由此来取消印尼的独立。五月二十七日，荷兰帝国主义者对印尼发出了哀的美敦书，但印尼政府仍尽最后努力来争取和平。七月六日印尼致荷兰的复文作了新的让步，基本上接受“组织联邦政府”的建设；七月二十日印尼还要求由海牙国际法庭出面仲裁；但这一切让步都是徒然、荷兰帝国主义者这一次在美英两国反动派的援助之下，就在七月二十日这一天发动了进攻。荷兰侵略军的兵力十万人，都是由英国和美国训练与装备的，美国和英国并供给荷兰侵略军以武器和物资，其中许多现在正由美英各地运向印尼战场上去。
    事实的经过，确切无疑的证明了荷兰帝国主义者所进行的是侵略战争，而荷印人民与其政府所进行的是正义的独立战争。
    在这次战争中，荷兰帝国主义者是更加外强中干；由于荷兰经济状况的恶劣，它必须依赖英国的尤其是美国的援助来进行此次侵略战争。但是印尼方面由于两年来进行了土地改革，发展了工业和组成了十四万人民军，它的力量就加强了。这次战争特别表现出荷兰帝国主义者日益走向众叛亲离，全世界的同情是在印尼方面，荷兰工人、澳洲工人、英国工人、印度与巴基斯坦以及各国人民都起来声援印尼。战争仅仅爆发了十几天，但荷兰侵略军已经开始在三宝垅、万隆等地区尝到印尼人民打击的滋味。可以预卜，只要印尼毫不动摇的坚持对内团结、对敌抗战的正确方针，最后的胜利一定是属于印尼的。
    美国帝国主义的走狗蒋介石政府，在荷兰帝国主义发动侵略战争后，充分表现了他的走狗面目。在举世同情印尼斥责荷兰的时候，他不但毫无一点正义表示，反而借口华侨在战争中的财产损失，向印尼趁火打劫。蒋介石政府的此种反动行为完全得不到中国人民与华侨的同情，因为华侨的一切损失由荷兰违约进攻印尼被迫抵抗所引起的，应由侵略者荷兰帝国主义负完全的责任，中国人民的同情是完全在为民族独立而奋斗的印尼人民与印尼政府方面。
    中国人民的希望是：印尼人民与印尼政府应该把他们所进行的独立战争坚持到底，直到胜利；为此目的，必须加强印尼各民族间的团结和各民主党派、民主团体之间的团结，来反对共同敌人荷兰帝国主义者与英美反动派；应该坚决反对一切动摇分子，来保证民族独立；战争的领导权应掌握在最坚决的领导者之手，并继续发展各种必要的政治经济改革，以便动员广大人民的力量，克服一切困难，坚持长期艰苦的奋斗，来达到印尼民族解放的彻底实现。我们于此印尼宣布独立的二周年，向印尼人民与政府表示中国人民对他们的无限同情，并预祝印尼七千万人民的民族解放的伟大胜利。
        （八月六日）
