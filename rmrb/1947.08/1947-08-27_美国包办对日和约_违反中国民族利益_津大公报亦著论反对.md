Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 25th. According to a United Press dispatch from Peiping on the 22nd: The Tianjin Ta Kung Pao, in its editorial, expressed opposition to the United States' unilateral orchestration of a peace treaty with Japan. The editorial stated that if the Soviet Union does not participate in the conference, the treaty "will not solve any Far Eastern problems." "On the contrary, it will allow Japan to take advantage of discord among the Allies and place China in a difficult situation." The newspaper pointed out: "To be hostile to the Soviet Union and friendly to Japan is a violation of Chinese national interests." It advocated that China should resist the meeting proposed by the United States to draft a Japanese peace treaty if the Soviet Union does not participate. It pointed out that maintaining the veto power is the only way to prevent the resurgence of Japanese industrial aggression, and disapproved of the Chiang government's attempt to echo the United States' abolition of the veto power, saying: For example, if Britain and the United States agree to develop the Japanese textile industry, if the veto power cannot be exercised, "China will be sacrificed." The editorial stated that, in addition to realistic considerations, it would also be "regrettable" morally if a treaty were signed without Soviet participation; because in 1942 the Allies guaranteed not to make a separate peace with Japan.

　　美国包办对日和约　违反中国民族利益
  　津大公报亦著论反对
    【新华社陕北二十五日电】据合众社北平二十二日消息：天津大公报在其社评中，对美国单独包办对日和约一事表示反对。社论说：如果苏联不参加该项会议，则和约“将不能解决什么远东问题”。“相反地，将使日本能够利用盟国间的不和，并将中国置于困难境地。”该报指出：“如与苏联为敌，而与日本为友，这是违反中国民族利益的。”主张在苏联不参加情形下，中国应抵制美国所倡议的草拟日本和约的会议。指出保持否决权是防止复兴日本工业侵略的唯一办法，不赞成蒋政府附和美国取消否决权的企图，说：例如英美赞成发展日本纺织工业，如不能行使否决权，“中国即将被牺牲。”社评称：除了现实主义的考虑以外，如无苏联参加而签订和约，在道义上亦为“遗憾”；因为一九四二年盟国即保证不与日本单独媾和。
