　　【Report from Li Cheng by this Newspaper】After North Liu Village continuously rushed to sow and replant to eliminate barren land, in order to achieve intensive cultivation and increase grain production, the whole village was planning the next stage of life. Li Jiajun said: "After sowing is completed, we should grasp weeding tightly. For example, Liu Juntian's peanut field by the river in my team, he wouldn't even need one work-day if he weeded it earlier; because after this rain, the grass and peanut plants are all connected! One mu (Chinese acre) would be delayed by four work-days." Li Renhu said: "The seedlings got rain, and the grass also stretched its legs. If we don't weed it in time, the seedlings and grass will become one, and the delay will not be worth it." Labor heroes Li Choudu said: "If we want to finish weeding quickly, so that the seedlings are not damaged by weeds, we have to organize all the labor in the village and divide the work specifically to catch up." The leadership adapted to everyone's requirements and immediately convened a mass meeting, held group discussions, calculated accurately, and specifically made a weeding plan. In order to make the rushing of weeding timely, it was proposed that no large-scale meetings would be held for seven days, and all efforts would be devoted to participating in weeding. Production committee cadres are responsible for dividing the work and grasping the leadership. Team leaders report weeding techniques, experiences, and achievements to the production brigade leader at any time in their spare time, and commend and promote them on the radio in a timely manner to inspire everyone's enthusiasm. According to the specific division of labor between men, women, full and part-time labor, and auxiliary labor, the plan is as follows: 1. Cotton is to be completed by women and male part-time labor. The whole village has a total of 631.4 mu of cotton. The first weeding is 205 mu, the second weeding is 324 mu, and the third weeding is 101.7 mu. The cotton will be weeded three times on average within ten days, requiring a total of 734 work-days. There are 40 women in the village who can go to the fields to weed cotton, and 73 male part-time laborers (one male part-time laborer equals one female worker). Each work-day can weed an average of 0.65 mu of cotton, and it can all be weeded within seven days. When women go to the fields, the organization of labor exchange is mainly work exchange. Weeding cotton for one day exchanges for five liang of first-class thread or six liang of second-class thread, or three jin of rice (without meals). Women's part-time labor and old men and children are responsible for repairing cotton (removing cotton leaves and topping). 2. Peanuts and millet will be weeded twice on average within ten days, corn will be weeded three times on average, and beans will be weeded once. Each work-day can weed an average of one mu, requiring a total of 1,227 work-days. There are 166 male laborers in the village, and they can finish weeding within eight days.

    【Report from Taiyue by this Newspaper, 11th】Under the call to strive for an 80% harvest, various places have launched intensive weeding campaigns. The original plan was to weed twice, but now it has been changed to three or four times. The Shizhenming joint brigade of labor hero in Fushan has completed three rounds of intensive weeding on more than 7,000 mu of millet land. The Wang Sanguan brigade of labor hero in Qinyuan, under the mobilization of "kicking the seedlings at the beginning of the hot season is better than adding fertilizer", has completed the third weeding. The Zhang Jiuming mutual aid brigade in Qinshui strives for intensive cultivation. The second weeding of autumn seedlings has been completely completed, and the third weeding has begun. Most of the crops have already emerged and are growing very lushly. The millet is about three feet tall, and the corn is four or five feet tall. The two women's groups led by female labor hero Zheng Yueying in Anze Lancun actively participated in weeding, and proposed that the fast ones should teach the slow ones. Within five days, they weeded 22 mu of millet, 8 mu of corn, 7 mu of sorghum, and pulled 18 mu of corn seedlings. In Yangyao Village, Yangcheng, all male, female, full and part-time laborers and children participated in weeding, and rushed to weed 1,100 mu of replanted autumn seedlings in four days. The Hao Changgui mutual aid group in Zhangxun Village weeded the millet three times, and also weeded the late autumn crops once. The plan for weeding millet three times in Gaoping Saisheng and Dajiechuan has been fully realized, and the cotton has been weeded seven times, and even eight or nine times.
    【Report from Pingshun by this Newspaper】In order to increase production, the Fifth District advocates early and more weeding. More than 500 mu of millet have been weeded once, more than 10,000 mu have been weeded twice, more than 4,000 mu have been weeded three times, more than 5,000 mu of Jin Queen have been top-dressed with fertilizer, and more than 1,000 mu of cotton have been weeded five times. During the process, universal attention was paid to research on techniques. Beishe Village researched using sesame cake mixed with water to irrigate corn for drought resistance and top-dressing (because it is easy to burn if using only sesame cake in dry weather), so that it can both irrigate the seedlings and top-dress with fertilizer, and put forward slogans such as no fertilizer should be stored in every household, clean latrines, and clean fertilizer yards. Yangjingdi Village researched weeding techniques, not leaving millet seedlings close together, the hoe must reach every spot, the soil must be hoeed evenly, and the seedlings must be surrounded well to be airtight and drought-resistant. When the hoe reaches the roots of the millet, it is easy to collect fertilizer, and a water storage pool is built every three feet away, which can store water when it rains. After the rain, some villages had paralysis, complacency and other thoughts. After continuous and repeated ideological mobilization, the production increase movement can be implemented.

  　太岳各地开展细锄运动
    【本报黎城讯】北流村经常抢种补种消灭白地后，为了做到精耕细作增产粮食，全村酝酿下一段生活，李甲军说：“眼前下完种应抓紧锄苗，如我组刘俊田河滩有一亩落花生，他要早锄还不用一个工哩；因下了这场雨草与落花生都连成一片啦！一亩就误了四个工”。李仁虎说：“小苗得了雨，草也伸开腿，如不及时锄，苗草连成蛋，误工就不合算啦”。劳英李丑犊说：“咱要想快些锄完，使苗儿不受荒，总得把全村劳力组织起来具体分工才赶的来”。领导上适应大家要求，当即召集了群众会，分组讨论，精确计算，具体订出锄苗计划。为使抢锄及时，提出七天不开大会，全力参加锄苗。生产委员会干部负责分工抓紧领导，小组长抽空隙随时向生产大队长汇报锄苗技术经验成绩，在广播台上及时表扬与推广，来鼓舞大家情绪。根据男女全半及辅助劳力具体分工，计划如下：一、棉花由妇女男半劳力完成，全村计有棉花六百三十一亩四，头一锄二百零五亩，二锄三百二十四亩，三锄一百零一亩七，在十天内棉花平均锄完三遍，共需工七百三十四个。全村妇女能上地锄棉者四十个，男半劳力七十三个（男半劳力顶女工一个），每工平均锄棉六分五，七天内可全部锄完。妇女上地与组织变工主要是工变工，锄一天棉花纺头等线五两、二等线六两，不变工出米三斤（不吃饭）。妇女半劳力与老汉儿童负责修理棉花（脱裤打顶除油条）。二、十天内花生、谷平均锄两遍，玉茭平均锄三遍，豆锄一遍，每工平均锄一亩，共需工一千二百二十七个，全村有男劳力一百六十六个，八天内可锄完。（北流村通讯组）
    【本报太岳十一日电】在争取八成收的号召下，各地纷纷展开细锄运动，原计划锄两遍的，现改作三遍、四遍。浮山劳动英雄石振明联合大队，七千余亩谷地，已突击锄完三遍。沁源劳动英雄王三官大队，在“入伏踢一脚，赛如加篓油”的动员之下，已锄完第三遍。沁水张九铭互助大队，力求精耕细作，现秋苗二遍完全锄完，三遍已动锄，庄稼大部已莠出穗来，十分茂盛。谷高三尺左右，玉茭四五尺。安泽兰村女劳动英雄郑月英领导的两个妇女组，积极参加锄苗，并提出快的要教慢的，五天内就锄了谷子二十二亩，玉茭八亩，高粱七亩，拔玉茭苗十八亩。阳城杨腰村男女全半劳力及儿童全部参加锄苗，四天突击锄完回茬秋苗一千一亩。章训村郝昌贵互助组，除谷子锄了三遍，又把晚秋锄过头遍。高平赛上及大野川，谷锄三遍的计划，已完全实现，并将棉花锄过七遍，甚至有锄八遍、九遍的。
    【本报平顺讯】五区为了增产，提倡早锄多锄。谷锄一遍的五百余亩，二遍一万余亩，三遍四千余亩，金皇后上追肥五千余亩，棉花锄过五遍的有一千余亩。进行中普遍注意了研究技术，北社村研究抗旱上追肥用麻饼掺水浇玉茭（因光用麻饼天旱发烧），这样既能浇苗又能上追肥，并提出家家不存肥、茅坑净、肥场净等口号。羊井底村研究锄苗技术，不留对安谷，锄头要走到，土要锄匀和，苗子要围好不透风能抗旱。锄头走到谷根，易收肥料，每三尺远搂一蓄水池，下雨能存下水。落雨后有些村有麻痹自满等思想，经继续反复思想动员，才能贯彻增产运动。
