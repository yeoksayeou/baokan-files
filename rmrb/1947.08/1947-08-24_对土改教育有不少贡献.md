Contributed Significantly to Land Reform Education

[This Newspaper] The "New Masses" magazine, published by Xinhua Bookstore, has focused its editorial efforts on researching and reflecting the land reform movement since last year. Almost every issue contains answers to many confusing ideas in land reform, including the article "How is Thorough Struggle Defined?", which was reprinted in this newspaper. In its recently published issues 40 and 41, there are more articles of this kind. According to general readers, these texts, as well as many other stories, correspondence, and problem studies in the land reform movement, have greatly promoted practical work and ideological education. In addition, the "New Masses Series" edited and printed by the agency, specifically the eighth ("Yuanjiawa Crushes False Struggle") and ninth ("Masses Remold Cadres") issues, are even more suitable for today's review movement and solving the relationship between cadres and the masses, and almost every cadre in the county and district has a copy.

  　对土改教育有不少贡献
    【本报讯】新华书店出版之“新大众”杂志，自去年以来，即以研究并反映土地改革运动为编辑中心。差不多每期都有对土改中许多糊涂思想的解答文字，其中“斗争怎样才算彻底”一文，并经本报转载过。在其最近出版之四十、四十一两期中，又有此类文章发表。据一般读者反映，这些文字以及其他许多土改运动中的故事、通信、问题研究等，均对实际工作及思想教育起了很大的推动作用。又该社编印之“新大众丛刊”，其第八（袁家洼打垮假斗争）、第九（群众改造干部）两种，更适合于今天复查运动及解决干群关系的需要，差不多在县区干部中已做到人手一册。（子宣）
