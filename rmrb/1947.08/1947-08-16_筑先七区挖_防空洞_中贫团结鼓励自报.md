Zhuxian Seventh District Digs "Air Raid Shelters"
Middle and Poor Peasants Unite, Encouraging Self-Reporting

[This newspaper, Ji Lu Yu, 14th dispatch] On the 27th of last month, the Zhuxian Seventh District held a peasant congress, attended by more than 2,000 people. First, the district instructor conveyed that the basic spirit of the re-examination was to thoroughly investigate the landlords. Then, the middle and poor peasants separately brewed "pouring out bitterness." Why hasn't the poor peasantry been thoroughly emancipated? Why are middle peasants afraid, and why are they not active? During the discussion, it was clarified that it was because the landlords had not been eliminated. Under the unified understanding of "all sins belong to the landlord, facing the landlord," both sides elected representatives and mutually vowed to unite for re-examination. The next day, the leadership called for "self-reporting is the most glorious" and "self-reporting is meritorious." Advanced individuals took the lead. More than 320 people reported the clothes, grain, furniture, etc., stored by the landlords. Many people were given flowers and wine after self-reporting, and their merits were recorded. The enthusiasm of the masses and class consciousness were raised to an unprecedented level. Some people self-reported two or three times, combining self-reporting with accusations. Zhang Zizhen, the old peasant association chairman of Yangji, said: "In the 29th year of the Republic of China [1940], my brother Zhang Zijie and Zhao Chunhua, Zhao Chunzhou established a peasant mutual aid society in the village. The landlords Zhai Wen'an and Zhai Dongzhen colluded with the traitorous gendarmerie, and drove cars to arrest more than 70 old and young men and women in our village. Everything was looted, and the crimes people suffered in the traitorous army were indescribable! My brother was murdered, and seven or eight people are still missing." Then, Yan Yuming from Daiqiao, accused the landlord Ma Hongqing of colluding with the traitorous Third Detachment; Wang from Xie Temple accused the landlord and murderer Wang Jinming, and unanimously demanded revenge for the dead. Next, regarding the issue of poor and rich villages, everyone developed and resolved the letting the poor compete, automatically helping small villages. Yan Yuqing, the agricultural association chairman of Daiqiao, first said: "Our village will send a large cart, an ox, and a stone trough to Wanglou." After the meeting, the cart, ox, stone trough, etc., were sent to Wanglou. Under the slogan of "Poor people all over the world are one family," the people who attended the meeting were determined to go back and widely carry out the meritorious self-reporting movement, so that poor brothers could be emancipated together.
