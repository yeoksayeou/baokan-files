Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 28th. Comprehensive reports: Following the successful purge of reactionaries and the reorganization of the government last month, Hungary has enthusiastically launched a nationwide campaign for the National Assembly general election scheduled for August 31. In this election, Hungary will establish a permanent unicameral parliament to replace the original provisional parliament. The provisional parliament was dissolved on the 25th. The new election law, agreed upon by various democratic parties, is a revision of the 1945 election law. The main points of the revision are the cancellation of the right to vote for members who previously participated in Hungarian fascist organizations, and a slight reduction in the number of parliamentarians. The new election law guarantees the universal and democratic suffrage of citizens nationwide, stipulating that all male and female citizens over the age of 20 have the right to vote. Various parties have now begun active election campaigns. The workers' parties, the Communist Party and the Social Democratic Party, are planning to help each other in the election. Rakosi, General Secretary of the Hungarian Communist Party, gave an election speech at a mass rally a few days ago, calling on "all parties to work together to fight the common enemy, the reactionaries," and pointed out that this election "allows voters to make better choices." The Smallholders Party decided to run independently, to maintain private property and to support the main program of an independent, free, and democratic Hungary. The former General Secretary of the party, Balogh István, recently formed the Hungarian Independent Democratic Party to participate in the election. The Liberal Party, a far-right opposition party led by Szüllő, had to announce its self-dissolution on the 22nd because most of its members were former fascists deprived of the right to vote, but at the same time, it was actively engaged in activities against democratic elections.

    匈牙利月底大选
    取消法西斯分子选举权
    【新华社陕北二十八日电】综合报导：匈牙利继上月胜利的肃清反动分子改组政府后，全国又热烈的展开定于八月卅一日举行的国民议会的大选运动，在此次选举中匈牙利将成立永久的一院制的议会，以代替原来的临时议会。临时议会已于二十五日宣布解散。由各民主党派协议的新选举法，系根据一九四五年的选举法所修订。修改要点在取消以前参加匈牙利法西斯组织分子之选举权，议员人数也略有减少。新选举法保证全国公民普遍民主的选举权，规定凡二十岁以上的男女公民都有选举权。各党派现已开始积极的竞选运动。工人阶级政党的共产党与社会民主党正计划在竞选中互助。匈共总书记拉科西日前在群众大会上发表竞选演说，号召“各党齐力与共同敌人反动派作战”，并指出：这次选举“使选举人得到更好的选择”。小农党决定单独竞选，以维持私有财产及赞成独立、自由、民主的匈牙利主要纲领。该党前任总书记巴洛格。伊茨凡则在最近另组匈牙利独立民主党，准备参加竞选。由苏略克领导的极右翼反对派政党的自由党，因为党员大多数是被剥夺选举权的前法西斯分子，一面不得不在二十二日宣布自行解散，一面却极力进行反对民主选举的活动。
