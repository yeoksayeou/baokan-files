What to do when vegetables have bugs?
    ·Xi Fengzhou·
    In the current emergency movement to prepare for famine, many autumn vegetables have been replanted in various places, mostly radishes, turnips, kohlrabi, and cabbage. According to past experience, these kinds of vegetables are most prone to insect pests. In order to ensure that yields are not lost due to insect pests, we must first pay extra attention to various vegetable insects, and prepare early before the insects occur. After they occur, we must organize the masses to eliminate them.
    Now I will introduce the vegetable insects that are most likely to occur on several kinds of vegetables and their treatment methods:
    Leaf Beetle - There is a black-blue hard-shelled beetle, about the size of a small bean. Its mouth is very fierce. In a few days, it can eat the vegetable leaves badly, and it eats cabbage leaves even faster. Control methods: (1) Capture: This insect shrinks its legs and pretends to be dead when the vegetable plant shakes. At this time, quickly grab it with your hands and put it in a basin of water, and then kill it with medicine. (2) Mud sticking method: Fill a basin with very thick mud water. While the insect is pretending to be dead, use a thin wooden stick dipped in mud to stick the insect, stick it in the mud basin, and the insect will not be able to escape, and then kill them in groups. This method is very effective. When this insect first occurs, it can be quickly eliminated as long as manpower is organized. (3) Break the insect eggs: This insect can lay eggs twice a year, the first time around April and the second time around August. Each female insect can lay 500 eggs. The eggs are light yellow or orange-yellow, very small, and mostly laid on vegetable leaves. When you see them, quickly crush them with your hands to prevent them from reproducing. (4) Kill larvae: The larvae of this insect are black and small. They also eat vegetable leaves quickly. It is also effective to grind the bark of the bitter tree, the seeds of the Ailanthus tree, and tobacco leaves (or tobacco leaf stems) into fine powder and sprinkle them on the vegetable leaves with some firewood ash. If red alum is mixed with firewood ash to treat it, the effect will be even greater.
    Cabbage Worm - There is a green soft-bodied insect, which is the larva of the cabbage white butterfly. It can climb on vegetables and harm them. Control methods: (1) Grind tobacco stalks or tobacco leaves into fine powder, mix them with some firewood ash, and sprinkle them on the vegetable leaves with a fine sieve in the early morning when the dew has not dried. (2) Grind the bark of the bitter tree, the root bark of the star fruit tree, or the seeds of the Ailanthus tree into fine powder and sprinkle them on the vegetable leaves. (3) Catch them by hand when they first occur.
    Cabbage Aphid - Commonly known as "oil drought," it is a very small green pest that specializes in sucking the nutrients from vegetables. After sucking, the vegetable leaves turn white and soon wither. Control methods: (1) Soak one catty of tobacco leaves in twenty-four catties of water. After a day and a night, use the water to spray. For urgent use, you can add fire to boil it for half an hour to an hour. (2) Grind tobacco, Ailanthus seeds, bitter tree bark, and star fruit root bark into fine powder and sprinkle them on the vegetable leaves. (3) Use cottonseed oil to treat it. When preparing, first melt half a catty of soap and one catty of water over a fire, then slowly pour in four taels of cottonseed oil, stirring while pouring. After the oil is poured in, stir for another ten minutes to form a milky cottonseed oil emulsion. When using, add forty-nine catties of water and mix quickly before spraying. If the area affected by cabbage aphids is small, you can prepare less medicine. (4) It is also effective to boil chili peppers into water for treatment. (5) Ants often protect vegetable leaf insects because they like to eat the honeydew excreted by the vegetable insects. This requires driving away the ants and destroying the ant nests.
    Flea Beetle - This insect is rare. The adult insect is black and the larva is light yellow. The hind legs are developed and can jump, harming radishes, turnips, and cabbage. Control methods: (1) When the vegetable leaves first show signs of insects, sprinkle tobacco leaf powder mixed with some firewood ash at any time to avoid eating the initial seedlings. (2) When this insect occurs too much, use a very wide wooden board with a layer of glue or other sticky things on it, place it on one side of the vegetable garden, and drive the insects from the other side. The insects will jump onto the mud board and get stuck.
    Cutworm - Cutworm, also known as "ground tiger" or "earth silkworm," specializes in eating the roots of vegetables. Control methods: (1) Crush almond cakes, hemp cakes, or Ailanthus seed cakes and apply them to the ground, using twenty to thirty catties per mu. Or use straws dipped in asphalt and insert them near the roots of vegetables to drive away this insect. (2) Check the fields every morning. If you see any vegetable plants that have been bitten off, dig open the soil around the roots and kill the insects hiding in the soil, so that they will not bite another vegetable plant. (3) If you can use red alum mixed with bran to bury it at the base of the roots to treat it, it will be even more effective. When treating the above five kinds of pests, you should also pay attention to two points: First, go to the fields frequently to check. As soon as you see insect pests occur, take action to treat them as early as possible. The later you treat them, the more insects will reproduce, and the damage will be greater. Second, collect more local medicines and local methods, because the masses in various places have very rich experience and methods for eliminating vegetable insects, which are both money-saving and practical!

　　菜上生虫怎样办？
    ·席凤洲·
    在目前紧急备荒运动中，各地补种的秋菜特别多，大部分是萝卜、芜菁、菜根、白菜等。据历年经验，这几种菜最容易闹虫害，为了保证产量不因虫害受损失，首先对于各种菜虫就需要加倍注意，在虫子未发生以前，就应及早准备，发生以后，更要组织群众除治。
    现在把几种菜最容易发生的菜虫和治法介绍于下：
    猿叶虫——有一种黑蓝色的硬壳虫，和小豆子差不多一般大，虫嘴很厉害，几天之中，就可以把菜叶吃坏，吃白菜叶更快。除治方法：（一）捕捉：此虫一见菜棵摇动，就缩腿装假死，这时就赶快用手捉住，放在水盆里，然后再药中杀死。（二）泥粘法：用盆装进很稠的泥水，趁虫装死时，用一种细木棒蘸泥去粘虫，粘住放在泥盆里，虫就跑不掉了，然后群杀死。这个方法很有效，刚发生此虫时，只要把人力组织起很快就可扑灭。（三）破虫卵：此虫一年能生两次，第一次在四月前后，第二次在八月前后，每一个母虫，能产卵五百粒，卵是淡黄色或橙黄色，非常小，多产在菜叶上，见到时，就赶快用手压破，不使再生虫。（四）杀幼虫：此虫的幼虫是黑色，体根小，吃菜叶也很快，可用苦树皮，椿树籽，烟叶（或烟叶茎）碾成细末，配些柴灰散到菜叶上也有效力。如有红矾配上柴灰去治效力更大。
    青虫——有一种青绿色的软体虫，是菜白蝶的幼虫，能爬在菜上为害，除治方法：（一）用烟草秆成烟草叶，研成细末掺些柴草灰，在清早露水没干时，用细箩撒到菜叶上。（二）用苦树皮、杨桃根皮或椿树籽碾成细末撒到菜叶上。（三）初发生时，用手去捉。
    菜蚜虫——俗称为油旱，是一种极小的绿色害虫，专吸菜中养料，吸后菜叶变白色，不久就枯死。除治方法：（一）用一斤烟叶，泡在二十四斤水里，经过一天一夜后，用水去喷治，为了急用，可加火去熬，半点钟至一点钟时间即可。（二）用烟草、椿树籽、苦树皮、洋桃根皮碾成细末撒到菜叶上。（三）用棉籽油去治，配时，先把肥皂半斤，水一斤加火化开，再用四两棉籽油慢慢倒入，随倒随搅，等油倒完，再搅十分钟，即成乳状的棉油乳剂，用时再加四十九斤水，并急速拌搅，就可喷撒，如菜蚜为害面积小，可以少配些药。（四）用辣椒熬成水去治，也有效力。（五）蚂蚁因好吃菜虫排泄的蜜糖，常保护菜叶虫，这就应该驱除蚂蚁和破坏蚂蚁窑。
    菜蚤——此虫很少，成虫是黑色，幼虫是淡黄色，后腿发达能跳，为害萝卜、芜菁，白菜。除治方治：（一）菜叶初发生虫时，用烟叶末配些柴草灰随时去撒，以免吃坏初苗。（二）此虫发生太多时，可用很宽的木板，上面抹一层胶泥或其他粘东西，放在菜园一面，从另一面赶虫，这虫就跳到泥板上粘住。
    切根虫——切根虫又称“地老虎”或“土蚕”，专吃菜类的根部，除治方法：（一）把杏仁饼、大麻饼或椿树籽饼，碾碎上到地里，每亩地二三十斤即可。或用谷草节棒沾上柏油插入菜类近根地方，即可驱逐此虫。（二）每天清早去地里检查，见有被咬断的菜棵，就把根旁四周的土刨开，把藏在土中的虫杀死，这样就不会再去咬另一菜棵了。（三）如果能用红矾配些麸皮，埋到根际去治，更有效力。以上五种害虫，在除治时还要注意两点：第一要勤到地里察看，一见虫害发生，就早些动手去治，治的越迟，虫繁殖越多，受损极大。第二，要多搜集土药品，土办法，因各地群众对于除治菜虫有很丰富的经验和办法，使用起来又省钱，又实际！
