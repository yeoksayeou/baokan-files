Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 4th. In order to cater to its American master's attempt to monopolize the peace treaty with Japan, the Chiang Kai-shek government has decided to participate in the preparatory meeting for the peace treaty with Japan, to be held in the United States by the United States alone and attended by eleven countries. According to an Associated Press dispatch from Nanjing on the 1st, the Chiang government has instructed its ambassador to the United States, Gu Weijun, to notify the US government of this intention. According to a Central News Agency report: On the same day, the US State Department also announced that it had received the Chiang government's reply on the issue of the peace conference with Japan. The Chiang government took the opportunity to make a big fuss about the voting order at the peace conference with Japan in order to win the favor of the United States. In its statement, the spokesman of Chiang Kai-shek's Ministry of Foreign Affairs repeatedly imitated the tone of its American master, saying: "China (referring to the Chiang government) firmly insists that the voting method can reject the use of veto power by the Soviet Union or any other country," and copied the US proposal on the voting procedure at the meeting when the Far Eastern Commission was established the year before last (that is, a majority vote of the eleven countries present and a three-quarters vote of the four powers would make the proposal valid) and sent it to the US State Department as the Chiang government's own "preliminary opinion." The Chiang government has now re-submitted the opinion, which the United States was forced to abandon at the time. According to the United Press, it is "to inquire about the opinions of American people." This means that Chiang Kai-shek, in order to show his loyalty to the American master and express his activeness on the issue, must first look at his master's face. The United States' unilateral convening of the preparatory meeting for the peace treaty with Japan is obviously to implement its consistent policy of supporting the Japanese aggressive forces and serving as the police force of US imperialism in the South. This move will endanger world peace and, first and foremost, threaten our country's survival. When the United States unilaterally proposed to convene the preparatory meeting for the peace treaty with Japan last month, the Soviet Union firmly opposed it, and the United Kingdom also requested postponement. Among the four countries, only Chiang Kai-shek's small court in China is willing to sell out the future destiny of the Chinese nation, obey the United States' orders, and attempt to use this to obtain the war capital from the United States for slaughtering the Chinese people in the civil war. However, Chiang Kai-shek, the traitor, is not qualified to represent China. The Chinese people firmly oppose and firmly do not recognize the validity of the Chiang Kai-shek government's opinions.

    关于对日和约问题
    蒋党献媚美国主子
    【新华社陕北四日电】蒋介石政府为迎合其美国主子包办对日和约企图，已决定参加美国单独决定在美召开由十一国参加之对日和约预备会议。据美联社南京一日消息，蒋政府已令其驻美大使顾维钧将此意通知美国政府。据中央社息：同日美国国务院亦宣布已接获蒋政府关于对日和会问题复文。蒋政府乘机在对日和会表决秩序问题上大作文章，以邀美国之欢宠。蒋介石外交部发言人在其声明中，一再模仿其美国主子口吻说：“中国（指蒋政府）坚主表决方式能拒绝苏联或任何其他一国使用否决权，”并将前年远东委员会成立时美国在会上所提表决程序（即出席十一国过半数通过及四强中四分之三票数通过，议案即得成立）之意见照抄一遍，送往美国国务院，作为蒋政府自己的“初步意见”。该意见系美国当时被迫放弃者，蒋政府此次重新提出，据合众社称：是“欲以此探询美国人士之意见。”意思就是说，蒋介石为了忠心拥戴美国主子表示自己在该问题上的积极性以前，先要看看主子的脸色。美国单独召集对日和约预备会一举，显为贯彻其一贯的扶植日本侵略势力再做必需之充当美帝国主义在南方的警力的政策，此举将危及世界和平，而首先是威胁我国的生存。当美国上月擅自单独提出召开对日和约预备会后，苏联曾予坚决反对，英国亦要求延期召集。四国中惟独中国的蒋介石小朝廷，才不惜出卖中国民族的未来命运，惟美国之命是从，妄图借此讨得美国给予屠杀中国人民的内战赌本。但是，蒋介石卖国贼决无资格代表中国，中国人民坚决反对并坚决不承认蒋介石政府意见的有效性。
