(Our newspaper's telegram from Southern Hebei on the 22nd) Li Shengzhuang in the fourth district of Qiuxian County has summarized that mutual aid in weeding seedlings saved 2,500 workdays. After the village finished weeding, the masses calculated and summarized the mutual aid. Labor hero Li Zhao'an said, "In the past, without mutual aid, cotton and sorghum in the whole village were weeded three times, and millet was weeded twice. After mutual aid, cotton was weeded five times and millet three times." Guo Ming continued, "Now the village has 75 fewer laborers than in the famine years. Not only are we farming the village's land, but we have also reclaimed 70 mu of wasteland in Yangshengzhuang and planted autumn seedlings." The village planted 800 mu of cotton, weeding each mu twice more, saving 1,600 workdays; 500 mu of millet, weeding once more, saving 550 workdays; and 350 mu of sorghum, weeding once more, saving 350 workdays, for a total savings of 2,500 workdays. Li Wenting used to weed at most 0.6 mu in half a day; now he weeds one mu. Li Cunze used to be very lazy and would get dizzy when working, always wanting to rest. Now he can not only keep up with the work but also earns more than ten work points. Last year, Lin Longniang asked someone to plant her land, and only received two sacks of grain. After mutual aid, she exchanged labor for weaving and also weeds the land in her spare time, only owing others eight work points. This year, the harvest is estimated to be enough to eat.

　　邱县李省庄
  　互助省工　多锄一遍
    【本报冀南二十二日电】邱县四区李省庄总结互助锄苗，省工两千五百个。该村锄苗结束后，群众算帐总结互助时，劳英李兆安说：“过去不互助，全村棉花、高粱锄三遍，谷子锄两遍，互助后棉花锄了五遍，谷子三遍。”郭明继续说：“现在全村劳力比灾荒年还少七十五个，不但种本村地，又在杨省庄开生荒七十亩，种上秋苗。”全村种花八百亩，每亩多锄二遍，省工一千六百个，谷子五百亩，多锄一遍省工五百五十个，高粱三百五十亩，多锄一遍，省工三百五十个，总计共省工两千五百个。李文亭过去一晌最多锄六分地，现在锄一亩。李存泽过去很懒，做活就头晕，光愿歇歇，现在不仅能跟上班，还得工票十多个。林龙娘去年叫人捎种地，仅落了两口袋粮食，互助后以纺织换工，空里也锄地，只欠别人工票八个，今年收成粮食估计满可够吃。
