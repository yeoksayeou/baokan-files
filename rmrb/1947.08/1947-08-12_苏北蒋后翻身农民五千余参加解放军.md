Xinhua News Agency, Central China, 10th: Over five thousand five hundred emancipated young people in Northern Jiangsu, previously under Chiang, enthusiastically joined the People's Liberation Army around the August 1st Army Day. Having personally suffered from the atrocities of the Chiang army, they are filled with revenge and the anger to completely defeat the Chiang army. When Shen Zenghe, a sixty-year-old man from Shuyang, sent his son to join the army, he earnestly exhorted him: "As long as you remember that our family obtained land and became emancipated, you must fight old Chiang well!"

Xinhua News Agency, Central China, 10th: "Men take up guns to protect their homes, women spin and weave to pass the time." The textile industry in Northern Jiangsu, previously under Chiang, continues to achieve significant development. According to statistics from four counties including Binhai and Fudong, a total of more than 94,000 bolts of homespun cloth and more than 35,000 catties of foreign cloth have been woven in the eighteen months since last spring. Textile households have earned 7 million catties of work grain, enough to feed 7,000 people for a year and a half. After this area was converted to Chiang's control last winter, yarn and cloth exchange stations and textile cooperatives in various places distributed cotton to the countryside to spin and collect yarn, and held textile competitions to improve the quality of yarn and cloth. Now the top-grade homespun cloth has surpassed Nantong cloth, and the lower-grade cloth has decreased from 70 percent in the past to 10 percent.

Xinhua News Agency, Central China, 10th: The military and civilians in Central Jiangsu are striving to rescue cotton fields in the reclamation area. The Dazhongji cotton reclamation area, one of the four major cotton-producing areas in the country, has recently suffered from continuous rain, and weeds are rampant in the cotton fields, causing tens of thousands of acres of cotton to wither. The local democratic government organized all the labor in the reclamation area to launch a surprise attack on weeding, allocated 100 dan of grain to purchase a large number of weeding farm tools, and organized weeding teams from Dazhongji city residents and thousands of farmers from neighboring areas, some from as far as hundreds of miles away, to assist in the surprise attack. Troops and agency personnel also launched a "love-the-people weeding" campaign. A certain detachment, except for one or two people to watch the house, sent all commanders and fighters to the fields. A certain team of students weeded more than 200 mu every day, and many people weeded while sick. The confidence of the masses in the reclamation area in saving cotton has greatly increased.

    【新华社华中十日电】苏北蒋后五千五百翻身青年于八一建军节前后涌入解放军。彼等曾身受蒋军暴行，满怀着复仇与彻底打垮蒋军的愤怒。沭阳六十老翁沈增和送子入伍时谆谆训诫说：“只要记住家里得田翻身，你就要好好打老蒋！”
