　　Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 29th—Wedemeyer flew from Tokyo to Seoul, Korea, on the 26th. This trip carries an extremely dangerous mission: to fundamentally undermine the resolutions of the Moscow Conference on the Korean issue, to support traitorous organizations and puppet governments, so as to turn Korea into an important base for the United States to implement its expansionist policy in the East. According to a Central News Agency dispatch on the 23rd, "The United States is preparing to abandon all efforts to unify Korea through the US-Soviet Joint Commission and may proceed with an 'American plan'." The dispatch reported: "Most people in Washington believe that if a government is established in South Korea, Syngman Rhee (a leading anti-Soviet and anti-democratic figure in Korea) is expected to receive US support to become the head of the government." United Press dispatches on the 24th and 25th also said: "Wedemeyer's biggest problem in Korea will be to devise the best way to 'aid' South Korea." During Wedemeyer's two-day stay in Tokyo, sources confirmed that it was to consult with MacArthur to decide to further intensify the cultivation of Japanese fascists to replace Chiang Kai-shek as the United States' number one watchdog, in order to further engage in the criminal collusion of sabotaging peace and democracy in the Far East. According to a United Press Tokyo dispatch on the 25th, Wedemeyer "is working in Japan according to the same plan and methods implemented during his month-long stay in China. The Republican newspaper 'Santiago Times' made it clearer about Wedemeyer's great conspiracy to go to Japan: to make 'Japan replace China, because Chiang Kai-shek has lost the opportunity to lead Asia'." According to the newspaper, the steps Wedemeyer is taking to achieve this goal are: "To build Japan into an alliance of the United States in the Far East, to offset the Sovietization of the East by restoring Japan, this is the only key that the United States is apparently preparing to take." It is reported that Wedemeyer will conduct an eight- to ten-day "investigation" in Korea, and then "combine the reports of China and Korea" to report to Truman.

    独占朝鲜作扩张基地
    【新华社陕北二十九日电】魏德于二十六日自东京飞抵朝鲜汉城，此行衔有极其险毒之任务，即在根本破坏莫斯科会议时朝鲜问题之决议，扶植奸组织傀儡政府，以便变朝鲜为美国在东方实行扩张政策的重要基地之一。据中央社二十三日电透露：“美国准备放弃借苏美共同委员会朝鲜统一之一切努力，可能进行一‘美国计划’”。该电报导：“华府大多数人士认为，如南鲜成立政府，李承晚（按系朝鲜反苏反民主头子）可望获得美国之支持出任政府首长”。合众社二十四、二十五两日电也说：“魏在朝鲜的最大问题，将是设想出‘援助’南鲜的最好方法。”魏德迈逗留东京的两天内，据各方消息证实：是为了与麦克阿瑟磋商，决定更加紧培植日本法西斯，代替蒋介石充当美国的头号警犬，以便进一步事破坏远东和平民主的罪恶勾当。据合众社东京二十五日电泄露：魏德迈“依照在中国逗留一月期中所实行的同样计划与方法在日本进行工作。魏德迈去日本之大阴谋，美共和报纸‘桑提奥时报’更说得明白：为使‘日本代替中。ń?┒???接惺屏χ?抗??颉者已丧失领导亚洲之机会”。魏德迈为达此目的所采取之步骤，据该报载称：“将日本建立为美国远东之联盟，借恢复日本以抵销东方的维埃化，这是美国当前显然要准备采取的唯一关键。”据悉，魏德在朝鲜将作八天至十天之“调查”，然后“把中国与朝鲜的报告联系配合”，向杜鲁门报告。
