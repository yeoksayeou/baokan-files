Xinhua News Agency, Jinji Lu Yu, 13th: Wherever there are enemies, there are sparks of fire. The landmine explosion movement in the border areas of Taihang has achieved remarkable development in the tense battle to protect grain. On July 17th, more than 300 Yan puppet troops from Taigu Houcheng, ＠ Village and other places robbed grain in the Xishan Bottom area. As soon as they entered the entrance of Xishan Bottom Village, they stepped on a landmine, killing one enemy soldier and one animal. The enemy panicked and fled to the outside of the village, but was blocked by our militia. The enemy tried to set up a machine gun on the mountain for cover, but unexpectedly encountered a landmine, and the machine gun was blown into several pieces, killing two enemy soldiers. The enemy hurriedly dragged the corpses down the mountain, but the landmines at the foot of the mountain greeted them again. The Yan puppet troops hurriedly fled to the jujube forest outside the village and fired at the pursuing militia with machine guns. With a bang, the enemy's machine gun and gunner were destroyed again. For a time, explosions rang out on the mountain, at the foot of the mountain, inside and outside the village, forcing the enemy to load the corpses onto their vehicles and flee in panic. When the enemy arrived at Nanzhang Village, they were blocked again by the "Intercepting Fate Mine" that we had hurriedly buried, killing two enemy soldiers. In this operation, a total of 19 Yan puppet troops were killed or wounded. The next day, the enemy returned to Qiangfangya and other villages in the fourth district of the county to rob grain, and fell into a landmine network again, resulting in 17 dead and wounded. We suffered no casualties in either engagement. In terms of mine-laying methods, we have broken away from the old methods of the past and created many methods targeting the enemy's movements. For example, the enemy in Jiaozuo, northern Henan, often harassed Nan Temple Ridge. The local militia buried landmines there, resulting in explosions for four consecutive days, killing five enemy soldiers. In particular, the laying of "cluster mines" has the greatest effect. The Gao Yi Armed Work Team in western Hebei buried 60 landmines at once between Dongkantai and Sizhuang in the county. The enemy fell into a maze, triggering 13 mines in a row. Secondly, there is the courageous tactic of engaging the enemy with mines. The Zanhuang Armed Work Team buried three landmines in the south gate of Yuanshi City. The next day, the enemy stepped on them. In order to prevent the enemy from escaping, Lin Yi and other places invented mines that exploded upon both stepping and lifting. Furthermore, there is the flexible combination of cold gun warfare. Under the blows of our explosion warfare, the enemy and puppet troops in various places were frightened and trembled at the mention of mines, and dared not come out to disturb us. The vast area south of Yuanshi ××× City is designated as a "minefield," and orders have been issued to subordinates not to pass through it.

　　太行发展爆炸运动
  　周围敌伪谈雷色变
    【新华社晋冀鲁豫十三日电】那里有敌人那里开火花。太行边沿区地雷爆炸运动，在紧张的护粮战斗中，获惊人发展。七月十七日，太谷侯城、＠村等地阎伪三百余向我西山底一带抢粮，刚入西山底村口，即踏响地雷一颗，炸死敌一名，牲口一头。敌慌向村外窜逃被我民兵阻击，敌想把机枪架到山上掩护，不料又碰上地雷，机枪被炸成数截，炸死敌人二名，敌急拖尸下山，山下地雷又迎敌而炸，阎伪慌忙向村外枣树林逃避，并以机枪向追击民兵扫射，轰的一声，敌机枪及射手又全毁。一时山上山下，村里村外，雷声四起，迫使敌满载尸首彩号狼狈回窜。当敌至南张村时，又被我赶埋之“截命雷”拦住，炸死敌二名。此次共计炸死炸伤阎伪十九名。次日敌复向该县四区箭方崖等村抢粮，又陷地雷网中，死伤十七名，我两次均无伤亡。在埋雷方法上，打破过去的老一套办法，针对着敌人行动规律创造许多办法。如豫北焦作之敌常到南寺岭骚扰，当地民兵就把地雷埋到那里，四天四炸，死敌五名。特别是埋设“群雷”，效力最大。冀西高邑武工队，在该县东看台至寺庄之间一次埋雷六十颗，敌人陷入迷魂阵中，一连踏响十三颗，其次是勇敢的接敌埋雷。赞皇武工队，把三颗地雷埋到元氏城南关，次日敌人即上了靶，为了不叫敌人逃走，林邑等地均发明了踏和起都炸的雷。再次即用冷枪战的灵活结合。各地敌伪在我爆炸运动打击下，心惊肉跳，谈雷色变，不敢出扰，元氏×××城南广大地区为“雷区”，下令部下不准通行。
