　　Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 28th: Amidst Chiang Kai-shek's government's loud cries of "anti-smuggling," the reality proves that it is Chiang Kai-shek's civil and military officials who are engaged in smuggling. Their smuggling activities in South China have become increasingly rampant. Because the smuggling of American goods is dealing a fatal blow to China's national industry, it has caused great anxiety in domestic industrial circles. A Kuomintang News Agency broadcast on the 26th quoted a party newspaper editorial admitting: "Those engaged in this illegal behavior (referring to smuggling) are not only treacherous merchants and bad elements, but also unscrupulous military personnel and unlawful officials colluding with each other. Reports state that smuggling gangs in Hong Kong and Guangdong have certain individuals as backgrounds, indicating that smuggling in South China has become an unimaginable situation." The newspaper acknowledged that smuggling is a "hemorrhage" for the national economy and the Chiang government's finances, and described it as: "Currently, the trend of smuggling prevails throughout the country, and it is even more rampant in South China. Reports state that a large amount of silver in Guangzhou recently flowed into Hong Kong, reaching more than 30,000 taels in one day. Smuggled goods seized from a cargo boat were valued at 110 million yuan. Smugglers often engage in armed conflict with anti-smuggling troops. Zhou Shu, a British employee of the Chinese Customs, was shot and killed by smugglers. Smuggling in the South China area is not only large-scale, involving huge quantities of imported and exported goods, but also a organized and planned operation, and often possesses strong armed forces for cover." Furthermore, according to a Guangzhou dispatch in the Tianjin Dagongbao on the 16th of last month: Yu Xian, the former intelligence captain (chief of secret service) of the Guangdong Security Command, and Li Guoxiang, an intelligence agent (secret agent) of the Xing Yuan, were both detained for involvement in smuggling cases, and both were "widely implicated." On the evening of the 6th of last month, the seizure of smuggling cases involving Saigon and US currency "also involved a wide range of people." On the 8th of last month, road police and military police at the Guangzhou-Kowloon Railway Station even staged a full-scale martial arts performance over "anti-smuggling," with both sides bringing out machine guns and glaring at each other, almost leading to bloodshed. Although the incident was "resolved" through reconciliation by the superiors of both sides, one police chief was severely beaten.

　　蒋党军人官吏狼狈为奸
  　港粤走私益炽
    【新华社陕北二十八日电】蒋在政府大嚷“缉私”声中，事实却证明从事走私的，就是蒋介石的文武大员们；他们近来在华南走私的活动，是愈加凶猛了。由于美货走私正给予中国民族工业致命打击，因此引起国内工业界极大不安。国民党通讯社在二十六日广播的党报社论中自供：“从事此种不法行为（指走私）者，不尽为奸商莠民，更有不肖之军人与不法之官吏互相勾结，狼狈为奸。报载港粤走私有某某等帮，由某某及某某等为背景等语，足见华南走私，已成为一种不堪想象之局面”。该报承认走私为国民经济且为蒋政府财政的一种“溢血症”，并描述称：“目前走私之风遍于全国，华南更为炽盛。报载最近广州白银大量流入香港，一日之间达三万余两，某一货艇被缉获之私货，即值一亿一千万元之巨。走私者常与缉私部队武装冲突，中国海关英籍职员周舒遭走私开枪中弹殉职。华南一带之走私，不仅规模甚大，对进出口之货物数量甚巨，且系有组织有计划之行动，并经常拥有雄厚之武力以为掩护。”另据上月十六日天津大公报载广州通信：前粤保安司令部谍报队长（特务头子）余贤、行辕情报员（特务）李国祥，均因与走私案有关被扣，且均“牵连甚广。”上月六日晚，缉获西贡钞及美钞走私案，“牵涉亦大”。上月八日，广九车站路警与宪兵双方，还因为“缉私”表演了一幕全武行，双方均抬出机关枪列阵睨对，几酿成血案，虽经双方长官和“和解”而告平息，但警方警长一人已被殴重伤。
