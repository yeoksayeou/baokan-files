　　【Report from This Newspaper, Jilu豫, 20th】 The masses in Yuan Dongshao, Anzhuang, and other villages in Nanle have established poor peasant leadership and recognized that all poor people under heaven are one family. They have been sending gifts to impoverished villages. After the poor peasants in Yuan Dongshao village in the Fourth District took charge, they realized that the lives of some poor brothers in other villages had not yet improved, and decided to send gifts to these poor villages. However, some people did not agree, so they discussed: "Where did the things confiscated from the landlords come from?" Everyone agreed: "They came from the landlords' exploitation and oppression of the poor in the past!" Then, they discussed: "The landlords in our village also exploited the poor in other villages. The pit of poverty in our village has been filled, but what about the poor brothers in other villages who are still starving?" At this point, everyone's thinking was aligned. Each group started a competition to see which group could send the most and best items. On the 5th, the village resounded with gongs and drums as they sent a large cart, a millstone, ten *shi* of wheat, one hundred new clothes, and dozens of pieces of furniture to Wang Dongshao village. Wang Jinlian of Da Liu village in the Second District had been a hired laborer for fifty years and had never even worn a new pair of shoes in his life. When it came to distributing the fruits of victory, he was not satisfied because his village was too poor to meet his needs. After the masses in Anzhuang in the Fifth District learned about this, they decided that they would rather have less for themselves in order to help their poor brothers in other villages overturn their situation. They voluntarily sent nine *shi* of coarse grain, thirty-six pieces of clothing, ten pieces of furniture, and forty *jin* of cotton to the masses in the Second District, demonstrating a high degree of class friendship.

　　袁东邵等村群众帮助穷村翻身
    【本报冀鲁豫二十日电】南乐袁东邵、安庄等村树立贫农领导骨干，认识了天下穷人是一家，纷纷给穷村送礼。四区袁东邵村贫农当家后，知道有些村的穷兄弟们，生活仍未改善，决定往穷村送礼，但这些人不同意，于是便讨论：“清算地主的东西是哪里来的？”大家一致意见是：“地主过去剥削压迫穷人得来的！”接着，就讨论：“咱村的地主也有剥削外村穷人的，咱村的穷坑已填起来，而外村穷兄弟还挨饿怎么办？”这时，大家的思想打通了，各组掀起比赛，看哪组送的东西又多又好。五日，村中锣鼓喧天的把一辆大车，一盘磨、十石麦子、一百件新衣服、数十件家具送到王东邵村。二区大刘村王金连当了五十年雇工，一生连一双新鞋都没有穿过，分果实时，因该庄穷不能满足他的要求，五区安庄群众知道后，决定宁愿自己少要点东西，得帮助外村穷兄弟翻身，便自觉自愿的送给二区群众粗粮—九石、衣服三十六件，家具十件，棉花四十斤，发扬了高度的阶级友爱。
