Xinhua News Agency, Shandong, 29th: Yantai's commercial and industrial sectors are flourishing in conjunction with the needs of the broad countryside. According to statistics, a total of 795 businesses opened in the city at the beginning of this year, and now, including newly opened and re-opened businesses, the number has increased to 4,319. Eighty-eight small stalls and itinerant merchants have developed into storefronts. The city's various industries employ more than 5,000 workers. Industrial and commercial entrepreneurs from the Yantai administrative region are carrying funds back to their villages to do business, and so far, the number has reached 45. Merchants from other places are also coming to Yantai to invest, totaling 40 million Northern Currency (hereinafter referred to as "Northern Currency," with each yuan equivalent to 20 yuan in Kuomintang currency). The money industry has developed the fastest, increasing from 9 to 17 institutions. The total number of transactions was only 70,000 yuan in January, but it increased to 80 million yuan in April, and further exceeded 100 million yuan in June, more than 13 times in half a year. The achievement of the above results is mainly due to the land reform and the development of the peasant and fisherman production movement, in addition to the democratic government's multi-faceted support and the thorough implementation of the labor-capital cooperation policy. The emancipated peasants and fishermen need a large number of agricultural implements and fishing gear, and the supply cannot meet the demand, so the tinplate industry has increased from 160 at the end of last year to 238, and the fishing industry has increased from 86 to 108. The Aquatic Products Company is now harvesting the kelp (commonly known as seaweed) planted last year, and is preparing to plant another 8.25 million yuan worth this year, which is expected to yield more than one million catties next year. The textile industry, one of the main industries in Yantai, has increased from 132 to 191. Other daily necessities industries are also thriving. The transportation industry has also developed accordingly, with the number of transport vehicles increasing from 5 to 41, and large trucks, small trucks, and bicycles are constantly on the road.

　　与广大农村需要相结合
  　烟市工商业日盛
    【新华社山东二十九】烟（台）市工商业与广大农村需要结合蒸蒸日上。据统计，全市今年初开业共七百九十五家，现在连新开与复业者已增至四千三百一十九家。小摊、行商有八十八家发展为门市。全市各业工人达五千余人。管区之烟借工商业家纷纷携带资金返里营业，前后已达四十五人，外地商人亦相继来烟投资，共达四千万元北币（以下均以北计，每元折合蒋币二十元）。银钱业发展最速，由九家增至十七家，其交易总数一月份仅为七万元，四月份即增至八万万元，六月份更超越十万万元，半年中即超过十三倍以上。上述成绩之获得除民主政府多方扶助及劳资合作政策之贯澈外，主要由于土地改革及农民渔民生产运动之展开。翻身农民、渔民需要大量农具和渔具，等供不应求，洋铁业遂由去年底之一百六十家一而为二百三十八家，渔业由八十六家增至一百零八家。水产公司现正收割去年下种之昆布（俗名海带），今年又准备以八百二十五万元下种，预计明年即可收割百余万斤。烟市主要工业之一的纺织业，则由一卅二家，增至一百九十一家。其他日用品各业，亦无不欣欣向荣。交通运输业，也随之发展，运输汽车由五辆增至四十一辆，大车、小车、脚踏车络绎途。
