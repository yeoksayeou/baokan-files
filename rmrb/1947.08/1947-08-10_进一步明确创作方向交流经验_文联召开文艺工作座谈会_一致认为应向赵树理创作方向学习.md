    Further Clarifying Creative Direction, Exchanging Experiences
    Literary Federation Convenes Symposium on Literary and Artistic Work
    Unanimously Agrees to Learn from Zhao Shuli's Creative Direction
    [This Newspaper Special] Under the direction of the Propaganda Department of the Central Bureau, the Border Region Literary Federation convened a symposium on literary and artistic work at the Border Region Literary Federation's location. This was done to further clarify the direction of literary and artistic creation, study and resolve certain outstanding issues in literary and artistic work, and thereby mobilize literary and artistic workers in the border region to more actively participate in the great patriotic self-defense war, land reform, and the great production movement. Attendees included Wang Zhongqing from the Propaganda Department of the Central Bureau, Gao Muhong from the Taihang Literary Federation, Wang Yaping from the Hebei-Shandong-Henan Literary Federation, Zhao Shuli, Wang Chun, Zhang Rong, and Miao Peishi from Xinhua Bookstore, Yuan Bo and Zheng Zhidong from the People's Daily, Liu Yangqiao and Shao Wei from the People's Art Work Troupe, and Huang Mei, Hei Ding, Lu Li, and Xia Qing from the Border Region Literary Federation, totaling dozens of people. The meeting lasted for sixteen days. The conference first discussed Zhao Shuli's creative work. During the discussion, everyone studied the works in a pragmatic manner, and referred to the comments on Zhao Shuli's creative work by Guo Moruo, Mao Dun, Zhou Yang, and others, as well as Zhao Shuli's own account of his creative process and methods. After repeated and enthusiastic discussions, a consensus was reached that Zhao Shuli's creative spirit and achievements should be the specific direction for literary and artistic workers in the border region to practice Mao Zedong's literary and artistic thought.

    Secondly, certain outstanding issues in literary and artistic creation were addressed. The conference raised issues such as the transformation of intellectual literary and artistic workers, improvement and popularization, and content and form. After heated discussions, it was finally agreed that the essence of these issues was whether literary and artistic workers were determined to thoroughly transform themselves, immediately shed their burdens, and serve the masses.

    The second notable discussion topic of the meeting was Comrade Wang Yaping's work report on the folk art department of the Hebei-Shandong-Henan Literary Federation. They had made significant gains in transforming old and folk artists. All comrades felt that not enough attention had been paid to the rural literary and artistic movement in the past, especially the lack of planned and organized assistance and leadership. It was decided that literary federations in various regions should strengthen their work in this area in the future and learn from the Hebei-Shandong-Henan Literary Federation.

    In addition, the conference reviewed the experience of editing magazines in various regions, and believed that whether a magazine can be run well mainly depends on close integration with the real struggle, striving for mass-oriented language and form, and establishing close communication and liaison with the majority of readers. Such as the New Masses, Literary Magazine and so on. In the last two days of the conference, issues such as general cultural work, future work of the Literary Federation, and the relationship between cultural workers and other aspects of work were discussed. It was unanimously advocated that literary and artistic workers should participate more in general popular cultural work to seize positions from feudal culture.

    At the closing of the meeting, Comrade Panshi, Deputy Director of the Propaganda Department of the Central Bureau, came to participate, gave detailed instructions on the various issues discussed at the meeting, and highly praised Zhao Shuli's works. He believed that his works were politically strong, full of love for the peasants and "younger generation" characters, and full of hatred for landlords like Yan Hengyuan. The class stance of the entire work was very clear, and he hoped that everyone would learn from Zhao Shuli's creative spirit. Regarding the tasks of the Literary Federation, Comrade Panshi emphasized two points: First, we should summarize typical experiences and promote good things. Second, each comrade should show their works to others. Go to the countryside to deepen practical experience, experience life, and transform oneself. When going to the countryside, put down the airs, willingly be a primary school student, and learn from the artistic creations and achievements of the masses. Third, the current central tasks are war, land reform, and the great production movement. If you reflect these three tasks, you are the number one worker. On the contrary, it is futile to be divorced from the current political tasks, central work, and empty complaints about "not paying attention to cultural work." Finally, Comrade Huang Mei announced the successful conclusion of the meeting, hoping that the comrades present would bring the content and spirit of the meeting back to their respective regions to promote and develop the literary and artistic movement in the border region. What should be particularly mentioned here is that the literary and artistic work of the troops has made great progress in the past year, going deep into the companies, reflecting the self-defense war, producing good works, and producing many authors, but due to the tight schedule, they were not invited to participate in time, and we sincerely apologize. After the closing of the conference, the People's Art Work Troupe specially performed famous Yan'an Yangge operas such as "Husband and Wife Learn to Read," "Brother and Sister Reclaim Wasteland," and "Herding Pigs" to add to the fun.

    进一步明确创作方向交流经验
    文联召开文艺工作座谈会
    一致认为应向赵树理创作方向学习
    【本报特讯】边区文联在中央局宣传部指示下，为更进一步明确文艺创作方向，研究与解决文艺工作方面尚存在的某些问题，借以号召边区文艺工作者更积极参加伟大的爱国自卫战争、土地改革、大生产运动；特于边区文联驻地召开文艺工作座谈会。到会者有中央局宣传部王中青，太行文联高沐鸿，冀鲁豫文联王亚平，新华书店赵树理、王春、章容、苗培时，人民日报袁勃、郑之东，人民文艺工作团刘仰峤、邵惟，边区文联荒煤、黑丁、鲁藜、夏青等数十人。会议进行共十六天。大会首先讨论赵树理创作。在讨论过程中，大家实事求是的研究作品，并参考郭沫若、茅盾、周扬等对赵树理创作的评论及赵树理创作过程、创作方法的自述。反复热烈讨论，最后获得一致意见，认为赵树理的创作精神及其成果，实应为边区文艺工作者实践毛泽东文艺思想的具体方向。
    其次解决文艺创作方面尚存在的某些问题。大会提出知识分子文艺工作者的改造，提高与普及，内容与形式等问题。经过大家热烈讨论，最后认为这些问题实质上还是文艺工作者是否下决心彻底改造自己，即刻放下包袱为群众服务的问题。
    会议第二个引人注意的讨论内容，是王亚平同志关于冀鲁豫文联民间艺术部的工作报告，他们在改造旧艺人、民间艺人方面有了相当重大的收获。全体同志感到过去对于农村文艺运动注意都还不够，特别是缺乏有计划有组织的去帮助领导，决定今后各地区文联应特别加强这方面的工作，向冀鲁豫文联看齐。
    此外，会上检讨了各地区杂志编辑工作经验，认为一个杂志能否办好，主要依赖与现实斗争密切结合，语言形式力求群众化，与广大读者建立密切的通联工作。如新大众、文艺杂志即是如此。大会最后两日，谈及一般文化工作、文联今后工作、文化工作者与其他方面工作关系等问题，一致主张文艺工作者应多多参加一般通俗文化工作，向封建文化夺取阵地。
    会议闭幕时，中央局宣传部副部长磐石同志赶来参加，对大会讨论各项问题有详细指示，对赵树理作品极为推崇，认为他的作品政治性强，对农民对“小字辈”的人物充满热爱，对地主阎恒元一类人物充满憎恨。整个作品阶级立场非常明显，希望大家学习赵树理的创作精神。对文联任务，磐石同志着重提出两点：一、应该总结典型经验，把好的东西拿出来提倡。二、每个同志拿出作品给人家看。下乡深入实际，体验生活，改造自己。下乡就要放下架子，甘当小学生，向群众的艺术创造与成就学习。三、当前中心工作是战争、土地改革、大生产，你反映了这三种工作，你就是第一位工作。反是，脱离当前政治任务、中心工作、空喊埋怨“不重视文化工作”是无济于事的。最后荒煤同志宣布会议胜利结束，希到会同志将会议内容、精神带回各地，借以推动与开展边区文艺运动。此地应特别提出的，是一年来部队文艺工作有很大开展，深入连队，反映了自卫战争，产生了很好的作品，涌现出许多作者，但因会期仓促，未赶及邀请参加，深致歉意。大会闭幕后，人民文艺工作团特演出夫妻识字、兄妹开荒、赶猪等延安秧歌名剧助兴。
