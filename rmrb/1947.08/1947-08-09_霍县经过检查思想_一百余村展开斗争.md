Following the self-criticism of standpoints by cadres in Huo County, work has made great strides forward, with widespread struggle in one hundred and eighteen natural villages. Following a general ideological review by cadres throughout the county, over six hundred and seventy turned-over heroes and activists in various villages have also successively reviewed their own situation and ideology since their emancipation. 118 villages in the fourth district, near the city and along the railway line, quickly broke through the situation. In Beiguan Township, five feudal tycoons were liquidated within two days. Reactionary landlords Wang Tuocai, Han Daolong, and Lan Xianggui from Zhu Yang Village, seeing the peasants rise up to struggle, conspired to tie up Xiao Gou, a turned-over activist, in the middle of the night, and attempted to beat him to death. However, this was discovered by militiamen and peasants from surrounding villages, who automatically came to the rescue. In particular, the militiamen from Tuisha and Beiguan quickly gathered, fixed bayonets, and rushed into Lan Xianggui's home to rescue their turned-over brother. Lan Xianggui fled into the wild, but was surrounded and captured by the militiamen. Xiao Gou was rescued, and the masses in the four streets of the city also began to voice their grievances against local bullies and landlords. The masses in Song Village, together with the masses in Chengguan, are jointly liquidating the large landlord Cao's properties in Zhuang, Xiazhuang, Nantian, Duanzhuang, Yinni, Hongyabao, and other villages. The masses are also brewing and engaging in struggle against the landlords. The peasants of Zhu Yang Village said: "The world is already ours, with Chairman Mao in charge, we are not afraid of anything, we must carry it through to the end."
