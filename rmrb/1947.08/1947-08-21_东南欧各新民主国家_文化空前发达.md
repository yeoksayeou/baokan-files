Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 19th -- Comprehensive reports: A great cultural development in the new democratic countries of Southeast Europe. Under the old regime's policy of keeping the people ignorant, more than half of the adult population in Southeast European countries were illiterate, and the proportion of illiterates in the countryside accounted for a staggering 80% of the total population. Now, the democratic regimes of these countries guarantee the revival and full development of the people's cultural life. Last year, 300,000 people in Yugoslavia learned to read and write, which is more than was cultivated in the old Yugoslavia in the past 23 years. In the same year, one million people in Romania attended night school, exceeding the total number of people enrolled since the founding of the country. In Albania, 75% of the country was illiterate in the past. Now, hundreds of schools have been opened, and hundreds of thousands of young and old men and women are studying enthusiastically, and a large number of short-term industrial schools are training skilled workers for Albania's new industries. In the Czech Republic, all of the more than 8,000 primary and secondary schools that had been dissolved under Nazi oppression were restored in January last year, and a new and larger network of technical schools was established. In these countries, higher education is no longer the privilege of a few upper-class people. Higher education institutions in the Czech Republic, including the famous Prague University, have been restored one after another, and a new university with 2,000 students has been established in Olomouc. Due to the government's allocation of large amounts of funding and scholarships, the total number of students in specialized colleges and universities increased to 59,400 in the last academic year. Poland, which was devastated by the war, has established three universities and new technical colleges, nautical colleges, and Slavic language colleges in Warsaw, Krakow, Toruń, and Gdańsk. New universities have been established in Plovdiv, Varna, and Ruse in Bulgaria, and the number of students at Sofia University has increased from 12,000 to 30,000. The development of publishing and film industries in various countries also symbolizes cultural progress. Last year, the number of books published in Poland, Yugoslavia, and Bulgaria exceeded four times the average annual publication volume before the war. The total number of books published in Poland alone reached 30 million copies. In the Czech Republic, the number of books published in Czech alone reached 57 million copies last year. The country has produced 19 films since its liberation and established 150 cinemas, which will be increased to 600 when the two-year plan is completed.

    【新华社陕北十九日电】综合报导：东南欧新民主主义各国文化大发展。在旧政权的愚民政策下，东南欧各国一半以上的成年国民是文盲，乡村文盲更占全人口百分之八十的惊人比例。现在这些国家的民主政权保证了人民文化生活的苏生与充分发展。去年一年中，南斯拉夫有三十万人学会读和写，比旧南国过去二十三年中所培养的还多。同年在罗马尼亚，进夜校的达一百万人，超过该国立国以来就学的总人数。阿尔巴尼亚过去全国有百分之七十五的人目不识丁。现在则开办了几百所学校，几十万青年和老年男女在热情的学习，并有大量的短期工业学校为阿国的新工业训练技术工人。捷克在去年一月就恢复了全部在纳粹压迫下解散了的八千多所中小学，而且成立了新的更广大的工艺学校网。在这些国家中，高等教育也不再是少数上等人的特权。捷克各高等教育的院校，包括有名的布拉格大学，都已次第恢复，而且在阿里木克还成立了拥有两千学生的新大学。由于政府拨予大量经费与奖学金，上年度专科以上院校学生的总额增至五万九千四百人。惨遭战争破坏的波兰，已在华沙、克拉科、托伦、但泽成立了三所大学与新的技术学院、航海学院和斯洛文语学院等。保加利亚的普罗夫迪夫、伐尔那与卢斯楚克都设立了新大学，索非亚大学学生则有一万二千人增到三万人。各国出版与电影业的发达，也象征着文化的进步。去年一年中波、南、保三国出版的书籍，超过战前每年平均出版量的四倍。单波兰出版的书籍总数，就达三千万册。而捷克去年单以捷克文出版的书籍，就已达五千七百万册。该国解放以来已摄制影片十九种，建立电影院一百五十所，在两年计划完成时，将增至六百所。
