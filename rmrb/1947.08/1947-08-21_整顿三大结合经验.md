　　Rectifying the Experience of the Three Great Combinations
　　Ju Lin, Jiang Wen

　　In Yangjingdi, except for two households, the entire village has been organized, forming three mutual aid brigades and thirteen mutual aid teams. Using the brigade as a unit, there are also three larger small-scale cooperatives, possessing capital of over 1.5 million yuan. Fixed labor is drawn out to engage in sideline production year-round. They cook and eat in the cooperative, earning money and distributing profits according to a labor-capital ratio of 80/20. Each mutual aid team also flexibly draws people to engage in sideline activities (selling apricots, transportation, etc.).

　　After the first weeding was completed, the entire village calculated the work exchange accounts. Each small-scale cooperative also calculated accounts and distributed profits. Sideline personnel detached from production for profit distribution (excluding employed relationships) all suffered losses. For example, Liu Shengcai's small-scale cooperative distributed 9,000 yuan in dividends in half a year but had to pay out nine *dou* of millet for labor exchange for wartime service, equivalent to more than 14,000 yuan at market price, and even owed wages for farm work at home. As a result, people engaged in sideline production quit, and the sideline activities of the teams also ran into problems, reflecting that the profit distribution was unreasonable, that sideline labor benefited too much by receiving 80%, and that people with more land also benefited. As a result, all sideline production in the village (except spinning) became inactive, the donkeys of the small-scale cooperatives were tied up, sideline labor stayed at home, and the sideline activities of the teams (transportation, etc.) were no longer active.

　　After the situation developed, they consulted with comrades leading sideline production to clarify that sideline production was not unprofitable. Thus, they convened cadres, sideline cadres, and production personnel for informal discussions, and discovered the main reasons for the inactivity. Liu Banghai said, "Last year, the dividends were worth a lot (prices were low), and everything could be taken care of. This year, the dividends aren’t even enough for shoes! And then there's the work exchange millet. If we keep doing this, we'll lose money." Zhang Ze said, "If we do sideline work for a day, we just work for free. If we give us three *sheng* of millet (excluding food) for cultivating the land for a day, we can't afford the wages." Er Ze said, "After working for a year and a half, we can't even get a load of manure for our eight or nine *mu* of land. We don't even want to do the small plot. If we hire someone for three *sheng* of millet a day, we'll still owe them five *dou* of millet in wages. Even if we draw out several thousand yuan in dividends, we'll spend it all, and then we'll have to pay out a *shi* of work exchange millet.” Lian Shu said, "If we can cover food and clothing with the work exchange millet, we can do it." From this, it was studied that the main reason was that sideline labor and agricultural labor did not have work exchange, plus high prices and low dividends, sideline labor suffered losses. Therefore, basically, this problem should be solved in the work exchange and dividend distribution. Thus, everyone was inspired to figure out how to do it. Everyone said that the direction (method) must be changed to overcome the difficulties, so they asked everyone to discuss how to change the direction. However, everyone lacked confidence, saying that they couldn't come up with a solution, that the good workers could only take care of one side (earn money and take care of the cooperative), and that the bad workers would fail on both sides (couldn't take care of the family or the cooperative). Some even said that this was a case of not achieving success or profit! At that time, the leadership pointed out that if you can start a business, you can maintain it, and that since we created the small-scale cooperatives, we can continue them. "Everyone is Zhuge Liang, and with many people, there are many good ideas." We are like the Eight Immortals crossing the sea, each displaying their unique abilities to see whose method is the best. We must achieve success and profit. With this encouragement, everyone said, "Difficulties can't stop us." After a day of individual brewing in life, two methods were proposed: one was to unify agricultural, sideline, and wartime service work exchange, and that each cooperative would not cook and eat separately, and that the dividend distribution method would be changed; the other was either large or small, that is, to merge the small-scale cooperatives into one large cooperative, or to distribute the funds to agricultural teams to carry out sideline activities. Everyone discussed that merging into one unit would not work, and distributing the funds to the teams would not allow for frequent activities or big profits. The first method was still feasible.

　　Although the direction (method) of change was proposed, they were not active in changing the method. Some sideline personnel and cadres were satisfied with the past extravagance of cooking and eating separately, and resisted the idea, saying, "Even if we study it for half a year, it won't count. Let's sell the livestock and distribute the shares!" The village cadres were afraid of the trouble, saying that work exchange takes time, and if we want to do it well, the whole village would have to have three researchers and two accountants detached from production every day. Therefore, using the method of comparison, they cited Wu Houli's team, which did not cook separately for sideline production, earning 10,000 yuan in five days of weeding, and the team members were very satisfied with the distribution of salt and garlic, which also made money. The ×× small-scale cooperative ate and drank 340,000 yuan in half a year, but the sideline workers could not afford the work exchange millet, and everyone (referring to funds) could not get dividends. After this comparison, everyone understood, and the party branch even proposed that whoever creates it first will be given a merit.

　　After the cadres' thinking was clear, the question before them was whether to first create a typical example to promote the general situation, or to launch simultaneously in each team? We estimated the basic conditions of each team, especially the competitive mentality and our cadre strength, and believed that there were sufficient conditions for a comprehensive launch, so we started comprehensively. We convened a mass meeting of the brigade and the whole village to repeatedly discuss and study and resolve many people's thoughts.

　　The masses were most concerned about the fear of suffering losses. For example, regarding the issue of discounting work, agricultural labor all said that sideline work for a day should be discounted by ten points, which would be even more severe than work exchange in the future (they were particularly afraid that sideline work would lose money). Sideline labor said: This won't even cover our mouths. The cadres then guided everyone to discuss and clarify that if sideline workers didn't earn money by discounting work, they wouldn't dare to make mistakes, and that the wages and dividends earned in sideline work were all earned by them, and couldn't burden agricultural labor. In this way, everyone understood and said: This is what we want, for more people to go out and do sideline work. The more they do, the more money they earn, the more everyone can distribute, and the more they can distribute. They explained to sideline labor that doing one day of work is equal to one day of work, and that the land has also been cultivated, so you don't have to pay work exchange millet and can still get dividends. In the end, it was clear that no one would suffer losses, and everyone said that this is truly one point of labor for one point of blessing, and everyone is stepping up their labor. The ratio of labor to capital in the distribution of funds (shares) was reversed, becoming 80/20, so the masses couldn't understand it and said that capital suffered too much, and that everyone wanted to withdraw their shares. In solving this problem, it was explained that capital is dead, and that earning money mainly depends on labor, and that distributing more dividends to capital is exploiting labor. Taking the Shangsanzui Cooperative as an example, last year a team member invested 30,000 yuan in shares and received a dividend of 48,000 yuan in half a year, which could buy 15 *shi* of millet at the market price at that time. After this calculation, everyone's thinking was clear.

　　In the atmosphere of mutual competition among the teams, there were also many creations in specific methods. For example, Wang Qiao's team created a work exchange method for transportation based on weight and distance (70 *jin* and 60 *li* is ten points), which was both flexible and simple. For example, Liu Shengcai's team stipulated a progressive reward of 50% to 30% in order to stimulate the average daily earnings of sideline labor, which was a very good method.

　　After eight days of intense work, all four brigades and 190 households in the village, except for two, implemented unified management of agriculture, sideline production, and wartime service, unified evaluation of work, unified work tickets, unified accounting, and a comprehensive combination of the three major areas (excluding textile) with surplus labor as the main focus, taking into account collective labor and unified profit distribution of funds, and established a unified leadership organization.

　　整顿三大结合经验
    巨林　讲文
    羊井底除两户外，全村都组织起来，成立三个互助大队十三个互助小组；以大队为单位，又有三个较大的小型合作社，拥有资本一百五十余万元，抽出固定劳力常年进行副业生产，在社支锅吃饭赚钱按劳二资八比例分红，各互助小组也灵活的抽人进行副业活动（卖杏运输等）。
    当锄苗第一遍结束以后，全村算变工帐，各小型合作社也算帐分红，脱离生产分红的副业人员（雇佣关系者除外）都吃了亏。如刘生财的小型合作社半年内分到红利九千元，就得出战勤变工米九斗，合市价一万四千多元，家里种地用工还欠下工资。这样，搞副业的人都不干了，小组的副业也出了问题，反映分红不合理，出外劳力分八成太沾光，地多的人也沾了光。这样全村副业生产（纺线除外）顿成消沉，小型合作社的驴也拴起来了，副业劳力停在家里，小组的副业活动（运输等）也不活跃了。
    情况发展以后，就向领导副业的同志访问，弄清并非副业生产无利可图，这样就召集了干部、副业干部、生产人员进行漫谈，发现消沉的主要原因。刘邦孩说：“去年分上红顶钱（物价低），啥也能顾住；今年分上还不够鞋钱哩！又出变工米，再干非赔干不行。”张则说：“咱干一天副业除吃白作了工，给咱种一天地三升米（除吃），工资就出不起。”二则说：“干了年半了，家八九亩地连把粪也弄不上，小地也不想做了，叫一工三升米，家贴干了还该人家五斗米工资，抽几千元红也零花消了（开支的意思），就得石把变工米。”又如连树说：“够变工米顾住吃穿就能干。”由此研究，主要原因是由于副业劳力与农业劳力没有变工，再加物价高分红少，副业劳力吃了亏；因此基本上应该在变工分红问题上解决这个问题，这样又启发大家怎样干。都说方向（办法）不变不能克服困难，就提出怎样变方向，让大家讨论；可是都信心不高，说咱想不出办法来，好干家（好把式的意思）顾一头（赚上钱顾了合作社的意思），歪干家两头误（家也顾不了合作社也干不了），还有说这才是功不成利不就哩！当时领导上就提出能创业就能守业，小型合作社是咱创造起来就能继续下去，“大家是诸葛，人多办法高”，咱是八仙过海，各显奇能，看谁的办法高，一定功要成利要成。就这样一鼓动，都说：“困难还能绊住咱。”经过一天时间在生活中的个别酝让，提出了两种办法：一种是农副战勤统一变工，各社不支锅立灶，变动分红办法；一种是或大或小，就是把小型合作或并一个大合作社，或把资金分到农业小组来进行副业活动。大家讨论合并到一块弄不通，资金分到小组就不能经常搞、赚大钱，行通的还是第一种办法。
    虽然提出了变的方向（办法），可是对变办法并不积极，有些副业人员干部，满足过去的支锅立灶铺张门面，思想抵抗，说：“研究半年也不算，把牲口卖了股金分了算吧！”村干部是怕麻烦，说变工费时哩，想干好全村非得三个研究两个会计天天脱离生产不行。以是用对比方法，举出武候利的小组，不支灶搞副业，在锄草中五个工赚一万，组员分盐分蒜又赚钱，很满意；××小型合作半年吃喝三十四万，搞副业的却出不起变工米，大家（指资金）分不上红。这样对比后才弄通了，并在支委曾提出谁先创造出来立一功。
    当干部思想弄通以后，摆在面前要考虑的问题是先创造典型推动一般呢？还是各队同时开展呢？我们估计了各队的基础条件，特别是争胜心理和我们的干部力量，认为有充分的全面开展条件，就全面干起来了，召开大队全村的群众大会，反复讨论研究，解决了许多群众思想。
    群众最关心的是怕吃亏，如对折工问题，农业劳力都说副业出一天折十分，将来比变工还厉害（他们特别怕副业赔钱）。副业劳力说：这连个嘴也顾不住了。干部就引导大家讨论，弄清搞副业的人折工不赚钱就不敢出误枉工，副业上赚工资分红，都是他们赚来的，背不了农业劳力。这样大家弄通了，说：这才是盼搞副业的多出去干哩，越出的多越多赚钱，大家越能多分红，他也能多分红。对副业劳力说明做一工顶一工，地也有人做了，不用出变工米，还能分红。最后清楚谁也不吃亏了，都说这才是一分劳力一分福哩，谁也加紧劳动。对资金（股金）问题，劳力分红的比例倒转了，变成劳八资二，所以群众想不通，说资金太吃亏，这样都要抽股了。在解决这个问题时，解释资金是死的，赚钱主要靠劳力，资金分红多就剥削了劳力。拿上三咀合作社去年一个组员入股金三万元，半年分红四万八千元，按当时市价能买米十五石。这样一算帐思想都弄通了。
    各队在互相竞争的情绪下，对具体办法上也有许多创造，如王俏队创造的运输按重量按里的折工办法（七十斤六十里十分），又灵活又简便。又如刘生财队为了刺激副业劳力每天的平均赚钱目，规定抽五成到三成的累进奖励，越多赚越多奖的办法，都非常好。
    前后经过八天的紧张工作，全村四个大队一九○户除两户外，都实行了农副战勤统一管理，统一评功，统一工票，统一算帐，以剩余劳力为主，照顾集体劳力与资金的统一分红全面的三大结合（除纺织），并建立了统一领导机构。
