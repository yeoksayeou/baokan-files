　　I. Four Black Dots Approached Us

　　Rain filled the trenches, the winding communication trenches resembled small rivers, and the soldiers were immersed in water, with only their heads exposed. Located just 150 meters from the highway, twenty-six eyes were keenly watching the road.

　　Whoosh… A sound, sometimes sharp and sometimes slow, came from the southeast. Was it a car or a plane? No one could tell. The sound grew closer and closer. Secretary Li Huachang stretched his head and looked towards the southern end of the long road. Four black dots, growing from distant specks, were driving towards them.

　　II. “Guaranteed Not to Lose Face”

　　“Tanks! Tanks!” the communicator shouted! He had already dealt with tanks in the Yigou interception battle. Squad Leader Wang Zhishan suddenly stood up, staring with curious eyes at the four tanks driving north, and said to the secretary, "So these are tanks! Hmm, not much! They move so slowly; I could crawl faster." The secretary responded, "If you dare to crawl, so do I." Wang Zhishan widened his eyes and said, "Anyone who doesn't dare is a wimp. Let's race." The tanks were getting closer and closer. The secretary said to everyone, "Let the tanks pass, then hit the infantry behind them, and then take care of the tanks." Liu Baoying from the Third Platoon suggested, "We should learn from the Third Company, which repelled eleven tanks in Xuangou." His mention reminded the comrades of the challenge letter from the Third Company. Yuan Yaoting shouted, "I guarantee to do well and not let our platoon lose face!"

　　III. The Enemy Abandoned Corpses and Fled.

　　One tank, then two tanks passed by. The enemy infantry followed cautiously behind, heads lowered.

　　Five hundred meters, three hundred meters, only one hundred meters left. The platoon deputy's Type 38 rifle let out a crisp sound. Light machine guns and rifles fired all at once, and the battle began.

　　The enemy formation was thrown into disarray by our rapid fire, but they relied on the cover of the tanks to charge at our Third Platoon. Wang Zhishan called on the whole squad to prepare grenades. As soon as the enemy came up, they were hit by a hail of grenades, thrown into chaos, and abandoned their corpses as they fled.

　　IV. “Look! It's Farting, It Can't Move!”

　　Seeing that the infantry had run into a wall, the tanks hurriedly turned around 180 degrees, opened full throttle, and tried to run south. The two in front slipped away, but one in the rear was stuck in the mud and couldn't move. New recruit Tao Zhiying happily shouted, "Look! It's farting, it can't move!" Another tank also stopped, turned around, and like a mad dog, fired wildly at the Third Platoon's position, trying to cover the one stuck in the mud, but it couldn't leave the road and could only fret anxiously.

　　The tank couldn't move, and the infantry dared not retreat. The commander drove the soldiers to launch a second attack, trying to drive us away. But, just like the first time, they were beaten back by the Third Platoon's brave men.

　　V. The Time to Earn Merit Has Arrived.

　　After two failed charges, the enemy dared not move recklessly again. They relied on fortifications and clung to the tanks. The cannon on the tank turret kept turning around and firing randomly, as if it were howling.

　　Yuan Yaoting, a new recruit from the liberation of Chengwu, stood up from the water, covered in water, and said, "You can earn merit at home in the Taihang Mountains, and I also want to earn merit at home. The tank can't move anymore, what are we waiting for!

　　Wang Zhishan said, "That's right! Comrades, the time to earn merit has arrived. We must charge! Charge!" With a loud shout, the whole platoon charged at the enemy like dragons emerging from the water. Yuan Yaoting took the lead, charging and shouting, "Third Company intercepts, Second Company surrounds." Just then, he was wounded. The squad leader told him to go down, but he insisted on not leaving the line of fire. The enemy was frightened by their heroic spirit. Vice machine gunner Chen Jinshan's machine gun stopped firing in bursts. He handed the machine gun to the ammunition handler to fix, and he charged forward with grenades. Machine gunner Wang Qingyun held his most reliable crooked-neck machine gun and fired four hundred rounds in one breath. The barrel was red-hot. He dipped it in water, picked it up, and fired again. The enemy didn't even have time to escape and were shot dead in the fortifications, five or six of them.

　　VI. Burning the Iron Tortoise.

　　Wang Zhishan, Liu Baoying, Li Huachang, and little communicator Qiu Zhifu were all charging in the front. The driver on the tank, seeing that the situation was not good, had already slipped away. Wang Zhishan ran over and heard the engine still rumbling inside. He happily shouted, "Come on! It's still alive!" They stuffed grenades one after another into the observation holes. The fuel tank caught fire. The No. 354 light American-made tank was burned red-hot. The No. 567 was intact and became a prize for the comrades of the Third Platoon."

　　Everyone touched the iron tortoise that America had sent to Chiang Kai-shek, smiling so much that they couldn't close their mouths!

　　活捉铁乌龟
    ——阻击一一九旅战斗中的特写
    郝宝璋
　　一、四个黑点向我们驶来。
    雨下满了工事，交通沟湾湾曲曲，好象一条小河，战士们全身浸在水里光露着一个头，这里距公路仅百五十米达，二十六只眼睛明溜溜地，瞅着汽路。
    呼呼……从东南传来了紧一阵，慢一阵的声音，是汽车，是飞机谁也分辨不清。声音，越来越近了，支书李华昌同志伸起头来，向这条漫长汽路南端望了望，四个黑点由远而近，向这里驶来了。
　　二、“保险丢不了鼻子”
    坦克！坦克！通信员这样喊！他在宜沟阻击战已和坦克打过交道了。七班长王志山忽然站起来用好奇的眼光，盯住向北驶来的四辆坦克，向支书说：“这就是坦克呀！嗯，球！走的这样慢，爬也爬上去了。”支书接口说：“你敢爬，我也敢爬。”王志山睁着两眼说：“谁不敢爬，就是孬孙，咱们两比赛。”坦克越来越近了，支书向大家说：“把坦克放过去，打它后面的步兵，再收拾坦克。”三排的刘保英提出：我们要向宣沟打退十一辆坦克的三连学习。经他一提，全班同志都记起了三连写来的挑战书，袁耀亭喊道：“我保险打好，不叫给咱们排丢了鼻子。”
　　三、敌人弃尸而逃了。
    一辆两辆坦克都放过去了，敌人步兵在后面缩头缩脑的紧跟着上来。
    五百米，三百米，只有一百米了，排副的那支三八式发出了清脆的叫声，轻机枪步枪，随着一齐开火了，战斗就这样展开。
    敌人队形在我短促火力杀伤下，混乱了，但是它凭着坦克的掩护向我三排冲过来了，王志山招呼全班把手榴弹准备好，敌人刚上来，就被雹子似的手榴弹，给打了个乱七八糟，弃尸而逃了。
　　四、“你看！嘟嘟直放屁，开也开不动啦！”
    坦克见步兵碰了钉子，慌忙转了个一百八十度的圈子，开足马力，想向南跑，前面的两辆溜走了，后面的一辆陷在泥沼里开不动。新战士陶志英高兴的叫：“你看！嘟嘟直放屁，开也开不走啦！”另一辆也停下来，转过头疯狗一样的向三排阵地上乱打炮乱扫射，企图掩护掉进泥里的那一辆，但他不能离开汽路一步只有那样干着急。
    坦克开不走，步兵也不敢退，指挥官驱使着士兵又进行第二次冲锋，想把我们赶走。但是它又和第一次一样被三排的勇士们给揍了回来。
　　五、立功的时候到了。
    两次冲锋遭到失败后，敌人不敢再蠢动了，就依据工事，固守坦克；坦克塔顶上的炮也不断向四周乱转乱放炮，好象是嚎叫的样子。
    城武解放来的新战士袁耀亭，从水里躬起来，浑身是水说：“你们能在太行山家门口上立功，我也要在家门口上立功，坦克已不能走了，还不冲等啥！
    王志山说：“对呀！同志们，立功的时候到了，我们要冲呀！冲呀！”一声大喊，全排象出水蛟龙一样向敌人猛冲过去，袁耀亭一马当先边冲边喊：“三连截住，二连包围。”正当这时他负伤了，班长叫他下去他们坚持不下火线，敌人被他们这种英勇精神吓昏了。机枪副班长陈金山的机枪打不连了，他把机枪交给弹药手收拾，自己提着手榴弹冲上前面来，机枪班长王庆云端着他最得手的歪把机枪，一股劲打了四百发子弹，枪筒烧红了，他放在水里沾一沾拿起来再打，敌人逃都来不及逃就被打死在工事里五六个。
　　六、火烧铁乌龟。
    王志山、刘保英、李华昌，还有小通讯员邱志福都冲在最前面，坦克上的架驶员，看见势头不对，早偷偷溜走了，王志山跑过去听见里面马达还在隆隆作响，他高兴的叫起来：“快来吧！还活着哩！”他们把手榴弹一个接一个的塞进了＠望孔，油箱起火了，３５４号轻型美式坦克被烧的通红，５６７号的一辆却完整无损地成了三排同志们的胜利品。”
    大家用手摸弄着这美国给蒋介石送来的铁乌龟，笑的连嘴都阖不住啦！
