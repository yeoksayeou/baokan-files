Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 23rd—UNRRA's cessation of relief north of 34 degrees north latitude in China, while continuing to unilaterally aid Chiang Kai-shek, has aroused deep dissatisfaction in the Chinese Liberated Areas. It is generally believed that this is a further public manifestation of UNRRA's consistent pro-Chiang stance. UNRRA in China has never adhered to its proclaimed principle of "fair and reasonable distribution of relief supplies regardless of political belief." As of the end of July, 98.7 percent of all materials shipped to China had been supplied to the Chiang government; the Liberated Areas, which suffered the most during the anti-Japanese war, received only 1.3 percent. In the past, UNRRA used the sabotage of the Chiang government to cover up its shameful trick of playing a duet with the Chiang government. This time, it even tries to shift the responsibility to both the government (Chiang) and the CCP. However, countless historical facts prove that it has always been the Chiang government that has sabotaged UNRRA's relief work in the Liberated Areas, while it has always been the CCP and the entire military and civilians of the Liberated Areas that have assisted UNRRA's work. For example, in mid-June of this year, when a batch of UNRRA supplies arrived at Yangjiaogou in Shandong, Chiang's planes bombed the area for three consecutive days, destroying most of the unloaded supplies and killing and injuring many transferring sailors. When the relief ship returned to Yantai, Chiang's planes followed and bombed Yantai. In February of this year, UNRRA personnel Hansen and others escorted a batch of supplies to Zhangqiu Town in the Hebei-Shandong-Henan Liberated Area, and were also subjected to indiscriminate bombing by Chiang's planes, and UNRRA vehicles were also destroyed. On the 25th of the same month, a UNRRA vehicle transporting supplies from Yantai to Qixia was bombed and destroyed by Chiang's planes, and the driver was injured. Other UNRRA unloading docks, such as Shijiusuo (belonging to Rizhao County, Shandong), were frequently attacked by Chiang's planes and warships, resulting in countless losses. As for the plundering of relief supplies to the Liberated Areas by Chiang's puppets, there are countless examples. For example, on July 27, Chiang's warships intercepted seven ships transporting UNRRA supplies near Longkou, seizing 179 tons of supplies. In June of last year, 400,000 catties of supplies escorted by UNRRA's An Dingyuan to the Taihang Liberated Area were all looted by the Chiang puppet army Duan Bingchang's troops when they arrived in Qin County. In August of last year, the Chiang army's 8th Army attacked Guangrao City and looted 2,500 bags of UNRRA relief flour. Developing to early July of this year, the Chiang government blatantly used the blockade of the ports of the Liberated Areas and the order for UNRRA personnel to withdraw from the Liberated Areas as a means to completely monopolize relief supplies as capital for the civil war. Its sabotage of relief work in the Liberated Areas is even more evident. However, the government of the Liberated Areas, on the contrary, has always assisted UNRRA's work with all its strength, so that the meager supplies obtained can be quickly and fairly distributed to the rescued. The military and civilians of the Liberated Areas have taken great care of UNRRA personnel, even in war situations, and even when UNRRA's treatment of the Liberated Areas is extremely unfair, there has never been an exception. For example, during the liberation of Cangxian County in June of this year, the People's Liberation Army escorted the UNRRA personnel there to a safe area in advance. As soon as the fighting stopped, they were sent back to their original places to work. This is recognized and praised by UNRRA personnel and foreign reporters who have been to the Liberated Areas, and UNRRA cannot erase these historical facts. If UNRRA has a little bit of fairness, then the Chiang government should be the one whose relief is stopped, and the Liberated Areas should be the one whose relief is strengthened; but today it is just the opposite. UNRRA colludes with the Chiang government to discriminate against the Liberated Areas, which appears in a clever disguise. For example, everyone knows that the Chiang government has always relied on UNRRA in a humble and smiling manner, but Chiang's planes "dare to" bomb UNRRA's vehicles and ships; UNRRA and the Executive Yuan jointly stipulated that Yantai, Yangjiaogou and other places in Shandong should be distribution bases, and allowed the Chiang-appointed Ministry of National Defense to issue orders for "protection," but it was precisely these places that became the targets of Chiang's planes; UNRRA and the Executive Yuan jointly stipulated the marks of UNRRA ships and vehicles, but it was these marked vehicles and ships that were bombed every time. Moreover, UNRRA sent supplies there, and bombed there. According to the basic agreement on UNRRA's work in China, UNRRA has the right to stop the Chiang side from this destructive crime, but regardless of the repeated requests and protests from the government and people of the Liberated Areas, UNRRA has never made any effective prevention. On the contrary, the Chiang side's sabotage has always been used by UNRRA as an excuse to transfer or suspend relief supplies to the Liberated Areas. Moreover, when the Chiang government announced the blockade of all ports in the Liberated Areas, preventing relief supplies from entering the area, UNRRA not only did not protest, but instead sang a duet, announcing the cessation of relief north of 34 degrees north latitude in China. In fact, UNRRA and the Chiang government have been colluding for a long time. After the relief ship "Wan Shan" was bombed in Shijiusuo on April 2nd of this year, it took the excuse of air defense and transferred supplies to Qingdao and Tianjin. UNRRA also withdrew its personnel stationed in Yantai for a time. In mid-June, Yangjiaogou was bombed, and the relief ship "Wan Ci" and others far away in Yantai were ordered to stop unloading and left Yantai in a hurry. After Zhangqiu Town was bombed in February, all UNRRA personnel withdrew. In view of the Chiang-appointed Executive Yuan's various acts of swallowing, deducting, embezzling, stealing, exchanging, and destroying relief supplies to the Liberated Areas, the Liberated Areas have repeatedly proposed to reorganize the Executive Yuan, with representatives from the Liberated Areas participating, or for UNRRA to directly engage with the Liberated Areas, and for the reasonable request for relief supplies to the Liberated Areas to be transported directly to the Liberated Areas without passing through the Chiang-controlled areas, but UNRRA firmly refused to accept. As a result, the supplies transported to the Liberated Areas were all dilapidated and unusable. The above-mentioned things have also aroused opposition from many fair-minded people within UNRRA, but they have all been rejected. This is the true face of UNRRA. UNRRA recently suggested "designating Yantai as a demilitarized zone and a ceasefire in the section from Tianjin to Botou." The public is very surprised by this, because most of Yantai and the section from Tianjin to Botou are in the Liberated Areas and are already very peaceful. As long as the Chiang army does not invade, there is no such thing as military or war. However, the Associated Press reported on the 21st of this month that the Chiang government is planning to attack Yantai with the army and navy, so the clues here make people unable to doubt whether there is a close military cooperation between UNRRA and Chiang Kai-shek. The people of the Liberated Areas said that they have overcome countless difficulties without relying on any foreign aid, but they do not reject any friendly assistance. They oppose hypocritical deception, and even more oppose unilaterally supporting the traitorous and dictatorial Chiang government in the name of relief to slaughter the patriotic people of the Liberated Areas.

### 与蒋贼串谋停止救济解放区　联总袒蒋面貌更丑恶

　　与蒋贼串谋停止救济解放区
  　联总袒蒋面貌更丑恶
    【新华社陕北二十三日电】联总停止中国境内北纬三十四度以北之救济，继续片面援蒋，已在中国解放区引起深刻的不满。一般认为这是联总一贯袒蒋的进一步公开表露。联总在华，从未遵守其所宣称的“不分政治信仰公平合理分配救济物资”的原则。截至七月底止，全部运华物资的百分之九十八点七都供给了蒋政府；在抗日期中受灾难最重的解放区，所得仅为百分之一点三。联总过去曾经利用蒋政府的破坏，来掩饰其与蒋政府唱双簧的可耻技俩，这次竟想把责任同时诿诸中共方面，妄谓此“应归咎于政府（蒋）及中共双方”。但是无数史实证明，历来破坏联总对解放区救济工作的，只是蒋政府，而始终协助联总工作的，则是中共与解放区全体军民。比如今年六月中旬，联总一批物资运抵山东羊角沟时，蒋机即在该地连炸三日，使已卸之大部物资被毁，并死伤转运船员多人。当救济船折回烟台时，蒋机又跟炸到烟台。今年二月，联总人员韩森等押运一批物资抵冀鲁豫解放区张秋镇，亦连遭蒋机滥炸，联总汽车亦被毁。同月二十五日，联总汽车由烟台运送物资去栖霞途中，被蒋机炸毁，司机负伤。其他如石臼所（山东日照县属）等联总卸货码头，更经常遭到蒋机蒋舰的袭扰，损失无算。至于蒋伪封解放区救济物资的劫掠，更是举不胜举。如七月二十七日，蒋舰于龙口附近海面一次截劫解总转运联总物资船七只，劫去物资一百七十九吨。去年六月，由联总安定远氏押送至太行解放区之四十万斤物资，运抵沁县时，即为蒋伪军段炳昌部全部抢去。去年八月，蒋军第八军袭入广饶城，抢去联总救济面粉二千五百袋。发展到今年七月初旬，蒋政府竟悍然以封锁解放区港口及限令联总人员自解放区撤退为手段，借以全部垄断救济物资充作内战资本。其破坏对解放区的救济工作，更加昭明彰著。但解放区政府则与此相反，始终以全力协助联总工作，使所得极少的物资均能迅速而公平地分配到被救济者手中。解放区军民对于联总人员的爱护备至，即使在战争场合，及联总对解放区待遇极不公平的情况下，亦从无例外。如今年六月解放沧县之役，解放军事先将该处联总人员护送至安全地带，战斗一停，即送其返回原地工作。这是来过解放区的联总人员与外国记者所公认并赞扬者，联总是无法抹煞这些史实的。联总如稍存公道，则被停止救济的应该是蒋政府，被加强救济的应该是解放区；但今天却恰恰相反，联总与蒋政府串谋歧视解放区，是以一种巧妙的伪装出现。例如：谁都知道蒋政府是历来卑躬笑脸地仰赖联总的，但蒋机却“敢于”轰炸联总的车船；联总和行总会共同规定山东烟台、羊角沟等处为发放基地，并允由蒋记国防部通令“保护”，但成为蒋机轰炸目标的，就正是这些地方；联、会共同规定联总船车的标志，但每次被炸的，就这种有标志的车船。并且，联总把物资送到那里，就跟踪炸到那里。根据联总在华时的工作基本协定，联总是有权制止蒋方这种破坏罪行的，但是不管解放区政府与人民的多次要求和抗议，联总却从未作过任何有效的制止。相反的，蒋方的破坏，一贯被联总用来作为转运或停运解放区救济物资的口。而且蒋政府宣布封锁解放区一切港口，阻止救济物资进入区时，联总不惟未加抗议，反而令唱双簧，宣布停止中国境内北纬卅四度以北之救济。事实上联总与蒋政府狼狈为奸由来已久，为救济轮“万善号”于今年四月二日在石臼所被炸后，即借口防空，将物资转卸青岛、天津。联总并一度撤退驻烟（台）人员。六月中旬，羊角沟被炸，远在烟台之救济轮“万慈号”等，即奉命停止卸货，全部匆匆离烟。二月张秋镇被炸后，联总人员随之全部撤退。鉴于蒋记行总封解放区物资的百般吞灭、克扣、贪污、盗换、破坏行为，解放区方面曾多次提出改组行总，由解总派员参加，或由联总直接与解总发生关系，救济解放区物资不经过蒋管区直接运来解放区的合理要求，但联总坚不接受。结果，运来解放区的物资，都是一些破烂不堪的东西。上述种种，即在联总内部也曾经引起不少公正人士的反对，但他们一一都遭到了排斥。这就是联总的本来面目。联总最近还建议“将烟台划为非军事区，天津至泊头一段停战，”舆论界对此不胜诧异，因为烟台和天津到泊头一段之大部都在解放区，本来就很和平，只要蒋军不进犯，就根本无所谓军事或战争可言。但美联社本月二十一日发布消息，谓蒋府正图以陆海军进攻烟台，则此间蛛丝马迹，颇令人不能无疑于联总与蒋介石之间，究竟有无军事上密切配合的勾搭。解放区人民表示，他们不曾依赖过任何外援克服了无数的困难，但他们也不拒绝任何友谊的救助。他们反对伪善的欺骗，更反对以救济为名，片面支援卖国独裁的蒋政府，屠杀解放区爱国的人民。
