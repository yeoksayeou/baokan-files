　　【Tangyin News from Our Newspaper】After a thorough rain in Dahu Village, Second District of Tangyin, cadres and the masses generally developed a paralyzing and侥幸 mentality of fantasizing about a bumper harvest. Some cadres started smoking paper cigarettes again, and the masses changed back to noodles and pancakes, saying, "This looks promising, why bother being thrifty?" Some individual households even fed the harvested wild vegetables to the cattle. An old man said, "This rain is just the beginning, it will keep raining from now on, take your time planting, don't panic. I remember in the year of Guangxu, it rained on the 18th day of the eighth month, and each mu still yielded one dan." The village cadres also breathed a sigh of relief and said, "It's time for us to rest for a few days!" They also became passive in leading production, saying, "The common people know more about planting than we do, why do we need to lead them!" After discovering this, the leadership immediately convened a meeting of village cadres, explaining that although it had rained, many newly turned-over households had not yet established a solid foundation, and some of the masses were still without food. Even if the late-planted crops caught seedlings, if we did not fertilize and weed properly, we would still have a poor harvest. They inspired everyone to continue implementing thrift and leading the masses in the enthusiasm for production and thrift. Then, a mass meeting was held to allow everyone to discuss and analyze this year's harvest. Zhao Wancheng said, "We planted late this year, the time is short, even if the weather is favorable, we will still have a reduced harvest." Everyone calculated the accounts. The whole village has 48 qing of land, and if each mu yields five dou less, it will be a total reduction of 24,000 shi. If each mu yields seven dou less (which is very possible), it will be a reduction of 33,600 shi. The whole village still has 12 qing of wasteland that has not been planted, which is another reduction of 8,400 shi. The whole village has 900 people, and each person will have 466 jin less to eat. How can we get by without thrift? Communist Party member Wang Shuangquan said, "We have just turned over, and there is no surplus grain at home. If it were under the Kuomintang, we would have starved to death. Now, with the leadership of our Communist Party, as long as we work hard and be thrifty, we are not afraid." He announced his own thrift plan to everyone and expressed his willingness to actively lead everyone to implement production and thrift. Everyone unanimously expressed their willingness to no longer waste under his leadership and to step up production. (Zhang Chengguo)

　　汤阴二区大胡村
  　幻想丰收不对大家继续节约
    【本报汤阴讯】二区大胡村普落透雨后，干部群众普遍产生了幻想丰收麻痹侥幸思想，有些干部又吸开纸烟，群众又改成面条烙饼，并说：“这可有指望了，还用俭省？”还有个别户把打下的野菜喂了牛，一个老汉说：“这雨下开了头，以后就不断下呀，慢慢种吧，慌啥，我记得光绪那一年八月十八日下了雨，每亩还收了一石。”村干部也松了口气说：“这可该咱歇几天哩！”对生产也领导消极了，说：“耩地事老百姓比咱懂的多，还用咱领导哩！”领导上发现后，当即召开村干部会议，说明虽然下了雨，许多新翻身户富根没扎稳，一部分群众当前即无饭吃，晚种庄稼虽然捉住苗，如我们不好好施肥锄苗，更要歉收，启发大家继续贯彻节约和领导群众生产节约的积极性。接着又开群众大会，让大家讨论分析今年的收成，赵万成说：“今年咱们种的晚，时间短了，就是风调雨顺也要减收。”大家都算开了帐，全村四十八顷土地，每亩如果少收五斗，就共少收二万四千石，如每亩少收七斗（是很可能的），少收三万三千六百石哩，全村还有十二顷荒地没种上，又少收八千四百石，全村九百口人，每口就少吃四百六十六斤，再不节约还能行？共产党员王双全说：“咱们刚翻了身，家里没有余粮，要国民党在时咱们非饿死不行，现在有咱共产党领导，只要劳动节约就不怕”，并给大家宣布了自己的节约计划，同时表示愿意积极领导大家贯彻生产节约，大家一致表示愿在他领导下不再浪费，加紧生产。　（张成国）
