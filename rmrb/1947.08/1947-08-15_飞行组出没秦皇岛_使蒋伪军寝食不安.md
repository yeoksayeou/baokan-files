　　Flying Squad Haunts Qinhuangdao
　　Making Chiang's Puppet Troops Uneasy
　　Ge Yuan
　　A people's guerrilla force is active near Qinhuangdao, that is, the Lin Hai Flying Squad, which makes Chiang's puppets uneasy. The squad leader is named Jianguo, who was a brave guerrilla during the Japanese occupation, often appearing in the strongholds around the city, such as Changcheng Coal Mine, Shimen, and Haiyang. After Chiang's army, under the cover of the U.S. military, invaded Shanhaiguan, Qinhuangdao, and other places at the end of 1945, this people's armed force was quickly established under the leadership of guerrilla fighters from the Japanese occupation era. In August of last year, a large Chiang army passed through Liujiahe Station in Qinhuangdao to attack the Liberated Area. Just as a regiment had passed, the Jianli Flying Squad, hiding in the sorghum fields, saw two Chiang soldiers pushing a cart coming from behind. They suddenly fired a shot head-on, and the two guys dropped the supplies and ran away. Jianguo then rode the captured mule and disappeared into the sorghum fields again. Before long, a large group of enemies came over, and they saw small red flags with "Beware of Landmines" planted everywhere. The enemies were suspicious and hesitant. They had only taken ten steps when there was a loud bang and two of them fell to the ground. The Chiang soldiers next to them shouted, "Don't be afraid, go around, go through the open space!" Before he could finish speaking, there was another bang at his feet, and he was blown up. The enemies then ran back to Haiyang in a panic. The Flying Squad actively cooperated with the main force of the Liberation Army in combat. This spring, when they ambushed the Mafang stronghold three miles outside Qinhuangdao, and during the summer Lodong campaign to capture Shimensai, the Flying Squad provided valuable intelligence and led the way.

　　飞行组出没秦皇岛
  　使蒋伪军寝食不安
    戈原
    在秦皇岛附近活跃着一支人民的游击队，那就是使蒋伪寝食不安的临海飞行组，组长名叫建国，在日本鬼子统治时代就是一个英勇的游击队员，经常出没在市周围长城煤矿、石门、海阳等据点间。一九四五年底蒋军在美军的掩护下，侵占山海关、秦皇岛等地后，这一支人民武装就在日本统治时代游击队员领导下，很迅速成立起来。去年八月间，大队蒋军经过秦皇岛的刘家河车站向解放区进攻，一个团刚走过去，伏在青纱帐里的建立飞行组，看见后面两个蒋军押着大车走来，突然迎头一枪，那两个家伙丢下物资跑掉了，建国便骑着缴来的骡子，又钻进青纱帐里去。不一会一面大队敌人又过来了，只见遍地插着“小心地雷”的小红旗。敌人疑惑不定，走不上十来步轰的一声躺倒了两个，旁边的蒋军忙叫：“不怕，绕着路走，走这空地方！”话犹未了，又轰的一声在他脚下开了花，于是敌人屁滚尿流跑回海阳。飞行组对于解放队主力部队作战，积极配合，今春偷袭秦皇岛外三里的马坊据点及夏季泺东战役攻克石门塞时，飞行组都供给了有价值的情报，并在前面带路。
