　　Emerald Green Fields Ringing
  　Emancipated Peasants Busy Irrigating
    [Report from Jinnan by our newspaper on the 11th] "Emerald green fields ringing, emancipated peasants busy irrigating." This is the scene of production in Yaoshan since the beginning of summer. Hu Lao Zhu's mutual aid team in Dongqian Village has twenty-five mu of high land, far from the well, making it difficult to use a pulley to draw water. So they pooled money to buy a waterwheel. Hu Laoqi and several others raised 130,000 yuan to buy one. Hu Laoqi said, "Without mutual aid, no one could afford it, but buying together makes it easy for everyone. Now that we have a waterwheel, we must hurry to irrigate. Irrigating these twenty-five mu of land well will surely yield an extra fifteen shi of grain." The masses in Guo Yuan organized eleven mutual aid teams. All the waterwheels and pulleys work day and night, irrigating five hundred mu of land in ten days. After weeding twice, they replanted 56,000 mu. Women in Nanwei Village work as hard as men. Chen Zixiang's group of four women, with two pulleys, irrigate three and a half mu of land a day. They are all happy, saying, "We are no worse than men!"

  　翻身农民浇地忙
    【本报冀南十一日电】“碧绿田野叮当响，翻身农民浇地忙。”这是入夏以来尧山的生产景象。东佥村胡老祝互助组，有高地二十五亩，距井远，用辘辘浇水费劲。于是便凑钱买水车，胡老齐等数人，集资十三万元买到一架，胡老起说：“要不互助，谁也买不起，伙买就都不作难；这时咱有了水车，要赶紧浇呀，二十五亩地浇好，准能多打粮食十五石。”郭园群众组织了十一个互助组，所有水车辘辘昼夜不停，十天浇地五百亩。他们锄完二遍，补苗五万六千亩。南魏村妇女和男子一样干活，陈子香组四个妇女，两把辘辘一天浇地三亩半，她们都很高兴的说：“咱们比男人一点也不差呀！”
