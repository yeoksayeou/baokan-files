Xinhua News Agency, Shandong, 11th. The declaration of the establishment of the Liangguang Column of the Chinese People's Liberation Army states: In order to accelerate the end of Chiang Kai-shek's reactionary dictatorial rule and realize a truly peaceful and democratic united government as soon as possible, we have formed the Liangguang Column of the Chinese People's Liberation Army on the East China battlefield. The declaration introduces the members of the column, stating: Our column includes the entire Dongjiang Column, which retreated north last year for the sake of domestic peace, revolutionary fighters and patriotic youths who have struggled in the liberated areas for many years, patriotic overseas Chinese, and Kuomintang officers and soldiers from Liangguang who have been liberated from the Kuomintang army. After announcing the column's determination to fight the reactionary Chiang-American clique to the end, the declaration calls on compatriots in Liangguang, overseas Chinese, and Kuomintang officers and soldiers in Liangguang to work together in the sacred mission of opposing Chiang-America and liberating China and Liangguang. The declaration states: Compatriots and democrats in Liangguang, Chiang Kai-shek, in order to save his dying fate, has promulgated the heinous "General Mobilization Order," further forcing money and lives from you and compatriots in all Chiang-controlled areas, brutally suppressing and arresting you, causing you to suffer inhuman pain. You have no other way out but to rise up and save yourselves. We sympathize with and care for you. On the East China battlefield, we resolutely eliminate Chiang Kai-shek's invading army to actively support your heroic struggle against civil war and famine. We hope that you will persist and launch broader struggles against donations, taxes, and conscription. When the People's Liberation Army launches a full-scale counter-offensive, we will fight back and liberate the people of Liangguang together with you. Overseas Chinese, you love the motherland and have strongly supported the Dongjiang Column, South China, and the national War of Resistance Against Japan. You must fight to the end for the independence and freedom of the motherland. We will respond to you with victory. Kuomintang officers and soldiers in Liangguang, how many of the hundreds of thousands of strong men in Liangguang remain today? Chiang Kai-shek forces you to leave your hometowns, your wives and children separated, and to be cannon fodder for him. We hope that you will make a decisive decision, resolutely withdraw from the civil war, or lay down your weapons, or revolt on the battlefield, and work with us to fight back to our hometowns! This is not only your glory, but you will also be welcomed and treated preferentially by the people.
