Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 10th. London dispatch: The British economic crisis, triggered by the depletion of dollars and the coal shortage, has caused turmoil within the Labor government. In recent days, the heads of the Labor government have been busy meeting to urgently devise countermeasures. They have now formulated "emergency measures" to overcome the economic crisis, which were announced by Prime Minister Attlee in the House of Commons on the afternoon of the 6th. Attlee called these emergency measures a new "Second War" plan. Attlee's statement lasted seventy-seven minutes. According to the Associated Press: "Crowds gathered outside the House of Commons and at 10 Downing Street, waiting to hear what new sacrifices the dire state of the British national economy would require of them, just as they did during the days of wartime crisis; many small citizens were filled with the worst fears." Attlee declared that Britain was in a "state of danger and anxiety," and that the current severity was due to a large number of unprecedented factors "developing uncontrollably." Not only was "the recovery of Europe much slower than expected," but the Anglo-American financial agreement, which Britain had hoped to use to overcome its difficulties, had a rather painful effect on Britain. Attlee stated that after the loan agreement was signed, the United States lifted price controls, resulting in an average increase of 40 percent in the price of British "imports from the United States, and another 20 percent since the loan began to be drawn down." In the past year, Britain spent 3.24 billion US dollars, including 500 million US dollars in Canadian loans. Britain's foreign exchange deficit in 1946 was 350 million pounds, while the dollar deficit in the first half of 1947 alone reached 405 million pounds. The US loan now has only 1 billion US dollars left, which not only failed to "overcome Britain's dollar foreign exchange deficit before 1950" as originally expected, but even "finds it difficult to get through the end of this year." Now Britain's "final reserves are 600 million pounds" (calculated at 4 US dollars per pound). Attlee said黯然: "As borrowing decreases, the country's obligations under the loan increase instead." Therefore, he has asked the United States to amend the harsh terms imposed on Britain by the financial agreement. Next, Attlee announced the Labor government's "economic measures." The main significance of these measures lies in "self-reliance." Attlee declared: "The Marshall Plan may enable the United States to further assist the world's recovery, and we will share those assistances; but we cannot and will not base our plan on that assumption, we must increase our total production in order to be self-reliant as soon as possible." Among the economic measures announced by Attlee, it is stipulated that the industrial output in 1948 should reach 150 percent of that in 1938, and the domestic food production should be increased by 20 percent in 1951-52. The plan is to increase exports by 106 percent of the 1938 level by the end of 1948. In order to save US dollar foreign exchange, the plan is to reduce the import of luxury goods, timber, Hollywood movies, and one-sixth of food, etc., from October 1st. Attlee also announced that he would further control wages and increase miners' extra work by half an hour per day. Attlee said: "I call on the workers not to insist on increasing wages and improving living conditions, and I ask employers not to entice workers away from important jobs." Attlee announced the restoration of the "Wartime Control of Employment Act"; according to this law, workers who leave their jobs without permission will be punished, the most severe being two years' imprisonment and a fine of 500 pounds. "Sacrificing" workers' "individual freedom" and adopting "Spartan hardship" (Associated Press language) as "the necessary price for the rebirth" of the British Empire. From this point of view, the main burden of this so-called "economic war" is to be borne by British workers. Attlee also mentioned reducing the army; it is said that by the end of March next year, the British overseas army will be reduced from the current 500,000 to less than 300,000, and by the end of this year, 133,000 people will be transferred back, and 34,000 troops who have been supplied by Britain rather than English troops will be demobilized at the end of the year. At present, the total British army is about 1.3 million, and it will be reduced to 1.07 million by the end of March next year. Attlee emphasized: "Despite this accelerated withdrawal, there will be no changes in British foreign policy and the defense policy that supports it."

### 英美财政协定对英毫无效用　英国经济危机来临  艾德礼图压榨工人以渡难关

　　英美财政协定对英毫无效用
  　英国经济危机来临
    艾德礼图压榨工人以渡难关
    【新华社陕北十日电】伦敦讯：因美元枯竭与煤荒所促成的英国经济危机，曾引起工党内阁的风雨飘摇。旬日来，工党政府首脑忙于开会，急谋对策，现已制定为克服经济危机而采取的“紧急措施”，已于六日下午由艾德礼首相在下院宣布。艾德礼称此紧急措施为新的“第二战争”方案。艾德礼的声明历时七十七分钟。据美联社称：当时“下院外面及唐宁街十号招集着群众，他们就象战时危机时日中那样，等待着听取英国国民经济的惨境要求他们作什么样的新的牺牲；很多小市民都充满了最坏的恐惧。”艾德礼宣称：英国是处在“危险与焦虑的状态中”，目前的严重性，是由于大量前所未见的因素“发展得无法控制”所致。不仅“欧洲的复兴比预期的慢得多”，而且英国原指望借以渡过难关的英美财政协定，其对英国之效用则颇为惨痛。艾氏称，贷款协定签字后，美国取消了物价管制。以致英国“自美输入价格平均上涨了百分之四十，在贷款开始提用以来又上涨了百分之二十”。过去一年间英国计花掉美元三十二亿四千万元，其中包括加拿大贷款五亿元。一九四六年英外汇亏绌计三亿五千镑，而一九四七年上半年美元亏绌即达四亿零五百万镑。美国贷款现仅剩十亿元，不仅未能如原先预期“在一九五○年前克服英国美元外汇之亏绌”，甚至“目前竟难渡过今年年底”。现在英国“最后的储备到六亿镑”（按一镑合四美元）。艾氏黯然称：“借款日益减少，国家在借款下所负之义务则反形加重。”因此他已要求美方修改财政协定所加予英国的苛重条款。接着，艾德礼宣布工党政府的“经济措施。”这些措施的主要意义在于“自力更生”，艾德礼宣称：“马歇尔计划可能使美国更进一步援助世界复兴，而我们将共享那些援助；但我们不能而且也不会把我们的计划建基于那个假想之上，我们必须增加我们的总生产量，以便尽快的自力更生。”艾氏宣布的经济措施中规定：一九四八年工业产量要达到一九三八年的百分之一百五十，一九五一——五二年要增加国内食粮生产百分之二十。计划在一九四八年年底要增加出口额为一九三八年的百分之一○六。为节省美元外汇，计划自十月一日起减少购奢侈品、木材、好莱坞影片及六分之一的食粮等之入口。艾德礼并宣布将进一步管制工资，并于每日增加矿工额外工作半小时。艾氏称：“我呼吁工人们不要坚持增加工资与改善生活条件，我要求雇主们不要把工人从重要的工作中引诱出来。”艾氏宣布重新恢复“战时管制雇用劳工法”；按照此项法案，在业工人未经允许擅离职守者，将受处罚，最重者为两年监禁与五百镑罚金。“牺牲”工人“个人自由”，以“斯巴达式的艰苦”（美联社语）来作为大英帝国“再生的必须付出的代价”。由此看来，这次所谓“经济战争”的主要重荷，是由英国工人来负担。艾德礼也讲到要缩减军队；据称，在明年三月底以前，英国海外军队将自现在的五十万减至不足三十万，而在本年底以前，将调回十三万三千人，并将迄今由英国供给而非英的军队三万四千人于年底时解甲归田。目前全部英军约一百三十万人，明年三月底将减至一百万零七千人。艾氏强调称：“虽有此种加速撤军之措施，英外交政策以及支持外交政策之国防政策，俱无变更。”
