Xinhua News Agency, Central China, 21st: In the Yancheng battle, the militia of each county participating in the war set up a net of justice, and more than 3,000 Chiang Kai-shek's "Homecoming Corps" were all captured. Nearly 10,000 "Homecoming Corps" were originally gathered in the city. More than 5,500 people have repented and returned after persuasion. After the People's Liberation Army broke through Yeting (Yancheng) city, the militia poured into the streets and alleys like a tide, shouting and catching everywhere, scaring the "Homecoming Corps" out of their wits. All those hiding and posing as civilians were searched out one by one. Liu Xianpei, the county magistrate of Yancheng under Chiang Kai-shek, was also found by the militia hiding in a messy grass outside the north gate. At that time, Liu was covered in stinky water. The masses surrounded him and ridiculed him, saying, "Your prestige is over now!" The militiamen pointed angrily at Liu's nose and said, "Escape, see if we won't catch you even if you escape to the ends of the earth!"

Xinhua News Agency, Central China, 21st: During the Yeting (Yancheng) battle, all corps of the People's Liberation Army consciously implemented the political department's orders of "saving civilian manpower", "strictly implementing the policy on prisoners", and "protecting urban industry and commerce". Lightly wounded and sick soldiers were not allowed to use stretchers. After the war, a centralized inspection was conducted to check whether the personal belongings of the prisoners were lost. Five captured officers left their belongings in the barracks. The People's Liberation Army soldiers accompanied them to retrieve them. A Chiang Kai-shek army battalion commander gave a gold ring to Wang Jianqiu, a soldier of the People's Liberation Army, but Wang solemnly refused. Zhang Ziliang, the company commander of the Chiang Kai-shek army's Third Regiment, was wounded. Song, the deputy section chief of a certain unit of the People's Liberation Army, ordered a stretcher to be carried to the dressing station for treatment, and Zhang was moved to tears. After entering the city, each unit set up a security zone according to the original combat area and established a registration office for victory products. In addition to searching for military supplies, the property of the "Homecoming Corps" and Chiang's puppet regime were handed over to the local democratic government for disposal.

Xinhua News Agency, Central China, 21st: In the Yeting (Yancheng) liberation battle, a certain unit of the Central China People's Liberation Army first entered the city and won the title of "Yeting Unit" according to the order issued by the political department of a certain unit of the People's Liberation Army before the battle. The head of the unit personally directed the attack in order to win this glorious title. At dawn on the 12th, the unit's artillery first showed its power. Dozens of cannons fired intensively, and the rain of bullets fell directly on the city walls, destroying the key positions of the enemy's three-story bunkers. The engineers built a pontoon bridge in seven minutes, and the infantry assault team quickly crossed the city river and broke through the south gate, and cooperated with other units to wipe out the remaining enemies in the city, and finally completed the combat mission victoriously first.

Xinhua News Agency, Central China, 21st: The Political Department of the Northern Jiangsu Military Region recently expressed its condolences and commended the frontline reporters who went deep into the front line for interviews during the Yeting (Yancheng) liberation battle, saying that Comrade Hu Jie was injured in two places on his right arm and left chest while following the People's Liberation Army assault troops in the city attack. Reporters Dai Huang and Chen Qinglun entered and exited the hail of bullets and interviewed the heroic deeds of Chiang Kai-shek's self-defense war on the spot. This department hereby expresses its condolences.

  　活捉“还乡团”三千多
    【新华社华中二十一日电】叶挺（盐城）城战役中各县参战民兵布下天罗地网，蒋记“还乡团”三千余人全部就擒。该城原集结“还乡团”近万人，经劝告悔悟来归者已有五千五百余人。解放军攻破叶挺城后，民兵即如潮水涌进大街小巷，处处喊捉，吓得“还乡团”们魂不附体，所有躲藏及冒充民夫的均被一一搜出。蒋记盐城县长刘先沛潜藏北门外一乱草丛中也被民兵搜获。当时刘一身臭水淋漓，群众围着他嘲笑道：“这下子威风可完了吧！”民兵们则怒指刘的鼻子说：“逃，看你逃到天边也要捉住你的！”
    【新华社华中廿一日电】叶挺城（盐城）战役中解放军各兵团自觉执行政治部颁发之“节约民力”、“严格执行俘虏政策”、“保护城市工商业”等命令，轻伤、病员一律不用担架，战后集中检查俘虏私人物件有无损失。某五个被俘军官将东西丢在营房，解放军战士即陪同前往携取。蒋军一营长以金戒指送解放军战士王剑秋，被王严正拒绝。蒋军三团连长张子良负伤，解放军某部宋副科长即令担架抬往包扎所医治，张感动得声泪俱下。进城后各部队依原作战区域分区警戒，设立胜利品登记处，除搜索军用品外，“还乡团”及蒋伪财产均交当地民主政府处理。
    【新华社华中二十一日电】叶挺城（盐城）解放战中，华中蒋后人民解放军某部队首先入城，依解放军某部政治部战斗前颁发之命令荣获“叶挺部队”称号。该部首长为争取此光荣称号，曾亲自下营指挥进攻，十二日拂晓该部炮兵首先施展神威，数十门炮密集开火，弹雨直落城垣，摧毁敌三层碉堡的重点阵地，工兵在七分钟内架好浮桥，步兵突击队迅速越过了城河突破南门，并配合其他部队肃清城内残敌，终于最先胜利完成战斗任务。
    【新华社华中二十一日电】苏北军区政治部顷慰问表扬在叶挺城（盐城）解放战中深入火线采访的前线记者称：胡捷同志随解放军攻城突击部队冲锋前进，不幸右臂、左胸两处负伤。记者戴煌、陈清伦两同志则出入枪林弹雨，实地采访蒋自卫战争的壮烈事迹。本部特致慰问。
