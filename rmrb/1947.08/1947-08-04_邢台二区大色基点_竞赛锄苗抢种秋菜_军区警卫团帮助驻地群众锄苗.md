[Report from this newspaper, Xingtai] The Second District held an enlarged cadre meeting at Dase Village the other day, deciding to mobilize the masses to plant three-tenths of a mu of radish and vegetable per person, weed the spring seedlings four times, and eliminate weeds from the edges and ends of the fields. At that time, each village implemented a challenge system. The Sujiatun Village cadre, after accepting the challenge, returned to the village and convened a mass meeting that night, explaining the challenge conditions with Dase Village: from now until the end of the month, ten days later, inspection will be carried out, requiring that sorghum and beans be weeded four times, cotton be weeded seven times, topped and pruned, and all weeds on the edges and ends of the fields be removed, leaving no bare ground. Each person is required to plant an average of three-tenths of a mu of vegetables, seeking everyone's opinions. The masses immediately became excited, and some jumped up and said: These conditions are far from enough! Who doesn't know the words left by the elders: "Cotton weeded seven times, peaches will grow like eggs!" "Sorghum weeded eight times, chickens and dogs won't come near it!" Our sorghum is only being weeded four times, isn't that really half as much weeding? Immediately, everyone decided that each mutual aid team leader should lead the work, and the cadres should inspect. After the meeting, the masses were all very confident and said: This year, my crops must be done well. Some said: As long as each of our groups works hard, we will definitely be able to surpass him in the competition. Starting the next day, the whole village went to the fields before dawn. (Liu Wuqing)

[Report from this newspaper, Jinnan, 2nd] More weeding and manure accumulation to ensure increased production. The Zhou Yonghua Mutual Aid Brigade of Xiangchenggu, Qiuxian First District, recently established a production increase plan. The team has a total of twenty-seven people, five hundred and thirty-one mu of land, three cows, and three donkeys. Based on these circumstances: (1) Assign one person to be in charge of feeding the livestock, which can save five people, saving up to one hundred and fifty workdays in three months. (2) Weeding cotton five times and miscellaneous grains four times; weeding one more time can yield five more jin of grain per mu, so the entire team's land can increase production by two thousand six hundred and fifty jin. (3) Accumulating manure: add more soil to the three livestock pens, accumulating three large carts per pen per month. In addition, composting grass manure, pushing soil, and using pigs to tread manure is good for planting wheat. (4) In terms of frugality, eliminate smoking and drinking, and cancel eating public meals at gatherings. In the past, people had to eat a meal when selling noodles or cakes at gatherings, but now each person brings their own cornbread, which can save ten thousand yuan per month.

[Report from this newspaper, Wu'an] Cadres from all streets and systems in Yangyi Town, responding to the county party committee's call to make contributions, are fully leading the masses to develop their families and overcome famine. The current achievements include: (1) All land has been seeded, and seedlings have been taken care of. A total of more than eleven thousand six hundred mu have been rush-planted, and one hundred and sixty-seven and a half mu of radishes have been planted. In order to ensure that everyone can plant land, after the rain, plant the less-wet land first, then the wetter land, planting by plot, recording work by mu, assigning shares by person, controlling time and pricing, and settling accounts at any time. (2) Implementing the second hundred-day textile campaign, small-scale textile factories have been established in large numbers on each street. Currently, there are fifty-one mutual aid textile groups with two hundred and seventy-two people in the east and west streets. Eighteen small factories have been established in the east, west, and north streets, with a total of one hundred and ninety-seven women participating, all of whom have started spinning and weaving. The best textile factory is Zhao Qin's in the east street, with a total of twenty people. Their mutual aid method is also very good; those who can spin teach those who cannot spin, and those who can weave teach those who cannot weave. They have also established a plan for each person to complete six jin of cloth per month. (3) Each street and household is reducing their living standards and changing from rice to vegetables. In the past, each person in the east street ate one and a half jin of rice per day, but now they eat one jin and four taels, and clean the bottom every ten days. They proposed: Spin two more taels (of cotton) and eat four fewer taels (of rice), accelerate textile production to overcome the famine. In the past, each person in the west street ate one jin of rice per day, but now they eat twelve taels of rice, and make up for the shortfall with wild vegetables. Under the leadership of Zhang Mi (military dependent) and Jia Jing, vice chairpersons of the Women's Federation, a total of four thousand eight hundred and forty-five jin of wet vegetables were picked. Merchants used to eat white flour every day, but after saving, they eat white flour once every five days. (Zhi Bang, Xi Chen)

[Report from this newspaper, Shahe] The county experienced a general rain from the night of the 27th to the forenoon of the 28th, and most areas of the county were thoroughly soaked. In order to help and promote the masses to rush-plant, the county government convened a county cadre meeting on the afternoon of the 28th, deciding that only a very small number of necessary personnel should remain in the office, while the rest should help in the villages or go to the second, third, and fourth drought areas to help the masses rush-plant (the fifth, sixth, and seventh districts have already been seeded), and called on planting buckwheat and mung beans in sandy land, and late millet and vegetables in low-lying good land. A great rush-planting and replanting movement has now formed in each village. (Cong Li)

[Report from this newspaper] After the rain the other day, each company of the military region guard regiment, led by the political instructors, sent a total of two hundred and eighty-six soldiers to help the local people with farm work for two days, planting a total of two hundred and eighty-nine mu of land, weeding three hundred and fourteen mu, plowing sixty-two and three-tenths mu, and delivering six hundred and six dan of manure. The telephone operator of the Special Task Company weeded in the field for the villagers without taking a break at noon. The moved villagers praised on the blackboard: "The guard regiment is really good, helping us plant and weed. The army and the people are truly one family, we will never forget it even when we die. When I go to the district to attend a meeting, I will definitely report their merits." (Hai Qing)
