Introduction to Changzhi Farm
Tian Xiang

The Changzhi County Farm has been established for half a year and has made remarkable achievements in construction. The county government has issued a special order to commend it. The situation of the farm is introduced as follows:

I. Farm Work

(1) Cotton: In Changzhi, cotton planting is difficult to universally promote in some villages in the fourth and fifth districts, in addition to the first, second, and third districts, because the climate is not very suitable. The farm adopts training and domestication experiments, which will take three to five years, to improve the varieties so that they gradually adapt to the climate of the entire Changzhi County, and then conduct universal promotion. In addition, the masses were mobilized to conduct trial planting and joint research in various villages.

(2) Sugar Boiling: In order to increase the farm's income, four-tenths of a mu of sugar beets have been planted for experimental sugar boiling this winter. Once the experiment is successful, it will be promoted in the countryside. This variety does not exist in Changzhi. If it is promoted, it will be a very good sideline production for the masses.

(3) Waxy Sorghum: The characteristic of waxy sorghum is that the total amount is large and there is no shell. The farm has planted six ridges this year to see if it is suitable for promotion in Changzhi. If it is valuable, it will be promoted on a large scale next year.

(4) Maintaining Pure Varieties for Promotion: This year, the farm planted five mu of "811" millet, which can produce 1,500 jin of millet in a normal year, which can be used for the promotion of 1,500 mu next year. It also planted ten mu of "169" wheat, which can produce 1,000-1,500 jin, which can be used for the promotion of 150 mu next year. Because the Golden Queen corn is planted together with the local corn of the masses, it is difficult to obtain pure varieties, and the number of promotions is temporarily uncertain.

(5) Small Indigo Hole株 Experiment: The local people have a habit of planting small indigo. The general cultivation is 30 to 50株 per hole, which is very different from Shexian and Licheng. Shexian and Licheng have 7 to 15株 per hole. The county farm planted a total of seven mu of small indigo this year, divided into five types: 20株, 25株, 30株, 35株, and 40株, to test which one has the highest yield and which one is the most appropriate.

(6) Directly helping the fourth district organize "169" wheat contracted farmers and establish a model cotton field management area, work contacts were established with key village technical committees (Dong× Tianhe and other villages), and Fan Miniu, a labor hero from Huocun, was hired as an agricultural technician to achieve a combination of scientific guidance and mass experience.

(7) Forest Protection and Management: There are many forest trees on the hillsides near Yincheng, covering an area of about 500 mu, most of which are pine and cypress trees. This can be regarded as the first in the Taihang area. Therefore, the protection and management of this part of the mountain forest is indeed an important task. The farm has specially restored the ban on mountains and forests through the village office, formulated prohibitions, and plans to contact the Sangzimu Factory to make some wooden signs to be inserted into the forest slopes for regular inspections. Some trees need to be pruned, and the pruned branches can be priced to pay for carpentry wages. This effective management of forests will greatly benefit future production and construction undertakings.

(8) Organization of the Yincheng Wheat Competition: In order to promote excellent varieties, the farm took the opportunity of the Yincheng May 13th conference to receive the assistance of the agricultural and forestry bureau's resident county promoter, and organized a wheat competition (wheat competition), which is actually an agricultural production exhibition hall. Many people visited. In the last two days of the conference, the number of visitors was no less than 5,000 per day, which was well received by the masses. After visiting and comparing in practice, the general audience welcomed "169" wheat and "811" millet very much. They realized that the yield was indeed heavier than local crops, which improved the masses' confidence in the promotion of excellent varieties. Everyone unanimously reflected: "The seeds are really good, it's a pity that they were not planted last year," and asked to allocate seeds this year. Fan Miniu, a labor hero from Huocun, said to everyone: "Our village guarantees that we will all plant '169' wheat this year," which aroused the attention of various villages to this variety. In short, this wheat competition played a considerable role in promoting work in the whole region.

II. Farm Operation

Under the principle of self-reliance, the farm's operation is divided into two aspects in terms of income: agriculture and sideline business:

1. Land: Planting seven mu of small indigo, each mu can harvest 80 jin of indigo, for a total of 500 jin. Calculated at the market price, it can be converted into 120 shi of millet. Interplanting Chinese cabbage on the small indigo land can harvest 20,000 jin, which can be converted into 100 shi of millet. Other vegetables and crops can be converted into 30 shi of millet. The total income is 250 shi of millet.

2. Sideline Business: There is now a saltpeter workshop. According to the profit sharing of two pots, the food and wages of all workers in the field can be solved from July.

3. The annual expenditure mainly relies on the income from vegetables and other crops from the saltpeter workshop. If it cannot be solved, it will be made up for by winter production.

4. The income from small indigo and Chinese cabbage is used for the construction of dyeing workshops, mills, flour mills, vinegar workshops and other workshops to solve the farm's funding problems for next year, so as to achieve complete self-reliance.

III. Worker Issues

Worker Treatment: The treatment of workers is generally equivalent to the wages of a full-time worker. This wage system is that in addition to providing food of five dou of millet per month, seven dou of wages of rice are also issued. However, in order to give full play to the workers' work enthusiasm, a bonus sharing method is implemented for workers. According to the planned completion of tasks, 59% of the part exceeding the task (calculated in kind) is turned over to the public, another 20% is used as a reward for work models, active laborers, and those responsible for the farm, and the remaining 30% is distributed as bonuses according to the number of people. Regarding the education of workers, calculated according to farmers' lives, it is "half a year of hard work and half a year of leisure." During the busy farming season, the main focus is on business education. After the busy farming season, especially in winter, the main focus is on strengthening workers' cultural education. Current affairs education is carried out at any time. The workers are in a good mood to learn.

    长治农场介绍
    天祥
    长治县农场成立半年，场内建设成绩卓著，县政府特传令嘉奖，兹将该农场情形介绍于下：
    一、场内工作
    （一）棉花：在长治种棉除一、二、三区外，四、五区部分村庄因为气候不太适合，所以普遍推广尚有很多困难，农场采用训化试验，需三年至五年时间，来改良品种，使他逐渐适合了长治全县气候，然后再做普遍推广，此外在各村也发动了群众试种和群众共同研究。
    （二）熬糖：为了增加农场收入，特试种糖萝卜四分，作今冬试验熬糖之用；一经试验成功，就开始在乡间推广，这种品种在长治没有，如果推广之后，是群众一种很好的副业生产。
    （三）腊蜀黍：腊蜀黍的特点，是总量大没壳子，农场今年种了六畦，看他是否适合在长治推广，如有价值，明年当大量推广。
    （四）保持纯种推广，今年农场种“八一一”谷五亩，按一般年成可产谷一千五百斤，可供明年推广一千五百亩需用。并种“一六九”小麦十亩，可产一千——一千五百斤，可供明年一百五十亩推广之用，金皇后玉茭因与群众土玉茭播在一块，很难收得纯种，暂不确定推广数目。
    （五）小蓝穴株试验：当地群众有种小蓝习惯，一般的栽培每穴是三十株到五十株，与涉县、黎城相差甚远，涉县、黎城是每穴七株到十五株，县农场今年共种小蓝七亩、分为二十株、二十五株、三十株、三十五株、四十株等五种，借以试验，看究竟那一种产量重，那一种最适当。
    （六）直接帮助四区组织“一六九”小麦特约农家与建立模范棉田的管理区，有重点的和村技术委员会取得了工作联系（东×天河等村），并聘霍村劳动英雄范米牛当了农业技师，以达到科学指导与群众经验的结合。
    （七）林木保护与管理：荫城附近各地山坡林木很多，约有五百亩面积，大部为松、柏树，这在太行区说来要算第一位，所以对这部分山林保护与管理确是件重要工作，农场特通过村公所，恢复了禁山禁林，制定了禁约，并准备和桑梓木厂，连系起来，做些木牌插到林坡，经常检查，有的树需要整理树枝，整下的零枝可变价做木工工资，这种对林木的有效管理，给将来的生产建设事业有莫大的裨益。
    （八）荫城麦赛会的组织：农场为推广优良品种，借荫城五月十三大会之机会承受农林局驻县推广员之协助，组织了一个麦赛会（小麦比赛会），实际上就是个农业生产展览馆，参观的人很多，在大会最后两天，参观人数一日不下五千人，得到了群众好评。一般观众经过参观和实际比较，对“一六九”小麦和“八一一”谷非常欢迎，认识了确比本地作物产量重，提高了群众对优良品种的推广信心，大家一致反映是：“种籽实在好，可惜去年没有种上”，并要求今年给拨种籽。霍村劳动英雄范米牛向大家说：“我们村保证今年要都种‘一六九’小麦，这样更引起了各村对这样品种的注意，总之这次麦赛会对全区推广工作是起了相当推动作用。
    二、农场经营
    在自立更生的方针下，农场经营在收入方面分农业副业两方面：
    一、土地：种小蓝七亩，每亩可收靛八十斤，共是五百斤，按市价计算，可折小米一百二十石，小蓝地兼种白菜能收二万斤，以上折小米一百石，其他蔬菜和作物收下产品可折小米三十石，总共可收入小米二百五十石。
    二、副业：现在有硝坊一座，按锅两口分到红利从七月份起可以解决全场工人工食问题。
    三、全年开支主要依靠硝坊的蔬菜等作物收入解决，如解决不了，由冬季生产弥补。
    四、小蓝白菜收入作建设染坊磨坊粉坊醋坊等作坊需用，解决明年农场的经费问题。达到完全自立更生。
    三、工人问题
    工人待遇：工人待遇一般的相等于一个长工工资，这种工资制是每月除供给火食小米五斗外，再发给工资米七斗。但为了发挥工人的工作积极性，实行对工人的奖励分红办法，按照计划完成任务，在超过任务部分（以实物计算），抽出百分之五十九归公，另外百分之廿作为奖励工作模范，积极劳动和对场负责者，其余百分之三十按人数分红。关于工人的教育问题，以农民生活算起来，是“半年辛苦半年闲”，在农忙时期主要是业务教育，一过农忙季节特别是冬季，主要是加强工人的文化教育，时事教育是随时进行的。工人学习情绪都很好。
