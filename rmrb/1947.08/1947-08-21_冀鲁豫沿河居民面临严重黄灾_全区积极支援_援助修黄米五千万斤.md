　　Residents Along the Yellow River in Hebei-Shandong-Henan Face Severe Yellow River Disaster
    The Entire Region Actively Supports
  　Assistance: 50 Million Jin of Millet for River Repairs
    [Special Dispatch from This Newspaper] Since the Kuomintang reactionaries broke their faith and violated the Yellow River dike repair agreement, blocking the Yellow River breach at Huayuankou in an attempt to use the Chiang-created Yellow River disaster to submerge and destroy 11 million people in our Hebei-Shandong-Henan region, the Yellow River water has been surging eastward. The houses, food, and furniture of millions of residents along the river have been completely washed away, and the people are wandering around with the old and the young, suffering displacement. In addition to vigorously providing relief and resettlement, our democratic government is also leading the residents along the river to rush to repair dangerous sections. However, the Chiang Kai-shek reactionary clique is inhumane, taking advantage of the large-scale flooding to bomb the dikes daily with airplanes and shelling the banks with artillery. Repair workers and livestock are killed and injured every day, and the repaired dangerous sections are destroyed again. What crime have the people of Hebei-Shandong-Henan committed that they must be exterminated! Now, hundreds of miles of residents along the Yellow River in Hebei-Shandong-Henan are facing severe enemy and Yellow River disasters. Dozens of villages in Shou Zhang and Zhang Qiu have been submerged. Upon hearing this news, the people of the entire Shanxi-Chahar-Hebei region were filled with indignation and unanimously condemned Chiang Kai-shek, assisting our fellow countrymen in Hebei-Shandong-Henan. In addition to the millions of laborers in southern Hebei who have already been mobilized to rush to repair the dikes, the people of the entire region are voluntarily contributing two jin of millet per person, totaling 50 million jin, as support for dike repair, construction materials, wages, and expenses. In addition, the border government has allocated huge sums to supplement this. This grain and funds have been uniformly allocated by the Department of Finance to the Hebei-Shandong-Henan Administrative Office for distribution to the Yellow River Committee for use in overcoming the Yellow River disaster and Chiang bandits.

　　冀鲁豫沿河居民面临严重黄灾
    全区积极支援
  　援助修黄米五千万斤
    【本报特讯】自国民党反动派背信弃义，违反黄河修堤协定，堵塞花园口黄河决口，企图一举以蒋造黄祸淹没毁灭我冀鲁豫区一千一百万人民。现黄水已汹涌东流，河漕数百万居民楼舍房屋及食粮、家具荡然无存，人民扶老携幼，颠沛流连。我民主政府除大力救济安置外，并领导沿河居民抢修险工；乃蒋逆反动派灭绝人性，更乘黄泛大至，以飞机每日轮番轰炸，并以大炮排击堤岸，修堤人夫牲口日有死伤，修起之险工复被炸毁。我冀鲁豫人民何辜，必至使其灭绝而后快！现我冀鲁豫沿河数百里居民，面临严重敌灾黄灾，寿张、张秋已淹没数十村庄。我晋冀鲁豫全区人民，闻悉此项消息，愤怒填胸，一致声讨蒋逆，援助冀鲁豫同胞兄弟。除冀南前已动员数百万劳动力前往抢险修堤外，全区人民并自愿每人担任修黄米二斤，共计五千万斤，作为支援修堤建设材料工资费用，另由边府筹拨巨款补助。此项粮款，已由财厅统拨冀鲁豫行署转发黄委会应用，以战胜黄灾蒋匪。（王子英）
