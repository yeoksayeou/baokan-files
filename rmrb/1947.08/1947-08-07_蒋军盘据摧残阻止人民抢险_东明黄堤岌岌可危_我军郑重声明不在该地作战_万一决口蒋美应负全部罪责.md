    【Xinhua News Agency, Frontline, Hebei-Shandong-Henan, 4th】 A spokesperson for General Liu Bocheng's Headquarters stated: The Yellow River floodwaters are rising rapidly. The approximately seventy-mile stretch of the Yellow River levee from Dongming to Linpu, controlled by Chiang's troops, particularly the dangerous sections at Jiangsu Dam, Zhukou, and Liutun, are in imminent danger of breaching. The situation is extremely critical. Since the end of February this year, this seventy-mile section has been under the control of Chiang's troops, who have been wantonly destroying it, preventing the people from repairing the levee and saving themselves. The UN Relief and Rehabilitation Administration (UNRRA) and the Kuomintang Water Resources Commission have always harbored the conspiracy to flood the liberated areas. Therefore, although the Kuomintang and UNRRA superficially promised to repair this section, they have not genuinely done so for five months, leading to the current dangerous situation, which is extremely difficult to remedy. The spokesperson particularly pointed out: Currently, Chiang's troops are still occupying the area, preventing the people from carrying out disaster relief work. If the Kuomintang and its army still have a shred of conscience, allowing the people to immediately carry out disaster relief and levee repair, there may still be a glimmer of hope to turn the tide. Otherwise, the lives and property of millions of people will be destroyed. The spokesperson declared: The People's Liberation Army solemnly declares that it will not conduct military operations in this area. At the same time, we notify the local Chiang troops to allow the local people to freely carry out disaster relief. We make an urgent appeal to people across the country and the world, especially to UNRRA, to take urgent and effective measures to stop such brutal behavior by Chiang's troops. Otherwise, in the event of a Yellow River breach, the Kuomintang, Chiang Kai-shek, and UNRRA shall jointly bear the responsibility.

    蒋军盘据摧残阻止人民抢险
    东明黄堤岌岌可危
    我军郑重声明不在该地作战
    万一决口蒋美应负全部罪责
    【新华社冀鲁豫前线四日电】刘伯承将军司令部发言人称：黄河大水正在飞涨，蒋军控制之东明到临濮共约七十里黄河堤岸一段，特别是在江苏坝、朱口、刘屯等险工，随时都有决口可能，情势至为危急。此七十里地段，自今年二月底即为蒋军控制，尽情摧残，人民无法修堤自救；而联总行总及国民党水委会，历来抱着水淹解放区阴谋，因此国民党和联总虽曾表面答应修复该段，但为时五个月，并未真实进行，以致目前险象横生，达于极难收拾之地步。发言人特别指出：目前蒋军仍然盘据该地，阻止人民进行抢险工作，如果国民党及其军队尚有一念之善，允许人民立即抢险修堤，则转危为安，或尚有一线希望，否则数百万人民的生命财产将遭毁灭。发言人宣称：人民解放军今郑重声明，决不在该地进行军事行动。同时照会当地蒋军，准许当地人民自由抢险，我们特向全国全世界人士特别是向联总作紧急呼吁，采取紧急有效办法，制止蒋军此种残暴行为，否则万一黄河决口，则应由国民党蒋介石和联总共负其责。
