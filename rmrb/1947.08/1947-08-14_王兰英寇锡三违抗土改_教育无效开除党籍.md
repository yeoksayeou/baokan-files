Xinhua News Agency, Shandong, 11th – Wang Lanying, Director of the Women's Association of the Tieshan District of Huantai, Bohai, and Kou Xisan, Deputy District Head, have not changed their landlord stance, protect their relatives, and disobey land reform. After patient education within the Party proved ineffective, the local Party Committee announced their expulsion from the Party and removal from their positions to be dealt with by the masses. Wang is the daughter of a large feudal landlord and pseudo-official family. She was promoted to Director of the District Women's Association due to her temporary enthusiasm in joining the CCP. After marrying Xiang Qianzheng, the county head, her father and brothers continued to rule the village and manipulate the Farmers' Association. Wang's third brother privately released a traitor detained by the masses. When the masses angrily struggled against him and sent him to the district for detention, Wang coerced the masses to take him back and obstructed the masses' struggle in various ways, refusing to clear the masses' land deeds. Recently, during a county-wide cadre meeting, she still did not repent after two days and nights of education and openly defied the Party, requesting to resign. After democratic discussion at the meeting, the Party Committee decided to expel her from the Party and remove her from her work. County Head Xiang also proposed to dissolve the marital relationship with her on the spot. Kou Xisan came from a landlord family and is a speculator in the revolutionary camp. He joined the War of Resistance Against Japan in 1941. Now, he is resisting land reform by privately bailing out Zhu Yusheng (Kou's nephew by marriage), a special agent who colluded with the enemy to attack the democratic government and create a massacre. When everyone pointed out his mistakes, he still sophistically shielded him, insisting on a landlord reactionary stance. The County Party Committee has also decided to expel him from the Party, and the County Government has removed him from his post to be dealt with by the masses.

　　王兰英寇锡三违抗土改
  　教育无效开除党籍
    【新华社山东十一日电】渤海桓台铁山区妇会主任王兰英、副区长寇锡三不改其地主立场，包庇亲属，违抗土地改革，经党内耐心教育无效，当地党委特宣布开除其党籍，撤除职务交群众处理。王系大封建地主伪官僚家庭女儿，以一时积极加入中共，提拔为区妇会主任，与县长相潜正结婚，伊父兄即籍此继续统治本村，操纵农会；王之三兄私自释放群众扣押之奸特，群众忿怒将其斗争，送区看押后，王竟威逼群众将其要回，并多方阻挠群众斗争，拒绝清偿群众土地文契。近在全县干部会上经两昼夜教育仍不悔悟，反公然违抗，提请辞职，后经大会民主讨论，党委决定开除其党籍，撤免工作，相县长亦当场提出与之脱离夫妻关系。寇锡三系经营地主出身，是革命阵营中的投机分子，一九四一年参加抗战，现以私自保释勾结敌人袭击民主政府制造惨案的特务朱玉盛（寇之妻侄）对抗土地改革，经大家指出其错误时，仍狡辩掩护，坚持地主反动立场。该县县委亦决定开除其党籍，县政府亦将其撤职交群众处理。
