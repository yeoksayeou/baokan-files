Xinhua News Agency, Central China, 17th -- The people of Nantong, Rugao East, Haimen, and Qidong counties in Central Jiangsu have launched their first major campaign to join the army since the counter-insurgency. According to preliminary statistics, in the first half of July alone, more than 960 young people from Rugao East and Haimen counties joined the army to avenge their grievances. The movement shows two characteristics: First, the more intensely Chiang's bandits kill and burn, the more enthusiastic the people are to join the army. In the Ruzhong area, where Chiang's troops once burned down 500 homes, 270 people joined the People's Liberation Army in five days. Among 123 new soldiers in a certain district, two-thirds had suffered from Chiang's disasters. Wu Xingfa, who had been a tenant farmer for 19 years, had just turned over in the land reform, and was building a house and buying pigs to start a family and produce. This time, all his property was burned to the ground by Chiang's troops, so he actively joined the army, shouting, "I'm going to fight Old Chiang to the death!" The second is the universality of the region and the unprecedented enthusiasm for joining the army. Even people in the border areas and Chiang-occupied areas flocked to join the Liberation Army. Six young men from Dai Xu near the Dingyan stronghold on the Nantong (Rugao, Nantong) line heard that the Chiang's puppet Pao-chang was going to conscript them, so they actively fled to join the people's ranks. Miao Zulu, a teacher from a liberal small landlord family, assisted the democratic government day and night in doing propaganda work for new soldiers, passing his house six times without entering; finally, he signed up to join the army himself, saying: "Although I am a small landlord, my parents were robbed and my wife was killed. If I don't avenge this, how can I be a human being!?"
Xinhua News Agency, Jin-Cha-Ji, 17th -- A part of the Chiang's army officers and soldiers, totaling more than 1,400, who laid down their weapons in the Qingxian County campaign, after more than a month of speaking out about their sufferings and turning their hearts, recognized the crimes of the traitor Chiang Kai-shek in selling out the country and harming the people. They unanimously requested to join the People's Liberation Army to perform meritorious service for the people in order to atone for their past sins. The Officer Training Office of the Central Hebei Liberation Army held a grand meeting at the end of last month to warmly send them off.

　　苏中敌后掀起参军潮
  　蒋军越烧杀人民队伍越壮大
    【新华社华中十七日电】苏中南通、如（皋）东、海门、启东四县人民掀起反清剿以来首次大参军运动。据初步统计，七月上半月仅如（皋）东、海门二县即有九百六十余青年参军复仇。运动中表现两个特点：其一、愈是蒋贼烧杀厉害的地方参军愈热烈，曾遭蒋军一次烧毁五百家的如中地区，五天内即有二百七十人参加人民解放军。某区一百二十三个新战士中身受蒋灾者即占三分之二。曾作了十九年的佃贫农的吴兴发，土地改革翻身后，正砌屋买猪，发家生产，此次全部翻身家产被蒋军付之一炬，乃积极参军，他高喊：“我要去和老蒋拚命！”其次是地区之普遍与参军情绪之空前热烈，连边沿区及蒋占区人民也涌来参加解放军。如通（如皋、南通）线上丁堰据点近郊戴徐六青年听说蒋记保长要抽他们，积极逃来参加人民队伍。开明小地主出身的师教缪祖漉日夜协助民主政府做新战士宣教工作，曾六过家门而不久；最后他自己报名参军说：“我虽是小地主，但我父母被劫，老婆被杀，此仇不报，何以为人！？”
    【新华社晋察冀十七日电】青（县）（县）战役中放下武器之蒋军官兵一部共一千四百余名，经月余的诉苦翻心，认识蒋贼介石卖国殃民罪行，一致要求参加人民解放军，为民立功以赎前罪。冀中解放军官训练处特于上月底召开大会热烈欢送。
