    General Chen Geng's troops are studying land reform and conducting class and ideological investigation movements in batches. The first batch began on the 13th of last month and ended on the 20th, with a total of 270 cadres above the platoon level participating in the training. Deputy Commander Han and Political Commissar Xie personally mobilized the troops, and invited Comrade Wang Yidan, the secretary of the local sub-committee, to report on the land reform situation in a typical village. Then, all the cadres engaged in a heated discussion. Most comrades recognized the importance of land reform and bravely exposed their thoughts. For example, some comrades, due to prolonged detachment from production or due to their family background, were indifferent to the exploitation by landlords and emphasized taking care of landlords. Comrade ××× even believed that his relative was a "good" landlord without any acts of rape or tyranny. After everyone calculated the accounts, it was found that the landlord had exploited farmers for more than 6,000 shi of fine grain in just the past 20 years. This made him realize that all landlords live by exploitation. At the same time, it shocked all comrades and strengthened their hatred for the cruel exploitation of landlords, clarifying their attitude towards the landlord class. Then, everyone naturally turned to examining their own thoughts. Some comrades reflected on having interfered with mass movements, and others reflected on concealing the objects of struggle and sheltering the transfer of landlords' property. Finally, everyone studied the problems and errors that our troops and ourselves are most likely to commit in the land reform movement, as well as their root causes, raising everyone's vigilance. Then, everyone automatically drew up plans for future efforts. At the end of the training, many comrades believed that in the past they often said "serve the people faithfully," but unconsciously did things that violated the interests of the people. The second batch of training cadres was also concentrated on the 26th. The political organs also printed and distributed land reform materials for soldiers throughout the army for long-term education.

    陈赓将军所部分批集训
    进行土地改革教育
    【本报太岳四日电】陈赓将军所部，学习土地改革，进行查阶级查思想运动。首批于上月十三日开始，至二十日结束，共集训排以上干部二百七十名。韩副司令员与谢政委亲自动员，并请当地分委书记王一丹同志，报告一个典型村庄的土地改革情形，然后全体干部展开了热烈的讨论。大部同志认清了土地改革的重要，勇敢的暴露自己的思想。如有些同志因脱离生产过久，或因出身关系，漠视地主的剥削，强调对地主的照顾。×××同志甚至认为自己的亲戚是个“好”地主，没有奸霸行为，经大家以算帐的方式，算出该地主仅二十年来，即剥削农民六千余石细粮，才使他认识了凡地主都靠剥削过活，同时使全体同志大吃一惊，加强了对地主残酷剥削的仇恨，明确了对地主阶级的态度。接着每个人很自然的转入对自己的思想检查，有的同志反省出自己曾经干涉过群众运动，有的反省出隐藏过斗争对象包庇转移过地主的财物。最后大家又研究了我们的部队和自己在土地改革运动中最易犯的毛病与错误及根源，提高了大家的警惕性，然后每个人皆自动的订出今后努力的计划。集训结束时，许多同志认为过去嘴里常说“忠实为人民服务”，可是不知不觉作了些违犯人民利益的事情。第二批集训干部亦于二十六日集中。政治机关并向全军印发战士土改材料，以作长期教育。
