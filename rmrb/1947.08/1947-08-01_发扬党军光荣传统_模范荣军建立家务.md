    Carry Forward the Glorious Tradition of the Party's Army
    Model Veterans Establish Homes
    [Comprehensive report from this newspaper] Veterans from various parts of Taihang are inheriting the tradition of hard work and struggle of the Party's army, actively engaging in production, and establishing homes. Various places have successively produced many model veterans. Comrade Yang Qiyuan, a veteran standard-bearer in Heshun, achieved remarkable production results last year, reaching the level of cultivating one and having a surplus equivalent to two. He was selected as a model for establishing a family. This year, he completely declined assistance from the masses and joined a mutual aid team, where he was elected as the team leader. In production, he focuses on agriculture while also engaging in sideline occupations. In addition to cultivating his own land, his family raises two fat pigs and is raising two more, which could generate an income of 65,000 yuan. He plans to achieve a surplus equivalent to four for every one cultivated. He also pays attention to helping other veterans get rich and actively helps the masses solve difficulties by adjusting seeds and lending grain, gaining the support of the local people. Chen Fuhe, a veteran from Xiyang, turned over a new leaf in the land reform movement. He serves as the political director in the village, and the masses support him greatly. In the great production campaign, his enthusiasm for production is very high. Although he is disabled and only has one arm, he does not slack off in production. He does light work if he cannot do heavy work and declines assistance, instead participating in mutual aid teams, using his cattle and donkeys to exchange labor. He stands guard, delivers letters, and watches the mill for others, exchanging labor for them to harvest wheat and weed his fields. Because he does not take advantage of others, the masses like to engage in mutual aid and labor exchange with him. He learns weaving from women, raises pigs, and weaves straw hats. He balances agriculture and sideline occupations, and this year he expects to achieve a surplus equivalent to one for every three cultivated. Comrade Li Runwa, a model veteran from Baidian Village, Yuci, is a first-class disabled veteran. After arriving in the village, he consciously abides by government laws and regulations, obeys leadership, and unites with cadres and the masses like a family. He participates in the militia and also performs general duties for the village. During the Zhengtai Campaign, he requested to go to the front to participate in the war, but due to concerns about his weak health, he was assigned to be the quartermaster of the transportation station. He happily accepted. He is active and responsible in his work, taking the initiative to overcome difficulties, ensuring that the lives of more than 400 people are not affected in the slightest. Wang Tiekui, a veteran from Beiganquan, Pingshun, only retired and settled down in February of this year. However, he has already gained the love and support of the local people. He not only does not need assistance but also cultivates land for the families of soldiers participating in the war. He carefully plans and arranges his life and resolutely implements the instructions of the superiors, such as when the superiors called for thrift, he led his mutual aid team to first formulate a thrift plan. Other groups were still complacent, thinking that after the summer harvest, they would not have to worry about the autumn harvest. However, he earnestly warned his team members: we must guard against drought every year and thieves every night; we must not be careless. He tries his best to help team members solve difficulties, showing them meticulous care. Two members of the group, Ping Laifa and Zhang Zengze, bought a large tree but could not immediately pay for it, so he automatically lent them one stone and five dou of rice. There are other similar examples. He is good to both cadres and the masses, so the cadres and the masses are even better to him and support him more, so he plays a greater role in the group. Reasonably arranging labor and completing planting, everyone supports him, and the mutual aid is most consolidated.

    发扬党军光荣传统
    模范荣军建立家务
    【本报综合讯】太行各地荣退军人，继承党军艰苦奋斗传统，积极生产，建立家务，各地并先后涌现不少荣军模范。和顺荣军旗帜杨启元同志去年生产成绩卓著，达到耕一余二，被选为建家模范。今年完全谢绝群众代耕，参加互助组被选为小组长，他在生产上是以农业为主，农副兼顾。他家除自种地外，喂二口肥猪，还伴养两口，可进款六万五千元，预计要作到耕一余四。他还注意帮助其他荣退军人发家致富，并积极帮助群众解决困难，调剂种籽，出借粮食，获得当地群众拥护。昔阳荣军陈福和在土地改革运动中翻了身，他在村里担任政治主任，群众对他很拥护。开展大生产运动中，他的生产情绪很高，他残废后只剩一只胳膊，生产上并不怠工，自己不能做重活作轻活，并谢绝代耕参加互助组，用自己牛、驴变工，他替别人站岗、送信、看磨子，变工给他收麦、锄苗。由于他的不占人便宜，群众都喜欢和他互助变工，学妇女纺织、喂猪、编草帽，他做到农副兼顾，今年预计今年可达耕三余一。榆次白佃村荣军模范李润娃同志是一等残废，到村里后自觉遵守政府法令，服从领导，和干部群众团结的像一家人，参加民兵还服村上一般勤务。正太战役时，他要求到前方参战，因照顾他的身体弱，分配作运输站的事务长，他高兴的接受了。在工作中积极负责，主动克服困难，使四百余人的生活丝毫没感受困难。平顺北甘泉荣退军人王铁块，今年二月才退伍安家。但己取得当地群众的爱戴拥护；他不仅自己不用代耕，还替村上参战人代耕，细订生活计划和安排生活，对上级号召是推动全组坚决执行，如上级号召节约时，他领导自己的互助组，首先订出节约计划。而其他组还在麻痹自满，以为收了夏还怕接不住秋，但他却谆谆告诫组员们：要年年防旱，夜夜防贼，可不敢大意。有困难，尽量帮助组员解决，无微不至的体贴他们，组内平来发张增则二人，买了一棵大树，当下拿不出米，他就自动的借给他们一石五斗米。其他类此的事还有。他对干部对群众都好，所以干部群众对他也就更好，更赞成，因此他在组里起的作用也就更大。合理安排劳力，完成种地，人人拥护他，互助最巩固。
