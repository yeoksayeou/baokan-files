　　Jiao Wubao's Leadership Methods
    Peng Bo
    Editor's Note: Jiao Wubao, a hero of the Taiyue troops, recently made contributions through combat mutual assistance, setting an example for the troops in the area, and thereby improved combat effectiveness. He was awarded the Taiyue Military Region's Special Class Combat Hero Medal. His leadership methods are published here for reference by comrades in the troops.

　　I. Personal exemplary action inspired the enthusiasm of the masses.
    Using personal exemplary action to promote and influence everyone is one of Jiao Wubao's leadership methods. It's not just doing things yourself and not letting others do them, nor is it just directing others without doing anything yourself. He uses his actions to induce and inspire everyone to act. This not only leverages the power of the masses, but also leverages the enthusiasm and creativity of the masses.
    After the Quwo battle, our battalion, in order to strengthen the relationship between the army and the people in the newly recovered areas, put forward the slogan of "Four Nos." He quickly convened a mutual aid group meeting, first reviewing his past relations with the people, and then formulating a "Four Nos" plan. As soon as the meeting ended, he picked up buckets and carried two loads of water for the villagers. This moved the villagers and also moved the comrades in his squad. When he was about to carry the third load, the bucket was snatched away by someone else.
    In March of this year, the troops had a mission to cross the Qin River, but the bridge was broken and the troops could not pass. Jiao Wubao took off his clothes, broke the thin ice, and jumped into the waist-deep river. Others advised him to come out and not catch a cold, but he said, "My personal well-being is a small matter; how can the troops complete their mission if they can't cross the river?"
    When the troops were crossing south, he had not recovered from catching a cold during that Qin River wading. The company cadres and his squad comrades all advised him to stay home and not participate in the battle, but fearing that it would affect everyone's morale, he pretended that his illness was cured. Under the influence of his active participation in the war, all the cadres and soldiers of the company scrambled to join the first assault team to cross the Yellow River.

　　II. Learning humbly and patiently with mutual assistance
    Everyone admires Jiao Wubao's humility and his spirit of learning. This is a condition for his integration with the masses, and it is also the condition that enables him to become an outstanding hero.
    Becoming a hero makes us feel very glorious and very proud, but Jiao Wubao is not like that. If someone looks at him with admiring eyes, or says, "Jiao Wubao is really capable!" he would blush with embarrassment. This glorious title of "hero," falling on Jiao Wubao, is like carrying a "burden." Of course, this is not a negative burden, but a manifestation of his humility, which contains great positive factors.
    In the first month of the lunar year, the brigade held a heroes' conference. When we were sending him off, he said at a general meeting of soldiers in the whole battalion: "Everyone elected me as a hero, and I feel that it is still far from enough. I don't have any special skills, and if I have a little, it is learned from everyone. I hope that everyone will help me more in the future, and I must learn from you." These words were not hypocritical self-deprecation, but completely expressed the truth in his heart. When he came back from the heroes' conference and saw that everyone had made great progress in military training, but he hadn't learned anything, he took the attitude of an elementary school student and went to learn from others. At that time, Pang Tongshan threw grenades relatively far, so he learned grenade throwing from Pang Tongshan. The comrades in other squads were very good at bayonet fighting, so he brought his group to learn from other squads. He kept practicing even when others were asleep, and they had already gotten up and practiced for two hours before the reveille. He often took his mutual aid group, and sometimes joined other groups, so that everyone could learn together and study together. This method of everyone learning and everyone teaching gave play to the intelligence of the masses and made learning progress quickly. In less than two weeks, everyone improved their grenade throwing by ten meters. Later, Kong Suowan's group, Ma Derong's group, and other classes and platoons all adopted his mass teaching method, which set off a wave of military training throughout the battalion.
    Because of his humility, patience, and his loving and honest attitude towards his comrades, everyone felt that he was respectable and approachable, and they were willing to approach him and talk to him. For example, squad leader Li Ligong, who was from Henan, was ideologically confused during the southward crossing, so he went to Jiao Wubao and said, "Wubao, my thoughts are messed up again. I just want to go home." After talking with Jiao Wubao, the problem was solved.

　　III. Studying thoughts and paying attention to commendation.
    Comrade He Fuchu was a veteran soldier before the counter-offensive. In the past, his performance had not been good, and he was pessimistic about his work. He often said, "I'm so old, what else can I do! It's enough to eat two meals a day." When others mobilized him to set a merit-making plan, he said, "@! You guys set it, I won't bother." He was often too lazy to even wash his face and feet. Although cadres and comrades continued to help and educate him, he never changed. Some of the cadres were very worried about him, but Jiao Wubao did not lose confidence. In March, He Fuchu was transferred to Jiao Wubao's mutual aid group. Jiao Wubao first talked to him, soliciting his opinions on how to improve the mutual aid group, and said, "You are an old comrade and have the ability. Our mutual aid group will definitely do well, but we still have to rely on everyone's efforts."
    After Jiao Wubao talked to him, he asked others to talk to him, and as soon as he found any material, he would immediately find the squad leader, platoon leader, or comrades in the group to study it together, and find out the law of He's thinking. Everyone also discussed how to specifically help He; later, it was indeed effective. In the second southward crossing, he performed very well, and he was immediately commended in the group and squad. Later, he set a merit-making plan, and he was commended again. He's mood had already changed. In the Quwo battle, although He was more diligent than before, he was not as good as Comrade Zhang Maimai. In order to commend him without affecting others, he and the squad leader first explained He Fuchu's progress to Zhang, and then proposed at the squad meeting, "Today He Fuchu has made much more progress than in the past. If he continues to work hard like this, he may become a hero in the future." He said at the time, "I have been working for several years and have never received any praise. This is the first time." He also proposed to everyone: "The merits I have made this time don't count. In the future, when fighting the Chiang army, fighting with bayonets, getting weapons, and capturing enemies will count as making merits." Later, He Fuchu became an activist.

　　IV. Combining combat and teaching, new developments make new soldiers into old heroes.
    Jiao Wubao's combination of combat and teaching is to regard the battlefield as a classroom and the training ground as a battlefield to lead new soldiers. Jiao Wubao has recently made great progress in this method. It has promoted the development of new heroism and the merit-making movement, and has become a strong guarantee for every battle victory.

　　焦五保的领导方法
    彭勃
    编者按：太岳部队英雄焦五保，近以战斗互助建功，示范该区部队，并从而提高了战斗力，荣获太岳军区特等战斗英雄奖章，兹将其领导方法发表于此，以供部队同志参考。
　　一、个人的模范作用启发了群众的积极性
    以个人的模范作用，来推动和影响大家，这是焦五保领导的办法之一，不光是自己干，不让别人干，也不是光指挥别人自己不干，他是以自己的行动，来诱导启发大家都干。这不仅是发挥了群众的力量，而且也发挥了群众的积极性和创造性。
    曲沃战斗后，我营为了加强新收复区的军民关系，提出了四不走的口号，他很快召开了互助小组会，首先检讨了自己过去的军民关系，又订出了四不走的计划。会议刚结束，他就担起水桶给老乡担了两担水，这一下感动了老乡，也感动了他班的同志，当他再要担第三担时，水桶就被别人抢跑了。
    今年三月间，部队有任务要过沁河，可是桥断了，部队不能通过，焦五保就脱光衣服，打破薄冰，跳进水深过腰的河中，别人劝他出来，不要冻病了，他还说：“我个人是小事，部队过不去河怎能完成任务”。
    部队南渡时，他因为那次沁河下水，冻病了还没有好，连里干部和他班的同志，都劝他留到家里，不要参加战斗，但他恐怕使大家的情绪受影响，假说自己的病好了，在他这种积极参战的影响下，全连的干部战士，都争着要参加强渡黄河的第一突击队。
　　二、虚心耐心互助互学
    焦五保的虚心和他的学习精神，是没有一个不佩服的，这是他结合群众的条件，也是他所以能够成为一个出色英雄的条件。
    成了英雄，这叫我们感到是非常光荣，也是非常可以自骄的，但焦五保就不是这样，如果有人以羡慕的眼光看一看他，或是说个：“焦五保真能干”！他会羞得脖子发红，这个光荣的“英雄”称号，落在焦五保的身上，就好象背了一个“包袱”，当然，这不是什么消极的包袱，这是他虚心的表现，是包含有很大的积极因素的。
    正月间旅里召开群英大会，当我们欢送他的时候，他在全营的军人大会上说：“大家选我当英雄，我觉得还非常不够，我也没有啥本事，即是有一点，也是跟大家学的，希望以后大家对我多多帮助，我一定要向大家好好学习”。这些话并不是虚伪的自谦，完全是说出了他内心的实话。当他开群英会回来，见到大家练兵都有了很大的进步，可是自己还没有学啥，所以他就以小学生的态度，去找别人学习，当时庞同山投弹投的较远，就向庞同山学投弹，刺枪别班的同志都很行，就带上的组，到别的班去学，别人睡了他还再练，还没有吹起床号，他们已起来练了两个钟头了，经常的都是带着他的互助组，也有时和别的组在一起，大家共同学习共同研究。这种大家学，大家教的办法，发挥了群众的智能，使学习进步很快，不到两个礼拜，投弹每人进步十米，后来孔所万组、马德荣组，和别班别排，都采用了他的这种群众性的教学办法。使全营都掀起了练兵的热潮。
    由于他的虚心耐心，和对同志的热爱诚实的态度，大家都觉得他可敬可亲，都愿意接近他，和他谈话；如八班长李立功，家是河南人，在南渡时思想混乱了，就找焦五保说：“五保我的思想又闹不通了，光想回家。”经焦五保谈话后，也就解决了。
　　三、研究思想注意表扬
    何福图同志是反攻前的老战士，过去一贯表现不够好，对工作消极悲观，他常说：“咱这么大的年纪啦，还能干个啥！一天吃上两顿饭就算啦。”别人动员他订立功计划，他说：“＠！你们订吧，咱不闹那。”经常懒的脚脸都不愿洗。别人和他谈话，他只能得到三个字的回答：“没有啥！”虽然干部和同志，不断的帮助教育他，可总没有转变，干部们有的对他很发愁，可是焦五保没有失掉信心，三月间何福图调到焦五保的互助组焦焦五保先找他谈了话，征求他对搞好互助组的意见，并说：“你是老同志，有能力，咱们的互助组一定能搞好，不过还得靠咱大家都努力。”
    焦五保谈了话又叫别人谈，发现一点材料，就马上找班长排长，或组里的同志，共同研究，找出了何的思想规律，大家又讨论如何对何具体帮的办法；以后，果然有效。在第二次南渡时，他表现很好，在组里和班里，马上表扬了，后来他订了立功计划，又作了表扬，何的情绪，已经有了转变，在曲沃战斗中，何虽说比以前努力了，可是还比不上张麦麦同志，为了表扬不使别人受影响，他和班长首先和张谈明了何福图的进步，再在班务会上提出“今天何福图比已往进步多了，如这样的努力下去，将来还可能英雄。”何当时说：“我干了几年没有落过一个好，这还是第一回。”并向大家提出：“这次立的功还不算话，以后和蒋军作战，拚拚刺刀，得了武器，俘虏敌人才算立功”。以后，何福图变成积极分子了。”
　　四、战教结合新发挥新战士变成老英雄
    焦五保的战教结合，就是把战场当作课堂，把操场当作战场，来带领新战士。这一办法，焦五保最近又有了很大的发挥，它推动了新英雄主义，和立功运动的发展，成了每次战斗胜利的有力保证。
