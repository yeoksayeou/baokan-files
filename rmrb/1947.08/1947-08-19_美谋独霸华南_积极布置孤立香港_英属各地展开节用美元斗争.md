Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 17th: Wedemeyer flew from Shanghai to Guangzhou on the 15th, stayed for a day, and flew back to Nanjing on the afternoon of the 16th. Wedemeyer's "inspection" of South China is a sign of US imperialist aggression in South China. To this end, the United States must simultaneously exclude British forces. When Wei met with the US Consul General in Hong Kong, Haber, at the US Consulate in Guangzhou on the 15th, it showed his special interest in Hong Kong. According to the Central News Agency, he was "listening to Haber's report on the current economic, political, and financial issues related to Hong Kong and Guangzhou, which is of particular interest to the special envoy group." At the same time, it has recently been rumored that the US government has signed an agreement with Portugal, in which the Portuguese side will allocate all the ports of Macau's Xin Dianhai to the United States for opening up commercial ports, and the US will provide three million US dollars for port construction. This is generally considered to be one of the steps taken by the United States to isolate Hong Kong. On the 15th and 16th, Wei met twice with the leaders of the Chinese political beggar parties, the Min and Qing parties, in Guangdong; and asked the presidents of universities in Guangzhou with obvious malice: Why are the students of Guangzhou universities enthusiastically participating in the patriotic movement? When Wei met with the Chiang Kai-shek's civil and military officials in Guangzhou, he held secret talks on military, political, and economic issues. The specific content of the talks was not released as usual. According to the Central News Agency, after Wei returns to Nanjing, his members will individually go to the Chiang-controlled areas and other places to "investigate." The agency revealed that Sun Liren, the Chiang Kai-shek's general favored by US imperialism, admitted when meeting with reporters in Changchun on the 14th that the US's assistance to Chiang in training new troops was "proceeding smoothly." Sun himself plans to fly back to Nanjing from the Northeast before the 20th to receive instructions from the Supreme Emperor Wedemeyer.

Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 17th: According to various sources: The United Kingdom is now working hard to launch a struggle to save US dollars within the empire. In July, the authorities of the British colony of Singapore announced that "all American luxury goods will be prohibited from being imported from now on" to help the United Kingdom overcome its economic difficulties. On the 16th, the Australian authorities also decided to reduce US dollar expenditures, announcing a reduction in gasoline rationing by 10% to 15%, and strictly restricting "travel using US dollars." Reducing the import of American tobacco, movies, printing presses, and other non-essential necessities is also under consideration.

　　美谋独霸华南
  　积极布置孤立香港
  　英属各地展开节用美元斗争
    【新华社陕北十七日电】魏德迈于十五日由沪飞广州，停留一天，已于十六日下午飞返南京，魏之“视察”华南为美帝国主义大举侵略华南的标志，为此目的，美国即必须同时把英国势力排斥出去。十五日魏在广州美领事馆接见美驻香港总领事哈柏时，显示其对香港的特别兴趣。据中央社称，彼系“听取哈柏报告目前香港与广州有关经济、政治、财政等问题，此为特使团所特感兴趣者。”同时，最近盛传美政府已与葡萄牙签订协定，葡方将澳门新滇海全部港口划归美国开辟商埠，美方则拿出三百万美元为筑港之用。此事被一般认为是美国企图孤立香港的步骤之一。十五日及十六日魏曾两度接见中国政治乞丐民、青两党在广东之头领；并以显然恶意态度询问广州各大学校长：广州各大学学生为什么热烈参加爱国运动？魏在广州会见蒋家文武官员时，曾密谈军事、政治、经济各项问题，谈话之具体内容则照例不予发表。据中央社称：魏返京后将由其团员个别分赴蒋管区及其他各地“调查”。该社泄露，美帝国主义宠爱的蒋家将领孙立人于十四日在长春接见记者时，承认美国助蒋训练新军一事“正在顺利进行中”。孙本人则拟于二十日前由东北飞返南京，以便接受太上皇魏德遇之训示。
    【新华社陕北十七日电】各方讯：英国现正在帝国范围内努力展开节省美元的斗争。七月英殖民地新加坡当局宣布，“美国之全部奢侈品自此后将禁止其进口”，以协助英国渡过经济困难。十六日，澳洲当局亦决议减少美元支出，宣布汽油配售量减少百分之十至十五，并严格限制“使用美元旅行”。减少美国烟草、影片、印报机及其他非最重要之必须品入口一事，亦在考虑中。
