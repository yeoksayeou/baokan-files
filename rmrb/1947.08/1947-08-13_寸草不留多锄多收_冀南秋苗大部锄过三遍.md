Thorough Weeding for a Bountiful Harvest
　　Most Autumn Seedlings in Southern Hebei Have Been Weeded Three Times
　　[This newspaper's Southern Hebei, 10th dispatch] Under the slogan of "Thorough Weeding for a Bountiful Harvest," farmers in various regions have mostly completed weeding their autumn seedlings three times. Following Wang Guanzhuang in Qinghe's summary of the labor emulation drive for crash planting, mutual aid teams are even more energetic in hoeing seedlings. The autumn seedlings have been weeded three times, and sorghum has already produced young rice. In Qizhi Donglu Zhuang, twelve mutual aid teams spent three days weeding all 2,300 mu of late seedlings in the village, with some starting their second weeding. In Beimatou, Daming, sixteen voluntary mutual aid teams were formed. Zhang Zhegui's team of five people weeded twenty mu of land in two days. The ten mutual aid teams in Nanmatou first weeded 300 mu of land belonging to military families, and then weeded land for families providing stretcher bearers for the front lines. The entire village plans to complete the weeding of late seedlings in five days. At the end of last month, the fourth district of Linqing launched a surprise attack on weeding seedlings, with village-to-village competition. People constantly worked in the fields at noon and in the evenings. Tian Yishan, a farmer from Yao Village in Gaotang, often weeded until dusk before returning home, leaving his 24 mu of land completely weed-free. Qiu Changnian and his wife from Qianfosi weeded seedlings without even stopping for a noon break. Huang Fengshi, a military family member from Shicao, started weeding before dawn to weed her land more thoroughly. Yang, the director of the Shifangyuan women's association, busied herself with weeding during the day and pressed melons under the moonlight in the evenings, having already weeded her land three times. In Xiaozhai, Jize, mutual aid teams launched a weeding challenge, weeding 800 mu of seedlings in two days. In Guohe, Handan, all Party members led mutual aid teams, first weeding the land belonging to military families, and then their own, with women and children watering gardens. In Zhaojia, Ji County, twenty-one mutual aid teams weeded 500 mu of seedlings in eight days. The cadre teams in Nanjia and Zhangjiazhuang weeded 21 mu of peanuts in five days. Liu Guihua, the director of the women's association in Jiaogao Village, Hengshui, led all members in participating in weeding seedlings, proposing weeding large seedlings four times and small seedlings three times.
　　[This newspaper's Southern Hebei, 11th dispatch] The fourth district of Qizhi completed its plan to dig wells and rush-plant turnips, digging eighty brick wells and more than ninety earthen wells in twenty days. Zhu Village alone dug three brick wells and forty-two earthen wells, exceeding its plan. After the wells were dug, people rushed to plant turnips with mutual assistance, planting over a thousand mu in five days. Houwei Village has already planted eighty mu, averaging one mu per household. Longwang Village in the ninth district of Linqing discovered 740 mu of wasteland, determined who owns the land and who should plant it, and land not planted by the owner would be given to others. Currently, 296 mu of turnips and 27 mu of alfalfa have been planted, and the remaining land is planned to be planted with red wicker shrubs and willows.
