　　We arrived at Dayou Village to camp in the middle of the night. "Now where will they sleep!" the squad leader worried. The old landlady greeted him and asked:
　　"Comrade! How many of you are there?"
　　"Fifteen,"
　　"That's going to be difficult. There's another house in this courtyard, take a look at it!" She led us to the north room.
　　"Old lady! Aren't you sleeping in this house?"
　　"No, I'm not," she explained to me, "I was just here in case you came and needed something. I sleep in the next courtyard!"
　　"Oh!" We believed her words. The squad leader noticed a small room to the left of the entrance and asked:
　　"Can't anyone sleep in that little room?"
　　"No, that's a cattle pen," she replied definitively.
　　"That's fine then! Sorry to bother you!" I turned around and she was already gone, busy finding brooms and stools for the comrades…
　　"Old lady? Can you take the door panel off this cattle pen?"
　　"Yes, I can." She helped that comrade, and with great effort, removed the door panel. After all the arrangements, there were still three of us without bedding.
　　"Let's get some wheat straw and sleep on the ground here!"
　　"Isn't this a quilt? It's better than sleeping on wheat straw!" The old lady took a quilt, half-new and half-old, from the bed. I asked her, feeling embarrassed:
　　"Is no one using this?"
　　"No one is using it! It's an extra one," she said as she spread it out on the ground.
　　"Shouldn't we sweep first?" We were afraid of getting her quilt dirty.
　　"No need to sweep! Hurry up and get ready to sleep!"
　　We were indeed exhausted from marching all night. As soon as I lay down, I drifted off, only hearing the old lady's footsteps in the courtyard for a while, then fell sound asleep.
　　The next day, the troops set off early. I stayed behind to clear up the formalities with the locals. After checking all three houses, only the door panel of that small room was not back on. I carried the door panel, and as soon as I walked over, a stench hit me in the face. It really was a cattle pen.
　　"What!" I noticed an old woman lying in the eastern corner. I went closer and saw it was the landlady. Under her, there were some uneven stalks of wheat straw. She was not covered with a quilt and lay motionless.
　　"Why is the old lady sleeping here?" This question swirled in my mind. I looked at all three houses in the courtyard where we had slept, and then thought of the mats and quilts the comrades had used. I felt deeply ashamed and said to myself:
　　"What reason do we have not to fight hard for them?"

　　宿营
    萧茅
    半夜里，我们到大油村宿营了，“睡不下呀!”分队长发了愁，房东老太太迎着他说：
    “同志！你们几个人？”
    “十五个，”
    “那可睡不下，这院还有一座房，你们再瞧瞧吧！”他把我们引到北屋。
    “老太太！你不是在这座屋睡吗？”
    “不是的，”他向我解释着，刚才我在这，是怕你们来了找个啥不方便，我在隔壁院睡哩！”
    “噢！”她的话我们相信了，分队长发现一进大门的左边还有座小房便问：
    “那座小屋不能睡人？”
    “不能睡，是个牛圈”，她肯定的回答了他。
    “这就行啦！可麻烦你啦！”我一回头她早不见啦，她忙的只是在给同志们找扫帚，找凳子……
    “老太太？你这喂牛房的门板能摘吗？”
    “可以的”她帮那个同志，又吃力的摘下来门板，整理到最后，还有我们三个没铺的。
    “咱们弄些麦秸，就在这地下睡吧！”
    “这不是条被子？不比睡在麦秸上强！”老太太从床上拿下来了一条半新不旧的被子，我很不好意思的问她：
    “这没人盖？”
    “没人盖！是多余的一条”她一边说着，一边就向当地铺去。
    “扫一下吧？”我们怕把她的被子弄脏。
    “不用扫啦！快弄好睡！”
    行了一夜军确实是累啦。一躺下来，便迷糊了，只听得老太太的脚步声，在院又响了一阵，便呼呼入睡了。
    第二天，队伍一早出发，我留在后边清理群众手续，三个房检查了一下就剩那座小房的一块门板没有上，我扛着门板，刚走过去，迎脸扑来了一股臭气，一看，确实是个牛圈。
    “怎么！”我发现靠东的一角还躺着一个老人，走近一看是房东老太太，在她的身下，铺着一些渗差不齐的麦秆杆，没有盖被子睡的动也不动。
    “老太太怎么睡在这呢？”这问题在我脑子里旋转起来，我看了看我们睡了全院所有的三座房，又想到同志们铺的席子，铺的被子感到了万分惭愧，自己口对心说：
    “我们有什么理由，不为她们好好的打仗呢？”
