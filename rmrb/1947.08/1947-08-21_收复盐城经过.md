　　Recapture of Yancheng

    Xinhua News Agency, Central China, 19th: A reporter on the Subei Front reported: The Central China People's Liberation Army launched its first powerful counterattack on the central section of the Tongyu Highway on the 7th of this month since the Kuomintang occupation, capturing five strongholds including Wuyu in one fell swoop, and then encircled Yancheng from four directions. On the 8th, it continued to capture four strongholds including Shanggang. By the 11th, the encirclement and preparation for attacking the bridge were completed, and the general attack on Yancheng, surrounded by water on all sides and defended by the Kuomintang puppet troops, was launched.

    At twelve o'clock midnight on the 11th, the People's Liberation Army bombarded Yancheng with various calibers of artillery, heavy and light machine guns, like the earth splitting and the sky collapsing. The Kuomintang puppet troops, trapped in the isolated city, frantically fired red flares and set fire to the Dengying Bridge on the Chuanchan River west of the city. Then the North Street also caught fire, and the flames lit up half the sky. The PLA bugler immediately blew the majestic charge, and the soldiers charged through the fiery North Street in a wave of shouts, crossed the highway, waded through the Yu River, and arrived at the earthen fortress of the North Gate. They then climbed up the earthen fortress like dragons and tigers from three places. The follow-up troops poured in like a tide, engaged the stubborn enemy in bayonet fighting, and even fought the enemy with hand grenades. After more than ten minutes of fighting, the enemy retreated in a panic to the south, but immediately drew a battalion of troops to cooperate with fierce artillery fire to counterattack, and the earthen fortress was reoccupied by the enemy. Before dawn, the People's Liberation Army drove the enemy out of the earthen fortress again and occupied the city defense.

    Under the rising red sun, the People's Liberation Army crossed the water and attacked the city from all sides. The remnants of the enemy, led by Li Tiemin, the division commander of the puppet 42nd Group Army, retreated to the Yancheng Middle School Great Fortress in the northeast corner of the city, to make a final stand. After the People's Liberation Army urged them to lay down their arms automatically to no avail, at twelve o'clock noon on the 12th, dozens of large cannons were concentrated to bombard the enemy fiercely. For a time, bullets rained down, and the fortress became a sea of fire. The Kuomintang puppet troops completely lost their fighting spirit. Li Tiemin fled north in a panic, and the People's Liberation Army bravely pursued and finally captured him. The Kuomintang puppet troops in the fortress also laid down their arms completely.

    After fifteen hours of fierce fighting, this famous city in northern Jiangsu, named after General Ye Ting, finally returned to the embrace of the people after being occupied for more than seven months. (Qing Lun, Dai Huang)

　　收复盐城经过
    【新华社华中十九日电】苏北前线记者报导：收复叶挺（盐城）城歼敌一个师之经过称：本月七日华中蒋后解放军对通榆公路中段发起转入蒋后以来首次强大反击，一举克攻伍佑等五据点，随即四方向叶挺城合围。八日续克上冈等四据点。至十一日完成包围及攻紧架桥准备，开始向这座四面环水由蒋伪军困守的叶挺城，发起总攻。
    十一日午夜十二时，解放军各种口径炮，轻重机枪，天崩地裂般的向叶挺城轰击。困守孤城的蒋伪军慌乱地打着红色照明弹，并放火烧了城西串场河上的登瀛桥，接着北街也烧了起来，火光照红了半边天。解放军号兵随即吹起雄壮的冲锋号，战士们在一片冲杀声中冲过火龙一样的北街，越过公路，涉过圩河，抵达北门土圩，迅即又如生龙活虎一样从三处爬上土圩，后续部队当如潮水涌入，与顽抗的敌人拚刺刀，甚至用手榴弹与敌人撕打。经过十几分钟的搏斗，敌人狼狈向南溃退，但随即抽调一营兵力配合猛烈炮火，作反冲锋，土圩被敌重占。至黎明前，解放军与再度将敌逐出土圩，占领城防。
    在方升起的鲜红的太阳下，解放军越水从四面攻进城关。残敌由伪四十二集团军一师师长李铁民率领，退守城北角盐城中学大圩，作最后顽抗。解放军促其自动放下武器无效后，于十二日中午十二时，集中数十门大炮，向敌猛轰，一时弹如雨下，圩内顿成火海，蒋伪斗志全失，李铁民狼狈向北突围，解放军奋勇追击，终将其俘获，圩内蒋伪军亦全部放下武器。
    经过十五小时激战，这座以叶挺将军命名的苏北名城，在沦陷七个多月后，终于重回人民怀抱。（清伦、戴煌）
