    The Developing Pingshun Cultural Cooperative
    Culture in Pingshun is very backward, especially in the vast mountainous areas of the sixth and seventh districts. In some places, schools have never been established. Seeing a literate person is considered extremely valuable. Textbooks are also severely lacking, and buying paper, ink, and brushes requires traveling very far. In recent years, the masses, through emancipation and great production, have improved their lives and urgently demand culture. The Education Section, to meet the needs of the masses, first solved the supply of cultural food, and decided to establish a cultural cooperative. Experienced teachers such as Chang Zhenji were assigned to this work. First, teachers were mobilized to invest shares, and the public also helped, accumulating a total of 150,000 yuan. It officially started in February of last year. They personally repaired houses and carried new books back. Yue Sumin traveled 180 li every day without feeling tired. Yang Riming looked everywhere for woodcarving workers to reprint elementary school and winter school textbooks. After a year and a half of struggle, in addition to distributing more than 32,000 copies throughout the county, they also sold more than 12,000 copies to the Xinhua Bookstore in Huguan, and reprinted more than 5,000 copies of winter school textbooks. In addition, they continuously carried burdens down to the villages, providing many conveniences to teachers and students. For example, in Datuo Village in the seventh district, there are fifty-seven natural villages, and there is not a single literate person within a forty-li radius. Now, both male and female elementary school students and young people have bought textbooks to learn literacy, and some can already write travel permits and simple letters. The cultural cooperative has made it convenient and inexpensive for people everywhere to buy new books and stationery, so it has developed rapidly. The number of members has increased from 150 to 630, the share capital has increased from 150,000 yuan to 2.03 million yuan, and the number of cadres and miscellaneous personnel has increased from four to twelve. Stone printing and mimeograph machines have also been established. The cultural cooperative has played a considerable role in the development of cultural undertakings in Pingshun. (Long Zhiqing)

    发展中的平顺文化社
    平顺文化很落后，特别是六七区辽阔的山地，有的地方从来未成立过学校，见了个识字人觉着十分宝贵。文县课本也很缺乏，买点纸墨笔要跑很远。几年来群众经过翻身和大生产，生活改善，迫切的要求文化，教育科适应群众需要，首先解决文化食粮的供应，决定成立文化社。配备有经验的教员常振基等担任这一工作，首先发动教员入股，公家又帮助，共积十五万元。于去年二月间正式开始，他们亲自动手修房子，亲往回担新书，岳苏民每天跑一百八十里路，不觉疲劳，杨日明到处找木刻工人翻印小学及冬学课本，在一年半的奋斗下，除发行全县三万二千余本外，又卖到壶关新华书店一万二千余本，又翻印冬学课本五千余本。此外还不断的担担下乡给教员学生很多便利。如七区达驮村，有五十七个自然村，周围四十里路没一个识字人，现在男女小学生和青年都买上了课本学识字，有的已会开路条，写简单信。文化社使各地买新书文具又便利价格又低，因此发展很快。社员已由一百五十名增到六百三十名，股金由十五万元增到二百零三万元，干部及杂务人员由四人增加到十二人，又创办了石印及油印机。文化社在平顺文化事业的开展上，起到相当的作用。（龙之庆）
