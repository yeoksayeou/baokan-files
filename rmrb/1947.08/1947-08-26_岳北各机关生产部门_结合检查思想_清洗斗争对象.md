　　Production Departments of Various Organizations in Northern Yue
  　Combine Ideological Examination to Purge Class Enemies
    [This newspaper, Taiyue, 24th dispatch] Various organizations in Northern Yue have begun to purge the class enemies who have infiltrated their production departments. The first batch of fifty-nine people has been handed over to the masses for handling. On the 15th, a representative meeting of various organizations was held to discuss the second purge, and it was stipulated that the cleanup must be completed before September 15th to completely block this air-raid shelter. Experiences were exchanged at the meeting. This purge must not adopt simple methods, such as simply driving them away. It must be combined with examining one's own landlord ideology and examining production work. Comrade Jiangong of the Military Committee Branch said in his self-criticism: In the past, it was thought that these people had many methods and could make money, but how they made money and how they harmed the interests of the masses were rarely considered. However, after this examination, these guys are "more than destructive, but not productive." The ×× organization is an example. Using 160,000 yuan of capital, the class enemy Wang Chuguo was asked to open a workshop. After half a year of operation, the capital was lost, and only some cigarettes were returned, and revolutionary leaders were openly insulted because the Communist Party led the people to settle accounts for his exploitation. It is necessary to sweep away the landlord ideology that "these people are capable and can make money" and "they have a good attitude towards us" from exposing these facts, and this air-raid shelter can be blocked.

　　岳北各机关生产部门
  　结合检查思想　清洗斗争对象
    【本报太岳二十四日电】岳北各机关已开始清洗混入自己生产部门的斗争对象。第一批有五十九人，已交给群众处理。十五日又召开各机关代表会议，商讨第二次清洗，并规定在九月十五日前清理完毕，彻底堵塞这一防空洞。会上交流经验，此次清洗绝不能采用简单的方法，以赶走为满足，必须与检查自己的地主思想与检查生产工作结合进行，武委分会建功同志检讨时说：过去认为这些人办法多，能赚钱，但究竟如何赚钱，如何危害群众利益，就很少考虑。但此次检查以后，这些家伙是“生产不足，破坏不。”××机关即是一例。用十六万元资本叫斗争对象王楚国去开作坊，经营半年，结果本钱赔完，只交回些纸烟，并公开辱骂革命领袖，因为共产党领导人民清算了他的剥削。必须从揭露这些事实中，把认为“这些人能干能赚钱”“对我们态度好”等等地主思想一扫而光，这一防空洞才能堵死。
