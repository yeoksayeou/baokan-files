Xinhua News Agency, East China Front, 2nd—The East China People's Liberation Army has recently announced reward standards for Chiang Kai-shek's troops who voluntarily return with their weapons. The regulations stipulate that any Chiang Kai-shek officers and soldiers who understand righteousness and voluntarily return with their weapons, if their families are in the KMT-controlled areas and wish to return home, will be given sufficient travel expenses to help them return home. If their families are in the liberated areas, their families may be allocated land, depending on the size of the returnee's contribution, after discussion and agreement by the local government and people. Those who have no family or do not wish to return home can be helped to find employment. The amount of bonus is specified according to the type of weapon carried, such as 3,000 North Sea currency for each rifle (equivalent to 60,000 KMT currency), and 15,000 North Sea currency for each light machine gun (equivalent to 300,000 KMT currency), which will be paid in full by the local government or troops in charge of the negotiations.
Xinhua News Agency, Liaodong, 2nd—Song Kaihong, deputy squad leader of the fourth squad of the second platoon of the third company of the first battalion of the 14th Regiment of the 15th Division of the Chiang Kai-shek puppet army entrenched in the Dashiqiao line in the southern section of the Changchun Railway, led all eight soldiers of the squad with full arms and two machine gun repair tools to surrender to a certain unit of the Democratic Allied Army on the 12th of last month, and was warmly welcomed.
