  　Late Planting Due to Drought, First Weeding Must Be Grasped Tightly!
    Thorough and Voluntary Rectification of Mutual Aid: 140,000 Mu Completed in Ten Days

    [Our Newspaper Wu'an Dispatch] The Fourth District experienced late planting this year due to drought. In order to quickly complete the weeding, before the hoe touched the seedlings, more than 900 people, including party members and activists who had turned over, were convened in meetings based on key points to discuss how to rectify mutual aid. After the meetings, the villages immediately organized new mutual aid groups through the personal connections of party members, cadres, and activists. According to a total of 32 villages, out of 4,019 full and semi-laborers, 3,118 have been organized, accounting for 77 percent. Of the 4,036 female laborers, 1,587 are participating in weeding, accounting for 39 percent. This mutual aid truly achieved a voluntary combination with poor and hired peasants as the backbone. Most of the group leaders are party members, cadres, and activists. Among the 26 mutual aid group leaders in Jingu Village, eight are the village's main cadres, and the remaining 18 are all poor and hired peasant activists. As the mutual aid groups took the poor and hired peasants as their backbone, landlords were squeezed out of the mutual aid groups, with a total of 640 landlords being purged from the entire district. Since the expulsion of the landlords, everyone's morale has been extremely high, and labor efficiency has been unprecedentedly improved. In the weeding process, each full or semi-laborer in Zhaodian Village can weed an average of 1.7 mu per work day. The Xiwanshan militia group, consisting of six full laborers and five semi-laborers, weeded 20 mu of millet seedlings in one day, an average of 1.9 mu per person. Xun Lao Chen's group, the director of the Shangshanli Farmers' Association, weeded 30 mu in one day with 15 people, amounting to 2 mu per work day. The masses said after cleaning out the landlords: "They are all our own people, so happy!" In order to absorb semi-laborers and stimulate production enthusiasm, commendations and work point systems were implemented. In the past, the groups in Guo'erzhuang did not want children, but later each group implemented a work point system based on the quality and speed of each person's work every day, and children and women all participated in mutual aid. After the implementation of the work point system in Zhao Dian Wu Ruyi's group, veteran soldier Lao Yang also became active. 108 women in Zhaodian weeded 440 mu of miscellaneous fields in eight days; 114 children weeded 610 mu of seedlings, amounting to half a mu per person per day, giving full play to the role of semi-laborers. Cui Aiqing's group of five women weeded 24 mu in seven days, amounting to 0.7 mu per person per day. The He Yueting group of women in Shangshanli is even more exemplary, with seven people weeding 22 mu in three days, amounting to more than 1 mu per work day. An old man in Zhaodian Third Street said with emotion: "I can't keep up, I'm not as good as a woman!" The Sixth Group in Xiasanli was not enthusiastic at the beginning, but after commendation, nine people weeded ten mu of millet seedlings and two mu of corn in the second day, and now it has become a model group in the village.

    In short, the mutual aid movement in the Fourth District, due to the bold and unconstrained rectification, resolute breaking of the old organization, the leadership of party members and cadres, the poor and hired peasants as the backbone, a complete separation from the landlords, and the absorption of women, children, and semi-laborers, all 90,000 mu of millet seedlings and more than 50,000 mu of miscellaneous grains in the district were weeded for the first time within ten days.

  　天旱下种迟，头锄要抓紧！
    彻底自愿整顿互助  十四万亩十天完成
    【本报武安讯】四区今年因旱下种迟，为了迅速完成锄苗，在锄头遍苗前，就先后按基点召开了党员和翻身积极分子九百余人会议，讨论如何整顿互助。会后，各村即以党员、干部积极分子亲自串通了新的互助组。现据卅二个村总计，四千零十九个全半劳力，已组织起三千一百一十八个，占百分之七十七，妇女劳力四千零三十六个，参加锄苗的有一千五百八十七个，占百分之三十九。这次互助，真做到以贫雇为骨干的自愿结合，组长大部是党员、干部、积极分子。近古村的二十六个互助组长，村主要干部有八个，其余十八个也全是贫雇积极分子。随着互助组以贫雇为骨干，就把地主从互助组中挤出去，计全区清洗出地主六百四十个。自挤出地主后，大家情绪极端高涨，劳动效率空前提高，锄苗中赵店村全半劳力每工平均能锄一亩七分，西万山民兵组六个正劳力，五个半劳力，一天锄谷苗二十亩，每人平均一亩九，下山里农会主任巽老陈组，十五人一天锄苗三十亩，一工合二亩。群众对清洗地主后都说：“都是咱自己人了，多痛快！”为了吸收半劳力和刺激生产情绪，开始实行表扬和订分，郭二庄以前各组不要儿童，后来各组每天按各人做活好坏快慢实行订分，儿童妇女都参加了互助。赵店伍入义组，实行订分后，荣退军人老杨也积极起来了，赵店妇女一百零八人，八天锄了杂田四百四十亩；儿童一百一十四人，锄苗六百一十亩，每人一天合半亩，发挥了半劳力的作用，崔爱清组五个妇女，七天锄苗二十四亩，每人一天合七分。上山里妇女何月廷组更模范，七个人三天锄地二十二亩，一工合一亩多，赵店三街一个老汉感动的说：“咱吃不开了，还不如个妇女！”下三里第六组开始不起劲，经过表扬，第二天九个人锄了十亩谷苗、二亩玉茭，现在成为全村模范组。
    总之四区互助运动，由于大胆放手整顿，坚决打破编制，党员干部带头，贫雇为骨干，彻底和地主分家，又吸收妇女、儿童半劳力，全区九万亩谷苗和五万多亩杂粮，十天之内，便全部把头遍锄出来了。（鲁林、耀南）
