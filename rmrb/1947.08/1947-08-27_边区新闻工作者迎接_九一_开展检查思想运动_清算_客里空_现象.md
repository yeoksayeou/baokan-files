　　边区新闻工作者迎接“九一”
    开展检查思想运动
  　清算“客里空”现象
    【新华社晋冀鲁豫二十三日电】此间新闻工作者正以紧张的学习，展开检查思想运动，迎接“九一”节。新华社晋冀鲁豫总分社于本月十五日即向太行、太岳、冀南、冀鲁豫各分社及报纸发出通知，号召在“九一”前掀起学习热潮，配合全区查阶级查思想，来检查为农民服务的阶级立场及清算“客里空”现象，更好的为人民的新闻事业服务。并指出应着重：（一）公开的清算一切闻工作者（包括通讯员）在报导土地改革中地主阶级思想的各种表现。表扬坚决拥护农民利益的新闻干部，揭发利用党报打击群运的隐蔽地主分子。（二）内外勤在写稿编稿中所有的“客里空”事实进行深刻反省。（三）具体研究今后如何为农民服务，成为党与农民的真正喉舌。现总分社及边区人民日报全体干部正分头进行，太行新华日报社及太行分社召开的通讯员大会已就上述各点进行检查，发现不少问题。
