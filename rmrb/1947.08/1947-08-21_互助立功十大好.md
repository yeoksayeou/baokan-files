　　Ten Benefits of Mutual Assistance for Merit
　　By Bi Gefei, Special Class Hero of the Taiyue Military Region
　　Editor's Note: This article was written by Comrade Bi Gefei, head of the Propaganda Section of the Political Department of the Taiyue Military Region. Comrade Gefei has been selected as a special class hero among cadres at the merit recognition conference in the region. He personally led the transformation of two propaganda teams and made continuous contributions to the political work of the military region's troops. Jiao Wubao, the famous battle mutual assistance hero of the border region, was discovered by him.
　　Comrade Gefei's article is based on summaries of conversations with many mutual assistance group leaders and members. It was written as a clapper talk and then recited to soldiers in companies for their opinions and revisions. It was recited and revised repeatedly. Therefore, the soldiers said, "These are all our own affairs. We do it but don't know how to say it. It's best to teach us with our own things, which can quickly improve us. We must study hard and work hard..." They also said, "Reciting this clapper talk is better than many political lessons." Therefore, it is published here for adoption by political and cultural workers in the troops and for reference by local literary and art workers.

　　(1)
　　Everyone says mutual assistance for merit is good, and indeed, there are many benefits.
　　If you want me to express it, I can express it in ten or so ways.
　　Battle mutual assistance is the first good thing, with big victories and small casualties.
　　Small group activities are very flexible, emphasizing tactics is very necessary.
　　Enemy and our firepower are both very heavy, dense formations can't withstand it.
　　A squad is too big as a unit, and a single soldier is too few.
　　A group is a small collective, just right, not too many, not too few.
　　Less casualties when hit by artillery shells, and able to exert strength when charging.
　　Develop in depth to capture prisoners, and seize guns and cannons to earn merit.

　　(2)
　　Let me express the second good thing, united mutual assistance with high ambitions.
　　Eight immortals crossing the sea, each displaying their abilities, combined into a set.
　　Old soldiers have good traditions, brave, tenacious, and highly conscious.
　　Liberated soldiers have good skills, and know the details of tenacity.
　　Turned-over peasants joined the army, with enthusiasm, positivity, and good morale.
　　If the three goods are combined into one, it's fantastic.
　　Promote each person's strengths, and shortcomings must also be removed.
　　A good way to learn from each other's strengths and make up for weaknesses, teaching each other.
　　Three people are as good as Zhuge Liang, the collection of advantages is amazing.
　　If the whole company has mutual assistance, see how many Kongmings there are.

　　(3)
　　I'll talk about the third good thing about mutual assistance, small courage turns into great courage.
　　Three people working with one heart, every soldier is brave.
　　Look at our group of three, the courage is three times greater.
　　Three people form a unit, and three threes can top nine.
　　If three people are divided into three places, the strength seems too weak.
　　If a squad is squeezed together, casualties are great under artillery fire.
　　Mutual assistance is mobile and flexible, with ways to eliminate the enemy.

　　(4)
　　Battle mutual assistance is the fourth good thing, new soldiers can also earn merit in battle.
　　Old soldiers lead new soldiers, teaching while fighting.
　　New soldiers have high morale before the battle, determined to fight and earn merit.
　　Vowing to defend Chairman Mao and protect the fruits of victory to repay the kindness.
　　Eager to capture dozens of prisoners at once, anxious to seize guns and cannons.
　　Once on the battlefield, the guns and cannons sound, confused and dizzy.
　　Bullets whizzing overhead, with booming cannons all around.
　　Feeling only four fingers away from the head, at most a hand's breadth.
　　So scared that they don't dare to lift their heads, sticking their butts up high.
　　Forgetting to seize guns and capture prisoners, forgetting the determination to earn merit.
　　Old soldiers quickly explain, providing guidance in thought.
　　Explaining the situation to boost courage, dispelling fear and supporting them.
　　Thinking of ways to fight the enemy, have your grenades ready.
　　The enemy suddenly counterattacks, a volley of shots sends them running back.
　　New soldiers see the enemy is easy to deal with, and gradually their courage grows.
　　The more they fight, the higher their morale, and they can earn merit in the first battle.
　　New soldiers rely on mutual assistance in combat, the battlefield is a good school.
　　Select models integrating combat and teaching, Jiao Wubao is second to none.

　　(5)
　　Battle mutual assistance is the fifth good thing, cadres' casualties are definitely reduced.
　　Mutual assistance groups are well organized, and combat enthusiasm is improved.
　　Organize assault teams, with one, two, and three names volunteering automatically.
　　The assault group leader is at the front, leading by example.
　　Determined to earn merit with high morale, organization is tight and thorough.
　　As soon as they hear the charge signal, they rush forward like wolves and tigers.
　　Saying to attack there, they get there, no need for cadres to worry.
　　Avoiding cadres running back and forth, anxiously supervising.
　　Running back and forth is not a big deal, but injury and sacrifice are not good.
　　Weakening command and leadership, the troops will definitely have smaller victories.
　　It's not that we're afraid of casualties, but these casualties are unnecessary.
　　The command position can be well maintained, taking care of the overall situation.
　　Grasping every opportunity tightly, and the coordination is wonderful.
　　One squad detours to encircle, one squad guts the middle.
　　You arrive, I arrive, and he arrives too, the enemy can't escape.
　　Everyone says the company commander commands well, with tactics and love for soldiers.
　　Big victories and small casualties, ultimately due to mutual assistance.

　　(6)
　　Ideological mutual assistance is the sixth good thing, the troops are consolidated and there are no desertions.
　　Doing work in mutual assistance groups is widespread, in-depth, and specific.
　　Marching together in the whole group, fighting together as well.
　　Sleeping shoulder to shoulder at night, and sitting together in class.
　　Living together all day long, understanding thoughts most thoroughly.
　　Sharing pork when there is some, climbing mountains hungry together.
　　Sharing hardship and enjoyment together, sharing life and death, inseparable.
　　Although actions are the same, there are changes in thoughts.
　　Some become stronger in training, others lower their heads.
　　Some feel that suffering and bleeding for the people is most glorious.
　　Some feel that suffering this kind of hardship is foolish.
　　Therefore, he grumbles, is pessimistic, and wants to go home.
　　The mutual assistance group sees through him, explaining and doing work at any time.
　　Casually talking intimate words, comparing oneself to others.
　　"How did I make plans before, I'm not afraid of difficulties."
　t seem like explaining and doing work, heart-to-heart mutual assistance has a great effect.
　　His heart is moved, and ideological struggle is like fighting.
　　Everyone is vying to be a hero, how can I be a good-for-nothing?
　　From then on, he made up his mind, not returning home until old Chiang is overthrown.
　　Ideological mutual assistance has a great effect, turning pessimism into positivity.
　　Not grumbling or wanting to go home, determined to earn merit by killing the enemy.

　　(7)
　　Marching mutual assistance is the seventh good thing, no one falls behind.
　　The Eighth Route Army fights mobile warfare, marching far to fight.
　　Some are strong and walk fast, others are weak and fall behind.
　　There are also individual lazybones, becoming "ancestors" of falling behind.
　　Not saying their stomach doesn't hurt on the march, but bending over as soon as they set off.
　　Since mutual assistance has been done well, this phenomenon has been eliminated.
　　Planning to march without falling behind, definitely achieving what is said.
　　Physical strength mutual assistance helps carry guns, everyone is vying to do it.
　　If a group has someone falling behind, the second group hurries to carry the gun on their shoulders.
　　The comrades in the first group see it, feeling like they're losing face.
　　Quickly hurrying forward to grab the gun, only happy when they carry it themselves.
　　This kind of enthusiastic scene of mutual assistance.
　　Moves the "ancestor" of falling behind.
　　Secretly watching all the time, calculating in his heart.
　　People are carrying two guns, everyone is vying to do it.
　　I often fall behind walking empty-handed, the more I think about it, the more uneasy I feel.
　　Don't know where that energy comes from, walking with extra joy in both legs.
　　Reaching out to grab the gun, carrying it and catching up with his squad.
　　The falling-behind ancestor can transform, the benefits of mutual assistance are more obvious.

　　(8)
　　Training mutual assistance is the eighth good thing, learning morale is especially high.
　　Going to class and doing exercises, the group leaders supervise well.
　　After class and after exercises, each group goes to do extra exercises.
　　Individual coaches are very clever, whoever knows the set teaches it.
　　Officers teach soldiers, and soldiers teach soldiers, everyone learns and everyone teaches.
　　Learning skills and literacy, and of course, current affairs and politics are indispensable.
　　Praising those who learn actively, and criticizing those with low morale.
　　The method seems old-fashioned, but the mutual assistance group is newly created.
　　Organizing work is more meticulous, and the mass line is well implemented.
　　A squad can have three groups, and the squad can pick battles within.
　　Short, sharp, and well-organized, competition is flexible.
　　Easy to mobilize and easy to summarize, not afraid of starting but not finishing.
　　Not only can there be big competitions, but also comparing highs and lows in each subject.
　　If grenade throwing is not good, compete in grenade throwing, improving against shortcomings.
　　Who doesn't want to be good? Who is "impressed" by a tortoise?
　　As soon as competition is mentioned, energy comes? Getting up early and working hard.
　　Throwing grenades until arms ache, the group puts forward a new slogan.
　　"Rather have arms ache from throwing grenades, than face burn from competition"
　　The slogan is cleverly put forward, and everyone's morale is even higher.
　　Training so the arm doesn't hurt anymore, the more they throw, the more they feel it's fun.
　　Striving for first place is fantastic, everyone has generally improved.

　　(9)
　　Discipline mutual assistance is the ninth good thing, mutual supervision is very important.
　　Party policies are all said to be good, uniting the masses is a treasure.
　　Implementing policies relies on self-awareness, but people often have unexpected moments.
　　Entering a city, not violating the slightest thing should be done.
　　Making resolutions and setting plans before the battle, the plans are well set.
　　Once entering the county town, eyes turn red seeing things.
　　Seeing a flashlight, feeling that he needs it very much.
　　Going on a search in the dark night, able to shine a light in the house.
　　Guarding and standing sentry, shining on the target, how convenient.
　　Thinking of taking it, but can't do "not violating the slightest thing."
　　Saying to bear not taking it, feeling itchy in his heart.
　　If I don't take it, someone else will, I'm such a fool.
　　Thinking back and forth, it's good to take it, reaching out and tucking it into his waist.
　　The squad leader doesn't see it, and "not violating the slightest thing" is violated.
　　The group acts together, seeing him reach out and saying:
　　"Before the battle, our group made a plan, not taking a single hair entering the city.
　　We are saving the people, discipline and policies must be done well.
　　If you take a rotten flashlight, the plan becomes empty talk."
　　The light dims with a slight push, and he doesn't take it as soon as it's said.
　　After the war, a merit evaluation meeting is held, and everyone says you have good discipline entering the city.
　　Entering the city empty-handed and leaving empty-handed, "not violating the slightest thing" is all done.
　　For the sake of defending Chairman Mao, not getting rich, earning military merit.

　　(10)
　　Earning merit mutual assistance is the tenth good thing, implementing plans can be done.
　　People often have hot and cold illnesses, getting confused encountering difficulties.
　　If mutual assistance is done well, these shortcomings are all sold off.
　　Zhang San suddenly has a cold illness, Li Si is burning like fire.
　　Li Si lowers his head encountering difficulties, Zhang San raises his head again.
　　"Comrade! Comrade, don't lower your head, show heroism in the face of difficulties.
　　Before the war, we made a plan, defending the savior and earning merit.
　　What is said must be done, people will laugh if there's empty talk."
　　Mutual assistance supervises and encourages, turning cold into hot, low into high.
　　Thinking of ways to continue doing it, the determination and plan don't change.
　　There are many changes in the middle of battle, encountering several difficulties.
　　Individual heroes are not good, mutual assistance can earn merit.
　　This principle must be explained clearly, a story makes it clear.
　　Fighting Fencheng on June 1st, the Xiaocun battle was fought well.
　　The Third Company fought into the village, an enemy was running on the street.
　　Yuan Wanming pounced on him, grabbing the rifle and telling him to surrender.
　　Yuan Wanming is a little hero, with a thin body and small stature.
　　Encountering this stubborn egg, with a body like a rolling pin and a tall stature.
　　The stubborn guy meets a hero, if he doesn't surrender his gun, his life will be difficult to spare.
　　But as the saying goes, big rats can bite cats.
　　The stubborn fellow doesn't surrender the gun, you fight and snatch, unable to break away.
　　At the critical moment, Comrade Wu Laihui ran over.
　　Seeing things weren't good, he shot the stubborn fellow down.
　　Wu Laihui killed an enemy, Yuan Wanming seized a gun.
　　This is called mutual assistance on the battlefield at any time, mutual assistance earns merit.

　　×　　　　　　×　　　　　　×
　　The ten benefits are finished, and there are many smaller benefits.
　　In a word, mutual assistance is good, good, good.
　　Various works pass through it, and everyone is responsible with high morale.
　　The mass line is specific, and the meticulous organization is more thorough.
　　In the future, it must be promoted even more, widespread mutual assistance earns merit.
　　Earning great merits in the counter-offensive, people's heroes are gloriously marked.

　　互助立功十大好
    太岳特等功臣  毕革飞作
    编者按：此文为太岳军区政治部宣传科长毕革飞同志所作。革飞同志已在该区功臣会上，被选为机关干部特等功臣。他曾亲手领导改造过两宣传队，对于军区部队政治工作亦迭有建树，名满边区的战斗互助英雄焦五保，即为其所发现者。
    革飞同志此文，系根据与许多互助组长与组员谈话的总结，写成快板后，又到连队念给战士们听，请战士们提意见修改，念了又改，改了又念，因此战士们都说：“这都是我们自己的事，我们做了不会说，拿我们的东西教我们最好，能很快的提高我们，一定好好学，好好干………”又说：“念这快板不知道顶上多少次政治课。”故特发表于此，以供部队政治文化工作者之采用，并作地方文艺工作者之参考。
　　（一）
    都说互助立功好，的确好处真不少。
    要让我来把它表，我能表他十来条。
    战斗互助第一好，胜利大来伤亡小。
    小组活动真灵活，讲究战术很需要。
    敌我火力都很重，队形密集受不了。
    班为单位人太多，光杆一个又太少。
    一组一个小集团，不多不少那正好。
    一上炮弹伤亡小，冲锋又能把劲使。
    纵深发展捉俘虏，缴枪缴炮立功劳。
　　（二）
    我再来表第二好，同心互助志谋高。
    八仙过海各显能，集中起来成一套。
    老战士、传统好，英勇顽强觉悟高。
    解放战士技术好，顽强内情他知道。
    翻身农民参了军，热情积极情绪好。
    三好要是合一好，狗猪鸭子呱呱叫。
    各人长处发扬了，短处也得要去掉。
    取长补短好办法，互相学习互相教。
    三人顶个诸葛亮，优点集合不得了。
    全连要是都互助，你看孔明有多少。
　　（三）
    互助三好我再谈，小胆互助变大胆。
    三人干的一股劲，个个战士都勇敢。
    你看咱组人三个，胆子就有三个大。
    三人结成一圪塔，三三就能顶九个。
    若是三人分三下，力量显得太单薄。
    一班挤在一圪塔，炮火底下伤亡大。
    互助机动又灵活，消灭敌人有办法。
　　（四）
    战斗互助第四好，新兵打仗也能立功劳。
    老兵带领新战士，一边打仗一边教。
    新兵战前情绪高，决心战斗立功劳。
    口口声声保卫毛主席，保卫果实把恩报。
    恨不得一下俘虏几十个，心急火燎缴枪炮。
    一到战场枪炮响，迷三倒四头昏了。
    子弹吱吱头上叫，轰轰一直响大炮。
    只觉离头只四指，顶多一扎远不了。
    吓的头也不敢抬，屁股撅的特别高。
    忘了缴枪捉俘虏，忘了决心立功劳。
    老兵赶快做解释，思想方面做诱导。
    说明情形壮壮胆，解除恐惧撑撑腰。
    想出办法打敌人，你把手榴弹准备好。
    敌人一下反扑来，一排子打的他往回跑。
    新战士看见敌人稀松劲，慢慢他就胆壮了
    越打他越情绪高，头仗就能立功劳。
    新兵作战靠互助，战场就是好学校。
    战教合一选模范，首屈一指焦五保。
　　（五）
    战斗互助第五好，干部伤亡一定少。
    互助组，组织好，战斗积极性都提高。
    组织冲锋突击队，一二三名自动报。
    冲锋组长在前头，模范行动来领导。
    决心立功情绪高，组织严密又周到。
    只要一听冲锋号，如狼似虎往前跑。
    说打到那就到那，不用干部心急燥。
    免得干部前后跑，心急火燎来督导。
    前后跑跑不要紧，负伤牺牲就不妙。
    减弱指挥和领导，部队一定胜利小。
    这倒不是怕伤亡，这样伤亡不必要。
    指挥位置能站好，全面情况都顾到。
    各个火候抓的紧，协同合作妙又妙。
    一排迂回大包围，一排中间把心掏。
    你到我到他也到，敌人想跑跑不了。
    都说连长指挥好，战术爱兵呱呱叫。
    胜利大来伤亡小，归根还数互助好。
　　（六）
    思想互助第六好，部队巩固没逃跑。
    互助组里做工作，普遍深入具体化。
    行军全组一块走，打仗也在一块打。
    黑夜睡觉膀靠膀，上课也在一块坐。
    整天生活一圪塔，思想摸的最透澈。
    有了猪肉大家吃，饿肚爬山一块爬。
    共同吃苦同享乐，同生共死不分家。
    虽然行动是一样，思想里头有变化。
    有的锻炼更坚强，有的就把头低下。
    有的觉得为人民吃苦流血最光荣。
    有的觉得受这洋罪是傻瓜。
    因此他就跌二话，悲观失望想回家。
    互助组里看透他，随时解释做工作。
    随便谈谈知心话，将己比人拉一拉。
    “以前我怎订计划，遇了困难我不怕”。
    看样不象解释做工作，谈心互助作用大。
    他的心里受感动，思想斗争象打架。
    大家争着当功臣，难道我愿当日弄货。
    自此他把决心下，不打倒老蒋不回家。
    思想互助作用大，悲观变成积极啦。
    不跌二话不想家，决心立功把敌杀。
　　（七）
    行军互助第七好，没有一个把队掉。
    八路军打的运动战，打仗走的路子远。
    有的身强走的快，有的体弱后边掉。
    也有个别油腻鬼，当了掉队“老祖先”
    不说行军肚不疼，一说出发把腰弯。
    自从互助搞的好，这种现象全消灭。
    计划行军不掉队，说到做到定实现。
    体力互助帮背枪，大家都是争着干。
    一组有个掉队的，二组急忙把枪背上肩。
    一组同志一看见，好象自己太丢脸。
    快忙上前去争枪，自己背上才喜欢。
    这种互助热情的好场面。
    感动了掉队“老祖先”。
    眼睛偷偷一直看，心里暗暗自盘算。
    人家背着两支枪，大家都是争着干。
    我这空走常掉队，越想心里越不安。
    也不知那来的那股劲，两条腿走的分外欢。
    伸手把枪夺过来，扛上跟上了自己的班。
    掉队老祖先能转变，互助好处更明显。
　　（八）
    整训互助第八好，学习情绪特别高。
    上动课了出动操，各组组长督促的好。
    课前课后收了操，各组又去出小操。
    各别教练多灵巧，谁会那套谁就教。
    官教兵来兵教兵，人人学习个个教。
    又学技术又认字，时事政治当然少不了。
    学习积极就表扬，情绪不高的就检讨。
    方法好象老一套，互助小组是新创造。
    组织工作更细密，群众路线走的好。
    一班能有三个组，班内就能把战挑。
    短小精悍有组织，竞赛起来又灵巧。
    又好发动又好总结，不怕有头没尾放空炮。
    不但能有大竞赛，一门一门比低高。
    投弹不好赛投弹，针对缺点来提高。
    那个心里不想好？谁对乌龟也不“感冒”？
    一说竞赛劲来了？起早搭黑出小操。
    投弹投的胳膊疼，组里提出新口号。
    “能叫投弹臂发疼，不叫竞赛脸发烧”
    口号提的真巧妙，大家情绪更提高。
    练的臂也不痛了，越投越觉有味道。
    争取了第一呱呱叫，大家普遍进步了。
　　（九）
    纪律互助第九好，互助督促很重要。
    党的政策都说好，团结群众是件宝。
    执行政策靠自觉，人又常有个想不到。
    打进一个城内，秋毫无犯应做到。
    战前下决心订计划，计划上边订的好。
    一旦打进县城内，看见东西眼红了。
    看见一个手电灯，觉着自己很需要。
    黑夜打仗去搜索，进到家里能照一照。
    站岗放哨照目标，多么方便多么好。
    心想把它拿上吧，“秋毫无犯”做不到。
    再说忍心不拿吧，心里觉着怪痒搔。
    我要不拿旁人拿，咱这傻瓜多糟糕。
    反想正想拿上好，伸手拿上捺到腰。
    班长一下看不到，“秋毫无犯”就犯了。
    小组行动在一块，看见伸手开言道：
    “战前咱组订计划，进城不拿一根毛。
    我们为了救人民，纪律政策定做好。
    你要拿个烂手电，计划成了放空炮。”
    灯暗只用人一拨，一说他就不拿了。
    战后召开评功会，都说你们入城纪律好。
    空手进城空手出，“秋毫无犯”全作到。
    为了保卫毛主席，不发洋财立功军。
　　（十）
    立功互助第十好，贯澈计划能作到。
    人常有个冷热病，遇了困难迷了窍。
    互助要是搞的好，这些缺点全报销。
    张三忽然发冷病，李四热的象火烧。
    李四遇困难低了头，张三脑袋又抬的高。
    “同志！同志莫低头，困难面前显英豪。
    战前咱们订计划，保卫救星立功劳。
    说到一定要做到，放了空炮人要笑。”
    互助督促一鼓劲，冷的变热低变高。
    再想办法继续干，决心计划变不了。
    战斗中间变化多，困难能遇好几遭。
    个人英雄不算好，互助才能立功劳。
    这个道理要说清，说个故事就明了。
    六月一号打汾城，孝村战斗打的好。
    三连打进村里头，一个敌人街上跑。
    原万明一下扑上去，夺着步枪叫他缴。
    原万明是个小英雄，身体单薄个子小。
    遇了这个顽固蛋，身如碌轴个又高。
    顽固遇见英雄汉，若不缴枪命难饶。
    可是常言讲的好，老鼠大了能咬猫。
    顽固家伙不缴枪，你争我夺不开交。
    正在紧要三关上，毋来会同志跑来了。
    他看事情不大好，一枪把顽固就撩倒。
    毋来会打死一敌人，原万明夺了枪一条。
    这叫战场随时互助，互助起来立功劳。
　　×　　　　　　×　　　　　　×
    十大好处说完了，小的好处更不少。
    总而言之一句话，互助起来好好好。
    各种工作透过它，大家负责情绪高。
    群众路线具体化，细密组织更周到。
    今后更要发扬他，普遍互助立功劳。
    反攻中间立大功，人民功臣美名标。
