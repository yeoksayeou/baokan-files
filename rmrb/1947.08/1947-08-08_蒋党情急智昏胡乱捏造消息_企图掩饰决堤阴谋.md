Xinhua News Agency, Jinji-Luyu, 6th—The Chiang Kai-shek propaganda machine, the Central News Agency, has been slandering the People's Liberation Army for days, falsely accusing them of sabotaging the Yellow River dyke repairs and rescue efforts in an attempt to conceal its conspiracy of breaching the dyke and shift the responsibility. In its frenzy and foolishness, it even issued a so-called "Emergency Telegram from Heze" on the 1st of this month, reporting that Liu Bocheng's troops had concentrated the 1st, 6th, and 7th Columns to attack Linpu City on the 2nd, and "dug the dyke" between the old city and Dongkou. People here couldn't help but chuckle upon hearing this. The Central News Agency actually reported news of the 2nd on the 1st. The clumsiness of its fabrication is both pathetic and laughable. All the Yellow River-related reports issued by the Central News Agency are fabricated rumors, which can be said to have fallen apart on their own.

    蒋党情急智昏胡乱捏造消息
    企图掩饰决堤阴谋
    【新华社晋冀鲁豫六日电】蒋记造谣公司中央社以连日诬蔑解放军破坏黄河修堤抢险，借以掩饰其决堤阴谋，并图推诿责任，情急智昏，竟于本月一日发出一“菏泽特发急电”报导刘伯承部二日集中一、六、七、三个纵队围攻临濮城并在旧城、董口间“掘堤”，此间人士闻之不禁哑然失笑，中央社竟于一日报导二日消息，其造谣之拙劣，可怜亦复可笑。中央社发出所有有关黄河报导，全系乱造谣言，自此可谓不攻自破。
