Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 20th. According to the Tianjin Ta Kung Pao on July 22nd, "Japan's planned exports this year are headed by cotton cloth and textiles, accounting for slightly less than half of the total. Second is raw silk and rayon, accounting for about a quarter. Machinery accounts for one-tenth. The rest are ceramics, glass, aquatic products, and medicines. Looking at this table, it is a miniature of Japan's pre-war export items. It is a variety of weapons used by a light industrial country to carry out economic aggression against colonies and semi-colonies." As for the regulations on goods imported from China, "the largest item is cotton, followed by wool, which together account for one-fifth, followed by minerals. China can supply soybeans, sugar, and salt, which account for about one-twelfth of Japan's planned imports. There is also coal and iron. Looking at this table, China exports raw materials to Japan, which is a typical colonial economy." The newspaper commented: "This year's trade with Japan will inevitably go beyond the scope of the previous barter trade, opening the door to let cheap Japanese goods flood the Chinese market, adding a big bug that specializes in eating domestic products in addition to the invincible American goods... In the future, China's foreign markets will inevitably be captured by Japanese goods one by one. Japan will definitely monopolize the textile market in Southeast Asia. Chinese raw silk has long been defeated by Japanese silk. China's ceramic and lacquerware markets have also been taken away by Japan. Our export commodities were previously locked in some food, tung oil, bristles, soybeans, tea and special minerals. In the future, we will still be tied to this typical colonial trade frame, at a loss. Japanese goods are like a tight hoop, tightly binding China, and unwilling to relax at all." The newspaper said: "China (referring to the Chiang government) has no basic policy, and listens to others (referring to the United States) for orders on prosperity or submission, which is tantamount to trapping the country's destiny in the pre-war Sino-Japanese relations."

　　津大公报评蒋党对日贸易
    中日关系又象战前说兴说跪都听美国
    【新华社陕北二十日电】据七月二十二日天津大公报披露：“日本今年计划输出的第一位纱布及纤维品，占全厂之半弱。其次生丝及人造丝，约占四分之一。机器占十分之一。其余便是些陶瓷、玻璃、水产物及药品等。看这张表，正是战前日本输出项目的缩影。是一个轻工业国家，对殖民地半殖民地实施经济侵略的各种武器。”至规定从中国输入货物，“最大宗是棉花，其次是羊毛，二者合计占五分之一，再次是矿产等。中国可以供给的象大豆、糖、盐，在日本计划中，约占输入十二分之一。还有煤铁。看这张表，中国对日输出的是原料，典型的殖民地经济。”该报评称：“今年对日贸易，势将越出前此以货易货阶段的范围，大开方便之门，让便宜的日货汜滥中国市场，除无敌的美货外，平添个专吃国货的大虫来。……今后中国的国外市场，势将一一被日货攻陷。南洋纺织品市场，日本一定垄断。中国生丝早已被日丝打倒。中国的陶瓷漆器市场，也早被日本夺去了。我们的外销商品，过去被封锁在一些食料品、桐油、猪鬃、大豆，茶及特产矿物，今后仍将被捆在这个殖民地典型的贸易框里，一筹莫展。日货活象一个紧箍，箍得中国紧紧，一点不肯放松。”该报说：“中国（指蒋政府）无基本政策，说兴说跪，悉听人家（指美国）口令，不啻自陷国运于战前中日关系的圈套中去。”
