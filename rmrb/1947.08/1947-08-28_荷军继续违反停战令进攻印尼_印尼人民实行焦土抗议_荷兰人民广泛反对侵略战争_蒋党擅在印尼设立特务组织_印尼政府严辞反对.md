Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 24th: Yogyakarta dispatch: Indonesian Republic Prime Minister Sjahrir issued a statement on the 22nd, exposing the Dutch troops' barbaric violation of the ceasefire order and continued launching offensives. Since the ceasefire order was issued, Dutch troops have advanced 30 to 90 miles in East Java, approximately 90 miles in West Java, approximately 45 miles in Central Java, and approximately 25 miles in Sumatra. Dutch authorities are also reimplementing acts of terror in the occupied areas. According to an Associated Press report on the 21st, Dutch high-ranking officials stated: Dutch troops will expand military operations in Indonesia.

Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 23rd: Batavia dispatch: According to the Dutch military intelligence, acts of sabotage and work slowdowns in the Dutch-occupied areas of Java are increasing daily. Indonesian people in northern Sumatra are also widely implementing a scorched earth policy, and many Dutch farms and factories have been destroyed, including the world's largest Palembang tea factory and the Tanjung Pura large vegetable oil factory. The White Cross Farm in Salatiga, Java, was also set on fire by striking workers on August 19th. The slowdown movement in the Surakarta and Bogor areas is expanding.

Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 23rd: The Hague dispatch: According to the Dutch "De Groene Amsterdammer" magazine, many people's organizations representing all levels of Dutch society oppose the Beel government's decision to rekindle the war of aggression against Indonesia. Labor Party members who previously supported Beel no longer support the current government. The Dutch Labor Party's official newspaper "Het Vrije Volk" pointed out: The Dutch colonialists' bloody cleansing of Indonesian areas through "suppression" and so-called "police actions," and the conspiracy to divide the interior of Sumatra to isolate the Republic, are extremely dangerous. Discussing the situation in the Dutch-occupied areas, the "Handelsblad" newspaper revealed: The situation in the Dutch-occupied areas is extremely serious; the Netherlands has not found a single Indonesian person willing to cooperate with it. "De Waarheid" criticized the government's financial measures taken to continue the war, stating: The government is asking us to make new savings and sacrifices, but the consequences of the war have cost the people three million guilders (Dutch currency), and the new measures will make the people's burden even heavier. The conclusions of all newspapers agree that the only way out for the Netherlands is to immediately restore peace, stop the war policy, and establish friendly relations with the Indonesian people on an equal footing.

Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 24th: Batavia dispatch: Chiang Kai-shek's Consul-General in Batavia, Chiang Tung, without the consent of the Indonesian government, presumptuously established a so-called "Overseas Chinese Security Corps" spy organization in the Dutch-occupied areas of Indonesia on the 15th. According to the Central News Agency, the first batch of this "Security Corps" has gone to a certain place for training, and two weeks later Chiang will be sent to any area that needs his "services." Chiang Chia-tung also broadcast on the 17th, demanding that the Indonesian government agree to establish a similar organization in the Indonesian liberated areas. According to Antara on the 18th, the Indonesian government has sternly rejected this unreasonable demand. Chiang Kai-shek's government, taking advantage of Indonesia's deep national crisis, openly and presumptuously established a "Security Corps" and prepared to expand this spy organization. This will inevitably be exploited by the Netherlands to provoke discord between the Indonesian people and overseas Chinese and to promote mutual animosity and fratricide, resulting in further insecurity for the lives and property of overseas Chinese in Indonesia. Our compatriots must be seriously vigilant.

　　荷军继续违反停战令进攻印尼
  　印尼人民实行焦土抗议
    荷兰人民广泛反对侵略战争
  　蒋党擅在印尼设立特务组织        
    印尼政府严辞反对
    【新华社陕北二十四日电】日惹讯：印尼共和国总理沙利佛丁，于二十二日发表声明，揭露荷军野蛮的破坏停战令，继续发动攻势。自停战令颁布后，荷军在东爪哇侵进三十至九十英里，在西爪哇约九十英里，中爪哇约四十五英里，苏门答腊约二十五英里。荷兰当局并在占领区再度实行恐怖行为。另据美联社二十一日讯，荷高级官员称：荷军将在印尼扩大军事行动。
    【新华社陕北二十三日电】巴达维亚讯：据荷军情报处宣称：在爪哇荷军占领区的怠工与破坏行动正与日俱增中，苏门答腊北部印尼人民亦广泛的实行焦土政策，许多荷兰农场及工厂都被毁坏，其中有世界上最大的巴邻旁茶叶工厂和旦容布得拉之大植物油工厂；爪哇沙拉第之白十字农场亦于八月十九日被怠工者纵火焚毁。苏公及茂物地区之怠工运动正扩大中。
    【新华社陕北二十三日电】海牙讯：据荷兰德格兰杂志载称：代表荷兰各阶层的许多人民团体，都反对比尔政府重新掀起侵略印尼战争的决定。过去支持比尔的工党党员，目前都不拥护现政府。荷工党机关报“巴维尔”报指出：荷兰殖民地分子以“清剿”和所谓“警察措施”血洗印尼地区，并图分裂苏门答腊内部，使共和国陷于孤立之阴谋，是非常危险的。论及荷占领区情况时，“汉德斯比尔”报透露：荷占领区形势最为严重，荷兰没有找到一个愿意和它合作的印尼人民。“德瓦尔海德”报抨击政府为继续作战而采取的财政措施时称：政府要求我们作新的节约与牺牲，然而，战争的后果，却使人民消耗了三百万盾（荷币），新的措施将使人民的负担更为沉重。各报结语中均认为，荷兰惟一的出路，就是立即恢复和平，停止战争政策；并在平等基础上与印尼人民建立友好关系。
    【新华社陕北二十四日电】巴达维亚讯：蒋驻巴城总领事蒋栋未经印尼政府同意，擅自于十五日在印尼荷占领区成立所谓“华侨保安团”之特务组织。据中央社透露：该“保安团”第一批已赴某地受训，二周后蒋被派至需要其“服务”之任何地区。蒋家栋并于十七日广播，要求印尼政府答应于印尼解放区成立同样之组织。据安塔拉十八日电，印尼政府对此一无理要求已严词拒绝。按蒋政府趁印尼国难深重之际，竟公然擅设“保安团”，并准备扩大此一特务组织，必然为荷兰利用以挑拨印尼人民与华侨间之和睦关系，并促成相互仇视与自相残杀之恶果，因而使印尼华侨生命财产更无保障；我侨胞必须严重警惕。
