    Xinhua News Agency, Northwest, 1st. By the end of May, the Guanzhong sub-region of Shaanxi-Gansu-Ningxia had recovered and liberated large areas, freeing 160,000 people suffering under the KMT rule, more than doubling the original population of the sub-region of 130,000. The KMT's "self-defense forces" in Gouyi and Chunhua's Fanglizhen, and Sanyuan's Lingqian Township, who had been coerced by the KMT army, successively revolted under the leadership of battalion commander Ma Zhichao and others, fighting alongside the People's Liberation Army and the people against the enemy. Democratic governments in the newly liberated Gouyi and Sanyuan counties have been formally established, and the establishment of township-level democratic governments in other areas is also largely complete, with the original Baojia system destroyed. Within the Fen Yuan area, except for Xin Zheng, Ma Lan, Chun Yue, Miao Wan, Xin Ning, Xi Po and other places still in enemy hands, all other areas have been recovered. Qiupotou and Dimiao, two towns of Xinzheng County, which were occupied by the KMT army in 1940, have also been liberated. This change in the situation has greatly encouraged the people's fighting spirit in Greater Guanzhong. Now the people in both the old and new areas are working together actively to fight, with the aim of eliminating the invading troops and liberating Greater Guanzhong.

    关中我新收复地区
    民主政权全部建立
    【新华社西北一日电】陕甘宁关中分区迄五月底止，已收复与解放大片地区，解放蒋区苦难深重的人民十六万，较分区原有人口十三万增加一倍以上。受蒋军胁从的枸邑与淳化之方里镇三原之陵前乡等地蒋记“自卫队”，均在大队长马志超等人率领下，相继起义，和解放军民并肩杀敌。新解放区枸邑、三原两县民主政府已正式成立，其他各地乡级民主政府政权亦已大部建立，原有保甲制度，均经摧毁。在分原地区内，除新正、马栏、淳跃、庙湾、新宁、西坡等地尚在敌手外，其他区域均已收复。民国二十九年被蒋军侵占之新正县属湫坡头与底庙两镇亦告光复。这一形势的改变，予大关中人民斗争情绪以极大鼓舞，现新老两区人民正携手合作，积极作战，以期消灭进犯军，解放大关中。
