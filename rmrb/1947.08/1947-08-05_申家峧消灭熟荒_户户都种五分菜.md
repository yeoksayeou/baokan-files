    Shenjiajiao Eliminates Cultivated Wasteland
    Every Household Plants Half a Mu of Vegetables
    [This newspaper's Zuoquan dispatch] During the discussions on preparing for the famine, the masses in various villages came up with three important methods: (1) Utilize all spare time to organize the masses to transport goods in large quantities to earn money and buy rice to overcome the famine. (2) Gather more wild vegetables to replace food grains. (3) Plant more autumn vegetables to substitute for grain; planting one more mu saves one life. After ideological education in various villages, the masses immediately took action. Yang Gong, Guo Xiquan, and three others were providing lodging and boarding for the masses in the Tumenshan mountains. They also used their time to plant autumn vegetables. Yao Gengshan said, "We only just turned over to become masters of our own destiny, and now we've encountered this year's difficult situation. We must listen to the government and plant more buckwheat to make up for the shortfall." He planted twelve mu of buckwheat. Shenjiajiao Village originally planned to plant half a mu of autumn vegetables per household. After being hit by hail on the 13th, the entire village replanted within two days. They also put forward the slogan "Plant a few more mu of vegetables, save a few more lives." Within three days, the entire village of sixty-one households organized the masses to eliminate sixty-one mu of cultivated wasteland and planted buckwheat and vegetables. Labor hero Guan Yinzhen of Shibao led the entire village to plant one mu of autumn vegetables per household. The eleven villages of the Aiyukou and Tongtan joint defense area planted a total of 652 mu of autumn vegetables within three days. Tongtan had the greatest success in transportation. Political Director Liu Fushan contracted with the masses to transport 50,000 jin of coal, earning 400,000 yuan at eight yuan per jin. At the current town's rice price of 2,200 yuan per dou, this could buy eighteen shi and two dou of millet. Labor hero Jia Fukui organized full laborers to transport goods in large quantities, while semi-laborers and auxiliary laborers dug wild vegetables. In his first brigade, they dug more than 2,000 jin of wild vegetables in one and a half days. The entire village has eight brigades, and they dug a total of more than 12,000 jin of vegetables. Under his influence, the masses in ten villages are gathering wild vegetables, making plans for conservation and famine preparation, and launching an emulation drive to perform meritorious service.

    [This newspaper's Pingshun dispatch] The Second District's drought prevention, famine preparation, and conservation efforts began on June 15th with a mobilization meeting of key village cadres convened by the district. All villages in the district universally took action on June 20th. By July 20th, within one month, the following achievements had been made: In the entire district's twenty-seven administrative villages, with a total of 4,052 households and 16,908 people, people voluntarily conserved resources and lowered their living standards, saving a total of 101 shi and 4.4 dou of grain in one month, and gathering a total of 123,384 jin of wild vegetables. A concentrated effort to replant and rush-plant beans, buckwheat, barley, millet, vegetables, etc., covered more than 4,000 mu. In addition, more than 1,300 mu of barren slopes that were not previously cultivated have now been opened up for planting vegetables. Combined with sideline occupations, a total of more than 1,663,000 yuan has been earned, buying back more than 6,000 jin of millet and more than 3,000 jin of corn. After inspection and summary, each village selected production and famine preparation models, and this work will be consistently adhered to. (Shuang Hong, Jian Xian)
