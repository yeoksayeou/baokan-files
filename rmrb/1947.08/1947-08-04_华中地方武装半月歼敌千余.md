Xinhua News Agency, Central China, 2nd: In the first half of July, local armed forces in the Central Jiangsu and Northern Jiangsu regions launched general offensives. In Central Jiangsu, they shattered the "mopping-up" operation by four Kuomintang army regiments against the Dongtai area. From Qi(dong) Hai(men) in the east to Yang(zhou) Tai(zhou) in the west, they captured important towns such as Xilai, Sanyu Qian, Xin Street, and Dingxi. The Taixian county regiment eliminated one and a half companies of the Chiang Kai-shek's security team with one casualty each. The Jiangdu and Gaoyou local armed forces achieved four victories in five days with a zero-to-one-hundred casualty ratio. Local armed forces in various counties in Northern Jiangsu launched attacks on Kuomintang-occupied transportation lines. Twenty militiamen from a certain district in Huai'an once captured He Xia, an important town on the outskirts of Huai'an city, capturing twenty defending enemies, creating a model case of militiamen capturing towns in Northern Jiangsu. They also forced the retreat of eighteen Kuomintang and puppet strongholds, including Cheqiao (east suburb of Huai'an), resulting in a total of 1,350 Kuomintang, puppet, and security team members (including battalion commanders and below) killed, wounded, or captured, and the seizure of twenty-two light and heavy machine guns and five hundred and twenty-five rifles and pistols in half a month.

Xinhua News Agency, Shandong, 2nd: The local backbone armed forces of the Third Sub-district of Southern Shandong have significantly improved their combat effectiveness. From December last year to May this year, they eliminated 3,571 enemies. The enemy-to-friendly casualty ratio increased from nine to one (in January) to sixty-six to one (in May). Furthermore, on the morning of July 14th, Liu Gu's regiment, a backbone local armed force of the Binhai Sub-district, eliminated one platoon each of the Kuomintang 83rd Division and Chiang Kai-shek's security team in a half-hour battle north of Dabu on the Lin(yi) Tan(cheng) Highway, capturing thirty-one enemy personnel (including platoon leaders and below) and killing or wounding fifteen. They also destroyed four enemy pillboxes along the highway.
