Diary of Following the Army South
Zhang Bo

Fourth Day

    When we set off, everyone in the village came out to see us off. The Women's Federation and the Children's Corps lined up, beating gongs and drums, shouting slogans that resounded through the clouds. The soldiers responded to the villagers with enthusiastic slogans:

    -- We will work hard to kill the enemy in the great counter-offensive and avenge the villagers!
    -- Protect the fruits of victory and eliminate Chiang Kai-shek!

    Load after load of boiled water was brought over. After drinking the farewell water, the soldiers waved goodbye, and the villagers beat gongs and drums to see us off in formation. Even two *li* away from the village, the villagers were still reluctant to leave, and the soldiers frequently turned back.

    -- Villagers! Please go back! We will repay you with practical actions!

    Three or four *li* away from the village, we could still faintly hear the villagers' heroic slogans: Chiang bandit! Just watch! This is the power of the people!

    New recruit Zhao Shuize was thinking silently all the way:

    "Luckily, I joined the army, otherwise, if Chiang Kai-shek attacked my home, the fruits I had been given, my land, my cattle, and my chickens would all be finished. If Chiang Kai-shek is not defeated, my fruits will never be guaranteed! Right! Fight to the end!

    Today we traveled a short distance, only forty *li*.

Fifth Day

    Today's news is that the soldiers are washing clothes, or lying in the shade of trees, talking, laughing, drinking water, and sleeping...

    Only fifty *li* left to the river. Chiang bandit's planes appear in the azure sky from time to time, sometimes flying very low in a rampant manner. The villagers' chickens are startled and run around the yard, squawking. Our landlord, the old lady, is afraid that the plane will hear her chicken's cries, so she points at the chicken angrily but quietly and scolds:

    "If you keep crying, I'll kill you!"

    But she herself doesn't dare to leave the house, afraid that she herself will be seen by the plane.

    Little Tang is joking with the old villager again.

    "Old lady! Look! It's all because your chicken is crying that the plane heard it and keeps flying here, not leaving!"

    The old lady is even more dissatisfied with her chicken.

    Little Tang laughed for a while, and we slept well that night.

Sixth Day

    Tonight we are close to the riverbank, preparing to cross the river tomorrow.

    We set off before dusk. The soldiers' straw hats are camouflaged with branches, willow twigs, and green grass. Chiang's planes only lingered for a while on the distant riverbank and did not notice us. We continued to advance towards the Yellow River.

    We camped at night. The moonlight is very good, the sky is clear for thousands of miles, and the stars are shining. Each squad is holding meetings under the shadows of the trees. Some soldiers have never crossed the Yellow River before and are guessing about their imagined greatness of the Yellow River.

    Everyone's common expectation is to hope that tomorrow will come quickly, to cross the river, kill the enemy, and complete the initial stage of the great counter-offensive. After the meeting, everyone is so excited that they can't sleep...

Seventh Day

    Early morning. The company commander announced that the advance troops of General Liu Bocheng's People's Liberation Army had bravely crossed the Yellow River last night and completely breached the natural barrier of 360 *li* of river defense held by Chiang bandit in three hours. The soldiers shouted excitedly. The second platoon deputy's harmonica rang again, and unusually, he moved his lips back and forth in several holes in one breath. This is his expression of extreme excitement and joy.

    We were ordered to reach the riverbank before 8:00 p.m. Therefore, we set off very early, at 5:30 p.m. The soldiers re-adjusted their air defense camouflage. The big black pot in the cooking class was covered with a layer of yellow mud. Halfway there, Chiang's plane came. Everyone squatted on the ground, neatly like a row of lush small trees, and the big black pot covered with yellow mud looked like a small tomb beside the forest.

    At 7:30, we arrived at the ferry. There were too many troops, and we were ordered to cross the river last. The cunning and hateful Chiang's planes bombed and strafed along the river in shifts, two or three at a time, all night long. The soldiers were quite "satisfied" with Chiang's planes because our army did not suffer a single casualty all night.

    Because we were the last to cross the river, everyone lay on the bank in the woods to rest, watching the plane strafe, the strip of fire emitted from the tail of the bullets, like shooting stars.

    The moon has already tilted to the west and will soon set. It looks like it won't be our turn to cross the river tonight.

Eighth Day

    Last night, all the troops crossed the Yellow River, leaving only our unit, but we need to go to another ferry. According to the order, our fraternal units should cross the river at this ferry tonight.

    The two ferries are far apart. In order to get there in time, we set off early in the morning. The plane circled over our heads twice, but did not bomb or strafe, and we did not hide.

    At night, the sky was full of dark clouds, with wind and rain. Chiang's plane did not come. The area along the riverbank was very quiet. The soldiers sat in rows on the sandy beach, no one speaking, no one smoking. The second platoon deputy's harmonica was next to his lips, but he didn't play it. Everyone was waiting patiently for the boat. The river was flowing rapidly, but it was not very wide, only about 500 meters.

    Finally, it was our turn to cross the river. One followed the other, one squad followed the other, and walked into the cabin. Because we are the follow-up troops, we don't need much combat preparation. The boatman lightly touched the riverbank with the punt pole, and like an arrow, the boat sailed towards the south bank along the current. In a few minutes, we approached the south bank. About 100 meters from the south bank, the river was very shallow, and the boat could not get close. We needed to get off the boat and wade ashore. Everyone walked through the two-foot-deep shoal and smoothly reached the south bank.

    On the shore, the soldiers' moods were tense, excited, and happy. Everyone sat on the shore wiping their guns and tidying up their weapons. Thousands of brave soldiers, tens of thousands of gun muzzles, charged straight towards the heart of Chiang bandit.

    Soon, everyone will hear the news of victory.

    随军南下日记
    张勃
    第四日
    出发的时候，全村的人都送出来了，妇救会、儿童团排着队，打着锣鼓，呼着声振云霄，战士们也以热烈的口号来回答老乡：
    ——我们要在大反攻中努力杀敌，替老乡们报仇。
    ——保护胜利果实，消灭蒋介石。
    开水一担紧跟着一担送来了，喝完了临别的开水，战士们举手道别，老乡们打着锣鼓整队相送。离开村子，已经二里路了，老乡们还是恋恋不舍，战士们也在回头频频。
    ——老乡们！请回罢！我们要以实际行动来报答你们。
    离村子已经三、四里路了，还隐隐约约的可以听见老乡们壮烈的口号声：蒋贼！看吧！这就是人民的力量。
    新战士赵水则，一路上都在默默的想：
    “幸亏我参了军，要不然老蒋打到我家了，我分的果实，我的地，我的牛，我的鸡，也都完蛋了。打不垮蒋介石，我的果实，永远没有保障的，对！干倒底！
    今天路走的很近，只有四十里。
    第五日
    今天消息，战士们都在洗衣服，或躺在树荫下，谈笑、喝水、睡觉……
    离河只剩下五十里路了，蒋贼的飞机，不时在蔚蓝的天空出现，有时猖獗的飞得很低；老乡的鸡，惊得满院乱跑乱叫，我们房东老太婆怕他的鸡叫被飞机听见了，怒气冲冲但却小声的指着鸡骂：
    “再叫，杀了你！”
    但是他自己也不敢走出屋子，怕她自己也被飞机看见了。
    小汤又和老乡开起玩笑来了。
    “老乡！你看！都是你的鸡叫，飞机听见了，老在这里飞，不走！”
    老太婆对于他的鸡更不满意了。
    小汤笑了一阵，我们晚上睡了一个好觉。
    第六日
    今晚靠近了河岸，准备明天渡河。
    黄昏以前就出发了，战士们的草帽上，都用树枝柳条和青草伪装起来，蒋机只在远远的河畔，徘徊了一阵，并没有发觉我们，我们依旧向黄河挺进。
    入夜，宿营，月光很好，万里无云，群星闪耀。各班都在树影下开会，有些战士没有过过黄河，都在纷纷猜想他们想象中黄河的伟大。
    大家共同的期待，就是盼望明天快些到来，渡河、杀敌，完成大反攻的初步。开完了会，大家兴奋得睡不着觉。………
    第七日
    清晨。连长宣布刘伯承将军所部人民解放军先头部队，已于昨夜英勇渡过了黄河，三小时内完全突破了蒋贼持为屏障的天险——三百六十里的河防。战士们都兴奋的高呼，二排副的口琴又响起来了，居然破例，一连气把嘴唇在几个孔里来回移动，这是他兴奋愉快到了极点的表现。
    命令我们晚上八点钟以前赶到河边。因此，出发很早，下午五点半就出发了，战士们重新整理了一下自己防空的伪装，炊事班里的大黑锅底上涂满了一层黄泥，半路，蒋机来了，大家都蹲在地上，很整齐的象一排枝叶茂盛的小树，那口涂满黄泥的大黑锅，则象路旁树林边的小坟墓呵。
    七点半钟，我们就到达了渡口，部队太多，命令是我们最后渡河，狡猾可恶的蒋机，三架两架轮番在沿河一带轰炸，扫射，一夜未停。对于蒋机，战士们都认为相当“满意”，因为一夜功夫我军并没有伤亡一人。
    因为我们是最后渡河，大家都躺在堤旁树林里休息，看飞机扫射，弹尾发出的条形火光，象流星一样。
    月已西斜，很快的就要下沉了，看样子今夜轮不到我们渡河了。
    第八日
    昨夜部队都渡过黄河了，只剩下我们一个单位，但是我们须要到另外一个渡口去，照命令规定，这个渡口，今夜该友邻部队渡河了。
    两个渡口相距很远，为了及时赶到，我们一清早就出发了，飞机在头上盘旋了两次，但没有轰炸，也没有扫射，我们也没有隐避。
    入夜，乌云满天，风雨交加，蒋机没有来。河岸一带很静。战士们一排一排坐在河滩沙地上，没有一个人说话，没有一个人吸烟，二排副的口琴放在嘴唇旁边，也不吹了，大家都在安心等船。河水流的湍急，但并不很宽，只五百米达左右。
    终于轮到我们渡河了，一个紧跟一个，一班紧跟一班，走进了船舱，因为我们是后续部队，所以并不需要怎样的准备战斗。船篙轻轻的一点河岸，顺着流水，箭似的向南岸驶去，几分钟就接近了南岸，距南岸约百米达，河水很浅，船不能驶近，需要下船涉水上岸，大家走过了两尺深的水滩，顺利的到达了南岸。
    上了岸，战士们的心情是紧张的、兴奋的、愉快的，大家坐在岸边擦枪、整理武装，千万个英勇的战士，千万只枪口，直向蒋贼的心脏冲过去。
    不久，大家将要听到胜利的消息了。
