　　Villages Compete and Everyone Strives to be First
  　The Mutual Aid Movement at the Berlin Base Point
    Er Dong
    The weeding movement at the Berlin base point in the 7th district of Wu'an (including ten large villages and 10,000 people) has truly formed a mass competition exceeding any previous year. The 18 mutual aid groups in Upper Berlin, with 122 laborers, planned to weed 930 mu of corn in five days, but completed it in four days, saving 122 workdays. After summarizing these four days and praising a group of models who started early and weeded quickly and well, the mutual aid groups expanded to 185 people and set a new short-term plan: to weed more than 10 qing of millet seedlings in ten days (which would take 15 days at the individual labor rate). They completed it in eight and a half days, saving more than 270 workdays. In the past, the four villages in Berlin would have to use at least 1,500 short-term laborers; this year, only East Berlin used about ten, and the others used none. In addition, the situations in the villages of Xinghua, Jianshan, Fenling, and Longwu were roughly the same; they all completed ten-day plans in eight or nine days, exceeding the old speed by about half. Members of the Former Berlin mutual aid group collectively contracted the land of households without labor and worked for the public, earning 220,000 yuan. The formerly most backward Gulinzi group in Longwu village also saved workdays to contract land for two mornings, earning 10,000 yuan. Guo Xingyuan, an 18-year-old young man in East Berlin who is small, was planting 14 mu of land. His grandmother was worried that he would not be able to weed it all, but after weeding in the mutual aid group, he calculated that he did not owe a single workday and even opened a mu of garden. His grandmother happily praised everywhere, "The mutual aid group is really good!" The Gu Chou group in Longwu, with about ten households, used short-term laborers every year in the past. This year, everyone earned wages (in addition to planting their own land, they also contracted other people's land). Gu Chou happily shouted, "Mutual aid is good!" "So much good to say."
    Recent statistics from the 7th district show that male laborers participating in mutual aid account for 84 percent of all male laborers in the district (female laborers mainly weave), and the Berlin base point has almost reached 90 percent. Those remaining outside the group are a few landlords, orphans, widows, those who do not want to change, and those who have been running outside for long-term picking and chopping (the latter's land is also cultivated by the group, which pays the wages itself). Every morning, in each village, people cook before the roosters crow, and they blow the whistle and go to the fields as soon as it is light. They do not gather, but they all arrive very punctually. After going to the fields, they smoke a few bags of tobacco and start weeding without waiting for anyone (waiting for people to go to the fields was one of the reasons for the collapse of mutual aid in the past). Occasionally, one or two people arrive late, and they try to catch up desperately; otherwise, they will be deducted points, penalized with rice, and fall behind. The rest time in the morning and afternoon is also extremely short. At noon, many groups eat in the fields in order to finish a piece of land and not delay the afternoon's full work. Eating in the fields has "extra points," which are distributed by the eaters. For this reason, they often do not take a nap. Guo Xingzheng, a 60-year-old man in East Berlin, when asked by others why he was not in the mutual aid group, said, "I still want to live a few more days!" He was afraid of getting up early, eating at noon, walking several miles, and walking so fast that it would "torment this old life." After others told him that "doing a few points counts, it's very active," he also participated. Because this can guarantee that the land will not be left uncultivated.
    Except for Liujiahe and Dongshan villages, which did not do well because the main cadres were not active (but also produced typical groups), the enthusiasm and organizational scale of the eight villages were about the same, with only differences in the working foundation and consolidation degree. According to district cadres, it is now difficult to select models: the masses in each village are almost equally active. Except for differences in technical level, it is only possible to select those who are particularly energetic and can find significant characteristics and outstanding achievements to commend. For example, the Guo Sanfu group in Upper Berlin sometimes gets up and goes to the fields before dawn and weeds a lot of land first (other villages also have many such examples); Cao Fengming in Longwu almost never rests at noon, either eating in the fields or doing other work, and beats the gong to call people as soon as it is time to start work. Li Du, a labor hero in East Berlin, and two members of a group weeded seven mu of corn in one day (ordinary people can weed at most about one mu). However, due to the extremely high enthusiasm for competition, the masses in each village compared with each other and still compared many model figures. According to the statistics after the first weeding, each village selected no less than 30 to 50 models, some of whom had improved their skills, some of whom had particularly high speed, and some of whom were good at helping others, getting up early, eating in the fields, and saving money.
    So what are the reasons for doing so well? First, because the cadres at the base point have been paying close attention to production from beginning to end. That is, even when the anti-feudal movement in the upper half of the district (Guan Taochuan) was in full swing in July, the base point only put the anti-feudal movement in a subordinate position, doing it when there was time and not doing it when there was no time. The leadership of production was not relaxed at all. Second, at the beginning of June, they carefully studied the lessons of the collapse of many groups in the past and came up with many new methods for timely prevention. For example, last year, some cadres wanted special treatment in the group, going late and returning early, earning full workdays, and having to weed for themselves first. The leadership style was not democratic, and the distribution of work was not discussed with the masses. They only cared about the enthusiasm and the number of people and did not care how many people were needed for a piece of land each day. This year, it is stipulated that cadres and the masses are completely the same, recording points according to the work, and ordering the order according to the size of the seedlings and the dryness and wetness of the land. Everyone evaluates points, orders points, plans tomorrow's work, and allocates manpower. Last year, some sharp people took advantage of the group and defaulted on wages. This year, they were squeezed out first, and they were allowed to reflect on themselves and set good discipline conditions before coming in again; work points were evaluated and work tickets were issued every day, accounts were settled every five days, and accounts were cleared every ten days. Last year, there were often disputes about weeding first and weeding later. This year, the groups were divided into smaller groups in time, and they walked three families of land a day, so no one suffered. Last year, the wage rate fluctuated from time to time. Once the wage increase was slow, the remaining labor force flowed out. This year, Yangyi Town notified the villages of wage changes at any time, and the villages discussed it themselves. Wages were re-set when the accounts were settled every five days, and wages were paid at the average wage within five days. The difference was small, so it was consolidated. Last year, some feudal saboteurs provoked discord in the group. This year, they were squeezed out from the beginning when they voluntarily joined. Last year, some cadres and party members did not participate in mutual aid. This year, they all became members and actively played a driving role. Third, the backbone and leadership components of this year's mutual aid movement are mostly emancipated poor and hired peasants. Many of them were still working as short-term laborers for others last year, and this year they turned the land into their own for the first time. "For the first time in my life, I have cultivated good land. I see it as a treasure. When I get to the field, I don't want to come back. I just want to cultivate it better" (Guo Zhanlu, an emancipated hero in Upper Berlin). Statistics from 13 typical groups in ten villages show that nine group leaders were emancipated heroes last winter who had fought resolutely. The heroes and models selected in the weeding are mostly emancipated poor peasants. Fourth, the widespread application of new leadership methods: the most basic of which is large-scale, solemn commendation and celebration of achievements, heroes parading with red ribbons and flowers, and the masses warmly celebrating their achievements, so that everyone feels that the glorious title of hero is not as mysterious and difficult to obtain as it was in 1943, but is very close to themselves and can be obtained with effort. The standard is also very specific and practical, and the names and facts of many people are transmitted to everyone's ears from the radio tube every day: one name is broadcast five times for a small achievement, and fifteen times is a major achievement, which is not difficult to strive for. Secondly, a short-term plan for a few days, the goal is very clear. In addition, the mobilization of the whole party before and after July 1st also has a considerable relationship. The best groups in Upper Berlin have party members playing a driving role, and the number of parties has also increased several times. The Guo Sanfu group, a member of the Armed Forces Committee and a member of the Farmers' Association Standing Committee, are all members. In addition to exemplarily implementing the call, they can also help solve difficulties in a timely manner. For example, one day, because the land of group member Guo Chounan was low and wet, weeding was useless, so it was decided to give the San Ruyi family first. Chounan was unhappy and lied to Ruyi's family, saying, "The group leader told me to give it to me first!" San Ruyi was unhappy and went to his own land alone. In the evening, everyone immediately resolved the situation. Chounan reviewed that he was wrong to lie and did not blame Ruyi. Ruyi reviewed that he was not good at acting alone and did not blame Chounan. The next day, they were as united and friendly as before. The collapse of some groups in the past was often due to a little thing, so this kind of timely resolution is also very important.

　　村村竞赛人人争先
  　柏林基点的互助运动
    而东
    武安七区柏林基点（包括十个大村一万人口）的锄苗运动，真正形成了超过已往任何一年的群众性竞赛。上柏林十八个互助组，一百二十二个劳力，计划五天锄完九百三十亩玉茭，结果四天就完了，省工一百二十二个。总结了这四天，表扬了一批起早、锄快锄好的模范之后，互助组扩展到一百八十五人，订出下一短期计划：十天锄完十顷多小谷苗（按个体劳动速度须十五天），结果八天半又完了，省工二百七十多个。柏林四个村往年至少要用一千五百短工，今年只东柏林用了十来个，其余一个没用。此外，杏花、尖山、坟岭、龙务四村，情形也大体差不多，都是十天计划八、九天就完了，比旧日速度超过半倍左右。前柏林互助组员集体包种无劳力户土地，给公家做活，赚廿二万元。以前最落后的龙务村古林子组，十个人也省出工来包种地两清早，赚一万元。东柏林有一个长的很小的十八岁青年郭兴元，种着十四亩地，他奶奶光发愁锄不过来，而他在互助组里锄完后计算，竟没有欠一个工，还开了一亩园。他奶奶高兴的到处夸奖“互助组实在是好”。龙务古臭的组十来户，以前年年用短工，今年人人赚工资（除种自己地还包种别人地）。喜得古臭的拉开嗓子直叫“互助好”！“说不完的好”。
    七区最近统计，参加互助的男劳力占全区男劳力百分之八十四（女劳力主要纺织），而柏林基点差不多都达到了百分之九十。留在组外的是少数封、孤寡、不想转变的尖头与长期跑外拾砍者（后者的土地也由组里代种、自掏工资）。每天清早，各村都是鸡不叫就打钟做饭，天一亮就吹哨上地，并不集合，但都到得很齐。上地后吸几袋烟就开锄，也不等人（上地等人曾是过去互助的垮台原因之一）。偶而有一二人到晚了，便拚命追赶，否则是扣分贴米又落后，上下午晌间休息，时间也极短。午间则有许多组为赶完一块地而搭晌，使不耽误下午整工。搭晌有“外加点”分，由搭者分得，他们为此经常不睡午觉。东柏林六十岁老汉郭兴政在别人问他为何不在互助组时，他说：“我还想活几天哩！”他怕起早搭午、一走好几里、又走得飞快，“折磨了这个老命。”后经别人告诉他“能做几分算几分，很活便”，他也参加了。因为这可以保证荒不了地。
    除刘家河、东山二村因主要干部不积极、没有搞好（但也产生了典型组）以外，八个村的热烈程度与组织规模差不多是一样的，仅有工作基础与巩固程度之不同。据区干部谈，现在选模范产生新的困难：各村群众几乎都一样积极。除技术高低有差别外，仅能选择精力特别强，能找出显著特点与突出成绩的来表扬。比如：上柏林的郭三富组，有时天不明就起来下地，先锄了不少地（其他村也有不少这种例子）；龙务的曹凤明，几乎每午不歇，或者搭晌，或者做别的活，一到起晌时间便打锣叫人。东柏林劳动英雄李杜与一组员二人一天锄玉茭七亩（普通至多能锄一亩左右）。但是，由于竞赛热情极高，各村群众比来比去，还是比出了许多模范人物。据头遍锄完后统计，各村都选了三十至五十不等的模范，其中有的是技术提高了，有的是速度特别高，有的是帮助别人好、起早、搭晌、省吃俭用好。
    所以搞得这样好的原因何在呢？第一，由于该基点的干部自始至终把生产抓得很紧。即在上半区（管陶川）七月份的挤封建运动搞得翻天覆地之时，该基点也只把挤封建放在服从地位，有空就挤挤，没空就不挤。对生产的领导丝毫未放松。第二，六月初就细密研究了去年以前许多组垮台的教训，研究出许多新办法，进行了及时的预防。比如：去年有些干部在组里要特殊，晚去早回顶全工，还得先给自己锄，领导作风不民主，订分拨工不与群众商量，光顾形式热烈、人多，不管一块地一天需要几个人恰好；今年规定干部群众完全一样按活记分，依照苗大小地干湿来订先后，大家评分订分、计划明天活、人力分配。去年有尖头在组内沾光，拖欠工资，今年先把他们挤出去，让他们反省好、订好纪律条件再进来；天天评工拨工票，五天一算帐，十天一清帐。去年先锄后锄常起争执，今年把组及时划小，一天走三家地，谁也不吃亏。去年工价时常波动，一时工资提慢了，剩余劳力即外流；今年由阳邑镇随时将工价变动通知各村，各村自己讨论，五天结帐时另订工资，五天内按平均工资偿付，出入很小，便巩固了。去年有些封建破坏分子在组内挑拨离间；今年一开始自愿结合时就把他们挤了出去。去年有些干部与党员不参加互助；今年一律当了组员，积极起推动作用。第三、今年互助运动的骨干与领导成份多是翻身贫雇农。其中有许多在去年还给人家打短工，今年才把地变成自己的，“平生第一次种好地，看见就跟宝贝一样，到了地里不想回来，光想把他种得再好一点”（上柏林翻身英雄郭占禄语）。十个村十三个典型组统计，有九个组长是去冬的翻身英雄，坚决斗争过来的。锄苗中选出的英雄、模范，绝大部分是翻身贫农。第四、新的领导方法的普遍应用：其中最基本的是大规模的、郑重的表模贺功，英雄们披红带花大游行，群众热烈贺功，使每个人都觉得光荣的英雄称号并不象四三年那样神秘难得，而是和自己离得十分近，只要努力就能得到，其标准也非常具体切实，每天都有好些人的名字与事实从广播筒传到各人耳朵：一个名字广播五次一小功，十五次就是一大功，并不难争取。其次，几天一个短期计划，奋斗目标很明确。此外七一前后全党的动员关系也颇不小。上柏林几个最好的组，都有党员起推动作用，党的数量也已扩大数倍。郭三富组，一个武委会主任、一个农会常委，都是当组员，除模范的执行号召外，并能及时帮助排解困难。比如有一天，因为组员郭臭旦的地又低又湿，锄了不顶事，决定先给三如意家去锄，臭旦不高兴，即到如意家撒谎说：“组长叫先给俺锄哩！”三如意不高兴，便独自上自己地去了。晚间大家马上排解，臭旦检讨了自己撒谎不对，不怨如意，如意检讨了自己单独行动不好，不怨臭旦，第二日即团结友好如初，过去有些组的垮台，往往由于一点小事，所以这种随时排解也是很重要的。
