    Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 3rd. The Chiang family's small court's "State Council," under the "personal supervision" of the traitor Chiang Kai-shek, formally passed a resolution on the 1st to immediately resume trade with Japan and dispatch a business delegation to Japan. Chiang's Central News Agency, in an attempt to cover up this shameful act, issued a telegram of more than a thousand words, repeatedly trying to argue how the Chiang government was handling this matter with "extreme caution" and how "it is impossible for Japanese goods to be dumped into our country." But the result was not only useless sophistry but also revealed the ugly account of the Chiang government's unauthorized export of salt and coal to Japan last year, despite the people's opposition, to supply Japan as industrial raw materials. The Chiang government's acceptance this time of the U.S. imperialist proposal to immediately resume trade with Japan is based on the "Sino-Japanese Trade Plan" for 1947 drafted by the Japanese government last month. This plan fully exposes the sinister intentions of U.S. imperialism to support the resurgence of Japanese economic aggression, and the Japanese reactionary warlords' "industrial Japan" and "raw material China." The implementation of this plan will be a new fatal blow to China's industry and commerce, which have suffered greatly from U.S. imperialist economic aggression. Since MacArthur Headquarters proposed to the Chiang government to immediately resume trade with Japan, industrial and commercial groups and business leaders in the Chiang-controlled areas have resolutely opposed it. The China Industrial Cooperation Association even organized a petitioning delegation to go to Nanjing on the 24th of last month to petition. Even the Chiang family's Political Participation Council, the National Economic Commission, and other institutions, in order to ease the anger of the people across the country, once advocated "temporarily following the public opinion and postponing the opening up." Some members of the Chiang family's Control Yuan also called this measure "endangering the foundation of the nation." However, Chiang Kai-shek, the head of the traitorous clique, in order to curry favor with his American master Wedemeyer, disregarded the accusations of the whole country and "personally presided over" the passage of this traitorous, pro-American, and pro-Japanese resolution.

    卖国媚美危及国本
    蒋亲主持通过恢复对日贸易
    【新华社陕北三日电】蒋家小朝廷“国务会议”，在卖国贼将介石“亲临主持”下，已于一日正式通过了立即恢复对日贸易，派遣商务代表团赴日的决议案。蒋家中央社为了力图掩饰这一可耻的勾当，发出了长达千余字的电文，反复狡辩蒋政府处理这件事情如何“十分慎重”，“日货倾销我国之事”如何“不可能”，但结果是非但狡辩无用，反把去年蒋政府不顾人民反对，擅自将盐、煤输日供日本作工业原料的丑帐也倒出来了。蒋政府这次接受美国帝国主义所提出的立即恢复对日贸易的意旨，是根据日政府上月所拟定之一九四七年“中日贸易计划”的。这计划充分暴露美帝国主义扶植日本经济侵略再起，及日本反动军阀“工业日本”“原料中国”的阴险企图。此计划的实施，对饱受美帝国主义经济侵略的中国工商业，将是一新的致命打击。自麦克阿瑟总部向蒋政府提出立即恢复对日贸易后，蒋管区各工商业团体及商业界领袖即纷纷坚决反对，中国工协并曾组织请愿团于上月二十四日赴宁请愿，甚至蒋家参政会，全国经济委员会等机构，为了缓和全国人民的愤怒，亦曾一度主张“暂从众议，从缓开放”；蒋家监察院的一些委员亦称此一措施为“危及国本”。但蒋介石卖国头子为着向美国主人魏德迈献媚，遂不顾举国的责难，“亲临主持”通过此一卖国媚美亲日的决议案。
