　　Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 21st: Zhengzhou Dispatch: Since the Chiang government airlifted over 3,000 middle school students from Anyang to Xinxiang at the end of June, they have been using sweet words to induce them to join the army or participate in the Chiang army's special agent organization, the "Pacification Area Work Team." Those who refused were cut off from food and lodging. Only then did they realize they had been deceived. A few sought refuge with relatives and friends, but the majority wandered around. Currently, there are over 1,900 stranded in Zhengzhou. They generally share a small tin bucket among three to five people, and cook two meals of thin porridge daily with scavenged firewood to barely survive. Students and teachers from schools such as Chu Wang Middle School work as laborers at the airport, crushing stones. They complain bitterly and deeply regret falling for Chiang Kai-shek's scam.

　　安阳学生上了大当
  　三千余人被蒋党诱迫当炮灰
    【新华社陕北廿一日电】郑州讯：蒋政府自六月底由安阳空运三千余中学生抵新乡后，即甜言蜜语诱迫彼等当兵或参加蒋军特务组织“绥靖区工作队”，如不就范即断绝供给食宿，至此彼等始知被骗，少数投奔亲友，多数到处流浪，目前流落郑州的就有一千九百余人。他们普遍的是三五个人共一个小洋铁桶，用拾来柴草就地每天煮两顿稀饭苟延残喘。楚旺中学等校员生则在飞机场充当敲石块的小工，叫苦不堪，深悔上了蒋介石的当。
