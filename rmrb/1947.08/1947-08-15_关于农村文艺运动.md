　　On Rural Literary and Artistic Movement
    Huang Mei
    At the Yan'an Forum on Literature and Art, after hearing Comrade Wang Yaping's report on the work of the Folk Art Department of the Ji-Lu-Yu (Hebei-Shandong-Henan) Literary Association in transforming folk artists and folk art, everyone became enthusiastically concerned and discussed the rural literary and artistic activities in the border areas. Everyone unanimously agreed that the rural literary and artistic movement in the border areas has long been vigorously developing (although stronger in some areas and weaker in others), but generally speaking, literary and artistic workers have probably not yet given it enough importance.
    I personally think that the following issues should also be raised for further study and discussion with literary and artistic comrades in various regions:
    1. Should the development of the literary and artistic movement in the border areas first pay attention to the cultivation and promotion of rural literary and artistic activities as one of the basic links in the new literary and artistic movement? Today's rural literary and artistic movement in the border areas is developing on the basis of the liberation of the broad masses. In areas where the emancipation movement is well-developed, rural artistic activities are very active and widespread; conversely, they appear depressed. This is a movement of "the masses are liberated, they sing and enjoy themselves," a spontaneous and urgent demand of the masses after liberation. Only this movement can truly and directly provide "timely help" to the people, spreading to such a vast and dispersed rural environment. At the same time, many facts have proven that once the masses step onto the artistic stage as masters, they immediately demonstrate vigorous, powerful, and richly creative artistic talents! They are fully capable and good at mastering artistic weapons, thereby opening up and expanding a new world of literary and artistic routes! Only by relying on such mass strength can we resist old operas, promote the transformation of folk artists, abolish the constraints and influences of superstition and feudal ideology, and clear obstacles for the new literary and artistic movement, occupying an unprecedentedly vast new front. Therefore, literary and artistic workers must clarify their thinking, recognize the importance of this issue, and immediately pay close attention; care about the development of this movement, conduct regular investigations and research, understand the situation, discover typical examples, cultivate typical examples, and summarize experiences to promote and develop this movement.
    In the past, some cultural and educational departments and literary and artistic workers in various regions have played a significant role in inspiring, organizing, and leading the rural literary and artistic movement, accumulating and creating many valuable experiences. Unfortunately, in some work, the connection and cooperation between local literary federations and literary and artistic workers and cultural and educational departments were insufficient, and literary and artistic workers did not regard this work as their own responsibility. Sometimes cultural and educational departments are not familiar enough with the work and find it difficult to provide specific assistance to improve its technical aspects; coupled with insufficient regular leadership, and lack of experience summarization and exchange, the movement cannot be better promoted. In the future, literary and artistic workers should actively cooperate with cultural and educational departments to quickly summarize this work, in order to make up for the uneven development in various regions.
    2. I feel that in order to carry out the rural literary and artistic movement, uniting and transforming folk artists and old artists is also an important key. The experience of various regions has proved that folk artists and old artists have skilled techniques, are generally familiar with the lives of the masses, and are mostly from poor backgrounds. Therefore, this transformation, making them change to serve the masses, is entirely possible and has already achieved great results. The work of the Folk Art Department of the Ji-Lu-Yu Literary Association is a good example. For example, many famous rural troupes in Taihang were transformed from old opera troupes. Furthermore, the blind propaganda team in Wu'xiang and Zuoquan, and the Liu Jintang recitation team in Yangcheng, etc., are all transformed folk artists. There is a lot of experience in this area, but there is a lack of systematic understanding and summarization.
    3. Today, drama is still the most active, universal, and successful in the rural literary and artistic movement in the border areas. Especially after a year of land reform movement, it has developed by leaps and bounds, both in quantity and quality. However, according to the information we have, the summary of the rural theater troupes at the Handan Border Region Cultural Workers Conference last year is still correct and applicable today. Any rural theater troupe established according to this policy will have development. First, it is determined to be a mass amateur activity, not violating agricultural time and taking care of production. Second, it closely cooperates with the central work of the countryside, reflects the current reality, performs real people and real events, and praises the exemplary deeds of new heroes of the masses. Third, in organizational leadership, it does not engage in independence and obeys the leadership of the village government; in economic terms, it does not waste people's resources and solves difficulties by itself. Fourth, the performance form is short and concise, and the creation follows the mass line.
    Second, professional rural theater troupes (county theater troupes) should provide various assistance and support to village theater troupes, pay attention to the influence of their own style, and strive to avoid extravagance and waste, performing only large-scale plays, and the tendency of not cooperating with reality and separating from the masses. And the army cultural troupes and the administrative office troupes should appropriately help the rural theater troupes, establish close ties, and play a considerable leading role. The convergence of these three aspects will inevitably greatly promote the theater movement. --The above principles have already been clarified, but there are still deviations in specific implementation, so I would like to reiterate them again.
    5. Another extremely widespread mass creative movement, the clapper talk movement, has a very surprising influence and effect in the vast countryside today! Regardless of men, women, old or young, they are familiar with and can master this form, reflecting so quickly and universally the events that occur in a family or a village, and spreading so quickly. It is truly "what is heard, what is advocated" and "everyone knows it." This is an unprecedented artistic movement that has emerged from the masses. During the land reform movement, it produced many vivid and encouraging clapper talks, through which one can even understand the various joints of the land reform movement in a village. Unfortunately, literary and artistic workers may not have collected and studied this very well and extensively, perhaps because it is too common, so we have been somewhat "accustomed to it and have not seen it" in the past.
    6. In the future, publications in various regions should freely and extensively publish mass creations, and literary and artistic workers should actively mobilize and organize mass creations, and participate in mass creations with the aim of humbly learning and transforming themselves, and carry out the rural literary and artistic creation movement.
    Today, the most spectacular thing in the literary and artistic movement in the border areas is the rural literary and artistic movement. If literary and artistic workers do not invest in this mass literary and artistic movement and closely link their work, creation, and this movement, then we will be separated from the masses and our literary and artistic activities will be disconnected from mass literary and artistic activities! To this end, I would like to put forward the above points to exchange views with literary and artistic workers, encourage and urge each other, and work together to carry out this unprecedented rural literary and artistic movement in history.

　　关于农村文艺运动
    荒煤
    在边区文艺座谈会上，听到王亚平同志报告了冀鲁豫文联民间艺术部改造民间艺人及民间艺术的工作，引起了大家对边区农村文艺活动热烈的关切与讨论。大家一致认为：边区农村文艺运动早已蓬勃发展（虽然有的地区较强，有的地区较弱）但一般文艺工作者对此恐怕还不能说已经有足够的重视。
    我个人想到以下几个问题，还应该提出来和各地区文艺工作同志再作研究与商榷：
    一、开展边区文艺运动，是否应该首先注意农村文艺活动的培植与推动，作为新文艺运动基本环节之一？今天边区农村的文艺运动，是在广大群众翻身的基础上开展起来的。凡是在翻身运动搞得好的地区，农村艺术活动就非常活跃与普遍，反之就显得消沉。这是“群众翻身，自唱自乐”的运动，是群众翻身后自发的迫切的要求，也惟有这个运动才能真正直接给人民“雪里送炭”，普及到如此广大分散的农村环境中去。同时，许多的事实证明了：群众一旦以主人翁姿态走上艺术舞台，立即表现了生气勃勃的，有力量的，有丰富创造的艺术才能！他们完全可以并善于掌握艺术武器，从此开辟、扩大了文艺路线的新天地！也只有依靠这样的群众力量，才能抵制旧戏、推动民间艺人走向改造、废除迷信及封建思想残余的束缚与影响，为新文艺运动扫清障碍，占领前所未有的广大新阵地。因之，文艺工作者必须明确自己的思想，认识到这个问题的重要性，应该即时密切注意；关心这个运动的发展，经常进行调查研究，了解情况，发现典型，培养典型，总结经验，借以推动与开展这个运动。
    过去各地区某些文教部门及文艺工作者对于农村文艺运动都起了不少的启发、组织与领导作用，积累和创造了许多宝贵的经验，可惜有些工作，各地文联及文艺工作者与文教部门之间的联系与配合不够，文艺工作者也没有把这个工作当作自己的责任。有时文教部门对业务熟悉不够，又难予以具体帮助，提高其技术；再加上领导不够经常，经验总结与交流不够，以致运动不能更好推进一步。今后文艺工作者最好积极配合文教部门，迅速对这方面工作加以总结，借以弥补各地发展之不平衡现象。
    二、我觉得，开展农村文艺运动，团结与改造民间艺人和旧艺人也是一重要关键。各地经验都证明，民间艺人及旧艺人都有熟练的技术，一般都熟悉群众生活，又大都是贫苦出身，因而这种改造，使他们转变到为群众服务，是完全可能、并且已经收到很大效果，冀鲁豫文联民间艺术部的工作就是很好的例子。倒如太行许多著名的农村剧团，很多就是由旧戏班子改造过来的。再如武乡、左权的肓人宣传队，阳城刘金堂朗诵队等，都是经过改造的民间艺人。这方面经验很不少，但也缺乏有系统的了解与总结。
    三、今天边区农村文艺运动中还是以戏剧最为活跃，普遍，成绩最大。特别经过一年的土地改革运动，更是飞跃发展，无论在数量与质量上都前进了一大步。但根据所了解的情形，去年邯郸边区文化工作者大会上关于农村剧团的总结，今天仍然是正确适用的。凡是根据这个方针来成立的农村剧团就有发展。第一、确定是群众性业余活动，不违农时，照顾生产。第二、与农村的中心工作密切配合，反映当前现实，演真人真事，表扬群众新英雄的模范事迹。第三、在组织领导上不闹独立性，服从村政领导；在经济上不浪费民力，自己动手解决困难。第四、演出形式短小精悍，创作走群众路线。
    其次，职业农村剧团（县剧团）对村剧团应该多方面的帮助与扶植，注意自己的作风的影响，应力求避免铺张浪费，专演大戏，不配合实际脱离群众的倾向。而部队文工团专门与行署剧团都应该适当的帮助农村剧团，建立密切联系，起相当的领导作用。这三方面汇合起来必然大大的推动剧运。——以上这些方针都是早已明确了的，惟具体执行时仍有偏差，特再申述一下。
    五、另一个极其普遍的群众性的创作运动，快板运动，在今天广大农村所起的影响与作用是非常惊人的！无论男女老幼都熟悉并且能掌握这个形式，那样迅速普遍的反映一家、一村的所发生事迹，而且流行传播得那样快。真是有所闻、有所倡，就“有口皆传”。这是从群众涌现出来的一个空前的艺术运动，在土地改革运动中，曾经产生了不少生动的，充满鼓励情绪的快板，通过它甚至就可以了解这一个村的土地改革运动中的各个关节的尾末。很可惜，文艺工作者对此可能都没有很好的广泛的进行搜集与研究，也许因为它过于普遍，所以我们过去多少有些“熟视无睹”罢。
    六、今后各地区出版物应该放手大量的刊载群众创作，文艺工作者应该去积极发动和组织群众创作，并且以虚心学习、改造自己为目的去参加群众创作，开展农村文艺创作运动。
    今天边区文艺运动中最轰轰烈烈的，是农村文艺运动文艺工作者，不投入这一个群众的文艺运动中去，把自己的工作、创作和这个运动密切联系起来，那我们就会脱离群众，使我们的文艺活动与群众文艺活动脱节！为此，一般地提出以上几点希望与文艺工作者交换意见，互相勉励督促，共同努力，来开展这个历史上空前的农村文艺运动。
