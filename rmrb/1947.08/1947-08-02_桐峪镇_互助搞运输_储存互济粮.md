    Tongyu Town
    Mutual Aid for Transportation
    Storing Mutual Assistance Grain
    [This newspaper's dispatch from Zuoquan] In the Tongyu area of the Third District, various mutual aid teams have launched a savings competition. All eight large teams in the town have made specific calculations. On July 15th, each team established a mutual assistance grain group to supplement the deficits of households with insufficient food. The method is to fully organize the labor force of each team. During the intervals after weeding, they engage in transportation to earn income. The remaining profit, after deducting costs, is used to buy millet, which is stored by each group for distribution to families lacking grain. The benefits are that it can consolidate the mutual aid groups and solve the practical difficulties of the members. Currently, there are thirty-two groups in the town, each storing one stone and five dou of rice, totaling forty-eight stones. Over 10,000 catties have already been purchased. The team members happily say, "The government is always thinking of us and even comes up with solutions when we lack food. Who cared about us before!"

    桐峪镇
    互助搞运输
    储存互济粮
    【本报左权讯】三区桐峪各互助队，展开了节约竞赛，全镇八个大队，都作了具体的算帐，七月十五日各队都成立了互济粮组，补充不够吃的户窟窿。作法是将各队劳力全数组织起来，苗锄完的空隙，出外搞运输，赚回的除本外余下红利买成小米，各组保存起来，谁家缺粮，可作调剂。好处是能巩固互助组，又能解决组员切身困难。现全镇三十二组，每组存一石五斗米，共计买四十八石，现已买下一万余斤。组员高兴的说：“政府处处是为咱们打算，没吃还给想出办法，以前谁管咱哩！”
