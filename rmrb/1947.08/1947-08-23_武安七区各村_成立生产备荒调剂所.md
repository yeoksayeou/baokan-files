　　Villages in the Seventh District of Wu'an
　　Establish Production and Famine Relief Adjustment Offices
    [Report from this newspaper, Wu'an] In order to conserve resources for long-term famine relief, the villages in the seventh district of Wu'an have recently established production and famine relief adjustment offices, with a district-level general adjustment office. The main tasks are to adjust sideline gathering and cutting, and to store famine relief grain. When they were established, liberated peasant women enthusiastically invested their fruits, money from gathering and cutting, and private money. For example, Li You, a woman from Guantao, said: "In 1943, it was the cooperative that led us to spin and weave cloth that saved us from the disaster; now that we are all liberated households, we should invest more to get through this disaster again." Hu Qi said, "Now that this has become the business of our farmers' association, we must resolutely invest." Under his influence, 64 people voluntarily invested. Guantao originally planned for 300,000, but exceeded the plan by 160,000. Ma@ village also exceeded the original plan, investing 170,000. The masses in Yangyi also actively strived to be models, exceeding the original plan. After a meeting on the evening of the third, each street was mobilized on the fourth. Everyone felt that the adjustment office was their own, that it could adjust gathering and cutting, guarantee food, generate profits and dividends, and not waste anything, so this was a great thing. The whole town invested a total of 2.6 million. Liu Yuying, a woman, invested her beloved silver bracelet and two pieces of clothing at a discount. Under her influence, women in the east street invested 150,000. The entire task was completed on the eighth, and now each village is still expanding its capital. (Xi Chen)

　　武安七区各村
  　成立生产备荒调剂所
    【本报武安讯】武安七区为长期节约备荒，最近各村纷纷成立生产备荒调剂所，区成立总调剂所，主要工作是调剂副业拾砍，储蓄备荒粮食。成立时翻身农民妇女都踊跃的把自己的果实、拾砍的钱、己钱都入了股。如管陶妇女李有的说：“四三年渡灾荒就是联合社领导纺花织布才救活了咱；现在咱们都是翻身户，应该多入股，再渡这个灾荒。”胡齐的说：“现在成了咱农会的生意，咱要坚决入股”。在他影响之下，有六十四人都自动入股。管陶原计划三十万，结果超过计划十六万。马＠村也超过原订计划，入股十七万。阳邑群众也积极争取模范，完成超过了原订计划，三日晚开罢会后，四日各街总动员，大家一致感到，调剂所是自己的，能调剂拾砍，又能保证有吃的，又能生利分红，又浪费不了，这个事太好了。全镇共入股二百六十万，妇女刘玉英，把自己心爱物银手镯一付和衣服两件，折价入了股。在她的影响下，东街妇女入了十五万元。全八日已完成了全部任务，现各村还在扩大股金。（洗尘）
