　　Literary Magazine Calls on
  　Comrades in Counties and Districts to Widely Contribute Articles
    [Report from this newspaper] The literary magazine published by the Taihang Federation of Literary and Art Circles, in order to further reach the masses, calls on comrades in counties and districts to widely contribute articles. Since its inception, and after a year of exploration and effort, the magazine has now become shorter in length, more realistic in content, and gradually more accessible to the general public. Recently, comrades from the magazine conducted a review and concluded that while the literary magazine has achieved some success, it is still not adequate in terms of developing local literary writing movements, especially in coordinating with the central tasks of each period. In the future, in order to integrate the literary magazine with the broad masses and to coordinate as much as possible with the central tasks of each period, so that it becomes a publication written and run by the masses themselves, a call is made to comrades in counties and districts to widely contribute articles, and the slogan "write about what you do" is put forward. Secondly, cultural and educational organizations in each county are called upon to widely collect creations from the masses, so as to disseminate and absorb their strengths, and to ensure that every work in the magazine can become something that the masses like to see and hear.

　　文艺杂志号召
  　县区同志广泛写稿
    【本报讯】太行文联出版之文艺杂志，为更进一步深入群众特号召县区同志。广泛写稿。该刊自创刊以来，经过一年来的摸索与努力，现已作到篇幅短小，内容现实性加强，并逐渐通俗。日前该社同志进行检讨，认为文艺杂志虽已获得一些成绩，但在开展地方文艺写作运动上，尤其在与每时期的中心工作配合上，还很不够。今后为了使文艺杂志与广大群众结合，并尽量与每个时期的中心工作配合，成为群众自写自办的刊物，特号召县区同志广泛写稿，并提出做啥写啥的口号。其次号召各县文教机关，广泛搜集群众创作，以便传播并吸收其点，使刊物上的每篇作品，均能成为群众所喜见乐闻的东西。
