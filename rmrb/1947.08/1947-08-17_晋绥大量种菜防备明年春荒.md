Xinhua News Agency, Jin-Sui, 14th: The five million soldiers and civilians of the Jin-Sui region, united as one to fight against the drought unseen in forty years, finally completed the task of replanting and additional planting before the beginning of autumn. Currently, cadres and soldiers throughout the region are saving four taels of millet per person per day and are massively planting autumn vegetables, planning for each person to contribute 300 jin of vegetables to prepare for this year's poor harvest and next year's spring famine. This disaster relief struggle has three major characteristics: (1) The leadership has a mass perspective, firmly grasping "production and preparation for famine as the central task," mobilizing the masses to fight against the disaster. Before the rain, they persuaded the masses to abandon the idea of waiting for rain and to implement dry planting, digging ditches and wells for irrigation. County and district governments collected early-maturing crop seeds in advance to prepare for replanting after the rain. After the light rain in mid-June, they called for a sudden rush to plant and cultivate, but because the rainfall was too little, many seedlings still died due to drought. By late July, the drought became even more severe, so the slogans "Fight to avoid starvation or reduce starvation" and "Fight to rescue the disaster and save the dying" were put forward, and a large number of melons, vegetables, and early-maturing crops were planted, calling for "producing everything that can be eaten" and "planting every mu that can be planted." In late July, widespread heavy rain fell in various places, so the call was made to "not waste a single mu of cultivated land," launching a final rush to plant and replant buckwheat and autumn vegetables. Therefore, the enthusiasm of the masses was greatly mobilized, and they fully responded to the government's call, displaying an amazing spirit of tenacious struggle. In some areas, farmers had sown the same piece of land up to four times before and after the general rain. (2) First, take care of the poor masses, with a clear class line. Priority is given to allocating the fruits of land reform and grain from public granaries, mobilizing the masses to lend to each other. Landlords who intentionally leave land uncultivated and land that has not yet been distributed are first handed over to poor peasants, hired laborers, and middle peasants for emergency planting. In terms of regions, priority is also given to villages with the most severe disaster and relatively poor conditions, launching a mutual assistance movement in which urban areas help rural areas and plains help mountainous areas. (3) All troops, organizations, and schools are fully mobilized, contributing all manpower and animal power to help the masses with emergency planting. The Jin-Sui Sub-Bureau of the CPC called on everyone to "test their attitude and sense of responsibility towards the people in the preparation for famine." The border government-level organizations and troops alone provided 10,000 man-days of labor. A certain regiment of the Field Army, just returning from combat, also helped seven villages plant more than 2,000 mu in two days. Various localities also conducted in-depth inspections, and when they found barren land or missing seedlings, they immediately replanted. Border troops widely launched attacks to protect the masses' emergency planting.

　　晋绥大量种菜防备明年春荒
    【新华社晋绥十四日电】晋绥五百万军民团结一致与四十年来所未有之旱灾作斗争，终于在立秋前完成抢种补种任务。现全区干部及战士每人每日节约四两小米，大规模播种秋菜，计划每人交菜三百斤，以备今年歉收明年春荒。此次救灾大斗争有三大特色：（一）领导上具有群众观点，紧紧掌握“生产备荒为当前中心任务”，发动群众与灾荒斗争。雨前说服群众放弃等雨思想，实行干种，开挖沟渠井泉从事灌溉，县区政府事先筹集早熟作物种籽，以备雨后补种。六月中旬各地微雨后即号召突击抢种抢耘，但因雨量太少，禾苗仍多旱死。至七月下旬，旱象更趋严重，乃提出“为不饿死人或少饿死人而斗争”“为救灾救死而斗争”的口号，大量种植瓜菜及早熟作物，号召“生产一切能吃的东西”，“能种一亩算一亩”。七月下旬各地普降透雨，乃提出“不荒一亩熟地”，发动最后抢种，补栽荞麦秋菜。因此大大发动了群众的积极性，全力响应政府号召，发挥了惊人的顽强斗争精神，若干地区农民在普雨前后，同一块土地上有曾播种达四次之多者。（二）首先照顾贫苦群众，阶级路线分明。尽先拨与清算果实及义仓粮，发动群众互借，地主有意荒芜及尚未分配的土地，先交贫雇农及中农抢种。在地区上亦首先照顾灾情最重和较贫苦的村庄，发动城关帮助农村，平川帮助山地的互助运动。（三）部队机关学校全体总动员，拿出一切人力畜力，帮助群众抢种。中共晋绥分局号召每个人“在备荒中去考验对人民的态度和责任心”，仅边府一级机关部队即帮人工一万个。野战军某团才作战归来，亦于两天内帮助七个村抢种二千余亩。各地并深入检查，发现荒地或缺苗时随即补种，边沿部队即广泛出击以掩护群众抢种。
