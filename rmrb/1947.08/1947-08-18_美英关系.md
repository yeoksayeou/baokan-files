Translator's Note: This article is translated from the English version of the Soviet magazine "New Times" of January this year. Although the time is a bit too long, its viewpoints and statistics still have practical significance and are relatively detailed and systematic. Therefore, the entire article is translated for readers' reference.

The Three Stages of US-British Relations

Generally speaking, the history of US-British relations since World War II can be divided into three distinct stages:

The first stage was the early period of the war, from the German invasion of Poland to June 22, 1941 (the outbreak of the Soviet-German War). During this period, Britain relied almost entirely on the United States, especially after the fall of France. At that time, Britain had neither a good army nor good military equipment, and lacked food and military supplies. Its industry was only just beginning to switch to a wartime footing. The United States declared complete sympathy for Britain, and Roosevelt even said that the United States was the "arsenal of democracy."

In the summer of 1940, Britain obtained a large number of rifles from the United States (at that time, Britain even lacked rifles). Immediately afterwards, Britain exchanged eight bases in the Caribbean and other regions for fifty old destroyers from the United States; and also obtained trucks, machine tools, food and other necessities for wartime. On the other hand, Britain had to take out part of its savings to pay for the materials obtained from the United States (the Lend-Lease Act had not yet been implemented at that time); specifically, this was the inflow of British funds into the United States.

At that time, many British people said uneasily that if this situation continued, by the end of the war, Britain would find itself economically a "vassal" of the United States. However, after the failure of France, Britain's predicament forced her to express her concerns to the United States only hesitantly. Many Americans openly said that after the war, Britain would become the European outpost of the "Anglo-American alliance" centered on Washington.

When Germany attacked the Soviet Union, US-British relations entered the second stage; Hitler's provocation in the East not only reduced the military threat to Britain, but also actually eliminated Britain's complete dependence on the United States. She now had two powerful allies (the US and the Soviet Union) instead of one. She traditionally began to implement a strategy of swaying between the two.

The United States also joined the war on December 7, 1941, and Britain's situation improved even more, because the contrast between a neutral United States and a Britain at war was certainly not as beneficial to Britain as when both Britain and the United States were participating in the war.

During the mid-war period, Britain was able to significantly strengthen its international position; its military situation, industrial and economic resources all developed to their peak. By the end of the war, Britain's position in the "Big Three" conferences was completely equal to that of the Soviet Union and the United States, and it had an independent foreign policy.

After the defeat of Germany and Japan, US-British relations entered the third stage. The world was facing the handling of many post-war problems. Britain struggled out of the war, economically and politically weakened, but not to the extent of affecting its world status; if measures were taken properly, Britain could easily maintain its international status during the mid-war period and adopt an independent foreign policy.

However, on the contrary, after the end of the war, the Labour government, which gained power, stubbornly turned anti-Soviet and was enthusiastic about the "Anglo-American alliance." Because the United States was superior to Britain in economic and military strength, Britain naturally became the "follower" of the United States. Compared with the situation in 1939-40, it is not that she has no other options now, but because the Labour government intentionally followed the reactionary line formulated by Churchill and his partners and applied it to diplomacy. Britain's renewed dependence on the United States is clearly shown in the US-British loan agreement, and Britain simply made a losing deal.

What is the secret purpose of the "Anglo-American alliance"? Churchill's supporters and their partners in the United States and Britain understand very well that the main purpose is to establish US-British "leadership" in the post-war world; in other words, to establish a united world sovereignty for the monopoly capitalists.

Facts tell us that this kind of conspiracy is no longer in the preparation stage, but is increasingly appearing in the form of a stubborn policy. Needless to say, this policy is dressed in the cloak of anti-communism, and in fact it damages the sovereignty and independence of those countries that do not accept the rule of the "Anglo-American alliance." A conspiracy to rule the world by one power or a group of powers is often reactionary and illusory. Today, due to the result of World War II, the world has undergone drastic changes. Independent countries not only know the need for freedom, but their independence has been greatly enhanced; the people of colonies and dependent countries have also greatly increased their demands for liberation, and they are determined to obtain at least the basic conditions for independent survival.

The British supporters of the "Anglo-American alliance" have tried their best to say that under the current circumstances, the power of the British Empire cannot helplessly win world hegemony. They are arranging their identities according to the role of "follower partners" and placing their country on the chariot of American imperialism.

This is only one aspect of US-British relations. This aspect of the factors makes the relationship between the two countries closer.

But there is another side to US-British relations. Many of its factors show the contradictions between the United States and Britain, bringing great shadows to the two countries.

Economic Contradictions Between the United States and Britain

Before World War I, Britain's balance of payments often had a surplus. For example, in 1913, the amount of this surplus reached £181,000,000.

After World War I, Britain's economic situation began to deteriorate and was immediately reflected in the balance of payments. In the 1920s, although difficulties continued to increase, Britain was still able to make up for the deficit, but in the 1930s after the 1929 economic crisis, Britain's economic situation quickly became worse. Sufficient materials show that the balance of payments for the five years from 1934 to 1938 averaged an annual deficit of £19,000,000.

This situation has developed more rapidly since World War II. On the one hand, trade has declined day by day, and on the other hand, those "invisible exports" have also decreased rapidly.

Among those invisible exports, the most important are the profits from foreign investment and the income from shipping freight. From 1934 to 1938, the income from those invisible exports averaged £328,000,000 per year, of which profits from foreign investment accounted for £192,000,000 and freight also accounted for £92,000,000. But during the war, Britain spent nearly half of her foreign investment. Compared with the investment amount of £4,000,000,000 in 1938, it is now only a little more than £2,000,000,000. In other words, her income from this source will be reduced by about half. As for shipping income, it has been in serious danger since World War II.

Here are some eloquent figures: In 1939, the total amount of merchant ships of more than 1,000 tons in capitalist countries was 62,000,000 tons, of which Britain had 17,000,000 tons, accounting for 27 percent; the United States had 11,000,000 tons, accounting for 18 percent; and the rest of the countries accounted for 34,000,000 tons. However, in 1945, the total amount of world merchant ships exceeded 72,000,000 tons, of which Britain had only 11,000,000 tons, accounting for 15 percent; the United States had 43,000,000 tons, almost accounting for 60 percent; and other countries only had the remaining 18,000,000 tons. This means that Britain is now encountering a terrible shipping rival, the United States, which has resulted in a sharp decline in her shipping industry income.

After the war, Britain faced great difficulties in balancing payments. If the deficit situation is not eliminated, Britain will become a permanent debtor. Therefore, foreign trade has a great impact on the British national economy and restricts her entire economic life, especially for the stability of currency.

But how can the imbalance of payments be eliminated?

Today, Britain can only try to reduce imports and increase exports. In other words, Britain must reduce her trade deficit to a certain extent so that the sharply reduced invisible exports after the war can be increased enough to compensate for this deficit.

How can imports be reduced? Britain can only try to reduce the import of food and manufactured goods, which exceeded 70 percent of Britain's total imports in 1938. It is difficult to implement the restriction of raw material imports because Britain urgently needs to use its manufactured goods to increase exports.

How can exports be increased? Only by exporting a large number of manufactured goods. In 1938, Britain's exports of manufactured goods accounted for 70 percent of total exports.

If Britain's balance of payments is to have a sound foundation, the above are the most basic conditions - internal conditions.

However, external conditions must also be available, that is, Britain must arrange a large market for its own export goods. According to British economists' estimates, Britain must increase its exports compared to 1938 in order to turn the deficit balance of payments into a surplus balance of payments; it should increase by 50 percent in 1947, and by 75 percent in 1948. Judging from newspaper reports (for example, the report of the London "Economist" on August 3, 1946), Britain's exports have exceeded the pre-war level in the middle of last year and can continue to increase, so Britain must find a market. Can she find it? The main key depends on US-British relations.

What was the situation in the British Empire market before the war?

In 1938, 50 percent of British export goods were shipped to various parts of the empire, 33 percent to Europe, 12 percent to the Americas, and a little more than 3 percent to Asian countries. Therefore, Britain's most valuable markets before the war were British territories and Europe.

The situation today is still similar to that in 1938. The only difference is that the importance of the imperial market is even greater than in 1938, because Europe has become extremely poor after the war.

So, it is very obvious that if Britain wants to improve the balance of payments, it must defend its old markets and strive to open up new markets.

But the United States needs markets no less than she does. The United States' industrial production increased by nearly two and a half times during the war. If this production volume is returned to the pre-war level, it will lead to an economic crisis.

What were the United States' pre-war markets?

In 1938, 43 percent of US export goods were shipped to Europe, 34 percent to other countries in the Americas, 19 percent to Asia and Oceania, and 3 percent to Africa. So, the main markets of the United States are in Europe and other countries in the Americas.

Now, even if the United States has acquired more important markets, the markets in other countries in the Americas are still indispensable. Europe has greatly reduced its importance due to the war, although the United States has recently spent no small effort to restore it and expand the US position. Therefore, American enterprises are doing everything possible to open up new markets for their goods. They are paying special attention to the markets of China and the British Empire.

In China, they have squeezed Britain into a secondary position. For the British Empire market, a fierce decisive battle is being prepared. In the terms of the US-British economic agreement in 1945, if Britain does not completely abandon the imperial preference system, at least it greatly weakens the protection of the imperial market, which will allow Britain to give up 50 percent of the export market. (⑶⑷)

The abolition or increased weakening of this preferential system will lead to a reduction in the production of certain British industries. It aptly illustrates how the United States achieves the purpose of plundering the British Empire market under the slogan of "equal opportunity."

What comes with this?

What comes with this is some economic contradictions between the United States and Britain, the most important of which is market competition, especially the European market and the internal market of the British Empire; and the struggle for maritime trade.

Military and Political Contradictions Between the United States and Britain

However, the contradictions between the United States and Britain are not limited to the economic aspect, but also in the military and political aspects.

The most important issue among them is naturally the naval issue. As is well known, Britain is extremely sensitive to everything about naval armaments. Because the territory of the British Empire around the world is created and maintained by the navy. Until 1914, the basic principle of British strategy was to maintain its naval power to the extent that it must be equal to the sum of the naval power of the other two major powers (the United States and Japan). Although this principle was not announced, it was indeed implemented in practice.

World War I changed this situation. At the Washington Conference in 1922, Britain was forced to agree that the United States should have naval power equal to its own. Although the naval power of the United States did not actually reach the same level as that of Britain between the two world wars, this was still a serious blow to Britain. Now that the US naval power is twice that of Britain, it is easy to understand what attitude Britain has. Because the naval issue is related to the future of the British Empire.

The situation in the air force is also the same. Although it is difficult for us to find actual figures to illustrate the comparison of air force power between the United States and Britain, it is undeniable that the US air force power is several times that of Britain and the US aircraft production far exceeds that of Britain. Due to the increasing importance of transportation, military aviation, and civil aviation, the contradictions that have now been caused between the United States and Britain will become increasingly intense with the passage of time. Don't be surprised that the United States and Britain still signed an aviation agreement under such contradictions, because that kind of agreement will not last long.

The issue of naval, land and air force bases is also part of the US-British contradiction. Britain has hundreds of such bases around the world, but next to British bases, there is a US base network, which is still expanding. US bases are either parallel to British bases or interspersed among British bases. Britain has no way to prevent this from happening, and of course she will be very unhappy.

Britain's situation is also not very good on the issue of atomic bombs. Because the secret of the atomic bomb seems to be given to Britain as a secret. Isn't it easy to understand that US-British relations are full of what latent dangers!

Another dangerous area in US-British relations is the issue of colonies and resources. Britain is now the largest colonial country in the world, with 530 million people. The United States is just on the stage of expansion, and it will conflict with Britain all over the world. Even if it is said that this situation will not cause a serious struggle between the United States and Britain, at least it will make it impossible for them to live in peace.

If all these are added to the continuous political struggles between the United States and Britain in Latin America, Europe, the Near East, India, Malaya, Japan and many other places, then a picture of US-British military and political contradictions will be very clear and understandable.

The Beginning of a New Stage in US-British Relations

Based on the above observations, US-British relations are really a complex mixture of both contradictory and combined factors.

There are two main reasons for the combination:

The first reason is due to the wartime conventions, when fighting against a common enemy, the United States and Britain try to coordinate on major issues.

The second reason is that the reactionary elements of the United States and Britain united after the war to establish the world hegemony of the "Anglo-American alliance" and opposed the world's democratic forces. Churchill's speech in Fulton, USA, is clear proof of this situation. The Labour government put Britain on the US chariot and has long advocated an Anglo-American alliance. For example, it is shown in the negotiations on the standardization of military equipment between the two countries.

However, recently, the increase in the contradictions of US-British interests has shown a trend. Because the contradictions between the two countries are only covered up by time, not that they do not exist. When the years of war have passed, when the anti-Soviet clamor is futile and increasingly turns into a conspiracy by democratic forces against the US-British rule of the world, the contradictions of US-British interests become more and more obvious.

The most obvious signs of this situation are the US elections last November and the "rebellion" of Labour MPs in the British Parliament.

In the US elections last November, the Republican Party won a victory, so it now controls the entire US Congress. There are many reasons to believe that the Republican Party may also win in the presidential election in early November next year. However, the Republican Party's policies often drive the private interests of the United States to be in a hostile position with the interests of other countries, including Britain. There is no reason to doubt that the coming economic crisis will strengthen this political line in the United States, and the effect of the economic crisis will also occur in Britain.

From the perspective of British interests, nearly one-third of the "rebellious" Labour MPs criticized the British government's policies in the parliamentary debate on the King's speech last year.

In fact, this kind of criticism has been heard several times in the British House of Commons. But in the past, it was only the Labour Party's left-wing group that attacked Bevin's policies, and their main argument was to advocate the necessity of close cooperation between Britain and the Soviet Union. However, this time, among the opponents of the British government, there are not only left-wing members, but many critics of the government are representatives of other groups within the Labour Party, even the right-wing group. Among these people are Crossman, Michael Foot, and others who have no pro-Soviet color. The main argument of "rebel" leader Crossman and many others is to liberate Britain from the shackles of the United States and restore its own independent foreign policy.

On November 22 last year, Crossman said at a rally in London as a "rebel":

"We cannot agree with the meaning of the so-called 'free trade' of the United States, allowing the United States to export its unemployment, rule the world market, harm other countries, and give us loans in the form of political oppression. If we are on either side of the United States and the Soviet Union, we will become weak. If we cooperate with both the United States and the Soviet Union and maintain our independence, we will be strong."

These words are very true. We know that Crossman is not asking for friendship with the Soviet Union. He is clearly enthusiastic about Britain's traditional policy of turning to the wind. But there is one thing he is very clear about, that is, Britain should not put itself on the US chariot as much as possible.

Another "rebel," Michael Foot, is an anti-Soviet element in all aspects, especially on the issue of Iran. But now he has the same view as Crossman. He published an article in "Tribune," pointing out that Britain should make itself an independent power, which is an indispensable condition for the success of all foreign policies. He said:

"What is the benefit of getting a world for Britain? If it is obtained, it will be taken away by the White House or Wall Street."

Of course, a proper conclusion for the future cannot be drawn from the "rebellion" of these Labour MPs, but it is a sign of the growing panic of the masses about the foreign policy of Attlee and Bevin. The masses are beginning to understand more clearly that the urgent problem for Britain today is to maintain its independence in international relations, or to become the outpost of US imperialism in Europe.

　　美英关系
    苏联·塔金著  陈＠译
    译者按：此文系从本年一月份苏联新时代杂志英文本译出，时间虽嫌过久，然而其观点及统计数字仍有现实意义，且比较详尽而有系统。故特全部译出，以供读者参考。
　　美英关系的三个阶段
    一般说来，二次大战以来，美英关系的历史可以分成三个很显著的阶段：
    第一阶段是从德国进攻波兰到一九四一年六月二十二日（苏德战争爆发）的战争初期，这时候英国几乎完全仰仗美国，特别是在法国沦陷以后。这时英国既无好的军队也无好的军备，缺乏食物和军事物资，工业刚刚才转入战时编制。美国则宣称完全同情英国，罗斯福并且说：美国是“民主国家的兵工厂”。
    一九四○年夏，英国从美国获得了大批的来福枪，（那时候英国甚至于来福枪都缺乏。）紧接着英国以她在加勒比海及其他地区的八个基地，又向美国换得了五十艘旧的驱逐舰；并且也得到了卡车、机器工具、食物以及其他战时最需要的东西。另一方面英国必须拿出储金的一部分以偿付从美国所获得的物资，（当时租借法案尚未实行）；具体地说，这是英国资金的流入美国。
    那时候，许多英国人不安地说，假如照这样情形下去，到战争结束时，英国将要发现她自己在经济上成了美国的“附庸”。但是在法国失败以后，英国的困窘迫使她只能向美国吞吞吐吐的表示她的不安的态度。许多美国人却公开地说：战后英国将成为以华盛顿为中心的“美英联盟”的欧洲前哨。
    到德国进攻苏联时，美英关系走入第二阶段；希特勒在东方的挑衅不只减轻了对英的军事威胁，而且实际上使英国消除了对美国的完全依附，她现在有了两个强有力的盟国（美、苏），而不是一个。她依照传统开始在两者之间实行摇摆的策略。
    一九四一年十二月七日美国也参加了战争，英国的处境便有了更多的改善，因为一个中立的美国和一个战争中英国的力量的对比，当然不及英美同样都是参加战争的国家那样对英国有利。
    战争中期，英国已经能够相当的增强了她的国际地位；她的军事情况、工业与经济资源都发展到顶点。到战争末期时，英国在“三强”会议中的地位已经完全平等于苏美，并且有着独立的外交政策。
    德日失败后，美英关系进入第三阶级。世界正面对着许多战后问题的处理，英国从战争中挣扎出来，在经济上和政治上都被削弱了，但是尚不至于影响她的世界地位；如果措施得宜，英国可能很容易的保持着在战争中期的国际地位，并且采取一种独立的外交政策。
    然而，恰恰相反，在战争结束以后，获得权力的工党政府固执的转而反苏，并且热中于“美英联盟”。由于美国在经济与军事上的力量都优于英国，于是英国自然地成了美国的“追随伙伴”。这与一九三九——四○年的情形相较，她现在这样作并不是没有他法可想，而是因为工党政府有意地追随邱吉尔及其伙伴们所拟制的反动路线而将它施于外交之中。英国的再度倚赖美国，从美英贷款协定中十分明白的显示出来，英国简直作了一个上当的买卖。
    什么是“美英联盟”的隐秘目的呢？邱吉尔的撑腰者及其在美英的伙友非常明白，主要是想在战后世界建立起美英的“领导”；换句话说，是替独占资本家们建立一个联合的世界主权。
    事实告诉我们，此种阴谋已经不是准备时期，而是日益以一种顽固政策的形态出现。不用说，这种政策是穿着反共产主义的外衣的，而实际上则是损害那些不接受“美英联盟”统治的国家的主权与独立。一种强权或者一个强权集团的统治世界的阴谋，常常是反动而又幻想的。今天由于二次世界大战的结果，世界已经起着剧变，独立的国家不仅知道自由的需要，而且他们的独立有了很大的增强；殖民地与附属国的人民对于解放的要求也有了巨大的增涨，他们决心至少要取得独立生存的基本条件。
    “英美联盟”的英国支持者竭力的说，在现在情况之下，大英帝国的力量不能无助的赢得世界霸权。他们是按照“追随伙伴”的角色来安排自己的身份的，而且把他们的国家去配置在美帝国主义的战车上。
    这仅是美英关系的一方面，这一方面的因素使得两国的关系密切起来。
    但是美英关系还有另外的一面，它的许多因素显示出美英之间的矛盾，带给两国间很大的阴影。
    美英经济的矛盾
    第一次世界大战前，英国的收支差额常是保有赢余的。例如在一九一三年，这种赢余的数目即达一八一、○○○、○○○英镑。
    第一次世界大战以后，英国的经济情况开始恶化，并且立刻从收支差额上表现出来。在二十年代，虽然困难不断的增长，英国仍能设法弥补亏空，但是在三十年代一九二九年经济危机以后，英国的经济情况就迅速的变得更坏。足够的材料说明一九三四——三八年五年间的收支差额，每年平均要亏空一九、○○○、○○○英镑。
    这种情形，二次世界大战以来更加急剧的发展，一方面贸易日益衰落，另一方面那些“看不见的出口”也迅速的减少。
    在那些看不见的出口中，最主要的是国外投资的利润与船舶运费的收入。一九三四——三八年那些看不见的出口的收入，每年平均总数为三二八、○○○、○○○英镑，其中国外投资的利润占一九二、○○○、○○○英镑，运费亦占九二、○○○、○○○英镑。但是在战争期间，英国耗去了她的国外投资将近一半。一九三八年的投资数目四、○○○、○○○、○○○英镑相较现在则仅仅二、○○○、○○○、○○○英镑多一些。换句话说，她从这项来源所得的收入，大约要减少至一半。至于船舶的收入，自二次世界大战以后更陷于严重的危险。
    这里有一些雄辩的数字：一九三九年资本主义国家一千吨以上的商船的总量为六二、○○○、○○○吨，英国有一七、○○○、○○○吨，占百分之二十七；美国有一一、○○○、○○○吨，占百分之十八；其余的国家则占三四、○○○、○○○吨。然而在一九四五年，世界商船总量超过七二、○○○、○○○吨，英国则仅有一一、○○○、○○○吨，占百分之十五；美国却有四三、○○○、○○○吨，快要占百分之六十；而其他的国家只占有剩余的一八、○○○、○○○吨。这意味着英国现在已经遇到一个可怕的船舶劲敌美国，其结果使她的海运业的收入，急剧地下降。
    战后，英国一样的面临着收支平衡的极大困难。如果亏空的情况不消除，英国就将成为一个永远的负责者。因此国外贸易极大的影响英国国民经济，束缚了她的整个经济生活，特别是对于通货的稳定。
    然而如何才能消除收支的不平衡呢？
    今天英国只有设法减少入口与增加出口。换句话说，英国必须减少她的贸易差额到一定程度，使战后那些锐减的看不见的出口增加到足以补偿此种差额。
    如何才能减少入口呢？英国唯有设法使粮食与制造品的输入减少，那些输入在一九三八年时曾超过英国入口总量的百分之七十。原料入口的节制是很难实行的，因为英国极其需要用它的制造品去增加出口。
    出口如何才能增加呢？唯有大量的输出制造品。英国在一九三八年时，制造品的输出曾是占输出总量的百分之七十的。
    如果英国的收支平衡要有健全的基础，上述那些就是最基本的条件——内在的条件。
    然而也必需备有外在的条件，那就是英国必须给她自己的出口货物安排下一个很大的市场。据英国经济家的估计，英国要把赤字的收支差额转变为结余的收支差额，必须要比一九三八年的出口增加；一九四七年应该增加百分之五十，一九四八年则需增加百分之七十五。根据报纸的报导来推断（例如敦伦“经济家”一九四六年八月三日的报导），去年年中英国的出口已超过了战前的水平，并且还能再继续增加，所以英国必须找寻市场。她能不能找得着呢？主要的关键就要看美英关系了。
    战前大英帝国市场的情况是怎样呢？
    一九三八年英国出口货物的百分之五十是运往帝国所属各地，百分之三十三运往欧洲，百分之十二运往美洲，百分之三强运往亚洲各国。因此英国战前最有价值的市场就是英属各地与欧洲。
    今天的情形仍和一九三八年相似，唯一不同的，就是帝国市场的重要性更比一九三八年增强了，因为欧洲在战后已变成了极端的贫困。
    所以，那是很明显的，英国如果要改进收支差额，必须去保卫她的老市场，并且还要努力去开辟新的市场。
    但是美国对于市场的需要也不下于她。美国在战争中工业生产增加了将近两倍半，如果使这种生产量回到战前的水平，就会招致经济危机。
    什么是美国战前的市场呢？
    在一九三八年，美国出口货物百分之四十三是运往欧洲，百分之三十四运往美洲其他各国，百分之十九运到亚洲和大洋洲，百分之三运到非洲。所以，美国主要的市场是在欧洲和美洲其他各国。
    现在，即使美国获得了更多重要的市场，美洲其他各国的市场仍是不可缺少的。欧洲由于战争的关系，已很大的减低其重要性，虽然美国最近曾费了不小的力气去恢复它和去扩张美国的地位。因此，美国的企业界竭尽一切力量去为他们的货物开辟新市场，他们特别注意中国和大英帝国的市场。
    在中国，他们已经把英国挤到次要的地位。对于大英帝国市场，则正准备了一个猛攻的决战。在一九四五年的美英经济协定的条款中，英国如果不是完全废弃帝国特惠制度，至少在实际上是极大的减弱了帝国市场的保护，它将使英国让出百分之五十的出口市场。（⑶⑷）
    这种特惠制度的废弃或增大的减弱将引致英国某些工业的减产。它很恰当的说明了美国在“机会均等”的口号下，如何达到掠取英帝国市场的目的。
    随此而来的是什么呢？
    随此而来的是美英在经济上的一些矛盾，最主要的是市场的竞争，特别是欧洲市场与大英帝国内部的市场；还有那海上贸易的争夺。
    美英军事与改治的矛盾
    然而，美英的矛盾还不仅限于经济方面，军事与政治两方面也是这样的。
    其中最重要的问题，自然是关于海军问题。如所周知，英国对于海军军备的每一件事都是极端敏感的。因为大英帝国在全球的领土，都是靠海军去开创与保持。直到一九一四年，英国战略的基本原则仍是维持其海军力量至必须等于其他两个海军强国（美、日）的总和的程度。这个原则虽未公布，而在实施上确是执行了的。
    第一次世界大战改变了这种情形，一九二二年的华盛顿会议，英国被迫同意美国所有与其同等的海军力量。虽然在两次世界大战之间，美国的海军力量实际上并未达到与英国相等，但这对于英国仍然是一个严重的打击。现在美国海军的力量已两依于英国的时候，英国究竟是个什么态度那是很容易了解的。因为海军的问题关连到大英帝国的前途。
    空军的情形也是一样的。我们虽然很难找出实际数字来说明美英空军力量的对比，然而美国空军力量数倍于英国及美国飞机生产量的远远超过英国，则是不容置疑的。由于交通上、军事航空与民运航空的重要性日益增长，美英间现在已因此引起了的矛盾，将随着时间的前进而愈加剧烈的发展。不要奇怪在这样矛盾之下美英在战后还订立了航空协定，因为那种协定不会存在得很久的。
    海陆空军基地的问题，也是美英矛盾的一部分。英国在全世界拥有好几百个这样的基地，然而在英国基地的旁边，却有着美国的基地网，而且还在继续扩大。美国的基地或者与英国的基地平列，或者交叉在英国的基地之中。英国一点也没有办法来阻止这种情形，当然她会很不愉快。
    在原子弹的问题上，英国处境也是不很好的。因为原子弹的秘密，似乎给予英国的也是秘密。难道还不容易了解吗，美英关系是充满了什么潜伏的危险！
    美英关系另一个危险的地带，是殖民地与资源问题。英国现在是世界最大的殖民地国家，她拥有五亿三千万的人民。美国却恰正走上扩张的阶段，他在世界各地都要与英国发生冲突，即使说此种情形不会引起美英间的严重斗争，至少也会使他们不可能相安无事。
    所有这些，如果再加上美英在拉丁美洲、欧洲、近东、印度、马来亚和日本以及其他许多地方的不间断的政治斗争，那么美英军事与政治矛盾的一幅图书就非常清楚而明白了。
    美英关系新阶段的开始
    根据上面的观察，美英关系实在是复杂的交织着矛盾与结合两种因素。
    结合的主要原因有两个：
    第一个原因是由于战争中的惯例，当与共同敌人作斗争的时候，美英两国尽力在重大问题上求得协调。
    第二个原因是由美英的反动分子为了建立“美英联盟”的世界霸权而在战后联合起来，反对世界民主力量。邱吉尔在美国富尔顿的演说，就是此种情形之明证。工党政府把英国配置于美国战车之上，并且早已提倡一个美英联盟。例如两国军备标准化的谈判中就显示出来。
    然而最近，美英利益矛盾的增长又显示出了是一种趋势。因为两国之间的矛盾，只不过是被时间掩蔽着，并不是没有存在。当战争的年代已经过去了的时候，当反苏的叫嚣已经徒劳无益而且日益变为民主力量反对美英统治世界的阴谋的时候，美英利益的矛盾就愈加显露。
    此种情形最明显的迹象是去年十一月美国的选举和英国国会中工党议员的“反叛”。
    去年美国十一月的选举，共和党获得了胜利，因而它现在控制着美国整个的国会。有很多根据可以相信在明年十一月初总统的选举中共和党也有可能获胜。然而共和党的政策，常常驱使美国的私利去和其他国家的利益处于敌对的地位，英国也包括在内。没有理由去怀疑行将到来的经济危机会使美国此种政治路线更加强化，而且经济危机的作用同样的会发生在英国身上。
    从英国利害观点上着眼，将近三分之一的“反叛”工党议员去年在国会辩论英王演说时抨击了英政府的政策。
    实际上，此种抨击在英国下院已经好几次的听到了。但是过去只是工党的左翼集团对于贝文政策的攻击，而且他们的主要论点是主张英苏密切合作的必要。然而这一次，英政府的反对者中，不仅是左翼集团分子，很多对政府的批评者都是工党内部其他集团甚至右翼集团的代表。这些人之中有着克罗斯曼，米卡尔·佛提等毫无亲苏色彩的人物。“反叛派”领袖克罗斯曼及其他许多人的主要论点是要把英国从美国的束缚下解放出来，恢复自己独立的外交政策。
    去年十一月二十二日，克罗斯曼以一个“反叛者”的身份在伦敦的一个集会上说道：
    “我们不能同意美国所谓的‘自由贸易’的意义，允许美国去输出她的失业，统治世界市场，损害其他国家，及以政治压迫的方式给予我们贷款。如果我们在美苏两国的任何一边，我们都会变成弱小，如果我们均同美苏合作而保持自己的独立，我们就会强大。”
    这些话非常真纯。我们知道，克罗斯曼并不是要求苏联的友谊，他很显明的热心于英国望风转蓬的传统政策。但是有一件事他是很明白的，即英国应尽可能不将自己配置在美国战车之上。
    另一个“反叛者”米卡尔·佛提是一个在各方面都反苏的分子，特别是关于伊朗问题上。可是现在也和克罗斯曼一样的看法。他在“论坛”上发表了一篇文章，指出：英国应当使自己成为一个独立的强国，是一切外交政策成功的不可缺少的条件。他说：
    “去获得一个世界对英国有什么利益？价如得来以后又被白宫或华尔街拿去。”
    自然还不能从这些工党议员的“反叛”得出一种适当的对未来的结论，但是它是广大群众对艾德礼与贝文外交政策恐慌增长的一种征兆。广大群众正在开始更清楚的了解英国今天迫切的问题，是在国际关系中保持自己的独立，抑或变成美帝国主义在欧洲的前哨。
