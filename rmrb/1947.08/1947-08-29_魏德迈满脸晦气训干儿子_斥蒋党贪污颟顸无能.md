Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 27th -- According to Nanjing Radio, when Wedemeyer left China on the 24th, he issued a statement admonishing his running dog Chiang Kai-shek's Kuomintang to "eliminate" corruption and "defeatism," and to "reform" politics and the economy in order to "eliminate" the power of the Chinese people and the Chinese Communist Party. In order to conceal the United States' poisonous plot to aid Chiang in the civil war to destroy China, and to attempt to continue deceiving the angry Chinese people, Wedemeyer, in a hypocritical manner, declared: "The Chinese people, who are suffering from internal strife, all desire peace." The statement also made unwarranted slanders against the Chinese Communist Party, demanding that the CCP lay down its arms voluntarily. The statement said: "I now see in various parts of China many phenomena of indifference, ruthlessness, and numbness, not seeking solutions to current problems, but spending considerable time and energy on condemning foreign influences or seeking foreign assistance. Most capable 'patriotic' (note: should be read as traitorous) Chinese, who should be full of hope and determination, are instead mired in despicable defeatism, which is truly disheartening." It also said: "What should be generally accepted is that military force alone cannot eliminate communism." Wedemeyer, putting on the airs of a master, rebuked the Kuomintang government for "the large number of people within it who are corrupt or ignorant and incompetent, or both corrupt and ignorant and incompetent, and whose reputations are notorious," demanding that Chiang Kai-shek implement so-called "drastic political and economic reforms," indicating that in this way Chiang Kai-shek could obtain the so-called "united and enthusiastic support of the majority of the Chinese people."

Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 27th -- Reuters, Nanjing, 25th: Luo Longji, Propaganda Director and Spokesperson of the China Democratic League, commented on Wedemeyer's statement upon leaving China, saying: Wedemeyer only talked about a few insignificant points and failed to come up with a concrete way to eliminate the civil war. Wedemeyer's request that the Communist Party stop using force against the (Chiang) government only puts forward a biased opinion.

　　魏德迈满脸晦气训干儿子
  　斥蒋党贪污颟顸无能
    【新华社陕北二十七日电】据南京广播，魏德迈于二十四日离华时发表声明，训诫其走狗蒋介石国民党“肃清”贪污及“失败主义”，“改革”政治经济以便“消灭”中国人民力量与中国共产党。魏德迈为掩饰美国援蒋内战灭亡中国的毒谋，和妄图继续欺骗愤怒的中国人民计，以猫哭老鼠方式宣称：“内争所苦之中国人民俱渴望和平”。该声明并对中国共产党横加诬蔑，要中共自动放下武器。声明称：“余今自见中国各地多有冷淡无情与麻木不仁之现象，对眼前之问题不求解决，而以相当之时间与精力掷于谴责外来之影响或觅取外来的协助。多数干练‘爱国’（按：应读为卖国）之中国人士，原应充满希望与决心者，反陷于可鄙的失败主义，言之诚属令人丧气。”又说：“一般所应接受者，即军事力量本身不能消灭共产主义”。魏德迈摆起主人的臭架子申斥国民党政府内“贪污或颟顸无能，或既贪污复颟顸无能而声名狼籍人士之众多，”要蒋介石实行所谓“大刀阔斧之政治及经济改革，”表示以此蒋介石即可获得所谓“大多数中国人民一致及热诚支持”。
    【新华社陕北二十七日电】路透社南京二十五日讯：民盟宣传主委兼发言人罗隆基评魏德迈离华声明称：魏德迈仅只谈论到无关痛的几点，并未能拟出取消内战的具体办法。魏德迈要求共产党停止使用武力反对（蒋）政府，仅只提出一种偏担的意见。
