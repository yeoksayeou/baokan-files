　　Nanping Wang Establishes Cattle Herd, Saving Three Million Per Year
    [Our newspaper, Zanhuang News] Nanping Wang Village has never established a cattle herd in the past. Everyone fed their own livestock. This year's situation has become problematic. Grain prices have risen. Feeding a cow requires ten catties of grass per day, at 20 yuan per catty, totaling 200 yuan. Half a sheng of feed costs 150 yuan. The total daily cost is 350 yuan, a monthly cost of 10,500 yuan, and an annual cost of 126,000 yuan. The masses generally reflect that they cannot afford to feed livestock. If they sell the livestock, they will have no way to farm. Some people say they should sell the livestock early and exchange it for grain to prepare for the famine. Deputy Village Chief Zhen Zhao convened a cadre meeting to study the establishment of a cattle herd. The annual wage for each livestock is three dou of corn. Each dou is calculated at 3,500 yuan, totaling only 10,500 yuan, saving more than 110,000 yuan per livestock per year. The village has a total of 54 livestock. In addition to those in use, 34 regularly join the herd, saving more than three million yuan a year. If grain is calculated at 4,000 yuan per shi, more than ninety shi of grain can be bought. In a year of famine, each person requires one shi, which can feed ninety-eight people. After calculation, the cattle herd was established. (Shuang Qing)

　　南坪旺成立牛群　一年节约三百万
    【本报赞皇讯】南坪旺村历年来没有成立过牛群，都是各喂各的牲口，今年的年景已成问题，粮价上涨，喂一头牛每天须草十斤，每斤廿元，合洋二百元，料半升须价洋一百五十元，每天共须用洋三百五十元，一个月须洋一万零五百元，一年须十二万六千元，群众普遍的反映喂不起牲口。如果把牲口卖了又没法养种地，有的群众说早些把牲口卖了换成粮食准备渡荒。副村长振召开干部会研究成立牛群，全年一头牲口出三斗玉茭工资，每斗按三千五百元算，才共折洋一万五百元，一年一个牲口就省十一万余元。全村共有牲口五十四头，除使用外，经常上群的有三十四个，一年即节约三百余万元，粮食每石按四千元算，可买九十余石粮食，灾荒年每口按一石计，即可养活九十八口人，经过算帐成立起牛群。（双庆）
