　　Xinhua News Agency, Shandong, 19th. Liu Shuzhen, of the Weihaiwei Municipal Government Health Department, has invented "Pulidian tablets," with a quality surpassing Ford ink. Two tablets can be used to make a bottle of Ford ink. The writing appears black on paper, gradually turning blacker, and becomes pure black after three days, never fading. Each jin costs only about 80 North Sea currency, and it is selling well in and around Jiaodong, resisting the invasion of foreign inks. Liu Shuzhen was therefore awarded a special prize by the municipal government. The recipe for the tablets is: seven qian of tannic acid, six qian of pure refined black alum, one qian of gum arabic (or peach oil as a substitute), five fen of German Double Dragon Blue dye, five fen of hydrochloric acid, and two qian of purified water. This ratio can make fifty tablets, each weighing three fen and three li. The preparation method is to grind all the raw materials into powder, add hydrochloric acid and purified water to make small tablets. Tannic acid is made by mixing two-thirds of gallnut acid and one-third of gallic acid. The method of making gallnut acid is to first boil gallnuts with water and filter, repeat three times. Take out the residue and place it in a warm place to allow it to mold and ferment (for seven to fourteen days), then heat it in a pot to evaporate the water, leaving a gelatinous substance, which turns into gallnut acid after cooling. The method of making gallic acid is the same.

　　刘书珍发明普利靛片
    【新华社山东十九日电】威海卫市政府卫生科刘书珍发明“普利靛片”，品质赛过福特墨水。两片即能泡成福特墨水一瓶，着纸后渐变黑色，三日后即变为纯黑色，永不褪色。每斤售价仅合北海币八十元左右，现畅销于胶东内外各地，抵制了外来墨水的侵入。刘书珍因此获得市府之特等奖金。该靛片系以鞣酸七钱，纯精黑矾六钱，阿拉伯树胶（或以桃树油代）德国双龙蓝一钱，盐酸五分，净水二钱之比数配合，可制成五十片，每片重三分三。其调制法，系将各种原料碾成粉末，加盐酸净水打成小片即成。鞣酸系以五倍子酸三分之二，没食子酸三分之一调和而成。五倍子酸制法，先将五倍子用水煮过滤，反复三遍，将渣取出放热处，使其生霉发酵（七天至十四天即可），再在锅内加热，使水分蒸发，所胶质，凉后变成五倍子酸。没食子酸的制法同此。
