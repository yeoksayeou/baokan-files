Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 30th -- The U.S. imperialist Wedemeyer and his "investigation mission" have been in Nanjing for over a week since their arrival on the 22nd. The arrival of this "investigation mission" is a humiliation for China, marking the further colonization of China under Chiang Kai-shek's rule. Even the Ta Kung Pao had to say: "Because China is still a victorious nation, it is not a glorious thing for the United States to feel it necessary to send an investigation mission to China."

However, the traitor Chiang Kai-shek does not feel ashamed; on the contrary, he is putting on all kinds of ugly shows to welcome this foreign aggressor. According to American news agencies, the Chiang Kai-shek clique is "awaiting his arrival with unprecedented seriousness." "Officials of the Chiang government believe that Wedemeyer's arrival is a once-in-a-century opportunity." Chiang Kai-shek mobilized all departments of the Chiang government to draft work reports for his foreign superior. Officials of Chiang's Ministry of Foreign Affairs "held meetings until midnight to discuss the method of reporting." Chiang Kai-shek appointed seven or eight high-ranking officials at the ministerial level as "reporters to Special Envoy Wedemeyer," and also appointed four people to "maintain close contact with Wedemeyer." Among these four people is the American favorite, Sun Li-jen. The reason he is favored is that he is the only one among Chiang Kai-shek's senior military officers who has attended an American military school. Several of Chiang Kai-shek's theater commanders "have also gathered in Nanjing to await Wedemeyer's arrival." On the day Wedemeyer arrived in Nanjing, dozens of Chiang Kai-shek's civil and military officials, including Soong Tzu-wen and Chen Cheng, as well as honor guards, arrived at the airport even earlier than the personnel of the American embassy, waiting for one hour and twenty minutes before receiving the foreign dignitary. Compared to Wang Jingwei's welcoming of the Japanese in the past, Chiang Kai-shek's dog-like behavior is even more vividly displayed this time.

Wedemeyer is equally anxious. He "flew directly to Nanjing" from Guam because he "urgently wanted to meet Chiang Kai-shek." He discovered that Chiang Kai-shek had lost the "initiative" in a year of civil war. According to the United Press, "Without foreign intervention, the Chinese Communists seem likely to achieve complete victory." The Associated Press estimates that Wedemeyer will "first review the situation in Manchuria."

Regarding Wedemeyer's mission to China, the United Press pointed out the day after Wedemeyer's mission was announced that "Wedemeyer's main task in going to China will be to seek ways for the U.S. to help the Chiang Kai-shek government without making useless donations of large sums of money." The Associated Press also said on the same day: "American assistance may be very broad, providing aircraft equipment and other materials to support Nanjing's anti-communist war," "Wedemeyer's visit to China is a preparatory step for implementing the Truman Doctrine in the Far East." Obviously, the purpose of U.S. imperialism in sending Wedemeyer to China is to further help the Chiang bandits fight the civil war, to save the Chiang bandits from extinction, and at the same time attempt to further colonize China and turn China into another Greece.

Although the Chiang Kai-shek traitorous clique hopes that Wedemeyer will provide assistance "openly, directly, and comprehensively," hoping that he will "bring bags of gold to the children like Santa Claus" and "miraculously relieve the pain of inflation," the Shanghai Evening Post & Mercury declared that Wedemeyer "may not bring many gifts to China (referring to the Chiang government). Wedemeyer's main equipment will be a notebook, filled with beautiful handwriting." The Associated Press also revealed the difficulties of the U.S. imperialists, namely: if they were to let go and help Chiang Kai-shek, they would not only encounter the high dissatisfaction and hostility of the American and Chinese people, but also "the Kuomintang's victory over the Communist Party is a distant prospect or almost impossible."

Chiang Kai-shek's demise cannot be saved. The only result Wedemeyer can achieve will be to expose the true face of the U.S.-Chiang clique's destruction of China before the people, while exposing the increasing frailty and isolation of the Chinese and American reactionaries.

The Chinese people have expressed open opposition to Wedemeyer's visit to China. New York Times reporter Will Lee reported that the middle class in the Chiang-controlled areas "expressed serious fear" about Wedemeyer's visit. But the broad masses of the Chinese people have nothing to fear. They not only express resentment and disgust towards the American imperialist Wedemeyer and the traitor Chiang Kai-shek, but also despise them.

### 美蒋日益外强中干  魏德迈来华显示它们很着急  但蒋介石的灭亡已无法换救

    美蒋日益外强中干
    魏德迈来华显示它们很着急
    但蒋介石的灭亡已无法换救
    【新华社陕北三十日电】美帝国主义者魏德迈及其“调查团”自二十二日到达南京，迄今已逾一周。这个“调查团”的到来，乃是中国的耻辱，标志着蒋介石统治下的中国的进一步殖民地化。连大公报都不能不说：“因为中国仍是战胜国，因而让美国觉得必须派调查团到中国来，并不是一件光荣的事。”
    但是卖国贼蒋介石却不以为可耻，反而出现种种丑态，来欢迎这个外国侵略者。据美国通讯社报导：蒋介石集团以“从来未有的严肃情绪等待其来临。”“蒋政府的官员们以为魏德迈之到来，乃是百年难遇的机会。”蒋介石把蒋政府各部门全体动员起来，起草工作报告给他的外国上司。蒋记外交部官员为了“讨论报告的方法，开会至午夜始散。”蒋介石指定了七、八个部长一级的高级官员为“对魏德迈特使的报告人”，还指定了四个人“与魏德迈保持密切联系”。这四个人中，包括了美国人的宠儿孙立人，他之所以得宠，因为他是蒋介石的高级军官中唯一进过美国军事学校的人。蒋介石的几个战区司令“也都齐集南京等候魏德迈的到来”。魏到南京的那天，蒋介石的文武大员宋子文、陈诚等数十人及仪仗队，比美国大使馆人员还更早赶到机场，等了一点二十分才接到了洋大人的驾。比起以前汪精卫迎接日本人来，这次蒋介石的狗态更加表现得淋漓尽致。
    魏德迈也是一样地着急，他到了关岛就“飞迳南京”。因为他“亟欲会晤蒋介石，他发现蒋介石在一年的内战中，已失去了“主动权”。按合众社的说法：“如无外国干涉，中共似很可能完全胜利。”美联社估计，魏德迈将“首先审查满洲形势。”
    关于魏德迈来华使命，合众社在魏使命宣布次日即指出，“魏德迈赴华之主要任务，将在寻求途径，俾美能援助蒋介石政府，而不以大量金钱作无益捐输。”美联社同日也说：“美国的帮助可能甚为广泛，给以飞机装备及其他物资以支持南京反共战争”，“魏氏来华，系在远东贯澈杜鲁门主义的准备步骤。”显然，美帝国主义派魏德迈来中国的目的，就是进一步帮助蒋贼打内战，以挽救蒋贼的灭亡，同时企图进一步把中国殖民地化，使中国变为希腊一样。
    虽然蒋介石卖国集团希望魏德迈“公开地、直接地、全面地”给予援助，希望他“象圣诞老人一样给孩子们带来满袋金子。”“奇迹地解除通货膨胀的痛苦，但是上海大美晚报宣称，魏德迈“未必给中国（指蒋政府‘带来很多礼物，魏德迈）之主要装备，将是笔记薄一本，于其上写满漂亮的字体。”美联社也泄露了美帝国主义者的困难，即是：如果要放手帮助蒋介石，即不但将遇到美国人民与中国人民之高度不满与敌视，而且“国民党欲战胜共产党乃遥遥无期或几乎不可能。”
    蒋介石的灭亡是挽救不了的。魏德迈所能达到的结果，将仅仅是在人民面前暴露美蒋一体灭亡中国的真面目，同时暴露中美反动派的日益外强中干，众叛亲离。
    中国人民对于魏德迈来华，表示了公开反对。纽约时报记者威尔利报导，蒋管区中产阶级对魏来华“表示严重的恐惧。”但广大的中国人民，则无所恐惧。他们对于美国帝国主义者魏德迈与卖国贼蒋介石，不仅表示愤恨与厌恶，而且藐视他们。
