Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 16th. Comprehensive reports: The "Pan-American Mutual Defense Conference," manipulated by the United States, was scheduled to open in Rio de Janeiro, the capital of Brazil, yesterday. The original number of participating countries was twenty-one, but due to Cuba's declaration of temporary non-participation and the non-recognition of the new Nicaraguan regime by most of the participating countries, the actual number of participants may be less than this. The conference will last about half a month. According to the US Information Service, the agenda "only has one item, which is to formulate the principles of the Chapultepec Act of Mutual Assistance, passed in Mexico City in March 1945, into a treaty." This means signing a so-called "common defense agreement," but based on the United States' meticulous arrangements for this conference and its importance, such as US Treasury Secretary Snyder's visit to Brazil before the conference to "inspect," after returning home he expressed that he was "deeply moved" by the richness of Brazil's oil and iron ore reserves. Also, on August 1, the State Department announced the list of a large delegation headed by Marshall, which included well-known reactionaries Vandenberg, US Ambassador to the United Nations Austin, and others. According to reports, the United States will use this conference to intensify its economic expansion into countries such as Brazil, and strive to completely turn South American countries into its satellite states. According to a French News Agency dispatch from Washington, "The US Army, Navy, and State Department believe that general military alliance treaties are useless. The fact that many American countries did not participate in the war with the US after the Pearl Harbor incident proves this. On the contrary, only rapid standardization (i.e., Americanization) of armaments and exchange (i.e., dispatch) of commanders in the Western Hemisphere can make South America obey the United States." The "common defense" clamored by the United States is a trap for the United States to make South American countries "obey the United States." This conference was convened under the pretext of "establishing a barrier against communism" (Connally's words), but according to the Brazilian newspaper Popular Forum, "American countries are deeply fearful of the threat of US monopoly capital to their independence. They suspect whether this Hitler-style movement will hinder the interests of various countries." This shows that the United States' attempt to enslave the Americas will be resolutely opposed by the broad masses of the South American people.

### “泛美联防会议”揭幕　美洲各国深感恐惧

　　“泛美联防会议”揭幕
  　美洲各国深感恐惧
    【新华社陕北十六日电】综合报导：美国操纵下的“泛美联防会议”，定于昨日在巴西京城里约热内卢粉墨揭幕。参加会议者原定二十一国，但因古巴声明暂不参加及尼加拉瓜新政权之尚未为大部与会国家所承认，实际参加者可能不足此数。会议需时约半月，议事日程据美新闻处称：“只有一项，即将一九四五年三月在墨京通过的察晋尔特贝克联防法案之原则，制定为一条约。”意即签订所谓“共同防卫协定”，但根据美国对此次会议的周密布置及其重视，如美财长史奈德在会议前夕曾去巴西“考察”，回国后即对巴西石油和铁矿蕴藏的丰富表示“深受感动”。又如八月一日，国务院宣布以马歇尔为首的庞大代表团的名单，其中包括著名反动派范登堡、美出席联合国代表奥斯汀等人。据息美国将借此会议加紧对巴西等国的经济扩张，且力图把南美各国完全变成其卫星国。据法国新闻社华府电称：“美陆海军部及国务院认为，一般的军事同盟公约并无用处。珍珠港事变后，许多美洲国家并未随美参战，便是证明。它们相反，只有西半球军备很快标准化（即美国化）和交换（即美国派遣）指挥官，才能使南美均听从美国”。美国所叫嚣的“共同防卫”乃是美国要南美各国“唯美国之命是从”的圈套。此次会议是在“设立防范共产主义屏障”（康纳利语）的借口下召开，但据巴西大众论坛报透露：“美洲各国对美国独占资本对它们独立的威胁，已深感恐惧。它们怀疑这希特勒式的运动是否会妨碍各国的利益”。此显示美国奴役美洲之企图，势将遭到南美广大人民的坚决反对。
