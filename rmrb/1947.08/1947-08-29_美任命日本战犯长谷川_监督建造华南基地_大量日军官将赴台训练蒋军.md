　　Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 27th. A TASS dispatch from Nanjing on the 26th reports: The Hong Kong Hua Shang Pao published a Taipei dispatch, citing a high-ranking Kuomintang official in Taiwan as saying: Former Japanese Governor-General of Taiwan, Hasegawa, has actually been appointed by the United States to supervise the construction of naval and air force bases along the South China coast, including Hainan Island, Fujian Province, and Taiwan. The official said: "Hasegawa is nominally the head of the Japanese Immigrant Group, responsible for studying Japanese immigrants in Taiwan, but in reality, he is supervising the construction of these naval and air force bases. When the Sino-Japanese War broke out, Hasegawa was the commander of the Japanese Third Fleet, specially used for the invasion of China, and was extremely familiar with the South China Sea. During the war, he was the Japanese Governor-General of Taiwan, and all the naval and air force facilities in Taiwan were planned and built under his direction. Therefore, the United States believes that he is fully competent for this position, which explains why Hasegawa has not been summoned as a war criminal to this day." The official also said: "Because the United States plans to train 600,000 Chinese troops (referring to Chiang's army) in Taiwan, a large number of Japanese will come to Taiwan as instructors in the future. Most Taiwanese youths do not understand English or Mandarin, so they can only be trained in Japanese, so Japanese officers are needed. Several Japanese officers have already arrived in Taiwan, and the rest are expected to arrive before the end of the year."

　　美任命日本战犯长谷川
    监督建造华南基地
    大量日军官将赴台训练蒋军
    【新华社陕北二十七日电】据塔斯社南京二十六日电：香港华商报发表台北消息，据台湾某国民党高级人员称：前日本台湾总督长谷川实际上已被美国任命为华南沿海海空军基地建筑事宜的监督者，海南岛、福建省、台湾等地皆在内。该官员称：“长谷川名义上是日本移民团长，负研究台湾日本移民之责，但实际是监督这些海空军基地的建筑。中日战争爆发时，长谷川为日本专任侵华所用的第三舰队司令，对南中国海极为熟悉。战时为日本台湾总督，台湾的全部海空军设备，都是在他的主持下计划建造的。因此美国认为他完全胜任此职，这便说明了为什么到今日长谷川尚未作为战犯传讯的原因。”该官员并称：“因为美国拟在台湾训练六十万中国军队（指蒋军），今后将有大量的日人来台湾当教官，大多数台湾青年既不懂英语，也不懂国语，所以只能用日语来训练，故需要日本军官。若干日本军官业已到了台湾，其余的可望于年底前到达”。
