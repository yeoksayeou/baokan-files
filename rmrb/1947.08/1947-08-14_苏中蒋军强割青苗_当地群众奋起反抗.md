Xinhua News Agency, Central China, 12th. A wave of anger against the Kuomintang puppet regime's forced cutting of seedlings has once again surged in the Kuomintang-controlled areas of Central Jiangsu. Since July, the plains of Central Jiangsu have been covered in tall sorghum and corn, growing taller than people, with large ears and plump kernels, promising a rich harvest. However, the Kuomintang puppets, fearing attacks by the Liberated Area's military and civilians, organized "seedling cutting teams" to force farmers to cut down all the sorghum and corn on both sides of the roads surrounding the Kuomintang strongholds, leaving millions of people without food. According to incomplete statistics, in Rugao, Haimen, and Qidong counties alone, over 20,000 mu of autumn crops were cut. Those who refused to cut the seedlings were brutally murdered, and many women were made into "stone rollers" (stone rollers are farm implements used for rolling and compacting land) under the bayonets, rolled on corn stalks until they were covered in blood, their veins bulging, and their minds confused. Millions of people, forced to seek survival, launched a struggle against the forced cutting of seedlings. In Rugao, over 10,000 people from more than 20 townships demonstrated twice, carrying hoes, beating gongs and drums, setting off firecrackers, and lighting torches. The demonstration procession was like a fire dragon, traveling through dozens of villages, marching powerfully towards the Kuomintang puppet strongholds. Along the way, they shouted slogans: "The field is our root, food is our life, only by protecting the autumn crops can we survive," "Thousands of hoes and tens of thousands of pitchforks, whoever cuts the seedlings, send them back to their hometown." The Kuomintang puppets were so frightened that they shrank into their tortoise shells and dared not poke their heads out. In the suburbs of Rugao, people from seven townships even held the autumn crops cut down by the Kuomintang puppets and rushed through layers of police obstruction, heading straight for Rugao County, questioning the Kuomintang magistrate. The Kuomintang magistrate could not escape and had to repeatedly promise, "There will be no more cutting next time." In the struggle, thirty-four young people from the seventh district joined the militia, and the Kuomintang puppets who went to the countryside to cut seedlings were often driven away by the people with pitchforks and hoes. On the Hai'an-Qi'cha line, seven townships near Libao simply leveled seven Kuomintang puppet bunkers, destroyed the local Kuomintang regime, and protected the autumn crops.

　　苏中蒋军强割青苗
  　当地群众奋起反抗
    【新华社华中十二日电】反抗蒋伪割青怒潮又在苏中蒋后掀起。七月以来苏中平原一片砦野高粱、玉米长过人头，穗大子肥，丰收在望。但蒋伪因恐惧解放区军民袭击，乃组织“割青队”强迫农民将蒋军据点周围公路两侧高粱、玉米扫数砍光，使千万人民绝粮。据不完全统计，仅如皋、海门、启东三县即被割秋禾达两万余亩。不愿割青者惨遭杀戮，许多妇女在刺刀下作了“肉石磊”（石磊是农具、作碾压土地用），在玉米杆上滚压至满身鲜血，青筋暴涨，神志昏迷。千万人民被迫求命掀起反割青斗争，如皋二十余乡万余人民两次示威，扛起锄头、敲起锣鼓，放鞭炮，点火把，示威行列宛如火龙，穿行数十村庄，浩浩荡荡直迫蒋伪据点，沿途并高呼口号“田是根，粮是命，保住秋禾才有命”，“千把锄头万把叉，那个割青送他回老家”，吓得蒋伪缩在乌龟壳里不敢探头。如皋城郊七乡人民并手持蒋伪割下之秋禾，冲过重重警察阻拦，直奔如皋县城，责问蒋记县长，蒋县长躲避不及只得连声答应“下次不再割了。”在斗争中七区三十四个青年参加民兵，下乡割青的蒋伪，经常被人民用钉钯锄头逐走。海（安）祺（茶）线上李堡附近七乡并干脆将蒋伪七座碉堡平毁，摧垮当地蒋政权，保住了秋禾。
