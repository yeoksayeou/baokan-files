Ping Shun Second District Labor Heroes and Skilled Workers Study Techniques
Lead the Masses to Cut Artemisia and沤Fertilize

[This newspaper's Ping Shun dispatch] The Second District launched a fertilizer accumulation campaign. Because of the drought this spring, the artemisia didn't grow well, so the masses lost confidence in accumulating fertilizer. For example, Liu Shengxue from Xigou Village said, "There's no way to accumulate fertilizer this year." Then Zhang Faqun said, "The grass hasn't even grown this year, so how can we make fertilizer?" This shows that there are major obstacles in the masses' thinking about accumulating fertilizer. In order to break the masses' idea that they couldn't accumulate fertilizer, a meeting of eighteen heroes and skilled fertilizer technicians was held in the district on the 29th of last month, lasting two days. First, a discussion was held to research the following methods of accumulating fertilizer: (1) Cutting artemisia grass, scraping hairy grass, and gathering tree leaves. (2) Scraping wall plaster and knocking down kang (heated brick bed). (3) Accumulating ash fertilizer and sweeping dust (from the tops of beams). (4) Fertilizing uncultivated land and stubble, as well as fertilizing with bone meal. (5) Sweeping streets, courtyards, and millstone paths. (6) Picking up cattle and donkey manure and pouring it into pens and toilets. (7) Organizing sheep to lie on the ground and stay in pens, and when the sheep don't enter the pens when it rains, standing on the slopes at night to scrape sheep manure. (8) Chaffing corn stalks and frequently padding the pen soil. (9) Digging hair pits and沤fertilizer pits. (10) Completely pouring the water from washing clothes into the toilet for沤fertilizing, as well as large and small sesame cake fertilizer. After research, Shen Qixing said, "Ash fertilizer and dust are good fertilizers. I applied more than twenty loads to a piece of land, and now it has also killed the insects. Even though it hasn't been fertilized for three years, the corn is still growing very well." Li Qiugui said, "As long as you are diligent in accumulating fertilizer, I passed by the river the other day and collected twenty loads of river杂fertilizer in half a day." Li Shunda said, "The best way to accumulate fertilizer is to build toilets and沤fertilizer ditches. I will definitely build a ditch and a toilet when I get back. As the saying goes: accumulating fertilizer is like accumulating gold. If you want the land to be strong, knock down the kang every two to three years." With the fertilizer accumulation methods in place, everyone's confidence in accumulating fertilizer has been improved, and they all said, "As long as we are diligent, accumulating fertilizer is not a problem!" It was also pointed out that it is not enough to just make fertilizer without improving the quality. After everyone's research, there are the following points to improve: (1) The cattle and donkey manure that is picked up cannot be applied directly to the land (if it is applied to the land, it will attract insects, and the donkey will have no energy). The pen manure must be well沤. (2) Make fertilizer diligently, turn the manure three times and it will rot naturally. Cattle, donkey, and sheep manure should be hoed and turned frequently so that the fertilizer can be well沤. (3) Kang soil, wall plaster ash feet, and dust fertilizer cannot be exposed to rain (if exposed to rain, the power will be gone, and the strength will be small). (4) Corn stalks and artemisia fertilizer should be added gradually, because it is wet and can be combined with the soil to沤fertilize, which is very strong. After collectively researching the technology, everyone discussed it, and Li Shuangk said, "If it weren't for this research, I wouldn't know these techniques, and I would have a way to accumulate fertilizer when I return to the village." Li Shunda said, "If you want to make a fuss, you must grasp the timing of the season," and everyone agreed that Shunda was right. According to the situation: First, cut artemisia grass, scrape hairy grass, build toilets, and build ditches from the second half of June (lunar calendar) to July. Second, after the autumn harvest, cut corn stalks, gather杂,刨stubble熏fertilizer, and make sesame cakes as fertilizer. Third, knock down the kang and創wall plaster in the spring, and open up wasteland熏fertilizer. Fourth, in the regular stage, pick up fertilizer, sweep the streets and courtyards, frequently pad the pens, accumulate ash fertilizer, wash clothes water, and bone fertilizer. Everyone said that this time they can lead well when they go back, and they must always promote the whole village to make fertilizer. At this time, in order to further improve everyone's fertilizer accumulation goal, the leaders proposed: How much gold do we want to accumulate in the fertilizer accumulation campaign? This inspired everyone's emotions, and Li Shunda took the lead and said the plan: I have two laborers, forty-seven sheep, twelve pigs, two animals, and I will build a toilet and an沤fertilizer ditch. When planting next year, I can accumulate 1,000 loads of sheep fertilizer, cut 50 bundles of artemisia, chop 10 bundles of corn stalks,沤100 loads of fertilizer, accumulate 300 loads of pig fertilizer, accumulate 500 loads of pen fertilizer, 100 loads of圊fertilizer (bud fertilizer), 200 loads of杂fertilizer, and 300 loads of wasteland fertilizer, a total of 2,500 loads of fertilizer, totaling 20 acres of flat land and 5 acres of slope land, with an average of 100 loads of fertilizer per acre to ensure that it is done. Under his positive influence, the hearts of everyone in the audience were moved, and they began to enthusiastically discuss their own fertilizer accumulation plans, and all made their own gold accumulation plans. Li Shunda and other six households guaranteed to apply more than 100 loads of fertilizer per acre, Han Xinfu and other four households guaranteed to apply more than 80 loads, three households guaranteed to apply more than 70 loads, three households guaranteed to apply more than 60 loads, one household guaranteed to apply more than 50 loads, and one household guaranteed to apply more than 35 loads. After establishing the gold accumulation goals, the leaders inspired everyone to act as locomotives, and proposed: How to help the masses accumulate gold, everyone agreed to go back to the village to patiently persuade the members of the masses, organize the masses to visit the land, use the comparison of the quality of crops to open up the masses' minds, and take the lead in taking the lead to influence the masses and help the masses make plans. It is necessary to study how many households can be helped according to each person's ability. Li Shunda said, "I will go back to lead all 58 households in the village to actively make fertilizer, and ensure that each acre of land in the village will be fertilized with more than 60 loads next year." Wang Songze said, "I will promote all 11 households in my group," and Zhang Youze guaranteed to mobilize all 21 households in his team. After this competition, the emotions were even higher, and everyone excitedly returned to the village to actually organize the masses and carry out the campaign. (Shuanghong, Jianxian)

[This newspaper's Licheng dispatch] The Second District's Tinghe was透rainy. Taking advantage of the wet gaps in the ground, the method of accumulating fertilizer was discussed. After the land reform, farmers got land to plant, but lacked fertilizer. Therefore, on the 27th, 17 households with little or no fertilizer were convened to study. After discussion, it was unanimously agreed that soaking water沤fertilizer, Dao soil, wheat bran, and pen fertilizer are the three major categories, which are labor-saving and quick沤. Wang Qin said: "It is not possible to farm without fertilizer, and it is not possible to do business without capital." Liu Shengfa, an old man in his fifties,沤manure in the rain. Zhao Zhirui said: "Although the rain has落透, the harvest has been reduced. Planting autumn vegetables has already occupied the wheat fields. Harvesting autumn and planting wheat requires more fertilizer." After this discussion, Wang Qin and other 17 people, in one day沤fertilized 1,526驮. Under his influence, the whole village沤fertilized a total of 3,020驮, which can solve the fertilizer difficulties for more than 100 acres of land after autumn planting (30驮per acre).

    平顺二区劳英能手研究技术
    领导群众割蒿沤粪
    【本报平顺讯】二区开展积肥运动。由于今春天旱，蒿都普遍没长起来，因此群众都失掉了积肥信心，如西沟村刘生学说：“今年想积肥也没法”，接着张发群说：“今年草都没有长起来，还怎样造肥啦。”从此说明群众是对积肥思想上是存在极大障碍。为了打破群众积不上肥思想，特于上月二十九日在区召开英雄、积肥技术能手共十八人会议，会期是两天，首先座谈，研究出以下几种积肥办法：（一）割蒿草、刮毛草、搂树叶。（二）创墙皮、打炕。（三）积灰肥、扫尘灰（梁头）。（四）熏荒肥、茬熏肥（玉茭茬）、熏骨肥，（五）打扫街、院、碾磨道。（六）拾牛驴肥往圈及厕所内倒。（七）组织羊卧地住圈，到下雨羊不进圈时到坡上站夜刮羊荒肥。（八）铡玉茭秆、勤垫圈土。（九）打毛坑、打沤肥坑。（十）洗衣服水完全倒往厕所内沤肥，及大小麻饼肥。经研究后，申起兴说：“灰肥尘灰是好肥，我有一块地上了二十余担，现把虫也毒死，三年没上肥还是长的玉茭特别好”。李秋贵说：“积肥只要勤，我那天从河边过，半天功夫捞了二十担河圪杂肥。”李顺达说：“论积肥好还是打厕所，打沤肥圪道，我回去总要打一个圪道，一个厕所。俗话说：积肥如积金，要想地里壮，三年两打炕。”积肥办法有了，都提高了积肥信心，都说：“只要勤紧，积肥不成问题！”又提出只造肥不提高质量还不算，经过大家研究，有以下几点提高办法：（一）拾上牛、驴肥不能生往地内上（如上到地生虫，肥驴没劲），圈肥都要经过沤好。（二）勤做造肥，粪翻三遍自烂，牛、驴、羊粪要勤使镢刨，勤翻就能把肥沤好。（三）炕土、墙皮灰脚、尘肥都不能见雨（见雨力气冒了，劲小）。（四）玉茭秆蒿肥要随着随着，因他本身是湿的，能和土结合沤起肥很壮。经集体把技术研究后，大家纷纷议论，李双科说：“要不是这样研究，我就不知道这些技术，回村积肥有了办法啦。”李顺达说：“要把闹上，总得把时间季节掌握好”，都一致认为顺达说的很对。根据情况：一、在六月（阴历）后半月到七月这一段割蒿草，刮毛草，打厕所，打圪道。二、秋收后割玉茭秆，搂圪杂，刨茬子薰肥，打油煎饼做肥。三、春天打炕创墙皮，开荒熏肥。四、在经常阶段，拾肥、打扫街院、勤垫圈、积灰肥、洗衣水、骨肥等。都说这次回去可要好领导啦，要经常推动全村闹肥。这时领导上为了更进一步提高大家的积肥目标，即提出：咱们在积肥运动中要积多少金？启发了大家情绪，李顺达首打头炮说计划：我有劳力两个，有羊四十七个，猪十二个，牲口两头，再打一个厕所，打一个沤肥圪道，到下年种地时能积羊肥一千担，割蒿五十捆，铡十捆玉茭秆，能沤肥一百担，猪肥积三百担，圈肥能积五百担，圊肥（芽肥）一百担，杂肥圪积二百担，荒肥积三百担，共积肥二千五百担，共平地二十亩，坡地五亩，平均每亩上肥一百担，保证做到。在他积极影响下，引起了全场人心动，便开始热火朝天的讨论自己积肥计划，都订出了自己的积金计划，每亩保证上肥一百担以上的有李顺达等六户，上八十担以上的有韩新福等四户，上七十担以上的有三户，上六十担以上的有三户，上五十担以上的一户，上三十五担以上的一户。都树立了积金目标后，领导上启发大家下去起火车头作用，即提出：怎样来帮助群众积金，一致说回村向群众耐心说服会员，组织群众到地参观，用对比庄稼好坏打通群众思想，自己首先动手带头，影响群众，帮助群众订计划。要根据各人能力研究出自己能帮助几户，李顺达说：“我回去领导全村五十八户都积极闹肥，保证全村下年每亩地上到六十担肥以上。”王松则说：“我回去把全组十一户推动起来”，张有则保证把他队二十一户都动员起来。经这样比赛，情绪更高，都兴奋的回村去实际组织群众，开展运动。（双红、见贤）
    【本报黎城讯】二区停河透雨，利用地湿空隙，讨论积肥办法。经过土地改革，农民得到地种，但缺乏肥料，因此于廿七日召开肥少没肥的户十七人来研究。经讨论后一致认为浸水好沤肥、道土、麦糠、圈肥三大类又省力又快沤。王芹说：“种地没肥，做买卖没本是不行”。五十余岁的老汉刘生法在雨中沤粪，赵支瑞说：“天虽落了透雨，收成是减成啦，撒秋菜已把麦地占去，割秋种麦要多上肥”。经这一讨论后，王芹等十七人，一天沤肥一千五百二十六驮都在他影响下，全村共沤肥三千零二十驮，能解决秋后种麦（每亩三十驮）一百余亩地的肥料困难。（停河铺通讯组守贤、锐文、仁贵）
