　　After the Military Region Headquarters Launched a Merit Campaign
    The Work of the 机关 Took on a New Look
  　A Merit Celebration Meeting Was Held to Summarize the Experience of Earning Merits
    [Special Dispatch from this Newspaper] The Headquarters of the Jin-Ji-Lu-Yu Military Region solemnly held a merit celebration meeting for personnel who had earned merits in the headquarters on August 22nd. In addition to all cadres and miscellaneous personnel of the headquarters, representatives from other nearby 机关 were also specially invited to participate in the celebration. At the meeting, merit-earning personnel were presented with flowers and awarded badges with Chairman Mao's portrait, receiving unparalleled honor and respect.
    At the meeting, Director Yang summarized the experience of the merit campaign over the past six months. He said: The merit campaign at the headquarters started in February and has been going on for a full six months until August, and the campaign has become more in-depth and vigorous day by day. During these six months, many people have earned merits, breaking the notion that "merits can be earned on the front line, but people in remote corners of the rear cannot earn merits." The appearance of the 机关 has been completely renewed, and everyone is full of vigor. Work efficiency has been unprecedentedly improved, and model examples are everywhere. For example, comrades in the Cipher Room used to stop working after office hours, but now they translate reports as soon as they arrive, and they would rather not take a nap than delay today's telegrams until tomorrow. Moreover, they repeatedly proofread, greatly reducing errors. Comrades in the Operations Department usually organize various materials in an orderly manner, and can send them to the leaders immediately whenever they are needed. They are also more proactive in dealing with problems, putting forward positive suggestions to the leaders. Comrades in the Cartography Section can write 2mm square characters when necessary (generally they only write 5mm characters), with horizontal and vertical strokes straight and clear. The writing speed has increased from 1,200 characters per ten hours to 1,600 characters. In the past, it took 70 hours to draw a standard map, but now it only takes 40 hours. Comrade Liu Xinli, a sergeant in the Management Section, goes to distant places to buy vegetables, buys good ones, saves money, and helps the kitchen carry water when he comes back. The relationship between departments, between cadres, and between superiors and subordinates has become closer and more united. They cooperate with each other in work and talk to each other when they have opinions, without holding grudges. Under the specific and patient help of the superiors, the subordinates learn from the superiors with an open mind. Everyone, regardless of department, feels relaxed; political life is also unprecedentedly intense, and political interest has become more intense. In the past, the time spent waiting for meetings was longer than the meeting time, but now everyone can arrive quickly when a meeting is announced. With interest in learning, organizational life has also become more rigorous.
    Director Yang summarized several basic experiences for achieving the above results: First, clarify the idea of earning merits and continuously conduct merit education. At the beginning, when calling on everyone to earn merits, the slogan "Everyone earns merits, and add merits to merits" was put forward, but everyone had some concerns about earning merits. The general reaction was: we can't do it, cadres can earn merits, but soldiers can't; merits can be earned on the front line, but we are people in remote corners and cannot earn merits, and so on. After June, the leadership put forward that "Everyone earns merits" is an action slogan, the more people who earn merits, the better, earning merits is directly supporting the front line, and the faster and sooner Chiang Kai-shek will be defeated. After clarifying the idea of earning merits and continuously conducting education, the merit campaign was launched. Second, move from small to large, from individual units to the whole. The headquarters first started with the Troop Affairs Section, reporting and pursuing merits one by one. Do a good job in one section, set a typical example, and promote everyone. Third, the leaders are responsible, take action personally, and the administration closely cooperates with the Party; if the leaders only stand in the position of calling and sponsoring, the campaign will not be successful. When the headquarters was carrying out the merit campaign, Deputy Commander Teng personally understood the situation of the Troop Affairs Section and introduced Comrade Liao Jiamin, the section chief of the section, to everyone, which greatly encouraged everyone. Only with the leadership of the Party, without cooperation with the administration, it will fall into emptiness and not be practical. Only with the administration, without the cooperation of the Party, ideological leadership will be relaxed. Fourth, merit evaluation must be done through the masses, and cannot be satisfied with raising hands to vote; because there are many 机关 departments, it is not easy to understand, the merits of each comrade should be printed out for everyone to evaluate in detail, put forward opinions, and score points, and then synthesize everyone's opinions. Doing so not only achieves fairness, but also allows everyone to learn from each other's strengths, be wary of weaknesses, and educate everyone. The leadership must always pay attention to the opinions below, and must patiently study the reasons for every move and every stillness, and strive to be fair. Fifth, merit evaluation is based on business standards and cannot be limited to daily life. There are many unsung heroes in the 机关, such as comrades in the Cipher Room who work on codes every day, which is not easy for others to understand, so the size of the merits must be measured according to the job and individual conditions.

### 军区司令部开展立功运动后  机关工作焕然一新　召开贺功大会总结立功经验

　　军区司令部开展立功运动后
    机关工作焕然一新
  　召开贺功大会总结立功经验
    【本报特讯】晋冀鲁豫军区司令部于八月二十二日隆重举行为本机关立功人员贺功大会，到会者除司令部全体干部及杂务人员外，附近其他机关亦特派代表参加庆贺。大会特为立功人员挂花，并授予毛主席肖像奖章，受到无上荣誉与尊敬。
    大会由杨处长总结半年以来立功运动经验。他说：司令部立功运动从二月开始，到八月已整整半年，运动一天比一天深入、高涨。在这半年当中，许多人都立了功，打破了“前线上能立功，后方角落里的人不能立功”的说法，机关面貌一新，人人充满着朝气。工作效率空前提高，模范事例，到处都是。如：机要室同志，过去一过办公时间往往就不办公，现在做到啥时来报啥时译，宁愿不睡午觉，也绝不把今天的电报押到明天。而且反复校对，错字大大减少。参谋处同志平时将各种材料整理得井井有条，首长啥时候要材料马上即可送去。对于问题处理，更能主动，向首长提出积极意见。制图科同志，必要时能写二米厘的方体字（一般只写五米厘），横平竖直，字迹清楚。写字由每十小时一千二百字增加到一千六。过去七十小时画一张标准图，现在只用四十小时。管理科上士刘新礼同志，买菜到远地方去买，买好的，又省钱，回来还帮助厨房担水。各部门关系，干部之间，上下之间，更加亲密团结，有工作时互相配合，有意见时互相谈心，不结圪。上级具体耐心的帮助下级，下级虚心学习上级。不论部门人都感到轻松；政治生活也空前紧张，政治兴趣更加浓厚起来。过去等候开会的时间比开会时间还长，现在一说开会，都能迅速到齐。学习有了兴趣，组织生活也更严格起来。
    所以获得以上成绩，杨处长扼要的总结出几个基本经验：一、明确立功思想，不断进行立功教育。开始号召大家立功时，提出“人人立功，功上加功”口号，但大家对立功有所顾虑，普遍反映：咱不行，干部可立功，战士不行；前方可立功，咱是角落里的人不能立功等等。六月以后，领导上提出“人人立功”是行动口号，立功的人越多越好，立了功就是直接支援了前线，打垮蒋介石就越快越早，明确了立功思想，不断进行教育，立功运动才轰开。二、由小动到大动，由各个单位到全体。司令部先从队务科着手，报功追功，一个一个的来。搞好一科，典型示范，推动大家。三、首长负责，亲自动手，行政与党密切配合；首长只站在号召赞助地位，运动就搞不起来。司令部搞立功运动时，滕副司令员亲自了解队务科情形，将该科科长廖家岷同志的功劳向大家介绍，对大家鼓舞作用很大。只有党的领导，不与行政配合，即会陷于空洞，不切工作实际。只有行政，没有党的配合，思想领导即会放松。四、评功必须经过群众，不能满足于举手表决；因为机关部门繁多，不易了解，应把每个同志的功绩印出来，让大家详细评判，提意见，打分数，然后把大家意见综合起来。这样做，既做到了公平，又能大家互相学习长处，警惕缺点，教育了大家。领导上必须时刻注意下边意见，一动一静，必须耐心研究原因，尽力做到公平。五、评功以业务为标准，不能限于日常生活。机关内无名英雄很多，如机要室同志每天弄电码，不易被别人了解，因此须按岗位工作及个人条件衡量功绩大小。
