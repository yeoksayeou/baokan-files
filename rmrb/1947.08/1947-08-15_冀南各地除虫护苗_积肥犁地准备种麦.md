　　Jinan Various Places Remove Insects to Protect Seedlings
　　Accumulate Fertilizer and Plow Land to Prepare for Wheat Planting
　　[Our Newspaper Jinan, 12th Dispatch] The masses in various places are seizing the gaps in weeding seedlings to accumulate fertilizer and plow the land, actively preparing for wheat planting. The Xu Chengzhong mutual aid team in Nanguan, Yaoshan, is plowing the land while weeding. The team has a total of 101 mu of wheat land and four donkeys, and plowed 25 mu in two days. The Zhou Ronghua brigade in Xiangchenggu, Qiu County, is actively shoveling grass, sweeping soil, and composting manure, estimating that they can compost nine cartloads by the time of wheat planting. Six livestock are accumulating 18 cartloads, and three pigs are accumulating five large cartloads of fertilizer. Originally, they planned to plant 25 mu of wheat, but now they have decided to plant 10 mu of sorghum stubble as well. Sun Mixiang and Sun Baotian, and other four households in Kanggong Village, Fourth District of Yuanchao, used their sideline income to jointly buy cattle for wheat planting. Sun Mi divided 7 mu of wheat land, and has now accumulated eight cartloads of manure, and is also preparing 200 jin of rapeseed cake, all to be applied to the wheat land. In Songshigu, 19 mutual aid teams accumulated 160 more cartloads of fertilizer in April and May than in the past. In Weixian, the autumn seedlings in various villages in the First District and Shengfotang in the Fifth District have been weeded four times, and they are now actively accumulating fertilizer and engaging in sideline occupations. A mutual aid team in Beiguan sweeps street soil every day, and picks up manure at markets, livestock troughs, and roads. In less than a month, they have collected enough fertilizer for forty large carts. The masses in Miaoshuizhai are accumulating a large amount of fertilizer, preparing to apply 30% more fertilizer than in previous years when planting wheat. Under the slogan of "One more cart of manure, one more dou of grain," the manure pits of 15 mutual aid teams in Ganjizhen can accumulate 35 cartloads of fertilizer. In the afternoon, each person pulls a bundle of grass, and during breaks, they sweep the edges of the field, shovel green grass, and sweep soil and wheat chaff. The Wang Guangqun team uses the landlord's manure pit, sweeping pagoda tree flowers, picking hemp leaves, artemisia, and fallen house soil into the manure pit, carrying 77 loads of water in one day.
　　[Our Newspaper Jinan, 13th Dispatch] In order to protect late seedlings, various places in Jinan have launched a pest elimination campaign. According to statistics from eight counties including Jingxian, Julu, Hengshui, Qizhi, Wucheng, Qinghe, and Guangzong, 180,000 grub worms, 600,000 jin of mole crickets, 30,000 sparrows, more than 10,000 cutworms, and more than 3,000 jin of locust nymphs were caught. In Jingxian, late seedlings were replanted six times, and all were eaten. Some people said, "This is a natural disaster, it is useless to catch them." The leadership seized on this point, promptly carried out anti-superstition education, and mobilized all men and women in the county. In the Third and Fourth Districts alone, more than 80,000 grub worms were caught in three days, and all the autumn seedlings were protected. Julu combined pest elimination with weeding, and in the Second District, 30,000 grub worms were caught in three afternoons. Nearly 10,000 were caught in two days in the Sixth District of Jixian. Women and children in Hengshui flushed out more than 30,000 grub worms in two days. Women and children in the Third and Sixth Districts organized water-carrying teams and reconnaissance teams, and flushed out more than 10,000 in two days. In Beizengzhuang, they were also boiled into oil for lamps, each yielding two liang, saving the whole village money on lamp oil. Women and children in the Fourth District of Wucheng launched a large competition to catch mole crickets, catching more than 60,000 jin in four days. Dafu and Houtun won model awards at the comparison conference. In Xihonghe Village, Qinghe, men made a surprise attack to weed seedlings, while women, children, and the elderly killed mole crickets, catching more than 10,000 in two days, and more than 10,000 cutworms. In Guangzong, the autumn seedlings in the Third District are flourishing, the grain has sprouted, and the sorghum is being dried. In order to prevent sparrows from damaging the crops, more than 30 villages have launched a sparrow catching campaign, catching more than 30,000 in five days, which can yield at least 150,000 jin more grain. In the Chengguan District of Qizhi, 3,000 farmers exterminated more than 3,000 jin of locusts in ten days, saving more than 30,000 mu of autumn seedlings from major damage. The pest elimination campaign is still being carried out in various counties.
