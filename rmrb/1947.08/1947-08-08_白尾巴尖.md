　　Zengfu was a notorious "stubborn mule" in the village, with an arrogant and bad temper. No matter who he was with, if he wasn't happy, he'd speak his mind without restraint. Therefore, the villagers knew he was a troublemaker and avoided him, not wanting to deal with him.

　　Before the incident, Zengfu was considered somewhat well-off, but due to his gluttony and laziness, his life gradually declined. During the famine years, he couldn't make ends meet and sold his house and land for a pittance. His wife and children couldn't fill their stomachs, so he sent them back to his wife's family, leaving Zengfu and his mother at home. Neither could support the other, so they separated. Although they survived the famine years, the whole family was emaciated and looked like skin and bones.

　　In 1943, when the Land Law was issued, Zengfu felt that the poor had a way out again. Smiling, he repeatedly went to the village chief. The village chief said, "Good! Don't rush! The government's decree is to take care of the basic masses. Since you are an impoverished household, you will definitely be able to redeem everything." Zengfu waited and waited, and in the autumn, he indeed redeemed his house and thirteen mu of land, with crops in the fields. Calculating everything, he managed to harvest five cloth bags of grain, seven hundred jin of sweet potatoes, and more than one hundred jin of cotton. With food and clothing, his life, though not extravagant, was comfortable enough. So he called his wife and children back, and the family was reunited.

　　Once the pain was gone, the lesson was forgotten. Zengfu remained gluttonous and lazy. Although he knew the horror of hunger during the famine years, he forgot it once things passed. He didn't want to eat regular cornbread, and insisted on "improving" his meals, buying a fruit bun to change his taste. If the man ate and the wife didn't, it wasn't right; if the adults ate and the children watched, it was also no good. Eating became a family affair.

　　He didn't want to work when the fields were busy, didn't want to work when he was tired, and wouldn't work when he wasn't happy. Once he started chasing rabbits, he abandoned everything else. While other people's crops were thriving, Zengfu's fields were a green blur, indistinguishable between grass and seedlings. When people sat together to chat, they would advise him, "You have to work hard now that you've redeemed your land! Don't let Chairman Mao's good intentions go to waste." Zengfu listened with one ear and let it out the other, even making witty remarks: "Big grass provides shade, small grass keeps me company. If it still doesn't grow well, then something's really wrong." Seeing that he was as stubborn as a date wood knot, those advising him stopped wasting their breath.

　　In 1945, nearby villages were engaged in struggle meetings, and Weizhuang also began to stir. A farmers' association was established and a director was elected. Everyone felt that Zengfu was also a member of the basic masses and should be allowed to join. They sent someone to sound him out, but they were rebuffed. Zengfu said, "I won't do this conscience-pricking thing of struggling against people for no reason. It's just a bunch of poor mountain rabbits in a frenzy!"

　　When these words were relayed, the members were furious. Some said: If he has a conscience, he should return the house and land he redeemed. Others said: Before cursing people, we should struggle against him… After much back and forth, they decided to first try to persuade him with reason, and if that didn't work, they would resort to other methods. So the director led thirteen group leaders to find Zengfu. They first explained the reasons for standing up, and then told him that the masses were not satisfied with him. Seeing that the situation wasn't right, Zengfu, unwilling to join the farmers' association, had to reluctantly agree.

　　During the struggle, Zengfu often went to the home of his old Uncle Ji (the person being struggled against). The person being struggled against knew everything about the farmers' association and even who said what. Everyone thought that no one else but Zengfu could be leaking information. He was criticized at the group meetings, but he maintained a "dynamic attitude" and stubbornly refused to admit anything.

　　After the mass movement passed, it was time to develop the militia. Almost all the younger people in the village were apprentices at the Fengtian Jewelry Store. Zengfu, at thirty-six or seven, wasn't too old, relatively speaking. The captain mobilized him, and Zengfu said, "I won't do that!" The captain asked, "Who did you get to redeem your house and land and share the fruits of victory (two thousand yuan) from?" Zengfu said, "Not from you, from the government's orders!" He meant that it was a matter of course and there was nothing to be grateful for. "Just government orders won't do, the government needs protection!" The captain was quite eloquent and persuaded Zengfu to the point where he had nothing to say and agreed to participate.

　　Zengfu was not happy about being in the militia. He never went to meetings and certainly didn't stand guard at night. When the team sent someone to call him, he had his wife answer that he was "not at home." The caller knew he was pretending and searched the house. Zengfu then cursed impolitely, "Who has the damn time for this! I'm not going! You can expel me!"

　　Everyone knew he was difficult to deal with, so from then on, he just had an empty name in the militia team, and they didn't bother him with anything.

　　Last December, the whole county launched a large-scale review of the land reform. Land reform teams went to the countryside in batches, and Weizhuang was like a calm pond with a large stone thrown into it, causing ripples.

　　After investigating in the village, the land reform team learned that the previous struggle was not good: the masses had not vented their grievances, the landlords had not been eliminated and defeated, the fruits of victory had not been distributed fairly, only the cadres had turned over, and the basic masses were still in the mire… Based on the above situation, this time they would thoroughly carry it out, to truly realize "land to the tiller," to let the masses vent their anger and completely turn over.

　　When the landlords heard this news, it was like a bolt from the blue, not knowing what would happen, and they trembled with fear. Old Ji secretly called Zengfu to his house and said, "Young man! You know this struggle is going to be even more intense! Anyway, I'm afraid I won't be able to keep anything. Instead of it falling into the hands of outsiders, it's better to fall into our own family. You hide some things for me, and after the struggle is over, your uncle won't treat you badly. We'll split it three-seven." Zengfu thought this was a good idea, both humane and beneficial. So he and his wife hid some packages and other things. The next day, he got up before dawn and pulled a large cart of cotton from Jianshan Wuyue, planning to sell it at the market in the city. As soon as he left the gate, he was caught by the militiamen who had been lying in wait, and was greatly embarrassed. Zengfu blushed and pulled it back.

　　The matter quickly spread throughout the village, and everyone hated Zengfu to the core. When reorganizing the organization, middle and poor peasants all joined the association. When discussing Zengfu, everyone said, "He's good for nothing but messing things up!" "He's a lickspittle, a troublemaker." "A good-for-nothing, cheapskate"… "We don't want him!" So Zengfu and those former puppet soldiers and collaborators were all removed from the farmers' association.

　　The farmers' association and women's association were re-established, representatives were elected to hold a large meeting, policies were explained, and class status was determined. The loudspeaker blared from the rooftops several times a day, and the members were all smiles, enthusiastically making a big splash. Zengfu saw that except for a few families of convicted puppet soldiers, everyone in the village, men and women, had joined the association. He felt a little flustered. He wondered why the group leader hadn't called him to the meeting since he was also a member of the basic masses. He was puzzled. When he tried to ask someone, people in the street avoided him. Zengfu then realized that people despised him. Full of disappointment and ashamed, he stayed at home, covering his head and sleeping.

　　One day, Xiao Lu (Zengfu's eldest son) came back from school, with tears in his eyes and a red face, saying, "Mom! My classmates all call me 'white tail tip' and smear their faces with their fingers to mock me. I told the teacher, but she didn't care." Zengfu felt as if he had been insulted, his head spinning and burning. His wife pursed her lips, signaling Xiao Lu not to talk nonsense.

　　Another time, Xiao Lu ran back breathlessly and said to his mother, "They wrote a song about my dad on the blackboard newspaper in the street, and a lot of people were standing around watching, clapping their hands and chanting it." The mother again suppressed Xiao Lu, telling him not to be so talkative. Zengfu said, "It doesn't matter, we're all family here. Tell Xiao Lu to recite it, let's hear what they wrote!"

　　Xiao Lu was a clever child and didn't understand much about the world. He just thought the song was catchy and well-rhymed, and he had already memorized it. When his dad ordered him to, he happily recited it:

　　Li Zengfu, so stubborn:
　　Doesn't work, just chases rabbits.

　　Zengfu's wife interjected, complaining: See! I told you not to chase rabbits, but you wouldn't listen, and now they've written it into a song.

　　During the famine years, he was in trouble,
　　Sold the house and then the land,
　　Couldn't support his wife and children,
　　Fled to his wife's family for a year.

　　Zengfu's wife said: They're so idle, they even wrote about her mother's sore spot.

　　His mother-in-law was seeing stars from hunger,
　　Zengfu was crying for his mom from hunger.
　　Zengfu came up with a good idea,
　　Said good things to his uncle,
　　Three dou of grain, one dou of bran,
　　Priced it before borrowing.

　　Grain exchanged for house, both families happy,
　　Zengfu was left with nothing.

　　When Zengfu heard this, every line was the truth, and he forced a wry smile on his face, feeling distressed. He thought: It's not false at all. During the famine years, he said so many good things to his old Uncle Ji before he lent him three dou of grain, one of which was bran. He even set a condition that if he couldn't repay it in two months, the house would be considered given to his uncle. His aunt even said: "This is a good deal, goods for goods makes both families happy. People can save their lives, and property that's lost will come back! If we weren't family, who would be willing to give up grain these days…" When the deadline came, he couldn't repay it, and his uncle told him to move out. Originally a courtyard with rooms on all four sides, ten or twenty dan of grain wouldn't be enough to compensate. There was no other way but to reason with him himself, asking his uncle to add another dan of grain wasn't excessive. His aunt's donkey face was annoying: "Young man! You really don't know what's good for you! You can eat houses and drink houses, if you can't bear to leave, then don't move! My big house and large courtyard aren't jealous of your broken chicken coop, you should just give us the grain…" Thinking of this, Zengfu felt a burning in his heart. He glanced at Xiao Lu, and Xiao Lu continued to recite:

　　The Land Reform Law is truly strong,
　　Redeemed the house and then the land,
　　Everyone says Chairman Mao is good,
　　Zengfu's heart and mouth are not the same.
　　As a militiaman, he doesn't stand guard,
　　Doesn't attend meetings,
　　These mistakes aren't too big,
　　Leaking information is truly inappropriate.

　　After turning over, he forgets the kindness,
　　Befriends the landlords,
　　White tail tip, wags a few times,
　　Forgets all the suffering of hunger!
　　Sending messages, covering up,
　　Transporting cotton, hiding packages,
　　Three or five, uncountable…

　　After listening to this passage of lyrics, every sentence was like a small knife stabbing at his heart, painful, ashamed, and resentful. He cried secretly under the blanket for most of the day and didn't eat dinner. Waiting for the night to be quiet, he took out the packages he had hidden for Old Ji a few days ago from the kang hole and walked out without saying a word.

　　His wife grabbed him and said, "Where are you going?"

　　Zengfu's eyes were red as he said, "I'm going to the farmers' association to confess!"

　　His wife asked in a panic, "You want to confess our own uncle?"

　　"Damn it! If you don't mention our own uncle, I won't get angry! Have you forgotten what happened during the famine years! Now that there's a struggle, you're calling him 'sweet brother' and 'dear sister', acting so intimately. After this is over, who will recognize you as a relative? I used to be kept in the dark, but now I see it all clearly! I have to go to the farmers' association to confess! Otherwise, will we even be considered human in the village?!"

　　After hearing his words, his wife took a package from his hand and followed him out.

    白尾巴尖
    田晴
    增福在村里有名的“二子筋”，性子傲，脾气劣，无论跟谁，他心里一不高兴，可定不住开什么腔，因此乡亲们知道他不是“物”，蔽过一点，谁也不愿意和他打交道。
    事变前增福也算个肉头主，由于他好吃懒做，日子就渐渐衰落下去。灾荒年混不住，把房子和地都贱贱地卖净了；老婆孩子糊不住嘴，送往娘家去，家里剩下增福和他娘，两个人谁也养活不住谁，也就分开来另过。灾荒年虽说闯了出来，一家子都饿得灰皮焦脸的，成了瘦皮猴。
    三十二年土地法令下来，增福觉着穷人又有了活路，笑眯眯地一趟一趟找村长，村长说：“好！别忙！政府法令就是照顾基本群众，你既是一个赤贫户，一定可以都赎回来。”增福今天盼，明天盼，到秋来果然赎回来自己的房子和十三亩地，地里还带着庄稼，算下来干手摸鱼，净收了五布袋谷子七百斤红薯，一百多斤棉花。这时有了吃的穿的，日子不大，满够受活，于是把老婆孩子都叫回来又成了一家子人。
    拔了刀子、忘了痛，增福依旧是好吃懒做，灾荒年虽知道挨饿可怕，而事情过去了也就随着忘了，平常窝窝头不愿吃，还得“改善改善”，买个果子馍馍换换口味；男人吃老婆不吃不好，大人吃孩子看也使不得，一吃就是全家福。
    地里活热了不愿做，累了不愿做，不高兴不做，打起兔子来便把一切扔下都不管了，别人的庄稼壮生生的，长的好，增福的庄稼绿茫茫一片，草苗不分，一帮上人坐到一块闲拉话时就劝劝他：“地赎回来要好好干！别辜负了毛主席的一片好心。”增福一个耳朵眼听进去，一个耳朵眼便跑了，还说俏皮话：“大草遮着凉，小草做着伴，再要长不好，那才出了怪”。劝的人一看枣木圪＠五花头，劈不开，也就不在死人脸前打呵气了。
    三十四年，附近的村子都闹斗争，未庄也叽咕着闹起来，成立了农会选举了主任，大家觉着增福也是基本群众，让他也加入吧，派人一串通，可碰了钉子，增福说：“好没声地斗人家，我不干这昧良心的事，净一伙子穷山兔子发穷急！”
    这句话传回去，会员们一听可都火了，有的说：讲良心先把他赎回来的房子地都退回来，有的说：骂人先斗他………你一言我一语，最后决定先用道理说服，实在不行就用这办法。于是主任领着十三个组长找增福去了，先讲了一回为什么要翻身的道理，又告诉他群众对他不满意，增福一看来头不对，心里不愿意在农会，也只得勉强答应了。
    斗争期间增福常经他老积叔（被斗户）家里去，农会的事情，甚至谁说的什么话，被斗户摸的都很清，大家想除了增福透气没别人。小组会上批评他，还“动态度”，咬住死嘴不承认。
    群运过去了，要发展民兵，本村年纪轻些的，差不多都在奉天首饰楼上当学徒，增福三十六岁七，瘸子里边是将军还不算太大，队长动员他，增福说：“我可不干这件子！”队长问：“你把房子地都赎回来，又分了果实（二千元）是沾的谁的光？”增福说：“不是沾的你的光，政府的命令！”他的意思是说理所当然没有什么可打情的。“光政府命令，没人保护政府也不行呀！”队长还算有一套，左说右说，到底把增福说得哑哑无言，答应参加了。
    增福当了民兵，心里可不是味，每次开会都不去，晚上站岗更不用提了。队上派人来叫，他就让老婆应一声说：“没在家。”叫的人知道他装佯，到屋里找，增福就不客气地骂：“谁有他妈的功夫干这！我就不去！你们开除我吧！”
    大家知道他不好斗，于是以后民兵队上他就只挂着一个空名字，随管有什么事也就不找他。
    去年腊月间，全县布置翻身大检查，翻身队一批批下了乡，末庄也就象平静的池水投了一块大石头，波动起来了。
    翻身队来到村中一调查，知道上次斗的不好：群众没有诉苦出气，地主没有消灭打垮，果实没有合理分配，只干部翻了身，基本群众还在泥淖里……根据以上情况这次要彻底搞一搞，做到名符其实的耕者有其田，要群众出完气翻透身。
    地主们听到这消息，好似晴天打霹雳，说不定弄到哪，吓的直打颤。老积悄悄把增福叫到家里说：“小娃！你知道这回斗争更厉害哩！东西反正怕落不住了，填给了外姓人，不如落在咱己家里，你给收藏住些，等斗争过去了，叔叔不亏你，咱们三七分。”增福一听觉着好，又有人情又有好处；于是光和老婆给藏了些包袱什么的，第二天起了个大五更，又拉了尖山五岳的一大车棉花，预备到城里集上卖，一出大门早被民兵事先布置好的岗哨查获，大大的弄了个没趣，增福红着脸又拉回去。
    事情很快在村子里传遍，大家都咬着牙把增福恨透了；整理组织时中农贫农都入了会，讨论到增福，大家都说：“成事不足坏事有余！”“溜沟子舐腚，泄气走里”。“白（摆）尾（椅）巴尖子贱骨头”………“不要他！”于是增福就和那些伪军伪组织人员一齐被农会给刷了。
    农会妇会都重新成立起来，选代表开大会，讲政策划分阶级，喇叭筒一天在房上喊几遍，会员们一个个满脸笑容，兴冲冲地闹的好不红火，增福一看除了几家有法的伪军没参加，全村男女都在了会，心里就有些慌；等着组长来叫，又没消息。自己也是基本群众为什么开会都不叫呢？他怪纳闷的。找个人问问吧，街里的人见了都躲着走，增福这时才明白了人家刷了满肚子懊丧，没脸见人，就躺在家里蒙着头睡。
    一天小路（增福的大儿子）下学回来，眼里还含着泪，红着脸说：“娘！俺学生们都喊我小白尾巴尖子，还用指头抹着脸皮来臊俺，给老师说了也不管。”增福听了就如自己受了侮辱，头一阵阵发蒙发烧，他媳妇呶着嘴示意小路不许他再胡说八道。
    又一次小路气喘吁吁地跑回来对妈说：“街里黑板报上给俺爹编了个歌，一大堆人围着看，拍着手大笑着念哩。”母亲又压制着小路，不许多嘴。增福说：“不要紧没外人，叫小路念念，咱听听净编的啥！”
    小路小孩子家很聪明，也不多懂世故，光觉着那歌又顺口，又合联，早就背熟了，等他爹这一吩咐，他就高兴的念道：
    李增福，真顽固：
    不干活，光打兔。
    增福家插进来抱怨地说：看！是不！我说别打兔子了你就不听，高低给编出来了。
    灾荒年，作了难，
    卖了宅子又卖田，
    老婆孩子养不住，
    逃到娘家住一年。
    增福家说：闲的他们，这事也碍着他娘那×痛给编上。
    饿的他娘眼发花，
    饿的增福直叫妈。
    增福想了个好办法，
    叔叔跟前说好话，
    三斗谷子一斗糠，
    未借以前先作价。
    粮食换房两家乐，
    增福落了个光踏踏。
    增福一听句句是实话，脸上勉强苦笑了一下，不由就难过起来。他想：一点不假，过灾荒年给老积叔叔说了多少好话，才借给三斗谷子，里边还有一斗糠，还订下条件两个月还不了，就把房子算给叔叔，婶婶还说：“数这好，货换货两家乐，人能保住命，财产走了还会来！要不是自家人，这年头有法的谁还露粮食………”到期了还不还，叔叔叫挪房子。本来四面头院，十担二十担粮食也不抵，没办法自己得说理，要求叔叔再添一担谷子可不算过火，婶婶搭拉着那叫驴脸可恼了：“小娃！你真不知好歹！能吃房子喝房子，你舍不了甭挪了！俺高宅子大院的可不眼气你这破鸡窝，你还给谷子吧………。”增福一想到这，心里就火辣辣的，他看了小路一眼，小路又念起来了：
    赎地法令真是强，
    赎了宅子又赎房，
    人人都说毛主席好，
    增福心嘴不一样，
    当民兵，不站岗，
    开大会不到场，
    这些过错不算大，
    通风泄气真真不应当。
    翻了身，忘了恩，
    跟地主混成一家人，
    白尾巴尖，摇几摇，
    挨饿受气的事儿全忘了！
    送消息，打掩护，
    运棉花，藏包袱，
    三个五个没数数………
    增福听完这一段歌词，每一句都象一把小刀子扎着他的心，又痛苦又惭愧，又愤恨，蒙着被子偷偷哭了大半天，晚上也没吃饭，等着夜静了从炕洞里掏出头几天给老积藏的包袱，二句话不说就往外走。
    老婆一把拦住道：“你往哪去？”
    增福他的眼珠子红红的说：“我到农会坦白去！”
    老婆惊慌的反问他：“你要坦白咱亲叔叔？”
    “日他娘！不提亲叔叔还不生气！你忘了灾荒年那回事了！这会儿怕斗争，甜哥哥密姐姐，到拉起亲来了，看过了这一段，谁还认你亲侄子。往常我还装在鼓里，这回我可看透啦！非到农会里坦白去不可！要不咱在村里还有一点人味？！
    老婆听完了他的话，从他手上接了个包袱，也跟着他走了出去。
