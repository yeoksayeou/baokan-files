Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 7th. A comprehensive report from Paris: Amidst the intensifying contradictions between Britain, France, and the United States over the Ruhr issue, U.S. Undersecretary of State for Economic Affairs Clayton was suddenly ordered on July 31st to rush from Geneva to Paris to seek countermeasures for the obstruction of the Marshall Plan. It is reported that Clayton, along with U.S. Ambassador to Britain Douglas, and U.S. Ambassador to France Caffery, held preliminary talks on the morning of the 4th. On the afternoon of the same day, a secret meeting of four people, including Murphy, the political advisor to the U.S. military headquarters in Germany, was held to discuss European issues, especially the European situation caused by the German problem. At the same time, according to the Associated Press: British Trade Minister Cripps arrived in Paris on the 1st to discuss with Clayton the issue of Britain reducing imports of American goods. The Labor government will take urgent and drastic measures, immediately reducing the army, restricting the import of American goods to save US dollars, the Anglo-American Ruhr coal production conference will be postponed... etc. news constantly spread from Britain to Paris. The French diplomatic community also publicly expressed "great" agitation and surprise on the 3rd, expressing dissatisfaction with U.S. Army Secretary Royal's disregard for France's position in Berlin on the 1st, declaring that "there is no so-called U.S.-French agreement that the issue of raising Germany's industrial level must be discussed with France before a decision is made," and reiterated that the issue of raising Germany's industrial level must be decided by the four powers according to the Potsdam Agreement. General observers in Paris believe that the above-mentioned postures of Britain and France seem to be a kind of psychological warfare offensive, trying to exchange Marshall's modification of its "plan" to be favorable to Britain and France.

　　马歇尔计划推行不顺利
  　英法美神经战激烈
    【新华社陕北七日电】综合巴黎讯：当英法美围绕鲁尔问题的矛盾日趋激化之际，美国务院主掌经济事务之副国务卿克莱顿突于七月卅一日奉命自日内瓦匆匆赶至巴黎，觅求对马歇尔计划推行受阻之对策。据悉，克莱顿与美国驻英大使道格拉期，与美驻法大使卡夫利于四日上午举行初步会谈，当日下午召开包括德境美军总部政治顾问莫菲在内之四人密秘会议，商讨欧洲问题，特别是由德国问题所引起的欧洲形势问题。与此同时，据美联社讯：英商务大臣克利浦斯于一日抵巴黎与克莱顿商谈英国减少美货输入问题。工党政府将采取紧急的激烈措施，立即减缩军队呀，限制美货入口以节省美元呀，英美鲁尔煤产会议又将延期呀…………等等消息，又不断自英伦传至巴黎。而法国外交界亦于三日公开表示“极大的”激动与惊异，对美国陆长罗雅尔一日在柏林无视法国地位宣称“并无所谓关系德国提高工业水平问题必先与法国商讨始作决议之美法协议”一事表示不满，并再次声明提高德国工业水平问题，必须根据波茨顿协定，由四强决议。巴黎一般观察家咸认英法上述各种姿态，似系一种神经战攻势，力图换取马歇尔对其“计划”作有利于英法之某种修改。
