    Border Region Government Agencies Plant Vegetables After Rain
    [This Newspaper Report] The production movement in the Border Region Government agencies has once again become a popular trend, with efforts being made to repair beaches and open up land for large-scale planting of autumn vegetables. A few days ago, rainfall occurred in the villages near the Border Region Government's location. Agency personnel immediately seized the opportunity to purchase vegetable seeds for planting, and the Production Committee stipulated autumn vegetable delivery quotas and standards to encourage more planting. Currently, the General Affairs Department has repaired land on the river beach, and the Finance Department has cleared two fen of land in the forest for planting. The Secretariat has also found two or three fen of hillside land and is repairing it. Other units are also rushing to plant or replant. (Xiu Shan)

    边府机关雨后种菜
    【本报讯】边府机关生产运动再成热潮，修滩开地大种秋菜。日前边府驻地附近各村降雨，机关人员即抓紧时机，购买菜籽种菜，生产委员会并规定秋菜抵交任务标准鼓励多种。现总务处已在河滩修地，财政厅在树林刨地二分，开始下种，秘书室也找好坡地二、三分，正修理，其他各单位均在抢种或补种中。（秀山）
