    The Taihang Spring Hundred-Day Textile Movement, under the leadership and promotion of local heroes, model cadres, activists, and woodworking technicians, broke through numerous difficulties and formed a conscious, mass-based large-scale production movement. According to preliminary statistics from thirty counties, including Licheng and Pingshun, within seventy days, 470,000 women were involved in the movement (accounting for nearly half of the total number of women), including 200,000 new textile workers. 470,000 spinning wheels and 90,000 looms were put into operation, producing more than 7.1 million jin of cloth, completing 65% of the original plan, and still having more than 1 million jin of yarn in stock, solving the spring seasonal clothing needs of 4.2 million people with a surplus. The key to achieving these results lies in:

　　(1) In-depth Mobilization and Thorough Ideological Leadership
    The first step is to clear up thinking and clarify the purpose of textile production. At the beginning of the movement, due to the heavy tasks and tight deadlines of the Hundred-Day Textile campaign, women generally commented, "The government is pushing so hard, it must be for public use." Li Feng, the women's salvation committee member of Huo Jia Yao in Licheng, said, "We must complete the task given to us by the higher authorities, and not lag behind other villages." Shi Haitang then said, "The cadres keep urging us to spin and weave, we have no choice but to do it for them." Later, they also felt, "Although we are spinning and weaving for ourselves, we really can't weave enough!" Therefore, they reflected, "How much longer until we get through these hundred days!" So after the summary, everyone wanted to "take a break." In addition, some middle peasants had some concerns about getting rich, and many new areas in Taihang lacked a textile foundation, believing that Shanxi people could not handle this line of work, or that "one is too old to learn a new skill after thirty," etc.… In the process of ideological mobilization to solve confused ideas, individual places simply solved specific confused thoughts, such as seeing someone afraid of getting rich, they explained with specific examples of being praised for getting rich through labor; regarding the "for public use" idea, they used "Men's mutual aid production is tightly controlled every year, and the grain harvested is their own. This year, textile production is tightly controlled, and the cloth woven must also be their own." This often clarified the first problem, but then the second and third problems would arise. The problems were not fundamentally solved. However, most places conducted in-depth ideological mobilization, raised class consciousness, and promoted the advancement of the movement by developing and mastering the positive factors in the production of the broad masses of women. In the movement, they used the masses' own thoughts, combined with the power of the movement, to solve specific confused ideas among individual masses. For example, in Beiliu, Huo Jia Yao, and Qiushuyuan villages in Licheng, at the beginning of the Hundred-Day Textile campaign, they organized women to discuss "What should we do after turning over?" and "Who is textile production really for?" through heroes and activists, combining recollections of the oppression of the poor and the mistreatment of women in the old society, and instilling the enthusiasm for turning over into getting rich through textile production. At the same time, they conducted specific accounting, dug out the roots of poverty and planted the roots of wealth, and used the stories of specific people, households, and villages getting rich through textile production to guide everyone to realize that they could not achieve "耕三余一" (a traditional ideal of leaving enough to eat for one year after working the land for three) without textile production. For example, Huangchi Village in the first district of Lucheng carefully calculated that the whole village could only achieve "耕十六余一" without textile production, but with textile production, they would have seven more shi of grain left over after achieving "耕三余一". This kind of repeated accounting greatly increased the women's enthusiasm for textile production, and all places consciously proposed "Rather sell cloth to buy flowers, than sell flowers to buy cloth!" and "If you want to get rich, sell cloth, don't sell flowers!" To achieve "Every family changes seasons without buying cloth." After the movement was launched, the leadership faced the backward, patiently explained and persuaded in a "圪扯" (dialect for tedious and patient persuasion) manner, and brought the backward into the movement, making the Hundred-Day Textile campaign a conscious production movement of the entire mass of women. After the summary, they did not have the idea of taking a break, but continued to increase production and continue to promote and deepen the movement. Experience has proven that only the latter method can guide the masses' thinking to continuously improve and advance.

　　(2) Solving Difficulties and Universally Organizing.
    The women's demands for organization were mostly opposed by their parents-in-law and husbands, who were afraid that the women would learn bad habits and cause family conflicts after participating in textile groups, or that they would only care about making money through textile production and disregard household livelihood. The leadership then resolved the difficulties for women to participate in organizations based on the principle of taking care of the family, uniting couples, and maintaining harmony. The second district of Licheng proposed the integration of textile production, family chores, and agricultural production to resolve the contradiction between textile production and family livelihood. Ximan Village in the second district of Lucheng set rules in the textile group and notified the family to visit and listen, to eliminate the family's dissatisfaction with the textile group and their concerns about women participating in the group. Their rules generally included the following: First, strive to produce and study hard in the group to ensure that they learn the skills. Second, ensure no rogue behavior. Third, ensure no idle talk and no quarrels. Fourth, ensure that textile production is combined with family affairs, so that neither is delayed. When mobilizing students for the textile training class in Weijia Village, the cadres made a guarantee to the family that if any problems occurred, the cadres would be fully responsible. At the same time, all places solved the difficulty of families changing seasons by providing specific benefits to the family and improving the relationship between textile workers and their families. When Ji Zhen's family in Ximan Village lost the head of the household and needed to wear mourning clothes, the group immediately lent him cloth, without the family having to sell grain to buy cloth, and the whole family was grateful. The Textile Committee seized on this and immediately launched a discussion in the whole village, which improved the relationship between women and their families, raised the status of women, strengthened the family's confidence in textile production, won the joy of parents-in-law, and bought looms and flowers for their daughters-in-law, which in turn solved the problem of tools and raw materials for the textile group.

    In terms of organizational principles, the leadership generally paid attention to using poor peasant women who had turned over as the backbone, excluding feudal forces and consolidating the organization. The method of Lishu Village in Xiangyuan was to have two or three active members of the emancipated households in each group to actively lead the backbone role in the group. At the same time, they also raised their vigilance to prevent landlords from taking advantage of loopholes and sabotaging the work. In Hejia Slope in the fifth district, Liu Jüzhen, a landlord woman, served as a committee member for rescue, ostensibly active but secretly sabotaging, using small favors to win over some women, often opposing Li Xue'e, the chairman of the women's salvation association, causing disunity among the women in the village and hindering the work. Li Xue'e then used her own recounting of suffering and self-reflection to inspire the women's hatred for the landlords, expose Liu Jüzhen's conspiracy, patiently educate and persuade the women who were used by her, unite all the women, overthrow Liu Jüzhen, and clear the obstacles to the textile work. When Changzhi trained textile workers, they used poor peasant families who had turned over as the backbone, with at least one person in each village learning to weave cloth with hand-pulled shuttle looms and the Yan'an large-wheel spinning wheel, using them as the backbone to return to the village to train apprentices and carry out textile production.

    In terms of organizational forms and management methods, the masses' creations in this movement were extremely rich. Generally, they can be divided into three types:

    1. Small-scale factories: They are the product of a good foundation in the textile movement, and are a further development of general textile organizations. The basic task is to improve quality and increase production, with members separating from production, living collectively, and working collectively. Some are operated by cooperatives, and some are operated by textile groups that pool shares. However, since textile production is still basically a sideline today, according to the experience of Xiyang and Pingshun, this form cannot be universally promoted in rural areas. In some individual areas of Pingshun, they mechanically copied the experience, seeing others run factories, they also ran factories, concentrating the looms and weavers in the village in the factory, turning the workers into long-term workers, and using the tools as shares. This caused many contradictions between the masses and the factory, with the masses demanding to get rich and the factory demanding to run the factory; after entering the factory, the factory demanded that the workers weave more cloth and make more money, while the workers did not lack food, learned slowly, and did not improve their skills; secondly, the workers demanded to leave the factory early, while the factory delayed or refused to let them leave, saying that they could not leave without learning the skills, and had to repay the favor or serve for a few months. At the same time, participation in the factory was ostensibly voluntary, but in fact, there were many conflicts with the family, or it undermined the textile group, or hindered the cooperative, bringing together those who could weave, thus affecting the development of the mass textile movement. The approach of Licheng is to grasp the characteristics of the rural decentralized economy. Participation in the factory must be well combined with the family's demands and scattered life, not excessively emphasizing the collective, adopting collective leadership and decentralized management, and they can spin in the factory or at home. In addition to fixed workers, they also absorb those with surplus labor to spin for the factory. This solves the contradiction between collective management and decentralized economy, and plays a core leadership role in the textile production of each village.

    2. Small-scale textile cooperation is an organizational form that is a step up from the textile group. Under the principle of equality and voluntariness, women freely invest shares, using cotton yarn and tools as capital shares, and labor as labor shares, combining it with family life and agricultural production, labor-capital cooperation, and reasonable profit sharing. They work collectively, but do not live together, so they get rich quickly, and the masses can join and leave freely, which meets the requirements of today's rural decentralized economy. The main problem is equal value for work and reasonable profit sharing. The method of calculating work points varies from place to place, but most specifically determine how many work points are earned for weaving how much cloth, spinning how much yarn, and winding how much yarn, in principle, the points are determined according to the lightness of the work and the size of the technicality. There are two methods for profit sharing: 20% capital, 80% labor, or 30/70 or 90/10, and some also draw out a small portion (about 10%) to reward active members. There are two issues worth noting in profit sharing: first, profit sharing should be timely, so that the masses can benefit quickly, dispel the concerns about weaving for the public and the resistance of the family, and make them feel that textile production can really make them rich. The second is the issue of women giving dividends to their families after receiving their dividends. The method of Huo Jia Yao in Licheng is as follows: for those whose families manage the raw materials, take care of the children, and do odd jobs, it is divided 40/60 (family 60, women 40). For those whose families only manage the raw materials, it is divided 40/60 in reverse. For families with children who do odd jobs but do not manage the raw materials, it is divided 50/50, and for families that do not manage anything, the women automatically give 20% to the family to consolidate the relationship. Some families also pay attention to rewarding women. For example, Huo Shouyi rewarded his daughter-in-law 2,000 yuan and his wife 500 yuan when he received dividends from the transportation team, encouraging them to work hard in textile production, but this method cannot be mechanically implemented, and should be based on the concept of family harmony, and cannot rigidly adhere to profit sharing. Some families were originally very united, but after determining profit sharing, they became alienated from each other, and the mothers-in-law reflected, "One family is divided into two families." Beiliu in Licheng proposed that women should be "good in three ways: in the family, to the masses, and in participating in textile production," and held mother-in-law and daughter-in-law meetings to discuss how to make the family harmonious. The general reflection is: "Everyone is messed up in one pot," "You have the first day of the lunar month, I have the fifteenth day," proving that all problems can be solved if the family is harmonious. In general, cooperatives can jointly manage collective operations under the principle of combining family production, and each can specialize in their own strengths, study technology, improve quality, increase production profits, and expand production, which is worthy of research and promotion as a new direction for the widespread development of the rural textile movement.

    3. Private operation and collective leadership of textile groups, self-spinning and self-weaving, and self-gaining of benefits. Under the leadership of the village textile committee, attention is paid to matching novices with experienced workers, active workers with backward workers, freely forming groups, electing leaders, regularly checking and holding meetings to exchange experiences, or concentrating on textile production and exchanging at equal value, or dispersing activities that can be voluntarily listened to. This method is closely linked to the individual's plan for getting rich, and closely related to the actual interests of the family, which is suitable for the habits of peasant families and the requirements for organization. It is best to unify the textile group and the women's salvation association organization to facilitate leadership and have practical content, but leadership must be strengthened, the organization must be improved, and self-flow must be prevented. The characteristic of this movement is that under the leadership of textile committees at all levels, textile women are universally organized. However, the organization method must be based on the actual conditions of each place, be based on the voluntary and conscious participation of the masses, and cannot mechanically copy and excessively emphasize the form. The diverse creations of the masses' wisdom are worthy of praise and are precious. For example, in many areas of Lin County, primary school education is combined with textile production, and young girls' textile flower groups are established in every village, spinning flowers while learning to read. There are also three or five people who spin their own flowers during the day and spin collectively at night, which is both lively and saves oil. They call this the kerosene mutual aid group and other forms, which have powerfully promoted the textile movement.

　　太行春季百日纺织运动介绍
    本报资料室
    太行春季百日纺织运动，在各地英雄模范干部积极分子及木工技师的带头推动下，冲破重重困难，形成了自觉的群众性的大生产运动。根据黎城、平顺等三十县的初步统计，七十天内卷入运动的有四十七万纺妇（占妇女总数将近一半），其中新增纺妇二十万人，开动纺车四十七万辆，织机九万架，织布七百一十余万斤，完成原计划百分之六十五，还存线一百余万斤，解决了四百二十万群众的春季换季问题还有余。获得这些成绩的关键在于：
　　（一）深入发动贯澈思想领导
    首先是打通思想明确纺织目的。运动刚开始，由于布置百日纺织时，任务重抓的紧，妇女们便普遍议论“政府追得这样紧，一定要交公的”。黎城霍家窑的妇救常委李凤说：“上级给咱们的任务，咱一定得完成，不要落了外村后。”史海棠便说：“干部一直追着叫咱纺织，反正不纺也不行，咱就给人家纺吧”。以后又觉得“虽然是给自己纺织，可实在织不够数儿啊！”因此反映着“多会才熬过一百天啦”！所以一总结便都想“歇一歇”。另外有些中农对于发家致富多少有顾虑，以及太行不少新区纺织没有基础，认为山西人吃不了这一行饭，或者是“人过三十不学艺”等……………。在思想发动解决糊涂观念的过程中，个别地方单纯的解决具体糊涂思想，例如看到有人怕发家，便以劳动发家受表扬的具体例子给解释；对“交公”思想，便用“年年男人互助生产抓得紧，打下粮食是自己的，今年纺织抓得紧，织下布也一定是自己的。”这样往往弄清了第一个问题，接着就又来了第二个第三个问题，问题没有取得根本解决，而大部地方则是深入进行思想发动，提高阶级觉悟，从发扬与掌握广大妇女群众生产中的积极因素，推动运动前进，在运动中以群众自己的思想，结合运动力量，解决个别群众中的具体糊涂观念。例如黎城北流、霍家窑、秋树垣等村，百日纺织一开始，就通过英雄积极分子，组织妇女讨论“翻身以后应干啥”？“纺织到底为谁”等问题，结合回忆过去旧社会中穷人受压迫，妇女不当人的痛苦，把翻身的热情贯串到纺织发家上。同时进行了具体算帐，挖了穷根栽富根，以具体人具体户具体村的纺织发家故事引导大家认识不纺织就不能达到耕三余一。如潞城一区黄池村细细计算，全村不纺织只能达到耕十六余一，加上纺织则耕三余一还剩七石粮，这样往返算帐，妇女纺织热情便大为提高，各地纷纷自觉提出“能叫卖布买花，不叫卖花买布”！“要想发家卖布不卖花”！要做到“家家换季不买布”。运动开展后，领导上又面向落后，用圪扯方式耐心解释说服，把落后层也卷入运动，使百日纺织成为全体妇女群众性的自觉生产运动。在总结后不是产生歇歇思想，而是继续增产，继续推广和深入。经验证明：只有后一种办法才能指导群众思想不断提高与前进。
　　（二）解决困难普遍组织起来。
    妇女们组织起来的要求，多半会遭到家庭翁婆丈夫的反对，怕妇女们参加纺织组后学坏和家庭闹矛盾，或者是不顾家庭营生只管自己纺织赚钱。领导上便以照顾家庭团结夫妇和睦为原则，解决妇女与家庭或天妇关系，排除妇女参加组织的困难。黎城二区提出纺织、家庭零活、农业生产三大结合，解决纺织和家庭营生的矛盾。潞城二区西满村则在纺织小组中定纪律，通知家庭参观旁听的办法，扫除家庭对纺织小组的不满和对妇女参加小组的顾虑。她们的纪律大致有这么几条：第一、在小组要努力生产加紧学习，保证学成把式。第二、保证不流氓。第三、保证不说闲话不闹气。第四、保证纺织要和家里的事结合起来，作到两不耽误。魏家庄纺织训练班动员学员时，干部向家庭提出保证，如果发生问题由干部负完全责任。同时各地都以解决家庭换季用布困难，给家庭以具体利益，以改善纺妇和家庭关系。西满村寄珍家死了当家人要发丧穿孝，小组里立即借给他布，不用家里粜粮食买布，全家都感激。纺委会抓住这个，即在全村展开讨论，从此改善了妇女与家庭的关系，提高了妇女的地位，加强了家庭对纺织的信心，讨得了翁婆的欢喜，给媳妇又打机又买花，转而解决了纺织组的工具原料问题。
    在组织原则上，领导方面普遍地注意到以贫农翻身妇女为骨干，排挤封建巩固组织。襄垣黎树后的办法是每组掌握两三个翻身户的积极分子，让她们在组内积极领导起骨干作用。同时也提高警觉，防止地主钻空破坏。五区和家坡，有个地主妇女刘菊珍担任营救常委，表面积极，暗地破坏，以小恩小惠拉拢一部分妇女，经常和妇救主席李雪娥作对，闹得该村妇女不团结，工作总是搞不好。李雪娥便以自己的诉苦反省，启发妇女对地主们的仇恨，揭破刘菊珍的阴谋，对被她利用的妇女，耐心教育说服，团结了全体妇女，斗垮刘菊珍，清除了纺织工作的障碍。长治训练纺妇时就以贫农翻身户为骨干，每村最少一人学用手拉梭机织布和延安大轮纺车，以她们为骨干回村带徒弟开展纺织。
    组织形式与经营方法方面，这次运动中群众的创造是极其丰富的。一般的可分为三种：
    一、小型工厂：它是在纺织运动较好的基础上的产物，是一般纺织组织进一步的发展。基本任务在于提高质量增加产量，成员脱离生产集体生活集体作活。有的是合作社经营，有的是纺织组队集股经营。但由于纺织在今日基本上还是副业，根据昔阳平顺等地经验，这种形式在农村中还不能普遍推广。平顺个别地区死搬经验，见别人搞工厂，自己也搞，把村里的织布机和织布工人都集中到工厂里，工人变为长期工人，工具作为入股。这样群众和工厂之间就闹出许多矛盾，群众要求发家，工厂要求发厂；进厂后工厂要求工人多织布多赚钱，工人方面则是不缺吃，慢慢学、技术提不高；其次是工人要求早出厂，工厂是迟出或不出，学会技术不能白走，要报恩或服务几个月。同时参加工厂的表面上是自愿，实际上多与家庭有矛盾，或者是抽垮了纺织组，或者是妨碍了合作社，把会纺织的集在一起，因而影响群众性纺织运动的开展。黎城的作法是掌握农村分散经济的特点。参加工厂必须与家庭要求和家庭零碎生活结合好，不过分强调集体，采取集体领导分散经营，可以在厂纺，也可以在家纺，除了固定工人外还吸收有剩余劳力的给工厂纺织。这样解决了集体经营与分散经济的矛盾，对各村纺织起了核心领导作用。
    二、小型纺织合作，是由纺织小组提高一步的组织形式，在平等自愿原则下，妇女们自由入股，以棉花线、工具作资金股，按活计工作劳力股，和家庭生活、农业生产相结合，劳资合作，合理分红。集体劳动，但不在一起生活，这样发家来得快，群众进出自由，合乎今日农村分散经济的要求。其中主要问题是等价变工，合理分红。计工办法，各地不同，多半是具体定出织多少布算多少工，纺多少线，络多少线算多少工，原则上按活轻重技术性大小规定分数。分红办法有二、八（资二劳八），三、七或九、一，也有抽出一少部分（百分之十左右）奖励积极分子的。分红中有两个问题值得注意，第一分红要及时，让群众得利快，打破给公家纺织的顾虑及家庭的阻力，使她们觉得纺织真能发家。第二是妇女分上红利后再给家庭分红的问题。黎城霍家窑的办法是有这几种：家庭管原料、看小孩、做零碎活者四、六分（家六、妇四）。家庭只管原料的倒四六分。家庭有小孩做零碎生活但不管原料的对半分，家庭啥也不管的妇女自动交家庭二分以巩固关系。有的家庭也注意了奖励妇女，如霍守义在运输队分到红利，奖儿媳两千元，老婆五百元，鼓励她们努力纺织，但这个办法不能机械执行，应从家庭和睦观念出发，不能死啃分红。有些家庭本来很团结，确定分红后，反而互相离心，婆婆反映着：“一家人说成了两家话”。黎城北流提出了妇女要三好：“在家庭、对群众、参加纺织”，召开婆媳会讨论怎样才能使家庭和好。一般反映：“一锅饭大家乱”，“你有初一我有十五”，证明家庭和睦一切问题都好解决。一般合作社能在结合家庭生产原则下，共同管理集体经营，各专一长钻研技术，提高质量增加产量，扩大生产利润，作为农村纺织运动普遍开展的新方向，值得研究推广。
    三、私人经营集体领导的纺织小组，自纺自织，利益自得。在村纺织委员会领导下，注意到新手配老手，积极配落后，自由集成小组，选出领导人，定期检查开会交流经验，或集中纺织等价交换，或分散活动可听其自愿。这种方式与个人生产发家计划结合得紧，与家庭实际利益密切，适合农民家庭习惯与组织起来的要求，最好把纺织小组和妇救会组织统一起来，便于领导又有实际内容，但必须加强领导，健全组织，防止自流。这次运动的特点是在各级纺委会领导下，纺妇织妇普遍组织起来。但组织方式必须依据各地实际情况具体条件，建立在群众自愿自觉的基础上，不能死搬硬套过分强调形式。群众智慧的多种多样的创造是值得表扬珍贵的，例如林县不少地区以小学教育结合纺织，村村成立幼女纺花小组，一面纺花一面识字。又有三五个人，白天各纺各的，晚上集体纺，又红火又省油，她们把这叫做灯油互助小组等等形式，都有力地推动了纺织运动。
