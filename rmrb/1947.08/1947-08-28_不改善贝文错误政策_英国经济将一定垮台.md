　　Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, August 25th: Moscow dispatch: Buriakov wrote in the "New Times" weekly on the British economic situation, stating that the main reason for the current British economic crisis is the erroneous policies adopted by London to cope with post-war difficulties, especially Bevin's foreign policy. Regarding the former, the author pointed out that Britain's crisis is also a crisis in Anglo-American trade relations. As a result of the loan agreement, Britain's purchases in the United States last year were artificially raised to an extremely high level (Editor's note: According to an Associated Press dispatch from London on the 21st, Britain's purchases in the United States in the first five months of this year were worth more than 500 million US dollars, while the total amount of British exports during the same period was only 170 million US dollars), while the United States cannot provide British goods with an equal amount of sales. At the same time, the Labor Party's declared nationalization of industries is not being actively implemented due to fear of spoiling relations with the magnates, which is also an important factor. Bevin's foreign policy, in many respects, has promoted and continues to promote Britain being bound by the web of American policy. One of the consequences is maintaining excessive troops, putting the Labor government in a dilemma. Therefore, the current British economic crisis is also a crisis of the Labor government's domestic and foreign policies. The author pointed out that in Anglo-American relations, the main goal of the United States is to secretly undermine British competition in the world market and limit its exports to a minimum. Therefore, Britain faces two paths to overcome the crisis: either, as the British "New Statesman and Nation" magazine stated, limit Britain's military and imperial obligations and establish an agreement with the Soviet Union; or succumb to the United States, cede the Ruhr, and risk losing the vast majority of its domestic supporters and face the danger of collapse in the near future.
　　
　　Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, August 20th: Moscow dispatch: Marinin recently commented in Pravda on the reasons for the failure of the Anglo-Soviet trade negotiations, stating that the broad masses of the British people and many politicians hope that the Anglo-Soviet trade negotiations will succeed, so that Britain's serious economic crisis can be greatly alleviated, because the Soviet Union can supply Britain with one million tons of grain and a large amount of timber this year, which can not only solve Britain's immediate economic difficulties but also meet its long-term interests and needs. However, the negotiations failed because the British side was unwilling to bear reciprocal obligations and reasonably revise the excessively harsh conditions of the British loan to the Soviet Union in August 1941. When discussing the inside story of the breakdown of the negotiations due to Britain being controlled by "dollar diplomacy," the author pointed out that the British "Truth" weekly was right in saying: "The Anglo-Soviet trade agreement and the Marshall Plan are mutually exclusive, and the British government is currently considering this." The "New Statesman and Nation" magazine pointed out: "The United States has put pressure on the British Cabinet to oppose the conclusion of a trade agreement with the Soviet Union." The London Times wrote: "The United States uses various means to prevent European countries from concluding barter or financial agreements."

　　不改善贝文错误政策  英国经济将一定垮台
    【新华社陕北二十五日电】莫斯科讯：卜利雅可夫在“新时代”周刊撰文论英国经济形势称：目前英国经济危机的主要原因是伦敦应付战后困难所采取的错误政策，特别是贝文的外交政策。关于前者，作者指出：英国的危机同时是英美贸易关系的危机。由于贷款协定的结果，英国去年在美国的购买被人工地提高到极高的水平（编者按：据美联社伦敦二十一日电，英国今年头五个月内在美购货值五亿美元以上，而同期英国之对外输出总额则仅一亿七千万美元），而美国则并不能提供英货以数量上相等的销路。同时工党对其所宣布的工业国有化，由于惧怕搞坏与大亨们的关系，而不积极实行，亦为重要因素。贝文的外交政策，则在许多方面促使了并继续在促使英国为美国政策之网所束缚。其后果之一就是保持过多的军队，使工党政府陷于进退维谷之境。因此目前英国的经济危机，又是工党政府内外政策的危机。作者指出：在英美关系上，美国的主要目的，是要暗中破坏在世界市场上英国的竞争，并限制其出口至极小限度。因此英国面临克服危机的两条道路：或者象英国“新政治家与民族”杂志所称：限制英国军队与帝国的义务，并与苏联成立协议；或者向美国屈服，让出鲁尔，而甘冒丧失其国内拥护者之绝大部分，并使自己有于最近将来垮台的危险。
    【新华社陕北二十日电】莫斯科讯：马里宁顷于真理报上评论英苏贸易谈判失败之原因称：英国广大人民和许多政治家，都希望英苏贸易谈判成功，使英国严重的经济危机得以大大减轻，因为苏联可以在今年输予英国一百万吨谷物和大量的木材，这不仅能解决英国经济眼前的困难，而且可以满足其长期的利益和需要。然而由于英方不愿负担互惠的义务及合理的修正一九四一年八月英国对苏贷款之过苛条件，谈判遂无结果。作者在谈到谈判破裂的内幕是英国为“金元外交”所控制时指出：英国“真理”周刊说得对：“英苏贸易协定与马歇尔的计划势不两立的，英政府现正在这方面打算盘。”“新政治家与民族”杂志指出：“美国曾向英内阁施以压力，反对与苏联缔结贸易协定。”伦敦泰晤士报写道：美国利用各种手段阻止欧洲各国之间缔结换货或财政协定。
