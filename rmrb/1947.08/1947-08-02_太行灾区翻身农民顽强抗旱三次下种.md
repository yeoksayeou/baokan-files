    【Special Dispatch from This Newspaper】Since the beginning of spring, most areas of Taihang have lacked rain, resulting in a severe drought. However, under the leadership and assistance of the Communist Party and the democratic government, the liberated peasants in the disaster area have highly demonstrated an extraordinary spirit of overcoming the disaster, a spirit unseen in history. After Grain Rain, people in various places organized themselves to carry water and sow seeds, and all able-bodied men, women, young, and old were involved in the rush to sow. In the first half of June alone, Wu'an County carried water to sow more than 55,000 mu of cotton. In She County, with a large number of laborers participating in the war effort, wives and children worked together to carry water and plant more than 7,200 mu of cotton and corn in two or three days in twenty-three villages. In the fight against drought, water conservancy activities were widely carried out in the First and Fifth Districts. Wherever possible, the masses made all-out efforts to build canals, dig wells, and excavate ponds. In Xingtai and other places, through the painstaking creation and all-out efforts of the masses, water conservancy projects that were historically considered impossible were successfully completed. When the seedlings emerged, the severe drought had not yet ended, and various places organized seedling protection campaigns. Zuoquan and other counties proposed "saving seedlings is like saving lives, saving one counts as one," and urged people to fill gaps [the Chinese characters here are unreadable], and catch pests. For example, a labor hero in Xingtai called on each laborer to guarantee watering half a mu of seedlings. In order to save water and resist drought, many counties adopted the method of irrigating through sorghum stalks inserted into the ground. They painstakingly rescued the seedlings one by one under the scorching sun. More than 900 people in Chengguan, She County, turned out to complete the surrounding of soil and covering of seedlings on more than 150 mu of small seedlings in half a day. In Zuoquan, villagers near the river rescued crops with buckets and dippers, with each person averaging half a mu of land watered per day. In addition, various places generally implemented the call for more hoeing and fine hoeing. In the driest areas such as Lin County and Wu'an, after the seedlings emerged, they were killed by the drought, and the masses began to replant. Some planted and were killed by drought again, and the masses planted again, with some sowing as many as three times. In terms of conservation, the masses have a high degree of trust in the Communist Party and the democratic government. After various places called for conservation to prepare for famine, the masses immediately consciously made plans to lower their living standards. Some publicly formulated village covenants to determine living standards. In He Shun, Yu She, and Xiyang counties in the Second District, tobacco and alcohol have no market. The masses in She County have been picking persimmons, grinding cotton seeds, and collecting a large amount of substitute food everywhere. After the summer harvest in Lin County, wheat is exchanged for rice, and very few people eat wheat. The masses in various places are convinced that as long as they are organized to produce and help themselves, they can definitely overcome the disaster.

    【Report from This Newspaper in Xiyang】Since the beginning of spring, the whole county has suffered from severe drought. Under extremely difficult conditions, the masses have helped each other to plant and hoe, achieving great results. In terms of hoeing seedlings: Labor heroes in various villages took the lead and put forward slogans such as "Hoeing brings rain," "Black beans wearing yellow shirts are better than wearing a small cloth shirt," "More hoeing and more gathering, fewer clods in the autumn plowing, and weeds can be removed," and "Hoeing in dry weather is better earlier than later." These slogans mobilized the masses. From the current point of view, most of the crops have been hoeed three times, or are being hoeed intensively. Of the 29,306 mu of miscellaneous fields in the Fourth District, 25,792 mu have been hoeed three times. Secondly, in order to prevent drought and make up for the shortcomings in cultivation during sowing this spring, various places have universally carried out topdressing, ensuring universal topdressing for miscellaneous fields, and partial topdressing for grain fields, with each mu receiving 5 to 15 loads of manure. Dongguan proposed: "Topdressing now will lead to more grain in the autumn." The method in Beihengshan is: "One load of manure with three loads of water, one bowl per corn plant, so that not only can the seedlings grow, but the crops are also fertile and drought-resistant." The masses acted quickly. Of the 29,306 mu of miscellaneous fields in the Fourth District, 7,998 mu have already been topdressed, and intensive topdressing is underway. In the course of the action, education on the benefits of topdressing and specific calculations were carried out (Li Maxiao of Xigubi topdressed half a mu, and yielded one more dou, with each dou weighing one more jin). The community swept up cooking ashes, dismantled pit soil, dug up wasteland soil, smoked soil, swept the streets, and padded pigpens, solving the problem of some people thinking that topdressing inferior land was not worthwhile and lacking manure. In the drought resistance campaign, canal construction and land reclamation were also carried out. The three villages of Wangzhai, Sanjiaohe, and Heshang alone opened six canals, irrigating 102 mu of land. The Sixth District has reclaimed 1,002 mu of wasteland and 1,198 mu of cultivated wasteland, preparing to sow vegetables and plant buckwheat. Xidajie organized the return of labor for digging ancient tombs in conjunction with solving the problem of equivalent value and work-study, with each person guaranteeing the opening of two fen of vegetable land.

    太行灾区翻身农民顽强抗旱三次下种
    【本报特讯】太行自入春以来，大部分地区缺雨，旱灾严重，但在共产党及民主政府领导与帮助下，灾区翻身农民高度发扬了战胜灾荒的卓绝精神，此种精神为历史上所未有。谷雨以后，各地群众纷纷组织起来，担水点种，凡能动的男女老少都卷入抢种运动。武安一县在六月上半月内，即担水点种棉花五万五千余亩。涉县二十三个村在劳力大批参战情况下，老婆娃娃一齐动手，两三天内即担水点棉花、玉茭七千二百余亩。在抗旱斗争中，一、五分区普遍开展水利活动，凡有可能，群众即全力突击修渠、打井、挖池。邢台等地，在群众苦心创造与全力突击下，将历史上认为不可能完成的水利工程建设成功。小苗出土，酷旱未已，各地又组织了保苗运动，左权等县提出救苗如救命，救活一棵算一棵，打＠＠，捉害虫。如邢台劳动英雄号召每一劳动力保证浇活半亩苗，为了省水耐旱，许多县份均采用高粱杆插空灌水的办法，在炎日下费尽心机的一棵一棵的抢救。涉县城关九百余人，一齐出动，半天内完成小苗围土，盖苗一百五十余亩。左权沿河近水村庄，全村老乡，一桶一杓的抢救庄稼，每人每天平均浇半亩地。此外各地普遍执行了多锄细锄的号召，林县、武安等最旱地区，小苗出土后被旱死，群众又动手再种，有的种上又旱死，群众又种上，有的下种达三次之多。在节约方面，群众对共产党与民主政府有高度信赖，自各地号召节约备荒后，群众马上自觉的订了计划，降低生活水平，有的公订村公约，确定生活标准。二分区和顺、榆社、昔阳等县，烟酒已无销路。涉县群众已到处拾柿柠，碾棉籽，大量采积代食品。林县夏收后，均以小麦换米，食麦者很少。各地群众确信，只要组织起来生产自救，一定可以战胜灾荒。（毓明）
    【本报昔阳讯】全县入春苦旱，群众在极端困难条件下，互助点种抢锄，获得很大成绩。锄苗方面：各村劳英带头，提出了“锄头有雨”、“黑豆穿黄衫，赶一小布衫”，“多锄多搂，秋天耕地圪垃少，还能去了宿根草”，“天旱锄田，赶前不赶后”等口号，调动了群众，从现在看大部庄稼都已锄了三遍，或正在突击。四区杂田二万九千三百零六亩，已锄三遍的二万五千七百九十二亩。其次为了防旱与弥补今春下种在耕作上的不足，各地普遍开展了抓青，保证杂田普抓，谷田部分的也抓，每亩上粪均在五至十五担。东关提出：“现在多抓一把青，秋后多打一把粮”。北横山的办法是：“大粪一担水三担，每根玉茭上一碗，这样不但能发苗，庄稼又肥又耐旱”。群众行动的很快，四区杂田二万九千三百零六亩，现已抓青七千九百九十八亩，正在突击。在行动中作了抓青的利益教育与具体算帐（西固壁李马小抓青半亩，多打一斗，每斗多一斤。）进行了扫曲灰、拆坑土、刨荒土、熏熏土、扫街、垫圈等，解决了部分群众认为劣地抓青不占与没粪思想。在抗旱运动中，并进行了开渠开荒，仅王寨、三交河、河上三村开渠六道，浇地一百零二亩。六区已开出生荒一千零二亩，熟荒一千一百九十八亩准备撒菜、种荞麦。西大街结合解决等价问题与勤工问题，组织了还工开古坟，每口人保证开菜地二分。
