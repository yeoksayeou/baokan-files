    Seize the Key Point of Beiliu for Inspection
    Promote the Elimination of Wasteland in All Villages
    [Our Newspaper] After inspection, Beiliu in Licheng created experience to promote the rapid development of the supplementary planting and vegetable sowing movement in the entire key area. In the space of a welcome rain in Beiliu Village, one representative from each group organized four groups to inspect sowing and weeding, and found the following problems: the whole village still has 54.8 mu of bare land (including 5 mu of orchard land, not distributed to farmers, the land is far away and bad), 32 mu of pit land, 30 mu of corn not hoed for the first time, 9.2 mu of peanuts, and 9 mu of millet. The corn in Liu Naisheng's group is already as tall as a thigh, but the fertilizer is still piled up, and the stones on the embankments have not been carried. There are also 118.6 mu of wheat land that has not been plowed for the first time. An immediate meeting of the mutual aid brigade was held to discuss and study, and the following reasons were found: The emancipated peasants believe that they have good land to plant, so they despise and do not plant bad land. In addition, the high price of drought makes them unsure if they will harvest after planting. The current wages are high, and they have no confidence in deep plowing and careful cultivation, so they might as well not plant. For example, Li Shoucheng said, "I only want to plant one season on this land for two years, and I don't want to fertilize it even if I have it." The leadership promptly discussed with everyone, what is the purpose of planting land? Does the land support people or do people support the land? Who benefits from higher wages? After everyone calculated the accounts, they unified and lowered wages (from seven catties to five catties), and at the same time proposed that the main thing is to exchange labor for labor. If a small balance is owed, it will be paid in equivalent value in the fall. During the discussion on eliminating bare land, the emancipated peasants Liu Shiqing and Liu Zhongjing of Xinying put forward the slogan "We relied entirely on reclaiming wasteland to save our lives during the disaster in 1943. Don't look down on small and sloping land. Sowing autumn vegetables is better than bran," which moved the emancipated peasants. Zhang Lisheng said, "That's right! If the Communist Party hadn't led us to reclaim slopes and sow vegetables in '42 and '43, we would have long been mixed with the soil." This encouraged the determination to completely eliminate bare land, leaving no inch of land uncultivated, and overcame Liu Shoucheng's idea of planting only one season every two years and looking down on planting bad land. Labor hero Li Choulou proposed: Although it has rained, no rice has fallen. The ancients said, "People can still starve to death under the ears of grain." Thrift should be implemented throughout the year to ensure the realization of the original weeding plan. Technically, we must achieve deep plowing and careful cultivation. He put forward the slogan: "Strive to get the seed drill back in May, and work even harder in June. Three early stages add one work day, and women and children are of great use." Everyone unanimously discussed and responded to the hero's call. Women carried water, delivered meals, and repaired peanut seedlings, sowing on slopes, and men rushed to plant, hoe twice, top-dress, and plow wheat fields. The leadership held a half-day meeting of the political directors and district cadres of all nine villages in the entire key area on the second day to introduce the experience of Beiliu. After discussion, everyone rushed back with great enthusiasm, and within three days, the entire key area sowed 1,032 mu of vegetables (including sloping land), completely eliminating bare land. A plan was made for everyone to strive to make a great contribution in weeding, and it is being carried out in full swing. (Pei Yi, Huan Qing)

    北流基点抓紧检查
    推动各村消灭荒地
    【本报讯】黎城北流经过检查，创造经验推动全基点迅速开展补种撒菜运动。北流村在喜雨降透的空间，每组出席代表一人，组织了四个小组，检查下种锄苗，查出以下问题：全村仍有白地五十四亩八分（内有果实地五亩，未分到农民手里，地远且坏）窟窿地三十二亩，未锄头遍玉茭三十亩，花九亩二分，谷九亩。刘乃生组玉茭长的已有大腿高，肥仍然堆着，地堰的石头也未担，还有麦地一百十八亩六分未犁头遍。当即召开互助大队研究讨论，发现以下原因：翻身农民认为有了好地种，对歹地轻视不种，加上天旱不雨等价高，种上收不收还不保险，眼前工资又高，深耕细作也没信心，还不如不种。如李守成说：“我这地二年只想种一季，有肥也不想上地。”领导上及时和大家研究，种地为着啥？是地养人还是人养地？工资大了好过谁啦？大家算了一下帐，统一降低工资（由七斤降到五斤），同时提出主要是工变工，如欠小数尾巴，秋后交等价。在讨论消灭白地时，翻身农民刘士清，新英刘仲景提出“四三年遭灾荒，救命全靠咱开荒，小地坡地不要看不起，撒上秋菜比糠强”的口号，感动了翻身农民，张里生说：“就是呀！四二、四三不是共产党领导咱开坡撒菜，咱早和土混啦。”鼓舞了自动提出彻底消灭白地，不留一分地的决心，克服了刘守成二年种一季看不起种歹地思想。劳英李丑犊提出：天虽下了雨，没有下来米，古人说：“谷穗底下还要饿死人”，节约应贯彻全年，保证实现原订锄苗计划，在技术上，一定要做到深耕细作，他提出口号：“五月争回耧，六月抢种更加油，三早增一工，妇女儿童顶大用”，全体一致讨论响应英雄号召，妇女担水送饭修理花苗，撒坡地，男人抢种，锄二锄，上追肥，耕麦地。领导上第二日就召开全基点九个村政治主任及区干部半天会议，介绍北流经验，经讨论后，大家一股热气连忙跑回去，三天内全基点共撒菜一千零三十二亩（坡地在内），彻底消灭了白地。订出计划人人在锄苗中要争取立一大功，正在热火朝天的进行。（培义、浣清）
