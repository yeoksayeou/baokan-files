　　Xinhua News Agency, Liaodong, 14th—Andong's light industry is rapidly recovering. Andong has 2,600 spindles and more than 70 factories. The textile industry was once famous throughout the country, but it was devastated during the Chiang occupation, and all factories closed down. Now, more than 40 companies, including Fuyu Yong and Yongmao Xiang, have resumed operations, with more than 800 machines starting to run. They produce more than 1,000 bolts of cloth every day. The Andong Textile Factory produces more than 1,500 catties of yarn every day. The Zhonghua Textile Factory completed its planned 9,600 catties of cotton yarn in July as scheduled. Each yarn machine in the factory originally produced more than 70 catties of yarn per day, but this has increased to 230 catties at the beginning of this month. According to preliminary investigations, the output of the spinning group has exceeded the highest record during the puppet Manchukuo period by more than 35 percent, and the cotton manufacturing group has exceeded it by more than 10 percent. The power group saved 15 tons of coal in July. Seven paper mills, including Tongyi Yong, have started operations, producing more than 50 reams of paper per day. The famous Yalu River Paper Mill will also resume operations next month. In addition, more than 50 garment factories, cotton factories, and iron factories have all resumed operations. The Mudanjiang Shipyard and dye factories such as Da Lü and Yu He have also successively started operations.
　　Xinhua News Agency, Northeast, 14th—The Nenjiang Textile Factory has increased its output more than tenfold from its resumption of work last October to this May. When the factory resumed work, it could only spin 170 catties of yarn and weave 71 bolts of cloth per month. In May of this year, it could spin 9,076 catties of yarn and weave 736 bolts of cloth. The output is still continuing to increase. Under the slogan of combining workers' production increases with improved treatment, the factory first established a comparison table of the output of each machine and announced each person's production results daily to encourage workers' enthusiasm for production. The amount of cloth woven increased from 10 bolts to 15 bolts per day. After the implementation of piece-rate wages and the establishment of a planned production system, it further increased to 25 to 30 bolts. Workers and technicians have also made great innovations in technology, using pressure road mechanisms to create pneumatic machines, and using various transmission methods to solve the factory's power problems; they used discarded parts to create a power warping machine, ensuring the supply of light shafts and greatly improving the quality. Also: In Yanji City, a famous industrial and commercial town in Jilin, liberated women enthusiastically participate in textile work. Last month, the city held a women's textile competition, with 520 skilled spinners starting their machines at the same time. The masses attending the meeting unanimously agreed that it was a spectacular sight since the liberation of Yanji. In the past two weeks, the number of women students who have registered for the "Spinning Training Institute" has reached 3,000.

　　安东轻工业纷纷恢复与蒋占期间迥然不同
    【新华社辽东十四日电】安东市轻工业，纷纷复业。安东共有二千六百台纺机，七十余厂。纺织业早驰名全国，但在蒋占期间横遭摧残，全部倒闭，现则有福裕永、永茂祥等四十余家已复业，八百余台机器开始转动。每天出布一千余匹。安东纺织厂每天出纱一千五百斤。中华纺织厂七月份已如期完成九千六百斤棉线计划。该厂纱线机每台每日原出线七十余斤，本月初则增至二百三十斤。据初步调查，纺纱组生产量较伪满时期最高纪录已超过百分之三十五，制棉组超过百分之十。动力组七月份节省煤十五吨。造纸业有同义永等七家开工，每日可出纸五十余令，著名的鸭绿江造纸厂亦将于下月复工。此外被服厂、棉花工厂、铁工厂等五十余家已全部复业，牡丹江造船厂与大吕、裕合等染厂亦均相继开工。
    【新华社东北十四日电】嫩江纺织厂自去年十月复工，至今年五月产量提高十倍以上。该厂在复工时，每月仅能纺纱一百七十斤，织布七十一匹，今年五月则可纺纱九千零七十六斤，织布七百三十六匹，产量仍继续提高中。该厂在工人增产竞赛与改善待遇相结合的口号下，首先建立各机产量比较表，每日公布各人生产成绩，鼓励工人生产热情，织布量由每日十匹提高到十五匹，实行计件工资及制定计划生产制后，又提高到二十五匹至三十匹。工人和技师们在技术上并有很大创造，利用压道机构造成气力机，用种种传动方法解决了工厂动力问题；用废弃的机件作成了一架动力整经机，保证了轻轴的供给。使品质大大提高。又：吉林著名工商重镇延吉市，翻身妇女热烈参加纺织，上月全市举行妇女纺织竞赛大会，五百二十个熟练纺手同时开动机车。与会群众一致认为延市解放以来之壮观。近两周来前往“纺纱传习所”报名妇女学员已达三千人。
