Xinhua News Agency, Jinji-Luyu, 5th Urgent Telegram: Chiang Kai-shek's planes are frenziedly bombing the Zhong＠dui (formerly mistakenly reported as Zhong＠dui) dangerous work site in Yuncheng County, round the clock, with each sortie involving two or three planes. When the water level rose by two meters on August 2nd, and the Yellow River experienced a breach, Chiang's planes became even more frantic, obstructing our disaster relief efforts. At night, Chiang's planes used a large number of flares to search for disaster relief workers. On the night of the 4th, the sound of planes and explosions never ceased, and as of this morning when the telegram was sent, bombing was still ongoing, the situation is extremely serious. Furthermore, according to delayed news: on the morning of July 30th, the Yangji dangerous work site on the south bank of Shou Zhang experienced a problem, with two meters of the dam head and dam foundation being washed away by the flood. As the engineering team and laborers were rushing to the rescue, two Chiang's planes suddenly appeared from the southwest, flying low and firing wildly, and dropping three bombs. On the afternoon of that day and the following morning, two Chiang's planes returned to bomb and strafe in turns, and the disaster relief project suffered setbacks.

Xinhua News Agency, Shandong, 5th Telegram: (Delayed) On July 24th, an American-made Chiang's plane attacked the Putai and Daoxu dangerous work sites again, dropping many incendiary bombs, burning all of the 300,000 catties of straw that the people along the river had painstakingly collected. From July 6th to 24th, Chiang's planes repeatedly bombed the Bohai Yellow River embankment. According to incomplete statistics from the Putai to Qidong section alone, there were as many as 33 sorties, resulting in the death or injury of ten Yellow River management workers, sixty livestock, and the destruction of more than 30 civilian houses and more than 300,000 catties of straw. Furthermore, it is reported that the party, government, army and people of all counties along the river in the Bohai area are currently following the regulations set by the Shandong Provincial River Affairs Bureau at the river management project meeting last month to strengthen flood prevention measures. Section chiefs are urging each engineering team to patrol the dangerous work sites day and night. There are sentry posts every five li along the dam, and a flood prevention team is stationed at each dangerous work site to strengthen the defense of the river, and strictly prevent sabotage by Chiang's special agents. In villages within five to ten li along the river, all men over the age of sixteen take turns on guard during normal times, and when the embankment is in danger, they all participate in the rescue and repair efforts.
