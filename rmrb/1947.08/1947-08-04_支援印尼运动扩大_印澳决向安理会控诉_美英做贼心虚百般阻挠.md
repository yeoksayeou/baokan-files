Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, August 31st: Comprehensive reports: The global movement to support Indonesia continues to expand. Dutch steel and lumber workers have launched sympathy strikes. On the 28th, an unprecedented demonstration of ten thousand people took place in Amsterdam, protesting the current government's war of aggression. It is reported that British workers have already begun to take action. The Birmingham Trades Council will appeal to the British Trades Union Congress and Members of Parliament, and consider convening a national executive committee of trade unions to discuss banning the export of materials that could be used for military purposes against Indonesia. The Secretariat of the World Federation of Trade Unions will soon write to UN Secretary-General Lie, urging him to press the Netherlands to cease its military operations against Indonesia. The Australian government instructed its delegation to the United Nations on the 30th to submit the Indonesian issue to the Security Council, demanding action to stop the Netherlands from undermining peace. Nehru declared on the 29th that India also intends to file a complaint with the Security Council on behalf of Indonesia. Canadian Social Democratic Party leader Caldwell recently stated, calling on the Canadian government to immediately submit the Indonesian issue to the Security Council for handling. He said: "The war in Java has created a dangerous situation in the Far East."

Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, August 31st: Chicago Sun reporter Gu He reported: "The United States and Britain are currently exchanging secret documents, discussing the possibility of various small countries submitting the Indonesian issue to the United Nations." Gu He asserted that Britain had twice sent notes to Australia, responding to Australia's suggestion that the Security Council should come forward to resolve Dutch-Indonesian relations, saying: "Australia's attitude is too pro-Indonesian," and stated that "if Washington and London decide to adopt this attitude, they would welcome Australia's participation." Gu He revealed that the US and Britain are discussing the Indonesian issue, adopting a policy of "dragging," so that the Netherlands can buy time to successively transport reinforcements to Indonesia. After India decided to file a complaint with the United Nations on behalf of Indonesia, the British Foreign Office has drafted an instruction to the British representative to the Security Council. According to Agence France-Presse, London: Britain's attitude still hopes that the Netherlands and Indonesia will accept Anglo-American "arbitration."

    【新华社陕北三十一日电】芝加哥太阳报记者古赫报导称：“美英两国现正交换秘密文件，讨论各小国将印尼问题交联合国的可能性”。古赫断言，英国曾两次向澳国致送照会，答复澳国希望安理会出面解决印荷关系之建议称：“澳国态度太亲印尼了”，并表示“若华盛顿与伦敦决定采取此种态度，当欢迎澳国参加”。古赫透露，美英讨论印尼问题，采取“拖”的政策，以便荷兰能争取时间陆续运送援军赴印尼。印度决定代表印尼向联合国提出控诉后，英外交部已草拟一训令致英驻安会代表。据法新闻处伦敦讯：英国的态度仍希望印荷接受英美“仲裁”。
