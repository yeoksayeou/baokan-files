　　Good Wartime Support Prepared in Advance
　　Feicheng Third District Praised by Prefectural Committee
　　[Our Newspaper, Ji-Lu-Yu, 16th] The emancipated peasants of the Third District of Feicheng, Tai'an West, enthusiastically support the front lines, guarantee all material supplies for the main forces, and give the troops great spiritual encouragement. For this, they have been praised by the Prefectural Committee, which has issued a circular to all districts to learn from them. Many villages in the Third District have organized military-civilian cooperative societies to supply the troops with the necessary vegetables, pork, oil, salt, etc. Before the troops arrived, each village had prepared houses and food. Many villagers hung small flags at their doors and set out boiled water. When the troops arrived, they offered eggs, vegetables, and pork to comfort them. The children's corps shouted welcome slogans. An eighty-year-old woman voluntarily boiled eight pots of water in the morning. When the district received the task of providing eighty stretchers, 200,000 catties of white flour, and 4,000 pairs of military shoes, the cadres of the entire district set off in the rain to immediately make arrangements. In just one morning, the eighty stretchers were organized and sent to the county. Within three days, the military shoes and white flour were also successfully completed. Therefore, when the troops arrived in the Third District, they highly praised the Third District's work in supporting the front and supporting the army.
　　[Our Newspaper, Ji-Lu-Yu, 16th] The Hou Dongzhuang Village cadres of Yunju County studied and resolved the contradiction between wartime support, re-examination, and production by using a division of labor and responsibility method. The village provided ten stretchers with eighty people, and ten carts with thirty people. In addition to wartime support, the remaining people hoed the fields at home, a total of eighty-three people, led by the captain Dong Jintang. They hoed 180 mu in two half-days, hoeing all the land of the participants and those without labor. When hoeing, the groups competed with each other, and their emotions were extremely high. After hoeing each mu of land, the production committee checked and commented, and those who did well were credited. Women and children carried out property investigation work, recovering grain, silver dollars, clothes, etc., worth more than two million yuan. At present, the village is preparing to distribute the floating wealth and hoe the second time, so men, women, old and young are all beaming with joy.

　　事前有准备战勤做得好
  　地委表扬肥城三区
    【本报冀鲁豫十六日电】泰西肥城三区翻身农民，热烈支援前线，保证主力军的一切物质供给，并给部队精神上很大振奋，为此受到地委表扬，通令各区向其学习。三区不少村庄，组织了军民合作社，供给部队所需之蔬菜、猪肉、油、盐等。部队未到前，各村都已准备好房子和粮食，不少村家门口都挂着小旗，摆着开水，当部队到达，纷纷拿鸡子青菜猪肉等来慰劳，儿童团高呼着欢迎的口号，一个八十多岁的老太太，一上午自动烧了八锅开水，当该区接到八十付担架、二十万斤白面、四千双军鞋的任务时，全区干部冒雨出发，立即布置，仅仅一上午的工夫，八十付担架有组织的到了县里；在三天内，军鞋和白面亦均胜利完成，所以部队一到三区，对三区的支前拥军工作，备极赞誉。
    【本报冀鲁豫十六日电】郓钜县后董庄村干会研究，用分工负责办法，解决了战勤、复查、生产的矛盾。该村出担架十付八十人，大车十辆三十人，除战勤以外，其余在家锄地，共八十三人，由队长董纪汤率领，两晌锄完一百八十亩，把参战人及无劳力的地，全部锄完了。在锄地时，组与组互相竞赛，情绪极高，每锄完一亩地，即由生产委员检查评议，好的记功。妇女儿童则进行查财工作，共追出粮食银元衣服等，约值二百多万元。目前该村准备一边分浮财，一边锄二遍，因此男女老少，无不喜形于色。
