How Poor and Hired Peasants Unite with Middle Peasants in Mutual Aid Production
    Li Zhuang

    After visiting and researching some mutual aid groups in the Shahe New District, I deeply realized that uniting middle peasants with poor and hired peasants as the backbone is the most important key to doing a good job in the new district's mutual aid and production movement.

    Mutual aid in the new district is now quite common, but except for a few that are doing well, most have some problems. Some are involuntary. During the busiest times of farming, a large number of people are mobilized to organize, which can play a considerable role in rushing to sow or hoe seedlings, but because the masses do not yet fully understand the benefits of mutual aid, they often feel unfree and restricted, forming involuntariness. Some are unequal in value. There are two reasons for this: First, the masses in the new district do not know how to calculate work points and convert work. The peasants who have been liberated still feel a lack of livestock and farm tools. Some of them, who are less aware, want to take advantage of others in mutual aid to solve their own difficulties, and they seek out old middle peasants. The old middle peasants, who have ideological concerns, also actively let them take some advantage in order to "maintain" the relationship. These people thus create inequality. Some cadres have an undemocratic work style. Some masses with poor awareness, after becoming cadres themselves, have the wrong idea of being ashamed of labor. They also participate in mutual aid groups, but are unwilling to actually labor, using the excuse of being busy with work to let others plant for them. Another problem is that old middle peasants have ideological concerns, wanting to get rich but not daring to get rich, and are perfunctory and irresponsible in production and mutual aid, deceiving themselves.

    After the land reform, the liberated peasants had the possibility and conditions to start a family and build a career, and the demand for production and getting rich became very urgent. Only a very small number of people with low class consciousness waste the fruits of their labor and want to eat from the big pot. Old middle peasants also have the basic desire to produce and get rich. The fact that some middle peasants in the mutual aid group would rather let the liberated peasants take some advantage, hoping that they would get rich quickly and surpass themselves, and then find ways to catch up with them, is a reflection of this idea. This is because they have some misconceptions about the struggle (equal distribution) at play. There are two criteria for judging whether middle peasants have concerns: First, see if they are actively engaged in production. Second, see if they are thrifty. Those who are actively engaged in production but eat and drink lavishly, and those who are diligently thrifty but hesitant about production, are basically wanting to get rich, but their thinking is confused.

    After the land reform, village cadres (mostly hired and poor peasants) and liberated peasants have the greatest say in the countryside. All classes are watching them. Their every move has the greatest impact on all classes, especially the middle peasants. They are the backbone of all work in the village, and production is no exception.

    What role should they play? In a word, they should lead by example and be role models.

    In the Shahe New District, the villages with the best production and the most united mutual aid groups all have honest poor and hired peasants as the backbone. Honest poor and hired peasants know best the hardships of life in the past, and today the demand for production and getting rich is the most urgent. They are the most active in production and are also models in thrift. They are especially kind and do not want to take advantage of anyone. They trust the leadership the most and are good at listening to the government. These characteristics are enough to unite middle peasants to organize mutual aid production and thrift.

    The first step in uniting middle peasants to produce and participate in mutual aid is to dispel their misconceptions about "struggle" and awaken their basic desire to produce and get rich. The most powerful method is for the poor and hired peasants to educate them with facts. Zhang Laiquan, the leader of the eighth group in Xinzhang, worked hard for half his life before liberation. After liberation, he worked hard to produce and save money in every way. He often told the middle peasants about his past painful life and explained his understanding of production and getting rich. The middle peasants said, "That's right! If we still have to struggle after working hard, why would he suffer like that?" Many cadres in the village are models of production and thrift, which gives the middle peasants another understanding: "It doesn't matter, the cadres are still doing it this way. They know everything first, so don't worry!" Chang Laochun, a liberated peasant, harvested 15 *shi* of grain and 400 *jin* of cotton last autumn from the newly distributed land, but he quickly wasted it all. The village cadres educated him, with the participation of middle peasants, saying, "After being liberated, production is for yourself, no one will ask you for it; starving is also your own business, no one will constantly help you." After the education, they lent him some grain to let him produce. The middle peasants all put down their fearful hearts.

    To achieve voluntariness, there must be two conditions: First, a real understanding of the benefits of mutual aid, and second, compatibility of minds. In the new district, because the mutual aid groups are organized, the peasants, especially the middle peasants, do not understand the benefits of mutual aid and treat it from the point of view of completing tasks, so they are perfunctory. Many consolidated mutual aid groups are organized by awakened and honest poor and hired peasants themselves, to show everyone what it looks like. When the middle peasants see that it is truly beneficial, they will voluntarily participate. Middle peasants have particularly many doubts. When using livestock to help each other with transportation, they are always worried that their livestock will exert more effort and eat less feed; when hoeing, they are afraid that others will break their hoes. Honest poor and hired peasants are known for their loyalty and kindness. It is easiest to gain the trust of the other party when they come forward to unite middle peasants to participate in mutual aid. After the land reform, middle peasants often become suspicious and are most afraid of being stimulated; it is easier for them to be relaxed and happy in spirit when they cooperate with honest poor and hired peasants. In many villages, there are cases where middle peasants specifically seek out certain honest poor and hired peasants to help each other, which is the best example.

    There are often two reasons why equal value is not done well: First, individual liberated peasants want to take advantage of the middle peasants, such as Hu Jiux from Baicuo Village, who owed the middle peasants 80 *jin* of wages and rice and did not pay them, which caused the mutual aid group to collapse. Second, when the liberated peasants were liberated, they emphasized "all peasants in the world are one family" and had a high degree of class consciousness. At first, they all wanted to be generous in mutual aid. When the deputy secretary of a village was hoeing the seedlings, he thought, "The earlier the first hoeing, the greater the impact on the harvest. Let's set an example!" With good intentions, he mobilized everyone to hoe for others first and then for themselves; the wages for hoeing first were high, and he earned more from others; when he hoed for himself, the wages were low, so of course he paid others less; as a result, everyone said that he intentionally took advantage of them, and no one was satisfied. Some people also think that it is too petty to calculate carefully, so let's be careless! Mutual aid like this will never be consolidated if it continues to develop. Honest poor and hired peasants have different views. In mutual aid, they emphasize fairness and seriousness. "Mutual aid is good for everyone, no one should take advantage, and no one should suffer." If they organize others with this opinion, they will first get the approval of the middle peasants. After the poor and hired peasants put forward this principle, the middle peasants often supplement many opinions on the details, gradually achieving fairness and rationality. If the poor and hired peasants do not put forward this principle first, the middle peasants will not dare to put forward opinions or will be unwilling to put forward opinions.

    Cadres treating the opinions of middle peasants democratically and equally is a great encouragement to the middle peasants. Now middle peasants are afraid of being discriminated against in the village. As soon as they have this feeling, it will immediately be reflected in their production mood. If cadres democratically solicit the opinions of the masses and treat the middle and poor peasants with the same sincerity and kindness, the middle peasants will feel that they are one family with them and dare to say anything, and their enthusiasm for production will be great; and only by making the middle peasants dare to speak can cadres or poor and hired peasants easily understand their specific ideological problems and effectively educate and help them.

　　贫雇怎样团结中农互助生产
    李庄
    访问与研究了沙河新区一些互助组，深深体会到以贫雇为骨干团结中农是搞好新区互助与生产运动最重要的关键。
    新区互助现在相当普遍，但除少数搞得好的以外，大部都存在着一些问题。有的是不自愿，在农事最紧时，号召大量组织起来，对突击下种或锄苗也能起相当作用，但因群众还不很了解互助的好处，常常感觉不自由拘束，形成不自愿。有的是不等价，原因有两个：一、新区群众不会计工折工，翻身户现在仍感牲口农具缺乏，其中一些觉悟较差的想在互助中占别人一些便宜，解决自己这些困难，对象找到老中农。老中农思想上有顾虑的，也主动让他占些便宜，以便“维持”。这些人于是造成不等价。有的是干部作风不民主，有些觉悟差的群众在自己当了干部后，就产生以劳动为耻的错误想法，他们自己也参加互助组，却不愿实际劳动，借口工作忙，让别人给自己代种。还有一个是老中农思想有顾虑，想发家而不敢发家，在生产与互助中敷衍塞责，自己骗自己。
    土地改革后，翻身户有了成家立业的可能与条件，生产发家的要求非常迫切了，只有极个别阶级觉悟较低的浪费果实，想吃大锅饭。老中农同样有生产发家的基本要求。部分中农在互助组中，宁愿让翻身户占些便宜，希望他们赶快发家，超过自己，自己再设法赶上他们，就是这种思想的反映。这是由于他们对斗争有些错觉（均产）在作怪。判断中农有无顾虑有两个标准：一、看他是否积极生产。二、看他是否节约。积极生产而大吃大喝与努力节约而对生产迟疑的，都是基本上想发家，但思想糊涂的表现。
    土地改革后村干部（多为雇贫）和翻身户在乡村中有最大的发言权，各阶层的眼光都注视着他们。他们的一举一动，对于各阶层，特别是中农，具有最大的影响。他们是村中一切工作的骨干，生产也不例外。
    他们应该起些什么作用？一句话，应该以身作则，典型示范。
    沙河新区若干生产最好的村庄与团结最好的互助组，其中都是老实的贫雇在作骨干。老实贫雇最知道过去生活的艰难困苦，今天生产发家的要求最为迫切，在生产中最积极，在节约上也是模范。他们特别厚道，不想占任何人的便宜，最相信领导，善于听政府的话。这些特点，都足以团结中农组织互助生产节约。
    团结中农生产与参加互助的第一步，要打消他们对于“斗争”的错觉，把生产发家的基本要求唤起来。最有力的方法，是贫雇自己对他们进行事实教育。新掌第八组组长张来全，翻身前作了半辈子苦工，翻身后死命生产，多方节约，经常向中农叙述自己过去的痛苦生活，解释自己对生产发家的认识。中农们说：“对呀！要是自己劳动了还斗争，他这样死受为什么”？该村许多干部都是生产节约的模范，更给予中农一个认识：“不要紧，干部还这么搞哩，什么事情都是他们先知道，放心吧”！有个翻身户常老春，去秋新分的土地，打了十五石粮食四百斤棉花，很快就浪费光了。村干部对他进行教育，吸收中农参加，说翻了身，生产了是自己的，没人向你要；饿肚子也是自己的事，没有人成天救济你。”教育后借给他一些粮食，让他生产。中农听了都放下了那颗疑惧的心。
    要想作到自愿，必有两个条件：一是真正认识了互助好处，一是对心思。新区由于互助组是编起来的，农民特别是中农不了解互助的好处，以完成任务的观点对待它，于是敷衍应付。许多巩固的互助组，都是由觉悟的老实贫雇，自己先组织起来，作个样子给大家看看，中农看到真正有利，就自愿参加了。中农疑虑特别多，用牲口和别人互助运输，总耽心自己的牲口出的力多，吃的料少；锄地怕别人把自己的锄坏了。老实贫雇，以忠实厚道出名。他们出面去团结中农参加互助，最易取得对方信任。中农在土地改革后，常常疑神疑鬼，最怕刺激；和老实贫雇互助，精神容易轻松愉快。许多村庄，都有中农专找某些老实贫雇去互助的事实，就是最好的例子。
    等价作不好，常有两种原因：一、个别翻身户想占中农便宜，如白错村胡九×欠中农八十斤工资米不给，互助组因而垮了。二、翻身户在翻身时，强调“天下农民是一家”，阶级觉悟高了，最初都想在互助中涵厚些。某村副支书在锄头遍苗时，想道：“头遍锄的早晚，对收成关系最大，自己起模范吧”！他以一片好心，发动大家先锄别人的，后锄自己的；先锄的工资高，自己多挣了人家的，给自己锄时，工资低了，当然少给了人家；结果大家反说他有意占便宜，都不满意。也有些人认为细细算帐，显着小气，马虎点吧！这样的互助，发展下去绝不会巩固。老实贫雇的看法不同，他们在互助中，强调公道认真。“互助对大家都好，谁也别占便宜，谁也别吃亏。”以这种意见去组织别人，首先会得到中农的赞成。贫雇提出这个原则后，中农往往在细节上补充许多意见，逐渐作到公平合理。贫雇不先提，中农有意见也不敢提或不愿提。
    干部民主平等的对待中农的意见，对中农是一个大鼓励。现在中农生怕自己在村中受歧视，稍有这种感觉，马上就会反映在他的生产情绪上。干部民主多征求群众意见，对中贫农同样的诚恳和霭，中农就觉着和他们一家，有什么都敢说，生产劲头就大；也只有使中农敢说话，干部或贫雇才容易了解他们具体的思想症结，才能有效的教育与帮助。
