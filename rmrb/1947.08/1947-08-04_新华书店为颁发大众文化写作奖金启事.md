Xinhua Bookstore Announces Mass Culture Writing Awards

    The Propaganda Department of the CPC Jin-Ji-Lu-Yu Central Bureau has allocated 200,000 yuan, and our bookstore has added another 200,000 yuan, totaling 400,000 yuan, as writing awards. This is to reward outstanding works that promote the mass culture movement, to be published by our bookstore in the future. Because the people in our region have demonstrated boundless mass power, created infinitely rich lives, and produced countless heroic figures, vivid stories, and work innovations in the patriotic self-defense war, the emancipation movement, and the production movement. Consequently, the people's thoughts have changed, and the people's cultural demands have also increased. In order to reflect these magnificent realities and to meet the urgent demands of the people for ideological emancipation and cultural emancipation, the Propaganda Department of the Central Bureau has issued this call to encourage writing, and everyone will certainly respond enthusiastically. The methods for awarding this prize are stipulated as follows:

    1. From August to the end of December, all books initially published by our bookstore will be eligible for nomination. At the end of the year, our bookstore will select and submit them to the Propaganda Department of the Central Bureau for approval, and then announce the awards.

    2. The scope of works includes all aspects of cultural knowledge, whether literature, science, history, geography, application, current political affairs, ideological cultivation... etc. As long as the content can reflect reality, enlighten and educate the people, and have the effect of promoting work, and the writing skills are excellent, all are eligible for nomination and awards.

    3. Award-winning works will be given prizes in three grades: Grade A, 50,000 yuan; Grade B, 30,000 yuan; Grade C, 10,000 yuan. For particularly outstanding works, in addition to receiving awards according to the assessed grade, our bookstore may also issue special royalties of one yuan per word.

    4. After the books are published, the bookstore must be allowed to include them in various series published by our bookstore, such as the New Mass Series, the Mass Science Series, and the Literary Series.

    The work of developing the mass culture movement is urgent, and serving the people is glorious. All comrades in the cultural circles of our region are requested to send us your best works! We and the masses are eagerly awaiting them!
