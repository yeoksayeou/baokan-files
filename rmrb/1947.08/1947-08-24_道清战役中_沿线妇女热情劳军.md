During the Daoqing Campaign
Women Along the Route Enthusiastically Supported the Troops

[Our Newspaper, Northern Henan News] Since the counter-attack by our troops along the Daoqing Railway, the masses have been greatly encouraged. Not only have the men bravely participated in the war effort, carrying stretchers, but women and children have also been working tirelessly day and night, preparing white flour, vegetables, and other supplies. The masses near the Dan River, upon hearing that the army was coming down the mountain, automatically prepared to welcome them. Starting from July 4th, even before our army had captured Qinghua, the masses in areas like Jianglingbao and Zhangpo in Qinyang voluntarily wrote slogans, cleaned the streets and courtyards, and prepared large pots, white flour, rice porridge, and tea to welcome their own troops. In particular, the women in each village were waiting to provide hospitality, with tea set out in front of every house. Women in each village set up temporary reception stations. Women from the Huangling Alum Factory in Bo'ai, led by Wang Guihua, traveled fifteen *li* to Daxinzhuang at the foot of the mountain to take care of wounded soldiers. Their attentive care moved the Hui Muslim women in the new district of Daxinzhuang, who initially were shy and unwilling to help the wounded, to enthusiastically provide hospitality. More than 40 women from villages like Zhaihuo came voluntarily in a second group. An old military dependent, upon arriving at the station, rushed to feed the soldiers soup and rice, and wash clothes. The reception station in Shanwangzhuang, Qinyang, was very well organized, providing not only soup, water, eggs, and cigarettes, but also medicines. Forty women and children worked tirelessly day and night. Chen Xiuhua and Yuan Guihua, the chair and vice-chair of the Women's Rescue Association in Hantai, voluntarily cooperated with students and the elderly to set up five large pots, mobilizing women to boil rice soup, bean soup, and noodle soup to entertain the wounded and passing troops. They also prepared 320 eggs, making egg drop soup and egg pancakes, as well as pears and *zongzi*. The women either fed the wounded soldiers or gave them soup, working from early morning until past noon without eating or tiring. The masses in Xiaodong Village, Fourth District, Wuzhi, upon hearing that our army was going to attack the stubborn army (at Mudian), voluntarily organized women and children to set up a reception station for the wounded. A cool shed half a *li* long was set up on the street, and watermelons, eggs, and other items were prepared. Children fanned the wounded soldiers, and women fed them soup and rice. Qianxia Village, Third District, Xiuwu, was a no-man's land created by the stubborn army. When our army occupied Xiuwu City and the main force arrived at the village, there were initially very few people in the village. Under the leadership of the captain, the women voluntarily helped to boil water and cook food. They also voluntarily organized two stretchers, preparing to transfer the wounded. The captain said, "The women in our village have suffered greatly from those people (referring to the stubborn army), and they all want to quickly beat those bastards." When the women heard about carrying stretchers, they all rushed to go. In Sujiazuo Village, Fifth District, Bo'ai, a liberated woman named Dong Mengshi participated in the war effort. The village assigned her husband to carry stretchers, but he was ill and unable to go. She said to the cadres, "The Eighth Route Army saved my whole family and gave us land and houses. I will never forget this kindness. If he can't go, I can go!" Her stretcher team consisted of five people, and she was the only woman. Her job was to cook, and whenever they arrived at a place, she immediately looked for things to boil water and cook. Whenever she had time, she would actively sew and mend clothes and shoes for the porters. She often said, "The Eighth Route Army is fighting for us poor people, and the poor people should contribute. Family members should help each other, and doing a little work is nothing!" During the march, others wouldn't let her carry things, but she insisted on carrying them. She often carried about forty *jin* of white flour on her back, transferring with the army, never saying she was tired, whether it was day or night. Her name spread throughout the county's stretcher teams, and they all said, "Dong Mengshi is really good, truly a female hero!" (Zhipeng)
