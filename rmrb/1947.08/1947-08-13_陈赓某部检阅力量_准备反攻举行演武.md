　　【This Dispatch from Taiyue, 11th】 A certain brigade under General Chen Geng, in order to inspect the forces preparing for the great counter-offensive, held a large-scale military exercise on July 22nd. Each regiment selected heroes and model companies to participate. It started at 4:00 AM and ended at 6:00 PM. The results showed that a certain regiment performed the best. Their grenade throwing, machine gun, and mortar firing were all the best. In particular, the 6th squad of the mortar company hit the target three times out of three shots in direct firing. Hu Yurong, a medic from the 6th company, also threw a grenade 52 meters and was selected as the top grenade thrower in the entire brigade. In the field exercise, a certain regiment was ranked first. During the exercise, the company, platoon, and squad commanders of the 6th company of that regiment were flexible in command and quick in action, bravely erecting ladders and climbing them. Each person could climb a four-zhang (approximately 13 meters) high ladder in less than four minutes on average. Zhang Silai, a new soldier in the machine gun company of the 2nd battalion of that regiment, was able to hit the target five times out of five shots with a heavy machine gun within 200 meters. At the end of the military exercise, the brigade leaders called on everyone to continue to launch a military training campaign to improve combat skills, "not only to compete today, but also to compete on the battlefield."
