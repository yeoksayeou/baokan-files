　　Jincheng, Tunliu
  　Plowing Wasteland and Delivering Manure in Preparation for Wheat Planting
    [Our Taiyue Dispatch, 27th] Jincheng, Tunliu and other places are eliminating cultivated wasteland to expand wheat fields. The Second District of Jincheng convened a meeting of over 1,000 district and village cadres from 48 villages on the 13th of this month to arrange production work before the autumn harvest. After discussions in various large and small meetings, it was unanimously agreed that eliminating wasteland and expanding the wheat planting area is one of the current production focuses. According to statistics from the Second District, there are 20,000 mu of cultivated wasteland. Dongdayang and other twelve villages have reclaimed 6,833 mu, with Dongdayang achieving the best results, reclaiming 4,400 mu. The district currently has over 13,000 mu of wasteland remaining, and villages are now carrying out competitions to ensure that all wasteland is eliminated before Bailu (White Dew), and that the wheat field area in the entire district is expanded to 50% to 60%. On the 15th, after the cadres finished their meetings and returned to their villages, they immediately mobilized the masses to speed up wasteland reclamation, plow wheat fields, accumulate fertilizer, deliver manure, and prepare seeds. Yuwu Village in Tunliu had over 200 mu of wasteland, which has now been completely eliminated. The village has suffered damage from the enemy and puppets over the years, and many of its land was abandoned. After last year's reclamation, there were still 218 mu. Recently, with the joint efforts of 23 mutual aid groups, it has all been cleared within ten days. In particular, Miao Tianzui, a 68-year-old man from North Street, cleared 5 mu of wasteland alone. In addition to planting buckwheat on some of the reclaimed land, the rest has been plowed in preparation for wheat planting. After completing the third weeding of autumn seedlings, Cuiguo Village in the Fourth District of Tunliu immediately seized the slack farming season to reclaim wasteland. The village suffered a hailstorm this year, but the cadres and the masses were not discouraged. They unanimously proposed "Strive for an 80% harvest from a 50% harvest year", "Plant one more point of land, suffer one less point of hardship". Everyone organized themselves and competed to reclaim wasteland. The whole village had 330 mu of wasteland. In addition to the 280 mu reclaimed by individuals, the mutual aid groups collectively reclaimed 50 mu, preparing to use the harvested grain to invest in a flour mill as future village public expenditure. The whole village is now also cutting artemisia and composting manure on a large scale, preparing to apply it to the wheat fields.
    [Our Taiyue Dispatch, 27th] Changsheng Village in Qin County is stepping up the expansion of wheat fields and cutting artemisia to compost manure. From the 14th to the 21st, all 39 mutual aid groups and more than 320 women and children in the village were mobilized. Within ten days, they expanded the wheat field area by 194 mu (from an original 350 mu) and increased the planting of late vegetables by 35 mu (from an original 87 mu), averaging two mu of wheat and vegetable land per household. Each group has now set out a fertilization plan: 17 women's groups plan to cut 920 dan of artemisia; 22 men's groups plan to smoke a further 18,024 dan of fertilizer, so that each mu is fertilized with an average of 40 dan (four times more than before). The women also guarantee to make 5 jin of dried vegetables per person, make an extra 136 pairs of shoes for sale, and spin 222 jin of cotton. In this way, the whole village can increase production by 200 shi, which is enough to feed all 669 people in the village for two months.
