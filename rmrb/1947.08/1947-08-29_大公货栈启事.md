　　Dagong Warehouse Notice
　　This warehouse was previously ordered to close. Due to numerous procedures, it could not be finalized earlier. Now, we specifically declare again that all shops from various locations that have procedural relationships with this warehouse must bring their receipts for settlement before September 10th. Late submissions will be void, and we will not handle them. Thank you for your cooperation.
