　　Shahe Seizes Gaps in Weeding to Reclaim Wasteland, Accumulate Manure, and Prepare Wheat Seeds
　　[Report from our correspondent group on the 17th] Shahe's First and Second Districts are seizing the gaps in weeding to actively prepare for wheat planting this autumn. Three issues closely related to wheat planting are being progressively resolved. First, seeds: The soil in the First and Second Districts is poor, and wheat is very susceptible to smut. This year, many villages had no harvest at all due to smut. The district leadership has decided to exchange wheat seeds with other areas, and in the future, seeds will be exchanged annually. The district cooperative is currently negotiating with relevant parties to handle this. Second, fertilizer: This year, late seedlings will not be harvested until around the Cold Dew solar term, which will affect wheat planting. Increasing fertilizer can make the later wheat seedlings thrive and increase yields. The district leadership's campaign to cut artemisia to compost manure and develop sheep flocks has achieved considerable success. Third, wasteland reclamation: The First and Second Districts still have some wasteland. Reclaiming all of it can increase the wheat planting area. This land has been fallow for several years, and the soil is very fertile, but the grass is belly-deep, making reclamation difficult. Each village has been taking advantage of the gaps in weeding to organize manpower and livestock to plow the wasteland, plowing it two or three times while it is still damp to rot the grass, which will become the best wheat field.

　　沙河抓紧锄苗间隙开荒积粪准备麦种
    【本报记者团十七日电】沙河一、二区，抓紧锄苗间隙，积极准备今秋种麦，三个与种麦有密切关系的问题，正逐步解决。第一、种籽：一、二区地质不好，小麦最易生黑穗病，今年许多村庄，即因黑穗病完全未收。区领导方面，决定向其他区域调换麦种，以后每年换籽一次，区联社正向有关方面交涉办理。第二、肥料：今年晚苗要在寒露前后才能收割，影响种麦，增加肥料，可使较晚的麦苗茁壮，增加收成。区领导方面，发动的割蒿沤粪发展羊群运动，已获相当成绩。第三、恳荒：一、二区尚有若干荒地，为全部开恳出来，可增加种麦面积，这种土地休歇已经数年，地方蕴蓄甚丰，但是草深没腹，开垦甚难，各村已乘锄苗空隙，组织人畜力犁荒，趁伏地犁两三遍，把草沤烂，即成最好的麦田。（李庄）
