    Industrial and Mining Workers Show Great Enthusiasm for Saving and Increasing Production to Support the War
    Fengfeng Mining Area: Launching "Support the Front Lines Day" Campaign
    40 Million Yuan Contributed in Three Months
    [Reported by this newspaper] The support-the-front-lines movement in the Fengfeng Mining Area initially lacked organization and was drifting aimlessly. On March 28th, the leadership convened a general meeting of all employees, which unanimously approved the first day of each month as "Support the Front Lines Day." On this day, those participating in production worked entirely on a voluntary basis, and the materials consumed by the factory in production were also used to support the front lines. All the coal produced on this day was sold, and the proceeds were used as funds to support the front lines.
    The workers enthusiastically implemented their decision, saying unanimously: "We will not stop supporting the front lines until Chiang Kai-shek is defeated!" "Without the Eighth Route Army, we workers would have been eating soybean cakes long ago; we would never have the good life we have today." On this day, workers who were off-shift also voluntarily went down into the mines to work. For example, at the Shu character mine, normally twenty-three people went down into the mine, but on this day, twenty-eight people went down; workers Li Yushan and Li Shuangxi, who had been sick for several days and had not been to work, went down into the mine to work despite their illness on this day. Cadres from the Management Office also took time out to participate in production at various mines. At the entrances of the mines, large red flags bearing the words "Support the Front Lines Day" fluttered, and the workers competed with each other. For example, the An character mine produced 316 kilns on weekdays in June, but 420 kilns on "Support Day." According to statistics, the output of the entire mining area on this day exceeded the normal daily output by more than 30%. From April to June, the total number of people participating in Support Day in the entire mining area was 8,939, and the total amount of funds donated was more than 34,080,000 yuan. In addition to the voluntary work on "Support Day," many people also voluntarily contributed their labor individually. For example, Yuan Wangui, a kiln worker from the 18th and 19th wells, contributed twenty-three workdays in May and June, earning a total of 45,050 yuan, all of which he donated to support the front lines. In the Tai'an well, twenty cadres from three kilns donated a total of 122 workdays in two months, donating all their wages of 185,010 yuan. In total, the entire mining area contributed 375 workdays in three months, worth a total of 534,649 yuan.
    The donation movement also formed a craze. Among the cadres, many personnel implementing the supply system used their health and clothing expenses, in addition to their monthly food allowance, entirely to support the front lines. Some cadres donated between 10,000 and 100,000 yuan from their savings accumulated over many years of frugality to support the front lines. For example, Jia Shaoyu donated 20,000 yuan, Ren Zhenwu donated 93,000 yuan, and Guo Shimin donated 100,000 yuan in installments throughout the year. In total, the employees of the entire mining area donated more than 3,145,000 yuan in three months. Including the 4,467,200 yuan donated by the employees of the coking plant in three months, the total was more than 7,610,000 yuan. (Zhi Zhong)

    工矿工人高度热情节约增产支援战争
    峰峰矿区：开展支援前线日运动
    三月献金四千余万元
    【本报讯】峰峰矿区支援前线运动，起初提出因无组织，陷于自流，三月二十八日，领导上召集了全体职工大会，一致通过每月一日为“支援前线日”。这一天，参加生产的人，完全是义务工，厂方在生产中消耗的材料，也作为支援前线用，把这一天生产的煤，全部售出，作为支援前线的款项。
    工友们热烈执行自己的决定，一致说：“不打败蒋介石，支援前线不停止！”“没有八路军，我们工人早就吃上豆饼了，绝没有今天的好生活”，到这一天，歇班的工人，也都自动下窑生产，如恕字窑，平日下窑二十三个人，这一天下到二十八个人；工人李玉山、李双喜，都是病了好几天没有上班，这一天，带病下窑工作。管理处机关干部也抽出时间，到各窑参加生产。各窑口上，飘扬着上书“支援前线日”的大红旗，工人们争着比赛，如安字窑六月份平日出三百一十六窑，“支援日”出了四百二十窑，据统计，这一天全矿区超过平日产量百分之三十以上。全矿区四、五、六三个月支援日参加总人数是八千九百三十九名，支援款共计三千四百零八万余元。除“支援日”义务工作外，单独献工者也很多。如十八、九号井窑匠袁万贵，五、六两个月份献工二十三个，共得工资四万五千零五十元，全部拿出支援前线。太安井三个窑两月中干部献工者共二十名，一百二十二个工，献出全部工资十八万五千零十元。总计献工一项，全矿区三个月共献工三百七十五个，合五十三万四千六百四十九元。
    献金运动，也形成热潮。在干部中，许多实行供给制度的人员，除每月领取伙食费以外，卫生费、服装费等完全作为支援前线用。有些干部，由多年省吃减用的积蓄中抽出一万至十万支援前线。如贾绍虞支援二万，任振武九万三千元，郭士敏全年分期拿出十万元。总计，三个月全矿区职工献金三百一十四万五千余元。连焦炭厂三个月职工的献金额四百四十六万七千二百在内，共计七百六十余万元。（致中）
