　　Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 29th. TASS reported from Moscow on the 27th that Anglo-Soviet trade negotiations had broken down. A communique stated: In the autumn of 1946 and early 1947, the British government proposed to the Soviet government that trade between the two countries be expanded. This negotiation was decided upon as a result of Bevin's meeting with Stalin in Moscow. At that time, both sides agreed that the Soviet Union would ship timber to Britain, and Britain would supply the Soviet Union with the necessary amount of rails, vehicles, and other machinery for lumber preparation. In April of this year, Wilson, the British Overseas Trade Minister, came to the Soviet Union. During the negotiations, both sides agreed in principle to expand commerce; however, the negotiations were interrupted because the British side refused to consider the conditions attached by the Soviet side when it agreed at the time, namely, to revise the harsh terms of the wartime British loan to the Soviet Union according to the agreement of August 1941. After agreeing to amend the terms of the above agreement, the British government suggested reopening negotiations in June, and Wilson and his party arrived in Moscow again on June 20. During the negotiations, the Soviet side suggested that if the British side agreed to amend the terms of the loan in the 1941 agreement and supply the Soviet Union with a fixed amount of equipment for the timber and petroleum industries (50,000 tons of narrow-gauge in 1947, 100,000 tons annually from 1948 to 1950, and 100,000 tons of oil pipes for the petroleum industry annually from 1948 to 1950), the Soviet Union would agree to supply Britain with 1 million tons of grain in 1947, 1.5 million tons in 1948, 2 million tons annually from 1949 to 1950, and 2.03 million boxes of canned goods, shark, and crab meat from 1947 to 1950, as well as 53,000 cubic meters of timber in 1947 (with a corresponding increase each year thereafter). However, Britain refused to supply the Soviet Union with the required equipment for the timber and petroleum industries, even though the value of the goods exported by Britain was several times less than that of the Soviet Union. This is the first reason for the failure of the negotiations. The second reason for the failure is that the British side rejected the Soviet proposal to postpone repayment of half of the loan for fifteen years, and was only willing to postpone a quarter of the loan. Since the position taken by the British side was unacceptable to the Soviet side, the negotiations came to a standstill. On July 24, Reuters spread rumors that the failure of the negotiations was due to the high price of Soviet grain; in fact, both sides had reached an agreement on grain prices, and the agreed price of wheat was not only lower than what Britain recently purchased from Argentina, but also lower than the current market price in Canada.

### 英苏谈判破裂  责任全在英方

    英苏谈判破裂
    责任全在英方
    【新华社陕北二十九日电】莫斯科讯，塔斯社于二十七日发表英苏贸易谈判公报称：一九四六年秋及一九四七年初，英政府曾向苏联政府提议扩展两国间的贸易。由于贝文在莫斯科时与斯大林会谈结果，决定举行此项谈判。当时双方并同意，苏输送木料至英，英则供给苏联所需数量之铁轨、车辆及其他机械的伐木准备。今年四月，英海外贸易大臣威尔逊来苏，在谈判中，双方在原则上同意扩展商业；但由于英方拒绝考虑苏方当时同意时所附之条件，即修改依照一九四一年八月的协定在战时英国所予苏联贷款的苛刻条款，谈判遂告中断。在同意修改上项协定条款后，英政府于六月建议重开谈判，威尔逊一行于六月二十日重抵苏京。谈判期间，苏方建议，如英方同意修改一九四一年协定中贷款的条款并供给苏联定量的木材工业及石油工业装备（窄轨一九四七年五万吨，一九四八至五○年每年十万吨，及一九四八至五○年每年石油工业的油管十万吨），则苏联同意供给英国谷物计一九四七年一百万吨，一九四八年一百五十万吨，一九四九至五○年每年两百万吨，并于一九四七至五○年期间供给英国罐头、鲨鱼及蟹肉两百零三万箱，以及木材一九四七年五万三千方（以后每年有相当增加）。但是英国拒绝供给苏联所要求的木材工业及石油工业的装备，虽然英方所输出的货物价值少于苏联的数倍。这是谈判失败的第一个原因。失败的第二个原因在于英方拒绝苏方将贷款一半延期十五年偿还的建议，而愿意将贷款四分之一延期。由于英方所采取的立场不能为苏方所接受，谈判遂告停顿。七月二十四日路透社散布谣言说：谈判失败是由于苏方谷物价格过高；其实，双方曾获得关系谷物价格的协议，所定的小麦价格不仅低于英国最近购自阿根廷者，并且低于目前加拿大的市价。
