　　Cheyuan Village Eliminates the Three Pests
    [This Dispatch from the People's Daily, Licheng] In the Fifth District's Cheyuan Village, various crops have begun to sprout since the rains, but they have been severely damaged by groundhogs and badgers, etc. In order to protect the crops, model cadre Guo Tianfu convened a meeting of cadres to discuss and launch a pest elimination campaign. Chen Huoquan said: This is a good thing. Half of my two mu of Daitung groundhogs are eaten every year, which means I harvest ten less dan of grain. After discussion, they also proposed pest elimination bonuses: 200 yuan for each groundhog killed with one's own gunpowder, 100 yuan for each groundhog killed with the village's gunpowder, and 1,000 yuan for each badger killed; in addition, every household should catch mice. This batch of rewards will be evenly distributed by those responsible for the affected areas. After the decision was made, two people killed a total of 104 groundhogs and one badger in four days. When hunting, one must wait for it to stick its head out and stand firmly on its front feet in one place before shooting accurately. The pest elimination campaign is actively underway.

　　车元村除三害
    【本报黎城讯】五区车元村，经落雨后各种庄稼都莠了穗，被＠、獾等咬毁甚多。为了保护庄稼，模范干部郭天福召开干部会议讨论，开展除害运动。陈火全说：这倒是件好事情，我种大东＠的二亩地，每年都被＠吃一半，就少打石把粮食。讨论后，并提出除害奖金，自己火药打一个二百元，村上火药打一个＠一百元，打一个獾一千元；另外家家户户捉老鼠。这批奖励金由受害地区的地里负责均摊。决定后，二人四天共打了＠一○四个獾一个。在打的时候，要等它出头和前蹄站稳在一个地方一打就准。打害运动，正积极开展中。（书魁、先菊）
