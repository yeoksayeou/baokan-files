    Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 31st. The Shanghai Ta Kung Pao reports: The banknotes ordered by the Chiang government continue to be shipped from abroad in a constant stream. On June 28th, a total of 160 boxes of large banknotes were shipped to Shanghai by the British ship Glenappin. Also, news: Since the mass issuance of 10,000-yuan banknotes, the Chiang-controlled Hunan-Guangxi-Guizhou Railway Bureau has stopped accepting Chiang currency below 500 yuan. The broad masses of the people are increasingly losing confidence in the Chiang currency. The transaction of hard (silver) currency in various counties of Hubei Province has become an open secret, and in some areas, transactions cannot be completed without hard currency. The military supply organs of the Chiang army's front-line troops are also storing large amounts of hard currency for use when they are defeated and scattered.

    蒋币日渐失掉信用
    【新华社陕北三十一电】沪大公报讯：蒋政府定制的钞票，继续源源自外国运来，六月二十八日由英国怡泰轮格林阿潘号运沪之大钞即达一百六十箱。又息：自万元大钞大量发行后，蒋记湘桂黔路局已不收用五百元以下之蒋币。广大人民对蒋币日渐失掉信任，鄂境各县之硬（银）币交易，已成公开秘密，且有若干地区非硬币不能成交。蒋军前方部队之军需机关，也大量储存硬币，以便被击灭逃散时使用。
