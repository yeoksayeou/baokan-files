    [This newspaper's Hebei-Shandong-Henan dispatch, 2nd] The Fourth CPC Hebei-Shandong-Henan Committee, based on the widespread introspection during the cadre and mass meetings in Kunwu, Gaoling, and other counties regarding the issue of drawing a clear line with landlords as a "bomb shelter," has instructed all counties to universally launch a mass ideological awareness campaign during the re-examination. First, cadres and masses, influenced by the threat of landlords, ideologically and behaviorally act as "bomb shelters" for landlords. As long as the leadership patiently enlightens them, and after introspection, they unanimously recognize the landlords' soft and hard, vicious methods, clarifying the view that all sins are attributable to the landlords, and then, through the leadership's call for peasants to emancipate themselves and change their minds, frankly introspect to remove mental burdens, cut off the tail, and return home ideologically (become aware), the peasants are capable of frankness and awareness. Second, resolutely severing ideological ties with landlords, drawing class lines, and achieving great unity among the peasants have a significant impact on implementing the re-examination. Any method that does not enlighten the masses to be aware but simply uses coercion is wrong and unworkable. Third, the development of this movement can generally be effectively launched only under the condition that poor peasant backbones have been established. After poor peasant activists take the lead, the general masses follow, mobilizing the backward to frankly introspect, and the movement can be vigorously developed and implemented in conjunction with the re-examination movement.

    割断与地主的思想联系
    冀鲁豫四地委指示提高群众思想自觉
    【本报冀鲁豫二日电】四地委顷根据昆吾、高陵等县干群大会上，普遍反省出“防空洞”划清与地主界限问题，指示各县在复查中，普遍开展群众思想自觉运动。第一、干群因受地主威胁的影响，在思想上、行动上做地主“防空洞”，只要领导上耐心启发，经过反省，一致认清地主的软硬毒辣办法，明确了一切罪恶归地主的观点，再经领导上号召农民要翻身换脑筋，坦白反省去心病，割尾巴，思想回家（自觉），农民是能够坦白自觉的。第二、坚决割断与地主的思想联系，划阶级，达到农民大团结，这对贯澈复查有极大作用，任何不启发群众自觉而单纯强制的办法都是错误的，行不通的。第三，这一运动的开展，一般是在贫农骨干已树立的条件下才能有力掀起，经过贫农积极分子带头，一般群众跟上，发动落后坦白反省，运动就能蓬勃开展起来，和复查运动结合贯彻下去。
