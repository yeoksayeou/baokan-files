Xinhua News Agency, Central China, 20th: *Su Bei Daily* recently published an editorial entitled "The Victory of Yancheng," celebrating this great victory since Chiang's retreat. The editorial recounted: When the People's Liberation Army temporarily abandoned all the county towns in Central China last winter, Chiang Kai-shek and his cronies clamored: "The *Su Bei* war is nearing its end," "Only a few 'remnant bandits' are left in *Su Bei*," and even designated Yancheng County as a "model county for suppression," and even wanted to invite foreign journalists to visit, hoping to please his American daddy. Unexpectedly, history is so merciless, that the so-called "remnant bandits" would capture Yancheng, the "model county for suppression," eight months after the "war has come to an end," and annihilate a division of the enemy, and sweep away more than ten surrounding Chiang-puppet strongholds, controlling two hundred *li* of the Tongyu Highway, causing the entire *Su Bei* Chiang-puppets to lose their spirits. The article continued: The great political significance of this victorious battle lies in proving once again that the people cannot be conquered. Although the Chiang army temporarily occupied all the county towns in the Central China Liberated Area, to this day, eighty percent of the area, including most of the towns and vast rural areas, is still in the hands of the people. At the same time, due to the increasing strength of the People's Liberation Army in Central China since Chiang's retreat, the increasing richness of experience in adhering to the struggle, the increasingly widespread and in-depth mass anti-Chiang struggle, and the Chiang army's insufficient strength and low morale, the people can reclaim these few occupied points and lines at any time. This time, annihilating a division of the traitor Hao's remnants and recovering Yancheng is a test of the large-scale counter-offensive being prepared in Central China since Chiang's retreat. The editorial also stated: The victory of Yancheng is also a very good education for ourselves. Facts have proved that not only can we persist in the self-defense struggle after Chiang's retreat, but we can also recover lost land, and even expand the liberated areas. The only question is whether we are subjectively determined. It lies in learning how to correctly use struggle strategies under new conditions, and in how to rely on the people and unite the people. As long as we can grasp these, we will surely be able to persevere to the final victory and persevere to the national counter-offensive.
Xinhua News Agency, Central China, 20th: A reporter from the *Su Bei* branch commented on the victory of Yancheng, pointing out that this glorious victory happened just when the American executioner Wedemeyer came to China, Chiang Kai-shek further betrayed the country, and boasted to his master about the "victory" on the East China battlefield, making its significance even greater. Wedemeyer, served by lackeys like Chen Cheng, flew around everywhere, but he was unwilling and dared not come to *Su Bei*, which faces Chiang's confidant region of Nanjing and Shanghai across the river, to see what the real situation here is like. The People's Liberation Army and patriotic people here can not only control the vast rural areas, remove small Chiang army strongholds (towns), but also capture large cities like Yancheng, annihilate entire divisions of the Chiang army, and capture batches of high-ranking military officers alive. In particular, it proves to Wedemeyer that you have equipped and trained more than fifty American-equipped divisions for Chiang Kai-shek in the past, and after more than a year of civil war, nearly half have been lost. As a result, even a few isolated cities in *Su Bei* on the other side of Nanjing and Shanghai cannot be firmly defended. So even if dozens more divisions are equipped and trained for Chiang in the future, what fundamental impact will it have on the inevitable collapse of Chiang Kai-shek's traitorous dictatorship and the final victory of the people's patriotic self-defense war? But this is exactly what the American imperialists who directed him to come to China do not want to hear.

　　苏北日报评盐城大捷依靠人民一定胜利
    美国挽救不了蒋党必败命运
    【新华社华中二十日电】苏北日报顷以“叶挺之捷”为题发表社论，庆祝此一蒋后伟大胜利。社论追述：当去冬解放军暂时放弃华中所有县城，蒋介石及其大小喽罗们即叫嚣：“苏北战争已近尾声”，“苏北只剩少数‘残匪’”，并把叶挺县划为“清剿模范县”，而且还要请外国记者团来参观，希望讨得他美国洋爸爸的欢喜。想不到历史是这样的无情，所谓“残匪”竟会在“战争已成尾声”的八个月之后攻克了“清剿模范县”的叶挺城，而且歼敌一师，并扫荡了周围蒋伪据点十余处，控制通榆公路二百华里，使整个苏北蒋伪为之丧魂落魄。社会继称：这一胜利战役的重大政治意义，在于再一次证明了人民是不可被征服的。蒋军虽然暂时侵占了华中解放区的所有县城，但迄今为止，百分之八十的地区，包括大部分市镇和广大农村，依然在人民手里，同时由于华中蒋后人民解放军日益壮大、坚持斗争的经验日益丰富，群众性反蒋斗争日益广泛深入，以及蒋军兵力不足，士气低落，这些少数被占点线，人民也随时可以收回。此次歼灭郝逆残部一个师，收复叶挺城，就是华中蒋后准备大反攻的一个试验。社论又称：叶挺大捷对我们自己也是一个极好的教育，事实证明不仅我们可以在蒋后坚持自卫斗争，而且可以收复失地，甚至还可以扩大解放区。问题只在于主观上坚定与否。在于学会如何在新的条件下正确运用斗争策略，在于如何依靠人民、团结人民。只要能够把握这些，我们就一定能坚持到最后胜利，坚持到全国大反攻。
    【新华社华中二十日电】苏北分社记者评叶挺城之捷，指出这一辉煌胜利刚好发生在美国郐子手魏德迈来华、蒋介石进一步卖国、并向其主子夸耀华东战场“胜利”之际，其意义更加重大。魏德迈在陈诚等奴才跟班侍候下，到处乱飞，可是他不愿也不敢到此与蒋家心腹地区京沪隔江相望的苏北，来看一看这里的真实情形究竟怎样。这儿的解放军与爱国人民，不仅能控制广大农村，拔除蒋军小据点（市镇），并能攻下象盐城这样的大城，歼灭整师的蒋军，活捉成批的高级军官。特别是它证明给魏德迈看看你过去替蒋介石装备和训练了五十多个美械师，打了一年多内战，丧失已近半数，结果连京沪对岸的苏北几座孤城都不能固守。那么今后即使再替蒋装备和训练几十个师，对蒋介石卖国独裁统治的必然崩溃与人民爱国自卫战争的最后必胜，又会起什么根本的影响呢？但这正是指使他来华的美帝国主义者一点也不愿听闻的。
