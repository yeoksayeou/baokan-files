Xinhua News Agency, Jin-Cha-Ji, 18th: In the Jin-Cha-Ji Border Region, hail and drought are occurring in alternating succession, creating a serious disaster situation. Governments at all levels in the Border Region have issued urgent instructions for drought resistance and famine preparation, calling on all localities to vigorously implement drought resistance and famine preparation in close combination with land reform, participation in the war, and large-scale production, and to resist the plundering by stubborn enemies and puppet forces, to ensure the harvest. In the disaster-stricken areas, the amount of rainfall in the Chahar South region has been imbalanced since May, and about 30-40% of the land is barren. Among them, Yi County was hit by hail at the end of last month, and the seedlings in dozens of villages were flattened. In Jinji, there has been no soaking rain since the beginning of spring, and hail disasters have been serious since summer. According to statistics from the Jinji Party Committee, there are 320,000 mu of barren land. Among them, the hail disaster in Tang County, according to local people, is unprecedented in more than ten years. In more than 20 villages in the county, the affected population reached 7,739 people. The drought in Central Hebei is relatively light, but the hail disaster is serious. On June 21st, the Sixth Sub-district was hit by giant hailstones as big as chicken eggs, accumulating about half a foot. The affected counties include Ningjin, Zhao County, and Gaocheng, with an affected area of more than 206,000 mu. Among them, the disaster-stricken area in Ningjin has mostly planted late seedlings. The instructions call for four points: (1) Rescue the already-formed and tasselled corn, sorghum, and fruits such as persimmons and dates that can replace food. Strictly use canals, lakes, and wells, organize manpower and animal power to carry water for irrigation, and hoe the land more. (2) Carry water to plant sweet potatoes, radishes, etc. (3) Organize the masses or cooperatives to purchase or adjust seeds such as sixty-day return grain, mung beans, buckwheat, and turnips, and sow them on land that has not been sown or already has seedlings. (4) Stop using food for winemaking, prohibit the export of food, strengthen food adjustment, call for a "handful of rice movement," accumulate wild vegetables, and create a mass-based conservation movement. The instructions finally require that all party, government, and military organs should play a leading and guaranteeing role in their stationed areas.
