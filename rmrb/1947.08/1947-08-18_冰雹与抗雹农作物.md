　　Hail and Hail-Resistant Crops
　　Xi Fengzhou
　　The hailstorm in the Taihang area this year is said to be the most severe in decades, and the damage to crops caused by the hailstorm is also an unprecedented record in decades. Now, the masses in various places are paying special attention to the hail this year and are also raising many questions, which can be summarized as follows: "Why does it hail?" "Why does it hail mostly in the afternoon in summer?" "Why is hail sometimes big and sometimes small?" "Why is hail transparent on the outside and white in the middle?" "Which crops can resist hail?"
　　The principle of hail formation is not mysterious. When it begins to fall, there are many large black clouds that fly up and down incessantly, reaching as high as about 280,000 feet. The temperature between six and ten miles above the ground is all supercooled raindrops, and it is even colder above ten miles, where water vapor can directly turn into snowflakes. The so-called supercooled raindrops are raindrops that are about to freeze. Because water vapor rises to different heights in the air, those that rise higher quickly turn into snowflakes, while some only rise to the supercooled raindrop layer and do not rise further. Therefore, the snowflakes from high altitudes fall into the supercooled raindrop layer, and many raindrops immediately envelop the snowflakes, increasing their weight and forcing them to fall. When they fall into a warmer air layer, some of them turn into water, and then the black clouds rise violently again (as if returning to the original place), and then fall again. This up-and-down movement turns them into hail.
　　It is also a fact that hail falls mostly in the afternoon in summer. This is because the upward force of the air is very strong in June and July in summer. Strong solar radiation is needed to make the rising air strong, and the solar radiation is stronger in summer than in any other season. If the time of hail is calculated according to the time of day in summer, it is mostly around three o'clock in the afternoon, which is also because the upward airflow is strongest at that time.
　　The reason why the hail that falls is sometimes big and sometimes small is because of the different amounts of water droplets that condense. Moreover, hailstorms are different from rain. When hail is formed and falls, it takes a longer time. Because the upward force of the air is strong, it can resist the hail and keep it in the cloud layer for a long time, and raindrops can attach to it and condense at any time. Hailstones that stay longer and condense more water droplets are larger in volume, while those that stay shorter and condense fewer water droplets are smaller in volume.
　　Hail is transparent on the outside and white in the middle. Some people say that hail has small holes. According to research results, when snow-like objects fall into a water droplet layer at a certain altitude, the condensation of hail suddenly increases. During condensation, many air bubbles are enclosed inside, so the condensation of this layer appears opaque and entirely white, and the texture is slightly soft. Later, it falls down from a high altitude again, and the water droplets in this space have not reached below the freezing point. However, the ice block comes down from a high altitude with great speed, and its temperature does not have time to rise sharply to the freezing point, so the water droplets attach to its surface and immediately condense into ice, without any air bubbles enclosed inside. Therefore, the condensation of this layer becomes transparent. Later, when such hail falls to the ground, it appears transparent on the outside and white on the inside.
　　No matter what kind of crop, it will be damaged after being hit by hail. However, according to the observation results after hail in various places this year, it has indeed been found that some crops have strong resistance to hail. For example, in the Xingtai No. 1 district, many millet and sorghum seedlings below one foot high were completely destroyed by hail. Most people thought that there would be no harvest at all, but after more than ten days, after two rains, they all sprouted branches from the roots, and it looked as if they had never been hit by hail. In particular, sorghum has a stronger hail resistance. Even if the seedlings are completely destroyed, as long as there are roots, they can quickly sprout branches and grow. This characteristic is more obvious in the "candle sorghum" variety. If millet and sorghum seedlings grow too high or are about to head, their hail resistance will be weakened, because they will no longer tiller at this time. After being hit by hail, they can no longer sprout branches. This shows that crops with strong "regenerative ability" and "tillering ability" have strong resistance to hail. In addition, red sorghum (gaoliang) is not only a drought-resistant and famine-relief crop, but also the most resistant to hail. In some areas this year, the vines of red sorghum were severely damaged by hail, and all the leaves were destroyed. After a few days, they all grew back. In the past few years, farmers in Zanhuang County knew that red sorghum was the most resistant to hail. The Taihang area often suffers from hailstorms and is also dry nine years out of ten. It is very necessary to choose regions and promote red sorghum in a planned way!

### 冰雹与抗雹农作物

　　冰雹与抗雹农作物
    席凤洲
    今年太行区的雹灾，据说是数十年来最严重的一次，农作物因雹灾所受到的损失，也是几十年来空前的纪录。现在，各地群众对于今年降雹，都特别注意，而且也提出不少问题，集中起来，约有以下几个：“为什么会下冰雹”？“下冰雹为什么多在夏季的下午”？“冰雹为什么有大有小”？“冰雹为什么外边透明中间有白心”？“那些农作物能抵抗冰雹”？
    下冰雹的道理，并没什么神秘，在开始下降的时候，预先就有很多大块的黑云，上下来往不停的飞跑，最高能升到廿八万尺左右。凡是离地面六里到十里中间的温度，全是过冷却的雨点，在十里以上就更加冷了，水蒸气可直接变成雪花。所说那过冷却的雨点，就是将要结成冰的雨点。因为空中上升的水蒸气有高有低，升得更高的就很快变成雪花，有的只升到过冷却的雨点层就不上升了。于是高处的雪花降落到过冷却的雨点层中，雪花的周围立刻就包上许多雨点，使这雪花增加了重量，不得不往下落。落到较暖的空气层中，有一部分变成了水，当时又有黑云猛烈的升上去（好象又回原处），以后又落下来，这样一上一下就变成冰雹了。
    降冰雹多在夏季的下午，这也是事实。因为在夏季的六、七月间，空气的上升力非常强烈，要使上升的空气强烈，又需要很强的日射，一年四季之中，都比不上夏季的日射强。下雹子的时间，若按夏季一天中间的时间计算，多在下午三点钟左右，这也是因为那时的气流上升最盛的原因。
    降下的冰雹有大有小，是因为凝结的水滴有多有少的原因。而且，下雹子和下雨不同，当冰雹的组成和降落的时候，需用时间较长，因空气上升力强，能够长时间的抵住冰雹留在云层中，随时有雨滴附着它凝结，留时候长的和凝结水滴多的，冰雹体积就大，留时候短的和凝结水点少的，冰雹体积就小。
    冰雹外边层透明里面有白心，有人俗说冰雹有小孔。据研究结果，当雪块似的东西，降到一定高空的水滴层中，冰雹的凝结突然增大，在凝结时，其中有许多泡孔封闭在里面，所以这层的凝结就看出不透明，而且，全是白色，体质又略见松软。后来，它再从高空往下落，这个空际的水滴，还没有达到冰点以下。可是，冰块从高处下来，速力很大，它的温度来不及陡升至冰点，所以水滴附在它的表面，立即凝结成冰，并且没气泡封闭在内，于是这层的凝结便成透明了。以后这样的冰雹降到地面，就看出外边透明心里发白。
    无论那种农作物，经过雹打以后，总要受到损失与破坏，但根据今年各地降雹以后观察结果，确实发现有些农作物抵抗冰雹力很强，如在邢台一区一带，有很多一尺高以下的谷苗和黍苗，全被冰雹打光了，一般人都认为没有一点收成了，可是经过十几天以后，下了两次雨，全又从根旁支出杈来，看法好象是从未遭过雹打的农作物。特别是黍子抗雹力更强，就是把幼苗打的再光，只要有根，就能很快支杈生长，有种“蜡烛黍子”这个特点更明显。如果谷苗和黍苗，长到过高时或将要吐穗时，抗雹力就弱了，因为这时候不再分蘖，经过雹打，就不能再发杈了。这说明“再生力”和“分蘖力”强的农作物，抗抵冰雹力就强。另外，红果（甘）不但是耐旱和渡荒的作物，而且，也是抵抗冰雹最强的植物，在今年有些地区种的红果，蔓子被冰雹打的很重，叶子全打光了，经过几天，全又生出来了，就是在前几年，赞皇县的农民，很多人就知道红果最能抵抗冰雹。在太行区常闹雹灾，又是十年九旱，很需要选择地区有计划的去推广红果！
