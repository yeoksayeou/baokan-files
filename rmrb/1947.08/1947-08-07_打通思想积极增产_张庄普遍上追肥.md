Unleash Ideology to Actively Increase Production
    Zhang Village Universally Applies Topdressing Fertilizer
    [Report from the Front, Lucheng] On the 29th of last month, Zhang Village in the Fifth District convened a mass meeting of the entire village to discuss increasing production and how to grow more grain, mobilizing the entire village to apply topdressing fertilizer. During the discussion, two ideas were discovered: one was that increasing production would lead to grain being borrowed by disaster areas, and the other was fear of the burden, because these two ideological obstacles prevented them from daring to increase production and become prosperous, thinking that it was not for their own benefit. After repeated explanations by Liu, the branch secretary, a guarantee was given that they could increase production without worry, and that there was no need to fear grain borrowing. The old liberated areas did not borrow grain from the new liberated areas during the 1943 famine, and no one starved to death. On the contrary, many people starved to death in the new liberated areas. Then, the burden was calculated, and it was found that it was only half of the "shegui" grain given to the (Catholic) priests in the past, not counting the grain plundered by the enemy and puppets, and the cost of maintaining the grain. Yang Zhong said, "We understand now. The Communist Party is really working for the benefit of everyone. The government is calling on us to apply topdressing fertilizer. I originally thought that it was not for our own benefit, and I was only afraid that it would be borrowed by disaster areas and increase the burden. I have a total of 46 mu of land, and I only planned to apply a little fertilizer to a few of the 9 mu of wheat I planted, just to get by. This was all wrong of me. I will apply topdressing fertilizer to all of it, and try not to leave a single drop of night soil. If it's not enough, I'll supplement it with beans and oil." Zhang Wenming said, "We should apply night soil to the land near us, and apply bean cakes and oil to the land far away, so that we can save manpower." Shi Heshun said, "Applying topdressing fertilizer is like investing in a cooperative. We will draw dividends in two months. Investing one and drawing three is really true." Finally, each mutual aid team in the village set its own plan. The village has a total of more than 5,600 mu of land, of which more than 2,300 mu are planted with corn, and all of them will be fertilized with topdressing. All the corn will be hoeed three times (because most of it has already been hoeed twice), and some teams will also apply topdressing fertilizer to the remaining grain fields. The whole village realized that "grain is the lifeline, and land is a treasure bowl." Everyone's enthusiasm was very high. A production increase plan was set, and specific tasks were assigned. Men will deliver night soil and dry manure, and women and children will be responsible for fertilizing with bean cakes and oil. The whole village stipulated that it must be completed in seven days, and to strive for success on top of success, each team elected a correspondent, who will report the achievements every night for broadcasting.

    打通思想积极增产
    张庄普遍上追肥
    【本报潞城讯】五区张庄村上月二十九日召开了全村群众大会，讨论增产，如何能多打粮食，发动全村都上追肥。讨论中发现了两种思想：一个是增产多怕灾区借粮，一个是怕负担，因这两种思想障碍阻止不敢增产发家，认为不是给自己种的。经柳分书再三解释，提出保证，放心增产，不怕借粮，老区四三年灾荒并没向新区借过粮，也没饿死人，新区倒饿死许多人，接着又算了负担轻重，一算只顶过去给（天主）神甫出社规粮一半，其余敌伪抢粮，及维持粮食不算。杨忠说：“我们可通啦，现在共产党真是给咱大家谋利益，政府号召咱上追肥，我原认为不是给自己种的，只怕给灾区借走，多出负担，我共种地四十六亩种麦子九亩想奶上几亩应付一下，这都是我的不对，我要完全上追肥，尽量不留一点圊粪，不够用豆子和油补奶。”张文明说：“咱要把圊粪上到近地，远地上豆饼和油等，能节省民力”。师和顺说：“上追肥好比往合作社入股，两个月就要抽红利，入一抽三真算话。”最后全村各互助组定了各组计划，全村共地五千六百余亩，共种玉茭二千三百余亩，都要上追肥，玉茭都要争取锄三遍（因二遍大部锄过），其余的谷地有的组也要上追肥，全村认识到“粮食是命根，地是聚宝盆”，大家情绪非常高涨，定了增产计划，具体分工，男人送圊粪干粪，妇女儿童负责奶豆饼和油，全村规定七天完成，要争取功上加功，各组选有通讯员，每天黑夜报功进行广播。（师怀义、云峰）
