　　Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 16th. The Hong Kong "Wah Sheung Daily" recently published a letter from the All-China Students' Federation to the first International Youth Day Congress in Prague, accusing American imperialism of aiding Chiang in launching a civil war, slaughtering Chinese people, and persecuting Chinese students and professors. The original letter stated: "Since the victory over Japan, China has once again fallen into the tragic situation of civil war. Civil war violates the will of the people; civil war is only for a small number of families to maintain and strengthen their position, so it is hated by the whole nation. Now the rulers of China are encouraged by American aid and are challenging the entire Chinese people. Chinese students have been constantly fighting against civil war in the past two years and will continue to struggle for the realization of democracy and peace in China. Recently, the anti-hunger and anti-civil war struggle of Chinese students has spread to every corner of China (referring to the KMT-controlled areas). Eighty percent of Chinese students have participated in strikes, and strikes in many schools have lasted for more than a month. The reactionary rulers of China, fearing the growth of the people's power, have resorted to open actions such as arresting students, professors, journalists, liberals, and closing newspapers that publish people's opinions. However, the consequences of these retaliatory actions are contrary to the wishes of the reactionary rulers, and Chinese students have united to resist this persecution." The letter reported that the All-China Students' Federation was established in late June. It also expressed gratitude for the sympathy and assistance of the world's youth, and finally the Federation expressed to the world's youth: "We firmly believe that democracy will soon triumph, and we vow to fight with you for freedom and democracy throughout the world."
    Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 16th. Prague dispatch: Youth representatives from various countries participating in the International Youth Day celebrations have been happily spending nearly four weeks. They have not only listened to reports on the lives of young people in China, Egypt, Indonesia, Germany, and other countries, and the heroic struggles of democratic youth in many countries, but also held ball games, chess matches, swimming, folk dances, concerts, and other entertainment programs. Outstanding young artists, musicians, and athletes from various countries have shown their talents. In many competitions, Soviet young singers, musicians, and violinists won first place. Volleyball players from Leningrad defeated the Czech volleyball team, which is known for its bravery and strength. On the 9th, the conference discussed the issue of "Youth and Culture" and held demonstrations of sports skills. Young people from the Mongolian People's Republic performed whip skills, which were well received. On the 10th, a large-scale carnival was held. On the 13th, the plenary session discussed supporting the youth of Spain and Greece in their struggle for freedom and independence.

　　全国学联致函国际青年节大会
  　控诉美蒋屠杀中国人民
    感谢世界青年声援中国学生运动
    【新华社陕北十六日电】香港华商报最近发表全国学生联合会致布拉格首届国际青年节大会的函件，向全世界青年控诉美国帝国主义援蒋进行内战，屠杀中国人民，及迫害中国学生、教授的罪行。原函略称：“自战胜日本以来，中国就再一次陷入内战的悲惨境遇中。内战违反人民大众的意志；内战只是为了少数家族保持并加强其地位，因此就为全民一致憎恨。现在中国的统治者正为美国援助所鼓舞，而向全中国人民挑战。中国学生在过去两年内曾不断为反对内战而斗争，今后将继续为中国的民主和平实现而奋斗。近来中国学生的反饥饿反内战斗争已开展至中国（按指蒋管区）每一角落，百分之八十的中国学生参加了罢课，许多学校的罢课坚持一月以上。中国反动统治者因惧怕人民力量的增长，就诉诸逮捕学生、教授、记者、自由主义者、封闭发表人民意见的报纸等公开行动，但这些报复行动的后果恰与反动统治者的愿望相反，中国学生们已经团结起来反抗这种迫害。”函中报告，中国全国学生联合会已于六月下旬成立。并申述对世界青年同情与援助的谢忱，最后该会并向全世界青年表示：“我们坚信民主不久就会胜利，我们宣誓为全世界的自由民主与你们共同奋斗。”
