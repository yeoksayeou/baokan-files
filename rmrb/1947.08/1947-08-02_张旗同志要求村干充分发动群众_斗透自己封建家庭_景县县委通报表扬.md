	Zhang Qi Demands Village Cadres Fully Mobilize the Masses
	To Thoroughly Struggle Against His Own Feudal Family
	Jing County Committee Commends Him in a Circular
	[Our Dispatch] The Jing County Committee recently issued a circular commending Comrade Zhang Qi. The circular stated: Comrade Zhang Qi is from Mazhuang, Ninth District, and served as the Party Committee Secretary in a certain county in Taihang. Responding to the Party's call, he proactively wrote to the County Committee requesting a thorough liquidation of his family and fulfillment of the peasants' land demands. During the land reform, Comrade Zhang Qi was able to resolutely stand on the Party's position to handle his family's issues. This spirit is worthy of emulation by all Party comrades. Comrade Zhang Qi's letter to the County Committee stated: Recently, comrades in the village wrote to me, informing me that my family still possesses a large amount of land and has not been struggled against. Upon hearing this, I felt very uneasy. Therefore, in the capacity of a Party member, I solemnly submit my opinion on my family to the Party. My family is a managing landlord in terms of class background and also occupies a dominant position politically. After the incident, they leased out the land for two years, but due to famine, the tenants could not pay the rent, so they took the land back and cultivated it themselves, employing long-term laborers. My father served as a puppet Baozhang during the Japanese occupation and his acts of corruption are too numerous to mention. In terms of crimes, he is a very good target for struggle, and the masses will definitely demand to settle accounts with him. However, this target has not been struggled against even now. My estimation is that one possibility is that our area started the mobilization late; another possibility is mainly due to personal relationships. The village cadres may all be surnamed Zhang, or they may be taking care of the fact that I am working outside and are somewhat afraid. This is very possible. Every time I write home, I propose liquidating with the masses, and I also write to the village cadres, expressing my attitude. I hope that comrades in the County Committee will inform the District Committee of my opinion and convey it to the Party Branch Secretary of my village, so that they can fully mobilize the masses to thoroughly liquidate my family. This will make the work in the village more in-depth and also relieve me of a burden.
	[Another Dispatch] Liu Guihua, secretary of the Third District Public Office in Jing County, repeatedly colluded with feudal forces to suppress the mass movement and tied up activists, embezzled the fruits of struggle, and committed many serious misdeeds during the mass movement, seriously betraying the Party and the people. The Jing County Committee has now decided to expel him from the Party and hand him over to the people for handling.

    张旗同志要求村干充分发动群众
    斗透自己封建家庭
    景县县委通报表扬
    【本报讯】景县县委会顷发出通报，表扬张旗同志。通报内称：张旗同志是九区马庄人，在太行×县任区委书记，响应党的号召，主动给县委来信，要求彻底清算他家，满足农民土地要求。张旗同志在土地改革中，能坚决站到党的立场上来处理自己的家庭问题，这种精神值得全党同志学习。张旗同志给县委的信说：最近村里同志来信，告我家中仍拥有大批土地，还没斗争，我听到后，感到非常不安，特以党员的资格，向党郑重提出我对家庭的意见。我的家庭按成份来说是个经营地主，在政治上也占统治地位，事变后出租二年，因灾荒佃户交不上租，又把地收回自种，雇有长工；鬼子在时我父亲曾当过伪保长，贪污的事不胜枚举，按罪恶说是很好的斗争对象，群众一定要求和他算帐，但这样目标竟到现在还未斗。我的估计，一个可能是咱处发动的晚；另一个恐怕主要是情面关系，村干可能都是姓张的，或照顾我在外工作，有些害怕，这是很可能的。我每次向家去信，提出和群众清算，又给村干去信，表明我的态度。望县委同志将我的意见告知区委并转达我村支书同志，要充分发动群众，向我家庭作彻底清算，这样使村里的工作会更加深入，同时也去了我的一块心病。
    【又讯】景县三区区公所秘书刘桂华，在群运中多次勾结封建势力镇压群众运动并捆打积极分子，贪污斗争果实，劣迹重重，严重的背叛了党和人民，景县县委顷特决定开除其党籍，并交人民处理。
