    Calculating Harvest Accounts
    Saving Without Slackening
    Nanma Village Breaks Post-Rain Complacency
    [Our newspaper, Lucheng News] After the rain on July 28th, some of the masses in Nanma Village said: "The rain soaked through, so we don't have to eat chaff and vegetables anymore," showing complacency and paralysis. In order to break the masses' unthrifty thinking after the rain, continue to implement thrift, actively produce, and more powerfully support the front lines and dig up the old roots, the cadres researched and calculated the harvest accounts of the whole village. If there is no shortage of rain in the future, the millet and corn will only have 60-70% of the harvest, and cotton only 40%. Coupled with the reduced harvest this summer, we still have to be thrifty basically. It was decided to use the calculation of each household's harvest accounts to get through the masses' thinking and continue to be thrifty. The whole village will not leave a single vacant lot, sow late vegetables to make up for the losses, and complete the task in three days of concentrated effort. It was also decided that from July 28th to August 2nd, to commemorate "August 1st" week, review the merits and achievements of the Eighth Route Army. Jiang Lizhen said: "The Eighth Route Army sacrifices blood and life at the front to dig up the old roots. I want to refuel production in the rear and commemorate 'August 1st' with practical work. Our team originally planned to finish planting vegetables in three days, but now we decided to complete the task in two days with a concentrated effort." Jin Niu said: "In addition to doing cooperative work, I will take the time to plant vegetables these few days." Finally, everyone unanimously agreed that in these five days, everyone must get up early and work hard to produce, and use practical contributions to commemorate "August 1st." On "August 1st," a forum was held to summarize the achievements of the previous three days. It was calculated that the whole village completed 85.6 mu of concentrated vegetable planting in two and a half days, with an average of more than 0.7 mu of vegetable planting per household. Everyone also decided to continue to implement thrift. (Shi Tuchang, Liu Shude, Yang Fusheng)

    计算收成帐
    节约不放松
    南马庄打破雨后麻痹
    【本报潞城讯】七月廿八号雨后，南马庄部分群众说：雨下透了，这可不用吃糠菜啦，表现自满麻痹，干部为了打破群众落雨后的不节约思想，继续贯彻节约，积极生产，更有力支援前线，刨倒老根，大家研究计算了一下全村收成帐，如果今后不缺雨，谷、玉茭也只有六、七分收成，棉花只有四分收，再加今夏已少收，基本还得节约，决定用算各户收成帐来打通群众思想，继续节约，全村不留一点空地，撒晚菜补窟窿，三天突击完成，并决定从二十八号到八月二号，为纪念“八一”周，回顾八路军的功劳及成绩，江李珍说：“八路军在前线牺牲流血刨老根，我要在后方加油生产，用实际工作纪念‘八一’，我全队原计划三天种完菜，现决定两天突击完成。”金牛说：“我除干合作社工作外，这几天抽空要突击种菜”。最后大家一致认为在这五天中，必须人人起早搭黑加劲生产，用实际功劳来纪念“八一”。“八一”那天举行座谈，总结了前三天成绩，计全村两天半突击种菜八十五亩六分，每户平均种菜七分多。大家又决定要继续贯彻节约。（史土长、刘树德、杨复胜）
