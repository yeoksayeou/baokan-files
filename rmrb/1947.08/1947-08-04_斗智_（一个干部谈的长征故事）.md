    Wits
    (A Cadre's Story of the Long March)
    Leng Bing Ji
    In 1935, I was the artillery company commander in the First Front Army of the Red Army.

    In June, we were preparing to cross the grasslands. The roads were all through mountain forests (Note 1), and marching was harder than ascending to heaven. Our heavier and harder-to-transport weapons were secretly buried at this time. For example, my company now had mostly mortars, except for one or two small mountain guns. Once, in the area where Sichuan and Gansu just bordered each other, at Lazikou, we fought a battle with the White Army. Without much effort, we captured an enemy artillery position. Inside the fortifications, there were more than twenty boxes of mortar shells, four shells per box, all top-notch fish-shaped shells. The political instructor—an old Jiangxi comrade—and I inspected the shells. Of course, we had to take them; truthfully, in the ten years of civil war, many of our weapons and ammunition were “transported” to us by Chiang Kai-shek, acting as a transport captain through his subordinates.

    We also captured some prisoners. Usually, we would disarm the captured prisoners, give them a talk, enlighten their minds, and then release them. However, this time, the political instructor strongly opposed releasing the prisoners. He said, "These shells must be carried by the prisoners." "Alright, if the prisoners are to carry them, then let the prisoners carry them!" I was just "careless" (Note 2) at that time, not used to thinking things through, and didn't know what "mystery" (Note 3) was behind it, so I agreed with the political instructor's idea.

    Each prisoner carried one or two boxes, and the shells were quickly distributed. The political instructor then released the remaining prisoners.

    Everything was handled in this way, and we continued our march westward.

    On the third day, we arrived at Laohuzui (Tiger's Mouth), which was already under the jurisdiction of Gansu Province. It was a very dangerous place: the mountain pass was very narrow, the Baishui River flowed on the left, and the small path on the right was the only road for people to travel. If we passed Laohuzui, we would reach Lintan County town after crossing a mountain ridge. Because it was such an important pass, the White Army had built a fortification on the left side of the mountain, holding it from a high position. If our troops wanted to pass through this pass, we naturally had to destroy the enemy's position. This depended on the firepower of the artillery.

    Sure enough, our artillery position was easily established on the right side of the mountain ridge. I was very surprised that when we were digging fortifications, the White Army only fired twice with machine guns. Because it was far away, they couldn't hit us and then stopped making noise. Why didn't they fire artillery? Of course! Even if they fired artillery, we still had to build our fortifications. But that would buy us time. I really didn't know what those bastards were up to.

    After the fortifications were built, the enemy was still quiet. Both the political instructor and I used binoculars and could clearly see the White Army's trenches, even the machine gun nests and command post shelters were clearly visible. Regardless, we aimed at the enemy's target and set up our artillery. At the same time, we notified our machine gun company to come over to prepare for "reinforcements."

    Just as we were setting up the artillery, hey! The White Army started shouting, their voices dragging out: "You are sparrows pecking at chaff—empty! Your artillery won't fire!" I was really confused. I thought: "Go 'kua zi shi' (Note 4), you motherfucker! You are not the Jade Emperor's mouth; what evidence do you have to say that my artillery won't fire?..." Just then, the political instructor standing beside me smiled.

    He told me that he had known for a long time that the shells captured at Lazikou were fake and wouldn't fire. He said, "Now, let's use our own shells to fire, direct fire, and add an extra explosive charge to the base of the shells." The more I listened, the angrier I became, and I immediately ordered to fire the artillery.

    Boom, boom, boom..., a volley of artillery fire went over. All that could be seen on the opposite mountain was smoke and dust. In the smoke and dust, the enemies were running around in a chaotic manner, like bees whose hive had been accidentally disturbed.

    After the fourth volley of artillery fire, our machine gun company had already taken over the mountain road. In the sound of machine guns, many White Army soldiers were as if competing to perform "hollow back flips" (Note 5); they just fell down and were never seen flipping up again. After about half an hour, our troops were safely advancing on Laohuzui. The remaining White Army soldiers were so scared that they turned tail and ran.

    That night, we victoriously reached our planned campsite. Only then did we learn that the White Army had no artillery. It was said that the White Army's artillery had been withdrawn when they entered Gansu: on the one hand, the White Army had too much equipment and couldn't move the artillery in the mountains; on the other hand, they believed that artillery was of little use on such mountain roads.

    After going to bed, the old Jiangxi comrade told me again that he knew the enemy's trick, what medicine they were selling in the gourd. He said, "I have been fooled by the enemy in the same way before, I recognize those fake shells."

    I asked him, "Then what the hell did you move those fake shells for?"

    He said, "The effect is great." He said the enemy's plan was: on the one hand, to make us move those fake shells to exhaust our troops; on the other hand, to make us all think they were fake shells in the process, so that everyone would no artillery firepower, and no one would gain an advantage. So we had to stubbornly carry the shells, precisely to avoid being deceived, but instead, we used their trick against them, making the enemy complacent, not guarding against the fact that we still had artillery firepower. Besides, the shells weren't carried by us anyway!

    Finally, the old Jiangxi comrade said in a Sichuan accent, "Old brother, do you know Zhuge Liang of the Three Kingdoms? This is called 'Wits'—you son of a bitch!"

    Note:
    (1) "Mountain forest," "tree" - Sichuan local character, read like "ka"; refers to deep mountains and remote wilderness, where there are no people.
    (2) "Paomao" - not meticulous, "doing things paomao" means doing things sloppily.
    (3) "Daohao'er" - specifically refers to the inside story of a certain thing.
    (4) "@ Zishi" - refers to people who have not seen the world, similar to the Northern term "bumpkin".
    (5) "Hollow back flips" - continuous tumbling or somersaulting without touching the ground with limbs.

    斗智
    （一个干部谈的长征故事）
    冷冰记
    三五年，我在红军一方面军当炮兵连长。
    六月间，我们准备好过草地了。道路全是些山树枝（注一），行起军来比上天还难。我们原来比较重的难运的武器，这时候都秘密地埋藏了起来：譬如我那一连，现在除过一两门小山炮以外，差不多就是迫击炮了。一次，在四川和甘肃刚搭界的地方，辣子口那里，我们和白军打了一战。没有怎个煞力，就夺取了一个敌人的炮兵阵地。堡垒里面，有二十多箱迫击炮弹，每箱四颗四颗的，全是顶呱呱的鱼形弹。指导员——一位江西老表，和我检查了一下炮弹。当然要带走；实在话，在十年内战中，好多我们的武器弹药，还不都是蒋介石当运输队长，由他部下“运”给我们的。
    我们同时也抓了些俘虏。按平时，抓到的俘虏，解除武装，讲讲话，开导开导他们的脑筋，就放了的。可是，这次抓到的俘虏，指导员高矮不主张放。他说：“这些炮弹，一定要叫俘虏们背”。“要得，要叫俘虏背就叫俘虏背吧”！我那阵子办事就是“泡毛”（注二），不习惯在脑门子里打转儿，晓不得这件事里面又有啥子“道号儿”（注三），同意指导员的办法就是。
    每个俘虏一箱两箱的，一家伙炮弹就分派完了。剩下一部分俘虏，指导员又叫放了回去。
    一切就这样子处理了，继续向西面行军。
    第三天，我们到了老虎咀，那已经归甘肃省管了，是一个很险要的地方：山口子很窄，白水河靠左边流过，靠右边的小道，是行人来往惟一道路。要是通过了老虎咀，一翻山梁就到临潭县城。因为是这样一个重要隘口，白军就在左边的山堡儿上，搞了一道工事，居高扼守，我们的队伍要通过这个隘口，自然就得把敌人的阵地给轰垮台，才办得到。这就得依靠炮兵的火力啦。
    居然，我们的炮兵阵地，在右边山峁子上，很顺当的建立了起来。我很奇怪，当我们挖工事的时候，白军只打了两次机关枪，因为隔得远，打不拢就再也不吭声了。为什么不打炮呢？自然罗！就是打炮我们的工事还是要搞起来的。但那样总可以给我们挨时间嘛。真不晓得龟儿子们又在搞啥子明堂啦。
    工事搞起来后，敌人还是静悄悄的，我和指导员都打了望远镜，清清楚楚的看到了白军的战壕，连机关枪巢和指挥部掩体，也明明白白的摆在那儿。不管三七二十几，对准敌人的目标，我们就架起炮来。一面通知我们的机枪连，调过来准备打“接应”。
    正在摆炮的时候，嗨！白军叫唤开啦，声音拖得长长地：“你们是麻雀扒糠头——空的；你们的炮打不响的哟！”我真给闹糊涂啦。我想：“麻你妈的‘ｋｕāｎｇ＠①子石’（注四）去吧！你他妈的又不是玉皇娘娘的咀；你有啥子把柄说我的炮打不响？……”正在这时候，站在旁边的指导员笑了。
    他告诉我，他早晓得在辣子口缴获的炮弹是假的，打不叫的。他说：“现在，用我们自己的炮弹开火吧，直射，弹屁股上多加一个药包。”我越听越气，立即命令开炮。
    轰隆隆隆……，一排子炮打过去了。只看见对沟山上全是烟尘，烟尘里，麻麻渣渣的敌人在乱跑乱窜，好象偶然惊动了蜂窝的蜂子一样。
    第四次排炮以后，我们的机枪连已经在山道上接应上啦。机枪声里，好多白军，象在比赛打“空心仰滚儿”（注五）一样；只是打下去，就不再见翻起来。大约莫半个钟头，我们的队伍已经在老虎咀上安全的挺进着。残剩的白军，早吓得调转屁股就跑了。
    当天晚上，我们胜利到达预期的宿营地宿营。这时候，才知道白军没有炮兵。据说，白军的炮兵，在进甘肃的时候撤消了的：一方面，白军的烟灰太多，山地里搬不动炮；另外，那样的山路，他们认为炮兵的作用不大。
    睡上床后，江西老表又给我说，他知道敌人的诡计，葫芦里卖的啥子药。他说：“我是上过敌人同样的当的，我认得那些假炮弹。”
    我问他：“那你搬运那些假炮弹干卵子用？”
    他说：“作用可大啦”。他说敌人的计策是：一方面要我们搬运那些假炮弹，好疲劳我们的兵力；再方面，使我们在受骗当中，都闹成假炮弹，到时就彼此都没有了炮兵火力，谁也占不了谁的便宜。所以我们要硬着腰干搬炮弹，正是使自己不受骗，反而将计就计，使敌人麻痹起来，不提防我们还有炮兵火力。何况，反正炮弹又不是我们自己背的嘛！
    最后，江西老表学着四川腔说：“老哥，你晓得三国时候的孔明吗？这就叫做‘斗智’啥——你这个舅子！”
    注：
    （一）“山树枝”，“树”——四川地方字，读如卡；指深山僻野，又无人烟的地方。
    （二）“泡毛”——不精细，办事泡毛即办事粗粗糙糙的意思。
    （三）“道号儿”——专指某一事物的内幕。
    （四）“＠子石”——指没有见过大世面的人，与北方人常说的“土包子”相仿。
    （五）“空心仰滚儿”——四肢不着地的连续打滚或翻筋斗。
