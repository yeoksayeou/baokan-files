    The Road to Organizing in the New District
    Kuí Lín
    The newly emancipated peasants in the Shāhé New District urgently require mutual aid in production due to the difficulties they still face with livestock and farm tools. Especially in the context of drought resistance and famine preparedness this year, even more favorable conditions have been created for organizing. Therefore, the waterlogged land in the Sixth and Seventh Districts have cooperated in underground seeding, and the Third and Fourth Districts have also organized in water carrying and planting. The Fourth District mainly relies on the Farmers' Association combined with mutual aid, and later absorbs people who are not in the Farmers' Association to participate. The villages in the Sixth District are mostly grouped by area according to where the masses live, while the Seventh District mostly starts from ditch repair and irrigation. However, because the masses in the New District lack experience in mutual aid and for various other reasons, the mutual aid organization only began to develop after initially solving the following problems:

    I. The issue of voluntary association: Most cadres adopt a task-oriented view when accepting the organization of mutual aid, thinking, "The higher-ups told us to organize mutual aid, so let's do it!" As a result, many were organized through administrative orders. For example, Báicuò Village in the Fourth District was initially organized in this way, but the result was that the mutual aid was not to their liking, and things were used randomly without anyone managing them. Dōnggéquán Village in the Third District did not resolve the leftover issues from last year's autumn harvest mutual aid, but then emphasized organization again. As a result, when harvesting wheat, someone needed a pack frame, but no one wanted to take it out. In addition, emphasis was placed on mutual aid to take care of the orphaned and widowed. In villages such as Běizhǎngxiáqú in the Fourth District, land, livestock, and labor were all evenly distributed, and the orphaned and widowed households were taken care of based on the average land and labor. When the widow in Xiáqú Village was planting, she handed the seeds to someone else and went to buy tofu. The widow in Xiǎotúnqiáo also relied on others to plant her land. The masses were actually dissatisfied because it was not a genuine voluntary mutual aid, so it was difficult to consolidate.

    II. The issue of equivalent value: Because the masses and cadres in the New District lacked mutual aid experience, the problem of inequivalence in the initial organization of mutual aid was widespread. There were several reasons for the inequivalence:

    (1) Labor is not differentiated by strength: In villages such as Zhàngbā, Báicuò in the Fourth District and Xīcuī in the Sixth District, the speed of livestock plowing and waterwheel pulling was inherently different, but they were all equivalent. People were also equivalent, one work-day for another. Those with good labor suffered losses, and although they didn't say anything on the surface, they were not satisfied in their hearts. For example, in Zhào Village and Xǔbǎo in the Seventh District, their own land could have been worked on, but after participating in mutual aid, they had to pay wages to others, which made them very unhappy. Lǐ Wénchéng's mule in Xīcuī was fast. Some households had their own livestock, but they lent it to others and went to use his mule to pull the waterwheel. Wénchéng said, "You think the donkey is slow, so you lend it to others and then come and use my mule. The mule pulls fast, who will give me half a jin more rice?"

    (2) The relationship between middle and poor peasants: Some old middle peasants and newly emancipated poor peasants have deviations in their understanding of mutual aid production, resulting in many abnormal phenomena in mutual aid. For example, in Zhàngbā Village, the newly emancipated households Jǐng Bǎo and Jǐng Chéng used the livestock of the old middle peasant Shēn Héshēng without returning the labor. In Zhèngzhāo Village, the newly emancipated households misused the waterwheel of the old middle peasant, and no one repaired it even when the buckets were broken and couldn't draw water. There were also individual cadres and activists in some villages who wanted to take advantage of the old middle peasants, thinking that this was right. The middle peasants said, "All the peasants in the world are one family, who can be so serious with whom? Anyway, it's good if we can help each other." This not only affects the consolidation and development of mutual aid, but also poses a great obstacle to getting rich.

    (3) Wage issues: In the past, poor peasants provided more labor and needed higher wages, but now the land is about the same. If the wages are too high, it will affect mutual aid. Rèn Guì of Xībālǐzhuāng was afraid of paying wages in mutual aid and wanted to earn some wages by transporting, as a result, his newly distributed seven mu of wheat was not watered well, and the harvest was reduced. However, it is also inappropriate for wages to be too low. For example, the masses in Běizhǎng Village reviewed the mutual aid last autumn and said that the wages were too low, and the opportunistic households took advantage of it.

    III. Leadership issues: Directly applying the experience of the old districts is sometimes useless. For example, in Dōngběiliú Village in the Fifth District, they initially thought that the large-scale mutual aid in the old district was very lively, so they wanted to form large groups. However, when watering seedlings in the shade, the masses only needed four pulleys and one person to change the water, which was only five people, and they could not accept large-scale mutual aid. For example, in Běizhǎng Village, sideline production accounted for a large part of the village's income, but in the beginning, only agricultural mutual aid was emphasized, and the characteristics of combining sideline production were ignored. As a result, agricultural mutual aid was not enthusiastic.

    The above experience proves that the issues of voluntariness and equivalent value are often solved in connection with each other. For example, when Zhàngbā Village reviewed the inequivalence of mutual aid, it was discovered that when the old middle peasants Shēn Héshēng and Shēn Jǐngxīn participated in mutual aid, they thought that they couldn't avoid it, so they participated. Therefore, even if others used their livestock without returning the labor, they didn't say anything (out of fear). Báicuò Village also talked about "being tolerant" and being afraid of being said to be backward in the review of mutual aid. After the review, they realized that if this continued, not only could mutual aid not be done well, but they would also not have the intention to live a good life, which would not benefit anyone. Therefore, they all discussed the method of converting labor into equivalent value and emphasized voluntariness. However, in the initial emphasis on voluntariness, it is easy to form mutual aid between those with labor and those with labor, and between those with livestock and those with livestock. At the same time, households that had suffered losses in the past were unwilling to cooperate with sharp individuals. For example, in Běizhǎng Village, no one wanted to be in the same group with ××× (×× is a basic member of the masses). When Zhàngbā Village solved this problem, it first educated the poor peasants, saying that Shēn Héshēng had livestock and waterwheels, and that in the past, we used his livestock and waterwheels without returning the labor, and now he is unwilling to help each other. Now, we should work for him first, and then let him return the labor to us, so he won't be afraid. After doing this, Shēn Héshēng said, "Who wouldn't want to help each other like this?" From then on, his group was consolidated. In Xuēzhuāng Village in the Seventh District, after announcing voluntary group formation at the conference, no one said anything, but naturally, whoever wanted to cooperate with whom went together and formed thirteen truly voluntary mutual aid groups. Some households did not participate, and it was not emphasized at the time, but it was inconvenient for them to borrow livestock because people first took care of their own group. Then they were individually mobilized, and they also participated. Báicuò, Zhàngbā, and other villages all randomly switched groups or reorganized after the review. In terms of equivalent value, there was a simple distinction between full and half labor and female labor. The ratio of livestock to manual labor was also stipulated, with some being equivalent to one, some to half, and some to two. A small number of groups have begun to move towards more detailed methods of calculating work points, such as Liú Fēngtián's group in Qiǎnjǐng and Pān Cónglóng's group in Xuēzhuāng, which have stipulated different points according to the strength of labor. After the issue of equivalent value has been initially resolved, attention must also be paid to frequent accounting. As Cáo Lǎoshuǐ of Dōngběiliú said, "My experience is that everyone benefits, and mutual aid can be consolidated by frequently calculating accounts."

    Wage issues: Because everyone needs work, even if there are wages to be paid, it is only a small part. Most of them are exchanged for work. Cáo Lǎoshuǐ's group in Dōngběiliú organized female labor to cook and grind flour in exchange for watering the fields, which solved the difficulty of widows who had no labor. Rèn Guì of Xībālǐzhuāng used to be afraid of paying wages, but later mutual aid helped him water the fields. Because there were many people, the watering was faster, and he saved labor. It was also worthwhile for him to return the labor, which solved the problem of being afraid of paying wages.

    In terms of leadership, mutual aid must be developed by letting go and following the mass line. For example, Dōngběiliú was not interested in large-scale mutual aid at the beginning, so it started with small-scale mutual aid for underground seeding. When it came to wheat harvesting and weeding, it naturally turned to large-scale mutual aid. After Běizhǎng Village organized in various aspects such as agriculture, transportation, carrying, and short-term work, the masses quickly took action. It is especially important to have activists leading from the middle. Trade union chairman Cáo Lǎoshuǐ (who is also a hero of emancipation) first did a good job in his own group, using concrete accounting methods (four people can water four mu of land in one day, while two people can only water four mu of land in four days), which influenced and promoted mutual aid throughout the village. In addition, rewarding models is also very important. After Xīcuī Village reviewed the issues of "being tolerant" and inequivalence, six people were recognized for their achievements in summarizing production, and three groups were selected as models. Other groups also actively wanted to compete to be models and achieve merits, which brought the movement to a climax.

    新区组织起来的道路
    奎林
    沙河新区翻身农民，因刚刚翻身，畜力农具上还有不少的困难，所以迫切要求互助生产。特别是在今年的抗旱备荒情况下，更造成了组织起来的有利条件，因此六、七区的水地就在阴地下种中互助起来，三、四区在担水点种中也组织起来，四区多以农会为主结合互助，以后吸收不在农会的人参加。六区各村多是根据群众住的地方按片碰组的，七区则多是从修渠浇地上入手的，但因新区群众缺乏对互助经验和其他种种原因，所以互助组织是初步解决了以下的几个问题后，才开始发展起来：
    一、自愿结合问题：大部干部在接受组织互助时是任务观点，认为上级叫咱组织互助哩，咱就搞吧！于是行政命令编制起来的不少，如四区白错村开始就是编制成的，结果是互助不对心思，东西乱用没人管理。三区东葛泉村没解决去年秋收互助中的遗留问题，便又强调组织起来，结果在割麦时要用个驮架，谁也不愿意往出拿。另外就是强调互助带领孤寡，四区北掌霞渠等村，都是把土地和人畜劳力平衡分配，并按土地劳力平均带领孤寡户。霞渠村寡妇点种时，把种籽交给别人，自己就去买豆腐了，小屯桥寡妇也依靠别人给种地，群众实际上是不满意的，因为不是真正的自愿互助起来，所以就很难巩固。
    二、等价问题：因为新区群众和干部都缺乏互助经验，所以开始组织互助的不等价问题，是普遍存在的。不等价的原因有以下几个：
    （一）工顶工劳力强弱不分：如四区丈八、白错及六区西崔等村，牲口犁地拉水车本来快慢不等，但都是一个顶一个，人和人也是一工顶一工，劳力好的吃了亏，虽然表面上不吭，内心却不满意。如七区赵村、许保，自己的地本来满可以劳动过来，但参加了互助后，还得给别人出工资，心里很不高兴。西崔李文成的骡快，有的户自己有牲口，借给别人用，又去使他的骡子拉水车，文成说，你们嫌驴慢借给别人使，又来用我的骡子，骡子拉的快，谁给俺多出半斤米呢？
    （二）中贫农的关系问题：部分老中农及新翻身的贫农对互助生产的认识上都有偏差，因此在互助中产生不少不正常现象。如丈八村新翻身户景保、景成等，用了老中农申和生的牲口不还工；正招村新翻身户乱用老中农的水车，把斗子都坏的挂不上水来也没人修理；还有些村的个别干部和积极分子，也想在老中农身上找便宜，他们认为这是应该的。而中农说天下农民是一家了，谁和谁还能那么真哩？反正咱们能互助起来就好。这样不但影响互助的巩固和发展，而且对发家致富也是一个很大的阻碍。
    （三）工资问题：过去贫农出工多，工资需要高些，现在土地都差不多。如工资过高就要影响互助，西八里庄任贵的，就是在互助中怕出工资，自己又想运输赚些工资，结果自己新分得的七亩麦子没浇好减少了收成，但是工资太低也不合适，如北掌村群众检讨去年秋天互助时说，工资太低，讨巧户都沾了光。
    三、领导问题：死搬老区的经验，有时候就用不上，如五区东北留村，开始认为老区大互助很热闹，就想搞大组，但群众在阴地浇苗中顶多只用四个辘辘加上一人改水才五个人，不能接受大互助，又如北掌村的副业生产占全村收入的很大部分，但在开始只强调了农业互助，忽视了结合副业的特点，结果是农业互助也不起劲。
    以上经验证明，自愿和等价问题多是互相联系解决的，如丈八村在检讨互助不等价问题时，发现老中农申和生、申景新等户参加互助时，是认为躲不开，参加就参加吧！因此别人使了牲口不还工也不吭声（害怕），白错村检讨互助说心思话中，也谈出了“涵厚”和怕别人说落后而形成不等价的。经过检讨以后，认识了这样下去，不但互助不能搞好，而且光景也没心思过好，对谁也没利。于是都讨论折工等价办法，强调了自愿。但在开始强调自愿中，容易形成有劳力和有劳力的互助，有牲口和有牲口的互助，同时过去吃过亏的户就不愿和尖头在一起互助，如北掌村都不愿和×××在一个组（××是个基本群众）。丈八村解决这个问题时，是先把贫农思想打通，说申和生有牲口、水车，以前咱用人家的牲口和水车不还工，人家现在不愿互助了，现在咱先给他干，以后让他还咱工，他就不怕了。这样搞了以后，申和生说要像这样谁还不愿意互助哩？从此他组就巩固了。七区薛庄村在大会上宣布自愿碰组后，谁也不吭，但很自然的，谁想和谁互助，就走到一起，组成了十三个真正自愿的互助组，有个别户没参加，当时也不强调，但他借用牲口就不方便，因为人家都先顾自己组里用。然后再个别动员，他们也就参加了。白错、丈八等村检讨后都是随便跳组或重新碰组。在等价上一般是全半劳力和妇女劳力有了简单的分别，牲口顶人工也作了规定，有的顶一个，有的顶半个两个不等。有少数组开始走向了较细致的计工折工办法，如浅井刘风田组和薛庄潘从龙组，都按劳力强弱，规定了不同的分，在等价问题得到初步解决以后，还必须注意勤结帐，如东北留曹老水说：“我的经验就是大家都有利，勤算帐互助才能巩固。”
    工资问题：因为大家都需要工，即使有出工资的也是很小一部，大部都是以工顶工，东北留曹老水组组织妇女劳力做饭磨面换工浇地，解决了寡妇没劳力困难，西八里庄任贵的过去怕出工资，后来互助给他浇地，因人多浇的快省了工，他还工也合算，解决了怕出工资问题。
    领导上对组织互助必须放手和走群众路线才能发展起来，如东北留开始对大互助不感兴趣，就先从阴地下种小互助上干起来，到了割麦锄苗时，自然便大互助起来干了。北掌村从农业运输、担挑、短工等各方面组织起来后，群众很快就行动开了，特别是有了积极分子从中领导，更是重要。工会主席曹老水（也是翻身英雄），先搞好本组，用具体算帐办法（四人浇一天地能浇四亩，二人浇四天才浇四亩），影响和推动了全村互助。除此以外，表模立功也很重要，西崔村经检讨了“涵厚”和不等价问题后，在总结生产中，六个人立了功，三个组被选为模范，其他各组也都积极的想争当模范和立功，使运动走向高潮。
