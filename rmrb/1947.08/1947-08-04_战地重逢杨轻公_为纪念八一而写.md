    Battlefield Reunion with Yang Qinggong
    Written in Commemoration of August 1st
    Ke Gang
    At a hero's assembly convened by Liu Bocheng's troops of the Jiang army on the battlefield, I was pleasantly surprised to discover that Yang Qinggong had become a hero of killing enemies. Like all the heroes, he stood solemnly in a standing posture in front of the award platform. However, his complexion was more radiant and joyful than other heroes, his figure was more stalwart and solid than other heroes, and he greeted me with an exceptionally warm gaze. Elementary school students put big red flowers on his chest, and the crowd applauded in waves; the brigade commander put the hero's medal in his hand, and the crowd applauded again.
    From Yang Qinggong's radiant face, I simply couldn't tell that he was the same honest farmer Yang Qinggong from before. Two years ago, during the years when the soldiers and civilians behind enemy lines were struggling against the Japanese invaders, in the Taihang Mountains, in Wangbao Village, which was next to the clear Zhang River and covered with dense jungles, he was my landlord for four years. At that time, he was the most unmanly farmer. He was timid and lazy: he often didn't wash his face for a month or two in the summer, and there was often a lot of sweat dirt accumulated on his ears and eyebrows. He was shirtless, his pants were loosely tied below his navel, and his bloated belly was completely exposed, with traces of sweat weaving an unsightly pattern on his belly. When he worked in the fields, he was both lazy and clumsy. His wife didn't like him and always wanted to find another partner, often scolding him impatiently. His legs trembled, and he stuttered and couldn't say a word. The young people in the village always wanted to shake his head whenever they met him, and he never resisted. His seven-year-old child, Shuyuan, also didn't like him, saying, "My dad isn't stupid, he's just a clumsy blockhead." At that time, in his small house, I invited him to talk for several nights, and I asked him what he was worried about. He didn't say a word for a long time, and he never said why.
    "It's easier to change mountains and rivers than to alter one's nature." Could it be that two years of army life have transformed such a timid farmer into a hero of killing enemies? Isn't this a strange tale?
    After I had a thorough night's talk with hero Yang Qinggong, now I can definitely tell the readers, no, this is not a strange tale, this is a living reality.
    He said, "In the spring of 1945, when I wholeheartedly wanted to join the army, I was only thinking that poor days were too hard to endure. I didn't have any skills, my wife and children didn't like me, and everyone looked down on me, so I might as well join the army. Although I don't know how to fight, I'm not afraid of death. I'll learn slowly, and if I can kill three or two enemies, it'll be worth living these decades, and I'll save face in front of my wife and children." With a look of remembrance, he touched the hero's medal on his chest and continued:
    "Actually, when I first arrived in the army, I was still confused and not very motivated. Although the instructor often gave lessons, my heart was never very bright, and I didn't believe that fighting was for myself. But later, I learned a few more characters, and I became quicker in walking, handling affairs, and speaking. I also became cleaner in dressing, which I learned soon after joining the army."
    Then when did you become more motivated? What kind of energy turned you into a hero?
    He suddenly stood up, and his speech also seemed very articulate. Facing my face, he said: "Last year, when the Self-Defense War was about to begin, I suddenly received a letter from home saying that my family had turned over, the land that had been seized had been returned, and we had also been given some things. We wouldn't have to worry about food and drink anymore! At that time, I really couldn't figure out how this happened. But in a few days, many other people's families also sent letters saying that their families had turned over. And many new soldiers涌ed into the队伍, saying they came to defend the turn over. At the same time, the instructor also gave everyone lessons saying: 'This is the Communist Party and Chairman Mao leading the masses to turn us over! Now Chiang Kai-shek wants to betray the country and doesn't want us to turn over. He wants to attack our liberated areas. In order to protect our fruits of turn over, everyone must be a hero of killing enemies and defeat Chiang Kai-shek's traitorous army!' This was great, the 'trick was only separated by a layer of paper.' After the instructor said this, everyone's hearts were clear and bright, and no one knew how much strength they had when fighting! In the Dayang Lake battle, the enemy concentrated their firepower on my fortification. I held it alone for five hours. When the enemy wanted to escape at dawn, I chased after them and personally captured a prisoner. When I turned back to carry the signal flags, the enemy's tanks rushed over. I threw grenades while carrying three signal flags down. At that time, I wasn't tired or afraid at all. I was only thinking that the traitorous Chiang Kai-shek didn't want me to turn over, and I couldn't let him live well! Later, in the battles of Jinxiang and Pengge, I was always in the forefront to snatch signal flags from places blocked by enemy fire."
    Why did you dare to go into the enemy's fire to snatch signal flags? Aren't you afraid of being hit?
    You can't say that. Who doesn't know that bullets don't recognize people? But at that time, no one would think that way, because seeing our comrades wounded on the front line, and not going to rescue them, that feeling was unbearable! You think, when you're fighting the enemy on the front line, how can comrades distinguish between you and me? I'm fighting for myself, and I'm also fighting for him! He's fighting for himself, and he's also fighting for me! If we can't protect our liberated areas, who else's family can turn over?!"
    He stared at me, smiling, revealing his front teeth, and the hero's medal on his chest shone brightly. I had nothing to say, just tightly held his big hand, muttering: "Qinggong! I never thought! I never thought!"...
    A month later, I met him again on the Yubei front line. He smiled and whispered to me, "The whole village held a meeting to congratulate me, and my Shuyuan's mother was so happy she couldn't say anything. She sent someone to see me the day before yesterday and brought me some things."
    I looked up again at his face, and the color was different from when he was at the hero's assembly. He seemed to be hiding a very deep joy, and I seemed to see a brand new life unfolding before him.

    战地重逢杨轻公
    为纪念八一而写
    柯岗
    在战地，刘伯承蒋军某部所召开的群英大会上，我惊喜的发现杨轻公已成了杀敌英雄，他和所有的英雄们一样，很庄重的用立正姿式站在授奖台的前边。可是他的脸色比别的英雄们更加光彩而愉快，他的身材比别的英雄们更加魁伟而坚实，他用着异常亲热的视线向我打招呼。小学生们把大红花挂在他的胸前，群众一阵鼓掌；旅长把英雄奖章放在他的手里，群众又是一阵鼓掌。
    从杨轻公那光彩焕发的脸上，我简直看不出他会是从前那个老实农民杨轻公了。两年前，在敌后军民正和日寇艰苦抗争的年月里，在太行山中，在那傍着清漳河而又被茂密的丛林笼罩着的王堡村里，他曾经是我历时四年的老房东。那时他是一个最没有男人气魄的农民，他怯弱而又懒惰：夏天里往往个把月不洗脸，耳根和眉梢经常积着许多汗泥，光膀子，裤子松松的束在肚脐下边，虚胖的肚皮完全露在外面，一条条汗流的痕迹在肚皮上，织成了一片难看的花纹，作起庄稼来，又懒又笨。老婆不喜欢他，总想另找对相，常常急燥的骂他，他两腿发抖，嘴里吞吞吐吐说不成话。村里的年轻人只要碰见他总想摇摇他的头，他从不反抗。他那七岁的孩子，树园，也不喜欢他，他说：“俺爹不憨不傻，是个笨圪塔。”当时，在他的小屋里，我曾邀他谈过好几个夜晚，我问他到底忧愁什么？他半天不说一句话，始终说不出所以然。
    “山河易改，秉性难移。”难道两年的军队生活，竟把这样一个怯弱的农民改变成杀敌英雄了吗？这不是奇谈吗？
    当我和英雄杨轻公作了澈夜谈之后，现在我可以肯定的告诉读者，不，这不是奇谈，这是活生生的现实。
    他说：“一九四五年春天，我一心一意要参军的时候，心里光是想着穷日子太难熬，咱也没本事，孩子老婆都不喜欢咱，人人看不起，不胜去参军。虽然咱不会打仗，可是咱不怕死，慢慢学习，万一能打死三两个敌人，总算不白活这几十年，在老婆孩子面前也争口气。”他带着一种回忆的表情，摸着胸前的英雄奖章，接着往下说：
    “其实，刚到队伍上时，自己也还是迷迷糊糊，劲头不大，虽然指导员常给上课，但自己心总不很亮，不相信打仗就是为自己。可是后来总算多识了几个字，走路、办事、说话都快当了一些，穿衣戴帽也干净了一点，这都是参军不久就学会了的。”
    那你到了啥时候才劲头大了呢？到底是那股劲把你变成了英雄呢？
    他忽然站起来，口齿也显得非常伶俐了；对着我的脸说：“去年自卫战争刚要开始的时候，家里忽然写封信来，说家里翻了身，押出去的地都回来啦，另外还分了些东西，今后吃喝再不愁了！当时我实在想不透这是怎么闹的？可是没迟几天连上好多人家里都来信了，都是说家里翻了身。并且有许多新战士涌到队伍里来，他们说他们是为了保卫翻身而来的。同时，指导员也给大家上课说：“这是共产党毛主席领着群众叫咱翻了身！现在蒋介石要卖国，不叫咱们翻身，要进攻咱解放区，咱为了保卫自己翻身果实，人人都要当杀敌英雄，打垮蒋介石的卖国军队！”这一下可好了，“把戏只隔一层纸”，指导员这一讲，大家心里都明明朗朗的透亮了，打起仗来谁也不知道自己有多大劲啦！大杨湖战斗中，敌人集中火力打我的工事，我一个人坚守了五点钟。天明敌人想逃跑，我追上去亲自捉了一个俘虏，回头来我又去背彩号时，敌人的坦克冲过来，我一面打手榴弹，一连背了三个彩号下来。当时一点也不累，也不害怕，只想着老蒋卖国贼不想叫俺翻身，俺也不能叫他好好活着！以后打金乡、打彭格，每次到敌人火力封锁的地方抢彩号，都是我打头阵。”
    你为什么敢到敌人火力下去抢彩号呢？你不怕打住你吗？
    不能这样说，谁不知道子弹不认人呢？可是那时谁也不会这样想的，因为在火线上看到自己的同志们负了伤，而自己要不去抢救他，那心里实在过不去呀！你想在火线上跟敌人拼命的时候，同志之间那能分清你我呢？我为我自己打仗，也是为了他呀！他为他自己打仗，也是为了我呀！要是保不住咱们解放区，谁家还能翻身呢？！”
    他定睛注视着我，微笑着，露着门牙，他胸前的英雄奖章闪闪放光。我无话可说，只是紧握着他的大手，念着：“轻公！想不到呀！想不到！”……
    过了一个月，在豫北前线我又见到了他，他眯眯笑着悄悄对我说：“家里全村开大会给我贺功了，俺树园他娘喜欢的没法说啦，她前天派人来看我，给我送了些东西。”
    我再抬起头来，看看他的脸，那脸色和他在群英大会上不同了，他似乎埋藏着一种很深的喜欢，我似乎看到一种崭新的生活，在他面前展开了。
