Private Grievances Become Public Outrage: Unite to Exterminate Chiang's Troops
Introduction to the Experience of the "Speak Bitterness, Dig Roots" Movement in the Armed Forces

　　After the "Speak Bitterness" movement was universally launched in the armed forces, the soldiers' class consciousness greatly improved, and their fighting will became more resolute, effectively consolidating the armed forces and laying a solid ideological foundation for the great counter-offensive. A lot of experience has been gained in the process of the movement, the main ones being:
　　I. Preparatory Work Before "Speaking Bitterness"
　　1. Deepen mobilization and fermentation. In the mobilization and fermentation, the branch must first carry out vigorous activities, hold multiple branch committees, branch general meetings, and expanded branch committees. All problems must first be resolved in the minds of party members, calling on them to play a leading role among the masses, speak boldly at the general meeting, cry if they want to cry, and ensure that the spirit of the meeting is implemented. At the same time, mobilize backward elements to speak bitterness, one party member guarantees to mobilize one soldier, and it is best to further assign specific tasks.
　　In the mobilization and fermentation, conduct universal enlightenment education for the soldiers. Raise questions such as "Who are we?" "Is poverty and wealth destined?" "Who can we tell our suffering to?" Organize soldiers to discuss, and when necessary, provoke debates, so that the soldiers understand that poverty is caused by exploitation, that everyone is a poor brother, and that they should tell their suffering to the Party and their own brothers, and that this breath cannot be held back any longer. At the same time, read various stories of people who turned their lives around to everyone to inspire soldiers to automatically request to speak bitterness, and constantly carry out small "speak bitterness" sessions in the discussion and fermentation to gradually form a "speak bitterness" upsurge.
　　2. Mobilize backward elements to break through their concerns. In the mobilization and fermentation, a small number of people giggle and don't care, or are indifferent. This small group of people have different types: some are from middle peasant backgrounds, some do small business, some are young and think they have no suffering, or their suffering is not considered suffering compared to others. Some people think that suffering is inevitable, and it cannot be resolved even if they speak out, or they are afraid of losing face if they speak out, etc. The main reason for these backward elements is their blurred class consciousness, and they have not connected other people's suffering to themselves. For example, Wu Zhenya, a soldier from the Second Company of the Third Regiment of a certain brigade in the Hebei-Shandong-Henan Military Region, had his own mother killed by a landlord, and sold his sister during the famine years. But when others spoke bitterness, he kept laughing, because he was only sixteen years old and didn't know that all poor people in the world are one family, and other people's suffering is also his own suffering. The main way to deal with these comrades is to mobilize comrades to debate and study with them, transform them, and help them open up more ways to speak bitterness. For example, Wu Zhenya later became an activist in the "speak bitterness" movement. In short, the best way to deal with backward elements is to strive for them to speak bitterness if they have it, strive for sympathy if they don't, or simply not let them speak. For a small number of landlords and others who deliberately sabotage the "speak bitterness" movement, administrative power can be used to sanction them at the beginning, and after the masses are mobilized, they can be sanctioned through the masses.
　　In the "speak bitterness" movement, soldiers are often shy and afraid of losing face, and are unwilling to tell their greatest suffering, such as their mother remarrying, sisters and wives being raped, etc. Some are afraid that they will cry uncontrollably if they mention it, and some are embarrassed to speak because the targets of past struggles in the same village are now together. Some leaders mobilized them in this way: "All poor people in the world are one family, the parents of poor people are in front of you, tell your suffering to our benefactor Chairman Mao, don't keep it in your stomach and get sick." At the same time, cadres took the lead, and the Party proposed guarantees and prohibited ridicule. Some separated the targets of past struggles, so that new soldiers with suffering could be together, so that they could pour out their suffering without any scruples.
　　3. Discover typical cases and cultivate typical figures. The "speak bitterness" movement needs to be led by typical cases, and attention should be paid to discovering typical cases during the fermentation process. In general, in addition to cadres assigning tasks to participate in soldiers' discussions, report meetings of cadres above the squad level should be held before the "speak bitterness" movement to discover typical cases and study typical cases. Through mass fermentation, mutual enlightenment and education, new typical cases are constantly cultivated. In cultivating typical cases, attention should be paid to: the soldiers' level of awareness is different, their backgrounds are different, and their experiences are different; they do not know how to distinguish between the importance of their own history, or they talk about all the problems at once, which affects everyone's emotions and wastes time. Or they lightly pass over what should be emphasized, and talk a lot about what is not the most painful, so that it does not arouse others' sympathy. However, cadres must never rely solely on their subjective decisions, because there is often a distance between the cadres' ideological understanding and the masses. When cultivating typical cases, it is necessary to always proceed from the masses. At the beginning of the "speak bitterness" movement, in order to break the ice, typical cases can be used in a concentrated way, allowing typical figures to speak continuously, creating a climax and promptly turning to the next stage. Don't be afraid that there will be no way to continue after the typical cases are used up. Facts have proved that as long as the ice is broken, new typical cases will continue to emerge in the angry mood.
　　II. "Speak Bitterness and Seek Justice" Conference
　　When the fermentation is mature and everyone feels that they must speak out, the leadership can seize the opportunity to turn to the "speak bitterness" conference. During the "speak bitterness" period, it is best to stop all cultural and entertainment activities, morning exercises... so that the soldiers can concentrate their energy on recalling their suffering. The venue should be chosen in a shady and quiet place, and the layout should be as solemn as possible, and the slogans should also be targeted at everyone's specific pain. Announce mass discipline before the "speak bitterness" movement, mainly to be solemn and quiet. After the "speak bitterness" movement begins, it is strictly forbidden for visitors and strangers to break in, so as not to disturb the spirit, dilute the grief, and increase concerns. At the beginning of the "speak bitterness" movement, the leadership should try every means to create a solemn atmosphere and inspire the soldiers' grief. Some troops wrote the names of the family members of the soldiers who died in suffering on the spirit tablet, and at the beginning of the "speak bitterness" movement, they first read the spirit tablet and everyone observed a moment of silence. Many soldiers couldn't help kneeling in front of the spirit tablet and crying loudly, and the whole audience also wept. Some suffered a lot due to famine years, so they made a meal of elm leaf rice before the meeting - called famine year rice, which aroused past pain. The soldiers ate and cried, and all started to cry when they spoke.
　　The "speak bitterness" time should not be too long at one time. After the whole company breaks the ice and maintains the climax and each platoon maintains a certain number of typical cases, it can quickly turn to platoon "speak bitterness" to seek universality. In platoon "speak bitterness", some adopt a rotating "speak bitterness" method in which one person speaks for a while and cries so much that they can't continue, and then the second person gets up to speak, which can keep the emotions consistent. However, the leadership must pay attention not to require everyone to speak completely. At the end, those with less suffering may not speak to avoid destroying the emotions. At the same time, soldiers with severe suffering should be given appropriate care, comfort and encouragement during the "speak bitterness" period, so that they can feel the warmth of the revolution.
　　III. Dig the Roots of Bitterness and Make a Determination
　　Dig the roots of bitterness, think of ways, avenge, and make a determination. This stage is an important key to turning grief into strength and raising private grievances to public outrage. It cannot be mechanically separated and must be gradually deepened to induce and enlighten the masses to be conscious. When the "speak bitterness" movement reaches a climax, it is necessary to promptly turn to digging the roots. In the process of digging the roots, it is also necessary to ferment and ignite through activists, cadres taking the lead in demonstrating, organizing soldiers to discuss, and jointly tracing the roots to open up the soldiers' minds. Because the soldiers talk more vividly and specifically, and are more suitable for everyone's level of awareness. In the enlightenment and discussion, it is necessary to start from everyone's specific suffering and the masses' level of understanding, dig one by one, and not be too hasty.
　　Where to start digging the roots? According to the specific situation at the time, various methods can be adopted, or starting from class relations; or from the evolution of social history; or from the evolution of personal history; or from two different regimes... During the process, cadres should make timely conclusions to gradually improve. Many confused concepts in the minds of the masses and the long-term feudal remnants can be swept away and resolved through digging the roots.
　　What to do to avenge the enemies when they are found? After digging the roots, it is necessary to summarize these materials, convene a general meeting to enlighten and mobilize, make a determination to take revenge, and make plans. In the preparation work for the determination meeting, it is necessary to study what determination needs to be overcome and what needs to be praised based on the specific situation of the company. Consciously instill the leadership's intentions into the minds of the activists, and turn them into the masses' own determination through their combination with the masses' fermentation. In the discussion and fermentation, the leadership should grasp well, not say whatever it is and let it flow freely, and timely praise, correct, and help everyone think of ways.
　　When it comes to holding the determination meeting (or the revenge unity meeting), the venue should be solemn and warm. If necessary, ceremonies such as drinking "unity wine" and smoking "determination cigarettes" can be held. Then, according to the situation of the company, various typical cases are organized to express their determination on the spot. Finally, the leadership announces and praises the best individuals, squads, and platoons who have made the best determination, calls on everyone to challenge and make plans, and the movement can move forward to the next step of entering the emulation of meritorious service.

　　私仇成公愤团结歼蒋军
  　部队诉苦挖根运动经验介绍
    诉苦运动在部队中普遍展开后，战士们阶级觉悟大大提高，斗争意志更加坚定，有效地巩固了部队，为大反攻打下坚实的思想基础，运动过程中已获得不少经验，主要的为：
  　一、诉苦前的准备工作
    １、深入动员酝酿，在动员酝酿中，首先支部要进行有力活动，多次召开支委会、支部大会、扩大支委会，一切问题都先打通党员思想，号召他们在群众中起带头作用，在大会上积极发言，大胆诉苦，要哭就哭，保证会场精神贯彻下去，同时动员落后分子诉苦，一个党员保证动员一个战士，最好再具体分工。
    在动员酝酿中，普遍给战士进行启发教育。提出“我们是什么人”？“穷富是不是命该”？“我们有苦向谁诉？”等问题，组织战士讨论，必要时再引起争论，使战士们明确穷是被剥削穷的，大家都是穷弟兄，有苦应该向党和自己弟兄们诉，这口气不能再蹩住了。同时，给大家读各种翻身故事，启发战士自动要求诉苦，在讨论酝酿中不断进行小诉苦，逐渐形成诉苦热潮。
    ２、发动落后分子打破顾虑，在动员酝酿中，有少数人嘻嘻哈哈毫不在乎，或者漠不关心，这一小部分人有这样不同的类型：有中农成份，有做小生意的，年纪小的自以为没有苦，或者是和人家比起来不算苦，也有人以为吃苦是应该的，说出来也不能给解决，或者是说出来怕丢人等等。这类落后分子主要是阶级意识模糊，没有把别人的苦联系到本身来。例如冀鲁豫某旅三团二连战士吴振亚，自己亲娘被地主害死，荒年时又卖了姐姐，可是在别人诉苦时他都不住的笑，原因是年纪小才十六岁，不知道天下穷人是一家，人家的苦也是自己的苦，对待这些同志，主要是发动同志向他们争论研究，转变他们，帮助他们多开苦路，例如吴振亚后来在诉苦中就成了积极分子。总之对待落后分子一般的最好办法是争取他们有苦诉苦，无苦争取同情，或者干脆不让他说。对于少数地主成份及其他有意破坏诉苦的，开始可以用行政力量制裁，群众动员起来后，可通过群众进行制裁。
    在诉苦中战士们往往怕羞嫌丢人，不愿说出自己最大的苦处，例如母亲改嫁，姊妹妻子被奸淫等，有的怕一提起来痛哭流涕不好收摊，有的嫌同一个庄的过去斗争对象现在一起不好意思说，有些领导上便这样动员：“天下穷人是一家，穷人的爹娘在眼前，向恩人毛主席好好的诉吧，不要窝在肚里成了病”。同时干部带头，党内提出来保证，禁止讥笑，有的把过去的斗争对象隔离，让有苦的新战士在一起，以便毫无顾忌的倾诉。
    ３、发现典型培养典型，诉苦需要通过典型来带头，酝酿过程中就应注意发现典型。一般的除了干部分工参加战士讨论外，在诉苦前再召开班以上的干部汇报，从汇报中发现典型，研究典型。通过群众酝酿，互相启发教育，不断培养新典型。在培养典型中应注意到：战士觉悟程度不同，出身不同，体验不同；对于自己的历史不知道分开轻重，或者把所有问题都谈一遍，结果影响大家情绪，浪费时间。或者该着重谈的轻轻放过，不是最苦的谈得很多，以致引不起别人同情，但又决不能专凭干部主观决定，因为干部的思想认识和群众往往是有距离的，培养典型时必须时时从群众出发。诉苦开始时，为了轰开局面，可以集中使用典型，让典型连续发言，造成高潮及时转入下一阶段。不要怕把典型用完以后没办法，事实证明，只要轰开局面，在愤激的情绪下，新的典型会不断涌现。
    二、诉苦伸冤大会
    酝酿成熟都感到不说不成时，领导上就可抓紧火候转入诉苦大会。诉苦期间最好停止一切文化娱乐活动，早操………使战士把精神集中到回忆苦处上去。会场要选择阴凉僻静的地方，布置要力求严肃，标语也要针对大家的具体痛苦。诉苦前宣布群众纪律，主要是庄严肃静，诉苦开始后严禁参观及生人闯入，以免扰乱情精冲淡悲痛增加顾虑。在开始诉苦时，领导上要想尽各种办法造成沉痛气氛启发战士哀思，有些部队把受苦而死的战士家属名字写在灵牌上，诉苦开始时先念过灵牌全体致默哀。许多战士便情不自尽的跪在灵牌前嚎啕大哭，全场也都跟着泣不成声。有的因为灾荒年受苦多，便在开会前做了一顿榆叶饭——叫做荒年饭，引起过去的痛苦，战士们边吃边流泪，一诉就都哭起来了。
    诉苦时间一次不宜太长，全连轰开局面在保持高潮和各排保持一定数量典型的条件下，便可迅速转入排诉，以求普遍。在排诉时，有些采用一个人诉了一段哭得诉不下去时，第二个起来诉的轮诉方式，可以使情绪始终贯彻。但领导上须注意不一定要求每人全诉，到最后苦少的可以不诉以免破坏情绪。同时对苦情重的战士，在诉苦期间要给予适当照顾，安慰鼓励，使他们感到革命的温暖。
    三、挖苦根下决心
    挖苦根、想办法、报仇下决心，这一阶段是把悲痛变为力量，把私仇提高到公愤的重要关键，不能机械分开，必须逐步深入诱导启发群众自觉。诉苦达到高潮时，就须及时转入挖根，挖根过程中，也必须通过积极分子酝酿点火，干部带头示范，组织战士讨论，共同追根才能打通战士思想。因为战士自己谈得更生动更具体，更适合于大家的觉悟程度。在启发讨论中要从每个人具体苦处和群众的认识水平出发，一个个挖，不可操之过急。
    挖根从那里着手？可根据当时具体情况，采用多种多样办法，或从阶级关系着手；或从社会历史演变；或从个人历史演变；或者从两个不同政权……进行中干部及时作结论，以便逐步提高。群众思想上的许多糊涂观念，及长期的封建余毒，都可经过挖根扫除解决。
    仇人找到了怎样报仇？挖完了根，就须把这些材料作总结，召开大会启发动员复仇下决心订计划。在决心会的准备工作中，需要根据本连具体情况，研究出要决心克服什么表扬什么。把领导意图有意识的贯注在积极分子的思想里，通过他们结合群众酝酿，变为群众自己的决心。在讨论酝酿中，领导上要很好掌握，不能说啥是啥任其自流，及时表扬修正帮助大家想办法。
    到了开决心大会（或叫复仇团结大会）时，会场中要搞得庄严热烈，必要时还可以举行喝“齐心酒”吸“决心烟”等仪式，然后根据连队情况组织各种典型当场表示决心。最后领导上把下决心最好的个人、班、排予以公布表扬，号召大家挑战订计划，运动就可以向前进一步转入立功竞赛。（本报资料室）
