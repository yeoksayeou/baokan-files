    Looking at a Mutual Aid Team Through One Person
    Futing
    Voluntary Association and Reorganization
    The mutual aid teams in Nanyicheng, Jincheng, were organized by administrative order in the past. They did work without paying wages, and everything was owed by the cadres. Therefore, they collapsed last year. This left a deep impression on the masses: "Mutual aid leads to losses, it only benefits the cadres." This spring plowing began, and the village political director Sanwang felt that there was a lot of land and few people in the village. If they were not organized, it would be difficult to cultivate the land well. So he called on everyone to organize mutual aid. Because the problems of the past had not been resolved, the masses had no confidence in the mutual aid teams and were unwilling to participate. He visited and investigated everywhere, understood the concerns of the masses, and convened a meeting of the masses and cadres. He reviewed the past, the cadres admitted their mistakes in front of the masses, settled the accounts of the past, and immediately paid the millet owed by the cadres. Under the principle of voluntary association, they reorganized and formulated disciplines: the affairs of the team must be decided by everyone, no one can be autocratic, but everyone must obey the leadership, and jointly ensure that they do not feign illness, do not be lazy, do not quarrel, do not fight, and do not make others laugh. In order to prevent everyone from being ideologically restrained, it was also proposed that anyone who joins the mutual aid team "is welcome to come, and welcome to leave." Under his influence and call, fourteen mutual aid teams were organized in the entire village in a very short period of time.
    Consultation and Equivalent Exchange
    Sanwang felt that if he wanted to promote the entire village, he must personally participate in a team and achieve results. So he combined eighteen people into a team, and everyone elected him as the leader. In the beginning, they didn't study well, and everyone was paid the same regardless of whether they were full or semi-labor. This made some good workers feel that they were at a disadvantage, and their emotions were low. When they got to the field, they were just so-so, doing things perfunctorily, and some people made excuses to not go to the field. This put the mutual aid team in danger of collapsing. He became anxious and quickly discussed with everyone, solicited their opinions, and stipulated that each day would be divided into five shifts, and work would be calculated according to labor. The strongest laborers could earn up to ten points of work, while the weaker ones were given nine, eight, or five points. Conscripted laborers earned eleven points per day, and militiamen earned twelve points (those conscripted were apportioned according to the labor force of the entire village, and doing work for the conscripted was also work for work). For women who made soles for someone, each ounce of hemp earned one point of work, and each pair of shoe uppers earned two points of work. The price of work was calculated as rice at the current price, and it was settled once at the end of each month. Only in this way did everyone's emotions change again. In order to continuously correct shortcomings, he always had to squat in the crowd with a bowl in his hand during meals to listen to everyone's feedback. Sometimes he got so into it that he missed eating, and his wife waited impatiently at home. Often, before he finished eating, she would wash the pots and bowls and deliberately cause trouble with him. However, in order to do the work well, he never got angry at his wife. As time went on, he felt that constantly missing meals was not a good thing, so he bought a large bowl for visiting neighbors, filled it to the brim, and could never come back after one trip, thus solving the problem. At the same time, he took the time to continuously educate his wife. His wife was also an understanding person, and after explanation, she stopped causing trouble.
    Mobilizing Women to Participate in Mutual Aid
    At the beginning of spring plowing, there were too few livestock in the team. If they relied solely on livestock to plow the land, it would delay planting. Therefore, he proposed mobilizing women to go to the fields and use people to plow. However, everyone had little confidence in this matter, thinking that the women in their village were not used to going to the fields, they had no strength and were shy. No matter how capable a person was, they couldn't mobilize them to come. But Sanwang was determined. He told everyone, "Don't be afraid of difficulties, as long as you have determination." He first went to mobilize his neighbor Jinfa's wife. This woman was shy at first and unwilling to go to the field, saying, "None of the other women have gone, why should I go first? I'll go when they all go." Because she was very active during the mass movement, Sanwang praised and encouraged her based on her past activism. This raised her spirits. Taking advantage of this, Sanwang asked her if she could continue to be a model and lead women to the fields for production during this great production effort. After being asked this, Jinfa's wife felt that she was an activist in the past, how could she fall behind now? So she agreed. After Sanwang mobilized her, he felt that she couldn't do it alone, she needed someone to accompany her. So he mobilized his wife and Jinfa's wife to go to the field. After two days, he convened a women's meeting and praised these two women who went to the field. Under this influence, seven women in his team participated, and they could plow two more acres of land every day. Due to the promotion of his team, women throughout the village went to the fields one after another. In order to consolidate the women's enthusiasm, he patiently cared for them. Because they were just starting to go to the fields, some women couldn't persevere. He also consulted everyone and agreed that those who had just started could work less and rest more, and gradually exercise. In order to encourage them, they could earn more work points, which further increased the women's enthusiasm. Now these women have been trained into a very strong labor force. When the district summarized the semi-annual production work, Jinfa's wife was also selected as a labor hero among women.
    Persuasion and Education to Transform the Lazy
    After retiring from the army, Rong retired soldier Guo Shijun was unwilling to participate in labor. He wandered around every day, relying on the village for preferential treatment in his own affairs, so his relationship with the masses was very bad. After the mutual aid teams were reorganized this year, he also wanted to participate. But because he was lazy in the past, no team wanted him. So he found Sanwang. Sanwang talked to the people in the team, and no one agreed. They all felt that if he joined the team, it would be messed up. So Sanwang repeatedly mobilized everyone, saying: Our team has rules, if he wants to join, he must abide by them. Moreover, he is also a retired soldier of our village. If we can transform him, we can influence other retired soldiers to participate in production, wouldn't that be a good thing? After Sanwang mobilized them like this, everyone felt that it was right and agreed. Sanwang also patiently educated Guo Shijun, first praising his merits on the front line. This encouragement boosted Guo Shijun's morale, and he was determined to unite with the masses. Since he joined the mutual aid team, he has been very active in labor, and everyone has a very good impression of him. Soon the village chief was transferred away, and Sanwang proposed to the masses to elect Guo Shijun as the village chief. The masses agreed very much. After Guo Shijun became the village chief, he became even more motivated, and went to the field every day at dawn. He voluntarily proposed to the masses that he would no longer receive preferential treatment from the masses in the future, and that he would work with the masses on a work-for-work basis. After he changed, he actively mobilized other retired soldiers to learn from him. Under his influence, the other six retired soldiers participated in production, and they all proposed that they would not receive preferential treatment from the masses. The government originally approved Guo Shijun to be exempt from corvée, but this time, when conscripted laborers were sent on a long expedition, he volunteered to lead the way.
    Little Monk's wife is a military family member, and all the affairs of the family rely on the village for preferential treatment. She has never worked in the fields herself, and she spends her days going from one house to another. The villagers call her a lazy woman. This year, she still did not go to the fields. Sanwang thought that such a young woman, in our society, can we still let her be lazy? Cadres should be responsible. So he went to mobilize her to join the mutual aid team. Little Monk's wife repeatedly declined, saying: She is not strong enough to do a lot of work, but Sanwang never lost heart, and went to mobilize her two or three times, and finally mobilized her to go to the fields. In order to make her happy, Sanwang also told her: "You don't have to be the same as others, because you are the only one in your family, you can take time off." In this way, she felt less restricted, so she went to the field with others. When she first went, she was still floating and didn't want to work hard. As time went on, under the constant education of Sanwang and the influence of other women, she also exercised to be able to withstand a strong woman to work. One day, Little Monk's wife fell ill. When Sanwang heard about it, he quickly ran around looking for a doctor for her, and comforted her: "You rest for a few days, if you have any difficulties at home, you can ask us to solve them." Sanwang's care for her moved her even more, and she went to the field as soon as she recovered. She also proposed at the mass meeting that she would do her own land and try not to receive preferential treatment from the villagers.
    Elected as a Model, Attributing Credit to the Masses
    The people in the village all felt that Sanwang was a very strange person. He wanted people that other teams didn't want, and after a few days, these people would all be transformed for the better, and the team would be as united as a rock. They would make plans every month and always exceed the task. In fact, there is no mystery. He only has a "heart to serve the people."
    On July 15th, the district held a mutual aid team meeting, and Sanwang's mutual aid team was selected as a model for the entire district. This news quickly spread to Nanyicheng. People were all waving their hands and thumbs, saying: "It's still Sanwang." One day, when the sun was about to set, Sanwang returned from the meeting in the district. As soon as he entered the village, he was surrounded by people, asking questions. Sanwang didn't say anything else, he only told everyone: "This is not my achievement alone, it is everyone's, and it is also under the leadership of the Communist Party. We must continue to move forward."

    从一个人看一个互助组
    辅庭
    自愿结合重新组织
    晋城南义城的互助组，过去是行政命令编起来的，做了工不给工资，都欠在干部身上，因此去年就垮了台。这给群众留下深刻的印象：“互助起来要吃亏，就是对干部有利”。今年春耕开始，村政治主任三旺觉得村里地多人少，若不组织起来，想种好地是很困难的，于是他就号召大家组织互助，因为过去的问题没有解决，群众对互助组很没信心，都不愿参加。他东访问西调查，了解了群众的心事，就召集群众和干部开了个会，把过去做了检讨，干部在群众面前承认了错误，清算了过去的帐目，欠在干部身上的小米，马上都付出来，在自愿结合的原则下，重新组织，并订出了纪律：组内的事情得经过大家决定，谁也不能独裁，但大家也得服从领导，并共同保证，不装病，不偷懒，不吵嘴，不打架，不惹别人笑话。为了怕大家思想上拘束，又提出谁参加互助组“来者欢迎，去者欢送。”在他这样的影响号召下，全村很短时期内，组织起十四个互助组。
    有事商量等价交换
    三旺觉得想要推动全村，必须亲自参加一组做出成绩，于是他就结合了十八个人为一组，大家选他当组长。开始没有很好研究，不分全半劳力都一样顶工，这样有些好把式吃了亏，情绪又低落了。到地里是马马虎虎，应付差事，有的借故有事不到地去，这样互助组有垮台的危险，他着了急，赶快和大家研究讨论，征求大家的意见，订出每天分为五晌，按劳力计工，劳力强者最多顶十分工，弱者定有九、八、五分不等。参战民夫每天顶十一分，民兵顶十二分（参战的按全村劳力摊派，给参战的做活亦是工顶工），妇女们给谁纳鞋底，每纳一两麻顶一工，纳一对鞋面顶两工，有小孩的妇女上地，找老太婆看孩，每天顶三分工。工价按时价作米，每月终清理一次，这样才又把大家的情绪转变过来。他为了继续不断的改正缺点，在吃饭的时候，总要端上碗去蹲到人群中，听大家的反映，有时听热了，就误了吃饭，老婆在家等的不耐烦了，往往不等他吃罢，就洗了锅碗故意和他闹蹩扭，但他为了把工作做好，始终没有到老婆身上发过脾气，日子长了，他觉得常误吃饭总不算一回事，他就买了个串门大碗，盛的满满的，一趟走了可以再不回来，这样就把这个问题解决了，同时他抽空隙不断向老婆进行教育，老婆也是个明白人，经过解释也就不找蹩扭了。
    动员妇女参加互助
    开始春耕，组里牲口太少，如果专依靠牲口犁地，是要耽误下种，以是他提出动员妇女上地，用人犁，但大家对这件事情很没信心，认为咱们村的妇女没有上地习惯，一没力气二害羞，本事再大的人，也动员她们不来，但三旺是有这个决心，他告诉大家说：“不怕世上无难事，只要有决心。”他先去动员他邻家锦法媳妇，这妇女开始觉得害羞不愿上地说：“别的妇女都没去，先教我去，等都去了我再去吧。”因为她群运时很积极，三旺就从她积极的这一段来表扬与鼓励她，这样的提高了她的情绪。趁此，三旺就向她提出在这大生产时候，你能不能继续当个模范领导妇女上地生产，这样一问，锦法媳妇觉得过去自己是个积极分子，现在还能落了后，于是就答应了。三旺把她动员好以后，又觉得光她一个人不行，还得闹个作伴的，这样他又动员他女人和锦法媳妇上了地，过了两天，他又召开了个妇女大会，把这两个上地妇女表扬了一番，在这样影响下，他组里就有七个妇女参加，每天可多犁地二亩。由于他这一组的推动，全村妇女就陆续上地了，为了巩固妇女们的情绪，他很耐心地去关照她们，因为她们都是才开始上地，有些妇女坚持不下来。又商得大家同意，规定了刚上地的可以少劳动多休息，慢慢的来锻炼。又为了鼓励，她们顶工可以多些，这样更把妇女们的情绪提高了。现在这些妇女已经锻炼成了一支很强的劳动力量，全区总结半年生产工作时，锦法媳妇还选为妇女中的劳动英雄。
    说服教育改造懒汉
    荣退军人郭仕俊退伍以后，不愿参加劳动，每天东游西逛，自己的事情多凭村里人优待，因此和群众的关系很不好。今年互助组整理后，他也想参加。但因他过去懒惰，那一组也不愿要他，这样他找到了三旺、三旺和组里人一谈，谁也不同意，都觉得他一到组里怕搞不好，这样三旺又再三的动员大家说：咱组里定的有规矩，他要参加的话，就得遵守，并且他又是咱村的荣退军人，如能改造了他，就能影响其他荣军也都参加生产，这岂不是一件好事。三旺这样一动员，大家觉得很对，都同意了，三旺一面又很耐心的去教育郭仕俊，首先表扬他在前方的功劳。这样一鼓励，提高了郭仕俊的情绪，他下定决心要和群众团结到一块。自他参加互助组后劳动非常积极，大家对他影响很好。不久村长调走了，三旺就向群众提议选郭仕俊担任村长，群众都很赞成。郭仕俊担任了村长后，劲头更大起来，每天天一亮就上了地。他自动的向群众提出，今后再不让群众优待了，和群众做活要一工顶一工，他转变了以后，又积极的去动员别的荣退军人向他学习，在他这样的影响下，其他六个荣军都参加了生产，并且也都提出来不让群众优待，政府原批准郭仕俊不支差，这次民夫远征，他又自动的去带领。
    小和尚媳妇是家军属，家里的事情全靠村上人优待，自己永没到地做过活，成天东家串，西家游，村里人都叫他是懒婆娘，今年他还照常不上地，三旺想，这样的年青妇女，在咱们这样的社会里，还能让她懒下去，当干部的应该负责。他就去动员她参加互助组。小和尚媳妇再三推托说：自己身体不壮不能多做活，但三旺永不灰心，三次两次去动员她，终于把她动员的上地了，三旺为了使他心里愉快，并告诉她说：“你不一定和别人一样，因为你家里就你一个人，你可以抽时间去。”这样她又觉得不很拘束，于是她就和别人一块去地了，刚去时，她还是浮漂不想出力，日子长了，在三旺不断的教育与其他妇女影响下，她也锻炼的能顶住一个健壮妇女做活。一天，小和尚媳妇病倒了，三旺听说就赶快东跑西跑给她找医生，并安慰她说：“你多休息几天，家里有困难提出来大家可以给你解决”。三旺对她这样的关心，更感动了她，病刚好就上地了。她并且在群众会上提出自己的地自己做，尽量不受村人优待。
    当选模范归功群众
    村里的人们，都觉得三旺这个人很奇怪，别组不要的人他都要，而且过几天，这些人都转变好了，组里团结得像一圪＠，月月订出计划，总要超过任务。其实，没有什么奥妙，他只有一颗“为人民服务的心”。
    七月十五日区里召开互助组会议，三旺的互助组被选为全区的模范了，这个消息很快的传到了南义城，人们都是手舞足蹈的挠起了大姆指头说：“还是三旺”。一天太阳快落时，三旺从区里开会回来，一进村就被人们围住了，问东问西，三旺没有说别的，只告诉大家说：“这好不是我一个人的，是咱大家的，也是共产党领导的，咱还要继续前进”。
