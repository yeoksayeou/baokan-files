    Looking at a Mutual Aid Team Through One Person
    Futing
    Voluntary Association and Reorganization
    The mutual aid teams in Nanyicheng, Jincheng, were organized by administrative order in the past. They did work without paying wages, and everything was owed by the cadres. Therefore, they collapsed last year. This left a deep impression on the masses: "Mutual aid leads to losses, it only benefits the cadres." This spring plowing began, and the village political director Sanwang felt that there was a lot of land and few people in the village. If they were not organized, it would be difficult to cultivate the land well. So he called on everyone to organize mutual aid. Because the problems of the past had not been resolved, the masses had no confidence in the mutual aid teams and were unwilling to participate. He visited and investigated everywhere, understood the concerns of the masses, and convened a meeting of the masses and cadres. He reviewed the past, the cadres admitted their mistakes in front of the masses, settled the accounts of the past, and immediately paid the millet owed by the cadres. Under the principle of voluntary association, they reorganized and formulated disciplines: the affairs of the team must be decided by everyone, no one can be autocratic, but everyone must obey the leadership, and jointly ensure that they do not feign illness, do not be lazy, do not quarrel, do not fight, and do not make others laugh. In order to prevent everyone from being ideologically restrained, it was also proposed that anyone who joins the mutual aid team "is welcome to come, and welcome to leave." Under his influence and call, fourteen mutual aid teams were organized in the entire village in a very short period of time.
    Consultation and Equivalent Exchange
    Sanwang felt that if he wanted to promote the entire village, he must personally participate in a team and achieve results. So he combined eighteen people into a team, and everyone elected him as the leader. In the beginning, they didn't study well, and everyone was paid the same regardless of whether they were full or semi-labor. This made some good workers feel that they were at a disadvantage, and their emotions were low. When they got to the field, they were just so-so, doing things perfunctorily, and some people made excuses to not go to the field. This put the mutual aid team in danger of collapsing. He became anxious and quickly discussed with everyone, solicited their opinions, and stipulated that each day would be divided into five shifts, and work would be calculated according to labor. The strongest laborers could earn up to ten points of work, while the weaker ones were given nine, eight, or five points. Conscripted laborers earned eleven points per day, and militiamen earned twelve points (those conscripted were apportioned according to the labor force of the entire village, and doing work for the conscripted was also work for work). For women who made soles for someone, each ounce of hemp earned one point of work, and each pair of shoe uppers earned two points of work. The price of work was calculated as rice at the current price, and it was settled once at the end of each month. Only in this way did everyone's emotions change again. In order to continuously correct shortcomings, he always had to squat in the crowd with a bowl in his hand during meals to listen to everyone's feedback. Sometimes he got so into it that he missed eating, and his wife waited impatiently at home. Often, before he finished eating, she would wash the pots and bowls and deliberately cause trouble with him. However, in order to do the work well, he never got angry at his wife. As time went on, he felt that constantly missing meals was not a good thing, so he bought a large bowl for visiting neighbors, filled it to the brim, and could never come back after one trip, thus solving the problem. At the same time, he took the time to continuously educate his wife. His wife was also an understanding person, and after explanation, she stopped causing trouble.
    Mobilizing Women to Participate in Mutual Aid
    At the beginning of spring plowing, there were too few livestock in the team. If they relied solely on livestock to plow the land, it would delay planting. Therefore, he proposed mobilizing women to go to the fields and use people to plow. However, everyone had little confidence in this matter, thinking that the women in their village were not used to going to the fields, they had no strength and were shy. No matter how capable a person was, they couldn't mobilize them to come. But Sanwang was determined. He told everyone, "Don't be afraid of difficulties, as long as you have determination." He first went to mobilize his neighbor Jinfa's wife. This woman was shy at first and unwilling to go to the field, saying, "None of the other women have gone, why should I go first? I'll go when they all go." Because she was very active during the mass movement, Sanwang praised and encouraged her based on her past activism. This raised her spirits. Taking advantage of this, Sanwang asked her if she could continue to be a model and lead women to the fields for production during this great production effort. After being asked this, Jinfa's wife felt that she was an activist in the past, how could she fall behind now? So she agreed. After Sanwang mobilized her, he felt that she couldn't do it alone, she needed someone to accompany her. So he mobilized his wife and Jinfa's wife to go to the field. After two days, he convened a women's meeting and praised these two women who went to the field. Under this influence, seven women in his team participated, and they could plow two more acres of land every day. Due to the promotion of his team, women throughout the village went to the fields one after another. In order to consolidate the women's enthusiasm, he patiently cared for them. Because they were just starting to go to the fields, some women couldn't persevere. He also consulted everyone and agreed that those who had just started could work less and rest more, and gradually exercise. In order to encourage them, they could earn more work points, which further increased the women's enthusiasm. Now these women have been trained into a very strong labor force. When the district summarized the semi-annual production work, Jinfa's wife was also selected as a labor hero among women.
    Persuasion and Education to Transform the Lazy
    After retiring from the army, Rong retired soldier Guo Shijun was unwilling to participate in labor. He wandered around every day, relying on the village for preferential treatment in his own affairs, so his relationship with the masses was very bad. After the mutual aid teams were reorganized this year, he also wanted to participate. But because he was lazy in the past, no team wanted him. So he found Sanwang. Sanwang talked to the people in the team, and no one agreed. They all felt that if he joined the team, it would be messed up. So Sanwang repeatedly mobilized everyone, saying: Our team has rules, if he wants to join, he must abide by them. Moreover, he is also a retired soldier of our village. If we can transform him, we can influence other retired soldiers to participate in production, wouldn't that be a good thing? After Sanwang mobilized them like this, everyone felt that it was right and agreed. Sanwang also patiently educated Guo Shijun, first praising his merits on the front line. This encouragement boosted Guo Shijun's morale, and he was determined to unite with the masses. Since he joined the mutual aid team, he has been very active in labor, and everyone has a very good impression of him. Soon the village chief was transferred away, and Sanwang proposed to the masses to elect Guo Shijun as the village chief. The masses agreed very much. After Guo Shijun became the village chief, he became even more motivated, and went to the field every day at dawn. He voluntarily proposed to the masses that he would no longer receive preferential treatment from the masses in the future, and that he would work with the masses on a work-for-work basis. After he changed, he actively mobilized other retired soldiers to learn from him. Under his influence, the other six retired soldiers participated in production, and they all proposed that they would not receive preferential treatment from the masses. The government originally approved Guo Shijun to be exempt from corv√©e, but this time, when conscripted laborers were sent on a long expedition, he volunteered to lead the way.
    Little Monk's wife is a military family member, and all the affairs of the family rely on the village for preferential treatment. She has never worked in the fields herself, and she spends her days going from one house to another. The villagers call her a lazy woman. This year, she still did not go to the fields. Sanwang thought that such a young woman, in our society, can we still let her be lazy? Cadres should be responsible. So he went to mobilize her to join the mutual aid team. Little Monk's wife repeatedly declined, saying: She is not strong enough to do a lot of work, but Sanwang never lost heart, and went to mobilize her two or three times, and finally mobilized her to go to the fields. In order to make her happy, Sanwang also told her: "You don't have to be the same as others, because you are the only one in your family, you can take time off." In this way, she felt less restricted, so she went to the field with others. When she first went, she was still floating and didn't want to work hard. As time went on, under the constant education of Sanwang and the influence of other women, she also exercised to be able to withstand a strong woman to work. One day, Little Monk's wife fell ill. When Sanwang heard about it, he quickly ran around looking for a doctor for her, and comforted her: "You rest for a few days, if you have any difficulties at home, you can ask us to solve them." Sanwang's care for her moved her even more, and she went to the field as soon as she recovered. She also proposed at the mass meeting that she would do her own land and try not to receive preferential treatment from the villagers.
    Elected as a Model, Attributing Credit to the Masses
    The people in the village all felt that Sanwang was a very strange person. He wanted people that other teams didn't want, and after a few days, these people would all be transformed for the better, and the team would be as united as a rock. They would make plans every month and always exceed the task. In fact, there is no mystery. He only has a "heart to serve the people."
    On July 15th, the district held a mutual aid team meeting, and Sanwang's mutual aid team was selected as a model for the entire district. This news quickly spread to Nanyicheng. People were all waving their hands and thumbs, saying: "It's still Sanwang." One day, when the sun was about to set, Sanwang returned from the meeting in the district. As soon as he entered the village, he was surrounded by people, asking questions. Sanwang didn't say anything else, he only told everyone: "This is not my achievement alone, it is everyone's, and it is also under the leadership of the Communist Party. We must continue to move forward."
