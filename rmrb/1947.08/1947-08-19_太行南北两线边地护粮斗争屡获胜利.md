Xinhua News Agency, Jinji Luyu, 17th: Fierce grain protection battles have unfolded in the border areas of the northern and southern Taihang Mountains. From late June to the end of July, the local armed forces in the Jinzhong District of the Northwest Hebei line fought 27 battles, killing or wounding 267 enemy and puppet soldiers who were seizing grain, and capturing 84 alive, inflicting serious blows on the grain-grabbing enemy. The Yuci Independent Battalion created a model small-scale annihilation battle. On July 19th, the unit ambushed the enemy in the Yangliang area of the county. When a company of the Yan puppet police force stationed at the Beipiao Railway Station entered the ambush circle, shouts of killing rose, and the enemy screamed and fled in panic. The battle was resolved within twenty minutes. Only two of the Yan puppet company managed to escape, and we suffered only one minor injury. On the 17th of last month, over 500 enemy soldiers of the 9th Column from Taigu County rushed to Dongli Village to seize grain. A part of our Taigu Independent Battalion blocked the enemy head-on, while another part outflanked the enemy's rear, encircling and annihilating the enemy, killing, wounding, and capturing more than 60 enemy soldiers and seizing two machine guns. The Huolu Independent Battalion won three consecutive victories in mid-last month, recovering more than 10,000 catties of grain. The local armed forces in the Anyang, Tangyin, Huixian, and Xinxiang areas of the southern line adopted continuous defense tactics to strike the enemy. Recently, the enemy in Huixian County adopted the method of concentrating forces to make a breakthrough at one point and surround an area (four or five villages) to seize grain and conscript men. On the 11th of last month, the enemy rushed to the North and South Guan Villages. Our joint defense militia quickly gathered more than 300 people, flocking to the area, and shouts of seizing arose, causing the enemy to flee in panic. Our militia then intercepted them everywhere. On the 15th of last month, the enemy once again crossed out to commit crimes and were surrounded by our militia joint defense in Beiyunmen and other villages, where more than 30 enemy soldiers were wiped out, causing the enemy to "try to steal a chicken but lose the bait instead," and severely dampening their arrogance in seizing grain.
