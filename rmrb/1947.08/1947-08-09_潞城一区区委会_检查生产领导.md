    Lucheng First District Committee
    Inspects Production Leadership
    [This newspaper Lucheng News] After the heavy rain on the 28th of last month, the First District Committee of Lucheng immediately held an emergency meeting of all district cadres to discuss the previous work. Each cadre made a detailed self-criticism on their ideological style. Comrade Shen Yu@ said, "I thought I was doing a good job, but I didn't expect to be focusing on the negative aspects. After rushing to sow, most of the seedlings have been caught, but the positive aspects of protecting the seedlings were neglected. Simply focusing on saving is grasping the small end and letting go of the big end." Comrade Chen Zanghai criticized himself, saying: "The people say that our seedlings are good, which led to complacency and relaxation in protecting the seedlings, only telling the masses to collect vegetables to save. If we put our efforts into protecting and watering the seedlings, and applying topdressing fertilizer, each mu could yield two more dou of grain. Watering a hundred seedlings to life in a day is much better than collecting five days of wild vegetables." Chen Maotuan, secretary of the District Committee, said: "Our foundation is to catch the seedlings. The central task should be to focus on the seedlings, so that the seedlings that have been caught can be preserved and survive, and more grain can be harvested. This is the positive aspect. Saving should not be abandoned either. Increase production first, save second. The overall goal is to focus on grain. Increasing production is for harvesting more grain, and saving is also for saving more surplus grain." Then everyone conducted a major inspection and found that there were still 3.937 mu in Chengguan, more than 70 mu in Nanchui, 40-50 mu in Nanbeizhuang, 1.7 mu in Qiangcheng, and more than 70 mu in Wulihou that were either not planted or had incomplete seedlings. Based on the current situation, six tasks were decided: 1. Rush to replant and leave no mu of wasteland; 2. Apply more topdressing fertilizer to harvest more grain; 3. Accumulate wheat field fertilizer to prepare for expanding wheat fields; 4. Continue to carry out the sixty-day textile movement, each woman should complete four jin of cloth; 5. Take time to engage in sideline occupations, so that everyone can make the most of their talents; 6. Sort out village finances, check for hidden problems, and overcome waste. The focus of these six tasks is on replanting, applying topdressing fertilizer, and weeding, because they have time constraints. At the same time, the current thoughts of the masses were studied, and the slogans were put forward: "Pick yourself up when you fall, don't let the government come to the rescue. Relying on heaven and relying on others is not as good as relying on yourself. Labor and weeding can yield millet." Some farmers said that transportation is hot now, and earning less money is not as good as not doing it. To overcome this idea, it was proposed that "marrying a wife is better than holding a funeral, earning less is better than not earning anything." In textiles, it was proposed that "weave one more chi of cloth, and you will be less hungry in the future." Finally, all the cadres unanimously decided to perform meritorious service for the people in this period of work, adding merit to merit. Everyone went to the countryside overnight with great enthusiasm. (Chen Zhenhua)

    潞城一区区委会
    检查生产领导
    【本报潞城讯】上月二十八普降透雨后，一区区委会随即召开全区干部紧急会议，讨论上一段工作，各个干部在思想作风上做了详细的检讨，申玉＠同志说：“满认为搞的漂亮，不想又抓的是消极面，突击下种后大部苗已捉住，但忽视了保苗的积极面，单纯的抓节约一面，这是抓了小头放了大头”。陈赃孩同志检讨说：老百姓都说咱这块苗子好，这是自满思想，放松了保苗，而只叫群众打菜节约，若把力量放在保苗浇苗上追肥上每亩能多增二斗产量，一天浇活一百颗苗也比打五天野菜强得多。区委书记陈毛团同志说：我们的基础是捉住苗了，中心工作应是对准苗，使已经捉住的苗能保存活，而且更能多打粮食，这是积极的一面，节约也不应当放弃，应是增产第一，节约第二，总的目标是从粮食着眼，增产是为了多打粮食，节约也是为了多长余粮食。接着大家进行了大检查，发现城关还有三顷九十三亩七分，南垂七十余亩，南北庄四五十亩，羌城一顷七十余亩，五里后七十余亩，有的是没有种上，有的是苗不齐全，根据目前情况，决议六项工作：一、突击补种不留一亩荒地；二、多上追肥多打粮食；三、积麦地肥准备扩大麦田；四、继续开展六十日纺织运动，每个妇女要完成四斤布；五、抽空搞副业，做到人尽其其才，才尽其用；六、整理村财政，检查埋伏，克服浪费，这六项工作的重点是补种上追肥锄苗，因为他有时间性的限制。同时又研究了目前群众的几种思想，提出了口号：“自己跌倒自己起，不让政府来救济，靠天靠人不如靠自己，劳动锄苗就能有小米”，有的农民说，现在运输是天气热，又赚钱少，还不如不搞。克服这种思想提出“娶媳妇比发丧强，少赚钱总比不赚强，”在纺织上提出“多织一尺布，将来少饿肚。”最后全体干部一致决议，要在这一段工作中为民立功，功上加功，大家抱着极大热情，连夜赶下乡去。（陈振华）
