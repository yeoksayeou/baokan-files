　　Liu Shigang Rectifies Mutual Aid
  　Voluntary Combination for Rush Weeding
    [Our reporter group's dispatch from the 13th] Liu Shigang Village in Shahe is rectifying mutual aid, disbanding the previously forced mutual aid forms, and reorganizing them on a voluntary basis for rush weeding. Last year, during the autumn harvest and planting, the village formed twenty-eight mutual aid groups based on streets, lanes, and plots of land. At that time, the masses thought mutual aid was a government order, and they had to participate. As a result, they outwardly participated but inwardly did not, only helping during rush tasks, such as cotton planting. The village head and the chairman of the farmers' association often promoted the idea that mutual aid could save labor, but that was the end of it. To rectify mutual aid in the village, the leadership convened a meeting of the twenty-eight group leaders on the first of this month. First, they discussed whether mutual aid was beneficial. Everyone shared their concerns. Some said, "Mutual aid means more land to cover, and weeds grow fast in the hot weather. Everyone wants to weed their own land first!" Others said, "I can weed as much as half a person. If I weed my own land, I'm afraid people will call me selfish. If I weed for others, I don't want to put in so much effort. Isn't that less work done?" Zhang Guangquan said, "With mutual aid, I'm afraid of being taken advantage of and of resentment! Our group of three, I harvested twelve mu and eight fen of wheat for others for free this May. At that time, we harvested and threshed together without keeping accounts. When I mentioned it, they said I wasn't generous enough!" This resonated with everyone's experiences of being taken advantage of, and they naturally reviewed the disadvantages of the past forced organization, saying, "Working together requires compatible personalities and intentions. Otherwise, it won't work well!" At this point, the leadership guided everyone to discuss "How can we improve mutual aid?" Some said, "People here are rigid-minded, and administrative orders are necessary!" Xue Jitang said, "Mutual aid requires compatible intentions. If we break up the groups and freely find partners, we can do a good job." Everyone agreed with this idea. The next day, they convened a general meeting, explaining that this round of mutual aid was based on free association, and those who didn't want to participate didn't have to. Everyone started looking for partners, and twenty-seven groups were formed that evening, freely discussing wages, work credits, and equivalent values. Zhang Guangxin's group decided to weed whoever's seedlings were largest first. Shi Zhongming and five other groups discussed combining agriculture and sideline occupations, extracting twenty head of livestock to transport salt, with profits distributed seven-tenths to the livestock and three-tenths to the people. Zhang Zhonglin said, "When we were organized in the past, our group included three households being struggled against, which really bothered me. This time, I want to find eight emancipated households. We want to help each other for thirty years!" Everyone's enthusiasm was very high. After the meeting, they immediately rushed to weed the seedlings. The village's one hundred and fifty full laborers and eighty half laborers weeded all one thousand one hundred mu of seedlings in three days. (Xin Sheng)

　　刘石岗整顿互助
  　自愿结合突击锄苗
    【本报记者团十三日电】沙河刘石岗村整顿互助，解散过去强迫编制的互助形式，重新自愿结合起来，突击锄苗。该村在去年秋收秋耕中，就按大街小巷、一片一片的结合起二十八个互助组，当时群众认为互助是政府命令，不互助不行，结果明互助暗不互助、只在突击任务，如点棉时才去互助一下。村长与农会主席常和群众宣传互助能省工，说了也就完了。领导上为了整顿该村互助，在本月一号召集二十八个组长开会，首先讨论互助有没有好处？大家全把心事谈了谈，有的说：“互助起来地就很多，暑伏天草长的快，谁也想先锄自己的！”有的说：“我锄地能顶个半人，给自己锄走到前边，怕人说自私。给别人锄又不想用这么大劲，这还不是少作了活吗？”张广泉说：“互助我一怕背伤（吃亏）、二怕背气！俺组三个人，今年五月我白给人家割了十二亩八分麦子，那时是伙割伙收，没有记帐。我提了提，人家还说我不够涵厚！”这样一说引起大家吃亏背伤的共鸣，便很自然地检讨出过去硬编的坏处说：“本来作活要碰脾气、对心思，不这样就搞不好！”这时候领导上就引导大家讨论“怎样才能搞好互助？”有的说：“这里人脑筋死，非行政命令不行！”薛继堂说：“互助要对心思，咱们打乱自由碰头，就能做好，”大家都同意这个意见。第二天便召开全体大会，说明这次闹互助是自由碰头，不愿参加的就不参加，大家都找起对象来，一晚上结合了二十七组，自由讨论工资、折工、等价等问题。张广信组决定谁的苗大，先给谁锄，石中明等五个组讨论农副业结合起来，抽出二十头牲口运盐，所得红利，牲口和人七三分红，张中林说：“过去编制的时候，我组编了三个被斗户，我实在心烦，这次我要找八个翻身户，我们要互助三十年！”大家情绪非常高涨，会后马上突击锄苗，全村一百五十个全劳力，八十个半劳力，一千一百亩小苗三天就锄完了。（信生）
