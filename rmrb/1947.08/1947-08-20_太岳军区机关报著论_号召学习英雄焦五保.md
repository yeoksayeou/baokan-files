Taiyue Military Region Organ Newspaper Publishes Article Calling for Learning from Hero Jiao Wu Bao
[This newspaper Taiyue Sixteenth Electric] The "People's Liberation Army" newspaper of the Taiyue Military Region, under the title "Further Develop the Jiao Wu Bao Movement," published an article calling on the entire army to universally and deeply develop the Jiao Wu Bao movement. The article first introduced the achievements of the Jiao Wu Bao movement since its launch: mutual assistance has been universally promoted in various units, and countless Jiao Wu Bao-type figures and mutual aid groups have emerged. It has been proven in countless battles that Jiao Wu Bao's mutual aid group can not only lead new recruits to win battles, but also achieve great victories and small casualties. It is also the path from individual merit to collective merit. For example, in the Quwo battle, Jiao Wu Bao and other three combat mutual aid groups, ten people captured one hundred and twenty-one people, accounting for more than half of the entire company's achievements. The article then introduced the basic experience of carrying out the Jiao Wu Bao movement, focusing on the importance of following the mass line, establishing typical examples, leading everyone, and making contributions to the people. Finally, it proposed ways to further develop the Jiao Wu Bao movement: (1) First, it is necessary to use and develop past valuable experience, use the method of starting from praising advantages to discover and cultivate typical examples, and use the method of reporting and transmitting good practices to launch and organize competitions to promote work. The Party Committee should personally take action to open up the thinking of cadres, lead the movement, and guide the masses to care for and cultivate typical examples. (2) There are two aspects to pushing the movement further: one is to cherish and improve typical examples, and the other is to popularize typical examples. How to cherish and improve typical examples? The best method is to summarize the typical examples in a timely manner, raise their simple creations to a conscious stage, and make them more consciously contribute to the liberation of the people of the whole country; publicizing this typical summary repeatedly among the masses is also the best method of popularizing typical examples. Coupled with specific plans for organizational work, the typical movement can be better carried out. (3) The reason why the mutual aid and merit-making movement has achieved success in the past is because cadres at all levels are also good at using their brains to study more. In the future, we must further promote it, and constantly investigate and study what obstacles there are on the road of the movement, and how to use the method of promoting positive factors to eliminate them. The movement needs to be improved in which direction, the leaders must be familiar with these aspects in order to achieve ideological leadership, in order to master the several links of making plans, competitions, and summaries in the mutual aid and merit-making movement.

　　太岳军区机关报著论
  　号召学习英雄焦五保
    【本报太岳十六日电】太岳军区“人民解放军”报以“再进一步开展焦五保运动”为题，著论号召全军普遍深入开展焦五保运动。该论首先介绍了焦五保运动开展以来的成绩：各部队普遍提倡互助，涌现了无数焦五保型的人物与互助组。已在无数次的战斗中，证实了焦五保的互助组不仅能带领新兵打胜仗，而且能作到胜利大，伤亡小，同时也是由个人立功走向集体立功的道路。如曲沃战斗中，焦五保等三个战斗互助组，十个人俘虏一百二十一人，占全连战绩的一大半。该文继即介绍开展焦五保运动的基本经验，着重指出走群众路线，树立典型，带领大家，为民立功之重要。最后提出进一步开展焦五保运动的办法：（一）首先要运用和发展过去的宝贵经验，用从表扬优点出发的方法，去发现培养典型，用报上传好的方法，发动组织竞赛，推动工作。党委亲自动手，打通干部思想，领导运动，引导群众关心培养典型。（二）把运动推进一步，有两方面：一方面是珍爱典型，提高典型；一方面是把典型普及下去。怎样珍爱提高典型呢？最好的方法是：及时给典型做总结，把他的朴素创造，提高到自觉阶段，使他更自觉的为解放全国人民立功；把这种典型总结，在群众中反复的宣传，又是普及典型的最好方法。再加上具体的计划组织工作，典型运动便能更好的开展起来。（三）过去所以互助立功运动开展的有成绩，由于各级干部也善于用脑子多研究得来的，今后必须进一步发扬它，经常调查研究运动的道路上有些什么障碍，如何用发扬积极因素的方法去排除他，运动需要向那一方面提高，领导必须熟知这些方面才能做到思想领导，才能掌握和互助立功运动中订计划、竞赛、总结等几个环节。
