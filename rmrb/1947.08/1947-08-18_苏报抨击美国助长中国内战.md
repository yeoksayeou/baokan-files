　　Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 15th: Moscow, 12th – Soviet journalist Pavlov, in an article published in local newspapers on the second anniversary of the signing of the Sino-Soviet Treaty of Friendship and Alliance, pointed out that the U.S. policy of interfering in China’s internal affairs is causing the Chinese people to face the disasters of enslavement and the expansion of civil war. The original article stated: "Weapons and equipment are being continuously shipped from the U.S. to China to supply the Kuomintang army." The article forcefully stated: "U.S. economic intrusion into China has not promoted China's stability and development but has instead promoted its enslavement and transformation into a playground for American monopoly capital." The article also cited Chinese newspapers as saying: "U.S. interference in China's internal affairs is not preventing but fueling the expansion of the Chinese civil war."

　　苏报抨击美国助长中国内战
    【新华社陕北十五日电】莫斯科十二日讯：苏联名记者巴夫洛夫，于中苏友好同盟条约签订两周年之日在此间报纸撰文指出：美国干涉中国内政的政策，正使中国人民面对被人奴役及内战扩大之灾难。原文内称：根据各方消息，“武器与装备，正陆续由美运华供给国民党军队。”该文力称：“美国对华经济侵入并未促进中国之稳定与建议，反而促进其受人奴役与沦为美国垄断资本活动地盘。”该文并援引中国报纸之所谓：“美国干涉中国内政，不是阻止而是助长了中国内战的扩大。”
