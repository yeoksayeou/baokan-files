　　The Children's Corps and the Women's Team Quarrel
　　Wu Linquan

　　The sun was already leaning towards the west. Two wounded soldiers were being carried from Xiangling city. The stretcher bearers from Shi Village received them and ran swiftly, covering twenty *li* in an hour and a half. They arrived at Chen Village while the sun was still a pole high.

　　The Chen Village Women's Team instructor was sitting in the field with the team, spinning cotton. Seeing the stretcher arriving, she shouted to the Women's Team, "Women's Team, come out quickly! We have our own wounded!" She also shouted to the Shi Village stretcher bearers, "Take a rest, we'll take over for you..."

　　The Shi Village stretcher bearers were unwilling to hand over and continued carrying the wounded without responding.

　　The Women's Team chairman, Zhang Zhiying, chased from the west end of the village to the east end before stopping the stretcher. She said, panting, "You've worked hard! It's getting dark, let our Women's Team carry these two wounded soldiers. You go back quickly." Although the Shi Village stretcher bearers were unwilling, they had been stopped and surrounded by the women. They had no choice but to put down the stretcher and let them take over.

　　Liang Chun'e brought over some cooked rice gruel to feed the wounded soldiers. Guo Fumei and Li Oulian fed them fried broad beans one by one, and then filled their dry food bags and lunch boxes. Women continued to gather around, piling towels, socks, and caps around the wounded soldiers. Some even lit cigarettes and put them in the wounded soldiers' mouths.

　　Political Commissar Yao's mother also held her cane and stroked the wounded soldier's head, asking kindly, "Good boy! Are you in pain? What kind of food do you want to eat?"

　　The wounded soldier shook his head, unable to say a word as he looked at the people around him. He was moved to the core by such love.

　　"They were wounded for the sake of the women of Xiangling. Hurry and send them to Zhangcuan! Don't let them suffer any more pain!" Old Mrs. Yao's words carried more weight than a bell in Chen Village. As soon as the words fell, Deng Xiangmei and Deng Xiuyun lifted the wounded soldiers onto their stretchers and headed towards Zhangcuan. A large group of people followed closely behind, some carrying rice gruel, others holding broad beans.

　　They hadn't gone far out of the village when the Children's Corps caught up from behind. Qi Quanjia ran to the front, stopped the stretcher, and negotiated with the Women's Team, "It's our Children's Corps' turn to send the wounded soldiers this time!"

　　The Women's Team began to explain, "We've already carried them for two *li*. You came late, and you're too small to carry them..." Before the Women's Team could finish, the Children's Corps that had caught up started shouting:

　　"The matter of fighting Old Chiang and defending our emancipation cannot be entirely taken over by your Women's Team!"

　　"Who says we can't carry them!"

　　"Participating in the war is everyone's business!"

　　"Can't carry them!? Is our Children's Corps inferior to your Women's Team!"

　　The Women's Team couldn't out-argue the Children's Corps. Zhang Xiuyun said angrily, "You little brats, how can you carry them? You're even hindering others from participating in the war!" This made the Children's Corps argue even more fiercely.

　　"Put them down and see if we can carry them or not!" Some even shouted slogans, "Oppose the Women's Team for cursing people! The democratic government doesn't allow cursing!"

　　The two groups argued on the road, and the stretcher was put down. Old Mrs. Yao could control the Women's Team, but she couldn't persuade the Children's Corps. Finally, the wounded soldier on the stretcher, Pei Zhihu, said:

　　"Neither of you needs to argue. Both the Women's Team and the Children's Corps are model participants in the war. Let the Women's Team carry me today, otherwise you won't be able to carry me away, and we'll be suffering."

　　After this, the Children's Corps let go and said, "Today, we'll listen to the comrade's words and let the Women's Team send him! Tomorrow, we'll put up slogans in the village and fight the Women's Team. The Women's Team looks down on our Children's Corps..."

　　The Women's Team carried the stretcher and rushed to Zhangcuan like a puff of smoke.

　　The next day, the Children's Corps gathered to make trouble with the Women's Team, and the school teacher couldn't stop them. They had no choice but to call both groups together to conduct self-criticism. The Women's Team admitted their mistake: they shouldn't have cursed people and looked down on the Children's Corps. The Children's Corps also immediately formally organized three stretchers and jointly decided with the Women's Team that in the future, whenever there were wounded soldiers, the Children's Corps and the Women's Team would take turns sending them. Neither side could take precedence over the other.

　　Thus, this dispute was finally settled.

　　儿童团和妇女队的吵架
    吴林泉
    太阳已经偏过老西了，从襄陵城转下两个彩号。史村的担架，接住就飞跑起来，一个半钟头跑了二十里路。到陈庄时太阳还有一竿高。
    陈庄妇女队的指导员，正在和队坐在场内纺花，见来了担架，一面向妇女队喊：“妇女队的快出来！有咱们自己的挂彩了。”一面向史村的担架喊：“你们休息下，我们换你…………”
    史村的担架不愿叫换，一直抬着走，也不答理一声。
    妇女队的主席，张芝英由村西追到东头，才拉住了那付担架，气呼呼的说：“你们辛苦啦！天黑了，把这两个彩号叫我们妇女队抬吧，你们快回去。”史村的担架虽然不愿意，可是已经被妇女拉住，包围了，只好放下让她们换。
    梁春娥端着熬好的米汤喂彩号喝，郭福梅、李藕莲把炒好的启豆，先一颗一颗喂给彩号吃，然后又替他装满了干粮袋和饭包。陆续围上来的妇女，把手巾、袜子、衬帽、堆满在彩号的周围。更有的把纸烟吸着递进彩号的嘴内。
    姚政委的母亲，也持着拐杖抚摸着彩号的头，亲切的问：“好娃！你痛吗？你想吃什么饭吗？”
    彩号摇了摇头，看见周围的人，一句话也说不出来。被这种热爱直感动的浑身颤栗起来。
    “这都是为了咱们襄陵的妇女挂彩的，赶快往张篡送吧！不要叫他再受疼痛了！”姚老太太在陈庄的妇女中说话，比敲钟还灵。话刚落地，邓香梅和邓秀云的两付担架，把彩号抬起就往张篡送。后面紧跟着一大群人，有的提着米汤，有的拿着面豆。
    刚出村不远，被后面的儿童团赶上了，祁全家跑在最前头，拉住担架向妇女队交涉，“这次彩号该我儿童团送！”
    妇女队开始给解释：“我们已经抬了二里地，你们来的晚，小又抬不动，………”不等妇女队说完，赶上的儿童团就乱嚷起来：
    “打老蒋保卫翻身的事情，不能叫你们妇女队全包了！”
    “谁说我们抬不动！
    参战的事是大家事！
    抬不动！？我们儿童团还不如你们妇女队！”
    妇女队吵不过儿童团了，张秀云生气的说：“你们这些狗籽猫蛋，那能抬得动。还防害别人参战！”这下惹的儿童团吵的更厉害了。
    “你们放下，看我们能抬动抬不动！”有的更喊口号，“反对妇女队骂人！民主政府就不兴骂人！”
    两家在路上争吵起来，担架也放下了，姚老太太能管住妇女队，可说不动儿童团。最后还是担架上的彩号裴之虎说：
    “两家都不用吵了，妇女队和儿童团都是参战模范。今天儿童团让妇女队抬吧，不然你们都抬不走，我们在受罪。”
    经过这一说儿童团把手松开了说：“今天听同志的话，叫妇女队送吧！明天咱们要在村内贴标语，和妇女队斗争。妇女队小看我们儿童团……………”
    妇女队抬着担架，象一股烟样送往张篡去了。
    第二天儿童团集合起来，要和妇女队闹，学校先生挡不住。只好把两家召集到一起，进行检讨。妇女队认了错：不该骂人，看不起儿童团。儿童团也立即正式编了三付担架，和妇女队共同确定，今后凡是有彩号，儿童团和妇女队一家送一回。谁也不能占谁的先。
    这样这场纠纷，才算宁息了。
