Xinhua News Agency, Shandong, 22nd: Under the Chiang government's cover and connivance, the atrocities of American soldiers in Qingdao are becoming increasingly rampant. According to the Qingdao Times on the 3rd, more than ten compatriots were beaten by American soldiers in the last ten days of last month and are still in the Municipal Hospital. One of them, Liu Weitang, died due to excessive blood loss from a bullet wound in his abdomen. According to the same newspaper on the 2nd, on the 31st of last month, American soldiers at the auto repair shop at Pier No. 1 of Qingdao illegally used electric torture, seriously injuring five Chinese workers at the factory, including Shi Zengjin, Guo Wenyi, Chen Yuzhai, Wang Zengfu, and Han Mingxian. When our compatriots screamed in agony, the American soldiers used this as amusement. Chen Yuzhai, in an attempt to break free, was punched heavily in the nose, bleeding and fainting. The American soldiers then took advantage of this to use electric torture again. Only when the current passed through his heart and he lost consciousness did they send him to the Municipal Hospital.

Xinhua News Agency, Shandong, 22nd: Delayed news from Qingdao: Eighty to ninety officers and soldiers from the Chiang family's Eighth Army Qingdao Garrison rushed into the girls' examination hall of the Si Hua Middle School on the 4th of last month, making noise and teasing the students in an ugly manner. The students negotiated several times without success. The officers and soldiers of the unit instead resorted to violence, throwing stones and branches at the students, and rushing into the dormitory to commit violence. Six students were beaten, including four seriously injured. Many doors and windows of the school building were smashed, causing considerable damage.

    【新华社山东二十二日电】在蒋政府包庇纵容下，青岛美军暴行日益猖獗。据三日青岛时报称：仅上月下旬被美军殴伤，目前仍住市民医院的同胞即达十余人之多，其中刘为堂一人已因腹部中弹流血过多毙命。又据该报二日讯：上月三十一日青市大港一号码头汽车修理厂美军，非法滥用电刑，重伤该厂华工石增金、郭文艺、陈玉斋、王曾福、韩明先等五人，当我同胞痛极呼号时，美军则借此作乐。其中陈玉斋因力图挣脱，鼻部被重击一拳，流血晕倒，美军复趁此再用电刑，俟电流通过心脏不省人事时，始将其送交市立医院。
    【新华社山东二十二日电】青岛迟到消息：蒋家第八军青岛留守处官兵八九十人，于上月四日拥入四华中学女生考场，喧哗调戏，丑态百出，学生数度交涉无效，该部官兵反而动武，以石子树枝掷打学生，并冲入宿舍行凶，学生当被殴伤六名，内四名重伤，校舍门窗被砸坏多处，损失颇大。
