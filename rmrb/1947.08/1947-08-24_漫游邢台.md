　　Rambling in Xingtai
    Li Zhuang
　　(I)
    With a sense of exploration, I revisited Xingtai City, which has been liberated for nearly two years, wanting to observe what changes have taken place in the past two years. Entering the West Gate at dusk, the electric lights were already on. Under many streetlights, women of different ages and wearing different clothes were busily turning newly made spinning wheels; many slogans appeared on the walls: "Increase production and practice economy to build up the family business," "Increase production and practice economy to prevent drought and prepare for famine."

    This new impression told me: "Could this be the change?"
    I visited the Guo Erni Textile Group in Lower East Street and got a preliminary answer there.
    Guo Erni lives in a large house with four and a half rooms. The house is filled with all the furniture that an urban commoner should have. A portrait of Chairman Mao hangs on the wall. She is wearing old gray silk pants and rubber rain boots. She excitedly said to me, "These clothes and houses are all fruits of liberation!"
    She is the vice chairman of the street women's association and leads a textile group of eighteen people. She is forty-four years old this year. She has experienced all the exploitation and suffering of the old society, so she looks at least fifty years old. She doesn't want to talk about the painful life of the past, but says with tears in her eyes, "I had nothing at that time. We fled from Longping to Xingtai because of the famine. My father-in-law starved to death in the famine year. My husband, my children, and I survived by eating peanut cakes; the old man couldn't bear it."
    From many comrades, I learned about the suffering she had suffered in the past, which was the same as the suffering of all the poor. I don't want to write more about it here. I asked her, "What did you get during liberation?" "According to my poor state," she said, "I can get a lot. I am a cadre. My family can work, so I just wanted this house, some furniture, and 20,000 yuan, so that the poor brothers who have no labor can get more." This courtyard of hers used to belong to a big evil tyrant, and now it is divided among seven poor families.
    Chen Qin, who is over fifty years old and lives in the same courtyard, is a member of her group. Before liberation, her son died of illness, and her daughter-in-law remarried because of poverty, leaving only Chen Qin and a young granddaughter. Chen was too sick to move. The two of them were about to die, but Xingtai was liberated, and she survived on relief grain; during the land reform, she was allocated three houses, many clothes and furniture, and more than 100,000 yuan in cash, which she deposited in the cooperative. She said to everyone she met, "I have become a landlord too!" The government called for increasing production and practicing economy, so she joined the textile group and spins six taels of cotton every day. She still eats peanut cakes with sorghum, but she has a solid guarantee for the rest of her life. "Did she produce in the past?" Guo Erni frowned and said, "How could she not produce? Like Chen Qin, she was hungry and sick at that time, and she couldn't move if she wanted to produce. Like our family, we ate soybean cakes and rushed to catch the train day and night to be hawkers; we paid rent for the house, and the money we earned was not enough for the interest. We suffered and struggled, and there was no hope at all, so we had no energy to live."
    However, most of the members of her group did not produce in the past. There was a Shen Xiuqin, whose family was very poor. Her mother sold her to the branch manager of Sakakura Foreign Firm as a "concubine." The manager's name was Fan, and he was over eighty years old, while she had just passed twenty; she wore high heels to see operas, and she didn't even eat local white flour. From a lifestyle point of view, she could be considered very wealthy; however, the wealth of life could not make up for the pain of the spirit. She cried and hated, and she often said to people, "I didn't feel any meaning in living at that time!" When Xingtai was liberated, the Fan family ran away, and she lived with two children. Last year, during the land reform, the masses struggled against the things left by the Fan family. She didn't feel heartbroken, but instead accused the enemy and puppet traitors. The masses finally gave her some fruits. She now lives with her mother, who has been thoroughly liberated, and she has learned to weave herself, and can weave one zhang of cloth every day.
    Guo Erni said, "No one would have thought that she could transform like this. She is producing very well now, and she is also practicing economy in her life. She eats millet porridge with sorghum buns every day. The more she produces, the more she will save. She knows that money doesn't come easily."
    Guo Erni's textile group really has all kinds of people. There is a Shen Fangni, who used to be a prostitute, painfully selling her body to make a living, but she didn't want to work; most of the other dozen or so were small vendors. Don't look down on these people's suffering, they didn't want to produce in the past. "Marry a man, marry a man, for clothes and food." If you sell more today, you will eat better; if you earn less tomorrow, you will eat worse. Production seems to be something that has no prospects. Now those who have no capital have capital, and those who only eat and don't work are criticized and satirized. Guo Erni said, "This world doesn't allow you to be bad." I visited this textile group and found that all the tools, only Guo Erni's loom was transported from her hometown, and the rest were newly made. Guo Erni said, "These people have never even seen a spinning wheel before liberation, let alone spin cotton."
    "What method did you use to lead them?"
    She said that after the struggle, many women set up stalls to sell clothes that they couldn't wear. She thought that after selling them, it would be over, so she had to think of a long-term solution. She used to be able to weave, so she chatted with everyone, saying that after wearing洋布 clothes, you have to wear coarse cloth. Now it costs 7,000 yuan to buy a cloth, but if you spin it yourself, it only costs 2,000. Everyone calculated that it was profitable, and they all said, "It's good, but we haven't even seen a spinning wheel." She got a spinning wheel and spun it for everyone to see, earning 3,300 yuan in two days. Then she found four people, gathered some shares, and others only contributed capital, while she contributed both capital and labor, and everyone shared the profits equally, in order to give some benefits to the novices, so everyone became active. At this time, Guo Erni arranged to buy a car and get cotton. Everyone didn't know how, so she started teaching everyone. She repaired all kinds of tools and went whenever she was called. People in the city are lively, and they will do it if there is a profit, and it slowly developed to eighteen people.
    Guo Erni has been completely liberated. She works and produces herself, and can weave three zhang of cloth a day. Her husband works in the cooperative, and her son goes to school. When we were talking, she was still winding thread non-stop, using this method to solve the contradiction between work and production. She made a plan to use this method to enable these urban poor people in her group and street who have never had food for the next day to start a family.
    This is the epitome of the textile industry in Xingtai City. In the first district of the city alone, there are more than 700 newly made spinning wheels like hers, and textiles are just one of the diverse productions of the citizens.

  　(II)
    Hairdressing worker Hao Jigan, after hearing the call of the municipal party committee for increasing production and practicing economy, immediately made a plan to save more than 20,000 yuan a month. To be honest, his austerity measures should have been implemented long ago, such as reducing the seven and a half pounds of wine he had to drink every month, stir-frying less dishes for meals, and changing from paper cigarettes to dry tobacco in the future. However, for urban commoners, these are very difficult. To break the traditional habit of "eat one day, eat one day," "earn more, eat more, earn less, eat less," requires a tortuous process.
    I did not find the opportunity to talk to Hao Jigan, but I talked a lot with another barber named Yang while getting a haircut. It has only been two years since liberation, and he can have such understanding and conversation now, which completely shocked me. His hometown is in the countryside, and his mother and brother have been liberated in this land reform. As a worker, he participated in the urban commoner liberation movement, struggled against traitors, evil bullies, and landlords, and was allocated two houses, a set of clothes and furniture, and a salary of 40,000 yuan in cash. He works as a worker and militiaman, and his wife makes soles for others. "I also have savings," he said. "The money from the fruits of liberation is put into the factory. Now I can save 20,000 yuan a month, and my wife's earnings can take care of herself." His shop practices economy. In the past, there were many seasonings in each meal of noodles. Now, every day, one 米 and one 面 are used, and the seasonings are not added as much as possible, saving a lot of money every month. His wife eats a meal of noodles every three or four days. From a life perspective, it is much more economical than before. "Why couldn't you save in the past?" "People like us couldn't get rich by saving in the past. It's the same to be poor if you eat well, and it's the same to be poor if you eat poorly. No one wants to plan for the long term, and they are happy to live one day at a time. In this industry, standing is three feet shorter than others. After a busy day, my back is sore and my legs are tired. I drink two taels and watch a play. If I have more money, I run to the brothel. Knowing that I am harming myself, that is the world, what can you do?" He said, "After liberation, the poor have a little capital. With money, you can make money and start a family. Who wouldn't want to?" "At this time, the atmosphere has also changed. Whoever wastes it will be criticized by others. Unlike in the past, when people flattered the rich, the government advocated increasing production and practicing economy. Who doesn't know that this is for their own good?"
    He also said: "Although that's what I said, it's really not easy to save in the city. You must get through your thoughts before you can do it. The street cadres go to persuade door to door. If you have sold your son in the past, he will let you think about why you sold your son; if you have been pitted by the interest in the past, he will say that you are not afraid of the interest at this time, so why not save it?" The Communist Party is really thoughtful for the people, and there is nothing that cannot be done."
    Leaving the barbershop, I thought silently; this is really a big project, giving you the foundation and conditions for building a family and starting a business, breaking the old social habits of each person, and promoting people to be good people and do good deeds. This three-part song has changed the thoughts and production habits of urban commoners. How much blood, sweat, and struggle is contained in it.

  　(III)
    With the implementation of economy in the city, some vendors selling food and snacks have lost their jobs, and the issue of organizing their transfer has been brought to the attention of the leading cadres. "Every industry is like a mountain," which is very difficult. A vendor selling cold noodles found Hei Dan, the chairman of the United Association of Fuqian Street: "Chairman, you have to help me solve this difficulty of eating." Hei Dan makes a living by selling old tofu. After hearing the district's instruction of "what you know, lead what you know," he said: "I will teach you how to sell old tofu!" He lent his tools to the cold noodle vendor, taught him how to make it, how to shout, and solved the life of selling cold noodles, and said to everyone he met: "Chairman Hei Dan leads well."
    Then came the second problem. If everyone does this business, this business will not make money. "In the city, production must be diverse." Guo Lianceng was a rickshaw worker. Now no one takes rickshaws. He gathered his group of relatives and friends to think of a way. Some of them knew how to make shoes and quilts, some knew how to make shoe soles, and some knew how to chop firewood... One person taught a few people, learned the technique of "skill never weighs you down," and immediately solved the current life problem. More than twenty of them earned six to seven hundred thousand in three months.
    Some people say that this method itself has a mutual aid nature, and with the leadership's advocacy of "organizing together," it has become popular among the citizens who "take care of each other." Two watermelon vendors used to do their own thing, but now they eat together (saving firewood), buy melons together (saving money), and selecting melons requires skills, and those who know how to help those who don't. Those who sell meat organize together and cook meat together, saving almost half the fire money... From the existing materials in Xingtai, it seems that rickshaw pulling, sewing and washing, selling snacks, making tin foil and other dispensable occupations will inevitably decline. The best way for these people is to seek a way out in handicrafts: weaving mats, making ropes, and those who succeed accumulate some capital to run a business. Ten people in one district jointly ran a business, earning five to six hundred thousand in three months, which is better than the original occupation. One person's resources are limited, and they often do not know the techniques outside of their own industry. "Organizing together" and "helping each other" has become their only way.
    The conditions are difficult, and it is difficult for one person to support a family. The first district created the experience of mobilizing the whole family to produce. Most of the urban poor bring their families, and they are given an account, that women who occupy one-half of the labor force are sitting and waiting to eat, who can afford to support them. The method of calculating accounts is surprising. In the past, the husband set up a stall, and now the wife sets up a stall, and the husband pulls out to sell vegetables and firewood. "It is better to sell by chasing than sitting and selling." Those who can run, run; those who don't run, find those who sit and sell to buy and sell, and the strength of women is brought into play, often more than doubling their income. In the past, sisters-in-law often fought and quarreled over eating and buying snacks, but now they are saving money, and everyone no longer buys them to eat. After production, everyone competes for dividends, and even families that are not harmonious show a new atmosphere.
    Many cadres who lead this work say that to create an atmosphere of increasing production and practicing economy in the city, cadres and activists must take the lead. After liberation, the actions of the poor are all learning from them. It is said that recalling the past and complaining about suffering is the best way to enlighten the class consciousness of these comrades from poor backgrounds and establish their consciousness of building a family and starting a business. Only when their thinking is clear can they lead others. In the past, the habit of the city was that everyone lived in the same courtyard, and maybe they didn't even know the name after half a year. Now, if you want to lead, you must go deep into one household and one person, and think of practical and concrete ways for them. Li, the head of Chang Street, went to Dazhushi. Dazhushi was then controlled by a bad chief. He personally went to the home of a sick old woman to greet her, help her ask a doctor to buy medicine, and even cure the disease. He solved the specific difficulties of sixteen poor people in this way, and established a relationship with the citizens. Everyone realized that he was a good person, and they all listened to him, first struggling against the bad chief, and the movement to increase production and practice economy was launched in that street.

　　漫游邢台
    李庄
　　（一）
    怀着一种探索的心情，重游解放将近两年的邢台城，想观察一下两年来它到底发生了一些什么变化。黄昏入西门，电灯已亮，许多路灯下面，着不同年纪不同衣着的纺妇，紧张的转动新制的纺车；许多标语，出现在墙壁上：“生产节约兴家立业”“生产节约防旱备荒”。
    这个新印象告诉我：“难道这就是变化吗？”
    我访问了下东街的郭二妮纺织组，在那里得出了初步的答案。
    郭二妮住在一座有四间半的大房子里。房子里摆着城市平民应有的一切家具，墙上挂着毛主席像，她穿着旧灰绸裤子，树胶雨鞋，她很兴奋的对我说：“这些住的穿的，都是翻身果实！”
    她是街妇救会副主席，领导着一个包括十八个人的纺织组，今年四十四岁了。她经历过旧社会一切压榨与痛苦，因此从脸上看起来，起码有五十。她不愿谈过去的痛苦生活，只是红着眼圈说：“那时候我什么都没有，我们从隆平逃荒到邢台，老公公在灾荒年饿死了。我、掌柜的、孩子吃花生饼熬过来，他老年人受不了。”
    我从许多同志的口中，了解她过去遭受的苦难，和所有穷人的苦难是相同的，这里不想多写了。我问她：“你在翻身的时候得到些什么？”“照我那个穷劲，”她说：“我可以得到许多，我是干部，一家人可以劳动，就只要了这个房子，一些家具，两万块钱，叫没有劳力的穷弟兄，多分些好。”她这个院子，过去属于一个大奸霸，现在分给七家穷人住着。
    同院五十多岁的陈秦氏，是她的组员，解放以前，儿子病死，儿媳妇因穷改嫁，只剩下陈秦氏和一个小孙女。陈病得不能动，两口人眼看就完了，邢台解放，她靠着救济粮活过来；翻身时，分了三间房子，许多衣服家具，和十多万现款，现款入到合作社。她逢人便说：“我也成了东家了！”政府号召生产节约，她参加了纺织组，每天纺六两花。吃饭仍是花生饼配高粱，但是后半辈子生活有了坚实的保障。“过去她也生产吗？”郭二妮皱着眉说：“怎么不生产呢？像陈秦氏，那时又饿又病，想生产不能动，像我们这一家，吃豆饼，没明没夜的赶火车，当小贩；住房子掏房租，挣的几个还不够利钱，受死受活，没有一点指望，活得也就没劲了。”
    但是她这个组里的成员，过去大部分都是不生产的。有个申秀琴，家里原来很穷，母亲把她卖给坂仓洋行分行经理当“太太”。经理姓范，八十多了，她刚过廿；看戏穿着高跟鞋，本地白面都不吃，从生活上说可算很富裕了；不过生活的富裕，抵不了精神的痛苦，她流泪痛恨，现在还常常对人说：“那时候活得没有一点意思！”解放邢台时，姓范的跑了，她带着两个孩子过活。去年大翻身，群众向她斗出姓范的遗留下的东西，她没有心痛，反转向敌伪汉奸控诉，群众最后也分给她一些果实，她现在和翻透了身的母亲一起生活，自己学会纺织，每天能织一丈布。
    郭二妮说：“谁也想不到，她能转变成这样，她现在生产得挺好，生活也节约了，成天是小米稠饭配高粱窝窝，越是生产，越会节约，生产了才知道钱来的不容易。”
    郭二妮的纺织组里，真是什么人都有。有个申芳妮，过去是破鞋，痛苦的出卖肉体糊口，自己却不愿劳动；其他十几个，大部分是摆小摊的。别看这些人苦，过去可不愿生产。“嫁汉嫁汉，穿衣吃饭。”今天卖的多吃好点，明天赚的少，就吃坏点，生产好像是没出息的事。现在没本钱的有了本钱，光吃不做的受到批评讽刺。郭二妮说：“这个世道不容你不好。”我参观这个纺织组，发现所有工具，只有郭二妮的一架织布机是从老家运来，其余都是新做的。郭二妮说：“这些人别说纺花，解放以前她们连纺车都没见过。”
    “你用什么方法把她们领导起来的？”
    她说，斗争过后，许多妇女摆小摊，卖穿不了的果实衣服。她想卖完就完了，得想个长远的办法。她过去会纺织，就向大家闲扯，洋布衣服穿完了得穿粗布，现在七千元买一个布，自己纺，两千就成。大家算着有利，都说“好是好，可是我们连纺车都没见过呀。”她弄了个纺车，纺给大家看，两天赚了三千三百元，接着找了四个人，集了些股，别人只出资本，她又出资本又出劳力，赚了钱大家均分，为的是给新手一些好处，于是都积极起来了。这时，郭二妮就张罗买车子，弄棉花。大家不会，她便着手教大家。修理各种工具，随叫随去。城里人眼活，有利益就作，慢慢的发展到十八个人。
    郭二妮是翻透身了，她自己又工作又生产，一天能织三丈布，丈夫在合作社里作事，儿子念书。我们谈话的时候，她还手不停歇的缠线子，用这个方法解决了工作与生产的矛盾。她作了个计划，准备用这个方法，使她组中街中这些从来是家无隔日之粮的城市贫民都发起家来。
    这是邢台城纺织事业的缩影。仅城内一区，像她这个组一样新制的纺车，就有七百多辆，而纺织不过是市民多种多样的生产之一。
  　（二）
    理发工人郝纪纲，听了市党委生产节约的号召，马上作了个计划，一个月节约两万多元。老实说，他的节约项目，早就应该实行，譬如减去每月要喝的七斤半酒，吃饭少炒一些菜，以后改纸烟为旱烟之类。但是，放到城市贫民身上，这些却是很困难的。要打破“作一天吃一天”“多赚多吃少挣少吃”的传统习惯，需要经过一段曲折的过程。
    我没有找到和郝纪纲谈话的机会，在理发的时候，却和另一个姓杨的理发工人谈了许多。解放不过两年，他现在能有这样的认识与谈吐，使我完全惊骇了。他的老家在乡下，母亲和哥哥都在这次土地改革中翻了身，他以一个工人的资格，参加了城市贫民翻身运动，斗倒汉奸恶霸地主，分了两间房子，一套衣服家具和工资四万现款。他当工人兼民兵，老婆给人家纳鞋底。“我也有了积蓄了，”他说：“分的果实钱，入到工厂里，现在每月可以剩两万，老婆挣的能顾着她自己。”他的店里实行节约，过去每顿的面，调料很多，现在每天一米一面，调料能不放的就不放，每个月省下好多钱。家里老婆三四天吃一顿面，从生活讲，比从前节约多了。“为什么过去不能节约呢？”“我们这种人过去节约也发不了财。吃好点也穷，吃坏点也穷，谁也不想长期打算，乐得过一天混一天。干这一行，站着比人短三尺，忙上一天腰酸腿困，喝二两看看戏，钱多了跑跑窑。明知道自己害自己，就是那个世道，你有什么办法呢？”他说：“翻罢身，穷人都有点本钱了。有了钱才能生利，能够发家，谁不愿意。”“这时候风气也变了，谁浪费别人就批评，他不像过去净巴结有钱的，政府又提倡生产节约，谁不知道这是为自己好。”
    他又说：“虽然是这么说，在城里节约真不容易，必须打通思想才行。街干部挨门挨户的去劝说，你过去卖过儿子，他就让你想想为什么把儿子都卖了；你过去叫利钱坑光了，他就说这时候不怕利钱了还不好好节约干么？共产党替老百姓算的真周到，没有办不到的事。”
    离开理发铺，我默默的想着；这真是一件大工程，给了你兴家立业的基础与条件，打破各人的旧社会习惯，与人们提倡作好人作好事，这个三部曲就把城市贫民的思想和生产习惯改变了，这里面包含着多少血泪和斗争啦。
  　（三）
    城市实行节约，有些卖饭卖零食的小贩失了业，组织转业的问题于是提到了领导干部的面前。“隔行如隔山”，这是非常困难的。一个卖凉粉的小贩，找到府前街联合会主席黑旦家里：“主席你要帮助我解决这个吃饭的困难。”黑旦靠卖老豆腐为生，他听了区里“会什么领导什么”的指示，就说：“我教你卖老豆腐吧！”他把自己的工具借给卖凉粉的，教给他怎么作，怎么吆喝，卖凉粉的生活解决了，遇人就说：“黑旦主席领导的好。
    接着来了第二个问题，大家都干这个营生，这个营生就不赚钱了。“在城市里，生产必须多种多样”。郭连曾是个洋车工人，现在没有人坐洋车，他把自己的一伙亲友召集起来，大家想办法，有会打鞋被子的，还有会圈鞋底的，有会劈柴的………。一个人教几个，学会“艺不压身”的技术，马上解决了当前的生活问题。他们二十几个人，三个月就赚了六七十万。
    有人说：这种方法本身，就带有互助的性质，再由领导上一提倡“组织起来”，就在“各顾各”的市民中普遍起来了。两个西瓜小贩，过去各干各的，现在合伙吃饭（省柴），合买瓜（省钱），选瓜要技术，会的帮助不会的。卖肉的组织起来，在一起煮肉，几乎省下一半火钱………。从台现有的材料看来，拉洋车、缝洗、卖零食、造锡箔等可有可无的职业，必然衰落，这些人最好的办法，是向手工业方面谋求出路：编席、打绳，成者积集一些资本跑行商。一区有十个人合伙跑行商，三个月赚了五六十万，比原来的职业还要好。一个人资力有限，又常常不会本行以外的技术，“组织起来”“互相帮助”，就成为他们唯一的道路。
    条件困难了，一个人很难养一家。一区创造了动员全家人生产的经验。城市贫民多带家庭，给他们算一笔帐，占二分之一劳力的妇女，坐着等吃，谁能供养的了。算帐的方法，使人大吃一惊。过去丈夫摆小摊，现在由妻子摆，丈夫抽出来卖菜、卖柴。“坐着卖，不如赶着卖”，能跑的跑，不跑的找坐着的卖买，把妇女的力量都发挥出来，往往不止增加一倍的收入。过去妯娌们常为吃饭买零食打架吵嘴，现在节约了，大家都不再买着吃，生产了，大家竞赛分红，不和的家庭，也呈现了一番新气象。
    许多领导这一工作的干部都说：想在城市造成生产节约的风气，还必须干部、积极分子带头。翻身后贫民的一切行动，都在学习他们。据说回忆翻身诉苦追根，是启发这些出身贫苦的同志们的阶级觉悟，建立他们兴家立业自觉的最好办法。他们的思想通了，才能领导别人。城市过去的习惯，是大家住在一个院里，也许过了半年都不知道名字，现在你要领导，必须深入一个户一个人，替他们多想实际而具体的办法。长街李街长到了大珠市，大市当时被一个坏长把握着，他亲自去一个生病的老太太家里问候她，帮她请医生买药，以至把病治好，他像这样解决了十六户贫苦群众的具体困难，和市民们建立了感情，大家体验到他是个好人，都听他的话，先把坏长斗倒，生产节约运动就在那条街开展起来了。
