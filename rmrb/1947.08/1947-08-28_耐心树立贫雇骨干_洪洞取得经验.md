(Our newspaper, Taiyue, 26th dispatch) Hongtong has gained the following experience in the movement to make the poor and hired peasants the backbone: Many villages and cadres look down on the poor and hired peasants. Some people think that they are illiterate and cannot speak well, so it is difficult to lead them, and no one supports them. At the same time, because the leadership and cadres have never paid attention to these people, they themselves do not have much confidence, thinking that they cannot get anything, and it is okay to give them errands to run. For example, a poor peasant in Kongzhai Village, Fourth District, was elected as a member of the Farmers' Association Standing Committee, but actually became a correspondent for the cadres. Therefore, the leadership must constantly educate and support them to make them bold in their work. For example, when the very poor Lao Bai in Sanshi Village was first elected as the chairman of the Farmers' Association, he himself did not have the confidence to do it. The leadership immediately encouraged him and said, "Do it, don't be afraid, we will help you if you can't do it." In the process of his work, some village cadres were not convinced and took the opportunity to satirize him from time to time. When he went home, his wife complained again, which made him very depressed. However, the leadership still supported him and criticized the jealousy of the cadres. Later, he became the most beloved cadre of the masses. Secondly, to cultivate poor and hired peasant cadres, it is necessary to study their history and examine their composition. For example, Li Wanjun, the former chairman of the Farmers' Association in Neitan Village, Third District, was originally impoverished by a feudal rich peasant who exploited him for flour. During the War of Resistance Against Japan, he served as a puppet village chief. After the Japanese surrender, the leadership thought he was a poor peasant and promoted him to be the chairman of the Farmers' Association. As a result, under his protection, as many as five landlords and feudal rich peasants in the village were not liquidated by the masses. He also used private feuds to carry out indiscriminate struggles and apportionments, causing extreme dissatisfaction among the masses with the leadership. Many villages have learned this lesson and first organized poor and hired peasant groups, and then gradually promoted or elected true leaders by the masses through a longer period of struggle and testing. Such hired and poor peasant cadres are always connected with the masses by flesh and blood. Again, generally, hired and poor peasants are forced by life and work all day long to make a living. Any activity will delay production. Therefore, their lives must be properly taken care of so that they can feel at ease and concentrate their efforts. For example, in Jianqiao Village, Second District, there are many very poor peddlers. If they don't carry their burdens for a day, they will starve. The leadership must pay attention to solving this problem.

### 耐心树立贫雇骨干　洪洞取得经验

　　耐心树立贫雇骨干
  　洪洞取得经验
    【本报太岳二十六日电】洪洞以贫雇为骨干运动中，得出如下经验：不少村庄及干部轻视贫雇，有人认为他们不识字，又不会讲话，所以很难领导，没人拥护。同时，由于领导上及干部素不重视这些人，使其自身信心也不大，认为咱什么也摸不着，给咱干个现成跑腿活还可以。如四区孔寨村某贫农被选为农会常委，实际上当了干部的通讯员。因此，领导上必须时时教育与扶植他们，使其大胆的干。如三师村赤贫老白，刚被选上农会主席时，自己也没有信心干。领导上当即鼓励他说：“干吧，不怕，办不了的事有我们帮助你。”在他干的过程中，部分村干部不服，不时趁机讽刺。他回家去，老婆又埋怨，弄得情绪异常低落，而领导上却依然为他撑腰，并批评了干部中的嫉妒心理，后来他成为群众最爱戴的干部了。其次，培养贫雇骨干，必须要研究其历史，审查其成份。如三区内坦村前农会主席李万俊，原从一封建富农吸料面穷的，抗战时期，曾当过伪村长，日本投降后，领导上认为是贫农，便提拔其当农会主席。于是在他包庇之下，全村未被群众清算的地主与封建富农有五户之多。他并以私仇而乱斗乱派，引起群众对领导上极端不满。许多村子接受了这个教训，先是从组织贫雇小组，再经过较长期的斗争考验，而逐渐提拔，或由群众选举出来的真正领袖，这样的雇贫骨干，始终是与群众血肉相连的。再次，一般雇贫皆是被生活逼迫，终日劳动糊嘴，一活动就得耽误生产，因此对其生活必须适当照顾，使其安心，集中力量。如二区涧桥村赤贫，小贩最多，一天不担挑就得饿肚子，领导上必须注意解决此一问题。
