　　Jiao Wubao's War-Teaching Integration Method is Excellent
  　Zhang Maimai Became a Hero
    [Report from Taiyue, 16th of this month] Jiao Wubao, a well-known hero in Taiyue who promotes mutual assistance in killing enemies, not only can he lead new soldiers who are afraid to fight or don't know how to fight to the battlefield to fight bravely, but he has also cultivated many combat models and heroes, such as Zhang Maimai. Zhang Maimai joined the army in the first month of this year and was assigned to Jiao Wubao's mutual aid group. He was not used to the life in the army and didn't know how to fight, so he was very uneasy about his work. Jiao Wubao first helped him concretely in life and politically, often comforting him and saying, "This is our home. We will work together, eat together, and fight together in the future. If you have any difficulties, bring them up to me, and I can try to help you solve them." Jiao Wubao first taught him the performance of weapons and often led him to the training ground to learn the three major techniques, or took him to the field to practice approaching the enemy and utilizing terrain. He was able to combine the learning actions with his past combat experience to teach this war-teaching integration method, which made Zhang Maimai very interested in learning. Even though his arms were swollen from practice, he didn't feel much pain or fatigue. Once, during a field exercise, Jiao Wubao told him a combat story, saying how he used this action in the past to eliminate the enemy and capture prisoners. Zhang Maimai was happy to hear it and said, "If fighting is like this, I am sure that I won't be afraid in battle."

    The troops accepted the task of eliminating the enemy in Quwo. Before the battle, the Jiao Wubao group held a brainstorming session. He knew that Zhang Maimai was a new soldier and must be afraid, so he gave him a special explanation to make him not afraid and to keep up with the team, and told him, "Don't shoot randomly from a distance, and make good use of the terrain." He also told him some ways to avoid bullets and shells. Before the troops approached the enemy, the enemy was frantically strafing the wide river beach from the fortifications, and shouting, "Capture them alive!" "Charge!" Zhang Maimai had never experienced this kind of battle scene before and was a little scared. Jiao Wubao immediately said, "Don't be afraid, the enemy's random shooting and shouting means they are afraid of us attacking them." So Zhang Maimai gained courage. They rushed to the enemy's fortifications, and Jiao Wubao directed Zhang Maimai, Wang Zicai, and He Futu to fire flamethrowers at the enemy's fortifications. Sure enough, a row of bombs bloomed on the enemy's position. Jiao Wubao said again, "Zhang Maimai, hurry into the fortifications, they can't hit you!" They all ran into the fortifications and nothing happened to them. When the enemy saw them entering the fortifications, they were all frightened and ran away. Jiao Wubao then took Zhang Maimai to pursue the enemy. During the pursuit, Zhang obtained a gun and captured an enemy. This was Zhang Maimai's first victory in battle, and he happily said to Jiao Wubao, "Fighting the Central Army is like this."

    In the Quwo battle, Zhang Maimai performed very bravely. He was the first to rush into the courtyard in the street fighting, seized three machine guns, and captured dozens of enemies. Later, in the Nanning and Xiangling battles, he performed very well again. In this way, the new soldier Zhang Maimai learned Jiao Wubao's set of tactics and became a veteran hero who won consecutive victories.

　　焦五保战教结合办法高
  　张麦麦成了英雄
    【本报太岳十六日电】太岳著名杀敌互助英雄焦五保，他不仅是能把不敢与不会打仗的新战士带上战场英勇的去作战，而且还培养了不少的战斗模范与英雄，如张麦麦就是其中一个。张麦麦今年正月参军，编入了焦五保互助组，对部队生活不惯，不会打仗，所以对工作很不安心。焦五保便首先从生活上、政治上具体的帮助，经常安慰他说：“这就是咱的家，以后咱们要在一起工作，一起吃饭，也一起打仗，你有甚困难，给我提出来，我可以设法帮助你解决。”焦五保先教他懂得了武器的性能，经常的带领他到操场里学三大技术，或带他到野外练习接敌运动，和利用地形，并能把学习的动作和他过去的战斗经验结合起来，教这种战教结合的方式，使张麦麦学的很有兴趣，虽说把臂都练肿了，可是还不觉得很疼楚疲劳。有一次野外练习，焦五保给他讲了一个战斗故事，说他过去用这个动作怎样消灭了敌人，又怎样捉了俘虏，张麦麦听了高兴的说：“如果打仗就象这样，保险在战斗中咱也不怕。”
    部队接受了消灭曲沃敌人的任务，战前焦五保组召开了想办法会，他知道张麦麦是新战士，一定害怕，又特别给他解释，使他不要怕，跟上队，并告诉他说：“远了不敢乱打枪，地形利用好”。还告诉了些躲避子弹和躲避炮弹的办法。部队还没有接近敌人，敌人就在工事里向着广阔的河滩疯狂的扫射，还喊叫：“捉活的”，“冲呀”，张麦麦没有经过这种战斗场面，心里有些害怕，焦五保马上说：“你别怕，敌人的抢乱打，乱叫喊就是怕咱攻他。”于是张麦麦就增加了勇气。他们冲到敌人的工事跟前，焦五保指挥着张麦麦、王子财、何福图向敌人工事打火弹，果然一排子炸弹在敌人阵地轰开了花，焦五保又说：“张麦麦赶快跑进工事里去，打不着！”他们都跑进工事，就是没有一点事，敌人看见他们进了工事，都吓跑了。焦五保又带上张麦麦追击，在追击时，张得了一枝枪，俘虏了一个敌人。这第一次战斗张麦麦算是得胜了，他高兴的向焦五保说：“和中央军打仗就是这样。”
    曲沃战斗，张麦麦表现很勇敢，在巷战中第一个冲进院里，缴了三挺机枪，俘虏了几十个敌人。后来的南宁，襄陵战斗，又表现很好。就这样，新战士张麦麦学会了焦五保这一套战法，就成了连战连捷的老英雄。
