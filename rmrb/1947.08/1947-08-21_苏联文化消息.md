　　Soviet Cultural News
　　I. Fadeyev Elected General Secretary of the Writers' Union
　　The Plenary Session of the Council of the Soviet Writers' Union opened in Moscow on June 28th and closed on July 5th. More than 3,000 writers from all over the Soviet Union attended. The main agenda of the meeting was to discuss the decision of the Central Committee of the CPSU on literature. The General Assembly elected Fadeyev as the General Secretary of the Union, with Simonov, Tikhonov, Sinevsky, and Kanetchuk as his deputies, forming the Secretariat of the Union.
　　II. Zoshchenko Awakens
　　At a press conference at the Moscow Writers' Club, Shibatov announced that Zoshchenko had been expelled from the Soviet Writers' Union. Zoshchenko has recently realized his mistakes and is now writing a work dedicated to the Leningrad guerrillas. If this book is good, he will regain people's trust and re-enter the ranks of Soviet writers.
　　III. Ehrenburg's Novel "The Storm" Published
　　Ehrenburg spent two years completing his new novel "The Storm," which is 1,000 pages long. It is being serialized simultaneously in the Soviet literary magazine "New World" and a French publication. This is his longest work. The story takes place in the Soviet Union, France, the Soviet-German front, and Germany from 1939 to the spring of 1946. The characters are ordinary intellectuals from the Soviet Union, Germany, and France, and the fate of each character is integrated with the fate of their country.
　　IV. Great Soviet Encyclopedia to Be Published
　　The Great Soviet Encyclopedia, a milestone in the history of human culture and a brilliant典 (I'm not sure how to translate this, it is an archaic term) symbolizing the victory of socialism, is scheduled to be published on the 31st anniversary of the October Revolution. The content covers every department of human knowledge, each entry is written by experts, and the preparation has lasted for nearly 20 years. It is a masterpiece with correct viewpoints, extensive content, and novel materials.
　　V. All-Soviet Association for the Dissemination of Political and Scientific Knowledge Established
　　The All-Soviet Association for the Dissemination of Political and Scientific Knowledge was established on July 7th. The association has more than 2,000 basic members, including outstanding Soviet scholars, experts, artists, and military strategists, and more than 2,000 member groups. Academician Vavilov, President of the Soviet Academy of Sciences, serves as the chairman.
　　VI. Five Dictionaries Published
　　Russian-Polish, Russian-Hungarian, Russian-Turkish, Russian-Norwegian, and Russian-Serbian dictionaries will be published for the first time in the Soviet Union this year. Dictionaries of the Khilat and Ninidon languages, two ethnic groups whose languages had no written form before the Soviet revolution, will also be published for the first time this year. Famous Soviet linguists are participating in the compilation of these dictionaries.
