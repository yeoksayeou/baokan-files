Jize District Village Cadres
	Conduct Ideological Preparation for Re-examination

　　[Our reporters’ group, 26th dispatch] While leading the masses to prepare for autumn wheat planting, the Jize County Party Committee and County Government are also vigorously preparing for the re-examination this autumn and winter. Although the land reform in the county was thorough, the landlord class still hides a lot of wealth, and therefore has not bowed their heads to the masses. They are using the leadership's call for "全民生产 (all-people production)" to infiltrate mutual aid teams in large numbers, using various methods to undermine production. After joining the mutual aid teams, they often pretend to be active, asking cadres for land to cultivate, blurring the class lines of cadres and the masses, and relaxing their vigilance towards them. For some backward masses, they focus on undermining the prestige of village cadres, such as saying: "My things are guilty, and they have all been struggled against, which is right. My daughter is not guilty, but she has also been bullied by ××." For middle peasants, they spread bad influences, implying with their own "labor" today: "I am a laborer, and I have been struggled against. If you labor, it will be your turn in the future!" They show diligence to some cadres, work in the same mutual aid team, try to let the cadres take some advantage, or introduce a wife to the cadres, blocking the cadres' mouths, and then turning around to instigate and undermine behind their backs. For example, saying: "×× bullies me, ×× wants to mess with someone else's woman." The County Party Committee and the County Government constantly obtain such materials, deeply feeling that it is still far from completely eliminating feudalism, and have determined that this autumn and winter, they will make every effort to conduct a thorough re-examination. At present, the focus is on investigating relevant materials and conducting rural surveys, often using the method of "刘人私访 (Liu Ren private visits)", which is conducted secretly by several cadres, which is not easy to obtain the assistance of the broad masses, and is easy to cause suspicion and anxiety among some cadres and the masses. This year, the mass line and the class line method will be adopted, holding village branch cadre meetings, party member meetings, and village-wide mass meetings, openly stating the purpose of the investigation: "问病定脉治玻 (diagnose the disease, determine the pulse, and treat the disease)".  Hearing the opinions of party members and the masses on the degree of land reform, on the leadership, and on the cadres, and concentrating on research, in order to have a basis for adjusting the relationship between cadres and the masses after the re-examination. Select honest poor peasants in the village to form a poor peasant group as the main object of investigation and research; select two or three typical villages in each district as the focus of investigation and research. Cadres are currently undergoing study and education, with the County Party Committee studying Bo Yibo's report on land reform issues and Chen Boda's article "Have Something to Do with the Masses". District and village cadres are conducting ideological preparation for the re-examination, and gathering opinions on the leadership, in order to be presented at the county-wide cadre meeting in early next month.

　　鸡泽区村干部
  　进行复查思想酝酿
    【本报记者团二十六日电】鸡泽县委、县府领导群众准备秋种麦之余，并以大力进行今年秋冬的复查准备。该县土地改革虽彻底，但地主阶级仍隐藏内货甚多，因此尚未向群众最后低头，彼等利用领导上“全民生产”的号召，大量钻入互助组中，用各种方法破坏生产。参加互助组后，常常假装积极，向干部要求土地耕种，用糊干部群众的阶级界线，放松对他们的警惕。对于某些落后群众，着重破坏村干部的威信，如说：“我的东西有罪，都给斗出去了，这倒应该。我的闺女，并没罪，也被××欺侮。”对于中农，则散布坏影响，以自己今天的“劳动”，暗示他们：“我是劳动的人，我被斗了，你劳动，将来也到你！”对于某些干部表示殷勤，同在一个互助组作活，设法让干部占些便宜，或给干部说个老婆，堵住干部的嘴，转眼在背后挑拨破坏。如说：“××欺我，××想搞人家的女人。”县委、县府不断获得这类材料，深感距彻底消灭封建尚远，确定今年秋冬，要以全力进行一次彻底复查。在目前着重调查有关材料，进行农村调查，常采取用：“刘人私访”的方式，由几个干部秘密进行，既不易取得广大群众协助，又易在部分干部群众中造成疑虑不安。今年则采取群众路线，与阶级路线的方法，召开村支干会、党员大会及全村群众大会，公开员，说明调查的目的“问病定脉治玻　贝蚱埔陕牵?惴骸党员群众对土地改革程度、对领导及对干部的意见，集中研究，以行复查后调整干群关系的依据。在村里选择老实贫农，组成贫农小组，作为调查研究的主要对象；每区选择二、三典型村，作为调查研究的重点。在干部中正进行学习与教育，县委学习薄一波同志土地改革问题的报告，及陈伯达同志“有事和群众”一文，区村干部则进行复查的思想酝酿；并汇集对领导意见，以便在下月上旬的全县干部会中提出。（李庄）
