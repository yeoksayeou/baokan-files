Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 9th. According to a Shanghai dispatch from the Associated Press on the 6th: A prison break riot recently occurred in Suzhou Prison. One of the main reasons is that the Chiang authorities gave various special privileges and preferential treatment to several major traitors in the prison (including Chen Bijun, the wife of the traitor Wang), and other "prisoners" were subjected to their humiliation, which incited the "prisoners" to riot. The Associated Press said that the "prisoners" in the prison broke out twice on July 28th and 31st, both of which were suppressed. The leaders were arrested, and some will be escorted to Shanghai.

Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 9th. A dispatch from the Central News Agency in Nanjing on the 7th revealed that hundreds of thousands of prisoners in the entire Chiang-controlled area are living inhuman lives of hunger. The Executive Yuan of the Chiang government passed a resolution on the 7th to "improve" the treatment of prisoners: starting from May, each person will be given the equivalent of two dou and three sheng of rice per month, plus 1,000 yuan for non-staple food. Judging from the rice alone, the standard rice price is 12,000 yuan per shi. However, taking Shanghai as an example, in May, rice was already 450,000 yuan per shi. Therefore, each person can only eat three liang and one qian of rice per day, and after layers of corruption and exploitation, the actual amount obtained is even less. As for the 1,000 yuan for non-staple food, which includes coal, oil, and salt, it is even more impossible to eat any vegetables. Furthermore, the Chiang government announced that the additional budget for prisoners' food expenses from May to the end of the year is a total of 42,291,520,000 yuan. Based on this calculation, the number of "prisoners" imprisoned by the Chiang Kai-shek government must far exceed 200,000.

　　蒋党特权优待大汉奸
    激起苏州监狱暴动
    【新华社陕北九日电】据合众社六日沪讯：苏州监狱近发生“犯人”破狱暴动，其主要原因之一，系由于蒋当局对狱中若干大汉奸（其中包括汪逆之妻陈璧君）给予种种特权优待，其他“犯人”备受彼等凌辱，由此激起“犯人”暴动。合众社称，该监狱“犯人”，于上月二十八日以及三十一日两次破狱均遭镇压，为首者被捕，一部将被解押上海。
    【新华社陕北九日电】据中央社南京七日电泄露，全蒋官区被监禁犯人数十万人，过着非人的饥饿生活。蒋政府行政院七日通过“改善”监犯待遇为：自五月起，每人每月给二斗三升米代金，另给一千元副食费，单以食米一项来看，所发米价标准为每石一万二千元，但以上海为例，在五月间，米每石已为四十五万元，故每人每天只能吃到三两一钱米，再加上层层贪污剥削，实得当更少。至于一千元的副食费，包括煤、油、盐等，则更吃不到什么菜。又：蒋政府宣布囚犯伙食费自五月至年底之追加预算总数为四百二十二亿九千一百五十二万元，据此推算，则被蒋介石政府监禁的“囚犯”人数，当远超过二十万人。
