　　Da Chi Strives for a Bumper Harvest Next Summer:
  　Buying More Oxen to Plow Wheat Fields Three Times
    [Our dispatch] In Xiangyuan's Fourth District, Da Chi Village is planning increased production in night school. The wheat fields will be plowed three times in preparation for a larger wheat harvest next year. Anfu said first, "We plan to plow the wheat fields three times, but our village is short of livestock and doesn't have enough! Before the War of Resistance, our village had fifty or so oxen, an average of one per household; now our village only has twenty-five oxen, half as many. How can we cultivate the land well?" Old Man Baotang said, "It's impossible without livestock. Buying an ox requires a lot of grain. Now it's hard to buy one even with two dou of black beans a day." Old Man Fu Zhi said, "I have a suggestion. Isn't our village now sharing one ox between an average of three or four families? We can combine into two families feeding one ox. Everyone tighten their belts, and with more people, more strength. We can also absorb some households in our village that don't have livestock, and it won't be a problem to increase a few oxen." After he made this suggestion, everyone discussed and considered it. Wu Laigui said, "I'm not just buying an ox for immediate needs. I'm planning for the long term. The day before yesterday, I bought an ox for 90,000 yuan in the vegetable market. Now I'm harvesting nine shi of wheat. I'll only keep some for seeds and buy oxen with the rest. You can't farm without livestock." Duan Youcai also bought an ox. Later, everyone unanimously agreed that buying oxen was essential, and they did so through mutual aid teams, with two or three families combining to own one ox. Within five days, Da Chi natural village added seven oxen. Yan Demin bought a large ox by himself and is actively preparing to deeply plow the wheat fields, at least three times, to strive for a larger wheat harvest next year. Nan'e Village, Zhao Family Hamlet, in the First District, held a middle peasant meeting on July 30 to discuss the issue of plowing wheat fields. Lu Chengquan said, "Today, fourteen families are at the meeting, cultivating more than 520 mu of land, but only feeding three livestock. That's not good. Last year, the wheat fields weren't plowed well, and this summer, each mu yielded two dou less wheat. When planting in the spring, we rushed to sow because we had to prepare for the war, but the livestock wasn't good, the land wasn't cultivated enough, and it was dry. Many fields didn't sprout after planting. The quality of livestock is really important for growing crops!" Zhao Baowu said, "What you said is right! Anyone can do the math. Today, I'll tell you the truth! I also want to buy good livestock, but I'm afraid of struggle when I'm idle in the winter, so I dare not buy it." Wang Fengyi said, "We've suffered a lifetime of hardship with these few mu of land. Are we still afraid of struggle now?" At this time, the Farmers' Association chairman immediately talked about the return of wrongly confiscated fruit to Feng Zeng＠Wen, and everyone's thinking became clear that middle peasants who build their homes through labor are not afraid of struggle. Lu Chengquan then said, "If that's the case, the small donkey that my two families share is really not strong enough. I want to buy a mule to replace it." Zhao Quanxing also said, "Given the situation, it's okay for my family to buy a head of livestock alone." Under their influence, fourteen families bought a total of five livestock. Since resolving their fear of struggle, the middle peasants' enthusiasm for production is now several times higher than before. They all say, "We must work hard and make sure our families have enough to eat and wear!" (Increased Production and Disaster Relief Small Newspaper)

　　大池争取明夏多收
  　添买耕牛三犁麦地
    【本报讯】襄垣四区大池，为了增产，在夜校进行计划，麦地要耕三次，准备明年多收麦子。安福首先说：“咱们计划麦地要耕三次，可是现在咱村牲口缺乏，不够用呀！抗战前咱村有五十来个牛，每户平均一个；现在咱村只有廿五头牛，就短了一半，如何能种好地？”保堂老汉说：“没牲口就无法办，买牛晌可厉害，现在一天出二斗黑豆还买不到。”富支老汉说：“我看我提个意见吧，咱村现在不是平均三、四家就伙养一个牛吗？可合并成二家伙喂一个牛，大家都打个饥荒，人多力量大，再把咱村没牲口户也吸收上些，增加几只牛是不成问题。”他的意见提出后，大家接着就讨论酝酿，武来贵说：“我不买牛晌，我要为长期打算，我前天在菜街九万元买了个牛，我现在打下九石麦子，我只留下些做籽的，都买了牛，种地没牲口还能行。”段有才现下也买下牛，后来大家一致认为买牛是必须，并以互助组进行，两三家合并一只牛。在五天内大池自然村增加了七头牛，阎德民独买了一个大牛，积极准备深麦地，至少深耕三遍，争取明年多打麦子。一区南娥属赵家烟村在七月三十日召开中农会议，商量耕麦地问题。路成全说：“今天在会十四家，种有五百二十多亩地，才喂有三个牲口，还不好，去年麦地没垡好，今夏每亩少收了二斗多麦。春耕下种时，因为要准备参战，就突击下种，可是牲口不好，地没闹成熟，天又旱，好多地种上没出来苗，种庄稼牲口好坏可有关系哩。”赵保五说：“你说这话真对！谁也会算帐，今天我给你说老实话吧！我亦想买个好牲口，就是怕冬天闲了斗争，所以不敢买。”王凤义说：“咱这几家跟上这几亩地受了一辈子苦，现在还怕斗争咱？”这时农会主席即拿上丰曾＠文被斗错退回果实事谈了一遍，大家思想上才明确了劳动起家的中农不怕斗争。路成全就说：“要是这样的话，我两家一个小驴实在不顶硬，要买一个骡子使换。”赵全兴也说：“照这样情况，我一家独买一头牲口也行。”在他二人影响下，十四家共买牲口五头。自解决怕斗思想后，现在中农生产劲头比先高了数倍，都说：“咱可得好好动弹，把家闹得有吃有穿哩！”（增产渡荒小报）
