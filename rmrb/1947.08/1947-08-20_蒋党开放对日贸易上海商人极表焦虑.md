　　Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 18th: According to a Reuters dispatch from Shanghai on the 15th, all Shanghai Chinese business figures contacted by their reporter expressed extreme anxiety regarding the Chiang government's decision to resume trade with Japan. They believe that opening foreign trade to Japan is the first step in Japan's resurgence, and Japan's resurgence will ultimately threaten Chinese industry, and they deeply believe that the country will be flooded with cheap Japanese goods. They said that the influx of large quantities of Japanese goods will definitely deal a severe blow to Chinese industry, especially the cotton textile, glass, and porcelain industries. They fear that trade with Japan will be "one-sided," because Chinese exports will be "very limited" for a long time.

　　蒋党开放对日贸易上海商人极表焦虑
    【新华社陕北十八日电】据露透社上海十五日消息：该社记者所接触的一切上海中国商界人士对蒋政府决定恢复对日贸易一举，均表示极大焦虑。他们认为开放日本对外贸易是日本复兴的第一步，日本的复兴将最终威胁中国工业，并深信全国将廉价日货所泛滥。他们说，大批日货的涌入定将予中国工业以严重打击，特别是棉织，玻璃与瓷器三项工业。他们惧怕对日贸易将是“单方面”的，因为中国出口在很长一个时间内将是“很有限”的。
