　　Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 26th. General news: Chiang Kai-shek, after issuing the reactionary "General Mobilization Order" and in order to make up for the massive loss of troops in his civil war, is frantically carrying out a nationwide conscription plan, which is now being resisted by people everywhere. According to a Central News Agency report, Xu Siping, head of Chiang's military service bureau, publicly admitted at a tea party in Shanghai on the 17th of last month that the Chiang government's "future difficulties and current crisis are more serious than during the War of Resistance." Xu Siping has been restless recently, flying around everywhere, busy arranging the grabbing of men. It is reported that Chiang Kai-shek plans to conscript one million soldiers within the year. However, the people in the KMT-controlled areas refuse to be cannon fodder for the traitors and have adopted various methods to resist this reactionary measure of forcing the people to give up their lives. According to a report in the Tianjin Shih Pao on the 22nd of last month: "According to unofficial statistics from the Civil Affairs Office, the number of young men of conscription age in Tianjin who have applied to be conscripted is almost equal to the number of men of conscription age." According to a United Press report from Shanghai: "The Shanghai Civil Affairs Bureau announced on the 19th that 80 percent of eligible young people in the city have requested exemption from military service." As for those who have been forcibly conscripted, they are unwilling to be Chiang Kai-shek's cannon fodder in the civil war and are fleeing in large numbers. According to Associated Press and TASS reports from Shanghai on the 13th, in the middle of last month, "new recruits grabbed from various parts of Zhejiang were transferred to the North China war zone in a steady stream, and many escaped when passing through Shanghai." According to Shanghai newspapers, in late last month, new recruits conscripted from eastern Hubei escaped while being transported to Shanghai for training, with sixteen people risking their lives to jump off the train in one instance to avoid military service. In areas along the lower reaches of the Yangtze River, mass escapes of new KMT soldiers are heard of daily. Although the Chiang government has used various methods to encourage service and prevent escape, such as painting huge slogans like "Good men do not avoid military service" and "Good men do not run away" on walls in major cities such as Yangzhou, Xu Siping and the heads of various units of the bureau's logistics headquarters have also personally gone to Shanghai, Nanjing Xiaguan and other places to conduct new "comfort" activities, all of which have been ineffective. Chiang sent a part of the Nanjing garrison to Chongming Island to carry out armed conscription, but the island's residents still risked crossing the Yangtze River to escape into the liberated areas of northern Jiangsu. After encountering difficulties everywhere in "conscription," the government also partially changed to recruiting "volunteer soldiers." For example, it has openly bought men in Beijing, Shanghai, Tianjin, and other places. The official price in Nanjing is 2.55 million yuan per person, 3 million yuan in Tangshan, and the black market price for strong men in Shanghai has reached as high as 5 million yuan, but very few are willing to sell their lives for Chiang Kai-shek. In view of the difficulties in "grabbing" and "recruiting," the Chiang clique's Guizhou local authorities have forced prisoners to serve as new soldiers. In mid-July, more than 400 prisoners from the Bijie District Court in the province were driven into military service. Qingdao has adopted the method of forcing students exiled in Qingdao to become soldiers, claiming that it will "mobilize" one-fifth of the students in Qingdao to supplement the "Youth Army." Chiang's government's conscription is encountering many difficulties, and Wei Demai is also very anxious. When Wei participated in the Chiang family's petty court state affairs meeting, he "instructed" Chiang Kai-shek: "The sons of wealthy people, officers, and government officials should also be included in the conscription plan."

　　蒋贼征兵计划遭各地人民反抗
  　兵源枯竭抓买无效
    【新华社陕北廿六日电】综合消息：蒋介石颁布反动的“总动员令”后，为弥补其内战兵员大量耗损疯狂进行之全国性大征兵计划，刻已遭受各地人民的反抗。据中央社消息，蒋家兵役局长徐思平上月十七日在上海招待各界茶会上，公开承认蒋政府“来日大难与现在危机较抗战时更为严重”。徐思平近来坐卧不安，到处乱飞，忙于布置抓丁。据悉蒋介石计划年内要征兵一百万人。但是，蒋管区人民拒绝为卖国贼当炮灰，已采取各种办法反抗此种向人民逼命的反动措施。据上月二十二日天津世报报导：“天津市及龄壮丁申请办理征召者，据民政处非正式统计，已几与及龄男子数相等。”另据合众社沪电：“上海民政处于十九日宣称：该市百分之八十的适龄青年请求免服兵役。”至于已被强征入伍者，亦均不愿为蒋介石当内战炮灰而纷纷逃亡。据美联社及塔斯社上海十三日电，上月中“自浙江各地所抓新兵源源转运华北战区，当路经上海时，逃走甚多。”据上海报载，上月下旬，鄂东被征新兵运往上海受训途中，一次即有十六人冒死跳车逃避服役。在长江下游各地，蒋军新兵大批逃走日有所闻，蒋政府虽曾以各种办法鼓励服役及防止逃亡，如在杨州等各地大城市墙上大画什么“好男儿不避兵役”，“好男儿不逃走”等巨幅标语。徐思平及该局后勤总部各单位主官亦曾亲赴上海、南京下关各地进行新“慰劳”，亦均无效。蒋派南京驻军一部至崇明岛实行武装抓丁，岛上居民仍冒险抢渡长江逃入苏北解放区。在“征兵”到处遭受困难之后，亦曾部分改行招募“志兵愿”办法，如在京、沪、平、津各地均已公开买丁，南京官价为每名二百五十五万元，唐山为三百万元，上海壮丁黑市已高达五百万元，但愿为蒋介石卖命者，仍寥寥无几。蒋记贵州地方当局鉴于“抓”与“募”之困难，曾强迫监狱犯人充当新兵，七月中该省毕节地方法院犯人四百余人即被驱充兵役。青岛且已采行逼使流亡青岛学生当兵办法，声言将“动员”青市学生五分之一补入“青年军”。蒋政府征兵遭遇重重困难，魏德迈亦甚为着急。魏在参与蒋家小朝廷国务会议时，曾“训示”蒋介石：“富翁、军官及政府官员子弟，亦应列入征兵计划中。”
