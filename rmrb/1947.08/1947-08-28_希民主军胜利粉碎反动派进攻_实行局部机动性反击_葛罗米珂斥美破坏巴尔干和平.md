　　Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, August 21st: Athens dispatch: The Greek Democratic Army has not only victoriously smashed the offensive of the traitorous Greek government army, but has also implemented localized mobile counterattacks. According to a public communique from the Democratic Army headquarters: on the 18th, the Democratic Army launched an offensive against the enemy at Faga and Xifuzi in the West Macedonia region, and after two hours of combat, killed 105 enemy soldiers and captured 106, while the Democratic Army suffered only 16 casualties. Furthermore, according to the Greek government, the Democratic Army has grown to 50,000 troops. Amidst the growing strength of the Democratic Army, the Greek reactionary government is extremely panicked. On the one hand, it claims that the Democratic Army has received "foreign aid" and that the Greek issue has become an "international problem." On the other hand, it is demanding that its master, the United States, directly send troops to intervene. According to the Chicago Sun, the U.S. Cabinet Committee has studied the possibility of sending troops to Greece in detail and has designated the Department of the Army to study the relevant details. At the same time, the United States is currently recruiting "volunteer teams" composed of Nazi elements and Quisling elements in Germany (U.S. occupied zone), Italy, Belgium, and other countries, preparing to send them to Greece to fight against the Democratic Army.
　　Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, August 21st: New York dispatch: The Worker Daily newspaper published an article opposing the use of force by the United States in Greece to support the feudal fascist regime. The newspaper condemned the statement of the U.S. representative to the Security Council, Johnson, as "arrogant and shameless." The newspaper also stated: "We have the United Nations organization, and the American people do not want to go beyond the United Nations." The afternoon newspaper sharply criticized Johnson's statement, saying: "The basic mistake of the United States lies in unilaterally aiding Greece," and denounced "the adventurous attempt of the United States to get involved in the Greek civil war."
　　Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, August 21st: Comprehensive report: The United States is attempting to interfere in the internal affairs of Yugoslavia, Bulgaria, and Albania in the Security Council by exploiting the "Greek border dispute incident." Since July 29th, when the Soviet Union used its veto power in the Security Council against the U.S. proposal to "establish a semi-permanent committee to monitor and investigate the border disputes between Greece and Yugoslavia, Bulgaria, and Albania," the United States has instigated Greece to once again falsely accuse Yugoslavia, Bulgaria, and Albania of "threatening peace" in the Security Council on July 31st. On August 7th, under the active manipulation of the United States, the Security Council organized a seven-member subcommittee to formulate a so-called "compromise plan." In the Security Council on the 12th, the U.S. representative Johnson threatened the Soviet Union, saying: "If the Security Council does not resolve this issue according to the U.S. opinion due to the Soviet Union's use of veto power, the United States will take other 'collective actions' outside the meeting with other countries." The Soviet representative Gromyko thoroughly exposed the collusion between the United States and Greece in the meetings on the 6th, 12th, and 14th, and pointed out that these actions by the United States truly undermined the peace of the Balkans. He strongly argued that the so-called "Greek border incident" dispute was entirely due to the behind-the-scenes instigation of the United States. The Soviet Union proposed that to truly resolve this issue, the following must be done: First, all foreign troops and military personnel must be withdrawn from Greece. Second, a special committee of the Security Council should be established to ensure that foreign "aid" is only used for the benefit of the Greek people and not to help the reactionary government to wage a civil war. Third, the Greek government should be seriously advised to democratize. The legitimate suggestions of the Soviet Union were rejected by the United States and other countries, and the issue is still under debate.

    葛罗米珂斥美破坏巴尔干和平
    【新华社陕北二十一日电】雅典讯：希腊民主军不但胜利地粉碎希腊卖国政府军的进攻，而且机动地实行局部性的反击。据民主军总部广播公报称：民主军十八日在西马其顿区向法加与希佛兹之敌发动进攻，经两小时战斗，毙敌一○五人。俘敌一○六人，民主军仅伤十六人。另据希腊政府声称，民主军已发展至五万人。在民主声势日益壮大之下，希反动政府恐慌异常，一面扬言民主军获有“外国援助”，希腊问题已成“国际问题”，一面要求其主子美国直接出兵干涉。据芝加哥太阳报称：美内阁委员会已详细研究了派兵赴希腊的可能性，并已指定陆军部研究有关细节。同时，美国刻正在德（美占领区）、意、比等国招募由纳粹分子、吉斯林分子组成之“志愿队”，准备开至希腊对民主军作战。
    【新华社陕北二十一日电】纽约讯：美工人日报著论反对美国在希腊使用武力支持封建法西斯政权。该报斥美国安理会代表詹生之声明为“骄横、无耻”。该报并称：“我们有了联合国组织，美国人民不希望越过联合国”。下午报尖锐批评詹生的声明称：“美国基本错误在于片面援助希腊。”并斥责“美国卷入希腊内战之冒险企图”。
    【新华社陕北二十一日电】综合报导：美国在安理会中利用“希腊边境纠纷事件”，妄图干涉南、保、阿内政。自上月二十九日，苏联在安理会中，对美国提议“成立一个半永久性的委员会，以监视和调查希腊与南、保、阿三国之边境纠纷”一案，使用否决权后，美国又唆使希腊于上月三十一日再度向安理会诬控南、保、阿三国“威胁和平”。八月七日，安理会又在美极积操纵下组织一个七人小组委员会，以拟定所谓“折衷方案”。在十二日安理会中，美代表詹森恫吓苏联说：“如果安理会因苏联使用否决权而不按照美国意见解决此一问题，美国就要与其他国家在会外采取其他‘集体行动’。”苏代表葛罗米珂即在六日、十二日、十四日的会议中，对美、希勾结之阴谋予以彻底揭露，并指出美国这些行动真正的破坏了巴尔干的和平。他力称所谓“希腊边境事件”的纠纷，完全由于美国幕后的挑拨。苏联提议要真正解决此一问题，必须：第一、从希腊撤退一切外国军队和军事人员。第二、设立安理会特别委员会，以保证外国“援助”只用在有益于希腊人民而非帮助反动政府去内战。第三、应当严正的劝告希腊政府，使希腊政府民主化。苏联的正当建议，竟为美国等国所拒绝，目前该问题仍在辩论中。
