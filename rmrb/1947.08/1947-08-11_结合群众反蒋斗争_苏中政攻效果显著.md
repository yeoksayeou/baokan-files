Xinhua News Agency, Central China, 9th -- In Subei, the political offensive following Chiang Kai-shek's forces, combined with various anti-Chiang struggles by the masses, has produced many vivid events and achieved great results: 1. Combining with anti-tax struggles – for example, in a village north of the (Gao)ju (Gang) line, reactionary landlord Ge Yongzhong led more than forty Chiang supporters from the village to extort taxes. The village cadres immediately mobilized the masses, stating, "The 'Homecoming Legion' must be dissolved to thoroughly end tax extortion." They then organized an iron fork brigade of over a hundred people to parade with torches at night, issuing warnings to Ge: (1) Return early and you'll be guaranteed safety; don't return and we guarantee you'll be caught. (2) Take fourteen people, you must return with fourteen people. (3) Touch a hair on our heads, and we'll strip you bare." Under the power of the masses, all fourteen Chiang supporters from the village were sent back by Ge within three days. Subsequently, at a meeting of Chiang supporters in the whole village, they were made to report on the Chiang army's defeats, explaining that supporting Chiang led to no good end. On the spot, four Chiang supporters cried bitterly and ran to the strongholds to drag their conscripted relatives home. Within ten days, all forty-plus Chiang supporters in the village were disintegrated and returned home. 2. Combining with anti-construction of fortifications – In a certain border village near the Libao stronghold, over a thousand people were forced by the Chiang army to build fortifications every day. Village cadres, after learning from the captured masses that most Chiang soldiers were new recruits who cried at the mention of home, convened a mass meeting in the village to discuss methods of resisting the construction of fortifications. They decided to have the captured masses throw "Chiang Army Cease-War and Return Home Passes" and various leaflets into the Chiang army's trenches, and to explain questions to the Chiang soldiers at any time. Soon, fifty-four Chiang soldiers ceased fighting and deserted. 3. Combining with anti-rape – In a certain village in Rudong, a women's self-protection group won over six Chiang soldiers in one day. When Chiang soldiers surrounded the village looking for women, the women's self-protection group gathered and persuaded one Chiang soldier. Soon, six Chiang soldiers gathered, all moved to tears. The women seized the opportunity to persuade them to desert. In × District alone, the women's self-protection group motivated over forty people to desert. 4. Combining with anti-conscription – After Wu Yiyuan and two others from a village in Rudong were conscripted, they befriended new recruits in the 3rd Battalion of the × Regiment under the Chiang 49th Division, who had just been drawn from Anhui. Within six days, they secretly organized thirty-two people to escape, influencing two hundred and eighty people in the unit to desert one after another. (Meng Huai)

　　结合群众反蒋斗争
  　苏中政攻效果显著
    【新华社华中九日电】苏中蒋后政治攻势与群众各种反蒋斗争相结合，出现许多生动事迹，收效甚大：一、和反捐税结合——如（皋）掘（港）线北侧某乡反动地主葛永忠带领该乡四十余名附蒋分子在某村勒索捐税，该乡干部即向该村群众动员“还乡团解体，反捐税才能彻底”，当组织铁叉队百余人于晚间打着火把游行示威，对葛提出警告：（一）早回来保证没事，不回来保证捉到。（二）带十四人去也要带十四人回。（三）动我们一根毛，我们弄你周身没毛。在群众威力下，三天后该村十四个附蒋分子全部由葛送回。接着就在全乡蒋属会议上由彼等报告蒋军失利情况，说明附蒋没下场，当场有四个蒋属痛哭流涕跑到据点去拖夫拉子，十天中该乡四十多附蒋分子即全部被瓦解回家。二、和反筑工事结合——李堡据点某边乡每天有千余群众被蒋军拉去筑工事，乡干部经过被抓群众了解了蒋军多系新兵，提起家就哭，即召开全乡群众会议，商讨反筑工事办法，并决定通过被抓群众将“蒋军罢战还乡通行证”及各种传单向蒋军城壕里丢发，对蒋军士兵提出疑问随时解释，不久即有五十四名蒋军罢战逃走。三、和反奸污结合——如东某乡一个妇女保身组一天争取了六个蒋军。当蒋军包围该乡寻找妇女时，该妇女保身组即集结劝说一个蒋军，移时蒋军聚至六人，均被感动痛哭，妇女乘机劝他们开小差。仅×区经妇女保身组动员开小差者即达四十余人。四、和反抓丁结合——如东某村吴以元等三人被抓后，即在蒋四十九师所属×团三营和刚由安徽抽来之壮丁交朋友，六天中秘密组织了三十二人逃出，影响该部陆续开小差者达二百八十人。　（孟淮）
