(Special Dispatch) Taiyuan under Yan's regime has been desperately seizing laborers to build fortifications in recent months, attempting to prolong its "old and failing" existence. It has divided the area around Taiyuan into five military districts: Taiyuan as the central district, Huangzhai as the northern district, Shitian'an as the western district, Hanshan as the eastern district, and the Yuci area as the southern district. In addition to the existing 300 ordinary bunkers and 10 artillery and large bunkers each, it has newly built over 540 "life bunkers." It also plans to scrape together ten divisions of troops in an attempt to resist the liberation forces' advance on Taiyuan, like a mantis trying to stop a chariot. Yan's regime has put forward the slogan "Cadres trained a hundred times, elite soldiers tempered a hundred times," and established two trusted regiments: one in Wanbailin Village, with more than 3,000 people, responsible for training by the big secret agents Meng Jifeng and Yang Zhenji; the other is run by the Japanese, and in three months, a Japanese-equipped division will be established. But the result of all the commotion is that even his trusted high-ranking officials have no confidence in this kind of training. Yang Zhenji can't even "train" his own son, saying, "I don't care about you, as long as you don't run away!" Talking about defending Taiyuan, the Yan regime's military law office told his son, "Taiyuan will definitely not be defended, and we won't be able to survive at that time. You should run to the west of the city and hide in the house of relatives in × village to preserve our family line!" When ordinary high-ranking officials of Yan's regime talk about the current situation, their faces suddenly change, either saying "Danger, danger," or saying "Waiting to die!" filled with fear and despair.

　　太原阎伪惊恐不安
    大修“生命碉”图延残喘高级官员充满绝望情绪
    【本报特讯】太原阎伪近月以来，拚命抓夫修筑工事，企图延续“老而不死”的暮年。并将太原周围划为五个军区：太原为中区，黄寨为北区，石天岸为西区，汉山为东区，榆次一带为南区；除原有普通碉三百座，大炮碉、大阔碉各十座外，又新建“生命碉”，共计五百四十余座。并再计划拚凑十个师的兵力，企图螳臂挡车防卫太原。阎伪提出“百训的干部，百练的精兵”口号，成立两个亲信团：一个在万百林村，共三千余人，由大特务孟际丰、杨贞吉负责训练；另一个由日人主持，三个月后，成立日械化师团。但闹腾的结果，即他的亲信高级官员对于这种训练也都没有信心。杨贞吉连他儿子也“训”不过来，说“我不管你了，只要你不跑行！”谈到防卫太原，阎记军法处对他儿子说：“太原一定不保，至时我们活不了，你要往西城跑，到×村亲戚家藏起来，为咱家留个种儿！”一般阎记高级官员一谈到时局，颜色就忽然变了，不是说“危险危险”，就是说“等着死吧！”充满着恐惧绝望情绪。
