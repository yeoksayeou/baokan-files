    Zhangtou Every Household Holds Meetings to Resolve Knots @
    Family Harmony is of One Mind,
    Production and Disaster Preparedness Have Strength
    [Our newspaper Changzhi News] Zhangtou Village, in the First District, has adopted a mass line leadership method, promoting the village's production, frugality, and disaster preparedness movement. The entire village, with over two hundred households and over a thousand people, has formulated plans for exchanging rice for mixed chaff and vegetables. Each person saves about three he (合) per day, saving approximately over five thousand jin (斤) of rice and over three thousand jin (斤) of corn per month. In terms of production, in the first hundred days of spinning and weaving, each woman earned an average of sixteen jin and four liang (两) of cotton. Everyone proposed another "sixteen jin" movement. In addition, over 1,700 mu (亩) of land has been hoed twice, 120 mu have been replanted, 630 mu of wheat stubble have been plowed, and over 2,000 jin of wild vegetables have been dug. The main experience in achieving these results is: First, inspiring typical households who suffered during famine years to complain and take the lead, launching a disaster prevention and suffering complaint campaign, and adopting a self-education method of solving knots @ themselves. Farmer Association member Tian Yuan said: "During famine years, even bran could not be bought. Sometimes, we bought bran mixed with soil. We ate bran and drank bitter vegetable soup. Seeing others eating bran knots @, we felt it was really fragrant." He shed tears of pain as he spoke. Old man Huang Jinkui spoke of selling his four-year-old child to others to be beaten and scolded because there was nothing to eat during the famine year, crying with tears streaming down his face. After complaining, most people shed tears. At this time, it was immediately proposed: "Only by working hard can we overcome the heavens; eating vegetables and bran to prevent disaster is also to defeat Old Chiang." However, during the process, it was discovered that many families were having disagreements, with each person having their own ideas and unable to work together. After discovering this problem, after everyone discussed it, it was realized that to do well, it was necessary to go deep into the households to resolve knots @. Immediately, slogans such as "Every household holds meetings to resolve knots @, and works together to become prosperous" and "The whole family is of one mind to prepare for disaster, and actively produces surplus grain" were proposed. For example, Guo Sanze and his son Gui Suo could not get along. Their fields were not together, and they never spoke at home. At the meeting, Guo Sanze said: "My son does not obey my command, and the family cannot be good." Gui Suo said: "I am over twenty years old this year. When my father opens his mouth, he scolds, and when he raises his hand, he hits. I have no place to put my face." The second daughter-in-law said: "I cannot support the pot in our family. If I cook a lot, there is not enough to eat, and if I cook less, it is not enough. My brother scolds me for saving for the landlords." After discussion, everyone said: If you save, others cannot take it away, and if there is nothing to eat, you should suffer yourself. If the family wants to be good, everyone must work together. Guo Sanze said: "I have a bad temper, and I promise to change it in the future. We will discuss everything if something happens." Gui Suo said: "Dad! In the future, don't scold or beat me in front of others. I will listen to you about everything." The second daughter-in-law said: "If we don't cook enough in the future, we should speak up, not hit people with words." After resolving the knots @, when formulating a savings plan, Guo Sanze said with a smile: "Women, let's talk about how to be thrifty first?" The eldest daughter-in-law, Xiuying, said: "Originally, we ate thick porridge in the morning, which required two sheng (升) of rice. If we change to eating knots @ mixed with bran, we can save half a sheng of rice; don't eat boiled rice at noon, change to Hezi rice, mixed with vegetables can save half a sheng of rice, after weeding, eat thin porridge, what do you think?" Everyone said "Agreed." The second daughter-in-law said: "I think we eat too many river noodles a dozen times a month, changing it to once every ten days will save a lot too." This was also approved by everyone. When formulating a production plan, Guo Sanze proposed that in addition to farming, he would transport two trips to Henan Dian. The second daughter-in-law said: "In addition to taking care of the children, I will spin four jin of cotton and make eight pairs of shoe soles before autumn." The eldest daughter-in-law will spin two jin of cotton and make fifteen pairs of shoe soles. Gui Suo's mother will spin five jin of cotton in addition to cooking, and Gui Suo's mother was selected to be responsible for inside the house, and his father was responsible for outside. After formulating the plan, the whole family was very motivated.
    In the village, in family meetings, all sought the help of cadres to solve knots @. After resolving the knots @, men encouraged women, women praised men, and adults rewarded children, all were beaming with joy. For example, Bao Yu said that his woman was good at managing the household and was very frugal. The woman also politely said: "It's not just that I'm good, we are both good, right?" Now the village's atmosphere is brand new, and everyone is full of confidence in overcoming disaster and becoming prosperous through production. (Yang Qianwei)

    嶂头户户开会解圪＠
    家庭和睦一条心
    生产备荒才有劲
    【本报长治讯】一区嶂头村，采取群众路线的领导方法，推动了全村的生产节约备荒运动。全村二百余户一千余口人，家家订出换饭掺糠菜计划，每人每日省三合，每月约省米五千余斤、玉茭三千余斤。生产方面，第一个百日纺织，每个妇女平均赚花十六斤四两，大家提出再来个“十六斤”运动。另外一千七百余亩锄过二遍，补种一百二十亩，犁麦茬六百三十亩，挖野菜两千余斤。取得这些成绩的主要经验是：首先启发灾荒年受过苦的典型户诉苦带头，展开防灾荒诉痛苦，采取了自己圪＠自己解的自教办法。农会天元说：“灾荒年就连糠也买不到，有时连糠带土买上些，吃的是糠，喝的是苦菜汤，见别人吃的糠圪＠，觉的实在香。”谈到这痛心的眼泪直流。黄金奎老汉谈到灾荒年没吃的，把四岁的小孩卖给人家受打受骂时，哭的一把一泪。经过诉苦大半人都下了泪。这时马上提出：“只有好好干，一定能战胜天；吃菜吃糠防备灾荒，也是为了打败老蒋。”但在进行中，发现有许多家闹蹩扭，一人一个心闹不到一块儿，发现这个问题后，经大家讨论，要想做的好，非深入到户解圪＠不行，当即提出“户户开会解圪＠，齐心合力闹发家”，“全家一心来备荒，积极生产有余粮”等口号。如郭三则与他儿贵锁搞不来，去地不在一块，回家永不说话，开会时郭三则提出：“我儿不服指挥，家就闹不好”贵锁说：“我今年廿多岁的人啦，我爹一开口就是骂抬手就是打，我这脸就没搁处”，二媳妇提出：“我在咱家撑不了锅，做多吃不了，做少不够吃，俺哥骂我是省下当老财哩。”经过讨论，大家都说：省下别人拿不了，没吃的自己该受罪，家里要想好大家一心闹。郭三则说：“我这脾气大，保证以后要改，咱有了事大家商量。”贵锁说：“爹！以后你不要对着人骂我打我了。甚事我也要听你说。”二媳妇说：“咱以后做的不够吃了，要言语，不要话头打人才好。”解开圪＠后，订节约计划时，郭三则笑着说：“女人们先说怎样俭省吧？”大媳妇秀英说：“原来咱清早吃的是稠饭得二升米，以后改吃圪＠掺上糠，就能省半升米；晌午不要吃捞饭，改成和子饭，掺上菜能省半升米，过了锄苗吃稀的，你们说行不行。”大家都说“同意”。二媳妇说：“我觉的咱一月吃十来顿河捞太多，改成十天一顿也省好多哩。”也经大家通过。订生产计划时，郭三则提出，除种地外，要下河南店运输两趟。二媳妇说：“我除看小孩外，秋前纺四斤花，纳八双鞋底。”大媳妇是纺花二斤，纳十五双鞋底。贵锁娘除做饭外，要纺花五斤，并选出家内由贵锁娘负责，外边他爹负责。订计划后全家劲头很高。
    全村在家庭会议中，都找干部帮助解决圪＠，经过解圪＠，男人鼓励女人，女人表扬男人，大人奖励小孩，都喜气洋洋。如保玉说他女人会过人家，很俭省，女人还客气的说：“这不是光我好，咱是两好并一好吧。”现在村上风气焕然一新，大家充满战胜灾荒生产发家的信心。（杨谦维）
