Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 22nd -- Shanghai News: Under American pressure, Britain signed an "Anti-Smuggling" agreement with the Chiang representatives at the Hong Kong Governor's Office on the 15th. From then on, American forces can directly enter Hong Kong, the commercial gateway and important strategic base of South China. The agreement was signed by the General Superintendent of Customs of the Chiang Kai-shek Finance Ministry's Taxation Department and the British Hong Kong government. According to the agreement, the Chiang Kai-shek customs organization, which was originally controlled by American personnel and headed by the American Lidu as the General Superintendent of Customs, can now directly carry out "anti-smuggling" duties in Hong Kong, establish checkpoints, and strengthen the Americanized Chiang Kai-shek "anti-smuggling" fleet entering and leaving Hong Kong waters. In order to seize absolute control of the South China market, the United States has actively instigated the Chiang side to clamor for the recovery of Hong Kong, so that the United States can actually occupy this strategic base. This conspiracy has not yet been realized. The United States and Chiang Kai-shek then made a big fuss about the "anti-smuggling" issue. Under the active proposal of the United States, the United States and Chiang Kai-shek signed the so-called "Agreement on the Exchange of Intelligence on the Suppression of Opium and Drugs Smuggling" on May 23, further establishing the status of the United States in China's "anti-smuggling" administration. Since then, the Hong Kong "smuggling" issue has been loudly clamored for. The Kuomintang Ministry of Foreign Affairs has repeatedly requested the British Foreign Office and the Hong Kong government to establish an "effective anti-smuggling agreement," but the British side has ignored it. After Wedemeyer arrived in China, he put pressure on Hong Kong again, but the British side still insisted that "a large part of the smuggling is with the acquiescence of the Chinese government (referring to the Chiang government) and land and sea personnel," indicating that "the key to anti-smuggling is not in Hong Kong." On August 12, Sun Ke was ordered to go to Hong Kong to meet the British Governor. Wedemeyer also began his trip to South China. Finally, the "anti-smuggling" agreement was signed on the 15th.

Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 22nd -- Tokyo News: Power, the representative of the British Dominion on the Allied Council for Japan and head of the Australian Liaison Mission in Japan, expressed his dissatisfaction with MacArthur's control of Japan. He drew attention to the fact that the Japanese government had not fulfilled the Allied policy of democratizing Japan; and believed that: to prevent Japan from becoming a threat to the security of Pacific countries again, it is necessary to control the actions of the Japanese government for a long time. It is reported that Power recently resigned from his current position due to differences of opinion with Australian Foreign Minister Evatt on the policy of controlling Japan. The Sydney Sun commented on this, saying: "The significant changes in the Australian government's policy towards Japan have made the rift between Power and Evatt inevitable"; and pointed out: "Before Evatt went to Tokyo, he shared the same concerns as Power about the possibility of Japanese re-aggression, but after Evatt was allowed to confer with MacArthur for the first time, he changed his attitude."

Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 22nd -- Tokyo News: With the United States' unreserved cultivation, Japan's steel bar production in June reached the level of 1.03 million metric tons per year for the first time. The Minister of the Industry Department of MacArthur Headquarters believes that the increase in output is due to the allocation of coal and the increase in American oil imports. According to the Times News Agency, the US Export-Import Bank is about to grant Japan a credit loan of 57 million US dollars. The loan will be issued by the North American Cotton Bureau, and it is expected that a large amount of American cotton will be imported into Japan in the future.

　　教唆蒋党迫英成立缉私协定
  　美国势力侵入香港
    英自治领驻日代表愤懑美国纵容日寇
    【新华社陕北二十二日电】上海消息：在美国压力下，英国已于十五日在香港总督府与蒋方代表签订“缉私”协定，从此美国势力已可长驱进入华南商业门户与重要战略基地之香港。协定系由蒋记财政部税务署所属海关总税务司与香港英政府所签订，根据该协定之规定，原在美国人员控制下且以美人李度为总税务司的蒋记海关机构，今后即可在香港直接执行“缉私”职务，设立关卡及加强进出香港海面的美化蒋记“缉私”舰队。美国为夺取华南市场的绝对控制权，即积极嗾使蒋方叫嚣收回香港，以便美国实际上占有此战略基地，此项阴谋，至今未能实现，美蒋乃转而在“缉私”问题上大作文章，在美国主动提议下，美蒋双方即于五月二十三日签订所设“烟毒缉私情报交换协定”，进一步确立美国在中国“缉私”行政中之地位，自此香港“走私”问题即被大声吵嚷开来，国民党外交部曾迭次要求英国外交部及香港政府成立一“有效之缉私协定”，英方皆不予置理。魏德迈到华后，对香港方面复施以压力，但英方仍坚持一大部分的走私是中国人得中国政府（指蒋政府）及陆海人员的默许的”，表示“缉私”关键不在香港。八月十二日孙科命去香港见英国总督，魏德迈亦开始其华南之行，最后始有十五日“缉私”协定之订立。
    【新华社陕北二十二日电】东京讯：英自治领对日管制委员会代表兼澳洲驻日联络团团长鲍尔，对麦克阿瑟管制日本深表不满，他提起注意日政府未履行使日本民主化的盟国方针；并认为：欲防止日本再度变为太平洋各国安全之威胁，就必须长期控制日政府之行动。据悉，鲍尔近因对日管制政策与澳外长伊瓦特意见分歧而辞去现职。悉尼太阳报对此评称：“澳政府对日政策的显著改变，使鲍尔与伊瓦特间之裂痕不可避免”；并指出：“在伊瓦特去东京前，他对日本重新侵略之可能性，与鲍尔抱有同样忧虑之感，但从伊瓦特获准第一次和麦克阿瑟会商后，就改变了态度”。
    【新华社陕北二十二日电】东京讯：在美国不遗余力的培育下，日本六月份的钢条生产量首次达到年产一百零三万公吨的水平。麦克阿瑟总部工业部部长认为，产量之提高，系煤的分配及美国石油入口增加之故。另据时代通讯社称：美进出口银行即将予日本五千七百万美元之信用贷款。该贷款将由北美棉业局发放，须料今后将有大批美棉输入日本。
