    Wu Guanying Masses
    Help Military Families Complete Three Weeding
    [This newspaper's Jinan dispatch, 30th] The masses of Wu Guanying Village in Jize County have now helped all military families in the village weed their fields three times. The village has 55 military families, with a total of 570 mu of land. After the land reform, under the leadership of veteran hero Ye Wenzhang and the Production Committee, all the land of the military families was distributed to 56 mutual aid teams for cultivation. In order to provide specific leadership and timely inspection, 12 village cadres were assigned to be responsible for four to five groups each, and a reporting system was established. Therefore, after the first rain, the planting was rushed, and not a single mu of land belonging to military families was missed. Moreover, due to diligent weeding, the seedlings in the fields of military families are now standing straight and tall.

    帮助军属完成三锄
    【本报冀南三十日电】鸡泽县吴官营群众现已帮助全村军属锄过三遍苗。该村五十五户军属，共有地五百七十亩，土地改革后，在老英雄叶文章和生产委员会领导下，把军属的土地全部分给五十六个互助组代耕，又为了具体领导及时检查，十二个村干部分工负责四个到五个组，并建立了汇报制度，因此头遍雨后抢种，没有漏掉军属一亩地，并且由于勤锄搂，现在军属地里的苗已经直挺挺标得多高。
