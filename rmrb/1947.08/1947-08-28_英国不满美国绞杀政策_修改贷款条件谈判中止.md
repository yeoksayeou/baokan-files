　　Britain Dissatisfied with US Policy of Strangulation
  　Modification of Loan Conditions Talks Suspended
    Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, August 25th: Washington dispatch: The Anglo-American meeting on modifying loan conditions, after convening for four days starting on the 18th, announced a "suspension" of discussions on the 22nd due to differences of opinion between the two sides. The chief British representative, Eady, returned home on the 24th to report the progress of the negotiations to the British authorities. According to the US Department of Commerce on the 22nd, negotiations between the two sides on modifying the "non-discrimination" clause "did not yield results" after a day of discussion. Other members of the British delegation remained in Washington after Eady left to discuss technical issues related to the British overseas trade plan concerning the "non-discrimination" clause with the US side. This Anglo-American meeting was convened after Marshall announced on August 6th that he agreed in principle to the modification. When attending the meeting, the British side not only hoped to modify the loan conditions but also wanted to obtain new loan assistance from the United States. However, the US side not only firmly refused to discuss the loan issue but also insisted that the loan conditions remain unchanged unless Britain allows the United States to interfere in its internal affairs and immediately accepts the US Ruhr plan. During the four days of discussion, the US side only agreed that Britain temporarily suspend its obligation to freely convert pound sterling.
    Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, August 24th: Comprehensive Report: On the third day of the Anglo-American meeting on modifying loan conditions (August 20th), according to the agreement between the British and American finance ministers, the United States agreed that Britain temporarily suspend the execution of its obligation of free conversion of pound sterling before a decision is reached on the modification negotiations. That is, except for trade with the United States, which must still be paid in US dollars, trade between Britain and other countries may temporarily not be paid in US dollars. (According to agreements signed by Britain with 48 countries around July 15th, it was stipulated that from July 15th, Britain would pay trade differences with those countries in US dollars). The two sides also agreed that before August 29th, Britain could withdraw 450 million US dollars of the remaining 850 million US dollars from the US loan in three installments to pay for loans already ordered from the United States. The final remaining 400 million US dollars will be frozen until a decision is made on the loan condition modification negotiations. During the negotiations between the two sides, according to an Associated Press dispatch on the 20th, "the United States' obvious determination is to strictly adhere to the loan agreement." Therefore, the above-mentioned actions by the United States are obviously a new calculation against the British side, the purpose of which is to make Britain temporarily alleviate its dollar crisis at the expense of the interests of other small countries. In the end, it will inevitably lead to the affected countries reducing the British market by restricting population methods, thus giving Britain a new blow. The British public opinion has already foreseen this. A London "Financial Times" editorial on the 21st stated: "This kind of breach of contract policy will inevitably cause the most serious impact on the credibility of the British government." The Manchester Guardian further stated: This "will greatly affect the trade of countries that have treaties with Britain, because this move will make those countries suddenly feel that even the most important imported goods are difficult to pay for."
    Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, August 24th: London dispatch: In the Anglo-American negotiations on modifying loan conditions, Wall Street's cold-blooded policy of strangling Britain has aroused pessimism and fear on the British side. A London "Workers' Daily" reporter stated on the 21st: The banking and business community in this city is very panicked. The reporter revealed: The British ambassador to the United States, Inverchapel, when he went to the United States a few days ago, "carried an urgent request for help letter from Bevin to Marshall." However, the US side publicly stated before the meeting: This negotiation will not discuss the issue of new loans to Britain. According to a "Daily Mail" report on the 21st, the conditions for Britain to obtain new US aid are: The first step is "the US government hopes that the British government will clearly tell the US government how its future policies will be." It also stated: The United States "has a clear implication that the condition for Britain to obtain US aid is to stop further plans for nationalizing industries such as steel. Americans believe that industrial nationalization and restricting private rights are dangerous attempts." The "News Chronicle" also said: "The price for Britain to obtain new US aid, according to US requirements, may involve many issues that affect British domestic policy." In connection with this pessimistic situation, according to a US News Service dispatch from Washington on the 21st, the amount of money withdrawn from British banks by pound sterling depositors last week reached more than 232.2 million US dollars. This is comparable to the bank run in the United States in 1933.

　　英国不满美国绞杀政策
  　修改贷款条件谈判中止
    【新华社陕北二十五日电】华府讯：英美修改货款条件的会议，自十八日起开会四天后，因双方意见分歧，于二十二日宣布讨论“中止”。英国首席代表伊地于二十四日回国，向英当局报告谈判经过。据美商务部二十二日宣布，双方关于修改“不歧视”条款的谈判，经过一天的讨论“未得结果”。英代表团其他团员于伊地离美后，仍继续逗留华府，与美方研讨有关“不歧视”条款的英国海外贸易计划之技术问题。按英美此次会谈，系马歇尔于八月六日宣布原则上同意修改后召开者。赴会时，英方不仅希望修改贷款条件，且欲取得美国新贷款之援助。但美方则不仅坚拒讨论款问题，且坚持贷款条件不变，除非英国容许美国干涉其内政与立即接受美国鲁尔计划。四天讨论中，美方仅仅同意英国暂停履行金镑自由兑换义务。
    【新华社陕北二十四日电】综合报导：英美修改贷款条件会议的第三日（二十日），根据英美财长的协议，美国同意在修改谈判未获决定前，英国暂时停止执行其金镑自由兑换义务。即除了同美国的贸易必须仍旧以美元支付外，英国与其他各国的贸易可暂时不以美元支付。（按英国在七月十五日前后，曾与四十八国签订协定，规定自七月十五日起，英国以美元支付各该国贸易差额）。双方并协议，在八月二十九日以前，英国可分三次再提用美国贷款中所余八亿五千万美元中之四亿五千万美元，以支付已向美国定购之贷款。最后剩余之四亿美元，则在贷款条件修改谈判未作决定前予以冻结。在双方谈判中，据美联社二十日电称：“美国明显的决心，是要严格坚持货款协定”。因此美国上述举措，显系对英方的新暗算，其目的在使英国以牺牲其他小国的利益，以暂时缓和其美元危机，而最后则必招致受损各国以限制人口办法，减缩英国市场，而予英国新打击。英舆论对此已有预感，伦敦“财政时报”二十一日社论称：“此种违约政策，必使英国政府之信誉遭受最严重影响。”曼澈斯特导报更称：这“将使与英缔约各国之贸易大受影响，因此举将使各该国突然感到，虽对最重要之入口货，亦难予以支付”。
    【新华社陕北二十四日电】伦敦讯：在美英修改贷款条件谈判中，华尔街趁机绞杀英国的冷酷政策，已引起英国方面的悲观与恐惧。伦敦工人日报记者二十一日称：本市银行界与商界甚为惊慌。该记者透露：英驻美大使殷维却波尔日前赴美时，“曾带有贝文致马歇尔紧急求援信一件。”但美方于会谈前公开声称：此次谈判不谈对英新贷款问题。而据每日邮报廿一日报导英国欲获得美国新援助的条件称：第一步是“美国政府希望英政府将其未来政策如何，明明白白的告诉美国政府。又称：美国“有明显的暗示，英国要获得美国援助的条件为停止钢铁等工业国有化的更进一步计划，美国人认为工业国有化和限制私人权利是危险的尝试。”新闻记事报也说：“英国取得美国新援助的代价，按美国要求，可能涉及影响英国国内政策的许多问题。”与此种悲观情况相联系，据美新闻处华府二十一日电，上星期英镑存户向英国银行提取之款，计达二亿三千二百万美元以上。堪与一九三三年美国各银行之提存风潮相比。
