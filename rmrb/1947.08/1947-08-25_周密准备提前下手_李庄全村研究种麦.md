　　Careful Preparation, Early Start
　　Li Village Studies Wheat Planting as a Whole Village
　　[Our Newspaper, Licheng News] Under the promotion and leadership of labor heroes Zhao Feng and Zhao Guangxing, the whole village of Lizhuang Village in the first district has hoed 874 mu of corn three times, 764 mu of grain twice, and 230 mu of cotton five times. On the night of the 16th of this month, political director Zhao Gengwang led the masses to discuss in groups at the People's School, setting out a 20-day plan, mainly to compost fertilizer for wheat fields, plow wheat fields twice, repair wheat fields, transport fertilizer, and collect firewood. During the discussion at the general meeting, peasant Zhao Xiangqin (mutual aid team leader) who had turned over, said: "This year, due to prolonged drought and lack of rain, the autumn crops only have half a harvest. Our soil here is thick and the land is wide. Judging from the current situation, there must be a lot of rain this autumn, so planting more wheat is most suitable. For example, last year there was a lot of autumn rain, and the wheat planted did not get any rain in the spring this year, but generally still yielded more than five dou in the summer, which is enough to withstand one shi of grain, which is not worse than a good harvest of autumn crops. I think we must plant more stubble wheat, and apply more fertilizer to the wheat fields. As the saying goes: 'Planting wheat is like piling fertilizer, harvesting is like a pile of wheat.' Last year, our team applied an average of 25 loads per mu, and this year we will apply an average of 35 loads, guaranteeing an increase of half a dou of wheat per mu. We must also select technicians to ensure deep plowing, careful cultivation, and more fertilizer, especially deep plowing and careful cultivation. It is often said: 'Autumn fields (autumn crops) come from the hoe, and summer fields come from the plow.' Our team's 60 mu of wheat fields must be plowed three times, and sown ten days earlier. As the saying goes: 'White Dew in the seventh month, rush to sow later; White Dew in the eighth month, rush to sow earlier.' This year, White Dew falls on the 24th of the seventh month, but the leap month is full, just like the eighth month in previous years, so we must sow early, and sow more. Our team will plant three-tenths of wheat." Mutual aid team leader Liu Kui said: "Our team will plant 20 mu of stubble wheat in our 40 mu of corn, and 20 mu of stubble wheat in our 40 mu of grain fields. Including the 44 mu of first crop wheat in our team, there will be a total of 84 mu. Our team has 12 households and 37 people, averaging 2 mu of wheat per person. Now we must hoe the cornfields for wheat four times, and the fourth hoeing must be particularly deep. After the four hoeings are completed, we will carry night soil, oil cakes, etc. while the corn is still growing, and plant wheat in the middle of the ridges. After autumn, we will hoe the field clean, and then use a [?] fine pass again, which can withstand the yield of the first crop wheat." After collective discussion, a wheat planting plan was formulated: the whole village has 84 draught animals, planting 860 mu of first crop wheat, and plans to plant 520 mu of stubble wheat. Each mutual aid team selects one person (with skills) per draught animal to plow the land. Fertilizer transportation, plowing wheat fields twice, and repairing wheat field embankments have already begun. The whole village has now accumulated 30,100 loads of pen manure (including composted wheat bran fertilizer), 640 oil cakes (the whole village had three oil mills last winter), and two flocks of sheep have bedded on 170 mu of wheat fields. The whole village has accumulated a total of 41,050 loads of fertilizer, which is enough for 1,180 mu, and the first stubble wheat fields have been fertilized, but there are still 210 mu without fertilizer. The current plan is to reclaim 100 mu of barren fertilizer, cut artemisia to compost 50 mu of green manure, and the two flocks of sheep can bed on another 60 mu. We will continue to accumulate a large amount of fertilizer, and strive to apply 40 loads per mu of stubble wheat fields. Depending on the livestock conditions in the whole village, all wheat fields can be plowed three times. Volunteer teacher Liu Fengchang proposed: "We must ensure that every household plants more wheat and applies enough fertilizer, and that the summer yield is like a pile of wheat. We must plow the wheat fields thoroughly, and generally achieve deep plowing and careful cultivation. The sowing of first crop wheat should be completed by the end of this month."

　　周密准备提前下手
  　李庄全村研究种麦
    【本报黎城讯】一区李庄村在劳动英雄赵峰、赵广兴推动领导下，全村玉茭八百七十四亩已普遍锄过三次，谷七百六十四亩普遍锄过了二次，棉花二百三十亩已锄过了五次。本月十六号夜，政治主任赵庚旺领导群众在民校分组讨论，订出二十天计划，主要是沤积麦田肥料，耕二犁麦地，修理麦地，运肥，打柴。在大会讨论时，翻身农民赵香芹（互助组长）说：“今年因久旱缺雨，秋庄稼只有半成收成，咱这里土厚地广，按现在看，今秋的雨一定多，多种麦子最适宜。比如去年秋雨多，种的麦子今年一春没下雨，夏天一般还收五大斗多，足顶住一石谷，比上秋庄稼的好年景收成还不差，我想咱们必多种改茬麦，麦田还要多上肥料。俗话说：种麦比肥堆，收时比麦堆。我组去年每亩地平均上到了二十五驮，今年要平均上到三十五驮，保证每亩要增产半斗麦子；还要选上技术人，要做到深耕细作多上肥，特别是深耕细耕。常说：秋田（秋庄稼）出在锄头上，夏田出在犁头上。我组六十亩麦地要普遍耕三遍，还要提前十天下种，俗话说：七月白露赶后种，八月白露赶前种。今年是七月二十四交白露，但是润月足，和往年八月交节一样，所以须早种，还要多种，我组要种十分之三麦子。”刘魁互助组长说：“我组今年四十亩玉茭，要种二十亩茬麦，谷地四十亩要改二十亩茬麦，连上全组的四十四亩正茬麦，共八十四亩。我组共十二户三十七人，每人平均二亩麦，现要将麦的玉茭地全要锄四次，第四次锄的特别深；四次锄毕，玉茭还长着就担上圊，油饼等，从垄当中栽麦，秋后锄净地，再用＠细上一遍，能顶住正茬麦收成。”经过集体讨论，订出种麦计划：全村八十四个畜力，种正茬麦八百六十亩，计划种改茬麦五百二十亩，按互助组每犋牲口选出一人（有技术）耕地，现已开始运肥，翻二犁麦地，修理麦地边堰。全村现已积起圈肥三万零一百驮（沤的麦糠肥在内），油饼（去冬全村有三座油坊）六百四十个，两群羊已卧麦地一百七十亩，全村计共积起肥四万一千零五十驮，已够一千一百八十亩，正改茬麦地上了，还空二百一十亩没肥。现计划揭荒肥一百亩，割蒿沤绿肥五十亩，二群羊还能再卧六十亩，再继续大量积肥，茬麦地每亩要争取上四十驮。麦田根据全村畜力条件，全麦地能普遍耕到三遍。义务教员刘逢昌提出：“咱们要家家做到多种麦上饱肥，夏天比麦堆，要把麦地翻透，普遍做到深耕细作，正茬麦在本月底完成下种。”（庆堂、乃堂、乃文、兰廷、占魁、得文、逢昌）
