    Border Region Literary and Art Awards to be Announced Soon
    [Our Newspaper] The Border Region Literary and Art Awards work, after a year of effort by the Awards Committee, has achieved preliminary results. Various literary and artistic works solicited and recommended from various regions were reviewed by relevant cultural, news publishing organizations, and propaganda and education departments hired by the Awards Committee. A total of more than one hundred kinds of excellent literary and artistic creations, news communications, scripts, magazines, and teaching materials at all levels have won the Border Region Literary and Art Award. People's writer Zhao Shuli's works won a special bonus. Xinhua Bookstore has reprinted most of the preliminary award-winning works to introduce them to the Central Propaganda Department. This Border Region Literary and Art Awards event was hosted by the Education Department of the Border Government. It launched a call for papers in April last year to promote a mass writing movement, to reflect the glorious history of the region's eight-year War of Resistance and the people's struggle for land reform and protection. Last October, the entire region entered the Patriotic War, and the Awards Committee once again issued a call for papers, emphasizing that literary and artistic activities should serve the Patriotic Self-Defense War. Comrades who love creation in various regions have successively responded to the call for literary and artistic works, totaling more than 300 pieces. The Border Government's Federation of Literary and Art Circles and Xinhua Bookstore were responsible for collecting more than 300 kinds of works, including books, newspapers, teaching materials, and mass creations from the front and rear. The Awards Committee specially hired the Border Region Federation of Literary and Art Circles, Xinhua Bookstore, Education Department, Military Region Political Department, and this newspaper to be responsible for the selection of literary and artistic works, news, magazines, teaching materials, and other works. The selection criteria are based on the ability to reflect the region's actual struggles, to use popular language of the masses in writing, and to reflect the lives of the masses; for works by general new writers, as long as they can reflect the real life of the masses, have good content, and have slightly poor technical skills, they will be included as much as possible to encourage mass creation. Works recommended by various regions have been carefully evaluated by the Awards Committee, taking into account the development of literary and educational work and the level of creation in various regions. For the large number of mass creations in various regions, the existing recorded texts shall prevail. Mass drama performances and unwritten clapper talk, dramas, etc. will not be awarded. Because there are very few submissions of fine arts and music, they have not been awarded for the time being. All kinds of works will soon be formally approved by the Awards Committee, and the Border Government will announce the awarding of bonuses, which will be announced in the near future. (Bing Ru)

    边区文教作品评奖不日揭晓
    【本报讯】边区文教作品评奖工作，经评奖委员会一年努力，已获初步结果。各地应征及推荐文教作品，由评委会聘请有关文化、新闻出版机关、宣教部门等分别担任审阅，共有各种优秀文艺创作，新闻通讯，剧本，杂志各级教材一百余种荣获边区文教奖金。人民作家赵树理作品获得特别奖金。新华书店已将初步评奖作品大部翻印向中宣部介绍。此次边区文教作品评奖由边府教育厅主持，曾于去年四月发起征文号召开展群众性写作运动，以反映本区八年抗战光辉史迹及人民翻身保田等现实斗争。去年十月全区进入爱国战争，评奖委员会曾再次发出征文号召，强调文艺活动为爱国自卫战争服务。各区爱好创作同志先后应征文艺作品共三百余件，经边府文联、新华书店负责搜集前后方书报教材群众创作等作品三百种以上。评奖委员会特聘请边区文联、新华书店、教育厅、军区政治部及本报分别担负文艺、新闻、杂志、教材等作品评选工作。评选标准以能反映本区现实斗争，在写作上能运用群众化通俗语言，反映群众生活者；对一般新作家的作品则只要能反映群众现实生活，内容好，技术上稍差也尽量入选，以鼓励群众性的创作。经由各区推荐作品，均经评委会慎重评选，适当照顾各地文教工作发展及创作水平。对各地区大量群众创作，以搜集现存之记载文字为准，至于群众戏剧演出及没成文之快板，话剧等未能予以评奖。因应征美术、音乐稿件很少，亦暂未评奖。现各种作品即将由评委会最后正式通过，由边府公布颁发奖金，不日即可揭晓。（冰如）
