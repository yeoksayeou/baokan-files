Using the Language of the Masses to Open Up Mass Thought
	Ganji Develops Experience in Carrying Out a Fertilizer Accumulation Campaign
[This newspaper, Jinan, 26th] Ganji in Wei County has a high level of enthusiasm for accumulating fertilizer, accumulating 489 cartloads of fertilizer in half a month. The experience is as follows: (1) Using the language of the masses makes it easier to open up the thinking of the masses, such as "People treat the land well, the land treats people well" and "Farming without fertilizer is equal to blind messing around," which have played a warning and motivating role for the masses; (2) Accurate accounting showed that 18 hectares of wheat land were still short 1,960 cartloads of fertilizer. After repeated mobilization, the masses overcame their fear of trouble, "What's the hurry?" and other paralyzing thoughts; (3) Taking advantage of the mobilization enthusiasm, challenges were launched between streets and streets, groups and groups, people and people, encouraging everyone's enthusiasm and creativity, such as coming up with ideas to raise cattle together, feed more pigs and sheep, compost green grass, repair pig pens, sweep locust flowers, burn bone ash, scrape pot ash, and other methods to increase fertilizer; now the whole village has newly added 14 cattle and 32 pigs. For example, Yu Kui used field-edge soil and dry soil from the road to compost fertilizer, accumulating three more cartloads of fertilizer in half a month than others. Jing Hongbo used manure as a starter and added water, soil, and grass to trample fertilizer, accumulating 23 more cartloads of fertilizer in half a month; (4) Mobilizing women and children to increase fertilizer accumulation labor. For example, under the leadership of women An Jingwen and children Zhu Wenlan, 23 people dug 16 manure pits and proposed "Three Diligence Movements" (diligently washing clothes, diligently scrubbing pots, diligently sweeping houses and courtyards) and "Three Picking Movements" (picking watermelon rinds, picking manure, picking firewood), which have had great results; (5) Combining merit-based recognition with timely inspection, and using group leader joint meetings to exchange experiences to promote fertilizer accumulation. Jing Hongbo and Wang Guangqun were elected as fertilizer accumulation models, and the leadership proposed learning from them to mobilize backward people. Meng Xiaofu said: "I used to think that even if I wasted things, I could still get a share, but I was wrong." He overcame the phenomenon of eating and drinking excessively, carried a manure basket to accumulate fertilizer, and became prosperous through labor; (6) Fertilizer accumulation has solved the problem of surplus labor in mutual aid. During the half-month of fertilizer accumulation, the original 23 mutual aid groups were further consolidated, and nine new mutual aid groups were developed.

　　运用群众的话打通群众思想
  　干集开展积肥运动经验
    【本报冀南廿六日电】威县干集积肥热情高，半月积肥四百八十九车。其经验：（一）用群众的话易打通群众的思想，如“人哄地，地哄人”“种地不上粪，等于瞎胡混”等，对群众都起了警惕与鼓动作用；（二）精确算帐，说明十八顷麦地尚差一千九百六十车粪，翻复动员后，克服了群众怕费劲，“慌啥”等麻痹思想；（三）趁动员热气，发动了街与街、组与组、人与人挑战，鼓励大家的积极性与创造性，如想出伙喂牛、多喂猪羊、沤青草、修猪圈、扫槐花、烧骨灰、刮锅底灰等办法增加肥料；现全村已新添十四头牛、三十二口猪。又如玉魁用场边土和道上干土沤粪，半月比别人多积肥三车，井宏波以大粪作酸头和上水、土、草踏粪，半月多积肥二十三车；（四）发动妇女儿童，增加积肥劳力。如妇女安敬文和儿童朱文兰带领下，二十三人挖粪坑十六个，并提出：“三勤运动”（勤洗衣、勤刷锅、勤扫屋院）和“三拾运动”（拾西瓜皮、拾粪、拾柴）收效很大；（五）结合立功表模，及时进行检查，并利用组长联席会交流经验推动积肥。选举了井宏波、王光群为积肥模范，领导上提出向他俩学习，发动落后人。孟小符说：“我过去以为浪费了还能分东西，原来我想错了。”克服了大吃大喝现象，背起粪筐积肥，发家致富靠劳动；（六）通过积肥解决了互助剩余劳动力问题，半月积肥中，原有的二十三个互助组，更加巩固了，并且新发展了九个互助组。
