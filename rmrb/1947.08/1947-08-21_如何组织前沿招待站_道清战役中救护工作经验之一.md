How to Organize a Forward Reception Station
One of the Experiences in Rescue Work During the Daqing Campaign

　　A forward reception station refers to a reception station that follows the surgical teams at the front. This type of station is generally set up in enemy-occupied areas close to the front lines or in guerrilla areas where the enemy has the upper hand. In terms of timing, it is almost always the evening of the day the troops are engaged in combat that they can enter the base, and they have to leave at dawn. The difficulties encountered here are that there is no one in the village, and it is impossible to get people or supplies. How can these difficulties be solved?

　　First, bring reinforcements – bring a group of women and children from the rear. The number does not have to be large; one or two dozen will do. Their main roles are two-fold: (1) to meet emergency needs and prevent not being able to find people immediately, let them start the reception first, while giving the local organization time to prepare the masses. (2) To play a leading role. Because the local people do not know us very well, nor do they understand how to conduct receptions. In the method of bringing reinforcements, do not bring them too far; if they are too far away, problems will arise. You can change them frequently. For example, bring the women and children from location A to location B for reception. When location B is organized, you can bring those from location B and let those from location A go back, but they cannot return empty-handed.

　　Second, how to organize the local people to carry out the reception? Two methods were also used here: (1) If arriving early (meaning before dark), you can gather all the men, women, and children in the village as soon as you get there, hold a comprehensive meeting, and conduct a general mobilization and organization, assigning "what the men do" and "what the women do." (2) But usually you arrive after dark, so holding a mass meeting is not feasible. Therefore, we mostly adopt the method of mobilizing and organizing household by household. It is best to combine with the street chief, finding people while mobilizing and organizing. Organize them as soon as you find a dozen people, and appoint a leader (be sure to find a responsible person, otherwise it will be difficult to find them). This method may initially cause panic among the masses, but once they actually participate in the reception, all doubts are dispelled. When attacking Mulandian and Xiuwu, we used this method in Fucun, Wuzhi, and Xibanqiao, Xiuwu. In the beginning, everyone declined, but after one reception, the women in Fucun, after hosting in the morning, came early in the afternoon without even being called, saying, "So that's what we're doing. If I had known earlier, I wouldn't have waited to be asked to come."

　　In addition, two things should be noted in mobilization and organization: (1) The mobilization should be simple, powerful, and touching, such as the mobilization at Mulandian: "Do you want to attack Mulandian or not?" "If you want to attack, there are people fighting for us in the front. If they are wounded, can we take care of them?" (2) Mobilization should be combined with the actual interests of the masses, such as saying: "They are all from all over the country, leaving their parents and wives to come here to fight Mulandian for us. For whose sake?" etc. In organization: (1) Just appoint a leader (be sure to write down the leader's name and family members), not necessarily a formal title such as "group leader" or "team leader," etc., because the masses are afraid of being taken advantage of, and no one wants to accept the title. (2) When choosing a person in charge, observe the expressions of the masses. Because no one wants to be responsible, and at the same time, everyone is afraid of recommending others, so when you ask them to choose, they will never propose someone directly. The women always push each other, looking at each other. Whoever everyone wants to do it, everyone looks at her. At this time, you propose to let her do it, and let everyone approve it.

　　Third, it is necessary to establish close contact with the county and district headquarters, and it is best to have the local district chief serve as the stationmaster, so that all kinds of temporary difficulties can be resolved in a timely manner. For example, in Xibanqiao, the army had already entered the battle without any preparation. It was only organized after the district chief was called to organize it together. As this village was small and lacked supplies, most of them were borrowed from neighboring villages through the district chief. If this is not done, the task will be difficult to complete.

　　如何组织前沿招待站
  　道清战役中救护工作经验之一
    前沿招待站，是指跟随前边军队手术组的招待站，这种站，一般都设在离火线较近的顽占区或敌人占优势的游击区，而在时间上，又差不多都是在部队进行战斗的当天晚上才能进入驻地，赶天明就要下来彩号，这里遇到的困难是，村里没人，要不到人，要不到东西。怎样解决这种困难呢？
    第一、是带援兵——从后边带上一部妇女儿童，数目不一定多，有一、二十个就行。他们的作用，主要有二：（一）是以应急需，防止一时找不到人，让他们先来招待，同时给予当地组织群众的准备时间。（二）是起带头作用。因当地群众对我们不很了解，也不懂如何进行招待。在带援兵的方法上，不要带的太远，远了就要发生问题，可经常更换一下。如在甲地带的妇女儿童到乙地去招待，当将乙地组织好后，就可把乙地的带上，让甲地的回去，但手里不能脱空。
    第二、如何组织当地群众进行招待？这里也用了两个办法：（一）去的早时（指天不黑），可以一到那里就把村中男女老少都集合起来，开个一揽子会，进行总的动员和组织，“男人干啥”，“女人干啥”分配好。（二）但一般都是天黑以后才去，这样开大会不行，因此多采取挨户动员组织办法，最好能结合街长，边找人，边动员与组织。找上十几个人就给他组织起来，按上个头头（一定要找个负责人，不然不好找），这种办法开始可能使群众发生惊恐，但一经实际招待，就疑团全释。在打木栾店和修武时，我们在武陟傅村和修武西板桥，就都是采取这种办法。开始谁也推托，但招待过一遍后，傅村妇女上午招待过，下午没等叫她们就早来了，并说：“原来是干这，早知道就不叫我们也来”。
    另外在动员和组织上应注意两件事：（一）在动员时要简单有力，动人，如打木栾店的动员：“你想叫打木栾店不想”，“想叫打现在就有人在前边给咱们打，挂了彩，咱们可以不可以招呼一下！”（三）动员要与群众实际利益结合，如说：“他们都是山南海北哩，离开了父母妻子来这里给我们打木栾店，为了谁”等。在组织上：（一）只要按个头头就行（要把这头头的名字及家人都记下来），不一定非按个什么名堂，如“小组长”“队长”等，因群众怕吃亏，谁都不想应这名字。（二）选择负责人时要看群众的表情，因谁也不愿负责，同时谁也怕提别人，故你叫他选时她总不会直爽爽地给你提出来，妇女们总是你挤我，我瞧你，凡是大家想叫谁干的，大家都瞅着她，这时你就提出叫她干，让大家通过就行了。
    第三、是要与县区指挥部取得密切联系，顶好叫当地区长当站长，一切临时发生的各种困难都可及时解决。如在西板桥就是军队已进入战斗还没一点准备，将区长叫来共同组织才组织起来。如这村又小啥用具也少，多是经区长向邻村借来的。不如此作，任务难完成。（志鹏、洁生）
