Shahe and Wu'an
　　600,000 Mu of Crash Planting Completed
　　[Dispatch from our reporters on the 9th] Shahe County has completed all its planting and is now vigorously organizing weeding. After a thorough rain on the 28th of last month, the county proposed: "Rush to plant late crops, two fen of vegetables per person." Some of the masses were not enthusiastic, especially in the paddy fields and some areas with seedlings. The masses in Nanwang said: "It is better to water two mu of seedlings than to plant two mu more. With a few mu of seedlings, whether or not we plant vegetables, we can't stand the suffering!" The masses in Jizhuang said: "Our village is flooded with dry land, and drought with paddy fields. Although the famine in the thirty-second year of the Republic of China (1943) was not light, it was a once-in-a-thousand-year event." The masses in Xicui Village said: "Radishes in the first ten days of the lunar month, vegetables in the second, and buckwheat only in the third. Let's wait a few more days, it's too early!" The leadership seized these paralyzing thoughts and immediately went deep into the masses to discover positive factors in order to combat these ideological obstacles with the masses' own experiences. Li Sanni from Xicui said: "In the thirty-second year of the Republic, it rained once, and people planted vegetables. I said it was too early, let's wait a few days, but it never rained again. I still regret it now!" Li Quanrong said: "That year I planted five mu of millet and three fen of turnips. The locusts ate all the millet, and my family of four depended entirely on those three fen of vegetables to get through. No matter what, I have to plant a mu and a half of vegetables tomorrow." The crops in the Jizhuang paddy fields were growing very well, but a hailstorm wiped them out a month ago. The elderly people said: "Only when the wheat is on the threshing floor and the grain is in the warehouse can we judge the year's harvest." The leadership unified the masses' thinking with these specific facts, and the crash planting quickly formed a mass movement. The Sixth District organized 2,388 livestock to participate in the crash planting in one day, and eliminated the wasteland in four days, planting a total of 5,106.8 mu of buckwheat, 3,457.9 mu of vegetables, and 1,183.6 mu of late crops such as millet and corn. According to a responsible comrade of the county, the county has a total of 520,000 mu of land. More than 300,000 mu in the areas where it rained earlier and the paddy fields already had seedlings. After this rain, more than 200,000 mu were planted. In addition to the revival of one-third of the seedlings in the hailstorm area, they have also been replanted. As long as there are no accidents in the future, it is estimated that the former will have a 60-70% harvest, and the latter will have a 40-50% harvest, with an overall average of about 50-60%.

　　[Special Dispatch from our Newspaper] In Wu'an, the First, Second, Third, Fourth, and Eighth Districts, about 400,000 mu of wasteland were all eliminated within four days after a thorough rain on the 28th of last month. In the mass rush-planting upsurge, positive opinions such as "Don't be afraid to die raising children, don't be afraid to lose planting land," "Feed the big and fat to death, starve the small and lean to death," "Fight back with the seed drill on June 6th of the lunar calendar," and "Planting one *xiang* early is better than manure" replaced the old views of hoeing small seedlings at the Beginning of Autumn, planting "gourds to get two ladles," and "not throwing away beans at the Beginning of the Hot Season." All livestock, labor, and the vast majority of women and children participated in the rush planting. In Zhaoxian Village in the Second District, there were seven *qing* of wasteland and eight *qing* of land with missing seedlings. The original plan was to complete the rush planting and replanting in three days. Because the cadres took the lead, more than 100 livestock and nearly 300 laborers in the village carried out a general mobilization, and the entire area was planted in two days. The past complaints about mutual aid groups being "muddled groups" and "substitute farming groups" have completely disappeared. The masses in Zhuangziying and other places in the Eighth District changed the old experience of "plowing the stubble after the wheat harvest" to "hoeing the stubble after the wheat harvest" to adapt to the new situation. According to the old experience, a large part of the stubble land would be left to "plow" the land in the autumn to plant "slaughter wheat" (only harvesting one season of wheat is called "slaughter wheat"); according to the new slogan, all the autumn crops can be planted together, just plant more corn. Because the corn ridges are wide, wheat can be planted in rows later, which will not affect the wheat harvest next year. The wheat fields cannot be plowed this year. Hoeing them several more times next year will be fine, which is what is meant by "hoeing the stubble after the wheat harvest." These creations were all decided after widespread discussions among the masses during the rain, unifying their thinking, so the enthusiastic rush planting started immediately after the heavy rain stopped.

　　沙河·武安
  　六十万亩抢种完毕
    【本报记者团九日电】沙河全县已全部完成下种，目下正大力组织锄苗。上月二十八日普落透雨，该县即提出：“抢种晚作物，每人二分菜。”部分群众并不热心，尤以水田和部分有苗地区为最。南汪群众说：“多种二亩不如多浇二亩苗。有几亩苗，种菜不种菜吧，反正受不了罪啦！”冀庄群众说：“俺村淹了有旱地，旱了有水田，三十二年灾荒虽然也不轻，但那是千年不遇的事情。”西崔村群众说：“头伏萝卜、二伏菜、三伏才能种荞麦，再等两天吧，早哩！”领导上抓住这些麻痹思想，立即深入群众发掘积极因素，以便用群众自己的体验向这些思想障碍作斗争。西崔李三妮说：“三十二年下了回雨，人家都种菜，我说早哩，等两天吧，可是以后再也没下雨，现在想起来还后悔哩！”李全荣说：“那年我种了五亩谷子三分蔓菁，闹蚂蚱把谷子都吃光了，我一家四口就全凭那三分菜渡过来的，不管怎样，明天我得种他一亩半菜。”冀庄水地庄稼长的很好，月前一场冰雹打了个净光，老年人说：“麦子上了场，谷子进了库，才能评年景的好赖”。领导上以这些具体事实统一了群众思想，抢种便很快形成了群众运动。六区一天组织了二千三百八十八头牲口参加抢种，四天即将白地消灭，共种荞麦五千一百零六亩八、菜三千四百五十七亩九、谷子玉茭等晚作物一千一百八十三亩六。据该县某负责同志谈：全县共有五十二万亩地，部分先落雨区和水地区已有苗者三十余万亩，此次雨后又有二十余万亩下种；雹灾区除三分之一的苗子复活外，此次亦都补种完毕。只要今后不生意外，估计前者有六、七成收，后者有四、五成年景，整个平均约五、六成。（林里）
    【本报特讯】武安一、二、三、四、八各区约四十万亩白地，已于上月二十八日透雨后四天内全部消灭。群众抢种浪潮中，“养儿不怕死，种地不怕赔”，“撑死肥大、饿死肥小”，“六月六、争回耧”，“早种一垧顶上粪”。等积极舆论，代替了过去的立秋锄小苗、种“葫芦打两瓢”，“入伏不丢豆”等老论调。全部牲口、劳力、与绝大部分妇女、儿童，都参加抢种。二区招贤村有白地七顷，缺苗地八顷，原计划三天抢种补种完，因干部带头，全村一百多牲口与近三百劳力实行总动员大工，两天即全部种完。过去所谓互助组是“糊涂组”，“代耕组”等牢骚不满，完全消除了。八区庄子营等地群众把“麦收犁垧”的老经验改成“麦收锄垧”，适应了新的情况。按老经验，就要留很大一部分茬地，等秋天“犁”地种杀麦（光收一季麦为杀麦）；按新口号，都可一齐种秋，只是多种些玉茭就行。因为玉茭垄背宽，将来可以串麦，不影响明年收麦。麦地今年不能犁。明年多锄几遍也行，此即所谓“麦收锄垧”。以上这些创造都是在下雨时经群众普遍讨论决定，统一了思想，所以大雨一停热烈的抢种即马上开始。（而东）
