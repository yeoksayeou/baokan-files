　　Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, August 11th: TASS Moscow, August 5th: Academician Varga of the Soviet Academy of Sciences recently published an article in Pravda entitled "The Approaching American Economic Crisis and the 'Marshall Plan'." He wrote: Six months ago we wrote that the next outbreak of the American economic crisis would not be later than 1948. During this period, the development of the American economy indicated that the preconditions for the crisis are rapidly maturing. In fact, the crisis may have already begun; but it will take some time to be precise. In the past few months, there has been no increase in production as there was in the second half of last year, and the quantity of manufactured goods piled up in factories and in the warehouses of wholesalers and retailers has increased; according to the latest figures, the total value of American commodity inventories has reached almost $35 billion. Today, the crisis is recognized as imminent throughout the United States. However, the word "crisis" is cautiously avoided, and replaced by less harmful words such as "depression" and so on. It is ridiculous that Truman has suggested to capitalists that they automatically reduce prices to prevent the arrival of the crisis. Because capitalists are never willing to automatically reduce prices when there is still an opportunity to sell goods to obtain higher profits. But even if American capitalists adopt this method now, it will only accelerate the arrival of the crisis. Since everyone hopes that prices will fall, they will temporarily wait to buy in the future, manufacturers and merchants will delay their orders to sell off inventories, and private individuals will temporarily stop buying cars, furniture, clothing, socks, etc. The result will be a sharp drop in prices immediately. The decline in prices will not be due to the voluntary actions of capitalists, but the price drop will be sharp and will be forced by the crisis. The monopolistic capital of the United States is trying to ease the crisis, and wants to avoid the inevitable price drop by stepping up the sale of goods in the world market that they cannot sell in the domestic market (because of the high prices and the unfair distribution of current national income). However, the vast majority of capitalist countries now have no dollars or gold to buy American goods. Countries impoverished by the war have no surplus goods to sell to the United States in exchange for American goods. Even if they have any goods to export, sales are hindered by excessively high American tariffs. The "Marshall Plan" should be seen for what it is from the above facts. The economic significance of this "plan" is to provide the United States with the opportunity to sell its goods in foreign markets without having to import from abroad; thereby alleviating the imminent American crisis and postponing the price drop. The "Marshall Plan" also has far-reaching political goals in Europe, which can be summarized as follows: First, to establish a Western European group under American control; the only trend of this group will be anti-Soviet. In this regard, the "Marshall Plan" represents an attempt to expand the Truman policy pursued in Greece and Iran to the whole of Europe. The second goal of the "Marshall Plan" is to transform Germany (excluding the Soviet occupation zone) into a military base for American imperialism in the center of Europe. The creators of the "Marshall Plan" are trying to cunningly remove Britain's control over the Ruhr in this way; and retain private ownership of German enterprises. They are planning to restore the industry of the Ruhr with the help of American engineers and US$300 million in financial assistance. The "Marshall Plan" requires France to supply the Ruhr area with 6 million tons of iron seedlings every year. On this basis, they are planning to restore German heavy industry to its pre-war level. Obviously, it goes without saying that this plan has encountered obstacles from Britain and France. France opposes this plan because France rightfully believes that it threatens their security. Britain also opposes this plan because it deprives Britain of a valuable source of income—the Ruhr. The third goal of the "Marshall Plan" is to separate Eastern European countries, especially the new democracies, from the influence of Soviet foreign policy, and to win them over to the United States, thereby turning these countries into ordinary capitalist countries and guiding their policies in the old bourgeois way. European countries that correctly value their respective national interests have refused to pay such a high price for obtaining American "aid." Due to the refusal of all Eastern European countries to participate in the implementation of this "plan," the "Marshall Plan" encountered a serious failure. The plan proposed by the authors of this plan regarding the German issue caused opposition in Britain and France, indicating that the negotiations on this plan will take longer and be more complicated than they expected. Opposition to the "Marshall Plan" is growing among the working people of Europe and progressive Americans. It can be seen that the now imminent American economic crisis seems likely to break out before this plan is successfully completed. And when the crisis breaks out, American taxpayers may object to withdrawing new huge loans from the national treasury. Therefore, it must not be assumed that the implementation of the "Marshall Plan" (which primarily serves the economic and foreign policy interests of American monopoly capital) has any guarantee. From the recent American economic statistics, the above are some issues that should be remembered and considered when discussing the "Marshall Plan".

　　瓦尔加发表论文
  　美经济危机行将到来
    【新华社陕北十一日电】塔斯社莫斯科五日电：苏联科学院大学士瓦尔加顷在真理报撰文，题为“行将到来的美国经济危机与‘马歇尔计划’”。他写道：六个月以前我们曾经写过，下一次美国经济危机的爆发，将不会迟于一九四八年。在这一时期内，美国经济的发展表示了危机的前提条件正在迅速成熟。实际上，危机很可能已经开始；但要确切地说明它，还要等到稍后才行。在过去数月内，已经不再有去年下半年那样的生产增加，堆积在工厂里，在批发商与零售商的仓库里的制造品的数量，愈益增多；据最近的数字，美国商品存货的总价值已达到几乎三百五十亿美元。今天，在整个美国都公认危机是迫近了。可是“危机”这个字被审慎地避免使用，而代以较无害的字眼，如“萧条”等等。杜鲁门曾向资本家建议自动减低物价以阻挡危机之到来，这真是可笑之至。因为资本家在货物还有脱售以获取较高利润的机会时，是决不愿自动减低物价的。但即令美国资本家们现在采用这种办法，这也只会加速危机的到来。每个人既然都抱着物价将要降低的希望，就会暂时都期待着将来购买，制造业者和商人都会延缓他们的定货而去脱售存货，私人方面就会暂时停止购买汽车、家具、衣料及鞋袜等。结果就会是物价立即发生惨跌。物价的下降将不是由于资本家方面自愿的行动，跌价将是尖锐的，而且将是危机所逼成的。美国的独占资本竭力想缓和危机，并且想以加紧在世界市场上出售他们在国内市场所卖不掉（因为物价太高和现时国民收入的不公平分配）的物品，来避免那不可避免的跌价。可是，绝大多数资本主义国家现在没有美元或黄金可以购买美国货。为战争所贫穷了的国家，又没有剩余的物品可以卖给美国，以换购美货。即使它们有任何物品可以输出，销售也受到了美国过度高额关税的妨碍。“马歇尔计划”就应该从上述的事实中窥视其真面目。这个“计划”的经济意义，就是提供美国以无须从国外输入而在国外市场销售其货品的机会；从而就可以缓和迫在眉睫的美国危机，并延期跌价，“马歇尔计划”还有其在欧洲的远大政治目标，可以概括如下：第一，成立在美国控制下的西欧集团；这一集团唯一的趋向便将是反苏。在这方面，“马歇尔计划”代表了一种企图即想把在希土和伊朗所奉行的杜鲁门政策，扩大到整个欧洲。“马歇尔计划”的第二个目标就是想把德国（苏军占领区除外）转成为美国帝国主义在欧洲中心的军事基地。“马歇尔计划”的制作者就是以这种诡计竭力要解除英国对鲁尔的控制权；并保留德国企业的私人所有权。他们正计划以美国工程师的帮助与美国三亿元财政资助，以恢复鲁尔的工业。“马歇尔计划”对法国所提的要求，便是每年以六百万吨铁苗供应鲁尔区。在这个基础上他们正计划恢复德国重工业几及其战前水平。显然不用说，这个计划遇到了英国和法国方面的阻碍。法国之反对这一计划是因为法国正当地认为这是威胁了他们的安全。在英国且反对这一计划的原因是它剥夺了英国宝贵的收入来源——鲁尔。“马歇尔计划”的第三个目标就是使东欧各国特别是新民主主义国家脱离苏联外交政策的影响，并且争取它们到美国那边去，从而把这些国家转成普通的资本主义国家，并以旧的资产阶级的办法指导它们的政策。正确地重视它们各自的民族利益的欧洲国家，已经拒绝了为获得美国的“援助”而付出这样贵的价钱。由于所有东欧国家拒绝参加这一“计划”之执行，“马歇尔计划”遭遇到了严重的失败。这一计划作者关于德国问题所提的方案在英法所引起的反对，表示了关于这一计划的谈判将较他们预计的旷时更久和更加复杂化。对“马歇尔计划”的反对，正在欧洲劳动人民与美国进步分子中增长着。由此可见，现在已经迫在眉睫的美国经济危机，似乎将可能在这一计划未顺利完成之前即行爆发。而且当危机爆发时，美国的纳税人可能将反对从国库中提取新的巨额的借款出去。因此，决不能认为“马歇尔计划”（首先是为美国独占资本经济和对外政治利益服务的）的实现，已经有了任何保证。从最近美国经济统计数字看来，上述这些便是在讨论“马歇尔计划”时所应该记取和考虑的一些问题。
