"Book and Newspaper Support" Inspires the Front Lines
    Various Units Send Letters of Thanks

    [This Newspaper's Report] As of now, the New Masses Society's "Book and Newspaper Support" campaign has distributed over 50,000 books. Comrades from various units have written to the society, requesting that their gratitude be conveyed to the people in the rear. A letter from a certain unit at the front read: "Comrades of the New Masses Society: ... In each page of the 'Book and Newspaper Support' special section, there is a wealth of power, which gives us courage. It shows us that the fighting at the front is not lonely, and this makes the feelings between us and our fellow countrymen in the rear more closely united, converging into a huge torrent to defeat the reactionaries." Chief of Staff Lü of the Yang Independent Battalion wrote: "When the New Masses Society sent a large number of books to support the army to Shouyang camp, everyone scrambled to read them. Even the supply officer took a book with him to the division and read it on the way. He was extremely interested. He said, 'Heroes of Lüliang' made people laugh to death, and 'Officials Force the People to Revolt' made people cry to death. All are good books, and you can't get tired of reading them even several times." Liu Sanhuo, a hero in killing enemies from the Shouyang Independent Battalion, often read the various books sent by the New Masses Society to his squad. The soldiers felt very energetic when fighting after listening to the books, and asked to read them immediately after a battle. Comrade Yan Zhizhong from the headquarters of the 7th Brigade of the 3rd Column wrote: "Everyone loves the books and newspapers sent by the New Masses to the front lines. Every time we rest during marching, everyone gathers around them!" (Bookstore Correspondence Group, Mao)

　　“书报劳军”鼓舞前线
    各部队纷函答谢
    【本报讯】新大众社的“书报劳军”，截至现在，已发了五万余册书，各部队同志都纷纷致函该社，要求把他们的谢意转告后方人民。前方某部队来信这样的写道：“新大众社同志：……在那一页页‘书报劳军’专页的字里行间，蕴藏着一种丰富的力量，这种力量给我们的是勇敢。说明前方作战不是孤单的，这使我们和后方同胞之间的感情更密切地结合在一起，汇成了一支巨大的洪流，打垮反动派。”阳独立营吕科长来信说：“新大众社大批劳军书发到寿阳营，大家都抢着看，供给员到分区算，也带着书在路上看，兴趣高极了，他说：‘吕梁英雄传’把人笑死了，‘官逼民反’把人哭死。全是好书，看几遍也看不厌。”寿阳独立营杀敌英雄刘三货，经常给他班念新大众社寄来的各种书，战士们听了打仗很有劲，一打完仗就要求读。三纵队七旅旅部阎志忠同志来信说：“劳军书报新大众寄到前线，谁也爱她，每次行军休息下她就被大家围着！”（书店通讯组、毛）
