    Visiting the Civil War Vanguard Song Ruike
    Wang Kuang
    On the 2nd, this reporter met Song Ruike, the captured commander of the Kuomintang's 66th Division, in a certain area on the front lines, during the Yangshanji battle. This was my second meeting with this signatory of the "Central China Truce Agreement," who was also the main figure who first tore up the agreement and faithfully carried out Chiang Kai-shek's encirclement of Central China. The first time was at the meeting in Hankou in April last year to discuss the Central China truce. At that time, he was wearing a brand-new American khaki military uniform. The golden shoulder and collar badges glittered with dazzling light, putting on a very mighty appearance. But the general in front of me was sitting cross-legged on the bed, stroking his knees, his face was sallow and haggard, and he no longer had the arrogant and domineering look of the past. "I never thought we would meet again here." I greeted him.
    He talked about this campaign, narrating the course of each small battle in a very orderly manner. He said, "You (referring to the People's Liberation Army) surrounded us too tightly, there was simply no way to escape. The fierce artillery fire made it impossible for us to raise our heads. Many shells fell in the house where I was staying, and just a little bit more"—he stretched out his hands to compare—"and everything would have been over." Judging from the nervous expression on his face when he spoke, it is not difficult to imagine that this general still has lingering fears in his heart.
    After a pause, he said, "If we hadn't been holding on to the mentality of 'holding out for reinforcements,' we would have stopped fighting long ago, but what about the reinforcements? It was just an empty promise." He then went on to accuse Wang Jingjiu of incompetent command. Then, talking about the fate of the 66th Division, he said, "We were originally stationed in the Xinyang and Guangshui area of the southern section of the Pinghan Railway. After being reorganized last year, we went to western Henan at the end of June to 'suppress' the Central China Liberated Area. In March of this year, we were transferred to Zhengzhou. In the battle in northern Henan in April, we were almost wiped out by you (referring to the People's Liberation Army). Unexpectedly, less than three months later, in this battle of Yangshanji, we were finished like this." I calculated for him that it was exactly one year and one month. He suddenly said with emotion, "Yes, it's been more than a year. The changes in the past year have been so great. If the two sides hadn't fought, maybe..." He suddenly stopped, lost in bitterness. "But you fired the first shot in the Central China war." I couldn't help but remind him, and pointed out to him the sinful fact that the 66th Division had begun to violate the agreement and attack and kill in the Central China Liberated Area last year. "That's all in the past. We fired the first shot between Huayuan and Guangshui... Looking back, this is naturally..." He lowered his head weakly, his feet hanging down, gently tapping the edge of the bed, unwilling to say any more. (Xinhua News Agency, Jiluyu Front, 8th)

    访内战先锋宋瑞珂
    王匡
    二日记者于前线某地，会见在羊山集战斗中被俘蒋军六六师师长宋瑞珂。我与这个“中原停战协定”签字人，同时又是首先撕毁该次协定而忠实执行蒋介石围攻中原的主角已是第二次见面了。第一次就是去年四月间在汉口商谈中原停战问题的会议上。那时他穿着簇新的美国毕机军服。金黄色的肩领章，闪耀着眩目光彩，装出十分威武的架子。可是眼前这位将军，却在床上盘腿抚膝而坐，面容苍黄憔悴，再无过去那种傲慢与骄横的神态了。“真想不到在这里又会面了”。我对他打了个招呼。
    他谈起这次战役，很有顺序的叙述着各个微小战斗经过，他说：“你们（指解放军）包围的太紧了，简直是无路可走。炮火猛烈使我们抬不起头来，我住的房子里也落了好些炮弹，只差这么一点——他伸开两手比了比——就一切都完了。”看他说话时的紧张神色，不难想象这位将军，内心至今犹有余悸。
    停了一下他又说：“如果不是抱着‘固守待援’的心理，早就不打了，可是援兵呢？不过是一纸空文。”他随之就指责起王敬久的指挥无能来。接着谈到六六师的命运，他说：“我们原驻平汉南段信阳、广水一带，去年整编后六月底到了路西‘追剿’中原解放军，今年三月间调到郑州，四月间豫北一役，险些被你们（指解放军）歼灭。想不到未及三个月，这次羊山集之役，我们就这样的完了。”我给他计算了一下，这期间恰恰是一年零一个月，他忽然感慨的说：“是的，一年多了，这一年来变化真大，如果双方不打起来呢，说不定………”他恍然苦失的停住了。“但是中原战争就是你开了第一枪。”我不能不提醒他，而且给他指出：六六师去年开始违约攻击与捕杀中原解放区的罪恶事实。“这已经是过去的事了，我们在花园广水之间先打响了，………回忆起来这自然是………”他无力的低下了头，两脚垂下去，轻轻敲着床沿，再不愿说下去了。（新华社冀鲁豫前线八日电）
