In its letter to Chiang Kai-shek, the Federation demanded that the Chiang government lodge a serious protest with the U.S. government regarding the recent crimes of U.S. troops in Nanjing, Tianjin, Qingdao, and other cities, and the U.S. Navy's overturning of the original sentence of fifteen years in prison and declaring the rapist Pierson innocent and released. The Student Federation also firmly demanded that the Chiang government abolish U.S. military extraterritoriality, so that criminals should be judged by Chinese courts of law.

According to newspaper reports: Students in Tianjin, Qingdao, and other cities in North China unanimously support the demands of the National Student Federation, and also demand that the Chiang government release the student leaders and professors arrested in June.
