　　Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 13th. TASS, Moscow, 10th: Pravda international commentator Viktorov published an article commenting on the attitude of the Chiang Kai-shek government and its Central Daily News regarding the Japanese peace treaty issue, stating: "Judging from the reports of the Central Daily News, the Chiang Kai-shek government has already accepted the US proposal (note: that is, the decision to participate in the preparatory meeting for the Japanese peace treaty to be held in the United States, decided unilaterally by the United States and attended by eleven countries). For some reason, the content of the Chinese (Chiang) government's reply remains secret. Obviously, the current Chinese (Chiang) government believes that making the reply public to the broad masses of the Chinese people would be detrimental to itself. However, the opinions expressed by the Central Daily News reveal quite a bit about China's attitude towards the Japanese peace treaty. While emphasizing that China needs to have its own 'vigorous policy', the newspaper has to admit that the current Chinese rulers precisely lack such a policy that conforms to the interests of the Chinese people and the nation. The newspaper knows that replacing the unanimous voting procedure with a two-thirds majority vote cannot safeguard the interests of the Chinese people, but it is unwilling to openly criticize this procedure, and instead puts forward its own 'suggestions', aimed at winning the favor of its American masters and thereby enhancing its own position. The newspaper states: 'We suggest that in the conference on the Japanese peace treaty issue, the veto power of the four powers must not be abused. To this end, it is necessary to change the veto power from absolute to relative. Any one of the four powers can veto any proposal, but if the motion has two-thirds of the votes of the eleven countries present (including three of the four powers), then the motion is established and the veto power of one country is invalid.' This suggestion looks clever at first glance, but in fact, its proposal is an attempt to cover up a rather clumsy trick. The essence of this 'suggestion' is also 'manipulating votes'. The only difference is that this 'suggestion' gives the Chinese (Chiang) government more opportunities to use tricks with the participation of certain powerful countries. Obviously, the voting procedure proposed by the Central Daily News is a violation of the principle of unanimity among the four powers, and this position cannot be considered to be in line with world peace and the interests of the Chinese people."

　　对日和约问题蒋党邀宠美国
  　苏真理报著文谴责
    斥其所提表决程序违背世界和平
    【新华社陕北十三日电】塔斯社莫斯科十日讯：真理报国际评论家维克托罗夫著文评论蒋介石政府及其中央日报对于对日和约问题态度称：“由中央日报的报导判断，蒋介石政府已经接受了美国的建议（按：即决定参加由美国单独决定在美召开由十一国参加的对日和约预备会议），中国（蒋）政府的复文为了某种理由，内容仍然保持秘密，显然的现时中国（蒋）政府认为将复文公之于中国广大人民面前，对他自己是不利的。但是中央日报表示的意见，却相当透露了中国对日和约的态度。该报在强调中国需要有自己的“有力政策”时，不得不承认现在的中国统治者却恰恰缺乏这种符合中国人民及民族利益的政策。该报明知以三分之二多数通过来代替一致通过的表决程序，是不能维护中国人民利益的，但是却不愿公开指摘这种程序，而提出自己的“建议”，旨在赢得美国主人的宠爱而又借此提高自己的地位。该报称：“我们建议在对日和约问题的会议上，四强否决权必须不被滥用。为此目的，将否决权由绝对变为相对是必要的，四强中任何一国均可否决任何建议，但议案如有出席十一国家三分之二（包括四强中之三国）票数，则议案成立而一国的否决权无效。”这一建议粗看起来是巧妙的，其实他的提出来是企图掩饰相当不巧妙的诡计。这种“建议”，其本质同样是“玩弄票数”，唯一不同之处，就是这种“建议”，给中国（蒋）政府保证了更多的机会，在某些强国参与之下行使诡计。显然的，中央日报所提出的表决程序是破坏四强一致的原则的，这种立场不能认为是符合世界和平与中国人民利益的立场。”
