Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 10th. According to a Guangzhou dispatch from the Chiang Kai-shek Central News Agency on the 5th, the Yuehan Railway under the Chiang Kai-shek clique's rule has suffered a train derailment tragedy in Yingde due to corruption and mismanagement, resulting in over 300 casualties. The railway suffered damage during the war. After the Japanese surrendered, the Chiang government, in urgent need of transporting its civil war troops, disregarded the people's safety and prioritized "getting it running first, then making it fully ready," setting deadlines for repairs. This further increased the opportunities for Chiang Kai-shek clique officials to be negligent, cut corners, and profit from it. The railway is 1,090 kilometers long, with over 200 bridges of varying sizes. Only a dozen or so have been repaired, with the rest being makeshift wooden bridges with no safety guarantees. The sleepers are uneven, and the rails are of over 200 different types, many not meeting regulations. The train wheels include those used by the U.S. military during World War I. Although the "Jeme Tien Yow coupler" was invented in China, the railway uses very few of them in its cars, and the railway bureau considers uncoupling to be unremarkable. Since the railway reopened in July last year, it has been fraught with danger, and tragedy could occur at any time, causing passengers to be anxious. The Yingde tragedy is just one of the larger examples. After the tragedy, the Chiang-controlled railway bureau blamed the incident on the "insufficient experience of the flagman in the southern section of the bridge" and concealed the number of deaths and injuries as 94 to cover up the corruption of Chiang Kai-shek's rule.

Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 9th. A major grain fraud case recently occurred in the Chiang-controlled areas. According to the Qingdao "Military-Civilian Daily," the Chiang Kai-shek grain department recently used the pretext of "regulating people's food and suppressing rising prices" to sell military flour seized from the people at a price of 35,500 Chiang Kai-shek currency per bag to monopolistic companies such as the Central Trust Bureau for distribution in various places. Taking Qingdao City as an example, the city has already received 2,000 tons of flour, a total of 80,000 bags, from the Central Trust Bureau. The cost per bag, including freight, is at most 90,000 yuan, but the distribution price is 85% of the market price of 190,000 yuan per bag, which is 161,000 yuan per bag, with a profit of at least 60,000 yuan per bag. Furthermore, the company embezzled 3,200 bags of this 2,000 tons of flour under the pretext of losses during loading and unloading, earning 608 million yuan based on the market price. The total amount of corruption in these two items is 5.216 billion yuan.

　　蒋家官僚经营腐败
  　粤汉路发生翻车惨案
    【新华社陕北十日电】据蒋家中央社五日广州电透露：蒋家统治下的粤汉路，由于经营腐败，近发生英德堕车惨案，死伤乘客竟达三百余人之多。该路在战时遭受破坏，日寇投降后，蒋政府为使其内战军运急需。不顾人民生命安全，“先求其通，后求其备”，限期修复，更增加了蒋家官僚敷衍塞责偷工减料从中渔利的机会。该路计长一千零九十公里，共有大小桥梁二百余座，修复者仅十余处，余均为毫无安全可言之木便桥；枕木则参差不一，钢轨种类达二百余种，多不合规定；列车钢轮，尚有第一次大战时美军用者；“詹天佑钩”虽为我国所发明，但该路各车采用甚少，路局对脱钩之事，已看作不足为奇。该路自去年七月间通车后，即已危机四伏，随时可能发生惨剧，乘客莫不惴惴不安；英德惨案仅其中较大一例而已。该惨案发生后，蒋记路局将事件归罪于“桥南段打旗夫经验之不足”，并把死伤人数掩饰为九四人，以图掩饰蒋介石统治之腐败。
    【新华社陕北九日电】蒋管区近发生粮食大舞弊案。据青岛“军民日报”透露，蒋粮食部近借“调剂民食抑平涨风”为词，将自人民无代价搜刮来的军用面粉，以蒋币三万五千五百元一袋，让售于中央信托局等垄断公司，运往各地配售，单以青岛市而论，该市已由中央信托局运到一项面粉二千吨共八万袋，每袋成本连运费在内，最多不过九万元，但配售价格却是以市价每袋十九万元打八五折，即十六万一千余元，每袋至少获利六万元。又此二千吨面粉在装卸之际竟被该公司借口损失，私吞三千二百袋，按市价计算，白赚六亿零八百万元。两项共贪污五十二亿一千六百余万元。
