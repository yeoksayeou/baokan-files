Xinhua News Agency, Northeast, 19th—Since its establishment on "August 15th" last year, the Northeast Democratic Youth League now has 4,000 members and has become a mass organization of outstanding young people in the Northeast Liberated Areas. The members are distributed in the front lines, the rear, schools, factories, and hospitals, actively engaged in various practical activities. Last year, in August and September, they participated in the work of repatriating Japanese nationals and played an active role in the movement to support students in the KMT-controlled areas in protesting against the atrocities of American soldiers. This year, in January, college and middle school students in Harbin went to the countryside three times to assist the masses in land reform, and recently, 500 students from Nenjiang Province rushed to the newly recovered areas to help the masses carry out land reform. Members of the Democratic Youth League played a leading and backbone role in all of these activities. The Frontline Work Team organized by the Harbin Democratic Youth League is engaged in rescue, transportation, and various cultural and recreational activities on the front lines, greatly boosting the morale of the front. The bravery, enthusiasm, and active work style of the members have made the "Democratic Youth League" increasingly prestigious among young people in the Northeast Liberated Areas. In the past year, the number of members has rapidly increased from more than 170 to more than 20 times that number. The Harbin Democratic Youth League headquarters directly manages 13 branches, and there are 24 other branches in Jiamusi, Mudanjiang, and other places. The organization has spread throughout the Northeast Liberated Areas, and the composition of members has expanded from students to workers, shop assistants, clerks, and farmers.

　　东北民主青年联盟发展迅速威信日高
    【新华社东北十九日电】东北民主青年联盟自去年“八一五”成立一年以来，现已拥有四千盟员，成为东北解放区广大优秀青年的群众性组织。盟员分布前线、后方、学校、工厂、医院积极从事各种实际活动，去年八、九月间曾参加遣送日侨工作，在声援蒋区学生抗议美军暴行运动中也起了积极的作用。今年一月，哈市大中学生先后三次深入农村，以及最近嫩江省五百余学生奔赴新收复区帮助群众进行土地改革，民青盟员皆起了领导与骨干的作用。哈市民青所组织的前线工作团，在火线上从事于救护运输及各种文化娱乐活动，给前方士气以极大的鼓舞。盟员们勇敢、热情和积极工作的作风，已使“民青”在东北解放区青年中威信日高，一年来盟员由一百七十余人迅速发展至二十倍以上，哈市民青总部直属十三个支部，另有佳木斯、牡丹江等二十四个支部。组织普及全东北解放区，盟员成份亦由学生扩展至工人、店员、职员和农民。
