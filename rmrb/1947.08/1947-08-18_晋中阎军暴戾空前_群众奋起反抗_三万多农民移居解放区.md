Xinhua News Agency, Jin Sui, 16th: The fertile plains of central Shanxi, under the trampling of Yan's army, have become a living hell with corpses exposed in the wilderness. The broad masses of peasants there have angrily risen up, cooperating with the People's Liberation Army in a heroic and moving struggle against Yan's puppet regime. The central Shanxi plains, including the area south of Taiyuan, north of Lingshi, east of Fenyang, and west of Tongpu, have been the site of large-scale looting, arson, and murder by 27 regiments of Yan's army since June. Yan's army's slogans were: "Better to let ten common people starve to death than to let one soldier starve," and "One grain of wheat, one bullet." In the area around Xiaqu Town, Fenyang, alone, the 216th Regiment of the 72nd Division killed 100 residents, injured 2,000, abducted 3,000 young adults and "hostages," and looted countless amounts of property, livestock, and grain. When the regiment looted Xiaqu Town, even twelve-year-old girls and fifty-year-old women were raped. Men who hid in wheat fields were machine-gunned or stabbed to death with bayonets. Jigu Village was set on fire, and Yan's soldiers held women up to the fire for amusement. Those who refused to be defiled were thrown into the fire and burned alive. However, these atrocities further aroused the anger of the local masses, who actively supported the People's Liberation Army. Under Yan's army's severe torture and interrogation, they firmly refused to reveal the situation of the guerrillas or the location of hidden grain. Yan's army nailed Zhang Desheng, a militiaman from Xiaqu Town, to the wall by his limbs, but he still replied, "I don't know." Qiu Ru@, the commander of the 216th Regiment, personally directed the beheading of six peasants in Yixing Town, Fenyang, but to no avail. About 30,000 peasants carried out a mass evacuation, moving to the liberated areas. On July 4, with the assistance of the broad masses, the People's Liberation Army finally captured Qiu Ru@ alive and completely wiped out the 216th Regiment. This victory gave the masses, eager for revenge, infinite encouragement. They demanded that Qiu Ru@ be handed over to them to be dealt with themselves and further assisted the People's Liberation Army in punishing their enemies.
   
Xinhua News Agency, Jin Sui, 16th: The people near Taiyuan, unable to bear the brutal rule of Yan Xishan, have recently launched continuous struggles against grain requisitioning and conscription. Initially, these were individual actions, such as poisoning the food of Yan's soldiers who were seizing grain, or fleeing with their families in secret. Later, they gradually developed into organized collective struggles. On the 16th of last month, a people's uprising broke out in Baiyatu Village, forty li northwest of Taiyuan. After confiscating all the property of Liu Guangniu, the loyal dog of the Yan bandits, the people, supporting the old and carrying the young, crossed the Fen River and fled into the Jin Sui Liberated Area. The masses of Quanshui Village also rose up last month. After arresting the Yan puppet village head, they went to the Liberated Area, organized combat and production teams, and returned home to seize the planting. Villages near Lin Village spontaneously organized militias to resist the rule of the Yan puppets. The above villages are all within the so-called hundred-li defense line northwest of Taiyuan.

　　晋中阎军暴戾空前
  　群众奋起反抗
  　三万多农民移居解放区
    【新华社晋绥十六日电】晋中物产丰饶的平川，在阎军蹂躏下已成了尸骨暴野的活地狱，该地广大农民已愤怒地站起，配合解放军与阎伪展开可歌可泣的斗争，晋中平川包括太原以南、灵石以北、汾阳以东、同蒲以西地区，从六月开始，就集中着阎军二十七个团，进行大规模抢劫烧杀，阎军口号是：“宁叫饿死十个老百姓，不叫饿死一个兵”，“一颗麦子一颗子弹”。仅七十二师二一六团在汾阳下曲镇周围十余村，即杀死居民一百人，杀伤二千人，抓走青壮年和“肉票”三千人，抢走财物、牲畜、粮食无法计算。该团在洗劫下曲镇时，连十二岁的女孩五十岁的老妇也均被轮奸，躲入麦田的男子则被机枪扫射，或刺刀刺杀。寄谷庄被纵火焚烧，阎军抱着妇女对火作乐，拒绝受污辱的被投入火中活活烧死。然而这些暴行更激起当地群众的愤怒，积极支持解放军。在阎军严刑逼供下，他们坚决拒绝说出游击队的情况和藏粮地点，阎军把下曲镇民兵张德胜四肢钉在墙上，但他还是答以“不知道”。二一六团团长邱如＠，在汾阳宜兴镇曾亲自指挥铡死六个农民，但也毫无效果。约有三万多农民实行大搬家，移居到解放区内。在七月四日解放军在广大群众的协助下终于活捉邱如＠，干净消灭了二一六团。这一胜利给急切复仇的群众无限的鼓舞，他们要求把邱如＠交给他们自己处理，并进一步协助解放军惩罚他们的仇人。
    【新华社晋绥十六日电】太原附近人民因不堪受阎锡山残暴统治，近连续发动抗粮抗丁斗争。开始仅为单个人的行动，如以毒药饭菜毒死抢粮阎军，或携家潜逃。后来逐渐发展成为组织的集体斗争。上月十六日太原西北四十里之白崖头村爆发人民起义，人民于没收阎贼忠实走狗闾长刘光牛全部财产后，扶老携幼渡过汾河逃入晋绥解放区。泉水村群众亦于上月起义，在逮捕阎伪闾长后，投奔解放区，并组织战斗生产队回家抢种。蔺村附近各村自动组织民兵反抗阎伪统治。以上村庄均在太原西北所谓百里防线以内。
