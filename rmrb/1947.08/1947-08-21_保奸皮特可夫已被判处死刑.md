Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 18th. Sofia dispatch: The Bulgarian Capital High Court sentenced the main culprit in the treasonous conspiracy case, former National Agrarian Union leader Petkov, to death by hanging on the 17th. Accomplices were sentenced to varying terms of imprisonment. The High Court accepted Petkov's appeal and began the trial on August 5th, ending on the 9th. The trial confirmed that Petkov secretly instigated the underground fascist organizations "Officers' League" and "Neutral Officers," attempting to collude with foreign countries to carry out armed rebellion and engage in espionage for foreign countries. Since the start of the trial, the American and British political representatives in Bulgaria requested to attend this trial as official observers, which was solemnly rejected by the Bulgarian government, but ordinary visitor passes were still issued to demonstrate the impartiality of the trial. The verdict stated that if Petkov and others are not satisfied with this judgment, they may appeal to the Supreme Court within two weeks. According to reports, the Sofia District Court had previously sentenced Petkov to twelve and a half years of imprisonment in June.

　　保奸皮特可夫已被判处死刑
    【新华社陕北十八日电】索菲亚讯：保加利亚首都高等法院，十七日判决叛国阴谋案主犯，前全国农民联盟领袖皮特可夫绞刑，从犯分处徒刑。高等法院受理皮氏之上诉于八月五日开始审判至九日结束。审判证实皮氏秘密策动地下法西斯组织“军官联盟”与“中立军官”，企图勾结外国，实行武装叛变，并为外国作间谍工作。自开审时起，美英驻保政治代表曾要求以官方观察家身分旁听此项审判，经保政府严正拒绝，但仍发给普通旁听证，以昭审判之大公无私。判决书声明如皮特可夫等不服此项判决，可于两周内向最高法院提起上诉。按索菲亚地方法院曾于六月间判处皮氏十二年半之徒刑。
