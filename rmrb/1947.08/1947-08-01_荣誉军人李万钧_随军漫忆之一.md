    Honorary Soldier Li Wanjun
    Random Memories of Following the Army (Part 1)
    Wu Xiang
    The battle began. We captured an outer stronghold last night.
    A group of new recruits who had just arrived at the unit clamored to participate in this battle: "We came to fight Chiang Kai-shek, why won't you let us fight?" "If we never go into battle, won't we always be greenhorns?" "If we don't get some experience this time, won't the next time still be our first?" The leaders frowned and agreed. Who knew that these new recruits would be just as strong and composed as the veterans, and they completed their mission perfectly. I excitedly wrote a news item reporting their heroic spirit in their first battle. At this time, the battle was still continuing, the artillery fire was rumbling, and the stretcher bearers were braving low-flying Chiang Kai-shek planes strafing them to transport the wounded. I couldn't help but ask myself deeply: What makes the emancipated peasants of the liberated areas so selfless?
    I went to explore materials based on clues from various sources, and unintentionally discovered an honorary soldier who took the lead in joining the army. His name was Li Wanjun, and he was a platoon leader in the Replenishment Regiment. After the cadres of the Replenishment Regiment sent the new recruits to the units, they were originally supposed to return immediately to train another batch of new recruits, but later it was decided to stay and observe the battle, so as to improve training methods, and then return after the end of the campaign.
    But I looked and looked and couldn't find Li Wanjun; he had gone to the front-most trenches.
    At night, after midnight, I was rushing to write a manuscript. Someone pushed open the door and came in: "That comrade was looking for me, my name is Li Wanjun."
    Li Wanjun suddenly appeared before me like this. His clothes were stained with mud, his face was dark, his shoulders were broad, and his eyes were shining. In the light, he seemed capable and strong, not like a disabled honorary soldier. He sat down and began to talk to me.
    He was the son of a poor peasant in Licheng Licheng Village. He joined the Eighth Route Army as early as the winter of 1937. He successively served as a communication soldier, guard, and guard platoon leader in the 385th Brigade and the Jinnan Military Region. In the summer of 1940, his shoulder was shot through. At that time, the situation in Jinnan was still tense, so he went home to recuperate. Before his injury healed, he ran to the independent battalion in his county to work, leading a plainclothes team to conduct activities deep in the enemy-occupied areas, often sleeping in sorghum fields. In the winter of 1942, he was wounded and captured. The enemy dragged him into the city and tortured him cruelly, electrocuting him and pouring cold water on him. He lost consciousness several times but came back to life. He never revealed any secrets. He and two comrades were imprisoned in a small dark room, the bedside full of feces and urine, and straw replaced cotton bedding. For thirty-two days, they only ate sixty-six bowls of thin porridge with no rice visible. He was extremely weak due to excessive blood loss, hunger, and cold. But he still led his comrades in digging a tunnel to escape. He said, "Don't be sad, sadness is useless, show the spirit to overcome difficulties!" Their tools were only three pairs of chopsticks and a zither string. When digging, one person knelt on the ground, using a cotton coat to catch the loose soil, trembling and afraid to make a sound. When it was too difficult to dig, they urinated at the entrance of the hole, waiting for the soil to be soaked and loosened, and then used their hands to grab it out bit by bit. The guard patrolled the door, and at any time, he might suddenly pull open the small window for delivering meals and peek inside. Three times they were almost exposed, and he encouraged his companions, saying, "Don't be afraid, Communists have long entrusted their lives to the people." Finally, they secretly dug the hole. They chose a dark night, opened the outer opening of the hole, took off their cotton clothes, and crawled out. The enemy discovered them and chased after them, and they ran in three directions. He jumped off the city wall and fell into the moat, passing out. When he woke up, his clothes were frozen, piercingly cold. Fortunately, his head was still out of the water. He gritted his teeth and struggled forward. By this time, it was almost dawn and he could no longer move, so he hid in a ditch. He trembled all day long, and the area of frozen skin was very large, and the pain pierced his heart. With great difficulty, he waited until night before quietly sneaking to his sister's house in Gong Village. When his sister recognized him, she immediately hugged him and cried until she fainted, but he himself could not shed a single tear. Later, the enemy suddenly surrounded Licheng Village and captured his younger brother, threatening that as long as he did not work for the Eighth Route Army, they would release him. He firmly refused, and the enemy brutally killed his younger brother. In February 1945, his right arm was crippled. He couldn't even lift a gun at all, so he had to retire and return home.
    After the Japanese surrendered and Licheng County was liberated, a vigorous land reform was carried out. The masses divided eighteen acres of good land to Li Wanjun and exchanged him for a landlord's good house. He married a wife, supported his old mother, and was elected as the director of the district's honorary soldiers, living a comfortable and happy life amid the respect of the masses. From his own happiness, he experienced the happiness of the entire liberated area. He saw his own hard work, his own sweat and blood, and finally created such a proud liberated area!
    However, the traitor Chiang Kai-shek's attack came. So, he forgot that he was disabled and took the lead in signing up to join the army again, angrily picking up his gun again. When the village cadres tried to dissuade him, he shouted: "Is my left arm also crippled?! Isn't my right arm not crippled?!"
    His old mother, his beloved wife, his good land and good house, he put them all down without any reluctance. He wanted to fight to defend these! No! He was not only defending these, he was fighting to defend the entire liberated area! He knew best how much sweat and blood had created the liberated area, so his hatred for Chiang's bandit gang who invaded the liberated area was the most intense and profound!
    "You ask me why I hate Chiang Kai-shek so much? Good! I ask you, why shouldn't I hate Chiang Kai-shek? Why shouldn't I hate Chiang Kai-shek!" He roared and stood up, unable to say a word for a long time. He raised his arm, but the disability of that arm was even more obvious because he wanted to raise it high but couldn't.
    At this time, a clear burst of machine gun fire came from afar. It was the enemy hindering us from digging communication trenches.
    "The enemy is very cunning. They planted many landmines on the edge of the outer trench. I discovered them and helped the Seventh Company lead three new recruits to crawl over and remove them. If we dig the communication trench well tonight, we will ask these bastards to return to their hometowns tomorrow night." He cursed fiercely, his face as hard as a piece of iron. Only then did I realize why his clothes had so much mud on them. When this hero of the Anti-Japanese War, this disabled honorary soldier, bravely crawled forward under the enemy's machine gun blockade, and the three new recruits who were fighting for the first time also bravely crawled forward under the enemy's machine gun blockade, wasn't this a microcosm of the war of self-defense? Our thousands upon thousands of young and strong new soldiers have accepted the heroic tradition of twenty years of arduous struggle, and we will definitely completely eliminate Chiang's bandit gang and liberate all the people of China!

    荣誉军人李万钧
    随军漫忆之一
    吴象
    战役开始了，昨晚攻克了一个外围据点。
    刚到部队的一批新战士，嚷着非参加这次战斗不可：“我们就是为打老蒋来的，为什么不让我们打？”“一辈子不出马，还不是个小驹？”“这回不锻炼，下回还不是第一回？”首长们皱着眉头答应了。谁知道这些新战士竟和老战士同样的坚强沉着，任务完成的很完满。我兴奋的写了条新闻，报导他们初次作战中的英雄气概。此时战斗还在继续，炮声隆隆，担架队员正冒着低飞扫射的蒋机枪运伤号。我不禁深深的问我自己：是什么使解放区的翻身农民如此奋不顾身呢？
    我根据各方面的线索去探寻材料，无意中发现了一个带头参军的荣誉军人。他叫李万钧，是补充团的排长。补充团的干部把新战士送到部队之后，原来是马上要回去训练另一批新战士的，后来却又决定留下参观作战，从而改进训练方法，到战役结束时再回去。
    但是我找来找去没有找到李万钧，他到最前边战壕里去了。
    晚上，已经过半夜了，我正在赶写稿件。一个人推开门进来：“那个同志找我，我叫李万钧。”
    李万钧就这样突然的出现在我的面前了，他衣服上染有泥土，脸是黑黑的，肩膀是宽宽的眼睛，闪闪发亮。灯光之下，似乎精干而且强壮，不象是个残废的荣誉军人。他坐下来，开始和我谈话。
    他是临城里城村一个贫农的儿子，早在三七年冬天就参加了八路军。先后在三八五旅，冀南军区当通讯员、警卫员、警卫排长。四○年夏天他肩膀被打穿了，当时冀南环境还紧张，他便回家休养，没有等伤好又跑到本县独立营去工作，率领便衣队深入敌占区活动，经常在高粱地里露宿。四二年冬天，他负伤被俘，敌人把他拉到城里，酷刑拷打，过电，灌凉水，几次断了气又活过来，他始终没有吐露一点秘密。他同两位战友被囚在一间小黑屋里，床头满是粪尿，谷草代替棉被。三十二天只吃到六十六碗看不见米的稀饭。他因流血过多，挨饿受冻，体力异常衰弱。但他仍领导战友们挖洞逃跑。他说：“不要难过，难过是空的，拿出克服困难的精神来！”他们的工具只有三双筷子，一把壶弦。挖时一个人跪在地上，用棉衣接着散土，提心吊胆的不敢发出响声，挖不动了，就在洞口尿尿，等土浸湿松开，再用手去一把一把的抓出来。卫兵就在门口巡逻，说不定什么时候，会忽然把送饭的小窗户拉开向里窥探，有三次都几乎败露了，他又鼓励同伴们说：“不要怕，当共产党的早都把命交给老百姓了。”终于他们偷偷地把洞挖好了。选择了个黝黑的深夜，打开洞的外口，脱去棉衣，钻了出去。敌人发觉追赶，他们分三路跑，他从城墙上跳下去，跌到护城河里，昏过去了。醒来衣服已被冰冻住，尖寒澈骨。幸好头还在水外，他咬紧牙，挣扎着向前爬，此时天已快亮，不能再动，他便躲在一道凹沟里隐蔽起来。竟日周身颤抖不止，冻溃的皮肤面积很大，痛入心脾。好容易挨到晚上，才悄悄溜到珙村姊姊家里。姊姊认出原来是他时，立刻抱着他哭得昏了过去，而他自己，却已哭不出一点眼泪。后来，敌人突然包围了里城村，捕去他的弟弟，扬言只要他不干八路军，就可以释放，他坚决不答应，敌人竟把他弟弟残杀了。四五年二月，他右胳膊又被打残废了。根本不能举枪，这才不得不退伍回家。
    日寇投降，临城全县解放之后，进行了轰轰烈烈的土地改革。群众给李万钧分了十八亩好地，换了一座地主的好房子。他娶了个妻子，供养着老母亲，并被选为区的荣誉军人主任，在群众的尊敬之中过着舒适幸福的生活。他从自己的幸福中体验到整个解放区人民的幸福，他看到自己艰辛的努力自己的热汗和鲜血，终于缔造了这么个值得骄傲的解放区！
    然而，卖国贼蒋介石进攻来了。于是，他忘记自己是个残废，又带头报名参军，愤怒地再拿起枪来。村干部劝阻他时，他大叫大闹：“我左胳膊也残废了吗？！我右胳膊并没有残废呀？！”
    他的老母，他的娇妻，他的好地好房子，他都毫无留恋地放下了，他要为保卫这些而战！不！他不仅是保卫这些，他要为保卫整个解放区而战！他最知道解放区是多少汗多少血缔造成的，因此他对进攻解放区的蒋贼的仇恨最强烈最深刻！
    “你问我为什么这样恨老蒋？好！我问你，我为什么不恨老蒋？我为什么不恨老蒋！”他吼叫着站起来，久久说不出一句话。他抬了抬胳膊，但是那胳膊的残废，却因想高举又举不起来而更显露了。
    这时，远处传来一阵清晰的机枪声，那是敌人在阻扰我们挖交通壕。
    “敌人鬼得很，外壕边埋了许多地雷，我发现了，帮七连带了三个新战士爬过去都拔了。今晚挖好交通壕，明晚就要请这些忘八蛋回老家。”他狠狠的骂着，面孔板得同铁块一样。我这才知道他衣服上何以有这么多的泥土。当这位抗日的英雄，这位残废的荣誉军人英勇地在敌人机枪封锁下向前爬去，后面三个初次作战的新战士，也英勇地在敌人机枪封锁下面向前爬去的时候，不正是一幅自卫战争的缩影吗？我们千千万万年青健壮的新战士已经接受了二十年艰苦战斗的英雄传统，我们一定能彻底消灭蒋贼，解放全中国的人民！
