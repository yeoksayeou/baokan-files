Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, August 11th: Comprehensive reports indicate that Uncle Sam, regarding the issue of raising Germany's industrial level, is treating Britain and France as if they were housekeepers, with the attitude of an owner. The result has been a disheartened France and an angered Britain. Informed sources in Paris revealed on the 7th: "The French government is not entirely satisfied with the procedure suggested by the United States, namely that France can only simply raise objections to the issue of raising Germany's industrial level," and demands "prior participation in discussions." On the 9th, a British Foreign Office spokesman said loudly: "The British government believes that the statement that 'the issue of Germany's industrial level is only related to Britain and the United States, and there is no need for France to participate in consultations' is 'anti-French and anti-British propaganda'." And stated: "When Britain and the United States hold meetings on the German industrial level issue, they should not only consult with France, but France should also participate in the talks." It is widely believed that this statement by the British authorities, aimed at winning over France to enhance its position in negotiations with the United States, indicates that Britain is becoming impatient with Marshall's attempt to force Britain to accept his dominant plan in the Anglo-American German issue talks (the meeting is scheduled to be held on the 12th according to the State Department announcement). After Britain issued this statement, the U.S. State Department immediately sent a note to France on the same day stating: "The U.S. government is prepared to agree to convene a three-country meeting so that French views can be considered, and to facilitate the study and explanation of the objectives of the plan before the U.S. and Britain finally draft and adopt it." Although the note made some superficial concessions, its attitude of despising France's status was still evident on paper. According to a French News Agency report from Washington on the 9th, diplomatic circles in Washington stated: The above-mentioned U.S. note "is a reminder to France that it has no sovereignty over the British and American occupation zones, and should consider the U.S.'s agreement to its request for a meeting as the greatest concession that the U.S. government is currently prepared to make." So far, the French side has not made any formal response to this note. However, people in Paris are wary of the deceptive U.S. authorities, as they are deeply impressed by the following facts: Marshall once wrote to Bidault, clearly stating in the French translation that France could participate in Anglo-American talks on the issue of raising Germany's industrial level; however, U.S. Secretary of the Army Royal stated one day that there was no U.S.-French agreement that France could participate in discussions on the German issue. And when Marshall answered this question at a press conference on the 6th, according to the French News Agency, he "never made any clear statement regarding France's participation in the final talks on German production," only stating that he would "thoroughly review this issue."

Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, August 11th: TASS Moscow dispatch: The International Observer of the News Bulletin recently commented on France's anxiety about the Marshall Plan, stating: France knows today that the United States wants to sacrifice France's political and economic interests to turn West Germany into a U.S. expansionist fortress in Europe. In order to increase the output of the West German steel industry, the United States not only needs to control the coal in the Ruhr, but also needs to control the iron ore in Lorraine in the French zone. The U.S.'s "financial aid" to France is actually to force France to reduce the development of its smelting industry and to give France Ruhr steel refined from French iron ore from Meurthe-et-Moselle. Regarding the fact that the French government has touted Marshall's permission for France to participate in consultations on the industrial level of West Germany as a "diplomatic victory," the observer pointed out: Now U.S. Secretary of the Army Royal has denied that the United States ever made this promise. This is equivalent to giving the U.S. imperialism's brokers in France "another spoonful of black tar." Many French newspapers believe that Royal's remarks are simply a slap in the face to France. French public opinion is increasingly worried about France's security. Because the restoration of Germany's industrial potential will actually nullify the results of the French people's three efforts against German militarism, and will bring great threats to France's peace and security. Even the rewards that the French brokers who are loyal to the interests of American monopolists receive from their masters are only contempt.

### 提高德国工业水平问题　美英法间斗争不已

　　提高德国工业水平问题
  　美英法间斗争不已
    【新华社陕北十一日电】综合报导：围绕德国工业水平之提高问题，山姆大叔俨然以主人对管家的态度对待英、法，其结果已使法国丧气，英国恼怒。七日巴黎消息灵通者透露：“法国政府并不完全满意于美国所建议的程序，即法国只能简单地对提高德国工业水平问题提出异议”，而要求“事先参加商讨”。九日英外交部发言人则大声地说：“英政府认为，所谓‘德国工业水平问题只与英美有关，而无须法国参加会商’的说法，是‘反法与反英的宣传’。”并表示：“在英美对德工业水平问题举行会议时，不仅应与法国协商，而法国亦应参加会谈。”众信，英国当局此种拉拢法国以增强其在与美国交涉中的地位的声明，表示英国已对马歇尔企图在英美格尔问题会谈（该会议据国务院宣布将于十二日召开）中强制英国接受其主宰计划一事感觉不耐。英国此一声明发出后，美国务院即于同日照会法国称：“美政府准备答应召开三国会议，以便能考虑法国观点，并便于在美英最后拟就且采行计划前，能研究并说明该计划之目标。”该照会虽作了某些表面的让步，但其藐视法国地位之态度仍跃然纸上。据法新社华府九日电，华府外交界人士称：上述美国照会“这是提醒法国，它对英美占领区是没有主权的，应认为美国答应其开会之要求，表示这是美国政府目前准备作的最大让步。”迄今法方对此照会尚无正式反应，然巴黎人士对善于摆设骗局的美国当局存有戒心，盖彼等对下列事实印象颇深：马歇尔曾致函比道尔，从法译文中明确表示关于提高德国工业水平问题，法国可以参加英美会谈；但美陆长罗雅尔一日则声称：并无法国可参与讨论德国问题的任何美法协议。而马歇尔在六日记者招待会上答复这个问题时，据法新社称，竟“一直没有发表关于法国参加德国生产最后会谈的任何清晰声明”，仅称：他将“彻底审查此问题”。
    【新华社陕北十一日电】塔斯社莫斯科讯：消息报国际观察家顷评论法国对马歇尔计划惶惶不安称：法国今天已经知道美国要牺牲法国的政治经济利益，来把德国西部变成美国在欧洲的扩张堡垒。为了提高德国西部制钢工业的产量，美国不仅需要控制鲁尔的煤，而且还需要控制法国区域中洛林的铁矿。美国对法的“金元援助”，原来就是迫使法国减缩其冶炼业的发展及给予法国由法国铁矿苗提炼出来的鲁尔钢而已。对于法政府目前曾把马歇尔允许法国参加关于德国西部工业水平的会商自诩为“外交胜利”一事，观察家指出：现在美国陆军部长罗雅尔却否认美国曾经作过这个许诺。这等于又给美帝国主义在法国的掮客们吃上“另一匙黑焦油”。法国的报纸，很多都认为罗雅尔的这种言论，简直就是给法国一个耳光。法国舆论愈来愈对法国的安全表示忧虑。因为德国工业潜力的恢复，实际上将使法国人民三次反德国军国主义战争努力之果实化为乌有，并且给法国和平与安全带来莫大的威胁。即使那些对美国垄断家利益忠心耿耿的法国掮客所得到主子的报酬，也不过是轻蔑。
