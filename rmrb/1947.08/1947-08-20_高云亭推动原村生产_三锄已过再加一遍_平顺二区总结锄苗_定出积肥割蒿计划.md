　　[This newspaper, Taiyue, 18th dispatch] Tunnliu's double hero Gao Yunting Village—Yuancun, summarized its production and support for the front lines work in the first half of the year on July 29th. Both aspects exceeded the task. In production, the combination of agriculture and sideline occupations was implemented. In agriculture, in addition to timely sowing, most of the autumn crops were weeded three times. The harvest of wheat was 430 shi, with an average of 1.9 dou of wheat per household, and a yield of more than 5 dou per mu. The wheat fields have now been plowed once. In sideline production, a total of 1,969 bolts of cloth were woven, with more than 8 bolts per household, all exceeding the original plan (7.5 bolts). In transportation, the whole village earned more than 3.2 million yuan, and Gao Yunting's household earned 150,000 yuan. Therefore, the whole village increased the purchase of 13 donkeys and horses, expanding the transportation capacity. Pig and chicken farming has also greatly developed, with a total of 441 pigs raised, reaching an average of two per household, more than doubling the original plan. Chicken farming has reached an average of more than one per person. In supporting the front lines, the "combination of support for the front and production" was implemented. Military shoes, military cloth, and transportation of military supplies were all completed on time, and were commended by the county government. The rotation warfare team and the civilian laborers participating in the war not only arrived on time for each departure, but also never experienced any escape phenomenon. Now, in addition to the double heroes Gao Yunting, Farmers' Association Chairman Gao Yuting, and Village Head Zhang Renyi, Vice Chairman Liu Baocai, Military Committee Director Jia Longyuan, and Women's Association Chang Lu Shi Lingui have also become model cadres loved by the masses. This is one of the main reasons for the village's success. Now, in order to increase production, the village has decided to weed the autumn crops again (four times), plant more vegetables, improve textile production, develop transportation and martial arts, and continue to carry out the production and support the front lines merit campaign.
　　[This newspaper reported] Niuling, Ping Shun third district, under the promotion of labor hero Zhang Jianfu and production technology expert Wang Dongping, launched a surprise attack on weeding. Wang Dongping promoted to the groups in the village and said: This year's seedlings were planted too late due to the drought. If we weed several times more, we will definitely not harvest less grain. In this way, he repeatedly mobilized everyone to weed more seedlings. He first weeded his cotton six times, and his millet three times, and plans to weed again. Under his influence, the whole village has achieved deep plowing and meticulous cultivation. Production inspection found that cotton had been weeded nine times.

　　[This newspaper Ping Shun News] The second district, combined with this county-wide weeding general inspection, made a summary of weeding in the whole area, and conducted mass elections, comparing achievements, establishing merit lists, blackboard newspapers, and loudspeakers to commend the production models. A total of 246 various heroes and models such as Li Shunda were elected, and 19 model mutual aid groups were established. It was also found that 218 of the 467 mutual aid groups were not working, and some were said to be colluding groups, or filling out forms groups. After commending the models and praising the merits, the masses' emotions were even higher. Xi Gou Lao Hei said: This time, the credit cannot be concealed. Under the leadership of heroes and models, all villages have set out plans for accumulating fertilizer and cutting reeds. Hero Li Shunda said: Our group guarantees that each laborer will cut 60 bundles of reeds. And set out merit conditions, one merit for cutting twenty bundles of reeds. Now all villages have set out plans for accumulating fertilizer and cutting reeds. (Shen Gang, Niu Xian, Weizhen, Qiuhong)

　　高云亭推动原村生产
  　三锄已过再加一遍
    平顺二区总结锄苗
  　定出积肥割蒿计划
    【本报太岳十八日电】屯留双英雄高云亭村——原村，于七月二十九日总结前半年生产与支援前线工作，两方面均超过了任务。在生产上，实行农副业结合，农业方面，除按时下种外，秋禾大部锄过三遍。收麦子四三○石，每户平均收麦一石九斗，每亩产量在五斗以上。麦地头遍现已犁过。副业生产，共织布一九六九匹，每户织到八匹多，均超过原计划（七匹半）。运输上全村共赚洋三百二十余万元，高云亭一户赚洋十五万元。因此全村增购了驴马十三头，扩大了运输力。养猪与养鸡亦有很大发展，共养猪四四一口，已达到每户平均二口，超过原计划的一倍。养鸡作到每人平均一只以上。在支援前线上，实行了“支前与生产结合”，军鞋军布屯及运输军火都按期完成任务，并得到县府表扬。轮战队和参战民夫不仅作到每次按时出发，而且从来没发生过逃跑现象。现在该村除双英雄高云亭、农会主席高玉亭、村长张仁义外，副主席刘保才、武委会主任贾龙元、妇会常陆史林桂等，也均成为群众所爱戴的模范干部，这是该村获得成绩的主要原因之一。现该村为了增加生产，确定秋禾再锄一遍（四遍），多种蔬菜，提高纺织，发展运输与练武，继续开展生产支援前线立功运动。
    【本报讯】平顺三区牛岭在劳动英雄张建伏和生产技术能手王东平推动下突击锄苗。王东平在村对各组宣传说：今年的小苗因天旱种的太晚，咱们如果要多锄几遍，就一定不会少打粮。他就这样再三动员大家多锄苗，他自己首先把他的棉花锄了六遍，谷锄了三遍，还计划再锄，在他的影响下全村都做到深耕细作。生产检查棉花有锄九遍的。（生产检查小报）
    【本报平顺讯】二区结合这次全县锄苗大检查，做出了全区的锄苗总结，对生产中的模范，进行了群众性的选举、比成绩、立功挂榜、黑板报啦叭等表扬。共选举出各种英雄模范李顺达等二四六名，模范互助小组十九个，也检查出四六七个互助小组中有二一八个不起作用，有说勾结组，填表组。经过表模表功群众情绪更高，西沟老黑说：这次真闷不了功劳。在英雄模范带头下，各村都纷纷订出积肥、割蒿计划，英雄李顺达说：我这个小组保证每劳力要割六十捆蒿。并订出立功条件，割二十捆蒿立一功。现各村都已经订出积肥割蒿计划。（申刚、牛贤、维珍、秋红）
