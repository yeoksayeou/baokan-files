　　Xiajin, Eight District, Gouwang Village
  　A Model in All Aspects of Work
    [Report from our Jinnan Correspondent] Gouwang Village, in the Eighth District of Xiajin County, has become a model in various aspects of work. It received district-level award banners for both joining the army and managing the river. Recently, the assessment of burdens was both quick and fair, and neither sandy land nor woodland was reported as wasteland. In the Great Production movement, the masses are very enthusiastic. Wang Mingtong, an old man in his forties or fifties, has four mu of alkaline land located on the west bank of the Majia River, half a li away from the river bend. He hauled soil from the river bend for half a month, finally covering the alkaline land completely. The cotton planted there is now growing even more vigorously than in good land. As the green crops rise, the militia are very active in preventing counterattacks by special agents and landlords, and are known as the eastern fortress of the Eighth District. Militia captain Yu Dexiang seizes every opportunity, whether at noon or at night, to take the militia to patrol the surrounding villages. The main reason why this village's work is doing well is that the village cadres consult with the masses on everything.

　　夏津八区苟王庄
  　各样工作是模范
    【本报冀南讯】夏津八区苟王庄各种工作起模范。参军治河均获区里奖旗。最近造负担，又快又公平，沙地和树林，也没报成荒地。大生产中，群众很带劲，四五十岁的老头王明同，四亩硷地，位于马夹河西岸，相距河套半里地，他从河套里的土捎了个半月，终于将硷地铺了一遍，种上棉花，现长的比好地还旺。青纱帐起，为防止特务地主反攻，民兵非常活跃，号称八区东部的堡垒，民兵队长于德祥，无论正午和夜间，有时间即抓紧民兵到周围村去查岗。这村工作搞得好的主要原因是村干部有啥事和群众商量的结果。
