　　Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 19th. The North China Student Federation recently sent a memorandum to Wedemeyer, pointing out that the US government should be held responsible for the outbreak and expansion of the Chinese civil war. According to a TASS dispatch from Nanjing on the 17th, the detailed content is as follows: "We welcome assistance from all friendly countries in establishing a new China that is democratic, unified, and peaceful; but we oppose any country interfering in China's internal affairs, and oppose any country directly or indirectly participating in China's civil war. Regrettably, your country's erroneous China policy has encouraged and continues to encourage the Chinese civil war, bringing all kinds of suffering to the Chinese people. We hope that Your Excellency and your government will pay attention to the following facts and immediately take measures to change them quickly: First, in the year since the victory over Japan, your country has provided the Kuomintang government with $4 billion in aid (including delivery of Lend-Lease materials and sales of war surplus materials) for use in conducting the civil war. This aid is greater than during the Anti-Japanese War. Second, your country equipped forty Kuomintang divisions in the ten months after the war against Japan, but during the Anti-Japanese War, it only equipped twenty divisions, and these twenty divisions were not actually used in combat against Japan. These measures taken by your country during China's rehabilitation and construction are intolerable to the Chinese people. Third, your country transported a large number of Kuomintang troops to the Northeast and North China to conduct civil war. Fourth, your country's troops directly participated in the Chinese civil war, such as occupying Qinhuangdao. Fifth, your country refuses the Chinese people's demand to withdraw the Qingdao fleet and the military advisory group stationed in Nanjing. Sixth, your country sold 130 million rounds of ammunition to the Kuomintang government in June of this year, which is tantamount to adding fuel to the fire of the Chinese civil war. Based on the above facts, your government should be held responsible for the current disasters of the Chinese people. We deeply regret your government's measures. Your country's measures violate the interests of the Chinese people and unilaterally promote the civil war, and promote actions that undermine China's peace and democracy. The North China Student Federation urgently requests that your country stop assisting the Kuomintang government and implement a policy that is conducive to Chinese democracy and the cessation of the civil war. We must emphasize that the Chinese question must be resolved by the Chinese people themselves. We highly value the friendship between the two great nations of China and the United States, and we hope that your government can follow the great spirit of democracy and freedom of the late President Roosevelt and immediately change its erroneous China policy, giving China the opportunity to embark on the road of democracy, freedom, peace, and unity."

　　华北学联致魏德迈备忘录
  　历数美助蒋内战罪行
    希望立即改变对华错误政策
    【新华社陕北十九日电】华北学联最近致魏德迈备忘录，指出美国政府应负使中国内战发生及扩大责任。兹据塔斯社南京十七日电，其详细内容如下：“我们欢迎一切友好的国家援助我们建立民主、统一与和平的新中国；但我们反对任何国家干涉中国内政，反对任何国家直接间接参与中国内战。令人遗憾的是贵国的错误对华政策，已经鼓励并继续鼓励中国内战，给中国人民带来各种苦难，我们希望阁下暨贵国政府注意下列事实，并立即采取措施迅予改变：第一，战胜日本后的一年来，贵国给予国民党政府以四十亿美元援助（包括交付租借物资及让售战争剩余物资）用以进行内战，这种援助较之抗日期间还大。第二，贵国在对日战争后的十个月内，装备了国民党四十个师，而在抗日期间，却不过装备二十个师，而此二十个师实际上亦未用于对日作战。贵国在中国复员与建设期间的此种措施，是中国人民不能容忍的。第三，贵国曾运输大量国民党军队至东北及华北进行内战。第四，贵国军队曾直接参加中国内战，例如占领秦皇岛。第五，贵国拒绝中国人民要求撤退青岛舰队及驻南京军事顾问团。第六，贵国在今年六月间售予国民党政府以一亿三千万发子弹，这等于对中国内战火上加油。基于上项事实，中国人民目前的灾难应由贵国政府负责。对贵国政府的措施，我们内心深表遗憾。贵国措施违反了中国人民的利益，片面地助长了内战的进行，助长了破坏中国和平与民主措施的行动。华北学联迫切要求贵国停止援助国民党政府，实行有利于中国民主与停止内战的政策。我们必须强调指出，中国问题是必须由中国人民自行解决。我们非常珍贵中美两大民族的友谊，更希望贵国政府能遵循故罗斯福总统伟大的民主自由精神，立即改变错误的对华政策，予中国以走上民主、自由、和平与统一大道的机会。
