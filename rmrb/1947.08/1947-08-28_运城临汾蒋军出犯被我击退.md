　　Xinhua News Agency, Jinji Luyu, 26th: The Taiyue People's Liberation Army routed Chiang Kai-shek troops invading from Yuncheng and Linfen. On the 17th, over 2,500 Chiang Kai-shek troops from Yuncheng, equipped with 12 mortars, launched an attack in three directions, attempting to retake Jie County. The defending People's Liberation Army calmly responded, first routing one of the invading forces advancing to the north of the city. The remaining two forces, hearing the news, collapsed and retreated. Simultaneously, on the northern front, the 30th Division of Chiang Kai-shek troops from Linfen also used the 80th Regiment of the 37th Brigade in conjunction with miscellaneous bandits to occupy Xiangling. Furthermore, the 90th Regiment of the 30th Brigade invaded Xia Hui and Zhang Li to the south. On the 19th and 20th, they continued to advance towards the area south of Zheng Zhuang, but were repelled by our local forces. On the 21st, they fled back to Linfen city. Initial battle results from both locations show a total of over 170 enemy soldiers annihilated, and over 40 American-style machine guns and some ammunition seized.
