Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 17th. The Chiang government has decided to intensify its exploitation of the people through so-called "strict economy" measures in an attempt to alleviate the predicament it faces in supplying its costly anti-popular civil war. According to a Central News Agency report, the Chiang Kai-shek government committee passed a "General Outline of Strict Economy Measures" at its meeting on the 15th. The "Outline" is divided into two parts. One part is directed at the general public in the Chiang-controlled areas, stipulating that people are "forbidden to produce first-class white rice and wheat flour." Like the Japanese invaders treated the Chinese people, it lists the people's consumption of high-quality rice and flour as "illegal" and restricts the food consumption of the people in the Chiang-controlled areas, who are already in a state of hunger, in order to facilitate their deprivation. It stipulates that ordinary merchants shall not engage in import trade outside the scope of the Chiang government's "import regulations," claiming that "items whose import is prohibited will be confiscated by the government if they are found on the market two months after the promulgation of this outline." The purpose of this provision is to create excuses for "legal" plunder of merchants and to control the import of certain American goods in the hands of family companies for "exclusive operation." The "Outline" also includes a conspiracy to further destroy private publishing businesses by using the means of "saving paper for newspapers, magazines, and books." The other part of the "Outline" directs its blade at the vast lower-level officers and soldiers in the Kuomintang military and political system, stipulating that "the number of employees in institutions should be limited" and that the tailoring of military and police uniforms must meet "the purpose of saving materials." This shows that a large number of non-confidant employees will be expelled from Kuomintang institutions or forcibly transferred to military service, and the lives of Kuomintang soldiers will become increasingly miserable. All of this shows that the Chiang family's small dynasty, in its dead end and utter embarrassment, is using all possible means of exploitation.
Xinhua News Agency, Jin Sui, 17th. Belated news: Yan Xishan recently implemented two measures in Taiyuan to further extort the people: "simplified life" and "civilian economy." It is said that the so-called "simplified life" means forcing people to eat third-class food (coarse grains), while Chiang and Yan soldiers eat first-class food, and civil servants eat second-class food. As for the content of "civilian economy," it is to forcibly control the four necessities of life: grain, salt, cloth, and wheat flour, and not allow people to freely buy and sell or transport them out of the city; if the government believes that the people's grain reserves exceed the prescribed amount, it can force "requisition and purchase." Under Yan's manipulation and robbery, more than half of the eighty-odd people in Taiyuan have been forced to close down because they cannot buy flour, and restaurants have also closed down one after another. Fines for violating the "civilian economy" are heard every day. Yan also said during his broadcast: "You have to listen to what I say, whether you want to or not. When you listen, 'leadership' comes your way, and when you don't listen, punishment comes your way."

　　战费浩繁财政窘迫蒋党疯狂搜刮人民
    【新华社陕北十七日电】蒋政府决定以所谓“厉行节约”的办法，加紧搜刮人民，图改善其反人民内战浩繁供应所遭遇之窘境。据中央社消息，蒋记国府委员会已于十五日会议中通过一“厉行节约办法纲要”。“纲要”分两部分，一部份系针对蒋管区一般人民而发，规定人民“禁造头号白米麦粉”，象日寇对待中国老百姓一样，将人民食用上等米面列为“违法”行为，并限制已陷于饥饿状态之蒋管区人民食量，以便利其剥夺；规定普通商人不得经营蒋政府“进口规章”范围外之进口贸易，声称“禁止入口之物品，于本纲要公布两个月后在市场上发见时，由政府加以没收”，此项规定目的在制造借口向商人进行“合法”掠夺，并将某些美货的进口掌握在家族公司“专营”手中。“纲要”且包含了一个以“节约报纸杂志及书籍使用纸张”手段，进一步毁灭民营出版事业的阴谋。“纲要”另一部分则将刀锋朝向国民党军政系统中的广大下层员兵，规定“限制机关员工数额”，军警制服之剪裁须符合“节省材料之目的。”这显示将有大量非亲信员工被逐出国民党机关或强迫转充兵役，国民党士兵的生活愈来愈苦。这一切都显示蒋家小皇朝在其穷途末路、窘态毕露中，搜刮手段已无所不用其极。
    【新华社晋绥十七日电】迟到消息：阎锡山近在太原实行进一步勒索人民的“简化生活”及“平民经济”两项措施。据称所谓“简化生活”即强迫人民吃三等饭（杂粮），而蒋阎军人则吃头等饭，公务员吃二等饭。至于“平民经济”之内容，即对粮食、食盐、布匹、麦粉四项生活必需品强行统制，不许人民自由买卖或运出城市；如官府认为民间存粮超过规定之数目时，可强迫“征购”。在阎贼此种操纵抢劫下，太原八十余所人多半数以上均因买不到面粉而被迫停业，饭食店也纷纷关门。因违反“平民经济”而被罚者日有所闻。阎贼并于其广播时称：“我的话听也得听，不听也得听，听时‘领导’上走，不听惩罚上走。”
