Xinhua News Agency, Frontline, Ji-Lu-Yu, 30th: Frontline reporter Fang De reports on the annihilation of Chiang Kai-shek's 66th Division, 199th Brigade as follows: After Chiang Kai-shek's 66th Division was surrounded by the People's Liberation Army (PLA) in Yangshanji, on the 15th, Wang Jingjiu ordered the 199th Brigade of the division, stationed in Jinxiang City, to cooperate with the 58th Division and a battalion of the 13th Artillery Regiment, along with the 3rd Tank Company, under the command of Lu Daoyuan, commander of the 58th Division, to reinforce Yangshanji. On the same day, this unit of Chiang Kai-shek's army advanced to Shijia Village, on the south bank of the Wanfu River, more than ten li north of Jinxiang, and was immediately blocked by a unit of the PLA. After eight days of fighting, it could not advance a single step. Lu Daoyuan then forced the 199th Brigade to attack Li Lou, five li in front of Shijia Village. A large part of the 595th Regiment of the brigade was first annihilated by the PLA. At 4:00 PM on the 22nd, Wang Jingjiu issued the final "death warrant," "ordering them to reach Yangshan that night by 12:00 PM, otherwise they would be dealt with by military law." Lu Daoyuan relayed this order to Wang Shiqiao, the brigade commander of the 199th Brigade, more than ten times by telephone, and each time he added, "If you don't arrive, the brigade commander will be shot first." At 6:00 PM, Wang Shiqiao said to his regimental officers on the bank of the Wanfu River, "They have their pockets open, waiting for us. It's obviously a gift-giving mission, and it's better to let me kill myself! With me here, you won't be able to step down. After I kill myself, you can easily find a way out." But he finally led the remnants of his troops across the river to their deaths. The PLA opened a gap to allow them to cross the Wanfu River smoothly, but when they reached Wanliuzhuang, five li south of Yangshan, they were no longer allowed to advance. A supervisory team from the 58th Division behind them realized something was wrong and immediately fled in panic. The PLA launched an encirclement and annihilation campaign against the besieged 199th Brigade that night. Chiang Kai-shek's troops were attacked from all sides, terrified and scattered, and their formation collapsed. In the chaos, four of the six battalion commanders were killed, one of the two regimental commanders was killed, and Brigade Commander Wang Shiqiao was wounded in the head. The officers and soldiers scurried around the encirclement like a flock of wild ducks. That night, the rain turned the roads into small rivers, and the Chiang Kai-shek officers and soldiers were covered in mud. Many soldiers surrendered with their guns without firing a single shot. On the morning of the 23rd, in the green gauze tents of the plains north of the Wanfu River, the PLA spread out a net to capture the scattered soldiers, who fell into the net like small fish. Brigade Commander Wang Shiqiao, who had fled alone, was captured in Tiantuan at 2:00 PM that afternoon. The 199th Brigade was thus completely annihilated overnight. Recalling the Battle of Junhua on April 18th this year, Song Ruihe, commander of the 66th Division, sacrificed the 2nd Rapid Column attached to his command in exchange for the 66th Division's opportunity to escape. This time, Lu Daoyuan of the 58th Division similarly used the 199th Brigade of the 66th Division as a price to save his own life this time.

    蒋军一九九旅被歼经过
    【新华社冀鲁豫前线卅日电】前线记者方德报导蒋军六十六师一九九旅被歼经过如下：蒋军六十六师被解放军围困在羊山集后，十五日王敬久命令留驻金乡城之该师一九九旅配合五十八师及炮兵十三团一个营战车第三连，由五十八师师长鲁道源指挥，向羊山集增援，该部蒋军当日进到金乡北十余里万福河南岸之石家店，即遭解放军一部阻击，经八天战斗不得前进一步，鲁道源遂迫令一九九旅向石家店正面五里之李楼进攻，该旅五九五团大部当首先被解放军歼灭。二十二日午后四时，王敬久下最后一道“催命符”，“限令即日晚十二时到达羊山，否则以军法从事”。鲁道源用电话把这道命令向一九九旅旅长王仕翘转达了十多次，并且每次都附加一句“不到就先枪毙旅长”。王仕翘傍晚六点钟在万福河岸上向他的团级军官说：“人家张好了口袋等着我们，明明是去送礼，还是让我自杀了吧！有我在你们就下不了台，我自杀以后，你们倒好找出路”，但他终于率领残兵败卒，过河送命来了。解放军放开一个口子，让他们都顺利的过了万福河，但进到羊山以南五里的万刘庄，就再也不让他前进一步了。五十八师在它后面的一个督战团，发觉不妙立即回窜，逃之夭夭。解放军当日夜向被围之一九九旅展开围歼。蒋军遭四周攻击，吓得五零四散，溃不成军。在混乱中，六个营长被打掉四个，两个团长被打死一个，旅长王仕翘头部负伤，军官士兵都像一群野鸭一样在包围网内乱窜。这天晚上，雨水把道路灌成小河，蒋军官兵们都滚成了泥蛋，许多士兵一弹未发，扛着枪来投降了。二十三日的早晨，在万福河以北一带平原的青纱帐里，解放军就撒开了捕捉网，像小鱼一样的散兵纷纷落网。只身逃跑的旅长王仕翘，就在这天午后两点钟于田屯被捉住。一九九旅就此在一夜间被全部歼灭了。回想今年四月十八日浚滑之战时，六十六师师长宋瑞河曾以牺牲配属他的第二快速纵队为代价而挣得六十六师的逃跑机会，这次五十八师鲁道源却也同样以六十六师一九九旅为代价，换取了自己这次的活命。
