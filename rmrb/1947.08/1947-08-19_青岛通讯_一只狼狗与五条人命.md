　　Qingdao Dispatch
  　A Wolfdog and Five Human Lives
    Chen Xiang
    On June 29th, Rear Admiral Kirk, commander of the US Western Pacific Fleet stationed in Qingdao, lost his beloved wolfdog, which caused him to furrow his brow in distress for several days. During these days, the lives of five Chinese compatriots were innocently and tragically ended by American bullets. The day after the wolfdog went missing, popsicle vendor Chen Luping was shot and killed by American devils for no reason. On the third and seventh days, Xiao Wang Desheng and three other Chinese compatriots lost their lives to the bullets of American imperialist sentries on trumped-up charges. They died unclearly. They were inexplicably murdered by American imperialists on their own soil.
    Admiral Kirk's low mood caused by the loss of his wolfdog was naturally a major event in the eyes of the Chiang Kai-shek officials, who were as anxious as if they had lost their parents. They racked their brains trying to figure out how to make their "dear" American master happy. So, when Admiral Kirk was lamenting the wolfdog's misfortune, they rushed to the US Naval Headquarters to offer their condolences in a sincere and fearful manner, and expressed that they would "do their utmost" to bring the wolfdog back to the master in the shortest possible time. Admiral Kirk gave 3,000 US dollars to Chiang Kai-shek's mayor, Li Xianliang, as a reward for finding the wolfdog, so Li immediately ordered all branch bureaus and police stations to send police to investigate. The Chiang Kai-shek's "Min Yan Daily" also automatically published a notice to find it.
    The peddlers Chen Luping and Wang Sheng died, and their families cried and wailed, unable to even afford a coffin. The other two innocent Chinese compatriots who were tragically killed lay stiff on the cold cement floor of the Municipal Hospital, and no one cared about them even as they rotted. Five human lives are ultimately not worth a wolfdog!

  　一只狼狗与五条人命
    陈湘
    六月二十九日，驻青岛的美西太平洋舰队总司令柯克二级上将心爱的一只狼狗失踪了，他为此困恼的紧蹙了好几天眉头。在这几天内，五个中国同胞的生命无辜的惨死在美军枪弹下。就在狼狗失踪的后一天，冰棍小贩陈禄平无故的被美国鬼子击毙，第三天及第七天，小王德胜以及另外三个中国同胞因莫须有的罪名，而先后丧命在美帝国主义哨兵的枪弹下。他们不明不白的死了。连他们自己也摸不着头脑的被美国帝国主义者惨杀在自己的国土上。
    柯克上将因失去狼狗所引起的心情低落，在蒋家官员们看来自然是一椿大事，他们急得如丧考妣似的，绞尽脑汁想如何来使他们“亲爱”的美国主人心情开朗。于是当柯克上将在叹息着狼狗不幸时，他们便赶到美海军司令部内，诚惶诚恐的慰问一番，并表示一定“竭尽微劳”在最短期内替主人把狼狗找回来。柯克上将把三千元美金交给蒋记市长李先良作为找获狼狗的奖金，于是李便立即通令各分局各派出所派警查访，蒋家“民言报”并自动代登启事寻找。
    小贩陈禄平、王胜死了，他们的家属哭哭啼啼的连一口棺材都买不起，另外两个无辜惨死的中国同胞，则僵卧在市立医院冰冷的水门汀上到腐烂了还没有人过问。五条人命终于抵不上一条狼狗！
