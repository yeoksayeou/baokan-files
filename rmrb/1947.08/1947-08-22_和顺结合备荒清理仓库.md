　　Heshuo Combines Preparedness for Famine with Warehouse Cleanup
　　[Report from this newspaper, Heshuo] The entire county, in its financial reorganization, not only paid attention to and vigorously rectified county and village finances, enabling more than 69% of the county's villages to achieve complete self-sufficiency in production, but also conducted a warehouse cleanup from June to August, achieving remarkable results. 1. Commune members, women, and children utilized early morning and evening hours to sun-dry public grain, weigh it, and expose cadres who had privately borrowed grain. While the masses were concentrating all their efforts on actively organizing the gathering of wild vegetables, opening canals, digging wells, planting seedlings, and irrigating fields in an intense campaign, they simultaneously carried out the warehouse cleanup, mobilizing women and children to rush to store, unload, and sun-dry grain in the early mornings and evenings (a small number of people sun-dried during the day). In a short period, the Cengzhuang sub-warehouse sun-dried over 800,000 jin of public grain and identified 2,800 jin of grain privately borrowed by cadres from Fanzhuang, Tuling, Huidiaoqu, and Qiaozhuang. The Yicheng warehouse borrowed 600 jin of rice from the commune warehouse for the civil affairs committee member, sub-warehouse cadre Liu ×× privately borrowed 500 jin of rice, and Shuangfeng borrowed 800 jin, totaling 4,700 jin. The main reason for these problems was that some cadres had the idea that no one would be using the public grain, so they could borrow some and return it in the autumn without anyone knowing. The borrowed grain has now been properly handled and returned to the warehouse. 2. Sub-warehouse cadres personally went to the countryside and went deep among the masses to inspect for hidden grain. In the past, sub-warehouse cadres mostly resided in the organs and rarely went to the countryside, so they did not really understand the storage of public grain. This time, they personally went to the countryside, went deep among the masses, and discovered hidden grain. The Yicheng and Cengzhuang warehouses were able to do this because they listened humbly to the opinions of the masses, so they cleared out 4,600 jin of hidden grain from the Yicheng warehouse, 3,500 jin from the Cengzhuang warehouse, and 500 jin of rice. 3. Through the warehouse cleanup, public grain was appropriately allocated under the principle of saving manpower, and old grain that had been stored for many years and could not be disbursed was processed. During the warehouse cleanup, livestock that came to the county for transportation were used to transport 11,000 jin of millet from the warehouses to the city gates, saving 200 donkeys and completely solving the problem of retail personnel exchanging for rice. During the warehouse cleanup, in addition to clearing out borrowed grain and hidden grain, 45,600 jin of old grain that had been stored for many years and could not be disbursed was appropriately processed, maintaining the quality of public grain and facilitating the storage of public grain.

　　和顺结合备荒清理仓库
    【本报和顺讯】全县在财政整理上，不但注意与大力整顿了县村财政，使全县百分之六十九以上村能全部达到生产自给，而且更于六月至八月二个月内进行了清仓清库，成绩显著。１、社员妇女儿童，利用早晚时间进行公粮翻晒，过秤，检查出干部私自借粮。当群众正在集中全力积极组织打野菜，开渠、打井、种苗、浇田的紧张行动里，结合着同时进行了清仓清库，发动妇女儿童，趁早晚时间抢粮、倒粮、翻晒（白天少数人翻晒），进行清仓。在短时间内，曾庄分仓就翻晒过科公粮八十余万斤，清理检查出范庄、土岭、灰吊曲、乔庄干部私自借粮二千八百斤。仪城仓房上自社仓借给民政委员米六百斤，分仓干部刘××私自借出米五百斤，双峰借出八百斤，总共四千七百斤。这些问题发生，主要是在一些干部中存在着一种公粮无人支，拨借上点秋后归还别人不知道的思想。现已将借出粮食分别处理妥当，全部入了仓库。２、分仓干部亲自下乡，深入群众检查埋伏粮。过去分仓住机关多，下乡少，对公粮保管确实是不很了解的；此次是亲自下乡，深入了群众，发现埋伏粮。仪城曾庄仓库由于做到了这点，虚心听取了群众意见，所以清理出埋伏粮仪城仓四千六百斤，曾庄仓三千五百斤，米五百斤。３、经过清仓，在节省民力原则下，适当调度了公粮，处理了存放多年支拨不出的旧粮。在清仓中，让空来县里运输的牲口，在仓给捎来城关小米一万一千斤，节省了毛驴二百头，完全解决了零星人员兑米问题。在清仓中，除清查出借粮、埋伏粮外，而且适当处理了存放多年支拨不出的旧粮四万五千六百斤，保持了公粮质量，便利了公粮保管。  　（广福）
