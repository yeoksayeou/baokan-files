Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 22nd: Nanjing dispatch: After issuing a declaration on the Weidmeyer mission to China, the All-China Students' Federation submitted a memorandum to U.S. Ambassador Stuart, which was then forwarded to Weidmeyer, demanding that the United States change its China policy and withdraw its troops stationed in China. Attached were numerous photos and materials documenting the persecution of students in May and June, exposing and proving the fascist nature of the Chiang Kai-shek government. Another Associated Press dispatch from Nanjing on the 21st reported that students at Central University conducted a small-scale opinion poll. Among the 40 people surveyed (including professors), 26 believed that Weidmeyer had made no contribution to promoting democracy and unity in China in the past. The poll revealed that most people believed that the United States was trying to expand Taiwan as a strategic base in the Far East, and that U.S. aid to the Chinese (Chiang) government was adding fuel to the fire of China's civil war.

Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 22nd: Shanghai news: The plan for U.S. and Japanese officers to jointly train Chiang Kai-shek's troops is about to begin. According to the Ta Kung Pao here, the 205th Division of the Kuomintang "Youth Army," which is preparing to receive the training, arrived in Taiwan from Guangzhou on the 19th. According to reliable sources from Taiwan: Hasegawa, the former Japanese Governor-General of Taiwan, Kawai, the former president of the puppet Manchukuo Railway Company, and many military personnel, including a Japanese Admiral, have been transported to Taiwan by the United States along with a large number of experts. This shows that while Japan participates in training Chiang's army, Japanese political, military, and economic rule will be restored in Taiwan under U.S. support. In early May of this year, former Japanese Prime Minister Yoshida proposed to MacArthur the hope of obtaining immigration rights to Taiwan and jointly administering the Ryukyu Islands with the United States. Immediately afterward, Japanese Foreign Minister Hitoshi Ashida publicly stated that the Ryukyu Islands and Taiwan should be returned to Japan, and that "technical personnel" should be sent abroad. The current facts prove that the Japanese warlords' conspiracy to invade China has been integrated into the overall U.S. plan to invade China.

Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 22nd: At a time when the Chiang Kai-shek government, ignoring the opposition of the people of the whole country, brazenly opened trade with Japan, Japanese ships have openly appeared on the Chinese sea, engaging in smuggling activities. According to a Central News Agency dispatch from Xiamen on the 20th: The Xiamen Customs recently received a secret report that two Japanese ships were discovered off the coast of Hui'an and Chongwu, loading and unloading smuggled goods in the area. When the customs sent boats to investigate, the Japanese ships had disappeared.

Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 22nd: TASS Shanghai, 20th: The Shanghai Ta Kung Pao editorial stated that the danger of Japan's economic aggression against China is "as serious as its military aggression." But it pointed out that "the danger of economic aggression is now greater than that of military aggression." The editorial also quoted a Chinese expert as saying: Although both will lead to the same outcome, people are generally clear about the danger of military aggression, but often underestimate the danger of economic aggression. If Japan is allowed to maintain its high level of production, as planned by the United States, it will be able to maintain its high war potential in the future, which is extremely dangerous for China.

　　全国学联揭露蒋党残暴统治
  　要求美军滚出中国
    美扶掖下日寇势力侵入台湾
  　日轮公然出现福建海面从事走私
    【新华社陕北二十二日电】南京讯：全国学生联合会对魏德迈来华使命发表宣言之后，复以备忘录一件，经由美大使司徒雷登转交魏德迈，要求美国改变对华政策，撤退在华驻军，并附有学生在五、六月间所受迫害的大量照片与资料，揭露并证明蒋政府的法西斯本质。另据美联社南京二十一日电称：中央大学学生举行了一次小规模的民意测验，在所测验四十人中（包括教授），有二十六人认为魏德迈过去在促进中国民主统一上毫无贡献。投票中显示出多数人相信美国正图扩展台湾为远东战略基地，美国援助中国（蒋）政府，对中国内战实为火上加油。
    【新华社陕北二十二日电】上海消息：美国和日本军官共同训练蒋介石军队之计划，即将开始。据此间大公报载，准备接受该项训练之国民党“青年军”第二○五师，已于十九日由广州运抵台湾。另据来自台湾的确实消息：原台湾日本总督长谷川，原伪满铁会社总裁川及许多军事人员，内有日本海军大将一名，已与大批专家同时为美国运至台湾，此显示与日本参与训练蒋军同时，日本政治、军事、经济各方面之统治将在美国扶掖下，重新君临台湾。今年五月初，日本前首相吉田曾向麦克阿瑟提出希望取得台湾移民权，并与美国共管琉球。紧接着日本外相卢田均公开发表谈话，要求琉球、台湾重归日本，及派遣“技术人员”出国。目前之事实证明，日本军阀侵略中国之阴谋，已被溶合到美国侵华的整个计划中。
    【新华社陕北二十二日电】当此蒋政府不顾举国人民反对悍然开放对日贸易之际，日本轮船已公然出现中国海面，从事走私活动。据中央社二十日厦门电称：厦海关日前接获密报，惠安、崇武海面发现日轮两艘，在该地起卸走私货物，当海关派艇前往查缉时，日轮已无踪迹。
    【新华社陕北二十二日电】塔斯社上海二十日电：上海大公报著论称，日本对华经济侵略的危险，“其严重性一如它的军事侵略”。但指出“经济侵略的危险，现在是大于军事侵略”。该并引用一位中国专家的话：虽然两者都会引致同样的结局，但一般人对军事危险认识得清楚，而常过低估计了经济侵略的危险。如果象美国计划的那样，日本得以保持其高度生产水平，将来他就能保持其高度战争潜力，而这对中国是极为危险的。
