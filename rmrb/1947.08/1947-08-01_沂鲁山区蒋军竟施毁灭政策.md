Xinhua News Agency, East China Front, 20th: Frontline reporter Yan Maozhao reports on the crimes of Chiang Kai-shek's bandits' destructive policies in the Yi-Lu Mountains and the continued annihilation of more than 7,000 Chiang Kai-shek troops, stating that after repeated defeats in their "key offensive" against the Yi-Lu Mountains, Chiang's troops, under the instructions of the war criminal Okamura Neji, followed the Japanese invaders' tactics and implemented a policy of inhumane destruction. Chiang's troops, after invading the area between Donglidian, Lucun, and Tanbu in Yishui, burned all the residents' houses and property. Chiang's air force bombed and strafed refugees fleeing to the liberated areas day and night. In recent days, the Yi-Lu Mountains have been filled with flames and rubble. The People's Liberation Army commanders and fighters of the East China Liberation Army, witnessing the atrocities of Chiang's troops, are filled with rage and determined to kill the enemy and avenge the people. To rescue the elders of the mountain areas, from the 17th to the 21st, they launched a broad and fierce attack on Chiang's troops along the Donglidian-Nanma line, successively taking Chiang's strong fortified areas and destroying hundreds of bunkers. The battle to attack Matougang was particularly heroic. Under the cover of strong firepower, the Liberation Army climbed to the top of the hill, which was more than 600 meters high, and annihilated an entire battalion of the stubborn enemy. The troops of the Liberation Army that penetrated into the mountains successively captured key points such as Niuxinggang and Tianmending south of Lucun, and reached the northern foot of Daigu. Gunsmoke filled the lofty mountains, cannons shook the valleys, and the corpses of Chiang's troops piled up in the gullies. After four days and nights of fierce fighting, they annihilated the 52nd Regiment of the 18th Brigade of Chiang's 11th Division and its engineering battalion, totaling more than 3,000 men, and killed and wounded more than 4,000 men of Chiang's 64th and 25th Divisions. Nearby Chiang's troops shrank into their bunkers, daring not to move rashly. The people of the Yi-Lu Mountains are filled with hatred for the heinous crimes of Chiang's troops. The reporter witnessed the following oath written everywhere on the broken walls: "Father to son, son to grandson, we must settle the blood debt with the American imperialists and the traitor Chiang Kai-shek!" We swear to join the Liberation Army to eliminate all the inhumane invading troops of Chiang Kai-shek! "
