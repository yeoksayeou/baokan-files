Region-wide Welcome Rain
Intensify Crash Planting and Hoeing

[Reported by this newspaper from Taiyue on the 30th] In the past two days, the 25th and 26th of last month, abundant rain fell across the entire region. It has been learned that this includes more than ten counties in the First District, such as Pingyao, Jiexiu, Lingshi, Huo County, Zhaocheng, Qin County, Qinyuan, Anze, Tunliu, and Changzi, the Second District including Fushan and Qinshui, and the Fourth District including Jincheng and Yangcheng. This rain is the first substantial rain since the beginning of the hot season. Autumn seedlings are competing to sprout ears, and the masses are beaming with joy, celebrating the welcome rain together. Currently, Yangcheng and other places are actively preparing to rush plant late autumn vegetables such as buckwheat, radishes, and turnips. Grain prices have also fallen as a result. In Yangcheng alone, millet was previously 2,600 yuan per斗, but has now fallen to 1,400 yuan.

[Reported by this newspaper from Jinnan on the 30th] On the 26th and 27th, the drought-stricken Yongnian, Feixiang, Quzhou (Qi Zhi), Daming, Guangping, and areas north and south of the Zhang River all received substantial rain. Liberated peasants have plunged into a frenzy of rush planting. Various grain seedlings, planted under the leadership of cadres, are already six to seven inches tall. They are thriving after receiving this welcome rain. From Wei County to Xiajin, rain also fell from the night of the 27th until the morning of the 28th.

[News from this newspaper] Abundant rain fell across the entire Taihang region (except for the northern Henan region, where there is no confirmed information) on the 26th and 27th of last month. She County and the area around Wu'an City, which had suffered from prolonged drought, received this welcome rain, and the peasants were overjoyed. All unnecessary gatherings have been suspended, and full efforts are being organized to carry out crash planting and hoeing campaigns.

[News from this newspaper in Shahe] After noon on July 14th, the 3rd and 4th districts and parts of the 5th and 6th districts of this county, totaling 72 villages, experienced a heavy rainstorm. Many villages also suffered serious hail damage; some villages received hail the size of four fingers, while others only received hail the size of two and a half fingers. Cadres from various districts who were attending meetings in the county immediately went down to organize the masses for crash planting. Xincheng Village was hit relatively hard. During discussions, the masses said: "Whether we can survive or not depends on these next two days. Our lifeline depends on whether or not the seedlings are planted." The entire village, including businesses, production personnel from government offices, and livestock, became involved in the crash planting campaign. In just over two days, all unplanted land was sown. In Xiaocheqiao Village, where the hail was only a little over two fingers in size, the masses first went to the west of the village to plant, and also coordinated livestock and carts. Comrades Wang Yingjie and Zhang Chengying from the County Women's Salvation Association personally went to the fields to help the masses pull seed drills and harrows, inspiring more than 120 women in the village to go to the fields. More than a dozen large carts from Beizhang Village that had been pulling "long legs" (likely meaning people traveling long distances) happened to return and participated in the crash planting. Because the village had more livestock this year, they plowed 40 hectares in three days. Xinzhang Village had previously calculated the land of families of revolutionary soldiers in the entire village, and 96 seed drills from 15 groups were dispatched, and by early morning, all 600+ mu of land belonging to families of revolutionary soldiers had been planted. The masses in the hail-stricken areas initially became pessimistic, saying that the soil had been drained of its nutrients by the crops, and even if they replanted, it wouldn't take. After comforting and mobilization by county and district cadres, under the slogans of "Better to lose money on seeds than to not plant at all," "If you have money, buy seeds; if you don't, buy seedlings; eventually, you'll earn back the seed drill. A little delay and the year's harvest will be reduced by a lot," they quickly took action. The scale and intensity of this crash planting were unprecedented. Not only did all able-bodied and semi-able-bodied laborers in the village participate, but women and children from families of revolutionary soldiers in villages such as Xinzhang and Xiaotunqiao also joined in. As a result, the emergency crash planting was particularly rapid. A total of more than 102,000 mu of land was rush-planted in the villages affected by the rain, and most of the seedlings have already emerged from the soil. (Kui Lin)

    全区普降喜雨
    加紧抢种抢锄
    【本报太岳三十日电】本区各地于上月二十五、二十六两日夜普降透雨。已获悉者计有一分区之平（遥）、介（休）、灵（石）、霍（县）、赵（城）、沁（县）、沁（源）、安（泽）、屯（留）、长（子），二分区之浮山、沁水，四分区之晋城、阳城等十余县。此雨系入伏以来首次透雨，秋苗正竞相吐穗，群众莫不喜笑颜开，共贺喜雨。现阳城等地正积极准备赶种荞麦、萝卜、蔓菁等晚秋蔬菜。粮价亦因此下降，仅阳城一地小米每斗为二千六百元，现已降至一千四百元。
    【本报冀南三十日电】二十六、二十七两日，苦旱未雨的永年、肥乡、曲周（企之）、大名、广平、漳河南北地区，均获透雨。翻身农民纷纷投入抢种热潮。经各地干部领导点种抢种之各种谷物苗长六七寸许。获此透雨勃然向荣。威县以迄夏津，亦于二十七日夜获雨至二十八日未止。
    【本报讯】太行全区（除豫北地区未获确息外）于上月二十六、七两日，普降透雨。久已苦旱之涉县及武安城周围等地，获此喜雨，农民莫不喜形于色，各地均已停止一切不必要的集会，组织全力，开展抢种抢锄运动。
    【本报沙河讯】七月十四日午后，本县三四区及五六区的一部地区共七十二个村庄下了一阵暴风雨，不少村还带着严重的雹灾，有的村下了四指，有的就只下了二指半。各区正在县里开会的干部，便马上分头下去组织群众抢种。新城村下的比较大，群众讨论中说：“能过不能过就在这两天，命根儿就在于苗子安上安不上。”全村群众和商号、机关生产人员及牲口都卷入了抢种运动，两天多的时间把全部未种的地都下了种。小车桥村西下的小只有二指多，群众就先到村西去种，并且调剂了牲口和车。县妇救会王英杰、张成英二同志，亲自下地帮助群众拉耧拉耙子，影响起全村一百二十多个妇女都下了地。北掌村出外边拉长脚的十几辆大车，恰好也都赶回来，正碰上参加抢种。该村因为今年牲口添的多了，三天就耕了四十顷。新章村事先计算了全村的抗属土地，十五个组九十六张耧，分头出动，一清早就把抗属的六百多亩全数种完。雹灾地区群众开始悲观，说地被庄稼把劲儿吸完了，再种上也不沾了。经过县区干部安慰动员后，在“种地赔不怕，不种更没法。”“有钱买种，没钱买苗，直至以后争回耧，迟一会儿年景就减多少。”的口号下，迅速行动起来。这次抢种的规模和紧张情况是空前的，因为节令不容人，不但全村全半劳力都下了手，新章、小屯桥等村的抗属妇女儿童也都参加了。因此突击抢种就特别迅速，共计这次下雨村庄抢种了十万零二千余亩，大部苗子已经出土了。（奎林）
