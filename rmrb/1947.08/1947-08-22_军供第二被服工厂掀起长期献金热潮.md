　　Military Supply Second Clothing Factory Launches Long-Term Donation Craze

　　[Reported by this newspaper] The workers of the Second Clothing Factory of the Military Region Supply Department, in early August, once again launched a donation craze, and even more universal long-term donations appeared. As of the 18th, the total amount of donations for August has exceeded 800,000 yuan. After the "August 1st" newspaper published the news of the Third Factory's donation, the workers of the Second Factory spontaneously initiated a donation campaign, competing with the workers of other factories as brothers. First, tailor Chang Guicheng proposed to donate 100 catties of rice every month from "August 1st" until Chiang Kai-shek was defeated. Tian Chunsheng followed up in response, donating 50 catties of rice every month. After this news was spread on the blackboard newspaper, it immediately caused a sensation throughout the factory. Each group automatically discussed it during and after dinner, with some groups even discussing it until late at night. The next day, red happy reports were posted all over the blackboard and walls, with a rush to report their donation amounts. Next came Comrade Wei Jinqi, donating 100 catties of rice every month until the bandit Chiang was defeated; Yuan Citong donating 60 catties of rice every month; Tian Fushan, Dong Xueru, Li Hezheng, Hao Zongtang, Lou Fengqi, and Li Youming, donating 50 catties of rice every month; Zhao Zhenhai, Li Guichen, Zhang Shiyin, Liu Shuangmi, and Zhang Cangzhou, donating 40 catties of rice every month. Zhao Baoqing, Cui Jintang, and 14 other comrades, donating 30 catties of rice every month. There were 22 comrades, including Wu Jinqin, donating less than 20 catties of rice every month. The above-mentioned long-term rice donors totaled 52 people, with a total monthly donation of 1,605 catties of rice; there were 12 people, including Chen Yu, donating rice regularly for three to five months to a year, with a total of 1,205 catties of rice. In addition, there were 37 general donors, including Liu Yuqing, Li Chunwang, and Jia Zhengxiang, donating a total of 300,845 yuan, of which 16 people each donated more than 10,000 yuan. Among the general donations, the collective donors included the tailoring group (15 people) with 200,000 yuan, the fifth machining group (9 people) with 47,800 yuan, and the first machining group (9 people) with 39,300 yuan, totaling 287,100 yuan. This donation was entirely spontaneous from the workers, and the new workers who had been in the factory for a relatively short period of time took the lead. A total of 107 people participated.
