　　Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, August 21st: Moscow dispatch: Viktorov wrote in Pravda on the 16th, commenting on the contradictions between Britain, the United States, and France, stating: The "European reconstruction" as interpreted by the United States reveals deep contradictions between the United States and Britain, as well as between Britain, the United States, and France. When the Paris Conference was convened, Britain attempted to find a way out of its own difficulties. It requested the United States to provide loans as quickly as possible, hoping to "save face" for its policies, which had been widely criticized in Britain, and also to raise its status when discussing the Ruhr issue with the United States. However, the Americans, who were very well-informed about the situation in Britain, felt that the weaker Britain's situation was, the more the British authorities would demand American "aid" to get out of their predicament, which would be more beneficial to the United States. The author asserted: The "cooperation" between Britain and the United States in the Ruhr is one aspect of the extremely deep and serious contradiction between Britain and the United States. No matter what the outcome of the Washington talks, this contradiction cannot be eliminated. In any case, the Anglo-American contradiction has considerably delayed the implementation of the Marshall Plan. The author went on to say about France: It must be admitted that French policy has repeatedly suffered setbacks. Not only has the hope of a steady flow of Ruhr coal not been realized, but it also faces the threat of Germany's resurgence under the American plan. France demanded to participate in the Anglo-American talks on the level of the German steel industry, but the answer it received was: If France continues to resist, it will only be allowed into the waiting room of the Washington talks. If it surrenders, it can enter the conference room. However, the final decision on this issue still rests with the United States and Britain. The French have realized that the price of participating in the Ruhr talks is the merger of the French zone with the British and American zones. This means that France will ultimately lose its independent policy towards Germany. The author finally emphasized that the Soviet Union has repeatedly insisted on the four powers jointly controlling the Ruhr. Any decision passed as a result of negotiations and agreements between Britain and the the United States, or Britain, the United States and France, cannot be considered valid because they fundamentally violate existing agreements, first and foremost the Potsdam Agreement.

　　Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, August 21st: News from various sources: The Anglo-American conference on amending the loan terms opened in Washington on the 18th. The British delegation was led by a senior administrative official, Idi, while the American side was headed by Treasury Secretary Snyder and included Acting Secretary of State Lovett. According to the London Sunday Telegraph diplomatic correspondent on the 19th: At the meeting, the British delegation, in addition to requesting amendments to the terms of the American loan regarding the free convertibility of the pound and non-discrimination against American goods, will also raise the entire issue of the British crisis. Among these issues, Britain will explore whether the United States can provide Britain with new loans after the loan is used up (Editor's note: after this loan was redrawn by Britain by $150 million on August 14, only $850 million remained, and it is generally estimated that this balance may be used up within six or eight weeks) and before the "Marshall Plan" is implemented. However, the correspondent said: In the negotiations, Britain has little chance of obtaining American "temporary assistance." It is reported that new US aid to Britain is conditional on Britain accepting the US Ruhr plan and delaying the nationalization of British industry. US Deputy Secretary of State Clayton and the State Department believe that aid to Britain will only be given if Britain delays its nationalization and postpones the plan to socialize German industry. The official mouthpiece, the US News Service, also revealed on the 18th: "It is expected that the current discussions between Britain and the United States on the issue of increasing coal production in the Ruhr will be included in the conference on amending loan terms." Therefore, it is no accident that the US delegation participating in the talks included Assistant Secretary of State Thorp, head of the US delegation to the Anglo-American Ruhr Coal Production Conference.

　　Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, August 20th: Paris dispatch: After the so-called "European Economic Recovery Conference" closed on July 15, the "European Cooperation Committee" composed of representatives from sixteen countries has held many meetings to study the "implementation" of the Marshall Plan in Western Europe. As a result of the research, an "investigation form" was formulated by the "Executive Committee" (controlled by China, Britain, and France, but actually at the beck and call of the United States) to investigate the economies of various countries from 1947 to 1951, including food and raw material shortages, the possible extent of industrial equipment and import and export trade, the balance of financial revenue and expenditure, and so on. According to Soviet reporter Zhukov: "Trying to control the economies of various countries based on the strengths and weaknesses of their economies." According to TASS: The commanders of Western European countries and the three US, British, and French occupation zones in Germany have now filled out this investigation form as ordered. However, the information filled in by many countries is, if not incorrect, at least incomplete, because they know this secret and independence related to their own economy. Many countries are greatly disturbed by this, especially Italy. After the British and French representatives secretly discussed with the Italian representatives the US instructions on Italian industrial development, Italian industrialists immediately realized that this was an order for them to abandon the major industries that could make money, such as smelting, man-made fibers, papermaking, machine manufacturing, automobiles, and chemicals, and to "develop freely" light metal manufacturing, small-tonnage shipbuilding, and alcohol industries that damage the Italian national economy for the benefit of American monopoly capitalists. Therefore, Italian industrialists have risen up to demand government protection "from foreign interference." Even the Italian right-wing newspaper "Giornale" stated: "We were invited to Paris, not to get something, but to take something out."

　　Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, August 15th: The dumping of American films has aroused opposition from European countries. The British government has decided to impose a high import tax of 75% on American films. The International Film Industry Union Congress held in Prague recently also passed a resolution strongly condemning the suggestion by American experts to the United Nations Economic Council to classify films as industrial exports. Furthermore: The American Film Export Association and fifty production companies decided on the 7th and 8th to immediately stop all American film exports to Britain in order to put pressure on Britain "until Britain revises its film import tax."

　　美英法间矛盾深刻苏联坚持共管鲁尔
    【新华社陕北二十一日电】莫斯科讯：维克托洛夫十六日于真理报著文评英美法矛盾称：依照美国所解释的“欧洲重建”，暴露出美英之间以及英美与法国之间的深刻矛盾。在召开巴黎会议时，英国曾图寻求解脱出自己困难的出路，文要求美国尽速贷款，想以此在英国国内为自己已遭广泛不满的政策“挽回面子”，并图在与美国商谈鲁尔问题时，抬高自己的身价。可是对英国情况消息非常灵通的美国人，则觉得英国情势愈弱，英国当局就愈会要求美国的“援助”以求摆脱自己的困境，这对美国愈为有利。作者断言：英美在鲁尔的“合作”正是英美极深刻极严重的矛盾之一面，不管华府谈判结果如何，这种矛盾决不能消除。无论如何，英美矛盾已相当大地延缓了马歇尔计划的实现。作者继说到法国称：应当承认，法国政策一再遭到挫折。不仅源源输入鲁尔煤的希望未能实现，而且面临美国计划下德国再起的威胁。法国要求参加关于德国钢业水平的英美会谈，但得到的回答则是：如果法国继续抵抗，它将只许进入华府商谈的会客室。如果投降，则可进入会议室。但是，这个问题的最后决定权仍属英美。法国人已经明白，参加鲁尔会谈的代价就是法占区与英美占区合并。也即表示法国最后丧失其独立的对德政策。作者最后强调指出：苏联曾一再坚持四强共管鲁尔，英美双方或英美法三方谈判和协议结果所通过的任何决定，都不可能被认为有效，因为他们根本违犯了现存的各种协议，首先是波茨顿协定。
    【新华社陕北二十一日电】各方讯：英美关于修改贷款条件的会议，于十八日在华府召开。英方代表团由一高级行政官员伊地率领，美方则已财长斯奈德为首，并包括代理国务卿罗维特在内。据伦敦星期电讯报外交记者十九日称：会上英代表团除要求修改美国贷款条件中关于英镑自由兑换及不歧视美货的条文外，并将提出英国危机的全部问题。在这些问题中，英国将探求在用完贷款（编者按：此项贷款于八月十四日由英国再提用一亿五千万元后，仅余八亿五千万元，一般估计此余额可能在六周或八周之内用罄），及“马歇尔计划”实行前，美国是否可能予英以新的贷款。但该记者称：在谈判中，英国获取美国“临时援助”的机会很少。据息：美对英新援助须以英国接受美国鲁尔计划并延缓英国工业的国有化为交换条件，美副国卿克莱顿及国务院认为只有在英国延缓国有化和将德国工业社会化的计划延期实行，才给英国援助。官方喉舌美新闻处十八日电也透露：“料目下英美对于鲁尔增加煤产问题之讨论，或将列入修改贷款条件会议中。”因此，参与会谈的美代表团中并包括英美鲁尔煤产会议之美方代表团团长助理国务卿索尔普当非偶然。
    【新华社陕北二十日电】巴黎讯：七月十五日所谓“欧洲经济复兴会议”闭幕后，十六国代表所组成的“欧洲合作委员会”，曾先后举行了不少会议，以研究马歇尔计划在西欧的“实现”。研究结果，由“执行委员会”（中英法所操纵的，实际上是听命于美国的）制定了一个“调查表”，调查一九四七年到一九五一年各国的经济，包括食物与原料缺余情况，工业设备与进出口贸易的可能程度，财政的收支平衡情形等等。据苏名记者朱可夫称：“力图根据各该国经济的长短处，来控制各国的经济。”据塔斯社讯：西欧各国及德境美英法三国占领区司令现已如命填好了这张调查表。然而许多国家所填报的情况，如非不正确的，至少也是不完全的，因为他们知道这个有关自国的经济的秘密与独立。很多国家对此都大表不安，其中特别是意大利。当英法代表与意大利代表密谈美国对意工业发展的指示后，意大利工业家立刻明白，这是命令他们放弃能够赚钱的冶炼、人造纤维、造纸、机器制造、汽车及化学等主要工业，而为美国独占资本家利益去“放手发展”轻金属制造、小吨位造船及酒精等损害意大利国民经济的工业。因此，意工业家纷起要求政府保护，“免受外国干涉”。就是意大利右翼报纸“基奥纳尔。”也称：“我们被邀去巴黎，不是使我们得到什么，而要我们拿出东西来。”
    【新华社陕北十五日电】美国的影片倾销，激起了欧洲各国的反对。英政府已决定对美国影片征收百分之七十五的高额入口税。在布拉格举行之国际电影业工会大会，最近亦通过决议，对美国专家建议联合国经济理事会将影片列为工业品输出一事，加以严斥。又：美国影片输出协会及五十家制片公司为了对英国施行压力，已于七、八两日决定立即停止一切美国影片输英，“直至英国修正其影片输入税而后止”。
