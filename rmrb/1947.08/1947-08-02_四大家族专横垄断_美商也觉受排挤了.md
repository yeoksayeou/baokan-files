    The Four Families' Autocratic Monopoly
    American Businesses Also Feel Squeezed
    Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 30th—American imperialist elements' policy of aiding the Chiang government is causing extreme unease even among American businessmen in China. According to a United Press Shanghai dispatch on the 26th, an American businessman told their reporter, "Over the past few years, the US government has spent 3 to 4 billion US dollars in China (referring to Chiang's small court), but the situation has not improved, but rather deteriorated. This money is entirely used to support a bureaucratic China. We don't understand the reason for sending the Wedemeyer mission. The person who sent them (referring to US Secretary of State Marshall) knows more about China than he does. Does this mean the US government is looking for an excuse to pour more money into China? From the perspective of American businesses, we strongly oppose this. Unless this money is used for special programs and under American supervision." American businessmen expressed dissatisfaction with the autocratic monopoly of the "Chinese privileged families" (i.e., Chiang, Soong, Kung, and Chen), which has continuously squeezed the business of American companies in China. They pointed out that the four families subject them to "two malicious discriminations: first, seemingly legitimate government (i.e., the Chiang government) agencies and companies established by their families and in-laws are trying to monopolize the market, thereby weakening the import of goods from established American companies and excluding these companies. Second, companies operated or controlled by privileged families can use political pressure to force foreign (including American) manufacturers, transporters, or brokers to transfer exclusive distributorships to them." Another shady practice that dissatisfies American businessmen is the ability of privileged families to evade tariffs. For example, a merchant from an American company said that it imported a truck for $1,200, sold it for $2,000 after paying tariffs; while the "new company" of the Chinese privileged families imported the same truck at the same price. In addition to evading tariff burdens, it also sold it for a high price of $8,000. The same is true for other luxury goods such as electric refrigerators. American businessmen said that this greatly exacerbated inflation in China (referring to the Chiang-controlled areas).

    四大家族专横垄断
    美商也觉受排挤了
    【新华社陕北三十日电】美帝国主义分子援助蒋政府的政策，甚至在华美国商人中间亦对此极端不安。据合众社上海二十六日电，某美国商人告该社记者称：“过去数年，美政府在中国（按即蒋家小朝廷）耗费了三十亿元至四十亿元，但局势未见好转反而恶化。这些钱完全用来支持一个官僚主义的中国。我们不理解派遣魏德迈代表团原因何在？派遣他们来的人（按指美国务卿马歇尔）比他更了解中国。这是否意味着美政府正在找寻借口俾便以更多的金钱投入中国呢？站在美商立场，我们激烈反对此举。除非此项金钱是用于特种计划的并在美国的监督之下。”美商对“中国特权家族”（即蒋、宋、孔、陈）的专横垄断，使在华美商的营业也受到不断排挤一事表示不满，他们指出四大家族对他们“两种恶意的歧视：第一、似是而非的政府（即蒋政府）机关及其家族与姻亲设立的公司，正设法垄断市场，借此削弱美商各老牌公司的货物进口，而排斥这些公司。第二、特权家族所经营或控制的公司，能够运用政治压力，压迫外国（包括美国在内）的制造家、运输商、或经纪人，将独家经理权转移给他们。”另一件使美国商人不满的黑幕，是特权家族的能够逃避关税，例如某美国公司商人说，它以一千二百美元输入一辆卡车，交纳关税后以二千美元售出；而中国特权家族的“新公司”以同样价格输入卡车，它除了可以逃避关税负担外，还以八千元美元高价售出，其他如奢侈品电气冰箱等亦复如是，美商说这样大大增剧了中国（指蒋管区）的通货膨胀。
