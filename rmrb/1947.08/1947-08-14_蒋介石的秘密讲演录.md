Xinhua News Agency, Jinji-Luyu Front, 12th: One of the spoils of the Lusi Victory is a record of Chiang Kai-shek's secret speeches to officers of the Central Training Corps. Due to repeated military defeats, Chiang Kai-shek began rotating frontline officers of the regiment level and above in Nanjing from late April, each term lasting about a month. It has now been held for four terms. In his secret speeches, Chiang Kai-shek had to admit the military failures he has been hiding in his public announcements, and was filled with despair about the future of the war. He admitted that the Kuomintang army was inferior to the People's Liberation Army in every way. Chiang Kai-shek said: "More than a year of 'bandit suppression' experience has made the General Headquarters most distressed by:
	(A) Command posts are constantly being wiped out, and commanders are constantly being captured;
	(B) Reinforcements cannot arrive, and are eliminated by the bandits en route. At this rate, I really don't know what to do."
He said: "The General Headquarters has exhausted all kinds of methods to encourage you to obtain important documents and materials of the communist bandits, but unfortunately, there have been no great achievements for more than a year. This time we obtained two booklets. I tell you, I was so happy to get these two books as if I had obtained a treasure, and I studied them word by word day and night. Now, I have read them five times, and I will distribute them to you today. You must also use your greatest strength to study them. Look, how thorough our enemies are in various researches, and how frank and sincere they are in self-criticism; how close their army's organization is, and how strict their discipline is; especially for strategic tactics, they have established a system. Research, development, implementation, and reform have all formed a system; looking back at us, what can we compare with them?"
He said: "The strength of the communist bandits lies in organization. The weakness of the national army lies in non-cooperation. Fighting with an untrained and disorganized army against the communist bandits is just fighting a muddled war for a year. The reason why the 'bandit suppression' has had a little victory in the past year, to be frank, is entirely due to the protection of the late Premier and the spirits of the fallen soldiers in heaven."
After Chiang Kai-shek so thoroughly exposed his incompetence, he suddenly changed his argument and said that his enemies were not so clever, and he completely pushed the responsibility for the failure to his subordinates, not saying that he was not worthy to command them, but that they were not worthy to be commanded by him.
The third training session was held after Chiang's confidant Zhang Lingfu's 74th Division was wiped out in Mengyin in mid-May. Zhang had attacked Chiang, saying that other generals were unable to fight. Although it was Zhang Lingfu himself who had failed after diligently studying and implementing Chiang Kai-shek's instructions, Chiang Kai-shek used his words to shirk responsibility onto others. He said: "Today, I must first read to you a letter that Zhang Lingfu, the commander of the 74th Division, personally gave me before his death. This letter says: 'The bandits are erratic, while we are at a loss for advance and retreat. The bandits are terrifying, but the hearts of ordinary generals are truly terrifying, mutually restraining and watching.' I was very moved after reading his letter, so I gave him a telegram, but this telegram had not arrived before he died." Chiang Kai-shek blamed his subordinates and said: "What is so terrifying or mysterious about the communist bandits? The General Headquarters studied in detail and then gave you more instructions, but you did not study them. The war in Shandong failed so quickly, and this is entirely the result of your not studying! The result of not reading." "You say that the current formations are of different sizes. This statement is completely wrong. For example, Laiwu is only a few dozen miles away from Mengyin. Sending a division to provide assistance, you say that there are too few people to dare to go; and then two more divisions were sent, but what was the result? Within three hours, the enemy completely eliminated them. Is this because there were too few soldiers? Or is it for what reason?" "You see the annihilation of friendly troops and do not rescue them; if the enemy annihilates others, it will be your turn. The 74th Division was annihilated, and you will become the 74th Division." "We have good soldiers and lower-level cadres, but you learn to be proud and do not seek progress. With incompetent command, the result is that all are sacrificed without value. I tell you, you people are really not worthy to be subordinates of my command."
Since Chiang Kai-shek did not review the fundamental errors of his political and strategic decisions, he could only boast about the old-fashioned principles he had touted in Jiangxi more than ten years ago, and he could only use methods of threats and inducements to his subordinates as if they were children. He said: "I have said that in more than a year of 'bandit suppression' war, the biggest weaknesses of our army are that command posts are constantly being attacked, commanders are constantly being captured, and reinforcements cannot arrive and are eliminated by the bandits on the way. How can we avoid this kind of incident? That is the several major principles I instructed when suppressing bandits in Jiangxi: search, reconnaissance, cover, and close observation."
Chiang Kai-shek once again announced the so-called joint responsibility law, saying: "If the chief officer does not retreat but the subordinates retreat first, causing injury or death to the chief officer, the next-level officer will be killed. If the subordinates do not retreat but the chief officer retreats first, the chief officer will be killed. Those who see difficulty and do not rescue, causing serious injury to friendly troops and remaining intact themselves, will have the generals of the army killed." He also induced them, saying: "As long as you are loyal to your duties and brave to go forward, your merits will certainly not be buried after the bandits are eliminated, and your positions must be maintained for you. I tell you, after the bandits are eliminated, we will still maintain ninety national defense divisions in peacetime. The formation of the national defense division is one division with two brigades and six regiments; that is to say, compared to the current one division with three brigades and six regiments, we only cancel one brigade headquarters, and the unit of the regiment will not be changed. And the current army happens to meet this number." "I tell you again, the General Headquarters has already established a plan to establish a personnel promotion system. Future promotions will not be based on seniority first, but on battle achievements first, academic qualifications second, and seniority third." He also made threats, saying: "If the 'bandit suppression' fails, our generals will inevitably be executed one by one by the communist army. This is an inevitable law. I really don't understand, you can not care about the future of the country and the nation, and you can not cherish the fifty years of glorious revolutionary history, but don't you have a little love for your own lives and honors?"
Facts have shown that captured generals of the Chiang army were not only not "executed one by one" by the People's Liberation Army, but also lived very well. Many of them believed that being captured was liberation, and from then on they had a bright future. Facts have also shown that this kind of training personally presided over by Chiang Kai-shek had little effect. After four training sessions, in the Lusi battle, the number of Chiang's army command posts being attacked, commanders being captured, and reinforcements being eliminated broke previous records. Luo Zhedong, the deputy commander of the 70th Division who was captured in Jinxi, used simple words to say more truth than Chiang Kai-shek's long speeches: "The problem on our side is the lack of political capital. What are we fighting for today? What will tomorrow be like? The future is completely dark. Where is the courage to bleed and sacrifice? How can we not be defeated!"
Captured generals revealed that Chiang Kai-shek recently often said to his subordinates: "I am already sixty-one years old and will not be in this world for long. In the future, history will not know what kind of sinner I will be written as. Everything depends on you." Saying that, he shed tears. He also promoted an extremely discouraging slogan to them, called "Finishing fighting is also finished, not finishing fighting is still finished, better to finish fighting and be finished; not allowed to not finish fighting and still be finished." The officers said that although they could not accept this slogan, they were still interested in going to Nanjing for training, because at least during training, they could avoid fighting and not be captured. For example, in the Huainan and Siping battles in Northeast China in May and June, the 88th and 91st divisions of Chen Mingren's 71st Army were completely wiped out, and the 87th Division was also mostly wiped out. The remaining remnants of the army were only two or three thousand people, but their division commanders were spared because they were training in Nanjing.

### 蒋介石的秘密讲演录

　　蒋介石的秘密讲演录
    【新华社晋冀鲁豫前线十二日电】鲁西大捷的战利品之一，是蒋介石对其中央训练团受训军官的秘密讲演录。蒋介石因军事上连遭惨败，从四月下旬起，在南京轮训前方团以上军官，每期约一个月，现已办至四期。蒋介石在其秘密讲演中，不能不承认他在公开宣布中至今还隐瞒着的军事失败，并充满对战争前途的绝望情绪。他承认国民党军队没有一样能比得上人民解放军，蒋介石说：“一年多来的剿匪经验，使统帅部最感苦恼的是：
    （甲）指挥部不断被歼，指挥官不断被俘；
    （乙）援军不能到达，而中途被匪解决，这样下去，真不知如何得了。”
    他说：“统帅部曾用尽种种方法，鼓励你们去取得奸匪的重要文件材料来，可惜一年多来，都没有什么大成绩。这次我们取得了两本册子，我告诉你们，我拿到这两本书，真欢喜得如获至宝，日以继夜一字一句研究。现在，我已看过五遍，今天即发给你们，你们也要用最大的力量去研究。你们看，我们的敌人对于各种研究是如何彻底，自我检讨是如何坦白诚恳；他们军队的组织是如何紧密，纪律如何的严明；尤其对于战略战术，他们已确立了一个体系。研究发展实行改革都已成立一个体系；反观我们，那一样比得上？”
    他说：“共匪长处，在组织。国军短处，在不合作。以无训练无组织的军队，去和共匪作战，只是打一年糊涂仗。一年来的剿共，所以还稍有一点胜利，坦白说一句，完全是靠先总理和阵亡将士在天之灵的护持。”
    蒋介石在如此彻底暴露了自己的无能以后，突然转变论点说，他的敌人并没有什么高明，他把失败的责任完全推给他的部下，不说自己不配指挥他们，而说他们不配受他指挥。
    第三期训练是在蒋的心腹张灵甫七十四师五月中旬在蒙阴被歼灭以后举行的，张曾向蒋攻击其他一般将领都不能作战，虽然失败的正是努力研究和执行蒋介石指示的张灵甫自己，但是蒋介石却用他的话来诿过于人。他说：“今天我首先要把七十四师师长张灵甫死前亲给我的一封信宣读给大家听，这封信上说：‘匪则飘忽不定，我则进退失据。匪可畏，而一般将领之心则诚可畏，互相牵制观望。’我读了他的信，心里非常感动，便给了他一个电报，但这个电还没有到达他便殉难了。”蒋介石责备他的部下说：“奸匪究竟有什么可畏，有什么神秘呢？统帅部详细研究，然后给了你们更多指示，但你们不去研究。山东的战事失败得这样迅速，这完全是你们不研究！不读书的结果。”“你们说，现在的编制大小不一，这种说法，完全是错误的。比方说，莱芜距蒙阴不过数十里路，派一个师去赴援，说人太少不敢去；又派了两个师，但结果如何？三个钟头之内，被敌人整个解决，这是兵太少吗？还是为了什么原因？”“你们看到友军的歼灭而不救；敌人歼灭了别的，就会轮到你们头上。七十四师被歼灭了，而你们也就跟着成为七十四师。”“我们有很好的士兵和下级干部，学习你们的平时骄傲，不求进取，指挥无方，结果都作了无代价的牺牲。我告诉你们，你们这样的人，实在不配做我统帅的部下。”
    蒋介石既然毫不检讨自己政略战略的根本错误，因此除了把自己十几年前在江西曾经遭受惨败的空调原则搬出来吹嘘一番以外，就只有对部下象对小孩似的施行威胁利诱的办法。他说：“我已说过，年余的剿匪战争，我军最大的弱点为指挥部不断被袭击，指挥官不断被俘，及援军不能到达，中途被匪消灭。要怎样才能避免这种事件呢？那便是我在江西剿匪时所指示的：搜索、侦察、掩护、严密观察等几个大原则。”
    蒋介石又一次向他们宣布所谓连坐法说：“主官不退而部下先退，致主官有伤亡情势者，杀其次级官。部下未退而主官先退者杀其主官。见难不救致友军有重伤而己身完整者，杀该军将领。”他又引诱他们说：“只要你们忠于职守，勇敢以赴，在消灭了匪徒以后，你们的功劳是一定不会被淹没的，你们的地位是一定要为你们保持的。我告诉你们，在匪徒肃清后，我们仍然要在平时保持九十个国防师，国防师的编制是一师两旅六团；就是说，比起现在的一师三旅六团来，我们只取消了一个旅部，团的单位是不会变更的。而现在的军队，恰巧合乎这个数目”。“我再告诉你们，现在统帅部已预立了一项计划，就是要确立人事升迁制度，以后的升级不是资历第一，而第一是战绩，第二是学术，第三才轮到资历。”他又造出恐吓说：“如果剿匪失败，我们将领必被共军一一处死，这是必然定律。我真不明白，你们对于国家民族的前途可以不计较，对于五十年光荣革命历史可以不爱护，但你们对于本身的生命荣誉难道也没有一点爱护之心吗？”
    事实表明，蒋军被俘将领不但未被解放军“一一处死”，而且生活得很好，其中许多人认为被俘就是解放，从此有了光明前途。事实又表明蒋介石亲自主持的这种训练，效果很少，在训练了四期以后，鲁西战役中蒋军指挥部被袭，指挥官被俘，援军被消灭的数字，反而打破了以前的纪录。在晋西被俘的七十师副师长罗哲东，用简单的话比蒋介石的长篇大论说出了更多的真理：“我们那边的问题是没有政治资本，今天为了什么？明天是个什么样子？眼前一片漆黑，那里有勇气流血牺牲？怎么能不打败仗！”
    被俘的将领们泄露蒋介石最近常向部下说：“我已六十一岁了，在世不久，将来历史上不知要把我写成怎样的罪人，一切都看你们了。”说着就大流其眼泪。他并向他们宣传一个极端丧气的口号，叫做“打完亦完，不打完仍完，宁可打完了完；不可打不完亦完。”军官们说他们虽不能接受这口号，但对于到南京受训仍感兴趣，因为至少在受训的时候，他们可以不打仗，不当俘虏。例如五、六月间在东北怀南、四平两战役中，七十一军陈明仁所部八十八师、九十一师全部被歼，八十七师亦大部被歼，该军所余残部不过二三千人，但其各师长因在南京受训幸免于难。
