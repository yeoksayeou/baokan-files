Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 18th: Reports from various sources indicate that the Chiang government is continuously shipping large quantities of edible salt to Japan. Of the 3.2 million dan of Qingdao salt originally scheduled for export to Japan, 660,000 dan have already been shipped since mid-June. Currently, another 900,000 dan of Qing salt are being continuously transported there. According to sources in Qingdao, on the 28th of last month, eight Japanese ships, flying the Japanese flag, sailed into Qingdao and anchored in the harbor for two days and nights, fully loaded with Qing salt before departing. This matter has incited outrage among the citizens of Qingdao. Furthermore, another 300,000 dan of Taiwanese salt will continue to be allocated for shipment to Japan. At the same time, the Chiang government, following the intentions of the United States, has decided to ship large quantities of Taiwanese salt to the US-occupied zone of Korea, with the initial quantity determined to be 1 million dan.
