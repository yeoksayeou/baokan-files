    [Special Dispatch from This Newspaper] On August 1st at 5 PM, all circles in Shanxi-Hebei-Shandong-Henan solemnly held a meeting at the military region's residence to celebrate the 20th anniversary of the founding of the People's Liberation Army. At this moment, victory messages kept pouring in from the front lines. Especially after the Liu and Deng armies crossed the natural barrier of the Yellow River and swept across the Chiang Kai-shek's troops, eliminating nine and a half brigades of Chiang Kai-shek's regular army in just twenty short days. The cadres attending the meeting celebrated this great festival with boundless excitement and the greatest enthusiasm. At the celebration meeting, Deputy Commander Teng spoke on the stage. He recounted the 20-year history of the heroic struggle of the Red Army to the People's Liberation Army, explaining its origin, development, and characteristics. From the day of its birth, the Red Army was always for the interests of the nation and the people, sharing weal and woe with the people. It grew and strengthened in countless battles and overcoming numerous difficulties, starting from a few red-tasseled spears and broken guns, and now possessing modernized weapons seized from the enemy, eliminating enemies from sporadic annihilation to eliminating them by the thousands and tens of thousands, becoming an indestructible and invincible force.

    Why have we achieved such great results now? Deputy Commander Teng spoke about the ten lessons and experiences of our party's army building over the past 20 years. Among them, the most important is the correct leadership of the Party, Chairman Mao, and Commander-in-Chief Zhu. Also, because our army is the people's army, it has brought into play the qualities of "from the people, belonging to the people, and for the people." Various excellent systems have been established in the army, the first being political work and the political commissar system. Patient national education and class education have been carried out in the army, so it can still fight heroically and selflessly for the cause of national liberation and people's liberation, and so on.

    Finally, Deputy Commander Teng put forward the task of commemorating "August 1st," which is to demand that the People's Liberation Army be built more perfectly and strongly, develop a just patriotic self-defense war, and resolutely, thoroughly, cleanly, and completely eliminate all Chiang Kai-shek's invading troops. Strive to fully realize the sixteen slogans issued by our Party Central Committee on "July 7th."

    Then Chairman Yang spoke, he said: First, the strength of the People's Liberation Army is the victory of Chairman Mao's and Commander-in-Chief Zhu's political and military line, and it is also the brilliant achievement of commanders and fighters at all levels in implementing Chairman Mao's and Commander-in-Chief Zhu's political and military line. We should strengthen the study of Mao Zedong Thought and strengthen the study of the army's military and political leaders' efforts to implement Mao Zedong Thought. Second, deeply appreciate the hardships of the combat troops. The troops are fighting the enemy in the scorching heat, rain, snow, and mud; sometimes they can't get food or buy vegetables, and thousands and thousands of sick and wounded soldiers are lying in bed. The rear personnel should not only ensure the supply to the front line and do their best to support and comfort them, but also everyone should redouble their efforts and step up their work, overcome any slackness or degeneration, do their work better, and make the front line have a more consolidated and stronger rear. Third, do a good job in supporting the front line. Fourth, combine with land reform and production movements, and thoroughly check the work of supporting the army. Respect military families, retired soldiers, and help them produce and establish their families.

    Finally, Vice-Chairman Xing of the参议会 spoke. The meeting ended at nine o'clock.

    晋冀鲁豫各界
    举行庆祝“八一”大会
    滕副司令员号召贯彻党中央“七七”口号
    【本报特讯】八月一日下午五时，晋冀鲁豫各界于军区驻地隆重举行人民解放军诞生二十周年纪念大会。此时前线胜利消息纷纷传来，尤其是刘、邓大军强渡天险黄河后，横扫蒋军，仅仅二十天的短促时间，即消灭了蒋军正规军九个半旅，到会干部更以无限兴奋的心情，最大的热诚来庆祝这伟大的节日。庆祝会上，滕副司令员登台讲话。他叙述了红军到人民解放军英勇斗争的二十年历史。说明她的产生、发展及其特点。红军从诞生那天起，即时时刻刻为了民族利益，人民利益，与人民共甘苦、同患难。她在无数次战斗中与重重困难中发展壮大，由几条红缨枪、破枪起家，到现在有了从敌人手里夺过来的近代化的武器，由零星消灭敌人到现在成千成万的消灭敌人，变成一支拖不垮、打不烂、无坚不摧的一支力量。
    为什么有现在这样大的成绩呢？滕副司令员讲了二十年来我党建军的十点经验教训。其中最重要的是，有了党和毛主席和朱总司令的正确领导。又由于我们军队是人民的军队，发挥了“来自人民、属于人民、为了人民”的素质。在军队中建立了各种优良的制度，首先是政治工作，政治委员制度。在军队中耐心的进行了民族教育，阶级教育，因此她仍能为民族解放、人民解放事业奋不顾身的英勇斗争等等。
    最后，滕副司令员提出纪念“八一”的任务，就是要求把这支人民解放军建设得更完善，更坚强，发展正义的爱国自卫战争，坚决彻底干脆全部地消灭一切蒋介石进犯军。力求全部实现我党中央“七七”发布的十六条口号。
    接着杨主席讲话，他说：一、人民解放军的强大，是毛主席、朱总司令政治军事路线的胜利，也是各级指战员执行毛主席、朱总司令政治、军事路线的辉煌成就。应该加强学习毛主席思想，加强学习军队的军政首长贯彻执行毛主席思想的努力精神。二、深刻体会作战部队之艰苦。部队在炎天酷热中，雨雪泥泞中和敌人拚命；有时吃不到饭，买不到菜，成千成万的伤病员躺在床上。后方人员应该不仅保证前线供给，尽力支援安慰他们，还应该人人奋发百倍，加紧工作。克服任何松弛、蜕化现象，把工作做得更好，使前线有更巩固、更坚强的后方。三、做好支援前线工作。四、与土地改革生产运动结合，深入检查优军工作。尊敬军属、荣退军人，帮助他们生产建立家务。
    最后由参议会邢副议长讲话。大会至九时结束。
