Mass Education of the Masses: Consciously Practice Thrift
Wu'an Workers, Peasants, and Merchants Achieve Great Results in Saving Grain and Money

[Special Dispatch from This Newspaper] In the month and a half since the Dragon Boat Festival, the movement to conserve and prepare for famine in Wu'an County has been launched on a large scale with the slogans of "exchanging rice to save grain," "giving up smoking and alcohol," "saving one out of three (saving one day's worth of grain out of three)," "weaving one out of three," and "collecting (firewood) one out of three," achieving remarkable results. New district villages that could not live without white flour in the past now rarely eat it. Most villages have started to mix in bran and vegetables. Wasteful behaviors such as drinking alcohol and smoking cigarettes have become shameful acts that everyone condemns. Cadres at all levels, led by the county magistrate and county committee members, have all switched to smoking dry tobacco. Individual state-owned stores or cadres who fail to set an example are met with scorn from the masses, and some are even subjected to direct criticism from the masses, beginning to change their ways. In Xitongle Village, there were ten wasters (called "flood-stricken beds" by the masses). At a village meeting comparing those who "know how to live" (saving grain and money, knowing how to manage life), they could not say a single thing they did to conserve, resulting in severe criticism from the majority. The masses resolved to "no longer distribute fruits to them," "no relief, no mutual aid, we won't care if they sell their land, they deserve to starve." The wasters finally made self-criticisms, set their own disciplines, and resolved to change. Statistics from twenty villages in the tenth district south of the city show that in one month, they saved 57,000 catties of grain, and all 1,614 people who drank alcohol and smoked cigarettes quit drinking and switched to smoking dry tobacco, saving 3.39 million yuan, and prepared 64,000 catties of dried vegetables. In Chongyi Village in the eighth district, with a population of less than 2,000 (excluding young children), 423 people reduced their daily grain consumption from one catty to nine liang, 1,233 people reduced it to twelve liang, and 77 people reduced it to fourteen liang. On average, each person reduced their daily consumption by more than four liang, which was praised by the district. Statistics from Boyan Town in the third district over eighteen days show that simply by giving up smoking and alcohol, not eating in restaurants, and not giving gifts, they saved 3,571 catties of grain. On "Thrift Day" (Dragon Boat Festival), the entire county saved an average of 90,000 yuan per village, with the seventh district saving 5.8 million yuan, the eleventh district saving 4 million yuan, and the urban area, which was relatively poor, still saving 3.29 million yuan. Boyan Town in the third district alone saved 1.44 million yuan in one day. Villages have also begun to accumulate public granaries with the fruits of struggle and sideline income. Workers in Bate Village have also been saving 150 to 300 yuan per person per day to buy grain for the public granaries. It has also been widely proposed that "whoever does not engage in production and thrift will not receive relief next year." The entire county estimates that from the Dragon Boat Festival to the autumn harvest, they can save enough food and supplies for one month.

The leadership of the county, districts, and villages in this large-scale movement first overcame simply issuing orders, such as banning smoking, alcohol, meat, melons, and fruits, and instead adopted in-depth, layer-by-layer mobilization. The initial "strict bans" actually turned retail sales into secret sales, selling even faster, and bad elements took the opportunity to spread rumors: "Everything saved will be turned over to the public." This only increased resentment. Some villages, fearing that melons and fruits would rot, ate them themselves, and the masses complained that the government was cutting off their livelihoods. The leadership discovered this failure and quickly changed to a layer-by-layer ideological mobilization method: organizing large-scale recollections in each village of the suffering of famine years, recalling how many people starved to death, fled, were ruined, sold their children, and sold their property; discussing how a certain household was originally well-off but suffered hunger during famine years due to wastefulness; how a certain household was not well-off but did not suffer hunger due to frugality; specifically calculating accounts: "Switching from cigarettes to dry tobacco saves 30,000 yuan a year," "One meal of white flour can get you through three days of famine," "A bowl of cold noodles is a meal," etc., making everyone generally alert and consider the difficulties of this year: cotton is a major source of income, but most of it was not planted, or was planted and then hit by hail; grain is determined to be a poor harvest; sideline income used to account for half, but this year there are few avenues for it, and coupled with wartime conditions, war service and financial burdens are difficult to reduce. This changed the general mood of the masses. Coal mine workers, artisans, malt sugar vendors, etc., who used to be generally wasteful, after mobilization and discussion, understood that their products and skills would have greatly reduced outlets in famine years and that buying grain would be very difficult, so they began to economize on food and clothing; parents, the elderly, women, and children held meetings separately, and finally each household held a family meeting, all unanimously recognizing the seriousness of the difficulties and feeling that Chairman Mao was "afraid that us poor people would be poor again," consciously setting family plans, and the whole family was of one mind to survive the famine. Secondly, the implementation of cadres and party members taking the lead also played a decisive role. Li Qiushuan, the agricultural association committee member of He Village, and Liu Zhongting of Liu Xi Village, were both leading models. In the past, the village was unwilling to exchange cigarettes for food, but they took the lead in implementing it, and the entire village quickly followed suit.

Thirdly, it was gradually implemented according to actual conditions. For example, in villages such as Xiaohe Village, the first step in exchanging rice for food was to switch to eating rice, and the second step was to save rice and add bran and vegetables, while some villages adopted eating according to work: eating dry rice when busy and eating thinner rice when idle. There were no mechanical restrictions. As a result, the masses' initiative was even greater. (Er Dong)

    群众教育群众  自觉厉行节约
    武安工农商省米省钱成绩大
    【本报特讯】端阳节以来一月中，武安的节约备荒运动，已以换饭省米、变烟戒酒，节三余一（三天省出一天粮）、织（纺织）三余一、砍（拾砍）三余一为口号，在全县大规模推行起来，获得极显著成绩。过去天天离不了白面的新区村庄，现在很少有吃白面的了。大部村庄都已掺吃糠菜。吃酒吸纸烟等浪费行为，成了人人指责的可耻行为。各级干部以县长、县委们为首，一律改吸旱烟。个别公营商店或干部不起模范作用，都遭到群众白眼，有的受到群众正面批评，开始改变作风。西通乐村有十个浪费者（群众称他们“河涝床”），在村民比“会过”（省米省钱，会过光景）的大会上，说不出一点会过的地方来，结果受到多数人严厉批评，群众决议“不再给他们分果实”，“不救济，不互助，卖地不管，饿死活该。”浪费者最后做了检讨，自订纪律，决心转变。城南十区二十村统计，一月内省米五万七千斤，一六一四个喝酒吸纸烟的全部戒了酒，改吸旱烟，省钱三百三十九万元，打干菜六万四千斤。八区崇义全村不到两千人口，除幼儿不计外，有四二三人每天由吃一斤米减到九两，一二三三人减到十二两，七七人减到十四两。平均每人每天少吃四两以上，受到区上的表扬。三区伯延镇十八天统计，光变烟戒酒、不吃馆子、不送礼三项，省米三五七一斤。“节约节”（端阳节）一日内，全县平均每村省九万元，七区省五百八十万元，十一区省四百万元，城关较差，也省了三百二十九万元。三区仅伯延一镇一天省了一百四十四万元。各村并以斗争果实及副业所得开始积义仓，八特村工人亦已每人每日积资一百五到三百元来买粮积义仓。并普遍提出：谁不好好生产节约，明年就不救济谁。全县估计，端阳节到秋收前三月内足可省出一个月的吃用来。
    县区村对这一大规模运动的领导，首先是克服了单纯的命令行事，禁烟、禁酒、禁肉、禁瓜果等，而代以深入的层层发动。开始时的“严禁”，实际是把零卖变成暗卖，卖的更快，坏分子乘机造谣：省下都得归公。反增反感。有些村怕瓜果腐烂，都自己吃了，群众埋怨政府塞断了生财之道。领导上发现了这个失败，很快改用一层层思想发动的办法：大规模组织各村农民回忆灾荒年痛苦，回忆曾经饿死过多少人，饿跑、饿坏、卖儿女、卖产业多少人；谈论某户原很殷实，但因浪费，灾荒年挨了饿；某户并不殷实，但因会过，没有挨了饿；具体算帐：“纸烟变旱烟，一年省三万”，“一顿白面能渡三天荒”，“一碗凉粉一顿饭”等，使大家普遍警觉起来，考虑今年的困难：棉花是收入的大宗，但多没种上，或种上又被冰雹打了；粮食确定歉收；副业收入过去占一半，今年门路很少，加以战争条件，战勤与财粮负担很难减轻。这样转变了一般群众情绪。煤窑工人、手艺工人、麻糖小贩等，以前一般都浪费，经过动员讨论，都明白了自己的产品与手艺在灾荒年将大减其出路，买粮将发生许多困难，开始节衣缩食；家长、老人、妇女、儿童分头集会，最后各户开家庭会，都一致认识到困难严重，感到毛主席是“怕咱穷人再过穷哩”，自觉订定家庭计划，全家一条心渡荒。其次是实行干部与党员带头，也起了决定性的作用。和村镇的农会委员李秋拴，刘西村的刘忠亭，都是带头的模范。以前村里不肯变烟换饭，但他们首先实行了，全村即很快跟了上来。
    再次，按实际情况，逐步推行。如小贺庄等村换饭，因当地生活程度高，第一步先换成吃米，第二步才省米，加吃糠菜，有些村则采取按活吃饭：忙时吃干饭，闲时吃稀些。并不机械限制。结果群众自动性更大了。（而东）
