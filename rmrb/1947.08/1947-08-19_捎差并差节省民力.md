　　【Report from Taiyue, August 17th】 Comrade Su Wende, a clerk in the Civil Affairs Section of the Tunliu County Government, created two methods to save civilian labor during the meritorious service campaign: (1) Carrying extra goods instead of assigning missions. For example, two government vehicles from Wu Yuan were delivering military shoes, and they would be empty on the return trip. Coincidentally, there was a disabled soldier who couldn't walk and needed to go to Wu Yuan. In order to save civilian labor, Comrade Wen De conveniently arranged for this vehicle to take him back, and the Wu Yuan driver took on an additional mission. The news about them carrying extra goods was put on the blackboard newspaper, and everyone learned this method. If it's a general, sporadic mission, it is also written on the blackboard newspaper so that empty vehicles passing through each village or empty vehicles returning home can take on the mission. The government writes letters to the villages to acknowledge the missions based on the required time. (2) Combining missions and rewarding missions. For example, a vehicle from Guo Village in the First District was going to Lucheng to deliver a military dependent. Before it left, another working comrade came to request a mission to Lucheng. Comrade Wen De patiently persuaded and rewarded the driver to combine the two missions into one.

　　捎差并差节省民力
    【本报太岳十七日电】屯留县政府民政科员粟文德同志，在立功运动中创造了两种节省民力办法：（一）捎差顶差。如吾元有两个过往政府送军鞋，回时是空车，恰巧有个不能走路的残废军人要往吾元去，文德同志为节省民力，趁便让这辆车将他捎回去，吾元车夫顶了一差。他们捎差的消息上了黑板报，大家都学会了这种办法。如是一般的零星差，也写在黑板报上，让各村过路空车或赶车回家空车顶差，政府按所需时间给村写信顶差。（二）并差奖差，如一区郭村一辆车往潞城送一个军属，在他未走前又来了一个工作同志拨差往潞城去，文德同志耐心说服并奖励车夫让他将两次差并为一次。
