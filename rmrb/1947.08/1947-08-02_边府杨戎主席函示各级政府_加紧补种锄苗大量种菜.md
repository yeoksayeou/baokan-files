Border Government Chairman Yang Rong's Letter to Governments at All Levels:
    Speed Up Replanting, Weeding, and Extensive Vegetable Planting
    Comrades of government work at all levels:
    Since spring, most areas of the region have suffered from severe drought, resulting in reduced wheat harvests. Spring plowing and sowing were generally delayed. In the driest areas, sowing has not been fully completed until recently. For the region as a whole, there is no doubt that the autumn harvest will be reduced, which is a major concern. Recently, most drought-stricken areas have received rain, although the rainfall is still insufficient in some places, it is possible to sow. The Beginning of Autumn is approaching, and now is the final sowing period. We must vigorously organize and lead the masses to take advantage of the post-rain period to replant seedlings and seize the opportunity to weed and protect seedlings. We must also do everything possible to eliminate uncultivated land and utilize vacant land to plant a large number of vegetables to increase grain and vegetable production, in order to compensate for the poor harvest and overcome the famine.
    In areas where sowing has been smooth and seedlings are growing well, cadres and the masses should be reminded to avoid complacency and be vigilant, as the grain has not yet been stored and natural disasters may still strike. In the midst of intense warfare, the entire region's military and civilians are closely linked, and partial famine will affect the whole area. Therefore, every locality must take the overall situation into account and actively strive for success. In areas with good seedlings, a campaign to replant autumn vegetables should be combined with weeding and seedling protection to strive for a better harvest. It is understood that this spring, the burden of war duties has affected cultivation, and many missing seedlings have not been replanted, and uncultivated land has not been completely eliminated. Especially in the new areas, experience in organizing is lacking. This spring, sowing was often done first in good, nearby land, while distant and poor land was neglected. At present, we must take advantage of the rain to launch a full-scale attack to replant missing seedlings and eliminate uncultivated land.
    In areas where rain has just fallen and areas affected by hail, the masses may have sown several times without success, or the seedlings may have been killed by drought. The leadership must make the greatest effort to solve the specific difficulties of the masses, boost their confidence, and sow again after the rain to overcome the famine.
    In areas where rain has not fallen until now, we should continue to implement well-digging and canal-opening under possible conditions. Plant as much as possible by carrying water. "Three parts vegetables, half a year's grain" – we already have experience from 1942 and 1943. In areas where sowing has taken hold, we should protect the seedlings, apply additional fertilizer, and protect as many plants as possible. Strive to harvest more grain and vegetables to alleviate the difficulties of the famine. Remind cadres and the masses: do not think that the harvest is good in other areas and it does not matter; sufficiently estimate our transportation difficulties; sufficiently estimate the difficulty for farmers to buy grain with money; sufficiently estimate the increased consumption in the fierce patriotic self-defense counter-offensive war.
    Secondly, attention should be paid to planting alfalfa and *Dichondra repens* (planting willow and poplar) in mountainous areas, slopes, sandy land, beaches, and dikes. Land that cannot be sown should also be prepared for planting wheat, and turned over in time, so as not to miss the spring and then miss the autumn.
    In the border areas, we must vigorously implement the policy of combining land distribution, land protection, and land cultivation. Do not miss the farming season. Cultivate the land even after it has been distributed, and find ways to cultivate it even if it has not been distributed, in order to ensure that farmers receive more benefits.
    We propose that a general production inspection campaign be launched immediately throughout the region. It is of great importance to send as many cadres as possible to organize inspections. Minimize temporary assignments during the weeding and replanting period. If necessary, they can be suspended periodically. Meetings should be less frequent, and unnecessary meetings should be cancelled. Even if meetings are held in the evening, the time should not be too long, so as not to affect mass production.
    In short, we have now reached a critical juncture in agricultural production. In order to compensate for the poor harvest, overcome the famine, and support the front line in winning the counter-offensive, we must make timely and intensified efforts, think of all possible ways, and especially strengthen organization and leadership to solve the specific difficulties of the masses, in order to complete this urgent task. This year, in many areas, the struggle and achievements of the broad masses of liberated people and cadres in carrying water to replant, support, and protect seedlings are very enthusiastic and great. In addition, the achievements of Hebei-Shandong-Henan and southern Hebei in repairing dikes and controlling rivers can be said to be unprecedented. Many areas have also made great achievements in implementing the frugality and rectification of village finances. These are all worthy of praise and encouragement. We hope that government work comrades throughout the region will make more contributions to the people, improve the shortcomings in our work (such as the lack of organization and assistance to the masses in solving difficulties in some places), and be highly vigilant against the difficulties posed by famine attacks. For example, in addition to the drought that has already affected some areas, the Chiang bandits are also plotting to breach the Yellow River during the flood season. Once the Yellow River floods, what will the great plains look like?! Although southern Hebei has made significant achievements in river management, it is still necessary to be vigilant against possible floods. Fully estimate possible difficulties, prevent and strive in advance, seize the time, strengthen inspection and promotion, and implement the Central Bureau's call for production and frugality, which should be one of the keys to overcoming current difficulties. Other issues related to production and disaster preparedness, such as cooperatives, prices, and sideline occupations, are being jointly studied and discussed by various agencies in the border area, and will be discussed later.
    Please write to us at any time about the production situation in your area and any problems and suggestions you may have. With respect,
    Yang Xiufeng Rong Wusheng

    边府杨戎主席函示各级政府
    加紧补种锄苗大量种菜各级政府工作同志：
    自春以来，全区大部地区苦旱，麦已减收，春耕下种一般又迟，其亢旱地区，直至最近尚未能完全下种。就全区来说，秋收减成已无疑问，这是一件大事。最近旱区大部先后落雨，虽雨量仍有不足者，亦可能下种。立秋就到，目前已是最后播种的时候了，必须大力组织，领导群众，趁雨后补苗抢种，抓紧锄苗保苗，并尽一切可能消灭熟荒，利用隙地，大量种菜，来增产粮食和蔬菜，以补救歉收，克服灾荒。
    在业已顺利播种，青苗较好的区域，应提醒干部和群众防止自满，警惕粮食尚未入仓，天灾还可能袭来；在剧烈的战争中，全区军民息息相关，部分灾荒影响全面。因此，任何地方都要从全区着眼，积极努力。在青苗较好地区，也要与锄苗保苗相结合，再来一次补种秋菜运动，争取多收。据了解因今春战勤较多影响耕作，不少的缺苗未及补种，熟荒亦未能完全消灭了。特别是新区，组织起来的经验差，今春播种常常是尽先种好地近地，而把远地坏地忽视了。目前必须趁落了雨，再行全力突击，争取补种缺苗与消灭熟荒。
    在才落雨的区域和受冰雹灾害的区域，群众可能已播种数次还未出来；或出来又被打死旱死了。领导上必须以最大努力解决群众具体困难，提高群众信心，趁雨再种，克服灾荒。
    在至今仍未落雨的区域，则在可能条件下，继续贯彻打井开渠，能担水种上一点是一点，“三分菜半年粮”，四二、四三两年已有经验。在已播种而捉住苗者，进行保苗，加工施肥，多保一棵是一棵。争取多收一些粮食和蔬菜，减轻灾荒困难，提醒干部和群众：不要认为别的区域年景好，不要紧；要足够估计我们运输困难；足够估计农民用钱买粮食吃的困难；足够估计剧烈的爱国自卫战争反攻中消耗之增加。
    其次，要注意在山地、坡地、沙地、滩地及堤上，种苜蓿地丁（插柳栽杨）。其不能下种的地，也要准备种麦，及时翻起，万不可误了春，再误了秋。
    在边沿区要大力贯彻分田、保田、种田相结合之方针，不误农时，分了田也种上地，未分者也要设法种上，才能保证农民获得更多的利益。
    我们提议在全区立即来一个普遍的生产检查运动，尽量抽派干部组织检查，是有很大的重要性的。在锄苗抢种时期尽量减少支差，必要时可定期停止，会议要少，不必要的会停开，就是晚上开会，时间亦不能太长，以免影响群众生产。
    总之，现在已到农业生产的紧急关头，为补救歉收，克服灾荒及支援前线争取反攻胜利，必须及时加紧努力，想尽一切办法，特别要加紧组织与领导，为群众解决具体困难，以完成这一紧急任务。今年不少地区，广大翻身群众与干部担水抢种扶苗保苗的斗争与成绩是非常热烈伟大的。又如冀鲁豫与冀南之修堤治河成绩可以说是空前的。又不少地区贯彻节约整顿村财政很有成绩。这些都值得表扬和鼓励。希望全区政府工作同志更多的为人民立功，改进我们工作中所存在的缺点，（如有的地方组织及帮助群众解决困难不够等），高度警惕灾荒袭击所予我们之困难，例如除部分地区已受到之旱灾外，蒋贼还在阴谋趁大泛期间，使黄河决口，一旦黄水横流，大平原上会是什么样子？！冀南治河虽有显著成绩，然亦仍须警惕可能有的水患。充分估计可能有的困难，而预先加以防止和努力，抓紧时间，加强检查推动，贯彻中央局关于生产与节约的号召，应是当前克服困难的关键之一。其它有关生产备荒的合作社，物价、副业等等问题，边区各机关正在共同研究讨论中，俟后再谈。
    你区的生产情况和你们有何问题及意见希随时写给我们。此致敬礼
    杨秀峰  戎伍胜
    七月三十日
