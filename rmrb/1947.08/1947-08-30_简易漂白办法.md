Simple Bleaching Method

[Our Correspondent in Shahe Reports] Women in villages near the ferry crossing are popularizing a method for bleaching homespun cloth that is both economical and simple. The results are even whiter than using bleaching powder. The method is described below: Mix cow dung with water in a night soil bucket to form a thin slurry. Soak white cloth or white clothing in it for half a day. When you take it out, it will have turned a yellowish-brown color. Take it to the river to wash, then spread it out on a grassy slope to dry, then wash and dry it again. When you see the cloth is white, you are done. It is best to wash in the morning and evening, and after washing, place it on the grassy slope so the dew can soak it, which will make the cloth even whiter. Generally, washing and drying three or four times will do the trick. (Kuí Lín)

　　简易漂白办法
    【本报沙河讯】渡口一带村庄妇女流行着一种漂白土布的办法，既省钱又简单，漂出来比经过漂白粉的还要白，现在介绍如下：用牛粪放进圊罐加水搅拌成稀汤，把白布或白色衣裳放进，沤少半天，取出来就成一种黄褐色，拿到河里去洗，洗后放在青草坡上晒干再洗再晒，看着布白了就可以。最好是早晨和傍晚洗，洗后放在草坡上，被露水一潮，布就更白，一般洗晒三、四次就成功了。（奎林）
