[Comprehensive Xinhua News Agency dispatches from the 6th to the 8th] Dutch imperialists have violated the ceasefire and continue to invade the Republic of Indonesia, launching new offensives in Java and Sumatra on the 5th.

After the Security Council issued a note to both Indonesia and the Netherlands regarding an immediate ceasefire, the Indonesian government issued an official statement on the 3rd, presenting the following solemn response to the Security Council's decision: (1) The Republic considers the Security Council's decision to be a manifestation of the United Nations' adherence to the ideals and principles of the Charter, and believes that the decision is a first attempt to end the conflict. (2) In view of past experiences between the two armies, the Republic believes that it is extremely important for the Dutch army to withdraw from the Indonesian islands. (3) Arbitration must be conducted under the supervision of the Security Council, and the Security Council should appoint several countries agreed upon by both Indonesia and the Netherlands to carry out the arbitration. (4) In order to ensure the smooth and fair implementation of the Security Council's mission, the Republic believes it is necessary to send representatives to fully explain the Republic's views to the Security Council. (5) The Republic believes that the ceasefire can only take effect after both sides have withdrawn their forces to the demarcation line stipulated on October 14, 1946. (6) The Republic sincerely hopes that all freedom-loving and peace-loving countries in the world will make every effort to stop the Dutch colonial aggression.

The Dutch authorities also expressed their agreement with the Security Council's ceasefire decision at the time. However, before the Security Council had made a specific decision on what kind of arbitration method to use to resolve the dispute, they colluded with the United States and actively lobbied for the United States to come forward alone to "mediate," plotting to prevent the Security Council from directly handling the matter, so that the arbitration results would be favorable to the Dutch side. Dutch Ambassador to the United States Kleffens told reporters after meeting with U.S. Deputy Secretary of State Lovett on the 3rd that the Netherlands had accepted the U.S. "mediation" terms. The United States also abruptly instructed its Consul General in Indonesia, Foote, on the 5th, to suggest "mediation" to the Indonesian government. According to a broadcast by Dutch radio on the 6th, the Netherlands and the United States will hold talks in the capitals of the two countries in the near future to discuss the U.S. proposal for "mediation" to resolve the Indonesian issue.

According to a dispatch from Batavia on the 4th, although the Dutch government has decided to cease fire, it will not make an explicit provision on its control over Indonesia as soon as possible, implying that it does not intend to immediately withdraw from the territories it has occupied since the outbreak of the war; moreover, it does not have the sincerity to cease fire. The Dutch side declared a ceasefire on the 4th, but then arbitrarily violated it and occupied several towns and cities on the Indonesian islands. According to an Indonesian government communique on the 6th, the Dutch army has successively occupied Genwang and Demak; after the ceasefire order took effect at midnight on the same day, part of the Dutch army continued to advance northeast of Semarang and occupied Karanganyar, 40 miles east of Cilacap. After occupying the cities, the Dutch army also entered the countryside to carry out brutal "mopping-up operations." On the day the ceasefire order was issued, the Dutch naval and land forces commander made a provocative speech, clamoring that "the law and order must be maintained." It is reported that Dutch reinforcements are on their way to Indonesia. Indonesian Vice President Hatta delivered a speech in Sumatra, exposing the illegal acts of the Dutch army, and declared: In order to comply with the wishes of the United Nations, we must avoid war. But if the Dutch army attacks us, we will definitely fight back. He insisted that the Dutch army retreat to the position before October 14, 1946; otherwise, the Dutch side should be fully responsible for the consequences of the war.

In view of the Dutch side's breach of faith and its use of the ceasefire order to deploy new offensives, the Indonesian government issued a new instruction on the 6th from the Ministry of Interior, ordering Indonesian administrative personnel in the Dutch-occupied areas to continue to be loyal to the motherland and not to cooperate with the Dutch side. It also declared that Indonesia does not recognize any other local governments in Java or Sumatra except those established by the Republic of Indonesia. At the same time, the Indonesian side has telegraphed the Security Council to send representatives to supervise the implementation of the ceasefire order.

[Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 6th] Reports from various sources: Workers and youth around the world are rising up to support Indonesia with action. Workers in many cities in the Netherlands are still persisting in their strikes. Following the general strike of dock workers in Rotterdam in late July, more than 6,000 workers in cities such as Amsterdam and Groningen have successively joined the strike. The majority of doctors and workers in Rotterdam are acting in unison to protest the Dutch government's launch of a war of aggression. On August 2nd, an incident occurred in Bombay, India, where workers refused to load and unload Dutch ships, forcing the ship to dock in Bombay and unable to sail to Indonesia. When a Dutch ship transporting 2,000 troops and munitions was about to dock in Port Said, Egyptian workers and youth expressed great indignation, and the workers resolutely called for a strike. Egyptian progressive public opinion also demanded that the Egyptian government prohibit Dutch ships and military aircraft from passing through Egyptian territory. The World Federation of Trade Unions, a progressive workers' organization, and the World Federation of Democratic Youth (including 3.5 million Indonesian members), representing progressive youth from various countries, have called on democratic youth and workers in the Netherlands and around the world to do everything possible to stop the Dutch government's atrocities, and have called for raising money and medicine to support Indonesia.

[Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 5th] New York News: The US policy of attempting to independently "mediate" the Indonesian-Dutch war reflects the interests of US financial oligarchs in Indonesia. Before World War II, US capital activity in Indonesia was already considerable. Today, the power of Dutch and British capitalists has been weakened, and the United States is taking advantage of this opportunity to pursue an expansionist policy in Indonesia. "Mobil Oil Company" owns more than 500 oil wells and a considerable amount of underground storage in Sumatra. The US "Goodrich Tire Company" and "United Rubber Company" each own more than 200,000 acres of rubber plantations. According to a report by Anita News Agency on December 1st last year, "Mobil Company" is planning to build a large oil refinery worth millions of US dollars in Sumatra. Representatives of some large US companies have suggested to transportation officials of the Indonesian government to "rebuild the Indonesian transportation network." The United States also profits greatly from trade with Indonesia. According to the "Foreign Commerce Weekly," a publication of the US Department of Commerce on July 19th, US goods accounted for 31% of the total imports in the Dutch-occupied areas of Indonesia in January this year. At the same time, 27% of the exports from these areas were shipped to the United States. According to the "World Report" statistics on July 15th this year, the total US investment in Indonesia is 500 million US dollars. The publication pointed out that US monopoly capital will play a more active role in Indonesia.

Moreover, the collusion between US and Dutch imperialism in Indonesia has been conclusively proven. The Dutch government is currently plundering a large amount of rubber, sugar, food, and other materials from Indonesia. According to a report in the Hague's Handelszet newspaper, 300,000 rubber stolen by the Dutch in Cirebon are awaiting shipment to the United States. It is also reported that US imperialism is planning to lend money to the Netherlands; Andrew and Ruth Dillerson, presidents of the Indonesian Association organized by American progressives, have protested to the US "World Bank."

[Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 3rd] Moscow News: Lieutenant Colonel Khrisanov commented on the Indonesian war in Red Star, saying: The Indonesian war has been expanding, with the Netherlands invading Indonesia with 120,000 officers and soldiers. The Dutch army's military technology and equipment are far superior to the Indonesian army's, and they have naval support. The Indonesian army has only 200,000 men and lacks modern weapons and equipment, but their hatred for the enslavers is deep. Even with only rudimentary weapons, they are brave in battle and receive enthusiastic support from the people. At present, the development of guerrilla warfare is making the Dutch army feel uneasy in the rear. The Netherlands has received large-scale assistance from Britain and the United States and is trying to defeat the Indonesian people's resistance in the short term. But the Indonesian army, which is on high alert, has blocked the enemy's offensive and counterattacked, and the war is obviously dragging on. Khrisanov concluded: "The Indonesian people's resistance to the Dutch invaders is becoming more organized. The Netherlands has no ability to wage a protracted war against 70 million Indonesians."

　　荷破坏停战令继续侵犯印尼
  　印尼军民决予反击
    世界工人青年奋起以行动支援印尼
    【综合新华社六日至八日电讯】荷兰帝国主义者破坏停战令，继续向印尼共和国进犯，于五日开始在爪哇、苏门答腊各地发动新的攻势。
    安理会致印荷双方关于立即停战的照会发表后，印尼政府曾于三日发布官方声明，对安理会之决定提出下列严正答复：（一）共和国视安理会之决定系联合国坚守宪章之理想与原则的表现，并认为该决定系对结束冲突之初次尝试。（二）鉴于过去两军之经验，共和国认为荷军由印尼各岛撤退，至为重要。（三）仲裁须在安理会监督下进行，由安理会指派若干经印荷双方同意的国家，执行仲裁事宜。（四）为顺利及公正地执行安理会之任务起见，共和国认为有派遣代表之必要，以便在安理会上充分解释共和国之意见。（五）共和国认为停战只有在双方武力均撤至一九四六年十月十四日规定之分界线后，始能生效。（六）共和国真诚地希望世界爱好自由、和平的国家，尽一切努力制止荷兰之殖民地侵略。
    荷兰当局方面，当时也表示同意安理会的停战决定。惟在安理会尚未具体决定采取何种仲裁方式解决双方争端以前，则与美方狼狈为奸，积极活动，图由美国出面单独“斡旋”，阴谋阻碍安理会直接处理此事件，以便仲裁结果有利于荷方。荷兰驻美大使克利芬斯于三日晤美副国务卿罗维特后，对记者表示荷兰已接受美方“斡旋”条件。美国并突于五日指令其驻印尼总领事佛特，向印尼政府建议进行“调解”。另据荷兰电台六日广播称：荷兰与美国将于日内在两国首都举行会谈，讨论美国“斡旋”解决印尼问题的建议。
    又据巴达维亚四日电：荷政府虽决定停战，但对其在印尼的控制权，将不作尽速的明文规定，暗示其尚不拟立即退出其于战争爆发以来所侵占的领土；而且并没有停战的诚意。荷方在四日宣称停战，但随即任意破坏，并侵占印尼各岛若干城镇。据印尼政府六日公报称：荷军已先后占领根望、德马克；当日午夜停战令生效后，荷军一部仍向三宝珑东北继续推进，并侵占了芝拉扎以东四十里的加郎阿涅尔。荷军于占领城市后并进入农村进行残暴的“清剿”。停战令颁布之日，荷海陆军司令就作了挑拨性的演说，扬言“必须继续维持法律与治安”。据息，荷兰增援部队正在开赴印尼途中。印尼副总统哈达在苏岛发表演说，揭露荷军违法行为，宣称：为符合联合国之愿望，我们必须避免战争。但荷军进攻我们，我们一定予以反击。他坚持要求荷军退至一九四六年十月十四日以前的位置；否则，战争后果应由荷方负全责。
    印尼政府鉴于荷方背信弃义、利用停战令布置新的进攻，特于六日由内政部发布新的指令，命在荷占领区之印尼行政人员，继续效忠祖国，不得与荷方合作。并宣称：除由印尼共和国建立者外，印尼一概不承认在爪哇或苏门答腊之其他地方政府。同时，印尼方面已电促安理会派遣代表监督停战令之执行情况。
    【新华社陕北六日电】各方讯：世界工人与青年，以行动奋起支援印尼。荷兰许多城市的工人仍坚持罢工，继鹿特丹码头工人于上月下旬全体罢工之后，阿姆斯特丹及罗尼根等城市，先后已有六千余名工人参加罢工。鹿特丹大多数医生与工人一致行动，以抗议荷政府发动侵略战争。八月二日，印度发生孟买工人拒绝装卸荷轮的事件，迫使该轮停泊孟买港口，不能开赴印尼。当荷轮运输二千名军队及军火行将泊抵塞得港时，埃及工人和青年表示极大愤慨，工人们坚决号召罢工。埃及进步舆论亦纷纷要求埃政府禁止荷轮及荷军用机假道埃境。世界进步的工人组织世界职工联盟和代表各国进步青年的世界民主青年联盟（包括三百五十万印尼会员），均要求荷兰和全世界的民主青年和工人竭尽所能制止荷兰政府暴行，并号召募集金钱药品支援印尼。
    【新华社陕北五日电】纽约讯：美国企图单独“调停”印荷战争的政策，反映出美国金融寡头在印尼的利益。到第二次世界大战前，美国资本在印尼的活动已颇可观。今天，荷英资本家的力量削弱了，美国更利用此机会在印尼进行扩张政策。“美孚汽油公司”在苏门答腊拥有五百多油井和相当多的地下贮藏，美国的“古德立轮胎公司”及“合众树胶公司”各拥有二十万英亩以上的胶园。据去年十二月一日安尼塔通讯社报导，“美孚公司”正计划在苏岛建筑价值数百万美金的大煤油厂。美国一些大公司的代表曾向印尼政府交通官员建议“重建印尼交通网”。在对印尼贸易方面，美国也获厚利。据七月十九日美国商业部机关报“国外商业周刊”载称：今年一月间，印尼荷占领区总入口中美货占百分之三十一。同时，这些地区的出口货中有百分之二十七输往美国。根据“世界报导”今年七月十五日的统计，美国在印尼的投资总数为五亿元。该刊物指出：美国独占资本将在印尼扮演更活跃的角色。
    又，美荷帝国主义在印尼狼狈为奸之勾当，已证据确凿。荷兰政府现正从印尼掠夺大批树胶、糖、食料及其他物资，据海牙的韩特尔塞特报报导：荷兰在井里汶劫走之三十万树胶，正在待运赴美。又息：美帝国主义又拟向荷兰贷款；美国进步人士组织的印度尼西亚协会主席安都及律尔德尔逊，已向美“世界银行”提出抗议。
    【新华社陕北三日电】莫斯科讯：赫里珊诺夫中校于红星报著论评印尼战争称：印尼战争已日益扩大，有荷兰以十二万官兵侵犯印尼，荷军军事技术与装备之优良远甚于印尼军，且有海军支援。印尼军只二十万人，并缺乏现代化之武器与装备，但他们对奴役者的仇恨很深，虽只携带简陋武器亦勇于战斗，并得到人民热烈的支援。目前，由于游击战争的开展，使荷军不得不感到后方不安。荷兰从英美接到大规模援助，并正在试图于短期内击破印尼人民的抵抗。但严阵以待的印尼军已阻制了敌军的进攻，并予以反击，战争显然拖延着。赫里珊诺夫结语称：“印尼人民对荷兰进犯者的抵抗，正在更有组织化，荷兰决无能力对七千万印展人民作持久战。”
