    Xinhua News Agency, Northwest, 5th—Tang Hongcheng, Deputy Director of the Civil Affairs Department of the Shaanxi-Gansu-Ningxia Border Region Government, stated to reporters upon his return a few days ago that he represented the Border Region Government in visiting and providing disaster relief to the various recovered areas, a journey that lasted three months, saying: The Jiang-Hu bandit troops implemented an utterly inhumane "three-all policy" during their "mopping-up" operations in June, leaving nothing but ruins wherever they went. The massive losses suffered by the people of the border region are impossible to calculate at the moment. In ten small villages near Long'an Town, totaling just over a hundred households, more than 220 dan of grain were looted. In the Peijia District of Zizhou (formerly Shuanghuyu) County, out of 700 laborers in six townships, the enemy abducted 220 people. In the second and sixth townships of that district, out of more than 1,300 households, the enemy stole more than 3,300 head of livestock, an average loss of three head per household. In addition to the various special commissioner's offices and county governments distributing emergency relief, I personally allocated and distributed more than 1,170 shi of grain from the Border Region Government to provide relief wherever I went. To solve the people's difficulties with daily necessities, local governments have organized public and private commerce, restored markets, organized labor exchange and production, rushed to harvest the new wheat, and mobilized women and children to collect the grain scattered on the ground by the Jiang enemy. They have also organized the masses to bury the corpses of enemy soldiers and livestock to prevent infectious diseases. Most moving is the mutual assistance and relief among the masses. The people of nine counties in the Yan'an-Suide district alone mutually adjusted 6,186 shi of food grain, 586 shi of seeds, 7,080 pieces of farm implements, and more than 4,000 labor days, fully demonstrating the spirit of high unity and mutual assistance among the people of the border region. At present, the people in various places are launching a movement to join the army and seek revenge, and the blood debts owed by the Jiang-Hu bandits will be repaid in double.

    陕甘宁边府拨粮千余石
    救济新收复区灾民
    【新华社西北五日电】陕甘宁边府民政厅唐洪澄副厅长于四月初，代表边府前往各收复区慰问与救济灾民，历时三个月，于日前归来时语记者称：蒋胡匪军在六月“清剿”中施行绝灭人性的“七光政策”，所到之处卢舍为墟，边区人民所受损失之巨，一时无法统计。龙安镇附近总共仅百余户的十个小村庄，即被抢去粮食二百二十余担，子洲（原双湖峪）县裴家区六乡共有七百个劳力，敌即拉去二百二十人，该区二、六两乡一千三百余户中即被敌抢走牲畜三千三百余头。平均每户损失三头。除各专署县府分头急救外，本人所到之处，亲由边府拨粮一千一百七十余石分发救济。为解决人民日用品困难，各地政府已组织公私商业，恢复市集，组织变工、生产，抢收新麦，并动员妇孺收检蒋敌抛撤地面之粮食，组织群众掩埋敌军及牲畜尸体以预防传染病。最令人感动者为群众互助救济，仅延属分区九个县人民的互相调剂食粮六千一百八十六石，种籽五百八十六石，农具七千零八十件，畜工四千余个，充分发扬边区人民高度团结互助的友爱精神。现各地人民正展开参军复仇运动，蒋胡匪徒积欠的血债必将加倍清偿。
