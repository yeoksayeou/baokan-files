[This newspaper's Jinnan correspondent reports on the 29th] The Jinnan Plain, Chengci, Gaotang and other newly liberated districts are conducting re-investigations. In Chengci, after the mass movement last year, the landlords were not thoroughly overthrown. In Xiaoguozhuang in the Sixth District, thirteen landlord and rich peasant households still retain 1,000 mu of land, and some even have communal well-fields (some have six or seven mu of communal well-fields per person). In Daodongbao in the First District, the landlord Chen Lao made sarcastic remarks to the masses: "You think you've been emancipated! You can't even afford a cow leg. I'll push out a few mu of sandy land, and keep the good land." The peasants urgently demanded a thorough emancipation. Re-investigations are being carried out in more than twenty villages, including Sun'er Camp and Wangjia Village in the Fifth District. At a meeting of more than 500 people in Chengci Dongguan, the traitor landlord Li Shikui was overthrown. Each village cleared out the landlords' hidden wealth and weapons, including two rifles in Wujia Village and six rifles in Xiaoguozhuang. The hidden wealth, converted at market prices, totaled 2.74 million yuan. In addition, there were 160 houses, about 3,000 jin of wheat, and five waterwheels. During the re-investigation in Pingyuan, although the landlords were generally struggled against once, there were still loopholes and incomplete phenomena. The First District convened a meeting of activists from 103 villages, with a total of more than 520 people attending, to review the emancipation. At the meeting, the method of comparing food and clothing was used to identify 226 landlords who had slipped through the net, and 203 who should be struggled against again. A total of more than 600 targets were identified. The Fourth District trained 1,000 hired and poor peasants, and found more than 80 landlords in 57 villages who had not been thoroughly struggled against. Of the 72 villages in the Fourth District of Gaotang, 60 have been mobilized.

    检查漏网地主
    【本报冀南廿九日电】冀南平原、成磁、高唐等新区进行复查。成磁去年群运大动后，地主没被彻底打垮，六区小郭庄十三户地主、富农，尚留地千亩且有一部井田（有的每人合井田六七亩）。一区道东堡，地主陈老向群众说风凉话：“你还翻身哩！连条牛腿还买不起，我推出几亩沙地，留下净成好地。”农民迫切要求翻透身，五区孙二营、王家庄等二十余村庄普遍进行复查，成磁东关五百余人的大会上，斗倒汉奸地主郦士奎。各村清算出地主浮财及武器，计武家庄大枪两支，小郭庄大枪六支，浮财按市价折合，即合洋二百七十四万元。另外房子一百六十间、麦子约三千斤、水车五辆。平原复查时，虽普遍把地主斗了一遍，但仍有漏网和不彻底现象。一区召开一百零三个村的积极分子会，共到五百二十多人，检查翻身。会上以比比吃、比比穿的方法检查出漏网地主二百二十六个，应重斗的二百零三个。共计查出该斗的六百多个对象。四区集训一千名雇贫农，检查出五十七个村未斗彻底的地主八十多个。高唐四区七十二村中，已发动起六十村。
