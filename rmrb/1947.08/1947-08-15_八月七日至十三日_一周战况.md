　　August 7th to 13th
  　Weekly Battle Situation
    Good news this week first came from the Northwest battlefield. Part of our Northwest People's Liberation Army launched an offensive against the Yulin-Hengshan area from the 6th to the 9th, successively capturing important towns such as Hengshan and Xiangshuibao, and capturing over 3,600 enemy troops including Zhang Ziying, the deputy commander of the Shaanxi-Gansu-Ningxia Border Region Garrison, and regimental commander Zhou Xiaowu, forcing the enemy in Yulin to be trapped in an isolated city, completely isolated. On the 6th, the traitor Chiang Kai-shek flew to Yan'an, lingered for two days, and amidst the People's Liberation Army's devastating annihilation of the Chiang army around Yulin, he flew back to Xi'an in dismay to discuss defense matters with Hu Zongnan, vividly portraying a scene of utter embarrassment.
    On the Southwestern Shandong battlefield, the Chiang army is exhausting every ounce of energy, cobbling together broken copper and scrap iron in an attempt to reverse the decline, including garrison troops from Sichuan, and even the Youth Army, which is just for show, has been drawn in to fill the ranks, demonstrating Chiang Kai-shek's predicament of cutting flesh to mend sores. This large hodgepodge is now under the command of Gu Zhutong and Sun Zhen. According to the Central News Agency's boasting, it is intended to "pincer attack" General Liu Bocheng's southward crossing army in the area. The Chiang army's XX Company Central News Agency has gone to great lengths here, fabricating a series of victories on paper, such as "the remnant bandits have collapsed," and even "fleeing to the north bank of the Yellow River," etc., blowing their own horns to make up for their inadequacy. The Central News Agency's telegram to Xuzhou on the 8th, in a boastful manner, bragged about "closing the southern gateway of this triangular area, forcing the 'remnant bandits' to retreat to the predetermined area for annihilation," but the Central News Agency's telegram from Kaifeng on the 10th said that "six brigades of Liu Bocheng's troops have scurried to the area south of Cao County." The Central News Agency slapping itself in the face is not the main problem, but the real issue is that spreading rumors cannot save Chiang Kai-shek's military crisis.
    In reality, Chiang Kai-shek's method of salvaging the defeat is still to focus on flooding the Yellow River. Since the Yellow River rose at the end of last month, the Chiang planes and Chiang army Chiang secret agents have bombed and destroyed the dyke works in the Liberated Areas even more frequently and fiercely. The famous dangerous Yellow River projects of Jiangsu Dam, Zhong＠dui and other dangerous projects, which are under repair by the people of the Liberated Areas on the south bank of the Yellow River, are bombed and destroyed day and night by Chiang planes and Chiang secret agents. According to incomplete statistics last month, the dyke of our Bohai District was bombed by as many as ninety-seven Chiang planes a total of twenty-nine times, to the point that Xiaoshen Temple and other places in Kenli have been breached. In order to finally secure a glimmer of life for millions of people along the river, the spokesman of General Liu Bocheng's front-line headquarters solemnly declared on the 4th that military activities would be suspended in the seventy-mile stretch of Chiang army-occupied territory from Dongming to Linpu, and notified the local Chiang army not to obstruct the people's freedom to rush to repair the dykes. However, in recent days, the Chiang planes' bombing of the dykes, coordinated with the Chiang army's sneak attacks on the river dykes to obstruct rescue efforts, has only intensified. However, playing with the Yellow River will not save Chiang Kai-shek's dog life. Chiang's bandit's creation of this monstrous crime will further incite the soldiers and civilians in the Liberated Areas to fight to accelerate the end of Chiang Kai-shek's rule.
    The Chiang army's key offensive in central Shandong has now proven to have a rather tragic ending. The East China People's Liberation Army annihilated 9,000 Chiang army troops in the Donglidian to Nanma line (7,000 reported the previous day), and after killing Tan Daoshan, the brigade commander of the main force 11th Division 18th Brigade (not previously identified), from July 24th to 30th, they bravely counterattacked the troops of Changyi and a certain county invading south along the Jiaoji Railway in Linqu County and annihilated the entire 2nd Regiment of the 103rd Brigade of the Chiang army's direct line 8th Division, more than 7,000 people. This is the Linqu battle that the Central News Agency dreamed of as the "turning point of the Shandong war situation." In total, since the Chiang army launched a renewed offensive in central Shandong in early June, in addition to chasing shadows everywhere, about 40,000 people have been annihilated, one brigade commander has been killed, and one brigade commander has been captured (Zhai Feng was captured in Feixian and killed by Chiang army's own planes when he was being transferred). The Chiang army's key offensive has been repeatedly hit hard and is now showing signs of weakening.
    In coordination with the victorious counterattack of the People's Liberation Army in central Shandong, the Northern Jiangsu People's Liberation Army launched an offensive along the Tongyu Highway from Dongtai to Yancheng on the 6th and 7th, capturing five places including Wu＠, a major town south of Yancheng, annihilating more than 1,500 Chiang army troops, and capturing a Chiang army regimental commander alive.
    In the Jin-Cha-Ji area, the Chiang army once harassed central Hebei, vainly attempting to contain and attract the People's Liberation Army's forces, and reverse the crisis of the Chiang army in the Northeast and South lines, but under the calm struggle of the soldiers and civilians in central Hebei, the Chiang army's plan completely failed. After driving out the Chiang army from the heart of central Hebei, the People's Liberation Army recovered the two cities of Dingxian and Wangdu in one day. The Chiang army fled to Baoding in panic. So far, except for Fangshun Bridge southwest of Baoding, all the towns occupied by the Chiang army this time have been recovered by the People's Liberation Army.
    On the Northeast battlefield, there were no major battles this week, but the panic and shake-up of the Chiang army in the Northeast is increasing day by day. Chiang army soldiers are defecting one after another, and Chiang army officers are startled by the slightest sound after suffering a major defeat. Therefore, Chen Cheng and others went to Fanyang to hold a large meeting, and the American imperialist executioner Wedemeyer also personally attended to give guidance, but Wedemeyer immediately made a statement, admitting that "Chiang Kai-shek is facing the crisis of completely losing the Northeast."
    The war reports received this week show the activity of local military groups and mass guerrilla warfare in various places. The Taiyue local troops recovered Xiangling (July 30) and Jiexian (August 7). In the anti-grain grabbing struggle in the Jin-Sui area, local military groups also achieved the result of annihilating 2,000 enemies.
    The last exciting news is that two columns of the People's Liberation Army were officially established on the East China front on August 1. This people's army has the East River Column, which was famous and outstanding in the Anti-Japanese War, as its backbone. They have formulated a military establishment declaration, vowing to fight all the way to Guangdong and Guangxi, liberate North China, and liberate all of China.

### 八月七日至十三日　一周战况

　　八月七日至十三日
  　一周战况
    本周内捷报首自西北战场传来，我西北人民解放军一部，自六日起迄九日止向榆横地区发动攻势，连克横山、乡水堡等重要城镇，俘敌陕北警备副司令张子英及团长周效武以下三千六百余人，迫使榆林之敌困踞孤城，完全陷于孤立。卖国贼蒋介石六日曾飞往延安，徘徊两日，于解放军痛歼榆林外围蒋军之中，黯然飞回西安与胡宗南商中防务，活现一副狼狈相。
    鲁西南战场，蒋军正用尽吃奶气力，将破铜烂铁都凑合拢来企图挽回颓势，包括四川的守备部队，甚至以装饰门面的青年军也被抽来充数，可见蒋介石割肉补疮的窘态。这一大杂拌现统治顾祝同、孙震指挥，据中央社的吹嘘，说是要在该地区来钳击”刘伯承将军的南渡大军云云。蒋军××公司中央社会在此煞费苦心，大造了一连串纸上的胜利，诸如“残匪已溃不成军”呀，乃至“向黄河北岸溃窜”呀等等，牛皮不一补足。八日的中央给徐州电，在大言不惭，吹什么“封闭该三角地区之南方门户，压迫‘残匪’退集预定地区就歼”，但是十日中央社开封电，却说的是“刘伯承部六个旅已窜抵曹县以南地区”了。中央社自己打耳光还不要紧，成问题的倒是造谣救不了蒋介石的军事危机。
    实际上，蒋介石挽救败局的办法，还是倾心于泛滥黄河。从上月底黄河涨水后，蒋机和蒋军蒋特对解放区堤工的轰炸破坏就更加频繁猛烈。黄河南岸解放区人民正在抢修中的著名黄河大险工江苏坝、仲＠堆等险工，昼夜遭蒋机蒋特破坏轰炸。我渤海区大堤据上月不完全统计，轰炸之蒋机即有九十七架共二十九次之多，以至垦利之肖神庙等地已被炸决口。为最后争取沿河数百万人民的一线生机计，刘伯承将军前线司令部发言人曾于四日郑重声明在东明至临濮七十里蒋军占领地段，停止军事活动，并照会当地蒋军勿得妨碍人民自由抢修。但连日以来，蒋机的炸堤配合着蒋军的偷袭河堤妨碍抢救，正有加无已。然而玩弄黄河救不了蒋介石的狗命，蒋贼制造这一滔天罪行，将更激起解放区军民为加速结束蒋介石统治而奋斗。
    蒋军在鲁中的重点进攻现在证明下场颇惨，华东解放军在东里店至南麻一线，消灭蒋军九千（前日报七千），并击毙蒋军主力十一师十八旅旅长谭道善（前未查明）后，七月二十四日至三十日又于胶济线临濮城来奋勇反击昌乐、某县南犯军已歼灭蒋军嫡系第八师一○三旅二团整团七千余人，这就是中央社梦呓为“山东战局转折点”的临朐之战。总计蒋军自六月一旬在鲁中发动重返进攻以来，除到处扑空外，被歼约四万人，被击毙旅长一，被俘旅长一（翟封在费县被俘后，转送时被蒋军自己的飞机炸死），蒋军重点进攻连遭打击，目前已呈再衰三竭之势了。
    配合鲁中解放军的胜利反击，苏北解放军于六日至七日沿通榆公路东台至盐城发动攻势，攻克盐城南重镇伍＠等五处，消灭蒋军一千五百余人，生俘蒋军团长一名。
    晋察冀方面，蒋军曾出扰冀中，妄想牵制吸引解放军兵力，挽转东北与南线蒋军危机，但在冀中军民沉着奋战下，蒋军计划全部落空。解放军于逐出冀中腹地蒋军后，一日收复定县、望都二城，蒋军仓惶向保定逃窜。至此，除保定西南之方顺桥外，蒋军此次所占各城镇，全部为解放军收复。
    东北战场，本周无大战事，然而东北蒋军的恐慌动摇，则与日倍增，蒋军士兵投诚者接踵而至，而蒋军军官在大败之余，草木皆兵。于是陈诚等到藩阳大开其会，美帝国主义刽子手魏德迈也亲自出席指导一番，但魏德迈旋即发表谈话，自供“蒋介石已面临完全丧失东北的危机”了。
    本周所得战报，显示各地地方兵团及群众性游击战之活跃，太岳地方部队收复襄陵（七月三十日）与解县（八月七日）。晋绥方面地方兵团，在反抢粮斗争中，也收到歼敌两千的战果。
    最后一个令人兴奋的消息，即是人民解放军两个纵队已于八月一日在华东前线正式成立。这一支人民的军队是由抗日战争中英名卓著的东江纵队为其骨干，他们已制出建军宣言，誓为一直打到两广，解放华北，解放全中国而奋斗到底。
