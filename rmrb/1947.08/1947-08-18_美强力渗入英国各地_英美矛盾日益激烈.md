Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 13th: "America is Launching a Major Offensive Against the British Empire," this is how Soviet writer Lemin depicts the Anglo-American contradiction. Lemin pointed out: American monopoly capitalists, using anti-Sovietism as a smokescreen, are penetrating all parts of Britain from three aspects: economic, political, and military. In the Middle East, the United States is intensifying its expansion; in Canada, the United States has already regarded it as the twenty-second country of the Pan-American Alliance; in India, it is particularly concerned about the small kingdom of Nepal and has recognized its independence; in the South Pacific, it demands the islands of Australia and New Zealand as bases. The economic unity of the British Empire, established by the Imperial Preference System, is under a general attack by the United States. Britain has decided that it must increase exports by at least 75 percent, otherwise, its income and expenditure will not be balanced. However, the United States insists on abolishing the preferential system, or at least reducing its scope, because the countries belonging to the British Empire expanded trade with the United States during the war. The United States not only wants to maintain these markets but also strives to squeeze Britain out of these markets. Under such circumstances, it is no wonder that British newspapers and members of parliament are clamoring to protect the preferential system which is related to the life and death of the British Empire. British progressive democrats, and even some Conservative politicians, also oppose the policy of certain Anglo-American monopoly groups handing over Britain to the control of American capital.
Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 13th: Moscow News: Viktorov, a diplomatic commentator for Pravda, commented on Attlee's statement in the British House of Commons on the 6th, saying: The pile of figures cited by Attlee proved that the US loan to Britain a year ago did not alleviate the British economic situation but, due to the implementation of the loan conditions, the result was like a noose around the neck of the British national economy, and it is getting tighter and tighter. After analyzing the various harsh conditions of the US loan, the author stated: It is not difficult to see that the American creditor is trying to make his debtor obey him to the greatest extent possible, and to make the loan a tool of powerful economic and political pressure. The author continued: Attlee wants to appease his masses with the prospect that the United States has agreed to modify the loan conditions, but this prospect is quite doubtful. Marshall told reporters on the 6th that the terms of the loan to Britain might be eased and could be implemented without congressional approval. However, US Treasury Secretary Snyder immediately denied Marshall's claim that it could be passed without Congress. American newspapers said: Britain is carefully exaggerating its difficulties in order to obtain new loans from the United States as compensation for concessions in the Ruhr negotiations. Therefore, the first comment from the United States on Attlee's speech stated that Attlee's attempt to soften the hard-hearted American creditors with his speech did not succeed. However, the unintended purpose of the leaders of British policy, that is, the reverse side of Anglo-American "friendship," was revealed to world public opinion.
Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 13th: According to TASS on the 10th, citing American newspaper opinions, it confirms that the United States is arrogantly interfering in Britain politically and economically. The New York Times stated: "Britain has so far been emphasizing its weakness and lack, and people who have visited Washington have repeatedly stated that Britain should first produce enough necessities before implementing industrial nationalization." The newspaper revealed: "Washington officials are using Britain's difficulties to force British policy to turn further to the right." The New York Herald Tribune stated that Clayton will go to London with the Australian Reconstruction Minister Derman to meet with British Minister of Commerce Cripps to discuss the US "aid to Britain" problem, conditional on Britain completely abolishing imperial preferences. The afternoon newspaper wrote in another arrogant manner: "Britain's economic difficulties are largely due to the maintenance of a huge army. Although the Labor government was elected with an anti-imperialist program, it still attempts to maintain imperialist ambitions that are far beyond Britain's ability." implying that Britain should give its position that is "far beyond its ability" to the United States.

### 美强力渗入英国各地　英美矛盾日益激烈

　　美强力渗入英国各地
  　英美矛盾日益激烈
    【新华社陕北十三日电】莫斯科讯：“美国大举进攻大英帝国”，这是苏联作家列明对美英矛盾的描画。列明指出：美国垄断资本家以反苏作为烟幕，从经济政治与军事三方面渗入英国各地。在中东，美国正加紧扩张中；在加拿大，美国已把它作为泛美同盟的第二十二国；在印度，特别关心尼泊尔小王国，并已承认其独立；在南太平洋，则要求澳国与纽西兰的岛屿作为基地。由帝国特惠制度而建立起来的英帝国的经济统一，正受着美国的总攻击。英国已决定最低限度必须增加出口百分之七十五，否则收支就不能平衡。但美国则坚持取消特惠制，至少亦应缩小其范围，因为战时大英帝国所属各国曾与美国扩大贸易，美国不但要保持这些市场，而且要更加努力的把英国挤出这些市场。此种情形，难怪英国报纸与议员高呼着保护有关英帝国生死存亡的特惠制度；英国进步民主人士，甚至某些保守党政治家也反对美英某些独占集团将英国交与美国资本去掌管的政策。
    【新华社陕北十三日电】莫斯科讯：真理报外交评论家维克托罗夫十日著文评论艾德礼六日在英国下院的声明称：艾德礼所引述的一堆数字证明了，一年前美予英之贷款，远没有使英国经济情势缓和下来，而是由于贷款条件的施行，结果是象一个圈套套在英国国民经济的颈上，而且越套越紧了。作者于分析美国贷款之种种苛刻条件后称：不难看出，美国债权人尽量使他的债务人在可能最大限度上依从他，尽量使贷款成为强大经济与政治压力的工具。作者继称：艾德礼想用美国已同意修改贷款条件这一远景来抚慰他的群众，可是这个远景是颇可怀疑的。马歇尔六日向记者称：对英贷款条件可能放宽，并可不经国会批准即付实行。但美财长斯奈德则紧接着即行否认马歇尔所谓可不经国会通过之说。美国报纸说：英国正精心地夸大其困难，以自美国获得新贷款，作为鲁尔谈判中让步的补偿。因此，美国对艾德礼讲演的第一个评论说明，艾德礼企图以其演讲软化铁石心肠的美国债权人，这并未成功，可是，英国政策的领导人所不企望的目的，即将英美“友谊”的反面却显露给世界舆论界了。
    【新华社陕北十三日电】据塔斯社十日电引证美报言论证实美国正狂妄地从政治与经济方面干预英国。纽约时报称：“英国至今一味强调着自己的孱弱和匮乏，从华盛顿去访问的人已数次明白地说，英国最好在急需品的生产够用后，再去实行工业国有化。”该报透露：“华盛顿官员利用英国的困难，以迫使英国政策更加向右转。”纽约先驱论坛报称：克来顿将和澳洲的复建部长德曼赴伦敦，与英商务大臣克利浦斯会谈美国“援英”的问题，而以英国完全取消帝国特惠权为条件。下午报以另一恣态写道：“英国经济困难大部是由于供养庞大军队造成的，工党政府虽以反帝国主义纲领而当选，但仍企图保有远非英国能力所及的帝国主义雄心。”暗示要英国把它“远非能力所及”的地位让给美国。
