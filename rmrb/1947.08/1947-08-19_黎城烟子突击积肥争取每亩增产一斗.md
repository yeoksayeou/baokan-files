　　Licheng Yanzi Launches Crash Program to Accumulate Manure and Strive for an Increase of One Dou Per Mu
　　[Report from our newspaper in Licheng] The masses in the Yanzi area of the First District, taking advantage of the widespread rainfall, are concentrating all their labor power to fully develop a production increase campaign. In addition to reclaiming wasteland for wheat planting, they have also put forward the idea of "people not failing the land, and the land not failing the people," breaking the habit of "hanging up the hoe after the Autumn Begins," and developing deep plowing and careful cultivation, improving technology, and more raking and hoeing, to increase grain production. All the village's more than 600 mu of grain land has been raked once. Including supplementary raking, it has been hoed a total of three times. 480 mu has been hoed three times. All 381 mu of corn have been hoed three times. All 190 mu of "Golden Queen" (corn variety) has been top-dressed and hoed once, striving for four hoeings. Cotton has completed five hoeings, adding one more hoeing. The whole village has 521 mu of main crop wheat land and 42 draft animals, all of which are involved in plowing the wheat land two or three times. In previous years, it was only plowed three times, but this year, with the continuous rain, fearing that water would run off, all the land will be plowed one more time (four times) to conserve water and loosen the soil. The plan is to apply at least 35 *dan* of fertilizer per mu of wheat land. The hero Wen Mixian promoted manure accumulation with the slogan "accumulating manure is like accumulating gold." His team exceeded the plan, reaching 45 *dan*, and bought 100 sheep together to graze on the land. To help military dependents and revolutionary martyrs complete their production increase plans, the three sheep groups in the village were organized to graze on their land first. The whole village has 521 mu of wheat land, and at 35 *dan* per mu, a total of 18,215 *dan* of fertilizer is needed. Including sheep manure, oil cake, stubble fertilizer, wheat bran compost, etc., a total of 24,233 *dan* of fertilizer has been accumulated, which allows for 46 *dan* of fertilizer per mu, exceeding the original plan by 11 *dan*. This ensures that production will definitely increase by one *dou* next year. According to the situation in each group, there are also plans to plant 150 mu of changed stubble wheat, planning to fumigate wasteland, compost, use artemisia fertilizer, and stove soil, pond soil, etc., also aiming to apply 35 *dan* of fertilizer per mu. The whole village has truly formed a "accumulating manure is like accumulating gold" movement. To ensure the completion of the production increase plan, a mutual inspection movement has been launched, and it is scheduled to convene cadres from seven key villages, heroes, and experienced old farmers in Yanzi (Northwest Key Village) on the 14th of this month to provide technical guidance on deep plowing and careful cultivation and to inspect the production increase, learn from experience, and promote the entire Northwest Key Area.
