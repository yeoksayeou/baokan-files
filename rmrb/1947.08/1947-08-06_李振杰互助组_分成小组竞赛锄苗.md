    Li Zhenjie Mutual Aid Group
    Divided into Small Groups for Weeding Competition
    [This newspaper reports] The Li Zhenjie mutual aid group in Xidaying, the second district of Gaoyi, is composed of seventeen liberated peasants. They realized that they suffered from carrying burdens, doing short-term jobs, and working in coal mines in the past. Now that they have been liberated, they must work hard. The whole group has fourteen full laborers, four half laborers, and six and a half livestock, and cultivates more than 320 mu of land. The consistent recording of work points and allocation of labor at equal value are all good. Now, in order to compete for seedling protection and weeding, they are divided into three groups, each electing a group leader. The crops of this group are growing well everywhere, and they work harder for the military families than for themselves. When other groups can't finish their work, this group often helps other groups. In order to save labor, everyone discusses at the market, and one or two people go to the market to buy and sell things. After the group was divided into three groups, they worked particularly hard. The first group led by Li Zhenjie, with six laborers, weeded 25 mu of land in one day, which attracted the attention of the whole village. Li Sandan said: "I have never worked so hard in my life. Now I don't feel tired when I work together." These six people also helped others harvest millet at noon, and harvested four mu of millet in a little over an hour. (Gaoyi Production News)
    [This newspaper reports] Comrade Ma Zhenlao, the town leader of Qicun Town in Pingxiang, in order to seize the time to carry out a blitz weeding campaign, first led the three cadres of the town government to organize a mutual aid weeding effort. In order to maintain the daily work of the whole town, they decided that generally one person would stay to work in the morning while three would go to the fields, and two would work in the morning and afternoon while two would go to the fields, working in this rotational manner. Sometimes when there was less work, they would all go to the fields together, and when there was more work, they would keep more people behind, flexibly determining this according to the work situation. In this way, the work not only did not suffer any loss, but also completed the weeding task. Now, the 35 mu of small seedlings have been weeded for the first time, and they have started weeding for the second time. They all said with great confidence: "We guarantee that mutual aid will not hinder work or delay family matters." (Pingxiang Victory News)
    [This newspaper reports from Taihang] Guo Zhian, manager of the No. 1 Gun Factory of the Fifth Military Subdistrict, and Yang Zhanggui, chairman of the trade union, in order to help the masses complete the weeding task ahead of schedule and avoid wasting seedlings, specially called on all employees of the factory on Saturday, July 19th, to help military families with weeding on Sunday on a voluntary basis. The workers were very enthusiastic and competed to go. That night, 50 people voluntarily signed up. The next morning, Manager Guo and Director Yang personally led the way, and soon there were more than 60 people, helping military families weed 17 and a half mu of land, and helping landlords weed five and a half mu of land, totaling 23 mu. All the people in the village jumped for joy. An old man of about sixty years old said: "Under the leadership of Chairman Mao, there is a real way. The army and the people are one family, and we are not afraid of any difficulties." (Suo Tongxing, Jianguo)
