The "Boiling in One Pot" Experience in Tangdong
Zhang Jie, Xianjin

(I)
When work was initiated in Tang (Yin) Dong, some puppet soldiers and even special agents infiltrated the farmers' association disguised as progressives. The masses used to call these people "the vegetables of the 'guang gui', the harm to the 'yan zi'" (the rich and powerful who are cunning are called 'guang gui', honest people are called 'yan zi'). Now they have become "triple insured" – they were puppet soldiers under the Japanese, the first insurance; they were in the Central Army under the Kuomintang, the second insurance; and they still want to thrive when the People's Liberation Army arrives, the third insurance. They "jumped around" in everything, and the honest peasants still couldn't rise up from under their feet. After discovering this problem, the class background, family origin, and six kinship relations (social connections) of members were investigated in the farmers' association to clarify the ranks. The movement was launched. The methods were:

1.  The leadership called on the farmers' association to ensure that genuine farmers were in charge so they could thoroughly turn themselves around and that puppet soldiers and other elements could not be in charge. At the same time, the farmers themselves discussed and examined the class background, family origin, and six kinship relations of each cadre and member. The farmers were extremely excited when they heard that they were going to take control of the leadership.

2.  After the investigation, the masses reviewed the reasons why they were puppet soldiers and whether they had done bad things. Those who were forced to participate and had not done anything bad were already absorbed into the farmers' association, but they could not be cadres or militiamen. Those with problems were expelled from the farmers' association and detained for struggle.

3.  After the review, red strips were hung on the doors of the homes of those in the farmer's association, and the farmers felt extremely honored; white strips were hung on the doors of the landlords; and gray strips were hung on the doors of those who had relations with and protected the landlords. The gray-striped families were called upon to break with the landlords and perform meritorious service to get red strips, which had a great effect. Dasing Village turned those who were found to be pre-farmers' association members, and the method for them was to perform meritorious service to transform and then re-enter the farmers' association. These people immediately launched a movement to perform meritorious service. Meng Zhaolai's wife was demoted to a probationary member of the farmers' association because she had not broken off relations with the landlord. He immediately said, "I will break off relations tonight." After he said that, he went to Li Yu Village and brought back the landlord Meng Zhaomin's wife, performed meritorious service, and got a red strip.

(II)

1.  In the four districts of Tangdong, a total of more than 2,000 landlord households were detained. The activists at the Wuling base did not even bother to eat after the meeting, and detained 215 households in one night (both men and women). After the landlords were detained, the masses reflected, "This time we can vent our anger and turn ourselves around!" Detaining all the landlords excited and encouraged the masses; it was a fierce head-on blow to the landlords; and it was a stabilization for the middle peasants (the middle peasants felt that those who should be struggled against had been detained, and those who should not be struggled against had not been detained). The method of detaining landlords was that in areas with a good work foundation, activists discussed the targets, clarified class divisions, and detained the landlords, and then held a farmers' meeting to discuss class divisions and approve the actions of the activists. If they detained the wrong person, the farmers' meeting would make the decision. Another method was used in areas with a poor work foundation: the leadership investigated and studied, detained the targets, and then held a farmers' meeting to expose the crimes of the landlords and discuss class divisions. Experience has proven that even in areas with no work, once the landlords were detained, a large number of activists emerged and became the locomotives of the movement, driving the movement forward.

2.  There were all kinds of struggle targets, and the peasants had all kinds of hatred. After detaining the landlords, they conducted great brewing and great collusion, and put forward the slogan "A thousand years of grievances are reported together." The farmers' association, women's association, and children's corps held separate meetings to express their grievances and compete to perform meritorious service. They called on the middle peasants and poor and hired peasants to struggle together and turn themselves around together. They called on puppet soldiers to perform meritorious service to turn themselves around and take off their hats. This naturally formed a competition between men and women to struggle and perform meritorious service. The slogans "Strive to be a model" and "Strive to perform more meritorious service for the people" quickly became a mass movement, and those who performed meritorious service were put on the red list, and their morale was even higher. This competition between people was expanded to streets and villages. Several villages brought their targets to one place to compete in expressing their grievances and struggling. More than 5,000 people participated in the first competition in Wuling, North Wuling, and Hucha villages, and 391 people performed meritorious service. The first street in Wuling won first place. The women of Wuling and North Wuling were praised by all the farmers. The Fifth District created the standard that those who did well in the struggle should be commended for meritorious service. The Seventh District created red strips for the civil and military champions. Those who were good at expressing grievances and reasoning were immediately given red strips for "civil champions"; those who broke with the landlords and struggled fiercely were given red strips for "military champions," and the morale of the masses was even higher. This competition affected the entire Tangdong area, and the movement was rapidly promoted and improved.

(III)

After the objects were detained by the peasants themselves and after class delineation, the peasants' awareness was raised. All the struggle objects were handed over to the peasants and handled freely by the peasants. Full power was granted to the peasants, and whoever had grievances against that landlord would pull him out to struggle. There were several to twenty or thirty struggle scenes at one struggle meeting, with men struggling after women, and this scene pulling the struggle to that scene. "Boil the big pot and boil the small pot, boil one pot and boil it again," boiling in this way in turn, boiling to the fullest, until it is completely rotten. The Fifth District created the method of struggling against landlords through public trial, organizing a people's court (setting up a platform and writing "People's Court" in large letters), and writing the list of landlords, their evil deeds, and the nicknames given to them by the masses on large pieces of paper; on the list of landlords who escaped in fear of punishment, the slogan "People run away but crimes cannot escape" was written in large characters. As soon as the masses entered the venue, they were greatly encouraged, felt that the struggle was reasonable and legal, and were confident and strong, which was a great suppression for the landlords. The struggle meeting was completely a trial of the landlords by the masses, and the methods of reasoning, fighting, and law were brought into play. The farmers themselves completely reasoned and determined the crimes in the struggle, and the district cadres everywhere supported and presided over the meeting and praised the victory. Wherever there was victory, the comrades quickly spread the good news orally, and the masses' momentum was even greater.

However, it is easy to form a gust of wind in the booming struggle. Therefore, ideological mobilization was especially emphasized from the beginning of the movement. There are two methods: First, from the beginning of the detention of the landlords to the final handling, we thoroughly clarified class divisions, expressed grievances, and analyzed the crimes of the landlords. Understand the reasons why landlords become rich and peasants become poor, and enlighten the peasants' class consciousness. The second is to open training courses, where typical grievances are expressed and centrally exposed. The Eighth District created a method of looking back at the old society. The peasants turned over the rules and regulations of the old society and looked at them again and again. As a result, they were all for the landlords' benefit, and they suddenly realized. The reason why the Tangdong "boiling in one pot" movement was able to gradually improve was that it promoted the experience of action education and educating action.

(IV)

Propaganda and mobilization work is one of the characteristics of the Tangdong movement. Appropriately and timely put forward slogans, and during the great sensation, put forward: "Boil in one pot, sweep away, overthrow the landlords, and live a good life." The peasants were afraid of doing something wrong and violating the policy. We put forward "The poor are the policy, whatever you do to the landlords is right." The peasants wanted to know what the life would be like after turning over, and we put forward: "With a house and land, put it outside the door of the big cart, feed the mules and horses at the trough, put a table and cabinet in the house, and the wife and children will not suffer!" The landlords pretended to be poor and confused the masses, and we put forward: "Do not believe the landlords' fake crying poverty, resolutely struggle without mercy!" Timely mobilization slogans played a great role in solving the peasants' ideological problems and pointing out the direction of the struggle. The second is the songs "The Poor are Difficult" and "Great Turnaround," which made some of the masses sing to the point of weeping.

(V)

In the large-scale "boiling in one pot" movement, women fought against landlords, detained cases, expressed grievances, reasoned, engaged in internal affairs, etc., no less than men. In the first movement in Wuling, more than 60 men performed meritorious service, and more than 50 women performed meritorious service and were put on the red list. Generally, at the struggle meeting, men pulled away male targets, and women pulled away female targets, removing the phenomenon that women were supporting roles in the past struggle, who could only express grievances but could not handle them. Women's wisdom was highly developed, and their enthusiasm was unprecedentedly high. In addition, after investigating class and family relations, poor women became cadres. Good women became cadres, and the rest of the women participated in the women's association without any scruples. Under the slogan of "The whole family joins the farmers' association, the whole family is glorious," the family did not prevent them, but mobilized them to join the association.

　　汤东一锅煮经验
    张捷　先进
    　　　　（一）
    汤（阴）东工作开辟时，有些伪军甚至特务分子，以假进步面貌钻进农会。这些人群众以前叫做“光鬼的菜，眼子的害”（有钱有势狡猾为光鬼，老实人为眼子），现在成了三保险——日本人在当伪军为一保险，中央军在当中央军为二保险，解放军来了还想吃得开为三保险；一切事情由他们“蹦跳”，老实农民还是在脚底下起不来。发现此问题后，在农会中查阶级、查出身、查六亲（社会关系）关系，澄清阵营。运动开展了。其做法：
    一、领导上在农会上号召，必须有真正农民当家，才能翻透身，伪军等分子不能当家；一面由农民自己讨论审查每个干部会员的成份出身六亲关系。农民一听说自己要掌握领导兴奋异常。
    二、经查出之后，再经群众审查当伪军的原因及是否做过坏事，被迫参加而且没做过什么坏事的，群众已吸收入农会，但不能当干部和民兵。有问题的开除农会扣起来斗争。
    三、审查之后，在农会的挂上红条，农民感觉无尚光荣；地主挂上白条；和地主有关系包庇户挂上灰条；并号召挂上灰条的与地主撕破脸，立功挂红条，作用很大。大性村把审查出来的成为预备农会会员，对他们办法是立功转变再入农会，这些人马上掀起立功运动。孟昭来的老婆因没有和地主打断关系，被农会降为预备农会员，他马上说：“今天黑夜就要打断”，说罢到李于村把地主孟昭民的老婆弄回来，立了功，挂上了红条。
    　　　　（二）
    一、汤东四个区，共扣地主二千余户。五陵基点积极分子，会后连饭不顾得吃，一晚上扣了二百一十五户（男女均扣）扣起地主之后，群众反映：“这一下可能出好气，翻透身了！”把地主全部扣押，兴奋与鼓舞了群众；对地主则是猛烈的迎头痛；对中农是一个稳定（中农觉得该斗的已扣起，中农不该斗没有扣），扣押地主的办法，一种是工作基础好的地区，由积极分子讨论对象，划清阶级，扣住地主，再开农民大会讨论划阶级，批准积极分子的行动；如扣错了，以农民大会为决定意见。另一种是工作基础较差的地区，由领导上调查研究，扣住对象，再开农民大会，集中揭露地主罪恶讨论划阶级。经验证明：虽无工作地区，但一经扣押地主，即涌现出来大批积极分子，成为运动火车头，推动运动前进。
    二、斗争对象有各种各样，农民们有各种各样仇恨，扣起后，进行大酝酿大串通，提出“千年冤仇一齐报”的口号，农会、妇女会、儿童团分别开会诉苦，立功比赛；号召中农与贫雇农共同斗争，共同翻身。号召伪军分子立功翻身脱帽子。这么很自然的形成男女比赛斗争，比赛立功。“争取当模范”“争取多为人民立功劳”的口号，迅速变为群众的运动了，立下功的上了红榜，情绪更为高涨。这种人与人的比赛扩大为街与街村与村，好几个村子带上对象到一个地点，比赛诉苦斗争。五陵、北五陵、互查等村第一次比赛斗争五千余人，三百九十一人立了功，五陵第一街荣获第一。五陵与北五陵妇女荣获全体农民之赞扬。五区创造斗争中好的当立功。七区创造文武状元挂红条。诉苦讲理好的马上挂上“文状元”的红条；与地主撕破脸斗得狠的挂上“武状元”红条，群众情绪更高。此次比赛斗争，影响全汤东，运动迅速推进与提高。
    　　　　（三）
    对象由农民自己扣起，经过划阶级之后，农民觉悟提高，全部斗争对象交给农民，由农民自由处理。全权授与农民，谁对那个地主有冤仇，就拉出来斗争那个。一个斗争会有几个至二三十个斗争场面，男人斗罢女人斗，这场斗罢那场拉去斗。“大锅煮了小锅煮，一锅煮了回锅煮”，这样轮番的煮，尽情的煮，一直煮个稀巴烂。五区更创造用人民公审的方式斗争地主，组织人民法庭（搭起台子大书“人民法庭”），把地主名单及其恶迹和群众给他的绰号写在大纸上；畏罪脱逃地主名单上写“人跑了罪跑不了”大字标语。群众一进会场，即得到很大鼓励，觉得斗争合理合法，腰粗气壮，对地主则是很大镇压。斗争会完全是群众对地主的审判，发挥斗理斗力斗法的办法。斗争中完全由农民自己说理定罪，区干部则是到处撑腰作主，歌颂胜利；那里胜利了，工作同志便迅速口头传送捷报，群众行动劲头更大起来。
    但轰轰烈烈斗争中很容易形成一阵风。因此运动开始即特别强调思想发动。其作法有二：一是扣押地主之始至最后处理，贯彻划清阶级、诉苦、分析地主罪恶。认识地主之所以致富、农民之所以致穷原因，启发农民阶级自觉。二是开训练班，典型诉苦集中揭露。八区创造翻看旧社会的办法，农民把旧社会的规矩制度翻开看了又看，结果都是为地主打算，恍然大悟。汤东一锅煮运所以能逐渐提高，是发扬了行动教育，教育行动的经验。
    　　　　（四）
    宣传鼓动工作是汤东运动特点之一，适当的及时的提出口号，在大轰动的时候提出：“一锅煮一扫光斗倒地主过时光。”农民怕干错了违反政策，我们提出“穷人就是政策，对地主怎干怎对。”农民想知道翻身后的时光如何，我们提出：“有了房有了地，大车门外放，骡马槽头喂，家里摆上桌和柜，老婆孩子不受罪！”地主装穷迷糊群众，我们提出：“不信地主假哭穷，坚决斗争不留情！”及时的鼓动口号，对农民思想问题的解决指出斗争方向起的作用很大。其次是“穷人难”“大翻身”歌曲，有些地方群众唱的泣不成声。
    　　　　（五）
    大规模一锅煮运动中，妇女斗争地主扣案子诉苦说理搞内货等等都不下男人。五陵第一次运动中，男人六十多个立了功，妇女五十多个立了功上了红榜。一般在斗争会上，男人拉走男对象，妇女拉走女对象，去掉过去斗争妇女是配角，只能诉苦不能处理的现象，妇女智慧高度发挥，积极性空前提高。此外经过查阶级查家庭关系，贫妇女当了干部。好妇女当了干部，其余妇女参加妇即无戒心。在“全家入农会，全家光荣”的口号下，家庭不是阻止她们，而是动员她们入会了。
