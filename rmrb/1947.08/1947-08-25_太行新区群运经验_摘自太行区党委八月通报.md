Taihang New District Mass Movement Experience
--Excerpt from the August Circular of the Taihang District Party Committee

　　In the past month, most areas of Jingxing, Yuanshi, Huolu, Wenxian, Xiuwu, Ye County, Anyang, Tangyin, and other counties in the Taihang area have vigorously and rapidly launched a peasant emancipation movement to pour out grievances, seek revenge, and carry out anti-traitor liquidation and land reform, achieving great results. This historic feat of peasant transformation has created the following experiences:

　　1. Take practical actions to expose all enemy deceptions, boldly support the masses, and ignite the flames of mass emancipation quickly and vigorously.

　　The peasants in the new districts, who have suffered from long-term plunder by the enemy and puppets and the exploitation and extortion of usurious landlords and local bullies, have been devastated and face severe famine. Therefore, the peasants' demand for emancipation is universal and urgent. However, on the other hand, the masses do not yet fully understand certain aspects of our work, and the continuous rumors and sabotage by enemy puppets, landlords, and special agents have made the masses worried and initially afraid to approach us, increasing the difficulty of our work. To overcome these difficulties, vigorously carrying out a propaganda offensive is not enough to completely dispel the masses' doubts. We must also break the masses' doubts through practical policy actions and induce mass struggle. For example, after the establishment of Ye County on May 3rd, it immediately destroyed 42 puppet Bao-Gong offices, confiscated all the properties of 134 major traitors, and distributed them to the masses, which played a decisive role in supporting the peasants. All enemy rumors were immediately exposed by the facts. Therefore, the flames of struggle in the county spread rapidly within just ten days. Among them, the Fifth District, in the struggle to divide land and wheat, quickly established 89 village democratic regimes. A large number of activists emerged in each village, and the movement developed unprecedentedly rapidly and enthusiastically.

　　2. Train a large number of activists, overcome ideological concerns such as fear of change by promoting positive ideological factors, raise awareness through pouring out grievances, and inspire the fighting spirit to take action.

　　Training a large number of activists is the key to launching the mass emancipation movement in the new districts. The eight counties in Taihang have trained a total of more than 18,000 activists, which played a significant organizational role in the movement in the new districts.

　　To train activists and resolve the masses' confused thinking, we must start by focusing on the positive ideological factors of the masses (i.e., the masses' desire to be emancipated and to have land) and encouraging their fighting spirit (i.e., the masses' desire to redress grievances, seek revenge, and struggle for emancipation) to overcome ideological concerns, rather than passively resolving ideological concerns first. For example, in the training of activists in Haojiaao Village, Tangyin, Tang Jishan and others recounted more than 100 facts of the persecution and rule of the villagers by the Wang Zhangwu brothers, local tyrants and bullies, which aroused the anger and indignation of more than 500 activists present. When it was recounted that Wang Zhangwu had forced 19 poor people to death, the spirit of "revenge and pay for life" rose in the entire field, and the fear of change and moral considerations were swept away. They all resolutely and unanimously demanded: "Return our land, return our grain, return the lives of the poor!" Jingxing, Xiuwu, and other counties also achieved the greatest and fastest results by starting with inspiring positive factors.

　　Experience has proven that we must recognize that the masses' desire to be emancipated and to have land is a basic requirement. Therefore, in pouring out grievances, we must firmly grasp and inspire this kind of class consciousness among the masses, explain that the peasant emancipation struggle is just and legitimate, that the Communist Party firmly advocates the emancipation of the poor, and that the democratic government will definitely support the emancipated masses. This will further mobilize the enthusiasm of the masses to be emancipated and to have land. After being trained in this way and called upon with such resounding slogans, a large number of activists returned to their villages and used their own suffering to draw out the suffering of others, and used their own awareness to enlighten the awareness of others. They connected piece by piece and layer by layer, starting fires everywhere, and smoke rose from every village. Therefore, the ranks of the emancipated masses were powerful and magnificent. In particular, some activists in Jingxing combined with the villages in the process of training and raising awareness, first detaining the local tyrants and bullies, and then immediately taking action after returning to their villages, making the movement even stronger.

　　3. Break the stage-based guiding ideology of anti-traitor liquidation followed by land reform, and approve a package of issues based on the demands and opinions of 90% of the masses, and launch the movement boldly through one-pot struggle.

　　The ability of the mass movement in the new districts to develop universally and rapidly in most areas in the past month is due to breaking the stage-based guiding ideology. This is because the leadership acted according to the opinions and wishes of the masses. The masses urgently demanded land and demanded to solve the problem of hunger. Therefore, they did not like to divide stages in the struggle. They demanded one-pot cooking, asking the landlords to spit out everything, including land, houses, livestock, grain, clothes, and all furniture. Under this guiding principle, most villages in Ye County took action in ten days. In the Second District of Wenxian County, 50 of the 57 natural villages launched counter-settlement and land reform movements in ten days. In Tangyin, in one month, peasants in five districts recovered 26,150 mu of land, 274 head of livestock, 2,627 shi of grain, and 32,139 pieces of clothing. 36,950 peasants in 75 administrative villages participated in the earth-shattering emancipation movement. The leadership in Jingxing originally decided to carry out liquidation first and then land reform, but in fact, the masses in most villages carried out one-pot struggle. The leadership's stage-based approach was not approved by 90% of the masses. Later, the leadership timely modified its own approach according to the opinions of the masses, and within 20 days, 50 of the 62 villages in the new district took action and pushed the movement to a deeper climax.

　　4. Distribute fairly and reasonably at any time with any struggle, and educate the masses and raise their awareness in the distribution of fruits.

　　The fruits of the struggle of the masses in Tangyin, Pingding, and other counties are distributed at any time with any struggle, which greatly encourages the masses' enthusiasm to continue to pursue the landlords. In the distribution of fruits, the principle of fair and reasonable filling and supplementing is adopted. The peasants in the whole village are divided into four levels according to their class status and poverty level. The fruits are uniformly converted into grain or money, and then distributed according to the needs of the level and population, striving to fill and supplement. In the distribution, the mass line of repeated discussions by the masses is adopted, so that the poor and middle peasants, men, women, old and young, can all have a share, uniting the broad masses. For rascals and bad elements, they should be dealt with separately according to the specific object. If they are rascals and bad elements of poor origin in history, they are generally formed due to the exploitation and oppression of the old society that made it impossible for them to live. Therefore, they should be allocated fruits to raise their class awareness. For the puppet personnel who worked for the enemy, such as poor peasants who were forced to work or were of a supporting nature due to livelihood at that time, they should also be given fruits to wash their faces and wipe out their crimes, raise their class awareness, and be held responsible for making meritorious deeds to atone for their sins and fight together with the peasants.

　　In the distribution of fruits, Tangyin and Pingding not only paid attention to the principle of fairness and reasonableness, but also regarded the distribution of fruits as a mobilization stage. The distribution of fruits is regarded as a summary of the struggle and as a way to mobilize the next struggle to raise the awareness of the masses. In the distribution of fruits, they led the masses to discuss three contents: 1. Whose fruits are these? Through discussion, the peasants realize that the fruits are their own sweat and blood, overcome the confused thinking of "this is the landlord's thing," and make the peasants justly and forcefully share the glorious fruits of the struggle. 2. Produce well after the distribution of fruits. Struggle for emancipation, in order to live a good life, and production for permanent not hungry, live a good time. Through these education, to overcome the waste of a few people after the distribution of fruits. 3. How did the fruits come about? Make the masses realize that it is the leadership of the Communist Party, the lead of cadres and activists, so that they support her and love them, and everyone can unite more to completely eliminate feudalism. At the same time, it is necessary to use the honor of making contributions and not being selfish for everyone's emancipation to overcome the thinking of some people who take credit for themselves and get more fruits of struggle, especially to launch mass-based comparison of merits, so that everyone can act more actively in the next movement.

　　5. Mobilize and arm at any time, strengthen ourselves and eliminate the enemy.

　　Although the movement in the new districts has developed rapidly and achieved results, the ruling class has not been completely defeated, especially in some villages where the struggle has not yet taken place. Landlords, special agents, and traitors are trying everything possible to counterattack the peasants, attempting to implement a restoration. Therefore, the emancipated peasants urgently demand to be armed in time to protect their vested interests. When the peasants in Wangjia Village, Jingxing, took action, they armed themselves with the more than 20 broadswords they had fought for in the past. The emancipated peasants in Changshengkou used the seven rifles they had fought for to suppress the local tyrants and landlords and monitor the targets of special agent struggle. In Tangyin, after taking action, 75 villages established 468 militia armed forces, disarming 746 long and short guns from the landlords to arm themselves. Once the masses are armed, they are full of heroism and say: "With our own people carrying guns, we are not afraid of failing to defeat the landlord dogs!" This is the manifestation of the emancipated masses' urgent demand to be armed. In the process of arming the masses, it should be combined with mass-based review, so as to prevent special agents from sneaking in to sabotage. At the same time, only by placing the armed forces on the basic masses who have been emancipated can we protect the vested interests of the emancipated masses and support the struggle of the masses to be completely emancipated.

　　太行新区群运经验
    ——摘自太行区党委八月通报
    一月来太行井陉、元氏、获鹿、温县、修武、邺县、安阳、汤阴等县的大部地区，已猛烈迅速的开展了农民大翻身的诉苦复仇反奸清算土地改革运动，并取得很大成绩。农民变革历史的这一壮举，已创造出如下几点经验：
　　一、以实际行动，揭破敌人一切欺骗，大胆撑腰，猛烈迅速把群众翻身烈火点燃起来。
    新区农民，在敌伪长期掠夺及地主恶霸的高利盘剥讹榨统治下，备受摧残，面临着严重的饥荒；因此农民翻身的要求是普遍而迫切的。但另一方面，群众对我们某些方面还不大了解，加之敌伪地主特务的不断造谣破坏，又使群众产生了顾虑，开始不敢接近我们，增加了我们的工作困难。要打破这些困难，大力开展宣传攻势还不能完全解除群众的怀疑，还必须从实际政策的行动，去打破群众的疑虑，诱导群众斗争。如邺县在五月三号成立后，立即摧毁敌伪四十二个保公所，没收一百三十四个大汉奸全部财产分给群众，给农民起了坚决撑腰的作用，敌人一切谣言马上为事实所揭破了。因此该县仅在十天内，斗争火焰便普遍燃烧起来，其中五区在分田分麦斗争中，便迅速建立起八十九个村民主政权，每村都涌现出大批积极分子，运动发展得空前迅速和热烈。
　　二、大量训练积极分子，从发扬思想积极因素中，去克服怕变天等思想顾虑，在诉苦中提高觉悟，激发斗志干起来。
    大批训练积极分子，是掀开新区群众翻身运动的关键，太行八个县先后共训练积极分子一万八千人之多，对新区运动起了极大的组织作用。
    训练积极分子，解决群众糊涂思想，必须从集中群众思想积极因素（即群众想翻身要土地思想）与鼓舞其斗志（即是群众伸冤报仇斗争翻身的思想）入手，去克服思想顾虑，不是消极的去先解决思想顾虑。如汤阴郝家凹村积极分子在训练中，以唐吉善为首的把村中奸霸王璋五弟兄在村迫害统治群众的一百多件事实诉出后，激起了全场五百多积极分子的怒愤。当诉到王璋五前后逼死穷人十九条人命时，全场“要报仇要偿命”的劲头都起来了，怕变天与良心思想遂一扫而光，都坚决一致要求：“还我们土地，还我们粮食，还穷人的命！”井陉、修武等县，从启发积极因素入手，收效亦最大而快。
    经验证明：我们必须认识群众想翻身要土地是基本要求。因此在诉苦中我们又必须抓紧启发群众此种阶级自觉，说明农民翻身斗争是正义合法的，共产党是坚决主张穷人翻身的，民主政府是一定要给翻身群众作主的，这就把群众要翻身要土地的热劲更加发动起来了。经过这样训练的，以这样响亮的口号作号召，大批积极分子回村后，便以自己的苦引旁人的苦，以自己的觉悟，启发旁人的觉悟，一片一片的串通，一层一层的串通，到处点火，村村冒烟。因此翻身群众的阵容声势雄壮。特别是井陉有些村积极分子，在训练提高觉悟过程中，就和村里结合起来，先把恶霸扣起，等到自己回村后便立即干起来，使运动格外劲上加劲。
　　三、打破反奸清算而后土地改革的阶段论指导思想，要批准以百分之九十群众要求和意见的一揽子题目，一锅煮斗争去放手发动。
    一月来，新区群运能在大部地区普遍迅速的开展，就是打破了阶段论的指导思想。这就是领导上依照了群众的意见与自愿去行动。群众迫切要求土地，要求解决饿肚问题；因此在斗争中他们不喜欢分阶段，他们要求一锅煮，把土地房屋牲口粮食衣服一切家具等叫地主一口吐出来。在这样指导方针下，邺县在十天中，全县大部村庄都行动起来。温县二区五十七个自然村中，十天即有五十个村开展了反倒算与土改运动。汤阴五个区在一个月中农民即收回土地二六一五○亩，牲口二百七十四头，粮食二六二七石，衣服三二一三九件，七十五个行政村三六九五○个农民参加了翻天覆地的大翻身运动。井陉领导上原决定先清算而后土地改革，可是实际上多数村群众都进行了一锅煮斗争；领导上分阶段的方针，百分之九十的群众没有批准，以后领导上及时根据群众意见修改了自己方针后，即在二十天内，新区六十二个村，就有五十个村行动起来，并把运动推向深入的高潮。
　　四、随斗随分公平合理，在分果实中教育群众提高觉悟。
    汤阴、平定等县的群众斗争果实，是采取随斗随分办法，这对群众继续追击地主的情绪鼓励很大。在分果实时，是采取公平合理的填平补齐原则，以成份和贫苦程度将全村农民分为四级，果实统一折成粮食或钱，然后再按等级需要人口分配，务求其到填平补齐。在分配中，又采取了群众三番五次讨论的群众路线，因此使贫雇中农男女老少都能有份，团结了广大的群众。对于流氓坏蛋，应分别具体对象处理，如果历史上是贫苦成份的流氓坏蛋，一般均因旧社会对他的统治剥削无法过活而流浪养成的，因此应分配果实，提高其阶级觉悟。对于敌人干事的伪人员，如因当时为生活所迫或支差性质的贫苦农民，也应分果实，洗脸擦黑，提高其阶级觉悟，责其立功赎罪和农民一起进行斗争。
    汤阴、平定分配果实中，不但注重了公平合理的原则，同时还把分配果实当成一个发动阶段来作。把分果实当成一次斗争总结，当成发动下次斗争提高群众觉悟的方式。他们在分果实中，领导群众讨论了三个内容：一、果实是谁的？从讨论中使农民认识果实是自己的血汗，克服“这是地主东西”的糊涂思想，使农民理直气壮的去分光荣的斗争果实。二、分果实后要好好生产。斗争为了翻身，为了能过好活，生产为永久不挨饿，过好时光，通过这些教育，来克服少数人分果实后的浪费现象。三、果实怎样得的？使群众觉悟到是共产党的领导，干部积极分子的带头，从而拥护她，爱护他们，大家更加团结起来，才能彻底消灭封建。同时要用为大家翻身立功不自私的荣誉来克服某些人以功自居多得斗争果实的思想，特别是展开群众性的比功运动，使大家在下一次运动行动得更加积极。
　　五、随时发动随时武装，壮大自己消灭敌人。
    虽然新区运动开展得迅速有成绩，但统治阶级远没有彻底斗垮，特别是部分村还未斗争，地主特务汉奸还想尽一切办法反攻农民，企图实行复辟；因此翻身农民为保护既得利益，就迫切要求及时武装起来。井陉王家村农民行动起来时，就把过去会斗二十多把大刀武装了自己。长生口翻身农民将斗争出来的七支大枪用来镇恶霸地主，监视特务斗争对象。汤阴在行动起来后，七十五个村即建立起四六八个民兵武装，从地主手里解除七四六支长短枪来武装自己。群众一经武装起来，即英雄十足的说：“有咱们自己人抗起枪来，还怕地主狗的干不倒！”这就是翻身群众迫切要求武装的表现。在武装群众过程中，应与群众性的审查相结合，这样才能防止特务钻进来破坏；同时也只把武装放在翻身的基本群众身上，才能保卫翻身群众既得的利益，支援群众彻底翻身的斗争。（本报资料室）
