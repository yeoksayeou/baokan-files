Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 1st. American imperialism has once again decided to equip and train twenty more divisions for Chiang Kai-shek, further slaughtering the Chinese people through the hands of the traitor Chiang Kai-shek, attempting to salvage its running dog Chiang Kai-shek's military crisis. According to Agence France-Presse, Nanjing, 30th: Well-informed sources report: According to a plan approved before Wedemeyer's arrival in China, twenty Kuomintang divisions will be trained and equipped by the United States. It is said that the training camp will be established in Taiwan, and the training will be the responsibility of Sun Liren. It is generally believed that the United States' choice of Taiwan as the training camp site has further exposed the U.S. imperialist ambition to invade Taiwan. It is also learned that Wedemeyer met with Wei Daoming, chairman of the Chiang-appointed Taiwan Province, on July 31, which is related to this "training" plan and invasion plan. Observers here point out: Blood debts will be repaid in blood. Any murderers, whether domestic or foreign, must eventually pay their price. U.S. imperialism's dream of saving Chiang Kai-shek's life is just that—a dream. They previously failed to avert Chiang Kai-shek's military crisis by equipping and training forty-five divisions of Kuomintang troops, and today they will certainly not be able to save Chiang Kai-shek from his final defeat with twenty divisions.

    妄想救走狗的命
    美再给蒋装训廿个师
    【新华社陕北一日电】美国帝国主义顷又决定再为蒋介石装训二十个师，借经卖国贼蒋介石的手进一步屠杀中国人民，妄图挽救其走狗蒋介石的军事危机。据法国新闻社南京三十日电称：消息灵通人士讯：遵照魏德迈抵华前批准的一个计划，二十个国民党师将由美国加以训练和装备。据传，训练营地将在台湾建立，训练由孙立人负责。一般相信：美国选择台湾训练营地，又暴露了美帝国主义侵略台湾之野心。另据悉：七月三十一日魏德迈曾接见蒋记台湾省主席魏道明，即与此项“训练”计划及侵略计划有关。此间观察家指出：血债将由血来还，任何中外杀人犯，最后必须付出他们的代价。美帝国主义妄想给蒋介石救命是在做梦，他们从前没有能够以装训四十五个师的国民党军队避免蒋介石军事危机的到来，今天同样亦决不能以二十个师，挽救蒋介石最后失败的命运。
