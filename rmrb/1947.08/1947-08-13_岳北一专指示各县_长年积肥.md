　　Yuebei First Administrative Region Directs All Counties
  　Accumulate Fertilizer Year-Round
    [This newspaper's Taiyue dispatch of the 11th] The First Administrative Office of Yuebei has issued instructions to all counties, calling for the launch of a year-round fertilizer accumulation campaign. The letter stated: Because farmers in our region have not paid attention to year-round fertilizer accumulation, when fertilizer is needed, it is always too late to be effective. Therefore, it calls on all counties to: (1) Launch a year-round fertilizer accumulation campaign. Use examples of good and bad harvests due to more or less fertilizer application to organize the masses to discuss and compare, and commend models of long-term fertilizer accumulation to promote this work. (2) Utilize certain seasons to organize fertilizer accumulation. For example, currently, we should seize the autumn season to cut artemisia and press green manure, fumigate manure in the spring, and compost various straw fertilizers in the winter. In addition, regularly lead the work of paving livestock pens, building manure pools, digging roadside pits, sweeping roadside fertilizer, and filling thatch pits. In mountain villages like Anze County, we should focus on pressing green manure, while in the Baijin plains, we should focus on composting straw after autumn. (3) Organize women, children, and other semi-laborers to accumulate fertilizer. The instruction letter concluded: This work must be implemented immediately in order to lay the foundation for year-round fertilizer accumulation on the basis of large-scale fertilizer accumulation in the autumn.

　　岳北一专指示各县
  　长年积肥
    【本报太岳十一日电】岳北一专署顷特向各县发出指示信，号召开展长年积肥运动。该信略称：由于本区农民没有注意长年积肥，致每到用粪的时候，缓不济急。因此号召各县：（一）开展长年积肥运动，用多上粪和少上粪的现实例子组织群众算帐对比讨论，表扬长期积肥的模范，以推动这一工作开展。（二）利用一定的季节，组织积肥。如目前应抓紧秋季割蒿压绿肥，春季薰粪，冬季沤各种秸杆肥。另外，要经常领导垫圈、垫粪池、挖路坑、扫路肥、灌茅坑等。在安泽等县靠山村庄，应抓紧压绿肥，白晋平原地带抓紧秋后沤秸杆。（三）组织妇女儿童等半劳力积肥。该指示信最后指出：要把这一工作马上执行起来，以便在秋季大积肥的基础上，打下长年积肥的基础。
