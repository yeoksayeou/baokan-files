Learning from Liu Cuimiao
Military Dependents in the Sixth District of Ji County
Request to Farm Land Themselves

[Report from our Jinnan Office on the 4th] The model military dependent Liu Cuimiao has become a shining banner for military dependents in Ji County. At a meeting of military dependents in the Sixth District, over two hundred military households requested to farm the land themselves, emulating Liu Cuimiao. Wang Hengfeng and Xu Mingsan of Wang Haizhuang said, "I used to farm myself, and I contributed to the people. Today, I want to add to my contributions. I am determined to learn from Liu Cuimiao and not rely on the village for farm work or housework, saving labor for more production." Zhang Sanhui, who is sixty years old, received seven mu of land and a residence after liberation. When he sent his son to join the army, he repeatedly told him, "Don't worry about the family; I have enough to eat and wear. Listen to the command in the army, and come to see your father after defeating Old Chiang." When the village cadres saw that he was old, they assigned someone to do his work, but he firmly refused, saying, "I have suffered since I was a child and have farmed all my life. I am not convinced that I can't do this little bit of work." Guo Yubao and more than forty other military dependents' wives in Hanzhuang requested to do their own farm work and housework. Under the influence of these model people, in various villages, some military dependents have shifted from full-scale substitute farming to full-scale self-farming. The vast majority of military dependents are determined to "do whatever they can themselves," and only resort to substitute farming when there is no other way. Currently, there is not a single household in the entire district that relies entirely on substitute farming. Li Jin, a woman from Xizhuang, connected three military dependents' households and led six women in a mutual aid group to weed the fields. Since the launch of the Liu Cuimiao self-farming movement among military dependents in this district, according to the calculations of fifteen military dependents' households, only over 190 mu of land needs to be farmed by substitutes, with each mu requiring 22 workdays. Adding housework, a total of 24 workdays are needed, saving 2,430 workdays compared to the original.

[Another item] Guo Jiuchang of Zhang Shijun Village in Wuyi County has been substitute farming three and a half mu of land for military dependents. He cares for it more than his own. In the spring, the land was full of green thorny vegetables, so he plowed it once. After the spring rain, he planted millet, but the seedlings didn't come out, and the green thorny vegetables grew taller. He and his two sons hoed it once. After a thorough rain, he planted corn. From planting to the emergence of the corn, he hoed it again, first for the military dependents. Now the corn is growing very well, and there are no weeds in the field. The masses have selected him as a model of supporting the army.

    学习刘翠苗
    冀县六区军属
    纷纷要求自耕
    【本报冀南四日电】模范军属刘翠苗，已成为冀县军属的一面光辉的旗帜。六区全区军属会上，二百余户军属纷纷要求自耕，向刘翠苗看齐。王海庄军属王恒丰、蒋庄徐明三说：“我过去就是自耕，总算给人民立了点功，今天要功上加功，坚决跟刘翠苗学，地里活家里活不依靠村里，省下劳力多生产。”张三会六十岁，翻身分了七亩地，又分了一处宅，这次送儿去参军，再三叮嘱他儿子说：“你别挂家，我不缺吃穿。到队上要听指挥，打完老蒋再来看你爹。”村干部看他上了年纪，把他的活固定专人做，他坚决拒绝说：“我从小就受苦，种地一辈子，做这点活我还不服气呢。”韩庄郭玉宝等四十多户军属妇女，地里、家里活都要求自己劳动。在这些模范人影响下，各村军属有从全数代耕转为全部自耕的，绝大部分军属都抱着“自己能做啥就做啥”的决心，实无办法才让代耕。现全区已经没有一户完全依靠代耕的了。西庄妇女李禁并串连三户军属带起六个妇女互助锄地。该区自军属中开展刘翠苗自耕运动以来，据十五户军属的计算，仅须代种土地一百九十余亩，每亩折二十二个工，加上家里活共计二十四个工。较原来节省劳力二千四百三十个工。
    【又息】武邑张士军村郭久长，给军属代耕了三亩半地。比自己的还关心。春天该地满地青棘菜，他就用犁耕了一次；春雨后耩上谷子，苗没出，青棘菜长高了，他和两个儿子用锄刨了一遍。落透雨又耩上棒子，从耩到棒子出来，又先给军属再锄一遍，现在棒子长的很好，地里也没有草。群众选他为优军模范。
