[This article was] transmitted by Taiyue [Military Region] on the 12th. In Changzi County, due to the full mobilization of cadres, all wheat fields in the county have been plowed once as of now. In addition, more than 2,900 mu of last year's fallow land were replanted with late autumn crops and autumn vegetables. Furthermore, 600 mu of new wasteland were opened up and replanted with black beans, buckwheat, soft millet, mustard greens, etc. Including the wheat fields from the previous harvest, there are a total of 36,400 mu. The late autumn vegetables are now growing very lushly and weeding has begun. The common people are all beaming with joy. An old man from Yang Village in the First District said: "The Communist Party's leadership is good. If it were the government of the past, who would care about these things!" The reason for achieving such results is mainly that cadres throughout the county have deeply publicized the experience of the 1943 famine. A village cadre from Liushu in the Sixth District said: "In 1943, we suffered from a natural disaster, and there was nothing to eat in the village, which was really hard to bear. We can't be careless this year. Planting more vegetables is better than having nothing to eat."

　　长子干部深入动员
  　全县麦地普犁一遍
    【本报太岳十二日电】长子由于干部全力深入动员，截至目前止，已将全县麦地犁了一遍，将去年熟荒，补种了晚秋、秋菜等二千九百余亩。此外还新开生荒六百亩，也改种了黑豆、荞麦、软黍、芥菜等，连回茬麦地在内，共有三万六千四百亩。现晚秋蔬菜长得十分茂盛，并已开始锄苗，老百姓莫不喜形于色。一区杨村一老汉说：“共产党领导就是好，要是过去的政府，谁来管这些事！”其所以获得这样的成绩，主要是全县干部深入宣传了四三年灾荒的经验；六区柳树的村干部说：“四三年遭了年灾，村上都没有吃的，可够受制了，今年可不敢再大意啦，多种上些蔬菜，总比没吃的强。”
