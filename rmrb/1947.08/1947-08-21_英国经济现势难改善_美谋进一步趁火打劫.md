　　Britain's Economic Situation Difficult to Improve; US Plots Further Exploitation

　　The British Parliament passed the Attlee "Economic Emergency Measures" enforcement act last week. This has temporarily quelled the storm that had been raging in Parliament for weeks due to economic difficulties. The bill mainly stipulates strengthening control over labor, further reducing people's living standards, and also makes certain control provisions for industry. Fierce debates unfolded during the discussion, leaving the Labor government besieged on all sides. One hundred and fifty Labor MPs and left-wing trade union representatives fiercely criticized the authorities' measures as harsh on labor and lenient on big capital, forcing Attlee to hurriedly convene a secret Labor Party meeting on the 11th to pass "steel nationalization," thereby easing the "dissatisfaction and indignation" within the party. On the other hand, the Conservative Party led by Churchill and a part of the Liberal Party formed an alliance to fiercely criticize certain control provisions for industry, fearing that if the left-wing forces within the Labor Party gained the upper hand, these provisions would be seriously implemented, greatly harming big capital. Churchill even cried out in panic, "A coup could happen at any time in the secret meeting room of the Labor Party." The passage of this bill obviously cannot thoroughly improve Britain's current shattered economic situation unless the Labor government fundamentally changes its current foreign policy and its maintenance of the interests of big capital in domestic affairs.

　　Britain's economic difficulties are being seen by US imperialism as a good opportunity to exploit the situation. Under the scare tactics of the United States, the Anglo-American Ruhr Conference finally began in Washington on the 12th. The progress of the discussions shows that the basic point is still the issue of control over the Ruhr. The US side emphasized the technical incompetence and poor management of the Ruhr coal mines, and further demanded "supervision" of the Ruhr coal mines, "assuming greater responsibility"; in other words, it would be jointly managed by Britain and the United States, but with the United States as the main player. At the same time, the United States, on the one hand, promised Britain to convene a meeting to revise the terms of the Anglo-American loan, but on the other hand, publicly demanded before the meeting that the United States "fully explain" the use of the loan, and stated that it would not discuss the issue of new loans to Britain. This is nothing more than coercing and enticing Britain to submit at the Ruhr Conference and seeking to further encroach on Britain's economic sphere of influence. The British side emphasized the issues of financial exhaustion, severe food shortages, and transportation difficulties, and provided the US side with statistics on Ruhr coal increases to prove that the main problem was not technical or managerial. At the same time, Britain in turn demanded that the British share of expenses in the German occupied zones should be reduced, and the US side should increase its share. At the beginning of the Ruhr Conference, the US side expressed extreme "optimism," but before long, it greatly publicized the "informal nature" of the conference, preparing public opinion for a possibly unfavorable outcome.

　　The long-clamored Pan-American Conference opened in the Brazilian capital on the 15th. This conference, under the smoke screen of anti-communism, was personally presided over by Marshall. The discussion themes were "standardization of armaments" and a "joint defense pact," but its actual purpose was to further place the military, political, and economic affairs of Central and South America under the control and enslavement of US imperialism. On the eve of the conference, the contradictions between the United States and some Central and South American countries had been somewhat revealed. Cuba once refused to participate due to its opposition to further US economic aggression. In order to resist the flood of US goods, Brazil raised tariffs by 70 percent, and Argentina and Chile also announced that they would further restrict the import of US goods. Disputes also arose at the conference over voting procedures. Marshall's strengthening of the Monroe Doctrine towards Central and South America is detrimental not only to the Central and South American countries, but also to Britain, which has traditionally held significant interests in the region. Reuters reporter Gambell's report has already begun to reveal a sense of dissatisfaction.

　　In addition, on the 14th, the United States formally rejected the Soviet Union's positive suggestion that the four powers should first consult on the Japanese peace treaty, and stubbornly insisted on unilaterally convening a Far Eastern eleven-nation conference in September, attempting to manipulate the majority so that the Japanese peace treaty would become a legal regulation for the United States to monopolize Japan. However, the holding of this conference will inevitably promote serious entanglements between the United States and other allies, especially Britain and its dominions.

　　The international events of the past week symbolize the development of the international situation centered on the contradictions between Britain and the United States.

### 英国经济现势难改善　美谋进一步趁火打劫

　　英国经济现势难改善　美谋进一步趁火打劫
    英议会已于上周通过了艾德礼“经济紧急措施”的执行法。这使数周来因经济困难而在议会中掀起的惊涛骇浪，暂时潜伏下去。该法案主要规定加强管制劳工，更加降低人民生活水准，而对工业也作了某些管制的规定。在讨论中曾展开了激烈的辩论，使工党政府陷于四面楚歌。一百五十名工党议员及左翼工会代表猛烈批评当局之措施对劳工苛刻而对大资本宽容，迫使艾德礼急急忙忙于十一日召集工党秘密会议，通过“钢铁国有化”，借此缓和其内部“不满与激愤的情绪”。另一方面，以邱吉尔为首的保守党与一部分自由党结成联盟，对工业的某些管制等规定大肆抨击，深恐一旦工党内部左翼势力占优势时，会使这些规定认真实行而大大不利于大资本；邱吉尔甚至惊惶万状的大呼大叫：“任何时候政变都可能在工党的秘密会议室中发生”。这一法案的通过，显然并不能彻底改善英国目前破碎的经济形势，除非根本改变工党政府现行外交政策及内政方面对大资本利益的维护。
    英国的经济困难，正被美帝国主义认为是趁火打劫的好机会。在美国的吓骗下，英美鲁尔会议终于十二日在华府开始，讨论进程显示：基本点还是鲁尔的控制权问题。美方强调鲁尔煤矿之技术低能和管理不善，进而要求对鲁尔煤矿之“监督”，“担负起更大责任”；换言之，就是由英美共同管制，而以美国为主。同时，美国又一方面允诺英国召开修改英美贷款条件会议，但另一方面又于会前公开要求美国“充分解释”贷款用途，并表示不谈对英新贷款问题。这无非是威迫与引诱英国在鲁尔会议中就范，并谋进一步的侵入英国经济势力圈。英国方面则强调财政枯竭，食粮奇缺与运输困难问题并向美方提供鲁尔煤增的统计数字，以证明主要不是技术与管理问题。同时，英国又反过来要求在德占区经费中英方负担应减少，而美方应增加。鲁尔会议召开初时，美方曾表示极为“乐观”，但曾几何时，却大事宣传会议的“非正式性质”，作万一不吉利收场的舆论准备了。
    喧嚷已久的泛美会议，十五日已在巴西京城开幕。这一会议是在反共烟幕下，由马歇尔亲自主持的。讨论主题为“军备标准化”与“联防公约”，但其实际目的，则是进一步把中南美之军事、政治、经济置于美帝国主义控制与奴役下。会议召开前夕，美国与中南美某些国家间之矛盾多少已表露出来。古巴因反对美进一步的经济侵略，曾一度拒绝参加。为了抵制美货之泛滥，巴西提高关税百分之七十，阿根廷与智利亦宣布要进一步限制美货入口。在会上，对表决程序也发生了争执。马歇尔对中南美加强门罗主义，其受害者，不仅是中南美诸国，而且是在该地素拥重大利益的英国。路透社记者甘贝尔的报导，已开始透露了不满的情绪。
    此外，美国于十四日正式拒绝苏联对日和约应先由四强协商之积极建议，而固执于九月间片面召开远东十一国会议，力图操纵多数，使对日和约成为美独占日本的合法规章。但这一会议之举行，势将促进美国与其他盟国，特别是英国及其自治领间的严重纠葛。
    一周来的国际大事，象征着以英美矛盾为中心的国际形势之发展。
