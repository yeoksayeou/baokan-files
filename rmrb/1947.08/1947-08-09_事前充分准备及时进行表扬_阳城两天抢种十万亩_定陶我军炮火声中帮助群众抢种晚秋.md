    Fully Prepare in Advance and Give Timely Praise
    Yangcheng Rushes to Plant 100,000 Mu in Two Days
    In Dingtao, Our Army Helps the Masses Rush to Plant Late Autumn Crops Amidst the Sound of Artillery Fire
    [Reported from Taiyue on the 7th] Yangcheng's 250,000 farmers, in the two days of the 30th and 31st of last month, fully rushed to plant and replant over 100,000 mu of land. Among them, the eliminated wasteland reached over 4,000 mu. To increase production further, they are continuing to reduce untilled land. The speed and magnitude of this rush planting are due to the following reasons: First, in-depth mobilization was carried out beforehand, and forces were specifically organized. Therefore, after the rain, the whole village worked the land, the whole group worked the land, and the whole family worked the land. For example, in Yang Wenrui's mutual aid group in Fuzhe Village, Fourth District, 15 people, 3 seed drills, and 9 cattle were all on the land. Five people plowed and sowed, working together, and rushing to plant 32 mu in half a day. Zhang Xiaomo, a woman from Hanshang, and a twelve-year-old child pulled the seed drill, rushing to plant 3 mu in half a day. The joint industrial, agricultural, and commercial union in Chengguan went to the fields to rush planting. Turned-over small merchants such as Cheng Fucheng and others, 14 people in total, automatically helped turned-over farmers rush to plant 15 mu in one day on the 31st. They said, "Winning the battle in production guarantees the victory of the counter-offensive!" Zhang Xun Village in the Seventh District specifically proposed methods such as "filling large gaps with turnips, mung beans, and buckwheat, and filling small gaps with radishes." Second, late-maturing seeds were planned and adjusted. The Fourth District United Cooperative alone promptly adjusted 14 shi of buckwheat seeds. Various mutual aid groups also adjusted among themselves, solving the seed shortage. Third, timely commendation and rewards promoted the movement. The County Production and War Support Merit Committee specially stipulated several reward methods: (1) For any wasteland left uncultivated, now rushing to plant late autumn crops, land with an original yield of less than four dou, no burden will be imposed this autumn; (2) Households that eliminate more than two mu of untilled land will be credited by the village Production and War Support Committee or given material rewards; groups that eliminate more than five mu of untilled land and rush to plant late autumn crops will be credited and commended by the district; administrative villages that eliminate more than thirty mu of untilled land and rush to plant late autumn crops will be rewarded by the county.
    [Reported from the Jilu Yu Frontline] As our army encircled and annihilated the Chiang Kai-shek troops in Dingtao, heavy rain fell universally at night. In the midst of intense fighting, a certain directly subordinate team of our army spared as many people and animals as possible to help the local folks rush to plant 209.6 mu of late autumn crops. The folks were immensely grateful and told us one after another, "Since the Central Army occupied this place, the landlords settled old scores, and the former members of the Farmers' Association were likely to be arrested and buried alive. Back in the countryside, the gangs openly robbed and extorted money at will. The Central Army cut down trees (to make barricades and chevaux-de-frise), caught chickens, and slaughtered pigs. The young women in the nearby villages were all @ trampled on. They urged the payment of money, food, and firewood, regardless of the life or death of the farmers. If they were not satisfied, they would slap them in the face. This was not all; they also forced the people to pull out the sorghum that was almost ready to harvest (sorghum is the main product here). Many families, after pulling it out, were about to starve to death, and the whole family cried in pain, unable to eat for two or three days. The weather was extremely dry, and not even a single bean could be planted, and sweet potatoes could not be planted. The farmers really couldn't survive, and secretly hoped that the Eighth Route Army would come to the rescue soon. The Eighth Route Army came, not only rescued the people but also brought the rain that they had been longing for. The sorghum that had not been pulled out was saved, and the pulled-out sorghum could be replanted. It's really..." (Lian Yunshan)

    事前充分准备及时进行表扬
    阳城两天抢种十万亩
    定陶我军炮火声中帮助群众抢种晚秋
    【本报太岳七日电】阳城二十五万农民，于上月卅日、三十一日两天内，全力抢种补种十万余亩土地，其中消灭的白地即达四千余亩，为更多增产，现正继续消减熟荒。此次抢种之快，收获之大，有以下几个原因：第一、事前作了深入动员，具体组织了力量，因此雨后便做到全村上地，全组上地，全家上地。如四区府泽村杨文瑞互助组，十五人三张耧九头牛全部下地，五人一张犁耩地，一齐过，一晌抢种三十二亩；汉上妇女张小末和十二岁小孩拉耧，一晌抢种三亩；城关工农商大联合，下地抢种，翻身小商人成福成等十四人，三十一日一天内，自动帮助翻身农民抢种了十五亩，他们说：“生产上打胜仗，反攻胜利有保证！”七区张训村更具体提出“大空补蔓菁绿豆荞麦，小空补萝卜”等办法。第二、是有计划的调剂了晚种籽，仅四区联合社，即及时调剂了荞麦籽十四石。各互助组也多自相调剂，解决了种籽困难。第三、是及时表扬奖励，推动运动。县生产参战立功委员会，特别规定了奖励办法数项：（一）凡遗留未种荒地，现在赶种晚秋，原产量在四斗以下之地，今秋不负担；（二）每户消灭熟荒在二亩以上者，由村生产参战委员会记功，或给予物质奖励；每小组消灭熟荒赶种晚秋在五亩以上者，由区记功表扬；每行政村消灭熟荒赶种晚秋在三十亩以上者，由县给予奖励。
    【本报冀鲁豫前线讯】随着我军围歼定陶蒋军之夜大雨普降，在紧张的战斗中，我某直属队抽出仅可能的人畜帮驻地老乡抢种晚秋作物二百零九亩六分，老乡感激莫名，纷纷诉说：“自中央军占后，地主倒算，过去的农会员，说不定那时被捉去活埋，还乡下，杆子会明抢明夺，随意讹人勒索，中央军砍树（作鹿砦拒马用）捉鸡杀猪，附近村的青年娘们，全被＠踏了，催款要粮要柴火，不管庄稼人死活，一不顺意，便要挨耳光，这还不算，还强迫把快到口的高粱拔掉（这里高粱是主要产品），不少户拔掉后眼看就要饿死，全家痛哭，两三天吃不进饭，天气大旱，连粒豆子不能种，红薯不能栽，庄稼人实在活不下去了哇，暗中盼八路军快来救命，八路军来了，救下了百姓不说，随带来盼不到的雨，没拔的高粱保住了，拔了的还能补种上，真是……………。”（连云山）
