　　“The ground freezes, cart wheels sound, radishes and turnips grow long.” Under this slogan, the masses in the Second District of Yangcheng are rushing to plant 1,005 mu of autumn vegetables. At the replanting and rush-planting meeting held in the district on the 13th, the leadership put forward the call to "eliminate cultivated wasteland and then plant late vegetables." The cadres and masses in various villages did not have much confidence in this, and generally reflected, "Now that it's the beginning of autumn, I'm afraid they won't grow big!" "The wasteland is far away and bad, and planting it won't even cover the labor costs!" However, after in-depth discussions by the masses, these issues were resolved one by one. For example, Duan Jieyi from Shuiquangou said, "It's not too late to plant vegetables now." As the saying goes, "The ground freezes, cart wheels sound, radishes and turnips grow long!" "If the top doesn't grow, the bottom will." The masses in Dongshan Village used "three advantages of replanting" to get through ideological barriers. The three advantages are: first, eating vegetables in the autumn; second, eating grain in the spring; and third, saving vegetables for seed in the autumn and summer. Women in Zhangxun Village put forward the slogan "Eliminate cultivated wasteland for three gains in one stroke," meaning that pulling up artemisia and burning it into ash to make ammunition to fight Chiang Kai-shek is the first gain, reclaiming wasteland is the second gain, and planting vegetables to get through the barren period is the third gain. As a result, each group and each person challenged each other, forming a surge of wasteland reclamation. Yan Xiaochuan, a military dependent woman from Mashan Village, challenged her husband after returning home from the meeting. When her husband didn't accept the challenge, she led eight women, carrying hoes, up the mountain to reclaim wasteland, which motivated the men to go to the fields as well, planting one and a half mu of vegetables. Wang Xiaogan, a farmer from Tanpo, and his wife planted three mu of vegetables in one day. Yang Yan and Wei Junyu's mutual aid team in Xizhang Village planted vegetables on all the small plots of land and corners of the village, achieving an average of one and a half mu of autumn vegetables planted per household.

　　地冻车轮响　萝卜蔓菁长
  　阳城二区抢种晚菜千亩
    【本报太岳二十六日电】“地冻车轮响，萝卜蔓菁长”。阳城二区群众在此口号下，抢种秋菜一千零五亩。该区十三日汇报补种抢种会上，领导上提出“消灭熟荒再种晚菜”号召，各村干部群众对此没多大信心，普遍反映说：“现在立了秋，恐怕种上长不大！”“荒地又远又不好，种上打的不够工钱！”但经群众深入讨论后，都一一得到解决，例如水泉沟段接义说：“现在种菜还不迟”，俗语常说：“地冻车轮响，萝卜蔓菁长！”“上边不长下边长”。东山村群众用“再种三好”打通了思想，三好是：一好秋后吃菜、二好春天吃粮、三好剩下菜，秋夏天打籽。章训村妇女提出“消灭熟荒，一举三得”的口号，意思是拔了蒿烧成灰造军火打老蒋是一得、开了荒是二得、种上菜渡了荒是三得。由此各组各人互相挑战，形成开荒热潮。马山村军属妇女延小传，开完会回家与男人挑战，她男人没应战，她就领着八个妇女扛上镢头上山开荒，这样推动男人也上了地，种了亩半菜。滩坡农民王小乾，两口子一天种了三亩菜。西章村杨奄，卫俊毓互助组，把村外小块地房圪落都种上了菜，又作到了一户平均种一亩半秋菜。
