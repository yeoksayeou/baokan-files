　　Basic Experiences of Guerrilla Warfare in the Past Year
  　Summary of Comrade Cao Pu's Report from the Taiyue Military Sub-district
    (1) Land reform is the foundation for carrying out guerrilla warfare. The experience of the past year proves that without land reform and the emancipation of the broad masses, the development of mass guerrilla warfare is unimaginable. Conversely, once guerrilla warfare is combined with land reform and with opposition to land redistribution reversals, guerrilla warfare can develop vigorously, showing unlimited vitality. This is the fundamental issue of our guerrilla warfare, the issue of the nature of guerrilla warfare, and the key to carrying out guerrilla warfare. For example, in some areas of Ji(yuan) Meng(county), at the beginning of guerrilla warfare, because it was not combined with land reform, it was purely military activity, and the masses' enthusiasm for struggle could not be raised, and the movement could not be widely carried out. Later, the slogan of opposing land redistribution reversals was put forward, and the ringleaders of the land redistribution reversals were suppressed. Then guerrilla warfare began to develop vigorously. From land to water, from Hebei to Henan, the flames of guerrilla warfare were ignited everywhere. Such realistic and insightful experiences and lessons are largely similar everywhere.
    Therefore, the construction of people's armed forces must be based on the emancipation of the peasants. Experience shows that premature arming of peasants is not solid; the best process for the peasants' emancipation is also the process of arming the peasants. Therefore, comrades of the Armed Forces Committee must participate in the land reform movement. In the past, the Armed Forces Committee in the heartland areas devoted 80 percent of its efforts to the land reform movement, which was entirely correct. In the future, in the new areas, the Armed Forces Committee should devote all its efforts to participating in the mass emancipation movement, and in the process of the movement, cooperate with the comrades of the Farmers' Association, and everyone should work together to develop the militia and establish the people's own armed forces.
    Therefore, guerrilla warfare must be combined with the urgent demands of the masses and with the immediate interests of the masses. The experience of the past year proves that wherever the movement to oppose land redistribution reversals (which was the most urgent demand of the masses at that time) was launched, guerrilla warfare was generally carried out; otherwise, simply relying on guns to conquer the world would inevitably lead to "two armies facing each other, with the masses watching." Whatever the masses want to do, we will do. This is our action guideline. In order to protect the interests of the masses and combine them with the long-term and fundamental interests of the masses, guerrilla warfare cannot remain at the stage of opposing land redistribution reversals, and cannot be satisfied with protecting the immediate interests of the masses. It must also strive for the complete emancipation of the masses. Therefore, all forces should be organized and pushed towards enemy strongholds to cover the land reform, and the struggle to end Chiang Kai-shek's traitorous and dictatorial rule should be combined with the struggle to defeat "Little Chiang" (the landlord class). The militia of Sheba Lian not only protected the masses of their own village in implementing "land to the tillers," but also pushed our position forward to one mile away from Potou (enemy stronghold) to help neighboring villages carry out land reform. This should become the direction for our entire region to learn from.
    (2) On the policy of persistence. The experience of the past year proves that wherever the policy of persistence is adopted under the enemy's large-scale offensive, and the policy of cadres not leaving the militia and the militia not leaving the masses is adopted, it is possible to rely on the strength of the masses to achieve the purpose of stopping the enemy and maintaining the vast rural areas. Otherwise, either shrinking back and running away, or disorganizing the militia and dispersing them in the countryside for simple concealment, canceling the struggle against the enemy, has resulted in serious losses. The Xiangling militia, in an area of forty li in radius, resolutely relied on the masses and smashed seven "encirclements and suppressions" by the enemy's forces of more than one regiment, becoming a glorious banner for our region in adhering to the struggle behind enemy lines.
    But how to persist? Not to defend the position to the death, not to concentrate forces to resist head-on, and even less to simply engage in naked dancing on the military level. Rather, under the policy of closely relying on the masses, in areas where the enemy is pressing down, before the enemy has gained a firm foothold, has been able to universally "reverse the land redistribution" and restore its feudal rule, reactionary ringleaders should be suppressed in a timely manner to cut off the enemy's claws and defeat its foundation for survival – the feudal landlords, gentry, and bullies. The Hongdong militia retreated under the advance of seven brigades of the enemy, and after three to five days, they attacked back in small groups, reconnoitered the enemy, contacted the masses, and suppressed the ringleaders of the land redistribution reversals, thereby opening up the situation, persisting in the position, and expanding the liberated area, creating valuable experience and glorious achievements on how to persist.
    (3) On tactical issues. The guiding principle of tactics is to follow the mass line and promote the wisdom and creativity of the masses, so that "eight immortals cross the sea, each showing their unique abilities." The experience of the past year proves that the masses have unlimited wisdom, and there are countless "Zhuge Liangs" among the masses. As long as this wisdom and creativity can be promoted and implemented, bravery can be combined with wisdom, and enemies who memorize drill manuals will be at a loss and easily captured. Over the past year, various places have gained rich experience in tactics, and the creations of the Hongdong militia in this regard are particularly brilliant, rich, and complete, and worthy of everyone's study.
    After a year of exploration, the following three principles must be grasped in tactics: First, we must take the initiative to attack and avoid being passive. If the enemy advances, we advance; if the enemy does not advance, we also advance. We must fight tit-for-tat and resolutely struggle. Even if we are temporarily placed in a passive position under the enemy's superior forces, we should promptly find ways to restore the initiative and seek opportunities to strike the enemy. Second, the basic principle is to fight in a decentralized manner, and to appropriately concentrate forces when necessary. Third, we must combine wisdom and bravery, and spend more effort thinking of ways to overcome reckless charging and simple, desperate fighting. To achieve this goal, thunder is the most important and best means of struggle.
    Based on the above principles, we have created many tactics in the past year: namely, the explosion war, the cold gun war, the combination of thunder and gun war, the joint defense station, the camouflage war, the assault war, the heart-picking war, the small-scale annihilation war, the siege war, the intimidation war, and the water guerrilla war. The experience of the past year proves that wherever these tactics can be adopted flexibly and adapted to local conditions, it will be possible to kill and wound a large number of enemies at a small cost. Although the tactics created by the masses each have their own "mysteries," the explosion war is particularly a "low-cost tactic with high profits." Shang Qingfu of Hongdong has created the most in this area, and can be called the explosion flag-bearer of the entire region. Everyone should learn from Shang Qingfu to further apply this "low-cost tactic" to various battlefields.

　　一年来游击战争基本经验
  　太岳武总曹普同志总结报告提要
    （一）土地改革是开展游击战争的基矗一年来的经验证明，没有土地改革，没有广大群众的翻身，群众游击战争的展开是不可想象的。相反的，游击战争一旦与土地改革结合起来？与反倒算结合起来，游击战争便能如火如荼的发展，涌现出无限的活力。这是我们游击战的基础问题，是游击战争的性质问题，是开展游击战争的锁。如济（源）孟（县）有些地区，游击战争开展之初，因为没有与土地改革相结合，单纯军事活动，群众斗争情绪提不高，运动不能广泛开展起来。后来提出反倒算，镇压了倒算祸首，游击战争便蓬蓬勃勃的展开了。从陆地到水上，从河北到河南，到处燃起游击战争烽火，这种现实的洞若观火的经验教训，各地都大同小异。
    因此人民武装的建设，必须要建立在农民的翻身基础之上。经验证明，过早的武装农民，基础是不巩固的；最好农民翻身的过程，就是武装农民的过程，所以武委会的同志必须参加土改运动。过去腹心地区武委会曾以百分之八十的力量投入土改运动，是完全正确的。今后在新区，武委会更应以全部的力量，参加群众翻身运动，并在运动的过程中，协同农会同志，大家动手，发展民兵，建立人民自己的武装。
    因此，游击战争必须为群众迫切的要求相结合，与群众眼前的利益相结合。一年来的经验证明，那里展开反倒算运动（这是当时群众最迫切的要求），那里的游击战争便普遍开展，否则单纯靠枪杆打天下，必然造成“两军对阵、群众旁观”。群众要干啥，我们就干啥，这便是我们行动的方针。为了卫护群众的利益，与群众的长远的基本的利益相结合，游击战争不能停留在反倒算阶段，不能满足于卫护了群众的眼前利益，还必须为群众彻底翻身而努力，所以应当组织一切力量，推向敌人据点，以掩护土地改革的进行，把结束蒋介石卖国独裁统治与打垮“小蒋”（地主阶级）的斗争结合起来。社八联的民兵，不仅掩护本村群众实行了耕者有其田，而且将我们阵地推向前去，直达离坡头（敌据点）一里的地方，以帮助邻村进行土地改革，应成为我们全区学习的方向。
    （二）关于坚持的方针。一年来的经验证明，在敌人大举进攻下，那里采取了坚持的方针，采取了干部不离民兵，民兵不离群众的方针，就能够依靠群众的力量，达到阻止敌人，坚持广大农村阵地的目的。否则，或畏缩逃跑，或将民兵无组织的分散在农村单纯隐蔽，取消对敌斗争，都遭遇了严重的损失。襄陵民兵在方圆四十里大的地方，由于坚决依靠群众，粉碎了敌人一个团以上兵力的七次“围剿”，成为我区坚持敌后斗争的一面光辉旗帜。
    但怎样坚持呢？不是死守阵地，不是集中力量硬顶，更不是单纯军事上的裸体跳舞。而是在紧紧依靠群众的方针下，在敌军压境的地区，趁敌立足未稳、没能普遍“倒算”及恢复其封建统治以前，及时进行镇压反动祸首，以斩断敌人的魔爪，打垮其生存的基础——封建地主、豪绅、奸霸。洪洞民兵在七个旅的敌人的推进下转出，三五天后即小股打回去，侦察了敌人，联系了群众，镇压了倒算祸首，从而便打开了局面，坚持了阵地，扩大了解放区，对如何坚持，创造了宝贵的经验与光辉的成绩。
    （三）关于战术问题。战术指导的方针，就是走群众路线，发扬群众的智慧创造，使“八仙过海、各显神通”。一年来的经验证明，群众无限的智谋，群众中有无数的“诸葛亮”，只要能将这些智慧与创造发扬起来，贯澈下去，就能使勇敢与智谋结合起来，就能使熟记操典之类的敌人手足无措，束手就擒。一年来，各地在战术上都获取了丰富的经验，而洪洞民兵在这方面的创造尤为精彩丰富与完整，值得大家研究学习。
    经过一年的摸索，在战术上必须掌握这样三个原则：一、必须主动出击，避免被动，敌进我进，敌不进我亦进，针锋相对，坚决斗争；即使在敌人优势兵力下一时陷于被动，亦应及时设法恢复主动，寻机打击敌人。二、基本是分散作战，必要时适当集中的使用力量。三、智雷勇结合，多费脑筋想办法，克服猛冲猛打，单纯死拚的干法。而要达到这个目的，雷是最主要的最好的斗争手段。
    根据上述的原则，一年来我们创造了很多战法：即爆炸战、冷枪战、雷枪结合战、联防站、伪装战、突击战、掏心战、小型消灭战、围困战、恐吓战、水上游击战。一年来的经验证明，那里能机动灵活，因地制宜的采取上述的战法，那里就能以小的代价杀伤大量的敌人。群众所创造的战法，虽各有“奥妙”，而尤以爆炸战为“一本万利的廉价战法。”洪洞尚清福在这方面创造最多，堪称全区的爆炸旗手，大家应很好的向尚清福学习，以进一步将这种“廉价战法”运应到各个战场上去。
