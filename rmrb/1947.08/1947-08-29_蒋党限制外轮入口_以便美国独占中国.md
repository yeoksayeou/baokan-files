Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, August 27th: According to news from Hong Kong on the 24th, the measures determined by the Chiang government to accommodate the interests of the US in monopolizing Chinese ports regarding the entry of foreign merchant ships into Chinese ports have now begun to be implemented. The measures stipulate that foreign merchant ships entering more than one Chinese port are limited until March 31st of this year, with the exception of those that have "reciprocal" treaties with the Chiang government. The British side in Kowloon has received notification regarding the implementation of these measures, which were issued by Li Du, the American head of the Chiang-controlled Customs General Administration. The notification specifically emphasizes that "merchant ships of countries with 'reciprocal' treaties may continue to enter more than one Chinese port after March 31st of the 36th year [1947]". Under this provision, only the United States enjoys the "privilege of entering more than one Chinese port," because so far only the United States has a "reciprocal" agreement with the Chiang government. However, apart from the United States, under the protection of the United States, Japanese ships can continue to enter and exit Chinese ports. Because in February of this year, the Chiang regime's Executive Yuan passed a "Measures for the Import of Merchant Ships from Countries Without Customs Privileges." Under this kind of customs "permit" system controlled by Americans, the entry and exit of Japanese merchant ships to Chinese ports is "legally" guaranteed.

　　蒋党限制外轮入口　以便美国独占中国
    【新华社陕北二十七日电】据香港二十四日消息：前经蒋政府确定的适应美国独占中国港口利益的外国商轮入中国港口办法，现已开始实施办法规定外国商轮进入一个以上之中国港口，限至今年三月三十一日为止，但与蒋政府订有“互惠”条约者例外。九龙英国方面已接获关于实施此项办法之通知，该办法系由蒋记海关总税务司美人李度所发出，通知中特别强调“凡有‘互惠’条约国家之商船，在三十六年三月三十一日以后，得继续进入一个以上之中国港口”。在此一规定下，只有美国才享有“进入一个以上中国港口的特权”，因迄今为止只有美国与蒋政府订有“互惠”协定。不过除美国以外，在美国庇护之下，日本船只当可继续进出中国港口。因今年二月蒋记行政院曾通过一“海关特权无约国商船进口办法”，在此种为美国人把持的海关“特许”制度下，日本商船进出中国港口即得到“合法”之保障。
