　　Wang Anguo Model Platoon
　　After Wang Anguo of a certain brigade of the Jinan People's Liberation Army gave a report at the political work conference, everyone unanimously said they wanted to learn from him. Indeed, Wang Anguo performed admirably in combat, training, consolidating the troops, and in his relations with the people, making him an outstanding model platoon in the entire brigade.

　　Wang Anguo had been in the army for three years. Because of his rapid progress, high level of class consciousness, consistent bravery in battle, and active work, he joined the Communist Party last January and was promoted to squad leader of the eighth squad of the ninth company of the fourth regiment in October. Since becoming squad leader, he has worked even more actively, treating his comrades like his own brothers. The entire squad is as united as a harmonious family. In the entire eight months or so, there have been no desertions and no cases of illness.

　　After the launch of the movement to defend Chairman Mao, the troops departed from Yangcheng. The higher-ups called for achieving three goods: fighting well, consolidating the troops well, and enforcing discipline towards the masses on the battlefield well. Wang Anguo's squad resoundingly responded to this call. They discussed as a squad: "To fight well, we must have good skills." So Wang Anguo proposed to everyone: during the march, we must achieve three practices: practice throwing three grenades, aiming three shots, and thrusting three times with the bayonet. Everyone agreed, and during the daily march of eighty or ninety li, they indeed achieved this. Especially in terms of discipline towards the masses, they ensured that they wouldn't leave until the water jars were full, the ground was swept clean, and anything borrowed was returned, and anything damaged was compensated for.

　　After the troops descended the mountains, they would soon enter the battle of Quwo. Wang Anguo said, "Regardless of whether we are called to fight or not, we must be prepared." He led everyone in actively preparing, and discussing entry discipline to ensure empty entry and empty exit, no hanging of threads, and established a combat plan to replace the squad's weapons with new rifles.

　　On the evening of April 15th, the battle to attack Quwo began. Countless shells flew towards the city walls, bunkers exploded, and enemy corpses and shrapnel flew wildly in the air. Gunfire roared, and this "copper wall and iron fortress" trembled before the soldiers of General Chen Geng.

　　Wang Anguo led his soldiers to the bottom of the city gate tower, where they discovered a hole blasted open by the sappers. He made it bigger, threw two hand grenades inside, and was the first to charge in. Then, soldiers Chen Xinzhi and Li Wenquan followed. The enemy on the city tower noticed and asked, "Which unit?" Wang Anguo responded quickly, "Ninth Regiment!" The enemy asked again, "Is it the first company?" He replied, "Yes!" As he spoke, he told the soldiers to hide in the west courtyard. At this time, an enemy soldier came over close to the west city wall, carrying a gun. Wang Anguo pounced on him, seized the gun, captured the prisoner, and learned that there was a hidden bunker nearby. Wang Anguo went west alone with hand grenades and soon brought back three prisoners and three rifles. At this time, the enemy inside the west city wall noticed, and a platoon-sized force, throwing bombs, firing machine guns, and shouting, charged towards them. Wang Anguo's squad only had six or seven people, two rifles, and one hand grenade. The situation was extremely critical. Wang Anguo thought: We must persevere; only by repelling the enemy can we survive. Otherwise, if we waver, we will be annihilated by the enemy. At this moment, he strongly encouraged everyone, saying, "Comrades! We are serving the people. It is glorious even to sacrifice ourselves. Chen Xinzhi and Li Wenquan, you two aim and fire with your rifles, and I will throw grenades. We must not let the enemy charge over, even if we die!" This resolute and powerful slogan increased everyone's confidence and strength. What followed was a fierce battle. At dawn, the hateful enemy approached, and the platoon leader also sent hand grenades. They threw a barrage of hand grenades, repelling the enemy. But then they were driven by their officers, crawling over like turtles, four times in a row, they vainly attempted to swallow these few indomitable heroes in one gulp, but each time they were beaten back. The enemy left piles of corpses and colored flags, and dared not come over again.

　　Wang Anguo's squad was like iron and steel, becoming harder the more they fought. The company commander ordered them to clear the enemy from the west city wall, and he and Li Xuebin went with hand grenades. The enemy's machine gun in the northwest corner of the city wall fired madly at them, but Wang Anguo, relying on his bravery and resourcefulness, successively destroyed two enemy bunkers, captured seven enemies, and seized five rifles. Wang Anguo threatened the enemy with firepower while attacking their morale by shouting. In the third bunker, he captured another five enemies and seized five rifles. In the fourth bunker, Wang Anguo persuaded eight enemies to surrender and seized five rifles.

　　During the battle summary, Wang Anguo's soldiers were praised as being three-good. The entire eighth squad of seven people were awarded the title of hero. Tempered by the battle of Quwo, Wang Anguo's squad was like a blooming flower, fragrant wherever it went. The regiment and brigade launched the Wang Anguo movement, calling on everyone to learn from them and create more Wang Anguo squads. But Wang Anguo was not proud. On the contrary, he became more active and humble. During the large-scale training, Wang Anguo's squad continued to maintain the three-good standards.

　　The troops moved to Qiaoyang Village, which was a new district in Yishi and had never housed the Eighth Route Army. The villagers didn't understand the Eighth Route Army and thought they were like the Japanese and Yan Xishan's troops, so they kept their doors tightly shut. When Wang Anguo arrived at the garrison, he settled the troops outside first. He then gently patted the door knocker, called out politely, and opened the door himself. After he had checked the house, he came out to lead everyone in. The villagers only had one straw mat left, and everyone was packing their bags, preparing to sleep. Only Meng Chunbao, a newly liberated soldier, was unhappy. He said, "Soldiers don't even have a quilt to cover themselves!" He went to borrow a quilt from the villagers, but the villagers were afraid of being treated like those other troops and refused to lend him one. Meng Chunbao started to argue. Wang Anguo heard this and quickly called him back, criticizing him: "Have you forgotten that we are the three-good eighth squad? How can you treat the villagers like that? That's not good. You must pay attention in the future!" After speaking, he went to apologize to the villagers. As soon as he left, Chunbao rolled his eyes and started to complain. Wang Anguo knew that he was new to the Liberation Army and not used to the life, so he went back, shook out his quilt, and said to Chunbao with concern: "Chunbao! Cover yourself with my quilt." Seeing that the squad leader cared for him so much, Chunbao regretted the strange things he had just said. He said: "The higher-ups and everyone else are always talking about observing discipline towards the masses. I was wrong! In the future, I will do nothing without the squad leader's permission. I won't do anything the squad leader tells me not to do." Since the troops arrived at the villagers' home, they went out every day before dawn to practice and attend classes, and the house was kept tidy and clean. The yard was so swept that you could see a needle drop on the ground. The villagers really felt a little strange. This troop was really disciplined; they were all young people, how could they not make noise all day? The villagers began to treat Wang Anguo's squad well and would lend them anything they needed.

### 王安国模范班

　　王安国模范班
    晋南人民解放军某旅王安国，在政工会议上作了报告以后，大家都异口同声的说要向他学习。是的，王安国无论在战斗中，练兵中，巩固部队上，军民关系上，都作的漂亮，是全旅出色的模范班。
    王安国到部队里已经三年了，因为他进步的快，有高度的阶级觉悟，一向英勇善战，积极工作，去年一月参加了共产党，十月被提升为四团九连的八班长。自从他当班长以后，工作更加积极，对待班里同志象亲兄弟一样，全班团结的象一个和睦的家庭，整个八个多月中没有发生过逃亡，没有发生过病号。
    开展保卫毛主席运动以后，队伍从阳城出发了，上级号召作到三好：仗要打好，部队巩固好，战场与群众纪律执行的好。王安国班响亮的响应了这一号召，他们班大家商量：“要打好，没有好技术可不算话”。于是王安国给大家提出：在行军中要作到三练：练三弹，瞄三枪，刺三枪。大家一致同意，在每天八九十里的行军中，确实作到了这点。尤其在群众纪律上，作到了水缸不满不走，地不扫不走，东西借了不还、坏了不赔不走。
    队伍下山以后，很快就要进入曲沃战斗了。王安国说：“不管叫打不叫打，反正要准备好。”他便领导大家积极作准备工作，并讨论入城纪律保证空进空出，针线不挂，订好作战计划，要给全班换新枪。
    四月十五那天黄昏，攻打曲沃的战斗开始了。无数颗炮弹飞向城楼，碉堡爆炸着敌人的尸体和弹片在空中乱飞，枪声响成一片，这座“铜墙铁壁”，在陈赓将军的战士们面前发抖了。
    王安国带着他的战士们冲到城门楼下，发现被工兵炸开的一个洞口，他把它再弄大一些，往里面扔了两个手榴弹，他就第一个冲了进去。接着，战士陈新芝、李文全也跟了进去。城楼上敌人发觉了，问：“哪一部分？”王安国随机应变的答：“保九团！”敌人又问：“是一连吗？”他答：“是！”说着，他就叫战士们往西边院子里隐蔽。这时，靠着西城墙过来了一个敌人，手里提着枪，王安国猛扑过去，缴了一支枪，捉了一个俘虏，又了解附近还有个暗碉，王安国一个人带手榴弹向西扑去，不一会就带回三个俘虏，和三支枪。这时，西城墙里面的敌人发觉了，有一个排的模样，扔着炸弹，打着机枪，叫喊着向他们扑来。王安国班只有六七个人，两支步枪和一颗手榴弹。情况万分紧急，王安国想：我们必须坚持，只有把敌人打退；不然，动摇就得被敌人消灭。在这时，他坚强的鼓动着大家说：“同志们！我们为人民服务，牺牲了也是光荣的，陈新芝、李文全你俩用步枪瞄准坚决打，我投弹，死也不能让敌人冲过来。”这坚决有力的口号，给大家增加了信心和力量。接着，就是一场激烈的战斗。天亮后，该死的敌人迫近了，排长把手榴弹也送来了，他们一阵手榴弹，把敌人打退了。但是接着被他们的长官们又驱赶着，象乌龟一样爬过来，接连四次，他们妄想一口气吞掉这几个不屈的英雄，可是每次都被打了回去。敌人扔下了一堆堆尸首和彩号，再也不敢过来了。
    王安国班象铁象钢，越打越硬。连长命令他们肃清西城墙的敌人，他和李学斌提着手榴弹就走。城西北角的碉堡里敌人的机枪，疯狂的向他们射击着，可是王安国凭着他的英勇机智，接连消灭了敌人两个碉堡，抓了七个敌人，缴了五支枪。王安国一面以火力威胁着敌人，一面以喊话攻心。在第三个碉堡里又捉了五个敌人，缴了五支枪。在第四个碉堡，王安国用喊话争取了八个敌人，缴了五支步枪。
    战斗总结时，王安国的战士们被誉为三好，第八班全班七个人，都荣获了英雄衔。经过曲沃战斗的锻炼，王安国班象一朵盛开的鲜花，走到哪里哪里香。团里旅里都展开了王安国运动，号召向他们学习，创造更多的王安国班。但是王安国并不骄傲，反而更加积极虚心。在大练兵中，王安国班继续保持了三好。
    队伍转移到桥杨村，这是猗氏新区，没住过八路军，老乡不了解八路军，以为象日本和阎锡山的队伍一样，都紧闭了大门。王安国到了驻地，把队伍先安顿在外面，自己先轻轻的拍着门环，和气的叫开了门，自己先进去看好了房子，才出来把大家领进去，老乡腾得只剩下一条席子，大家都收拾着行李准备睡觉。独有刚来的解放战士孟春保却不高兴，他说：“当兵的到那里还没有被子盖啦！”他就去向老乡借被子，可是老乡怕和过去那些队伍一样，死活不借，孟春保就吵了起来。王安国听到了，赶快去把他叫回来，批评道：“你忘记咱们是三好的第八班吗？怎么对老乡那个态度呢？这样可不好，以后要注意呀！”说完他又去给老乡赔不是。他一走，春保就把眼一斜，说起怪话来。王安国知道他刚到解放军里，生活不习惯，回去就把自己的被子抖开，满关心的对春保说：“春保！把我的被子蒙上。”春保见班长对他这样关心，反而对自己刚才说过的怪话有些后悔了。他说：“上级和大家成天说遵守群众纪律，我可太不该啦！以后我干什么也要经过班长的允许，班长说甚不敢干我就不干。”队伍自从到这家老乡家里，每天天不明就出去练兵、上课，家里收拾的整整齐齐，干干净净。院里扫的连根针掉到地下都能看见。心里真觉得有点怪，这队伍真规矩；都是青年人，怎么一天也不乱吵闹，老乡就对王安国班好起来，借什么东西就给。
