Xinhua News Agency, Jin-Ji-Lu-Yu, 12th (Delayed): The great flood has arrived. Fortunately, the dikes along the Yellow River and the Jin Dike in the Hebei-Shandong-Henan area have been completed last month. However, the Chiang side's sabotage is becoming more urgent. After the Chiang army's First Cavalry Brigade destroyed the Jiangsu Dam on the 29th of last month, Liu Ruming's two brigades occupied Linpuji. Chiang planes shuttled and bombed the riverbank day and night. Dangerous sections such as Shilipu, Guozhuang, Sunkou, Yangji, Wanglaojun, and Zhongdui were hit repeatedly, and the situation was very urgent. The military and civilians in the liberated areas are doing their best to rush to block the gaps. The reporter recently interviewed the spokesperson of the Hebei-Shandong-Henan Yellow River Committee and received answers to the following questions:

	Question: Can you tell us in detail the entire process of Chiang's conspiracy to use the Yellow River in recent years?

	Answer: In January of last year, Chiang and the United Nations Relief and Rehabilitation Administration (UNRRA) China Office proposed returning the Yellow River to its old course, with the aim of dividing and shrinking the liberated areas to coordinate with their military offensive. At the same time, they deliberately created an excuse to accuse us of opposing the return to the old course, in order to prepare public opinion for launching a full-scale civil war. The democratic government of the liberated areas, adhering to the policy of peace and construction, proposed restoring the dikes and dredging the river to seek a permanent solution. However, Chiang ignored this and, with the technical and material assistance of UNRRA, unilaterally started the blocking project at Huayuankou in March. In order to save the lives and property of the seven million people along the river, we sent representatives to Kaifeng and proposed "restoring the dikes before blocking the breach." With our legitimate demands and the assistance of just public opinion nationwide, the Kaifeng Agreement was reached in April. In the same month, the Heze Agreement was reached regarding the specific progress of the project. The above-mentioned agreements clearly stipulated that the dikes should be restored and the river dredged first, the course should be straightened, dangerous sections should be repaired, and residents of the riverbed should be relocated before blocking the breach. However, Chiang and UNRRA signed the agreement with one hand, while continuing to throw stones to block the breach at Huayuankou with the other hand. At the same time, they did not pay us the wages and food for the 230,000 people downstream to repair the dikes. It was not until the Nanjing Agreement was reached in May and construction of the dikes began that a part of the payment was given, which was far from the quota, and the dike restoration project was greatly hindered. Huayuankou, on the other hand, accelerated construction without interruption. This period of negotiation shows that Chiang and the U.S. broke agreements as easily as eating a meal. The central goal was to quickly block the breach and control the power of closing and releasing water, so as to release water at any time. Later, because Chiang's army was blocked in northern Jiangsu, the "encirclement and suppression" of eastern Henan failed, and the "encirclement and annihilation" of the Central Plains was also not smooth, the time for attacking the Hebei-Shandong-Henan area was postponed. The closing time of Huayuankou was also postponed accordingly. If not, their conspiracy to flood the liberated areas would have been implemented during the great flood last year. Last year, Chiang's army occupied the liberated areas south of the Yellow River and then intended to block the breach. On one hand, they drove piles and threw stones at Huayuankou, and on the other hand, they shelled our dike repair workers on the north bank. U.S.-made Chiang planes flew low along the river, indiscriminately strafing and bombing to destroy the dike repair project. UNRRA also stood by and did not provide funds and materials for dike restoration. Our representative then negotiated with Chiang and UNRRA in Shanghai and reached another agreement, stipulating that "the date of closing and releasing water shall be decided by the three parties through consultation, depending on the situation of dike restoration and relocation of residents downstream." After signing the agreement, Chiang immediately threw a large number of stone cages and unilaterally blocked Huayuankou on March 15th. One hundred and sixteen villages and fourteen thousand mu of fertile land along the river were flooded. At this point, Chiang Kai-shek believed that the "Yellow River tactic" had been initially completed and "could resist 400,000 troops to prevent the People's Liberation Army from crossing north of the Yellow River." Therefore, on one hand, he mobilized 600,000 troops to launch a "key offensive" against southern Shandong, and on the other hand, he cut off postal and telecommunications links with our representatives stationed in Kaifeng in April. In May, he expelled our representatives stationed in Kaifeng, completely closed the door to Yellow River negotiations, and ordered Cao Fulian's 55th Division to bombard the north bank day and night, while Chiang's planes bombed in shifts, attempting to completely destroy our north bank project. Once the great flood came, they would realize their vicious conspiracy to flood the North China liberated areas.

	Question: What is UNRRA's attitude towards this?

	Answer: UNRRA says nice things but doesn't do them. It never interfered with Chiang's breach of agreements, while repeatedly delaying the wages, food, and materials that should be given to the liberated areas for dike restoration. It is clear that they are Chiang Kai-shek's accomplices and direct implementers of the U.S. imperialist policy of aggression. Believing that they could be rewarded after the Huayuankou closure and water release, they adopted a hands-off attitude towards the liberated areas that were about to become a swamp.

	Question: How did the military and civilians in the liberated areas overcome the many difficulties given by Chiang and UNRRA and avoid this Yellow River disaster?

	Answer: We basically relied on self-rescue, relying on the strength of the people in the liberated areas, and consciously launched a region-wide dike repair campaign under the slogan of protecting fields and lives. First, 30,000 people from southern Hebei rushed from hundreds of miles away to build dikes. Liberated areas such as Taihang, Taiyue, and the Northeast donated funds one after another. Then, 50,000 people were mobilized from counties such as Renping, Boping, and Liaocheng to participate, and the counties along the river poured onto the Yellow River dike like a surging tide. Yanggu originally decided to mobilize 16,000 people, but in reality, 30,000 people automatically went to the dike. Kunwu and Shou Zhang mobilized women to cook for the dike workers, and as a result, 3,000 women went to the dike to compete with the men in dike repair. Starting on May 10th, 300,000 people, risking bombing and strafing by Chiang's army and planes, universally started work. Various counties launched a vigorous campaign to donate stones, food, earthworks, and materials. Kunwu saved 100,000 catties of grain; the three districts of Liaocheng donated 20,000 cubic meters of earth and saved 340,000 catties of rice. At this time, unprecedented records were set by Gao Facheng, Gao Shuxiang, and Xu Fenghe of Liaocheng, who each completed 14 cubic meters of earth per day (generally, each person could build 3-4 cubic meters of earth per day). Long Yuying, the director of the Wen Zhuang Women's Farmers Association in Kunwu, became a hero in pushing earth. Many Chinese and Western doctors voluntarily went to the dike to offer medical treatment and medicine. In the competition, work efficiency was amazing. Puyang and Huaxian completed ten days of work in four days, and Yanggu completed a 20-day plan in 12 days. In terms of repair methods, they created: repair at night when you can't repair during the day; repair in a short time when you can't repair for a long time; repair there when you can't repair here; and the method of placing stones at dangerous sections using feint attacks to deal with the destruction of Chiang's army and planes. Our Changyuan section also used armed blockade against Chiang's army in Changyuan city, and 20,000 people completed 60 li of dike work from Dachacheji to Dasuzhuang in Changyuan within three days, and filled the six deep ditches dug by Chiang's army in an attempt to flood our liberated areas. By July 23rd, the 600-li long dike from Dachacheji to Shuiniu Zhaozhuang in Qihe had been universally raised by two meters, thickened by three meters, and the Jin Dike had been repaired and dangerous sections improved. This glorious achievement is truly an unprecedented historical miracle. We also overcame all difficulties and shattered Chiang's vicious conspiracy with the miracle of such great people's power, allowing Chiang Kai-shek's "400,000 troops" to crawl at the foot of our great dike.

	Question: Later, Chiang's army extensively damaged the south bank dike. What was the reason?

	Answer: Because Chiang's "key offensive" against southern Shandong failed to push the Shandong liberated area north of the Yellow River, and in order to prevent our area's People's Liberation Army from attacking and responding, he intensified the blockade of the riverbank, built fortifications all over the south bank dike, and did not hesitate to flood western Shandong when the great flood came, widening the natural barrier of the Yellow River by hundreds of miles. At this time, our representatives, for the sake of the lives and property of the people in Henan, held talks with Chiang's UNRRA representatives in Heze and Dongming, and suffered their coldness and prevarication. When our representatives returned to the north bank, they were shelled more than a dozen times, almost suffering misfortune. His vicious intentions are clear. However, the vast people on the south bank of the Yellow River did not wait for death. Under the exchange of blood and tears of being killed and arrested, they still seized every opportunity to repair the dikes and deal with emergencies. Chiang's army simply did not allow dike repairs. When the people were rushing to repair the Zhongdui dangerous section, they were harassed by Chiang's army as many as 19 times in 25 days. Fortunately, our Liu Deng army crossed the river at this time. The next day, 100,000 people rose up to repair the dikes. Even with 27 rounds of bombing and strafing by Chiang's planes day and night, they could not stop their enthusiasm for dike repair. Ten thousand people from Yunnan rushed from hundreds of miles away, bringing their own food to the dike. Yuncheng County alone reported donating 6,000 carts of stones. With the high awareness and hard work of the masses, by July 15th, the nearly 300-li-long Lin Huang Dike and Jin Dike from Linpuji to Huanghuasi, including dangerous sections such as Guozhuang and Zhongdui, were completed.

	Question: How much manpower and material resources have we used for dike repair in recent years?

	Answer: According to statistics, we have restored dikes on both the north and south banks (including the Jin Dike) for a total length of 1,800 li in recent years, including dangerous sections, for a total of 25 million man-days, 25 million cubic meters of earth, 150,000 cubic meters of stone, 500,000 bricks, 2.8 million catties of hemp, 200,000 catties of iron wire, 70 million catties of straw, and 5 million willow branches. Our Yellow River Committee advanced three catties of wheat for each cubic meter of earth, and five catties for each miscellaneous worker per day, totaling 100 million catties of wheat. Each cubic meter of stone cost 20 catties of rice, and each brick cost half a catty of rice, totaling 3.25 million catties of rice. Adding transportation, the total cost was 144.525 million catties of rice. This is only the recorded number of man-days, not including the labor and vehicles that participated voluntarily. The projects that were destroyed and rebuilt cannot be calculated.

	Question: Have there been statistics on the losses suffered in recent years?

	Answer: According to incomplete statistics, Chiang's army captured more than 570 of our employees, including Sun Weitan and Cao Lin from Qihe, Kong Fanpeng, the engineering team leader from Pingyin, and Wang Hancai, the section chief from Changyuan. They killed 115 of our section chiefs, including Zhang Xingnong from Changqing and Liu Jie from Puyang. Chiang's planes bombed and shot to death 375 of our employees, including Kang Zhixue and Zhang Yuliang. They injured 910 of our employees, including Liu Baocheng and Li Fanglin. Cross-river shelling injured and killed 380 of our employees, including Li Shiwan and Yang Xinwu, for a total of 2,100 people. As for material losses, there are no complete statistics. Last year alone, when Chiang's army attacked Heze and Dongming, they robbed dike restoration materials worth 500 million yuan in border currency in one instance. Later, Chiang's planes bombed our dangerous sections such as Sunkou, Yangji, and Zhuang 47 times, destroyed 12 dams, destroyed 273 boats, 356 carts, and 780 cattle. The value of these losses has not yet been calculated. The people of the liberated areas will remember this blood debt and present an accusation at the people's court that will try Chiang's bandits in the future. We will also file a complaint with the world's righteous people about UNRRA giving large quantities of supplies to Chiang's side while giving us very little, a discriminatory act.

	Question: Why did UNRRA retreat with Chiang's army this time?

	Answer: UNRRA China Office can no longer wear the mask of the "non-discriminatory policy" that it has always touted on the Yellow River issue and the distribution of materials. This hasty retreat further exposes their tails as accomplices. Because they ignored our suggestions, protests, and agreements over the years, and upon receiving a command from the executioner Chen Cheng, they did not consider the sincerity of the liberated areas and UNRRA in cooperating on dike restoration, nor did they consider the past protection and preferential treatment of UNRRA personnel by the liberated areas. This behavior of helping the wicked and conspiring with Chiang's bandits is extremely shameless! Moreover, shortly after their withdrawal, Chiang's First Cavalry Brigade destroyed the Jiang Dam. They can shrug their shoulders and say, "I don't know" and "I'm not responsible." How ridiculous! After all, they are part of the United Nations organization. We hope that they will wake up as soon as possible and return to the position of the United Nations people. But this awakening is not to come out and defend Chen Cheng with words after he has suffered a major military defeat. It is to jointly stop his crimes with us now, while Chiang's army is shamelessly digging dikes and flooding the people. Otherwise, UNRRA will sever ties with the people of the liberated areas, not our people severing ties with them.

	Question: How do we currently prevent Chiang's bandits from carrying out new destructive conspiracies?

	Answer: Because our north bank dike workers have no UNRRA assistance, the dikes are not as strong as we originally planned. The south bank started later and is mostly new soil. But if there is no destruction by Chiang's army and planes, it can generally be guaranteed to be safe. However, Chiang Kai-shek's intention to flood the liberated areas is certain. This was confirmed when he proposed returning the Yellow River to its old course the day before he launched the civil war. Therefore, after the People's Liberation Army in our area annihilated his four divisions, he wanted to play new tricks again. The destruction of the Jiangsu Dam last month was his prelude. Later, with two brigades, he occupied Linji and controlled the Liuzhuang and Gaocun dangerous sections upstream in Dongming, preparing to breach the dikes and release water at any time. Fortunately, the water level has dropped in the past few days and has not caused any harm. Therefore, the people south of the Yellow River have two ways to save themselves: one is to intensify flood prevention and dike protection, and repair the destruction of Chiang's army and planes at any time; the other is to arm themselves and cooperate with the People's Liberation Army to fight a decisive battle with Chiang's bandits and quickly and completely eliminate the invading army. At present, in order to save themselves, the people along the river are protecting the dikes and dangerous sections that they have just built with their blood and sweat with a hundred times more vigilance.

    揭发蒋美玩弄黄河阴谋经过号召沿河人民加紧护堤自救
    【新华社晋冀鲁豫十二日电】（迟到）大泛已至，幸冀鲁豫区黄河两岸临黄堤及金堤已于上月完成。但蒋方破坏愈急，上月二十九日蒋军骑一旅破坏江苏坝后，复以刘汝明两旅之众占我临濮集，蒋机并在沿河堤岸穿梭狂炸，昼夜不绝。十里铺、国庄、孙口、杨集、王老君、仲＠堆等处险工，中弹累累，情势十分紧急，解放区军民正尽力抢堵中。记者日前特走访冀鲁豫区黄委会发言人，承答复所询各项问题如下：
    问：蒋贼年来利用黄河之阴谋，全部经过可否详告？
    答：去年一月蒋贼与联总中国分署提出黄河归故，目的在于分割与紧缩解放区，以配合其军事进攻。同时，亦在故意制造借口，欲加我以反对归故的罪名，以为掀起全国内战的舆论准备。解放区民主政府本和平建设的方针，提出复堤浚河，以求一劳永逸。奈蒋贼竟置不理，在联总之技术与物资帮助下，三月间，即在花园口片面开始堵口工程。我为挽救沿河七百万人民生命财产，乃派代表到开封，提出“先复堤而后堵口”。在我正当要求及全国正义舆论协助下，四月双方成立开封协议；同月，关于具体工程的进行，又成立菏泽协议。上述历次协议，均明确规定先行复堤浚河、裁取直、整理险工、迁移河床居民，然后再行堵口。但蒋贼与联总一手在协定上签字，一手仍在花园口继续抛石堵口，同时不付给我下游二十三万人修堤之工粮工款，直至五月南京协议成立，动工修堤，始付给一部，距定额相差甚远，复堤工程大受障阻。而花园口则加紧施工，从未一日间断。此一段之交涉，可以看出蒋美签约毁约，实如家常便饭，中心目的在于迅速堵口，掌握闭放大权，以便随时合龙放水。后因蒋军在苏北受阻，“清剿”豫东失败，“围歼”中原亦不顺利之后，推迟了进攻冀鲁豫区的时间。花园口合龙时间，亦由是推迟。待刘峙运兵部署陇海线的兵力，又不能不保持新汴路几天，因而大泛到来，堵口合龙未成。不然，其水淹解放区之阴谋，早在去年大泛时即已施行了。去年蒋军侵占我黄河以南解放区，乃又意图堵口，一面在花园口打桩抛石，一面炮击我北岸修堤员工，美制蒋机沿河低飞滥施扫射轰炸，以破坏修堤工程。而联总亦袖手旁观，不给复堤款料。我代表乃又在上海与蒋贼及联总谈判，并又成立协议，规定“合龙放水日期，须视下游复堤及迁移居民情况，由三方会商决定。”蒋于签字之后，立即以铁丝笼石大量抛投，擅于三月十五日堵死花园口。沿河一百一十六个村庄，一万四千亩良田，悉遭淹没。至此，蒋介石自以为“黄河战术”初步完成，“可抵四十万大军阻止人民解放军于黄河以北”。于是，一面调六十万大军放手向鲁南作“重点进攻”，一面于四月间断绝我驻开封代表的邮电联系。五月又驱逐我驻汴代表，完全关闭黄河谈判之门，并令曹福林之五十五师日夜向北岸炮轰，蒋机轮番轰炸，企图彻底摧毁我北岸工程；待大泛一来，即实现其水淹华北解放区之恶毒阴谋。
    问：联总对此态度如何呢？
    答：联总是说人话不办人事的。对蒋贼的破坏协议，从来不加干涉；而对应给解放区复堤之工粮工款及物资，则一再拖延。分明他们是蒋介石的帮凶，也是美帝国主义侵略政策的直接执行者。以为花园口合龙放水之后，可以成功受赏，对解放区行将变成泽国，故作壁上观的态度。
    问：解放区军民如何克服蒋贼与联总所给的重重困难，避免了这一黄祸呢？
    答：我们基本上是自救，依靠解放区人民的力量，在保田保身的口号下，自觉的掀起全区修堤热潮。首先冀南三万民众自数百里外赶来筑堤，太行、太岳、东北各解放区纷纷助款，继之荏平、博平、聊城各县动员五万人前来参加，而沿河各县更风起云涌的涌下黄堤。阳谷本来决定动员一万六千人，实际自动下堤者达三万人。昆吾、寿张动员妇女与堤工做饭，结果三千妇女下堤，与男子比赛修堤。自五月十日开始，三十万人冒蒋军蒋机轰炸与扫射，普遍开工，各县并掀起轰轰烈烈的献石、献粮、献土方、献料运动。昆吾节省粮十万斤；聊城三区献土两万方，省米三十四万斤。在这时出现了聊城高法成、高树祥、许凤和，每人一日完成十四方土（一般每人每日可筑土三至四方）的空前纪录；出现了昆吾文庄女农会主任龙御英成为推土打英雄；出现很多中西医生自动到堤上献医献药。在竞赛中，工作效率惊人，濮阳、滑县四天完成十天的工程，阳谷二十天的计划，十二天即告完成。在修法上，他们创造了：白天不能修，晚上修；长时间不能修，短时间修；这里不能修，那里修；与声东击西的险工下石办法，以对付蒋军蒋机之破坏。我长垣段并以武装封锁长垣城蒋军，两万人于三天之内，完成长垣大车集至大苏庄六十里的堤工，并填平蒋军所掘企图淹我解放区的六道大深沟。至七月二十三日为止，从长大车集至齐河的水牛赵庄长达六百里的长堤普遍加高二公尺，加厚三公尺，并修整金堤，整理险工。这一辉煌的成就，实为空前的历史奇迹。我们也就在这样伟大的人民力量的奇迹里，克服万难，粉碎蒋贼的毒辣阴谋，使蒋介石的“四十万大军”匍伏在我们大堤的脚下。
    问：后来，蒋军对南岸大堤大肆破坏，原因何在？
    答：蒋贼因对鲁南的“重点进攻”不能把山东解放区压到黄河以北去，并为阻止我区解放军出击策应。便更加紧封锁河岸，在河南岸大堤上遍修工事，不惜大泛到来即水淹鲁西，把黄河的天险再加宽他几百里。这时，我代表为了河南人民的生命财产，曾与蒋方联总会谈于菏泽，又谈于东明，备受其冷淡与推诿之苦。且于我代表回北岸时，遭其炮击十余发，几遭不测。其用心的狠毒，已可概见。但我黄河南岸广大人民并不坐待死亡，他们在被杀被抓的血泪交流下，仍抓紧一切时机，进行修堤抢险；而蒋军则根本不让修堤。在人民抢修仲＠堆险工时，二十五天中竟被蒋军袭扰十九次之多。我刘邓大军适于此时过河，次日即有十万人奋起修堤，虽有蒋机日夜二十七次的轮番轰炸扫射，亦不能阻止他们的修堤热情。郓南万人从百里之外赶来，自带食粮上堤，只郓城一县，献石即自报六千大车。在群众的高度自觉与奋力下，至七月十五日，自临濮集至黄花寺近三百里的临黄堤及金堤，包括国庄、仲＠堆等险工，均告完竣。
    问：年来我方修堤共用人力物力究有多少？
    答：统计年来我复堤南北两岸（连金堤在内）共长一千八百里，包括险工共人工二千五百万个，土二千五百万方，石十五万方，砖五十万方，麻二百八十万斤，铁丝二十万斤，秸料七千万斤，柳枝五百万斤，每方土由我黄委会垫麦子三斤，杂工每日则垫五斤，共合工粮一万万斤麦。每方石米二十斤，砖每个米半斤，共用三百二十五万斤米，加运输共用米一万万四千五百二十五万斤。秸料购买用边币三十八万万九千二百万元。这只是有计载的工数，不包括自动参加的人工车马。而中经破坏又重修的工程，则无从计算。
    问：年来所遭损失，有无统计？
    答：我方复堤所受损害，据不完全统计，蒋军捕我员工有齐河孙维坦、曹林、平阴工程队长孔繁鹏，长垣段长王汉才等五百七十余人，杀我长清段长张兴农、濮县段长刘杰等一百一十五人，蒋机炸射死我员工康志学、张玉良等三百七十五人，伤我员工刘保成、李方林等九百一十人，隔岸炮击伤亡我员工李世万、杨心五等三百八十人，共计两千一百人。至于物资损失，无全部统计。仅去年蒋军进攻菏泽、东明，一次即被劫去复堤工料值边币五万万元。及后蒋机炸中我孙口、杨、庄等险工四十七次，炸毁坝十二次，炸毁船二百七十三只，大车三百五十六辆，牛七百八十头，其价值尚无统计。解放区人民将牢记这笔血债，在将来人民审判蒋贼们的法庭上，堤出控诉。而联总的将大批物资尽给蒋方，给我们极少极少，此种歧视行为，我们也要向世界正义人士提出控诉。
    问：这次联总为什么随蒋军撤退呢？
    答：联总中国分署在黄河问题及物资分配上，再也戴不住素来所标榜的“不歧视政策”的假面具；此次仓惶南退，更暴露他们帮凶者的尾巴。因为年来我们的建议、抗议与协议，他们就置之不理，而接到刽子手陈诚的一纸命令，即丝毫不考虑解放区与联总的复堤合作诚意，亦毫不考虑过去解放区对联总人员之保护与优待。这种助纣为虐与蒋贼合谋的行为，何其无耻！而且，在其撤退不久，即有蒋骑一旅的破坏江坝。背一背脸就可以说：“不知道”，“不负责”，又何等出丑！然而毕竟他们是联合国组织的一部分，希望仍及早醒悟，回到联合国人民的立场。但这醒悟不是等陈诚在军事上大大溃败，而出来代他用言语挡护一阵。而是在蒋军无赖正在扒堤水淹人民的现在，和我们共同制止他的罪行。否则，那就是联总自绝于解放区人民，非是我们人民绝他。
    问：目前我方如何防止蒋贼新的破坏阴谋？
    答：我北岸堤工因为无联总援助，修得不如我们原计划的坚固。南岸下手较晚，又多是新土。但若无蒋军蒋机破坏，亦大致可保无虞。然蒋介石水淹解放区是肯定的，这在他打内战的前一天提出黄河归故的时候，就已经肯定了。所以这次我区人民解放军消灭其四个师之后，就又想耍新花样。上月破坏江苏坝是其先声，后以二旅之众，占我临集，并控制上游刘庄及东明高村两险工，准备随时决堤放水。幸这几天水落，尚未成害。因而我们黄河南人民有两种办法足以自救：一是加紧防泛护堤，随时修复蒋军蒋机之破坏；一是武装配合人民解放军蒋贼作殊死战，迅速干脆全部消灭进犯军。现沿河人民为了自救，正以百倍警惕，保护自己刚刚用血汗修起的大堤与险工。
