    Bianqu (Border Region) Finance Office Health Material Factory:
    Production Increases with Technical Improvements
    [This newspaper reports] The Bianqu (Border Region) Military-Government Joint Finance Office Health Material Factory launched a meritorious service campaign in March, and by the end of June, production standards had increased three to four times. A preliminary summary of the "July 7th" period: a total production of 17,238 pounds of pills, tablets, and powders, 5,751 boxes, 3,378 bars of soap, and 18,818 boxes and 3 ampules of injectable medicine. There have been many achievements in technical engineering innovations and improvements in working methods and approaches. What is especially valuable is that workers from peasant backgrounds, after acquiring basic knowledge of physics and chemistry, are able to apply theory to practice, utilize their wisdom, and make many creations and inventions in their work. For example, when the hydrometers for testing the specific gravity of alcohol and hydrochloric acid broke, worker Tang Xueliang manufactured his own according to the principles, and now it has been completely successful, and there is no need to purchase them from outside. Beside the distillation water tower, worker Yang Hongzhen erected a fifteen-foot-high pulley, allowing water to automatically pour into the buckets. Yang Hongzhen and Guo Qirong modified the alcohol distiller, increasing the alcohol content from over 80 percent to over 90 percent, with the highest concentration reaching 97 percent. After democratic evaluation and debate, Zhang Chongwang, Li Shuanghe, and Shi Wenrui were selected as special-class meritorious heroes. Zhang Chongwang's group used scientific division of labor, making each person an indispensable link in the work, and established a mass-based, bottom-up leadership style, resulting in rapid progress in work. Li Shuanghe's group, with the spirit of unity, hard work, and no requests for leave or absenteeism, received a banner with the inscription "Unity and Progress."

    边区财办卫生材料厂
    生产提高技术改进
    【本报讯】边区军政联合财经办事处卫生材料厂三月份即开展了立功运动，至六月底生产标准数提高了三——四倍。七七初步总结：共生产丸片粉剂一七二三八磅，五七五一盒，肥皂三三七八块，注射药一八八一八盒三支。技术工程上的创造，及工作方式方法上的改进都有不少成绩，尤其宝贵的是农民出身的工人，才获得了初步的理化常识后，能将理论应用到实际中去，发挥他们的智慧，在工作中有许多创造与发明，如测验酒精盐酸等的比重计坏了，工人唐学良就按照原理自己制造，现在已完全成功，再不用向外购买了。在蒸溜的水塔旁，工人杨洪珍架设了丈五高的滑车，使水自动倒入水桶内。杨洪珍、郭启荣改装了酒精蒸溜器，使含量由百分之八十几增至百分之九十以上，最浓的曾达到百分之九十七。经民主评定与争论，选出张崇旺、李双合、石文瑞三名，为特等立功英雄。张崇旺组以科学分工，使每个人都成为工作中必不可少的一环，建立了群众性的从下而上的领导作风，使工作突飞猛进。李双合组以团结一体积极苦干的精神普遍经常；无请假无旷工等事实，获得了“团结进步”的锦旗一面。
