Xinhua News Agency, Shandong, 15th: According to Qingdao newspapers, at a time when the Kuomintang-controlled areas are facing severe grain shortages, Chiang Kai-shek's "Executive Headquarters" (行总) in Shanghai is actually hoarding relief grain from UNRRA for profit, resulting in the grain becoming severely moldy and rotten. On the 9th of this month, Chiang's Executive Headquarters handed over the rotten relief grain to the purchasing department of Chiang's Central Trust Bureau for open bidding, including over 9,000 pounds of flour and over 50,000 *jin* (approximately 66,000 lbs) of rice. When the bidding grain merchants discovered that the grain was completely rotten, they all turned away holding their noses, and the citizens were exceptionally indignant.

　　行总标卖霉粮市民愤慨异常
    【新华社山东十五日电】据青岛报载，蒋区粮荒严重之际，上海蒋家行总竟将联总之救济粮食囤积谋利，致该项粮食大批发霉腐烂。本月九日蒋记行总将腐烂救济粮交蒋记中央信托局购料处公开标售者，即有面粉九千余磅、白米五万多市斤。当投标粮商发觉该粮已全部腐烂时，皆掩鼻而过，市民莫不愤慨异常。
