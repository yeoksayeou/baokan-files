　　Taihang Second District Indigo Seedlings Mature
  　Agriculture and Forestry Bureau Goes to the Countryside to Guide Indigo Extraction
    [Our newspaper Taihang News] The area planted with indigo in the Second District has now surged to 4,150 mu, exceeding the original plan of 3,000 mu by 38%. Xiangyuan and Wuxiang have the most (2,644 mu), Pingding has 620 mu, and Heshun, Xiyang, and Zuoquan were initially concerned that "planting indigo is easy, but extracting indigo is difficult" due to the colder climate. However, with the government's help in solving technical problems of indigo extraction, the masses were enthusiastic and actively tried planting. These three counties together planted 696.91 mu. The border counties of Yuci, Taiyuan, Qi County, and Shouyang planted 130 mu. Most of the seedlings have now matured, with indigo seedlings over two chi tall. This year, they have not been affected by pests, and the seedlings are strong, the leaves are fat, and the blue color is full. The masses are extremely happy. In the past half-month, the entire district has been actively preparing for indigo extraction and has been busy transferring skilled indigo extractors from Wuxiang to Yushe and Zuoquan. Heshun and Xiyang held small technical research meetings on indigo extraction, and the results of the practice were very good. The indigo extraction practice at the Second District Agriculture and Forestry Bureau Farm was successful, and staff from the organs went to Songshuping, Zhangba, ShiliDian, Qilidian, Hamatan, Tongyu, Matian, and Xiajiao in Zuoquan to guide indigo extraction in conjunction with experienced old farmers. Cheng Song from Pingding, Cui Wanliang from Jianzhang in Wuxiang, model cooperative director Cheng Panghai, Bao Fushang from Xiabeizhang, Wei Lianbao from Heshun, and Xiyang District Chief Wei Haozhen are all actively taking the lead in planting and preparing for indigo extraction. Based on an average yield of 100 jin of indigo per mu, the entire district can produce 400,000 jin. Each jin of indigo can dye 80 chi of cloth, and with the market price of 150 yuan for the dye cost per chi of cloth, the dye cost income for the entire district will increase by 480,000,000 yuan.
