    Xinhua News Agency, Northwest, 2nd. The military and civilians of the Guanzhong Sub-district of Shaanxi-Gansu-Ningxia fought valiantly for three weeks, crushing Chiang's army's second "Encirclement and Suppression." On July 2nd, Hu Zongnan scraped together eleven and a half brigades, following the Japanese invaders' vicious policy of village consolidation and clearing, and launched another "Encirclement and Suppression" against the small area of less than 600 square li in Guanzhong. The military and civilians of the sub-district, on the one hand, protected the safe transfer of the old, weak, women, and children, and organized young and middle-aged people to harvest the new wheat; on the other hand, they laid minefields everywhere and persisted in fighting in place. On the 23rd, a part of the local corps of the People's Liberation Army bypassed the main force of the enemy and attacked Longgao Town, southeast of @ County, killing and wounding 15 Chiang's Police Corps members, including the squadron leader and below, and capturing 110 alive. Another unit advanced to Mount Cuo'e, 30 li northwest of Sanyuan, on the 10th, killing, wounding, and capturing more than 40 enemy soldiers of the Provisional Second Brigade. Chiang's army main force did not dare to disperse, and the large troops advanced densely, not only finding nothing everywhere and having difficulty with food and lodging, but also suffering from mine scares. Near Tuqiao Town in @yi County, four people were killed and more than ten were wounded by landmines in one day. By July 23rd, Hu Zongnan, with nothing to gain and in a state of utter disarray, had no choice but to follow the old path of the first failed "Encirclement and Suppression" and drag his exhausted and battered troops back to their original defenses.

    关中我军奋战三周粉碎敌二次“清剿”
    【新华社西北二日电】陕甘宁关中分区军民奋战三周，粉碎蒋军第二次“清剿”，胡宗南于七月二日东拼西凑集中十一个半旅的兵力，秉承日寇并村清乡毒计，向关中不及六百平方华里之狭小地区再次进行“清剿”。分区军民一面掩护老弱妇孺安全转移，组织青壮年抢收新麦，同时遍布地雷阵，坚持原地斗争。二十三日解放军地方兵团一部绕过敌主力，出击＠县东南之龙高镇，毙伤蒋记保警队中队长以下十五人，生俘一百一十名。另部于十日挺进至三原西北三十里之嵯峨山，毙伤俘敌暂二旅四十余人。蒋军主力不敢分散，大部队密集前进，不仅处处扑空，食宿两难，且饱受地雷惊吓。在＠邑土桥镇附近一日之内，即被地雷炸死四人，炸伤十余人。至七月二十三日胡宗南以一无所获狼狈不堪，只得顺着首次“清剿”失败的老路，把疲惫和受创的部队拖回原防。
