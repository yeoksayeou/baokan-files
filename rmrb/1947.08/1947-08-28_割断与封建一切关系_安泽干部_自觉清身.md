　　Severing All Ties with Feudalism
  　Anze Cadres "Consciously Cleanse Themselves"
    [Report from our Taiyue correspondent on the 26th] During the "digging out anti-air raid shelters" movement in Anze, the Eighth District created a cadre "self-cleansing conscious movement," in which everyone made a deep self-examination of their relationship with feudal forces. Wang Jinchi said, "My family is an old rich peasant family with a feudal tail, which I haven't severed for several years. This time, I am determined to admit my mistakes to the masses, cut off the tail, and lead the masses to completely liberate themselves." Zhang Huafeng said, "In addition to keeping four mu of bad land, I will return the remaining five cattle and all my property to the masses, cutting off the feudalism on myself completely." Hou Guozhu reflected, "My wife has a feudal rich peasant background, and she brought 20 mu of land, 10 shi of grain, and some farm tools into my family when we got married. I want to return them all to the masses." Retired soldier Zhai Xingde said, "I am related to a certain landlord through marriage. I will resolutely break off the relationship when I go back." After everyone's self-examination, it inspired Lu Shuangze, a member of the Farmers' Association Standing Committee, to report: "I have been keeping 13 shi of grain, two manor houses, and some farm tools for the landlord. I am willing to thoroughly admit my mistakes to the masses and hand them all over to the masses." After this "self-cleansing conscious movement," everyone said with ease and joy: "We must first cleanse ourselves before we can lead the masses to eliminate feudalism."

　　割断与封建一切关系
  　安泽干部“自觉清身”
    【本报太岳二十六日电】安泽在刨“防空洞”运动中，八区创造了干部“清身自觉运动”，每个人都把自己与封建势力的关系作了深刻的检讨。王金池说：“我家是个有封建尾巴的旧富农，几年来并未割过，这次决心向群众承认错误，将尾巴割掉，领导群众翻透身。”张华凤说：“我除留四亩坏地外，其余五头牛及全部家产都拿出来还给群众，将自己身上的封建割得一干二净。”侯国柱反省道：“我女人是个封建富农成份，结婚时带进我家土地二十亩，粮食十石及一部农具，我要全部还给群众。”退伍军人翟兴德说：“我和某地主是干亲家，回去坚决断绝关系。”经大家检讨后，激起了农会常委路双则自报说：“我给地主保存着十三石谷子，两座庄子，还有几件农具，愿向群众彻底认错，全部交给群众。”经此次“清身自觉运动”后，每个人都轻松愉快的说：“先将自己身上洗干净，才能领导群众消灭封建。”
