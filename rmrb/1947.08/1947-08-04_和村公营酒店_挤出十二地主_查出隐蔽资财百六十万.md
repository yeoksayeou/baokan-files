He Village Public Hotel Squeezes Out Twelve Landlords
Investigation Uncovers Hidden Assets of 1.6 Million

[Report from this newspaper] Since the land reform, many landlords and feudal rich peasants have infiltrated public industrial and commercial organizations to evade struggle, conceal assets, and even engage in sabotage. The staff at the He Village Public Hotel in Wu'an were quite diverse. After the "squeezing out feudalism" campaign penetrated the public stores, the hotel's cadres and staff first aligned their thinking, responded to the county committee's call, and adopted the principle of "rather have fewer than allow the corrupt," thoroughly eliminating feudalism. Landlords were purged and handed over to the masses for handling, and the landlords' "air raid shelters" in the hotel were also unearthed. The discovered property was given to the masses. In total, twelve landlords of various sizes were squeezed out, and through the combined efforts of the masses, the landlords' property and grain were accounted for: over 3,500 catties of millet, over 1,700 catties of wheat, over 300 catties of corn and grain, 98 catties of seed oil, 40 catties of salt, over 20 catties of homespun cloth, 17 catties of cotton, three buckets of fermented green feed, 32,000 yuan, 98 pieces of silk and coarse cloth padded single clothes and bedding, 9 zhang of silk satin, three mules, and other items totaling over 1.6 million yuan.

[Report from this newspaper] Zhang Zhide, the accountant of the Lower North Street Poor People's Cooperative in Changzhi, was a feudal usurer who joined the cooperative last April. He appeared to be very active in his work, deceiving the cadres. When the masses raised the issue of his feudal exploitation during the "cutting off the tail" campaign, a cadre even explained on his behalf, saying: This is a matter of his ancestors, and the matter was handled superficially. In reality, the masses did not fully vent their anger. Zhang felt that he had a cadre to support him, so he constantly counterattacked the masses: For example, when farmer Tao Shuzhang took corn to the cooperative and exchanged it for six catties of flour (as stipulated), Zhang came back from an outing, and upon seeing that the corn was not good, he glared and said: "This corn wouldn't even make a chicken lay eggs, why did you exchange it for six catties?" He immediately forced them to bring Tao back and take back one catty of flour. During the war effort to transport grain, when the masses went to the cooperative to borrow travel expenses, he refused to lend them money despite having it after repeated negotiations. When the masses wanted to buy some flour from the cooperative to make dry rations, he refused to sell it to them. The masses reflected that "the cooperative is controlled by a landlord." After deliberation by the masses, he was removed from his post, and the masses are now preparing for a second reckoning with Zhang.

[Another report] In order to respond to the call to squeeze out feudalism, the Changzhi Yimin Water Company held a full staff meeting on the 15th of this month. The specific approach was: After everyone first read the materials in the Party newspaper, they had a correct understanding ideologically. Under the slogan of "Maintaining the purity of the working class proletariat, resolutely breaking with feudal forces," they successively investigated and found seven people, including Cui Lianze, a salesman at the feudal landlord's flour mill, and their acts of sabotage. It was decided to expel them from the factory and hand them back to their villages for handling. After this squeezing out of feudalism, the work was not affected in the slightest. The workers put forward the slogan of "one person doing the work of two," and worker Li Tongxiang, in addition to watching the machines, also had to sell water in the afternoon. The stoker, in addition to cooking, also had to sell water, demonstrating everyone's initiative and enthusiasm. (Changzhi City Guidance Newspaper)

    和村公营酒店  挤出十二地主
    查出隐蔽资财百六十万
    【本报讯】土地改革以来，不少地主、封建富农混入公营工商机关，逃避斗争，掩藏资财，甚至活动破坏。武安和村公营酒店，人员相当复杂。“挤封建”运动，深入到公营商店后，酒店干部职工，首先打通思想，响应了县委号召，采取了“宁缺勿滥”，彻底消灭封建的方针，把地主都清洗出去，交群众处理；把地主在酒店的“防空洞”也发掘出来，财物交给群众。共计查挤出大小地主十二名，与群众结合双方搞出地主财物粮食计小米三千五百余斤，小麦一千七百余斤，玉茭、谷子三百余斤，籽油九十八斤，盐四十斤，土布二十余斤，棉花十七斤，煮青三桶，款洋三万二千元，丝绸与粗布棉夹单衣服被褥等九十八件，绸缎九丈，骡子三头，及其他物品总值洋一百六十余万元。（智让）
    【本报讯】长治下北街贫民合作社会计张芝德，是个封建高利贷者，去年四月到了合作社。工作中表现假积极，迷惑了干部，在割尾巴时，群众提出他的封建剥削问题时，某干部还给他解释说：这是他祖上的事，很浮浅的处理了事，实际上群众并没出透气。张感到有干部作主，便不断的向群众进行反攻：如农民陶树长拿玉茭到合作社去换了六斤粉（规定就是这数），张外出回来，一见玉茭有点不好，就吹胡瞪眼的说：“这玉茭喂鸡都不下蛋，为啥给他换六斤呢？”立逼着去把陶赶回来退下一斤粉了事。参战运粮时，群众到合作社借路费，三番五次商量，他有钱不借给。群众想从合作社买点面做干粮他不卖给，群众反映是“合作社地主掌握了”。经群众酝酿罢免了他的职务，现群众正准备对张二次进行清算。
    【又讯】长治益民自来水公司为了响应挤封建号召，于本月十五日全体职工开挤封建会。具体做法是：大家先将党报上的材料阅读后，思想上有了正确认识，全体职工在“保持工人无产阶级的纯洁，坚决与封建势力分家”的口号下，先后查出封建地主面粉厂营业员崔连则等七人及其破坏事实，决开除出厂，交回本村处理。经此次挤封建之后，工作上未受丝毫影响，工友们提出“一人顶二人用”的口号，工人李桐祥同志，除了看机器外，下午还要卖水，火夫同志除做饭外，也要代卖水，表现出每个人的自动性积极性。（长市导报）
