　　Experience of Jiao Wubao's Mutual Aid Movement

　　[Taiyue, this newspaper, 25th] The Taiyue People's Liberation Army has initially summarized the experience of Jiao Wubao's mutual aid movement: First, the combination of ideological mutual aid and action mutual aid. For example, in combat, mutually help dig fortifications, fight the enemy, and in marching, mutually help carry guns and things, etc. In practical mutual assistance, it is necessary to add explanation and education, and through this practical action, enlighten his class consciousness, make him realize the tradition of class love in the revolutionary troops, and encourage his ambition and enthusiasm. Otherwise, it will be blind mutual aid, and even some new soldiers will recognize that you have the obligation to carry guns for him, and he has the right to enjoy, which will increase his dependence and make him unable to struggle hard. Therefore, it is necessary to oppose the "only work, no talk, mule-like bad style." Second, "train" new soldiers in combat, not "preserve" them. At present, there are two methods for mutual aid groups to lead new soldiers: First, "preserve" the new soldiers. In the fortifications, send the new soldiers a little further back. On the surface, it seems to be particularly caring and loving for the soldiers, but in reality, it allows the new soldiers to be beaten to death and unable to fight back. This will make them more timid. Some also let the new soldiers open the grenade cap and throw it. Although this is better, it is still not active enough. The latter method of Jiao Wubao leading new soldiers to fight the enemy is to "train" them in combat. For example, in the Quwo battle, he constantly explained and encouraged the new soldiers, and led them to repel the enemy's counterattack three times. The new soldiers saw that the enemy was afraid of the grenades they threw, so they became more courageous and fought more bravely. Third, explain the situation, support courage and think of ways. General situations are easy to explain, such as saying, "The bullets are flying high, don't be afraid," "As long as you hide well, the shells can't blow you up," etc. But when encountering false situations, sometimes it cannot be exposed. For example, when attacking Quwo this time, the enemy shouted at night, "A large number of planes will come at twelve o'clock tomorrow to bomb Dongguan." The next day, some new soldiers asked, "Is it twelve o'clock yet?" In fact, there was no such thing. In contrast, Jiao Wubao did a good job of exposing the false situation in the Quwo battle. When they were still three or four hundred meters away from the enemy, the enemy started shooting and shouting wildly, "Charge! Charge! Capture them alive!" This scared some new soldiers and made them panic. Jiao Wubao asked, "Do you know what they are bluffing?" The new soldier said, "I don't know." Jiao Wubao said, "This enemy is easy to fight. We are so far away from him, and he is so scared that he can't hold back and is shooting and bluffing wildly. If the enemy is 'stubborn', he will wait until we get closer before shooting." Sure enough, as soon as we charged, we defeated the enemy. This is not enough, but also constantly think of ways to support courage in combat according to the specific situation. It is not enough to just say, "So many people are not afraid, only you are afraid of death." Fourth, promote expertise. The mutual aid group is not about the group leader teaching the group members, but about promoting the specialties of the new soldiers, veteran soldiers, and liberated soldiers, and implementing them into various work in peacetime and wartime, teaching each other and learning from each other. For example, the plan of the Second Class of the 4072nd Company was always: persuade a few prisoners, and capture a few guns. As for how to capture them, they said very little. However, the liberated soldier Cheng Wenwu, because he knew the enemy's roots, said, "I know the characteristics of the Central Army's fighting. We must fight them with firepower, they are not afraid, they are most afraid of bayonets and grenades. As long as we hold our breath and wait for the enemy to get close, a row of grenades will be thrown out, and they will turn their butts and run away. If we carry bayonets, then we must capture them. We have one class, and we can capture a company of them." Later, in the Liuhuangling battle, two classes really defeated two companies of them.

　　焦五保互助运动经验
    【本报太岳二十五日电】太岳人民解放军初步总结出焦五保互助运动经验：首为思想互助与行动互助结合。比如作战中互助挖工事、打敌人，行军中互助背枪、背东西等，实际互助中就必须加上解释和教育，通过这种实际行动启发他的阶级觉悟，使他认识到革命部队中阶级友爱的传统，鼓励他的上进心与积极性，不然便是盲目互助，甚至有些新战士会认识你就有替他背枪的义务，他就有享受的权利，反而增加他的依赖性，不能艰苦奋斗。因此要反对“光出力，不哼声，毛驴主义坏作风”。二、在战斗中把新战士“锻炼”出来，不是“保存”起来。目前互助组带领新战士有两种方法：一、是把新战士“保存”起来。在工事里把新战士送的靠后一点，表面看好像对战士格外关心爱护，但实际上是让新战士死挨打，不能打人。这样会越打越胆怯。也有的让新战士揭手榴弹盖，他投。这样虽然较好一些，但仍不够积极。后一种焦五保的带领新战士打敌人，在战斗中“锻炼出来”的方法。如在曲沃战斗中他不断向新战士解释鼓励，带领他们三次打退了敌人反扑，新战士看见敌人怕自己投入的手榴弹，就更壮了胆，越打越胆壮。三、说明情况解圪，撑腰壮胆想办法。一般情况容易解释，如说：“子弹打的高哩，不要怕”，“只要掩藏好，炮弹炸不住人”等。但遇到假情况，有时便不能揭穿。如这次打曲沃时，夜间敌人喊话说：“明天十二点钟要来大批飞机炸平东关”。第二天有些新战士就问：“到不到十二点钟？”实际上就没这会事。与这相反，焦五保在曲沃战斗中，对假情况揭穿的好。当他们离敌人还有三、四百米达时，敌人就乱打乱喊：“冲锋！冲锋！捉活的！”吓的新战士有些心慌意乱。焦五保就问：“你知道是诈虎甚哩？”新战士说：“不知道。”焦五保就说：“这敌人好打。咱离他这么远，他就吓的沉不住气了，乱打乱诈虎。要是敌人‘顽强’，他非等咱接近了才打枪。”果真我一冲锋便把敌人冲垮了。只此还不够，还要在战斗中根据具体情况，不断想办法，撑腰壮胆。光说：“这么多人不害怕，只你一个人怕死。”是不行的。四、发扬一技之长。互助组不是组长教组员，而是把新战士，老战士、解放战士的特长都发扬出来，贯彻到平时战时各种工作中，互相教，互相学。如四○七二连二班计划时都是：说服几个俘虏，缴几支枪。至于怎样缴法、捉法，都说的很少。但解放战士程文武，由于他了解敌人根底，便说：“中央军打仗的特点我清楚。咱要和他拚火力，他可不怕，他最怕刺刀手榴弹。只要咱沉住气，等敌人接近了，一排子手榴弹打出去，他会扭屁股就跑。咱端上刺刀，那就非捉他俘虏不行。咱有一个班，就能捉他一个连。”后来在刘黄岭战斗中，真是两个班垮了他两个连。
