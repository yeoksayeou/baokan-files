Xinhua News Agency, Jin-Cha-Ji, 15th: The local armed forces of Jin-Cha-Ji are active in the Pingjin-Baoding triangle area and around Baoding, Shijiazhuang, and Taiyuan, restraining more than 30,000 regular troops and local forces of Chiang, Fu, and Yan. They inflicted significant casualties on the so-called "group advance" of Chiang and Fu's troops into the heart of central Hebei last month, forcing them to flee back to Baoding in panic. From late June to the beginning of this month, local corps fought 135 battles in the aforementioned areas, killing, wounding, and capturing over 2,200 Chiang, Fu, and Yan soldiers, seizing a large amount of supplies, and destroying over 50 enemy碉堡 [diāobǎo - blockhouses]. In the Pingjin-Baoding triangle area, our powerful guerrilla corps, with the force of an autumn wind sweeping away fallen leaves, completely eliminated all 23 blockhouses of the puppet Wang Fenggang's forces on the west bank of the Daqing River northeast of Xincheng on July 29th. The Tianyang Guerrilla Corps, advancing on both sides of the Ping-Sui Railway, captured Jiajiatun, an important stronghold on the Tian (zhen) - Yang (yuan) highway, completely controlled the highway, and then dispatched a detachment north across the Ping-Sui Railway to completely recover the vast area north of the Ping-Sui Railway belonging to Tianzhen County, echoing the Ji-Cha-Re People's Liberation Army operating in northern Chahar. Chiang and Fu's troops, wandering in central Hebei, were repeatedly ambushed by our local forces. From July 21st to 28th, the militia killed and wounded over 800 of them with cold guns, landmines, and ambushes.

    【新华社晋察冀十五日电】晋察冀各地方武装部队活跃于平津保三角地区及保定、石庄、太原周围，牵制蒋傅阎正规军及地方团队达三万余名，并予蒋傅军上月进扰冀中腹地之所谓“集团进军”以重大杀伤，迫使蒋傅军仓惶逃回保定。各地方兵团自六月下旬至本月初旬于上述各地共作战一百三十五次，毙伤俘蒋傅阎军二千二百余名，缴获甚众，拆毁敌碉堡五十余座。平津保三角地区我强大游击兵队曾于七月二十九日以秋风扫落叶之势，一举将新城东北大清河西岸伪王凤岗部之碉堡二十三座全部扫除。向平绥路两侧挺进之天阳游击兵团于攻克天（镇）阳（原）公路上重要据点贾家屯，完全控制该公路之后，复分兵一部北越平绥路将天镇县属路北广大地区完全收复，与在察北活动之冀察热人民解放军遥相呼应。流窜于冀中之蒋傅军，曾到处遭我地方部队阻击，自七月二十一日至二十八日被民兵以冷枪地雷伏击毙伤的即达八百余名。
