　　Tang Fude Cables Shanghai Relief Organization
  　Accuses Chiang Kai-shek's Planes of Bombing Dikes
  　Demands Expedited Shipment of Relief Supplies to Shandong
    [Xinhua News Agency, Shandong, 19th] Tang Fude, Director of the UNRRA Shandong Agricultural Rehabilitation Office, cabled Mr. Green of the UNRRA in Shanghai on the 11th, accusing Chiang Kai-shek's bandits of sabotaging the governance of the Yellow River. The original cable stated: "Chiang's planes strafe the Yellow River dikes every day, and bomb them day and night without interruption. In the last three days, I have personally witnessed 66 bombs dropped along the dikes. No UNRRA vehicles can travel safely, day or night. If the dikes are still to be used for flood control, the air raids must be stopped immediately." Tang also requested the UNRRA to quickly transport relief supplies to the Bohai liberated area to aid the suffering compatriots.
    [Xinhua News Agency, Shandong, 19th] From the 9th to the 12th, Chiang Kai-shek's planes continued to indiscriminately bomb the area along the Yellow River in the Bohai region, which is over 300 li long and 21 li wide, more than ten times a day. In four days, nearly a hundred soldiers and civilians were killed or wounded, and 30,000 jin of straw and fodder were destroyed. Major losses included: On the 9th, two Chiang planes dropped four bombs on Qinghe Town and strafed for a long time, resulting in 24 casualties. On the morning of the 10th, multiple Chiang planes bombed the Lülü Damajia dangerous section, killing civilian laborers Shi Hualan and others. Two stone transport boats were sunk at the Wangjiazhuang dangerous section. More than 20 bombs were dropped on Lijin City, and the strafing lasted for more than an hour, destroying dozens of civilian houses and causing more than 30 casualties among residents. On the 11th, two Chiang planes sank a civilian boat in Qinghe Town. Of the 30 people on board, only six were rescued, and the rest were drowned. Rope maker Wang Youhai and two others were killed or wounded on the streets of the town. On the morning of the 12th, two Chiang planes dropped multiple incendiary bombs on the Dadao Wang dangerous section in Gaoyuan, destroying 32,000 jin of straw and fodder. Chiang Kai-shek's atrocities have turned the anger of the people along the river into strength, making them even more active in flood control. The Damajia dangerous section has been stabilized after emergency repairs. Engineering teams from Putai, Binxian, and Gaoyuan counties are stepping up their work, and 100,000 jin of straw and fodder have been collected in two days and made into eight sections of submerged "support piles and protective embankments," with a total length of over 100 meters, making the dangerous section even more consolidated.

　　汤孚德氏电沪联总
  　控诉蒋机炸堤
  　要求速运救济品赴山东
    【新华社山东十九日电】联总山东农业整理主任汤孚德氏十一日于此间致电上海联总格林先生，控诉蒋贼破坏治黄罪行。原电称：“蒋机每日沿黄河堤扫射，并昼夜投弹，迄无间断。近三日据我目睹，已沿堤投弹六十六枚。联总任何车辆，无论昼夜均不能安全行驶。如仍望以御堤水，则空袭应即停止”。汤氏并要求联总将救济物资迅速运来渤海解放区，以救济被难灾胞。
    【新华社山东十九日电】九日至十二日，蒋机在渤海区沿黄河长三百余里，宽二十一里之地区，继续滥炸，每日在十次以上，四天内死伤军民近百人，被毁秸料三万余斤。其中损失较大者计有：九日蒋机两架，在清河镇投弹四枚，扫射多时，伤亡二十四人。十日晨，蒋机多架轰袭利律大马家险工，炸死民夫石花兰等二人。在王家庄险工处击沉运石船两只，在利津城投弹二十余枚，扫射一小时以上，毁民房数十间，伤亡居民三十余名。十一日，蒋机两架在清河镇击沉民船一只，船上三十余人除六人得救外，余均被淹没，并在该镇街上毙伤绳匠王友海等三人。十二日晨，蒋机两架在高苑之大道王险工投燃烧弹多枚，毁秸料三万二千余斤。蒋贼暴行使沿河人民变激愤为力量，抢险更加积极。现大马家险工经抢修后，已告平稳。蒲台、滨县、高苑三县工程队加紧工作，十万斤秸料两日内全部筹齐，并作成下水“顶桩护堰”八段，全长百余公尺，该险工已益臻巩固。
