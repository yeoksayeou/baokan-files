　　·Shaanxi-Gansu-Ningxia Border Region Disaster Victims Resettle and Resume Production·
    [Xinhua News Agency, Northwest, 18th] With the vigorous relief efforts of the democratic government and the extensive mutual assistance of the masses, disaster victims in the Shaanxi-Gansu-Ningxia Border Region have quickly resettled and resumed production. In June and July, Chiang's troops twice "mopped up" areas under the jurisdiction of the Yan'an and Suide Special Prefectures, implementing a scorched-earth policy. The Border Region Government sent personnel to tour various locations amidst the fighting, comforting the disaster-stricken people. Emergency relief was provided in nine counties, including Yan'an and An'sai, under the Yan'an Special Prefecture, allocating 1,175 *shi* of grain, lending 219 million Border Region currency, and 2,600 *jin* of cotton. The mutual assistance and relief efforts of the masses in various locations are even more touching. Under the intense struggle against the "mopping-up" operations, Zhidan donated 100 *shi* of grain, and Jingbian contributed 30 *shi* of wheat, sending them to the Zichang masses who suffered more severely under Chiang's troops. Furthermore, cadres and the masses in Zichang displayed a high degree of camaraderie. Even though the Second Township in the southern district was extremely short of grain, they still allocated 6.6 *dou* of rations to provide emergency aid to disaster-stricken neighbors. In another district, four townships mutually assisted with over 15,000 *jin* of straw. Mutual assistance with cattle, labor, and farm implements was extremely common in various areas. With everyone's help, the disaster victims quickly resumed production. After the safe transfer of over 10,000 people from Panlong, Fengfu, Mudan, and other districts in Yan'an County, they have all been properly resettled with the assistance of the local government and the masses, and are participating in the local wheat harvest and autumn weeding.

　　·陕北灾民安家生产·
    【新华社西北十八日电】陕北战区灾民在民主政府大力救济和群众广泛互助下，均已迅速安家生产。六、七两月内，蒋军曾两次“清剿”延属及绥德两专署所属地区，实行七光政策。边府在战火中派员巡回各地，抚慰灾黎，曾于延属专署延安、安塞等九个县进行急赈，拨粮一千一百七十五石，贷出边币两万万一千九百万元及棉花二千六百斤。各地群众之互助救济更令人感动。在反“清剿”的紧张斗争下，志丹捐粮一百石，靖边献麦三十石，送交受蒋军蹂躏较重的子长群众。而子长干部及群众更表现高度的友爱精神，南区二乡虽极端缺粮，仍调剂口粮六石六斗急救受灾邻里，另一区四个乡互助谷草一万五千余斤。绥德击退蒋军后，义合等区群众立即运粮十二石，种籽五石，送发田庄区受灾群众。各地牛工与农具的互济极为普遍，灾民在大家帮助下迅速恢复生产。延安县蟠龙、丰富、牡丹等区万余群众安全转移后，在驻地政府与群众协助下，均已安置妥善，参加当地收麦锄秋。
