The Guo Daozhen Trading and Transportation Agency

　　The Guo Dao Trading and Transportation Agency was established in January of this year according to market needs and public demand. In the past six months, it has done a lot of work beneficial to commercial transportation, which is very different from the old exchanges in the past. Therefore, merchants, porters, and even farmers have good feedback on it.

　　The old exchanges inherited the tradition of historical official management. They did not introduce transactions, and sometimes forced the masses to weigh goods there and pay handling fees. The masses also regarded the transaction handling fees as a burden, without considering the convenience of buying and selling. The Guo Dao Trading and Transportation Agency first changed the nature of official management and allowed the masses to run it themselves. They did not have any privileges. The masses were free to decide whether to go through the agency for buying and selling. They were not forced to weigh goods elsewhere and were not interfered with (except for the black market). If the masses bought and sold goods without their introduction, they did not emphasize the collection of handling fees. However, under the principle of merchants' voluntary consent, they generally gave them handling fees, because the merchants felt that weighing and accounting were convenient. If they made a sale through their introduction, they were responsible for weighing and helping with accounting, and only charged a 1% handling fee, with no charge for small amounts (three to five jin).

　　Another feature of this exchange is that it actively contacts the masses and actively introduces buying and selling. In January, a person from Pingyao brought six jin of mercury to Guo Dao for sale. Because it was a less popular item, it could not be sold at a good price. Later, it was taken to the agency, and they found connections everywhere. Finally, they introduced it to a Jincheng customer. In June, Wang × from Pingyao also brought some less popular goods (more than one hundred jin of white fabric), which were also sold through their introduction. The trading agency did not charge the masses extra for their hard work. This spring, raw materials for the Guo Dao dye shop were in short supply. The agency sent a letter to a merchant they knew in Changzhi, introducing and selling more than twenty jin of quick blue dye to the Guo Dao dye shops, without charging any handling fees. At that time, the masses saved a lot of money dyeing cloth with the dye that arrived, and they were all very satisfied. The agency often piled up many things that the masses asked them to sell on their behalf, such as hemp bark, cotton, salt, etc., which was also very convenient for the farmers. For those who bought goods, the agency sometimes even advanced money. Once, they lost five thousand yuan in accounting. When the seller came, the buyer had already left, so they immediately advanced the money on behalf of the buyer, and it took a long time before they got it back from the buyer.

　　In addition, they also introduce transportation. Like introducing transactions, they did not reduce their work enthusiasm because they did not charge handling fees. In March, thirty vehicles from Tunliu came to Guo Dao to deliver public grain. Because they could not find anything to haul back in empty vehicles, the drivers saw an advertisement in the inn that the agency introduced transportation for customers, so they found the agency and asked them to find a return load. They walked around the street for a while, but there was nothing that could be shipped immediately. Finally, they thought that Taihua Company had a large batch of hemp bark to be transported to Changzhi. They ran to Taihua Company again. At the beginning of the contact, the people there were unwilling to ship, but after the agency's people repeatedly explained and mobilized the merchants to help the drivers solve their difficulties, they received 10,000 jin of hemp bark, with a freight rate of 30 yuan per jin. The general market price was 35 yuan per jin, and it was not easy to hire porters. In this way, Taihua Company saved 5 yuan per jin, a total of 50,000 yuan. The drivers also increased their income by 300,000 yuan, which solved a great difficulty. Such an introduction of return loads can not only increase the income of porters but also save merchants' freight costs.

　　The agency also usually has the responsibility of investigating and mastering prices, establishing economic blackboards, checking weights and measures, inspecting commodity quality, and educating merchants and porters. Now, the Guo Dao Trading and Transportation Agency has become an indispensable organization for merchants and farmers. (Taiyue Branch)

### 郭道镇交易运输介绍所

　　郭道镇交易运输介绍所
    郭道交易运输介绍所，是在今年一月份根据市场需要与群众要求成立起来的。半年来它做了不少有利商业运输的工作，和过去旧交易所迥然不同，因此商人脚夫甚至农民对它都有好的反映。
    过去的交易所是继承了历史官办的传统，他们不介绍交易，且有时还强制群众到他们那里过秤交纳手续费，群众也把交易手续费当成一种负担；没有从为买卖方便去看。郭道交易运输介绍所首先改变官办性质，让群众自己办，他们没有任何特权，群众做买卖通过介绍所与否听其自便，不强制在别处过秤也不干涉（黑市例外），群众做买卖不经他们介绍单过一下秤也不强调收手续费，但在商人自愿的原则下，普通都给他们手续费，因为商人感到过秤算帐都方便。如经过他们介绍做了买卖负责过秤帮助算帐，只收百分之一的手续费，少的（三、五斤）不收。
    这个交易所另一特点是：主动与群众联系，主动给人介绍买卖，一月份平遥人拿来水银六斤，在郭道出售，因是冷货贵贱卖不了，后来拿到介绍所，经他们到处找关系，最后介绍卖给了晋城客人。六月份平遥王×也拿来了些冷货（白一百余斤）经他们介绍，也卖了。交易介绍所并没有因为出力大多收群众的报酬。今春郭道染坊原料奇缺，介绍所给长治认识的商人去了信，介绍卖给郭道各染坊快青二十余斤，一点没有抽手续费；当时染料来了群众染布省了好多钱，都很满意。介绍所经常堆积着许多群众叫他们代卖的东西，如麻皮、棉花、盐等，农民也很便利，对于买货的介绍所有时还要垫钱。有一次算帐亏了五千元，卖主来时买主已走了，他们当即代买主垫钱，事后很久才向买主要回来。
    此外他们还介绍运输，和介绍交易一样，没有因为不收手续费降低他们的工作热情，三月份有屯留三十辆车送公粮来郭道，因回去空车找不到拉的，车夫们晚上在店房看到介绍所代客介绍运输的广告后，即找到介绍所叫他们设法介绍回脚，他们在街走了一阵，也没有顺脚马上起运的东西，最后想到太华号有往长治运的一大批麻皮，他们又跑到太华去，接头时人家开始不愿起运，后经介绍所的人再三解释动员商人应体车夫解决他们的困难，结果接到了麻皮一万斤，每斤运价洋三十元，一般行市每斤三十五元，还不易雇脚，这样在太华说来，每斤少出脚洋五元，合起来共可省洋五万元；车夫也增加了收入，计三十万元，解除了很大困难。如此介绍回脚既能增加脚夫收入又可省了商人脚费。
    介绍所平常还负有调查掌握物价，建立经济黑板，校对度量衡，检查商品质量、教育商人脚夫等责任。现在郭道交易运输介绍所，已成为商人农民不可少的一个组织。（太岳分社）
