Xinhua News Agency, Jicha Rehe Liao, 4th. (Delayed) The Jidong People's Liberation Army recaptured Lulong County on July 21st. The defending Kuomintang troops fled towards Wanggezhuang, south of the Luan River. This city was once captured by the People's Liberation Army during our spring offensive, but was later occupied by the Kuomintang troops.

Xinhua News Agency, Jicha Rehe Liao, 3rd. The 塞北 People's Liberation Army guerrilla force, fighting inside and outside the Great Wall and active in the heartland of the Kuomintang-Fu Zuoyi troops, is growing stronger day by day. Since the People's Liberation Army withdrew from Zhangjiakou last October, this people's light cavalry has advanced into northern Chahar, northern Rehe, and around Zhangjiakou, controlling vast rural areas and constantly attacking the enemy. Fu Zuoyi once mobilized superior forces, including the 13th Army's 89th Division and the New 31st Division, to carry out frenzied "sweeps" and "suppression." The guerrilla force fought bravely, attacking Chongli County, an important enemy stronghold, three times in a row, and thwarting the enemy's conspiracy of encirclement. At the beginning of January this year, the enemy gathered more than a thousand cavalry and infantry to carry out an "encirclement and suppression." The brave men of the team braved the wind and snow outside the Great Wall and fought hard along the hundred-mile Great Wall line for half a month. In the most difficult situation, they marched one hundred and forty li all night from the high snow-capped mountains of more than two thousand meters, and finally successfully broke the enemy's "encirclement and suppression" plan. According to incomplete statistics, from December last year to May this year, the guerrilla force fought a total of 49 battles, an average of one battle every three days.

    冀东再克卢龙
    塞北游击队奋战长城内外
    【新华社冀察热辽四日电】（迟到）冀东解放军七月二十一日再度收复卢龙县城，守城蒋军向滦河以南王各庄方向逃窜。按该城于我晨季攻势中曾一度为解放军攻克，后又被蒋军侵占。
    【新华社冀察热辽三日电】转战长城内外活跃于蒋傅军心脏地区的解放军塞北游击队声势日益壮大。自去年十月解放军撤出张家口后，这一支人民轻骑队即挺进于察北、热北与张垣周围，控制了广大乡村，不断袭击敌人。傅作义曾调集十三军八十九师、新三十一师等优势兵力，进行疯狂“扫荡”与“清剿”，该游击队英勇奋战，一连三次袭击敌人重要据点崇礼县城，粉碎了敌人的合击阴谋。今年一月初，敌又纠集千余骑步兵，进行“围剿”，该队健儿冒塞外风雪，沿百余里长城线，辗转苦战半月之久。形势最恶劣时，曾自高达二千余公尺的大雪山彻夜行进一百四十余里，终于胜利击破敌人“围剿”计划。据不完全统计，该游击队自去年十二月至今年五月，先后共作战四十九次，平均三天作战一次。
