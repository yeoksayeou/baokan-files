Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, August 12th: Tokyo dispatch: The Allied Council for Japan met on the 7th and held a 40-minute discussion. The Soviet representative, Kirilenko, raised three questions regarding the resumption of Japan's trade, demanding answers from the US representative, Acheson. First, he demanded the publication of the types and quantities of goods imported and exported by Japan. Second, what methods were being adopted to promote Japanese production? Third, he demanded an explanation of the reasons hindering Japanese production. Acheson was speechless in the face of the Soviet proposals, revealing his embarrassment. He attempted to evade the questions by claiming "difficulties in compiling a large amount of material" and that "Allied headquarters officials are excessively busy," and refused discussion, using the excuse that "this discussion will infringe upon the activities of the Far Eastern Commission." Since the US imperialists began "controlling" Japan two years ago, the Japanese economy has now become an appendage of US monopoly capital. The US side's unreasonable rejection of the Soviet representative's legitimate proposal to disclose the monopolization of the Japanese economy fully exposes their "guilty conscience."

Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, August 12th: Tokyo dispatch: August 15th is the date the United States has permitted Japan to resume foreign trade. It is confirmed that 205 types of Japanese goods will be dumped on the world market at that time. To encourage the revival of Japanese industry, MacArthur announced on the 9th that when Japan resumes foreign trade, the United States, Britain, and Canada may send 137 commercial representatives to Japan to establish trade relations with Japanese merchants. However, in order to ensure that Japanese zaibatsu obtain sufficient profits, various discriminatory treatments are imposed on foreign companies other than those in the US orbit doing business in Japan. According to the regulations in the trade relations between foreign and Japanese merchants: 1. Prices and all expenses are calculated in US dollars. 2. Foreign merchants can only exchange US dollars for military scrip or Japanese yen at designated banks. 3. Foreign merchants do not have freedom of movement in Japan and must first apply for a travel permit before traveling to major Japanese cities. Foreign merchants must also pay fares in US dollars when taking cars provided by the Japan Trade Bureau. According to a Tokyo dispatch on the 10th, the Japan Shipping Bureau announced that next spring Japan will have 28 ships with a total weight of 33,700 tons to develop the Japanese shipping industry and ensure that Japanese trade is unimpeded domestically. Under all these monopolistic measures of MacArthur, Japanese financial groups will revisit their old tricks of economic aggression and endanger the world.

　　苏代表责问恢复日本对外贸易
  　美方做贼心虚哑口无言
    【新华社陕北十二日电】东京讯：对日委员会于七日集会，举行了四十分钟的讨论，苏代表基连科对恢复日本贸易问题提出三点质问，要求美方代表艾其森答复。第一、要求公布日本进出口货物种类及其数量；第二、采取何种方法促进日本生产；第三、要求说明妨碍日本生产之理由。艾其森对苏方建议哑口无言窘态毕露，借口“编纂大量材料困难，”“盟总官员过分忙碌，”以图搪塞，并以“此项讨论必将侵犯远东委员会之活动”为辞，拒绝讨论。按自美帝国主义“管制”日本两年以来，日本经济现已成为美独占资本的附庸。苏方代表要求美帝国主义公布独占日本经济之正当建议，竟遭美方无理拒绝，充分暴露其“做贼心虚”。
    【新华社陕北十二日电】东京讯：本月十五日为美国准许日本恢复对外贸易之日，据确悉，届时将有二○五种日货倾销世界市场。麦克阿瑟为了鼓励日本工业之复兴，又于九日宣布日本恢复对外贸易时，美英加三国可派商业代表一百三十七人赴日，与日商建立贸易关系。但为保证日阀获得充分利润对美国以外的外围公司在日经商加以种种歧视待遇。据外商与日商贸易关系中规定：一、物价及一切费用均以美元计算。二、外商只能在指定的银行以美元换取军用票或日圆。三、外商在日本各地无通行自由，必须先申请旅行证，然后才能来往日本各大城市。外商搭乘日本贸易局所供给之汽车，亦须以美金支付车费。另据东京十日讯，日本航务局宣称：明春日本将有二十八只，重三万三千七百吨的船只，以发展日本航海业，并使日本贸易在国内畅行无阻。在麦克阿瑟所有这些独占措施下，日本财阀将重袭经济侵略之故技危害世界。
