　　Northeast Cultural Snippets
    ◇ The Songjiang Lu Xun Arts Troupe recently collectively created one hundred popular colored comic strips depicting the heroic fighting at the front, the masses in the rear actively engaging in the struggle to overturn their lives, and various scenes of democratic construction. They were publicly exhibited, and attracted a large audience. In addition, the troupe's "New Foreign Films" (a type of slideshow performance) touring and singing in the countryside of Mudanjiang were also very popular with the masses. The troupe's lantern slide film has been transported to Harbin and is scheduled to be shown soon.
    ◇ The Songjiang Department Store, the largest department store in Harbin, has a bright and clean display window extending fifty or sixty meters in the first department store. The "Northeast Pictorial", depicting pictorial reports of construction and mass movements in various places, and the "Democratic Northeast" sample film of the Northeast Film Studio are posted here, which are very popular with the audience.
    ◇ The Harbin Ten Cinema Joint Association was established in early July and decided to use after-work hours to broadcast domestic and foreign news, and organize elementary school students to perform clapper talks, short plays, lantern slides, set up wall newspapers, and open reading rooms.
    ◇ The "Youth Lecture Series" organized by the Qiqihar People's Youth Headquarters began in early last month and has many listeners.
