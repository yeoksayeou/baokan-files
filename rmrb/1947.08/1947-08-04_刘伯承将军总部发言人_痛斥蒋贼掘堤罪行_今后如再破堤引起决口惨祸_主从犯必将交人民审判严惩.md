Xinhua News Agency, Frontline of Hebei-Shandong-Henan, 1st - The spokesperson for General Liu Bocheng's Field Headquarters issued an urgent warning regarding the crimes of the murderous villains Chiang Kai-shek and Liu Ruming in destroying the Yellow River dikes, stating: Chiang's troops have repeatedly destroyed river dikes, committing heinous crimes. The 68th Division and one cavalry brigade of Liu Ruming's forces occupied Linpuji north of Heze on July 29th, forcibly breaching the dikes. Fortunately, our river defense troops repelled them and assisted the local people in urgent repairs, preventing a major disaster. After suffering disastrous and irreparable defeats in his treasonous military endeavors, Chiang Kai-shek resorted to such a vicious and insane tactic, determined to destroy the lives and property of millions of people along the river. Liu Ruming has forgotten that he is a native of North China, disregarding the lives and deaths of his ancestral graves, hometown elders, and brothers, brazenly executing Chiang's reckless orders, which is truly outrageous. The spokesperson stated: We seriously warn the principal offender Chiang Kai-shek and Liu Ruming, etc., that if their continued destruction of river dikes or obstruction of dike repairs causes the Yellow River to breach, regardless of whether it is the principal offender Chiang Kai-shek or the responsible military officers who execute the dike breaching, they will be handed over to the people's court for severe punishment. Even if they escape to the ends of the earth, they will be arrested and brought to justice. Even if they themselves die, their descendants must bear responsibility. The spokesperson also protested to the UN Relief and Rehabilitation Administration (UNRRA), stating: If UNRRA does not take effective measures to prevent the occurrence of such atrocities, it cannot evade its due responsibility.

Xinhua News Agency, Hebei-Shandong-Henan, 1st (Urgent Dispatch) - Liu Ruming's troops, commander of the Fourth Pacification Zone under the Chiang regime, executed Chiang Kai-shek's reckless orders, destroying the river dikes near Linpuji on the south bank of the Yellow River. The situation is extremely serious. Since the 26th of last month, Liu Ruming's troops have been harassing Linpuji north of Heze City. On July 29th, the 68th Division and one cavalry brigade occupied Linpuji, destroying three sections of transverse wood at the Jiangsu Dam danger zone two li west of Linpuji and breaching the dike by more than one zhang, creating an extremely dangerous situation. Our river defense troops immediately fought bravely to repel the enemy and quickly assisted the local people in urgently repairing the damage, fortunately preventing a major disaster. Now the river water continues to rise, and in the areas of Xiaoliuzhuang and Gaozhuang, sorghum stalks from the breached dike are already flowing with the water. The people along the river are extremely indignant at Chiang Kai-shek's insane behavior and are now on strict alert day and night.

Xinhua News Agency, Shanxi-Hebei-Shandong-Henan, 1st - Our correspondent inspected Yuncheng and the Zhongdui danger zone, discovering Chiang Kai-shek's massive conspiracy to breach the dikes. During the period when Chiang's troops occupied the area, the democratic government's accumulated materials for dike repair, such as wooden stakes, had been burned. Sixteen deep trenches, each one and a half meters wide, had been dug on the 216-foot dike, and two hidden bunkers had also been dug, completely perforating the dike. The most severe damage was done to the Xin Sao. The water-facing dam, which had been repaired by our liberated area, had been completely destroyed. The democratic government is now leading the masses to rush to repair and save themselves. On the afternoon of July 22nd, the correspondent personally witnessed two enemy planes flying low and circling over the danger zone, constantly strafing our dike repair workers with machine guns.

    主从犯必将交人民审判严惩
    【新华社冀鲁豫前线一日电】刘伯承将军野战司令部发言人，顷对蒋介石刘汝明等杀人凶犯破坏黄河堤岸之罪行，提出紧急警告称：蒋军迭次破坏河堤，罪恶滔天，刘汝明部六十八师两个团，与骑一旅一个团，复于七月二十九日侵占菏泽以北之临濮集，强行掘堤，幸经我河防部队击退，并协助当地人民紧急修复，未酿成巨灾，蒋贼在其卖国军事迭遭惨败无可挽救之后，竟出此丧心病狂之毒辣手段，决心毁灭沿河数百万人民之生命财产，而刘汝明亦竟忘记自己是华北人，不顾其祖宗坟墓及桑梓父老兄弟之生死，悍然执行蒋贼乱命，实令人发指。发言人称：我们严重警告主犯蒋介石及刘汝明等，今后如因彼等继续破坏河堤，或阻碍修堤，而引起黄河决口之惨祸，不论主犯蒋介石及执行破堤负责军官，必将交给人民审判，严加惩办。即令逃至天涯海角，亦必通缉归案。即其本人死亡，其子孙亦须负责任，发言人最后并向联总提出抗议称：联总不采取有效办法防止此种暴行之发生，自不能辞其应负之责任。
    【新华社冀鲁豫一日急电】蒋记第四绥区指挥官刘汝明部，执行蒋贼乱命，掘毁黄河南岸临濮集附近河堤。形势极为严重。刘汝明部自上月二十六日以来，即由菏泽城向以北之临濮集出扰，其所属六十八师两个团与骑一旅一个团，于七月二十九日侵占临濮集，将临濮集以西二华里之江苏坝险工横木破坏三处，掘堤一丈余，形势异常危急。我河防部队当即奋勇阻击，将敌击退，并迅速协助当地人民紧急堵复，幸未酿成巨灾。现河水继续上涨，大小刘庄、高庄一带，已见河堤被破坏处之秫秸随水流下，沿河人民对蒋贼如此丧心病狂，愤慨万分，现正日夜严密戒备中。
    【新华社晋冀鲁豫一日电】本社记者视察郓城，仲＠堆险工，发现蒋贼掘堤之巨大阴谋。当蒋军盘踞时期，民主政府，原积修堤木桩等资材，已被焚毁，仅在二百一十六尺的堤坝上，挖有十六道一公尺半宽的深沟，并挖暗堡两个，该堤全被挖透。破坏最狠者为新埽。原经我解放区修好之迎水坝，已挖毁无遗，民主政府正率领群众抢修自救。七月二十二日下午，记者亲见敌机两架，至该险工处上空低飞盘旋，并向我复堤工人以机枪不断扫射。
