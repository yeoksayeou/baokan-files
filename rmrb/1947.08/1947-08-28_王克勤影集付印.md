　　Wang Keqin Photo Album to be Printed
    The People's Daily Press of the Political Department of the Jin-Ji-Lu-Yu Military Region is currently preparing to compile and print a photo album of patriotic hero Wang Keqin, who bravely killed the enemy. A selection has already been made from dozens of photos of Wang Keqin in combat, training soldiers, leading troops, and helping each other learn, and is being printed and bound into a book. The content includes Wang Keqin educating new soldiers on disassembling machine guns, mastering weapons proficiently, helping each other learn, sharpening knives and training soldiers, educating new soldiers to remain calm in battle, seize opportunities, and use firepower, educating new soldiers under fire to use terrain and ground features for earthwork, and Wang Keqin being selected as a first-class enemy-killing hero of the entire brigade, leading comrades in the entire platoon to formulate plans to kill the enemy and make meritorious deeds, and scenes of the hero and the masses.

    Each photo in the album is intertwined with bravery and skill, and the vivid image of combat and training combined, and clear educational content. The beginning of the volume contains a memorial article by Commander Liu mourning Wang Keqin, as well as thousands of words of explanation and a brief biography of Wang Keqin. It is truly the best educational textbook for the company. (Sha Ping)

    影集的每幅像片，都绞织着勇敢和技术，作战与训练合的生动形象，和鲜明的教育内容。卷首有刘司令员悼唁王克勤纪念文一篇，并有数千字的说明和王克勤略。实为连队最好教育课本。　　　　　　　　　　（沙坪）
