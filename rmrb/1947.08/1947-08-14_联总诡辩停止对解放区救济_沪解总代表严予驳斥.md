　　Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 12th. According to a Shanghai dispatch from the Associated Press on the 8th, UNRRA has been quibbling about its erroneous actions in halting relief to the liberated areas, even shifting the responsibility to the CCP, saying that this "should be blamed on both the government (Chiang) and the CCP." Lin Zhong, representative of the Shanghai Relief Association office, issued a statement sternly refuting this, pointing out that only the Kuomintang government had obstructed the transport of relief supplies to the liberated areas, and questioned UNRRA: "Does it hope that relief supplies will be transported to the liberated areas? Or is it promoting propaganda for the Chiang government?" He reiterated that "UNRRA cannot shirk its responsibility for the suspension of relief supplies to the liberated areas. Its act of violating the basic agreement on the non-partisan distribution of relief supplies is actually helping the Chiang government by indefinitely delaying UNRRA's plan to transport supplies to the liberated areas for relief."

　　联总诡辩停止对解放区救济
  　沪解总代表严予驳斥
    【新华社陕北十二日电】据合众社上海八日消息：联总曾为其停止对解放区救济的谬误行为进行诡辩，甚至将此项责任同时诿给中共方面，谓此“应归咎于政府（蒋）及中共双方。”上海解总办事处林仲特发表声明严予驳斥，指出只有国民党政府曾阻挠救济物资运往解放区，责问联总“是希望救济物资运往解放区呢？还是替蒋政府宣传？”再次指出“救济物资停运解放区，联总决不能辞其咎，它破坏了不分党派分配救济物资的基本协定的行为，实际上是在帮助蒋政府，以无期限的延迟联总将物资运往解放区救济计划。”
