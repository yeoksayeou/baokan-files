Xinhua News Agency, Northeast, 31st—Students from various parts of Northeast China are going to the countryside during their summer vacations to help the masses achieve emancipation. More than 600 middle school and university students, along with more than 40 faculty members from Harbin, joined the Summer Vacation Rural Work Group and went to various districts in the suburbs on the 28th to assist in land reform work. More than 200 students from Heilongjiang-Nenjiang Province spontaneously organized a battlefield service team, which went to the newly recovered areas on the 27th to help the masses carry out the struggle for liquidation and revenge. The summer vacation propaganda team organized by Songjiang Provincial Normal School went deep into the countryside to conduct land reform propaganda.
    [This newspaper, Taiyue, 6th] Under the leadership of our democratic government, schools in various counties of the Jinan New District have resumed classes one after another. As of the 6th of last month, the number of schools resumed in Wanquan and Jishan counties included two middle schools, eleven higher elementary schools, and two hundred and fifty-two elementary schools. In Wanquan county alone, the number of male and female primary and secondary school students regularly attending school reached more than 8,000. Many people who were unwilling to send their children to school under the rule of Chiang Kai-shek and Yan Xishan are now sending their children to school one after another. In particular, the number of female students has greatly increased, accounting for about one-half of the total. These schools have abolished the system of corporal punishment, and students have organized student unions to lead their own autonomy.
