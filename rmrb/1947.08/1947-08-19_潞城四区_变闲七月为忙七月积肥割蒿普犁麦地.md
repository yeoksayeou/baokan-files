　　Lucheng Fourth District
  　Transforming Idle July into Busy July by Accumulating Fertilizer, Cutting Artemisia, and Plowing Wheat Fields
    [This newspaper's Lucheng dispatch] The Fourth District's autumn harvest is half-way through the third weeding. Some people say: "Plowing the summer fallow once yields a bowl of oil, plowing it twice yields half a bowl of oil, plowing it three times yields no oil at all. After the Beginning of Autumn, put away your hoes." They believe July is an idle month. The leadership discovered this situation and held expanded cadre meetings on the 12th of this month to discuss how to turn idle July into a busy July, proposing to increase grain production, expand income, accumulate large amounts of fertilizer, eliminate wasteland, and expand wheat fields, focusing everything on increasing grain production and striving for an early summer harvest next year. Wang Libao and Wang Xiaosan said: "Our village will complete the third weeding in another five days. The main task now is to accumulate fertilizer. We should mobilize the masses to launch a concentrated effort to cut artemisia, scrape sod, dig high streets, scrape wall plaster, beat the kang, and sweep road dust. As the saying goes: 'A broom is a growing pile of manure.' We can also mobilize people to fill land, mixing red soil with white soil, two and a half measures per mu. Last year, each mu of land received eight cartloads of manure. This year, by organizing the accumulation of manure, our village can apply an average of ten cartloads to each mu of wheat field, which can increase grain production by one and a half dou per mu." Chen Tianfu, a hero of land reclamation at Podi, plans to expand all 300 mu of melon fields, bean fields, and small hemp fields in the village into wheat fields. He will accumulate fertilizer and haul it to the edge of the fields first, and while harvesting the autumn crops, he will rush to plant wheat, applying more fertilizer and striving to harvest the same as the regular wheat fields. During the discussion on eliminating wasteland, each village conducted an inspection and resolved to turn all wasteland into wheat fields. Whoever plants this year will not be burdened with any expenses for one year. Cadres in Guzhang and Huangnian guarantee not to leave a single plot uncultivated. After the discussion, each village is now universally launching a campaign to complete the third weeding, concentrating on accumulating fertilizer, cutting artemisia, and braking wheat fields.

    [This newspaper's Lucheng dispatch] On the 6th of this month, the Zhai Dian cadres and activists organized an inspection of topdressing. They found that the masses had a sense of complacency, believing that the autumn seedlings were growing well. If all the manure was applied to the autumn fields, there would be no fertilizer for planting wheat. It would be better to leave some manure for the wheat fields, especially since the newly emancipated households lacked manure. Therefore, they immediately focused on the positive aspects and first conducted an accounting. The whole village had 4,100 mu of autumn fields. Applying topdressing to each mu would increase grain production by two dou, which would increase grain production by 400 shi, enough to meet the annual public grain quota. This cleared the masses' minds. On the 7th, four brigades applied topdressing to a total of 300 mu. In the campaign to apply topdressing and weed the seedlings three times, women and children also actively took action, formulating fertilizer accumulation plans. Each woman was required to complete the task of cutting 900 jin of artemisia manure for three mu of wheat fields. In addition to attending school and organizing propaganda teams to carry out propaganda, the children planned to cut artemisia, sweep street ash, accumulate three large piles of fertilizer, and solve the fertilizer shortage for military families. According to statistics on the 7th, 25 women cut a total of 1,500 jin of artemisia, and children swept out 20 loads. The campaign to cut artemisia and accumulate fertilizer is now being vigorously launched. (United Office)

　　潞城四区
  　变闲七月为忙七月积肥割蒿普犁麦地
    【本报潞城讯】四区秋收有一半完成三锄，群众有的说：伏搂地一碗油，二伏搂地半碗油，三伏搂地没啦油，立秋搂瞎圪搂，立了秋，挂锄勾。认为七月是个闲月。领导上发现这种情况，于本月十二号分别防召开来扩大干部会议，进行讨论，要把闲七月变成忙七月，提出增加产粮，扩大收入，大量积肥，消灭荒地，扩大麦田，一切从增加粮食着眼，争取明年夏季早收。王里堡、王小三说：“我村锄苗再有五天就完成三遍了，现在主要是积肥，应发动群众突击割蒿、刮草皮、挖高街、刮墙皮、打炕、扫道土；俗语说：扫帚，粪堆长。也可发动填地，红土搅白土，每亩两石五。去年每亩地上八车粪，今年组织起来积粪，我村每亩麦地平均上十车，每亩可增加产粮一斗半”。坡底翻身英雄陈天福计划全村瓜地、豆地、小麻地三百亩，都扩大为麦田，积起肥就先拉到地边，一面收秋，一面就赶麦，多上肥，争取和正茬麦地一样收。讨论消灭荒地时，各村进行了检查，决心把荒地都变成麦田，今年谁种上一年不出负担。故漳、黄碾干部保证一分不留。经过讨论后，各村现正普遍展开完成三遍苗、突击积肥割蒿、刹麦地运动。（兴福）
    【本报潞城讯】翟店于本月六日干部积极分子组织检查上追肥情况，发现群众有自满思想，认为秋苗长的不错，要是把粪都上到秋地，种麦就没有肥料，还是留下些粪上麦地吧，新翻身户特别缺粪。于是即抓积极面，首先进行了算帐，全村四千一百亩秋地，每亩上追肥多增二斗粮，能增粮四百石，够出全年公粮，打通了群众思想，七号一天四个大队共上追肥三百亩。在上追肥，锄三遍苗运动中，妇女、儿童也积极的行动起来，订出积肥计划，要求每个妇女完成三亩麦地九百斤蒿粪的任务，儿童除上学组织宣传队进行宣传外，计划割蒿扫街道灰，积肥三大堆，给军属解决缺肥问题。据七号一天统计，二十五个妇女，共割蒿一千五百斤，儿童扫出二十担。现割蒿积肥运动正在大力展开。（联合办公室）
