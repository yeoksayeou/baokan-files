Xinhua News Agency, Northwest, 4th. The Northwest People's Liberation Army is utilizing breaks in combat to conduct intensive training. One unit, focusing on siege warfare, conducted exercises over three days ranging from platoon and company level offensive drills to corps-level operations, from daytime assaults to nighttime raids, from approaching operations and fire support to scaling city walls with ladders and assaulting castles and engaging in street fighting. One company set a new record for ladder construction during city assaults. One squad, starting from a point fifty meters from the city, delivered ladders to a city wall more than three *zhang* high in just one minute and twenty seconds. A platoon of twenty-eight men all climbed the city wall and deployed firepower within twenty minutes. During a grenade throwing test, soldiers like Shen Jinwang threw thirty consecutive grenades from a point twenty meters from the city, each one flying over the crenellations, and all but one hitting the target. During a demolition exercise, flashes of light and explosions occurred simultaneously, and smoke and yellow dust filled the sky. The soldiers cheered and demanded that everyone learn demolition. Their slogan is: "Sweat more in training, bleed less in battle! Improve combat effectiveness and eliminate Hu Zongnan!"

    攻坚战术提高
    【新华社西北四日电】西北人民解放军利用战斗间隙，紧张练兵，某部在三天中以攻坚为中心课程，从班排进攻演习到兵团作战，从白昼强攻演习到夜间袭击，从迫近作业，火力掩护架云梯爬城演习到爆炸城堡与巷战。某部一连创造攻城架梯新纪录，一个班由距城伍拾米地点出发，仅一分二十秒，即将云梯送到三丈余高的城墙上。一个排二十八人，二十分钟内即全部登城展开火力。某部测验投弹，战士沈金旺等在距城二十米处向城上连投三十枚手榴弹，每颗飞越垛口，除一枚外，余均命中目标。当爆破演习时，火光炸声齐作，烟雾黄土蔽空，战士们齐声叫好，要求人人学会爆破。大家的口号是：“演习多流汗，战斗少流血提高战斗力消灭胡宗南。”
