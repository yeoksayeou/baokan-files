Xinhua News Agency, Shandong, 18th. The Bohai District, combining land reform re-examination, has launched a summer defense movement against Chiang Kai-shek's puppet agents. The border areas are now covered with landmine networks. Shouguang militiamen and local armed forces have launched explosive attacks on Chiang Kai-shek's puppet strongholds, killing 18 Chiang Kai-shek's puppet soldiers in a week. Enemy strongholds on the north side of the economic line feel seriously threatened. They dare not enter the fortifications dug today tomorrow. When they go out on patrol, they are even more apprehensive, fearing to "eat sweet potatoes" or "take an airplane" (Translator's note - a reference to landmines and explosions). The interior of Shouguang is conducting a exposure movement in the re-examination process to eliminate the refuge of bandits and special agents. Liang Jinde and other enemy elements sent by the enemy from Gongsunzhuang to infiltrate our core team were all captured after an assassination attempt. Huang Wenyou and other Chiang Kai-shek special agents sent from Jinan to Qingcheng were captured as soon as they stepped into the liberated area. The Shishe community in Linyi initiated a "wipe the weapons campaign." If one village is in alert, the surrounding villages will reinforce it. Even if a special agent is exposed, it is difficult for them to escape. The First Sub-district (around Leling, Yanshan, and Cangxian) held a special summer defense conference last month. Each county established a joint defense headquarters to uniformly command the local armed forces and the militia, and implemented a curfew throughout the district. All travelers are registered village by village, and rewards and punishments are implemented in anti-espionage and anti-banditry operations.
    Xinhua News Agency, Shandong, 16th. The Bohai troops actively support the peasant emancipation movement. The entire guard battalion of the Fourth Sub-district participated in village work, and more than 30 cadres above the squad leader level were dispatched to participate in the land re-examination in the Xiawa District of Zhanhua. Battalion Commander Shan of the battalion expressed to the peasants that they were determined to be good sons of the peasants, giving soldiers if the peasants needed them and guns if they needed them. He also handed over all the clothes of his landlord Wang Rongyin hidden in the soldiers' rooms to the farmers' association. The ordnance factory of the sub-district discovered that Wan Jincai and Mou Rongsan, feudal forces from Mou Village, had infiltrated the factory and immediately sent them back to the masses in Mou Village. The rear guard office of a certain field army helped the peasants in the stationed village to overthrow the big tyrant Liu An and others. Deputy Political Commissar Pan of a certain unit, who was born into a landlord family, wrote a letter to the farmers' association in his village expressing his willingness to hand over all his family property to the farmers' association for disposal. The commanders and fighters of the main forces and local armed forces who were from landlord and rich peasant backgrounds also wrote letters to their families one after another, urging their fathers and brothers to implement the land reform decrees of the democratic government, and expressing their attitude to the farmers' associations in their hometowns, to support the farmers. The Qingcheng Public Security Bureau used public security work to help the masses search for and arrest Chiang Kai-shek special agents who hindered the peasants' emancipation, and handed them over to the masses for disposal during the peasants' liquidation.
