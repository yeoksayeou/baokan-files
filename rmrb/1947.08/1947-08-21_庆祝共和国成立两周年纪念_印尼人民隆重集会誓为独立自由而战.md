  　Indonesian People Hold Grand Rally Vowing to Fight for Independence and Freedom
    [Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 19th] Jakarta dispatch: The Indonesian people gathered on the 17th to celebrate the second anniversary of the founding of the Republic. President Sukarno and other Indonesian military and government leaders were present to preside over the event. Vice Premier Gani delivered a speech stating: The Indonesian people are fighting heroically for independence. In the midst of war, we should not forget our Independence Day. The Dutch war of aggression has threatened world peace. We should not rely on United Nations arbitration and relax our mission to fight for independence. President Sukarno called on the Indonesian people to turn their homes into fortresses under the orders of the Republican government. Indonesian Army Commander-in-Chief Sudirman firmly believes that "as long as freedom remains in our hearts, we will never be defeated by the enemy. The Indonesian people are fighting for a sacred ideal, and victory will surely belong to us!"
    [Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 15th] The Executive Committee of the World Federation of Democratic Youth has issued a call to young people around the world, stating: Only two years have passed since the end of the war against Germany and Japan, and war has broken out again in Indonesia. At this moment, Dutch warships and bombers are destroying Indonesian villages and towns, using force to suppress their demands for freedom and independence. The outbreak of the Indonesian war coincides with the meeting of the International Youth Conference. This is nothing less than a challenge to democratic youth and the United Nations worldwide. We call on young people around the world to take action and do everything possible to end this war of aggression.

　　庆祝共和国成立两周年纪念
  　印尼人民隆重集会誓为独立自由而战
    【新华社陕北十九日电】日惹讯：印尼人民于十七日集会庆祝共和国成立两周年纪念，苏加诺总统等印尼军政要人均亲临主持。副总理盖尼发表演说称：印尼人民为争取独立正在英勇战斗。在战争中，应不忘我们的独立纪念日；荷兰的侵略战争，已威胁世界和平，我们不应依赖联合国仲裁而松懈为独立而奋斗的任务。苏加诺总统吁请印尼人民在共和国政府命令下，将家庭变为堡垒。印尼军总司令苏迪曼坚信“要自由仍在我们心里，我们决不会被敌人击败；印尼人民为神圣理想而战，胜利必属于我们！”
    【新华社陕北十五日电】世界民主青年联盟执行委员会，顷向全世界青年发出号召称：对德、日的战争结束才两年，战争又在印度尼西亚爆发了。此刻荷兰的军舰与轰炸机正在摧毁着印尼的村镇，用武力镇压他们的自由独立要求。印尼战事的发动，正当国际青年大会集会期间，这不啻是全世界向民主青年及联合国挑战，我们号召全世界青年行动起来，竭力终止此种侵略战争。
