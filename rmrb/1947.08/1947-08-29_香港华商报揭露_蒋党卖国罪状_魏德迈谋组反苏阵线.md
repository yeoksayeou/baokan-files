Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 27th: Chiang Kai-shek's acts of selling out the country for aid during Wedemeyer's visit to China continue to be revealed. According to a TASS dispatch from Nanjing on the 26th, the Hong Kong "China Business News" recently published a cable from Shanghai stating: "Chiang Kai-shek proposed to Wedemeyer to equip and train twenty infantry divisions (containing sixty brigades), urgently re-equip twelve artillery battalions, supply three hundred bombers and two hundred fighters, and provide a loan of two billion US dollars for reforming the financial system and developing trade and industry. In return, Chiang Kai-shek promised to lease strategic bases of greatest interest to the United States, allow the US to send military, political, economic, social, and cultural delegations or advisory groups to China, stationing them indefinitely in Nanjing to supervise the enforcement of Sino-American commercial treaties and other agreements, and grant Americans in China equal rights with Chinese citizens."
	Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 26th: Tokyo News: Wedemeyer arrived in Tokyo on the 24th. According to a United Press dispatch on the 24th, Wedemeyer's trip, in addition to listening to MacArthur's report on the situation in Korea, will also discuss with MacArthur the so-called "role Japan can play in preventing communism in the Far East barrier" and plans to organize a Japanese-Chiang-Korean anti-Soviet front. The dispatch also stated that Wedemeyer's mission is a manifestation of Marshall's European plan expanding to the Far East. Wedemeyer intends to suggest further assistance to Chiang Kai-shek, and Wedemeyer will also "come up with the best way" to assist the US-occupied area of South Korea. Wedemeyer is scheduled to fly to Seoul on the 26th. Wedemeyer's "investigation" of China and Korea's ulterior motives has been exposed once again.

  　魏德迈谋组反苏阵线
    【新华社陕北二十七日电】魏德迈在华期间蒋介石卖国求援之行为续被揭露。据塔斯社南京二十六日电香港华商报顷刊载来自上海的电讯称：“将介石曾向魏德迈提出装备与训练二十个步兵师（包含六十个旅），紧急重新装备十二个炮兵营，供给轰炸机三百架，战斗机二百架，贷款二十亿美元，以供改革金融制度与发展贸易，工业之用等项要求，蒋介石则答应以美国所最感兴趣的战略基地租借与美国，美方并得派遣军事、政治、经济、社会与文化代表团或顾问团来华，无限期的留驻南京，借以监督中（蒋）美商约及其他协定的复行，并予在华美人以与中国公民平等权利。”
    【新华社陕北二十六日电】东京讯：魏德迈于二十四日飞抵东京，据合众社二十四日电称，魏氏此行除听取麦克阿瑟关于朝鲜情况的报告外，并将与麦氏商讨所谓“日本在防止共产主义的远东屏障中能起的作用”，并计划组织日蒋韩反苏阵线。该电又称，魏氏之出使，系马歇尔之欧洲计划扩大至远东之表现。魏氏拟建议对蒋贼作更进一步之援助，同时魏氏亦将“想出最好的方法”，援助南韩美占领区。魏氏定于二十六日飞汉城。魏德迈“调查”中国与朝鲜的鬼胎，又一次暴露出来。
