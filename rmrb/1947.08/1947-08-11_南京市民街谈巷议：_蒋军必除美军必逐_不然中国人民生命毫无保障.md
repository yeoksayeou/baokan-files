　　Nanjing Citizens' Street Talk:
    Chiang's Troops Must Be Eliminated, American Troops Must Be Expelled
    Otherwise the Lives of the Chinese People Will Have No Guarantee
    【Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 9th】Nanjing dispatch: After the tragic incident in which American imperialist troops illegally stationed in China directly caused the drowning of two of our compatriots by American military police in Nanjing, Chiang and the US colluded to try to whitewash the American military police's crime of murder. More than a week has passed since the tragedy, and the Chiang government has not uttered a single fart about it, while Chiang's Central News Agency has become a defender for the American military police criminals. First, they said it was "drunkenness," and then they changed the military police to "American troops," trying every possible way to exonerate their American masters. Scared by the public outrage of the Chinese people, the US military advisory group claimed that they had "detained" the two American military police criminals, and Captain Bomar, the commander of the military police unit, also claimed on the 3rd: "After investigation by the US military, sufficient evidence has been obtained regarding the crimes of the two soldiers." (United Press) However, under the protection of the "US Military Privileges Act" formulated by the traitor Chiang Kai-shek, the US military advisory group has announced that the American military police criminals will be tried separately by a military court established by the US side. US Chief of Staff Hastings even left a loophole for exonerating the US military at a press conference on the 7th, saying: If it is "unintentional manslaughter (!), the sentence will be less than three years imprisonment." (Central News Agency) Since the US government declared the US military rapist Pearson not guilty, the Chinese people have been extremely resentful. Now, old and new hatreds are coming one after another. People in the streets and alleys of Nanjing believe that if Chiang Kai-shek's traitorous rule continues and American imperialism is not expelled from China for a single day, then the Chinese people may become the second Wang Shouben and Ge Fatian at any time.

　　南京市民街谈巷议：
    蒋军必除美军必逐
    不然中国人民生命毫无保障
    【新华社陕北九日电】南京讯：美帝国主义非法驻军中国所直接造成的南京美宪兵淹死我同胞两人惨案发生后，蒋美即狼狈为奸企图洗脱美宪兵杀人罪行。惨案迄今已逾一周，蒋政府对此屁也没放一个，而蒋家中央社反成为美宪兵凶犯辩护人。初则曰“酗酒”，继又将宪兵改为“美军”，千方百计为其美国主子洗脱罪名。美军顾问警慑于中国人民公愤，声称业已将两美宪兵罪犯“扣押”，该团宪兵队长波马尔上尉亦于三日声称：“美军方面经调查后，对该二队军人之罪状，已获得充分证据。”（合众社）但在卖国贼蒋介石所制订的“美军特权法案”包庇下，美军顾问团已宣布：美宪兵罪犯将由美方成立军事法庭，单独自行审判。美军参谋长赫斯丁斯上校七日竟在记者招待会预为美军洗脱罪名留下伏笔，说：如果是“无意过失杀人罪（！）则为三年以下徒刑。”（中央社）自美政府宣判美军强奸犯皮尔逊无罪之后，中国人民痛恨万分，现旧恨新仇相继而来，南京街头巷口均认为：蒋介石卖国统治下去，美帝国主义一日不驱逐出中国，则中国人民随时均有成为王守本、葛发田第二的可能。
