　　Not Afraid of Not Knowing Goods, Only Afraid of Comparing Goods
  　Big Se Village and Zhuangjia Village Organize Mutual Aid
    [Dispatch from our reporting team on the 25th] Our reporters visited Big Se Village in Xingtai. In the village outskirts, we happened upon representatives selected by the groups who were observing the quality of the crops and judging the harvest. The farmers following the representatives on their tour were all beaming with anticipation to learn the results of their labor. Wu Laochuang's stubble-planted millet, because he didn't apply topdressing fertilizer, was seven or eight inches shorter than others' and the millet ears were half as thin. According to the representatives and its owner's estimation based on past experience, Wu Laochuang's millet would yield one cloth bag per mu (approximately 104 jin), Sun Tong's millet could yield two cloth bags, and Wang Shu's millet could yield another one-half more than Sun Tong's.

    Wang Shu told reporters: "My millet was planted in the ridges before the wheat harvest. The county called for topdressing fertilizer, and I used 70 jin of seed cake per mu." At this time, the farmers watching all said, "Look, mere words don't count! When we were told to apply fertilizer, no one was willing to part with it. Now they regret it!"

    Zhang Mingli's mutual aid group was compared with Wang Shu's group. Zhang Mingli's group was established later and hoed the autumn millet three times; Wang Shu's group hoed it four times. For each less hoeing, the average yield per mu would be reduced by one big dou. Zhang Mingli said: "Our mutual aid was late, so we suffered a loss. I knew that hoeing one more time could increase the harvest, but we just couldn't manage it."

    The next day, Big Se Village began to compare itself with Lüjiatun, which was less than one li away. The sorghum, corn, and millet of Big Se Village were all one chi taller than those of Lüjiatun; one side was growing golden yellow, while the other was growing green. According to the usual years, the crops of Lüjiatun would yield an average of one big dou less per mu. For 610 mu of autumn seedlings, this would mean a reduction of 61 shi. The village cadre representatives of Lüjiatun grumbled and said, "Mutual aid wasn't organized, the crops were hoed only three times at most, and no topdressing fertilizer was applied. We really don't have the conditions to compare with them. Our spring millet can only match their stubble-planted millet."

    Big Se Village had a good harvest this year. The village had 242 mu of land. In the past, only one season was harvested, but this year two seasons were planted, yielding 72 shi and 6 dou more than in previous years; 125 mu of dry land was converted into paddy fields, yielding 18 shi and 7.5 sheng more; 52 mu of wasteland was reclaimed, yielding 2 dou per mu, totaling 10 shi and 4 dou; 1987.2 mu were hoed four times, yielding 118 shi and 6 dou and 8 sheng more than when hoed three times in previous years; 100 mu were topdressed with fertilizer, yielding 20 shi more. In total, the village increased production by 240 shi, 4 dou, and 3 sheng this year.

    Through the crop comparison movement, the farmers of Big Se Village truly realized the benefits of mutual aid. The leadership seized this opportunity and immediately convened a general meeting to rectify mutual aid in order to carry out the autumn harvest and wheat planting. Chairman Wang Shu first asked the masses present at the meeting: "Why are the crops in Lüjiatun not growing well?" The masses answered in unison: "They didn't organize mutual aid." He announced that they would rectify the mutual aid groups today, and the masses started talking one after another. Wu Fenglin grabbed the opportunity to say: "In the past, I was a semi-laborer, cultivating 12 mu of land. Now I cultivate 28 mu of land. Before mutual aid, I only thought about cultivating the military dependents' land well this year, which was good. Who knew that by cultivating the military dependents' land well, my own land was also hoed four times. Not to mention the autumn crops, this year's wheat harvest was 11 cloth bags more than last year. Is mutual aid good or not? Let everyone speak fairly!"

    Gao Wenzeng said: "Gao Gengchen and I are in the same group. At the beginning, we felt it was good. There was a companion to work with. Later, we thought that Wang Shu and Wang Qing's groups had implemented labor points. Wang Shu also told me: This way, no one suffers. Gengchen and I discussed implementing labor points, but Gengchen felt that two people could manage and no one would take advantage of anyone. Later, I realized that Gengchen had three or four more mu than me. Since we were doing the same work, he must be suffering. I think we have been in mutual aid for a short time. If it were longer, we might start to feel resentful." Zhang Laoduo said: "Although I wasn't forced to participate in mutual aid, I wasn't happy in my heart. I saw that everyone else was participating, and I was afraid others would say I was stubborn. Now I know the benefits of mutual aid. If participating in mutual aid is still voluntary, I won't participate in the east side. I'll join Wang Qing's group." The masses all spoke their minds. The chairman said: "What do you think we should do with our mutual aid?" Some said: "The whole village should practice mutual aid." Some said: "Re-establish, with voluntary leadership."

    At this time, Wang Shu said: "Re-establishment is also voluntary. It should be automatic registration to ensure that it is not forced." The masses echoed: "Yes! Yes! That's how it should be." The meeting ended satisfactorily.

    The village originally had 30 mutual aid groups, with over 100 households participating. Only 16 groups truly practiced equal exchange. The other 14 groups were nominal. Now the masses have reorganized themselves into seven large groups (divided into 24 small groups). The whole village is practicing equal exchange. Each member carries labor points with them, exchanging labor points after each shift. Except for 22 households whose landlords were struggled against, 15 households of military dependents, and 7 households with no labor force, all households in the village have joined the mutual aid groups.

### 不怕不识货只怕货比货　大色比庄稼整互助

　　不怕不识货只怕货比货
  　大色比庄稼整互助
    【本报记者团二十五日电】记者访问邢台大色村，在村郊恰巧遇到小组推选出来的代表们正在观察庄稼的好坏，评判收成；尾随代表参观的农民们，都喜气洋洋的想知道自己劳动的结果。该村吴老闯的麦茬谷，因没上追肥，与别人的比起来低七、八寸，谷穗子细一半。据代表们和他的主人根据往年经验估计，吴老闯的谷每亩能收一布袋（合一百零四市斤），孙通的谷可收两布袋，王书的谷子比孙通的又可多收二分之一。
    王书告记者说：“我的谷子是收麦以前在垅里种的。县里号召上追肥，每亩光花籽饼就上了七十斤。”这时，参观的农民都说：“看看，光说不算，那会叫谁上粪，谁也舍不得，这会可后悔了！”
    张明理互助组与王书组比，张明理成立较晚，秋谷锄了三遍；王书组锄了四遍，少锄一遍的每亩平均要少收一大斗。张明理说：“咱互助的晚吃了亏，我知道多锄一遍能多收，就是顾不过来。”
    第二天，大色村开始和相距不到一里地的吕家屯比。大色村的高粱、玉茭、谷子均比吕家屯的高一尺，一边是长的黄澄澄的，一边长的绿油油的。按平常年景计算，吕家屯的庄稼平均每亩少收一大斗，六百一十亩秋苗，就要少收六十一石。吕家屯的村干代表都嘟嚷着说：“互助没有搞起来，庄稼顶多锄三遍，又没上追肥，真没有条件和人家比。咱村的春谷只能顶上人家的麦茬谷。”
    大色村今年收成不错，全村有二百四十二亩地，过去都是收一季，今年种了两季，比往年多收七十二石六斗；旱地变水地一百二十五亩，多收十八石七斗五升；开荒五十二亩，每亩收二斗，共十石四斗；锄四遍的共一千九百八十七亩二分，比往年锄三遍时可多收一百一十八石六斗八升；上追肥的一百亩，可多收二十石，总计全村今年共增产二百四十石零四斗三升。
    经过比庄稼运动，大色村农民真正认识到互助的好处。领导上抓紧这个火候，马上召集大会，整顿互助，以便进行秋收种麦。主席王书首先问到会群众：“吕家屯庄稼为什么长的不好？”群众异口同音回答说：“他们没有互助起来。”他宣布今天要整顿互助组，下面就接二连三的说开了。吴凤林抢着说：“我过去一个半劳力，种十二亩地，现在种二十八亩地。没互助前我光想着今年把军属地种好就不错，谁知道种好了军属的地，自己的也锄了四遍。不说秋庄稼，今年麦子就比去年多收了十一布袋。互助倒底好不好，大家伙公平说吧！”
    高文增说：“我和高庚琛是一组，开始时，还觉着不错，做活有个伴，后来就心思着人家王书、王庆组都实行了晌票，王书还我说：这样都不吃亏。我和庚琛商量着也实行晌票吧，庚琛觉着两个人怎么也行，都是一手人，谁还能吃了谁的亏？后来想起来，庚琛因比我多三、四亩，都是一样样做活，一定吃亏。我看俺两个互助时间短，时间若是久了，说不定心里起蹩扭。”张老多说：“我参加互助虽说不是强迫的，反正心里不痛快，自己看着别人都参加了，我不参加怕别人说我是顽固头，这次可知道互助好处啦。参加互助还要自愿的话，我不在东边参加，参加王庆组。”群众把心里的话都说出来了。主席说：“大家看咱们的互助该怎么办吧？”有的说：“全村互助。”有的说：“重成立，自愿领头。”
    这时王书说：“重新成立也是自愿的，还是自动报名，保险不强迫。”群众又随声应和的说：“对！对！，就是这样。”会议圆满的结束了。
    该村原有三十个互助组，参加的有一百多户，仅有十六个组真正实行了等价交换，其他十四组都是有名无实，现在群众自己重新组成七大组（内分二十四个小组），全村实行了等价交换，每个组员都随身带着晌票，每晌做完活后就交换晌票。全村除二十二户被斗地主、十五户军属及七户无劳力户外，全部参加了互助组。（朱波）
