◇ After a period of infighting and exclusion in the Northeast Kuomintang military command structure, following the removal of Du Yuming and the promotion of Sun Liren to Deputy Commander-in-Chief of the Army, a reorganization has taken place. The Chiang-controlled Northeast Security Command Headquarters was formally incorporated into the Northeast Headquarters on the 20th. The original Deputy Commanders of the Northeast Security Command Headquarters, Zheng Dongguo, Ma Zhanshan, Sun Du, etc., were appointed as Deputy Directors of the Headquarters, Commander of the Songbei Pacification Command, and Corps Commander, respectively. In the future, all Kuomintang troops in the Northeast "will be directly and uniformly commanded by the Headquarters." The appointment of Sun Du, a pro-Chiang direct lineage general, as Corps Commander of the Northeast Kuomintang Army is a tactic used by Chiang Kai-shek to ease the intense contradictions between the Yunnan Army and the central direct lineage troops in the Northeast. Although Du Yuming still holds the nominal title of Deputy Director of the Headquarters in this reorganization, he ended his "isolated residence" in Shanghai on the 19th and quietly departed.
◇ Chen Cheng continued to rush around in the Northeast. From the 10th to the 18th, he ran to Kaiyuan, Fushun, Jinzhou, Changchun, Yongji, Sipingjie, Anshan and other places to "inspect" the defense areas. Sun Liren also went to the Northeast on the 13th, repeatedly stating that "the Communist army may seize all of Manchuria," and that "Changchun, Shenyang and other important cities may be re-isolated." Therefore, the anxiety of his subordinates is increasing daily.
◇ According to a United Press dispatch on the 17th: Chiang Kai-shek is now directly commanding the Shandong battle via radio and aircraft. The annihilation of Feng Zhi'an's 38th Brigade and 37th Brigade in Feixian was completed under his direct command.

　　蒋区零讯
    ◇东北国民党军事指挥机构，经过一度倾轧排挤，杜聿明被撤、孙立人升任陆军副总司令后，已行改组。蒋记东北保安司令部于二十日正式并入东北行辕，原东北保安司令部副长官郑洞国、马占山、孙渡等分任行辕副主任，松北靖司令官及兵团司令官，今后东北所有国民党部队“均由行辕直接统一指挥”。亲蒋的嫡系将领孙渡之被任为东北国民党军兵团司令官，是蒋介石用以缓和在东北的滇军与中央嫡系部队的剧烈矛盾的手腕。杜聿明在此次改组中虽仍挂了行辕副主任的虚名，但彼已于十九日结束其上海“孤居”，悄然出。
    ◇陈诚继续在东北奔忙，从十日至十八日，他跑了开原、抚顺、锦州、长春、永吉、四平街、鞍山等地“视察”防地。孙立人亦于十三日去东北，一再表示“共军可能略取全部满洲”，“长春、沈阳及其他重要城市可能重新被孤立”。因而其部下之不安日增。
    ◇据合众社十七日消息：蒋介石现正经由无线电和飞机直接指挥山东战事。费县冯治安部三十八旅及三十七旅之被歼，即在其直接指挥之下完成者。
