　　Tuenliu Increases Production After Rain Wuyi Waters Seedlings and Harvests Vegetables
    [This newspaper, Taiyue, 20th dispatch] Tuenliu's movement to increase production through conservation after the rain has achieved great results. From July 25th to August 5th, according to statistics from only fifteen villages including Zhangdian, 9,522 mu of abandoned land were eliminated, and 10,244 mu of buckwheat and rapeseed were replanted. Collective efforts harvested over 472,000 catties of wild vegetables, saving 829 shi and 3 dou of grain. Zhangdian in particular achieved the greatest results. After setting production increase and conservation plans for each household at a mass meeting, 400,000 catties of wild vegetables were harvested and 455 mu of abandoned land were eliminated within five days, and rapeseed and buckwheat have already been planted. In addition, each person managed to save two liang of millet and two qian of salt per day. After the thorough rain on the 28th, each district promptly put forward clear slogans such as "Don't let a single person or animal be idle, eliminate wasteland, rush to plant late autumn crops, hurry to plow wheat fields, and women and children gather wild vegetables." The Fifth District broke the "it doesn't matter" mentality by comparing this year's situation with last year's. As a result, villages such as Luowuyuan have successively launched movements to save one he of rice and eliminate wasteland per person per day. The director of the Longmenkou Military Committee organized the entire village's labor force to eliminate 138 mu of abandoned land. They are now cutting artemisia and fermenting manure to ensure that more manure is applied to the wheat fields to compensate for the losses caused by the drought in the first half of the year.
    [This newspaper, Jinnan, 19th dispatch] Wuyi waters seedlings to fight drought and harvests vegetables to prepare for famine. At first, the masses in Renjiao Village couldn't agree on watering the seedlings, saying, "It's better not to water them; watering them will only kill them. If you water them, you have to water them every day; watering them a little is just a waste of time!" After repeated discussions, it was unanimously agreed that watering is better than not watering, and saving one seedling counts as saving one. They proposed that saving seedlings is saving lives. It was decided to uniformly organize the entire village's labor force to first water the seedlings that are about to dry out, and rush to water the seedlings whose leaves are wilting. Two earthen wells were dug that day, and half a mu of land was watered. The experience was gained that watering underground is better than watering above ground (digging pits next to the seedlings, watering them, and then covering them with soil can withstand drought). Villages such as Wangdong used wooden sticks to poke several holes next to the seedlings, irrigating the water to the roots of the seedlings, and the soil around the seedlings was soaked a large area. The Seventh Subdistrict of the First District proposed, "Praying to gods for rain is useless; rescuing seedlings makes great contributions." One hundred and eighty men and women from Heilin Village turned out in force, using six cartloads of water to water the seedlings. Feng Furong and his wife from Thirty Li Pu watered one mu of sorghum with plenty of water for two nights, and the sorghum was lush and green, extraordinarily strong. The masses in various villages have begun to eat vegetables. Wang Junxing, a family of nine in Daliuzhuang, saves half a jin of wheat every day by mixing vegetables with their food.

    【本报太岳二十日电】屯留雨后节约增产运动，已获巨大成绩，自上月二十五日起，至本月五日止。十天内仅据张店等十五个村的统计，消灭熟荒九千五百廿二亩，补种荞麦、油菜一万零二百四十四亩，合作打野菜四十七万二千余斤，节约粮食八百二十九石三斗。尤以张店成绩最大。在群众大会上，按户订出增产节约计划后，五天即打野菜四十万斤，消灭熟荒四百五十五亩，并已种上油菜荞麦；此外每人每天做到节约小米二两、食盐二钱。各区在二十八日透雨后，及时提出不闲一人一畜，消灭荒地，抢种晚秋，赶犁麦地，妇女儿童打野菜等明确口号。五区按去年的年景和今年比较的办法，打破了大家“不要紧”的思想。由此罗吾元等村，纷纷开展每人每日节约一合米及消灭荒地运动。龙门口武委会主任，组织全村劳力消灭熟荒一百三十八亩。现正割蒿沤粪，做到麦地多上粪，以弥补前半年旱灾的损失。
    【本报冀南十九日电】武邑浇苗抗旱，采菜备荒。任角村群众起初对浇苗都打不通，说：“不浇还好，一浇准死”；浇就得天天浇，浇一星半点瞎胡闹！”经再三争论，一致认为浇就强似不浇，浇活一棵算一棵。提出救苗即救命。决定统一组织全村劳力，先浇快干死的苗，抢浇将枯卷叶的苗。当天挖土井两眼，浇地半亩。得出经验，浇暗水不不浇明水（在苗旁挖坑、浇后蒙土，能忍旱）。王栋等村则在苗旁以木棒扎数个洞，至苗根处灌水后，苗周围浸湿土一大片。一区七小区提出（祈神求雨不中用，抢救大苗立大功”。黑林村男女一百八十人齐出动，六轮大车拉水浇苗。三十里铺丰福荣两口人，两晚上将一亩高粱浇的满地明水，高粱青芒芒，格外的壮。各村群众已开始吃菜，大刘庄王俊兴九口人，掺菜每天省下斤半麦。
