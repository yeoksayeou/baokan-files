    Seize the Opportunity to Sow Autumn Vegetables
    Renzhuang Production Committee Formulates a Post-Rainfall Crash Plan
    [This newspaper reported] The Renzhuang Village Production Committee of the Second District of Licheng held a meeting on the morning of July 28th amidst heavy rain to discuss post-rain replanting and seedling protection work, organizing the masses to increase production and overcome the famine in a timely manner. Shen Yuqin shared her practical experience from 1943, saying, "In 1943, Shen Da Zang's rapeseed sowing was even better than planting crops, yielding five or six dou per mu (each dou can be exchanged for one dou of rice)." Shen Benzhen said, "Sowing rapeseed will result in a harvest in the first season, the roots can serve as food, and the seeds can be exchanged for grain." As a result of the discussion, a five-day crash plan was formulated: universally sow rapeseed and buckwheat in small plots of land, and replant late crops, especially corn, in the vacant land within five days. The village plans to sow 300 mu of rapeseed. The masses in Tinghepou of the district, based on their personal experience of the 1943 famine, believe that famine-relief bran and vegetables can replace grain. Because of the drought and lack of rain, the sown vegetables could not sprout. Some households had labor but no river land, while others had river land but no labor, so they could not sow vegetables. The masses discussed and adjusted to each other. The whole village adjusted 10.03 mu of wheat land from eight households, and 37 households were able to plant vegetables. Under the leadership of labor hero Wang Lianxing, the team first sowed 12.9 mu of rapeseed and 7.6 mu of red radishes, and planned to sow another 31.9 mu of rapeseed. Under his influence, a total of 25 mu of rapeseed, 12.9 mu of red radishes, 15.8 mu of white radishes, and 3.7 mu of other vegetables were sown.

    [This newspaper reported] Zhao Kuijin, a labor hero from Hengling Village in the 11th District of Xingtai, calculated the following account for the masses: In the past, the village had 110 mu of sloping land, yielding two dou of grain per mu, for a total harvest of 22 shi; this year, the sloping land has no seedlings, which means a loss of 22 shi of grain. While organizing the masses to replant autumn vegetables, they also studied how to subsidize the poor harvest. Everyone agreed that applying more fertilizer to the paddy fields would increase the yield to subsidize the poor harvest on the sloping land. They immediately bought 2,211 jin of sesame cake and 2,775 dan of manure, all of which were used on 96 mu of paddy fields. Forty mu received 55 jin of sesame cake per mu, and 56 mu received 55 dan of topdressing fertilizer per mu. Now the millet has grown to waist-high. According to experienced farmers, this year the yield of paddy fields will increase by four dou of grain per mu (the average yield is eight dou per mu), and the village can increase grain by 38.4 shi, which is more than enough to subsidize the poor harvest on the sloping land. The morale of the masses is very high. (Xingtai Organized Small Newspaper)
    [This newspaper reported from] Huguan: Shatuo Village in the Fourth District has established a bran and vegetable warehouse and is carrying out a replanting and conservation campaign. On July 12th, there was a great hailstorm, and the seedlings were destroyed. The masses cried bitterly, but there was no way to recover. On the 17th, a mass meeting was held, and the cadres called on the people to replant and conserve to overcome the famine. After recalling the famines of 1942 and 1943, the masses' complacency was overcome, and a vigorous movement of eating bran and conserving was launched in every household. Everyone formulated the following plans: (1) The whole village has 42 households, 164 people, and 437 mu of land. 164 mu were hit by hail and completely destroyed. It was decided to replant barley, autumn vegetables, etc. In addition, each person will open 1.5 mu of wasteland, totaling 24.6 mu. Each fen can harvest 100 jin of radishes, and a warehouse will be organized after planting. (2) Each person will save two liang of millet per day, totaling 1,845 jin in three months, to be handed over to the warehouse every five days. (3) Each person will collect 25 jin of dried wild vegetables, totaling 4,100 jin, to be handed over every five days. Each group will contribute two dou of bran, totaling 32.8 shi, to be handed over every ten days.
    One warehouse director and two committee members were elected to be jointly responsible. (Ai Xiao, Fu Sheng)

    抓紧时机撒种秋菜
    仁庄生产委员会订雨后突击计划
    【本报讯】黎城二区仁庄村上月二十八日上午在大雨中召开生产委员会，讨论雨后补种保苗工作，组织群众及时进行增产渡荒。申玉芹拿了四三年的实际经验说：“申大赃四三年撒油菜比种庄稼还强，每亩打了五六斗（每斗能换一斗米）。”申本珍说：“撒油菜头一季收成，根能顶饭，籽能换粮。”讨论结果，订出了五天突击计划：小块地普遍撒油菜、荞麦，缺苗的空地，尤其是玉茭，在五天内全部补上晚作物，全村计划撒油菜三百亩。该区停河铺群众，根据四三年灾荒的亲身体验，渡荒糠菜能顶粮，因天旱没有雨，撒菜出不来，有的户有劳力没河地，有的有河地没有劳力，都不能撒菜。群众讨论互相调剂，全村八户调剂出麦地十亩零三分，三十七户能种菜的。在劳动英雄王连星带头下，全队首先撒油菜十二亩九分，红萝卜七亩六分，计划再撒油菜三十一亩九分。在他影响下，共撒油菜二十五亩，红萝卜十二亩九分，白萝卜十五亩八分，其它蔬菜三亩七分。（黎城保苗渡荒小报）
    【本报讯】邢台十一区横岭村劳动英雄赵魁进，给群众算了这样个帐：过去全村有坡地一百一十亩，每亩打二斗粮，共可收二十二石；今年坡地没苗，就要少打二十二石粮了。一面组织群众补种秋菜，同时又研究怎样补助歉收，大家一致认为水地多上肥多打粮，补助坡地歉收马上买了二千二百一十一斤麻饼、二千七百七十五担粪，都使到了九十六亩水地上，有四十亩每亩麻饼五十五斤，有五十六亩每亩追肥五十五担。现在谷子已长到腰来深，据一般有经验的农民估计，今年每亩水地要增产四斗粮食（平年每亩打八斗），全村可增粮三十八石四斗，补助坡地歉收还有余，群众情绪很高。（邢台组织起来小报）
