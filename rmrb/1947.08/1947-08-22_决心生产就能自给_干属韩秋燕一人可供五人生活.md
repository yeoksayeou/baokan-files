Determination to Produce Leads to Self-Sufficiency
　　Comrade Han Qiuyan Can Support Five People Alone
　　[Our Newspaper] The emulation drive at the Military Region Supply Department's Fourth Clothing Factory has expanded to family members, with their slogan being: "Self-sufficiency through production is merit." Comrade Han Qiuyan, a family member of a cadre, completed 170 padded coats in forty-five days (each coat earning a wage of 2.5 jin of rice), and 20 pairs of padded trousers (each pair earning a wage of 2 jin of rice), earning a total of 465 jin of rice. At market price, this is equivalent to 41,292 yuan. After deducting her one and a half month's expenses of 6,030 yuan, she has a surplus of 35,262 yuan, sufficient to cover the food and living expenses of five people. Zhao Xiulian completed 85 padded coats in one month, earning over 200 jin of rice, and has a surplus of 10,000 yuan after covering her own living expenses. Hou Kuiyu, a worker's family member, completed 80 padded coats in one month, earning 200 jin of rice. Li Kao, who is taking care of two children alone, completed 70 padded coats in July, earning 175 jin of rice. Wu Xiuliang, who is also taking care of two children alone, completed 20 padded coats and sewed 170 sleeve linings, earning enough to cover her own living expenses. How did they achieve such results? Han Qiuyan said, "It all depends on whether you have perseverance! I just have the ability to sit still and work diligently all day long, without going anywhere else. If you run around aimlessly, it won't work." She also said, "Speaking of my hands, they may be slow, but I don't take a midday break, and I work a little longer in the evening, and then I get it done." The factory's merit evaluation committee has awarded Han Qiuyan a meritorious service citation, and the other four comrades have received commendations. Currently, all the family members of the factory's employees are actively engaged in production under the encouragement of the slogan "See who comes out on top in August," striving to earn merit.

　　决心生产就能自给
  　干属韩秋燕一人可供五人生活
    【本报讯】军区供给部被服四厂的立功运动，已发展至家属中，他们的口号是：“生产自给就是功”。干属韩秋燕，四十五天套棉衣一百七十件（每件工资米二斤半），套棉裤二十条（每条工资米二斤），得米四百六十五斤，按市价合四万一千二百九十二元，除他一个半月消耗六千零三十元外，尚余三万五千二百六十二元，足供五个人的食用生活。赵秀莲一个月套棉衣八十五件，赚米二百多斤，除自己生活外，尚余一万元。工人家属候奎鱼，一个月套棉衣八十件，赚米二百斤。李考只带着两个小孩，七月份套棉衣七十件，得米一百七十五斤。武秀良也带着两个小孩，套了棉衣二十件，缝袖衬一百七十件，也够了自己的生活费用。他们怎样得到这样的成绩呢？韩秋燕说：“只看你有没有恒心！我就有一个坐心，一天坐下直干，哪里也不去；要是瞎跑瞎乱，那可就不行。”又说：“要说我的手吗？可也是很慢，可是咱晌午不歇晌，晚上多干会儿就有了。”厂的评功委员会，已给韩秋燕记功一次，其他四同志受到表扬。目前全厂职工家属，正在“八月里见高低”的口号鼓舞下，积极生产，争取立功。　　　（述恭）
