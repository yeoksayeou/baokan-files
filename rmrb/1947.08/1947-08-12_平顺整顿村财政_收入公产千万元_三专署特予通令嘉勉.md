　　Ping Shun Rectifies Village Finance
　　Income from Public Assets Reaches Tens of Millions
　　Third Special District Office Issues Commendation

　　[Our Taihang News] In order to reduce the burden on the people and overcome financial difficulties, the leadership of Ping Shun organized a vigorous rectification of finances. The county secretary personally wrote letters to several branch secretaries to open up their thinking. Under the enlightenment and promotion of the leaders, a mass movement to rectify finances was launched throughout the county. After 25 days, the following results were achieved: 1. Village Finance: 1. Out of 178 administrative villages in the county, 96 villages have been thoroughly rectified, 65 are generally rectified, and 17 are not thoroughly rectified. Generally rectified villages and thoroughly rectified villages account for over 94% of the total. The vast majority of the county has been rectified. 2. From the perspective of awareness: According to statistics from 105 administrative villages in four districts, based on the calculation that every yuan invested in public assets for production yields one yuan in profit each year, enough profit is generated in one year to cover all financial expenditures for two years, meaning there is a surplus of one year for 18 villages; a surplus of one year for 15 villages over two years; a surplus of one year for 6 villages over three years; 29 villages are self-sufficient without surplus; a total of 68 villages are self-sufficient with a surplus, accounting for nearly 65% of the total. 37 villages are insufficient to cover expenditures. 3. Statistics on income from public assets after rectification: Public asset liquidation amounted to 15,464,925 yuan in silver, 168,314 jin of rice, 41,536 jin of grain in cash, and 4,243,922 yuan in cash. The total value of grain converted to cash is 32,399,847 yuan (calculated at 60 yuan per jin of rice. In addition, a portion of rice was converted into materials, and eight administrative villages and one natural village were not included in the calculation), accounting for over 60% of the county's annual border expenses and military shoe burden. In addition, 962,799 jin of charity granary grain were cleared out, including 506,713 jin of grain currently in storage (statistics are missing from ten administrative villages). This not only ensures self-sufficiency in village finances, achieving the goal of reducing the people's burden and supporting the war, but also lays a material foundation for mass production and disaster relief.

　　After the village finances are cleared, a formal budget review system is established, management is strictly enforced, investment is inspected, and production is organized, mainly developing handicrafts, workshops, and transportation production, not engaging in commercial production. In addition, each village is encouraged to appoint one person to specialize in production, who is exempt from corvée labor, and land is mutually assisted and cultivated with wages paid. The surplus profit from production is divided by three-seventy or two-eight, etc., in principle, higher than the wages of mutual aid groups. In terms of management system, each village has two organizations: the Economic Committee and the Finance Committee. The Economic Committee is composed of three to five people, including the village head, political director, and armed committee director, responsible for overall control, studying expenditure budgets, and guiding business direction. The Finance Committee is concurrently managed by members of the Financial Committee of the village administrative system, responsible for controlling materials, implementing systems, and leading production. Expenditure procedures: Regular expenses are approved by the district based on the county government's budget estimate and filed for record. Temporary expenses are initially reviewed by the district and reported to the county for approval. Disclosures are made to the masses every three months, with the signatures and seals of the Economic Committee. In the future, thorough rectification will continue to be carried out, investigating concealment, liquidation, and production. (Shen Qin)

　　[Another News] The Ping Shun leadership, with a spirit of personally taking action, promoted the rectification of village finances throughout the county. Within a short period of 25 days, it completed the rectification work in over 94% of the villages, and put the rectified property into production. The profits alone can solve the village's financial expenditures. In some villages, the border grain funds may also be achieved without directly levying them from the masses, creating experience for future rectification of financial work. The Third Special District Office specially issued a commendation. (Yao Wen, Shen Qin)

　　平顺整顿村财政
  　收入公产千万元
  　三专署特予通令嘉勉
    【本报太行讯】为减轻人民负担，克服财经困难，平顺领导上组织大力整顿财政，县书曾亲笔给几个分书写信打通思想，在首长负责的启发和推动下，全县开展了群众性的整顿财政运动，经过二十五天时间，获得如下成绩：一、村财政：１、全县一七八个行政村，已整理彻底村九十六个，一般村六十五个，不彻底村十七个，一般村与彻底村，要占百分之九十四强，全县极大部分都整理了。２、从自觉程度上看：根据四个区一百零五个行政村的统计，按公产收入投资生产每元每年营利一元计，一年营利够二年全部财经费开支，即一年余一年者十八个村，二年余一年者十五个村，三年余一年者六个村，自给不余者二十九个村，共计自给有余者六十八个村，不足开支者三十七个村，自给有余占总数百分之六十五弱。３、整理出公产收入统计：公产变价洋一五、四六四、九二五元，变价米一六八、三一四斤，清出现粮四一、五三六斤，现款四·二四三、九二二元，粮折款合计三二、三九九、八四七元（每斤米六十元折款。另有部分米变价物资，和八个行政村一个自然村未计算在内），占全县全年边款军鞋负担百分之六十强。另外清理出义仓粮九六二、七九九斤，内有现存粮五○六、七一三斤缺十个行政村统计）。如此不但保证了村经费自给，达到减轻民负支援战争的目的，而且打下了群众生产渡荒的物质基础。
    村财政经过清理后，建立正规的预算审核制度，严格管理，检查投资，组织生产基本上是发展手工业、作坊、运输生产，不做商业生产。另外每村推造一人专搞生产，其本人免差，土地互助代耕出工资，生产余利分红，三七或二八不等，原则上要高于互助组工资。在管理制度上，每村有经委会，财委会两个组织。经委会由村长、政治主任、武委会主任等三人至五人组成，负责掌握全面，研究开支预算指导业务方向。财委会由村行政系统之财政委会会员兼办，负责掌握物资执行制度领导生产。开支手续：经常费根据县府概算由区批准报表备案，临时费经区初审报县批准。每三个月向群众公布一次，要有经委会签名盖章。今后还要继续彻底整顿，查埋伏、查变价、查生产。（申钦）
    【又讯】平顺领导上以亲自动手的精神，推动全县整理村财政，于短短二十五天时间内，完成了百分之九十四以上村的整理工作，并使整理出的财产投入生产，仅红利即可解决村经费开支。有的村边粮款将来也可能做到不直接向群众征收，给今后整顿财政工作，创造了经验，三专署特予通令嘉勉。（耀文、申钦）
