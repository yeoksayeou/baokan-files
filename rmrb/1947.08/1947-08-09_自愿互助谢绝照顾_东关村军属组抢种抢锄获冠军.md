    Voluntary Mutual Aid, Declining Special Care
    Dongguan Village Military Dependents Group Wins Championship in Rushing Planting and Hoeing
    [This Newspaper Reported] Under the call to save manpower, increase production, and support the front lines, 14 military dependent households in Dongguan Village, Qinghe Third District, including Li Shutian and Ge Liankui, voluntarily declined special care from the village labor force. Subsequently, the 14 military dependent households gathered together to discuss and study future production issues. Wu Yugeng said, "My four or five mu of land is nothing, but I lack livestock." Ge Liankui said, "Can't you just use the livestock in my yard?" Yugeng then said, "Then wouldn't it be even better if we worked together?" Then Xu Buyue (military dependents' representative) said, "Alright, let's not have the village take care of us. If we each do our own thing, our strength won't be enough. It's best if we form a mutual aid group, so that no one will have difficulty with their work." The others said in unison, "Very good, can't we ten people (five full laborers and five semi-laborers) with six livestock and a total of 128 mu of land handle it?" They all agreed to organize, and in order to maintain long-term mutual assistance, avoid freeloading or being taken advantage of, raise production enthusiasm, and consolidate the mutual aid group, they also conducted specific research to clarify work points. Their method of calculating work points was: one day counts as five work points (one in the morning, two in the afternoon), each work point is one jin of rice, semi-laborers also count as full work points (because although they are old, they still do a lot of work), and livestock count as double work points. At that time, Li Shutian was publicly elected as the group leader. After the meeting, they actively carried out mutual aid hoeing of seedlings. Now the autumn seedlings have been hoeed three times, and the late seedlings have been hoeed twice. Their production enthusiasm is very high, and they all feel very happy. The semi-sick military dependent Wu Yugeng often says to people, "Participating in mutual aid not only yields more from the land, but also allows me to live a few more years. I eat one more cornbread per meal than before." The masses are even more grateful, and they have been spreading the word: "It is right for us to take care of military dependents. The fact that military dependents decline labor to support the army makes us feel very sorry. Even though military dependents have declined, we should care for and take care of them even more, and we consciously go to help with the big jobs." Since then, the relationship between military dependents and the masses has become closer. In this model selection for rushing planting and hoeing, the military dependents group won the championship, and Li Shutian won the title of "Production Model." (Qinghe Small Newspaper)

    自愿互助谢绝照顾
    东关村军属组抢种抢锄获冠军
    【本报讯】清河三区东关村军属李书田、葛连奎等十四户在节省民力增产支援前线的号召下，自动辞退村中劳力照顾。此后，十四户军属集合一块讨论研究今后生产问题。吴玉庚说：“我这四五亩地不算事，只是缺少牲口”，葛连奎说：“咱那院里的牲口你还不随便使吗？”玉庚又说：“那么咱伙着作活，不是更好吗？”接着许步月（军属代表）说：“好了，咱都不让街上照顾，要是各干各的，力量是不够的，咱们最好成立起互助组来，谁的活也就不作难了。”其余人异口同声说：“很好，咱们十个人（五个全劳力五个半劳力）六个牲口共一百二十八亩地，还干不了吗？”遂都同意组织起来，为了长期互助下去，作到互不沾光吃亏，提高生产情绪，巩固互助组，又作了具体研究明确计工，他们计工办法是：一天算五个工（早晨一个、上午下午各两个）每工一斤米，半劳力者也算整工（因年老不少作活）牲口顶双工，当时又公选李书田为组长，会后他们积极的进行了互助锄苗，现秋苗已锄完三遍，二遍晚苗也锄完。他们生产情绪很高，都觉得很痛快，半病子的军属吴玉庚常对人说：“我参加互助不但地里多收，还能多活几年哩，每顿饭比先前多吃一个窝窝。”群众们更为感激，纷纷传说：“咱们照顾军属是应当的，军属辞退劳力优军，总觉过意不去，虽说军属辞退了，我们更应关心照顾，有大活都自觉的去帮助。”自此，军属与群众间的关系更密切了，在这次抢种抢锄选模中，军属组荣获冠军，李书田荣获“生产模范”称号。（清河小报）
