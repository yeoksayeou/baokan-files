(Via radio from Jinnan on the 8th) In Xin County, Qi County, Daming County, and Feixiang County, over 1,400 wells were dug in less than a month, turning over 14,000 mu of dry land into paddy fields. Qi County has even put forward the slogan "Every family should have a well" and continues to promote the well-digging movement. In Cixian County's competition of "one well for every three mu of land," Da Guo village alone dug nine wells in twelve days. In Daming County's crash program to rush-plant 50,000 mu of late crops, nearly 400 wells have been dug. This kind of well-digging and production-increasing movement is spreading to counties in the Third District that have suffered from insufficient rainfall since the beginning of spring.

(Another telegram) Feixiang's Tiantaishan Village has won the title of "Well-Digging Banner," as the village ensures that well-digging, weeding, and re-examination are not neglected. When there was a lack of well bricks for well-digging, they re-examined and settled accounts with the landlords, recovering many wall bricks and nearly one million yuan in blood and sweat money, solving the difficulty of well-digging. They organized elderly men and women and semi-laborers to weed the land, and male laborers took half a day off from well-digging to rush-weed the land, and the late crops have been weeded once over.

(Xinhua News Agency, Anyang) The entire county established a water conservancy association to manage water resources and develop water conservancy to combat drought. Since its establishment on June 5th, over 45 days to July 22nd, water conservancy associations have been established on every channel, and a campaign was launched to rush-irrigate and plant, eliminating water-scarce land. All water land has been planted, and 21 branch canals have been opened, capable of irrigating more than 17,000 mu of land.

(Xinhua News Agency, Jin Sui, 5th) The Hongdong-Zhaocheng Democratic Government is assisting the masses in repairing the Tongli Great Canal. 108,000 mu of farmland along the canal will regain irrigation and become fertile land. It is estimated that the yield per mu can be increased from one dan to six dan, and the total output can be increased by more than 500,000 dan. It is expected to be completed in the short term. The canal is located on the west bank of the Fen River, starting from Zhaocheng in the north, passing through Hongdong, and reaching the border of Linfen. During the Japanese occupation, it was washed away by floods due to disrepair. Later, Yan Xishan's "soldier-peasant integration" tyranny forced the residents to flee. When the Chiang army was entrenched in the area, the landlords and gentry organized a water conservancy committee and defrauded the UNRRA of 47,000 dan of wheat. No work was done, and all the funds were embezzled for personal gain. It is reported that the Yan army frequently came to harass during this repair, but they were driven back by the local soldiers and civilians.

    企之大名等县
    一月打井千余眼
    万亩旱地成水田
    【本报冀南八日电】莘县、企之、大名、肥乡四县，不及一月打了一千四百余眼井，一万四千余亩旱地变成水田。企之县并提出“家家有眼井”的口号，继续开展打井运动。成磁县在“每三亩地一眼井”的竞赛中，仅大郭一村，十二天即打起九眼井。大名县突击抢种五万亩晚苗中，凿成近四百眼井。此种打井增产运动，正普及于交春以来雨量不足的三分区各县。
    【又电】肥乡天台山荣获“打井旗帜”的称号，该村打井、锄苗、复查三不误。打井时缺乏井砖，即向地主复查清算，索回许多墙砖及近百万元血汗钱，解决打井困难。组织老汉妇女半辅劳力上地锄苗，男劳力打井时抽半天时间上地，突击锄苗，晚苗已统锄过一遍。
    【本报安阳讯】全县成立水利会，专管水地及开设水利以与旱荒斗争，自六月五号成立后，到七月二十二日共四十五天，将每道渠上成立了水利会，进行了输道突击浇地下种，消灭了水荒地，所有水地都下了种，并开了二十一道支渠，能浇一万七千多亩地。
    【新华社晋绥五日电】洪（洞）赵（城）民主政府协助群众修复通利大水渠，沿渠十万八千亩耕地将重获灌溉而成良田，预计每亩产量可由一石激增至六石，总产量可增加五十余万石，预计短期内即可竣工，该渠位于汾河西岸，北起赵城经洪洞达临汾边境，在日寇占领时期因失修为洪水冲塌。其后阎锡山之“兵农合一”暴政复将居民迫走。蒋军盘踞该地时曾由地主豪绅组织水利委员会，从联总骗取麦子四万七千石，一工未动全部粮款皆被侵吞私饱。闻此次抢修中阎军不时来扰，均经当地军民敌退。
