　　Supporting Large-Scale Production Everywhere
  　Shahe Credit Cooperative Achieves Unprecedented Development
    [Report from our correspondent team on the 11th] Credit cooperatives have become a powerful assistant to the people of Shahe in production and overcoming hardship. The credit cooperative strongly supports agricultural production, and the credit cooperative itself has gained widespread support from the masses and achieved unprecedented development. According to comrades from the Shahe branch of the Jinnan Bank: In the process of production and overcoming hardship, the leadership pointed out: no one should be idle, no money should be idle, and a large number of credit cooperatives should be established. Those with idle money should deposit it in the credit cooperative, and those with labor should borrow from the credit cooperative for production. The credit cooperative is closely linked to production. According to statistics from seven villages including Cejing, in the past two months, the masses have profited 25.63 million yuan from transportation using funds from the credit cooperative, bought back 21 mules, 40 cattle, 137 donkeys, 114 sheep, and 50 pigs, directly supporting agricultural production. During exchanges, the credit cooperative manufactured waterwheels and other water conservancy tools and distributed them to farmers on a "buy if you have money, borrow if you don't" basis. Three villages, including Zhangba, Changcun, and Xiaotunqiao, added and repaired 57 waterwheels, enabling Zhangba Village to irrigate an additional 1.5 hectares of land per day, Changcun Village to irrigate an additional 4 hectares per day, and one well in Xiaotunqiao to increase its daily irrigation area from 0.2 hectares to 0.1 hectares. During the 100-day textile campaign, credit cooperatives universally rushed to make tools and issue loans. In Beizhang Village alone, 15 new looms and 75 spinning wheels were added with the help of the credit cooperative. Women in 23 villages, including Luoyang, borrowed money from the credit cooperative to spin cotton, earning 120,000 yuan and 100,000 catties of millet per month. Because of its dedicated service to the masses, the credit cooperative has gained widespread support from the masses and expanded several times. This spring, only 16 villages in the county had credit cooperatives. Now, they have expanded to 120 villages (more than two-fifths of the 284 villages in the county, slightly less than one-half of the 256 village cooperatives), absorbing 133.55 million yuan of idle funds from the masses. The business of the credit cooperative is also gradually improving. To facilitate farmers' shareholding, it has been proposed that "anything you don't need can be invested in the credit cooperative." Therefore, bachelors put in women's clothes, peasants who have turned over put in the coffin boards they were allocated, uneatable food, and teachers put in their surplus grain allowances, all into the credit cooperative. The credit cooperative satisfies the needs of the masses by "buying if you have money, lending if you don't." The organization of the credit cooperative was initially independent. To better integrate with production, it has now become part of a mixed business and cooperative. (Lin Ming)

　　处处扶植大生产
  　沙河信用社空前发展
    【本报记者团十一日电】信用合作社已成为沙河人民生产渡荒的有力助手。信用社强有力的支持农民生产，信用社自身也获得群众广泛的拥护，得到空前发展。据冀南银行沙河支行的同志谈：在生产渡荒中，领导上指出：人无闲人，钱无闲钱，大量成立信用社，有闲钱的，往信用社存钱，有劳力的去信用社贷款生产，信用社紧紧的和生产结合起来。据册井等七个村统计，群众两个月来，从信用社现款进行运输，已获利二千五百六十三万元，买回骡子二十一头，牛四十头，驴一百卅七头，羊一百一十四只，猪五十只，直接扶植了农业生产，在交换时，信用社制造水车辘辘等水利工具，以“有钱买，无钱贷”的形式，发放给农民。丈八、常村、小屯桥等三村即增添与修理水车五十七辆，使丈八村一天多浇地一顷五十亩，常村每天多浇地六十亩，小屯桥一眼井由日浇三分地，增至一亩半。在百日纺织运动中，信用社普遍的赶制工具，发放贷款，仅北掌一村，即靠信用社新增布机十五架，加速轮纺车七十五辆。洛阳等廿三个村的妇女，从信用社贷款纺花，每月获利十二万元，又十万斤小米。信用社因忠心服务群众，获得群众普遍的拥护，自身也扩大了数个，今春全县只十六个村有信用社，现已扩展到一百二十个村（占全县二百八十四村庄的五分之二强，占二百五十六个村合作社的二分之一弱），共吸收群众游资一万万三千三百五十五万元。信用社的业务，亦逐渐改进，为便于农民入股，提出：“凡用不着的东西，都可入信用社”，因此，光棍汉把女人的衣服，翻身农民把分下的棺材板，吃不着的粮食，教员们把节余的津贴米，统统入了信用社，群众所需要的，信用社又以“有钱买没钱贷”的方法，来满足群众需求。信用社的组织，最初是单独的，为便于和生产更好的结合，现已变成混合业与合作社的一部分。（林明）
