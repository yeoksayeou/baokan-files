    A Certain Unit of Our Army Stationed in Chengwu
    Clears Out Hidden Landlords, Turns Them Over to the People for Handling

    [Report from this newspaper] A certain unit of the People's Liberation Army stationed in Chengwu, Jiluyu Military Region, in order to cooperate with the local masses' land reform re-examination movement, has severely punished landlords and saboteurs who hid in the army and took the opportunity to oppose the peasants' re-examination. This has won the enthusiastic praise of the masses. Earlier this month, Chen Guangsong, a soldier of the unit, was a bankrupt landlord from Houchenlou, Zhangbiao District, Chengwu. Several months ago, he joined the army under the guise of enlisting. This time, after the masses in Houchenlou Village launched a re-examination, Chen led another soldier back to his home without authorization, tied up the chairman of the farmers' association, and threatened him for money, eventually extorting twenty-four silver dollars and six thousand yuan of Luxi currency. Then, they released three landlords detained by the villagers and took them to the army. This immediately aroused the public outrage of the peasants in the whole village. After hearing the news, the unit immediately sent Chen Guangsong and the three landlords back to their original village, and at a mass meeting of the entire village on the 8th, handed Chen Guangsong over to the people for public trial. This incident powerfully encouraged the emancipated masses, and from then on, the re-examination movement in the village developed more rapidly.
