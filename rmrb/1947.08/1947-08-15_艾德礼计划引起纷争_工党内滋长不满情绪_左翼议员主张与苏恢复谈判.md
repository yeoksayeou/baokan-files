Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, August 10th: London dispatch: After the announcement of the Attlee Plan, although a majority of members of the British Parliament expressed their approval, voices of dissatisfaction continue to be heard. During the House of Commons debates on the 6th and 7th, despite continuous explanations from Attlee and Chancellor of the Exchequer Dalton, "dissatisfaction within the Labour Party is still growing" (Agence France-Presse, July 7th). During his criticism of the Attlee Plan on the 7th, Labour Party left-wing member Zilliacus stated: "The government should resume commercial negotiations with the Soviet Union and obtain Soviet wheat; this could immediately lower prices in Britain." Based on parliamentary speeches, the dissatisfaction of left-wing members is mainly concentrated on two points: (1) The financial burden mainly falls on the poor working class; before the government plan was announced, trade unions had agreed to extend working hours on the condition that the government simultaneously levy a capital tax. However, after this news spread, the Labour Party authorities succumbed to the pressure of the Confederation of Employers and hurriedly denied on the 3rd that the government had any such intention. (2) The reduction of the army is too small; over one hundred Labour Party members who are veterans believe that the military reductions announced in the Attlee Plan, drafted by four important cabinet members, Bevin, Dalton, Morrison, and Cripps, are "insufficient to compensate for the sacrifices imposed on the British people." On the Conservative Party side, former Colonial Secretary Stanley and former Foreign Secretary Eden delivered speeches, making some perfunctory criticisms of the Attlee Plan. Besides expressing dissatisfaction with the loss of one-sixth of capitalist investment due to inflation, they generally supported the Labour Party authorities' measures to have the working class mainly bear the heavy burden of saving Great Britain.

　　艾德礼计划引起纷争
    工党内滋长不满情绪
  　左翼议员主张与苏恢复谈判
    【新华社陕北十日电】伦敦讯：艾德礼计划宣布后，英国议会中虽有多数议员表示赞同，但不满之声仍不绝于耳。在六、七两日下院辩论中，尽管艾德礼及财长达尔顿作不断的解释，“工党内不满的情绪仍在生长中”（法新闻社七日电）。工党左翼议员齐里亚库斯于七日批评艾德礼计划时称：“政府应恢复与苏联的商业谈判及获取苏联小麦，这些能够立即使英国物价跌落。”综合议会发言，左翼议员之不满主要集中两点：（一）财政负担主要加在穷苦的工人阶级身上；在政府计划未宣布前，工会曾以政府同时征收资本税为条件答应延长工作时间。但在此项消息传出后，工党当局屈服于雇主联合会的压力，于三日赶忙否认政府曾有此企图。（二）军队之裁减太少；一百余名退伍军人的工党议员认为，由贝文、达尔顿、摩里逊及克利浦斯等四重要阁员所起草的艾德礼计划，其所宣布的军队减缩，是“不足以弥补加诸英国人民身上的牺牲”。保守党方面，曾由前殖民大臣斯坦莱及前外相艾登发表演说，对艾德礼计划除作了一些隔靴搔痒的批评，并表示不满于由通货膨胀而引起资本家投资损失六分之一以外，对工党当局主要由工人阶级肩负重荷以拯救大不列颠的措施，咸表支持。
