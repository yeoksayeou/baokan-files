  　Militia Hero Lin Xinghai

    “Militia hero Lin Xinghai, carries two hand grenades, always participates in battles, always comes in times of crisis.” This is the most popular folk song in the Hai'an and Taixian area of Subei, praising Lin Dagezi (Big Lin). He was a famous artilleryman as early as the Anti-Japanese War period, and now he is the militia captain of a certain township. In the past seven months, he has captured and killed more than sixty Chiang soldiers. He is called Lin Dagezi not only because of his tall stature and extraordinary strength, but also because it contains praise for his great courage and wisdom.

    Once, the Jiangnan Guerrilla force encountered several times its own number of Chiang Kai-shek and puppet troops in Linjiadang. When the battle became tense, Lin Dagezi received the news and quickly led his team to support. He caught sight of a beautiful machine gun on the enemy's position, with two boxes of ammunition next to it, firing at us. After thinking for a moment, he decided to take it down. In the blink of an eye, he went around to the enemy's rear. Taking them by surprise, he picked up two boxes of ammunition and ran. By the time the enemy turned their machine gun to fire at him, there was no ammunition left. At this time, the guerrilla force on the front launched a fierce assault and seized the machine gun, allowing the previously disadvantaged guerrilla force to win a complete victory.

    On another occasion, Chiang's "Self-Defense Force" was severely attacked on the Jiangyan-Zhangdian highway and fled in embarrassment. Suddenly, Lin Dagezi jumped out, with two hand grenades in his hand, and pounced on the Chiang and puppet troops, grabbing the head of Chiang's self-defense regiment, Qian Muxi, and pressing him to the ground, killing him with the hand grenade head and seizing a fast-slow machine gun.

    He once led the militia team and burned down the bridges on the Jiangyan West Street highway four times, making it impossible for the Jiangyan-Zhangdian highway, which Chiang's army had desperately built for more than four months, to be opened to traffic. What frightened Chiang's army the most was the night attack on Jiangyan Town on February 28. When he led twenty-eight elite militiamen into the street, the enemy was still in the dark. Lin Dagezi rushed into Chiang's township office, where a group of bad guys were gambling wildly. Lin Dagezi waved his pistol and shouted, "Don't move!" All personnel below Chiang's township chief surrendered. The militia suggested: "Let's take the prisoners back." Dagezi said, "Wait, there is still a business to be done." After saying that, he crossed the high wall and broke into the residence of Chiang's "Pacification Director" in Jiangyan, and dragged the "Director" out.

    The news spread quickly and caused a sensation throughout Jiangyan Town. The citizens marveled at the bravery of the people's armed forces. But it frightened the Chiang's lackeys who had escaped. They disappointedly complained to each other: "What kind of pacification is this? Lin Dagezi is here to clear the streets."

  　民兵英雄林兴海
    戢濡
    “民兵英雄林兴海，身捎两个手榴弹，每次打仗都有份，危急之时他必来。”这是苏中海（安）泰（县）地区人民歌颂林大个子民谣中最流行的一首。他早在抗日时期就是一个有名的炮手，现在是某乡的民兵队长。七个月来被他活捉和击毙的蒋军已有六十多名。他被称为林大个子，不只是因为他身材高大，力气过人，更含有赞佩他的大勇大智之意。
    一次，姜南游击队在林家荡遭遇到数倍于己的蒋伪军，战斗吃紧之际，林大个子得讯，连忙率队赶援，他瞥见敌人阵地有一挺漂亮的机枪，旁边放着两箱子弹，正在向我们扫射。他想了一想，决定把它拿下来。转眼间他绕到了敌人的后面，乘其不备，扛起两箱子弹就跑，待敌人掉转机枪打他时，已经没有子弹了。这时正面游击队一个猛冲，把机枪缴了过来。使原来处于劣势的游击队缴获全胜。
    又一次蒋记“自卫队”在姜（堰）张（甸）公路上遭我痛击狼狈逃窜，忽然跳出个林大个子，手里拿两个手榴弹，向蒋伪猛扑过去，将蒋记自卫团长钱牧喜揪住按在地上，用手榴弹头将其击毙，夺获一支快慢机。
    他曾领导民兵队，四次烧毁姜堰西街公路上的桥梁。使蒋军拚命修筑四个多月的姜（堰）张（甸）公路不能通车。最使蒋军吓破心胆的，是二月二十八日的夜袭姜堰镇。当他带了二十八个精悍民兵进入大街时，敌人还闷在鼓里。林大个子冲进蒋记乡公所时，那一群坏家伙正在狂赌。林大个子把手枪一挥，叫声“不准动”！蒋记乡长以下全部人员俯首就擒。民兵提议：“带着俘虏回去吧。”大个子说：“且慢，还有一笔生意好做。”说罢，他就越过高墙，突入姜堰蒋记“清乡主任”的住所，把那位“主任”抓了出来。
    消息很快传开了，轰动了整个姜堰镇。市民们惊叹着人民武装的神勇。但却吓坏了漏网的蒋记喽罗们，他们失望地互相埋怨：“还清什么乡，林大个子倒来清街了。”
