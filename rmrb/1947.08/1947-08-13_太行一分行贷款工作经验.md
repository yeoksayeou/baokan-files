　　Loan Work Experience of Taihang First Branch
　　Shuang Qing, Yun Ting

　　I. The Mass Line Loan Method

　　The loan work of Taihang First Branch this year is an improvement based on accepting mass criticisms and past loan experiences. In terms of loan methods, first, all levels jointly study and arrange the work. Especially when the district distributes the loans to the villages, it generally convenes a meeting of village cadres to let them discuss how to make loans, which villages should be loaned, which villages should not be loaned, and how much each should be loaned. For example, in the loan discussion in Shahe, it was proposed that "farmers all over the world are one family, and the poorest villages should be lent to first." The implementation in the villages involved organized evaluation. Who should be loaned to and how much should be loaned were all decided by mass discussion. Only in this way can the correctness of the purpose and object of the loan be guaranteed, changing the past practice of the bank subjectively determining the loan.

　　Regarding accepting mass opinions, in the past, the masses reflected that: first, "the procedures are too troublesome"; second, "the loan is rigid and cannot be repaid until it is due"; third, "the subject limits the loan", for example, if the masses clearly need agricultural loans, but if they have textiles, they cannot get loans. Based on these opinions of the masses, loan name lists were printed and the practice of "sending to those far away and coming to those nearby" was implemented. That is, for places far from the bank, the bank would distribute the loans to the district or base points, and those nearby could come to the bank to borrow, thus saving the masses a lot of time and trouble. Based on the second opinion, the practice of lending in whole and repaying in installments was implemented, with no time limit, and repayment could be made whenever possible. Regarding the third opinion, we changed the rigid subject restrictions. Judging from the experience of this year's loans, the opinions of the masses are completely correct. Only by receiving their opinions can we guarantee that our 230 million yuan loans will play their due role.

　　II. Inspection of the Role of Loans

　　This year's loan work has not only supported large-scale production, but also achieved "funds not leaving the village," "lending as soon as it is recovered," and "lending in whole and repaying in installments," accelerating the speed of turnover, and combining with the huge amount of idle funds of the masses. Especially after the emancipation, the loan credit has greatly improved. From the inspection, it can be seen that more than 90% of this year's loans are correct due to large-scale production. For example: (1) In terms of loan objects, according to the statistics of four districts in Gaoyi, 9.46 million yuan was loaned, and the emancipated masses borrowed more than 7.5 million yuan, accounting for 80% of the total loans, and the number of loan households accounted for 61%. (2) In terms of the role of loans, according to incomplete statistics from four districts in Gaoyi, 75% of the loans were used to solve the difficulties of animal power, and a total of 423 heads of livestock were added; secondly, it supported textile transportation. (3) In textiles, in order to support the "100-day textile transportation campaign," 20 million yuan was loaned, and iron and wood factories were organized through loans. Especially when textile transportation was in full swing, the markets were crowded with native cloth, which could not be sold, and the price fell, making textile women unprofitable. At this time, in addition to government support, the bank also extracted 20 million yuan, through the cooperative headquarters, to support the native cloth market (mainly in Zancheng Neiqiu Guanzhuang), maintaining the smooth sale of native cloth in the market and preventing the price from falling. (4) In uniting idle funds, according to the statistics of five districts in Gaoyi, a total of 6.63 million yuan was loaned, uniting 28.915 million yuan of idle funds from the masses, accounting for more than 270% of the loan amount. According to the statistics of eleven districts in Xingtai, 45.37 million yuan of idle funds from the masses were united, truly making the loans play a supporting role. The above examples illustrate that loan work is not only about releasing the funds, but more importantly, how to strengthen its organizational work and serve large-scale production better and more favorably. Only in this way can the role of loans be greater.

　　III. How to Overcome the Contradiction Between Few Loans and Many Needs of the Masses

　　Due to the enemy's years of rule and destruction and years of natural disasters, the economic strength of the masses has been greatly damaged, and there are many difficulties in production. Therefore, it is impossible to meet the needs of the masses by relying solely on the limited loans. According to experience, there are three solutions: (1) "Organize the masses' own strength to solve the masses' own difficulties." Universally carrying out rural credit work is the best solution. Since the trial of rural credit work last year, this has been proven. For example, the Shahe branch has established 79 credit departments (based on cooperatives) in one year of efforts, and the credit funds have reached more than 44.9 million yuan, exceeding the total loan amount of the bank. In more than 40 credit departments in Zanhuang, the funds and deposits have reached more than 8 million yuan. In particular, the Zaolin credit department has achieved "loans available whenever needed," solving all the production difficulties of the masses. In order to support cooperatives in carrying out credit business, the bank has successively transferred loans to cooperatives. Zanhuang has transferred 17.66 million yuan of loans to cooperatives for distribution in 121 villages. For example, there are a total of 23 cooperatives in the first district of Gaoyi, most of which were established with loan assistance. After this year's supplementary loan measures through cooperatives, 19 cooperatives have now carried out credit business. According to statistics, a total of 1,670 jin of cotton, 3,800 jin of cotton seeds, and 2.449 million yuan in cash have been loaned out, and the bank has transferred 1.29 million yuan of loans, totaling (including the price of cotton seeds) 5.364 million yuan, loaned to 887 households. (2) Distribute loans early so that the masses can engage in some sideline production during the slack farming season, so as to solve the greater difficulties in spring plowing, so as to maximize the role of a small number of loans. (3) When issuing loans, try to organize and combine them with the idle funds of the masses, instead of using loans to replace the funds of the masses, so that loans can truly play a supporting role.

　　太行一分行贷款工作经验
    双庆　云亭
　　一、群众路线的贷款方法
    太行一分行今年的贷款工作，是接受群众批评意见及历年来的贷款经验而改进的。贷款方法上，首先由各级共同研究与布置，特别由区向村分配时，一般是召开村干部会议，让他们进行讨论，如何贷，那村该贷，那村不该贷，谁该贷多少由他们来决定。如在沙河的贷款讨论中，即提出天下农民是一家，先尽最贫的村贷等。到村实行了有组织的评议，贷给谁，贷多少，都由群众讨论决定，只有这样才能保证贷款的用途和对象的正确，改变了过去银行主观确定贷款的作法。
    在接受群众意见上，过去群众反映说：贷款第一“手续太麻烦”；第二、是“贷款死板不到期不能还”；第三“科目限制了贷款”，如群众明明需要的是农业贷款，可是有纺织就不能贷等。根据群众这些意见，印发了贷款花名单，并实行了“远送近来”的作法，即离银行远的地方，由银行到区或基点发放，近的可到银行贷，这样就节省了群众好多时间和麻烦。根据第二个意见，实行了整贷零还，不限时间，有了就可还。对第三个意见，我们改变了死板的科目限制。从今年贷款的经验上看，群众的意见是完全正确的，只有接收他们的意见，才能保证了我们二万万三千万元的贷款起到应有的作用。
　　二、贷款的作用检查
    今年的贷款工作，不仅扶持了大生产，并作到了“款不离村”“随收随贷”，“整贷零还”，加速了周转的速度，结合了群众巨大游资，特别经过翻身后，贷款信用大大提高了，从检查当中，可以看出，今年的贷款百分之九十以上都是正确的由于大生产。例如：（一）在贷款的对象上，据高邑四个区的统计，贷款九百四十六万元，翻身群众即贷到七百五十多万元，占贷款总数的百分之八十，贷款户占百分之六十一。（二）贷款的作用上，据高邑四个区不完全统计，百分之七十五的贷款用以解决畜力困难，共增加了四百二十三头牲口；其次扶持了纺运。（三）在纺织上，为了扶持百日纺运，贷款二千万元，通过贷款组织铁、木工厂等。尤其在纺运正开展的时候，各市场土布拥挤，销售不了，且价格下落，使纺织妇无利，这时除政府扶助外，银行又抽出了二千万元，通过合作总社，扶持土布市场（以赞城内邱官庄为主），保持市场土布之畅销及价格不落。（四）在团结游资上，如高邑五个区的统计，总共贷款六百六十三万元，团结群众游资二千八百九十一万五千元，占贷款数的百分之二百七十多。邢台十一个区的统计，团结了群众游资四千五百三十七万元，真正使贷款起了扶持作用。从以上几个例子说明贷款工作，不仅是将款放出完事，更重要的是如何加强它的组织工作，更好更有利的服务于大生产，只有这样贷款的作用才会更大。
　　三、如何克服贷款少群众需要多的矛盾
    由于敌人几年来的统治摧残和连年灾荒，群众经济力量受到很大破坏，生产当中的困难很多。因此单依有数的贷款是不可能满足群众要求的。根据经验，现有三个解决办法：（一）“组织群众自己力量，解决群众自己困难”。普遍开展农村信用工作是最好的解决办法，自从去年试办农村信用工作以来，已证明了这一点。例如沙河支行在一年的努力中，已建立了七十九个信用部（在合作社基础上），信用资金即有四千四百九十余万元，超过了银行全部贷款数。赞皇在四十多个信用部里，资金和存款已达八百余万元，特别是枣林信用部作到了“啥时贷款啥时有款”，解决群众全部生产困难。为了扶持合作社开展信用业务，银行先后将贷款转给了合作社，赞皇已将一百二十一个村一千七百六十六万元贷款转给合作社发放。如高邑一区全区共二十三个合作社，大部是在贷款扶助下建立起来的，经过今年通过合作社补贷的措施，现已有十九个合作社开展了信用业务，据统计，共贷出棉花一千六百七十斤，棉籽三千八百斤，贷出现款二百四十四万九千元，银行转贷一百二十九万元，共计（棉籽折价在内）五百三十六万四千元，贷给了八百八十七户。（二）提早发放贷款，使群众在农闲时搞些副业生产，以资解决春耕当中的更大困难，以求少数贷款起到的作用。（三）在发放贷款时，尽量组织结合群众游资，不是贷款代替群众资金，使贷款真正起到扶持作用。
