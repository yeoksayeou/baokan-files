　　Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, August 21st: Reports from various sources indicate that the United States, under the guise of "aid," is intensifying its military and economic expansion into Italy. On the one hand, the U.S. State Department announced on the 14th that the U.S. government had decided to "abandon" its claims for reparations from Italy, amounting to approximately 1 billion yuan, and to return 13 Italian warships seized during the war. On the other hand, in addition to the U.S. announcing that its troops would remain in Italy until February of next year, even after the ratification of the peace treaty with Italy, the U.S. Mediterranean Fleet recently gathered numerous ships at the ports of Grande-Île and Maddalena, at the northern tip of Sardinia, to conduct "exercises" and "survey ocean currents." According to Italian newspapers, the important base of Maddalena will secretly fall into the hands of the United States. Simultaneously, following a meeting of the Commander of U.S. Forces in Europe in Livorno, Italy, the Commander of U.S. Forces in Italy informed the Italian government that "the United States will grant Italy a loan, on the condition that Livorno is ceded to the United States as a naval base." American oil merchants are also conducting large-scale oil exploration in the provinces of the Po River basin in northern Italy. Major Paul Bollew, formerly in charge of "oil issues" in the U.S. Fifth Army, has recently removed his army uniform and hung up a sign at his residence reading "New Jersey Standard Oil Company Branch." He recently told a reporter from the New York Herald Tribune that the company "hopes to obtain exclusive rights to exploit oil in the Po River basin." He also stated, "If large oil deposits are discovered in the basin, the company is prepared to spend unlimited funds to develop them."

　　美国想霸占地中海加紧向意大利扩张
    【新华社陕北二十一日电】各方讯：美国在“援助”招牌下，加紧向意大利实行军事及经济扩张。一方面美国务院十四日宣布美政府决定“放弃”对意国之赔偿要求约十亿万元，并发还战时卤获意国的舰船一十三艘。另一方面除了美国在对意和约批准后仍宣布其驻军将继续留至明年二月外，美地中海舰队最近结集舰船多只于大兰多港及撒丁北端的马达伦纳港，举行“演习”和“勘测海流”。据意大利报纸消息，重要基地马达伦纳将秘密落入美国之手。同时，驻欧美军司令在意境里窝那举行会议后，驻意军司令即通知意政府称：“美国将予意以贷款，而以里窝那议与美国作海军基地为条件。”美国油商则正在意北部波河流域各省进行大规模的石油勘测。前在美第五军中掌管“石油问题”的鲍刘格少校最近已脱下陆军制服，在住所挂起“新泽西美孚油公司分行”的招牌。他最近对纽约先驱论坛报记者说：该公司“希望在波河流域开采石油方面，获有专利权。”又称：“如果在该流域发现大油床，该公司准备支用无限款项加以开采。”
