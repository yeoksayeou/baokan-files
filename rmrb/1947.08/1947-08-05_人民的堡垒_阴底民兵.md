    People's Fortress
    Yin Di Militia
    Lang Qiao
    "The village may seem small, the population may seem few, but they immediately grab their weapons." The Chiang-Yan troops, regiment after regiment, always let out such laments after suffering losses at the hands of the Yin Di militia.
    Yin Di is only a little over ten li away from the enemy strongholds of Huoxian County, Putan, Guozhuang, and Xinfa Station. The Yin Di militia's outpost, Duanzhuang, is only two li away from the enemy, constantly under fire from the enemy's pillbox. In order to eliminate this people's fortress, the Chiang-Yan troops often concentrated forces of over a thousand men to carry out sneak attacks, encirclements, or wide-frontal assaults. From last year until the Huoxian enemy fled in April of this year, the enemy fought the Yin Di militia a total of one hundred and thirty-one times, injuring only one militiaman in total, while the enemy suffered one hundred and fifty-one casualties below the rank of battalion and company commander, and twenty captured platoon leaders. They seized one mortar, one small cannon, two light machine guns, two grenade launchers, and more than twenty rifles and six pistols. The brave and tenacious militiamen of Yin Di Duanzhuang Joint Defense, for more than a year, never let go of their guns, never took off their clothes at night, completely and victoriously protecting the lives and property of the people, carrying out land reform, and never retreated a single step under any adverse circumstances.
    In 1943, a few brave and loyal young peasants in Yin Di Village, led by Zhu Shuangxi, captured four puppet soldiers and four rifles with their bare hands. They immediately armed themselves and defeated the maintenance society in the village. Since then, Yin Di Village has always belonged to the people. Zhu Shuangxi cultivated a younger Zhang Yinba in Duanzhuang, a resourceful and brave militiaman with a kind personality. Under the influence of Zhu Shuangxi, Zhang Yinba, and victory, the number of militia and weapons in this area gradually developed at an alarming rate, and more than twenty combat heroes emerged, victoriously persisting in and expanding the people's阵地阵地. We do not rely on "regular troops," and we do not ask superiors for guns, cannons, or bullets! This is a true and bold statement in the Yin Di militia's song.
    On October 15th of last year, the day the Hu Zongnan troops invaded northward in large numbers, Zhang Yinba led several brave militiamen to attack small groups of Chiang troops twice in one day on the Pingpu Railway. Once, they crossed the railway directly, chasing to the Fen River, and captured the enemy. This news shocked the people who were fleeing to the mountainous areas, and everyone knew that the Chiang-Hu troops were not to be feared. Many militiamen immediately turned back to persist in the struggle. Later, they also defeated the enemy's entire regiment's encirclement and attack. In particular, on April 4th of this year, the Yan troops' 206th and 207th regiments launched an attack on Yin Di in four routes. First, they detonated the militia's signal mine on Shangcao Plateau. The Yin Di masses safely evacuated upon hearing the sound. The enemy spent three hours before entering the empty and calm village, starting to set up pots and cook. However, the evacuated militia quietly returned along the transportation trenches and arranged their firepower on the edge of the village. At this time, the enemy's sentry stepped on a landmine. The enemy in the village rushed out to see what was happening and were hit by a fierce barrage of bullets from the militia, falling in disarray. The landmines in various places were also detonated by the panicked enemy, and explosions rang out everywhere. The enemy quickly collected twelve wounded corpses and retreated back to the stronghold with empty stomachs. Since then, the enemy dared not come out. Zhang Yinba and Zhu Shuangxi automatically started land reform in the village, and the land reform in nearby villages was also carried out with their assistance and armed protection. Moreover, the militia was further developed. The county discovered his work achievements and praised him as a "two-in-one" hero who held a gun in one hand and distributed land in the other, and called on all the county's militia to learn from him.
    In addition to force, the enemy often used bribery to deal with the militia of Yin Di and Duanzhuang. They once sent a special agent to buy off Zhu Shuangxi, but Zhu Shuangxi detained him and handed him over to the masses for disposal. Last summer, the enemy sent a young beauty, disguised as a refugee, who lived in the village for a long time, specializing in selling charms and prostituting herself to the militia. However, none of the militiamen were fooled. The enemy also often fabricated rumors and slandered, saying that the militia were the "troublemakers" of the Yin Di Duanzhuang people. However, these shameless fabrications did not confuse the people at all. On the contrary, they made the masses in various strongholds send more reliable information to the militia. The masses of Yin Di Duanzhuang sincerely comforted the militia during festivals and often asked if the militiamen had enough bullets, just as the old man Zhou Quanli, who voluntarily donated a shi of wheat for the militia to buy bullets, said: "The militia are our lifeline."

    人民的堡垒
    阴底民兵
    朗樵
    “看看村不大，听听人不多，一去就吃家伙”。整团整团的蒋阎军，每次在阴底吃了民兵的亏后，总发出这样的哀鸣。
    阴底西距敌人的据点霍县城、蒲滩、郭庄和辛发车站都不过十里多路，阴底民兵的前哨阵地段庄，仅离敌人二里，常受碉堡上敌人的流弹射击，蒋阎军为消灭这个人民堡垒，经常集中千人以上的兵力，来进行偷袭、包抄、或宽正面的攻击。从去年开始，到今年四月霍县敌人逃窜前，敌人与阴底民兵作战共达一百三十一次，总共只打伤过一个民兵，而敌人却被毙伤营连长以下一百五十一名，俘排长等二十名。缴获迫击炮、小炮各一门，轻机枪两挺，掷弹筒两个，步枪二十余支，手枪六支。英勇顽强的阴底段庄联防的民兵们，一年多以来，手不离枪，夜不解衣、完全胜利的保卫了人民的生命财产，进行土地改革，在任何恶劣情况下，没有后退过一步。
    一九四三年，阴底村以朱双喜为首的几个骁勇而忠实的青年农民，有一次空手俘虏了四个伪军，四条步枪。他们马上就武装起自己，打垮了村中的维持会。此后，阴底村就一直是属于人民的了。朱双喜在段庄培植了一个比他更年轻的张银把，这是一个智勇兼备的民兵，性格和善，在朱双喜、张银把以及胜利的影响下，这一带的民兵和武器的数量，逐渐有了惊人的发展，出现了二十多个战斗英雄，胜利的坚持与扩大了人民的阵地，我们不依靠“正规兵团”不向上级要枪炮子弹！这是阴底民兵歌曲中符合实情的豪语。
    去年十月十五日，胡宗南军大股北犯的那天，张银把带领几个勇敢的民兵，一日两下平蒲铁路，袭击小股蒋军，一次直越过铁路，追直汾河，将敌人捉回。这消息震奋了正往沿山一带逃难的人们，大家知道了蒋胡军并不可怕，有许多民兵立即就又折返回来坚持斗争了。以后又打垮了敌人的整团的包围进攻。特别是今年四月四日，阎军二○六、二○七两个团，分四路又向阴底进攻，先在上曹一塬上踏响了民兵的信号雷，阴底群众闻声安全转移出来，敌人费了三个钟头，才进到空虚冷静的村内，开始安锅做饭，而撤出的民兵，却又顺着交通壕，悄悄地返来在村边上布置好火力，这时，敌人放出的警戒兵，踏响了一颗地雷。村内敌人，慌忙出来瞧看，被民兵一阵猛烈的弹雨，打得东倒西歪，各处的地雷也被慌乱逃跑的敌人踏响，炸声四起，敌人连忙收拾起十二具伤员尸体，饿着肚子退回据点了。从此敌人不敢出来了。张银把和朱双喜自动在村内，搞起土地改革，附近各村的土改，也都在他们的帮助和武装保护下进行了。而且又发展了民兵，县上发现了他的工作成绩，誉他为一手拿枪、一手分田的“两位一体”英雄，并号召全县民兵向他学习。
    除了用武力以外，敌人经常用利诱的办法对付阴底和段庄的民兵。他们曾派过一个特务来收买朱双喜，被朱双喜扣起来交给了群众处理。去年夏天敌人又派来一个年轻美女，装扮成难民，来村住了好久，专向民兵卖俏卖淫。但民兵们没有一个上当的。敌人又经常造谣污蔑，说民兵是阴底段庄老百姓的“惹祸虫。”可是这些无耻的捏造，都丝毫没有迷惑老百姓，反而使各据点内的群众，更多的给民兵送来了可靠的情报。阴底段庄的群众，逢年过节，诚意的慰劳民兵，经常询问民兵们的子弹是否够用，正如自愿捐出一石麦子给民兵买子弹的周全力老汉所说：“民兵是咱的命根子”。
