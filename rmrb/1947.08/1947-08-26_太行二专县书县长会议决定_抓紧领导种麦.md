    The Taihang Second Special District Party Committee and County Head Conference Decides:
  　Seize the Leadership in Wheat Planting
    [This newspaper reports] In order to deepen the production and frugality movement, the Taihang Second Special District convened a conference of county party secretaries and county heads in early August. Everyone unanimously resolved that, in terms of production, in addition to grasping the hoeing of seedlings with more hoeing, fine hoeing, and universally applying top dressing, they should now thoroughly mobilize the masses, actively prepare wheat seeds, fertilizer, and wheat fields. In the autumn wheat planting campaign, efforts should be made to expand wheat fields to increase production. In areas where wheat seeds are insufficient, the public grain can be borrowed to supplement them. In order to expand wheat fields and eliminate cultivated wasteland, the conference also decided that for wasteland that has been barren for more than three years, the masses can be exempt from burdens for three years after planting wheat, and those barren for two years will be exempt for two years. The grain produced will belong entirely to the cultivators. In the gaps in agricultural production, sideline production should also be vigorously developed, and transportation should be developed first, overcoming the mass thinking of "looking down on small profits." In order to facilitate the development of transportation, counties should vigorously repair roads and renovate shops in the autumn to reduce the difficulties for the masses in transportation. All localities should open more coal kilns and export large quantities of coal in exchange for grain and necessities, carry out the "rely on the mountains to eat the mountains, rely on the water to eat the water" movement, organize the export of mountain goods and medicinal materials, and carry out the movements of boiling saltpeter, boiling salt, and boiling alkali. Women should devote themselves to the second 100-day spinning and weaving movement, so that counties can be self-sufficient in clothing, entirely or mostly, by the end of this year. Cooperatives in various places should strive to support agricultural and sideline production. Secondly, counties should vigorously rectify the three-level financial system in August and September, using the mass conscious spirit of "open finance, open difficulties, everyone is in charge, everyone thinks of ideas" to overcome the chaos and waste in finance, and to put county finance on the path of production self-sufficiency and reduce the burden on the people.

　　太行二专县书县长会议决定
  　抓紧领导种麦
    【本报讯】为深入生产节约运动，太行二专区特于本月上旬，召开县书县长会议。大家一致决议：在生产方面，各县除抓紧锄苗多锄、精锄、并普遍上追肥外，现在即应深入动员群众，积极准备麦种，料肥和麦地，秋后种麦运动中要大力扩大麦田，以增加生产。麦种不够的地区，可由公粮借给一部补足之，为了扩大麦田，消灭熟荒，因此会议又决定：凡三年以上的荒地种麦后，群众可以三年不出负担，两年者两年不出负担，所种的粮食完全归耕种者所得，农业生产空隙，副业生产亦应大力开展，首先即应开展运输，克服那种“看不起小利”的群众思想，为便利运输的开展，各县秋后应大力修路，改造店房，以减少群众运输道途上的困难。各地要多开煤窑，大量输出煤炭，以换回粮食和必需品，开展“靠山吃山，靠水吃水”运动，组织山货药材的出口，并开展熬硝、熬盐、熬碱运动，妇女们则应全力开展第二个百日纺织运动，作到今年年底各县穿衣全部或大部自给，各地合作社，则应作到为支持农副业生产而努力。其次各县在八、九月内要大力整顿三级财政，以“公开财政，公开困难，大家当家，大家想法”的群众自觉精神，来克服财政中的混乱与浪费现象，而使县财政走上生产自给，减轻民负。（王力行）
