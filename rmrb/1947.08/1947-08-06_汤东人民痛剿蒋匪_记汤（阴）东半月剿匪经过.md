I. The Achievements of Mobilizing the Masses for Half a Month Are the Capital for Defeating the Chiang Bandits.

Tang (Yin) Dong was a region ruled by the arch-bandit and special agent Si Huasheng of Chiang Kai-shek for more than 30 years. Many landlords had "bandit characteristics"; some started as bandits, and some were landlords who also engaged in banditry. Politically, they were controlled by Chiang Kai-shek, forming a ruling group of bandits, special agents, and landlords, seizing power and establishing bureaus. The peasants suffered cruel exploitation and oppression. After this area was liberated in the Yu-Bei Campaign, under our policy of vigorously supporting and letting go of mass mobilization, 20,000 peasants organized themselves to engage in fierce battles against treacherous bandits and landlords, recovering more than 30,000 mu of land. More than 80 treacherous bandits and landlords were sentenced to death in front of the people, and nearly ××× emancipated peasants shouldered guns to defend their cause of emancipation.

II. Treacherous Bandits and Landlords Conspire to Riot

After the Liu-Deng army went south, Chiang's bandit regiment commander Si Bingnan (Si Huasheng's son) sent back more than 30 plainclothes agents from Anyang, who hid in the blank villages where we had no work, and colluded with local treacherous bandits, special agents, and landlords, spreading rumors that "Liu Bocheng's troops are 300 li away, Si Bingnan is going to bring troops back to Caiyuan, the Eighth Route Army is finished," in order to gather scattered bandits and threaten the masses. At the same time, landlords colluded everywhere, saying, "A few district government workers don't scare them;" and launched a counterattack against the peasants. On June 28th and 29th, seven major tragedies occurred in a row. On the 30th, they occupied Yue'erzhai, Liang'erzhai, and Caiyuan, establishing bandit bases, robbing passers-by, and creating a terrifying situation. We lost four district cadres, four emancipation team members, and 11 village cadres and militiamen. The landlord of Rengu Village threatened to attack the Eighth District government, and Li Gao (bureau leader) of Shuitata River wanted to attack the county government, and attempted a full-scale riot.

III. Boldly Approve the Demands of the Masses and Resolutely Suppress Treacherous Bandits and Landlords.

After the incident, the broad masses reported to us one after another, asking us to eliminate the bandits. The resolute elements in the struggle gathered together, and voluntarily sent their families to the east of the Wei River, and put forward the slogan: "Rather die in battle than starve to death," demanding resolute action. We boldly approved the demands of the masses, and expressed our attitude in front of the masses, vowing to stick to Tangdong, and resolutely lead the people of Tangdong to emancipate themselves. Under this policy, our county and district cadres led the newly emancipated ××× militiamen with guns and the independent battalion and district cadre teams, relying on the broad masses of emancipated peasants, and issued a charge to the enemy!

On the night of July 2nd, our county brigade, the district cadre team of the Sixth District, and the militia, totaling ××× people, attacked Si Huasheng's old lair Yue'erzhai and Liang'erzhai. After two hours of fighting, we annihilated 13 enemies, captured more than 40 enemies, and seized 13 rifles, creating a great momentum and shaking dozens of villages. In order not to give the enemy a chance to breathe, on the night of the 4th, we attacked Caiyuan, annihilating 17 enemies (including one company commander and three squad leaders), and seizing three guns. From then on, the Jiang bandits who gathered shares no longer existed, and the bandit leader Si Zhensheng (Si Huasheng's battalion commander) was scared and fled to Anyang.

The remaining Jiang bandits scattered in various villages. In order to thoroughly eliminate them, we implemented the method of tracking and pursuing and decentralized suppression. The Chen Quanfu militia team carried out guerrilla activities, investigated Rengu Market and Nanqingzhong, arrested 100 treacherous bandits and landlords, and handed over more than 20 big shots to the masses for public trial. The county headquarters and the Sixth and Seventh District militias seized 28 scattered bandits, and seven principal offenders were suppressed according to law.

In total, 135 Chiang bandits were killed or captured, and their property was confiscated and distributed to the masses.

With the victory of bandit suppression, we held meetings in each village we arrived at, expressing our attitude to the masses, explaining that we are determined to lead the peasants to emancipate themselves, fight the Chiang bandits and landlords to the end, and vow not to withdraw from Tangdong, and tell the masses about the favorable situation after the Liu-Deng army went south, strengthening the people's confidence in victory. We called on the people to take bold action to eliminate the Chiang bandits and thoroughly emancipate themselves. Because the masses saw the victory with their own eyes, they all clapped their hands and said, "We did a good job, and we did it right." Not only did they dare to ask for the fruits of victory, but they also scrambled for them. When the enemy organized the Lian Zhuang Hui activity to Yao Hui, the Yao Hui village chief said, "I have become the Eighth Route Army, I will not be fooled by you." He immediately reported to the district government, and was immediately suppressed. The women and old men of Qingzhong carried baskets to the fields to work, or pretended to visit relatives, and scouted the situation everywhere, forming a mass movement to suppress bandits.

IV. Victory in Bandit Suppression, Great Mobilization of the Masses.

Because we let go and approved the demands of the masses to resolutely suppress treacherous bandits and landlords, we promoted a high degree of enthusiasm and creativity. The Chen Quanfu model militia team appeared, the heroes who decisively and bravely fought for the capture of criminal suspects appeared, the model underground workers appeared, and the model masses who scouted and sent messages appeared. A total of 18 county and district cadres, 22 village cadres and militiamen, two underground workers, and more than 10 model masses. They have made contributions in protecting the cause of the masses' emancipation. The county headquarters awarded 50,000 yuan in bonuses, three dozen towels, and three dozen foreign socks to them separately. Everyone said that after this test, they would dare to try it with old Chiang anywhere in China!

The emancipated masses deepened their hatred for the enemy and increased their confidence in victory, and quickly turned to struggle. On the 14th, the masses of Wangling Market detained 17 men and women struggling objects, and 6,000 people gathered together to conduct struggle. Men, women, old and young worked together, and the arrogance of the landlords was beaten to pieces. The masses of Zhenfuzhai voluntarily detained 45 landlord households, and accused them of more than 900 opinions. After Rengu arrested the landlords, the masses said that the time to act has come. More than 1,000 people gathered together and filed 600 opinions. A large-scale emancipation movement is about to unfold.

    汤东人民痛剿蒋匪
    记汤（阴）东半月剿匪经过

    一、月半发动群众成绩，是战胜蒋匪的资本。
    汤（阴）东是巨匪蒋特司华生统治三十余年地区，不少地主带“土匪性”，有的是土匪起家，有的是地主兼营土匪。政治上受蒋介石的支配，形成土匪、特务、地主三位一体的统治集团，掌握政权，设立局子，农民深受残酷的剥削与压迫。豫北战役该地获得解放后，在我有力撑腰放手发动的方针下，两万农民组织起来，向奸匪、地主进行激战，收回土地三万余亩，八十余名奸匪、地主在人民面前判处死刑，近×××个翻身农民扛起枪来，武装保卫自己的翻身事业。
    二、奸匪地主阴谋暴动
    刘、邓大军南下后，蒋匪团长司丙南（司华生儿）从安阳派回三十余名便衣，隐藏在我没有工作的空白村，和当地的奸、特、地主勾结起来，大肆造谣说：“刘伯承队伍离开三百里以外，司丙南要带兵回菜园，八路军不中了”，借以收容散匪，威胁群众。同时地主到处串通说：“单几个区公所工作员不尿他”；向农民实行反扑。六月二十八、二十九两天，一连发生七次较大惨案，三十号就盘踞岳儿寨、梁儿寨、菜园三点，建立了土匪根据地，来往行人被劫夺，造成恐怖局面，我损失区干部四名，翻身队四名，村干部、民兵十一名。任固村地主扬言要打八区公所，水蹋河李高（局子队长）要打县政府，并妄图全面暴动。
    三、大胆批准群众要求，坚决镇压奸匪地主。
    事变发生后，广大群众纷纷给我们通风报信，要我们消灭匪徒。斗争中的坚决分子都集中起来，自动把家属送到卫河东，并提出：“宁叫战死，不叫饿死”的口号，要求坚决干。我们大胆的批准群众要求，并在群众面前表示态度，誓死坚持汤东，坚决领导汤东人民翻身。在这个方针下，我县区干部带领新翻身的×××个扛枪民兵和独立营、区干队扭成一块，依托广大的翻身农民，向敌人发出了冲锋号！
    七月二号夜，我县大队和六区区干队及民兵共×××余人，进袭司华生老＠岳儿寨、梁儿寨，经两小时战斗，歼敌十三名，俘敌四十余名，缴长枪十三枝，声势浩大，震动数十村庄。为不给敌人喘息机会，四号夜，进袭菜园，歼敌十七名（内中队长一名，班长三名），缴枪三枝。从此集股的蒋匪已不存在，匪首司振声（司华生营长）吓得逃往安阳。
    残余蒋匪四散各村，我为彻底消灭，实行跟踪追击，分散清剿的办法。陈全福民兵队游击活动，清查任固集、南青冢，逮捕奸匪、地主一百人，将二十余名大头子，交群众公审。县指挥部与六区、七区民兵查获散匪二十八人，七名主犯依法镇压。
    总计毙俘蒋匪一百三十五名，并没收其财产，分给群众。
    随着剿匪胜利，所到各村召开大会，向群众表示态度，说明我们坚决领导农民翻身，和蒋匪、地主干到底，誓死不退出汤东，并告群众刘、邓大军南下后的有利形势，坚定老百姓胜利信心。号召人民大胆行动起来，消灭蒋匪，彻底翻身。由于群众亲眼看到胜利，都是拍手称快说：“我们这一手干的好，干的对。”分果实不但敢要，而且抢着要。敌人组织联庄会活动到尧会时，尧会村长说：“我已成了八路军，不上你们的当。”马上向区公所报告，即时予以镇压。青冢妇女、老汉携上篮子装去地做活，装串亲戚，四处侦察情况，形成全民剿匪运动。
    四、剿匪胜利，群众大动。
    由于我们放手批准了群众坚决镇压奸匪、地主的要求，发扬了高度的积极性和创造性，陈全福模范民兵队出现了，果断勇敢争夺案犯英雄出现了，地下工作模范出现了，侦察送信的模范群众出现了。计县区干部十八名、村干部、民兵二十二名、地下工作者两名、模范群众十余名。在保卫群众翻身事业上立下了功劳。县指挥部以五万元奖金及毛巾三打，洋袜三打，分别进行奖励。人人都说，经过这次考验，走遍中国都敢和大老蒋试一试！
    翻身群众对敌人的仇恨加深了，胜利信心更提高了，很快地转入斗争。十四号王陵集群众就扣起男女斗争对象十七名，六千群众齐集会，进行斗争。男女老幼一齐干，把地主气焰打得落花流水。镇抚寨群众自动扣起四十五户地主，控诉出九百余条意见。任固逮捕地主后，群众说现在已到干的时候了，一千余群众集会，诉出六百条意见，大规模的翻身运动即将展开。
