　　This Newspaper Holds Ideological Examination Symposium
    All Comrades Resolve to Examine Their Standpoint
  　Experiences Shared by the Literary Federation Bookstore Are Very Illuminating
    [This Newspaper Despatch] In response to Comrade Liao Chengzhi's call to "Examine the standpoint of journalists, examine the 'Kerry-Kong' [克里空] ideology," all comrades of this newspaper are intensively studying in preparation for the upcoming "September 1st" Memorial Day. Since the 20th of last month, all members of the company, under the guidance of the Central Directly Subordinate General Branch's instruction to "Investigate fields, investigate class, investigate ideology," have devoted themselves to this movement. Every comrade has revealed many muddled concepts and non-class thoughts during the land reform movement. However, some obstacles were encountered during the examination movement. Some cadres in the editorial department believed: "My home is not in the liberated area. I grew up in the city and left my landlord family very early, so there are no ideological problems"; some comrades in the management department, although often closely related to landlord families, did not dare to boldly expose themselves, fearing to be labelled as landlords or rich peasants. These thoughts hindered the rapid and in-depth development of the examination movement throughout the company. In the middle of this month, Comrade Yuan Bo returned from attending the Taihang correspondent meeting, reporting the enthusiastic examination of standpoint and 'Kerry-Kong' ideology by the Taihang correspondents, which greatly encouraged and excited the examination movement of all comrades. In particular, Comrade Liao Chengzhi's instructions forcefully criticized the view that one could have a clear anti-Chiang and anti-American stance without a clear stance on landlords, and also pointed out that "exaggerating cultural level" and "technical viewpoints" were reversing priorities, restricting the newspaper from truly serving the people. Therefore, every reporter and editor must face the workers and peasants, and be able to report the real situation of the masses and reflect the real demands of the peasants during interviews. The editing and rewriting of manuscripts should also be a process of absorbing the demands of the masses, and the editing should only focus on how to highlight the demands of the peasants even more prominently. Only in this way can we truly serve the people well. Zhang Panshi, Deputy Director of the Propaganda Department of the Central Bureau, instructed: Every comrade should carefully examine their landlord ideology, and examine facing the workers and peasants, facing this area, and facing reality, all of which are issues of standpoint. 'Kerry-Kong' ideology is also an issue of standpoint. Instability in these areas is all "'Kerry-Kong'"; investigating "'Kerry-Kong'" is investigating these issues. These instructions provided a very clear direction and enlightenment for the self-reflection and examination of every member of the company. Everyone felt that the previous examination was not thorough enough and resolved to improve their thinking in the next examination movement. Based on the requirements and emotions of all comrades in the company, and in order to further promote this examination movement and learn from the experiences of other organizations, the Academic Committee invited Comrades Wang Chun and Zhao Shuli from Xinhua Bookstore, and Huangmei and Ouyang Shan from the Border Region Literary Federation on the 22nd to hold a symposium on ideological examination and learning. Wang Zhongqing, from the Propaganda Department of the Central Bureau, also attended. The bookstore is characterized by having more local cadres, and the land reform movement had a direct impact on them. Comrade Wang Chun introduced their experience: First, let everyone freely talk about their various thoughts on the land reform movement, digging out all kinds of ideological and action-based "air-raid shelters," and then clarify their standpoint. Therefore, one should not immediately begin by studying documents, but must focus on understanding people's thoughts. Secondly, the examination should be more democratic, allowing everyone to expose everything. If criticism is carried out immediately after a little exposure, it will block the entrance to the "air-raid shelter." Comrade Zhao Shuli vividly explained, through the reflective process of a typical comrade in his group, that the resistance to land reform by people from landlord families is not as simple as some comrades think. For example, when the family of a cadre from a landlord background was struggled against by the masses, he wrote in his secret diary: "The crescent moon shines on the nine continents, some families are happy and some are sad; every family eats dumplings during the New Year, only my family sheds tears." However, since feudalism is being squeezed out everywhere, these "air-raid shelters" cannot be hidden anywhere, and the only way is to thoroughly liquidate them. Comrade Huangmei introduced the examination and learning situation of the Literary Federation. Most of the people in their organization are urban intellectuals, so everyone emphasized the glorious history of moving towards the revolution. Their experience is to first emphasize solving problems ideologically. Every comrade should regard themselves as a cadre of the Party, and start by improving themselves ideologically and in their work, and sincerely and frankly examine themselves. Secondly, it is emphasized that everyone should dare to expose themselves from a class standpoint and boldly conduct examinations using class analysis methods. As a result of this examination, everyone suddenly realized that their relationship with the revolution was very weak, because they participated due to various opportunities or accepting some knowledge, and not because of their own ideological consciousness. After joining the revolutionary ranks, they had little contact with the masses. Some comrades lived in schools for a long time and never left the circle of petty-bourgeois intellectuals. They naturally excused their shortcomings, so the "Kerry-Kong" ideology was also very serious. If they were not transformed, it would be a crisis. Therefore, everyone was determined to learn from the masses, make peasant friends, and get closer to the peasants ideologically and emotionally, laying the foundation for future work in the countryside. Comrade Wang Zhongqing encouraged all comrades of the newspaper, explaining that the Propaganda Department had great confidence in the newspaper's study and believed that they would definitely achieve results. However, he hoped that every comrade would make up their minds, take a bath, improve their thinking, and lay the ideological foundation for Mao Zedong Thought in the future. To do this well, it is necessary to rely on the comrades' consciousness, with everyone's help, to rectify their own thoughts and standpoints, improve their work enthusiasm and sense of responsibility, and run the newspaper well. Inspired by the symposium, the determination and enthusiasm of all members of the company to thoroughly examine themselves became even higher. Everyone expressed their opinions, and finally Comrade Yuan Bo put forward two thoughts: First, after listening to the reports from the bookstore and the Literary Federation, I felt that our learning leadership was not grasping tightly enough. The leadership of the bookstore and the Literary Federation not only grasped the specific thoughts of each comrade tightly, but also provided very good help, which is worth learning from us. Second, the land reform learning period of the newspaper was successful, but not in-depth. The learning experience of the bookstore and the Literary Federation enlightened us and promoted our examination work. Every comrade must turn around ideologically and from a standpoint during the study to achieve the goal of transforming themselves and transforming the newspaper. That night, the Academic Committee of the organization reviewed the learning in the previous stage and decided to deepen the examination movement. Every comrade must dig out the "air-raid shelters" in their minds and dig out the roots of filth. In terms of steps, each group should first examine the ideological obstacles that are not in-depth, and move from examining thoughts and standpoints to examining "Kerry-Kong". Only by doing the first step well can we clear the "Kerry-Kong" well, and only by clearing the "Kerry-Kong" ideology can we complete the task of investigating class and investigating ideology. Now, all groups are actively taking action, and the data room has also gained some experience. In investigating family composition, they adopted the method of informal group discussions to carefully examine the ideological influence of the family class on themselves, and after maturing, they reported it at formal meetings. This method is easy to go in-depth, and all groups in the company are promoting it.

　　本报举行思想检查座谈会
    全体同志决心查立场
  　文联书店谈经验启示很大
    【本报讯】响应廖承志同志“检查新闻工作者立场，检查克里空思想”的号召，本报全体同志，正以紧张学习来迎接即将来临的“九一”纪念节。全社同志，从上月二十日起，即在中直总支“查田、查阶级、查思想”的指示下，投入这一运动中。每个同志都暴露出自己在土改运动中许多糊涂观念和非阶级思想。但是在检查运动中也碰到一些阻碍，编辑部门有的干部认为：“我家不是解放区，我是在城市长大的，很早离开了地主家庭，思想上没有什么问题”；经理部门有些同志虽然经常和地主家庭息息相关，可是不敢大胆暴露，怕说自己是地主富农。这些思想障碍着全馆检查运动迅速深入的展开。本月中旬，袁勃同志参加太行通讯员会议回来，报告了太行通讯员热烈检查立场与克里空思想的情形，给全体同志的检查运动以极大鼓舞和兴奋。特别是廖承志同志的指示，有力的批判了在检查运动中，认为对地主立场不明确而能对反蒋反美立场明确的观点，同时也指出了“夸大文化水平”与“技术观点”均轻重倒置，限制了报纸真正为人民服务。因此每个记者和编辑必须面向工农，在采访中，能够很好报导群众的真实情况，反映农民的真实要求，编辑在改写稿件中，也应当是吸取群众要求的过程，剪裁也只是如何把农民的要求反映得更突出。只有这样，才能很好为人民服务。中央局宣传部副部长张磐石同志指示：每个同志都应该很好的检查地主思想，检查面向工农、面向本区、面向现实，这都是一个立场问题，克里空思想，也就是立场问题。对以上问题表现立场不稳，都是“克里空”；查“克里空”就是查这些。这些指示，对全社每个同志的反省检查，提出了极明确的方向和启示，大家都感到过去检查太不深入，决心在下一检查运动中，把自己思想提高一步。学委会根据全社同志要求和情绪，为了更深入的推进这一检查运动学习其他机关的经验，特于二十二日邀请新华书店王春、赵树理，边区文联荒煤，欧阳山等同志，举行思想检查学习座谈会，中央局宣传部王中青同志，亦出席参加。书店特点是地方干部比较多，土改运动对他们有直接影响，王春同志介绍他们的经验是：先让大家尽情的谈土改运动中的各种想法，挖出思想上、行动上的各种防空洞，然后再明确立场，因此开始不能一下子即学习文件，而必须着重摸心思。其次，检查中要民主一些，让大家能把一切都暴露出来。若是刚暴露一点即进行批判，就会堵住防空洞的大门。赵树理同志更生动的从他所参加小组一位典型同志的反省的经过，说明从地主家庭出身的人，抵抗土地改革思想的顽固，并不如某些同志所想的那样简单，如该地主出身干部，当家庭被群众斗争后，他就在他的秘密日记中，写着：“月亮弯弯照九洲，几家欢乐几家愁；家家过年吃饺子，独有我家泪双流。”但是，到处都在挤封建，这些防空洞在任何地方也不能隐藏，最终只有彻底清算之一途。荒煤同志介绍了文联检查学习的情形，他们机关大部分是城市知识份子，因此大家都强调走向革命的光荣历史。他们的经验是首先强调从思想上解决问题，每个同志都把自己作为党的干部，从工作上，思想上提高一步入手，去诚恳坦白的检讨，其次，是强调大家应站在阶级立场上敢于暴露自己，用阶级分析方法，大胆进行检查。这样检查的结果，大家才猛然认识到自己这样出身的人，与革命的关系原来是很薄弱的，是因为各种机缘或是接受一种知识而参加的，并不是因为自己思想上的自觉。来到革命队伍以后，与群众联系也很少，有些同志更长期住在学校里，长期没有离开过小资产阶级知识分子的圈子，对自己的缺点，都抱着很自然的原谅态度，因此“克里空”思想，也很严重，若不改造，就是一个危机，因此大家都决心向群众学习，交农民朋友，从思想上感情上和农民接近起来，打下今后下乡工作的基础。王中青同志勉励报社全体同志，说明宣传部对报社的学习，抱着很大信心，一定能够学出成绩，但希望每个同志痛下决心，洗一个澡，把思想提高一步，给今后毛泽东思想打下思想基础。要想作好这件事情必须依同志们的自觉，在大家的帮助下，去整好自己的思想和立场，提高工作的积极性，和责任心，把报纸办好。在座谈会的影响启发下，全社同志彻底检查自己的决心与情绪更加高涨，大家纷纷发表意见，最后袁勃同志提出两点感想：第一、听了书店文联的报告，感到我们的学习领导还抓得不紧，书店文联领导上对每个同志的具体思想不但抓得紧，还作了很好的帮助，值得我们学习。第二、报社土改学习这一时期是有成绩的，但不深入，书店文联学习经验给予我们的启示，推动了我们的检查工作，每个同志，必须在学习中，从思想上，立场上扭过来，以达到改造自己改造报纸的目的。当晚，机关学委会检讨了上一阶段的学习，决定深入检查运动，每个同志都要挖自己思想上的防空洞，挖污根，步骤上各小组先检查不深入的思想障碍，由查思想查立场到查克里空，只有第一步作好，才能很好清算克里空，也只有清算了克里空思想，才能完成查阶级查思想的任务。现在各小组已积极行动起来，资料室也获得一些经验；在查家庭成份中，采取了小组漫谈，细致检查家庭阶级给自己的思想影响，酝酿成熟，即在正式会议上报告，这样的方法容易深入，全社各组正推行中。
