    Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 2nd. Shanghai News reports: Shanghai's patriotic students have been detained by the Chiang bandits for nearly two months, and most have not yet been released. According to parents of students who visited them: The detention center is extremely hot, the environment is harsh, and with all kinds of abuse and torture, many arrested students have fallen ill. A student from Great China University suffers from dysentery, Liang Tong from Datong University has been suffering from typhoid fever for days, and Bao Jingpei, a female student from Fudan University, has had a relapse of heart disease due to shock. Although the parents of the students have repeatedly requested treatment outside, the Chiang government has unreasonably refused. The students' parents believe that detaining those suffering from infectious diseases or who are seriously ill is tantamount to killing them by proxy, intending to put all the imprisoned students to death. If their children unfortunately die in prison, the Chiang government should bear the responsibility for murder.
    Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 3rd. Shanghai News: The English-language "Continental Daily" run by the Chiang family in Shanghai published on the 27th of last month confirming that private universities such as Datong, Zhijiang, and Hujiang, and some middle schools, were forced to expel or dismiss a large number of students due to "political reasons and participation in the student aid movement." The Chiang family's Ministry of Education hastily issued a "This is where I buried the silver" type of sophistry on the 30th, but failed to cover up this well-known fact.
    Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 2nd. The Chiang gang has recently arrested people in Shanghai on a large scale. According to a TASS dispatch from Shanghai on the 29th: More than 20 people in Shanghai's cultural circles were arrested last week, including famous painters and many editors of the "Wenhui Bao," which advocated democracy and freedom and had already been closed by the Shanghai authorities. A bookstore was surrounded by military police, and all the store employees were arrested and detained. Searches of other bookstores and printing factories in Shanghai are currently underway.

    蒋党变相杀人
    上海被捕爱国学生
    害传染病亦不释放
    【新华社陕北二日电】沪报讯：上海爱国学生，被蒋贼拘禁至今将逾两月，大部仍未释放。据曾前往探视之学生家长称：拘留所中天气酷热、环境恶劣，加以种种虐待折磨，被捕学生病倒者颇众，大夏大学学生某生患痢疾，大同大学学生梁通患伤寒有日，复旦大学女生鲍静佩受惊心脏病复发，虽经诸生家长一再请求出外治疗，但均为蒋政府无理拒绝。学生家长均认为，患传染病或病重而仍加以拘禁，揆其用心，实不啻借刀杀人，欲置全体被囚学生于死地，其子弟如不幸病死狱中，则蒋政府应负杀人犯罪责。
    【新华社陕北三日电】沪讯：上海蒋家所办英文大陆报，于上月廿七日刊载证实署期中大同、之江、沪江等私立大学及若干中学迫令大批学生退学或予以开除，系由于“政治原因及参加助学运动”，蒋家教育部为此于卅日慌忙发出“此地无银三百两”之狡辩，但并未能掩盖此一众所周知的事实。
    【新华社陕北二日电】蒋党在上海近又大肆捕人，据塔斯社沪二十九日电：上周上海文化界有二十人以上被捕，包括名画家及业已为上海当局封闭的主张民主自由的文汇报编辑多人在内。某书店被宪兵包围，全体店员被逮捕拘禁。对沪市其他书店及印刷厂之搜查，现正进行中。
