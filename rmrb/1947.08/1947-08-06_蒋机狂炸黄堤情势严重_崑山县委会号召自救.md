    Xinhua News Agency, Jinji Luyu, 4th: The great flood has begun, and Chiang Kai-shek's planes are intensifying their bombing of the Yellow River embankment. The situation along the embankment is extremely serious. The Kunshan County Committee of the Chinese Communist Party in Jiluyu convened a cadre meeting of various districts along the river on July 26 to deploy emergency flood prevention work: (1) Deepen mobilization, so that every member of the masses is alert to Chiang’s scheme of breaching the dike to cause disaster and actively carry out flood prevention and self-salvation. (2) Transform flood control headquarters at all levels into flood prevention and self-salvation headquarters. Organize flood prevention and self-salvation teams and emergency rescue teams from the young and strong in villages within fifteen *li* of the embankment. (3) Divide the work into sections for each village, set up sentry posts, and send people to guard the dams day and night, report water conditions, and bring gongs, drums, door panels, sacks, hemp ropes, straw bundles, iron shovels, wood and other equipment for emergency rescue. Be prepared to rush to the rescue at any time. Key cadres of the county and district must personally go to the embankment to inspect and supervise. If any dangerous situation is discovered, mobilize all forces to rescue it.

    Xinhua News Agency, Jinji Luyu, 4th: (Delayed) An American-made Chiang Kai-shek "P51" No. 634 fighter plane was forced to land in a certain area of the Jiluyu liberated area on the afternoon of July 22 due to a mechanical failure. The plane was seized by our forces, and the pilot, Pan Chengyu, lieutenant deputy squadron leader of the 38th Squadron of the 3rd Brigade of Chiang's Air Force, was captured and has been sent to the military region.
