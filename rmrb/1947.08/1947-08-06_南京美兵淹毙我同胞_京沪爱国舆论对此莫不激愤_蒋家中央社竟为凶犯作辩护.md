Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 3rd: Nanjing reports: Just as Chiang's government officials, both civil and military, were toasting and fawning over their American master, Wedemeyer, another tragedy occurred in Nanjing where American soldiers pushed our compatriots into the water, causing them to drown. One night, American soldiers Arriaque, Sefini, and two others were driving past Guanghua Gate. Two of them got out of the car and, without any explanation, pushed two of our compatriots, Wang Shouben and another person, who were sleeping by the bridge, into the river, causing them to drown. After the tragedy occurred, the entire city was shocked. Nanjing citizens, who have suffered greatly from the harm caused by American soldiers, were extremely angry about this and unanimously demanded that the murderers be severely punished. Discussions on the streets all criticized the traitorous Chiang government for condoning the rampant behavior of American soldiers and should bear serious responsibility for this.

Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 4th: The details of the tragedy in Nanjing where American soldiers unreasonably pushed our compatriots into the water, causing them to drown, are as follows, according to a compilation of news agency reports from Nanjing on the 3rd: Late at night on the 1st, American soldiers were driving near Guanghua Gate when they encountered several of our compatriots passing by. The American military police stopped the car to ask for directions. Because our compatriots could not understand English, they could not answer. The American military police, without asking any questions, grabbed a civilian, Wang Shouben, and threw him into the river, causing him to drown immediately. Another American soldier grabbed Ge Fatian, a 16-year-old sergeant nurse from the 5th Air Force Brigade of the Chiang army, and threw him into the river, also causing him to drown immediately. According to the New People's Evening News: When the victims cried for help, this group of beastly American soldiers not only did not offer assistance but also laughed loudly and attempted to commit a third act of violence. However, the other Chinese compatriots had already fled, so the tragedy did not continue to escalate. The bodies of the two innocent victims have now been found, both swollen all over, in a tragic state. The names of the two American soldier murderers have been identified as Sefini, an American army sergeant, and Arriaque, a corporal. After this extremely brutal act of violence occurred, Chiang Kai-shek's Central News Agency shamelessly defended the murderous American soldiers, falsely describing them as "drunken American soldiers" in an attempt to lessen the American soldiers' culpability and curry favor with American imperialism. However, public opinion in Nanjing and Shanghai is extremely angry about this tragedy, believing that this American soldier atrocity, like countless past American soldier atrocities, is the inevitable result of American imperialism's illegal stationing of troops in China, aiding Chiang Kai-shek in the civil war, and trying to turn China into a colony. Unless the American invading forces are driven out of China, the survival and freedom of the Chinese people will not be guaranteed.

    南京美兵淹毙我同胞
    京沪爱国舆论对此莫不激愤
    蒋家中央社竟为凶犯作辩护
    【新华社陕北三日电】南京讯：正当蒋政府文武官僚与其美国主人魏德迈觥筹交错大献殷勤之际，京市又发生美军推我同胞落水淹死惨剧。一日晚，美军阿尔锐区、赛芬尼等四人，驶车经过光华门，其中二人下车不说明任何原因，即将露宿桥畔之我国同胞王守本等两人推入河中，惨遭淹毙。惨案发生后，全市轰动，饱受美军祸害的南京市民，对此极端愤激，一致要求严惩凶手，街谈巷议，均斥责丧权卖国纵容美军横行的蒋政府，对此应担负严重责任。
    【新华社陕北四日电】南京美军无理推我同胞下水淹死惨剧，综合各通讯社南京三日消息，其详情如下：一日晚夜半，美军驾车在光华门外附近行驶，遇有我国同胞数人经过，美宪兵停车问路，我同胞因不懂英语无法回答，美宪兵即不问情由，将一平民王守本抓住投入河中，立遭淹毙，另一美国兵又抓住一年仅十六岁之蒋军空军第五大队上士看护葛发田投入河中，亦立遭淹毙。据新民晚报称：当被害者呼喊求救时，此一群兽性美军非但不予援救，反纵声大笑，并企图作第三次行凶，但是时其他中国同胞均已走避，故惨剧未继续扩大。现无辜被害者两尸首均已发现，全身浮肿，状至悲惨。两美军凶手姓名已查明，一为美军中士赛芬尼，另一则为伍长阿尔锐区。此一极端凶残之暴行案发生后，蒋家中央社竟无耻的为行凶美军辩护，无中生有的称之为“酗酒美军”，企图减轻美军罪责，以博取美帝国主义的欢心。但京沪社会舆论对此惨案极为愤怒，认为这次美军暴行与过去无数次美军暴行一样，是美帝国主义非法驻军中国，援助蒋介石内战，要把中国变为殖民地的政策的必然结果，除非把美国侵略势力赶出中国去，中国人民的生存与自由即无保障。
