　　【Taiyue Dispatch from Our Newspaper, 18th】Post offices in the various counties of the Southern Shanxi New District are actively establishing rural postal organizations, and have achieved great results in the past three months. A total of 2,630 li of rural postal routes have been established throughout the Southern Shanxi New District, connecting all 69 district offices in the 15 counties to the rural postal trunk lines, and establishing 38 agency offices (including two remodeled old postal agencies) to sell stamps. Postal workers depart once every other day, delivering mail and newspapers to all district offices and agency offices, and also delivering letters and newspapers to half of the administrative villages along the way. The 41 agency offices and sales points not only accept regular and registered mail, sell stamps, and subscribe to newspapers, but also organize the masses to deliver mail and newspapers to nearby villages. Newspapers and mail in two-thirds of the villages in the 15 counties are delivered by some agency offices, greatly developing the rural communication network and reducing the number of postal workers. For example, Wanquan County organized eight agency offices, assigning several villages under each agency office as its area of responsibility, clarifying responsibilities to avoid mutual disputes. Out of the county's 99 administrative villages, the county post office directly delivers to 39 villages, and the nine agency offices deliver to 60 villages. Therefore, since June, newspapers arriving at the county post office in the county, have been delivered to 40 administrative villages on the same day. When there is a fair, two-thirds of the villages can see the newspaper on the same day, and the remaining villages can see it the next day. Xia County's rural distribution organization has three forms: one is based on the study center, with each school sending students to the center to pick up mail, which is punctual and reliable. The second is based on the key village as the center, with each key village assigning six villages to take turns sending people to the district to pick up letters and newspapers every day and send them to each village. The third is for students to transfer along the villages, and in areas close to the guerrilla zones, the militia armed to deliver. Due to the widespread development of rural communication and distribution, all mail and newspapers, whether on the trunk line or rural postal line, can be delivered quickly and in a timely manner, powerfully helping the land reform movement in the new district.

　　晋南新区乡邮密布
  　邮线二千余里村村寄递方便
    【本报太岳十八日电】晋南新区各县邮局积极建立乡邮组织，三个月来已获得很大成绩。晋南新区全境共建立起乡村邮线二千六百三十里，将十五个县的六十九座区公所全部贯穿在乡邮干线上，并建立起三十八个代办所（内有二个旧邮代办所改造的），代售邮票处。邮局邮工隔日出发一次，除投递全部区公所与代办所的邮件报纸外，并沿线投递二分之一行政村的信件与书报。四十一个代头所与代售处除接受平信、挂号及零售邮票、代订报纸外，并组织群众力量投递附近村庄的邮件及报纸。十五个县三分之二村庄的报纸邮件，是依靠有些代办所投递的，大大发展了农村的通讯网，减少了邮工的编制。如万泉县组织了八个代办所，在每个代办所的下面，分给若干村庄，作为任务范围，明确责任，以免互相扯。全县共九十九个行政村，县邮一直接投递的是三十九个村，九个代子所即传递了六十个村。因此该县从六月份起，报纸到达县局，即有四十个行政村当日看到报纸。如逢集，则有三分之二的村庄当天可看到，其余的村庄第二天即可看到。夏县的乡村发行组织有三种形式：一种是以学习为中心点，各校派学生到中心点去取，按时并可靠。一种是以基点村为中心，每一基点所属六个村轮流每天派人到区上取信件及报纸？送至各村。第三种是学生沿村转送，接近游击区的由民兵武装投递。由于乡村通讯发行的普遍发展，使一切邮件及书报不论在干线与乡村邮线上，均作到投递迅速及时，有力的帮助了新区土地改革运动。
