【Taixing News from this newspaper】Due to the attention of cadres from top to bottom in Ping Shun, during the production gap after spring plowing and sowing, all villages in the county universally launched a fiscal rectification movement. They sorted out materials buried over the years and everything unattended to, using them as village funds and production capital, investing in cooperatives, and opening workshops. This not only achieved self-sufficiency in village funds but also supported the development of local construction undertakings, substantially turning dead finances into a living economy. After the rectification, among the county's 178 administrative villages, 96 villages could achieve self-sufficiency with surplus, and 65 villages could achieve self-sufficiency, accounting for more than 90% of all villages. Only 17 villages did not do enough thoroughly and failed to achieve production self-sufficiency. These significant achievements concretely supported the front lines, enriched local finances, and reduced the burden on the masses. In the movement, they used bold and unfettered leadership methods, promoted mass creativity, and pushed village financial work to a new stage, providing many new experiences for carrying out fiscal rectification movements throughout the region. This spirit of wholeheartedly seeking the interests of the people is worthy of learning. The Taihang Administrative Office specially issued a commendation, and all county cadres were collectively awarded a major merit.

　　领导全县整顿财政成绩卓著
  　平顺干部集体记功
    【本报太行讯】平顺由于自上而下的干部注意，在春耕下种后的一段生产空隙，全县各村普遍开展整理财政运动，把历年来埋藏之物资及无人过问的一切东西，清理出来作为村经费生产资金，投资合作社，开设作坊，不仅做到了村经费自给，且扶植了地方建设事业之发展，相当做到了死财政变为活经济。经整理后全县一百七十八个行政村，能做到自给自足而有余的九十六村，自给自足的六十五村，占所有村百分之九十以上，只有十七个村做的不够彻底，达不到生产自给。这种显著的成绩，具体支援了前线，富裕了地方财政，减轻了群众负担。并在运动中运用了大胆放手的领导方法，发扬了群众的创造，使村财政工作推向新的阶段，对全区开展整理财政运动提供不少新的经验，这种全心全意为人民谋利益的精神，值得学习，太行行署特通令表扬，全县干部集体记大功一次。
