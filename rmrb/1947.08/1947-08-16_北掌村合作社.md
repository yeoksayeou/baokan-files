　　North Zhang Village Cooperative
    Lin Li
    North Zhang is located in the fourth district of Shahe and was liberated during the great counter-offensive in 1945.
    In the spring of last year, the county cooperative went to North Zhang to organize a cooperative. When the masses heard the words "cooperative," they remembered the painful experience of being deceived and killed by the Japanese invaders' "cooperative" in the past, and quietly slipped away.
    North Zhang is a place that produces good lime. Seeing that the cooperative could not be established, comrades from the county cooperative proposed raising shares to burn lime, and quickly raised 76,200 yuan in shares. By the wheat harvest, seven kilns of lime had been burned, yielding a net profit of 560,000 yuan, with each yuan earning 7.3 yuan. In July, the county cooperative called for the establishment of a credit cooperative. Comrade Liu Shiping, the manager of North Zhang Village, thought that burning lime had brought a lot of profit to the masses and was in high spirits. He was sure that raising shares would not be a problem, so he guaranteed to his superiors: "I guarantee to raise 400,000 shares when I go back!"
    After the news of the credit cooperative's share raising spread, landlords and special agents spread rumors saying, "The Eighth Route Army has a tofu mouth and a knife heart. They are sweet at first and then bitter, so be careful!" Therefore, Liu Shiping excitedly told the masses at the meeting, "Burning lime has made a lot of money. I think everyone is willing to continue. Do you want to continue or divide it?" But the masses' reply was, "Divide! Divide! Divide!" The plan to expand shares failed, and the cadres were very discouraged. But the masses became suspicious of the landlords and special agents' rumors: "Why did we divide when we said we wanted to divide? No one dared to say that before. Even if we said it, the officials wouldn't pay attention to it, and it would be useless." After refuting the rumors, the masses' awareness gradually increased, and they realized that they had been deceived.
    In September, the masses were organized to discuss the benefits of burning lime again based on the burning lime foundation. This had a great impact on the masses. When making production plans, everyone proposed to burn 100 kilns, which would require 2 million yuan. The county cooperative believed that the strength of one village was not enough and suggested that the joint defense zone should handle it together. The masses said, "That won't work. The lime kiln is a treasure of our Shahe. We can't let other villages join!" In order to take care of the masses' demands, the leaders believed that if they didn't want to join, they wouldn't. They immediately raised shares and quickly raised more than 3.39 million yuan. Because a lot of money was raised and couldn't all be used for burning lime, eight "counters" such as oil workshops, flower workshops, vinegar shops, and restaurants were organized, employing 43 workers. By the end of the year, 19 kilns of lime had been burned, and the eight "counters" together made a profit of 5,027,000 yuan. At a time when various businesses were booming, the county cooperative pointed out that a credit cooperative should be established to restore rural lending relations. Because the cooperative had gained the trust of the masses, the call to establish a credit cooperative was immediately supported by the broad masses. Every household and everyone in the village invested in shares, and soon raised more than 850,000 yuan. The credit cooperative was declared established, and the funds were gradually lent to the masses for production. At the end of the year, it was settled that the masses had made a profit of 430,000 yuan by using the credit cooperative's loans for production.
    At this time, the biggest problem for the credit cooperative was that it only lent money out, and no one came to deposit money anymore. The reason was that the interest rate was low, and the profits from industry, commerce, and sideline businesses were high. However, the credit cooperative could not attract scattered funds from the masses without raising shares. After discussion, the masses decided to allow free investment in shares and free withdrawal of shares, and the interest would be distributed proportionally according to the amount and time of deposit when the final accounts were settled. The credit cooperative and the industrial and commercial production cooperative were merged to increase the deposit interest rate. The masses borrowed money from various counters, and funds could be borrowed temporarily between the various counters. In order to support the textile and sideline industries, a special loan of 1 million yuan was allocated for textiles and 2 million yuan for sideline industries.
    After this method was stipulated, the credit department's shares gradually expanded. As of around July, 5,158,000 yuan had been lent to the masses, combined with 23,400,000 yuan of private funds from the masses for production. The masses made a total profit of 5,450,000 yuan, bought back 21 carts, repaired 21 carts, bought back 5 mules, 6 donkeys, 24 cattle, 15 cloth machines, and 75 accelerated spinning wheels, which greatly supported agriculture, sideline industries, and the textile industry during the famine.
    In March of this year, the North Zhang Cooperative added a woodworking factory and 11 small textile factories to produce donkey-pulled and human-pedaled cotton bows, as well as waterwheels, plows, shares, towels, and homespun cloth. At this time, a serious crisis arose. Cotton bows, which accounted for a large amount of capital, could not be sold, and the morale of the masses plummeted. After extensive investigation, it was discovered that the reason the bows could not be sold was that people did not dare to buy them because they did not know how to repair them when they broke down. The factory then assigned a skilled worker to go out to repair them and was responsible for teaching the bow users how to repair them, so the sales problem was solved, which boosted the confidence of all shareholders.
    The North Zhang Credit Cooperative has struggled to grow stronger from various difficulties, and now has a strong capital of 8.8 million yuan. Its manager, Liu Shiping, has been selected as a model for the cooperative cause in the Shahe New District.

　　北掌村合作社
    林里
    北掌在沙河四区，一九四五年大反攻时才解放。
    去年春天，县联社去北掌组织合作社，群众一听说“合作社”，想起过去被日寇“合作社”欺骗杀害的惨痛经验，都悄悄溜走了。
    北掌是出好石灰的地方，县联社同志，看见合作社搞不成，提出集股烧灰，很快召集起七万六千二百元的股金。到麦收，烧了七窑灰，得纯利五十六万元，每一元赚了七元三角。七月间县联社号召成立信用社，北掌村经理刘士平同志想烧灰给群众谋利很多，情绪正高，召股一定不成问题，于是，他向上级保证：“我回去保证召股四十万！”
    信用社召股的消息传出来后，地主特务就造谣说：“八路军是豆腐嘴，刀子心，先甜后辣，可都小心点！”因此，刘士平兴高采烈的在大会上给群众说：“烧灰赚了很多钱，我想大家一定愿干下去，你们说往下干还是分呀？而群众的答复却是：“分！分！分！”扩大股金的计划失败了，干部非常泄气，但群众对地主特务的造谣却起了疑心：“为什么咱说分就分了。从前没人敢说，即便说了，官家不理，还不是白的”。经批驳谣言，群众觉悟渐逐提高，才知道是上当了。
    九月间，再从烧灰基础上组织群众讨论烧灰的好处，对群众影响非常大。订生产计划时，大家提出要烧一百窑，需要钱二百万元，县联社认为一村力量不够，提议联防区伙办。群众说：“那可不行，灰窑是咱沙河一大宝，可不能给外村伙！”领导上为了照顾群众要求，认为不伙就不伙，马上集股，很快集起三百三十九万余元，因集款很多，烧灰用不完，于是又组织了油坊、花坊、醋铺、饭店等八个“柜头”，有职工四十三人，到年底烧灰十九窑，连八个“柜头”共获利五百零二万七千元。在各种生意兴隆的时候，县联社指出成立信用社，以恢复农村借贷关系，因为合作社已获得群众的信赖，成立信用社的号召，立刻得到广大群众的拥护，全村家家入股，人人入股，很快集起八十五万余元。信用社宣告成立，把款逐渐都贷给群众生产，年底结帐，群众贷信用社款生产获利四十三万元。
    这时信用社的最大问题，是只往外贷款，再没人来存款，原因是利息少，工商副业利润大，但是，信用社不召股，又无法吸取分散的群众游资，经群众讨论规定，自由入股，自由抽股，利息到总算帐时，按存款的数额时间平均分红。信用社和工商业生产合作社合并，以提高存款利率，群众贷款到各柜头去贷，各个柜头之间，资金可临时借取。为扶植纺织和副业，特抽纺织贷款一百万元，副业贷款二百万元。
    这一办法规定后，信用部股金，日渐扩大，截至七月前后，贷给群众五百十五万八千元，结合群众私资二千三百四十万元，从事生产，群众共获利五百四十五万元，买回大车二十一辆，修理大车二十一辆，买回骡子五头，驴六头，牛二十四头，布机十五架，加速轮纺车七十五辆，对生产渡荒中的农业、副业、纺织业都起了极大的支持作用。
    今年三月，北掌合作社又增设木工厂，小型纺织厂十一座，制驴拉和人蹬弹花弓及水车、犁、铧、毛巾、土布；这时产生了严重的危机，占资本很大的弹花弓，卖不出去，群众情绪一落千丈。经多方调查，发现卖不出弓的原因，是因为这种弓出了毛病不会修理，群众不敢买，该厂乃专抽一技术工人，出外去修理，并负责教会用弓人修理，于是销售问题解决了，鼓舞了所有入股群众的信心。
    北掌信用合作社已从各种困难中挣扎壮大起来，现在共集有八百八十万元的雄厚资本。它的经理刘士平已被选为沙河新区合作事业的模范。
