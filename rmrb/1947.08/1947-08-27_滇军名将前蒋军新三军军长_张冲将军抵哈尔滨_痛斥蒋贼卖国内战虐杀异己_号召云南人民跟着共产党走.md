Xinhua News Agency, Northeast, August 24th: General Zhang Chong, a renowned general from Yunnan and former commander of the Kuomintang's New Third Army, indignant at Chiang Kai-shek's betrayal of the country, engagement in civil war, and massacre of dissidents, escaped the heavy surveillance of secret agents and arrived in the Northeast Liberated Area via Nanjing this summer. He recently arrived safely in Harbin. General Zhang is 48 years old, from Luxi County, Yunnan Province, and of minority ethnicity. He has been in the military for over 30 years, from the early years of the Republic when fighting against Yuan Shikai to the War of Resistance Against Japan. He has held positions as company, battalion, brigade, division, and army commander. During the War of Resistance Against Japan, he served as the deputy commander of the Yunnan 60th Army and commander of the 184th Division, leading troops in battles such as Taierzhuang and Wuhan. Later, because he strongly advocated unity and democracy, he was disliked by Chiang Kai-shek and transferred to the New Third Army, an army rife with Chiang's secret agents. After the Xiang-Gui Campaign, witnessing the corruption and incompetence of Chiang's military and political institutions and facing obstruction everywhere, Zhang firmly resigned his post and returned to his hometown to develop water conservancy projects. In 1944, when the Japanese invaders attacked Yunnan, he rose up to defend his home and country, serving as the Second Route Commander of the Yunnan Front until the Japanese surrendered, after which he was again forced to retire. Last November, Zhang was designated as a minority representative to Chiang's "National Assembly." He took advantage of the opportunity to go to Nanjing and escaped from Chiang's clutches to come to the Liberated Area.

Xinhua News Agency, Northeast, August 24th: Over a thousand representatives from all walks of life in Harbin held a grand gathering on the 21st to welcome General Zhang Chong, the former commander of the KMT's New Third Army, who had recently arrived from the KMT-controlled area. Attendees included Yan Baohang, Chairman of Liaobei Province; Xu Shouxuan, member of the Northeast Political Committee; Pan Shuoduan and Zheng Zuzhi, commander and deputy commander of the Democratic Allied Army; Xiao Zecang, a respected elder from Yunnan; General Han Meicun, commander of the First Brigade of the Rehe Provincial Democratic National Salvation Army, who rose up in May; Chen Kaiwen, commander of the Yunnan New 184th Division, who laid down his arms in Meihekou in June; and patriotic Yunnan soldiers from the Democratic Allied Army and the Democratic United Army, all gathering together to symbolize the bright future of the Yunnan people's liberation. General Zhang Chong delivered a passionate two-hour speech, bitterly recounting his personal experience of Chiang Kai-shek eliminating non-direct armies. He said, "Chiang Kai-shek is a shameless, untrustworthy schemer who cares nothing for the lives of the people." After comparing the Liberated Area with the KMT-controlled area, General Zhang said, "Only by following the Communist Party and the people and soldiers of the Liberated Area can the people of Yunnan be liberated." Yan Baohang, Xu Shouxuan, Xiao Zecang, and others spoke successively, believing that General Zhang Chong's arrival from the KMT-controlled area to participate in work in the Liberated Area, and General Han Meicun's raising of the banner of righteousness on the front lines of the civil war, demonstrated that the patriotic democratic movement in the KMT-controlled area had become closely linked with the patriotic self-defense war in the Liberated Area, further increasing the confidence and courage of the people of the whole country in victory.

    【新华社东北二十四日电】滇军著名将领，前国民党新编第三军军长张冲将军，愤于蒋介石卖国内战，虐杀异己，逃脱特务重重监视，于今夏由南京辗转前来东北解放区，日前安抵哈尔滨市。张将军四十八岁，云南泸西县人，出身少数民族，自民初讨袁至抗日战争，投身戎马生活三十余年。历任营、团、旅、师、军长等职。抗日战争中曾任滇军六十军副军长兼一八四师师长，率部参加台儿庄、武汉等战役。后因力主团结民主，遭蒋贼之忌，调任蒋军特务密布之新编第三军军长。湘、桂战役后，张氏目击蒋家军政机构之腐败无能，处处受掣，坚辞该职，返里兴办水利。四四年因日寇进攻云南，愤起保家御敌，出任云南前线第二路总指挥，迄日寇投降后又被迫解甲归田。去年十一月张氏被指定为蒋记“国大”少数民族代表，当乘赴南京机会，逃出蒋贼魔掌，前来解放区。
    【新华社东北二十四日电】哈市各界代表千余人二十一日举行盛大集会，欢迎新从蒋管区抵此的前蒋军新编第三军军长张冲将军。与会者有辽北省主席阎宝航、东北政委会委员徐寿轩、民主同盟军正副军长潘朔端、郑祖志、云南耆宿萧泽苍、五月凌原起义之热河省民主救国军第一旅旅长韩梅村将军、六月梅河口放下武器的滇军新一八四师师长陈开文及民主同盟军与民主联军中之滇籍爱国军人等新知旧友，相聚一堂，象征云南人民解放的光明前途。张冲将军发表长达二小时之热烈演讲，痛述蒋贼消灭杂牌军之亲身体验，他说：“蒋介石是寡廉鲜耻，最无信义，最不管人民死活的阴谋家”。于比较解放区与蒋管区后，张将军说：“只有跟着共产党与解放区军民在一起，云南人民才能得到解放”。阎宝航、徐寿轩、萧泽苍等相继发言，认为张冲将军从蒋管区前来解放区参加工作，韩梅村将军在内战前线高举义旗，说明蒋管区爱国民主运动已与解放区爱国自卫战争密切结合，益增全国人民胜利的信心和勇气。
