　　Gucheng Inspects Land Reform: 30,000 Poor Peasants Still Lack Land
    [Report from this newspaper] Gucheng convened a county and district cadre conference on the 15th of last month, mobilizing cadres to prepare for a major re-examination. The conference summarized the land reform of the past year, stating that the elimination of feudalism was not thorough and the demands of the masses had not yet been satisfied. The entire county has 264 villages, 32,775 households, and approximately 150,000 people, with 658,960 mu of red grain land, averaging 4.4 mu per person. During the land reform, peasants recovered 40,232 mu of land. There were 938 extremely poor households, totaling 2,949 people. Assuming an average of 3 mu per person to fill the gap, they were allocated 8,847 mu of land, leaving a shortfall of 31,385 mu. There were also 10,488 poor peasant households, totaling 52,440 people. Even including their original land, only 20,927 people could be allocated land at 3 mu per person to fill the gap, leaving a shortfall of 31,513 people, requiring an additional 47,269.5 mu of land. The above only considers the minimum land needs of the peasants. In other aspects, such as housing and agricultural tools, the disparity is also very large. Conversely, landlords still possess more land and property than the peasants. It is still necessary to recover a large amount of land, houses, and property from the landlords and return them to the peasants. Currently, cadres throughout the county are preparing all necessary conditions to mobilize the masses for a thorough re-examination to fully satisfy the demands of the peasants.

　　故城检查土地改革　三万贫农尚缺土地
    【本报讯】故城于上月十五日召开县区干部大会，动员干部准备大复查。大会总结了年来的土地改革，封建消灭尚不彻底，群众要求还未满足：全县二百六十四个村、三万二千七百七十五户，约十五万人口，红粮地六十五万八千九百六十亩，每人平均四亩四分；土地改革中，农民收回土地四万零二百三十二亩，九百三十八户赤贫，二千九百四十九人，每人平均仅按填平三亩计算，分到土地八千八百四十七亩，下余三万一千三百八十五亩，尚有一万零四百八十八户贫农，五万二千四百四十人，连原有地在内也按三亩填平，只有二万零九百二十七人能分到土地，下余三万一千五百一十三人，尚需要土地四万七千二百六十九亩半。以上仅以农民需要土地的最低限度而言，其他如宅房、农具等等各方面亦相差很远。反观地主土地财产比农民还多的多，仍须从地主手中收回大批土地房屋及财物归还农民。现全县干部正准备一切必要条件，发动群众彻底复查，充分满足农民要求。
