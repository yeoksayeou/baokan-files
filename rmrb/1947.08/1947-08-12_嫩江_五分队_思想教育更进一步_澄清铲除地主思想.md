　　“Nenjiang” Fifth Detachment
  　Ideological Education Takes a Step Further
    Clarifying and Eradicating Landlord Ideology
    [Report from the Jilu豫 Front, this newspaper] The "Nenjiang" Fifth Detachment, through a month of political training, systematically conducted three ideological education initiatives among the soldiers: 1. The "Three-in-One" approach to studying current events; 2. The "Three-in-One" approach to ideological education; and 3. Clarifying and eradicating landlord ideology. In the study of current events, due to the mutual education between new and veteran soldiers, as well as liberated comrades, everyone strengthened their confidence in the counter-offensive. After ideological education, regionalism between new and veteran soldiers was overcome, class consciousness was deepened, and it was clarified that although our homes had been liberated, there were still many poor people across the country who had not been liberated and needed to continue the struggle. Some soldiers transformed quickly, and are now determined to "resolutely fight to the end for the complete liberation of poor friends."
    After a week of clearing out landlord ideology, in the final speeches, 90% of the soldiers clarified that struggling against landlords was completely reasonable. Even the muddled ideas of a very small number of soldiers were initially resolved. For example, in their speeches, Huo Qingji, Li Xini, Guo Sanhui, and Gao Rongming wept bitterly, recounting their painful lives under landlord oppression and the landlords' actions of driving people to their deaths, realizing that the struggle was very necessary. Comrades Tian Fujie and Shi Xiaobing, whose families had been struggled against, stated: "Poor peasants have suffered thousands of years of oppression from landlords, working their entire lives, with little food and no clothes. Struggling against these bloodsuckers—the landlords—is extremely reasonable and correct. We, the people's soldiers, fight for the people, precisely to liberate the laboring masses from the oppression and exploitation of landlords and capitalists. We resolutely support the people's great turn-around." (Wang Hutian)

　　“嫩江”五分队
  　思想教育更进一步
    澄清铲除地主思想
    【本报冀鲁豫前线讯】“嫩江”五分队一个月的政治整训，有组织的在战士中进行了三个思想教育，即：一、时事学习三合一；二、思想教育三合一；三、澄清与铲除地主思想。在时事学习中，由于新老战士和解放同志的互相教育，大家增强了反攻信心。思想教育后，克服了新老战士的地域观念，加深了阶级自觉，明确了虽然我家得了解放，但全国没有解放的穷人还多的很，还需继续斗争。有些战士转变的很快，现在下定决心“为彻底解放穷朋友，坚决干到底。”
    经过一礼拜清除地主思想，最后一次发言百分之九十的战士明确了斗争地主，完全是合理的，就是极少数战士的糊涂观念也得到初步解决，如发言中：霍庆吉、李喜妮、郭三会、高荣明痛哭流涕，把自己在地主压迫下的痛苦生活和地主逼死人命诉说一遍，认识斗争是非常应该的。家中被斗争的田福杰、石小兵等同志表示：“穷苦农民受地主几千年压迫，终身劳动，少吃无穿，斗争剥削他们的吸血鬼，——地主非常合理正确，我们人民战士，为人民战斗，就是为了解放劳苦群众不受地主资本家压迫和剥削。我们坚决拥护人民大翻身。”（王虎田）
