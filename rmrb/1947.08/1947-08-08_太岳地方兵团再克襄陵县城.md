Xinhua News Agency, Jinji-Luyu, 6th. (Delayed report) The Taiyue Local Troops recaptured Xiangling City on the 30th of last month. Since the enemy re-occupied Xiangling on the 12th of last month, they have been heavily besieged by us. On the 30th, more than 300 of the defending enemy’s Security Regiment 15 ventured out to loot grain. Our local troops and guerrillas, in order to lure the enemy in deep, fought and retreated. Between Beixindian (15 miles from the city) and Xucun, they launched a fierce counterattack, annihilating a portion of the enemy. The two companies of the 89th Regiment of the enemy Chiang army's 30th Brigade in the city rushed to aid, but when they retreated to Dongchaicun, eight miles from the city, they were again defeated by us. Our army immediately took advantage of the victory and recaptured Xiangling City. In this battle, we captured more than 130 enemy soldiers, including the Security Battalion Commander Chen Shikang, and killed or wounded 49. We suffered no casualties.

    太岳地方兵团再克襄陵县城
    【新华社晋冀鲁豫六日电】（迟到）太岳地方兵团上月三十日再度收复襄陵城。自上月十二日敌再陷襄陵后，即被我重重围困，三十日守敌保安十五团三百余出犯抢粮，我地方兵团与游击队为诱敌深入，且战且退，至北辛店（距城十五里）与徐村之间，猛予反击，歼敌一部，城内守敌蒋军三十旅八十九团两个连仓惶出援，当其退至距城八里之东柴村，又遭我们击溃，我军当即乘胜收复襄陵城。此役共俘敌保安大队长陈士康以下一百三十余名，毙伤四十九名，我无伤亡。
