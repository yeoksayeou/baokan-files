　　Xinhua News Agency, Northeast, August 8th: The summer wheat on both banks of the Songhua River has been completely harvested. Shuangcheng, Lalin, and Hulan counties mobilized men, women, and children to rush to harvest, thresh, and store the wheat, strengthening the "five preventions" work: "preventing rain, insects, special agents, birds, and wind." Currently, 2,400 hectares (1 hectare = 10 mu) of wheat in the Second District of Shuangcheng and 500 hectares of wheat in the Leye District of Hulan have been brought back to the threshing grounds and are being threshed and dried, striving to put them into storage in the short term. Poor households, which were previously unable to sow, have planted half a hectare to one hectare of wheat each this year. The wheat fields in each county have doubled compared to previous years, accounting for one-quarter to one-third of all cultivated land. This year, the wheat stalks are tall and large, unprecedented in decades. On average, each hectare can yield about three shi (1 shi = 500 jin). Stacks of wheat are piled up in villages and settlements, displaying a scene of abundant harvest.
　　Xinhua News Agency, West Manchuria, August 9th: Heilongjiang-Nenjiang Province has achieved great success in water conservancy construction in the past six months. This spring, the provincial government issued 36 million yuan in water conservancy loans. As of the end of June, seven waterway projects have been built, and 44 li of flood prevention dikes have been constructed. In the construction of waterway projects in Nianzishan, Zhujia Kan, and Woniutu in Longjiang County; Chahayang and Shenfa in Gannan County; An’anzhan in Nehe County; and Jingxing County in Tailai County, a total of 15,000 laborers were used. These projects can irrigate 6,000 hectares (1 hectare = 10 mu) of paddy fields, and it is estimated that 16 million jin of rice can be produced annually. In addition, the flood prevention dikes built in Lindian, Tailai, and Zhaodong counties can protect 110,000 hectares of fertile land from flooding.
　　Xinhua News Agency, Liaodong, August 8th: Construction in the newly recovered areas of Northeast China: (1) The 200-plus li railway line between Gaiping and Pulandian in the southern section of the China Changchun Railway was repaired and officially opened to traffic on July 1st and has begun handling passenger and freight transport and other businesses. Currently, passenger trains run daily from Pulandian to Lujiatun (north of Xiongyuecheng).
　　(2) Piziwo, a famous salt-producing area on the Liaodong Peninsula, has established a Salt Affairs Bureau to actively rectify and restore operations and has allocated more than 6 million yuan in relief funds, greatly improving the lives of more than 600 salt workers who previously lived on locust flower paste during the Kuomintang occupation, boosting their production enthusiasm.

  　黑嫩水利建设成就极大
    【新华社东北八日电】松花江两岸夏麦，已全部收割完毕。双城、拉林、呼兰各县动员男女老幼，一齐抢收、抢打、抢藏，加强“防雨、防虫、防特、防雀、防风”等五防工作。现双城二区二千四百垧（每垧十亩）小麦，呼兰乐业区五百垧小麦，均已拉回场院，正赶打晒干，争取短期内入仓。过去无力播种之贫户，今年每户均种麦半垧至一垧，各县麦地较往年增加一倍，占全部种地四分之一到三分之一。今年麦秆高大，为数十年来所未有，每垧平均可收获三石（每石五百斤）左右。各村屯麦垛垒垒，显示一片丰收景象。
    【新华社西满九日电】黑嫩省半年来水利建设成就极大。今春省府发放水利贷款三千六百万元，截至六月底止计已修建水道工程七处，筑防水堤四十四里。于建修龙江县之碾子山、朱家坎、卧牛吐；甘南县之察哈阳、神法；讷河县之在安站；与泰来县景星县之水道工程时，计费人工一万五千个，可灌溉水田六千垧（每垧十亩），预计每年可产稻一千六百万斤。另在林甸、泰来、肇东三县修筑之防水堤则可使十一万垧良田免于水患。
    【新华社辽东八日电】东北新收复区建设：（一）中长路南段盖平至普兰店间二百余里铁路线，于七月一日修复正式通车，并已开始办理客货运输等业务。目前普兰店至芦家屯（熊岳城之北）已每日均有客车开行。
    （二）辽东半岛著名产盐区貔子窝。已成立盐务局，积极整顿复业，并拨救济款六百余万元，使过去在蒋军侵占期间以槐花糊度日之六百余盐务工人生活大为改善，生产情绪倍增。
