Xinhua News Agency, Northeast, 24th. The Democratic Allied Forces Cadre Training Corps visited the liberated areas to observe the situation of joining the army to resist [the enemy], which greatly enlightened the cadres. According to Wang Guanlin, a participant, the training corps stayed in Yanan Village, Bei'an County, for ten days and witnessed that all 74 young people in the village joined the army voluntarily after being checked by themselves, their families, and the district government before enlisting. Three landlord families, Liu, Chen, and Song, in the village had requested to join the army, but were rejected by the masses. The young people who joined the army regarded defending the land and opposing Chiang Kai-shek's traitorous dictatorship as the supreme glory. Their level of awareness made the comrades of the training corps feel ashamed and say, "They are not even as good as a new recruit!" After the young people from the village joined the army, they still had to be reviewed by the army. Nine who did not meet the requirements were returned. The remaining 65 new soldiers were all in high spirits, settled down to army life, and none deserted home. The families of those who joined the army were treated preferentially in the village, and land, houses, and all the fruits of struggle were given to them first. Those without labor were cultivated by the mutual aid teams. This practical material was very educational for the training corps. Deng Han and 41 other students used to think: "Voluntarily joining the army is a lie. War means death, who would want to do it!" After this field study, everyone understood that these people were not only not "fools willing to die" but also "smart people seeking survival." For example, among the 113 members of the training corps last year in Andong, 92 did not believe that joining the army in the liberated areas was voluntary, 17 were skeptical, and only 4 believed it. After three months of rectification and this field investigation, no one disbelieved it. Everyone recalled the tragic situation of seeing conscription and mistreatment of new recruits when they were in the Chiang army, and compared it with the voluntary joining of the army by the people in the liberated areas, which made them understand more deeply why the People's Liberation Army always wins battles. Before going to the countryside, 16 students still thought: "The Kuomintang has good weapons and American assistance; although the Communist Party has the support of the people, its weapons are not good, so the war will continue, and no one can eliminate anyone." Now they have also changed their understanding. They said with full confidence in victory: "The new soldiers of the Democratic Allied Forces are so determined, no matter how good the Kuomintang army's weapons are, they will not work." (Note: The Democratic Allied Forces were the former 64th Division of the Chiang army, which was reorganized after an uprising led by General Pan Shuoduan, the division commander, in May of last year.)

　　民主同盟军干训队
  　下乡实地学习
    【新华社东北二十四日电】民主同盟军干部训练队下乡参观解放区参军扰抗情况，对干部启发甚大。据参加的学员王观林谈：训练队在北安县延安村住了十天，目睹全村七十四名参军青年，都是经过本人及家庭自愿，又经区政府的检查方才入伍。该村有刘、陈、宋三家地主曾要求参军，并被群众拒绝，参军青年都以参军保卫土地，反对蒋介石卖国独裁为无尚光荣，其觉悟程度使训练队的同志都惭愧地说：“还不如人家一个新兵呢！”该村参军青年到部队后，还须经部队审查，不合格返回者有九名，其余六十五名新战士情绪均极愉快，安心部队生活，始终无一名开小差回家。参军家属都受村里优待，土地房屋及一切斗争果实都优先分给，无劳力者由代耕队代耕。这一个实际材料，对训练队的教育很大，邓汉等四十一位同学过去认为：“自愿当兵是哄人的鬼话，打仗要死人，谁愿意去干呢！”经过这次下乡学习，大家懂得了这些人不仅不是“愿死的傻子”而且是“求生的聪明人”。又如训练队一百一十三人去年在安东时期不相信解放区参军是自愿的有九十二人，半信半疑的十七人，相信的只有四人。经过三个月整训及此次下乡实地调查，不相信的已无一人，大家回忆自己在蒋军时目睹抓捕壮丁，虐待新兵的惨状，与解放区人民自愿参军相对比，更深刻了解了解放军为什么老打胜仗。下乡前曾有十六个同学还认为：“国民党武器好，又有美国帮助；共产党虽然有人民拥护，但是武器不好，所以战争一直要打下去，谁也消灭不了谁。”现在也改变了认识，他们充满胜利信心地说：“民主联军新战士都是这样坚决，国民党军队武器再好也不顶事。”（按：民主同盟军为前蒋军六四师，去年五月在该师师长潘朔端将军领导下起义改编而成。）
