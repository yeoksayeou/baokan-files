From our correspondent in Licheng: On the night of July 27th, the masses of Zizhen Township held an early celebration of the Party and Army's birthday. Emancipated peasants recalled the happy life that the Party and Army had given them over the past ten years. Peasant Jin Congshan said, "I am an outsider. In the past, I had to join the well cooperative to get water and pay six silver dollars, or I couldn't even get water. Since the Eighth Route Army came, my social status has improved. In the emancipation movement last year, I got nine mu of land and a black donkey. The Eighth Route Army is really my savior." Yang Deshun said, "My wife revealed that the landlord's money was not enough to pay the interest of the long-term workers every year. The landlord mortgaged the land and couldn't live on it, so he went to dig slopes. After the Eighth Route Army came, he redeemed five mu of land. This year, he turned over. In the past, the more I talked, the more bitter I was, but now the more I talk, the happier I am." Dozens of peasants competed to talk about their personal interests and unanimously said that we should produce well, respect our families, and increase grain production to celebrate the birthday of the Party and Army. Each mutual aid group immediately set out a five-day plan. When it rained heavily, they seized the time to replant late crops, sowing a total of 150 mu of buckwheat and 23 mu of vegetables, and completed the first hoeing of millet and 38 mu of corn, repairing cotton fields and hoeing twice for 76 mu, and women completed more than 150 jin of cloth in five days, exchanging rice for more than 90 dan as food for the famine. Men and women put forward mutual aid competition. The results were summarized on the afternoon of August 1st. (Lü Duan, Shi Shun, Jian Xun, Shan Ji, Jin Tang, Shi Rong)

Also: On the evening of July 29th, Xiwu Village held a mass meeting to commemorate "August 1st." Hua Benkuan, the director of civil affairs, said, "When drinking water, don't forget the well digger, and when turning over, don't forget the Eighth Route Army. Today, to commemorate August 1st, I want to sow autumn vegetables and buckwheat for the families of soldiers and martyrs first. Our mutual aid group will also hoe five more mu of land for the military families, and I will be responsible for checking and doing a good job in the village's support work for the military." Then many people proposed to replant and hoe more land for the military families first, and ensure that the work of supporting the military is done well. Women proposed to strengthen textile production and sew vests and comfort bags for the army. After the masses expressed their feelings, seven model military family members such as Zhang Xiaomei, six model military supporters such as Li Renshu, and three model retired soldiers such as Han Lulin were selected. After the meeting, statistics showed that a total of 51 mu of land were proposed to be hoeed more for the military families, and women sewed 23 vests and 11 comfort bags. (Fan Renqing)

Also: The masses of Nanbu Village gathered on July 28th to discuss using practical work to welcome August 1st. Because it rained heavily in Nanbu area that day, the brigade discussed and set out a ten-day production plan to go all out to replant and protect seedlings. From the 29th, in the first three days, they will complete the replanting of 85 mu of late crops such as buckwheat, 153 mu of autumn vegetables, and in the last seven days, they will carry out the first hoeing and seedling selection of late millet and corn, the third hoeing of cotton seedlings, and the other will complete the second hoeing, and combine the plowing of the wheat fields twice.

    【本报黎城讯】七月二十七日夜，子镇群众提前举行党军诞生节纪念，翻身农民回忆十余年来党军所给予自己的幸福生活，农民靳从善说：“我是一个外来户，从前吃水还得入井社，出银洋六元，不然就连水都不能吃了。自从八路军来后，我社会地位提高，在去年翻身运动中，我又得到了土地九亩，黑驴一头，八路军真是我的救命星。”杨得顺说：“我说老婆揭了地主钱，年年住长工不够打利钱，地主押了地无法生活去刨坡地，八路军来了后，又赎回地五亩，今年又翻身，过去是越说越苦，现在我是越说越高兴。”几十个农民争谈个人的利益，一致说我们要好好生产，尊敬家属，增产粮食来给党军做生日。各互助组当即订出五天计划，适遇透雨，抓紧时间补种晚作物，共撒荞麦一百五十亩，撒菜二十三亩，全部完成头锄谷，奶玉茭三十八亩，修理棉花赶锄二锄，打顶脱裤七十六亩，妇女五天完成一百五十余斤布，换米九十余石，作为渡荒食粮。男女互助提出竞赛。八一下午总结成绩。（履端、时顺、建勋、善继、锦堂、世荣、）
