Xinhua News Agency, Jinji-Luyu, August 12th: Since July, the Chiang Kai-shek and puppet troops in northern Henan have been compressed into several isolated cities such as Anyang, Jiaozuo, and Xinxiang. On the evening of July 4th, the People's Liberation Army launched the Daokou-Qinghua Railway offensive, and within half a month, recovered five county towns including Bo'ai, Qinyang, Mengxian, Wuzhi, and Xiuwu (later voluntarily withdrew), as well as dozens of large and small strongholds such as Daiwang Town, eliminating 4,800 enemies (including 1,170 killed or wounded and 3,663 captured). Vast areas of land were recovered, covering an area of 3,500 square li, increasing the population by 350,000 and cultivated land by 500,000 mu. On the 22nd of last month, a regiment of the 38th Division of the Chiang Kai-shek army from the isolated island of Jiaozuo ventured out to probe, and more than 60 of them were immediately eliminated, and they hurriedly shrank back into their nests. To cooperate with this victory, the local armed forces in northern Henan, in conjunction with the people, launched the "Three Protections Movement" of protecting grain, manpower, and livestock, and started a mass guerrilla war. The militia and work teams and the masses around Anyang City formed a 40-li-long siege line, active near the city, causing the enemy to be attacked everywhere by sniper fire, landmines, captures, and ambushes. According to incomplete statistics, there have been more than 200 battles in the past month, killing or wounding 96 Chiang Kai-shek and puppet troops, capturing 46 Chiang Kai-shek soldiers and more than 330 local bullies and despots who had returned to their villages, and recovering 79 villages. The county formed three forward headquarters to organize the rear militia to support the front, vigorously carried out political offensives, and widely conducted patriotic competition within the militia work teams. They did not eat the people's food in the villages they went to, returned the things looted by the enemy and puppets to the people, and helped the masses to cultivate when they had time, which won the enthusiastic support of the masses. Yexian County (newly established county) in the southeast of Anyang established the North and South Command Headquarters to organize newly emancipated peasants to launch a border blasting campaign. In half a month, they killed or wounded more than 40 enemies. According to statistics from four villages in the liberated area, more than 300 people were arrested. The emancipated masses in the east of Tangyin, after half a month of arduous struggle, have completely crushed the remnants of the giant bandit Si Huasheng, who had ruled the area for more than 30 years. When we advanced to encircle and suppress the bandit's old nest in Yue'erzhai, Duo'erzhai and other villages, our momentum was huge and shocked dozens of villages. The bandit leader Si Zhensheng (Si Huasheng's battalion commander) was so frightened that he hurriedly fled to Anyang City. Armed masses captured more than 100 traitorous bandits and local bullies, and held public trials at mass meetings in various villages. The people were encouraged, and now the masses in the whole county are taking advantage of the momentum to launch a vigorous land reform movement.
