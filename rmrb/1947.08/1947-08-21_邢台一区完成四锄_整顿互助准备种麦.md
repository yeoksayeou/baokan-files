　　【Our Newspaper Reporter Group, 19th Dispatch】Xingtai First District (New District) has generally completed its fourth weeding, and the autumn harvest is only half a month away. The district recently convened a meeting of village cadres and mutual aid team leaders to study the autumn harvest and wheat planting work. The meeting revealed that many villages have become complacent due to the good growth of crops this year, leading to laxity in mutual aid. To ensure the success of the autumn harvest and wheat planting, district leaders proposed rectifying existing mutual aid groups and absorbing more labor. Taking advantage of the agricultural slack, they are calling for opening up wasteland and cultivating field edges, preparing fertilizer, and urging village cadres to make contributions during the autumn harvest and wheat planting. Daliangzhuang, Fandian, and other six villages immediately challenged Zhangjiazhuang, with the competition conditions being: fully organize before the autumn harvest, eliminate all mature wasteland, and weed the field edges clean. After the meeting, Zhangjiazhuang completed weeding all the field edges in the village within two days and dispatched two teams to the city to sweep manure and buy fertilizer. On the afternoon of the 14th, as soon as the heavy rain stopped, the entire village immediately mobilized to open up wasteland. Daliangzhuang has also opened up more than ten mu of wasteland. Regarding the expansion of mutual aid groups, Zhangjiazhuang organized 90% of the village's labor force; Beichendian developed from two groups to fourteen groups; and Xijingzhuang expanded from two groups to eleven groups. In just a few days, the entire district has organized 50% to 70% of the total labor force. Mutual aid in each village is continuing to develop and expand. (Juzhu, Wankui)
　　【Our Newspaper Reporter Group, 19th Dispatch】In many villages in Xingtai where it rained early, the autumn seedlings have been weeded four times, and the hoes have been hung up. Farmers are taking advantage of this agricultural break to organize forces and launch a concentrated effort to open up wasteland in preparation for wheat planting. According to incomplete statistics from 162 villages, 8,741 mu of wasteland have been opened up. Hewu Village used accounting methods to get the farmers to understand: opening up wasteland provides firewood and increases grain production. On average, opening up one mu of wasteland requires four workdays, and the wheat planted is exempt from public grain, resulting in a net profit of 12,000 yuan per mu. The masses all said, "The profit is great!" The Fourth Mutual Aid Group in the village launched a concentrated effort to open up 16 mu of wasteland. The village head of Dalü Village led the entire village in a wasteland opening competition, and he personally opened up more than four mu. The four mutual aid groups in Pangma Village, with 25 laborers, opened up a total of 220 mu of wasteland. They said, "Opening up wasteland for farming is tax-free for five years, a one-time investment for permanent gain, what are we waiting for?" Sixty-three villages in the First District have opened up more than 1,500 mu of wasteland, ensuring that all wasteland will be completely opened up and planted with wheat before the wheat planting season. Farmers in the eastern half of the Fifth District proposed "opening up wasteland to fill the holes," striving to plant more wheat to compensate for the poor harvest. All the women in Dajia Township opened up two mu of wasteland each. In the Second District, the two mutual aid groups led by Yang Laohai and Wang Renbao in Shixiang Village led their members to open up more than 100 mu of wasteland after weeding the seedlings. The nine mutual aid groups in Kongqiao Village opened up more than 150 mu of wasteland in four days; the farmers in the village believe that the wasteland in their village is not enough and have requested the leadership to negotiate with Louxia Village to open up their wasteland.

  　整顿互助准备种麦
    【本报记者团十九日电】邢台一区（新区）已普遍锄完四遍，再有半月就要收秋。该区日前召开了村干部及互助组长会议，研究秋收种麦工作。会上发现不少村庄因今年庄稼长的好，发生严重自满，对互助懒散下来。区领导上为了把秋收及种麦作好，提出整顿原有互助，吸收更多劳力参加。现乘农闲要开荒耕地边草，准备肥料，并号召各村干部在秋收种麦中立功。大梁庄、范店等六村，当即向张家庄挑战，竞赛条件是：秋收之前，全面组织起来，消灭所有熟荒，锄净地边草。会后张家庄二日内即将全村地边草锄完，并分出两组去城里扫粪，买粪。十四日下午大雨初停，全体立即出动开荒。大梁庄现亦开荒十余亩。扩大互助组方面，张家庄组织了全村劳动力的百分之九十；北陈店由二组发展到十四组；西净庄由二组扩大到十一组。几天光景，全区已组织起全劳动力的百分之五十到七十。现各村互助正继续发展扩大中。（聚珠、万魁）
