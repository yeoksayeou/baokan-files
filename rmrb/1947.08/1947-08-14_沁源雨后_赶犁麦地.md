　　Qinyuan After the Rain
  　Hurrying to Plow Wheat Fields
    [Report from our Taiyue Office on the 11th] After rain fell in Qinyuan on the 28th of last month, widespread efforts were made to rush-plant and replant, and hurry to plow wheat fields. Five days ago, seven natural villages including Shuiyu had already rushed to plow 1,210 mu of wheat fields and rush-planted 2,450 mu of late autumn crops. Mutual aid teams such as those of Han Hong, Yang Zhang, etc., rushed to plant 165 mu and plowed over 40 mu of wheat fields in just two days, the 31st and 1st. Currently, the majority of the county has completed rush-planting and plowing. It is estimated that this year, wheat fields can be increased by one-half. During the rush-planting, Dongjia Village overcame the erroneous idea of not saving on resources for preparedness against famine after the rain. Under the leadership of the chairman of the federation, the whole village planted 68.6 mu of vegetables. Siyi Village researched a method of intercropping, planting 70 mu of late vegetables on land where seedlings were incomplete, and plans to intercrop 120 mu of wheat in the vegetable plots when planting wheat. In Nangou, under the promotion of Wu Fuze, the chairman of the Farmers' Association, 53 mu of buckwheat and autumn vegetables were rush-planted.
    [Report from our reporter team on the 12th] Farmers in the Shahe New District are taking advantage of breaks from weeding to actively plow wasteland and rush-plant buckwheat and autumn vegetables. When the Japanese invaders occupied Shahe, they created a large amount of wasteland. Last year, the land reform was in full swing, and the masses did not have time to eliminate all the wasteland. This year, reduced harvests are certain, and after planting all cultivated land, the leadership called on people to plow wasteland and rush-plant buckwheat and autumn vegetables, with whoever plants reaping the harvest, and no burden imposed. Villages are responding enthusiastically. Nanwang organized the entire village labor force to rush-plant 230 mu in half a day, and Nanyang has already planted 405 mu. Qingjie Village has a total of 3,000 mu of wasteland, and this year it will all be planted with buckwheat and vegetables. Although there are no overall statistics for the county yet, it is estimated that at least 30,000 to 40,000 mu can be planted, which will play a significant role in this year's production and preparedness against famine. The enthusiastic development of this vegetable planting movement is largely due to the leading role of cadres. At the end of last month, after a thorough rain, some masses developed a paralyzing thought, feeling that "the famine is not very important anymore." Many people were also afraid of bearing burdens, saying, "What we plant is not enough for the public." The leadership emphasized that cadres should take the lead. Zhang Lu, the village chief of Ge Village, with only two people in his household, was the first to plant 1.7 mu, prompting his team of 104 people to quickly plant 27 mu. Other teams followed suit, and the whole village planted 300 mu the next day. Seeing the cadres planting, the masses said, "They are still so active, we must not be paralyzed." "Everyone is planting, so there probably won't be any burdens." The movement then developed rapidly. (Li Zhuang)

　　沁源雨后
  　赶犁麦地
    【本报太岳十一日电】沁源上月二十八日落雨后，普遍进行抢种补种，赶犁麦地。水峪等七个自然村五日前即赶犁麦地一二一○亩，抢种晚秋二四五○亩。韩洪杨张等互助组，在三十一、一日两天中，就抢种一六五亩，赶犁麦地四十余亩，现全县大部抢种赶犁完毕，预计今年可增加麦田二分之一，董家村在抢种中，曾克服了雨后不用节约备荒的错误思想，在联合会主席领导下，全村种菜六十八亩六分，四义村研究出套种办法，在苗不全的地上套种晚菜七十亩，并计划种麦时，蓝地内套种麦子一二○亩，南沟在农会主席武符则推动下，抢种荞麦秋菜五三亩。
    【本报记者团十二日电】沙河新区农民，正乘锄苗间隙，积极犁荒，抢种荞麦、秋菜，日寇侵踞沙河时，曾造成大量荒地，去年土地改革热火朝天，群众没有来得及将荒地全部消灭，今年减收已定，领导上在全部耕地下种后，即号召犁荒，抢种荞麦秋菜，谁种谁收，不出负担，各村纷纷响应。南汪组织全村劳力，半天抢种二百卅亩，南阳已下种四○五亩。青芥村，共有荒地三千亩，今年要全部种上荞麦和菜。全县虽尚无整个统计，估计最少可种三、四万亩，在今年生产备荒中，将起极大作用。此次种菜运动开展热烈，干部带头是最重要原因之一，上月底，落透雨后，若干群众滋长麻痹思想，觉得“灾荒不很要紧了。”也有许多人害怕出负担，说：“种了还不够公家的”。领导上乃强调干部带头，葛村村长张禄，只两口人，首先种了一亩七分，推动全组一百零四人很快种了二十七亩，别组跟着行动起来，第二天全村就种了三百亩。群众看见干部种，就说：“人家还这么积极，咱们更不能麻痹。”“人家都种，大概没有负担。”运动遂迅速发展起来。　（李庄）
