　　Followed the Formation,
  　Became a Prisoner
    [This newspaper, Taiyue, 12th] When the Chiang army's direct line 248th Regiment was annihilated in Pinglu, one of its companies was tasked with covering the retreat. Its company commander, Dong Xianchen, painstakingly arranged the entire company into a defensive formation according to defensive tactics, including concealed sentries, military sentries, small sentries, left front, right depth, etc. Our pursuing troops were already 50 meters away from this position, but the enemy had not yet fired. Their soldiers were trembling with fear, while Company Commander Dong was acting according to the rule of "defensive companies are not allowed to fire first."

    After a burst of intense grenade explosions, the enemy platoon leader reported to the company commander: "The front line has been breached by the enemy (referring to our army), and the troops are in chaos!" Company Commander Dong was at a loss and hurriedly took out a book, preparing to read it. Our army's bayonets were already flashing before their eyes, shouting: "Surrender your guns!" At this moment, Dong Xianchen was terrified and shouted loudly, "Surrender! Surrender!" After the soldiers surrendered their weapons, Company Commander Dong, holding the "Infantry Combat Regulations" approved by the Military Commission, became a prisoner. Such is the ability of Chiang's army officers and soldiers.

　　按照阵法
  　当了俘虏
    【本报太岳十二日电】蒋军嫡系二四八团在平陆被歼时，该团一连担任了掩护退却的任务，其连长董先臣耗精费神的按照防御的阵法，如潜伏哨、军事哨、小哨、左前沿，右纵深等，把全连排成一个防御阵势，我追击部队已离这个阵地五十公尺了，敌人尚未发射。他们的士兵们吓的正在发抖，而董连长则接照“防御之连，不准先敌开火”的规则行事。
    当一阵激烈的手榴弹爆炸后，敌排长向连长报告：“前沿被敌（指我军）突破，部队已混乱！”董连长束手无策，忙掏出一本书来，准备阅看，我军的刺刀已闪在他们眼前，喊着：“缴枪”！董先臣此时吓得魂不付体，也扬臂大喊：“缴枪！缴枪！”士兵缴械后，董连长手中拿着那本军事委员会审定之“步兵战斗条例”当了俘虏。蒋军官兵的本领如此而已。
