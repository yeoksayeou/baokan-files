　　【Report from Pingding by this newspaper】The masses in Donghui Village, due to the complete lack of rain during the entire summer season, suffered from the withering of most of their crops. They said, "We want to go out and gather some firewood, but we lack money. Without capital, we can't do anything." After the cooperative heard this feedback from the masses, they discussed establishing a credit department with Comrade Li Fenglin from the bank and the village chief. However, the masses did not deposit any money because: 1. They were afraid that earning interest on deposits was exploitation. 2. They were afraid that if they deposited grain, they would not be able to withdraw it in case of emergency. 3. Special agents spread rumors saying, "Farmers all over the world are one family, eating up one family after another. Depositing money and grain is registration!" The masses were frightened. After mobilizing them in the people's school, repeatedly explaining the role of the credit department in absorbing idle funds and organizing production to overcome the famine, clarifying the difference between production and exploitation, and stipulating that deposits and withdrawals were completely free, and that after two months they could also be used as cooperative shares for dividends, the rumors of the special agents were finally exposed. This inspired confidence in self-reliance through production. Under the leadership of the cadres, the next day, 15 shi and 2 dou of wheat, 2 dou of corn, and 15,000 yuan in silver dollars were deposited. The cooperative also allocated 100,000 yuan as credit funds and immediately lent them to the masses, organizing them to carry out transport by shoulder pole. The masses happily spread the word about how good the cooperative was. The news reached the neighboring villages of Mashan, Madita, Qianhuang'an, Xihui, and Zhao Village, and their cooperatives also established credit departments to organize the masses to overcome the famine and engage in production.

　　东回合作社适应群众需要
  　成立信用部组织生产
    【本报平定讯】东回村群众，因整个伏天无雨，庄稼大部旱死，都说：“想出外面拾些砍，但是手里缺钱，有力无本啥也干不成”。合作社听到群众这种反映后，便和银行李凤林同志及村长讨论好成立信用部。可是群众没有人存款。因为：一、怕存款得利是剥削。二、怕存进粮食急吃时拿不出来。三、特务造谣说：“天下农民是一家，吃干一家吃一家。存款存粮是登记哩！”群众害了怕。经过在民校上动员，反复说明信用部吸收游资、组织生产渡荒的作用，解释清生产与剥削的区别，规定存抽完全自由，两个月以上还可做为合作社股金分红。最后揭穿特务的谣言，启发了生产自救的信心，在干部带头下，第二天即存到麦子十五石二斗、玉茭二斗、大洋一万五千元。合作社又抽出十万元作信用资金，当即分别贷给群众，组织起来出外担挑运输。群众高兴的到处说合作好，消息传到邻近的马山、麻地塔、前黄安、西会、赵家庄五个村合作社，也都成立了信用部，组织群众渡荒生产。（肇全、一安）
