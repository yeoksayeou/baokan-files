Xinhua News Agency, Northeast, 16th: In the land reform movement of Yanshou County, Songjiang Province, liberated peasants dug out the roots of evil, uncovering several bandit leaders including Chiang bandit Division Commander Wang Xingwu (Wang Xingwu’s original name was Wang Hongsheng). During the puppet Manchukuo regime, Wang was a Japanese spy. After the fall of the puppet Manchukuo regime, he was appointed as Division Commander of the 15th Army by Chiang Kai-shek’s “National Government Military Council” and lay dormant in the areas of Harbin, Zhuhe, Yanshou, and Fangzheng. He used feudal superstitious groups to organize more than twenty bandit gangs of varying sizes, such as the "Wang Wansheng" gang, to harass various places east of Harbin. Last June, he gathered more than 1,200 bandits from all gangs in Yanshou, attempting to capture Yanshou City, but was defeated by our army. Wang then fled to Mudanjiang City, disguised as a peddler, and secretly engaged in activities, attempting to rise again. On the 25th of last month, he was discovered by liberated peasants of Yanshou County in cooperation with liberated masses in the urban area of Mudanjiang City. They immediately led the Public Security Forces of Mudanjiang City overnight to arrest Wang, confiscating five appointment certificates and one order from Chiang Kai-shek, and uncovering sixteen bandit leaders of varying sizes, including a "regimental commander". On the same day, the streets of Yanshou were filled with blackboards announcing the good news, and the liberated peasants were jubilant.

　　东北延寿群众挖坏根
  　蒋匪师长王兴武落网
    【新华社东北十六日电】松江延寿县翻身农民挖坏根运动中，挖出蒋匪师长王兴武（王逆原名王鸿胜）等匪首多名。伪满时王逆充当日寇特务，伪满倒台后被蒋记“国民政府军事委员会”委为十五集团军师长潜伏于哈尔滨、珠河、延寿、方正一带，利用封建迷信团体，组织“王万升”等大小二十余股匪，窜扰哈东各地，去年六月曾啸聚延寿所有股匪一千二百名，企图攻占延寿城，旋经我军击溃，王逆即潜逃牡丹江市，伪装小贩秘密活动，企图再起。上月二十五日为延寿翻身农民协同牡丹江市城关翻身群众发现，即星夜带领牡市公安部队将王逆逮捕，并缴获蒋贼委任状五份及训令一纸，并挖出“团长”以下大小匪首十六名。当日延寿街头黑板报上大书捷报，翻身农民莫不欢庆。
