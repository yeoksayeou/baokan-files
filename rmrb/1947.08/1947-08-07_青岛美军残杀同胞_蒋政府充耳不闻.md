    Qingdao: American Troops Brutally Kill Compatriots
    Chiang Government Turns a Deaf Ear
    [Xinhua News Agency, Shandong, 5th] According to a compilation of Qingdao newspaper reports: Following the unreasonable shooting of our fellow ice cream vendor Chen Lupu by American troops on June 30th, in the past month, they have continuously brutally killed five more of our compatriots. Among them was a 74-year-old vendor, Wang Desheng, who was shot and killed near the American military camp on the 5th of last month. He died without money for a proper burial, leaving behind an old wife and young children in a most miserable state. Because the Chiang government is obsequious to foreigners and sells out the country, it turns a deaf ear to these blood debts, allowing the American military authorities to indulge and protect the perpetrators. As a result, the American murderers still remain at large, and the names and families of four of our killed compatriots are unknown. The corpses of two of them, after being brutally killed, were left in the municipal hospital morgue for several days and have already decomposed.

    青岛美军残杀同胞
    蒋政府充耳不闻
    【新华社山东五日电】综合青岛报纸消息：青岛美军继六月三十日无理枪杀我卖冰棍同胞陈禄平后，过去一月来又连续残杀我同胞五人，内有一年已七十四岁之摊贩王德胜，于上月五日在美军兵营附近被枪杀，死后无钱收殓，遗下老妻幼子，状至凄惨。由于蒋政府媚外卖国，对此等血债不闻不问，任由美军当局纵容包庇，致美军凶手至今仍逍遥法外，而我被杀同胞四人甚至连姓名及家属亦无从获悉。内有二人被惨杀后，历时数日尚置市立医院太平间内，尸体业已腐烂。
