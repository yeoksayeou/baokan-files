    Mutual Aid Irrigation, Cooperative Grain Distribution
    Mutual Aid Protects Seedlings in the Second District of Licheng
    [Our Newspaper, Licheng News] Villages such as Qiaogou Village, Dongbei, and Chen Village are mutually aiding in irrigating seedlings and uniformly distributing dividends. Qiaogou Village has land not far from the water source, but the people cannot manage to irrigate it all. Zhu Wenkui and Shen Fengwen, two heroes from Dongbei and Chen Village, proposed that irrigating the seedlings is most urgent, but unfortunately, our village has no water, and some people cannot irrigate their seedlings. Everyone jointly studied and came up with the following methods: (1) Labor and seedling land are pooled for grain distribution. Dongbei and Chen Village lack water, so they organized 361 male and female auxiliary laborers to carry water to irrigate 413 mu of land near the water source in Qiaogou, Renzhuang Dongwa, and Xiwa villages. In addition to the labor of the above four villages irrigating their own land, they allocated distant land to Chen Village and Dongbei for irrigation. (2) The method of grain distribution for seedling land and labor is based on the proportion of labor and seedling land used. If it only needs irrigating once or twice before it rains, the labor only receives one-tenth to two-tenths of the total income. If it needs irrigating five times, each receives half, and if the seedlings are completely saved by carrying water, the seedling land only receives two-tenths at the autumn harvest. There are different regulations based on the distance to the water source, and the same method applies to both villagers and outsiders. (3) Employ the method of equal labor, unequal value, labor exchange, and rotational irrigation (referring to the villagers). (4) For seedling rescue techniques, use the method of breaking the soil, digging pits, and "stealth irrigation," burying the pits with soil after irrigation to absorb moisture and nutrients to aid growth, while also ensuring they are not burned to death by the sun. At the time, statistics showed that each village could irrigate 487 mu of land themselves, and by adjusting seedling land and labor to rescue and distribute grain, the seven villages irrigated an additional 1,032 mu of seedlings. Currently, 874 male laborers, 504 female laborers, and 162 male and female auxiliary laborers, totaling 1,540 laborers, have all participated in this movement. (Shun Qing, Guang Bei, Shu Ling)

    互助浇地  合伙分粮
    黎城二区互助护苗
    【本报黎城讯】桥沟村、董北、陈村等村，互助浇苗，统一分红。桥沟村有地离水不远，人赶不过来不能浇完。董北陈村祝文魁、申逢文二个英雄提出当紧得浇苗，可惜我村没有水，有人不能浇苗。大家共同研究想出如下办法：（１）劳力、苗地合伙分粮。董北、陈村缺水，组织起男女辅助劳力共三百六十一个人到桥沟、仁庄东洼、西洼等村离水近地有四百一十三亩担水去浇，以上四村除自己劳力浇外，抽出远地交给陈村、董北去浇。（２）苗地劳力分粮办法以劳力苗地用工比重分粮。如只浇一两次就下了雨，劳力只分总收入十分之一至二成。如浇五次即各分半数，完全是担水救下，秋收时苗地只分二成。按水远近各有规定，不论本村外村同样办法。（３）运用等工不等价，工变工，轮流浇法（指本村）。（４）救苗技术用水破圊刨坑偷浇办法，浇后用土埋坑，能吸收水分，和养料扶助生长，又保证不怕日光腾死。当时统计各村能自己浇地四百八十七亩，调剂苗地劳力抢救分粮者，七个村多浇苗一千零三十二亩。现已组织男劳力八百七十四人，女劳力五百零四人，男女辅助劳力一百六十二人，总共劳力一千五百四十个，都参加了这一运动。（顺庆、光北、书令）
