　　Art and the Countryside
　　Zhao Shuli

　　At the recent literary and art symposium in the Border Region, in addition to proposing the "Zhao Shuli direction," the issue of rural literary and art movements was also touched upon. However, due to insufficient preparation, in-depth discussions could not be fully展开. Therefore, after the meeting, comrades Zhao Shuli and Wang Yaping were specially invited to write articles expressing their views. We sincerely hope that literary and art workers from various regions will contribute and participate in the discussion.

　　If we acknowledge that art is spiritual nourishment, then it is as indispensable as material food. Art activities in the countryside are as normal as eating; the fact that rural art activities are somewhat rudimentary is simply a matter of course – if one can't afford meat, one has to settle for millet.

　　Historically, not only did generations of scholarly landlord families indulge in their music, chess, calligraphy, and painting after tea and wine, and local despots display glass-paneled scrolls all over their houses to flaunt their wealth to the oppressed, but even the oppressed, whose stomachs were not yet filled with material food, would seize the opportunity to sneak into temples to watch night operas. This is enough to show that the universal artistic needs of rural people have been there since ancient times. After the broad masses of people turned over, everyone had land. This land can not only grow crops, but also grow art. Because everyone has land, they no longer need to beg for material food, and their demand for spiritual food has also increased, so their art activities have also increased.

　　Rural art activities have their old traditions. After turning over, the masses inherited some things from these traditions, and at the same time added their own creations, which constitute the new art activities at this stage.

　　From what I have seen, the greatest achievements are in drama and yangko dance. Almost every large village has a theatrical troupe, and yangko, in certain seasons, is performed in almost all villages, large and small. Traditionally, these two forms of entertainment were looked down upon by landlords and unaffordable for the poor. They were often hosted by the rich peasant class and participated in by the middle peasant class. The performances, in terms of content and form, were thoroughly old-fashioned, simply for their own amusement. After the masses turned over, they naturally wanted to have some fun, but in the countryside, the most inclusive collective entertainment still counts these two forms of performance, so they squeezed into these two groups. However, the newly liberated masses felt a little awkward with these two forms of entertainment – first, they wanted to sing praises of themselves and were not very interested in ancient people and stories; second, although those old scenes and tunes looked familiar, it was still quite difficult to learn them, and they felt uncomfortable being bound by those conventions. In this case, they boldly reformed these two things – breaking the rules of old operas and old yangko dances, and using free language and movements to perform realistic content. The things that came out of this approach were not only unfulfilling for those who understood art, but even the people in the village who had learned this way, while participating in it, also shook their heads repeatedly, sighing "the present is not as good as the past". Regardless of how dissatisfied these people were, this new opera and new yangko continued to operate as usual, and developed rapidly. From the overall perspective of each of their works, although most of them are inevitably unsuccessful, almost all of them have their own unique features, and these unique features are almost all unimaginable to us.

　　The tradition of rural music is the same as that of drama and yangko, but the current stage of achievement is worse. In the countryside, self-entertaining wind and percussion groups, although named differently such as "Bayin Society" and "Ten Styles of Brocade", are essentially "wind and percussion". Historically, they were also looked down upon by landlords and unaffordable for the poor, and could only be done by rich peasants leading middle peasants. Although the masses have also taken it over after they turned over, they do not have the patience to learn fine playing, and can only beat gongs and drums.

　　Related to music is song: although folk songs have existed in this regard in history, and some people have used them, it cannot be said that it is the development of folk songs. Rural folk songs are the property of the rural proletariat, but most of them are hummed love songs. Not only do the singers think that they cannot be put on a grand stage, but even if they are forced to be put on, they are not dignified. Therefore, in the past, they could not be sung in public occasions. However, ordinary people have the urge to "sing", and when there is nothing to sing in history, they sing a few lines of local old opera to vent their anger. Since the War of Resistance, comrades working in music have composed some anti-Japanese songs, filling this historical void, thus opening up the trend of singing in the countryside. After the masses turned over, this trend developed further, almost everyone, young and old, male and female, sang at all times and in all places. When they encountered comrades working in the countryside, they asked them to teach them some new songs. Unfortunately, the supply in this area was too small, so that some people took the songs of locust control to the wedding meeting to sing. In addition, there has also been great development in folk songs, especially when used in drama.

　　In terms of books, the masses also have demands: after the masses turned over, they had tables, and there were also vases and mirrors on the tables, and there were also calligraphy and paintings on the walls. They do not feel satisfied with those old traditional calligraphy and paintings (or it can be said that they do not have those elegant interests), and in order not to forget the Communist Party, they also like to hang several portraits of Chairman Mao, Commander-in-Chief Zhu De, Deputy Commander-in-Chief Peng Dehuai and other leaders in the middle. When they can't buy them, people who like to write and draw draw them themselves. These paintings are often drawn like human figures, but it is difficult to determine who they look like. Originally, it was a portrait of Chairman Mao, and below it was written Commander-in-Chief Zhu, but others could not see it. After posting these portraits in the middle, they also hung some dragon and phoenix happy couplets that they did not know when or who got married.

　　In terms of poetry, there is a large blank: the new and old poems of various styles that have been established in the cultural world are fundamentally dead in the current countryside, and although the new and old folk songs, ballads, and quick stories have a strong poetic flavor, they are not good poems after all. At present, works such as "Wang Gui and Li Xiangxiang" and "The Trap" (the latter published in the literary and art magazine compiled by the Taihang Federation of Literary and Art Circles) can indeed fill this blank, but the output is still small, and everyone still needs to write more.

　　Finally, talking about novels: the new novels since the May Fourth Movement, like new poetry, have not taken root in the countryside at all; although old novels (including drum lyrics) have ruled the minds of peasants for many years, causing no small negative consequences, their influence has been diluted by the artillery fire in the ten-year war. Now, in this respect, there is also a remarkable blank.

　　All of this (or there may be more, but there is no need to list them all), except for the blanks, the remaining things that have been activated, no matter how absurd they are, must be recognized as belonging to the scope of art. With so many achievements, so many shortcomings, and so many blanks, what attitude should we workers in art positions take towards this? Judging from the phenomenon of this activity, it is really difficult to be satisfactory, but if we express dissatisfaction to them, we will be in an awkward position, because since we are in this position, people will pass this "dissatisfaction" account to our name.

　　The task of serving the masses is affirmed, and our work posts are temporarily determined. Then our main business is to "meet the artistic requirements of the masses." Therefore, it requires the comrades of our various art departments (except those who directly serve the soldiers in the front) to go to the countryside to investigate and study various art activities, and make partial summaries by period and region as much as possible, and then, based on the achievements obtained and their own cultivation, mass-produce works to make up for the deficiencies and blanks in rural art activities.

　　The types of art that the countryside needs are so many and the quantity is so large that sometimes they exceed our imagination. Publishing a magazine, issuing a book or newspaper, or establishing a theatrical troupe can easily be widely known by people in the cultural worker circle, but when it is taken to the countryside, it is often like a drop in the ocean. Just think, in the Jin-Ji-Lu-Yu Border Region, if each family of turned-over masses wants to buy five New Year pictures from you, how much paper do you have to prepare? Every county needs how many drama cadres as instructors for a rural theatrical troupe? At this time when manpower is insufficient, even if the comrades in the art circles in the rear are all mobilized to invest in the countryside, they can only do a little bit, a drop at a time. How dare they hesitate any longer?

　　It is naturally not impossible to create some more advanced works for people with higher cultural levels, but before the greater task, this can only be regarded as a side business, like a silk shop selling a few silk handkerchiefs as a sideline. Selling too much will take up more necessary capital. As for whether investing in rural work will gradually reduce one's own artistic level, I think it will not happen as long as the attitude is serious. If one thinks in the concept that it is not worth taking out all one's abilities to make things for the masses, then it is naturally inappropriate. Even if it is to write about the movement to turn over for the masses, why wouldn't it be necessary to accept the strengths of world masterpieces? If the workers weaving silk use all their energy to weave cloth, they will definitely weave better new cloth. Finally, when they weave to the best, they may not be able to lure Miss Paris to buy it.

　　艺术与农村
    赵树理
    此次边区文艺座谈会上，除提出赵树理方向外，并涉及农村文艺运动问题，惟因准备不足，未能深入展开讨论：故会后特约赵树理、王亚平等同志为文各抒所见，深望各地文艺工作者来稿参加研讨。
　　——编者
    　　　　　　
    只要承认艺术是精神食粮的话，那末它也和物质食粮一样，是任何人都不能少的。农村有艺术活动，也正如有吃饭活动一样，本来是很正常的事；至于说农村的艺术活动低级一点，那也是事实，买不来肉自然也只好吃小米。
    在历史上，不但世代书香的老地主们，于茶余酒后要玩弄他们的琴棋书画，一里之王的土老财要挂起满屋子玻璃屏条向被压倒的人们摆摆阔气，就是被压倒的人们，物质食粮虽然还填不满胃口，而有机会也还要偷个空子跑到庙院里去看一看夜戏：这足以说明农村人们艺术要求之普遍是自古而然的。广大的群众翻身以后，大家都有了土地，这土地不但能长庄稼，而且还能长艺术。因为大家有了土地后，物质食粮方面再不用去向人求借，而精神食粮的要求也就提高了一步，因而他们的要术活动也就增多起来。
    农村艺术活动，都有它的旧传统，翻身群众，一方面在这传统上接收了一些东西，一方面又加上了自己的创造，才构成现阶段的新的艺术活动。
    据我所见到的，成绩最大的是戏剧和秧歌。凡是大一点的村子，差不多都有剧团，而秧歌在一定的季节，更是大小村庄差不多都闹的。按传统来讲，这两种玩意，在过去地主看不起，穷人们玩不起，往往是富农层来主持，中农层来参加，所表演的东西，无论在内容上形式上，都彻头彻尾是旧的，只是供他们乐一乐就算。群众翻身以后，自然也不免想乐一乐，可是在农村中，容人最多的集体娱乐，还要数这两种玩意儿，因此就挤到这两种集团里来。可是新翻身的群众，对这两种玩意儿感到有点不得劲——第一他们要求歌颂自己，对古人古事兴趣不高；第二那些旧场旧调看起来虽是老一套，学起来却还颇费工夫，被那些成规一束缚，玩着有点不痛快。在这种情况下，他们便对这两种东西加以大胆的改造——打破了旧戏旧秧歌的规律，用自由地语言动作来表演现实的内容。这种作法出来的东西，不但是懂艺术的看了不过瘾，就是村子里学过这一道的人，虽然一面也参加在里边，一面却也连连摇头，大有“今不如古”之叹。不管这些人怎样不满，而这种新戏新秧歌却照常办公，并且发展得很快。从他们每一个作品的整体看来，虽然大多数难免不成所以，但差不多都有它的独到之处，而这些独到之处又差不多都是我们想象不到的。
    农村的音乐，其传统与戏剧秧歌同，只是现阶段成绩比较坏。在农村中，自乐性质的吹吹打打集团，名义虽有“八音会”“十样锦”等之不同，但其为“吹吹打打”则一，在历史上也是地主看不起，穷人玩不起，只有富农领着中农干的。群众翻身后虽然也把它接收过来，但没有耐性去学细吹细打，只能打一打大锣大鼓。
    与音乐相近的则有歌曲：这方面在历史上虽有小调存在，且也有人利用过，但却不能说就是小调的发展。农村的小调倒是农村无产阶级的东西，不过大都是些哼哼唧唧的情歌，不但是唱的人自以为摆不到天地坛上，就是勉强摆上去也不成个气派，因此在过去就不能在公开的场合去唱。可是一般人都有“唱”的冲动，而历史上没有唱的东西，在实在蹩得吃不住的时候，就唱几句地方旧戏来出出气。抗战以来，作音乐工作的同志们编了一些抗战歌曲，填补了这个历史上的空子，于是就开了农村唱歌之风。群众翻身以后，此风更发展了一步，几乎是男女老少无人不唱，无时无地不唱，碰上个下乡工作的同志便要求教他们些新歌，可惜这方面的供给量太少，以致于有些把打蝗的歌拿到结婚的会上去唱的。此外，在小调方面也有很大的发展，特别是运用在戏剧上。
    在图书方面，群众也有要求：翻了身的群众，有了桌子，桌子上也有了插瓶镜子之类，墙上却也有了字画。他们对那些旧的中堂字画感不到满足（也可以说是没有那些雅兴），并且为了不忘共产党，也都爱在中间挂几张毛主席、朱彭总副司令等领袖像。他们买不到时，好写写画画的人就自己画。这些画往往还画得象个人形，可是你要硬说象谁就很难确定，原来画的是毛主席，下边写上朱总司令，别人也看不出来。把这些画像贴到中间，在旁边还挂上一些不知何时何人结婚的龙凤喜联。
    在诗歌方面，空白很大：文化界立过案的新旧各体诗，在现在的农村中根本算是死的，而新旧小调、歌谣、快板之类，虽然也有浓厚的诗味，但究非好的诗作。目前“王贵与李香香”、“圈套”（后一篇载太行文联编的文艺杂志）这一类作品确可以填补这一空白，但产量还少，仍须大家多写。
    最后谈到小说：五四以来的新小说和新诗一样，在农村中根本没有培活了；旧小说（包括鼓词在内）在历史上虽然统治农民思想有年，造成了不小的恶果，但在十年战争中，已被炮火把它的影响冲淡了，现在说来，在这方面也是个了不起的空白。
    这一切（此外或者还有，但不必尽举了），除了空白以外，其余活动起来的东西，不论它怎样不象话，也得承认是属于艺术范围内的。就那么多的成绩，就那么多的缺点，就那么多的空白，我们在艺术岗位的工作者，对这应取什么态度呢？按这活动的现象说，实在难令人满意，可是我们若向他们表示不满，自己就在不便之处，因为我们既在这岗位上，人家就会把这笔“不满”的账过到我们名下来。
    为大众服务的任务是肯定了的，我们的工作岗位是暂时确定了的，那末我们的主要业务就是“满足大众的艺术要求”，因此就要求我们各个艺术部门的工作同志们（在前方直接为兵服务者除外），分别到农村对各种艺术活动加以调查研究，尽可能分时期按地区作出局部的总结，再根据所得之成绩及自己之素养，大量制成作品，来弥补农村艺术活动的缺陷和空白。
    农村所需要的艺术品，种类之多，数量之大，有时都出乎我们想象之外。办一份杂志，出一份书报，成立一个剧团，作一篇小说，很容易叫文化工作者圈子里边的人普遍知道，可是一拿到农村，往往如沧海一粟，试想就晋冀鲁豫边区这一块地方，每一户翻身群众要买你五张年画，你得准备多少纸张？每一县一个农村剧团的指导人，就需要出多少戏剧干部？在这人力不敷分配的时候，后方艺术界的同志们，即使全体总动员投入农村，也只能是作一点算一点，作一滴算一滴，那里还敢再事踟躅呢？
    为文化程度较高的人制作一些更高级的作品，自然也没有什么不可，不过在更伟大的任务之前，这只能算是一种副业，和花布店里捎带卖几条绸手绢一样，贩得多了是会占去更必要的资本的。至于说投身农村中工作会不会逐渐降低了自己的艺术水平，我以为只要态度严肃一点是不会的。假如在观念上认为给群众作东西是不值得拿出自己的全付本领来，那自然不妥当，即使为了给群众写翻身运动，又何曾不需要接受世界名著之长呢？织绸缎的工人把全付精力用来织布，一定会织出更好的新布，最后织到最好处，也不一定不会引诱得巴黎小姐来买。
