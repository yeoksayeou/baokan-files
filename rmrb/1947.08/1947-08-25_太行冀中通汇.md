　　Taihang and Jizhong Regions to Launch Remittance Service
    [Our Dispatch] In order to facilitate economic exchanges between the masses and neighboring regions, as well as transactions for small and medium-sized businesses, the Taihang Post Office has consulted with the Jizhong Postal Branch Bureau and decided to trial remittance services. However, due to the different currency values between the two regions, the exchange rate is based on the market price to convert the actual amount for cash payment. The post office is not responsible for any profit or loss due to currency exchange rate fluctuations. After several studies, the procedures and systems have been simplified and stabilized, and it has been decided to start the remittance service on September 1st. The remittance fee will be 4% of the amount, according to the regulations for remittance within our border region. All post offices and stations handling remittance services will be able to process this service. The implementation of this service will further strengthen the connection between the two regions and greatly increase convenience for industry and commerce. (Yi Yun)

　　太行冀中通汇
    【本报讯】太行邮局为了便利群众与友邻区的经济往来，及中小商业的交易，特与冀中邮政分局商妥，试办互汇业务，但因两区币制比值不同，在兑换折合上，是以市价折合实数兑付现款，邮局不负币制兑折之损益，经数次研究，手续制度，简便稳固，并决定自九月一日开始通汇，汇费照本边区汇兑之规定为百分之四，所有办理汇兑业务之局站，皆能办理，这一业务之实行，进一步加强了两区的联系，给工商增加很大便利。（一耘）
