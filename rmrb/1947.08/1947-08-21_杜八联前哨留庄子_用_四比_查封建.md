[Taiyue, August 19th] The Liuzhuangzi outpost of the "Du Balian" in Jiyuan used the "Four Comparisons" method last month to investigate feudalism. The village peasant association first focused on poor and hired peasants, calling for expanded organization. The peasant association membership grew from over 40 people to 107, and the women's rescue association membership increased from over 20 to 118. Subsequently, they proposed "Four Comparisons" to investigate feudal remnants: 1. Compare land: Is the land of the landlords who have been struggled against more, better, and closer than ours? 2. Compare property: Are their houses, livestock, and household goods richer than ours? 3. Compare living standards: Is their food and clothing better than ours? 4. Compare political status: Have they lowered their heads to us? The result of the comparison: the landlords Dong Silun and Qi Zhitian have more land and property than us, live better lives than us, and have more prestige than us, which aroused everyone's determination to re-struggle against the landlords. Poor and hired peasants first resolved, saying: If we move a hair on the landlord, he will remember the hatred, we must thoroughly overthrow him and subdue him. Everyone agreed: The struggle must be thorough and the overturning must be complete. The outpouring of grievances began. The poor peasant Li Yunzhang said angrily: "In the past, the landlords and despots demanded rent and money from me, forcing me to flee famine, sell my daughter, and starve my brothers and daughters-in-law to death. Now I must demand their lives, daughters and daughters-in-law!" Everyone said, "Everyone has suffered, and which suffering was not caused by the landlords?" Immediately, the struggle against the landlords Dong Silun, Qi Zhitian, and Qi Ruwen began. Special agent certificates were found in their homes. It turned out that during the past several attacks by the Chiang army, everyone else fled, but these landlords did not, because they were acting as internal spies! The hatred became even greater, and they demanded that Dong Silun, Qi Zhitian, and Qi Ruwen repay the blood debts of the poisoned peasants in the whole village. The heinous despots were retaliated against by the peasants. All the landlords, local bullies, and rich peasants in the village bowed their heads to the peasants, one by one repenting to the peasants and repaying the peasants' blood and sweat debts.

　　杜八联前哨留庄子
  　用“四比”查封建
    【本报太岳十九日电】济源“杜八联”的前哨阵地留庄子，上月中旬用“四比”办法搜查封建，村农会首先以贫雇农为中心，号召扩大组织，农会会员随由四十余人发展为一百零七人，妇救会会员由廿余人增加为一百一十八人。随后提出“四比”搜查封建残余：一比土地，斗争过的地主的土地是否比咱们多、好、近？二比财产，他们的房屋牲口内产是否比咱们富？三比生活，他们的吃穿是否比咱们好？四比政治地位，他们是否向咱们低了头？比较的结果：地主董思论、齐治田土地财产比咱们多，生活比咱们好，脸面比咱大，由此引起大家重新斗争地主的决心。雇贫农首先下定决心，说：动了地主一根毛他记着仇，一定要彻底斗垮他斗服他才对。大家一致说：斗争要斗透翻身要翻透。诉苦展开了，贫农李云长气愤的说：“过去地主奸霸们向我要租要款，逼得我向外逃荒，卖了闺女，饿死了亲兄弟与儿媳，现在非向他们要人命要闺女要儿媳不行！”大家都说：“谁都有苦，那件苦不是地主造成的？”当即开始斗争地主董思论与齐治田、齐汝文三人，从他们家中搜出了特务证，原来过去蒋军多次进攻，大家都逃走，这伙地主不逃，是做内奸哩！仇恨更大了，要董思论、齐治田、齐汝文偿还全村被毒害农民的血债。罪大恶极的奸霸，受到农民的报复，全村所有地主恶霸富农都向农民低头，一个个向农民悔过，偿还农民血汗债。
