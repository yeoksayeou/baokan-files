    General Liu Bocheng Recommends "Soldier and Commander"

    "Soldier and Commander" is a book introducing the life and career of Suvorov and his military thought. Commander Liu believes this is a good book that commanders must read. He says to the commanders of various units, "'Soldier and Commander' is really a good book. In many places, his views are consistent with our Chairman Mao's military thought. You should study this book carefully!" And he immediately finds a copy for them to read. Commander Liu feels that our commanders urgently need to understand the ideas in "Soldier and Commander," so Commander Liu often urges the Propaganda Department to publish the book as soon as possible to meet the learning needs of the commanders.

    Suvorov advocated annihilation warfare, active offensive tactics, and that soldiers should have a high sense of honor in striving to establish military merits for the people. Commanders should be good at using thought and learning from experience. The commander's exemplary behavior and strict military discipline (the higher the official position of those who violate discipline, the more severe Suvorov's punishment for him) have great enlightening effects for us.

    Commander Liu feels that many of Suvorov's famous works are still applicable today. It seems that Suvorov said, "Feet are the basic condition for determining victory, but only tools for striving for victory," are very insightful and need to be carefully deliberated and studied by us.

    Commander Liu hopes that a learning atmosphere will be created among commanders at all levels to improve their command art and strive for greater victories! (Bei Geng)

    刘伯承将军推荐“兵士兼统帅”
    “兵士兼统帅，是介绍苏渥洛夫生平事业及其军事思想的书。刘司令员认为这是指挥员必须读的一本好书，他一遇到各部队的指挥员就这样说：“‘兵士兼统帅’真是一本好书，在好多地方，他的观点与我们毛主席的军事思想是一致的，你们要好好研究这本书！”并立即亲自找一本给他们读，刘司令员觉得我们的指挥员急需领会“兵士兼统帅”的思想，所以刘司令员经常督促宣传部要使该书早日出版，以供各指挥员的学习需要。
    苏渥洛夫主张打歼灭战，主动的进攻战术，军人要有高度的争取为人民建立战功的荣誉心。指挥员要善于用思想和善于学习经验，指挥员的以身作则及严格的军事纪律（违犯纪律者官职愈高，苏渥洛夫对他的惩罚也就愈严）等等，对于我们是有很大的启示作用的。
    刘司令员觉得苏渥洛夫的不少名著至今仍然适用的，好象苏渥洛夫说：“脚是决定胜利的基本条件，而不过是争取胜利的工具”等话，都是很透辟的，需要我们加以推敲，细心研究。
    刘司令员希望：各级指挥员中造成学习的风气，把自己的指挥艺术提高一步，以争取更大的胜利！（备耕）
