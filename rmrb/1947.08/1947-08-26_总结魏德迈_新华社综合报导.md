　　Summary of Wedemeyer
　　Xinhua News Agency Comprehensive Report
　　Wedemeyer and his delegation left China today. During his month in China, he "inspected" major cities and ports in the KMT-controlled areas of North China, Northeast China, Taiwan, and South China; participated in the KMT government's "State Council Meeting" in Nanjing, and held a series of military symposiums in Shenyang, Beiping, and Taiwan. Wedemeyer's conspiracy activities are more vicious and blatant than those of Doihara before the "July 7th Incident." American imperialism has now completely replaced pre-war Japan in ruling KMT-controlled China, and Chiang Kai-shek has fully exposed his betrayal of the country for personal gain, far exceeding Wang Jingwei. Wedemeyer has brought unprecedented national humiliation to the Chinese people, marking an unparalleled national crisis for China.

　　During Wedemeyer's stay in China, various sources have revealed and continue to confirm that his mission was to "advise on adapting to the United States' global plan (i.e., expansion and aggression plan) and, based on this, provide the current Chinese government (Chiang government) with conditional supervision and assistance" (United Press, August 19th), in order to further aid Chiang in the civil war and thereby obtain Chiang Kai-shek's further unbridled betrayal of the country, comprehensively "supervising" the Chiang government to destroy all of China.

　　In this month, Wedemeyer has obtained from Chiang Kai-shek more traitorous privileges than the Japanese imperialists' "Twenty-One Demands" and the Japanese-Wang "Basic Treaty." Militarily, the United States has obtained eight military bases from Chiang Kai-shek: Taipei, Keelung, Qingdao, Dihua, Lanzhou, Tianshui, Xi'an, and Chengdu. In addition, Chiang Kai-shek has also promised to use Zuoying near Kaohsiung as a US naval and air base, and Guangzhou may also become one of the US military bases. Among the above bases, the Taiwan base is already under construction, and it is rumored that US super fortresses have already taken off and landed there. Moreover, according to reliable sources, the United States has fully transferred past Japanese Taiwan experts, Taiwan governors, military strategists, and naval admirals to Taiwan to serve as "senior advisors" for building bases and training Chiang's army. If you look at the map, we have already discovered that the United States has obtained three complete sets of base networks. The first is a base network running through the Jiaoji and Longhai railway lines and extending northwest, starting from Qingdao and reaching Xi'an, Tianshui, Lanzhou, and Dihua. The second is a maritime base network, also starting from Qingdao, to Taipei, Keelung, Guangzhou, Huangpu (where the United States is investing heavily), and reaching Yulin Port on Hainan Island, which American imperialism covets. The third is an undisclosed railway running through the southwest, euphemistically called the Marshall Railway, from Guangzhou and Guilin to Dihua, with Chengdu as its heart. In this way, the whole of China has become a military stronghold of the United States in reality. Wedemeyer's visit was to complete the task of finishing touches to this plan.

　　In addition to this control of military bases, the US military advisory group will be greatly expanded to participate in all aspects of the Chiang Defense Ministry's work, directly and comprehensively controlling Chiang Kai-shek's army. Politically, the United States will dispatch "advisors" and "experts" to "supervise" various departments of the Chiang Kai-shek government. The recently established "Foreign Exchange Stabilization Fund Committee" has two to three "advisor" positions, waiting for the American emissaries to take office. Economically, Wedemeyer has obtained the guarantee that the United States will further monopolize the KMT-controlled Chinese economy, including the construction and management rights of the Sichuan-Yunnan-Vietnam Railway running through the southwest hinterland of China, investing in the development of Guangdong and Guangxi, and expelling the traditional forces of France, especially Britain. The US plan to invest $250 million in Guangdong and Guangxi has been approved by the Chiang government; Zhang Qun has officially stated that he welcomes the US to invest heavily in all industrial sectors of China, and the Chiang government's Executive Yuan has also relaxed the control of foreign exchange and trade in response to US demands, and announced that it is "preparing to implement" the "International Monetary Fund Agreement," which stipulates the lifting of the final protection of China's national industry. In addition to the above comprehensive direct "supervision" and control of military, political, and economic affairs, Wedemeyer has also completed the task of "making China (referring to Chiang Kai-shek) consistent with the United States in its policy towards Japan," brazenly opening up trade with Japan and deciding to participate in the preparatory meeting for the peace treaty with Japan convened unilaterally by the US master. Wedemeyer's work in the past month has been to put a rope tightly around the necks of the Chinese people from all aspects of military, political, and economic affairs through Chiang Kai-shek, plunging China into an irrecoverable colonial destiny. Isn't this clear enough?

　　Wedemeyer was able to successfully complete the task of controlling KMT-controlled China, as the KMT News Agency broadcasted in the editorial of the party newspaper on the 21st, Chiang Kai-shek's rule is "just like a person after a long illness, who needs warm friendship." As long as the foreign father's hairy hand scratches his back a few times, the prodigal son with sores all over his body will kneel down in comfort and offer all the ancestral contracts with both hands. And American imperialists want to use the aid to Chiang Kai-shek in the civil war and dictatorship to achieve their goal of destroying China. As the price of Chiang Kai-shek's loyalty to the United States, the United States promised to equip Chiang with another 20 divisions and has already begun to implement it. The Youth Army 205th Division has been transported to Taiwan to begin equipping. The United States also plans to provide Chiang with economic assistance of $1.5 billion to $2 billion, so that the four major families can share a little bit of profit after betraying the country. Politically, after the "Marshall Mediation" farce completely failed, Wedemeyer also attempted to direct a counter-communist "coalition government" conspiracy, instructing Chiang Kai-shek to "expand" his government again, and Wedemeyer personally went out to seduce middle-of-the-road figures, using this as a fig leaf to aid Chiang in destroying China. But Wedemeyer's activity did not yield any results.

　　No matter how skillful the US-Chiang traitorous double act is performed, and no matter how many deceptive propaganda emerge, the essence of US aid to Chiang in the civil war has been clearly stated by the reactionary "American China Policy Association" in its letter to Wedemeyer advocating further aid to Chiang: "The National Government is fighting for us (referring to the United States) today." Here, the essence of the Chinese civil war is clear: that is, Chiang Kai-shek is fighting for American imperialism to enslave China, and the CCP and the People's Liberation Army are fighting to defend the survival of the motherland. Therefore, in contrast to Chiang Kai-shek's traitorous clique, the Chinese people have condemned Wedemeyer's activities to destroy China with righteous indignation. The All-China Student Federation, more than 100 professors in Beiping, teachers and students of Nanjing Central University, and the Democratic League have all expressed their firm opposition to the United States' direct control of China's internal affairs and its assistance in the crime of slaughtering the Chinese people. The famous writer Guo Moruo refuted the absurd rumors that he had met with Wedemeyer, emphatically stating: "I am Chinese." The contempt, hatred, and protests of all truly patriotic Chinese people have overwhelmed the arrogance of the aggressor Wedemeyer. Like a rat crossing the street, everyone shouted to beat him. Wedemeyer was forced to repeatedly make the statement that he "certainly has no territorial ambitions towards China," which is a classic case of "this place doesn't sell silver, thirty taels," which just exposed that his coming to China was only to represent the United States in plundering China's land, and there was no other good intention.

　　Wedemeyer "investigated" in China for a month, and only one thing was beyond his expectations. That is, even if American imperialism can deepen the suffering of the Chinese people, it will not be able to save Chiang Kai-shek under the strong pressure of the Chinese people to end Chiang's tyranny and strive for national independence. According to a United Press report from Nanjing on the 9th, "After touring North China and Northeast China, Wedemeyer found that the situation in China (referring to Chiang Kai-shek's rule) was worse than he had expected." Wedemeyer will find that the future of the United States re-equipping the Kuomintang army is bleak, because "diplomatic circles and neutral observers" have reminded him: "The Communists not only have weapons from the former Japanese army, but also seized many American-equipped weapons from the American-equipped Kuomintang army" (same as above). Wedemeyer will see that American imperialism's loans to save Chiang Kai-shek's financial and economic crisis are also in vain. "All American businessmen who have spoken to United Press reporters have repeatedly said: Any large-scale dumping of funds, even if it can temporarily improve (Chiang Kai-shek's) economic situation, the economic situation will continue to worsen" (United Press, Shanghai, 20th). Even the American diplomatic authorities in Washington believe that "tens of thousands of dollars would be enough to 'revive' (?), but it would cost the United States countless tens of thousands of dollars to let the Chinese (referring to Chiang Kai-shek's gang) do something themselves" (Associated Press, Washington, 15th of last month). This shows that in the face of the power of the Chinese people, the ferocious American imperialists have to show hesitation and lack of confidence; therefore, even on the Kuomintang side, they feel that there is no cure for Chiang Kai-shek's rule, and they find that the United States' "meager" assistance still cannot fill their bottomless pit. In the party newspaper editorial on the 21st, the Kuomintang News Agency was already quietly complaining that this was because the American master was letting them down, believing that this scale of assistance was not the same as the United States getting involved, so they hoped that one day they could drag the United States all down, saying "We have an unwavering belief that the United States on the other side of the Pacific will eventually stand with us;" the editorial had already begun to weakly say something like "self-reliance" and "everything is in my hands" and other extremely discouraged words. There is no doubt that American imperialists will definitely not be able to save Chiang Kai-shek's traitorous and corrupt rule, nor will they be able to achieve the goal of enslaving China. The humiliation that Wedemeyer wrote down in modern Chinese history will eventually be cleared by the power of the Chinese people's revolutionary movement.

　　总结魏德迈
  　新华社综合报导
    魏德迈及其使团今天离开中国了。他在中国一个月，“视察”了华北、东北、台湾、华南等蒋管区各主要城市和主要海港；在南京参加了蒋政府的“国务会议”，在沈阳、北平和台湾又召开了一连串军事座谈。魏德迈的阴谋活动，比起“七七”事变前的土肥原更恶毒，也更露骨。美国帝国主义今天已完全代替了战前的日本君临蒋管中国，而蒋介石也完全暴露了他的卖国求荣已远远超过了汪精卫。魏德迈给中国人民带来了从来未见的国耻，标志着中国空前未有的民族危机。
    在魏德迈留华期间，各方消息已经透露并继续证实，其来华任务是来“建议适应美国的全球计划（按即扩张和侵略计划），并以此为基础予目前中国政府（蒋政府）以有条件的监督与援助”（合众社十九日电），以便进一步援蒋内战，并借此获得蒋介石进一步放手卖国，全面“监督”蒋政府来灭亡全中国。
    在这一个月中，魏德迈已由蒋介石那边，得到了比日本帝国主义者的“二十一条”和日汪“基本条约”有过无不及的亡华特权。在军事上，美国已自蒋介石手中取得了台北、基隆、青岛、迪化、兰州、天水、西安、成都八个军事基地，另外蒋介石还答应将高雄附近的左营作为美国海空军基地，广州亦可能作为美国军事基地之一。上述基地中，台湾基地已在动手建筑，盛传美超空堡垒已在该地起落。不但如此，据可靠消息，美国已将过去日本的台湾通、台湾总督、军事家、海军大将，都尽情搬到台湾来做兴筑基地训练蒋军的“高级参议”。如果打开地图一看，我们已发现美国已获得了三副有整套系统的基地网。第一个是贯通胶济、陇海两干线而延伸西北的基地网，由青岛算起，直达西安、天水、兰州、迪化；第二个是海上基地网，也由青岛算起，到台北、基隆、广州、黄埔（美国正在此大事投资），直达海南岛上美帝国主义垂涎三尺的榆林港；第三个是贯通西南的不公开的、美其名曰马歇尔铁路的，由广州、桂林直达迪化，而以成都为其心脏。这样，全中国便实际上成了美国的军略据点。魏德迈此来，就是给这计划完成画龙点睛的任务。
    除这种军事基地的控制外，美军事顾问团将大事扩充，参加蒋记国防部的各方面工作，直接与全面控制蒋介石的军队。在政治上，美即将派遣“顾问”及“专家”以“监督”蒋介石政府各部门。最近成立的“外汇平衡基金委员会”即设有两名至三名“顾问”的职位，正在等待美国钦差到任。在经济上，魏德迈已取得了美国对蒋管中国从事进一步经济垄断的保证，包括对纵贯中国西南腹地的川滇越铁路的建筑和管理权，投资开发两广及湖南，而逐出法国，特别是英国的传统势力。美方两亿五千万美元投资两广的计划，已获得蒋政府首肯；张群已正式声明欢迎美方对中国一切工业部门大量投资，蒋政府行政院亦已适应美方要求，放宽对外汇及贸易的管制，并宣布“准备实行”规定解除中国民族工业最后保障的“国际货币基金协定”。除了上述军事、政治、经济的全面的直接的“监督”和控制之外，魏德迈还完成了“使中国（指蒋介石）在对日政策上和美国一致”的任务，悍然开放对日贸易，并决定参加美国主子单独召集的对日和约预备会议。魏德迈一个月来的工作，就是从军事、政治、经济各方面，通过蒋介石，在中国人民头颈上死死地套上一根绳索，沦中国于万劫不复的殖民地命运，难道还不清楚吗？
    魏德迈所以能顺利完成控制蒋管区中国的任务，正如国民党通讯社廿一日所播发的党报社论所说的，蒋介石统治“恰如久病之后的人，需要温暖的友情，”只要洋爸爸的毛手在背上搔两三下，于是浑身溃疮的败家子就通泰酥软地一把跪下，将一切祖宗契约都双手供献出来了。而美帝国主义者也正是要借援助蒋介石内战独裁，来达到它亡华的目的。作为蒋介石效忠美国的代价是，美国答应再给蒋装备廿个师，并已开始实行，青年军二○五师已运往台湾开始装备。美国并拟予蒋以十五亿至二十亿美元的经济援助，使四大家族在卖国之后分一点余沥。在政治上，魏德迈在“马歇尔调处”的把戏完全破产以后，还企图导演一幕反共的“联合政府”阴谋剧，示意蒋介石再“扩大”他的政府，魏并亲自出马勾引中间派人士，借此作为援蒋亡华的遮羞布。但魏德迈这一活动并无结果。
    不论美蒋亡华双簧演得如何技巧，欺骗宣传如何层出不穷，但是美国援蒋内战的本质，已由反动的“美国对华政策协会”在其致魏德迈主张进一步援蒋的信中说得很明白：“国民政府今日正为吾人（指美国）而战。”在这里中国内战的本质：即蒋介石是为美帝国主义奴役中国而战，中共与人民解放军则为保卫祖国生存而战，是再明白不过了。因此与蒋介石卖国贼集团相反，中国人民对魏德迈灭华的活动，无不加以义正辞严的叱责。全国学联、北平百余教授、南京中大的师生们，以至民主同盟，均表示坚决反对美国直接控制中国内政，以及援屠杀中国人民的罪行，名作家郭沫若在驳斥说他曾去见魏德迈的无稽谣言时力称：“我是中国人。”一切真正爱国的中国人的蔑视憎恨和抗议，曾压倒了侵略者魏德迈的气焰，老鼠过街，人人喊打，迫得魏德迈还不得不再三作出“对中国确无领土野心”的“此地无银三十两”的声明，也就恰恰暴露了他之来中国，除了是代表美帝掠夺中国的土地以外，再也没有别的好心肠了。
    魏德迈在中国“调查”了一个月，只有一件事是出乎他的意料的，这就是美帝国主义纵能加深中国人民的苦难，但在中国人民为结束蒋家暴政，争取民族独立的强大压力下，将挽救不了蒋介石。据合众社南京九日电称：“在巡游华北、东北之后，魏德迈发现中国（指蒋介石统治）的形势，比他所预料者更坏”。魏德迈将发现美国重新装备国民党军队的前途是暗淡的，因为“外交界及中立观察家们”曾提示他：“共产党不仅有以前日军的武器，而且从美械国民党军队手中缴获许多美械装备”（同前电）。魏德迈将会看到美帝国主义贷款挽救蒋介石财政经济危机也是徒劳的，“一切与合众社记者谈过话的美国商人都再三地说：任何整批的资金倾销，纵使能暂时改进（蒋介石的）经济情况，然经济情况仍会继续更加恶化”（合众社上海二十日沪电）。就是华盛顿的美国外交当局也认为“几万万美元就很够希‘复兴’（？）之用了，但是要让中国人（指蒋介石之流）自己能做出些事情来，却得化费美国无数个几十万万元”（美联社上月十五日华盛顿电）。这表现了在中国人民的力量面前，凶恶的美帝国主义者也不得不现出瞻前后，信心不高；因此就在国民党方面，也预感到对于蒋介石统治无可救药的规律，他们发现美国的“区区”援助，到底还填不满他们的无底洞。国民党通讯社在二十一日的党报社论中，已在悄悄地埋怨这是美国主子对他们不起，认为这种规模的援助还不等于美国已经下水，因此就希望终有一日能够把美国全部拖下水去，说“我们对于太平洋彼岸的美国，到了最后必能和我们站在一起，却持有不变的信念；”该社论已开始有气无力地说到什么“自力更生”、“尽在我”之类极丧气的话了。毫无疑义，美帝国主义者决然挽救不了蒋介石卖国腐败统治，亦决然达不到奴役中国的目的。魏德迈在中国现代史上所写下的屈辱，最后必为中国人民革命运动的力量所廓清。（新华社陕北二十四日电）
