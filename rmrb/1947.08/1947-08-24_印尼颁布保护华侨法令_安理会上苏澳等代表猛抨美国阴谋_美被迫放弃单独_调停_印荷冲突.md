Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 22nd: Batavia News: The Supreme Defense Council of the Republic of Indonesia and the Commander-in-Chief of the Indonesian Army have jointly issued a new decree to protect the lives and property of Overseas Chinese within Indonesian territory. The contents of the decree include: (1) All Overseas Chinese who have been ordered to move into protected camps must be released and returned to their original residences, except for those whose original residences are in areas occupied by Dutch troops. (2) The safety of Overseas Chinese must be guaranteed. If their homes have been destroyed, arrangements must be made to resettle them, and all expenses shall be borne by the Indonesian government. (3) If the original residences of Overseas Chinese are located in Dutch-occupied areas, their living expenses shall be paid by the Indonesian government. If they have family members residing in Indonesia, the Indonesian government will also find ways to reunite them. (4) Anyone who looted the property of Overseas Chinese during the Dutch military's forced occupation will be subject to relief from the looted Overseas Chinese on one hand, and legal steps will be taken to deal with criminals whose crimes have been confirmed on the other hand.

Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 22nd: Chenggong Lake News: After a week of intense debate on the Indonesian issue at the Security Council since the 11th, the meeting adjourned on the 19th. The focus of this meeting was to discuss further steps to resolve the Indonesian-Dutch dispute. Soviet representative Gromyko fiercely criticized the US conspiracy of independent "mediation" at the meeting and demanded the immediate organization of a Security Council arbitration committee to go to Indonesia to resolve the Indonesian-Dutch conflict. Indonesian representative Sjahrir also insisted on the position of the Republic, believing that only arbitration by the Security Council is the only way to deal with the Indonesian issue. The Australian representative exposed the fact that the US's independent "mediation" has yielded no results in the past two years, and reiterated the proposal that the Security Council should quickly and peacefully arbitrate the Indonesian-Dutch dispute. The United States was very isolated in the debate, forcing the US State Department to formally withdraw the original proposal for independent "mediation" on the 19th; however, US representative Johnson stubbornly opposed the Soviet proposal at the meeting and tried his best to support the proposal of Chiang Kai-shek's representative (Jiang Tingfu). This proposal requires the Indonesian representative to submit a report on the current situation in Indonesia and the implementation of the ceasefire order. At the same time, it proposes that India and the Netherlands each designate a national representative, and that India and the Netherlands select a representative from a third country to form a committee. This suggestion from the Chiang Kai-shek representative is exactly the same as that proposed by the Dutch representative on the 15th, attempting to deny the Security Council's right to handle the Indonesian issue on its own and to open up another path for the United States to come forward alone for "mediation." The Security Council is preparing to continue the discussion on the 22nd.

Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 22nd: News from Various Sources: The current Indonesian war has expanded and intensified more than before the ceasefire order. Dutch troops who violated the agreement continued to invade on a large scale, attempting to capture the Indonesian capital, Yogyakarta. According to the Indonesian Republic Gazette: The Dutch troops, who launched offensives from Semarang, Cilacap, and Surabaya, have made little progress under the resolute resistance of the Indonesian army and people. Street fighting also occurred in Malang. The offensive and defensive battles in major cities in southern Sumatra and Madura Island are in full swing, and many Indonesian villages and towns have been burned down due to indiscriminate bombing by Dutch aircraft. Indonesian guerrillas are actively disrupting transportation and blocking the advance of Dutch troops in Dutch-occupied areas, thus making the position of Dutch troops in Java, Sumatra, and Madura increasingly difficult.

　　印尼颁布保护华侨法令
    安理会上苏澳等代表猛抨美国阴谋
    美被迫放弃单独“调停”印荷冲突
    【新华社陕北二十二日电】巴达维亚讯：印尼共和国最高国防委员会及印尼军总司令，顷联合发表保障印尼领土内华侨生命财产之新法令。该法令内容包括：（一）凡曾被命迁入保护营居住之华侨，须予释放，并遣返其原住处：原住处在荷军占领区者除外。（二）华侨之安全须予以保证，彼等之住宅如已被毁则必须为其设法安顿，其一切费用该由印尼政府负担。（三）华侨原住处如系位于荷军占领区，则彼等之生活费应由印尼政府支付，彼等如有家属侨居印尼内，印尼政府并将设法使其得以团聚。（四）任何人于荷军迫近期中有掠夺华侨财产者，一方对被掠夺之华侨予以救济，一方将采取合法步骤处置业已证实其罪状之歹徒。
    【新华社陕北二十二日电】成功湖讯：安理会自十一日起对印度问题第二次作一周激烈辩论后，于十九日休会。此次会议中心系讨论进一步采取步骤，以解放印荷争端问题。苏代表葛米珂在会上猛烈抨击美国单独“调停”之阴谋，要求立即组织安理会仲裁委员会赴印尼，以解决印荷冲突。印尼代表沙利尔亦坚持共和国立场，认为只有由安理会仲裁才是唯一处理印尼问题的办法。澳代表揭露两年来美国单独“调停”毫无结果之事实，并重申安理会应迅速和平仲裁印荷纠纷之提议。在辩论中美国甚形孤立，迫使美国务院不得不于十九日正式撤消单独“调停”之原议；但美国代表詹生在会上仍顽固地反对苏方建议，竭力支持蒋家代表（蒋廷黻）之提案。该提案要求印尼代表对印尼现状及执行停战令之情形提出报告，同时，提议由印、荷各指定一国代表，并由印、荷挑选一第三国之代表，合组一委员会。蒋记代表这一建议，与荷代表十五日所提出者如出一辙，企图否认安理会有自行处理印尼问题之权，并为美国单独出面“调停”另辟蹊径。安理会准备于二十二日继续讨论。
    【新华社陕北二十二日电】各方讯：目前印尼战事已较停战令前更形扩大和激烈。破坏协约之荷军继续大规模进犯，以图打下印尼首都日惹。据印尼共和国公报称：从三宝珑、芝拉扎、泗水发动攻势之荷军，在印尼军民坚决抗议下，无大进展。玛琅亦发生巷战，苏门答腊南部及马都拉岛上重要城市之攻防战，正猛烈进行中，许多印尼村镇因荷机滥炸而焚毁。印尼游击队积极在荷占领区破坏交通并阻击荷军推进，因而使荷军在爪哇、苏岛马都拉之地位日益困难。
