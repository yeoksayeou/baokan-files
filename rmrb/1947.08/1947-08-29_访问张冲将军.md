　　Xinhua News Agency, Northeast, 26th: In a white Western-style house, this reporter met General Zhang Chong, a famous general of the Yunnan Army and former commander of the Kuomintang New Third Army. He is of medium height, wearing a yellow military uniform. Due to multiple injuries in the war, his face is yellowish, and he always has a Yunnan-made tobacco pipe in his hand. He is cheerful and talkative. General Zhang explained that from his more than twenty years of practical life, especially since the War of Resistance Against Japan, he has profoundly recognized Chiang Kai-shek's conspiracy to implement national betrayal, dictatorship, civil war, and to divide and eliminate local forces and ethnic minorities. Therefore, his resolute arrival in the liberated area this time is by no means accidental. He said: "I am a non-partisan soldier. During the War of Resistance Against Japan, I only knew how to implement the anti-Japanese democratic united front and resolutely resist to the end. As a result, Chiang Kai-shek said that I was 'having other intentions.' On the surface, I was promoted from division commander to army commander, commander-in-chief, etc., but in reality, he sent a large number of secret agents to monitor and 'examine' my actions all day long. After the victory of the War of Resistance Against Japan, I strongly advocated the implementation of peace and democracy, but Chiang Kai-shek said that I was a 'Communist.' Since Chiang Kai-shek occupied Yunnan, I have been even more surrounded by secret agents, and my words and actions have been deprived of freedom." Then, General Zhang exposed Chiang Kai-shek's process of annexing Yunnan, pointing out that the people of Yunnan have made valuable contributions in the Yunnan Uprising against Yuan Shikai, the Great Revolution, and the War of Resistance Against Japan. Especially in the War of Resistance Against Japan, the people of Yunnan spared no effort to destroy their homes and overcome difficulties in order to protect their homes and defend against the enemy. But what Chiang Kai-shek gave the people of Yunnan was: poverty, darkness, and terror. After the "July 7th" Incident, Chiang Kai-shek, under the guise of "resistance against Japan," first transferred the Yunnan army to the front line of the War of Resistance Against Japan, sitting idly by as they were sacrificed without replenishment, allowing the Japanese invaders to eliminate them, while Chiang Kai-shek transferred his own direct line troops away from the front line to Yunnan to monitor and eliminate local forces. After the Japanese invaders surrendered, under the guise of "accepting the surrender," he sent a part of the Yunnan troops to Vietnam and another part to the Northeast to attack the People's Liberation Army, attempting to eliminate the Yunnan army on the civil war front. After Chiang Kai-shek completed the plan to transfer the Yunnan army, he began to crack down on local forces in Yunnan in October 1934, drove away Long Yun, reorganized the Yunnan Provincial Government, replaced it with the secret agent leader Li Zonghuang, and seized all the property of the people of Yunnan. Since then, Yunnan has fallen into the darkness of reactionary secret agent terror. General Zhang Chong said indignantly: "Staying in the KMT-controlled area, even if the secret agents did not arrest me or assassinate me, they would have angered me to death." Speaking of his use of participating in the "National Assembly" to come to the liberated area this time, he said humorously: "Chiang Kai-shek wanted to use the 'National Assembly' to support him and isolate patriotic and democratic parties. Who knew that the National Assembly shortened my road to the liberated area." Regarding his impressions after coming to the liberated area, General Zhang said that this was the happiest period of his life. He praised all the measures in the liberated area, especially the land reform. Finally, he told reporters that he was determined to fight to the end with the people of the liberated area for the liberation of Yunnan and the whole of China.

　　访问张冲将军
    【新华社东北二十六日电】在一座白色的洋房内，记者会见了滇军著名将领、前国民党新编第三军军长张冲将军。他中等身材，穿着黄色军服，由于战争中多次负伤，面现黄色，手中离不开一根云南土制的烟袋，爽朗而健谈。张将军说明：从他二十余年来的实际生活，特别从抗日战争以来深刻认识了蒋介石实行卖国独裁内战及分化消灭地方势力和少数民族的阴谋。因此他此次毅然来解放区绝不是偶然的。他说：“我是一个无党无派的军人，在抗日战争中，只知实行抗日民主统一战线，坚决抗战到底，结果蒋介石却说我是：‘另有企图’，表面上从师长提升为军长、总指挥等职，实际上却派遣大批特务，整天监视‘考察’我的行动。抗战胜利后，我力主实行和平民主，蒋介石却说我是‘共产党’。自从蒋介石霸占云南以后，我更陷入特务的包围中，言论行动都不得自由”。接着张将军揭露蒋介石吞并云南的经过。指出：云南人民讨袁护国、大革命以及抗日战争中都有着可贵的贡献，特别在抗日战争中，云南人民为了保家御敌，毁家纡难，在所不惜。但蒋介石给云南人民的却是：穷困、黑暗和恐怖。“七七”事变后，蒋介石假“抗战”之名，首将云南军队调至抗日前线，坐视牺牲，不予补充，让日寇去消灭，而蒋介石却将自己的嫡系部队，远离前线，运至云南，监视和消灭地方势力。日寇投降后，又假“受降”之名，把云南部队一部往越南，一部调往东北去进攻人民解放军，企图消灭云南军队于内战火线。蒋介石完成了调走云南军队的计划以后，就在三四年十月向云南地方势力进行开刀，撵走了龙云，改组云南省政府，以特务头子李宗黄代理，霸占了云南人民的一切财产，从此云南便陷入了黑暗反动特务恐怖中。张冲将军愤慨地说：“在蒋管区再待下去，就是特务不逮捕我暗杀我，也曾把我气死的。”谈到他这次利用参加“国民大会”到解放区来，他诙谐的说：“蒋介石想利用‘国大’替他捧场，孤立爱国和民主党派，谁知国民大会却缩短了我来到解放区的道路。”对来解放区后的观感，张将军说这是他平生最快乐的时期，他对解放区的一切措施，尤其对土地改革更备加赞扬。最后他对记者表示：今后决与解放区人民一起，为解放云南及全中国而奋斗到底。
