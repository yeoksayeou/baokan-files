    Changzhi First District
    Convenes Poor and Hired Peasant Congress
    To Promote Production and Thrift
    [This newspaper's Changzhi dispatch] The first district of this county convened a congress of more than 600 poor and hired peasants on July 27 to conduct ideological mobilization for production and preparation against famine. First, the method of "talking about thoughts" was used to break the complacency and dependency mentality. Then, the masses were guided to complain about the suffering of the famine, and at the same time, they recalled their experiences in surviving the famine, boosting their morale. Finally, the following methods for increasing production and practicing thrift were unanimously adopted: 1. In terms of increasing production: (1) More hoeing, raking, and topdressing should be done to eliminate wasteland and grow more vegetables. (2) Seize the gaps to engage in transportation and buy grain. (3) Launch the second hundred-day textile movement. 2. In terms of thrift: (1) Break all feudal obstacles, stop all waste, and do not arbitrarily mobilize the masses to donate things. (2) Each village should rectify its village finances to achieve self-sufficiency in village funds. (3) Eat bran and vegetables to lower living standards. (4) Accumulate bran, vegetables, bran, bean cakes and other substitute foods. Mass cadres in each village have formulated specific plans and launched challenge competitions to strive to become models.

    长治一区
    召开贫雇大会
    推动生产节约
    【本报长治讯】本县一区于七月二十七日召开全区贫雇六百余人大会，进行生产备荒思想发动。首先用谈心思办法，打破自满与依赖心理，接着诱导群众向灾荒诉苦，同时回忆渡荒经验，鼓起斗志。最后一致订出如下几种增产节约办法：一、在增产方面：（１）要多锄多搂多上追肥，消灭荒地多种菜。（２）抓紧空隙，搞运输买粮食。（３）展开第二个百日纺织运动。二、在节约上：（１）要打破一切封建圪节，制止一切浪费，不准向群众随意动员募东西。（２）各村整顿村财政，作到村款自给，（３）掺糠吃菜降低生活。（４）积蓄糠、菜、麸、豆饼等代食品。各村群众干部都订出了具体计划，并展开了挑战比赛，争取当模范。
