　　Military Training Becomes a Craze: Learning from Jiao Wubao
    [This Dispatch from Our Newspaper, Taiyue, 27th] The battalion where Jiao Wubao is stationed is now launching a craze for military training and studying current affairs. During the military training, the branch of each company put forward the slogans "Improve skills, prepare for a major counter-offensive" and "Study current affairs and put down burdens." In conjunction with this slogan, the unit launched a movement to "record well, spread well, and learn well." Everyone wanted to improve their skills and compete for meritorious service, especially advocating using their brains to find solutions. At the beginning of the military training, it was found that some veteran soldiers were not as enthusiastic about learning as the new soldiers. At this time, the battalion held a "Zhuge Liang Meeting" to study and improve teaching methods, correct the old ways of doing things, widely absorb the soldiers' practical experience and skills, and promote Jiao Wubao's method of mutual assistance and mutual learning. After this improvement, experience and technology were combined, everyone taught and everyone learned, fully utilizing the role of the mass line. Therefore, the enthusiasm for military training was great, and progress was rapid. For example, Zhang Maimai, a member of Jiao Wubao's group, always took new soldiers to practice every day. Wang Zhensheng, a liberated soldier, had only been in the army for two weeks, but he was able to actively help others learn skills, and said, "As long as you are willing to learn, I will be happy to teach!" Comrade Zhang De of the Seventh Company was not diligent enough in his work before, but this time, after recording his progress well, he became even more active, and said to his platoon leader, "I am determined to catch up with Jiao Wubao." Among the cadres, there was also a realization that "As long as we can record well, spread well, everyone can learn well and do well!" "As long as we can work with our brains, we can achieve results." In the military training, setting up springboards, which initially took five minutes, now only takes fifteen seconds to set up a springboard over a three-zhang wide trench. In the first week, new soldier Tian Xi could only throw a grenade more than twenty meters, but in the second week, he threw it forty meters.

　　练兵成热潮　学习焦五保
    【本报太岳二十七日电】焦五保所在营现正展开练兵和学习时事的热潮。在练兵中，各连支部都提出“提高技术，准备大反攻”与“学习时事放下包袱”的口号，结合着这一口号，该部即开展记好、传好、学好运动，大家为了练好本领，比赛立功，特别提倡了用脑子想办法，在练兵的开始，发现有些老战士不如新战士的学习情绪高，这时营里便召开“诸葛亮会议”，研究改进教育方法，纠正过去老一套的毛病，广泛的吸收战士的实战经验与技术，发扬焦五保的互助互学办法。经过这番改进，使经验与技术结合，大家教，大家学，完全发挥了群众路线的作用，所以练兵的劲头很大，进步也很快。如焦五保的组员张麦麦，每天总是带着新战士去练。解放战士王畛生到部队才两个礼拜，就能积极的帮助别人学习技术，并说：“只要你们愿意学，我就高兴教！”七连张德同志，以前工作不够努力，这次记好后，也更加积极起来，对他排长说：“我决心要赶上焦五保。”在干部中，也认识了“只要能够作到记好，传好，人人就能学好，作好！”“只要能够用脑子工作，就能有成绩。”练兵中搭跳板，开始架起须用五分钟，现在于三丈宽的壕沟上架起跳板，仅须十五秒钟。新战士田喜，第一周投弹只能投二十多米，第二周就投了四十米。
