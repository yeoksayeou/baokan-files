Squeeze Out Feudalism, Heighten Vigilance
Litai Coal Mine Suppresses Counter-Revolutionaries and Eliminates Special Agents

[This newspaper reported] On the 18th, all employees of the Litai Coal Mine in He Village, Wu'an, and local people held a joint anti-traitor meeting. In the feudalism-squeezing movement last month, after the misguided element Li Renyuan confessed, all employees immediately turned to the movement of anti-special agents and digging up bad roots. After half a month of group discussions, team accusations, and a public trial by the representatives' meeting of the destructive facts of the special agents, everything was fully revealed. The special agents' methods of destruction were, first, to fabricate and stir up trouble; using the saying, "The district government doesn't care about Litai, and Litai doesn't care about the district government," to provoke the relationship between the local area and the coal mine; propagating the distorted theory that "the trade union wants workers to do less work and earn more money" and "the company wants workers to do more work and earn less money," to undermine the relationship between the trade union and the administration; spreading rumors such as "now it's the workers' world, and cadres can't get anywhere," to make the workers disunited. The second step was to develop a special agent organization in places where our work was weak: three were developed in the workers' cooperative, five among the workers in the South Main Tunnel, and two among the staff. The targets for development were: first, landlords; second, some rich and middle peasants who were dissatisfied with land reform; and third, cadres who had made mistakes in the past and were dissatisfied with the leadership. The method was to take advantage of war fluctuations and propagate counter-revolutionary ideas. After the enemy occupied Guantai last year, two special agents were developed in the cooperative. They lured landlords, with Gao Feng saying to Kong Qingchun when developing him: "Now our households being struggled against are in more and more danger every day. If we want to find a way out, we can only rely on the Kuomintang." They threatened middle peasants. When Gao Guangsheng developed Li Renyuan (a middle peasant), he said: "You are the big manager of the cooperative. When the 'South Wind' (referring to the reactionaries) comes, it will be terrible." Li was threatened by him. They also used the shameless honey trap, with special agent Wang Zemin using his wife and sister-in-law to seduce and corrupt cadres. After the first two steps of destructive work achieved some gains, the third step was to attack progressive forces and murder workers and cadres, using both overt and covert means. In June, the special agents used some of Li Qinghai's (production team leader of the coal miners) embezzlement facts, and fabricated some embezzlement for Zhang Jinsheng (branch cadre of the trade union), surrounded some leading cadres, incited backward workers, and struggled against Li, preparing to use the butcher's knife and take the opportunity to murder these two workers at the meeting, accusing the trade union of covering up and encouraging workers to oppose the trade union. This was the overt plan. Covertly, they bought five pistols, attempting to shoot people with black guns. Special agent Yang Qingshan instructed Li Xingtang to break the water pump lever at the No. 6 well, claiming that it was done by the workers in the North Tunnel, attempting to break down the workers in the North Tunnel. When the special agents told these destructive facts one by one at the meeting, the masses were extremely resentful. Even some backward workers in the past were shocked and hated the special agents. When the presidium announced group discussions, each group discussed: killing three Eighth Route Army soldiers (done by special agent Xiao Ruting, who helped the Kuomintang army in the twenty-eighth year), wounding a militiaman's arm with a bomb, and blowing up a horse gun (done by special agent Gao Feng in the thirty-second year). Now they want to murder our workers and cadres, and destroy the revolutionary factory. Old hatreds plus new hatreds, we must take revenge. Immediately, they proposed to the presidium of the meeting that the special agent masterminds Gao Feng, Wang Zemin, and Xiao Ruting and one other major criminal should be executed immediately. District Chief Chen immediately represented the government and gave a satisfactory answer to the people's request. Now the mine has also proposed: "Thoroughly break with landlords and special agents ideologically," and all employees have launched a thought investigation movement. (Zhang Li)

　　挤出封建提高警惕
  　利太煤矿反奸肃特
    【本报讯】十八日，武安和村利太煤矿全体职工和当地群众，举行联合反奸大会。在上月挤封建运动中，上当分子李仁元坦白后，全体职工马转入反特务刨坏根运动，经过半个月的小组讨论，分队控诉，代表会公审特务破坏事实，完全揭发了出来。特务破坏办法首先是造，挑拨是非；用“署不尿利太，利太不尿区署”的言，挑拨地方与煤矿的关系；宣传“工会是要工人少做活多赚钱”“公司是要工人多做活少赚钱，”的歪曲理论，破坏工会与行政的关系；散布些“如今是工人天下，干部吃不开”的言，使职工不团结。第二步是在我工薄弱的地方，发展特务组织：在职工合作社发展了三个，在南大巷工人中发展五个，在职员中发展两个。发展对象：首先是地主，其次是对土地改革不满的一些富、中农；再就是过去犯了错误对领导上不满的干部，方式是利用战争波动，宣传天思想。去年敌占观台后，在合作社就发展了两个特务。对地主利诱，高峰发展孔庆春时说：“现在咱们被斗户，一天比一天危险，要想找出路，只有依靠国民党”。对中农是威胁手段，高广生发展李仁元（中农）时说：“你是合作社大经理，南风（指反动派）过来可了不得”。李仁就被他威胁住了。并且还用无的美人计，特务王泽民使他老婆和小姨勾搭腐化干部。上两步破坏工作达到某些收获以后，紧接第三步就是打击进步力量，谋杀工人与干部，使的是明暗两种手段。六月间特务们利用李清海（采炭工生产队长）一些贪污事实，又给张金生（工会一支部干部）捏造了一些贪污，包围了一部分领导干部，煽动落后工人，向李进行斗争，准备下杀猪刀，要在大会上乘机谋杀这两个工人，并工会包庇，鼓励工人反对工会，这是明的一套；暗里又买了五支手枪，企图用黑枪打人；特务杨青山指示李兴堂把六口下的水泵拉杆坏，宣传说是北大巷工人弄的，企图打垮北巷工人。当特务们在大会上把这些破坏事实，一宗一件的说出以后，群众听了，痛恨万分，连过去某些落后工人，也大吃一惊，对特务仇视起来。当主席团宣布分讨论时，每个组都讨论着：杀了三个八路军（二十八年特务萧汝廷帮助国民党军队干的），炸伤一个民兵的胳膊，炸坏一支马枪（三十二年特务高峰干的），现在又要谋害我们的工人和干部，破坏革命工厂，旧仇加新恨，非报仇不行，当下就向大会主席团提出特务主谋分子高峰、王泽　⒘豕阈恕⑾?汝廷等四个凶犯立时处死，陈区长当下就代表政府，满的答复了群众要求，现在该矿又提出：“从思想上和地主特务彻底分家”，全体职工展开了查思想运动。（张力）
