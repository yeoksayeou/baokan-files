　　Shanghai Labor Strikes Continue
  　Protesting Employer Wage Cuts
    Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 20th. Tianjin Newspaper reports: Labor strikes in Shanghai continue to occur after Chiang Kai-shek issued the reactionary "General Mobilization Order." Workers at printing companies throughout the city, protesting the "Labor-Management Arbitration Committee's" wage cuts, began striking on the 22nd of last month, with over 3,000 workers participating. Employees of the city's private shipping industry also went on strike starting July 3rd, demanding wage increases that were rejected by employers. They have achieved initial victory and resumed work on the 20th. Over 800 laid-off workers from Chiang's Navy Jiangnan Shipyard, before the flag-raising ceremony for Japanese warships received by Chiang's government on the 6th of last month, lined up to appeal to all sectors of society, requesting job security and reinstatement, among five demands. On that day, workers ignored the Lao Zha Branch Bureau police's obstruction and went to the city center to publicize their cause. Several were arrested, but the workers were unyielding. That evening, they held a reception for reporters at the Jiangnan Shipyard, protesting the Chiang government's unreasonable persecution.

　　上海工潮绵延
  　抗议资方削减工资
    【新华社陕北二十日电】津报讯：上海工潮在蒋介石颁布反动“总动员令”之后，仍继续发生。全市印刷公司工人因反对“劳资评断会”裁减工资，于上月廿二日起罢工，参加罢工工人达三千余人。全市民船业职工亦因要求增加工资为资方拒绝，自七月三日起罢工，已获得初步胜利，于二十日复工。上月六日蒋记海军江南造船所被裁职工八百余人，于上月六日蒋政府接收日舰升旗典礼前，列队向各界呼吁请愿，提出要求保障职业，及要求复工等五项要求，当日工人不顾老闸分局警察阻拦前往市区宣传，数名曾遭逮捕，但工人们不屈不挠，是日晚间在江南造船所招待记者，抗议蒋政府无理迫害。
