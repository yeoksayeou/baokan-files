The Military Region Political Department Issues Directive
　　Land Reform Education to be Conducted Throughout the Army
    [Our Newspaper Special Dispatch] In order to ensure that the People's Liberation Army wholeheartedly serves the people, the Political Department of the Jin-Ji-Lu-Yu Military Region recently issued a directive, deciding to universally conduct ideological education on land reform throughout the army in August, and to launch a movement of class and ideological investigation. The directive first explained that the most basic task of the People's Army currently is to eliminate feudal forces, liberate the broad masses of the people, and realize "land to the tiller." It is precisely because of this that we have gained the support of the broad masses of the people, their participation in the war and the army, forming an inexhaustible and invincible force. Therefore, all personnel must do their best to support and participate in land reform, thoroughly eliminate the ideological remnants of feudal landlords, and firmly stand on the side of the peasants. The implementation steps begin with an investigation of the speeches and actions related to land reform that have been reflected in the troops, and then launch a movement of ideological and class investigation (cadres focus on investigating ideology, soldiers focus on investigating class). Based on the actual situation of the troops, prescribe the right medicine and conduct systematic ideological education. An outline of ideological education on land reform is issued as a reference for various troops to solve several basic ideological problems during education. The general spirit and principles should be based on Deputy Political Commissar Bo's summary report on land reform. Finally, it is required to achieve a clear stance, clear thinking, close connection with the masses, and resolute implementation of land reform by all army personnel. Therefore, those who evade struggle and attempt to retaliate against the targets of struggle must be resolutely cleared out of the army and handed back to the local authorities for handling. Generally, those with landlord status who joined the army, if they perform well in the army and have meritorious service in killing the enemy, should be strengthened in education to promote their change of class stance to serve the people.
