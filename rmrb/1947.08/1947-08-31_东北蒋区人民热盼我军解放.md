Xinhua News Agency, Northeast, August 29th: The people in the KMT-controlled areas of Northeast China are living in dire straits and eagerly awaiting the arrival of the People's Liberation Army. In Jinzhou, the poor, intellectual youths, and general low-level civil servants, unable to endure the KMT's oppression through conscription and exorbitant taxes, are fervently hoping for the Democratic Allied Army to come and rescue them. Many of them have already fled to their relatives' homes in the liberated areas. Commercial taxes have increased tenfold in the area, and even those selling cigarettes with small baskets have to pay taxes of tens of thousands of yuan. When the Democratic Allied Army launches attacks, the local compatriots who have suffered greatly all earnestly request land reform, saying, "Comrades, now that you are here, we have a backbone. As long as you don't leave, we will dare to settle accounts with the bad eggs!" Furthermore, according to a dispatch from Chengde: Since the beginning of July, the KMT troops in Chengde, Luanping, and other places have been dispatching thirty to forty trucks every day, transporting large quantities of wealth extorted from the people and their families inland, and selling off clothes in large quantities, causing market chaos. Now, the KMT troops in the area are like frightened birds. One night, there was a heavy rain, and large rocks rolled down the mountain, damaging the KMT's garrison. They fired wildly for two hours and launched flares. The masses mocked, "Let's see how long your 'Central Army' can continue to run rampant!"

　　东北蒋区人民热盼我军解放
    【新华社东北二十九日】东北蒋管区人民处在水深火热中，正殷切盼望人民解放军之到来。锦州市贫民与知识青年及一般中小公务员因不堪忍受蒋家抓丁与苛捐杂税等暴政之压迫，均热望民主联军前往解救他们，他们中不少的人已逃来解放区之亲友家中。该地商捐税已增十倍，连一个提小篮子卖香烟的也得抽上万元的捐税。当民主联军出击时，所到之处，当地饱受灾难的同胞无不切要求土地改革，他们说：“同志：你们来了，我们有了靠山，只要你们不走，我们就敢与坏蛋算帐。”另据承德讯：七月初起，承德滦平等地蒋军，每天都出动三、四十辆汽车，把大批民脂民膏与家属运往内，并大量抛售衣物，致使市场混乱。现在该地蒋军已如惊弓之鸟，某日晚大雨倾盆，山上滚下来大石把蒋家守军坏了，乱打两个钟头，并发射照明弹，群众均嘲笑着：“看你‘中央军’还能横行到几时？”
