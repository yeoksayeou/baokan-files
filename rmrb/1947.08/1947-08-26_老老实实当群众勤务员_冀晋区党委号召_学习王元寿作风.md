　　Honestly and Earnestly Serving as a Quartermaster for the Masses
　　Hebei-Shanxi Regional Party Committee Calls for
　　Learning from Wang Yuanshou's Work Style
Xinhua News Agency, Jin-Cha-Ji, 21st—The CCP Hebei-Shanxi Regional Committee recently called on the entire party to learn from Comrade Wang Yuanshou's work style and methods, stating: Every time Comrade Wang Yuanshou arrives in a village, he first seeks out poor people and lives and eats with them. He also does his best to dress like the masses. He has established deep class feelings with the poor, who see him as "one of their own," telling him everything and holding nothing back. He can timely propose appropriate slogans to guide the masses to actively struggle. Therefore, wherever he goes, the mass movement develops vigorously, making him a model for finding and mobilizing poor people and guiding the masses to struggle. The call pointed out: This work style is precisely a new work style suitable for following the mass line. It is a reflection of the ideas of "honestly and earnestly serving as a quartermaster for the masses," the idea that "the masses are the masters," and the idea that "without poor peasant backbones, there is no genuine mass line." The call further pointed out: Many cadres still have the work style of putting on airs, talking boastfully without going deep among the masses. They reveal themselves everywhere as the "superiors" of the masses, envying "foreignization" and "aristocratization," forming a "special class" outside the masses. They are accustomed to simplistic coercion and issuing untimely slogans, and when tasks cannot be completed, they do not examine their own leadership but complain about the "stupidity" of the masses. The call stated: This work style cannot follow the mass line and victoriously complete land reform. It corrodes the Party and isolates it from the masses. This work style must be overcome. Finally, the call said: To learn from Comrade Wang Yuanshou's work style, first, we must use the spirit of rectification to examine and eradicate all non-mass viewpoints and non-mass line thinking and work styles, and clearly establish "the viewpoint of everything for the people, the viewpoint of being responsible to the people, the viewpoint of believing that the masses can liberate themselves, and the viewpoint of learning from the people." Second, a "four no dislikes" movement should be launched among cadres, namely "no dislike of bran rice, no dislike of ragged clothes, no dislike of torn mat, no dislike of lice bites," to experience and train from actual life. Third, comrades who have consistently been proactive, responsible, hardworking, and simple in the past should be commended in a timely manner. At the same time, comrades who have consistently used coercion and are stubbornly unrepentant in their thinking must be criticized and subjected to ideological struggle. Not only district and village cadres, but also leaders at all levels should learn from Comrade Wang Yuanshou and create a mass movement from top to bottom and from bottom to top.

　　老老实实当群众勤务员
  　冀晋区党委号召
  　学习王元寿作风
    【新华社晋察冀二十一日电】中共冀晋区党委，日前号召全党学习王元寿同志工作作风与方法称：王元寿同志每到一村，首先找贫苦群众，睡觉吃饭都同他们在一起，他的穿着也做到最大限度的群众化。他同穷人建立了浓厚的阶级感情，穷人把他看做“自己人”，无话不讲，无事不言。他能适时的提出恰如其份的口号，引导群众积极斗争，所以他走到那里，那里的群众运动便轰轰烈烈的开展起来，成为找穷汉发动穷汉及引导群众斗争的模范。号召中指出：这个作风正是适合于走群众路线的一套新作风，是“老老实实当群众勤务员”的思想和“群众是主人翁”的思想，以及“没有贫农骨干就没有真正的群众路线”思想的反映。号召中并进而指出：不少干部还存在着摆干部架子，夸夸其谈不深入群众的作风。他们处处显露是群众的“上司”羡慕“洋化”、“贵族化”，在群众之外形成“特殊阶层”，他们习惯于简单化的强迫命令，提出不适时的口号，而当任务不能完成时，不检查自己的领导，却埋怨群众的“愚蠢”。号召中说：这种作风是不能走群众路线与胜利完成土地改革的，它腐蚀了党，使党在群众中孤立起来。这种作风必须克服。最后号召中说：要学习王元寿同志的作风，第一、要以整风的精神去检查与根除一切非群众观点，非群众路线的思想作风，而明确的树立“一切为了人民群众的观点，一切向人民负责的观点，相信群众自己能解放自己的观点，向人民群众学习的观点”。第二、要在干部中展开四不嫌运动，即“不嫌糠饭，不嫌衣服破烂，不嫌铺破席片，不嫌虱蚤咬”从实际生活中去体验与锻炼。第三、要及时表扬过去一贯积极负责艰苦朴素的同志。同时必须对一贯强迫命令、思想上顽固不化的同志，予以批评和作思想斗争。不仅是区村干部，而各级领导同志均应向王元寿同志学习，造成自上而下和自下而上的群众性运动。
