　　The United States and Latin America
    The twenty Central and South American countries participating in this "Pan-American Conference" have a total area of ​​20.9 million square kilometers and a total population of 132 million. They are rich in products, especially some important resources, such as petroleum, with an annual output of 356 million barrels, ranking second in the world. Venezuela produces the most. However, more than 60 percent of the stock is held by Standard Oil Company. Other resources such as coffee account for 80 percent of the world's total output, flax 60 percent, silver 50 percent, antimony, copper, and leather 42 percent each, lead and iron 20 percent each, and sugar 25 percent, cocoa (beverage) 31 percent. Therefore, Latin America has always been a battleground for imperialists seeking colonies. Today, with the withdrawal of German and Japanese forces and the active exclusion of Britain by the United States, Latin America has almost become the exclusive raw material market, sales market, and investment market for the United States. The total amount of American investment in these countries was 2.8 billion U.S. dollars in 1940, and it has increased to 4 billion by the end of 1946. The interest flowing into the United States from South America every year is as high as 800 million U.S. dollars. The trade between the United States and Central and South America has also almost doubled compared to before the war. In 1944, exports reached 1.005 billion yuan, and imports reached 1.59 billion yuan. Among the twenty countries, Brazil is the largest and richest, and the United States is most covetous of Brazil. U.S. public and private investment in Brazil amounts to 750 million U.S. dollars, with annual interest income of 150 million U.S. dollars. Standard Oil Company holds 70 percent of the stock in Brazil's largest "National Petroleum Company". 42 percent of all industrial profits in Brazil flow into foreign banks.
    Although these twenty countries have great natural resources, most of them still remain in a semi-colonial and semi-feudal backward agricultural state under the feudal fascist rule of fascist or pro-fascist forces colluding with foreign imperialism. However, from World War II to the present, the national democratic movements in Latin American countries have developed extensively. This movement demands to get rid of the economic and political rule of foreign imperialism, first of all, to oppose the Pan-American military cooperation imposed by the United States, to nationalize foreign enterprises, to protect national industries with high tariffs, and to implement land reform. The backbone of this movement—the Communist Parties of Central and South American countries—has developed to have nearly 600,000 members, and the Communist Parties of nine countries have seats in parliament. For example, Brazil has 20 seats, Chile 17 seats, and Cuba 12 seats. The Latin American Labor Confederation has more than 4.5 million members. Today, the development of national democratic movements in Latin American countries depends on crushing the provocations and attacks of fascist reactionaries and strengthening the unity between the labor movement and various progressive parties.

　　美国与拉丁美洲
    这次参加“泛美会议”的中南美全部二十个国家，总面积是二千零九十万平方公里，总人口一万万三千二百万，物产丰富，尤其是若干重要资源，如石油一项年产三万万五千六百万桶，居世界第二位，其中委内瑞拉出产最多。但股票百分之六十以上都握在美孚油公司手中，其他如咖啡占世界总产量百分之八十，亚麻百分之六十，银百分之五十，锑、铜、皮革各占百分之四十二，铅、铁百分之二十，糖百分之二十五，可可（饮料）百分之三十一。因此，拉丁美洲一向成为帝国主义者追求殖民地的角逐场。今天，在德日势力退出、英国为美国积极排斥之下，拉丁美洲几乎已成为美国独占的原料市场、销售市场和投资市场。美国在这些国家的投资总额四○年是二十八亿美元，四六年底已增至四十亿；南美每年流入美国的利息，约达八亿美元之巨。美国对中南美的贸易比战前也几乎增加一倍。四四年输出达十万万五千万元，输入达十五万九千万元。二十个国家中，以巴西为最大最富，美国对巴西的垂涎也最甚。美在巴西之公私投资达七亿五千万元，每年收利息达一亿五千万元。美孚油公司握有巴西最大“国家石油公司”股票百分之七十。巴西一切工业利润百分之四十二要流入外国银行。
    这二十个国家虽有极大的天然富源，但在法西斯势力或亲法西斯势力勾结外国帝国主义实行封建法西斯统治下，至今大部仍停留在半殖民地半封建落后的农业国家状态中。然而，自二次世界大战到现在，拉丁美洲各国的民族民主运动有了广泛的发展。这个运动要求摆脱外国帝国主义的经济政治统治，首先是反对美国所强加的泛美军事合作，实行外国企业国有化，以高额关税保护民族工业，实行土地改革。这个运动的中坚——中南美各国的共产党，已发展到拥有近六十万党员，且有九个国家的共产党，在议会中拥有议席。如巴西有二十席，智利十七席，古巴十二席。拉丁美洲劳工联合会员拥有四百五十余万会员。今天拉丁美洲各国民族民主运动之发展，有赖于粉碎法西斯反动派挑拨进攻，加强职工运动中与各进步政党间的团结。（新华社陕北十八日电）
