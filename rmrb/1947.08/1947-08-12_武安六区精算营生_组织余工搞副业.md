　　[Report from our newspaper in Wu'an] The Sixth District is promoting a meticulous calculation style, carefully calculating the amount of livelihood, labor usage, and labor force, and then organizing the remaining labor force to engage in sideline occupations, striving to achieve "cultivating for three, surplus for one."

　　The movement first started in Sha Luo Village. According to calculations in Sha Luo, the village has 2,400 mu of land, half paddy and half dry land. Paddy fields require weeding two, three, or four times, using three workdays per mu. Dry land requires hoeing one, two, or three times, needing five workdays per mu. In total, weeding requires 8,600 workdays. The entire village has 217 full and semi-laborers. In the 75 days before the autumn harvest, they have a total labor force of 16,765 workdays. After deducting 8,600 workdays for weeding, plus miscellaneous work such as planting vegetables, rainy days, and supporting public service, there is a net surplus of 4,000 workdays, accounting for one-fourth of the total labor force. This means each laborer in the village cultivates eleven mu of land, while in other twenty-plus villages above Huoshui Village, each laborer cultivates only five mu of land, resulting in even more surplus labor. Even in Dongxi Jing Village, which has relatively less surplus labor (each person cultivates thirteen mu of land, and the first weeding has not yet been done), there is still one-fifth surplus labor. Thus, organizing the surplus labor to engage in sideline occupations to strive to achieve "cultivating for three, surplus for one" is the major problem currently facing production leadership. After this calculation, the slogan was put forward: "Use whatever skills you have, organize yourselves, increase income. Stir the three-tenths of wealth, wealth doesn't come if you don't act. Eight Immortals cross the sea, each displays their unique abilities." Sideline occupations are now being vigorously developed. The avenues are selling wood and stone, selling fruit trees, doing short-term labor, selling dry firewood, selling grain, and working for the public. According to statistics from only nine villages including Dahui, they have already earned 100,500 yuan, which can buy 13,417 jin of corn. All villagers, 154 people, can each get an average of 87.5 jin of grain. In addition, the entire district has lent 28,700 jin of cotton, which can definitely be completed before autumn, earning 240,000 jin of millet. Now we have enough confidence to hoe the land and reclaim wasteland, and strive to achieve "cultivating for three, surplus for one." (Shang Ting, De Yu, Lu Lin)

　　武安六区精算营生
  　组织余工搞副业
    【本报武安讯】六区推行精确计算作风，算营生多少，用工多少，劳力多少，然后组织剩余劳力搞副业，为实现耕三余一而努力。
    运动首先从沙洛村开始，据沙洛计算，全村土地二千四百亩，水旱各占一半，水地苗再锄二、三、四遍，每亩用工三个，旱地锄头、二、三遍，每亩需工五个，共计锄地需工八千六百个，全村全半劳力二百一十七名，到秋收前七十五天，共劳力一万六千七百六十五个，除锄地用工八千六百个，加上种菜、下雨天、支差等杂工，尚净余四千个工，占全部劳力四分之一。这是该村每个劳力种地合十一亩，而在活水村以上其他二十多个村，每个劳力只合五亩地，剩余劳力就更多，就是比较剩余劳力少的东西井村（每人种地十三亩，头遍苗未锄），也有五分之一剩余劳力。这样组织剩余劳力搞副业争取实现耕三余一，就是当前领导生产的大问题。从这样计算后，随提出口号，“有啥本事，使啥本事，组织起来，增加收入，动动三分财，不动财不来，八仙过海，各显其能”。现在副业正大力开展，门道是贩木石，卖果木，打短工，贩干柴，贩粮食，给公家做工，现仅大会等九村统计，已现洋十万零五千元，可买玉茭一万三千四百一十七斤，全村人有一百五十四人，每人可平均得到粮食八十七斤半。另外，全区贷花二万八千七百斤，秋前定可全部完成，可赚到小米二十四万斤。现在我们有足够的信心可以锄地开荒，而且要争取实现耕三余一。（尚亭、德玉、鲁林）
