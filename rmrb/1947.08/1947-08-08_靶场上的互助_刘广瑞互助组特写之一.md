    Mutual Assistance on the Firing Range
    A Feature on the Liu Guangrui Mutual Aid Group, Part One

    Zhang Guozhi had never fired a gun before. The moment he saw a blank cartridge being loaded into the gun, he would tremble and dare not proceed. Liu Guangrui would take out the bullet and have him practice aiming and moving with an empty gun. After doing this a few times, without Zhang knowing, Liu Guangrui would put the bullet back in and push it into the chamber, still teaching him to aim as before. He checked the sight, corrected the deviation, and told him to hold his breath, pull the trigger, and fire. Unexpectedly, the bullet hit the paper target. At that moment, Zhang Guozhi was both surprised and delighted. He was surprised by the loud noise of the gun and the puff of black smoke, but delighted that shooting wasn't so scary after all. Moreover, the bullet had hit the target! From then on, Zhang Guozhi became interested in shooting. During his afternoon nap, he would secretly go out with Guo Zhongtai to shoot empty cartridges. If he didn't fire a couple of shots, he would feel itchy and unable to sleep. Liu Guangrui didn't even shoot his own empty shells, "supporting" Zhang Guozhi instead. In this way, Zhang Guozhi developed his skills and courage, making rapid progress.

    Before the first shooting practice, the team put forward the slogan of striving for "three shots, two hits" to "earn team merit." However, when Zhang Guozhi's first bullet went wild, he was dejected. The group comforted him, saying, "You didn't even dare to shoot empty shells in the past, but now you dare to shoot real bullets. That's a victory! The first shot is to test the gun and get a feel for its temperament." "A good general doesn't fight the first battle, and the best food isn't in the first dish. The first shot doesn't count, we'll see next time!"

    Under everyone's encouragement and mutual assistance in diligent practice and research, Zhang Guozhi's skills improved very quickly, with empty shells hitting above the sixth ring. Before the second shooting practice, Guo Zhongtai and Liu Guangrui encouraged Zhang Guozhi, saying:

    "How about this time?"
    Zhang said, "This time I have full confidence, I'll definitely hit the target, no more wild shots!"
    "Really? Do you mean it?"
    "Of course, if I have a wild shot, I'll spend 200 yuan to buy peanuts and treat everyone."

    They clapped hands, signed their names, and Liu Guangrui, Guo Zhongtai, and Zhang Guozhi said, "If you hit the target, we'll all stand at attention and salute you to welcome you."

    The whole group happily entered the firing range with confidence in victory. When they arrived at the firing range, no one mentioned wild shots or buying peanuts! ... Liu Guangrui wet a towel with cold water and wiped Zhang Guozhi's eyes, who was about to start shooting, and whispered, "Just calm your breath and master the key point, you'll definitely hit the target. The whole group is responsible for the results, good or bad, and we won't complain. You can relax and be bold." These words dispelled Zhang Guozhi's concerns, allowing him to calmly and peacefully focus on shooting.

    Sure enough, two shots, two hits, both were red flags, sixteen rings total. When they returned, the whole group saluted Zhang Guozhi to congratulate him. Zhang Guozhi smiled broadly, and everyone was also smiling. This was the victory of mutual assistance, the glory of the whole group. Before the third shooting practice, they shouted the resounding slogan, "Resolutely avoid wild shots, strive for the red flag to earn team merit!" Sure enough, all three members of the group hit the target with all nine bullets, completing and exceeding the educational plan.

    靶场上的互助
    刘广瑞互助组特写之一
    新丰
    张国治是没有打过枪的，一看见枪膛压上空壳子弹，就浑身哆嗦的不敢出发了。刘广瑞就把子弹取出，让他用空枪练习瞄准出发，作了几次，不让他知道，就放进子弹推上了膛，还是教他按老样子瞄准，并检查了观察镜，纠正了偏差，叫他闭气引枪击发，子弹冷不防的打中了纸靶。这时张国治又惊又喜，惊的是枪声一响，冒出一股黑烟，喜的是打枪也不过如此，并不可怕。而且子弹还上了靶了，从此以后张国治对打枪发生了兴趣，午睡时偷偷和郭仲台出去打空弹壳，要是不打上一两发，心里直发痒，睡不着，刘广瑞自己的空炮壳都不打，“拥护”给张国治，就是这样使张国治锻练了技术和胆量，进步飞快。
    在第一次打靶前，队里提出争取三发两中“立队功”的口号，可是当张国治第一发子弹吃了烧饼，便垂头丧气，小组里就安慰他说：“你过去连空炮弹都不敢打，现在敢打真枪了，这就是胜利，头一枪是试枪，摸摸枪的脾气”，“好将不在头一仗，好吃不在头一盘，头枪不算下次再看！”
    张国治在大家的安慰鼓励之下，高兴起来了，经一天的互助苦练研究，张国治的技术进步的非常快，空炮弹都打在六环以上。第二次打靶前，郭仲台、刘广瑞，都向张国治鼓励说：
    “这次怎么样？”
    张说：“这次我有充分信心，保险上靶，不吃烧饼！”
    “真的吗？算话吗？”
    “当然算话，要是吃了大烧饼，我拿二百元买花生请客”。
    当时拍了巴掌，签了字，刘广瑞、郭仲台、张国治说：“要是你中了靶，我们都向你立正敬礼，欢迎你。”
    全组都高高兴兴带着胜利信心进了靶场，到了靶场，大家都不提吃烧饼买花生了！…………刘广瑞用凉水湿了手巾，给即将开始射击的张国治擦眼睛，并且低声的说：“只要沉着气，掌握一元化，保险打上靶；成绩好坏，全组负责，决不埋怨，你放心大胆好了”。这几句话，解除了张国治的思想顾虑，心平气和的安心射击了。
    果然不错，两发两中，都是红旗，二八十六环。回来时全组向张国治敬礼致贺，张国治笑迷了，大家都笑眯眯地。这是互助的胜利，全组的光荣，第三次打靶前，他们喊出了响亮的口号“坚决不吃黑烧饼，争取红旗立队功！”果然不错，全组三个人打了九发子弹，都命中了，完成并超过了教育计划。
