Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 15th. Jiang-controlled area conscripts, unwilling to be cannon fodder for the Jiang bandits' civil war, are fleeing in large numbers. According to reports from Associated Press and TASS Shanghai on the 13th, over the past few weeks, new recruits seized from various parts of Zhejiang and transferred to the North China war zone via Shanghai have been escaping in large numbers. Officers escorting the new recruits are arbitrarily seizing young people near the pier in the Nanhui mountainous area near the Huangpu River, where troop transport ships are docked, to fill the vacancies, causing great unease among Shanghai citizens. Furthermore, according to a Shanghai newspaper report on the 30th of last month, more than a thousand conscripts from eastern Hubei arrived in Nanjing by boat from Wuhan and were then transported by train from Nanjing to Shanghai for training in late last month. When passing through Henglin Station (located southeast of Changzhou on the Shanghai-Nanjing Railway), sixteen of them jumped off the train to avoid military service. Because the train was still moving at high speed, a tragedy occurred, with four people killed on the spot, seven seriously injured, and five slightly injured escaping.

Xinhua News Agency, East China Front, 15th. During the Linqu city blocking battle in the last ten days of last month, Zhao Heqing and five others from the First Company of the 309th Regiment of the 103rd Brigade of Jiang's 8th Division, carrying one machine gun and five rifles, staged a battlefield uprising. According to Zhao, Shandong villagers who were conscripted by Jiang's army all want to find opportunities to defect to the Liberated Areas. Zhao and the others are all from Ye County.

　　蒋兵不愿内战纷纷逃亡临朐战役六人战场起义
    【新华社陕北十五日电】蒋管区被抓新兵因不愿为蒋贼当内战炮灰，纷纷逃亡。据美联社及塔斯社上海十三日电报导：过去数周内自浙江各地所抓新兵源源转运华北战区路经上海时，逃定甚多。管押新兵的军官，就在南汇山区靠近黄浦江停泊运兵船的码头附近，随便强抓青年填补空额，此事引起上海市民极大的不安。又据上月三十日沪报载，鄂东被征新兵千余人，自汉乘轮抵南京，旋又于上月下旬由南京乘车至上海受训，途经横林车站（位于京沪路上常州东南）时，其中十六人为逃避兵役而跳车，因车仍在急速前进之中，致发生惨剧，四人当场毙命，七人受重伤，五人轻伤逃脱。
    【新华社华东前线十五日电】上月下旬临朐城区阻击战中，蒋军第八师一○三旅三○九团第一连赵和卿等六人携机枪一挺，步枪五支，举行战场起义。据赵谈：被蒋军抓去当兵的山东老乡，都想找机会投奔解放区。赵等均为掖县人。
