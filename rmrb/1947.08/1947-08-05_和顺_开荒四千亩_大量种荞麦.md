Reclaiming 4,000 Mu of Wasteland
Planting Buckwheat on a Large Scale
[Our newspaper Heshun dispatch] At the public meeting of the Heshun Party, the County Party Committee called on the entire county to urgently mobilize, overcome the famine, and the Party members should lead the masses to perform meritorious service for the people. Cadres and Party members in various places actively responded, guiding the masses to break with the paralysis and waiting-for-rain mentality. Various regions of the county have acted one after another. Six villages in the third district, including Songyan and Leizhuang, used the Qinghe River to dig canals for irrigation. Leizhuang even opened a canal eight li long. These villages have now irrigated more than 2,000 mu of land, and plan to irrigate more than 4,000 mu. More than ten villages in the first district, including Baiquan and Renguohan, organized more than 1,000 people and irrigated 440 mu of land in one day. The division of labor was clear: men carried water, women watered the seedlings, and measures were taken to water from the top down or to bury the soil with water. Saving has been widely carried out throughout the county. The masses said: "We are not afraid of lean years, but we are afraid of consecutive years of drought; a trickle of water will not worry about drought." The masses in Quanmaping said: "Save a handful of rice per meal, the days cannot be calculated for long. If one person saves half a he of rice a day, half a jin of rice will be saved in two days." Dozens of villages, including Shutou, eat thin porridge in the morning, vegetable wowo (steamed corn bread) at noon, and thin soup in the evening, and practice strict economy. In addition, the collection of wild fruits and vegetables has become more widespread. Only 116 men and women were organized in Pingdichuan Village, and they collected 1 shi and 5 dou and 8 sheng of mountain peach kernels in one day. A total of 30,000 jin of wild vegetables were collected in eleven villages in the first district. Eliminating cultivated wasteland and rushing to plant buckwheat and eliminating pests has formed a movement throughout the county, especially in eight villages including Baiquan in the first district, where a total of 2,500 mu of wasteland has been reclaimed. Planting 3 dou of buckwheat per mu can increase grain by 700 shi. Sanquan Village in the first district plowed 458 mu of cultivated wasteland in four days, and plans to plant buckwheat and vegetables as soon as it rains. Nine households in Xinzhuang reclaimed six mu of wasteland, and are still reclaiming it, each household wants to plant one mu of vegetables. A total of more than 4,000 mu of wasteland has been reclaimed above. Now the whole county is vigorously rushing to plant, eliminating cultivated wasteland, replanting vacancies, continuing to carry water to irrigate fields, practicing strict economy, and vigorously collecting wild vegetables.
