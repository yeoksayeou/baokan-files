    Xinhua News Agency, Jin-Lu-Yu Front, 7th. Over fifteen hundred civilians, captured by Chiang Kai-shek's 66th Division to build fortifications, were completely rescued by the People's Liberation Army in the Yangshanji battle. During their eighteen days of captivity, they were driven to the front lines to build fortifications in a constant state of hunger. According to civilian Xia Zhanqi: whenever there was fighting, they would be driven out of the shelters that had already been dug, while the Chiang Kai-shek soldiers would crawl in themselves, forcing the civilians to dig new fortifications under artillery fire. Many civilians were forced to sacrifice themselves. Xia Zhanqi and others, unable to bear the hunger, found a small melon and some bran in a local villager's house in Yangshanji to make soup, but it was also taken away by the Chiang Kai-shek soldiers. After these civilians were liberated, they were all ashen-faced and in a semi-sick state. After the People's Liberation Army provided them with food and medical treatment, they joyfully returned to their homes.

    羊山集战斗中解放民夫千余
    【新华社冀鲁豫前线七日电】被蒋军六十六师捉去修筑工事的一千五百名民夫，在羊山集战斗中为解放军全部解救，他们在被捕去的十八天内，整日在饥饿中被驱到火线修筑工事，据民夫夏占奇称：每遇战斗，就把他们撵出已挖好之掩蔽洞外，而蒋军自己钻进去，让民夫冒着炮火另挖工事，很多民夫被迫作了牺牲。夏占奇等饥饿难忍，从羊山集一家老百姓屋子里找到一个小瓜和一点麸子做汤喝，也被蒋军夺去吃了，这些民夫被解放后，个个面如土色，已在半病状态，经解放军给以饮食医治后，喜气洋洋各自回家。
