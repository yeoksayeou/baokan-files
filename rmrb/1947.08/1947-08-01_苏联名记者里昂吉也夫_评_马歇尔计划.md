Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, July 27th: TASS reports: The famous Soviet journalist Leontev recently wrote an article commenting on the "Marshall Plan," stating that it is correct to call the "Marshall Plan" a "rehash of the Dawes Plan." Because the emergence of both is the result of the difficulties encountered by the American economy due to the war, both are based on turning European countries into slaves of American monopoly capital, and both aim to split the economic independence and political sovereignty of European countries. The difference is that Germany acted as a broker for the Dawes Plan, while Britain and France are the brokers for the "Marshall Plan." The "Marshall Plan" also gives West Germany a significant position, requiring it to become a base for American economic aggression in Europe and to be used to store weapons in preparation for future adventures. Leontev finally pointed out that due to the refusal of countries such as Poland and Czechoslovakia to participate, and the fact that other European countries are unwilling to sell their national dignity and future like commodities in the market, the Marshall Plan will inevitably suffer failure. (Note: The so-called Dawes Plan was formulated by American Vice President Dawes in 1924, with the aim of importing foreign capital to revive German production and ordering it to pay reparations to various countries in five years to solve the difficulties in American debt collection caused by German inflation and suspension of reparations. However, as a result, by the end of 1928, Germany was heavily indebted due to this plan, which deepened the economic crisis, and the Dawes Plan failed.)

Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, July 29th: TASS New York: Overseas news agencies broadcast an article by Laski, former chairman of the British Labour Party Executive Committee, denouncing the "Marshall Plan," stating that if Marshall's proposal is accepted by the countries participating in the European Economic Recovery Conference, the economies of these countries will become the economy of the United States, becoming the largest market for American exports, and at the same time will cause political consequences. We already have the example of the consequences in Greece, where, under the name of Greek independence, American loans have consolidated the counter-revolution. Laski pointed out that the American reconstruction of Germany will sooner or later lead to a separate peace with Germany, which cannot but lead to the rearmament of the world, the United Nations will suffer failure, and world peace will be undermined. Laski urged Western European countries to carefully consider the conditions of American "aid." He painfully said: "We should further consider that the United States favors open doors abroad, while adopting a closed door policy at home; we should not accept recovery conditions that make Western Europe an outer region of the United States. We should carefully consider the situation when Britain accepted the first American loan, which was a very harsh transaction, which not only severely restricted the freedom of our economic activities, but also caused us to lose 30 percent of the original value of the loan due to the rise in American prices." However, while explaining the dangers of the Marshall Plan, Laski also issued a hostile statement against the "Soviet bloc."

    苏联名记者里昂吉也夫
    评“马歇尔计划”
    【新华社陕北二十七日电】塔斯社讯：著名苏联记者里昂吉也夫顷著文评论“马歇尔计划”称：“马歇尔计划”被称为“道威斯计划的翻版”是正确的。因为两者的产生，均系美国经济因战争所遭遇的困难的结果，均以变欧洲国家为美国独占资本之奴隶为基础，并以分裂欧洲国家之经济独立和政治主权为目的。所不同的，道威斯计划系由德国充当掮客，而“马歇尔计划”的掮客则是英法。“马歇尔计划”中给予德国西部的地位也不小，要求它成为美国侵略欧洲经济的基地，并用以置放武器，以备将来各种冒险之用。里氏最后指出：由于波捷等国的拒绝参加，及欧洲其他国家并不愿将其国家的尊严的前途如商品一样在市场出售，将使马歇尔计划一定遭受失败。（按：所谓道威斯计划，系一九二四年时由美国副总统道威斯来拟定，其目的在输入外资以复兴德国生产，并令其对各国赔款分五年支付，以解决因德国通货膨胀、赔偿停付而引起的美国收债困难。但结果德国至一九二八年末，反因此计划负债累累而加深经济危机，道威斯计划遂告失败。）
    【新华社陕北二十九日】塔斯社纽约讯：海外通讯社播出前英工党执委会主席拉斯基一文，斥“马歇尔计划”称：倘若马歇尔之提议为参加欧洲经济复兴会议的国家所接受，这些国家的经济将成为美国的经济，变成美国出口的最大市场，同时还会引起政治的后果。我们已经有了希腊后果的例子，在为希腊独立的名义下，美国的贷款巩固了反革命。拉氏指出：美国的重建德国，迟早会引导到对德单独媾和，不能不使世界重整军备，联合国将遭受失败，而破坏世界和平。拉氏力主西欧国家要慎重的考虑美国“援助”的条件，他惨痛的说：“我们应该进一步的考虑到美国是赞成国外门户开放，而国内则采门户紧闭的政策；我们不应接受使西欧成为美国外围区域的复兴条件。应当仔细想想英国接受美第一次贷款的情形，那是一种很苛刻的交易，不但严重地限制了我们经济活动的自由，而且由于美国的物价上涨，致使我们损失了贷款原来价值的百分之三十。”但拉斯基在说明马歇尔计划之危险性同时，却又发表了反对“苏联集团”的含有敌意的声明。
