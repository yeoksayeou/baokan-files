Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 27th: Moscow dispatch: The News recently published an article commenting on the Indonesian situation after the breakdown of British-Dutch negotiations, stating: "The development of the Indonesian situation once again exposes the hypocrisy of the Netherlands and other imperialists' promises of autonomy and independence to colonial peoples. The Netherlands signed the Linggadjati Agreement to buy time." In discussing the Netherlands' true intentions, the report stated: "The Netherlands wants Indonesia to participate in a puppet regime and then plunder all enterprises and plantations, and control foreign trade. The Republic strives for a peaceful resolution, agreeing to make some concessions in terms of government organization and financial power, but outright refuses to hand over the police responsible for defending the Republic's security to the Netherlands." The commentary concludes: "The Netherlands' war policy is fully supported by the United States and Britain."
    Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 29th: Comprehensive report: For a week, war has raged across the islands of Indonesia. On Java, the Dutch invading forces, using Batavia, Semarang, and Surabaya as bases, advanced along the railway trunk lines in three directions, with the main attack aimed at the Indonesian capital, Yogyakarta, while attempting to regain control of Java's main transportation arteries and divide the Indonesian liberated areas. As of the 26th, Dutch troops had occupied several towns, including Malang, and had advanced to within twenty miles of Yogyakarta. However, the Indonesian People's Army conducted a heroic resistance, and since the 23rd, they have launched local counter-offensives in the east, west, and central directions, achieving continuous victories. Yogyakarta was relieved on the 24th, and the city of Siwo Sari (note that this area is one of Indonesia's well-equipped air bases; the liberation of this city has cleared out the enemies of Malang) and nearly ten other important bases, large and small, have been recovered. According to an Associated Press dispatch from Batavia on the 27th: The Indonesian people launched a counter-offensive, firing a large amount of artillery, and Indonesian guerrillas are active on Dutch military strongholds and transportation lines. On Sumatra, the center of the war remains in the south, and the battle for the oil field area near Palembang is unfolding.
