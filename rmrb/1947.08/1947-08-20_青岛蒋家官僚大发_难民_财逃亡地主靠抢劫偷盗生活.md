Xinhua News Agency, Shandong, 18th: According to Qingdao newspapers, landlords who were lured from the liberated areas to Qingdao by Chiang Kai-shek's secret agents have become tools for the Chiang Kai-shek clique bureaucrats to make a fortune from "relief." These so-called "refugees," numbering 21,000, are living an inhuman existence. Since the so-called "Shantung Refugee Relief Committee" was established in March, the public figures in the committee's work report alone show that it received 10,000 bags of wheat, more than 3,000 bags of flour, and thousands of bags of other grains from the Chiang Kai-shek Executive Headquarters' Shandong-Qingdao office. It also extorted 240.01 million yuan from all walks of life in the name of "donations." However, all these grains and funds went into the pockets of the Kuomintang officials; the "refugees" rely on selling their daughters and sons, begging, and stealing to survive. The Qingdao village district chief admitted in his report on the "refugee" situation: "Since the refugees were taken in last year, they have never received any relief. For several months, they have relied entirely on robbery and theft to survive." Because the officials all wanted to make a fortune from the "refugees," they fought with each other. The "Shantung Refugee Relief Committee" was exclusively controlled by the Chiang Kai-shek Qingdao Municipal Social Bureau, making it difficult for other parties to intervene, and has been announced dissolved. In addition, Chiang Kai-shek's Qingdao Mayor Li Xianliang invited Huan, the director of the Chiang Kai-shek Executive Headquarters' Shandong-Qingdao branch, and others, to form the "Qingdao Refugee Temporary Relief Committee" on June 15th, obtaining a large amount of materials from the Executive Headquarters, including 1,000 tons of miscellaneous grains, 5,000 large bags of flour, 40,000 yards of cloth, and 4,000 cans of canned food. Furthermore, they levied more than 400 million yuan in "relief funds." However, the so-called "refugees" are still forced to cut down trees to build fortifications in exchange for a half-starved existence. At the same time, the "Refugee Relief Association" published an advertisement in the "Military and Civilian Daily" on July 5th to auction 50,000 catties of millet and 10,000 catties of sorghum, which were meant as relief grain.

　　青岛蒋家官僚大发“难民”财逃亡地主靠抢劫偷盗生活
    【新华社山东十八日电】据青岛报载：被蒋介石特务诱骗自解放区逃到青岛的地主，已成为蒋家官僚大发“救济财”的工具。这些为数达二万一千的所谓“难民”都过着非人生活。自所谓“鲁东难胞救济委员会”于三月成立后，仅该会工作报告之公开数字，即自蒋记行总鲁青帅领到小麦一万包，面粉三千余袋，及其他杂粮数千包等，并以“捐款”名义向各界勒索了二亿四千零一万元。但所有这些粮款都装了国民党官老爷的腰包；“难民”们则依靠卖女鬻子，和行乞偷盗维持生活。青岛村庄区区长于报告“难民”情况时即供认：“难民们自去年被收容以来，从未得到丝毫救济，数月来完全靠抢劫偷盗维持生活。”因为老爷们大家都想发“难民”财，结果你争我夺，“鲁东难胞救济委员会”而为蒋记青市社会局所独霸，各方染指不易，已被宣布解散。另有蒋记青市市长李先良邀请包括蒋记行总鲁青分署署长缓某在内，于六月十五日组成“青岛难胞临时救济委员会”，自行总取得大量物资，包括杂粮一千吨，面粉五千大包，布匹四万码，罐头四千听，另外还征收“救济金”等四亿余元。而所谓“难民”却依然被迫着要去砍伐树木构筑工事等，来换得半饥不饱的生活。同时“难胞救济会”则在七月五日的“军民日报”上大登拍卖救济粮小米五万斤，高粱一万斤的广告。
