Xinhua News Agency, Central China, 29th—Nearly three thousand farmers from Huanghai and Funing Counties in eastern Jiangsu Province, behind enemy lines, are currently repairing the Songgong and Huacheng seawalls under the leadership of the democratic government, averting the danger of autumn tidal floods for over 100,000 residents along the coast. During the repair period, they were repeatedly strafed by Chiang Kai-shek's warships. The embankment workers, undeterred by the danger, braved the scorching sun, torrential rain, and sea winds to rush the repairs. After thirteen days of hard work, they have completed one dangerous section and repaired over 70 *li* of the embankment. The Songgong Embankment was originally the northern section of the Fangong Embankment. During the rule of De Qin, the former Chairman of the Jiangsu Provincial Government under Chiang Kai-shek, it was neglected for many years, resulting in the tragic deaths of thousands of people during the tsunami of the 28th year of the Republic of China. After the establishment of the democratic government in the 29th year of the Republic, Song Naide, the county magistrate of Funing, personally led the coastal masses in a vigorous effort to repair it. The elders of the coastal areas therefore named it the Songgong Embankment, and the playwright A Ying even wrote a play about it.

　　苏北三千农民抢修宋公大堤
    【新华社华中二十九日电】苏北蒋后黄海阜（宁）东县三千余农民近在民主政府领导抢修宋公、华成两挡海大堤，解除海滨十余万居民秋季大海潮泛滥危险。抢修期内，曾遭蒋舰多次机枪扫射，堤工们仍不避危险，冒着烈日暴雨海风抢修，经十三天苦斗，已完成险工一处，修竣大堤七十余里。宋公堤原为范公堤之北段，前蒋记江苏省主席德勤统治苏北期间，多年失修，曾成民国二十八年大海啸淹死数千人之惨剧。二十九年民主政府建立后，我阜宁县长宋乃德亲率沿海群众奋力修复，海滨父老因而命名为宋公堤，剧作家阿英曾为此编有剧本。
