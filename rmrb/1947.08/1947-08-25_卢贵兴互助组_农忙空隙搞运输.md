The Lu Guixing Mutual Aid Team
　　Engages in Transportation During Agricultural Downtime
　　[This newspaper's report from JiluYu on the 22nd] The Lu Xinggui Mutual Aid Team of Jiang Kongtianlou in the Fifth District of Weihe combines production, war support, and transportation effectively. Earning 140,000 yuan per transport trip encouraged the enthusiasm of other production teams, and transportation became active throughout the village immediately. The Lu Guixing team has twelve laborers, five livestock, and 260 mu of land. With mutual aid production, the work in the fields was quickly completed. During a review, one member of the team was sent to the front lines as a stretcher bearer. The rest of the team had no work to do, so they held a meeting and decided to engage in transportation. They immediately allocated two laborers, one cart, and two livestock to transport rapeseed to the northwest. At that time, they had no capital. After inquiring, they learned that wheat was expensive in the west. They took out the wheat from their own homes and used it as shares, collecting more than four shi of wheat. They sold the wheat, bought rapeseed, and returned in seven days. They processed the rapeseed into oil, used the oil cakes as fertilizer, and sold the oil for subsequent capital. Within twelve days, after deducting travel expenses, they made a net profit of 140,000 yuan. This was both profitable and did not interfere with production, stimulating other mutual aid teams. The whole village quickly allocated five carts to participate in specialized transportation within the mutual aid teams. The village chief's team had livestock and immediately raised 130,000 yuan of shares to buy a mule. The whole village's production enthusiasm was unprecedentedly high, and they all seized the agricultural downtime to concentrate their efforts on participating in transportation.

　　卢贵兴互助组
  　农忙空隙搞运输
    【本报冀鲁豫二十二日电】卫河五区蒋孔田楼卢兴贵互助组生产、战勤、运输结合得好。运输一次赚洋十四万元，鼓励了其他生产组情绪，全村运输立时活跃起来。卢贵兴组共有十二个劳动力，牲口五头，地二百六十亩，在互助生产下，地里活很快就做完了。复查中，该组抬担架去前方一人，其余的人都没了活做，就开了个会，决定搞运输，当即抽出两个劳力、一辆大车、两个牲口，往西北去拉菜籽。当时没有本钱，大家一打听，知道西边的麦子贵，便将自己家里的麦子拿出来入股，共集四石多麦子，将麦卖了买回菜子，来回七天，将菜子打成油，油饼上地，油卖了作下次本钱，十二天内除去路费净赚洋十四万元。这样又得利，又不误生产，刺激了其他互助组，全村很快就抽了五辆大车参加互助组内专门运输，村长那一组有牲口，马上又集了十三万元的股本，买了个骡子。全村生产情绪空前高涨，都抓紧农业空隙集中力量参加运输。
