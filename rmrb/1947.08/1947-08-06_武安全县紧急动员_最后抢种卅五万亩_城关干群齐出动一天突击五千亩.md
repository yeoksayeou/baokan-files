    【This newspaper's report from Wu'an】 With the exception of planting in the mountainous areas of Wu'an County (and the Eleventh District, which still has 25 hectares unplanted), more than half of the flatlands in the First, Second, Third, Fourth, and Eighth Districts have not been planted, totaling at least 350,000 mu. The entire county received rain on the 28th, exceeding four fingers in depth. Thus, completing the planting of all 350,000 mu of land has become an urgent task. In addition to instructing unplanted areas to rush planting quickly, emphasizing that the season waits for no one, and preventing continuous rainy days to resolutely eliminate barren land, the county leadership has also dispatched eight cadres to assist in leading planting in the Second, Third, and Eighth Districts. Each district and village also held meetings during the rainfall to discuss and dispel the masses' wavering thoughts on planting. Some believed that planting was not guaranteed, fearing it would interfere with other work, preferring to find other methods early on, such as taking short-term jobs or planting wheat after the autumn. The idea of "late planting, late harvest; no planting of a hundred mu, no harvest of a hundred stones; one more dou of grain harvested, one month of famine avoided" was put forward to encourage the masses to plant. Besides resolving ideological issues, seed inspections and selections were conducted, and the organization was studied. As soon as the rain stopped, a wave of planting began. Two hundred and sixty staff members from the county-level agencies and state-owned shops, and four hundred elementary school teachers attending training classes, also suspended work and study to participate in the planting campaign with the masses in the city and township. Most of the streets in the city and township had one animal pulling a seed drill, one person operating the drill, one person leading the animal to help with the drill, and one person pulling a roller as a group, planting in sections and segments. Others whose seedlings were incomplete actively replanted. The method of calculating accounts for planting is based on the land area, with one jin of rice per mu planted. One drill can plant at least twenty mu a day, with some planting thirty-five mu. The rice earned is divided with the livestock receiving 40% to 50%, the drill operator receiving 30% to 50%, and the assistant receiving 20%. This has greatly boosted everyone's enthusiasm, especially in areas where mutual aid had not been accounted for in the past. After implementing this method, the masses showed great vigor, finally realizing that mutual aid was not just providing substitute labor, nor was it a confusing account. Accounting for planting is done by flexibly assessing and determining wages based on the amount of labor available at the time, and then the participants share the wages. According to a summary of planting in the Third District of the city and township in one day, of the more than 8,000 mu of unplanted land, 5,500 mu have been planted. It is estimated that it will be completed in two to three days at most. After planting, it has been decided to conduct a general inspection to see if there is still any barren land left and to resolutely eliminate it. To eliminate barren land, the government announced that anyone who cultivates barren land that was not planted last year will be rewarded with three years of exemption from burdens, and the land rights will belong to the cultivator, with taxes and deeds reduced by half compared to ordinary land.

    武安全县紧急动员
    最后抢种卅五万亩
    城关干群齐出动一天突击五千亩
    【本报武安讯】武安全县除山川区下种外（十一区也还有二十五顷未种），一、二、三、四、八区平地，均有一半以上土地未下种，为数至少在三十五万亩以上，二十八号全县普雨，均在四指以上，这样，最后全部完成三十五万亩土地下种，成为紧急任务。县领导上除指示未下种地区要快抢种，节令不等人，防止连阴天，坚决消灭荒地，当前下种仍以粮食为主外，并抽出八个干部，分到二、三、八区帮助领导下种。各区村也都在下雨时就集会讨论，打破群众下种动摇思想，有的认为种上也不保险，怕误工，不如趁早想别的法，不如打短工，不如秋后种麦等，提出晚种晚收，种上就收；不种百亩，不打百石；多打一斗粮，能渡一月荒，鼓励群众下种。除解决思想外，并进行种籽检查和选种，更研究了如何组织等问题，雨一停止立即卷入下种热潮。县直属机关干杂人员和公营商店有二百六十人，小学教员训练班四百人也停止工作学习，参加了城关群众的下种运动。城关各街多半是一个牲口拉耧，一人摇耧，一人牵牲口帮耧，一人拉砘为一小组，分片、分段进行下种，其余苗不全的都纷纷补种。对下种算帐办法，是按地亩算，种一亩地一斤米，一天一张耧至少种二十亩，有种三十五亩的，所得米牲口按十分之四、五算，摇耧按三、五算，帮耧按二分计，这样大家情绪很高，尤其过去互助没算过帐的地方，实行这办法后，群众劲头很大，才认为互助不是给代耕，不是糊涂帐。对下种算帐，是按当时地活多少，灵活评议，决定工资，然后参加人共分工资。现仅据城关三号一天下种总结，计八千余亩未下种地，有五千五百亩已下种，这样估计，两天至多三天，可全部种完。下种后，决定普遍检查一下，是否还留有荒地，要坚决消灭。为消灭荒地，政府宣布：凡去年没种的荒地，谁种奖励三年不出负担，地权归种地人，税契比平常地减半。（鲁林）
