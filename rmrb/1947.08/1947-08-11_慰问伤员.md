　　Visiting the Wounded

　　I. "Let's donate a little more money to buy something for the soldiers to eat!"

　　For the past few days, the people of the Third District of Shou Zhang have been overjoyed to hear that the People's Liberation Army has won many victories in a row on the south bank of the Yellow River. Work in the villages has become even more intense. Large convoys, small convoys, and stretcher teams have all set off. People rushing to repair the dangerous sections of the river dike, with their spirit of resistance and fearlessness, braved enemy aircraft harassment to complete this greatest project to ensure victory in the war. District and village cadres who had not yet departed, along with women, continued to conduct review work in the villages. Despite being so busy, the people's enthusiasm for supporting the army increased even more when they saw our wounded soldiers arriving. Thus, the people of the villages in the three sub-districts enthusiastically launched a donation campaign to visit the wounded. Everyone said in unison:

　　"Now that we poor people have been liberated, we have everything. Let's donate a little more money to buy something for our wounded soldiers to eat!"

　　An old man who had sent his son to join the army squatted on the street, smoking his pipe and smiling:

　　"That's right! If it weren't for these comrades who are risking their lives and shedding blood, we wouldn't have what we have today! When they come here, they're like our own family. Doesn't our family also have someone fighting against Old Chiang? We must visit them and tell them to take good care of themselves and not miss home!"

　　The district satisfied the people's requests and held a meeting with village cadres to discuss how to carry out the visitation work. In order to do this work even better, it was decided that the three sub-districts would conduct the visits in two batches. In just two days, the twelve villages in the two eastern sub-districts alone donated more than 2.4 million yuan. The women in the villages were busy: some went to the market, some sewed comfort bags, and some cut paper flowers and characters to paste on the comfort bags. Some organized laundry teams to wash bloody clothes for the soldiers. The children's corps also organized a visiting team. The people even took out their own mosquito nets for the seriously wounded soldiers to hang. The things that were bought back included ten large pigs, several large carts loaded with watermelons, several shoulder-pole loads of honeydew melons, and loads of eggs, vermicelli, and bean curd sheets. There were also baskets and baskets of towels, cigarettes, pastries, rock candy, peaches, and white sugar...

　　The villages seemed to be celebrating the New Year, or holding a happy event and sending gifts.

　　Liu Mingjiu, the director of the sub-district farmers' association, said to a comrade, feeling apologetic:

　　"Think about it, comrades, our People's Liberation Army is protecting Chairman Mao and protecting our fruits of liberation. They are bravely wounded. What does spending this little money count for!"

　　II. "Just write a sentence for me: 'The People's Liberation Army is good'..."

　　It was dark. Each village was holding a mass meeting. District cadres were also dispersed to participate. The cadres of Zhukou Village were soliciting the opinions of the masses on how to visit the wounded soldiers tomorrow. Some people suggested writing a letter of sympathy to the wounded.

　　"Yes, yes! That's a good idea!" Everyone agreed.

　　Some people wrote themselves. However, some people couldn't write, and they were also afraid of not writing well.

　　A district cadre sitting next to Zhang Jianyi, the secretary of the district party committee, said:

　　"Tell me what you want to say, and I'll write it for you."

　　As soon as he said this, the masses in the square moved. With a roar, everyone surrounded the small square table in front of the chairman. There was a moon in the sky. A small oil lamp was placed on the table. The hum of voices, in piles here and groups there, was all over the place. The light of cigarettes flickered among the people, and the weather was hot and humid. Old women were waving palm-leaf fans, swatting mosquitoes for their grandsons and granddaughters beside them. Young women, pulling each other and tugging at each other, shouted to tell the district cadre their sincere words.

　　"Tell me what you want to say, and I'll write it down for you." The district cadre took out a fountain pen from his pocket and said:

　　Everyone scrambled and said:

　　"Write mine first!"

　　"Write mine..."

　　"Take it slow, write one by one. We won't leave anyone out. Tell me, what is in your heart, just say it." Comrade Zhang Jianyi asked everyone to sit down.

　　Old Granny Ma Chunrong stood up and said:

　　"Comrade, I have a lot of things in my heart, but I can't say them. Just write a sentence for me: 'The People's Liberation Army is good'..."

　　Suddenly, an old man in his sixties jumped out of the crowd. He was wearing a blue homespun jacket, his face was full of wrinkles, his eyes were wide open, and he was shaking as he raised his clenched fists:

　　"Comrade, write down a few sincere words for me. My name is Geng Chuanmeng, and I'm from Xuzhou, Jiangsu. I've been here for twenty-seven years. In the past, I had nothing, nothing at all. I had to beg for food, catch chickens, and be scolded and beaten. This time, the People's Liberation Army has earned us houses and land, and they have won the world for us poor people. I will never forget them..."

　　"Tell those wounded comrades!" Old Granny Yan Xiumei, who was over sixty years old, could hardly speak. She seemed to be remembering some painful things, and the corners of her mouth were trembling. But she also seemed to see the things that made her happiest, and her eyes revealed a smiling light. "The Communist Party saved me. I begged for food for thirty-three years, with no place to live, here today and there tomorrow. I lived in a temple for seven years. Now I have houses, land, cattle, everything. When I see the things that have been distributed, I think of our People's Liberation Army!"

　　Bai Yueqing, the young director of the women's association, said:

　　"I only have these few words: In the past, I was oppressed by the landlords. They could scold me whenever they wanted, and beat me whenever they wanted, and I couldn't even lift my head. Now, we are liberated, and this is all thanks to the blood and sweat of the soldiers of the People's Liberation Army! They are wounded now and have come to our homes. People's hearts are made of flesh, who doesn't feel the pain! I can't repay their kindness, I can only sew and mend for them, wash and starch for them. They mustn't stand on ceremony with me."

　　The masses spoke even more enthusiastically. Some people couldn't squeeze to the front and didn't get their turn, so they were very anxious. They said to the people next to them, "Please take a few words from me and write them down together."

　　"Hmm, how can that be done! Who knows what's in your heart!"

　　III. "We still have to return to the front!"

　　After breakfast on July 26, the comfort bags and goods from each village were all gathered in the square in front of the district office. The sky was sometimes cloudy and sometimes sunny. It rained with a crash for a while, and then the hot sun shone on people's heads again. Watermelons and cantaloupes were piled all over the ground, like a melon market. Things that were afraid of getting wet were moved indoors.

　　Whenever the rain stopped, the drum and wind band composed of folk artists from the two villages would start playing outside again. The children's corps surrounded them, and the lightly wounded soldiers also came to watch the fun. District Chief Du Huashan led the district cadres, village cadres, and women in busily distributing goods and packing comfort bags. The treetops in the yard were still, and the house was as hot as a steamer. Everyone was covered in sweat, as if they had been drenched with water, and their clothes were sticking to their bodies.

　　In the afternoon, the visiting team set off. The drums and wind instruments played. The children's corps marched in formation, singing songs. The women walked in groups, each carrying a small and exquisite comfort bag in their hands. Carts loaded with goods rumbled along in front. People carrying shoulder poles and baskets followed behind. Representatives of the village cadres also walked along in separate groups. The women went to visit the seriously wounded soldiers. Some women went with their men to visit the lightly wounded soldiers. When our seriously wounded soldiers heard that the village was coming to visit them, some of them, even though their wounds were very serious, wanted to get up and personally welcome them. Some comrades were too weak to sit up, so they struggled to turn sideways and lean against the wall, looking out the window at the approaching crowd. The women put the comfort bags one by one on the soldiers' beds. They lit the cigarettes they had brought, one by one, and gently handed them to the soldiers. They also opened the rock candy packages and gave them pieces. The soldiers were so moved that they couldn't lie still or sit still any longer.

　　"Old grannies, elder sisters, we are happy even if you don't bring anything! You're going to all this trouble in this hot weather!" They scrambled to say.

　　Old Granny Jiang Xiuying went to the side of a wounded soldier, looked carefully at his wound, and tears flowed from her eyes unconsciously. She said, "Alas, comrade, we don't have good things to bring you to eat. Seeing you shedding blood and being wounded for us common people... You have created happiness for us, and we don't have to worry about food and clothing. We can't repay your kindness even if we take out our hearts! You are no different from our own children..."

　　Some soldiers replied excitedly, "Granny, don't be sad, our wounds will heal soon. You are like my own mother, and I feel very happy to see you. We have no way to repay your kindness, we only hope that our wounds will heal so that we can return to the front! We will win more battles and defeat Old Chiang, so that our common people can be completely liberated!"

　　Liu Fengying, the leader of the women's association group, also went to another room and began to cry.

　　"Comrades... take good care of your wounds. I will never forget how I was liberated. When you get well, come to my house and have a look. We have everything now, the wheat straw stacks are high, and the livestock have mills to use. We will continue to work hard in the rear to review, and resolutely eliminate the landlord class..."

　　The drums and wind instruments played. After listening to the speech by the representatives of the village cadres, the lightly wounded soldiers lined up and shouted slogans in a loud voice:

　　"Protect the common people! The common people are our own parents!"

　　"When our wounds heal, we will return to the front! We will not go home until Chiang Kai-shek is defeated!"

　　Visiting the wounded is like visiting relatives,
　　Thousands of words are not enough to express.

　　慰问伤员
    黑丁
    一、“多捐几个钱吧，给战士们买点啥吃！”
    寿张三区群众，几天来听到人民解放军，在黄河南岸接二连三的打了好些胜仗，大家欢喜得嘴都阖不上了。村上的工作更紧张起来。大车队，小车队，担架队，都出发了。赶修险工的人们，带着抗拒的呼声，无畏的精神，在敌机的骚扰下，走上河堤，争抢着去完成保证战争胜利的一件最伟大的工程。没有出发的区干部，村干部，和妇女们在村子里继续进行复查工作。虽然这样忙，可是群众一看到咱们的伤员来了，大家拥军的热情就更加提高了。于是三个小区各村的群众，热烈的展开了慰问伤员募捐运动。大家异口同声说：
    “如今咱们穷人都翻了身，啥也有啦。多捐几个钱吧，给咱们受伤的战士买点啥吃！”
    一个送走了儿子参军的老大爷，他蹲在街上，一边抽烟，一边笑眯眯的说：
    “可是对！要不是这些拚命流血的同志，咱会有今天！人家来到咱这，就跟咱亲人一样。咱家不是也有人去打老蒋吗？可要去慰问一下，叫他们好好养伤，不要想家！”
    区上满足了群众的要求，跟村干部开会商讨慰问工作的进行办法。为了要把这工作做得更好，便决定三个小区分两次慰问。仅仅两天光景，只是东边的两个小区的十二个村子，就捐了二百四十多万元。村上的妇女忙开了：有的赶集，有的缝慰问袋，有的剪纸花、剪字，往慰问袋上贴。有的组织了洗衣队准备给战士们洗血衣。儿童团也组织了慰问队。群众把自己用的蚊帐都拿出来给重伤员挂。东西买回来了：十口大猪，西瓜拉了好几大车。甜瓜担了好几挑。鸡蛋、粉条、粉皮、一担又一担。毛巾、纸烟、点心、冰糖、桃子、白糖…………一筐子又一筐子。
    村子好象在过年；又象在办喜事，送喜礼。
    小区农会主任刘明九，他过意不去的样子，对一个同志说：
    “你想想同志，咱们人民解放军保卫毛主席，保卫咱们翻身果实，英勇负伤，咱们花这点钱又算得什么！”
    二、“你就给俺写一句话吧，人民解放军好……”
    天黑了。各村都在开群众大会。区干部也分散开去参加了。竹口村干部征求群众意见明天怎么样去慰问伤员。有的人提出来要给伤员写封慰问信。
    “对，对！这个办法可好！”大家赞成了。
    有的人自己写。但是，有的人不会写，也怕写不好。
    坐在区委书记张建宜旁边的一个区干部说：
    “你们说吧，我替你们写。”
    这一来，广场上的群众动起来了。大家轰的一声，把主席前边一张小方桌围严了。天上有月亮。桌子上放着一盏小油灯。人声嗡嗡，东一堆，西一伙，都在那儿乱嚷。吸烟的火光在人们中间闪动，天气闷热。老大娘们摇晃着蒲扇，在给身旁的孙子孙女打蚊子。青年妇女，你拉我一把，我扯你一下，互相嚷着叫把自己的真心话告诉区干部。
    “你们说吧，我来给你们记。”区干部从口袋里掏出水笔来说：
    大家你争我抢。说道：
    “先给俺记吧！”
    “给俺记吧………”
    “慢慢来，一个一个写。都拉不下。说吧，谁心里想什么，就说什么。”张建宜同志叫大家坐下。
    马春荣老大娘，站起来说：
    “同志，俺心里一大堆话，就是说不出来。你就给俺写一句话吧，人民解放军好………”
    忽然，一个六十多岁的老大爷从人空里跳出来了。他穿了一件蓝粗布褂，满脸皱纹，瞪大了两眼，举着两只攒起的拳头，颤抖的说：
    “同志，给俺写上几句真心话吧，俺叫耿传孟，是江苏徐州人，来这二十七年啦。过去，俺两手空空，啥也没有，要饭，抓鸡，受骂挨打，这回人民解放军给俺挣下了房产地土，给咱们穷人打下了天下。俺啥时候也忘不了他们……”
    “告诉俺那些受伤的同志吧！”六十多岁的阎秀梅老大娘，她几乎说不出话来。她好象想起了一些痛心的事，嘴角老在发抖。她又仿佛看见了使她最高兴的事，两眼却流露出微笑的光芒。“共产党救了俺，俺要了三十三年饭，没房子住，今天这，明天那，在庙上住了七年。现在俺房子、地、牛，啥都有了。俺看见了分的东西，就想起了咱们的人民解放军来！”
    年纪轻轻的妇女会主任白月清说：
    “俺只有这几句话：过去俺受地主压迫，人家说骂就骂，说打就打，俺也不能抬头。如今，咱们解放啦，这都是人民解放军的战士流血流汗为咱们挣下的功劳！他们现在受了伤，到了自己家。人心是肉长的，谁不痛！俺报不了恩情，只能给他们缝缝补补，洗洗浆浆，叫他们可不要客气。”
    群众讲话更热烈了。有的人挤不上去，轮不到自己，就急得很。便对旁边的人说：“你给俺捎带上几句话吧，一块写上。”
    “嗯，那怎么行！谁知道你心里想些啥！”
    三、“我们还要回前方！”
    七月二十六日早饭后，各村子的慰问袋，东西都集中到区部门前的广场上。忽阴忽晴的天，一会儿哗啦一声下起雨来，一会儿火热的太阳又晒到人们头顶上。西瓜、甜瓜、摆满了一地，象瓜市一般。怕淋雨的东西都搬到屋里去了。
    每当雨一停，两个村子的民间艺人组成的鼓乐队，就又在外头打起来吹了。儿童团围着，轻伤员也走来看热闹。区长杜华山带着区干部，村干部，妇女在忙着分东西，装慰问袋。院子里的树梢动也不动，屋子热得象蒸笼。大家满身大汗，好似用水浇过一般，衣服都贴到身上了。
    下午，慰问队出发了。鼓乐吹着，打着。儿童团排着队，唱着歌。妇女一组一组的，每人手里掂着一个小巧玲珑的慰问袋。大车拉着东西轱辘轱辘的在前边走。后边有人挑着担挎着篮。各村干部代表，也分开小组跟着走了。妇女去慰问重伤员。有的妇女跟男人去慰问轻伤员。咱们的重伤员，一听说村上来慰问了，有的伤口虽然很重，但谁都想爬起来亲自招待一番。有的同志实在坐不起来，一边从窗户往外望着走来的人群，一边在挣扎着侧起身子来依靠着墙。妇女们把慰问袋一个一个放到战士们床上。她们把拿出来的纸烟，一根一根点着，轻轻的递到战士们手里。又把冰糖包打开，一块一块送给他们。战士们被感动得再也躺不稳，坐不住了。
    “老大娘，嫂子们，你们不拿东西，我们也高兴！大热天，叫你们费这番心！”他们抢着说。
    姜秀英老大娘，她靠到伤员身边，仔细看了看伤，不自觉的眼睛流下泪来。她说：“唉，同志，咱们没有好东西带给你们吃。看看你们为咱们老百姓流血受伤………你们给俺造下幸福，吃穿不愁，俺把心掏出来也报答不完恩情！你们和俺亲孩子有啥两样……”
    有的战士激动的回答：“大娘，你不要难过吧，我们的伤快好了。你象我亲娘一样，来看看，我心里很痛快。我们没法补情，只希望伤好了，我们还要回前方！我们多打几个胜仗，把老蒋打垮，咱们老百姓好彻底翻身！”
    妇会小组长刘凤英，她到另一个屋里去也哭起来了。
    “同志……你们好好养伤吧。俺忘不了是怎么翻的身。等你们好了到俺家去看看吧，现在啥也不缺啦，麦秸垛高高的，牲口磨也有用的啦。俺在后方还要努力复查，坚决消灭掉地主阶级………”
    鼓乐吹着，打着。轻伤员排着队听完了村干部代表讲过话之后，就高声的喊起口号来了：
    “保护老百姓！老百姓是我们的亲爹娘！”
    “伤好回前方，不打垮蒋介石不回家！”
    “…………”（附图片）
    慰问伤员如亲人，
    千言万语说不清。
