　　Military Supply Clothing Factory No. 4

  　Production Soars
    [Report from this newspaper] Under the slogans of "Everyone Achieve Merit" and "Learn from Factory No. 1," the morale of the workers and staff of the Fourth Clothing Factory of the Military Region Supply Department is rising daily. The ten members of the dyeing team have each set merit plans, guaranteeing no delay in cutting work; the output has increased from 13,000 square feet per day to 21,000 square feet per day. Zhu Zhikuan, an 18-year-old youth, refused to rest despite being ill; Feng Wanshan carried 200 loads of water a day and also helped with washing pots and pans and cooking; Comrade Shi Ying, the 50-year-old leader of the dyeing team, worked from dawn till dusk with everyone else, and when the water carrier fell ill, he automatically took his place. Liu Yuelu, a cutting worker, increased his output of cotton coat faces from 80 pieces per day to 180 pieces, averaging 135.7 pieces per month; Song Qiucheng increased from 120 pieces to 175 pieces, averaging 125 pieces per month. Machine worker Li Yugen completed 20 cotton coat linings (old wrappings) in half a day; Wang Qijun and Shen Manxi both increased from 20 pieces per day to 30 pieces; while Comrade Wang Fujin averaged 42 pieces per day. Apprentice Li Haiquan buttoned cotton coats, completing 30 sets in half a day, and made 270 cotton coat edges per day; apprentice Shen Zhong and apprentice Shang Xiuzi produced 30 pieces on the first day, 34 pieces on the second day, and increased to 46 pieces after ten days, breaking the saying that "a One-Five machine cannot produce 40 sleeves." Shen Chunxi, the vice chairman of the trade union, competed with his younger brother Mi Xi, and the two produced 100 sleeves a day; Comrade Wang Fujin even created a record of 70 pieces per day. Because there were too few cutting workers, factory director Zheng Fuyu, inspector Song Enlei, and storekeeper Ma Baoshan all personally participated in cutting clothes, and other cadres replaced their work. Factory No. 4 is now brewing a major August competition to celebrate the victory of the southward army.

　　军供被服四厂
  　生产突飞猛进
    【本报讯】军区供给部被服第四厂，在“人人立功”、“向一厂看齐”的口号下，职工情绪日趋高涨，染工组十人，个个订了立功计划，保证不误裁工；产量由日产一万三千方尺，增至二万一千方尺，十八岁的青年朱志宽，有病拒绝休息；冯万山一天担水二百担，还帮助洗锅做饭；五十岁的染工组长石英同志，起早搭黑，和大家一块干，担水的病了，他自动代替担水。裁工刘月路裁棉衣面子，由日裁八十件，增到一百八十件，一月平均为一百三十五点七件；宋秋成由一百二十件，增到一百七十五件，一月平均一百二十五件。机工李玉根，打棉衣皮子（旧裹子），半天完成二十件；王起俊、沈满喜均由日打二十件，增至三十件；而王福金同志则平均日产四十二件。学徒李海泉扣棉衣，半天完成三十套，打棉衣边日产二百七十件；学徒申忠和学上袖子，第一天产三十件，第二天三十四件，十天之后增至四十六件，打破了“一五机子上不了四十件袖子”的说法。工会副主任沈春喜与其弟米喜比赛，两人日上袖子一百件；王福金同志更创造出日上七十件的最高纪录。因裁工太少，厂长郑甫滏，检查员宋恩垒、保管员马保山，都亲身参加裁衣服，其他干部便代替他们的工作。现四厂正酝酿着八月份大竞赛，以庆祝南下大军的胜利。
