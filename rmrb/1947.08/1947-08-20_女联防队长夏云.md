　　The name of female militia captain Xia Yun resounds throughout the Funing area along the Tongyu Highway. The Chiang Kai-shek's "Returning Home Corps" looting grain in the villages, would be terrified at the sound of gunfire, fearing Xia Yun had arrived. They would hurriedly abandon the opened granaries and the looted grain, fleeing for their lives; while the common people would run out of their villages to welcome the approaching militia队. Leading the way was a woman, short and stocky, in her thirties, carrying a small Mauser, wearing a coarse cloth jacket, and a leather belt around her waist, who was none other than Xia Yun, beloved by the masses.

　　Her family were poor peasants. From the age of nine, she worked in factories and power plants in Shanghai. At nineteen, she returned to Funing and married a poor peasant. In 1940, when the Eighth Route Army arrived, because she had heard in the factories that "the Communist Party is for the poor," she resolutely joined the anti-Japanese work, and was later elected as the township Women's Resistance Director. In 1943, after becoming the township head, she took up the "Hubei rifle" and fought guerrilla warfare against the Japanese. Last winter, when the Chiang army invaded Beisha in Funing, she led more than a dozen militiamen in a life-and-death struggle against the Chiang and puppet troops in Xufeng Township, which was surrounded on three sides by strongholds. The "Returning Home Corps" shouted in the villages every day: "Catch Xia Yun, catch her alive!" However, their shouts were loud, but Xia Yun's gunfire was even louder. Once, dozens of members of the "Returning Home Corps" went to Zengzhuang to loot grain, causing chaos when Xia Yun's militia隊 rushed in. They fired a burst of gunfire on the northern坟头, and militia support teams from neighboring townships also arrived. Xia Yun immediately led the charge into the village. The "Returning Home Corps" abandoned more than a hundred loads and fled in panic, leaving behind the ground covered with soybeans, rice, and sorghum. Xia Yun called on everyone to help the people gather it up and take it home. The masses were overjoyed. Xia Yun often held meetings with the masses while fighting the enemy. Once, her militia隊 held the enemy at the edge of Xuzhuang Village, and she went into the village to hold a meeting. The enemy clearly heard Xia Yun's voice, but there was nothing they could do. In the past three months, Xia Yun's militia队 has fought more than twenty battles at the cost of zero casualties, making it impossible for the Chiang regime to establish itself in Xufeng Township, which is twenty miles around.

　　女联防队长夏云
    新辰
    女联防队长夏云的名字响遍通榆公路上阜宁一带，该地蒋记“返乡团”下乡抢粮，一听到枪声就怕是夏云来了。急忙丢下开了的粮窖和抢来的粮食，没命的逃跑；老百姓则跑出庄口欢迎远远奔来的联防队。打头一个扛着小马枪，穿粗布挂子，腰上束着皮带，短小粗壮，三十来岁的女人就是群众热爱的夏云。
    她家是贫农，九岁起就在上海工厂和电灯厂做工，十九岁回到阜宁和一个贫农结了婚。二十九年八路军打来，因为她在工厂里早听说过“共产党是为穷人的”，就毅然参加了抗日工作，后被选为乡妇抗主任，三十二年当乡长后就扛起“湖北条子”和鬼子打游击，去冬蒋军侵占阜宁北沙，她便率领十几个民兵在三面是据点的许冯乡与蒋伪军出生入死的搏斗了。“还乡团”天天下乡喊：“捉夏云啊，捉活的来呀！”但是，他们喊得响，夏云的枪却打得更响。一次，“还乡团”数十名到曾庄抢粮，正闹得鸡飞狗跳墙的时候，夏云联防队冲来了，在北坟头上打了一阵枪，邻乡民兵助战队也已赶到，夏云即带头冲进村子，“还乡团”丢下一百多付担子狼狈逃窜了，丢下满地的黄豆、谷子和高粱，夏云号召大家帮助老百姓收拾回家，群众都欢喜得合不拢嘴。夏云常常一面打敌人一面和群众开会，有一次她的联防队把敌人顶住在许庄村边上，她自己就去村里开会，敌人清清楚楚听到夏云的声音，但一点也没有办法。三个月来夏云的民兵联防队以无一伤亡的代价作战二十余次，使周围二十里的许冯乡蒋政权迄今无法建立。（新华社华中十八日电）
