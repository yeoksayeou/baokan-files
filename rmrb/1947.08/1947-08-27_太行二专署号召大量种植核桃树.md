　　Taihang Second Administrative Office Calls for Mass Planting of Walnut Trees
    [Reported by this newspaper] The Taihang Second Administrative Region has a high and dry climate, suitable for the growth of walnut trees. Walnuts have always been one of the main sources of economic income for the local people. In order to further increase economic income and solve the supply of oil and industrial raw materials for the people, the Administrative Office and the Agriculture and Forestry Bureau specially issued a call on the 12th of this month to all counties in the region to plant walnut trees on a large scale. As the White Dew solar term is approaching, the county and district governments and cooperatives should prepare early to regulate seeds and organize the masses to plant. According to the different conditions of each county, efforts should be made to complete the planting of 500,000 live walnut trees. In terms of technology, the Agriculture and Forestry Bureau will compile and distribute special technical pamphlets, and technical experts in planting walnut trees should be organized to provide guidance. Planting on various terraced fields, mountain edges, and land with thick and fertile soil is best. (Zhao Quanheng)
