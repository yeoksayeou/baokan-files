　　Chengwut County Cadres' Specific Division of Labor
  　War Support and Land Investigation Mutually Guaranteed
    [Our Newspaper, Ji-Lu-Yu, 13th dispatch] Chengwut County is advancing war support and land reform simultaneously, with new innovations and experiences in its work. Firstly, the leadership recognized that the characteristic of this war support is its long-term nature, but in each battle and the rapid movement of troops, the war support also carries a sense of urgency. It is both long-term and urgent, which is the characteristic of this war support work. Secondly, it was also clarified that without thorough re-examination and without mobilizing the masses, it would be impossible to support the front lines for a long time. Therefore, only by thoroughly mobilizing the masses can the completion of war support tasks be guaranteed. Later, the county party committee began to propose that the two major tasks should advance simultaneously, established two sets of organizations, specifically divided the leadership, and some districts coordinated and mutually guaranteed the two organizations in their execution, truly achieving simultaneous advancement. For example, the Third District is a typical example of this. When specific war support tasks arrive, all cadres help each other to complete them. Once stretchers and carts are dispatched, the headquarters leaves a small number of people to manage the war support, and all cadres turn to land investigation. When news of victory at the front arrives or war support receives praise, it encourages the emotions of cadres and the masses. The mass movement in the rear is enthusiastically launched, which in turn guarantees war support.

　　城武干部具体分工
  　战勤查田互相保证
    【本报冀鲁豫十三日电】城武县战勤土改齐头并进，在工作中有了新的创造和经验。首先在领导上认识了这次战勤的特点是较长期的，可是在每个战役的进行和部队的迅速运动中，战勤又带着一种突击性，既是长期、又是突击，这就是这次战勤工作的特点。其次又明确了复查不贯彻，群众不发动，长期支援前线是不可能的，所以只有彻底发动群众，才能保证战勤任务的完成。后来县委开始提出了两大工作齐头并进，建立了两套组织，具体分工领导，执行中有些区两种组织互相配合、互相保证，真正做到齐头并进。例如三区就是这一种典型，战勤的具体任务一来，全体干部互助完成，担架、大车一出门，指挥部留少数人掌握战勤，全体干部转入查田，前方胜利消息传来或战勤受到表扬，鼓励了干部群众的情绪，后方群众运动热烈展开，又保证了战勤。
