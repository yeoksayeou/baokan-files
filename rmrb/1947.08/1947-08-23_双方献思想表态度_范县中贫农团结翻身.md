Fanxian County, August 21st (This Newspaper's Dispatch from the Hebei-Shandong-Henan Border Region) -- In Fanxian County's First District, the poor peasants are the mainstay, and a genuine unity between middle and poor peasants has been achieved. In mid-July, the First District convened a meeting of poor peasant activists, where everyone contributed their thoughts. For example, they discussed the protection of landlords, embezzlement during the distribution of spoils, and other issues, which enhanced their class consciousness and strengthened the unity of the poor peasants. After the meeting, the activists returned to their villages and convened separate meetings of poor and middle peasants to offer their thoughts. Later, in villages like Yuhuangmiao, the poor peasants expressed their attitude: they would resolutely not struggle against the middle peasants. At the same time, the middle peasants also offered their thoughts, saying, "In the past, we were afraid of struggle and had no heart to overthrow our oppressors," and "We didn't dare to take out the things we hid for the landlords in the past, for fear of being struggled against." After the poor and middle peasants offered their thoughts and expressed their attitudes, a joint meeting of poor and middle peasants was held. In Qianfengjie Village, the poor peasants took the lead in welcoming the middle peasants to join their ranks, and shouted, "Resolutely do not struggle against the middle peasants! Middle and poor peasants are one family!" The middle peasant representatives said, "From now on, we will resolutely not follow the landlord's line!" During the expression of attitudes, two families confessed to hiding things for the landlords. After offering their thoughts and self-reporting, the middle and poor peasants became more united and launched a united struggle against the landlords. They also gained the following experiences: (1) Middle and poor peasants must offer their thoughts to eliminate the estrangement between the two sides with a spirit of self-criticism; and the poor peasants must take the initiative to unite with the middle peasants, dispel the middle peasants' concerns, and enlighten the middle peasants' consciousness. This is because for a long time in the past, the middle peasant policy was not grasped by the masses, and in some places, the middle peasants were mistakenly struggled against. Today, when "poor peasant backbone" is mentioned, it is bound to cause uneasiness among the middle peasants, so the poor peasants must first express their attitude in order to truly dispel the middle peasants' concerns. (2) To unleash the enthusiasm of the middle peasants, there must be a strong poor peasant backbone to lead the way during the in-depth land reform review period, because before the poor peasants form a backbone force, the middle peasants do not have the courage to retaliate against the landlord class for their hatred. For example, one middle peasant in Makou Village said when offering his thoughts, "I hid things for the landlord; if I offer them up, I'm afraid of the landlord, but if I don't offer them up, I'm afraid of the poor peasants. Now I'm no longer afraid of the landlord. I'll offer up those two bags of grain that belong to the landlord." (3) The harder the landlords are hit, the more the middle peasants will be alienated from the landlord class and the closer they will be to the poor peasants. When striking at the landlords, it is necessary to constantly enlighten the middle peasants to offer their thoughts and raise their class consciousness. For example, after the middle peasants offered their thoughts about feeling pity for the landlords at this meeting, they were able to take active action. (4) After the problem is solved ideologically through the offering of thoughts, the distribution of spoils can truly achieve the goal of filling the poor and helping the needy, proving that in the past, simply using the distribution of spoils to mobilize the middle peasants could not achieve the desired effect, because the middle peasants' highest demand is to relieve economic and political oppression. If their demands can be met, they will naturally be moved. (5) The great unity of the poor and middle peasants is mainly based on the poor peasant backbone leading the way to unite the middle peasants; otherwise, it is difficult to achieve unity.

　　双方献思想表态度
  　范县中贫农团结翻身
    【本报冀鲁豫二十一日电】范县一区以贫农为主，达到中贫农真正团结。七月中旬，一区召开贫农积极分子会，在会议上，都献出思想。如对地主的包庇，分果实中的贪污等，阶级觉悟提高，贫农更加团结。会议结束，积极分子回村，分别召开贫农会与中农会，进行献思想。后玉皇庙等村贫农表明了态度，坚决不斗中农。同时中农献思想时也说：“过去怕斗争，没心闹翻身”，“从前给地主藏的东西不敢拿出来，怕拿出来被斗。”经过贫中农献思想表明态度，进行贫中农大会合。在前冯揭村贫农掌欢迎中农到自己的行列站队，并高呼：“坚决不斗中农！中贫农是一家！”中农代表说：“以后坚决不走地主路线！”在表明态度中，有两家自藏了地主的东西。经过献思想与自报，中贫农更加团结，一致向地主展开斗争；并取得以下经验：（一）中贫农必须献出自己的思想，以自我批评的精神消除双方的隔阂；并且必须贫农主动的团结中农，解除中农的顾虑，启发中农的自觉，因为过去很长时间中农政策没有被群众掌握，有些地方误斗了中农。在今天提出“贫农骨干”时，必然引起中农的不安，所以必须贫农首先表明态度，才能真正解除中农的顾虑。（二）中农的积极性发挥，在土改复查深入时期，必须有强有力的贫农骨干带头，因为贫农未形成骨干力量之前，中农对地主阶级的仇恨便没有勇气报复。如马口村有一个中农献思想时说：“我藏了地主的东西，献了怕地主，不献又怕贫农；现在我可再不怕地主了，我把地主那两布袋粮食献出来。”（三）对地主打的越狠，中农和地主阶级越会疏远，和贫农会更靠近。在打击地主时，要不断启发中农献思想，提高其阶级觉悟。例如这次会议上中农献出对地主可怜的思想以后，还能积极行动起来。（四）经过献思想，从思想上解决了问题后，分果实时可以真正做到填贫补穷，证明过去有些地方单纯以分果实来发动中农不能达到应有的效果，因为中农最高的要求是解除经济上的政治上的压迫，能满足他的要求，他就会自然的动起来。（五）贫中农大团结，主要是以贫农骨干作领导来团结中农，不然很难团结。
