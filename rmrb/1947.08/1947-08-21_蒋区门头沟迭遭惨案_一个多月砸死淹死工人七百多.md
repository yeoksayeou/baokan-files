　　Chiang Kai-shek Area Mentougou Suffers Repeated Tragedies
  　Over 700 Workers Crushed and Drowned in Just Over a Month
Xinhua News Agency, Jin-Cha-Ji, 18th: The famous Mentougou coal mine in Pingxi, under the rule of the Chiang bandit, has suffered continuous tragedies. In an attempt to solve the coal shortage, the Chiang government, disregarding the safety of workers' lives, indiscriminately excavates, and many kilns have been dug through. In May, the Zhongying and Zhongxing mines successively crushed up to 200 workers to death. On July 9th, at a depth of 900 feet in the Zhongxing kiln, "tiger water" that had been deposited for many years was dug out. For a time, the water was so fierce that even iron coal carts weighing over a thousand pounds rolled away with the water. After the flood rushed out, eight neighboring kilns were submerged one after another, and more than 300 workers were tragically drowned. According to statistics from the Sixth Precinct of the Mentougou Police Station, from May to early July, more than 760 workers in the town have been crushed and drowned to death.

　　蒋区门头沟迭遭惨案
  　一个多月砸死淹死工人七百多
    【新华社晋察冀十八日电】蒋贼统治下的平西门头沟著名煤矿，连续发生惨案。蒋政府为企图解决煤荒，不顾工人生命安全，滥行挖掘，很多窑都被挖通，五月份中英、中兴两矿曾连续砸死工人达二百名。七月九日中兴窑九百尺深处又被掘出多年沉积的“老虎水”，一时水势凶猛，连千余斤重的推煤铁车，也顺水滚去。大水冲出后，邻窑八座被相继淹没，工人三百余名惨遭溺死。据门头沟警察六分所统计：自五月至七月初一个多月中，全镇工人砸死淹死者已达七百六十多人。
