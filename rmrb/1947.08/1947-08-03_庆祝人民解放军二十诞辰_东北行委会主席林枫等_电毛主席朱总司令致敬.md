Comrades of the New China News Agency forwarding from Northern Shaanxi to Chairman Mao, Commander-in-Chief Zhu, Northeast Commander-in-Chief Lin, and all commanders and fighters of the Northeast Democratic Allied Army of the Chinese People's Liberation Army:

    On the occasion of the twentieth anniversary of the birth of the Chinese People's Liberation Army, under your wise leadership, the national patriotic self-defense war launched in various parts of the country has been reporting victories from all battlefields, and the national revolutionary situation is developing day by day. Thanks to the Democratic Allied Army's thunderous and swift summer offensive, the balance of power between the enemy and ourselves in the Northeast war situation has undergone a fundamental change. The broad masses of the people are celebrating this great victory with unparalleled excitement and joy. On behalf of the 40 million compatriots in the Northeast and governments at all levels, we extend our highest respect and deepest gratitude to you – the leaders of the Chinese people, the creators, organizers, and leaders of the Chinese People's Liberation Army. We firmly believe that the invading Chiang troops will find their own graves on every battlefield, and the reactionaries headed by Chiang Kai-shek will be judged by the people of the whole country. We are also deeply aware that the Chiang Kai-shek bandit gang will continue to intensify its efforts to sell out the motherland in exchange for further assistance from American imperialism, making a last-ditch struggle. Therefore, we are determined to abide by Chairman Mao's wise instruction of "no arrogance in victory," and work even harder to adhere to our posts and intensify our work. The Chinese people, having defeated Japanese imperialism and its puppet Wang Jingwei and Pu Yi, will certainly be able to defeat American imperialism and its "puppet emperor" Chiang Kai-shek. Our current administrative meeting is being held to strengthen the work of the government, further mobilize the masses, thoroughly implement land reform, build a solid rear area, and mobilize all manpower and material resources to support the front, in order to finally defeat the "Second Manchuria" and cooperate with and support all battlefields across the country to completely, thoroughly, and entirely eliminate all invading troops of Chiang Kai-shek.

    庆祝人民解放军二十诞辰
    东北行委会主席林枫等
    电毛主席朱总司令致敬
    【新华社东北一日电】东北行政委员会林枫、张学思、高崇民正副主席“八一”致电毛主席、朱总司令及林彪总司令等致敬。原电如下：
    新华社转陕北毛主席、朱总司令、东北林总司令并转中国人民解放军东北民主联军全体指战员同志：
    当此中国人民解放军诞生二十周年的节日，全国各地展开的爱国自卫战争在你们的英明领导之下，各个战场捷报频传，全国革命形势正在日益发展，我东北战局由于民主联军以雷霆万钧之势，猛烈展开夏季攻势的结果，敌我力量对比已发生根本的变化。广大人民正以无比兴奋愉快的心情来庆祝这一伟大的胜利。我们谨代表东北四千万同胞，及各级政府向你们——中国人民领袖，中国人民解放军的创造者、组织者与领导者致以崇高的敬意与深厚的谢忱。我们深信进犯蒋军在各个战场同样找到他们自己的坟墓，以蒋介石为首的反动派必将在全国人民面前，得到审判。我们亦深知蒋介石匪帮会继续变本加厉以出卖祖国的代价，换取美帝国主义进一步的援助，而作垂死的挣扎，因此我们决遵守毛主席“胜利不骄”的明训，更以百倍努力谨守岗位，加紧工作。中国人民既然能够战胜日本帝国主义及其卵翼下的傀儡汪精卫和傅仪，也就一定能够战胜美国帝国主义及其卵翼下的“儿皇帝”蒋介石。我们目前召开的行政会议就是为了加强政权工作，进一步的放手发动群众，贯澈土地改革，建设巩固的后方，动员一切人力物力支援前线，以便最后打垮“二满洲”，并配合与支援全国各战场彻底干脆全部消灭蒋介石的一切进犯军。
