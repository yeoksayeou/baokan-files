Blackboard Newspapers and Radio Stations
　　Second Letter from the Countryside
    Chang Jianghe

    ...The mass blackboard in Beiliu Village, Licheng, Taihang, has developed into a mass-run newspaper. The whole village is organized with an editorial committee (composed of three primary school teachers) and a review committee (composed of the village head, political director, and public security officer), with production teams competing against each other. Everyone gathers around to contribute ideas about the innovations and achievements accumulated in each area, piecing together drafts, which are then organized by the editorial committee and reviewed by the review committee before being published on the mass blackboard, with the authors' names written on them. Better drafts are sent to the county's small newspaper and the Xinhua Daily. This not only summarizes experiences and commends models, but also is well-received and cared about by the masses, because it is the masses' own creation, the actual things happening in the village. For example, after the draft of a woman named Li X (originally illiterate) was published, she personally went to look at it carefully.

    At the same time, they combine the blackboard newspaper with the radio station. All published drafts are broadcast once through the radio, so that illiterate people can also know what is happening in the world without leaving their homes. What is particularly worth mentioning is that they pay attention to the cultivation of rural Li Youcai—talented clapper talkers. For example, six young people, including militia members Zhang Yuxing, Zhang Yin, and woman Zhang Shuangying, were originally illiterate, but in the mass movement, they compose as they fight, compose as they sing, and sometimes even add music. These clapper talks, because they are closely linked to the central work, are very simple and vivid, and the masses love to listen to them. They have actually become propaganda and mobilization experts loved by the masses, basic correspondents for the mass blackboard, and at the same time, learning models for cultural emancipation and advanced thinkers.

    But according to my understanding, many mass blackboards in our Taihang area are either completely monopolized by teachers or are neglected after being set up. What should be praised is not praised, and what should be criticized is not criticized. The materials published are not updated for one or two months, or they simply transcribe international and domestic news from the newspaper; as a result, the blackboard newspaper cannot take root among the masses and becomes detached from the masses' real struggles, becoming a formalistic thing. The radio station is used arbitrarily; in some villages, various examples or news of village work are not broadcast, but instead, they keep shouting from morning to night: "XXX, come here quickly! XXX, come here quickly!" The shouting makes people feel annoyed and restless, losing the prudence in using the radio station and failing to play its due role.

    Therefore, based on the above situation, I believe that in order to meet the requirements of cultural life after emancipation and to make cultural work more effectively serve the central work, it is very important and urgent to rectify the village's mass cultural education. Beiliu Village has provided some experience in this regard, which is worth our reference:....

　　黑板报与广播台
  　农村来信之二
    常江河
    ……太行黎城北流村的大众黑板，已形成了群众办报。全村组织有编委会（由小教员三人组成），审判会（村长、政治主任、公安员组成），以生产小组为单位展开竞赛。各处积累有的创造和成绩，大家便围在一起，你一句我一句地凑成稿子，由编委会整理，审委会审查，然后刊登在大众黑板上，并写上作者的名字。更好的稿子，就寄送给县小报，新华日报。这样既总结了经验，表扬了模范，群众也很爱看，很关心，因为是群众自己的创作，是本村的实际事情。如妇女李×虫（原不识字）的稿子登出后，她还亲自去仔细看一番。
    同时他们把黑板报和广播台结合起来。凡登出的稿子，都要由广播筒广播一次，使不识字的人也能不出户而知天下事。特别值得提出的：是他们注意了农村李有才——天才板人的培养，如民兵张玉兴、张寅、妇女张双英等六个青年，他们原来都不识字，但在群运中斗一个编一个，编一个唱一个，有时甚至还配着音乐。这些快板，因为紧紧结合了中心工作，所以都很朴实生动，群众很爱听。他们实际上已变成了群众热爱的宣传鼓动家，大众黑板的基本通讯员，同时是文化翻身的学习模范，和思想觉悟的先进者。
    但据我了解，我们太行区有不少大众黑板，不是由教员一手包办，便是包而不办。该表扬的没表扬，该批评的也没批评，登出的材料一月两月不换，或单纯地转抄报上的国际国内大消息；以致黑板报不能在群众中生根，与群众的现实斗争脱节，成为形式主义的东西，对广播台则随便乱用，有的村，不广播村里工作的各种范例或消息，从早到晚一直吼着：“×××你快来，×××你快来！”吼的人心烦耳噪，既失去运用广播台的慎重性，也起不了应有的作用。
    所以根据上述情况，我认为为了适应翻身后文化生活的要求，使文化工作更有效地为中心工作服务，整顿村的大众文化教育是非常重要而迫切的，这方面北流村已提供出一些经验，值得我们参考：……。
