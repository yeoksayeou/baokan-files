Xinhua News Agency, Jilu豫 Frontline, 2nd - Our reporter interviewed the newly captured Chiang army Lieutenant General and Deputy Commander of the 55th Division, Li Mingya, and the Commander and Deputy Commander of the 70th Division, Chen Yiding and Luo Zhedong. From their conversations, we discovered a significant change. In the past, captured Chiang army senior officers always attributed their failures to accidental military errors, and under the pretext of soldiers not being concerned with politics, refused to understand the fundamental political reasons. But now it is different. Li Mingya said: "We are now completely demoralized, not only the lower-ranking officers and soldiers, but most seriously, us generals. Those defending the city have long lost confidence, and those reinforcing it drag on for as long as possible. Li had just returned from training in Nanjing. He said: recently Chiang Kai-shek organized training for officers above the rank of colonel, attempting to solve two problems, in addition to reviewing tactics, the main one is the issue of morale." Li said: "What can be done? The General Headquarters absolutely does not admit any strategic errors, but instead blames the generals for not paying attention to tactics, and not caring about their own lives and honor, resulting in a large number of generals being captured. Regarding morale, Chiang only put forward the four words 'shared glory and shared disgrace'. Chiang said: I am old, it doesn't matter, if you don't do a good job, in the end, if you fail, you will all be objects of the Communist revolution. How can this solve any problems?" Li also said: "Now everyone wants to work in the Ministry of National Defense, it has almost become a trend. Everyone says that our group is no good, let's promote young cadres! Some are full of resentment, even fearing that they won't collapse, it would be better if they collapsed, then you and I would all be the same." After laughing for a while, he said: "This time I spent more than forty days in training. In fact, one month is more than enough, but most people hide and avoid it, not returning to the team for two or three months, so our Commander Cao Fulin said to me: 'Mingya, you are still honest'." He now believes that the reason for low morale is: "The politics over there are too corrupt, completely divorced from the masses. Following the army are eight big characters: corrupt officials, evil gentry and local bullies. The front is busy shedding blood and sweat, the back is busy scraping the land, how can there be morale?" The two commanders of the 70th Division seem to have a deeper understanding of this issue. Luo Zhedong, with a thoughtful expression on his face, said bluntly: "The problem on our side is that there is no political capital. Look at the Northern Expedition, we had a distant vision for tomorrow. Today we fight the warlords, tomorrow the revolution will succeed, with only a short dawn in between. The War of Resistance was also like this. But now, what are we fighting for today, what will tomorrow be like? The future is completely dark, where is the courage to shed blood and sacrifice, how can we not be defeated?" Chen Yiding said: "We now don't dare to talk to the troops, what issues can we talk about?" Chen was a graduate of the third class of Whampoa Military Academy, and Luo was from the fourth class. They had recently received training in Nanjing. They repeatedly mentioned the Northern Expedition, repeatedly talking about the vigor of the people at that time and the high morale of the Northern Expeditionary Army, and that kind of close military-civilian relationship. Luo said: "Now you have become the Northern Expeditionary Army of that time, and we have become the Northern Warlords of that time." Finally, Luo said: "It is absolutely impossible for us to defeat you, now we only hope that your victory will come sooner."

    蒋家中将说真话
    没有政治资本连话也不敢同部队讲
    自己成了北洋军阀打胜仗绝无可能
    【新华社冀鲁豫前线二日电】记者访问了新近俘虏的蒋军中将，五十五师的副师长理明亚，及七十师正副师长陈颐鼎、罗哲东，从他们的谈吐中，发现了一种显著的变化。过去蒋军高级俘虏总是把他们失败归之于偶然的军事过失，在军人不问政治的托词下，拒绝了解那根本的政治原因。但是现在不同了，理明亚说：“我们现在是毫无士气，不仅下级官兵，最严重的是我们这些将领，守城的早就没有信心，增援的拖一天算一天。理刚从南京受训回来，他说：最近蒋介石主办上校以上的军官训练，企图解决两个问题，除了检讨战术之外，主要的就是士气问题。理说：“那有什么办法？统帅部绝对不承认战略有错误，反而责备将领们不注意战术，不关心自己的生命荣辱，以致大批将领当了俘虏。对于士气，蒋只提出共荣共辱四个字。蒋说：我个人已经老了，没有什么关系，你们要是不好好干，最后失败了都是共产党革命的对象。这能解决什么问题？”理并说：“现在大家都想活动到国防部做事几乎成了风气，大家说我们这帮人不行了，还是提拔青年干部们来吧！有人一肚皮怨气，甚至唯恐不垮台，垮了台倒好，你我大家都一样。”大笑了一阵之后，他说：“这回我受训了一趟，一共花了四十多天，其实无论如何一个月是足足够了，可是大多数人躲来躲去，两三个月不归队，所以我们曹师长福林对我说：‘明亚，你还算老实’。”现认为士气低落的原因是：“那边政治太腐败了，完全脱离了群众，军队后面跟着的是八个大字：贪官污吏、土毫劣绅。前面忙着流血汗，后面忙着刮地皮，这怎么会有士气？”对这一问题，七十师的两个师长似乎更要深刻些。罗哲束满脸带着沉思的神情直截了当的说：“我们那边的问题是没有政治资本，你看北伐的时候，我们有明天的远景，今天打军阀明天革命成功，中间只隔一个短短的黎明时间，抗战的时候也是这样。现在呢，今天为了什么，明天是个什么样子？眼前一片漆黑，那里有勇气流血牺牲，怎么能不打败仗？”陈颐鼎说：“我们现在就不敢同部队讲话，能讲什么问题呢？”陈是黄埔三期毕业生，罗是四期，最近都到南京受了训，他们一再的提到北伐，一再的说到那时民众的蓬勃与北伐军士气的昂扬，和那种亲切的军民关系。罗说：“现在是你们成了当时的北伐军，我们成了当时的北洋军阀。”最后罗说：“我们要想打败你们是绝对不可能的了，现在只有希望你们的胜利快点。”
