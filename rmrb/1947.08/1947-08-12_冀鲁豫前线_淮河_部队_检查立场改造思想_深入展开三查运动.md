　　“Huai River” Troops on the JiluYu Frontline

　　Inspect Standpoint, Reform Ideology

　　Deeply Develop the Three Check-Ups Movement

　　[Report from JiluYu Frontline] Since the "Huai River" troops launched the Three Check-Ups Movement, preliminary results have been seen. First, a surge of inspecting standpoint and reforming ideology has been initiated among cadres. At the mobilization meeting of the branch, everyone expressed their determination to inspect and reform themselves. Second, many comrades have become more clear about their revolutionary standpoint. For example, Comrade He Zengde of the Cultural Work Troupe wrote a letter to the masses reporting on the hidden wealth buried at home. Comrade Shen Tonghua of the Second Detachment transformed the feudal family into a laboring family. Comrade Fan Yu of the × Department Office said at the mobilization meeting: "When my hometown is liberated in the future, I will definitely mobilize my family to return all the property they exploited from the peasants." In addition, the Three Check-Ups Movement relentlessly cracked down on the ideological erosion of our army by non-proletarian consciousness and speculators, and criticized behaviors that disregarded policies and created negative impacts. For example, Deng ××× of the Sixth Detachment believed that intellectuals were capable, and refused to accept the job assigned by the organization because he considered it of low status. After discussion by everyone, he said: "I joined the revolution to show off my skills and compete for a position, so that my family would think highly of me." Finally, with everyone's help, he clarified that joining the revolution means changing the landlord's standpoint and unconditionally serving the proletariat. The family of ××× of the Second Battalion was an object of struggle. In the past, he pretended to be progressive in the village and even joined our army in order to escape the mass struggle. In the army, he also used gifts to win over cadres. At the beginning of his self-examination, he completely adopted sophistry and an opposing attitude. Only after comrades' stern questioning and discussion did he admit that he was a speculator. Comrade He Sitong of the Fifth Detachment said during his self-examination: "Due to the serious development of hedonism, my standpoint was unclear, and I almost betrayed the revolution."

　　The acquisition of these results, in addition to the correctness of this call itself and the importance attached to it by the leadership, also lies in mastering the following methods and experiences: (1) The leadership has priorities and plans. They first determined that the focus of the Three Check-Ups Movement was on inspecting standpoint and work attitude, and reforming ideology. The entire mobilization first went from higher-level organs to the troops, and from within the Party to outside the Party. Because there are many cadres in the organs, they are close to the higher levels, and the awareness of the Party members is relatively high, they can first gain experience under the direct guidance of higher-level organizations to guide other parts. In terms of organizational leadership, the branch committee is the center, giving play to the role of the branch in ideological leadership and improving the political enthusiasm of Party members, so that the movement can be deepened and the non-Party masses can be led. In terms of implementation steps, first go through the process of studying documents, writing self-examinations, and informal talks to clear the cadres' minds, and then proceed to the second step of conducting discussions, extensively exposing thoughts, and studying correction methods. (2) Model demonstration, ideological mutual assistance, from practice to principles. At the beginning of the movement, some comrades felt that they did not know how to check, and did not know where to start. To solve this problem, each unit adopted the method of typical demonstration. For example, the Third Battalion started with the regimental committee, and the Second Battalion started by checking the battalion and regimental cadres. During the exposure, some started with veteran cadres and cadres who had undergone rectification, boldly and frankly speaking to enlighten everyone. Secondly, the check must first start with specific issues closely related to the individual, find out what to check, and then raise it to the height of principles for research, otherwise it will feel that the problem is complex and difficult to talk about. In addition, each unit developed ideological mutual assistance, and individuals combined with each other on the basis of mutual understanding and voluntary principles, which greatly assisted the meeting discussion. (3) Combining multiple aspects to deepen the movement. For example, combining it with accusing the landlords of their crimes to improve class consciousness and hatred; combining it with the spirit of working with peace of mind and serving the people to clarify that the class standpoint must be implemented in work and action; combining it with combat missions to improve combat command and technology; combining it with the spirit of implementing the Party's land reform policy and the Three Main Rules of Discipline and Eight Points for Attention.

　　冀鲁豫前线“淮河”部队
  　检查立场改造思想
  　深入展开三查运动
    【本报冀鲁豫前线讯】“淮河”自开展三查运动以来，已见初步效果。首先，在干部中掀起了检查立场与改造思想的热潮，在支部动员会上，每一个人都表示决心检查与改造自己。其次，许多同志更加明确了革命立场，如文工队贺增德同志，写信给群众报告家庭埋藏浮财。二区队申同华同志将封建家庭改造成劳动家庭；×部办公室樊钰同志在动员会上说：“将来我家乡解放了，我一定动员家里将剥削来的财产悉数退还农民。”另外，在三查中不容情地打击了非无产阶级意识及投机分子对我军的思想侵蚀，批判了不顾政策，破坏影响的行为。如六分队的邓×××认是知识分子能力强，组织上分配工作嫌地位小不干，经大家讨论后，他说：“自己参加革命是准备露一手，争个地位，叫家里看得起，”最后在大家帮助下他明确了：参加革命就得改变地主立场，无条件地为无产阶级服务。二大队×××的家里是斗争对象，过去他曾在村里假装进步以至参加我军，都是为了逃避群众斗争；在部队中，他又用送礼的方式拉拢干部，开始反省时他完全采取诡辩对立态度，经同志们严正的追究及讨论后，才承认了自己是投机分子。五分队何四通同志反省时说：“由于严重的享乐主义的发展，使自己立场不明确，几乎叛变革命”。
    这些效果的获得，除了这一号召本身的正确以及领导的重视外，还在于掌握了以下的方法和经验：（一）领导上有重点有计划。他们首先确定了三查的中心在于检查立场与工作态度，改造思想。整个的发动先由上级机关而下至部队，由党内而党外。因为机关干部多，和上级距离近，党内的觉悟性较高，可以在上级组织直接指导下首先取得经验指导其他部分。在组织领导上又以支委为中心，发挥了支部在思想领导上的作用，提高了党员的政治积极性，这样就能以使运动深入，使非党群众得到了领导。在进行步骤上，首先经过看文件、写反省、漫谈的酝酿过程，打通干部思想，第二步进行讨论，大量暴露思想，研究改正办法。（二）典型示范、思想互助，由实际到原则。运动开始时，曾有同志感觉不会查，不知从何查起等困难。要解决这一问题，各部都采用了典型示范的办法，如三大队先由团委查起，二大队先查营团干部，有的在暴露时，先由老干部、整过风的干部带头，大胆坦白的发言以启发大家。其次，检查必须先从个人切身有关的具体问题谈起，发现什么查什么，然后再把它提到原则高度作研究，否则便觉得问题庞杂无从谈起。此外，各部发展了思想互助，各个人在互相了解和自愿原则下相结合，这对会议讨论有极大辅助作用。（三）多方面的结合，使运动更步深入。如与控诉地主罪恶相结合，以提高阶级觉悟与仇恨；与安心工作，为人民服务的精神相结合，使其明确阶级立场必须贯澈于工作行动中去；与作战任务相结合，提高战斗指挥与技术；与执行党的土地改革政策，三大纪律八项注意的精神相结合。（孟冰）
