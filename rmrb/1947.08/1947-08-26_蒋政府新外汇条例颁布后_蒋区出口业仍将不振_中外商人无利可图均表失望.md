Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 24th: According to various sources, economic circles at home and abroad believe that the Jiang government's claim that the newly promulgated foreign exchange and trade regulations can "increase exports" and "balance foreign exchange" is unfounded. Pan Yangshan, Chairman of the Shanghai National Industries Association, stated on the 23rd that the adjustment of foreign exchange control measures will directly stimulate the prices of export commodities and indirectly affect the rise in general prices. Liu Zhongping, Chairman of the Vegetable Oil Exporters Association, stated that the export prospects for tung oil are dim, "If it is exported at a market price of 600,000 yuan per dan, plus various transportation and miscellaneous expenses, the profit will be minimal." Wen Shaohe, Chairman of the Raw Silk Exporters Association, pointed out that it is difficult to expect an increase in raw silk exports, and after the opening of trade with Japan, it may also seize a portion of China's export market, and China's silk industry is in danger of being eliminated. The person in charge of the Pharmaceutical Materials Association also expressed disappointment at increasing the export of medicinal materials, and stated that due to the soaring price of grain, the selling price of medicinal materials in producing areas has risen by 50%, and the transaction of medicinal materials in Shanghai has recently sharply decreased. Even the person in charge of the Jiang family's Central Trust Bureau said, "The expected quantity of export goods will not be affected by the adjustment of foreign exchange control measures."

In addition, according to a report from the Central News Agency in New York, on the second day after the promulgation of the new regulations, American importers in New York dealing in Chinese goods pointed out that this new policy did not benefit them at all. Among them, merchants engaged in the import of Chinese tea were particularly unenthusiastic about the new policy. The American Tea Association stated, "Due to the poor quality of tea, the new policy cannot promote or restore China's already declining tea market." The Wall Street Journal of the United States predicted on the 20th that due to the high import taxes in the United States, the export prospects of China's main export goods such as tung oil, silk, and walnuts are very dim. Inconvenient transportation affected by the continuous civil war has also prevented the export of pig bristles, wool, and camel hair. According to a report from the Central News Agency in London, the economic editor of The Times pointed out in his comments on the new foreign exchange regulations that the Jiang government "may be able to regain control of the foreign exchange market for a while under the new foreign exchange regulations, but due to the endless inflation and transportation conditions under the civil war, China's foreign exchange can never achieve a lasting balance."

　　蒋政府新外汇条例颁布后
  　蒋区出口业仍将不振
    中外商人无利可图均表失望
    【新华社陕北二十四日电】据各方消息：中外经济界均认为蒋政府宣传新外汇及贸易条例颁布后可以“增加出口”、“平衡外汇”是没有根据的。上海全国工协理事长潘仰山二十三日谈称：外制管办法调整后，将直接刺激出口品物价，间接还要影响一般物价上涨。植物油输出业协会理事长刘仲平称：桐油出口前途黯淡，“若以市价六十万元一担输出，再加运杂各费，则获利极微”。生丝输出业协会理事长温少鹤指出：生丝输出难望增加，且日本贸易开放后，还可能夺去我国一部分外销市场，中国丝事业有遭受淘汰危险。药材业协会负责人对增加药材外销亦表示失望，并称：由于粮价暴涨，药材产地售价已高涨百分之五十，最近上海药材交易锐减。甚至蒋家中央信托局负责人也说：“预计出口货物的数量，将不受外汇管制调整办法之影响。”
    另据中央社自纽约报导：在新条例公布的第二天，纽约经营中国商品的美国进口商，就指出：此一新政策对他们毫无所获。其中尤以从事中国茶叶进口的商人，对新政策毫无兴奋之象。美国茶业公会表示：“由于茶叶质量太差，新政策不能促进亦不能恢复中国在早已衰落的茶叶市场。”美国华尔街日报二十日预测：由于美国之高度进口税，中国主要出口货物桐油、蚕丝以及胡桃等的出口前途甚为暗淡。由于内战不停所影响的交通不便，又阻止了猪鬃、羊毛及骆驼毛之出口。另据中央社伦敦报导，泰晤士报经济编辑于对外汇新条例之评论中指出：蒋政府在新外汇条例下“或可恢复控制外汇市场于一时，但由于通货无止境膨胀及内战下的交通情况，中国外汇绝不能有长久的平衡。”
