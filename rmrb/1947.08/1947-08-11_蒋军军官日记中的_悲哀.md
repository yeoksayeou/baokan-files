　　The “Sorrow” in the Diary of a Chiang Kai-shek Army Officer

　　On July 14th, in the battle in Juye southeast Liuyingji, where our army annihilated the 70th Division of the Chiang Kai-shek army, we captured a diary belonging to the 6th Company Commander of the 2nd Battalion, 279th Regiment, 140th Brigade of that division. The diary is filled with their unending sorrow, beginning with the records about deserters:

　　May 1st, "Left Gunzhou, two soldiers deserted, and today another two deserted."

　　May 13th, "Another two ran away."

　　June 6th, the company bugler Hong Mingde deserted.

　　7th, "The soldier from the 8th squad carrying the machine gun ran off with a rifle."

　　8th, "Battalion Quartermaster Sergeant Wu Kunshui ran away with a pistol."

　　June 30th, "Woke up this morning and another two soldiers ran away."

　　Therefore, this company commander was extremely frustrated: "Heavens! How am I supposed to continue?" "It’s simply impossible to replenish them, or even if you replenish one today, two will run away tomorrow." (May 13th) "The combat strength of this company is very weak, sixty percent are new recruits." (June 21st) "The company's position has extended further to the right, I am really always prepared to die in action." (May 1st)

　　Regarding the taste of the empty villages created by the Chiang Kai-shek army:

　　He wrote: "I ran through more than a dozen villages and didn't see a single civilian." (June 14th)

　　"We stopped at Changyi for a long time, and didn't even see a ghost. All the civilians had fled." (June 18th)

　　"The civilians still haven't returned. It's like the Eighth Route Army wants to blockade us… The brothers haven't had any oil for two meals." (June 17th)

　　But just not having oil is still good. "Since yesterday morning, the entire brigade hasn't had anything to eat, it's really deadly, there's nothing, only starvation." (May 10th)

　　"At 7:30, I led two platoons to Xin Tiao River to receive rice, arriving at 9:30. The Jining Security Brigade and the division's search company also arrived one after another, their mission was also to cover the rice passing through Xin Tiao River... Waited until 2:30 in the afternoon, and the rice still hadn't arrived." (May 21st)

　　From May 22nd to 24th, for three days, they were "the whole battalion went to Ya Temple to cover the entire regiment buying vegetables" (meaning armed robbery of vegetables) "It's really exhausting." (June 2nd)

　　The destruction of the 55th Division made him clearly aware of the fate that was about to befall him. He wrote on July 8th: "This morning, three officers who escaped from the division headquarters (referring to the 55th Division) were as disheveled as stray dogs. I asked them about the situation in Yuncheng, and they answered with unspeakable sorrow: 'Yuncheng is finished.' They haven't eaten since escaping from Yuncheng yesterday morning. They hid in the sorghum fields during the day and walked at night. When they were hungry, sorghum stalks were the only thing they ate. If this is said to be the way out for the National Army, it is better to say it is the National Army's end."

　　And the next day (10th), on the way from Jiaxiang to Juye, he saw Cao Fulin fleeing in disarray. He wrote: "On the way, we encountered the commander of the 55th Division, wearing plain clothes, covered in mud, sitting dejectedly in an ox cart. Chen, the company commander of the artillery company, once rebuked him for blocking the road with the ox cart. His guards said: He is the commander of the 55th Division. We all stuck out our tongues. Alas, how grand and majestic the division commander used to be! And now, sitting in an ox cart, fleeing in disarray, this is something he himself could never have dreamed of. This is perhaps the only way out for the National Army."

　　Originally, this company commander was already frightened out of his wits. Just look at his diary in Jiaxiang on July 2nd; "I am lying sick in bed, and my heart is always thinking, if the 'bandits' attack the city, a cannonball hits my house accurately, or the shell lands right on my bed. I will immediately be reduced to powder." Therefore, when he heard the rumor that their division was to be transferred to Hunan for rest and reorganization, he wrote: "Excited beyond measure, praying that this news can become a reality." (May 23rd)

　　By July, when he understood things better, he no longer had such illusions. He wrote: "It seems that we won't be able to rest until we are completely wiped out." Therefore, he hoped to be "wiped out so we can go and rest." (July 4th). As a result, exactly ten days later, on July 14th, the 70th Division was "completely wiped out."

### 蒋军军官日记中的“悲哀”

　　蒋军军官日记中的“悲哀”
    七月十四日，我军在巨野东南六营集、歼灭蒋军七十师的战斗中，缴获该师一四○旅二七九团二营六连连长的一本日记。日记中充满了他们不可终止的悲哀，首先是关于逃兵的记载：
    五月一日，“由衮州出发，逃了两个兵，今天又逃了两个兵”。
    五月十三日，“又跑了两个”
    六月六日，连部号兵洪明德，开了小差。
    七日、“第八班那个背机枪的兵拐一支步枪跑了”。
    八日、“营部军需上士吴坤水拐了一支手枪逃了”。
    六月三十日、“早晨一起床又跑了两个兵。”
    于是这个连长沮丧极了：“天啊！叫我如何干下去”，“根本就补不胜补，甚或你今天补一个，他明天要跑两个”。（五月十三日）本连战力薄弱得很，百分之六十是新兵。（六月二十一日）“本连阵地，又向右延伸了，我实在时时准备着，有事时一个死”。（五月一日）
    关于老百姓对蒋军空室清野的滋味。
    他写道：“跑遍了十几个村子，没有看见一个老百姓。”（六月十四日）
    “我们在昌邑集停很久，连一个鬼影子都没有看到，老百姓都逃亡一空”。（六月十八日）。
    “老百姓一直到现在还没有回来一个。简直八路是想向我们封锁，……弟兄们两餐没吃一点油了。”（六月十七日）
    但是单单没有油还算好的。“自昨早上起，全旅人都没有饭吃真要命，什么都没有，只有挨饿”（五月十日）。
    “七时半又是率两排人去新挑河接米，九时半到达，济宁保安大队，和师部搜索连，也陆续到达，他们的任务也是掩护米，通过新挑河……一直等到下午两点半钟，米还没有到”。（五月二十一日）
    在五月二十二日到二十四日三天中，他们就“全营赴牙庙掩护全团买菜”（按即武装抢菜）“真弄的疲于奔命”。（六月二日）
    五十五师的溃灭，使他清楚的意识到了自己将要来到的下场。他在七月八日写道：“今晨该师（按指五十五师）师部逃下来三个官长都狼狈的如丧家之犬，我问他们郓城情形，他们都不胜悲哀地答着：‘郓城完了。’他们自昨晨由郓城逃出后，一直没有吃过饭。白天藏在高粱地里，夜晚走路，肚子饿了，高粱秆是他们唯一吃的东西，这如果说是国军的出路，不如说是国军的下场”。
    而就在翌日（十日）由嘉祥去巨野的途中，他又看见了落荒而逃的曹福林。他写道：“在途中碰到五十五师师长，穿着便衣，满身都是泥巴，狼狈的坐在一辆牛车上，垂头丧气。打炮连陈连长曾斥他为什么把牛车拦着路，他的卫士说：他是五十五师师长，我们都把舌头一伸，唉，多堂哉皇哉的师长啦！而今呢坐着牛车、落荒而逃，这真是他自己也梦想不到啦，这也就是国军唯一的出路吧。”
    本来这个连长是早已吓破了胆的，且看他七月二日在嘉祥的日记吧；“余卧病床中，心老是这样想，如果‘匪’来攻城，一炮打准了我住的房子或者炮弹正落在我的床上。我立刻变成粉碎。”因此他听到谣传说他们师要要调到湖南休整时，他就写着：“兴奋的了不得，祈祷这消息能成事实”。（五月二十三日）
    等到了七月以后，当他更明白了一些的时候，他就不这样的幻想了，他写着：“看样子不打光是不会下去休息的”。因而希望“打光了好去休息”。（七月四日），结果恰恰就在十天后的七月十四日，七十师就被“打光了”。（新华社冀鲁豫前线电稿）
