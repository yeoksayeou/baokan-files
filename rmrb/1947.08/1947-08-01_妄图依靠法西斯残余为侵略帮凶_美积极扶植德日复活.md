Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 29th. Comprehensive report: U.S. imperialism has decided to support the revival of German and Japanese fascist remnants as its two major accomplices in aggression in Europe and Asia. The day after the U.S. unilaterally decided to convene a discussion on the Japanese peace treaty (the 17th), the Howard-affiliated World Telegram revealed that the U.S. had adopted a "new realistic policy" in Europe and Asia. The content of this so-called "new policy" has been fully disclosed by the New York Times, the official mouthpiece of the U.S. The newspaper stated: "The U.S. proposal for preliminary discussions on the Japanese peace treaty is one of two steps taken by the U.S. since announcing the Truman Doctrine and the Marshall Plan to change its foreign policy; another step is the U.S. order to the U.S. military government in Germany to re-industrialize Germany." In interpreting Marshall's speech in Salt Lake City, the newspaper further believed that "suppressing the industrial level of enemy countries" and the four powers' "commitment to peaceful cooperation" were "two mistakes in U.S. wartime and post-war foreign policy." It also revealed: "The steps currently taken by the U.S. are a method to improve this 'mistake' in a timely manner." On the Japanese issue, following Hoover's advocacy of a separate peace treaty between the U.S. and Japan, MacArthur recently specifically proposed that "a peace treaty with Japan could be concluded within the year"; a United Press dispatch on the 16th further revealed: "Marshall is prepared to abandon Soviet participation if necessary and proceed directly with a peace treaty with Japan." The Japanese reactionaries have already shouted "welcome" and "gratitude" for the U.S.'s move to convene a peace conference. On the German issue, U.S. Secretary of Commerce Harriman recently publicly declared that he would "strive to enable Germany to obtain a proper position in the European economy," and former U.S. Undersecretary of State Acheson even stated: "Without the restoration of German production, there can be no true revival in Europe" (U.S. Information Service, 22nd). An Associated Press report on the 22nd regarding the U.S. plan for Germany also stated: "The U.S. only requires putting some muscle on the bones of certain old private systems." All of this shows that the U.S.'s conspiracy to help Germany and Japan rise again has become a major part of the U.S.'s current foreign policy.
Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 26th. Various sources: On the 23rd, the U.S. State Department announced the cancellation of aid to Poland and Hungary. It is reported that this is because the U.S. does not like the democratic regimes in those two countries. However, at the same time, the Rome correspondent for the "New York Herald Tribune" reported that the U.S. government recently sold $184 million worth of surplus military supplies to Italy to help the political parties favored by the U.S. The correspondent stated: This transaction is a means for the U.S. to interfere in Italy's internal affairs. Last September, when Italian conservative Finance Minister Copini insisted on staying in office despite opposition from the people, the U.S. sold surplus materials worth $595 million to Italy for the low price of $160 million. The U.S. reactionaries' "gold yuan diplomacy" has another obvious example.

    妄图依靠法西斯残余为侵略帮凶
    美积极扶植德日复活
    【新华社陕北二十九日电】综合报导：美帝国主义已决定扶植德日法西斯余孽复活，作为其在欧亚进行侵略的两大帮凶。在美国片面决定召开讨论对日和约之翌日（十七日），霍华德系世界电讯报即透露美国在欧亚已采取了“新的现实政策”。这种所谓“新政策”的内容，美官方喉舌纽约时报已将其和盘托出。该报称：“美国之建议初步讨论对日和约，系美宣布杜鲁门政策及马歇尔计划而改变其外交政策以来所采取的两种步骤之一；另一步骤为美国命令德境美军政府使德国重新工业化。”该报在诠释马歇尔盐湖城的演说时，更认为：“压抑敌国工业水平，”及四强“致力和平合作办法”是“美国战时及战后外交政策上的两种错误”。并泄露：“目前美国所采取的步骤，为适时改良此种‘错误’之方法。”在对日问题上，继胡佛主张美国对日本单独媾和之后，麦克阿瑟最近更具体提出“对日和约可于年内成立”；合众社十六日电更透露：“马歇尔准备必要时放弃苏联之参加，迳自着手对日和约。”日本反动派对美国召开和会之举已高呼“欢迎”和“感激”。在对德问题上，美商务部长哈立曼最近公开宣称要“努力使德国在欧洲经济中取得适当地位”，美前副国务卿亚泽逊更称：“德国生产未恢复，欧洲即无真正复兴可言”（美新闻处二十二日电）。美联社二十二日报导：美对德计划时也说：“美国仅要求在某些旧的私有制度的骸骨上放一些肌肉”。这一切显示美国扶助德日再起之阴谋，已成为美国当前外交政策的主要内容。
    【新华社陕北二十六日电】各方讯：二十三日，美国务院宣布取消对波兰及匈牙利之援助。据悉，因美国不喜欢该两国的民主政权。但同时，“纽约先驱论坛报”驻罗马记者则报导称：美国政府最近将一亿八千四百万美元剩余军用物资售予意大利，以帮助美国所赞成的政党。该记者称：这次交易是美国干涉意国内政的手段。去年九月，当意国保守派财政部长科皮诺不顾国人反对而强求留任时，美国就将价值五亿九千五百万美元的剩余物资以一亿六千万元低价售予意大利。美国反动派的“金圆外交”，又获一明显例证。
