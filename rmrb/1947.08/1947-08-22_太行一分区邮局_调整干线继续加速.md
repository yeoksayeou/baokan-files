　　Taihang First District Post Office
  　Adjusts Trunk Lines to Continue Acceleration
    [This newspaper's Taihang dispatch] Since the Taihang Post Office launched the speed campaign, most bureaus and stations have enthusiastically started the wave, with many "flying legs" and "iron shoulders" emerging, speeding up the delivery of mail. In comparison, the First District found that its mail delivery was still very slow. Yuanshi could only see the People's Daily of the 1st on the 8th, and the New China Daily of the 1st on the 9th. After checking the reasons, the main problem was that the connection of trunk line times was not tight enough. For example, it is sixty li from Wu'an to Shahe, and it can be reached in the morning, but Shahe only departs the next day, and the mail is parked for half a day. After research, the trunk line from Wu'an to Yuanshi was adjusted, changing the sixty li to a half-day system. Wu'an arrives at Shahe in the morning, and Shahe departs in the afternoon, so that the mail can travel one hundred and twenty li a day. In this way, from Wu'an to Yuanshi is twice as fast as before, so that Yuanshi and Zanhuang can see the newspaper in four or five days. (Yi Yun)

　　太行一分区邮局
  　调整干线继续加速
    【本报太行讯】太行邮局自开展速度运动以来，大部局站都热火朝天的掀起浪潮，涌现出许多飞毛腿铁肩膀，增快了邮件的转递，对比之下，一分区发现自己一切邮件转递还是很慢，元氏在八号才能看到一号的人民日报，九号看到一号的新华日报。经检查原因，主要问题是干线时间的衔接不够紧，如武安到沙河六十里，上午即可到达，但沙河是次日才出发，邮件便停放半天。后经研究，将武安至元氏之干线加以调整，改六十里为半日制，武安上午到沙河，沙河下午即出发，使邮件一天能走一百二十里，这样从武安到元氏比前快了一倍，使元氏赞皇在四五天即可看到报纸。　　（一耘）
