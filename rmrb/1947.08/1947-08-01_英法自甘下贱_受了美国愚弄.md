    Britain and France Voluntarily Degrade Themselves
    Fooled by the United States
    【Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 27th】 TASS, Moscow: *Pravda* recently published an article by the famous political commentator Zaslavsky, "The End of Voluntary Degradation," commenting on Britain and France being fooled by the American Marshall Plan. The article stated: "The intoxicating week in Paris has passed (referring to the so-called "European Economic Recovery Conference"), and the illusions blossomed quickly and withered quickly like flowers. Now is the time for remorse and shame. The people who were deceived ask: "What is going on?" The facts answer: "It's something ridiculous and extremely indecent!" Western Europe has never suffered such humiliation. The poverty and needs of the people of Western Europe have become dirty and worthless political toys. People say that this is a record of those "outstanding" politicians voluntarily debasing themselves and being obsequious and flattering, which is indeed an appropriate comment. Currently, the great British and French politicians have placed themselves in a ridiculous position. They humbly help American financial tycoons and try their best to catch the American train, but unfortunately, they missed it. Bevin, in order to salvage the defeat, melancholically "advised" the people of Western Europe to "do their best to save themselves." Poor politicians, trapped in the mud and about to drown, did not taste the cake (referring to American loan assistance) but ate a mouthful of mud."

    英法自甘下贱
    受了美国愚弄
    【新华社陕北二十七日电】塔斯社莫斯科讯：真理报顷发表著名政论家萨斯拉夫斯基“自甘卑贱的下场”一文，评论英法之受美国马歇尔计划的愚弄。文内称：“巴黎陶醉的一周已经消逝了（指所谓“欧洲经济复兴会议”），幻想如花似的迅速开放又迅速凋谢。现在到了愧悔交加的时候了。被朦蔽的人民问道：“这是什么回事？”事实回答说：“这是一种可笑而极不体面的东西！”西欧从来不曾受过这样的侮辱，西欧人民的贫困与需要成了不干净和无价值的政治玩物。人们说这是那些“出色”的政治家们的自甘作贱与恭顺谄媚的纪录，这确是恰当的评语。目前，英法的大政治家们已使自己陷于一种可笑的地位，他们卑屈的去帮助美国金融巨头，竭力奔跑去赶搭美国火车，可惜扑了一个空。贝文为了挽救败局，忧郁地“劝告”西欧人民“尽自己力量拯救自己”。可怜这些陷在污泥中行将没顶的政治家们，没有尝到饼子（指美国的贷款援助）却吃了满口烂泥。”
