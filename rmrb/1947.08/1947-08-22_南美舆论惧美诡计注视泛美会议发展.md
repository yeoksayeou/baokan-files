Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 20th. Reports from various sources: Democratic public opinion in South American countries is watching the development of the Rio de Janeiro conference with suspicion and fear. The Argentine newspaper "La Hora" stated: "At the Pan-American Conference, many tricks harmful to the independence of our country and other Latin American countries will occur." The newspaper pointed out: This situation can only be effectively resisted by reforming the national economy. This means establishing domestic heavy industry without relying on foreign markets, and trading with non-imperialist countries in the Americas, the Soviet Union, and new democratic countries in Europe. Former Colombian President Santos warned in "American Review": "A large amount of armaments will not only prolong the power of Latin American tyrants, but also mean the economic bankruptcy of Latin America."

　　南美舆论惧美诡计注视泛美会议发展
    【新华社陕北二十日电】各方讯：南美国家民主舆论以疑惧之心情，注视里约热内卢会议之发展。阿根廷“拉、奥拉”报称：“在泛美会议上，将发生许多危害我国及拉丁美洲其他国家独立的诡计”。该报指出：这种情况只有用改组国民经济的办法，才能予以有效抵抗。这就是不依靠外国市场建立本国重工业，以及与美洲非帝国主义国家、苏联及欧洲新民主主义等国通商。前哥伦比亚总统散托思在“美洲评论”上著文警告称：“大量军备将不仅延续拉丁美洲暴君的权力，而且意味着拉丁美洲经济的破产”。
