Title: Jiao Currency Brings Endless Disaster, Shanxi Southern Shanxi Fan Merchants Also Suffer

The ancient town of Fencheng has a phenomenon rarely seen in history. Regardless of adults or children, businesses or people coming to the market, they all shake fans made of folded "legal tender" to drive away the summer heat. It is said that in addition to dispelling heat, these fans are also rumored to have two other functions and purposes. One is to try to use the wind of the "legal tender fan" to fan away the disasters brought by the "legal tender" notes; the other is to save money on buying cattail leaf fans.

These kinds of fans were popular for a while in early summer. Later, because the Kuomintang puppet county government took the opportunity to extort 500,000 yuan in "fines" from a Mr. Zhao in Zhengtou Village, and warned citizens: "From now on, anyone who folds fans with 'legal tender' will be accused of insulting the country and intending to betray it," so the "legal tender fans" temporarily disappeared from circulation.

The "legal tender" used to fold fans is brand new, and some even have consecutive serial numbers, which is said to help drive away the disasters of the "legal tender" more quickly. On the counter of a grocery store called Qingsheng, I picked up two fans made of 500-yuan "legal tender" notes, each with sixteen notes, with serial numbers ranging from "2596302" to "259633." I couldn't help but ask in surprise: "Shopkeeper, your store has a very strong capital base, how can you be so wasteful?" At first, he didn't seem to understand what I meant and looked at me for a long time without saying anything. Later, he smiled wryly and said, "You're talking about these fans, they're not called money anymore. Now 500 yuan of 'legal tender' can't even buy a grain of rice on the market. When the Chiang government was in power, it had already ordered that banknotes worth less than 500 yuan be prohibited from circulation. Which store hasn't thrown away hundreds of thousands of yuan? Even my small business has thrown hundreds of thousands of yuan into the latrine! More than a dozen stores on the street have closed down because the 500-yuan 'legal tender' is prohibited from circulation. You say, should we use these banknotes to wallpaper the walls? That's too wasteful of paste. Should we use them to wipe our bottoms? They're too slippery. Nobody wants them, so folding them into fans is the only useful thing to do."

Indeed, the value of the "legal tender" continues to fall. On June 3rd, before our army arrived, the exchange rate between the Jicha currency and the "legal tender" on the black market was one to eight. On the 6th, after our army arrived, it immediately became one to twelve, and on the 9th, it became one to fifteen. In early May, only 50-yuan "legal tender" notes were stopped from circulation. By the end of June, 500-yuan notes were also stopped from circulation. Later, when 10,000-yuan "legal tender" notes appeared on the market, merchants panicked and shouted, "The 1,000-yuan 'legal tender' notes are about to be stopped from circulation!" Therefore, people are trying their best to sell "legal tender" and hoard goods, and prices are racing, rising three times from morning to night.

Leaving the north gate of the ancient town, you can see countless poor children kicking away "legal tender" on the garbage heaps every day and picking up small pieces of coke from the garbage heaps.

The plummeting value of the "legal tender" has made everyone in the Kuomintang-occupied areas suffer. Many merchants selling cattail leaf fans on the street have seen their business decline due to the popularity of "legal tender fans." When asked about the market for their cattail leaf fans, they always say with resentment: "This year, our cattail leaf fan business has been ruined by Chiang Kai-shek's 'legal tender.' The cattail leaf fans used in the counties in western Shanxi are all produced near our Xiangling city. In the past, we would sell thousands of fans at every market, but this year we can't even sell a few!"

### 蒋币带来无穷灾难晋南蒲扇商也倒霉

　　蒋币带来无穷灾难晋南蒲扇商也倒霉
    汾城的古城镇，有一种历史上所少见的现象，无论大人小孩，商号或赶集来的人，手里都摇着用“法币”折成的扇子，以驱赶炎夏的暑热。据说用这种扇子除去热外，尚传说有两种作用与目的。一种是企图用“法币扇子”的风，扇去“法币”票给带来的灾难；一是可以节省下买蒲草扇子的钱。
    这种扇子初夏时曾风行一时，后因蒋伪县政府借此敲榨了正北头姓赵的五十万元的“罚款”，并警告市民：“今后凡用‘法币’折扇子者，以轻侮国家，有心通叛论罪”，因此“法币扇子”亦会一时藏行匿迹。
    用作折扇子的“法币”均是新崭崭的，有的连号码也不乱，据说这样可使“法币”的灾难更快的赶跑。在一个叫庆胜杂货铺的柜台上，我检起了两柄都是五百元“法币”折成的扇子，每柄十六张，号码是从“２５９６３０２”起，到“２５９６３３”止，我不禁惊奇地问：“掌柜，你这个商店资本很雄厚吧，怎么这样浪费呢？”开始他好象未弄清我的意思，看了我好久未说话，后来他才苦笑了一下说：“你说这扇子吧，那已经不叫钱了。现在五百元的‘法币’在市上连一颗米也买不下，蒋政府在时，已下令五百元以下的票币禁止流通，那个商店不扔几十万元呢？就我这小本买卖，也把百八十万元扔到茅坑去了！街上有十几家商店已因五百元‘法币’禁止流通而关了门。你说这些票子裱墙壁吧，太浪费面糊，擦屁股吧，太滑；给谁谁不要，还只有作折作扇子算是有点用处。”
    确实，“法币”的价值还在继续下跌。六月三日我军还未到那里，冀钞与“法币”在暗市上比值是一比八，六日我军到了后，马上成了一比十二，九日便又成为一比十五；五月初还只是五十元的“法币”停止流通，到六月底五百元的也停止了流通，后来市面又出现了一万元币值的“法币”后，商人便惊惶的嚷着：“一千元的‘法币’又要停止流通了”。因此，人们都在尽量推销“法币”，囤积货物，物价跟着赛跑，从晨到晚，连涨三次。
    出了古城镇的北门，你可以看到每天有无数的穷孩子在垃圾堆上踢开了“法币”，而拾起垃圾堆内的小焦炭块。
    “法币”的狂跌，苦了蒋占区所有的人。街上很多卖蒲草扇的商人，因“法币扇子”风行而生意冷落。当问及他们蒲草扇子的行情时，他们总是愤恨的说：“今年我们这蒲扇就垮在这蒋介石的‘法币’上头了，晋西这几县所用的蒲草扇，全是我们襄陵城附近的出产，往年那一集不卖几千把扇子，今年连几把都卖不出手！”
