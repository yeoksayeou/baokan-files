　　Huguan Areas' Emancipated Women
  　Actively Join the Militia
    [Report from our Huguan Bureau] In order to support the counter-offensive, ten young women from Eryangjia Village in the Sixth District actively participated in the militia. When the troops sent prisoners to be stationed in the village, the female militia automatically guarded the prisoners at night; when supplies passed through the village, the female militia actively carried them, sometimes continuously six times a day (each trip was five *li*). When the women of Chengdong Street commemorated the Party's birthday, Shen Lianze said: "We have been emancipated, women have a position, and I want to participate in the militia with practical work to commemorate the Party." Under his influence, twelve young women with unbound feet joined the militia. In Hanzhuang, under the leadership of Xu Pangze, twenty-four women successively signed up. Liu Wenjing, the wife of Xiang Tishui, a hero of ten *li*, said: "In the old society, my big feet couldn't walk in front of people. Since the Communist Party came, big feet are an honor, and I want to voluntarily join the militia." Thus, under her and Yang Songqiao's influence, twenty-two young women rushed to sign up. In Huanghuashui, under the leadership of Wang Jingze, the wife of the political director, and Chen Buai, all sixteen women in the village actively participated and formulated plans to perform meritorious services. After the women of Nanyanghu joined the militia, they actively engaged in production and land reclamation, and gathered vegetables to promote the masses with exemplary actions.

    [Report from our Shahe Bureau] To welcome the "September 2nd" Militia Day, the Sixth District Military Committee discussed the work done by the militia in production and overcoming the famine in the first half of the year. Thirty-five militiamen and armed cadres from six villages including Xicui and Nanwang were commended for meritorious service. Fourteen people were awarded major merits, eleven people were awarded second-class merits, and ten people were awarded third-class merits. Li Hongzhi, the militia instructor of Xicui, led the village in mutual aid in production, and the mutual aid group he led never collapsed. After discussion by the masses, he was awarded the first major merit in the village. Gao Cunshan, a militiaman from Ge Village, took the lead in setting an example in the mutual aid group, urging people to get up, and staying in the fields at night during the drought. This influenced the entire group, so that the well was never idle, day or night. After the rain, he helped the families of soldiers to plant buckwheat, and in his spare time, he helped the newly developed militia learn how to use guns. The masses awarded him a major merit.
