Editor's Note: The Greek People's Guerrilla Force is growing stronger in battle, constantly capturing towns. According to Turkish news, the People's Guerrilla Force in Thrace has recently launched a counterattack, threatening the northern Greek port of Salonika. At the same time, the United States is providing more active assistance to the traitorous dictatorial government of Greece. The first batch of American military supplies arrived in Greece on August 3rd; the United States is also actively instigating Turkey to send troops to Greece, and Turkish heavy troops have gathered on the western border. The ambition of the United States lies not only in controlling Greece and Turkey, but also in attempting to use this as a base to invade the new democratic countries of Southeast Europe. Last autumn, it instigated Greek fascists to attack Albania. Recently, it has instigated Greek fascists to provoke the borders of Yugoslavia and Bulgaria. Yugoslavia and Bulgaria signed a treaty of friendship, cooperation, and mutual assistance on the first of this month (see the headline on this page today). The united strength of the new democratic countries is very strong. They are determined to defend their own interests and defend the democratic peace of Europe and the world. The imperialists' aggressive conspiracies are bound to fail.

Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 3rd -- Reports from various sources: After signing the so-called "aid agreements" with Greece and Turkey, American imperialism is further interfering in and controlling the internal affairs of these two countries. According to the "Geneva News," Turkey has completely entrusted its military affairs to the American military delegation. The Turkish General Staff is filled with American advisors and is becoming an appendage of the United States. At the same time, American capital is also extensively invading Turkey. Branches of American banks and companies are opening one after another in Turkey. American experts even openly stated that the "modernization" (meaning Americanization) of the Turkish economy not only creates unprecedentedly favorable conditions for the import of American capital, but will also lead to the transformation of the Turkish economy into an appendage of American capital.

　　美进一步控制希土图作侵略欧洲基地
    编者按：希腊人民游击队在战斗中日渐壮大，不断攻克城镇，据土耳其消息，色雷斯方面之人民游击队近又展开反击，已威胁希腊北部港口萨罗尼加。同时，美国对希腊卖国独裁政府的帮助就更加积极。第一批美国军火已于八月三日运抵希腊；美国并积极怂恿土耳其派遣军队到希腊去，土耳其重兵已在西部边疆集合。美国的野心不仅在于控制希土，还妄图以此作为基地，侵略东南欧新民主国家。去年秋天就曾怂恿希腊法西斯分子进攻过阿尔巴尼亚，近来又唆使希腊法西斯份子向南斯拉夫与保加利亚边疆挑衅。南保两国已于本月一日签订友好合作互助协定（参看今日本版头条），新民主国家团结起来的力量是很强大的，它们决心保卫自己的利益，保卫欧洲及世界的民主和平，帝国主义者的侵略阴谋必然要归于失败。
    【新华社陕北三日电】各方讯：美帝国主义在与希腊、土耳其签订所谓“援助协定”后，正进一步干涉和控制，该两国的内政。据“日内瓦新闻”报载称，土耳其已将军事问题完全委托给美国军事代表团，土参谋总部充满着美国顾问，并正在变为美国的附属品。同时，美国资本亦在广泛侵入土耳其，美国银行与公司的分行分公司亦纷纷在土开张。美国专家甚至公开说，土耳其经济的“现代化”（按即美国化），不仅对美国资本之输入创造了空前有利的条件，而且将引致土国经济之变为美国资本的附庸。
