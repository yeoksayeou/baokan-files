Xinhua News Agency, Central China, 21st—The rural economy in the Northern Jiangsu Liberated Area is stable. The average price index at the end of June increased by only 0.9 times compared to December of last year. The price of imported goods such as kerosene is even lower than last winter. After Chiang Kai-shek's troops occupied the counties and cities of Northern Jiangsu last winter, prices once rose. However, through the planned organization of import and export trade by the democratic government, and the promotion of guerrilla business in the border areas, prices began to decline sharply by the end of March this year. The currency of Central China enjoys extremely high credit, and it still maintains a ratio of one to eight with the Chiang Kai-shek currency.

　　苏北解放区物价平稳币值高
    【新华社华中二十一日电】苏北解放区农村经济稳定。六月底物价平均指数较去年十二月份仅涨零点九倍。煤油等进口货价格，且低于去冬。去冬蒋军侵占苏北各县城后，物价曾一度上涨。旋经民主政府有计划组织出入口贸易，并于边缘区提倡游击营业，至今年三月下旬，各货即直趋下降。华中货币信用极高，迄今仍与蒋币保持一与八之比。
