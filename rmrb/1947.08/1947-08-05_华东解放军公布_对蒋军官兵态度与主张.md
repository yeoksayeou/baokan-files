Xinhua News Agency, East China Front, August 2nd: The East China People's Liberation Army (PLA) has recently announced its "Attitude and Stance Towards Kuomintang (KMT) Officers and Soldiers," with the following key points:

    (1) Policy of Peace. The PLA advocates peace and democracy, supports the line of political consultation, and opposes traitorous acts, using foreign debts to wage civil war, and the bellicose and dictatorial policies that oppress the people. It hopes that patriotic officers and soldiers and true followers of Mr. Sun Yat-sen will not be enemies of the people, will be dilatory in battle, cease fighting, withdraw from the liberated areas, and strive to build a truly independent, peaceful, unified, and democratic coalition government and a new China.

    (2) Policy of Self-Defense. For KMT troops invading the liberated areas, those who do not immediately lay down their weapons when the PLA launches self-defense counterattacks will be annihilated. Those who do not resist and lay down their weapons early, or even revolt in their positions, will receive special welcome and preferential treatment from our army and the democratic government of the liberated areas.

    (3) Policy of Leniency. KMT soldiers who lay down their weapons, regardless of rank, will not be killed or insulted, and their private property will not be confiscated. The wounded will be treated. Those who wish to return home will be given travel expenses. Those who wish to study and have the potential can enter various levels of special political schools. Those who wish to find employment will be introduced to jobs. Those who wish to join the PLA are welcome to enlist. All those who participate in the work, study, and troops of the liberated areas and the PLA will be treated equally, employed according to their talents, and promoted based on merit.

    (4) Policy of Cooperation. The PLA is willing to sincerely cooperate with any KMT army that sympathizes with democracy and does not want civil war and has made some contribution to the people. The PLA and the democratic government are willing to provide all possible and necessary assistance to KMT troops who are determined to fight for peace and democracy, voluntarily withdraw from the civil war, wish to serve the people, fight for democracy, or launch uprisings, guaranteeing their supplies and helping them to consolidate and develop. KMT personnel who have contributed to the voluntary withdrawal from the civil war will be rewarded and promoted.

    The above proclamation is signed by Chen Yi, Commander and Political Commissar of the East China People's Liberation Army Field Army, Su Yu, Deputy Commander, and Tan Zhenlin, Deputy Political Commissar.

Xinhua News Agency, East China Front, August 2nd: The Political Department of the East China PLA has recently announced the following regulations for meritorious service in carrying out political offensives:

    (1) Those who respond to the call for a political offensive and find social connections to facilitate the disintegration of the enemy will be awarded Fourth to Second Class Merit; those with special achievements will be awarded Special Class Merit. Family members of KMT and puppet soldiers can also earn merit.

    (2) Those who carry out propaganda work and have factual evidence that the enemy troops have been affected will be awarded Third to First Class Merit. Those who organize shouting or individual shouting to weaken the enemy's resistance will be awarded Third to Second Class Merit; those whose shouting causes the enemy to surrender their weapons will be awarded merit according to the provisions of Article 1.

    (3) Those with good battlefield discipline, who do not search prisoners' pockets, and who can supervise others to enforce discipline and supervise prisoners to prevent accidents, and whose actions are decisive will be awarded Second to First Class Merit.
