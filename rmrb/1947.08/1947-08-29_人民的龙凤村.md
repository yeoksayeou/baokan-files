　　The People's Longfeng Village

　　　　(1) Collective Transfer and "New Mountain Gully Life."
    The transfer of the masses in Longfeng Village, Jiexiu, originally started during the mass movement in March of this year. Later, the struggle became increasingly acute. By the time of the summer harvest, moving out of the village at night to rest had become a collective action for the entire village. At dusk, you would hear Ji Laiguan (通讯员), a emancipated tenant farmer, shouting while knocking: "Drain the wells, move the water, bring the steamers and stoves, carry the rice and noodles (bring them), bury the shovels, take down the well frames and wheels, quickly hide your grain, and carry your bundles (bedding), to ×× to sleep tonight!" Then you would hear: "The masses have left, the militia have set the mines, and the militia will be on guard at dawn!"
    Look! As soon as Comrade Laiguan's gong rang, the masses indeed carried their bedding bundles, led their livestock, and headed towards the designated place—New Longfeng.
    "New Longfeng" was a place with steep cliffs on both sides and a narrow path in the middle, with a strategic terrain, "one person can block the entrance, ten thousand cannot pass." The militiamen laid mines, spread grass, and combined guns and mines, guarding day and night. Especially at night, after all the masses had fallen asleep, the vigilance was particularly strict. It was absolutely impossible for the "bandit troops" to sneak in and break through.

　　　　(2) Paving the Streets Movement and Rush Harvesting.
    The summer harvest season arrived. As the core of the "Honeybee Joint Defense" in the third district of Jiexiu, Guo Jianming, an emancipated tenant farmer in Longfeng Village, initiated the paving the streets movement. He led the militia to pave all the streets, large and small, in the village with wheat straw and cinder, laying all kinds of mines, some real and some fake, some on the main street, some on the doorways, some in the threshing ground, and some by the waterside.
    On June 26th, bandits from Nanzhuang Village, two miles away from Longfeng, attempted to steal the villagers' wheat. Under such tense combat conditions, the masses of Longfeng "took up guns in one hand and sickles in the other," and began a rush harvest.
    First, based on the principle of voluntary association, led by Ji Guoning, the first small mutual aid group of seven people appeared in Longfeng. They harvested 73 mu of wheat in three days, threshed it all, hid it all, and transported the grain. In addition, the village government cadres took the lead, cutting wheat early in the morning, carrying water in the morning, and working in the office in the afternoon, harvesting 67 mu of wheat in a week. Under the encouragement, inspiration, and active leadership of the village cadres, the rush harvest situation in Longfeng quickly broke through, and all 3,000 mu of wheat in the village were harvested in twelve days.

　　　　(3) Resolutely Fight.
    On July 15th, an enemy battalion stubbornly attacked Longfeng. Blocking them were three sniper groups. As soon as the shots rang out, militiamen from all directions came to reinforce, joining the battle one after another. After a day of fierce fighting, the enemy suffered six casualties and retreated in panic. On the 17th, the enemy came again. Because the village had paved streets, the enemy took a look and didn't dare to enter, and hurried back. On the 18th, the cunning enemy suddenly attacked Longfeng Village. That day, the "People's Propagandist" - Comrade Ji Laiguan, sounded the alarm, telling the masses to evacuate quickly. After "ringing the alarm," and the masses evacuated the village, he himself did not have time to retreat and heroically sacrificed himself.
    Worker Cheng Long, in defending the summer harvest, made his own plan to earn merit: "To establish the Longfeng Emancipation Second Detachment." First, Cheng Long helped the carpenters manufacture ××××. On July 18th, when the enemy sneaked into Longfeng Village and was about to start looting, Comrade Cheng and others set up the at the Niuwang Temple south of the village. With a deafening sound, shrapnel flew all over the village. The militiamen took the opportunity to shout and cheer, and the enemy was immediately thrown into chaos and retreated in a panic. The Longfeng Village ×××× Second Emancipation Detachment was finally officially born in this battle to defend the summer harvest.

　　人民的龙凤村

    　　　　（一）集体转移与“新山沟生活”。
    介休龙凤村群众的转移，原开始于本年三月群运期间，后来斗争日益尖锐，截至夏收时为止，夜晚转移村外歇宿，已成全村的集体行动。当日落黄昏，你就会听到翻身佃户冀来管（通讯员）一边敲、一边喊着：“把井抽了，把水搬倒，带蒸笼灶，把米面背好（带上）把锹埋了，把辘轳架子和车轮子下了，赶快把你们的粮食藏好，背上你的包包（被褥），今晚到××睡觉！”接着你又会听着：“群众走了，民兵把雷按好，天明时民兵要放好岗哨！”
    看着吧！来管同志的锣声一响，群众便果真背上被窝包包，牵上牲口往指定的地方——新龙凤走去。
    “新龙凤”是一个两旁峭壁陡崖，当间一条羊肠小径的处，地形险要，“一人堵口，万夫莫”，民兵们埋雷、铺草、枪雷结合，不分昼夜地扼守着，尤其是夜晚每逢群众全部入睡后，警戒便格外严密，“勾勾军”想要偷袭突入，是万万办不到的。
    　　　　（二）铺街运动与抢收。
    夏收时期来了，作为介休三区“蜜蜂联防”核心的龙凤村，翻身佃户郭建明发起了铺街运动，他领导民兵把村中大小各各街衢，都铺上麦秆、灰渣，埋上各式各样的雷，虚虚实实、实实虚虚，有的在大道街、有的在门脑上、有的在打场、有的在水”撸????痪浠埃?榈囟际堑乩住?
    六月二十六日，距龙凤二里的南庄村扎下　氨＞?卸印保??徘澜俑浇??村麦子。就在如此紧张战斗的情况下，龙凤群众“一手拿枪、一手拿镰”，开始突击抢收了。
    首先在自愿结合原则下，以冀国宁为首，龙凤出现了第一个七人小型互助组，他们七个人三天内抢收完麦子七十三亩，并全部打完、藏完，还运送了〈畏垂?粮。另外该村政权干部，以身作则，也清早割麦，上午担水，下午办公，一周间抢割麦子六十七亩。在村干部鼓舞、启发、主动组织领导下，龙凤抢收局面迅速突开，十二天全村三千亩麦子全部抢收完毕。
    　　　　（三）坚决战斗。
    七月十五日，敌一个营的兵力硬着头皮进攻龙凤，阻击他们的是三个冷枪组，枪声一响，各路民兵都前来增援，纷纷投入战斗，激战终日，敌死伤六名，仓惶撤退。十七日，敌人又来了，因为村里铺了街，敌人看了看，没敢进村，便匆匆返回。十八日，狡猾的敌人又突然奔袭龙凤村，这天“人民宣传员”——冀来管同志着他的，发出警报叫群众快快转移，在“敲响警钟”，群众纷纷转移出村后，他自己没来得及退出壮烈牺牲了。
    工人程龙，在保卫夏收中订出自己的立功计划：“要成立龙凤翻身二中队。”首先程龙帮忙着木匠制造出××××。七月十八日那天，敌人窜龙凤村，正着手大施抢劫？村南牛王庙上，程同志们架起，天崩地裂一声巨响，铁片子便在村中满街飞舞，民兵乘势呐喊助威，敌人马上混乱，便狼狈撤退。龙凤村××××的第二翻身中队，在此次保卫夏收战斗中，终于正式诞生了。
