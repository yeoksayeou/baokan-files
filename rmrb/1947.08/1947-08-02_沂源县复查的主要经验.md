The Main Experiences of the Yiyuan County Review
Wang Li

(I)	Total liquidation, digging up old roots, a clean sweep of land and floating wealth.

Last year's land reform did not satisfy all the farmers in Yiyuan. The phenomenon of peaceful land surrender was very common. Feudal forces casually took out some land, which actually reduced their burden. Farmers said: "It's just scratching an itch for the feudal forces." Feudal forces still possessed as many as four to seven or eight mu of good land per person, and floating wealth generally remained untouched. Farmers only received a few mu of poor land, and extreme poverty in various villages was not eliminated. Feudal forces not only still had money but also still had power. Some glared at the farmers and said: "You who have turned over are still eating chaff every day. I, who haven't turned over, am still eating meat every market day. All your belongings combined are not worth my jar of 'white-bearded old men' (silver dollars)!"

After the leadership called for a review, farmers in Anping Village and more than ten other villages in Lucun District put forward the slogan of total liquidation with the feudal forces, digging up old roots, and a clean sweep of land and floating wealth, and launched a movement to clear wealth. The struggle was unprecedentedly fierce. All the land of the evil gentry and feudal landlords, regardless of black or white land, good or bad land, vegetable gardens, orchards, houses, regardless of what was placed in the house, buried underground, or hidden in relatives' homes, all agricultural implements, utensils, and property were returned to the farmers. Then, depending on their degree of repentance, the entire peasantry would decide on a portion for their livelihood. The farmers excitedly sang: "This is truly land returning home, houses moving, cattle and sheep returning to their original owners, and the laboring people ruling the world!"

(II)	Checking land starts with checking what's missing, supplementing land until it's even.

"Land is the foundation of everything." The focus of the review is to check and supplement land. As long as land is checked, the obstacles of "no problem" and "no target" are broken, as well as the view that holding one struggle meeting is enough. In the past, the problem with land investigation was looking upward, first looking at how many landlords and rich peasants there were, and first studying their lives. Many were estimates made by cadres like guessing riddles (this review still saw many places repeating this mistake). Anping Village in Lucun District was originally considered "one of the best villages in Yiyuan County's emancipation movement," and it was thought there was "no problem." In the village cadre training class, only a "stubborn" donkey driver was identified as the target for review. However, after proposing to check land by first checking what's missing, the village branch general meeting decided to find those poor peasants who couldn't afford new wheat and couldn't take off their cotton clothes, proposing "eat wheat, take off cotton clothes." It convened meetings of poor peasants to serve as the backbone, mobilizing all the farmers to check for households lacking land. Once they checked, they found them all. The average number of mu per person in the village was 1.7. The average was 1.5 mu, and there were 15 households, 71 people, with only 71 mu of land, less than 1.5 mu per person. According to the principle of "supplementing land until it's even," the result of a thorough liquidation with the feudal forces was that households lacking land all reached the average.

(III)	Each proposes what's lacking, each receives what's needed, filling the gaps and making things even.

In the past, the distribution of fruits was based on the principle of public for the public and private for the private, dividing those who shared the fruits in the entire village into three classes for distribution. Poor peasants were given land, middle peasants were given wealth, and the fruits of struggle, property, and even land were converted into grain, and everyone was given grain according to class. All these methods were inappropriate and disadvantaged the poor and hired peasants (today, there are still many middle peasants in charge of the distribution committee, adopting the above methods). The method of distributing the fruits in Jiuhui and other villages in the mountainous area was to have the farmers thoroughly discuss democratically, each proposing what was lacking, looking from the bottom up and supplementing from the top. The poor and hired peasants lacked the most: land, houses, grain, agricultural implements, livestock, utensils, clothes, etc. They received what they lacked, first the poor then the rich, each receiving what they needed. Middle peasants who individually lacked threshing grounds, vegetable gardens, utensils, etc., could also be given the most urgently needed items under the principle of first the poor then the rich.

(IV)	Politically struggle to put a "tight hoop" on the evil gentry and feudal forces.

In the previous stage of the movement, many evil gentry and feudal forces took advantage of the loopholes in peaceful land surrender. Many still acted like "masters" and "madams" in the villages, "hmphed and hahed" to intimidate the farmers, and spread rumors to undermine the effort. In this review, the farmers of Yiyuan universally demanded political struggle. In the total liquidation, not only economic issues should be cleared, but also political issues, sweeping away the power of the feudal forces. An old farmer in Fengjiagou said to the feudal forces: "The world has changed greatly now. In the past, it wouldn't do if you didn't call me 'Grandpa,' but this year it won't do if you don't call me 'Grandpa' either. You have to call me 'emancipated Grandpa!'" To defeat the power of the feudal forces, the peasants must thoroughly liquidate and expose the crimes of the landlord class. No reason should restrict the peasants' actions to liquidate blood debts, and power must be truly handed over to the peasants. Except for extremely wicked bad elements, who should be suppressed separately, the general landlords and feudal forces must be "controlled" by the peasants after the struggle, and a "tight hoop" must be put on them, so that they cannot escape the palm of the Tathagata (the masses). In Jiuhui Village, the landlords were made to sign a guarantee, listing their own crimes on the guarantee. The peasants elected supervisors and educators to act as guarantors. Small mistakes were educated, and big mistakes were punished, without any leniency. Landlords had to report to the farmers' association when they went to market, visited relatives, left the village, or received guests. An evil tyrant in the village swore to the peasants: "From now on, if I have any second thoughts, shoot me, smash me to death." The peasants asked: "Earlier you spread rumors saying that no one knows who will eat the yellow ears of wheat?" The tyrant said: "Everyone eats!" The peasants said: "If Chiang Kai-shek doesn't invade, we eat, and if he does invade, we still eat. If you change your mind, feel how many heads you have!" Experience has proven that only by truly subjugating the remnants of feudalism can the thinking of changing the world be swept away. In addition, some villages adopted methods such as red and black lists, red and black registration books, and red and black scoreboards to control the landlords. This laid the foundation for mass anti-espionage and consolidating revolutionary order.

(V)	Hired and Poor Peasant Representatives' Congress

The stage of great development of the movement was carried out by adopting large-scale training classes for activists. In this review, many places still used this method. The advantages of this method are: 1. There are bridge-building backbones. 2. Everyone has the same ideas. 3. Action is fast; but there are shortcomings! Cadres are above the peasants, and not many questions are raised from the bottom up. The interests of hired and poor peasants have not been particularly noticed. Therefore, the Yiyuan County Party Committee used the Hired and Poor Peasant Representatives' Congress as the main form of review. Village hired and poor peasant meetings or group meetings were held to fully mobilize all hired and poor peasants as the backbone of the farmers' association, uniting all middle peasants and absorbing middle peasants into the association. Representatives elected by the people held poor and hired peasant representative meetings or peasant congresses to overcome the "bouncing around" phenomenon of a few activists, and to establish the backbone for the township farmers' associations and district farmers' associations while promoting the review. "All power to the peasants" must be given to the farmers' associations led by this established backbone of hired and poor peasants. At the same time, all farmers' associations are being transformed in the review. (Xinhua News Agency)

    沂源县复查的主要经验
    王力
    （一）总清算，刨老根，土地浮财一场清。
    去年土地改革没有满足沂源全体农民的要求，和平献田现象很普遍，封建势力随便拿出一些田来，反而减轻了负担。农民说：“是替封建势力抓痒。”封建势力每口人据有四五亩至七八亩好田的还不少，浮财一般的未动。农民只分到几亩薄地，各村赤贫多未消灭。封建势力不仅仍然有钱而且仍然有势，有的对农民吹胡瞪眼的说：“你们翻身的还不是天天吃糠，我这个没翻身的，还不是每集都吃肉；你们翻身的家当合起来，还抵不上我那罐子的白胡老头哩（银元）”。
    领导上号召复查以后，鲁村区安平庄等十余村农民就提出了和封建势力总清算，刨老根，土地浮财一场清口号，掀起了清财运动。斗争空前激烈，将恶霸封建地主的全部土地，不管黑白地、好、坏地，菜园、果园、房屋，不管屋里放的、地下埋的、外家藏的，一切农具用具财物等全部偿还农民，然后视其悔过程度，再由全体农民作主分别恩赐他一份生活。农民们兴奋地唱着：“这才是土地回老家，房子大搬家，牛羊财物归原主，劳苦农民坐天下”。
    （二）查地先查缺，补地补到平。
    “地是万事本”。复查的中心，是查地补地，只要一查地，就打破了“没问题”和“没对象”的障碍，和开一个斗争会就满足了的看法。过去查田的毛病，是眼皮朝上翻，先看有几户地主富农，先研究他的生活，不少是由干部像猜谜一样的估计（这次复查，仍有不少地方重犯这个毛病）。鲁村区安平庄原认为是“沂源县翻身运动最好村庄之一”，以为“没问题”了。村干训练班上，光确定了一“顽固”赶驴的为复查对象，但提出查地先查缺以后，村支部大会即决定找那些吃不上新麦，脱不下棉袄的贫农，提出：“吃麦子、脱棉袄”，召集贫农会议做骨干，发动全体农民来查缺地户，一查就全部查了出来。全庄平均地亩数，每人一亩七分。平大溜是一亩五分，一亩五分地以下的就有十五户，七十一口人，仅有七十一亩地，按照“补地补到平”原则，向封建势力彻底总清算结果，缺地户都达到了平大溜。
    （三）各提所缺，各分所需，填平补齐。
    过去分配果实，按公归公私归私的原则，把全庄分果实的人分为三等分配，贫农分地，中农分财，和把斗争果实财物以至土地都折成粮食大家按等分粮等办法，都不妥当，都使贫雇农吃亏（今天还有不少中农掌握分配委员会，采取着以上办法）。历山区九会等村分配果实的办法是由农民彻底民主讨论，各提所缺，从下看，往上补，贫雇农缺的最多，土地、房屋、粮食、农具、牲口、用具、衣服等等，缺什么分什么，先贫穷后富裕，各分所需。中农个别缺场园、菜园、用具等，在先穷后富的原则下，也可以分给最迫切需要的东西。
    （四）斗政治给恶霸封建势力戴上“紧箍帽”
    前一阶段运动中，恶霸封建势力很多钻了和平献田的空子，不少在村里仍摆着“大老爷”“大老奶奶”的架子，“哼二哈的吓唬农民，造谣破坏。此次复查沂源农民普遍要求斗政治。总清算中，不仅清经济，而且要清政治，把封建势力的淫威一扫光。冯家沟的老农民对封建势力说：“如今天下大变了，往年不叫你大爷不行，今年你不叫俺大爷也不行，你得叫俺翻身大爷了！”要打垮封建势力的淫威，必须让农民彻底清算揭露地主阶级的罪恶，任何理由不得限制农民清算血债的行动，并且要真正把权力交给农民，除罪大恶极的坏分子，分别予以镇压。一般地主封建势力，在斗争后，农民必须“治”住他，给他戴上一个“紧箍帽”，叫他逃不脱如来佛（群众）的手掌心。九会村让地主立上交保状，在保状上列举自己罪恶。由农民推派监视人和教育人为其作保，犯小错误教育，犯大错处罪，绝不饶恕。地主赶集、走亲戚、出庄门及来客人等，都要向农会报告。该村恶霸向农民宣誓说：“今后若有三心二意，枪毙就枪毙，砸死就砸死。”农民问：“先前你造谣说麦子黄稍不晓得谁吃？”恶霸说：“大伙吃”！农民说：“蒋贼打不来，是俺吃，打来了也是俺吃，你要是变了心，摸摸几个脑袋！”经验证明，真正把封建残余治服，变天思想也就一扫而光了。此外有的村庄农民采红黑榜、红黑登记簿、红黑点板等办法控制地主。这样便打下了群众性的反特及巩固革命秩序的基础。
    （五）雇贫农民代表大会
    运动大发展阶段，是采取大规模积极分子训练班方式开展的，此次复查，不少地方仍用此法。此种方式的好处是：一、有桥梁骨干。二、大家思想一致。三、行动快；但有缺点！干部在农民头上，从下而上提的问题不多。雇贫农的利益没有特别被注意，故沂源县委用雇贫农代表大会，为复查主要形式，村内开雇贫农会议或小组会，充分发动全体雇贫农作为农会的骨干，联合全体中农吸收中农入会，民选代表开贫雇农代表会或农民大会，克服少数积极分子“蹦跳”现象，从推动复查中为乡农会、区农会建立骨干。“一切权力交农民”，必须交给这种树立雇贫为骨干领导的农会，同时一切农会都在复查中改造。  （新华社）
