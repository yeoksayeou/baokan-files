　　Shahe Xinzhang and Other Villages:
　　Mobilizing Women to Weed Seedlings Overcomes Labor Shortages
　　[Our Newspaper, Shahe] The villages of Xinzhang and Hetou in the Fourth District are experiencing labor shortages. In Xinzhang, there are 2,500 mu of young seedlings, but only 160 male laborers in the entire village. Each person can weed 1.5 mu per day, which would take 13 days to complete. There are still over 2,400 mu that need to be weeded two or three times, making it impossible to complete the work. The cadres of the two villages, seizing on the demands of the masses, convened a meeting of mutual aid team leaders to discuss the issue. Han Chunlan, the village head of Hetou, said, "Our village has 105 male laborers and 119 female laborers. If we organize them and have both men and women work in the fields together, we can get the weeding done." After discussion, everyone realized that if they wanted to avoid leaving the land uncultivated, they needed the women to help with the weeding, and the initial weeding would solve the problem. However, some team leaders felt that women were not capable. Zhang Qingshan from Xinzhang said, "I don't support women going to the fields. They can't distinguish between seedlings and weeds. They'll weed the seedlings and leave the weeds. They'll just be undoing the work and weeding everything out." After discussion and ideological work, they also mobilized the women. Han Chunlan, the village head of Hetou, took five or six women to her own land to weed sorghum, teaching them to recognize that the roots of grass are green and the roots of sorghum are yellow. On the first day, they weeded one mu of land. The next day, they mobilized another five or six women, who weeded 1.5 mu of land, doing a very good job. On the third day, women from five groups went to the fields. In Xinzhang, a total of over 500 female labor days were spent over four days, weeding over 790 mu of seedlings, basically completing the first weeding. In Hetou, women also participated in 70 labor days over five days. Seeing the strength of the women, everyone felt that weeding was no longer a problem and became even more motivated. Men and women, young and old, all wanted to contribute to the weeding effort, and a fervent movement to weed the second round of seedlings has now been launched. (Xiaotian)
　　[Our Newspaper Reporter Group, 16th] The over 200,000 mu of late seedlings that were rushed planted after the widespread rains in Shahe County have all emerged. All farmers are now rushing to weed the seedlings. The Fourth District (New District) has mobilized all available labor in the district, paying particular attention to mobilizing women to participate. In the four days of intensive weeding, 558 female laborers participated, weeding a total of 793.8 mu. 722 male laborers participated, weeding a total of 1,585 mu. The second weeding of the late seedlings has already begun. The women of Zhangcun, led by the Han Baini Weaving Mutual Aid Group, have temporarily stopped weaving and are fully engaged in the weeding campaign. Eight people weeded six mu of cotton in one afternoon. The village cadres praised them on the radio that evening. The other weaving groups also went to weed seedlings the next day, unprompted. A labor emulation campaign has been launched in the weeding effort. Fifty-five young and strong women from Baicuo Village have organized ten groups. The groups led by Gao Wei’de, Ji Ceng’s, and Wang Ting’s achieved the best results, weeding quickly, well, and consistently.
　　[Our Newspaper] Wang Yujie, the women's chairman of Beizuo, Yuanshi, organized women to weed seedlings. After mobilization, she first organized nine women, but no one was willing to weed first. So everyone discussed taking turns weeding half a day per household, and after four days, each household had weeded once. Under their influence, another thirty women voluntarily joined, dividing into five groups, and weeding twenty-one mu in one day. In particular, the group led by Wang Yujie worked the most enthusiastically, with nine people weeding eleven mu in one day. Within six days, all the seedlings of their group were weeded. Yujie gets up very early every day, eats breakfast, and leads her group to the field as soon as it gets light. In addition to cooking three meals a day, she also has to grind flour at noon. Her spirit of hard work and endurance is admired by everyone in the village. Under her leadership, the women's enthusiasm for production is growing. Because of the women's lead in mutual aid weeding, many men say, "The women in society are really amazing now. In the past, women didn't go to the fields, but this year one group can weed over a hundred mu."

　　沙河新章等村
  　吸收妇女锄苗克服劳力困难
    【本报沙河讯】四区新章、河头两村，劳力缺乏，新章小苗二千五百亩，全村男劳力一百六十个，每人每天锄地亩半，须十三天才能完成，还有二千四百多亩，还得锄二遍三遍，怎样也锄不过来。两村干部抓住群众要求，召集互助组长开会研究，河头村长韩春兰说：“咱村男劳力一百零五个，妇女劳力就占一百一十九个，组织起来男女齐下地就能锄过来。”经过讨论，大家认识到要想不荒地，就得妇女们帮助锄，头遍苗锄出来就不发愁。但有部分组长嫌妇女不顶事，新章张青山说：“妇女下地我就不赞成，她们苗草不分，锄了苗留下草，头里锄随后跺，长不荒也要锄光。”经讨论打通思想后，又动员了妇女，河头村长韩春兰带着五六个妇女先到自己地去锄黍子，教给妇女认识草根是青的，黍根是黄的，头一天锄了一亩地。第二天又动员出来五六个妇女，一天就锄了一亩半地，锄的很好。第三天五个组的妇女就都上地了。新章共锄了四天，妇女劳力五百余个工，锄苗七百九十余亩，基本上完成了头遍苗。河头五天中，妇女也参加了七十个工。大家看到妇女的力量，都感到锄苗不发愁，就更加劲了。男女不论老少，都要在锄苗中立功劳，现已掀起热烈的锄二遍苗运动。（笑天）
    【本报记者团十六日电】沙河全县普雨后抢种的廿余万亩晚苗，均已出齐，全体农民现正突击锄苗。四区（新区）动员了全区一切劳力，特别注意吸收妇女参加。四天突击锄苗中，参加妇女劳动力有五百五十八个共锄地七百九十三亩八分。参加男劳动力七百廿二个，共锄地一千五百八十五亩，晚苗已开始锄第二遍。章村妇女，在韩白妮纺织互助组带领下，暂时停止纺织，全力投入锄苗运动。八个人一下午锄了六亩棉花，该村干部，晚上在广播台上表扬了她们。其他纺织组第二天也都不约而同的去锄苗，锄苗中开展立功竞赛运动。白错村五十五个青壮妇女，组织了十个小组，参加锄苗的有：高为的、纪层的、王庭的三人领导的小组成绩最好，锄地又快又好又经常。
    【本报讯】元氏北佐妇女主席王玉姐，组织妇女锄苗，经动员即首先组织了九个妇女，但谁也愿意先锄，于是大家商量轮流每户先锄半天，四天后每户都锄过一次。在他们这种影响下又自愿参加了三十个妇女，分了五个小组，一天就锄了二十一亩，特别是王玉姐领导的组干的最起劲，共九个人一天锄了十一亩，在六天内，他组的苗子全部锄完了。玉姐每天起的很早，吃了早饭天方亮，就带领她组的人往地走了，一天做三顿饭外，晌午还得碾面，他这种吃苦耐劳的精神得到全村人的钦佩；在他的领导下，妇女的生产情绪日益高涨。由于妇女的带头互助锄苗，许多男人说：“现在社会上的妇女真了不起了，往年妇女不下地，今年一个组就能锄苗一百多亩。”
