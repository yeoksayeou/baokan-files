　　Cixian Men and Women Work the Fields Together
  　300,000 Mu Complete First Weeding
    [Our newspaper Cixian news] Two-thirds of the county's land was sown for the last time (July 25th). The seedlings emerged all at once, with weeds growing everywhere. If we do not rush to weed, there is a high possibility of the land becoming barren. Based on this situation, the entire county began a full-scale campaign to rush weeding from August 1st. All county-level agencies also stopped working for three days. County Head Wu personally led the effort to help the masses rush weeding. The Tenth District proposed "three no's": no one left at home, not a single weed left in the fields, and not a single mu of barren land left uncultivated, ensuring that all women and children went to the fields. Last year, Xiàjiǎng Village used more than 1,300 short-term laborers for weeding; this year, because all women and children went to the fields, not a single short-term laborer from other villages was used, saving more than 4,000 jin of rice in wages. Weeding also involved men and women challenging each other. Xiàjiǎng Village proposed: "Men and women compete in the drill ground (fields) to compare skills and contributions." Zhang Faxue from Fan Village even drew up a family weeding merit plan and conducted a weeding merit competition with his wife, completing the weeding of all 22 mu of seedlings in five days. Women in Beicheng initially had ideological resistance to going to the fields, thinking, "Now that women are elevated, we are being elevated to the fields." Later, after women's salvation cadre Kong Zhang explained the benefits using an accounting method, pointing out, "Who are you weeding for? How much money can you save by going to the field for a day? How much grain can you harvest?" That same day, 71 women were organized to carry hoes to the fields, influencing the entire village. The next day, more than 130 women organized six mutual aid teams and went to the fields to weed, weeding 132 mu in three days. In this weeding campaign, the Fourth District further leveraged the power of organization. All 43 villages in the district organized 891 teams, with all women and children organized into them. For example, in Nánjièchéng, 17 women and children weeded 72 mu in three days, playing a significant role in the rush weeding. In the weeding campaign in the Fourth District, 70 villages produced 30 female models, especially military dependents, who all proposed not needing substitute labor. For example, Lü Yuzhen and two others, military dependents from Wéiwǔ Village, weeded 7 mu in two days, completely without needing others to do it for them. As of the 17th, the entire county had rushed to weed more than 315,000 mu, basically completing the first weeding. Currently, various places are rectifying mutual aid, preparing to rush the second weeding. (Zhou Nan)

　　磁县男女齐下地
  　卅万亩完成头锄
    【本报磁县讯】全县三分之二土地都是最后一次（七月二十五）下种，小苗一齐出土，杂草丛生，如不突击抢锄，很有荒的可能。根据这一情况，全县即从八月一号开始，全力进行突击锄苗。县级各机关，亦停止办公三天，由武县长亲自带领，帮助群众抢锄。十区提出三不留：家里不留一个人，地里不留一分草，不留一亩荒地，做到妇女儿童全部下地。下蒋村去年锄苗时，用短工一千三百多个工；今年由于妇女儿童全部下地，没有用外村一个短工，把小苗全部锄完，省工资四千多斤米。锄苗中并进行男女挑战，下蒋村提出：“男女下教场（地里）比武比功劳。”范村张法学更订出家庭锄苗立功计划，和他老婆进行锄苗立功比赛，五天即将二十二亩小苗全部锄完。北城妇女开始下地思想不通，认为“现在妇女提高了，把咱提到地里了。”后经妇救干部孔张氏用算帐方法打通思想，提出：“你锄苗是给谁锄的？你上地一天能省多少钱？能打多少粮食？”这样当天即组织起七十一个妇女扛锄下地，影响全村第二天一百三十多个妇女组织起六个互助组，下地锄苗，三天锄苗一百三十二亩。四区在这次锄苗中，更发挥了组织起来的力量，全区四十三个村，组织起八百九十一个组，所有妇女儿童都组织进去。如南界城十七个妇女儿童，三天锄苗七十二亩，对抢锄起了很大作用。四区在锄苗中七十个村即涌现出三十个妇女模范，特别是军属，都纷纷提出不用代耕。如韦武庄军属吕玉珍等三人，二天锄苗七亩，完全不用别人代耕。全县到十七号为止，共突击抢锄三十一万五千多亩，头遍苗基本上完成。现各地正整顿互助，准备抢锄第二遍。（周南）
