　　Ye County Directly Subordinate Organs
  　Select People's Heroes
    [This newspaper's Ye County News] On August 7th, Ye County convened a merit evaluation conference in its stationed location for all cadres and miscellaneous personnel directly under the county organs. Various kinds of People's Heroes have now been selected. For example, Comrade Niu Jinke of the Public Security Bureau, in the ×× battle, Comrade Yang Meisen was injured, so he carried the machine gun and rescued Cai Hao from the line of fire, and then returned to cover the safe withdrawal of the second comrade. Comrade Bai Lianting, the communications squad leader of the county government, is usually very responsible for communications work and cherishes public property very much. During the ×× battle, he rescued Cai Hao in a serious and urgent situation and carried Cai Hao's belongings on his back, comforting Cai Hao, saying, "I would rather die than lose you!" He supported Cai Hao for three or four miles before finding a stretcher. Postal worker Wang Ruyi delivered newspapers and letters back and forth in serious situations, completing his tasks. Once he encountered the enemy, he was able to escape and ensure that the letters were not lost. Guo Ming'an of the bank is active in his work, doing whatever he is asked to do. When encountering the enemy, he carried four to five million in funds on his back without losing a single bit, saying, "If the person is here, the property must be guaranteed to be here, and the public cannot suffer losses." In addition, the work attitudes of administrator Ma Tingxiu, Miao Tiannian of the Industry and Commerce Bureau, and Hou Chunbao of the Public Security Bureau were all unanimously praised. After everyone's merit evaluation, it was unanimously decided to award Comrade Niu Jinke and Bai Lianting each a special-class merit once, Yang Huanyin and Wang Ruyi a major merit twice, and seven others a major merit and nine others a minor merit. Finally, the heroes expressed that they would not be arrogant after making contributions, but would continue to work hard and add merit upon merit; the comrades who had not been awarded merit were all determined to strive for merit, launch a movement for everyone to strive for merit, and learn from the comrades who had made contributions.
