Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 2nd. According to an Associated Press report: The large-scale killing incident between Chiang Kai-shek's military police in Shanghai is still developing. Yesterday (the 1st), a large number of police officers rode in several trucks and held a demonstration parade on important streets, waving flags and shouting, demanding that the Chiang government quickly resolve the case and must "handle it fairly," otherwise they will launch new strikes and large-scale demonstrations. At the same time, about 15,000 regular police officers in Shanghai wore black armbands to mourn the police officers shot by the military police. Currently, Chiang Kai-shek's Shanghai Mayor Wu Guozhen has asked the police bureau to stop this "irresponsible" activity, and Police Chief Yu Shuping is "admonishing" the police officers in some unaffected branches to "await investigation," but several police branches continue to instigate strikes. Currently, most police officers believe that no investigation is necessary to confirm that the conflict was caused by the military police opening fire, but according to a United Press report: Chiang's official side has decided to wait for the American naval military police officer Taylor and two American military police officers who were patrolling the area at the time of the incident to confirm who fired the first shot. According to a Central News Agency report: Chiang Kai-shek has dispatched Qin Dechun, Deputy Minister of his National Defense, to Shanghai to handle this incident.
