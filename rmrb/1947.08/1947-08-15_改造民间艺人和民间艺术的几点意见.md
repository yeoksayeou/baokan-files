Several Suggestions for Remolding Folk Artists and Folk Art
　　Wang Yaping

Remolding folk artists and folk art should be one of the central tasks of our literary and art workers today. Because folk art is an inexhaustible source of literature, folk artists are numerous, and their influence still largely dominates rural culture. The Jilu Yu Cultural Federation has already attached considerable importance to this remolding work and has achieved considerable results. In order to further and universally promote this work in the future, I would like to offer a few suggestions based on my personal experience for everyone's reference:

　　First: Because the vast majority of these folk artists, eight or nine out of ten, are from excellent peasant and worker backgrounds. Therefore, in our revolutionary camp, in the cultural field, we must absorb them in large numbers and unite them. To unite them, we must approach them from the aspects of life and work, and interact with them frequently. Understand them, help them, solve their difficulties for them, find solutions for them, so that they willingly and happily come to our work.

　　Second: To remold artists, we must first remold their thinking. Although their preferences are different—some sing opera, some sing "zhuizi," some tell drum stories; some play the dulcimer, some show magic lanterns, some run shops, some sculpt statues of gods. However, for many years, they have not been valued, they have no social status, and they are full of grievances. When we remold them, we can individually or collectively ask them to pour out their grievances, promote their class consciousness, because if old artists want to turn over, they must first turn over ideologically. We must respect them, encourage them, persuade them, make them understand the principles of turning over, and then mobilize them to embark on the road of thorough transformation together.

　　Third: Once their thinking is transformed, their skills will be easier to transform. Now that the gods in the temples have been overthrown, they can no longer sculpt statues of gods or paint the eighteen levels of hell. They must learn to paint new paintings with realistic significance. Now that the land has returned home and the peasants have turned over, the masses no longer like to listen to old operas with blowing beards and throwing sleeves, and they no longer like to listen to superstitious old lyrics such as "Lord Liu's Private Visit" and "The Case of Bao Gong." They must learn to sing new lyrics, new tunes, and perform realistic dramas and song and dance dramas. Some of the old artists' singing skills, painting skills, and sculpting skills are undesirable and must be transformed; some are good and can be retained and promoted, so that they can be appropriately applied to new content to serve the revolutionary reality.

　　Fourth: From universally uniting them and transforming them, we further improve them. This includes two steps: one is to improve their views, let them know that the old ways don't work anymore, and they must work harder to learn new things, thoroughly transform themselves, and improve themselves. The other is to make them have confidence in their own skills, and also constantly absorb new tunes, new painting methods, new carving methods, and new singing methods, so that their skills can be improved day by day, so that they can not only perform well, but also boldly create. In the process of transforming them, our literary and art workers also transform ourselves. They learn from us, and we also learn from them; they absorb our advantages, and we also absorb their strengths. Work together and create together. The scripts written by the Taihang Rural Drama Troupe, the shadow plays painted by folk artists in Jilu Yu, and the "zhuizi" they compiled have all received good results. If we can further study and create more, there will definitely be better and greater achievements.

　　Fifth: In order to practice the work of transforming folk artists and folk art; our literary and art workers must be close to them, enter them, and establish artists' organizations—such as rural drama troupes, sculpture improvement associations, and artist propaganda teams. Constantly research and collect various folk art materials, create, print, and publish a large amount. Take the created works to sing and practice at district and county conscription meetings, election meetings, hero meetings, and other mass gatherings. From practice and singing, we can further improve, recreate, recreate, and improve again. To achieve the purpose of serving the workers, peasants and soldiers.

　　The peasants have turned over, the patriotic self-defense war is winning victory after victory, and the workers, peasants and soldiers are eagerly demanding to express them, praise them, and demand art that they can read, see, and hear. Folk artists are a powerful force, and folk art is an inexhaustible literary treasure, therefore, I suggest that literary and art authors should universally attach importance to it and quickly and widely carry out this work!

　　改造民间艺人和民间艺术的几点意见
    王亚平
    改造民间艺人和民间艺术，在今天，应该是我们文艺工作者中心工作之一。因为，民间艺术是吸取不尽的文学源泉，民间艺人的数目很多，他们的力量还大部分地支配着农村文化。这种改造工作，在冀鲁豫文联已给予相当重视，而且收到了相当的效果。今后为了进一步普遍地开展这一工作，特根据个人经验，提出几点意见以供大家参考：
    第一：因为这些广大的民间艺人，十之八九都是优秀的农民、工人出身。所以在我们革命阵营里，在文化事业上，必须大量地吸收他们，团结他们。要团结他们，就要从生活上，工作上，和他们接近，常常往来。了解他们，帮助他们，替他们解决困难，替他们想出路，使他们自愿而欢喜地到我们工作里来。
    第二：改造艺人，要先改造他们的思想。虽说他们所爱好的不一样，有的唱戏，唱坠子，说鼓书；有的打洋琴，拉洋片，开店，塑神像。可是，他们多少年来，都不被人重视，没有社会地位，装了一肚子苦水。咱们改造他们，就可以个别的或集体的，叫他们倒苦水，促起他们的阶级觉悟，因为旧艺人要翻身，首先一定要从思想上翻身做起。咱们要尊重他们，鼓励他们，说服他们，使他们明白了翻身的道理，再动员他们一齐走向彻底改造的道路。
    第三：思想改造了，他们的技术也就容易改造。庙神打倒了，他们不能再塑神像、画十八层地狱，他们一定要学习描画有现实意义的新画，土地回家了，农民翻身了，群众不欢喜再听吹胡子、摔袖子的旧戏，不欢喜再听“刘大人私访”“包公案”那些迷信的旧词了，他们一定要学唱新词，新调，学演现实戏，歌舞戏。旧艺人的唱技、画技、塑技，有些是要不得的，就得改造它；有些是好的，就可以保留它，发扬它，使他们适合地运用到新内容里来，为革命的现实服务。
    第四：由普遍地团结他们，改造他们，再进一步提高他们。这里包括两个步骤：一个是提高他们的看法，叫他们知道老一套吃不开了，要加油学习新的，澈底改造自己，提高自己。一个是使他们对自己的技术要有自信，还要不断地吸收新调，新画法，新雕法，新唱法，使自己的技术一天一天地改进，不但自己能够很好的表现，而且能够大胆地创造。咱们文艺工作者在改造他们当中，也改造了自己。他们向咱学习，咱也向他们学习；他们吸收咱的优点，咱也吸取他们的长处。一同努力，一同创造。太行农村剧团写的剧本，冀鲁豫的民间艺人画的洋片，编的坠子，都收到了很好的效果，若果能进一步多研究，多创造，那一定有更好更大的成绩。
    第五：为了实践改造民间艺人和民间艺术工作；咱们文艺工作者必须亲近他们，走进他们当中，建立艺人组织，——如农村剧团、雕塑改进会、艺人宣传队等。不断地研究，搜集各种民间艺术材料，大量地创作，印刷，出版。把创造出来的作品，借着区县参军大会，选举大会，群英大会，及其他群众集合的机会，去演唱，去实习。由实习，演唱中，再提高，再创造，再创造，再提高。达到为工农兵大众服务的目的。
    农民翻身了，爱国自卫战争节节地胜利，工农兵大众如饥似渴地要求表现他们，歌颂他们，要求能读，能看，能听的艺术。民间艺人是一股有力的队伍，民间艺术是一个掘发不完的文学宝库，因此，我建议文艺文作者应普遍地重视它，迅速而广泛地开展这一工作！
