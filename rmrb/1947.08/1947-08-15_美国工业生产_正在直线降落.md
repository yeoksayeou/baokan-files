　　U.S. Industrial Production
  　Is Plummeting
    Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 9th: Washington dispatch: Official statistics show that U.S. industrial production has passed its peak and is declining along a straight line. According to a dispatch from the U.S. Information Service on the 6th: The U.S. Federal Reserve Board recently announced in its published monthly business review that if the average industrial production index of the United States from 1935 to 1939 is taken as 100, then the peak of the post-war industrial production index was this March, reaching 190; it decreased to 186 in April. It decreased to 185 in May and 183 in June. The dispatch also stated: "According to the Bureau, a further reduction has been found in July." On the other hand, regardless of the fact that high prices will further shrink the domestic market, monopoly capital continues to raise prices, greedily hoping to obtain more temporary profits. Recently, the steel, coal, and automobile industries have sharply increased prices, and the prices of various Packard cars have generally increased by $92 to $200.
    Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 11th: According to an Associated Press dispatch on the 8th: Figures released by the U.S. Automobile Industry Statistics Office show that U.S. automobile production has sharply declined. More than 95,000 vehicles were produced last week, but this week it has dropped to more than 78,000 vehicles. According to the U.S. Information Service in early July, it boasted that U.S. automobile production reached 100,000 vehicles per week.

　　美国工业生产
  　正在直线降落
    【新华社陕北九日电】华盛顿讯：官方统计显示美国工业生产已越过顶峰，且有沿一条直线下降之势。据美国新闻处六日电：美联邦准备局顷在其发表之每月商情概览中宣布，若以一九三五至三九年美国之工业生产平均指数为一百，则战后工业生产指数之最高峰为今年三月，达到一九○；四月份即减至一八六。五月份减至一八五，六月份减至一八三。该电又称：“据该局宣称，七月份已发现有更进一步之减低。”另一方面，独占资本不顾物价保贵将更为缩小国内市场的事实，继续提高物价，贪婪地希望获得更多的暂时利润。最近钢铁业、煤业、汽车业又急剧提高物价，白卡德公司之各种汽车普遍加价九十二美元至二百美元不等。
    【新华社陕北十一日电】据美联社八日电：美汽车业统计处所发表之数字显示，美汽车生产已尖锐下降。上周生产九万五千余辆，本周则降至七万八千余辆。按七月初美新闻处曾吹嘘美国汽车每周达十万辆。
