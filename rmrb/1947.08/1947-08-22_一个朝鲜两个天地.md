　　Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 20th: Pyongyang dispatch: On August 15th, the people of northern Korea warmly celebrated the second anniversary of liberation and supported all the democratic reforms of the government over the past two years. To date, North Korea has implemented a thorough land reform, permanently abolishing feudal exploitation. 725,000 landless and poor farmers, accounting for 72% of all farmers in North Korea, have received 1.3 million hectares of land (approximately 16 mu per hectare) from the Japanese and landlords without compensation. The electrification of farms and the construction of rural culture are also actively underway. The Labor Law promulgated by the People's Committee stipulates that adults work eight hours, and young people work six hours. Adult workers and members receive two weeks of vacation per year, while young people receive one month. Factories and institutions have implemented mandatory social insurance and safety measures. The people of North Korea live a free political life, and every citizen who has reached the age of twenty enjoys the right to vote and be elected. Last November, elections were held for the provincial, county, and district People's Committees, and in February of this year, elections were held for the township People's Committees. In March, elections were also held for the village People's Committees. 55,456 farmers, 8,697 workers, and 129 intellectuals have been elected to People's Committees at all levels. Former landlords and industrialists also have the opportunity to participate in the government.
　　But in South Korea, it is a clear contrast between paradise and hell compared to North Korea. Land reform has not yet been implemented, and 80% of farmers have no land or lack land. Heavy taxes and levies make life unbearable. Workers actually work more than eight hours, have no medical expenses, and live a dark and terrifying political life. Syngman Rhee and other reactionaries, with American support, are doing their utmost to trample on democracy and freedom. Democratic people are often arrested and shot. Recently, the American military government has arrested more than 2,000 people, and even issued a ban on any gatherings by political parties on "August 15th" to commemorate the second anniversary of liberation. On August 12th, it openly closed the meeting places of democratic political groups such as the Democratic People's Front, the Farmers' Association, the Laboring People's Party, and the Women's Federation. Many democratic newspapers were also surrounded by the police on the 16th and could not be published, and a large number of editors and reporters were arrested.
　　Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 19th: Pyongyang dispatch: The chairman of the US military government in South Korea, Lerch, is now preparing to organize a South Korean puppet government, which will be established as soon as the work of the Soviet-American Joint Commission is suspended. The candidates for this government have already been internally determined, and are composed of extreme reactionaries. The president will be Syngman Rhee, and the premier will be Chiang Tao-su, the deputy leader of the so-called "Democratic Party" (traitor party). The cabinet list will include anti-Soviet and anti-communist elements such as Kim Ku and Kim Kyu-sik. The US military government in South Korea is arresting democratic parties and progressives in large numbers. 2,000 people were arrested on the night of the 12th, and the various organizations of the Democratic People's Front have begun to be destroyed. According to reliable sources, the American representative to the Joint Commission is arranging various obstacles to the current discussion of various issues, in an attempt to undermine the work of the Commission.
