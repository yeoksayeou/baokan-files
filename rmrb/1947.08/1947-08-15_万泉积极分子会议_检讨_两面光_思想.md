　　Wanquan Activist Conference
  　Self-Criticism of "Two-Faced" Ideology
    [This newspaper, Taiyue, 13th dispatch] At the Wanquan conference of over 400 activists, due to the preliminary resolution of "changing the heavens" ideology, the "two-faced" attitude was examined. An activist from Zhanghu Village said: "Some time ago, when struggling against the landlord, I hid in the wheat straw and didn't say a word, thinking: if the Second War Zone comes back, I haven't offended anyone, it's none of my business." Huang Fengjin from He Village said: "When struggling against the landlord Huang Changsheng, I was afraid of the change of heavens and offending people, so I secretly tipped off the landlord, letting the landlord know I was a good person." An old farmer from Zhanghu Village said: "The liberation team asked me to be a land reform committee member, I was very afraid, and my wife resented me, but I also wanted to turn over, so I thought of two ways: First, when struggling, only raise small opinions, not harming the landlord, such as when struggling against Xue Ziliang, I only mentioned picking wheat in his field, and his child didn't allow it. Second, secretly give away what was openly received. When distributing the fruits of the struggle against Xue Ziliang, I sealed up everything I received and told the landlord: it will still be yours in the future. Having attended the meeting for a few days, I feel very uncomfortable. Having done such things that lose my duty, people in other villages struggled against landlords and gained so much land and silver, but our village's struggle was all fake. The masses scold us as lackeys, the landlords say we are bad people, and the liberation team says we are not loyal, and the result is suffering from all sides. From now on, I must be a good person for the poor." Old Deng from Nanhe Village stood up and swore: "I, this old man, have lived for most of my life, how long will I have to suffer? Today I want to say a word in front of everyone, if I ever act two-faced again, I am a bastard, and I will lead everyone to fight to the end." In the meeting, everyone spoke one after another, all determined to go back and resolutely separate from the landlords and thoroughly struggle against feudalism.

　　万泉积极分子会议
  　检讨“两面光”思想
    【本报太岳十三日电】万泉四百余积极分子大会上，由于初步解除了“变天”思想，检讨出了“两面光”态度。张户村一位积极分子说：“前些时候斗争地主时，我钻在麦秸堆里不哼气，心里想：二战区再来，咱没惹下人，没咱的事。”和村黄丰谨说：“斗争地主黄长生时，我怕变了天，惹下人，便暗中给地主通风报信，叫地主知道我是好人。”张户村一位老农说：“翻身队叫我当土改委员，心里很怕，老婆又怨恨我，可是心里也想翻身，于是便想了两个办法：一是斗争时只提小意见，不伤害地主，如斗争薛子良时，我只提了到他地里去拾麦，他娃娃不叫。二是分果实明受暗送，分配斗争薛子良的果实时，我将得来的东西原盘封好，告诉地主说：将来还是你的。此次开了几天会，心里非常难受。干了这样失掉本份的事，人家村里斗争了地主多少土地和元宝，咱村都是假斗争，群众骂咱是狗腿，地主说咱是坏人，翻身队说咱不忠诚，结果是三面受气。从今以后，我一定要当个穷人的好人。”南和村老邓站起来宣誓说：“我老汉活了多半辈子了，苦还要受到何时？今天我要在大家面前说一句，以后我再当两面光，就是杂种，非领导大家斗透底不行。”会中你一言我一语，都决心回去和地主坚决分家，彻底斗透封建。
