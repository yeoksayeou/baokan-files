Beiping News: On the 15th of last month, the anniversary of the assassination of the famous democrat and former Southwest Associated University professor Wen Yiduo by Chiang Kai-shek's secret agents, the New Poetry Society, Fengyu Society, and Literary Society of Peking University, along with twenty-two other organizations and friends of Wen Yiduo, held a solemn memorial evening at the Democracy Square of Peking University at 7 p.m. More than 1,500 students from Peking University, Tsinghua University, Yanjing University, as well as people from outside the university and foreign journalists attended. A portrait of Wen Yiduo was hung high at the venue, his eyes bright and full of integrity, showing his fearless spirit in fighting against the counter-revolutionaries during his lifetime.

At the beginning of the meeting, the "Sand Beach Choir" softly sang "Sleep, Warrior!" followed by a three-minute silence from the entire audience. Then, Wen Lihe, the eldest son of Wen Yiduo, who was seriously injured in the assassination last year, reported on the brutality of Chiang's agents and the heroic sacrifice of Wen Yiduo based on his own experience, which brought tears to the eyes of the entire audience. After the report, the New Poetry Society recited elegies, and professors such as Xu Deheng and Feng Zhi were invited to speak about Wen Yiduo's life. The solemn venue was filled with a tragic mood of settling the crime of murder and avenging Wen Yiduo. On the same day, Wen Yiduo's life's works, speeches, and photos were exhibited, and Wen Yiduo's blood-stained clothes from the assassination last year were displayed, attracting more than 7,000 visitors. Donations were also collected on the spot for Wen Yiduo's family, and the donors were very enthusiastic. (Xinhua News Agency, Jin-Cha-Ji Dispatch)
