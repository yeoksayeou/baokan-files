Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 13th. According to a Reuters dispatch from Nanjing on the 10th: The Chiang government is actively preparing for the sham elections of the "National Assembly" and "Legislative Yuan" of China (according to the Chiang government's regulations, October 21st to 23rd are the dates for the sham election of "National Assembly Representatives," December 21st to 23rd are the dates for the sham election of "Legislative Yuan Members," and July 23rd to August 26th and October 22nd to November 20th are the respective registration dates for the two sham election voters), which has begun with a lively dogfight. The Kuomintang's political beggar parties, the Youth Party and the Democratic Socialist Party, have already "engaged in fierce debate" over the seats in the sham election, which is still three or four months away. Reuters reported that the Youth Party and the Democratic Socialist Party, which are weak in terms of party members and organization, have suggested to the Kuomintang that the election should be conducted according to the "three, one, one, one system," that is, the Kuomintang would get three seats, and the two minor parties, the Youth Party and the Democratic Socialist Party, and non-partisans (that is, the so-called "social elites" in the Chiang government) would each get one seat. The Kuomintang opposes this provision. The two minor parties fear that without this system, they will not get any seats. Only when the Kuomintang says like a father, "Okay, we'll let you have this position," can they get a position. Reuters' report shows how farcical the upcoming sham election will be. Reuters said that this matter has been ridiculed by people of integrity, and Civil Affairs Spokesperson Luo Longji pointed out sharply: "The election will be 'monopolized by one party,' and the two minor parties, the Youth Party and the Democratic Socialist Party, will 'share some leftover scraps of ready-made buns.'" Reuters reported that Kuomintang Interior Minister and Chairman of the "Election General Office," Zhang Lisheng, told reporters on the 10th that the "general election," which will be held during the civil war, will "test the democratic spirit of the people of this country," but the citizens of China (Chiang-controlled areas) do not yet know that they only have ten days left to register to vote, and they are not even clear about the registration procedures. Passersby on Zhongshan Road, the main street in Nanjing, said: "I don't know anything about their election." Rickshaw pullers said: "We are coolies. The Baojia chief will take care of the election for us as usual."

　　蒋政府积极筹办伪选
  　狗打架热闹场面开始
    【新华社陕北十三日电】据路透社南京十日消息：蒋政府积极筹办中国之“国大”及“立法院”伪选（按蒋政府规定十月二十一日至二十三日为“国大代表”伪选日期，十二月二十一日至二十三日为“立法委员”伪选日期，七月二十三日至八月二十六日及十月二十二日至十一月二十日为两个伪选选民分别登记日期），已以狗打架的热闹场面揭开序幕。国民党的政治乞丐青年党、民社党已为尚距三四个月的伪选中的席位问题“发生剧烈争辩”。路透社称：党徒与组织都弱的青年党与民社党曾向国民党建议依“三、一、一、一制”办法进行选举，即国民党为得三席，民青二党及无党派人士（即蒋政府中所谓“社会贤达”一流）各得一席。国民党反对这种规定。民青二党害怕没有这个制度，他们就会得不到席位。只有当国民党老子似地说：“好，我们让你有这个位置”，他们才能得到职位。路透社的报导显示了行将到来的伪选将是一出多么滑稽的丑剧。路透社称：此事已遭到正义人士之斥笑，民政发言人罗隆基氏尖刻指出：“选举将是‘由一党垄断’，而由民青二党”，“分得一些现成包子的残片余屑”。路透社称：国民党内政部长兼“选举总事务所”主委张厉生十日招待记者时说，行将于内战中举行的“大选”，将要“考验这个国家国民的民主精神”，但是中国（蒋管区）的市民却还不晓得他们只剩下十多天的时间可登记选举了，而且连登记程序也不了然。南京主要街道中山路的过路人说：“他们选举的事我一点都不知道。”人力车夫说：“我们是苦力。选举的事，保甲长会照例代替我们做的。”
