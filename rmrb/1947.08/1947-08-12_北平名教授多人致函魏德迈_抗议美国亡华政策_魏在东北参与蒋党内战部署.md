　　Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 10th: A Shanghai newspaper reports that many prominent professors from universities such as Tsinghua, Yenching, and Peking in Beiping, sent a letter to Wedemeyer, exposing the fascist nature of the Chiang government and opposing the US imperialists' policy of continuing to aid Chiang in the civil war, which would effectively destroy China. Among the documents, letters, and opinions that Wedemeyer brought back from his trip to Beiping, was a statement from several prominent professors to Wedemeyer, which stated: "The only country (the United States) that supports the current (Chiang) government in carrying out a civil war against the will of the people will be treated with hatred by the Chinese people. The only country (the United States) that places China's internal affairs under its direct control will arouse the indignation of the people of the world!" The statement condemned the Kuomintang government for undermining democratic principles, citing the arrest of thousands of students, professors, reporters, and lawyers in anti-civil war demonstrations as powerful evidence.

　　Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 9th: When Wedemeyer arrived in Fushun, an important coal mining center, on the 6th from Shenyang for an "inspection", Chiang Kai-shek's servants treated their foreign master as Japanese subjects would receive the Japanese Emperor on an "inspection tour." All residents of the city were forced to hang flags, and Chiang Kai-shek's special agents and some bought-off hooligans, dressed in plain clothes as "the people," held Chinese and American flags, "cheering along the road." Kuomintang civil and military officials followed behind, fawning and shouting, in an utterly disgraceful manner. In other news, after Chen Cheng, one of the ringleaders of the civil war and Chief of Staff of the Kuomintang, hurriedly followed Wedemeyer to Shenyang, according to an Associated Press report, Wedemeyer held a military conference with Chen. This shows that Wedemeyer has directly participated in the Kuomintang's civil war military deployment in the Northeast. It is also reported that Wedemeyer arrived in Qingdao on the 7th and Jinan on the 8th, where he stayed for four hours and "held talks" with Wang Yaowu, director of the Second Pacification Zone and commander of the Kuomintang's civil war in Shandong, before flying back to Nanjing. In Qingdao, Wedemeyer visited the naval school jointly run by Chiang and the US, observing a live-fire exercise, and Wedemeyer "expressed his deep appreciation" for the technical operations that the school's students were preparing to use to slaughter the Chinese people. He also "exchanged views at length" with Chen Yili, director of the Qingdao Port Engineering Bureau, on port and dock issues. It is said that Wedemeyer will go to Taiwan on the 11th and then to Guangzhou for a "inspection" of southern China.

    【新华社陕北十日电】沪报讯：北平清华、燕京、北京等大学名教授多人，曾致函魏德迈，揭露蒋政府法西斯本质，反对美帝国主义者继续援蒋内战实际灭亡中国的帝国主义政策。魏德迈北平之行携回的文件、信件与意见书中，内有名教授多人致魏氏声明书一件，声明书内略称：“支持现（蒋）政府进行违反民意的内战的独一无二的国家（美国），将被中国人民以仇恨相待。置中国内政于其直接控制之下的独一无二的国家（美国），将引起世界人民的愤慨！”声明书谴责国民党政府破坏民主原则，提出在反内战游行中数千学生、教授、记者、律师被捕作为有力证据。
    【新华社陕北九日电】当魏德迈六日由沈阳抵重要煤矿中心抚顺“访问”时，蒋介石的臣仆们竟象日本臣民接待日本天皇“出巡”一样地接待其外国主子。全城居民被强迫悬旗，蒋介石特务和被收买的一些流氓，穿着便衣装成“民众”，手持中美国旗“夹道欢呼”，国民党文武百官随后跟着，献媚叫闹，丑态百出。另讯：当内战头子之一国民党参谋总长陈诚随魏德迈之后匆忙赶赴沈阳后，据美联社消息，魏曾与陈举行军事会议。此事显示魏已直接参与东北国民党内战军事布署。另悉魏德迈七日抵青岛，八日抵济南，在济停留四小时与国民党山东内战指挥者第二绥靖区主任王耀武等“接谈”后，飞返南京。魏氏在青岛曾参观蒋美合办之海军学校炮火演习，魏氏对该校学员准备用以屠杀中国人民之技术作业“深表赞许”。与青岛港工程局长陈夷履对港口码头问题“交换意见甚久”。据称：魏将于十一日赴台湾再转广州，作中国南部之“视察”。
