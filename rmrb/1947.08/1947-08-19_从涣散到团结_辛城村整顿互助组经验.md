From Dispersal to Unity
Xin City Village's Experience in Rectifying Mutual Aid Teams
Zhao Zihou
Insufficient Understanding Led to Detours
Xin City Village in Neiqiu County has a total of 175 households. When mutual aid teams were first organized, with the exception of two elderly and widowed households, 173 households participated. As a result, the leading cadres believed that organizing production was much easier than land reform, and they developed the idea that they "could relax a bit." Consequently, they relaxed their in-depth education and consolidation work on mutual aid, which led the mutual aid teams down a winding path. Firstly, regarding the reasons for participating in mutual aid, the cadres said: With mutual aid, there would be no problem with providing land cultivation for military and government families, and there would be no problem with cultivating land for people without labor. They considered mutual aid to be organized for the purpose of providing land cultivation. Some of the masses (mostly middle peasants) said: "Everyone else is participating, if we don't participate, people will say we are backward." Therefore, they also participated. Some of the masses said: "The Communist Party and Chairman Mao are working for the benefit of the people, and nothing he says will be bad. Let's do it" (poor peasant activists). However, it was not clear at the time exactly how it would be beneficial. Some also said: "We can't disobey orders from above." In short, at that time, not enough effort was made to raise the consciousness of the masses, grasp their demands, and allow them to consciously organize themselves. Secondly, due to poor education, insufficient consciousness among the masses, and a lack of practical experience, many problems arose during the process of implementation. The main problems were the following two:
	1.	The Issue of Equivalent Exchange: At the beginning, the issues of converting work, recording work, and wages were not well researched. It was stipulated that work would be exchanged for work, and there was no plan. Whoever needed people would ask the team leader to send them. The team leader only acted as a foreman, and if he could do the work himself, he would not look for anyone else. At that time, mutual aid was nominal. Later, there were regulations, but it was impossible to break through the personal relationships. They were all neighbors, friends, and relatives. Who would care about small discrepancies? They showed "tolerance," but were dissatisfied internally. If they had opinions, they didn't express them, and slowly they stopped cooperating. At that time, out of the 21 mutual aid teams in the village, only the three teams of Zhang San, Zhang Nian, and Zhang Guiliang implemented work recording and used work points. The other 18 teams were half-dead, and all had problems of unfairness. On the surface, it looked good, such as providing land cultivation for military families (through mutual aid), especially for elderly and widowed people. Everyone was not very willing, but on the surface, they said that they should emphasize unity, otherwise people would say they were backward. Zhang Zhibian said: "What is the point of worrying about loss or gain among our own brothers? Unity is the most important thing." These sentimental ideas, in particular, affected women's participation in mutual aid. The women in Zhang San's team, regardless of how much work they did, were uniformly assigned half a labor point, which lowered the women's enthusiasm. Zhang Chen's team did not give women any points at all, and the women's enthusiasm was even lower. Later, when it didn't rain, no one used labor anymore, fearing wage expenses. They all said that storing grain was more secure than using labor, which was also a reason why mutual aid could not be carried out well.
	2.	The Leadership Style of Team Leaders: The leadership style of the team leaders had a significant impact on mutual aid. If some team leaders were irresponsible and selfish, the team would not function well. For example, when team leader Mao Xihe was rushing to plant, he planned everything well the night before and divided the work. The next morning, he and his wife and children led the cattle and carried the seed drill to plant their own land, which affected the whole team's rush to plant. Team leader Mao Changfu was not good at planning work, and rushing to plant wasted a lot of labor. Everyone had complaints. There were also individual teams that were selfish, but the team members did not dare to express their opinions, saying: "He is the team leader, we don't dare to make trouble with him," which also affected the consolidation of the mutual aid team.

Several Experiences in Rectifying Mutual Aid
	1.	Summarize Typical Experiences to Raise the Consciousness of the Masses to Organize. Although there were many problems in the mutual aid teams, it was very important to seize the good aspects and commend and promote them. The rectification of mutual aid in Xin City started from this aspect. After the harvest, model workers were elected by the masses, and experiences were summarized. A total of 26 labor models were selected in the village, 19 men and 7 women. Through this election, both the masses and the cadres recognized that Zhang Guiliang and the three teams of Zhang San and Zhang Nian were doing well. They implemented strict equivalent exchange, and the division of labor was also very good. The team members greatly benefited. When rushing to plant, other teams completed planting in four days, while their team completed it in two and a half days. The equivalent exchange in the team was well done, and no one had any objections, so they were very united. After the evaluation, both cadres and the masses had a desire to reform mutual aid. Grasping this demand, the first step was to clarify the importance of rectifying mutual aid among the cadres, discuss the direction of development, and discuss the rectification plan. Among the masses, model workers were publicized, the influence of model workers was expanded, and combined with their own interests, the idea of "mutual aid for oneself" was gradually clarified.
	2.	Liquidating Past Accounts: Everyone already had the desire to do a good job in mutual aid, so they began to organize. First, they strictly cleaned up the accounts of the past stage, then asked everyone to recall what shortcomings there were in mutual aid and how to do it well, so that the masses could express their true thoughts and break the untrue ideas such as "It doesn't matter if you suffer a loss or gain an advantage." The slogan was "Suffering losses and gaining advantages should be clear," inspiring everyone to seriously review. After breaking through personal relationships, the team members actively raised their opinions. For example, Zhang Dachun and Meng Misu (women) said: "Our team is different from others. Others have planted all their land, but we can't plant ours. We want to contribute labor to others for mutual aid but we don't have the opportunity. What will we eat if we don't harvest grain?" Many teams proposed: The team leader did not lead well himself, and the evaluation of work was unfair, and livestock were not adjusted. The women proposed that some people looked down on women, etc. Many people proposed to switch teams. After this review, it can be seen that the masses had a mutual aid consciousness and actively demanded to do a good job in mutual aid.
	3.	Dissolve and Reorganize. The cadres saw that the masses were not discouraged and only said that mutual aid could meet the wishes of the masses, so they dared to let go boldly, truly voluntarily. The original organization was dissolved and then reorganized. The production committee member called on those who had done well in the past to stay together, and those who did not get along well could switch teams. If the team leader was not good, he could be replaced. After the announcement, the masses were asked to deliberate and consider, and then re-establish the organization on a conscious basis. After the reorganization, 24 teams were formed, an increase of 3 teams and 6 team leaders. Two of the original team leaders were also replaced.

The Situation After Rectification
After the rectification, the 24 teams all had better rules and regulations, and mutual aid hoeing became more active.
	1.	Hold more review meetings, discuss and solve problems anytime and anywhere. 2. Resolutely implement points based on work and piecework, increasing points for good work and decreasing points for bad work, and exchanging work points every day. Wages are increased or decreased according to the season. 3. Work should be planned. The work for the next day should be arranged the day before. 4. Review and settle accounts every five to ten days. 5. Zhang Guiliang's team stipulated that labor in the field should be exchanged for work done at home, such as men hoeing the field for a day, and women spinning four taels of cotton, all counting as ten points. There are also regulations for weaving cloth and making shoe soles. Their slogan: Lay a solid foundation, calculate accounts diligently, review frequently, plan work well, and be fair in assigning points.

　　从涣散到团结
  　辛城村整顿互助组经验
    赵子厚
    认识不足走了弯路
    内邱辛城村共一百七十五户，开始组织互助组时，一号召除两户孤寡外，有一百七十三户参加，以是领导干部认为搞生产比土地改革容易的多，产生了“可以松口气”的想法，因而放松了深入教育巩固互助的工作，致使互助组走了弯路。首先从为什么参加互助来说，干部说：有了互助给军、干属代耕不成问题了，给没有劳力人种地也不成问题了。把互助认为是为代耕而组织的。有些群众说（老中农多）：都参加了咱不参加叫人家说咱落后。因此也参加了。有些群众说：“共产党毛主席为人民谋利，他说出来的就没有坏事，干吧（贫农积极分子）。但究竟怎样有利，当时是不明确的。也有说：上级公事咱能不办。总之当时对提高群众组织觉悟，掌握他们的要求，让他们自觉的组织起来，作的不够。其次由于教育差，群众觉悟不够，也缺乏具体经验，因此在干的过程中也出了好多问题，主要的有以下两个：
    １、等价交换问题：开始对折工、记工、工资等问题没有好好研究，规定工换工往前干，也没有计划，谁用着人了叫组长派，组长只起工头作用，自己能干的就不找人了，当时互助是有名无实。以后有了规定，但情面打不破，都是邻居朋友和亲戚，差一错二谁还那么见小，表现“涵厚”，但内心不满意，有了意见不提，慢慢就不互助了。当时全村廿一个互助组，执行记工使用工票的只有张三、张年、张贵良三个组，其他十八个组都是半死不活的，都存在着不公平问题。从表面上看到很好，如给军属代耕（以互助组），尤其是给孤寡种地，大家本来不很自愿，可是表面上说，应当讲团结，不然叫人家说落后。张志便说：“自家兄弟有什么吃亏、沾光，团结就是了。”这些情面思想，尤其影响妇女们参加互助，张三组的妇女不管做活多少，一律按半劳力订分，结果降低了妇女情绪，张辰组根本没有给妇女顶过分，妇女情绪更低。再以后天不下雨，谁也不用工了，怕出工资，都说用工不如存粮保险，也是互助不能搞好的原因。
    ２、组长的领导作风问题：小组长的领导作风，对于互助的关系很大，有些组长不负责任、自私，组就搞不好。如组长毛喜河突击抢种时，头一天晚上计划的很好，也分了工。第二天早晨他和他的老婆孩子牵上牛扛上耧种自己的了，影响了全组的抢种。组长毛长福不会计划活，抢种浪费很多劳力，大家都有怨言，还有个别组也是自私，但是组员们不敢提意见，说：“人家是组长，咱不敢给人家闹”，也影响到互助组的巩固。
　　整顿互助的几点经验
    １、总结典型经验，提高群众组织起来的觉悟。选举模范，总结经验，互助组虽存在着不少问题，但抓住好的一面，加以表扬推广是很重要，辛城整顿互助是先从这一面下手的。抢了以后，经群众选举模范，总结经验，全村共选出二十六个劳动模范，男的十九个，女的七个。经这个选举，群众和干部都认识张贵良和张三、张年三个组搞的好，他们执行了严格的等价交换，劳力分工也很好，组员们大大沾了光。抢种时别的组四天完成下种，他们组两天半就完成了，组里等价交换搞的好，谁也没有意见，因此很团结。经过评选，干部和群众都有了改造互助的要求，抓住这个要求，首先在干部中把整顿互助的重要明显起来，并讨论发展方向，讨论整顿计划。在群众中宣传模范，扩大模范影响，结合自己利益，把“互助为自己”思想逐渐明确起来。
    ２、清算过去帐目：大家已有了把互助搞好的要求，开始整理，首先严格清理过去一阶段的帐目，接着就让大家回想互助中还有什么缺点，怎样才能搞好，使群众发挥真实思想，打破“吃亏沾光没有啥”等不真实思想，口号是“吃亏沾光到明处”，启发大家认真的检讨。打破情面以后，组员们积极提了意见，如张大春、孟密素（妇女）说：“俺这组给别人不一样，别人地都种上了，俺种不上，想给别人互助出劳力没有机会，打不下粮食吃什么？”许多组提出：组长不好好领导自己，工评与不公，牲口没有调剂开。妇女们提出有人小看妇女等，很多人提出跳组。经过这次的检讨，可以看出来群众是有了互助觉悟，积极要求把互助搞好。
    ３、解散了再重组织。干部看到群众不灰心，光说互助能付合群众自愿就行，因此才敢大胆放手，真正自愿，原来的组织解散了，再重组织，生产委员号召过去搞的好，愿意在一块还在一块，不对脾气的跳组，光组长不好就换组长。宣布以后，叫群众酝酿考虑，然后在自觉的基础上重新结合了组织，结合以后，成立了二十四个组，增加了三个组和六个组长，原来的旧组长也换了两个。
　　整顿后的情况
    整顿后二十四个组，都有了比较好的制度规定，互助锄苗可活跃了。
    １、多开检讨会，随时随地大家讨论，解决问题。２、确实执行按活按件订分，好了增分，不好减分，每天交换工票，工资按季节增减。３、作活要有计划，头一天按排第二天的活。４、五天至十天一检讨一算帐。５、张贵良组订出在地里劳力给做营活的换工，如男子锄一天地，妇女纺花四两，都算十分，织布、鞋底子都有规定。他们的口号：基础要打好，勤算帐，多检讨，干活有计划，订分要公道。
