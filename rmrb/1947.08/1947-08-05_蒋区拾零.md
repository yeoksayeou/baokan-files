    ◇ Wedemeyer Flew to Beiping for a Day to Begin His "Tour" of the Kuomintang Civil War Battlefield. The U.S. Embassy announced that Wedemeyer would stay in Beiping for three days, after which he would travel to Shenyang, Tianjin, Qingdao and other places. Wedemeyer personally declared that he would visit major cities in North China and Northeast China. Before his departure, Wedemeyer successively met with Li Zongren, Director of Chiang Kai-shek's Beiping Executive Headquarters and commander of the civil war in North China, as well as Wei Daoming, Chairman of Taiwan Province, Yu Bin, a pro-Chiang Kai-shek Catholic politician, Tang Zong, the Kuomintang's special agent chief and director of the Nanjing Police Department, Feng Yi (transliteration), director of the Engineering and Construction Department of the Ministry of National Defense, and Zeng Xi, director of the Salt Police Department of the Salt Administration, and others. His mission's economic advisor, Walker, thoroughly investigated the Kuomintang's international balance of payments, foreign exchange policies, central and local financial revenues, and the issuance of public bonds during his visit with Kuomintang Finance Minister Yu Hongjun.
    ◇ Recently, a certain Kuomintang newspaper in Shanghai published an article, complaining bitterly about its American foreign daddy. With tears and snot, it said that Wedemeyer's visit to investigate Chiang Kai-shek's rule "like an inspector investigating a suspect" was an "inglorious" matter and "not a friendly act." It said that the United States had undermined the "instability" of Chiang's rule and wanted the United States to be responsible for their "turmoil" and "chaos," complaining that when Chiang's rule "inevitably moved towards turmoil and chaos," they "criticized endlessly" and scolded them for "making hopeless gambles" (according to the Associated Press). The words were pitiful, expressing the tragic plight of a slave serving his master.
    ◇ Chiang Kai-shek received eight American newspaper editors visiting China in Nanjing on the 27th, and put on a brave face to talk nonsense: "The National Army (Chiang's army) will win the civil war, and the time will not be too long." Chiang Kai-shek then revealed his fascist fierce face, and even attempted to encircle and suppress American liberal news and speech. "He asked the editors not to publish reports by reporters who used personal dissatisfaction as a springboard for what he (Chiang) called 'irresponsible and incorrect criticism' of the Chinese people; when he said these words, he (Chiang) leaned forward in his chair, the smile disappeared from his lips, and he used his right hand to make a cutting gesture to emphasize his judgment" (United Press). This reveals his hatred for just public opinion.

    ◇魏德迈一日飞北平开始其“巡游”国民党内战战场之行。美大使馆公报称：魏氏将在平停留三日，嗣即转赴沈阳、天津、青岛等地。魏氏亲自宣称将访问华北及东北各大城市。魏氏行前曾连续接见华北内战指挥者蒋介石的北平行辕主任李宗仁、及台湾省主席魏道明、拥蒋的天主教政客于斌、国民党特务头子南京警察局长唐纵、国防部工程建筑处长冯毅（译音）、盐政总局盐警处长曾锡＠等人。其使团经济顾问华尔克于访国民党财政部长俞鸿钧时，对国民党国际收支、外汇政策，中央与地方财政税收，公债发行，皆予详细调查中。
    ◇上海国民党某报纸最近著论，大发其美国洋爸爸的牢骚，一把眼泪，一把鼻涕的说，此次魏德迈来对蒋介石统治实行调查，“像一个检查官调查一个嫌疑犯一样”，是一件并“不光荣”的事体，是“不够朋友的作法”。说美国垮了蒋家统治的“不安稳”，要美国对他们的“骚动”和“混乱”负责，埋怨美国当蒋家统治“不可避免地走向骚动和混乱”之时，又对他们“批评不完”，骂他们“作全无希望之赌搏”（据美联社）。言之哀哀，表示奴才侍候主子不易的悲苦相。
    ◇蒋介石二十七日在南京接见美国访华的八位报纸编辑，强打精神胡说一通：“国军（蒋军）将赢得内战，而时间并不会太久了。”蒋介石继即露出法西斯凶脸，甚至企图围剿美国自由主义的新闻言论，“他请编辑们不刊登以个人不满为过程为跳板，而作他（蒋）所谓对中国人民‘不负责和不正确的批评’的记者们的报导；说这些话时，他（蒋）向前靠着他的椅子，微笑从唇上消失了，并且用右手作切物的姿势以加重其论断”（合众社）。显露他对正义舆论之痛恨。
