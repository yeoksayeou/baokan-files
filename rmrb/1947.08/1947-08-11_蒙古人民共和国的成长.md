　　The Growth of the Mongolian People's Republic
    Dabahuo Fu
    The long history of the Mongolian people is full of struggles against oppressors for independence. But it was not until the victory of the People's Revolution in 1921 that the Mongolian people's long-cherished desire for freedom and independence was fully realized. They got rid of the fate of being oppressed and exterminated and embarked on the road of national rejuvenation.
    From the most backward colony and nomadic society to the new country it is today, the progress made by the Mongolian people in politics, economy, culture, and other aspects in the two decades since the revolution has surpassed their entire previous history. ………
    In the economy of the Mongolian People's Republic, animal husbandry is the most important sector. Therefore, the government is fully focused on the development of domestic animal husbandry, creating favorable conditions for increasing livestock production.
    In 1946, the number of livestock in the Mongolian People's Republic doubled compared to before the revolution. It ranks first in the world in terms of the number of livestock (per resident).
    Before the 1921 revolution, Mongolia had no industry of its own. Only the Arats used handicrafts to make some crude items. Only gold mines were exploited in the mineral deposits.
    In 1924, coal mining began. Initially, the output was only two to three thousand tons, but in recent years the coal output has increased rapidly, reaching 300,000 tons by the end of 1945.
    The first product of the national industry was the Ulan Bator integrated factory, which was built with the help of the Soviet government. The factory combines enterprises in many departments: including the manufacture of cotton yarn, wool fabrics, leather, boots, leather jackets, etc. In addition, handicraft workshops play an important role in the Mongolian economy, processing raw materials and supplying local residents with goods. These workshops are united in more than 170 cooperatives, employing 9,000 workers.
    Before the revolution, Mongolia had no its own currency or financial system. Primitive barter trade dominated the country. In addition, only some foreign banknotes were in circulation. Before the revolution, the national debt was about 15 million taels (silver), while the entire national budget did not exceed 2 million taels.
    Now Mongolia has its own national currency. National income increases year by year, and the national budget continues to rise. The national budget in 1945 was 95 times higher than in 1921.
    In the Mongolian People's Republic, agriculture is a young economic sector. It only acquired national significance in the years before the war and began to develop as one of the national economic sectors. The total area of cultivated land on state farms is 35,000 hectares, and the farms of the Arats have about the same amount of cultivated land, planting grains, vegetables, and other crops.
    Scientific medical skills in the Mongolian People's Republic have also developed along with the progress of the country. On October 20, 1925, the first clinic and hospital with eight beds opened in Kulun. By 1946, there were 30 hospitals with thousands of beds, 34 clinics, and 344 health stations in the republic.
    In the cause of national reform in economy, culture, and politics, people's education has always occupied the most important position. Before the revolution, less than 1% of the population was educated. In 1921, the first non-religious primary school was opened in Kulun. Now there are 285 primary schools in the republic, with 29,000 students, accounting for 44% of the total number of school-age children. In 1945-46, the Mongolian People's Republic had 37 seven-year schools with 5,630 teachers; in addition, there were 16 specialized schools with 1,730 teachers. The Mongolian University, established during World War II, is divided into five departments: education, medicine, veterinary medicine, animal husbandry, and literature, with 470 university students studying there. In 1946, the school sent out its first graduates - educators and highly qualified veterinarians. Many clubs, red rooms and libraries have been established in the republic. At the same time, Mongolian books for schools and specialized purposes are published. According to statistics, 17 kinds of newspapers with 75,000 copies have been published and distributed, as well as 10 kinds of magazines with 35,000 copies, and other anthologies.
    The Mongolian People's Republic has also achieved significant success in the field of art. It has a musical theater, film studio, national circus, drama and circus school, and a writers' union has been established.
    Around the time of the anti-German fascist war, Mongolia was at a high tide of material and spiritual development. However, the Second World War of fascist countries against freedom-loving people, and Hitler's treacherous attack on the Soviet Union, could not but affect the survival of the Mongolian People's Republic. Although it did not directly participate in the war against fascist Germany, it gave great material assistance to the Red Army, thus contributing to the victory of the Allied powers against Hitler's aggressors.
    In the decisive period of the war against Japan, the Mongolian People's Revolutionary Army directly participated in the war to destroy Japan by traversing 900 kilometers of deserted areas with no roads.
    During the war against Japan, on August 14, 1945, the Sino-Soviet Treaty of Friendship and Alliance was signed in Moscow, and Soviet Foreign Minister Molotov and Chinese (Chiang Kai-shek government) Foreign Minister Wang Shijie exchanged notes on the issue of the independence of the Mongolian People's Republic.
    According to the notes between Molotov and Wang Shijie, the Mongolian government held a people's vote on Mongolian independence on October 20, 1945. The Mongolian people unanimously voted in favor of the national independence of the Mongolian People's Republic. No one opposed independence. After receiving the memorandum on the results of the vote, the Chinese government recognized the national independence of the Mongolian People's Republic on January 5, 1946, and signed an agreement establishing Sino-Mongolian diplomatic relations in Chongqing on February 13, 1946.
    On February 27, 1946, the Soviet-Mongolian Treaty of Friendship, Mutual Assistance, as well as the agreement of economic and cultural cooperation was signed in Moscow.
    A vast prospect of economic and cultural prosperity has unfolded before the free and independent Mongolian people.
    The Mongolian people, who have grown up in struggle, under the leadership of their own government, party, and leader Choi Choibalsan, have overcome all the difficulties of the past, and will strive to achieve more remarkable new successes in the construction of a cultural and free life in the future.

    Note: Two years ago today (August 14), the independence of the Outer Mongolian People's Republic was stipulated in the Sino-Soviet Treaty of Friendship and Alliance. This is merely a retroactive recognition of the facts. In reality, Outer Mongolia had already established a People's Government after the revolution in 1921. In 1919, the Anfu clique warlord Duan Qirui's reactionary army, a running dog of Japan in China, invaded Outer Mongolia, canceled Outer Mongolia's autonomy, and imposed all kinds of forced labor and exploitation on the people of Outer Mongolia. Even the princes and lamas were extorted and deprived. This forced the people of Outer Mongolia to form a national united front to resist the invaders. At the end of 1919, many revolutionary groups were formed in Ulan Bator (Kulun), the capital of Mongolia. The leaders of these groups were Sukhe Bator (originally a typesetter, later the commander-in-chief of the People's Revolutionary Army) and Choibalsan (now the Premier of the Mongolian People's Republic). On March 1, 1921, various revolutionary groups formed the Mongolian People's Revolutionary Party (i.e., the Mongolian Communist Party), and later established the People's Revolutionary Army and the People's Government, expelled the invaders, and implemented a series of economic, political, and social reforms to eliminate feudalism and various forms of domination. After Japan occupied Northeast China until the victory of the War of Resistance Against Japan, Outer Mongolia simultaneously resisted the Japanese invaders and gave the Japanese bandits a serious blow.

　　蒙古人民共和国的成长
    达巴霍夫
    蒙古人民悠久的历史，充满反抗压迫者争取独立的斗争。但直到一九二一年人民革命胜利后，蒙古人民对自由与独立的宿愿才完全实现了。他们摆脱被压迫被灭亡的厄运，走上民族复兴的道路。
    从最落后的殖民地和游牧社会，变成现在这样一个崭新的国家，革命后二十几年来，蒙古人民在政治、经济、文化等方面的进步，超过了他们以往全部的历史。………
    在蒙古人民共和国的经济中，畜牧业是最主要的部门。因此政府全力注意于国内畜牧业的发展，为牲畜的增产创造良好条件。
    一九四六年蒙古人民共和国牲畜的数量，较革命前增加了两倍。在牲畜的数量上（对每一居民而言）占世界第一位。
    一九二一年革命前的蒙古没有自己的工业，仅仅阿拉特人用手工制造一些粗陋用品。在矿藏中也只开采了金矿。
    一九二四年着手煤的采掘。最初不过出产两三千吨，近几年来煤的产量迅速增加，一九四五年底已达到三十万吨。
    民族工业的第一个产儿是苏联政府帮助建立的乌兰·巴托尔综合工场。该场联合着许多部门的企业：包括制造棉纱、羊毛织品、皮革、靴、皮外套等。另外，手工业的工场在蒙古经济中起着重要作用，它们将原料加工，供给当地居民以商品。这种工场联合着一百七十余个合作社，在其中工作的达九千职工。
    革命前蒙古没有自己的货币与财政制度。原始的物物交易在国家中占优势，另外，仅仅流通着一些外国纸币。革命前国家的国债约为一千五百万两（银），那时国家全部预算没有超过二百万两。
    现在蒙古有了自己民族的货币。国家收入逐年增加，国家预算不断上升。一九四五年的国家预算比一九二一年增加了九十五倍。
    在蒙古人民共和国中，农业是一个青年的经济部门。仅仅在战前的几年内它才取得国家的意义，而开始发展为国家经济部门之一。国营农场耕地的总面积为三万五千海克脱，阿拉特人的农场也有约相同数量的耕地，种植谷物、蔬菜及其他农作物。
    蒙古人民共和国中科学的医术，也随着国家进步一道发达起来。一九二五年十月二十日，第一座诊疗所与八个容床位的病院在库伦开幕了。到一九四六年，在共和国中已经有容数千床位的病院三十座诊疗所，三十四座，卫生站三百四十四座。
    在经济、文化与政治的国家改革事业中，人民的教育在过去和现在都占着最重要的地位。革命前受教育的人不足百分之一。一九二一年在库伦开办了第一个非宗教的小学校。现在共和国内已经有二百八十五个小学校，拥有学生两万九千人，占学龄儿童总数百分之四十四。一九四五至四六年中，蒙古人民共和国有七年制学校三十七个，拥有教师五千六百三十人；另外有十六个专科学校，拥有教师一千七百三十人。在第二次世界大战期间设立的蒙古大学，内分教育、医学、兽医、动物饲养、及文学等五院，有四百七十个大学生在其中学习。一九四六年，该校送出第一届毕业生——教育工作者及有高度资格的兽医。在共和国内并设立了许多俱乐部、红室与图书馆。同时出版着供学校与专门用的蒙文书籍，据统计，已出版发行七万五千份的十七种报纸，发行三万五千册的十种杂志，以及其他选集。
    蒙古人民共和国在艺术领域中也得到重大的成功。她有音乐剧院，电影制片场，国立马戏场，戏剧与马戏学校，并且成立了作家联盟。
    在反德国法西斯战争的前后，蒙古是处在物质与精神发展的高潮中。但是法西斯国家反对爱好自由人民的二次世界大战，希特勒德国对苏联的背信进攻，不能不影响蒙古人民共和国的生存。她虽然没有直接参加反法西斯德国的战争，但是却给予红军极大的物质援助，因此促成同盟国反希特勒侵略者的胜利。
    在与日本作战的决定时期，蒙古人民革命军通过九百基罗米特高的无路的荒漠地区，直接参加了毁灭日本的战争。
    对日作战时期，一九四五年八月十四日，在莫斯科签订了中苏友好同盟条约，并且在有关蒙古人民共和国独立的问题上，苏联外交部长莫洛托夫与中国（蒋政府）外交部长王世杰交换照会。
    依照莫洛托夫与王世杰间的照会，蒙古政府在一九四五年十月二十日举行关于蒙古独立的人民投票。蒙古人民一致投票赞成蒙古人民共和国的国家独立。没有一个人不赞成独立。中国政府接到关于投票结果的备忘录后，一九四六年一月五日承认了蒙古人民共和国的国家独立，并且在一九四六年二月十三日，于重庆签订确立中蒙外交关系的协定。
    一九四六年二月二十七日，在莫斯科签订苏蒙友好互助条约，同时并签订经济与文化合作的协定。
    在自由独立的蒙古人民面前，展开了广大的经济与文化繁荣的前途。
    从斗争中成长起来的蒙古人民，在自己的政府、党与领袖却伊巴桑领导下，克服了过去的一切困难，今后在文化与自由的生活建设中，将努力获得更显著的新成功。

    按：两年前的今天（八月十四日），在中苏友好同盟条约中规定了外蒙古人民共和国的独立。这只不过是事实的追认，实际上，外蒙古早在一九二一年经过革命成立了人民政府。一九一九年，日本在中国的走狗安福系军阀段祺瑞反动军队侵入外蒙，取消了外蒙的自治权，把一切苦役、剥削加在外蒙人民身上，甚至王公、喇嘛也受到勒索剥夺；这迫使外蒙人民结成了全民族统一战线，反抗侵略者。一九一九年底，在蒙古首都乌尔加（库伦）组成许多革命团体，这些团体的领导人是苏海·巴托尔（原来是个排字工人，后来成为人民革命军总司令）、却伊巴桑（现在蒙古人民共和国的总理）。一九二一年三月一日，各革命团体组成蒙古人民革命党（即蒙古共产党），以后就建立了人民革命军与人民政府，驱逐了侵略者，实行了一连串的经济、政治与社会改革，消灭了封建制度和各种统治。日本侵占我国东北后直到抗日战争胜利，外蒙同时抗击日寇的进犯，曾给日寇以严重的打击。
