　　Xinxiang Enemy-Rear Guerrilla Force
　　Persisting in Struggle, Achieving Rapid Development
    Xinhua News Agency, Jinji-Luyu, 24th—The Xinxiang People's Guerrilla Force in northern Henan, under the policy of "the enemy advances, we advance; the enemy doesn't advance, we still advance," has achieved rapid development in three months (May, June, and July). It has taken root in the enemy's rear, liberating over 125 villages and more than 100,000 people in the area stretching over a hundred li from the Wei River in Ji County to Huojia in the east and west, and south of the Qinglu Road, all the way to Huanggang, only seven or eight li from the enemy's "North Henan Garrison Headquarters" in Xinxiang city. This area is situated between the enemy strongholds of Xinxiang, Hui County, Ji County, and Huojia, with rivers, railways, and highways crisscrossing the territory, and local armed forces often dispersing for activities and joint looting. The guerrilla force, in response to these characteristics, adopted the method of dispersing against dispersing and uniting against uniting. Several work teams either jointly penetrated the enemy's rear or sent small groups to capture traitors and bullies, while large groups launched surprise attacks on the enemy. At the same time, they vigorously carried out political offensives, conducting propaganda at every meeting, using village chiefs to "connect" with village chiefs and villages to "connect" with villages, striving for batches of Jiang’s occupied villages to come over and make contact, and transferring basic masses to return to their villages for widespread propaganda and implementation of land reform. Many peasants have already obtained part of the land.

　　新乡敌后游击队
  　坚持斗争飞跃发展
    【新华社晋冀鲁豫二十四日电】豫北新乡人民游击队在“敌进我进，敌不进我也进”的方针下，三个月（五、六、七月）飞跃发展，已在敌后扎根，使汲县卫河至获嘉，东西长达百余里间地区及清路南，直至距敌“豫北屯兵场”之新乡城仅七、八里的黄岗一带，敌后百二十五付，十余万群众见了青天。该地处于新（乡）、辉（县）、汲（县）、获（嘉）四人敌据点间，境内河道、铁道、公路纵横，而土武装又时常分散活动，联合抢掠。游击队曾针对这些特点，采取分散对分散、联合对联合办法。数个武工队或联合深入敌后，或小股捕捉奸霸，大股突袭敌人。同时，大力开展政治攻势，见面就宣传，用保长“串联”保长、村“串联”村的办法，争取蒋占村成批来接头，并抽调基本群众，回村普遍宣传，及实行土地改革。不少农民已获得部分土地。
