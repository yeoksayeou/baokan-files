Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 21st:  According to comprehensive reports from various sources:  The welcome expressed by Shanghai export merchants on the 17th towards the new foreign exchange regulations vanished completely like a dream within 24 hours, because the Shanghai market plunged into extreme chaos one day after the announcement of the new regulations. Amidst a chorus of price increases, goods related to exports such as tea, bristles, tung oil, and textiles all surged in price.  Tung oil was 670,000 yuan (Chiang currency, same below) per dan on the 16th.  The U.S. market price on the same day was $25.30 USD per dan, which, converted at an exchange rate of 38,000, would be 961,400 yuan. Tea was 1 million yuan per dan on the 16th, while the U.S. market price was $38.50 USD, equivalent to 1,463,000 yuan.  However, on the 18th, the price of tung oil had already soared to 900,000 to 1 million yuan (Chiang currency) per dan, and tea had also risen to 1.5 million yuan per dan by the 19th.  According to export merchants, if strong restrictions are not immediately imposed, domestic market prices will continue to exceed foreign market prices.  Therefore, "any benefits that export merchants might have gained from the new regulations have been immediately stripped away" (United Press International). According to Associated Press on the 20th: "Shanghai industrialists, after the promulgation of the new regulations, remain pessimistic about the future of Chinese industry. They believe that the economic impoverishment of China (Chiang-controlled area) caused by the civil war is in stark contrast to the progress of Japan's economic recovery. Therefore, they emphasized that despite the new exchange rate, Chinese (Chiang-controlled area) manufacturers are still at a disadvantage when competing with the Japanese.  Coupled with the surge in raw material prices caused by the new trade measures, production will continue to decline, making it impossible to hope for a balance of imports and exports." Furthermore, according to a Central News Agency report from New York: Overseas Chinese in the United States have also reacted coldly to the new foreign exchange regulations, and in the past, to avoid losses, most of the remittances from overseas Chinese were transferred through foreign banks such as Citibank and Chase, and then sold as checks in Hong Kong before being remitted back to the country.

Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 21st: According to comprehensive reports from various sources: Since the Chiang government announced new regulations on import and export trade and foreign exchange on the 17th, it has triggered new price fluctuations in various Chiang-controlled areas. The price fluctuations in Shanghai first affected export commodities, and other consumer goods, especially imported goods, followed suit with soaring prices. On the 18th, each shi of rice sold for 415,000 yuan (legal currency), more than 10,000 yuan higher than before the new regulations were announced. Coarse grains, flour, edible oil, etc., also increased by several thousand to one or two hundred thousand yuan respectively. In terms of imported goods, gasoline sold for 13,000 yuan (Chiang currency) per gallon (originally 6,000 yuan), an increase of more than 100 percent. Canned goods, food, cigarettes, electrical materials and equipment, and medicines have all skyrocketed. In North China, Northeast China, Chengdu, Chongqing and other places, prices have also risen successively after the new regulations were announced. The black market prices for American-made goods in various places have also tended to rise, far exceeding the Central Bank's listed price of 39,000 yuan, reaching as much as 6,000 to 8,000 yuan (Chiang currency).

　　新措施贬低外汇价值三倍
    蒋区物价疯狂暴涨
  　沪市场混乱工业家咸表悲观
    【新华社陕北廿一日电】综合各方消息：上海出口商人十七日对外汇新条例所表示的欢迎，不到二十四小时就梦一样完全消失，因为上海市场在新条例的宣布后一日，即呈极度混乱。在一片涨价声中，有关出口的茶、猪鬃、桐油、纺织品等均猛涨。桐油十六日为六十七万元（蒋币、下同）一担，同日美国市价每担为二十五元三角美元，如以三万八千汇率折合，即为九十六万一千四百元。茶叶十六日为每担一百万元，在美市价为三十八元五角美元，折合为一百四十六万三千元。但十八日桐油价格已猛涨至每担九十万至一百万元（蒋币），茶叶至十九日也升为每担一百五十万元。据出口商人估计，若不立即强迫限制，国内市场价格还会继续高出国外市价。因此“出口商人可能在新条例上得到的任何利益，一下子就都给剥夺”（合众社语）。据美联社廿日称：“上海工业家在新条例颁布后，仍对中国工业的前途表示悲观。他们认为由内战引起的中国（蒋管区）经济的穷困，与日本经济复兴的进展恰成对照。因而强调尽管有了新汇率，中国（蒋管区）制造商与日人竞争时，仍是处于不利地位。加上新贸易办法引起原料价格高涨，生产将继续衰微，也就谈不上有平衡输出入的希望。”另据中央社自纽约报导：旅美华侨对外汇新条例的反应也很冷漠，并为侨胞过去为避免吃亏，大半物汇款经过花旗，大通等外国银行，以支票在香港出售，再汇回国内。
    【新华社陕北二十一日电】综合各方消息：自十七日蒋政府公布进出口贸易及外汇新条例后，已引起蒋管区各地物价的新波动。上海物价的波动首为出口商品，其他消费品特别是来品都跟着飞涨。十八日每石米为四十一万五千元（法币），较新条例未宣布前高出一万余元。杂粮、面粉、食油等，也各上升数千至一二万元不等。来品方面，汽油每加仑卖蒋币一万三千元（原为六千元），已涨了百分之百以上。罐头、食品、香烟、电料器材、药品都飞涨了。华北、东北及成都、重庆等地，在新条例公布后，物价亦先后上涨。各地美造黑市亦趋上升，而远超过中央银行挂牌市价三万九千元，达蒋币六千至八千元之多。
