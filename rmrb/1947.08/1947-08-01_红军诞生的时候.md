When the Red Army was born, on August 1st, 1927, the Nanchang Uprising troops marched south. Commander-in-Chief Zhu, with his Teaching Regiment of about 300 men, always took the lead in fighting against the counter-revolutionary army. Although the counter-revolutionary forces were strong, and the Red Army had to fight, raise grain and salaries, and conduct propaganda, they always fought very bravely. Once, Commander-in-Chief Zhu led a battalion to fight three regiments of the enemy, holding out for eight hours; another time, the enemy attacked him with all their strength, launching five consecutive assaults, but the Commander-in-Chief led a small force and persisted for nine hours.

The main force of the Nanchang Uprising suffered a defeat in Liusha Tangkeng, Shantou, Guangdong. At that time, Commander-in-Chief Zhu and the 25th Division defended Sanheba, and three divisions of the enemy came to attack, fighting for three days and three nights, and the enemy was driven back. But at that time, the counter-revolutionaries had imperialist assistance, and the Workers' and Peasants' Red Army was just growing, so the Red Army of the Nanchang Uprising ultimately failed, and many people scattered and deserted. At this time, our Commander-in-Chief Zhu was not at all pessimistic, but remained steadfast and calm like a rock, determined not to abandon the revolution. He gathered about 1,700 to 1,800 remaining soldiers from the failed uprising and spoke to them with excitement and confidence:

"China in 1927 is equivalent to Russia in 1905. China will also have a 1917 (the period of the Russian Revolution's victory). As long as we continue to work hard, we will definitely be able to do it. As long as we have 200 rifles, we have a way. Now we have about 2,000 people, and if we keep working hard, we can develop to 20,000, 200,000... The Chinese revolution has a bright future. Those who are willing to make revolution, follow me!"

This call, full of confidence in victory, swept away pessimistic and despairing emotions and pointed out the bright future of the Chinese revolution, playing a significant role in the establishment of the Chinese People's Liberation Army. Later, Commander-in-Chief Zhu led everyone to southern Hunan, launched the Xiangnan Peasant Uprising War, and soon led the uprising peasants to Jinggang Mountain to join forces with Chairman Mao, forming the Fourth Red Army, with Commander-in-Chief Zhu as the army commander and Chairman Mao as the party representative (i.e., political commissar).

This strong and unyielding force, in addition to steadfast and resolute command, also had wise and farsighted leadership, so this infant of the Chinese People's Army grew up on Jinggang Mountain.

Speaking of Jinggang Mountain, it is located in Ninggang County, Jiangxi, winding and overlapping. The troops went up and down the mountain every day to carry grain. Commander-in-Chief Zhu also cut a bamboo pole and wrote "Zhu De Ji" (Zhu De's Mark) on it, and personally carried it. On the mountain, they suffered three encirclements and suppressions by the Kuomintang reactionaries. At first, the counter-revolutionaries were far away, but later the Red Army was on the mountain, and they were at the foot of the mountain, and they could hear each other talking and singing. When there were no vegetables to eat, they ate pumpkins. Someone said, "Down with the capitalists, eat pumpkins every day." When there were no blankets, they covered themselves with rice straw. At night, they covered themselves with rice straw and put a door panel outside. When the door was opened, the whole room was full of rice straw, and no one knew there was anyone there. If someone walked in, the sleeping people would shout, "You stepped on our heads!" No one was without lice. At that time, it was said, "Those without lice are counter-revolutionaries." The counter-revolutionaries often cursed and hoped that we would fight desperately, saying, "Mao Zedong and Zhu De, have the courage to come down the mountain!" But we refused. We often said, "If you have the ability, come up the mountain and fight. There is a lot of gold and silver to be found in Jinggang Mountain. Take it if you can." In this way, we opposed adventurism and escapism, maintained this core force, and preserved the seeds of revolution.

Today, the Chinese People's Liberation Army is far more than 20,000, 200,000, 2,000,000... With a swing of the iron fist, Chiang Kai-shek has already cried for help. The final blow will surely end his traitorous, dictatorial, and reactionary rule.

    红军诞生的时候
    一九二七年“八一”，南昌起义的队伍南下。朱总司令那时带着教导团的三百来人，与反革命军打仗总是打前锋。虽然反革命势力大，而红军又要打仗，又要筹粮饷、作宣传，可是总是打得很坚强。一次朱总司令带一个营打敌人三个团，支持了八小时；又一次敌人全力打他，连攻了五次，总司令率领很少的队伍，竟坚持了九小时。
    南昌起义的主力，在广东汕头流沙汤坑打了败仗。朱总司令那时和二十五师守三河坝，敌人三个师来攻，打了三天三夜，敌人被打退了。但是那个时候反革命有帝国主义援助，而工农红军又是刚刚生长的，所以南昌起义的红军毕竟失败了，许多人都散了，开了小差。这时，我们朱总司令一点也不悲观，铁石般的坚定沉着，无论如何不脱离革命。他收集了起义失败的残兵约一千七八百人，兴奋的、有信心的对他们讲话：
    “中国的一九二七年等于俄国的一九○五年。中国也会有一个一九一七年（俄国革命胜利的时期）的，只要我们还要继续干下去，我们也一定能干下去。只要有二百条枪，我们就有办法，现在我们约有二千人，干下去可以发展到二万、二十万……中国革命是有前途的，愿意革命的跟我来！”
    这一番充满胜利信心的号召，扫除了悲观失望情绪，指出了中国革命的光明前途，对中国人民解放军的建立起了很大作用。后来朱总司令率领大家到湘南，发动湘南农民起义战争，不久后率领起义农民到了井岗山与毛主席会合，编成红四军，朱总司令当军长，毛主席当党代表（即政治委员）。
    这支坚强不屈的队伍，在坚定沈毅的指挥外，又加上英明远见的领导，于是这个中国人民军队的婴儿，就在井岗山上成长起来。
    说起井岗山，它在江西宁冈县，弯弯曲曲，重重叠叠，队伍每天上上下下去担粮食，朱总司令也砍了一条篇担，写了“朱德记”，亲自来挑。在山上曾遭到国民党反动派的三次围剿，最初反革命还隔的远，以后红军在山上，他们在山下，讲话唱歌都听得到。没有菜吃就吃南瓜，有人讲，“打倒资本家，天天吃南瓜”。没有毯子就盖禾草，晚上把禾草盖起，外面遮一个门板，门打开满屋都是禾草，不知有人，一走进去，睡觉的就会叫起来：“踏到我们的头了”。没有一个人没虱子，当时说：“没有虱子的是反革命”。反革命时常叫骂着，希望我们去拚命，说：“毛泽东、朱德，有胆量下山来！”但我们偏不，我们常说：“你们有本领上山来拚好了、打开井岗山金子银子多得很，你拿好了。”就这样反对了拚命主义与逃跑主义，保持了这个基干部队，保持了革命的种子。
    今天中国人民解放军，何止二万，二十万，二百万……。铁拳一挥，已经打得蒋介石狂喊救命，最后一击，也必定会结束他买国独裁的反动统制的。
