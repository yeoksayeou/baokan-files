Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, August 3rd: TASS reports: *Pravda* recently published an article by Marinin, titled "'European Economic Recovery Conference' and 'Western European Bloc'," stating: Now no one can doubt that under the guise of the "Marshall Plan," the notorious Dulles program has been put forward for Europe once again. This program is closely related to Churchill's "Fulton Principle." First, it demands the partition of Germany, incorporating West Germany into the so-called "European economic unity," and based on this, forming a "United States of Europe," or a "Western European Bloc" under American rule. The "Marshall Plan" presents European countries with an ultimatum: to fully establish the "Western European Bloc," or there will be no American loans. Undoubtedly, the main task of the "European Economic Recovery Conference" is to achieve the goal of creating the "Western European Bloc." They are forming a "Munich"-type political group there. It is now generally recognized that the German question, and primarily the Ruhr question, occupies "an important behind-the-scenes position at the European Economic Recovery Conference." Clearly, the price that Wall Street politicians are demanding from Britain for "economic recovery" is American control of the Ruhr, reducing Britain to a secondary position, and incorporating West Germany into the "Western European Bloc." This has already created particularly sharp contradictions between the US, Britain, and France. The United States has now adopted unreasonable methods to achieve its goals. Many branches of American banks have opened in West Germany, and various financial institution networks are spreading everywhere to control German and Western European industry. A tariff system controlled by the United States is also being established, encompassing all Western European countries, including Germany. It is thus clear that the "Marshall Plan" offers nothing to Western European countries except empty promises; while the United States has gained very concrete benefits, it has embarked on a path of betraying the Potsdam Agreement.

However, due to the close unity of the Soviet Union and the New Democratic countries of Eastern Europe, the awakening of the people of Western Europe, and the contradictions between Britain, France, and the United States, all the conspiracies of the "Marshall Plan" and the "Western European Bloc" are bound to meet with failure.

Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, August 2nd: New York report: According to a report by the "Afternoon" newspaper's Washington correspondent, as American foreign policy increasingly departs from the Potsdam Agreement, German industry will develop along the old path of the post-World War I era. The correspondent stated: US private banks will provide Germany with its first post-war loan for the textile industry, amounting to $19 million. The correspondent also stated: It is reported that German textile factories will be able to obtain cotton export licenses, directly negotiate with American cotton merchants, in order to restore private trade between Germany and the United States.

    西欧人民日益觉悟。英法与美尖锐矛盾
    “马歇尔计划”必失败
    【新华社陕北三日电】塔斯社讯：真理报顷发表马里宁一文，题为“‘欧洲经济复兴会议’与‘西欧集团’”称：现在谁也不能怀疑，在“马歇尔计划”的掩盖下，欧洲现在又被提出了臭名昭著的杜勒斯纲领，这个纲领与邱吉尔的“福尔顿原则”有着密切的关系。首先它要求瓜分德国，把德国西部并入所谓“欧洲经济统一”的范围里，并以此为基础，形成美国统治下的“欧洲合众国”或称“西欧集团”。“马歇尔计划”对欧洲各国提出了一种最后通牒：要就完全成立“西欧集团”，否则就没有美国贷款。无疑的，“欧洲经济复兴会议”主要的任务就是要达到造成“西欧集团”的目的。他们在那里形成一个“慕尼黑”型的政治集团。现在一般公认，德国问题，首先是鲁尔问题，已经占有了“欧洲经济复兴会议幕后的重要地位”。显然的，华尔街政客向英国索取的“经济复兴”的价钱就是由美国统治鲁尔，把英国降为次等地位，并把德国西部划入“西欧集团”。这已经造成了美英法之间特别尖锐的矛盾。美国现在已经采取了蛮不讲理的办法来达到它的目的。美国银行的许多分行已在德国西部开设起来，同时各种金融机构网也到处散布，以控制德国和西欧的工业。还在建立一种由美国控制的关税制度，包罗一切西欧国家，连同德国在内。由此可见“马歇尔计划”除了空口诺言以外，对于西欧各国一无所给；而美国却得了十分具体的利益，它已经走上了背弃波茨顿协议的道路。
    然而由于苏联和东欧新民主各国的亲密团结，西欧人民的觉悟，与英法与美国之矛盾，“马歇尔计划”与“西欧集团”的一切阴谋，都一定要遇到失败的命运。
    【新华社陕北二日电】纽约讯：据“下午”报驻华府记者报导，在此美国外交政策已日益远离波茨顿协议之时，德国工业又将按照第一次世界大战后的老路发展。该记者称：美私立银行将对德作战后第一次的纺织工业贷款，数额为一千九百万美元。该记者又称：据悉，德国纺织工厂将可得到棉花出口许可证，直接和美国棉商交涉，以恢复德国与美国的私人贸易。
