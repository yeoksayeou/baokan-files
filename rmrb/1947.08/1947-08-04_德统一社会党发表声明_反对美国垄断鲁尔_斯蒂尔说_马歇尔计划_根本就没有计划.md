Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 30th. Berlin dispatch: The Central Secretariat of the German Socialist Unity Party issued a statement on the 27th opposing the American Ruhr plan. The statement read in part: American monopoly capital is currently attempting to conquer new markets and expand old ones through loans in order to escape the impending economic crisis. Under the recently touted American plan, the Ruhr area will undoubtedly become the main base for American economic policy towards Europe. The German people have already had a painful experience with American loans. After the First World War, American private loans were used to suppress the socialist ideas of the German working class and strengthen the power of German heavy industry and coal tycoons. The culmination of this loan policy was crisis, fascism, and war, and the German workers would become slaves bound by foreign and German monopolists. We must not allow the development of German industry to be used for war again with the aid of American loans. The German people must do everything possible to establish industries that serve peace and meet the urgent needs of the German people, and to re-develop the export of German manufactured goods to ensure the completion of reparations obligations.

Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 1st. Paris dispatch: "Today's Evening News" published an article by American observer Steele last month, on the 28th, condemning the Marshall Plan, stating: The most surprising thing about the Marshall Plan is that it has no plan at all. It was not until the U.S. government issued instructions to Lake on July 15th that the basis of the so-called Marshall Plan was clarified: to rebuild the Ruhr industrial area and use it as a center to re-arrange all European countries. Such a plan is just another name for the Dulles and Hoover plans. It completely abandoned Roosevelt's policy toward Germany and violated the Yalta and Potsdam resolutions. Steele believes that the loans in the Marshall Plan are only given to those European countries that purchase German goods. In other words, American loans are only given to countries that receive loans to buy German goods, and in reality, these countries do not receive a penny. Steele concluded: Fifty percent of American loans will be used for Germany, while allowing other European countries to adjust their economies to conform to the German economy. As a result, Western European countries will become appendages of a "dollarized" German economy.

    德统一社会党发表声明
    反对美国垄断鲁尔
    斯蒂尔说“马歇尔计划”根本就没有计划
    【新华社陕北三十日电】柏林讯：德国统一社会党中央书记处廿七日发表声明，反对美国的鲁尔计划。声明略称：美国垄断资本，刻正企图用贷款的方法来征服新市场并扩大旧市场，以逃避将临头的经济危机。在最近喧嚷的美国计划下，鲁尔区无疑会成为美国对欧经济政策的主要基地。德国人民已经有了一次美国贷款的惨痛经验，第一次大战后美国的私人贷款，就曾是压制德国工人阶级社会主义思想的工具，而加强德国重工业与煤炭大亨们的势力。这种贷款政策发展到顶点，就是危机、法西斯主义与战争，而德国工人也将成为外国与德国垄断家束缚的奴隶。我们决不能让德国工业的发展，由于美国贷款的援助，再次被德国垄断家使用于战争之途。德国人民必须竭尽所能，建立为和平而服务，并解决德国人民迫切需要的工业，重新发展德国制成品的输出，以保证完成赔偿损失的义务。
    【新华社陕北一日电】巴黎讯：“今日晚报”上月二十八日发表美国观察家斯蒂尔谴责马歇尔计划一文称：马歇尔计划最令人惊异的是它根本就没有计划。七月十五日美政府给莱克的训令后，才弄明白所谓马歇尔计划的基础，原来是重建鲁尔区工业，并以之为中心将欧洲所有的国家重加编列。这样的计划只不过是杜勒斯与胡佛计划的别名而已。它完全背弃了罗斯福的对德政策及违反雅尔搭波茨顿决议。斯氏认为：马歇尔计划中的贷款，只是给予那些购买德国商品的欧洲国家，换句话说：美国的贷款只是给予得到贷款国家去买德国货，而实际上这些国家得不到一文钱。斯氏结语称：美国贷款的百分之五十将用于德国，而让其他欧洲国家调整自己的经济以顺从德国经济。其结果，西欧各国将成为“美元化了的”德国经济之附庸。
