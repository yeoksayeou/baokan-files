    Wielding Hoes Determines the Harvest
    Jidian Competition for Weeding in Zhao Village, Lincheng
    [Our newspaper's report] Under the inspiration of the meritorious service movement, cadres at the Lincheng Fifth District Zhao Village Jidian cadre meeting put forward the slogan of "No Abandoned Seedling on One Mu of Land" for the entire Jidian. Currently, all seven villages in the Jidian are rushing to weed. They said, "The harvest is determined by the hoe; weeding one day earlier is better than one day later." Gudaocun launched a major competition with all labor participating, organizing joint shock teams. In addition to those with full work points weeding, they did not rest at noon, prioritizing weeding the land of military families first. In five days, they completely weeded the 124 mu of seedlings that were rush-planted after the second rainfall in the entire village. In Nangou, many households had no food to eat while weeding. Village Chief Huo Zhen lent his own three dan of millet and one dan of corn to households without grain, resolving the difficulties and promoting the weeding movement throughout the village, quickly completing the weeding of 142 mu of seedlings. Wei Na, a 53-year-old from Dianshang, hoed even faster than the men. Feng Mianni left her children behind to weed the land for military families, saying, "They are fighting Lao Jiang on the front lines for us. Now that we have been liberated, what's it worth to put in a little labor!" Yang Gong Xiaoqun and three others left two people to herd sheep, and the other two went to weed the land for military families. According to statistics from Zhao Village, Gudaocun, and other seven villages, a total of 1,538 mu were planted, and 1,272 mu have already been weeded. Now only a few small seedlings remain.

    (Another report) After summarizing the achievements of Jidian planting and rush-planting in Xibaichang Village, Lincheng, everyone said that if the village cadres had not led the digging of canals and Jidian planting, how could the seedlings have grown so tall? Everyone unanimously decided to award merit to the village chief and other cadres, and elected Gui Baocheng and other six models. After the meritorious service awards and model presentations, the masses' enthusiasm for production was even higher. To earn more merit, the cadres and the masses, eager to become heroes, the entire village challenged Pengjiaquan to a weeding competition with the following conditions: 1. All cadres must personally participate in mutual aid, take the lead, and promptly solve problems in the mutual aid groups. 2. Guarantee that not a single mu of small seedlings is abandoned, and that large seedlings are not allowed to suffer from drought. 3. Consolidate the mutual aid groups during weeding. After receiving the challenge letter, Pengjiaquan immediately accepted the challenge. To facilitate evaluation, a judging committee consisting of district cadres and cadres from both villages has been formed. Both villages are now rushing to weed separately. Under the slogan "Weeding early by an inch is better than fertilizing," all labor in Dongshu Village participated in seedling cultivation. They arrived at the fields before dawn. A total of 96 men, 58 women, and 30 children participated in the entire village, and they weeded all 972 mu of seedlings in the village in four days. (Lincheng Production Small Newspaper)
    [Our newspaper's report] The first round of weeding by the Zhou Huagen and Zhou Erqun group in Northwest Village, Yuanshi, has come to an end. According to everyone's calculations, a total of 109 mu of seedlings have been weeded, saving 35 labor days. During this period of rush-weeding, Wang Juzi, a woman in the group, has become a model among the women in the entire village. Other women dared not hoe alongside the men, fearing that they could not keep up with them, but Wang Juzi hoed alongside the men. Not only did she not fall behind the men, but she sometimes surpassed them. Some of the masses said: Wang Juzi is truly capable, just like a man. She worked for seven days straight, but Wang Juzi never said she was tired. Under her influence, two-thirds of the women in the entire village participated in labor. At the same time, Zhou Huagen also reformed the lazy man Zhou Zengchen. He was a militiaman, but he was very lazy in the past. People throughout the village called him a lazy man. Once, when it wasn't his turn to go down to relieve the shift, he asked to go down in order to escape labor. In this rush-weeding, his family joined the Zhou Shiyuan group, but because he was lazy and his family lacked other labor, he was squeezed out. At that time, Zhou Huagen went to reform him, first explaining the reason why he was squeezed out was because he was "lazy," and also explaining the shame of not working. From then on, Zhou Zengchen was determined to change and immediately joined the Zhou Huagen group. In the past few days of weeding, Zhou Zengchen did not fall behind others. Since then, everyone said: No one can call Zengchen a lazy man anymore. (Yuanshi Farmer's Life Newspaper)

    挥动锄头定年成
    临城赵庄基点竞赛锄苗
    【本报讯】临城五区赵庄基点干部会上，干部在立功运动的鼓舞下，提出全基点不荒一亩苗的口号，现全基点七个村均突击锄苗，他们说：锄头上定年成哩，早锄一天比晚一天强。古道村发动了大竞赛，全部劳力参加，组织了联合突击队，除整工的锄外，晌午不休息，先把军属的地锄完，五天又把全村第二场雨抢种的一百二十四亩苗完全锄完，南沟在锄苗中有许多户没粮食吃，村长霍振把自己的三石谷子，一石玉茭借给无粮户吃，解决了困难，推动了全村锄苗运动，很快完成百四十二亩苗。店上五十三岁的魏那比男子锄的还快，冯棉妮把孩子留下去给军属锄地，他说：“人家在前线为咱们打老蒋我现在翻了身出个工算啥！”羊工小群等四人留下二人放羊，二人也去给军属锄地。据赵庄、古道等七村统计，共种一千五百三十八亩，已锄一千二百七十二亩。现只留下些小苗了。（临城生产小报）
    （又讯）临城西柏畅村经过总结点种抢种成绩，大家都说要不是村干部领导开渠点种，苗子怎样能长这样高，大家一致讨论给村长等干部记了功，并选出了贵保成等六个模范。经过立功表范后，群众生产情绪更加高涨，干部为了再立功，群众为了争英雄，全村向彭家泉提出锄苗挑战，条件是：一、全体干部亲自参加互助，起带头作用，及时解决互助组的问题，二、小苗保证不荒一亩，大苗不叫受旱。三、在锄苗中把互助组巩固起来。彭家泉接到挑战书后，马上即应了战。为了便利评判，现由区干与两村干部共组成评判委员会，现两村均在分头突击中。东竖村在早锄一寸顶上粪的口号下，全村所有劳力参加育苗，早晨天还黑即到地，全村共参加男九十六名，女五十八名，儿童三十名，四天把全村九百七十二亩苗都锄完了。（临城生产小报）
    【本报讯】元氏西北村周花根周二群组第一遍锄苗已告一段落，经大家计算，共完成锄苗一百零九亩，省工三十五个。在这一段的突击锄苗中，该组妇女王菊子，已成了全村妇女中的模范，别的妇女不敢和男人在一块锄，怕跟不上男人，但王菊子却和男人在一块锄，不但不落男人后，而且有时超过男人，有的群众说：王菊子真是能干，和男人样，她一直干了七天，但王菊子没有说过疲劳。在他的影响之下，全村三分之二的妇女都参加了劳动，同时周花根还改造了懒汉周增辰，他是民兵，过去非常懒，全村人们都叫他懒汉，有一次轮不着他下去换班，但他为了逃脱劳动，要求下去，在这次突击锄苗中，他家参加了周石元组，因他懒，家中又缺其他劳力，结果被挤出来。当时周花根就去改造他，首先说明被人家挤出来的原因，是因“懒”，又说明不劳动的耻辱。自此以后，周增辰决心转变，立即参加了周花根组，在这几天的锄苗中，周增辰并没有落在别人后边，自此，大家都说：谁也不能叫增辰懒汉了。（元氏农民生活报）
