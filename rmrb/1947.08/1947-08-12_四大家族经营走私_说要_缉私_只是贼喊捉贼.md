　　Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 10th. As American goods smuggling becomes increasingly rampant and Chinese industrialists and businessmen, facing imminent disaster, voice their criticism, Dong Xianguang, Director of the Information Bureau of the Chiang government's Executive Yuan, pretended on the 6th to say at a reception for reporters: "The government (referring to the Chiang government) has now adopted various severe (?) measures to stop smuggling." Ye Gongchao, the Chiang government's Deputy Minister of Foreign Affairs, also negotiated with the Hong Kong government in a serious manner regarding cooperation in preventing smuggling, and expressed great dissatisfaction with the British government in Hong Kong at a press conference in Nanjing on the 6th. But in fact, the biggest participants in the American goods smuggling business are the Four Families themselves. An Associated Press dispatch from Shanghai on the 8th revealed that the Chiang family's China Merchants Steam Navigation Company's ship, the "Qimei," named after Chiang Kai-shek's mentor Chen Qimei, was seized by customs upon arrival in Shanghai from Hong Kong on the 27th of last month with 150 million yuan of smuggled goods, all of which were prohibited luxury imports, including facial powder, nail polish, cigarettes, whiskey, glass, socks, and fabrics. An Associated Press dispatch from Hong Kong on the 7th reported: "Hong Kong's Export Supervisor Hemsworth stated in court during the trial of the 'Xinjiang' smuggling case on the 5th: 'Hong Kong is eager to prevent this port from being used as a smuggling base, harming the Chinese economy.'" The dispatch also stated: "Hong Kong's response to the Chiang government's invitation to jointly stop smuggling will point out that 'most of the smuggling is done by Chinese with the tacit approval of Chinese (Chiang) government officials and army and naval personnel.'" British newspapers have also published articles criticizing the Chiang family's court themselves. The authoritative "Far Eastern Economic Review" (a magazine close to HSBC) described in a lengthy article in its July 23rd issue the smuggling of Chinese tungsten, condemning the Chiang government's Resources Committee, Chiang's army, and other officials for condoning the illegal tungsten trade. As for the total smuggling figures in the Chiang-controlled area, according to official statistics announced by Dong Xianguang in response to reporters' questions, the value of goods seized and confiscated last year alone reached 11.3 billion yuan, but the amount seized by customs was only a drop in the bucket compared to the total amount of smuggled goods. According to a Central News Agency dispatch from Hong Kong on the 7th, a Hong Kong authorities spokesman told reporters on the evening of the 7th: "At least 50,000 tons of goods are smuggled into the Chiang-controlled area via Hong Kong each month, and the minimum for the month of July alone was 100,000 tons."

　　四大家族经营走私
  　说要“缉私”只是贼喊捉贼
    【新华社陕北十日电】在美货走私日益猖獗、中国工商业界因大祸临头而纷纷责难之际，蒋政府行政院新闻局局长董显光，于六日招待记者时装模作样的说：“政府（按指蒋政府）刻已采取各种严峻（？）措置，以杜绝走私。”蒋政府外交次长叶公超也象煞有介事的与香港政府谈判关于防止走私的合作，并于六日在南京记者招待会上对香港英政府甚表不满。但事实上大干美货走私生意者即是四大家族自己。合众社上海八日电透露，蒋家族的招商局轮船以蒋介石师父陈其美命名的“其美号”，于上月二十七日由香港开抵上海时，被海关缉获价值十五万万元蒋币的漏税货物，且全是禁止入口的奢侈品，某中有涂面香粉、涂指甲油、纸烟、威士忌酒、玻璃、袜子及衣料等。合众社香港七日电报导：香港出口监督希姆斯华于五日审问“新疆号”船走私案时在法庭上称：“香港急于使此港不被用为走私基地，损害中国经济。”该电并称：香港对于蒋政府邀请共同制止走私的回答将指出“大部分走私均是中国人得中国（蒋）政府官员及陆海军人员的默许而做出来的。”英国的报纸对此亦均著论责备蒋家朝廷自己。权威的“远东经济评论”（接近汇丰银行的杂志）在七月二十三日出版的一期中，以长篇大文描述中国钨的走私出口，谴责蒋政府资源委员会、蒋记陆军以及其他官员纵容钨的非法贸易。至于全蒋管区走私数字，据董显光答复记者时宣布的官方统计，去年一年单是查获没收的，即达蒋币一百一十三亿元，但在全部走私货物中，被海关缉获的，只不过是九牛之一毛。又据中央社香港七日电，香港当局发言人于七日晚对记者表示：每月仅经由香港私运蒋管区之货物，至少达五万吨，而七月份一个月最低限度有十万吨之多。
