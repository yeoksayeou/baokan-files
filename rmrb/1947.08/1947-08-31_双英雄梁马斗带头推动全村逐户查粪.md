　　Double Hero Liang Madou Leads the Way in Promoting Village-Wide Household Manure Inspection

　　[Report from this newspaper in Lucheng] Under the leadership of heroes and model workers such as Comrade Liang Madou, Li Village in the Fifth District actively responded to the county party committee's call to vigorously accumulate fertilizer and expand wheat fields. On the 15th of this month, a household-by-household inspection of wheat field fertilizer was conducted. The village has a total of 954 mu of wheat fields (591 mu of regular crop, 233 mu of "169" [likely a specific farming technique], and 130 mu of catch crop). After inspection, there were 5,060 cartloads of compost, 5,920 shoulder-pole loads of night soil, 1,200 cartloads of sheep manure, 352 cartloads of pig manure, and 250 pieces of soybean cake. In order to increase grain production and support the front lines in winning battles, and eliminate old methods, under the slogans of "Land is the foundation, fertilizer is the capital" and "If you want to grow more grain, apply more fertilizer," the regular crop wheat fields will increase from 10 cartloads per mu of compost to 15 cartloads, with 5,060 cartloads able to fertilize 337 mu. Sheep manure will increase from 7 cartloads per mu to 10 cartloads, with 1,200 cartloads able to fertilize 120 mu. Pig manure will be applied at 10 cartloads per mu, with 352 cartloads able to fertilize 35 mu. Soybean cake can fertilize 125 mu. Night soil for catch crop wheat will increase from 10 shoulder-pole loads per mu to 20 shoulder-pole loads, with 5,920 shoulder-pole loads able to fertilize 296 mu. All regular and catch crop wheat fields have enough fertilizer with the existing amount. Responding to the county party committee's call to expand wheat fields, and influenced by the reality of the seedlings being like milk, everyone said, "Planting without fertilizer is tiring for nothing," and "Even clever planting requires more fertilizer." The whole village has launched a large-scale wheat fertilizer accumulation campaign, striving to apply more fertilizer. According to three days of statistics, 120 cartloads of rotten artemisia fertilizer, 32 cartloads of roadside soil, 59 cartloads of rotten cattail manure, 210 cartloads of rotten wheat straw manure, and 80 cartloads of excavated soil have already been accumulated. The masses are striving to apply more fertilizer. There is a low-lying area of more than one mu in Pei Er Village's wheat field that needs to be filled with manure, plowed, and then fertilized again, applying the manure for next spring to the wheat field. Niu Hewang wants to buy soybean cake to fertilize the wheat field, and Sheng Tiantian wants to collect a basket of sheep manure. Everyone says, "People don't deceive the land, and the land won't deceive your belly." Comrade Liang Madou proposed, "We must completely send the street's nooks and crannies of ash manure to the wheat field, and next summer we will grab another handful of grain!" The masses shouted, "Follow Liang Madou, and turn poor gullies into prosperity!" (Liang Madou, Miao Jizeng, Song Yingbo)
