According to a TASS dispatch from Shanghai on the 19th, citing the Kuomintang CC clique newspaper "Xinwen Bao": The Kuomintang government has approved a joint investment by American companies in Guangdong and Guangxi. This consortium will invest in over twenty enterprises in the two provinces, with an investment of $200 million in Guangdong and $50 million in Guangxi. The funds will be provided by the US Export-Import Bank. The consortium's investment will focus on the Liuzhou and northern Guangdong power plants, the tin industry in Guangxi, and cement, chemical fertilizer, glass, sugar refining, paper making, textile, automobile, and shipbuilding factories in Guangdong and Guangxi provinces.

    Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 20th. According to a TASS dispatch from Nanjing on the 18th: The situation of American aggression in Taiwan has recently been exposed again by the Hong Kong "Wah Shang Pao." The report stated: From the day the Kuomintang government entered Taiwan with the assistance of the US military, the United States began constructing military works in Taiwan. The Zuoying naval and air base (near Xiong), built according to a Japanese ten-year plan, is being repaired under US military supervision. The Taichung US air base is also nearing completion. Local people widely believe that American B-29 Superfortress bombers have appeared at these airfields. The report stated that the Taiwan Cement Factory and the Lead Factory, considered the largest in the Orient, are both controlled by the United States, with most of the technicians and managers being Americans. It also said that the United States is relocating Japanese people to Taiwan for their own purposes. The report is convinced that the Chiang Kai-shek government has signed a secret treaty with the United States to sell out Taiwan.

　　蒋党卖国证据确凿批准美资侵入华南
  　出卖台湾美蒋签订密约
    【新华社陕北二十日电】魏德迈一度“巡游”广州后，美国帝国主美经济侵入华南已见诸事实。据塔斯社上海十九日电引国民党ＣＣ派报纸“新闻报”讯：国民党政府已批准美国公司组合投资两广，该公司组合将投资于两广二十余企业中，广东投资金额达二亿美元，广西投资金额达五千万美元，款项将由美国进出口银行供给。该公司组织投资将侧重于柳州及粤北电力厂、广西锡工业，及粤桂两省水泥、化学肥料、玻璃、制糖、造纸、纺织、汽车、造船等工厂，将雇用美国技师监督。
    【新华社陕北二十日电】据塔斯社南京十八日电：美国侵略台湾的情形，最近为香港华商报再次揭露。该报称：从国民党政府在美军协助下进入台湾之日起，美国就开始在台湾修建军事工事。按照日本十年计划修建起来的左营海空军基地（临雄附近），正在美军监督之下修理，台中美空军基地亦近完成。当地人民盛传美国超级空中堡垒Ｂ—２９已在这些机场中出现。该报称，被认为东方最大的台湾水泥工厂与铅工厂均归美国掌握，其中大多数技师与管理者都是美人。并说美国为了他们自己的目的，正在移殖日本人于台湾。该报确信蒋介石政府已与美国签订了出卖台湾的密约。
