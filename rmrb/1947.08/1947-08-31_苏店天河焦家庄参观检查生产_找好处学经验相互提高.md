Inspection Tour of Production in Su Dian, Tian He, and Jiao Jia Zhuang: Finding Advantages, Learning from Experience, and Improving Together

[This report from Changzhi] The production inspection tour of Su Dian, Tian He, and Jiao Jia Zhuang villages in the Second District, following their first inspection of each village's work on June 4th, conducted a second inspection from August 17th to 19th. Both inspections were very successful. They not only exchanged experiences, promoted progress in lagging villages, and boosted production enthusiasm and confidence, but also advanced the "turning-over" movement. As the masses in Jiao Jia Zhuang said, "If we hadn't learned from Tian He's experience last time, our textile industry wouldn't have developed so quickly." Furthermore, it strengthened the solidarity between farmers and fostered a closer, more respectful, and affectionate relationship among cadres and activists. As Cao Linshui, a "turned-over" hero from Tian He, said, "We have established a close relationship like relatives, exchanging experiences whenever we have them." Everyone felt that participating in an inspection was more effective than a month of training. What contributed to such significant results? There are several key experiences: First, a focus on experience and a mutual learning attitude were adopted, prioritizing the acquisition and exchange of experiences. Therefore, the discovery of an advantage involved repeated analysis through four or five stages: individual exchange of opinions, group study, collective reporting, village discussion, and collective symposium. Lagging villages also discussed how to adopt and learn from those experiences based on their specific circumstances. Because everyone's energy was focused on finding advantages, learning from experience, and improving work, the phenomenon of specifically seeking out shortcomings and finding fault naturally disappeared. Second, a comprehensive inspection method with focused experience research was used. The main purpose of this inspection was to summarize and exchange experiences in equal-value exchange and the consolidation of the three major combinations of mutual aid during the summer harvest and weeding phase, which naturally led to discussions on various aspects such as preferential treatment for military families, resistance to tyranny, supporting the front, participating in the war, reorganizing village finances, textile cooperatives, etc. For example, when Su Dian was weeding, they couldn't send people out for errands. Labor hero Bi Eryun and the cadres studied and came up with a system of dividing labor and animal power, with one-tenth of a work unit being eight "jin" of rice. Those who went on errands received rice, while those who didn't provided rice or returned labor. When they arrived at Jiao Jia Zhuang, the first problem they encountered was the difficulty of preferential treatment for military families. Su Dian introduced its experience: calculating work units based on the distance and difficulty of resisting tyranny, issuing work tickets at once, and allowing military families to use them freely. Saving work units allowed them to earn rice, which increased the production enthusiasm of military families. This solved a major problem for Jiao Jia Zhuang. Third, flexible and in-depth working methods were employed. Although the team members had a general division of labor, such as who would attend meetings and who would conduct individual interviews, there was great flexibility. All were motivated to establish merit for reporting achievements and contributions. They leveraged relationships with relatives and friends to conduct in-depth visits and inspections among various groups, families, and individuals, gaining accurate and rich understanding of the issues. Fourth, progress was compared, achievements were recognized, morale was encouraged, and lagging areas were helped based on the different work foundations of each village. The cadres and masses in Jiao Jia Zhuang were afraid of being laughed at during the inspection because of their poor textile technology. In addition, military families were complaining about the poor treatment. Hero Cao Linshui realized this and praised Jiao Jia Zhuang's progress in developing textiles, exceeding ten households per machine, and the achievement of adding a soybean oil press to the oil mill at the symposium. He stated that their work had substance and progress was rapid, and that if they paid attention to improving technology, they would soon surpass Tian He. The political director of Jiao Jia Zhuang said, "Not only is the technology low, but there may be shortcomings in the equal-value labor exchange. We must learn from Tian He!" Fifth, there was a spirit of mutual and humble learning. During this inspection, everyone was learning from each other's strengths. Cao Linshui said, "After seeing Jiao Jia Zhuang last time, we opened an oil mill. This time, we will also add a soybean oil press." After the summary, Cao Linshui's method of dividing profits in agricultural and sideline mutual aid, Bi Eryun's method of rewarding women for participating in labor through immediate two-eight profit sharing, Jiao Jia Zhuang's development of oil mills, and Su Dian's comprehensive labor exchange for preferential treatment of military families, support for the front, and participation in the war became the goals of each village. It was decided to conduct another inspection after the autumn harvest to compare achievements and contributions. (Office)

　　苏店天河焦家庄参观检查生产
  　找好处学经验相互提高
    【本报长治讯】二区苏店、天河、焦家庄三村生产参观团，自六月四日第一次参观检查了各村工作以后，又于八月十七到十九日进行第二次参观检查。这两次的参观检查都很成功，不但交流了经验，推动了落后村，提高了生产情绪和信心，而且也推动了前的运动。如焦家庄群众说：“要不是上次观学上南天河的经验，咱们的纺织还能开展的这样快。”而且亲密了农民之间的团结，干部积极分子间更达到互爱互敬密切关系。正像天河翻身英雄曹林水说的：“已经建立和亲戚一样的密切关系，一有经验就互相来往（交流）。”大家共同感觉：参加一次检查，比受一月训还强。什么能收到这么大的成绩呢？有如下几点经验：一、有重视经验互相学习的参观态度，一切为了取得经验，交流经验。所以对一个优点的发现，都要经过个别交换意见，小组研究，集体汇报，分村讨论，集体座谈等四五次的反复分析。落后村还要根据各村的具体情况讨论如何接受与学习那几点经验。因大家的精力都集中到找好处、学经验，如何把工作搞好，所以很自然的没有专门找缺点挑毛病的现象。二、运用了一揽子的检查，有重点的研究经验。此次参观，主要是要总结交流夏收锄苗阶段的等价交换与巩固互助的三大结合等经验，所以很自然的连扯到优抗支差参战整理村财政纺织合作社等各方面。如苏店锄苗时，便派不出差去，劳动英雄毕二云便和干部研究出把劳力畜力订分，十分一工，一工八斤米，多出差的得米，不出差的出米，或还工。到焦家庄首先碰到的是优抗工作困难，苏店就介绍自己经验：把抗地远近好做与否计算出工，一次发给工票，让抗属自由使用，省下工可以得米，这样来提高抗属的生产情绪。这给焦家庄解决了很大问题。三、有灵活深入的工作方式：团员们虽也有概括的分工，如谁去参加开会，谁去个别访问，但都有很大的灵活性，都为了报告时比成绩，比功劳，便发挥了自己的立功积极性，都找到亲戚朋友等关系，深入到各组各家各种人中进行深入的访问检查，了解的问题真实又丰富。四、从各村不同的工作基础上，比进步，表成绩，鼓励情绪，帮助落后。焦家庄的干部群众，因纺织技术差，便很怕参观笑话，加之抗属反映优抗不好，便有些泄气。翻身英雄曹林水看出来，便在座谈会上表扬了焦家庄纺织开展，超过十户一机与油房增加了一盘豆油碾子的成绩，工作有骨头，进步快，如今后注意提高技术，不久会超过天河。焦家庄政治主任说：“不但技术低，等价变工也许有缺点，可得好好向天河学习哩！”五、有互相虚心学习的精神。这次检查，互相都是在学习对方的特长，曹林水说：“上次看了焦家庄，回去开了个油，今次回去也要增加个豆油碾子。”经过总结，曹林水的农副业互助分红办法，毕二云的现过现二八分红奖励妇女参加劳动办法，焦家庄发展油房，苏店优抗代耕支差参战全村大变工办法，已成为各村的奋斗目标，并决定秋后再次检查，比成绩比功劳。（办公室）
