Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 23rd—Under the corrupt rule of Chiang Kai-shek's bureaucratic clique, embezzlement and illegal incidents emerge endlessly. According to recent reports from various sources: The Chiang-controlled Hankou Goods Tax Bureau has illegally extorted inspection fees for tobacco, alcohol, sugar, flour, and cotton yarn since November of last year, with the estimated total reaching 4 billion yuan. Tian Mengjia, the director of the Chiang-controlled Henan Cooperative Enterprise Management Office, embezzled public funds for personal gain, misappropriating over 15 million yuan; after the incident was exposed, the Chiang-controlled Henan Provincial Government attempted to cover it up, which aroused dissatisfaction from all sectors, leading to accusations. A major corruption case also occurred in the Chiang-controlled Zhejiang Provincial Highway Bureau on the 4th of last month. The Chiang-controlled Executive Yuan's Zhejiang branch issued 3,600 bags of flour for the construction of the Linhai Highway. The bureau planned to privately transport 2,370 of these bags from Ningbo to Shanghai by ship for sale, but they were discovered and seized by UNRRA personnel. According to Kuomintang official sources, in the middle of this month, more than 20 embezzlement cases were exposed, involving Zhang Minggang, the director of the Chiang-controlled Hankou Social Service Center, and Shi Guofan, the director of the Chiang-controlled Henan Health Department.
