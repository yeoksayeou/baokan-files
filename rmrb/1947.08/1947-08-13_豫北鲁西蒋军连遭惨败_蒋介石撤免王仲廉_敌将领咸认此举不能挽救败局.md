　　Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 11th: News from the Western Shandong front: Wang Zhonglian, commander of the reorganized 26th Army, who was dispatched from Northern Henan to aid Western Shandong, has been dismissed by Chiang Kai-shek due to the disastrous defeat in Western Shandong. The 40th Division under Wang's command was wiped out in November of the year before last, his 3rd Division was wiped out in September of last year, and his 49th Brigade (2nd Rapid Column) was wiped out in April of this year; although the above units have been replenished, their combat effectiveness has declined. The only 32nd Division that has not been wiped out and Song Ruike's 66th Division, a direct line of Chen Cheng, which has been under his command since April of this year, were also completely annihilated in Western Shandong this time. Wang Zhonglian is the eighth senior Chiang army commander to be punished for ineffective civil war. Before him, those who were punished included Liu Zhi, former director of the Zhengzhou Pacification Headquarters (dismissed for the failure of the Longhai Campaign in September last year), Xue Yue, director of the Xuzhou Pacification Headquarters (dismissed for the failure in Southern Shandong in January this year), Shangguan Yunxiang, deputy director of the Baoding Pacification Headquarters (given a major demerit in April this year for the failure to suppress and剿 the Jidong area), Hou Jingru, director of the Jidong Military Region and commander of the 92nd Army (same as above), Tang Enbo, director of the Linyi Command Post of the Army Headquarters (dismissed for the annihilation of the 74th Division in Central Shandong in May this year), Li Tianxia, commander of the 1st Column of the 1st Corps of Shandong (same as above), and Du Yuming, commander-in-chief of the Northeast Security Headquarters (ordered to "go abroad for medical treatment" due to the failure of the Northeast Chiang army in May and June this year). In addition, there were many division and brigade commanders who were dismissed, reprimanded, and given demerits, including Song Ruike, the commander of the 66th Division who was captured in Western Shandong this time (he and another division commander, Wu Tinglin, were reprimanded by Chiang Kai-shek for the failure of their "plan" to attack our Central Plains Liberated Area in the summer of last year, and two division commanders were dismissed at the same time). Chiang army generals believe that these punishments are unfair and ineffective. For example, after the 74th Division was annihilated, Li Tianxia, the commander of the 83rd Division under Tang Enbo, was not only dismissed but also put on trial; while Tang Enbo, who was more responsible, was promoted to deputy commander-in-chief of the army in charge of operations. Tang has always been a notorious loser in the War of Resistance Against Japan and the domestic war, but because he is a confidant of Chiang, he is "glorified even in defeat." Xue Yue's dismissal and Gu Zhutong's promotion also aroused similar comments. In the failure of the Chiang army in Northeast China, Du Yuming, who had a shallow relationship with the United States, was dismissed, while Sun Liren, the former commander of the New 1st Army, who had a deep relationship with the United States, was promoted to second deputy commander-in-chief of the army in charge of training. This matter particularly aroused the feeling of national subjugation among Chiang army officers, because although Sun Liren is familiar to American soldiers, he is not familiar to Chinese soldiers, and the New 1st Army he commanded has lost more than half of its strength in Northeast China, proving that his military talent does not exceed Du Yuming. A whisper is now beginning to circulate among most Chiang army officers, believing that the first person who should be dismissed is Chiang Kai-shek, because Chiang has made fundamental errors in both politics and military affairs, and refuses to correct them, which makes it impossible for his subordinates to avoid failure.

　　豫北鲁西蒋军连遭惨败
    蒋介石撤免王仲廉
  　敌将领咸认此举不能挽救败局
    【新华社陕北十一日电】鲁西前线息：由豫北驰援鲁西的整编二十六军军长王仲廉，已因鲁西惨败被蒋介石撤职。王部原辖第四十师曾于前年十一月被歼，其第三师曾于去年九月被歼，其第四十九旅（第二快速纵队）曾于今年四月被歼；以上各部虽经补充，但战力已低下；其唯一未被歼的第三十二师与从今年四月起受其指挥的陈诚嫡系六十六师宋瑞珂部，此次亦在鲁西被歼干净。王仲廉是因内战不力受处罚的第八个蒋军高级指挥官，在他以前被处罚的有前郑州绥署主任刘峙（因去年九月陇海战役失败被撤职）、徐州绥署主任薛岳（因今年一月鲁南失败撤职）、保定绥署副主任上官云相（今年四月因清剿冀东失败记大过）、冀东绥区主任兼九十二军军长侯镜如（同上）、陆军总部临沂指挥所主任汤恩伯（因今年五月七十四师在鲁中被歼撤职）、山东第一兵团第一纵队司令兼八十三师师长李天霞（同上），与东北保安司令长官杜聿明（因今年五、六月东北蒋军失败奉命“出洋治病”）。此外尚有被撤职、申斥、记过的师旅长多人，包括此次在鲁西被俘的六十六师师长宋瑞珂（他与另一师长武庭麟在去年夏季均因进攻我中原解放区“计划”失败受蒋介石申斥，同时有两个师长被撤职）。蒋军将领认为这些处罚是不公平和无效的，例如七十四师被歼后，汤恩伯统率的八十三师师长李天霞不但被撤职，且受审判；而负更大责任的汤恩伯则被提升为掌管作战的陆军副总司令。汤在抗日战争与国内战争中从来是声名狼籍的败将，但因系蒋的亲信，“虽败犹荣”。薛岳撤职、顾祝同升官亦引起同样的评论，在东北蒋军的失败中，与美国关系浅的杜聿明被撤职，与美国关系深的前新一军军长孙立人则被高升为掌管训练的陆军第二副总司令，此事特别引起蒋军军官的亡国奴感觉，因为孙立人虽为美国军人所熟悉，却不为中国军人所熟悉，而且他所指挥的新一军在东北已损失一半以上，证明他的军队才能并不超过杜聿明。蒋军多数军官中现在开始流行一种耳语，认为第一个应被撤职的乃是蒋介石，因为蒋在政治上和军事上都犯了根本错误，而又不肯纠正，才使他的部下非失败不可。
