　　People's Merit, Army Role Model: 20th Unit Celebrates Heroes
　　[Our Newspaper] The first Hero Congress of the 20th Unit of the Taihang People's Liberation Army opened on August 11th. That morning, 211 heroes and model workers, led by military bands from their respective units, accompanied by long Yangko dance teams, were joyfully sent to the Hero Hall for the congress. At 8:00 AM, the leaders of the 20th Unit visited the heroes, shaking hands with each one and presenting them with notebooks and pencils, encouraging them to study hard. At 10:00 AM, the ribbon-cutting ceremony for the Exhibition Hall of the 20th Unit's military achievements was held, with heroes and guests being the first to visit. Among the exhibits, the two field guns captured in the Battle of Loving Fight, the many American weapons captured in the Battle of Chenbao, the comic strip of the unit's development history, the march route map, the comics of heroes and model companies, and the soldiers' woodcuts, comics, and door-panel newspapers were especially noted by the heroes. In the afternoon, the entire army gathered at the congress venue. At 3:00 PM, the hero contingent, led by the banner "Defenders of the People," entered the venue, facing the soaring Pegasus Warrior statue above the rostrum. At 3:40 PM, the grand congratulatory ceremony began, with dozens of Yangko dance teams, hundreds of congratulatory flags, and countless慰劳品 (consolation goods) entering the venue one after another. Director Dou first delivered the opening speech, reporting the 20th Unit's brilliant achievements of annihilating 4,700 enemies in the seven months since the victory at Zhaojia Factory and the launch of the mutual assistance and meritorious service campaign. He pointed out that the spirit of the congress was to summarize experiences, improve ourselves, prepare our strength, and welcome the great counter-offensive; he called on the heroes to make resolutions, set plans, and strive for the entire brigade to become a meritorious brigade in the counter-offensive. After the speech, music rose again, and 40 liberated women presented flowers to the heroes. Then, Political Commissar Yu, on behalf of the Brigade Party Committee, congratulated the heroes, made a concise analysis of the current war situation, and called on the entire army to study Chairman Mao's tactical thinking. When the guests spoke, the representatives of the Taihang Administrative Office, Commissioner Du of the Fourth Administrative Office, representatives of the Fourth Prefectural Committee, County Head of Bo'ai Mi, and representatives of the Fifth Administrative Office successively gave speeches, all expressing their sincere intention to intensify production, take care of military families, thoroughly carry out land reform, and fully support the front line. It was already 8:00 PM when the heroes spoke. Under the light of the gas lamps, Chen Qigui, the model instructor of the 203rd Regiment, was the first to speak: he announced on the spot that the Ninth Company he led would capture six machine guns, 70 rifles, and capture 100 enemies in the next six months, and guarantee the handover of materials to the public. Li Quande, a combat hero of the 205th Regiment, said: I was liberated in the Huixian battle last August. Under the leadership of the Communist Party, I became a hero. My home is more than 2,000 li away. I am determined to fight back to my hometown in the great counter-offensive and liberate the land and people south of the Yellow River. When Comrade Zhang Yuheng, the model reconnaissance platoon leader of the 208th Regiment, came to the stage to speak, he was extremely excited and shouted: "Director Dou said that heroes are the locomotives. I hope that next time our brigade will have 2,000 locomotives, and we will all drive together to rush towards Chiang Kai-shek and be sure to crush him." After the free speeches, the Pioneer Theater performed the 20th Unit's hero allegro and the opera "Double Happiness Comes to the Door, Reporting Meritorious Service," as a celebration. (Di Qian)
