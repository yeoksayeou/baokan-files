Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 31st: According to a United Press report on the 27th: Non-partisan Chinese merchants in Shanghai stated: Chinese merchants all long for peace and unity, and the abolition of all improper and excessive taxes. They also hinted at their opposition to U.S. aid to Chiang's civil war, and demanded that "they be able to do business peacefully and quietly and seek legitimate profits." They condemned: "The government's (referring to the Chiang government) restrictions on merchants are so trivial, so sudden and so frequently changed, making business difficult and creating opportunities for bureaucratic corruption. Merchants asserted that the various taxes of the Chiang government can never be paid off. For example, the Chiang-controlled Zhejiang provincial authorities levy taxes on pigs before the ham is made, taxes are levied when the ham is made and transported out, and business tax is levied when it is transported to Shanghai, and a stamp tax must be affixed to the invoice for each item sold. Merchants believe that these heavy taxes are used by the Chiang government as military expenses for carrying out the civil war, and if the civil war stops, these taxes can be greatly reduced. They also expressed deep dissatisfaction with the Chiang government's use of privileges to 'take over' and open a large number of factories and enterprises formerly operated by the Japanese, forming a serious 'competition' that suffocates private enterprises. They said: Taking the cotton textile industry as an example, China Textile Corporation, one of the Chiang government's monopoly institutions, can promote and sell its products to Hong Kong and other places with high profits, while restricting the export of products from private factories."

    付不清蒋政府内战军费
    沪商谴责捐税繁重
    【新华社陕北三十一日电】据合众社二十七日讯：上海无党派的中国商人表示：中国商人均渴望和平团结，取消一切不正当的苛捐杂税。并暗示反对美国援蒋内战，而要求“他们能和平，平静的做生意寻找合法利润。”他们谴责称：“政府（指蒋政府）对商人的束缚是如此琐碎，如此突然和经常的改变着，使商业遭受到困难，同时造成官僚腐败的机会。商人们断言蒋政府各种各样的捐税是永不能付清的，例如蒋记浙江省当局在火腿未制前要收猪的税，火腿制成运出时又要收税，而运到上海又要收营业税，而且在每一件商品出售时还要在发票上贴印花税票。商人们相信这些繁重捐税都被蒋政府利用作为进行内战的军费去了，如果内战停止，这些捐税可大为减轻。他们对蒋政府利用特权‘劫收’并开办了以前日本经营的大量工厂企业，形成窒死私人企业的严重‘竞争’一事亦深表不满。他们说：以棉纺织业为例，蒋政府垄断机构之一的中纺公司可以厚利推销出品到香港及其他地方，而对私人工厂出品的出口则加以限制。”
