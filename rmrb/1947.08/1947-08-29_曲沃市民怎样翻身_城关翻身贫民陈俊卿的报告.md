How Can Quwo Citizens Overthrow Their Oppressors?
　　A Report from Chen Junqing, a Liberated Poor Resident of Chengguan
　　Wei Jin
　　Chen Junqing, a leader of the liberated poor in Quwo's Xiguan, reports on how to ignite the flames of struggle in areas where the enemy has long ruled and the masses have great concerns.

　　　　(1) Who Made Us Live This Bitter Life?

　　There are over two hundred households in Chengguan's North Street, most of us from Jiyuan and Shandong. Since drifting here, we haven't a single room of our own, nor even a single mu of land. We rely on selling water, oil, and vegetables to make a living; it's truly hard. Setting up a small stall with meager capital means paying taxes and levies several times over, and also being drafted for errands. And that's not all; there are also the vampire landlords. They are mostly landlords and local bullies, who also hold some public office, like section chiefs, street chiefs, and errand officers. With money and power, they arbitrarily extort from us. Everyone knows that, living in the city, a house is as important as land is to a farmer. The landlords seize on this point, always renting us dilapidated houses, making us pay to repair them, saying they won't increase the rent later, or sometimes we pay the next month's rent in advance. But as soon as they find someone who will pay more, they kick us out. They also extort from us in secret daily. For example, some landlords run oil presses, and if you happen to be pushing a small sesame oil mill, the landlord will set rental terms like: "No rent, just give me the 'masheng' (oil cakes)." A small mill produces about twenty jin of "masheng" a month, worth over seven hundred yuan, but the rent is only sixty or seventy yuan. Think of how much a renter would lose! And that's not counting serving the landlord without pay every day! Carrying water, washing clothes, mixing coal, chopping firewood, sweeping, grinding, and so on, are all our jobs.

　　In North Street, those who have forced us to live this bitter life for many years are the landlords Wang Zicheng, Dong Chengxian, Gong Ziren, and others.

　　　　(2) The Poor Unite, Grasp the "Crucial Points."

　　After the city was opened, the Eighth Route Army traded fairly, and we dared to talk in twos and threes. But talking about struggle was still a long way off. When a cadre walked into someone's house, others would gossip, saying: "The Eighth Route Army went to his house, I don't know what they said, I dare not talk to him."

　　The cadre and I first met in the field outside the city. Why did I dare to meet with the cadre? Because during the famine years, I came from my hometown of Jiyuan and worked with our troops for a few days. At that time, the cadre asked me what my troubles were and whether I dared to fight. I said: "The landlords have been extorting us these past few years, I haven't had a good day. How can I not dare to fight? Even if things change in the future, my only possession is a vegetable-selling shoulder pole, what am I afraid of?" After that, I contacted my three good friends, Niu Gedong, Li Fusheng, and Sun Jiaoyu, and we worked separately to carry out the work—the poor uniting with the poor. How to unite? It was truly not easy. City people—especially people like us, who are running around for a living every day—even though we've lived next to each other for three or five years and see each other often, we rarely talk. Now, suddenly talking to them, people would definitely be suspicious. Later, through our vegetable-selling connections, we finally got the chance to talk. Suffering people naturally can't help but shed tears when talking to other sufferers, but when it comes to fighting the landlords, that's not easy. People like us, living in the city, have active minds, are cunning, and have been ruled by the enemy for eight or nine years, so our worries are great. If you get through to him about this fear today, another fear will come out tomorrow. In short, every time you speak, you have to bring up a "fear." How to eliminate this "fear"? That is, to grasp the other person's "crucial point." A few days ago, I talked to Li Xiaoqi's sister-in-law. She said she was afraid of things changing. I explained it to her for a while. Then she said she was afraid of losing her conscience. I said, "Didn't you say it's only twenty days until the wheat harvest? When you borrowed wheat from the landlord, he said, 'Eat a dou, pay back one and a half dous.' Later, he said, 'Eat a dou, pay back one dou for the principal and another one and a half dous for interest.' You borrowed two dous of wheat from him, and ended up paying back five dous with interest! Think of how many days you worked for him for nothing, and he still swindled you like that. Doesn't he lose his conscience?" This really angered her, and she said she wanted to fight. But then she hurriedly told me: "These words are for you, don't tell anyone else." A few days later, I talked to her again. She said she was afraid of offending the landlord and being kicked out in the future. At this time, I thought calmly: this is indeed a big problem. I solemnly told her: "Now everyone is going to fight the landlord Wang Zicheng. If you don't fight, when his house is divided, where will you live?" This made her very anxious, and she said: "If that happens, our family will have nowhere to live." I said: "As long as you dare to fight, you can get a house, and also clothes, furniture, etc. Isn't this a good thing!" For poor people like us, the first thing is to have a place to live, and the second is to get back some useful things, because we have nothing at home. When the other party heard that there were so many benefits to the struggle, they immediately said they were willing to fight. Even her brother—Li Xiaoqi, who had been bullied for years and dared not say a word—said: "If we can get these things, I dare to fight." In this way, we contacted a total of fourteen poor households, and the target of the struggle was all the landlord Wang Zicheng.

　　　　(3) Dig Up Hidden Goods and Fight the Oil Press.

　　We struggled against Wang Zicheng in early July. He exploited us severely. Everyone wanted to really fight this scoundrel, but during the struggle, some people couldn't argue with him, and others didn't dare to help. We should have beaten him up, but he only got a few slaps. What's the reason? Because we didn't understand democracy. We only knew that the Eighth Route Army preached leniency, and we didn't dare to fight Wang Zicheng too hard. Later, the higher-ups learned about this and explained: "If he is a scoundrel, you should fight him as you see fit. Be bold, nothing will happen!" Only then did we understand that the democracy the Eighth Route Army talked about was letting the common people be the masters. So, the second time we struggled against Dong Chengxian (a landlord and local bully), it was different. He tried to escape the struggle. He falsely claimed that he had sold a house next door to a relative surnamed Yang, and secretly hid grain and other valuables there. Then he said to us: "Look! There's nothing left, fight me!" He looked very cocky. But we didn't let him off easily. We asked him: "Where is the sales contract? Who are the witnesses?" He said the contract had rotted in the ground and the witnesses were dead. Wasn't this nonsense?! We tied him up without ceremony and asked what was going on with that Yang fellow. Seeing the situation was not good, Yang honestly said that Dong Chengxian had lent him the house. So the truth came out. We confiscated his house and dug up the hidden goods. Then we struggled against Gong Ziren (a landlord and local bully). He ran an oil press. Hearing that we wouldn't struggle against industry and commerce, he moved all his property into the oil press. But his oil press was also exploiting the poor through rent, so we confiscated the oil press without ceremony and dug up the hidden things. In this way, each time we struggled, we were more energetic than the last. Now the struggle is expanding from North Street to East, West, and South Streets.

　　曲沃市民怎样翻身
  　城关翻身贫民陈俊卿的报告
    维进
    曲沃西关翻身贫民领袖陈俊卿，报告怎样在敌人长期统治群众顾虑很大的地区，燃起斗争的烈火。
    　　　　（一）谁使我们过这个苦日子？
    城关北街有二百余户，大部是我们济源人和山东人，自流浪到这里，房无一间，地无一亩，依靠卖水、卖油、卖菜等过日子，真不好过。摆个小摊，小本钱，一年上税派款就要多好几倍，又要编组支差。这且不说，还有吸血鬼房东，他们大部是经营地主兼恶霸，又干点公事，什么科长、街长、差务主任，有钱又有势，便任意敲榨人。谁都知道，生活在城市里，房子好比农民的土地一样的重要。房东抓住这点，总是租给我们破房，叫我们掏钱修好房子，说的以后不增加房租，或有时我们预先掏了下月房钱。但他们一遇见多出房租的人，就会把我们赶走。日常还要暗敲榨，比如有些房东是开油坊的，你又是推小磨香油的，房东就会提出租房的条件：“不收房租，麻生（即油饼）给我。”一座小磨，每月约出“麻生”二十斤，共值七百多元，但是房租每月才六七十元，你想租房的人，要吃多少亏。这还不算，每天无报酬的侍候房东才够受哩！担水、洗衣、和煤、劈柴、扫、推磨等等，都是我们的事情。
    在北街多年迫着我们过着这个苦日子的，就是房东王子成、董成贤、宫子仁等。
    　　　　（二）苦人联苦人，要抓“紧要事关”。
    打开城，八路军公平买卖，我们敢三三两两在一起谈话。可是说起斗争，还差得远。干部走进那一家，别人就在议论着说：“八路军到他家，不知说什么了，可不敢跟他说话。”
    干部和我第一次见面，是在城外的地里。我为什么敢和干部见面？原来灾荒年我从老家济源出来，在咱的队伍干过几天，当时干部问我有什么苦，敢干不？我说：“这几年房东敲榨没有好过一天，怎么不敢干，即使将来天变，我的家当就是一条卖菜扁担，怕什么？”这以后，我就联络牛各东、李福生、孙教育三个相好的，共同分头进行工作——苦人联合苦人。怎样联？真个不容易，城里人——特别是我们这号人，天天为生活奔波的人，虽然已经同居三年五载常见面，都很少说过话的，现在突然跟他们谈话，人家一定怀疑。后来通过卖菜的关系，才得到谈话的机会。受苦人对苦人自然不免伤心流泪，但是提到跟房东干，那就不容易。我们这号人，生活在城市，脑筋活，心眼多，又给敌人统治八九年，顾虑可大。你今天打通他这个怕的思想，明天又出来那个怕的思想，总之每次说话都要说出一个“怕”。怎样取消这个“怕”，这就是摸住对方“紧要事关”的地方。头几天，我跟李小齐的兄弟媳妇谈话，她说怕天变，我又给她解释了一番；她又说，怕丧良心，我说“你不是说过离收麦只有二十天，你借房东的麦时，他说的‘吃一斗还一斗五升’，后来他却说‘吃一斗还一斗本，再还一斗五升作利’，你借人家二斗麦，结果连本带利，还了五斗，你想你平日不知给他白做多少活，他还这样诈你，他就不丧良心？”这样他真的生了气，表示要干但是一会他又忙给我说：“这话是对你说的，可不敢告别人。”再过几天，我又找他说话，她又说：怕得罪房东，将来被赶。这时我冷静考虑了一遍，的确是一个大问题。就郑重的告她说：“现在大家要斗房东王子成，你要不干，将来把他的房子分了，你往那里住？”这一来他十分焦急的说：“要这咱一家没处活了”。我又说：“只要你敢干，你就能分下房，还要分下衣服家具等等，这不是好事情！”我们这号穷人，头一件就是要求有房住，再一件因为家中甚都没有，就是要求算回点能用的东西。对方听说到斗争有这许多好处，马上表示愿干，连她的哥——长年受欺侮不敢说一句话的李小齐，也说：“要能分到这些东西，敢干。”这样我们一共联络了十四户苦人，斗争对象都是房东王子成。
    　　　　（三）刨了内藏又斗油坊。
    七月初斗争王子成，他敲榨我们可不轻。对于这个坏蛋，本来大家要好好斗的，但是斗争的时候，有的人说不过他，别人还不大敢去帮忙。应该打他一顿，结果才打了几个耳光。这是什么道理？因为我们摸不清民主，只知道八路军讲宽大，不敢把王子成斗得太厉害。后来上级知道这件事情，就解释说：“是坏蛋，你们该怎么斗就怎么斗，大胆的干，没有事情！”我们才清楚八路军讲民主，就是让老百姓去作主，这样第二次斗董成贤（经营地主兼恶霸），就不一样。他打逃避斗争，把旁边一座房子，假说已经卖给姓杨的亲戚，悄悄把粮食内货都藏到那里，于是给我们说：“瞧！没甚了，斗吧！”样子很神气；但是我们就不把他轻放。问他：“卖房的文约在那里？中人是谁？”他说将文约埋烂了，中人死了，这不是胡说？！我们不客气的把他绑起来，又问那个姓杨的是怎么回事，杨见势不对，老实说出这房子是董成贤借给他住的，于是事情弄明白了，我们把他的房子没收，把内货刨了。接着我们又斗了宫子仁（经营地主兼恶霸）。他开一座油房，听说不斗工商业，便把家产都搬到那房里去；但是他的油坊也是剥削穷人房租来的，我们不客气的把油房没收了，把埋藏的东西刨出来。就这样，我们一次比一次斗的有劲。现在斗争正从北街扩大到东、西、南三街。（太岳分社）
