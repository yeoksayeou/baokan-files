　　"This is as Important as Fighting a War"
  　A Record of the Exemplary Flood Prevention and Risk Management Company

　　The water level was constantly rising, and the rapid flow at the Wangzhuang dangerous section not only severely eroded the five dams but also gradually impacted the dike's foundation. The Flood Prevention Bureau decided to dump stones below the five dams and organize forces to rebuild three new dams to prevent accidents. The Second Company of a certain unit of the ×× troops stationed nearby, upon hearing that Wangzhuang was in severe danger, expressed to their superiors their desire to participate in flood prevention and risk management. "Old Jiang wants to flood the liberated areas, but we will never let the Yellow River break its banks. This is as important as fighting a war. If the Yellow River flood isn't controlled, it will be hard to have a good life."

　　On August 2nd, the second day the project began, this contingent of the people's soldiers joyfully arrived at the Wangzhuang dike. The entire company, organized according to the dike construction structure, was divided into three groups: soil carrying, straw material carrying, and stone dumping. After a brief mobilization, they began to act in a combat-ready posture. At the same time, their door panel newspaper appeared under the willow trees. One article wrote: "Open your mouth and talk about Old Jiang, losing soldiers and generals, his heart unwilling, wholeheartedly wanting to release the Yellow River, leaving no one to drown. The military and civilians work together to repair the dam, protecting lives and property, repairing the dam to save ourselves, we cannot be lazy or idle." Following the publication of the door panel newspaper, the Second Company's commanders and fighters seized the opportunity to conduct dike repair and risk management education among the dike workers. Immediately afterward, Ma Leizhao, a soldier from the stone dumping group, took the lead, "moving big ones, running fast," quickly setting off a competitive upsurge of not yielding to each other. Before it was even time for a break, the second issue of the door panel newspaper was published: "If you ask who moves the biggest, praise Shi Yongjiu, Ma Sikai's wasn't small, and Yu Fuxi's wasn't either, and there's one below, the biggest is the company commander!" Everyone's enthusiasm grew stronger and stronger, carrying stakes, hauling sorghum stalks, dumping stones, and pushing earth, no one was slacking off. Especially the stone dumping group, carrying bigger and bigger stones, running faster and faster. Soldiers Yang Ruzun and Wang Qunjin carried a 300-jin boulder together. Some fell, some broke their hands and feet, and even the cooks refused to be left behind. Deputy squad leader Cui Jiazhu and cook Qin Chuandian and others, after preparing the meals, also participated in this glorious work, running back and forth, their clothes completely soaked with sweat. Under the influence of the Second Company's exemplary actions, the morale of all the dike workers was also greatly boosted. Some said, "The Eighth Route Army is so good, they are working even harder than us, if we don't work hard, we'll have a guilty conscience!" Some said, "Logically, the army only fights, dike construction is our people's business, but they have their shoulders pressed red, if we 'drag our feet' we'd really be letting them down!"

　　“这和打仗一样重要”
  　记防泛整险模范连
    水位不断的上涨，汪庄险工的大流，不仅严重的冲刷着五坝，且已逐渐撞到堤根。泛防局决定一面在五坝下青抛石，一面组织力量，重建三道新坝，以防出险。在附近驻防的××部二连，听说汪庄险象严重，便向上级表示，要求参加防泛整险。“老蒋想水淹解放区，咱们就决不让黄河开口，这和打仗一样重要，黄泛治不住，好光景也难过好。”
    八月二日，工程开始的第二天，这一支人民的子弟兵，便兴高彩烈的开上了汪庄大堤，全连按照堤工的组织，分区抬土、托秸料、抛石三组，经过简短的动员，便以战斗的姿态行动起来。同时，在柳荫下出现了他们的门板报。有一篇写道：“开口来把老蒋谈，损兵折将心不甘，一心要把黄河放，一个不留把咱淹。军民动手齐修坝，生命财产得保全，修坝为的救自己，不能耍滑光偷闲。”随着门板报的出版，二连指战员抓紧时机，在堤工中进行复堤整险教育，紧接着抛石组战士马雷召首先带头，“搬大的、跑快步”，很快的便掀起了互不相让的竞赛热潮。还不到休息的时候，第二期门板报出版了：“你问那个搬的大，就把师永久来夸，马思凯的不算小，俞福西也不在下，还有一个在下边，最大就是连长呀！”大家的劲头越来越大，搬桩、托秫秸、抛石、推土，没有一个耍滑头的。特别是抛石组，越抬越大，越跑越快。战士杨如尊、王群金两个人抬了三百斤的大石头。有的摔倒了，有的碰破了手脚，就连炊事班都不甘落后，副班长崔家珠和炊事员秦传典等人在做好饭之后，一样参加这光荣的工作，往返奔驰，汗把衣服全部湿透了。在二连模范行动影响下，全体堤工的情绪也更为振作，有的说：“八路军真好，人家比咱干的还凶，咱再不好好干，亏良心！”有的说：“按理军队光打仗，打堤是咱老百姓的事，人家一个个肩膀压的通红，咱要‘拖滑’真是对不住他们！”　　（长风）
