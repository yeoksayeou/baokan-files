Xinhua News Agency, Shandong, 14th. A correspondent of this branch office summarizing the Bohai re-examination movement reports: The new instructions of the East China Bureau of the CPC regarding land reform are now being thoroughly implemented in the villages. The district party committee and local party committees are personally going into the base areas to create experience, and more than 80% of the cadres from the party, government, and civilian systems are投入投入 into the re-examination. The broad masses are overjoyed. A poor peasant in the first district of Zhanhua reflected: "Now that the decree (referring to the new instructions) has been issued, we have the right to manage the landlords and feudal forces!" An old poor man in the fourth district of Yangxin was ecstatic upon hearing that a thorough reckoning was to be carried out, and repeatedly shouted: "Down with Wang Haijia's feudal forces!" At present, a surge has been set off in counties and cities such as Zhanhua, Putai, Yangxin, and Huimin. The hidden landlord and feudal forces within Huimin City are also being thoroughly reckoned by the masses. Eighty percent of the women in the first district of Zhanhua are involved in the movement, and martial law is implemented in each village to prevent sabotage activities by landlords. Farmers in Putai have also established pickets to protect the re-examination process. This movement exhibits the following characteristics: First, in addition to the government firmly backing the masses and suppressing reactionary forces, a ideological revolution is launched within various systems to eliminate landlord and rich peasant ideology, and to change minds and positions. Individual cadres who persist in the landlord stance after education and persuasion are purged. Second, a new policy of thoroughly eliminating the landlord class and mobilizing the masses with the poor and hired peasants as the core is implemented, correcting the past mistake of prioritizing the interests of landlords. Cadres in Huimin City reflected on their past failure to focus on mobilizing the poor and hired peasants, saying: "If the root is planted wrong, the movement will naturally not be successful!" Now they have realized that the opinions put forward by the poor and hired peasants are often the opinions of 90% of the farmers, so they must focus on selecting and cultivating the poor and hired peasant components as activists. Third, the work style of cadres has begun to change. However, in their work, many counties and districts have failed to truly implement the mass line, and there are shortcomings such as mechanically stipulating deadlines for completing tasks, paternalistic work styles, and new complacency and paralysis among cadres, which are now being actively corrected and overcome.

　　渤海各地深入复查
    【新华社山东十四日电】分社记者综述渤海复查运动称：中共华东局土地改革新指示现已深入乡村贯彻执行中，区党委及各地委均亲自深入基点创造经验，党政民各系统均以百分之八十以上干部投入复查。广大群众欣喜万状，沾化一区贫农反映：“令箭（指新指示）下来，咱们有权管地主封建势力了！”阳信四区一个穷老汉听到要彻底清算，兴奋如狂，不时大喊：“打倒王海家封建势力！”现沾化、蒲台、阳信及惠民等县市已掀起热潮。惠民城内以各种方式隐蔽之地主封建势力，现也正被群众彻底清算。沾化一区妇女百分之八十卷入运动，各村并实行戒严，以防止地主破坏活动，蒲台农民并成立纠察队，保护复查进行。此次运动表现以下几个特点：一、除政府坚决为群众撑腰镇压反动势力外，并发动在各系统中进行肃清地主富农思想，展开换脑筋换立场的思想革命，经教育说服而仍坚持地主立场的个别干部，则予以清洗。二、实行彻底取消地主阶级，以雇贫为核心发动群众的新方针，纠正了过去先照顾地主的错误方针。惠民市干部反省过去未着重发动雇贫说：“根子插错了，运动自然搞不好！”现在他们已体会到雇贫农提出的意见常常也就是百分之九十农民的意见，故积极分子一定要着重选择培养雇贫成份。三、干部作风已开始转变。惟尚有不少县区在工作中未能真正贯彻群众路线，存在着机械规定完成任务期限，包办代替作风及干部间产生的新的自满麻痹情绪等缺点，现正积极纠正克服中。
