(Jilu Yu Daily News, 7th) The day after Yuncheng was recovered, the deputy platoon leader of the communications platoon and a cavalry communicator, Wang Xinyan, from one of our units went to the Yan Shiko area for reconnaissance. When they reached a patch of lush green field south of Zhen Village, three miles from Yan Shiko, a farmer who was hoeing the field suddenly put down his hoe and told them with fear and affection, "There are thirty-odd Kuomintang soldiers in the village!" They were overjoyed to hear this. At that time, it was decided that the deputy platoon leader would go back to report to the unit, and Wang Xinyan would stay here to monitor the enemy. Hiding in the sorghum field, Wang Xinyan was very anxious, standing up to look around for a while, and then squatting down to think quietly. Communicators Huang Youming and Zhang Gangxian happened to pass by here on official business. The three of them immediately got together and held a "Zhuge Liang meeting", deciding to use a feint attack and "bluff" tactics to eliminate the enemy. After the plan was decided, they quietly went to a sorghum field dozens of meters west of the village and fired several shots towards the street. Then they quickly went around to the west of the village from the south and rushed into the village bravely. A group of Chiang's troops had just gathered together and were preparing to flee to the west of the village when this unexpected attack threw them into chaos. They shouted, "No, no, there's an ambush in the west!" and hurriedly turned back, preparing to return to their original positions to hold on. However, these three iron cavalry warriors rushed in from the east again, shouting, "Lay down your arms and you won't be killed! Lenient treatment for prisoners!" A Chiang's officer-like soldier tried his best to shout, commanding the troops to resist. He himself also raised his rifle, pulled the trigger, and forced his soldiers to charge forward. We shot the officer in one eye, blinding him, and the rest of the Chiang's troops were stunned. Wang Xinyan then ordered, "Put down your weapons and come out and line up." Zhu Huaibing, the major deputy battalion commander of the engineer battalion of the 55th Division of Chiang's army, and ten Chiang's soldiers obediently laid down a Canadian portable machine gun, a twenty-shot Mauser pistol, twelve Czech rifles, and more than a thousand rounds of ammunition. When this group of Chiang's soldiers realized that there were only three soldiers, they all looked at each other in dismay. Zhu Huaibing, the major deputy battalion commander of Chiang's army, had to say, "I have never encountered such a thing in my life in the army. You Eighth Route Army are really something!"

    【本报冀鲁豫七日电】郓城收复后的第二天，我某部通讯连骑兵通讯副班长和骑兵通讯员王心彦两人赴阎市口一带侦察，走到离阎市口三里地的甄庄南边一片油绿的地里，正在锄地的老乡忽然放下锄，惊恐而又亲切的告诉他两说：“村里面有三十多个中央军！”他们两人听了高兴异常，当时决定副班长回去报告部队，王心彦留在这里监视敌人。躲在高粱地里的王心彦，心里很着急，一会站起来眺望一下，一会又蹲下身去静静思索，通讯员黄有明、张刚宪因公经过这里来，他们三人立即结合起来，开了个“诸葛亮会”，决定用声东击西，“虚张声势”的战法消灭敌人。计划决定后，立即悄悄的到村西头数十米达处的一块高粱地里朝着大街上打了几枪，立即迅速从南边绕到村西头，勇猛的冲进村去。一群蒋军刚集合起来，准备往村西头逃窜，冷不防这意外的一击，顿时队形混乱，乱吵乱跑，叫着：“不行，不行，西边有埋伏！”说着都慌忙折回身来，准备仍回原地固守。但是，这三个铁骑勇士又从东冲进来，大喊着：“交枪不杀！优待俘虏！”一个军官模样的蒋军，尽力嘶叫，指挥着部队抵抗，他自己也提起了步枪板开枪机，对着他的士兵逼他们向前冲，我们一枪把那个军官一只眼睛打瞎了，其余的蒋军也都吓呆了，王心彦便命令道：“放下武器出来站队。”蒋军五十五师师部工兵营少校副营长朱怀炳为首的十名蒋军就这样驯服的放下了一挺加拿大手提机枪，一支二十响驳克枪，十二支捷克步枪，千余发子弹。当这一群蒋军发觉只三个战士时，莫不面面相觑，蒋军少校副营长朱怀炳不得不说：“我从军一生以来还没有遇见这样的事，你们八路军真行！”
