　　Yuli Militia Sweep Salt Soil and Boil Salt
　　[Reported by this newspaper] In the production campaign in Yuli Village, Cixian County, there are eight militiamen in the mutual aid group led by Feng Zilin. Without neglecting farm work, they sweep salt soil and boil saltpeter early every morning. On average, they swept for thirty mornings, selling a total of 360 jin, which at a price of 100 yuan per jin, is equivalent to 36,000 yuan in silver dollars. They also boiled 96.5 jin of saltpeter, which at 500 yuan per jin, is equivalent to 48,750 yuan in silver dollars. They currently have 32 carts of salt soil, enough to boil eight pots, each yielding 25 jin of salt, totaling 200 jin of salt. They can also boil 100 jin of saltpeter, which can be sold for 70,000 yuan in silver dollars, for a total profit of more than 150,000 yuan in silver dollars. After deducting the purchase of furniture and all expenses, each person can divide more than 15,000 yuan. Because they earn so much, the masses have composed a folk song: "Sweeping salt soil in Yuli Street, earns fifteen thousand a month, no shortage of salt to eat at home, no shortage of brine to make tofu. How can you sweep more salt soil? Only through mutual aid for everyone. If you want to boil salt but have no capital, the saltpeter bureau will help you, without hindering your participation in the war effort, without hindering self-study and martial arts training.” Their production is combined with participation in the war effort, martial arts training, and business trips. Regardless of whether they are away or at home, everyone has a share when the accounts are settled. After discussion, they have also established small rules: (1) If someone is transferred to work elsewhere or goes to participate in the war, the accounts will be settled immediately, and 2% will be deducted to reward those who actively sweep soil. (2) If someone in the group does not work hard, everyone will discuss and issue a warning the first time; if they still don't improve, they will be expelled from the group. (3) Accounts will be settled every half month, and dividends will be distributed monthly. The money from sales before settlement will be deposited into the credit cooperative and withdrawn at any time for settlement. (4) We must constantly review and gradually improve our methods. They happily say: We borrowed furniture and bought charcoal on credit, but now we have earned more than 100,000 yuan. Why shouldn't we do this? Under their influence, village chiefs and other cadres have also started a group, earning 60,000 to 70,000 yuan in silver dollars in less than a month, and are now promoting it throughout the village.

　　滏阳里民兵扫盐土熬盐
    【本报讯】磁县滏阳里村生产运动中，有冯自林领导的互助组八个民兵，在不误地的生活下，每天清早扫盐土熬盐熬硝。平均扫了三十早晨，共卖三百六十斤，每斤以一百元熬价合洋三万六千元，熬硝九十六斤半，每斤五百元合洋四万八千七百五十元。现有盐土三十二车能熬八锅，每锅能熬二十五斤，共能熬盐二百斤，还熬硝一百斤，能卖洋七万元，共计赚洋十五万余元。除了购买家具及一切开支外，每人能分一万五千余元。因为他赚钱多，群众编出一歌谣是：“滏阳街扫盐土，一月能赚一万五，不缺家里吃的盐，不缺卤水点豆腐。盐土怎样能扫多，只有大家来互助。你要熬盐没本钱，硝磺局里来帮助，不误前方去参战，不误自学与练武。”他们的生产给参战练武及出差等相结合。不管出外在家到算帐时每人都有股份，经大家讨论，并订出了小规矩：（一）如有调外工作及去参战就即算帐，并抽百分之二奖励扫土积极的。（二）如在组内不好好干，大家讨论第一次记过；一直改不过来开除出组。（三）半月算一次帐，一月一分红。不算帐卖的钱入到信用合作社，随时算帐抽出。（四）要经常检讨逐渐改进办法。他们很高兴的说：借的家具赊的炭，现在赚了十几万，这事为啥咱不干。在他们影响下，有村长等干部又搞起一个组，不到一月赚洋六七万元，现正推动全村。（五分武）
