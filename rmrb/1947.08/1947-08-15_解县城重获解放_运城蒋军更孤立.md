Xinhua News Agency, Jinji-Luyu, 13th: (Delayed) A certain unit of the Jinan Local Corps launched a fierce attack on Jie County town on the evening of the 6th. The defending enemy abandoned the city and fled, and Jie County town was recovered on the morning of the 7th. Jie County town was previously recovered by the People's Liberation Army on April 26th, and was then occupied by the enemy a month later. This recapture makes the Chiang's troops besieged in Yuncheng and Anyi even more isolated.

Xinhua News Agency, Northwest, 13th: The Shaanxi-Gansu-Ningxia Border Government issued a circular on "August 1st" to commend five heroes who were brave and resourceful in fighting the enemy. Among them, Yang Hongzhang and Fan Zhijie were awarded the New Democracy Medal. Yang Hongzhang was the principal of Changwan Elementary School. When Chiang's troops invaded Wayao Fort, he joined the guerrillas and captured a total of 42 enemy soldiers in more than 30 battles. On May 9th, Yang led three militiamen in a surprise attack on Wujia Village near Wayao Fort. Without firing a single shot, they captured 12 Chiang's soldiers at once. The team members, because of Yang's bravery, good fighting skills and effective leadership, have elected him as their instructor. Fan is the district chief of the county. When the enemy invaded, he personally led cadres and militiamen to rush and transport more than 200 piculs of public grain overnight, cover the transfer of the masses, and persisted in fighting in the original place. On May 10th, he joined Yang Hongzhang to lead a small number of militiamen to set up a 20-mile-long suspicious formation, repelling the enemy troops who were looting grain, so that the local people did not suffer any losses. In addition, the county's sharpshooter Li Wanbing captured a total of 37 enemy soldiers in more than ten battles. He was wounded in the charge during the Resiwan battle, and immediately returned to the front line to kill the enemy ten days later. The Border Government specially awarded him the People's Militia Hero Medal. The other two awardees are Zhang Linqing, instructor of Zizhou County, and Wang Zhenxiu.

    【新华社晋冀鲁豫十三日电】（迟到）晋南地方兵团某部，六日晚突向解县城猛攻，守敌弃城溃逃，解县城遂于七日晨收复。按解县城曾于四月二十六日为解放军收复，一月后又被敌窜踞，此次重获解放，使困守运城、安邑两城蒋军益形孤立。
    【新华社西北十三日电】陕甘宁边府于“八一”通令嘉奖对敌斗争勇敢机智的五名英雄，其中杨鸿章、樊志杰两人并荣获新民主主义奖章。杨蒋子于长完小校长，于蒋军进犯瓦窑堡时参加游击队，在三十余次战斗中共俘敌四十二名。五月九日杨率民兵三人，奇袭瓦窑堡附近吴家寨子，未发一弹，一次即生擒蒋军十二名。队员以杨英勇善战，领导有方，已拥其为指导员。樊为该县之区长，当敌来犯时亲率干部民兵于一夜内抢运公粮二百余石，掩护群众转移，坚持原地斗争，并于五月十日联合杨鸿章率少数民兵布成二十余里疑阵，击退抢粮敌军，使当地群众未受任何损失。另该县神枪手李万炳在十余次战斗中共俘敌三十七名，他在热寺湾战斗时冲锋受伤，十日后即刻上火线杀敌，边府特予民兵英雄奖章。另两名受奖者为子洲县公民张林清指导员王振修。
