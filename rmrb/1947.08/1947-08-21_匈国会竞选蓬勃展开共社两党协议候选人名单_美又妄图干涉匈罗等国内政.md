Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 18th. The Hungarian parliamentary election campaign (the formal election will be held on August 31st) is vigorously unfolding throughout the country. On the 15th, the Communist Party and the Social Democratic Party reached a complete agreement on the list of candidates from both parties. The Hungarian Communist Party has candidates in all electoral districts. The Smallholders Party also put forward a list of candidates on the 10th, and the reactionary "Constitutional Protection Group" members within the party were all excluded. The parties participating in the election have held thousands of campaign rallies one after another. Under the instigation of the United States and others, the Hungarian reactionaries have tried their best to undermine the smooth progress of the election campaign, falsely accusing the election of being "undemocratic" and "unfair." However, this has not had any impact on the people. The General Secretary of the Hungarian Communist Party, Rakosi, recently stated at a mass meeting of 50,000 people: the election campaign is "so orderly that even the representatives of the opposition cannot but admit it." Hungarian Prime Minister Dinnyés also pointed out: "The new election is fair, and the people can express their will with complete freedom." The Hungarian government recently allowed more than a hundred foreign journalists to attend and observe the general election, and granted them full freedom of action and the privilege of using transportation.

Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 14th. Various sources report: At a time when the countries of Southeastern Europe are purging treasonous elements and burying themselves in democratic construction, U.S. imperialism is doing its utmost to engage in provocation and retaliation. On the 6th, U.S. Secretary of State Marshall openly slandered Hungary's purge of the Nagi traitorous party members as a "Communist coup"; and announced the cancellation of the $7 million credit loan to Hungary, attempting to put pressure on the upcoming general election. On the same day, the U.S. State Department issued a statement on the Romanian government's detention of the traitor Maniu, and once again sent a note to the country, shamelessly defending Maniu, calling him an "outstanding free man," and attacking the Romanian government's measures as "arbitrary arrests" and "deprivation of people's freedom," and blatantly expressing "serious concern" about Romania's internal affairs. At the same time, the United States seized $50 million worth of gold from Yugoslavia in the United States.

　　匈国会竞选蓬勃展开共社两党协议候选人名单
    美又妄图干涉匈罗等国内政
    【新华社陕北十八日电】匈牙利国会竞选运动（正式选举将于本月三十一日举行），正在全国蓬勃展开。共产党与社会党于十五日对两党侯选人名单已完全协议，匈共在各选区均有候选人。小农党亦于十日提出候选名单，该党内反动之“护宪集团”分子全被排除。参加竞选各党先后已举行竞选大会数千次。匈反动派在美国等策动下，竭力破坏选举运动的顺利进行，诬蔑选举为“不民主”与“不公平”。但在人民中并未引起任何影响，匈共总书记拉科西顷在五万人之群众大会上力称：选举运动“秩序之良好，即反对派代表亦不能不承认。”匈总理丁尼斯也指出：“新选举是公正的，人民能以完全自由表达其意志。”匈政府日前允准百余名外国记者出席参观大选，并予以充分行动自由及利用交通工具之特权。
    【新华社陕北十四日电】各方讯：在东南欧各国清洗叛国分子而埋头于民主建设之时，美帝国主义竟极力从事寻衅与报复。六日，美国务卿马歇尔公然诬蔑匈牙利肃清纳基叛国党徒之举为“共产党政变”；并宣布取消予匈牙利之七百万美元信用贷款，企图压迫即将到来的大选。同日，美国务院对罗马尼亚政府拘捕叛国者马尼乌一事发表声明，并再度照会该国，为马尼乌作无耻辩护，称之为“杰出的自由分子，”反噬罗政府之措施为“武断逮捕”“剥夺人民自由”，并露骨表示对罗国内政“严重关切”。与此同时，美国又查封南斯拉夫在美价值五千万美元之黄金。
