　　Timely Inspection and Praise
　　He Jin Intensifies Seedling Weeding
　　Bai Lin Innovates Using "Li" Tickets to Weed Fields, Leaving No Remnants
　　[Our Newspaper] During the first round of seedling weeding in He Jin Town, mutual aid organizations formed eleven brigades and sixty-six teams, with a total of five hundred and fifteen and a half full and semi-laborers. Only forty-eight people were not organized, with organized labor accounting for over ninety-one percent of the town's total full and semi-labor force. During the campaign, inspections and commendations, using good and bad practical examples to educate everyone, greatly promoted the movement. For example, during the drought, no one in Zhang Chengquan's team in East Street wanted to weed, complaining the seedlings were too small. Other teams weeded 1.2 to 1.3 mu per day. Later, after a sudden heavy rain, work could not be done in the fields for two or three days, and the small seedlings grew to the height of a tiger's mouth. Zhang's team still had eight mu of land un-weeded, and could only weed six to seven fen per day, lagging behind by half a work unit. The seedlings were also in poor condition. Guo Jitang, a model military family member and model woman in East Street, planned ahead and started early. His team of twelve people weeded twenty-three mu of corn in two and a half days, and then weeded eleven mu of millet and beans. After the seedlings were weeded, it rained, and they followed the government's call to plant three and a half mu of hillside land. This example was written on the blackboard and broadcast over the loudspeaker, motivating everyone. A ten-day summary showed a total labor saving of five hundred and five work units, with each person saving two and a half jin of rice per day, totaling one thousand two hundred and sixty-two jin. Each work unit saved eight hundred and fifty yuan in foreign currency, totaling four hundred and twenty-nine thousand two hundred and fifty yuan. (Wu'an People's Daily)
　　[Our Newspaper] In Shangbai Lin, Wu'an County, the entire village has two thousand nine hundred and eighteen mu of land, with two thousand five hundred and sixty-six mu organized. The entire village has one hundred and seventy-eight laborers, with one hundred and thirty-four organized. At the start of the seedling weeding campaign, each team began to develop plans and compete. Each team had a planning director, and the seedlings were weeded faster and better than in previous years. For the sake of competition, Guo Huanyong's team even got up before dawn, and those who woke up would take another nap until dawn, forming a high tide in the seedling weeding campaign. Li Lian's team created an "extra points" system to ensure no sloping land was missed (resolutely leaving no remnants on any piece of land), completing tasks with fewer breaks, and earning more points for doing more work (half a point or one point). This led to the creation of the "five li work ticket," and the entire team weeded an extra nine mu of land, saving nine work units. They also researched a way to eliminate "revived seedlings" (seedlings that were weeded but revived). If the land was severely neglected, weeding "revived seedlings" did not count as work. Each team elected inspection committee members to check the quality of everyone's weeding, regularly pointing out and educating everyone to improve their skills, and a merit recording committee recorded merits and praised skills.

　　及时检查表扬
  　贺进加紧锄苗
  　柏林创用厘票锄地不留尾巴
    【本报讯】贺进镇锄头遍苗中，互助组织起十一个大队，六十六个小组，全半劳力共五百一十五个半，没组织起来只四十八人，组织的占全村全半劳力百分之九十一强。运动中，由于有检查，有表扬，用好坏实际事实教育大家，对运动推动很大。如东街张成全组，天旱时，叫谁锄谁也嫌苗小不锄，别组一天锄一亩二三分，后来天忽然落了大雨，两三天不能下地，小苗长有虎口高，他组还有八亩地没锄出来，每天只能锄六七分，相隔一半工，苗还不好。东街模范军属、模范妇女郭计堂，有计划动手早，他组十二人，二天半锄玉茭二十三亩，后又锄谷子豆子十一亩，苗锄完后，天下了雨，又听政府号召，种坡地三亩半。就拿这个例子黑板上写，喇叭筒广播，推动了大家。十天总结，共省劳力五百零五个，每天每人省米二斤半，共合一千二百六十二斤，每工省洋八百五十元，共计省洋四十二万九千二百五十元。（武安人民报）
    【本报讯】武安上柏林，全村土地二千九百一十八亩，组织起来的土地二千五百六十六亩，全村劳力一百七十八个，组织起一百三十四个，锄苗运动一开始，各组就展开订计划竞赛，每组都有计划主任，苗比往年锄的又快又好。为了竞赛，郭焕永组一天早起还不明，起来的又睡一觉才明，锄苗运动形成高潮。李连组创造“外加点”不丢斜地（一块地坚决不留尾巴），用少休息撵完营生、多做营生多加分（半分或一分），由此创造五厘工票，全组多锄九亩地省工九个。又研究出“坐活苗”（锄掉又翻活了）消灭办法，如果荒的厉害，锄“坐活苗”不算工，各组都选出检查委员，检查谁锄的好坏，经常指出教育大家，提高技术，并有立功委员记功，表扬技术。
