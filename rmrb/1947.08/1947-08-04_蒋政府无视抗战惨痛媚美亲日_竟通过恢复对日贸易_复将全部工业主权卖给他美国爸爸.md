Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 1st: The Chiang Kai-shek Executive Yuan and the Chiang Party Central Political Conference, in order to flatter their American master Wedemeyer, passed resolutions on the 28th and 31st respectively to immediately resume trade with Japan and send a delegation to Japan. According to a United Press report from Nanjing on the 30th, the Chiang family's "National Economic Commission" (under the Chiang family's Executive Yuan), fearing popular opposition, passed the "Temporarily Heeding Public Opinion to Postpone the Opening of Sino-Japanese Trade and Postpone Sending a Delegation to Japan" proposal, which was rejected by the "Executive Yuan" on the 28th of last month. This resolution will be submitted to the "State Council" for approval on August 1st. According to a United Press report, the "Executive Yuan's" approval of the immediate resumption of trade with Japan and the dispatch of a delegation to Japan was made after the "Executive Yuan" members unanimously agreed that "China's (Chiang family's small court) foreign policy cannot run counter to American foreign policy." Furthermore, according to an Associated Press report from Nanjing on the 31st, the Chiang Party's "Central Political Conference" resolved on the 31st to take steps to open trade with Japan, and the delegation to Japan for trade inspection will depart before August 15th. The Chiang family's small court ignores the bitter suffering of the national people's eight-year War of Resistance, sells out national interests, flatters the US and befriends Japan, revealing its ugly features. Another report from Shanghai: Following the China Industry and Commerce Association and the Federation of Domestic Machinery Companies, the Shanghai Machinery Industry Association and the Shanghai branch of the China Industry and Commerce Association also received reporters on the 27th, unanimously and firmly expressing their opposition to the immediate resumption of trade with Japan and the dispatch of a delegation to Japan, so as not to deepen the crisis of Chinese industry and commerce, which is already on the verge of collapse due to the economic aggression of American imperialism.

Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 1st: When Wedemeyer arrived in Shanghai, American businessmen expressed dissatisfaction with the commercial monopoly policy of the four families headed by Chiang Kai-shek, and after slandering the US's past methods of aiding Chiang, Chiang Kai-shek became extremely flustered. American Ambassador Stuart also seized the opportunity to demand that the Chiang government immediately "clarify" its policy on "foreign capital's industry," forcing Chiang Kai-shek to take immediate action to please his American master by selling China's industrial sovereignty on a new large scale. According to an Associated Press report from Nanjing on the 30th, the Chiang government has made a written statement "not to discriminate against American businessmen in China," announcing that it is "extremely willing" (!) for American businessmen to invest in Chinese government (referring to the Chiang government) and private industries, saying that "American businessmen can invest in all sectors of Chinese industry, such as manufacturing, generators, airplanes, machine tools, and steamships." It also declared that it would provide American businessmen in China with convenience in remitting profits back to their home countries in terms of foreign exchange. This approach is equivalent to opening up all of China's industrial construction and resources to Americans, allowing them to control its capital and technology. This is one of the serious treasonous steps taken by Chiang Kai-shek to obtain American aid.

    蒋政府无视抗战惨痛媚美亲日
    竟通过恢复对日贸易
    复将全部工业主权卖给他美国爸爸
    【新华社陕北一日电】蒋家行政院及蒋党中政会议，为献媚美国主子魏德迈，已先后于二十八、三十一两日通过立即恢复对日贸易及派遣代表团赴日的决议案。据合众社南京三十日讯：蒋家“全国经济委员会”（属蒋家行政院）慑于人民反对而通过的“暂从众议请其缓开放中日贸易及缓派代表团赴日案”，已于上月二十八日遭“行政院”否决，此项决议将于八月一日提交“国务会议”批准。据合众社电称：“行政院”之通过立即恢复对日贸易及派遣代表团赴日，系在“行政院”委员一致认为“中国（蒋家小朝廷）外交政策不能与美国外交政策背道而驰”之后。又据美联社南京三十一日电：蒋党“中政会议”三十一日决议采取步骤开放对日贸易，对日贸易考察团将在八月十五日以前出发。蒋家小朝廷无视全国人民八年抗战的惨痛，出卖民族利益，媚美亲日，丑态毕露。另据沪讯：继中国工协及机制国货公司联合会之后，沪机器工业联合会，中国工协沪分会，均于二十七日招待记者，一致坚决表示反对立即恢复对日贸易及派遣代表团赴日，以免加深因受美帝国主义经济侵略业已奄奄一息的中国工商业危机。
    【新华社陕北一日电】当魏德迈到上海时，美国商人对以蒋介石为首的四大家族的商业垄断政策所表示的不满，并诽议美国过去援蒋方法之后，使蒋介石极为慌张。美国大使司徒雷登亦抓紧时机要求蒋政府立即“澄清”对“外国资本的工业”的政策，迫得蒋介石连忙采取行动，以新的大规模的出卖中国工业主权讨好其美国主子。据美联社南京三十日消息：蒋政府已书面申明“不歧视在华美商的政策”，宣布“极愿”（！）美商投资于中国政府（指蒋政府）与私人的工业中，说“美国商人可以投资于中国工业的一切部门中如象制造、发电机、飞机、机械工具与汽船等部门”。并宣称将在外汇方面给在华美商人把利润汇回本国的方便。此项办法等于将全部中国工业建设和资源开放给美国人，任令其资本和技术之控制。这是蒋介石为获得美国援助所采取的严重卖国步骤之一。
