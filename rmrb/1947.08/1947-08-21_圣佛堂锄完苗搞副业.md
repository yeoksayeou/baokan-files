[Report from this newspaper in Southern Hebei on the 19th] The Shengfotang Mutual Aid Group in Wei County, after finishing weeding, is seizing the opportunity to engage in sideline production. Yang Fuzeng in the group is skilled in carpentry, so they decided to make beds. They can make four beds in four days. The cost for each bed is about 2,000 yuan, and after deducting labor and food costs, each bed earns more than 3,000 yuan. Currently, the two groups are dividing the work to rush production.
