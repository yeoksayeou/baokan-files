Diary of Following the Army South
Zhang Bo
First Day
I caught up with the troops in Shifeng Village and followed the队伍 eastward. At this time, a bright crescent moon was surrounded by floating clouds, and the gentle evening breeze was perfect for marching.
    The troops were in high spirits, and the soldiers' faces were filled with excited smiles. The blades had been sharpened for nearly a month and a half, and it was time to let Chiang Kai-shek taste them. Because we were marching in our own base area, we talked and laughed all the way, not feeling lonely at all. Some people were even singing the Three Main Rules of Discipline and Eight Points for Attention. The monotonous harmonica of the second platoon deputy, blowing intermittently, had a very simple tune, always aimed at one hole, blowing in and out. Only when someone's arm accidentally bumped his hand holding the harmonica would his lips move to another hole, and then the tune would change once.
    After walking thirty li, my mouth was terribly dry. Since I had eaten biscuits before setting off, "eating biscuits means you can't do without a well," I wanted water even more, and my throat was a little on fire. The soldiers stopped talking and laughing, and even slowed down their breathing as much as possible, to prevent the moisture in their mouths from evaporating with their breath. The second platoon deputy's harmonica also automatically stopped playing, probably because he also felt unbearably thirsty and kept urging the soldiers to walk faster in a low voice. It was said that we had to walk another ten li to get water. People were so thirsty that their tongues rolled back and forth in their mouths, desperately trying to squeeze out a star of saliva to moisten their dry mouths.
    During a short rest on the road, we were in front of a lonely thatched hut, and I found a young fellow villager.
    "Fellow villager! Support the Eighth Route Army! Hurry home and get a bowl of water to drink!"
    The child, with his dark buttocks exposed, hopped home to get water. He quickly brought out a large bowl of water, and I stopped breathing and drank it all in one gulp. After drinking the water, my nose told me when I breathed that the smell was unpleasant, sour and bitter, but I couldn't care less. Looking back, Cui Baigen from the sixth squad was standing next to me, showing infinite envy. I regretted that I should have left him a little. By the time he asked the young fellow villager for water again, the troops were about to set off.
    During the long rest, everyone's eyes were fixed on the water tank, waiting for the order to drink water, so that the problem could be solved. When drinking water, the order was a bit chaotic. After the water was finished, the second platoon deputy's harmonica started playing again, and everything was awakened and resurrected.
    "Damn it! If it weren't for Chiang Kai-shek, that son of a bitch, would we be as thirsty as turtles? When we launch the great counter-offensive and catch Chiang Kai-shek, what do you think we should do to him!"
    Then the soldiers' opinions came.
    "Gather all the Eighth Route Army and New Fourth Army soldiers and let each person give him a bayonet stab!"
    "What about the Democratic Allied Army? They should also be called to give him a stab."
    Some thought that these methods were too lenient for Chiang Kai-shek. The pain and disaster that Chiang Kai-shek had inflicted on the Chinese people were too much, so much that there was no way to punish him.
    Every soldier was filled with fighting spirit and a firm determination to win, eager to cross the Yellow River in one step. As we marched along the way, the east was already turning white. Because it was the first day of marching, there were still quite a few soldiers who fell behind due to foot pain, but thanks to good mutual assistance, they all caught up by the time we encamped.
Second Day
    After dinner, the troops assembled, and the pleasant bugle call of the army—the second platoon deputy's harmonica—sounded again.
    It was very difficult to walk through about twenty li of sandy ground. Our feet couldn't get a grip, and every step left a deep footprint. Twenty li of sandy ground was more difficult to walk than sixty li of road. Everyone's pace was a bit staggering. It seemed that we were taking one step forward and one step back. The sand here was mixed with sand and dust. Countless powerful feet kicked up the ash sand so high. Fortunately, there was a moon, otherwise it would have been like a dense fog, and you couldn't see the person opposite you.
    The hateful sandy ground was finally broken through, but it was already the time of the rooster's crow at dawn. After passing the sandy ground, the oasis was in sight.
    No matter when or where, as soon as we entered a village and saw the people welcoming the Eighth Route Army by the roadside, the mischievous Lü Honggui always liked to joke with the villagers. Today was no exception.
    "Fellow villager! How far is it from here to my village?"
    "How would I know what village you live in?!"
    Lü Honggui smiled
    "In my village there are people, houses, and trees..."
    The fellow villager also smiled
    "In my village there are also people, houses, and trees... My village is your home! Comrade! Have a drink of water and take a rest."
    Lü Honggui was satisfied with the fellow villager's answer and kept laughing with his mouth open all the way, until it was time to rest and sleep, Honggui was still imitating the fellow villager's speech.
Third Day
    When the bugle call for assembly sounded, my stomach started acting up. I hurriedly went to defecate and couldn't find the assembly point when I came back. Fortunately, the second platoon deputy's harmonica was still playing "yi ya, yi ya," and I found the troops by following the sound of the harmonica. The second platoon deputy's harmonica was obtained during the battle of Tangyin. Although six of the holes could no longer be blown, he still cherished it like a treasure. For more than two months, he had not stopped playing it for a single day. Like the other comrades in the third company, he was always cheerful, happy, and had a firm confidence in the counter-offensive. Whenever you can't hear the sound of the harmonica, it must be because the second platoon deputy feels dry or tired, or because he has argued with someone.
    Summer nights are short, and you can't walk dozens of li before dawn breaks. The place where we are encamped today is where we trained and lived last May. Many soldiers have fellow villagers they know well. As soon as we entered the village, the villagers came out to welcome us, and the children crowded around us. This place had been ravaged by the Chiang bandits for five months. Once they saw our strong troops, they felt as close as if they had seen relatives. Each soldier was surrounded by three or four children, holding several small hands in one hand. The children stroked the grenades on the soldiers' waists and felt very novel. Basins and pots were filled with boiling water and sent over. The old women were all recounting the cruel looting of the Chiang troops, running with their small feet, hobbling as they imitated the Chiang troops chasing and catching chickens. There was not a single chicken left in the entire village. The adults were all telling stories of the Chiang landlord's cruel reckoning, and the young people were recounting their heroic stories of fighting the Chiang troops and the "earth ash" (referring to local bandits such as the Home Return Corps).
    Even after we had fallen asleep, we could still vaguely hear the villagers' voices in discussion. (To be continued)

    随军南下日记
    张勃
    第一日
    在时风村赶上了部队，跟着队伍一直向正东前进。此时一钩皎月，浮云环绕，晚风微气拂，正宜行军。
    部队的情绪极为愉快，战士们的脸上都流露着兴奋的笑容，磨了将近一个半月的锋刃，也该请蒋介石尝尝了，因为是在自己根据地行军，所以一路说说笑笑；颇不寂寞；有人还在唱三大纪律八项注意军歌；二排副单调的口琴声，时吹时辍，音调是非常简单的，总是对准一个孔，一呼一吸的吹着，不知道是谁的胳膀偶而碰了他那只拿口琴的手，才把他的嘴唇移到了另外一个孔去，于是音调才改换了一次。
    走了三十里，嘴里实在干得要命，又赶上出发前吃的是饼，“吃了饼，离不开井”越发想水喝，嗓子里有点冒火；战士们都停止了谈笑，连呼吸都尽量缓慢一点，免得嘴里的水份顺着呼吸蒸发了；二排副的口琴也自动停止了伴奏，大约他也感到渴不可耐，不住的小声督促战士们快走。据说还要走十里路，才有水喝，人们渴得舌头反来复去的在嘴里打滚，拼命想挤出一星口水来，好润湿一下干得快要裂了的口腔。
    路上小休息，我们在一间孤独的茅草屋前，我找到了一位小老乡。
    “老乡！拥护拥护八路军吧！快回家找碗水来喝！”
    小孩光着黝黑的屁股，一蹦一跳的回家找水去了。很快的端出来一大碗水，我停止了呼吸，一口气喝了下去，喝完了水，喘气的时候，鼻子才告诉我，气味难闻，又酸又苦，但是也顾不了那许多。回头一看六班崔柏根站在我旁边，流露着无限的羡慕之情，我后悔应该给他留下一点；等他再开口问那位小老乡要水的时候，部队又要出发了。
    大休息，要喝水了，大家的眼睛都眼巴巴的看着水缸，只等喝水的命令一下，就好解决问题。喝水时，秩序有几分紊乱。水喝完了，二排副的口琴又吹起来了，一切都苏醒了，复活了。
    “奶奶的球！你说要不是蒋介石这个狗日的，咱们能渴的象龟孙？将来大反攻，捉住蒋介石，你说应该怎么搞他！”
    于是战士们的意见都来了。
    “把所有的八路军、新四军都集合起来，每人挑一刺刀！”
    “还有民主联军呢？也应该叫他们挑一刀。”
    有的以为这些办法都便宜了蒋介石，蒋介石所给予中国人民的痛苦灾难太多了，真多到没法处制他。……
    每一个战士都怀着饱满的战斗情绪，一颗坚定必胜的心，恨不得一步就跨过黄河去，一路行来，不觉东方已发白，因为第一天行军个别脚痛掉队的战士还是不少，但由于互助得好，到宿营时也都跟上来了。
    第二日
    晚饭后，部队集合了，军中愉快的号角——二排副的口琴又响起来了。
    穿过约莫二十里的沙地，非常吃力，脚使不上劲，一步一步的都留下很深的足迹；二十里沙地，比六十里路还难走，大家的步伐都有些蹒跚，跄踉。似乎在走一步，退一步，这里的沙地是沙和尘土混合在一起的。千万只有力的脚把灰沙扬起多高，幸而有月亮，否则真和下浓雾差不多，对面不见人了。……
    可憎的沙地终于被突破了，但已是鸡鸣破晓的时光了。沙地过完，绿洲在望。
    无论何时何地，只要一进村子，看见路旁有欢迎八路军的老百姓，调皮的吕红贵总是喜欢和老乡开玩笑，今天自然不能例外。
    “老乡！这儿离俺村还有多远？”
    “俺知道你家在啥村啊？！”
    吕红贵笑了
    “俺村里有人、有房、有树……。”
    老乡也笑了
    “俺村里也有人、有房、有树……俺村就是你家！同志！喝口水，歇歇吧。”
    吕红贵对于老乡的回答，感到了满意，一路上都在张着大嘴笑，直到休息睡觉的时候，红贵还在学老乡说话。
    第三日
    吹号集合的时候，我的肚子作起怪来了，匆匆忙忙的去大便，回来找不到集合地点了，幸亏二排副的口琴还在伊呀伊呀的响，顺着琴音才找到了部队。二排副的口琴，是在打汤阴时候得来的，虽然已经有六个孔吹不响了，但他依然爱如珍宝，两个多月以来他没有一天停止演奏过，他和三连的其他同志一样，永远是愉快的，欢天喜地的，对于反攻，具有坚定的信心，什么时候，你听不见口琴的声音了，那一定是二排副感到了口干，或者是疲乏了，要不然就是和谁吵了几句嘴。
    夏天夜短，走不了几十里路，天就亮了，今天宿营的地方，去年五月我们在那里整训住过，很多战士都有自己熟识的老乡，一进村子，老乡们都出来欢迎了，孩子们都拥上来，这里曾受蒋贼蹂躏过五个月，一旦看见了自己这样强大的队伍，好象见了亲人一样倍感亲切，每个战士都被三四个孩子包围着，一只手牵着好几只小手，孩子们抚摩着战士们腰间的手榴弹，感到十分新奇，盆呀罐呀，都盛满了开水送来了。老太婆们都在述说蒋军残酷的抢掠，两只小脚，一巅一跛的跑着学蒋军赶鸡捉鸡的样子，全村已经没有一只鸡子，壮年人都在诉说小老蒋地主倒算的凶暴，青年人都在追述他们打蒋军和土灰（如还乡团之类的土匪）英勇的故事。
    直到我们已经入梦乡了，耳边还隐约可以听见老乡们议论的声音。（未完）
