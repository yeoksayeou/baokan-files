Xinhua News Agency, Jinji Luyu, 18th: The Taihang guerrilla warfare behind enemy lines has compressed the enemy in areas such as the south of the Yubei Road, both sides of Pinghan, and Yu (Ci) Tai (Gu) Qi (County) Ping (Ding) in central Jin, turning the vast area behind enemy lines into the domain of the peasant masses. In the past six months, the militia and working teams behind enemy lines in the area have fought 3,226 battles, killing, wounding, and capturing 4,599 enemies, disintegrating 682 enemy and puppet troops, and liberating 286 villages with a population of 200,211. In the struggle, many heroes who killed the enemy and model working teams emerged, such as the Hui County Guo and working team, which insisted on democratic power, organized intelligence and wiped out enemies, and carried out political offensives; the Anyang Ren Wenliang working team, which suppressed traitors and bullies, combined political offensives, and launched counter-liquidation; and the Xiwu Lian Zhizhong and Pingding Zhou Jiating working teams, which were brave and good at fighting and repeatedly defeated the enemy and puppets. These working teams are well-known throughout the area. The masses' heroes who killed the enemy include: the reconnaissance heroine Han Erhua, who was brave and resourceful and entered and exited enemy strongholds three times; the capture hero "Flying Tiger on the Roof" Hu Degui, who captured 78 "Homecoming Corps" landlords in four months; the explosion hero Mu Shancheng, who organized the masses of the whole village to explode, detonating 82 stone mines and landmines at one time, killing and wounding 88 enemies. There are many innovations in carrying out guerrilla warfare behind enemy lines in various places. The basic experiences are: (1) Carrying out guerrilla warfare behind enemy lines is inseparable from the overthrow movement of the masses behind enemy lines against traitors and bullies and the distribution of land. Cadres, militia, and working teams must be armed overthrow teams that both fight and mobilize the masses. Experience has proved that without the revenge and overthrow movement behind enemy lines, guerrilla warfare will lose its meaning and foundation. Without the widespread and effective development of guerrilla warfare, the execution of the overthrow and revenge movement is also impossible. (2) Military battles are closely combined with political battles. The Taigu militia working team proposed: "Fight when there is an enemy, and propagandize when there is no enemy." For die-hard landlords and traitors and bullies, we must be tenacious and fight hard. For landlords who waver and withdraw from the fruits of the struggle, we should strive for them separately. (3) On the one hand, we should prevent the mass armed forces formed behind enemy lines from being usurped by landlords and special agents. On the other hand, we should boldly let go and cultivate their combat capabilities. Blind suspicion or the phenomenon of transferring them far away to make them guerrilla forces will weaken their strength. (4) Boldly develop combat arts such as cold guns, explosions, capture, night touch, and joint defense operations, such as "aiming at and defeating one point, breaking through an area," using small armed forces to carry out the "starry sky" tactics of spreading out on the surface or long-distance surprise capture. (5) It is necessary to organize the wartime life and order of the masses, such as emptying the houses, temporary transfer, intelligence sentry posts, night patrols and joint defense, etc., to persist in long-term struggle.

　　武装保护翻身充分发动群众
  　太行敌后游击战大发展
    半年歼敌五千解放群众二十余万
    【新华社晋冀鲁豫十八日电】太行敌后游击战争，把豫北道的路南、平汉两侧及晋中榆（次）太（谷）祁（县）平（定）等地的敌人压缩在点线内，使敌后广大地区，变成农民群众的天下，该区敌后民兵武工队半年来共作战三千二百二十六次，毙伤俘敌四千五百九十九名，瓦解敌伪军六百八十二名，解放村庄二百八十六个，人口二十万零二百十一人。在斗争中，出现了不少杀敌英雄与模范武工队，如坚持民主政权、组织情报全奸、开展政攻的辉县郭与武工队；镇压奸霸结合政攻开展反倒算的安阳任文亮武工队；英勇善战，屡败敌伪修武连致中、平定周家庭等武工队。这些武工队都已名闻全区，群众杀敌英雄则如：侦察女英雄韩二花，曾勇敢机智，三次进出敌据点。捕捉英雄“房上飞虎”胡德贵，四个月捉“还乡团”地主七十八名。爆炸英雄穆善成，组织全村群众爆炸，一次爆炸石雷、地雷八十二颗，炸死伤敌八十八名。各地在开展敌后游击战争上都有许多创造，基本经验是：（一）开展敌后游击战争与敌后群众反奸霸分田地的翻身运动不可分，干部民兵武工队必须是既打仗又发动群众的武装翻身队。经验证明：没有敌后的复仇翻身运动，游击战争便失去意义与生根基础，没有游击战争的广泛有力开展，翻身复仇运动的执行亦不可能。（二）打军事仗与打政治仗紧密结合，太谷民兵武工队提出：“有敌就打仗，没敌就宣传。”对死心踏地的地主奸霸要顽强要打得痛，对动摇退出果实的地主，则分别争取。（三）对敌后组成的群众武装一面应防止被地主特务纂夺，一面应大胆放手培养其斗争能力，盲目怀疑、或远调使其游击队化的现象，都会削弱力量。（四）大胆发挥冷枪、爆炸、捕捉、夜摸、联防作战等战斗艺术，如“瞅准打垮一点，突开一片”，用小型武装，进行面的撒开的“满天星”战术或远距离的奇袭捕捉等。（五）要组织群众的战时生活与秩序，如空室清野，临时转移，情报岗哨、夜巡联防等，以坚持长期斗争。
