Xinhua News Agency, Frontline of Hebei-Shandong-Henan, 2nd. The field army under Generals Liu Bocheng and Deng Xiaoping annihilated nine and a half brigades, over 60,000 men, of Chiang Kai-shek's regular army in twenty-one days. A spokesman for the headquarters pointed out to reporters that this has two important significances: First, it liberated millions of people, recovered vast areas south of the Yellow River, and provided armed protection for the repair of the riverbanks. Second, it shattered Chiang Kai-shek's Yellow River strategy, opened up the vast battlefield of southwestern Shandong, and prepared better graves for Chiang Kai-shek's invading army. The spokesman said: Chiang Kai-shek's delusion of creating a Yellow River flood and relying on the Yellow River to save his life is simply ridiculous. Since our army crossed the natural barrier of the Yellow River, Chiang Kai-shek's clumsy and panicked appearance has been truly laughable. The spokesman summarized the situation of these twenty-one days, saying: Our army first annihilated the 55th Division of Liu Ruming's group in Yuncheng on July 7th. Chiang Kai-shek hurriedly transferred the remnants of Wang Zhonglian's group from northern Henan to reinforce them, and specially brought Wang Jingjiu from Shandong to command. Unexpectedly, as soon as Wang Jingjiu made a move, the 153rd Brigade of the 63rd Division was annihilated. He then sent three divisions into our pockets. With the speed of divine soldiers descending from the sky, we trapped them, and they didn't even know where we came from. The 32nd Division and the 70th Division were then completely annihilated by us, and the 66th Division was surrounded and unable to move, becoming the bait on our fishing hook. Chiang Kai-shek was terrified and quickly flew to Kaifeng to personally deploy, resulting in the 199th Brigade of the 66th Division being sent to take the bait. Now Chiang Kai-shek is piecing together a force from all directions, transferring the 82nd Brigade of the 52nd Division from Hankou, the Reorganized 10th Division, Reorganized 79th Division, and 1st Cavalry Brigade from the Tongguan and Xi'an areas, the 40th Division from northern Henan, and the 206th Division from Zhengzhou and Luoyang, and calling the notorious defeated general Wang Zhonglian to command this mixed bag. What use is it? At most, it can only fill the vacancies of the nine and a half annihilated brigades. Let everyone see! That Mr. Wang is already finished, and this Mr. Wang is here to deliver gifts again. The spokesman continued: It is worth noting Chiang Kai-shek's rumors during this period, one accusing the People's Liberation Army of destroying the riverbanks, and the other boasting about the so-called unprecedented victory of the National Army at Yangshanji and the utter defeat of Liu Bocheng's troops. For twenty years, the Chinese people have learned a lesson: all of Chiang Kai-shek's propaganda must be viewed from the opposite perspective. The truth about the so-called victory of the National Army is like this, and what about the People's Liberation Army destroying the riverbanks? It is precisely Chiang Kai-shek's own conspiracy to breach the dikes and release water as a smokescreen. Liu Ruming is carrying out his orders to destroy the riverbanks, and the People's Liberation Army has the full responsibility, determination, and ability to severely punish these murderers. Finally, the spokesman said: Our achievements in these twenty-one days are roughly equivalent to the total of the five months in the second half of last year. The fact that our army is growing stronger in battle and the enemy is growing weaker is already obvious and requires no further explanation. It is noteworthy that the decline in the morale of Chiang's army, both officers and soldiers, is now more obvious, making them easier to annihilate. Not only are lower-ranking officers and soldiers surrendering in increasing numbers, but even senior generals such as the commander and deputy commander of the 70th Division, the deputy commander of the 55th Division, and even Song Ruike, the commander of the 66th Division and Chen Cheng's confidant, voluntarily stated their true positions without waiting for our army to inquire. These people had just received training in Nanjing, which shows that Chiang Kai-shek's clamor and wailing are becoming increasingly ineffective.

    廿一天作战等于去年下半年总和
    证明我军愈战愈强
    蒋贼黄河战略已被粉碎
    【新华社冀鲁豫前线二日电】刘伯承、邓小平两将军所部野战军，在二十一天内消灭蒋家正规军九个半旅六万余人，司令部发言人顷向记者指出其重要意义有二：第一是解放了数百万人民，收复了黄河南岸广大地区，武装掩护了修复河堤。第二是粉碎了蒋介石的黄河战略，开辟了鲁西南广大战场，给蒋介石进犯军准备了更好的坟墓。发言人说：蒋介石妄想制造黄河水灾，倚赖黄河救命，未免太荒唐了。自从我军南渡黄河天险以来，蒋介石那种黔驴计穷手忙脚乱的蠢像，实在令人好笑。发言人概述这二十一天的情形说：我军首先于七七在郓城消灭刘汝明集团的五十五师，蒋介石连忙赶调豫北王仲廉集团的残兵败卒增援，并且特别从山东把王敬久调来指挥，不料王敬久刚一出手，跟着六十三师之一五三旅就被消灭，他又把三个师送到我们的口袋里，我们以神兵天降之势，把他们套住了，他们还不知道我们从那儿来的。其中卅二师和七十师随即被我干脆消灭，六十六师被围不能动，做了我们钩鱼的钩饵。蒋介石惊慌万状，赶快飞到开封亲自动手部署，结果是把六十六师的一九九旅送来上钩，现在蒋介石又东拉西凑，从汉口调来五二师之八二旅，从潼关、西安一带调来整十师，整七十九师，骑一旅，从豫北调来四十师，从郑州、洛阳调来二○六师，并且叫有名的败将王仲廉来指挥这个杂货摊子，试问有什么用呢？至多只能补足被消灭的九个半旅的缺额。大家看吧！那个姓王的已经完蛋，这个姓王的又来送礼了。发言人继称：值得注意是这个时期蒋介石的谣言，一则诬蔑解放军破坏河堤，再则吹嘘所谓国军在羊山集的空前大捷和刘伯承部的溃不成军。二十年来中国人民已经学会了一条经验，蒋介石的一切宣传都要从反面看，所谓国军大捷的真象是如此，所谓解放军破坏河堤呢？也正是蒋介石自己阴谋决堤放水的烟幕。刘汝明正在执行他的命令破坏河堤，解放军有充分的责任决心和能力，一定要严厉惩办这些杀人凶手。最后发言人称：我们这廿一天的战果，大略相当于去年下半年五个月内的总和。我军之愈战愈强，敌人之愈战愈弱，实已昭然若揭，不须再加任何说明。可以注意的是蒋军上下士气之消沉，现已更为明显，因此更容易被消灭。不仅下级军官和士兵自动缴械者日益普遍，甚至七十师的正副师长，五十五师的副师长，乃至陈诚亲信六六师师长宋瑞珂等高级将领，都不待我军查问，就自动说出他们的真实职份，这几个人都是刚刚从南京受了训来的，可见蒋介石的叫嚣和哀鸣，也已经日益没有效力了。
