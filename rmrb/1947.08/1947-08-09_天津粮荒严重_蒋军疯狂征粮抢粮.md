    Xinhua News Agency, Jin-Cha-Ji, August 6th: According to the Tianjin Yishibao, the food shortage in Tianjin is severe. The city has a population of 1,681,000, and at a minimum, requires nearly 1,000 tons of various grains (including flour, rice, and coarse grains) daily. However, the total daily output of all flour mills in Tianjin is less than one-tenth of the city's daily minimum needs. The "large-scale grain imports from the Northeast" that Kuomintang newspapers have recently been vigorously promoting actually amount to only 2,510,000 jin of wheat flour (equivalent to just over 1,000 tons), which can only sustain the city's military and civilians for one day. Under these circumstances, the Chiang government is still frantically collecting war grain, pushing the people to their deaths. Farmers in the relatively grain-rich areas near Tianjin and along the Beining Railway in the Chiang-occupied areas, such as Yangcun, Langfang, and Changli, have recently learned that Chiang's side plans to requisition all actual grain, and are burying their grain in an attempt to save themselves.
    Xinhua News Agency, Ji-Cha-Re-Liao, August 6th: Chiang Kai-shek recently ordered the looting of the fruits of labor of our liberated peasants in the Northeast. According to the Tianjin Dagongbao on June 30th, Chiang's bandit gang personally drafted a plan for looting, stating: "Unrecovered areas should be assigned troops to protect the masses (referring to fleeing landlords) to harvest soybeans and wheat and transport them to strongholds." The newspaper also stated: This plan has been transferred from Chiang's Northeast Headquarters to the Chief Executive's Office. Currently, the military and civilians in our liberated areas are stepping up their defenses and preparing to deal a head-on blow to the grain-robbing bandits.

    天津粮荒严重
    蒋军疯狂征粮抢粮
    【新华社晋察冀六日电】据天津益世报透露，天津粮荒严重，全市人口为一百六十八万一千人，最低限度，每日需各种粮食（包括面粉大米杂粮等）近一千吨。然津市各面粉厂每日产量总数，尚不足全市每日最低需用的十分之一。国民党各报近日所大肆宣传的“东北食粮大量入关”其实际情况，据悉运来之麦粉总数，不过二百五十一万余斤（折合一千余吨）仅能维持全市军民一日的生活。在此情形下蒋政府仍疯狂征收内战军粮，逼民于死。津市附近及北宁沿线蒋占区产粮较丰之区，如杨村、廊房、昌黎等地农民，最近得悉蒋方有全部征实之说，均纷纷埋藏粮食以作自救。
    【新华社冀察热辽六日电】蒋介石近命令抢劫我东北翻身农民劳动果实，据天津大公报六月三十日披露蒋贼手订抢劫办法内称：“未收复区配以军队掩护群众（按指逃亡地主）收割豆麦运往据点。”该报并称：此办法已由蒋东北行营转长官部。现我解放区各地军民正严加防备，准备予抢粮匪贼以迎头痛击。
