　　The People of Baiguan Voluntarily Work According to the Amount of Labor
  　Consolidating Mutual Aid and Accelerating Weeding
    [Report from this newspaper] During the weeding in Baiguan Village, Ninth District of Wu'an, mutual aid was rectified, completely voluntary integration was implemented, work was assigned according to the amount of labor, and feudal sabotage elements were squeezed out, which consolidated mutual aid and ensured the smooth progress of weeding. Baiguan used to be a model production village, with a well-established set of methods in form and a large scope of organization, but in reality, it was enthusiastic for a while and then cooled down after being relaxed. This spring, mutual aid completely collapsed, and even sixteen of the twenty-one small workshops organized last winter collapsed. At the beginning of weeding, everyone felt that at this rate, some land would be barren. Therefore, a general meeting was held. First, the cadres conducted self-criticism. For example, labor hero Wei Riwu criticized his administrative orders in his work style, the chairman of the farmers' association criticized his lack of in-depth leadership and understanding of the people's emotions and difficulties, and some cadres criticized their preoccupation with challenging competitions without solving practical problems. Various groups' self-criticism also revealed many problems. For example, the seventh group of five households had more than twenty workdays for which wages were not paid last year (work tickets were messed up and no accounts were kept); the third group failed to properly evaluate wages for the elderly and children last year, and did not record points according to the amount of work, so many people suffered losses; several solitary and widowed households in the fourth group were "sharp heads" who often took advantage of the group. Wang Tingxiang said: "My family has no labor force, so the mutual aid group should cultivate my land." Wei Si did work for him in the spring, but has not paid wages to this day; Xie Laohu, nicknamed "Tiger," in the fifth group, is a local tyrant. When the group members discussed issues, he cursed: "Now everyone can talk." Group leader Liu Yuankui said: "If he doesn't leave, I'll always be sick." Landlord Fan Yinshi also caused trouble in the group, wanting to divide the harvest in the same way as those who worked hard, which made everyone unhappy; Fan Qingshun's mule often scavenged outside, neglecting the land allocated to the group. After two days of discussion, everyone unanimously said: "It's all because we used to form groups according to area, without complete voluntariness." Therefore, the whole village re-implemented voluntary group formation. First, twenty-two landlord sabotage elements were squeezed out of the twenty-four, leaving only two relatively honest and hardworking landlords temporarily, to see how they would perform in the future; fifteen "sharp heads" such as Ma Tang and Jia Deyi were initially rejected by everyone, but later nine of them made thorough self-criticisms before being individually absorbed, while six were isolated. Except for these twenty-eight households, the rest of the village voluntarily joined twenty-seven groups, consisting of two hundred and fifty-four full laborers, one hundred and thirteen half laborers, and one hundred and ninety-eight livestock, all organized. Ten work point team leaders and two work evaluation committee members were selected, stipulating a self-criticism every three days and an account settlement every seven days. Each group formulated its own short-term plan to launch a concentrated weeding campaign. Solitary and widowed households with no labor force decided to no longer be forcibly assigned to groups, but to implement voluntary care, automatically coming to the groups to buy workdays, or spinning and weaving to exchange for workdays. Liu Renyi, Yuan Shuangquan, and other relatively honest households with no labor force, came to request work arrangements, saying that they would do their best if the group planned to use them, which everyone felt was a good and fair arrangement. Wei Youde and other four households, all with children, could not leave the adults, so they voluntarily formed a group, which everyone felt was appropriate. The group leaders of each group were democratically elected by the masses, and everyone said: "This is real democracy." After voluntary integration, they discussed and implemented serious work recording, work point conversion, and work ticket methods. The whole village was in high spirits for weeding, weeding three thousand six hundred mu in six days, of which two thousand mu had been weeded twice. Everyone said: "It will never collapse again."

    [Report from this newspaper, Taiyue, 14th] Xialiqiu Village, Yangcheng, rectified mutual aid with poor peasants as the backbone. When the village organized mutual aid this spring, the leaders only sought large numbers without considering the actual situation, and organized twenty-one mutual aid groups in one night. Even the six members of the Wu Jun family, father and son, uncles and nephews, formed a group. When it rained on the 27th and 28th of last month, the cadres accepted the experience of other places in following the poor peasant line to lead mutual aid groups, and immediately convened a meeting of more than twenty poor and hired peasants, tracing the three reasons for the lack of enthusiasm in the mutual aid groups: First, they were formed by administrative orders; second, the sabotage of the targets of struggle. Landlord Wu Zhengang said: "They meddle too much. Who didn't know how to complain in the past when there was no mutual aid!" Some landlords even became group leaders, perfunctorily complying with the cadres. When pressed hard, they would come and work for a few days, but when not pressed, they would do their own things. Finally, there was no commendation of the advanced to motivate the backward. Therefore, it was decided that each group, in addition to the group leader, would also set up a "weed out traitors" leader, specializing in managing the targets of struggle. Members of the farmers' association would freely combine and incorporate the targets of struggle into each group. The group leader and the "weed out traitors" leader would be held by poor and hired peasants and strong members. In addition, after several mass meetings, twenty-two male groups were voluntarily organized, with one hundred and fifty-five full and half laborers, and ten female groups, with one hundred and thirteen full and half laborers. Since the afternoon of the 30th, except for cooking lunch and taking care of children, more than two hundred people have gone to the fields. In addition to replanting, they have also begun a concentrated weeding campaign. Corn has been weeded three times, and the millet fields are now beginning to be weeded three times, and the cotton four times.

　　百官自愿按活计工
  　巩固互助加速锄苗
    【本报讯】武安九区百官村锄苗中整顿互助，彻底自愿结合，按活计工，挤出封建破坏分子，使互助获得巩固，锄苗顺利进行。百官过去是生产模范村，形式上很有一套办法，组织的范围也大，但实际是抓紧就热一阵，放松就冷了。今春互助完全垮台，连去冬组织的二十一座小型作坊也垮了十六座。锄苗开始，大家觉得这样下去有些地就要荒，于是开大会首先干部自我检讨，如劳动英雄魏日武检讨了自己作风上的行政命令，农会主席检讨了自己领导不深入，不了解群众情绪与困难，有的干部检讨光顾挑战竞赛，不解决实际问题等。各组检讨也发现不少问题，如第七组五户，去年有二十多个工没使上工资（工票弄乱了，又没留帐）；第三组去年老人小孩工资没评好，没按活记分，许多人吃了亏；第四组有几个孤寡户是尖头，常在组里沾光，王廷相说：“我家没劳力，互助组就应该给我种地。”魏四的春天给他做了活，到现在不给工资；第五组有一个外号谢老虎的，是一个恶霸，组员研究问题，他骂：“现在人不人，马不马，都能说话了。”组长刘元魁说：“不去了他，我到啥时也是块病。”地主范寅时在组里也是光捣蛋，好受家跟他订的一样分，全组谁也没情绪；范清顺喂的骡子常在外边拾砍，把地丢到组里不管。讨论了两天，大家异口同声说：“都怨以前按片编组，没有彻底自愿。”于是全村重新实行自愿结组。首先把二十四户地主破坏分子挤出去二十二户，只暂留两户较老实肯劳动的地主，看他们以后表现；麻糖、贾德义等十五户尖头，开始大家都不要，以后有九户作了彻底检讨，才个别吸收了他们，有六户被孤立出去。全村除了这廿八户，其余都自愿结合到二十七个组里，二五四个全劳力，一一三个半劳力，一九八头牲口，全部组织起来，选了十个拨工队长，两个评功委员，规定三天一检讨，七天一算帐，各组自订短期计划，突击锄苗。孤寡无劳力户，决定不再往组里硬安硬派，实行自愿照顾，自动到组来买工，或纺织做活换工。较老实的没劳力户刘仁义、苑双全等，这时都来请求给他们安排活，叫组里打算上他，他一定尽力干，大家觉得这才算俺有情他有义。魏有的等四户，都有儿童，都不能离开大人，便自愿结成一组，大家都感觉合适。各组组长都由群众完全民主推选出来，大家说：“这才算民主。”自愿结合后，又讨论实行认真的记工折工与工票办法，全村锄苗情绪很高，六天就锄了三千六百亩，其中有二千亩已锄完二遍，大家都说：“再也垮不了啦。”（而东）
    【本报太岳十四日电】阳城下李邱村，以雇贫农为骨干，整顿互助。该村在今春组织互助时，领导上只求数目字大，不讲实际，一晚上就组织了二十一个互助组。斗争对象吴钧父子叔侄，六个人也成立了一个组。上月二十七、八下雨时，干部接受了其他地方走雇贫路线，领导互助组的经验，当即召开了二十余人的贫雇农会议，追出互助组没劲的原因有三：首先因为是行政命令编成，其次斗争对象的破坏。地主吴振纲说：“管得倒宽，往年没有互助，谁不知道圪嚷！”还有些地主，竟当了组长，他们敷衍干部，追的紧啦，来一块圪攻几天，抓不紧，还是各做各的。最后，没有表扬先进，以推动落后。因此今后决定：每组除组长外，又设一锄奸组长，专门管理斗争对象，农会会员自由结合，把斗争对象编入各组，组长及除奸组长由贫雇农及坚强会员担任。此外，又经过几次的群众会，又自愿组织起男组二十二个，全半劳力一五五个，女组十个，全半劳力一一三个。自三十日下午起，除做午饭看娃以外，二百余人都上了地。回茬补种外又开始突击锄苗，玉茭已锄过三遍，谷地现在开始锄三遍，棉花四遍。
