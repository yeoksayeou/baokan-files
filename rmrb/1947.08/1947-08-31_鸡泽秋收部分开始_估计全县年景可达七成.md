　　Chickenfoot Township Autumn Harvest Begins
  　Estimated County-Wide Harvest Reaching 70%
    [Report from our correspondent group on the 29th] The autumn harvest has partially begun in Chickenfoot Township. Sorghum is being harvested, and millet will be ready in about half a month. This year, under the slogan of "Organize to Get Rich," the county has organized more than 2,700 mutual aid teams, with 60% of the labor force participating. After a tenacious struggle against drought and insect pests, and smashing various sabotage attempts by landlords and special agents, the county has achieved a harvest of 70%. According to leading figures, the 300,000 mu of autumn crops in the county can yield at least 26.4 million jin of refined grains. Adding the 9.18 million jin from the wheat harvest and 6.41 million jin of rice from various side occupations in half a year, the total income will be 41.99 million jin. Based on a population of 90,000 in the county, this averages 468 jin of refined grain per person. Even without counting the income from side occupations in the second half of the year, it can still achieve "three parts farming, one part surplus." To complete the task of increasing agricultural production, the county has extensively dug rivers and repaired canals, carrying out water conservancy projects, mobilizing a total of 100,050 laborers. The Xinglonggou, Wenminggou, Guanzhuanggou, and Liuzhuanggou were extended, transforming 16,033 mu of dry land into irrigated land, overcoming this year's drought, and ensuring timely planting. The autumn crops on irrigated land are better than in any previous year. According to farmers, each mu of irrigated land will yield at least two more dou (30 jin dou) of grain. In areas far from the river, wells were organized to be dug. Preliminary statistics show that more than 400 earthen wells and 110 brick wells have been dug, which can irrigate at least 5,000 mu of land. The county also pays special attention to organizing side occupations. Currently, 20,000 organized women in the county have woven 70,000 bolts of cloth in half a year, each bolt weighing three jin and ten and a half liang, earning 4.26 million jin of rice, equivalent to half of this year's wheat harvest. In the first half of the year, 1.5 million jin of salt was extracted and 60,700 jin of saltpeter was refined. Combined with the income from noodle shops, flour mills, and other sources, a total of 2.143 million jin of rice was earned. Side-occupation production has strongly supported agricultural production. The 1,150 heads of cattle added in half a year were mostly bought with income from side occupations. The realization of "three parts farming, one part surplus" has further encouraged the production enthusiasm of the liberated peasants, and it is planned that the income from side occupations in the second half of the year will definitely exceed that of the first half. Now, the peasants are joyfully harvesting the fruits of a year's hard work. (Lin Li)

　　鸡泽秋收部分开始
  　估计全县年景可达七成
    【本报记者团二十九日电】鸡泽全县秋收已部分开始，高粱正在收割，谷子再有半月亦可登场。该县今年在“组织起来发家致富”的号召下，组织了二千七百多个互助组，参加的劳动力占百分之六十。经过同旱灾、虫灾的顽强斗争，又粉碎了地主特务的种种破坏，取得全县范围收获可达七成的成绩。据领导方面估计，全县卅万亩秋苗，至少可收二千六百四十万斤细粮，加上麦季收入的九百一十八万斤，及半年各种副业米六百四十一万斤，总共可收入四千一百九十九万斤，按全县九万人计算，平均每人合细粮四百六十八斤，下半年副业收入不计在内，亦可达到耕三余一。为完成农业增产任务，该县曾大量挖河修渠，兴修水利，总计动员了十万零五千个劳动力，把兴隆沟、文明沟、贯庄沟、刘庄沟等加长了，一万六千三十三万亩旱地变成水地，克服了今年的旱灾，保证了按时下种，水地秋苗，胜过以往任何一年，据农民谈，每亩水地至少要多收两大斗（三十斤斗）粮食。在离河远的地区，则组织打井，据初步统计，打土井四百多眼，打砖井一百一十眼，最低能浇五千亩地。该县亦特别注意组织副业，现全县有组织的妇女，已达两万，半年织布七万匹，每匹三斤十两半，可赚米四百二十六万斤，等于今年麦季收入的二分之一。上半年淋盐一百五十万斤，熬硝六万零七百余斤；结合面户、粉坊等收入共计赚米二百一十四万三千斤。副业生产，有力的支援了农业生产，半年内增加的耕牛一千一百五十头，大部是由副业收入买的。耕三余一的实现，更鼓舞了翻身农民的生产热情，计划下半年的副业收入，一定超出上半年。现农民正喜形于色的收割辛劳一年的果实。（林里）
