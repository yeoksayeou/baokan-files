　　Military Supply First Garment Factory
  　Organize and Record Mutual Aid Groups Well
    [Our Newspaper's Dispatch] The First Garment Factory of the Military Region Supply Department continues to deepen the movement of learning and recording well, and production work has advanced by leaps and bounds. Comrade Shi Guangrong, cutting cotton military uniform fronts, increased from 130 sets per day to 146 sets. Comrade Niu Suozhu worked hard to cut 150 sets, and Comrade Shi Guangrong was not convinced and quickly caught up. Comrade Cao, a younger comrade, cutting military cap fronts, increased from 800 caps per day to 900 caps. Comrade Cui Sinuo added fuel and caught up to 950 caps. Comrade Liu Milu did not say a word, and with a burst of energy cut 1,000 caps. Comrade Hu Xiaoliu had even greater enthusiasm, using his midday break to sharpen his scissors, cutting 1,100 caps in one day. Wang Jingzhong, the leader of the cutting group, in order to promote continued production increases in the entire group, used his old scissors and gave the new scissors to others to use. The entire group's morale was even higher, and everyone competed to increase production and record well. Under the general call to learn and record well, mutual aid groups were further organized to observe each other, find each other's good points, and report them. The enthusiasm of the workers and comrades rose. The third group, making cotton-padded clothes, increased from an average of ten sets per machine per day to fourteen sets. Jin Hai of the sixth group quickly repaired a machine that had broken down and stopped, and joined the production with a whirring sound. Comrade Shen Wenxi continued to work despite a stomach ache. When the pain became unbearable, he drank some boiled water, endured the pain, and climbed back onto the machine, thus going to the leader with illness, increasing from 80 pieces a day to 105 pieces. Comrade Wang Cunjin of the fifth group returned from a trip and saw everyone working actively. Although his feet and legs were sore, he did not rest and immediately went to the production front the next day. Inspector Cui Yinsuo was busy inspecting at noon without taking a break. Storekeeper Gong Changwen cared about public property and inspected the warehouse in the rain. After Comrade Sun Pei of the dyehouse opened up a new path of carrying double buckets with both hands, comrades spontaneously formed a movement that spread throughout the dyehouse. Even Zhang Yonglin, an 18-year-old apprentice, participated in the movement of carrying double buckets with both hands. At the workers' congress, forty comrades were commended and recorded well. Currently, the movement of learning and recording well is developing vigorously forward. (Ge Qin)
