Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, August 8th: A report from Prague states that the Egyptian youth delegation participating in the International Youth Day conference reported at the conference that they had been obstructed and arrested by the Egyptian government on their way to the meeting. This aroused unanimous anger among the delegations of various countries towards the Egyptian government. On the 5th, Egyptian representative Yin Gaifu Leitan, who had just been released from prison and rushed to the conference, read a memorandum at a press conference in Prague in which the Sudanese youth of Egypt condemned the anti-democratic actions of the Egyptian government, stating: Egyptian and Sudanese youth demand the immediate and complete withdrawal of foreign troops from Egypt and Sudan.
