　　Xinhua News Agency, Northeast, 16th: The construction of school education in the Northeast Liberated Areas has achieved brilliant accomplishments in the past year. The entire region has a total of 10,385 large, medium, and small schools, including 102 universities and middle schools, 3 normal schools, with a total of 40,065 students, and 10,280 primary schools with 884,519 students. In addition, there are nearly 20 cadre schools with thousands of students. The vast majority of schools have fully implemented the new democratic education system, cultivating young cadres who serve the people, breaking the old semi-feudal and semi-colonial school system of Chiang Kai-shek. As a result, students actively participate in land reform and support the front lines. According to recent incomplete statistics, students in various regions who participate in social activities and practical work during their spare time account for 70% of the total number of students, and 7,000 outstanding young cadres have emerged. Since last summer, primary and secondary schools in various regions have generally been changed to private-run with public assistance. School equipment and various courses are determined based on the actual needs of the local area, and the number of children of emancipated peasants entering schools is increasing daily. For example, in a complete primary school in Ning'an County, Songjiang, the number of classes has increased from 14 to 27 in the past year. The treatment of teachers and staff in various regions has improved daily, and their social status has been enhanced. As a result, the number of teachers and staff has gradually increased. According to recent incomplete statistics, the total number of teachers and staff in the entire region has reached 19,997 in the past year.

  　学校教育获重大成就
    【新华社东北十六日电】东北解放区一年来学校教育建设已获光辉成就。全区共计大中小学为一万零三百八十五所，内计有大中学校一百零二所，师范三所，共有学生四万零六十五名，小学校一万零二百八十所，学生八十八万四千五百十九名；另有干部学校近二十所，学生数千人。绝大部分学校已完全实行民主教育的新学制，造育为人民服务的青年干部，打破了蒋介石的半封建半殖民地的旧学制，因之学生们对土地改革及支援前线工作均积极参加。据最近不完全统计，各地学生于课余参加社会活动及实际工作者，即占学生总数的百分之七十，涌现出优秀青年干部达七千人。去年夏天以来，各地中小学已普遍改为民办公助，学校设备及各种课程皆以适合于当地的实际需要而定，翻身农民子弟入校者日增。如松江宁安县的一个完全小学，一年来即由十四个班增加到二十七个班。各地教职员待遇日有改善，社会地位提高，因之教职员人数逐渐增加，据最近不完全统计：一年来全区教职员总数已有一万九千九百九十七人。
