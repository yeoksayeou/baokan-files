　　Xinhua News Agency, Jin Sui, 22nd. The Communist Party branch of Watang Village, Fifth District of Xing County, has set a precedent by seeking review by the masses before admitting new Party members. The village had publicly reviewed Party members during the land re-investigation, establishing a high prestige for the Party among the masses. Kang Wutong, a member of the Poor Peasants' League, Kang Mouci, the head of the Farmers' Association group, and Kang Meier and Kang Yin'er, the militia squad leader, all four requested to join the Party to the Communist Party branch at a mass meeting. The branch first asked the masses to review them. The masses assessed that all four had met the conditions for joining the Party. In particular, Kang Mouci was selfless and admirable. He only had three mu of paddy fields himself, but gave up two mu in exchange for dry land to help poor people to stand up. It was pointed out that Kang Wutong was active and responsible in his work and helped the masses solve many difficulties, but he should tell his wife to stop colluding with the landlord's wife. The Communist Party branch accepted the opinions of the masses and admitted the four into the Party.

　　兴县吸收党员先经群众审查
    【新华社晋绥二十二日电】兴县五区瓦塘村中共支部开创先例，吸收党员先请群众审查。该村在土地复查中曾公开审查党员，在群众中建立了党的崇高威信。贫农团委员康五同、农会小组长康谋此及康梅儿、民兵小队长康引儿，四人当在群众大会上向中共支部请求入党，支部就先请群众审查，群众评定四人都已具备入党条件，尤其是康谋此大公无私令人钦佩，他自己只有水地三亩，却让出两亩换成旱地，以帮助贫苦群众翻身，指出康五同工作积极负责，帮群众解决了不少困难，但他应叫他老婆不再和地主女人勾扯。中共支部当接受群众意见，吸收四人入党。
