　　Xinhua News Agency, Jinji-Luyu, 16th: Chiang Kai-shek's planes frantically bombed the Yellow River dikes, causing floodwaters to rush out. In Juan and Yun counties, over a hundred villages have now been flooded. Disaster victims struggling for survival in the floodwaters were also subjected to strafing by Chiang Kai-shek's planes, a truly tragic situation. A reporter made a special trip to the disaster area on the 3rd for investigation. Just upon arriving at Gao Cai and Liu Zhuang in the tenth district of Yunbei (newly established county north of Yuncheng), two Chiang Kai-shek planes circled overhead again. Villager Wang Ruiying grabbed the reporter and tearfully said, "Look, the six mu of sorghum and soybeans I was allocated are all flooded! If it weren't for that good-for-nothing Chiang Kai-shek, this year would have been great!" He had already received 14,000 yuan in relocation expenses from the democratic government. When the reporter arrived at Liu Zhuang, where the water was deepest, only the highest small house in the village was visible. Waterman Qu Jifu cursed, "All forty-some households in the village are flooded. I rowed a boat to rescue people, and just after rescuing six, two were wounded by Chiang Kai-shek's planes." Along the dike to Yunbei, the reporter saw only homeless disaster victims. The reporter was strafed by Chiang Kai-shek's planes three times within sixty li. In Wu Xizhuang, the reporter witnessed disaster victim Qian Jiuhe and his daughter being shot and killed by Chiang Kai-shek's machine guns. Section Chief Wang of the Dongchangzhi Repair Section told the reporter that on the 2nd, Chiang Kai-shek's planes bloodily washed the Yangu Ferry, killing and wounding thirteen disaster victims. Assistant Jia Yingkui of the repair section led disaster victims in a relocation effort. When the boat reached the middle of the river, it was hit and sunk, and all twenty-eight people on board were swallowed by the waves.
    Xinhua News Agency, Jinji-Luyu, 16th: In recent days, Chiang Kai-shek's planes have been dispatched day and night, seven or eight at a time, taking turns frantically bombing and strafing the laborers transporting stones and repairing dikes on both banks of the Yellow River from Pingyin to Juancheng. From August 4th to August 8th, in just four days, according to incomplete statistics, a total of over ninety bombs were dropped, killing and wounding thirty-nine laborers transporting stones and repairing dikes, destroying seventy-three civilian houses, and damaging many stone dams at the Weishan dangerous works in Dong'a. On the 4th, two Chiang Kai-shek planes flew low over ShouZhang City, dropping four bombs and strafing for an hour, wounding three laborers transporting stones and destroying thirteen civilian houses. At 6:00 p.m. on the same day, the Dong'a Engineering Team led the masses to throw stones to reinforce the Weishan dangerous works when six Chiang Kai-shek planes circled overhead and bombed frantically, destroying many sections of the stone dam. Fortunately, rescue efforts were timely, averting a disaster. At the Liying and other dangerous works in Pingyin County, from the 2nd to the 6th, the water was raging, and the stone dams were in imminent danger. The masses were nervously throwing stones to rescue them, but Chiang Kai-shek's planes continued to bomb the area indiscriminately for four days, wounding workers Li Huarong and others. On the 5th, the Zaose Lou dangerous works in the fourth district of ShouZhang was attacked by two Chiang Kai-shek planes, and Jiang Chuanbao, a laborer transporting stones, suffered a severe head injury, and three livestock were killed. On the 6th, the Huangdi north of Yuncheng was strafed by three Chiang Kai-shek planes in turns, killing and wounding eight of our workers. On the 7th, eight Chiang Kai-shek planes bombed the villages of Ye Lou and Dai Miao on the south bank of the Henan River, dropping seventy-two bombs, wounding fourteen dike repair workers, and collapsing thirty-odd houses. On the night of the 8th, Chiang Kai-shek's planes bombed ShouZhang City and Zhangqiu Town again, dropping fourteen bombs, destroying thirty houses in ShouZhang City, seriously wounding two people, and slightly wounding three people, and killing five people in Zhangqiu Town. The Sunkou dangerous works in ShouZhang has been bombed every day from the 1st to the 8th of this month. Especially on the 4th, Chiang Kai-shek's planes dropped five hundred-pound bombs there, endangering the dam that had been repaired for ten months. The masses along the river are risking their lives day and night to transport stones to repair it.
