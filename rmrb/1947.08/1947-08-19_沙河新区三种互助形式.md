　　Three Forms of Mutual Aid in the Shahe New District
　　[Report from our reporters on the 17th] Our reporters studied several mutual aid groups in Shahe and discovered that the mutual aid organizations in the Linxing New District can be roughly divided into three types, each with its own conditions and functions. One type is of a contract-labor nature. When farm work is busy and sideline occupations are most in need of money, several people help each other. Those engaged in sideline occupations contract all their land to those who farm at home, stipulating that the land must be well cultivated and paying a certain amount of wages. Those who contract the land can concentrate on outside production. The contractors also greatly improve their labor efficiency due to the nature of piecework wages, and both agricultural and sideline industries can be done well. Another type is simple exchange of labor, with all labor forces organized to achieve the goal of rushing to plow and sow under the conditions of the busiest farm work, a shortage of both manpower and animal power, and no mutual aid foundation. However, this type is not easy to be of equal value, and problems will inevitably arise after a long time. This is a low-level, necessary stage. It can practically make the masses realize the benefits of mutual aid. By continuing to solve the problem of voluntary equivalence, it can be gradually improved. The third type is in the form of wages, which is actually a shortened labor system. After the people who turned over a new leaf and the old, young, lonely, and childless people who had no labor force deposited the fruits in the cooperative to generate interest, a portion of the dividends was extracted to pay those who cultivated the land. This is most common in areas where labor is not greatly lacking. The disadvantage is that these old, young, and childless people have not been organized into mutual aid production. Step by step, everyone with skills can be organized. These people can also do some production. At that time, labor can be exchanged for labor, and instead of paying money, work points can be given, which will become a higher-level mutual aid organization.

　　沙河新区三种互助形式
    【本报记者团十七日电】记者研究沙河若干互助组，发现新区临性的互助组织，大体上可分三种，各有各的条件与作用，一种是包工性质，在农活较忙又是副业最需钱时，几个人互助起来，搞副业的，把自己全部土地包给在家种地的人，言明把这些地种好，付多少工资，搞副业的，安心外出生产。包工者，因计件工资性质，亦大大加强自己的劳动效率，农副两业，均可作好。一种是在农事最忙，人畜力两缺，又无互助基础的条件下，为了达到抢耕抢种的目的，组织全部劳力实行简单换工，但此种不易等价，时间久了，必生问题。这是一种低级的必经阶段。它能从切实上，使群众认识互助的好处，继续解决自愿的等价问题，即可逐步提高。一种是工资形式，实际是缩短工性质，翻身后无劳力的老幼孤独，把果实存在合作社中生利，抽出一部红利给人耕种。在劳力不大缺乏的地区，最为一遍。缺点是未能把这些老幼组织到生产中互助，逐步发展把有一技之长的一切人，都组织进来，这些人亦可作一些生产，那时工变工，改付钱给工票，即成为较高的互助组织。
