(Hukuan News) To promote the great production movement, Xujiahou Village in the Third District of Hukuan County has recently launched a "Record Good Deeds, Learn from Good Examples" campaign. In the past, many people felt it was not easy to achieve merit. Some said, "We can't do it, we can't achieve merit." After studying the issue, everyone decided that in the future, they should move from good deeds to merit, and from merit to becoming a hero. If there is a good deed, record it. If not one good deed, then another. If not three good deeds, then at least one. Each time a work task is completed, see who has the most good deeds, and give rewards accordingly. It is stipulated that each mutual aid team should record good deeds every half month, convert them into merits after completing a season's work, and then see who is a hero or model after the autumn harvest. On the afternoon of July 26th, taking advantage of the rain, the whole village summarized the current production and preparedness work, and launched a campaign to "Report Good Deeds, Record Good Deeds, and Learn from Good Examples." Xu Jubao said, "We must discuss this carefully. Don't conceal any good deeds. Say everything you can. If you don't have good deeds this time, strive for them next time." Xu Liuxing's wife said, "I say the old farmers' association is the best. They lead everyone far away from the village, day and night. Their attitude is good, their leadership in collecting is good, and their family savings are good." After each small team reported their good deeds, they were reported and recorded at a general meeting. Twenty-one people in the village were recorded for one good deed, thirty-one for two, fourteen for three, eight for four, and five for five. After the commendations, everyone was in high spirits and striving to record more good deeds.

　　集“好”成“功”
  　徐家后村推动生产
    【本报壶关讯】壶关三区徐家后村，为推动大生产运动，近开展了记好学好运动。过去有不少人感到立个功不容易，有的说：“咱可不行，立不上个功。”大家研究，今后要由好到功，由功到英雄，有一点好就记一点好，没这点好有那点好，没三个好有一个好，每到一段工作完成时，看看谁的好多，分等进行奖励，规定今后各变工队半月记一次好，完成一季工作时，再折成功，秋后再看谁是英雄模范。七月二十六号下午趁天下雨，全村群众总结当前生产备荒工作，开展报好、记好、学好。徐聚保说：“这咱可得好好讨论，有好不昧，有一点说出一点来，这次没好下次争好。”徐刘兴妻说：“我说人家老农会顶好，白天黑夜领导大家离村多远一直跑，态度好，带领采采好，家里节约好。”这样各小队展开表好后，在大会上报好记好，全村记一个好的二十一人，记两个的三十一人，记三个好的十四人，记四个好的八人，记五个好的五人。表好后，大家情绪很高，争取多记好。　　　　　　　　　（马如龙、徐松根）
