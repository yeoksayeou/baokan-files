International Week

　　Conspiracy, infighting, hope, and light intertwined into a tense and complex international situation this week.

　　The Security Council issued a note to the Netherlands and Indonesia demanding an immediate ceasefire. Before the Security Council could further decide on what "arbitration method" to adopt to mediate the dispute between the two sides, Marshall, in China, was about to re-enact a bankrupt "mediation on one hand, helping the war on the other hand" conspiracy drama in Indonesia. After repeated consultations between the U.S. State Department and Dutch representatives, on the 5th, a separate "mediation" proposal was submitted to the Indonesian side, attempting to block the Security Council from conducting arbitration; at the same time, on the third day of the ceasefire taking effect, the International Bank for Reconstruction and Development, manipulated by the United States, announced a huge loan of 195 million U.S. dollars to the Netherlands. With the aid of this two-faced policy of the American swindler, the Netherlands, while declaring a ceasefire, continued its offensive. Since the ceasefire order took effect on the 4th, it has successively occupied five cities in Indonesia and is continuing to prepare for a large-scale invasion.

　　However, the Indonesian government saw through the conspiracy of the United States and the Netherlands, and sternly rejected the U.S.'s attempt at separate "mediation," insisting that "the United Nations jointly arbitrate," and proposed six legitimate demands, including the withdrawal of forces from both sides to the demarcation line stipulated on October 14, 1946, as a guarantee for the ceasefire. At the same time, the Standing Committee of the Indonesian Parliament passed the government's policy of resolute resistance on the 9th. This shows that Marshall's old trick is being bankrupted again, just like in China.

　　Chiang Kai-shek, the traitorous head of China, once again performed a slave farce on the Indonesian issue, flattering his American master with "consistent steps" to show his "red heart of loyalty." Since the Netherlands launched its war of aggression, Chiang's mouthpiece, the Central News Agency, has repeatedly spread rumors and slandered, describing the Indonesian People's Army's self-defense war as "looting" and "besieging" overseas Chinese, doing its best to provoke the overseas Chinese to hate Indonesia, and even madly demanded that the Dutch invading army be stationed in Indonesia permanently. However, Chiang's reckless actions will not affect the Chinese people's sympathy and support for the Indonesian national independence war in the slightest. The Indonesian government stated on the 8th that all propaganda about the so-called "persecution of overseas Chinese" is a provocative conspiracy by Dutch imperialists.

　　In the past week, the United States has been stepping up its support for Japanese financial groups to use them as tools for its expansion. U.S. authorities recently approved Japanese businessmen to go abroad to handle "foreign" trade, and a U.S. business delegation to visit Japan to investigate the development of U.S.-Japan trade. The U.S. Department of the Army has taken concrete actions to restore Japan's wool weaving industry to pre-war levels. The U.S. Rehabilitation Assistance Bank openly granted huge loans to Japanese large industries. At present, Japanese goods are ready or have begun to be exported to China, Britain, India, Australia, the Philippines, Siam, and other countries. China's national industry and Britain and its autonomous territories will be the first to suffer and will inevitably rise up to resist.

　　Britain's economic crisis, "the hull of which is already heavily biased to one side," has plunged the Labor government into a precarious situation. The foreign exchange deficit reached 1.62 billion U.S. dollars in the first half of this year, and Britain now has only 2.4 billion U.S. dollars in its final reserves. The Labor government originally planned to spend the American 3.75 billion loan over five years, but due to the high prices in the United States, it has depreciated by half, making it difficult to get through even the end of this year. This even forced Attlee to lament in distress: "Britain is in a state of danger and anxiety." In order to save this deep crisis, the British government drafted an "emergency measure," which Attlee reported to the House of Commons on the 6th. This "emergency measure" stipulates increasing workers' working hours, opposing wage increase requests, and reducing a small number of troops. Therefore, it is obviously intended to shift the burden of the economic crisis onto the hard-working workers. Although Attlee called for "self-reliance" in his report, he still did not abandon the illusion of "further help from the Marshall Plan." This "emergency measure" of wanting "workers to eat less and work more" (AFP language) and fantasizing about American aid cannot pull Britain out of the abyss of the economic crisis. Therefore, it caused an uproar in the House of Commons debate, causing "dissatisfaction within the Labor Party to continue to grow."

　　The economic crisis in the United States is also becoming increasingly tense. Even according to official U.S. statistics, exports in June decreased by 13 percent compared to May, showing "the first major interruption in the upward trend of exports." At the same time, the industrial production index has fallen from the post-war peak of 190 to 183 in June of this year. According to Varga, a Soviet economic authority, "the preconditions for the U.S. economic crisis are maturing, and it is very likely that it has already begun."

　　The precarious economic situation of Britain and the United States (France is the same) has formed the complexity of the contradictions and infighting between them. In order to save its imminent economic crisis, the United States decided to step up the implementation of the Marshall Plan, pressuring Britain to immediately participate in the Anglo-American Ruhr coal area conference, and arranged a set of scams to try to exclude France from the talks, isolate Britain, and thus make it easier to subdue. As a result, it aroused the dissatisfaction and anger of Britain and France.

　　In order to ease France's resentment, Marshall sent a letter to Bidault, which is said to have indicated that France could participate in the meeting if the telegram was translated from English into French, but U.S. Army Secretary Royal showed a soldier's "frankness" and revealed that "there is no U.S.-France agreement that a decision must be made after consultation with France first," and when reporters questioned the contradiction between Marshall and Royal's statements, Marshall even said in a swindler's tone: "I don't remember and want to seal the original." The indignant British Foreign Office spokesman publicly declared on the 9th: Opposing France's participation is tantamount to "anti-British and anti-French." At the same time, it made various gestures to ask the United States for a price: saying it wanted to withdraw troops from Germany, restrict the import of American goods, and the Ruhr coal production conference would be postponed. The French diplomatic community also expressed "great agitation" over Royal's statement. In this situation, the United States had to play another set of swindler-style magic, on the one hand, expressing to Britain its agreement to discuss relaxing the terms of the American loan to Britain, but the location and time of the meeting were not determined; it even expressed that it could provide Britain with a short-term loan of 325 million U.S. dollars, so as to make Britain hook up. On the other hand, it allowed France to participate in the Ruhr talks, but it is said that France was only allowed to raise objections to the issue of raising Germany's industrial level, to which the French side has expressed "not completely satisfied." Up to now, although the U.S. side has announced that the Anglo-American Ruhr conference will be held on the 12th, the infighting between Britain, France, and the United States is still unfolding with extraordinary intensity.

　　Standing outside of panic and conspiracy, the Soviet economy is booming. Industrial production in July once again completed and exceeded the plan as usual, with thousands of factories completing their plans for August and even September, and even starting production in October. This once again proves the infinite vitality of the socialist system and encourages all people fighting for democracy. At the same time, the friendly mutual assistance among the countries of Southeast Europe has greatly developed. The signing of the South-Bulgaria Treaty of Friendship and Mutual Assistance, as Dimitrov said, makes the Balkans "no longer a powder keg of Europe, but a fortress of peace and democracy for Europe and the world." This article, together with the Soviet-Polish and Soviet-Yugoslav trade agreements signed this week, along with the more than ten barter agreements signed between the Soviet Union and Southeast European countries in January, guarantees the smooth realization of the planned economy and national prosperity of the Southeast European countries. The Soviet Union and Southeast Europe have today become beacons of hope and light for humanity. (Xinhua News Agency)

### 美英法经济情势危急暗斗益烈　苏与东南欧已成人类光明灯塔

　　美英法经济情势危急暗斗益烈
  　苏与东南欧已成人类光明灯塔
    阴谋、暗斗、希望、光明，交织成一周来紧张而复杂的国际局面。
    安理会向荷印两国发出立即停战的照会复，在安理会尚未进一步决定采取何项“仲裁方式”调停双方争端以前，马歇尔在中国将经破产的“一面调停，一面助战”的阴谋剧，又由同一个马歇尔企图在印尼重演一遍。美国务院与荷兰代表一再商谈后，已于五日向印尼方面提出单独的“斡旋”建议，力图阻塞安理会进行仲裁；同时在停战生效第三日，美国操纵下的国际建设开发银行却宣布予荷兰一亿九千五百万美元的巨额贷款。在美国骗子的这种两面政策援助下，荷兰一面宣称停战，一面却继续进攻。自四日停战令生效之时起，迄今已先后侵占印尼五城；并在继续布置大规模进犯中。
    但是，印尼政府方面看破了美荷的阴谋，严正拒绝美国单独“调停”企图，坚主“由联合国共同仲裁”，并提出双方武力撤至一九四六年十月十四日规定之分界线等六项正当要求，作为停战之保证。同时，印尼国会常务委员会已于九日通过政府的坚决抗战的政策。这说明马歇尔故技正象在中国一样重遭破产。
    中国卖国头子蒋介石，在印尼问题上又表演了一幕奴隶丑剧，以“一致步调”献媚美国主子，图表一表其“赤子忠心”。自荷兰发动侵略战争以来，蒋贼喉舌中央社会一再造谣中伤，把印尼人民军的自卫战，描写成“洗劫”、“围困”华侨，极力挑拨侨胞仇视印尼，且丧心病狂要求荷兰侵略军永驻印尼。但是蒋贼此种妄举，绝不能丝毫影响中国人民对印尼民族独立战争的同情与声援。印尼政府已于八日声明，所有关于所谓“迫害华侨”的宣传，全系荷兰帝国主义者的挑拨阴谋。
    过去一周，美国正加紧通过对日本财阀之扶植，以充作其扩张之工具。美当局最近批准了日本商人出国办理“对外”贸易，及美商人代表团赴日考察发展美日贸易事宜，美陆军部更采取具体行动，恢复日本毛织业至战前水平。美复原资助银行公然予日本大工业以巨额贷款。目前，日货已准备或开始向中、英、印、澳、菲暹等国输出。中国民族工业与英国及其自治领将首当其害而势必奋起抗争。
    “船身已沉重地偏向一方”的英国经济危机，使工党政府陷入摇摇欲坠中。外汇缺绌，今年上半年即达十六亿二千万美元，英国现在最后的储备金仅有二十四亿美元。工党政府原拟花用五年的美国三十七亿五千万贷款，由于美物价之高涨而跌价一半，从而甚至很难渡过今年年底。这连艾德礼也不得不苦恼地喊出：“英国是处在危险与焦虑状态中。”为了拯救这一深重的危机，英政府拟就了一个“紧急措施”，由艾德礼于六日向下院报告。这个“紧急措施”规定增加工人工作时间，反对增资要求及裁减少量军队等。因此，显然欲将经济危机的重担转嫁到劳苦的工人身上；艾德礼报告中虽呼吁“自力更生”，但仍未抛弃幻想“马歇尔计划的进一步帮助”。这种要“工人少吃饭多做工”（法新社语）和幻想美国援助的“紧急措施”是不能把英国从经济危机的深渊中挣脱出来的，因此在下院辩论时引起了轩然大波，使“工党内不满的情绪仍在生长中”。
    美国的经济危机也日趋紧张，即使根据美官方的统计，六月份的输出比五月份已减少百分之十三，出现了“输出上升趋势中首次重大中断”。同时，工业生产量指数已自战后最高产量的一九○跌到本年六月的一八三。据苏联经济学权威瓦尔加估计，“美国经济危机的前提条件正在成熟，甚至很可能已经开始。”
    英美（法国亦同样）这种岌岌可危的经济情势，形成了它们之间矛盾与暗斗的复杂性。美国为了拯救其即将临头的经济危机，决定加紧实行马歇尔计划，压迫英国迅即参加英美两国鲁尔煤区会议，并布置了一套骗局，力图排斥法国于会谈之外，孤立英国，从而使其易于就范。结果激起了英法的不满与愤怒。
    为了缓和法国的愤懑情绪，马歇尔曾致函欺＠比道尔，据说该电由英文译成法文就会表示法国可以参加会议，但美陆长罗雅尔却表现了一番军人的“率直”，泄露“并不存在必先与法国商讨方作决定之美法协议”，而当记者质询马歇尔与罗雅尔之间谈话的矛盾时，马歇尔竟以骗子的口吻称：“记不清楚而要查封原文。”愤懑的英国外交部发言人九日公开宣称：反对法国参加即等于“反英反法”。同时作出种种姿态向美国索价：说要从德国部分撤军呀，限制美货入口呀，鲁尔煤产会议又将延期呀。法国外交界对罗雅尔声明也表示“极大的激动”。在此种情形下，美国又不得不再玩一套骗子式的魔术，一面对英国表示同意商谈放宽美国对英贷款条件，但会议地点及时间均未确定；甚至表示可供给英国三亿二千五百万美元之短期贷款，藉便使英国上钩。另一面则照着法国参加鲁尔会谈，但据悉仅允许法国对提高德国工业水平一事提出异议，法方对此已表示“不能完全满意”。迄今为止，英美鲁尔会议虽由美方公布即将于十二日召开，但英法美之间的暗斗仍在异常激烈的展开中。
    站在恐慌与阴谋之外，苏联的经济却蒸蒸日上。七月份工业生产又照例完成并超过计划，千百个工厂完成八月份以至九月份计划，甚至已开始十月份的生产了。这再一次证明社会主义制度的无限活力，而鼓舞着一切为民主斗争的人民。同时东南欧各国间的友好互助更大大发展了，南保友好互助条约之签订，如季米特洛夫所说，使巴尔干“不再是欧洲的火药库，而变成为欧洲与世界和平民主的堡垒”。这一条是与本周内签订的苏波、苏南贸易协定，连同过去一月中在苏联与东南欧国家间订立的十多种易货协定，保证了东南欧各国计划经济与国家繁荣的顺利实现。苏联与东南欧今天已成为人类希望与光明的灯塔。（新华社）
