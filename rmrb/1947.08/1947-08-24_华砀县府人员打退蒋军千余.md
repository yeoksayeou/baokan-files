(Delayed dispatch from this newspaper's correspondent in the border area of Hebei, Shandong and Henan on the 15th) Personnel from the Hua and Dang County government repelled over a thousand enemy reinforcements. On the evening of July 14th, the entire 33rd Regiment of the Chiang army's 58th Division, numbering over a thousand men, were en route to reinforce the Chiang troops besieged at Yangshan when they passed through the Wu Liu District of our Hua and Dang County. Our work team and the county government personnel stationed in the village discovered the enemy. They exchanged fire briefly before retreating to underground tunnels to continue fighting, preventing the enemy from advancing. Before long, the enemy appeared on the high ground. Comrade Jian Zhang and others, brave and composed, shot down five attacking enemies in one go. Simultaneously, over thirty enemies attacking from the north side of the village were engaged by Comrade Hong Deshan from another bunker, who shot down one enemy soldier. The enemy formation immediately became chaotic, running and yelling, and they all fled into the sorghum fields. From the bunker opposite, Comrade Hong Ce-zhen and others fired three shots, hitting two enemies. The enemy commander shouted, "Use machine guns!" but couldn't find the target. Another shot from the bunker hit the enemy machine gunner, and the remaining enemies fled in utter disarray. After a while, the enemy opened fire, with machine guns and artillery simultaneously firing into the village. The comrades defending the bunkers remained calm and shot down another nine enemies in one go. They held their ground until 9:00 PM, when the enemy, having exhausted all options, dragged away over ten corpses and fled back the way they came, with over a thousand men in a panic. We suffered no casualties.

　　华砀县府人员打退蒋军千余
    【本报冀鲁豫十五日电】（迟到）华砀县府人员打退敌援兵千余。七月十四日晚，蒋军五十八师三十三团全部千余人，增援羊山被围蒋军时，路经我华砀县吴溜区，我住在该村的工作组和县政府发现敌人，打了一阵枪，就转移至地道作战，阻止敌人前进。不一会敌人就从高地里露出头来了，我英勇沉着的建章等同志，一气打倒了五个进攻的敌人。同时，从庄北边进攻的三十多个敌人，被另一个堡垒的洪德山同志打倒一个，顿时敌人队形混乱，乱跑乱叫，全部跑高粱地里。对面暗堡的洪策振等同志，三枪打倒了二个敌人。敌人的指挥官高叫：“用机枪打！”但找不到目标。暗堡里又放出一枪，击中了敌机枪手，其余的敌人屁滚尿流的跑开了。又过了一会，敌人就开展火力，机枪和炮同时向村内打来，坚持地堡的同志都很沉着，一气又打倒了九个敌人，一直坚持到下午九时，敌人无计可施，拖着十余具死尸，千余人仓惶的向来路窜，而我无一伤亡。
