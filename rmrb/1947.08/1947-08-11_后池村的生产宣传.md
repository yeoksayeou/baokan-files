　　Production Propaganda in Houchi Village
    Wang Lanbang
  　I. Everyone Wants to Be on the Radio
    The radio station is one of the most powerful weapons in Houchi's propaganda work. The village has one main station and five branch stations. Announcers are organized from college students and young cadres from the school. The main station is directly controlled by the teachers and broadcasts every other night. The masses can hear it even sitting in their homes. Because the broadcasts cannot be detailed, each street also has propagandists who conduct propaganda and explanation after the broadcast, making it easier for the masses to accept. The exemplary deeds of model figures are broadcast and praised by the radio station. Therefore, everyone wants to be on the radio.
    During the autumn harvest last year, Liu Tubao proposed that women should not rely on men, threshing the grain themselves and carrying the bags back; helping men carry manure during the rush planting. After these materials were broadcast that evening, the women clamored:
    "If others can be on the radio, why can't we? We will also work hard."
    The next day, more than a dozen women threshed the grain without men. Old Xiu's wife listened to the broadcast and even went to the fields to carry manure and plow the land for her man. When models were discovered in this way, all the women in the village took action, unwilling to fall behind, so that the autumn harvest and wheat planting were completed ahead of schedule.
    When mobilizing for production and frugality, Labor Hero Liu Shiyan first formulated a plan and broadcast it on the radio. Under his influence, all 221 households in the village quickly formulated their own plans, causing the village to universally lower its living standards. Since the establishment of the radio station, the village has reduced meetings, and general matters are communicated to the masses through the radio station, saving a lot of time.
  　II. Being Praised in the Newspaper Led the Way
    The village has three mass blackboard newspapers and a mobile newsletter that comes out every ten days. The mass blackboard is changed every other day or every day, and the content mainly includes the central work of the village and important current events. The most common writing form is快板 (clapper talk), because快板 (clapper talk) is easy to remember and the masses love to listen to it, which can develop the creative wisdom of the masses. In terms of material collection, the village has a communications team, and each street center has a communications column. The correspondents and the masses write out the materials when they have time (those who cannot write find someone to write for them) and post them on the communications column, truly achieving the goal of the masses running the newspaper and the masses reading the newspaper. Every afternoon, the teachers go to each communications column to collect materials, revise them in the evening, and post the usable ones on the blackboard newspaper or旬报 (ten-day report). The ones that are not used are revised in red pen and then posted next to the original communications column, which is very helpful to the correspondents.
    In the most central part of the village, there is a reading room where the Xinhua Daily, the county newsletter, and the village newsletter are hung. Every day at meal times, or when the masses walk to the fields, they stop to see who has been reported in the newspaper, and the propagandists take the opportunity to carry out propaganda and explanation. In addition, the newsletter is also passed around to various people's schools. The masses love to listen to the materials about the village and county in the Xinhua Daily and the praises of model figures in the village newsletter the most. In this way, the masses are naturally driven to compete in their work, and everyone wants to be reported, believing that being reported is the most glorious.
    In addition to the general propaganda on the streets and at meal times, the mass blackboard is placed on the main road at the entrance of the village during the busy farming season. Every afternoon, when the masses walk back from the fields, the college students and teachers from the school are responsible for the propaganda. Therefore, every evening, the newspaper is surrounded by masses listening, and some even forget to go home for dinner. When some mutual aid teams find model figures working in the fields, the team leader first runs to the blackboard and tells the teacher, who immediately compiles it and writes it on the blackboard, so that the masses can know about the materials discovered in the afternoon by the evening. Some of the masses find it inexplicable and say, "People's news is really well-informed, like having a radio. We work in the fields, and people at home know about it." Many tasks are promoted through such propaganda.
    During the rush hoeing of seedlings last year, many male laborers were sick, and the plan could only be completed by organizing women to go to the fields. One day, a group of women, Zheng Rongde, said in a work report at the people's school: "I hoeed six or seven minutes of seedlings today." The teacher compiled this material into a快板 (clapper talk) and posted it on the blackboard newspaper and newsletter. The people's school then went everywhere to promote and encourage the women. Except for those who were sick or giving birth, all were involved in this movement. Liu Tuying's 60-year-old mother also participated, hoeing one and a half acres in three days. In this way, some groups completed the plan ahead of schedule. Eighty-six participating women hoeed 320 acres of seedlings.
    In the seedling hoeing competition, after the fourth group completed it ahead of schedule, Li Baozhen led seven women to chop firewood for the families of revolutionary soldiers, chopping 1,180 catties in one day. Under their influence, 116 women were also involved in this movement, chopping firewood for a total of three and a half days, with the village chopping more than 110,000 catties of firewood. When a group of women saw that the women of the sixth and fourth groups took the lead in hoeing seedlings and chopping firewood, they said: "Why can't we set an example and be praised?" So Liu Huaye and others got up early the next day, took dry food, and followed the cattle to pick up manure, piling it all in the fields of the families of revolutionary soldiers. The Production Education Committee immediately compiled a快板 (clapper talk) to praise them. After this news spread, all the women in the village took action. The women of the eighth group, Li Xuelan, mobilized the women in the group to clean the streets, which not only promoted hygiene but also accumulated fertilizer. They first cleaned their own doorsteps and then cleaned other streets. Zhao Suzhen of the fifth group saw that her doorstep was being cleaned and felt ashamed, so she argued with Li Xueyun, saying, "I can sweep my own door, who needs you to do it!" In this way, no one wanted to fall behind, and everyone scrambled to be reported, cleaning all the streets and alleys of the village in half a day. In less than half a day, the fertilizer accumulation task of 116 women was completed immediately.
  　III. Two快板 (clapper talk) That Broke Through Ideological Obstacles
    Houchi Village has been doing well in production over the years, with the village averaging耕二余一 (plow two remainder one), and the masses are living prosperous lives. Therefore, when the mobilization for production and frugality began, everyone was indifferent and could not make any progress. Later, everyone wrote a生产的快板 (clapper talk of production) for the labor hero Liu Shiyan:
    Labor hero Liu Shiyan,
    His plan is really brilliant,
    Seeing that there is no rain in the drought,
    The savings plan is clearly set.
    His family has six people,
    Three men and three women,
    The family has three dan of rice in storage,
    Two dan and zero of corn and wheat,
    The corn and wheat are converted into rice,
    A total of 1,300 catties,
    The whole family eats four catties of rice every day,
    Can eat until April next year,
    Saving two taels every day,
    Can still be eaten for three months,
    Calculated until the end of July next year,
    Can do without this year's harvest,
    Intensify production and set a plan,
    The whole family's labor must be divided,
    In addition to farming, labor is spent,
    There are still 150 workdays left,
    One workday is six catties of rice,
    A total of 900 catties of millet,
    Equivalent to 18,000 yuan,
    Prepared to buy a donkey for mutual assistance.
    His woman also sets a plan,
    Can spin three taels of cotton a day,
    His mother takes care of the children for him,
    Weaving white cloth is top-notch,
    Weaves 64 catties of cloth a year,
    Selling for 96,000 yuan,
    Not even a cent is missing,
    Calculated to buy seven or eight sheep,
    Raise a sow to contract the land.

    Liu Quanxin, director of the 武委会 (Armed Committee), wrote another快板 (clapper talk) titled "No More Smoking Cigarettes":
    Must plan for the future,
    Let me talk about smoking cigarettes,
    Smoking an average of one pack every two days,
    Saving money for a catty of salt every three days,
    Never thought about it carefully before,
    The family drank light porridge every day,
    Calculating the past three months,
    Smoking cigarettes cost 4,300 yuan,
    The whole family only has three people,
    Can eat salt for more than half a year,
    Thinking left and right,
    Cigarettes are really a waste of money,
    Western cigarettes become旱烟袋 (dry tobacco pipe),
    Do not use a lamp, use flint,
    Saving money for two years to buy a donkey,
    Plowing the land and grinding the mill is not difficult.
    As a result, the whole village has set a production savings plan, followed by spinning, rush planting,抢种 (rush planting), etc., which have been promoted and formed a movement.

　　后池村的生产宣传
    王兰榜
  　一、人人愿上广播台
    广播台是后池宣传工作的有力武器之一，全村有一个总电台五个分电台，广播员是由学校的大学生和青年干部组织起来的。总电台由教员直接掌握，每隔一晚一广播。群众就是在屋里坐着也可以听见。因为广播时不能详细，各街头市又组织有宣传员，上边广播下边就进行宣传解释，使群众容易接受。模范人物的模范事迹，由广播台广播表扬。因此谁也想上广播台。
    去年秋收时，刘土保提出女人不靠男人，自己打场自己往回扛布袋；在突击下种时帮助男人担大粪，这些材料当晚广播后，妇女们都嚷着：
    “人家能上广播台咱就不能上，咱也好好干”。
    次日即有十几个妇女打场不用男人。老秀老婆听了广播，还上地担粪替男人犁地。这样再从中发现模范，全村妇女就都行动起来，谁也不愿落后，使秋收种麦工作提前完成。
    动员生产节约时，先由劳英刘士炎订出计划，在电台广播宣传，在他的影响下全村二百二十一户也都很快订出自己的计划，使全村普遍降低生活水平。自建立广播台后，该村减少了开会，一般的事情都是由广播台传达给群众。节省了很多时间。
  　二、登报表扬带了头
    全村三个大众黑板报，十天出一张流动小报。大众黑板每隔一天或每天换一次，内容主要是本村中心工作和重要的时事消息，写作形式以快板为最多，因为快板顺口易记，群众爱听，能发挥群众的创作智慧。在材料搜集上，全村组织有通讯组，各街中心地方设有通讯栏，各街通讯员和群众有了材料抽空就写出来（不会写的找人代写）贴到通讯栏上，真正做到了群众办报群众看报。每天下午教员到各个通讯栏里收集一次材料，晚上修改，能用的就登到黑板报或旬报上，不采用的用红笔改后还贴到原通讯栏的旁边，这样对通讯员帮助很大。
    在全村最中心的地方设有阅报处，新华日报、县小报和本村小报，都挂在里边。每天吃饭时，或群众往地走，路过都要围着看看报上又登了谁，宣传员趁机会进行宣传解释。此外小报还要各民校传着看。群众对新华报上的本村本县材料，和本村小报上表扬模范的快板最爱听，这样推动群众在工作上很自然的形成竞赛，谁也愿意上上报，都认为上报最光荣。
    大众黑板除平时在街头饭市一般的进行宣传外，在农忙时候就把大众黑板放在村口大路上，每天下午群众从地里往回走时，学校的大学生和教员在那里负责宣传，因此每天黄昏报旁都是围着群众在听，甚至有的听的忘了回去吃饭。有的互助组在地里做活发现模范人物，组长就先跑到黑板跟前，给教员一说，当下就编出来写到黑板上，这样下午发现的材料，傍黑就能使群众都知道，有的群众觉得莫明其妙说：“人家消息真灵通，和安着无线电一样，咱在地里做活，人家在家就知道了。”好多工作都是通过这样宣传推动起来的。
    去年突击锄苗时，男劳力病了很多，只有把妇女组织起来上地才能完成计划。有一天，一组妇女郑荣德在民校里汇报工作时说：“我今天锄了六七分苗。”教员就把这个材料编成快板登到黑板报小报上，民校再到处一一宣传鼓励了妇女，除有病及生育的以外都卷入了这个运动。刘土英的六十岁的母亲也参加了，三天锄苗一亩半。这样有的组就提前完成了计划。参加的妇女八十六人锄苗三百二十亩。
    在锄苗竞赛中，第四组提前完成以后，李保珍就带领七个妇女给抗属打柴，一天打了一千一百八十斤，在她们的影响下就有一百一十六个妇女也卷入这个运动，一共打柴三天半，全村打柴一十一万多斤。一组妇女看到六、四组妇女锄苗、打柴起了带头作用，他们说：“咱就不能起个模范，叫表扬表扬？”于是刘花叶等次日起早带上干粮跟着牛群去拾粪，整整拾了一天，都堆在抗属地里，生产教育委员会就马上又编快板表扬。这个消息传出后，全村妇女都行动起来了。八组妇女李雪兰发动组内妇女打扫街道，既讲卫生又能积肥，先打扫干净自己的家庭门口，又到别的街道打扫。五组赵素珍开门看见扫自己门口，心里觉得丢了人，就和李雪芸吵着说：“俺的门俺不会扫，谁用你们哩！”这样一来谁也不愿落后，大家争着要上报，半天光景就把全村大街小巷扫了个干干净净。不到半天工夫，一百一十六个妇女的积肥任务，马上就完成了。
  　三、突破了思想障碍的两个快板
    后池村，因为历年生产搞的好，全村平均达到耕二余一，群众生活富裕，因此开始动员生产节约时，都满不在乎，怎也闹不成，后来，大家给劳动英雄刘士炎写了生产的快板：
    劳动英雄刘士炎，
    他的打算真高明，
    看到天旱不下雨，
    节约计划订的清。
    他家共有六口人，
    三个男人三女人，
    家里存米有三石，
    玉茭麦子两石零，
    玉茭麦子折成米，
    共有一千三百斤，
    每日全家吃四斤米，
    能吃到明年四月中，
    每日每天省二两，
    再吃三月用不清，
    计算到明年七月底，
    今年不收也能行，
    加紧生产订计划，
    全家劳力要分工，
    除了种地花劳力，
    还剩余一百五十工，
    一个工资六斤米，
    共产小米九百斤，
    合洋一万八千元，
    准备买驴互助用。
    他女人也定计划，
    一天能纺三两花，
    他娘给他看小孩，
    织成白布顶呱呱，
    一年织六十四斤布，
    卖洋九万六千元，
    分厘丝毫也不差，
    计算买羊七八只、
    养口母猪包地下。
    武委会主任刘全信又写了一个快板，题目叫：“再不吸纸烟”
    过时光要打算，
    听我谈谈吸纸烟，
    两天平均吸一盒，
    三天省钱秤斤盐，
    从前没有细打算，
    家里天天喝淡饭，
    算算从前三个月，
    吸纸烟化洋四千三，
    全家只有三口人，
    吃盐能吃多半年，
    左打算、右打算，
    纸烟真是浪费钱，
    洋烟变成旱烟袋，
    不使曲灯用火镰，
    节省二年买头驴，
    犁地推磨不困难。
    结果，全村都订了生产节约计划，接连着纺织、突击干种、抢种等等都被推动起来，形成运动了。
