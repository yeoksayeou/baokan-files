Xinhua News Agency, Northeast, 13th: (Delayed) In mid-June, the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Government suppressed the bandit troops of Renqindorji, a Buryat Mongol traitor (located in the southeast of Xilin Gol League). The bandit troops were completely defeated, with some captured. Ren fled to Dolon. The Autonomous Government has issued an order for his arrest and prosecution. Note: Renqindorji was a nobleman of the Buryat tribe. During the Tsarist Russian era, he was trained at the St. Petersburg Cavalry School. In 1918, he led White Russian bandits to the Hulunbuir area, and later to the Shulin Gol League. After the July 7th Incident, he colluded with the Japanese invaders, sending his children and daughters-in-law to study in Japan to show his goodwill. At that time, many Inner Mongolian anti-Japanese youths were slaughtered by Ren. After August 15th, the Kuomintang appointed him as "Captain of the Second Detachment of the Chahar East People's Self-Defense Army" and "League Leader of Xilin Gol League," organizing armed rebellion and assassinating Bao Yukun, Chairman of the Inner Mongolia Federation. This spring, they attacked the Xilin Chahar administrative organs, killing many cadres and civilians. The people of Inner Mongolia are extremely resentful.

　　蒙奸仁亲道尔吉武装叛乱
  　内蒙自治军将其击溃
    【新华社东北十三日电】（迟到）内蒙自治政府六月中旬讨伐布利亚特（位于锡林郭勒盟东南）蒙奸仁亲道尔吉匪部，将该部完全击溃，俘获一部，仁匪逃往多伦，自治政府已下令通缉归案法办。按：仁亲道尔吉系布和利亚特部贵族，帝俄时代曾在彼得堡骑兵学校受训，一九一八年率白流窜呼伦贝尔一带，后又窜至树林郭勒盟，七七事变后与日寇勾结，将其儿女媳妇送日本留学，以示亲善。当时内蒙抗日青年，多遭仁逆杀戳。“八·一五”后，国民党将其编为“察东民众自卫军第二队队长及“锡林郭勒盟盟长”，组织武装叛乱，暗杀内蒙联合会主委包玉昆等。今春袭锡察行政机关，杀害干部及民众多人，内蒙人民无不痛恨异常。
