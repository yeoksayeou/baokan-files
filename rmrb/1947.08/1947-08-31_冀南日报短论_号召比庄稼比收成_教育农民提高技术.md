　　Jinnan Daily Short Commentary
  　Calling for Competition in Crops and Harvests
  　Educating Peasants to Improve Technology
    [This newspaper's Jinnan dispatch, 29th] The autumn harvest is the season for summarizing the year's production. The Jinnan Daily recently published a short commentary calling on the entire region to launch a comparison movement of crops, harvests, and technologies. From the comparison, identify the reasons, and launch a mass summary, so that the masses can educate themselves. The commentary pointed out that it is necessary to compare planting versus not planting in time, irrigating seedlings versus not irrigating, mutual aid versus non-mutual aid, pest control versus non-pest control, multiple hoeings versus fewer hoeings, the depth of plowing, and the amount of fertilizer applied, etc., to summarize the achievements, and use vivid examples to publicize to the masses and strive to expand the wheat planting area.

　　冀南日报短论
  　号召比庄稼比收成
  　教育农民提高技术
    【本报冀南二十九日电】秋收正是总结全年生产的季节，此间冀南日报，顷以短论号召全区开展比庄稼、比收成、比技术的对比运动。从对比中找出原因，掀起群众性的总结，以群众自己教育自己，指出要比种与不抢种、浇苗与不浇苗、互助与不互助、除害与不除害、多锄与少锄、耕地之深浅、施肥之大小等内容，总结去成绩，以活的事例向群众宣传，争取扩大种麦面积。
