People Capture Prisoners
Three Short Stories

(I) When our army recovered Yuncheng, a stray soldier of the Chiang army fled to the home of Li Zeke, a blind man in Huangdui Temple in the third district, to ask for directions. The blind man heard his accent and knew he was not a local, and knowing that Yuncheng had been taken, he suspected he was a stray soldier of the Chiang army. So he pretended to be deaf and said to the enemy, "I can't hear you. What are you saying? Say it close to my ear!" The Chiang soldier walked up to him, and he suddenly grabbed him tightly and shouted, "Come quickly, I've caught an old Chiang!" The neighbors heard and ran over immediately, tied up the Chiang soldier, and sent him to the district.

(II) Liu Shanxiu, a farmer from Hecang Village in the third district of Yuncheng, was watching melons in the field when a fleeing "Homecoming Corps" member came and forced Liu Shanxiu at gunpoint to hide him. Shanxiu came up with a clever plan, exchanged clothes with him, told him to dress up as a melon watcher, and told him, "There are Eighth Route Army soldiers everywhere in the sorghum fields. You pretend to be a melon watcher, quickly give me the gun so I can hide it!" The "Homecoming Corps" member was panic-stricken and believed him, so he handed over the gun. After he got the gun, he said, "You've eaten a lot of my melons, I should invite you to the district for a rest!" The "Homecoming Corps" member became a prisoner in this way.

(III) A farmer from Yao Village in the fifth district of Yuncheng was hiding in a melon field watching melons when he saw a stray soldier of the Chiang army secretly picking melons. He picked up a wooden stick and chased after him: "You son of a bitch, you still dare to bully us!" Saying that, he struck with the stick and captured the Chiang soldier.

    群众抓俘虏
    小故事三则
    （一）我军收复郓城时，蒋军一散兵潜逃至三区黄堆寺瞎子李则科家问路，瞎子听他的口音不是本地人，又知道郓城打开了，心里怀疑是蒋军散兵，就故装耳聋对敌人说：“我听不见，你说的啥，你靠在我耳朵上说吧！”这个蒋军就走到他跟前，他一下子使劲抱住大叫道：“快来啊，我捉住一个老蒋了！”邻居听见连忙跑来，就把蒋军捆起来送到区里。
    （二）郓城三区何仓村农民刘善修，正在地里看瓜，一个逃散的“还乡团”走来，用枪强迫刘善修把他隐蔽起来，善修心生巧计，给他换了衣服，叫他打扮成看瓜的，又告诉他说：“高粱地都有八路，你装看瓜的快把枪给我，好藏起来！”该“还乡团”惊惶失措，信以为真，就将枪缴给他，他拿到枪后，就说：“你们吃我的瓜不少了，我该叫你到区里休息休息！”该“还乡团”就这样当了俘虏。
    （三）郓城五区姚庄一农民隐蔽在瓜地里看瓜，见蒋军一散兵偷偷来摘瓜，他拿起木棍追上去：“狗日的，还敢欺负咱！”说着就是一棍，把那蒋军捉住了。
