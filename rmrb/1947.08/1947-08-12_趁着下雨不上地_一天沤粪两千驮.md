　　Taking Advantage of the Rain to Stay Off the Fields
    Two Thousand Loads of Manure Composted in a Day
    [Our Dispatch] Dongbaiyu Village, Fourth District, Licheng, was unable to work in the fields due to the rain. The village's heroic cadres, mutual aid team leaders, and group leaders formulated a ten-day production plan. The entire village had seventy full laborers, eleven half-laborers, and sixty-four women. There were a total of one hundred and thirty mu of late millet, which needed to be hoed once, and two hundred and eight mu and nine fen of corn, all of which needed to be hoed once and top-dressed with fertilizer once. The cotton needed to be hoed three times and have the pests removed. When the rain stopped but the seedlings couldn't be hoed immediately, all the village laborers were organized to compost manure, using up all the wheat chaff in the village. In one day, they composted two thousand and seventy loads of manure, laying a foundation for large-scale wheat planting after the autumn harvest. Currently, the entire village has hoed forty-three mu of millet, top-dressed forty mu of corn with fertilizer, and women have tended seventy-two mu of cotton.
