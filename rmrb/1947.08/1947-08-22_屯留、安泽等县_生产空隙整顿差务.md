　　Tunliu, Anze and other counties
  　Rectifying corvée during production breaks
    [This report from Taiyue, August 21st] Tunliu, Anze, Fushan, and Linfen counties, during this break between production and participation in the war, are actively rectifying corvée duties to ensure that production and participation in the war are not hindered. Among them, Xu Ge Village in Fushan County is the most thorough, mainly using Shi Zhenming's "three-ticket system" for sorting. Those who exceeded the average amount of corvée were issued corvée tickets, and those who did not meet the average were issued work tickets. The masses exchanged them clearly, and the problem was solved, which was very satisfactory. Yuebi Village in Linfen County also gained the following experience in rectifying corvée: (1) Rectifying corvée must follow the route of relying on the poor and hired peasants, boldly mobilizing the masses. It should be recognized that opposing unfair corvée is a process of mass struggle, which cannot be solved by simply improving relations through administrative orders; (2) Implement a major liquidation of corvée, eliminate the blind spots for those who evade corvée, and publish the lists on time; (3) Combine rewards and punishments to eliminate the phenomenon of evading corvée; (4) When convening mass meetings to rectify corvée, free combination and small group discussions should be adopted, and the opinions of poor and hired peasants should be used as the main basis for handling corvée issues. Luo Village and other five villages in Tunliu County eliminated the unfair phenomena of the past. For example, Chen Zengze, a liberated peasant in Miaohou, had to perform corvée three times in a row, for a total of twenty-seven days. The mutual aid team in his family had to repay labor points even after they planted his land; Gao Bingyu, on the other hand, never performed corvée once and even earned seven dou and seven sheng of rice by participating in the mutual aid team. After the rectification, the scope of corvée was adjusted, accounts were settled regularly, and published on time. Those who performed corvée for more than four days were given an additional two points per labor day, and those who performed corvée for less than four days were given one labor day per corvée duty. Livestock were divided into three grades, with the first grade corvée being one day equivalent to three labor days, the second grade equivalent to two and a half labor days, and the third grade equivalent to one and a half labor days. Anze County is accelerating the clearing of those who evade corvée.

　　屯留、安泽等县
  　生产空隙整顿差务
    【本报太岳二十一日电】屯留、安泽、浮山、临汾在这段生产与参战空隙中，纷纷进行整顿差务，解决生产与参战两不误问题。其中以浮山徐葛村最为彻底，主要是用了石振明“三票制度”整理，超过支差平均数者发给差票，不及平均数者发给工票，群众互相兑换清楚，问题得到解决，非常满意。临汾岳壁村在整顿差务中并取得了以下经验：（一）整顿差务必须走贫雇路线，大胆放手发动群众，应该认识反支差不公是一个群众斗争过程，决不是行政命令改善一下关系所能解决；（二）实行差务大清算，肃清斗争对象逃避差务的死角，按时公布清单；（三）奖励与处罚相结合，消灭逃差现象；（四）召开群众整差会议，应采用自由结合小组讨论的办法，领导上应以贫雇农意见作为处理差务问题的主要根据。屯留罗村等五个村肃清了过去不公现象。如庙后翻身户陈增则一连支差三次，共二十七天，家里的地互助组给种上还要还工；高秉玉却一次也没有支，还参加互助组赚米七斗七升。清理后，并调整支差面，经常算帐，按期公布，支差在四天以上者，每工加二分，四天以下者一差顶一工，牲口分三等，一等差支一天顶三工，二等顶二个半工，三等顶一个半工。安泽正加速清理斗争对象逃避差务者。
