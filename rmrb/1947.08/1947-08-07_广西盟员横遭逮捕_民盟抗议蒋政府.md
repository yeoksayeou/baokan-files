Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 5th: United Press International, Shanghai, 4th: A spokesman for the Democratic League stated that over a hundred members of the Democratic League were arrested in Guangxi. The Democratic League has lodged a serious protest with the Chiang government, demanding their immediate release. Another report: Chiang Kai-shek's propaganda machine has recently repeatedly slandered the Democratic League as "the Communist Party's tail," and its sinister intentions are actually to use this as an excuse to arrest members of the League throughout the country.
