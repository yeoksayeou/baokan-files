Experiences in Rooting Guerrilla Warfare Behind Enemy Lines
	Tài Háng Wěi Wěi Huì
In the past six months, the development of guerrilla warfare behind enemy lines in the Taihang area has gone through the following three stages: From the second half of October to November last year, the enemy and puppets launched a large-scale offensive. The cadres and militia who withdrew turned to the enemy's rear under the slogan of "fight out to avenge and eliminate hatred"; In January and February of this year, amid the turbulent environment behind enemy lines, the cadres and militia were determined to gain a foothold and persist behind enemy lines through the widespread movement of performing meritorious service for the people, quickly opening up the situation behind enemy lines, turning to the initiative, frustrating the enemy and puppets, and inspiring the masses; After March, from our cadres and militia taking the lead in combat alone, to the widespread development of struggles by the masses behind enemy lines against counter-settlements, against apportionments, against grain robbery, against conscription, as well as eliminating traitors, preventing bandits, and protecting their homes and defending themselves, and joint defense among villages. In many places, the masses themselves organized armed self-defense forces, took up various indigenous weapons and persisted in the struggle. In Xiaowangzhuang, Bo'ai, even wives and children were organized to stand guard and patrol; In Xiguanzhuang, five livestock were taken away by the enemy in one night, and the masses shouted and chased after them as soon as they left the village; The masses in Xiqiu Village also rushed to support upon hearing the news, scaring the enemy bandits to abandon the livestock and flee. At this point, in the struggle behind enemy lines, an extremely important problem has been solved, that is, in the heartland of the enemy, we can not only "fight back" in arms, but also gain a foothold and persist, so that the flames of guerrilla warfare are ignited everywhere and take root among the masses!
The results of the development and rooting of guerrilla warfare behind enemy lines in the past six months have brought us unprecedented and tremendous victories. In the war, many heroes who killed the enemy and model armed work teams emerged. Such as Guo Xing from Huixian County and Li Jiacheng's armed work team from Qinyang, who adhered to the banner of political power and carried out political offensives; Duan Fazhang and Ren Wenliang's armed work team from Anyang, who suppressed traitors and bullies and combined political offensives to carry out counter-settlements; Lian Zhizhong from Xiuwu, Yang Juhe, Ren Xiuhe from Jiaozuo, and Zhou Jiating's armed work team from Pingding, who were brave and good at fighting and repeatedly defeated the enemy and puppets; Cheng Quanfu from Tangyin and Jia Maohou's armed work team from Taigu, who attacked, killed and captured traitors and bullies and eliminated harm for the people. The mass heroes who killed the enemy included Han Erhua, the female reconnaissance hero, who bravely and ingeniously disguised herself three times to enter and exit the enemy's strongholds; Hu Degui, the capture hero "Flying Tiger on the Roof," who captured seventy-eight landlords from the returning home corps in four months and killed two; and Mu Xicheng, the explosion hero, who organized and led the masses of the whole village to carry out explosions, once exploding eighty-two stone mines and landmines, instantly killing or wounding eighty-eight enemies. These model armed work teams and heroes who killed the enemy have become clear banners for persisting in guerrilla warfare behind enemy lines.
The results of the development and rooting of guerrilla warfare behind enemy lines in the past six months have made us clearly see that the picture of guerrilla warfare behind enemy lines is: Under the unified leadership, the militia and armed work teams, combined with the local armed forces, under the principle of "the enemy advances, we advance; the enemy does not advance, we also advance," attack the enemy in large groups, annihilate the enemy in small groups, and shrink the enemy's main force and large groups within points and lines, so that the enemy's local teams and small groups dare not disperse their activities, and we completely grasp the initiative, control the vast rural areas behind enemy lines, and turn the rural areas behind enemy lines into the world of the broad masses of peasants. How to achieve this picture of struggle behind enemy lines? According to the experience of various places, there are several important issues:

(1) The movement of the masses behind enemy lines to avenge their hatred, suppress traitors and bullies, counter-settle accounts, and demand land is completely inseparable from the development of widespread guerrilla warfare. The nature of guerrilla warfare behind enemy lines is the nature of a class war for land reform. The main targets of struggle for the militia and armed work teams must be all stubborn special agents, counter-settlement leaders, returning home corps, Lian Zhuang Hui... and other feudal landlord armed forces. The method of struggle must be a peasant armed liberation movement of "holding a gun in one hand and dividing the land in the other." Cadres, militia, and armed work teams must be armed liberation teams that both fight and mobilize the masses. Without the revenge and liberation movement of the masses behind enemy lines, guerrilla warfare will lose its meaning and the foundation for persisting and taking root. It will become impossible to truly control the rural areas and turn the enemy's rear into the world of the broad masses of peasants. Without the widespread and vigorous development of guerrilla warfare, it will also be difficult for the masses behind enemy lines to carry out revenge and liberation movements. Experience has proven that wherever this basic principle is correctly applied, the mass guerrilla war will quickly develop and take root.

(2) Tightly combine military battles with political battles. The victory in military struggle must be combined with the victory in political struggle. The fact that the masses behind enemy lines, under the deception and intimidation of the enemy and puppets, have gone from daring not to see us to daring to see us, and that the enemy and puppet internal panic and turbulence, a large number of puppet soldiers and fleeing households have escaped and surrendered to the liberated areas, are all the result of our political offensive victories. The political offensive must start from the struggle, and the masses' struggle must be affirmed and let go. It is necessary to clearly establish the banner of democratic political power, resolutely take charge and be the master of the house. The political offensive against landlords, traitors, and bullies must be tenacious and continuous. The slogans put forward must be specific and clear, aimed at specific people and events, and hit the nail on the head, so that they are "burned in oil" and restless; But the tactics must be flexible. In addition to resolutely cracking down on stubborn and unrepentant landlords, those who have wavered and withdrawn their ill-gotten gains should be won over or encouraged separately. For areas we cannot reach, we use mass letters to propose: "Withdraw your ill-gotten gains and hand over your guns to settle the matter, you won't get anywhere by not bowing your head." Taigu proposed that the militia and armed work teams should: "Fight when there is an enemy, and propagandize when there is no enemy," which is the best way to closely combine military battles with political battles.

(3) Everything must proceed from the mass line of mobilizing the masses for self-defense struggles. To strike the enemy accurately and painfully, Huixian proposed "the enemy does what, we fight what," which is the best way to closely protect the interests of the masses. For the mass armed forces organized behind enemy lines, except for those controlled by landlord secret agents or formally organized, the guns should be resolutely confiscated, disbanded, or thoroughly reformed. The basic mass armed forces genuinely produced in the mass struggle should be boldly and resolutely cultivated for their ability to conduct self-defense struggles; all blind suspicion, not daring to approach, not daring to let go of the struggle, and the phenomenon of generally dissolving them when problems arise is a phenomenon of not following the mass line. For the genuine mass armed forces in the local area, the main focus should be on mobilizing the masses themselves to rise up, conduct self-defense struggles, and persist in local guerrilla warfare. Any phenomenon of transferring them away or making them guerrilla teams will deviate from the masses' demand for self-defense and will lead to the cancellation or weakening of the widespread development of mass guerrilla warfare behind enemy lines.

(4) In the operations of the militia and armed work teams against the enemy's local teams and feudal armed forces, the general skills of sniping, explosions, capture, night raids, and joint defense operations have been greatly improved in terms of proficiency and accuracy compared to the past; But more importantly, there are the following tactical innovations and developments:

"Aim accurately and defeat one point, break through a whole area." We concentrate our superior forces, using the method of "fighting one police station and alarming ten," and resolutely and cleanly defeat the worst and most powerful armed force of the enemy first. The general ones around will quickly waver and scatter, and under our tracking and pursuit, it will be like splitting bamboo.

The mighty "Full Sky of Stars" tactic. Under the general shock of key breakthroughs, we immediately adopt decentralized small armed forces, spread out across the surface, and combine with the masses' open and secret cooperation to carry out a small armed search and capture campaign to annihilate the enemy everywhere, often quickly achieving victory in clearing the remnants of the feudal armed forces.

Long-range surprise capture (some call it the "Black Tiger Digs Heart Battle"). The enemy's local teams, feudal local armed forces, township and district offices, etc., generally have the characteristics of poor tactics, fear of death, and mass hatred; We adopt the method of sudden encirclement and annihilation from a long distance, which is very easy to win. The decisive factors for this guaranteed victory lie in the four links of "concentrating superior forces, accurate intelligence, rapid action, and the perseverance of resolute combat."

(5) The wartime life and order in which the masses behind enemy lines organize self-defense and autonomous struggle in the armed liberation struggle, such as emptying the houses, temporary transfer, intelligence sentry posts, patrols, joint defense, etc., are also important for persisting in long-term struggle and consolidating rural bases.

(6) The determination of cadres to gain a foothold and persist behind enemy lines, the leading role of leading cadres in setting an example, the development of the movement to perform meritorious service for the people, and the strengthening of unified leadership are often decisive links, especially in the initial stage of opening up the situation and persisting in the struggle in serious situations.

　　敌后游击战争生根经验
    太行武委会
    半年来太行敌后游击战争的开展，经过以下的三个阶段：去年十月下半月至十一月，敌伪大举进攻，我撤出的干部民兵在“打出去报仇雪恨”口号下，转向敌后进军；今年一二月在敌后环境动荡下，由往返辗转（道清路南曾五进五出）到普遍为民立功运动开展，干部民兵决心在敌后立脚坚持，使敌后局面很快打开，转向主动，挫败敌伪，振奋群众；三月以后，由我干部民兵单独带头作战，到敌后群众普遍开展反倒算、反摊派、反抢粮、抓丁，以及除奸防匪保家自卫，村村联防的斗争。好多地方的群众自己组织了武装自卫队，拿起各种土武器坚持斗争，博爱小王庄把老婆小孩都组织起来站岗放哨；西关庄一夜被敌拉走五个牲口，才出村群众大喊直追；西邱村群众也闻声赶来支援，吓得敌匪丢弃牲口而逃。至此，在敌后斗争中，便解决了一个极其重大的问题，即是在敌人的腹心区，我们不但能武装“打回去”，而且还能够立脚坚持，使游击战争的烽火到处点燃，并在群众中生了根！
    半年来敌后游击战争开展生根的结果，使我们获得空前巨大的胜利。在战争中出现了不少杀敌英雄、模范武工队。如坚持政权旗帜、开展政攻的辉县郭兴，沁阳李家成武工队；镇压奸霸，结合政攻开展反倒算的安阳段法章、任文亮武工队；英勇善战，屡败敌伪的修武连致中，焦作杨聚和、任秀河，平定周家庭武工队；袭杀捕捉奸霸，为民除害的汤阴程全福，太谷贾毛猴武工队。群众杀敌英雄则如侦察女英雄韩二花，勇敢机智三次化装进出敌人据点：捕捉英雄“房上飞虎”胡德贵，四个月捕捉还乡团地主七十八名，并打死二名；爆炸英雄穆喜成组织领导全村群众爆炸，一次爆炸石雷地雷八十二个，即死伤敌八十八名。这些模范的武工队和杀敌英雄，都成为坚持敌后游击战争的鲜明旗帜。
    半年敌后游击战争开展生根的结果，使我们清楚看到敌后游击战争的景象则是：在一元化领导下，民兵武工队结合地方武装，在敌进我进，敌不进我也进的方针下，袭敌大股，歼敌小股，把敌主力和大股围缩在点线内，使敌地方团队和小股不敢分散活动，我完全掌握主动，控制敌后广大农村阵地，变敌后农村为广大农民群众的天下。怎样达成这个敌后斗争的图景？从各地经验来看有以下几个重要问题：
    （一）敌后群众报仇雪恨，镇压奸霸，反倒算，要土地的运动与广泛游击战争的开展，完全是不可分，敌后游击战争的性质即为土地改革的阶级战争的性质，民兵武工队的主要斗争对象，必须针对一切顽固地特，倒算头子、还乡团、联庄会……等封建地主武装，斗争方法必须是“一手拿枪，一手分田”的农民武装翻身运动。干部民兵武工队必须是既打仗，又发动群众的武装翻身队。没有敌后群众的复仇翻身运动，游击战争便会失去意义与生根坚持的基础。真正控制农村阵地，变敌后为广大农民的天下便成为不可能。没有游击战争的广泛有力的开展，敌后群众复仇翻身运动也很困难。经验证明：那里正确运用了这个基本方针，那里群众游击战争便会迅速开展并生了根。
    （二）把打军事仗与政治仗紧密结合起来，军事斗争胜利必须结合政治斗争的胜利。敌后群众在敌伪欺骗威吓下，由不敢见我到敢见我，使敌伪内部恐慌动荡，大批伪军士兵和逃亡户逃散和投到解放区来，都是我政攻获胜的结果。政攻又必须从斗争出发，对群众斗争要放手肯定，要明确树立民主政权旗帜，坚决掌腰作主，对地主奸霸的政攻，要顽强连续，提出口号要具体明确，对准具体人、事、要击中要害，使其“滚油浇心”，坐卧不安；但策略要灵活，除坚决打击顽固不化地主外，对已动摇退出果实的，则分别争取或鼓励，对我不能达到的地区，则用群众传封信，提出：“退出果实缴枪了事，不低头到那里也不行。”太谷提出民兵武工队要作到：“有敌就打仗，没敌就宣传”，是使打军事仗与政治仗紧密结合的最好办法。
    （三）必须一切从发动群众性的保家自卫斗争的群众路线出发。对敌人要打的准打的痛，辉县提出“敌人搞啥我打啥”，是密切保卫群众利益的最好办法。对敌后组成的群众武装，除被地主特务掌握或形式编制起来的，应坚决收枪解散或进行彻底改造外，真正群众斗争中产生的基本群众武装，应大胆放手的培养其保家自卫斗争能力；一切盲目怀疑，不敢接近、不敢放手斗争，一有问题便一般化下了解散的现象，即非群众路线的现象，对本地的真正的群众武装应以发动群众自己起来，进行保家自卫斗争，坚持当地游击战争为主。一切远调拉走或使其游击队化的现象，都会脱离群众保家自卫要求，而将造成取消或消弱敌后群众性游击战争的广泛开展。
    （四）民兵武工队在对敌地方团队，封建武装的作战中，一般冷枪、爆炸、捕捉、夜摸、联防作战……等，都比过去有了很大熟练、准确的提高；但更重要的是有着如下几个战术的创造与发挥：
    “瞅准打垮一点，突开一片”，我集中优势力量，以“打一警十”的办法，坚决干净先打垮敌最坏的力量较大的武装，周围一般的便会很快动摇、吓散，在我跟踪击追下，将势如破竹。
    声势浩大的“满天星”战术，在重点突破普遍震荡之下，我即采取分散的小型武装，面的撒开，结合群众公开秘密配合，到处开展小型武装的搜索捕捉歼敌运动，常会很快获得扫清封建武装残余的胜利。
    远距离的奇袭捕捉（有的叫“黑虎掏心战”。敌人的地方团队封建地方武装、乡区公所等，普遍存在着战术差、怕死、群众痛恨的特点；我则采取远距离的突然包围一鼓歼灭的办法，是很易获胜的，而这个有把握胜利的决定因素，即在于“集中优势兵力，准确情报，迅速动作，果敢作战的毅力”等四个环节。
    （五）敌后群众在武装翻身斗争中，组织保家自卫，自主斗争的战时生活与秩序，如空室清野，临时转移、情报岗哨、巡夜、联防……等，对坚持长期斗争，巩固农村阵地也很重要。
    （六）干部在敌后立脚坚持决心，领导干部以身作则的带头作用，开展为民立功运动与强化一元化的领导等，特别在开始打开局面和坚持严重情况下斗争中，常为决定的环节。
