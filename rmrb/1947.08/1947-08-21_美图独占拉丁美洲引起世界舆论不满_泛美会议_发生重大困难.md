Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 18th. The United States' policy of turning Latin America into its exclusive dependency has aroused dissatisfaction and criticism in world opinion. Reuters correspondent Gamble lamented in a report on British-South American economic relations on the 14th: "Britain's exports to Latin America in three months are only equal to the United States' exports there in one week; but Britain is far more dependent on exports than the United States." Soviet journalist Zhukov wrote in Pravda commenting on the ongoing Pan-American Conference: "The Marshall Plan is closely related to the work in Rio de Janeiro, it is merely a few links in the chains used by those who advocate that the United States has 'permanent world leadership' or the right to rule the world to bind the world." Zhukov pointed out: After making Latin America economically dependent on the United States, it is now determined to make them militarily completely subordinate to the United States, thereby further depriving them of their sovereignty. But American diplomats should not expect to succeed easily; for example, Argentina, which is more economically dependent on Britain, has repeatedly attempted to escape American influence. Zhukov concluded: "The fate of Latin American countries is instructive. Those in Europe who talk about compromise with the United States and limiting national sovereignty should think twice about this."

Former US Vice President Wallace also wrote in "The New Republic" magazine opposing the Truman administration's plan to achieve "standardization of armaments in the Western Hemisphere." Wallace asked: "Isn't Pan-Americanism now becoming a military adventure running blindly after the United States?" Wallace condemned the United States' attempt to militarize Latin America by supplying weapons, strengthen anti-democratic regimes, and ensure American leadership. Wallace pointed out that, with the exception of those interested in dictatorship, no Latin American country can agree with the Truman Doctrine and be a military tail of the United States.

Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 18th. Rio de Janeiro dispatch: The "Pan-American Conference" opened at 4 p.m. on the 15th in a large hostel in Petropolis, forty miles north of Ba Jing. After Brazilian President Dutra delivered the opening speech, the conference elected Brazilian Foreign Minister Fernandes as chairman. The conference encountered major difficulties in deciding how to adopt "joint defense actions." Argentina advocated that action should be taken only after approval by all countries, while some countries led by the United States advocated that only a two-thirds majority should be required. Marshall held secret meetings with the foreign ministers of Brazil and Argentina on the 14th to discuss this issue, but no agreement was reached. A fierce debate will occur on this at the conference.

### 美图独占拉丁美洲引起世界舆论不满　“泛美会议”发生重大困难

　　美图独占拉丁美洲引起世界舆论不满
  　“泛美会议”发生重大困难
    【新华社陕北十八日电】美国对拉丁美洲的独占附属国化政策，引起世界舆论的不满和抨击。路透社记者甘倍尔十四日在报导英国和南美的经济关系时感叹地说：“英国对拉丁美洲三个月的输出，只等于美国对那里一周的输出；但英国却远较美国依赖于输出”。苏名记者朱可夫在真理报上著文评论举行中的泛美会议称：“马歇尔计划与里约热内卢的工作有密切的联系，它只是主张美国负有‘世界永久领导权’或美国有权统治全世界的那些人用以束缚世界之锁链上的几个环节而已。”朱氏指出：美国在拉丁美洲经济依赖于美国之后，现又决定使它们在军事上完全附属于美国，从而进一步剥夺它们的主权。但美国外交家休想轻而易举的成功；例如经济上更依赖于英国的阿根廷，即一再企图逃出美国影响。朱氏结语称：“拉丁美洲国家的命运是富有教训意义的。那些在欧洲高谈与美国妥协与限制国家主权的人们，应当对此三思而行。”
    美前副总统华莱士也在“新共和”杂志上著文反对杜鲁门政府实现“西半球军备标准化”的计划。华氏问道：“泛美主义现在不正在变成跟美国瞎跑的军事冒险了吗？”华氏谴责美国企图以供给武器来使拉丁美洲军国主义化、加强反民主政权、并保证美国的领导权。华氏指出：拉丁美洲各国除对独裁有兴趣者外，没有一个国家能同意杜鲁门主义，做美国的军事尾巴。
    【新华社陕北十八日电】里约热内卢讯，“泛美会议”十五日下午四时在巴京以北四十里之彼特罗波斯一大旅舍中开幕，巴西总统杜特拉致开幕词后，会议即选举巴外长费兰第斯为主席，会议对如何决定采取“共同防卫行动”一点，发生重大困难。阿根廷主张须经全体国家通过始采取行动，以美国为首之若干国家主张仅需三分之二多数通过。马歇尔十四日曾与巴西及阿根廷外长举行秘密会议讨论此问题，但未获任何协议。大会对此将发生剧烈辩论。
