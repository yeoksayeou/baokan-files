Relying on Rain Leads to a Million Jin Less Harvest
　　Pingxiang Waters Seedlings More Urgently Than Managing Crops
　　[Our Jinnan Dispatch, 27th] Early watering, more grain; late watering means relying on the heavens and being fooled. This is the valuable lesson learned by cadres and the masses of villages along the Yang River in Pingxiang through the "comparing crops" and "finding reasons" movement. Villages along the river all relied on river water to irrigate their seedlings. After the seedlings emerged, some actively watered them upon seeing the dry weather, while others relied on the heavens and waited for rain, waiting until the sixth lunar month without any rain. Those who didn't water also stubbornly stuck to past experiences, fearing that watering the seedlings would be a waste of effort, saying that even if the water came, they couldn't escape being flooded, and never watered them. As a result, the early-watered sorghum is more than a foot taller than a person's head and is already ripe; the unwatered sorghum is only a little more than half a person's height, withered and dying. Recently, villages along the river conducted the "comparing crops" and "finding reasons" movement, seeking why the crops grew well in some places and poorly in others, and learned a great lesson. Thirty mu of autumn seedlings belonging to Su Lin and three others in Yin Village were watered after the wheat harvest in April. Now, the sorghum can be eaten, with a yield of 130 jin per mu. One hundred and thirty-five qing of land in ten villages, including East and West Yin Village, Nan Zhou East, Zhong Yi Abandoned, and Taiping Village, were all watered in early June, with a yield of at most 100 jin per mu, 30 jin less per mu, totaling 405,000 jin less. Sixty-four qing in eight villages, including Yin Village, were not watered at all, with a yield of at most 50 jin per mu, 80 jin less per mu than the early-watered ones, totaling 2,640,000 jin less. After such comparative education, those who watered late and those who didn't water are all anxious, saying that they were fooled by relying on the heavens and waiting for rain, and also saying: "If watered early, the sorghum ears will develop early, grow fast, and not be afraid even if the water comes." Therefore, they are now opening the gates to water the late seedlings.

### 等雨靠天少收百万斤　平乡比庄稼加紧浇苗

　　等雨靠天少收百万斤
  　平乡比庄稼加紧浇苗
    【本报冀南廿七日电】早浇苗，多收粮，晚浇靠天上了当。这是平乡沿阳河村庄干部群众“比庄稼”“找原因”所得到的宝贵教训。沿河各村庄都是靠河水浇地种上的苗，苗生出后，有的见到天气亢旱，就积极浇，有的靠天等雨，直等到阴历六月初，还没等着雨。没浇的还有的固守过去经验，怕浇了苗白费劲，说水下来也脱不了淹，一直没有浇，结果早浇的高粱高过人顶尺多，已熟了；没浇的高粱，只多半人高，枯黄将死。最近沿河各村，干群进行‘比庄稼’”“找原因”运动，寻找庄稼为什么长的有好有坏，得到很大教训。尹村肃林等四人的三十亩秋苗，是四月麦后浇的，现在高粱吃到嘴里，每亩收成一百三十斤。尹村东西庄、南周东、忠义弃、太平庄等十个村，有一百三十五顷地，都是六月初浇的，每亩收成顶多百斤，每亩就少收三十斤，共少收四十万五千斤。尹村等八个村有六十四顷根本没浇，每亩生产顶多五十斤，比早浇者每亩少收八十斤，共少收粮二百六十四万斤。经过这样的对比教育，晚浇没浇的都急的脚，说是上了靠天等雨的当，并且说：“浇的早，高粱穗莠的早，长的快，水来了也不怕呀。”所以现在都开闸浇晚苗。
