　　Xie's Headquarters in Shanghai Issues Statement
  　Denouncing UNRRA for Succumbing to Bandit Chiang
    UNRRA Continues to Provide Relief to Chiang's Troops in Northeast and Other Areas
    Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 26th -- Shanghai News: Lin Zhong of Xie's Headquarters in Shanghai issued a written statement on the 24th, stating: If UNRRA cannot fairly distribute relief supplies to both the Communist and Kuomintang areas, then all UNRRA personnel and supplies must immediately withdraw from China. Lin condemned: The Liberated Areas have so far received less than two percent of the UNRRA supplies sent to China. Lin denounced UNRRA for completely succumbing to Chiang Kai-shek.
    Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 26th -- According to a Central News Agency report: UNRRA will continue to transport relief supplies to the Kuomintang areas in the Northeast. More than a dozen senior UNRRA personnel flew to Shenyang on the morning of the 24th aboard planes from Chennault's Air Transport Command to discuss the transport of relief supplies with relevant Kuomintang officials in the Northeast. UNRRA announced at the end of last month that it would suspend the transport of relief supplies north of 34 degrees north latitude from July 28th, and then reiterated that it would formally implement this decision from August 13th. To cover up its intention to strengthen aid to Chiang's civil war by stopping relief to the Liberated Areas, UNRRA falsely claimed that some Kuomintang areas north of 34 degrees north latitude would also be affected by the suspension of relief supplies. This lie has now been exposed. According to news leaked by the Chiang-controlled Ministry of National Defense's Military News Agency: UNRRA is even using its Chennault's Air Transport Command to transport supplies to support Yan's troops in Taiyuan for the Chiang government. The news stated: Guo Zonghan, Chief of Staff of Chiang's Taiyuan Pacification Headquarters, has signed a contract with Chennault's Air Transport Command, stipulating that 1,600 tons of supplies will be transported by air from Shanghai, Beiping and other places to Taiyuan within 45 days.

　　解总驻沪办事处发表声明
  　痛斥联总屈服于蒋贼
    联总继续接济东北等地蒋军
    【新华社陕北二十六日电】上海消息：解总驻沪办事处林仲于二十四日发表书面声明称：联总如不能公平分配救济物资于国共两区，则一切联总人员及物资只有立即退出中国。林氏谴责说：解放区至今仅收到联总输华物资的不及百分之二。林氏痛斥联总完全屈服于蒋介石。
    【新华社陕北二十六日电】据中央社消息透露：联总将继续对东北国民党地区救济物资之输送，联总高级人员十余人已于二十四日晨乘陈纳德空运大队飞机飞往沈阳，就救济物资运输事与东北国民党有关方面商谈。按联总由于上月底宣布自七月二十八日起停止北纬三十四度以北地区救济物资之运送，后又重申自八月十三日起正式实行此项决定，联总为掩饰其以停止对解放区救济加强援蒋内战之用心，曾诡称北纬三十四度以北某些国民党地区亦将受到停运救济物资之影响，此项谎言如今已不攻自破。另据蒋记国防部军闻社消息泄露：联总且正以其所属陈纳德空运大队为蒋政府运送物资接济太原阎军。该消息称：蒋记太原绥署参谋长郭宗汉已与陈纳德空运大队签订合同，规定此项空运物资为一千六百吨，于四十五日内由上海、北平等地运往太原。
