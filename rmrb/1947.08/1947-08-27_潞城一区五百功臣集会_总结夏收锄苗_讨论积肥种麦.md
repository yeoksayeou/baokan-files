　　Lucheng First District Gathers Five Hundred Meritorious Workers
  　Summarize Summer Harvest and Weeding, Discuss Manure Accumulation and Wheat Planting
    [This Newspaper reported] According to Comrade Chen Zhenhua, secretary of Lucheng County, the First District convened a meeting of over five hundred meritorious workers on the 16th of this month to summarize the summer harvest and weeding and to discuss manure accumulation and wheat planting. A total of 55 villages have weeded autumn crops three times, including 7,817 mu of millet, 19,043.5 mu of corn, 2,212.1 mu of cotton, and 325 mu of miscellaneous autumn crops, totaling 29,397.6 mu, accounting for 37.1% of the total autumn land. Topdressing fertilizer was applied to 4,473.5 mu, 21,419.8 mu of corn, 498 mu of cotton, and 325 mu of miscellaneous autumn crops, totaling 26,716.5 mu, accounting for 33.8% of the total autumn land. One thousand and nine mu of wasteland were eliminated, 536.8 mu of buckwheat were planted, 464.1 mu of vegetables were planted, and 256.5 mu were replanted. It is estimated that topdressing, replanting, and eliminating wasteland will increase production by 8,402 shi, 1 dou, and 2 sheng. Wheat land plowed twice amounted to 9,761 mu, accounting for 32.6% of the existing wheat land. Currently, 111,285 dan of manure and night soil have been accumulated, 26,578 carts of sheep manure, 154,104 carts of clod manure, 681,081 jin of artemisia stalks, 56,322 jin of hemp dregs, and 95,295 dan of miscellaneous fertilizer. The experience gained from the above achievements is: First, the leading role of cadres and meritorious workers. Zhang Qihong from Louhou Village said, "If cadres and meritorious workers don't take the lead, the masses will definitely drift along. Pang Shun from Dongguan called on everyone to plant double crops, but the masses were afraid that the land would be too dry. He then planted four mu of beans first. Three days later, the beans had sprouted. He then mobilized the masses to visit the field. Everyone believed that the crops could grow, and under this influence, dozens of mu were planted with double crops." He said, "Simply calling on people is not enough; you must personally take the lead and let the masses see the facts in order to get through to their thinking." Li Changhong from Tai Dong said, "When applying topdressing fertilizer, the masses thought that the land had already been harrowed and that topdressing would not be effective. I then fertilized the corn first. The fertilized crops turned from yellow to black. The masses all said that fertilizing now is also effective, so all three qing and eighty mu of corn in the village were fertilized." Second, accurate calculation and specific division of labor. In each stage of work, each village detailedly based their plans on the village's crops, labor force, and livestock, how much labor was needed, and then, under the slogan of "No one is idle, everyone makes the best use of their talents," organized a specific division of labor. For example, Pang Tingshun's group in Dongguan finished harvesting more than one qing of land in three days during the wheat harvest. Because women had the habit of accumulating wheat stalks to prepare raw materials for straw braids and were unwilling to harvest wheat in the field, preferring to sort the wheat stalks at home, he organized the women in the field and at home to exchange work points, with those in the field receiving one more work point than those at home. This ensured both the harvesting of wheat and the accumulation of wheat stalks. Third, mutual inspection. All villages universally conducted challenges and inspections on schedule, not only checking the completion of the quantity but also checking the quality of the work. This played a significant role in boosting morale and promoting work. However, in the inspection, due to unclear conditions in the original challenge letters and some views of trophyism, some contradictions occurred between villages during the summary. Based on this experience, everyone discussed that the challenge was to promote work. In order to overcome the above shortcomings, the unanimous opinion is that in the future, each village should formulate detailed plans and submit them to the district government, which will organize unified inspections on schedule, thus forming a district-wide competition. Fourth, seize typical examples, commend models, and motivate everyone. In the process of each work, a typical fact was discovered and praised on the radio, such as when Zhaidian was applying topdressing fertilizer, they seized the typical fact of Zhao Xiaowu's group, and after being praised on the radio, it promoted the entire village. Finally, in discussing future work, everyone unanimously responded to the call of the county party committee to accumulate a large amount of fertilizer, eliminate wasteland, expand wheat fields, and increase wheat harvest. There are now 29,949 mu of wheat fields, accounting for 27.5% of the total land area. According to preliminary plans, it is planned to expand wheat fields by 11,744.2 mu, accounting for 10.7% of the total land area. In total, wheat fields will be expanded to 38.2% of all land, striving to reach 40%. Everyone is carrying out this work under the slogan of "Adding merit upon merit."

　　潞城一区五百功臣集会
  　总结夏收锄苗　讨论积肥种麦
    【本报讯】据潞城县书陈振华同志报导：一区于本月十六日，召开五百余功臣会议，总结夏收锄苗，讨论积肥种麦。总计五十五个村，锄过三遍的秋苗有谷七千八百一十七亩，玉茭一万九千零四十三亩五分，棉花二千二百一十二亩一分，杂秋三百二十五亩，合计二万九千三百九十七亩六分，占总秋地的百分之三十七点一。上追肥四千四百七十三亩五分，玉茭二万一千四百一十九亩八分，棉花四百九十八亩，杂秋三百二十五亩，合计二万六千七百一十六亩五分，占总秋地百分之三十三点八。消灭荒地一千亩九分，种荞麦五百三十六亩八分，种菜四百六十四亩一分，补种二百五十六亩五分，上追肥、补种、消灭荒地三种，预计可增产八千四百零二石一斗二升。犁过二遍的麦地九千七百六十一亩，占现有麦地的百分之卅二点六，现在已积肥圊粪一十一万一千二百八十五担，羊粪二万六千五百七十八车，圪渣粪一十五万四千一百零四车，割蒿六十八万一千零八十一斤，麻参五万六千三百二十二斤，杂肥九万五千二百九十五担。获得以上成绩的经验是：一，干部功臣的带头作用，楼后村张其洪说：“干部功臣不带头，群众一定会自流。东关庞顺号召大家回茬，群众思想都怕地干不来，他便先种了四亩豆，三天后豆已发芽，他便发动群众到地参观，大家都相信能够出来，这样影响下，回茬了数十亩”。他说：“只号召不顶事，非亲自带头叫群众看到事实才能打通思想”。台东李长红说：“在上追肥时，群众思想上认为地已耧过，上追肥已不顶事了，我便先奶玉茭，奶过的庄稼由黄变成黑，群众都说现在奶亦顶事，这样全村三顷八十亩玉茭全部奶完。”二、精确计算，具体分工。在每一段工作中，各村都详细的根据各村的作物、劳畜力，用工多少，然后再不闲一个人，人尽其才，才尽其用的口号下，组织具体分工，如东关庞廷顺组，在麦收时一顷多地三天割完，因妇女有积麦秆准备草帽辫原料的习惯，不愿到地割麦，愿意在家整理麦秆，他便组织到地与在家的女人变工分红，到地比在家多分一分，这样作到了割麦与积麦秆两不。三、互相检查。各村都普遍的进行了挑战，按期检查，不仅检查数量的完成，而且检查质量的好坏，这对情绪的鼓舞及工作的推动起了很大的作用。但在检查中，由于挑战书原来的条件不明确，以及某些锦标主义的观点，在总结时发生村与村的一些矛盾，根据这个经验，大家讨论了挑战是为了推动工作。为了克服以上的毛病，一致的意见是，今后各村规定详细的计划，送交区署，由区按期组织统一检查，这样形成全区的大竞赛。四、抓住典型，表扬模范，推动大家。在每一个工作进行中，都是发现了一个典型的事实，即在广播台上表扬，如翟店在上追肥时，抓住赵小五组的典型事实，经广播台表扬后，推动了全村。最后在讨论今后工作中，一致响应县委的号召，大量积肥，消灭荒地，扩大麦田，增加麦收。现在有麦田二万九千九百四十九亩，占总地面积百分之二十七点五，经初步计划，准备扩大麦田一万一千七百四十四亩二分，占总地面积百分之十点七。总计麦田扩大到所有土地的百分之三十八点二，争取达到百分之四十。大家在功上加功的口号下，来进行这段工作。
