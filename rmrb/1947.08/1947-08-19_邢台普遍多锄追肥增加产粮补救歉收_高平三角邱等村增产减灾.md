　　Xingtai Universally Uses More Weeding and Topdressing to Increase Grain Production and Remedy Poor Harvests
  　Gaoping Sanjiaqiu and Other Villages Increase Production and Reduce Disasters
    [Our Correspondent Team, 17th Dispatch] In the old liberated area of Xingtai, the people are striving to increase grain production by weeding the seedlings more often to compensate for losses caused by the disaster. In Li San Kui's team in Wang Village, they are determined to weed four times. Currently, in addition to the 24 mu of late seedlings that have been weeded four times, the team has another 11 mu that should be weeded twice and 22 mu that should be weeded three times, all of which will be weeded four times. The whole team has a total of four laborers and plans to complete the weeding in ten days and save labor to reclaim five mu of wasteland within the same ten days. In Huoshigang Village, all 17 teams have completed a rush weeding of 500 mu. After the first and second weedings in Kong Village were largely completed, the village is now organizing all its labor to focus on the third and fourth weedings. Zhangdong Village has reorganized its mutual aid teams and plans to complete weeding of all autumn seedlings within two days. In Liu Jide's team in Zhu Village, there are 90 mu of small seedlings with ten laborers. Due to precise calculations, the small seedlings were weeded eight days early. Now, six laborers have been freed up to do short-term work. The primary school students in Huining District, after weeding their own 14 mu of land, also weeded 45 mu of autumn seedlings belonging to military families in two and a half days. During the rush weeding in Dongbaishan Village, the whole village, men and women, competed with each other. The seventh team, with a total of fifteen laborers, challenged the other mutual aid teams, proposing to create 100 dan of green manure during the weeding to ensure labor-saving transportation. Under the leadership of Chairman Yang Zhu, the women of the village organized thirteen teams, totaling forty-seven people. During the competition, they weeded 10 mu and 8 fen of seedlings on the first afternoon, and on the second day, seven women caught up with the work done by male full laborers. The village, with one hundred laborers, planned to complete the weeding in four and a half to five days, but actually completed it in three and a half days, saving more than 200 workdays. In Daxiang, the Guo Jianhao mutual aid team, with nineteen laborers, has completely weeded all 411 mu of autumn seedlings three times. They are now taking advantage of the gap in weeding to compost fertilizer, planning to compost 1,000 dan within three days. (Zhu Bo)
    [Another Dispatch] Xingtai farmers are carrying out a vigorous topdressing campaign to increase production and compensate for poor harvests. The farmers of Li Ma Village in the new district put forward slogans such as "Better to let the land be idle than the fertilizer," "Grasp green manure and make fertilizer for a full season harvest," and "Store grain, not fertilizer," mobilizing all vehicles, large and small, in the village to send fertilizer to the fields and carry out topdressing. Within four or five days, more than 250 mu had been topdressed. It is estimated that these 250 mu of autumn seedlings will increase production by at least 30 shi of grain. Wang Zenglin, head of the Beizhao Ma mutual aid team, said: "If the old fertilizer doesn't go out, the new fertilizer won't accumulate. I guarantee that the team I lead will apply topdressing." Village cadres in Nanggao Village proposed that cadres take the lead to ensure that topdressing is completed throughout the village in three days. The autumn seedlings in Lao Zaili Village that were topdressed are in stark contrast to those that were not: the topdressed autumn seedlings are growing green and lush, and it is estimated that each mu will yield at least four or five dou of grain more than those that were not topdressed. In Gong Village in the eleventh district, the whole village has universally applied topdressing once, and it is estimated that the whole village will increase production by 30 da shi of grain this year.

    [Our newspaper, Taiyue, 17th dispatch] On the 4th and 5th of this month, Gaoping Sanjiaqiu and 17 other villages held a joint meeting of village instructors and village heads to discuss ways to reduce disasters and increase production. After two days of discussion, it was unanimously agreed that increasing production is the way to reduce disasters. They immediately put forward the action slogan "Plant one fen more, harvest one fen more, reduce disaster by one fen," and set out a ten-day assault plan: 1. Completely eliminate ripe wasteland, reclaim a large amount of raw wasteland and gravesites, vigorously replant autumn vegetables and buckwheat, so that not one fen of land is left barren or empty; 2. Ensure that crops are weeded three times in the dog days and cotton is weeded seven times; 3. Prepare fertilizer for wheat fields and prepare wheat fields by plowing three times; 4. Continue to implement the saving of one he of rice, with every family eating half a dish of vegetables and half a bowl of rice; 5. Vigorously organize women and children, organize surplus labor to reclaim wasteland, with each person guaranteeing the reclamation of half a mu of raw wasteland, planting vegetables early, and planting wheat early. After the meeting, the villages immediately began to take action. Kouze, Taichenyan, Sanshen, and Jianning have suspended market days and concentrated manpower on reclaiming wasteland and replanting to strive to complete the work before the tenth.
