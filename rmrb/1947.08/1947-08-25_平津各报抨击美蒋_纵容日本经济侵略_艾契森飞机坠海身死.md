　　Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 23rd: According to an Associated Press dispatch from Beiping on the 22nd, the Chinese-language newspapers in Tianjin and Beijing have been commenting almost daily for weeks, criticizing the opening of trade with Japan. They believe that, with American assistance, Japan, the former enemy, is flooding China with Japanese goods, depriving China of the opportunity for economic recovery. It is said that within a few months, "Japanese merchants will be dragging their wooden clogs and wearing fierce expressions, once again running rampant throughout China." The Nationalist Party-sponsored *New Life Daily* also commented on MacArthur's headquarters approving the resumption of world trade for Japanese businesses, saying: "What a terrible picture that will be!"
    Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 23rd: Washington dispatch: Acheson, the American representative on the Allied Council for Japan and political advisor to MacArthur, died in a plane crash at sea on the 17th while returning to the United States. His body is missing, and a large number of important documents he was carrying were also lost. According to US officials, Acheson's purpose in returning to the United States was to discuss with the US government the peace treaty with Japan and policies on various issues in the Far East. Acheson was a 100% American imperialist and a key participant in formulating the "General Policy of the United States towards Japan," advocating that the United States should exclusively occupy Japan and exclude other allied countries. After Japan's surrender, he spared no effort to maintain the interests of Japanese *zaibatsu*, while adopting a cruel policy of repression against Japanese democratic forces. Before his death, he worked tirelessly to open up Japan's foreign trade and for the United States to convene a separate peace conference with Japan.

　　平津各报抨击美蒋  纵容日本经济侵略
  　艾契森飞机坠海身死
    【新华社陕北二十三日电】据美联社北平二十二日消息：平津的中文报纸，数周来几乎每天都著论评击开放对日贸易，他们认为，以前的敌人日本在美国援助下，源源以日货输入中国，将剥夺中国经济复员的机会。并说数月内“日本商人将拖着木履，带着凶恶的面孔，又要横行中国各地了”。国民党主办的新生报在论及麦克阿瑟总部核准日商恢复世界贸易时亦说：“那将是多么可怕的图画啊！”
    【新华社陕北二十三日电】华盛顿讯：对日委员会美方代表兼麦克阿瑟政治顾问艾契森，于十七日返美途中，因机失事堕海身死，尸体失踪，所携大批重要文件亦同归于尽。据美官方透露，艾氏返美目的，系与美政府商磋对日和约及对远东各项问题之政策。按艾氏乃百分之百的美国帝国主义分子，系制定“美国对日一般政策”实际参与者，主张美国独占日本，排斥其他盟国。日本投降后，曾敌方维护日本财阀之利益，对日本民主势力则采取残酷弹压政策。死前曾为开放日本对外贸易，及美国单独召开对日和约问题，奔走不遗余力。
