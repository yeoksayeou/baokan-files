Xinhua News Agency, Northeast, 9th. Keshan County, Hei-Nen Province, has achieved great success in arousing the class consciousness of the masses by collecting landlord nicknames, folk songs, and the history of landlords' wealth accumulation in the digging-out-landlord-property struggle. For example, the masses gave the large landlord Yang Junxue of Jiangjia Village the nickname "Yang the Great Hui," indicating that he was fierce towards the masses, extorted harshly, and specialized in calculating poor people. Zhong Baihe's nickname was "Grand Strategist," indicating that he was a village head during the puppet Manchukuo regime and specialized in giving bad ideas to harm poor people. Liu Yunfei's nickname was "Second Butcher," indicating that he specialized in killing poor people when he was the county magistrate of the puppet Manchukuo, the chief justice of the higher inspection court, and the chief of the trial division of the rural pacification bureau. The masses were very familiar with these nicknames, and after a little enlightenment, they immediately recognized their true faces, and their fighting spirit was even higher. For example, the masses of Jiangjia Village were dissatisfied with Yang Junwu's marriage to three wives, and they had long composed a song for him: "Coax the poor to buy land, collude with two sisters in a row." The ballad about Yang Junxue's second son, Yang Zhizhong, is: "Block the door and thirst people to death, seize the deaf man's young wife." These ballads are most likely to stimulate the hatred of the masses. Yang Junxue himself said: "I hire twelve or thirteen strong laborers every year, and my income is more than 460 shih of grain. In addition to expenses, I take out more than 250 shih of grain to buy land every year." This provides powerful evidence for the slogan of returning the wealth to everyone. In addition, the masses used the method of calculating labor to enlighten hired peasants to recognize the relationship of exploitation. After calculating the labor, the masses said: "We worked for the landlord for nothing, and we didn't even get half of it home. Why are we so poor!"

　　克山县斗争新经验
  　搜集地主绰号民谣
  　激发农民斗争情绪
    【新华社东北九日电】黑嫩省克山县在挖地产斗争中，搜集地主绰号、民谣、地主发家史等启发群众阶级觉悟，收效甚大。如姜家岗大地主杨钧学，群众给他起的外号叫“杨大回子”，说明他对群众厉害，勒索刻薄，专门计算穷人。钟百合外号叫“大谋士”，说明他在伪满时当屯长专出坏主意坑穷人。刘云飞外号“二屠户，”说明他当伪满县长，高等检查庭首席推事，清乡总局审判处长时专杀穷人，群众们对这些外号都很熟悉，稍加启示，便都马上认清他们真相，斗争情绪更加高涨。又如姜家岗群众对杨钧武娶三房老婆不满，老早就给他编了歌“拉拢穷人来买地，勾搭连环两姊妹”。对杨钧学二儿子杨执中的歌谣是“堵死门渴死人，霸占聋子小媳妇。”这些歌谣最能刺激群众的仇恨。杨钧学自己说：“我每年雇十二、三个抗活的，收入四百六十多石粮，除花用外，每年都拿出二百五十石粮买地”，这对财物大还家的口号作了一个有力的证实。此外群众并用算工方法启发雇农认清剥削关系，算工后，群众说：“白给地主做活了，自己连一半都没有得到家里来，为啥不受穷呢”！
