　　Ci County Sums Up Mutual Aid Experience
　Grasping the Current Demands of the Masses, Organize Them to Gradually Improve

　　[Our Newspaper News] Ci County summarized at the beginning of the month how to organize the masses from drought resistance and preparation for famine. According to their experience, mutual aid types can be divided into three types at the beginning: The first type is from large-scale organization to voluntary mutual aid, with the whole village universally organized. Most of these villages are in old revolutionary base areas and have had mutual aid before. These villages initially implemented large-scale labor exchange, without paying attention to equivalent value, resulting in many problems. Cadres and the masses realized the problems of inequivalence from practical experience and turned to voluntary mutual aid, starting to implement work points and paying attention to equivalent exchange. There are seventy-seven villages of this type in the county. The second type is to seize the masses' current common demands and organize them. For example, the masses in Guandong’ao needed to repair waterwheels, but their individual strength was small and they could not repair them, so they needed to be organized. The Eleventh District created a method of exchanging labor between workers and peasants, stipulating that blacksmiths earn fifteen points a day, carpenters thirteen points, and laborers ten points. They adopted labor exchange to repair waterwheels. Guandong'ao organized six groups in the whole village, and thirty-eight of the thirty-nine waterwheels were repaired, which could irrigate 300 mu of land. Siqian Street in the city needed one person just to buy and sell cotton in addition to ginning it. Thus, twelve cotton ginning mutual aid groups were organized, developing from twenty-two cotton ginning machines to eighty; Xigang seized the masses' demand for famine preparation and comprehensively organized transportation, vegetable picking, carrying, etc.; Zhongli organized the masses to dig wells, forming a movement. They were all automatically organized under voluntary and equivalent conditions. There are one hundred and fifty villages of this type in the county. The third type is that the masses use the old labor exchange habits to carry out small-scale temporary labor exchange without leadership. There are one hundred and twenty-seven villages of this type in the county. The above situation shows that the masses have a strong demand to be organized. The beginning of mutual aid is generally simple "fairness," and the organizational forms are diverse. The method of converting work is rough. However, as long as the masses are willing and like it, the leadership should boldly approve it and gradually improve it on the basis of the masses' actions.

　　磁县总结互助经验
  　抓住群众当前要求  组织起来逐步提高
    【本报讯】磁县于月初总结如何从抗旱备荒中组织群众，据他们的经验互助类型开始可分三种：第一种是从大编制到自愿互助，全村普遍组织起来。这种村大半是在老区曾有过互助的村，这些村开始实行大变工，没有注意等价，结果发生好多问题，干部群众从实际体验中认识到不等价碰钉子，便转向自愿互助，开始实行工票，注意等价交换。这类村全县有七十七个。第二种是抓住群众当前一点共同要求，组织起来。如关东凹修水车群众单独修力量小不能修，需要组织起来，十一区即创造工农换工办法，规定铁匠一天顶十五分，木匠顶十三分，劳力顶十分，采取工换工修水车，关东凹全村组织六个组，三十九辆水车即修起卅八辆能浇三百亩地。城里司前街轧花单独搞光买花卖花就得占一个人，于是组织起十二个轧花互助组，由二十二辆轧花车发展到八十辆；西岗抓住群众备荒要求，将运输、采菜、担挑等全面组织起来；钟离组织群众打井，形成运动。他们都是在自愿与等价条件下自动组织起来的。这类村全县有一百五十个。第三种是群众利用旧有的工拨工习惯进行小型临时的工换工，未加领导。全县这类村有一百二十七个。以上情况说明群众有强烈的组织起来要求，开始互助一般是简单“公道”，组织形式是多种多样的，折工办法是粗糙的。但是只要是群众愿意的喜欢的，领导上即应大胆批准，在群众行动的基础上逐步提高。
