　　Mutual Aid Team Leader Wang Xiwen
　　Pays Attention to Solving Difficulties of the Elderly and Weak
　　[Reported from Jinan, Hebei, by our newspaper on the 9th] Wang Xiwen, the mutual aid team leader of Xiangchenggu, Qiuxian County, has been praised for paying close attention to solving the difficulties of the elderly, weak, and widowed in production. When Wang Dayong, a bachelor, felt that cooking was delaying his work during the busy farming season, Xiwen immediately asked him to eat with him. Wang Dayong would provide two jin of coarse grains and three jin of firewood every day, and he would eat whatever Xiwen ate. Dayong was very happy, and his enthusiasm for production increased as a result. The widow Wang Chaishi cultivated seven mu of land, but last year, she only harvested an average of eleven and a half jin of coarse grains per mu, which was not enough to cover her expenses. She asked to join the mutual aid team with tears in her eyes, and Xiwen immediately agreed. The team was entirely responsible for cultivating her seven mu of land. When settling accounts this spring, a total of forty-two workdays were used, with each workday worth three jin of grain. At seventy yuan per jin of grain, it totaled two thousand nine hundred and forty yuan. Wang Chaishi spun cotton for others in the spring, spinning six liang per day, for a total of fifteen and a half jin. Her wages were five hundred yuan per jin, totaling seven thousand seven hundred and fifty yuan. After paying the labor costs, she had a surplus of four thousand eight hundred and ten yuan, which, when converted into coarse grains, was enough for her to live on for forty days.

    【本报冀南九日电】邱县香城固互助组长王希文，很注意解决老弱孤寡在生产中的困难获得称许。光棍汉王大用农忙时感到做饭误活，希文即叫他跟自己吃，每天拿粗粮二斤、柴三斤，希文吃啥他吃啥，大用很高兴，生产情绪由此高涨，寡妇王柴氏种七亩地，去年每亩平均只收十一斤半粗粮，还不够花销钱，她含着泪要求参加互助组，希文马上答应了，她七亩地全由组里负责种，今春结帐时，计共用工四十二个，每工三斤粮，每斤粮按七十元算，共合两千九百四十元。王柴氏春天给别人纺花，每天纺六两，共纺十五斤半，每斤工资五百元，共合七千七百五十元，除付工资外，还长余四千八百一十元，换成粗粮，足够她一个人四十天的生活费用。
