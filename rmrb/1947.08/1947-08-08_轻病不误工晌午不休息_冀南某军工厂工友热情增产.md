    [From Our Newspaper in Southern Hebei, 5th] Your reporter recently visited a certain ordnance factory, and the workers' intense work ethic in military construction is truly admirable. In June of this year, the output of work such as threshing grain increased two to four times compared to July of last year. The progress in technical improvements and inventions has also been significant over the past year. Chen Zhian's team invented a method of cutting fuse with a press, which is three-fifths faster than cutting with scissors. The wheel on the fuse-making machine has been enlarged, increasing the speed by more than three times. Due to the increased production rate and the scientific use of materials, 4 million yuan has been saved in just three or four months. The effectiveness of the manufactured firearms is greater than before. The workers' enthusiasm for production is indescribable. During the big rush in June, working night shifts became a common phenomenon. The factory could not stop it, and finally came up with a method of not issuing oil, so the workers all brought their own lamp oil to work. No one went to sleep at noon. In order to take care of everyone's health, the higher authorities had to issue an order that "you must sleep." Once, the eighth squad leader locked the workers' rooms, thinking they couldn't go out and would have to rest, but the workers all climbed out of the windows one by one and went to work. The sick always pretended to be not sick, stubbornly refusing to eat sick leave meals, and proposed slogans such as "Sweat more in the rear, bleed less at the front!" and "Minor injuries don't leave the front line, minor illnesses don't delay work!" This time, everyone in the factory except one person was commended, with Li Liqun receiving a special merit and thirteen people receiving a major merit.
    [From Our Newspaper in Southern Hebei, 5th] The "August 1st" Southern Hebei Military Region's military industry departments held a grand award ceremony. People from nearby villages also came to participate. The venue was filled with congratulatory plaques and banners, and the radio was broadcasting victory news and music. After the meeting opened with gun salutes, the elementary school students respectfully presented flowers to the heroes, and the leaders toasted the heroes. First, the comrade in charge of the department reported on the work summary of the year: In the past year, various factories have guaranteed the supply to the front, with output increasing by four and a half times, and the quality has also improved significantly. The power of a certain type of firearm is eight times stronger than last year, and the insurance period has been extended from 100 days to three years. Nine million yuan has been saved in four months. The next day, Deputy Political Commissar Sun of the Supply Department awarded the prizes and encouraged the heroes to continue to build on their achievements.

    轻病不误工晌午不休息
    冀南某军工厂工友热情增产
    【本报冀南五日电】日前记者访问某兵工厂、其军工建设，工人的紧张工作情况，实令人敬佩。今年六月间打谷子等工作产量，较去年七月份增加二倍至四倍。在技术的改进与发明上，一年来成绩也是很大的。陈治安班发明以压力机切导火索，比过去用剪子剪快五分之三，打导火索的机子加大轮快了三倍以上。由于生产速率增加及器材的科学使用，故在短短三四个月中，即节省了四百万元。制造出的火器效能较前为大。工人生产热情之高是难以形容的。六月大突击时，打夜工已成普遍的现象，厂方制止不住，终于想出不发油一法，工人们都自带灯油上工。午觉谁也不去睡。上级为了照顾大家身体，竟不得不下一道“非睡不可”的命令。有一次八班长把工人的住房锁了，想他们不能出门，可要休息了，工人们都一个个的从窗子上偷爬出，上工去了。病人总是装作没病似的，硬不吃病号饭，并提出：“后方多流汗，前方少流血”！“轻伤不下火线，轻病不误工”等口号。全厂此次除一人外，全部立了功，李立群获特等功，十三人记大功。
    【本报冀南五日电】“八一”冀南军区军工部门举行隆重贺功大会，附近村里群众也赶来参加，会场上贺匾、贺幛琳琅满目，收音机正在播送着胜利消息与音乐。鸣炮开会后，小学生们恭敬的向功臣们献花，首长们向功臣们敬酒。首先由该科负责同志报告一年工作总结：年来各厂保证了前方的供应，产量提高四倍半，质量也有显著的提高，某种火器较去年威力强八倍，保险期由百日延长至三年。并在四个月里节余九百万元。翌日，供给部孙副政委授奖，并勉励众功臣功上加功。
