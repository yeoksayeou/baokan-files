Xinhua News Agency, Central China, 30th. The Shanghai Ta Kung Pao's "Era Youth" column recently published the results of a current affairs quiz conducted by the publication. Among the answers, 168 people believed that the "Communist Army" (i.e., the People's Liberation Army) would ultimately win the civil war, while 93 people believed that the "Nationalist Army" (i.e., Chiang's army) would win. 424 people were completely dissatisfied with the reorganized Chiang government, while only 14 were satisfied. This test shows that even in Shanghai, the heart of Chiang's government where news is completely blocked, young people in the small and medium-sized citizen strata are increasingly recognizing the inevitable failure of Chiang's bandit's dictatorial civil war.

    上海市民预测战局
    认清蒋党必败
    【新华社华中三十日电】上海大公报“时代青年”栏近发表该刊举行时事测验的结果，答案中相信“共军”（即人民解放军）特在内战中获致最后胜利者一百六十八，相信“国军”（即蒋军）获胜者九十三人。对改组后的蒋政府完全不满意者四百二十四人，满意者仅十四人。这个测验说明了虽在蒋政府统治心脏区新闻完全被封锁的上海，在中小市民层青年中，已日益认识蒋贼独裁内战必然失败之前途。
