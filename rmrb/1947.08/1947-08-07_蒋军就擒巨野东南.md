Xinhua News Agency, Jin-Lu-Yu Front, August 5th: Frontline reporters reported the process of capturing Song Ruike, commander of the 66th Division of Chiang's army, and his brigade and regimental commanders at Yangshanji: On the evening of July 27th, the People's Liberation Army launched a general attack on Yangshanji, and by dawn the next day, most of the houses in Yangshanji were occupied, and more than 400 remaining enemies were compressed into a high building and two bungalows in the northern corner of Yangshan. Ge Yuxia, the political instructor of the Second Company of a certain regiment of the People's Liberation Army, led two platoons to capture the enemy's guns in the two bungalows through fierce attacks and shouting, and then approached the last high building. The soldiers shouted: "Those who surrender will not be killed, the Eighth Route Army will treat prisoners kindly." At this time, an officer with a handlebar mustache walked out of the north room, ran out in a panic, raised his hands and shouted: "Don't fight, don't fight." He respectfully said to Instructor Ge: "My name is Guo Yulin, I am the chief of staff of this division, please come in, there are still officers inside." Instructor Ge then walked into the yard, and a short officer wearing a helmet upside down and in military uniform walked out of the north room, forced a smile, and bowed respectfully to Instructor Ge. Guo Yulin introduced: "This is our division commander, Song Ruike." Song Ruike only trembled and said: "We have too many casualties inside." He lowered his head and remained silent. This confidant of Chiang Kai-shek and Chen Cheng, who once participated in the Luoshan Executive Group meeting of the Military Mediation Department as the chief representative of the Kuomintang, and who fired the first shot of the civil war to attack Li Xiannian's Central Plains Military Region, finally fell into the hands of the People's Liberation Army after only a year. After Song Ruike and others surrendered, the guard following Instructor Ge shouted loudly into the room: "Your division commander and chief of staff are out, brigade commander and regimental commander should also come out." Then five officers wearing helmets upside down walked out of the four rooms, including Deputy Chief of Staff Wang Kaishi, Brigade Commander of the 185th Brigade Tu Huantao, Chief of Staff Ma Quanzhi, Regiment Commander of the 553rd Regiment Luo Yusheng, and Regiment Commander of the 554th Regiment Li Chicheng. Guo Yulin introduced them one by one. The 66th Division of Chiang's army ended here.

	The 70th Division Had No Fighting Spirit - Scattered and Fled When Surrounded
	Xinhua News Agency, Jin-Lu-Yu Front, August 4th: Liu Xueji, the lieutenant colonel chief of staff of the 70th Division of Chiang's army, who laid down his weapons at Liuyingji in Junan on July 14th, recently narrated the demise of the division and the 32nd Division, saying: "There are only eight words for the reason why the 70th Division and the 32nd Division were annihilated: The soldiers had no fighting spirit and the generals were panicked. This is the terminal illness of the entire Kuomintang army." He said: "Since General Liu Bocheng's troops crossed the Yellow River on June 30th, the staff headquarters of our Wang Corps (Wang Jingjiu) has been in chaos, changing orders in the morning and evening, at a loss. Our staff officers at all levels were holding small red flags day and night, facing military maps, not knowing where to insert them. Everyone up and down knew there was an enemy situation, but no one knew what the People's Liberation Army's intentions were. Some said to take Yuncheng and then Heze, some said to take Yuncheng and then Jining. Until Yuncheng was surrounded on the 4th and things became tense, my division gathered in Jinxiang, and the generals were still arguing endlessly. On the 5th, we were ordered to move to Jiaxiang, but when we arrived at Zhifangjie at night, we were suddenly ordered to move to Jining. We rushed non-stop overnight and arrived in Jining on the 6th. People and horses were exhausted. On the 9th, we were ordered to move into Jiaxiang to ensure Jiaxiang. But on the 10th, we were ordered to leave behind the 278th Regiment and advance to Juye. When we arrived at Yangguantun (12 miles east of Juye) on the 11th, we suddenly heard that the 66th Division of Yangshanji was surrounded, so all the troops were shocked. No one knew where the People's Liberation Army came from. The commander of the Wang Corps rushed back to Xuzhou from Jinxiang, and at the same time hurriedly ordered my division to gather at Liuyingji and get close to the 32nd Division in Dushan to embolden each other. At this point, the situation of giving gifts was formed, and the People's Liberation Army surrounded us step by step. Our officers and soldiers were extremely panicked. On the afternoon of the 13th, after Division Commander Tang of the 32nd Division led his troops to Liuyingji, he discussed with Division Commander Chen and decided to break through to Jiaxiang that night, but suddenly received a telegram from the commander of the Wang Corps, firmly forbidding any movement. On the morning of the 14th, another telegram ordered the two divisions to advance side by side, experiencing the encirclement of Yangshan independently. As soon as the troops left Liuyingji, they unexpectedly encountered a head-on attack by the People's Liberation Army at Caojialou. Many officers and soldiers were inexplicably shot and fell to the ground, struggling and twitching like a rooster with its throat cut. So they had to retreat to Liuyingji. Although the People's Liberation Army did not follow into Liuyingji at this time, in fact, we had already collapsed, and everyone had begun to plan their own way out. That night, just as we were helpless, we suddenly received an order from Commander-in-Chief Gu (Gu Zhutong), deciding to break through the Zhifangjie defense line in six routes. Unexpectedly, the black horse cavalry regiment of the People's Liberation Army had already occupied the area." At this point, Lieutenant Colonel Liu described the scene of the annihilation of the breakthrough that night with great frustration, saying: "It was dark at the time, and everyone was rushing to run out. Less than ten meters out of Liuyingji, the squad leader could not find the soldiers. People shouted and horses neighed. The People's Liberation Army's gunfire came from all directions. The chaotic soldiers ran east for a while like madmen, and turned around and ran west for a while when they heard gunfire. Artillery vehicles, ammunition, pack mules, cavalry, and ox carts all lost control. It was really chaotic soldiers, chaotic generals, chaotic people, chaotic horses, chaotic carts, chaotic artillery, chaotic rushing, chaotic bumping, chaotic shouting, chaotic calling. Even the wounded and the sick who were knocked down were trampled to death by people and horses before they could stand up again." Liu said that he personally saw Jiang Shuping, the battalion commander of the Second Battalion of the 177th Regiment, wounded and lying down, trampled to death by the division commander's horse, and the division commander and deputy division commander were finally captured after losing their hats and only one guard left by their side. Finally, Lieutenant Colonel Liu said with infinite emotion: "Our 70th Division was transferred to Taiwan to receive training and equipment immediately after the Japanese surrender, for a full year and a half. Except for Brigade Commander Xie Maoquan, who had already been captured, the entire division's manpower was used in the battlefield for only one day on July 14th, less than twenty-four hours."

	A Major Victory Over Chiang's Troops at Liuyingji - A Certain Battalion of Mine Captured More Than a Thousand Enemies
	Xinhua News Agency, Jin-Lu-Yu Front, August 3rd: On the evening of July 14th, the enemy besieged in Liuyingji, after being silent for two hours, suddenly bombarded the east and north of the village with more than a dozen large cannons and dozens of light and heavy machine guns. At the same time, the sound of artillery vehicles rolling and the neighing of countless mules and horses were heard from the northeast corner of the village and the east and north gates. Li Zanxiang, the battalion commander of the Third Battalion of a certain Wujiang unit, wisely determined that the enemy was about to break through, and he immediately issued combat orders. After twenty minutes of shelling by Chiang's artillery fire, they all broke through. The chaotic troops poured out from the east gate and the north gate. Our soldiers waiting for the attack hid in the fortifications of the position and monitored the enemy. After two days and nights of encirclement, more than 20,000 Chiang's troops from the 32nd and 70th Divisions besieged in Liuyingji had long been exhausted from hunger and had no fighting spirit. As soon as they rushed out of the village gate, they scattered and fled after coming into contact with us. The foolish Chiang's officers still wanted to reorganize the troops, but our soldiers fired continuously, and the shells accurately exploded in front of them. Several commanders fell to the ground on the spot, and the rest abandoned their troops and fled for their lives. At this time, the sound of our army's all-out attack rang out, and countless light and heavy machine guns swept across the ground. Shells exploded one after another in the enemy's ranks. The brave men raised their bayonets and cut the enemy into several sections. Our army slowly surrounded the enemy from the left and right. The chaotic Chiang's troops became even more defeated. Officers could not find their own troops, machine gunners could not find ammunition carriers. Abandoned foreign horses shouted and rushed wildly in the wilderness. Artillery and ammunition vehicles fell sideways on both sides of the highway. Chiang's soldiers threw away their weapons and hid in the sorghum fields, waiting to be prisoners. A combat team of the Eighth Squad of the Ninth Company captured more than sixty prisoners at one time and seized four mountain guns. Che Jinbao, a communication soldier of the battalion headquarters, captured sixteen Chiang's troops with one grenade and also brought a light machine gun. Buglers, telephone operators, and even bare-handed cooks also automatically went to capture groups of three or five Chiang's troops who had scattered. The enemy's resistance stopped. The loud contact signals of our army rang out everywhere in the open field of more than ten miles in radius. The brave men shouted: "Those who surrender will not be killed." Chiang's troops shouted: "Comrades, I have a gun here." "Comrades, there is a cannon here." The shouts, calls, and signals echoed together. For the whole night, the two entire divisions of Chiang's 32nd and 70th Divisions were so simply and completely annihilated. The Third Battalion of a certain unit, standing at the forefront of the battle, captured 1,200 prisoners, seized six mountain guns, two mortars, thirty-seven light and heavy machine guns, thirteen grenade launchers, six hundred and twenty rifles, fourteen war horses, and nine large carts loaded with ammunition, without any casualties themselves, creating a zero to one thousand two hundred, writing a glorious miracle in the history of the self-defense war.

    蒋军就擒巨野东南
    宋瑞珂俯首就擒郭雨林乞求饶命
    【新华社冀鲁豫前线五日电】前线记者报导羊山集蒋军六十六师师长宋瑞珂及其旅团长被俘经过：七月廿七日黄昏，人民解放军向羊山集发起总攻，次日拂晓即将羊山集大部民房占领，残敌四百余被压缩至羊山北角的一所高楼和两所平房内。解放军某团二连政指葛玉霞，率领两个排以猛攻和喊话，收缴了两所平房内敌人的枪支，即逼近最后那所高楼。战士们即高喊着：“缴枪不杀，八路军优待俘虏。”这时从北屋走出一个长着八字胡的军官，慌慌张张跑出来举起双手连喊：“不要打了，不要打了。”他向葛指导员恭恭敬敬的说：“我们投降，我们只有一个要求，请同志们饶命。”这个军官并自我介绍说：“我姓郭名雨林，是本师参谋长，请你进去，里面还有长官。”葛指导员便走进院子去，一个倒戴盔帽，身着军便服的矮个子军官，就从北屋走出来，强作笑容，规规矩矩的向葛指导员行了个礼。郭雨林介绍说：“这就是我们的师长宋瑞珂。”宋瑞珂只颤抖着说了一句：“咱们里头伤亡太大了。”就低下头去不做声。这一个蒋介石陈诚的亲信，曾以国民党首席代表资格参加军调部罗山执行小组会议，而又是图攻我中原军区李先念部打内战第一枪的宋瑞珂，时仅一年，终落入人民解放军之手。宋瑞珂等俯首投降后，这时跟葛指导员的警卫员向屋子里高喊：“你们的师长、参谋长都出来了，旅长、团长也出来吧。”接着从四个屋子里又走出来五个倒戴军帽的军官，其中有师副参谋长王开石、一八五旅旅长涂焕陶、参谋长马权之、五五三团团长罗玉胜、五五四团团长李炽生。郭雨林一一作介绍。蒋军六十六师就此结束。
    七十师兵无斗志  被包围四散奔逃
    【新华社冀鲁豫前线四日电】七月十四日在巨南六营集放下武器的蒋军七十师上校参谋处长刘学基，顷叙述该师和三十二师覆灭的经过称：“七十师及三十二师被歼原因只有八个字：兵无斗志将帅恐慌。这是整个国民党军的膏盲之症。”他说：“自刘伯承将军所部于六月三十日渡过黄河之后，我们王兵团（王敬久）的参谋部里就手忙脚乱，朝令夕改，莫知所措了。弄得我们各级参谋人员，日夜拿着小红旗面对着军用地图，不知该往那里插，上下一样，两眼漆黑，人人皆知有敌情，但谁也不知解放军意图何在。有人说下郓城取菏泽，有人说下郓城取济宁：直到四日郓城被包围吃紧，我师集结金乡后，将帅依然争论不休）五日奉命转进嘉祥，但夜达纸房街时，忽又命令转到济宁。连夜马不停蹄，六日赶到济宁，人困马乏，九日又奉命进驻嘉祥确保嘉祥。但十日又奉命除留二七八团外，全部向巨野前进。待十一日进抵杨官屯（巨野东十二里）后，忽闻羊山集六十六师被围，于是全部人马大吃一惊。解放军究从何处来，谁也不得而知。王兵团指挥官一面由金乡急返徐州，一面连忙命令我师集结六营集，与独山之三十二师靠近，相互壮胆。至此送礼形势已成，人民解放军步步围近，我官兵惶恐万状。十三日下午，三十二师唐师长率部到六营集后，与陈师长商定，当夜向嘉祥突围，但忽又接王兵团指挥官来电，坚不准动。及十四日晨又电令两师并进，经独在的羊山之围。部队刚出六营集，想不到在曹家楼突然遭解放军迎头痛击，许多官兵莫明其妙突然中弹，象割断喉管的大公鸡一样，乱蹶乱跳。于是只得退驻六营集，这时虽然解放军并未跟踪进入六营集，但实际上我们已溃不成军，人人都已开始计划自己的道路了。当夜正在无可奈何之际，忽又接顾总司令（顾祝同）命令，决定分六路向纸房街防地突围。不料解放军之黑马骑兵团早已占领该地，至此刘上校十分沮丧的形容当晚突围被歼灭的情景说：当时天黑，大家争着往外跑，一出六营不到十公尺，班长就找不到士兵了，人喊马叫，解放军的枪声从四面八方打过来乱兵们象疯人一样，向东跑一阵，一听枪响转身又向西跑一阵，炮车、弹药、驮骡、骑马、牛车全部失掉了管制，那真是乱兵、乱将、乱人、乱马、乱车、乱炮、乱冲、乱撞、乱喊、乱叫，彩号病号甚至撞挤倒了的人，都来不及重新站起来，就被人马活活踏死，刘说他亲眼看见一七七团二营营长江树屏负伤卧倒，被师长的马踏死，而正副师长也终于在丢掉了帽子之后，身边剩下一个卫士而被俘。最后，刘上校又无限感慨的说：我们七十师自日寇投降后，即开赴台湾接受训练装备，足足一年半，除掉谢懋权旅长早已被俘外，而全师人马用之战场，仅仅不过七月十四日一天内不足二十四小时的时间而已。
    六营集大破蒋军  我某营俘敌千余
    【新华社冀鲁豫前线三日电】七月十四日黄昏，被围于六营集的敌人，在沉寂了两小时之后，突然以十几门大炮和几十挺轻重机枪，向村东村北猛烈轰击。同时在该村东北角和东、北两个寨门内，发出炮车的滚动声，和无数骡、马的嘶叫声。我乌江某部三营李赞香营长，机智的断定敌人要突围了，他立即下了作战命令。蒋军炮火轰击了二十分钟后，就全部突围。杂乱的队伍由东门和北门涌出来，我静待出击的战士们，隐蔽在阵地的工事内，监视着敌人。经过两昼夜的围困，三十二师、七十师两万多局守在六营集的蒋军，早已困饿疲惫不堪，毫无斗志，刚涌出寨门，一经与我接触就四散奔逃。愚蠢的蒋家军官，还想整顿一下队伍，但我士兵连续发炮，炮弹准确的在他们的面前爆炸了，几个指挥官当场倒地，其余的丢下队伍，各自逃命。这时，我军全力出击的号声响了，无数挺轻重机枪横扫过地面，炮弹一个接着一个在敌军群里开了花。勇士们端起刺刀把敌人切成数段，我军从左从右慢慢地把敌人包围起来了，混乱的蒋军，愈加溃不成军，军官找不到自己的部队，机枪手找不到弹药手，丢弃的洋马在旷野里乱叫乱闯，大炮和弹药车东倒西歪的摔在公路两侧。蒋军士兵们抛掉武器，隐藏在高粱地里，等待着当俘虏。九连八班的一个战斗小组，一次捉到六十多个俘虏，缴获四门山炮。营部通讯员车金保，用一颗手榴弹捉来了十六个蒋军，还带着一挺轻机枪。号兵、电话员和赤手空拳的伙马夫，也自动去捉三五成群跑散了的蒋军。敌人的抵抗停止了，在方圆十来里的旷野上，到处吹起我军响亮的联络号音，勇士们连喊：“缴枪不杀。”蒋军则连呼：“同志，我这里有一枝枪。”“同志这里还有一门炮。”喊声呼声号声响成一片，整整一夜，蒋军三十二师和七十师两个整师，就这样干脆彻底的全部被歼灭了。站在战斗最前线的某部第三营，捉了一千二百个俘虏，缴获六门山炮，两门迫击炮，三十七挺轻重机枪，十三个掷弹筒，六百二十枝步枪，十四匹战马，和满载弹药的九辆大车，而自己没有一个伤亡，创造了零比一千二百，为自卫战争史上写下了光辉的奇迹。
