Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 11th. After a week-long "visit" to North and Northeast China, Wedemeyer has now begun his trip to southern China. Wedemeyer is scheduled to fly to Taiwan today (the 11th) from Nanjing. United Press reported from Nanjing on the 9th that Wedemeyer believed that if he did not go to Taiwan to see it for himself, "his 'trip' in China could not be considered complete." Wedemeyer's emphasis on his trip to Taiwan is, of course, related to the U.S. plan to invade Taiwan. As early as last year, the United States began building the Kaohsiung seaport in southern Taiwan and the Taichung air base. Chiang Kai-shek sold these two locations to repay the United States for secretly aiding Chiang with military supplies via Taiwan. The construction of the two locations was originally scheduled to be completed in February and June of this year. Recently, the two major ports of Keelung and Taipei were resold by Chiang Kai-shek to the United States as conditions for this loan of 1.5 to 2 billion. The United States has coveted Taiwan for a long time. On July 27th, the director of the Kaohsiung Harbor Bureau in Taiwan, Lin Ze-bin, revealed that during the war against Japan, the United States planned to expand the Kaohsiung port to a scale that could accommodate 80 ten-thousand-ton ships after occupying Taiwan. During the Taiwan autonomy movement in March of this year, a New York newspaper close to the White House, using Chiang Kai-shek's incompetence as an excuse, proposed that "Taiwan should be jointly administered by the United Nations" (as published in the Shanghai "Wen Cui Congkan" in April of this year), revealing the United States' desire to directly rule Taiwan. Chiang Kai-shek's replacement of Chen Yi with Wei Daoming to govern Taiwan is said to be in accordance with American tastes, as Wei is liked by the United States. The United States' choice of Taiwan to cooperate with Japan in training Kuomintang troops is to facilitate the large-scale entry of American forces and to make the Japanese a powerful assistant in the United States' foothold in Taiwan. United Press reported on the 9th that Wedemeyer went to Taiwan to "see for himself why Taiwan was 'fine' under Japanese rule, but problems arose under Chinese (referring to the Chiang government) rule." Prior to this, Jun Ashida, the foreign minister of the reactionary Japanese Katayama government, a puppet of the United States, openly demanded that Japan have the special right to immigrate to Taiwan; reactionary Japanese congressmen also demanded that a "referendum" be held in Taiwan, attempting to re-rule Taiwan with the support of the United States.

Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 11th. United Press Shanghai, 9th, confirmed that the United States has already begun to implement a new plan to train Chiang's army, including the navy, army, and air force; and confirmed that American aircraft seized Chinese military bases. The report stated: "The U.S. Army Advisory Group plans to establish training schools in Taiwan, and its current plan is to train six infantry combat divisions to participate in the Chinese civil war. Training plans have already been carried out in the Chinese mainland, and various schools have been established; this is a separate plan. People from all walks of life in Nanjing said: The Army Advisory Group plans to establish an infantry and artillery school in Tangshan, twenty miles near Nanjing, and an army school in Xuzhou, planning to establish a coastal defense school in Taiwan, and a cavalry school in Tianshui (in eastern Gansu) in western China. The aviation school near Hangzhou has already started, but it is still small in scale, and there are also plans to train aviation personnel in Chengdu. It is believed that the comprehensive training plan requires at least twenty government (Chiang) divisions to be trained. In addition, there is a "plan to train the (Kuomintang) navy," which is said to be "Taiwan is also suitable for training the Chinese (Chiang) navy." The above extensive plan "means expanding the U.S. military advisory group, which now has one thousand two hundred people and many non-military personnel." United Press stated: At the same time, "the U.S. military wants to establish a naval base in Keelung or Kaohsiung, Taiwan."

　　美国攫取台湾
  　魏德迈飞台实地勘察
  　美训练蒋军计划开始实行
    【新华社陕北十一日电】魏德迈在作过华北及东北的一周“访问”后，现又开始其中国南部之行。魏氏定今日（十一日）由南京飞台湾。合众社南京九日电称：魏德迈认为他如果不去台湾亲自看看，“他在中国的‘旅行’就不能算完成。”魏德迈如此重视其台湾之行，当然与美国侵略台湾之计划有关。早在去年，美国即开始建筑台湾南部高雄海港和台中飞机基地，该两地之出卖，系蒋介石用以报答美国经由台湾以军火秘密援蒋者，两地工程原定今年二月和六月完成。最近基隆、台北两巨港，复被蒋介石出卖给美国作为此次十五亿至二十亿贷款的条件。美国对台湾之觊觎为时已久，上月二十七日台湾高雄港务局长林则彬之谈话泄露：在对日战争中美国即打算于占领台湾后将高雄港扩充为可停泊八十艘万吨轮船的规模。今年三月台湾自治运动期中，接近白宫之纽约某报，即借口蒋介石统治之无能，提出“台湾应由联合国共管”（今年四月沪“文萃丛刊”载），显露美国直接统治台湾之欲望。蒋介石以魏道明代陈仪主台，据云亦为适应美国口味，魏为美国所喜故。美国之将台湾选择为与日本合作训练国民党军队，即为便利于美国势力之大规模进入，并使日本人成为美国插足台湾之得力助手。合众社九日电称：魏德迈到台湾是要“亲自看看为何在日本统治之下台湾会‘无事’，而在中国（指蒋政府）统治下反而会发生问题”。在这以前，美国的傀儡反动的日本片山政府外相芦田均曾公开要求日本有移民台湾特权；日本反动议员并曾要求在台举行“公民投票”，妄图借美国扶植，重新统治台湾。
    【新华社陕北十一日电】合众社上海九日电，证实美国业已开始实行新的训练蒋军计划，包括海陆空军在内；并证实美国飞机攫取中国军事基地。该电称：“美国陆军顾问团计划在台湾成立训练学校，其当前计划为训练六个步兵战斗师以便参加中国内战。中国本部原已进行训练计划，业已办有各种学校；这是另外的计划。南京各界人士称：陆军顾问团计划在南京附近二十里的汤山建立步炮学校，在徐州建立陆军学校拟于台湾设立岸防学校，拟于中国西部之天水（在甘肃东部）设立骑兵学校。杭州附近的航空学校业已开始，但规模尚小，另外还计划在成都训练航空人员。众信全面训练计划要求至少训练二十个政府（蒋）师团。此外并有“训练（国民党）海军的计划”，据称“台湾同样适合于训练中国（蒋）海军。”上项广泛计划“意味将扩大美军顾问团，现该团有一千二百人及许多非军事的职员。”合众社称：与此同时，“美军欲在台湾的基隆或高雄建立海军基地。”
