Delineate Class Lines, Break Down Sectarianism
Willow Forest Village Unites for Re-examination
[Our newspaper, Ji-Lu-Yu, 4th dispatch] Willow Forest Village, a backward village in the third district of Dong'a, kicked aside sectarian cliques, identified the enemy and ourselves, and launched a re-examination campaign. This village had long been a sluggish and backward village, and the basic masses had not been emancipated. This time, a certain agency from the county stationed itself in the village to carry out village work and investigate the situation. The Liu family in the front street of the village was relatively poor, while the Yang family in the back street was relatively wealthy, and the landlords took advantage of the gap to provoke the masses to engage in sectarianism. At the same time, the fruits of past struggles had not been distributed, and the masses were dissatisfied with the village cadres, so the landlords were still blatantly arrogant in the village. Based on this situation, everyone decided to kick aside the sectarian cliques, first hold a "Cleansing the Mind Meeting", delineate class lines, identify the enemy and ourselves, and let the village cadres conduct self-reflection. At this time, the village cadres realized that they had been fooled by the landlords on the one hand, and on the other hand, they felt that the masses had risen up, and they had no choice but to act, so most of the village cadres admitted their mistakes to the masses. After the class lines were clearly drawn, the level of awareness was greatly improved, and those who had been deceived by the landlords and concealed things also confessed one after another. When discussing the distribution of the fruits of struggle, some advocated "reaching out for a share", but the poor peasant Wang Tianhai said, "Reaching out for a share would be a great disadvantage for the poor." As a result, whoever was short of something got that thing, and each household first wrote out a list and posted it on the things they wanted, and then everyone discussed and evaluated who should get what, and whoever should get it got it. This greatly boosted everyone's enthusiasm.

    划阶级打破宗派
    柳林屯团结复查
    【本报冀鲁豫四日电】东阿三区落后村柳林屯踢开宗派圈子，认清敌我后，掀起复查。该村是长期疲塌的落后村，基本群众没有得到翻身。这次县里某机关驻到该村，进行驻村工作，进行调查了解情况，该村前街姓刘的较贫，后街姓杨的较富，地主便利用空隙挑拨群众闹宗派。同时过去斗争果实没有分，群众对村干不满，因此地主仍在村里大模大样的撑劲。根据这样情况，大家研究决定踢开宗派圈子，先开“清心会”，划分阶级，认清敌我，让村干进行反省。这时村干一方面感觉上了地主的当，另一方面感觉群众已经起来了，不干也不行，所以大部分村干向群众承认了错误。划清了阶级以后，觉悟大大提高，被地主欺骗隐藏东西的也都纷纷自报出来。讨论分果实时，有的主张“伸手算一份”，但贫农王天海说“伸手分一份，穷人可吃大亏啦”。结果是谁少啥分啥，自家先写出单来，贴到愿要的东西上，再经大家评议，谁该要就给谁，这样大家劲头很大。
