　　Organizing Sideline Production to Buy Grain for Famine Relief
  　Remarkable Achievements in Credit Work in Licheng

    [This newspaper, Licheng News] The Licheng County United Credit Cooperative and the Jinnan Bank County Branch convened a meeting of 35 credit cooperatives and more than a dozen cooperatives with credit business in the county at the end of July to summarize the credit work of the past six months. In the past six months, in addition to issuing a large number of agricultural and textile loans, it has also played a significant role in production and famine relief. Its achievements and practices are as follows: 1. After the summer harvest, seize the slack season of farming, and use a large number of loans to organize the masses to carry out sideline production, earning profits to exchange for grain or helping the masses buy grain to overcome famine. For example, the Dongbei Credit Cooperative lent 160,000 yuan to the transportation team, and the masses gained 90,000 yuan in profit. Xiaguihua lent 300,000 yuan, combined with private funds, to help the masses buy 12 shi of corn and 6 shi of rice. Tinghepou helped small cooperatives with transportation loans of 320,000 yuan, and gave the masses more than 3 shi of wheat in exchange for rice (at a rate of 1 shi for 1 shi). Beiliu and Tinghepou helped oil workshops to buy cotton seeds to squeeze oil and store the oil cakes for famine relief. Cheyuan organized the masses to carry county goods. Chen Yuquan borrowed 10,000 yuan and made six trips carrying and selling eggs in one month, earning more than 16,000 yuan. 2. Directly store grain or store substitute foods to prepare for famine. Beiliu transferred funds to store 45 shi of rice, Xiaguihua stored more than 20 shi of rice, Henan bought 20 shi of bran, and Sidi bought 1,200 jin of bran. It was also decided to lend bran to the masses as a loan. 3. Help the masses buy late-season seeds. Dongguan bought 30 jin of rapeseed, while Tinghepou lent to small cooperatives, and the small cooperatives went to Wuxiang area to buy buckwheat seeds, each small cooperative lent 30,000 to 40,000 yuan. 4. Organize the masses to save, gather small amounts into large amounts, and buy grain for famine relief. For example, Dongbei had serious waste in the past. Since the establishment of the credit cooperative, it has organized collective deposits for transportation. Whoever needs it can withdraw it to prevent waste. For example, Cao Genhe saved 45,000 yuan in small amounts and received 450 yuan in interest. He happily took it out to buy grain. The Tinghepou Cooperative sold cloth for the masses, and the money earned was used as a deposit, which could be withdrawn when needed. Beiliu exchanged cloth for grain for the masses. Langou absorbed medicinal materials from the masses, Sidi absorbed peppercorns, and Dongyadi absorbed hemp, all of which were combined with cooperative business operations to organize production and sales as deposits. After discussion, commendations were given for meritorious service. Everyone clarified how credit work should be carried out in famine relief, and set out plans to work harder in the future, organize various idle funds of the masses, and vigorously support production and famine relief.

　　组织副业买粮备荒
  　黎城信用工作成绩显著
    【本报黎城讯】黎城县联社及冀南银行县支行，于七月底召开了全县三十五人信用部及十几个有信用业务的合作社会议，总结半年信用工作。半年来除发放了大批农贷纺贷外，在生产备荒上也起了很大作用，其成绩与作法如下：一、夏收以后，抓紧农忙空隙，以大量贷款组织群众进行副业生产，得利换回粮食或帮助群众买粮渡荒。如董北信用部贷给运输队十六万元，群众得利九万元。下桂花贷款三十万，结合私人资金，帮助群众买玉茭十二石，米六石。停河铺帮助小型合作社运输贷款三十二万元，并给群众以麦子换米三石多（以一石换一石。）北流、停河铺，帮助油坊收买棉籽榨油把油饼存起来准备渡荒用。车元组织群众担挑县洋，陈玉泉贷款一万元，一月担挑贩鸡蛋六次，赚洋一万六千余元。二、直接存粮或储存代食品，准备渡荒。北流抽调资金存米四十五石，下桂花存米二十余石，河南买糠二十石，寺底买糠一千二百斤。并确定以糠贷给群众作为贷款。三、帮助群众购买晚种籽。东关买菜籽三十斤，停河铺则是贷给小型社，由小型社到武乡一带买荞麦子，每个小型社贷三、四万元。四、组织群众节约，集零为整，买粮渡荒。如董北过去浪费现象严重，自成立信用部后，组织运输集体存款，谁用时再取，防止浪费。如曹根河零星存下四万五千元，还得了四百五十元利，高兴的取上买粮。停河铺合作社替群众卖布，卖下钱即作为存款，用时即取。北流则替群众以布换粮。兰沟吸收群众药材，寺底吸收花椒，东崖底吸收麻，均系和社务营业结合，组织生产推销出去作为存款。经讨论后并进行了评选立功，大家都明确了信用工作在渡荒中如何活动，定出计划今后要更加努力，组织群众各种游资，大力扶助生产渡荒。　　（峻田、士德）
