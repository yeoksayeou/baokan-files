　　Thinking from Another Perspective
  　Some Experiences from the Xinhua Bookstore's "Land Reform" Study
    Wang Chun
    　　　　I. Integrating with Work and Mass Movements
    The Xinhua Bookstore's "Land Reform" study was initially spurred by the needs of the work itself. Originally, ordinary office workers, especially cultural workers, were most likely to be detached from reality, ignoring what the masses were doing and only focusing on their own desk work, paying no attention to external affairs. However, since the beginning of the land reform movement last year, the correspondence section of the bookstore and the editorial department of "New Masses" have continuously received thousands of letters from readers; many of these letters used questions as a pretext to attack "Land Reform" itself, with very few genuinely and sincerely asking questions. Nevertheless, when someone asks, you have to give them an answer. For a long time, individual responsible comrades were driven by this need for work to learn some principles. Later, when "digging out hidden elements" and "cutting off tails" came, even more letters questioning "Land Reform" arrived; for several months this year, the relationship between the editorial department, the correspondence section, and the readers almost formed a phenomenon centered solely on discussing issues in "Land Reform." At this time, the needs of the work pressed down even harder, and most comrades felt that they had to study hard. Precisely because this study was naturally closely integrated with the work, among some comrades who had been tempered for a relatively long time, they were able to realize earlier that this was a matter of class standpoint, thereby first clearing their own minds and gaining a clearer understanding. This was of great significance for carrying out the "Land Reform" study later.

    Comrade Zhao Shuli paid particular attention to the mass movement in the villages. Under his organization and promotion, Comrade Wang Chun and several other people from the bookstore jointly formed a village work group; they participated in the entire process from the small group deliberation in the mass movement to the mass struggle meetings. Later, they even called on all comrades to participate, to help the masses find hidden grain, maintain order in the meeting place, reason with the masses, and support them. Afterwards, they would hold discussions about their feelings and compare principles. This played a significant role in using examples, comparing standpoints, inspiring thoughts, and transforming emotions in the study process, making many people who casually claimed "I have no opinion on the revolution" and rigidly insisted "My family has no exploitation" feel that there was room for consideration.

    The above illustrates that if we, as cultural workers in government organizations, want to carry out the "Land Reform" study well, we must find ways to integrate work, study, and life with the mass movement. Otherwise, for us, simply writing books and not dealing with affairs, studying this and doing that, and watching the struggle as if attending a temple fair, the study will still be empty talk or futile debate, and it will inevitably be in vain.

    　　　　II. Differentiating Components, Identifying Key Points
    The composition of the bookstore staff can be roughly divided into three categories: the first category is a few comrades who have been tempered for a relatively long time. We organized a study committee for them, which played a leading role in the study; the second category is a few struggle targets who had infiltrated, and we let the masses take them back at the very beginning; the largest group of people is young students from schools like the Joint Middle School. This group of people has a common feature in their thinking, that is, most of them come from landlord or rich peasant families, or at least well-to-do middle peasant families; on the one hand, they want to make progress and become revolutionary youths; on the other hand, they are tied to their families and cannot break free. We identified this characteristic of our organization's composition, so we focused the participation in the study on this group of people; primarily to help these comrades get out of the mire and embark on progress, rather than using our strength equally, so that many people are talked to one by one, and it takes half a month to finish, while those who are really eager to solve problems are neglected.

    　　　　III. Investigate Standpoint First, Then Learn Experience
    From analyzing readers' letters and from answering some questions reflected by comrades in our store, we know that this contains a general problem—the problem of different class standpoints; it cannot be effectively solved by explaining or answering each question individually in a head-pain-treat-head, foot-pain-treat-foot manner. Similarly, if the standpoint problem is not solved, that is, if the question of whether or not to approve of land reform itself is not resolved, then it is impossible to talk about work experience or learn work methods. Therefore, we did not start studying according to the prescribed documents from the beginning. We divided the work into two stages: the first stage was to investigate class standpoints first, and the second stage was to study work experience and so on. Here, we also did some prompting work: because no one would accept the direct suggestion that they were standing on a non-proletarian class standpoint; almost everyone would claim that their revolutionary standpoint was the most steadfast, and that others were wrong. Therefore, we did not ask people to declare their standpoints, but mainly to ask everyone to express their opinions on "Land Reform" or raise their own questions. Because the so-called standpoint is bound to be concretely expressed in these opinions, questions, and their presentation, it cannot be disguised at all. In addition, from various situations, we know that all opinions on "Land Reform" fall into three categories: one is whether or not the landlord class should be struggled against, the second is that the struggle seems to never end, and the third is that the struggle methods are too crude. Therefore, in the first stage, we also focused on this situation and proposed three key points, asking everyone to talk in detail. One is "Do you think that the entire landlord class or individual landlords, such as your family, should be struggled against or not?" The second is "Do you think that the struggle is thorough enough now?" The third is "What have you always thought revolution was for, and in your opinion, how should revolution be carried out?" Based on these three points, we asked everyone to talk in detail, and then distinguish from what they said, whose standpoint was what, so that even they themselves could only be surprised and unable to deny it. In this way, there was a basis for further study to transform standpoints. Our experience proves that doing so is good, and it is better than reading documents and talking about experience from the beginning, which makes the mind disagree with the books.

    　　　　IV. Full Democracy, Bold Exposure
    After the above three key points were proposed, we called for bold speech. Any doubts, any dissatisfaction; any criticisms of any policies, decrees, practices, anyone, even attacks on the Party, could be said. Because we fully demonstrated a democratic atmosphere and fully demonstrated genuine enthusiasm for caring for young comrades ideologically and politically, almost everyone told what had been hidden in their hearts for a long time. For example, one comrade said this: "I have always thought that the revolution is to carry out tender and affectionate education on the people of the world, but since the 'Land Reform,' what I have seen and heard is all hand-to-hand combat, all struggles on the line of life and death; seeing blood and seeing death. This has simply made me disappointed in the revolution! I simply can't sleep peacefully, always feeling that how can there still be this kind of phenomenon in the world we create?" Another comrade said: "It's simply terrible! Can we just let the crude peasants do whatever they want? Can they do whatever they want? How can this be put on the grand stage? How can this group of people, this set of practices, enter big cities? How can it be promoted to a larger situation? In a word, we are like mountain bandits, without any refined and dignified taste." For example, one comrade was presented with his own secret diary since "Land Reform," which was a most sincere confession of his feelings, a book of strategies to plan how to help his family escape the struggle, a collection of curses attacking the Party and the masses. In addition, a large group of comrades tried to reduce the class composition of their families as much as possible, always saying that they should not be struggled against at all, or that the struggle was too excessive; even some comrades said: "Landlords naturally lived that way in the past, there is no question of having committed any sins at all; today, if you want to take care of the masses, please ask them to give up something, why bother to insist that they are guilty and insist on struggling!" Such things can be said to have exposed almost all of these people's opinions on "Land Reform" this time.

    After such exposure, we then raised the question of investigating standpoints. We put forward the basic understanding that should be had of the revolution, we put forward that our class foundation relies on these "mountain bandits'" "mountain practices," and we put forward the masses' views on the questions they thought about. In short, we put forward a completely different way of saying the exact same questions from the revolutionary standpoint. At this point, everyone was surprised, stunned, and could only honestly admit that they were standing on the landlord class or some other class's standpoint, and asked everyone to help transform them; no one could pretend that they had always been correct and deceive themselves. By way of analogy, it is as if moving in a yard of furniture, and taking a picture, the true shape is revealed, and there is no way to escape or disguise. At the same time, because of the democratic enthusiasm, not only did it not frighten them, but also made each person feel that the gains for themselves were not small.

    　　　　V. Emphasize Thought, Incidentally Other Things
    Needless to say, these people were all acting as "air raid shelters" for the landlords, but as far as they were concerned, the ideological air raid shelter was far greater than the concrete air raid shelter for protecting people and protecting materials. Therefore, we again focused the study on transforming thoughts and changing standpoints. We believe that as long as the ideological problem is solved, the specific problems will be easily solved. Therefore, we conducted another mobilization, specifically pointing out that the issue of ideological standpoint was a matter of life and death for them! Either a revolutionary youth of the new society, or a wailing filial son of the old family; either advancing with the new era, or dying with the old class; either tomorrow, or yesterday; either the master of the revolution, or the defeated dog of the lost family, in short, whoever cannot pass this test is finished. This is the inevitability of history, and there is no need to attribute it to saying it is unkind. This also played a great role. In the diary of the above-mentioned comrade, when he recorded the most recent weeks, he also said this: "Danger! Danger! It won't work if I don't change!" On the other hand, some comrades who had hidden landlord materials were already reporting automatically, and it did not take much effort. We feel that except for those who have the flavor of struggle objects and should be sent away and liquidated by the masses, the focus of the study should be placed on ideology. We must not replace the complex and meticulous ideological transformation work with simple and crude investigations of wealth and other things.

    　　　　VI. "Think from Another Perspective"
    At the end of the first stage, we proposed such a learning method, called "Think from Another Perspective." Because everything looks completely different from a different class standpoint. This stage is not over yet. Here, I will just give some examples of the achievements that can be said to have been obtained: One comrade said this in the stage of exposing thoughts: "Although my family is a landlord, we have always participated in labor"; "My family has never done anything hegemonic"; "As soon as my hometown was liberated, I went back to mobilize them to be enlightened." But at this stage, he changed his perspective and changed his statement: "When I was a child at home, the adults told me to go to the field and said, 'If you don't work, can't you at least keep an eye on things!' It can be seen that our family's labor was just to keep an eye on the hired workers to be lazy"; "My family once filed a complaint and sent a peasant to his death in prison, so it can be seen that we are also a hegemonic type"; "I went back to persuade them to be enlightened as soon as my family was liberated, actually intending to take advantage of the fact that the mass movement had not yet risen, to cross out this debt hastily and escape the struggle." Another comrade said this in the exposure stage: "The punishment we have received exceeds the sins we have committed"; "My father is not that bad." But at this time, he was also able to say sincerely from the revolutionary standpoint: "My family is the ruler within a radius of thirty or forty miles": "After Lu Zhonglin came, my father was one of the main figures organizing Kuomintang activities; my father was also the leader of two secret societies in the village; my father organized the maintenance, which was not necessarily passive; my uncle and uncle were shot and injured, and my father even took out a package of poison for the masses, and my father is still alive now," and so on. Therefore, we believe that this method of prompting everyone to "think from another perspective" is more useful. We are still continuing this work. If we can completely change everyone's perspective and solve the problem of ideological standpoint, we plan to move to the second stage of learning work experience, methods, etc.

　　换一个看法想想
  　新华书店“土改”学习的点滴经验
    王春
    　　　　一、结合工作、结合群运
    新华书店的“土改”学习，最先是被工作的需要鞭策起来的。本来一般的机关工作者，尤其是文化工作者，最容易脱离现实，不管群众在干什么，我只伏案做我的事，外事不闻。但因为书上的通联科及“新大众”的编辑部，自从去年土地改革运动一开始，即不断收到读者上千封的来信；这些信有许多是假借一些问题攻击“土改”本身的，真心诚意质疑问难的很少。然而无论如何，有人来问，总得给人家以答复。在很长一个时期中，个别负责同志曾经为这种工作需要所推动，学习到一些道理。到了后来，“挖内货”来了，“割尾巴”也来了，于是诘问“土改”的信件更多了；今年有几个月，编辑部、通联科和读者的关系，几乎就形成以讨论“土改”中的问题为唯一中心的现象。这时候，工作的需要更压到头上来了，一般同志都感到非好好学习不可了。就由于这种学习与工作自自然然结合的很紧密的关系，在若干锻炼比较久的同志中间，能够早一点警悟到这是一个阶级立场问题，从而首先清查了自己的思想，获得比较明确的认识。这对后来开展“土改”学习，是有很大关系的。
    赵树理同志则特别注重驻村群众运动，在他的组织推动之下，书店王春同志等几个人和他共同成立了一个驻村工作组；从群众运动中的小组酝酿直到大会斗争，无不全过程的参加。后来更号召全体同志参加，替群众发现“防空”的麦子，帮群众维持会场秩序，给群众讲道理撑腰，回来座谈感想，比论道理。这一层对于在学习中举实例、比立场、启发思想、转化情绪等，都起了很大的作用，使得许多空谈“我对革命无意见”及死钻“我的家庭无剥削”等等的人，都自己感觉到有了考虑的余地。
    以上说明我们机关文化工作者，要想把“土改”学习进行得好，是非得设法把工作、学习、生活都与群运结合起来不可的。否则，拿我们来说，光写书，不管事，学这个，做那个，看斗争等于赶庙会，学起来还是空谈一通或者空辩一通，那必然会一无所成。
    　　　　二、区别成份、找出重点
    书店人员的成份，大体上可以分为三类：一类是几个锻炼较久的同志，这，我们组织了一个学习委员会，是在学习中起领导作用的；一类是几个混进来的斗争对象，这，我们一开头就让群众要回去了；最多的一批人，则是联中等学校出身的青年学生。这一批人在思想上有一个共同的特点，就是他们大部出身于地主富农至少也是富裕中农的家庭；他们一方面想进步，想当革命青年；一方面又牵连着家庭，拉不开腿。我们认定了我们机关成份的这个特点，所以把参加学习人员的重点放到这一批人身上；以真正帮助这些同志摆脱泥潭，走上进步为主；而不平均使用力量，弄得很多人数谈过一个谈一个，半个月还轮不完，而真正急着想解决问题的人却被冷落着。
    　　　　三、先查立场、后学经验
    我们从分析读者来信中，从解答本店同志所反映的一些问题中，知道这里边包含着一个总问题——阶级立场不同的问题；并非头疼医头、脚疼医脚式的逐一解释或具体回答所能奏效。同样，假使立场问题不解决，就是说假使对土地改革本身赞成不赞成的问题不解决，那是对于谈工作经验、学工作方法，也是一切都说不上的。因此我们一开始就没有按照规定的文件进行学习。我们把工作分为两个阶段：第一阶段先查阶级立场，第二阶段才来进行工作经验等等的学习。这里我们还做了一些提示要点的工作：因为正面提出说谁站的是非无产阶级立场，那是没有人会接受的；差不多每个人都会自称为革命立场最稳，而是旁人错了。因此我们是不要人声明立场，主要是要每个人都发表对“土改”的意见，或是提出自己的疑问。因为所谓立场，是必然具体表现在这些意见、疑问及其提法上边的，一点也伪装不来。另外，我们从种种情况中，知道所有对“土改”的意见，不外三类：一是对地主阶级该斗争不该斗争的问题，二是斗争好像就没个完的问题，三是斗争方式太粗暴的问题。因此我们在第一阶段也针对此种情况，提出三个要点，要大家详细来谈。一是“你觉着整个地主阶级或是个别地主例如你的家庭等该斗不该斗？”二是“你觉着现在能不能算是斗争已经彻底了？”三是“你一向以为革命是干什么的，而且照你的意见革命应该怎样干法？”根据这三点，要大家详细来谈，然后再从谈出的东西中间分别谁站的是什么立场，使得连他自己也只能吃惊，却无从否认。这样，对以后的进一步转变立场的学习，才有着落。我们的经验证明这样做是好的，这比一开头就来读文件、谈经验，弄得心思和书本上不对头，要好一些。
    　　　　四、充分民主、大胆暴露
    上述三个要点提出后，我们号召大胆说话。任何怀疑，任何不满；对任何政策法令，任何做法，任何人，一直到对党的攻击，都可以讲。由于我们充分表现了民主气氛，充分表现了真正的从思想上政治上爱护青年同志的热忱，大家差不多都说出了心里蕴藏已久的话。譬如一个同志是这么讲：我一向以为革命是对世界人进行温柔爱抚的教育的，然而自从“土改”以来，使我看到的听到的都是肉搏，都是生死线上的斗争；看到血，也看到了死。这使我对革命简直失望了！简直没法子睡个安心觉，总觉着我们创造的世界怎么还有这种现象？又一个同志说：简直糟得很！就能让粗野的农民想干什么就干什么吗？想怎么干就怎么干吗？这怎么登得大雅之堂？这批人，这套做法，如何进得大城市？如何向更大的局面推广得？一句话，我们象山大王，没点儒雅雍容的味道。又譬如一个同志被拿出了他自己“土改”以来的一部秘密日记，那是一本最真诚的心情自白，是一本想定计叫家庭逃脱斗争的谋略书，是攻击党攻击群众的咒骂集。此外一大批同志，则都尽量来降低自己家庭的成份，一直说根本不该斗，或是斗的太过火；甚至有的同志说：地主过去自自然然就是那么过日子，根本谈不上做过什么罪恶；今天想照顾群众，就请人家让出一点东西好了，何必要硬说是有罪，而且要硬斗！诸如此类，可以说这一次这些人把对“土改”的所有意见，暴露的差不多。
    经过这样暴露后，我们才来一下提出清查立场的问题。我们提出对革命应有的基本认识来，提出我们的阶级基础就靠的是这些“山大王”的“山做法”来，提出群众对他们所想那些问题的看法来。总之，提出站在革命的立场上，对那些完全相同的问题的完全不同的另外一种说法来。这一下，大家都吃惊了，楞住了，只有老老实实承认自己站的是地主阶级或什么其他阶级的立场，请大家帮同改造；再没有一个人得以混充他从来是正确的，自欺欺人。用比喻来说，好像搬来一院子家私，镜头一拍，原形毕显，一点也不得遁逃化装。而同时则由于民主热忱，不只没有吓回尾巴，还使各个人感到对自己的收获不小。
    　　　　五、着重思想、附带其它
    上述这批人，不用说都是替地主当“防空洞”的，不过就他们来说，思想上的防空洞远大于具体的掩护人掩护物资的防空洞。因此我们又把学习的重点放到改造思想、改变立场上。我们认为只要思想问题解决了，具体问题是不难迎刃而解的。因此我们又进行过一次动员，特别指明思想立场的问题，对他们竟然是生死关头的问题！或者是新社会的革命青年，或者是旧家庭的哭丧孝子；或是随着新时代前进，或是跟着旧阶级死去；或明天，或昨天；或是革命的主人翁，或是被斗的丧家犬，总而言之，谁过不了这一关，谁就完蛋。这是历史的必然，并用不着归咎于说不仁慈。这点也起了很大作用，就在上述那位同志的日记中，当他记到最近几星期的时候，也是这么说了：“危险！危险！不转变不成！”而另一方面，一些藏有地主物资的同志，却已在自动报告，并用不着花很大力气。我们觉着除了有斗争对象味道的人物根本就该送走，由群众向他清算外；一般都应该把学习重点放到思想上来的。我们不可把复杂细致的思想改造工作，用简单粗率的追究财宝等事情来代替。
    　　　　六、“换一个看法想想”
    我们在第一阶段的最后，提出这样个学习方法，叫做“换一个看法想想”。因为一切问题，换一个阶级立场来看，就会完全不同的。现在这一阶段还没有完。这里只把已经可说是取到的一些成绩，举点例子讲讲：有一个同志，在暴露思想阶段，是这样讲：“我家虽然是地主，但从来都是参加劳动的”；“我家从来没有做过恶霸的事情”；“我的家乡一解放，我就回去动员他们开明”。可是到了这一阶段，他换了个看法，说法就改变了：“我从小在家，大人叫我上地，说‘你就不干活，难道不能顶只眼！’可见我们家人的劳动，只是顶眼来监视雇工偷懒的”；“我家曾经打禀帖把一个农民送死在监里，可见也是恶霸一流”；“我家才解放就回去劝他们开明，实际是打算趁群运还没有起来的时候，钻个空子，草草勾掉这笔帐，脱逃斗争”。另外一个同志，在暴露阶段是这么讲：“我们所受的惩罚，超过所做的罪恶”；“我的父亲并没有那么坏”。可是这时候他也能站在革命的立场上真心诚意的讲了：“我家是方圆三四十里内外的统治者”：“鹿钟麟来到后，我父亲是组织国民党活动的主要人物之一；我父亲还是村里两个会门的领导者；我父亲组织维持，不见得就是被动的；我的伯、叔枪毙伤，我父亲还给群众拿出一包毒药来，而我父亲现在还活着”，诸如此类等等。因此我们认为这种提示大家“换个看法想想”的办法，是比较有用的。我们这种工作还在继续作，如果我们能由此完全把大家的看法换过来了，思想立场问题解决了，我们就打算转入第二阶段的工作经验方法等等的学习。
