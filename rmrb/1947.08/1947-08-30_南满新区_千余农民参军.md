Xinhua News Agency, Liaodong, 28th. In the newly recovered areas of Southern Manchuria, the masses, during the revenge and liberation movement, have sparked a surge of enthusiasm for joining the army. In Benxi and Panshi, over a thousand liberated youths have voluntarily joined the army recently. In Andong City and Gushan County, over three hundred youths have also signed up one after another. An old man from Xinbin County, Chen Xiangde, personally led his two sons and one grandson to the district government to sign up for the army, to defend the fruits of their liberation.

Xinhua News Agency, Northeast, 28th. In the southern section of the China Changchun Railway, Kuomintang and puppet troops are deserting in increasing numbers. In the Liaonan area alone, since July, there have been six instances of groups surrendering to the Democratic Allied Army with their weapons. In Benxi, the Kuomintang Northeast Sixth Security District, encompassing the 21st, 22nd, 23rd, and 24th Security Regiments, has seen its forces reduced by half due to desertions. According to soldiers who deserted, by the end of last month, the original four regiments could only be reorganized into two. Among them, the Third Battalion of the 24th Regiment, stationed in Niuxintai for five days, experienced over two hundred desertions.
