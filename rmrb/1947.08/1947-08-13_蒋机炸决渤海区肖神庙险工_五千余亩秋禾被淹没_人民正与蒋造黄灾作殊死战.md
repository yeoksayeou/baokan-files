Xinhua News Agency, Shandong, 11th: After the Xiao Shenmiao Yellow River embankment in Kenli County, Bohai Region, was breached by Chiang Kai-shek's planes, over 5,000 mu of autumn crops in seven villages, including Nanlingzi, Qilonghe, and Sanhezhuang, were completely inundated, affecting 540 households with 2,160 people. At 1:00 AM on the 7th, multiple American-made Chiang Kai-shek planes repeatedly bombed the riverbanks, with the residence of the Shandong Provincial River Affairs Bureau in Putai City becoming a concentrated target. Multiple heavy bombs were dropped, destroying 30 houses, killing five river defense personnel, including Cheng Ruhua, and injuring nine, including Gan Zhenhai. On the same night, three batches of Chiang Kai-shek planes repeatedly bombed dangerous sections of the embankment in Dama Village, Lijin County, and Daoxu, Putai County, not leaving until 10:00 AM the next morning. The democratic governments and the entire military and civilian population of counties along the river are using all their manpower and resources to fight a life-and-death battle against the Chiang-created disaster. Besides rescuing the wounded and comforting the disaster-stricken people, they are also making great efforts to repair the embankment. Dama Village embankment was repaired despite Chiang Kai-shek's air raids at night, consuming 200,000 catties of straw and 1,500 hemp ropes, and has now turned from danger to safety. Wangjiazhuang, Gongmenkou, Qijiazui, and other dangerous sections of the embankment have become stable after repairs. The dangerous sections of the embankment in Daliushudianzi, Zhangxindian, Pan Yangjia, and Changzhuang in Jiyang have been mostly repaired. To prevent a surge in the river, counties along the river are making further preparations for flood prevention. Putai has initiated a movement for each person to contribute over ten bricks to guarantee completion within five days. Yangzhong County plans to raise 5,000 cubic feet of bricks and a large number of cloth bags. Jiyang is preparing 100,000 catties of willow branches and 1,000 large piles for each dangerous section of the embankment, raising all embankment weirs two meters above the water surface.

Xinhua News Agency, Shandong, 11th: After the flood emergency at Xiao Shenmiao in Kenli (newly established county northeast of Lijin) in the Bohai Region, our military and civilians worked day and night to block the breach. Just as it was about to be closed, it was sabotaged and harassed by Chiang Kai-shek's planes and special agents, hindering the project and delaying the closure, turning large tracts of fertile land into swamps, causing severe disaster. The Yangzhong River defense team has arrested two Chiang Kai-shek special agents, Xiao Yushui and Ma Songben, who confessed that they were sent by Zhang Bulan, the Chiang Kai-shek special agent captain in Yangzhong, to infiltrate the liberated areas to sabotage the dikes and cooperate with Chiang Kai-shek's planes in bombing to create disaster.
