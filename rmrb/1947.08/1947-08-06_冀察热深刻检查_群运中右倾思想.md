Xinhua News Agency, Hebei-Chahar-Jehol, 3rd: The Hebei-Chahar-Jehol region is launching a top-down self-criticism campaign to address right-leaning ideologies in mobilizing the masses. After the land reform was carried out again this spring in the region, northeastern Chahar immediately launched an anti-"reverse settling of accounts" movement. The Pingbei Consolidated Area conducted a review of the land redistribution, and the border areas and the plain guerrilla areas carried out preliminary land redistribution and struggle sessions in conjunction with armed struggle. The guerrilla areas such as Baoyuan in northern Chahar also launched struggle sessions for settling scores and revenge. However, due to the fact that cadres at all levels did not dare to boldly let go and mobilize the masses, the situation failed to open up quickly. Recently, Niu Shushi, the District Party Committee Secretary of the CCP in the region, made a self-criticism of right-leaning ideologies in mobilizing the masses at a cadre meeting. The entire region then launched a deep self-criticism movement from top to bottom. In the expanded cadre meeting in Yihua (newly established county, western Miyun) and Luanping, it was revealed that the cadres' thinking contained the following errors: "Not afraid that peasants will not get land, but afraid that landlords will not live well; not afraid that peasants cannot rule, but afraid that landlords will escape; not afraid that peasants will not be emancipated, but afraid that landlords will be wronged; not afraid that a rural revolutionary order will not be established, but afraid that the feudal ruling order will be chaotic." After self-criticism, the CCP Chahar East Prefectural Committee unanimously resolved to move its position from the "Taishi chair" (referring to the landlord's position) back to the peasants' land. At this moment, the anti-"reverse settling of accounts" and the land reform movement of reviewing land redistribution are unfolding vigorously in Hebei-Chahar-Jehol region.

    冀察热深刻检查
    群运中右倾思想
    【新华社冀察热三日电】冀察热区自上而下展开检查在发动群众中的右倾思想。该区今春再次进行土地改革后，察东北即开展反“倒算”运动，平北巩固区进行清算复查，边沿区及平原游击区结合武装斗争初步进行清算、分田；察北宝源等游击地区也展开清算复仇斗争。但由于各级干部不敢大胆放手，以致局面未能很快打开。日前本区中共区党委牛树时，在干部会上检讨了发动群众中的右倾思想。全区就由上而下展开深刻的检查运动。乙化（新设县密云西部）滦平扩大干部会中，检讨出干部思想上存在着：“不怕农民得不到土地，反怕地主生活不好；不怕农民不能统治，反怕地主逃亡；不怕农民不翻身，反怕地主受委屈；不怕农村革命秩序不建立，反怕封建统治秩序混乱”等错误思想。中共察东地委会经检讨后，一致决心把立场从过去太师椅子（指地主）上搬回到农民土地上。刻冀察热全区反“倒算”及清算复查的土地改革运动，正轰轰烈烈全面展开中。
