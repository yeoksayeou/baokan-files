    Plowing Wheat Fields to Plant Autumn Vegetables, Hastening Seedling Weeding
    Fushan County-Wide Competition to Increase Production
    [This newspaper, Taiyue, 6th dispatch] Under the call of labor hero Shi Zhenming to "increase production and counterattack for grain," Fushan County has launched a large-scale production competition to weed seedlings, plow fields, and eliminate fallow land. The Old Second, Third, and Fifth Districts guarantee that autumn seedlings will be weeded three times, wheat fields will be plowed three times and harrowed four times, eliminating all fallow land in the villages, and striving for each household to plant one or two mu of late vegetables and late autumn crops. The Second District also specifically proposed to cultivate twelve heroes. In Zhuge Village, Fourth District, seven groups eliminated thirty mu of fallow land in one day. In Beichen Village, Third District, seventy-nine women organized sixteen mutual aid teams and rushed to weed 109.5 mu of seedlings in one and a half days. Even in the small village of Shayeli, with only three male full laborers, five female full laborers, and one cripple, totaling nine people from the Lian family, they also organized an all-inclusive mutual aid team to guarantee the plowing of more than one hundred mu of wheat fields in the entire village.
    [This newspaper reports] Labor hero Zhao Wenkui from Shangluoyu, Jingxing, challenged labor hero Du Aiguo from Gaojiayu Village in the district. After returning to the village, he mobilized the entire village at a general meeting and explained the benefits of weeding twice. Then, he convened a meeting of mutual aid team leaders and cadres and made a guarantee to complete the second weeding within five days. After going down to the fields, Zhao Wenkui first weeded his own land twice, leading his entire team and the villagers. In five days, they weeded 398 mu (including cotton). In particular, Zhao Wenkui's team completed the plan for the second weeding in four days. The entire village completed the plan in five days. The masses are very enthusiastic about the second weeding. A seventy-year-old liberated peasant said: "If it doesn't rain, we won't stop; take the small ones and fight!"
