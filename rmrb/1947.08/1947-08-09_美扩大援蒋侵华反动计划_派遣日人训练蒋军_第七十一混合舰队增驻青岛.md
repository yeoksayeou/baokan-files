Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 7th. U.S. imperialism's plan to cooperate with Japanese military experts in Taiwan to train Chiang's troops is actively underway. This plan was jointly agreed upon by Chiang Kai-shek, Marshall, and MacArthur in November of last year, stipulating that Japan would send a large number of officers to China to train the Kuomintang army. According to a Taiwan dispatch from the Hong Kong Hua Shang Pao, "The large-scale influx of Japanese into Taiwan has become an open secret." Statements by (Chiang) government and Kuomintang officials are sufficient to indirectly prove this fact. The Japanese arriving in Taiwan were secretly transported by U.S. military aircraft and destroyers in the past six months. Upon arrival in Taiwan, the Japanese wear U.S. military uniforms, carry weapons, and hold special passports issued by the U.S. military authorities, exempt from (Chiang) government jurisdiction. They include a large number of senior military experts and administrative personnel, with one estimate putting the number at three thousand, but the true figure remains secret. They are currently staying in hotels and will soon be moved to the Japanese residential area in Taipei, which was used during the former Japanese occupation of Taiwan. Taiwanese compatriots currently residing in this area have been notified that they must completely evacuate by the end of July. According to officials from the Taiwan Provincial Department of Agriculture and Forestry, forty-one Japanese sugar industry experts have arrived in Taiwan. According to this information, which is consistent with a French news agency report from Nanjing on the 30th of last month stating that the United States will train twenty divisions of Chiang's troops in Taiwan, the U.S. imperialists' preparation to train Chiang's troops in Taiwan has become an open secret. The Chiang government's recent appointment of Sun Li-jen, the only general who has studied in the United States, as commander of the Army Training Command of the Army Headquarters of the Chiang family's Ministry of National Defense, and Wedemeyer's upcoming "investigation" in Taiwan are all related to this U.S. imperialist aid-Chiang plan and aggression plan.

Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 6th. According to a Central News Agency report from Qingdao, the U.S. Navy's Seventy-First Mixed Fleet arrived in Qingdao on the 4th from Japan. Qingdao was originally stationed with the U.S. Seventh Fleet. The increase in U.S. fleet strength in Qingdao is clearly related to Wedemeyer's recent active activities in China to deploy Qingdao as a powerful U.S. naval base.

    美扩大援蒋侵华反动计划
    派遣日人训练蒋军
    第七十一混合舰队增驻青岛
    【新华社陕北七日电】美帝国主义准备在台湾与日本军事专家合作训练蒋军计划，正积极进行中。该计划为蒋介石于去年十一月与马歇尔、麦克阿瑟共同商定者，计划中规定由日本派遣大量军官来华训练国民党军队。据香港华商报台湾通讯称：日人大量移入台湾已成公开秘密，（蒋）政府及国民党官员的声明，均足以间接证明此一事实。来台日人系在过去六个月内由美国军用飞机及驱逐舰秘密运送者。抵台日人均穿美军制服，腰悬武器，持有美军事当局特别护照，不受（蒋）政府管辖。其中包括大量高级军事专家及行政人员，人数一说为三千，但真实数字仍属秘密。现均住旅馆中，不久将移往前日寇统治台湾时代之台北日人住宅区，现居住此区域内之台胞已接获通知，须于七月底以前完全撤离。据台省农林局若干官员证实，日本四十一名糖业专家已抵台湾。按照此讯与法国新闻社上月三十日南京电称美国将在台湾训练蒋军二十个师一讯一致，美帝国主义者准备在台湾训练蒋军已成公开秘密，蒋政府日前任命唯一曾留美的将领孙立人兼任蒋家国防部陆军总司令部陆军训练司令，及魏德迈之将赴台湾“调查”，均与美帝国主义此一援蒋计划及侵略计划有关。
    【新华社陕北六日电】据中央社青岛消息，美海军第七十一混合舰队于四日由日本驶抵青岛。按青岛原驻有美国第七舰队。美国在青舰队力量之增加，显与最近魏德迈在华积极活动将青岛布置为美海军强大基地有关。
