Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 30th. Wedemeyer flew back to Nanjing from Shanghai on the 28th. After arriving in Shanghai on the 26th, Wedemeyer met separately with representatives of American businesses, naval officers, Chennault of the "Flying Tigers" who engaged in aerial aggression against China, and Zhang Junmai and Li Huang of the Chinese political beggar Minsha Party and Youth Party, respectively. According to a Shanghai dispatch from the Associated Press on the 27th, "Wedemeyer is preparing to visit Peiping, Shenyang, and Taiwan after returning to Nanjing... When he returns from Taiwan, he will use Nanjing as a base to visit Western China first." It is generally believed that Wedemeyer's planned "visits" to North China and Northeast China show that the American imperialists are very anxious about the military setbacks of their running dog Chiang Kai-shek. His preparation to go to Taiwan and Sichuan is believed to be related to Chiang Kai-shek's plan to sell Taipei, Keelung, Chengdu and other places to the United States as military bases. It is reported that since Wedemeyer arrived in China, Chiang Kai-shek's small court, which was in the third stage of syphilis, has been inspired by the Wedemeyer mission. The general mood of depression has turned into excitement. According to an Associated Press dispatch on the 27th: "The dejected Ministry of National Defense officers are busy preparing new plans to defeat the Communist army." "There have been significant changes in various agencies of the Nanjing government. The lazy style has disappeared in the rush to collect information for the Wedemeyer mission." However, according to the Associated Press, "If Wedemeyer's visit fails to produce the large amount of aid expected, it is difficult to say how serious the old disease will relapse in the end."

    魏德迈开始巡视蒋管区
    【新华社陕北三十日电】魏德迈已于二十八日由沪飞返南京。魏于二十六日飞抵上海后，曾分别接见美商代表、海军军官与对中国从事空中侵略的“飞虎”陈纳德，以及中国政治乞丐民社党张君劢、青年党李璜等人。据合众社二十七日沪电称：“魏德迈返京后准备到北平、沈阳、台湾一行，……当他自台湾归来时，即以南京为基地首先访问华西。”一般认为魏准备“访问”华北与东北，显示美帝国主义者对其走狗蒋介石的军事失利十分着急、其准备到台湾去四川、则被认为与蒋介石拟出卖台北、基隆、成都等地给美国作军事基地一项计划有关。据悉：自魏德迈抵华后，到了梅毒第三期的蒋介石小朝廷均受魏德迈使团的激励，普遍的沮丧情绪，已一变为兴奋，据二十七日美联社电：“垂头丧气的国防部军官们，正忙于制作新的击败共军计划。”“南京政府各机关，已有显著变化了，懒散的作风，已消失于收集资料供给魏德迈使团的忙碌中。”但据美联社称：“假如魏德迈之访问未能产生如所期望的大量援助的话，则老病到底会复发到何种严重程度，那就很难说了。”
