    Snippets from the Chiang Kai-shek Controlled Areas
    ◇ Chiang Kai-shek is intensifying news censorship in various regions. The words "part omitted" and "omitted" frequently appear in newspapers as euphemisms for censored content. For example, in early July, the Tianjin Ta Kung Pao published a New York dispatch titled "An Interview with Mr. Wallace." The section on "the China issue" concerning politics and military affairs was completely censored, leaving only a small portion of Wallace's discussion of China's agriculture and industry.
    ◇ In early July, the Chongqing Business Daily was ordered to cease publication for one day by the Chiang government for publishing grain price quotations. Forbidding the "Business" Daily from publishing business information sets an unprecedented example in history, demonstrating the severity of the grain shortage and soaring grain prices in Chongqing.
    ◇ In the Northeast Chiang-occupied areas, people are treated as criminals for eating rice. Chiang Kai-shek's headquarters issued an order that rice would be used exclusively for military purposes and not allowed for civilian consumption. Those who conceal rice or fail to surrender it completely at the "official price" (which is several times lower than the market price) to the Chiang government will be deemed to have "aided the enemy" and will be subject to confiscation and "severe punishment without leniency."

    蒋区零讯
    ◇蒋介石加紧对各地之新闻检查，各报上已经常出现“中略”、“被略”的被删检代名词。天津大公报上月初刊载纽约通讯“访问华莱士先生”一文，其中“中国问题”有关政治、军事的一段全部被检，只留下华莱士谈中国农工业的一小般。
    ◇重庆商务日报上月初因刊载粮价行情，被蒋政府勒令停刊一天。“商务”日报而不准刊载商情，开了古今中外先例，重庆粮荒及粮价暴涨之严重性，于此可以想见。
    ◇东北蒋占区人民吃大米即被作为犯罪。蒋家行辕通令，大米一律作为军用，不准作为民食，如藏匿不报或不全部按“公定价格”（与市价相差数倍）呈缴蒋政府者，即认为有“资敌行动”，除没收外，还要“严惩不贷”。
