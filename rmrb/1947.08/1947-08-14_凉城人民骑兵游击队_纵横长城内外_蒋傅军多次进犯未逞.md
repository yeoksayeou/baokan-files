　　Liangcheng People's Cavalry Guerrilla Force
  　Sweeping Across the Great Wall
  　Chiang and Fu's Armies Repeatedly Invaded Without Success
    [Xinhua News Agency, Jin-Sui, 12th] The People's Guerrilla Force is active on the Great Wall line bordering the Jin and Sui provinces, surrounding the isolated strongholds of Chiang and Fu's armies. The Feng-Liang Guerrilla Force, formed by the people of Fengzhen and Liangcheng last September, has now grown into a strong cavalry unit. Relying on the winding and continuous Great Wall and mountainous areas, it gallops across the vast areas between Fengzhen, Liangcheng, Zuoyun, Youyu, and Datong. Fu's army has repeatedly gathered its forces, establishing strongholds step by step to encircle and suppress them, but has never succeeded. The northern and southern ends of the mountainous area are plains, allowing the guerrillas to move freely and achieve unexpected victories, causing Fu's army to suffer defeats each time. In early June, Fu's army used its usual tactic of oppressing the people in its controlled areas, forcibly demanding six able-bodied men and three women from each Bao in the mountainous area, ordering them to be handed over within six days. Two six-day periods passed, and the masses still ignored them. Fu's army then sent troops to press for compliance, but the brave People's Cavalry suddenly appeared, routing Fu's army. On the 22nd of last month, the guerrillas again raided Huangtukou north of Zuoyun, annihilating 90 members of the grain-robbing Fu army's Bao security brigade, with the guerrillas suffering only one casualty and one wounded. In June and July, the People's Armed Work Team squeezed Fu's army from south to north between Zuoyun and Youyu. Hearing the news, the Chiang-controlled district and township offices in the suburbs of Zuoyun fled into the city in panic, while the Armed Work Team successively recovered 39 villages in the suburbs of Youyu. The masses around Qingshuihe have now strengthened their self-defense organizations, increased their confidence in the struggle against the enemy, and smoothly launched land reform.
    [Xinhua News Agency, Jin-Sui, 12th] The Jin-Sui Military Region Command has recently issued an operational communique for July, stating that the operational characteristics of July were anti-grain grabbing struggles, and the focus of the war was still in the Jinzhong Plain. The People's Liberation Army's local corps and militia guerrillas fought a total of 87 battles, annihilating 3,476 enemies, including the capture of the 216th Regiment of the 72nd Division of the Yan army, with commander Qiu Ru＠, deputy commander Zhang Su, and 2,026 other soldiers. Approximately 500 Shi of grain and 1,000 heads of livestock seized by the Yan and Fu armies were recovered and immediately returned to the masses. The main seized items included one mountain gun, six infantry guns and mortars, 56 small guns and grenade launchers, 136 light and heavy machine guns, 1,226 long and short guns, and nine hand grenade launchers. According to reports, the Yan army mobilized all its forces to seize wheat in July, concentrating 27 regiments along the WenShui, Fenyang, and Jiaocheng line, with the serial numbers of 11 divisions already identified (the Yan army currently has 15 division serial numbers). Yang Aiyuan, deputy director of the Chiang-controlled Taiyuan Pacification Headquarters, Zhao Chengshou, commander-in-chief of the army group, and even all the army commanders participated in the burning, killing, looting, and atrocities that surpassed the Japanese invaders' Three Alls Policy. With the close cooperation of the military and civilians in the liberated areas, the entire regiment of the Yan army's 72nd Division was annihilated on July 4th, and many strongholds such as Luocheng town north of Fenyang city and Zili in Wenshui city were successively captured on the 21st and 22nd.

  　蒋傅军多次进犯未逞
    【新华社晋绥十二日电】人民游击队活跃晋绥两省交界的长城线上，团团围困蒋傅军的孤立据点。去年九月由丰镇、凉城人民所组成的丰、凉游击队，现已壮大为一支骑兵劲旅，以蜿蜒亘绵的长城及山区为依托，驰骋于丰镇、凉城、左云、右玉、大同之间的广大地区。傅军曾多次集结兵力，步步按扎据点进剿，皆未得逞，山区南北两端均为平川，游击队纵横自如，出奇制胜，傅军每次受创败北。六月初，傅军以在其统治区压榨人民的惯技，向山区群众每保强索壮丁六名，女子三名，限令于六日内交结。两个六天过去了，群众仍毫不理睬，傅军乃派兵催逼，不意人民骑兵健儿突然出现，打得傅军抱头鼠窜。上月廿二日，游击队复奔袭左云以北黄土口，歼灭抢粮傅军保警大队九十人，游击队仅伤亡各一人。六、七两月内，人民武工队在左云、右玉间，从南向北挤压傅军。左云城郊蒋记区乡公所闻风惊窜城内，武工队接连在右玉城郊收复村庄三十九处。清水河周围群众现已加强自卫组织，提高对敌斗争信心，顺利展开土地改革。
    【新华社晋绥十二日电】晋绥军区司令部顷发表七月份作战公报称：七月份作战特点为反抢粮斗争，战事重心仍在晋中平川。解放军地方兵团及民兵游击队共作战八十七次，歼敌三千四百七十六人，内生俘阎军七十二师二一六团，正副团长邱如＠、张苏以下二千零二十六人，夺回被阎、傅军抢走之粮食约五百石，牲畜一千头，当即发还群众。主要缴获品有山炮一门，步兵炮及迫击炮六门，小炮及掷弹筒五十六个，轻重机枪一百三十六挺，长短枪一千二百二十六支，手榴弹发弹筒九个。按七月间阎军抢麦，倾巢出动，文水、汾阳交城一线共集中兵力二十七个团，已发现十一个师的番号（阎军现共有十五个师番号），蒋记太原绥署副主任杨爱源、集团军总司令赵承绶，以至各军长全部参与，烧杀抢掠，惨暴比日寇之三光政策有过之而无不及。解放区军民在密切配合下，曾于七月四日首歼阎军七二师一个整团，二十一、二两日连克汾阳城北之罗城镇及文水城之蒺藜等据点多处。
