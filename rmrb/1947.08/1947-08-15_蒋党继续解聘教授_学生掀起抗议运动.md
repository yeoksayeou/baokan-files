Xinhua News Agency, Central Hebei, 13th—As universities in the Chiang-controlled areas are about to begin their semesters, the Chiang government continues its illegal dismissal of a large number of upright and knowledgeable professors from various schools. According to news from the Tianjin Daily, simultaneously with Shanghai Jinan University dismissing 46 professors, Kaifeng's Henan University also illegally dismissed more than 30 professors, including Chen Zhongfan, the head of the Department of Education; Wang Yizhai, a professor in the Department of Economics; Ma Jiwu, a professor in the Department of Literature and History; and Duan Zaopei, a professor at the Surveying School. The "reasons" for the dismissal were "having served as representatives to Beijing to appeal for improved treatment" and "being upright and outspoken." The dismissal letters even openly stated, "Following instructions from the Central Government (Chiang's petty court), due to suspicion of a certain important incident, the individual should be dismissed." Nanjing Central University also suspended the employment of Wu Zuxiang, a professor in the Department of Chinese Language and Literature, among others. The issue of dismissing professors in universities in Beiping, Tianjin, and Shanghai is still being planned for the future. This is an indication that the Chiang government, since issuing the anti-revolutionary general mobilization order, is determined to completely deprive education and academic freedom. Even the Tianjin Ta Kung Pao, which supports Chiang Kai-shek, could not help but admit in its editorial on the 25th of last month that this indicated "no guarantee of academic freedom whatsoever." Professors at universities across the country feel extremely indignant about this. Students at various universities are launching protests against the illegal dismissal of professors. Student self-governing associations at Shanghai Jinan University and Nanjing Central University have successively lodged protests with the Chiang government.

　　蒋党继续解聘教授
  　学生掀起抗议运动
    【新华社冀中十三日电】蒋管区各大学行将开学之际，蒋政府继在各校非法解聘大批正直而有学问的教授。据津报消息，与上海暨南大学解聘教授四十六人的同时，开封河南大学亦非法解聘教授三十余人，包括教育系主任陈仲凡、经济系教授王毅斋、文史系教授马辑五、测量学校教授段栽培，解聘之“理由”为“曾充代表赴京呼吁改善待遇”、“正直敢言”，其解聘书上，甚至竟公然书明“奉中央（蒋家小朝廷）指示，因某重要事件可疑，应予解聘”等字样。南京中央大学亦停聘中文系教授吴组湘等。平、津、沪各大学解聘教授问题，还继续在以后酝酿中。此为蒋政府自颁布反革命总动员令后，决心全部剥夺教育学术自由之表示。甚至拥护蒋介石的天津大公报，在上月二十五日社论中亦不能不承认此表示“还术自由，实在毫无保障”。各地大学教授对此至感愤激。各大学学生则正掀起对非法解聘教授之抗议，上海暨大与南京中大学生自治会已先后向蒋政府提出抗议。
