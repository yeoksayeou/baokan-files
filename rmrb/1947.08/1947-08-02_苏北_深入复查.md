    Northern Jiangsu
    In-depth Re-investigation
    (Xinhua News Agency, Central China, 28th) Northern Jiangsu is once again deeply carrying out re-investigation. The Northern Jiangsu District Committee of the Chinese Communist Party, at an enlarged meeting held from the 8th to the 16th of this month, clearly decided that in the future it must implement the land reform re-investigation policy of boldly mobilizing the masses, thoroughly eliminating feudal remnants, and satisfying the land requirements of hired and poor peasants (including quantity and quality). The land reform in Northern Jiangsu began in July of last year and was largely completed in September. In the Yancheng-Funing area alone, more than 2 million peasants were allocated over 3.4 million mu of land. However, in some areas, there was a tendency towards a rich peasant line, and genuinely poor and hired peasants have not yet completely turned over. A re-investigation was conducted once in March and April of this year to eliminate the phenomenon of "half-baked" reforms, but it still failed to be fully implemented, so it was decided to conduct another in-depth re-investigation.

    苏北
    深入复查
    【新华社华中二十八日电】苏北再度深入开展复查。中共苏北区党委，在本月八日至十六日举行的扩大会议上，明确决定今后必须贯彻放手发动群众，彻底肃清封建残余，满足雇贫农土地要求（包括数量与质量）的土地改革复查方针。按苏北土地改革，开始于去年七月、九月大部结束。盐阜区小个县即有二百余万农民分得田三百四十余万亩。但部分地区存在富农路线倾向，真正贫雇农尚未彻底翻身。今春三、四月间会一度进行复查，消灭“夹生”现象，但仍未能贯彻，乃决定再深入复查。
