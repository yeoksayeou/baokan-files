    Production and Savings Campaign in Chuandi
    Lin Hua
    San Mao
    Under the active leadership of labor hero Guo Yu'en, Chuandi Village in Pingshun is engaged in both production and rigorous saving. Significant achievements have already been made, and the details are reported below:
    
    Saving One Stone and One Dou a Day
    In recent years, due to organized production, the entire village has generally achieved a "three parts cultivation, one part surplus" situation, and every household has surplus grain. The standard of living has doubled compared to before the war. The general lifestyle is: yellow *ge da* [likely a local food, untranslated] with vegetables in the morning, rice or thick porridge with vegetables at noon, and mixed grain rice with salt in the afternoon. This is just everyday food. As for eating pancakes, baked bread, yellow steamed bread or noodles and other varied foods, it can be seen constantly. Such a life requires one *jin* of coarse grain per person per day, and the whole village needs more than three *shi* of grain a day. The life after saving is: half-and-half *ge da* with no vegetables in the morning, thin porridge with wild vegetables at noon, and if it is rice, it is just rice soup, no vegetables or noodles, and saltless vegetable soup at night; about half of the households in the village (more than forty households) have prepared bran-fried noodles, which can be mixed with even more bran than *ge da*. This standard of living is not lower than before the war, but the whole village can save one *shi* and one *dou* of coarse grain every day, enough for four days in three days.
    
    New Customs After Saving
    In the past, weddings and funerals were a big expense. The most popular old saying in this village is "three no pains" (not painful about money), that is, not painful about funerals for parents, not painful about weddings for daughters, and not painful about full-month celebrations for children. As An Tai said, "In the past, a person's death would require half of the family property." After saving, new customs have been established, and the masses feel that it saves money and trouble. For example, after Guo Fujing's daughter died, she was buried the same day with the help of the mutual aid group, eating only one *dou* of rice porridge and using three *chi* of white cloth. In the past, it would have taken three days to bury the body, and also require inviting a geomancer, thanking the earth god, looking at the *feng shui*, hiring earthworkers, and the family members would have to wear mourning clothes. According to Fujing's calculation, the new customs save two *shi* and nine *dou* of rice and nine *zhang* and seven *chi* of cloth compared with the old customs, and this does not include lost wages. For example, Liu Guicheng held a simple wedding and only ate one *dou* of wheat and three *sheng* of rice. In the past, it would have required four *shi* of fine grains. The above are only calculations for two households. In addition, the whole village has also cancelled the old custom of "going summer" this year, saving two *shi* of wheat.

    The Drier it Is, the More We Must Produce
    Labor hero Guo Yu'en called out: "The drier it is, the more we must produce." The whole village took action under this call. First, canals were repaired, a total of eighteen large canals and ninety-one small canals. More than 300 *mu* of flat land can be used, and wherever water can be used or land can be irrigated, even a little bit, it will not be let go. For example, Guo Dejiao said: "It is said that drought irrigates the mountains and floods irrigate the plains, but this year I will make drought irrigate the plains." So he built canals on every piece of his land, and even the smallest streams were not let go. On a three *li* piece of land on the eastern slope, he built a three *chi* long canal. Land that had never been irrigated before can now use water conservancy. There are more than thirty small canals in the village. The completion of the canals guarantees half of the total harvest. Yu'en said: "Even if the slopes don't produce a single grain, this irrigated land will be enough to drink vegetable soup next year."
    
    Topdressing is Drought-Resistant and Sprouts
    The whole village applied topdressing to 71.1 *mu* of land, a total of 852 *dan* of manure. All the Golden Queen corn was topdressed. Guo Biaoshui applied 50 *dan* of night soil to his three *mu* of corn, saying: People don't treat the land badly, and the land won't treat people badly. When people are full, they have strength, and when crops are full, they also have strength (drought resistance). Even if it doesn't rain, as long as the work is done, it can withstand half of the rain. Because of the topdressing, the crops are drought-resistant. When you go to the fields at noon, you can see that the leaves that have been topdressed are expanded and dark in color, while the other leaves are curled. The masses said: "Topdressing is drought-resistant and sprouts." The whole village not only applied topdressing, but also did not relax on intensive cultivation, thus ensuring that this year's harvest will not be greatly reduced. At present, all 620 *mu* of land in the village have been weeded twice, 75 *mu* of Golden Queen corn have been weeded three times, and cotton has been hoed for the fifth time.

    Wild Vegetables are Exchanged Now, Planting Vegetables Takes Care of the Whole Year
    The day after the district committee's call, the men went all out to hoe the land for the second time, and the women and children were all mobilized to pick wild vegetables. After ten days of statistics, in addition to what was eaten, 15,100 *jin* of wild vegetables were dried. Wild vegetables were piled up everywhere in mats, jars, baskets, on *kangs*, and upstairs. Because wild vegetables played a big role in 1943, everyone had experience. However, wild vegetables are not as good as vegetables in the fields. Biaoshui said: "Wild vegetables can only be exchanged now, taking care of the present, and planting vegetables can take care of the whole year." Shitou also said: "If you dig this time, you won't be able to carry two *dan* after autumn." So the whole village rushed to plant vegetables when the second weeding was about to end. Because of the drought, a small number of people were unwilling to plant, but after accounting and persuading them, they all started planting. The whole village has planted more than 60 *mu* of vegetables, and it is estimated that at least 25,000 *jin* of vegetables can be harvested. These vegetable fields were not valued in previous years, but this year they are valued and cultivated like good land. For example, a slope of less than two *li* on the back of Erquan Liu is also planted with vegetables, and vegetables are also planted on the edge of the field and in the corners of the yard.

    Spinning 170 Jin of Cotton in Ten Days
    The women are very active in saving and production. They try their best not to leave any food left over every day, and if there is any leftover, they put it in the next meal. In the past, it would have been fed to pigs or livestock, but now it is different. In addition, they also save time. In the past, women did not eat when men ate, and waited for the men to finish eating before the women ate. After eating, washing the pots and bowls would take a long time. Now they eat at the same time, and wash the pot as soon as they put down the bowl, which can save a lot of time for production, especially in spinning. In order to save oil, they try to spin during the day, and if there is a moon at night, they spin a little, and if there is no moon, they go to bed early and get up early, which can also catch up with work. From April 1st (lunar calendar) to June 6th, within sixty days, the 73 spinning women in the village spun a total of 805 *jin* of cotton. After the district committee called for saving and production, 43 women spun 170 *jin* of cotton in ten days. Now they have set out a plan to spin 110 *jin* in ten days. In addition to spinning, they also dig wild vegetables, both for people to eat and to feed pigs, saving bran and grain. For example, the Yinze team used to need five *dou* of grain a day to feed pigs, but now it has been reduced to one *dou* (38 pigs of all sizes), and they are still feeding them very well.

    川底的生产节约运动
    林华
    三毛
    平顺川底村在劳动英雄郭玉恩积极领导之下，一面从事生产，一面厉行节约。现已作出很大成绩，兹将其详情报导于下：
    一天节省一石一
    几年来由于组织起来生产，全村已普遍达到了耕三余一，家家户户都有了余粮。生活程度较之战前提高了一倍。一般的生活是：早晨黄圪＠有菜，晌午捞饭或稠饭有菜，下午是调和饭有盐。这只是家常便饭，至于吃顿煎饼，烙饼，黄蒸或面等变样饭，更是不断的能看到。这样的生活每天每人需粗粮一斤，全村一天需粮三石多。节约后的生活是：早晨对半掺的圪＠无菜，晌午稀稠饭配野菜，如果是捞饭就光是饭汤，没有菜也没有面，黑夜菜汤无盐；全村约有一半的户数（四十余户）都准备了糠炒面，这比糠圪＠还能多掺糠，这样的生活水平，较之战前还不低，可是每天全村能节省一石一斗粗粮，三天就够四天用。
    节约后的新风气
    过去的婚、丧大事是一笔很大的开支，这村最流行的一句古话是“三不痛”（不痛钱），即丧葬父母不痛，结婚嫁女不痛，小儿作满月不痛。如安太说：“要是过去死个人就得半分家业”。节约后却树立起新风气，群众也感到既省钱又省事。比如郭富景的女儿死了之后，当天在互助组协助下就埋掉了，先后吃了一斗米的稠饭，用了白布三尺。如是过去，需过三天才能下葬，并且还得请阴阳，谢土，看风水，请土工，家族都得穿孝。据富景一户的计算，新风俗比旧风俗省米两石九斗，布九丈七尺，这还未计算误工工资。又如刘贵成结婚举行了简朴婚礼之后，才吃了一斗麦子三升米，如在过去就需细粮四石，以上仅是两户的计算。除此全村今年将走夏的旧俗也取消了，省麦子两石。
    越旱越要生产
    劳英郭玉恩号召：“越旱越要生产”。全村就在这一号召下行动起来了。首先是修渠，共修了大渠十八道，小渠九十一道。三百余亩平地都能用到，凡是能利用的水道或是能浇到的地，那怕是一点点，也不放松过去。如郭得蛟说：“都说是旱浇山涝浇川，今年我非叫他旱浇川不行”，于是在他每块土地上都修了水渠，那怕是极小的水流也不放过去。他东坡根的一块地，只有三厘大的一片，就修了三尺长的一道水渠，从未浇过的地，现在也能利用上水利了。全村小水渠有三十道之多。由于水渠的修成，保证了全部收获量的一半。玉恩说：“就是垛地不打一棵粮食，光这过水地也够明年喝菜汤了”。
    追肥耐旱也发苗
    全村共上追肥的地七十一亩一分，共粪八百五十二担，所有的金皇后都上到了。郭表水三亩玉茭就上了五十担圊，他说：人不亏地不亏人，人吃饱了有劲，庄稼吃饱也有劲（耐旱），虽说天不下雨，只要作造到了也能顶一半雨。由于上了追肥，庄稼就是耐旱了，晌午到地里看一看，凡是上过追肥的叶子展，颜色发黑，其他的叶子就卷了边了。群众说：“追肥就是耐旱也发苗”。全村不光上了追肥，就是在精耕细作上也不放松，因此也保证了今年收获决不会大减。现在全村六百二十亩地，完全锄过了两遍，七十五亩金皇后已锄够三遍，棉花已上了第五锄。
    野菜现兑现，种菜顾全年
    当区委号召的第二天，男人们以全力突击锄二遍地，妇女和儿童就全部动员起来去采野菜了。十天头上统计了一下，除吃掉了的还晒了野菜一万五千一百斤，席圈里、缸里、篓子里、炕上、楼上到处堆的都是野菜，因为野菜在四三年曾起了很大作用，大家都有了经验，但是野菜究竟不如地里菜好，表水说：“野菜只能现兑现，顾个眼前，种菜还是能顾全年”。石头也说：“这会将刨刨，秋后两担担不了”。于是全村在拉二遍将结束，就突击种菜。由于地旱，一小部分人不愿种，经算帐说服动员后，都种开了。全村已种菜六十余亩，估计最少能收菜二万五千斤，这些菜地，在往年都是不为人所重视的，而今年却和好地一样的被重视和作造了，如二全柳泉背上不足二厘的一块坡地，也种上了菜，另外在场边、院角都种的是菜。
    十天纺花一百七十斤
    妇女们节约生产都很积极，每天作的饭尽量不叫剩下，如稍有剩余就放在下顿吃了，要在过去不是喂了猪就是喂了牲口，现在不同了，另外也很节约省时间，过去是男人吃饭时女人不吃，等男人吃罢女人才吃，吃完再洗洗锅碗就要占很长时间。现在是同时吃，放下碗就洗锅，这样能省出许多时间来进行生产，尤其在纺织上抓的更紧，为了省油就尽量在白天纺，黑夜有月亮就纺一小回，没有月亮就早点睡了早点起，也能赶出活来。从四月一（阴）到六月初六十天内，全村七十三个纺妇共纺花八百零五斤，而在区委号召节约生产之后，十天四十三个妇女纺花一百七十斤，现又订出计划，十天要纺一百一十斤。除了纺织还要挖野菜，一面供人吃，一面喂猪，糠粮都省下了。如银则组过去喂猪每天需粮五斗，现在已减低到一斗了（大小三十八只），并且喂的还很好。
