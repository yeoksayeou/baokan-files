　　Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 22nd – “Since the (Jiang) government troops occupied Huaiyin, the answer given to the common people has been one of despair.” This is the tearful accusation of Shi Benliu, a citizen of Huaiyin, in the "Reader's Voice" column of the Nanjing Jiang family's "National Salvation Daily" on July 6th, and can be said to be a summary of the tyranny of the Jiang army during the ten months of its occupation of Huaiyin. In this "Reader's Voice," it is pointed out that under the Jiang army's trampling, "the atmosphere of corruption is becoming more and more serious in Huaiyin. Although the county, township, and Bao-Jia chiefs have been transferred several times, they are just the same old wine in new bottles. Their corruption and extortion have not only not been eliminated but have intensified. The local despots and evil gentry are still there, lording it over the people and oppressing the citizens. Whether they are heads of institutions or 'people's representatives' (?), they are fighting for profit and seizing power every day. Prices cannot be suppressed, and the lives of the citizens are unsustainable. The number of conscripts is too high, and agriculture is being abandoned. Fighting a civil war as a soldier is something we are unwilling to do."

　　淮阴市民控诉蒋党蒋军暴政
    【新华社陕北二十二日电】“自（蒋）政府军占领淮阴后，所给老百姓的答复是一个绝望。”这是淮阴市民施本柳在七月六日南京蒋家“救国日报”读者呼声栏的血泪控诉，也可以说是淮阴市民对蒋军侵占淮阴十月来暴政的总结。在该读者呼声中，指出蒋军蹂躏下的淮阴，“贪污风气日重，县、乡保甲长虽均数度调动，但都换汤不换药，他们的贪污、勒索，不但没有消灭反而加厉。地方上的土豪劣绅，还在那里作威作福欺压市民，他们不管做机关首长也好，做民意（？）代表也好，天天是无利不争，无权不夺。物价无法抑止，市民生活无着。征兵数额过多，农荒废。打内战当兵，这是我们所不愿意干的。”
