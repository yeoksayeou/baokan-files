　　Wucheng Inspects the Reasons for Incomplete Land Reform
  　Liquidating Right-leaning Leadership Thought
    [Reported from Jinnan on the 25th by our newspaper] An inspection in Wucheng revealed that the land reform movement of last winter and this spring was still a "half-cooked meal." Most of the floating assets were untouched, and 70% of the landlords still maintained a landlord lifestyle. From a political perspective, the landlords were not brought to their knees through struggle, and they constantly attacked the masses, using money and beautiful women to buy off cadres and activists, or feigning enthusiasm to resist, thereby trying to win over military families and sow discord between cadres and the masses. When poor peasants borrowed things from them, they made sarcastic remarks: "You've turned over, yet you still borrow things from me?" Furthermore, they concealed their original forms, dismissing tenants and hiring short-term laborers, dividing their families, lowering their class status, or infiltrating various organizations to secretly control power. According to statistics from 68 villages, among the 975 village cadres, two or three were landlords, 27 were rich peasants, 446 were middle peasants, and only 479 were poor peasants. Because the landlords were not eliminated and the demands of the poor were not met, the poor peasants said: "Even after turning over, we still have to borrow from them (referring to the landlords)!" The inspection found that the main reason for the incomplete reform was the right-leaning ideology of the leadership, drawing circles and stipulating that landlords should be left with a livelihood, overemphasizing care for landlord military families. Therefore, when the poor peasants demanded that the landlords be swept out the door, we did not approve it. In addition, we failed to establish poor peasant backbones, with middle peasants accounting for half of those in power, hence the struggle was incomplete.
    [Reported from Jinnan on the 25th by our newspaper] Hao Village in the Third District of Jing County, with 73 households, is divided into three clans: Qian Liu, Hou Liu, and Dong Hao. Hou Liu, led by Liu Bingqi, dominates the entire village. His family still had more than three hectares of land after the Incident and is currently the accountant, controlling village affairs. Dong Hao, led by Hao Lizhi, has served as the puppet Bao chief and puppet village chief, and is still the village chief, making a fortune by embezzling village funds. During the mass movement last year, in order to evade the masses' liquidation, these two feudal forces colluded, using clan relations to create contradictions and divert the target. Hao Lizhi controlled Liu Hongcao, the director of the Qian Liu farmers' association, who falsely accused Liu Jinfu and others, poor peasants from Hou Liu, of stealing a burden that was lost by the farmers' association, and punished eleven poor peasant households. Later, when Liu Hongzhang organized the women's association, the Qian Liu landlords spread rumors that Hongzhang was having affairs with women, and the Hou Liu landlords took the opportunity to instigate the entire village to call back soldiers from the village who were participating in the × group to beat the Qian Liu masses. Fooled by them, the masses of Hao Village harbored deep hatred for each other. After the turnaround team went deep into the situation to understand the true facts, they detained the five landlords and the three Hao Lizhi brothers. Based on the specific facts, they conducted in-depth group deliberations, and from the mutual accusations and confrontations, everyone realized that the disunity was caused by the landlords, and the masses' hatred turned towards the landlords. A struggle session was launched, the prestige of the despotic landlord Hao Lizhi was defeated, and it was decided that the treacherous and domineering landlord should be swept out the door, with all belongings belonging to the farmers' association.

　　武城检查土改不彻底原因
  　清算右倾领导思想
    【本报冀南二十五日电】武城检查发现去冬今春之土地改革运动，尚系“夹生饭”，浮财大部未动，百分之七十地主，仍保持地主生活；从政治上看，地主并未斗得低头，还不断向群众进攻，以金钱美女收买干部、积极分子，或假积极忧抗，借此拉拢军属，挑拨干群关系。贫农向其借取东西时，他们说风凉话：“你们翻身啦，还向我借东西？”再就是隐蔽原形，辞退雇佃，改雇短工，分家，降低成份，或钻进各种组织，暗掌统治权。据六十八村统计，九七五个村干中，有地主二三个，富农二七个，中农四四六个，赤贫农仅四七九个。由于地主未消灭，贫要求未满足，故贫农说：“翻身哩，不向人家（指地主）借取还是不行！”检查夹生原因，主要是领导思想右倾，划出圈子，规定给地主留生活，过分强调照顾军属地主，因而当贫农要求将地主扫地出门时，我们不予批准；再加未树立贫骨干，当权者中农占一半，故便斗争不彻底。
    【本报冀南二十五日电】景县三区郝庄，七十三户，分前刘、后刘、东郝三家族，后刘以刘秉奇为首统治全村。他家在事变后尚有土地三顷多，现任司帐员，掌握村政。东郝以郝立枝为首，历任伪保长伪村长，现仍当村长，贪污村款发财。去年群运时，为逃避群众清算，这两种封建势力便勾结起来，利用家族关系，制造矛盾，转移目标。郝立枝掌握前刘农会主任刘洪草，因农会丢一个包袱，诬说后刘贫农刘金富等偷去，处罚了十一户贫农；后来刘洪章组织妇会时，前刘地主又造谣洪章搞女人，后刘地主即乘机挑拨全村叫来本村参加×团的战士，打前刘的群众。郝庄群众在他们的愚弄下，互相结下了深仇大恨。翻身队到此深入了解真实情况后，把五个地主及郝立枝弟兄三人，都扣了起来，根据具体事实深入小组酝酿，从互相对面诉苦对证中，大家认识不团结是地主造成的，群众仇恨的锋芒，转向了地主，展开诉苦斗争，地主郝立枝的威风被打垮了，决议将奸霸地主扫地出门，东西全部归农会。
