Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 5th: Prices in Shanghai, Guangzhou, and other places have risen again recently due to the stimulation of news that the Chiang government will abandon the legal tender and issue new currency. According to Central News Agency's price report: Shanghai rice prices once fell back in mid-last month, but have risen again to 425,000 yuan per shi at the beginning of this month, an increase of 35,000 yuan per shi; the price of top-quality rice is even higher, at 430,000 yuan per shi. According to Reuters Shanghai dispatch on the 3rd: the prices of other commodities have also risen at the same time, stimulating black market trading in gold bars and US dollars. According to United Press International Hong Kong dispatch on the 28th of last month: the Guangzhou market, which fluctuates with the Shanghai market, has also fluctuated due to the above news, and the prices of general commodities have risen by 50 percent, of which the price of rice has risen from 220,000 to 380,000 per shi, the price of local products has increased by 30 percent, and foreign goods by 50 percent. The exchange rate has reached 40,000 to 1.

Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 5th: According to a compilation of Shanghai Ta Kung Pao news: Due to the increasingly deepening crisis of the Chiang Kai-shek's puppet regime, capital in the Chiang-controlled areas is fleeing to "safe havens." This phenomenon was initially manifested as the concentration of capital from Chiang-occupied cities in the north to Shanghai. According to statistics from Shanghai commercial banks in January, February, and March, the amount of money remitted to Shanghai from various places exceeded the amount remitted from Shanghai by more than three times, and in April it increased to four times. The trend of remittances to Shanghai by the "Four Banks," the financial monopoly institutions of the four major families, was even more significant. In May, the amount of money remitted to Shanghai from the mainland exceeded the amount remitted from Shanghai by a huge 13 times. It is estimated that by the end of June, the amount of northern capital fleeing to Shanghai had reached several hundred billion yuan. Now, the phenomenon of capital flight has developed into a new stage. Although so much capital has gathered in Shanghai, the deposits of various banks in Shanghai have still been withdrawn in large quantities recently, because those who hold the capital are vying to hoard goods, and at the same time, a large amount of capital fleeing to Shanghai is mostly used as a transit point to continue fleeing south to Hong Kong and Guangdong. The exchange rate in South China has fluctuated sharply. Although the Chiang government's "Four Banks" restricted the amount of money remitted to Guangdong and Fujian provinces by various banks to only 50 million per week, it was ineffective, because the general public still tried to remit the money to Hengyang, Wuzhou, and other places first, and then transfer it to the ports and Guangdong in South China. According to a Central News Agency Shanghai dispatch on the 3rd: Overseas remittances to the Chiang-controlled areas have also decreased month by month. The "Bank of China" published figures for three months, with April being 20,271,158,780.50 yuan, May having been halved to 10,536,666,731.36 yuan, and June having decreased even more drastically to less than one-fifth of the original amount, namely 3,843,290,724.95 yuan.

    南京小朝廷危机益深
    沪粤物价再度猛涨
    北方资金大量南逃侨汇激降
    【新华社陕北五日电】上海、广州等地物价，近因蒋政府将废弃法币发行新货币消息的刺激，又呈上涨。据中央社物价报导：上月中旬上海米价曾一度回跌，本月初已重新涨为四十二万五千元，每石上涨三万五千元；上等稻更高，每石四十三万元。据路透社上海三日电称：其他商品价格也同时涨高，并刺激了金条美钞的黑市交易。据合众社上月二十八日香港电：随上海市场涨落的广州市场，亦因上项消息而波动，一般商品价格已上涨百分之五十，其中米价已由每石二十二万涨至三十八万，土产品价格增高百分之三十，洋货百分之五十。外汇方面已达四万比一之兑换率。
    【新华社陕北五日电】综合沪大公报消息：由于蒋家小朝廷日益加深之危机，蒋管区资金纷向“安全地带”逃避，此现象最初表现为北方蒋占城市之资金向沪集中。据上海市商业行庄一、二、三月份之统计，各地汇沪款项较上海汇出者超过三倍，四月份则增至四倍，四大家族金融垄断机构之“四行”汇款逃沪趋势则更显著，五月份由内地汇沪款项较上海汇出款项超出十三倍之巨。据估计至六月下旬，北方资金逃沪者已达数千亿元。现在则资金逃避现象已发展为新的阶段。虽有如此大量资金集沪，但上海各行庄之存款近仍大量被提取，原因为握有资金者争相囤货，同时大量逃沪之资金又多以上海为转渡口，继续南逃到港、粤去。华南汇率发生激剧波动。蒋政府“四行”虽限制各行庄汇往粤、闽二省款项，每周仅以五千万为限，但无成效，因一般人仍设法把款项先汇至衡阳、梧州等地，再转汇华南港粤。又据中央社上海三日讯：蒋管区侨汇亦逐月激降，“中国银行”发表三个月之数字，四月份为二百零二亿七千一百五十八万七千八百零四元五角，五月份已减半为一百零五亿三千六百六十六万六千七百三十一元三角六分，六月份更激减为原数五分之一弱，即为三十八亿四千三百二十九万零七百二十四元九角五分。
