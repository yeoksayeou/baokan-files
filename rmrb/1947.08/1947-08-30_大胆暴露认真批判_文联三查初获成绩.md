　　Boldly Expose, Seriously Criticize
　　Initial Achievements of the Literary Federation's Three Checks Campaign
　　[Our Newspaper's Report] Responding to the call for the Three Checks, cadres of the Border Region Literary Federation engaged in land reform study. In the past month, they conducted a thorough reckoning of their class background, ideology, and experiences. Because few cadres participated in the land reform movement, and most were intellectual literary workers from cities, the leadership requested everyone to make a comprehensive historical review. Cadres from various backgrounds made detailed reflections, focusing on: 1. Their class background. 2. Their motives for joining the revolution, the path they took to revolution, and ideological changes. 3. Their understanding of land reform. 4. A review of literary ideology. After reflection, they reported to everyone, and everyone asked questions to help them dig into the roots of their thinking, conduct analysis and criticism, reflect and supplement again, and finally write a summary of ideological reflection to be submitted to the group for discussion and approval.
　　During the study, all comrades boldly exposed their thoughts: for example, some wanted to hide their class background, some doubted this study, some felt the peasants were dirty and unwilling to approach them, some even felt the peasants were hypocritical, and some expressed doubts about the mass struggle... After exposure, they became alert to the fact that they had overemphasized their revolutionary consciousness in the past, but their actual connection with the revolution was still very weak, and they lacked genuine ideological awareness. There was still strong individualism, detachment from the masses, and failure to see the strength of the masses. These serious shortcomings were always enough to make them break away from the revolution and endanger the revolution. Some comrades were shocked after reflection. As one comrade said in his study summary: "I now realize that I was actually wholeheartedly planning for myself, and serving the revolution and the people incidentally!" At the end of the first stage of study, everyone unanimously requested to further deepen their study to solve these two problems: 1. Understanding of the Chinese revolution, especially the understanding of the peasant problem. 2. How to combine with the masses, what to learn from the masses, as preparation for going to the countryside after autumn. The second stage of study has now begun. The main reason for such gains in this study is that the leadership repeatedly explained that this study mainly aims to draw a clear line between classes, examine positions, eliminate non-class and non-revolutionary consciousness, so as not to fall behind in the vigorous land reform movement, and to improve and transform oneself politically and ideologically, which inspired everyone's consciousness. Second: Emphasizing that study should look at problems from the standpoint and viewpoint of the class, therefore the attitude is relatively calm and objective, able to analyze oneself more deeply, and be sincere and frank with each other, in the spirit of treating illnesses and saving people, to transform thinking.

　　大胆暴露认真批判
  　文联三查初获成绩
    【本报讯】边区文联干部，响应三查号召，进行土改学习，在最近一个月内，进行了自己的阶级出身、思想、经历的大清算。因为干部参加土地改革运动的不多，又大都为来自城市的知识分子文艺工作者，所以领导上提出要求大家作全面的历史的检查。各种不同出身的干部都作了详细的反省，重点为：一、自己的阶级出身。二、参加革命的动机，走向革命的道路以及思想上的变迁。三、对土地改革的认识。四、文艺思想的检讨。反省后并向大家报告，大家提问来帮助他挖掘思想根源，进行分析与批判，自己再次作反省与补充，最后再写出思想反省总结，交小组讨论通过。
    学习中全体同志都大胆暴露自己思想：如有的想隐瞒自己阶级出身，有的对这次学习怀疑，有的觉得农民脏，不愿去接近，有的甚至觉得农民虚伪，有的对群众斗争表示怀疑………等。经过暴露，警惕到过去太强调了自己的革命意识，实际与革命的联系还很薄弱，还缺乏真正的思想觉悟。还存在着强烈的个人主义，脱离群众，看不见群众力量等，这些严重缺点，又随时足以使自己脱离革命，危害革命。反省后有些同志大吃一惊，如一个同志在学习总结时说：“我到现在才知道：我实际上是全心全意为个人打算，附带为革命为人民服务的！”在第一阶段学习终了，大家一致要求自己更进一步深入学习，解决这两个问题：一、对中国革命的认识，特别是农民问题的认识。二、如何跟群众结合，向群众学习什么，作为秋后下乡的准备。现已开始进入第二阶段学习。这次学习中能够有这样收获，主要是由于领导上反复说明：这次学习主要是要划清阶级界限检查立场，清除非阶级非革命意识，不致在轰轰烈烈的土改运动中掉了队，在政治上思想上提高自己，改造自己，启发了大家的自觉性。第二：强调学习以阶级的立场、观点来看问题，因之态度比较冷静客观，能够比较深刻的分析自己，相互之间作到诚恳坦白，以治病救人的精神，来改造思想。
