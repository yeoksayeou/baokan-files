　　Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 23rd. New York dispatch: Former U.S. Undersecretary of State Welles, in discussing the peace treaty with Japan, put forward an opinion contrary to that of the U.S. government. He argued that for the sake of continued world peace, it is necessary to obtain Soviet approval for the peace treaty with Japan. He predicted that excluding the Soviet Union and other major powers from the control of the peace treaty with Japan would have "unimaginable consequences." Welles believes that most of what the American public knows about the occupation of Japan is "completely false reporting." Welles criticized: The Japanese constitution was almost entirely drafted by the American occupation authorities.

    商谈对日和约问题必须征得苏联同意
    【新华社陕北二十三日电】纽约讯：前美副国务卿威尔斯在谈对日和约时提出与美官方相反的意见。主张为继续世界和平计，征得苏联对日和约之同意实为必要。他对于排斥苏联与其他强国执行对日和约之管制发出预测称：“其后还将不堪设想。”威氏认为美国民众一向所知关于日本之占领工作，多半为“全部错误之报导”。威氏批评称：日本之宪法几乎全部由美国占领当局所草拟。
