Wei County Places Emphasis on Learning from Model Cases and Promoting Manure Accumulation in Preparation for Wheat Planting
    [Our Newspaper, Jinnan, 17th] Wei County is promoting manure accumulation by rewarding good deeds and learning from model cases. In the ninth district, the mutual aid groups, with Party members as the core, accumulated 150 cartloads of manure in a seven-day blitz. On the 3rd of this month, they used the method of reporting good deeds and learning from model cases to discuss the experiences and achievements of each group in manure accumulation, and the Jing Hongbo group was recognized as the best. The group of eight carried manure baskets even when weeding, didn't take a nap for two days, dug a pit that could hold fifteen cartloads of manure, got up before dawn to sweep the street soil; the artemisia, green grass, locust flowers, and watermelon rinds they cut back were all dumped inside, then sprinkled with foul water, and people went into the pit to trample back and forth, accumulating sixteen cartloads of manure in seven days. The group also created a method of using manure as a primer, and the accumulated manure was good and fast, earning them a merit. The village plans to plant 1,800 mu of wheat, and with the existing manure calculated at two cartloads per mu, there are still 980 mu of land without fertilizer. Everyone unanimously felt that manure accumulation is still a major task at hand, and decided that in the coming period, manure accumulation will be one of the main tasks.
    [Our Newspaper, Jinnan, 17th] "More manure, more grain", villages in Wei County are busily accumulating manure in preparation for wheat planting. Guo Quan, from Xiaoligu, fermented nineteen cartloads of manure last year and applied it to nine mu of wheat. This year, he harvested one-third more per mu than others. He accepted last year's experience and plans to accumulate twenty cartloads of manure by the time of buckwheat planting. The Ganji Primary School launched a campaign to earn merit by collecting manure, planning to accumulate seventy cartloads of manure by the time of wheat planting. Chu Zhenming, a student who had just been liberated, remembered that his father had been working since he was eighteen years old and had never eaten white flour dumplings. He was determined to plant a rich seedling and work hard to produce. His father discussed with him: "What should we do if we have land but no manure?" He then said that he would pick up manure every day, and his father smiled and said, "You are studying and still picking up manure, I am farming and I should pick up even more!" The father and son carried manure and soil every time they went out, picking up two soil carts in half a month. Su Chunling from Wangjiazhuang dug three manure pits, picked up manure whenever he saw it when weeding, and pushed soil and sprinkled water during lunch breaks and evenings, accumulating twenty-four large carts of manure in a month, and everyone praised his diligence. Even Wang Jinduo, who didn't work hard, was influenced by him and dug a manure pit. Li Tianchen, a production expert in the third district, carried a manure basket every time he went to the field to work, and his sixteen mu of autumn seedlings were generally fertilized twice. As soon as the dog days began, he dug two large manure pits and had already fermented half of the pit, preparing to apply three large cartloads of fertilizer to each mu of wheat land. When the three mutual aid groups in Xihekou discussed the wheat planting plan, they all felt that fertilizer was difficult, so the village cadres immediately introduced the Ganji manure accumulation experience, mobilized everyone to accumulate manure, and led the group members to dig four manure pits, stipulating that each manure pit should be sprinkled with twenty loads of water during the midday break, and spare time to sweep the street soil and cut green grass. Nansunzhuang planted a lot of melons this year, and they are planning to use the money from selling melons to buy manure for wheat planting. Five mutual aid groups in Dongtang Village are carrying out a blitz, accumulating manure from grass and pulling wild hemp. Zhang Jingui went out to pick up manure every day at dawn, and had accumulated four large carts of manure in a month.
