Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 15th. Following the brazen announcement by American imperialism that the American military rapist Pierson was innocent, this has already provoked a strong reaction among the students of Beiping, who personally experienced this atrocity. According to a United Press dispatch from Beiping on the 14th: The North China Student Federation, composed of universities in Peiping, Tianjin, and Tangshan, is drafting a declaration calling on students across the country to take action to protest this measure by the Chiang government. The Democracy Wall at Peking University is covered with giant posters protesting Pierson's acquittal. "Sharp and critical" slogans have also appeared at Tsinghua University. All newspapers in Peiping prominently published the Chiang government's handling of Pierson, with the semi-official "Chronicle" commenting that this handling was "a major blow to highly educated Chinese who believe in American 'justice,'" and pointing out that this move will inevitably "increase Chinese hatred of the United States."

　　强奸罪犯竟告无罪
  　北平学生强烈抗议
    【新华社陕北十五日电】美国帝国主义悍然宣布美军强奸罪犯皮尔逊无罪后，已首先在亲历此一暴行的北平学生中激起强烈反应。据美合众社北平十四日电称：由平、津、唐山各大学组成的华北学联，正起草宣言，号召全国学生以行动抗议蒋政府此一措施。北大民主墙上满贴巨型标语，抗议皮尔逊无罪开释。清华大学亦出现“措词辛谏”的标语口号。平市各报均以显著地位刊载蒋政府对皮尔逊的处置，半官方“纪事报”评论此处置为：“这对于相信美国‘正义’的高等华人是一个大打击”，并指出此举必“助长中国人对美国的仇恨”。
