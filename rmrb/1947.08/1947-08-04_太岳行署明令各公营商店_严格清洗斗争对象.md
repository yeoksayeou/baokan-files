    Taiyue Administrative Office Orders All Publicly Operated Stores to Strictly Purge Class Struggle Targets
    [This newspaper’s Taiyue dispatch, 1st] The Taiyue Administrative Office has issued an order to all publicly operated stores to strictly purge class struggle targets. Since the land reform, many class struggle targets have evaded struggle by infiltrating stores, factories, and hotels, and have intimidated the masses by falsely using the power of the public sector. To this end, the Administrative Office specifically issued an order on July 16 to all publicly operated stores to strictly examine every staff member (including manual workers) and immediately remove anyone found to be a class struggle target in order to achieve the goal of connecting with the masses. After rectification, if it is discovered that any class struggle targets are still retained, the manager will be subject to legal punishment for harboring class struggle targets.
    [This newspaper’s dispatch] Workers at the Zhenhua Handicraft Cooperative combated feudalism and discovered that landlord Wu Fengxian had infiltrated the revolutionary factory. He was not actively engaged in work himself and also influenced others not to work properly. During amateur production, he complained about the smell of manure. When Li Jinxiang made shoes for the army, he sabotaged her, saying, "Don't give them to the army, sell them for two or three thousand yuan, you can't spend it yourself." He stole a lot of yarn and soap from the lower workshop. After the investigation, it was unanimously decided to expel him from the factory. (Taihang Workers' Union Third Branch)

    太岳行署明令各公营商店
    严格清洗斗争对象
    【本报太岳一日电】太岳行署明令各公营商店，严格清洗斗争对象。自土地改革以来，不少斗争对象为逃避斗争，混入商店、工厂、酒店，并假借公家势力，威吓群众。为此，行署特于七月十六日明令各公营商店，对每个工作人员（包括工杂人员）严加审查，如属斗争对象，必须立即清除，达到联系群众的目的。经整顿后，如发现仍有留用斗争对象者，经理应受包庇斗争对象之法律处分。
    【本报讯】振华工艺社工友挤封建，查出地主武凤仙混入了革命工厂，自己不积极干，并且活动别人也不好好干。在业余生产时，他嫌上粪臭，李金香做劳军鞋，他就破坏说：“你不要给军队，卖他二、三千元，不能自己花。”偷了下坊许多毛线、肥皂，查出后一致决定把他开除工厂。（太行职会三分会）
