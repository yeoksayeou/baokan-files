    [This Dispatch from the JiluYu News Agency, dated the 6th] To render meritorious service to the people and actively cooperate with the main force advancing south, Nanwang County has launched a campaign to capture Chiang Kai-shek's troops. The Nanwang County Brigade, on the 14th of last month, when Liu Bocheng's army annihilated two divisions of Chiang's troops north of Jinxiang, advanced to Guolou Village and encountered the headquarters of the 139th Brigade and remnants of the 415th Regiment of the 32nd Division that had slipped through the net. The enemy first deployed heavy weapons and fired fiercely at us. Our brigade, with two companies, quickly and bravely counterattacked the enemy, immediately rushing into the village, occupying the entire village, and continuing to charge at the enemy's position. The enemy, unable to withstand the attack, retreated southwest and directly south. Within half an hour, the enemy was completely defeated, and a portion of the enemy was annihilated. A total of five heavy machine guns, five light machine guns, three Sten submachine guns, four mules and horses, more than ten rifles, and three carts of ammunition and shells were seized, and more than 50 enemy officers and soldiers were captured. We only suffered two minor injuries. After the various units of the 129th Brigade of Chiang's 32nd Division were annihilated and routed by our main force, large groups, even companies and battalions of defeated soldiers, roamed everywhere in our Fourth and Fifth Districts. Upon hearing this, our village self-defense forces, cadres, and militia immediately launched a campaign to capture them. Gunshots echoed everywhere in the green crops. The scattered enemies were surrounded by our people's guerrilla groups, like rabbits in a trap, panicking and scurrying through the green crops. Comrade Chai Chunming of the Military Affairs Committee led a group that seized twelve Zhongzheng rifles, one Stagg submachine gun, and one Canadian submachine gun, as well as 350 rounds of ammunition. In the Fourth District, a group of over 20 enemies, upon being overtaken by the militia, immediately knelt down and cried, "Have mercy, sirs!" District Director Comrade Wang Zhaocai obtained a heavy machine gun by himself. One militia comrade obtained three "insurance boxes" (likely Mauser C96 pistols), and the remaining comrades obtained a total of eight Zhongzheng rifles and three cases of ammunition for Canadian Sten submachine guns. A total of 212 enemy officers and soldiers were captured.

    [This Dispatch from the JiluYu News Agency, dated the 6th] To cooperate with the victorious advance of Liu and Deng's army southward, the people of Nanwang County automatically provided 1,700 stretchers in twenty days, successfully completing the task. When the stretcher mission was conveyed to each village, many people ran back from the fields, gathering automatically. Seventy-one villages didn't even have time to report and went directly to the troops to make contact and complete the mission. After the recovery of Yuncheng, the command post asked each district for three or four front-line stretchers, but dozens of stretchers were offered eagerly and automatically. In the Seventh District alone, 70 stretchers went to the front line. The stretchers from Xiaoyao Village in the Sixth District and Xu Mou Wu Damiao Village in the Second District carried wounded soldiers back and forth on the front line several times in one night, forgetting the threat of artillery fire. Some were injured but insisted on carrying the stretchers back. Some even used their own money to buy eggs for the wounded soldiers, who were moved to tears. One stretcher team even cooperated with the troops to capture 20 "Homecoming Corps" members. In addition to this, they also launched a "People Love the People" movement, helping the masses fetch water and hoe seedlings during lulls in the fighting. Compared to the situation last winter and this spring, Nanwang's participation in the war with stretchers has made leaps and bounds. The main reason is that Nanwang has thoroughly implemented land reform, and the masses are more awakened. The leadership has also learned from past experiences and lessons, conducting education before departure to establish a sense of organization, and organizing the stretchers into squads, teams, platoons, and companies, establishing a system of rewards and punishments, and conducting timely inspections and encouragement, promoting activists, and creating a competition between villages and teams, cherishing the stretchers, and leaders sharing the hardships with them, and taking care of them in their lives.

    南旺翻身农民积极支援战争
    民兵捕捉漏网蒋军
    担架队胜利完成任务
    【本报冀鲁豫六日电】为人民立功，积极配合南进主力作战，南旺全县展开捕捉蒋军运动。南旺县大队于上月十四日在刘伯承大军歼灭金乡以北蒋军两个师时，进到郭楼村沿，与漏网的三十二师一三九旅旅部及四一五团残部遭遇，敌首先展开重武器，向我猛烈射击，我大队以两个连的兵力迅速向敌勇猛反击，当即冲入村内，占领全村，并继续向敌阵地冲去，敌不支向西南、正南溃退，半小时内完全击退敌人，并歼敌一部，总计缴获重机枪五挺、轻机枪五挺、斯登手提机枪三挺、骡马四匹、步枪十余支、子弹炮弹三大车，俘敌官兵五十余名。我只轻伤二名。蒋军三十二师一二九旅各部遭我主力歼灭和击溃后，有大股的甚至成营成连的败兵在我四五区到处流窜，我各村自卫队，干部及民兵听说后，马上到处展开捕捉运动，青纱帐里，到处响起枪声，逃散的敌人为我解放区人民的各个游击小组包围起来，象被围的兔子，惊慌万状，在青纱帐里乱钻。武委会柴春明同志带的一个组缴了十二支中正式、一支斯答顾式、一支加拿大式手提机枪。还有三百五十发子弹。在四区一股敌二十余人被民兵追上都马上跪下叫：“老爷饶命！”区主任王兆材同志一个人得了重机枪一挺，一个民兵同志得到三支保险盒子，其余同志共得中正式八支、加拿大斯登手提机枪的子弹三箱。俘敌官兵共二百十二人。
    【本报冀鲁豫六日电】为配合刘邓南渡大军的胜利出击，南旺县人民在二十天中，自动出担架一千七百付，胜利完成任务。当担架的任务传到每村里时，许多人从地里跑回来，自动集合，有七十一个村离的还没赶上。就直接到部队去取联系。完成任务。郓城收复后，指挥部向每区要三四付火线担架，结果数十付担架争先恐后的自动报名。仅七区赴火线者，即有七十付。六区小窑村和二区徐某吴大庙的担架，一夜在火线上来回抬了好几次伤号，忘掉炮火的威胁。有的受了伤，也坚持把担架抬回来。有的把自己的钱，都给伤号买鸡蛋吃，伤号感动的流泪。有一个担架小队，还配合部队捉住了廿个“还乡团”。除此以外，他们还发起“民爱民”运动，在战斗空隙中，帮助群众挑水锄苗，较之去冬今春的情况，南旺参战担架有飞跃的进步。其主要原因，是南旺已经彻底实行了土地改革，群众的觉悟更高了。领导上也接受了以前的经验教训，出发先进行教育，建立组织观念，并把担架编制为班、小队、分队、中队、订出赏罚制度，及时检查及鼓励，推动积极分子，掀起了村与村、小队与小队的竞赛，爱护担架，领导人员与他们同甘苦，多在生活上照顾他们。
