    Gaoling Guancheng
    Mobilization Lags Behind
    [This newspaper's Ji-Lu-Yu dispatch, 2nd] The mobilization of backward villages and backward people in Gaoling (County) and Guancheng (County) lags behind. At a meeting of cadres in the Third District of Gaoling, the reason for the existence of backward villages and backward people was discussed. Everyone unanimously agreed that the fundamental reason was that landlords had not been eliminated. They used petty favors to buy off the masses and used feudal and backward ideas to control the peasants. Wang Guohuo of Wen Xinggu Village was very poor. He had been building a house for a year and a half, lived in it for three months, and it collapsed again in the rain, injuring his child's leg. The landlord, Wen Zhushan, a medical practitioner, pretended to be kind and took the initiative to see him and did not charge for medicine. Thus, Wang Guohuo considered Wen Zhushan his benefactor. He said: "I won't do it if anyone asks me to struggle against Wen Zhushan." Wang Guohuo thus fell behind. At the same time, the cadres looked down on backward elements, lacked patient education, and adopted an attitude of isolating and attacking them. If they did not attend a meeting once, they would be criticized, given fewer fruits, and allocated land that was either bad or far away. This only made them dissatisfied and even more passive and backward, creating an opportunity for landlords to counterattack and sabotage. In addition, the cadres always believed that backward villages would not progress, and whoever went to work in that village would not get any credit, so no one wanted to work in that village. The director of the Armed Committee went to the Third District, but never went to Shangzhuang Village, thinking that the village was backward. They did not respect their opinions at meetings, so the work in their village was even less active. Over time, it became a backward village. Everyone discussed how to mobilize backward villages and decided to thoroughly eliminate the landlords and mobilize backward villages and backward people together. Since the Second District of Guancheng, Shiziyuan (Persimmon Garden), struggled against the middle peasant Zhao Xingchen, the middle peasants have shown panic and depression. Some did not participate in organizations, and those who participated in organizations did not dare to express their opinions when settling accounts with the landlords, showing backwardness. Since the district cadres convened a meeting of village cadres and activists, they proposed to unite the middle peasants, unite the majority, face the landlords, and eliminate backwardness. After the village cadres returned home, they held mass meetings, explaining that the poor and middle peasants were one family, reviewing the mistakes of struggling against the middle peasants in the past. After everyone's discussion, they returned the things to Zhao Xingchen. The other middle peasants dispelled their worries, were extremely happy, and automatically became active, settling accounts with the landlords.

    高陵观城
    发动落后
    【本报冀鲁豫二日电】高（陵）观（城）发动落后村落后人。高陵三区干部会上，讨论为啥有落后村落后人时，大家一致认为基本原因是地主没有被消灭，用小恩小惠收买群众，和地主利用封建落后思想，掌握农民。温邢固村王国活很穷，一间房子盖了一年半，住了三个月，下雨又塌毁，压伤他孩子的腿，地主温竹善是看病先生，便假貌为善的自动去看，并且吃药不要钱。这样王国活便认为温竹善是他恩人了。他说：谁要叫我斗温竹善，我是不干。王国活就这样落后下去了。同时，干部对落后分子轻视，耐心教育不够，采取孤立打击态度，一次不参加会议，就加以批评，分果实少分，给他分地不是坏地就是远地。这样只有使他不满，更加消极落后，造成了给地主反攻破坏的机会。另外，干部总认为落后村不会进步，谁到那村去工作也是出力不讨好，谁也不愿到那村工作。武委会主任到三区，从来没去过尚庄，思想上认为那个村落后，开会时对他们的意见也不尊重，这样他村工作更不积极，长期下去，便成了落后村。大家讨论如何发动落后村，决定要彻底消灭地主，只有对落后村落后人一齐发动。观城二区柿子园自从斗了中农赵兴臣，中农表现恐慌消沉，有的不参加组织，参加组织的在向地主清算时也不敢提意见，表现落后。自区干召开村干积极分子会，提出要联合中农，团结多数，面向地主，消除落后。村干回家后，便开群众会，说明中贫农是一家，检讨过去斗争中农的不对，经过大家商量，把东西退给赵兴臣，其他中农解除顾虑，高兴异常，自动积极起来，向地主算帐。
