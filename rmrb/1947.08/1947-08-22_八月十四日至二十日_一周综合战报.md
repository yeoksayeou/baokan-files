Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 20th. Good news has come from Soviet Jiangsu behind enemy lines. Since the 6th, the People's Liberation Army launched an offensive against Ye Ting City, completely annihilating over 7,200 troops of the Chiang army's remnants of Hao Pengju's First Division in a week. It captured alive four major generals, three regimental commanders, and Chiang's county magistrate, totaling over 6,700 people. It recovered Ye Ting City and over ten towns including Wuyao and Baiju, controlled 200 li of the Tongyu Highway, and recovered 8,000 square li of areas on both sides of the highway. The headquarters of our East China People's Liberation Army and the Central China Military Region issued orders to commend this glorious victory.

The heroic struggle of the military and civilians behind enemy lines in Central China is the most brilliant page in the patriotic self-defense war in the occupied areas. Despite the Chiang army concentrating its forces to repeatedly carry out "bloody cleansing" and "scorched earth cleansing," in the Central Jiangsu area alone, 20,000 people were killed, 10,000 able-bodied men were conscripted, and over 30,000 women were raped in one year. Its brutality surpassed the Japanese invaders' "Three Alls" policy, but the military and civilians of Central China transformed grief and indignation into strength, united as one and persisted to the end. In independent operations, they tied down around 100,000 of Chiang's troops, annihilated 50,000 enemies (based on half a year in Northern Jiangsu), and maintained 80% of the clean land in Central China. Except for cities and some towns, the vast countryside has always been in the hands of the People's Liberation Army. In the face of the heroic struggle of the military and civilians, the Chiang army's disintegration was revealed. Under the political offensive of the broad masses in Central China, from February to June in Dongtai (East) and Taibei areas of Central Jiangsu alone, over 3,400 Chiang army soldiers were won over, accounting for two-thirds of the total number of Chiang and puppet troops in the area. It must be pointed out that the reason why the military and civilians of Central China were able to achieve such a great victory was precisely because they carried out in-depth land reform. From July to September last year, more than 2 million farmers in ten counties of the Yancheng-Funing area of Northern Jiangsu were distributed more than 3.4 million mu of land. In one month last autumn, more than 30,000 liberated farmers joined the People's Liberation Army. This year, on "August 1st" again, more than 5,500 liberated farmers poured into the People's Liberation Army to fight the Chiang army for revenge and to protect their land.

In the southwestern Shandong area, after annihilating nine and a half brigades of Chiang's army, Liu and Deng's army went straight down to the Longhai Railway. On the 11th, they recovered the two cities of Shanxian and Ningling. On the 12th, they recovered Suixian City and stations such as Mamuxiaoba, surrounded Shangqiu, and controlled more than 120 li of the railway.

In the Jin-Cha-Ji area, after the Chiang army's harassment in central Hebei failed, it concentrated 30,000 troops and once again scurried to harass the areas north of the Daqing River in Xiongxian, Xinzhen, Baxian, and Yongqing, starting on the 6th. At the same time, it harassed our liberated areas bordering Beiping from the Changping area. Our liberated area military and civilians are rising up to resist and respond to the enemy's so-called "mopping up" with counter-mopping up.

　　八月十四日至二十日
  　一周综合战报
    【新华社陕北二十日电】捷音自蒋后苏北传来，解放军自六日开始向叶挺城展开攻势，一周间全歼蒋军郝逆鹏举残部第一师等七千二百余人，生俘师长李铁民等四个少将三个团长及蒋记县长等六千七百余人，收复叶挺城及伍＠白驹等十余城镇，控制通榆公路二百华里及收复公路两侧八千平方里的地区。对这一光辉胜利，我华东人民解放军总部和华中军区曾传令嘉奖。
    华中敌后军民的英勇斗争是沦陷区爱国自卫战争中最灿烂的一页。尽管蒋军集中兵力反复的进行“血洗清剿”“焦土清剿”，仅苏中地区一年间即被残杀二万人，抓走壮丁一万人，被奸淫妇女三万余人，其残暴超过了日寇的三光政策，但华中军民化悲愤为力量，团结一致始终坚持。他们在独立作战中，拖住了蒋军十万上下的兵力，歼敌达五万人（苏北以半年计）保持着华中百分之八十的干净土地，除城市及部分市镇外，广大乡村始终在解放军手里。在军民英勇斗争的面前，却显出了蒋军的分崩离拆。在华中广大群众的政治攻势下，仅苏中东台（东）台北地区自二月至六月即争取三千四百余蒋军士兵来归，占该地区蒋伪总数的三分之二，必须指出华中军民所以能获得如此巨大胜利，正是因为进行了深入的土地改革，自去年七月至九月，苏北盐阜区十个县即有二百余万农民分得了三百四十余万亩土地，去秋一个月内，苏中翻身农民参加解放军者即达三万余人。今年“八一”又有五千五百余翻身农民涌入解放军，向蒋军进行复仇保田斗争。
    鲁西南方面，刘邓大军于歼灭蒋军九个半旅之后直下陇海线。十一日收复单县、宁陵两城，十二日曾收复睢县城及马牧小坝等车站，包围商邱，控制铁路一百二十余里。
    晋察冀方面，蒋军在冀中骚扰失败后，又集中三万兵力自六日起再度窜扰大清河以北之雄县、新镇、霸县、永清地区，并同时由昌平一带向我北平毗连之解放区出扰，我解放区军民正奋起阻击，以反扫荡回答敌人之所谓“扫荡”中。
