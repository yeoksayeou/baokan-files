Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, August 26th: TASS, Moscow, August 24th: Soviet Foreign Minister Molotov recently replied to the note of August 12th from U.S. Secretary of State Marshall regarding the work of the Soviet-American Joint Commission on Korea. The reply detailed the Soviet government's views on how the Joint Commission should consult with Korean political parties and social organizations to establish a provisional government. Molotov first refuted Marshall on the issue of which parties and organizations could participate in the consultations. Marshall had requested that Korean "democratic" parties and organizations should obtain the "broadest possible participation," meaning that any party or organization could participate. Molotov retorted: "The consultation objects of the Joint Commission are the democratic parties and social organizations that fully support the Moscow Conference's decision on Korea. Parties and organizations belonging to the 'Anti-Moscow Trusteeship Resolution Committee' can only be allowed to participate in consultations after severing relations with the aforementioned committee and declaring their withdrawal. The Soviet Union insists on extensive consultation with Korean democratic parties and organizations but does not wish to consult with groups with only dozens or hundreds of members because there are many such groups and they lack authority. Consulting with them would not only be ineffective but would also delay the work of the Joint Commission and postpone the establishment of a Korean provisional government. The Soviet government believes that 'only parties and organizations with more than 10,000 members should be invited to participate in consultations.'" Secondly, regarding the freedom of the Korean people to express their opinions, Marshall had vaguely stated that it "should not be subject to any restrictions." Molotov replied: "The freedom to express opinions during consultations should not be restricted, and this treatment should first be given to those parties and organizations that insist on implementing the Moscow resolution. However, recently in southern Korea, parties and organizations that support the Moscow resolution have been subjected to the most severe restrictions and persecution by the U.S. authorities. This move violates democratic principles and runs counter to the Moscow Conference. The buildings of these parties and organizations have been occupied by the police, their leaders and members have been arrested, and their publishing organs have been closed down. The Soviet government believes that this situation cannot be tolerated. If these acts of persecution are not immediately and completely stopped, they will inevitably hinder the true implementation of the Moscow Three Foreign Ministers Conference resolution on Korea." Finally, regarding the issue of the commission reporting on its work, Molotov expressed agreement with Marshall's suggestion: "The Soviet government does not object to the suggestion that the Joint Commission report on its work so that the Soviet Union and the United States can immediately discuss taking steps conducive to completing the Moscow resolution."

　　维护三外长会议对朝鲜决议
  　莫洛托夫驳马歇尔
    【新华社陕北二十六日电】据塔斯社莫斯科二十四日讯：苏联外长莫洛托夫顷就朝鲜苏美联合委员会工作问题答复美国务卿马歇尔八月十二日致莫洛托夫照会。复文中详述苏联政府对联合委员会如何与朝鲜各党派及社团协商成立临时政府一事之见解。莫洛托夫首先就那些党派社团可以参加协商一事，驳复马歇尔，马氏曾要求朝鲜“民主”党派及社团应获得“最广泛之可能参加”，意即什么党派社团都可以参加。莫洛托夫驳称：“联委会之协商对象，为完全支持莫斯科会议关于朝鲜决定之各民主党派与社会团体。对于“反莫斯科托管决议委员会”所属之党派团体，只有在与上述委员会断绝关系并声明退出后，始能允许其参加协商。苏联坚持与朝鲜民主党派团体广泛协商，但不欲与仅拥有数十或数百会员之团体协商。因为这类团体颇多，并缺乏权威，如与之协商，不仅难于收效，且将拖延联合委员会工作，使朝鲜临时政府之成立延迟。苏联政府认为：“会员超过一万人之党派团体方能被邀参加协商。”其次关于朝鲜人民表示意见之自由，马歇尔曾空言“不应受任何限制。”莫洛托夫复称：“协商时发表意见之自由，不应受到限制一项，此种待遇首先应赋于坚持实现莫斯科决议之诸党派团体。然而，最近在朝鲜南部，支持莫斯科决议之各党派团体已遭美当局最严厉之限制与迫害，此举实违背民主原则且与莫斯科会议背道而驰。这些党派团体的房舍被警察占据，其领袖及会员被逮捕，并封闭其出版机关；苏联政府认为此种情势，不能加以容忍。此种迫害行为若不立即全部终止，势必阻碍莫斯科三外长会议关于朝鲜决议之真正执行。”最后，关于委员会报告工作问题，莫洛托夫表示同意马歇尔之建议称：“苏联政府不反对由联合委员会报告工作情形之建议，以便使苏美两国立即讨论采取有利于完成莫斯科决议之步骤。”
