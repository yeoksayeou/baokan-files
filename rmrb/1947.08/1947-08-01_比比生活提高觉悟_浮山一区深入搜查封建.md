Compare Lives to Raise Awareness
	Floating Mountain District One Deeply Searches for Feudalism
	[This newspaper's Taiyue dispatch of the 30th] Floating Mountain District One implemented "Compare Lives, Search for Feudalism," further deepening land reform. After the county town was liberated, the district generally carried out land reform. In early June, because the peasants were busy with the summer harvest, the focus of work temporarily shifted. Now, entering land reform again, most district and village cadres felt that there was no profit to be made or not much. In order to make the cadres deeply understand the landlords, the leadership especially emphasized comparing their lives with the landlords. Each village, with poor and hired peasants as the main body, held comparison meetings. Each administrative village in Zhongcun selected one household of a landlord who had been "overthrown" in the past and one poor peasant household to compare. The landlord's family of three still had 28 mu of good land. This time, the wheat harvest was five shi, they lived in good houses, the woman wore fine cloth clothes, and they served guests with two plates of dishes. However, the widowed old woman Bai Fengjiang did not receive anything during the emancipation and is still starving. The landlord Bai Qingcheng in Xitai, who had been struggled against twice, still has 10 mu of land in the gullies, 2 mu of paddy fields, 6 mu of medium-quality land, 3 cave dwellings, and has bought half a cow. The emancipated peasant Chen Jinyu said: "It is said that the tiller has his own land, but ten poor people cannot match one overthrown landlord." Therefore, feudal forces are still rampant. The carpenter Lao Tai from Zhongcun walked down the street and retreated three steps when he saw the landlord Chen Dianqing sitting in front. When the peasants in Wucheng Village held a meeting, the landlord dared to throw bricks inside. In Dong’erli, a tenant farmer was insulted by the landlord while working on the land he had been allocated. In many villages, after the struggle, landlords cursed people indirectly, oppressing the peasants so that they could not raise their heads. After such comparisons, the cadres in each village suddenly realized and were determined to lead the masses to completely eliminate feudalism. According to the investigation, the main reason why feudal forces still occupy a dominant position in the district is that the backbone role of poor and hired peasants was ignored, and the struggle was not thorough enough. The poor peasant Guo Deren said: "Every time we struggle, we say it is not thorough enough, but they say it is almost enough. We say we want our blood and sweat money, but they insist on leaving it for the landlord." The leadership composition of Matai Village is mostly middle peasants, who restrain the actions of poor peasants everywhere. The activist Chen Jinyu said angrily: "The middle peasants took the decree to leave the landlords a middle peasant life, which really kills people." Secondly, the classification of classes is unclear, and feudal forces pretend to be middle peasants, taking the opportunity to infiltrate the "Emancipation Association" and seize leadership. The village head and deputy secretary of a certain village are both rich peasants, the vice chairman of the peasant association and the chairman of the military committee are bankrupt landlords, and three of the four standing committee members are wealthy middle peasants. Among the cadres in the whole village, except for one poor peasant and one demobilized soldier, the rest are feudal elements. Thirdly, the simple emphasis on speed resulted in a superficial approach, and the peasants were still not mobilized. Zhongcun contacted 92 people in two days and one night and immediately carried out the struggle, resulting in the feudal forces also being contacted, and feudal rich peasants were regarded as the basic masses, so many landlords and rich peasants drilled into the peasant association.

    比比生活提高觉悟
    浮山一区深入搜查封建
    【本报太岳三十日电】浮山一区实行“比比生活搜查封建”，进一步深入土地改革。该区在县城解放后，即普遍进行了土地改革。六月初因农民忙于夏收，工作中心暂时转移，目前又进入土改，一般区村干部思想上多感觉没油水或油水不大。为了使干部深刻认识地主，领导上特别强调与地主比比生活。各村以贫雇为主体，召开了比一比会，中村行政村每一村抽一户从前所谓“斗倒”了的地主和一户贫农比较，地主三口人，仍有二十八亩好地，此次麦子就打了五石，住着好房子，女人穿着细布衣服，待客是两个盘子。而孤寡老婆白凤江在翻身中却未分得任何东西，现在还饿着肚子。×台地主白青成，曾经过两次斗争，现在三口人仍有十亩漫沟地、二亩水地、六亩中等地、三孔窑，并买了半头牛。翻身农民陈金玉说：“说起来实现了耕者有其田，可是十户穷人也顶不上一户斗垮了的地主”。因此封建势力仍然嚣张，中村木匠老泰走在街上，看见地主陈殿卿在前面坐着，便退后三步。武程村农民开会，地主还敢往内丢砖头。东二里一个佃户在他分得的地里劳动，被地主侮辱。不少村子斗争后地主指鸡骂狗，欺压得农民不能抬头。这样比较之下，各村干部才恍然大悟，决心领导群众，彻底消灭封建。该区封建势力还占统治地位的原因，据调查主要是因为忽视了贫雇农的骨干作用，斗争不彻底。贫农郭德仁说：“每斗争一次，咱说不彻底，人家说差不多了。咱说要血汗钱，人家偏给地主留下”。马台村领导成份大部是中农，处处牵制贫农行动。积极分子陈金玉气愤的说：“中农拿了给地主留中农生活的法令，真把人制死了。”第二划分阶级不清，封建势力混充中农，乘机混入“翻身会”，掌握领导。某村村长、村副书记均是富农，农会副主席、武委会主席是破落地主、四个常委中即有三个富裕中农，全村干部中除一个贫农与一个退伍军人外，其余均为封建成份。第三单纯的强调快，因而水过地皮湿，农民仍然没有发动起来。中村两天一夜即联络了九十二人，马上进行斗争，结果把封建势力也联络上了，把封建富农当作了基本群众，所以许多地主富农钻入了农会。
