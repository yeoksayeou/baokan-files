　　Several Senior Officials of UNRRA China Office
  　Oppose Stopping Relief to Liberated Areas
    [Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 11th] According to a Shanghai dispatch from the Associated Press on the 5th, the unreasonable measure of UNRRA to stop relief to the Liberated Areas has also aroused opposition from some senior officials of the UNRRA China Office. In their private conversations, these officials said: The cessation of relief supplies to the North China war zone is mainly used to deal with the areas controlled by the Communists, and this action openly mixes politics with relief. They believe that this policy of UNRRA violates basic fairness, which will deprive an estimated 90 million people (Note: actually 131 million people) of relief supplies, while the Nanjing area will receive a steady supply. They said: UNRRA's explanation for the suspension – that the Chinese government (referring to the Chiang government) no longer protects distribution activities in the war zone – is untenable, because UNRRA's designated relief to the Communist areas has been severely obstructed by the government (referring to the Chiang government) in various ways for months. UNRRA has never accepted the Communists' request to directly transport relief supplies to the ports controlled by the Communists, as they advocated. UNRRA would rather transport equipment and materials planned for distribution to the northern region (referring to the Liberated Areas) piecemeal by difficult and slow boats and vehicles. The Associated Press said: These officials will submit a protest letter against UNRRA's decision, but in order to "avoid the unease of policy makers," the protest letter will be submitted secretly.

　　联总中国分署若干高级官员
  　反对停止救济解放区
    【新华社陕北十一日电】据合众社上海五日消息：联总停止对解放区救济的无理措施，亦引起联总中国分署若干高级官员的反对。这些官员于其私人谈话中说：救济物资停止运往华北战区，主要系用于对付共产党控制区，这种行动公然使政治与救济相混合。他们认为联总此种行动方针是违反起码的公平的，这将使估计达九千万人民（按：实际是一万万三千一百万人民）得不到救济物资，而南京地区则源源得到供应。他们说：联总对于停运的解释——由于中国政府（指蒋政府）不再保护战区的分配活动，这种说法是讲不通的，因为联总指定的对共产党地区的救济，数月来就一直受到政府（指蒋政府）种种动行的严重阻挠。联总从来没有允纳共产党之请求，如他们所主张的一样，将救济物资直接运入共产党控制的港口。联总宁愿零星地以艰难而缓慢的舟车来运输计划要分配与北部地区（指解放区）的装备物资。合众社称：这些官员将对联总决定提出抗议书，但他们为了“避免制定政策的人员的不安”，抗议书将秘密提出。
