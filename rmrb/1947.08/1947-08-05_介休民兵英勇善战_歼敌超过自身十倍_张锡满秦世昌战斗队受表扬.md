    [This dispatch from our Taiyue office on the 2nd] In the patriotic self-defense war of the past year, the militia combat teams of Zhang Ximan and Qin Shichang in Jiexiu have created a brilliant record of annihilating more than ten times their own number of enemies. At the district commendation meeting, they were praised as first-class heroes. These are just small guerrilla groups of around twenty-five men. Zhang Ximan's combat team, from July of last year to now, has killed, wounded, or captured 224 enemies, disintegrated 170 enemies, and seized 4 machine guns, 2 small cannons, and 72 rifles. Qin Shichang's detachment, only from January of this year, has killed, wounded, or captured 113 enemies, seized 3 small cannons, 1 grenade launcher, 2 machine guns, and 40 rifles. They have only suffered one death and two serious injuries. The reason they have been able to achieve such an amazing record is that they have the masses working with them in reconnaissance and combat, enabling them to obtain real intelligence and win every battle. For example, when Zhang Ximan's combat team annihilated the "Homecoming Corps" artillery squad in Beizhai Village, an old woman provided the reconnaissance information. Qin Shichang's combat team excels at "winning by surprise," while Zhang Ximan excels at winning over and disintegrating the enemy. Qin Shichang annihilated the "Good People Corps" in Liutun, the center of the five strongholds of Zhaoshan, Gucun, Zhangqiu, Xishui, and Shitun, creating the "tiger digging out the heart" tactic. Zhang Ximan used "heart-winning work" to disintegrate more than 170 members of the "Good People Corps" in three villages.
    [This dispatch from our Taiyue office on the 2nd] The militia of Linfen and Fushan, who are besieging the Chiang troops in Linfen, jointly crushed over 60 Chiang and puppet troops who had launched an offensive. On the 21st, more than 60 Chiang and puppet troops from Xiwang Village in Linfen, carrying machine guns, went to Xu Xin, Guibian and other villages to loot grain. Upon hearing the news, the Linfen Third District combat team and the Fushan expeditionary team rushed to the scene and surrounded and fiercely attacked the enemy from the north and south. Machine gunner Qiao Dingmen alone killed or wounded 7 enemies. Seeing that the situation was not good, the enemy fled in panic. Our militia pursued closely, and at Beiwang Village, the enemy fell into our minefield again. With a loud explosion, another 3 enemies were killed or wounded. In this battle, a total of 12 enemies below the rank of squad leader were killed or wounded, and the looted grain and clothing were recovered in full.

    介休民兵英勇善战
    歼敌超过自身十倍
    张锡满秦世昌战斗队受表扬
    【本报太岳二日电】介休张锡满和秦世昌的民兵战斗队，在一年来爱国自卫战争中，创造了歼敌数目超过自己十倍的光辉战绩。在分区功臣大会上，被誉为一等功臣。按他们均不过是二十五人上下的小组游击队，而张锡满战斗队从去年七月到现在，已毙伤俘敌二二四名，瓦解敌一七○名，缴获机枪四挺，小炮两门，步枪七二支；秦世昌的分队，仅从今年一月起，即毙伤俘敌一一三名，缴获小炮三门，掷弹筒一个，机枪两挺，步枪四十支。他们仅有一人阵亡，二人负重伤。他们之所以能获得如次惊人战绩，是因为他们有群众和他们一起侦察，一起战斗，能得到真实情报，每战必胜。如张锡满战斗队在北寨村歼敌“还乡团”小炮班时，是一个老太太给侦察的情况。秦世昌战斗队在战术上长于“出奇致胜”，张锡满长于争取瓦解敌人。秦世昌曾在照山、孤村、张秋、西水、石屯五据点中心的刘屯歼敌“好人团”，创造了猛虎掏心战术。张锡满用“攻心工作”，来瓦解敌三个村的“好人团”一百七十余人。
    【本报太岳二日电】围困临汾蒋军之临汾、浮山民兵，联合击溃出犯之蒋伪军六十余人。二十一日，临汾西王村蒋伪军六十余名，携带机枪向徐新、归编等村抢粮。临汾三区轮战队及浮山远征队闻讯赶至，南北两路将敌包围痛击，机枪射手乔丁门一人即毙伤敌七名。敌见势不佳，狼狈逃窜，我民兵紧紧追击，至北王村，敌复陷我地雷阵中，一声爆炸，又毙伤敌三名。是役共毙伤敌分队长以下十二名，被抢之粮食、衣物如数夺回。
