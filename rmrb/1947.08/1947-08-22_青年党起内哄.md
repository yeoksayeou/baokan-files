Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 20th: The Qingdao Dazhong Daily revealed: Since the political beggar Youth Party begged for leftover scraps, they have been in constant internal strife due to uneven distribution. At the secret Central Executive Committee meeting held in Shanghai in mid-June, they quarreled fiercely, fiercely attacking Li Huang for grabbing the position of "Minister of Economic Affairs" but not taking office; many who gathered in Nanjing in an attempt to obtain an official position were very dissatisfied that the Youth Party only held the two ministries of Agriculture and Economy. Furthermore, Zuo Shunsheng and Chen Qitian are also very distressed, because after the new officials took office, they only had empty titles, and the leftovers were limited, not enough to distribute to everyone, and they were subject to attacks within the party. In addition, the party is currently rushing to create a roster in preparation for participating in the puppet National Assembly and puppet Legislative Yuan "elections." All the male and female servants of the party's key members have been absorbed into the party. It is said that after joining the party, there is hope of being promoted to "adjutant" in the future. Currently, the party is engraving more than 6,000 wooden seals in order to create a list of party members.

　　青年党起内哄
    【新华社陕北二十日电】青岛大中报透露：政治乞丐青年党自乞得冷饭残羹后，因分食不匀，时起内哄。该党于六月中旬在沪秘密召开的中执委会上，吵得一塌糊涂，对李璜抢了“经济部长”一职又不就任一事大肆攻击；许多聚集南京企图获得一官半职者，因未能如愿，对青年党仅执掌农、经两部甚不甘心。而左舜生、陈启天亦很苦恼，因新官上任后徒有虚名，所得冷饭残羹有限，不敷一一分配，备受党内攻击。又，该党刻正赶造名册，以备参加伪国代、伪立委“竞选”，该党各要员之男女仆役已全数被吸收入党，据云入党后将来即有升充“副官”希望，目前该党正刻制木章六千余颗，以便制造党员名册。
