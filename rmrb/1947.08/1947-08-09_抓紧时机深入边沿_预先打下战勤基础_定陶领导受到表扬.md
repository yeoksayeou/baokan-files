[This report from our newspaper in the Jilu豫 area, dated the 6th] Dingtao seized the opportunity in the guerrilla war environment, attacked the enemy, opened up the situation, consolidated the central area, and provided strong assistance to the conscription and land reform in the central area, laying a very good foundation for war support work in the border areas. For this reason, it was commended at the county secretary joint meeting held by the Fifth Prefectural Committee in mid-July. According to Dingtao County, there are a total of ten districts. Except for the Huangdian (part), Rannan, and Ranbei districts, where more than 100 villages in the central area have been reviewed, the remaining seven districts have two districts fallen into enemy hands, and five districts are guerrilla areas. In these seven districts, only the activity method of armed work teams can be adopted. According to the principle of "what is lacking, distribute what is lacking", land reform is carried out village by village. When the county party committee discussed how to closely integrate war support and land reform, it came to the conclusion that adhering to the central area is passive, the enemy can harass at any time, which will affect the conscription work in the central area, and the war support task will come soon, the new area has no foundation and cannot bear it, if all pressure is put on these three districts, the conscription work will be impossible. Therefore, it was decided to transfer the troops to the enemy's heart area in the North Fifth District, to do what the enemy hates most, so that the enemy is caught in parrying and unable to look south, which indirectly shelters the conscription movement in the central area. It was decided to concentrate forces to open up the North Fifth District, and transfer the county team with a part of the militia to the opening area. After mobilization, the soldiers were in high spirits. It set off on June 20, and fought six battles in five days, killing more than 50 enemies. The enemy's morale was low, and the eastern half of the North Fifth District was under our control. In order to consolidate the eastern part and further liberate the western area, we continued to attack the enemy, so we took the initiative to attack the enemy. After a few victories, the enemy dared not confront us head-on, and abandoned the heart area to disrupt our central area. However, after being blocked by the militia, the enemy retreated in panic. At this time, the situation in the North Fifth District was opened up. After the aftermath work, the masses had a preliminary understanding, and a large-scale war support task came, and the North Fifth District was successfully completed. The masses in the central area also actively joined the army. In the close combination of war support, land reform, and conscription production, the leaders also distinguished the importance of the tasks, clarified the specific division of labor, and had certain people responsible for war support, land reform, and conscription. The main person in charge focused on strengthening each urgent work and mastering the overall situation. In the area, similarly, some areas were responsible for war support, while other areas continued to work as usual. In the areas responsible for war support, time was squeezed to combine with land reform. On the one hand, they drew a certain number of people to be responsible for land reform, on the other hand, they mobilized troops to help land reform, and formed stretcher bearers and porters into civil transport teams, using the space of war support and the porters that could not be used up in one battle to carry out land reform in the stationed villages. After three days, the situation in Dingtao County was opened up, and land reform was carried out in 20 villages in the suburbs of the city. The masses were in high spirits to participate in the war. In this war support task, Dingtao not only had a scientific division of labor and a precise combination, but also saved a lot of civilian labor in war support. For example, in the past, the grain and firewood required by the troops were generally apportioned and concentrated in one place, and then distributed to various troops. This wasted a lot of resources back and forth. This time, a method of local supply was created. After the battle, adjustments were made, or the next war support was placed in other areas, saving the trouble of transportation and manpower.

    抓紧时机深入边沿
    预先打下战勤基础
    定陶领导受到表扬
    【本报冀鲁豫六日电】定陶在游击战争环境中，抓紧时机，出击敌人，打开局面，巩固了中心区，予中心区的参军土改以有力援助，为边沿区的战勤工作打下了很好的基础。为此，在上月中旬五地委所召开的县书联席会议上受到了表扬。按定陶全县共十个区，除黄店（一部）冉南、冉北三个区百余村庄为中心区进行了复查外，其余七个区有两个区沦于敌手，五个区是游击区。在这七个区里，只能采取武工队的活动方式。根据缺啥分啥的原则，一村一村进行土改。在县委会上讨论如何使战勤土改紧密结合时，得出这样的结论：固守中心区是被动的，敌人可以随时袭扰，会使中心区的参军工作受到影响，且战勤任务很快就来到，新区没有基础，担负不起来，若全部压到这三个区，参军工作便无法进行。因此，决定将队伍调到北五区敌人心脏地区，搞敌人最痛的地方，使敌人陷于招架，无法南顾，这样便间接的掩护了中心区的参军运动。决定集中力量开辟北五区，将县队配合一部民兵调到开辟区，经过动员，战士情绪很高。于六月二十号出发了，五天打了六仗，打死敌人五十余名，敌人士气低落，北五区的东半部为我控制。为了巩固东部和进一步解放西部地区，继续向敌人进攻，遂主动向敌人出击。打了几次胜仗，敌人不敢与我正面对峙，而放弃心脏地区，向我中心区扰乱。但经民兵阻击，敌人即慌张退去。这时，北五区的局面打开了，进行善后工作后，群众初步有些认识，大规模的战勤任务到来，北五区胜利的完成了。中心区群众亦踊跃参军。在战勤土改参军生产精密结合中，领导上又分别了任务的轻重，明确具体分工，战勤土改参军均有一定的人负责，主要负责人有重点的加强每一紧急工作，和掌握全盘。在地区上，同样一部分地区担任战勤，其他地区仍照常工作，而在担负战勤的地区，挤空结合土改。他们一方面抽出一定人负责土改，一方面动员部队帮助土改，并将担架民夫组成民运组，利用战勤空间和一次战斗用不完的民夫在驻村搞土改。经过三天时间，定陶县城打开局面，进行了城郊地区二十余村的土改，群众参战情绪很高。在这次战勤任务中，定陶除科学的分工，精密的结合外，并在战勤上节省了许多民力。如过去都是将部队需用的粮柴普遍的摊派集中到一个地点，然后再分发各部队，这样一来一往，有不少浪费，这次创造了就地供给的办法，战斗结束后，再作调剂或下次战勤放到别区，节省了运输的麻烦和人畜力。
