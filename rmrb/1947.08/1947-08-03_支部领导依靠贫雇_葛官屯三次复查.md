    Branch Leadership Relies on Poor and Lower-Middle Peasants
    Three Re-examinations in Ge Guancun
    [This Dispatch from our newspaper in the Hebei-Shandong-Henan Border Region, dated 31st] Renping's Sixth District, Ge Guancun, under the leadership of the branch and relying on the poor peasants, and uniting with the middle peasants, carried out a third re-examination. This village is a relatively old and advanced village, with 160 households. In the previous two re-examinations, more than 700 mu of land and more than 200,000 jin of grain were uncovered; but after the movement, the landlord Wang Qiyu pretended to be a middle peasant and infiltrated the Farmers' Association, and sent his daughter-in-law to infiltrate the Women's Association. During this discussion on re-examination, the landlord incited several people who had gained more benefits, saying: "When will the struggle be over? It's almost done." The others remained silent. In mid-June, the county committee came to the village to hold a branch meeting for education. This further deepened everyone's understanding of the landlord's crimes, and they all came forward to recount their sufferings. After the party members' thinking was cleared, they unanimously decided to re-examine. Then it was proposed that it would not work if only we are doing it, because there are too few people. So it was decided to convene a meeting of poor peasants to recount their sufferings and compare their lives with the landlords, one by one. They also compared who had been overturned the most, and all felt that they had not been thoroughly overturned. At this time, everyone's enthusiasm rose, and they felt that it must be done. It was also proposed that our strength alone is limited, and we must unite the middle peasants to participate. Therefore, it was decided to convene a general meeting of all members. The next day, more than 500 people discussed in groups. Poor peasants were dispersed and inserted into each group to guide the recounting of suffering. For a time, the whole place was in an uproar, and model squads were immediately sent to control all 21 landlords. The next day, the branch led another frankness and unity meeting. Enthusiastic criticism and self-criticism and self-reflection were carried out, and the unity between cadres and the masses was further strengthened. Then, they took action. As a result, more than 200 mu of land, more than 40,000 jin of grain, six carts, and more than 200 pieces of clothing were uncovered.

    支部领导依靠贫雇
    葛官屯三次复查
    【本报冀鲁豫三十一日电】荏平六区葛官屯由支部领导，依靠贫农，并联合中农，进行第三次复查。该村是工作较老的先进村，有百六十户，前两次复查中，搞出土地七百多亩，粮食二十多万斤；但运动过后，地主王七狱冒充中农混入农会，并派他儿媳妇打入妇会。在这次讨论复查中，地主挑拨几个得果实较多的人说：“斗争何时算完，差不多了。”其他的人便不吭气。六月中，县委到该村召开了支部大会，进行教育。使大家进一步认识了地主的罪恶，纷纷起来诉苦。党员思想打通后，一致决定再复查。遂又提出光咱这些人还不行，人太少了。于是又决定召集贫农来开会，进行诉苦，并与地主比生活，一个一个的比了一遍。又比了比谁翻的怎样，都感到没翻透。这时，大家的劲头起来了，非干不行。又提出光咱这伙人力量有限，还要团结中农参加，于是决定召开全体会员大会。第二天，五百多人分组讨论。贫农分散插到各组，引导诉苦。一时全场轰动起来，当即派模范班把二十一个地主一齐控制起来。次日，支部领着又开了个坦白团结大会。热烈进行了批评与自己的坦白反省，干群之间进一步团结，接着便行动起来。结果清查出土地二百多亩，粮食四万多斤，大车六辆，衣服二百多件。
