    Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, August 26th: London dispatch: British Trade Minister Stafford Cripps recently delivered a speech, urging the people to increase production to overcome Britain's economic difficulties. Cripps stated: Britain's economy is facing danger. Today, the urgency of Britain's struggle to achieve import-export balance (note: Britain's current annual import surplus reaches 700 million pounds) is like the military situation before the landing in Europe. Cripps asked the British people to lower their living standards and increase production. Cripps believes the main reasons for the economic difficulties are: (1) The shortage of domestic manpower, transportation, and steel hinders the development of production; (2) The widespread poverty and lack of purchasing power in the world affect the British overseas market.
    Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, August 28th: Paris dispatch: French Foreign Minister Georges Bidault declared in the National Assembly on the 26th: Europe has encountered an economic crisis that already exists, and pointed out: "France is facing poverty, and its gold reserves can only purchase the main imported grains needed for two months."
