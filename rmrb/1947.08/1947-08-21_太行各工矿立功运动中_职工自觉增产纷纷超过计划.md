　　In the Taihang industrial and mining enterprises' merit campaign,
  　Workers consciously increased production, exceeding plans
    [Our Dispatch] Under the call of "Production and Thrift" and "Support the Front Lines," factories, mines, and post offices in Taihang launched a fervent campaign to earn merit for the people. This movement, based on the democratic movement in factories, implemented mutual benefit for labor and capital, gradually developing from the ideological awareness of "workers loving factories and factories loving workers." In the past six months, inspired by this movement, every worker and staff member has invested the greatest enthusiasm in production. Ren Ligong, a 68-year-old worker at the Xinhua Textile Factory, whose family had been emancipated and whose two sons had joined the Eighth Route Army, with his third son working in the factory, voluntarily proposed to the factory: "Although I am old and cannot operate the looms, I can still mend cloth and help the factory with sales. I want to dedicate my old life to earning merit for the people!" Director Zheng of Supply Department No. 1 Factory even personally participated in production for three hours every day to ensure that the clothing tasks assigned by superiors were completed on time, with guaranteed consistent color and thirteen stitches per inch. Workers at the Huafeng No. 1 Factory, after setting their production increase and merit-earning plans, worked hard every day to rush the installation of machinery, even sacrificing sleep, but their morale remained high. They managed to install two machines within five days. Others, such as Wang Tonghe and Li Bingqian, workers in the iron workshop of the No. 5 Factory, persisted in working despite being ill; Sun Xuecheng, a worker injured beside the hammer furnace, returned to production as usual before his injuries had fully healed. Such a surge in merit-earning production enthusiasm enabled the creativity of each worker to be fully unleashed. Liu Jingwen, a worker at the Jia Zhang Coal Mine, after careful research, replaced the large baskets on the coal mine's coal-lifting machine with cylindrical cans and used automatic iron hoppers at the bottom, which saved a worker at the top. Also, using a weight-operated well cover at the top, with one person opening and one person pouring coal, also saved one worker. Calculating this way, 500 dan of rice could be saved in a year. Senior worker Chen Chuan of the mine spun his own thread, saving 480,000 yuan at a time. Waterworks workers also made many innovations. In terms of using machine oil, the result of one month of the merit campaign was a reduction from 35 jin to 10 jin, and improvements are continuing. Many factories have also launched friendly revolutionary competitions in the merit-earning production campaign. Changzhi Huaqiang Factory took the lead with the inspiring slogan "Those with merit add merit without pride, those without merit quickly earn merit without discouragement," challenging the workers of Sheng, Yihecheng, No. 11 Alley Textile Factory, Leather Factory, and Huafeng Factory, and proposed their own increase production targets: Huaqiang would weave 425 bolts of cloth per month (25 feet per bolt), Huasheng Factory would produce 2,075 dozen socks, 325 vests, and 500 blankets per month, and would also ensure high quality and low prices in the finished products, while the factory guaranteed an adequate supply of raw materials. After the "August 1st" production inspection, each factory exceeded its production plan in the heated competition: the Zhenhua Craft Cooperative's soap exceeded the original plan by 12 percent, and increased production by 60 percent compared to before the movement; Huaqiang exceeded the plan by 18 bolts in just twenty-four days; the Xinhua Paper Mill exceeded the original plan by 75 percent; the Huasheng Factory exceeded it by more than one time; the Bomb Institute increased its output by 80 percent compared to the past, and ensured that none of the bombs failed to detonate; the Jingfang Mine exceeded the plan by 80 percent; the Jia Zhang Coal Mine completed its task 20 days ahead of schedule, with an increase of 11 times compared to last year. Other factories such as the Printing Factory, the Gexin Factory, and the Yimin Factory also exceeded their increased production plans ahead of schedule. In particular, the postal workers and staff in the Taihang counties, under the slogan of earning merit for the people, changed from a every-other-day system to a daily system, accelerating the delivery of letters and newspapers in various places. Taking newspaper distribution alone: in the past, it took three days for newspapers to be sent from the General Bureau to Zuoquan, now it takes two days; it took three days to Changzhi, now it takes one and a half days; it took eight days to Qinxian, now it only takes four days. With such a doubling or tripling of delivery speed, twenty counties in Taihang have effectively guaranteed the timely supply of spiritual food for the cadres and masses throughout the region.

　　太行各工矿立功运动中
  　职工自觉增产纷纷超过计划
    【本报讯】太行各工厂，矿山与各邮局工人和职员，在“生产节约”“支援前线”的号召下，开展了热烈的为民产功运动。这一运动，是在工厂民主运动的基础上，实行了劳资两利，逐渐作到“职爱工，工爱厂”的思想自觉而开展起来的。半年来，在这一运动的鼓舞下，各个工人和职员，都把最大的热情投入了生产。新华纺织厂六十八岁的老工人任立功，他家是翻身户，二子参加了八路军，三子在工厂工作，他向工厂自动提出：我虽老了，不能上机织布，但我还可以整布，还可以替工厂去推销，我要以我这条老命，去为民立功！供给部一厂郑厂长，更亲自动手每日参加生产三小时，要保证作到上级给的服装任务按时完成，而且保证颜色一样，每寸保证缝到十三针。华丰第一厂工人，自订出增产立功计划后，每天紧张的赶装机器，连晚上觉都不能够睡好，但他们的情绪仍然很高，在五天之内即赶装出两部机器。其他如五厂铁工部工人王同和、李丙乾虽然带病，仍然坚持工作；在拉锤炉旁受伤的工人孙学成，伤还未愈，又照常参加生产了。这样高涨的立功生产情绪，就使各厂每个工人的创造性充分发挥出来，贾掌煤矿工人刘景文，经细心研究后，把煤井机上上煤的大篓改成圆罐，下边用自动铁簸箕，即可省下一个挂顶工人，上边用坠子井盖，煤上来一人开口一人倒，也可省一个工，这样合计下来，一年可省米五百石。该矿老师傅陈川，自己纺织线绳，一次即可节省四十八万元。自来水工人也有许多创造，他们在使用机器油方面，一个月立功运动的结果，即由三十五斤减少到十斤，目前正在继续改进。许多工厂在增产立功运动中，更开展了友谊的革命竞赛。长治华强工厂首以“有功者功上加功不骄傲，无功者赶快立功不灰心”的鼓动口号向盛、义合成、十一闾纺织厂、皮革厂、华丰等厂工人挑战，纷纷提出自己增产的数目：华强每月要作到织布四百二十五匹（每匹廿五尺），华盛厂要作到每月出袜两千零七十五打，背心三百廿五打，毛毯五百条，在成品上并要作到物美价廉，厂方则保证作到原料充足。“八一”生产检查后，各厂在火热的竞赛中，都超过了生产计划：振华工艺社肥皂已超了原定计划百分之十二，比运动前增产百分之六十；华强仅二十天四超过计划十八匹；新华造纸厂超过原定计划百分之七十五；华盛厂更超过一倍；炸弹所比过去数目增产百分之八十，在质上作到了没有一个不炸的，经坊矿超过百分之八十，贾掌煤矿提前完成任务二十天，较之去年增产量多十一倍，其他如印刷厂，革心厂，益民等厂都提前超过了增产计划。特别是太行各县的邮局职工，在为民立功的口号下，由隔日制改为逐日制，加速了各地信件书报的传递，单以报纸发行来说：过去由总局寄左权须三天，现在即两天；到长治须三天，现在即一天半；到沁县八天现在只须四天。这样寄递速度增加一倍到两倍的，太行已有二十个县，有力的保证了全区干部群众精神食粮的及时供给。
