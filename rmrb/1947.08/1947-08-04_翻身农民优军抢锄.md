[Reported by this newspaper from Southern Hebei on the 1st] Before "August 1st" (Army Day), the masses in Ji County, Zaoqiang, and Wuyi actively helped military families with weeding. Labor hero Yu Luoshan from Xisha Geda took the lead in weeding for military families, urging everyone to weed for military families as carefully as they would for their own fields. Liu Bin weeded for Liu Jingzhen so thoroughly that not a single weed was left, delighting Jingzhen's wife who said, "In previous years, my field was full of weeds, but this year, the seedlings are thriving." An old man of seventy-two from Xibei Dike went to the village office on his own initiative, asking to weed for military families. The village deputy said, "You are too old; we have young and strong people." But he refused to give up, wanting to compete with the young people, saying, "I am old, but I have more experience." Finally, he weeded for military families twice alongside the young people. Children in Guowei not only weeded for military families twice but also picked vegetables for them. When the village cadres of Wangjia Cliff led the masses in weeding for military families, the martyr's family member Wang Lishu said with joy, "It is right for my son to shed blood fighting old Chiang, but for everyone to help us with farm work, I really feel indebted." The military families wrote to their children, telling them that there was food and firewood at home, urging them to kill the enemy and make meritorious contributions.

[Reported by this newspaper from Lincheng] After the liberation movement, the peasants of Lincheng cherish their army even more, and preferential treatment for military families has become a mass movement. During the rush to plant, sow, and replant, the work of military families was always done first. Various agencies, schools, local troops, and merchants also generally helped military families with farming during the busy agricultural season. After a rainfall, the Heicheng Cooperative automatically dispatched four mules and one donkey to help military families with planting. The sub-district hospital sent manpower and livestock to help the anti-Japanese families of Hao Village with replanting. Some convalescing comrades, despite their unhealed wounds, also volunteered to help military families with replanting. Zhao Shengping, the political director of Hao Village, organized a shock team to replant for military families, and he rubbed his shoulder raw while pulling the plough. Yang Laian, the political director of Zhao Village, led the youth to weed for military families during the lunch break. Under the leadership of Director Feng, all cadres of the Public Security Bureau used their lunch break to weed nineteen mu of millet and eight mu of sorghum twice for military families. The grateful military family member Wang Duoyu said, "I will definitely write about this to my husband." (Jin Tang)
