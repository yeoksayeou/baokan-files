　　Shahe Ferry Village Achieves Great Success in Production and Famine Preparation
　　Seedlings Weeded Three Times, Evaluation of Merits and Selection of Models
　　[Report from our Correspondents on the 15th] Shahe Ferry Village has launched a mass patriotic labor campaign to promote production and prepare for famine, achieving great success. After the soldier Shi Yucheng from the village performed great service at the front line, the village chief Peng Lian seized the opportunity of the whole village hanging a plaque for Shi Yucheng's family, and the masses admiring the meritorious soldiers and their high morale, and called on everyone to earn merit through production. Although the masses recognized the glory of earning merit, they felt that it was a matter for heroes and cadres, and that they could not earn merit themselves. Some said, "The army earns merit at the front, under gunfire. What merit can we farmers earn?" They did not understand what exactly counts as earning merit. The leadership, through various channels, repeatedly explained that men should fight drought and prepare for famine by carrying water and planting seeds, and women should work hard at spinning and weaving, saving money and food. "As long as you do good deeds, it counts as earning merit." Some of the masses began to accept this, and the idea began to brew in the process of production and labor. When repairing the river beach water channel, Shi Laijin was unwilling to go, so the cadres said to him, "It's so dry, how can you earn merit if you don't repair the beach?" He said, "If the cadres say I can earn merit, I'll go right away!" So he ran to the river beach to carry stones, picking up the big ones to carry, and was very active. The leadership used this example to educate everyone that "this is earning merit" and called on the whole village to learn from him. The masses had a further understanding of earning merit, and an atmosphere of learning and hard work permeated the whole village. At this time, the leadership further led the formulation of a production and famine-relief merit plan, with mutual aid groups and households as units, determining the goals for each person's struggle, and conducting a mass inspection after each agricultural stage. With a clear direction, everyone strove to be strong, and the whole village has now preliminarily completed the production plan set by the village chief of the village—Peng Lian, a model cadre of the Taihang District—at the hero meeting. The grain has been weeded four times (it rained earlier in the village), 60 loads of manure have been applied to the watered land, 30 loads of manure have been applied to the dry land, more than 100 mu of beach land has been repaired, 206 mu of indigo have been planted, and 500 mu of cotton have been planted, all watered and planted by hand. Various sideline occupations have earned a profit of 11 million yuan. After saving and bartering for food, the entire village of 1,600 people saved more than 15,000 jin of rice in 50 days, and used the income from sideline occupations to buy grain. Currently, there are 35,000 jin of wheat and more than 5,000 jin of rice stored as famine reserves. After weeding the third time, taking advantage of the gap before weeding the fourth time, the whole village held a commendation and evaluation of merits. First, reports were made within the mutual aid groups, with self-reports and recommendations (others reporting for him). After discussion and approval by everyone, the reports were submitted to the Merit Evaluation Committee. Some who believed they had merit but were not approved by the group reported themselves at the village meeting, and the whole village discussed. The Merit Evaluation Committee was elected by each group and was responsible for reviewing the evaluation, submitting the results to the village mass meeting for final decision. This time, 106 people in the whole village were recognized as having performed meritorious service, and another 25 people received verbal praise. After the evaluation of merits, the morale of the whole village was even higher. In the dining halls and on the ridges of the fields, people were talking about earning merit everywhere. A patriotic labor plan to "make a final effort to strive for a good harvest this autumn or a smaller crop failure" is brewing. (Kui Lin, Li Zhuang)

　　沙河渡口村生产备荒成绩大
  　苗锄三遍评功选模
    【本报记者团十五日电】沙河渡口村，开展群众性的立功运动，推动生产备荒，成绩甚大。该村战士石玉成，在前线立了大功，村长彭连抓住全村给石玉成家挂匾、群众羡慕功臣、情绪高涨的机会，号召大家生产立功。群众虽然认识了立功光荣，但觉得那是英雄、干部的事，自己立不了功，有的说：“军队在前方，枪炮底下立功。咱庄稼汉还立个啥功。”不了解究竟怎样算作立功。领导上通过各个系统，再三解释，男人们抗旱备荒挑水点种，女人们勤劳纺织，省吃俭用，“只要作了好事，就算立功。”部分群众，开始接受，并在生产劳作的过程中酝酿起来。修河滩水渠时，石来金不愿去，干部就向他说：“天旱成这样，你不去修滩怎么立功呢？”他说：“干部们说能立功，我马上去！”于是跑到河滩里抬石头，拣大的抬，非常积极。领导上用这个例子，教育大家“这就是立功”，号召全村学习他。群众对立功有了进一步的认识，学好努力的空气，弥漫全村。这时领导上进一步领导订定生产渡荒立功计划，以互助组和户为单位，确定每个人的奋斗目标，每到一个农事段落，即进行一次群众性的检查，努力的方向有了，人人争强，全村现已初步完成该村村长——太行区模范干部彭连在群英会上订的生产计划。谷已锄过四遍（该村下雨较早），水地上粪六十担，旱地上粪三十担，修滩地百余亩，种蓝二○六亩，棉花五百亩，都是担水点种的。各种副业已获利润一千一百万元，节约换饭后，全村一千六百人，五十天省米一万五千多斤，并以副业收入买粮，现存下三万五千斤麦子，五千多斤米，以作备荒之用。锄完第三遍苗，乘着不久要锄第四遍苗的空隙，全村举行表功评功，先在互助组内报告，自报和举荐（别人替他报），经大家讨论通过后，报告到评功委员会，有些自己认为有功而小组未通过的，则在全村大会上，自己报告，由全村群众讨论。评功委员会由各组选出，负责复评，把结果提交全村群众大会，由大会作最后决定。此次全村被公认立功者一○六人，另有二十五人，受到口头表扬。经过评功，全村情绪更高，饭场上，地堰边，随处都在谈论立功问题，一个“最后鼓一把劲，争取今秋不歉收，或少歉收”的立功计划，正在酝酿中。　（奎林、李庄）
