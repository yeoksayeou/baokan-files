    Gleanings from the Chiang Kai-shek Area
    △ Over a Thousand Chiang Kai-shek Generals Weep at Sun Yat-sen's Mausoleum!
    Non-direct line generals, purged by Chiang Kai-shek to eliminate dissidents, were mostly sent to the Central Training Corps for training. They said: The Central Training Corps is a concentration camp, where they can't even get enough to eat. According to a report in the Nanjing Salvation Daily on July 5th: "A few days ago, over a thousand generals from the Central Training Corps lined up to weep at Sun Yat-sen's Mausoleum, shouting slogans like 'Revolutionary comrades unite!' and 'If the government wants us to live, it should give us a bowl of rice; if the government wants us to die, it should also give us a coffin!'"
    △ Chiang's Officials' "Theory of Rapid Defeat":
    For half a year, the People's Liberation Army has advanced with irresistible force, conquering every place it attacks, and winning every battle it fights. Chiang's officials are panic-stricken and extremely anxious. Senior officials have transported their families to the rear, so that they can easily escape when our army arrives. According to a revelation in the Nanjing Salvation Daily on July 6th, Chiang's officials have completely lost confidence in the war. Zhang Jiaquan, the director of the Second Department of the Beiping Pacification Headquarters, said: "The Communist army is determined to launch a full-scale general counter-offensive on August 1st, which will force the Nationalist army to concentrate in large cities and gradually annihilate them." He also said: "It is expected that it will take sixteen months for the Communist army to complete the annihilation of the 'Nationalist army' from the general counter-offensive." After this defeatist made his pessimistic remarks, the people of Beiping and Tianjin felt even more uneasy, and prices soared daily. Chiang's officials are all in a state of panic, seeing ghosts in the trees and hearing enemies in the wind.
    △ Crushed His Own Son to Death Due to Life's Pressures
    According to the Henan Republican Daily on May 20th: The wife of Hu @yao Jun, a section chief in the Henan Provincial Government's Statistics Office, was overwhelmed by the continuous price hikes in the city. Hu's monthly salary was not enough to pay the rent, and there was no way to think about living expenses. As a result, the family often ran out of food, and she suffered great mental stimulation. A few days ago, while Hu was at work, she violently crushed her three-year-old son to death on the ground. The scene was extremely tragic. When Hu returned home from work, he was heartbroken at the sight, and he has been absent from work for several days due to a nervous breakdown.
    △ Civil Servant Commits Suicide Due to Destitute Life
    Taipei, June 11th dispatch: Chen Bowen, a staff member of the Taipei Municipal Government, was unable to cope with the pressures of life and was unable to seek medical treatment for his own illness. A few days ago, he received a letter from his wife at home, learning that there was no grain left in the house. He was forced to become disillusioned with the world and committed suicide on the 14th by jumping off a train in the northern suburbs of the city. (Compiled by Hu Yusheng)

    蒋区拾零
    △蒋家千余将官哭陵！
    被蒋介石排除异己的非嫡系将官，多被送入中训团受训，他们说：中训团就是集中营，在里面连吃饭都吃不饱。七月五日南京救国日报讯：“前几天中训团将官千余人列队哭陵并高呼口号‘革命同志团结起来’，‘政府如果要我们生存，应给我们一碗饭吃；政府如果要我们死亡，也应给我们一口棺材’。”
    △蒋家官员的“速败论：”
    半年以来，人民解放军势如破竹，攻无不克，战无不胜，蒋家官吏肉跳心惊，惶恐万状，高级官员均将眷属运送后方，以便我军一到易于逃跑，据南京救国日报七月六日透露蒋家官吏对战争信心全失，北平行辕第二处处长张家铨称：“共军决于八月一日为全面总反攻，势将迫国军集中大城市予以逐渐消灭”。并说：“共军从总反攻到消灭‘国军’预料共需时十六个月完成。”这位败论家发表悲观谈话后，平津人心更感不安，物价日趋暴涨，蒋家官员均陷风声鹤唳草木皆兵之惶恐状态。
    △生活压迫摔死亲生子
    河南民国日报五月二十日讯：豫省府统计室主任科员胡＠尧君之夫人，以本市物价连续暴涨积压于胸，而胡君月入薪俸，全数不足以偿房租，生活费用更无处着想，因之家中时常断炊，精神上大受刺激，日前乘胡军上班致将其三岁幼子在地上用力摔死，其状至惨，迨胡君下班后，目睹心伤，神经失态现已废公数日矣。
    △生活无着公务员自杀
    台北六月十一日通讯：台北市政府职员陈伯稳为生活压迫并自身患病无法就医，日前接家中其妻来信，获悉家中粒米均无，遂迫使其厌世于十四日在市郊北自火车上跃下自杀。（胡玉生综编）
