　　A Certain Brigade in the Taiyue Area Complains, Investigates Ideology:
　　Recognizing the Landlord Class as the Enemy
    [Our Newspaper, Taiyue, 19th Dispatch] A certain brigade of the local armed forces, in the process of investigating class and ideology, recognized the landlord class as the enemy. Soldiers of the Seventh Company generally reflected on their actions. Zhao Heyun said: "We didn't treat the landlords as enemies, but the landlords treated us as enemies. When the troops were resting in Anyi, it was during the Dragon Boat Festival. As usual, each company invited the landlords to dinner. The landlord of the Seventh Company headquarters, surnamed Li, was a landlord and put on the airs of a wealthy man. We couldn't get him to come no matter how many times we invited him. At the time, we were confused and sent him two bowls of pork buns. In the afternoon, we sent him two more bowls of sugar cakes. This landlord hypocritically accepted them. The next morning, we found out that they had fed the buns and sugar cakes to the dogs. Aren't you angry?" From these facts, the soldiers of the whole company recognized that the landlords were our mortal enemies. One soldier said: "The landlords are really hateful. They fed our good food to the dogs. They are real cannibals and bloodsuckers. We must overthrow these bad guys." In the artillery company's complaints, the soldiers helped each other to clarify their thinking. They said: "The landlords don't treat us like human beings. This time, we must pour out our grievances." Zhao Xiao, who did not dare to complain before, also told the story of how his mother and son were forced to beg for food at the conference, which moved everyone to complain.

　　太岳某旅诉苦查思想
  　认清地主阶级是敌人
    【本报太岳十九日电】地方兵团某旅，在查阶级查思想中认清地主阶级是敌人。七连战士普遍作了反省，赵和云说：“我们不把地主当敌人，地主把我们当作敌人。队伍在安邑休整时，正是端阳节，和往常一样，各连请房东吃饭。七连连部的房东姓李，是地主，摆着财主的臭架子，几次请不到，当时还糊涂，给人家端了两碗猪肉包子送去，下午又送去了两碗糖糕，这地主故作虚伪的收下了。第二天早晨，我们发现人家把包子和糖糕都喂了狗，你们说气人不气人？”从这些事实，全连战士认清了地主是我们的死对头。一个战士说：“地主真可恶，拿我们的好吃东西喂了狗，真是吃人精，吸血鬼，一定要打倒这些坏蛋。”迫炮连在诉苦中，战士们互相帮助打通思想，他们说：“地主不把咱当成人，这回要吐吐冤气。”连不敢诉苦的赵小也在大会诉出他母子被迫讨饭的深冤，激动了全场纷纷诉苦。
