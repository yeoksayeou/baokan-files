　　Xinhua News Agency, Northeast, 23rd—Chiang Kai-shek's puppet bandits and special agents have been gradually eliminated in the Northeast Liberated Areas over the past year. According to the Public Security Bureau of the Northeast Administrative Committee, as of now, more than ten war criminals and traitors who were Japanese offenders, including Yamamoto Ningji, the agent of the Fengtian Special Service Agency, and those above the level of puppet provincial governor, have been punished. More than sixty riots jointly organized by Chiang and Japan have been suppressed, the largest of which involved three thousand people. The entire or part of Jiang Pengfei's 27th Army, etc. has been cracked down. More than eighty Chiang bandit brigade commanders and more than one thousand eight hundred battalion commanders have been captured, and three thousand five hundred Chiang bandits have surrendered (the above figures do not include the results of military bandit suppression). Forty-four American-style secret radio stations have been seized. From October of last year to August of this year, in Harbin alone, more than one thousand four hundred major special agents were uncovered, including one hundred and fifty-two professional special agents, nine hundred and seventeen bandits, eighty-six war criminals, thirty-three traitors, and two hundred spies. All kinds of firearms confiscated and searched included ten light and heavy machine guns and one thousand four hundred and fifteen long and short guns. Note: These bandits, except for a few professional special agents trained by the US and Chiang, were mostly policemen, ruffians, and remaining special agents from the puppet Manchurian regime. After the "August 15th" surrender of the Japanese bandits, they were bought by Chiang Kai-shek in large numbers, and "underground armies," "maintenance societies," and party headquarters were established everywhere. Colluding with war criminals, they carried out armed attacks, looted cities, instigated riots and assassinations, and disrupted the democratic order of the liberated areas. By December of last year, more than ten thousand people had been successively wiped out by the military and civilians in various places, and their organizations had basically disintegrated. Some fled into the Chiang Kai-shek puppet area, and some went into hiding, colluding with landlords, or pretending to be enlightened, to undermine land reform. At the end of this spring, a thorough re-examination and digging-up-bandit-roots movement was launched in various places, and the original forms of the bandits and special agents were fully exposed, and they were uncovered one by one by the masses and the government.
