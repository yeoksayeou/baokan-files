    Establishing Poor Peasant Backbone
    In-depth Review in Tielu Village

    [This newspaper's report from the Hebei-Shandong-Henan Border Region, 1st] Tielu Village in the fourth district of Qingfeng was a progressive village during the War of Resistance. After the land reform, the cadres believed it was thorough, but after in-depth understanding by district cadres, the problems of the poor peasants were not resolved. Although the poor peasant Zhao Jindo was allocated three mu of land, he didn't even have a sickle and found everything difficult. An old woman hadn't had a quilt for four years and hadn't received anything. After landlords Li Haizhi, Li Wuzhou, and Li Wufan were struggled against, they told their sons to infiltrate the public-owned stores and use their "worker family" status to ask the masses for care, giving them work and land to cultivate. Li Wuzhou had a family of five. When he was struggled against, he kept eighteen mu of land, and later, because he was a "worker family," he was given an additional five mu. Once, Li ×× was using livestock to thresh wheat when he was stopped by the wife of landlord Li Wufan, who said, "Unload it, I am a military dependent, I should thresh first." At the same time, landlord Li Haizhi infiltrated the Farmers' Association, posing as a poor peasant representative, and even used the lackey Li Jizeng to carry out sabotage. After in-depth investigation by the district cadres, after being exposed at the branch and village cadres meetings, it was decided to review. However, because middle peasants accounted for the majority of the village cadres, some cadres considered it to be settling personal grudges during the masses' accusations, restricting the activities of the poor peasants, resulting in the gradual decline of the poor peasants' morale. The next day, a meeting of cadres and party members was convened. After enlightenment and education, everyone examined why the cadres were not enthusiastic at the accusation meeting. The director of the Women's Association reflected and said, "I can't be ruthless towards the landlords. I don't believe the poor peasants' accusations of such suffering. In fact, a well-fed man doesn't know what it's like to be hungry." Some also reflected, "Now I have everything, and I can't get more from the things I got from struggle." Everyone examined that because the cadres were mostly from middle peasant backgrounds, they did not personally experience the suffering of the poor peasants, their spirit of serving the poor peasants was not enough, they were selfish, and in some places they even lost their standpoint. After the examination, everyone decided to transform their thinking, resolutely serve the poor peasants, and decided to establish a poor peasant group, establish poor peasant leadership, and establish a review committee dominated by poor peasants, unite with the middle peasants, and face the landlords. Then the landlords were detained to clarify the boundaries between landlords and peasants, and the leadership resolutely supported the poor peasants, the masses' morale was high, and first conducted accusations, and pursued hidden wealth. Through the mass activities of the poor peasants, the cadres' past understanding that the poor peasants were helpless, "should be poor," "backward" and other understandings were changed, and they more deeply realized that the poor peasants are the main force of the review.

    树立了贫农骨干
    铁炉庄复查深入
    【本报冀鲁豫一日电】清丰四区铁炉庄在抗战时是进步村，土改后干部认为彻底了，但经区干深入了解，贫农问题未解决。贫农赵金斗虽然分了三亩地，但一把镰刀都没有，啥也作难。一个老太婆四年没盖过被子，一点东西没分到。地主李海芝、李五洲、李五范被斗后，叫儿子钻入公营商店，以“工属”资格要群众照顾，给他们作活种地。李五洲五口人，被斗争时留下十八亩地，后来因是“工属”又补五亩。一次，李××套着牲口正碾麦，被斗地主李五范老婆拉着牲口说：“卸下来，我是军属，应该先碾。”同时，地主李海芝混进农会，冒充贫农代表，更利用狗腿李记曾进行破坏。经过区干深入调查，在支部、村干会上揭发后，决定复查。但由于村干部中中农占多数，在群众诉苦中，部分干部认为是报私仇，限制贫农活动，以致贫农情绪渐渐低落。第二天，召集干部党员会议，经过启发教育，大家检讨诉苦大会中干部不起劲为啥？妇会主任反省说：“俺对地主狠不下去，贫农诉的那样苦，俺就不相信，其实是饱汉不知饿汉饥。”也有的反省：“我现在啥都有了，斗出来的东西也得不到多些。”大家检讨出因干部中农出身多，没有亲身体会贫农痛苦，为贫农服务精神不够，自私自利，有些地方且失掉立场。检讨后，大家决定改造思想，坚决为贫农服务，并决定建立贫农小组，树立贫农领导，成立以贫农为主的复查委员会，联合中农，面向地主。接着把地主扣押起来，划清地主和农民的界线，领导上并坚决给贫农撑腰，群众情绪高涨，首先进行诉苦，追浮财。经过贫农的群众活动，转变了干部过去认为贫农没办法，“该穷”“落后”等认识，更深刻认识了贫农是复查的主力。
