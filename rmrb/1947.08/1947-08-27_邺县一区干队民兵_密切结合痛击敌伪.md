　　Yexian County First District Cadre Team Militia
  　Closely Combines to Vigorously Strike Enemy and Puppet Forces
    [This newspaper's Yexian dispatch] On the morning of the 7th of this month, after breakfast, enemy and puppet Chen's troops, in coordination with a portion of the puppet township government, totaling more than 200 people, invaded our Dugu Village in the First District of Yexian County to seize conscripts and rob grain. More than 40 militiamen and district cadres from our First District advanced from the west of the enemy, firing volley guns at the enemy. A small number of militiamen on the front also charged towards the enemy. The district team fiercely swept the area with machine guns, and the surrounding militiamen fired their guns together. The enemy, seeing the situation was not good, suspected it was our regular troops and fled in panic. We pursued and vigorously attacked, wounding seven enemies (including four seriously wounded and four slightly wounded). Our First District militia fought more than ten battles around August, capturing alive eleven enemy and puppet soldiers and wounding more than ten, for a total of twenty-eight enemy soldiers wounded and captured. The morale of the militiamen is very high, and they are actively operating against the enemy. (Excerpt from Yexian Report. Wu Fen Wu)

    【本报邺县讯】本月七号早饭后，有敌伪陈部配合伪乡公所一部共二百余人，进扰我一区杜固村抓丁抢粮。我一区民兵区干队四十余人，从敌西面插去，用排子枪向敌发射，正面有少数民兵也向敌冲去，区队用机枪猛烈扫射，周围民兵一齐发枪。敌看势不好，疑是我正规部队，惊慌逃窜。我追赶痛击，打伤敌七名（内有三重伤四个轻伤）。我一区民兵八月前后战斗十数次，活捉敌伪十一名，打伤十余名，共计打伤俘敌二十八名，民兵们情绪十分高涨，正在积极向敌活动。（邺县汇报摘录。五分武）
