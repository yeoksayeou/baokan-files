Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 27th. Tianjin News: Mr. Li Zhuchen, Chairman of the Tianjin Industrial Association Branch, telegraphed Chiang Kai-shek on the 23rd, expressing deep dissatisfaction with his decision to open trade with Japan, which violates the interests of China's national industry. Li said: "Recently, there have been reports of a large number of smuggled Japanese goods appearing on the market, revealing the menacing resurgence of dumping aggression. Once trade with Japan is opened, the disaster of smuggling and dumping will inevitably become even more severe than before the war." Li requested the dismantling and relocation of Japanese textile, rayon, alkali manufacturing, and other industrial equipment to reduce Japan's industrial power and use it to supply the needs of China's civilian industry.

　　李烛尘电斥蒋介石不满开放对日贸易
    【新华社陕北二十七日电】天津消息：天津工业协会分会理事长李烛尘氏，二十三日电蒋介石，对其违反中国民族工业利益，决定开放对日贸易一举，表示深刻不满，李氏说：“最近走私日货市面传有大量发现，倾销侵略之重来，显已露其凶锋，将来对日贸易一经开放，其走私倾销之祸，较之战前必更变加厉。”李氏要求拆迁日本纺织、人造丝、制碱等工业设备，以减低日本工业力量，而用以供应中国民间工业之需要。
