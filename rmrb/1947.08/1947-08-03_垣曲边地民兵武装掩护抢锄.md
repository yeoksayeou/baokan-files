    Yuanqu Border Region Militia
    Armedly Escorts Hoeing
    [Our Taiyue Dispatch, 1st] The masses in the Yuanqu border region, under the slogan of "holding a gun in one hand and a hoe in the other," are not only rushing to hoe seedlings but also engaging in armed struggle against the enemy. The four eastern villages, including Tanjiacun, have organized war support mutual aid groups. When the enemy doesn't come, they rush to hoe seedlings. When the enemy comes, a portion acts as cover in the front, and another portion transforms into transfer teams, immediately moving people and livestock to the rear. After the enemy leaves, they return to the village to rush to hoe seedlings. Within four days, they hoed 1,200 mu of late autumn crops and completed the second hoeing of early autumn crops. Shangqi Village and Shangxia Chengpo organized all able-bodied, semi-able-bodied women, and children to go to the fields together. Under the vigilance and cover of the militia, they hoed more than 5,000 mu of millet and corn in three and a half days. They also carried out irrigation and drought resistance in each canal, while the guarding militia in the front repelled several enemy intrusions to loot grain. On the 17th of last month, two companies of the puppet Third Security Regiment, with one cannon and one heavy machine gun, came to the Tanjiacun area to loot grain. The guarding militia gave them a painful blow. Sharpshooter Zhao Zhongqi killed the enemy Yan Shaosheng with one shot, and also killed and wounded two other enemies. The enemy was unable to withstand the attack and retreated in a panic, with no losses on our side.
    [Our Dispatch] The stubborn puppet troops in Huolu, while constantly looting grain, have also begun their brutal conscription activities. The enemy in Nantongye has already demanded soldiers from each village. Eight soldiers are required from Xiguozhuang village alone. Those who refuse to go are forcibly arrested. In order to survive, the masses are carrying out struggles to protect grain and preserve conscription quotas everywhere. The enemy's 10th Security Column in Nantongye, combined with a unit of the Home Return Corps of about 200 people, surrounded the northern and southern old villages of our region at dawn on the 9th of this month, attempting to loot grain and seize conscripts. This was detected by our militia in advance, and they immediately launched a battle. In less than fifteen minutes, a unit of our First District Youth Team rushed to support. The village joint defense militia, who were hoeing seedlings, heard the gunfire and dropped their hoes to come to support, giving the enemy a severe beating, killing two and wounding three. The enemy, frightened, fled back. We suffered no casualties, victoriously striking a blow to their activities of looting grain and seizing conscripts. The County Command issued a commendation order and awarded the village joint defense militia a merit citation.
    [Another Dispatch] More than ten members of the Yuanshi Fourth District cadre team, led personally by the branch secretary, launched a surprise attack on the stubborn puppet troops stationed in Quancun on the evening of the 7th of this month, eliminating the sentries of the puppet Nanzuo Township Home Return Corps, killing three on the spot, capturing one, and seizing four rifles and more than forty bullets. The enemy was extremely panicked and fired a burst of shots. We suffered no casualties and returned safely after completing the task. (Jixi Minbao)

    【本报太岳一日电】垣曲边地群众在“一手拿枪一手拿锄”的口号下，一面突击锄苗，一面与敌进行武装斗争。谭家村等东四村组织战勤互助组，敌人不来就突击锄苗，敌人来了一部分在前面掩护，一部分变为转移小组，马上将人、牲口转移到后边。敌人走了又回村突击锄苗，在四天内锄完晚秋一二○○亩，又将早秋二遍锄完。上七村、上下橙坡，组织全半劳力妇女、小孩一齐上地，在民兵警戒掩护下，三天半锄谷、玉茭五千余亩，各水渠并进行浇苗抗旱，同时前面警卫民兵打退敌人数次抢粮进犯。上月十七日伪保三团二个连附炮一门、重机枪一挺，到谭家村一带抢粮，警卫民兵予以痛击。神枪手赵中强一枪击毙敌阎绍生，并毙伤敌二名，敌不支狼狈败退，群众毫无损失。
