Concentrate All Efforts on Increasing Food Production, Consistently Practice Thrift and Implement Famine Preparedness!
	Emphasizing Both Production Increase and Thrift
	Lucheng Vigorously Prepares for Famine

[From Our Newspaper in Lucheng] The great battle of the entire Lucheng county to combat drought and rush planting has been completely victorious, with all autumn seedlings in place. Currently, the second great battle is underway, namely, protecting seedlings, increasing production, practicing thrift, and preparing for famine, and preliminary results and experiences have been achieved: 1. Focus on Key Areas. In the entire village, identify the best seedlings and areas with water availability, then organize a large-scale labor exchange to focus on watering those areas. The village designated over seven *qing* of land as seedling protection zones. Thirty-seven old wells and twenty new wells, each well can water more than one *mu* of land per day. Xiwang designated over eight *qing* of land as seedling protection zones, and four people can dig a well in four days. In the Sanqu Silianshan Dihehou and other nine villages, 947 *mu* were top-dressed, accounting for 28.7% of the original cornfields. The method is a combination of watering, top-dressing, and piling soil. Mix manure in water, half a bucket of manure water for each corn seedling, is equivalent to a thorough rain. All manure buckets were organized, with livestock pulling and people carrying, women digging ditches, children pouring manure water, and men piling soil. The masses happily sang to the watered seedlings: "I saved you, and you saved me." After detailed calculation, each *mu* can increase production by two *dou*. A bonus system was established in seedling watering to increase the enthusiasm for seedling protection labor exchange. In the designated seedling protection area, the yield per *mu* is estimated according to the year's harvest. The increased yield due to watering and top-dressing is then distributed among the participating labor force. 2. Returning to Wheat Stubble Land, Rushing to Replenish Planting, Increasing Production. At the "July 1st" Conference, the county party committee called on everyone to increase food production to support the front lines. Cadres and the masses established a food concept, extensively returned to wheat stubble land, seized grain, and expanded wheat fields by 50%. Under this call, the masses actively responded to the party's call. On July 2nd, after a two-finger rain, villages seized the opportunity to return to planting and replenish planting. According to statistics from the Second District, over 40,000 *mu* of beans, over 9,000 *mu* of millet, over 30,000 *mu* of black beans, and over 3,000 *mu* of mung beans were planted on wheat stubble. Now the seedlings are all in place, and the masses happily said: "We have won another victory." 3. Sideline Production is Even More Active. Following the Hundred-Day Weaving Movement, another Sixty-Day Weaving Movement has begun. Women are determined not to sell cotton but to sell cloth, and they are turning the cotton they have grown and stored at home into cloth to exchange for food. Statistics from Xin'an and other 34 villages show that 515 people and 658 animals participated in transportation 75 times, earning over 6 million *yang*. Cooperatives also actively organize local goods for export in exchange for grain. 4. Under the slogan of "Increase Production First, Thrift Second, Seize the Positive Aspects," villages are carrying out the production increase movement while also not relaxing thrift. People are universally recalling the suffering of the 1943 famine and the experience of fighting the drought. Every household is counting their possessions and making plans. In Zaozhen, men and women have launched a thrift competition. Men give women advice not to leave leftovers at every meal, and women give men advice not to smoke cigarettes. Thrift has become a universal action. (Chen Zhenhua)

    潞城大力备荒
    【本报潞城讯】潞城全县抗旱突击下种的大战斗已经完全胜利，秋苗齐全，现正进行着第二次的大战斗，即保苗增产节约备荒，且已取得初步成绩与经验：一、重点主义。在全村范围内那一片苗最好，那一片有水浇的条件，即全村组织大变工，突击水浇那一片。该村划定七顷多地的保苗区，三十七眼旧井，廿眼新井，每眼井每天能浇一亩多地。西旺划定八顷多地的保苗区，四个人四天能打一眼井。三区四联防山底河后等九个村，即上追肥九百四十七亩，占原有玉茭地的百分之二十八点七。办法是水浇、上追肥、搂圪堆三样结合，把圊粪拌在水内，一棵玉茭苗用半筒水粪，就顶下透了雨。将所有的粪筒组织起来，牲口拉的拉，人担的担，妇女挖圪道，小孩倒水粪，男人搂圪堆。群众对着浇过的苗高兴的唱着我救活了你，你也救活了我。经详细计算每亩可多增产量二斗，浇苗中规定分红制度，提高保苗变工情绪，在划定的保苗区内，将每块每亩按年成作产量，因水浇上追肥而多增的产量，再以参加的劳动力来分红。二、回茬麦地、突击补种、多增产量。“七一”大会县委号召一切为着多增加粮食支援前线，干部群众树立粮食观念，大量回茬麦地，抓取粮食，扩大麦田百分之五十。在这号召下，群众积极响应党的号召，七月二日降二指雨，各村即抓紧时机进行回茬、补种。根据二区统计麦地回茬豆子四万余亩，黍米九千余亩，黑豆三万余亩，绿豆三千余亩。现在苗已齐全，群众高兴的说：“我们又打了一次胜仗”。三、副业生产更加活跃。紧接着百日纺织运动过后，又来个六十日纺织运动。二、三十妇女们抱着不卖棉花要卖布的决心，把家里种的存的棉花，都要做成布来换粮食。辛安等三十四村统计，参加运输人五一五个，畜力六五八头，运输七五次，共赚洋六百余万元，合作社也积极的组织本地货出口换回粮食。四、各村在增产第一，节约第二，抓紧积极面的口号下，一面开展增产运动，同时也不放松节约。普遍的回忆四三年灾荒饿的痛苦及向旱灾作斗争的经验。户户算家当、家家订计划。枣臻男人妇女提出节约竞赛，男人给妇女提意见，每顿不留剩饭，妇女给男人提意见不吸纸烟。节约成为普遍行动。（陈振华）
