Xinhua News Agency, Northeast, 5th. During the Democratic Allied Forces' summer offensive, the Chiang Kai-shek Ministry of National Defense's "Joint Logistics Headquarters Electric Code No. 400832" exclaimed in alarm: "The ammunition situation has reached an extremely difficult state." Another document, numbered "Qinqi 448658," admits that the Chiang army's weapons and ammunition were captured in large quantities by the People's Liberation Army. It states: "Units close to the war zone often lack contact with nearby supply depots, so in emergencies, when units retreat (note: i.e., flee), the weapons and ammunition stored in the supply depots are all abandoned, and most of the custodians are captured by 'bandits' (referring to the People's Liberation Army)."

    蒋记国防部供认
    大量武器落入我手
    【新华社东北五日电】民主联军夏季攻势中缴获蒋记国防部“联勤总部电器四○○八三二号代电”中惊叫：“目前弹药已达极端困难境地。现在编号为“勤器四四八六五八号”之另一文件中，则供认蒋军武器弹药被解放军大量缴获。内称：“接近战区之部队，往往与附近兵站械库缺乏联系，故遇情况紧急，部队转进时（按：即逃跑），则兵站械库屯备之械弹，即被悉数遗弃，保管人员并多遭‘匪’（指解放军）俘”。
