　　How I Led New Comrades in Combat
  　A Self-Account by Mu Jiucheng
    Illustration by Ma Da
    Editor's Note: Comrade Mu Jiucheng is the Deputy Squad Leader of the Machine Gun Squad of the First Platoon of the Fifth Company of the Second Detachment of the Wu River. He was liberated in the Pinghan Campaign and joined our army. Because of his good leadership in two defensive blocking battles, he was twice elected as a combat hero. His self-account is published here for our readers.
    　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　
    　　　　I. Defending the Fortifications
    The enemy started shelling the positions of the Fourth Company, both on the mountain and in the village, from Dawa Li in the southwest corner of Bai Si. The new recruit Li Yunxian kept shrinking down in the fortification, and then his whole body started to tremble. I knew he was scared, so I calmly told him:
    “What are we afraid of in the fortifications? In the fortifications, we only hear the noise, but there's no danger.”
    He was skeptical, straightened up a bit, but his whole body was still trembling. I told him again:
    “It's okay in the fortifications, you can lie down and rest.”
    “I don't want to lie down.”
    “If you don't want to lie down, then observe the enemy from this gun emplacement, and tell me when they come so we can fight.” I found him a gun emplacement where he couldn't see the enemy yet, and instructed him this way.
    After waiting for a while, Li saw the enemy moving towards us in the distance through the gun emplacement. "Deputy Squad Leader, they're coming! I saw the enemy lying in the open field in front of us through the gun emplacement." I still patiently told him: "Don't panic, they're far away. Wait until they get to the bridge before we shoot." Zhang Deli also chimed in, "They're too far away. When we fought at He Cang, we didn't shoot until they were over 200 meters away. We can shoot accurately when they get closer. The Fifth Army has planes, tanks, and artillery that are much more powerful than this. The Deputy Squad Leader is good at fighting!"
    In a little while, machine guns, rifles, and platoon mortars all fired at once. Li Yunxian started trembling again in the fortification. Under these circumstances, I was originally very anxious and wanted to get angry, but then I suddenly realized that he was a new recruit, so I patiently continued to explain: "Look, Zhang Deli is so young and he's not afraid. He was also afraid of the artillery when he first came, but now he knows that it can't hit you in the fortifications. He has experience, so he's not afraid." Then I told them how to avoid the enemy's shells: "If you hear the shell whirring... it must be landing far away, don't worry about it. If you hear a 'squeak...' then lie down quickly, it must be landing very close."
    After my various explanations, Li Yunxian's fear seemed to have diminished a little. He wasn't shrinking down as much, and he wasn't trembling. After another short while, he mumbled to himself, "There are three people, but only one machine gun. Two of us don't have any weapons." It was clear that he wanted a weapon. I was happy and immediately took out two hand grenades. Before they even reached the ground, Li Yunxian reached out and grabbed one. He was very happy and proud. Seeing that Li Yunxian knew how to grab hand grenades, I became even more confident, and immediately said to them, "The three of us all have weapons now. We'll use the machine gun when they're far away, and the hand grenades when they're close. No matter what, you two must follow me closely and don't get lost." Li Yunxian also said to Zhang Deli, "Deputy Squad Leader, don't worry, I'll follow you wherever you go." As soon as he finished speaking, Li Yunxian heard the Fourth Company's position erupt in a cacophony of shouts and screams, with machine guns and hand grenades going off all at once. "Deputy Squad Leader, listen to the shouts over there..." I immediately explained in a very flexible manner: "What are you afraid of the shouts for? Maybe it's our Fourth Company launching a counter-attack against the enemy. Stay calm, it's getting dark, and the enemy won't be able to do anything when it's dark." Before I finished speaking, I glanced out of the corner of my eye at the village's northeast, where troops were coming from the detachment headquarters. I was even happier and immediately changed the subject, saying, "Zhang Deli, Li Yunxian, look, aren't those our troops, reinforcements are here! What's there to be afraid of? We'll definitely wipe out these guys tonight." I pointed with my finger, very happy. Li Yunxian's face also started to show a smile.

    　　　　II. A Victorious Attack
    The enemy broke through the Fourth Company's position, occupied the mountain, and entered the village. It was already dusk. Instructor Han led our company around the corner of the mountain to attack the enemy on the mountain from their flank and rear. After a brief mobilization, the troops began to move. I accepted the task and, as we walked, whispered to Zhang Deli and Li Yunxian to encourage them: "Let's see who earns merit this time, who can become a hero. The enemy attacked us during the day, and we're going to attack them at night. You two mustn't get lost at night. As long as you follow me, there's no danger."
    During the movement, a shell suddenly came over, and Li Yunxian ran a few steps in panic and lay down in fright. I said, "Didn't I tell you? The three of us will live and die together. As long as we walk close to the side, we'll be fine." After a while, he saw a wounded soldier from the Fifth Squad and he was so frightened that he lay down and didn't dare to move. I said, "I'm still in front of you, if anyone gets hit, I'll be the first. What are you afraid of? Just keep a low profile." As we approached the foot of the mountain, the enemy sentry discovered us and opened fire. The troops followed closely and rushed up. We captured a prisoner halfway up the mountain. The enemy was scattered by our swift movements. They were whistling and shouting, some even mistaking us for their own people coming to make contact. "Li Yunxian, Zhang Deli, listen, the enemy has all run away. Our instructor even captured a prisoner! Listen to how high the guns are shooting." Li Yunxian originally didn't know whether the bullets being fired were high or low, but after rushing up, he didn't see anyone in our company get injured. Instead, he saw the captured prisoner, saw me exposing half of my body to fire the machine gun, saw that everyone was full of energy, and heard me saying as we walked, "If you're not fast, you won't earn any merit. Don't get lost. As long as you give me the oil I need, you'll complete your mission." At this time, his morale also rose: "Deputy Squad Leader, don't worry, I guarantee I won't get lost."
    As we rushed up the mountainside to the downhill area, we saw the enemy gathering in a large pit. I raised my hand and fired a burst from the machine gun, shouting, "Li Yunxian, shoot quickly!" There was a bang in the pit, and the enemy fled. We rushed down and captured several prisoners, seizing two cannons (one was an 82mm mortar) and more than 3,000 rounds of ammunition. We chased for more than two li. The hand grenade that Li Yunxian grabbed played a big role in the above captures. On the way back, some carried prisoners, and some carried the cannons. Li Yunxian carried the ammunition, and as we walked, he kept saying, "Squad Leader, that hand grenade was thrown by me!" (Attached picture)

    The sound of gunfire filled the air, and Li Yunxian was so scared that he trembled. I gave him a hand grenade to boost his courage.

    Seeing me fire the machine gun, exposing half of my body, and seeing that everyone was full of energy, his morale also rose.

    I raised my hand and fired a burst from the machine gun. There was a bang in the pit, and the enemy fled.

　　我怎样带领新同志作战
  　穆九成自述片断
    殷红记  马达插图
    编者按：穆九成同志系乌江二分队五连一排机枪副班长，平汉战役被解放过来参加我军，因两次防御阻击战，带领新战士作战好，两次当选为战斗英雄，兹将其自述发表于此，以响读者。    　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　
    　　　　一、守工事
    敌人在白寺西南角上大洼里，朝四连的阵地山上山下及村子里开始打炮了，新兵李允贤在工事里身子光往下缩，以后竟然全身哆嗦起来。我知道他在害怕了，马上自己很沉着的告诉他：
    “咱们在工事里怕啥？在工事里是光听响没危险。”
    他半信半疑，挺了挺身子，还是全身哆嗦。我又告诉他：
    “在工事里没关系，你躺下休息吧。”
    “我不躺。”
    “你不躺就在这个枪眼里观察着敌人，来了告诉我打。”我给他找了个还看不见敌人的枪眼，这样吩咐他。
    等了一会，李在枪眼里看见敌人远远的向我运动。“副班长，来啦！我从枪眼里望见敌人却在前边野地里卧着。”我仍耐心的告诉他：“别慌，远着哩，到桥口再打。”张德立也插嘴说：“太远啦，我们在何苍打仗时，二百多米达还不打哩，近了打的可准啦，五军有飞机坦克大炮比这厉害得多，副班长打仗可行啊！”
    一小会机枪、步枪、排子炮响成一个，李允贤又在工事里哆嗦起来，在这种情况下，我本来很着急，就想开始发脾气，这时忽然脑子一活显想到他是新兵，于是又耐心的说下去：“你看张德立这样小就不害怕，以前他刚来时也是怕炮，现在他知道在工事里打不着，有经验就不怕了。”接着又告诉他俩怎样躲避敌人的炮弹：“你听炮弹若咒……一定落得远，别管他。你若听吱……就赶快卧到，一定落很近。”
    经过我各种各样的解释，李允贤害怕好象减少了一些，不往下蹙了，不哆嗦了。又一小会他一个人嘴里又咕哝起来：“三个人就是这一挺机枪，俺两个人没有。”这显然是他想要这武器，我高兴了马上把蹩的两个炸弹掏出来，还没有到地下，就被李允贤伸手抢去了一个，他得意洋洋的高兴了。我一看李允贤知道抢炸弹，自己更有了信心，又马上对他俩说：“咱们三个都有了武器，远了咱们用机枪，近了咱们用炸弹。不管什么时候，你俩要老跟着我可别掉了队。”李允贤也跟张德立说：“副班长请放心吧，你走那里我跟那里。”话刚落地，李允贤听见四连阵地嚷成一片，乱喊杀声，机枪炸弹响成一片，“副班长你听那里喊……”我马上很灵活的解释：“喊你怕啥，说不定是咱四连向敌人反冲锋哩。沉着气，天快黑了，黑了敌人更没办法。”话还没说完，我眼角里瞟着村子的东北，由分队部驻地开来了队伍，更加高兴，马上转了话头接着说：“张德立，李允贤，你们看那不是咱们的队伍，增援来了，这还怕啥，晚上一定消灭这些家伙。”我用手指画着高兴得很，李允贤的脸，也开始露出笑容了。
    　　　　二、出击得胜
    敌人把四连的阵地突破，占领了山，进了村，天已黄昏，韩教导员率领着我连绕着山角由敌人的侧后向山上的敌人出击。简单动员后，部队就开始运动。我接受了任务，一面走一面小声的给张德立，李允贤动员：“咱们这次看谁立上功，谁能当上英雄，白天敌人打咱，夜间咱要打他，你俩夜间可别掉了队，只要跟着我就没危险。”
    运动时，忽然打来一发炮弹，李允贤猛然跑了几步，吓的躺下了。我说：“我不是给你说过吗？咱三个同生死共患难，只要靠边走就没事。”一会看到五班一个伤员他又吓的躺下不敢走了。我说：“我还在你前面，打是先打我，你怕啥，只要姿势低就行。”接近到山角，被敌人哨兵发觉打响了，部队跟踪猛扑上去，半山腰捉到一个俘虏，敌人被我们以飞快的动作冲散了，又吹哨子又喊叫，有的还误会给我们来取联络。“李允贤，张德立听听敌人全跑散了，还被咱们指导员捉到一个俘虏哩，你听枪打的多高。”本来李允贤不知道打来的子弹怎样是高，怎样是低，可是一冲上来没有看到咱连里谁负伤，而看到了捉的俘虏，看到了我打机枪露出半个身子，看到大家满有劲，又听我一面走一面讲“若不快就立不上功了，你可别掉队，只要供上我使油就完成了你的任务。”这时他的情绪也高了起来：“副班长请放心吧，保管掉不了队。”
    冲上山头下坡处，一个大土坑里敌人在集合，我举手就是一梭子，一面喊：“李允贤快打！”人窝里轰的一声，敌人逃散了，我们猛冲下去捉住了几个俘虏，缴获两门炮（一门是八二迫击炮）和三千多发子弹。一直追了二里多路，以上缴获李允贤那个炸弹起了很大作用。回来时，有的带俘虏，有的抬着炮，李允贤挑着子弹，一路走一路讲：“班长那个炸弹是我打的！”（附图片）
    枪炮声响成一片，李允贤吓的吓的哆嗦起来，我给他个手榴弹壮胆。
    他看到我打机枪露出半个身子，大家满有劲，情绪也高了。
    我举手就是一梭子，人窝里的轰的一声，敌人逃散了。
