　　American Soldiers in Tianjin Murder Our Compatriots Again
    【Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 29th】 On July 5th, a tragic incident occurred in Tianjin where American soldiers attempted to steal warehouse materials, and an innocent rickshaw puller compatriot was killed by the American soldiers. According to Tianjin's Yishibao, around 10 PM on the 5th, two American soldiers arrived at the border of the former British and French concessions by the river, attempting to steal materials from an American military warehouse. Rickshaw puller Shen Liyong and another rickshaw puller surnamed Wang happened to be passing by. The two American soldiers falsely claimed they needed their rickshaws to transport goods, and the two rickshaw pullers, unaware of the situation, agreed. Upon arriving at the Fourth Road Bureau warehouse, an American military sentry opened fire and killed Shen Liyong, while the two American soldiers attempting to steal escaped under the cover of the chaos. After the tragedy occurred, the traitorous and pro-foreign Chiang Kai-shek government not only failed to investigate the American soldiers' crime of killing an innocent person but also detained the witness, the rickshaw puller surnamed Wang, attempting to cover up this atrocity committed by the American soldiers.

　　天津市美军又杀我同胞
    【新华社陕北二十九日电】上月五日天津发生美军企图盗窃仓库物资，我三轮车夫同胞无辜被美军杀死惨案。据天津益世报讯：五号晚十时许，两美军行抵旧英法租界交界河畔，企图盗窃美军仓库物资，适三轮车夫沈立永及另一姓王车夫驾车经过，两美军诡称用其两车运货，两车夫不悉内情，即应邀前往。行至四路局仓库时，美军岗哨即开枪将沈立永击毙，企图盗窃之两美军反乘机逃脱。惨案发生后，卖国媚外的蒋记市政府，非但不追究美军惨杀无辜罪行，反而将证人王姓车夫扣押，企图为美军此一暴行灭迹。
