　　The Offensive of Farmers in Wuchang
　　Mu Qing
　　Wuchang County, known as the granary of Northern Manchuria, was in the midst of tense summer hoeing, yet the poor farmers were tilling the land on empty stomachs. In Taiping Village, twenty-five out of thirty-six households suffered from edema from eating wild herbs, while countless grains rotted in the cellars of the landlords. Although land reform had been carried out here for a year, the local despots and landlords paid no attention, saying, "This is like a child breaking a bowl, a dog snatching a bun." Some even shook their heads when they saw poor people eating wild herbs, saying, "How can that be eaten! We use it to feed pigs." The farmers could no longer bear it and were unwilling to continue "ce leng" (i.e., sleeping on their side, describing turning halfway over). At the county-wide labor model representative meeting, all the representatives enthusiastically put forward the slogan "Leave the house with nothing, demarcate the land as a prison," demanding the thorough distribution of the landlords' surplus property and to be driven out of their large courtyards. The county's leading organs accepted this demand and immediately launched an unprecedentedly fierce general offensive against the feudal forces. Within ten days, throughout the county, spanning over a hundred li, teams of farmers numbering in the thousands were digging for treasures every day. Four administrative villages in the Seventh District jointly struggled against several landlords in Changbao Street. The villages organized thousands of people, carrying seals, ropes, spears, wooden sticks, and vehicles for moving things, and marched to Changbao in a mighty force. The next day at dawn, more than a thousand people poured in simultaneously from all four gates. The treacherous and tyrannical landlords, in panic, had no time to disperse and hide, and a large number of stolen goods were unearthed, piling up like mountains in less than a morning. When the masses in Zhoujiagang struggled against the traitor landlord Wang Batou, the entire village, men, women, and children, organized a "grand hall" for the masses, set up the "dragon desk" for the people, and under the unanimous interrogation of hundreds of people, conducted the struggle for eight consecutive days. This forced the landlord, who had not been overthrown in six previous attempts over the past year, to recognize the power of the masses and kowtow on the ground for mercy. Finally, he was put on a cart by the masses and escorted to an isolated grave in the wilderness, where all the weapons, silver ingots, and a gold medal awarded for loyalty to the Japanese invaders, which he had buried separately in the past, were unearthed. Because the masses were universally mobilized, the movement progressed rapidly. Within a month, the masses in the entire county basically solved the difficulties of food and livestock in production, and completed the plowing of all the land. Wang Guangtun, a poor peasant in the Eighth District who had not worn a pair of pants of his own for forty years, also put on new clothes and strode proudly among the crowd. Now, in all villages and hamlets throughout the county, women and children are standing guard and patrolling. Large numbers of liberated farmers are enlisting in the army and going to the front lines. In Zhoujiagang, Seventh District alone, more than seventy young people joined the army.

　　五常农民的攻势
    穆青
    向称北满粮仓的五常县，正当夏锄紧张时，穷苦农民们却饿着肚子在铲地。太平庄三十六户人家，就有二十五户吃茴茴菜而浮肿了脖子，但在地主的地窖里，却有无数的粮食在发霉。一年来这里虽也进行了土地改革，但恶霸地主毫不在乎，反说：“这像小孩打个碗，狗衔个饽饽一样。”有的看见穷人吃茴茴菜时，还故意摇摇头说：“那啦能吃呢！俺们都拿它喂猪的。”农民们忍不住了，再也不愿意这样“侧棱”（即侧睡，形容翻了半个身）着了，在全县劳动模范代表大会上，全体代表激昂的提出：“净身出户，划地为牢”的口号，要求彻底分配地主的产浮财，赶出大院。县的领导机关接受了这一要求，立即对封建势力发动了空前猛烈的总攻势，十天之内，在纵横百余里的全县范围内，成千成万挖财宝的农民队伍，每天络绎不绝。七区四个行政村联合斗争常堡街几家地主，各屯上千群众带着封条、绳子、扎枪、木棒、搬运东西的车马，乘晚浩浩荡荡奔袭常堡，次日黎明，千余群众同时从四门涌入，奸霸地主在惊慌失措中来不及分散和隐藏，大批赃物挖掘出来，不到一个上午，即堆积如山。周家岗群众在斗争汉奸地主王把头时，全村男女老幼组织了群众的“大堂”，摆上了老百姓的“龙书案”，在几百个群众同声审问下，一连进行了八天，迫使一年来六次均未斗倒的地主，认识了群众的力量，在地叩头求饶。最后被群众架上车子簇拥至旷野孤坟，把他过去分散埋藏的武器、元宝和一个由于效忠于日寇而赏给的金质奖牌，扫数挖掘出来。由于群众普遍发动了起来，运动进展很快，一个月内，全县群众基本上解决了生产中的吃粮、牲畜等困难，并铲完了所有的土地，使四十年来没有独穿过一条裤子的八区贫农王光臀，也穿上了新衣，昂首阔步地在人群里走来走去。现在全县所有村屯，都由妇女儿童站岗放哨，大批翻身农民纷纷参军参战涌上前线，仅七区周家岗一个屯参军青年即达七十余名。（新华社东北电）
