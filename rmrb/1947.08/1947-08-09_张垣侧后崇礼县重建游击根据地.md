    Xinhua News Agency, Hebei-Rehe-Liaoning, 7th. After months of arduous struggle, Chongli County, northeast of Zhangjiakou (张北), has now established a consolidated guerrilla base area with five administrative districts and 104 villages. Since April of this year, the military and civilians in the area have successively destroyed five important strongholds, including Shanzuizi. The democratic government and the armed work teams have been helping farmers everywhere to carry out the anti-settlement movement, executing more than ten traitorous bullies and special agents. The peasants have finally been able to hold their heads high, and have held their second turn-over meetings. Each village has established a land-protection team. More than 180 peasants who have turned over have poured into the local cavalry regiment, actively attacking the puppet troops of Fu Zuoyi to protect the fruits of their liberation.

    Our newspaper, Taiyue, 7th. Over 1,400 Yan Xishan’s soldiers, captured by a certain brigade of the People's Liberation Army in Southern Shanxi during the Xiangning battle, have undergone speaking bitterness sessions, came to realize that the bandit Chiang Kai-shek is their enemy. They have requested to join the People's Liberation Army to kill the enemy and avenge themselves, and to perform meritorious service to atone for their crimes. They have submitted blood oaths and plans for revenge and meritorious service. The first batch of 600 men set off a few days ago, and the local masses held a rally to send them off. Yan Deyuan said excitedly: "We are determined to serve the people to the end, resolutely under the leadership of the Communist Party, work hard to kill the enemy, and vow to destroy the two bandits, Chiang and Yan, to liberate more areas and more oppressed people!"
