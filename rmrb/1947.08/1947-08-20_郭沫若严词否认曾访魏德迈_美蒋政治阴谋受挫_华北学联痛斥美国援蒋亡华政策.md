Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 18th. Shanghai dispatch: Prominent cultural leader Mr. Guo Moruo issued a statement on the 17th, refuting the rumors spread by the United States Information Service and the Central News Agency that he had met with Wedemeyer. Mr. Guo stated: "I don't think there is any point in visiting Wedemeyer, nor is there any need; moreover, I advise my friends who want to visit Wedemeyer not to see him." Mr. Guo sarcastically said, "We don't need to take up the time of this busy man Wedemeyer; today he goes to Manchuria, tomorrow he flies to Taiwan, and the day after tomorrow he goes to Guangzhou. He runs around in China, and his noble ears are already filled with all kinds of reports." Mr. Guo said: "I am a Chinese, and I fully agree that we must achieve China's democratic revival through our own efforts." It is reported that after Wedemeyer came to China, in addition to preparing to exchange increased aid for Chiang Kai-shek's larger-scale betrayal of the country in the civil war, he also intended to "expand" Chiang Kai-shek's government once again as a cover for American aggression and destruction of China. The so-called "organizing a coalition government excluding the Communist Party" is what this means. However, the implementation of this plan has been rejected by all righteous people in China. An Associated Press dispatch from Nanjing on the 15th also admitted that attempts to organize an anti-communist "coalition government" in China are very difficult. However, both Chiang and the United States are still vigorously publicizing Wedemeyer's contact with some so-called "middle figures," and even slandering some famous figures, which shows that this political conspiracy is still being intensified.

Xinhua News Agency, Jin-Cha-Ji, 18th. According to a delayed dispatch from Beiping: When Wedemeyer arrived in Beiping, the North China Student Federation and more than a hundred famous professors from Peking University and Tsinghua University sent letters to Wedemeyer, denouncing the US imperialist policy of aiding Chiang and destroying China. The original internal letter from the North China Student Federation was over 1,500 characters long, and after pointing out the errors of the US policy towards China, it strongly stated: We must emphasize that China should be resolved by the Chinese people themselves, and we oppose any country interfering in China's internal affairs.

　　郭沫若严词否认曾访魏德迈
  　美蒋政治阴谋受挫
    华北学联痛斥美国援蒋亡华政策
    【新华社陕北十八日电】上海消息：文化界著名领袖郭沫若氏于十七日发表声明，驳斥美国新闻处及中央社会传播的郭氏曾去见魏德迈的谣言。郭氏说：“我认为去访问魏德迈没有什么意思，而且也没有什么必要；此外，我以劝告我的要访问魏德迈的朋友不要去见他。”郭氏讽刺地说：“我们用不到去分占魏德迈这个忙人的时间，他今天赴满洲，明天飞台湾，后天又去广州，他在中国跑来跑去，他那高贵的耳朵已经塞满各种各样的报告了。”郭氏说：“我是一个中国人，而且我完全同意我们必须经过我们自己的努力来达到中国的民主复兴。”按魏德迈来华后，除准备以加强援蒋内战换得蒋介石更大规模的卖国外，并曾打算以再一次“扩大”蒋介石政府，作为美国侵略和灭亡中国的掩护色。所谓“组织不包括共产党在内的联合政府”，即是这个意思。但此一计划的进行遭到一切中国正义人士的拒绝，合众社南京十五日电亦承认企图在中国组织反共的“联合政府”一事甚为困难。但蒋美双方对魏德迈与若干所谓“中间人士”的接触仍然大肆渲染，甚至对若干著名人物横加侮蔑，足见此一政治阴谋目下仍在加紧进行中。
    【新华社晋察冀十八日电】据迟到的北平消息：魏德迈抵平时，华北学联及北大清华等百余著名教授，均曾致函魏氏，痛斥美帝国主义援蒋亡华政策。华北学联原内函达千五百余字，在指出美对华政策错误之后，力称：我们必须强调中国是应由中国人民自己解决，反对任何国家干涉中国内政。
