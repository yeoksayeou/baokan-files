Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 29th -- Comprehensive report: The Indonesian people's heroic self-defense war against Dutch aggression has won widespread sympathy from democratic and peace-loving people around the world, and the call to support Indonesia has spread globally like a raging tide. The sympathy strikes of the Dutch and Australian working classes in support of Indonesia are in full swing. In the Netherlands, mass rallies continue to be held in various cities under the leadership of trade unions and the "Dutch-Indonesian League," strongly protesting the Netherlands' unjust war. Even women's organizations have joined this movement. Dutch workers are brewing new strikes. Progressive public opinion in the Netherlands continues to criticize the Dutch government's reactionary policies. The Parool sharply pointed out: "The Dutch government's actions are no different from the former Hitler's plans. The government claims to continue to abide by the Linggadjati Agreement, but now everyone realizes that the military action against the Republic of Indonesia has finally destroyed this agreement." It further stated: "The Netherlands is fully prepared to invade the Indonesian capital, Yogyakarta, with American and British weapons, including American heavy anti-aircraft guns, British light tanks and artillery." When the Waarheid reported the UK's support for the Dutch military adventure, it stated: "The Dutch government's policy is ultimately heading towards war. Undoubtedly, the responsibility falls primarily on the Labour cabinet, which formally acts according to socialist principles but actually approves this war policy." In Australia, the National Waterside Workers' Federation's declaration on the 22nd calling for an end to Dutch atrocities has been warmly responded to by the entire Australian working class. Australia's five major trade unions have held meetings one after another, vowing to back Indonesia with practical actions. The Melbourne District Committee of the Amalgamated Engineering Union stated in a resolution: "If Dutch ships are still allowed to use Melbourne port facilities, this union will refuse to repair the ships starting from August 1st." Other unions, such as the Queensland Trades and Labor Council and the New South Wales Trades and Labor Council, have called for a boycott of Dutch ships. Australian students sympathetic to the Indonesian people's resistance war held a grand demonstration parade on the 25th, holding high the banner of "Oppose Dutch Aggression." When the procession reached the Dutch consulate, the demonstrating students shouted slogans protesting the Dutch reactionary policies. Personnel from the Dutch consulate poured water from the sixth floor to assist the police in beating the demonstrating masses. According to a subsequent investigation, several female students were scalded, and thirteen students were arrested. In India, S.A. Dange, President of the All India Trade Union Congress, recently stated that he was extremely indignant about "the Netherlands' attack on the Republic of Indonesia with weapons supplied by imperialism." He demanded: "Members of all Indian trade unions should quickly organize a movement to boycott Dutch ships, not to provide any assistance to the Dutch army in India, refuse to load munitions on ships, and prevent Dutch ships transporting troops to fight in Indonesia from leaving Indian ports." Pakistan's Governor-General Jinnah issued a statement on the 25th, opposing the Dutch government's launching of war against Indonesia regardless of mediation, expressing "deep sympathy for the Indonesian people and will help Indonesia in its war of resistance in every possible way." In the UK, two Labour MPs are scheduled to submit a proposal to Bevin in Parliament on the 30th, suggesting a change in the UK's aid policy to the Netherlands. The proposal will include: (1) stopping the supply of weapons and equipment to the Netherlands; (2) withdrawing all facilities within the UK used to train the Dutch army; (3) prohibiting the Dutch army from using Singapore as a transshipment station for munitions. In the United States, the Committee for Indonesian Independence, in its telegram to Marshall, condemned the United States for supplying the Netherlands with weapons loans and protested against the Netherlands "using troops trained in the United States to deliberately destroy the lives, property, and hard-won freedom of the Indonesian people." The committee also telegraphed the UN Security Council, requesting that it take necessary measures regarding the Indonesian situation, which "seriously threatens" security and the right to self-determination. The entire Czech Republic is seething with anger at the bloody crimes caused by Dutch imperialism. Most newspapers in Prague take the same view, believing that "the Dutch piratical and barbaric colonial policy should be sanctioned."

    支援印尼
    呼声传遍全球
    【新华社陕北廿九日电】综合报导：印尼人民反抗荷兰侵略的英勇自卫战博得了世界爱好民主和平人士的广泛同情，支援印尼的呼声，已怒涛般的波及全球。荷、澳工人阶级支援印尼的同情罢工方兴未艾。在荷兰，各城市职工会及“荷、印联盟”领导下各团体，目前继续举行群众大会，强烈抗议荷兰非正义战争，甚至妇女界组织也卷入了这一运动。荷兰工人又在酝酿着新的罢工。荷兰国内的进步舆论，继续抨击荷政府的反动政策。巴维尔报尖锐地指出：“荷政府的行动与前希特勒的计划没有任何区别。政府宣称继续遵守林牙加蒂协定，现在谁都认识到反印尼共和国的军事行动，最后地摧毁了这个协定。”继称：“荷兰完全准备以美、英武器，包括美国重高射炮、英国轻坦克与大炮，向印尼首都日惹进犯。”瓦尔海德报播发英国支持荷兰的军事冒险时称：“荷政府的政策最后走向战争。无疑的，责任首先要落到工党内阁身上，他们形式上按社会主义原则做事，实际上却通过了这个战争政策。”在澳洲，全国码头工会联合会于二十二日呼吁制止荷兰暴行的宣言，已得到全澳工人阶级热烈的响应，澳洲五大著名工会相继集会，誓以实际行动为印尼后盾。机械工人联盟墨尔本区委会在决议中称：“假若荷兰船只仍被允要利用墨尔本港口设备，本联盟将于八月一日开始拒绝修理船只。”其他如昆土兰职工联合会，新南威尔士职工联合会等工会，都号召抵制荷兰船只。同情印尼人民抗战的澳洲学生，于二十五日高举“反对荷兰侵略”的旗帜，举行盛大示威游行。行列抵荷领事馆时，示威学生高呼抗议荷兰反动政策的口号。荷领事馆人员竟从六层楼上倒水，以协助殴打示威群众的警察。据事后调查，有若干女生被烫伤，被捕学生十三名。在印度，全印职工会联合会主席丹吉，顷发表谈话，对“荷兰用帝国主义供给的武器攻击印尼共和国”一事，感到异常愤懑。他要求：“印度各工会会员迅速组织抵制荷轮运动，不给在印度境内的荷军以任何援助，拒绝载运军火上船，并且阻止输送军队赴印尼作战的荷兰船只离开印度港。”巴基斯坦总督金纳于二十五日发表谈话，反对荷兰政府不顾调停而向印尼开战，表示“深深的同情印尼人民，并将以一切可能帮助印尼抗战。”在英国英工党议员二名，定于卅日在议会向贝文提出改变英国援荷政策的建议。该建议将包括：（一）停止接济荷兰以武器和装备；（二）撤消英国境内用以训练荷军之各项设备；（三）禁止荷军利用新加坡为军火转运站。在美国，援印独立委员会在其致马歇尔电文中，斥责美国以武器贷款供应荷尔，并抗议荷兰“利用在美国训练的军队，蓄谋摧毁印尼人民的生命、财产与艰苦得来的自由。”该会并致电联合国安理会，要求对“严重胁威”安全与自治权利的印尼局势采去必要措施。捷克全国沸腾对着荷帝国主义所造成的流血罪行的愤怒，布拉格大部分报纸取同一观点，认为“荷兰这种海盗式的与野蛮的殖民地政策，应当受到制裁”。
