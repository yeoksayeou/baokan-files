Taiyue, August 9th (reported by this newspaper) In Nanzhong and other five villages in the newly recovered Jiyuan District, a movement of "settling old and new scores together" has been launched. After the Chiang Kai-shek troops reoccupied Longtai last year, the landlords who had previously lowered their heads immediately bared their fangs and claws to "reverse the settlement" against the peasants. The local tyrant Yan Yingui of Nanzhong village detained the emancipated peasants Jin Hairui and Wang Tibin, forced them to wear cangues weighing on eight men, fined them 200,000 yuan, and pointed to Hairui's and Tibao's heads, saying, "You have fallen into my hands!" The landlord Jia Hengxiu of Dongtian Village scolded his emancipated uncle, Jia Yourun, saying, "Do you want your head to be up or down?" The landlord Shang Dongtang of Zhangjin Village slapped his emancipated uncle in the face and said, "Why didn't you follow your Eighth Route Daddy?" Under these circumstances, the peasants' will to struggle was not diminished. The peasant Zhang Qingfu of Nanzhong Village said, "As long as the Eighth Route Army comes, I will fight these reactionaries alone!" Another peasant said, "Chiang's troops are oppressing me so much that I just want to die; but I am an emancipated peasant under the leadership of Chairman Mao, and I must see my loved ones even if I die." Tifu's son, who was only ten years old, saw the tragic state of his father being "reversed settlement," and encouraged his father, saying, "Dad, don't be angry. As long as our Eighth Route Army comes, as long as I grow up, I will definitely avenge this!" When Longtai was recovered, the masses in Xiguolu immediately detained the two "reverse settlement" ringleaders in the village and began to settle accounts. The masses in Suncun Village cheered excitedly when they heard that the "reverse settlement" ringleaders had been captured. When the landlord of Xing× Village carried out "reverse settlement," he was so vicious that he forced the peasants to carry things to his home. This time, the peasants retaliated in kind, demanding that the landlord return all the things that had been reversed settlement, and sarcastically said, "Why don't you use them anymore?" This time, the peasants' struggle with the landlords was particularly firm. After the masses in Zhangjin Village struggled against the "reverse settlement" landlord Shang Dongxi, a cadre suggested leaving him a few acres of good land. The masses in the whole village opposed, saying, "You are still planning for the landlord. Have you seen the suffering we have suffered from the landlord?" At present, the movement is spreading from five administrative villages to all directions.

　　新旧仇一齐报
  　济源新区农民痛斗倒算地主
    【本报太岳九日电】济源新恢复区南冢等五村，展开“新旧仇一齐报”运动。去年蒋军重陷龙台后，曾表示低头的地主，立刻张牙舞爪的向农民“倒算”。南冢奸霸阎引贵，将翻身农民靳海瑞、王体宾扣押起来，压了八个人的杠子，罚了廿万元，并指着海瑞、体宝的脑袋说：“你们可犯到我的手里了。”东添村地主贾恒秀骂其翻身的叔父贾有润说：“你想头朝上还是朝下呢？”张金村地主尚东堂打了他的翻身舅父一个耳光说：“你怎不跟上你的八路爹爹去呢？”农民在此种情况下，斗争意志并未被消磨。南冢农民张清福说：“只要八路军来，我一个人也要和这些反动派干！”又有一个农民说：“蒋军这样欺压我，我简直想死；但我是毛主席领导下的翻身农民，死也得见见亲人。”体福的儿子才十岁，看见其父被“倒算”的惨状，便鼓励父亲说：“爹，你不要气，只要咱们八路军来，只要我能长大，定要报了这个仇！”当收复龙台后，西郭路群众马上将村内两个“倒算”头子扣起来，进行清算。孙村群众听说抓住了“倒算”头子，便兴奋的欢呼起来。形×村地主“倒算”时，凶恶得让农民扛上东西往他家里送，此次农民也以眼还眼，要地主将所有倒算的东西如数送上门来，并讽刺的说：“你怎么不用啦？”此次农民与地主斗争特别坚决，张金村群众斗争了“倒算”地主尚东锡后，一个干部提出为其留几亩好地，全村群众皆反对的说：“你还替地主打算，我们受地主的罪你看见了没有？”目前运动正由五个行政村向四面普及中。
