Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 6th. Moscow Dispatch: Prominent Soviet economist Lev Mendelson recently wrote an article in "World Economics and Politics" discussing Britain's economic difficulties, stating: The changes in Britain's position in the world economy and the intensification of economic contradictions between the United States and Britain necessitate that the British bourgeoisie rebuild certain of its heavy industries. Britain has always exported large quantities of coal, but the coal shortage that began in Britain in 1946 has greatly restricted the production increase plans of various industries and has seriously affected foreign policy. The American business journal "Business Week" ridiculed this, saying: "When the Labor government sees that it is unable to bear the cost of its long imperial lines of communication, it may want to hand over the responsibility for certain important strategic strongholds to the United States." The coal shortage has also further worsened the decline in British exports and the trade deficit. Although Britain's steel production is about 13 million tons per year, it is still insufficient to meet its needs. Although electricity generation in 1946 also exceeded the pre-war level by 56 percent, it was still greatly inadequate. Prominent British economist Piers predicts that Britain's economic recovery will take more than ten years and require 11 billion to 14 billion pounds, and that until 1955, Britain will still need 2 billion to 7 billion pounds of investment. Due to these many difficulties, the British bourgeoisie is desperately strengthening its exploitation of the British working class in an attempt to gain its position in the world economy. But facts will prove that this wish will be a fantasy.

Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 6th. Agence France-Presse, Washington: British and French figures are currently accelerating research into a method to utilize their respective countries' dollar assets in the United States to the greatest extent possible, in order to cope with the equally severe economic situations in both countries. According to reliable sources, French dollar assets total between 450 million and 750 million dollars. Similar news comes from Britain. British and French parties are maintaining a cautious attitude regarding the extent to which the United States will cooperate in investigating these hidden dollars.

Also, in order to cope with the current domestic economic crisis, in addition to continuing to draw on US loans, a certain authoritative figure in the British government stated on July 27th that the British government may also draw on its 640 million pounds (approximately 2.56 billion US dollars) of gold reserves to make up for the gap after the US loans may be used up at the end of this year and before any US "Marshall Plan" is implemented.

### 实行反动内政外交政策结果　英法经济困难更严重

　　实行反动内政外交政策结果
  　英法经济困难更严重
    【新华社陕北六日电】莫斯科讯：著名苏联经济学家莱夫·孟德逊顷于“世界经济与政治”杂志上撰文论英国经济之困难称：英国在世界经济中地位的改变及美英经济矛盾的加剧，使英国资产阶级非重建其某些重工业不可。英国一向输出大量之煤炭，但在一九四六年英国开始发生的煤荒，使各种工业的增产计划受到极大限制，而且严重影响了外交政策。美国的商界机关刊物“商业周刊”曾对此讥诮说：“工党政府看到它自己无力担负其漫长的帝国交通线的费用时，可能想将某些重要战略据点的责任交给美国。”煤荒并使英国出口减少和收支不敷的情况更加恶化。英国的钢产量，虽然每年有一千三百万吨左右，可是还不足以供应其需要。发电量在一九四六年虽也超过了战前水平百分之五十六，但仍大感不足。著名英国经济学家派尔斯预料英国经济的复兴须时十年以上，需款一百一十亿至一百四十亿英镑，直到一九五五年，英国仍将需要二十亿至七十亿英镑的投资。由于这许多困难，英国资产阶级便拚命加强对英国工人阶级之剥削，以图争取其在世界经济中之地位。但事实会证实此种愿望将是空想。
    【新华社陕北六日电】法新闻社华府讯：英法人士最近正加速研究一种方法，俾能动用各该国国民在美之美元资产至最高限度，以应付两国同样严重的经济局势。据可靠人士估计，法国美元资产共有四亿五千万到七亿五千万元之间。来自英国的消息亦与此类似。英法双方人士对于在侦查这些隐藏的美元中，美国会合作到什么程度，尚持慎重态度。
    【又讯】英国为应付目前国内的经济危机，除继续提用美国贷款外，英国政府中某权威人士七月二十七日更称：英政府并可能提用其六亿四千万镑（约合二十五亿六千万美元）的黄金储蓄，以弥补今年年底美国贷款可能用完之后，及任何美国“马歇尔计划”实行之前的空缺。
