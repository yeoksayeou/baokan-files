    Liushengou Coal Mine
    August 1st Commendation and Model Selection
    Summary of Production and Savings
    [Our Newspaper's News] The Liushengou Coal Mine, in commemoration of the "August 1st" anniversary of the founding of the Red Army, summarized that the production and savings labor emulation campaign from March to June had yielded great results. The mechanical and electrical section, using the method of large-scale mutual assistance, reduced personnel and completed repair and manufacturing work. Taking Liuhegou as the standard, efficiency increased by 30%. After the tunneling project campaign, efficiency increased by more than 18%. The sand removal efficiency of Shaft No. 1 doubled. The sand removal efficiency of Shaft No. 2 more than doubled.
    In terms of family members' production, all nineteen family members, except for individual special circumstances, participated in production. In addition to doing housework and odd jobs, they also spun and sewed. Li Zhongliang's mother alone spun more than twenty catties of yarn, earning 150 catties of millet.
    In terms of savings: office supplies, such as pen nibs and ink, saved more than 20,000 yuan in foreign currency in four months. Equipment and raw materials saved more than 200,000 yuan in foreign currency. In addition, almost all employees in the entire mine performed voluntary labor.
    The summary was based on the following criteria for meritorious service: (1) good production efficiency; (2) good creation and invention; (3) good unity and mutual assistance; (4) good learning spirit; (5) good labor attitude; (6) good household management; (7) good self-discipline and public service; (8) good worker-peasant relations; (9) good production and savings; (10) good care of the factory. After evaluation in large and small meetings, everyone received meritorious service awards (the scope of meritorious service awards was relatively broad to encourage the workers' initiative). Among them, those who made special meritorious service included: Yang Xinshan, who used a pipe connected to the chimney to create ventilation for the underground mine that was about to stop working; Li Zhongliang, who was responsible for underground supervision. When another supervisor was ill, he took on the task and worked day and night for more than a month without fatigue. He was also a member of the trade union and did not relax his education on the unity of workers. These were all rewarded and commended. (Han Guojun)

    六盛沟煤矿
    八一评功表模
    总结生产节约
    【本报讯】六盛沟煤矿于纪念“八一”红军诞生日，总结三至六月份生产节约立功运动收获很大。机务股用大互助的方法，减少人员完成了修制工作，以六河沟为准，效率提高了百分之三十，凿井工程运动后效率提高了百分之十八强。一号井出沙效率提高了一倍。二号井则提高了一倍强。
    在家属生产上，十九个家属除个别特殊情况外，全部参加生产，在做家务一切杂事及缝连以外纺织缝衣，仅李忠良母亲一人，即纺线二十来斤，收入小米一百五十斤。
    节约方面：办公用具，如钢笔尖墨水等，四个月共节省洋二万余元。器材原料共节洋二十万余元。此外全矿里职工员几乎全部尽了义务工。
    总结中依照：（一）生产效率好。（二）创造发明好。（三）团结互助好。（四）学习精神好。（五）劳动态度好。（六）建立家务好。（七）克己奉公好。（八）工农关系好，（九）生产节约好。（十）爱护工厂好的立功条件，经大会小会评议，人人都立了功，（立功面较宽以鼓职工的前进心。）其中立特功者有：杨信山利用烟筒接上管子创造了将要停工的井下风通出，李忠良负井下监工之责，另一个监工病的时候他便把这个工作任务担负起来，日以继夜的干了一个多月，不知疲倦，他还担任工会委员对职工的团结教育也没放松，这些都受到奖励与表扬。（韩国俊）
