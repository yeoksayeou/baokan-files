August 1st Talk on Northeast

Chiang's Troops Have Been Compressed into a Corner

[Xinhua News Agency, Northeast, 1st dispatch] Our agency's special correspondent on the Northeast front reports on August 1st that Chiang's bandit troops have now been compressed into a narrow corridor along the Changchun Railway and the Beining Railway. With the exception of a few cities, the Democratic Allied Forces have completely recovered the liberated areas that existed before May of last year. During the summer offensive, the Democratic Allied Forces recovered as many as 29 cities in May alone, far exceeding the highest record of 20 cities occupied by Chiang's troops in the Northeast during the same period (May) last year. In the Fourth Defense of Linjiang campaign this spring, the Democratic Allied Forces annihilated or routed the enemy with the same number of troops as Chiang's army, with enemy-to-friendly casualties at a ratio of 80 to 1. In the first 20 days of the summer offensive, six divisions of regular troops were annihilated in whole batches, and 31 senior Chiang army officers, including division commanders, were killed, wounded, or captured. On the 20th anniversary of the birth of the Chinese Workers' and Peasants' Red Army—the predecessor of the Chinese People's Liberation Army—the armed forces of the Northeast people alone have greatly exceeded the total of the Chinese Red Army before the War of Resistance Against Japan, and their combat effectiveness and equipment are even more incomparable to that time. And Du Yuming, who was once "dominant" and arrogant, clamoring to "recover the Northeast" from the hands of the Northeast people, how long ago did he end up being demoted to the sea due to military defeat and the loss of his generals? On this "August 1st" festival of the birth of the People's Liberation Army, the Democratic Allied Forces, armed with American weapons and dominating the white mountains and black waters, under the leadership of General Lin Biao, are making every effort to improve their combat power to prepare for a deeper blow to Chiang's bandits.

    八一话东北
    蒋军已被压缩于一隅
    【新华社东北一日电】本社东北前线特派记者八一话东北，蒋贼匪军现已被压缩于中长及北宁路狭长走廊地带中，除几座城市外，民主联军全部恢复去年五月前之解放区领域。在夏季攻势中，五月一个月内民主联军收复城市即达二十九座，远超过去年同期（五月）蒋军在东北占我廿座城市之最高记录。今春第四次临江战役中，民主联军以与蒋军同样兵力歼灭或击溃敌人，敌我伤亡为八十比一。至夏季攻势则在头二十天内，即整批歼灭正规军六个师之众，毙伤俘蒋军师长等高级军官达三十一名，在中国人民解放军的前身——中国工农红军诞生的二十周年，仅东北人民的武装即已大大超过了抗日战争前中国红军的总和，其战斗力及装备，更与当时不可比拟。而所谓“叱咤风云”，趾高气扬，扬言向东北人民手中“收复东北”的杜聿明，曾几何时，终以兵败将折黜居海上。隙此“八一”人民解放军诞生节日，手执美国武器雄踞白山黑水间的民主联军在林彪将军率领下，正全力进行提高战斗力量准备予蒋贼以更深重之打击。
