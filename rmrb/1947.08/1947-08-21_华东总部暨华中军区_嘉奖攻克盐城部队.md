Xinhua News Agency, East China, 19th. The East China People's Liberation Army Headquarters and the Central China Military Region issued an order to commend the troops that captured Yancheng. The original telegram stated: "You captured Yancheng, annihilated the remnants of the traitor Hao's First Division, opened up a new situation behind enemy lines in Central China, and supported and cooperated with the Liu-Deng Corps' flanking attack, as well as the annihilation of the enemy in the inner lines of the Shandong battlefield. We hope you will continue your efforts and strive for even greater victories. We hereby congratulate you and issue an order to commend the meritorious soldiers."

Xinhua News Agency, Central China, 19th. Four hours after Ye Ting City (Yancheng) was recovered, dozens of newly captured military trucks were already driving on the main streets of the city. The headlights illuminated the streets brightly. PLA soldiers climbed into the trucks and said proudly, "We can also ride in cars in the Jiang area now!" Trucks transported the spoils of war back and forth in teams. Militiamen pointed and counted, "These are mountain gun shells," "These are 60mm mortar shells," "These are..." and cheered excitedly, "Look, we will have even more capital for the counter-offensive in the future!" The citizens said one after another: "In 1945, when the New Fourth Army launched a major counter-offensive and annihilated Zhao Yunxiang's puppet army corps, a batch of artillery shells were transported once. This is the second time. But this time there are even more than that time."

Xinhua News Agency, Central China, 19th. In coordination with the Yancheng battle, the local armed forces and militia of Dongtai and Taipei in central Jiangsu carried out continuous large-scale sabotage on the Hai'an-Cha line and the Hai'an-Liuzhuang section of the Tongyu line. Large gaps were dug everywhere on the 200-plus-mile highway, bridges were blown up, and telephone lines were cut. The sabotage extended to just over a mile from the strongholds, and the Chiang puppets were terrified and dared not move out. More than 300 enemies in Baiju fled in panic to Dongtai City on the night of the 5th, and the enemy's transportation was completely paralyzed.

  　嘉奖攻克盐城部队
    【新华社华东十九日电】华东人民解放军总部暨华中军区顷传令嘉奖攻克盐城部队，原电略称：你们攻克盐城，歼灭郝逆残部第一师，开辟华中敌后新局面，支援和配合了刘邓兵团的侧击，及山东战场的内线歼敌，望再接再厉，争取更伟大的胜利，特此祝贺，并传令嘉奖有功将士。
    【新华社华中十九日电】叶挺城（盐城）收复后四小时，新缴获的几十辆军用卡车，已在城内大街上开动起来。车灯把街道照耀得雪亮。解放军战士们爬上车去，骄傲地说：“我们在蒋后也有汽车坐了。”卡车、成队地来回转运着战利品。民兵们指手划脚地数着：“这是山炮弹”、“这是六○炮弹”、“这是………”兴奋得欢呼起来：“看吧，将来反攻本钱更大啦！”市民们纷纷说：“民国三十四年新四军大反攻歼灭伪军赵云祥一个军时，曾成批运过一次炮弹，这回是第二次了。但这次比那次更多。”
    【新华社华中十九日电】配合盐城战役，苏中东台、台北地方武装和民兵在海（安）＠（茶）线及通榆线之海安、刘庄段进行连续大破击，二百余里公路线上到处挖开大缺口，炸毁桥梁收割电话线，破击直至离据点仅里余处，蒋伪惊恐万状不敢出动，白驹敌三百余并于五日夜狼狈逃往东台城，敌交通已完全陷于麻痹状态。
