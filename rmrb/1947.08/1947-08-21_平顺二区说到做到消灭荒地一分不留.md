　　Ping Shun Second District Delivers on its Promise to Eliminate All Wasteland

    [Report from this newspaper, Ping Shun] In order to resolutely eliminate wasteland and ensure not a single piece remained, the Second District mobilized proactive members of production from each village on August 1st to cooperate with district cadres in a widespread inspection. Within two days, all 455.5 mu of wasteland belonging to 266 households in the district were eliminated. Among them, 12 mu were planted with rhubarb, and the rest were planted with vegetables. Additionally, 35 mu were re-terraced and repaired. The following methods were adopted during the intensive elimination: (1) Ideological education was used to get through to people. Landlords and former rich peasants were reluctant to cultivate poor land. For example, the landlord Zhang Qichang said: "Cultivating it myself is not as good as working as a laborer elsewhere." Some new and old middle peasants had good land but did not cultivate poor land. After discovering this, the method of recalling how they used to survive was used to get through to the new and old middle peasants. For landlords and rich peasants, the method of mobilizing the masses to reason with the landlords was adopted. For example, Yang Jinlou said to the landlord Yang Qingchun: "Why don't you cultivate the land? In the past, we had to rent your poor land, and now we give it to you for free. Can we allow it to be barren? Do you still want to exploit the blood and sweat of the peasants?" After this, the landlord was left speechless. Through reasoning with the landlords, the peasants ideologically separated themselves from the landlords. For example, Song Jinshan said: "If we peasants don't cultivate the land now, that's landlord thinking." (2) The method of calculating the cost of wasteland was used to prove that cultivating wasteland was worthwhile. (3) Mutual aid teams cultivated collectively and distributed vegetables according to work points. Wang Tize's team planted vegetables and plowed 5.4 mu in one night. (4) Labor was exchanged for labor, and wages were paid in the autumn if exchange was not possible. For example, Li Shunda's team gave wages in the autumn for planting vegetables for other teams. For example, Longzhen Jing Rensong's team used spare time to exchange labor for planting vegetables, which solved the problem of fear of paying wages. (5) Cadres divided the work to lead the masses. (6) Comprehensive inspection and mutual inspection, and radio praise played a significant role. For example, after a comprehensive inspection in Yangwei Village,班换班 inspections were organized, and another four mu of land were found and immediately eliminated. Ma Zhixiu went to the radio broadcaster and said: "My wasteland is all planted, won't you broadcast about me?" Longzhen used thirteen locations for unified broadcasting, with one location sending the main signal and twelve locations receiving it. For example, in Shixia Village, wasteland was discovered in a mountain village during the morning inspection. At lunchtime, the masses were mobilized, and the entire mountain village was mobilized that afternoon, and the wasteland was eliminated in half a day, with inspection and mobilization done simultaneously. Dongpo farmer Zhang Jinshui said: "This time it's truly said and done." All wasteland in the district has been eliminated, and the wheat fields have been plowed once, and now they are turning to cutting artemisia and collecting fertilizer. (Shuang Hong)

    [Report from this newspaper, Zuoquan] Since the Seventh District suffered from hail and then drought, the morale of the masses in some villages was low. The leaders organized everyone to discuss. Liu Xigui of Nanye said: "In my opinion, we still have to plant. 'Keep dying, keep planting, keep planting until we can't plant anymore.'" In the entire process of eliminating wasteland and hoeing seedlings, "hoeing seedlings when it's dry, planting vegetables when it rains," "when people are busy, the weather is not, when the weather is busy, it's only for one time." If we don't take advantage of the early season to hoe and plant more, we won't be able to handle it when the weather is bad. Therefore, villages like Si Ma are planting collectively by mutual aid teams and brigades, recording labor first, and then distributing vegetables according to points in the autumn, which solves the difficulty of seedlings not being valued. In just thirteen days, the entire district eliminated a total of 1883.7 mu of wasteland. In Nangou, a small village of more than forty households, they took dry food at noon and didn't come back for four days, and the whole village collectively opened four places on the water terrace eight miles away, totaling 67 mu, exceeding the original plan of 660 mu set on July 1. In order to better evaluate merits in the autumn, the district has now convened a meeting of joint defense team leaders to organize mutual inspections between villages.

　　平顺二区说到做到消灭荒地一分不留
    【本报平顺讯】二区为了坚决消灭荒地做到一分不留，八月一日从各村调来生产中积极分子配合区干普遍检查，两天内把全区二百六十六户的四百五十五亩五分荒地全部消灭，内有十二亩地种大黄，其余都种上菜了；并重新垒峰修滩卅五亩。突击消灭中采取以下几种办法：（一）教育打通思想，地主旧富农嫌地坏不种，如地主张其昌说：我种还不如到外打忙工。新旧中农有些有好地不种坏地。发现后对新旧中农，采用回想靠什么活办法打通思想，对地主富农采用了发动群众给地主说理办法。如杨金楼给地主杨庆春说：“你为什么不种地？过去我们租你的坏地还得出租，现在我们白给你种，能叫荒了你还不种？还想剥削农民血汗吗？”经过这样，把地主说的闭口无言。从给地主说理中，农民都在思想上给地主分了家，如宋金山说：“咱农民今后不种地，就是地主思想。”（二）用渡荒算帐办法，证明种荒地合适。（三）互助组集体种，按工分菜。王提则组一夜种菜犁地五亩四分。（四）以工换工，换不了秋后给工资。如李顺达组，给别组种菜都是秋后给工资。如龙镇景仁松组，种菜短下工抽空换工，这样解决怕出工资问题。（五）干部分工领导群众。（六）全面检查互相抽查，广播表扬起了很大作用。如杨威村经过全面检查后，又组织班换班检查，全村又查出地四亩，立时消灭。马芝秀去找广播人说：我荒地种完了，就不给我广播？龙镇用十三个地点统一广播，一地发总音，十二个地方接总音。如石匣村在前晌检查出一山庄有荒地，到吃午饭时，发动群众，当天下午全山庄出动，半天都把荒地消灭光，并且做到随检查随发动。东坡农民张进水说：这次真是说到做到。全区荒地已全部消灭，麦地也普犁一遍，现正转入割蒿积肥中。（双红）
    【本报左权讯】七区自遭冰灾后，又遇天旱，有些村群众情绪低落，领导上组织大家讨论。南冶刘喜贵说：据我说来还是要种，“一直死一直种，一直种到不能种”。在整个灭荒锄苗说来，“天旱锄苗，有雨种菜”，“人忙天不忙，天忙只一场”，如果不趁早多锄多种，天一下甚也顾不过来。故驷等村，是以互助组与队集体种，先按劳力分记起来，将来秋后按分分菜，这样解决了三种三没苗等价困难。全区在短短十三天内，共计消灭荒地一八八三·七亩。只南沟一个四十多户小村，有四天内晌午拿干粮不回来，全村集体到八里外水梯上开了四处共计六十七亩，超过七一原定计划六百六十余亩。为了秋后好评功，现在区里开了联防组长会，组织村与村相互检查。
