	Pulled Up Crops, Yet Still Demanding Grain
	A True Record of the Atrocities of the Kuomintang Army on the Shandong Front. By Hu Zheng
	On the night of June 30th, the People's Liberation Army crossed the 350-li Yellow River defense line with a powerful force. The Kuomintang army, with their tails between their legs, fled from their various strongholds and cities that very night. But these beasts did not waste a single second in carrying out violent killings and oppressing the people.
	At dawn on July 1st, the People's Liberation Army arrived in Hanzhuang, just two hours after the Kuomintang army had fled. An old man named Han Qiyi stopped the vanguard at the entrance to the village, tearfully accusing them. He pointed to a barren field outside the village and told us:
	"The Kuomintang army forced us to pull up all the sorghum on my two and a half mu of land..."
	From this old man's accusation, we learned that this place, just three days before, had been a dense sorghum forest, taller than a man. Now it was a desolate wilderness as far as the eye could see. Green sorghum stalks lay scattered on the ground, and flocks of crows pecked at the half-ripe millet. The order to pull up the sorghum had been issued five days earlier. This order was very harsh. When the first order from Caozhou Prefecture reached the puppet county governments, it stated that all the sorghum within five li on both sides of the main roads and within ten li around the county towns had to be completely pulled up within three days. Failure to complete the task would be punished by military law. In fact, everyone knew that the roads in the Hebei-Shandong-Henan plains were as dense as a spider web, and the distance between roads never exceeded one li. Therefore, the orders from the puppet county governments were even more thorough, ordering the farmers in each village to pull up all the sorghum. Their reason was frank and simple: "Sorghum obstructs the view. When the Eighth Route Army comes, we can't see them. It's also inconvenient for the Kuomintang army to retreat." But the shameless beasts were not ashamed of this sinful measure. When the farmers begged to leave a little, they shouted sternly: "This is an order! Who cares if you starve to death! When the Kuomintang army came, they told you not to plant sorghum. You insisted on planting it yourselves. Who can you blame?"
	This spring, the puppet county government did issue this order. Obviously, when they first came here, they foresaw their fate. But sorghum is the main food for the people in the Hebei-Shandong-Henan plains, and sorghum stalks are the main fuel. Could the people watch the fertile land lie fallow and wait to starve to death? But this was the people's business, and had nothing to do with the "Kuomintang army." The "Kuomintang army's" task was to issue orders prohibiting the planting of grain on one hand, and to issue orders urging the payment of military grain on the other. This was truly the most tyrannical and contradictory policy in human history, rarely seen in a thousand years.
	This contradiction is even more obvious in the following facts: In Hulitou Village, Caozhou, there were 148 households with 532 people. The Kuomintang army came in September of the lunar calendar last year. In just over half a year, they collected an average of 23 jin of grain per mu, and the "Self-Defense Force" gun fees totaled 8 million yuan, averaging 60,000 yuan per household. In Wuzhuang, the average was 21 jin per mu, and the gun fee was 7,000 yuan per mu. In Gulou, Juye County, more than 20 households with 130 people paid an average of 80,000 yuan per person for grain and gun fees. In Mazhuang, Dingtao, Ma Yingzong's family alone suffered when the Kuomintang army came. They said he was in contact with the Eighth Route Army, and he sold 30 mu of land, a cow, and two shi of grain, spending 5.7 million yuan to prove his innocence. But even though he sold his property, he still had to pay donations. He still had to pay 25 jin of grain per mu, a gun fee of 1,500 yuan, as well as dyeing fees, straw sandal fees... Every month there were various expenses that had to be paid. However, the order prohibiting the planting of sorghum was also brought to each household by the same people who urged the payment of grain. And what they wanted to pull up was not limited to sorghum. Even millet, beans, sweet potatoes, and melon vines had to be pulled up. No crops should exist when they grew up; they all had to be pulled up. Their reason was: Millet also "obstructs the view" when it grows, while the crime of sweet potatoes, beans, and melon vines was that they "trip people when they run." On July 4th, in Zhangzhuang, Dehua District, Caozhou, this reporter personally saw that all the melon fields on both sides of the road had been destroyed. The melon vines and leaves were covered in yellow sand, and the injured half-ripe watermelons and cantaloupes were broken. Some were trampled to pieces. As a team of people passed by, green-headed flies rose with a buzz. This painful image would arouse anger in anyone who saw it! The land in this area is low-lying and the soil is poor, mostly sand. Other grains are not easy to grow. This year there was a drought, and the melon harvest was relatively good. There was little sorghum in this area, and the millet, sweet potatoes, and beans had not yet grown. With no crops to pull up, it was the turn of these innocent melon vines.
	When this reporter went to visit the owner of a suffering melon field, he was not at home. His name was Zhang Mingli. His whole family of six depended on a few mu of melon fields for their livelihood. He went crazy when the melons were pulled up and ran off somewhere. His neighbor told me that when the melon vines were being pulled up, Zhang Mingli and his wife kowtowed to the Kuomintang army, asking them to leave the melons so that the whole family could survive for a few more months. A "Kuomintang army" officer twisted his wife's face around to look at it and spat on her face, saying, "Looking at your face, it's disgusting!" Then he ordered all the melons to be kicked open and kicked the pregnant woman. I walked into the home of this woman who had been insulted and saw her lying on a piece of torn mat, already on the verge of death. At this time, I met another young man of nineteen named Yuan XX. He had gone to the market early the day before to sell melons and earned 4,000 yuan, but was arrested by the Kuomintang army and sent to work as a porter. The village was 25 li away from Caozhou Prefecture. They were not allowed to rest along the way, nor were they allowed to drink a mouthful of water. After they were sent there, all the melon money was taken away. In Huayuan Village, two li away from this village, a young man named Wang was sent to work as a porter. Because it was hot and the cart was too heavy to push, the "Kuomintang army" stabbed him in the thigh with a bayonet. Fresh blood flowed down his pants, but the "Kuomintang army" still forced him to push the cart for two li with a bayonet. The crimes of the beasts are endless. The order to pull up the sorghum, like a natural disaster to exterminate humanity, destroyed the countryside. As a result, the area within five or ten li around the towns in Juye, Caozhou, and Dingtao became a wilderness. The crops that were preserved within ten li were all the result of extremely difficult struggles. Zhang XX of Shawochen Village told this reporter: "The orders were being urged urgently, but everyone stubbornly refused to pull them up. Everyone knew that the Eighth Route Army was coming soon!" Under these circumstances, three orders were issued. The first order said: Leave one sorghum stalk, and you will be fined one bullet. The next day, another order: One sorghum stalk, and you will be fined one gun. The third order said that if you didn't pull it up within three days, you would be shot. The people's answer to him was loud and clear: "Shoot, then shoot! We're going to die anyway! We won't pull it up even if we die!" But on the night of the second day after the third order was issued, our artillery fire sounded, and all those who issued the orders ran away. The People's Liberation Army arrived that day.
	Before the People's Liberation Army arrived, the farmers waged a resolute struggle to protect their lives. A farmer in his forties named Feng told me that he had a brother-in-law in his sixties, with thirty-odd mu of land and a cow. As soon as the "Kuomintang army" arrived, he was arrested because his son was in the Eighth Route Army. After several months of mediation, he spent more than 5 million yuan, selling all his land and the cow. This time, when the order to pull up the grain was issued, the old man and another old man from the neighborhood led the whole village to resolutely resist the order. Under their leadership, 26 families did not pull up the grain. As a result, they were arrested again. On the night the "Kuomintang army" fled when the People's Liberation Army crossed the river, they were all buried alive. This kind of thing was extremely common in Juye. According to 28 people from Juye, the "Kuomintang army" had buried more than 4,000 people alive in the city alone in the past two months. This number is what is known to the people. As for the conspiracies and secret murders that the masses do not know about, it is impossible to calculate. It is a sinful miracle in human history that farmers planting crops have become criminals. From Qin Shi Huang in ancient China to the modern murderer Hitler, none have ever had this. But Chiang Kai-shek has made an astonishing creation. The purpose of this astonishing creation is to make it impossible for some people to survive, while only he and his servants can escape and survive. But the result will inevitably be contrary to his wishes. All those who cannot survive will eventually rise up to help the People's Liberation Army, so that none of you can escape and you will definitely not survive.

    拔了庄稼又逼粮
    鲁西前线蒋军暴行实纪  胡征
    人民解放军于六月三十日深夜，沿三百五十里黄河防线强渡而过，蒋军当夜从各个要塞和城市里夹着尾巴逃跑了。而这些畜牲们并没有放弃过一秒钟的时间，对人民进行着横暴的杀害与摧残。
    七月一号黎明，解放军来到蒋军刚逃走两小时后的韩庄，先头部队被一位叫韩起义的老汉，拦在村口上，痛哭流涕地控告起来了，他指着村外一片荒野告诉我们说：
    “俺只两亩半地的高粱，中央军硬叫拔光了………”
    从这位老汉的控诉中，我们知道：这地方在三天前，还是一片一人多高的浓密的高粱林，现在都变成一眼望不见边的凄惨的荒野了。青青的高粱秆散乱地躺在地上，成群的乌鸦在啄食半熟的黍米。拔高粱的命令是五天前颁发的，这道命令很厉害，曹州府第一道命令到各伪县府时，说是限三天以内，要把大路两边五里地和县城周围十里地以内的高粱，完全拔尽，完不成任务的按军法治罪，事实上谁都知道，冀鲁豫平原的大路象蛛网样稠密地交织着，大路与大路之间的距离，没有一个地方超过一里，于是伪县府的命令来的更其彻底，叫各村农民把所有的高粱全拔掉，他们的理由坦白而简单：“高粱隐眼，八路军来了望不见，国军跑时也不方便。”但无耻的畜牲们，并不以这种罪恶的措施为丑，在农民们恳求多少留一点的时候，反而厉声吆喝着：“这是命令！谁能管你饿死不饿死！国军来的时候，就叫你们别种高粱，你们自己一定要种，这怪谁呢？”
    今年春天，伪县府确实也下过这命令，显然地他们刚来到这里，就预知了自己的命运。可是高粱这东西在冀鲁豫平原人民说来是主要的食粮，高粱杆又是主要的燃料，老百姓能眼看着空下丰年地不种，又便等着自己饿死么？但这是老百姓的事，与“国军”毫无关系，“国军”的任务是一面下令禁种粮食，一面又下令催缴军粮，这真是人类历史上绝顶的暴政，千古少有的矛盾了。
    这矛盾表现在下列事实中，更为明显：曹州虎里头村，一百四十八户，五百三十二口人，蒋军是去年阴历九月来的，仅半年多时间，每亩征粮平均二十三斤，“自卫队”枪费共八百万，平均每户六万。吴庄每亩地平均二十一斤，枪费每亩地七千。鄄城古楼二十多户一百卅人，粮食和枪费共计折钱平均每人八万。定陶马庄，仅马应宗一家，遭殃军来时，说他通八路，把三十亩地一条牛和两石粮食卖光，花了五百七十万元，才算无罪。但财产虽卖，捐款照出，每亩地照例出粮二十五斤，枪费一千五，另外染工费，草鞋费……每月花样繁多，都得照例的出。然而，禁止种高粱的命令也就是催粮的老总们带到每一家去的。而且他们所要拔的并不只限于高粱，连谷子、豆子、红薯、瓜藤都得拔掉，什么庄稼长大了都不该存在，全得拔掉，他们的理由是：谷子大了也“隐眼”，而红薯、豆子、瓜藤的罪案则是“跑时绊脚”。七月四号，在曹州北德华区的张庄，记者亲眼看到公路两旁的瓜地，全都毁灭了，瓜藤瓜叶，沾满了黄色的沙土，受伤的半熟的西瓜甜瓜都被敲破了，有的踩得稀烂，一队人走过，绿头蝇轰然而起，这种惨痛的形象，谁见了都会激起愤怒！这一带的土地因地势低，土质坏，尽是沙，别的粮食都不易生长，今年天旱，瓜的收成较好，这一带的高粱少，谷子、红薯、豆子都没出来，无庄稼可拔，于是就轮到这些无罪的瓜藤了。
    记者去访问一家苦难的瓜地主人时，他已不在家了，他叫张明礼，全家六口靠几亩瓜地过日子的，瓜被拔时他就气疯了，不知跑那里去了，他的邻居告诉我，在拔瓜藤时，张明礼和他老婆给国军磕头，要求把瓜留着全家人还可以维持几个月的生活，一位“国军”的官长把他老婆的脸扭过来看了一下，照脸吐了一口唾沫说：“看你长的这样子，真够恶心！”于是下令把所有的瓜都踢破了，又把这个怀孕的女人踢了一顿。我走进这位被侮辱的家门，看见她躺在一块破席子上，已经奄奄一息了。这时候，我碰见另一个十九岁的青年，名叫袁××，他前天清早到集上卖瓜卖了四千元，被国军抓去送差，这村离曹州府二十五里，一路不叫休息，不叫喝一口水，把他们送到以后，又把全部瓜钱给掏去了。离这村二里地的花园村里，一个姓王的青年，送差的时候，因为天热，车子太重推不动，“国军”就照他大腿一刺刀，鲜血顺着裤子往下淌，但“国军”还用刺刀逼着他推了二里路。畜牲们的罪行是控诉不尽的，拔高粱的命令，象灭绝人类的天灾样，摧毁着农村，于是鄄城、曹州、定陶一带，各个城镇周围五里十里地以内，都变成了荒野。在十里内外还有些保存下来的庄稼，那都是经过了万分艰难的斗争的。沙卧村的张××告诉记者说：“命令催的怪急，谁都硬着脖子不拔，谁都知道八路军快来了！”在这种情形下，命令下了三道，第一道说：留一颗高粱，罚一颗子弹，第二天又一道命令：一颗高粱罚一支枪，第三道命令说三天之内不拔就枪毙，老百姓给他的回答是响亮的：“毙就毙吧，反正都是死！死也不拔！”可是第三道命令下来的第二天的夜晚，我们的炮声一响，下命令的人全都跑光，当天解放军就到了。
    在人民解放军不到达以前，农民们为保卫生命，进行了坚决的斗争，一个四十多岁的姓冯的农民告诉我，他有一个姐夫，六十多岁，家里卅几亩地，一条牛，“国军”一到就被抓住，说他儿子当八路军，经几个月的中人说合，花了五百多万，把地和牛全部卖光了。这次命令拔粮时，老人和邻居的另一位老人领导全村坚决抗命。在他们领导之下，有廿六家没有拔，于是又被抓住，在解放军渡河的夜晚“国军”逃跑时，把他们全都活埋了，这种事在鄄城是极其普遍的，据廿八个鄄城的人民告诉记者，“国军”最近两个月仅在城里就活埋了四千多人，这个数目还是人所共知的，至于群众所不知的阴谋暗害，那就无法计算了。农民种庄稼成了违法的罪犯，这是人类史上罪恶的奇迹，从中国远古的秦始皇，到近代的杀人魔王希特勒均未曾有过。而蒋介石却有了惊人的创造。这惊人创造的目的是：叫一些人民都活不下去，而只有他和他的臣仆们能跑掉、活下去。而其结果都必然事与愿违，一切活不下去的人们终将起来帮助人民解放军，打得你们一个也跑不掉，一定活不了。
