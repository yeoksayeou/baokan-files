    Xinhua Bookstore New Books Sell Well
    Half a Million Copies Sold in Six Months

    [This Newspaper] The Xinhua Bookstore's Distribution Section held a section meeting in the middle of last month to review the distribution work for the first half of the year. Each branch had a lot of experience and innovation. First, they took the initiative to find readers, implement universal and reasonable distribution, so that publications could be quickly delivered to readers. The branch stores' outlets attached importance to blackboard advertisements and new book briefings, and book catalog promotion methods. They universally carried out mobile supply, going to market towns and temple fairs, and to various rural schools, bringing different books according to different audiences. Some branches even organized enthusiastic readers to form reader clubs and reading groups. For example, the Handan branch sent people to Cixian for mobile sales, and in addition to selling books, they organized more than 300 reading groups (about 2,000 people). They collectively subscribed to the New Masses and established mail-order relationships. In addition, they paid attention to developing distribution work in new areas. After April, they organized mobile supply with the troops to Anyang and other places, so that the heroic fighting soldiers at the front could obtain cultural nourishment. In the past six months, a total of 184 new books have been published, totaling more than 566,000 copies, of which more than 540,000 copies have been sold, with the number of copies distributed accounting for 96% of the number published. In their work, everyone displayed enthusiasm and strived to be people's heroes. The wholesale team once had three people doing the work of five, and issued 15 new books within a week. Under their influence, the machine comrades also collectively performed meritorious service. (Zhen Hua)
