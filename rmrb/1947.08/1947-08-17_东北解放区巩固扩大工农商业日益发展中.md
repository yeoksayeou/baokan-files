Xinhua News Agency, Northeast, August 15th: On the second anniversary of the liberation of Northeast China, our correspondent reports the overall picture of the Northeast Liberated Area as follows: The Northeast Liberated Area, which has attracted attention both domestically and internationally, is being increasingly consolidated and expanded through the arduous efforts of our Northeast military and civilians, especially in the past year after the in-depth land reform and the continuous victorious offensives of the Democratic Allied Forces. Currently, except for a narrow strip along the southern section of the Changchun Railway and the Beining Railway occupied by Chiang's forces, the area stretches from the Tumen River directly to the Ussuri River, north to the banks of the Heilongjiang River, bordering the East Siberian Plain; to the west, it is adjacent to the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region (formerly Xing'an Province) across the Nenjiang River; to the south, it borders the Yalu River, with the Liaodong Peninsula protruding into the Yellow Sea and Bohai Sea, facing the Shandong Liberated Area across the sea; to the southwest, it is combined with the Hebei-Chahar-Rehe area, forming the entire powerful Northeast Liberated Area, controlling 8,368 kilometers of the entire Northeast border line and two-thirds of the 868 kilometers of coastline.

The entire area, under the jurisdiction of the Northeast Administrative Committee, the highest political power organ in the Northeast, has ten provinces: Songjiang, Hejiang, Nenjiang, Heilongjiang, Liaobei, Jilin, Andong, Liaoning, Mudanjiang (the new province formed by the merger of the original Mudanjiang Direct Administration Area and the Dong'an Administration Area of Hejiang Province), and Rehe (most of the original Rehe Province and the western Liaoning area from Jinzhou to Shanhaiguan), as well as two administrative offices: Jidong (all areas east of the Beining Railway in the original Hebei territory, north of Pinggu-Beikou, and Leting, Changli, and Luanxian between the Beining Railway and the Bohai Sea), and Jirecha (the area north of the Ping-Sui Railway, the Hebei area west of the Pinggu Railway in Chahar, and the western part of Rehe). It has the special municipality of Harbin, and four provincial-level cities: Andong, Qiqihar, Jiamusi, and Mudanjiang; forty special districts; two hundred and ten county governments (including some newly established counties in the liberated areas); thirty-two banner governments (equivalent to county governments); one thousand five hundred and seven district offices; and twenty-seven thousand and eighteen village governments. The area has increased to 674,667 square kilometers since the Democratic Allied Forces' summer offensive this year (including 135,000 square kilometers in Rehe, 52,980 square kilometers in Jidong, and 90,000 square kilometers in Jirecha), accounting for 90% of the total area of Northeast China (including Hebei-Chahar-Rehe), with a population of 33 million, accounting for over 70% of the total population of Northeast China. The length of railways in the liberated area outside the pass is 6,611 kilometers, accounting for 69.6% of the total railway lines in Northeast China. Larger villages and towns have postal agencies, which can communicate with all liberated areas in the country in addition to within the Northeast. The telegraph and telephone lines in the East, West, South and North Manchuria (total length of more than 2,670 kilometers) are connected to 124 telegraph and telephone bureaus, and medium-sized cities and above have automatic telephone equipment. Tap water and electric lights are used in most towns and cities. Industry and mining in various places have been gradually restored, and coal production has exceeded that of the puppet Manchukuo era. The liberated area has an abundant supply of coal, and light industries such as textiles, leather, papermaking, sawmills, and flour mills have sufficient raw materials. Since the beginning of summer, they have been carrying out a crash production to support the front lines. There are 10,085 primary and secondary schools in the entire area, with more than 925,500 students receiving democratic education, and the number of children of liberated peasants seeking education is increasing daily. The cultural undertakings of the new Northeast are also advancing by leaps and bounds. Newspapers in various cities have an average history of one year, and the Northeast Daily in Harbin is especially loved and welcomed by the general public. Commerce in various cities has developed. Recently, stores have been purchasing and transporting large quantities of cloth and daily necessities in preparation for selling them to peasants for the winter.

　　东北解放区巩固扩大工农商业日益发展中
    【新华社东北十五日电】东北解放两周年纪念日，本社记者报导东北解放区全貌如下：为国内外所注目的东北解放区，经我东北军民艰难创造，特别在最近一年来经过深入土地改革，及民主联军连续胜利攻势以后，正日益巩固与扩大。现除全区长春路南段与北宁路沿线一狭窄地带为蒋占区外，东起图门江直溯乌苏里江而上，北达黑龙江沿岸，与东部西伯利亚平原相接，西部隔嫩江与内蒙古自治区（原兴安省）毗邻，南沿鸭绿江，有辽东半岛突入黄海与渤海之间与山东解放区隔海相望；西南结合冀察热辽地区，构成整个强大东北解放区，控制东北全部国境线八千三百六十八公里，及海岸线八百六十八公里的三分之二。
    全区在东北最高政权机关——东北行政委员会管辖下，共有松江、合江、嫩江、黑龙江、辽北、吉林、安东、辽宁、牡丹江（原牡丹江直属专区与合江省之东安专区合并之新省）、热河（原热河省大部及锦州至山海关的辽西地区）十个省，及冀东（原河北境北宁路以北，平古北口）路以东全部地区，与北宁路及渤海间的乐亭、昌黎、滦县等地）、冀热察（平绥路以北，察境平古路以西之河北及热河之西部）两个行署。拥有哈尔滨特别市，与安东、齐齐哈尔、佳木斯、牡丹江四个省辖市，四十个专区，二百一十个县政府（其中包括解放区新设县若干），卅二个旗政府（相等于县政府），一千五百零七个区公所，二万七千零十八个村政府。面积至今年七月民主联军夏季攻势以后，增至六十七万四千六百六十七平方公里（内包括热河十三万五千方公里，冀东五万二千九百八十方公里，冀察热九万方公里），占东北全面积（冀察热辽在内）百分之九十人口三千三百里，占东北全人口百分之七十强。关外解放区铁路线长六千六百十一公里，占全东北铁路线百分之六十九点六。较大之村镇均有邮政局代办所，除东北境内外，并可与全国各解放区通邮。东西南北满（全长二千六百七十余公里之电报、电话线，联结于一百二十四个电报电话局，中等城市以上均有自动电话之设备。自来水与电灯用及于绝大部分的市镇。各地工矿业已次第恢复，煤的产量已超过伪满时代。解放区用煤充裕无虞，各地纺织。皮革、造纸、火锯、制粉等轻工业原料充足，入夏以来，正为支援前线而突击生产中。全区一万零八十五所大中小学校，计有九十二万五千五百余学生得受民主教育，翻身农民的子弟求学者日增。新东北之文化事业亦突飞猛进，各城镇之报章平均俱有一年历史，哈市之东北日报尤受一般群众之爱戴与欢迎。各都市之商业均有发展，最近各店家均纷纷购运大量布匹及日用品，准备售予农民过冬。
