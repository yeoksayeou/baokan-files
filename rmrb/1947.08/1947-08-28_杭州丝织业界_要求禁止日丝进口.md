　　Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 26th: Shanghai dispatch: The Chiang government's decision to open trade with Japan, and the subsequent announcement on the 20th of the "Items Permitted for Import and Export in Sino-Japanese Trade," which included allowing the import of Japanese rayon, has caused great anxiety among Shanghai's associated industries. It is recognized that in the past, the Four Great Families' company, the China Trust Bureau, etc., through "legal" forms of barter trade and illegal forms of smuggling of Japanese rayon, have already dealt a severe blow to the Chinese silk industry. In the future, the even greater dumping of Japanese silk will inevitably force China's silkworm farming and silk weaving industries into an even more desperate situation. Hangzhou, one of the centers of China's silk industry, has had a strong reaction to this. The Zhejiang Provincial Silk and Cocoon Industry Joint Conference in the city unanimously resolved on the 23rd to send a telegram to the Chiang government, demanding a ban on the import of Japanese silk and silk products, and strictly prohibiting their smuggling.
