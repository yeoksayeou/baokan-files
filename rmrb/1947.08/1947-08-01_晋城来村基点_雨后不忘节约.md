    Jincheng Lai Village Base Point
    Saving After the Rain
    [This newspaper's Jincheng dispatch] After completing the summer harvest within five days in the Jincheng County Second District Lai Village base point, West Gao Village, and other five administrative villages, there was a slight drizzle. Although the rainfall was insufficient, all temporary mutual aid teams were organized under the leadership of regular mutual aid teams to collectively rush to replant. Within four days, they replanted 3,003 mu of wheat stubble land with beans and 934 mu of fallow land with corn and other coarse grains. Just as another inch of light rain fell, the replanted late seedlings grew vigorously. If there is another rainfall soon, there is still great hope for the autumn harvest this year. As Li Maidan said, "Fortunately, the mutual aid teams planted it; otherwise, we would have missed this opportunity, and we wouldn't have anything to eat if we waited for a thorough rain!" At the same time, they are not relaxing their efforts in fighting drought, surviving the famine, promoting production, and practicing economy. In the past three days, they have collected a total of 20,069 jin of wild vegetables and caught 33 jin and 11 liang of black insects. Lai Village's female cadre, Niu Yu, and the old man, Niu Peide, from North Gao Village, have achieved great success in practicing economy. Niu Yu's family of four used to eat a total of two sheng of millet per day. Since returning from the district meeting on the 28th day of the lunar month, they began to save, and now they only need half a sheng of bran, one sheng of chaff, half a sheng of job's tears and coarse grains, and half a sheng of millet per day. In twenty days, they saved a total of one and a half dou of millet. She also personally collects 35 jin of vegetables every two days. She has influenced all the women in the village to learn from her. The Second District Production Committee issued a notice on July 13th, commending them throughout the district and calling on other villages to learn from the Lai Village base point villages.

    晋城来村基点
    雨后不忘节约
    【本报晋城讯】本县二区来村基点西郜村等五个行政村，普遍的在五天内完成夏收后，天气下了点微雨，虽然雨量不够，但组织了全部的临时互助组，在经常互助组的领导下，集体突击补种完毕。四天内计回麦茬地种豆三千零三亩，补种白地玉茭等杂粮共九百三十四亩，恰好又下了一寸小雨，补种的晚苗都茂盛的长起来了，若不久再有一场雨水，今年秋收仍希望很大，正如李麦旦说：“幸亏互助都种上了，不是还要误了这个机会，要是等透雨再种吃不上啦！”同时他们对于抗旱渡荒生产节约还是一点不放松，最近三天内共打野菜两万零六十九斤。共捉黑虫卅三斤十一两。来村妇女干部牛玉与北郜村牛培德老汉节约很有成绩，牛玉家中四口人，以前每日共吃小米二升，自从阴历上月二十八日从区上开会回来后，开始节约，每日只需麸半升，糠一升，茭子杂粮半升，米半升，在二十天共省下米一斗半，他个人每两日还采菜三十五斤，她影响了全村的妇女都起来向他学习了。二区生产委员会特于七月十三号通报全区表扬，并号召其他村向来村基点村学习。（王毅）
