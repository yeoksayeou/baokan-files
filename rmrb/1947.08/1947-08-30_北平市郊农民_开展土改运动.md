Xinhua News Agency, Jin-Cha-Ji, 27th: Farmers in the suburbs of Beiping are involved in the land reform movement. Villages such as Wanping and Huangchang, forty li west of Beiping, are implementing joint defense and liquidation. Although the villages of Guanjialing and Huangchang have been constantly harassed by Chiang's troops from Nankou and other places, the farmers have also liquidated seven large landlords and recovered more than 800 mu of land. Farmers from Lishisan Village and other villages, only twenty li away from Lugou Bridge, jointly liquidated the notorious evil monks of the Jietai and Tanzhe Temples, who had squeezed the blood and sweat of the surrounding dozens of villages, recovering assets worth 300,000 yuan. During a mass meeting, Chiang's troops from Lugou Bridge came out to harass, but were jointly repelled by the masses and local troops, with more than 30 killed or wounded. In Jiatai Village, Changwan (newly established county between Changping and Wanping), special agent landlords, under the instruction of Chiang's special agents at the nearby Yangfang stronghold last month, armed themselves to resist land reform and brutally killed two cadres of the village work team. However, the resistance was immediately suppressed by the militia, and the masterminds were captured. The movement is now developing comprehensively in various regions.
