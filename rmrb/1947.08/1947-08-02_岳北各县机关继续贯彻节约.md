    [This newspaper, Taiyue, 31st dispatch] The production and thrift movement in Yuebei continues to deepen. The seven shops and one woolen mill managed by the Finance Office, consisting of over two hundred staff and workers, voluntarily proposed to reduce salaries and food expenses, and stepped up production to achieve self-sufficiency in firewood and charcoal. Salary reductions alone are expected to save over 3 million yuan by the end of the year. In addition, they also take time to engage in transportation and pig raising, and other sideline occupations. By the end of the year, they are expected to produce 13 million yuan, which will not only solve the miscellaneous expenses and food costs of the agencies, but also ensure that each person contributes 2,000 yuan to the public. In order to rectify finances, Huo County has also established a Local Grain and Funds Consolidation Committee, led personally by County Head Chen and Political Commissar Guan. After inspection, it was found that 1,421 *shi* of local grain can be reduced this year. The Consolidation Committee also stipulated that no agency is allowed to arbitrarily dispatch a single penny without the permission of the committee, and no expenses exceeding the budget will be incurred. After the Qinxian government clarified erroneous understanding of the issues of saving, production and famine preparedness, cadres actively participated in production. Over 20 *mu* of autumn crops have been fully seeded and weeded. Sideline production of lime earned over 100,000 *yang*.
    [This newspaper, Jinnan, 31st dispatch] Yuanchao launched a campaign to promote production and thrift. After the district and village cadres' meeting to commend and evaluate merit, the cadres' enthusiasm was vigorous, and a large-scale production and thrift movement was widely launched. After the cadres of Xiaogong Village, Beisha Village, in the Second District, returned to the village, they immediately convened branch meetings, village cadre meetings, and mass meetings to mobilize and organize mutual aid in production. The masses voluntarily organized five groups, with five village cadres participating in one group each. Under challenging and intensive work, they completed the planting of all the barren land in the village in two days. Then, the five groups went to the fields together and hoed 97 *mu* of seedlings in one day. The head and deputy head of the Armed Committee of Qianbaozhuang in the Fourth District convened a general meeting of militiamen. Twenty-eight militiamen unanimously resolved to abstain from tobacco and alcohol, not to go to the market or attend meetings unless necessary, and not to ask the Self-Defense Force to cultivate their fields on their behalf when they go on expeditions, but to cultivate them mutually themselves. Thanks to their collective labor, late seedlings have been completely planted, and spring seedlings have been hoed four times. In order to promote the production and thrift movement in the whole village, the director of the Armed Committee convened a mass meeting, introducing the achievements of the militiamen's thrift and mutual aid. Under the influence of the militiamen, the two people selling foreign cigarettes also quit. The masses voluntarily organized eighteen mutual aid groups. After the cadres of Hanzhuang Village returned to the village, they expressed their attitudes to each other, determined to practice thrift and participate in mutual aid. After several days of mobilization and coordination, 69 people voluntarily formed nine mutual aid groups, and the village cadres all went to the groups to participate in production. The production and thrift movement has greatly developed in the eight villages of Quanzhuang District, with a total of over 1.78 million *yuan* saved in ten days in the eight villages.
