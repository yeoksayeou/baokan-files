　　Large Se Village Adjusts Labor Force and Repairs Farm Tools
  　Actively Prepares for Autumn Harvest and Wheat Planting
    [Reported by our reporter group on the 26th] Farmers in Da Se Village, Xingtai New District, held a meeting on the night of the 22nd to plan for the autumn harvest. First, they accurately calculated and organized the labor force by group. The Wang Shu mutual aid group has a total of nineteen households and twenty laborers, cultivating fifty-eight mu of millet. It is estimated that each mu will require two labor days to harvest, totaling one hundred and sixteen labor days, which can be completed in five days and two afternoons. In the past, without mutual aid, it took three labor days to harvest one mu of millet per day, so fifty-eight mu of millet would require one hundred and seventy-four labor days to harvest. This year, just for harvesting millet alone, fifty-eight labor days will be saved. Wang Tong said, "In the past, there were women helping with the harvest of more than one mu of millet in the west of our village. It took two and a half days just to cut the stalks and shave the ears, and another two afternoons to carry it home. With mutual aid, more than one mu of millet can be harvested in one day. What a difference!" After discussing the labor organization problem, they then discussed other specific issues. Gao He, the mutual aid group leader, said, "In the past, there was little land, and the furniture could be used together. This year, with more land, the furniture can't be used together. I calculated that our group alone is short of six sickles and five hoes, which need to be bought immediately. In addition, two new threshing floors need to be built." Ren Xuewen said, "Our group has already made six hoes, four sickles, and two wooden shovels." Feng Ling said, "My threshing floor is small, and I need to expand it a bit this year. Our group has a broken cart that needs to be repaired." After discussion and statistics, there are currently twenty carts. In addition to repairing four broken carts, three more carts, eighty-four sickles, forty-three hoes, twenty-one wooden shovels, thirty brooms, twenty-six circle mats (for circling public grain), and thirty-seven cloth bags need to be manufactured or purchased. The original one hundred and ten old threshing floors are not enough, and thirty new threshing floors need to be rolled. (Zhu Bo)
    [Reported by our reporter group on the 26th] Farmers in Da Se Village, Xingtai, are actively preparing for wheat planting. The village is severely short of fertilizer. This year, they plan to apply at least two large carts of fertilizer to each mu of wheat land, but they currently only have four hundred and sixty carts, which is far from enough. If each laborer makes two large carts of green manure, one hundred and seventy-two laborers can make three hundred and forty-eight large carts. All eleven large hemp composting pits in the village can be used to make fertilizer with hemp soaking water, green grass, and soil. Each pit can hold at least forty large carts, for a total of four hundred and forty large carts. Forty head of livestock, each accumulating four large carts, can accumulate one hundred and sixty large carts. Including the existing ones, there are a total of one thousand four hundred and eight large carts of fertilizer, enough for seven hundred and four mu of land. However, half of the wheat land is still short of fertilizer. The farmers discussed and decided that everyone should work together to weave more dustpans, engage in transportation, and earn dividends to buy cottonseed cakes. Each household will also accumulate some ash soil and manure to make up for the shortfall. Gao Wenzeng alone has already made four carts of green manure. He recently dug a manure pond that can hold six large carts of green manure. In terms of farm tools, the village is still short of thirteen seed drills, ten plows, twenty-one and a half rakes, and nineteen harrows, which are currently being repaired. The mutual aid groups are also planning to buy one more set. All two hundred and two mu of reserved wheat land in the village are planned to be plowed four times, and have now been plowed twice. The one thousand two hundred and fifty mu of stubble wheat land is planned to be plowed twice and harrowed and raked twice each. (Zhu Bo)

　　大色调整劳力添修农具
  　积极准备秋收种麦
    【本报记者团二十六日电】邢台新区大色村农民，二十二日夜集会计划秋收。首先以组为单位，精确计算与组织劳动力。王书互助组共十九户，二十个劳力，种五十八亩谷子，收割时每亩预计需用两个工，共需一百一十六个工，五天零两晌即可收完，过去不互助，三个工一天才收一亩谷，五十八亩谷就需要一百七十四个工才能收割罢，今年仅收割谷子一项，就省了五十八个工。王通说：“我村西一亩多谷子，往年有女人帮收，割谷秆削谷穗就得两天半时间，往家里连需要两大晌，互助起来，一亩多谷一天就割完了，这相差多远。”把劳力组织问题讨论完了，接着讨论其他具体问题，互助组长高合小说：“往年地少，家具可以凑合着用，今年地多了，家具就不能凑合啦。我算着，光俺一个组就缺镰六张、镢头五个，这些都需要马上买，另外还得碾两个新场。”任学文说：“俺那组现在就制了六个镢，四张镰，两张木锨。”凤陵说：“我的场小，今年要向外扩展点，俺组一辆破大车，要修理修理才行。”经过讨论统计，现有二十辆大车，把四辆坏车修整外，还要制造或添买三辆大车、八十四张镰、四十三个镢，二十一张木锨，三十把扫帚，圈席（圈公粮用的）二十六个，布袋三十七条，原有一百一十个旧场不够用，还得轧三十个新场。（朱波）
    【本报记者团二十六日电】邢台大色村农民，积极进行种麦准备工作。该村肥料甚缺，今年计划每亩麦地最少上两大车肥，现在才有四百六十大车，差数太远，如每个劳动力造两大车青肥，一百七十二个劳力可造三百四十八大车，全村十一个大沤麻坑，用沤麻水加青草和土造肥，每坑最少四十大车，共可沤四百四十大车，四十头牲口，每头积四大车，可积一百六十大车，连原有者共一千四百零八大车肥料，够七百零四亩地用，但尚有半数麦地缺肥，农民们讨论结果是，大家动手多编簸箕，搞运输，赚了红利买花籽饼，每家再积些灰土及大粪以补不足。光高文增一人，现已造成四车青肥，他日前又掘了一个粪池，可盛六大车青肥。农具方面，全村还缺十三张耧、十个犁、二十一个半耢、十九个耙，现在正设法修补中。互助组里还计划添买一部。全村二百零二亩留麦地，准备都犁过四遍，现已犁过两遍，茬子种麦地一千二百五十亩，准备犁两遍、耙耢各两遍。（朱波）
