　　【This newspaper, Taiyue, 22nd dispatch】Lujiahe in Yancheng, after summarizing production last time, discovered a large amount of surplus labor had not been fully utilized. Cadres like Lu Sihe first drafted their own household's production plan for the second half of the year, addressing surplus labor. He presented this plan at a meeting for everyone to discuss, promoting household-by-household planning throughout the village. Each household first planned how much labor would be used for farming in the second half of the year, then planned the daily necessary labor consumption, such as cooking, childcare, making clothes, etc. Surplus labor was completely planned for sideline occupations to increase income. Of the 60 households in the village, the team summarized each household's plan, which became the team's production plan. The village has a total of 23,895 labor days in the second half of the year. Farming can only use 5,481 labor days, accounting for 22.9 percent of the total labor days. Men will bear 4,031 and women will bear 1,450 labor days. It is also necessary to ensure that no land is left idle, striving for four weedings for millet and three weedings for corn, striving for a ten-tenth harvest in an eight-tenth year. Daily consumption uses 8,851 labor days, accounting for 37.1 percent of the total labor days, a decrease of 22 percent compared to the first half of the year. Men will bear 3302.5 and women will bear 5548.5 labor days. Surplus labor will be used for sideline production, totaling 9,558 labor days, accounting for 40 percent of the total labor days, an increase of 21 percent compared to the first half of the year. To strengthen the leadership of sideline occupations, the masses elected Lu Sihe as the head of the sideline production team. Everyone also decided that in order for sideline occupations to serve agriculture, all sideline production in the village will be suspended during the busy farming season, and will resume after the busy farming season. In this way, agriculture can be done well, and sideline occupations can also be done well. In this way, the average sideline income per person in the second half of the year can reach more than 20,000 yuan, an increase of more than three times compared to the first half of the year.
　　【This newspaper, Jinnan, 22nd dispatch】Linqing Eighth District is taking advantage of agricultural downtime to carefully calculate and develop sideline occupations, planning to get through the spring famine next year. After Linqing Eighth District held a production and thrift meeting, twelve village cadres from Xiaozhai and one teacher were assigned to work with each household to make household-by-household plans. The method was to calculate this year's income and expenditures, and understand that out of the 145 households in the village, only 32 households had enough grain to eat. The remaining 113 households, with 540 people, were short an average of one month's worth of grain for next spring, totaling 50,000 jin of grain. Therefore, a mass meeting was convened to explain this situation. Then, they called on everyone to live frugally and vigorously engage in sideline occupations. After the meeting, village cadres went door-to-door to mobilize people to lower their living standards and engage in sideline occupations to earn grain. This targeted approach has achieved great results. According to statistics from the last ten days, 22 households have already mixed bran and vegetables into their diet and no longer eat white flour. Forty-five people have stopped smoking foreign cigarettes and switched to smoking domestic tobacco. There were originally 11 sideline workshops, etc., and now 8 more have been added, including milling rooms, cotton ginning bows, mills, and oil presses. It is estimated that the 19 sideline occupations will earn 2.07 million yuan by the end of the lunar year, which can buy 34,500 jin of red sorghum at the current market price. In addition, 6,000 jin of yam leaves can be collected, and adding some bran can save another 6,000 jin of grain. In this way, the 113 grain-deficient households are actually short only 9,500 jin. If these sideline occupations continue until next spring, in addition to supplementing the grain shortage, there will be surplus grain. The masses have full determination and confidence to overcome the famine.

　　精确计算营生余工充分使用
  　卢家河农副业增产
    临清八区利用农业空隙发展副业
    【本报太岳二十二日电】阳城岩山卢家河上次总结生产中发现大量余工尚未充分使用，干部卢思河等首先订出自己家后半年生产计划，处理余工，在大会上让大家讨论推动了全村按家计划。各家都先计划后半年种地共用多少工，再计划日常必须消耗的工，如做饭看小孩、做衣服等，余工完全计划搞副业，增加收入。全村六十户，分队把各家计划归纳起来，就成为分队生产计划。全村后半年共有工二万三千八百九十五个，种地只能用工五千四百八十一个，占总工数百分之二十二点九，男人担负四千零三十一个，妇女担负一千四百五十个，还要做到不留一块闲地，争取谷锄四遍，玉茭锄三遍，八成年景争取十成收。日常消耗用工八千八百五十一个，占总工数百分之三十七点一，较前半年减少百分之二十二，男担负三千三百零二又五分，女担负五千五百四十八又五分。余工搞副业生产，共九千五百五十八个工，占总工数百分之四十，较前半年增加百分之二十一。为加强副业领导，群众并选出卢思河担任副业生产分队长。大家又决定：为了副业服从农业，农忙时，全村一切副业生产停止，农忙过后再开始，这样农业能做好，副业也能做好，如此，后半年副业收入每人平均可达到二万元以上，较上半年增加三倍以上。
    【本报冀南二十二日电】临清八区利用农事空隙正算帐发展副业，计划渡过明年春荒。临清八区召开生产节约大会后，肖寨十二个村干和教员一人即分工到各户作按家计划，方式是计算今年的收支，了解全村一百四十五户中只有三十二户粮食够吃，一百十三户五百四十人平均缺明春一个月的粮食，共计缺粮五万斤。于是便召开群众会，把这情形讲了以后，遂号召节衣缩食大力搞副业。会后村干再分头挨户动员，降低生活搞副业赚粮食。这样对症下药的作法，收到很大效果。据最近十几天统计，该村已有二十二户掺糠菜，没有再吃白面的了，有四十五人不吸洋烟，改吸旱烟，原有副业作坊等十一处，现又添轧房、弹花弓、磨坊、油坊等八处，十九处副业至旧历年底估计能赚二百零七万元，按目前市价能买红粮三万四千五百斤。另外能采山药叶六千斤，再掺些糠，又省六千斤粮食，如此一百十三户缺粮户实际上缺九千五百斤。如这些副业坚持到明春，除补充粮食不足外，还能有余粮，群众对渡荒有充分决心与信心。
