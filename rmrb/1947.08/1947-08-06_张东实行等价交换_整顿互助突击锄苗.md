    Zhang Dong Implements Equivalent Exchange
    Rectifies Mutual Aid, and Launches Crash Hoeing
    [Our Newspaper] During the wheat harvest, Zhang Dong Village in Xingtai organized thirty-two groups, which played a significant role. However, after the wheat harvest, due to the cadres' lack of experience in leading mutual aid, everything collapsed. This time, the leadership proposed rectifying mutual aid and launching a crash hoeing campaign. They held a mobilization meeting and pointed out that the first step in rectifying mutual aid was to solve the issue of equivalent exchange. After discussion, three types of thinking were identified: First, some people knew that mutual aid was good, but their land was large and their labor force was small, so they were afraid of paying wages; second, some "well-to-do" households disliked the quality of hoeing done by others and were unwilling to participate in mutual aid; third, some poor farmers were afraid that others would consider them lazy, so they preferred to work on their own land as they pleased. After identifying these ideas, the leadership proposed that mutual aid is an equivalent exchange, and paying wages is not a loss, but can be used to earn work points, not just begging for rice. Well-to-do households should not be conservative with their skills but should take apprentices and act as teachers. Poor farmers, as long as they work hard, can contribute whatever they can. Others will not dislike them, and not participating in mutual aid means wasting land. After dispelling these concerns, the next day, everyone was organized again, and within three days, all the seedlings in the village were hoed. Now there are twenty-eight groups, and twenty-five groups are implementing equivalent exchange. Currently, the groups are planting radishes and vegetables on a large scale.
    Hoeing Seedlings While Rush Planting
    Tan Village experienced a two-finger rainfall on the 24th of last month. The chairman of the farmers' association believed that this would guarantee planting, so he led the entire group to plant late crops, planting eighty-six mu in one and a half days. This motivated the entire village, and they planted four hundred mu in two days. The north half of the street previously planted crops, and this time, taking advantage of the hoeing of seedlings, they hoed three hundred mu in one day. Now all the seedlings have been hoed.
    Dongbaishan Groups Set Plans Guaranteeing Four Hoeings of Seedlings
    The 7th and 5th groups of Dongbaishan and others have successively set plans for competition, first ensuring that the families of soldiers are well taken care of, and not facing difficulties in burning firewood and getting water. Seedlings will be hoed four times to see who hangs up their hoes first. The 5th group plans to use the remaining labor force to engage in carpentry, and the 7th group proposes to do carrying and transportation, and also earn more money from livestock transportation than other groups. The whole group of fifteen laborers will also make one hundred loads of green manure. Because the 7th group is a militia group, they will also take time to practice martial arts. The 5th and 7th groups have proposed to step up weaving and strive not to wear foreign cloth. Currently, a vigorous production competition has been launched in the whole village.
    North Tang Village Replants Two Thousand Mu and Collects Sixty Shi of Small Persimmons Two Days After Hailstorm
    After the hailstorm in North Tang Village, in order to make up for the poor harvest, the whole village took action. Men seized the time to replant late crops, while women and children went to pick up the fallen small persimmons. In two days, all the land was replanted, totaling more than two thousand mu, and more than sixty-four shi of small persimmons were collected. (Xingtai "Path to Prosperity" Small Newspaper.)

    张东实行等价交换
    整顿互助突击锄苗
    【本报讯】邢台张东在麦收时，全村组织起来三十二个组，麦收中很起作用，过麦后由于干部领导互助没经验，全垮台了。这次领导上提出整顿互助，突击锄苗，在大会上作了动员，提出整顿互助首先要解决等价问题，经过讨论，发现有三种思想：一、有部分群众知道互助好，但他的地多，劳力少，怕出工资；二、有些好受家，嫌别人给他锄的不好，不愿互助；三、有些种地差的，怕别人嫌他懒，还不如自己给自己干随便。发现这些思想后，领导上提出：互助是等价交换，出工资并不吃亏，可争取还工，不是背着口袋要米，好受家不要保守技术，应当带徒弟，当老师。种地差的只要好好干，能顶几分算几分，别人不会嫌自己，不互助随便要荒地。这样打通群众思想，第二天又全部组织起来，三天将全村小苗锄完，现在有二十八个组，二十五个组实行等价交换，现各组正大量种萝卜菜。
    一面锄苗一面抢种
    谈村上月二十四日下了二指雨，农会主席认定这回保证能种，就领导全组种晚庄稼，一天半种了八十六亩，推动了全村，两天种了四百亩，北半街上次种的，这次趁垧锄苗，一天就锄了三百亩，现已把全部小苗锄完。
    东柏山各组订计划  保证小苗锄四遍
    东柏山第七、第五组等纷纷订计划竞赛，首先保证把军属照顾周到，烧柴吃水不受困难，小苗通锄四遍，看谁早挂锄钩，五组计划剩余劳力搞木匠，七组提出担挑运输，还要比别组牲口运输多赚钱。全组十五个劳力，并造青肥一百担，因七组是民兵组，并要抽空练武，五、七组都提出加紧纺织，争取不穿外来布，现全村生产竞赛热烈展开。
    北唐村受雹后两天补种两千亩拾小柿子六十石
    北唐村这次遭雹灾后，为了弥补歉收，全村总行动起来，男人抓紧时间补晚庄稼，妇女、儿童都去拾打落的小柿子，两天时间，全部补种完，共地两千余亩，拾小柿子六十四石多。（邢台发家之道小报。）
