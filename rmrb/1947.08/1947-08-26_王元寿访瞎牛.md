　　Wang Yuanshou Visits Blind Niu
    Wang Ziye · Booker
    Baiquan in the seventh district of Pingding is a village of more than 700 households. After its recent liberation, the village administration remained in the hands of bad elements from the enemy-puppet era. Therefore, although 36 villages united for struggle, the bad elements sabotaged it, resulting in 35 villages concentrating their struggle on Baiquan. Baiquan was labeled as a traitor village, making the masses feel insecure. When the work team from Pingding County arrived, the masses were suspicious, and the rumors spread by the traitors made the masses even more reluctant to approach the work personnel. Wang Yuanshou, Shi Wenchen, and other leaders of the work team decided to work hard on the poor to break the deadlock. Old Wang (referring to Wang Yuanshou) first toured Baiquan for two days, but no one dared to say anything when he went to their homes. Old Wang couldn't help but feel a little anxious. Finally, he learned that there was a Blind Niu's family, who had been begging for food for two generations. Old Wang ran to Blind Niu's home in one breath. It was a dilapidated cave dwelling with a sick little girl sleeping on the kang. Her clothes had many holes, and the cave emitted a strange smell. Old Wang felt a little uneasy; it was okay to be unfastidious (note), but being with a sick person might lead to illness. But then he thought, serving the masses means you can't worry about getting sick. So, Old Wang said he wanted to stay at his house. Blind Niu was an old man in his fifties with a grizzled beard. He initially knew that Old Wang was a cadre and couldn't figure him out, feeling quite uneasy, but seeing that Old Wang was dressed like the common people, like a peasant from a poor background, he didn't think there was anything to fear. So Old Wang stayed with Blind Niu in the kitchen. Old Wang first chatted with him, asking if the cadres here were good. Blind Niu said, "Not bad, we are beggars, who can short us? Only adding, not subtracting." Hearing this, Old Wang thought he couldn't rush things and temporarily changed the subject. Blind Niu's child was sick in bed and wanted to drink some rice soup, but there was no rice. Old Wang said, "I get thirty taels of rice a day. I haven't eaten bran porridge for two years. I'll give the rice for our children to eat." Blind Niu and his family were extremely grateful. So Old Wang ate whatever Blind Niu ate; Old Wang went to the fields with him. For three days in a row, Old Wang didn't mention anything about asking about their suffering. There were many weeds in the field. Old Wang said, "There are so many weeds in your field." Blind Niu sighed and said, "I only have two mu of 'cat's eye open' land that doesn't grow much. I'm always begging outside, with no labor or fertilizer, so how can it not be barren?" Old Wang said, "That's what you say, but the landlords will say: Blind Niu deserves his bad luck, even two mu of land is left barren." Then Old Wang said, "I worked as a hired laborer for more than thirty years. In the summer, the boss's family drank watermelon juice, followed by his wife and children. We also drank—plain boiled water." He also said, "Working as a hired laborer, you starved to death or suffered to death. Actually, working as a hired laborer is just begging inside the door." Old Wang's words touched Blind Niu's heart. Over the three days, Old Wang and Blind Niu became more and more friendly. By the fourth day, Blind Niu's heart began to change. When Old Wang talked to him about the landlords' crimes, Blind Niu glared and said, "That year, the ghost Qi Mao (Deng Fu) in our village didn't use the people from our village to build his house. He said that using people from other villages, they would leave a pile of manure after eating. Using people from our village, they would go back to their homes after eating. Even the poor people's assholes are still being exploited." Old Wang then calculated how much his eldest child had been cheated while working as a hired laborer. After calculating, the landlord's family owed him twelve shi of grain over four years. This calculation woke Blind Niu up. He jumped up and wanted to settle accounts with the landlord's family. Old Wang then said to him, "Only adding, not subtracting, right or wrong?" Blind Niu shook his head and said, "I was confused." Through Blind Niu's connections, he finally brought up all the poor peasants in the village.

　　王元寿访瞎牛
    王子野·布克
    平定七区白泉，是个七百多户的村子，这次新获解放后，因为村政权仍把持在敌伪时代的坏分子手中，所以虽然有三十六个村联合斗争，但在坏分子破坏下，结果形成三十五村集中斗争白泉。说白泉是汉奸村，弄得群众人人自危。平定县的工作团去了，群众心存疑惧，加上奸人造谣，群众更不敢和工作人员接近。工作团的领导同志王元寿、石文臣等，决定在穷人身上用苦功来打开僵局。老王（指王元寿）先在白泉串游了两天，但走到谁家，谁家都什么也不敢说，老王不免有些焦急。最后好容易才知道有个瞎牛家，已要了两辈子的饭，老王就一口气跑到瞎牛家。一孔破烂不堪的窑洞，炕上睡着个生病的小女孩，身上的衣服，有多少窟窿，洞里发出一股怪气味。老王心下有些咕，四不嫌（注）可以，和病人在一起可会招下病来；但转念一想，为群众服务讲不得招病不招病，老王就说要在他家住。瞎牛是个五十开外的老汉，花白胡子，他开始知道老王是干部，一时摸不清，心下着实不安，但看老王穿着和老百姓一样，像个受苦出身的庄稼人，也觉得没有什么可怕。于是老王就和瞎牛在厨房里住下了，老王先和他扯拉，问到这里干部好不好，瞎牛说：“不赖，咱是要饭的，谁能短下咱，只有长化没有短欠”。听这话头老王想不能急，暂时转到别的话头上去。瞎牛的孩子病在床上想喝点米汤，没有米，老王说：“我一天领三十两米，二年没吃糠糊糊饭，可把米来给咱孩儿们吃”。瞎牛两口感激不尽，于是瞎牛作什么饭，老王也跟着吃什么饭；瞎牛下地，老王也跟他下地，一连三天老王没有提到问苦的事。地里的草很多，老王说：“你这地这么些草”。瞎牛叹口气说：“咱只有二亩‘猫眼睁’也不长的地，咱成天在外讨饭，没工没粪，指甚不荒？”老王说：“你是这么说，财主们可又会说：瞎牛该倒运，二亩地还荒下个这。”接着老王又说：“我扛了三十多年长工，夏天里掌柜家喝着西瓜水，接着是老婆孩子喝。咱也喝——喝的是白开水。”又说：“扛长工饿了饿死，受了受死。实际扛长工就是门里要饭。”老王的话句句打动了瞎牛的心，在三天中，老王和瞎牛一天天亲切了，到第四天，瞎牛的心眼开始变了，老王和他谈起地主的罪恶，瞎牛就瞪眼说：“那年咱村的鬼七毛（邓富）修盖房子就不用本村的人，他告诉说，用下外村的人，吃上能落堆粪，用上本村的人，吃上就回他家去，穷人的屁眼也还要受剥削哩。”老王接着就和他算他大小孩给人扛长工的帐，算来算去，四年工夫财主家亏他十二石粮。这一算可把瞎牛算醒了，他跳起来要去和财主家算去，老王再向他说：“只有咱长化，没有缺欠，对也不对？”瞎牛摇手说：“那是我糊涂。”经过瞎牛的串连，终于把全村穷苦农民带起来了。
    （注）四不嫌：一不嫌糠面饭，二不嫌衣服破烂，三不嫌铺破席片，四不嫌虱蚤咬。（新华社冀察晋电）
