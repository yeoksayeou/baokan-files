    Ye County Cadres and Masses Persist in Their Positions
    Heroically Fight to Protect Labor and Grain

    [Reported from Ye County] After the Liu-Deng army went south, the enemy puppets and local bandits of Zhangde took the opportunity to operate more than twenty miles around the city, seizing labor,抢抢抢 grain, and livestock. For example, in Dafosi Village, in the Fourth District, the enemy抢抢抢 robbed 20,000 jin of grain in two days. In light of this situation, the leadership proposed launching a "Three Protections" movement: not allowing the enemy to搶抢抢 rob a single grain of grain or capture a single person. The county established two command headquarters, north and south. The cadres and militia of each district, as well as the militia battalion from Cixian County, were dispatched to the front-line districts and villages to carry out cold-gun battles, ambush warfare, and explosive operations. In half a month, there were more than twenty battles of various sizes (including two repelling sieges of battalion strength or more), killing and wounding more than forty enemies. Statistics from four villages show that more than 300 people, grain, livestock, and property seized by the enemy were rescued. Many model deeds emerged during the struggle. For example, Comrade Li Wenhua of the County Rescue Federation and public security officers Zhang Yangui and Xing Shanghua were surrounded by the enemy in Zhaoguantun. The three comrades were determined and resolutely resisted the enemy from a building, from night to morning, until Zhao Lianrong, a demobilized soldier from Yiliupo Village, brought a dozen militiamen to support them. They attacked the enemy from inside and outside, repelling the enemy without any losses on our side. In addition, the militia of the Fourth District cooperated with the militia of Linzhang to ambush the enemy near Aiting Village, wounding more than twenty enemies. The joint defense militia of Guocun 集 fought against the enemy in eight or nine battles of various sizes in a dozen days. Comrade Li Tianrang led a dozen militiamen to actively attack the enemy, killing one enemy,夺回夺回 two mules for the masses, and rescuing sixty or seventy people who had been captured. (Dé Quán)
