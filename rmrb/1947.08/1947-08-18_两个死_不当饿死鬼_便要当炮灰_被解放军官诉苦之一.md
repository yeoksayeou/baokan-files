　　Two Deaths
　　Better Not to Be a Starving Ghost
　　Than to Be Cannon Fodder
　　--Complaints from a Liberated Army Officer (1)
　　(Recorded by Hai Tao)
　　--In 1946, during the troop reorganization, I was kicked out of the 74th Army (it hadn't been changed to a division yet). The reason for being declared surplus was simply "no backing!" Alas, eight years of the War of Resistance resulted in this. Later, I was assigned to the 17th Army Officer Training Corps in Wuxi, where I suffered even more injustice and anger. A captain was reassigned as a lieutenant, and my salary was reduced to 80%. The vicious Chiang Kai-shek said he would demobilize us, but in reality, he wouldn't let us go. We were just left in that "nursing home" (as everyone called the officer training corps), eating and waiting to die. It was truly mind-numbing!

　　At that time, the "Da Xi Bao" and "Xi Bao" newspapers in Wuxi not only didn't speak up or appeal for us, but they actually scolded us: "They are similar to soldiers, but they didn't contribute anything in the War of Resistance, so the country doesn't need them. There are even bad elements among them!" These conscienceless people talked nonsense, which was unbearable. Everyone was so angry that they went to beat up the newspaper office. As a result, that ever-defeated general, Tang Enbo, immediately summoned us and scolded us: "You even beat up the newspaper office, what qualifications do you have? Why were you demobilized? Do you know? What are you being so arrogant about!" He also said that the government compensated the two newspapers 50 million yuan for this matter. Afterwards, we learned that the Ministry of National Defense actually took 100 million yuan because of this incident. They only gave the newspapers 30 million, and Tang Enbo pocketed as much as 70 million for himself.

　　My classmates were all indignant, and everyone said: "Damn it! If they don't let us live, we'll just go into Taihu Lake!" The people at the newspaper office used to be traitors, but now they are insulting anti-Japanese officers. Who would have thought that this "muddled head" would actually support these evil gangs? It got to the point where anti-Japanese soldiers were not qualified to beat traitors, but traitors were qualified to scold us. At that time, we really wanted to beat Tang Enbo again, but due to the suppression of violence, we could only dare to be angry but not speak out!

　　As soon as the civil war broke out, Chiang Kai-shek immediately wanted us to supplement the troops as cannon fodder. The first time, he tricked away a batch of us, saying we were going to serve in the Northeast. Soon, news came that many comrades had already become victims of the civil war. Those of us who hadn't left felt chilled to the bone! What kind of country is this? If they don't need us, they won't even let us eat our fill. If they need us, they make us be cannon fodder for them!

　　Alas! China is fortunate to have a Mao Zedong, otherwise, we would either "starve to death" or "die in battle." Therefore, my classmates are all very grateful to Chairman Mao. We once bravely posted a big slogan at the gate of the Nanjing National Government: "This road is blocked, go find benefactor Mao Zedong!" This is everyone's intention. Now, sure enough, Mao Zedong has rescued us from the fire pit, and we have finally been liberated.

### 两个死　不当饿死鬼　便要当炮灰——被解放军官诉苦之一

  　不当饿死鬼
  　便要当炮灰
    ——被解放军官诉苦之一
    （海涛记）
    ——三十五年部队整编，我从七十四军（那时还未改师）被踢了出来，编余的原因没有别的，就是“没有后台”！唉，八年抗战结果落了个这。以后，我又被编到无锡的十七军官总队去，从此罪和气就受得更多啦：上尉给核成中尉，薪金被减到八成，贼心狠毒的蒋介石嘴里说让我们复员，实际上又不放，就成天价给放在那“养老院”（大家给军官总队起的名字）里混饭吃等死，真教人脑筋伤透了！
    那时无锡的大锡报和锡报，不但不替我们诉苦、呼吁，反而骂我们：“类似军人，在抗战中也没有啥功，所以国家不用他们了，里面甚至有坏分子存在！等等；”这些丧尽天良的人胡说八道，实在令人受不了。大家气愤不过就去打报馆，结果那个常败将军汤恩伯，马上就召集我们臭骂一顿说：“你们还打报馆，有个啥资格？你们为什么被编下来？知道不？还有什么猖狂的！”他又说政府为这件事给两家报馆赔了五千万元，事后据我们了解，军政部确因此事而拿了一万万元，他们只给报馆三千万，汤恩伯独入私囊者即达七千万。
    同学们因此人人皆愤愤不平，大家都说：他妈的×呵！不让我们活，我们就往太湖里啦！”报馆的人员过去都是汉奸，现在竟然污辱抗日军官，想不到这“混汤头”还给这些狐群狗党们撑腰：弄得抗日军人打汉奸没资格，而汉奸骂我们倒反而有资格，那时我们真想再揍汤恩伯一顿，但终因暴力所压，只好敢怒而不敢言了！
    内战一打响，蒋介石马上就要我们去补充当炮灰，头一次骗走了我们一批，说到东北服务，不久消息传来，很多同志已做了内战的牺牲品，我们未走的听见了，心都凉啦！他妈的这是什么国家？不用我们就连饭也不要吃饱，用着了就替他们当炮灰！
    唉！中国幸亏出了个毛泽东，要不然我们不是“饿死”便是“战死”，所以同学们都很感谢毛主席，我们曾经勇敢的在南京国民政府的门口，贴了一条大标语：“此路不通，去找恩人毛泽东！”这是大家的心意，现在果然毛泽东把我们救出火坑，终于得到了解放。
