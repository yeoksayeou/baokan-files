Judging the Harvest by the Seasons, Overcoming Complacency:
Shexian Second District Intensifies Weeding and Continues to Conserve

[This newspaper's Shexian dispatch] After the recent thorough rain in the Second District, district and village cadres and the masses all felt that the famine was not a serious concern. For example, District Comrade [name omitted] led the masses to replant, and upon seeing the small seedlings growing well, also said, "The small seedlings are thriving, so there's nothing to fear." The villagers also said, "It has rained, let's eat some noodles." The masses said at mealtimes, "Don't worry, if we plant the seedlings and have rainwater, the harvest won't be too bad! Even if the harvest isn't great, the west has good harvests, we have good neighbors, so there's nothing to fear." This kind of thinking made the district and village cadres complacent, and they all said, "If we have rainwater, the harvest won't be too bad!" This serious complacency seriously hindered the enthusiasm for production and preparing for famine. After understanding this situation at the district cadre meeting on the 30th of last month, they first cleared the cadres' minds by judging the harvest by the seasons, breaking the complacency: planting was very late this year, and weeding is taking place during the second period of dog days (the season for planting vegetables). People often say, "After the Autumn Begins, hang up the hoe; on the sixth day of the sixth month, look at the millet and weeds; weeding the seedlings after the Autumn Begins, results in only a small scoop of grain per mu; planting late after Autumn Begins in the seventh month can still be harvested." This year, the Autumn Begins is in the sixth month, two days short of the second period of dog days, and because the rain is light, we cannot guarantee whether the harvest will be good or bad. Estimating the harvest from such a late season, everyone said: on average, dry land will yield two dou per mu, which would be considered good. There will be less bran from late millet, and no pumpkins, cowpeas, or yams. "Bran and vegetables for half a year's food" – it won't work without bran and vegetables. They also roughly calculated the harvest: the district has 10,398 mu of irrigated land, which, at a yield of seven dou per mu, can produce 7,280 shi. Dry land, which in a good year yields an average of six large dou per mu, can only yield two large dou this year. The 28,004 mu can produce 5,400 shi, for a total harvest of 12,680 shi, which is 11,400 shi less than last year. The harvest per person is reduced by five dou of coarse grain. This year's burden is estimated to be 500 shi of coarse grain, leaving a surplus of 12,180 shi. For the district's 22,000 people, this amounts to five dou of coarse grain per person. If we supplement to reach last year's living standard of one shi of coarse grain per person, there is a shortage of five dou per person, worth 15,000 yuan in silver dollars. This calculation doesn't even include the masses' miscellaneous expenses. After this calculation, everyone was shocked and felt they could no longer be complacent. They then discussed going to the villages to calculate the harvest for the masses, reminding the masses to: (1) resolutely implement production and famine preparedness for self-salvation, launch a mass movement against waste and for conservation, eliminate barren land, and plant all the land with vegetables; (2) because this year is a single crop, the time is very short, and if weeding is further delayed, the harvest will be even smaller. They proposed "Rather exhaust the labor force than delay the growth of the seedlings," mobilizing all full and partial laborers to launch a concentrated weeding campaign, universally weeding twice, and launching a merit-earning movement; (3) pay attention to the three major combinations, rectify cooperatives; lead sideline production, launch an individual initiative movement, and launch a second hundred-day spinning and weaving movement, accumulating hundred-day famine preparedness grain from savings and production.

### 看节令算年成打破麻痹　涉县二区加紧锄苗继续节约

　　看节令算年成打破麻痹
  　涉县二区加紧锄苗继续节约
    【本报涉县讯】二区这次透雨后，区村干部群众都感到灾荒不要紧了，如区干部×××同志领导群众补种上，一看小苗长的很好，也说：“小苗活旺旺的，可不怕了”，老乡也说：“下了雨啦，吃些面吧”，群众在饭场上说：“不怕了，按上苗，有雨水，收的还坏不了！就收不好，西边就是好年景，咱有好邻家，不怕。”这种思想把区村干部也都弄的麻痹了，都说：“这要有雨水，还收的很坏不了！”这种严重的麻痹思想，严重的阻碍了生产备荒的积极性。上月卅日区干部会上了解这种情况后，首先从看节令算年成上清醒干部的头脑，打破麻痹思想：今年种地很晚，锄苗是在二伏（种菜节令），人常说：“立了秋挂锄勾，六月六看谷莠，立秋锄小苗，一亩地一小瓢，七月立秋植晚都收，”今年是六月立秋，二伏短两天，因雨小收成好坏都不敢保证，从这样迟的节令，估计年成，大家说：旱地平均一亩收二斗就不坏了，晚谷糠少、南瓜、豆角、山药蛋都没有，“糠菜半年粮”，没糠菜就不行。又把年成大约算了一下，全区水地一万零三百九十八亩，按每亩七斗收，可收七千二百八十石，旱地按好年成每亩平均六大斗，今年只能收二大斗，二万八千零四亩，可收五千四百石，共收一万二千六百八十石，比去年少收一万一千四百石，每口人减收五斗粗粮，今年负担估计可出五百大石的粗粮，还余一万二千一百八十石，全区二万二千人口，每口合五斗粗粮，如果补到去年每人一石粗粮生活水平，一口短五斗，值洋一万五千元。这笔帐，还没把群众一切零开支计算到内，经过这样一算，大家都大吃一惊，感到再不敢麻痹了。随即研究到村去给群众算年成，提醒群众：（一）坚决贯彻生产备荒自救，开展群众性的反浪费节约运动，消灭白地熟荒，全部种上菜。（二）因今年是一茬苗，时间十分短，如果再误锄苗更要少收，提出“宁叫劳力死着慌，不叫小苗误了长”，把全半劳力动员起来，开展突击锄苗运动，普遍锄到两遍，开展立功运动。（三）注意三大结合，整顿合作社；领导副业生产，开展个找门路运动，开展第二个百日纺织运动，从节约生产里积余百日备荒粮。
