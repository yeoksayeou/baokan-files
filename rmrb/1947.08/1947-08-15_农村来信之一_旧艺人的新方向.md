	Rural Letters, Part 1
  　New Directions for Old Performers
    ...The literary and art symposium held by the Border Region Federation of Literary and Art Circles this time, according to Comrades Yaping and Heiding, was very fruitful. In particular, the conference attached great importance to the transformation of folk artists and the development of folk art. This was a great ideological awakening for us, and all comrades in our department express our heartfelt love and support. We believe that this is a true realization of the basic spirit of Chairman Mao's speech at the Yan'an Forum on Literature and Art, and a correct application of the New Democratic cultural policy. In the specific environment of the Ji-Lu-Yu large area, it meets the new hobbies and needs of the millions of liberated masses; in addition, it is also a new path for the numerous "craftsmen" and "storytellers" in this large area, a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity to transform their thinking and achieve liberation. This is a very memorable event in the cultural liberation movement.
    For tens of millions of years, we people have been poor performers looked down upon. But today, under the leadership of the Communist Party, our poor skills have been discovered and called an immeasurable potential force in culture. It is not only mass-based, but also national. If it is correctly grasped, it can exert great power. If its role is ignored and left to its own devices, it will become a huge rock and germ hindering the new cultural movement (because it is everywhere). Experience has repeatedly proven that transforming the thinking of old performers, inspiring their creative enthusiasm, and boldly promoting this work on a long-term and extensive basis should be an important part of the work of the Federation of Literary and Art Circles. In particular, the problem of transforming old performers in large and small cities after the great counter-offensive makes this work even more arduous. Your decision is very timely.
    Finally, your praise and encouragement for the work of our Folk Art Department makes us very excited, and we will definitely increase our work enthusiasm and confidence in the future. We hope you will provide more help and often send us learning materials.
    Respectfully, Zhang Fuchen, Director of the Ji-Lu-Yu Folk Art Department, and all comrades

    农村来信之一
  　旧艺人的新方向
    ……此次边区文联召开的文艺座谈会，据亚平、黑丁同志谈，收获甚巨，特别是对于改造民间艺人与开展民间艺术的问题，大会给了极大的重视，这对我们是个很大的思想觉醒，敝部全体同志特表示衷心热爱与拥护。我们认为这是真正的实现了毛主席在延安文艺座谈会上讲话的基本精神，是新民主主义文化政策的正确运用。在冀鲁豫大块地区的具体环境来说，正符合了千百万翻身群众的新的爱好与需要；另外也是这一大块地区众及“手艺人”“口艺人”的新生道路，是千载一时的改造思想与翻身的机会。这在文化翻身运动中，是大大可以纪念的一件事。
    几千万年来，我们这些人是被人看不起的穷艺人。可是今天在共产党的领导下，我们这些穷手艺，被发觉了，并称之为不可估计的文化上的潜在力量，它不仅是群众性的，也是全国性的。如果正确地掌握起来，可以发挥很大的力量，如果忽略它的作用，听其自然，它就会成为阻碍新文化运动一块巨石和毒菌（因为它无孔不入）。经验一再证明，改造旧艺人思想，启发艺人的创造热情，大胆长期广泛地推动这一工作，应该是文联工作的重要一环。特别是大反攻后大小城市的旧艺人改造问题，使这一工作更加繁重。你们的决定是很及时的。
    最后你们对我们民间艺术部的工作的表扬与鼓励，使我们很兴奋，今后一定更加提高工作的热情与信心。希望你们多帮助，常给我们寄学习材料来。
    冀鲁豫民间艺术部长　张富忱及全体同志谨启
