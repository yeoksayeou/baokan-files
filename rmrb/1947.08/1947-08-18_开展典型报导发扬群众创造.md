　　Develop Typical Reporting and Promote Mass Creativity
    Bīng Rú
    "Inspire the people's struggle, praise and commend the people's achievements and typical examples, and make it one of the party's methods of leadership" - Deputy Commander Teng pointed out at the anniversary of this newspaper that promoting typical examples is one of the main directions of news reporting in the people's newspaper. In the past year, we have made great achievements in typical reporting. Twenty typical news articles recommended by this newspaper won awards in this year's Border Region Cultural and Educational Awards.
    Since the founding of this newspaper, it has reflected the earth-shaking emancipation movement and the great achievements of the self-defense war in its news reports. Many correspondents directly participated in this rich struggle, thus reflecting the experience of the actual movement, promoting the typical creativity of the masses, and thus better guiding the actual movement.
    These typical news reports related to the actual lives of millions of people have been praised by readers from all sides. The excellent combat reports reflecting the patriotic self-defense war: Chairman Yang of the Border Region Government was deeply moved after reading "The Battle of Dayang Lake"; Comrade Li Wenbo's several wonderful battle descriptions such as "Blood on the Sleeve" were welcomed by a wide range of readers in the front and rear. In reflecting guerrilla warfare, many new experiences and mass creations have been provided. When the enemy launched an offensive towards the Northeast and Pinghan areas last autumn, the broad masses of soldiers and civilians rose up to protect their fields and defend themselves, and when divergent ideas occurred in some leaders, reporter Shi Hong and Comrade Tao Lujia, secretary of the Taihang Fifth Prefectural Committee, timely summarized and reported the experience of the party's unified leadership in adhering to decentralized guerrilla warfare. The Taiyue Branch provided "New Creations in the Counter-Settlement Movement in Yuanqu," proposing the direction of "holding a gun in one hand and distributing fields in the other" to adhere to guerrilla warfare. Comrade Li Fu's "From Panic to Fearlessness" (see this newspaper on April 23) vividly reflected the process of the people in the rear of the enemy in Lu Yu adhering to the war of protecting fields in the rear of the enemy, greatly encouraging the soldiers and civilians who persisted in fighting in the border areas and the rear of the enemy, and had great guiding significance for the actual struggle.
    Comrade Zhen of the Civil Affairs Department pointed out at a land reform risk investigation group meeting that promoting a good typical report has a greater effect than the mimeographed instructions and circulars issued by the leading organs. When the land reform turned from a large-scale mobilization to in-depth, thorough elimination of feudalism with even compensation, leaders at all levels found that cadres and the masses had a complacent "almost" mentality. Comrade Xiao Hang's news report "Land Reform in Nanweiquan" timely proposed overcoming the "almost" mentality and constantly sweeping and chasing landlords. At the same time, it used the method of rewarding self-reporting to dig "air-raid shelters" and squeeze out feudalism from within the peasants. This method was widely used by leaders in various places. The experience of adjusting the relationship between cadres and the masses in Zuoquan Chengguan, and Comrade Li Bingjie's typical creation of improving the relationship between cadres and the masses in Yetao introduced in "Establishing Models and Rendering Meritorious Service to Strengthen the Unity between Cadres and the Masses" changed the original steps of first raising opinions and then commending meritorious service, starting from commending meritorious service, increasing the unity between cadres and the masses, and opening up a new path for the whole region to adjust the relationship between cadres and the masses. This is a major gain in our news reporting. Because we have continuously reported the actual movement situation in various places, promoted the typical creation of the masses, and been able to exchange experiences and promote work, so that the newspaper is closely combined with the actual movement, but the People's Daily is the newspaper of 30 million people in the whole region, and no matter how much space is used, it cannot fully reflect the rich struggle situation in various places. Therefore, how to make the party newspaper better combine with reality, avoid the trivial and fragmentary news reports, use the typical reporting method, and promote the mass creation has become a topic that needs to be studied in the current news reporting.
    Typical reporting is the specific application of the leadership method of combining the general and the individual in news reporting. It is to find vivid facts from the movement, implement the party's guiding ideology, and use the experience and lessons of these typical examples to guide the work through the party newspaper. In this way, it is not to use force equally, record everything that is heard, and publish every manuscript, but to be good at grasping the typical examples that can represent the general from the general problems, excavating their successful experiences and lessons of failure, and making concentrated and prominent reports. The more the typical examples you excavate can represent the general, the more they can combine with reality, and the more mass creations you promote (in fact, there are everywhere), the more they can combine with the demands of the masses. The guiding task of the party newspaper lies in mastering and applying the typical reporting method, concentrating and promoting the creations of the masses, and turning them into guidelines for guiding the masses. This year, the newspaper successively published the experience of adjusting the relationship between cadres and the masses in Zuoquan Chengguan (see this newspaper on April 8) and the news of digging air-raid shelters in Nanweiquan, Licheng, which was quickly used by the masses in various places. For example, the Xingtai County Party Committee summarized the work in the evening and saw the newspaper early in the morning, and immediately added "digging air-raid shelters" as a new guiding principle. Comrade Xiao Xia's introduction to the successful leadership method of the Hebei-Shandong-Henan Seventh Prefectural Committee in "Carrying out the Movement of Establishing Meritorious Service and Commending Models" (see this newspaper on April 17) has been gradually used throughout the region after being affirmed and promoted by the newspaper, which shows that promoting typical examples has an important role in guiding the actual movement.
    Facts from various places prove that every guideline and call of the party is closely combined with the demands of the masses, and new creations and typical examples of the masses are abundant in practice. The task of our reporters and correspondents is to excavate new typical creations among the masses and commend the achievements of the masses' struggle. After the land reform and the large-scale production movement at the beginning of the year, as well as a year of self-defense war, various model figures and new typical examples have emerged and are growing in large numbers. Correspondents should be good at helping leaders promote these typical creations, such as Comrade Ran Hong and others going deep into the company to introduce the Wang Keqin Model Class; Comrade Gu Weijin going deep into the border area to report on "Du Balian"; Comrade Wang Ruzhen initially discovered Yang Juhe's armed work team and made continuous reports; all of which are worthy of praise. These typical model figures, after the leaders advocated and cultivated the in-depth investigation and reflection of the correspondents, quickly became the banner in the self-defense war. These kinds of typical figures may be in the initial stage of germination and not very complete (nor can they be very complete all at once), as long as they have guiding significance for a certain movement, they can be promoted. Yang Juhe's armed work team won seven battles and seven victories after the retreat in Jiaozuo, and Wang Keqin's method of leading new soldiers to fight and his method of dealing with the relationship between the military and civilians and the relationship between officers and soldiers did not have much significance if only viewed from the general combat significance and the contact between officers and soldiers in the relationship between the military and civilians. However, starting from the new reality of the reactionary field protection self-defense war, Wang Keqin, as a liberated soldier, can have such a good relationship between the military and civilians and the relationship between officers and soldiers, which shows the high class consciousness of the liberated soldiers in the reactionary field protection war. In this patriotic war of the people's consciousness, it shows the combination of courage and technology, which has universal significance for promoting the self-defense war and forming a movement.
    When reporting on typical examples, we should pay attention to promoting the creations of the masses, and should not isolate a few heroic figures and limit them to the activities of a few outstanding figures. Because typical examples have a general leading role, and the creations of the masses are unlimited. After Wang Keqin appeared in the self-defense war, new heroic models such as Jiao Wubao, Li Zhiwu, and Dong De emerged. After Du Balian, the second Du Balian appeared. Often a typical figure (such as Wang Keqin) or a typical place (such as Du Balian) can also develop into a mass movement. However, no matter whether it is the selection of typical events, regions, problems, or a typical movement, it is mostly manifested through certain figures. Therefore, typical reporting must conduct in-depth investigation and research, excavate the main key to carry out the movement, and show the main characteristics of solving certain problems or directions. According to the development and improvement of the movement, typical continuous reports should be made.

　　开展典型报导发扬群众创造
    冰如
    “鼓舞人民斗争，歌颂表扬人民的业迹和典型，成为党的领导方法之一”——滕副司令员在本报周年纪念时，指出发扬典型是人民报纸新闻报导的主要方向之一。一年来我们在典型报导方面已获得很大成绩。这次边区文教奖金评选时，由本报推荐二十篇典型新闻通讯已荣获奖金。
    从本报创刊以来，在新闻报导上反映了人民翻天覆地的翻身运动和自卫战争的伟大业迹。有许多通讯员同志，直接参加了这个丰富的斗争，从而反映了实际运动的经验，发扬了群众中的典型创造，因之也更好的指导了实际运动。
    这些关系到千百万人民实际生活的典型新闻报导，曾受到各方读者的赞扬，反映爱国自卫战争出色的战斗通讯：为“大杨湖之战”边府杨主席读后深为感动；李文波同志几篇精彩战斗描写如“袄袖上的血”等，曾受到前后方广大读者欢迎。在反映游击战争方面，曾提供了许多新的经验和群众创造。当去秋敌人向东北、平汉进攻时，广大军民纷起保田自卫，而某些领导思想发生了纷歧时，记者史洪与太行五地委书记陶鲁笳同志，及时总结报导了对坚持分散游击战争党的一元化领导的经验，太岳分社提供了“垣曲反倒算运动新的创造，提出“一手拿枪一手分田”坚持游击战争的方向。李夫同志的“由恐慌走向无畏”（见四月廿三日本报）生动的反映出鲁豫敌后人民，坚持敌后保田战争的过程，给坚持边地与敌后斗争的军民以很大的鼓舞，对实际斗争有很大指导意义。
    民运部的真同志，在一次土地改革险查团会议上，指出发扬一篇好的曲型报导，比领导机关发的油印指示、通报作用还大。当土改由大发动转向深入并平补齐彻底消灭封建时，各级领导都发现干部群众存在自满“差不多”思想，萧航同志“南委泉的土地改革”的通讯：及时的提出克服“差不多”思想不断的扫荡和追击地主，同时用奖励自报方法，挖“防空洞”，从农民内部挤清封建，这一方法普遍为各地领导同志所发扬运用。左权城关调整干群关系经验，李冰洁同志之“表模立功加强干群团结”的所介绍的冶陶改进干群关系的典型创造，改变了原来先提意见后表功的步骤，从表功着手，增进干群团结，给全区调整干群关系开辟了新的道路。这是我们新闻报导上重大收获。由于我们连续的报导了各地实际运动情况，发扬了群众的典型创造，能够交流经验推动工作，使报纸与实际运动密切结合，但人民日报是全布区三千万人民的报纸，无论用多大篇幅也不能全部反映各地丰富的斗争情况，因此如何使党报更好的结合实际，避免新闻报导的琐碎片面，运用典型报导方法，发扬群众创造，就成为当前新闻报导上须要研究的课题。
    典型报导，是一般与个别结合的领导方法在新闻报导上的具体运用。是从运动中找出活生生的事实，贯澈党的指导思想，通过党报用这些典型事例的经验教训去指导工作。这样作就不是平均使用力量，有闻必录，有稿必登，而是要善于从普遍性的问题中，抓住能够代表一般的典型。发掘其成功的经验和失败的教训，作到集中突出的报导。你所发掘典型愈能代表一般，便愈能结合实际，你发扬的群众创造愈多（事实上各地都有），便愈能结合群众的要求。党报的指导任务，就在于掌握运用典型报导方法，集中和发扬群众的创造，变成指导群众的方针。今年报纸连续发表了左权城关调整干群关系的经验（见四月八日本报）和黎城南委泉挖防空洞的消息，很快为各地群众所运用。如邢台县委在晚间总结工作，早起见到报纸，立即把“挖防空洞”补充作为新的指导方针。肖峡同志关于冀鲁豫七地委“开展立功表模运动成功领导方法的介绍（见四月十七日本报），经过报纸肯定提倡，现已在全区逐渐运用起来，这说明了发扬典型对实际运动指导具有重要作用。
    从各地事实证明，党的每一方针号召是密切结合群众要求的，在实践中群众新的创造和典型是大量存在的。我们记者和通讯员的任务，就在于发掘群众中新的典型创造表扬群众斗争的业迹。经过土地改革和年初的大生产运动，以及一年自卫战争，各种模范人物和新的典型，是已经涌现出来和正在大量生长起来。通讯员同志要善于帮助领导发扬这些典型的创造，如冉虹等同志深入连队，介绍王克勤模范班；古维进同志深入边地报导“杜八联”；王汝珍同志最初发现杨聚和武工队作了连续报导；都是值得表扬的。这些典型模范人物，经过领导上提倡培养通讯员的深入调查反映，很快就成为自卫战争中的旗帜。这类典型人物在最初也许只是萌芽的不很完整的（也不能一下子即很完整）只要他对某一运动具有指导意义，都是可以发扬的。杨聚和武工队在焦作撤退后七战七捷，王克勤在军民关系上和带领新战士作战方法上如只从一般战斗意义上和军民关系官兵联系上说，并无多大意义，但我们从反动保田自卫战争新的现实出发，王克勤以一个解放战士，能有这样好的军民关系和官兵关系，便显示出反动保田战争中解放战士高度的阶级自觉，在这个人民自觉的爱国战争中表现出勇敢与技术结合的创造，对于推动自卫战争便具有普遍意义，形成了运动。
    我们在报导典型时，要注意发扬群众的创造，不应把少数英雄人物孤立起来，只限于少数突出人物的活动。因为典型具有一般的带头作用，而群众的创造是无限的，自卫战争中，出现王克勤之后又涌现出焦五保，李治武，董德等新的英雄模范，杜八联之后又出现了第二杜八联，往往一个典型的人物（如王克勤）或一个典型的地方（如杜八联）也可以发展成群众运动，但不管选择典型的事件也好，地区也好，问题也好，一个典型的运动，多半是通过一定的人物表现出来的，因之典型报导必须深入调查研究，发掘开展运动的主要关键，表现解决一定问题或方向的主要特点。根据运动的发展提高，作到典型的连续报导。
