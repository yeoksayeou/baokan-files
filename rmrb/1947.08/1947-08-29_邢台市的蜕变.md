　　Xingtai City is undergoing a transformation. The colorful and luxurious goods of the enemy are being concentrated from the shelves of major stores to foreign goods specialty stores; native products such as cloth, towels, and soap are replacing them as daily necessities. Farmers from the surrounding villages are streaming in front of the stores, becoming the most important customers. Slogans on the walls, such as "Develop local products, serve the masses" and "Oppose Chiang and American enemy goods," demonstrate the essence and future of this transformation. According to the city government statistics, foreign merchant capital accounted for 52% of the city's total capital in March of last year, but it has now decreased to 18.7%. The changes in North Street most powerfully illustrate this trend. This street was known as "Foreign Goods Street." In March of last year, there were 82 businesses dealing in foreign cloth, dyes, Guangdong goods, and funeral supplies, with their capital accounting for 86% of the street's total. Now, only 28 businesses continue to deal in essential foreign goods. The number of local goods merchants has increased from 9 to 71, and their capital has increased from 2.9% to 53% of the street's total. According to relevant sources, this gratifying change is entirely the result of the New Merchant Movement. The New Merchant Movement has two main components: serving the masses and the countryside, and small profits with large sales. It is said that getting merchants to do these two things is practically a major revolution. Initially, there was strong ideological resistance to mobilizing foreign goods merchants to switch trades, as they believed that everyone dealing in local goods would make no money. They asserted that making money meant not selling local goods, and selling local goods meant not making money. At this time, the leadership adopted a policy of enlightening merchants to become conscious, guiding everyone to discuss: who benefits from selling foreign goods? Even if they made a small profit, the big money was earned by the imperialists, and they were unknowingly helping the enemy. At the same time, they focused on the merchants' basic requirement of making money, explaining that after land reform, the purchasing power of farmers had increased unprecedentedly, and the playboys who spent lavishly on foreign luxuries were no longer viable. To make money, they had to do business with the farmers. They also combined this with current affairs education, pointing out that the Liberated Areas were gradually expanding, the Chiang-occupied areas were shrinking, the source of foreign goods was getting smaller and smaller, and the local goods market was getting bigger and bigger. Continuing to deal in foreign goods would only lead to increasing trouble. Merchants have practical and flexible vision. After repeated discussions, many began to understand and planned to switch trades, but they raised another difficult issue: "Every trade is like a mountain, and we don't know how to switch." The leadership immediately mobilized the merchants to discuss and encouraged everyone to find solutions. Merchants on the major streets said very clearly after discussions: "Our eyes should be on the farmers. We should sell whatever they need, and we'll definitely get rich." "If capital doesn't circulate and we don't know how to operate in a different trade, we can help each other." With determination and solutions, some people began to try. The East Street Shop Employee Union, seeing that there was a drought this year and farmers needed to grow more autumn vegetables, immediately went to Zhengding to sell vegetable seeds, making a net profit of 2.5 million in one month. Zhang Jinrong, together with some small and medium-sized stores, raised capital to trade in local cloth, making a net profit of 200,000 in eight days. Hengli Dong, who dealt in foreign goods, was unwilling to switch trades and was sitting idly by, wasting 3 million in half a year. The leadership seized these typical examples, using comparative publicity to establish banners, and many stores followed suit, creating a trend. It is said that switching trades generally involves a gradual shift of focus through capital and labor cooperation. Five foreign goods merchants in South Gate jointly invested 7 million to organize a "Five Blessings Local Cloth Store." Each family sent one person to work in the store, and profits were distributed according to shares. The original store continued to sell foreign goods, and the money earned was invested in the local cloth store, so that the focus of operations could be slowly shifted. Some are developing in the direction of handicrafts. Four or five foreign goods merchants in South Gate invested 2.2 million to organize a shoe sole factory, which is producing very well, earning 10,000 per day. Another more common method is to jointly run businesses, operating in non-fixed businesses according to the needs of the farmers. After switching trades, because everyone wanted to deal in local goods, some stores with open minds first responded to the government's call and began to adopt a business model of small profits and large sales. The East Street Shop Employee Union used to look for two-tenths of a profit, making 100,000 in business every day, earning 20,000. Now, they look for one-tenth of a profit, increasing to 400,000 in business every day, earning 40,000. The business method of "taking more profits, returning as soon as you see profit" has achieved factual victory. The erroneous method of "not opening for three years, but eating for three years" has been slowly abandoned by merchants. Most of the foreign goods merchants have switched trades, and only a few foreign goods are left on the market. Xingtai City has adopted control and monopoly measures to eradicate them within a time limit and transfer this capital to local goods operations. Eight specialty stores have been set up to register all foreign goods and centrally sell them in the specialty stores, with the selling price still belonging to the original owners. The specialty sales are the responsibility of the merchants themselves, and the price is jointly determined by the municipal authorities and the merchants to prevent hoarding and raising prices, or suppressing prices too low and transferring them to the black market, causing excessive losses to the merchants. It is expected that they will be sold out soon, and Xingtai will become a purely local goods market. According to the reporter, the New Merchant Movement has made the Xingtai market increasingly prosperous. With the democratic government's help in switching trades and the provision of large loans (nearly 400 million), the number of stationary merchants has increased from 1,334 last year to 2,229 now; the number of peddlers has increased from 830 to 1,797. Although Xingtai City and its villages vigorously advocate thrift, it is estimated that the trade volume has still increased by about one-third compared to the past.

　　邢台市的蜕变
    【本报记者二十六日电】邢台市场在蜕变中。五颜六色的仇货奢侈品，从各主要商店的货架上集中到外货专卖处；土产的布匹毛巾肥皂等日用必需品，代替了它们。四乡农民在商店门前川流不息，成为当前最主要的顾客，墙壁上“发展土货，为群众服务”“反对蒋美仇货”的标语，显示了这种蜕变的实质和前途。据市政府统计，去年三月外货商资金将占全市资金百分之五十二，目前则已降至百分之十八点七。北大街的变化，能够最有力的说明这种趋势，该街称“外货街”，去年三月，洋布、颜色、广货、寿衣四行，共有八十二户，资金占全街总额百分之八十六，现在只有二十八户，继续经营外货必需品。土货商由九户发展到七十一户，资金由占全街总额百分之二点九，增至百分之五十三，据有关方面说，这种可喜的变化，完全是发展新商人运动的结果。新商人运动的内容有二：一是为群众为农村服务，一是薄利广销。据称，使商人作到这两点，简直是一个大革命，最初动员外货商人转业，曾遭遇顽强的思想抵抗，认为大家都办土货，怎么能赚钱，他们于是肯定的说，要赚钱就不能卖土货，卖土货就不能赚钱。这时，领导上采取了启发商人自觉的方针，引导大家讨论：贩卖外货是帮助了谁？自己纵然赚了几个小钱，大钱却让帝国主义赚去了，自己不知不觉的就帮助了敌人。同时又抓住商人赚钱的基本要求，再说明土地改革后，农民的购买力空前提高，销用外货奢侈品的公子哥儿，已经吃不开了，要想赚钱，就必须作农民的买卖。又结合时事教育，指出解放区逐步扩大，蒋占区日益缩小，外货来源，一天比一天小，土货市场，一天比一天大，继续经营外货，必致越来越糟。商人的眼光实际而又灵活，许多人经过反复讨论，开始想通，计划转业，但又提出另一个难题：“隔行如隔山，想转业又不会转。”领导上立即发动商人自己讨论，提倡大家想办法，各大街的商人讨论后，都很明确的说：“咱们的眼要看着农民，他们用什么，咱们办什么，保险发财。”“资本周转不开，不会隔行经营，大家可以互助起来。”有了决心及办法，一部分人就开始尝试。东大街店员联合社，看着今年天旱，农民要多种秋菜，立刻去正定贩菜籽，一个月净赚二百五十万。张金荣联合一些中小商店，集资行商贩土布，八天净赚二十万。经营外货的恒力东，不愿转业，坐着死吃，半年白白耗费三百万，领导上抓紧这些典型例子，对比宣传，树立旗帜，许多商店都跟着转业，造成一种风气。据称：转业一般采取资金劳力合作，逐渐转移重点的方式，南关五个外货商，共同集股七百万元，组织一“五福土布店”，每家各派一人在店里工作，了钱按股分红，原店继续出售外货，卖了钱即投入土布店，如此经营重点即可慢慢转移过来。有的则向手工业方向发展。南关四、五个外货商，集资二百廿万，组织一鞋底工厂，生产很好，每天可赚一万元。另有一种较普遍的方式，是联合跑行商，按照农民的需要，经营不固定的业务。转业后，因为大家都要经营土货，部分思想开通的商店，首先响应政府号召，开始采用薄利广销的经营方式。东大街店员联合社，过去看二分利，每天作十万元的生意，可赚两万元。现在看一分利，每天增加到四十万元的生意，可赚四万元。“多多取利，见利就回”的经营方法，获得事实的胜利。“三年不开张，开张吃三张”的错误方式，遂被商人慢慢抛弃了。外货商人大部转业，外货在市场上剩了少数，邢市即采取了管制专卖办法，以便限期根绝，把这些资本转移到土货经营。设立八个专卖处，登记所有外货，集中专卖处统一销售，售价仍归原主，专卖由这些商号自己推人负责，价格由市政当局与商人共同规定，以防奇货可居，抬高市价，或抑价太低，转入黑市，商人过分吃亏。预计不久即可售完，邢台即将成一纯粹土货市场。据记者获悉，新商人运动，使邢台市场，日益繁荣，经民主政府多方帮助转业，及以大量贷款（数近四万万元）扶植，结果坐商已自去年一千三百三十四家，至现在二千二百二十九家；行商贩由八百三十家，增至一千七百九十七家。邢市及乡村，虽大力提倡节约，估计贸易额，仍较过去增加约三分之一。
