Xinhua News Agency, Jin-Cha-Ji, 17th. The people's liberation army's local armed forces in the Guannei section of the Beining Railway are rapidly growing stronger. They have developed from dozens of people with a few broken sleeve guns into a strong force with ×× people and guns, and from scattered guerrilla warfare in the past to today's concentrated mobile warfare. The soldiers are fond of sayings such as "cast a big net to catch big fish" and "take a long knife to cut big chunks of meat." Their initial trial of strength was in mid-May when they briefly occupied Changli and later Houfengtai and Liushouying; their second major action was forcing back the enemy from Funing and Qian'an, and removing the strongholds along the Yuguan, Shenhe, and Shimenzhai lines, as well as the outer defenses of Qinhuangdao and Shanhaiguan.

Last September, Chiang and the US launched a major offensive against central Hebei. After occupying various cities, they used heavy troops to control the Beining line and equipped some of the puppet Manchukuo troops to help defend it. Local people were forced to arm themselves for self-defense. For example, the Ninghe guerrilla unit in the Tanggu and Lutai area had only a dozen cadres and one broken gun when it was established last summer. In just a few months, it grew into a force of ×× people and guns. They used crooked-neck machine guns and homemade grenades to drive the invading American-equipped Chiang Kai-shek's 49th Army into a panicked retreat. They seized American equipment to arm themselves. Last autumn, the Luan County guerrillas captured a rocket launcher. At first, the soldiers regarded the barrel as a small chimney and the shells as iron pestles. Later, they realized it was a good weapon and asked captured Chiang Kai-shek officers to teach them how to use it. This rocket launcher participated in the battle in eastern Luan in May of this year. In continuous battles, the various units gradually acquired excellent equipment. The Ninghe guerrilla unit underwent a complete transformation in its equipment during eight months of self-defense warfare. The automatic weapons it possessed were comparable to those of a main force regiment. Most of the rifles were replaced with Type 38, Zhongzheng, and American-made rifles. Each platoon was equipped with American-made automatic rifles, and all ammunition was American-made. In addition, each person had a steel helmet.

The enemy and puppets on the Beining Railway attempted to occupy all the towns and lines in eastern Hebei in order to compress and eliminate our army, but the local troops who persisted in the struggle thoroughly shattered this attempt by using "the enemy advances, we advance" and "active initiative" counterattacks. For example, after the Anping Incident and the Xianghe Defense War last summer, most of the Tong County, Xianghe, and Wuqing areas were occupied by the enemy, followed by Sanhe and Baodi. However, our local troops did not retreat, but instead actively attacked the Beining line. After attacking Tong County and Wuqing this spring, the vast area west of the Grand Canal, including Anping Town, was recovered by us. The Meichang stronghold outside Yangcun Station was occupied three times by Chiang Kai-shek's troops and puppets, and was captured three times by us. After that, the enemy retreated to defend the railway and dared not venture far from the strongholds. The Chiang Kai-shek and puppet troops in Ninghe set up more than a dozen strongholds, which were all forced back or eliminated by us. The military transport of the Chiang Kai-shek army on the Beining Railway was frequently cut off by the People's Liberation Army. By the end of June this year, eastern Hebei had successively recovered nine cities: Zunhua, Suxian, Pinggu, Funing, Qian'an, Ninghe, Baodi, Qinglong, and Xinglong. If calculated based on the position at the time of the ceasefire order, only five cities—Yutian, Xianghe, Lulong, and Leting—remained in the hands of the enemy.

### 冀东地方武装发展壮大　装备优良能打运动战

　　冀东地方武装发展壮大
  　装备优良能打运动战
    【新华社晋察冀十七日电】北宁路关内一段的人民解放军地方武装迅速成长壮大。他们从几十个人几条破旧的套筒枪，发展成拥有××人枪的精壮队伍，从过去分散游击而发展到今天的集结打运动战。战士中流行着撒大网捉大鱼，拿长把刀，切大块肉的谚语。五月中旬一度攻占昌黎及后封台、留守营等地，是他们的锋刃初试，紧接着迫退抚宁、迁安之敌；拔除了榆关、深河、石门寨一线及秦皇岛、山海关外围据点，则是他们的第二炮。
    去年九月，蒋美联合大举进攻冀中，占领各城市以后，即用重兵控制北宁线，并且装备了一些伪满军帮助防守。当地人民被迫武装自卫。例如塘沽、芦台一带的宁河某游击队，去夏成立时只十余干部和一条破枪，不几月就发展成××人枪的队伍。他们曾用歪把子机枪和土造手榴弹打得进犯的美械蒋军四十九军狼狈逃窜。他们曾缴获了美式装备武装自己。去秋滦县游击队缴获了火箭炮，起初战士把炮筒看成小烟囱，炮弹看成铁棒棰，以后才知道是好武器，请被俘蒋军官做教师，很快学会使用，今年五月滦东战役中，这门火箭炮就参加了战斗。在连续的战斗中，各部队都逐渐获取了优良装备。宁河游击队在八个月的自卫战争中装备焕然一新，其中自动火器已可同主力团装备相比。步枪大部换为三八式中正式和美造，各排均配有美造自动步枪，所有弹药则全部为美造，此外每人并有钢盔一顶。
    北宁路敌伪企图占领整个冀东城镇点线，压缩消灭我军，但是当地坚持斗争的部队却用“敌进我进”、“积极主动”的反击彻底粉碎了它。如去夏安平事件与香河保卫战后，通县、香河、武清大部地区都被敌侵占，跟着三河、宝坻亦被侵占，但当地我军并未后退，反而更积极向北宁线出击。今春攻入通县、武清之后，安平镇等运河以西广大地区继又被我收复。杨村车站外围据点梅厂蒋伪侵占三次，被我攻克三次，以后敌人即退守铁路，不敢再远出安据点。宁河蒋伪安下据点十多处，被我全部逼退或打掉，北宁路蒋军军运则经常遭解放军切断。到今年六月底，冀东曾先后收复遵化、苏县、平谷、抚宁、迁安、宁河、宝坻、青龙、兴隆九城，如以停战令时位置计算，仅有玉田、香河、卢龙、乐亭五城尚在敌手中。
