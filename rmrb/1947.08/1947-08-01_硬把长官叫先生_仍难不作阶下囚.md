Xinhua News Agency, Frontline of Hebei- Shandong-Henan, 29th - Jiang Jieshi and his various levels of generals have felt extremely distressed and fearful due to the continuous capture of high-ranking commanders. This has now been further confirmed in the secret countermeasures captured by General Liu Bocheng's troops during the great victory in Junan. This document was personally formulated by Chen Yiding and Luo Zhedong, the commander and deputy commander of the 70th Division, based on Jiang’s instructions after recently receiving training in Nanjing. The measures are as follows: (1) Superiors address subordinates by their names, and subordinates address superiors as "Mister." Equals address each other by names or as Old Zhang and Old Li. (2) All superiors wear soldier uniforms, without any insignia. Rank insignia and shoulder insignia are sewn inside the pockets. The guards and messengers accompanying all levels of superiors should avoid any respectful gestures. When carrying handguns, they should be concealed in their pockets. (3) Under no circumstances should the headquarters choose good houses. If there are residents, they should be asked to leave and concentrated in one room. Multiple fake headquarters should be set up, with only one guard on duty at the gate, using rifles... (4) When marching, if encountered by civilians asking questions, answer "Eighth Route Army." If asked by friendly troops, answer "Fighting the Eighth Route Army." Under no circumstances should the unit number be revealed. (5) When entering public places, such as taverns, bathhouses, and shops, military matters must not be discussed... Strictly prohibit idle chats with civilians. These "Misters" Chen Yiding and Luo Zhedong, the commander and deputy commander of the 70th Division who personally formulated these secret measures, wore soldier uniforms, had no insignia, and had rank insignia and shoulder insignia sewn inside their pockets, as well as thousands upon thousands of "Old Zhangs" and "Old Lis," were all captured by the People's Liberation Army.
