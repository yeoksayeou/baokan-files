    Pengcheng workers in Cixian County are actively growing vegetables to overcome the famine. Cadre Xu Shouyin is taking the lead. In addition to working every day, he and Li Qinglin and three others have organized a mutual aid group, carrying water to plant. They have now planted two mu of vegetables and corn. They have also mobilized all the workers in the factory to collect wild vegetables. After eating some every day, they have more than 30 jin left over. Under the influence of the group he leads, Chen Qingrong works at the kiln during the day and goes back to water the garden at night. Xie Wenxiu works two shifts a day and farms in the afternoon. He had already harrowed more than ten mu of dry land, and it rained the day before yesterday, so he quickly planted. All the workers in the branch are opening up barren kiln yards, and have now opened three and a half mu and planted vegetables. Workers at the Dongxiaolou lower kiln have established specific savings plans. Everyone should save 200 yuan a day. Xu Shougui doesn't buy flour to eat but buys wheat to grind himself and doesn't throw away the bran. The bran earned by his little donkey grinding flour for others is all eaten by him. The entire branch estimates that production has increased by 2% and living expenses have decreased by 2/10ths. A total of 11 mu have been planted, and 3.5 mu of wasteland have been opened up. This movement is continuing to develop. (Cixian County Production Communications)
