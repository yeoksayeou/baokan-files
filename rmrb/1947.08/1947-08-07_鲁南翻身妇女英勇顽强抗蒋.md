Xinhua News Agency, Shandong, 5th. The liberated women of Southern Shandong, under the slogan "To live, one must fight!", have launched a tenacious and unyielding struggle against Chiang. Wang Da Niang, who participated in the Teng County armed work team, when the enemy was "suppressing" the Lushan Mountain area, single-handedly went deep into the enemy area to serve as a reconnaissance liaison. On the way, she encountered the enemy and was seriously injured. She immediately endured the pain and tore up the documents, swallowing them. When the enemy interrogated her, she did not utter a word and died heroically. When a Chiang soldier attempted to rape a twelve-year-old girl in a village in Luxi (Xin County is east of Teng County), the women of the village united and stoned the Chiang soldier to death. They then went up the mountain to join the guerrillas. Women in another village lived together collectively. Once, when Chiang soldiers wanted to take a woman from the village away, all the women of the village swarmed up and drove the Chiang soldiers away. Jiang Da Niang, the women's group leader of the 7th district of Zhao (Xin County is north of Pi County), was kidnapped by Chiang soldiers. They hung her up by her limbs and placed a stone weighing more than 20 kilograms on her waist, forcing her to hand over the guns and ammunition of her militiaman husband. She resolutely refused to the end, and finally preserved the weapons of self-defense. Now, many village women have formed guerrilla groups, attacking small groups of enemies everywhere.

    鲁南翻身妇女
    英勇顽强抗蒋
    【新华社山东五日电】鲁南翻身妇女在“要活命只有拚”的口号下，掀起了顽强不屈的反蒋斗争。参加滕县武工队的王大娘，当敌人“清剿”麓水山区时，她单身深入敌区担任侦察联络工作，中途与敌人遭遇，身受重伤，她立即忍痛将文件撕碎咽下，待敌逼问她时，她只字未吐，壮烈牺牲。麓水（新县在滕县东）县某村妇女当一蒋军欲奸污其十二岁幼女时，即联合十余妇女将该蒋军用石头砸死。自己上山参加游击队。另村妇女集体住宿，一次蒋军要将该村一妇女拉走，全村妇女即蜂拥而上，将蒋军赶跑。赵某（新县在邳县北）七区妇女组长姜大娘被蒋军绑去，将她四肢吊起，腰间放上二十多斤重的石头，逼迫缴出其民兵丈夫的枪、弹，她坚决拒绝到底，终于保存了自卫的武器，现已有不少村庄妇女成立了游击小组，到处袭击小股敌人。
