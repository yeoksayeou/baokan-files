Xinhua News Agency, Jinji Luyu, 19th - Doctors of both Chinese and Western medicine in the Taihang area are traveling to the front lines and rear areas to serve the masses. Twenty-odd doctors from counties such as Zuoquan and Yushe, carrying large quantities of medicine, have gone to various border counties to carry out treatment work. Du Jinzhong and Xu Heju, seventeen Chinese and Western medicine practitioners from Huguan, went to the front along with militia stretcher teams during the Yubei Campaign. After serving with the army for seventy days, both were selected as models when summarizing their participation. Twenty-five doctors in the first district of the county treated and cured more than 900 people in one month. They proposed: (1) Respond immediately to requests; go immediately upon hearing of illness. (2) See more people, provide good treatment, and spend less money. (3) Maintain personal hygiene and help the masses maintain hygiene. (4) If one person can't figure it out, everyone will research it together; treat the illness well and don't be careless. Doctors in Gucun organized a medical team and treated 115 people and cured 46 livestock during the village temple fair. The masses are considering reporting their meritorious service. The Lu'an Hospital in Changzhi City organized doctors from the city into three groups to automatically go to each street for door-to-door diagnosis and treatment, curing 19 patients with dysentery in one day. Wang Qianyi, a doctor from the Fourth Administrative Office, used Glauber's salt to make sulfur bitters, which proved very effective.

　　太行中西医生广为群众治病
    【新华社晋冀鲁豫十九日电】太行区各地民间医生奔走前线后方，为群众服务，左权、榆社等县二十余医生，并携带大批药品分赴各边沿县进行治疗工作。壶关中西医杜尽忠、徐和聚等十七人，在豫北战役中随民兵担架队奔赴前方。随军七十天，总结参战工作时，两人均当选模范。该县一区二十五个医生，一个月医愈九百余人，他们提出：（一）见请就到，闻病就到。（二）看的要多，治的要好，花钱要少。（三）自己讲卫生，帮助群众讲卫生。（四）一人看不透，众人来研究，看好病，不马虎。固村医生组织医疗队，于该村庙会期间，给群众一百一十五人看好了病，治好牲口四十六头。群众酝酿给他们报功。长治市潞安医院组织全市医生，分成三组自动去各街挨户诊疗，一天内治好患痢疾者十九人。四专署医生王谦义以皮硝制硫苦，效力很大。
