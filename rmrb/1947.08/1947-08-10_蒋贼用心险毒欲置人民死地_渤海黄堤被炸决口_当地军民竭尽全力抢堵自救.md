Xinhua News Agency, Shandong, 7th: As the water level of the Yellow River rises sharply, the Yellow River dikes in the Bohai region, including counties such as Lijin, Putai, Binhai, Kenli, Gaoyuan, and Huimin, have been brutally bombed day and night by Chiang Kai-shek's aircraft since the 11th of last month. Dangerous sections of the dikes have been breached and collapsed, causing water to flow out, and the situation is extremely precarious. With the threat of enemy aircraft, the masses are unable to carry out repairs, and the situation is worsening. At Xiaoshen Temple in Kenli, a breach of 5 to 7 meters occurred at 3 PM on the 1st, which soon expanded to more than 20 meters. More than 2,000 local people desperately tried to block the breach; by the evening of the 2nd, more than 10 meters had been blocked, but the breach had not yet been closed. The Wangjiazhuang dangerous section in Lijin was subjected to continuous bombing and strafing by Chiang's aircraft for an hour on the 2nd. As the floodwaters surged, the river dikes were riddled with holes, and four people were injured while the masses risked their lives to carry out rescue efforts. More than 15,000 catties of straw material for reinforcement were hit by incendiary bombs and completely burned. The 21-li dike and enclosure dam from Caojiadian to Dayuzhang section in Putai was bombed, causing water to leak in many places. Local government personnel led the masses to rescue the situation, throwing in more than 50,000 catties of straw material within four hours to stabilize the situation; however, the Daoxu section was repeatedly bombed by multiple Chiang-American silver bombers on the 3rd and 4th, and a boat carrying straw material was hit and sank, with the straw material completely submerged in the turbid waters of the Yellow River. In addition, the dry grass nest in Kenli, Xiaojiezi and Damazhuang in Lijin, Zhang You堂 in Binhai, and Liu Chunjia in Gaoyuan are all facing emergencies due to the bombing, and the military and civilians in the Bohai Sea region are doing their utmost to carry out rescue efforts. Chiang Kai-shek and the United Nations Relief and Rehabilitation Administration colluded to arbitrarily block the Huayuankou breach, failing to provide materials for dike restoration, and hindering dike restoration in various ways. His intention must be to drown millions of people in our downstream areas. The people of our Bohai region, overcoming various difficulties, have destroyed their homes and donated to the disaster relief efforts. By the end of last month, they had completed 201,043,296 cubic feet of earthwork, transported 39,328,246 cubic feet of bricks and stones, 4,344,337 catties of straw material, mobilized 200,000 people, and completed most of the rescue and repair tasks. However, Chiang Kai-shek was jealous of the people's rescue and has been continuously bombing wildly for nearly a month since last month, causing disastrous damage to the achievements of the people's struggle in the entire region, and the lives of millions are in imminent danger. Chiang Kai-shek's towering crime of exterminating humanity will never be forgotten, and the people will eventually settle this blood debt.
