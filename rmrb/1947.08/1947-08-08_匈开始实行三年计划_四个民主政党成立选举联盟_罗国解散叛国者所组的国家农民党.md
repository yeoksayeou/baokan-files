Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, August 2nd Telegram: Budapest dispatch: Hungary is scheduled to begin implementing its Three-Year Plan on August 1st. This marks the first time in the country's history that planned production has been implemented. The Trade Union Federation has launched a nationwide celebration of this "beginning of creative construction work" and called on all working people to "strive for the successful completion of the Three-Year Plan." Prior to the implementation of the Three-Year Plan, Hungary's reconstruction work proceeded smoothly. As a result of increased agricultural production, the Supreme Economic Council has ordered that the bread ration be increased from 150 centimeters (approximately three and a half centimeters equals one inch) to 250 centimeters from August 1st. Coal production in June has far exceeded the average daily output of 1938, the highest pre-war production year.

Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, August 5th Telegram: Budapest dispatch: Hungary's parliamentary elections will be held on the 31st of this month, and the election campaign has begun nationwide. The four democratic parties participating in the government: the Communist Party, the Social Democratic Party, the Smallholders' Party, and the National Democratic Party, decided to form the "Hungarian National Independence Front Election Alliance" at a party meeting held on July 29th. On August 1st, they issued an election manifesto, proposing the alliance's political program: to defend Hungary's sovereignty and independence, oppose foreign interference in internal affairs, eliminate reactionaries, defend democracy, the fruits of victory in land reform and the nationalization of major banks, actively implement the Three-Year Plan, and call for "preventing the enemy of the people from sowing discord among the democratic parties." So far, nine political parties have registered to participate in the election. In addition to the above four parties, the other five parties are: the National Peasant Radical Party, the Civilian Democratic Party, the People's Democratic Party, the Hungarian Independent Democratic Party, and the Hungarian Independence Party. The Hungarian Independence Party was newly established a few days ago, led by Feffer, the right-wing leader of the former Smallholders' Party who was expelled, and is actively engaged in activities against the democratic parties.

Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, August 4th Telegram: Bucharest dispatch: At the request of the Democratic Parties Alliance and trade unions across Romania, the Romanian government decided on July 29th to dissolve the National Peasants' Party, headed by the traitor Maniu. After the promulgation of this resolution, it was supported by the people of the whole country. The government, parliament, Ministry of Interior, and newspaper editorial offices received thousands of telegrams and resolutions, unanimously praising the government's resolute measures. In telegrams from workers in places like Grivica, they demanded that "the government more firmly cleanse all fascist and reactionary scum."
