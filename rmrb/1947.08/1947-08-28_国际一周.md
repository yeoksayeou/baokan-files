　　International Week

　　Another week has passed, and Europe and the Far East remain the two major centers of the international situation. This week, reflecting the collusion and conflict between the three countries of Britain, the United States, and France, in addition to the Anglo-American Ruhr issue conference, there were two other conferences. These were the Anglo-American negotiations on amending loan conditions (held in Washington on the 18th) and the US-British-French conference on the industrial level of West Germany (convened in London on the 22nd). The Ruhr issue conference has been proceeding slowly in an "inauspicious" atmosphere for a week. The negotiations on amending loan conditions only took four days. In a situation where both the United States and Britain "felt pessimistic about the future," except for the United States agreeing to Britain temporarily suspending its obligation to freely convert pounds sterling, they hastily announced that "its main stage has come to an end." The illusion that Britain had originally hoped that the masters of Wall Street would be "merciful" and loosen the chains around its neck before the meeting has burst like a soap bubble. According to the Associated Press, what it got from the United States was "the determination to strictly adhere to the loan agreement." Britain had originally hoped to obtain new "emergency loan assistance" from the United States in this negotiation as a "life-saving medicine" for its extremely bad economic situation, but what it got was the United States' "death warrant." The United States arrogantly proposed that in order to obtain US loans, Britain must clearly tell the US government its future policies" and stop further plans for the nationalization of steel, etc."; and put forward "many requirements involving influencing British domestic affairs." This reckless act of the United States taking advantage of Britain's plight to use money to interfere in its internal affairs has made London "bankers and the business community panic," and even the mouthpiece of the British bourgeoisie, the London News Chronicle, has to cry out: "Cannot succumb to American pressure." As for the German industrial level conference, it also reflects the infighting between Britain, the United States, and France, but here, Britain's position is strengthened because France is participating in bargaining with the United States. The Soviet Union has formally protested against this conference, pointing out that this move is an illegal act of abandoning the Potsdam Agreement.

　　While fear and disappointment with the "Marshall Plan for European Aid" are growing, the economic relations between several European capitalist countries such as the Netherlands, Switzerland, and Sweden and the new democratic countries of Southeastern Europe have recently become active. In a short period of time, nine loan, economic, or trade agreements have been signed one after another. Even Britain, after signing a three-year barter agreement with Hungary, is actively conducting commercial negotiations with Yugoslavia. This is a major new international event, illustrating the stability and prosperity of the economies of the new democratic countries, which has made some capitalist countries in Europe begin to understand that only these countries can truly help their broken economies and are the most reliable, promising, and guaranteed customers for them to trade with. This is also one of the basic trends of the inevitable development of the future international situation.

　　The Indo-Dutch war continues to develop. The facts of the past week have further confirmed that the so-called ceasefire order issued by the Netherlands, with the support of the United States and others, is merely a trick to buy time to arrange a larger-scale offensive. This is no different from the "ceasefire order" directed by Marshall in China. Since the "ceasefire order" was issued, the Netherlands has broken the agreement 292 times. Currently, the Dutch army is launching a larger and more brutal offensive against various regions of Indonesia than before the ceasefire order. On the side of the Republic of Indonesia, it has firmly expressed its will to fight for freedom and independence, repeatedly and sternly rejected the conspiracy of the United States to "mediate" alone, and summoned the Indonesian people to turn "families into fortresses" to resist the enemy. At the same time, the Indonesian government has promulgated new laws to protect overseas Chinese, trying its best to protect the lives and property of our compatriots, which is a serious blow to the provocation conspiracy to incite overseas Chinese to hate Indonesia. However, Chiang Kai-shek's government, disregarding everything, continues its shameful collusion against the Indonesian people. When the Security Council discussed taking further steps to resolve the Indo-Dutch dispute, the Chiang representative completely sided with Dutch imperialism. The Chiang consul stationed in Batavia even arbitrarily organized the "Security Corps" spy organization in the Dutch-occupied areas of Indonesian territory. Our overseas Chinese must be aware of their treachery and beware of Dutch imperialism using this organization as a tool to sow discord between overseas Chinese and the Indonesian people.

### 国际一周

　　国际一周
    一周又过去了，欧洲与远东，仍是国际时局的两大中心。这一周中，反映英美法三国间的勾结与纷争，除英美鲁尔问题会议外，还有两个会议。这就是关于贷款条件修改的英美谈判（十八日在华府举行）及关于德西部工业水平之美英法三国会议（廿二日在伦敦召开）。鲁国问题会议一周来在“不吉利”的气氛中蹒跚不前。修改贷款条件谈判仅进行了四大，在美英双方“咸感前途悲观”的情况下，除美国同意英国暂时停止执行其金镑自由兑换义务外，即草草宣布“其主要阶段已告结束。”会前英所满怀希望华尔街主人能“慈悲”地，放松套在它脖子上的锁链的这一幻想，已象肥皂泡似的破灭了。从美国那里得到的，据美联社报导，却是“决心严格坚持贷款协定。”英国原先还指望在这一谈判中，能得到美国新的“紧急贷款援助”作为其极度恶劣的经济情势的“救命剂”，但得到的却是美国的“催命符。”美国竟专横地提出，要得到美国的贷款，英国必须将其未来政策明白告诉美国政府”，停止钢铁等国有化的更进一步计划”；且提出了“涉及影响英国内政的许多要求”。美国此种乘英国之危利用金元以干涉其内政之妄举，使伦敦“银行家和商界惊慌万状”，连英资产阶级喉舌伦敦新闻记事报也要大呼：“不能向美国压力屈服。”至于德国工业水平会议，也同样反映英美还加上法国间的钩心斗角，不过在这里，英国因有法国参加对美讨价还价时地位增强了。对于这个会议，苏联已正式提出抗议，指出此举是背弃波茨顿协定的一种非法行径。
    此对“马歇尔援欧计划”惧和失望日益增长的同时，荷兰、瑞士、瑞典等欧洲若干资本主义国家，最近与东南欧新民主国家间的经济关系骤趋活跃，在短短时期内，已先后订有九项贷款、经济或贸易协定，甚至英国，在与匈牙利签订了三年易货协定后，又正在和南斯拉夫积极进行商务谈判了。这是一重大的国际新事件，说明了新民主国家经济的稳定与繁荣，使欧洲的某些资本主义国家已开始懂得：唯有这些国家才能对它们残破的经济真正有所帮助，才是它们进行交易的最可靠、最有希望和保障的主顾。这亦是未来国际局势必然发展的基本趋向之一。
    印荷战事继续发展，过去一周的事实，更确证在美国等支持下的荷兰，其所颁布的所谓停战令，仅是争取时间布置更大规模进攻的一种骗局。这和马歇尔在中国导演过的“停战令”毫无二致。自“停战令”发布迄今，荷兰已破约二九二次，目前荷军正在对印尼各地区发动较停战令前更大的与更残酷的进攻。在印尼共和国方面，已坚决表示为争取自由独立而战的意志，再而三的严拒美国单独“调停”的阴谋，并召唤印尼人民把“家庭变成堡垒”，抗击敌人。同时，印尼政府又颁布了保护华侨新法令，尽力保障我侨胞之生命财产，这对煽动华侨仇视印尼的挑拨阴谋是一个严重打击。但蒋介石政府却不顾一切继续反对印尼人民的可耻勾当，在安理会讨论进一步采取步骤以解决印荷争端问题时，蒋代表完全偏袒荷兰帝国主义方面。蒋驻巴城领事竟擅自在印尼领土之荷占领区组织“保安团”特务组织，我侨胞必须洞烛其奸，并提防荷帝国主义利用这一组织作为进行离间华侨与印尼人民的工具。（新华社陕北二十六日电）
