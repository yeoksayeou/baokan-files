    Yangcheng, Linjian Village
    Purging Landlords, Consolidating Mutual Aid
    [Our Taiyue Dispatch, 1st] The mutual aid group in Linjian Village, Yangcheng County, is purging targets of struggle to consolidate mutual aid. On the evening of the 20th of this month, the village convened a meeting of Farmers' Association members from two neighborhoods to discuss how to consolidate the mutual aid groups. Everyone first pointed out that if the targets of struggle were not purged, the mutual aid groups would have no way to function. Wang Zhenxian said: "The landlord Wang Xingyi often tried to persuade me to leave the group, to work separately and not to engage in mutual aid, and told me to work for him for a few days and eat the water from his storage (water is very difficult to obtain in this village). Who knew that after I hoed the land for him, as soon as I carried the bucket to the water's edge, Wang Xingyi glared at me." So everyone shouted together: "We can't unite internally with these people, purge them!" Then someone suggested that the landlord Wang Lantian should not be included in the cooperative, and that Wang Chengen should not be the director of the carpentry shop, which aroused the bitterness of the carpenter Zhang Yongxian: "I have to suffer Wang Chengen's anger every day in the carpentry shop. I must get him out!" Finally, a total of thirteen targets of struggle were purged.

    阳城临涧村
    清洗地主巩固互助
    【本报太岳一日电】阳城临涧村互助组，清洗斗争对象巩固互助。本月二十日晚，该村召开了两个闾的农会会员大会，讨论如何巩固互助组，大家首先提出不清洗斗争对象，互助组就没办法干了。王真贤说：“地主王兴义在组内时常动员我出组，各干各不要互助，并叫我给他做几天活吃他囤里的水（该村水很困难）。谁知给他把地锄了，担上桶刚走到水边，王兴义就瞪起眼来。”于是大家共同的喊起来：“要这些人我们内部就不能团结了，清洗出去！”接着又有人提地主王蓝田，不该收容在合作社里，王成恩不该当木匠铺理事，激起了木匠张永贤诉起苦来：“我在木匠铺里，每天都得受王成恩的气，非将他弄出去不行”，最后共清出斗争对象十三人。
