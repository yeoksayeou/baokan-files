Chengci Xinan Village:
　　How to Organize It?
　　Chengci Xinan Village is a medium-sized village with 164 households, 709 people, and 33 hectares of land, located 12 li from the city. Our work only began after the counter-offensive. This year, after the call for large-scale production, 150 households were organized in five days, totaling 161 male laborers and 52 female laborers, for a total of 213 people. The main experiences in its mobilization and organization are twofold:
　　(1) Combining top-down ideological mobilization to inspire the masses' conscious mutual aid with bottom-up problem identification and resolution.
　　In terms of mobilization content, it started with the issue of the conflict between war support and production, which was most easily accepted by the masses, and adopted the method of posing difficult problems to the masses to create articles: group leaders, village cadres, and activists would promote the difficulties in production to everyone they met, so that the masses would recognize the difficulties and then demand solutions to the difficulties. The specific method of deliberation was that both Party members and non-Party members went down to the grassroots. First, the activists—group leaders and Party members—were mobilized, then a general mobilization was held at a large meeting and an in-depth mobilization in groups, and finally, doubts were answered to honest people who were slower to accept and had special circumstances. In mobilizing women, it was advocated that labor is glorious, and not laboring is shameful, that sisters' groups would not be able to produce, which would be a big shortcoming in the future, and that they would be mistreated when they marry into their husband's family. This point was most effective on old ladies. It was after hearing this that Feng Erqing's mother mobilized her fifteen-year-old daughter, Xiao Shuang, to join the mutual aid group. For their families, the actual benefits of women participating in production and men going out to carry stretchers, using less of other people's labor, were used as motivation.
　　Throughout the mobilization process, there were two major ideological problems that the masses had to solve: First, they were afraid of suffering losses. For example, middle peasants were afraid of paying labor prices, poor peasants felt that they were only working for others, and the problem of owing grain after the autumn harvest was not solving the practical problems of life. Households with cattle and those without cattle, strong and weak laborers, etc., were all afraid of contributing less than others. Second, they were afraid of inconvenience, especially those who also engaged in petty trading. For example, Wang Jiurong was afraid of being left behind by participating in the mutual aid group, but secretly regretted, "This has tied me up, how can I still sell rice?" Wang Bingzhong planted a vegetable garden and couldn't leave it all day long, couldn't earn other people's labor, and was afraid of wasting labor in the vegetable garden with everyone working in the group. Wang Guilin, an old man who farmed 17 mu of land alone, could manage it all by himself, and also had to cook. He was afraid that he couldn't grind flour and eat quickly when he helped each other, and he was tired from being old and wanted to rest but was afraid that everyone would be unhappy. After the village cadres discovered these concerns, they organized the masses to discuss them. In the discussion, the village cadres only gave guidance and did not express their opinions too early, and the groups held decentralized discussions and the congress held centralized voting. In the discussion and after its passage, opinions were sought from various parties and reflections were listened to. After repeated discussions for three or four nights, three general principles were finally clarified, solving the following problems: (1) If there is surplus labor after mutual aid, engage in sideline businesses, and middle peasants do not necessarily have to allocate grain from the land, and the practical living problems of poor peasants are also solved. (2) Everything is based on the principle of equal exchange and non-exploitation, and everyone is rated according to the strength of their labor and the level of their skills; and scores are specifically determined according to the skills and enthusiasm for a certain type of work, and increases and decreases are implemented. (3) Implement work point accounting and distribution of dividends based on work points. This is a problem that must be further resolved after recognizing the need for mutual assistance, otherwise the mutual aid group will become a formalistic "confused" group.
　　(2) Voluntary combination led by activists.
　　After active mobilization, a campaign to establish merit and commend models was launched. More than 40 activists were all mobilized (accounting for one-fourth of the entire village in terms of households), becoming the biggest assistance to the village cadres. After the village cadres divided up the work, the group leader was responsible for the group, and the Party members assisted the group leader, first starting from their own homes, finding those who were compatible and who could talk to each other. Group leaders such as Yang Kuan ran east and west with their rice bowls, and did not rest during their lunch breaks. Yang Shuwen, the director of the Women's Federation, and Wu Shangshu jointly connected 13 people. The eight groups including Zhang Fengchi organized themselves first and went to the fields; after the general meeting commended them, the other groups quickly caught up in order to go to the fields as soon as possible and strive to be models. The village cadres unanimously considered this experience to be the most successful. They said: "If there had not been the active leadership of the group leaders and Party members this time, and only a few village cadres had been doing it in isolation, there would definitely not have been such achievements."

### 成磁西南庄　怎样组织起来？

　　成磁西南庄
  　怎样组织起来？
    成磁西南庄是百六十四户七百零九口人三十三顷地的一个中等村，离城十二里，反攻后才有我们的工作。今年号召大生产后，五天工夫组织了百五十户，共男劳力百六十一，女五十二共二百一十三人。其发动与组织主要经验有二：
    （一）自上而下的思想动员，启发群众互助自觉，与自下而上的发现问题解决问题相结合。
    在动员内容上，是以群众最易接受的战勤与生产矛盾的问题上着手，采取向群众出难题作文章的方法：小组长村干积极分子见人就宣传生产上的困难，使群众由认识困难进而要求解决困难。具体酝酿方式，是党内外一齐下，手先动员了积极分子——小组长、党员，而后开大会普遍的号召及小组的深入动员，最后向接受较慢及有特殊情况的老实人解答疑虑。在动员妇女上，提倡劳动光荣，不劳动则是耻辱，姐妹团不会生产，将来是个大缺点，结婚到婆家要受气。这一点对老太太最能动心，冯二庆娘就是在听了这话之后才动员自己十五岁的闺女小霜参加互助组。对其家庭则从妇女参加生产，男人出担架走了，少用别人的工的实际利益作动员。
    在整个动员过程中，群众思想上有两大问题必须解决：一、是怕吃亏，如中农怕掏工价，贫农觉得光给别人干活，过秋欠粮不解决现实生活问题，有牛户和无牛户，劳力强弱等等，净是怕自己少顶别人多顶。二、是怕不自便，特别是兼作小买卖的，如王九荣怕落白参加互助组，但在背地里又后悔起“这可把我缚起来了，怎还能卖米？”王丙种着菜园，自己整天不能离，不能赚别人的工，又怕组里一齐下地菜园里作活冤工。王桂林只他一个老头种地十七亩，自己满可干过来，还得做饭，怕互助起来不能赶快磨面吃饭了，自己上年纪累得很了想休息还怕大家不愿意。村干发现这些疑虑后，就组织群众进行讨论，在讨论中村干只是启发，不过早表示自己意见，由小组分散讨论大会集中表决。在讨论中和通过后，却多方征求意见，倾听反映。反复讨论了三四夜，最后明确了三个一般的原则，解决了以下问题：（一）互助起来有剩余劳力就搞副业，中农也不一定从地上拨粮，贫农现实生活问题也解决了。（二）一切本着等价交换，互不吃亏的原则，根据劳力强弱技术高低大家评分；且根据对某一种活的技术和积极性具体评定分数，实行增减。（三）实行计工按工分红。这是认识须要互助后必须进一步解决的问题，否则互助组就要变成形式主义的“糊涂”组。
    （二）积极分子带头的自愿结合。
    积极动员后，随即又开展了立功表模运动，四十多个积极分子全动起来了（按户说占全村四分之一），成了村干最大的助力，村干分后，组长负责本组，党员协助组长，首先从自己家开始串连，找着自己心合意合，说得上共得来的。杨宽等组长端着饭碗就东西跑，午睡就不歇，妇会主任杨书文、吴尚书一并串连十三个人。张凤池等八个组，先组织起来下了地；大会表扬后，其他组为了早日下地，争取模范，很快就赶上了。这一经验，村干一致认为最成功，他们说：“这次假若没有组长、党员的积极带头，只几个村干孤立的搞，一定不会有这样成绩。”（冀南三地委办公室）
