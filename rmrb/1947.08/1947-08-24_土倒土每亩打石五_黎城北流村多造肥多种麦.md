　　Applying Soil on Soil Yields Five Stones Per Mu
  　Beiliu Village, Licheng, Emphasizes Manure Production and Wheat Planting

    [This Dispatch from Licheng] Beiliu Village has summarized its seven-day crash hoeing campaign and has successfully completed its task. On the 14th of this month, taking advantage of a break in the heavy rain, labor hero Li Choudu convened a discussion in his team: now that the seedlings have been hoed, what should we do next? Liu Linze, an old man in his sixties, said: "Preparing the wheat fields with fertilizer is the most important thing. With the rain turning everything to mud, planting more wheat will ensure we won't suffer losses." Choudu replied: "Exactly!" The slogan "Expand wheat fields to supplement the autumn harvest shortfall; seize the opportunity to reclaim wasteland, and use the water to prepare fertilizer" was unanimously agreed upon. First, the team established a plan to expand wheat fields and accumulate fertilizer. The team has 21.7 mu of regular crop wheat land. In addition to cotton, peanuts, and autumn crops that cannot realistically be converted to wheat, this year they will convert 29.8 mu to wheat. Based on the existing night soil, sheep manure, and stable manure, totaling 648 loads, an average of more than 30 loads of fertilizer per mu is only enough for the regular crop wheat land. The remaining 9.8 mu of converted wheat land is near the mountainside. Scraping for fertilizer should reach 100 loads per mu. Other land will be supplemented by pressing flower seeds, soaking wheat bran, etc. After his team drew up a detailed plan, the production committee immediately convened a meeting of the brigade leader and team leaders. Li Choudu first presented his plan. Liu Shicheng said: "Doing business without capital, farming without fertilizer is simply impossible! The ancients often said: 'Gaining more fertilizer and soil on one mu is like having two mu.' My father and I can prepare more than 100 loads of fertilizer in half a day.” Zhang Hong said: "What you said is very true. We are not wrong in being led by the Communist Party. Who doesn't remember the life-saving experience of 1943? Accumulating more manure and reclaiming more wasteland is our personal experience. Wheat fields should have soil put on them. Applying soil on soil yields five stones per mu!" Everyone agreed: "Exactly! We already have this experience!" They all returned to their teams to formulate plans for expanding wheat fields and accumulating manure. The whole village has 824.4 mu of regular crop wheat land and 154 mu of converted wheat land. Under the active leadership of various heroes and models, the whole village prepared 940 loads of fertilizer and scraped 120 loads of wasteland in half a day, ensuring that each mu of regular and converted wheat land has more than 30 loads of fertilizer. They are now actively carrying out the manure accumulation campaign. (Pei Yi, Han Qing, Wen Xiu)

　　土倒土每亩打石五
  　黎城北流村多造肥多种麦
    【本报黎城讯】北流村总结了七天抢锄突击周，已胜利完成任务，劳英李丑犊在本月十四日，趁着天降大雨的空闲，召开本组讨论：苗已锄完，应该干啥？六十多岁老汉刘林则说：“准备麦地肥最要紧，雨下的这样稀泥烂透，多种些麦子保险吃不了亏。”丑犊接着说：“就是呀！”“扩大麦田，补充秋季收成不足，趁垧刮荒，趁水沤肥”的口号，大家一致同意，首先在本组订出扩大麦田积肥计划，全组有正荏地麦廿一亩七分，除了棉花、花生与实际不能改麦的秋庄稼外，今年要改麦二十九亩八分，按现有圊肥、羊肥、圈肥，共折合六百四十八驮，每亩平均三十余驮肥，只够正茬麦地用，其余改茬麦有九亩八分靠近山坡，用刮荒肥每亩要达到一百担，另外的地，用榨花籽，沤麦糠等来补充。经他组具体订出计划后，生产委员会当即召开大队长、组长会议，李丑犊首先将自己计划作了发言，刘士成说：“做买卖没本，种地没肥根本是不行的！古人常说：多拦肥土一亩顶二亩。我父子三人半天即沤肥一百多驮。”张鸿说：“你这话说的很对，共产党领导咱就没错，四三年救命经验，谁还不记的吗？多积粪，多刮荒，这是咱们的亲身体验，麦地宜上生土，土倒土每亩打石五！”大家一致说：“就是呀！咱们已有这种经验啦！”都纷纷回到自己组里订扩大麦田积粪计划。全村共有正茬麦地八百二十四亩四分，改茬麦一百五十四亩，在各个英雄模范积极带头下，全村半天沤肥九百四十驮，刮荒一百二十驮，保证正麦改麦，每亩均上三十驮以上肥，现正在积极开展积肥运动。（培义、汗清、文秀）
