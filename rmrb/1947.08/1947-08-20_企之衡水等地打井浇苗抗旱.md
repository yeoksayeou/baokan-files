　　Qi Zhi, Hengshui and Other Places Dig Wells to Irrigate Seedlings to Fight Drought
    [Our newspaper, Southern Hebei, 18th dispatch] Qi Zhi and other counties are protecting seedlings and increasing production. In twenty-seven days, the fourth district of Qi Zhi county dug ninety brick wells, eighty earth wells, and unearthed nineteen old wells. Thirteen new wells will soon be completed. Each well is expected to irrigate ten mu of land, meaning that more than twenty hectares of seedlings are expected to increase production. The Huangtun Dawa area of ​​the fourth district of Wucheng has suffered from floods of the Yima Jiao River every year. Seventy-eight hectares of fields are often submerged. This year, the autumn seedlings are strong, and the masses are even more afraid of flooding. A few days ago, the masses in fifteen villages in the district mobilized to dig drainage ditches, reducing flooding. It is expected to increase grain production by more than one million jin. In particular, the fields in Yin Jiawa have not been short of water for several years. This year, more than ten hectares of autumn seedlings have been spared from flooding, and production per mu can be doubled. In the tenth district of Wei County, more than 20,000 people eliminated more than 96,000 mole crickets, nearly 2,000 field rollers, nearly 4,000 cutworms, more than 3,000 rats, and more than 10,000 sparrows in three days, saving more than 590,000 jin of grain from insect damage.
    [Our newspaper, Southern Hebei, 18th dispatch] Hengshui and other places in the eleventh district have been threatened by severe drought. The county party committees of various counties are actively organizing the masses to do everything possible to rescue the situation. Since July, most areas in the district have not received soaking rain. Although the late seedlings were once better, they are now also withered. South of the old city of Hengshui and north of Zhengjia River, an area of more than ten li in radius is a barren land. The masses in Yuan Luozhuang and Zhaoqiao areas in the fourth district of Wuyi County have already pulled out the dried millet and corn seedlings to use as firewood. The masses in the Shou Xing area have begun to sell cattle and carts, preparing to flee the famine. In most areas of Ji County and Zaoqiang, the corn is as dry as twisted rope. The early seedlings cannot form grains, but the late seedlings have already emerged. On August 4, the prefectural committee called on all cadres and masses to mobilize urgently, put aside or postpone other work, and devote all their efforts to leading the irrigation of seedlings and planting buckwheat, proposing that three people guarantee the survival of one mu of seedlings, and pointed out that if they can accumulate and eat wild vegetables, tree leaves and other substitute foods, and a family rushes to plant a few mu of seedlings, they will be able to survive the famine year, so as to lay the foundation for the masses to overcome the famine with confidence, and widely call for self-help and meritorious service. The Wuyi County Party Committee proposed to irrigate one more mu of land and save one more person, using one's own sweat to save one's own life, and each person to collect ten jin of vegetables. The campaign to rescue the disaster is underway in the district.

    【本报冀南十八日电】企之等县保苗增产。企之四区二十七天内打砖井九十眼，土井八十眼，挖出旧井十九眼，还有十三眼新井不久就可打成。每眼井按浇十亩地计，即有二十多顷禾苗增产可望。武城四区黄屯大洼，年年遭受义马蛟的水灾，七十八顷田野常被吞没，今年秋苗很壮，群众更怕淹没。日前该区十五个村子群众一齐动员挖掘顺水沟，减少了水患，可增产粮食百余万斤。特别尹家洼地里，数年来没有断水，今年十余顷秋苗免去水患，每亩能增产一倍。威县十区两万余人三天内消灭蝼蛄九万六千余个，地排子近两千个，大眼贼近四千个，老鼠三千余，麻雀万余只，使可收五十九万多斤粮食的土地免于虫灾。
    【本报冀南十八日电】十一分区衡水等地已遭严重灾荒威胁，各县县委正积极组织群众全力抢救。该区自七月迄今，绝大部地区未落透雨，虽晚苗一度较好，现亦干枯，衡水旧城以南，郑家河以北，方圆十余里，一片赤地。武邑四区袁罗庄、赵桥一带群众，已将枯死之谷子、棒子苗拔去当柴烧。寿兴一带群众，已开始卖牛卖车，准备逃荒。冀县、枣强大部地区，棒子晒得如拧绳，早苗不能成粒，晚苗却已出穗。地委于八月四日号召全体干群紧急动员，放下或推迟其他工作，全力领导浇苗、种荞麦，提出三个人保证浇活一亩苗，并指出如能积存和吃用野菜树叶等代食品，一家抢种几亩苗，就能过荒年，以奠定群众渡荒信心，广泛号召自救立功。武邑县委提出多浇一亩地，多救一个人，用自己的汗，救自己的命，每人采菜十斤。该区抢救灾荒运动正开展中。
