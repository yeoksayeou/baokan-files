　　Saving Newspapers
  　Pingshun Implements Joint Subscription and Joint Reading
    [Our Newspaper Pingshun Dispatch] In order to save newspapers and support the front lines, the post office convened secretaries of various agencies and heads of various businesses on the 9th to discuss methods for saving newspapers: (1) Agencies: Joint subscription and joint reading, reduce newspapers. The county government reduced from four copies to two copies, and all sections went to the office for collective study. The Bureau of Industry and Commerce and the bank jointly subscribed to one copy for mutual reading and collective study. The County Committee, Public Security Bureau, and Armed Forces Committee each subscribed to one copy due to the distance of their residences. (2) Businesses jointly subscribe by street. Hengshunxiang and the Retired Servicemen's Cooperative used to subscribe to one copy each, but now they jointly subscribe to one copy for joint reading. Lishun Hospital does not subscribe, but reads with Hengji Sales Department. The First District Cooperative, Cultural Cooperative and other businesses do not subscribe, but go to the Civil Education Center to read. After this discussion, a total of six newspapers were saved, which can increase six new subscribers in the new district. (Zu Xun, Luo Ying)
