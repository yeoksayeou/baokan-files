　　Taiyue Guerrilla Warfare Achieves Major Victory
　　Wu Zong Determines Future Struggle Policies
　　Carry out Land Reform in Border Areas; Develop New District Militia
　　Organize Expeditionary Rotation Warfare in the Hinterland; Strengthen Political Work Construction

　　[This newspaper's dispatch from Taiyue, 25th] The first conference of county directors convened by the Taiyue Military Commission General Headquarters, which began on July 10th and lasted for one month, concluded on August 13th. In the last two days of the conference, Comrade Cao Pu, Director of the Wu Zong, delivered a concluding report, pointing out that the people's guerrilla warfare in our area has seen new developments compared to the Anti-Japanese War period. Over the past year, with the shattering of peaceful illusions and the deepening of the land reform movement, under the mass-based patriotic self-defense and land-reform-protecting guerrilla warfare, unprecedentedly great achievements have been made.

　　First, the democratic base areas in the countryside have been upheld and expanded, safeguarding the people's sacred cause of liberation. Since July of last year, under the large-scale offensive by the Chiang-Yan armies, from Pingyao in the north to the Yellow River in the south, on a thousand-mile front, all counties except Jishan have held their ground. Starting with the counter-liquidation movement in the second district of Yuanqu, a widespread anti-counter-liquidation movement was launched, smashing the feudal forces attempting to restore their power, thereby severing Chiang Kai-shek and Yan Xishan's devilish claws extending into the countryside, preventing the enemy's iron hooves from penetrating deep, shattering the enemy's illusion of "occupying the surface," and tightly encircling the enemy in several isolated "white spots" along the Tongpu Railway and the Yellow River, preventing them from lightly crossing the boundary line. In coordination with local armed forces, enemy and puppet strongholds such as Hongdong County Town, Subao, Hanlue, etc., were forced to retreat, expanding the people's base areas. The natural barrier of the Yellow River could not stop the sharp edge of our militia's activities. The militia of Jiyuan and Wangwu frequently operated on the south bank of the Yellow River. The militia of Hongzhao and other counties frequently operated west of the Fen River, thereby safeguarding the interests of the people, covering the land reform, and especially enabling the field army to concentrate its forces without any concerns, achieving the goal of annihilating a large number of enemies. Second, the enemy's effective strength was eliminated. In the one year from July of last year to the end of June this year, more than 11,000 Chiang-Yan troops were annihilated, including 13 enemy regimental-level cadres and 26 battalion-level cadres. The ratio of enemy to our losses was 18 to 1. Third, the people's armed forces have developed greatly in the victorious struggle. The militia in the entire area has grown to ××0,000 people, including ×× field companies that can be dispatched to distant areas at any time, and possess American equipment such as mortars and heavy machine guns. What is especially important is that on the basis of land reform, liberated peasants have joined the militia, consciously taking up weapons, thus greatly improving the political quality and combat skills of the militia.

　　After summarizing the achievements and basic experiences of the past year (see separate article), Comrade Cao Pu put forward the policies and tasks for the construction of the people's armed forces in welcoming the upcoming large-scale counter-offensive. (1) Further launch the guerrilla warfare of land reform in the border areas. First, it is necessary to launch the "two-in-one" movement, learning from the experiences of Yuebei's Tongpu Railway counties and Du Balian. Under unified leadership, war and land reform should be combined, so that guerrilla warfare covers land reform, and guerrilla warfare is further developed on the basis of land reform. Second, besiege the "white spots," learning from Du Balian's experience, try to push the blockade line towards the enemy's strongholds, cut off the enemy's grain supply, and launch a blasting blockade. Third, widely launch the blasting movement, learning from the experience of Shang Qingfu, the blasting banner bearer of the entire region, and apply it to all aspects of guerrilla warfare, in order to achieve the goal of killing and wounding the enemy as much as possible. Fourth, launch political offensives and disintegration movements, striving to win over puppet and diehard elements to return to our side. Resolutely help those who wish to return home, and pay attention to cultivating "disintegration heroes." Fifth, launch waterborne guerrilla warfare, learning from the experience of Wangwu and other places, to attack the enemy on the water and across the river. (2) Organize relatively concentrated expeditionary rotation warfare, learning from Yangcheng, Jincheng, and other counties, and emulate the model expeditionary company of Ye Mingzhu. For this purpose, it is necessary to establish the concept of expedition, recognize that expedition is the main content of the people's armed work in the heartland counties, and establish a fixed establishment, separating the field militia from the guard militia. As for the equipment of the field militia, it should be solved from production and war spoils, and should not be apportioned to the masses to increase their burden. (3) Develop the militia in the new areas in large numbers, but it must be based on the liberation of the masses. It is wrong to arm first and then mobilize. It is also wrong to divide it into mass movement stages and armed stages. The peasants must be armed in the process of liberation. Poor peasants should be the backbone, and middle peasants should be absorbed to participate. Those who are targeted for struggle and bad elements are not allowed to participate. The militia must be developed through the mass line to ensure the purity and organizational consolidation of the people's armed forces. (4) Strengthen the construction and organization of political work. We must pay close attention to the political work of the militia in order to eliminate certain backward ideas and behaviors, so that the quality and combat effectiveness of the militia can be greatly improved.

　　太岳游击战争已获重大胜利
  　武总确定今后斗争方针
    开展边地土地改革发展新区民兵
  　腹地组织远征轮战加强政工建设
    【本报太岳二十五日电】太岳武委总会召集的首次各县主任会议，自七月十日起，历时一月，已于八月十三日结束。大会最后两日，由武总主任曹普同志作总结报告，指出我区人民游击战争，较抗日时期有新的发展。一年来，随着和平思想的打破及土地改革运动的深入，在群众性的爱国自卫、保护翻身的游击战争下，获得了空前伟大的成绩。
    第一、坚持并扩大了农村的民主阵地，保卫了人民神圣的翻身事业。自去年七月以来，在蒋阎军大举进攻之下，北起平遥、南抵黄河，在千里的战线上，除稷山一县外，都坚持住阵地，以垣曲二区反倒算为起点，广泛展开了反倒算运动，打垮了企图复辟的封建势力，从而斩断了蒋阎伸向乡村的魔手，阻止了敌人铁蹄的深入，粉碎了敌人“面的占领”的幻想，将敌人团团围困于同蒲线与黄河岸几个孤立的“白点子”里，而不敢轻越雷池一步。并配合地方武装，逼退了洪洞县城、苏堡、韩略………等敌伪据点，扩大了人民的阵地。黄河天险也阻不住我民兵活动的锋芒，济源、王屋民兵，经常活动到黄河南岸。洪赵等县的民兵，经常活动到汾河以西，从而保卫了人民的利益，掩护了土地改革，尤其是使野战军毫无顾虑的集中力量，达到大量歼灭敌人的目的。第二、消灭了敌人的有生力量，自去年七月至今年六月底的一年中，歼灭蒋阎军一万一千余人，内包括敌团级干部十三人，营级干部二十六人，敌我损失比例为十八比一。第三、人民武装在胜利的斗争中，全区民兵已发展到××万人，其中有××个野战连，随时可以奉命远征，并拥有迫击炮、重机枪等美式装备。而尤其重要的是在土地改革的基础上，翻身农民涌入民兵，自觉的拿起武器，因而民兵的政治质量与战斗素养，都空前的提高了。
    曹普同志于总结了一年来的成绩与基本经验（见另文）后，提出在迎接行将到来的大反攻中，人民武装建设的方针与任务。（一）进一步展开边地土地改革的游击战争。首先要展开“两位一体”运动，学习岳北同蒲线各县与杜八联的经验。在一元化的领导下，使战争与土改结合进行，使游击战争掩护土地改革，并在土改基础上进一步发展游击战争。其次是围困“白点子”，学习杜八联的经验，尽量将封锁线推向敌人的据点，断绝敌人粮道，展开爆炸封锁。第三要广泛展开爆炸运动，学习全区爆炸旗手尚清福的经验，运用到游击战争的各个方面去，以达到尽量杀伤敌人的目的。第四、展开政治攻势及瓦解运动，争取伪顽来归，愿回家者坚决帮助他们回家，并注意培养“瓦解英雄”。第五、展开水上游击战争，学习王屋等地经验，袭击水上及隔河的敌人。（二）组织比较集中的远征轮战，要向阳城、晋城等县学习，向远征模范夜明珠连看齐。为此必须树立远征观念，认识远征是腹心各县人民武装工作的主要内容，并建立固定的建制，将野战民兵与警卫民兵分开编制。至于野战民兵的装备，应以生产中战利品中求得解决，不能向群众摊派增加群众的负担。（三）大量发展新区的民兵，但必须建立在群众翻身的基础上，先武装、后发动是错误的，分成群运阶段、武装阶段同样也是错误的，要在翻身的过程中，将农民武装起来，要以贫农为骨干，吸收中农参加。斗争对象与坏分子，不准吸收参加。要经过群众路线去发展民兵，以保障人民武装的纯洁与组织的巩固。（四）加强政治工作的建设组织。必须十分重视民兵的政治工作，以肃清某些落后的思想与行为，使民兵的素质与战斗力大大提高一步。
