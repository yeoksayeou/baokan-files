　　Military Region Political Department Issues Instructions
  　Calls on Troops Throughout the Region to Launch Political Offensive Against the Enemy
    [Special Dispatch from This Newspaper] After a portion of General Liu Bocheng's large army penetrated into the KMT-controlled areas for combat, the remaining KMT troops in Western Shandong, Northern Henan, and Southern Shanxi were even more deeply encircled by our army. Their wavering and war-weariness are becoming increasingly serious, while a portion of reactionary KMT troops will inevitably struggle like cornered beasts. The Political Department of the Jin-Ji-Lu-Yu Military Region has therefore issued instructions, calling on all our troops in the region to combine military offensives with political offensives against the enemy, to compress, besiege, harass, and gradually annihilate the enemy.
    I. Actively strike at the enemy's conscription and grain grabbing, and actively protect the interests of the people. In the border areas, closely organize militia joint defense, and effectively protect manpower and grain. All armed work teams and guerrilla units must penetrate into the KMT-controlled areas to directly address the people's immediate needs, universally raise slogans against conscription and grain requisition, incite the people's anti-KMT movement, and strike at the enemy's conscription and grain requisition atrocities. Pay special attention to our army's mass discipline, and firmly establish our army's prestige in protecting the people's interests among the masses.
    II. Conduct widespread propaganda work against the enemy. Having suffered continuous annihilation and strikes by our army, KMT troops in various places have strong sentiments of defeat and war-weariness, and most are afraid to fight our army, fearing being annihilated and killed. We should seize upon all well-known battles and campaigns where the enemy was annihilated and the victorious record of our army throughout the year, and repeatedly publicize the truth that our army is becoming stronger as it fights, the KMT army is becoming weaker as it fights, our army will surely win, and the KMT army will surely be defeated. This will make KMT troops universally feel that fighting our army will only lead to death in the end, and it is better to seek a way out as early as possible. And expose Chiang Kai-shek's crimes of betraying the country and harming the people, as well as the tragic fate of KMT officers and soldiers who died in battle and were removed from the rolls, and the devastation and suffering suffered by their families. Vigorously explain that even if American imperialism provides further aid to Chiang, it cannot save him from destruction, and widely arouse the anti-war and war-weary sentiments of the KMT troops. Conscientiously publicize our army's policy on prisoners of war, eliminate their fears and doubts, and make them happy to submit and surrender to us.
    III. Resolutely suppress local tyrants, secret agents, despots, return corps and other reactionary elements who harm the people, remove the KMT troops' claws, and eliminate evil for the people.

　　军区政治部发布指示
  　号召全区部队对敌展开政攻
    【本报特讯】刘伯承将军大军一部深入蒋管区作战后，残留鲁西、豫北、晋南蒋军，更陷入我军重重包围，动摇厌战情绪日益严重，而一部反动蒋军则必会作困兽挣扎，晋冀鲁豫军区政治部为此特发布指示，号召我全区部队结合军事进攻，开展对敌政治攻势，压缩、围困、袭扰，以至逐步的歼灭敌人。
    一、积极打击敌人抓丁、抢粮、征丁、征粮，积极保护人民利益。在边缘区严密组织民兵联防，切实保丁保粮，各武工队与游击队须深入蒋区直接结合人民切身要求，普遍提出反对征兵征粮口号，激起人民反蒋运动，打击敌人征兵征粮暴行。特别注意我军群众纪律，在群众中强固建立我军保护人民利益的威信。
    二、普遍对敌进行宣传工作。各地蒋军在遭我军连续歼灭打击下，官兵失败厌战情绪浓厚，大多畏怯与我军作战，唯恐被歼灭被打死。我应抓紧一切著名歼敌的战役战例及我军全年胜利战绩，反复宣传我军愈战愈强，蒋军愈战愈弱，我军必胜，蒋军必败这一真理，使蒋军普遍感到与我军作战最后只有死亡，不如及早寻求生路。并揭发蒋介石卖国殃民罪行及蒋军官兵战死编余的悲惨下场，和他们的家属所受摧残苦难。极力说明美帝国主义虽再援蒋亦不能挽救其灭亡，广泛激起蒋军反战厌战情绪。切实宣传我军俘虏政策，消除其疑惧心理，使其乐于向我归顺投诚。
    三、坚决镇压土顽特务、恶霸、还乡团等残害人民的反动分子，拔去蒋军爪牙，为民除害。
