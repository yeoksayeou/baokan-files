　　Zao Town · Song Village
  　Grasp Equivalent Wage Readjustment
  　Consolidate Mutual Aid to Promote Weeding
    [Reported from Licheng by our newspaper] In Zao Town's main village, mutual aid was based on equivalent value. Since the beginning of spring, each work-day was valued at ten jin of rice, and work was very enthusiastic. After the wheat harvest, the drought was severe. With one work-day equaling ten jin of rice, the monthly cost was nine dou of rice, requiring one shi and eight dou, which could only be harvested from two mu of grain. The people did the math and were afraid to hire labor. Village Chief Zheng Fusheng understood the people's concerns and convened a meeting of mutual aid team leaders. Everyone suggested that mutual aid should primarily be based on exchanging labor, and if labor couldn't be exchanged, wages could be paid, readjusting the rate to four jin of rice per work-day. After each person ate two and a half jin, the remaining one and a half jin was the wage. After the rain fell on the ninth and eleventh of the seventh lunar month, the leadership failed to grasp the equivalent value in a timely manner, and the wages were still set at four jin of rice as during the drought. Many fields were overgrown with weeds. The corn needed topdressing fertilizer, and vacant land was being planted with buckwheat and vegetables, so life was very tight. The heroic Zheng Detang's mutual aid team, Zheng Songcai, and Tuosheng lacked manpower and requested personnel adjustments, but they couldn't get them; Zheng Tangze and Wang Nailin had manpower, but figured that earning four jin of rice a day wasn't worth the busy work. Busy work, in addition to meals, earned them 500 yuan, which could buy a large sheng of rice, so they were unwilling to work for the team, claiming they were sick and couldn't move, but they were working on their own land. The heroic Zheng Detang spoke with them to understand their thinking and realized that they felt the equivalent value was too low. Therefore, he convened a meeting of all 33 households in the team and discussed the equivalent value based on the rain. Zheng Shuyi said, "These days, we can't adjust people, I'm afraid it's because the wages are too low." Zheng Erwang and others said, "The four jin of rice wage was set during the severe drought. Now it has rained, and based on what we see, the small seedlings will have a good harvest in the fall, estimated at six or seven dou. If the wages are low, we can't adjust people, so we must raise the equivalent value." Zheng Tangze and Wang Nailin said, "It has to be worthwhile." The heroic Zheng Detang said, "Equivalent value is the soul of the mutual aid team. Let's divide into groups and discuss it carefully." After discussion, everyone agreed to change it to six jin of rice a day. After eating two and a half jin, they still earned three and a half jin of rice. That night, everyone was willing to adjust labor, and the team's work became enthusiastic again. During the whole village meeting, the heroic Zheng Detang introduced his team's experience of raising wages and consolidating mutual aid, and everyone became motivated. The problem of not working enthusiastically was the low equivalent value. Everyone believed that, based on the current situation, a unified equivalent value of six jin of rice per day for the whole village was the most appropriate. By understanding people's thoughts and eradicating the root cause, the production work in Zao Town was set in motion. (Fuxiang, Fusheng, Qitang, Shanji, Songde, Shide)
    [Reported from Lucheng by our newspaper] Song Village in the Fourth District is a new district. After land reform, the peasants' enthusiasm for production is high. During the enemy occupation, there were 66 head of livestock; this year it has increased to 139. When organizing mutual aid, the wages were set very high. For example, the wage for carrying manure was five sheng of rice per work-day with meals, and six sheng of rice without meals. Ordinary wages were one sheng lower than carrying manure. The wages for peasants and those who were objects of struggle were the same. Livestock wages were converted based on labor wages, calculated based on land and living conditions. Plowing one mu of land was equivalent to one work-day, harrowing three mu was equivalent to one work-day, and sowing three mu was equivalent to one work-day. This wage system worked during the spring, but once the first weeding was finished, some teams collapsed, and production enthusiasm was low. During the third weeding and topdressing fertilizer application, the masses complained that the wages were too high and they couldn't hire people, and that only wasteland wouldn't lose money. The leadership immediately had the masses, in mutual aid team units, clear and settle past wages and discuss setting future wages. Miao Chengxian said, "My family farms more than ten mu of land, and we have to pay six dou of rice in wages. We can't afford it, we really can't farm this land." Li Laicheng said, "My team used to be very good, but after weeding, after calculating the accounts, several families, including San Guniang and Zhao Chuntang, couldn't afford the wages, and mutual aid collapsed. With these wages, my team can't work, let alone harvest the land." Zhou Laiyun said, "This year's wages are too high and very inappropriate. Our peasants suffer losses, and the landlords benefit. There are several landlords in my team. The landlord Wei Facheng alone earned more than nine dou of millet. Look at the whole village, there are more than thirty objects of struggle. How much wages will they earn? This allows them to turn over again. No wonder they don't farm the bad land that we left for the landlords. This year, the wages are better than farming."
    After discussion, everyone agreed that wages had to be lowered to complete the third weeding and topdressing, and a new wage system was set: the wages for landlords and objects of struggle were reduced to half a sheng. The landlords and objects of struggle were separated into mutual aid teams, and they were required to work every day. Whoever they worked for could pay them rice at the peasant's wage, but aside from the landlord's due of half a sheng, the rest was given to everyone. This allowed for both the management of the objects of struggle and the overcoming of the difficulty of peasants not being able to afford wages. The peasants' wage was one and a half sheng per work-day, and three and a half sheng of rice without meals. Carrying manure, which was heavy work, could be increased by one sheng, and the distribution of work was still determined by the strength, skill, and technique of the labor, as in the past. Livestock wages remained unchanged. Everyone felt that this was good after the decision. Cao Shengfang said, "I have to quickly teach my team how to harvest the land. It seems that farming is still worthwhile." Everyone's enthusiasm for production is high, and they are now organizing to harvest the land and apply topdressing fertilizer.

　　枣镇·宋村
  　掌握等价重订工资
  　巩固互助推动锄苗
    【本报黎城讯】枣镇主村互助等价，入春以来每工米十斤，工作很起劲。麦收后旱灾严重，一工十斤米，每月折米九大斗，需要一石八斗，得二亩谷才收够，老百姓算了帐不敢用工。村长郑福盛摸透了群众心思，召开了互助组长会议，大家提出互助主要是工换工为主，换不了工，可给工资，改定每工四斤米，每人除吃二斤半外，余一斤半米。阳历七月初九与十一落了透雨，在领导上没有及时掌握等价，工资还是按灾荒时定的四斤米，很多庄稼地都长起草来，玉茭需要上追肥，空白地等正在种荞麦撒菜，生活很紧。英雄郑德堂互助组、郑松才、脱生无人力要求调剂人，调剂不到；郑堂则、王乃林有人力，打算盘一天赚四斤米不胜打忙工，打忙工除管饭一工还赚洋五百元，能买米一大升，所以就不愿给组内做活，推说有病不能动弹，却到自己地动弹。英雄郑德堂就和他二人谈话摸揣心思，才了解了是嫌等价低，因此召开全队三十三户会议，根据落了透雨讨论等价，郑书义说：“在这几天调剂不到人，只怕是工资低的原因”。郑二旺等说：“从前四斤米工资是灾荒严重定的，现已落透雨，按现在看小苗秋后收成好的，估计能收六七斗，工资低就调剂不到人，必须往高提一提等价”。郑堂则、王乃林说：“总得合来帐才行”。英雄郑德堂说：“等价是互助组的灵魂，咱划分开小组好好讨论”。讨论后一致同意改为六斤米一天，除吃二斤半米外，还赚三斤半米，当夜调剂劳力都愿意，全队工作又热烈起来。全主村会议时，英雄郑德堂介绍他队提高工资，巩固了互助，大家才起了劲儿，工作不起劲就是等价低的毛病。大家认为按目前情况全村统一六斤米等价最为适当，这样摸揣心思，刨了病根，枣镇的生产工作才形成了运动。（富祥、福盛、起堂、善继、松德、士德）
    【本报潞城讯】四区宋村是新区，农民经过土地改革生产情绪高涨，敌在时有牲口六十六头，今年即增至一百卅九头，组织互助时工资订的很高，如担粪工资，管饭一工米五升，不管饭米六升，平常工资低于担粪一升，农民和斗争对象工资都是一样。牲口工资是按劳力工资折合，按土地生活折工，犁一亩地顶一工，耙三亩顶一工，种三亩顶一工。这样工资在春季还能行的通，一到锄完头次苗，有的组即垮台了，生产情绪不高。锄三遍苗与上追粪时，群众喊叫工资太大，不能用人，只有荒地不能赔本等。领导上当即让群众以互助组为单位，清理与结算过去工资，讨论订出今后工资。苗成先说：“我家种十几亩地，就出六斗米工资，咱出不起，真是没法种这地啦。”李来成说：“我这组过去一圪塔劲可好啦，可是锄苗后一算帐，就有三闺女、赵春堂等好几家出不起工资，互助即垮了。照这样工资，我这组不能干，更不要想搂地啦。”周来运说：“今年工资大，很不合适，咱农民吃亏，地主讨便宜，我那组好几个地主，光地主魏发成就赚了小米九斗多，看看全村有三十多家斗争对象，要赚多少工资，这一下又叫人家翻转啦，怨不得咱给地主留下的坏地人家不种，今年这工资比种地还强。”
    经过讨论，一致认为要降低工资才能锄三遍苗与上追粪，又订出新的工资：地主斗争对象的工资降至半升，把地主斗争对象按互助组分开，让他每天劳动，给谁做活谁也可以按农民工资出米，但除地主应得之半升外，其余全部归大家。这样既能管理斗争对象，又能克服农民出不起工资的困难。农民的一工一升半，不管饭三升半米，担粪是重生活可增加一升，仍按过去的死分活计劳力强弱技术高低来决定，牲口工资不变。大家经决定都觉得这样好，曹生芳说：“我得赶快教俺组搂地，这样算来还是种地合帐”。大家生产情绪高涨，现正有组织的进行搂地、上追粪。
