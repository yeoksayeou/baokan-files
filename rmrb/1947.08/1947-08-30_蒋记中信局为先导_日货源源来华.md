Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 28th. Soon after the Chiang government decided to open trade with Japan, Japanese goods have been arriving in a steady stream. Chiang's Central Trust Bureau is spearheading this trade, having recently imported two thousand cheap Japanese bicycles. The Chinese bicycle industry faces the danger of being completely destroyed. According to a United Press dispatch from Shanghai on the 27th, the Shanghai Bicycle Industry Association has requested Chiang's China Trust Bureau to stop selling certain vehicles. The Association claims that Shanghai manufacturers are capable of producing enough bicycles to meet domestic needs.
