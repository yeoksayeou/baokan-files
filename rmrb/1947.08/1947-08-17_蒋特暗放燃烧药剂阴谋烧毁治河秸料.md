Xinhua News Agency, Shandong, 15th—In Yangzhong (newly established county) County, Bohai District, at the Yellow River hazardous work sites of Xiaojiezi, Tangjia, Gaojia Zhifang, etc., a large number of sulfur sticks and another kind of highly flammable agent were recently discovered in the flood prevention straw materials. The sulfur sticks were all wrapped in red burlap, as thick as a finger and about one foot long. The flammable agent was in the shape of flour packets, and would ignite immediately upon coming into contact with flammable materials. The intention of Chiang's army in secretly planting this kind of agent is obviously to facilitate the easy ignition by Chiang's planes during bombing, so as to burn the river management straw materials to ashes. This matter has aroused vigilance everywhere.

　　蒋特暗放燃烧药剂阴谋烧毁治河秸料
    【新华社山东十五日电】渤海区杨忠（新设县）县属小街子、唐家、高家纸房等黄河险工处，近日在防泛秸料中发现蒋特放置之大批硫磺棍和另一种强烈燃烧剂。其硫磺棍均用红麻布包着，粗如手指，长约一市尺。其燃烧剂状如面粉包，稍一接近引火物，立即燃烧。蒋军暗置此种药剂之用意，显系便利蒋机轰炸时易于起火，将治黄秸料付之一炬。此事已引起各地警惕。
