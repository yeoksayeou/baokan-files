    Fushan Cui Village Women
    Strive to Participate in Production
    [This newspaper, Taiyue, 8th] The men go to war, the women focus on production – this has been realized in Cui Village administrative village, Fourth District of Fushan. The village summarized its production for the first half of the year, and the production achievements of the women are astonishing. Many of the village's male full and semi-labor force are working or doing business elsewhere, and this year's war participation tasks are heavier, so the women at home have shouldered major production tasks. All the women in the village who are capable of labor, both full and semi-labor, number 185. They have formed 22 mutual aid groups. In 68 days, they have sown, hoed, and harvested wheat on a total of 3375 mu, accounting for 51% of the village's land. They carried 5440 loads of manure and soil, spun 1434 jin of cotton thread, and wove 25,000 chi of cloth. Guo Huafeng of Zhang Village Women's Group achieved the greatest results, which promoted other mutual aid groups. Her group has 13 people. In 76 days, they hoed wheat on 18 mu, carried 45 loads of manure, harrowed 13 mu. Provided two livestock pens, carried 100 loads of manure; planted cotton on 18 mu, carried water to plant corn and cotton on 21 mu, soybeans on 12 mu, hoed hemp and beans on 10 mu, carried 9 loads of manure, harvested wheat on 1000 mu, spun 96 jin of cotton thread, bleached 52 jin of thread, wove 1100 chi of cloth, and made 97 pairs of shoes and socks (large and small), 38 pairs of trousers and small shirts. In addition, they also earned 16,175 yuan for the village cooperative by fluffing cotton and weaving towels. Household chores such as grinding flour, rolling wheat in the threshing ground, cooking meals, feeding livestock, and delivering meals to the fields are also done very well. The group leader, Xu Lianying, whose own husband went to the front to participate in the war, got up early and worked hard with her three children. Every morning, she first rolled her own field of wheat, and then rang the bell to urge others to get up and go to the field to harvest wheat. Therefore, the men all said: "We can go to war with peace of mind in the future, the women at home can do the work."
