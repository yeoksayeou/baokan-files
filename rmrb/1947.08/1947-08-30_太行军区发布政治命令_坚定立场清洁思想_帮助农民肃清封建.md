　　Xinhua News Agency, Taihang, 26th—The Taihang Military Region recently issued a political order, notifying the people's army under its jurisdiction to wholeheartedly help peasants eliminate feudalism. It first stated: Our army has unconditionally supported and implemented the Party Central Committee's consistent policies on rent reduction and interest rate reduction, anti-traitor liquidation, land reform movements, and other land policies, thereby enhancing the troops' class consciousness and combat effectiveness. The order mentioned that after the peasants launched a general offensive against the landlord class, the landlord class tried every means to hide in the revolutionary ranks, saying: Some of our backward comrades also used the glorious revolutionary banner as a hiding place and shield for the landlord class, creating a phenomenon of opposition to the interests of our Party and the people. The order analyzed that there are also two situations for comrades from the landlord class: Some are comrades with bad backgrounds but firm political standing, who have become stronger through mass movement training. Others are comrades who are not very healthy politically and are prone to embark on the road of counter-revolution. In the future, the people's army must continue to maintain its pure class integrity politically, organizationally, and ideologically, and not be contaminated by landlord thinking. The following four tasks must be carried out immediately: First, political departments, offices, Party committees, and branches at all levels should organize cadres at all levels to hold a "Clearing Feudal Remnants" symposium, using a class perspective to analyze their families, relatives, wives, in-laws, friends, and landlords, and whether they are landlords or peasants. Do not fail to recognize the essence of class and one-sidedly emphasize erroneous statements such as "military families" should be taken care of and the struggle is "too excessive." We must strictly rectify the ideological front. For soldiers, we should carry out a three-check movement of checking class, checking thoughts, and checking positions in all gaps, linking with actual work, and politically improving the troops' understanding and class consciousness. Second, strictly prohibit the troops from interfering with the mass movement and opposing the ideas and remarks of the mass movement. For some comrades with landlord backgrounds, different education should be carried out in their political and ideological changes. Comrades who have a good understanding and handling of the land reform mass movement should be praised and comforted. For some comrades who retain feudal remnants, and whose positions are still not firm on certain issues, the leadership should talk to them more and help them transform their thinking. For landlord class speculators who have infiltrated the troops and are still opposing the mass movement by borrowing revolutionary power and leverage, harboring landlords and their property, or secretly undermining the troops ideologically and stubbornly refusing to repent, a solemn ideological struggle should be launched. Those who repeatedly educate and do not abandon their non-proletarian positions should be expelled from the Party without any leniency. In the future, if any organization or cadre soldier uses armed force to suppress the mass movement, governments at all levels and revolutionary masses should immediately arrest and send them back to their original units. Those with serious circumstances should even be expelled from the military and handed over to the local masses for handling. Personnel from landlord families who have not been thoroughly liquidated by the masses are strictly prohibited from taking leave to go home, but are allowed to write letters persuading their families to bow their heads to the masses. Letters must be submitted to the organization for review. Third, political organs, Party committees, and branches at all levels should immediately investigate all troops, organs, shops, and factories under their jurisdiction, and expel all struggle targets and hand them over to the local government. All personnel participating in the work should re-obtain formal letters of introduction from both the original district and village offices. In the future, anyone who is privately retained without formal documents, regardless of the individual or organization, will be thoroughly investigated for the responsibility of harboring the landlord class. Fourth, political organs of all troops should lead the mass movement of emancipation, and each company should organize a mass movement work group under the leadership of the branch to help local work and report to the higher level regularly. In particular, the troops in the newly liberated areas should earnestly help and use armed cover for land reform as one of the regular political work contents. Personnel who have made achievements in helping the land reform mass movement should be rewarded or given merit.

　　太行军区发布政治命令
  　坚定立场清洁思想　帮助农民肃清封建
    【新华社太行二十六日电】太行军区日前发布政治命令，通知所辖人民军队，要全心全意帮助农民挤封建。首称：我们军队都无条件的拥护与执行了党中央历来的减租减息、反奸清算，土地改革运动等土地政策，从而提高了部队的阶级觉悟和战斗力。该命令提到农民对地主阶级发动总进攻后，地主阶级想尽办法企图向革命阵营中躲避时说：我们一些落后同志，也就用光荣的革命招牌做了地主阶级的藏身所和挡箭牌，与我党和人民利益造成对立现象。命令中分析了地主阶级出身的同志，也有两种情形：一些是出身不好而政治坚定的同志，则因群运锻炼而更加坚强。另一些政治上不大健康的同志，容易走上反革命的道路。今后人民军队在政治上、组织上、思想上，要继续保持其纯洁的阶级整体，不被地主思想所沾污。日前必须进行下列四项工作：一、各级政治部、处，党的委员会和支部，应组织各级干部召开“肃清封建残余”座谈会，用阶级观点分析自己的家庭、亲属、老婆、岳家、朋友、房东，是地主还是农民？不要不去认识阶级本质，而片面强调“军属”应该照顾，斗争“太过火”等错误说法。我们必须严整思想阵地，对于战士应当在一切空隙中，进行查阶级、查思想、查立场的三查运动，联系实际工作，在政治上提高部队认识和阶级觉悟。二、严格制止部队干涉群运和反对群运的思想言论。对地主成份的一些同志，应在其政治上思想上的变化中进行不同教育，对于土改群运认识和处理好的同志，应给予表扬和安慰。一些留有封建尾巴的同志，在某些问题上，一时立场仍不坚定，领导上应多与他们谈话，帮助改造思想。对于混入部队的地主阶级投机分子，仍借革命权位和杠杆反对群运，窝藏地主及其财物，或暗中从思想上瓦解部队而执迷不悟的，应开展严正思想斗争。屡次教育不放弃其非无产阶级立场的，应毫不姑息的直至开除党籍。今后不论任何机关或干部战士，如用武装镇压群运的，各级政府及革命群众，应立即逮捕送原部队。情节重大者，直至开除军籍，交当地群众处理。凡地主家庭未被群众彻底清算的人员，一律禁止请假回家，但允许写信劝说家庭向群众低头，信件必须交组织审查。三、各级政治机关，党委会，支部，应立即清查所属各部队、机关、商店、工厂，把斗争对象，一律挤出去，交地方政府。凡参加工作的人员，应一律再行取得原籍区村公所双方的正式介绍信。今后凡无正式证件，而私自留用的，不论个人、机关，要彻底追究包庇地主阶级的责任。四、各部队政治机关，应领导群众翻身运动，各连队应在支部领导下，组织民运工作小组，帮助地方工作，定期向上级报告。尤其新解放区各部队，应认真帮助，并以武装掩护土地改革，作为经常政治工作内容之一。帮助土改群运有成绩的人员，要进行奖励或记功。
