(This Newspaper, Taiyue, 16th) Since February, Yuebei counties have achieved great results in rectifying financial work and launching a production self-sufficiency campaign. In terms of clearing work, all levels have paid attention to the clearing of grain and funds, and the accounts from the special county down to the district and village have gradually become consistent, overcoming the previous chaotic revenue and expenditure. The five counties of Jiexiu, Huoxian, Lingshi, Anze, and Changzi alone have cleared out 524,000 catties of grain, 560,000 yuan, and 4,300 pairs of military shoes. Secondly, in consolidating local finances, all counties have consistently implemented the policy of combining production for self-sufficiency with production for finance. Most counties have achieved the principle of not levying or levying less. According to incomplete statistics from nine counties, the initial budget for local expenditure this year, in grain alone, has been reduced by 1.33 million catties compared to last year. Counties such as Anze, Zhaocheng, and Qinyuan have combined local conditions to use local grain and funds to engage in coal kilns, textile, and water mill workshops, striving for village expenditure self-sufficiency. In the five counties of the core area, village cadres were streamlined in April, and subsidies were abolished. Tunliu, Anze, and Qin County have all decided that village funds should be self-sufficient. Anze County alone has reduced the burden on the masses by 500 dan. Qin County determines several types of village expenditures based on different situations, except for large joint villages on the main transportation routes of the town government. Qinyuan divides villages into five grades: special, A, B, C, and D, all of which determine a certain expenditure for the village, combining it with production and clearing village finances. Pingyao is also divided into five grades of villages, and the expenditure of the village office and school is fixed. The budget is made once in March, and the calculation is made once a month. Without the approval of the county, arbitrary apportionments are not allowed. In order to further deepen the work, attention is now being paid to the following points: (1) Individual areas have not paid enough attention to leadership, and some areas even only have instructions and arrangements, lacking specific guidance; in the future, it should be developed more deeply and universally. (2) Overcome the tendency to only pay attention to clearing past revenue and expenditure, while lacking research on how to strengthen management in the future. (3) Establish an audit committee to strictly enforce the local budget system. (4) Production for self-sufficiency must be combined with the rectification of finances. Production for self-sufficiency is fundamentally a way to open up financial resources, and rectifying finances is to reduce waste. The combination of the two can truly increase finances and oppose the wasteful phenomenon of villages apportioning funds on their own without overall planning.

　　岳北各县
  　普遍整顿财政争取生产自给
    【本报太岳十六日电】岳北各县自二月份起，整顿财政工作，开展生产自给运动以来，已获巨大成绩。在清理工作上，各级都注意了粮款清理，上自专县下至区村的帐目，都逐渐求得一致，克服了以往混乱收支。只介休、霍县、灵石、安泽、长子等五县，已清理出粮食五十二万四千斤、款五十六万元、军鞋四千三百双。其次，在整理地方财政上，各县均一致贯澈了生产自给和生产财政结合的方针，大部县份，已实现了不派或少派的原则。据九县不完全的统计，今年地方开支初次概算，仅粮食一项即较去年减少一百三十三万斤。安泽、赵城、沁源等县，都结合当地条件，利用地方粮款搞煤窑、纺织、水磨等作坊，争取村开支生产自给。腹心区五县，在四月份，村干部实行了精简，取消了津贴。屯留、安泽、沁县均一律决定村款自给。仅安泽一县，即减少群众负担五百石；沁县按不同情况，确定镇公所交通要道之大联合村外，一般村分几种类型村开支；沁源分特甲乙丙丁五等村，均决定村的一定开支，结合生产，清理村财政。平遥亦分五等村，并固定了村公所学校开支，三月造预算一次，一月造计算一次，不经县批准，不准随便摊派。为进一步深入，今后正注意如下几点：（一）个别地区在领导上还注意的不够，甚至有些地区仅有指示、布置，缺乏具体指导；今后应向更深入更普遍发展。（二）克服只注意清理过去收支，而缺乏今后如何加强管理的研究。（三）成立审委会，严格地方预算制度。（四）生产自给要和整顿财政结合。生产自给基本上是开辟财源的道路，整顿财政是减少浪费，二者结合，才能确实增进财政，并反对不统筹，由村自行摊派的浪费现象。
