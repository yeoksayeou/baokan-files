　　Lou Zeyi Strives to Move Forward
　　Cutting Artemisia and Making Fertilizer to Prepare for Wheat Planting
　　[This newspaper, Wuxiang News] Under the leadership of labor hero Comrade Wang Huwang, Lou Zeyi Village in the Sixth District, because there was very little rain this spring, he had prepared for the famine early, paid attention to early sowing and production savings in the spring, and made every effort to cultivate carefully in agriculture. The mutual aid groups were also consolidated, and they implemented work-point labor and equivalent exchange. Now, the autumn fields in the whole village have generally been hoed three times, and all 1,059.5 mu of wheat land in the village have been plowed once. During this blitz campaign, 50 mu of wasteland were eliminated, 324.5 mu of buckwheat were planted in the whole village, and 181.5 mu of vegetables were planted. In addition to the masses eating vegetables, a net surplus of 8,150 jin of dried vegetables was saved, saving 28 dan of millet, and vegetable-collecting heroes such as Wang Gailan and Hao Nvhai emerged. Currently, the masses are cutting artemisia in large quantities to add fertilizer and prepare for wheat planting. Huwang said, "We must push all our work forward." (Li Fang, Li Jinggang)
　　[This newspaper, Licheng News] All villages in the county attached importance to accumulating fertilizer and expanding wheat fields. After the soil was soaked by rain, they convened households without fertilizer after their land had been returned to discuss fertilizer accumulation. Wang Qin said: It is impossible to farm without fertilizer, just as it is impossible to do business without capital. Zhao Zhi said: After the soaking rain, planting too many vegetables will take up wheat land, and planting wheat in the autumn requires more fertilizer. Wang Qin and others promoted the whole village to hoe and compost 3,020 loads of wheat bran, soil, and manure in one day, with 30 loads applied per mu. Shi Jinshan, an old hero from Xiaokou Village, led the whole village to discuss plowing wheat land three times, and he set an example by plowing it four times. The whole team planned to change the stubble for 40 mu of wheat, promoting fertilizer accumulation of 20,000 loads in Shanghuanxianglu and other villages. When Chengjiashan discussed fertilizer accumulation, Guo Lianqin said: "Let's open an oil mill, earn money and have fertilizer, killing two birds with one stone." Twelve people and three animals pressed 35 batches in ten days, earning 455 oil cakes and 70 jin of oil, enough to fertilize more than 30 mu of land. Qiushuyuan collects Vitex negundo leaves for wheat fields, roasting and grinding them into flour to strengthen the soil and kill insects. Sheep flocks were generally organized to lie on the ground together. Large plots of land were used for sheep to lie on, and small plots were used for trampling circles or applying other fertilizers, always giving priority to the families of revolutionary martyrs and soldiers.
