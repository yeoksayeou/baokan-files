(This article was transmitted by Taiyue on the 30th of this month.) After landlords Xu Hongyi and feudal rich peasant Qiao Yanggong of Lizhuang Village, Anze, were struggled against last year, not only did they not bow their heads to the peasants, but they conspired to counterattack the peasants. They first spread rumors among the masses, falsely accusing activist Wang Qingyi's wife of improper relations, causing the village to lose face, and instructed village head Wang Donghai to convene the masses to struggle against her. Wang Donghai was deceived for a time and carried out their conspiracy. During the struggle, Xu Hongyi and Qiao Yanggong even more wantonly insulted Wang Qingyi for lacking education and said that his wife should be severely beaten. Then the two started beating her. At this time, peasants Li Keyang, Wang Laizhu, and others realized they had fallen for the landlords' trick and angrily stopped them, saying, "The times haven't changed yet, and you landlords are already hitting people." This alerted the masses, who unanimously demanded to re-struggle against the landlords Xu Hongyi and others. On the 7th of this month, a struggle meeting was held in the entire village. Village head Wang Donghai regretted being fooled by the landlords and admitted his mistake to the masses on the spot, followed by the unfolding of the struggle. Old man Lai Bao, while cursing, beat the landlord and said, "The times haven't changed yet, and you dare to hit people. If the times change, you will kill the peasants. Dreaming of changing the times!" The women rushed forward, pointing and scolding the landlord, saying, "You dog who doesn't know what people respect, last year we left you land and many things, but not only do you not repay our kindness, but you come to beat the peasants. This time we won't tolerate you." A lot of weapons were also found in Xu Hongyi's house, five hand grenades, fifty bullets, and a bag of explosives, which further heightened the vigilance of the masses, who felt that eliminating the landlords was a long-term struggle.

    安泽李坡庄农民
    认破阴谋
    再斗地主
    【本报太岳三十日电】安泽李坡庄地主徐鸿义及封建富农乔阳公于去年被斗争后，不仅未向农民低头，反阴谋向农民反攻。他们首先在群众中造谣，诬蔑积极分子王清义女人男女关系不正确，给村里丢人，叫邻长王东海召集群众斗争，王东海一时被骗，便照其阴谋进行了，当斗争时，徐鸿义、乔阳公更大肆辱骂王清义没有教育，其女人应该重重的吊打，接着两人便拖打起来，此时农民李科阳、王来柱等知道中了地主的奸计，立即气愤的拦住了说：“天还没变，你们地主就打起人来了。”由此提醒了群众，一致要求重新斗争地主徐鸿义等，本月七日全村开斗争大会，邻长王东海自悔上了地主的当，当场向群众认错，接着展开斗争。来暴老汉一面骂着，一面打着地主说：“天还没有变，你们就敢打人，天变了你们还要杀了农民，想变天是你的梦想”妇女们拥上前去，指骂着地主说：“你这狗不识人敬的东西，去年给你留下土地和许多东西你不但不报恩，反来打农民，这次可不容你”。又从徐鸿义家里搜出不少武器，手榴弹五颗、子弹五十粒、炸药一包，更提高了群众的警惕，感到消灭地主是长期的斗争。
