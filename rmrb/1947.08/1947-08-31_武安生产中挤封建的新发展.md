　　New Developments in Squeezing out Feudalism in Wu'an Production
　　·Er Dong·
　　Regarding the issue of continuing to pursue and eliminate feudalism in the production movement, Wu'an has gained some important experiences from the actual movement after July 1st, which has led the issue towards resolution. According to the Wu'an County Committee, they had previously studied the experiences of other counties, such as production during the day and struggle at night, production on sunny days and struggle on rainy days, etc. However, when these arrangements were implemented, they never really integrated: when the leadership emphasized production, the struggle disappeared; when the struggle was emphasized, it always affected production. The large amount of wasteland last year was related to this. After July 1st this year, Tianzhong, Tenth District, Sixth District, Third District, and many villages in other districts spontaneously launched a wave of squeezing out feudalism. The county and district committees did not arrange this in advance, but after the movement started, the cadres quickly ran to help and lead, so that it could quickly achieve victory. However, after inspection, the achievements of the movement were great, and it did not affect production. In the Tenth District, 38 of the 40 villages were involved in the movement. Statistics from He Village and other 20 villages show that more than 200 feudal tails of landlords were cut off. Among them, 183 were landlords who had not been thoroughly struggled against in the past, 24 were declining landlords who had never been struggled against (previously mistakenly regarded as middle peasants, but actually disguised landlords), and 20 extremely evil despotic landlords who should have been executed long ago were officially executed. 180 landlords who had infiltrated cooperatives, associations, farmers' associations, militias, and theater troupes were purged. Statistics from 23 villages in the Sixth District show that the results of the seven-day struggle this time were equal to what was achieved in the previous seven months. In the Third District, statistics from Boyan Town alone show that 36 landlords were struggled against, yielding 9,000 catties of grain, as well as a considerable amount of other gold, silver, silk, and clothing. All landlords who had infiltrated various systems were also purged. Previously, many unconscious farmers served as air-raid shelters and deposited property for landlords, and this time they all voluntarily reported it. In Cui Lu and other five villages alone, 94 households voluntarily reported. Many landlord spies who had infiltrated our agencies and troops to sow discord and carry out anti-peasant activities were taken back by the peasants for thorough liquidation, helping the agencies and troops consolidate their organizations and eliminate their threats to the peasants.
　　How did the movement start? According to the county committee, one reason was that during the mobilization to overcome the famine, each village generally linked the suffering of the famine with the exploitation of the landlords (this was more detailed than the accusations in the large-scale mobilization stage last year, arousing more people's class hatred). Comparing the times with the landlords, the landlords still had much more than the peasants. Some peasants said: "The landlord in ×× village is not as bad as ××× in our village, and the people in that village have already struggled against them completely, why haven't we struggled against him completely!" The second reason was that the Party's evaluation and commendation of model workers made the peasants understand more clearly: "Oh! I understand now, it is to call on us to overthrow the landlords and turn over to become masters!" "Every Party member is resolute in the struggle!" "With the Communist Party helping us and leading us, why not do it thoroughly!" "In the past, we only thought that we could not struggle except in winter, but it seems that we can struggle whenever we have time, and the masses can struggle as they please, as long as it does not affect production." With this clarification, the peasants became even more energetic. The third reason was that at that time, there was a long drought, and there was not much farm work, and there were not many ways to pick up and chop firewood. So the Party members took the lead, and the masses followed.
　　Since there was not much spare time, and many peasants still had a lot of sporadic production (partially hoeing seedlings, partially preparing vegetable seeds, small gleaning, weaving), various places took the sudden attack method against the landlords, and detained all the men, women, old and young of the target family separately for separate struggles. In this way, many hidden properties and activities of the landlords were exposed by women and children. Some people doubted, "The father is guilty, but what about the son?" The peasants said, "If the father is detained, the son will steal things, isn't that a crime?" They said, "The laws are made for us peasants, not for the landlords. They didn't guarantee us when they ruled the world, and they didn't talk about laws to us, they did whatever they wanted. Today we will do whatever we want."
　　To divide things in detail requires spending a lot of effort to examine, the peasants said, "We can't delay production, let's set up an examination committee." Some places set up a turn-over team or other organizations in the village, but the tasks given to them by the peasants were almost the same – to examine the targets clearly, to deal with them properly, to track down the hidden goods, to dig out the air-raid shelters, and to determine the distribution methods. In this way, a few people worked at home, and most people went to produce and pick up firewood. If the people at home had work, everyone would do it for them. In this way, production was generally not affected.
　　"Some old middle peasants were afraid of struggle in the past, and this commotion may at least stop them from wanting to produce for a few days." This was the concern of many people. After discussion, the peasants, at the beginning of the matter, elected a class division committee, some simply called it a guarantee committee, and clearly and formally announced its task to the whole village: "Guarantee to thoroughly struggle against the landlords, guarantee not to struggle against the middle peasants." With this, the middle peasants were stabilized, and they all went to produce with peace of mind.
　　In the past, some individual villages had clan struggles between the east and west villages, and between the Zhang and Li surnames, and they had also attacked the wrong people, affecting the mood for production. This time, the peasants stipulated "group discussion, village-wide approval." Class division, determining who to struggle against and how to struggle against them, was very cautious. Therefore, very few people were struggled against wrongly this time.
　　According to the Wu'an County Committee, this spontaneous movement of the peasants gave them great enlightenment. The problem of combining production and mass movements, which had not been thought through for a long time, was now understood. First, in the busy farming season, the squeezing out feudalism struggle should not be arranged rigidly and limited in time. That will inevitably affect production. The technical instruction of "combination" cannot be combined, we must let the peasants find opportunities and think of ways on their own, and do whatever is appropriate, so that they can create specific methods in specific situations. The examination committee seems to have an official nature, but in the minds of the peasants, they have separated from the landlords, completely trust the leadership, and the leadership is completely democratic to the masses. Under the condition that important matters are passed by the masses (Wu'an has a large and in-depth movement foundation for a year), a few people can do the work without affecting the enthusiasm of the masses. Then, what the leadership needs to do is to seize all opportunities (such as mobilizing to overcome the famine, making the Party public, etc.), tell the peasants about the Party's policies, guidelines, and tasks, and inspire the peasants from their lives, history, and actions to combine the Party's intentions consciously with their own intentions, and think of ways to realize them. Thoroughly struggling against the landlords without affecting production is in line with the requirements of the peasants. Once it is understood by the peasants, there is no need to take any compulsory arrangements, and the peasants will pay attention to it themselves during the struggle.

　　武安生产中挤封建的新发展
    ·而东·
    关于生产运动中继续追歼封建的问题，武安从七一后的一段运动实际中获得一些重要体验，使问题趋向解决。据该县县委谈，他们过去也曾研究其他县份经验，如白天生产，夜间斗争，晴天生产，雨天斗争等，但这样布置下去，实际老是结合不起来：领导上强调生产，斗争就没有了；强调斗争，则总是影响了生产，去年荒地不少，即与此有关。今年七一后来天中，十区、六区、三区及其他区不少村庄曾自发地涌起一个挤封建的浪潮。事前县区并未布置，只是运起来后，干部们赶快跑去帮助、领导，使其迅速胜利罢了。但事后检查，运动的成绩很大，也没影响生产。十区四十个村，有三十八村卷入运动。和村等二十村统计，有二百多个地主的封建尾巴被割。其中一八三个是过去没斗透的二十四个是从未斗过的下降地主（以前曾误为中农，实际是化形地主），并有二十个罪大恶极，早该决的奸霸地主被正式处决，一百八十个混入合作社、会、农会、民兵、剧团中的地主被清洗出来。六区二十三村统计，此次七天斗争果实等于上次七个月所得。三区仅伯延镇统计：斗了三十六个地主，得粮九千斤，其他金银、绸缎、衣被都不少，并清洗了所有混入各系统的地主。各地以前有多不觉悟的农民给地主当防空洞、代存财物，这次都纷纷自报出来。仅崔路等五村即有九十四户自报。以前混入我机关、部队中挑拨离间，进行反农民活动的地主特务，有不少已被农民要了回去，彻底清算，帮助机关部队巩固了组织，解除了他们对农民的威胁。
    运动怎样起来的呢？据县委谈，一个原因是动员渡荒时，各村普遍由回忆灾荒痛苦中联系到地主的压榨（这比去年大发动阶段诉的细，唤醒了更多人的阶级仇恨）。与地主比比时光，地主还有许多富于农民的。有的农民说：“人家××村地主××还不如咱村×××坏哩，人家村都斗光啦，咱还不斗光他！”第二个原因是党内评功表模〉彻??倍缘吃庇肴褐诘挠辛?逃?Ｐ矶嗳怂担骸肮膊??我可明白啦，就是叫咱斗倒地主，翻身发家哩！逢党员都是斗争坚决的！”“有共产党帮助咱，领导咱，还不快干个彻底！”“以前只当是非冬天不能斗哩，看来是有空想斗就能斗，群众爱怎斗就怎斗，不生产就行。”这一明确，农民的劲就更足了。第三个原因，当时久旱，农事不甚，拾砍门路也不甚多。于是党员带头、群众跟着就干起来啦。
    空隙时间没有多少，好些农民零星生产还不少（部分锄苗、部分预备菜籽，小拾、纺织），各地便不约而的采取了对地主突然袭的办法，并且是将对象全家男女老少分别扣押，分别斗争。这样，地主的许多隐蔽财产与活动，都由女人孩子很暴露出来。有些人疑说：“老子有罪，儿子可罪呀！”农民说：“扣了老子，儿子就偷拿东西，这不是罪呀？”的说：“法令是给咱农民订的，不是给他地主订的。他们坐天下那时候就没保障过咱，对咱也不讲法令，他想怎就怎。今天是咱想怎就怎。”
    细细分，需要费工夫考，农民们说：“可不能耽搁生产，咱成立个考委员会吧。”有些地方是成立了本村翻身队或别的组织，但农民交给他们的任务都差不多——审清对象，别处理，追清内货，挖清防空洞，订好分果办法等。这样，少数人在家干，大部分人生产拾砍去了。在家人如果有活，大家代办。这样，一般都没误了生产。
    “有些老中农过去就光怕斗争，这一闹恐怕至少要停来天不想生产。”这是许多人的顾虑。农民讨论后，一开始其事的来了个选举划阶级委员会，有的干脆叫做保证委员会，向全村明确的正式宣布其任务：“保证斗透地主，保证不斗中农。”这一下中农稳住了，都安心去生产。
    以前个别村有村东村西、张姓李姓的宗派斗争，也曾打击错人，影响生产情绪。这一次农规定“小组讨论，全村通过”。划阶级，确定斗谁、怎斗，都是很慎重的。所以这次很少斗错人。
    据武安县委谈，农民这次自发的运动给他们启发很大。好久没有想通的生产群运结合问题这次想通了。第一，在农忙季节，挤封建斗争不要硬布置，限间。那样必然影响生产。技术的指示“结合”是结不起来的，必须放手让农民自己去找机会，想办法，怎样合适怎样干，才能在具体情况下创造具体办法。考虑委员会似有办性质，但在农民思想上确已与地主分家，对领导完全信任，领导对群众完全民主，重要事情通过群众的条件下（武安有一年来大与深入运动的基础），可以让少数人去做工夫的事，而不影响群众积极性。那么，领导上需要做的事情就是抓紧一切时机（如动员渡荒，公开党等），把党的政策方针任务等告诉农，从农民生活历史与行动中启发农民领导党的意图自觉地与自己的意图结合起来，想办法实现它。斗透地主，不影响生产，这个方针是符合于农民要求的，只要它一旦为农民所明白，完全不必采取什么强制布置，农民即会在斗争时自己注意到的。
