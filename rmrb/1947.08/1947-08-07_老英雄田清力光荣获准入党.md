    Old Hero Tian Qingli
    Honorably Admitted to the Party
    [Ben Shi Lincheng News] Tian Qingli, a 59-year-old hero from Weichang Village, Lincheng, and a leader in the peasants' emancipation and prosperity, requested to join the Communist Party at the county party committee's conference of labor heroes, model workers, and cadres. After careful consideration and review by the county party committee, he was officially approved to join the Party and a grand admission ceremony was held. Comrade Tian Qingli took the stage amidst applause to talk about his motives and aspirations for joining the Party. He said, "Everyone knows that I moved from Ju Village to Weichang Village with only a carrying pole and started from scratch with a straw box (he only carried a straw box when he moved). I suffered enough in the old society. After the Communist Party came, I was emancipated and became prosperous. The Party also cultivated me to become a hero. I wanted to join the Communist Party in the past, but I could never find it. Today, I have found the Communist Party, and I will never let go, even if I die. Although I am getting older, I can still contribute to the Party and the people." Finally, he solemnly took the oath. (Li Zhen, Feng Xizhen)
