The Gold Ring and the Burden
A Story from the Check-Wind and Pursue-Merit Campaign
Tian Zuoliang

　　Comrade × Yin Zhu, last September, took leave to go home. At that time, the masses in the village were settling accounts with his father. He only stayed for one night and returned the next day. Before leaving, his father secretly gave him a seven-qian gold ring that the masses hadn't confiscated, and told him: "Be sure to hide it well, for when you have no money to spend..."

　　He took the gold ring, as if he had obtained a family heirloom, and was overjoyed. He was afraid of losing it no matter where he put it. He held the gold ring tightly in his hand all the way, feeling more at ease.

　　After returning, he was unwilling to let his comrades know that he had brought a gold ring from home. But he couldn't find a good place to hide it: if he wrapped it in his baggage, he was afraid someone would steal it; if he put it in his pocket, he was afraid the pocket would tear and he would lose it. After thinking about it, he felt it was safer to hide it in the small pocket of his underwear. Every day, while working and studying, he couldn't forget this treasure, and kept secretly touching his small pocket. He always felt like he had lost it if he didn't touch it every now and then; his mind was simply occupied by this gold ring.

　　Once, before dawn, he suddenly shouted in his sleep:

　　"Ah! Who stole the gold ring from my pocket?" The comrades in the room were all awakened. Some comrades immediately got up and asked him, "When did you lose it?" He didn't say anything even after being asked several times, and continued to sleep soundly. Later, everyone realized he was sleep talking.

　　When getting up, everyone joked with him while getting dressed:

　　"Yin Zhu! How many gold rings do you have? You should confess to everyone, confess!" As soon as he heard this, he thought someone had stolen his treasure and was so anxious he almost jumped up. His face immediately turned red. He didn't bother to answer everyone and quickly and quietly touched his small pocket. When he felt the gold ring was still in his pocket, he felt relieved, changed his panicked expression, and said to everyone, "I'm so poor, how could I have a gold ring!"

　　"This is the secret you revealed in your sleep just now!" Everyone deliberately teased him, but he repeatedly explained, "Can sleep talking become reality!" Finally, he laughed it off.

　　Although he explained it that way verbally, he always suspected that everyone might have discovered his treasure. He carried a burden in his mind, so he became more vigilant in his daily life and paid attention to other people's eyes at all times. Especially when everyone talked about their family possessions, he described himself as poor as a beggar.

　　During the ×× battle, the higher-ups asked him to go to the regiment to help with the work, and he set off the next day. From the moment he accepted this task, he felt uneasy. He didn't even want to eat and walked around with his head down, very depressed, but he couldn't say it.

　　"If I sacrifice myself this time at the front, what about the gold ring...? If I entrust it to a close comrade for safekeeping, what if he loses it...? It's even more unreliable to let the villagers hide it...? Should I not go to the front this time? The impact would definitely be bad. Besides, I am a revolutionary comrade, how can I do this just because of a gold ring...?"

　　Such a series of questions made it difficult for him to choose the best solution. He didn't sleep all night. He didn't make up his mind until the rooster crowed. It was better to have Comrade Lao Hou keep it, because Lao Hou had a good personal relationship with him, and he was a bit sick and couldn't go to other places to work.

　　Before dawn, he got up early, packed his luggage, and quietly called Lao Hou outside, saying in a low voice:

　　"There's something you must keep secret for me. If I sacrifice myself this time at the front, you can use this gold ring! Be careful, don't lose it!"

　　Lao Hou took the gold ring and wanted to see what it looked like. But after peeling off more than a dozen layers of paper, it finally showed its face. After a glance, Lao Hou quickly wrapped it up again and put it in the pocket of his undershirt. Yin Zhu still couldn't rest assured, so he ran to the villager's house to get a needle and thread and sewed up Lao Hou's pocket. Lao Hou saw that he was really a careful person and said with a smile, "Yin Zhu! Don't worry, work hard for the people at the front! I will definitely not lose it for you."

　　After breakfast, he set off, still thinking about his gold ring all the way. He planned: the gold ring could be sold for more than 200,000, and according to his idea, it would be enough to find a wife to live comfortably. But that's still not enough. During this war, it would be best to get some foreign cloth to make two fancy quilt covers and make some money..."

　　At 11 p.m., the battle began. He was with the forward command post. As soon as he heard the loud sound of grenades and machine guns, he immediately gritted his teeth and lay on the ground, afraid to move. He felt that every bullet was at most half a finger away from his skull. He felt particularly scared to work at the front this time, but even under such intense gunfire, the gold ring in his mind was not shaken off.

　　At the same time, the comrades saw that he was very timid and joked with him, but he muttered to everyone, "I'm in terrible shape, why does my stomach hurt so badly!"

　　In this battle, everyone was actively performing meritorious service for the people. What about him? He performed very poorly, always looking for opportunities to make some money. Many comrades asked him, "Yin Zhu! Do you have a burden on your mind now? Why is your morale so low?"

　　"Alas! You don't know that my main problem now is my health. Years of revolution have ruined my health. I now want to ask the higher-ups to transfer me to a different job. Factory work, store work, anything is fine, or I'll have to go to the hospital for a period of convalescence."

　　Yin Zhu didn't feel at ease after returning from the front and was often seen sleeping. His work morale was low. Section Chief × asked him, why are you so unhappy recently? He said: "Alas! My brain disease has been serious these days, I can't sleep at night, and I'm too weak to perform meritorious service." As he spoke, he wrinkled his face, making him look particularly painful.

　　In May, the direct subordinate unit held a merit-establishment and discipline-rectification conference, and he also participated. Seeing how glorious it was for many comrades who were with him to become models and receive commendations and rewards from the conference, he immediately thought of himself. He had been a model in the past, but today he had fallen behind. Not only had he not performed any meritorious service, but he was also planning to leave the army in his mind...

　　Thinking about it like this, he was very painful. At the same time, he also saw with his own eyes that the incorrigible corrupt criminal Fan Guowei was severely punished. He believed that although his personal bad thoughts were not as serious as Fan Guowei's, he always felt that if the gold ring could not be handled correctly, and if corrupt thoughts continued to develop, it would be equally dangerous. The more he thought about it, the more frightened he became.

　　During the two days of the conference, he kept his head down, as if he had done something shameful, and didn't talk to the comrades at all. He was engaged in a fierce struggle in his mind, constantly examining his own thoughts.

　　After the conference, the direct subordinate team launched a check-wind and pursue-merit campaign. In his merit-establishment mutual aid group, several comrades bravely revealed their wrong thoughts, confessed their dirty things to the Party, and resolved to make progress. They moved the comrades in the group to tears, making it difficult for everyone to speak for a long time.

　　At this time, Yin Zhu felt even more sad. He slapped the table and said painfully: "My lack of progress during this period and my gradual drift towards corruption is because my father secretly gave me a gold ring that harmed me. In the past, my thoughts were very pure. Since I had this thing, I have been burdened in my mind, only thinking about marrying a wife and not wanting to work anymore, and afraid to fight in the war. After the secretary's several talks with me and the comrades' help, I now understand that the gold ring is not my treasure, and my first life is my political future. ..."

　　After he finished speaking, he took out the gold ring with trembling hands, and said in a tone as if he were judging a traitor: "Hand it over to the organization." He felt as light and happy as if a thousand-pound stone had been removed from his body. In less than two weeks, his name appeared in the merit-establishment report.

    金戒指与包袱
    查风追功运动中的故事
    田作良
    ×银柱同志，去年九月间，请假回了一趟家。那时村里的群众，正在和他父亲算帐，他回去只住了一夜，第二天就往回返；临走时，父亲暗地里把群众未算走的一个七钱重的金戒指，给了他，并嘱咐他：“可要藏好，等没钱花的时候……”
    他拿上金戒指，象得了传家贵宝的一样，高兴的了不得，装在那里也怕丢了，一路上一直把金戒指紧紧地握在手里，才较放心。
    回来后，不愿意叫同志们知道，他从家里拿来了金戒指。但又没有个好藏处：包在包袱里，怕别人给偷去；装在身上的口袋里，又怕口袋破了会丢掉；想来想去，觉的还是藏在自己贴身衣服的小兜儿里，比较保险。他每天工作学习中，都忘不了这件宝贝，并不断偷偷地摸他的小口袋，隔一会儿不用手摸一摸，总觉的象丢掉了似的，他的脑子简直被这个金戒指占有了。
    一次，天还不大明，他在睡梦中，忽然大喊道：
    “呀！谁把我口袋里的金戒指偷跑了？”当时屋内的同志们都被惊醒，有的同志就马上爬起来问他：“你什么时候丢了的？”这样问了他好几句，他并没吭声，仍在呼呼的睡着，后来大家才知道他是说梦话。
    在起床时，大家一面穿衣服一面和他开玩笑说：
    “银柱！你有几个金戒指，应该向大家坦白，坦白？”这样一问，他以为别人偷去了他的宝贝，急的几乎要跳起来，脸马上红了，顾不上回答大家，赶快悄悄的用手摸他的小口袋，一摸金戒指，仍在自己口袋里，这才又放心，转变了惊慌的神色，对大家说：“我穷的要死，还能有了金戒指！”
    “这是你刚才自己说梦话暴露的秘密呀！”大家故意逗他，但他多次的解释说：“说梦话还能成了事实！”最后哈哈的一笑，就算过去了。
    他虽口头上这样解释，但心里总是怀疑，大家可能发现了他的宝贝，思想上又背了个包袱，因此在日常生活中，他就提高了警惕性，并随时注意着别人的眼色。尤其是大家在一块扯起每个人的家当问题时，他把自己形容的象乞丐一样的穷。
    ××战斗时，上级让他下团帮助工作，第二天就出发。他从接受了这个任务，心就不安了，连饭也不想吃了，一个人低着头，一直在地上走来走去，非常苦闷，但又不能说出来。
    “我这次到前方，如果不幸牺牲了，金戒指呢……？如交给知己同志保存起来，那么他要是丢了呢……？让老乡藏起来吧，更不可靠……？这次不去前方吧，影响一定很坏，况且自己又是革命同志，还能因为一个金戒指……？”
    这样一连串的问题使他很难选出一个最好的处理办法，一夜也未睡着觉。鸡叫时才下了决心，还是叫老侯同志保管起来好；因为老侯和他私人感情较好，同时身上有点病，也不能下到其他地方去工作。
    天还不大亮，他一个人早早地就起了床，把行李打好后，就把老侯悄悄地叫到外面，低声的说：
    “有件事，你可要给我保守秘密，如果我这次到前方牺牲了，这个金戒指你用吧！千万小心，不敢丢掉！”
    老侯接住金戒指，想看一看是个啥样儿。可是一直剥了十多层纸，才算露了面，看了一眼，老侯赶快又包好，装进了里面衫子的口袋里。银柱还是不能放心，就跑到老乡家拿来了针线，把老侯的口袋给缝起来，老侯看他真是一个小心人，笑着对他说：“银柱！不必担心，到前方好好为民立功吧！我一定给你掉不了”。
    早饭后，他就出发了，一路上还是想着他的金戒指，他这样计划：金戒指能卖二十多万，按照他的想法，找个老婆也够舒服了，不过这也还不算多，这次战争中，最好能搞些洋布搞两个花儿被面子，发点洋财才好……”
    晚十一点时，战斗开始了，他和前方指挥所在一起，一听到手榴弹和机枪的巨烈响声，马上咬着牙关爬在地上动也不敢动，觉着每一颗子弹距离他的脑壳顶多有半指远，他感到这次到前方工作，心里特别害怕，但就在这样紧张的炮火下也没有震掉了他脑子里的金戒指。
    同时同志们看见他非常胆小，就和他开玩笑，但他喃喃的对大家说：“我糟糕的很，怎么肚子疼的这样厉害呀！”
    在这次战斗中，大家都在积极为民立功，他呢！表现的很不好，总是想瞅空子发些洋财，好多同志都问他：“银柱！你现在思想上有包袱吗？怎么情绪这样不高？”
    “唉！你们不知道我现在主要是身体问题。革命几年来把身体搞坏了，我现在想要求上级给我调换一下工作，工厂工作、商店工作，都行，要不我也得到医院休养一个时期再说。
    银柱从前方回来后一切不安心，常常见他好睡觉，工作情绪低，×科长问他，你最近为什么这样不高兴？他说：“唉！这几天我的脑病严重，晚上也失眠，身体太弱无法立功。”说着，又把脸皱起来，叫人看着他似乎特别痛苦。
    五月间，分直召开立功整纪大会，他也参加了。看到了好多和他在一块的同志当了模范，受到大会表扬和奖励，有多么光荣，马上连想到个人，过去也当过模范，今天呢！自己落了后，不但没有立下功，而且在思想上，还计划脱离部队。……”
    这样想来想去自己非常痛苦，同时在会上他也亲眼看见执迷不悟的贪污大犯樊国威受到严惩，他认为个人的不良思想，虽没有樊国威的那样严重，但总感到金戒指如不能正确的处理，让腐化思想继续发展下去，同样很危险，他越想越害怕起来。
    连两天的大会上，他一个人尽管低着头，象做下什么丢人事似的，也不和同志们谈一句话，脑子里展开了激烈的斗争，一直在检查着自己的思想。
    大会后，直属队就开展了查风追功运动，在他的这个立功互助组里，有几个同志都勇敢的揭露了自己的错误思想，向党坦白了个人的脏东西决心进步，并把小组的同志，感动的都哭起来了，使大家好大一会说不出话来。
    这时银柱心里更加难过，他拍了一下桌子沉痛的说：我这个时期思想的不进步逐渐走向腐化的道路，就是因为我父亲悄悄给了我一个金戒指害了我，过去我思想是很纯洁的，自从有了这个东西，思想上便背了包袱，光想娶老婆工作也不想做了，仗也不敢打了，经过支书对我的几次谈话，同志们对我的帮助，我现在想通了，金戒指不是我的宝贝，而我的第一生命是政治前途。……
    他说完了话，用战抖着的手，掏出了那个金戒指，用象审判汉奸似的口吻说：“把它交给组织吧。”他身上象去掉一块千斤石样的轻松而愉快了，没有两个礼拜，立功报上便出现了他的名字。
