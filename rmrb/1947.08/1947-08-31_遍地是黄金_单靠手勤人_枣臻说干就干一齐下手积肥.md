Gold Everywhere
　　Just Depends on Diligent People
　　Zaozhen Says Do It and Everyone Starts Accumulating Manure Together
　　[Reported by this newspaper from Lucheng] In Zaozhen Village, Fourth District, an expanded mobilization meeting for accumulating manure for wheat fields was held. 294 men, women, and children attended. The goal of expanding wheat fields to 60-70% was proposed, but the masses lacked confidence. For example, farmer Zhang Fugou said, "Expanding the wheat fields by such a large amount is probably impossible." Han Helin said, "If we plant so much wheat, where will we get the manure!" Yongxing said, "If wheat fields increase, wheat seeds will also be a problem!" In response to this situation, the leadership pointed out the current autumn situation in the village, estimating that after paying public grain, they would still be short by one-third of their food for the year. They also mentioned the disaster situation in Songlin West, a nearby village, which made everyone vigilant. Then, group discussions were held. Chang Wenlong said, "Expanding wheat fields requires accumulating manure first. Collecting manure is like collecting grain, increasing production to overcome disasters. Gold is everywhere, just waiting for diligent people. When visiting relatives in other villages, bring back manure." Textile hero Chen Liunu said, "Women will soon finish most of their textile work, and we will immediately go cut artemisia to accumulate manure." Children's squad leader Chang Changsheng said, "Our children can also cut artemisia, pick up manure, and sweep road soil to accumulate manure. Our slogan is: Broom." Han Tingzhao said, "If there is difficulty with wheat seeds, everyone should help each other out and cooperate. The cooperative will be responsible for coordination." After two days of deliberation and discussion, the enthusiasm of the masses rose sharply. Finally, each brigade made plans to expand wheat fields, increasing the total wheat fields in the village by 150 mu, accumulating 30,000 dan of manure. The elementary school composed a six-paragraph ditty about the movement to expand wheat fields and accumulate manure, teaching children to sing it to encourage the masses' enthusiasm anytime and anywhere. The large-scale manure accumulation movement shook the entire village. For example, the women's group led by Han Dongguo, six people cut 1,400 jin of artemisia in one day. Old man Liu Fuqiu dug more than 200 dan of sod in half a day. According to three days of statistics, 111 women cut 102,000 jin of artemisia, and men cut 16,824 jin of artemisia. 4,399 dan of wasteland was smoked, 2,440 dan of sod was dug, 7,804 dan of wheat manure was accumulated, and 1,210 dan of grass manure was accumulated. The village originally had 67,638 dan of manure. With 40 dan of manure applied per mu, 2,710 mu of wheat land could be fertilized. A seed seller from Xiaochang Village said, "I've been to fourteen villages, and this is the first village where manure accumulation is done so well. Men, women, old and young, are all working with one mind, doing whatever they are told to do. When I return to my village, I will do as Zaozhen does." The village has now scheduled a two-day manure delivery campaign. (Hao Qin, Lusheng, Songlin)
