[Reported from Li Cheng by this newspaper] Labor Hero Shi Cunjin, considering the poor harvests expected for both the summer and autumn seasons this year, believes a famine is imminent. Besides actively leading the masses in weeding seedlings, he also led the masses in discussions to formulate a production plan to overcome the famine, proposing to plant a large amount of wheat this year. He first mobilized the masses, saying, "This year, the first half was dry, and the summer and autumn harvests will be reduced. We need to plant more wheat to provide relief early next year. Everyone has turned over and has land now. Based on past experience, if there is no rain in the first half of the year, there will be sufficient rain in the second half. Moreover, we have irrigation canals that can water the wheat, ensuring a good harvest. Especially since we must prepare for a major counter-offensive, we need to produce more grain!" After his mobilization and discussion, everyone recognized the importance of expanding wheat fields this year and unanimously proposed to plant more wheat. Shi Fengqi said, "In the past, I wanted to plant more wheat but had no land. Now that I've turned over, I must plant several more mu!" Last year, he only planted 1.5 mu of wheat; this year, he plans to plant 5.6 mu. According to statistics from the village's three teams, they plan to increase wheat fields by a total of 123.7 mu, exceeding 20% of the total wheat land in the village last year. Finally, Shi Cunjin also proposed, "We must not only expand wheat fields but also increase fertilizer." He proposed that he would apply an average of 50 *tuo* of fertilizer per mu this year. After further discussion, the whole village agreed to apply an average of 40 *tuo* of fertilizer per mu this year. Besides the existing fertilizer, they will organize the cutting of *hao* grass in large quantities to compost, followed by sweeping sheep manure, sweeping road soil, hauling silt, digging stove soil, dredging river sediment, and smoking cypress oil. Currently, besides a few people continuing to weed seedlings and finish up, most have started cutting *hao* grass to accumulate fertilizer. (Li Min, Jing Guo)

[Reported by our newspaper reporter group on the 21st] In order to summarize this year's production achievements and lay the foundation for next year's large-scale production campaign, the Xingtai County Committee has called on the entire county to launch a "compare crops, compare techniques" campaign. The county committee first studied last year's production summary, finding that it failed to adequately summarize issues such as "deep plowing and meticulous cultivation," "mutual aid," and "applying more fertilizer," and mostly pursued numbers. This year, the summary should focus on the "compare crops" and "compare techniques" aspects of increasing production. The main content of the call: (1) Compare crops and techniques, focusing on the differences between dibbling and dry planting, early planting and late planting, mutual aid and non-mutual aid, topdressing and no topdressing, heavily weeded and lightly weeded, and planting after plowing and planting on stubble. (2) Specific methods: First, select representatives from the groups for evaluation, gradually expanding to comparisons between individuals, groups, villages, and points (a point including several villages), to summarize this year's production campaign. According to the county committee, this summary method truly embodies the mass line. Its advantage is that it universally selects models, summarizes various experiences, and profoundly educates the peasants through the "compare crops" and "compare techniques" campaign. It will lay a solid ideological foundation for next year's labor mutual aid production campaign in terms of mutual aid, dibbling, fertilization, deep plowing, and meticulous cultivation. (Zhu Bo)

[Reported by our newspaper reporter group on the 20th] In order to remedy the poor harvest caused by drought this year, Xingtai County conducted a county-wide topdressing and yield-increasing campaign. Li Qingyuan (Labor Hero), the village chief of the old district of Lishui Village, when he initially raised the issue of topdressing and yield increase at the production meeting, many peasants could not understand it, saying, "More fertilizer when it rains," "More weeding when it's dry," "Topdressing during a drought is like adding fuel to the fire, it will dry out even faster!" The issue of topdressing sparked a heated debate among the peasants. Li Shijie, remembering that the Golden Queen corn he planted last year grew better than others simply because he applied a little more fertilizer, believed that the government's topdressing method was correct. So he said to everyone, "The Golden Queen I planted last year grew better than others just because I applied a little more fertilizer. If we apply some topdressing, think about how much we can harvest. Besides, our soil here is sandy, and the more fertilizer we apply, the better the crops will grow!" Li Qingliang also used the harvest from his 1.8 mu of land as an example to persuade everyone, saying, "In the past, I used very little thin manure to water my 1.8 mu of land to help the seedlings grow, and it was always better than anyone else's crops. If we apply topdressing this year, the harvest will definitely be better." Before he could finish, some peasants started arguing. "That's right! Qingliang's land isn't necessarily good, but his harvest is always more than ours!" After this debate, most peasants understood the idea, but a few still couldn't grasp it. Li Guangcong said, "I'm saving money to buy grain to eat. If I use the money to buy fertilizer, I'll be even worse off if there's a drought!" As a result, many people applied topdressing, while some did not. In order to further clarify everyone's thinking, the village leadership launched a crop comparison campaign, with peasants commenting on the quality of crops in the fields in groups of two or three. Some said, "Li Qingliang's 1.8 mu of millet has 'grabbed' it again!" Li Shiyin's 2.5 mu has also "grabbed" it (meaning to get rich). We've been saying all these years, has there ever been a government method that didn't work?" Li Qingliang's 1.8 mu of millet had 164 *jin* of cake applied, growing as tall as a person's shoulder, and the millet ears were all "bird-spinning" (meaning the stalks were bending under the weight of the millet ears). Experienced peasants said, "This 1.8 mu of millet will harvest at least 2 *shi* and 8 *dou*." The Golden Queen corn planted by Li Shinian was thicker than two of other people's plants. Each plant had at least three ears. They tested it on the spot: four ears could yield one *sheng*, and each *mu* could harvest 3 *da shi*. Li Shiyin applied topdressing four times to his indigo per *mu*, and it grew to completely cover the ground. Each *mu* could harvest 90 to 100 *jin* (the general harvest is about 60 *jin*). At the lowest price of 3,000 yuan per *jin*, each *mu* could earn 90,000 yuan more from the extra 30 *jin*. At first, people just talked about it, but after seeing that those who applied topdressing had all "grabbed" it, the peasants who hadn't applied topdressing, seeing that their crops were growing much worse than others, all regretted it: "I shouldn't have listened to the village chief!" Now, Li Guangcong, seeing his millet seedlings yellow, could only sigh and complain to others, "I didn't listen to the advice before, and now the harvest will be much less. Alas! It's really too late to regret it. See you next year!" (Zhu Bo)

　　劳英石寸金领导全村
  　增加肥料扩大麦田
    邢台提出比庄稼比技术评选生产模范
    【本报黎城讯】劳英石寸金根据今年年景，夏秋两季都歉收，认为灾荒已造就，除积极领导群众锄苗外，又领导群众讨论，订生产渡荒计划，提出今年要大量种麦。他首先在群众中动员，向大家说：“今年前半年天旱，夏秋两季收成都减少，咱们要多种麦子，明年早接济；大家都翻身有了土地，根据历年经验，前半年没雨，后半年雨水不缺，再则咱们有水渠，能浇种麦子，收成一定不坏，特别是咱们要准备大反攻，更要多生产粮食才行！”他动员后，经过讨论，大家认识了今年扩大麦田的重要意义，一致提出要多种麦子。石逢歧说：“过去咱就想多种点麦子也没有地，现在翻了身啦，可得多种几亩！”去年他只种一亩半麦，今年要种五亩六分。按全村三个队的统计，计划共增加麦田一百二十三亩七分，超过去年全村麦地总数百分之二十。最后，石寸金又提出：“咱们不但要扩大麦田，还要增加肥料。”他提出他今年每亩地要平均上肥五十亩。又经过大家讨论，全村每亩地今年都要平均上肥四十驮，除现有肥料外，不足数大量组织割蒿沤肥，其次是扫羊粪、扫道土、挑污土、打炕土、捞河渣、薰柏油。现各队除少数人继续锄苗扫尾巴，大部已开始割蒿积肥。（立民、靖国）
    【本报记者团二十一日电】为总结今年生产成绩，给明年的大生产运动打下基础。邢台县委会号召全县开展一个“比庄稼、比技术”运动。该县县委会首先研究了去年的生产总结，发现未能很好的从“深耕细作”、“互助起来”、“多上肥料”等问题上来总结，多是追求数字，今年应从“比庄稼”、“比技术”来总结增产问题。该号召主要内容：（一）“比庄稼”、“比技术”以点种与旱种的，早种与晚种的，互助与不互助的，追肥与不追肥的，普遍多的与锄遍少的，犁后下种与贴茬种的对比。（二）具体做法：先从小组选出代表，进行评判，逐渐发展到人与人，组与组对比，村与村，点与点（一点数个村庄）对比，从中来总结今年的生产运动。据该县县委谈称，此种总结方式是真正群众路线，它的好处是从“比庄稼”、“比技术”运动中，普遍挑选模范，总结各种经验，普遍的对农民深刻的作一次教育。在互助上，点种上，施肥上，深耕细作上，给明年的劳动互助生产运动在思想上奠定稳固的基础。（朱波）
    【本报记者团二十日电】邢台县为了补救今年天旱歉收，曾在全县进行了一次追肥增产运动。老区黎水村村长李庆元（劳动英雄），在生产会上开始提出了追肥增产问题时，好多农民都打不通思想，都说：“雨多多上粪”，“天旱多锄苗”，“天旱上追肥，等于火上加油，旱死的更快点！”上追肥问题，在农民中展开了热烈的争论，李世杰想到去年自己种的金皇后玉茭仅仅多上了一点粪，长的就比别人好，他认为政府给想的追肥办法是对的。于是就对大家说：“我去年种的金皇后，只多上了一点粪，长的就比别人好，如果上点追肥，你们想想能打多少。再说咱们这里地都是沙性的，肥料上得愈多，庄稼长得愈好！”李庆亮也以自己一亩八分地的收成做例子，来说服大家，他说：“我那一亩八分地，过去都是用很少的汤粪浇了浇，将苗烘起来，就比谁的庄稼都好，今年要是上追肥，收成一定会更好。”有一些农民未等他说完，都吵起来了。“对呀！庆亮的地板并不见得好，可是收的总比咱的多！”经过这场争论后，大部农民打通了思想，只有少数农民思想仍打不通。李光聪说：“我留着钱还买粮食吃哩，要把钱买了粪，天旱了更没办法啦！”结果有许多人上了追肥，有些人就是不上。村领导上为了进一步打通大家的思想，目前展开了一个比庄稼运动，农民们三三两两到地里评论庄稼的好坏。有的说：“李庆亮那一亩八分谷子又‘抓了’！李士银的二亩半也“抓了”（发财的意思），咱说这些年来政府想的办法那里有不行过？”李庆亮的一亩八分谷上了一百六十四斤饼，长的和人肩膀齐，谷穗子都“鸟旋”（谷穗重的杆子支持不住都弯下来的意思）。有经验的农民说：“这一亩八分谷子，最少要收二石八斗。”李士年种的金皇后，一棵赶上别人两棵粗。每棵最少长三个穗子，他们当场试验，四个穗子可打一升，每亩能收三大石。李士银种的靛，每亩上追肥四次，长的完全盖满地皮，每亩能收九十斤至一百斤（一般的收六十斤左右），每斤按最低价钱三千元计，每亩多收三十斤可多卖九万元。开始光说不算，亲自看见上追肥的都“抓了”，没有上追肥的农民，看着自己的庄稼长的比别人差劲多了，都后悔：“可不该不听村长的话！”李光聪现在看着自己的谷苗黄黄的，光唉声叹气，对别人说：“头里不听劝，现在庄稼可少收多了，唉！真是后悔也晚了，明年见吧！”（朱波）
