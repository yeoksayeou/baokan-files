　　The "Overturning the body requires overturning the mind, thoroughly exposing air-raid shelters, and voluntary reporting meritorious service campaign" has been widely launched in the Dong'a Second District. In Caotun Village, a village-wide mass meeting was held on the 25th of last month to discuss how to expose "air-raid shelters" and thoroughly investigate landlords. The head of the peasant association spoke first: "Those of us who are basic masses who are hiding things for landlords should quickly take them out. Anyone who hides them and doesn't take them out is taking the landlord line." The masses listened, staring blankly, afraid to say anything. Some expressed panic, while others just lowered their heads and smoked, the atmosphere was very dull. District cadres, seeing that the masses were intimidated, consulted with village cadres to change their attitude and re-emphasized to the masses: We hid things for the landlords because we were fooled by the landlords. The landlords used kinship and old feudal relationships to deceive us. Today, we are overturning bodies and minds, and anything we are hiding for the landlords should be voluntarily reported. Only then can we truly overturn ourselves. The leadership also sincerely stated: "We will not force anyone to report, but those who voluntarily report will be praised and credited." With this enlightenment, the masses began to struggle internally. Then, four peasant association members reported 1,200 catties of wheat, fifty bundles, and three crates, and reflected: "We have overturned ourselves, but we are still hiding things for the landlords. Thinking about it, we are really letting Chairman Mao down!" This was met with enthusiastic applause and support from the masses. District Chief Guo praised them on the spot and called on everyone hiding things for the landlords to learn from them. The District Committee discovered this new creation of exposing air-raid shelters and wrote a notice overnight. The next day, blackboards in all villages in the district posted this message. Zhao Lou Village adopted this experience, and 52 out of 105 households in the village voluntarily reported the landlord's "air-raid shelters." Peasant Association member Li Changtai alone reported 41 single garments and two quilts. Wang Jing Village launched voluntary reporting of meritorious service. Zhang Jianzhao, a consistently backward peasant, took the lead in reporting hiding 400 catties of wheat, 100 catties of cotton, and 200 catties of fine food for the landlord. The masses immediately discussed and credited him with one meritorious service. Currently, the voluntary reporting of meritorious service campaign to overturn bodies and minds is widely underway in all villages in the district.

　　东阿二区启发落后农民
  　翻身翻心自报防空洞
    【本报冀鲁豫二十二日电】东阿二区“翻身要翻心，彻底挑掉防空洞，自报立功运动”广泛展开。曹屯村于上月二十五日开全村群众大会，讨论如何挑掉“防空洞”彻底清查地主，农会长首先讲话：“咱们基本群众谁藏地主的东西赶快拿出来，谁要藏着不拿就是地主路线”。群众听了都瞪着眼不敢吭气，有的表示恐慌，有的光低着头吸烟，非常沉闷。区干看看群众被吓住了，便和村干商量转变态度，重新向群众表示：咱藏地主东西，是上了地主的当，地主利用亲戚本家封建旧关系，来欺哄了咱，咱今天翻身要翻心，凡家里藏着地主的东西都该自报出来，咱翻身才算翻到头。领导上并恳切声明：“不报也不逼，自报的一定要表扬和记功”。这样一启发，群众心里斗争起来了。接着就有四个农会员报出了一千二百斤麦子、五十个包袱、三个板箱；并反省说：“咱翻身啦，还藏着地主的东西，回想起来真对不起毛主席！”博得群众热烈鼓掌拥护。郭区长当场表扬，并号召凡家里藏地主的东西，都应向他们学习。区分委会发现这一挑防空洞的新创造，连夜写通知，第二天全区各村黑板报都登了这一个消息，赵楼村接受了这一经验，全村一百零五户就有五十二户自动报出了地主的“防空洞”。农会员李常太一人，就报出单衣四十一件，被子两床。王井村展开自报立功，一贯落后的农民张建兆，带头报出隐藏地主的四百斤麦子、一百斤棉花、二百斤细食，群众当即评议给他记功一次。现下翻身翻心的自报立功运动在全区各村广泛展开。
