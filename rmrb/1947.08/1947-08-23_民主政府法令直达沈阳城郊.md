Xinhua News Agency, Northeast, 21st—The democratic government persists in the Shen(yang)-Fu(shun)-Tie(ling) area, establishing a joint county in the region. Its decrees extend to the suburbs of Shenyang and Fushun. The masses in various places actively participate in land reform. For example, in Dalin Village, Joint County, 69 landless and land-poor peasant households recovered 1,407 mu of land from the despotic landlord Teng Yonghuai. Among them, 19 extremely poor peasant households also received 26 houses, 36 shi of grain, and 15 livestock. After the struggle, a democratic village government was immediately established, determined to fight to the end against the Chiang bandits and feudal forces.

    【新华社东北二十一日电】民主政府坚持在沈（阳）抚（顺）铁（岭）地区，在该地设联合县，其法令推行达沈阳及抚顺城郊。各地群众积极参加土地改革，如联合县之大林村，六十九户无地少地农民，即从恶霸地主滕永怀手里追回土地一千四百零七亩，其中十九户赤贫农民并分得房子二十六间，粮食三十六石，牲口十五头。斗争后当即成立民主村政权，坚决同蒋贼及封建势力斗争到底。
