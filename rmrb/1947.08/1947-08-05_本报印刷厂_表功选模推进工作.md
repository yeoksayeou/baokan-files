    The Newspaper Printing Plant
    Commends Achievement and Selects Model Workers to Promote Work
    [Our Newspaper] The newspaper printing plant summarized its work in late July and launched a commendation and model worker selection campaign. First, the typesetting room, engraving room, plate-making room, administrative office, engineering section, etc., conducted evaluations and competitions by unit, and then all employees of the plant reviewed and elected a total of eighteen model workers, twelve first-class, and three each for second and third class. Thanks to their exemplary role, the entire plant not only completed the newspaper's printing and typesetting tasks but also processed and printed reference materials, propaganda materials, People's Warrior, military and government correspondence, and books. When busy, they worked through Sundays and holidays, sometimes automatically increasing their eight-hour workday to twelve hours or more, and even working at night when necessary. They exhausted all means to make the layout beautiful and legible, and the typeface clear. For example, comrades Zhou Jinglong, Liu Qizhi, and Yang Wengui from the typesetting room studied patterns when imposing pages to make the layout lively and clear. Comrade Song Tingwen from the engraving room led four apprentices and engraved various fonts very beautifully. The achievements and work style of these model workers were praised and rewarded at the meeting. (Shao Dazhang)

    本报印刷厂
    表功选模推进工作
    【本报讯】本报印刷厂于七月下旬总结工作，开展表功选模运动。首由排字房、刻字房、打版房、事务处、工务股………等为单位评议竞选，又经全厂职工审查、选举，共选出工作模范十八名，甲等十二名、乙丙各三名。全厂由于他们的模范带头作用，不仅完成了本报印刷、排字等任务，还加工排印了参考资料、宣传品、人民战士、军政往来，及书籍等………。忙时他们不过礼拜，有时且由八小时工作自动增加到十二小时以上，必要时夜里还干。他们用尽一切办法求得版面美丽好看、字迹清楚。如排字房工友周景龙、刘棋枝、杨文贵等同志，拚版时研究花样，使版面活泼清晰，刻字房宋廷文同志一人带领了四个练习生，各种字体刻的很美观。这些模范的成绩与作风，在会上都受到了表扬与奖励。（邵大章）
