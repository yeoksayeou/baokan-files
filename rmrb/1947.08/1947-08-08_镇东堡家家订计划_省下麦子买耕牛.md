(This article was transmitted by our Jinnan correspondent on the 6th) Zhen Dong Fort Village, Qiu County, was discussing how to increase production when the village head, Wang Zunyan, made a calculation: the whole village only has forty-two oxen. Because there are so few oxen, the plowing is shallow and the grass roots are not removed, only one plowing can be done, and fertilizer cannot be accumulated. Everyone knows this principle, but why hasn't the number of oxen increased? Wang Yunxia said: "I could have bought half an ox, but I was afraid of another disaster, so I didn't buy it." Because the whole village only has small sprouts and no large sprouts this year, this mood is very common. Village head Wang Zunyan saw this and said: "It is not a solution to lie down in the face of disaster. We must practice strict economy, save three bags of wheat, and spin fifty catties of low-quality cotton to weave into cloth bags, which can buy half an ox." Wang Yunxia said: "I will also take two bags of wheat and sell fifty catties of good cotton to buy half an ox." After the meeting, the Farmers' Association Director Wang Hongyuan called on all members of the village to "learn from the village head and Wang Yunxia, save wheat to buy oxen!" All one hundred and fifty households in the village are making plans to buy forty oxen with the things they save before the fifteenth day of the seventh lunar month.

    镇东堡家家订计划
    省下麦子买耕牛
    【本报冀南六日电】邱县镇东堡村研究怎样增产时，村长王尊彦作了个统计，全村只有四十二头牛，因为牛少，耕得浅犁不掉草根，只能犁一遍，又不能积肥，地不壮收成小，大家也知道这个道理，为啥耕牛一直没有增加呢？王云霞说：“我本来能买半个牛，怕再来个灾荒，就不买了”。因为全村今年只有小苗没大苗，这种情绪很普遍，村长王尊彦看到了便说：“在灾荒面前躺倒不是个法，俺要厉行节约，省下三布袋麦，还有五十斤孬花纺起织成布袋，能买半头牛”。王云霞说：“我也要拿二布袋麦和五十斤好花卖了，买半头牛。”开罢会，农会主任王洪远号召全村会员群众“向村长和王云霞看齐，省下麦子买耕牛”！全村一百五十户人家，家家订计划，要在阴历七月十五日以前，以节约的东西买耕牛四十头。
