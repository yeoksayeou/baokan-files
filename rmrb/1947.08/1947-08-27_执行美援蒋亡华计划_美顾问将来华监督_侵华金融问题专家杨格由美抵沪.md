Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 25th. Wedemeyer left Nanjing for Japan on the morning of the 24th. Sources confirm that Chiang and the US have reached an agreement on the matter of hiring US advisors to come to China to supervise the administrative affairs of the Chiang government. United Press and Associated Press reported on the 23rd that Wedemeyer's mission spokesman admitted that the Chiang government had submitted suggestions for hiring various American advisors. Chiang Kai-shek even requested Wedemeyer himself to be his military advisor, tempting him with generous salaries, but Wei refused because Wei "is also a valuable figure in his own country" (Associated Press). A Reuters report on the 23rd quoted a semi-official Shanghai source as saying that Wedemeyer's visit to China was to implement the plan to aid Chiang and destroy China, in order to adapt to the US imperialist world aggression policy: "The United States is engaged in an expansion policy, and the US government wants to lead a 'orderly' world, a world that can buy American goods and pay for them, and that can have American desires. The problem of making China suitable for this plan requires more ingenuity and sophistication than all other problems combined."

Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 25th. According to a statement by the Chiang government's Executive Yuan Information Bureau on the 24th, American financial expert Arthur N. Young arrived in Shanghai from the US on the 22nd. It is said that Young was invited by the Chiang government to serve as a "consultant" to the recently established Central Bank Foreign Exchange Stabilization Fund Committee, and as a "consultant" on other financial and monetary "current issues." This fully confirms that the new foreign exchange and trade system recently promulgated by the Chiang government is purely to adapt to the interests of US imperialism's economic aggression against China, and it also confirms that the US imperialist plan to comprehensively supervise and control all departments of the Chiang government with "advisors" and "experts" is being actively implemented. According to a United Press report from Nanjing on the 23rd, the Chiang government submitted a final report to Wei before Wedemeyer left China, "the content of which is a comprehensive review of the Chinese tax system that often plagues American businessmen," This shows that Chiang Kai-shek is planning to revise the tariff and other tax systems, so that China will be completely turned into a colonial market for the United States, as a "gift" to Wedemeyer's farewell.

　　执行美援蒋亡华计划
  　美顾问将来华监督
    侵华金融问题专家杨格由美抵沪
    【新华社陕北二十五日电】魏德迈已于二十四日上午离开南京飞往日本。各方消息证实，蒋美两方关于聘请美国顾问来华监督蒋政府行政事务一事，已取得协议。合众社及美联社二十三日消息称：魏德迈使团发言人承认蒋政府送来聘请各种美国顾问的建议。蒋介石甚至请求魏德迈本人作他的军事顾问，并以优厚的薪俸相诱惑，但魏拒绝了，因为魏“在他本国也是一个宝贵的人物”（美联社）。路透社二十三日消息引述上海半官方人士的谈话，证实魏德迈的来华，是为了执行援蒋亡华，以适应美帝国主义世界侵略政策之预定计划：“美国正从事于扩张政策，美国政府想要领导‘有秩序的’世界，这世界能买美国货并付钱，并能具有美国的愿望。使中国适于这个计划的问题，比其他一切问题总和起来，都需要更加机敏和圆滑”。
    【新华社陕北二十五日电】据蒋政府行政院新闻局二十四日宣布：美国金融问题专家阿瑟·Ｎ·杨格已于二十二日由美抵沪。据称：杨系应蒋政府邀请，来华担任最近设置之中央银行外汇平衡基金委员会“顾问”，并作为其他财政金融“当前各项问题”的“顾问”。此事完全证实蒋政府最近颁布的新外汇及贸易制度，纯为适应美帝国主义经济侵华之利益，此事亦证实美帝国主义以“顾问”及“专家”全面监督及控制蒋政府各部门之亡华计划，已在积极实行中。另据合众社二十三日南京电：蒋政府已于魏德迈离华前，向魏提交最后一份报告，“内容是综合的检讨时常使美国商人头痛的中国捐税制度”，此显示蒋介石正计划修改关税及其他税收制度，使中国彻底变成美国的殖民地市场，以此作为给魏德迈送行的“礼物”。
