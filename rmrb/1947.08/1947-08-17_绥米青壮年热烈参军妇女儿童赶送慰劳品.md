Xinhua News Agency, Northwest, 15th. More than 1,300 volunteers from Suide and Mizhi counties in the Shaanxi-Gansu-Ningxia Border Region are about to join the army in a grand ceremony and go to the front lines to kill enemies and make meritorious service. Among them are 298 cadres and party members. Since late June, under the leadership of cadres and Communist Party members taking the lead in joining the army, the two counties developed into a widespread mass army enlistment movement by the end of July. Young people enthusiastically signed up, competing to join the People's Liberation Army and make meritorious service as an honor. Various places have exceeded their tasks. In Jizhen District of Suide, as of the 29th of last month, 207 people had voluntarily joined the army, exceeding the quota by 37. All the army personnel in the district jointly sent a letter to Chairman Lin Boqu of the Border Government, expressing their determination to kill the enemy, take revenge, and make meritorious service for the people, which has been commended by Chairmen Lin, Li, Liu, and Zheng. Currently, the army personnel in the two counties are inviting relatives and friends to join the army, while stepping up production to settle family affairs. Their families are also busy making clothes and shoes for their husbands and sons. Local township governments have successively held glorious army enlistment conferences, rewarding and encouraging army personnel, and issuing glorious army enlistment certificates. Women and children are even more excitedly rushing to make comfort goods, preparing to send them off. In Deyihe Emeizui Village, eleven women have already completed more than 120 pieces.
Xinhua News Agency, Northwest, 15th. A record of Jiang's army's atrocities in northern Shaanxi: (1) Zhao Qinzhang, a teacher at the Second Primary School in Qiuyu Gou, Zichang County, was arrested by Jiang's army and severely tortured to extract information about the guerrillas. Zhao remained unyielding and did not utter a word. Jiang's army stripped Zhao naked, tied him to a tree, and let loose vicious dogs to bite him. His whole body was exposed to the bone, and his flesh was a bloody mess. Jiang's army even used bayonets to cut open Zhao's abdomen, dig out his intestines and liver, and fill them with dung and grass. (2) Jiang's army, which rampaged through the Sixth Township of Peijiagou District, Zizhou County, forced farmers to dig cave dwellings. Because the cliff collapsed, twenty-two farmers were all buried in the kiln. Jiang's army clapped their hands and cheered, "Buried well, buried well." Nearby people rushed to rescue them, but were stopped by Jiang's army firing guns.
