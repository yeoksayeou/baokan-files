　　Our Army in Northern Henan Continues to Attack
  　The Enemy in Xiuwu and Jiaozuo are Extremely Panicked
    [Our Newspaper Taihang, 29th] After the Dao battle, the remnants of the puppets in Xiuwu and Jiaozuo, under the heavy siege of our local armed forces, are extremely panicked. Daiwang Town (west of Xiuwu), which was once occupied by the enemy, was once again recovered by us. On the 3rd of this month, over a hundred enemies invaded Yanmazhuang. More than ten militiamen resisted for an hour and, in coordination with the 77th unit, repelled the enemy. On the 9th, over a hundred enemies again attacked Majie. Cui Jinshan, the village head of the village, led four militiamen and stubbornly persisted for four hours. The enemy gradually increased to seven companies. After the people's local armed forces arrived, they coordinated the attack, annihilating over thirty enemies. Taking advantage of the victory, we approached, and on the 11th, the enemy fled in panic. Our local soldiers and civilians immediately destroyed all the enemy's fortifications in the town. The enemy's transportation between Xiuwu and Jiaozuo was also cut off by us.
    [Another Dispatch] Since the Dao battle, the Xiuwu battalion has actively cooperated with the main force in combat, sweeping away enemy puppets with brilliant results, capturing 103 enemies including Li Leshan, the captain of the Xiuwu Security Regiment, killing and wounding 194 enemies, and capturing 463 puppet self-defense despots, etc. It seized one mortar, one heavy machine gun, seven light machine guns, 195 short guns, more than 27,000 rounds of ammunition, 186 mortar shells, 60 boxes of artillery shells, 30 rifle grenades, 35 war horses, one radio station, four telephones, one radio, and many other resources.
    [Our Newspaper Taihang, 29th] During the Daoqing battle, stretchers from Lucheng and Changzhi in the Second Taihang Military Sub-district, and six stretchers from Lingchuan, Qinyang, Bo'ai, Wenxian, Xiuwu, and Wuzhi in the Fourth Military Sub-district, totaling people, bravely participated in the battle. In addition to successfully completing their tasks, they also cooperated with the troops to capture 102 stubborn puppet despots, obtaining 53 rifles, 7 pistols, 5 head of livestock, and more than 2,000 rounds of ammunition. Under the model influence of the Lucheng, Lingchuan, and Changzhi stretcher teams, the stretcher teams in the new districts of Bo'ai and Wenxian counties also launched the "People Love the People" movement, helping the masses in the new districts with production, hoeing, watering, and well-digging. In addition, the Lingchuan stretcher team also saved and relieved seven impoverished households in Xizhuang Village, Bo'ai, hoeing 592.5 mu of land for the masses, delivering 650 loads of manure, digging two wells, and carrying out propaganda to the masses in the new district anytime and anywhere by writing slogans. In the battle to liberate Bo'ai, the stretcher teams of Lucheng, Changzhi, and Lingchuan counties won the title of "Model for Participating in the War." Wang Baozhu's group of three old men from the Lucheng stretcher team, in the rain of bullets, crossed the moat and climbed the city wall, carrying the "Colored Number" three times in a row. Two people carried one, and one person carried another. Song Xinglie of the Third Brigade snatched five "Colored Numbers" in a row.
