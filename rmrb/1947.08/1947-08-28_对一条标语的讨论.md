　　A discussion in "Everyone's Talk" about a slogan has prompted numerous letters from readers. We welcome everyone's input, but only new opinions will be published. If there's nothing new, we will no longer publish them.

    According to the situation introduced by a certain comrade, it is evident that the slogan "One wealth covers a hundred uglinesses" is believed to have solved the masses' fear of getting rich and the idea that "poor people are not ugly even if they have uglinesses." We believe that this slogan not only fails to solve these two ideological problems but will probably further confuse the masses and lead to more misconceptions. Because becoming wealthy through exploitation and becoming wealthy through labor are fundamentally two different paths. If we use "One wealth covers a hundred uglinesses" to solve the problem of ideological mobilization for production, it is tantamount to admitting that poor people have uglinesses, or that being rich is ugly. Otherwise, why would there be a need to "cover" it up? This is a matter of principle, not someone else's misunderstanding, let alone "nitpicking."
    A slogan is a banner for action. The leadership not only has the responsibility to raise the level from low to high but also should correct misconceptions and guide people towards the right direction. We must never think that everything proposed by the masses is completely wrong or shift the leadership responsibility onto the masses. Finally, a certain comrade said: "This slogan has played a great role in mass production." We believe that there must be other conditions that have contributed to this effect. For the thorough resolution of the problem, we hope that the comrade will conduct further investigation and research, which will be helpful for guiding future work.

    　　　　II.
    After reading "Everyone's Talk" on August 11th and rereading "Everyone's Talk" on July 10th, I feel that the slogan "The poor have become wealthy, one wealth covers a hundred uglinesses" has a grammatical error. I suggest that it not be used in various places. The source of the error lies in the connection between the word "ugliness" and "poor people." Poor people are not ugly; poor people become rich through production, which is even less ugly. Even if someone asks: "Are we poor people ugly?" one should not answer with: "The poor have become wealthy, one wealth covers a hundred uglinesses." Because such an answer implies that the poor were "ugly" in the past, or that "ugliness" can only be covered after becoming rich, which is easily misunderstood. The exploiters and landlords have already monopolized the word "ugliness." Feudal forces stubbornly link "poverty" and "ugliness" together, so the feudal society's view of "poverty" is also "ugly." We must strive to eliminate this kind of consciousness. Since slogans are a guide for action, they should play a guiding role in this matter, raising the masses' correct and clear understanding of poverty and ugliness. We should not accommodate idioms and blur the masses' consciousness. It is best to use positive statements: "Becoming rich through exploitation is an ugly thing, becoming rich through labor is glorious" to increase the enthusiasm for production.
    My understanding of this slogan, both before and after, is: in feudal and semi-feudal societies, it was used to encourage people to become rich by any means necessary. Although the means were shameless, the word "wealth" covered up all ugly things (a hundred uglinesses), emphasizing that the rich have "no" (or are not considered to have) uglinesses. It is inappropriate to forcibly use it as a production mobilization slogan.

### 对一条标语的讨论

专栏：大家谈

　　对一条标语的讨论
    大家谈中研究了一条标语，引起了读者纷纷来信讨论。我们很欢迎大家发言，但必须有新意见，如果没有，也就不再发表了。　　　　　
　　——编者
    　　　　一、
    据某同志的情况介绍显然是以为“一富遮百丑”的标语，解决了群众的“怕富”和“穷人有了丑不丑”的思想。我们认为这条标语不仅解决不了这两个思想问题，恐怕使群众越发糊涂起来更加错觉，因为剥削起家和劳动致富基本上是两条路线，如以“一富遮百丑”来解决思想动员生产，就无异承认了穷人有丑，或富了是丑，不然又何必来“遮”？这是原则上的争论，并不是别人的误会，更不是“钻”。
    标语是行动的标帜，领导上不仅有责任把低级提高到高级，尤应纠正错觉诱向正确，决不能认为群众提出的就完全错误，或将领导责任推在群众身上。最后某同志说：“这条标语在群众生产中起了很大作用”。我们认为起作用的一定有其他条件，为了问题的彻底解决，尚希某同志再调查研究一下，对今后工作指导是有帮助的。（彦庆、袭曾、瑞世、玉林）
    　　　　二、
    读了八月十一日的“大家谈”又翻了一下七月十日的“大家谈”，感到“穷人变成了有，一富遮百丑”这条标语是有语病的，我建议各地不要采用它，其病源在“丑”字与“穷人”的连系上。穷人不丑；穷人富了，生产所致，更不丑。就是有人问：“咱们穷人有了丑不丑？”也不应答以：“穷人变成有，一富遮百丑”。因为这样答法，则好象过去穷人“丑”过，或富了后，“丑”才能遮着似的，很易被人误解。这“丑”字已经被剥削者地主们独占了，封建劳力硬把“穷”与“丑”强拉在一起，所以封建社会对“穷”的看法也就“丑”了。这种意识，我们要努力消除它。标语口号既是行动的指针的，在这件事上就应起其诱导作用，提高群众对穷与丑正确的明确的认识，不应迁就熟语模糊群众的意识，最好用正说明：“剥削发家是丑事，劳动致富才光荣”来提高生产的积极性。
    前后我对这条标语的了解是：封建、半封建社会，用来鼓励人们以不择手段来变成富翁的，虽然手段无耻，恰被“富”字把一切丑事（百丑）遮着了，着重在富人是“没有”（有也不算）丑的。拿来勉强用做生产鼓动口号是不妥当的。
