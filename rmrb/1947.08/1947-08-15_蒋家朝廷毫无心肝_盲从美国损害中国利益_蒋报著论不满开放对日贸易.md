Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 13th. Belated news from Tianjin: The Yishibao and Dagongbao newspapers here, which support the Chiang government, are also dissatisfied with the Chiang government's opening of trade with Japan. An editorial in the Yishibao on the 25th of last month stated: "Opening trade with Japan is only in the unilateral interest of Japan. The Chinese authorities (referring to the Chiang Kai-shek regime) should consider the future of Chinese industry and should not be heartless and liverless." It also pointed out: "The Allied Headquarters in Japan is not the supreme government of China (referring to the Chiang Kai-shek regime). China (referring to the Chiang Kai-shek authorities) should not cooperate with the headquarters and ignore its own national interests." Regarding Chiang's bandit's measures to open trade with Japan, the newspaper questioned: "Is this kind of abnormal and perverse measure of actively transfusing blood to the enemy, fearing that the enemy country's industry will not develop, something that a country that advocates propriety, justice, integrity, and a sense of shame (note: Chiang's eight-legged essay) should have?" The Dagongbao also published an editorial on the 1st, pointing out: "The scars of the War of Resistance are still there, the compensation has not been resolved, the peace treaty has not been signed, and it is obvious that China's (referring to the KMT-controlled areas) industry is on a bumpy road, while Japan's industry has been rejuvenated and is lush and green (referring to the US supporting Japan's aggressive economic recovery). Under these circumstances, China (the Chiang government) should not talk about trade with Japan, which is harmful and has no benefit, and should not do business that is all about harming oneself and benefiting others." The newspaper satirized Chiang Kai-shek's opening of trade with Japan as "blindly following the suggestions of other countries (referring to the United States) and opening up a convenient door for the capital of wealthy families (referring to the four major families)."

  　盲从美国损害中国利益
    蒋报著论不满开放对日贸易
    【新华社陕北十三日电】天津迟到消息：此间拥护蒋政府的报纸益世报及大公报也均不满蒋政府开放对日贸易。益世报上月二十五日社论称：“对日开放贸易，仅属日本片面利益，中国当局（按指蒋家朝廷）应为中国工业前途着想，不应毫无心肝。”并指出：“驻日盟军总部，并非中国（按指蒋家朝廷）太上政府，中国（按即蒋家当局）不应与该总部相配合而忽视本国利益。”对蒋贼开放对日贸易的措施，该报质问称：“这种积极向敌人输血惟恐敌国工业不发达的反常悖理的措施，是否为提倡礼义廉耻（按：蒋八股）的国家所应有？”大公报于一日亦著社论指出：“抗战伤痕犹在，对赔偿未解决，和约未签订，眼见中国（按指蒋管区）工业在颠顿坎坷途中，日本工业则已枯木逢春，青葱一片（按指美扶植日本侵略经济复兴），在这种情形下，中国（蒋政府）不应谈有百害而无一利的对日贸易，不该去做尽是损己利人的生意。”该报讽示蒋介石开放对日贸易为“盲从他国（按指美国）建议，为豪门（按指四大家族）资本再辟方便之门。”
