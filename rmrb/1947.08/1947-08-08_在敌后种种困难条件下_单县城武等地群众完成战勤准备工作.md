    [This Dispatch from our Newspaper in the Ji-Lu-Yu Region on the 6th] Under various difficult conditions behind enemy lines, the masses in Shanxian City have completed 100% of their war preparation work. When they heard that the People's Liberation Army was heading south, they were all happy and said, "The day we've been waiting for has arrived, we must contribute!" Regardless of how many times the enemy went to the village in a day, they still actively carried out the work. In Shanxian County, except for the villages near the city, all other villages and townships organized village headquarters, fully prepared flour, firewood, stretchers, and carts. The masses also voluntarily prepared sesame oil and dried vegetables. They were also afraid of heavy rain making it difficult to pull carts, so they prepared some horses, mules, and donkeys. The supplies prepared by the village headquarters along the ×× highway were also secretly hidden in underground tunnels for fear of being looted by the enemy. Although the county is located between four highways, not only was the war preparation completed 100%, but it also exceeded the task. The carts and stretchers requested by the headquarters were immediately prepared. The enemy-adjacent area of Chengwu County also completed war preparation work. The village headquarters voluntarily discussed making new stretchers, saying, "Small beds are heavy when carried far; besides, our comrades won't be comfortable lying on them." All villages are busy planing trees to make them. In particular, the headquarters of a certain village in the Seventh District, only two miles away from the Chiang Kai-shek army's stronghold, picked up wood and made it in the sorghum fields.

    在敌后种种困难条件下
    单县城武等地群众
    完成战勤准备工作
    【本报冀鲁豫六日电】单县城的群众在敌后种种困难条件下，百分之百的完成了战勤准备工作。当他们听说人民解放军南下，都喜欢的说：“咱盼望的这一天来到了，咱可得出点力！”不管敌人一天往村里几趟，仍积极进行工作。单县全县除城的附近，其他乡里各村，均组织了村指挥部，充分的准备了面、柴、担架、大车，群众又自动的准备了麻油、干菜。他们还怕下大雨，拉大车困难，又准备了些马、骡与驴子。在××公路沿线各村指挥部准备的东西，又怕敌人去抢，就秘密的藏在地洞里，该县虽处在四条公路之间，战勤准备不但百分之百的完成，还超过了任务。指挥部要的大车、担架，他们就马上准备好了，城武县接敌区同样完成了战勤准备工作。各村指挥部自动讨论制造新担架，他们说：“小床子抬的远了就重了；再说咱的同志躺着也不舒服。”各村都忙着刨树赶制。特别是七区某村指挥部，距蒋军据点只二里路，就把木料拾到高梁地里去做。
