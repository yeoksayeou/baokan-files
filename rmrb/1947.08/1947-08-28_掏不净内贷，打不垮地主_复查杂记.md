Unable to Empty Internal Loans, Unable to Defeat Landlords
　　Review of Investigations
　　·Wang Yaping·
　　“Landlords' hidden wealth, they won't tell if you don't beat them!”
　　This was said by a poor peasant cadre at a landlord struggle meeting. He also explained to the masses: "Poor folks, think about it, why do landlords hide silver dollars and silver ingots? Isn't it because silver dollars and silver ingots can be sold for money, are valuable, easy to hide, and easy to carry around! They are convenient to use!"
　　“If you can’t empty the silver money hidden by the landlords, you can’t defeat the landlords!”
　　At a small district representative meeting, they clarified their understanding of landlords hiding silver money, and everyone gave reports to each other. In addition, I read hundreds of "Emancipation Manuscripts," which described in many places the methods by which landlords buried silver dollars, and the circumstances under which silver money was excavated through torture and interrogation:
　　1. Xiao Jiasu, a landlord in Hezhai, Puyang County, hid silver dollars and silverware under the toilet.
　　2. Yan Peizhi, a landlord in Tongzhiying, buried wheat until it rotted into manure, and dug out more than a hundred silver dollars and a box full of silverware from it.
　　3. Li Renzhao, a landlord in Shangcun, Guancheng, packed silver dollars in tin cans and buried them in the melon field, and only confessed when he was beaten half to death.
　　4. Sun Xicheng, a landlord in Hancunj, Weihe County, dug out 280,000 yuan of Lu banknotes after a thorough reinvestigation.
　　5. After the struggle against the landlord in Nanjiecun, Puyang County Second District, 180 silver dollars were dug out from under the stove.
　　6. When the masses struggled against the landlord Hao Bingyun in Houzhuangpu, Guancheng, they pulled him up and threw him down hard. Unable to bear it, he said there were silver dollars inside the three doors, and forty strings of copper coins and one silver dollar were dug out.
　　7. When struggling against the landlord Chen Mingtang in Hubuzhai, Puyang County, they pulled him and beat him, and he said, "There is no more floating wealth." Comrade Huang, the director of the Women's Federation, went to his house and scolded his wife, saying, "Your husband said you know where the floating wealth is buried, quickly lead us to dig it up, or we'll pull you up!" She led them to dig out five large packages, a large can of copper coins, and silver dollars, totaling 56 catties of copper coins and 206 silver dollars.
　　8. Sanxiao, a landlord in the Second District of Qingfeng, buried silver dollars in several places, taking out more than ten yuan each time he was struggled against; after being struggled against five times, he couldn't hold on any longer and took out another 900 yuan.
　　Having read the above examples of landlords burying silver money, we have one conclusion, that is, landlords mostly bury silver dollars, copper coins, and silver ingots in order to "leave a way out." This fully shows that the landlord's idea of ​​changing the world has a long history. Spending silver dollars was a matter of more than ten years ago, spending copper coins was a matter of more than twenty years ago, and spending cash coins was a matter of thirty or forty years ago.
　　"Silver money is the landlord's lifeline." Decades ago, they were preparing to bury money. They vainly tried to use the superior position of money (economy) to forever stand on top of the poor folks, acting recklessly, ruling, and oppressing the poor. This selfish root, stubborn root, the root of ruling thought, the root of little Chiang Kai-shek, must be cut off, dug up cleanly, without leaving a trace.
　　Landlords and silver money are inseparable. Today, to defeat the landlords, we must find a way to first cut off the landlords' silver money chains, so that the landlords don't have a single silver dollar, not a single banknote, so that the landlords cannot bully others!
　　Cut off the landlord's magic weapon to rule the poor, cut off the landlord's lifeline to rule the poor, and reverse the lives of the poor and the landlords, so that the people can be completely liberated, and have a good life of labor, freedom, and happiness!

　　掏不净内贷，打不垮地主
  　复查杂记
    ·王亚平·
    “地主内货，不打不说”！
    这是一个贫农村干，在斗争地主大会上说的话。他还向群众解释了一下：“穷爷们，都想想，地主为啥藏银元，藏元宝？还不是银元、元宝能卖钱，值钱多，好埋藏，又容易带着走！用起来方便！”
    “掏不净地主藏的银钱，就打不垮地主”！
    在一个小区代表大会上，他们明确了对地主藏银钱的认识，大家互相作了报告。另外，我看了几百篇“翻身文稿”，上面很多地方写着地主埋藏银元的方法，和拷打审问发掘出银钱的情形：
    １、濮县河寨地主萧家肃把银元、银器、藏到厕所底下。
    ２、同智营地主阎佩芝把麦子埋成了烂粪，从里面刨出银元百余元，银器一满匣。
    ３、观城上村地主李仁昭把银元用洋铁罐装好，埋到瓜地里，打的要死时才说出来。
    ４、卫河县韩村集地主孙希成，经彻底复查，查掘出鲁钞二十八万元。
    ５、濮县二区南街村，斗地主后，在灶火底下掘出银元一百八十元。
    ６观城侯庄铺斗地主郝炳云，群众把他拉起来，猛一摔，他吃不住了，说三门里边有银元，掘出铜子四十吊，银元一个。
    ７、濮县户部寨斗地主陈明堂，拉滑子，打，他说：“没浮财了”。妇会主任黄同志到他家，叱他媳妇说：“你丈夫说了，浮财你知道埋的地方，快领俺们去掘，要不，把你拉起来！”她领着掘出五个大包袱，一大罐铜子、银元，计铜子五十六斤、银元二百零六元。
    ８、清丰二区地主三笑把银元埋了好几个地方，斗一次拿出十几元来；斗一次，拿出十几元来，第五次撑不住了，又拿出九百元来。
    看过以上地主埋藏银钱的例子，叫我们有一个结论，就是地主为了“留后手”，多半都埋藏着银元、铜子、元宝。足见地主的变天思想是由来已久了。花银元是十几年以前的事，花铜子是二十几年以前的事，花制钱是三四十年以前的事。
    “银钱是地主的命根子”，几十年以前，他们都准备着埋钱了。他们妄想拿金钱（经济）的优越地位，永远站在穷爷们头顶上，胡作乱为、统治、压迫着穷人。这种自私的根，顽固的根，统治思想的根，小老蒋的根，一定要刨断它，掘的干干净净，一丝不留。
    地主与银钱是分不开的，今天，要打垮地主，就得生法先斩断地主的银钱锁链，叫地主没有一个银元，没有一张钞票，叫地主不能仗势欺人！
    斩断地主统治穷人的法宝，斩掉地主统治穷人的命根子，把穷人和地主的生活倒转来，老百姓才能彻底翻身，才能有劳动、自由、幸福的好日子！
