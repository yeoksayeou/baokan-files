　　Hetou Organizes Surplus Labor for Textile and Stone Grinding
  　Earning 130,000 Jin of Rice in Half a Year
    [Report from our reporter team on the 14th] Hetou Village, in the Fourth District of Shahe, in addition to actively carrying out agricultural production, also organizes all surplus labor to engage in sideline production. The achievements in sideline production in the first half of the year are equivalent to more than half of the total harvest of wheat and autumn crops in previous years. The village has 120 households, 507 people, and 2,300 mu of land. In normal years, the wheat and autumn harvests are no more than 220,000 jin of refined grain. This year, due to lack of rain and poor harvest, the village, with the support of the county cooperative, has restored the stone grinding industry, which had been stagnant for ten years, and vigorously developed textiles and organized transportation. In the past six months, sideline earnings have reached more than 133,000 jin of rice. The specific achievements of each industry are reported separately below: 1. Women's textiles: There are currently nine groups with 157 women. In half a year, they wove and sold 2,000 jin of cloth, and made 1,000 jin of cloth for their own use, earning 27,000 jin of millet and 9,460 jin of wheat. In half a year, 26 spinning wheels were added, reaching one spinning wheel per woman. The number of looms increased from 30 to 42. The village is now looking for craftsmen and planning materials to convert all spinning wheels into accelerated wheels. 2. The stone grinding industry is one of the three treasures of Shahe County. Hetou produces millstones, but during the Japanese occupation, the industry was devastated. Poor farmers called this treasure mountain "Hunger Mountain," and it has been stagnant for more than ten years. This year, the village's liberated farmers' cooperative organized 32 people to restore the stone grinding industry. 368 millstones have been produced, and after deducting all expenses, a net profit of 55,550 jin of millet has been earned. In addition to food, the workers also earned 20,167 jin of rice in wages. The democratic government has abolished official taxes, and liberated farmers are wholeheartedly devoted to mountain construction. In half a year, 400 jin of steel tools have been added, and there will be greater development in the second half of the year. 3. Transportation: A transportation team of 30 people and animals has been formed around the stone grinding industry, earning a net profit of 10,000 jin of millet in half a year, enough for the whole village to eat for half a month. Combining the profits of textiles and stone grinding, 20 large cattle have been added in half a year. The masses of Hetou are preparing to develop sideline production on a large scale, but still regard agricultural production as fundamental. After the rain on the 28th of last month, all the white land has been sown. When the reporter left the village, the late seedlings had been hoed over for the first time. More than three hectares of land, which had been barren during the Japanese occupation, has been half reclaimed and planted with 70 mu of buckwheat. Village Chief Han Chunlan told the reporter with great joy: "Look! With this kind of labor, in five years, the livestock in our village will all be replaced with mules!" (Lin Li)

　　河头组织余工纺织打磨
  　半年赚米十三万斤
    【本报记者团十四日电】沙河四区河头村，于积极进行农业生产之外，并组织一切剩余劳力，从事副业生产，上半年副业成绩已相等于往常年麦秋两季收获总数二分之一强。该村有一百廿户，五百零七人，土地二千三百亩，平常年景，麦秋收成不过二十二万斤细粮。今年缺雨歉收，该村在县联社扶植下，将停滞十年的凿石合磨业恢复起来，并大力开展纺织，组织运输，半年来，副业赚米已达十三万三千余斤。现将各业具体成绩分别报导于下：一、妇女纺织，现有九个小组，纺妇一百五十七人，半年间织卖布二千斤，自穿布一千斤，赚小米二万七千斤，麦子九千四百六十斤。半年增加纺车二十六辆，达到每个纺妇一纺车，织布机由三十架增至四十二架，刻下该村正寻觅匠人，筹划木料，准备把所有的纺车都改为加速轮车。一、开山合磨业是沙河县三大宝之一，河头产磨，但在日寇统治时代，磨业横遭摧残，贫苦农民把这座宝山叫做“饥饿山”，一直停顿了十来年，今年该村翻身农民合作社，组织三十二个人，恢复了磨业，已出磨三百六十八盘，除去一切费用，净赚小米五万五千五百五十斤。工人除吃外，又赚工资米二万零一百六十七斤。民主政府废除了官税，翻身农民尽心致力于山石建设，半年间增添了四百斤钢的工具，下半年还会有更大发展。三、运输业，围绕着磨业，组成有人畜各三十的运输队，半年净赚小米一万斤，够全村人半月食用，结合纺织与磨业的利润，半年内增加了二十头大牛。河头群众，准备大规模发展副业，但对农业生产，仍视为根本。上月二十八日雨后，所有白地都已下种，记者离开该村时，晚苗已锄过头遍，日寇统治时代荒芜了的三顷多地，已开垦了一半，种上七十亩荞麦。村长韩春兰，以十分喜悦的心情语记者：“看吧！这样劳动，五年后俺村牲口就都换成了骡子！”　（林里）
