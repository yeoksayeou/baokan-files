    Chiang Controlled Area Snippets
    On the 4th of last month, the US imperialist navy extravagantly celebrated "American Independence Day" on Chinese territory in Qingdao. Cannons boomed on the sea, Marine Corps bands landed and performed, and two US planes performed in the skies over Qingdao. Just as the festivities were in full swing, one of the US planes experienced a mechanical failure and made an emergency landing at the airport, exploding upon impact.
    Su Tiren, the great traitor of Shanxi and puppet province governor under Wang Jingwei, colluded with Yan Xishan the year before last and has not been punished in any way. He is now swaggering through the streets of Taiyuan as before, behaving as he pleases, much to the scorn of the citizens.
