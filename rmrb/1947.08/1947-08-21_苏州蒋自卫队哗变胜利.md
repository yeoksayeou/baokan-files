Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 18th—Regarding the mutiny of two companies of the Chiang Kai-shek "Self-Defense Force" in Suzhou, according to delayed reports from Shanghai newspapers, the details are as follows: At the end of June, the Chiang Kai-shek county government in Suzhou learned that several hundred people from the "Self-Defense Force" in various districts had refused to be incorporated into the regular army for the civil war. Under the pretext of inspecting the troops, they ordered them to enter the city and concentrated them in the public stadium, which was surrounded by machine guns and guard posts. Just as they were preparing to forcibly disarm them, the self-defense force rose up in resistance, and gunfire erupted. Shops closed their doors and suspended business. Finally, the self-defense force successfully broke out of the heavily guarded city of Suzhou and headed for the mountains. Afterwards, the county magistrate stated that the "Self-Defense Force" had become disorganized since then.

　　苏州蒋自卫队哗变胜利
    【新华社陕北十八日电】苏州蒋记“自卫队”两连哗变事，据迟到沪报消息，其详情如下：六月底苏州蒋记县政府得悉各区“自卫队”数百人拒绝补充为内战正规军，以检阅队伍为借口，命令其开入城内，并集中于四周架设机枪布置岗哨的公共体育场中。正当准备强迫缴械之际，该自卫队奋起反抗，一时枪声大作，商店纷纷闭门停业，最后自卫队胜利冲出戒备森严的苏州城，开赴山地。事后该县县长表示：“自卫队”自此以后已趋涣散。
