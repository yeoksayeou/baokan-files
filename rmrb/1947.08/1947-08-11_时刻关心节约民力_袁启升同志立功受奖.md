　　【Taiyue, Our Newspaper, 9th】Yuan Qisheng, a clerk in the Civil Affairs Section of Qinshui County, was commended by the County Merit Committee for saving more than 2,000 civilian labor days in three months through precise calculations and patient persuasion. His methods for saving civilian labor are introduced below: 1. Personally inspect, calculate precisely, and allocate discrepancies according to the actual quantity of transportation. For example, when a certain district was transporting military uniforms to the front, it required 208 civilian laborers; however, after Comrade Yuan personally inspected and calculated precisely, he found that 149 civilian laborers could complete the task, saving 59 civilian labor days. In another instance, when a certain brigade was transporting military uniforms, it originally requested 93 civilian laborers, but only 71 were allocated and the task was completed, saving 22 civilian labor days. When a certain brigade needed six carts to transfer wounded and sick soldiers, he persuaded lightly ill soldiers to take turns walking, resulting in only three carts being allocated, saving three carts. In more than ten instances, a total of 233 civilian labor days, 16 carts, and 15 donkeys were saved. 2. Persuade civilian laborers from other counties to carry back cargo. For example, when a replenishment regiment was transferring 150 sick soldiers to a certain county, using 50 carts, Comrade Qisheng personally waited at the main road crossing and encountered 30 carts from other counties transporting supplies to the rear. He patiently persuaded the cart drivers with the principle of "saving civilian labor is a meritorious service to the people," and had them carry the sick soldiers, saving 30 carts. A total of 98 carts were saved. The Qinshui Chengguan reception station needed a large quantity of public grain, but had to dispatch civilian laborers from the first and second district warehouses to transport it. He consulted with the Finance Section and took advantage of the opportunity when civilian laborers from the first and second districts were gathering in Qinshui Chengguan, having them carry over 47,000 jin of public grain, saving 798 civilian labor days. 3. Mobilize civilian laborers to transfer public grain before departure and help the masses with production. For example, in June, 2,000 civilian laborers from Yangcheng, Shimin, and Fushan gathered in Qinshui Chengguan to participate in the war. As the people in charge of leading the group had not arrived on time, Comrade Yuan Qisheng actively suggested to the leaders that they mobilize the civilian laborers to transfer 48,140 jin of public grain, over 2,000 jin of cotton, and over 7,000 jin of fertilizer, saving 966 civilian labor days. The civilian laborers from the three counties also helped the masses hoe 501 mu of land, harvest 100 mu of wheat, carry 100 loads of manure, and collect over 20,000 jin of firewood without compensation, approximately equivalent to 332 labor days. Statistics show that from early April to the end of June alone, a total of 2,329 civilian labor days, 114 ox carts, and 15 donkeys were saved.

　　时刻关心节约民力
  　袁启升同志立功受奖
    【本报太岳九日电】沁水县民政科员袁启升同志精确计算耐心说服，三个月节省民力二千余，得到县立功委员会嘉奖。兹将他节省民力的办法介绍于后：一、亲自检查，精确计算，按运输的实际数量拨差。如某分区往前方运军衣时，要民夫二百零八个；但经袁同志亲自检查后，经过精确计算，派出民夫一百四十九名也能完成，节省民力五十九个。又×旅运军衣，原要民夫九十三人，拨了七十一人即担完，节省民力二十二个。某旅转运伤病员要用大车六辆，他说服轻病号轮流步行，结果只拨了大车三辆，节省三辆。十多次共节省民力二百三十三个，大车十六辆，毛驴十五头。二、说服外县民夫捎回脚。如补充团往某县转送病员一百五十个，用车五十辆，启升同志亲自到大路口等着，遇有外县往后方转运物资的大车三十辆，他便用“节省民力为民立功”的道理耐心说服了赶车民夫，即将病员捎走，节省大车三十辆。前后共节省大车九十八辆。沁水城关招待站需要大批公粮，但得专派民夫从一、二区仓库运来，他便和财政科商讨，利用一、二区支差民夫到沁水城集合的机会，捎运公粮四万七千余斤，节省民夫七百九十八人。三、动员民夫在出发前转运公粮，帮助群众生产。如六月间阳城、士敏、浮山参战民夫二千个，在沁水城集合，带差的人没有按时来，袁启升同志便积极向首长建议，动员民夫转运公粮四万八千一百四十斤，棉花二千余斤，花料七千余斤，节省民力九百六十六人。三县民夫还无代价帮助群众锄地五百零一亩，割麦一百亩，担粪一百担，打柴二万余斤，大约折工三百三十二个。统计仅四月初到六月底三个月，共节省民力二千三百二十九个，牛车一百一十四辆，毛驴十五头。
