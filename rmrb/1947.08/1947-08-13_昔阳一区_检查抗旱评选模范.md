　　Xiyang First District
  　Inspecting Drought Resistance and Selecting Models
    [Reported by our newspaper from Xiyang] At the First District's meeting of more than two thousand people commemorating the "August 1st" anniversary of the founding of the People's Liberation Army, the one-month drought resistance work (from July 1st to August 1st) was reviewed. Before the meeting, village production drought resistance models had already been evaluated. At the meeting, meritorious deeds were reported and evaluated based on base points. Finally, heroes who had turned over a new leaf, such as Guo Guanghua, Wang Bangshou, Guo Junke, Wang Chongxi (female), Li Yinshuo, Mao Sini (female), and honorary soldier Li Baocheng, along with one hundred and ninety other meritorious models, were selected. Due to the severity of the drought, initially, some of the masses were somewhat panicked. Under their leadership, various negative and pessimistic sentiments of the masses were resolved, and they actively engaged in drought resistance, creating many new methods and making significant achievements. For example, Wang Bangshou, Guo Junke, and Wang Chongxi of Zhongsi Village created "collective groups." The whole village gathered a total of forty-two dan of grain, accumulating a small community granary. In addition, the transportation organization's dividends will not be distributed this year, in preparation for surviving the famine next year. Their famine survival plan is as follows: The whole village has more than fifty households, one hundred and eighty people. If each person saves two taels of grain, they can save thirty dan in three months; Organize two stonemasons to build a coal kiln. In addition to supplying the village's needs, they can earn one hundred dan of grain a year; Also, organize four carpenters and ten mat weavers to make weaving machines and mats in the village, turning farmers into workers without having to sell anything, and weaving can earn fifteen dan; In addition, they have gathered 93,072 jin of wild vegetables, bought 595 jin of bran, and are preparing to plant 60 mu of vegetables after the rain. They have now watered 30 mu of corn to keep it alive, which can also yield 30 dan, so the whole village can eat until June of next year. Their storage method: establish a drought resistance committee to uniformly manage and store individually. Leadership method: each line has its own leader, uniformly calculating points and converting them into work points; Their slogan is: "We are not afraid of starving to death this year, we are preparing to survive next year." Now, morale is high, and men and women, old and young, are trying every means to fight the drought. Guo Guanghua is a hero who turned over a new leaf. He has already made a small contribution in the Zhengtai Campaign this spring. During this production drought resistance period, he led the masses to protect young seedlings and rescued 120 mu of corn, making another contribution. He is preparing to turn one qing of dry land into paddy fields and plant vegetables, so that there will be food earlier; In addition, he organizes the masses for transportation, etc., to make up for the poor harvest. He said: According to the demands of the masses, we will try every means to survive the famine. And he said: In the future, we will listen more to the opinions of the masses to transform ourselves, without being complacent, and strive to make greater contributions. Honorary soldier Li Baocheng is a second-class disabled veteran. He made contributions in drought resistance. He said: "I have turned over a new leaf myself. I will produce and save more, plant more vegetables, and donate the 1,560 jin of rice that I should receive as blood money this year to support the front line." He also gave the three dan of wheat that he transported to the masses as seeds. Under their lead, the whole district has watered 9,633 mu of corn, opened 617 mu of vegetable fields (statistics from 19 villages), and will immediately sow vegetables; transported 80 dan of grain that has already been produced (statistics from two villages), and gathered 93,072 jin of wild vegetables. After the conference elected meritorious officials, drought resistance work spread to every corner of the district. (Ming Xian, De Rong, Kou Cheng, Bang Han)

    【本报昔阳讯】一区二千余群众纪念“八一”解放军诞生日大会上，检查一月抗旱工作（七一到八一），先在会前经过酝酿已评出村的生产抗旱模范，大会上以基点报功评功，最后选出翻身英雄郭广华、王邦寿、郭俊科、王崇喜（女）、李银锁、毛四妮（女）、荣誉军人李保成等一百九十七名功臣模范。由于旱灾比较严重，最初一般群众有些惊慌，在他们的带领下，解决了群众各种消极悲观情绪，积极进行抗旱，创造了许多新的办法，做出了显著成绩：如中思乐王邦寿、郭俊科、王崇喜，创造了“聚团社”，全村共聚了四十二石粮食，积成小义仓，另组织运输有的红利今年不分，准备明年渡荒。他们的渡荒计划是这样：全村五十多户，一百八十口人，每人节约三两粮，三个月能节约三十石；组织两个石匠打下一座煤窑，除供给本村烧外，一年能赚一百石粮；又组织四个木匠、十个席匠，在村打织布机、打席，以农变工，不用化销，纺织能赚十五石；此外打下九万三千零七十二斤野菜，买下糠五百九十五斤，并准备雨后种六十亩菜，现浇活三十亩玉茭，也能收三十石，这样全村能吃到明年六月。他们的保管办法：成立抗旱委员会，统一管理各自保存。领导方法：各行各有领导者，统一计分折工；他们的口号是：今年不怕饿死人，准备明年渡活命。现在情绪高涨，男女老少都在想尽一切办法向灾荒决斗。郭广华是翻身中的英雄，今春正太战役中已立了一小功，这段生产抗旱中，领导群众保护青苗，抢救下一百廿亩玉茭，又立一功，他准备把一顷旱地改为水地，都种成菜，能够早接上嘴；另组织群众运输等，来弥补歉收。他说：根据群众要求，想尽一切办法，渡过荒年。并说：今后多倾听群众意见，来改造自己，毫不自满，要争取功上加功。荣誉军人李保成是乙等残废，在生产抗旱中立了功，他说：我自己翻了身啦，我多生产节约，多种些菜，把我今年应领的血金一千五百六十斤米支援前线。并把他运输所有的三石麦子给群众做种籽。全区在他们的带头影响下，浇玉茭九千六百三十三亩，开出菜地六百一十七亩（十九个村统计），马上撒上菜；运输已产下八十石粮食（二个村统计），打下野菜九万三千零七十二斤。经大会评选功臣后，抗旱工作普及全区每个角落。（明显、德荣、叩成、邦汉）
