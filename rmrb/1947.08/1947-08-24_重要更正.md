　　Important Correction
    In the article "Discussion on the Three Great Combinations," a winning entry in the first news and literary awards announced on the 12th of this month, it was originally researched by the Ping Shun Joint Office and written by Comrade Lin Hua. The announcement mistakenly attributed it to Comrade Wang Julin. In addition to sending a special letter of apology from the Ping Shun Joint Office, we hereby make this correction. (August 21st, this newspaper's Liaison Department)
