Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 11th: According to the Shanghai News on the 14th of last month: The rice shortage in Chengdu is severe. According to statistics published by a certain news agency, one grain of rice is worth 4 Jiao of Chiang currency. The Chiang authorities' ration of white rice is only 13 Liang per household per day, which is not enough to feed one person. A famous Dan (female) actor in a certain theater in the city performed "Beating the Fat Official" to expose the root cause of the rice shortage being the "fat officials," expressing the people's resentment towards the Chiang government. Because it was resented by the Chiang family's military police, she was immediately arrested.

　　蒋家当局制造米荒
  　成都人民表示愤恨
    【新华社陕北十一日电】据沪新闻报上月十四日载：成都米荒严重，据某通讯社发表统计，白米一颗值蒋币四角。蒋当局的配白米，每户每日仅十三两，一人尚不足饱。该市某戏院一名旦特演员“打胖官”，以揭发米荒根源在于“胖官”，表示人民对蒋政府之愤恨。因遭蒋家军警之忌，旋即被捕。
