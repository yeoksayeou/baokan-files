Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 16th. Comprehensive news from newspapers in Peiping and Tianjin reveals that teachers and students at all levels of schools in the Kuomintang-controlled areas of North China are living in increasingly dire starvation. University and middle school students are all yearning for a bright future. The funding for universities in Peiping and Tianjin relies on loans. When the loans are due, they often cannot be repaid and they must further beg the banks for new loans to pay salaries. Since last month, Peking University has strictly limited salary advances. Those who have no outstanding debts are only allowed to borrow 400,000 yuan. If the university borrows 1 million yuan from the bank on behalf of the faculty, it must bear an interest of 120,000 yuan per month. To this end, Peking University professors Yang Renbian, Zheng Huachi, and Fan Hong appealed to the school authorities at the end of last month to appeal to the Chiang Kai-shek Education Department to improve their treatment, requesting assistance according to the examples of Nanjing and Shanghai, with the monthly distribution of two bags of flour and half a ton of coal. After Peking University professors issued their appeal, Tsinghua University also responded in turn. The treatment of professors at Nankai University in Tianjin remains between 300,000 and 400,000 yuan per month, barely enough for one person's food. Professor Peng Zhongduo, who has been teaching for twenty years and has never been involved in external affairs, also sighed with emotion while buying coal: "If it continues to rise like this, we will not be able to endure it anymore." Even the Ta Kung Pao, a newspaper of the Chiang family's political science faction, admitted in an editorial on the 17th of last month: "The poverty of the national universities and colleges in Peiping and Tianjin has reached its peak."

As for the lives of university and middle school students, they are also extremely difficult. The vast majority of university students rely on public funding for living expenses. Tsinghua University alone has 1,290 people relying on full public funding and 330 people relying on half public funding for survival. Recently, the Chiang government blatantly abolished the public funding system, which will inevitably force more students to become out of school. The phenomenon of university students dropping out of school and becoming unemployed due to lack of livelihood has become widespread. The social service and job search columns of newspapers in Peiping and Tianjin frequently publish job advertisements from university students. On the 21st of last month, the Tianjin Yishibao published a job search letter from Zhang Yichen, a student at Nankai University, stating: Due to financial difficulties, he cannot attend school and has no hope of employment. His father used to be a temporary employee of the UN Relief and Rehabilitation Administration and is now unemployed. His self-help work at school has also been stopped due to lack of funding, and all economic sources are now cut off. He needs 300,000 yuan per month for food alone, so he can't see a way out no matter how he thinks about it. This letter fully reflects the anxiety of university students in the Kuomintang-controlled areas of North China.

The lives of middle school students are just as difficult as those of university students. On the blackboard in a classroom of Tianjin Municipal No. 1 Middle School, it is written in large letters: "We can't survive, the cornmeal has risen again!" The meals at Nankai Middle School cost 180,000 yuan per month for type A and 96,000 yuan for type B, which is very poor, but students still cannot afford it. The meals at Hebei Institute of Technology cost 90,000 yuan per month, and even students on public funding and those without homes cannot afford it.

The biggest difficulty for primary school students is the problem of entering higher education. For example, in the entire city of Qingdao, there are only a dozen or so middle schools, such as Municipal Middle School, Chongde, and Lixian. All schools are short of funds, their equipment is incomplete, and their capacity is limited. According to the current ratio of applicants to admissions in each school, three-fifths of primary school graduates will not be able to enter middle school next semester. The number of unemployed and out-of-school youths in Qingdao is also alarming, accounting for 80% of the total number of youths. Only the children of the 20% of wealthy and middle-class families have the opportunity to enter school.

The current education crisis in the Kuomintang-controlled areas of North China is like a paralyzed patient. For the past two years, the education sector and students in Peiping and Tianjin have personally experienced the source of their disasters from the "victory disaster," "rehabilitation disaster," "price disaster," and the rampant activities of Chiang Kai-shek's secret agents and the complete loss of academic freedom. They deeply believe that the end of Chiang Kai-shek's traitorous and dictatorial rule is the foundation for the new life of education in North China. Many university and middle school students want to pass through the Chiang Kai-shek army's blockade to seek a bright future in the liberated areas. During the summer vacation, many students successfully arrived at the North China United University and Northern University in the liberated areas, living in a new world of democracy and freedom.

　　华北蒋区教育界陷饥饿窘境
  　学生普遍失学失业
    咸望到解放区寻求光明出路
    【新华社陕北十六日电】综合平津报纸消息，华北蒋管区各级学校师生生活在每况愈下的饥饿状态中，大中学生均渴求光明出路。平津各大学经费均赖贷款撑持，贷款到期时，往往不能偿还，且须进一步向银行哀求新贷款用以发薪。北大上月份起严格限制备薪，如已往无积欠者，仅准借四十万元，若由校方代向银行贷款百万元，则每月需负担利息达十二万元。为此，北大教授杨人鞭、郑华炽、樊弘等于上月底请学校当局代向蒋记教育部呼吁改善待遇，要求援京、沪例，每月配售面粉两袋、煤半吨。北大教授发出呼吁后，清华学校亦次第响应。天津南开大学教授待遇，每月仍停留在三四十万元之间，仅敷一人伙食。任教二十年，一向不问外事的彭仲铎教授在购煤途中，亦喟然长叹：“再这样涨下去，我们忍无可忍了。”甚至蒋家政学系的大公报，亦于上月十七日社论中承认：“平津国立各院校的穷相，已臻透顶”。
    至于大中学生生活，亦极为困苦。大学生绝大多数赖公费生活，清华一校即有一千二百九十人倚靠全公费，三百三十人倚靠半公费维生。最近蒋政府悍然取消公费制度，势必迫使更多学生沦于失学。大学生因生活无着而失学失业者，已成普遍现象。平津报纸社会服务栏及求职栏经常刊戴大学生求职广告，上月二十一日天津益世报刊出南开大学学生张贻琛求职信，内称：因经济困难不能就学，亦无望就业，父亲以前为联总临时雇员，现已失业。他在学校的自助工作亦因经费拮据而停止，目下一切经济来源均告断绝，每月吃饭就需三十万元，因此想来想去都没有出路。这封信足以充份反映华北蒋管区大学生的彷徨。
    中学生生活与大学生同样困苦，天津市立一中课室黑版上大书“活不了啦，棒子面又涨了！”南开中学伙食，甲种每月十八万元，乙种九万六千元，吃得非常坏，但学生还是负担不起，冀工学院每月伙食九万元，公费生及无家可归者仍交不出。
    小学生最困难的是升学问题。如象青岛全市中学仅有市中、崇德、礼贤等十余所，各校皆因经费无着，设备残缺，收容有限。依据目前各校报名人数与录取人数相比，下学期将有五分之三高小毕业生不能升入中学。而青市失学失业青年数目亦至惊人，占青年总数百分之八十，仅百分之二十富裕及中产家庭子弟有机会入学。
    目前华北蒋管区教育危机，正如一瘫患病的病人。平津教育界与学生，两年来从“胜利灾”、“复员灾”、“物价灾”与蒋家特务横行，学术自由尽失的处境中，已切肤体验到他们灾难的来源，而深信蒋介石卖国独裁统治的结束，是华北教育新生的基础。许多大中学生都想通过蒋军封锁线，到解放区寻求光明出路。暑期中好些学生且顺利的到达解放区的华北联大、北方大学，生活在民主自由的新天地中。
