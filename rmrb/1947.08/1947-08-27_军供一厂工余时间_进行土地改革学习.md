　　Military Supply Factory No. 1 Conducts Land Reform Studies During Off-Work Hours
    [Our Dispatch] The No. 1 Clothing Factory of the Military Region Supply Department, during its intense production increase competition, is using evening off-work hours to conduct land reform education, launching a class investigation and thought investigation movement, with collective classes and group self-reflection. During the self-reflection process, comrades are frankly discussing their families and histories, examining their thoughts. Comrade Zhang Yingbiao, who came from a rich peasant background, said: "In my thinking, I have separated from my family. I am following the masses. I agree with my family being struggled against last year." Comrade Sun Sijiu, who came from a landlord background, said: "My grandfather was an old die-hard. I repeatedly advised him, but he refused to return the wealth he had exploited from the peasants. This time he was beaten to death by the masses, which is justified." A total of twenty comrades whose families were struggled against, after self-reflection and increased awareness, have expressed their willingness to abandon their original class stance and focus on revolutionary work. The factory called on: "Comrades from poor peasant backgrounds should write letters to encourage their families to bravely struggle against landlords; comrades from middle peasant backgrounds should mobilize their families to stand with the peasants and struggle against landlords; comrades from landlord and rich peasant backgrounds should mobilize their families to accept the peasants' just demands." Currently, all factory workers are writing letters to their families urging them to do so. (Ge Qin)

　　军供一厂工余时间　进行土地改革学习
    【本报讯】军区供给部第一被服厂，在紧张的增产竞赛运动中，利用晚上工余时间，进行土地改革教育，展开查阶级查思想运动，集体上课，分组反省，在反省的过程中，同志们都坦白的谈自己的家庭和历史，检查自己思想，出身富农的张应镳同志说：“在思想上与家庭分家，我跟群众走，去年家中被斗争我是同意的”。地主出身的孙四九同志说：“我的祖父是个老顽固，再三劝他，他不顾意把剥削来的财物，归还农民，这次被群众打死了，是应该的”。共有二十个家庭被斗争的同志，经过反省提高觉悟都表示愿意放下原来阶级立场，安心革命工作。工厂号召：“贫农出身的同志，去信鼓励家中，大胆向地主斗争；出身中农的同志，应动员家庭和农民站在一起向地主斗争；地主、富农出身的同志，应动员家中接受农民正义要求”。现下全厂职工正纷纷的向家中写劝说信。（葛钦）
