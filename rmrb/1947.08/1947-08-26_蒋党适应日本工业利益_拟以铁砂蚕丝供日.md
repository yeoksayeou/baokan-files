Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 24th: A dispatch from Nanjing on the 22nd: The Chiang Kai-shek clique's Ministry of Economic Affairs' Committee for Guiding Trade with Japan has drafted "import and export" items for trade with Japan. This project completely follows the requirements of the Japanese government's formulated "Sino-Japanese Trade Plan." China will supply Japan with iron sand, sugar, salt, paint, pig bristles, hemp, miscellaneous grains, soybeans, hides and furs, eggs, tobacco leaves, camphor, medicinal materials, silk, fruits, etc. It will also allow Japan to dump rayon, chemical products, metal products, transportation equipment, seedlings, whale oil, newsprint, etc., into China. It was revealed at a meeting of the Chiang Kai-shek's Executive Yuan National Economic Commission on the 21st that the Chiang government's planned act of supplying Japanese silk to Japan in exchange for Japanese rayon is intended to accommodate the interests of the Japanese silk weaving industry. The "import and export" items specifically note that the large-scale export of iron sand to Japan is mainly intended to exchange for transportation equipment for the civil war.
