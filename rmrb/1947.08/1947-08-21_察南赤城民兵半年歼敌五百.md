According to incomplete statistics, in the first half of this year, the county's militia independently fought 287 battles, killing, wounding, and capturing 571 Chiang, Fu, and puppet troops, capturing more than ten major strongholds outside the city, such as Huangtuling, and destroying 44 large and small bunkers.
