　　How to Dye with Indigo?
　　Ma Lin
　　Indigo should be harvested from the beginning of Autumn to the White Dew period. Harvesting too late, after the plant has begun to head, will reduce the indigo yield. Harvesting too early is also not good. The best time to harvest is in the morning when there is dew (but do not harvest after rain). Once harvested, it should be retted immediately. The method is to lay the indigo plants flat with the roots facing upwards, without bundling them, to prevent uneven retting. Press them down with flat stones, and fill with clean water (impure water will not produce good indigo). The water should just cover the stones. It takes about one day and one night to ret, but the duration depends on the water temperature. If the water is too cold, it may take two to three days.

　　To check if the indigo is retted properly, pull out three stems from the middle layer and hold them up to the sun. If the inside color is dull, with both light and dark areas, and the color has faded, it is a sign that it is retted properly. Another method is to rub a small piece of new white cloth on the indigo leaves. If the cloth does not pick up any color, it is ready. (When the indigo is retted, the stems and leaves will feel soft and slightly slippery, otherwise they will be hard and rough). At this point, start pouring the water into the indigo dyeing pool or vat (using a sieve to filter out any broken leaves and debris). While pouring the water, wring out the indigo plants. It is best to build the indigo dyeing pool with stones and seal it with lime to prevent leakage. The key to successful indigo dyeing is the lime. For a typical pool containing 1500 catties of indigo powder, use 10 to 15 catties of lime. If calculated by indigo water, add 4 catties of lime for the first batch of indigo water, 2 catties for the second batch, and adjust the amount for subsequent batches based on the situation. After the indigo water is placed in the dyeing pool or vat, slowly pour in the lime water while stirring with a stick. Small yellowish-white particles will gradually increase in the water, and when these particles become abundant, clear water lines will appear. After the lime is added to the pool, have two to three people stand beside it (only one person is needed when using a vat). Use indigo mallets to beat the mixture, each person beating about 800 to 1000 times, until the surface turns bluish-white. This is the first batch. The second batch (using the same method) should be beaten until the water turns eggplant-colored. The third batch should be red. If it is green, add some lime. After the fourth time, the indigo will settle, and the surface will be bluish-green or sesame oil-colored. After the last beating, clear water will be discharged. Scoop the indigo onto cloth to drain the water, and it will become usable indigo. Store it in a cool place to prevent it from overheating. Too cold a place is also not good, as it will affect the indigo's quality.

　　怎样打靛？
    马琳
    立秋到白露前后就要割靛，割的晚了一出穗就少出靛，割的太早了也不好，割的时间最好在早晨有露水时去割（但下雨后不能割），割了马上就沤。方法是蓝根朝上铺平，不要捆成捆，以防沤不匀。上面压上平石，灌以清水（水不清不出好靛），水能淹过石头就行，大概沤一天一夜就成了，时间长短，要看水的冷热来决定，太冷的话，须要沤二天到三天。
    看蓝沤好没有，可在中层抽出三根向着太阳照一下，里面颜色暗淡，有明有暗，色也退了，就是沤好的表现，再用一个办法，是用一小块新白布，在靛叶上一揉，布上不挂色就行了（靛沤好后茎和叶摸着是棉软的，稍带滑性，否则是硬涩的）。这时一面掏水倒入打靛池或缸里（要用筛箩过滤，不使碎叶杂物混入），一面把蓝棵拧干起来，沤靛池最好用石头砌成，石灰抹好，不使渗水以免跑靛，打靛主要关键是石灰问题，普通一池一千五百斤靛粉用石灰十斤到十五斤。如按靛水计算，每一桶靛水，头一漕下四斤石灰，第二漕添下二斤，以后就斟酌情形添。靛水放进打靛池或缸里之后，就把石灰水一面慢慢注入，一面用棍子搅拌，水里逐渐增加黄白色的小粒，这种小粒多了，现出一道道的清水纹来就行了。下池后旁边站两个人到三个人（用缸打只用一个人）。用打靛圪垛打，每人约打八百到一千左右，直到上面发青发白就可以了，这是第一漕，第二漕（打法一样），打成煮茄子色水就行，第三漕是红色，若是绿色加些石灰，第四次靛沉下后，表面是青绿色或香油色，打完最后一次就出清水，把靛掏在布上渗去水分，就成为可用之靛，把它放在凉快地方保存，不使发热，太冷的地方也不好，靛不好用。
