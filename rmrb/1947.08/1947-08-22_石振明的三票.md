Shi Zhenming's Three Tickets
	Jin Sha, Chen Quanlu
	As early as a year ago, labor hero Shi Zhenming created a three-ticket system in his mutual aid team - work tickets, participation tickets, and support-the-army tickets - to solve many difficulties in participation, supporting the army, and production, especially to resolve the contradiction between participation and production, truly achieving both without compromising either. But this was limited to those who were organized. Later, through the development and improvement of labor model Wang Baocai of Shibi, these tickets were circulated throughout the village, achieving 100% fairness. Everyone reflected, "This is the fairest method." Now, villages in Yicheng, Qinshui, and Hongdong have also adopted this three-ticket method.
	Initially, the three tickets could only be implemented among those who were already organized. Wang Baocai's Shibi village had also organized mutual aid groups, but due to unfair exchange of labor and unclear wages, it was called a "muddled group" by the masses, and no one wanted to participate in mutual aid anymore, which created difficulties. However, in April, the front lines needed people to support the war, and the rear needed people to rush to harvest wheat and plant millet and corn, which required a method that would allow both to be done without compromising either. First, Wang Baocai believed that it was necessary to mobilize everyone in the village, so it had to be done fairly. Therefore, Wang Baocai created a method called "base points." This base point is assessed according to each person's physical strength, similar to the assessment of land burden production. When settling accounts in the future, the total of all three types of work in the village is combined and borne in proportion to the "base points." The same applies to livestock. In addition, there is also a "earned point," which does not follow the "base point." The "base points" and "earned points" in Wang Baocai's village are defined as follows: "Base points": All militiamen participating in rotation duty will bear 10 points per person per day; stretcher bearers are divided into two types, 9 and 10 points; transporters are divided into two types, 7 and 8 points; those organizing exchange labor and supporting the army in the rear are divided into three types, 4, 5, and 6 points. In other words, in addition to militiamen, those assessed as 9 or 10 points based on labor must participate in stretcher bearing; those assessed as 7 or 8 points must participate in transportation; those assessed as 4, 5, or 6 points must participate in exchange labor, supporting the army, and other work in the rear. The "base points" for livestock are assessed based on the size and carrying capacity of the livestock. Donkeys are divided into three types, 10, 11, and 12 points. Cattle are divided into three types, 2, 3, and 4 points.
	"Earned points": Militiamen who are on rotation duty outside the village earn 10 points per person per day within three days, and this increases to 12 points per day after three days. Stretcher bearers earn the same 10 points within three days, and 11 points after three days. Transportation is calculated based on the weight and distance. Carrying one dou of rice earns 2.5 points, and four dou of rice earns 10 points. It is also stipulated that full laborers must carry at least four dou (based on the assessed base points). Livestock carrying eight dou earn 1.5 points per dou, totaling 12 points, with additional points for carrying more. Donkey drivers earn an additional 10 points. Ox carts with one ox pulling one cart earn 15 points for hauling at least 300 jin in one day, plus 10 points for the driver, totaling 25 points. Double-team single-pulling 500 jin earns 20 points, plus 40 points for two drivers, totaling 45 points. Those doing exchange labor in the rear are calculated based on the work done. Plowing one mu of land with an ox earns 10 points, and working for half a day earns 2 points, and a full day earns 10 points.
	After Shibi village implemented this three-ticket system, a new atmosphere immediately emerged. First of all, everyone is vying to labor, participate in the war, and support the army. Wang Dianhu had been assigned labor service three times in the past, but he managed to evade them all. However, after the implementation of the three-ticket system, he voluntarily requested to participate in the war. His mischievous wife also came to her senses. As soon as her husband left, she went to the village office to ask for tasks such as carrying water and planting land. Now she is hobbling around on bound feet, hoeing seedlings in the fields and carrying manure with others. She also brought back the donkey hidden at her relatives' house to exchange labor and earn points. Bai Yongmao, a notorious loafer in the village who was usually too lazy to even wash his own dishes and tied his ox to a pile of wheat straw when feeding it, has now changed. He demands to participate in the war, asks to labor, and scrambles to earn points. Shibi has thus achieved that there are people in the front to support the war, and people in the rear to be responsible for production. Secondly, the people have reorganized again, saying, "This is not a muddled group, but a fair group." 120 male laborers, accounting for 90% of the total labor force, and 145 female laborers, accounting for slightly more than 61% of the total labor force, have voluntarily joined the organization. Shi Zhenming's team also uses this method, and labor heroine Zhao Meiying has made additions. After the implementation of the three-ticket system, most women started to labor, and therefore the question was raised: "Should the earned points be given to the women themselves, or to the family!" Zhao Meiying proposed a 70/30 split, with 70% going to the family and 30% going to the women themselves. Therefore, the use of the three tickets is even more guaranteed.
	Several experiences or questions: First, according to the experience of Fushan, implementing this three-ticket system in new areas has a great effect. The masses in the new areas, under the rule of "compilation of villages," have suffered greatly from grain payments and labor services, and the three-ticket system first opposes unfairness and achieves fairness, so it is easily accepted and supported by the masses. However, they also have doubts, such as whether the travel allowance in rice is real, and who gets the travel allowance in rice, but these are quickly proven by the facts. The three-ticket system is a springboard and bridge for organizing in new areas. Using the three-ticket system creates preliminary relationships in labor, making it easier to organize. Fushan has already gained preliminary experience on how to develop from the three-ticket system to organization, mainly by cultivating key personnel and conducting the second emancipation education. In places that are not organized, the three tickets can be managed and led by the farmers' association, village office, civil affairs director, and emancipation team, and the tickets can be distributed and accounts cleared.
	Second, the three-ticket system can also be used among women, and it has actually begun. For example, women can earn work tickets for their labor, and work tickets can be exchanged for participation tickets and support-the-army tickets. On the one hand, the three tickets are issued to households, recognizing the ticket and not the person. In the future, at a certain time, women can also set "base points."
	Third, villages that already have cooperatives must vigorously support the three-ticket system and use all their strength to establish the authority of the three-ticket system, so that the three tickets can unconditionally be exchanged for grain in the cooperative, purchase various goods, and even directly exchanged for money.
	Fourth, the support-the-army ticket could originally be combined with the labor service ticket into one type, but to expand political influence, it is still listed as a separate type. Its method of use is to calculate the number of labor days required by military dependents, etc. After deducting their own labor force, tickets are issued according to the required number of labor days. The military dependents can save the support-the-army tickets and exchange them for grain or purchase goods at the cooperative.

　　石振明的三票
    金沙　陈全禄
    远在一年前，劳动英雄石振明就在他的互助大队内创造了一种三票制度——工票，参战票，优军票，用以解决参战、优军、生产上的不少困难，特别是解决参战与生产的矛盾，真正作到了两不误。但这仅仅限于组织起来的人，以后又经史壁劳动模范王宝才的发展与改进，使这票通行全村，作到百分之百的公道，大家反映道：“这是最公道的办法”。现在翼城、沁水、洪洞各村子也都采用这三票办法了。
    起初三票只能实行于已经组织起来的人，王宝才的史璧村，也曾组织过互助组，但由于变工的不公与工资不清，被群众叫为“糊涂组”，也没有人愿意再互助了，这就有了困难。可是四月间前方要人支援战争，后方又要人赶割麦子与种谷种玉茭，这就要有个两不误的办法，首先王宝才认为必须动员起全村的人来，因此必须作到公道。于是王宝才便创造了一种办法叫作“底分”。此种底分，根据各人身体强弱来评定。好比地亩负担产量的评定，将来算帐时，把全村三种工总合起来，以“底分”比例负担，畜力同样如此。此外还有一种“赚分”，赚分不跟“底分”走。王宝才村的“底分”“赚分”是这样规定的：“底分”：所有民兵，参战轮战的，每人每天负担十分；担架支差九、十分两种；运输的七、八分两种；后方组织变工及优军者四、五、六分三种，也就是除民兵外，根据劳力评定为九、十分者，必须参加担架支差，评定为七、八分者，必须参加运输，评定为四、五、六分者，必须参加后方变工，优军等工作。畜力的“底分”根据畜力大小，驮量评定。驴分十、十一、十二分三种。耕牛分二、三、四分三种。
    “赚分”：凡是民兵出外轮战，在三天内者，每人每天赚十分，三天外，增加为每天十二分，担架三天内同样十分，三天外为十一分。运输以重量远近算，担一斗米得二分半，四斗米为十分，并且规定全劳力起码四斗（以评定的底分为标准）。牲口驮八斗者，每斗以一分半算、共计十二分，多驮多加。赶驴人另加十分，牛车一牛一车者，起码拉三百斤，走一天赚十五分，加赶车人十分，共二十五分，双套单拉五百斤者，赚二十分，加两赶车人四十分，共四十五分。后方变工者以活计算，牛耕一亩地十分，人作活一晌二分，全天十分。
    史壁村实行此种三票后，立刻呈现新气象。首先所有的人争着劳动与参战、优军。王殿虎过去曾派过三次差，都设法躲过了，但在实行三票以后，自动要求参战，他调皮的老婆也想通了，男人一走，就找村公所要担水，要种地；现在扭着小脚上地锄苗，与别人合伙担粪，而且把藏在亲戚家里的毛驴，拉了回来，与人变工赚分，全村有名的二流子柏永茂，平日懒得连吃饭的碗也不想洗，喂牛的时候，把牛拴在麦秸堆上；可是现在变了，变得要求参战，要求劳动，抢着赚分。史壁就此作到了前方有人支援战争，后方有人负责生产。其次，又重新组织起来，老百姓说：“这不是糊涂组，是公道组了”。自愿结合组织起男劳力一二○人，占全劳力百分之九十，女劳力一四五人，占全劳力百分之六十一强。石振明一队也行使这个办法，而且女劳动英雄赵美英，又作了补充。在实行三票后，大部妇女劳动起来了，因此提出了问题：“所的分归妇女自己，还是归家庭！”赵美英提出七三分红办法，七分归家庭，三分归妇女自己得。因此更保证了三票的使用。
    几个经验或是问题：第一、据浮山经验，在新区实行此种三票，作用很大。新区群众在“编村”统治之下，受尽了粮款、差务的苦处，而三票首先是反不公而作到公道的，所以容易被群众接受与拥护。不过，他们也有怀疑的，如是不是真出差米，出了差米谁拿，但这些很快被事实证明了。三票是新区组织起来的跳板、桥梁。使用三票，使大家劳动上有了初步的关系，容易组织。从三票如何往组织起来发展，浮山已得出初步经验，主要培养骨干与进行第二个翻身教育。没有组织起来的地方，三票可由农会村公所民政主任翻身组等掌握与领导，分发清帐。
    第二、三票同样可以使用于妇女间，实际已开始。如妇女劳动得工票，工票与参战票优军票可以交换。一方面发三票以户为单位发的，认票不认人。将来到一定时期，妇女同样可以定“底分”。
    第三、已经有合作社的村子，必须大力扶植三票，用一切力量，建立三票的威信。作到三票可以无条件的在合作社换粮食，购买各种货物，甚至直接换钱。
    第四、优军票原可与差票为一种，但为扩大政治影响，仍列为一种。其使用法，将军属等需用工数计算后，除自己所有劳力外，按所需工数发票，军属节省下优军票，同样可换粮食，到合作社购买货物。
