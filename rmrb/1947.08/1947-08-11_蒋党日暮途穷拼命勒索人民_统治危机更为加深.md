　　Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 9th: Chiang Kai-shek, at the end of his rope, desperately extorts the people to supply the civil war, which only serves to deepen his crisis of rule. Even within the Chiang party, this cannot be denied. According to a Central Telegraph report: at the end of last month, during the opening of the Chiang government's "Grain Conference," Chiang's Supervisory Committee member Xiang Naiqi and others presented a suggestion, supporting the reactionary grain requisition quotas exceeding the total income of households, stating: "Regarding the matter of verifying grades, the so-called burden must not exceed the productive capacity." The suggestion also revealed: "Those with lighter burdens are mostly wealthy families, big landlords, while those with heavier burdens are mostly middle and lower classes of small landlords, owner-farmers, and semi-owner-farmers. Therefore, in recent years, land has become increasingly concentrated, and those who have lost their livelihoods have increased." They lamented: "What the government relies on as 'funds for suppressing bandits' will become an indirect cause of 'creating bandits.'"
　　Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 9th: According to recent news from the Chiang-controlled areas of Beiping, Zhangjiakou, and other places newspapers, the central and western parts of Suiyuan Province, and the Ikezhao League south of the Hetao region, under the tyrannical rule of Fu Zuoyi, are suffering from floods, locust plagues, and hailstorms. On the evening of the 6th of last month, the Dahei River in Tuoketuo County (located southwest of Gui Sui) breached its banks for three hundred zhang, and all the autumn fields along the river were flooded. In Sui West, the large and small canal outlets in Wuyuan, Linhe (both within the Hetao area), and Baotou, etc., were also mostly breached by floods. In addition, locust plagues and hailstorms were widespread, turning thousands of miles of fertile land into desert, and millions of starving people were crying for food. It is said that this area also suffered from famine at this time last year, and the outbreak of the great flood was unprecedented in ten years. This year's recurrence of the disaster makes the people's suffering unimaginable. However, Fu Zuoyi has never relaxed the conscription of soldiers and grain in this area for the past year. Seven or eight out of ten of the crops harvested by farmers in the famous grain-producing counties of Wuyuan and Linhe have been seized under various names such as "actual levy," "compulsory loan," and "provincial and county public grain." A farmer surnamed Ma in Wuyuan harvested six dou of materials, but his burden reached six shi. On the other hand, many elderly people have also been arrested, and there is no one to produce in vast areas, let alone repair canals and build dikes, so floods have occurred. At this moment, the people are being forced to rise up and save themselves. Grain robbery incidents have occurred repeatedly in Wuyuan and Sarachi and other places. In Wuyuan, thousands of starving people are currently robbing three grain stores. The Fu authorities suppressed the riots with armed force but were ineffective. The starving people shouted: "We can't tighten our belts and wait to die!"

　　蒋党日暮途穷拼命勒索人民
  　统治危机更为加深
    【新华社陕北九日电】蒋介石日暮穷途拚命勒索人民供应内战之结果，适足加深其统治危机，此事即令蒋党内部也不能否认。据中央电讯：上月底蒋政府“粮食会议”开幕时，蒋家监察委员向乃祺等会上一建议书，支持反动的征粮数额超过民家收入总数称：“关于核定等则一事，其所谓负担，切不可超过生产力。”该书并透露：“人民负担轻者多系豪门巨室、大地主，重者多为小地主、自耕农及半自耕农之中下阶层。故近年来土地愈趋集中，丧失本业者日见加多。”彼等哀叫：“将见政府恃以为‘平匪’之资者，适成为‘造匪’之间接原因。”
    【新华社陕北九日电】据最近北平、张家口等地蒋管区报纸消息，傅作义暴政统治下的绥远省中部、西部、及河套以南伊克昭盟一带，正遭受水灾、蝗灾及雹灾的袭击。上月六日晚，托克托（位于归绥西南方）县境内之大黑河，决堤三百丈长，沿河秋田全被淹没。绥西之五原、临河（均为河套区内）及包头等地，大小渠口亦多被洪水冲破。加以蝗灾雹灾普遍各地，致使千里沃野变为荒漠，千万饥民嗷嗷待哺。据称此地区去年此时亦遭灾荒，暴发之大水，为十年来所未有。今年再度受灾，人民之苦可以想见。然傅贼一年来在该地区对征兵征粮从未放松。著名产粮区五原、临河两县农民收获物，十分之七、八已在“征实”“征借”“省县公粮”等各种名目下被搜刮去。五原一马姓农民收获物资六斗，而负担竟达六石。另一方面，许多老年亦被抓走，广大地区无人生产，更谈不上修渠筑堤，水灾遂因而发生。刻人民正被逼起而自救，五原及萨拉齐等地，已迭次发生抢米事件。五原于目前有上千饥民抢劫三座粮店，傅当局以武装弹压无效饥民高呼：“我们不能勒紧裤带等死！”
