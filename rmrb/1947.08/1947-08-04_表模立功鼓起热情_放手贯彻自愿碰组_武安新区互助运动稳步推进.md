    [This Newspaper Special Dispatch] After resolving some twists and turns and concrete difficulties through effort, the movement to get organized for production and prosperity in Wu'an New District has made considerable progress. Mutual aid is moving from "breaking the organization and voluntary association" towards "breaking through personal considerations, recording work and converting labor, and planning flexibly." The path experienced by the county can be roughly divided into two major steps. When production was first organized in mid-May, the emphasis was generally on stimulating production enthusiasm and preliminary organization was widespread. At that time, there were many difficulties: first, many village cadres whose relationship with the masses had not been straightened out had negative emotions. Second, uneven rainfall made it impossible to arrange a unified campaign. Before production could be organized, the task of surviving the drought arrived. Third, large-scale participation in the war. In response to the first problem, a large-scale campaign to establish merit and commend model workers was launched throughout the county. Cadres were praised for their contributions, both large and small, over the past two years (in the old areas, even contributions from the eight-year War of Resistance were retroactively recognized), and batches of diligent, prosperous, and technically skilled individuals were commended. As a result, many leading cadres and activists who had turned over began to change their attitudes and were determined to take the lead in making contributions to production. The branches all set merit-making plans. In response to the second problem, county and district cadres went deep into various base points and villages to arrange and organize planting or rush planting and weeding according to the situation. These were all good. However, because the task of participating in the war was large at that time, most areas adopted a simple method of organizing mutual aid to ensure the proper cultivation of land for families participating in the war and military dependents, implementing "four stops and three cares." This was a detour that led the masses to mistakenly believe that mutual aid meant plowing on behalf of others. After the completion of participation in the war in June, most of these groups collapsed immediately. The few that did not collapse were all voluntarily formed (such as some mutual aid groups of immigrants from the old areas in the third and eighth districts). After reviewing this detour, the county and district held a meeting in mid-June and began the second step: universally implementing the breaking of organization and thoroughly re-establishing voluntary association. This process also encountered and overcame some difficulties: first, the concern of village cadres that voluntary association would not be possible or that those who voluntarily joined would not have enough labor to cultivate the land. The latter concern was fundamental, and the leadership decided to "organize first," and the implementation turned out well (as proven by Chongyi). Second, the problem of outstanding work debts left over from the mutual aid in the previous year was quickly cleared up (such as in Nanhezhuang). In this way, genuine mutual aid began to take shape. According to reports from the tenth district, most villages have voluntarily joined together, and the scale of organization is quite large: Liugangxi Village has 34 agricultural groups with 275 people; Hu Village has 20 groups with 329 people; and He Village has 36 groups with 433 people. These groups include most of the labor force. Statistics from 20 villages show that 79 groups have implemented work recording and labor conversion, and are planning to work flexibly. Each day, households report their available work or spare labor, and the group leader jointly allocates manpower to do work according to the plan, records work, and 80 lazy individuals have been reformed. In the eighth district, voluntary mutual aid generally takes three forms: one is mutual aid by households with men, women, old and young; the second is mutual aid among single men, who find orphans and widows to cook for the collective; and the third is voluntary combination of households with only female labor and orphans or elderly men with insufficient labor but technical skills. The masses in Yehe and other four villages have almost all been organized and are implementing work recording and labor conversion. Generally speaking, the whole county is still in a lower stage of mutual aid, characterized by soldier against soldier, general against general, with the labor force of each household in a group being roughly equal. Work is exchanged for work, and borrowing and repaying labor is very fast. The masses feel that detailed work recording and labor conversion and a work ticket system are not needed. However, the masses feel that the efficiency of work has improved compared to before, it is lively and fast to work, and many difficulties have been solved. Many groups have combined agriculture and sideline occupations, and often take turns squeezing out people to "pick up and chop," increasing income significantly. This combination is still in a low-level state and cannot be consolidated for a long time, but it will continue to develop and improve with the in-depth leadership of cadres and the dissemination of experience from the old areas. The county party committee has recently called on district cadres to go deep into leadership, create typical groups; universally promote work recording and labor conversion, and plan to work flexibly to consolidate and improve mutual aid; overcome the method of "all work through mutual aid groups" in some villages, so as not to trouble the masses; and take the branch as the core, with all party members entering mutual aid groups to actively promote it. The branch establishes a merit system and regularly commends models. The enthusiasm of party members and the masses is generally high. (And Dong)

    [This Newspaper News] After deploying large-scale production in Songjiazhuang Village, Gaoyi, the village used administrative orders to organize the entire village into a large mutual aid organization. The villagers were dissatisfied with this kind of mutual aid because the labor evaluation was not seriously done and the cadres could not lead because their work style was not democratic and the villagers did not give feedback to the cadres. As ×× said: "My own livestock cannot cultivate my own land. If this goes on, not only will we not get rich, but we will become poor." Soon the large mutual aid collapsed. After the cadres researched the reasons for the collapse, they determined that the first reason was that the leadership was not democratic, and the large mutual aid was organized by administrative orders. The second reason was that the labor evaluation was unfair. After everyone made a self-criticism, they decided to reorganize, proposing that mutual aid be based on voluntary association, labor conversion be based on equal value and democratic discussion, and mutual aid be mutually beneficial. After mobilization, 39 groups were voluntarily formed, and only two of the 70 households in the village did not participate. Thirty-five male laborers, 30 female laborers, and all 18 draft animals in the village participated in mutual aid. Now, except for one group that has not seriously implemented equal value exchange, the rest are doing well. In addition to participating in agricultural labor, the women also organized eight spinning groups and spin cotton when they have time. The leading role of cadres has also been brought into play. After the recent rainfall, village head Li Qingyu led a group to cultivate 13 mu of land in one morning. Acting Armed Forces Committee Director Jia Ni first cultivated land for others in the group, and his land was cultivated last. Because the militiamen were tired from cultivating the land, they were unwilling to go outside for activities at night. When the village head and instructor learned about this, they personally went to bury landmines and conduct activities outside. Under their influence, other militiamen also automatically went out for activities and did not complain of fatigue. (Jixi People's Daily)

### 表模立功鼓起热情  放手贯彻自愿碰组  武安新区互助运动稳步推进

    表模立功鼓起热情
    放手贯彻自愿碰组
    武安新区互助运动稳步推进
    【本报特讯】经过一些曲折道路与具体困难的努力解决，武安新区的组织起来生产发家运动已获不少进展。互助正由“打破编制、自愿结合”走向“打破情面、记工折工、计划做活”。该县经历的道路，大体说来是两大步。五月半开始组织生产时，一般着重于激励生产热情，普遍的初步组织起来。当时曾有不少困难：一是调整干群关系时不少未整通的村干部有消极情绪。第二是雨水不匀，不普遍，无法统一布置一个运动。生产还未组织起来，又随着天旱来了渡荒任务。第三、大参战。针对第一个问题，全县开展了大规模立功表模运动。将干部二年来大小功劳集中表扬（老区当时连八年抗战中的功劳也补了），勤劳发家的、节约的、有技术的，一批批表扬，这样，许多领导翻身的干部积极分子开始转变了情绪，下决心在生产中带头立功，支部都订了立功计划。针对第二个问题，县区干部分别深入各基点与村庄，按情况布置与组织点种或抢种、锄苗等。这些都是好的。但因当时参战任务大，大部地区为保证种好参战群众与军属土地，采取了简单的编制互助办法，实行“四停三照顾”。这是一段弯路，使群众误认互助即是代耕。六月参战毕，马上都垮了，少数未垮的，都是自愿结合起来的（如三、八区一部分老区移民的互助组）。县区检讨了这段弯路，即于六月半会议后开始了第二步：普遍实行打破编制，重新彻底自愿结合。这中间也曾遭遇与克服了一些困难：一是解除村干怕自愿不起来或自愿起来无劳力的种不上的顾虑。后一顾虑是基本的，领导上决定“组织起来再说”，贯彻下去结果还好（崇义即是证明）。二是去年一度互助中遗留的欠工问题，迅速清理（如南贺庄）。这样，真正的互助开始形成。十区汇报，大部村庄均已自愿结合起来，组织规模颇大：刘岗西村农业组三十四个，二七五人；胡村廿组，三二九人；和村三十六组，四三三人。均包括了大部劳力。廿村统计，已有七十九组实行记工折工，计划做活。每天由各户自报活计或余工，与组长共同分配人力，按计划做活，记工，并有八十个懒汉懒妇获得改造。八区的自愿互助大体有三种：一是以户为单位男女老少齐互助；二是光棍汉互助，找孤寡给集体做饭；三是光有女劳力的户自愿结合，并与劳力不足、但有技术的孤老汉结合。野河等四村群众几已全部组织起来，实行了记工折工。全县大部说来，现在还在较低级的互助阶段，特点是兵对兵，将对将，一组内各户劳力大体相平。工顶工，借工还工很快，详细的记工折工与工票制度群众觉得不需要。但在做活效率上群众都觉得比以前提高了，干起来热闹，快，并解决了许多困难。其中不少组实行了农副业结合，时常轮流挤出人去“拾砍”，增加不少收入。这种结合还在低级状态，不可能长期巩固，但在干部深入领导与传播老区经验中将不断发展提高。县委最近正号召区干深入领导，创造典型组；普遍推广记工折工，计划做活，巩固与提高互助；克服部分村庄“一切工作通过互助组”的办法，免使群众感到麻烦；以支部为核心，所有党员进互助组去积极推动。支部建立记功制，经常表扬模范。党员与群众热情一般很高。（而东）
    【本报讯】高邑宋家庄村在布置大生产以后，用行政命令编的办法，组织了全村大互助，折工评分没有认真搞，群众对这样互助不满意，干部虽然带头生产，但是领导不起来，因为干部作风不民主，群众也不向干部反映意见。如××说：“我自己的牲口不能种自己的地，像这样下去不但过不富，倒要过穷了。”不久大互助垮了，干部研究垮的原因，首先是领导不民主，行政命令搞起来的大互助，其次折工评分搞的不公道。大家作了检讨以后，决定重新组织，提出互助自愿结合，折工等价民主讨论，互助互利两不吃亏，经过动员后，自愿结合了三十九个小组，全村七十户，只有两户没参加。组织起男劳力三十五人，女劳力三十人，全村十八犋牲口全部参加互助，现在除一个组没有认真实行等价交换外，其余都作的很好。妇女们除参加农业劳动外，还组织了八个纺织小组，有空就纺花。干部的带头作用也发挥了，村长李庆玉在这次下雨后，带领一个组一上午种地十三亩。代理武委会主任贾妮在组内首先给别人种地，他的地最后种。民兵因种地疲劳，晚上不愿到外边活动，村长指导员知道了，就亲自去埋地雷，到外边活动。在他们影响下别的民兵亦自动外出活动，不说疲劳了。（冀西民报）
