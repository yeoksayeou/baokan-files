Xinhua News Agency, Jinji-Luyu, 28th. The powerful Taiyue militia launched a military and political offensive against the enemy's Second Security Regiment, which had been besieged in Yuanqu city for a long time. Fearing annihilation, the enemy fled to the south bank of the Yellow River on the morning of the 24th, and the area was recovered by the militia.

This newspaper's Taiyue dispatch, 27th. The militias of Hongtong and Linfen counties are intensifying their encirclement of Linfen city. After the summary meeting on the 22nd of last month, in addition to laying mines around the city, they also actively attacked the enemy with rotating battle teams. On the 30th of last month, more than 60 bandits from Dongxi Sucun and Qucun went to Tianjing and Beiyang to loot grain. Shang Qingfu's demolition team and the rotating battle team rushed to meet them head-on and pursued them to Tianjing, where they triggered a landmine. They retreated in panic and were wounded two more outside the village. Since then, the enemy has been trapped in their strongholds. On the 6th, seven plainclothes men were sent to Yancun for reconnaissance and were completely captured by us, with two pistols seized. Gao Fa Hong and others crossed the Fen River to Wucun Town on the night of the 8th, capturing four people including the village chief, and seizing two silver mares and two donkeys. On the 15th, with swift action, they broke into Gou Shang village, which was full of bunkers, and captured Wei Yunchang, a tyrant landlord from Fushan, and others, seizing a donkey. In the past ten days, a total of 24 enemies have been killed or wounded.

This newspaper's Taiyue dispatch, 27th. The Jiexiu militia, under the principle of "the enemy advances, we advance," launched a struggle to protect grain and conscription. From July 20th to August 5th, in half a month, they continuously repelled more than ten attacks by Yan's army to seize grain, killing, wounding, and capturing 20 enemies, seizing two rifles, and recovering more than 700 catties of grain. The larger battle was on July 21st, when the Third District Detachment and the Geduo militia annihilated 14 members of the enemy security team in Geduo. Qiao Degong, a first-class hero in killing the enemy, even went to the ditch fort two miles away from Yian Railway Station and captured an enemy soldier alive, seizing a rifle. Under our active operations, more and more enemies are deserting. On the 30th, a soldier of Yan's army deserted, bringing with him a rifle and 95 rounds of ammunition, to surrender to the liberated area.

This newspaper's Taiyue dispatch, 27th. The militia of the Third District of Tunliu launched a meritorious service campaign in training. Although the time was short, they had initially learned military knowledge such as grenade throwing, aiming, and bayonet practice. Four people could throw grenades accurately beyond 40 meters, 16 people could throw accurately beyond 30 meters, and 77 people could throw grenades at a normal distance of 15 meters. More than 200 people learned aiming. Zhang Pan'er, Cui Zhufa, Ren Suwen, and others did not take a nap, or taught others repeatedly in the moonlight in the middle of the night. Li Yinwang, Xi'er, Hou Yutang, and others, in addition to learning various techniques step by step, also used their nap time to help the masses hoe seedlings. The whole training adopted the method of combining learning and doing. In a marching exercise, a major curfew was carried out in eight villages, drugs were found, and the government awarded 50,000 yuan. Politically, everyone thought about the past and compared it with the present. Each group carried out accusations of suffering. Zhang Deben, from Yuwu, was a barber. During his accusation of suffering, he talked about working and begging at the age of twelve, his tears flowing, crying incessantly, making everyone clear that the militia is the armed force of the peasants. They all said: "If we don't defeat Chiang Kai-shek, we can't protect our fruits." After the meeting, 73 learning models such as Zhang Dezhao were selected, and challenges were made between villages and people, guaranteeing that they would be able to mobilize as soon as orders came.
