　　To Block the Landlord Class's "Air Raid Shelter"
  　Taiyue District Party Committee Makes Four Decisions
    [This newspaper, Taiyue, 9th dispatch] In order to block the "air raid shelter" of the landlord class and thoroughly complete land reform, the District Party Committee here has made four decisions, which are excerpted as follows: (1) All Party members and cadres of landlord origin should take the lead in writing to their families, voluntarily handing over land and property to meet the legitimate demands of the masses, and should not emphasize taking care of their families. Taking care must be based on the voluntary will of the masses, and requesting care themselves is wrong. (2) All organs, troops, and all production departments must immediately and conscientiously conduct a thorough investigation of their internal composition, resolutely cleanse all targets of struggle, and send them to the local county, district, and village farmers' associations for processing. Otherwise, once discovered, the head of the direct unit should be severely punished. (3) Deep education on the Party's land reform policy should be carried out in the army. If a few elements dare to use armed force to interfere with the mass movement, the masses have the right to disarm them and send them to the District Party Committee for processing. (4) Party members and cadres are strictly prohibited from marrying landlords' women or daughters. Those who are already married should be strictly investigated for political problems. If there are any, forced divorce can be enforced.

　　为堵塞地主阶级“防空洞”
  　太岳区党委作四项决定
    【本报太岳九日电】此间区党委为堵塞地主阶级的“防空洞”，彻底完成土改，特作四项决定，现摘录如下：（一）一切地主出身的党员、干部，首应以身作则，给自己家庭写信，自动拿出土地财产，以满足群众之正当要求，不应强调对自己家庭的照顾，照顾必须出于群众自愿，自己要求照顾是错误的。（二）各机关部队与一切生产部门，必须即刻认真将自己内部成份作一彻底清查，坚决清洗一切斗争对象，送交当地县、区、村农会处理，否则一经发现，其直接单位首长应受严重处分。（三）在部队中应深刻进行党的土改政策教育，如有少数分子敢于利用武装干涉群众运动，群众有权解除其武装，并送交区党委处理。（四）严禁党员干部与地主之女人、女儿结婚，已结婚者应严格审查其有无政治问题，如有则可强制离婚。
