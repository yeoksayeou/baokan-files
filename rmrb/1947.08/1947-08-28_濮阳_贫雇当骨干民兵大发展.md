　　Poor and Hired Peasants as Backbone, Militia Greatly Developed
　　[This newspaper's report from the Hebei-Shandong-Henan Border Region, 26th] After three or four months of re-examination movement, the militia in Puyang County has achieved great development. The reasons for this development are: (1) The Party's land reform re-examination policy was thoroughly implemented, and the peasants truly turned themselves over, consciously having the demand to protect the land and lives by expanding the armed forces. At the same time, the leadership also paid timely attention to developing the organization. (2) The leadership's emphasis on the work of the people's armed forces can be seen from the allocation of cadres. The cadres of the county and district Armed Forces Committees are uniformly allocated by the Party Committee. In the development of the militia, the main point is to establish poor peasant leadership backbone in the militia and strengthen class education. Most of the old militia members participated during the Anti-Japanese War, with complex compositions and impure motivations. Coupled with insufficient class education, this created opportunities for landlords and special agents to sabotage. After this re-examination, the thinking was clarified, and it was recognized that to make the militia truly become the peasants' class armed force, the poor peasant leadership backbone should be established in the militia first. Grasp the militia's locality and dispersion without separating from production, strengthen class education, and improve the awareness of new and old militia members, making them truly become the beloved class armed force of the masses.

　　濮阳
  　贫雇当骨干民兵大发展
    【本报冀鲁豫二十六日电】濮阳县经过三四个月的复查运动，民兵获得很大发展。发展的原因：（一）彻底执行了党的土改复查政策，农民真正翻了身，自觉的有了保田保命扩大的武装要求。同时领导上也及时注意发展组织。（二）领导上对人民武装工作的重视，从干部的配备上可以看出，县区武委会干部均由党委统一配备，在发展民兵中，其主要是在民兵中树立贫农领导骨干，加强阶级教育。过去的老民兵大部是抗日时期参加的，成份复杂，参加动机不纯，再加上阶级教育不够、造成了地主特务破坏的机会。经过这次复查，明确了思想，认识到要使民兵真正成为农民的阶级武装，首先应在民兵中树立贫农领导骨干，掌握民兵不脱离生产的地方性与分散性，加强阶级教育，提高新老民兵的觉悟程度，使其真正成为群众的爱戴的阶级武装。
