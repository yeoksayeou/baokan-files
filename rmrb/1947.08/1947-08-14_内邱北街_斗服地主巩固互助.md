　　Neiqiu North Street
  　Struggle Against Landlords to Consolidate Mutual Aid
    [This Newspaper] Neiqiu North Street, while rectifying mutual aid, discovered that landlords were sabotaging it from within and hindering mass production. Immediately, a re-examination and struggle were launched, and twenty-six households of feudal forces completely bowed their heads. The peasants, according to the principle of equivalent value and voluntariness, reorganized the mutual aid teams and cleared up wages. They are now making a concentrated effort on the second weeding. After the street shifted to production, due to the ideological paralysis of cadres and the masses, some who had been struggled against were even elected as team leaders. They seized upon the cadres' and masses' mentality of luck and paralysis, carrying out organized sabotage in every production season, and several resolutions were ineffective. After the rush planting, the leadership seized the opportunity to reorganize mutual aid and prepared to make a concentrated effort on weeding. The Production Committee discussed and decided on rectification methods, but they were still ineffective when implemented. Cadres, by sitting in on group meetings, discovered that landlords were arrogant and威风发威 (exerting their authority), such as Tian Changqiu and Qiu Eryang, who threatened the peasants into silence. Hao Dengxiao, Qiao Guobing, and others still emphasized being provided with meals. This phenomenon was discovered in each group, which aroused the vigilance of the cadres. After a meeting and self-criticism, it was unanimously believed that in the past (after the shift to production), the class line was not clear enough, and supervision and management of the feudal forces had been relaxed. It was decided to immediately convene peasant family meetings for discussion and deliberation. It was discovered that Qiao Guobing and Qiu Eryang were not only engaged in sabotage in production, but Qiao Guobing, regarding the houses allocated to the liberated households, did not vacate the houses despite repeated urgings. Hao San’s family was engaged in sabotage everywhere and asked the liberated peasants to return land. Qiu Yuqun cursed cadres and defrauded Su Xiaozhen of the fruits of struggle, and Su Jingkui refused to let Su Xiaozhen move the trestle table that was allocated to her, etc., which aroused the anger of every member of the masses. They unanimously proposed, "If they are not convinced, we will struggle again. Even if they grow wings, we will twist them off." That evening, a mass meeting was convened to re-examine and re-struggle against all twenty-six households of feudal forces in the village. The emotions of the masses exceeded the highest tide of the Great Movement. Li Gen, Hao Xiaowu, Zhang Huanjing, and others, who had never spoken out in the past, became the most active backbones this time. They said everything they had to say, truly demonstrating the mighty and great power of the great unity of the peasants after liberation. Those who had been targets of struggle bowed their heads and confessed to the masses, setting out conditions for the future. After the trial, the peasants proposed: this time, we will thoroughly draw a clear line with the landlords ideologically, and we will struggle whenever they are not convinced. After removing the obstacles to production, mutual aid was reorganized, and the wages of the previous stage were cleared. The large groups were voluntarily reorganized by the masses into eighteen small groups, resolutely implementing equivalent value, and various systems were established. Now the whole village has become active, and is making a concentrated effort on the second weeding, and rushing to plant buckwheat and vegetables.
