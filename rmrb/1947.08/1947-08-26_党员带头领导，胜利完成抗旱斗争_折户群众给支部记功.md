　　Party Members Take the Lead, Victoriously Completing the Fight Against Drought
　　Zhehu Villagers Credit the Branch
[Our Newspaper Reporter Team, 24th Dispatch] The villagers of Zhehu Village, Xingtai Ninth District, recently, in carrying out the production inspection and crop comparison movement, clearly saw that the victory in the four-month fight against drought and preparation for famine was mainly due to the good leadership of the Communist Party branch. The whole village unanimously decided to credit the branch and exemplary party members Li Shunhua, Yao Dezeng, Yao Deai, Yao Dekai, and other comrades. In April, before it had rained, Li Shunhua, the county labor hero and branch secretary, convened a branch meeting to study: "Now is the time to plant cotton. If we don't plant now, we won't be able to. What should we do?" Yao Dezeng, a Communist Party member and first-class cooperative hero in the Taihang District, immediately suggested that the masses should be organized to carry water to plant. It was decided on the spot that he would plant first and mobilize party members to take the lead to resolutely complete the plan to plant one hundred and sixty mu of cotton. The next day, after mobilizing all party members through a team leader meeting, Li Shunhua's team took the lead, and the whole village responded. Within three days, the whole village carried water to plant 130 mu of cotton in dry land and 28 mu in irrigated land, completing the plan. In addition, water was carried to plant 130 mu of peanuts and 24 mu of Golden Queen corn. In May, the cotton had been hoed for the first time, and the work quickly shifted to accumulating fertilizer and preparing for the wheat harvest. At that time, because it hadn't rained, the cotton was so dry that it curled up during the day, and some had begun to die. Yao Dekai, an exemplary elementary school teacher and party member, organized sixty-two male and female students into six groups to carry water to water the cotton. In five days, the cotton was watered and hoed once, saving the seedlings. Immediately afterward, the branch, based on the spirit of the county party committee, proposed "Harvest as the wheat ripens, plant as the land is shaded"; and based on the village's water conditions, decided to plan shady planting before harvesting the wheat. After discussion at the team leader meeting, the following slogans were put forward: "Wheat is most afraid of hail, harvest as it ripens, men, women, old and young work together, strive to complete the harvest in five days," "Quickly irrigate the fields if there is water, people and livestock should not be idle," and competitions were launched between teams. Although school was out for the summer, Comrade Yao Dekai still organized the children. Sixty-seven people harvested 104 mu of wheat in four and a half days. Li Shunhua's team had many old people and weak labor. On the morning of June 12, eight women were organized to go to the fields to harvest wheat, and six children were brought to the fields to be watched by the older children. In the afternoon, they threshed the grain. Men and women worked together, completing a day and a half's work in one day, and harvesting the village's wheat in five days, also seizing the time to plant ninety-one mu of autumn crops. The rest of the land was planted by shady planting and spot planting, and most of the village's land was planted within ten days. After planting in the irrigated land, weeding and spot planting were combined for the dry land. The seedlings that came out couldn't withstand the drought later, and the masses reflected: "Happy to see in the morning, disappointed to see at noon!" Carrying water to plant stopped, and everyone's morale was low. The branch immediately held a meeting to discuss the matter. Village head Comrade Yao Deai said: "I planted one mu of land, and I have to pay twenty catties of wheat as wages. If I have to water and weed again, it's not worth it!" Other comrades also felt that the wage of five catties of wheat a day was too high. Therefore, it was decided in principle to reduce wages and exchange labor as much as possible. After mobilization and research by the cadre team leader meeting, it was specifically stipulated that the wage would be reduced to three catties and two taels of corn. Comrade Yao Deai said: "In the past, the wages were high and no one planted. Now that the wages are low, I will take the lead in planting for others first." The cadre team leaders heard this and said, "We also want to be role models!" The next day, the whole village got up early and rang the bell to unify their actions. Carrying water to plant, water the seedlings, and weeding started again in a vigorous manner. By July 15, of the village's 611 mu of dry land, about 540 mu had taken root. From carrying water to plant flowers in April to carrying water to plant and protect seedlings in July, the masses of Zhehu Village have basically achieved victory in the four-month fight against drought. After inspection, the masses thought about the source of the water and felt that it was all the result of the leadership of the Communist Party and everyone's efforts. On the one hand, the masses voluntarily gave credit to the branch and these exemplary party members, and at the same time, they inspired everyone's courage and confidence to fight against the disaster and drought for a long time.

　　党员带头领导，胜利完成抗旱斗争
  　折户群众给支部记功
    【本报记者团二十四电】邢台九区折户村群众，最近在开展生产检查比庄稼运动中，看清四个月抗旱备荒获胜，主要是共产党支部领导的好，全村一致决议给支部及模范党员李顺华、姚德增、姚德爱、姚德凯等同志记功。四月间天还没下雨，全县劳动英雄——支部书记李顺华同志，就召集支干会研究：“现在已是种棉花的时候，再不种就种不上了，看怎么办？”太行区一等合作英雄——共产党员姚德增立即提出应赶快组织群众担水点种，当场决定了自己先点，并动员党员带头，坚决完成种一百六十亩花的计划。第二天又经过组长会动员全体党员，李顺华组先带头，全村响应，三天内全村往旱地担水点种花一百三十亩、水地种了二十八亩，完成了计划。另外还担水种了一百三十亩花生、二十四亩金皇后玉茭。五月里，棉花就锄过了头遍，及早转入换炕积肥做麦收准备工作。那时因天还未下雨，棉花旱的白天都卷曲，有的已开始死了。模范小学教员党员姚德凯同志，就把六十二个男女学生组织了六个小组，担水浇花，五天内把花都浇了一遍锄了一遍，才算把花苗救活了。紧接着，支部又根据县委会的精神，提出“麦子熟一片割一片，地阴一片种一片”；并根据全村水的情况，决定在割麦前就要有计划的阴地。后经组长会研究，提出：“麦子最怕雹打，要熟一把割一把，男女老少齐动手，争取五天收割罢”，“有水快阴田，人水牲口都不闲”等口号，发动组与组进行竞赛。小学虽放了假，姚德凯同志仍把儿童组织起来。六十七个人，四天半割麦一百零四亩。李顺华组老头多，劳力弱，在六月十二日上午，组织了八个妇女下地割麦，把六个小孩也引到地里，由大小孩看，下午打场，男女齐下手，一天赶了天半活，五天收割完全村的麦子，还趁晌抢种了九十一亩秋。其余的地都是阴种、点种的，十天全村大部土地都下了籽。水地下种后又结合锄苗，点种旱地。出来的苗，后来又旱的顶不住，群众反映：“清早到地看还高兴，晌午看就扫兴！”担水点种停止了，大家情绪很低。支部立即开会研究，村长姚德爱同志说：“我点种了一亩地，就得出二十斤麦子的工资，要再浇苗锄苗，就不上算！”其他同志也都有一天五斤麦子的工资太高的感觉，于是原则上确定了减低工资，尽量工换工，又经过干部组长会动员研究，具体规定工资减成三斤二两玉茭，姚德爱同志说：“过去工资高没人点种，这一下工资低了，我带头先给别人点种。”干部组长听了，都说：“俺也要起模范！”第二天全村早起打钟，统一行动，担水点种、浇苗、锄苗又轰轰烈烈的行动起来，到七月十五日前，全村六百一十一亩旱地约有五百四十亩捉住了苗。从四月开始担水种花到七月里担水点种和保苗，连续四个月的抗旱斗争，折户村群众基本上已取得胜利。群众经过检查，饮水思源，觉得全凭共产党领导和大家努力的结果，群众一方面自动给支部和这些模范党员立功，同时更激励起大家与灾旱作长期斗争的勇气与信心。（安祥）
