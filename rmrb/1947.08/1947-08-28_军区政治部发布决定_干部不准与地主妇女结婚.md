Military Region Political Department Issues Decision
  Cadres Forbidden to Marry Landlord Women

[This newspaper's report] Since the Japanese devils surrendered, the number of cadre marriages in the troops has increased. However, some cadres have been careless in choosing their partners, and political organs have not given careful consideration during the approval process, resulting in some marrying the daughters of landlords or their divorced daughters-in-law. This has blurred class consciousness, even to the point of losing their class stance, providing cover for the targets of struggle, and turning into "air-raid shelters" for landlords. Some, under the guise of "taking care of military dependents," have directly or indirectly opposed land reform, even engaging in "retaliatory" activities and oppressing farmers. Others marry women with serious illnesses, affecting their health. In order to overcome these adverse phenomena, the Political Department of the Jin-Ji-Lu-Yu Military Region has made the following decision:

1.  All cadres are strictly forbidden from marrying the daughters of struggle targets (landlords, bullies, local tyrants, and evil gentry, etc.) or their divorced daughters-in-law, as well as women who belonged to the puppet regime. Comrades in Party committees and political organs at all levels, especially those in the organization departments, must be even more clear about this concept when considering and handling marriage issues. Women of struggle target backgrounds or puppet regime affiliation who have joined the army or reside in our military schools are also strictly forbidden from marrying cadres unless their ideology has been transformed and they have abandoned their original class stance. Those who are already married should be strictly investigated for political problems, and forced divorce may be implemented if such problems exist. From the date of issuance of this decision, those who violate this rule will have themselves and the approving organs held accountable.

2.  All cadres are strictly forbidden from marrying those suffering from syphilis, venereal disease, or contagious diseases related to syphilis. If marriage is permissible, both parties must undergo a medical examination by the health department, with the person in charge signing and sealing the examination report as evidence. It must then be approved by the organization departments of the Party committees and political organs at all levels.

　　军区政治部发布决定
  　干部不准与地主妇女结婚
    【本报讯】日寇投降以来，部队干部结婚日多，而某些干部由于选择对象不慎及政治机关批准时考虑不周，致有的和地主女儿或其离婚媳妇结婚，模糊了阶级观念，甚或丧失阶级立场，为斗争对象打掩护，变成地主“防空洞”。有的借“照顾军属”，正面侧面直接间接的反对土地改革，甚至进行“倒算”活动，压迫农民。有的与有恶疾女人结婚，影响身体。晋冀鲁豫军区政治部，为克服此种恶劣现象，特作如下决定：一、全体干部一律不准与斗争对象（地主恶霸土豪劣绅等）的女儿或其离婚媳妇及伪属女人结婚，各级党委政治机关特别是组织部门同志，在考虑处理婚姻问题时，思想上更要明确这个观念。已入伍的或住我军学校的斗争对象成份的女子或伪属，其思想上如未改造，还未抛弃其原来阶级立场时，亦一律不准与其结婚。已结婚者应严格审查有无政治问题，如有则可强制其离婚。自该决定发布之日起，再有此种情事发生，要追究本人与批准机关责任。二、全体干部一律不准与患有梅毒暗疾或带有梅毒性的传染性病者结婚。如可结婚，双方均须经过卫生部门检查，负责人签名盖章，作为检查证据。再经各级党委政治机关组织部门批准。
