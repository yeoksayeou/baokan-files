Ren Village Rectification Mutual Aid Society
Expels Six Landlords
[Our newspaper’s report from Lin County] The masses of Ren Village in Lin County, during their frugality and drought preparation efforts, discovered that many landlords had infiltrated the masses' mutual aid societies, eating and drinking extravagantly, growing fat and lazy, and not helping the masses with production. They said, "It's okay if we make money, but if we lose money, people will beat us." They tried every means possible to seize every opportunity to spread rumors and sabotage. When the government called for drought prevention, the landlord XXX said to the masses, "We don't have land anymore, should it rain a little for you? But the heavens just won't send it down." When everyone discussed saving money by not visiting relatives, Yue Wulun, a landlord from the first street, insisted on having his relatives come early to celebrate the anniversary of his death, resulting in the masses finding more than two shi of grain in his house. During transportation, Su Guangling, a landlord from the fourth street, deliberately broke the legs of the farmers' livestock. Even more malicious acts included landlord Su Kerang setting fire to the masses' houses, Zhang Wenzhi demolishing farmers' gate towers, Su Laojing sawing down the Farmers' Association's trees, doing false accounting, and inciting disunity among the mutual aid groups, among other destructive activities. On the evening of the 23rd, after careful deliberation and discussion, the masses unanimously said, "We have been emancipated, who among us eats as well as those landlords, taking the people's money, sitting in the mutual aid society, acting as big managers and chief accountants! Still arrogant and complacent, only eating and not working." Finally, everyone discussed whether the mutual aid society could function without the landlords. XXX said, "We can't do accounting, we can't record without account books (a clumsy way of recording)." The next day, before they could even put down their bowls after eating, each street launched a struggle against the landlords. The six troublemaking landlords stood before the masses, awaiting their judgment. The masses finally decided on the following measures: (1) Expel the landlords from the mutual aid society and resolutely separate from the landlords' families. (2) Elect five farmers, including Cheng Yufang, to form a public security committee, and each street will establish a public security team to specifically manage the landlords and monitor their activities. (3) If a landlord wants to go to another village, they must bring a letter of introduction from this town, and upon arrival in the other village, they must first find the village office and then write a reply, so that the masses in other villages can also pay attention to their actions. When the meeting adjourned, everyone discussed in small groups: "We should have done this a long time ago!" (Qin Yumei, Shi Jintang, Shen Yongxiang)

    任村整顿互助社
    赶出六个地主
    【本报林县讯】林县任村群众在节约备荒当中，发现了不少地主钻到群众互助社里，大吃大喝养的膘肥肉胖不给群众设法生产，他们说：“赚了钱还可以，赔了钱，人家又要打咱的。”他们想尽了千方百计，抓住各个空隙，造谣破坏。政府号召防旱，地主×××对群众说：“咱没啦地了吧，也该给你们下点雨呀，老天又偏偏不给下。”大家讨论节约不走亲戚，一街地主岳五伦，偏叫他亲戚起早来做周年，结果群众又从他家搜出粮食两石多。运输时四街地主苏广灵赶着农民牲口，故意打折腿。更狠毒的如地主苏克让放火点群众房子，张文质掀农民门楼，苏老景锯农会的树，当会计做假帐，挑拨互助组不团结等各种破坏活动。二十三号晚群众经过酝酿讨论，一致说：“咱翻身哩，咱谁有人家地主吃的好，拿上老百姓的钱，坐在互助社，当大经理大会计哩！还是威风神气，光吃不动”。最后大家讨论到底离了地主互助社里行不行？××说：“咱不会记帐，咱不会记不摊帐（笨记法）”。第二天不等放下饭碗，各街向地主展开了斗争，捣蛋的六个地主，立正在群众的面前，静候大家的发落，群众最后决定以下几种办法：（一）开除地主出互助社，坚决和地主分清家。（二）选举农民程玉芳等五人成立治安委员会，各街再成立治安小组，专门负责管理地主监视他的活动。（三）地主如果要到外村去，就带上本镇介绍信，到了别村先找村公所，再写回信来，以便别村群众也注意他的行动。散会的时候大家三三两两议论着：“早就该这样哩！”（秦玉美、石金堂、申永祥）
