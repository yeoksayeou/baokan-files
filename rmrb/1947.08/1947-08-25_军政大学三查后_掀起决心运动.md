　　After the Military and Political University's Three Examinations
  　Launching a Determination Movement
    [Reported by this newspaper] Following the Three Examinations study at the Military and Political University, a determination movement was launched immediately. All personnel voluntarily announced to the Party that after the Three Examinations, they would definitely transform themselves, resolve to resolutely implement the three major tasks, and perform meritorious service for the people in the great counter-offensive. The Fourth Detachment, composed of newly promoted squad and platoon-level cadres transferred from the front-line columns and new recruits, sent a letter to the Central Bureau, excerpted as follows... Recalling the past, our parents, brothers, and sisters were trampled under the feet of the landlord class and suffered greatly. Now there are still 300 million people suffering the same hardships as we did in the past. We all vow to make the following determinations: (1) Work actively, study hard, practice diligently, unite and help each other, quickly learn our skills, go to the front lines, and strive for the early victory of the overall counter-offensive. (2) To completely defeat Chiang Kai-shek and drive away American imperialism, resolutely obey orders, and never waver or fear under any difficult circumstances. (3) Help the masses to thoroughly emancipate themselves, eliminate the landlord class, vigorously practice production and thrift, and support the government and cherish the people. (Méi Cūn)
