　　Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 17th: Moscow Dispatch: Soviet railway construction is advancing rapidly. The new Five-Year Plan stipulates an investment of 40.1 billion rubles in railway construction, accounting for one-sixth of the total investment of the Five-Year Plan. In the year and a half since the plan began, of the 65,000 kilometers of railway lines, 500,000 kilometers of railway signal communications, 13,000 bridges totaling 300 kilometers in length, 4,000 stations, 15,800 locomotives, and 428,000 special carriages that were severely damaged by the German bandits during the war, most have been repaired or are being reconstructed. The total length of railway lines is now more than 114,000 kilometers, and the volume of transportation is also rapidly recovering, increasing by 11.4 percent in July this year compared to the same period last year. Passengers have reached pre-war numbers, and an additional 44 million passengers will be transported this year. More than 1,000 kilometers of new railways have been built, and the added double-track railways are even longer than this. This year, plans are being made to build 1,226 kilometers of lines and 1,265 kilometers of double tracks. Soviet railway construction has also seen tremendous improvements in quality. The railway bridges rebuilt over the Don River and many other large rivers are more solid than before. 1,000 kilometers of railway have been electrified, and the total length of electrified railways to be completed during the entire Five-Year Plan will reach more than 5,300 kilometers. In the past year and a half, railway employees have created 50,000 new inventions. Engineer Rognovsky was awarded the Stalin Prize for inventing a machine that accelerates locomotive water intake. At present, the Soviet Ministry of Railways is sparing no effort to improve the lives of workers to ensure better work for railway employees. In the past year and a half, 1.5 million square meters of worker housing have been built, and the four small bungalows under construction all have beautiful bedrooms, living rooms, kitchens, and gardens. By the time the Five-Year Plan is completed, railway workers will receive 5.5 million square meters of new housing.

    【新华社陕北十七日电】莫斯科讯：苏联铁路建设突飞猛进。在新五年计划中，规定对铁路建设的投资是四百零一亿卢布，占五年计划总投资六分之一。自该计划开始以来的一年半中，在战争期间惨遭德寇破坏的六万五千公里的铁路线，五十万公里的铁路信号联络，长达三百公里的一万三千座桥梁，四千个车站，一万五千八百个火车头，四十二万八千辆专厢，已大部修复或在重修中。现铁路线全长十一万四千多公里，运输量也急速恢复，今年七月份比去年同期增加百分之十一点四。乘客已达战前数量，本年内还要增运四千四百万人。新修铁路已达一千余公里，增设的双轨铁道比此更长。今年尚准备修建路线一千二百二十六公里、双轨一千二百六十五公里。苏联的铁道建设，在质量上也获有巨大改进，伯河顿河与许多大河上重建起来的铁桥，比以前更为坚固。一千公里的铁路已电化，而在整个五年计划中完成电气化的铁路将达五千三百多公里。铁路员工一年半以来，已创造了五万件新发明，工程师罗格诺维基因为发明加速机车吸水的机器而获得斯大林奖金。目前苏联铁道部为保证铁路员工更好的工作，不遗余力地改善工人生活。一年半来修建工人住宅面积达一百五十万平方公尺，正在建筑中的四个所小洋房，都有优美的卧室、客厅、厨房与花园。到五年计划完成时，铁路工人们将得到面积达五百五十万平方公尺的新住房。
