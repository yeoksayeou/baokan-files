[Reported by this newspaper from Lucheng] Comrade Han Manying, a model cadre from Changzhuang Village in the Fourth District, convened a meeting of more than 300 cadres and villagers on the 12th of this month, telling everyone, "This year, our village's crops have suffered a 30% reduction in yield. In order to support the front lines and increase food production, we should expand the wheat fields. Autumn has already begun, and there's only a month left before wheat sowing, so we should accumulate a large amount of fertilizer now." Old farmer Han Qiuxi said, "To prevent three years of famine in ten years, we must harvest two years' worth of grain in one year. Plant beans and hemp in the spring, and sow wheat early in the autumn. After the summer harvest, plant buckwheat and beans as a second crop, grabbing grain twice a year. If we all cooperate well, we'll have a surplus of grain for security." Then, everyone suggested planting more wheat. The village has 760 mu of bean fields, 410 mu of hemp fields, 600 mu of densely planted corn fields, 350 mu of sparsely planted corn fields, and 200 mu of sweet potato and gourd fields, totaling 2,320 mu, all of which should be converted to wheat. There are also more than 800 mu of regular wheat fields, so this year we can plant a total of 3,120 mu of wheat, exceeding last year by one and a half times. The total land area of the village is 5,846.5 mu, with wheat planting accounting for 53.4% of the total land area. When discussing the fertilizer issue, people suggested going to distant places to collect thorn bushes where sheep lie down, cutting artemisia and scraping turf, and smoking wasteland and caves for fertilizer. Han Manying's innovative method is: "Put manure in the latrine, let it decompose for a month, then apply it to the wheat fields. The wheat will grow vigorously, and the flour milled from it will be high-quality white flour." Han Youde's innovative method is: "Using virgin soil is very effective for planting wheat. Turn the soil over and use it as a base. Cut old artemisia and chop it with a knife, then spread it all over the ground. Plow it under the soil, and you're guaranteed a good harvest next summer." Lian Keren said, "My fertilizer is no problem this year. Wheat bran and wheat straw must be decomposed into manure. Some flower seeds should also be ground up, and there are many sheep manure, sesame cakes, and bean cakes to be applied with the seeder." Han Manying added, "Stir wheat seeds with oil and mix them well, then dry them once. The oil will be absorbed into the wheat seeds, ensuring nine seedlings per seed." When discussing how to sow wheat, Tian Sihei said, "I'll sow 14 qing of wheat with a plow, applying 30 dan of fertilizer per mu, and I'll sow more than 7 qing of wheat with a two-legged seeder, applying 5.5 pieces of bean cake per mu." Chang Tu said, "Spreading fertilizer all over the ground is not as good as applying fertilizer in a line. A two-legged seeder is very effective, sowing seeds and fertilizer at the same time. The fertilizer is applied at the roots of the wheat, so it grows tall with large ears." Han Xinghai said, "I'll plant more than 9 qing of wheat with night soil, applying 20 dan of fertilizer per mu. Applying night soil to every mound is better than applying fertilizer in a line." After such discussions, the masses were in high spirits. Men and women, young and old, all worked harder, cutting Bothriochloa ischaemum and artemisia, competing to see who could do better, a truly lively and bustling scene. (Joint Office)

[Reported by this newspaper from Yushe] Jia Yu Village in the First District recently accurately calculated the village's assets, clarified the people's thinking, and re-recognized the severity of the disaster. They unanimously agreed that they must do everything possible to produce and save, strive not to go hungry, and defeat Chiang Kai-shek as soon as possible. After deliberation and discussion, they decided to seize the opportunity to increase production to make up for the shortfall. After reorganizing the various production organizations, all the men, women, old and young in the village poured into the movement. From August 3rd to the present, in terms of agriculture: 147,564 jin of artemisia have been cut, filling 35 manure pits; 456 zhang of wheat field edges have been excavated, and 37 zhang of embankments have been built. In addition to replanting vegetables on the blank land along the edges, 24 mutual aid groups have rushed to reclaim 50 mu of wasteland and planted vegetables all at once. In terms of sideline occupations: 48 laborers and 25 donkeys have been used solely for transportation, earning 754,634 yuan. Laborers earning by carrying loads have made 321,514 yuan, and children digging up 1,600 jin of medicinal herbs have earned 28,400 yuan. The total earnings are more than 1.1 million yuan, which can buy 79 shi of rice. 302 women began the second hundred-day spinning campaign on the 5th, and 49 female children also joined the spinning group. 36 accelerated spinning wheels have been renovated, spinning half a jin of cotton per day. In addition to spinning, the women also collect 10 jin of wild vegetables per person every afternoon, and have already collected 3,547 jin. To simplify and equalize the labor of agricultural and sideline occupations and male and female workers, the cooperative printed labor tickets and was personally responsible for calculations. When necessary, the masses can take the labor tickets to the cooperative to exchange for goods. Now there is not a single idler in the village, and even the children are busy with production.

    【本报潞城讯】四区常庄村模范干部韩满英同志，于本月十二日召开全村干部群众三百余人大会，向大家说：“今年田禾咱村歉收三成，为了支援前线，增加粮食，应扩大麦田。现在立了秋，离种麦时间只有一个月，现在应大量积肥”。老农民韩秋喜说：“想防十年三个荒，一年要收二年粮，春种豆子和大麻，秋天麦子早种上，夏后回茬荞麦豆，一年两头来抢粮，咱们大家互助好，耕三余一有保障”。接着大家纷纷提出要多种麦，全村豆地七百六十亩，大麻地四百一十亩，对安玉茭地六百亩，稀玉茭地三百五十亩，地瓜葫麻地二百亩，共地二千三百二十亩，都要改麦，还有正茬麦地八百余亩，今年共能种麦三千一百二十亩，超过去年一倍半。全村土地五千八百四十六亩半，种麦占全村总土地数百分之五十三点四。讨论到肥料问题时，远地卧羊割圪针，割蒿刮草皮，薰荒薰洞上到地。韩满英创造的办法是：圈粪放在茅坑里，沤上一月上麦地，麦子长的闹喧天，磨出来还是好白面。韩有德创造办法是：种麦生土作用大，土倒土来垫一下，割上老蒿用刀铡，铡碎以后满地撒，一犁翻在地底下，管保明年收好夏。连科仁说：“我今年肥料不成问题，麦糠麦秸要烂成粪，有些花籽也碾了它，还有许多羊圈粪麻饼豆饼随耧下。”韩满英又说：“麦籽搅油拌一拌，拌一次来晒一遍，将油吃在麦籽里，一麦九苗管保险”。讨论如何种麦时，田四亥说：“随犁溜麦十四顷，每亩地上粪卅担，两条腿耧种麦七顷多，每亩豆饼五块半”。长秃说：“满地肥料撒个遍，不如上粪一条线，两条腿耧作用大，种籽肥料一齐下，肥料下在麦子根，长的高来穗又大”。韩兴亥说：“圊粪栽麦九顷多，每亩上粪二十担，每安都把圊粪上，胜似上粪一条线”。经过这样讨论后，群众情绪都很高，男女老少都加劲，又割马连又割蒿，你强我胜来争功，轰轰烈烈真热闹。（联合办公室）
