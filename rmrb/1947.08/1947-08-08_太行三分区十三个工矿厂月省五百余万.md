Taihang Third Sub-district

Thirteen Factories and Mines

Save Over Five Million Monthly

[Report from this newspaper in Taihang] The factories and mines in the Third Sub-district have successively held meetings to discuss drought resistance and overcoming the famine. Many muddled ideas were discovered. For example, workers at the Lucheng County United Cooperative said: "Whether we make money or not, at least our bellies will be full," and "We survived the famine in 1943, we didn't starve to death." Workers at the Xinhua Paper Mill said: "The Liberated Area is so big, and we have money, are we afraid of not being able to buy grain?" There was a sense of complacency about the famine. After discussions, the understanding gradually became clear. Led by party members and cadres, each factory formulated conservation plans and reduced living standards. The Liberation Printing Factory changed from eating wheat once a day to twice every seven days. The Paper Mill saved two liang of millet and 50 yuan in food expenses per person per day, and changed from eating wheat every two days to once every seven days. The Jiazhang Mine saved four liang of white flour per person per day. According to statistics from ten mines and factories, simply reducing living standards can save over 1,570,000 yuan per month. Looking at saving raw materials, for example, the core baking room of the sand turning department of the bomb factory used to use charcoal but now uses firewood, saving 3,900 jin of charcoal per month, and the core box saves three and a half liang of charcoal per month. Hero Wang Qingxian used white wax instead of yellow wax, and ironworker Wang Qishou burned coal instead of charcoal. The four mines saved over 519,000 yuan in raw materials per month. Employees voluntarily reduced their wages and donated money and labor. Li Laixiu of the Xinhua Paper Mill voluntarily reduced his monthly wage by five dou of millet. Under his influence, everyone reduced their wages, saving seven shi of millet for the whole month. The workers at the Jiazhang Mine reduced their flour intake by half a jin and their rice intake by half a sheng per day. All bonus millet and surplus production goods were voluntarily relinquished.
    Some workers at the Huafeng Factory donated one-third of all their income. Sixty-eight people donated over three hundred workdays. Other factories also contributed voluntary labor and meritorious labor. According to statistics from five mines and factories, the total value of donated labor and money per month was over 1,200,000 yuan. According to incomplete statistics, the total savings from reducing living standards, saving raw materials, reducing wages, and donating labor and money in the thirteen factories amounted to 5,539,000 yuan per month.

    太行三分区
    十三个工矿厂
    月省五百余万
    【本报太行讯】三分区各工厂、先后召开了抗旱渡荒座谈会，发现了好多涂糊想法，如潞城县联社工友说：“赚钱不赚钱落个肚儿圆”，“四三年也经过灾荒，咱们还没有饿死”，新华造纸厂工友说：“解放区地方大、咱们有钱还怕籴不到粮食吗？”对灾荒存在着麻痹思想，经过座谈讨论，认识逐渐明确，各厂由党员干部带头，纷纷制节约计划，降低生活水平。解放印刷厂一天一顿面改为七天二顿面，造纸厂每天每人节约小米二两菜金五十元，二天一面改为七天一顿面，贾掌矿每天每人节约白面四两。据十个矿厂统计，每月只降低生活一项，可节约洋一百五十七万余元，再从节省原料上看。如炸弹所翻沙部烤芯房，过去用炭现用柴，每月省炭三千九百斤，芯盒每月省炭三两半。英雄王庆贤用白腊代替黄腊，铁工王其寿不烧炭烧煤，四个矿厂月省原料洋五十一万九千余元。职工纷纷自动降低工资，献金献工，新华纸厂李来秀自动每月降低工资米五斗，在他的影响下大家纷纷降资，全月可节省小米七石，贾掌矿下井工友每天减少面半斤半升米，奖金米及生产余货累进小米全部不要。
    华丰工厂有的献金全部所得三分之一，六十八人献工三百多个，其他加义务工献立功工等各厂都有，据五个矿厂统计，每月献工献金合洋一百二十万余元，十三个工厂每月降低生活水平、节省原料、降低工资、献工献金等四项节约数，据不完全统计，即达五百五十三万九千余元。（王道兴）
