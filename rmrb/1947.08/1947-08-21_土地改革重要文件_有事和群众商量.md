Important Documents on Land Reform
　　Discuss Matters with the Masses
    The four articles compiled in this book are all important documents from the land reform movement. These four documents all emphasize that to thoroughly complete land reform, it is necessary to resolutely implement the class line and the mass line. Therefore, all comrades participating in mass movement work and studying the land reform movement should have a copy in hand, study it day and night, to clarify their class stance and mass viewpoint, so as to further understand the issues raised in this document: how to unite the middle peasants, how to distribute the fruits [of land reform], and how to adjust the relationship between cadres and the masses.
    Comrades participating in mass movement work and studying the land reform movement should especially have a copy in hand.
