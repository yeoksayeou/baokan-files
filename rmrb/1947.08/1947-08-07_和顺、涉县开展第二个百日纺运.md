    Launch Second Hundred-Day Spinning Campaign
    [Our Newspaper] Heshun First District recently convened a conference of over a hundred people, including heads of district-wide textile model cooperatives and chairwomen of women's salvation associations, to summarize the spring's hundred-day spinning campaign. Historically, the district had no spinning tradition, and organization only began after the land reform was implemented last year. The spring hundred-day spinning campaign saw rapid development, with the district reaching 2,163 spinning wheels, 210 looms, 2,195 female spinners, and 361 female weavers. A total of 7,374 catties of cotton were spun, and 3,138 zhang of cloth were woven, generating a profit of 919,530 yuan. In particular, the spinning achievements of Ren Yuanhan Village are nearing self-sufficiency in clothing. Three model villages and nine spinning models were selected and awarded. After summarizing the hundred-day spinning campaign, it was proposed: "To achieve 'thirteen plus one,' we must achieve self-sufficiency in clothing." "To achieve self-sufficiency in clothing, spinning must be carried out throughout the year." After deliberation and precise calculation, it was unanimously recognized that although the hundred-day spinning had achieved great results, it was still far from self-sufficiency in clothing. Therefore, the launch of a second hundred-day spinning campaign was proposed. Each village then formulated future plans. Combining the plans of various villages, the district aims to spin 16,000 catties of cotton and weave 12,000 zhang of cloth in the second hundred-day spinning campaign; increase looms by 200 and female weavers by 300. Finally, everyone proposed: "What we say, we must do. Go back and start immediately, and never rest." (Heshun Cooperative Report)
    [Our Newspaper, Shexian News] The Eighth District convened a meeting of 72 people on July 31st, including cooperative managers, women's association chairwomen, textile model heroes and experts from the entire district, to discuss the development of the second hundred-day textile movement. It was discovered that some cadres and women had some ideological obstacles. For example, the manager of the Fushan Kiln Cooperative said: "We don't care about others; the women know how to spin anyway." Women feared spinning cotton for the public again like last year. They thought that summer was hot, there were many other tasks, and they would be too busy. Also, they were afraid that no one would want to buy the cloth if they made it. These thoughts were discussed and resolved. Wang Ernu, a textile hero from Siziyan, introduced her experience in leading small factories for equal value exchange and transforming lazy women. Tao Yin, an old textile expert from Dongjiagou, introduced the experience of sizing yarn, saying: "Before sizing the yarn, first boil it thoroughly in boiling water, then cool it with cold water, pound it a little, stretch it lengthwise, dry it in the sun, and prepare the yarn well. This makes it easy to size, and the flour is absorbed into the yarn. Even coarse yarn can be made uniform. Weigh twenty taels of yarn as one catty, use three liang of flour for a new scale in the spring when the wind is strange, three and a half liang of flour in the summer and autumn when the weather is humid, and four liang in the winter. The cloth that is woven is flat and does not break easily." Dong Anju also introduced how the warping machine saves labor. Everyone said: We must improve our tools and improve our technology in the future. When each village made plans, Wang Ernu from Siziyan first guaranteed that during the hundred-day textile production, every woman in the village would guarantee to produce five catties of cloth, except for all the miscellaneous work in the autumn. Her team guaranteed to sell seven and a half catties of cloth per person. Fu Lan'e from Hengling wanted to challenge Wang Ernu. Under their influence, every woman in each village in the district guaranteed to sell five catties of cloth. Twenty-two villages attended the meeting, with a total of 5,110 women, who should sell a total of more than 15,000 catties of cloth. Each catty of cloth can earn a net profit of one thousand yuan, for a total profit of fifteen million five hundred and fifty thousand yuan. At four thousand yuan per large dou of rice, a total of three hundred and eighty-eight shi of rice (large stone) can be bought. This plan can be completed by the fifteenth day of the eighth lunar month. The chairwoman of the Qingta Women's Association said that she would not have learned so much if she had not come to the meeting. Fu Lan'e from Hengling said: We must weave the cloth well and also guarantee that our troops will have cotton clothes to wear earlier in the winter. (Yi Lin, Xiang He)
