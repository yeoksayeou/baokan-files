Xinhua News Agency, Central China, July 7th: The summer mass guerrilla movement in the four counties of Jianghou (Nantong), Rugao, Haimen, and Qidong in Central Jiangsu, behind enemy lines, has created three innovations: First, the entire county mobilizes to weave a guerrilla fire network. More than 400 large and small armed units are dispatched simultaneously, with the armed forces of each district, township, and village coordinating or operating in joint defense. They sometimes combine into powerful corps to launch surprise attacks and annihilate the enemy. For example, the Lingdian battle annihilated more than 500 enemy soldiers. At other times, they disperse to conduct guerrilla warfare, launching several battles a day, spreading throughout the border areas, and penetrating deep into the Jiang-occupied areas. In the past three months, they have annihilated more than 2,000 enemy soldiers and captured 18 strongholds. Second, they have created various new tactics. The "Divine Eagle Battle" employs elite armed forces with the "three fierce" spirit of "fierce attack, fierce charge, and fierce advance" to thrust towards the border areas. Waiting for the enemy to arrive, they suddenly descend like divine eagles from the sky, cutting off their retreat and annihilating them in a short period of time. The Haidong District Team used this tactic to defeat an enemy five times its size, and the Qidong District Team defeated an enemy ten times its size when counterattacking the enemy's three-pronged attack. "Vital Point Battle": specifically targeting and attacking the petty villains hated by the masses. "Grab-from-the-Bag Battle": penetrating deep into enemy strongholds to capture the enemy. Other tactics include "Blossom Battle" and "Nerve Battle," which have been very effective. Third, various struggles are combined. The Qidong guerrilla movement is combined with the mass blacklisting movement, and within two months, more than 500 enemy soldiers have been won over to our side. A unit of the Nantong local armed forces penetrated deep into the Jiang-occupied areas on the east side of the Tong-Ru line to launch political offensives. The local people everywhere spread rumors that "the New Fourth Army has come with two regiments," scaring the Jiang strongholds of Baipu and Shigang in Nantong into emergency alert, constantly inquiring about the situation and seeking reinforcements on the phone, with enemy soldiers and officers taking their families into the city, creating chaos, and more than 20 people defecting to our side.

Xinhua News Agency, Central China, July 7th: The military and civilians in the Jiang-occupied areas of Central Jiangsu are launching a slogan propaganda war against the enemy. Propaganda teams in various places often write huge slogans in Jiang-occupied areas or border areas. The content includes current affairs education, self-defense methods, and the atrocities of the Jiang army, appearing in the form of ditties, wall poems, and paintings, becoming a powerful weapon for disintegrating the enemy and educating the people. Propaganda teams often use wooden victory signs in areas frequently "swept" by the Jiang army, placing them on waterwheels and along the edges of fields to publicize the achievements of the People's Liberation Army and the victories of the anti-"sweeping" campaign, which the Jiang authorities find extremely threatening. Once, the Gaoyou County propaganda team wrote anti-Jiang slogans in Xiejiazhuang, and the enemy dared not enter the village for three days. On the fourth day, Chen Zhaoxun, the head of the "Homecoming Corps," saw the slogan "Capture Chen Zhaoxun alive" as soon as he entered the village and ran away. Whenever a propaganda team comes to the village, the masses prepare cigarettes or dyes in advance for the propaganda team to use. Every little tune written is spread everywhere by the masses, and the masses also help the propaganda team create slogans. Once, the propaganda team wrote "No Jiang donations, no Jiang taxes," and the masses revised it to "Where donations are given, bad luck will follow, if you don't oppose Jiang's taxes, there will be no end to paying," which is vivid and powerful. Another example is the slogan collectively created by the masses on the current situation: "The Homecoming Corps can't rely on old Jiang, old Jiang is defeated and there is no hope, only turning back and self-reforming will save your life," which is also popular and touching.

    苏中群众对敌斗争新创造
    全面出动组成游击火网
    【新华社华中七日电】苏中蒋后南（通）如（皋）海（门）启（东）四县夏季群众游击运动三创造：一、全县出动织成游击火网。四百多支大小武装一齐出动，各区、乡、村武装协同策应或联防作战。时或结为强大兵团突击歼敌，如灵甸战斗即歼敌五百余名。或则分散游击处处打响，一日数战，普及各边沿区，深入蒋占区，三月来已歼敌二千余名，克据点十八处。二、创造多种新战术。“神鹰战”以精干武装用“猛打猛冲猛进”的三猛精神挺向边沿，待敌至前，骤如神鹰天降，切断其后路，于短促时间内歼灭敌人。海东区队运用此战术击溃五倍之敌，启东区队反击敌三路合击时战胜十倍之敌“要害战”；指名指姓专打群众痛恨的小坏蛋。“探囊战”深入敌据点取敌。其他尚有“开花战”“神经战”等，收效甚大。三、各种斗争相结合。启东游击运动与群众性擦黑点运动结合，两月内即争取五百余士蒋来归。南通地方武装一部深入通如线东侧蒋占区展开政攻，当地群众即到处哄传“新四军来了两个团”吓得南通白蒲、石港等据点紧急戒严，终日在电话上互询情况求救兵，士蒋纷纷携眷进城，形成一片混乱，并有二十余人向我自新。
    【新华社华中七日电】苏中蒋后军民对敌展开标语宣传战，各地宣传队常在蒋占区或边沿区书写巨大标语，内容包括时事教育，自卫办法、蒋军暴行等，以小调墙头诗画等形式出现，成为瓦解蒋伪教育人民的有力武器。宣传队常在蒋军经常“扫荡”地区，用木板制成胜利牌，插在水车上，田塍边宣扬解放军战绩与反“扫荡”捷报，蒋伪感到极大威胁。一次，高邮县宣传队在卸甲庄写上反蒋伪标语，敌人三天不敢上庄，第四天“还乡团”头子陈兆旬一上庄，迎面看见“活捉陈兆旬”标语，拔腿就跑。每逢宣传队上庄，群众即事先准备好的烟或染料，供宣传队使用。每一小调写出，群众即四处传播，群众并帮助宣传队创造标语。一次宣传队写出“不出蒋捐，不缴蒋费”，群众即修改为“那处出捐那处就倒霉，不反蒋捐税，缴纳没有底”，生动有力。又如群众集体创作时局标语有“还乡团休想靠老蒋，老蒋败了没指望，只有回头自新性命长。”亦通俗感人。
