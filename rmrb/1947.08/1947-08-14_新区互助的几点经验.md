Several Experiences in Mutual Aid in the New District

The mutual aid organizations in the Taihang New District have achieved great results in the past six months. According to materials from Gaoyi, Heshun, and Changzhi alone, more than 6,900 mutual aid groups have been restored and organized, with more than 60,000 households participating, accounting for more than 90% of the total number of households, and 110,000 men and women participating with full and semi-labor power, accounting for 85% of the total labor force. Now, the following points of experience in mutual aid in the new district in the past six months are comprehensively studied:

(1) Conscious organization is the key to getting organized.

The masses in the new district have some confused ideas about mutual aid organizations: First, the emancipated poor peasants and hired laborers believe that "participating in mutual aid is to repay Chairman Mao's kindness"; second, they believe that "mutual aid is the partnership of labor and animal power to level the field"; third, they narrowly believe, based on last year's experience, that "mutual aid is a temporary rush during the busy farming season." In addition, some old middle peasants have ideological concerns such as fear of suffering losses and being restricted by participating in mutual aid. These confused ideas have become the main obstacle to further comprehensive organization and the consolidation and improvement of mutual aid. In order to break through this ideological obstacle, all localities first focus on promoting the positive aspects, carry out mutual assistance and mutual benefit education of getting organized from the summary of past mutual aid achievements, and further improve the organization consciousness. The masses in Beiquan, Changzhi, summarized the benefits of mutual aid as: "Without mutual aid, we would not be able to plant the land this year, save 2,000 workdays, and earn 6.8 million in sideline money." This broke the confused ideas of fearing losses from mutual aid, simply repaying gratitude, and temporary mutual aid. Mutual aid immediately increased from more than 130 households to more than 200 households. The experience of Sudian, Changzhi, is that, combined with summarizing the benefits of mutual aid, at the same time, clear up the remaining problems and establish a new system of equivalent exchange, thoroughly breaking the idea that mutual aid is to level labor and animal power, and the masses voluntarily organized 38 groups. After continuously summarizing the benefits of mutual aid in the new district of Huguan, many temporary agricultural mutual aid groups have rapidly developed into long-term mutual aid combining agriculture and sideline industries.

(2) The key to organizing and consolidating mutual aid.

First, "Mutual aid must be voluntary combination"; but why is there still a lot of forced mutual aid? The main reasons are the cadres' simple view of completing tasks, pursuing numbers and scale, and the idea of "leveling labor and animal power" by emphasizing taking care of households with no animal power, weak labor power, and no labor and animal power. In the spring of this year, all localities carried out rectification, first adopting the comparison between the lessons of past failed group formation and the successful facts of voluntary mutual aid, opening up the above-mentioned ideas of the cadres, thoroughly and boldly letting go, and letting the masses freely find people with similar tastes to combine mutual aid. For households with no labor force, they are mobilized to take the initiative to find mutual aid groups and stipulate their own exchange of labor methods; at the same time, each group is also called upon to lead households with no labor force by means of equivalent exchange; Beiliang in Neiqiu, Nantianhe in Changzhi, and Nanhedi in Wu'an adopted this method, and more than 40 lonely and widowed households rejoined the mutual aid groups. Another experience in implementing voluntary combination and rectifying mutual aid groups is that the leadership approved the temporary squeezing out of a small number of sharp, lazy households, which actually educated these people; 24 sharp, lazy households squeezed out in Nantianhe, Changzhi, and Nanhedi, Wu'an, later rejoined the mutual aid groups after making public self-criticism and proposing guarantees.

Second, the key to consolidating mutual aid is to conscientiously implement equivalent exchange. The main problems encountered in the rectification of mutual aid in various localities are also the remaining unequal exchange and no exchange at equivalent prices. The reason is that in the past, one-sided emphasis was placed on "peasants all over the world are one family, taking care of the red poor, and being completely selfless," which made peasants afraid to say "backward," and they were unwilling and dared not say it. The solution is to first resolutely clear up the remaining problems of owed labor, and educate the masses to open up their minds with facts; Xiquhe, Taigu, specifically did this: all cadres first repaid the owed wages and rice, which promoted the thorough settlement of accounts between groups and households in the whole village. Secondly, establishing a new equivalent exchange from the positive aspect further encouraged and consolidated the mutual aid sentiment of the masses; there are two points of creation in specific practices: (1) First, open up the confused ideas of the poor and hired laborers who "fear equivalent prices and paying wages"; Si Jia Zhuang in Gaoyi first convened a meeting of poor and hired labor activists, and used specific accounting "active work, not afraid of owing work" and "unequal price, mutual aid collapse, the poor and hired suffer more" to open up their minds, and more than half of the mutual aid groups in the village smoothly implemented the new equivalent exchange. (2) Through summarizing mutual aid, widely spread the experience of equivalent exchange. Sudian, Changzhi, mainly spread the main experience of equivalent exchange: First, the standard of evaluation is based on the ease and difficulty of life, the amount and quality of work, and the evaluation of work is based on the standard of evaluation, and then the increase and deduction of points is strictly implemented; second, on-site evaluation of work, regular and frequent settlement of accounts, and timely repayment of work or wages.

(3) Establish a mutual aid leadership with the poor and hired laborers as the backbone.

Taking the emancipated poor and hired laborers (i.e., new middle peasants) as the backbone, uniting the middle peasants, and organizing mutual aid is a new development in the Taihang mutual aid movement this year, and it is the class line in organizing mutual aid. The conditions for its development are that after land reform, the poor and hired laborers have obtained more affluent production conditions, and their production thinking and organizational consciousness have been unprecedentedly improved, and their demands for becoming rich are the most urgent; while the middle peasants have a poorer awareness, and even still have ideological concerns such as fear of being struggled against, and it is impossible to actively lead all the peasants to organize mutual aid production and become rich. The basic experience of various localities is to first train a large number of poor and hired laborers to cultivate backbones. For example, the Gaoyi sub-district convened a meeting of nearly 2,000 poor and hired peasants, with an average of about 20 people per village, to conduct short-term education; after 10 poor and hired labor activists in Licun returned to the village, they united 40 poor and hired laborers and some middle peasant activists to conduct a large-scale connection throughout the village, which encouraged the mutual aid sentiment of the middle peasants and quickly combined 18 mutual aid groups.

　　新区互助的几点经验
    ·蕴·
    太行新区互助组织，半年来成绩很大，仅据高邑、和顺、长治的材料，恢复与组织起六千九百余个互助组，参加户数六万余，占总户数百分之九十强，参加男女全半劳力十一万个，占劳力总数百分之八十五。现将半年来新区互助的几点经验综合研究如下：
    （一）组织自觉是组织起来的锁钥。
    新区群众对于互助组织，存在着一些糊涂观念：一、翻身贫雇认为“参加互助，报毛主席的恩”；二、认为“互助是劳畜力的合伙填平”；三、狭隘的根据去年经验，认为“互助是农忙临时突击一下”。另外，部分旧中农存在着参加互助怕吃亏，怕受限制等思想顾虑。这些糊涂思想成为进一步全面组织起来与巩固提高互助的主要障碍。各地突破这一思想障碍，首先抓紧发扬积极面，从总结过去互助成绩中，进行组织起来的互助互利教育，进一步提高组织自觉。长治北泉群众总结互助好处是：“不是互助，今年就种不上地，省不下两千工，赚不了六百八十万副业钱”，以此打破怕互助吃亏，单纯报恩，临时互助等糊涂思想，互助马上由一百三十余户增至二百余户。长治苏店的经验是，结合总结互助好处，同时清理遗留问题，确立新的等价交换制度，彻底打破互助是劳畜力填平思想，群众才自愿组织起三十八个小组。壶关新区经过不断总结互助好处，不少农业临时互助组，迅速发展为农副结合的长期互助。
    （二）组织与巩固互助的关键。
    第一、“互助必须是自愿结合”；但为什么有不少互助仍是强编的呢？主要原因是干部单纯完成任务观点，追求数字与规模，以及强调照顾无畜力，弱劳力，无劳畜力户的“劳畜力填平”思想在作怪。各地今春进行整顿，首先采用检讨过去编组失败教训与自愿互助成功事实对比，打通了干部上述思想，彻底大胆放手，让群众重新自由找合口味人结合互助。对无劳力户，则动员他们主动去找互助组，并订出自己换工办法；同时亦号召各组以等价交换来带领无劳力户；内邱北良，长治南天河，武安南河底采用此办法，四十余户孤寡又重新参加了互助组。贯彻自愿结合整顿互助组的另一经验是，领导上批准群众暂时挤出少数尖头懒汉户，实际教育了这种人；长治南天河，武安南底被挤出的二十四户尖头懒汉户，以后经过当众检讨，提出保证条件，才又重新参加了互助组。
    第二、巩固互助的关键，是认真执行等价交换。各地整顿互助中，所碰到的主要问题，亦是遗留的交换不等价，等价不交换。其原因是由于过去片面的强调“天下农民是一家，照顾赤贫，大公无私”，而造成农民怕说“落后”，心里不满意也不敢说。解决的办法，首先坚决清理遗留的欠工问题，以事实教育群众打通思想；太谷西曲河具体作法是：全体干部首先清还了所欠工资米，推动了全村组与组、户与户彻底清帐。其次，从积极方面确立新的等价交换，更鼓舞与巩固群众的互助情绪；具体作法上有两点创造：（一）首先打通贫雇“怕等价，出工资”的糊涂思想；高邑寺家庄先召开了贫雇积极分子会，用具体算帐“积极干，就不怕欠工”与“不等价，互助垮台，贫雇更受害”，打通其思想，全村半数以上互助组顺利实行了新的等价交换。（二）通过总结互助，广泛传播等价交换经验。长治苏店传播等价交换主要经验：一是按生活好做难做，做的多少好坏为评工标准，评工中发扬争工，然后以评工标准按活严格执行增分，扣分；二是就地评工，定期勤结帐，及时还工或还工资。
    （三）树立以贫雇为骨干的互助领导。
    以翻身贫雇（即新中农）为骨干，团结中农，组织互助，是今年太行互助运动的一个新发展，是组织互助上的阶级路线。其发展条件是经过土地改革，贫雇获得较富裕的生产条件，生产思想与组织自觉空前提高，发家要求最迫切；而中农觉悟较差，甚至还存在着怕斗等思想顾虑，不可能积极带领全体农民组织互助生产闹发家。各地基本经验是首先大批训练贫雇，培养骨干。如高邑分区召开了近两千人的贫雇农会议，一村平均二十人左右，进行短期教育；里村十个贫雇积极分子回村后，又团结了四十个贫雇与部分中农积极分子，进行全村大串通，鼓舞了中农互助情绪，很快结合起十八个互助组。
