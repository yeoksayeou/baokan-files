Xinhua News Agency, Jinji-Luyu, 12th: Since Chiang Kai-shek's troops invaded Juancheng Linpuji on July 30th and Juancheng on August 6th, they have been frantically destroying embankment works along the river in recent days. On July 29th, 25 cables of the third dam of the Jiangsu Dam were cut for the second time by Chiang Kai-shek's agents, and the situation was critical. The masses of Yuncheng, Linpu (newly established county, west of Yuncheng), and Yunju (newly established county, south of Yuncheng) counties rushed to transport five million catties of fodder to rescue the situation. However, Chiang Kai-shek's troops along the way seized transport trucks. When they reached Dongkou (18 li north of Linpuji), the 428th Regiment of the 68th Division of Chiang Kai-shek's troops, which had invaded the area, frantically strafed, making rescue impossible. On the night of the 3rd, just as our Juancheng repair and defense section cadres were leading the masses to repair the embankment, Chiang Kai-shek's puppets suddenly attacked our repair and defense cadres, narrowly escaping disaster, but the masses still risked their lives to repair it. In order to further consolidate the embankment, the Juancheng Democratic Government decided to increase the height of the entire 6,600-meter embankment on the south bank of the Yellow River from Li Jinshi Hall to Zuoying by seven Chinese inches, but Chiang Kai-shek's aircraft bombed and strafed the section day and night. On the afternoon of the 6th alone, four Chiang Kai-shek aircraft harassed the area for as long as one and a half hours, dropping three bombs and firing more than 2,000 machine gun rounds, killing and wounding five innocent farmers in Menlou Village and piercing more than 20 civilian houses. Two boats used to rescue disaster-stricken people were destroyed. On the 7th, Chiang Kai-shek's heavy bombers again bombed and strafed Menlou, Shengqing, and Liqiao on the north bank. At 2 p.m. on the 8th, Chiang Kai-shek's troops fired more than 30 artillery shells from the Da Xingzhuang area on the south bank at the civilians repairing the embankment in the Niuqiao, Liqiao, and Sangzhuang areas on the north bank.

　　黄河南岸群众抢险自救
  　蒋军疯狂破坏形势危急
    【新华社晋冀鲁豫十二日电】蒋军于上月三十日侵陷鄄城临濮集，本月六日侵陷鄄城后，连日来破坏沿河堤工愈益疯狂。上月二十九日，江苏坝第三道坝缆绳第二次被蒋特割断二十五根，形势危急。我郓城、临濮（新设县，在郓城西部，）郓巨（新设县，在郓城县南，）三县群众赶运饲料五百万斤，奔往抢救。但蒋军沿路抢抓运输卡车，至董口（在临濮集北十八里）时侵至该处之蒋军六十八师四二八团疯狂扫射，抢险已无法进行。三日夜，正当我鄄城修防段干部领导群众修复堤岸时，蒋伪突然袭击我修防干部，险遭不测，但群众仍冒险奋力抢修。鄄城民主政府为进一步巩固堤岸，决增修黄河南岸，从李进士堂至左营长六千六百公尺之堤坝全部加高七公寸，但蒋机则昼夜不停向该段滥施轰炸扫射。六日下午一次，即有蒋机四架袭扰达一小时半之久，投弹三枚，扫射机枪二千余发，门楼村农民无辜死伤五人，射穿民房二十余间。打毁抢救受灾群众的船二艘。七日蒋重轰炸机复在门楼、盛庆、及北岸之李桥一带轰炸扫射。八日下午二时，蒋军更从南岸大邢庄一带，向北岸牛桥、李桥、桑庄一带增修堤防之民夫发炮三十余发。
