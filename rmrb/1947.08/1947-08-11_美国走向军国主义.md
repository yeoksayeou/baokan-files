　　Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 2nd: Washington dispatch: Truman signed the bill on the 26th to merge the army and navy to establish the Department of Defense, and at the same time appointed former Navy Secretary Forrestal as the first Secretary of Defense. The Department of Defense will have three non-cabinet-level secretaries, separately in charge of the Army, Navy, and Air Force. The Department of Defense also governs the following four agencies: (1) the Central Intelligence Agency, (2) the Joint Chiefs of Staff, (3) the Munitions Board, and (4) the Research and Development Board. According to the Washington Post observer, this is not only a change in the structure of the U.S. government, but also a "change in the nature of government." It is generally believed that this is one of the important steps for the United States to move towards militarism.

　　美国走向军国主义
    【新华社陕北二日电】华盛顿讯：杜鲁门于二十六日签署合并陆海军队成立国防部之法案，同时任命前海长福莱斯特尔为首任国防部长。国防部下将设非阁员地位之部长三人。分掌海陆空军三部。国防部并管辖下列四个机构：（一）中央情报局，（二）参谋长联席会议，（三）军火局，（四）研究发明局。据华盛顿邮报观察家评称：此不仅是美国政府机构之变更，亦为“政府性质之变更。”一般认为此乃美国走向军国主义的重要步骤之一。
