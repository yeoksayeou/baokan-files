Xinhua News Agency, Jin-Cha-Ji, 18th: The 40-li drainage canal in YuTian and Ji County, which began construction in April of this year, has now been completed. A total of 70,000 laborers were used, and a total of 200,000 mu of land were reclaimed from the 1,602 affected villages. The accumulated water in the Cangwa area of the first, eighth, and ninth districts of YuTian originally flowed into the Ji Canal through Xiaohekou; the accumulated water in the Taihewa area of the seventh and twelfth districts of Ji County flowed into the Ji Canal from Gaoguzi, but because the riverbed was silted up, the two areas of accumulated water had not been sown for nearly ten years, and the people's lives were difficult. The Wang and Ji County democratic governments formed a canal digging committee this year, digging a drainage canal from Zhangergao in Yangjiabanqiao, through Bajianfang, Fujiapu, Gujiapu, and Lujiaxiu. Sluice gates were built at Yangjiabanqiao and Liugu to prevent tidal water. The water level dropped more than three chi in two months. Except for Cangwa and Laopuzhuang, most of the accumulated water was drained, and the people have mostly completed the rush planting of late rice.

　　玉田蓟县修渠排水脱出土地二十万亩
    【新华社晋察冀十八日电】玉田、蓟县境内已达四十里的泄水渠于今年四月动工现已完成。总计用人工七万，在受灾的一千六百零二个村中，共脱出土地二十万亩。玉田一、八、九三个区之仓洼积水原由小河口入蓟运河；蓟县七、十二个区太和洼积水从高沽子入蓟运河，但因河底淤塞，两洼积水将近十年，未能播种，人民生活困难。王、蓟两县民主政府乃于今年组成挖渠委员会，北自杨家板桥的丈二高，经八间房、傅家铺、顾家铺、芦甲岫挖成一道泄水渠，杨家板桥及柳沽两处修闸，以防潮水。两个月水落三尺多，除仓洼、老蒲庄外，积水大部泄尽，人民抢种晚禾亦已大部完成。
