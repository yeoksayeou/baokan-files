Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 15th. Wedemeyer flew from Shanghai to Guangzhou today. Guangzhou Kuomintang officials have been extremely busy these past few days preparing to welcome the arrival of their American superior. "Both the provincial government and the municipal government have mobilized English secretaries to translate documents and charts to be submitted to Wedemeyer, while the Public Works Bureau has mobilized manpower to tidy up the main streets of the city" (United Press), displaying a completely servile attitude. Sources indicate that Wedemeyer's purpose for this trip is very broad, as the United States has long been interested in the Guangdong coast, the strategic position of South China, and its rich resources. According to an August 11th report in the Shanghai Ta Kung Pao: Guangdong has been selected as one of the "important bases" for the United States to train Kuomintang troops, and the United States has suggested to the Chiang government "to use Guangdong Province as the main base for unloading military supplies and provisions shipped to China." The Ta Kung Pao stated: "Wedemeyer's trip to Guangzhou is related to this plan." Meanwhile, according to a United Press dispatch from Hong Kong on the 12th: American entrepreneurs have drafted a "massive plan to develop the three provinces of Guangdong, Guangxi, and Hunan." The implementation of this plan requires an investment of $150 million, and the industries to be established and operated include the development of Huangpu Wharf, the establishment of a Guangzhou gas plant, cement plant, hydroelectric power plant, automobile factory, shipyard, glass factory, and the construction of highways. The contract for this plan has been signed between Mr. Bonnie, the head of the American Bonnie Lee Corporation who came to China, and the Chiang side. Mr. Bonnie returned to the United States on the 12th to obtain the approval of the US Export-Import Bank. Mr. Bonnie stated: These projects will be directly managed by Americans. China will need six to eight years to repay the US investment, principal and interest. This is an astonishingly huge plan by the United States to plunder Southern China under the Chiang government's policy of betrayal. It is widely believed that Wedemeyer's trip to Guangzhou for on-the-spot "investigation" is directly related to the US imperialist military and economic aggression plan against Southern China. According to sources in Shanghai, this matter has attracted the attention of the British in China, who are also calculating for their own interests and are unhappy about the expansion of American influence in Southern China. They often remember the US obstruction of the Sino-British commercial treaty negotiations since last year, and the fact that the United States incited the Chiang government to "take back" Hong Kong and replace it with actual American rule.

### 美国拟定庞大计划　图谋侵略华南　魏德迈赴广州与此直接有关

　　美国拟定庞大计划
  　图谋侵略华南
  　魏德迈赴广州与此直接有关
    【新华社陕北十五日电】魏德迈今日由沪飞广州。广州国民党官员数日来为准备迎接其美国上司的莅临，忙得不亦乐乎，“省政府和市政府双方都动员了英文秘书翻译递交魏德迈的文件和图表，同时公务局动员人力整理城内主要街道”（合众社），表现得奴相十足。各方消息显示，魏氏此行目的甚为广泛，美国老早以来即对广东海岸和南中国战略地位及其富源感到兴趣。据十一日上海大公报消息：广东已被选择为美国训练国民党军队的“重要基地”之一，美国并已向蒋政府建议“利用广东省为卸下输华军事物资与供应的主要基地”。大公报称：“魏德迈之赴广州与此计划有关”。同时，据合众社香港十二日电称：美国企业家已拟定“开发广东、广西、湖南三省之庞大计划”。该计划之实施需资一万万五千万美元，拟建立与经营之工业，包括发展黄埔码头、建立广州煤气厂、水泥厂、水力发电厂、汽车制造厂、造船厂、玻璃厂及修筑公路等。关于此项计划之合同，已由来华之美国波尼李氏总公司负责人波尼与蒋方订立合同，波氏已携此计划于十二日返美，以取得美国进出口银行之赞许。波氏称：这些工案将归美国人直接管理。中国方面为偿付美国投资，本利将需六年至八年之时间。这是美国在蒋政府出卖政策下掠夺华南之一惊人庞大计划。众信魏德迈赴广州实地“勘察”，与美帝国主义对华南的军事经济侵略计划有直接关系。据上海消息此事已引起在华英人之注意，他们亦为自己利益计算，对华南美国势力之伸展，持不乐意态度。他们常念念不忘去年以来中英商约谈判中美国从中阻挠，及美国鼓动蒋政府“收回”香港代以美国实际统治之事实。
