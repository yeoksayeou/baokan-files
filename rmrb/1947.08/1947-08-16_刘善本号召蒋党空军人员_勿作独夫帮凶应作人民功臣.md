Xinhua News Agency, Northeast, 14th—Liu Shanben, Zhang Shouyi, Tang Shiyao, Tang Yuwen, Ding Rusong, and other twelve former Kuomintang anti-civil war air force personnel, now in the Northeast Liberated Area, published a letter to their Kuomintang Air Force classmates and colleagues on the "August 14th" Chinese Air Force Day. It stated: As early as the Anti-Japanese War, Air Force personnel were constantly ordered to discuss topics such as "Methods to Restrict Communist Activities" and "How to Eliminate the Traitorous Party" in group meetings, brewing for civil war. We foresaw that there would definitely be a civil war in China after the Anti-Japanese War. Sure enough, after the "August 15th" surrender of the Japanese invaders, Chiang Kai-shek and the Communist Party signed the Double Tenth Agreement, but at the same time, he used this gap to send planes to transport large armies to North China and Northeast China, delivering bullets and weapons, actively preparing for civil war. Since the large-scale outbreak of civil war last year, the United States has continued to equip and train Chiang Kai-shek's army and air force, supplying military materials. The reactionaries constantly touted this as "helping China's rejuvenation," but looking back at the past: Gao Zhihang, the martyr who created the "August 14th" Air Force Day, used old "Hawk III" aircraft at the time. Why didn't the United States help us with airplanes then? When the Soviet Union sent a large number of volunteer air force soldiers and a large number of new aircraft to China to help fight the war, why did the United States still sell scrap iron to Japan? The fact is very clear: because Old Chiang sold China's sovereignty to the United States, American troops could be stationed in China, American ships could navigate inland rivers, and American planes could take off and land anywhere. Everything political, military, and economic was at the beck and call of the United States, even pilots who didn't know English were hindered from starting their engines and entering the field. Air Force colleagues and classmates, the eight years of the Anti-Japanese War saw tens of millions of deaths, the bloodstains of the dead are not yet dry, and the living have endured all kinds of torment. What was it all for? Can we tolerate this treasonous crime? The vast majority of us joined the Air Force to resist Japan and save the country. Now, if you ask yourselves in the dead of night: does bombing the liberated areas, bombing the banks of the Yellow River, and strafing peaceful people for Chiang Kai-shek align with your original aspirations? During the Anti-Japanese War, after the withdrawal from Xuzhou, Chiang Kai-shek ordered the Second Brigade to use SEB513 light bombers, temporarily painted with Japanese markings, to bomb the Yellow River embankment. The floodwater did not drown many Japanese, the real victims were the Chinese people and the Chinese army. Now Chiang Kai-shek is using this old trick again to bomb the Yellow River's dangerous works; colleagues and classmates, don't you know that this behavior is just a massacre of Chinese compatriots? In order to use the Air Force for civil war, Chiang Kai-shek deliberately relaxed military discipline. The Air Force can engage in independent operations (doing smuggling business), chasing women, running disguised brothel clubs, and handing out medals indiscriminately to satisfy young people's vanity. But did Chiang Kai-shek ever do this during the eight years of the Anti-Japanese War? In 1944, the pension for fallen pilots wasn't even worth the price of a pig. Rice subsidies were once fixed at 375 yuan, not enough to buy two pounds of rice. Pilots with tuberculosis had their salaries stopped after three months, and Gao Zhihang's son worked as a clerk in Kunming. Just these few facts can prove that Chiang Kai-shek treats the Air Force the same as other armies, buying them over and appeasing them when he needs them, and kicking them aside when he doesn't. Colleagues and classmates: We are all men of blood, we should stay true to our original intention and strive to build a Chinese Air Force that truly belongs to the people. The liberated areas are now implementing revolutionary Three People's Principles, and the people enjoy all freedoms and democracy. Even if you cannot come over immediately, you should do nothing to harm the interests of the people. Pilots should drop bombs in barren areas and shoot level during strafing. Officers and NCOs in the mechanical department should conduct strikes and work slowdowns and sabotage machinery. In short, do everything possible to sabotage their tools for carrying out civil war. Colleagues and classmates, space is limited. I hope we can all celebrate "August 14th" Air Force Day together in the liberated areas next year!

Xinhua News Agency, Northeast, 14th—Former KMT Air Force Captain Liu Shanben published an "Open Letter to the Kuomintang Air Force" on "August 14th." He first exposed Chiang Kai-shek's ugly pretense of being a "disciple" of Mr. Sun Yat-sen, and pointed out the crimes of civil war, dictatorship, and treason committed by the four families of Chiang, Soong, Kung, and Chen. Then he said: "Now there are only two paths before us: one is to be an accomplice of a tyrannical traitor, using American planes, bombs, and machine guns to massacre our own compatriots, while also inevitably dying in vain; the other is to resolutely withdraw from the civil war, defect to the liberated areas, and become a meritorious servant of the Chinese people, ending Chiang Kai-shek's fate as soon as possible. Whether you are a traitor to the nation or a meritorious servant of the people, the choice is up to us. I believe that most of you are waiting for an opportunity to choose the second path. In my experience, the easiest and most convenient way to come to the liberated areas is to turn your plane around and land in the liberated areas. There are hundreds of airports in the Northeast Liberated Area, and flat ground is everywhere in Central and North China, all of which can be used for safe landings. Today, as we commemorate our own holiday, I hope you will make a decisive decision, promote the patriotic spirit of "August 14th," and use all methods in every aspect and every corner to quickly end the traitorous and dictatorial Chiang gang." Captain Liu concluded, "Dear colleagues and classmates, see you in the liberated areas!"

### 刘善本号召蒋党空军人员　勿作独夫帮凶应作人民功臣

　　刘善本号召蒋党空军人员
  　勿作独夫帮凶应作人民功臣
    【新华社东北十四日电】现在东北解放区国民党反内战起义空军人员刘善本、张受益、唐世耀、唐玉文、丁如松等十二人于“八·一四”中国空军节发表告国民党空军同学同事书。略称：早在抗战期间，空军人员即不断奉命在小组会上讨论“限制共党活动办法”、“如何消灭奸党”等酝酿内战的题目，我们就预见到中国抗战后一定还有内战。果然“八·一五”日寇投降后，蒋介石和共产党签订了双十协定，但同时却利用这个空隙，派飞机把大军运到华北、东北，输送子弹、武器，积极布置内战。去年内战大打以后，美国继续替蒋介石装备和训练陆空军，输送军火物资，反动派不断鼓吹说这是“帮助中国复兴”，但返看过去的事实：创造“八·一四”空军节的烈士高志航当时用的是老旧的“霍克匹”机，为什么美国当时不帮助我飞机？当苏联派大批空军志愿兵及大批新式飞机来华助战时，美国为什么还卖废铁给日本？事实是很明显的：因为老蒋拍卖中国主权给美国，美国军队可以驻扎中国，美舰可以航行内河，美机可以随处起落，一切政治、军事、经济，无不唯美是听，甚至不会英文的飞行员连起机进场都遭到阻碍。空军同事同学们，抗战八年，死人千万，死者血迹未干，生者历尽折磨，所为何来？我们能容忍这种卖国罪行吗？我们绝大部分是为抗日救国而投入空军的，你们现在倘若深夜扪心自问：替蒋介石轰炸解放区，轰炸黄河堤岸，扫射和平人民，符合你们当初的志愿吗？在抗战时期徐州撤退之后，蒋介石命第二大队用临时涂上日本标帜的是ＳＥＢ５１３轻轰炸机炸黄河堤岸，黄水并没有淹死多少日本人，真正受害的还是中国人民和中国军队，现在蒋介石又用这种故技来轰炸黄河险工了；同事同学们，你们还不知道这种行为只是对中国同胞的大屠杀吗？蒋介石为了利用空军进行内战，故意放松军纪，空军可以跑单帮（做走私生意）、搞女人、办变相营妓的俱乐部、滥发勋章，满足青年人的虚荣心理。可是抗战八年中蒋介石可曾这样做过？一九四四年飞行员阵亡抚恤金抵不上一口猪的肉价，米津贴一度固定为三百七十五元，买不到二斤米。飞行员闹肺病三个月就停薪，高志航的儿子在昆明当勤务员。只举这几个事实，就可以证明蒋介石对空军和其他军队一样，用着的时候收买拉拢，用不着的时候一脚踢开。同事同学们：我们都是有血性的男儿，我们应该一本初衷，努力建设真正属于人民的中国空军。解放区现在实行了革命的三民主义，人民享有一切自由和民主。你们即使不能马上过来，也应做不违害人民利益的事情。飞行员投弹往荒地丢，扫射时平射，机械部门的官佐士，进行罢工怠工，破坏机件。总之，想尽一切办法破坏他们进行内战的工具。同事同学们，纸短言长，希望明年此日能在解放区一齐欢渡“八·一四”空军节！
    【新华社东北十四日电】前国民党空军上尉刘善本于“八·一四”发表“给国民党空军的一封公开信”。他首先揭穿蒋介石冒充孙中山先生的“信徒”的丑恶，并指出蒋宋孔陈四大家族内战、独裁、卖国的罪行。然后他说：“现在就只有两条路摆在我们面前：一条是作独夫卖国贼的帮凶，用美国的飞机炸弹机枪屠杀本国同胞，而自己也免不了枉死；一条是毅然退出内战，投奔解放区，作中国人民的功臣，早日结束蒋介石的命运。民族的罪人还是人民的功臣，就在我们自己选择了。我相信你们之中大多数都是待机选择第二条道路的，以我的经验，来解放区最容易最方便的方法，就是机头一转在解放区降落。东北解放区的机场达百个，华中和华北的平地到处都是，都可以作安全的降落。今天当我们纪念自己的节日的时候，希望你们当机立断，发扬“八·一四”爱国的精神，以各个方面各个角落用一切方法迅速结束蒋贼卖国独裁。”刘上尉最后说：“亲爱的同事、同学们，来解放区看见！”
