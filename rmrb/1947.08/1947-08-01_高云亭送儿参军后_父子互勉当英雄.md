    After Gao Yunting, a turned-over and production hero from Yuan Village, Tunliu, sent his son Quan Cai to join the army in February, he has now received a letter from his son reporting that he has become a model soldier. The father and son, both heroes, encourage each other in their correspondence, saying: "To defeat Chiang Kai-shek, we must be even more heroic and more of a model." His son wrote in his letter: "Since joining the army, although I don't know the situation at home, I saw in the Xinhua Daily on June 4th that you are a model worker, enthusiastic and devoted to your work, and your family is harmonious. Not only is production good, but you have also promoted production work in the whole village. I also learned that my younger sister, Quan Yuan, has also become a model. My daughter-in-law has also learned to weave cloth, and my elder sister-in-law weaves even better cloth. My elder brother is also working very hard. I hope you will work even harder in the future, save money and produce more, and always think of the masses. Be even more heroic and more of a model." Describing his life in the army, he said: "When we attacked Xiangning, Daning and other counties, we captured more than 3,000 enemy soldiers below the rank of regimental commander. Especially in the attack on Xiangning, the enemy's bunkers were like forests, but they couldn't withstand our attacks. We said that if we attacked that city, we would take it. My work is going smoothly, and my body is stronger than when I was at home. Everyone has also elected me as a model for enduring hardship and rescuing the wounded. I will definitely strive to be a hero again. Are you happy?..." Gao Yunting said in his reply to his son: "Everyone at home is healthy and working hard on production. The detailed situation is the same as what is said in the newspaper. You have become a model, and your elder brother, sister-in-law, and younger sister are all happy, saying it is the glory of the whole family. You said that we will meet again after defeating Chiang Kai-shek, and we will not be reunited until the reactionaries are eliminated. I will strive to be even more heroic and work hard for the whole family to be a model."

    高云亭送儿参军后
    父子互勉当英雄
    【本报太岳三十日电】屯留原村翻身生产英雄高云亭，自二月间动员他儿子全财参军后，现已接到他儿子来信报告已当了模范。父子英雄在相互的书信往还中互相鼓励说：“为了打败蒋介石要英雄再英雄、模范加模范”。他儿子来信说：“自参军以后，虽不知家中情形，但见六月四日新华日报上说：你是模范，工作积极热心，家庭和睦，不但生产好，还推动了全村生产工作。更知道我妹全员也成了模范。我媳妇也学会了织布，我大嫂织的布更好，我哥哥在劳动上也很努力。希望你以后更加努力节约生产，时刻要为群众着想，英雄再英雄、模范加模范。”叙述到自己在部队的生活情形时说：“在打乡宁、大宁等县时，活捉了敌人团长以下三千多人，特别是打乡宁，敌人碉堡像树林一样，但都顶不住我们打，我们说打那个城就要打下那个城。我的工作顺利，身体比在家还强，大家又选了我为吃苦耐劳救护伤员的模范。我一定要再争取当英雄。你高兴吗？……”高云亭于回答他儿子的信中说：“家里大小都健康，一股劲闹生产，详细情形和报上说的一样。你当了模范，你的哥哥嫂嫂妹妹都高兴的说是全家的光荣。你说的打败蒋介石再见面，消灭不了反动派不团圆，我要争取英雄再英雄，努力向前干全家，做模范。”
