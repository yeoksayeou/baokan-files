    Xinhua News Agency, Northeast, 5th. Chiang's troops in Shenyang are universally developing the sentiment of "surrendering when fighting." According to Shen Shijue, a sergeant squad leader of the Liao Bandit Security First Regiment who recently laid down his weapons: generally, middle and lower-ranking officers have lost confidence in attacking the People's Liberation Army. Many soldiers who were released after being captured by the PLA have been spreading the word about the "PLA's preferential treatment of prisoners of war." Therefore, a little ditty is popular internally: "The Eighth Route Army fights for the people, officers and soldiers are treated equally, capturing prisoners doesn't mean death." Soldiers are not as afraid of the high-pressure tactics of officers as they used to be. When they encounter officers scolding them, they mutter, "We'll meet on the battlefield." The other day, when a certain officer beat a soldier on the parade ground, everyone turned their heads away, making faces and saying, "We're going to Harbin and Qiqihar for training!"

    沈阳蒋军普遍厌战
    【新华社东北五日电】沈阳蒋军普遍滋长着“打仗就投降”的情绪。据最近放下武器的辽匪保一团中士班长沈世觉谈：一般中下级军官对于进攻人民解放军都已丧失信心，许多经解放军俘虏后释放的士兵，都纷纷传告着“八路军优待俘虏政策”，因此，内部流行着“八路军打仗为百姓，官兵讲平等，捉到俘虏不要命”的小调。士兵们对于官长的高压，已不感到以前那样可怕，他们遇到官长责骂的时候，便在嘴里嘟嚷着“到战场上见面”。日前某军官在操场上殴打士兵的时候，大家都把头一歪，扮着鬼脸说：“要到哈尔滨、齐齐哈尔去受训罗！”
