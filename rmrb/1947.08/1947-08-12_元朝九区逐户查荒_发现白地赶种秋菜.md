　　Yuan Dynasty's Ninth District Conducts Household-by-Household Investigation of Wasteland
　　Discovering Bare Land, Rushing to Plant Autumn Vegetables
　　[Our Newspaper, Jinnan, 10th Dispatch] Since the beginning of dog days, the Ninth District of Yuan Dynasty has been seizing the time to plant vegetables, buckwheat, and other crops to eliminate wasteland and increase production. Previously, each village in the Ninth District had conducted group-by-group, household-by-household inspections, discovering 90 *qing* of mature wasteland, sandy wasteland, and alkaline wasteland, and immediately called for planting vegetables to eliminate wasteland. Cadres and the masses in various villages responded enthusiastically and have now planted over 20 *qing* of radishes, alfalfa, rape, and rutabaga, and planted willows on over 30 *mu*. Alfalfa is planted on alkaline land (alfalfa nourishes the soil, and over time can turn alkaline land into good land), or red vitex is planted, with red vitex planted around the alkaline soil, and crops planted in the middle. Lin＠ Village digs the alkaline land into several kilns seven inches deep and seven inches square, filling them with good soil, and planting late seedlings and buckwheat. Because Zhongfantou Village has few livestock, after the rain, the village cadres led 200 women and children to reclaim 43 *mu* of raw wasteland in one day, planting 15 *mu* of radishes.
　　[Our Newspaper, Jinnan, 9th Dispatch] During the hot summer days, although various parts of Jinnan are vigorously rushing to plant radishes, vegetables, and buckwheat, in-depth inspections have still revealed a lot of wasteland, and a campaign to eliminate wasteland has now been launched. In Beitaitou Village, Sixth District of Zhangnan (newly established county), with livestock as the center, 180 cattle are divided into 18 groups, with four people per group, four plows, and four harrows, evenly distributing 35 *mu* of wasteland. First, the grass is cut, then the grass roots are dug up, and the women deliver tea and meals. In a three-day blitz, 630 *mu* of wasteland were reclaimed, and vegetables are being rushed to plant. The Fifth District inspected household by household, and in three days, 266.5 *mu* of wasteland were found. Beixiao District concentrated its efforts and planted five *mu* of buckwheat, four *mu* of rape, and 115 *mu* of mung beans in one day. In four days, the Party, government, and people of the First District blitzed and planted 35 *mu* of radishes, nine *mu* of corn, 49 *mu* of rape, 270 *mu* of mung beans, 166 *mu* of *jiaocao* (a kind of feed for livestock), and ten *mu* of buckwheat, leaving 84 *mu* of wheat land, which has been plowed, and the remaining 74 *mu* will also be plowed in preparation for planting buckwheat. Liang Anhai, the women's director of Longwangmiao Village in the Fourth District, personally led 25 women and children to blitz and weed ten *mu* of seedlings in one day, and is now rushing to plant radishes and buckwheat.
