　　Xingtai Canal Construction Brings Permanent Benefits
  　Transforming Over 50,000 Mu of Dry Land
    [Report from our reporters on the 17th] Xingtai farmers have put forward the slogan "Long-term drought prevention, permanent benefit," and are actively engaged in water conservancy construction. The Second District has repaired more than 50 *li* of old canals (excluding branch canals), irrigating 12,000 *mu* of land, and newly built five new canals, capable of irrigating 7,000 *mu* of land. By the end of June, the New District had already dug 118 wells, capable of irrigating 1,834 *mu*. When Lvjiatun discussed repairing canals to transform more than 300 *mu* of dry alkaline land south of the village, everyone said, "This is impossible." However, Hou Guangren said, "As long as everyone works hard, nothing is impossible. If the canal south of the village is well repaired, it will guarantee an extra 300 bags of grain every year from the 300 *mu* of dry alkaline land." After his calculation, everyone's enthusiasm immediately rose. They immediately made a canal repair plan, with each worker opening three *zhang* per day, and clearly divided the work on the spot. As a result, 67 full laborers and 36 semi-laborers completed the canal (the canal is 765 *zhang* long in total). Now, they have irrigated the 300 *mu* of alkaline land once and planted buckwheat and vegetables on all of it. Zhangdong Village has completed seven new wells, repaired four old wells, and made five new waterwheels, which can irrigate 200 *mu* of land. Changxin Village has built a large canal that is five and a half *li* long, using 2,000 workdays. They are now repairing branch canals, and 4,000 *mu* of dry land have been turned into paddy fields. The masses of Zhao Village have repaired two old water pits, with an area of 30 square *zhang*, and dug another seven *chi* deeper, which can store 72,000 *dan* of water, enough to plant 360 *mu* of cotton next year. According to very incomplete statistics, a total of 1,115 *zhang* and 59 and a half *li* long canals have been repaired, as well as 40 more, and a total of 141 wells have been dug, turning 57,736 *mu* of dry land into irrigated land.

    [Report from our reporters on the 17th] Xingtai County has built a 15-*li*-long drainage canal, turning 10,000 *mu* of waterlogged land into fertile fields. Li Dao Village, Hequ Village, Da Lü Village, Xin Shengpu and other villages are the four famous depressions in Xingtai, each fifteen *li* long and wide. When rainfall is moderate in other areas, this area is a vast expanse of water. Before the War of Resistance, although most of the land could be cultivated, it was only for one year at a time, harvesting some sorghum. In the past, there was a folk rhyme describing the suffering of the farmers in the four depressions of Xingtai: "The four depressions of Xingtai, it's hard to eat sorghum paste and hard to wash the pot (made of red sorghum flour), daughters cannot marry him!" After the War of Resistance, due to the Japanese occupation for several years, farmers could not even grow sorghum. Weeds grew everywhere, a scene of desolation. For example, Li Dao Village could cultivate more than 40 *qing* of land before the War of Resistance, but now it only cultivates 17 *qing*. In order to relieve the people's suffering from floods, the Xingtai Democratic Government has helped local farmers build a huge drainage canal this year, which has been fully completed, using a total of 4,000 workdays, turning more than 10,000 *mu* of waterlogged land into fertile fields.

　　邢台修渠永远得利
  　改造旱地五万余亩
    【本报记者团十七日电】邢台农民提出“长期防旱，永远得利”的口号，积极兴修水利。二区修复旧渠五十余里（支渠未统计），浇一万二千亩地，新修五道新渠，能浇七千亩地。新区至六月底，已打井一百一十八眼，能浇一千八百三十四亩。吕家屯在讨论修渠改造村南三百余亩旱碱地时，大家都说：“这是办不到的事”，侯光仁却说：“只要大家一个劲，没有办不到的事。村南修好渠，保证三百亩旱碱地每年多收三百布袋粮食。”经过他这一计算，大家的劲马上起来了，当场做修渠计划，一个工每天开三丈，当场明确的分了工。结果六十七个整劳力，三十六个半劳力把渠修成（渠长共七百六十五丈），现已将三百亩碱地浇了一遍，全部种上荞麦和菜。张东村已修成七眼新井，修复四眼旧井，新制水车五辆，可浇地二百亩。长信村已修起五里半长的大渠，用工两千个，现正修支渠，四千亩旱地已变成水田。赵庄群众修好两个旧水坑，面积三十方丈，深处又掘了七尺，可存水七万二千担，来年可点花三百六十亩。据极不完全统计，共修渠一千一百一十五丈又五十九里半长，又四十道，共打井一百四十一眼，使五万七千七百三十六亩旱地变为水地。（波）
    【本报记者团十七日电】邢台县兴修十五里长的排水渠，使一万亩水淹地变为良田。李道村、河曲村、大吕村、辛升铺等村是邢台有名的四大洼，纵横各十五里，在其他地区雨水调和时，该地是一片汪洋。抗战前虽然大部土地能种，也仅是赶年头，收些高粱。过去有打油诗描述四大洼农民的苦景云：“邢台四大洼，浆糊涂难吃锅难刷（红高粱面做的），有女不能嫁给他！”抗战后，由于日寇盘踞数年，农民连高梁也不能种了，野草丛生，一片荒芜。如李道村抗战前能种四十余顷地，现在才种十七顷。邢台民主政府为解除群众水患，今年帮助当地农民修筑巨大的排水渠，已全部完成，共用工四千个，使一万余亩水淹地变为良田。（波）
