    The Textile Craze in Cejing
    Li Zhuang
    [Report from our Correspondents' Group, 9th] This reporter arrived at Shahejing Town at 9 PM on the 5th and witnessed three women's spinning groups on a street approximately 100 meters long. They possessed thirty-three spinning wheels operating simultaneously, humming busily. Each group had one oil lamp, and many spinning wheels were placed next to rice bowls. When asked with a smile by the reporter "Why are you all so active?" the women replied: "We women are relying on these wheels to survive the famine!" At this moment, the summer heat was receding, and a breeze was blowing. There were no women relaxing on the street; young girls and old women were all diligently spinning. This reporter interviewed the village chief and political director of Northeast Street Village. According to them, the street has over five hundred and twenty people, with ninety-five spinning wheels and twenty-four looms. Almost every able-bodied woman has an average of one spinning or weaving tool. They said: Now, spinning and weaving are the most profitable. Spinning one jin of cotton can earn wages of five jin of rice. The women in the village can spin an average of six liang per day, earning two jin of rice in wages daily. According to their estimate, the income from spinning and weaving by the women in the street accounts for one-third of the total income of the farmers. This reporter asked: "Why is it possible to do such a good job with spinning and weaving at this time?" After a moment of contemplation, they said: "This is all thanks to the benefits of liberation. Now spinning and weaving are the most profitable. Before the war, the landlords controlled the cotton yarn shops. Spinning one jin of cotton into thread could only earn at most two jin of rice. The thread was weighed with a twenty-six liang scale, and the rice was weighed with a sixteen liang scale, and it was still not easy to sell! Now, the cooperative distributes cotton, collects cloth, and pays wages, so all problems are gone." They also said: "Here, the years thirty-one and thirty-two were great famines. The people have learned from experience. This year, as soon as we mobilized, the women said, "We must work hard. In those two years, there were still rich people, and the government could still help us borrow grain from them. Now the rich people are gone, so we have to rely on ourselves." The active spinning and weaving of women has also broken traditional habits. In the past, women would make shoe soles during the dog days of summer, but this year they are not doing so: "Surviving the famine is the most important thing!" This is what the women are all saying.

    册井的纺织潮

    【本报记者团九日电】记者于五日下午九时行抵沙河井镇，在长约百米的一条街上，目睹三个妇女纺花集团，拥有纺车三十三辆同时转动，嗡嗡作声。每个集团共有一盏油灯，许多纺车旁边还放着饭碗。纺妇们含笑回答记者“为什么这样积极”的问题时说：“我们妇女就要靠这辆车子渡荒哩”！此时暑退风来，街上无一乘凉妇女，小女孩和老太婆都在勤劳纺花。记者访问东北街村长及政治主任，据称：该街共五百二十余人，有纺车九十五辆，织布机二十四张，能劳动的妇女几乎每人平均一纺织工具。他们说：现在纺织利润最大，纺一斤线可得工资五斤米，该村纺妇每天每人平均可纺六两，日得工资米二斤。据他们估计该街妇女纺织收入，相当农民收入总数三分之一。记者问：“为什么这时候能把纺织搞好呢？”彼等稍一沉吟即说：“这都是翻身的好处，现在纺织利润最大，抗战前地主们把持棉纱店，一斤花纺成线顶多能赚两斤米，线是廿六两秤，米是十六两秤，还不容易卖出去！这时候合作社发花收布给工资，一切问题都没了。”又说：“这里三十一、三十二年都是大灾荒，老百姓有了经验，今年咱们一动员，妇女们就说：“得好好干，那两年还有老财，政府还能帮助咱们向他们借粮，现在老财也没了，得靠自己。”妇女积极纺织又打破传统习惯，过去伏天都要纳鞋底子，今年也不纳了：“渡荒要紧”！妇女们都这样说。
