　　Sacrificing Himself to Save Comrades, Refusing to Surrender His Gun!
　　Militia Member Wang Mingyi Unyielding and Heroic
　　[Our newspaper's dispatch from the Hebei-Shandong-Henan area] Comrade Wang Mingyi is a very honest militia member from Wanggang Village, Eighth District, Yunbei County. He is 37 years old. After the Chiang troops occupied the county this spring, he led the masses in the village to persist in the struggle against the enemy. On the evening of the 11th day of the second lunar month, our district cadres went to the village to hold a mass meeting to carry out war mobilization. On the morning of the 12th, the enemy suddenly surrounded Wanggang Village from three stations in multiple directions, attempting to capture our district cadres and militia members. Comrade Mingyi discovered this. The enemy was very close. Because he was outnumbered, Comrade Mingyi quickly and skillfully hid his gun and dealt with the enemy together with the masses, protecting the safety of the district cadres. Wang Mingyi and Comrade Li ×× (a militia member) were eventually captured by the enemy, who cursed them, "You Eighth Route Army skins, you won't tell the truth without using force!"

　　After Wang Mingyi was captured, he had a plan in his heart. He thought this way along the road: First, the district cadres are the leaders of the masses. Even if I sacrifice myself, I cannot tell where they live. Second, since the enemy is calling me an Eighth Route Army skin, they must have seen that I am a militia member. When they ask, I will admit it first, save Comrade Li Geng, and let him escape with his life. I'll take the blame myself. Third, since I have admitted that I am a militia member, the enemy will definitely ask me for my gun, but I will never reveal where my gun is, even if I die. Anyway, being captured by the enemy means certain death. Even if I tell the truth, I will still die. Only by sacrificing myself can I protect this gun. It will be very glorious when the masses hold a memorial service for me in the future.

　　When the enemy bound Mingyi and Li Geng and arrived at Chen Station, they first asked Mingyi, "Are you two militia members?" At this time, Mingyi had the opportunity to save Li Geng. He said generously, "I am a militia member, he is a civilian!" The enemy then asked Li Geng, "Are you a civilian?" Li Geng said, "Indeed!" At this time, the enemy was deceived and released Li Geng. Then the enemy asked Mingyi for his gun. Mingyi said, "The gun has already been handed over to the district headquarters!" They asked again, "Where did the district cadres go?" Mingyi said, "I don't know!" At this time, the enemy cursed angrily, "Eighth Route Army skin, damn it! You won't tell the truth without using force!" So a group of enemies, like mad dogs, pressed Comrade Mingyi to the ground. They beat him twenty times with big sticks for the first time, forty times for the second time, and hung him on a tree and beat him all over with leather shoes for the third time. Mingyi could not stand straight, and it was difficult to move a step. This group of mad dogs still wanted the gun and were looking for cadres. Comrade Mingyi still firmly said, "The gun was handed over to the district headquarters, I don't know where the district cadres went!" The enemy then threatened him with "death," tied him up, and took him out. When they pulled him outside the village, they asked him again for the gun. Comrade Mingyi still gave the same answer. Because the enemy did not get the gun, they押回来 him back. During the two months that Mingyi was captured, his arms were never untied. When the enemy went to Tai'an, they took Mingyi to Tai'an. When our army liberated Tai'an, Comrade Mingyi was also liberated and returned.

　　Comrade Mingyi was in high spirits after returning, saying, "The Eighth Route Army is truly my savior!" He quickly dug out his gun, carried it on his shoulder, and said, "I must avenge this!" Comrade Mingyi's revolutionary integrity of unyielding to the death is admired and emulated by everyone. (Xiaoliang)

　　舍身救同志，宁死不缴枪！
  　民兵王明义威武不屈
    【本报冀鲁豫讯】王明义同志是郓北县第八区王岗庄一个最老实的民兵，现年三十七岁，今春蒋军进占该县后，在村里领导群众坚持了对敌斗争。古历日二月十一日晚，我区干部到该村召开群众大会，进行战争动员，十二日上午，敌由三站分数路突然包围王岗庄，企图捕捉我区干和民兵，当被明义同志发觉，敌人已离的很近，这时明义同志因寡不抵众，即机动的迅速把枪埋藏起来，和群众在一起应付敌人，掩护了区干部的安全。王明义、李××同志（民兵）终被敌捕去了，并大骂他俩：“你们这八路皮，不动武刑总是不肯说实话。”
    王明义被捕后，内心就打好了算盘，一路上他这样想：一、区干部是群众的领导者，我就牺牲了也不能说出他们在那里住。二、敌人既骂我八路皮，他一定看出我是民兵，问时我先承认了，把礼更同志救出去，叫他逃个活命，留下我一个人顶吧。三、我既承认了我是民兵，敌人一定问我要枪，但我死也不能说出我的枪来，反正敌人抓住就只有一死，咱就说了实话，也是死，只有牺牲自己，保护下这支枪，将来群众给我开个追悼会也是光荣的很。
    当敌人捆着明义和礼更到了陈站时，先问明义：“你两个是民兵吧？”这时明义得到了救出礼更的机会，他即慷慨的说：“我是民兵，他是老百姓！”敌人又问礼更：“你是个老百姓？”礼更说：“真是！”这时敌人受骗了，当时把礼更放走。接着敌人就向明义要枪，明义说：“枪早就交到区部啦！”又问：“区干部那里去了？”明义说：“不知道！”这时敌人恶恨恨的大骂起来：“八路皮，狗日的！不动武刑总不说实话！”于是一群敌人象疯狗一样把明义同志按倒在地，首次打了二十大棍，第二次打了他四十大棍，第三次吊在树上用皮鞋混身上下打了个遍，打的明义不能直身，寸步难行，这群疯狗还是要枪，找干部，明义同志仍坚定不移的说：“枪交区部，区干部不知道那儿去了！”敌人又用“死”来威胁他，把他捆上解出去，当拉到村外时，再问他要枪，明义同志仍原话答复，敌人因为没有要出枪来，又把他押回来。在明义被捕两个多月中，两膀上从未下过绳，敌人到泰安时，又把明义带到泰安，我军解放泰安时，明义同志也被解放回来。
    明义同志回来后情绪很高，说：“八路军真是我的救命人！”又很快挖出自己的枪来，扛到肩上，还说：“总得报报这个仇！”明义同志这种至死不屈的革命气节，人人敬佩，个个学习。（效良）
