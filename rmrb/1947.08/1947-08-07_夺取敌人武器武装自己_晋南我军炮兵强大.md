Xinhua News Agency, Southern Shanxi Front, 5th. Our special correspondent Mu Xin reports: The artillery of General Chen Geng's troops was almost entirely "helped" into existence by the Chiang and Yan armies. Yan Xishan was the most diligent in delivering equipment. During the Shangdang Campaign in October 1945, Hu Sanyu, the artillery commander-in-chief of the Yan army, "escorted" twenty-two mountain guns drawn from three artillery regiments and "delivered" them to us. Hu Zongnan was also generous. Last summer, the 31st Brigade was ordered to deliver four Type 92 infantry guns and two anti-tank rifles to the 167th Brigade. As a result, these guns and rifles were captured by the People's Liberation Army during the annihilation of the 31st Brigade in the Wenxi-Xia County campaign before they even met the 167th Brigade. In the Fushan campaign last September, when Hu Zongnan's 1st Brigade was annihilated, Brigade Commander Huang Zhengcheng brought four long-range Type 94 guns, fifteen rocket launchers, and three anti-tank guns, all freshly equipped from Shuyang. The rocket launchers had never even been used. In a certain regiment, this reporter saw a certain company's twelve rocket launchers and anti-tank guns, all brand-new American-made. The Chiang and Yan armies also sent well-trained artillerymen along with the guns. Many of them are still with their original guns after liberation. The artillery officers of the People's Liberation Army now value these artillerymen very much, praising them for their bravery and flexibility. Yang Fugui, a liberated soldier, only made it to deputy squad leader in the Yan army's 28th Regiment after five years. However, after joining the People's Liberation Army, he was promoted to squad leader within a year due to his military merits and became a glorious Communist Party member. Many people like Yang Jiong have become platoon leaders, and Chen Yuding has been promoted to deputy instructor. They are now serving the people with infinite loyalty and skillful techniques. Zhou Wenman's company fired a total of 228 shells during the entire Southern Shanxi campaign, hitting 221, destroying 47 large and small bunkers, and six targets. During the Ronghe battle when attacking the east gate, Yang Fugui's second shell hit the city tower through the hole made by the first shell. Because it was not obstructed, it flew to the west city and drilled into a hidden bunker, killing eight enemy soldiers inside. In the southwest corner of Yuncheng, one shot destroyed an enemy heavy artillery piece. During the Linfen campaign, the artillery even climbed the city walls with the infantry, using ropes to hoist the thousand-pound mountain guns piece by piece onto the city towers and firing fiercely at the enemy. They created many miracles in battle.

Xinhua News Agency, Southern Shanxi Front, 5th. The Yang Youcai squad of General Chen Geng's artillery was awarded the honorary title of "Tough Bone Squad" during the Southern Shanxi campaign. Squad leader Yang Youcai is a liberated soldier. Their gun fired a total of 79 shells during the Southern Shanxi campaign, with 76 hitting the target. In early May, during the battle on the outskirts of Yuncheng, they were ordered to bombard the large bunker in the southwest corner of the city with a single gun. They built a position in an open area, no more than 500 meters from the enemy's farthest firing point. Under the intense enemy fire and the repeated strafing and bombing by three enemy planes, they persisted for five hours. More than 100 shells landed around their position. In the end, they carried the 1,400-pound gun piece by piece into the position and assembled it. They fired eleven shots in a row, turning the large bunker held by a company of Chiang's soldiers into a pile of rubble. Finally, they disassembled the gun and transported it back under the bombardment of six enemy mortars. Squad leader Yang Youcai and gunner Yang Haibang were both slightly wounded. At the war summary, eight of the ten members of the squad were commended for their merits, and Yang Youcai was listed as a special-class hero.

    夺取敌人武器武装自己
    晋南我军炮兵强大
    【新华社晋南前线五日】本社特派记者穆欣报导：陈赓将军所部炮兵几乎全是蒋阎军“帮忙”建设起来的。运送得最殷勤的首推阎锡山，四五年十月上党战役阎军炮兵中将总司令胡三余“押着”由三个炮兵团抽出的二十二门山炮，一起“运送”过来。胡宗南也不吝啬，去年夏天卅一旅奉令给一六七旅送四门九二式步兵炮，二挺战防枪，结果这些炮和枪未与一六七旅见面即都在闻（喜）夏（县）战役中被人民解放军歼灭三十一旅时所俘获。去年九月浮山战役胡宗南的第一旅被歼灭时，旅长黄正成又带来四门远射程的九四式，十五个火箭筒，三门战防炮，都是刚从沭阳装备好的，火箭筒还根本没有用过。记者在某旅看到某连的十二门火箭炮与战防炮，全是崭新的美国造。蒋阎军还随炮整批送来训练有素的炮手，他们中许多人解放后都还和他原来的炮在一起。解放军的炮兵长官们现都很器重这些炮手，夸奖他们勇敢而灵活，解放战士杨福桂过去在阎军二十八团，五年才混上一个副班长，可是到解放军来才一年，便已由战功而提升为班长，而且还成了光荣的共产党员。杨炯等许多人都当了排长，陈玉鼎则被升为副指导员，他们现在皆以无限的忠勇和熟练的技术为人民服务，周文满连在整个晋南战役期间，共发炮二百廿八发，击中二百二十一发，打垮了大小碉堡四十七座，目标六个。荣河战斗攻东门的时候，杨福桂的炮打城楼时第二颗弹由第一颗弹孔中射过去，因为没有受到阻碍，结果飞射到西城钻进了一个暗碉里炸死了碉内八个敌军。在运城西南角一炮打掉敌人一个重炮。在临汾作战中，炮兵竟随步兵登城，把千余斤重的山炮逐件用绳吊到城楼上去，向敌人猛烈的射击。他们在战斗中，创造了许多奇迹。
    【新华社晋南前线五日电】陈赓将军所部炮兵杨有才班，晋南战役中获得“硬骨头班”的光荣称号。班长杨有才是解放战士，他们这门炮在晋南战役共发射炮弹七十九发，有七十六发命中目标。五月上旬运城外围战斗时，他们奉令单炮轰击城西南大碉堡。在开阔地带构筑阵地，距离敌人最远火力点也不过五百公尺，在敌密人集炮火及三架敌机轮番扫射轰炸下，坚持五小时，阵地前后落炮弹百余发，终将一千四百斤重的炮，逐件背入阵地装好，连打十一发，把蒋军一个连据守的大碉堡，打成一堆瓦砾。最后又冒敌人六门迫击炮的轰击，把炮拆卸运回，班长杨有才和炮手杨海邦都受了轻伤。在总结战役时，全班十人，有八人立功，杨有才更列为特等功臣。
