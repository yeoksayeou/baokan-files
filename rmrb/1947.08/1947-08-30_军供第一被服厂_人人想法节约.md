　　Army Supply No. 1 Clothing Factory
　　Everyone Thinks of Saving
　　[Our Newspaper] The No. 1 Clothing Factory of the Military Region Supply Department, under the slogan "Every inch of cloth and every thread is the blood and sweat of the people; saving materials is reducing the burden on the people," has achieved remarkable results in saving. The fifth group, which used to waste thread, has tightened up on saving. Wang Genrong, the leader of the seventh group, educated apprentices not to mess up when unwinding thread, saving more than five catties of thread a month; the dyehouse used cloth pots to boil oak bark, saving 100 catties of coal a day; the tailoring room has even greater enthusiasm, with everyone offering ideas and thinking of ways to use the small pieces of cloth left over from cutting cotton clothes to make hat brims, small strips of cloth to make hatbands, and even smaller pieces of cloth to make pocket flaps. They try to use as much as possible of what can become materials, leaving no scraps of cloth as small as an inch. The group leader, Comrade Shen Tianwang, carefully explored and researched using one chi three of cloth as the standard, separating the large size from the second size to cut. With the efforts of all comrades in the group, more than 12,800 square chi of cloth were saved in more than 20,000 sets of cotton clothes, an average of 64 square cun saved per set, creating unprecedented great achievements.

　　[Our Newspaper] After three months of a great production campaign in a certain military factory, the consciousness and political awareness of the working class have been raised, and progress has been made in their understanding of the factory. Workers have reduced their wages to one-third. In production, previously X number of people could only do four pieces of work a day. After identifying and struggling against 42 targets, production did not decrease, and the quality improved a lot.
　　Under the slogan of worker-peasant unity in support of the front lines, five comrades, including workers Li Chengbao and Guo Youjian, donated three months' wages. Comrade Wang Gengyin will donate ten catties of rice of wages every month until Chiang Kai-shek is defeated. In terms of saving, such as the tools used, rasps, saw blades, sandpaper, and oil, a lot has been saved. In the past, one piece of sandpaper was used for one piece of work, now two pieces of sandpaper are used for three pieces of work. (Taihang First Military Subdistrict Workers' Union)

　　军供第一被服厂
  　人人想法节约
    【本报讯】军区供给部第一被服厂，在“一寸布一根线都是老百姓的血汗，节省材料就是减轻人民负担”的口号下，节约上获得显著成绩。一贯用线浪费的第五组，严加节约，七组组长王根荣同志，教育学徒倒线不要乱，一个月节省五斤多线；染坊利用成布锅熬橡壳，一日节省一百斤煤炭；裁剪房劲头更大，个个出主义，人人想办法，把裁棉衣剩下的小块布裁帽檐，小布条裁帽带，再小的布块接口袋盖，能成材料者尽量利用，不留一方寸大的碎布，组长申天旺同志，细心摸索，研究出以尺三的布为标准，大二号分开裁，在全组同志努力下，二万余套棉衣中，节省一万二千八百方尺布，平均每套节省六十四方寸，创造了从来未有的大成绩。（葛钦）
    【本报讯】一分武工厂，经过三个月大生产运动，职工阶级觉悟、政治觉悟提高，对工厂认识都有了进步。工人把自己的工资降低到三分之一。生产上以前×××人，一天能作四件活，清理出斗争对象四十二人，生产上并不降低，且在质量上提高了很多。
    在支援前线工农团结口号下，工人李成保、郭有建等五个同志，献出三个月工资。王更银同志每月要献出工资米十斤，至打垮蒋介石为止。节约上如使用的工具、搓刀、锯条、沙布、油等，都节省的很多，过去一件活用一张沙布，现在三件活用二张。（太行一分区职工会）
