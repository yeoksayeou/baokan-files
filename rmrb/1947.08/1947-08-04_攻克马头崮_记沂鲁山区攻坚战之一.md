    Conquering Matou Gu
    One of the Key Battles in the Yishu Mountain Area

    [Xinhua News Agency, East China Front, 2nd] After the East China People's Liberation Army successively captured high grounds such as Taiping Peak and Fenghuang Mountain on the south bank of the Yi River, they directly attacked Matou Gu (north of Nanma) on the night of the 19th. This mountain stands on the north bank of the Yi River, with precipitous cliffs reaching a height of 652 meters. On top of it was built a stone stronghold more than 13 meters high, surrounded by honeycomb-like concealed bunkers and pillboxes. One battalion of the 52nd Regiment of the 18th Brigade of the Kuomintang's reorganized 11th Division stubbornly resisted inside. Dense artillery fire swept downwards. The valiant soldiers of the People's Liberation Army climbed the steep mountain path amidst wind and rain, fiercely attacking the Kuomintang troops. After fierce fighting until 3:00 AM, they occupied the stone stronghold in the northeast and the mountain top in the northwest, compressing all the Kuomintang troops onto the oval-shaped summit. The next morning, a light fog enveloped the mountain peak, and the People's Liberation Army bombarded the top of the mountain with dense artillery fire. For a time, thick smoke and flames engulfed the entire summit. The infantry then launched an assault. Three warriors from a combat team of a certain battalion were the first to scale the cliff and ascend to the top. Subsequent troops then surged upwards like waves. The strategically important Matou Gu was finally conquered, and all the defending enemies were wiped out without a single one escaping.

    攻克马头崮
    记沂鲁山区攻坚战之一
    【新华社华东前线二日电】华东解放军连克沂河南岸太平顶、凤凰山等高地后，十九日晚直取马头崮（在南麻以北）。该崮矗立沂河北岸，悬崖峭壁，高达六百五十二公尺，上面筑有十三公尺多高的石圩子，团团围绕着蜜蜂窝似的蔽射碉地堡。蒋军整编第十一师十八旅五二团的一个营钻在里面顽抗，密集的炮火向下扫射，解放军勇士们在风雨交作中攀登陡峻的山道，痛击蒋军，激战至午夜三时，占领崮东北的石圩子和西北的山头，把蒋军全部压缩到椭圆形的山顶上。次日清晨，薄雾笼罩山峰，解放军以密集炮火向崮顶轰击。一时浓烟烈焰吞没整个崮顶，步兵们随即冲锋，某营一个战斗小组的三勇士首先攀越悬崖，登上崮顶，后续部队乃如波翻涛涌跟踪而上。天险马头崮终被攻克，守敌全部就歼，无一漏网。
