First Military Supply Clothing Factory: Learn Well, Perform Well, Improve Work

[This Newspaper Reported] Since the First Military Supply Clothing Factory launched the "Learn Well, Record Well" campaign, morale has been soaring. Comrade Wen Bin, despite being ill, cut military caps, ensuring none of the eight machines were idle. Wang Baolin and Du Dong immediately sewed on sleeves, not even taking a break at noon. During the "Learn Well, Record Well" campaign, they also put forward the slogan: "Welcome 'August 1st', hold a grand commendation!" Consequently, work and learning have made significant progress. Sun Pei, a comrade in the dyeing workshop, noticed that carrying water to fill the pot was slow, so he carried the water himself without using a shoulder pole, carrying two buckets in his hands. He poured water quickly, saving half the time. He was not afraid of fatigue and stood in front of the pot every day to boil oak shells until the stars came out in the sky. Comrade Zhao Dewen from the dyeing workshop was determined to record well and came up with a new method: not using fire in the afternoon, but using the ready-made cloth pot (the dyeing pot) to boil oak shells. Compared to boiling oak shells with a separate fire, this could save 100 catties of coal per day, equivalent to 3,000 yuan. Under the slogan "Progress in learning can also be recorded as a good deed," the enthusiasm of the workers for learning was high. Comrade Hu Xiaoliu, the leader of the trade union group, and others led the whole group to study under the lamp in the evening. Comrades said, "We are a factory during the day, and we become a school at night!" (Ge Qin)

[This Newspaper Reported] The Third Clothing Factory of the Military Region Supply Department, along with all its employees, has once again launched a campaign to contribute labor and funds to practice production and thrift in commemoration of "August 1st." Comrade Jing Ming from the tailoring group took the lead by representing the entire group in offering five days of labor and a salary of 80,000 yuan to "August 1st." Then, Wang Ruzhen, the leader of the seventh group, Wang Fuyuan, the inspector, Zhao Zhenhe, the deputy director of the factory, and Yan Yushan, the head of the machine repair group, each contributed 10,000 yuan. Liu Zenglin, the leader of the fourth group, came despite being ill and said, "The fourth group will contribute 15,000 yuan!" Doctor Lian Ruan said, "I will donate half a year's allowance to 'August 1st'." The administrative chief donated a set of undershirts. In this way, some donated 5,000, others 3,000, totaling 353,100 yuan. Everyone said in unison, "Doing this is not enough, we must continue to save and support the long-term war." Comrade Wang Shiming said: "Starting from 'August 1st', save 3,000 yuan every month until Chiang Kai-shek is defeated!" Zhao Zhenhe will save 10,000 yuan every month, the fourth group 10,000 yuan, and Pan Cong will save 30 catties of millet every month. Some will save 20 catties, others 10 catties. The young apprentice Su Qingtai said: "I will also save 5 catties of millet every month until Chiang Kai-shek is captured." In this way, a total of 1,146 catties of millet will be saved every month to support the patriotic self-defense war. In addition, all the employees of the factory are organizing Yangko dance teams and other entertainment rehearsals in preparation for launching various major competitions on "August 1st."
