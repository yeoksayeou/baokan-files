Xinhua News Agency, Jinji-Luyu, 25th: The Taihang Xinhua Daily and Xinhua Branch held a communication and reporting conference on August 2nd, which concluded on the 23rd. Forty-six representatives from various special counties and more than twenty people from the newspaper and news agency attended. During the conference, Comrade Leng Chu from the District Party Committee gave personal guidance. Comrade Yuan Bo from the People's Daily and Comrade An Gang from the General Branch also came from afar, bringing encouragement and expectations from Comrades Liao Chengzhi and Zhang Pan Shi.

The attending representatives reported on rural communications and reporting over the past year, as well as various mass creations. Among them, the experience of Licheng in mobilizing the entire people to write articles, the experience of Duan Pengxiang, a cadre in Shexian District, in implementing mutual assistance between workers, peasants, and intellectuals to promote the establishment of communication groups, and the experience of Heshun in starting from ideological understanding, leading comrades personally writing, and backbone correspondents taking the lead in launching communication movements, all demonstrated the significant progress of communication work over the past year.

How newspapers can connect with the masses was also a central issue of heated discussion at the conference. Attending representatives exchanged experiences in running small newspapers by following the mass line over the past year. There are a total of 126 kinds of small newspapers in the 40+ counties across the region, becoming the most powerful weapon for connecting with the masses, promoting central work, recognizing models and spreading experiences. At the same time, many valuable opinions were put forward to the major newspapers, the most important of which was the hope to further strengthen the mass viewpoint, face the workers and peasants, and implement popularization.

On the 16th, Comrade Liao Chengzhi's instructions were conveyed, calling on journalists to launch a standpoint examination movement in the land reform movement, consciously stand on the side of the peasants, eliminate all landlord ideological influences, so as to truly establish a worker-peasant communication network actively grasped by mass activists, poor peasant groups, and peasant association groups, making it our reliable class foundation and basic system. It then proposed: "Develop worker-peasant correspondents in large numbers, and establish communication networks directly in poor peasant groups, poor peasant leagues, and peasant association groups in the land reform struggle to transform our grassroots communication organizations." This call excited the attending representatives, who immediately launched a heated examination movement.

During the inspection, it was generally found that some people wrote articles to cater to the editorial policy, to show off, some to praise the work of their county or themselves, and some to report on the work of the county party committee or county government. The purpose of truly consciously serving the peasants was very unclear. From this, everyone examined the facts of losing their standpoint, praising landlords, and pouring cold water on the peasants, and realized that the most needed thing today is not any writing conference, but the class standpoint and mass line of expressing the power of the peasants and serving the peasants. On the other hand, they corrected the reluctance to develop worker-peasant correspondents for fear of trouble. At the same time, everyone unanimously pointed out that in the future, the development objects should not only be cadres from worker-peasant backgrounds, but should also go deep into the active elements of the worker-peasant masses, directly contact them, and create experience in developing communication networks in peasant groups.

Another gain of the conference was the awareness of the fact that landlords and special agents had infiltrated our communication network, and it was proposed to review all correspondents and clean up all bad elements. In the conference summary, Comrade Shi Jiyan proposed that Taihang newspapers and news agencies will carry out the class investigation and standpoint examination movement in accordance with the spirit of the conference; and hoped that all comrades engaged in the Party's journalistic work in the region, including editors, reporters, and correspondents, would be involved in this movement.

　　太行通讯报导会议闭幕
  　决定根据大会精神
  　贯澈查阶级查立场
    【新华社晋冀鲁豫二十五日电】太行新华日报及新华分社八月二日召开的通讯报导会议，已于二十三日闭幕，出席有各专县代表四十六人，报社及通讯社二十余人，会议期间区党委冷楚同志亲指导，人民日报袁勃同志，总分社安岗同志均远道赶来，并带来了廖承志同志、张磐石同志的鼓励和企望。
    到会代表对于一年来农村通讯报导，各种群众创造均做了汇报，其中尤以黎城发动全体人民动手写稿的经验，涉县区干部段鹏翔实行工农与知识分子互助推动成立通讯组经验，和顺从打通思想入手，领导同志亲自动笔，骨干通讯员带头，发动通讯运动经验等，表现了一年来通讯工作长足的进步。
    报纸如何联系群众，也是大会热烈讨论的一个中心问题。到会代表交流了一年来走群众路线办小报的经验，全区四十余县，共有小报一百二十六种，成为联系群众推动中心工作，表模立功传播经验的一个最有力的武器。同时也对大报提出不少宝贵意见，最主要的是希望更加加强群众观点，面向工农，实行通俗化。
    十六日传达了廖承志同志指示，号召新闻工作者在土地改革运动中掀起一个查立场运动，自觉的站到农民方面，肃清一切地主思想影响，以便真正树立一个为群众积极分子贫农小组农会小组真正掌握的工农通讯网，使之成为我们可靠的阶级基础和基本制度，继提出：“大量发展工农通讯员，要在土地改革斗争中直接在贫农小组、贫农团、农会小组中建立通讯网，改造我们通讯基层组织。”这一号召兴奋了到会代表，旋即展开热烈检查运动。
    在检查中普遍发现写稿目的有的为了迎合编辑方针，出个风头，有的为了表扬本县本人工作，有的为了给县委或县政府报导工作情况，真正自觉的为农民服务的目的是十分不明确的。从此大家又检查了丧失立场捧地主给农民泼冷水以及客里空的事实，体会到今日最需要的东西并不是什么写作大会，而是表现农民力量，为农民服务的阶级立场和群众路线，另一方面纠正了不愿意发展工农通讯员怕麻烦思想。同时大家一致指出今后发展对象除工农出身干部外，应深入到工农群众积极分子中去，直接与他们联系，创造在农民小组中发展通讯网的经验。
    大会另外一个收获是警觉到地主特务分子打入我们通讯网的事实，提出审查全部通讯员，清洗一切坏分子。在大会总结时，史纪言同志提出太行报纸及通讯社将依据大会精神，开展查阶级查立场运动；并希望全区一切从事党的新闻工作的编辑、记者、通讯员等同志，都卷入这一运动中去。
