Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 25th. Weidemayer, on the 22nd, in Chiang Kai-shek's small court's "State Affairs Meeting," put on the airs of a "master," and rebuked those servants. The small court immediately fell into chaos and staged an ugly drama of mutual accusations. According to a report by the United Press, Weidemayer, in his "instruction," demanded the requisition of "Chinese people's property in the United States" for the civil war, implying that the privileged families headed by Chiang Kai-shek should also use their property to support the anti-people's civil war to protect the interests of their families, and not always ask their godfather for money. Weidemayer's words, which disappointed the servants, were indeed a last resort. Weidemayer apparently felt that the 1.5 to 2 billion US dollars that the United States could give Chiang Kai-shek was far from enough to save Chiang Kai-shek's military and financial crisis today. The United Press claimed: It is generally believed that Weidemayer will understand that for Chiang Kai-shek's rule, "even any American aid plan will not help." Weidemayer estimated the amount of Chinese people's property in the United States to be 1.5 billion US dollars. This is of course only a very small part of the four families' deposits in the United States. The United Press also claimed: This number is two or three times less than what is often reported. "It is believed that this difference is either a misunderstanding or is being concealed." Weidemayer's "instruction" caused panic throughout Chiang Kai-shek's court, and they began to accuse each other. After he spoke these words in the morning, the National Economic Commission, directly under the Chiang Kai-shek's Executive Yuan, held a meeting in the afternoon to discuss the "property tax" issue. Senior KMT party and government officials such as Chen Lifu, Pan Gongzhan, Bai Chongxi, Wu Tiecheng, Yu Hongjun, and Wang Yunwu all participated in the meeting. Most speakers stated that "mandatory" means were needed to "choose the fat and eat it" (according to the Central News Agency), but none were willing to point out who the "fat" people were. Pan Gongzhan, a KMT Central Committee member and one of the CC clique leaders, asked Wu Tiecheng, the new vice president of the Legislative Yuan and a key figure in the Political Science faction, to specifically point out the wealthy families. Wu Tiecheng said he "didn't know" and angrily walked out of the meeting. The argument was fruitless. According to a United Press report from Nanjing on the 22nd, among the senior officials of the Chiang government who originally had high hopes for Weidemayer, a "sense of illusion" has now arisen because of this.

　　训示特权家族动用美存款打内战
  　魏德迈呵责蒋家臣仆
    蒋党顿成慌乱大演互相攻讦丑剧
    【新华社陕北二十五日电】魏德迈二十二日在蒋家小朝廷“国务会议”中摆起“主人”架子，对那批臣仆，颇有呵责，小朝廷中顿呈慌乱，并表演了一幕互相攻讦的丑剧。据合众社消息：魏在“训示”中，要求征用“中国人在美国的财产”用于内战。示意以蒋介石为首的特权家族，亦应以他们的财产支持为了保卫他们家族利益的反人民内战，不要老是一味向干爸爸要钱。魏德迈说这段使家奴扫兴的话，实非得已。魏氏显已感觉美国所能够给予蒋介石的十五亿至二十亿美元，远不能挽救今天蒋介石的军事和财政危机。合众社称：佥信魏德迈将了解，对于蒋介石统治，“甚至任何美国援助计划也不济事。”魏德迈将中国人在美国的财产的数目估计为十五亿美元。这当然只是四大家族在美存款的极小一部分，合众社亦称：这个数字比经常所报导者少两三倍，“众信这种差异，不是误解就是被隐蔽起来。”魏德迈的“训示”引起了整个蒋家朝廷的慌乱，并彼此互相攻讦。在他上午讲过这些话以后，蒋记行政院直属之全国经济委员会，下午即举行会议，讨论“财产税”问题，国民党的高级党政官员陈立夫、潘公展、白崇禧、吴铁城、俞鸿钧、王云五等都参与会议。大部分发言人都声言需要以“强制”手段“择肥而食”（据中央社），但却都不愿指出“肥”者究为何人。国民党中委ＣＣ头领之一潘公展要新任立法院副院长的政学系要角吴铁城具体指明有钱的家族，吴铁城说他“不知道”，并气愤地走出会场。争论毫无结果。据合众社南京二十二日消息：原对魏德迈抱有高度希望的蒋政府高级官中间，现已因此产生“一种幻的感觉”。
