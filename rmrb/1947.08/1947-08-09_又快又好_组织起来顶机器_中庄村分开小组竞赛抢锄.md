Organize to Surpass Machines
Zhongzhuang Village Splits into Small Groups for Competition and Hoeing

[Reported from Xingtai by our newspaper] Zhongzhuang Village in the Sixth District has a total of 129 households. Organized, they have 90 male laborers, 31 semi-laborers, 102 female laborers, and 30 semi-laborers, forming 22 mutual aid groups. Men, women, young, and old all work together to hoe the seedlings. Initially, the groups were too large, and after hoeing one plot of land, they had to run to another, which was feared to be a waste of labor. Therefore, the large groups were divided into smaller groups to hoe separately. This year, the rainfall was uneven, and the seedlings grew unevenly. Women and children were assigned to hoe in miscellaneous fields, and every morning women and children delivered meals to the fields. After being organized in this way, the Bì Tóngzhù group, for example, with six households and nine laborers, hoed eight mu of seedlings in one day. A woman in the village, Liú Dànnī, in order to compete with the men in the field, could also do the work of ten points. The masses unanimously reflect that organizing can really surpass machines and transform lazy people, making work faster. Without mutual assistance, we couldn't work this fast. The entire village has been swept up in a mutual aid hoeing surge, with male laborers hoeing 264 mu of seedlings in three days. (Chén Shìyīng)

[Reported from our newspaper] After finishing the first two rounds of hoeing for small seedlings, Běi Zhāngzhèn Village in the First District of Nèiqiū specifically summarized the hoeing achievements by mutual aid group and selected hoeing models. All the women in the village worked together, hoeing 2,696.5 mu of land in the first two rounds in four days. In addition to participating in hoeing, the women also wove forty bolts of cloth in their spare time. The groups selected 25 male and female production mutual aid models, such as Yáng Déren and Liú Qīngyún. After being broadcast and commended by the village radio station, the masses' enthusiasm for production was even higher. On the streets, the masses were all shouting, "Liú Qīngyún and Yáng Míngzǐ should have been selected as models long ago. They are so energetic and hardworking in production. If everyone learns from them, we won't have to worry about not doing a good job in production!" After the summary, they continued to replant buckwheat and autumn vegetables. All the barren land in the village, in addition to planting vegetables, was replanted completely, eliminating all the empty land. (Nèiqiū Dàzhòng Small Newspaper)

[Reported from our Jì'nán newspaper on the 6th] Xíng Jìxiū mutual aid group from Dàzhài Village in Qiū County is striving for the whole year to "save ten catties of rice and produce ten more catties of grain per person." The specific methods are: hoe the large seedlings five times, hoe the small seedlings three times, and strive to produce 3,000 more catties of grain on the 300 mu of autumn land; the 12 small manure pits of 12 households and one large manure pit of the whole group combine to apply one and a half cartloads of fertilizer per mu of wheat land, and strive to produce 66 shi (a unit of dry measure) more grain on the 660 mu of wheat land. In terms of frugality, first, do not buy dyes, which can save the entire group of 52 people 100,000 yuan for the whole year; second, use sesame leaves instead of tobacco leaves and paper cigarettes; each person wears two fewer single-layer clothes, which can save more than 10,000 yuan; all families have stopped eating wheat and switched to sorghum.
