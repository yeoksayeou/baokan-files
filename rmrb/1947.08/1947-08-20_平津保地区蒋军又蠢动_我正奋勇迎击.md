　　Chiang Kai-shek Troops Stir Up Trouble Again in the Pingjinbao Area
  　We Are Courageously Counterattacking
    Xinhua News Agency, Jin-Cha-Ji, 18th—After Chiang Kai-shek's and Fu Zuoyi's troops failed in their attempt to infiltrate the central Hebei plain last month, they have continued to concentrate even greater forces and have been stirring up trouble in our Pingjinbao triangle area since the beginning of this month. According to a public announcement by the Hebei Central Military Region Command, the enemy's 16th Army, 35th Army (two divisions), and the 95th Brigade, which turned from Wangdu towards Shunqiao in the southwest of Baoding, advanced to the vicinity of Xushui and Rongcheng and the area east of Baoding to Suncun on the 4th and 5th of this month. On the 5th, the enemy advanced eastward from Rongcheng, and occupied Xiong County at noon on the 6th, continuing to scurry towards Xinzhen. The enemy's 62nd Division from Shengfang, two regiments of the 4th Division of the 13th Army from Gu'an, and Wang Fenggang's puppet troops from Xincheng also began to stir up trouble from the north, west, and east on the 6th. On the afternoon of the same day, they successively occupied Yongqing, Liuquan (ten li south of Gu'an), Sanqingkou (more than twenty li northwest of Shengfang), Huqiying, and the area of Dongxi Gaokezhuang (about thirty li east of Xincheng). Our army and civilians in the area are now courageously counterattacking.
