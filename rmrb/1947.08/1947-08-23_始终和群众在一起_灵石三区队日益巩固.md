　　Always Stay With the Masses
  　Lingshi Third District Team Increasingly Consolidated
    [This newspaper, Taiyue, 21st dispatch] The Lingshi Third District Team, since its establishment in February this year, has been closely integrated with local farmers, combining the fight for liberation with daily life. Most of the team members are from five villages, including Suxi and Youfan. Therefore, they started with these five villages to help the farmers to achieve liberation. At that time, villages such as Majiashan, northwest of Suxi and Youfan, were enemy strongholds. The masses in the villages within ten miles of the strongholds wanted to be liberated, but no one dared to come forward. The Third District Team then first struck at the harassing enemy, and then each village team member cooperated with the work team to publicize land reform, enlighten the masses to speak out their grievances, and detain eight landlord households. Meng Jianwei, the instructor of the team, and the team members of Suxi Village, after participating in the work of the Farmers' Association, developed seven secret members for the Farmers' Association. Later, the team went to Zujie base to cooperate with the masses in the struggle. When the masses in the village held a grievance meeting, the Third District Team sent a team to harass the Xiongjun enemy, so that the enemy could not sleep at night and could not harass during the day. Meng Jianwei led the remaining team members to participate in the grievance meeting and fought the tyrant Shi Zhonglin. Wang Yougen, a liberated soldier of the team, was from Zujie Village. He told, word by word, tear by tear, how he was framed and arrested by Shi Zhonglin and his dark life in Yan's army, which aroused the masses' hatred for Shi Zhonglin. More than 50 people followed suit, and the number of people at the meeting suddenly increased from more than 200 to more than 300. In mid-April, when the enemy in Beishan changed defenses, the district team and the militias of Jiaojun, Zujie, and Ji villages worked on the mountains to protect the personnel of the command, organize the masses to transfer, transport supplies, and establish a secret intelligence network. When Yan's New Forty-Fifth Division came, they resisted a battalion of enemy troops and persisted for two days and one night. Therefore, they gained the infinite support and love of the liberated farmers, and their own troops became more consolidated.

　　始终和群众在一起
  　灵石三区队日益巩固
    【本报太岳二十一日电】灵石三区分队，于今年二月成立以来，即与当地农民密切结合，翻身打仗同时兼顾。该队队员多系苏溪、尤范等五村人。因而先从该五村着手，帮助农民翻身，当时苏溪、尤范西北的马家山等村都是敌人据点。离据点十里以内各村，群众虽想翻身，却无人敢出头。三区分队于是首先打击出扰之敌，又以各村队员分别配合工作组，宣传土地改革，启发群众诉苦，并扣押了等八户地主。分队指导员孟建威及苏溪村之队员在参加农会工作后，替农会发展了七个秘密会员，后分队又到族介基点配合群众斗争。在该村群众召开诉苦大会时，三区分队除派出一个小组袭扰熊峻敌人，使得敌人黑夜不能入睡，白天不能出扰，孟建威率领其余队员参加诉苦大会，斗争恶霸石中林。分队解放战士王有根是族介村人，他一字一泪的诉说被石中林陷害被捕及在阎军中的黑暗生活，激起了群众对石中林的仇恨，有五十多人跟着诉苦，会场上由二百余人顿时增加到三百余人。四月中旬北山敌人换防时区分队与焦峻、族介、集等村民兵，便在山岭上掩护指挥部人员，组织群众转移，搬运物资，建立秘密情报网等工作。待阎军新四十五师来后，他们抵抗了敌人一营兵力，坚持了两天一夜之久，因此获得翻身农民无限的拥护与爱戴，自己部队也就更加巩固起来。
