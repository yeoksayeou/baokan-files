　　Dagong Warehouse Notice
　　This warehouse was previously ordered to close down. Due to numerous procedures, we were unable to finalize it earlier. We hereby reiterate that all shops in various locations that have business dealings with this warehouse must bring their receipts for settlement before September 10th. Late submissions will be void, and we regret that we will not be able to handle them.
