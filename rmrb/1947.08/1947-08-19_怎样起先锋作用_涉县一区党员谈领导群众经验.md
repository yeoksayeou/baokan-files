How to Play a Vanguard Role
  Party Members in Shexian County, District One, Discuss Experiences in Leading the Masses
    Xing Chongzhi
    In order to further improve production and overcome famine and strengthen leadership, District One of Shexian County convened open meetings of party members from various villages to exchange and summarize the leadership experiences of the previous period. The speeches of the party members are reported as follows:
    Comrade Li Wensheng said: "When launching the campaign to grow more food, we first held a branch meeting and conducted detailed discussions to lead the masses to plant; however, the masses were always hesitant and uncertain, and they all put their hoes on their shoulders waiting to see what would happen. Seeing this situation, I picked up my hoe and first planted eight mu, and the masses all started planting when they saw this, and our entire village planted more than seventy mu in one day. Whatever we party members do, take the lead personally, and we can get it done." Later, I went to the fourth village to hold a mass meeting to discuss engaging in sideline production. During the discussion, Yang Mingde proposed: "We would like to engage in some small businesses, but we have no way to obtain capital. If someone could lend us 10,000 yuan, that would be great." At that time, I said that if you want to engage in sideline production, the credit cooperative can provide loans. The next day, Yang Mingde took 10,000 yuan to Shanxi to trade rapeseed, and earned 17,000 yuan in three days. I used this fact to educate the masses in each street and village. In a few days, 280,000 yuan of credit funds were raised, and two liberated peasants, Yang Jincai and Yang Linyou, were also helped to buy a donkey and an ox each."
    Comrade Shen Rui continued: "Party members taking the lead plays a great role. Our village also has this experience; in addition, in our village leadership work, we must have plans, inspections, and summaries. Before July 1st, our village arranged for frugality. At that time, it was calculated at half a jin of rice per person per day, and after July 1st, it was reduced to six liang. To see how it was being implemented, we launched an inspection at that time. From the inspection, a mass summary was carried out, and eighty-four models of all kinds in the village were elected and credited. In this way, a banner of frugality was established throughout the village. The models were praised with clappers, and the atmosphere of frugality spread throughout the village. Many households used scales to measure rice."
    Comrade Shen Rui talked about a very important leadership method. He said: "We are all leaders in the village. Other cadres can arrange the general work in the village. We just help to come up with ideas. The main point is to help lower-level cadres solve difficulties. There is a cadre in our village named Wu Bao who went to mobilize Chen Dian Shun to save a hundred days of life-saving grain. At that time, he couldn't understand, and said: 'Half a jin of noodles is enough for me to eat a day,' and he was unwilling to exchange noodles for rice. Wu Bao had no way. After I understood the situation, I went with Wu Bao to mobilize him and said: 'Half a jin of noodles is enough for you a day, is half a jin of rice enough?' Chen said: 'Half a jin of rice is more filling than half a jin of noodles.' 'Then according to you, exchanging wheat for rice is a good deal.' Chen said: 'I want to go, but I don't have livestock.' Wu Bao said: 'I will go tomorrow and bring you along.' Chen was happy at the time, and the next day he exchanged four dou of wheat for rice, adding up to six dou with the original two dou of rice, so he saved life-saving grain. In this way, Dian Shun's problem was solved, and Wu Bao's confidence was also increased.
    Comrade Yang Xian then went on to say: "In addition to what the comrades have said above, I will add two points, that is, using activists. I often grasp a few activists. Every work is discussed with them first. After their thinking is clear, they go to the masses to carry out activities. For example, when collecting shares for transportation, I first straightened out Yang Fugui, and then straightened out five activists. At the mass meeting in the whole street, these five people played a backbone role, collecting more than 30,000 yuan in total. This method satisfies the masses and saves effort in work. Another point is to use typical examples to promote the general. When accumulating a hundred days of life-saving grain, we first conducted ideological discussions and mobilization throughout the village. I went deep into my group and accumulated six shi and six dou of fine grain and four shi of millet, and used this fact to promote the accumulation of four problems."
    Comrades Li Shuyun, Liu Jingyi and others also talked about their experiences. In the end, everyone jointly felt one point of experience, that is, going deep into the poor peasants to lead, and everything will succeed. At the same time, everyone knows that this is a fundamental problem. After the discussion, everyone introduced and learned a lot of experience from each other, and their confidence was greatly increased.

　　怎样起先锋作用
  　涉县一区党员谈领导群众经验
    邢崇智
    为了把生产渡荒提高一步，加强领导，涉县一区曾召开各村公开党员会议，交流总结前一段的领导经验，兹将各党员的发言报导于后：
    李文生同志说：“在发动干种地时，首先开了支部会议，进行了细密的讨论，领导群众种；但是群众总是疑惑不定，都把拿来扛到门上等着看眼色。我看到这种情况，扛起锄首先种了八亩，群众一看都种开了，俺全闾一天种七十多亩。啥事咱们党员亲自动手带头，就能做起来。”以后我又到四闾开群众会，讨论搞副业。在讨论当中，杨明德提出：“咱倒想搞些小生意，可是没有地方弄本钱，谁要借给咱一万元就行。”那时我便说，你想搞副业，信用部可以借款。第二天杨明德拿上一万元到山西买卖菜籽，来回三天赚了一万七千元。我又拿这个事实教育各街各闾群众，不几天，集起信用款二十八万元，还扶助杨金才、杨林有二个翻身农民买了驴牛各一头。”
    申瑞同志接着说：“党员带头起很大作用，咱村也有这个经验；另外咱们在村领导工作，要有计划有检查有总结才行。俺村在七一前布置好了节约，当时一天一人以半斤米计算，到七一后降成了六两。为了看看执行如何，当时就发动了检查。从检查中进行了群众性的总结，选举了八十四个全村各色各样的模范，并都记了功。这样一来，树立了全村的节约旗帜。对各模范又用快板表扬，节约的风气普遍到全村，有不少户用秤下米。”
    申瑞同志谈了一点很重要的领导方法。他说：“咱们在村上都是领导人，村里一般工作，其他干部都能安排了，咱帮助出主意就行，主要一点是帮助下层干部解决困难。俺村有一个干部叫五保，去动员陈殿顺保存百天救命粮，当时他思想弄不通，说：“我一天半斤面就够吃”，不愿用面换米。五保没办法。我了解了情况后，和五保一块去动员说：“你一天半斤面够用了，半斤米够不够？”陈说：“半斤米可比半斤面吃出来了。”“那照你这样说，麦子换米可是合帐”。陈说：“我想去，可是没有牲口。”五保说：“我明天也去，给你捎上。”陈当时高兴，第二天换了四斗麦子的米，连原有二斗米共合六斗，这样他才存起了救命粮。这样殿顺的问题解决了，也提高了五保的信心。
    杨贤同志又紧接着说：“除以上各同志谈的外，我再补充两点，就是运用积极分子。我经常掌握几个积极分子，每样工作都先经过他们讨论，思想通了后，到群众中活动，如集股运输时，首先弄通杨福贵，以后又弄通五个积极分子。到全街群众会上，这五个人起了骨干作用，共集了三万多元，这办法群众又满意工作又省劲。再一个就是用典型推动一般，在积百天救命粮时，先在全村进行了思想讨论动员，我深入我组积起六石六斗细粮，四石谷子，用这个事实推动了四个问题积起来了。
    继由李树云、刘景义等同志都谈了自己的经验，最后大家共同感到了一点经验，就是深入贫农去领导，啥事也成功，同时都知道这是个根本问题。经过座谈，大家都互相介绍互相学习了很多经验，信心倍增。
