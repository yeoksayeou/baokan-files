[Reported by this newspaper] Shexian County Head Qin, after the rain at the end of last month, went to Liu Jiazhuang, Jin Jia Hui, Liao Cheng and other places in the Second District to inspect uncultivated land. After discovering it, he immediately notified the landowners to plant within a limited time. If they did not plant, he would mobilize mutual aid to pick up land and plant wasteland. In the Suobao area, it was proposed that all open spaces and building foundations be planted. Under this promotion, not only was no land left uncultivated in the Second District, but even small barren slopes, building foundations, and open spaces were planted. When he came to Shimenji, he found that there was a labor shortage, so he mobilized women to go to the fields to pull seedlings. The next day, the women all went to the fields. County Head Qin, elementary school teachers, and workers all went to the fields and planted five minutes of vegetables. During the inspection, County Head Qin also hoed corn for half a day for old man Yang Fugui (sixty years old). The villagers were all talking about it at the meal market: "The world is different from before. The county head is also hoeing the ground for the masses! In the old society, us suffering people would never have seen the county head in our lives!" (Quick Weeding Report)

　　涉县秦县长
  　检查白地帮助锄苗
    【本报讯】涉县秦县长在上月底雨后，到二区刘家庄、靳家会、辽城等地检查荒地，发现后，即通知地户限期种上，不种上即发动互助拾地种荒。在索堡一带，提出将所有场地房基地都种上。在这样推动下，二区不但没留一块白地，连小块荒坡房基地场地都种上。来到石门基点发现劳力困难，即发动妇女上地拔苗，第二天妇女们都上地，秦县长及小学教员工作员一齐到地，种了五分菜。秦县长在检查中又给杨富贵老汉（六十岁）翻了半日玉茭，全村群众都在饭市上谈说着：“世道就是和从前不一样了，当县长还给群众锄地哩！要是旧社会咱这些受苦人一辈子也见不了县长面！”（快锄苗报）
