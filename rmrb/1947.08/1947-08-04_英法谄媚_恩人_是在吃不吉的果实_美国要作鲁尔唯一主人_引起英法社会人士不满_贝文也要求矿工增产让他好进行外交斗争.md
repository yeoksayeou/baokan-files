Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, August 31st: TASS Moscow dispatch: Pravda political commentator Leontev commented: The new unilateral actions of the United States on the German issue have crowded out all the flattering articles in the British and French newspapers that flattered the United States as a boundless "benefactor." According to the American plan to restore Ruhr production, the Americans want to be the sole masters of this German industrial center, while retaining the "property rights" of those German industrial giants who once funded Hitler. This direct and blatant attempt to turn western Germany into a private warehouse for American monopolists has caused so much dissatisfaction and indignation among democratic figures in Britain and France that even Bevin felt compelled to say a few words at the local miners' conference to rebuke the European "benefactor" across the Atlantic, and French Ambassador to Washington Bonnet also had to protest to the US government. However, the "resistance" of the British and French political leaders proved to be short-lived. Within two or three days, Britain and France successively succumbed. It is worth pointing out that the United States presented Britain and France with what amounted to an ultimatum: either agree to the American plan for Germany, or give up hope of obtaining American financial aid. This is the much-publicized "Marshall Plan." The American plan to increase Germany's industrial level threatens France with the double danger of losing access to coal from the Ruhr and the resurgence of German military power. France is now reaping the bitter fruits of its ominous foreign policy. The French government now remembers that the fate of Germany, especially the issue of German production, should be decided by the four foreign ministers. The London Times also suddenly remembered the upcoming November meeting of the four foreign ministers of the Soviet Union, Britain, France, and the United States, saying that caution should be exercised to ensure the success of the November meeting. Leontev concluded: Have the divisive actions carried out by the Western powers not gone too far!

Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, August 30th: London dispatch: Just as the United States is making every effort to unilaterally control Ruhr coal production, British Foreign Secretary Bevin delivered a speech at the Durham Miners' Union banquet on the 26th, revealing his dissatisfaction with the United States and once again calling on coal miners to increase production. Bevin said: I am working day and night, studying the dollar problem, and fighting it. He said: As a government official, I ask you and your partners to come forward to help overcome this short period in order to defeat those insidious and malicious people.

Let us increase coal production to catch up with 1938 (Note: British coal production reached 200 million tons that year), give me this weapon!

    英法谄媚“恩人”是在吃不吉的果实
    美国要作鲁尔唯一主人
    引起英法社会人士不满
    贝文也要求矿工增产让他好进行外交斗争
    【新华社陕北三十一日电】塔斯社莫斯科讯：真理报政治观察家里昂吉也夫评称：美国在对德问题上新的片面行动，已把英、法报纸上一切谄媚美国称之为无边的“恩人”的拍马屁文章都挤掉了。根据美国恢复鲁尔生产的计划美国人想做这个德国工业中心独一无二的主人，同时保留了那些过去曾资助过希特勒的德国工业巨子的“财产权”。这种直接的和明目张胆的想把德国西部变成美国独占者私有仓库的企图，在英、法民主社会人士中所引起的不满和愤慨是如此之大，以致甚至贝文也认为必须在地方矿工大会上讲几句责备那大西洋彼岸的欧洲的“恩人”的话，法国驻华盛顿大使庞纳也要向美政府提出抗议：可是英、法政治首脑们的“抵抗”证明是昙花一现的。在二三天之内，英国、法国就相继屈服了。值得指出的是美国向英、法所提出的实质上等于最后通谍——或者同意美国对德的计划，或则放弃取得美国财政援助的希望。这就是那大肆鼓吹的“马歇尔计划。”美国增加德国工业水平的计划威胁了法国使其有丧失向鲁尔取得煤以及德国军事力量复兴的两重危险，法国现在是在食取其不吉的外交政策之后果了。法国政府这才记起了德国的命运，特别是德国生产的问题，应由四外长来决定。伦敦泰晤士报也突然记起了未来的十一月间苏、英、法、美四国外长会议，说应该小心谨慎以使十一月会议能够成功。里昂吉也夫最后称：西方列强所进行的分裂行动难道还没有太过分吗！
    【新华社陕北三十日电】伦敦讯：正值美国亟力图谋单独控制鲁尔煤产之际，英外相贝文二十六日在都尔翰矿工会宴上发表演说：透露了对美国的不满情绪，再次呼吁煤矿工人加产，贝文称：我正在日以继夜地工作，研究美元问题，并与之斗争。他说：作为政府官员之一，我要求你们及你们的伙伴出而帮助克服这一短暂的时期，以便击败那些阴险恶毒的人。
    让我们增加煤产量赶上一九三八年（按：该年英煤产达两万吨），给我这种武器吧！
