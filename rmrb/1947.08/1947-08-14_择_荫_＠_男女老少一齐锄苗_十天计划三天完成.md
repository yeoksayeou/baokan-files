  　Men, Women, Young, and Old Hoe Seedlings Together
  　Ten-Day Plan Completed in Three Days
    [Reported by this newspaper] Ze Yin @ in the Third District of She County has 947 mu of land. There are 64 fully able-bodied men, 59 semi-able-bodied men, 81 fully able-bodied women, and 43 semi-able-bodied women in the whole village. If only the fully able-bodied men were to hoe, it would take ten days. Later, everyone discussed that letting older children and women hoe together could complete it faster. Therefore, Guo Yinshun, the chairman of the Women's Federation, and Ma Jinyu first mobilized three liberated women to hoe seedlings. That night, they broadcasted it on the radio platform. The next day, 36 women voluntarily went to the fields to hoe seedlings. First-class women hoeing land earned 2.5 fen, equivalent to 7 fen of work. Children also wanted to go to the fields to hoe. At this time, the leadership first gave the children half the wage, which made the children even more active, getting up very early in the morning and urging everyone to go to the fields. In this way, men, women, young, and old worked together, completing the ten-day plan in three days. After completion, the fully able-bodied men have now gone out to sell their labor.

  　男女老少一齐锄苗
  　十天计划三天完成
    【本报讯】涉县三区择荫＠，全村有九百四十七亩地，男全劳力六十四个，半劳力五十九个，女全劳力八十一个，半劳力四十三个，若只男全劳力锄，计划得十天，以后大家讨论说：让大一些的儿童与妇女一齐锄，可以快些完成。于是妇联主席郭印顺、马金鱼先动员翻身妇女三个去锄苗，到黑夜在广播台上广播出去，第二天就有三十六个妇女自动上地锄苗，头等妇女锄地二分五厘顶七分工。儿童也要上地锄，这时领导上先给儿童工资一半，这样儿童更积极起来，早上起的很早，催大家上地。这样男女老少齐动手，三天完成了十天计划。完成后，现男全劳力已出去卖工。（抢锄抢种报）
