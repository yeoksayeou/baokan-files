　　Chiang's Troops Invade North of Daqing River Again
  　Attacking Empty Air and Taking Losses Everywhere
    [Xinhua News Agency, Jin察冀, 20th Dispatch] (Delayed) Since August 6th, Chiang's troops in the northern section of the Ping-Han Railway have invaded the Ping-Jin-Bao triangular area north of the Daqing River in central Hebei. They include the entire 16th Army of Chiang's troops (minus one regiment), two regiments of the 43rd Division of the 94th Army, and more than 30,000 puppet troops from seven counties including Xincheng, Gu'an, and Yongqing. On the 6th, they occupied our Xiong County, and on the 7th, they occupied our county towns of Yongqing, Xinzhen, and Ba County, as well as villages and towns such as Niutuo and Qugou (both south of Gu'an), and strictly blockaded the Daqing River and the main villages north of it, attempting to encircle and annihilate our troops between the Beining Railway and the Daqing River. After a week of fighting, our troops have flexibly moved to the enemy's flanks, causing the enemy's encirclement to miss its target everywhere. Our local militia also launched sparrow warfare and landmine warfare, making Chiang's troops exhausted and extremely embarrassed. The enemy who attacked from Xinzhen and Rongcheng alone suffered more than 50 casualties inflicted by us. After the enemy's attempt to encircle and annihilate our troops failed, they are now carrying out "zonal suppression" in units of eight regiments.

　　蒋军再犯大清河北
  　处处挨打扑空
    【新华社晋察冀二十日电】（迟到）平汉北段蒋军自六日起，向冀中大清河以北平津保三角地区进犯。计有蒋军十六军全部（缺一个团）九十四军第四十三师之两个团及新城、固安、永清等七县伪军共三万余人。六日占我雄县，七日占我永清、新镇、霸县等县城，及牛驼、渠沟（均在固安以南）等村镇，并严密封锁大清河及其以北各主要村庄，企图围歼我军于北宁路与大清河之间。经一周战斗，我军已机动灵活转入敌之侧翼，使敌之合围处处扑空。我当地民兵亦展开麻雀战地雷战，蒋军疲备不堪，异常狼狈，仅新镇、容城出犯之敌，即被我毙伤五十余名，敌于围歼我军之企图失败后，现正以八个团为单位，进行“分区清剿”。
