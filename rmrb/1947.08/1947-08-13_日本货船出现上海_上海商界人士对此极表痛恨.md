Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 11th: Shanghai News: As a prelude to Japan's official resumption of trade with the Far East this autumn, the largest Japanese cargo ship since the war appeared in Shanghai on the 8th. The ship was en route from Shanghai to Xiamen, Hong Kong, and Singapore, carrying a full load of goods, including 20,000 bales of cotton yarn and a large amount of cloth, totaling approximately 5,000 tons. This matter has drawn serious attention from the Shanghai business community, which believes this is a provocative indication of Japan's desire to regain the Chinese and Southeast Asian markets. Meanwhile, a spokesperson for Chiang's Economic Ministry stated that preliminary plans are being drafted to transport raw materials such as tung oil, salt, and bristles to Japan. Reuters reporters have also learned from reliable sources that the Chiang government will ship 34,000 tons of goods from Qingdao to Japan within this month for the purpose of developing Japan's chemical industry. Chiang Kai-shek's traitorous government, disregarding the fierce opposition of the Chinese people, and in order to cater to the intentions of its American masters and accommodate Japanese interests, passed the "Open Trade with Japan" measure at the end of last month. One can glean from this the dark prospects it will bring to Chinese industry and commerce. The Shanghai business community feels great concern about this and hates Chiang Kai-shek's act of selling out national interests.

Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 10th: Tokyo Dispatch: The trend of inflation in Japan is becoming increasingly serious. The number of banknotes issued by the Bank of Japan in July was greater than in any of the past four months. As of the end of July, the total number of Japanese banknotes issued was 143,745,500,000 yen, with July alone accounting for 7,400,000,000 yen. According to Osaka city authorities, retail prices at the end of July were 148 times higher than in the same period in 1937; among them, food prices rose 193 times, and clothing prices rose the highest, up to 211 times. According to reliable sources, Japanese financial cliques intend to promote Japan's inflation in order to seek compensation for war losses from the intensified exploitation of the blood and sweat of the vast Japanese people.

　　日本货船出现上海
  　上海商界人士对此极表痛恨
    【新华社陕北十一日电】上海消息：作为今秋日本正式恢复对远东贸易之先声，日本战后最大一艘货船已于八日出现于上海。该船系经上海驶往厦门、香港及新加坡者，上面载满货物、内包括棉纱二万包及大量布匹，共约五千吨。此事已引起上海商界人士之严重注意，认为此系日本欲重获中国及东南亚市场之挑战性表示，同时据蒋记经济部发言人表示，现正草拟初步计划，将桐油、盐、猪鬃等原料运往日本。路透社记者更自可靠方面获悉，蒋政府将于本月内由青岛运三万四千吨运赴日充发展日本化学工业之用。蒋介石卖国政府于上月底不顾中国人民激烈反对，为奉承美国主子意旨适应日本利益通过之“开放对日贸易”一举，所将带给中国工商业之又一黑暗远景，当可由此窥见。上海商界人士为此感到极大忧虑，并痛恨蒋介石之出卖国家利益行为。
    【新华社陕北十日电】东京讯：日本通货膨胀趋势日益严重，日本银行七月份发行之钞票较过去四个月中任何一月为多，迄七月底止，日本钞票发行数，共计一千四百三十七亿四千五百万日元，七月份就占七十四亿日元。据大阪市当局宣称：七月底零售物价较一九三七年同期涨一百四十八倍；其中食物价格涨一百九十三倍，衣料品价格最高涨至二百十一倍。据确息，日本财阀有意促进日本之通货膨胀，以便从加强剥削日本广大人民的血汗中，争得战争损失之补偿。
