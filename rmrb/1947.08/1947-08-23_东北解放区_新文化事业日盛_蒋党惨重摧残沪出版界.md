Xinhua News Agency, Northeast, 19th: New cultural and publishing undertakings in the Northeast Liberated Areas are thriving. In Harbin, Qiqihar, Jiamusi, Mudanjiang, Andong, Tonghua, and other places, there are relatively large publishing houses and bookstores. The Northeast Bookstore in Harbin has published 216 kinds of various famous works in recent years, totaling approximately 1,254,500 copies. Among political books, Chairman Mao's four major works and Chen Boda's "The Four Big Families of China" are the most popular among readers. With the enrollment of a large number of emancipated peasant children, the bookstore has printed 56 kinds of primary and secondary school textbooks, totaling 1,315,000 copies. Among them, the "Rural Political Reader" is the most popular, almost one per person among young people in the Northeast Liberated Areas. Li Zhihua's recent one-act play "Anti-Ba Struggle," which was commended by the Northeast Bureau of the Chinese Communist Party, has also been published and is selling very well. In addition to the Northeast Daily, which has a daily circulation of 40,000 copies, there are also more than ten medium-sized daily newspapers such as the Liaodong, West Manchuria, Jilin, Mudanjiang, and Jicha Rehe Liaoning Mass Daily, and the Baichengzi Victory News, with an average circulation of more than 10,000 copies. There are also many privately-run newspapers in Harbin, Qiqihar and other cities. In addition, larger counties and special districts have small mass newspapers. Among magazines, the comprehensive "Knowledge" and "Northeast Literature and Art" and "Northeast Telegraph" have the largest circulation, with exquisite printing and rich content. Works by famous writers and celebrities are often published on them. Movie theaters are popular in various cities, with more than ten in Harbin alone. The "Democratic Northeast" newsreel newly produced by the Northeast Film Studio has released three episodes. In recent years, the patriotic self-defense war, mass movements, industrial and mining construction, and heroic deeds of labor in the Northeast Liberated Area have all appeared on the screen. The "Great Summer Offensive" film of the Democratic Allied Army has also been released in Harbin, and the audience is very enthusiastic, with every show sold out.

Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 20th: Shanghai dispatch: Since Chiang Kai-shek issued the counter-revolutionary "general mobilization," the remaining liberal publications have all been forced to cease publication. The entire publishing industry is also suffering severe blows under the control of paper and soaring prices. The "Digest" semi-monthly, which has been published for more than ten years, has been changed to a monthly. The "United Books and Newspapers," which has been published for three years, has been changed from a bi-weekly to a monthly. The so-called "humorous" "West Wind" magazine has also been forced to move its publishing center to Chongqing. Countless other publications with weaker foundations have been reduced in size or closed down. On the 2nd of last month, Shu Zongqiao, the publisher of "United Books and Newspapers," pointed out the plight of the Shanghai publishing industry: "Even if the pricing of the publishing industry is increased again, it is still impossible to maintain its minimum capital. If the current economic situation continues, I am afraid that the publications that rely on distribution will all stop publishing in two or three months, and bookstores will also close down one after another."

    【新华社东北十九日电】东北解放区新文化出版事业日益发达，哈尔滨、齐齐哈尔、佳木斯、牡丹江、安东、通化各地，均有规模颇大之出版社和书店。哈市东北书店，年来出版之各种名著即达二百十六种，约一百二十五万四千五百册，政治书籍中以毛主席四大名著及陈伯达之“中国四大家族”等书最受读者欢迎，随着广大翻身农民子弟之入学，该店已印中小学课本五十六种，一百三十一万五千册，其中农村政治读本一书，销路最广，几乎是东北解放区青年人手一。曾获中共东北局表扬的李之华近作“反把斗争”独幕剧单行本也已出版，销路极广。报纸除东北日报日出四万份外，尚有辽东、西满、吉林、牡丹江、冀察热辽之群众日报，白城子之胜利报等十余中型日报，销路平均皆在万份以上。哈市及齐齐哈尔等市并有私人经营之报纸多种。另外较大县份及专区则有小型群众报。杂志以综合性之“知识”及“东北文艺”、“东北电报”销路最大，印刷精美，内容丰富，著名作家及名流学者之作品多发表其上。电影院普及各城市，哈市一地即有十余家。东北电影制片厂新制之“民主东北”新闻记录片已出三辑，年来东北解放区之爱国自卫战争，群众运动，工矿建设及劳英事迹一一出现于银幕之上，民主联军伟大的夏季攻势一片亦已在哈市开映，观众极为踊跃，场场客满。
    【新华社陕北二十日电】上海讯：自蒋介石颁布反革命“总动员”后，残存的自由主义刊物已全部被迫停刊，整个出版事业亦在统制纸张及物价飞涨压迫下，遭受惨打击。出版十年以上的“文摘”旬刊，已改为月刊；出版三年的联合书报由双周刊改为月刊。所谓“幽默”的西风杂志亦被迫将出版中心移往重庆。其他基础较薄弱的刊物缩小及停办者不可胜数。上月二日联合书报发行人舒宗侨指出沪市出版界厄称：“出版界之定价虽再提高，然亦无法保持其最低资本。照目前经济情形继续下去，恐两三个月后靠发行维持之刊物将全部停刊，书店亦将纷纷关闭。”
