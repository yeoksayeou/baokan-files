　　About "Opinions on a Slogan"
    Han Fu
    Editor's Note: "Everybody's Talk" is a garden for readers, and different opinions are naturally welcome. Comrade Han Fu's argument about the role of slogans in actual movements and the degree of mass acceptance is very good. However, regarding the slogan itself, the fact that it has caused misunderstanding is a fact. How the general public understands this sentence should still be investigated. Slogans and catchphrases are guidelines for action, and they should be clear and unambiguous. We should never oppose the use of idioms, but we must pay attention to not being constrained and hampered by old forms.
    In the "Opinions on a Slogan" in the "Everybody's Talk" column on July 10th, criticism was raised against "When the poor become rich, one wealth covers a hundred uglinesses." As far as I know, this slogan was proposed by the masses after the realization of "land to the tiller." During the mass production movement, the masses had a fear of wealth. For example, the children of Gaojiang Village said: "It's enough to eat and drink today! We dare not make a big fortune; who knows what will happen if we get rich?" At that time, some people grumbled, saying: "Don't we poor people have ugliness after we have it?" So someone said: "When the poor become rich, one wealth covers a hundred uglinesses." This means: the poor should work hard in production after they have turned over, and getting rich is not a shameful thing; it is most glorious for the poor to get rich in the mass production movement. At that time, the masses' proposal was definitely not, as Comrade Hongfei suggested, that they would become rich immediately after turning over. The masses said: "If you want to live well, get up early;" "If you want to get rich, spin and weave;" "Turn over to beat the landlords, only production can lead to wealth." The original meaning of this slogan is: after mass production, the poor can truly become rich, "the poor can become rich." Therefore, at that time, the masses' proposal was definitely not that it is a shameful thing for the poor to be rich, or that wealth covers up the ugliness of the poor! Nor was it saying that the wealth of landlords is not a shameful thing. Therefore, I feel that: the masses' understanding is all like this, but you insist on putting forward what you said. Then you cannot guide the actions of the masses, and the masses will be very slow to accept it. When the masses' intention is like this, "as if it is low-level," it can represent the actions of the vast majority of the masses.
    Therefore, it can be concluded that: when the masses' intention can only accept relatively crude things, I will gradually improve his understanding and awareness with crude things. We should not drill into it from the other side. Even if you propose something very high and creative, the masses (especially farmers) will ignore you. In short, this slogan has played a big role in mass production, so I would like to make an explanation for everyone to study.

### 关于“对一条标语的意见”

　　关于“对一条标语的意见”
    汉夫
    编者按：大家谈是读者的园地，有不同的意见，自然欢迎尽量提出。汉夫同志就标语对实际运动的作用及群众接受的程度立论，是很好的。但就标语本身说，已引起误会是事实，一般群众究如何了解这句话，还应调查。标语口号既是行动的指针，就应作到明确无误，我们决不应反对利用熟语，但一定要注意不受旧形式的拘束和妨害。
    七月十号在大家谈栏中“对一条标语的意见”对“穷人变成有，一富遮百丑”提出批评。据我所知，这条标语是实现耕者有其田后群众提的。群众在大生产运动中，有怕富思想。如郜匠村群孩说：“今天够吃够喝就行了！可不敢发那大财；发了财还不定怎样呢？”当时有些人圪噪的说：“咱们穷人有了丑不丑？”于是就有人说：“穷人变成有，一富遮百丑”。这意思说：穷人翻身后好好闹生产，发财后并不是一件丢丑的事；穷人在大生产运动中发财致富是最光荣的。当时群众的提法，决不是如鸿飞同志所提的是翻身后就翻富了，群众说：“想要过好把明起早；”“想要发富，纺花织布”，“翻身打地主，生产才致富，”这条标语原意就是：经过大生产后，穷人真正才能发财致富的，“穷人才能变成有”。因此在当时群众的提法，是决不是穷人富了是丑事，富了就把穷人的丑遮着了！也决不是说地主的富不是丑事。因此，我觉得：群众的认识都是这样，你偏提出你所说言语。那就不能引导群众的行动，群众接受就很慢。当群众意议是这样“好象是低级的”但却能代表广大群众行动。
    因此可以得出结论：当群众意议只能接受较粗糙的东西时，我就以粗糙东西逐渐提高他的认识和觉悟程度，我们不应对它从另一面钻，钻来钻去，纵使你提的很高，你有创造，但群众（尤其是农民）不理会你的。总之这标语在群众生产中起了很大作用，故特提出说明，供大家研究。
