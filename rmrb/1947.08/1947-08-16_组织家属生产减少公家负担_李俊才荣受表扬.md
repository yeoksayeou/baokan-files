　　Organizing Family Production to Reduce Public Burden
  　Li Juncai Receives Praise
    [Reported by this newspaper] Li Juncai, a material custodian at the No. 2 Warehouse of the First Management Office of the Industry and Mining Bureau, has a wife, a twelve-year-old daughter, and a seven-year-old son, totaling four family members. After the production and thrift campaign was launched, he actively responded and mobilized his family to engage in production, not relying on the government to solve their living difficulties. He has already achieved results: In addition to his work duties, he participates in the mutual aid group stationed in the village, laboring alongside the masses, planting three mu of wheat, which yielded one hundred and twenty-six jin this summer. He also planted more than forty pumpkin vines, two *fenzi* of beans and lentils, and autumn vegetables such as buckwheat and vegetable roots. His wife, in addition to housework, also participates in the women's spinning mutual aid group stationed in the village, averaging four *liang* of spun cotton per day. She also takes time to gather wild vegetables, and has already woven more than seven *zhang* of homespun cloth, enough for the whole family of four to wear. The gathered wild vegetables are eaten and also sun-dried and stored as a reserve for lean times – one hundred and twenty jin. She also bought sixty jin of bran and stir-fried flour, and their meals consist mainly of millet mixed with wild vegetables and other substitute foods. The two children attend school in the morning and gather firewood or wild vegetables in the afternoon. The whole family of four is immersed in the wave of production and thrift. The First Management Office recently issued a circular commending him, pointing out that his great production achievements are an action that responds to the call of the higher authorities. Finally, it called on all employees to learn from Comrade Li Juncai's spirit of organizing family production, overcoming difficulties, and reducing the public burden. (Han Guojun)
