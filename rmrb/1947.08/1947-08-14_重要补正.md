　　Important Correction

　　Xinhua News Agency, dated the 9th, carried a dispatch from northern Shaanxi. In the commentary by a military observer on the General Headquarters of the People's Liberation Army's one-year war achievements report, the sentence "The Liberation Army captured 202 Chiang Kai-shek army general-level officers" should be corrected to "The Liberation Army annihilated 46 entire brigades (including nine entire divisions) of the Chiang Kai-shek army, capturing or killing 202 Chiang Kai-shek army general-level officers." Furthermore, after "Even if only half of the captured are calculated as replacements, comparing gains and losses in one year," it should read "still increased by approximately 200,000 men," followed by "together with the local army and guerrillas in the liberated areas," all to be corrected accordingly.

　　重要补正
    新华社九日所发陕北电，某军事观察家评人民解放军总部一年战绩公报之谈话中，“解放军俘虏蒋军将级军官二百零二名”一句，应补正为“解放军歼灭蒋军四十六个整旅（包括九个整师），俘毙蒋军将级军官二百零二名”。又“即仅以俘虏半数作为补充计算，一年得失相较”之后，应为“仍增加约二十万人”，下接“加以解放区地方军游击队”，一并更正。
