　　South Song Branch Calls on Party Members
  　Each Lead a Mutual Aid Team
    [This Newspaper Reported] In South Song, the fifth district of Changzhi, last November, there were concerns that the autumn harvest wouldn't be completed, so both men and women went to the fields, working wherever there was land. Over 100 people ate collectively, but seven couldn't find their wage rice. This spring, when mutual aid was called for, some were afraid of being isolated, some were afraid of falling behind, and some were afraid of being called unawakened turn-over peasants, so they responded to Chairman Mao's call to engage in mutual aid. In addition, due to the problems left over from last year, the masses had many opinions they dared not voice. During this major rectification of mutual aid teams, the branch first convened a meeting of Party members, calling on each Party member to lead a mutual aid team well. Song Xiaobu first mobilized everyone in the mutual aid team, saying, "Say whatever you have to say, don't be afraid of my retaliation." He especially supported the team leaders, saying he was very happy to be criticized this time. The team leader said, "When you're a cadre, when you're told to go to the fields, you only get up when it's mealtime. You don't participate in the team, and you do sideline businesses for yourself. When we don't farm your land, you ask the team to examine why we don't farm your land. As the civil affairs director, it's okay for you not to go to the fields, but the team members call you 'master.' I'm not convinced by you as a team leader. Am I right?" Song Xiaobu accepted his mistakes at the meeting, admitting that he was wrong. After this self-criticism, he was praised by the meeting. In order to make the mutual aid teams even better, all forty teams in the village, whether cadres or team members, criticized and examined each other, resolving outstanding issues. Over two days, more than 100 issues were resolved. The village head and political director called on everyone to choose mutual aid if they could, and to voluntarily recombine if they couldn't. Previously, there were forty teams, but for the convenience of doing sideline businesses, they voluntarily combined into twenty-nine teams, and the number of participants also expanded. The eleven collapsed teams with thirty-seven people were also recombined into mutual aid teams. After the rectification, the masses said, "This is really good." The cadres also felt very relieved, and Party member Song Xiaobu's prestige among the masses and Party members was also enhanced. (Changzhi Rectification Mutual Aid Report)

　　南宋支部号召党员
  　每人带好一个互助组
    【本报讯】长治五区南宋，去年十一月间秋地怕完不成，所以男女都去地，见地就进，一百余人集体吃饭，有七人找不见工资米。今春号召互助，有的怕孤立，有的怕落后，还有的怕说翻身不觉悟，为响应毛主席的号召互助起来的，再加上去年存在下遗留问题，群众有不少意见不敢提。在这次大整顿互助组时，首先支部召开党员会，号召每个党员作好一个互助组。宋小补先在互助组动员了大家一番，说：“有什么就提什么，不要怕我报复。”特别给小组长撑腰，说这次与我提意见我很高兴。组长说：“你当干部，叫你去地，每天你饭时才要起，组你不参加，做副业给你自己做。没给你作了地，你叫组内检讨为什么不给你作地，你当民事主任，你不去地行呀，叫你解决问题叫不动，组员叫你是老爷。我当组长是不服气你，你说对不对？”宋小补在大会上接受了自己错误，承认就是不对。这样检讨后，受到大会表扬，为了把互助组搞的更好，全村四十个小组，不论干部、组员，互相提意见检讨，解决遗留问题。经两天的时间，解决问题百余件。村长、政治主任号召：能互助选互助、不能互助重新自愿结合。以前四十组，为了作副业更便利，自愿结合了廿九组，参加人数也扩大了，并把垮了的十一个组三十七人也重新结合了互助组。经过整顿后，群众说：“这才真正好。”干部也觉得很痛快，党员宋小补的威信在群众党员中，也提高了一步。（长治整顿互助报）
