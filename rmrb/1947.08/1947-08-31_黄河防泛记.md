    Record of Yellow River Flood Prevention
    Jun Qian
    [This newspaper's Jilu豫 (冀鲁豫) branch reported on the 29th] 社记者君谦报导黄河防泛称: Before the great flood arrived, along the six hundred plus *li* long Yellow River northern bank's levee, a flood prevention house or dugout was built every two hundred meters. Each flood prevention house had two to ten people, constantly watching the water situation. When the great flood came, the masses within fifteen *li* of the levee actively surged onto the dam with tools and materials for emergency repairs and levee protection. The Puyang County Flood Prevention Headquarters paid special attention to this levee protection and flood prevention work. In addition to regular supervision and inspection, they organized inspection teams and held three major inspections in stages. The first inspection checked all preparations for flood prevention, and the Second District won the gold-lettered plaque as a result of this inspection. To understand the situation of the Puyang County masses protecting the levee and preventing floods, the reporter accompanied the plaque-deliverying masses along the dam to the Second District Flood Prevention Headquarters in Xinzhuangji on the morning of the 18th for an inspection. Upon reaching the levee, we saw the turbid Yellow River water surging like ten thousand horses galloping, roaring and screeching, its sound heard for several *li*. Villages on the riverbed, such as Qian Liqiao and Zhong Liqiao, had been completely submerged in the water. Although the great flood had stopped rising at 8:00 AM that day, each flood prevention house still had ten flood prevention masses actively working. Some were carrying soil from outside the back of the levee to fill in areas eroded by rainwater, some were drying the wet hay for emergency use, or drying wet soil in preparation for filling sacks for emergency use. Each flood prevention house was equipped with eighteen kinds of flood prevention and emergency repair materials, such as straw bags. In addition, each sub-district had a large bell and four iron pieces hanging high, and each district had a small boat and more than 100,000 *jin* of sorghum stalks prepared. On the wall of each flood prevention house were painted cartoons of levee protection and flood prevention, as well as the slogan "Resolutely fight against Chiang's water army." The flood prevention houses were built solidly and neatly, and various equipment was displayed in an orderly manner inside and outside the house. If an emergency occurred at night and something was needed for rescue, the required items could be reached without lights and without confusion. Blackboards were also well equipped on each section of the Yellow River levee. The blackboard in Dongsangzhuang in the Second District wrote about the news that a leak was found in Dawangzhuang on the 17th, which was blocked by flood prevention members Jiang Xiangwu, Chen Shangbin, etc., and did not become a major disaster. The flood prevention enthusiasm of the masses is even higher. When the reporter walked to the Liuyuan flood prevention house in the Second District, he saw an artistic wooden "Flood Prevention Model" sign hanging outside the door. Zhang Zhengkao, the security officer of the village, told the reporter the reasons for winning this model title: "We repair the levee day and night, and the equipment we brought is all good. The tools and materials are well kept, the house is built in accordance with regulations, and we also cultivate soil oxen. Even during airplane bombings, we work the same way." When the reporter asked Zhu Ligan and Jiang Xiangwu how they discovered the leak and how they rushed to block it, after recounting the course of events, he happily pointed to the slogan "Be careful on cloudy, rainy, and dark nights" on the wall and said: "I think we have done it!" Nanwang Village also won the "Model" title. Wang Zhengchu, the security officer of the village, told him that in addition to the same conditions as Liuyuan, he also said, "I don't sleep at night. There have been no mistakes in passing the sign. When passing the sign, I walk on the levee by the river, and when I come back, I walk on the back of the river, always watching for leaks. Even if the plane comes, I don't run away. No matter what, I must protect the levee." The reporter saw the prepared materials neatly placed under the levee and the top of the levee, with a soil ox prepared every five to ten meters. In addition to such thousands of conscious and self-saving flood prevention masses, I deeply felt that if there were no Chiang's bombing and breaching of the dikes, there would be complete confidence and assurance in flood prevention. When the reporter prayed along the *dao*? after dark, all the flood prevention houses turned on their lights. One person carried a lamp, and the other followed behind the lamp, patrolling the levee. Looking from afar at the thousands of red lights, like brilliant stars, showing the glory of the victory of flood prevention on the levee line.

　　黄河防泛记
    君·谦
    【本报冀鲁豫二十九日电】分社记者君谦报导黄河防泛称：大泛未来前，黄河北岸六百余里长的堤防线上，每隔二百公尺即建筑一防泛屋或窝铺，每个防泛屋，有二人至十人，经常探视水情，大泛一来，沿堤十五里以内的群众，即积极带着抢险护堤的工具和工料涌上了堤坝。濮县防泛指挥部对这一护堤防泛工作，做的特别，除了经常的督促检查，组织检查组，分期举行三次大检查：第一次是检查防泛的一切准备，此次检查结果二区夺得金字奖匾。记者为了了解濮县群众护堤防泛的情形，在十八日上午随送匾群众沿大堤至二区防泛指挥辛庄集视察，一上堤便见浑浊黄水，正波涛汹涌，如万马奔腾，轰鸣怪叫，声闻数里。前李桥及中李桥等河床村，已尽被淹于水中。此次大泛虽在当天八时即已停涨，但每防泛屋却仍有十名防泛群众，他们正积极工作，有的从背河堤坝外抬土填平雨水冲的，有的晒被雨湿了的抢险用的干草，或晒湿土备装麻袋做抢险用，每防泛屋都准备有草布袋等十八种防泛抢险用的器材。另外每小区还高悬着一口大钟及铁四个，每区备小船一只及秫秸十余万斤，每个防泛屋壁上，画有护堤防泛的漫画及“坚定与蒋水军做斗”的标语。防泛屋盖得坚固而整齐，屋里屋外各种器材均陈列得井井有条，假如夜间出了险需用什么东西抢救时，没有灯光也可以伸手将所需的东西取到而不会错乱，在黄堤各段上，黑板报的设备也很完善。二区东桑庄的黑板报上就写着十七日大王庄发现漏洞，被防泛员姜相武、陈尚斌等堵塞未成巨灾的消息。群众防泛热情更加高涨。记者走到二区柳园防泛屋，看见门外悬着一个艺术的木质“防泛模范”牌，该村公安员张正考告诉记者夺得此模范理由道：俺不论白天黑夜，一个劲的修补堤坝，带来的器材没有孬的。工具工料保管的好，屋子盖的合乎规定，还要培植土牛，就是在飞机轰炸中，也一样的干。当记者访问朱李干、姜相武怎样发现漏洞和怎样抢堵时，他在讲完事情的经过后，又很欢欣的指着屋墙上的“阴雨黑夜要小心”的标语说：俺算做到了！”又南王村也得了“模范牌”，该村公安员王正除告以和柳园相同的条件外，并说“俺夜间不睡觉，传签时没有误过事，传签去时在临河坝走，回来在背河走，时刻在察看是否出了漏子，就是飞机来了，也不跑，无论如何要保住堤”。记者见到堤坝下整齐的摆着的备防料和堤顶，每隔五公尺至十公尺即有一土牛的准备，再加上这样千百自觉自救的防泛群众，便深感到假如没蒋的轰炸决堤，防泛是完全有信心和有把握的。当记者于天黑后沿》祷?时，各防泛屋都起了灯，一人提着灯，一人跟在灯后，沿堤坝巡逻，远望那千百红灯，好像灿烂的明星，在堤防线上，显示出防泛胜利的光辉。
