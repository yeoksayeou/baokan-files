    Boyan Base Point
    Selects Weeding Model Workers
    [This newspaper reported] Village cadres from the six villages of Zhuangyan, Luoyu, Nanbei Wenzhang, Shuangyuquan, and Boyan at the Boyan Base Point in Wu'an County held a base point meeting on the 19th of last month to discuss weeding. Everyone put forward slogans such as "Weeding with a hoe brings rain, protecting seedlings in dry weather, weed quickly, and one early weeding is better than topdressing." They also set a plan to complete the first weeding in seven days, with a competition and challenge, and inspection and evaluation. After the meeting, each cadre returned to their village and actively led the masses, striving to become models. Yang Changqing, the political director of Nanbei Wenzhang, used accounting methods to tell the masses: If each laborer in the village weeds 2.4 mu per day, the plan cannot be completed. What should be done? Everyone suggested not taking a nap during lunch break, and women also went to the fields, so that the task could be completed by organizing. In Boyan, women and children also went to the fields. They got up when the bell rang before dawn every day. Instead of holding meetings at night, they used a loudspeaker to convey matters, and arranged things during rest the next day. Model workers were immediately commended upon discovery. The blackboard bulletin in Seven Street wrote about the model subordinate Wen San. Song Liuzhu, a military family member in One Street, said: My mutual aid group has thirteen people and has brought along three lazy people. I have not let anyone cultivate the land on my behalf. Our group is determined to become a model. The women's group led by Feng Guiting weeded 87 mu in six days with 23 people, averaging more than six fen per person per day. Chen Juye weeded four mu in three days. On the last day, a clean sweep was proposed, and people were transferred from other streets to support those with more land. Finally, the whole village completed the task. After everyone's efforts, on the 27th, each village sent inspectors to check, and finally Zhuangyan and Boyan won the title of model workers, based on the criteria that the seedlings were weeded completely, weeded well, and many people were organized. In total, the six villages weeded 19,148 mu of land for the first time in seven days. (Wu'an People's Small Newspaper)

    [This newspaper reported] Cadres from Shi Song Village in the Sixth District of Gaoping County held a meeting in Houzhuang. After returning to the village on July 8th, they actively mobilized various mutual aid groups to launch a surprise weeding campaign. The whole village had 150 full laborers and 28 semi-laborers, who reorganized 22 mutual aid groups. They started a surprise weeding campaign for the second time on July 8th, including 1,330 mu of millet seedlings, 237 mu of corn, and more than 400 mu of cotton. They weeded four times and finished all weeding in ten days. According to the labor required for these lands, it should have cost 1,970 workdays, but it was completed with 1,640 workdays, saving 330 workdays. (Gaoping Public Newspaper)

    [This newspaper reported from Licheng] Wang Jucai, a labor hero from Qiushulin in the Third District, conducted a summary of the entire mutual aid society on July 28th to further promote seedling protection and prepare for production and famine. Over the past month, the 53 households in the entire society have saved 775.5 jin of millet and 386.4 jin of corn. The main experiences are: (1) Everyone recalled the famine in 1943 and recognized the severity of this year's disaster; (2) Led by Wang Jucai, each household formulated a saving plan; (3) Groups inspected and competed with each other, challenging to make contributions; (4) They recognized that saving was still to support the front line. By mastering these four experiences, the above achievements were obtained. Wang Jucai took the lead in organizing children to dig medicinal herbs. He alone dug two baskets in one day. Under his influence, 26 people in the society dug 150 jin of medicinal herbs. Selling them at an average price of 300 yuan per jin would earn 45,000 yuan. After such a detailed summary, everyone's enthusiasm for production was enhanced, and the seedling protection work was promoted. The whole society has a total of 29.9 mu of cotton, 24.6 mu of golden queen corn, 59 mu of direct-seeded corn, and 91.5 mu of millet. Under the leadership of Wang Jucai, the corn has all been weeded once and is beginning to be weeded a second time. The millet has all been weeded once, and the cotton has been weeded four times. The crops in the whole ditch are now chest-deep, and the people in the whole ditch are very happy. In order to produce more grain, the whole society has formulated a plan to increase production, guaranteeing that the millet will be weeded twice, the corn three times, and the cotton five times. They will take time to dig medicinal herbs to solve the difficulty of spending money, and propose that every household should not sell a grain of grain, but save food to tide over the famine. A production, seedling protection, and famine preparation movement has been launched in the whole ditch. (Qiushuyuan Communication Group)
