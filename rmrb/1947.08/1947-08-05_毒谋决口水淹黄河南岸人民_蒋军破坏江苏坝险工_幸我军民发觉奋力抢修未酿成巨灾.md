Xinhua News Agency, Jinji Luyu, 3rd: Chiang Kai-shek's bandits directed a large number of secret agents to sabotage our dangerous Yellow River embankment, and another incident was discovered by the militia of Yuncheng. On July 20th, more than ten hemp ropes were found cut at the bottom of the second dike of the Jiangsu Dike, a major dangerous project. The local militia immediately conducted a search near the dangerous project and found several dike ropes in the homes of Zhao Jinshan and Zhao Zhongchen in Zhao Village. The two criminals were sent to the Juancheng government for interrogation. The two criminals confessed that they were instructed by Chiang's secret agents to cut the ropes at the bottom of the Jiangsu Dike three times. They also stated that they used to work at the Jiangsu Dike and were very familiar with the situation of the dangerous project. Cutting the hemp ropes at the bottom of the dike would not be easily seen, and once a major flood arrived, the dike could be breached. Chiang's utterly inhumane poisonous plot has aroused the utmost indignation among the people along the river.

This newspaper reports: The Chiang Kai-shek troops on the south bank of the Yellow River are continuing their sabotage crimes at the three major dangerous projects under their control in Gaocun, Dongming, Zhukou, Liuzhuang, Heze, and Jiangsu Dike, Juancheng. All kinds of materials for repairing the dikes, such as iron wire, hemp rope, and stones, have been completely removed. On the 22nd, dozens of Chiang's secret agents cut away the large hemp ropes of the second and third dikes of the Jiangsu Dike. According to two captured secret agents, they were ordered to sabotage the dangerous project. On the same day, the Chiang's army cavalry regiment suddenly attacked the Linpuji dangerous project in Juancheng County, using machine guns to disperse our dike-repairing masses, causing about 100 meters thick of the protective dike at that place to be unable to be repaired and thrown into the Yellow River. The flood has now risen by one meter compared to last month, and the situation where the dike foundation has been washed away is extremely serious. If it cannot be repaired, the dike will break in the middle, causing a major flood. Chiang's army's conspiracy is obviously to control the Linpuji dangerous project in Juancheng, in order to breach the dike and flood hundreds of miles of people in the second and third districts of Jilu Yu, such as Heze, Juancheng, and Yuncheng, to save Chiang Kai-shek's disastrous fate in the battles north of the Longhai Railway since last month. In order to resolutely oppose Chiang Kai-shek's dike-breaking conspiracy and save the lives of millions of people in the Yellow River flooded area, our Jilu Yu Administrative Office held an emergency flood prevention meeting of the counties along the river on the 23rd and organized a nine-county commando team to carry out emergency repairs. In areas where Chiang's army may harass, armed guerrilla teams are organized to cover the repairs; in terms of manpower and straw materials, the counties do their best to coordinate. Now, hundreds of thousands of people along the river are transporting stones and straw materials overnight. At present, the dam from Aoshan County to Zhonggudui in northern Yuncheng has been largely repaired on the 27th, and repairs are continuing in other sections.

Xinhua News Agency, Jinji Luyu, 3rd: The reporter learned the following about the process of the Liu Ruming department of Chiang's army destroying the Jiangsu Dike dangerous project, which is related to the lives of millions of people on the south bank of Henan: Before the Chiang's army attacked, Chiang's secret agents, taking advantage of the imminent flood season, secretly cut more than 1,000 kilograms of hemp ropes and 160 kilograms of iron wire from the bottom of the Jiangsu Dike, and stole more than 300 wooden stakes, making the dam precarious for a time. The Juancheng Democratic Government immediately urgently mobilized 1,500 workers to rush to repair it day and night, turning danger into safety. Chiang Kai-shek then transferred a cavalry brigade from Hu Zongnan's department from Zhengzhou, under the command of Liu Ruming, and openly advertised the occupation of Juancheng and the opening of the Yellow River dike. On the 25th of last month, taking advantage of the heavy rain, they raided the Jiangsu Dike. The local people's armed forces bravely resisted upon hearing the news, annihilating an entire company at Yangguai, ten miles south of the dike, killing more than 20, capturing more than 40, and seizing 45 foreign horses. On the morning of the 29th, the cavalry brigade, in conjunction with two regiments of the 68th Division, attacked again, occupying the North Dike, which was only a mile away from the Jiangsu Dike. The militia of the fifth and sixth districts of Juancheng, in coordination with the troops, held their ground and stubbornly resisted the enemy. The dike repair workers continued to bravely rush to repair the dike under the enemy's rain of artillery fire. Liu Quanyi from Liuzhuang, the seventh district, carried 14 sorghum stalks at a time, and Liu Xiaosan, a 14-year-old member of the children's corps, carried six sorghum stalks each time. He said: "It is glorious to die on the dam, otherwise, we will be drowned if there is a breach!" At twelve o'clock, four Chiang Kai-shek heavy bombers came to the dam to bomb and strafe, cooperating with the Chiang's army's fierce attack, and the dam was occupied. The Chiang's army immediately destroyed three crossbeams of the dangerous project and dug a breach in the dike of more than ten feet. Fortunately, our defending troops, realizing the critical situation, under the slogan of "coexisting with the Jiangsu Dike," desperately counterattacked and quickly recaptured the area, and assisted the masses in repairing it.

Xinhua News Agency, Jinji Luyu, 3rd: The Jilu Yu Administrative Office recently issued a circular commending the dike-protecting and rescue models Meng Hongjiu, Wu Xianlun, and Zhong Weichun, and gave all the rescue personnel in the Yunbei section a major merit once. On July 5th, the Zhongdui dangerous project in Yunbei (newly established county, north of Yuncheng County) section showed a dangerous situation due to the destruction by the Chiang's army. The slope surface was flooded twice, and Chiang's planes continued to fly low and harass in the air. The situation was extremely critical. Meng Hongjiu, the section chief of the section, personally led all the staff to bravely rush to repair. Wu Xianlun, a dam engineer, did not step off the dam for three days and three nights at the most tense time, and did not eat for a day and a night, and was so tired that he fell ill. However, after only one day of rest, he returned to work on the dam with his illness. Zhong Weichun, the chairman of the Farmers Association of Zhongdui Village, insisted on repairing the dike on the slope at the most dangerous time, and called on the masses: "We will not come down from the slope even if we die if we don't complete the task." Under their spirit of sacrificing for the people, the dangerous situation was finally eliminated and danger was turned into safety by the evening of the 29th.

Xinhua News Agency, Jinji Luyu, 3rd: The Jilu Yu Administrative Office and the Yellow River Commission decided that because the dikes on the south bank were severely damaged during the occupation of the Chiang's army and the repair project was huge, the original Third Repair and Defense Office will specialize in leading the projects in the sections of Juancheng, Yuncheng, Shouzhang, and Aoshan on the south bank in the future, while the projects in the sections of Puyang, Fanxian, Shouzhang, and Zhangqiu on the north bank will be managed by another Fifth Repair and Defense Office.

    毒谋决口水淹黄河南岸人民
    蒋军破坏江苏坝险工
    幸我军民发觉奋力抢修未酿成巨灾
    【新华社晋冀鲁豫三日电】蒋贼指使大批特务，破坏我黄堤险工阴谋，又被我郓城民兵查获一起。七月二十日，在大险工江苏坝之第二道坝底，发现被割断麻绳十余根，当地民兵即于该险工附近进行清查，在赵村赵金山、赵中臣两家清出坝绳数条，当将二犯送交鄄城政府审讯，该二犯供认彼等受蒋特指使，在江苏坝底割绳三次。并称彼等过去均在江苏坝作工，对该险工情形极为熟悉，割断坝底之麻绳，不容易看出，待大泛一到，即可决堤。蒋贼此一绝灭人性之毒谋，已激起沿河人民切齿愤慨。
    【本报讯】黄河南岸蒋军，正在其控制之东明高村，菏泽朱口、刘庄，鄄城江苏坝三大险工处，继续其破坏罪行。当地修堤之铁丝、麻绳、石料等各种器材，均已全部运走。二十二日，蒋记特务数十人，又将江苏坝第二、三坝之大麻绳割走。据捕获之两特务称：彼等系受命破坏该险工而来者。同日，蒋军骑兵团又突然袭击鄄城县境之临濮集险工，用机枪将我整险修堤群众驱散，致该处堤岸约百公尺厚的护坝，无法整修而扔入黄水中。现大水已较上月续涨一公尺，堤基被冲垮之处，情况至为严重。若再不能补修，堤坝即将腰断，造成大泛。蒋军此一阴谋，很明显是欲控制鄄城临濮集险工，以便于决口淹我菏泽、鄄城、郓城等冀鲁豫二、三分区数百里人民，挽救蒋介石上月以来在陇海以北地区作战的惨败命运。为坚决反对蒋介石破堤阴谋，挽救黄泛区数百万人之生命，我冀鲁豫行署又于二十三日召开沿河各县防泛紧急会议，并组织九县突击队，进行抢险修坝。在蒋军可能出扰的地区，则组织武装游击队掩护抢修；在人力秸料等方面，各县则尽力调剂，现沿河数十万群众，正在连夜运送石头和秸料。目前＠山县至郓北仲固堆大堤，已于二十七日大部修完，其他各段，抢修正在继续中。
    【新华社晋冀鲁豫三日电】记者探息蒋军刘汝明部破坏关系河南岸千百万人民生命之江苏坝险工经过如次：在蒋军进攻前，蒋特以大泛已届，即在江苏坝偷割坝底之麻绳一千余斤，铁丝一百六十斤，盗去木桩三百多根，一时该坝岌岌可危。鄄城民主政府当即紧急动员一千五百工人，星夜抢修，转危为安。蒋贼乃又自郑州调来胡宗南部骑一旅，归刘汝明指挥，公开宣传占领鄄城扒开黄堤。于上月廿五日，乘大雨奔袭江苏坝，人民地方武装闻讯英勇迎击，在坝正南十里之杨拐将其歼灭一个整连，击毙二十余，俘四十余，缴洋马四十五匹。二十九日上午，骑一旅又配合六八师二个团再次进扑，当被侵占与江苏坝相隔里许之北大堤，鄄城五、六区民兵配合部队坚持阵地，与敌顽抗。修堤工人则在敌人如雨炮火下继续英勇抢修，七区刘庄刘全义一次搬十四个秫秸，十四岁的儿童团员刘小三每次搬秫秸六个，他说：“死在坝上是光荣的，要不缺了口也得淹死！”迨十二时，蒋记重轰炸机四架来坝上投弹扫射，配合蒋军猛攻，该坝遂被侵占。蒋军当即将险工三处横木破坏，并掘堤丈余，幸我守堤部队以形势危急，在“与江苏坝共存亡”的口号下，拚命反扑，迅速将该地夺回。并协助群众修复。
    【新华社晋冀鲁豫三日电】冀鲁豫区行署，顷通令嘉奖护堤抢险模范孟洪九、吴先伦、仲维春，并予郓北段全体抢修人员各记大功一次。七月五日，郓北（新设县，在郓城县北）段仲＠堆险工，因遭蒋军破坏突出险象，埽面两次出水，蒋机更不断在上空低飞盘旋骚扰，情况万分危急，该段段长孟洪九亲率全体员工奋勇抢修。大坝师吴先伦在最紧张时，曾三天三夜未下坝一步，一天一夜未吃饭，因而累病，但仅休息一天后，即又带病上坝工作。仲＠堆村农会会长仲维春在最危险时，亲在埽上坚持抢修，号召群众：“完不成任务，死也不下埽。”在他们这种为人民不惜牺牲的精神下，至二十九日傍晚，终于消除险象，转危为安。
    【新华社晋冀鲁豫三日电】冀鲁豫区行署及黄委会因南岸堤坝在蒋军侵占时破坏极多，抢修工程浩大，特决定原第三修防处今后专门领导南岸之鄄（城）、郓（城）、寿（张）、＠（山）、等段工程，北岸之濮（县）、范（县）、寿（张）、张（秋）段工程则另设第五修防处管理。
