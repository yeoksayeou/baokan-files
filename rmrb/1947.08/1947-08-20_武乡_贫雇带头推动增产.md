　　Poor and Hired Peasants Lead the Drive to Increase Production

　　[Reported from Wuxiang by this newspaper] Since the heavy rain on July 28th, the County Party Committee has called on Party members to take the lead in uniting the masses, completely eliminate wasteland, and rush to replant late crops such as buckwheat and autumn vegetables. According to statistics from 46 villages in the county, within ten days, 3410 mu of cultivated wasteland and 102.5 mu of virgin wasteland were eliminated. In addition to planting all these wastelands with buckwheat and vegetables, buckwheat and vegetables were also planted in the wheat stubble fields. The main experiences of the movement are threefold: First, by calculating the big picture, the cadres' thinking was cleared, and by calculating the small picture, the masses' thinking was cleared. Therefore, the thinking of leaders at all levels and the masses was very clear and conscious. First of all, the county leadership made calculations based on the actual situation and harvest of the whole county, clearly recognizing that each person lacked 6.5 dou of grain for food alone. Therefore, the cadres' paralysis and blindness were broken, and specific tasks were put forward: each person saved 1 he of rice a day, each household planted one mu more of vegetables, eliminated wasteland, and planted more late crops. Second, like the land reform movement, the poor peasants and hired laborers were used as the backbone to recall the famine, complain about the suffering of the famine, and use the spirit of fighting feudalism to fight against the famine. Li Jinwu from Yangtaowan, Third District, said: "Before, I had no land. During the famine in 1943, there were three people in my family, and there was not even one he of grain. We only ate chaff and hemp sprouts, and I couldn't defecate. I almost starved to death. Now that I have land, I must produce and save well! I can teach fine water to flow slowly, but I can't teach difficult defecation." Third, launching a campaign to establish merit and commend models has inspired production enthusiasm. For example, the masses in Chengguan have set standards for establishing merit and are in high spirits. Each person saves 1 he of rice a day to establish a small merit, collects 50 jin of vegetables every five days to establish a small merit, does not buy food when going to market or attending meetings to establish a small merit, and each person eliminates one mu of wasteland to establish a big merit, etc. (Fang, Jinggang)

　　武乡
  　贫雇带头推动增产
    【本报武乡讯】自七月二十八号普降透雨后，县委号召党员起带头作用团结群众，彻底消灭荒地，突击补种荞麦秋菜等晚作物。据全县四六个村的统计，在十天内，消灭熟荒三四一○亩，生荒一○二·五亩，除把这些荒地全部种成荞麦和菜外，还在回茬麦地里种荞麦和菜。运动开展的主要经验有三点：第一：是用算大帐打通干部思想，算小帐打通群众思想，因此各级领导和群众的思想，都很明确自觉。首先是县的领导上根据全县的实情和收成，作了计算，明确认识到每人光食粮就缺六·五斗，因此打破了干部的麻痹与盲目性，提出了具体任务，每人一天节约一合米，每户多种一亩菜，消灭荒地多种晚作物。第二：是和土改运动一样，以贫雇佃为骨干回忆灾荒，向灾荒展开诉苦，用斗封建的精神和灾荒作斗争。三区杨桃湾李晋武说：从前我没土地，四三年灾荒家有三口人，家无一合粮，净是吃些糠和麻生，大便不下来，几乎饿死；现在我有了土地可得好好生产节省啦！能教细水长流不能教大便难受。第三：开展立功表模运动，鼓舞了生产热情。如城关群众订出了立功标准，情绪很高，每人每天节一合米立一小功，五天集菜五十斤立一小功，赶集开会不买吃立一小功，每人消灭一亩荒地立一大功等。（芳、景岗）
