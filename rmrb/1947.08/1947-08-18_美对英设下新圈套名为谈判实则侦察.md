　　Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, August 16th: Comprehensive reports indicate that Marshall's attempt to use relaxed conditions as a means to get Britain to accept its new noose is becoming increasingly clear. According to US Treasury Secretary Snyder on the 12th, US-British negotiations on revising the financial agreement will begin in Washington on the 18th. He also stated, "The negotiations will be limited to the existing loan agreement and will not discuss new loans." Regarding the US's purpose in the negotiations, US Acting Secretary of State Lovett told reporters on the 15th, "The negotiations will allow the US to obtain more details about the British economic situation." According to Agence France-Presse on the 12th, some US officials revealed that the US will require the British delegation coming to Washington to discuss revising the loan agreement to first fully explain how Britain is spending US loans. The report also stated that these officials even doubt whether the revisions suggested by Attlee (namely, revising the "non-discrimination against US goods" and "free convertibility of the gold pound" clauses) can significantly help the British situation. Some observers in Washington believe that this US statement reveals Wall Street's attempt to take the opportunity to probe Britain's internal situation and make new expansion plans against Britain. It also aims to delay negotiations on revising the loan conditions, forcing Britain to accept the US plan to control the Ruhr at the Ruhr coal production conference currently underway in Washington. According to a TASS dispatch on the 14th, the London Daily Mail's New York correspondent had similar feelings, saying, "The dollar is a dictator, and the dollar is issuing rude questions." "I don't think there is a one or two percent chance that the United States will provide further assistance to Britain this year, and even writing a check next spring will require a miracle."

　　美对英设下新圈套名为谈判实则侦察
    【新华社陕北十六日电】综合报导：马歇尔以放宽对英条件为使英国接受其新的套绳之企图，已日益明显。据美财长斯奎德十二日称，英美关于修改财政协定的谈判，将于十八日开始在华府举行。并称：“谈判将以现有之贷款协定为限，而并不讨论新贷款。”关于谈判之美方目的，美代理国务卿罗维特十五日向记者称：“谈判将使美方获悉关于英国经济情况之更多详情。”据法新社十二日电称，美国若干官员透露：美国将要求来华府讨论修改贷款协定的英方代表团，首先充分解释英国在如何花费美国之贷款。该电并称：这些官员甚至怀疑艾德礼所建议的修改（即修改“不歧视美货”与“金镑自由兑换”条款），是否能对英国局势有很多帮助。华府某些观察家认为，美国此种表示，显露华尔街图趁机探悉英国的内部情况，作新的对英扩张计划。并图拖延修改贷款条件之谈判，逼使英国在正于华府进行的鲁尔煤产会议中接受美国控制鲁尔之计划。据塔斯社十四日电，伦敦每日邮报纽约访员对此有类似感触称：“金元是独裁者，金元正在发出蛮横的诘问”。“我不认为美国今年有百分之一、二的机会对英作进一步的援助，而且就是明春开支票也需要有奇迹才行。”
