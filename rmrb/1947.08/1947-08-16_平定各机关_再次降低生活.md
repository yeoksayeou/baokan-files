　　Pacifying Various Agencies
  　Reducing Living Standards Again
    [This newspaper, Pingding] Our county has been experiencing drought. Since the beginning of summer, there has been no rain. Under these circumstances, Comrade Zhao Yuting, the County Secretary, convened a meeting of responsible cadres from all agencies in the county on "August 1st" to discuss further austerity measures for the agencies, to overcome the drought, and to help the masses water their seedlings. After the meeting, all agencies formulated specific plans. The County Committee saves six liang of grain every day, the County Government does not eat white flour, the Bank saves five liang, and the Post Office seven liang. All agencies gather wild vegetables to mix with their food. The County Committee eats elm leaves with dry rations, and in addition to eating them, they also accumulated a portion. The County Government gathered 379 jin of wild vegetables in three days. The County Cooperative has a total of sixteen people, each with a daily food allowance of two jin of rice and a consumption of 25 liang of rice. They plan to save 25 liang of food allowance rice and 7 liang of consumption rice every day. The entire cooperative will save 32 jin of rice per day, five jin of rice per month on lamp oil, and each person will gather ten jin of dried vegetables per month. They have also opened up two mu of wasteland to grow autumn vegetables. Individuals do not smoke or drink alcohol. According to this calculation, they can save enough for one month's needs each month. Starting from August, according to the plan, they will be able to survive five months of famine by the end of the year. Starting on the afternoon of August 1st, County Secretary Zhao personally led the County Committee, the County Government, and other agencies to help the masses in the Chengguan District water their seedlings together. By August 6th, they had watered over eleven qing in five days. (Xiufeng, Xiaoyun, Tingdong, Jiyuan, Yaoting)
