Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 7th – Wedemeyer has been in China for over two weeks and is currently touring major cities in the Chiang-controlled areas, both front and rear. Chiang Kai-shek's petty court is obsequious, summoning civil and military officials from all provinces to gather in Nanjing, awaiting this master's orders, or serving as followers, such as Chen Cheng and his ilk, accompanying their master through dust and grime, a truly ugly sight of subservience. And this master of Chiang Kai-shek puts on an even uglier show of being the master, referring to all Chinese lackeys who offer advice or plead their case to him as "patriotic elements," insulting the Chinese people and arousing universal indignation and contempt among them. The inside story of Wedemeyer's conspiratorial activities in China has become increasingly exposed over the past two weeks. According to various sources, the U.S. plan to further aid Chiang Kai-shek in the civil war to destroy China was actually formulated before Wedemeyer's arrival. Wedemeyer's claim of "investigation" is merely for show. His real mission is only to obtain Chiang Kai-shek's face-to-face response to the harsh conditions imposed by American imperialists regarding aid to Chiang, which are equivalent to turning China into a colony. According to a July 27th Shanghai dispatch from the Associated Press, the American Chamber of Commerce in Shanghai revealed: "We cannot understand the reason for sending the Wedemeyer mission, which was sent by someone who knows China even better than him (referring to Marshall). Does this mean the government is looking for an excuse to pour more money into China (referring to Chiang's clique)?" A dispatch from Beijing by Agence France-Presse on the 3rd of this month stated even more clearly: "The purpose of the Wedemeyer mission in China is to obtain as soon as possible the Nanjing government's response to the conditions proposed by Washington regarding American aid to China (referring to Chiang). This is the unanimous opinion of Chinese and foreign political circles."
    According to various sources, the American plan to aid Chiang Kai-shek in slaughtering the Chinese people includes: First, re-equipping the Kuomintang with twenty divisions. According to Agence France-Presse, this is based on a "plan" approved before Wedemeyer's arrival in China, with training locations to be set up in Taiwan and training to be the responsibility of Sun Li-jen, the darling of American imperialism. Second, the United States will utilize Japanese military supplies, in the form of opening up trade with Japan or "compensation," to transport them to China to aid Chiang Kai-shek in the civil war. Japanese warships have been successively sailing to China for Chiang to utilize, and negotiations between Japan and Chiang to exchange Chinese raw materials for Japanese rails, locomotives, and carriages have long begun. Not only that, but the United States is further preparing to use a large number of Japanese officers (war criminals) to train Chiang's troops in equipping and training them. According to Hong Kong's "Chinese Commerce Daily," the United States has already transported a large number of Japanese officers to Taiwan. Third, according to highly reliable sources in Nanjing, Wedemeyer also brought a plan for the United States to provide Chiang Kai-shek with a new loan of 1.5 to 2 billion US dollars, a plan first proposed by the Chiang government to the United States in June. Fourth, it is "possible to provide aircraft equipment and other materials to support Nanjing in its war against the Communists" (Associated Press). Fifth, the interventionist troops of American imperialism will continue to be stationed in China. The passage of the extension of the term of extraterritoriality for American troops stationed in China by Chiang's Legislative Yuan on the third of last month has already prematurely revealed this secret.
    The U.S. Wants Chiang to Agree to These Conditions:
    1. The United States Obtains Eight Military Bases
    2. Military and Political Affairs Are Directly Controlled by the U.S.
    3. China's Policy Toward Japan Completely Obeys the United States
    Traitor Chiang Actually Expresses Complete Acceptance!
    According to various sources, American imperialists are by no means bestowing these things upon Chiang Kai-shek as a favor. Before giving them, American imperialists demand that Chiang Kai-shek agree to conditions that are actually tantamount to the destruction of China. That is, first, the United States demands to acquire eight locations, including Taipei, Keelung, Qingdao, Chengdu, Xi'an, and Dihua, as formal U.S. military bases, and through these bases, directly use military force to control all of China as its colony. According to reliable sources from Nanjing, the recognition of these bases is the price for the new loan of 1.5 to 2 billion US dollars. And the plan brought by Wedemeyer has increased by three compared to the five bases that Chiang Kai-shek suggested or agreed to consider selling in June. The secret of Wedemeyer's decision to go to major cities in North China, Northeast China, Taiwan, and West China for "investigation" lies here.
    Second, the United States demands further control of the various departments of Chiang Kai-shek's government. According to a dispatch from Beijing by Agence France-Presse on the 3rd, "Washington desires to completely control the use of US aid to China (referring to Chiang) loans and military supplies. This control will lead to a thorough reorganization of Chinese (referring to Chiang's government) political and military personnel." Regarding direct military control, a TASS dispatch from Nanjing on the 5th, citing a statement by a U.S. colonel published in the "Nanjing People's Daily," stated: "The activities of the U.S. Military Advisory Group in China are not limited to training troops. The advisory group will directly participate in the work of the Chinese Army Headquarters." In terms of finance, economics, and general administration, an Associated Press report from Nanjing on the 24th of last month revealed that the United States will send "advisors" who are only responsible to the U.S. government to supervise the financial expenditures of Chiang's government, and will also send "technical experts" to the general administrative departments of Chiang Kai-shek's government. According to a report from Washington by Agence France-Presse on the 5th, authoritative sources revealed that "an important American economic and military delegation will go to China, and the delegation will supply Chinese (Chiang) civil administration and the army with officials."
    Third, in order to repay Japan for its assistance to Chiang in carrying out the civil war, the United States demands that Chiang Kai-shek, as the second dog of American imperialism in the Far East, be placed under its first dog, reactionary Japan, and thus requires Chiang Kai-shek to completely obey American decisions on the Japan issue, first and foremost to immediately resume trade with Japan and participate in the preparatory conference for a peace treaty with Japan that the United States has arbitrarily convened for the purpose of reviving Japan's aggressive forces. A speech by a "councilor" at a meeting of the Standing Committee of Chiang Kai-shek's Political Council on the 25th of last month confirmed: "One of General Wedemeyer's missions is to make China's (referring to Chiang Kai-shek's) policy toward Japan consistent with the policy of the United States." (Associated Press, Nanjing)
    The mission of the American imperialist Wedemeyer "investigation" team is to have the Chiang Kai-shek authorities agree to these conditions that far exceed the Twenty-One Demands of Japan and lead to the destruction of China. And the traitor Chiang Kai-shek has stated that he will completely accept these conditions. On the first of this month, Chiang Kai-shek personally presided over the "State Council," disregarding the unanimous opposition of the entire country and the centuries of harm to the Chinese nation, and brazenly passed a resolution to immediately resume trade with Japan. On the same day, Chiang Kai-shek also instructed his ambassador in Nanjing to notify the United States that he agreed to participate in the preparatory meeting for a peace treaty with Japan. Chiang Kai-shek is also "extremely willing to fully control the use of aid to China (referring to Chiang) loans and military supplies in accordance with American wishes." (Agence France-Presse) so that the United States can further formally control the military, financial, and administrative departments of China (Chiang's government). Regarding the United States' demand for eight military bases in exchange for loans, Chiang Kai-shek is also prepared to agree to it entirely. According to an Associated Press report from Shanghai on the 3rd: Chiang Kai-shek is prepared to make a "guarantee" before Wedemeyer leaves China "so that the United States will put more money into the sewage ditch of China (referring to Chiang's government)."
    But insightful observers have already recognized that the American aid-Chiang plan, which "infringes on China's sovereignty" - and is actually destroying China - will arouse protests from the Chinese people and further intensify the national revolution against American imperialism and its running dog, Chiang Kai-shek, sending the traitor Chiang Kai-shek to his grave. American imperialism will neither be able to save Chiang Kai-shek nor achieve its goal of enslaving China. Agence France-Presse stated: "The large amount of military supplies that the United States previously supplied to Chiang Kai-shek have all fallen into the hands of the Communists; and most of the loans have not been used 'appropriately'." When Chiang requested a new loan of 1.5 to 2 billion US dollars in June, the American "Afternoon Post" pointed out that this loan would not be able to sustain Chiang Kai-shek's huge civil war expenditures for long. The American imperialist aid-Chiang plan will be a losing adventurous gamble, and even many capitalists in the United States have expressed fierce opposition to it. According to a report by Associated Press reporter Logan from Shanghai on the 1st, full-scale aid to Chiang Kai-shek is also "extremely unfavorable to the United States, because the previous 3 to 4 billion yuan in loans have been wasted, embezzled, and misused. American merchants believe that tens of billions of dollars have been invested in a bottomless pit, so they firmly oppose further loans. They say that this is harmful rather than beneficial to the United States."

    魏德迈来华是要蒋贼答应亡国条件
    美国妄图完全灭亡中国
    中外舆论咸认将更激起中国革命高潮
    美帝国主义决不能挽救蒋党死亡命运
    【新华社陕北七日电】魏德迈抵华已逾两周，目前正在巡游蒋管区前后方各大城市。蒋家小朝庭奴颜婢膝，召集各省文武百僚麇集南京，听候这位主子使唤，或则充任跟班，如陈诚之流，扈从主子仆仆风尘，一副奴才丑相。而这个蒋介石的主子，更是活现一副主人丑架子，凡是向他献策陈情的中国奴才，概称为“爱国分子”，侮辱中国人民，激起了中国人民普遍的愤慨与卑视。魏德迈来华阴谋活动的内情，两周来已愈益暴露。根据各方消息，美国进一步援蒋内战灭亡中国的计划实际上早已在魏德迈来华前拟好，魏德迈扬言“调查”，仅是装装样子，实际任务仅在获得蒋介石对美帝国主义者关于援蒋所做的对许多殖民地化中国的苛刻条件的当面答复。据合众社上月二十七日沪电，上海美商会透露：“我们不能了解派遣魏德迈使团的理由，也被一个比他更了解中国的人（指马歇尔）派来，这是否意味政府正在找借口倾更多的金钱于中国（指蒋家）。”本月三日法国新闻社从北平发出的电讯说得更明白：“魏德迈使团在华之目的，为及早获得南京政府对华盛顿方面关于美国援华（指蒋）所提出条件之答复，这就是中外政界人士一致的意见。”
    美国援助蒋介石屠杀中国人民的计划，据各方消息，其中包括：第一、再给国民党装备二十个师。据法新闻社报导，此系根据魏德迈抵华前所批准的“计划”，其训练地点将设在台湾，训练将由美帝国主义的宠儿孙立群负责。第二、美国将利用日本的军火物资借对日贸易开放或“赔偿”的形式运华助蒋内战。日本军舰已陆续驶华交蒋利用，日蒋双方以中国原料交换日本铁轨、火车头、车厢等谈判亦早已开始。不仅如此，美国还进一步准备在装备与训练蒋军中，使用大批日本军官（战犯）担任训练。据香港华商报息，目前美国已将大批日本军官运抵台湾。第三、据南京方面极可靠消息，魏德迈还带来美国将以十五至二十亿美元的新借款供给蒋介石的计划，此一计划首先系由蒋政府于六月间向美国提出者。第四、还“可能给以飞机装备及其他物资以支持南京对共产党作战”（美联社）。第五、美帝国主义的干涉军将继续留驻中国；上月三日蒋家立法院通过延长驻华美军治外法权的期限，即已预先泄露天机。
    美要蒋答应这些条件：
    一：美国取得八个军事基地
    二：军事政治由美直接控制
    三：对日政策完全服从美国
    蒋贼竟表示全部接受！
    据各方面消息，美帝国主义者绝不是要把这些东西恩赐给蒋介石；在给出之前，美帝国主义者要求蒋介石答应实际上等于灭亡中国的条件。即第一，美国要求取得台北、基隆、青岛、成都、西安、迪化等八地作为美国正式的军事基地，并经过这些基地，直接以军事力量控制全中国为其殖民地。据来自南京的可靠消息，这些基地的承认，即作为十五亿至二十亿元之新借款的代价。而魏德迈所带来的计划，较之六月间蒋介石建议答应或答应考虑出卖的五个基地增加了三个。魏德迈决定赴华北、东北、台湾及华西各大城市“调查”之秘密，也即在此。
    第二，美国要求进一步控制蒋介石政府的各部门。据法新闻社北平三日电称：“华盛顿愿望完全控制美援华（指蒋）的贷款及军火之使用，这个控制将使中国（指蒋政府）政治、军事人员来一个彻底的改组。”关于军事的直接控制，据塔斯社南京五日讯引“南京人报”所载一美国上校谈话称：“美国驻华军事顾问团之活动并不限于训练军队，该顾问团将直接参加中国陆军总部工作。”在财政经济及一般行政方面，上月二十四日美联社记者自南京发出的电讯中，曾透露美国将派遣只对美政府负责的“顾问”，以监督蒋政府的财政开支，亦将派遣“技术专家”至蒋介石政府的一般行政部门中。另据法新闻社五日自华盛顿报导，权威方面透露，将有“一个重要的美国经济军事代表团赴华，该团将供给中国（蒋）民政与军队以官员”。
    第三，为了报答日本对蒋进行内战的帮助，美国要求蒋介石作为美帝国主义在远东的第二号走狗，而居于它的第一号走狗反动日本之下，从而要求蒋介石在对日问题上，完全服从美国的决策，首先是立即恢复对日贸易与参加美国擅自召集而以复活日本侵略势力为目的之对日和约预备会议。上月二十五日蒋家参政会驻委会上一位“参政员”的发言证实：“魏德迈将军的任务之一，就是使中国（指蒋介石）对日政策和美国的政策相一致。”（合众社南京电）
    美帝国主义者魏德迈“调查”团的使命，就是要蒋介石当局答应这些远远超过日本二十一条的灭亡中国的条件。而卖国贼蒋介石则表示将完全接受这些条件。本月一日，蒋介石亲自主持的“国务会议”，不顾举国一致的反对，不顾中华民族百年的祸害，悍然通过立即恢复对日贸易的决议。同日，蒋介石亦已训令其驻京大使通知美国，同意参加对日和约预备会议。蒋介石亦“极愿按照美国愿望来完全控制援华（指蒋）贷款及军火之使用。”（法新社电）使美国得以进一步正式控制中国（蒋政府）的军事、财政及行政的各部门。对于美国要求八个军事基地交换贷款一事，蒋介石亦已准备全部答应。据合众社上海三日电称：蒋介石已准备于魏德迈离华前提出“保证”，“使美国再将金钱投入中国（指蒋政府）的污水沟”。
    但有眼光的观察家业已认识，“侵犯中国主权”——实际上是灭亡中国的美国援蒋计划，将引起中国人民之抗议，更加激进中国全民族反对美帝国主义与其走狗蒋介石的革命高潮，把卖国贼蒋介石送入坟墓去；美帝国主义将既不能挽救蒋介石，也不能达到奴役中国的目的。法国新闻社称：“美国以前供应蒋介石的大量军火，皆落在共产党手中；而大部分贷款也未被‘适当’利用。”美国“下午报”当六月间蒋要求十五亿至二十亿元新借款时即已指出，这一借款将不能长此维持蒋介石庞大的内战支出。美帝国主义的援蒋计划将是一个赔本的冒险赌博，甚至美国许多资本家对此也表示激烈反对。据合众社记者罗根一日自上海报导，全面援助蒋介石，这对美国亦“是极不利的，因为过去三四十亿元的贷款都被浪费了，被贪污被乱用了；美国商人认为数十亿美元已投入无底洞，所以坚决反对再行贷款，他们说这对美国有害而非有利。”
