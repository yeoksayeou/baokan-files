　　Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 11th: Nanjing dispatch: The Chiang government, reneging on its promise made in January of this year to extend the publicly funded student system for another year, formally announced on the 7th the abolition of the publicly funded student system for secondary and higher education institutions, replacing it with a so-called "scholarship system" that is heavily restricted and accounts for only 20 percent of new student admissions. This move will deprive a large number of young people who have been displaced by Chiang Kai-shek's dictatorial civil war of the opportunity to attend school. This is a new form of persecution inflicted on poor students by Chiang Kai-shek after the promulgation of his counter-revolutionary general mobilization order, with the aim of diverting the already meager educational funds to the civil war of slaughtering the people. Note: The publicly funded student system began in 1940, initially called the "loan system," and was renamed in 1945. In January of this year, the Chiang government, in order to ease the student movement at the time, announced the extension of the publicly funded student system for one year, which according to regulations should not have been abolished until after the winter vacation this year.

　　蒋政府取消公费生制度
  　教育经费用于内战
  　迫使大量青年失学
    【新华社陕北十一日电】南京讯：蒋政府自食今年一月间关于延长公费制一年的诺言，已于七日正式宣布废止中等以上学校公费生制度，而代之以限制重重且仅占新生名额百分之二十的所谓“奖学金制度”。此举将使由于蒋介石独裁内战所造成流离失所的大量青年因此失学。这是蒋介石颁布反革命总动员令后所加于穷苦学生的新迫害，其目的在将本来就少得可怜的教育经费，移用于屠杀人民的内战。按：公费生制度始于一九四零年，初名“贷金制度”一九四五年始改今称。今年一月间蒋政府为缓和当时学生运动，曾宣布延长公费制度一年，照规定应至今年寒假后始能宣布废止。
