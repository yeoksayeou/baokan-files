Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 18th. Comprehensive Washington dispatch: In the Anglo-American Ruhr coal production conference, the United States has raised the issue of Americanizing Ruhr coal mine technology and control rights. According to an Agence France-Presse dispatch on the 13th, the US side has proposed to the British side that, as an exchange condition for reducing Britain's financial burden in the Anglo-American occupied zone in Germany, the US side requires Britain to revise the Ruhr coal mine nationalization plan and abandon Britain's sole control over the Ruhr, replacing it with the United States assuming greater responsibility for control. On the 15th, the US side also suggested that the United States supply 600,000 tons of steel bars to the Ruhr. The British side has not yet made a clear statement on this request from the US side. On the 14th, the British side presented statistical materials to show that Ruhr coal production is gradually increasing. By August 9th, Ruhr coal's daily production had reached 235,000 tons. It also stated that the reason for production being lower than pre-war levels was insufficient food, transportation difficulties, and a lack of some coal mine guidance and agency personnel. The British side seemed to be trying to demonstrate that the increase in coal production was unrelated to poor management and inferior technology. On the 14th, the conference formed two subcommittees to study issues such as miners' food and housing. The US delegation participating in this conference consisted of 24 important economic officials, led by Assistant Secretary of State for Economic Affairs, Thorp; the British delegation consisted of eight people, led by Strang, the political advisor to the Deputy Commander of the British occupied zone in Germany. Given the dull atmosphere of the conference, the US side has repeatedly emphasized the informal nature of the meeting.

　　鲁尔煤产会议沉闷美预感收场不乐观
    【新华社陕北十八日电】综合华府讯：在英美鲁尔煤产会议中，美国已提出鲁尔煤矿技术的美国化与控制权问题。据法新闻社十三日电，美方已向英方提出，作为减低英国在德境英美占领区的财政负担之交换条件，美方要求英国修改鲁尔煤矿国有化计划，并放弃英国对鲁尔之单独管制，而代之以由美国担负管制之更大责任。十五日，美方并建议由美国以六十万吨钢条供应鲁尔。对美方此项要求，英方尚无明确表示。十四日英方提出统计材料说明，鲁尔煤产在逐渐增加中，迄八月九日鲁尔煤每日产量已达二十三万五千吨。并称，产量低于战前原因在于粮食不足，运输困难及部分煤矿指导与机关人员的缺乏。英方似拟以此说明煤产之增加与管制不良及技术低劣无关。会议于十四日组成两小组委员会，研究矿工粮食与住宅等问题。参加此次会议之美方代表团，由二十四名重要经济官员组成，团长为美国务院专掌经济事务之助理国务卿索尔普；英方代表团共八人，由德境英占区副司令之政治顾问斯特朗率领。鉴于会议进行之沉闷气氛，美方刻一再强调会议之非正式性质。
