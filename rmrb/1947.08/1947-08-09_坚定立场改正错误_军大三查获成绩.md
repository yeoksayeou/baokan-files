Firmly Stand on Principle and Correct Mistakes:
    Military University #3 Achieves Results in the Three Check-ups
    [This newspaper reports] On the eve of "August 1st" (Army Day), the Military and Political University launched a fervent Three Check-ups movement. All cadres, students, and soldiers were swept into this tide. Lasting for a week, after preparation through deliberation and introspective discussions, the movement began to thoroughly examine landlord ideology, hedonistic thinking, corruption and waste, degeneration, ideas about status and reputation, reluctance to work diligently, disobedience to the organization, and contempt for production and thrift… and other erroneous thoughts. For example, Comrade Zhang Ya, a researcher at the school’s political research department, came from a landlord family, and his father was a local tyrant. In the past, he was always afraid that his family would be struggled against and that his father would be beaten, so he was often mentally uneasy and dissatisfied with the mass struggle. During the Three Check-ups, he thoroughly examined this thinking and wrote a letter to the local government and the masses, stating: "I want to stand with the poor peasants and launch a struggle against my family, demanding the return of the blood and sweat debts owed to the peasants. My attitude towards my family is that however the masses want to struggle, that's how it will be, and I completely believe in and support it." He also revealed to the masses the silver dollars, copper coins, and the four hidden cellars where things were secretly buried in his home. Comrade Xu Zhi'an, a student in the First Great Brigade, had embezzled 80,000 yuan in horse feed money and production expenses when he was a communications squad leader in a front-line unit in the past. During the Three Check-ups, he deeply reviewed this mistake and said with tears: "My aunt and sister were raped by landlords, and my father was killed by landlords, but I embezzled revolutionary property. I am so sorry for the revolution!" He immediately wrote a letter to Political Commissar Liu of his original unit, handing over all 80,000 yuan to the organization. Students in the Fourth Great Brigade had hidden a lot of captured materials during combat in the front-line units. During the Three Check-ups, they recognized the importance of production and thrift and turning over captured items to the public, and they opened their packages one after another and took them out to hand them over. Through the Three Check-ups, many students have put down the heavy burden on their minds and feel relaxed and happy. (Mei Cun)

    坚定立场改正错误
    军大三查获成绩
    【本报讯】军政大学于“八一”前夕，掀起了热烈的三查运动。全体干部、学员、战士、都卷进了这个浪潮。历时一周，经过酝酿准备、反省讨论，开始清算了地主思想、享乐思想、贪污浪费、腐化堕落、地位名誉观念、不安心工作、不服从组织、轻视生产节约……等各种错误思想。如校政研究员张亚同志，家中是个地主，父亲是个恶霸，他过去一贯害怕家中挨斗，父亲被打，因此时常思想不安，对群众斗争不满。在三查中，清算了这种思想，写信给当地政府及群众称：“我要和贫苦农民站在一起，向我家展开斗争，索还农民的血汗债。我对家庭的态度是群众要怎样斗便怎样斗，我完全相信与赞助的，”并把他家地下埋的银元、铜元，及秘密埋藏东西的四个暗窑，都告密给群众。一大队学员徐治安同志，过去在前方部队当通讯班长时，曾贪污马粮款、生产费八万元，三查中，他深刻检讨了这一错误，痛哭流涕的说：“我的姑姑、姐姐，都被地主奸污，父亲被地主杀死，而自己还贪污革命财产，太对不起革命了！”立即写信给原部队的刘政委，将此八万元，全部交给组织。四大队学员，在前方部队作战中，隐藏了许多胜利物资，三查中，认识了生产节约，缴获归公的重要，纷纷打开包袱，取出交公。经过三查，不少学员放下了思想上沉重的包袱，感到轻松愉快。（梅村）
