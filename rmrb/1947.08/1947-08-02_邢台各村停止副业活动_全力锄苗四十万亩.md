    [Xingtai News] Due to uneven rainfall in Xingtai, seedlings emerged at different times. Weeding began at the start of this month. Currently, 400,000 mu out of the county's 500,000 mu of seedlings have been weeded for the first time, accounting for 80% of the total. The remaining un-weeded seedlings were planted after the rain on the 15th and 16th of this month and are now starting to be weeded. Under the slogan "Apply fertilizer to the top of the seedlings while weeding," all villages completely stopped sideline activities during the weeding period. Men, women, old, and young all worked together, first weeding the land of military families, then their own. Huang Yuju from Huangmeihua Village weeded while replanting late crops. After weeding, most villages spare time for sideline activities, with old liberated areas going to newly liberated areas for short-term labor. Liu Jide's team from Zhucun in the first district earned 8,000 yuan for four people in two days doing short-term labor. Dou Quangui's team from Hehui Village led team members to scrape saline soil and boil salt after weeding. Five people scraped five small carts a day, earning 4,000 yuan per cart, totaling 100,000 yuan in five days. Many villages exchanged locust seeds for millet at the county community after weeding. Longhua Village in the fifth district, after sifting, handed in over 100 jin of locust seeds, which could be exchanged for over 500 jin of millet. Huangsi in the sixth district, Shixiang in the second district, and other villages are reclaiming wasteland after weeding, preparing to plant large quantities of vegetables and buckwheat in preparation for lean years. Dongbaishan in the fifth district has weeded twice. With a large competition among the eight teams in the village, all of the village's more than 1,000 mu of seedlings were weeded in three and a half days, saving 200 workdays for 298 male and female laborers. Waterlogged land in the first and second districts has already been weeded three or four times. (Chang Yan)
    [Jinan News, 31st] The Liu Cuimiao Movement, a banner for military families, has been enthusiastically launched in over a hundred villages and towns in Ji, Zaoqiang, and Hengshui counties. Xie Xinge, an elderly military family member in her sixties from Xishage, Ji County, not only manages her sixteen mu of land without assistance but also helps neighbors with production. She has now been selected as the work allocation team leader, leading the women of the village to weed together. She wraps the weeds around her waist while weeding, saying happily, "Weeding the land and feeding the cattle are both taken care of, saving two sheng of feed every day." Li Yaolan, a military family member from Xinzhuang, is only twenty years old and capable in both farming and weaving. She never asks for help when carrying water and planting crops. When the village offered to cultivate her land after the recent heavy rain, she declined. However, due to her illness, village cadres persuaded her, but she still insisted on rushing to plant with everyone. She is now leading women to weed for the third time. The military family members of Dongzjie Village in Zaoqiang, Liu Guifu and Liu Guilin, declined the offer of the masses to cultivate their land for them, saying, "I can cultivate it myself, so don't add burden to the villagers." After summing up the substitute cultivation of military families in Fengjiazhuang in the third district of Hengshui, military families in the entire district have requested to cultivate their own land, all saying, "The front lines are killing enemies and making meritorious service, and we at home must also make meritorious service in production." The military family models in over a hundred villages are all striving to learn from Liu Cuimiao. (Note: Liu Cuimiao is a model military family member who relies on self-reliance).
    [Neiqiu News] Under the leadership of Instructor Zhou, all seventy or eighty workers of a certain arsenal did not rest on Sundays but participated in mutual aid teams in the villages in a planned way to help the masses weed green seedlings. On Sunday, July 20th, the workers helped the masses weed about 30 mu of seedlings in one day. Every evening, during their spare time after work, they carried water for the masses, which was supported by the local masses. (Wen De)

    【本报邢台讯】邢台因落雨先后不齐，苗出的有迟有早，自本月初开始锄起苗，现在全县五十万亩苗已有四十万亩锄出头遍，占总数百分之八十。下余未锄的系本月十五、六号这场雨种的，现亦开始锄。在苗锄寸顶上粪的口号下，在锄苗期间各村完全停止了副业活动。男女老少一齐下手，先锄军属地，后锄自己地。黄梅花村黄玉聚一面锄一面补种晚庄稼。大部村锄完苗后抽空搞副业，老区纷纷到新区打短工。一区祝村刘计德组打短工，四个人两天赚洋八千元。河会豆全贵组锄完苗带领组员刮盐土熬盐，五个人一天刮五小车，一车赚洋四千元，刮了五天赚洋十万元。很多村锄罢苗把槐籽到县社区社换小米，五区龙化一个村除筛簸外净交槐籽一百余斤，可换米五百多斤。六区皇寺，二区石相等村，锄完苗开荒地，准备大量种菜、荞麦，以备荒年。五区东柏山已锄二遍苗，在全村八个组大竞赛下，三天半将全村所有苗一千余亩锄完，二百九十八个男女劳力省出工二百，一、二两区水地已下手锄三、四遍。（昌言）
