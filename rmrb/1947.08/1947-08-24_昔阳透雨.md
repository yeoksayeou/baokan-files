　　Xiyang Copious Rain
    [Reported from Xiyang by this newspaper] Due to the spring and summer drought, crop failure in seven-eighths of the county's villages is certain, and a severe famine has already been determined. The copious rain that fell on August 12th and 13th is a very favorable condition for remedying and overcoming this famine. County Magistrate Chen has especially called for each person to plant at least half a mu of autumn vegetables, and for villagers near the urban area to guarantee planting two fen per person. (Areas 1, 4, and 7 can still plant buckwheat, and this should be discussed with the masses according to local conditions.) All government agencies, organizations, public and private shops, cooperatives, schools, and all cadres and the masses should be mobilized to seize the opportunity and immediately take comprehensive and full action, rushing to plant day and night, seeking to live on bran and vegetables for half a year, and preparing to accumulate fertilizer for planting wheat, eliminate wasteland, increase grain production, and reduce the famine. After receiving the call, cadres are discussing the matter with the masses in people's schools to implement it. (Ziyou, Xin Ying)
