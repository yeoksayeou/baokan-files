    Xinhua News Agency, Northeast, 5th: In early July, soldiers of the Inner Mongolia Self-Defense Army marched south and coordinated with the Democratic Allied Army in the Fakú and Tieling areas to defeat the Third Division of the Chiang Kai-shek's puppet cavalry's First Army. They killed 120 enemies, including regimental commander Yang Jie, and captured 534, including regimental commander Li Kuangmin, Li Xianba, regimental deputy Bao Rongjiu, and colonel instructor. They also shot down an enemy plane in the Jianghe area west of Fakú. When the news arrived, the military and civilians of Inner Mongolia were greatly encouraged. The Inner Mongolia Communist Party Working Committee recently donated 10,000 yuan and sent a letter of condolence.
    Xinhua News Agency, Northeast, 5th: A certain Inner Mongolian cavalry unit in the Front Banner has now established a strong infantry force, which is a pioneering achievement in Inner Mongolia's military history. The unit learned profound lessons in a year of patriotic self-defense war and recognized that infantry is the main force for resolving battles. The unit's leaders then called on commanders and fighters of a certain unit to dismount their horses and put on their boots to form a well-manned and well-equipped elite infantry force. The unit recently launched a marching competition. During the long-distance march, the soldiers showed no signs of fatigue.
