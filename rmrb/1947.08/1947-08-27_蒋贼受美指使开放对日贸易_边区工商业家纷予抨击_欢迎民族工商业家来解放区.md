Xinhua News Agency, Jinji Luyu, August 25th: Industrialists and businessmen in the border region have strongly criticized Chiang Kai-shek's brazen opening of trade with Japan under the direction of U.S. imperialists. Hu Zhuxuan, chairman of the privately-owned Ruihua Bank in the border region, said: "This is a repeat of the tragic history of 'Sino-Japanese economic cooperation,' and a fatal blow to China's fragile national industry and commerce by U.S. imperialism following the 'Sino-American Commercial Treaty.' Goods bearing the Sun trademark will soon bring collapse, bankruptcy, unemployment, death, and other painful experiences to Chinese industry and commerce." Xu Daben, director of the Border Region Industry and Mining Bureau, Wang Xianzhou, general manager of Handan Yongxing Printing Company, and others stated: Trade with Japan is the concrete implementation of the U.S. imperialist conspiracy of "industrial Japan, agricultural China." Although industry and commerce in the liberated areas are still small, they are flourishing under the strong encouragement and support of the democratic government in recent years. The textile, paper-making, and coal and iron industries in the border region are advancing rapidly towards self-sufficiency. We should redouble our efforts to support the struggle of national industry and commerce in the Kuomintang-controlled areas. Unless we smash Chiang Kai-shek's traitorous rule and U.S. imperialist aggression, national industry in the Kuomintang-controlled areas will never have a chance to rise." Liu Daifeng, director of the Border Region Trade Bureau, said sadly: "In recent years, the endeavors of national industrialists and businessmen in the Kuomintang-controlled areas, operating with great difficulty, have been devastated by Chiang Kai-shek's traitorous policies and the dumping of American goods, and they are already on the verge of collapse. 'Opening trade with Japan' is like a harbinger of death." He continued, "Our border region has the full strength to resist the intrusion of American and Japanese goods. We must fully support all national industrialists and businessmen in the Kuomintang-controlled areas who are engaged in struggle, and welcome them to the liberated areas to operate and fight together, to smash this vicious conspiracy of the U.S. and Chiang."

Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, August 25th: Beijing news: The Chiang government is currently preparing to organize a huge trust to monopolize the salt industry in the three regions of Northeast China, North China, and Taiwan, to be named "China Salt Industry Co., Ltd.," with a capital of 100 billion yuan (Chiang currency), divided into 200,000 shares, of which "official shares" account for 100,000 shares, and "commercial promoters" account for 10,000 shares, completely controlled by bureaucratic capital. The entire share capital is scheduled to be fully subscribed by September 15th. The Four Big Families are rushing to organize a salt trust at this time in order to meet the larger-scale need for Chinese edible salt by Japanese industry after the "opening" of Sino-Japanese trade, and to seize the opportunity to reap huge profits.

Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, August 25th: According to a Central News Agency report from Haikou, Hainan Island, on the 23rd, "the salt transportation has completely stopped" due to the salt tax increase. The salt tax increase was passed by the Chiang government's "State Council" on the 15th, stipulating that the salt tax be increased to nine times the original amount, that is, 100,000 yuan per dan. This is one of the measures taken by Chiang Kai-shek to intensify the extortion of the people after issuing the counter-revolutionary "General Mobilization" order.

　　蒋贼受美指使开放对日贸易
  　边区工商业家纷予抨击           
    欢迎民族工商业家来解放区
    【新华社晋冀鲁豫二十五日电】边区工商界人士对蒋介石在美帝国主义者指使下，悍然开放对日贸易，纷纷加以抨击。边区民营瑞华银行董事长胡竹轩称：“这是‘中日经济提携’惨史的重演，是美帝国主义继‘中美商约’后给中国脆弱的民族工商业的致命一击。太阳商标的商品，即将带给中国工商业以倒闭、破产、失业、死亡等惨痛。”边区工矿局局长徐达本、邯郸永兴印刷公司总经理王显周等表示：对日贸易是美帝国主义“工业日本、农业中国”阴谋的具体实施，解放区的工商业现在虽很幼小，但几年来在民主政府大力奖励扶植下，正欣欣向荣。边区之纺织、造纸、煤铁业正一日千里，走向自给之路。我们应加倍努力，支援蒋管区民族工商业的斗争，不打碎蒋介石的卖国统治和美帝国主义的侵略，蒋管区民族工业永无抬头之日。边区贸易局局长刘岱峰很沉痛的说：“近几年来蒋管区民族工商业家惨淡经营的事业，在蒋贼卖国政策及美货倾销下受尽摧残，本已奄奄一息，‘开放对日贸易’等于来了个催命鬼。”接着他说：“我们边区完全有力量抵御美日商品侵入，我们更要全力声援蒋管区一切正在进行斗争的民族工商业家，欢迎他们到解放区来共同经营，共同奋斗，粉碎美蒋这一狠毒阴谋。”
    【新华社陕北二十五日电】北平消息：蒋政府刻正筹组垄断东北、华北、台湾三区盐业的庞大托辣斯，定名为“中国盐业股份有限公司”，资本额一千亿元（蒋币），分为二十万股，其中“官股”占十万股，“商股发起人”占一万股，完全系官僚资本所掌握。全部股本定于九月十五日招收完毕。众信四大家族在此时急急筹组盐业托辣斯，是为了适应“开放”中日贸易后日本工业对中国食盐更大规模的需要，趁机博取厚利。
    【新华社陕北二十五日电】据中央社二十三日自海南岛海口报导，由于食盐增税，“已使盐运完全停止”。按食盐增税系蒋政府“国务会议”十五日过者，规定增加盐税至原额九倍，即每担十万元，此为蒋介石颁布反革命“总动员”令加紧勒索人民的措施之一。
