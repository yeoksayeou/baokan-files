Several Experiences in Launching a Mass Movement to Commend Merits and Model Workers
Taihang Third Special District Office

(I)
Based on the commendation of merits and model workers by the masses in Hukou Town, Changzhi First District, we have gained the following experiences in grasping and leading the movement, which are briefly introduced for reference by various regions.
Regarding the movement to commend merits and model workers of the new heroism, the leadership must first have a clear understanding ideologically: First, everyone is willing to say good things and unwilling to say bad things, so the masses' ideas of making contributions, being models, being heroes, and loving honor are the active factors in the mass movement to commend merits and model workers. Therefore, the spirit of commending merits and model workers and the attitude towards the masses must also be: "Only say good things, not bad things; only praise, not criticize." Only in this way can we greatly promote the active factors of the masses, overcome shortcomings and all ideological obstacles, to promote the work. Second, the masses are influenced by the old society, and there are many ideological obstacles (such as, "The army has merit, how can we have merit?" or "Wanting to report merit, but being embarrassed..." etc.). If these ideological obstacles are not broken through, the movement to commend merits and model workers will be difficult to launch. Therefore, how to promote the active factors of the masses and eliminate these ideological obstacles requires a certain process.

(II)
Because the commendation of merits and model workers has no foundation in the countryside, the masses' understanding of commending merits and model workers is extremely inconsistent at the beginning, coupled with various ideological concerns and obstacles. Therefore, if we do not boldly let go, it will be difficult to eliminate these ideological obstacles, and the movement will not be able to develop rapidly. However, when we boldly let go, the masses will talk endlessly like the Yellow River breaching its banks, because the masses' ideological emotions are different, and the form and content of the talks are also very inconsistent. For example, after Hukou Town boldly let go, some people complained, some reviewed mutual assistance, some felt that they had no merit, and some were embarrassed to talk about their merits. In short, in various forms, it was rare for someone to report their merits in the first meeting. From the form, it seems that the masses are unwilling to make contributions or be heroes, but this is not the case. This is precisely when the active factors are rising and the ideological obstacles are decreasing. Therefore, at this time, we should not think that this is "bad", but we should think that this is "getting better soon." When the masses talk about whatever they want, the leadership should be good at identifying which are the active factors and which are the negative obstacles from the masses' talks, and should seize the active factors and give praise, even if it is the smallest point, it should be said "good". Only in this way can the masses gradually clarify "what their merits are" ideologically, and further improve the enthusiasm of the masses. Only in this way can the merit reporting movement be boosted step by step, layer by layer, from not talking to talking, from complaining to reporting merit, from small merit to big merit, from one point to several points.
For example, in a merit reporting group in Hukou Town, at the beginning, an activist came straight to the point and said: "Whoever has merit, report it!" As a result, one said, "I have no merit!", and another said, "I also have no merit!" After a long time, no one had any merit. Later, the method of boldly letting go, saying whatever you want, and using the issue of diverting water as a starting point was adopted, and the merit reporting movement began to unfold. For example, after Wang Gengsheng returned from transportation, he was anxious that the seedlings were not weeded, so he privately went to the fields early in the morning and weeded two acres of millet and fertilized two acres of corn. Therefore, someone in the mutual aid group criticized him for being selfish, and he became sullen. So he complained at the meeting: "Is weeding and fertilizing corn called selfish, and leaving it unweeded not called selfish?!" As a result, everyone said: "Weeding is better than not weeding, fertilizing is better than not fertilizing, this is not selfish, this is active in production!", With words and praise, Wang Gengsheng was happy. Then Wang Gengsheng talked about his achievements in transportation, which aroused everyone to talk about it.

(III)
After the mass merit reporting movement is launched, the movement of comparing merits and evaluating merits should be launched to improve the movement a step further. This is the demand of the masses and also an important link that we should grasp. For example, after the merit reporting movement was launched in Hukou Town, many disputes over merit occurred. One said, "He is good", and another said, "He is also good", even loafers squeezed in to compete. Finally, everyone proposed: "Merit is not in empty talk, but to distinguish between high and low, and compete in the training ground!". As a result, after comparing and evaluating merits, those with merit were happy, and those without merit were not discouraged.

(IV)
The difference between the mass commendation of merits and model workers and the organs and troops is that the reporting, commending, and evaluating of merits are done in a "one-pot" manner, but each stage has its own main trend; in addition, the form of commendation is also different from that of the organs and troops. At the commendation meeting, those with small merits only receive applause, while those with great merits, in addition to applause, also receive some "supplements", or a "good" is called, or even the "good" is emphasized with a "more", saying "better". For example, after Zhang Xigui reported his merits in Hukou Town, he only received applause. In addition to applause, Wang Gengsheng also added a supplement and called it good, while Cui Wenyin was praised for his good mutual assistance, especially for his good work in drought resistance and famine preparation, so he was applauded and supplemented, and it was proposed to add a "more", saying "better".

(V)
After evaluating the merits, a congratulatory ceremony should be organized. Through the congratulatory ceremony, the achievements of the commendation should be consolidated and improved, the relationship between the meritorious heroes and the masses should be close, the ideological awareness of the masses should be improved, the meritorious heroes and the masses should clarify the direction of "adding merit to merit" and "establishing merit without merit", and in conjunction with the current work, cadres and the masses should be mobilized to formulate merit plans, and further launch a merit-making movement again to enrich the content of the commendation of merits and model workers. If this is done in rotation, the commendation of merits and model workers will become a regular system. For example, when the masses in Hukou Town congratulated the meritorious, they proposed: "It is not enough to be happy, we must also take a breath." Therefore, they combined production and conservation, drought resistance and famine relief, and issued a call, and the heroic masses formulated merit plans and launched a merit-making movement for production and conservation, drought resistance and famine relief.

    开展群众表功表模运动的几点经验
    太行三专署
    （一）
    根据长治一区壶口镇群众的表功表模，在运动的掌握与领导上，取得以下几点经验、略作介绍，以供各地参考。
    关于新英雄主义的表功表模运动，首先要求领导思想上明确认识：一、人人都愿说好不愿说坏，所以群众立功劳，当模范，当英雄，爱荣誉的思想，就是群众表功表模中的积极因素。因此，表功表模的精神和对群众的态度，亦必须是：“只说好，不说坏，只表扬，不批评”。只有如此，才能大大发扬群众的积极因素，克服缺点和一切思想障碍，以推动工作。二、群众因受旧社会熏染，思想上存在着不少障碍（如军队有功，我们还能有功？或者是想报功，又不好意思……等等），这些思想障碍，如不突破，表功表模运动，即很难展开。因而，如何发扬群众的积极因素，清除这些思想障碍，还要经过一定的过程。
   （二）
    因为表功表模在农村里尚无基础，所以开始群众都表功表模的认识极不一致，加以各种思想顾虑与障碍。因此，我们如不大胆放手，就不易消除这些思想障碍，而运动亦不可能迅速开展，但是当我们大胆放手以后，群众就会象黄河决口一样，滔滔不绝的谈起来，因为群众的思想情绪不同，谈话的形式内容亦极不一致。如壶口镇在大胆放手以后，有的是发牢骚，有的是检讨互助，还有的认为自己没功，亦有的有功不好意思谈，总之形形色色，很少一开会，即跑出一个报功的来。从形式上看，群众似乎都不愿立功，不愿当英雄，其实不然，这正是积极因素抬头，思想障碍下降的时候。因此，我们在这时，不应当认为这是“坏了”，而应当认为这是“快好了”。群众有啥谈啥的时候，领导上即应善于从群众的谈话中，识别那些是积极的因素，那些是消极的障碍，并应抓住积极因素，予以表扬，那怕是最小的一点，亦应当说“好”。只有这样，才能使群众从思想上，逐步明确“自己那些功”，并进一步提高群众的积极性。也只有如此，才能使报功运动，由不谈到谈，由牢骚到报功，由小功谈到大功，由一点谈到数点，一步步一层层的轰起来。
    如壶口镇一个报功小组，一开始，积极分子劈头即来了个：“谁有功谁报！”结果闹的这个说：“我没功！”，那个说：“我亦没功！”闹了半天，谁亦没功。后来采取大胆放手，有啥说啥圪扯引水的办法，报功运动便展开了。如王根胜搞运输回来，苗子没锄完着了急，便私自到地里起早搭黑锄了二亩谷，奶了二亩玉茭。因此互助组内有人批评他自私自利，他便生了闷气。所以他于会上大发牢骚说：“锄地奶玉茭叫自私自利，荒了就不叫自私自利了？！”结果大家说：“锄了比不锄强，奶了比不奶强，这不是自私自利，这是生产积极！”，这样连说带表扬，王根胜便高兴了。接着王根胜便又谈出了他搞运输的功绩，于是引起大家都谈开了。
    （三）
    当群众报功运动展开后，应展开比功与评功运动，把运动提高一步。这是群众要求，亦是我们应当掌握的一个重要环节。如壶口镇当报功运动开展后，即发生不少争功纠纷，这个说：“他好”，那个说“他亦好”，甚至连二流子亦挤进去争。最后大家提出：“功不在空讲，要分高低，比武下教场！”。结果经过比功评功以后，有功的人高兴，没功的人亦不泄气。
    （四）
    群众性的表功表模和机关部队不同的地方，即是报功、表功、评功，采取了一锅煮的办法，不过每个阶段，亦有其一定的主潮；另外表功的形式上，亦和机关部队不同。在表功会议上，功小者，只来一番鼓掌，功大者，除鼓掌以外，还来些“补充”，或着是叫个“好”，甚至“好”字上强调提出加上个“更”字，说是“更好”。如壶口镇张喜贵报功以后，只来了一番鼓掌，王根胜除鼓掌外，还来了一番补充叫了个好，而崔文印因互助好，特别是抗旱备荒搞的好，所以连鼓掌带补充，还提出加个更字，说是“更好”。
    （五）
    经过评功即应组织贺功，经过贺功，巩固与提高表功成果，密切功臣英雄与群众的关系，提高群众的思想觉悟，使功臣与群众，明确“功上加功”“没功立功”的方向，并结合当前工作，发动干部群众，订立功计划，进一步再次展开立功运动，充实表功表模范运动内容，如是轮番下去，把表功表模运动成为经常制度。如壶口镇群众在贺功时，便又提出：“光高兴不行，还必须接住气。因而便又结合了生产节约、抗旱渡荒，作了号召，英雄群众便又订立了立功计划，展开了生产节约抗旱渡荒的立功运动。
