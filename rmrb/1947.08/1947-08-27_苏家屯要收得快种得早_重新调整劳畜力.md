[Reported by this newspaper from Xingtai] Sujiatun in the Second District has set a plan for autumn harvest and planting. The village has a total of 115 households, 21 mutual aid teams, 183 full and semi-laborers, and 26 livestock. Manpower and animal power have been reorganized. Two mutual aid teams combine into one group for work. Starting now, they will seize the time to rush to harvest millet, sorghum, corn, etc. Before the first day of the eighth month of the lunar calendar, the remaining 150 mu of wheat fields will be completely planted. During the discussion of the harvest and planting plan, Su Ren, the chairman of the farmers' association, said, "I think we should harvest whoever's crops ripen early first. When planting, the livestock should not haul manure or grind. We have organized 102 women and children into 17 groups, each with six people, to form a mutual aid team for pushing millstones. Male laborers haul manure. Because the cattle are used too much, except for plowing, they will generally not be used for anything else. When harvesting beans, we must pull them all up, not cut them. Cutting them doesn't clean the ground and it's hard to plow and plant. Now that firewood is scarce, pulling them also provides firewood and cleans the ground. Pulling beans must start before dawn. Once the sun gets hot, the bean pods prick your hands. Get up before dawn and by the time you rest, each person can pull one mu. After the autumn harvest, plant quickly." Chen Lu said, "If it rains in the 'fu' period, plant more wheat; if it doesn't rain in the 'fu' period, plant more vegetables!" This year there was heavy rain in the 'fu' period, and the harvest next year will definitely be good. Everyone knows 'planting one day earlier makes a big difference,' so why don't we plant faster! The entire village participates in mutual aid cultivation of 1,214.2 mu of land. Except for 200 mu reserved for seeds and flowers, all 1,014.2 mu must be planted!" Production Committee member Liu En proposed: Among them, there are seven households of orphans and widows, with 25 mu of land, lacking labor and unable to harvest or plant. The small group discussion resulted in the small group taking turns dispatching labor to harvest and plant for the orphans and widows. Village chief Su Baoshen said, "One wheat harvest is worth three autumn harvests!" This year's autumn equinox is on the tenth day of the eighth lunar month. As the saying goes: 'Wheat enters the soil at the autumn equinox,' so our village must complete all planting by the twentieth day of the eighth month. The crowd at the meeting responded loudly: "Yes! No one can fall behind by the twentieth, we must finish planting!" (Jin Xiang)

　　苏家屯要收得快种得早
  　重新调整劳畜力
    【本报邢台讯】二区苏家屯订出秋收秋种计划，全村共计一百一十五户，二十一个互助组，男女全半劳力一百八十三人，牲口二十六头。人力畜力重新组织，互助组两组合一组做活，由现在起，抓紧时间，抢收谷、高粱、玉茭等。在古历八月一日前，把所留的麦地一百五十亩，完全种上。讨论收种计划时，农会主席苏仁说：“我看谁庄稼熟的早，就先收谁的，种地时牲口不拉粪，不碾磨，组织了妇女儿童一百零二人，分十七组，每组六人，为推碾磨互助组，男劳力推粪，因牛使用太大，除犁地外，概不做别的使。秋收豆子通要拔，不用割，割的地不净，不好犁种，现在烧柴困难，拔的又有柴烧，地也干净；拔豆非起五更不行，天一热豆角扎手。不等天明就起来干，到歇时每人就能拔一亩，收了秋就赶紧种。”陈禄说：“伏里有雨多种麦，伏里没雨多种菜！”今年伏里有大雨，过年收成一定好，谁不知道“早种一天一个样”，咱为啥不快些种呢！全村参加互助土地一千二百一十四亩二分，除留种花地二百亩外，一千零一十四亩二分通要种上！生产委员刘恩提出：其中有孤寡七户，有二十五亩地，缺乏劳力没法收种。小组讨论结果，小组轮流抽调劳力给孤寡收种。村长苏保身说：“一麦顶三秋哩！”今年八月初十秋分，俗话说：秋分麦入土，至八月二十咱村一概要种完。会场群众一片响声：“对！到二十谁也不能落后，一定要种完！”（晋乡）
