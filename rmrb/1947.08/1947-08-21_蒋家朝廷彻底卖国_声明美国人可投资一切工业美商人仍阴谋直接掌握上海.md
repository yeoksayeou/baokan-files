Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 19th—Chiang Kai-shek's Premier Zhang Qun's formal statement on the 13th regarding "Foreign Investment and Technical Cooperation in China" (Note: At the end of last month, the Associated Press reported part of the statement) indicates that Chiang Kai-shek's traitorous government is striving to thoroughly adapt China's economy to the interests of American imperialism. In his statement, Zhang Qun included almost all of China's important industrial sectors within the scope of "cooperation" with American capital and technology. Zhang Qun said: Industries such as large-scale power machinery, machine tools, automobiles, locomotives, airplanes, and larger ships "can be directly invested in by foreign merchants." "State-owned" (i.e., operated by the four major families of bureaucratic capital) mining industries can also be "jointly operated with foreigners." Large-scale oil mines, steel plants, and air transport businesses can also "cooperate with foreign capital," and he reiterated that the Chiang-American traitorous "commercial treaty" stipulates that foreign capital operating in China will receive "the same treatment as domestic private enterprises in terms of rights and obligations." According to a United Press dispatch from Shanghai on the 16th, American businessmen welcome but are not satisfied with this approach. They are now brewing demands to designate Shanghai, China's largest international trade center, as an international "free city" so that they can directly control Shanghai in terms of trade. They openly say: "It would be good if we could control the national conditions ourselves." United Press said that these American businessmen are eager to restore the extraterritorial rights that once existed in China. Chiang's government officials dare not flatly deny the American request to designate Shanghai as a "free city," only vaguely saying: "It may be possible in the future, but not at present."

　　蒋家朝廷彻底卖国
    声明美国人可投资一切工业美商人仍阴谋直接掌握上海
    【新华社陕北十九日电】国民党行政院长张群十三日关于“外人来华投资及技术合作”的正式声明（按：上月底美联社曾传出该声明部分内容），表示蒋介石卖国政府正尽力使中国经济彻底适应美国帝国主义的利益。张群在他的声明中，几乎将中国一切重要工业部门都列入与美国资本及技术“合作”的范围。张群说：如象大型动力机、工具机、汽车、机车、飞机及较大轮船等项工业，“可由外商直接投资”，“国营”（即四大家族官僚资本经营）之矿业，亦可“与外人合资经营”，大规模石油矿、钢铁厂及空运事业等，亦可“与外资合作”，并重申蒋美卖国“商约”中所规定了的外资在华营业“与同类民营事业之权利义务同一待遇。”据合众社上海十六日消息，美国商人欢迎、但尚不满足于此项办法，他们现正酝酿着要求将中国最大国际贸易中心上海划为国际“自由市”，以便在贸易上将上海直接掌握于美国人之手。他们公开说：“能把国情操在我们自己手中就好了”。合众社说，这些美国商人渴望将过去存在于中国的治外法权，即予恢复。蒋政府官员对于美人要求划上海为“自由市”一节，不敢断言否认，仅含糊地说：日后可能，但目前不会”。
