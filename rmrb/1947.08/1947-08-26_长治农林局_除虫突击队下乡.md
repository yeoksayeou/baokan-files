  　Insect Extermination Task Force to the Countryside
    [This newspaper Changzhi News] Due to continuous days of autumn rain, cotton crops have also suffered from oil drought. The Third Special District reported: "A urgent telegram came from the PingShun County government stating that recently 6,000 mu of cotton fields across the county have been affected by oil drought, requesting measures to be taken for eradication." Upon receiving the news, the Changzhi Central Agricultural and Forestry Bureau immediately organized six extension workers and eight newly recruited students from the Agricultural and Forestry Vocational School, totaling fourteen people, to form an insect extermination task force. Equipped with fourteen large sprayers, ten barrels of "Emperor Brand" emulsion, a special aphicide (each barrel containing five dou, enough to treat eighty mu of oil drought-affected land, totaling eight hundred mu), fourteen packages of Dithis, and five jin of the new Agricultural and Forestry Bureau-produced tar soap aphicide, they rushed to eradicate the pests on the 18th of this month. A plan was also made to assist the county in organizing the masses to use indigenous methods for pest control on a large scale. Everyone's morale is high. For the new students at the Agricultural and Forestry Vocational School, their first lesson is to eradicate pests for the masses.
