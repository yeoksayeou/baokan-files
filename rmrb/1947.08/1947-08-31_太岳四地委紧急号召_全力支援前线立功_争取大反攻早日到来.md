　　Fully Support the Frontline to Achieve Meritorious Service
　　Strive for the Early Arrival of the Great Counter-Offensive
　　[This newspaper Taiyue Twenty-ninth dispatch] The Taiyue Fourth Prefectural Committee of the Chinese Communist Party issued an urgent call on August 15th to fully support the frontline and launch a meritorious service campaign. The call began by stating: "In order to assist the People's Liberation Army in striving for the early arrival of the great counter-offensive, we hereby call on the 1.1 million peasants and all Communist Party members in the entire region to mobilize with a hundredfold effort and fully support the frontline, launching meritorious service campaigns in all aspects." It then demanded: (1) All commanders and fighters of the frontline assault teams and militia rotation teams should universally launch a kill-the-enemy meritorious service competition. In border struggles, they must adhere to independent and autonomous guerrilla warfare, and frequently and proactively annihilate small groups of enemies. In newly recovered areas, they must protect land reform, protect the fruits of the peasants' liberation, destroy the counter-revolutionary regime controlled by landlords, gentry, special agents, and local bullies, and resolutely suppress resistance. It also called for learning from heroes like Wang Yulan (沁源), Xue Pinghua (济源), Zhao, Li Lin (垣曲), etc. (2) Battlefield stretcher teams, transportation teams, and conscripted militia teams must complete various combat support services urgently, quickly, happily, and appropriately, and launch the "Four Loves and Four Protections Movement", earnestly achieving: love the team, love the wounded and sick soldiers, love military supplies, and love the interests of the masses. Ensure no desertion, no straggling, no shirking; ensure timely rescue of battlefield casualties and rapid transportation to the rear for treatment; ensure timely completion of transportation tasks and delivery to designated locations; ensure armed escort and protection of supply security. It called on all participating masses to learn from the meritorious service models such as Zhang Li (阳城), Shi Yuanzhen (济源), Liu Dahan (高平), and Yanmen (晋城). (3) Staff members in the rear areas and villages, members of workers', peasants', and women's associations, guard militia, and self-defense team members must intensify production, economize, and prepare for famine, launch a campaign of preferential treatment for military families and cultivation on their behalf, and support the frontline. First, all able-bodied and semi-able-bodied laborers must be fully organized to cultivate on behalf of military cadres' families, revolutionary martyrs' families, and participating masses who lack labor, ensuring no land is left uncultivated, no reduction in yields, a large-scale replanting of autumn vegetables and buckwheat, and making every effort to expand wheat fields, universally eliminate cultivated wasteland, and compensate for losses from drought and hail disasters, striving for a harvest of 50% to 70% of normal. In addition, all young and middle-aged people must make sufficient mental preparations so that they can continuously support the frontline when necessary, universally achieving participation in combat without hindering production, and production without hindering participation in combat. (4) All staff members in rear area organs must fully utilize their initiative and creativity in various tasks, improve work methods, universally promote business mutual assistance, and launch a mutual assistance meritorious service campaign. (5) County and sub-county committee comrades, and Communist Party members going to participate in combat, must establish Party branches and mobile groups in various participating organizations, ensuring that the Party can exert its vanguard and backbone role in any difficult and emergency situation, fully utilize their talents in their respective positions, lead the masses to advance bravely, overcome difficulties, and complete tasks.
