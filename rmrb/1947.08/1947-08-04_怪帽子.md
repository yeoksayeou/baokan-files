    Strange Hats
    Zheng Zhi
    (Excerpt from the "Dagongbao Garden" of Tianjin, June 15th)
    In this great era of the twentieth century,
    Everything is strange and every object bizarre.
    Buying hats doesn't cost you a penny,
    They fly wildly in the sky, looking for someone to wear them.
    Write an article, and they put one on you,
    Say a few words, and they put one on you,
    Beg for food, and they put one on you,
    Want democracy, and they put one on you.
    The shape of the hat is unseen,
    But the hat's power is like a sword.
    If it is worn on your honorable head,
    I guarantee you'll fall head over heels, old brother.
    What kind of strange hat is this?
    Please guess carefully,
    But don't shout it out loud when you guess it,
    Be careful the hat doesn't fall from the sky.

    怪帽子

    （摘自六月十五日天津大公报“大公园地”）
    二十世纪大时代，
    事事希奇物物怪。
    买帽不用君花钱，
    满天乱飞找人戴。
    写文章戴你一顶，
    多说话戴你一顶，
    要饭吃戴你一顶，
    想民主戴你一顶。
    帽子样子看不见，
    帽子厉害似刀剑。
    要是戴上尊脑袋，
    保管老兄跟头栽。
    这是啥子怪帽子？
    请君仔细猜一猜，
    猜到不要大声叫，
    紧防帽子由天掉。
