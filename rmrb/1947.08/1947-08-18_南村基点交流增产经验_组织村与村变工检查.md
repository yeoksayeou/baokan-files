　　Nancun Base Point Exchanges Experience in Increasing Production
　　Organizes Village-to-Village Labor Exchange Inspections
　　[Our newspaper, Licheng News] In order to promote increased production, the Nancun base point in the first district organized mutual inspections between villages. Furthermore, in order not to waste a single laborer, it organized village-to-village labor exchange inspections. That is, based on the specific situation of each village, each village inspected three mutual aid teams (advanced, average, and backward). Each team sent one representative, plus two cadres, for a total of five people, each bringing a hoe. They went to the village being inspected early in the morning and still participated in those three teams. In this way, everyone could still work according to their assigned tasks and exchange experiences from actual practice. For example, in Saili Village, while working in the fields and visiting the group, they learned about Nancun's method of calculating work based on land area (small-scale contracting) and the specific methods of combining war support with production. Labor hero Yuan Laohu from Nancun educated them on the technique of "hitting flower tops" (a weeding technique) in Saili Village. Li Zhuang Village inspected Chengnan's special consideration for military dependents, cadres' families, widows, widowers, orphans, and the childless in mutual assistance and equivalent value. Military dependents received two jin less than the general wage, and cadres' families, widows, widowers, orphans, and the childless received one jin less than the general wage. Through labor exchange inspections, each village learned from each other's strengths and compensated for their weaknesses, and received benefits. They are now launching a concentrated effort to weed the seedlings. (Reporters: Song, Lanting, Qingtang, Naitang)
　　[Our newspaper, Pingshun News] Xingcheng Village organized a large-scale inspection to promote increased production. The inspection revealed that 14 mu of wasteland in the village had not been hoed, many fields had not been hoed three times, no topdressing fertilizer had been applied, and there was some favoritism in mutual assistance that resulted in unequal pay, and some work points were not issued in a timely manner. After the inspection, the slogans of hoeing three times, applying topdressing fertilizer, and eliminating wasteland were put forward. The wages were also lowered, and mutual assistance was rectified, and the plan was completed in five days. After completion, a second inspection plan was drawn up to further improve production. The following problems were also discovered during the inspection: (1) The crops were generally planted too densely and were not carefully cultivated. For example, Wu Xiaonong planted one mu of buckwheat with more than 200 plants in one spot, and at least more than 100 in one spot. Only Yang Laiming's land was well cultivated, such as the millet on the east bank of the pond, with three seedlings in one spot, large ears and strong seedlings. (2) There were more than five mu (28 plots) of small wastelands in the mountain depressions. (3) More than 11 mu had not been topdressed with manure. (4) Except for the 56 mu of river silt land that really could not be hoed, it was found that Yu Sunzhao's two mu of edging land (the edge of the land was hoed, but the middle of the land was still hoed only twice) hadn't received three hoeings. (5) The land of military dependents and cadres' families was mostly poorly cultivated because they were issued work points for substitute cultivation, and they did it themselves to save work points and ultimately get rice, so the work was not careful enough. After two such comprehensive and detailed inspections, the masses mostly said: We must cultivate it well. Xiao Ben said: "We don't cultivate the land carefully, we don't separate the seedlings when hoeing millet, and we keep the seedlings when we see them. Our villagers go to Hei Hu for busy work, and people don't want us. This technique must be changed." The civil affairs director said: "Don't say that people inspect and say it, just let us think about it ourselves. It's a case of forgetting hunger after a full meal, and arable land is left barren." Most of the masses realized that the inspection was for their own good. A small number of lands were not completed on time, and under everyone's discussion and supervision, they were also completed quickly. After the inspection, each team quickly drew up a plan, and the wasteland was all completed by the 7th. The fourth team also proposed to complete the task early and help the third team to resolutely complete the task. (Wang Yuan, Wen Jie, Jian Jie)

　　南村基点交流增产经验
  　组织村与村变工检查
    【本报黎城讯】一区南村基点，为推动增产，组织各村互相检查，又为了不浪费一个劳力，组织村与村变工检查。即根据各村具体情况，每村检查三个互助组（先进、一般、落后），三组各出席一人，干部二人，共五人各带锄一张，一早到被检查村，仍参加该三个组，这样每个人均能依旧按活计工，并从实际中交流经验。如赛里村在地做活，访问组内的情况，学习了南村按地计工（小包工），战勤结合具体办法。南村劳动英雄原老虎，在赛里村教育他们打花顶的技术。李庄村检查城南在互助等价上，特别照顾军干属鳏寡孤独，军属比一般工资低二斤，干属鳏寡孤独比一般低一斤。通过变工检查，各村都择长补短，得到好处，现正突击锄苗。（记松、兰廷、庆堂、乃堂）
    【本报平顺讯】杏城村为推动增产组织大检查，查出全村有十四亩荒地未锄，不少地没锄三遍，没上追肥，在互助上有些讲情面不等价，有些工票没及时开。检查后提出锄三遍、上追肥、灭荒地口号。又降低工资整顿了互助，五天即完成了计划。完成后又订出二次检查计划再进一步提高生产，检查中又发现以下问题：（一）庄稼普遍留稠，做造不细，如武小弄种的一亩鞑靼谷，一安就有二百多棵，少的也有一百多。全村只有杨来明做造的地好，如池东岸谷，一步三安穗大苗肥。（二）山头凹沟小块荒还有五亩多（廿八块）。（三）没上追粪的十一亩多。（四）没上三锄的，除五十六亩河淤地真正不能过锄外，发现于孙赵与二亩镶边地（地边锄了地当中还是二遍）。（五）军属干属的地，大部做造的不好，原因是发给他们代耕工票，他自己做省下工票，最后得米，做的不够细。经这样两次普遍细致检查后，群众大部都说：可得好好做造哩。小奔说：“咱做造地不细致，咱锄谷不分安，见苗就留，咱村人到黑虎打忙工，人家就不要，这技术可得改哩。”民事主任说：“不用说人家检查说呀，就叫咱自己想想也是一饱忘了百饥，能犁的平地就叫荒啦。”大部分群众都认识了检查是为了自己，有少数地没按时完成，在大家议论督促下，也加紧完成，检查后各队很快订出计划，七号荒地全部完成，四大队并提出早完成帮助三大队坚决完成任务。（王元、文杰、建杰）
