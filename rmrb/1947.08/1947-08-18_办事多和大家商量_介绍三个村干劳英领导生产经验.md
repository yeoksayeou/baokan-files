　　Discuss Matters with the Masses
　　Introducing the Production Experience of Three Village Cadre Labor Heroes
　　Li Zhuang
　　(I)
　　After a short period of rural interviews, I deeply felt that leading farmers with different ideas in the village to carry out large-scale production is indeed not an easy task. The activities of Peng Lian, the village chief of Shahe Ferry, Liu Qingyun, a labor hero, and Cao Laoshui, the village chief of Northeast Liu Village, answered questions such as "How do village cadres and labor heroes lead production?"

　　Peng Lian is a model cadre elected by the Second Congress of Heroes in the Taihang District, a poor peasant who stood up in 1944. Liu Qingyun is a labor hero elected by the Second Congress of Heroes in the Taihang District. His family was very poor, and he was promoted to a middle peasant during the Anti-Japanese War relying on the democratic government. Cao Laoshui is a veteran Red Army soldier under Liu Zhidan. He was wounded and discharged during the Anti-Japanese War and settled in Northeast Liu Village, where he worked as a hired laborer for many years. All three of them gave the masses in the village a feeling: "They are good people, and there is nothing wrong with listening to them." Their actions have gained the unlimited trust of the masses.

　　Recording some of their exemplary leadership methods, I think, would be beneficial.

　　(II)
　　All three are good at physical labor. When building revetments on the river beach in the ferry, Peng Lian and Liu Qingyun both picked up large stones and carried them. Liu Qingyun brought back a stone from the field every day, accumulated them, and built five houses. Cao Laoshui is over fifty years old, and he labors in the mutual aid group, surpassing any young person. The masses all said, "They are still so committed, what are we if we don't work hard!" When the government called for storing seeds and rushing to plant, Liu Qingyun took the lead in planting eight mu himself. Shortly after, it rained two fingers deep, and he rushed to plant another eight mu. After finishing, he discussed with everyone: "Is it right to do this?" After a long discussion, everyone said "Yes!" and went down to do the same.

　　In the spring, Liu Qingyun said to the people in the mutual aid group: "Our village's paddy fields are good, but there is not enough manure. The grain harvested is not as good as Peng Zhengsuo's dry land. We need to raise sheep to accumulate manure." He and Peng Zhengsuo each bought four first, and everyone went to buy them, increasing the number to one hundred and six at once.

　　Peng Lian eats poorly and dresses poorly, which is well-known in the village. When the government called for saving for famine preparedness, he used himself as an example and often promoted it to everyone. Liu Qingyun's current grain can last until May next year. When it was dry, he changed the dry rice to porridge and fried noodles. Four refugee households returned to the village from Shanxi without seeds, so he lent them one dan of grain. Liu Ergui, a neighbor, said: "You have grain but you don't eat it, you eat porridge. You are really strange." Qingyun used this opportunity to calculate accounts with everyone, and many people were shocked: "Our grain reserves are not as good as his, yet we are still eating like this!" Changing meals to save food became a trend for a time.

　　There are too many military dependents in Northeast Liu Village, making it difficult to cultivate on their behalf. Cao Laoshui (a bachelor) and two military dependents, three bachelors voluntarily formed a mutual aid group. The military dependents' women make clothes and cook for the bachelors, and the bachelors cultivate the land for them. The military dependents' lives are solved, and the village does not need to cultivate on their behalf. Other groups came to learn from them, and more than thirty military dependents in the village no longer need cultivation on their behalf.

　　★　　　　　　　　★　　　　　　　★
　　The enemy burned two-thirds of the houses in the ferry, and the masses generally demanded to build and repair houses. Without lime, Peng Lian said to everyone: "Let's open a lime kiln!" Everyone agreed. When the lime kiln was set up, not only were the houses repaired, but also a lot of money was earned.

　　The good paddy fields in the ferry were all distributed to military dependents. Irrigating the land with wells is very labor-intensive, and there are many military dependents, so they are too busy to cultivate on their behalf. After listening to the opinions of the masses, Peng Lian proposed to build a canal to change the well-irrigated land to water-irrigated land, saving a lot of irrigation time, and to build a water mill to free up the livestock grinding flour for farming. Everyone certainly agreed. The canal was built, but the water mill could not turn. The leader of the canal construction said to Peng Lian: "What face do I have to see anyone if it doesn't turn? I have already found the rope and the tree!" Peng said: "Don't be afraid! There is no water mill that doesn't turn, take it slow. Besides, even if it doesn't turn, we have done our best for everyone, it's nothing!" With encouragement and support, the water mill was finally built.

　　Liu Qingyun beat the drum every day to urge people to go to the fields, rain or shine, three years as one day. Some people who couldn't get up suddenly raised an objection: "The noise keeps people from sleeping, how can we work if we don't sleep well?" Qingyun conducted a self-criticism at a mass meeting: "I get up early, but some people can't get up, and I beat the drum no matter how early it is. I am still a bit subjective. What do you think, should I still beat the drum?" Everyone said "Beat it!". He then said: "Everyone agrees to beat it, but when?" Everyone decided to beat the drum when the eastern mountain turns red, which is at dawn.

　　This year, carrying water to plant, many people were not very enthusiastic, because it takes six workdays per mu, and one workday costs six jin of rice, which is expensive, and cotton is not guaranteed. Qingyun discussed with everyone again: "Let's set the wages for each workday at five jin, and try to exchange labor for labor. If we really have to pay with rice, we'll postpone it to May. Last year, we made a lot of money growing cotton. This year, there is a drought and less cotton, so the price will definitely rise. We have to plant it no matter what!" Everyone thought it made sense, and the whole village planted more than 500 mu.

　　★　　　　　　　　★　　　　　　　★
　　During the busy farming season, Peng Lian re-arranged the village work. One cadre is on duty every day, and the others go to the mutual aid group to produce. All problems are resolved within the group as much as possible, and there are fewer general meetings and cadre meetings. He himself participated in a mutual aid group and worked harder than everyone else. When he discovered a problem, he raised it at a small group meeting as a member of the group. When there was no meeting, he offered suggestions to the group leader and asked him to solve it. The group leader said: "Village chief, why don't you solve it?" Peng Lian said: "I don't know the situation in the group as well as you do. If I solve it, it will be a bureaucratic mess!" His group is one of the most united groups in the village.

　　★　　　　　　　　★　　　　　　　★
　　Finally, when distributing fruits, military dependents and the masses had disagreements, and they all wanted to get more. Peng Lian knew that if this problem was not solved well, it would affect production. He first spoke to the military dependents individually as a military dependent himself (his nephew joined the army): "Our family's people joined the army to protect everyone, and also to protect our fruits of liberation. We cannot demand special treatment!" He also went to explain to the masses: Military dependents are meritorious. Their children are bleeding and fighting on the front line, we must take care of them. Both sides understood and dispelled their anger. Finally, a joint meeting was held, and the contradictions between the two sides were quickly and thoroughly resolved. He himself did not receive any fruit.

　　Cao Laoshui knew that some middle peasants still had concerns about production and getting rich. He often spoke to them individually, explaining the policy of not struggling against middle peasants and allowing them to become richer. He told them: "If we are going to struggle against those who get rich through labor, why is the Communist Party still advocating thrift and hard work?" The middle peasants began to understand. He also helped them make plans, calculating that saving a bag of wheat can buy a large cart of manure, which can be applied to the land to produce several more bags of grain. He established a relationship with the middle peasants, and everyone trusted him. They repaired waterwheels, bought livestock, and worked hard, increasing the number of livestock by more than 20 in half a year.

　　(III)
　　These complex and skillful leadership methods, according to these model figures themselves, seem very ordinary and simple.

　　"Do what should be done first, make a model for everyone to see, and if there are benefits, everyone will come and do it."

　　"Do what everyone wants to do; if you want everyone to do something, don't rush, discuss it with him slowly first, and when the time is right, say it all at once."

　　"Ask everyone before doing things, discuss with everyone more, solve difficulties first, and don't just talk nonsense."

　　"Cadres cannot be special, help everyone more, and everyone will help you. Do good things to the end, don't be afraid."

　　"Talk it through first before holding a meeting, to avoid making things worse."

　　Indeed, these are simple principles, but they are not easy to do.

　　办事多和大家商量
  　介绍三个村干劳英领导生产经验
    李庄
  　（一）
    作了短期的乡村采访，深深感到在村里领导各种不同心思的农民进行大生产，实在是一件极不容易的事。沙河渡口村长彭连、劳动英雄刘清云和东北流村长曹老水的活动，答复了“村干劳英如何领导生产”等问题。
    彭连是太行区二届群英会选出的模范干部，贫农，四四年翻的身。刘清云是太行区二届群英会选出的劳动英雄，家里很穷，抗战中依靠民主政府升为中农。曹老水是刘志丹部下的老红军，抗战中负伤退伍，在东北流安了家，当过多年雇工。三个人都在村里给予群众一种感觉：“他们是好人，听他们的话没有错。”他们的所作所为，已取得群众无限的信任。
    纪录他们一些模范的领导方法，想来是有益的。
    （二）
    三个人都是好受家。渡口修垒河滩地，彭连、刘清云都拣着大石头扛。刘清云每天从地里捎回一块石头，积垒起来，盖了五间房。曹老水已五十多岁，在互助组中劳动，超过任何一个青年人。群众都说：“人家还这么实受，咱不干算啥！”政府号召寄种抢种，刘清云自己先干种了八亩，不久下了二指雨，自己又先抢种了八亩。作完了就和大家商量：“这样作对不对？”大家议论半天，都说“对！”下去都跟着干了。
    春天，刘清云对互助组的人说：“咱村水地不错，就是粪少，打的粮食还不如彭正锁的旱地，咱们要养羊积粪。”他和彭正锁每人先买了四只，大家都去买，一下增加到一百零六只。
    彭连吃的坏，穿的坏，在村里是有名的。政府号召节约备荒，他以自己作例子，常和大家宣传。刘清云现在的粮食可以吃到明年五月，天旱了又把干饭改成稀饭、炒面。村中从山西回来四户逃难的，没有种籽，他就借出一石谷。邻家刘二贵说：“放着粮食不吃，吃稀饭，你这个人真怪。”清云利用这个机会，和大家算帐，许多人大吃一惊：“咱们的存粮不如他，还这样瞎吃！”换饭节约，一时成为风气。
    东北流军属太多，代耕困难。曹老水（光棍）和两家军属，三个光棍自愿结合互助组。军属妇女给光棍汉作衣服作饭，光棍汉给她们种地。军属生活解决，不要村里代耕。其他组都来学习，全村已有三十多户军属不要代耕了。
    ★　　　　　　　　★　　　　　　　★
    敌人把渡口的房子烧了三分之二，群众普遍要求盖房修屋，没有石灰，彭连和大家说：“咱们开个灰窑吧！”都赞成。灰窑搞起，不但把房子修好了，还赚了许多钱。
    渡口的好水地，都分给了军属，井浇地很费工，军属又多，代耕忙不过来。彭连听了群众的意见，提议修条渠，把井浇地改为水浇地，省许多浇水时间，又可修一盘水磨，腾出磨面的牲口种地；大家当然赞成。渠修成了，水磨却打不转、领导修渠的对彭连说：“再打不转我还有什么脸见人？绳子树都找好了！”彭说：“不怕！水磨那有打不转的，慢慢来，再说万一打不转，咱们为大家尽到了心，也没啥！”又鼓励又撑腰，水磨终于修成了。
    刘清云每天不明就擂鼓催人上地，风雨无阻，三年如一日。有些起不来的人，忽然提出意见：“吵的人睡不着觉，睡不好觉怎么劳动。”清云在一次群众大会上自己检讨起来：“我起的早，有人起不来，不管多早就打鼓，还有些主观，大家看还打不打？”大家说“打！”。他又说：“大家都同意打，看什么时候？”大家决定在东山发了红，发红是拂晓的时候。
    今年担水点种，许多人劲头不大，原因是一亩地要用六个工，一个工六斤米，本钱既贵，棉花又不保险。清云又和大家商量：“把每工的工资，订为五斤，尽量工还工；非还米不行，就挪到五月。去年种花赚了大钱；今年天旱花少，一定涨钱，咱们怎么也得种！”大家听了很对，全村种了五百多亩。
    ★　　　　　　　　★　　　　　　　★
    在农忙的时候，彭连把村里工作重新安排一下，每天一个干部值日，其他都到互助组中生产，一切问题，尽量在组内解决，少开大会和干部会。他自己参加了一个互助组，劳动得比大家都起劲，发现有什么问题，开小组会时，以一个组员的资格提出；不开会时向组长贡献意见，请他解决。组长说：“村长你解决一下吧？”彭连说：“我不如你知道组里情况，我解决就是包办也包办不好！”他那个组，是全村团结最好的小组之一。
    ★　　　　　　　　★　　　　　　　★
    最后分果实时，军属和群众发生意见，都想多分些。彭连知道这个问题解决不好要影响生产，先以军属的资格（他的侄子参了军），和军属个别谈话：“咱家的人参了军，是保护大家，也是保护咱的翻身果实，咱不能要求特殊！”又去和群众解释：军属是有功的，人家的孩子在前方流血拼命，咱们要照顾。双方想通，都打消了火气，最后召开联席会，双方的矛盾很快就彻底解决了。他自己却未分任何果实。
    曹老水知道某些中农对生产发家还有顾虑，常和他们个别谈话，解释不斗中农、富上加富的政策。告诉他们：“对劳动发家的要斗争的话，共产党干什么还提倡省俭勤劳？”中农开始想通了。他又帮助他们订计划，计算省吃一袋麦子，就可买一大车大粪，上到地里，能多打几布袋粮食。他和中农建立了感情，大家信任他，修水车、买牲口，大干起来，半年就增加了二十多头牲口。
    （三）
    这些复杂而巧妙的领导方法，照这些模范人物自己说起来，又似乎非常的平常简单。
    “该干的自己先干，干出个样子大家看着，有好处就都来干了”。
    “大家想干啥你就干啥；想叫大家干啥，不能着急，先慢慢和他商量，看准火候，再一下说破。”
    “办事先问问众人，多和大家商量，有困难要先解决，可不能空口说白话。”
    “干部可不能特殊，多帮助大家，大家就会帮助自己，好事作到底，不用害怕。”
    “先说通了再开会，免得把事情弄僵。”
    真的，这是些简单的道理，作起来也不容易呢。
