Xinhua News Agency, Jin Sui, 27th. A reporter's dispatch from the Shenfu front in northern Shaanxi: With grief and indignation, I toured the area along the Great Wall bordering the outside of the pass in Shenmu County. During the ten years of the domestic revolutionary war, this was a paradise for the people, a Soviet area. During the Anti-Japanese War, Chiang's army took the opportunity to gradually encroach upon it, compressing the Eighth Route Army into a narrow strip along the Yellow River. But now the Eighth Route Army is back. When I passed through Gaojiabao, Gaojiawu and other important strongholds of Chiang's army that were captured by the Liberation Army, I saw desolation everywhere. The pillboxes of Chiang's army on the top of the mountains and the trenches connecting the pillboxes were overgrown with weeds. Flocks of sparrows startled into flight from time to time. Rows of scarecrows were kneeling on the training grounds near Chiang's army. All signs indicated that Chiang's army was weak and had been preparing to flee for a long time. The men in the villages all flocked to the front to support it voluntarily, while the women stayed at home to receive us. One woman, who was pulling the bellows to boil water for us, said: "Comrades, (she hasn't dared to say these two words for many years) fight well! My mother's family is now in the White Area (Chiang-occupied area). The bad people in the White Area call me a Red Army, and they won't let me go back. Even if my mother dies, they won't let me go back to see her!" One of the cadres accompanying us had led the land revolution here ten years ago. The masses were particularly affectionate to him. The woman who was pulling the bellows said excitedly how her brother had made revolution with our cadre, and how she had sewed and mended for the Red Army at that time. She said very affectionately: "Comrades! How long have you been gone! Has someone else been mending your clothes? You probably forgot about us!" Because of the ravages of Chiang's army, those girls who used to hide their braids in their collars and pretend to be married women are now pulling them out of their collars and becoming young girls again. Many people who had fled came back from the mountains to visit old friends they had been separated from for many years, bringing large piles of fresh fruit just picked from the trees. The courtyard was crowded with people, talking and laughing in a hubbub.

　　神府前线巡记
    【新华社晋绥二十七日电】陕北神府前线记者报导：记者怀着悲愤的情绪，巡行神木县邻接塞外的长城边沿区。在十前的国内战争时期，这里本是人民的乐园苏区，抗日战争期间，蒋军即乘机逐渐侵占，把八路军压缩在黄河沿岸的狭长地带，但是现在八路军又回来了。记者经过此次解放军攻克的蒋军重要据点高家堡、高家坞等地时，满目荒凉，山顶上蒋军的碉堡里和连接碉堡的交壕里，也野草丛出，时时成群的麻雀惊飞，成排的稻草人在邻近蒋军的操场上跪着，各种迹象，显示着蒋军兵力空虚早就准备好了跑。村里男人们都蜂拥的自动支援前线去了，妇们则留在家里接待我们，正在拉风箱给我们烧水的一个妇女说：“同志，（她是多少年不敢说这两个字了啊）好好打吧，我的娘家现在白区，归蒋占区）白区的坏人都叫我红军，不让我回去，就是我娘死去，也不让我回去看一看哩！”和我们同行的有一位干部十年前曾在这里领导过土地革命，群众对他特别亲热，那位拉风箱的妇女，兴奋的讲着她的哥哥怎样和我们这位干部一起闹革命，那时她怎样为红军缝缝补补，她非常亲切的说：“同志！你们走了多久啊！有别人给你们补衣服了，大概忘了我们吧！”因为蒋军的蹂躏，那些从前把辫子藏在衣领内装做妇人的姑娘们，现在都纷纷把它从衣领内拉出来，又变成了年轻的姑娘。许多逃出去的人们从山上赶回来，看望阔别多年的老朋友，送来了刚从树上摘来的大堆鲜果，院里挤满了人群，谈笑错杂，嚷成一片。
