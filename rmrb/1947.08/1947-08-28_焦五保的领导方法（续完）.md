　　Jiao Wubao's Leadership Method (Continued)
　　　　·Peng Bo·
　　　　Four. War-Education Combination Achieves New Development, New Soldiers Become Old Heroes

Jiao Wubao's combination of war and education involves treating the battlefield as a classroom and the training ground as a battlefield to lead new soldiers. Recently, Jiao Wubao has greatly expanded this method, which has promoted the development of new heroism and the movement to earn merit, becoming a powerful guarantee for victory in every battle. He is not only able to lead new soldiers who are afraid or unable to fight onto the battlefield, but also cultivates many combat models and heroes, such as Zhang Maimai.

Zhang Maimai joined Jiao Wubao's mutual aid group in the first month of this year. As a new soldier who had never traveled far, he naturally encountered many difficulties. He didn't understand military life, was unwilling to leave home, and certainly didn't know how to fight, so he was very uneasy about his work. Jiao Wubao first provided concrete assistance in terms of life and politics, resolving these difficulties, and often comforted him, saying, "This is our home. From now on, we will work together, eat together, and fight together. If you have any difficulties, tell me, and I will find a way to help you solve them." In this way, Jiao Wubao united him and changed his mood.

When Zhang Maimai first arrived, Jiao Wubao first taught him about the performance of weapons. After that, Jiao Wubao often led him to the training ground to learn the three major skills, or took him to the field to practice killing the enemy and utilizing terrain, combining the learning actions with his past combat experience. This war-education combination made Zhang feel that learning was very important and interesting. Even though his arms were swollen from practice, he didn't feel pain or fatigue. Once, during field practice, Jiao Wubao told him a battle story, explaining how he used this action in the past to eliminate the enemy and capture prisoners... Zhang Maimai was happy to hear this and said, "If fighting is like this, I'm sure I won't be a coward in battle."

During the second crossing of the river to the south, his company received the task of eliminating the enemy in Quwo. Before the battle, Jiao Wubao's group held a meeting to brainstorm solutions. Knowing that Zhang was a new soldier and must be afraid, he especially talked to him, telling him not to be afraid to keep up with the team, and advising him: "Don't shoot wildly from a distance, and make good use of the terrain." He also shared methods for avoiding bullets and artillery shells.

Before the troops even approached the enemy, the enemy was frantically firing from their fortifications towards the wide river beach, shouting "Capture them alive!" and "Charge!" Zhang Maimai had never experienced such a battle scene and was a little scared. Jiao Wubao immediately said, "Don't be afraid, the enemy is firing wildly and shouting mainly because they are afraid we will attack them." These words made Zhang feel enlightened, and he seemed to immediately gain a lot of courage. They rushed to the enemy's fortifications, and Jiao Wubao directed Zhang Maimai, Wang Zicai, and He Futu to throw grenades at the enemy's fortifications. Sure enough, a volley of grenades exploded in the enemy's position. Jiao Wubao then said, "Zhang Maimai, quickly run into the fortifications, they can't hit you!" Jiao Wubao, Wang Zicai, Zhang Maimai, and other comrades all ran into the fortifications without any problems. The enemy saw them enter the fortifications and were frightened and ran away. Jiao Wubao then led Zhang to pursue the enemy. During the pursuit, Zhang obtained a gun and captured an enemy soldier. In this first battle, Zhang Maimai was considered victorious. He happily said to Jiao Wubao, "Is fighting the Central Army like this?" Jiao Wubao smiled and said, "What did you think? The experience of fighting the Central Army is: don't shoot from a distance, don't shout when close. Make good use of the terrain, get close, throw a grenade, and then charge, and the enemy is sure to surrender." Zhang recalled the scene of the battle last night, and it was just like that. Only then did Zhang feel confident about fighting in the future.

In the Battle of Quwo, he behaved most bravely, being the first to rush into the courtyard during the street fighting, capturing three machine guns and dozens of prisoners. Later, he performed well again in the battles of Xiangning and Xiangling. In this way, the new soldier Zhang Maimai learned Jiao Wubao's set of tactics and became an old hero who won successive victories. (The End)

　　焦五保的领导方法（续完）
    ·彭勃·
    　　　　四、战教结合新发展新战士变成老英雄
    焦五保的战教结合，就是把战场当作课堂，把操场当作战场，来带领新战士。这一办法，焦五保最近又有了很大的发挥，它推动了新英雄主义和立功运动的发展，成了每次战斗胜利的有力保证，他不仅是能把不敢与不会打仗的新战士，带上战场一样的去作战，而且还培养了不少的战斗模范和英雄，如张麦麦就是其中的一个。
    张麦麦今年正月参军到了焦五保互助组，这一个没有出过远门的新战士，当然觉得困难很多，对部队生活不懂，不愿离开家自己更不会打仗，所以对工作很不安心，焦五保便首先从生活上政治上具体的帮助，解决了这些困难，并经常安慰他说：“这就是咱的家，以后咱们要在一起工作，一起吃饭，也一起打仗；你有啥困难尽量给我提，我可以设法帮助你解决”。焦五保就这样的团结了他，并转变了他的情绪。
    张麦麦刚来到，焦五保先教他懂的了武器的性能，以后焦五保便经常的带领他到操场里，学三大技术，或带他到野外练习杀敌运动和利用地形，并能把学习的动作，和他过去的战斗经验结合起来教。这种战教结合的方式，使张学的感到学习很重要，并很有兴趣，虽说把臂部都练肿了，可是还不觉得疼和疲劳。有一次在野外练习时，焦五保给他讲了一个战斗故事，说他过去用这个动作，怎样消灭了敌人，又怎样捉了俘虏……。张麦麦听了高兴的说：“如果打仗就象这样，保险在战斗中不落怕死鬼。”
    第二次南渡时，他连接受了消灭曲沃敌人的任务，战前焦五保组就开了想办法会，他知道张是新战士，一定害怕，又特别的给他谈话，使他不要怕跟上队，并告诉他说：“远了不敢乱打枪，地形要利用好”。还告诉了些躲避子弹和躲避炮弹的办法。
    部队还没有接近敌人，敌人就在工事里向着广阔的河滩，疯狂的扫射，还喊叫“捉活的”“冲呀”！张麦麦没有经过这种战斗场面，心里有些害怕，焦五保马上说：“你别怕，敌人乱打枪、乱叱呼，主要是怕咱攻他。”这几句话使张觉得心里发亮起来，身上好象立刻增加了许多勇气。他们冲到敌人的工事跟前，焦五保指挥着张麦麦、王子财、何福图，向敌人工事打炸弹，果然一排子炸弹在敌人阵地里开了花，焦五保又说：“张麦麦赶快跑进工事里去，打不着”！焦五保、王子财、张麦麦等同志，又都跑进工事里，就是没有一点事。敌人见他们进了工事都吓跑了，焦五保又带上张追击敌人，在追击时，张得了一枝枪，俘虏了一个敌人。这第一次战斗，张麦麦算是得胜了，他高兴的向焦五保说：“和中央军打仗就是这样”？焦五保笑着说：“你以为怎样？和中央军打仗的经验是：远不打枪，近不叱呼。利用好地形，摸到跟前，炸弹一打就冲，敌人保险缴枪。”张想起他昨晚打仗的情形，也就是这样，张这才觉得今后打仗有把握了。
    曲沃战斗他表现最勇敢，在巷战中，第一个冲进院里，缴了三挺机枪，俘虏了几十个人。后来在乡宁襄陵战斗，又表现很好，就这样的，新战士张麦麦学会了焦五保这一套战法，就成了连战连捷的老英雄了。（完）
