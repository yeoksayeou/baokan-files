    Britain and France Want Cake, But Bite Mud; Increasingly Impatient and Irritable with the United States
    In the past week, several signs have indicated that Britain and France are becoming increasingly impatient and irritated with the United States, which is obsessed with supporting Germany and acting as the master of Western Europe, and are making various gestures. Bevin, in his speech on the 26th, even openly declared, "Fight against the dollar." The London Times, which not long ago was desperately promoting the "American Plan," now also hopes that the future four foreign ministers' meeting will discuss the German issue; and proposes, "Care should be taken to ensure the success of the November meeting." The French government stated on the 25th that "all issues related to Germany must be discussed at the London Four Foreign Ministers' Conference scheduled for November." Shortly after, Bevin officially invited the Soviet Union, the United States, and France on the 29th to hold a foreign ministers' assistants' meeting in October to prepare for the foreign ministers' meeting on the German issue. On August 1, Bevin threatened the United States, saying that the United States should "withdraw its troops" from Italy and Greece as soon as possible; at the same time, although the Anglo-Soviet trade negotiations have temporarily failed, British officials still expressed optimism about the Anglo-Soviet trade expansion, and British warships suddenly made a visit to the Soviet Union at the end of July. All this shows the increasing contradiction between Britain (including France) and the United States.
    The reasons for this situation are, on the one hand, that Britain and France originally wanted to eat some "cake" while running around for the "Marshall Plan," but ended up eating "a mouthful of mud"; on the other hand, it is due to the increasingly serious economic difficulties and the political crisis caused by the foreign policy of pinning hopes on American aid. For example, during the recent debate on the economic crisis in the British House of Commons, most Labor MPs expressed dissatisfaction with the government's policy of waiting for American aid, especially the Labor left wing expressed firm opposition, and some anonymous Labor MPs even wrote to Attlee, demanding an immediate reorganization of the cabinet, and insisting that "ministers who have failed or are failing must give way." The crisis of the British Labor cabinet is so profound that even the British bourgeois newspapers have issued warnings: if the government does not implement a large-scale reorganization during the parliamentary recess, the cabinet is in danger of collapsing.
    Although, so far, the British and French authorities have not completely abandoned the illusion of American "aid"; and in order to ease the rigid situation of Britain and France on the issue of Ruhr production increase, the United States has had to make some superficial and temporary "concessions" in an attempt to continue leading Britain and France by the nose. According to Reuters dispatches on July 28 and 29, the United States did not include the issue of Ruhr control in the agenda of the future Anglo-American meeting in Washington, and Marshall also ordered the suspension of the publication of the Anglo-American plan signed in Berlin to increase Germany's industrial level, and notified France of this move. At the same time, under pressure from the United States, Britain has reluctantly agreed to attend the Anglo-American Ruhr coal production conference, which has been delayed for two weeks. But the wolf always wants to eat people. US Secretary of the Army Royal said in Berlin one day: "Germany is a very important part of Europe. Any European plan must include German economic reconstruction." He also insisted that the United States should adopt a resolution on Germany without consulting France. This established and unchanging policy of aggression and expansion by American imperialism will inevitably intensify the fundamental contradictions between Britain, France, and the United States, leading directly to a fundamental change in the current division of the four powers; this is the basic trend of international relations.
    As for the so-called eleven-nation peace conference on Japan, which the United States unilaterally planned to convene on August 19, it has been announced by the United States itself as a failure due to the Soviet Union's opposition and Britain's procrastination. According to Washington officials on July 29, the US plan has been postponed; until when has not yet been decided.
    In the Far East, the Dutch-Indonesian war, which the United States is trying to incite, has been raging recently. Encouraged by the US and Britain and supplied with war funds and munitions, the Dutch imperialists broke off peace talks on July 21 and launched a large-scale offensive; originally intending to force Indonesia to submit, the result was a resolute counterattack by the entire Indonesian country. The Indonesian patriotic self-defense war has aroused the sympathy and support of the world, especially the World Federation of Trade Unions and the working class and democrats in the Netherlands, Britain, India, Australia, etc. The anti-war movement is being launched in the Dutch imperialist homeland; the governments of India and Australia filed a complaint against the Netherlands in the Security Council on July 30, demanding the cessation of Dutch aggression. The Security Council resolved on the 2nd to demand a ceasefire between the Netherlands and Indonesia, which may not necessarily produce an effect that is beneficial to Indonesia, but it has severely damaged the United States' attempt to carry out so-called "mediation" outside the United Nations to buy time for the Netherlands to increase its troops, and the imperialist argument that "the Indonesian war is a Dutch internal affair and the Security Council should not interfere."

### 英法想吃饼子啃了烂泥  对美愈益表现不耐烦燥

    英法想吃饼子啃了烂泥
    对美愈益表现不耐烦燥
    这一周来，若干迹象显示：英法对醉心扶植德国俨然要做西欧主人的美国，已愈来愈表现出不耐和烦燥，作出种种姿态。贝文在二十六日的讲演中，竟公开宣称：“与美元作斗争。”不久以前还是为“美国计划”拚命鼓吹打气的伦敦泰晤士报，现在也要寄希望于未来的四外长会议来讨论德国问题了；并且提出：“应小心谨慎以使十一月会议能够成功。”在法国官方于二十五日表示“有关德国之全部问题，务须由定于十一月召开的伦敦四外长会议讨论。”不久后，贝文即于二十九日正式邀请苏美法于十月间召开外长助理会，以筹备对德问题的外长会议。八月一日，贝文又要胁美国，说美国要尽速自意、希两国“撤兵”；同时，英苏贸易谈判虽已暂告失败，英国官方仍为英苏扩展贸易事故表乐观，而英舰七月底又忽作访苏之行。这一切表现出英国（法国亦在内）与美国矛盾之增长。
    造成这种情况的原因，一方面是由于英法在为“马歇尔计划”奔波中，原想吃到一些“饼子”，但结果却吃了“满嘴烂泥”；另一方面，则由于日益深重的经济困难及寄希望于美国援助的外交政策所引起之政治危机。例如英国最近在下院辩论经济危机时，国会中的大部分工党议员，对政府等待美国援助之政策咸表不满，尤其是工党左翼表示了坚决反对的立场，甚至有匿名的工党议员致书艾德礼，要求立即改组内阁，并坚主“业已失败或正趋失败的部长必须让位”。英工党内阁的危机竟如此深重，甚至英资产阶级的报纸亦纷纷发出警告：如果在下院休会期间政府不实行大规模改组，内阁即有垮台危险。
    虽然，迄今为止，英法当局希望美国“援助”的幻想仍未完全抛弃；而美国为了缓和英法对鲁尔增产问题的僵化形势，不得不作了一些表面与暂时的“让步”，企图继续牵着英法的鼻子跑。据路透社七月二十八日与二十九日电称：关于鲁尔控制权问题，美国并未将其列入未来华府英美会议议事日程，马歇尔也命令暂停公布英美在柏林签订的提高德国工业水平计划，并将此举措通知法国。同时，在美国的压力下，英国已勉强答应出席已拖延了两周的英美鲁尔煤产会议。但是狼总是要吃人的，美国陆长罗雅尔一日在柏林说：“德国是欧洲极重要的一部分、任何欧洲计划，必须包括德国经济重建在内”。并力主：美国对德采取决议，并不需要与法国商议。这一美国帝国主义既定不变的侵略的扩张政策，必然使英法美的基本矛盾越演越烈，直引至根本改变目前四强关系的分野；这是国际关系发展的基本趋向。
    至于美国独自包办打算在八月十九日召开的所谓十一国对日和会问题，由于苏联的反对和英国的推托，已由美国自己宣布流产了。据华府官方人员七月二十九日宣称，美国之计划已延期；延至何时，尚未决定。
    在远东，美国极力煽火的荷印战事，最近猛烈进行。荷兰帝国主义者在美英鼓励与战费军火供应下，于七月二十一日破裂和谈，发动大规模攻势；原想威逼印尼屈服，结果却招来了印尼举国一致坚决抗战的反击。印尼爱国自卫战引起了举世的特别是世界职工联盟及荷、英、印、澳等国工人阶级及民主人士的同情与声援，反战运动正在荷兰帝国主义本土开展；印度与澳洲政府于七月三十日并在安理会提出对荷兰的控诉，要求制止荷兰的侵略行为。安理会二日决议，要求荷印双方停战，这固然不一定产生有利于印尼的效果，但却使美国在联合国之外单独进行为荷兰争取增兵时间的所谓“调停”企图，及所谓“印尼战事乃荷兰内政不容安理会干涉”之帝国主义论调，遭到严重打击。（新华社）
