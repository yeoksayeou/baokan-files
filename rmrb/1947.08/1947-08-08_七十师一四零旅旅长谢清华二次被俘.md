    Seventh Division, 140th Brigade Commander
    Xie Qinghua Captured for the Second Time
    [Xinhua News Agency, Jinan Front, 6th] Xie Qinghua, the newly appointed brigade commander of the 140th Brigade of the Kuomintang's 70th Division, who was captured in the battle to annihilate the Kuomintang's 70th Division southeast of Ju-ye, was captured for the second time. The first time was on January 4th of this year during the battle of Xiangcheng in southern Shandong, when he was captured by the East China People's Liberation Army. At that time, Xie was the brigade commander of the 169th Brigade of the 26th Division. After being captured, he feigned madness and pretended to be someone else. He was released by the East China People's Liberation Army. The Central News Agency repeatedly praised his ability to deceive because of this. In the same month, the 140th Brigade of the Kuomintang's 70th Division was annihilated for the first time on the outskirts of Jinxiang, and the brigade commander Xie Maoquan was captured. After Chiang Kai-shek reorganized the 140th Brigade, he immediately replaced that Xie (Xie Maoquan) with this Xie (Xie Qinghua). This time he was captured alive again. But his ability to deceive didn't work anymore. According to Xie's statement to reporters: When he was captured, he hid behind a grave, changed into a soldier's uniform, and attempted to escape by deception for the second time, but he was exposed on the spot by officers of the brigade who had laid down their weapons. The reporter hinted to him that even if he could侥幸 escape this time, as long as he returned to the front line of the civil war, he would either die or be captured sooner or later. Xie Qinghua said with a red face: "Zhuge Liang captured Meng Huo seven times, but today's Zhuge Liang cannot be compared with today's People's Liberation Army, and we cannot be compared with Meng Huo." He said very dejectedly: "This time I went to the front line, knowing that there would be no good end, but because of the burden of my family, which requires 2 million yuan in expenses every month, I had to take another risk." Then Xie Qinghua described with a terrified expression the heavy casualties caused by the mutual trampling of Kuomintang troops in the annihilation battle near Liushi on July 14th. Finally, he said: "I am very fortunate to have侥幸 survived this time."

    七十师一四零旅旅长
    谢清华二次被俘
    【新华社冀鲁豫前线六日电】钜野东南歼灭蒋军七十师之战时，被俘蒋军七十师一四零旅新任旅长谢清华，为第二次被俘。第一次是今年一月四日在鲁南向城之战中，为华东解放军俘虏，当时谢为二十六师一六九旅旅长，被俘后他装疯卖傻，冒充他职，经华东解放军释放。中央社曾因此再三称赞他的蒙混本领。同月，蒋军七十师一四零旅在金乡外围第一次被歼、旅长谢懋权被俘，蒋介石于一四零旅整补后，即将这谢（谢清华）补那谢（谢懋权），这次又被生擒。但混蒙的本领不灵了，据谢对记者称：被俘时他躲在一个坟堆后面，换了士兵衣服，企图第二次混蒙脱逃，但被该旅放下武器之军官当场揭穿。记者暗示他，即使此次又能侥幸逃脱，只要重上内战前线，早晚不死即俘。谢清华红着面孔说：“孔明七擒孟获，但当日之孔明，那能比今日之解放军，且我们更不能和孟获相比。”并十分颓丧地说：“我这次上前线，明知没有好下场，只是为了家室之累每月需要二百万元的开支，只得再来冒险一次”。接着谢清华就以谈虎色变的神气叙述这次七月十四日六师集附近歼灭战，蒋军人马自相践踏死伤惨重的经过，最后他说：“这回我能侥幸不死，很值得自己庆幸。”
