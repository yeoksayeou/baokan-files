    What a dark state our country was in on this day twenty years ago, August 1, 1927! Following Chiang Kai-shek's April betrayal in Shanghai, Wang Jingwei and Sun Ke also staged the July betrayal in Wuhan, and the Great Revolution of 1925-1927 failed nationwide. Chiang Kai-shek and his gang of imperialist running dogs established a Nanjing counter-revolutionary government that was even more dependent on foreign imperialism and more cruelly oppressed and exploited the people than the Northern Warlords. Communists and other democrats, the main force of the Great Revolution, and workers and peasants were arrested and massacred everywhere. At this time, the diminished Chinese Communist Party, as Comrade Mao Zedong said, "rose from the ground, wiped the blood from its body, buried the bodies of its comrades, and continued to fight." It was this small Communist Party that represented the unyielding will to survive and the tradition of struggle of our country's 450 million people. Their first cry for continued struggle was the Nanchang Uprising on August 1, 1927. Under the leadership of revolutionary generals such as Zhu De, He Long, and Ye Ting, the first army in our history that belonged entirely to the people emerged. Countless tragic lessons finally made our people realize that in order to protect their right to survival and realize their revolutionary demands, they must organize a completely revolutionary army that belongs entirely to the people, with a firm stand, bravery, skill in battle, and strict discipline. After all the tragic events, if the democrats in our country still thought that such an army was unnecessary, and if they still thought that they could not value, protect, and develop this army, then they were not people who were prepared to be responsible for their ideals and declarations, they were not sincere and serious democrats, but frivolous empty talkers; they were prepared to sacrifice millions more lives to the cannibalistic imperialists and their running dogs. Therefore, regardless of all kinds of hardships, encirclement and pursuit, slander and rumors, conspiracies and intrigues, the Chinese Communist Party and the Chinese people, under the leadership of Mao Zedong, were determined to persistently and unyieldingly uphold and develop this revolutionary force to this day. Relying on this force, our people broke through the darkness after the failure of the Great Revolution, ignited the flames of land revolution in the southern provinces and the Shaanxi-Gansu-Ningxia Border Region. Relying on this force, our people established the Anti-Japanese National United Front during the Japanese invasion, and carried out the great People's War of Resistance Against Japan in Northeast China, North China, Central China, and Guangdong. Relying on this force, our people have victoriously resisted the new offensive of Chiang Kai-shek, supported by American imperialism, and are working hard to realize an independent, peaceful, and democratic New China. The dark age of twenty years ago is gone forever, and our country is now full of hope. Although Chiang Kai-shek is still conscripting soldiers, collecting grain, arresting people, and killing people in his shrinking ruling area, even in that area, the majority of people (including officials, merchants, gentry, and all levels of civil and military officials inside and outside the Kuomintang) already know that that situation will not last long. When drinking water, one must remember the source. What force has caused this great change between twenty years ago and now? It is the people and the leadership of the Communist Party. But the most direct force is the Chinese People's Liberation Army, founded by the Nanchang Uprising, led by the Communist Party, and consciously organized by the people!
    The twenty-year history of the People's Liberation Army contains rich and multifaceted experiences, and it is impossible to describe them all in a short article. Here, we will only talk about the most basic experience that needs to be repeatedly explained, that is, a revolutionary force, as long as it truly relies on the masses, will never be overwhelmed by the enemy, and therefore should never be frightened by the enemy. When the revolution of 1927 failed, many wavering people were frightened by the enemy. They only saw a dark and gloomy sky, and they concluded that our country's revolution was over, or at least they would not see the light in their lifetime. So they left the front line of the Chinese revolution with mournful faces. But contrary to their predictions, the People's Liberation Army emerged precisely in this high tide of "changing the sky thinking." After its establishment, the People's Liberation Army continued to be attacked by "changing the sky thinking," because whenever a gust of wind blew and a dark cloud came, these wavering elements would always announce that "the end of the world is coming" in response. In fact, the political sky often has dark clouds. For example, the Nanchang Uprising suffered setbacks at first, and the Autumn Harvest Uprisings and Guangzhou Uprising in many places in the same year also suffered setbacks. Until 1928, when the Red Army seized the Jinggang Mountains on the border of Hunan and Jiangxi and other areas as its base, people were still wondering "how long the red flag can last." After 1930, the Red Army began to develop greatly, smashed the enemy's many encirclements and suppressions in many places, and its strength increased to 300,000 in three or four years. However, due to subjective errors in the leading organs at that time, coupled with objective difficulties, the main force of the Jiangxi Red Army and the Red Army in western Hubei and northern Sichuan were successively forced to make the 25,000-li Long March towards northern Shaanxi. This unprecedented difficulty in human history not only reduced the Red Army to tens of thousands of people, but also made many people think that the Eighth Route Army and the New Fourth Army, reorganized from the Red Army, were just some tattered guerrillas until the early stage of the War of Resistance Against Japan, and they did not believe that they could develop into the main force to persist in the War of Resistance Against Japan. After this, the market for pessimism became smaller and smaller; but for example, during the most difficult period of the War of Resistance Against Japan in 1942, during the most rampant offensive of Chiang Kai-shek last October, and in many local areas that encountered temporary serious situations, some people were unfortunately not without those who were alarmed by the slightest disturbance, and even lost their souls. And in some twists and turns in the future, these people will still appear repeatedly under various names and faces, but on the whole, the tendency of these wavering elements today is no longer manifested in fear of the failure of the revolution, but in a lack of courage in the great leap forward. What needs to be overcome today is generally no longer the difficulties in defense, but the difficulties in advancing, and this kind of difficulty will also frighten some people, bind their spirit and will, and make them afraid of victory. As for the "democratic elements" in Chiang Kai-shek's ruling area, they still continue to believe that the result of the struggle between Chiang Kai-shek and the people will be that neither side will be able to eliminate the other. In short, the common characteristic of these people is that they are not good at calmly and comprehensively analyzing the situation, they are not good at distinguishing which factors are only temporarily playing a role, and which are playing a constant role; they are not good at distinguishing which forces, even if they seem very powerful for the time being, have begun to decline, and which forces, even if they seem very weak for the time being, are developing forward. The clouds in the sky, the advantages of the reactionaries, the mistakes and twists and turns of the revolutionary movement, these are temporarily playing a role. And the brightness of the sun, the contradictions between the reactionaries and the people, and the resulting unsolvable crisis of the reactionaries, the power of the people's awakening and unity, the power of revolutionary truth, these are constantly playing a role. Therefore, the People's Liberation Army, which relies on constantly acting elements in this respect, was temporarily weak, and is still not very strong, but because it constantly relies on the masses, it has overcome various difficulties and become strong, and will become even stronger in the future. On the other hand, the Chiang Kai-shek reactionary faction and its master, the foreign reactionary faction, which rely on temporarily acting factors, were temporarily strong, and are still quite strong, but because they constantly implement policies of oppressing and exploiting the masses, they will inevitably move towards inevitable death. Not understanding this truth makes some people often lack confidence, often lose their way, often be intimidated by temporary, one-sided and superficial phenomena, and often be deceived and enslaved by their own mistakes. The twenty-year history of the People's Liberation Army proves that facts are not developing according to these people's ideas. The most basic experience of the twenty-year history of the People's Liberation Army is that the above-mentioned truth must be constantly taught to the people, constantly taught to every soldier and cadre in its own ranks, so that the entire army and the entire people can constantly recognize the true trend of history and have full confidence in their own strength, in order to overcome all possible difficulties and strive for all possible victories.
    Twenty years ago, in 1927, there was a revolutionary war and a revolutionary upsurge in China—the Northern Expedition; the Northern Expedition was the product of cooperation between the Kuomintang and the Communist Party, and in form it was dominated by the Kuomintang, and in the end it failed due to the betrayal of the Kuomintang. This revolution left the seeds of the People's Liberation Army. Although the People's Liberation Army suffered setbacks in its rapid development in the next ten years, it preserved its backbone, and relying on this backbone, ten years ago, in 1937, another revolutionary war and revolutionary upsurge—the War of Resistance Against Japan—emerged in our country. The War of Resistance Against Japan was the product of the second cooperation between the Kuomintang and the Communist Party, but this time the two parties acted independently. Although the Kuomintang insisted on its reactionary policy and continued to oppose the Communist Party and the people, the Communist Party avoided being affected by this policy of the Kuomintang and was able to independently implement the strategy of people's war. As a result, the Kuomintang could not surrender to Japan even if it wanted to, because the People's Liberation Army developed more rapidly and became the main force of the War of Resistance Against Japan. Now it is 1947, and there is a new revolutionary war in our country, and it is on the eve of a new national revolutionary upsurge. The possibility of cooperation between the Kuomintang and the Communist Party has been finally eliminated by the Kuomintang. The rule of the Kuomintang headed by Chiang Kai-shek has become the target of the people's revolution, and the Communist Party has become the sole leader of the revolutionary war. This situation has not only fundamentally changed the situation in China, making it impossible for the Chinese reactionaries headed by Chiang Kai-shek to save their final demise, but also opened a gap in the world rule of imperialism headed by American reactionaries in China, just as in the Soviet Union and Eastern European countries, making it impossible for international reactionaries to fill this gap. Today, the task of the People's Liberation Army and the task of the people of the whole country is to use all their strength to advance steadily and bravely to realize the current situation slogans put forward by the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China on July 7 this year. All commanders and fighters of the People's Liberation Army must deeply understand these slogans put forward by the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China, which are all completely realistic action slogans without exception; realizing these slogans is the current task of our people across the country. And first of all, it is the current task of our People's Liberation Army. The first slogan is to resolutely, thoroughly, cleanly, and completely eliminate all Chiang Kai-shek's invading troops. This is the key to the whole problem. The enemy's invading troops, including the several brigades attacking the Central Plains and the Guangdong people's guerrilla war, total only more than 220 brigades. We have already eliminated nearly 110 brigades. Even if the enemy replenishes them all, they will become weaker and weaker and slower and slower, unable to keep up with the speed at which they are eliminated. So, is there any doubt that the task of eliminating all invading troops can be completed? In the process of eliminating all invading troops and after that, it will of course be possible to establish a democratic coalition government, and of course it will be necessary to punish the war criminals headed by Chiang Kai-shek, confiscate bureaucratic capital, abolish the secret service, and abolish the traitorous treaties. Is there any doubt about all this? In order to eliminate all invading troops, it is of course necessary to learn positional warfare and outflanking tactics; in order not to let an enemy escape, it is of course necessary to strictly observe discipline, protect the people, and resolutely implement the policy of "land to the tillers," develop production, and save resources. Is there any doubt about all this? These tasks must be accomplished and are entirely possible to accomplish, and how bright will our country become when these tasks are accomplished! Of course, as mentioned earlier, we will inevitably encounter many difficulties in our progress, but if we recall the difficulties we have encountered in the past twenty years, if we recall the difficulties at the time of the failure of the revolution in 1927, and if we recall the difficulties during the 25,000-li Long March from 1934 to 1935, then what is there to be afraid of in these difficulties? The Chinese People's Liberation Army, which has experienced twenty years of struggle, and the Chinese People's Liberation Army, which has reviewed twenty years of struggle experience, will surely overcome all difficulties, resolutely carry out the great tasks given by the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China, and bravely rush to that inevitable sacred goal—defeating Chiang Kai-shek and establishing a New China.

### 人民解放军二十周年

    人民解放军二十周年
    在二十年前的今天，一九二七年的八月一日，我们的国家曾经是怎样的黑暗啊！跟着蒋介石在上海的四月叛变以后，汪精卫、孙科在武汉也举行了七月叛变，一九二五年至一九二七年的大革命在全国范围内失败了。以蒋介石为首的帝国主义走狗们，建立了比北洋军阀更加依赖外国帝国主义，更加残酷的压迫剥削人民的南京反革命政府。大革命的主力共产党人及其他民主分子和工农群众，到处遭受逮捕和残杀，被缩小了的中国共产党就在这个时候，如毛泽东同志所说：“从地下爬起来揩干净身上的血迹，掩埋好同伴的尸首，他们又继续战斗了。”正是这个小小的共产党代表了我国四万万五千万人民坚强不屈的求生意志和奋斗传统，他们的继续战斗的第一声，就是一九二七年八月一日的南昌起义，在朱德、贺龙、叶挺等革命将领领导下，出现了我国历史上第一支完全属于人民的军队，无数次悲惨的教训终于使我国人民得到一个觉悟：就是为了保护自己的生存权利，实现自己的革命要求，就必须组织一支完全属于人民的、立场坚定、勇敢善战、纪律严明的彻底革命化的军队。在一切悲惨事变以后，如果我国的民主分子还以为可以不需要一个这样的军队，还以为可以不重视不保护不发展这个军队，那么他就不是一个准备对自己的理想和宣言负责的人，他就不是一个诚恳郑重的民主主义者，而是一个儿戏的空谈家；他就是准备再把成百万的生命送给吃人的帝国主义者及其走狗去作牺牲。因此不顾各种各样的艰难困苦，围剿穷追、飞短流长、阴谋诡计，中国共产党和中国人民在毛泽东的领导之下，决心百折不挠地坚持和发展这个革命的队伍至于今日。依靠这个队伍我国人民冲破了大革命失败后的黑暗，在南方各省和陕甘宁边区燃起了土地革命的怒火，依靠这个队伍，我国人民在日本侵略时期建立了抗日民族统一战线，在东北、华北、华中和广东进行了伟大的人民抗日战争。依靠这个队伍，我国人民胜利地抵抗了美国帝国主义所支持的蒋介石的新进攻，并正在努力实现一个独立、和平、民主的新中国。二十年前的黑暗时代是一去不复返了，我们的国家现在是充满了希望。虽然蒋介石在其日益缩小的统治区中，还在征兵、征粮、捉人、杀人，但是就在那个区域，多数人（包括国民党内外的官商绅董文武百僚）也已经知道那个局面是不会长久的了。饮水思源，究竟是什么力量造成了二十年前后的这个大变化？是人民、是共产党的领导。但是最直接的力量却是南昌起义所创始的、共产党所领导、人民所自觉组织的中国人民解放军啊！
    人民解放军的二十年历史，包含丰富的多方面的经验，要在一篇短文里说完是不可能的。这里只说一个最基本的和最需要反复说明的经验，这就是一个革命力量，只要是真正依靠群众，就永远不会被敌人压倒，因此也永远是应该不被敌人吓倒。当一九二七年革命失败的时候，许多不坚定的人们就是被敌人吓倒了，他们只见一片天昏地暗，他们断定我国的革命是完了，至少终其一生是看不见光明的了，于是哭丧着脸脱离中国革命的战线，但是与他们的预言相反，正在这个“变天思想”的高潮中，人民解放军产生出来了。人民解放军在成立以后，还是要受“变天思想”的继续袭击，因为每当那里出了一股风，吹来一朵乌云，就总有这种不坚定的分子宣布“世界的末日来了”为响应。事实上政治的天空却是常有乌云的，比方说：首先南昌起义就受了挫折，同年的多处秋收起义和广州起义也受了挫折，直到一九二八年红军取得了湘赣边的井岗山及其他区域为根据地的时候，人民还在怀疑着“红旗到底能打得多久”。一九三○年以后，红军开始了大的发展，粉碎了敌人的多次多处围剿，三四年间兵力增加到三十万人；但是随着又因为那时领导机关中主观上的错误，加上客观上的困难，江西红军主力和湘鄂西、川北的红军相继被迫作转向陕北的二万五千里长征，这个人类历史上空前未有的困难，不但使红军缩小为几万人，而且使许多人到抗日战争初期还以为由红军改编的八路军、新四军只是一些破烂的游击队，而不相信他们能发展为坚持抗日战争的主力。在这以后，悲观主义的市场是越来越小了；但是例如在一九四二年抗日战争的最艰苦时期，在去年十月蒋介石进攻最猖獗时期，以及在其他许多遭遇暂时严重情况的局部地区，一遇到什么风吹草动就大惊小怪，甚至丧魂失魄的人们，可惜还不是没有。而在将来的某些曲折中，这些人们也仍然会以各种姓名面貌重复地出现，但是整个的说来，今天这些不坚定分子的倾向，已经不是表现为害怕革命的失败，而是表现为大踏步前进中的不够勇敢。今天所需要克服的一般地已经不是防御中的困难，而是前进中的困难，而这种困难一样也会把有些人们吓倒，束缚他们的精神意志，使他们不敢于胜利。至于在蒋介石统治区甚至还有这种“民主分子”，继续以为蒋介石和人民斗争的结果会是谁也消灭不了谁。总之这些人们的共同特点，就是不善于冷静地全面地分析情况，就是不善于区别什么因素只是暂时起作用，而什么却是经常起作用的；就是不善于区别什么力量，即使暂时似乎还很强大却已经开始衰亡，而什么力量即使暂时似乎还很弱小，却是正在向前发展的东西。天上的乌云，反动派的优势，革命运动的错误和曲折，这些是暂时起作用的。而太阳的光明，反动派与人民的矛盾，和由此而来的反动派的不可解救的危机，人民的觉悟和团结的力量，革命真理的力量，这些是经常起作用的。因此在这一方面依靠经常起作用的要素而生长的人民解放军，暂时曾经是弱小的，现在也还未十分强大，但是由于它经常依靠群众，它就战胜了各种困难而强大起来，以后还要更加强大。而在另一方面，依靠暂时起作用的因素而存在的蒋介石反动派及其主人外国反动派暂时曾经是强大的，现在也还相当强大，但是由于它经常执行压迫剥削群众的政策，它就必然日趋于毫无例外的死亡。不懂得这个真理，就使得有些人们经常缺乏信心，经常迷失方向，经常被暂时的片面的和表面的现象所恐吓，经常被自己的错误所欺骗和奴役。人民解放军的二十年历史，证明事实并不是按照这些人们的想法发展的。人民解放军二十年历史的最基本经验，就是必须把上述的真理经常教育人民，经常教育自己队伍中的每一个战士和干部，使全军全民经常认识历史的真实动向，对于自己的力量具有充分的信念，以便克服一切可能的困难，争取一切可能的胜利。
    二十年前的一九二七年，中国是存在着一个革命战争和革命高潮——北伐；北伐是国共合作的产物，在形式上是以国民党为主体，结果也以国民党的叛变而失败，这个革命留下了人民解放军的种子。人民解放军在以后十年的迅速发展中虽然遭了挫折，但是保存了骨干，并且依靠这个骨干，在十年前的一九三七年产生了我国又一个革命战争和革命高潮——抗日。抗日是国共第二次合作的产物，但是这次是两党各自为政，国民党虽然坚持其反动政策，继续反共反人民，共产党却避免了受国民党这种政策的影响，能够独立自主地执行人民战争的方针，结果国民党虽欲投降日本而不可得，因为人民解放军得到了更迅速的发展，成了抗日的主体。现在是一九四七年，我国又存在着新的革命战争，并且正处于新的全国性的革命高潮的前夜，国共合作的可能被国民党最后消灭了，以蒋介石为首的国民党统治成为人民革命的目标，共产党成为革命战争的唯一领导者，这个情况不但使中国的局面发生了根本的变化，使以蒋介石为首的中国反动派无法挽救自己的最后死亡，而且使以美国反动派为首的帝国主义的世界统治，在中国也与在苏联和东欧各国一样被打开了缺口，使国际反动派无法弥补这个缺口。今天人民解放军的任务，和全国人民的任务就是用一切力量脚踏实地勇猛前进，来实现今年七月七日中共中央所提出的时局口号。人民解放军的全体指战员，必须深刻了解中共中央所提出的这些口号，毫无例外地都是完全现实的行动口号；实现这些口号是我全国人民的当前任务。而首先则是我人民解放军的当前任务。首先一个口号就是坚决彻底干净全部地消灭一切蒋介石进犯军，这正是全部问题的关键，敌人的进犯军，包括进攻中原和广东人民游击战争的几个旅在内，一共只有二百二十多个旅，我们已经消灭掉它差不多一百一十个旅了，就算敌人都补充起来，也是越补越弱越补越慢，赶不上他们被消灭的速度。那么完成消灭一切进犯军的任务，难道还有什么疑问吗？在消灭一切进犯军的过程当中及其以后，就当然能够成立民主的联合政府，就当然要惩办以蒋介石为首的战争罪犯，没收官僚资本，取消特务机关，废除卖国条约，这一切还有什么疑问吗？为了消灭一切进犯军，就当然要学习阵地战和迂回战术；不让一个敌人逃跑，就当然要严守纪律、保护人民，就当然要坚决实现耕者有其田，发展生产节约，这一切还有什么疑问吗？这些任务是必须实现的，也是完全可能实现的，而实现了这些任务，我们的国家就将要变得怎样光明啊！当然如前所说，我们在前进中也不可免的要遇到许多困难，但是如果回想一下，我们在过去二十年中的困难，回想一下一九二七年革命失败时的困难，回想一下一九三四至一九三五年二万五千里长征中的困难，那么这些困难还有什么可怕呢？经历了二十年奋斗的中国人民解放军，温习了二十年奋斗经验的中国人民解放军，一定会不顾一切困难，坚决地执行中共中央所给予的伟大任务，勇敢地奔赴那个不可避免的神圣目标——战胜蒋介石建立新中国。
