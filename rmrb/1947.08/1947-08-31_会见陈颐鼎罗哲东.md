Meeting Chen Yiding and Luo Zhedong
    Liu Xiao＠
    On the afternoon of the 6th, I met Chen Yiding and Luo Zhedong, the former commander and deputy commander of the Kuomintang army's reorganized 70th Division, who had laid down their weapons, for the second time at a banquet hosted by General Wang Shiying, the Deputy Chief of Staff of the Jin-Ji-Lu-Yu Military Region. General Wang Shiying and Chen Yiding and Luo Zhedong were old classmates from Whampoa Military Academy. The banquet that day was partly to reminisce about the old days, and especially to celebrate the liberation of Chen Yiding and Luo Zhedong, who were fortunate enough to be pulled out of the quagmire of counter-revolutionary civil war.
    During the banquet, they constantly recalled their life at Whampoa during the Great Revolution and expressed deep emotions!
    Luo Zhedong raised his right hand high, holding a glass of wine, the ring on his finger flashing brightly. He said:
    "At that time, the morale of the revolutionary army was just like your troops today. The revolutionary army had very few people, only a few broken guns, but they defeated the Northern Warlords."
    He drank a glass of wine, looked at the table, and said:
    "Today, we have become the Northern Warlords of that time!"
    He repeatedly and emphatically mentioned:
    "At that time, when Whampoa classmates met, they would ask who had become a martyr. No one was afraid of death, and dying was considered an honor."
    But today, all of these things are gone forever.
    Filled with resentment, they expressed great dissatisfaction with the corruption of the Chiang government. Chen Yiding said resentfully:
    "He himself does not progress and does not allow others to progress, stubbornly dragging others down."
    Luo Zhedong also said:
    "Chen Cheng is someone who is fond of boasting and stubbornly self-opinionated. The people over there hate him to the bone."
    During the conversation, Chen Yiding fully expressed his fear of the People's Liberation Army and the masses being united as one, and of the people's war in the liberated areas. He said:
    "When we fought in the liberated areas, we were like blind men. You knew our situation very clearly, even knowing how tall our deputy division commander was, how big his eyes were, and how long his nose was."
    Chen Yiding is from Jiangsu, of medium height, with a more profound personality; Luo Zhedong is from Hunan, shorter, with a bit of the spicy personality of Hunan people. They were still wearing grass-green American military uniforms, and their attitude was humble and polite.
    After arriving in the rear of the People's Liberation Army, they once said to people: "The people in the liberated areas view the officers over there too favorably, which is not right."
    But I heard General Wang Shiying sincerely say to them:
    "The Communist Party does not regard all Kuomintang officers as hopeless reactionaries, as long as they stop being enemies of the people and stop doing evil, the people will still forgive them. If they stop fighting and oppose war, the people will welcome and treat them favorably. The more people involved in the revolution, the better, and the doors of the liberated areas are open."

　　会见陈颐鼎罗哲东
    刘晓＠
    六号下午，记者在晋冀鲁豫军区副参谋长王世英将军的宴席上，第二次会见了放下武器的蒋军整编七十师正副师长陈颐鼎和罗哲东。王世英将军和陈颐鼎、罗哲东是黄埔的老同学，那天的宴会，一来是叙旧，特别是替陈颐鼎和罗哲东庆祝解放的，他们已经很幸运地从反革命的内战泥潭被拉出来了。
    他们在宴席上不断回忆大革命时代的黄埔生活，发出很深的感慨！
    罗哲东的右手高举着酒杯，手指上的戒指闪闪地发着亮光，他说：
    “那个时候，革命军的士气是什么样子，就和今天你们的队伍一样，革命军的人数很少，只有几杆破枪，把北洋军阀打垮了。”
    他把一杯酒喝了，眼睛望着桌面，说：
    “今天我们变成了那时的北洋军阀！”
    他意味深长地再三再四地提到：
    “那时黄埔同学一见了面，就问谁做了烈士，没有一个人怕死，以死为光荣。”
    可是今天，这些东西已经都一去不复返了。
    他们怀着满肚子的愤慨，对蒋政府的腐败很为不满。他们陈愤恨，陈颐鼎说：
    “他自己不进步，还不叫别人进步，硬拉着别人下水。”
    罗哲东也说：
    “陈诚这个人，好大喜功，刚复自用，那边的人对他恨透了。”
    在谈话中，陈颐鼎对人民解放军和群众打成一片，对解放区的人民战争，充分表示了他的恐惧，他说：
    “我们到解放区作战，就好象子、瞎子一样，你们对我们的情况却摸得清清楚楚，连我们副师长个子多高，眼睛有多大，鼻子有多长都知道。”
    陈颐鼎是江苏人，中等身材，个性表现较深沉；罗哲东是湖南人，个子较矮，带点湖南人的辣椒性格。他们仍然都穿着草绿色美式军装，态度表现谦和多礼。
    他们来到解放军后方，曾经对人表示：“解放区的人对那边的军官都看得太右了，那是不对的。”
    可是我听见王世英将军诚恳地对他们说：
    “共产党并不是把国民党所有的军官，都看成是无可救药的反动分子，只要他们停止与人民为敌。停止为非做恶，人民仍会宽恕他们，如果他们罢战反战，人民还会欢迎和优待他们；革命是人越多越好，解放区的门是开着的。”
