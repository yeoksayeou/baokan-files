　　Jiao Wu Bao Sends Condolences to Wang Keqin
    [Our newspaper, Taiyue, 22nd] Jiao Wu Bao, the famous anti-Japanese hero of Taiyue, sent a letter of condolence to the hero Wang Keqin, who died in the Dingtao battle on the Jinan front. The original letter is as follows: Our hero Comrade Wang Keqin: We don't know each other. When I was recuperating in the hospital, I heard that you had forwarded a letter to me from Xinhua News Agency and the People's Daily. But when I recovered from my injury and was discharged from the hospital, just as I was about to reply to you, I suddenly heard that you had died in the battle of Dingtao. What an unfortunate thing! I feel very sad, but there are no tears, because your sacrifice is indeed a great loss, but you are a hero who sacrificed to defend the people and defend Chairman Mao. This is your glory. Rest in peace! Your blood has not been shed in vain. Chiang Kai-shek has only a few days to live. Our mutual aid group must learn from your strengths and be determined to avenge you in the future counter-offensive with the passion to defend Chairman Mao!
