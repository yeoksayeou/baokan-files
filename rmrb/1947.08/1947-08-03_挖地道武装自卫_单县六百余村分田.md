【This newspaper's report from the Hebei-Shandong-Henan Area on the 28th】The masses in the guerrilla zone of Shan County are enthusiastically distributing land. In early this month, nearly six hundred villages in Cao Ma, Guo Tang, and five other districts have been swept up in the tide of land distribution. The masses in villages three to five miles around Feng County and Shan County city have also risen up to distribute land, and mass organizations have been restored in 80% of the villages. The area has been transformed from a guerrilla zone into a guerrilla base area. Tunnels have been constructed in every village, and seven hundred young people in the county have joined the army. Their working experience is as follows: (1) First, they overcame the idea held by some cadres that land reform could not be carried out in guerrilla zones. Cadres often thought that the masses did not dare to ask for land or organize farmers' associations, so they did not implement land reform. In reality, this was the cadres' own right-leaning thinking, not understanding the peasants' strong desire for land. The 25-day land reform proved that the masses not only dared to ask for land and organize farmers' associations, but also actively participated in armed guerrilla warfare. The main reason for this is that the peasants felt that the armed forces were their reliance for protecting their land and lives after they got land. (2) Resolutely suppressing the worst landlords and destroying the old order is the key to opening up the situation and implementing land reform. (3) Land reform must truly follow the mass line, organizing "Land Distribution Appraisal Committees" dominated by poor peasants. It is necessary to boldly support the masses and help them remove obstacles. (4) The peasants near the county seat also have a very urgent demand for land reform. Therefore, we went deep into the area to implement land reform, and some adopted the method of "armed invitation" to arrest the landlords. (5) Land reform is the foundation of all work. After the peasants got land and struggled against the landlords, they naturally developed the desire to protect their land and lives, and demanded to strengthen their armed forces and persist in guerrilla warfare.

【This newspaper's report from the Taiyue Area on the 29th】The masses in the border area of Yuanqu County are carrying out land reform while fighting. In the villages near the county seat, the militia automatically organized four field companies, cooperating with the district detachments, and operating day and night in villages adjacent to the enemy. They won four consecutive victories from the 3rd to the 13th, killing and wounding ten enemies. The masses' courage to struggle has been greatly enhanced, shifting from opposing "counter-settlement" and "oil shops" to settling accounts with landlords. In the 11 administrative villages of the Second District, except for four villages including Nanzhuang, which are still under preparation, all are carrying out struggles in a vigorous manner, clearing twenty landlords with heinous crimes and recovering approximately ten thousand mu of land. The merchants in Gaoluo Town, under the influence of the peasant movement, have also organized to struggle against landlords and profiteers. Most of the merchants in the town are small vendors from Henan, and the market stalls they occupy are all owned by landlords such as Wang Lefu, with very high rents. After paying the rent, they can barely make a living. This time, the merchants also joined the peasants in struggling against landlords such as Wang Lefu, and cleared out Yang Liegong, the president of the puppet chamber of commerce, and profiteers such as He Chongming, recovering the market stalls.

    挖地道武装自卫
    单县六百余村分田
    【本报冀鲁豫二十八日电】单县游击区群众热烈分田。本月上旬，曹马、郭堂等七个区，近六百余村群众，卷入分田热潮。丰县、单县城周三、五里村庄群众也起来分田，百分之八十的村庄恢复了群众组织。该区已从游击区变为游击根据地，村村建设了地道，现全县已有七百青年参军。其工作经验如下：（一）首先克服了某些干部认为游击区不能土改的思想，干部常常以为群众不敢要地，不敢组织农会，因而就不实行土改，实则是干部本身的右倾思想，不了解农民强烈要求土地的心情，二十五天土改中证明：群众不但敢要土地、组织农会，而且能积极参加武装打游击，其主要原因：农民得到了土地感到武装是自己保田保命的靠山。（二）坚决镇压最坏地主，摧垮旧秩序，是打开局面实行土改的关键。（三）土改切实走群众路线，组织以贫农为主的“土地分配评议会”。要放手给群众撑腰，给群众搬石头。（四）县城附近的农民，要求土改也是很迫切的。因此我们深入进去实行土改，有的采用“武装请客”的办法将地主抓来。（五）土改是一切工作的基本，农民有了土地与地主进行了斗争，很自然产生保田保命的要求，要求壮大自己的武装，坚持游击战。
    【本报太岳二十九日电】垣曲边沿区群众一面打仗，一面进行土地改革。县城附近各村，民兵自动组织四个野战连，配合区中队，日夜活动于接敌村庄，三日至十三日曾连续打了四次胜仗，毙伤敌十名，群众斗争勇气大大提高，由反“倒算”反“油房”，进而清算地主。二区十一个行政村，除南庄等四村正在酝酿外，均轰轰烈烈开展斗争，共清算了二十个罪大恶极的地主，收回土地约万亩。皋落镇的商民，在农民运动的影响下，亦组织起来斗争地主与奸商。该镇商人多系河南小商贩，所占市所均为地主王乐甫等房屋，租率甚高，除交租外，仅够糊口。这次商人也与农民联合斗争地主王乐甫等，并清算了伪商会会长杨烈弓，奸商何崇明等收回了市房。
