Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, August 8th: According to delayed news reports from Shanghai newspapers, labor unrest in Shanghai continues to intensify. All 2,800-plus employees of the British-owned Shanghai Tram Company launched a strike and demonstration on June 30th to protest the employer's delay in responding to the workers' demands for improved welfare. All of the company's vehicles were out of service for nine hours. When the petitioning team left the factory, Chiang Kai-shek's Jiangning Police Bureau dispatched police officers to block them, but failed. After the petitioning workers arrived at Chiang Kai-shek's Social Affairs Bureau, they posted slogans everywhere. Workers' representatives negotiated with Chiang Kai-shek's Social Affairs Bureau for three hours, finally winning a preliminary victory. At the Meizhou Road Hua Aluminum Refined Steel Factory, because the employer dismissed 100 workers under false pretenses, hundreds of workers from the factory petitioned Chiang Kai-shek's Social Affairs Bureau on July 1st to protest the dismissals. When negotiations proved ineffective, the workers surrounded the conference room and guarded the bureau's entrance, vowing to fight to the death until their goals were achieved. The situation became tense, and Chiang Kai-shek's Social Affairs Bureau even telegraphed the Songshan Branch Bureau to send police to suppress the workers. The workers are still brewing new actions. On June 13th, workers at the French-owned Tram Company went on strike for six hours to protest the unreasonable dismissal of employees, causing chaos in Shanghai's transportation. Workers from over 400 silk weaving factories in Districts 1, 2, 3, and 4 also staged a three-hour slowdown at 2:00 PM on June 18th to protest the employer's payment of wages at 66% of the cost of living index. At the same time, more than ten apprentices from the Tongbei Road Huafu Machine Factory, unable to bear the factory owner's abuse, were led by representatives from the Fourth District Machine Workers' Union to petition Chiang Kai-shek's Social Affairs Bureau, demanding improved treatment for child laborers.

Xinhua News Agency, Shandong, August 8th: After more than 400 employees of Chiang Kai-shek's Qingdao Transportation Company went on strike on June 20th to oppose layoffs, they had achieved preliminary victories by July 8th. After the strike broke out, the company's manager, Gao Shengshu, suddenly led a platoon of soldiers at 8:30 PM on June 25th to surround the company, forcibly attempting to dismiss 160 employees. The laid-off employees protested one after another, and the more than 200 employees who were retained also went on strike at the same time, refusing to drive, in order to support the struggle of the laid-off employees. Chiang's municipal government attempted to select 35 people from the laid-off employees to divide the workers' unity, but was exposed by the workers. On July 8th, workers rushed into the manager's office and raised questions. Manager Gao Shengshu and Factory Director Zhu adopted a truculent attitude, and were severely beaten. Gao was forced to apologize to the workers and tendered his resignation. Fearing the expansion of the situation, Chiang Kai-shek's municipal government has ordered the company to write letters to all workers to reinstate them.
