　　Continue to Implement Economy and Prepare for Famine
  　Taihang Second District Further Reduces Wine Workshops
    [This newspaper's Taihang dispatch] In order to continue implementing the work of economizing and preparing for famine, the Second Special District has once again reduced the number of wine workshops in accordance with the different degrees of disaster, in order to save grain and overcome the famine. After the last reduction, there were 29 remaining wineries with a daily output of 2,845 jin of wine. Now, based on discussions regarding the disaster situation, it has been decided to close another 22, including those in Tulingtou in Pingding, Kucheng in Xiyang, Chengguan in Heshun, Jinzang in Yushe, Shibei in Wuxiang, and Xiguan in Zuoquan. The seven remaining wineries are in Chengguan Xiying in Xiangyuan, Hongshui and Duncun in Wuxiang, and Chengguan in Yushe, with a daily output of 715 jin of wine, a reduction of three-quarters compared to the past. From June 25th, when burning was reduced, to July 27th, when changes were made, a total of 32 days, 6,720 jin less of millet were burned each day, totaling a saving of 215,044 jin of millet. After the burning was stopped, over a hundred personnel were streamlined, and most of them turned to agricultural production. The 131 livestock (mules and horses) belonging to the wineries have been formed into a transportation team and turned to sideline production. (Zheng He)
