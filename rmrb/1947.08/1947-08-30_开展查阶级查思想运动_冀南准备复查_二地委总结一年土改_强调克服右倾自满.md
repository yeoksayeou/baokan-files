    Second District Committee Summarizes One Year of Land Reform
  　Emphasizing Overcoming Right-leaning Complacency
    [Report from this newspaper] The Second District Committee of Jinnan summarized one year of land reform and is preparing for a major re-examination. The summary focused on examining right-leaning and complacent thinking among the leadership. When the Gao, Ping, Xia, and En new districts (which at the time still had enemy and puppet remnants) began mass movements, the leadership was afraid that landlords would combine with bandits and puppets to riot, so they first took care of the landlords, leaving them a means of living. Satisfying the demands of poor peasants was put on the back burner, and special agents and bad elements were not strictly suppressed after listening to the opinions of the masses, sticking to the confines of policy. In the old districts of Qing, Wu, Gu, and other counties, landlords were generally left with a middle peasant's standard of living, and even a considerable portion with a rich peasant's standard of living. In this situation, the District Committee issued an instruction last winter (between November and December) saying: "Land reform has been basically completed," calling for "entering a major re-examination and preparing for major production." At that time, the leadership overestimated the achievements, so the major re-examination since this spring has largely failed to materialize. This actually reflected the District Committee's right-leaning and complacent leadership thinking. Reasons for this were examined: (1) In terms of leadership thinking, the historically important task of land reform was seen as too simple and too easy, numbed by the phenomena of major movements, believing that a few major winds would basically solve the problem. It was not recognized that it was an extremely arduous task for peasants who had been ruled for thousands of years to climb out from under the oppression of feudal landlords. The strength of the masses was not seen, the strength of the landlords was overestimated, the reactionary nature of the landlords was not recognized, so the more concessions made, the more incomplete it became, and the more the landlords seized the opportunity to counterattack. (2) The leadership did not thoroughly understand the overall work, sometimes treating superficial phenomena as the essence, local phenomena as the whole, and making hasty conclusions based on inaccurate percentage figures. (3) Blindly rushing for quick results, fearing falling behind, and hearing that other areas had basically completed it, so they forced the issue and called for entering the re-examination to prepare for major production. This actually increased the complacent mood of cadres from top to bottom. (4) The poverty of the poor peasants and the hatred for the landlord class were not deeply felt, so the suffering of the peasants was put on the back burner, and the care, leniency, and attempts to win over the landlords were placed in the foreground. In order to more fully mobilize the masses and completely eliminate feudal remnants, the Second District Committee called on all cadres to earnestly solve ideological problems in the future, deeply recall the rich experience of the past year, examine their positions, viewpoints, and methods, and launch a class investigation and ideological examination movement. It is necessary to overcome blind impatience and seriously recognize the historical significance of land reform. Complacency and relaxation are tantamount to helping the class enemy. At the same time, after each stage of work, it is necessary to continuously oppose complacency and the "good enough" mentality. To achieve the goal of completely eliminating the landlord class.

    二地委总结一年土改
  　强调克服右倾自满
    【本报讯】冀南二地委总结一年土地改革，准备大复查。总结中着重检查了领导上的右倾与自满思想。当高、平、夏、恩新区（当时还有敌伪杂团）开始群运时，领导思想怕地主结合匪伪暴动，因此就先照顾地主，留生活。满足贫农要求便放在后面，对特务坏分子，未听取群众意见严格镇压，拘泥于政策圈子。在老区清、武、故等县，一般地主还都留到中农，甚至不少一部分还留到富农的生活。而在这样情况下，去冬（十一、二月之间）地委曾发指示说：“土地改革已基本完成”，号召“进入大复查，准备大生产”。当时领导上过高的估计了成绩，所以今春以来的大复查大部未搞起来，这实际反映了地委右倾、自满的领导思想。检查原因：（一）领导思想上由于将土改的历史重要任务看得太简单，太容易，为大动现象所麻痹，认为刮几次大风就基本解决问题，没认识到几千年被统治的农民从封建地主压迫下爬出来是件极其艰苦的工作。没看到群众力量，过分夸大地主力量，没认识到地主的反动性，所以越迁就越不彻底，地主就越乘机反攻。（二）领导上没深入了解全面工作，有时将表面现象看成实质，局部现象看成全部，根据不精确数字百分比，就草率做了总结。（三）盲目地操之过急。怕落后，听说别地区基本完成了，于是也牵强附会，号召进入复查准备大生产，这实际增加了干部自上而下的自满情绪。（四）对贫苦农民的穷苦，与对地主阶级仇恨体会不深刻，因而将农民的痛苦放在后面，把对地主之照顾、宽大、争取放在面前。为了更充分发动群众，彻底消灭封建残余，二地委号召所有干部，今后要认真解决思想问题，深刻回忆过去一年丰富的经验，检查立场、观点方法，开展查阶级、查思想运动，要克服盲目的急性病，严肃认识土地改革的历史意义，麻痹松懈，即是帮助了阶级敌人。同时要在每段工作后，连续不断地反自满反差不多等思想。达到彻底消灭地主阶级的目的。
