　　Shexian Organizes Cotton Planting Experts
  　To Guide Cotton Seedling Management in Rural Areas
    [Report from Shexian by this newspaper] In order to organize increased cotton production, the county has specially selected eight or nine village production directors and cotton planting experts from various districts who have experience in cotton management to study ways to strengthen cotton management. It was discovered that cotton in various places generally had not been pruned (打杈), had not had the "oil bars" removed, and had not been topped (去顶). It was decided to establish a cotton guidance team to go to the districts to provide practical guidance. The team was divided into four groups, and practical guidance was provided according to the cotton conditions in each district. In terms of guidance methods, the approach was to first open up a village's situation, and then convene a meeting of base-point labor heroes and mutual aid team leaders to promote the work, with the district production assistant directly helping. After the guidance team arrived in the villages and conducted on-the-spot inspections, the following problems were discovered: (1) Water was carried to plant the cotton sparsely, with plants two steps apart, wasting land. (2) Cotton was planted in bad land. For example, in Taihua Village, Sixth District, cotton was planted in river beach pebble land, and the cotton seedlings could not grow. (3) Most of the cotton was hoed too deeply, and some was not hoed to the cotton roots. For example, in Shangqingliang Village, Ninth District, some cotton seedlings were hoed to death, and some people were afraid of hoeing the roots, so they dared not hoe to the cotton roots. (4) Cotton management was too late; the cotton that should have been topped had not been topped, and the plants had already become exhausted. For example, in Tanli Village, Ninth District, the "oil bars" in the north end of a cotton field grew taller than the cotton plants, and not a single cotton boll had formed. (5) The cotton emerged late and grew small, so it was not worth harvesting. For example, in Dongxiqi Village, Seventh District, the cotton grew small and was not worth harvesting, but the masses were still waiting to harvest the cotton and were not actively changing to other crops. After the guidance team discovered these problems in the villages, each group carried out technical management work according to the actual situation in each district: (1) Holding meetings and doing practical work on the ground, providing practical guidance, played a significant role. For example, in Dongda, Sixth District, the Zhao Juku guidance team led the masses to prune the cotton branches and remove the "oil bars" after explaining and demonstrating on the ground, and the masses all learned how to do it. Before leaving, they also discussed that the cotton field was too hard and had not been hoed enough, and that more hoeing was needed for the cotton to grow. (2) Taking action during the day and persuading at night. Comrade Niuxinhe from the Ninth District guidance team, after being assigned to Nanguan, saw that the masses were busy hoeing the land and that there was no one to hold a meeting, so he personally went to the cotton field to inspect it. He saw that there were many cotton "oil bars" and started pruning them himself. Soon a large group of people gathered around, and the cotton was pruned, and the masses learned how to do it. Everyone unanimously asked him to prune their own land. When he returned to the village for dinner at night, he took his bowl and went to the street food market to promote the work. In this way, by persuading at home at night and taking action on the ground during the day, the cotton in Nanguan, Shangqingliang, and other places was automatically pruned in a few days. (3) It is necessary to combine with district and village cadres to open up the situation. (4) Teach and leave immediately, without delaying production. Because the masses in various villages were rushing to replant autumn vegetables after the rain, it was difficult to hold meetings. In response to this situation, comrades such as Zhang Xueyi from the Seventh District guidance team took a few people to the fields in Hezhang Dongxi＠ Village to experiment, and left after they learned how to do it. They then notified others to go there to learn, and they also discussed methods for replanting autumn vegetables in cotton fields that were too sparse in Dongxi＠. The masses were very happy and said, "In the past, when the cotton grew branches, we were reluctant to prune them, because we thought they would all form cotton bolls." At present, in the whole county, except for the Third, Eighth, and Fourth Districts, where cotton technical management is relatively well-established, the remaining First, Second, Sixth, Seventh, and Ninth Districts have all been divided into groups to promote management. (5) The guidance team proposed the following issues that cotton should pay attention to in the future: 1. Cotton should continue to be managed, with tasks such as topping, pruning, and frequent weeding. 2. If cotton seedlings are small and not worth harvesting, people should be mobilized to plant vegetables. In many cotton fields in the Sixth and Seventh Districts, due to drought and lack of rain, the cotton seedlings have not grown and are only two inches tall now. Because the time is too late for this cotton, it is feared that it will not be worth harvesting, and people should be mobilized to replant. 3. Attention should be paid to the management and recovery of cotton damaged by hail.

　　涉县组织植棉能手
  　下乡指导棉苗管理
    【本报涉县讯】为了组织棉花增产，县里特抽调各区对棉花管理有经验的村生产主任及植棉能手等八九人，研究怎样对棉花加强管理等办法，发现了各地棉花普遍都没有进行打杈，打油条、去顶等，决定成立棉花指导组，下区分别进行实际指导。共划分四组，根据各区棉花情况，分别进行实地指导，在指导方法上，先打开一个村局面后，再召开基点劳英互助组长会议推动，区里由生产助理员直接帮助。指导组到村后实地检查发现以下问题：（一）担水栽花很稀，隔两步栽一棵，浪费地。（二）棉花都种到坏地里。像六区台华村，棉花种到河滩石子地，棉苗都长不起来。（三）棉花大部分锄的太深，还有锄不到棉根等。像九区上清凉等村，有个别棉花被锄死，及恐怕锄坏了，不敢锄到棉花根。（四）棉花管理太迟，该去顶的没有去顶，已抽了劲。像九区滩里村，北头的一块棉花地油条长的比棉花长的还高，一个花桃也不结。（五）棉花出的晚长的小收不回花来。像七区东西岐等村，花长的小收不回来，群众还在等着收花，也不积极改成其他庄稼。经指导组在各村发现这些毛病后，各组即根据各区的实际情况，开展了技术管理工作：（一）召开会议到地实际干，实际指导，起了很大作用。像六区赵巨库指导组在东达领导群众，到地一面讲解一面把花打杈去油条修理后，群众都学会了，临走时，还研究了这块花地太硬锄的太少，应当多锄，才能生长等办法。（二）白天动手黑夜动嘴，九区指导组牛心河同志，分配到南关后，看到群众正忙于锄地，没有人也开不成会，便亲自到棉花地去检查，到地看到棉花油条杈很多，就亲自动手修理，群众不一会围了一大堆，棉花也修理完了，群众也学习会了。都一致要求他到自己地修理，黑夜回村吃饭时就端上碗到街饭市上宣传。这样黑夜在家动嘴，白天到地动手，不几天南关、上清凉等棉花都自动修理起来。（三）必须和区村干部结合，才能打开局面。（四）随来随教学会就走，不耽误生产。由于各村群众雨后正在突击补种秋菜，召开会议困难。像七区指导组张学议等同志，根据这样情况，在合漳东西＠村带上几个人到地里试验，学会了就走。再通知给别人到那里学，并在东西＠研究了棉花太稀补种秋菜等办法。群众很高兴的说：“以前棉花长起枝来俺就舍不得，俺认为都结成哩”。现全县除三、八、四等区棉花技术管理比较有基础外，其余一、二、六、七、九等区都分组进行了推动管理。（五）指导组提出：今后棉花应注意的几个问题：一、棉花要继续管理，打尖去杈勤地等工作。二、棉花苗小收不回来，应发动种菜，在六、七区棉花地里很多由于天旱没雨，花苗都没有长起来到现在才二寸多高，这样棉花，因时间太晚，恐怕收不回来，应发动补种。三、冰雹打伤棉花应注意管理恢复。
