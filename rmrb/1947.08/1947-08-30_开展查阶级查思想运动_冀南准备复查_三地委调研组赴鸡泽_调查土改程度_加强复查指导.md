[News from this newspaper] The Jinnan Third Prefectural Committee, in order to better guide the re-examination, Jiao Di, the secretary of the committee, personally led an investigation group to Jize to conduct investigation and research. The content of the investigation includes: 1. The extent of elimination of feudalism: from the quality of the land, the number and quality of houses, and the daily diet, clothing, and labor to see whether the landlords have diverted materials and underground treasures, and from their attitude towards the basic masses to understand their ideology. 2. The situation of poor peasants turning themselves over: is the distribution of fruits following the poor peasant line or the rich peasant line? How many households have not yet thoroughly turned themselves over? The objects of inspection are mainly comparisons between military dependents, village cadres, militia, activists, and general poor peasants, as well as the demands of the masses who have not thoroughly turned themselves over. 3. The degree of ideological mobilization of the masses: on the one hand, check whether they are resolutely separated from the landlords or are sympathetic and numb, and on the other hand, check how many points of separation are considered in the distribution of fruits and the determination of struggle targets? Whether there is a sense of ownership; in addition, check our policy of uniting the majority from the degree of sympathy, wavering, or fear of the struggle among the middle peasants. 4. Leadership issues: mainly understand the mass line in the past, and study what to do in the future on this basis: (1) What are the difficulties in letting go, why didn't it let go in the past? How to let go in the future? (2) What is the appropriate way to establish poor peasants as the backbone? How to establish it? How to give play to the role of the old organization? How do counties and districts solve and lead this contradiction? In specific practices: combine local county and district cadres with current work. Directly inspect households, have extensive and in-depth conversations with the masses, and let them boldly criticize our policies and cadres at all levels.

    【本报讯】冀南三地委为更好指导复查，焦地书亲率调研组赴鸡泽进行调查研究。调查内容包括：一、封建消灭程度，从土地质量好坏、房屋多少好坏及日常吃饭、穿衣、劳动上看地主是否有疏散物资与地下宝，从其对基本群众的态度上了解其思想。二、赤贫农翻身情况：分果实是贫农路线还是富农路线？有多少户还没翻透身？检查对象主要是军属、村干、民兵、积极分子和一般赤贫农的比较及未翻透身的群众要求。三、群众思想发动程度：一面检查与地主是坚决分家还是怜悯麻痹，一面检查在分果实确定斗争对象等问题上到底当几分家？是否有主人翁思想；另外从中农对斗争的同情、动摇或害怕的程度上检查我们团结大多数政策。四、领导问题：主要了解过去的群众路线，并研究在此基础上今后怎么办：（一）放手有那些困难，过去为啥没放开？今后如何放？（二）树立以贫农为骨干采用什么方式合适？如何树立？怎样发挥旧组织的作用？县区对这一矛盾如何解决与领导？在具体作法上：结合本地县区干部与当前工作。直接挨户检查，与群众进行广泛纵深畅谈，让其大胆批评我们的政策与各级干部。
