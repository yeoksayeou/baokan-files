Comrades:
    Today is the "August 1st" Memorial Day, the 20th anniversary of the birth of our People's Liberation Army, and also the anniversary of the victory of our patriotic self-defense war. Recalling the twenty years of heroic struggle from the Red Army to the People's Liberation Army, I want to talk to you about three issues.
    The first issue: The emergence and development of the Red Army
    Twenty years ago today (August 1, 1927), the Chinese Kuomintang betrayed the nation, betrayed the people, surrendered to imperialism, and carried out a massive slaughter of the people, attempting to usurp and monopolize the fruits of the First Great Revolution. In order to continue the revolution and oppose the Kuomintang's counter-revolutionary actions, the Chinese Communist Party decided that Zhu (De), He (Long), and Ye (Ting) would lead more than 20,000 troops to stage the armed Nanchang Uprising. Later, there were also the Autumn Harvest Peasant Uprising in Hunan, Hubei, and Jiangxi led by Chairman Mao, and the Guangzhou Workers' Uprising. Chairman Mao and Commander-in-Chief Zhu joined forces in the Jinggang Mountains, formally establishing the Workers' and Peasants' Red Army and establishing the Soviet area and the Soviet government. At the First Congress of the Central Soviet Area, it was decided that "August 1st" would be the anniversary of the Red Army. This is the origin of "August 1st".
    At this time, the reactionaries paid even more attention to us. They wanted to eliminate us and, with the help of American, German, French and other imperialists, mobilized a million troops to encircle and suppress us. We smashed them all. The Red Army led by Mao and Zhu alone annihilated more than 100,000 enemies in the Central Soviet Area and seized more than 40,000 rifles. However, due to the mistake of pure defense made by the leadership at the time of the five encirclements and suppressions, the Red Army had to withdraw from the Central Soviet Area after breaking through the enemy's five encirclements. Except for a part of the Red Army that insisted on guerrilla warfare in the eight provinces of southern China and a part that went north to resist Japan, the main force had to withdraw from the Central Soviet Area and began the unprecedented 25,000-li Long March in history. Crossing the natural barrier of the Wujiang River, seizing the Jinsha River, passing through the Yi area, forcing the Dadu River, seizing the Luding Bridge, climbing over the snow-capped mountains, walking through the grasslands... Overcoming all difficulties, the main force of the national Red Army finally joined forces in northern Shaanxi in October 1935.
    On February 20, 1936, the Red Army crossed the Yellow River eastward from northern Shaanxi to resist Japan and punish the rebels. In the autumn, the Red Army issued the famous "August 1st Declaration," calling for a truce and negotiations to unite against Japan, preparing to fully support the Suiyuan Anti-Japanese War.
    On August 21, 1937, the Red Army was reorganized into the Eighth Route Army and vowed to march east into the enemy's rear to launch operations against Japan. In September, it won a beautiful victory in Pingxingguan, annihilating a Japanese brigade, stabilizing the confidence in the Anti-Japanese War, and breaking the fear of Japan and the phenomenon of Kuomintang troops fleeing at the sound of the wind. In October, it burned 24 planes at Yangmingbao Airport, stabilizing the situation in northern Shanxi. From then on, the Eighth Route Army gained great prestige on the North China battlefield and throughout the country. At the same time, the New Fourth Army was established in the south of the Yangtze River, penetrated into the enemy's heart, advanced into Jiangsu and Anhui, and directly approached Nanjing and Shanghai.
    The Eighth Route Army burned like a raging fire in the enemy's rear, mobilizing and organizing the masses everywhere, carrying out guerrilla warfare, attacking the enemy everywhere, recovering vast territories, and gaining a firm foothold. At this time, the Kuomintang launched its first anti-communist upsurge. In the autumn of 1939, it sent stubborn elements such as Zhu Huaibing, Shi Yousan, and Zhang Yinwu to make trouble and create friction in the enemy's rear. In the winter, we could no longer tolerate it and defeated them. However, one wave subsided and another rose. The second anti-communist upsurge came again, and the painful and vengeful Southern Anhui Incident broke out. Taking us by surprise, the Kuomintang army surrounded the headquarters of our New Fourth Army, captured Commander Ye Ting, killed our Deputy Commander Xiang Ying, and canceled the designation of the New Fourth Army. But it did not frighten us. Chairman Mao supported the New Fourth Army and immediately reorganized several detachments into seven divisions to persist in the anti-Japanese war in the enemy's rear in the south of the Yangtze River.
    Later, the environment in the enemy's rear became increasingly difficult. The enemy implemented continuous large-scale mopping-up operations and the cruel "three-all policy" of killing all, burning all, and looting all, gradually eroding the base areas. We shattered the enemy's mopping-up operations and opposed the enemy's "three-all policy" and "nibbling policy," established a large number of armed work teams, and marched towards the "enemy's rear of the enemy's rear." We implemented "streamlining troops and simplifying administration," launched a rectification movement to transform the ideology and work style of the entire party, unite the entire party and the entire country, launched rent reduction and interest reduction, and the army and civilians worked together to overcome floods, droughts, and locust plagues, improve the people's fighting spirit, establish local armed forces, and develop a large number of militia, implement unified leadership, and overcome the enemy's total war. We launched a large-scale military and civilian production campaign, with the army solving three months of food supply by itself, and helping the local masses with production. We launched large-scale training campaigns, the new heroism movement, the support-the-government-and-cherish-the-people movement, and the love-the-soldiers-and-respect-the-cadres movement. We implemented Chairman Mao's call to vigorously expand the liberated areas, capture strongholds, annihilate the enemy and puppet troops, and prepare for a large-scale counter-offensive. The entire army quickly transformed into a regular army.
    On August 11, 1945, Japan announced its unconditional surrender. During the eight years of the Anti-Japanese War, the blood and sweat of our Eighth Route Army, New Fourth Army, and Northeast Anti-Japanese Volunteer Army were not shed in vain, and we finally achieved victory. During the eight years, the Japanese invaders wanted to eliminate it, but they did not eliminate it; the Kuomintang wanted to eliminate it, but they did not eliminate it even more. Instead, it developed itself and strengthened itself. The liberated areas were also greatly expanded. At this time, our Party Central Committee issued a declaration on August 25, stating that the Anti-Japanese War had been won and the period of peaceful nation-building was about to begin. In order to consolidate the victory and strive for peace, it put forward six demands: "Requesting the National Government to recognize the elected governments and people's armies in the liberated areas, allow them to participate in accepting Japan's surrender, severely punish traitors and puppet troops, fairly and rationally reorganize the army, guarantee the people's freedoms and rights, and establish a democratic coalition government." Then Chairman Mao personally flew to Chongqing and signed the "Double Tenth Agreement." Our army painfully withdrew from the eight liberated areas south of the Yangtze River. However, the Kuomintang still did not stop and took an inch, mobilizing a large army, mighty and unstoppable, continuously going north along the Pinghan, Tongpu, and Jinpu railway lines to attack us. In order to defend the fruits of the victory of the Anti-Japanese War, we had to launch a resolute counterattack, and successively achieved great victories in Shangdang and Handan in about a month. Under the three conditions of self-defense victory, domestic and foreign democratic pressure, and the Kuomintang's internal division, the Kuomintang was forced to sign a "ceasefire order." After signing, our army resolutely implemented it. Little did they know that Chiang Kai-shek, with the assistance of American imperialism, took the opportunity to transport a large number of troops to Nanjing, Shanghai, Beijing, Tianjin, and Northeast China, destroy the ceasefire agreement, and mobilize 300,000 troops in an attempt to encircle and annihilate our Central Plains Military Region led by Li Xiannian, drive away the New Fourth Army in central China, eliminate the Eighth Route Army in North China, firmly control North China, open up Northeast China, and realize his fascist dictatorial dream of unifying China.
    But they failed. Although we had a period of peace after the victory of the Anti-Japanese War, we underestimated the traitor Chiang Kai-shek and suffered some losses. However, we quickly eliminated the illusions of peace, and the soldiers and civilians in all liberated areas mobilized unanimously to launch a heroic and just patriotic self-defense war against Chiang Kai-shek's policy of selling out the country, dictatorship, and civil war. In the past year, we annihilated 100 enemy brigades, killing, wounding, and capturing 1,120,000 enemy troops. (Editor's note: Detailed battle results are omitted, see this newspaper on the 31st of last month)
    This is our brilliant achievement in the past year. Among them, the East China region is the first in terms of combat achievements, and our region is the second. Especially since our Liu and Deng armies launched a counter-offensive in July, they have annihilated nine and a half enemy brigades, killing, wounding, and capturing 60,100 enemy troops in just 21 days. This shows the truth that our initiative has greatly increased and our army is becoming stronger and stronger.
  Second issue: Several experiences and lessons of our party's army building in the past twenty years
    In the past twenty years, our army has grown, developed, and become stronger in struggle. From the above simple review, we have gained the following experiences and lessons:
    (1) The People's Liberation Army can achieve today's achievements because since the day it was born, it has been under the correct leadership of our Chinese Communist Party, which has been tempered for 26 years and has become a great, mature, and experienced party. Since the Autumn Harvest Uprising and the joining of forces of the Zhu-Mao Red Army in Jinggangshan in 1937, it has been under the leadership of the great leader of the Chinese people, Chairman Mao. It bravely defeated the brutal attacks and encirclements of the various imperialists who helped Chiang Kai-shek's Kuomintang during the ten years of the land revolution. During the eight years of the Anti-Japanese War, it bravely and tenaciously persisted behind enemy lines, created large liberated areas, strengthened itself, and thoroughly achieved the victory of the Anti-Japanese War. In the self-defense war in the past year, it has achieved the most brilliant victory. Without the leadership of the Party and without the leadership of Chairman Mao, our army could not have achieved such great achievements today.
    (2) The People's Liberation Army can achieve today's achievements because it is the product of the Chinese people's revolution and is the people's army. It has highly demonstrated the quality of "coming from the people, belonging to the people, and serving the people." It is as loyal to the people as a son is to his mother. It is an army led by the proletariat that is anti-imperialist and anti-feudal and serves the people wholeheartedly. It abides by the "Three Main Rules of Discipline and Eight Points for Attention" personally formulated by Chairman Mao. Red Army commanders and fighters should all learn three skills: "know how to fight, know how to raise funds, and know how to do mass work." It is the basic idea of building a people's army, so the broad masses of the people love it, help it, overcome all difficulties, and constantly gain consolidation, development, and growth in an extremely difficult struggle environment.
    (3) The People's Liberation Army can achieve today's achievements because we have established various excellent systems in the army, first of all, the political work system and the political commissar system, the staff work system, the confidential work system, the supply work system, the health work system, military industrial construction, communications construction, school construction, etc. Since the implementation of the Party's unified leadership, the Party's leadership over the army has been further strengthened, and the unity between officers and soldiers and the unity between the army and the people have been further strengthened. This has further promoted the glorious tradition of hard struggle and heroic struggle.
    (4) The People's Liberation Army can achieve today's achievements because our Party has patiently carried out class and national education in the army, universally improved the political consciousness of all commanders and fighters, and consolidated their discipline and combat effectiveness. This has enabled our commanders and fighters to often show a fearless and unparalleled heroic spirit when fighting with the enemy.
    At the same time, in the movement of serving the people, making contributions to the people, and developing new heroism, we have cultivated thousands of heroes and models, and trained and preserved many outstanding leaders in military and political work and a large number of excellent cadres. These talents are not only the backbone of the army, but also the most valuable treasures of the entire Party and the entire country.
    (5) The People's Liberation Army can achieve today's achievements because it has grown from nothing, from small to large, from weak to strong, from guerrilla force to regular army, from illegal to legal. In particular, it has transformed from guerrilla warfare to the current large-scale regular operations, capable of annihilating two enemy brigades in one battle group, annihilating seven enemy brigades at once, annihilating nine and a half enemy brigades in 20 days, and annihilating 100 enemy brigades in a year, creating a new record in Chinese military history. This has laid the foundation for the independence of the motherland and the success of the people's liberation movement. As long as we dare to win, we will surely win.
    (6) The People's Liberation Army can achieve today's achievements because it has increasingly learned the guerrilla warfare and the military guiding line of annihilating the enemy created by Chairman Mao. It not only knows how to fight small guerrilla warfare and sparrow warfare, but also learns how to fight large-scale mountain guerrilla warfare, especially plain guerrilla warfare, during the eight years of the Anti-Japanese War. It not only learns how to seize "mobile warfare under favorable conditions" to annihilate the enemy, but also learns how to concentrate superior forces in campaigns and tactics, implement large-scale mobility, not care about the gains and losses of one city and one place, not fight the enemy head-on, but actively seek and create the enemy's weaknesses, and use five, six, or even ten times more troops than the enemy to annihilate one enemy regiment or battalion, not fight a war of attrition without assurance, and must fight a war of annihilation with assurance, that is, be able to win every battle. We must use wisdom to fight, learn two sets of skills, issue orders to our own troops, and also learn to issue orders to the enemy, mobilizing the enemy so that the enemy must obey our orders. For example, during the 25,000-li Long March, we mobilized the enemy like leading an ox, making it go from south to north, and from north to south. When we didn't want it, we threw it away like a worn-out shoe. In the recent July campaign, we mobilized the enemies in northern Henan and Shandong, making them lose sight of one another and being annihilated at both ends.
    (7) The People's Liberation Army can achieve today's achievements because we have carried out a resolute struggle on two fronts within the army and the Party, and thoroughly eliminated the right-leaning opportunism, warlordism, and banditry of the traitors Chen Duxiu and Zhang Guotao. We have also opposed Li Lisan's blind actionism and the military adventurism of the Jiangxi Soviet Area era. We have waged a cruel struggle against all counter-revolutionaries hiding in our army, such as AB groups, Trotskyites, social democrats, enemy spies, KMT spies, and Japanese spies, ensuring the ideological unity and solidarity of the army and the Party.
    (8) The People's Liberation Army can achieve today's achievements because we have established and consolidated revolutionary base areas. In the ten years of land reform struggle, we created multiple Soviet areas, which enabled the Red Army to develop to more than 300,000 troops. In the eight years of the Anti-Japanese War, we created multiple liberated areas, which enabled the Eighth Route Army and the New Fourth Army to develop to more than one million troops. The great victory we have achieved in the self-defense war in the past year is also due to the vast and interconnected liberated areas. An army must have a base area, and a base area must have an army. We started from scratch. He Long started with a kitchen knife, and the Hubei-Henan-Anhui region started with three and a half guns. Now that we have a rear area, it is of great help to the revolution. This has formed a new record in the history of the Chinese revolution of having a position and a rear area for development.
    (9) The People's Liberation Army can achieve today's achievements because it has been tempered and strengthened in the struggle of the past twenty years. Although it still has its weaknesses, weapons are still not sufficient, Japanese and American weapons are not many enough, combat experience is still not rich enough, and the supply of military needs, military medicine, communications equipment, etc., still cannot be completely self-sufficient, and the long-term combat environment, the political level of the troops, and the training of military technology are still not completely satisfactory. However, in the twenty years of struggle, it has proven that this people's army is an army that cannot be broken, cannot be dragged down, can conquer everything, and is indestructible. Japanese imperialism cannot eliminate us, American imperialism cannot eliminate us either, and Chiang Kai-shek's reactionaries cannot eliminate us even more. It is the pillar of our Party, the mainstay of the revolution, and the force with decisive significance in guaranteeing the victory of the Chinese revolution. Chairman Mao said: "Without armed forces, there would be no position for the Chinese proletariat, and the Chinese revolution would not be able to move forward." "Establishing armed forces is the most basic link in establishing a base area. Without this thing or if it has no power, all problems are out of the question."
    (10) Finally, we are not fighting alone, so we can achieve today's achievements. The international and domestic political situation is in our favor, and we can indirectly obtain the support of international and domestic democratic forces, the assistance of the international proletariat, and the sympathy of the national liberation movements in colonies and semi-colonies, especially the rapid recovery and unlimited strength of the Soviet economy. We have been influenced by socialism and absorbed many valuable experiences in the construction of the Red Army.
    In short, the People's Liberation Army, in terms of its class, belongs to the workers and peasants; in terms of its political quality, it is absolutely loyal to the Chinese national democratic revolution, loyal to class liberation, loyal to national independence, loyal to the people, and loyal to the Party; in terms of combat, it is intelligent and brave, and can skillfully and stubbornly defeat the enemy under any difficult circumstances.
    This army has always been nurtured with great care by our Bolshevik Party Central Committee, especially with the direct concern and guidance of our Party's great leader, Chairman Mao, so that it can grow and strengthen in the broad revolutionary movement of the masses, and be tempered and consolidated under the countless "encirclements and suppressions" of the enemy. Confidence in victory must be increased.
  Third issue: Commemorating August 1st
    The current task is to build this People's Liberation Army more perfect and stronger, and to complete the tasks entrusted to it by history.
    (1) Unite all the soldiers and civilians in the liberated areas, develop the just patriotic self-defense war, and resolutely, thoroughly, completely, and entirely eliminate all Chiang Kai-shek's invading troops and other sixteen slogans (issued by the CPC Central Committee on July 7th), and strive to fully realize them.
    (2) Commemorate August 1st, pay tribute to the People's Liberation Army, and pay tribute to the militia guerrillas. The entire army is fully prepared for a large-scale counter-offensive!
    (3) Commemorate August 1st, pay tribute to the great leader of the Chinese people, Chairman Mao! Pay tribute to Commander-in-Chief Zhu!
    Long live the People's Liberation Army!
    Long live Chairman Mao!
    Long live Commander-in-Chief Zhu!
    Long live the liberation of the Chinese nation!

### 英勇奋斗的二十年——滕副司令员在军区人民解放军二十周年纪念会上的讲话

    英勇奋斗的二十年
    ——滕副司令员在军区人民解放军二十周年纪念会上的讲话同志们：
    今天是“八一”纪念日，是我人民解放军二十周年的生日，也是我们进行爱国自卫战争胜利的周年。我回忆从红军到人民解放军英勇斗争的二十年，我要向同志们讲三个问题。
    第一个问题：红军的产生及其发展
    二十年前的今天（一九二七年八月一日），中国国民党背叛民族，背叛人民，投降了帝国主义，对人民实行大屠杀，想把第一次大革命的胜利果实篡夺独吞。中国共产党为了把革命继续贯彻下去，反对国民党的反革命行动，决定朱（德）、贺（龙）、叶（挺）率部两万余人在南昌举行武装起义。后来又有毛主席领导的湘、鄂、赣秋收农民暴动，广州的工人暴动。毛主席和朱总司令在井岗山上会了师，正式成立了工农红军，建立了苏区，成立了苏维埃政权。中央苏区召开第一次大会时，决定“八一”为红军诞辰。这就是“八一”的由来。
    这时反动派对我们更加注意了。它想消灭我们，取得美、德、法等帝国主义的帮助，调动百万大军，对我围剿。我们都把它们粉碎了。仅毛、朱带的红军在中央苏区就歼灭了敌人十几万，缴了四万多条枪。但是由于五次围剿时，当时的领导上犯了单纯防御的错误，牛抵角，突破敌人五次围剿后，除以一部坚持江南八省游击战争，一部北上抗日外，其主力不得不退出中央苏区，开始了历史上亘古未有的二万五千里长征。渡过乌江天险，夺取金沙江，通过猓猓区，强渡大渡河，抢过泸定桥，爬过雪山，走过草地………克服一切困难，到了一九三五年十月，全国红军主力才在陕北会师。
    一九三六年二月二十日，红军由陕北东渡黄河，抗日讨逆。秋天红军发表了有名的“八一宣言”停战议和一致抗日，准备全力援助绥远抗战。
    一九三七年八月二十一日，由红军改编为八路军，誓师东进深入敌后，展开对日作战。九月，在平型关打了一个漂亮胜仗，消灭日寇一个旅，稳定了抗日信心，打破了恐日病及国民党军队闻风而逃的现象。十月，又烧了阳明堡飞机场二十四架飞机，稳定了晋北战局。从此八路军在华北战场及全国声威大震。同时江南成立了新四军，插进敌人心脏，挺进苏皖，直迫京沪。
    八路军像烈火一样在敌后燃烧开来，到处发动与组织群众，开展游击战争，处处打击敌人，收复了广大国土，站稳了脚根。这时国民党来了个第一次反共高潮，三九年秋派朱怀冰、石友三、张荫梧等顽固分子来敌后捣乱磨擦。冬天，我们忍无可忍，把它打垮。但是一波未息，一波又起，第二次反共高潮又来了，爆发了亲痛仇快的皖南事变，乘我不备国民党军队把我新四军军部包围，捉走了叶挺军长，打死了我项英副军长，取消了新四军的番号。但是没有把我们吓倒，毛主席给新四军撑腰，马上把几个支队改编为七个师，坚持江南敌后抗战。
    后来敌后环境一天天艰苦，敌人对我实行连续的大扫荡和残酷的杀光、烧光、抢光的“三光政策”，蚕食根据地。我们就粉碎敌人扫荡反对敌人“三光政策”、“蚕食政策”，大量建立了武工队，向“敌后之敌后”进军。实行“精兵简政”，展开全党改造思想、改造作风、团结全党、团结全国的整风运动，发动减租减息，军民同命战胜水灾、旱灾、蝗灾，提高人民斗争情绪，建立地方武装，大量发展民兵，实行一元化领导，战胜了敌人的总力战。开展军民大生产运动，军队自己解决三个月粮食，帮助驻地群众生产。开展大练兵运动、新英雄主义、拥政爱民、爱兵尊干等运动。执行毛主席猛烈扩大解放区、攻克据点歼灭敌伪准备大反攻的号召，全军迅速向正规军转变。
    一九四五年八月十一日，日本宣布无条件投降。抗日八年当中，我八路军、新四军以及东北义勇军的血汗没有白流，终于取得了胜利。八年当中，日寇想消灭它，没有消灭了；国民党想消灭它，更没有消灭了。它反而发展了自己，壮大了自己。解放区也大大扩大。这时我党中央八月二十五日发表了宣言，说明抗战已经胜利，和平建国时期即将开始，为巩固胜利争取和平，提出六项主张：“要求国民政府承认解放区的民选政府与人民军队，允许他们参加接受日本投降，并严惩汉奸伪军，公平合理的整编军队，保障人民的自由权利及成立民主的联合政府。”接着毛主席亲飞重庆，签订“双十协定”，我军忍痛退出江南八个解放区。但国民党仍然不一而足，得寸进尺，调动大军，浩浩荡荡，沿平汉、同蒲、津浦几条铁路干线源源北上向我进攻。我为保卫抗日胜利果实，不能不举行坚决的回击，遂在一月左右取得上党、邯郸两大胜利，在自卫胜利、国内外民主压力、国民党内部分化三个条件下，国民党被迫签订了“停战命令”。签订后，我军坚决执行，殊不知蒋介石在美帝国主义的协助下，乘隙大量运兵京、沪、平、津与东北，破坏停战协定，调动了三十万大兵企图围歼我中原军区李先念部队，赶走华中新四军，消灭华北八路军确掌华北，打通东北，实现其法西斯独裁统一中国的美梦。
    但是他们失败了。抗战胜利后，我们虽曾闹了一个时期的和平，对卖国贼蒋介石估计不足，受了一些损失，但是很快的就肃清了和平幻想，各解放区军民一致动员起来，为反对蒋介石卖国独裁内战政策，展开了英勇的正义的爱国自卫战争，一年以来，歼敌一百个旅，毙伤俘敌一百一十二万人。（编者按：详细战果从略，见上月三十一日本报）
    这是我们一年来的辉煌战果，一年当中论战绩华东第一，我区是第二，尤其我刘、邓大军七月反攻作战以来，仅以二十一天的功夫，即消灭了敌人九个半旅，毙伤俘敌六万零一百余人，这显示我之主动大增和我军愈战愈强之真理。
  第二个问题：二十年我党建军的几点经验教训
    二十年来，我军在斗争中生长发展壮大起来，从以上简单的回忆里，得到以下几点经验教训：
    （一）人民解放军能有今天的成绩，是因为自它产生的那天起，便有我们经过二十六年的锻炼、已经成伟大的成熟的老练的政党——中国共产党的正确领导，从一九三七年秋收暴动朱毛红军会师井岗山起，便在伟大的中国人民领袖毛主席领导之下。它曾在土地革命的十年斗争中，英勇的击败了各个帝国主义帮助蒋介石国民党的残酷进攻和围剿。在抗日的八年中，更英勇顽强的坚持敌后，创立了大块解放区，壮大了自己，彻底取得了抗日战争的胜利。在一年自卫战争中，又取得了最光辉的胜利。如果没有党的领导，没有毛主席的领导，那么，我军就不能获有今天这样伟大的成绩。
    （二）人民解放军能有今天的成绩，是因为它是中国人民革命的产儿是人民的军队，它高度发挥了“来自人民，属于人民，为了人民”的素质。它像儿子忠于母亲一样的忠实于人民。它是反帝反封建的无产阶级领导的，全心全意为人民服务的军队。它遵从毛主席手订的“三大纪律，八项注意”，红军指战员应该人人学会三件本事：“会打仗、会筹款、会做群众工作”，建设人民军队的基本思想，所以广大的人民爱护它，帮助它，克服一切困难，在极端艰苦斗争环境中，不断的获得巩固发展与壮大起来。
    （三）人民解放军能有今天的成绩，是因为我们已经在军队中建立各种优良的制度，首先是政治工作制度，和政治委员制度，参谋工作制度，机要工作制度，供给工作制度，卫生工作制度，军工建设，通讯建设，学校建设等等。自实行党的一元化领导之后，更加加强了党对军队的领导，更加密切了官兵一致，军民一致，这样更发挥了艰苦奋斗，英勇奋斗的光荣传统。
    （四）人民解放军能有今天的成绩，是因为我们党在军队中，耐心的进行了阶级的、民族的教育，普遍提高了全体指战员的政治觉悟，巩固了他的纪律和战斗力，这就使我们的指战员在与敌人搏斗时，常常显出奋不顾身的无畏的无比的英雄气概。
    同时在为人民服务，为人民立功，发展新英雄主义的运动中，我们培养出了成千成万的英雄模范锻炼和保存了许多出色的军事政治工作的领导者和大批优秀的干部。这些人才，不光是军队的骨干，而且是全党全国的至宝。
    （五）人民解放军能有今天的成绩，是因为它由无而有，由小而大，由弱而强，由游击队而正规军，由不合法而合法，特别是它由游击战争转变到现在的大规模的正规作战，能一个兵团一次歼敌二个旅，能一次歼灭敌军七个旅，能于廿天歼敌九个半旅，能一年歼敌一百个旅，创造了中国军事史上的新纪录，这就替祖国的独立和人民解放运动的成功奠定了基础，只要我们敢于胜利，就一定能胜利。
    （六）人民解放军能有今天的成绩，是因为日益学会了毛主席所创造的游击战争，与歼敌的军事指导路线，不仅会打小的游击战、麻雀战，更会在抗日的八年中学会打大规模的山地游击战，特别是平原游击战；不仅学会抓住“有利条件下的运动战”歼灭敌人，并且学会在战役上战术上，能集中优势兵力，实行宽大机动，不计一城一地得失，不和敌人牛抵角，而能积极寻找和创造敌人弱点，以优于敌人五、六倍乃至十倍之兵力，歼敌一个团、一个营，不打无把握的消耗仗，必打有把握的歼灭战即能每战必胜。我们必须用智慧作战，学会两套本领，对自己部队下命令，也学会向敌人下命令，调动敌人使敌人必须服从我们的命令。如二万五千里长征中，我们调动敌人像牵牛一样，使它由南而北，由北而南，我们不愿要的时候，像扔破鞋一样的把它甩掉了。最近七月作战，我们调动了豫北和山东敌人，使它顾此失彼，两头被歼。
    （七）人民解放军能有今天的成绩，是因为我们曾在军队党内进行了坚决的两条战线的斗争，彻底肃清了叛徒陈独秀、张国焘的右倾机会主义，军阀主义，土匪主义。也反对了李立三的盲动主义和江西苏区时代的军事冒险主义，我们会和一切隐匿在我军中的一切反革命，如ＡＢ团托派、社会民主党、敌探奸细、国特日特，进行了惨酷的斗争，保证了军队党思想一致，团结一致。
    （八）人民解放军能有今天的成绩，是因为我们曾建立和巩固了革命的根据地，在十年土地改革斗争中，创立了多块的苏区，才能使红军发展到三十多万。在八年的抗日战争中，创立了多块的解放区，才能使八路军新四军发展到一百万以上。在近一年来自卫战争中能获得这样巨大的胜利，也是由于有了广大的联成一片的解放区，有军队要有根据地，有根据地要有军队。我们是白手起家，贺龙一把菜刀起家，鄂豫皖三条半枪起家，现在有了后方，对革命帮助很大。这在中国革命历史上形成有阵地的有后方的发展一个新的纪录。
    （九）人民解放军能有今天的成绩，是因为它在二十年来的斗争中锻炼壮大起来的，虽然还有他的弱点，武器还不够用，日械、美械亦还不多，战斗经验还感不够丰富，军需、军医、通讯器材等供应，均还不能完全自给自足，以及长期处于战斗环境，部队的政治水平，军事技术的训练，仍嫌不能完全令人满意，但在二十年的斗争中，证明了这支人民的军队：是打不烂、拖不垮、无攻不克、无坚不摧的军队，日本帝国主义不能消灭我们，美帝国主义同样不能消灭我们，蒋介石反动派更不能消灭我们，它是我们党的支柱，是革命的中坚，是保证中国革命胜利的具有决定意义的力量。毛主席说过：“没有武装就没有中国无产阶级的地位，中国革命想前进一步都是不行的。”“建立武装部队是建立根据地最基本的一环，没有这个东西或有了而无力量，一切问题都无从说起”。
    （十）最后，我们不是孤军奋斗，所以才获有今天的成绩，国际上与国内的政治形势均对我有利，间接的可以获得国际上和国内民主力量的声援，有国际无产阶级的援助，殖民地半殖民地的民族解放运动的同情，特别是苏联经济的迅速恢复，力量的无限强大，受了社会主义的影响和吸收了红军建设上许多宝贵的经验。
    总之，人民解放军就其阶级而言，是工人和农民的；就其政治质量而言，是绝对忠实于中国的民族民主革命，忠实于阶级解放，忠实于民族独立，忠实于人民，忠实于党的；就对战斗而言，是智勇兼备，在任何艰苦困难的环境之下，也能够巧好的顽强的去战胜敌人。
    这支军队，曾一贯为我们布尔什维克党中央爱护备至地加以培养，特别是有我们党的伟大领袖毛主席的直接关心与指导，方才在广大的群众的革命运动中生长和壮大起来，方才在敌人无数次的“围剿”之下锻炼和巩固起来。对于胜利的信心必须增加。
  第三个问题：纪念八一
    当前的任务是：要求把这支人民解放军建设得更完善、更坚强，完成历史上所赋予的任务。
    （一）全解放区军民团结起来，发展正义的爱国自卫战争，坚决彻底干脆全部地消灭一切蒋介石进犯军等十六个口号（中共中央七七发布），力求全部实现。
    （二）纪念八一，向人民解放军致敬，向民兵游击队致敬，全军全力准备大反攻！
    （三）纪念八一，向中国人民的伟大领袖毛主席致敬！向朱总司令致敬！
    人民解放军万岁！
    毛主席万岁！
    朱总司令万岁！
    中华民族解放万岁！
