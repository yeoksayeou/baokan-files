  　Establishes Cadre Dependents' Girls' School
    [This Newspaper reports] The North China Xinhua Bookstore has a group of young female comrades (all cadre family members) who have attained a higher elementary school education level. If they were to participate in work now, they would face some difficulties, and their personal progress would not be rapid. If they were to attend school, the public could not provide for them entirely. If they were simply dependents, relying on production to maintain their livelihood every day, it would affect their personal prospects. Based on the principles of reducing the burden on the people, raising the cultural and political level of these comrades, and cultivating independent work abilities, a half-work, half-study girls' school was officially established on August 2nd. Each person is subsidized with 50 catties of millet per month by the public; the remaining expenses are covered by their own production. It is determined that there will be six hours of study and four hours of production each day. The school is equipped with a principal and director (both concurrently held by cadres), and each subject is also taught by bookstore cadres concurrently. The plan is to raise the cultural level to the middle school level within one to two years, to learn general work skills, and to cultivate them into bookstore cadres. If they still cannot work independently, they will also learn self-reliant living skills. (Ti Zhao)

　　新华书店
  　成立干属女校
    【本报讯】华北新华书店，有一批青年妇女同志（均系干部家属）都有了高小文化程度，如现在参加工作，也有些困难，同时个人进步不会快，如让其上学，公家亦不能全部供给，如果单单做家属，每日靠生产维持生活，又影响了个人的前途。在减轻人民负担，提高这些同志的文化政治水平，培养独立工作能力的原则下，特于八月二日正式成立半工半读的女子学校，每人每月由公家补助小米五十斤，其余开支，自己生产解决。确定每日有六小时的学习，四小时生产。校内设有校长主任各一人（由干部兼）各门功课亦由书店干部分兼。计划在一年到二年的时间内，文化要提高到中学程度，能学有一般的工作能力，培养成书店的干部，如其还不能独立工作，也要学会完全自力更生的生活技能。（体昭）
