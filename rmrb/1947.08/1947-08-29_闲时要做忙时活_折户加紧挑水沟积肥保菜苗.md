　　Do busy work in slack time
  　Zhehu speeds up ditch digging, manure accumulation, and vegetable seedling protection
    [This newspaper's Xingtai dispatch] After a thorough rain in Zhehu Village, Ninth District, watering the seedlings has temporarily stopped, but people generally feel that they cannot survive without watering. XXX said on the opera stage: "After this rain, we can take a break!" After discovering the masses' laxity, hero Li Shunhua convened a cadre meeting to discuss how to break the three periods of tight and loose farm work of previous years, and proposed: "Do busy work in slack time." After discussion, ten major plans were formulated: mainly to protect vegetable seedlings and compost manure, incidentally digging ditches and weeding. The slogans are: "Accumulating manure is like accumulating gold, everyone quickly makes manure, three workdays per mu, can save sixty jin of sesame cakes!" "Vegetable bran for half a year's food, autumn vegetables are better than bran, protect one mu of vegetables, can replace one shi of grain!" "More weeding, more fertilizer application (topdressing), diligent insect catching, autumn vegetables will definitely have a good harvest!" A movement to protect vegetables and make fertilizer has now been launched. Li Shunhua's group of fourteen people will make four hundred and twenty dan; Jin Liuyun's group, each laborer (twenty-six people) will make one mu, a total of one thousand three hundred dan; Yao Dezhu alone will make one hundred dan, and Li Deren has made fifteen dan in more than half a day. According to the twelve groups in the village, it is estimated that more than five thousand dan of fertilizer can be made. All ninety-two mu of radish vegetables in the village are completely protected. Yao Zhongren caught more than a thousand black moth larvae in the white radish field in the morning; all the ditches in the sloping dry land have been repaired. Now the men are weeding radishes, making fertilizer, and weeding the seedlings three or four times during the day, watching badgers at night, and the children are watching birds and catching vegetable worms, "changing looseness to tightness." (Zeng Zhang)
    [This newspaper's Xiangyuan dispatch] At a general meeting of the mutual aid group in Shang? Cong Village, First District, to discuss the production plan for wheat planting this year, the group members discussed how much manure should be applied to the wheat fields this year. Group member Wei Wenshan said: "Speaking of applying manure, this year is really a big difficulty. Sheep manure cannot be bought, and bean cake and sesame fertilizer are also very scarce, and everyone has no way." Shen Sanyuan said: "I say it is not difficult, as long as everyone works hard. People often say: if you want to plant, wheat must be smoked; now there is no shortage of wormwood and thorns, as long as you start cutting and smoking, you will see how good it is to plant wheat!" Everyone agreed, and said that at least forty dan of manure should be applied to each mu of wheat field this year. They started the next day, and after three days of statistics, a total of eighteen dan of thorns were cut, and three caves were filled with a total of one hundred and sixty-five dan. The cadres immediately broadcasted praise in the village, influencing and promoting seventeen people including Zhang Jucai to participate. After four days of statistics, a total of two hundred dan of thorns were cut, calculated at eight dan per dan, a total of one hundred and sixty dan were smoked, and together with Shen Sanyuan's group, a total of one thousand seven hundred and sixty-five dan of manure were smoked. On the 15th of this month, a meeting of mutual aid group leaders in the whole village was held to discuss how to accumulate fertilizer and how much manure should be applied to the wheat fields this year. Everyone said: "We must learn from Shen Sanyuan's group and apply forty dan per mu of wheat field, and cut wormwood and thorns for smoking manure." Now all eighteen mutual aid groups in the village have participated in the manure accumulation movement. (Wang Zhi, Jin Mu, Bao Jun, Si Lin, Zhong Bao)
