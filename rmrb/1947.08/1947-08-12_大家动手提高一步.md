　　Everyone Takes Action to Improve a Step Further
　　The News and Literary Awards for June and July of this newspaper have been selected: They include 13 pieces of work, including work research, work experience, news correspondence, and reports and sketches of war and production, land reform movement scenes, and heroic figures. The common characteristic of these news correspondences and literary creations is that they "can solve a problem or explain a problem clearly." They can give readers a clear impression through the report and depiction of a fact or a person, and have strong guidance and inspiration, which is worthy of research and promotion.
　　In terms of news reporting: Comrade Yang Shangfeng of the Taihang Administrative Office, through full investigation and research while participating in the production inspection team, proposed "how to turn activists in the land investigation movement into activists in the production movement," solving an important issue in the transition from land reform to the large-scale production movement. Comrade Liu Cun, starting from reflecting typical examples, introduced the process of how the liberated hero Liang Madou was elected as a production model worker from a land investigation activist, providing a living example for liberated peasants in the entire region to continue to perform meritorious service in production. Comrade Xing Chongzhi of the First District Committee of She County, using the facts of his own work experience, reported on how grassroots cadres use the leadership method of going deep into creating typical examples to promote the overall situation, solving a long-term problem in the leadership methods of county and district cadres. This method of "writing whatever you do," summarizing and upgrading the experience in your work, as well as the richness in content and simplicity in writing, are all worth promoting and learning.
　　In terms of literary creation: Comrade Gu Weijin's "Twisted My Dad's Brain" profoundly portrays how a liberated peasant activist staunchly and unyieldingly carries out class struggle with his father. Comrade Wu Linquan's "Wang Dianwen Returns Home" vividly writes about the awakening and upward spirit of a pair of new peasant couples in the liberation struggle and the self-defense war. Comrade Zeng Ke's "An Old Hero's Determination" vividly writes about the enthusiasm of the people to actively participate in the patriotic self-defense war. The above works have all given the masses good examples. Moreover, Comrade Hu Zheng's "Forcing the Yellow River Crossing" timely tells everyone about a major event of concern, giving readers great encouragement. In addition, these works also make good use of forms such as sketches and reports to quickly reflect the current reality. We feel that the current reality is developing rapidly, and it is worth promoting to seize the opportunity to use reports, sketches, or stories to quickly reflect this changing reality. We hope to receive more short and refined creations reflecting the rich reality in war, production, and land reform in the future.
　　In this selection, it is worth mentioning that the proportion of news is not large enough, and there are not many good news reports that can report on the development process of a problem and have strong guidance, especially the lack of exciting news reflecting the production movement. This shows that we need to make further efforts in news writing. How to write news? How to write good news? We need to strengthen learning and earnestly improve in news reporting! Here we would like to put forward a few suggestions for encouragement: First, promote the style of investigation and research, go deep into reality, and analyze problems realistically. If we want to avoid "empty propaganda," we "need to master materials, deliberate and analyze," "study what is written, and be beneficial to the people," and earnestly raise and solve problems. Avoid using force evenly, saying everything, and not explaining anything clearly. The spirit of Comrade Yang Shangfeng and others is worth further promotion. Second, be good at selecting typical examples for continuous reporting. She County arranged a production meritorious service movement around "July 1st," and from the county office to the district, attention was paid to the continuous reporting of this movement. The first, fourth, fifth, eighth, and ninth districts all did very well. Comrade Xing Chongzhi, secretary of the First District Committee, relied on the Shentou grassroots point as a typical example to continuously report on the branch meritorious service model movement, reflecting the process from the branch's evaluation of meritorious service to the masses' commendation, and timely carried out summary and comprehensive reporting, reflecting the gains and achievements of the movement, while the county joint office also made a comprehensive report on the entire county, which can not only reflect the overall situation, but also provide specific experience. This method needs to be promoted more. Third, pay attention to reporting the process. The strength of guidance of a news report and communication has a great relationship with the clarity and specificity of the facts and problems reported. For example, under what circumstances did a problem arise? How did it develop? Under what work foundation and mass conditions was an experience created? All need to be specifically introduced in order to play the role of exchanging experience. The news "Xiangyuan Chengguan Factory Squeezes Feudalism" (see page 2 of this newspaper on July 11) reports the process of discovering and solving a problem in short words, which is of great guiding significance. Comrade Wang Julin's "Discussion on the Three Great Combinations" in Pingshun reported on how Pingshun, on the basis of years of organization, provided various different organizational forms such as unified leadership and the method of changing work points into dividends, which is clear, specific, and easy to be accepted by other places. At present, some news communications lack specific and vivid content, only piling up some abstract and boring empty words; or only listing some phenomena, without raising any problems, all should be avoided and overcome as much as possible.
　　On the eve of the "September 1st" anniversary, I hope everyone will take action, carry out a mutual assistance and self-study movement, strengthen news business learning, and strive to improve the quality of news reporting.

### 大家动手提高一步

　　大家动手提高一步
    本报六、七两月新闻文艺奖金已评选结束：其中共包括工作研究、工作经验、新闻通讯，以及战争与生产、土地改革运动场面及英雄人物的报告速写等十三篇。这些新闻通讯和文艺创作的共同特点，作到了“能解决一个问题或解释清楚一个问题”，能够通过一件事实，一个人物的报导和描绘，给予读者以明晰印象，有较强的指导性与启发性，值得研究提倡。
    新闻报导方面：太行行署杨尚枫同志，在参加生产检查队工作中，经过充分调查研究，提出“如何把查田运动的积极分子变为生产运动中的积极分子”，解决了由土地改革转向大生产运动一个重要课题。而柳村同志从反映典型着手，介绍了翻身英雄梁马斗由查田积极分子当选生产功臣的过程，给全区翻身农民在生产中继续立功提供出了活的榜样。涉县一区分委邢崇智同志，用自己工作中切身体验的事实，报导了基点干部如何运用深入创造典型推动全面的领导方法，解决了县区干部领导方法上长期不易解决的问题。像这种“作啥写啥”，把自己工作中的经验总结提升的方法，以及在内容上的充实与文字上的朴素都是值得提倡和学习的。
    文艺创作方面：古维进同志的“扭转了俺爹的脑筋”，深刻的刻划出一个翻身农民积极分子，如何坚强不屈的去与父亲进行阶级斗争。吴林泉同志的“王殿文回家”很好的写出了翻身斗争和自卫战争中一对新农民夫妇关系的觉悟及其向上精神。曾克同志的“一个老英雄的决心”，生动的写出了人民踊跃参加爱国自卫战争的积极性。以上作品都给了群众以很好的榜样。而胡征同志的“强渡黄河”，又是及时的告诉了人人关心的一件大事情，给了读者以极大鼓舞。此外这些作品还很好的运用了速写报告等形式，迅速反映了眼前的现实。我们感到眼前现实发展的很快，抓紧运用报告、速写或故事等形式较迅速的反映这种变化中的现实，是值得提倡的。我们希望今后能收到更多反映战争、生产与土地改革中丰富现实的短小精练的创作。
    在这次评选中，值得提出的是新闻所占比例不够大，比较能报导出一个问题的发展过程，具有较强指导性的好新闻还不多，尤其缺乏反映生产运动的精彩新闻。这说明了我们在新闻写作上还须进一步努力。怎样写新闻？怎样写好新闻？需要我们加强学习，认真在新闻报导上提高一步！在这里我们愿提出几点意见与大家共勉：第一、发扬调查研究作风，深入实际，实事求是的分析问题，我们要想不作“空洞无物的宣传”，就“需要掌握材料，深思熟虑做分析”，“研究所写的东西，对人民有益处”，认真提出问题和解决问题。要避免平均的使用力量，什么也说，什么也说不清楚。杨尚枫等同志的精神值得进一步的提倡。第二、要善于选择典型作连续报导。涉县在“七一”前后布置了生产立功运动，从县办公室以至到区都注意了这一运动的连续报导，一、四、五、八、九各区都做得很好。一区分书邢崇智同志，依托神头基点为典型连续报导了支部立功表模运动，反映出支部评功到群众表功的过程，并及时进行了总结性的综合报导，反映出运动的收获与成绩，而县联合办公室也作了全县的综合报导，既能反映面貌，也提供了具体经验，这种方法需多发扬。第三、要注意报导过程，一篇新闻和通讯指导性的强弱，对于所报导的事实与问题交代的清楚和具体明确有很大关系，比如一个问题在什么情形下产生的？如何发展的？一个经验在什么工作基础、群众条件下创造出来的？都需要具体的介绍出来，才能起交流经验的作用。“襄垣城关工厂挤封建”（见七月十一日本报二版）新闻，用简短的文字报导发现和解决一个问题的过程，指导意义很大。王巨林同志所写平顺“关于三大结合的商榷”，报导平顺在几年来组织起来的基础上，提供了各种不同的组织形式如何统一领导与变工分红方法等，明确具体，也易为别地所接受。目前有些新闻通讯，无具体生动内容，只堆砌若干抽象枯燥空调；或只罗列一些现象，提不出问题，都应尽量避免与克服。
    值此“九一”纪念前夕，希望大家动手，开展互助自学运动，加强新闻业务学习，为提高新闻报导质量而努力。
