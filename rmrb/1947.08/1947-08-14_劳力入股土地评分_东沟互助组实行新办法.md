　　Labor Shares in Land, Land Scoring
　　Donggou Mutual Aid Group Implements New Methods
    [Our Correspondent Group, 12th dispatch] Reporters, along with leading organs in Shahe and some rural comrades, after research, discovered a new method of mutual aid in Donggou Village, Shahe County: labor shares in land, land scoring. Donggou is an old liberated area. Mutual aid hoeing began in 1943. At that time, disputes arose over who hoed first and who hoed last, as well as wage disputes, and mutual aid collapsed. This was because land hoed first had a better harvest and saved labor, so everyone wanted to hoe their own land first. Also, at that time, middle peasants dominated the mutual aid group. They needed labor and set wages low. Poor peasants had little land and a lot of labor and wanted to set wages higher. If wages were low, it was better to go out and do odd jobs. These problems could not be solved, forming a situation that was neither voluntary nor equal in value, inevitably leading to collapse. In 1944, it was reorganized. The leadership mobilized everyone to recall that although mutual aid had shortcomings last year, it still saved more than a thousand labor days. Detailed methods of calculating work and converting work points were determined, and wages were increased, and mutual aid was re-established. After 1945 and 1946, mutual aid neither collapsed nor improved, but the hoeing dispute was never scientifically resolved. This year, the branch studied how to improve mutual aid and specifically planned how much labor each person's entire land and seeds would require, how much labor they could contribute themselves, and how much labor could be saved, thus discovering this method of labor shares in land and land scoring. After democratic appraisal, based on the distance, quality, and other conditions of each person's land, the amount of labor required was determined, and the landowner contributed the same number of work tickets, which were kept by the group leader as each person's expenditure. Then, through democratic appraisal, based on the labor intensity and technical level of each person and livestock, it was determined how much work one day would be worth. It was also explained that if the labor was good, points could be added. For each day of labor, the group leader would pay the corresponding work tickets. Finally, depending on the number of work tickets in hand, the surplus would be paid and the deficit would be made up. This was each person's income. Military dependents' land was similarly scored, and the entire group contributed work tickets. Finally, it was based on the land and labor burden of each person. This method had a great effect. During the hoeing period alone, 286 labor days were saved, which was one-fifth less than the initially assessed labor required for the land. The initially assessed labor required was based on the labor efficiency of last year's mutual aid, and last year's mutual aid saved one-third of the labor compared to individual labor. According to this method, the efficiency was actually increased by one-half compared to individual labor. This year, agricultural affairs were very busy. The village also extracted male laborers to open up more than 60 mu of wasteland, which was all planted with buckwheat, and transferred all female laborers to concentrate on weaving. Yuan Jingzi, Liu Dengquan, and other six people, who were not very enthusiastic in the past, were re-evaluated and had their scores increased due to their active efforts. This method: first, can maximize the production enthusiasm of the group members. Since the work tickets required for their own land have already been spent, if their own labor is not enough for that number, they will have to pay money at the end. Seeing that they can exceed it completely, they will extract labor to open up wasteland and engage in sideline occupations; sideline occupations are also divided into work tickets, and a certain amount of subsidies are obtained. The money earned is distributed according to the total labor and land scores of the group. Second, how much labor is used each day and how much land is planted is very clear, and the benefits of mutual aid can be clearly identified at any time, making it easy to consolidate. Third, the hoeing dispute that has not been resolved for many years has also been easily resolved, because everyone has already contributed work tickets, and if more labor is used on his plot of land, it is jointly contributed by the entire group, and the savings are also shared by the entire group. Fourth, accounting is easy. Work tickets are paid immediately after each day's labor is completed, saving the trouble of using the work conversion method in the past, where accounting would be argued for half the night each time.

　　劳力入股土地评分
  　东沟互助组实行新办法
    【本报记者团十二日电】记者和沙河领导机关及若干乡村同志研究结果，发现了该县东沟村劳力入股、土地评分的互助新办法。东沟是老区，四三年即开始互助锄苗，当时发生先锄后锄及工资纠纷，互助垮了，因先锄的地收获较好，又省工，谁都愿先锄自己的，又因当时互助组中，中农占优势，他们需要劳力，把工资订得低，贫农地少劳力多，想把工资订高些，低了还不如外出打短工，这些个问题不能解决，形成既不自愿，又不等价，势必垮台。四四年重新组织，领导上发动大家回忆去年互助虽有缺点，仍省工千余，确定了详细计工折工办法，提高了工资，又把互助搞起。经过四五、四六两年，互助未垮也未提高，但锄苗纠纷始终未能科学解决。今年支部研究如何提高互助，具体计划每个人全部土地种籽，要用多少工，自己尽量劳动，能出多少工，能省多少工，于是发现了这个劳力入股、土地评分方法。经过民主评议，按照每个人土地的远近好坏等条件，确定需多少工，由地主人出同数的工票，交组长保存，作为每个人的支出，再经民主评议，按照每个人及牲口的劳动强度，技术高低，确定作一天顶多少工。并说明劳动得好，可以加分，每劳动一天，组长即付给应得工票，最后视手中工票数，长入短出，这是每个人的收入。军属地同样评分，由全组出工票，最后按照每个人的土地劳力担负。这个方法，发挥极大效果，仅锄苗期间，即省工二百八十六个，较最初所评土地需工数少用了五分之一。最初所评需工数，系以去年互助劳动的效率为基准，而去年互助较个体劳动省工三分之一，按此方法，实较个体劳动提高效率二分之一。今年农事甚忙，该村尚抽出男劳力开了六十多亩生荒，已全部种上荞麦，调剂出所有女劳力，全力纺织，过去劳动不很起劲的原井子、刘登全等六人，都因积极努力，被大家重评，提高了分数，这种方法：第一、可提高组员最大的生产积极性，自己土地所需工票，既已支出，自己劳动不够那个数目，最后要付钱，超过了可付钱，看着可以全超过，就抽出劳力开荒、搞副业；搞副业同样分工票，并取得一定数量津贴，赚了钱按全组劳力、土地分数分红。第二、每天用了多少工，种了多少地，看得很清楚，能随时明确互助的好处，容易巩固。第三、多年未解决的锄苗纠纷，也迎刃而解，因每个人都已出工票，他那块地用工多是全组伙出，省下也是全组共得。第四、算帐容易，每天劳动完毕，立时付给工票，省去了过去用折工计工方法，每次算帐吵半夜的麻烦。
