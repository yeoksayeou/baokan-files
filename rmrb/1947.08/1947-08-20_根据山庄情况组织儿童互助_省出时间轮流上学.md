　　Organizing Children's Mutual Aid Based on Mountain Village Conditions to Save Time for Rotational Schooling
    [Our Newspaper, Shexian News] Xiaofeng Village in the Seventh District is a mountain village composed of a dozen small natural villages. The households are very scattered. The whole village has one hundred and six households and seventy-eight school-age children. There is no educational foundation, especially the integration of production and learning is not good. During the summer farming season, there are almost no students in the school. This year, Comrade Huang Yaotang was transferred to Xiaofeng as a teacher. He first went there to understand the situation, first visited the children's parents. The parents were also willing to send their children to school, but because of the summer farming season, no one grazed the livestock, and some families lacked labor, so no one carried water. After understanding the overall situation, he immediately convened a meeting of children's parents to discuss specific ways to help the children's parents solve their difficulties. At this parents' meeting, two methods were discussed: one was to organize livestock groups by area (small natural villages), one was organized by a large natural village, and three were organized by a small natural village, calling on the children to take turns grazing livestock, with two children grazing a group each day, so that the remaining children could be freed up to go to school; the other method was that for families lacking labor, larger children were organized to carry water in mutual aid every morning, with three children in a group or four children in a group. Xiaofeng's water source is relatively far away, more than half a li away. In the past, before being organized, some children could not spare time to go to school just by carrying water. After mutual aid, they helped each other carry water early in the morning, and they could go to school in the morning and afternoon. Their method of converting work was to treat four loads of water as one work point. Whoever was short on work points would make up for it on Sunday. In this way, not only could children from families lacking labor go to school, but also the children would not be afraid of wolves when they went to carry water, and the parents were also relieved. After the teacher's subjective efforts to specifically solve the difficulties for the children's parents, in three days, the number of students in Xiaofeng increased from twenty to fifty-eight, filling both classrooms. Xiaofeng has never had so many students. (Youhe, Shucheng, Wuyun, Qimei, Jianzhang)
    [Also News] After the schools opened this summer, the students were unwilling to buy books and stationery because the parents felt that this year's weather was arid and had become a year of drought. Buying things was a minor matter, but not having rice to eat was a major matter, so when the students went home to ask for money to buy books, the parents were unwilling to let them buy. Thus, students buying books and stationery became a major difficulty. Teachers Wu Yun of Hezhang, Qimei of Taizhuang, and Jin Wangting of Hougou actively thought of ways to have the children engage in production to solve the difficulty of buying books, personally leading the children to climb trees to collect locust flowers. The three schools of Hezhang, Hougou, and Taizhuang collected a total of one hundred and twenty-one jin of locust flowers, which could be exchanged for three jin of millet per jin, totaling three hundred and sixty-three jin of millet, which could be sold for more than 58,000 yuan. In this way, the students not only did not have to ask their families for money to buy books, but also helped their families with the remaining money. (Wu Yun, Youhe, Shucheng, Qimei, Jianzhang)
    [Our Newspaper, Southern Hebei, 17th Dispatch] Lu Shengchun, a teacher at Zhang Sanzhai Elementary School in the Eighth District of Linqing, runs the farming school well and has been selected as an educational hero. This spring, because most students needed to help with production at home, and some were about to drop out of school due to lack of books and stationery, he personally took action to lead the students in production to solve their difficulties and achieved significant results. He organized four salt-leaching groups, selling a total of more than 120,000 yuan. He also used the money from selling salt to buy a donkey, which was used to pull bows and fluff cotton for people, earning a profit of more than 10,000 yuan. Three weaving groups earned a profit of more than 50,000 yuan in two months, the oil-selling group earned a profit of 3,000 yuan, and the manure-collecting group sold 8,000 yuan. In addition, he also reclaimed two mu of wasteland, dug a well, planted half a mu of flowers, and planted gourds and beans, which not only provided vegetables for their own consumption but also solved the full year's expenses. The masses said, "The students can not only study but also earn money. They are even more diligent and thrifty than at home! This is truly a school for us farmers." Recently, at the county-wide education conference, Lu Shengchun was selected as the first educational hero.

　　根据山庄情况组织儿童互助
  　省出时间轮流上学
    【本报涉县讯】七区小峰村是个山沟村，由十几个小自然村合成的，住户非常散漫，全村一百零六户，学龄儿童七十八个，教育没有基础，尤其是生产与学习没有结合好，一到夏季农忙时，学校几乎就没有学生。今年夏季黄耀堂同志调到小峰当教员，他首先到那里，先了解情况，先访问儿童家长，家长也愿意叫儿童上学，就是因为夏季农忙，没人放牲口，还有缺乏劳力的家庭，没人担水。他理解了全面情况后，马上召集儿童家长商议，具体的帮助儿童家长解决困难。在这个家长会议上讨论出两个办法：一个是按片（小自然村）组织牲口群，大自然村组织一个，小自然村三个组织一个，叫儿童轮流放牲口，每天两个儿童放一群，这样能腾出其余儿童来上学；另一个办法是劳力缺乏的家庭，每天清早组织大些儿童互助担水，有三个儿童一组的，有四个儿童一组的，小峰吃水比较远，有半里多地，一清早只能担一趟，在以前未组织起来，有的儿童光担水，就不能腾出时间上学，经过互助起来，他们清早互助担水，上午下午能上学。他们折工的办法，担四担水顶一个工，谁短下工，星期日还工，这样不但缺乏劳力的儿童能上学，同时儿童去担水也不怕狼，家长也放心。经过教员的主观努力，给儿童家长具体解决困难之后，在三天当中，小峰学生由二十个增加到五十八个，两个教室满满的，小峰从来没有这样多的学生。（友鹤、树成、吴云、其美、建章）
    【又讯】今年夏季各学校开学后，学生到校都不愿意买书籍文具，原因是家长觉得今年天气亢旱，已成了灾荒年，买东西是小事，没米吃是大事，所以学生回家要钱买书，家长不愿意叫买，这样学生买书籍文具就成了大困难。合漳教员吴云，台庄教员其美，后沟教员晋王亭，就积极想办法，叫儿童生产，解决买书困难，亲自带领儿童上树弄槐花。合漳、后沟、台庄三个学校共弄槐花一百二十一斤，每斤换三斤小米，能换三百六十三斤小米，能卖洋五万八千余元，这样学生不但不用向家要钱买书，且把剩上的钱帮助了家庭。（吴云、友鹤、树成、其美、建章）
    【本报冀南十七日电】临清八区张三寨小学教师卢生春庄稼学校办得好，被选为教育功臣。今春因大多数学生需要帮助家中生产，有的因没书籍文具而将失学，他便亲自动手，领导学生生产解决困难，并获得显著成绩。共组织了四个淋盐组，共卖洋十二万余元。并用卖盐的钱买了驴，给人家拉弓弹花，共获利一万余元。三个纺织组，两月得利五万余元，卖油组获利三千余元，拾粪组卖洋八千元。另外还开荒二亩，掘土井一个，点了半亩花，种上东瓜豆角，除自己吃菜外，并能解决全年经费。群众说：“学生不但能念书，还能赚钱，比在家还勤俭哩！这真是咱庄稼人的学校。”最近在全县教育大会上，卢生春被选为第一个教育功臣。
