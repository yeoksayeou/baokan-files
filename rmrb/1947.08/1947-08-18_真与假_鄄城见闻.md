　　Truth and Falsehood
    ——Observations in Juancheng
    Lian Yunshan
    In the company headquarters of the Fourth Squad, the following incident occurred: In the middle of the night, the troops billeted, knocking on the door of a local villager. The old woman who opened the door took several steps back in fright, retreating into the house where suddenly a cry was heard, alarming neighbors who came to inquire. It turned out that a gray-haired old woman had been frightened to death. A group of villagers were pinching her and twisting her hair. Another villager was also trembling uncontrollably. Wen Gan and Li Shouliang explained, "The Eighth Route Army is here, don't be afraid, everyone..." In the darkness, they couldn't be recognized, and the old woman remained terrified. At dawn, the villagers recognized that we were the Eighth Route Army. The frightened-to-death woman woke up, and the trembling one stopped trembling.
    Later, we finally understood what had happened. The old woman who came back to life said:
    "The year before last, the Central Army came, hitting and cursing, shouting and yelling, scaring me into an illness. Whenever I saw the Central Army, I couldn't catch my breath. Last night, I thought it was the Central Army again and couldn't catch my breath. Good, today it's good, it's our Eighth Route Army that saves people's lives. I'm not afraid."
    "And you?" someone asked the trembling old woman;
    "I don't have any illness, I thought the Central Army was coming, so I pretended to be sick, not letting them stay in the house."

    四小队连部，发生了这样一件事情，半夜部队宿营，敲开一家老乡的门子，开门的老太太吓的倒退数步，钻到屋里忽然哭声传出，惊动街坊邻居，前来探望，原来一个白发斑斑的老太太给吓死了，一群老乡给她撇指头扭头发，另一个老乡也是哆嗦打的不停止，文干李守良给解释：“八路军来了，不要怕，一家人…………”黑夜里，认不清，老太太依然是怕的不行，天明了，老乡认出我们是八路军来了。吓死的醒过来了，哆嗦的不哆嗦了。
    以后，我们才问明白了，那个死而复活的老太太说：
    “头年里中央军来了，又打又骂，前后吆喝，把我吓成一种病，一见中央军就出不上气来，作晚俺当成又是中央军又出不上气来了，好了，今天好了，是咱救人救命的八路军。俺不怕。”
    “你啦”有人问那个打哆嗦的老太太；
    “俺没啥病，当成是中央军来了，俺唏唏哼哼装病，不叫他住房子”。
