Snowflower Mountain
Memories of Red Army Life
Narrated by Luo Liangyi
Recorded by Geng Xi

Comrade, I can't really tell you what that place is called. It's a place where travelers never go, and you can't find it on any map. There are still a few families at the foot of the mountain. I asked an old lady, and she said, "No one has ever come here, and we haven't given it a name. Don't you see the snow all over the mountain? Just call it 'Snowflower Mountain'." So, I can only tell you that.

Around July 1935, during the Long March, we broke through the Maogong River to Songpan. That was already the tail end of the so-called "Seventy-Two Passes". The higher-ups gave us a mission to defend Snowflower Mountain and cover the entire army's retreat to Maoergai. It was a single road to Maoergai, and if the position was lost, the entire army would have to detour four hundred miles and take another month to reach its destination. Soon the First and Fourth Front Armies would join forces, and the Party Central Committee would hold a meeting in Maoergai, making the mission even more critical.

How high is that mountain? I can't tell you how many meters or how much altitude, but I can tell you that it's five miles from Zijingguan at the bottom of the river to the old lady's place. There, you can still see a few terraced fields. Once you pass that point, it's desolate, with only a forest. Climbing another fifteen miles up, we encamped in a stone forest. Climbing twenty-five miles further up from there, nothing grows, just stone.

The mountain is steep, and I can't give you any measurements. I only remember one day, a young orderly was tearing grass on the hillside to clean a white porcelain cup. He lost his grip, and the cup fell down. It kept rolling down the slope. The kid called us out to watch. The cup, so big, rolled until it looked like an egg, and kept rolling until we couldn't see it anymore. It was probably still rolling down. There wasn't even a flat spot to sit down. So, every afternoon, we competed by rolling stones, both for fun and to repair the road.

Our headquarters was originally just a rock overhang, only enough space for one or two people to crouch. After digging it out a bit, it could only fit three people lying down. The division commander, chief of staff, and I squeezed in there, plus a telephone – we couldn't do without that. At night, the three of us slept head to head and foot to foot. No one dared to turn over too much, because even a slight misstep could lead to the same danger as that cup...

Needless to say, the terrain was terrible, and the climate was even worse. We went up the mountain in July, the hottest time of the year, but we couldn't survive without a fire in the early morning and evening. Some sentries even froze to death because they couldn't light a fire in the thin air. At midday, it was too hot to wear a single layer. Our mountain was too high for airplanes to fly over. The Kuomintang planes came every day, but they only dared to circle over the riverbed below the mountain.

The wind here was frightening. It often blew away the tents we had set up for our bivouac, and hail the size of eggs could fly through the air. From mid-morning to mid-afternoon, a black cloud could suddenly appear in the clear sky, followed by a gust of wind and hailstones mixed with snow. Instantly, the mountain would be covered with a layer of snow, and even while it was snowing, we could still see the sun shining brightly three to five miles away.

What about food? At first, we had some dry rations to eat with beef. But after a few days, the dry rations were gone, and we only ate roasted beef. You might think beef would be delicious, but we didn't have a drop of oil or a grain of salt. The beef came from the cattle farms, and the meat was very fatty. It was okay for the first couple of meals, but after that, no one wanted to eat it anymore. Our noses were burning, our eyes were watering, and our gums were aching.

Office supplies? Of course, there was no way to talk about them, but we had new inventions. We had a few sheets of paper, but we had to keep them for writing reports to our superiors. We could only use birch bark to write orders to the troops below. Later, we thought it was too far to peel birch bark, so we switched to using dried acorn leaves. Unfortunately, one time, a messenger carrying an order written on oak leaves fell and broke the "order." So, we came up with another idea: we collected the leaves, pressed them with stones to dry them in the shade, and then exposed them to the sun until they turned yellow. Then, they wouldn't be brittle and wouldn't break if they fell. But that was too much trouble. People thought about it and simply boiled the cow shed rafters in water to remove the fat and then wrote on them with pencils. At the time, we thought that was the best way.

Our clothes were torn to shreds after a few days in the woods. After eating mutton, we dried the leftover sheepskins and wore them as capes tied with cowhide ropes. At night, we relied on squeezing together to keep warm. The more people squeezed together, the warmer it was.

However, these were still good days. After a few more days, Hu Zongnan sent a battalion to build fortifications on Motianling, fifty miles away from us, and drove all the nearby cattle farms there to guard them, trying to starve us out.

So, we burned cowhide to eat, but there wasn't much cowhide left, and it was hard to keep going. So, we started to imitate Shennong and taste hundreds of herbs. Many people in our troops were from Sichuan, and they were from the area and dug medicinal herbs. They led everyone up the mountain to dig. Although some people accidentally ate poisonous plants and died, we finally discovered more than forty kinds of edible plants, including: caragana, rhubarb leaves, water celery, wild carrots, etc. Caragana, however, caused constipation if eaten too much, and rhubarb leaves easily caused diarrhea. Some wild leaves didn't even have names. We just looked at them and made up names for them.

As a result, the number of sick people increased, and the mortality rate increased. How could we keep going? What ideas supported us? The story of the Red Fourth Front Army, which started with three and a half rifles, supported us. The Party Central Committee encouraged us. The higher-ups wanted us to hold off the enemy and protect the Party's meeting. Who wouldn't think that was glorious? Who didn't respect their revolutionary history? Everyone was thinking that even if we sacrificed ourselves, the Party wouldn't forget us. Who wouldn't fight to the death?

Whether we could eliminate the enemy on Motianling was a matter of life and death.

The division commander told the deputy division commander, Wang Youjun, the intentions of the higher-ups and his own determination. Wang Youjun lived in a small village behind Zijingguan. One day, while it was raining heavily, he called.

"We're going to complete that mission you mentioned today."

"Isn't that impossible, with such heavy rain..." the division commander asked.

"That's what I've been waiting for."

"Hmm..." The division commander only hummed. I was listening from the side, and it seemed to me that the deputy division commander was smiling on the phone, and the division commander was smiling too.

"Then, we'll set off right away."

"Good!"

The telephone was hung up. I immediately went to the deputy division commander to set off with the troops. The enemy had a battalion, and we only went with a battalion. It was so dark that you couldn't see your hand in front of your face. Everyone untied their leggings and tied them together to make a rope, and felt their way along.

To prevent our attack, the enemy had cut down all the stone bamboo on the mountain, leaving only four or five inches. It was impossible to walk, let alone charge. The enemy was also in a high position on the front, and there were deer traps outside the fortifications. It was impossible to gain a foothold and impossible to attack. So, we decided to send a company to feign an attack in the front, move the main force to the enemy's rear, and strike from above. We put a platoon on the left flank to attack from the side, and the rest were left as reserves.

Sure enough, as soon as the gun went off in the front, the main attacking force had reached the top of the mountain behind the enemy's last position. They charged down, and the enemy fled. Because the frontal attack was too early, two companies of the enemy slipped away from the flank. We rushed in, and the troops were all stuck together. We didn't even bother to pull the pins on the grenades, and we beat them on the enemy's heads. In the end, we only captured the weapons of one company and got nine Browning automatic rifles. At that time, that was better than today's American-equipped troops. Everyone was extremely happy, but unfortunately, our deputy division commander, Comrade Wang Youjun, died in the battle.

Before and after this, the enemy attacked us three times. The first time, the enemy was probing and only attacked the troops at the foot of the mountain before retreating. They didn't realize there were more troops behind us. The second time, the enemy came with a division, just when we were out solving the problem of that battalion. There were only some old and weak soldiers left at home. We only had a regiment there, and after a battalion left, there was little left. The situation was very dangerous. The enemy was fierce and aggressive and even reached the entrance of our headquarters. But we sent a platoon to drill behind the enemy and fight. We blocked their retreat with stones, and the enemy panicked. We didn't dare to use too many bullets and rolled stones to drive the enemy back. The third time, the enemy came and didn't gain any advantage. Instead, a part of them was wiped out. At that time, the main force had already passed, the Maoergai meeting had ended, and the higher-ups were about to take us back.

The battle of Motianling undoubtedly terrified the enemy. Every Kuomintang prisoner we captured told us, "The daytime is okay, but at night, our hearts pound." We held on the mountain for forty-eight days before withdrawing. The mission was glorious, and those forty-eight days were difficult. I will remember them for the rest of my life....

    雪花山上
    红军生活回忆散记
    罗良仪述
    耿西记
    同志，我也不能确实告诉你，那地方究竟叫什么名字，那里是行人绝迹，任何地图上，都找不出来的。山根脚还有几家人家，我问了问一个老太太，她说：“我们这里，从没有人来过，也没叫个啥名字，你不看满山大雪，就叫它个‘雪花山’吧”。因此我便只能这样告诉你了。
    一九三五年七月间，我们长征，突过了懋功到松藩的大河，那已经是所谓“七十二”道关的尾巴了。上级给了我们一个任务，要坚守雪花山，掩护全军拖到毛儿盖去。那里是通毛儿盖的一条独路，倘若阵地一失，则全军必需再多弯四百里路，多走一个月，也不一定能赶到目的地去。不久一、四方面军就要会合，党中央在毛儿盖开会，这任务就更严重了。
    那座山有多高呢？我既不能说出多少公尺，也不能说出多少海拔来，然而，我可以告诉你，从河底紫荆关到老太太那里是五里地，那里，还可以见到几垄坡地，一过此处，便渺无人烟，仅有一片森林，再往上爬十五里地，便是我们按在石头树林里的司令部。从那里再往上爬，还有二十五里，那里便寸草不生，尽是石头的天下了。
    山是壁陡的，陡到什么程度，我也不能拿测量数字告诉你。只记得一天，小勤务员在山坡上扯草擦洋磁缸子，一失手，把缸子跌了下去，缸子一直顺着山坡滚，小鬼喊我们出去看，那么大的缸子，滚得只看到鸡蛋那样大了，还在往下滚，一直滚到眼睛都看不见了，大约还在滚下去。出门几乎连一屁股平的地方都没有，因此每天下午，我们便比赛滚石头，一边娱乐，一边也修了路。
    我们司令部住的地方，原来只是个石崖，只能弯着身子，躲下一两个人，挖大了一点，也只能躺下三个人，师长、参谋长和我挤在那里，外加一架电话机，那是再也减少不得的了。晚上，我们三个人，头挨头，脚挨脚的睡着，谁也不敢大翻个身，因为稍为不慎，便会有那个缸子同样的危险……。
    地形的恶劣是不用说了，气候呢？那就更坏。我们上山，还是阳历七月间，天气最热的时候，而一早一晚不烧火烤，便支持不住，晚上放哨，有些地方空气稀薄，竟因为点不着火而冻死人。而正晌午时，却又热得穿不住单衣。我们那座山上，是飞机都飞不上去的，国民党的飞机每天来，而他们却只敢在山下，河滩的上空盘旋。
    这里的风，刮起来也是怕人的，我们露宿搭的棚子，常常叫刮跑了，鸡蛋大的石头可以刮的满天飞。而从前半晌到后半晌的时间以内，晴得干干净净的天空里，突然可以飞起一朵乌云，马上一阵狂风吹来，石子般大的冰雹夹着雪，便飞打下来，立刻满山上，便铺了一层雪被窝，而就在那大雪纷飞的时候，我们还可以看到三五里内仍旧是大太阳。
    吃的东西哩，起先我们还有些干粮，可以配着牛肉吃。可是过了几天，干粮完了，净吃烤牛肉。你也许以为牛肉该是很好吃的吧，而我们那时候是没有一滴油，没有一粒盐的，牛肉是从牛场里打来的，肉也很肥，吃头一两顿还可以，再往下，人可都不愿意吃了，鼻子里发烧，眼睛冒火，牙齿根子都烧痛了。
    用的办公文具呢？那当然更谈不到了，但我们却有新创造，我们本来还有几张纸，但那是要留着准备给上级写报告用的；我们往下面写命令，只能用桦树皮，后来又嫌剥桦树皮太远，便改用干橡子树叶子了。不幸有一次通讯员拿着橡树叶子写的命令下山，跌了一跤，把“命令”也跌碎了。于是我们又想出了办法，将采回的叶子，用石头压着阴干，等变成了黄颜色的，再用太阳一晒，那便不是焦脆的，跌不碎了。但这也太费事，人们又想了想法，干脆把牛掀棚骨用水一煮，去掉脂肪，便用铅笔在上面写起来，用完了，擦了再写。当时我们觉得这比什么都好。
    衣服哩，在林子里钻几天早就挂烂了。吃了羊肉，剩下羊皮，大家便把它晒干了，用牛皮绳子，穿着披起来，晚上睡觉，那就全靠挤了，人越挤的多，越暖和一些。
    然而，这还是好日子，再过了几天，胡宗南派了一个营，在离我们对面，相距五十里的摩天岭，挖了工事，把附近所有的牛场都赶到那里，看守起来，想饿死我们，叫我们不攻自破。
    于是，我们便烧牛皮吃，但牛皮也所剩无几了，很难维持下去，于是，我们学起神农氏尝百草来了。我们部队里有许多四川人，是当地挖药材出身的，他们领着大家上山挖，虽然也误食了毒草，毒死了一些人，而我们终于发现了四十多种草可吃，除我们常见几种外，尚有：车心草，大黄叶，水芹菜、野红萝卜等。而车心草是吃多了屙不下来，大黄叶子又容易泻肚，有些野叶，根本就没有名字，我们只不过看着象什么，便随口瞎叫罢了。
    这样，病号加多了，死亡率增大了，这还能坚持下去吗？什么思想支持着我们呢？红四方面军，三条半枪起家的故事，支持着我们，党中央鼓励着我们，上级要我们顶着敌人，保卫党的会议，谁听了这，不认为我们是光荣的呢？谁不尊重自己的革命历史呢？大家都在想着，即使牺牲了党也不会忘记我们的，谁还不拚命干呢？
    目前能否消灭摩天岭的敌人，便是我们生死存亡的问题了。
    师长把上级的意图和自己的决心，告诉了副师长王有钧，王有钧住在紫荆关后面的小村里，一天正下着暴雨的时候，他打电话来了。
    “你说的那个任务，我们今天去完成。”
    “不行吧，这么大的雨……”长反问他。
    “我就是等的这一手。”
    “嗯”——师长只嗯了一声，我在旁边听着，似乎觉得副师长在电话里笑了，师长也笑了。
    “那，我们马上就出发了。”
    “好！”
    电话机挂上了，我马上到副师长那里，跟队伍出发，敌人是一个营，我们也只去了一个营，天黑得伸手不见掌，大家把绑腿解下来，联成一条绳子，摸着它走。
    敌人为了防止我们的进攻，把满山的石竹子都削光了，留了四五寸长，路根本不能走，更不能跑步冲锋，敌人的正面又居高临下，工事外面还加了鹿寨，根本站不住脚，无法攻。于是我们决定派一个连正面佯攻，把主力运动到敌人后面，从头上盖下来，左翼放了一个排侧击，其余的，都留作预备队。
    果然正面枪一响，主攻部队已到了敌人最后阵地的山顶上，一冲下来，敌人便逃窜开了。还是因为正面打的过早一些，敌人有两个连乘空从侧翼溜跑了，我们一冲拢去，队伍都粘住了，手榴弹也顾不得拉火，便在敌人的头上打起来了，最后，我们只缴了一个连的械，得了九挺白朗宁的自动步枪。那在当时，却也顶了今天的美械化的部队了。大家都高兴的了不得，只是不幸得很，我们的副师长王有钧同志竟在战斗中牺牲了。
    在此前后，敌人曾先后进攻了我们三次，头一次敌人是试探性的，只攻到我们山根脚的部队跟前，便退回去了，根本未发觉我们后面还有部队。第二次敌人来了一个师，正是我们出发解决那个营的时候，家里只剩了些老弱兵，我们在那里只有一个团，走了一个营，所剩无几了。形势很险危，敌人气势凶凶，曾打到司令部门口来，但我们派了一个排钻到敌后打起来，用石头把他们的后路一堵，敌人便慌了，我们不敢多用子弹，滚石头把敌人打退了，第三次敌人来了没有讨到任何便宜，反而被歼灭了一部分，当时大军已过，毛儿盖会议已经结束，上级正要收我们了。
    而摩天岭一仗，无疑是使敌人丧胆了，以后抓到的每一个国民党的俘虏都告诉我们：“白天里还好过，晚上心里便蹦蹦跳了。”我们一直在山上坚守了四十八天，才撤下来，任务是光荣的，而那四十八天是难过的，我一辈子也会记得……。
