　　Central Bureau Propaganda Department
  　Holds Communications and Reporting Conference
    Calls for Using Party Newspapers, Radio Stations, etc. to Guide Work
    [Special Dispatch from Our Newspaper] On August 16th, Comrade Panshi of the Central Bureau Propaganda Department personally presided over a communications and reporting conference. Attendees included Deputy Chief of Staff Wang from the Military Region Headquarters, Minister Ren from the Political Department's Propaganda Department, Section Chief Liang from the General Staff Office, Comrade Zhang Defu from the Border Region Government's Education Department, and Comrades Chang Zhenyu and Xiao Feng from Handan Radio Station, totaling over ten people. The central focus of the meeting was to study how to utilize Party newspapers, radio stations, general and branch news agencies, and other institutions to guide work, strengthen internal and external education and propaganda, and overcome the handicraft-style working methods of each doing their own thing, being accustomed only to running small newspapers and using mimeographed circulars to guide work, not accustomed to using Party newspapers, radio stations, general and branch news agencies, and other institutions to guide work, with the result that work instructions, when conveyed, often lost their timeliness and were difficult to universally implement. Comrade Xiao Feng said: Handan Radio Station mainly broadcasts news from our region, and requests that comrades from various organs, troops, and local work units actively provide materials to the radio station. Minister Ren said: In addition to reporting our army's victories, newspapers, radio stations, and general and branch news agencies should report more on rear area work, such as supporting the army and honoring meritorious deeds, which has a great motivating effect on frontline soldiers. Section Chief Liang said: Leading comrades should pay special attention to Party newspapers, radio stations, general and branch news agencies, and learn to use these tools to guide work. Except for classified matters, try to get general information published in the newspapers and broadcast on the radio. He said that instructions issued by the Military Region using mimeograph (or writing) often failed to reach many places due to the vast territory and inconvenient transportation, or were not read even if they were conveyed, but instructions published in the newspapers were seen by everyone. Finally, they exchanged work situations with each other and agreed to communicate more in their work in the future to jointly improve reporting work.
    [Another Dispatch] The Jin-Ji-Lu-Yu Military Region Headquarters, based on the spirit of the Central Bureau Propaganda Department's conference on strengthening communications and reporting work, convened a reporting conference on the 19th to review past reporting work. The meeting clarified several ideological issues: First, newspapers and radio stations are not only weapons for guiding work in the local areas, but also weapons for guiding work in the army; they are weapons for external propaganda and also weapons for internal education, and should be fully valued and utilized. Whoever's work is published in the newspaper or broadcast on the radio will immediately promote the work. For example, when a news item about the replenishment regiment was published in the newspaper, the soldiers scrambled to read it, happily telling each other that they were in the newspaper and must do a good job! The next day, they got up before dawn to practice training. Publishing something in the newspaper once is more effective than several weeks of education. Second, writing articles is not only the responsibility of reporters, but also the responsibility of everyone. We should not only read the newspaper, but also write articles. Good reporting of one's own work mainly depends on oneself. Third, we must regard writing articles as one of the work tasks and one of the conditions for meritorious service. Rear area organs should actively look for materials, and then there will be gold everywhere. For example, military industry construction, medical work, troop training, prisoner of war work, etc., grasping their model figures and new work experiences, and elevating and synthesizing them, are all good news and good articles. In terms of reporting organization, three communication teams were organized based on the administrative organization unit (section), which regularly supplies manuscripts or materials to newspapers and radio stations.

　　中央局宣传部
  　召开通讯报导会议
    号召运用党报、广播电台等指导工作
    【本报特讯】八月十六日，中央局宣传部磐石同志，亲自主持召开通讯报导会议。出席者有军区司令部王副参谋长，政治部宣传部任部长，参谋处梁处长，边府教育厅张德甫同志，邯郸广播电台常振玉萧凤同志等十余人。会议中心研究如何利用党报、广播电台、总分社等机构指导工作，加强对内对外之教育宣传，克服各干各的手工业式的工作方法，只惯于自己办小报用油印通报指导工作，不惯于用党报、广播电台、总分社等机构指导工作，往往工作指示传达下去，既失去时效，又难普遍贯彻。萧风同志说：如邯郸广播电台主要是广播我区消息，要求各机关、部队、地方工作同志，主动给电台供给材料。任部长说：报纸、广播电台、总分社除应报导我军胜利消息外，要多报导一些后方工作，如优军、贺功等等活动，对前方战士鼓舞作用很大。梁处长说：领导同志要特别重视党报、广播电台、总分社，学会利用这些工具指导工作，除秘密性的东西外，一般东西尽可能争取在报上发表，在电台上广播。他说军区用油印（或写）发出的指示，因为地方辽阔，交通不便，好多没有传达下去，或传达下去没有看过，但在报上登的指示都看到了。最后互相交换工作情况，约定今后在工作上多打招呼，共同把报导工作做好。
    【又讯】晋冀鲁豫军区司令部，根据中央局宣传部加强通讯报导工作会议精神，于十九日召开报导会议，检讨过去报导工作。会上明确了几个思想问题：一、报纸、电台是地方上的指导工作武器，也是军队的指导工作武器；是对外的宣传武器，也是对内的教育武器，要充分重视利用。谁的工作在报上一登，电台上一广播，对工作马上就有推进作用。如补充团在报上登了一个消息，战士们争抢看报，欣相传告，说他们上了报啦，非好好干不可！第二天天不明即起练兵。登一次报，比几星期教育还强。二、写稿不仅是记者的责任！也是大家的责任，不仅看报，还要写稿，自己工作报导好，主要依靠自己。三、要把写稿当成工作任务之一，立功条件之一。后方机关要主动的找材料，就能遍地是黄金。如军工建设、医务工作，练兵、俘虏工作等等，抓紧其模范人物，新的工作经验，加以提升综合，都是好消息、好文章。报导组织，以行政组织单位处（科）为基础，组织了三个通讯小组，经常供给报馆、广播电台稿件或材料。　　　（毓明）
