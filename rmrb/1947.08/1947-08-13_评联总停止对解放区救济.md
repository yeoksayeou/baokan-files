Title: Commentary on UNRRA's Cessation of Relief to Liberated Areas

Xinhua News Agency Commentary:

　　Ignoring the repeated appeals from the Liberated Area Relief Association regarding the "fair and reasonable distribution of relief supplies," UNRRA has recently decided to cease relief to the Liberated Areas from July 28th, citing the Nationalist blockade as a pretext, while continuing to transport relief supplies to Nationalist-controlled areas. This measure was announced in Washington on the 30th, stating that the supply of relief materials would be suspended to all areas north of 34 degrees north latitude within China until the Nationalists "lift the anti-communist blockade" or "UNRRA rescinds its current decision."

　　The so-called "north of 34 degrees north latitude" refers to all Liberated Areas under the control of the People's Liberation Army, including most of the Northeast, North China, eastern Henan, and northern Jiangsu north of Suqian. Although this measure was decided by UNRRA's Far East Committee, the unfairness and unreasonableness of this decision are obvious. Since Chiang Kai-shek's government uses UNRRA's post-war relief supplies to wage a civil war, this will not differ based on a line of 34 degrees north latitude, therefore one cannot help but suspect for whom this UNRRA decision was made.

　　In early July, the Chiang government attempted to completely cut off relief supplies to the Liberated Areas by blockading ports and ordering all UNRRA personnel to withdraw from the Liberated Areas, so as to monopolize all relief supplies to be used as capital for the civil war. In order to oppose the government's conspiracy, the Liberated Areas proposed new suggestions to UNRRA for the rational distribution of relief supplies and assistance in direct transportation to ports in the Liberated Areas; pointing out that if this were not done, UNRRA would lose its meaning of existence in China, and therefore UNRRA should "completely withdraw from China" in order to maintain its political neutrality. However, UNRRA rejected this only reasonable and effective step and instead adopted the aforementioned measure of suspending relief to the Liberated Areas. No matter how UNRRA argues, this move has already shown that under a clever pretext, UNRRA is skillfully pushing the wheel of relief supplies onto the road of completely unilateral aid to Chiang's civil war.

　　According to an Associated Press report from Shanghai, Lin Zhong, the acting director of the Liberated Area Relief Association's Shanghai office, issued a statement on the 2nd of this month, stating that the Relief Association firmly protested UNRRA's action of aiding Chiang in the civil war, and demanded that UNRRA immediately stop all ships going to Nationalist ports and freeze all relief supplies in Nationalist warehouses pending a general solution to the problem. The Shanghai-based American newspaper, the "China Press," also expressed its dissatisfaction, publishing an article on the 1st condemning the Chiang government for violating the declaration of "distributing UNRRA materials to all without discrimination," and criticizing: "If China does not allow fair distribution of UNRRA materials, why should China continue to receive important heavy industrial materials that have not yet been distributed?" It pointed out that "UNRRA must take action to defend its neutral position."

　　Since UNRRA implemented relief in China, it has failed to be faithful to its purpose of "fair and reasonable distribution of relief supplies without regard to race, religion, or political belief," and placed the work of relief to China under the control of the Nationalist government's administration, making this work in fact become a blood transfusion for the Kuomintang's civil war. By the end of July this year, of the 2,151,376 tons of materials UNRRA transported to China, the Liberated Areas received only 1.53 percent, while the people in the Liberated Areas who suffered from the War of Resistance Against Japan totaled 26 million, accounting for more than half of the 42 million refugees nationwide; the huge amount of relief materials obtained by the Chiang government were mostly used for civil war. This is the true picture of UNRRA's "relief" in China. In February this year, UNRRA allowed the Chiang government to exchange US$49 million worth of relief supplies for marketable cotton and wheat to fund the civil war; this time, completely ceasing relief to the Liberated Areas at Chiang's request, while not completely ceasing relief to the Nationalist-controlled areas, is further clear evidence of UNRRA aiding Chiang in the civil war. The Chinese people are deeply indignant at UNRRA's actions. If UNRRA still wants to restore its credibility, which has been lost among the Chinese people, it can only immediately abandon its policy of unilaterally aiding Chiang, faithfully implement its policy of "fair and reasonable distribution of relief supplies regardless of political beliefs," and accept the reasonable demands of the Liberated Area Relief Association representatives.

### 评联总停止对解放区救济

　　评联总停止对解放区救济
    联总不顾解放区救济总会关于“公平合理分配救济物资”之历次呼吁，近已借口国民党封锁，决定自七月二十八日起，停止对解放区之救济，而仍继续运输救济物资给国民党地区。此项办法已于三十日在华盛顿公布，宣称：凡中国境内北纬三十四度以北地区，一律停止救济物资之输送，直至国民党“撤消反共封锁”或“联总撤消目前的决定”时为止。
    所谓“北纬三十四度以北”，即指大部分为人民解放军控制下之东北、华北、豫东及宿迁以北苏北等全部解放区而言。联总此项办法虽为其远东委员会所决定，但此种决定之不公平与不合理已甚显然。盖蒋介石政府利用联总善后救济物资进行内战，断不因北纬三十四度之分而有所不同，因此不能不使人怀疑到联总此项决定究为对谁而发。
    按七月初旬蒋政府曾以封锁解放区港口及限令联总人员悉数自解放区撤退为手段，企图彻底断绝救济物资进入解放区，以便利其全部垄断救济物资充作内战资本。解放为反对政府此种阴谋，曾向联总提出合理分配救济物资，并帮助直接运往解放区港口的新建议；指出不如此做，联总即失掉在中国存在之意义，则联总应“完全撒出中国”，方可保持其政治中立。但联总拒绝此项唯一合理而有效之步骤，反而采取上述中止对解放区救济办法。无论联总如何辩解，此举实已表示联总在巧妙的借口下，将救济物资的车轮推向完全片面援蒋内战的路子。
    据美联社上海讯：解放区救济总会驻沪办事处代理处长林仲，为此已于本月二日发表声明，表示解总坚决抗议联总此项援蒋内战行动，要求联总立即停止运往国民党港口的一切船只，冻结国民党仓库中的一切救济物资，以待问题的总解决。上海美商大美晚报亦对此表示不满，于一日著论谴责蒋政府违背“分配联总物资于全部不予歧视”的宣言，并责备：“如果中国不允许公平分配联总物资，为什么中国应该继续获得尚未分配的重要重工业物资？”指出“联总必须采取行动保卫其中立立场。”
    联总自在中国实行救济以来，即未能忠实于“不分种族宗教及政治信仰公平合理分配救济物资”宗旨，并将对华救济工作的国民党一手包办之行总的控制之下，使该项工作事实上成为国家内战之输血管。截止今年七月底止，联总运华之二百一十五万一千三百七十六吨物资中，解放区所得仅占百分之一点五三，而解放区因日寇侵华战争遭受灾难人民却达二千六百万，占全国全部难民四千二百万的一半以上；蒋政府所得巨量救济物资，大部分又被转用于内战，这就是联总在华“救济”之真象。今年二月联总允准蒋政府以四千九百万美元救济物资，换了可在市场出售之棉花小麦，以充内战经费；此次是从蒋意完全停止对解放区救济，而不完全停止对蒋管区救济一事，更为联总援蒋内战之明证。中国人民对联总此次行动深表愤慨，如果联总尚愿恢复其在中国人民中间的已丧失殆尽之信誉，只有立即放弃片面援蒋政策，忠实执行其“不分政治信仰公平合理分配救济物资”的方针，接受解总代表的合理要求。（八月九日）
