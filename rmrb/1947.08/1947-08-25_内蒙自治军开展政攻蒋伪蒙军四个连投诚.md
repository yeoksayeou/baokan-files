Xinhua News Agency, Northeast, 23rd: (Delayed) The southward-bound unit of the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Army in Jerim League (northern Liaobei Province) launched a powerful political offensive against Chiang Kai-shek's puppet Mongolian army. Tens of thousands of leaflets, appeals, and surrender passes were delivered to the ranks of the Chiang Kai-shek puppet army by their family members and friends, and posted and distributed in their garrison areas. The Inner Mongolia Autonomous Army was often hundreds of miles away, yet the Chiang Kai-shek puppet army had already seen their various propaganda materials. Despite being strictly prohibited by their superiors, the Chiang Kai-shek puppet officers and soldiers eagerly passed them around and came over in droves. On June 22nd, four companies, totaling more than 200 men, of the 2nd Regiment of the puppet Northeast Security Force's Independent Detachment, led by the regiment's Major Deputy Commander Gaerdi, Company Commander Battel Cang, and the detachment's directly subordinate mortar company's Major Company Commander Duanru Bukongmusu, voluntarily defected to the Democratic Allied Forces.

    【新华社东北二十三日电】（迟到）内蒙自治军南下某部在哲里木盟（辽北省北部）曾对蒋伪蒙军展开强大政治攻势，成千成万份传单、劝告书及投诚通行证经由其家属亲友投送至蒋伪军内部，在其驻军区域张贴散发，内蒙自治军往往远在数百里以外，蒋伪军即已看到他们的各种宣传品，蒋伪官兵虽在上级严禁之下无不争相传阅，纷纷来归。六月二十二日伪东北保安军独立支队二团四个连二百余人，即在该团少校团付嘎尔迪、连长巴特尔仓及支队直属迫击炮连少校连长端如布孔木苏等率领下，向民主联军自动投诚。
