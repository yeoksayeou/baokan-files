    Xinhua News Agency, Shandong, 31st – The Shandong Provincial Government and Relief Committee have lodged a serious protest with the UNRRA Dyke Three-Person Committee and the UNRRA China Office regarding Chiang bandit's announcement of a blockade of liberated areas' ports such as Yantai, Yangjiaogou, and Shijiusuo, preventing the entry of relief supplies into the liberated areas, and the continuous bombing of the Yellow River dyke in the Bohai area. Regarding the issue of relief supplies, the protest letter points out that previously, ships transporting relief supplies to the ports of the liberated areas were repeatedly bombed by Chiang's planes, which diverted the supplies to the Chiang-controlled areas. On the 9th of this month, after the UNRRA's "Wanqing" ship carrying relief supplies arrived at Yangjiaogou, the Chiang Kai-shek's naval vessel "Yongding" suddenly sailed to the outer port and conducted an armed inspection of the "Wanqing," preventing unloading. The captain even agreed to carry the supplies back to Shanghai. UNRRA has not taken effective action on this matter, which cannot but make people suspect whether UNRRA has adhered to the principle of non-political discrimination in relief and participated in the Chiang government's criminal conspiracy. Therefore, the following is requested: (1) UNRRA should effectively stop the Chiang government's blockade, inspection, and attacks on various ports in the liberated areas where relief supplies are loaded and unloaded, and ensure that relief supplies safely reach the liberated areas. Supplies transferred to other ports in the past should be quickly transported to the liberated areas. (2) The Liberated Area Relief General Office should establish direct relations with UNRRA to terminate the sabotage by the General Office. (3) Relief supplies should be distributed fairly according to the population, and the liberated areas should receive one-half of the total for China. The previous receipt of only 2% should be made up. Regarding the bombing of the Yellow River dyke, the protest letter states that from the 11th of this month, American-made Chiang planes have been bombing the river dykes in Huimin, Gaoyuan, Binxian, Putai, and Lijin counties day and night, and have not stopped as of the 19th. UNRRA has not only failed to stop this but has also tried to cover it up in various ways, which has puzzled the people along the river. The following is requested: (1) Immediately stop the Chiang government's actions of destroying the river dyke and ensure that such actions do not occur again in the future. (2) Issue dredging and dyke restoration and village relocation labor fees and supplies, and allocate additional relief supplies to aid the disaster victims along the river. (3) Officially publicize the Chiang government's crime of destroying the river dyke to clarify the truth. If the Yellow River is breached due to the Chiang government's destruction, the responsibility should be borne entirely by the Chiang side and UNRRA.

    山东省府抗议联总
    放任蒋党封锁阻拦救济物资
    联总应即制止蒋贼破坏河堤
    【新华社山东卅一日电】山东省府及救委会顷就蒋贼宣布封锁解放区烟台、羊角沟、石臼所等海口，阻止救济物资运入解放区，并连日轰炸勃海区黄堤等暴行，向联总堤岸三人委员会及联总中国分署提出严重抗议，关于救济物资问题，抗议书中指出：以往运送救济物资到解放区口岸之船只，即迭遭蒋机轰炸，而将物资转送蒋管区，本月九日，联总载运救济物资之万庆号开抵羊角沟后，突有蒋记军舰永定号驶至口外，对万庆号施行武装检查，阻止卸货，该船长竟允载回上海。联总对此迄未采取有效行动。不能不令人怀疑联总是否曾遵守救济不分政治差别的原则，参预蒋政府的罪恶阴谋，因此要求：（一）联总切实制止蒋政府对起卸救济物资的解放区各口岸的封锁检查与袭击，保证救济物资安全到达解放区。过去转运至其他口岸的物资，应从速运来解放区。（二）解总与联总建立直接关系，以终止总行从中破坏行为。（三）救济物资应按人口公平分配，解放区应得全中国的二分之一。过去仅收到百分之二，缺额应予补足。关于轰炸黄堤问题，抗议书称：本月十一日起，美造蒋机复连日连夜轰炸惠民、高苑、滨县、蒲台、利津等县河堤。截至十九日止，迄未停止。联总对此不但不加制止，反多方代为掩盖，沿河人民大感不解。要求：（一）立即制止蒋政府破坏河堤行动，并保证以后不再发生类此行为。（二）发清浚河复堤迁村工费及物资，并加拨救济物资，以救济沿河灾民。（三）将蒋政府此次破坏河堤的罪行正式公布，以明真相。如黄河因蒋政府破坏而决堤，其责任应全由蒋方及联总负之。
