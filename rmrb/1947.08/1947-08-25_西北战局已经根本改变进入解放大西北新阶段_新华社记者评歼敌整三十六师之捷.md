　　Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, August 23rd: A Xinhua News Agency reporter commented on the victory of the Northwest People's Liberation Army in annihilating the Hu Zongnan army's reorganized 36th Division, saying: The scale of this victory is unprecedented on the Northwest battlefield. The 36th Division was one of Hu Zongnan's three main divisions. Hu Zongnan's other main division, the reorganized 1st Division, had two brigades annihilated. Now Hu Zongnan only has one main division left, namely the reorganized 90th Division. Since May, after the victory of the Northwest People's Liberation Army in the Panlong battle, sweeping away the enemy in Longdong, Sanbian, and the periphery of Yulin, Hu Zongnan ordered his troops to divide their forces for "encirclement and suppression," ravaging the people of the liberated areas everywhere. He seemed to think that after the "encirclement and suppression," the people of the Shaanxi-Gansu-Ningxia Border Region could be forced to submit to him, and the People's Liberation Army could be easily dealt with. Little did he know that the people of the border region are invincible, and his "encirclement and suppression" yielded no results. The more fiercely Hu Zongnan's bandit army ravaged the people, the firmer the people's determination for revenge. When our army attacked Yulin, Hu Zongnan was forced to send troops from afar to aid, and also ordered his main force to advance rapidly northward, attempting to drive us into Shanxi; he even dared to penetrate into the Zhenchuanbao (30 li north of Mizhi) Xuexian line on the 20th of this month. Unexpectedly, our army started fighting near Zhenchuanbao and annihilated the 36th Division within a few hours. After the 36th Division was annihilated, Hu Zongnan's direct line troops only had fourteen brigades left, and his mobile force would not exceed seven brigades; moreover, because his rear was empty, it provided a great opportunity for the development of people's guerrilla warfare. The annihilation of the 36th Division marks this event: that is, the People's Liberation Army has already begun a counter-offensive on the Northwest battlefield. Chiang Kai-shek's major strategic error in occupying Yan'an has now come to the point of reaping its own bitter fruit. The Northwest war situation has fundamentally changed because of the annihilation of the 36th Division. The beginning of the Northwest People's Liberation Army's counter-offensive is also the beginning of a new stage in the liberation of the Great Northwest. This situation, coordinated with the counter-offensives on battlefields across the country, is extremely unfavorable to Chiang Kai-shek and extremely favorable to the Chinese people.

　　西北战局已经根本改变进入解放大西北新阶段
    新华社记者评歼敌整三十六师之捷
    【新华社陕北二十三日电】新华社记者评西北人民解放军歼灭胡宗南军整编第三十六师之胜利称：此次胜利的规模，在西北战场上是空前的。三十六师是胡宗南三个主力师之一，胡宗南的另一个主力师整编第一师被歼灭过两个旅，现在胡宗南只剩下一个主力师，即整编第九十师。自从五月以来，我西北人民解放军于蟠龙战斗胜利后，扫荡陇东、三边与榆林外围之敌，胡宗南乃令其军队分兵“清剿”，到处蹂躏解放区人民，他似乎以为经过了“清剿”，陕甘宁边区人民就可向他屈服，而人民解放军就可容易对付了。殊不知边区的人民是不可战胜的，他的“清剿”毫无结果。胡宗南匪军对人民的蹂躏愈凶，人民复仇的决心愈坚。及至我军攻榆林，胡宗南被迫派兵远道驰援，又令其主力急速北进，企图驱我入晋；竟敢于本月二十日深入到镇川堡（米脂北三十里）薛县一线。不料我军从镇川堡附近打起，几个钟头内即将三十六师歼灭。在三十六师被歼之后，胡宗南嫡系的兵力只余十四个旅，其机动兵力已不会超过七个旅；而且因为他的后方空虚，更给人民游击战争以广大发展的机会。三十六师的歼灭，标志着这样一件事：即是人民解放军在西北战场上业已开始反攻，蒋介石因进占延安而在战略上所犯的重大错误，现在已到自食其果的时候。西北战局因为三十六师的被歼，已经根本改变。西北人民解放军反攻的开始，也就是大西北解放之新阶段的开始。这一形势配合着全国各战场的反攻，是于蒋介石极端不利，而于中国人民极端有利的。
