Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 14th. American imperialism has formally announced that U.S. Marine Corps Corporal Pearson, the perpetrator who raped Shen Chong, a female student at Peking University last winter, is innocent. According to a United Press International dispatch from Washington, U.S. Navy Secretary Forrestal issued a statement on the 12th, rescinding Pearson's sentence. The statement attempts to distort the facts from the outset, referring to the victim, Shen Chong, as a "Chinese girl" without mentioning that she was a student at Peking University. It then sophistically argues that "the evidence against Pearson is not conclusive."

The U.S. military's Pearson atrocity occurred on the eve of Christmas, December 24th, last year. Miss Shen was abducted by Pearson and another U.S. soldier near Dongdan Square on her way to the Ping'an Theater. Miss Shen was raped twice by Pearson under duress. The atrocity caused an uproar worldwide. Under the public outrage of the Chinese people, the U.S. Marine Corps conducted a separate military court trial of Pearson in Beiping on January 17th this year, holding five sessions. The U.S. Navy's statement claimed that "the girl lingered with Pearson in an open space (?), next to a transportation artery for three hours. The girl only claimed to have been raped the next day, and according to examinations by Chinese and American doctors, there were no signs of abuse (?)" These shameless lies, which completely disregard the facts, are merely repetitions of the sophistry used by Pearson's defense lawyer in court. At the time, they were completely refuted as untenable by Chinese witnesses Wang Hecheng, Liu Zhihao, Zhang Yingjie, Ce Shaoming, Wang Tong, Guan Dejun, Meng Zhaojie, Qiang Zhixin, Ma Wenbin, Zhao Zetian, and U.S. military witnesses Clark, O'Dowd, Morris, Kinzer, and Otis, totaling fifteen people. On January 22nd, U.S. presiding judge Lieutenant Colonel Hughes announced that "U.S. Marine Corporal Pearson should be found guilty of consummated rape in the December 24th atrocity case in Dongdan, this city" (Central News Agency, January 22nd). Pearson also acquiesced. On March 3rd, Howard, commander of the 1st Marine Division, approved the court's verdict, sentencing the rapist "Pearson to be demoted to private and sentenced to fifteen years of imprisonment with hard labor." Pearson's shameless act aroused the indignation of all patriotic Chinese people. At that time, the "United Association to Protest U.S. Military Atrocities" and the "Shen Chong Incident Support Association" spread throughout the country. Chinese university and middle school students repeatedly defied the bloody suppression of the traitor Chiang Kai-shek, holding massive strikes, marches, and demonstrations in twenty-four major cities. Directly and indirectly, 500,000 students were involved in the movement, unanimously demanding the withdrawal of U.S. troops from China and opposing the U.S. policy of aggression against China. At that time, Chinese students also wrote to the United Nations, the Council of Foreign Ministers, and the American people, accusing the U.S. military of crimes and insisting that Pearson be submitted to the Chinese people for public trial and that U.S. troops stationed in China be withdrawn. This just demand of Chinese students was widely supported by all strata of society and responded to by democrats around the world. Even Yenching University's American professor John Leighton Stuart and Tsinghua University's American professor Winfield Riefler sympathized with the students' legitimate demands. Unexpectedly, after half a year, American imperialism dared to disregard world justice, humiliate China's national dignity, tear up its own verdict, reveal its hideous and shameless face, openly shield the rapist, and declare the U.S. military rapist "innocent." This is the result of Chiang Kai-shek's betrayal of the country and the U.S. imperialism's attempt to destroy China. It is further irrefutable proof that U.S. imperialism regards the Chinese people as worse than slaves. Every Chinese person who does not want to be a subjugated slave cannot tolerate this. They will fight even more bravely and fearlessly to drive U.S. imperialism out of China and end Chiang Kai-shek's traitorous rule!

　　美公然凌辱中国国格
  　沈崇案凶犯竟又宣告无罪
    【新华社陕北十四日电】美国帝国主义已正式宣布去冬强奸我北大女生沈崇之罪犯美海军陆战队伍长皮尔逊无罪。据合众社华盛顿电，美海军部长福莱斯特于十二日发表声明，撤销皮尔逊所受的判决。该声明一开头即企图歪曲事实，受害者沈崇为“中国女郎”而未提及其为北大女生，继复强词夺理谓“皮尔逊罪证不确凿。”
    按美军皮尔逊暴行，系发生于去年十二月廿四日耶诞节前夕，沈女士在赴平安戏院观剧途中，为美军皮尔逊及另一美军胁持至东单广场附近，沈女士在暴力下先后为皮尔逊两度强奸。暴行发生后，举世震动。在中国人民公愤下，美海军陆战队于今年一月十七日在北平开军事法庭单独自行审讯皮尔逊，先后开庭五次。美海军声明中所谓“该女郎会与皮尔逊于交通要道旁（？）之空地上，勾留三小时之久。该女郎于第二日方自谓被奸，而据中美医生检查结果，均无任何被蹂躏之征象（？）”等完全抹杀事实的无耻谎言，均系重复皮尔逊辩护人在法庭中的诡辩，当时已完全为我国证人王和成、刘志皓、张英杰、策绍明、王桐、关德俊、孟昭杰、强志新、马文彬、赵泽田等及美军证人克拉克、欧道、摩里斯、金泽、欧迪斯等十五人所驳复不能成立。一月二十二日美审判长休士中校宣布“美军伍长皮尔逊在本市东单十二月二十四日暴行案应为强奸已遂罪”（中央社一月二十二日电）时，皮尔逊亦俯首默认。三月三日美海军陆战队第一师司令霍华德遂核准该庭判决，判处强奸罪犯“皮尔逊降为普通兵士，处监禁劳役十五年”。皮尔逊此一无耻兽行，引起一切爱国的中国人悲愤填膺，当时“抗议美军暴行联合会”，“沈崇事件后援会”遍于全国。中国大、中、小学生曾一再冒卖国贼蒋介石的血腥镇压，在二十四个大城市举行轰轰烈烈的罢课游行示威，直接间接卷入运动的学生达五十万人，一致要求美军退出中国，反对美国侵华政策。当时全国学生并曾为此致书联合国组织、三国外长会议及美国人民等，控诉美军罪行，坚持将皮尔逊提交中国人民公审及撤退驻华美军。中国学生这一伸张正义的要求，普遍获得全国各阶层的支持及世界民主人士的响应，当时甚至燕大美籍教授夏仁德、清华美籍教授温生亦同情学生此一合理要求。不料事隔半年，美国帝国主义竟敢蔑视世界正义、凌辱中国国格，撕毁自己的判决，露出狰狞无耻面目，公然包庇强奸罪犯，宣布美军强奸犯“无罪”。这是蒋介石卖国与美帝国主义企图灭亡中国的结果，更是美国帝国主义视中国人民为奴隶不如的铁证。每一个不愿做亡国奴的中国人对此绝不能容忍，他们将更英勇无畏的为驱逐美帝国主义出中国与结束蒋介石卖国统治而奋斗！
