Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, August 13th: London dispatch: On the 10th, the London District Committee of the British Communist Party held a mass meeting of thousands of people in Hyde Park to protest the Labor government's reactionary domestic and foreign policies. The participants were filled with indignation and unanimously passed a resolution that clearly pointed out: "The 'emergency measures' announced by the government will never solve the crisis facing Britain. These measures are merely a continuation of the current disastrous policies and impose new and severe hardships on the people." The resolution demanded: "Stop this disastrous policy of pandering to American imperialism," "Establish close cooperation with the Soviet Union," "Britain withdraw from Greece," "Sever ties with Franco"... And called for the immediate implementation of a national economic plan, increasing wages, and reducing profits to suppress prices. At the meeting, another resolution was passed, vehemently condemning the Dutch imperialists' policy of massacring the Indonesian people, and the British government's aiding and abetting of the Netherlands. After the meeting, two thousand workers held a demonstration, marching along the main streets to central London. Workers held high banners with slogans such as "Don't sell Britain to Wall Street bosses!" The demonstrators also selected representatives to go to Attlee's residence and the Dutch Embassy in Britain to express their protest.

Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, August 14th: London dispatch: Attlee's economic plan, which attempts to further exploit the people to save the British economic crisis, has aroused widespread dissatisfaction among Labor Party members. On the 11th, Labor Party members held a special secret caucus. According to Reuters: 150 of the Labor Party's all members (393) were dissatisfied with Attlee's economic plan. During the meeting, members frankly criticized the Attlee plan, demanding decisions on the issues of nationalizing the steel industry and reducing British armed forces to deal with the economic crisis. As a result, by a vote of 81 to 77 (with 100 abstentions), a proposal to nationalize the steel industry was passed. Bevin was also forced to make an initial expression of agreement on the issue of disarmament. Qualified observers in London believe that Attlee's plan will not only fail to solve the British economic crisis, but also lead to a political crisis. Attlee was recently said to have considered resigning, and some changes in the cabinet are inevitable, otherwise the rising discontent within the Labor Party with the current government cannot be curbed. According to Reuters, the number of these dissidents is greater than the number of people gathered by the previous "opposition." The "left-wing" group of Labor Party members will continue to exist in the form of a committee during the parliamentary recess (from the 20th of this month to the end of October).

　　英共召开群众大会抗议政府反动政策
    工党议员对艾德礼普遍不满
    【新华社陕北十三日电】伦敦讯：十日，英共伦敦区党委在海德公园召开数千人之群众大会，抗议工党政府反动的内外政策。与会者满怀激愤，一致通过决议，明确指出：“政府宣布的‘紧急措施’，绝不能解决面对英国的危机，这种措施只是继续目前之灾难政策，并把新的严重困苦强加在人民身上。”决议要求：“停止这个阿谀美帝国主义的灾难政策”，“与苏联建立密切的合作”，“英国自希腊撤兵”，“与佛朗哥绝交”………。并呼吁立刻实行国民经济计划，增加工资，缩减利润以抑低物价。会上通过另一决议，猛烈谴责荷帝国主义屠杀印尼人民的政策，及英政府对荷兰的助纣为虐。会后，二千工人举行游行示威，沿主要街道向伦敦中心区前进，工人高举旗帜，上书“不要把英国出卖给华尔街老板！”游行者并选派代表，亲赴艾德里住宅及荷驻英大使馆表示抗议。
    【新华社陕北十四日电】伦敦讯：企图进一步压榨人民以挽救英经济危机之艾德里经济计划，激起工党议员之普遍不满。十一日，英工党议员举行党团特别秘密会议。据路透社讯：工党全部议员（三九三名）中有一百五十名不满艾德里经济计划。会中议员们率直的批评艾德里计划，要求对实行钢铁工业国有化及裁减英国武装部队两问题作出决定，以对付经济危机。结果，以八一票对七七票（一百票弃权），通过实行钢铁工业国有化的提案，贝文对裁军问题亦被迫作了同意的首次表示。伦敦有资格的观察家认为：艾德里计划不仅不能解决英国经济危机，而且招致了政治危机，艾德里日前曾有辞职之说，内阁不可避免的将有某些改变，否则不能遏止工党内部对现政府不满的高涨情绪。这些不满分子的人数，据路透社称：比以前“反对派”所集合的人数为多。工党议员的“左翼”集团，并将在国会休会期间（本月二十日至十月下旬）仍以一种委员会的组织形式继续存在。
