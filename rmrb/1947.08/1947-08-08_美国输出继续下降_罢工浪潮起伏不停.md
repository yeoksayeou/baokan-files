Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 4th: TASS, New York, 2nd: Numerous signs indicate that the exports upon which the high level of the American economy relies are now nearing a turning point. According to a report by the Department of Commerce, the total value of American exports in May was $1,422,200,000, which fell to $1,242,200,000 in June, a decrease of 13 percent. According to the Bureau of Statistics of the Department of Commerce, this decline is "the first major interruption in the rising trend of American exports." In the first half of this year, the total value of US exports reached $7,558,330,000, while imports were $2,862,600,000, resulting in a trade surplus of $4,695,730,000. The huge trade surplus has reduced other countries' dollar reserves, becoming a prelude to a further decline in exports. American government experts believe that the decline in exports in June "may be a turning point," while cautious estimates suggest that a major turning point may occur sometime in the second half of the year. Government experts agree that the decline is due to the rapid contraction of other countries' gold and dollar reserves, as well as foreign restrictions on purchasing American goods in order to conserve cash. Officials at the Department of Commerce estimate that foreign dollar and gold reserves decreased by at least $1 billion in the second quarter of this year. They estimate that foreigners currently hold $19 billion in gold assets, but the distribution is very uneven. They point out that Mexico, Sweden, and some South American countries have already limited their purchases of American goods, and other countries seem likely to follow suit. Britain is rapidly depleting the dollars in its American loan. According to the Associated Press, Britain used another $700 million in July, and the loan now has only about $1 billion left. It is generally expected that this loan will be completely drawn down within the year. News from London newspapers indicates that the British government is considering various measures to conserve its dwindling dollar supply.

Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 2nd: Washington dispatch: Before and after Truman's mid-year economic report boastfully spoke of so-called "industrial peace," the American strike movement continued to rise and fall. The United Automobile Workers Union, affiliated with the CIO, announced on July 31 that 60,000 auto workers are about to go on strike. At the same time, more than 20,000 workers at Ford Motor Company have already gone on strike. The strike by the Transport Workers Union of New York, affiliated with the CIO, is still ongoing. And some other strike struggles have ended with the victory of the workers. The strike by more than 10,000 pier workers in Balomey, affiliated with the International Longshore and Warehouse Union, ended on July 31 with a partial satisfaction of the workers' demands and a return to work. The strike by more than 3,000 independent train drivers, which began on July 20, was finally resolved with fifteen out of more than a dozen demands being met.

    美国输出继续下降
    罢工浪潮起伏不停
    【新华社陕北四日电】塔斯社纽约二日电：许多迹象表示，美国高度经济所赖以支持的输出，现已接近转折点。据商务部报告，美输出总额五月份为十四亿二千二百万元，六月份降至十二亿四千二百万元，下降了百分之十三。据商务部统计局称：此次下降为“美输出上升趋势中的首次重大中断。”今年上半年美国输出总额共达七十五亿五千八百卅万元，输入则为二十八亿六千二百六十万元，出超四十六亿九千五百七十万元。巨额出超减少了他国的美元外汇，成为输出进一步下降的前奏。美政府专家认为六月输出下降“可能为一转捩点”，审慎的估计则认为大的转捩点可能在下半年某时发生。政府专家一致认为，下降是由于其他国家黄金及美元储存的迅速紧缩，以及国外因保全现金而限制购买美货。商务部官员估计，今年第二季国外美元及黄金储藏至少减少十亿元。他们估计，外国现尚握有一百九十亿元黄金资产，但分布很不平衡。他们指出，墨西哥、瑞典及南美某些国家已在限购美货，其他各国似乎亦将继起效法。英国正迅速耗尽其美国贷款中的美元。据美联社称，七月份英国又支用了七亿元，目前贷款仅剩约十亿元之谱。一般预计，此项贷款年内将被全部提空。伦敦报界消息称，英政府正在考虑各种措施，以保存日趋枯竭的美元供应。
    【新华社陕北二日电】华盛顿讯：在杜鲁门年中经济报告中侈谈所谓“工业和平”之前后，美国罢工运动仍此起彼伏。产联所属之汽车工人联合会七月三十一日宣布，汽车工人六万人即将举行罢工。同时福特公司已有二万余工人实行罢工。产联纽约交通工人联合会的罢工仍持续中。而其他若干罢工斗争已以工人之胜利而结束。产联码头工人工会所属的万余名波罗密工人的罢工，已于上月三十一日以局部满足工人要求而复工，上月二十日开始的三千余名独立火车司机工会的罢工，最后以十几条要求满足十五条而告解决。
