　　Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 15th: Reports from various sources: The US imperialists' plot to unilaterally convene a peace treaty conference on Japan in order to monopolize Japan, although delayed due to Soviet rejection, has not died out. According to a Reuter dispatch from London on the 9th by the Chiang-controlled Central News Agency: The US State Department has for the second time suggested holding a preliminary eleven-nation peace treaty conference on Japan in Washington in September, and Britain is considering its response. Regarding this reckless act by the United States in violation of the Four Powers agreement, Chiang Kai-shek is respectful and supportive. Gu Weijun, the Chiang government's ambassador to the United States, shamelessly stated when he met with US Assistant Secretary of State Humelsine on the 7th: "China (Chiang) welcomes the US suggestion to convene a preliminary eleven-nation peace treaty conference on Japan as soon as possible, and has no objection to the conference being held in Washington or San Francisco." Another Central News Agency dispatch from Washington on the 7th revealed: "China (Chiang) can accept the two-thirds majority voting method advocated by the United States, but it must include the consent of three of the four powers." This shows that the Chiang government is completely following its foreign daddy in abandoning the previously established principle of the Four Powers veto.

　　美独占日本野心未死
    仍企图片面召开对日和会
  　蒋政府随声附和无耻已极
    【新华社陕北十五日电】各方讯：美帝国主义片面召开对日和约会议以便独占日本之阴谋，虽因苏联拒绝而告延期，但至今并未死心。据蒋记中央社伦敦九日专电透露：美国务院第二次建议于九月间在华盛顿召开十一国对日和约初步会议，英正考虑答复中。对于美国此种违反四强协定之妄举，蒋介石则唯恭唯敬予以赞助，蒋政府驻美大使顾维钧于七日晤美助理国务卿亚莫尔时，无耻表示：“中国（蒋）欢迎美方尽早召开十一国对日和约初步会议之建议，会议在华盛顿或旧金山召开均不反对”。另据中央社华府七日专电泄露：“美国主张之三分之二大多数表决法，中国（蒋）可以接受，但须包括四强之三的同意。”此显示蒋政府完全尾随其洋爸爸抛弃早所确定的四强否决权原则。
