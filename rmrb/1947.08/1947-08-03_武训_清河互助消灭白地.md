(From our Jinnan correspondent) Wu Xun cadres went to the countryside to investigate wasteland. After the county conducted a "reasonable burden" assessment, they discovered a lot of uncultivated land. The fourth, fifth, and eighth districts each had 3,000 mu, and other districts also had one or two hundred qing. Much of this was land with undistributed harvests, or belonging to the elderly, weak, orphaned, or widowed. Now, cadres in each district are mobilizing to investigate wasteland and lead the effort to eliminate it. In Zhaoziying, in the seventh district, 30 mu of undistributed land was lying fallow. Ma Jinming, the director of the farmers' association, borrowed seeds, livestock, and farm tools to plant it all, saying, "If the land is distributed to the masses with green seedlings, it is my fault if the land is left uncultivated." Qinghe is determined to eliminate all kinds of uncultivated land. Shizhuang organized all the labor in the village into eight groups and implemented labor exchange to rush planting, planting 361 mu in two days. Sunwa quickly planted more than 60 mu of land confiscated from landlords but not yet distributed, completing the planting in two days. Under the leadership of the militia captain, the villagers of Sunjiazhuang planted 128 mu of vegetables. Donghonghe mobilized the entire village, cooperating through mutual aid to plant 284 mu and replant 164 mu. Elementary school students in Changhandian replanted four mu of seedlings for military dependent Chang Kegui in one day. After discovering 172 mu of uncultivated land in Huangzhaotou, the cadres took the lead and eliminated all the uncultivated land in three days.
