　　[This dispatch from Yexian] On August 1st, at dawn, the enemy's 40th Division supplementary regiment in Anyang, colluding with local bandits Wang Ziquan, Guo Qing, and other remnants, advanced to the Cuiqiaocun, Wulonghua, and Anyangtun areas of Yexian County. Our county brigade immediately deployed its positions and launched a blocking operation, putting forward the slogan "Don't fight if there are too few enemies, don't shoot if you can't aim accurately." When Platoon Leader Li discovered the enemy charging, he quickly directed the machine guns and rifles to fire at the enemy, repelling the enemy's four charges against our position. After three hours of fierce fighting, we safely transferred. In this battle, a total of 32 enemies were killed or wounded, one was captured alive, and one rifle and 125 rounds of ammunition were seized. We only suffered two casualties, creating a brilliant record of one to sixteen ratio. In summarizing this battle, our county brigade launched a merit evaluation campaign, and a total of four special-class models were selected: Zhang Hegui, Lin Louxiu, Wu Qilin, Wang Zhongru, etc., and each class in the first company was credited with one major merit, Li Shuyou and other eight people were credited with one major merit each, Wang Shizhen and other three people were credited with two minor merits each, and Wang Baozhen and other eleven people were credited with one minor merit each. After this battle and the merit evaluation, everyone's enthusiasm was extremely high, and everyone shouted that they would fight more beautiful battles in the future. (Ke Qiang, Zhang Xi)
　　[This dispatch from Yexian] A part of the enemy's 40th Division in Anyang, colluding with local bandits Wang Ziquan, Guo Qing, etc., with four to five thousand people, constantly harassed our Second District. Our Second District District Cadre Team and Armed Work Team immediately sought the enemy's gaps to launch guerrilla warfare. The Chai Wusheng Armed Work Team arrived at Yibancun on the 27th of last month before dark and drove away the enemies who were looting grain in the village. Li Jianxue led the political team of the Armed Work Team to Jin Sizhuang on the 28th. As soon as the enemies left the village, they entered the village and captured Jin Shufang, the landlord of the village who had returned to his hometown. Zhang Baozhong's Armed Work Team operated in Gezhuang on the 30th and encountered more than 20 enemies who were looting grain in the village. The enemy sentry asked, "Which unit are you from?" The answer was: "Plainclothes team!" Asked: "Where did you come from!" The answer was: "From Honghetun!" Under such a dangerous situation, our work team continued to advance, and immediately opened fire after approaching the enemy, giving the enemy a surprise attack and causing the enemy to flee in panic. As a result, one enemy was wounded and a lot of grain was intercepted. On the evening of August 1st, our Second District District Cadre Team cooperated with Comrade Liu Guo's Armed Work Team to attack the enemy in Xindianji. After approaching the market, they threw two grenades, and the enemy retaliated fiercely with machine guns. When we fought back, the enemies panicked and ran around, and only gathered together in Nanwangzhuang, several miles south of the market. At this time, we entered Xindianji, took a walk around, and then withdrew automatically. On the morning of August 2nd, the enemy in Xindian was divided into two groups to harass. One group went to Muchangtun, Fenglezhen, and Jijiazhuang, and the other group went to Daotian. Our district cadre team cooperated with Du Erbao's Armed Work Team to launch an assault on the enemy in Daotian. Two enemies were killed and five were wounded. As a result, they were defeated and fled in embarrassment, running all the way to the direction of Xindianji. The enemies in Muchangtun also ran away under the pressure of our armed work team. In total, from July 27th to August 2nd, in one week, one big landlord, two enemy agents, and two maintenance offenders were captured, three enemies were killed, five were wounded, and grain was intercepted three times.
