Xinhua News Agency, Northeast, 10th: Over the past six months, government and school organs in East and West Manchuria have vigorously practiced production and frugality, largely achieving self-sufficiency in funding. Since May, the Hei-Nen Provincial Government has been completely self-sufficient in expenses such as office supplies, miscellaneous expenses, and food costs, providing over 47,300 catties of vegetables per month and 4.37 million yuan for office supplies and miscellaneous expenses. Currently, efforts are also being made to achieve self-sufficiency in clothing and fuel. The West Manchuria branch of the Military and Political University reduced its non-essential staff by 60, saving 9 million yuan annually. The directly subordinate teams of the Yanbian sub-district of Jilin cultivated over 320 *xiang* of land, opened three workshops and one cooperative, with enough income to be fully self-sufficient.
