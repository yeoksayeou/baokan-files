    The Mouths Captured the Stronghold
    Luan Ya, Lin Feng
    In a village in Nantong, over eighty emancipated peasant households, under the leadership of the publicly elected Chief of Staff Qu Maolin, devised a plan to capture the Jiang-puppet stronghold at Lan'gang Bridge nearby. Qu Maolin first suggested, "The troops use guns to attack the stronghold, but we don't have guns, we use our mouths." Everyone gave full play to their wisdom, arranged the "battle," and began the action. First, they held a mobilization meeting in the village for the families of the Jiang-puppets. At the meeting, the peasants, in groups of three to five, earnestly discussed the victorious situation of the People's Liberation Army with the Jiang-puppet families, pointing out that the Jiang-puppets had no way out. They also explained the leniency policy of the democratic government and the people, saying, "Except for Yu Guihua, the Jiang-appointed township head who is guilty of heinous crimes, others are guaranteed not to be killed upon their return, and those who are guilty will be treated leniently." More than thirty Jiang family members were persuaded to weep bitterly, saying, "We must do everything possible to bring them back." However, the Jiang family members returned disappointed after going to the Lan'gang Bridge stronghold. It turned out that Yu Guihua and the Jiang-appointed security captain had stipulated, "No one is allowed to open the gate without orders." Chief of Staff Qu Maolin and the peasants then held another meeting for the Jiang-puppet families to come up with ideas. The next day, more than thirty of them went to the sentry post of the stronghold. When the sentries saw their relatives, and thinking that the "captain" and "township head" were all drinking and gambling in the street, they hurriedly opened the gate. The Jiang family members, with their children and elderly mothers, rushed in to greet their relatives. For a time, every corner of every barracks was filled with weeping and sobbing, with cries of, "I will die here if you don't come home!" By nightfall, thirty-two local Jiang soldiers had returned to the village to confess to the masses. Apart from a security detachment, only five members of the self-defense force remained at Lan'gang Bridge. The township militia took the opportunity to harass them, and on the fifth day, finally forced the security detachment to flee in panic. The peasants excitedly said, "We didn't have guns, but we captured the stronghold with our mouths!"

    嘴巴打下了据点
    孪涯  林枫
    南通某村八十多户翻身农民在公推的参谋长瞿茂林领导下，大家设计要打下附近滥港桥蒋伪据点。瞿茂林先出主意“部队用枪攻据点，我们没枪用嘴巴”，大家充分发挥智慧，布置“战斗”，开始行动，首先在村里开了蒋伪家属动员会，会上农民三五成群的和蒋伪家属们恳谈解放军胜利形势，指出蒋伪绝无出路，并解释民主政府和人民的宽大政策说：“除罪大恶极的蒋记乡长于贵华以外，别人回来保证不杀，有罪的从轻处理”，三十多个蒋属被农民劝说得号淘大哭说：“千万个主意都要把人拖回来。”但蒋属们到滥港桥据点后都失望而归，原来是于贵华和蒋记保安队长已规定“没有命令不准开门”。参谋长瞿茂林和农民们就又给蒋伪家属开会想办法，第二天三十多齐到据点岗哨上去，站岗的看见了亲人，又想“队长”、“乡长”们都正在街上酗酒打牌，就连忙开栅蒋属带上孩子、老母一个相迎，蒋属们蜂拥而进，各找亲人，一时每个营房的角落里都在哀哀啜泣，到处哭叫着：“你不回家我就死在这里！”入夜三十二个土蒋陆续回到村里向群众自新。滥港桥除一个保安分队外，自卫队只剩下了五个人。乡武工队趁机袭扰，第五天终于逼使保安分队狼狈逃窜。农民们兴奋的说：“我们没枪用嘴巴打下了据点！”
