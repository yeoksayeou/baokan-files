    Xinhua News Agency, Northeast China, 5th -- In Harbin, women account for more than two-thirds of the people participating in the movement to liquidate enemy and puppet distribution stores. Many women have been elected as members of the liquidation committee; in Xinyang District alone, there are more than ten. In supporting the front lines, women actively participate. In the past six months, they have mobilized more than one hundred doctors and nurses to serve in hospitals at the front and rear. They have mobilized more than ten thousand families of women to participate in spinning, shoemaking, and sewing, and have organized more than one thousand women to participate in literacy classes. In state-owned enterprises and ironworks, a large number of female labor models have emerged. Wei Zhongxiu, a female worker at the Harbin Ironworks, has won medals twice and was elected as a first-class labor hero among more than 2,300 workers.
    The urban and rural spinning movement is actively underway. In Qiqihar, there are already more than 2,400 spinning households, with plans to expand to 10,000 households. In Harbin's Dongchuanjia District alone, there are 1,400 spinning women. In Jilin, Heqing, Tumen, and other places, since the beginning of July, more than 3,680 spinning women have been added. In Yanji City's Badao Township, Li Shanshu's family of four, since being mobilized to participate in spinning in early October last year, has woven 540 yards of cloth. After setting aside 40 yards for their own use, they bought 7.5 mu of paddy fields and 7.2 shi of millet, with a surplus of 275,000 yuan, enough for a year's worth of food and expenses.
