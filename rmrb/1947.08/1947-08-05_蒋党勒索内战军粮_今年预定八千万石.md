Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 2nd: According to reports from the Central News Agency and the Associated Press: The grain conference of Chiang Kai-shek's little dynasty, "paving the way for the (Chiang) government to collect military grain and lay railways" (Associated Press), concluded on July 31st, having passed the "Implementation Measures for the Collection of Actual Land Tax and Grain Loans in the 36th Year." This grain conference decided to more brutally plunder the people's grain. The total amount of requisitioned loans, the Chiang Kai-shek authorities, fearing popular resistance, dared not announce. The Central News Agency reported only that it had been negotiated with various provinces. According to the Associated Press, the conference aimed to collect 40 million *shi* of grain and borrow 20 million to 30 million *shi*. (Note: The actual figure is definitely more than this.) The "Measures" also stipulated that the provincial and county surcharges on public grain should still be 30% of the amount collected. Thus, according to the Associated Press's estimate, in addition to bearing the land tax and military grain of 60 to 70 million *shi*, the people would also have to bear approximately 12 million *shi* of land tax surcharges, totaling 70 to 80 million *shi*. The "Measures" also stipulated the restoration of the provincial and municipal land grain offices, county land grain offices, township offices, and large numbers of institutions for storage and transportation, which had been opposed by the people and once abolished. The heavy expenses such as "recurring expenses," "living allowances," "printing costs for land tax forms," "collection operating expenses," and "acceptance tool fees" would all be "added to the budget" and borne by the people separately from the land tax. It also stated that "responsible personnel in provinces, cities, and counties should go to various places to supervise the collection" and that "those who fail to handle matters effectively should be severely punished according to the law."

    蒋党勒索内战军粮
    今年预定八千万石
    【新华社陕北二日电】据中央社及美联社讯：“为（蒋）政府收集军粮铺平铁道”（美联社语）的蒋家小朝廷的粮食会议，已于七月三十一日通过“三十六年度田赋征实暨征借粮食实施办法，同日会议已闭幕。这次粮食会议决定更残暴的搜刮人民粮食，征借总数，蒋家当局慑于人民反抗，竟不敢公布，中央社报导仅谓已和各省洽定。据美联社称：该会议目标为征粮四千万石，征借二千万至三千万石。（按：实际决不止此数）该办法复规定，省县附加公粮仍为征实数额之三成，如此即按美联社估计来算，人民除负担田赋及军粮六七千万石外，又须负担一千二百万石左右的田赋附加，合计已为七、八千万石。该“办法”又规定恢复过去为人民所反对而一度取消的各省市田粮处、各县田粮处、各乡镇办事处及收纳仓库与运输方面的大堆机关，其‘经常费’、‘生活补助费’‘田赋单册串票印制费’、‘征收事业费’及验收工具费”等繁重开支，一概“追加预算”，由人民在田赋之外另行负担。并称“各省、市、县主管人员，应分赴各地督征”，“有办理不力者，应依法从严惩处”。
