Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 9th -- A certain military observer here recently spoke to reporters about the General Headquarters of the People's Liberation Army (PLA)'s communiques on the achievements of the past year, stating: The PLA's various communiques provide reliable data for studying the military changes of the past year and predicting future development trends. The figures in the communiques are very cautious and consistent with the facts that people are aware of. Chiang's regular army originally had 253 brigades, reduced to 248 brigades after reorganization, equivalent to approximately 744 regiments, with an actual strength of about 1.8 million soldiers; its non-regular army comprised approximately 732 regiments, with an actual strength of about 1.1 million soldiers; the total was 1,476 regiments, with a strength of 2.9 million soldiers. According to the PLA's communiques, Chiang's army has lost 420 regiments in the one-year war, with a strength of 1.12 million soldiers, meaning a construction loss of slightly less than one-third and a strength loss of slightly more than one-third. The Chiang army nominally attacking the liberated areas and the guerrilla zones in the Central Plains and South China still numbers 227 brigades, but in reality, some brigades have not been replenished after being annihilated, and some brigades, although replenished, are not yet capable of combat. It is estimated that the 2.9 million Chiang soldiers have replenished approximately 1 million new recruits in the past year. Subtracting the loss of 1.12 million soldiers, and further subtracting at least one-tenth for desertions, the Chiang army's current strength is at most only 2.5 million soldiers (of which the regular army is estimated to be about 1.5 million soldiers). Even if replenishment does not decrease and losses do not increase in the coming year (these two assumptions are not easy to realize, given the shrinking Chiang-controlled areas and the decreasing number of Chiang's veteran soldiers and increasing number of new recruits), the Chiang army's strength will continue to decrease to 2.2 million soldiers a year later. However, the Chiang army's biggest crisis lies not in becoming smaller with each battle, but in becoming weaker with each battle. The PLA's communiques indicate that from the initial stage of the past year (the first four months) to the final stage (the last four months), the Chiang army's attacking strength decreased from a peak of 117 brigades to 40 brigades; the ratio of Chiang army prisoners to casualties increased from slightly less than 1:1 to more than 2:1; the ratio of Chiang army losses to PLA losses increased from 2.45:1 to 3.5:1; the number of cities gained or lost changed from Chiang's army gaining 105 cities to the PLA gaining 58 cities. These eloquent figures fully demonstrate that the Chiang army is becoming weaker with each battle, and also fully demonstrate that the PLA is becoming stronger with each battle. The PLA's casualty number is slightly less than four-fifths of the Chiang army's casualty number, and the difference is not very large; however, the total number of Chiang soldiers captured and won over by the PLA (694,000) is more than 30 times higher than the total number of PLA soldiers captured and lost (22,000). The PLA captured 202 Chiang army generals, while the Chiang army gained nothing in this regard. This astonishing feature of the war best demonstrates the disparity in morale between the two sides. Although the total PLA losses for the year amounted to 358,000, approximately 200,000 of them recovered from their injuries and returned to their units, and the PLA also gained 677,000 captured Chiang soldiers and 17,000 Chiang soldiers who defected. Even calculating only half of the prisoners as replenishment, the gains still exceed the losses over the year. In addition, local troops and guerrillas in the liberated areas are promoted to the main force, and liberated peasants in the liberated areas enthusiastically join the army. Therefore, the PLA is not only becoming stronger with each battle but also growing larger with each battle. The PLA's acquisition of a large number of enemy prisoners and enemy uprisings, a large number of casualties returning to their units, and a large number of people voluntarily participating all have their political basis, which the Chiang army cannot have. Based on these objective facts, one side is becoming stronger with each battle, and the other side is becoming weaker and smaller with each battle. It is not difficult for people to make a scientific judgment about the future outcome.

### 陕北军事观察家谈总部五项公报　蒋军日衰我军益强  人民爱国自卫战争必胜

　　陕北军事观察家谈总部五项公报
  　蒋军日衰我军益强
    人民爱国自卫战争必胜
    【新华社陕北九日电】此间某军事观察家顷就解放军总部所发一年战绩公报对记者谈称：解放军总部的各项公报，供给了研究过去一年军事变化与推测未来发展趋势的可靠资料。公报的数字均极谨慎，并与人们所确知的事实相符合。按蒋正规军原有二百五十三个旅，整编后减为二百四十八个旅，约合七百四十四个团，实有兵力约一百八十万人；其非正规军约合七百三十二个团，实有兵力约一百一十万人；两者只一千四百七十六个团，兵力二百九十万人。据解放军公报，在一年战争中蒋军已损失四百二十个团，兵力一百十二万人，即建制损失三分之一弱，兵力损失三分之一强。现进攻解放区及中原、华南游击区的蒋军名义上仍为二百二十七个旅，实则其中若干旅被歼后尚未补充，若干旅虽经补充尚不能作战，估计二百九十万蒋军在过去一年中补充新兵约一百万人，减去损失一百十二万人，再减去至少十分之一的逃亡，则蒋军现有兵力至多还只有二百五十万人（内正规军据估计约为一百五十万人）。即令将来一年中补充并不减少，损失亦不增加（这两个假定，在蒋管区日益缩小和蒋军老兵日少、新兵日多的条件下，是不易实现的），一年以后蒋军兵力亦将续减为二百二十万人。但蒋军最大危机还不在愈战愈小，而在愈战愈弱。解放军公报表示，从过去一年的最初阶段四个月到最后阶段四个月，蒋军攻击兵力由一百十七个旅的最高点降为四十个旅；蒋军被俘数比伤亡数由一比一弱升为二比一强；蒋军损失比解放军损失由二点四五比一升为三点五比一；城市得失数由蒋军得一百零五座变为解放军得五十八座；这些雄辩的数字，充分说明了蒋军愈战愈弱，也充分说明了解放军的愈战愈强。解放军的伤亡数为蒋军伤亡数五分之四弱，相差尚不甚远；但解放军俘虏及争取蒋军的总数（六十九万四千人）则高过解放军被俘失散总数（二万二千人）三十倍以上。解放军俘虏蒋军将级军官二百零二名，蒋军在这一方面则毫无所获。战争的这个令人惊异的特点，最足表现双方士气的悬殊。解放军全年损失统计虽达三十五万八千人，但内有约二十万人伤愈归队，又得俘虏蒋军六十七万七千人、反正蒋军一万七千人，即仅以俘虏半数作为补充计算，一年得失相较还有超过，加以解放区地方军游击队升为主力军和解放区翻身农民踊跃参军，因此解放军不但愈战愈强，而且愈战愈大；解放军得到敌军俘虏和敌军起义的大量补充，得到伤亡大量归队，得到人民大量自愿参加，这三个条件都有其政治的基础，是蒋军所不能有的。根据这些客观事实，一方愈战愈强大，一方愈战愈弱小，前途胜败如何，人们自不难作出科学的判断。
