Xinhua News Agency, Northwest, 19th—In the ninety-mile "encirclement and suppression" zone from Yan'an to Panlong, the People's Guerrilla Force moved through the points and lines of Chiang's troops, achieving repeated victories. On July 14th, a certain squad of the guerrilla force ambushed a battalion of Chiang's troops that came out of Panlong to harass the area at Baijiaping, fighting fiercely for four hours. On the 21st, a certain platoon of the guerrilla force achieved three victories in one day, successively defeating a regiment, a company, and another vanguard platoon of Chiang's troops at Lujiatun. On the 24th, a certain detachment of the guerrilla force ambushed a battalion of Chiang's infantry and an artillery company at Zhuta, fighting fiercely for a whole day. Chiang's troops were unable to withstand the attack, dragging more than ten corpses and wounded soldiers as they fled in disarray. The guerrilla force pursued them directly to the front of Chiang's military stronghold in Panlong. In addition, the guerrilla force also organized several capable and experienced small groups to cooperate with the armed work teams to maneuver around the enemy near the blockhouses, destroy the baojia system, and strike at small groups of enemy troops. On the 20th, they captured two Chiang soldiers in one swoop at Chuanshangping. On another occasion, more than ten members of a worker's guerrilla team adopted the "tail-cutting" tactic, also capturing six Chiang soldiers and killing one.
