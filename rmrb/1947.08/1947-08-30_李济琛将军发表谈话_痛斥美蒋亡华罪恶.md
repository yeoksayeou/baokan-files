Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, August 28th: General Li Jishen, currently residing in Hong Kong, vehemently denounced Wedemeyer's aid to Chiang Kai-shek to destroy China, and Chiang Kai-shek's betrayal of the nation, which deepened the suffering of the Chinese people. According to a TASS dispatch from Nanjing on the 26th, Li, in a statement published in the China Business Daily, said: "Since Wedemeyer's arrival in China, the Chinese people have closely watched whether the United States will change its policy towards China. In the past two years, the U.S. government has supplied the Chinese dictatorial government with large amounts of weapons and money to fuel the civil war, thus sowing the seeds of deep disaster and death for the Chinese people. And the U.S. government has obtained many privileges that harm China's independence and freedom, and the numerous atrocities of the U.S. military in China have never been restrained in the slightest. The U.S. government, in violation of allied agreements, is promoting the revival of Japanese aggression forces, threatening China's survival. All these facts cannot but make the Chinese people believe that the U.S. policy towards China is hostile to the Chinese people and attempts to colonize China. The Chinese people had hoped for a fundamental change in U.S. policy towards China. Since Wedemeyer's arrival in China, apart from the news that the United States has obtained certain strategic bases from the Chinese (Chiang) government, that the National (Chiang) army has been trained in Taiwan, and that the United States has demanded that the Chinese Chiang government pass a resolution to restore trade with Japan, there has been no symbolic indication of a change in U.S. policy. We must point out that Wedemeyer's mission is to find effective ways to harm the Chinese people. Since the Chinese dictatorial government disregards the hunger and death of the people and conducts a civil war, using the method of 'total mobilization' to squeeze the last drop of blood from the people, and disregards the increasingly dilapidated national industry and commerce, and obeys the U.S. opinion to restore trade with Japan, then it is very clear that it will continue to prolong its dictatorial rule at the cost of national humiliation and slavery. The Chinese people deeply love democracy and peace, and at present the Chinese people have enough awareness to understand their own wishes. If this wish of the Chinese people is not taken into account, then the China problem cannot be solved. If the United States does not change its current policy and continues to support the side of dictatorship and civil war, then the Chinese people will fight to the end in accordance with Sun Yat-sen's teachings."

TASS, Moscow, August 25th: Malinin, an international affairs observer for Pravda, commented on Wedemeyer's mission to China: "General Wedemeyer, the wartime commander of the U.S. military in China and Chiang Kai-shek's chief of staff, has come to China again with a special mission. The U.S. President's choice of special envoy to China is definitely limited to senior military officers, which can be said to have become a real standard. According to Wedemeyer's repeated statements: his mission is to be responsible for the cautious task of 'investigating the facts,' and when he returns to Washington, these fact-findings will serve as a blueprint for formulating U.S. policy towards China. As expected, General Wedemeyer concealed the point that his coming to China was not because he did not know some facts that have become characteristics of the Chinese situation, but on the contrary, because he knew them too well. Wedemeyer's coming to China is not to investigate the situation, but to change it. The China Weekly Review wrote: There is no doubt that the actual difficulty facing Wedemeyer is whether to give the Chinese government economic 'aid' or undisguised military aid. The question is whether the 'aid' to China should follow the Greek model (Truman Doctrine) or the Western European model (Marshall Plan). However, the 'China Weekly Review' distorts the facts by looking at the Truman Doctrine and the Marshall Plan symmetrically. Wedemeyer's mission presents the clearest evidence that this symmetrical view is unfounded. As is well known, the recent offensive launched by the Kuomintang against the democratic forces with countless U.S. military and economic aid has failed shamefully. The Kuomintang leaders are not satisfied with this and are preparing a new offensive and placing their last hope on more U.S. military and economic aid. A recent Chinese newspaper stated: The main task of the Wedemeyer mission is to buy time for a complete reorganization of the Kuomintang army, so that once its reorganization and training are completed, it will launch an irresistible offensive against the democratic forces. Therefore, the real purpose of General Wedemeyer's special mission to China is far from a simple 'fact-finding'."

Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, August 28th: News from various sources proves that the main purpose of Wedemeyer's departure statement is only to whip the Chiang family's small court to quickly improve and strengthen its civil war apparatus according to the wishes of the United States, and attempt to find some way to win the time needed for Chiang Kai-shek to carry out this kind of "improvement" and "strengthening". On the 25th, the New York Times, the mouthpiece of American imperialism, in an editorial commenting on Wedemeyer's statement, clearly revealed that the purpose of Wedemeyer's demand for reform of the Chiang regime is to enable the Kuomintang to have the strength to "end the civil war by force." The newspaper called Wedemeyer's statement "a pathetic letter of admonishment to Chiang Kai-shek's Nationalist government" and "advice," saying "if this kind of national (referring to the Chiang family's small court) hope and confidence is not restored, there is no hope of ending the civil war by force"; saying "Chiang's arrangement of window dressing is not enough in Wedemeyer's opinion." Sun Ke, the most shameless vice-president of the Kuomintang, also stated in Guangzhou on the 26th in his "impressions" of Wedemeyer's statement: Wedemeyer's call for the Kuomintang to "eliminate corruption" is sufficient to "win over the people" and "defeat the Communist Party." In other news, after Wedemeyer's statement was issued, the Chiang family's small court was busy making a mess, putting on a show of "eliminating corruption", attempting to use this to show its enthusiasm for carrying out its master's orders. The Chiang government, on the 25th, the day after Wedemeyer's statement, hurriedly ordered the strict implementation of the "Regulations on Punishing Corruption". Chiang's Executive Yuan also renewed its "determination to remove cowardly, incompetent and corrupt officials". Chiang's Control Yuan declared that it "will strengthen supervision and impeachment," while Chiang's Ministry of Finance sent officials to "investigate corruption" and have arrived in Shanghai, saying that it has been discovered that the Shanghai Tax Bureau has extorted more than 100 million yuan in "legal tender" from several furniture merchants. It is believed that a series of farcical plays of "patting flies" will be constantly staged, while the biggest corrupt elements, the Chiang, Song, Kong, and Chen families, the political science system group, and their cronies, will use this to report their merits to their American daddy and ask for rewards, and continue to engage in endless corruption.

Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, August 28th: According to reports from United Press and Associated Press Shanghai on the 26th, the Shanghai market was in chaos again within 24 hours of Wedemeyer's departure from China. Prices on the stock market and commodity market both rose sharply on the 26th. As the prices of cotton and cloth rose sharply, it affected all other commodities, and in fact all prices increased by five percent. Although the open market exchange rate for U.S. dollars was still 39,000 to one, the black market rate rose from 40,000 to one to 43,000 to one, an increase of 7.7 percent. According to United Press, the above situation occurred "because Wedemeyer's statement is gradually losing its prestige".

　　李济琛将军发表谈话
  　痛斥美蒋亡华罪恶
    【新华社陕北二十八日电】刻寓香港之李济琛将军痛斥魏德迈援蒋灭华，与蒋介石出卖民族，加深中国人民灾难之罪恶。据塔斯社南京二十六日电，李氏在华商报发表谈话称：“自魏德迈抵华后，中国人民曾密切注视美国是否将改变其对华政策。在过去两年内，美政府曾以大量武器与金钱供应中国独裁政府以助长内战，因此种下了中国人民深重灾难与死亡的种子。而美政府由此获得许多损害中国独立与自由的特权，美军在华累累暴行未尝稍加约束。美政府违反盟国协议，正在助长日本侵略势力的复兴，使中国生存遭受威胁。所有这些事实，不能不使中国人民认为美对华政策是与中国人民为敌，并企图殖民地化中国。中国人民曾希望美对华政策有一个基本改变。自魏德迈抵华后。除了所传美国已自中国（蒋）政府获得某些战略基地，国（蒋）军已在台湾受训，美国要求中国蒋政府通过恢复对日贸易决议等消息外，并没有任何象征表示美国政策的改变。我们必须指出，魏德迈的使命就是在找寻加害于中国人民的有效办法。中国独裁政府既然不顾人民的饥饿与死亡，而进行内战。以‘总动员’的办法来榨取人民最后一滴血，并丝毫不顾惜日益凋敝的民族工商业，而服从美国意见恢复对日贸易，那末它将以民族屈辱与奴隶的代价来继续延长其独裁统治是非常明白的了。中国人民酷爱民主和平，目前中国人民已经有足够的觉悟来了解自己的愿望。中国人民这一愿望如不加以考虑，则中国问题就不可能解决。如果美国不改变其目前政策，并继续支持独裁与内战的一方的话，那末中国人民将依照孙中山的学说奋斗到底。”
    【塔斯社莫斯科二十五日电】真理报国际问题观察家马利宁评论魏德迈之使华称：战时驻华美军总司令兼蒋介石的参谋长魏德迈将军又衔特别使命来华了。美总统驻华特使的选择一定限于高级军人，可以说这已经成为真正的标准了。据魏德迈的屡次声明：他的使命就是负责进行“调查事实”的谨慎任务的，在他返华府时，这些事实调查将做为拟制美对华政策的蓝本。如众所预料者，魏德迈将军掩饰了这个要点，就是他的来华并不是因为他不知道成为中国时局特点的一些事实，而相反地，是因为他知道得太清楚了。魏德迈的来华并不是调查情况，而是来改变它。密勒氏评论周刊写道：毫无疑问地，摆在魏德迈面前的实际困难。给中国政府以经济“援助”呢还是无掩饰的军事援助。问题在于给中国的“援助”是否应效仿希腊形式（杜鲁门主义）或效法西欧形式（马歇尔计划）。然而，“密勒氏评论”把杜鲁门主义与马歇尔计划对称来看是把事实弄歪曲了。魏德迈使命表现出一个最明显的证据，证明这种对称看法毫无根据。如所周知，最近国民党以美国无数的军事经济援助而对民主军队发动的攻势已可耻的失败了。国民党领袖们并不满足于此，正在准备新攻势，并将其最后希望寄托在美国更大量的军事与经济援助上。最近某中国报纸称：魏德迈使团的主要任务是为完全改组国民党军队而争取时间，以便一俟其改组与训练完成，即向民主军队发动势不可当的攻势。因此，魏德迈将军在华特别使命的真正目的就远非简单的“事实调查”了。
    【新华社陕北二十八日电】各方消息证明，魏德迈离华声明之主要目的，仅在于鞭使蒋家小朝廷按照美国愿望迅速改善和加强其内战机构，并企图寻出某种办法为蒋介石争得此种“改善”和“加强”所需之时间。二十五日美国帝国主义的纽约时报在评论魏德迈声明之社论中，明白披露魏德迈要求蒋政权改革之目的即在于使国民党有力量“以武力结束内战。”该报将魏德迈声明称作“对于蒋介石的国民政府之和的哀的美顿书”和“忠告”，说“若不恢复此种国民（指蒋家小朝廷）之希望与信心，则无希望以武力结束内战”；说“蒋之布置橱窗工作，魏氏认为并不足够”。国民党最无耻之副主席孙科二十六日在广州发表对于魏德迈声明之“观感”时，亦称：魏德迈要国民党“肃清贪污”，足用以“争取民众”，“战胜共产党”。另息，在魏德迈声明发表后，蒋家小朝廷正忙作一团，摆出“肃清贪污”的样子，企图借此表现其执行主子命令之积极性。蒋政府于二十五日，即魏德迈声明之次日，赶忙下令厉行“惩治贪污条例”。蒋记行政院亦重新“革除懦弱无能及腐败的官员”之“决心”。蒋记监察院则宣称“将加强监察和强劾”，同时蒋记财政部派出“调查贪污”之官员已抵上海，说在上海已发现该地税务局向若干家具商勒索“法币”一万万多元的贪污事实。众信将有“拍苍蝇”的滑稽剧不断演出，而最大贪污犯蒋、宋、孔、陈四大家族，政学系集团，以及他们的亲信们，则将以此向其美国爸爸报功邀赏，并继续无止境的贪污下去。
    【新华社陕北二十八日电】据合众社及美联社上海二十六日电，在魏德迈离华后不出二十四小时，上海市场又顿形混乱。股票市场与商品市场价格于二十六日均陡然上涨。由于棉花与纱布的价格直趋上升，影响了其他一切商品，实际上一切价格都增加了百分之五。美钞汇率公开市场虽仍为三万九千比一，但黑市却自四万比一涨至四万三千比一，上升百分之七点七。据合众社称：上述情形之产生“系由魏德迈的声明的声价已逐渐低落缘故”。
