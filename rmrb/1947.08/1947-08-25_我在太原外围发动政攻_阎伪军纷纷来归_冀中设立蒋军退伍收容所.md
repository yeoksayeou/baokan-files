　　Xinhua News Agency, Jin Sui, 23rd--Under the military strikes and political persuasion of the People's Liberation Army, soldiers of the Yan-Fu armies deserted in droves. In the past two months, more than 500 people have been received in various liberated areas. The military and civilians of Yangqu County alone launched a political offensive against the periphery of the isolated island of Taiyuan. In the past six months, a total of 703 Yan's puppet military and political personnel have been won over, including 229 regular army soldiers and 474 members of the "Self-Defense Force" and "Village Governance" personnel. As a result, the "Administrative Bureau" established by Yan Xishan at Gujiao and Hekou towns in northwestern Taiyuan last winter, which took two months, and its six township offices, thirty-five village governance offices, and twelve self-defense forces have all been disintegrated. The New Second Brigade of Fu Zuoyi's army in Zuoyun County once replenished 500 new recruits last year, but now only 50 remain. The 35 new recruits of the 2nd company of the 2nd regiment of the brigade have deserted, leaving only one soldier. Most of these deserters brought weapons with them. Among the Yan army soldiers received in Fenyang, there were even light cannons. According to the Yan-Fu army soldiers who were received, life within the Yan-Fu army was very hard. For example, the 9th company of the 1st regiment of the 37th division of the Yan army stationed in Lancun, an important industrial center northwest of Taiyuan, had only more than 60 people. Due to malnutrition, more than 20 people fell ill, and they were not given medical treatment when they were ill. Four of them died, and three of them were stripped naked and buried, which was shocking to the survivors, who dared not stay any longer. Therefore, despite the strict control, more and more people took the opportunity to escape every day.
　　Xinhua News Agency, Jin-Cha-Ji, 23rd--The number of Kuomintang soldiers deserting along the Ping-Han Railway is increasing day by day. The Rongding (newly established county between Rongcheng and Dingxing east of the road) county government in central Hebei has specially established a "Kuomintang Army Veteran Reception Center" to receive them. A large sign is hung on the door, and the government's announcement of receiving (retired Kuomintang soldiers) is posted all over the villages in the Kuomintang-occupied areas. Large slogans are also written along the railway line. In the past eight days of last month alone, more than 120 people escaped to the reception center. According to those who escaped, the situation of the reception center is widely spread among the Kuomintang soldiers. Although more than 20 deserters were caught and shot by the Kuomintang army last month, the soldiers all realized that "if you don't run, you'll only be cannon fodder," and they continued to desert in large numbers. In the past five days, more than 20 people have been received again. Also, recently, many Kuomintang Fu Zuoyi soldiers who harassed Wangdu and Tangxian counties escaped to the liberated areas during marches or battles. The political department of the 3rd sub-district of Ji-Jin alone received as many as 49 people in the last four days of last month.
　　Xinhua News Agency, Jin-Cha-Ji, 23rd--Fu Zuoyi's troops along the Ping-Sui Railway are increasingly panicked. Nearly 20,000 civilians have been forcibly conscripted in Zhangjiakou and Xuanhua to build bunkers and fortifications, and tens of thousands of mu of nearby crops have been destroyed. Moreover, Fu's army's plan to conscript 120,000 soldiers in Chahar Province has begun to be implemented. People are being arrested indiscriminately in eastern and southern Chahar, and conscription offices have been set up in Zhangyuan. Young people in the border areas are escaping to the liberated areas in large numbers.

　　我在太原外围发动政攻
  　阎伪军纷纷来归
    冀中设立蒋军退伍收容所
    【新华社晋绥二十三日电】在解放军军事打击和政治争取下，阎傅军士兵纷纷逃亡。两个月来为解放区各地收容者，即达五百余人以上。仅阳曲一个县军民，向太原孤岛外围发动政治攻势，六个月来共争取阎伪军政人员七百○三名，内计正规军士兵二百二十九名，“自卫队”及“治村”人员四百七十四名，结果使得阎锡山于去冬费时两月，在太原西北古交及河口两镇所建立的“行政管理局”，及其所属六个乡公所三十五个治村公所和十二个自卫队已全部瓦解。左云傅军之新二旅去年曾补充新兵五百人，现只剩五十人。而该旅二团二连三十五名新兵，则逃得只剩下一名，这些逃亡士兵大部携来武器。汾阳收容之阎军中且有轻炮，据收容的阎傅军士兵说，阎傅军内部生活很苦，如驻太原西北的重要工业中心兰村之阎军三十七师第一团第九连仅六十余人，因营养不良，而病倒的就有二十余人，病了又不给医治，已有四人致死，其中三人并被剥光后赤条条掩埋，生者触目惊心，均不敢再呆下去。故管制虽严，乘机逃跑者仍日众。
    【新华社晋察冀廿三日电】平汉沿线蒋军逃亡日众，冀中容定（路东容城定兴间之新设县）县政府特设立“蒋军退伍收容所”予以收容，门上挂着大牌，政府收容（退伍蒋军）之布告，遍贴蒋占区各村，铁路沿线亦书有大字标语，仅上月八天中逃来收容所者即达百二十余名。据逃来者称：收容所的情形在蒋军士兵中普遍传播着。上月逃跑者虽经蒋军抓回二十余，悉数枪毙。但士兵均认识“不跑只有当炮灰”，仍继续大批逃亡，最近五天经收容者又达二十余名。又讯：日前窜扰望都、唐县之蒋傅军士兵，多乘行军或作战时向解放区逃跑，仅冀晋三分区政治部在上月底四天中，即曾收容四十九名之多。
    【新华社晋察冀二十三日电】平绥沿线傅作义部恐慌日甚，近在张家口、宣化两地强征民夫二万，赶筑碉堡工事，附近田禾被毁者已达万亩。又傅军在察省征兵十二万的计划已开始实施，在察东、察南各地乱抓，张垣并设有征兵事务所。边沿各地青壮年正大批向解放区逃避。
