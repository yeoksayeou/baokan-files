　　Choosing a Partner Also Depends on Class
　　·Zhou Fang·
　　This article was originally a special contribution to the "New Masses" monthly magazine and was already scheduled for the 42nd issue. Because it offers some enlightenment on class ideology education and answers some marriage questions that readers have raised to us in the past, which we have not been able to answer well, we have specially obtained the consent of the editors of the magazine to reprint it in advance so that the broad masses of readers can read it sooner.
　　　                                 　　——Editor

　　In the old society, it was difficult for poor people to find a wife. Now that we have been liberated, single men are all eager to find a partner. This is, of course, very right, but one thing should be noted: you also have to consider class.
　　Oh! Everything talks about class. Finding a partner is nothing more than for passing the time and having a thriving production. As long as both man and woman are willing, that's all that matters. What does this have to do with class? If you think this way, you are wrong! Don't think that finding a partner is a small matter. If you don't pay attention to class, you will suffer a great loss. Marrying a woman with a bad class background will bring big trouble!
　　First, be careful of landlords playing tricks! You have to think, in the old society, which landlord's woman would willingly marry a poor man? If a poor man took a fancy to the landlord's daughter, she would scold you: "A toad wants to eat swan meat." Does she suddenly fancy us poor people now? Be careful for a moment, afraid that she wants to use you to escape the struggle! Or she still has some baggage, hidden inside, wanting to find you as a bomb shelter! Or she wants to use special agent tactics to divide the unity of our peasants! It is better to be careful; caution is never amiss.
　　Second, be careful of separating from the masses! We poor people are fighting together. Now some have become cadres, some have become militiamen, and at least they are members of the peasants' association. We share blessings and bear hardships together. If you casually get together with a landlord's woman, everyone will call you to meetings; the old woman will call you to stay at home! Everyone will call you to struggle; the old woman will tell you not to offend people! If you want to discuss something, you dare not talk about it in your home, for fear that your old woman will leak the information! After attending a meeting and returning home, you are afraid that people will say that you are colluding! You dare not say a word of happiness to your wife, and the two of you cannot get along! The masses are also unhappy! Don't you think it's a disappointment! People should never be separated from the masses. Everyone recognizes her as an object of struggle, but you pull her into your arms as your wife. How can you not be separated from the masses! Wang Tianlai, the local tyrant landlord of Dongxiaotun in Handan, had his daughter hire a farmhand for half a month and immediately turned this farmhand from an activist into a backward element. Are you afraid or not?
　　Third, be careful that the landlord's woman's ideology does not transform well. Let me give you an example: Gong Qiaoying, the wife of Liu Chungui, a special agent landlord in Yucheng Guan, had her husband beaten to death by the masses for heinous crimes. After being introduced by villagers, she married the farmer Liu Erze as his wife. After marrying, she did not sleep at night, and even when she did sleep, she did not take off her pants. She did not get along with Lao Liu and often fought, while the farmer Liu Erze treated her very well. After several struggles and education by the Women's Federation, the woman only superficially admitted her mistakes but did not actually change. This caused Liu Erze, a liberated peasant, to be frowning all day long, having found himself a disappointment! The masses reflected that it would be better to simply divorce and find another partner, to be more cheerful.
　　Why did it turn out this way! It is because this woman's ideology has not changed. She is still thinking about her dead special agent husband. She still looks down on Liu Erze, this peasant! Originally, you should know that the ideology of the landlords is difficult to change. It is easier to change rivers and mountains than a person's nature! Rivers and mountains are the land, property, and political rule that the landlords have occupied. The peasants want to liquidate them and defeat them! This has been done. Human nature is the landlord's exploitative ideology and hostile ideology of looking down on peasants. It is not easy for the peasants to transform this ideology. If the two of you get together, one says east and the other says west, one says the peasants are impoverished by the landlords' exploitation, and the other says it is your own fate to be poor. How can you live at that time?
　　Even if you have the ability to change her ideology, and even if she is willing to change her ideology and sincerely bow her head to the peasants, you still have to guard against one thing:
　　Fourth, be careful that the landlord's woman has no labor habits and does not know how to live frugally. I can give you an example. It is also from Yucheng Guan. It is the wife of the landlord Chang Yan. Chang Yan ran away during the struggle. His woman immediately married a veteran. This woman had a good life in the landlord's house and suffered no hardship. After marrying our veteran, life is still good, and she does not suffer any hardship. She simply does not know how to engage in production. Therefore, this veteran cannot better make a family fortune, and he has found a living treasure who only knows how to consume. You see, if our peasants want to start a family and establish a career, they must be able to help each other, and everyone must work hard in production. What is the point of that?
　　So! Peasants dare not find landlords' women as partners. But aren't these landlords' women, whether they are daughters or widows, only destined to live as widows for the rest of their lives, with no one to marry? That is not the case. It is best to let her be reformed for a period of time, suffer some hardship, and labor, understand the past pain of the peasants, and know that it is wrong and sinful to eat without working in the past and live by exploiting the peasants! After transforming her ideology, sincerely surrendering to the peasants, and developing some labor habits, knowing how to live frugally! And after investigation, she is not a special agent and has no ulterior motives, then she can be said to have changed her class status somewhat. At that time, if she wants to marry our peasant, our peasant can also consider it. (The End)

### 找对象也要看阶级

　　找对象也要看阶级
    ·周方·
    这篇文章原来是“新大众”月刊的特约稿，已经排进该刊第四十二期里面了。因为对阶级思想教育很有些启发，也答复了过去读者向我们提出而我们未能好好解答的一些婚姻问题，所以特别征取得该刊编者的同意，提前转载出来，让广大的读者得以早点儿读到。　　　　　　　
　　　                                 　　——编者    　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　
    在旧社会里，穷人找个老婆是很难的。现在翻身了，光身汉都急巴巴的想找个对象。这当然是很应该的，但有一点应该注意，就是：也要看阶级。
    唉呀！啥事也讲阶级，找对象无非为的过时光，好红火闹生产，只要男情女愿就算了，这也有啥阶级不阶级呢？若是这样想，你就错了！莫看搞对象是个小事，要不讲究点阶级，就要吃大亏，娶了成分不好的女人，麻烦大哩！
    第一，要当心地主捣鬼！你要想想，在旧社会里，有那个地主女人愿随便嫁给穷人的呢？要有穷人看上了地主闺女，她还要骂你：“癞蛤蟆想吃天鹅肉。”难道现在她就忽然相中了咱穷人么？当心一下子，怕他是要利用你逃避斗争哩！或是他还有些包袱、内藏，想找你当防空洞哩！或是要上特务手段，要分化咱农民的团结咧！防人之心不可无，还是当心点好。
    第二，要当心脱离群众！咱穷人一伙子闹斗争，现在有的当上干部了，有的当上民兵了，起码也是个农会员。咱是有福同享，有难同挡；你要是随便搞上个地主女人，大家叫你开会哩；老婆子叫你在家里哩！大家叫你斗争哩；老婆子叫你别得罪人哩！要商量点啥事，不敢在你家里谈，怕你老婆子走了风声！自己开个会回家来，怕人家说你走里哩！一肚子高兴不敢对老婆吭，两口子扯不在一搭！群众还不高兴哩！你看败兴不败兴！人总不要脱离了群众，大家认他是斗争对象，你倒扯进怀里当老婆，该不脱离群众哩！邯郸东小屯恶霸地主王天来，让自己的闺女，给他雇工搞上半个多月，一下就把这雇工从积极分子拉成落后分子了。你看怕不怕？
    第三，要当心地主女人思想转变不好，这我举个例子你听听：榆社城关有个特务地主刘春贵的女人贡巧英，丈夫因罪大恶极，被群众打死了，经过村人介绍，嫁给农民刘二则为妻，自嫁过后，黑夜不睡觉，就睡也不脱裤子，不和老刘好，时常打架，而农民刘二则对待他很好，经过妇救会几次的斗争、教育，女的只表面承认错误，实际上不改。弄得刘二则这个翻身农民，一天到晚愁眉不展，自己找上个败兴！群众反映说：倒不如干脆离婚另找上个对象，痛快些。
    为啥弄的个这哩！就为的这女人思想没有转变，她还在想着她死去的那个特务丈夫哩，她还瞧不起刘二则这个农民哩！本来你该知道，地主们的思想就是不好转变，江山易改，本性难移！江山就是地主霸住了的土地财产和他的政治统治，农民要清算回来，打垮他！是办到了的；本性是地主的剥削思想，瞧不起农民的敌对思想，农民要去改造他这个思想，是不容易的，两口子弄在一圪塔，一个说东，一个说西，一个说农民被地主剥削穷了，一个说活该你自己命穷，你看这时光怎么过呢？
    就算你有本事改变她的思想，又就算她愿意改变思想，真心向农民低头，你还得防着一手，那就是：
    第四，要当心地主女人没劳动习惯，不会过时光，这也有个例子可举，也是榆社城关的。是地主常砚的老婆，常砚在斗争中逃跑了，他女人马上嫁给一个荣誉军人。这个女人前在地主家，生活很好，没受一点罪，嫁给咱荣退军人，生活还是好，不受一点罪，根本就不会闹生产，所以这个荣誉军人也不能更好的发家，算是找了个光会消耗的活宝，你看咱农民成家立业，要不能男帮女衬，大家努力生产，那算的个啥哩！
    如此说来！农民就是不敢找地主的女人作对象了。但这些地主的女人们，无管是闺女、寡妇，岂不只有活守一辈子寡，没人可嫁了么？那倒不然，最好让她先改造一个时候，也受受罪，劳动劳动，明白了农民过去的痛苦，知道自己过去光吃不干活，靠剥削农民过日子，是不对的，是有罪的！改造好了思想，真心向农民投诚；又养成了些劳动习惯，会过时光！又经过考察，不是特务，心里没怀着鬼胎，这就可以称得上改变了些成份了。那时她要想嫁咱农民，咱农民也可以考虑考虑了。（完）
