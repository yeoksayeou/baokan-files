Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 2nd: Moscow dispatch: The Albanian government delegation led by Hoxha, Chairman of the Council of Ministers and Minister of Foreign Affairs of Albania, and the Soviet government have concluded an economic agreement as a result of their talks. A joint communiqué issued by both sides on the 27th stated: "In the spirit of friendly cooperation, the two countries discussed issues related to their economic and cultural relations. The Soviet government, in view of the enormous damage and losses suffered by Albania under the German and Italian aggressors, and its request for economic assistance, has decided to grant Albania a credit loan and will therefore supply Albania with light industrial equipment and agricultural machinery. The two sides also fully exchanged views on issues of interest to both countries." Hoxha and his party left the Soviet Union for Albania on the 26th. At the Moscow airport, Hoxha gave a speech expressing his heartfelt gratitude for the assistance from the Soviet Union.

Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 2nd: Helsinki dispatch: The Soviets have agreed to increase the supply of grain to Finland by 40,000 tons, in addition to what is stipulated in the Soviet-Finnish trade agreement, to be delivered before September. According to Finnish newspapers, Finland had originally ordered 80,000 tons of grain from Argentina, but due to the high price, it could only purchase 35,000 tons, of which only one batch has arrived so far. Therefore, this Soviet aid is of great significance to Finland.

Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 2nd: Warsaw dispatch: (Delayed) Poland and Switzerland signed an agreement on July 10 to expand their economic relations. Poland will increase coal exports in exchange for Swiss machinery and chemical products.

    【新华社陕北二日电】赫尔辛基讯：苏联人同意除苏、芬商约规定者外，另外增加粮食四万吨供给芬兰，定于九月以前交到。据芬兰报纸称：芬原曾向阿根廷订购谷物八万吨，但以价格过高，只能购买三万五千吨，但迄今仅运到一批，因此苏联此项援助对芬兰实具有重大意义。
