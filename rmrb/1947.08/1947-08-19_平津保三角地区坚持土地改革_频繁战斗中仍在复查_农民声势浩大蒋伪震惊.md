Xinhua News Agency, Jin-Cha-Ji, 17th: Although the Pingjinbao (Beijing-Tianjin-Baoding) triangle area is experiencing frequent battles, it is still persisting in land reform and re-examination movements. The immense momentum of the province's middle and poor peasants’ unity has shocked Chiang Kai-shek and his puppet regime. At the end of last month, 5,000 peasants from 53 villages in the Gu'an-Zhuolu joint county, more than 100 li south of Beiping, held a liberation meeting somewhere along the Yongding River. Peasants, holding bright red banners that said "Take Back the Land," spoke out about their suffering and demanded compensation for blood debts from landlords and local bullies. Peasants in dozens of villages, including Erli and Geda, 60 li west of Tianjin, persisted in their struggle despite the constant "mopping-up" and "encirclement and suppression" by Chiang's troops in the important strongholds of Shengfang Wangqingtuo and Donggugang. The feudal forces in Geda Village were strong, but the peasants persisted in their struggle and finally won. The big feudal landlord Chen Yuankuan in the village has been thoroughly liquidated. In Tang Erli Village, the KMT secret agent and local tyrant were defeated. The Peasant Representative Assembly, the highest organ of peasant rights, has been formally established. More than a thousand peasants in the village held a parade and demonstration, carrying high the six characters "Peasant Representative Assembly" decorated with colorful silk and flowers, and shouting "Unite and launch a major offensive against feudal forces!" and "Speak out if you have grievances, seek revenge if you have hatred!" The Chiang Kai-shek troops in Wangqingtuo, who were attempting to harass the area, were frightened and fled upon hearing this. In the newly liberated areas of Anxin County, east of Baoding, such as Lamatidi and 20 other villages, the peasant liberation movement is also developing enthusiastically. Peasants near the "City Ditch" (city defense works) of Baoding held guns in one hand and distributed land with the other, implementing distribution as soon as they seized it. After receiving the land, the peasants enthusiastically paid public grain. One large village alone reached 100,000 jin in less than three days and sent it to the county warehouse.
