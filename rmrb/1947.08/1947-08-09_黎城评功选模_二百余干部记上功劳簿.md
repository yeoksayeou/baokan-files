	Licheng Commends Merit and Selects Models
	Over Two Hundred Cadres Recorded on the Roll of Honor
	[This newspaper's Licheng dispatch] At the enlarged cadre meeting of Licheng County on July 20th, the County Merit Evaluation Committee, based on the work of the first half of the year, carried out merit comparison and evaluation, converting three minor merits into one major merit, and democratic voting to elect models. A total of two hundred and ten county and district cadres were credited with merit. For example, Comrade Shen Baohe, the fifth district head, under the severe attack of the drought, organized cadres to go deep into poor and hired peasant households in Henan Village, mobilized the masses to speak out about the suffering caused by the drought, inspired the masses to actively fight the drought and protect the seedlings, and organized the masses of Henan, Yuanzhuang, and Wushimu villages to build a water channel with 200 workdays, which could irrigate 51 mu of land. He personally went to the homes of newly emancipated households to check their property one by one, helped them calculate their assets, and used Han Liuhai's production and thrift plan to get through the famine as an example, and formulated a village-wide plan, so that the whole village launched a production and thrift movement to get through the famine. Comrade Fan Renqing, the first district head, felt that the masses in Xiwu and other villages were very troubled by the constant reception of people passing by on the main road during the spring plowing season, so he discussed with the masses and organized a "Resist-Conscription Store" to save manpower. When sowing began, village cadres and the masses reflected that there were too many meetings, which delayed production. He then worked with cadres and the masses to study and lead by lane and street, with cadres working specifically in one team and one street, reporting and summarizing on time, and helping labor hero Sun Aiting's group create a triple combination of sideline production and war service, unified work points, and unified profit sharing, which solved the contradictions in the village's work. These meritorious officials and their achievements were praised in the evaluation. After the meeting, everyone unanimously proposed to make great contributions in future thrift and increased production. (Wang Changqun)
