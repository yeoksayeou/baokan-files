　　Zhou Yonghua Brigade
  　Plans Autumn Harvest
    [Our newspaper's Jinnan dispatch from the 21st] The Zhou Yonghua Brigade of Xiangchenggu, Qiu County, discussed their autumn harvest plan. Everyone said, "There are three busy periods at this time: first, the busy autumn harvest; second, the busy wheat planting; and third, the busy period for sideline occupations when they are most profitable!" Therefore, it was decided that 14 people would specialize in agricultural production, 11 people would specialize in sideline production, and 2 people would specialize in milling flour and feeding livestock. In terms of agriculture, there are a total of 368.8 mu of autumn crops. To harvest the crops and bring the firewood home will require 127 head of cattle labor and 1,041 human labor. The 14 people can complete this in 24 days and two half-days. In addition to engaging in sideline production, the other 11 people can also use their spare time to turn over wheat fields, accumulate fertilizer, and produce fertilizer.
