"If people don't fight the wolves, the wolves will bite people."
The Masses of Yinji fiercely struggle against the landlords.
[Report from our Jinnan correspondent on the 3rd] When the situation in Yinji, Gaotang was just opening up, the masses feared the return of the "Miscellaneous Regiment" (雜團, a reference to bandits or poorly disciplined local troops), and didn't believe we could lead them to liberation, and even more looked down on their own strength. They only saw that the Hao family landlord had fled, and dozens of tenant households didn't dare to cultivate the landlord's land, and then said: there is no land to cultivate. They felt it was better when the Hao family landlord was around because they could at least scrape by, thinking that this was just their fate. An old tenant woman needed bricks to build a platform for her door, so she went everywhere to pick up broken bricks. But next to her door, in front of the fleeing landlord's house, there were piles of bricks, but she dared not touch them. Someone asked her, and she said: "The God of Wealth is here, who dares to touch them?" The leadership, seizing the moment when tenants and poor peasants were suffering from hunger and lack of fuel, first confiscated firewood, and the next day immediately launched a campaign to seize hidden wealth. In the past, the landlord Yin Xukang, forcibly demanded that tenant households repay loans of cotton. If they couldn't repay, he would tear down their houses. When the tenants brought this up, their class hatred greatly increased, and they struggled against the Yin family's one hundred and twenty rooms. However, the masses were somewhat satisfied with the landlord's superficial surrender, and they were not yet completely confident when taking things from the landlord's house. They said that the landlord was already poor, and their fighting spirit was diminished. Because the struggle was not fierce enough, the landlord's arrogance rose, he made strange remarks on the street, and carried hand grenades at night, thinking the struggle was over and secretly rejoicing. Yin Congben said to his relatives: "I have plenty of things." The village cadre actively investigated the landlord's hidden wealth, and found that the Hao family landlord had three secret rooms storing things. The director of the peasant association took out the landlord's hand grenade at the mass meeting and said: "Who is this prepared for?" Pointing out the things that had been seized, he said: "These things are worth the entire wealth of how many of our families? Even if they pluck a hair, it's thicker than our thighs. Who says the landlord is poor?" The masses shouted: "If we don't struggle against the landlords, the landlords will still take revenge! If people don't fight the wolves, the wolves will bite people. The landlords have plenty of things, we must fight them thoroughly!"

    “人不打狼，狼要咬人”
    尹集群众猛斗地主
    【本报冀南三日电】高唐尹集刚打开局面时，群众怕杂团再过来，不相信我们能领导他们翻身，更看不起自己力量。他们只看见郝家地主逃亡了，几十家佃户不敢种地主的地，就说：没地种了。觉得还不如郝家地主在时能够混饭吃，认为反正是命该如此。一个佃户老太太，门要垒台，没有砖，就到处去拣碎砖头；但与她门挨着的逃亡地主门前堆着大批砖，她不敢动。有人问她，她说：“人家财神爷在这里，谁敢动？”领导上抓紧佃户、贫农正在少吃无烧的时候，首先没收柴火，第二天即搞浮财。过去地主尹序康，强逼佃户还借贷的棉花，还不起，就扒房，佃户提起来，阶级仇恨大增，斗了尹家一百二十间房子。但群众对地主的表面屈服有些满足，拿地主家东西时还不理直气壮。说地主已经穷了，斗争劲头小了。因斗的不狠，地主气焰就高了，在街上说怪话，晚上带手榴弹活动，以为斗争已过，暗自欢喜。尹从本对其亲人说：“我东西多着哩。”村干就积极调查地主内财，查出郝家地主有三个暗屋存着东西。农会主任在群众大会上拿出地主的手榴弹说：“这是给谁预备的？”指出搞出来的东西说：“这些东西得顶咱们多少家的家业，人家拔根汗毛也比咱们的大腿粗，谁说地主穷了呢？”群众高喊：“咱不斗地主，地主还要报仇哩，人不打狼，狼要咬人。地主的东西多的哩，非斗彻底不行！”
