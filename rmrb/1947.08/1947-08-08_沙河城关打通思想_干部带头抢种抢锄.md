    Shahe Chengguan Breaks Through Ideology
    Cadres Take the Lead in Rushing to Plant and Weed
    [This Newspaper’s Report] After the rain on the 26th of last month, Shahe Chengguan Village convened a meeting of group leaders and above to plan for emergency planting. It was discovered on the spot that everyone had two thoughts: First, most people wanted to leave the land fallow to plant wheat. Second, some had enough grain from their few mu of paddy fields and didn't want to plant dry land. The leadership then raised the question: in recent years, which year hasn't been dry in the first half and had favorable rain in the second half? Like this year, will planting wheat guarantee a harvest? Let everyone discuss. Public Security Officer Huang Bangyan said: "Distant water cannot quench immediate thirst, I have to plant all my land." He also calculated that Beiguan has a total of 240 mu of paddy fields, each mu can yield an average of 1.2 shi, for a total of 288 shi; Beiguan has a total of 304 people, each person eats an average of 2.5 dou per month, requiring a total of 76 shi of grain. The grain from the paddy fields is only enough for four months. After this calculation, everyone agreed that not planting dry land was not an option. Then they discussed how to rush the planting. In Beijie, 900 mu of dry land had not been plowed, and there were only 61 livestock. Some suggested that it was impossible anyway, as there was too much land and not enough livestock. Everyone then made a specific calculation: 61 livestock could be formed into 20 teams, each team plowing 5 mu per day, totaling 150 mu per day, which could be plowed in six days, in time for planting. The specific method was to select 30 skilled plowmen such as Zhang Shixiu, Han Chenfu, and Zhai Xiao to specialize in plowing, with the remaining labor force weeding and watering. For example, Han Dalai's group had four livestock, forming two teams; two skilled plowmen like Han Chenfu would plow and sow, the remaining six laborers would have four weeding and two watering, and two women would plant beans at the site. The 900 mu of land in Beijie will be planted with small mung beans, buckwheat, red and white radishes, and vegetables, with the slogan "Not a single mu of land will be left idle." After the meeting, the cadres returned to the masses to deliberate, and the next day, led by the cadres, they all started rushing to plant in full swing. (Shahe Organize Small Newspaper)
    [This Newspaper’s Report] Wu'an Shangbailin’s work was considered top-notch in the Seventh District, but upon deeper investigation, it was found that mutual aid was still organized according to the "lu" system (ancient village administrative unit), so everyone's enthusiasm for mutual production was not high. Later, under voluntary association, it was reorganized, resulting in 17 groups, with 106 full laborers, 32 semi-laborers, totaling 138, accounting for 80% of the village's 172 laborers, leaving only 34 who did not participate. After the reorganization, they immediately organized planting, completing the planting of the entire village's 2,918 mu of land in two and a half days. During planting, most of the seeds were treated with two-thirds warm water soaking. There are two methods for accounting during planting: (1) Calculated by land area: 120 yuan for sowing one mu, 88 yuan for rolling one mu, and 40 yuan for leveling one mu. (2) Calculated by labor: Mules are priced at 20 points, donkeys at 15 points, full laborers at 10 points, semi-laborers at 5 points, with variations of 6, 7, and 8 points, depending on the work. They are now conducting a planting summary, selecting planting models, and launching a weeding campaign. (Wu'an People's Small Newspaper)

    沙河城关打通思想
    干部带头抢种抢锄
    【本报讯】上月二十六下雨后，沙河城关村召集组长以上干部会议，计划抢种，当场发现大家有两个思想：一、大部分要留白地种麦子。二、有几亩水地打的粮食够吃了，就不想种旱地。领导上就提出这几年那年不是前半年旱后半年雨水调顺，像今年这样种上麦能收不能？让大家讨论，公安员黄邦眼说：“远水解不得近渴，我得要把地都种上。”又算了算北关共水地二百四十亩，每亩平均能收一石二，共能收二百八十八石；全北关共三百零四口人，平均每人一月吃二斗半，共需粮食七十六石，水地打的粮食只够四个月吃，这样一算，大家都通过了，认为不种旱地不行。接着讨论如何抢种，北街有旱地九百亩没犁，只有牲口六十一头，有的提出反正不行，地多牲口少种不上，大家又具体算了一下，六十一头牲口配成二十犋，每犋一天犁五亩，一天共犁一百五十亩，六天就可犁完，能赶上种。具体办法是选出张士修、韩辰伏、翟孝等三十名犁地能手，专门犁地，其余劳力，锄地的锄地，浇地的浇地，如韩大来组四个牲口成两犋，韩辰伏等二个犁地能手犁地耩地，余六个劳力，四个锄地，两个浇地，二个妇女在地点豆。北街九百亩地要都种上小绿豆荞麦红白萝卜小菜等，口号是不留一亩地。会后干部回到群众中酝酿，第二天在干部带领下都轰轰烈烈的抢种起来。（沙河组织起来小报）
    【本报讯】武安上柏林工作在七区算是上等村，但工作一深入，检查出互助仍是按闾编的，所以大家生产互助劲头不算大，后来又在自愿结合下，重新组织，经过整顿，又组织起十七个组，正劳力一百零六个，半劳力三十二个，共一百三十八个，占全村劳力一百七十二个的百分之八十，只剩下三十四个没参加。重新整顿后，即组织下种，在两天半内即完成全村二千九百一十八亩地的下种，在下种时，大部作到三分之二的温汤浸种。对下种算帐办法有两个：（一）按地亩算，耩一亩地一百二十元，砘一亩地八十八元，一亩地四十元。（二）按劳力算，骡定价二十分，驴定价十五分，整劳力十分，半劳力五分，六分、七分、八分不等，按活定分。现在他们正在进行下种总结，选拔下种模范，开展锄苗运动。（武安人民小报）
