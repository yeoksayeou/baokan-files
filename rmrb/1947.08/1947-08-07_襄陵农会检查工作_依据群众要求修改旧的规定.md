    Xiangling Farmers' Association Inspects Work
    Revises Old Regulations Based on Mass Demands
    [This Newspaper] The Xiangling County Farmers' Association recently convened all its cadres to review land reform work. In their reports, each cadre said: After arriving in the village, they explained how they understood the situation, how they carried out the struggle, and then how they distributed the fruits of the struggle. Some said, "The demands of the masses are inconsistent with our leadership in many ways, and it took a lot of effort to get the masses to think correctly, and some simply couldn't be turned around, and the problem hasn't been solved." Everyone was saying the same thing, the meeting place was cold and cheerless, without any debate. At this point in the meeting, the leadership realized that everyone was talking about their own thoughts, and not expressing the voices of the masses, and proposed that everyone talk about the demands of the masses. As soon as this was said, the meeting place immediately became lively, and the debate was very intense. On the issue of hidden property, the masses said that if the hidden property was not dug out, the landlords could not be defeated and their status could not be completely overturned. Simply dividing up the land without money to buy livestock and furniture, are they supposed to dig with their hands? When Chai Village struggled against Han Qingtang, they uncovered some hidden property (silks, foreign cloth, gold and silver treasures, etc.), and the masses said, "If these things are not dug out, the old rich will still have 'air raid shelters,' and the poor will not be able to completely turn themselves around." After the struggle in Chai Village, the masses in Cui Village said, "Why can Chai Village dig, but we can't? If there is no market price, there is a comparison price. We are all the same common people, why should we be treated differently?" On the issue of dividing up the fruits of the struggle, some villages had problems with their methods of distributing the fruits. They used the average yield as the standard, and also added "depending on how active they are." As a result, cadres and activists got more of the fruits, while the truly land-poor farmers did not have their demands met. The masses said, "Some eat until they are stuffed to death, some starve to death, some suffer, some enjoy, and a few people have done good deeds." Some families that were better off got more things, and the masses said, "Those with full stomachs and those with empty stomachs cannot be divided the same way, fill the holes first, then divide evenly." Finally, the meeting broke through the policy circle, approved the masses' demand to dig out hidden property, and corrected the rich peasant line of dividing up the fruits, replacing it with a policy of filling in the gaps. Finally, the conference made clear an experience: that is, to listen to the opinions of the masses at all times, discover the demands of the masses, and revise our regulations accordingly, in order to truly follow the mass line. Only in this way can we thoroughly defeat feudal landlords.

    襄陵农会检查工作
    依据群众要求修改旧的规定
    【本报讯】襄陵县农会日前召集全体干部，检讨土改工作。各干部汇报时都说：到村以后，怎样了解的情况，怎样斗争的，然后又是怎样分了果实的。有的说：“群众要求有很多地方和咱们领导上不一致，费了很大的劲，才把群众的思想打通，有的根本就扭不过来，问题还没解决。”谁也是这一套，会场上冷冷清清，没有一点争论。会议开到这里，领导上发现大家都说的是自己的话，没有说出群众的话来，提出要大家把群众的要求谈谈。这样一来，会场马上热闹起来，争论非常激烈，在对内产问题上，群众说不刨掉内产，就打不垮地主，翻不透身，光分些土地没钱买牲口、家具，叫拿手挖么？柴村斗争韩清堂，搞了一部分内产（绸缎、洋布、金银财宝等），群众说：“这点东西不挖出来，老财还是有‘防空洞’，穷人还是不能彻底翻身”。柴村斗争以后崔家庄的群众说：“为啥柴村能刨，我们不能刨？没行市有比市，都是一样的老百姓，为啥两样看待。”在分果果实问题上，有些村子分配果实的方法有毛病，按平均产量为标准，另外还加上“看他积极不积极”，因此形成干部积极分子多得果实，真正缺地少地农民，没有满足其要求，群众说：“有的吃的能撑死，有的饿的能饿死，苦的苦，甜的甜，给几个人干了好事。”有些家庭较好的，分的东西多了一些，群众说：“饱肚子饿肚子不能一样分，填满了窟窿再平均。”最后会上踢破政策圈子，批准了群众挖内产要求，改正了分果实的富农路线，而代之以填平补齐的果实政策。最后大会明确了一条经验：即是要时时刻刻听取群众意见，发现群众要求，来修改我们的规定，才能真正的走了群众路线，只有这样才能斗透封建地主。
