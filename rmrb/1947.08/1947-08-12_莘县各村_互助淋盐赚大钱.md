From February to now, they have extracted 4,600 jin of saltpeter, over 50,000 jin of salt, and 200 barrels of brine, earning 3.2 million yuan. In addition to solving their livelihood, they also bought livestock and farm implements. The Zhang Kunlun group bought two cows, four carts, and 60 dou of grain. The entire village added 71 livestock, one large cart, nine small carts, and 15 various farm implements.
