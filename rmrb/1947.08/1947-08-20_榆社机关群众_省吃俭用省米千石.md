　　Yushe Government and Masses
  　Save Rice by Practicing Austerity: 1000 Stone Saved
    [Our Newspaper, Yushe] The production and thrift campaign is being carried out universally, from the leading organs of the county down to small villages in the mountains. For example, County Chief Shi Fu and Fourth District Chief Zhao Dingliang, who used to smoke at least one pack of cigarettes a day, have now quit, influencing others to quit smoking voluntarily. (Some comrades have switched to smoking local tobacco and hand in their subsidies for rice, lowering their standard of living. Each person saves five sheng of rice per month.) According to incomplete statistics, in July alone, county and district cadres saved 75,000 yuan on cigarettes, saved 780 jin of rice from subsidies (130 people), and saved 375 jin of rice from food (only 48 people in the county-level organs). The masses are consciously emphasizing eating less rice and cooking more vegetables, planting more vegetables, harvesting more grain, reclaiming wasteland to harvest even a sheng of grain, and saving one day's food to survive for three days. They are closely grasping the positive thinking through praise and encouragement, so that the standard of living is generally reduced, eating and drinking are gradually decreasing, and less flour is eaten during festivals; guests are also eating whatever is available. According to incomplete statistics, more than 1,500 stone of millet has been saved. (Joint Office)
    [Our Newspaper, Yuzhuang] Zhang Dingliang, a model cadre in Baicun, Second District, not only led the masses to discuss and formulate plans to practice thrift, but also took the lead in starting with himself. He held a family meeting with his family members, formulated a plan, accepted the experience of 1943, ate more bran and vegetables, and proposed that those who do not work in the fields should eat less dry food. For example, previously, one sheng of grain flour was cooked for "getada" (a type of pasta) in the morning, but now only those who work in the fields eat it, and those at home eat porridge, half a sheng is enough. Previously, one sheng of rice was used for rice with soup at noon, along with one sheng of flour, but now the flour has been removed. In this way, his family can save half a sheng of rice and one sheng of flour a day. From July 15th to now, in more than a month, they have saved one dou and a half of rice and three dou of flour, which is enough to eat for another month. If they add some bran and vegetables, it will be enough to eat for a month and a half. In addition to saving, his whole family is also actively engaged in production. For example, in the 100-day spinning and transportation campaign, his mother and women exceeded the task by more than six jin, earning enough to wear cotton clothes this winter. In the second 100-day spinning and transportation campaign, six bolts of cloth have now been woven, a total of twelve zhang and one chi, calculated at 150 yuan, amounting to 18,000 yuan, which can buy more than one stone of rice.

  　省吃俭用省米千石
    【本报榆社讯】在生产节约运动上，自县的领导机关下至山沟小庄普遍展开。如县长石夫，四区长赵顶良，素时每人至少一天吸一盒纸烟，现在禁绝不吸，影响别人自动禁了烟（个别同志改吸水旱烟，把津贴米交公，降低生活水平，每月每人节约米五升，据不完全的统计，只七月份县区干部省烟洋七万五千元，节约津贴米（一百三十人）七百八十斤，省吃米（只县层机关四十八人）三百七十五斤。群众均自觉强调少下一把米多煮一把菜，多种一亩菜，多顶一石粮，刨一个荒收一升粮，节约一天渡荒三天。抓紧表扬鼓励积极思想，使生活水平普遍降低，吃喝日渐减少，过节少吃面，客人也是碰着什吃什。据不完全统计，已节约小米一千五百余石。（联合办公室）
    【本报榆壮讯】二区白村模范干部张鼎亮，领导群众讨论订计划厉行节约外，他自己首先从本身做起，和家里人开了个家庭会议，订出了计划，接受了四三年经验，多吃糠菜，提出不上地的人少吃干的，如以前早晨是煮圪塔得一升谷面，改为光给上地的人吃，在家的吃稀的，半升就够了，晌午以前一升米捞饭，还赶一升面，现在把面去了。这样，他家一天就能节约半升米一升面，从七月十五号到现在，一月余就节约下斗半米三斗面，又能够一月吃，如果再加些糠菜就能够一月半吃。除节约外，他全家还积极生产，如百日纺运，他娘与女人除完成任务外又超过六斤多，获利足够今冬穿棉衣；第二次百日纺运现在已织成六个布，共十二丈一尺，按一百五十元计算，合洋一万八千元，又能买米一石多。（志明、文彦）
