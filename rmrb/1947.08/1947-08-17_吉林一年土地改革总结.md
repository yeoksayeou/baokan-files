Xinhua News Agency, Northeast, 14th. The Jilin Provincial Committee of the Communist Party of China summarized the province's mass movement experience of the past year in mid-July, focusing on reviewing the right-leaning thinking in the past land reform work. The meeting pointed out that although the Provincial Party Committee emphasized the policy of boldly mobilizing the mass movement in July last year, in guiding the actual movement, it unilaterally emphasized taking care of small and medium landlords, believing that the land of traitors, evil gentry, and big landlords and public land could be distributed to farmers through liquidation and confiscation, while small and medium landlords had to undergo rent and interest reduction. It also stipulated from top to bottom that landlords should be left with more land and that land should be divided peacefully, which actually hindered the implementation of the policy of boldness and resulted in the "half-baked" phenomenon in the land reform movement during this period. It was not until after the mass movement meeting in December that the land reform took a step further, enabling 1,070,000 farmers to obtain 520,000 hectares of land (10 mu per hectare), more than 27,800 houses, more than 21,000 shi of grain, and cattle, horses, and floating wealth, and seized 2,500 black guns from landlords, but 50 percent of the province still had a "half-baked" state. The meeting believed that the current fear of boldness is specifically manifested in: using the excuse of not infringing upon the interests of middle peasants and unilaterally emphasizing taking care of small and medium landlords, hindering the bold crackdown on feudal evil gentry and landlords. As a result, landlords were not overthrown, middle peasants were not won over, and farmers could not be mobilized. They do not understand the universality of the existence of feudal forces, and even believe that some areas have no landlords and rich peasants, only middle and poor peasants, and therefore say that the main task in those areas is production rather than land struggle. Some believe that because there are many small and medium landlords and much public land in eastern Jilin, the land is scattered, so the feudal forces are not strong. The meeting decided that the future work should be to thoroughly eliminate right-leaning thoughts and further implement the policy of boldness, so as to consolidate and expand the East Manchurian Liberated Area.

　　吉林一年土地改革总结
    【新华社东北十四日电】中共吉林省委上月中旬，总结该省一年群运经验，着重检讨过去土地改革工作中的右倾思想。会议指出去年七月，省委虽曾强调大胆放手发动群运的方针，但在指导实际运动时，对中小地主片面强调照顾，认为汉奸恶霸大地主的土地和公地可经清算没收方式分配给农民，而对中小地主则须经过减租减息。又自上而下的规定给地主多留地，和平分地等，实际上阻碍了大胆放手方针的实行，造成这一时期土地改革运动的“夹生”现象。直至十二月群运会议以后，土地改革深入了一步，使一百零七万农民取得土地五十二万垧（每垧十亩），房屋二万七千八百余间，粮食二万一千多石及牛马浮财等，并搜出地主黑枪二千五百枝，但全省仍有百分之五十的地区还存着“夹生”状态。会议认为目前不敢大胆放手的思想是具体表现为：借口不侵犯中农利益，及片面强调对中小地主照顾，阻碍了放手打击封建恶霸地主，结果地主未打倒，中农未争取到，农民也发动不起来。不了解封建势力存在的普遍性，甚至相信一部分地区没有地主富农，只有中贫农，因而说那些地区主要的任务是生产而不是土地斗争，有的则因吉东中小地主多，公地多，而认为土地是分散的，因此封建势力不强。会议当决定今后工作为彻底肃清右倾思想，进一步贯澈大胆放手方针，使东满解放区更加巩固和扩大。
