　　[This Newspaper News] Factories, mines, commercial firms, and cooperatives in various regions of Taihang continue to investigate and squeeze out feudal elements. The process of squeezing out feudalism at the Litai Coal Mine in Wu'an has been initially concluded, and now they are continuing to eradicate the roots. At the beginning of the movement, because the leadership did not conduct sufficient mobilization among the workers and cadres, and the leadership's thinking was not clear or unified, the landlord forces led by Cui Jinghua occupied leadership positions, sheltered feudal elements, and opposed the Lianyun campaign. Sabotage elements even took the opportunity to incite the masses to hate the village public offices and village cadres. After some party members, activists, and advanced people discovered the situation, they convened a worker-peasant congress on July 25, struggled against special agent Yang ××, and detained Cui Jinghua, re-adjusting the leadership group. Then, they conducted cadre and worker meetings to clarify the confused thinking. A large number of activists immediately emerged from among the workers and cadres, organizing a Feudalism Squeezing Committee Representative Meeting to directly lead the struggle. First, they investigated the nest of hidden struggle targets—the staff and workers' cooperative—uncovering startling results and embezzlement cases. Among the cooperative's 88 members, struggle targets and special agents accounted for 18, with shares of 940,000 yuan, accounting for 24.4% of the total, and squeezing out hidden materials such as wheat, clothing, and cash totaling more than 4 million yuan. Through this struggle, the entire factory squeezed out 41 struggle targets. Embezzlement and sabotage cases in the cooperative revealed that they had successively sold 6,240 silver dollars, 489 taels of silver ingots, and 121 jin and 10 taels of broken silver; they had also sold 16 items such as accordions, pistols, and rifles, 450 bullets, and 732 taels of opium, as well as having blank printed strips from the county government, the Wuwei Committee, and other organs, and sabotaging the Man-style boiler at the Liuhe Mine and destroying the Ci Mountain wheels. Factories in Changzhi have also successively launched campaigns to squeeze out feudal elements. In the movement, the Xinhua Paper Mill cleared out its manager, Wang Xinwen, who turned out to be a hidden landlord who disguised himself as a revolutionary to deceive the masses. In the past, he had led the enemy to burn, kill, loot, and plunder the people. Now, he was embezzling huge sums of money, engaging in private business, oppressing workers, and colluding with special agents. The workers used methods of speaking out, presenting evidence, and confronting the accused, making it impossible for Wang to deny his crimes. He has now been sent to the Public Security Bureau for further investigation. The Liberation Printing Plant also cleared out feudal special agent Li Lizhi, and the Wangsheng Factory investigated and squeezed out landlords Liu Shibao and Li Yangsuo, and sent them back to their villages along with their hidden burdens for the masses to deal with. During the movement at the Yixing Coal Mine in Neiqiu, struggle targets such as Jia Fengshan and Li Xiuyuan, who had falsely reported their village names and surnames, were discovered and removed. The 23 factories in Lucheng, under the leadership of the Trade Union, also took active action, clearing out 250 landlords and puppet soldiers. Pingshun also comprehensively rectified cooperatives and investigated and squeezed out feudal elements. In the Sixth District, a total of 124 special agents and landlords were cleared out from cooperatives of all sizes. After breaking through the paralyzed thinking and reliance on landlord technology, the village chiefs of the Second District's joint cooperative successively reported more than 50 special agents and landlords.
