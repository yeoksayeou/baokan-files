　　Three Great Advantages and Three Minor Advantages, the Masses Call it "Hero Wheat"
  　Taihang Area Competes to Plant 169
    [This newspaper, Taihang News] The Second Special District's Yu (She), Xiang (Yuan), Zuo (Quan), He (Shun), Xi (Yang), and Shou, Yu, Tai, Qi, and other nine counties, after the Beginning of Autumn, actively prepared to expand wheat fields. Yuci, based on the poor harvests in the summer and autumn seasons of this year, in addition to replanting autumn vegetables, proposed early on: "In order to prepare for weathering the famine next spring," expand wheat fields by 85,394 mu. The He Shun County government urgently called on the masses to plant 20,000 mu of wheat (He Shun's wheat harvest this year was 12,909.9 mu), preparing to overcome the period of food shortage. Currently, the masses in He, Xi, and other nine counties have successively entered the stage of tidying up wheat fields, repairing borders, building embankments, plowing the land, accumulating fertilizer, and exchanging seeds. After the leadership proposed expanding wheat fields, the masses discussed three types of wheat land: clean stubble wheat, converted stubble wheat, and wasteland wheat, all striving to get them ready before "Autumn Equinox Wheat Enters the Soil." In total, the nine counties plan to expand wheat fields by 739,164.6 mu.
    In expanding wheat fields, the masses are most willing to plant more "169" wheat. The masses in the Sixth District of Xiangyuan call it "Hero Wheat." Zhang Wanzhi, an old man from Dazhai in Yushe, said: "The seeds allocated to us last year were too few, it's a pity we didn't plant more. This year, we must plant more!" Zhang Zaiyuan said: "169" not only has three major advantages – drought resistance, cold resistance, and high yield – but also three minor advantages: "Not afraid of spring wind medicine; (spring wind and rain can kill local wheat); Not afraid of sparrows in summer (long awns make it difficult for sparrows to eat); Not prone to sprouting in heavy rain." The masses in Tancun are vying to exchange for "169" seeds. Currently, each county has formulated a plan to expand "169" wheat fields: Xiangyuan's summer crop was 1,904.54 mu, and this autumn it will be planted to 11,500 mu; He Shun's summer crop was 141.3 mu, and this autumn it will be planted to 4,578.32 mu; Yushe's summer crop was 231.47 mu, and this autumn it will be planted to 1,500 mu; Yuci's summer crop was 95 mu, and this autumn it will be planted to 346 mu; Zuoquan's summer crop was 1,385 mu, and this autumn it will be expanded to 2,000 mu; Shouyang will trial planting 100 mu this autumn. In total, the nine counties will expand the planting of "169" by 20,024.32 mu.
    [Also Reported] The Second Special Administrative Office and the Second Special District Bureau of Agriculture and Forestry reviewed the past shortcomings in allocating "169" wheat seeds, such as the leadership not grasping tightly, not being timely, and preparing late. In the allocation process, the masses' feelings progressed from anticipation and waiting to disappointment, even to "too late." Learning from past lessons, they allocated 30,000 jin of "169" wheat early, which, in addition to Xiangyuan, Yushe, and Zuoquan being self-sufficient, was distributed to Wuxiang, He Shun, Xiyang, Shouyang, Yuci, and other counties. They also urged each county to ensure that the seeds are distributed to the masses before wheat planting. (Li Qing)
    [This newspaper, Changzhi News] Changzhi's promotion of "169" wheat is now in its second year. Last year, only 93 mu were planted on a trial basis. According to this summer's drought, wheat yields have decreased, but each mu of "169" wheat in Dongcheng and other villages yielded about two dou more than local wheat. Through experiments and the propaganda of wheat competitions after the harvest, the masses' confidence in increasing production has been inspired. According to the masses' self-reporting, it is estimated that the county will plant 6,666 mu of "169" wheat this autumn, exceeding last year by seventy times. Based on this year's calculations, grain production will increase by approximately 1,999 shi and 8 dou. To solve the seed problem, in addition to what the county can provide itself, 46,976 jin of wheat seeds were transferred from Lucheng. They are now being distributed to the masses, organizing them to accumulate fertilizer and plow the land, preparing for large-scale planting. (Quan Cheng, Han Bao)

　　三大好三小好群众叫他“英雄麦”
  　太行各地争种一六九
    【本报太行讯】二专区榆（社）襄（垣）左（权）和（顺）昔（阳）及寿、榆、太、祁等九县，于立秋之后，积极准备扩大麦田。榆次根据今年夏秋两季歉收，除补种秋菜，及早提出：“为明春渡荒打算，”扩大麦田八万五千三百九十四亩。和顺县府紧急号召群众种麦两万亩（按和顺本年麦收为一万二千九百零九亩九分），准备渡过青黄不接时期。现和、昔等九县群众先后进入整理麦地、修边、垒堰、翻地、积肥、调换种籽。领导上提出扩大麦田之后，群众讨论三种麦地：净茬麦、改茬麦、荒地麦，均争取在“秋分麦入土”之前，整理好。总计九县共计划扩大麦田七十三万九千一百六十四亩六分。
    在扩大麦田中，群众最乐意多种“一六九”小麦。襄垣六区群众叫“英雄麦”，榆社大寨张万志老汉说：“去年给俺调剂的种籽太少了，可惜没多种上，今年可得多种哩！”张在元说：“一六九”不但有三大好——抗旱、耐寒、产量大，——还有三小好：春风不怕药；（春天风雨能药死土麦）夏天不怕雀（麦芒长不易雀吃）；雨多不生芽”。潭村群众争先恐后调换“一六九”种籽。现各县均订出扩大“一六九”麦田计划：襄垣今夏为一九○四·五四亩，今秋要种到一一五○○亩；和顺今夏为一四一·三亩，今秋要种到四五七八·三二亩，榆社今夏为二三一·四七亩，今秋要种到一五○○亩；榆次今夏为九五亩，今秋要种到三四六亩；左权今夏为一三八五亩，今秋扩大种二○○○亩；寿阳今秋试种一○○亩。总计九县扩大种“一六九”共二○○二四·三二亩。
    【又讯】二专署，二专农林局，检讨过去在调剂“一六九”小麦种籽当中，领导上抓不紧，不及时，准备晚。在调剂中，群众心情由盼、等、到误，以至“马后炮”。接收往年教训，及早调剂“一六九”小麦三万斤，除襄垣、榆社、左权自给外，分发武乡、和顺、昔阳、寿阳、榆次等县。并督促各县在种麦前，保证发到群众手里。（李青）
    【本报长治讯】长治推广“一六九”麦现在已是第二年了，去年全县仅试种九十三亩，按今年夏季天旱，麦收都已减收，东呈等村每亩“一六九”麦比土麦均增收三斗左右，经过实验和麦收后的赛麦会宣传，启发了群众增产信心。根据群众的自报，统计今秋全县要种“一六九”麦六千六百六十六亩，超过去年七十倍，按今年计算，约增产粮一千九百九十九石八斗。种籽问题，除本县解决部分外，到潞城又调剂来麦种四万六千九百七十六斤，现在正给群众散发，组织群众积肥犁地，准备大量下种。（全成、韩保）
