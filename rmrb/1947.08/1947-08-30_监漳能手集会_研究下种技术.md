　　【Benbao Wuxiang Xun】 After the third weeding of autumn seedlings, Jianzhang and other villages in the Fourth District convened a meeting of village technical experts to discuss expanding wheat fields, allocating 169 wheat seeds, and studying wheat planting techniques. Everyone believed that expanding wheat fields this year would not only compensate for the reduced autumn harvest and help people survive the spring famine, but also support the front lines in defeating Chiang Kai-shek. Regarding methods, they discussed first tidying up the "tail-end barren land" (land not yet cleared) and the clean-stubble wheat barren land, and actively planning to convert stubble wheat land. Cutting artemisia, composting manure, hoeing edges, and building embankments were all carried out simultaneously. In the study of techniques, Cui Wanliang from Jianzhang introduced using twelve taels of salt per dou of wheat, soaking the seeds in salt water, then taking them out and washing them with clean water to disinfect them and reduce disease. An old technical expert from Xinzhuang introduced the famous Xinzhuang wheat planting method of Wuxiang. He said, "Wheat needs to be smoked, and the plow needs to be wide. Even with the rains of the eighth, tenth, and third months, the land still needs to be turned over in the dog days." He strongly agreed with seed disinfection by soaking and also emphasized fertilizer and cultivation for wheat planting. He said, "Wide plowing of wheat land allows ventilation, resulting in thick stalks, and sunny slopes are even better." In studying the 169 wheat planting method, everyone believed that it was generally similar, but attention should be paid to: (1) sowing five to seven days earlier; (2) using fewer seeds, with an average of seven jin per mu (new scale, six jin for good land); (3) wider row spacing for easy ventilation; and (4) avoiding summer wetland and facilitating drainage.

　　监漳能手集会　研究下种技术
    【本报武乡讯】四区监漳等村，在秋苗三锄之后，召开了村技术能手会，讨论扩大麦田，调剂一六九小麦种籽，研究种麦技术。大家认为今年扩大麦田，不但弥补今秋减收渡春荒，还要支援前线打败蒋介石。在办法上，讨论出先整理好“尾巴荒地”（未灭的地）、净茬麦荒地，并积极筹划改茬麦地。割蒿、沤粪、刨边、垒堰，一齐下手。在研究技术上，监漳崔万良介绍了用十二两盐一斗麦子，用盐水浸种后，取出再用清水洗一下，消了毒少生病。新庄老技术能手介绍了武乡有名的新庄小麦种法。他说：“麦要熏，犁要宽，虽有八、十、三月雨，还得伏天把地翻”。他很赞成浸种消毒，又很讲究种麦的肥料、耕作。他说：“麦地犁宽通风，秆粗，阳坡地更好。”在研究一六九小麦种法上，大家认为大体相仿，但要注意：（一）提前下种五、七天；（二）种籽要稀，每亩平均七斤（新秤，好地六斤）；（三）行距要宽大，易通风；（四）避免夏湿地，排水容易。（李青）
