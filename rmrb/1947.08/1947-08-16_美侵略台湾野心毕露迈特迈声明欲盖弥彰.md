Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, August 14th: After completing his two-day "visit" to Taiwan, Wedemeyer left Taiwan for Shanghai on the 13th and will proceed to Guangzhou within days. Wedemeyer's activities in Taiwan fully confirmed the reports from various sources about the U.S. plan to invade Taiwan, which had been reported long ago. In addition to staying in Taipei, Wedemeyer also went to "inspect" the two major ports of Keelung and Kaohsiung. An August 13th U.S. Information Service dispatch from Shanghai stated: Wedemeyer concentrated his activities in Taiwan in Taipei, Keelung, and Kaohsiung. According to a Central News Agency report, Wedemeyer "toured" the port in Keelung and "visited" the Zuoying naval base in Kaohsiung. In Taipei, Wedemeyer "separately met" with Chia Yu-hui, the former deputy commander of the New First Army and deputy commander of the KMT Army Training Command. Wedemeyer also invited Chia to visit Keelung with him. Deeply fearing that his plan to invade Taiwan has been exposed, Wedemeyer once again repeated his clumsy tactic of "protesting too much," publicly telling Huang Chao-chin, the Speaker of the Taiwan KMT Assembly, that "the United States has no ambitions for Taiwan," and issued a statement through the U.S. Consulate in Taiwan, denying the "inaccuracy" of the claim that the United States would use Taiwan as a base for training KMT troops.

　　美侵略台湾野心毕露迈特迈声明欲盖弥彰
    【新华社陕北十四日电】魏德迈完成其台湾两日“访问”后，已于十三日离台飞上海，日内再由上海去广州。魏在台湾之活动，充分证实各方消息久已报导之美国侵略台湾计划。魏除在台北停住外，并去“视察”了基隆和高雄两巨港。美新闻处十三日上海电称：魏德迈在台将其活动集中于台北、基隆及高雄等地。据中央社消息，魏氏在基隆曾“游览”港口，在高雄“参观”左营海军基地，魏氏在台北“单独接见”了国民党陆军训练副司令前新一军副军长贾幼慧，魏并邀贾同往基隆视察。魏深惧其侵台计划已被揭露，又一次重复其“此地无银三十两”之拙劣作法，在一次座谈会中当众向台湾国民党议长黄朝琴力言“美国对台湾无任何野心”，并通过驻台美领事馆发表声明，辩解美国将以台湾作训练国民党军队基地一事之“不确”。
