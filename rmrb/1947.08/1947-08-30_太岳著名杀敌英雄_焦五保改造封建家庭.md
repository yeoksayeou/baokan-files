　　Taiyue Famous Enemy-Killing Hero
  　Jiao Wubao Transforms Feudal Family
　　[Xinhua News Agency Jinji-Luyu 27th Dispatch] Jiao Wubao, a famous enemy-killing hero of the Taiyue People's Liberation Army, resolved to transform his family during the class ideology investigation movement in the army. Jiao Wubao's family was an old rich peasant family, owning more than 80 mu of land and 70 or 80 sheep. His father had served as a village deputy in the old regime and lent grain at usurious rates. In the past, he felt uneasy when he heard the news of his family being liquidated, but as a hero, it was inconvenient for him to speak out. During this all-army ideological investigation, he was moved by the complaints of his comrades in the company and said, "My family used to obtain rent and profit and exploit the poor. Today, I am determined to abandon the position of feudal exploiters." He immediately asked his comrades in the platoon to write two letters for him. In the letter to his mother, he wrote, "The masses want to struggle. You should completely accept it; if the masses do not dare to struggle, you should ask them to struggle." In the letter to the village cadres, he said, "It is necessary to mobilize the masses to thoroughly struggle against my feudal family, cancel preferential treatment, completely change my class status, and help my family become a progressive working family."

　　太岳著名杀敌英雄
  　焦五保改造封建家庭
    【新华社晋冀鲁豫二十七日电】太岳解放军著名杀敌英雄焦五保，在部队查阶级思想运动中，立志改造自己家庭。焦五保家庭是个旧富农，有地八十余亩，羊七八十只，父亲曾在旧政权时当过村副，放过粮债。过去他听到家中被清算的消息心中不安，但自己当了英雄，又不便说出来。此次全军查思想，他在全连同志的诉苦中，感动的说：“我家过去是得租、得利、坑过穷人的，今天我要坚决抛弃封建剥削者的立场。”并马上请班里同志写了两封信，给他母亲的信中写道：“群众要斗争。应完全接受；如群众不敢斗，就要求斗争。”写给村干部的信中说：“要发动群众，彻底斗透我的封建家庭，取消优待，把我的成份完全改变，帮助我家变成一个进步的劳动家庭。”
