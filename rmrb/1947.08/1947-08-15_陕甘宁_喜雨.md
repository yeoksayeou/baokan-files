　　Shaanxi-Gansu-Ningxia
  　Welcome Rain
    [Xinhua News Agency, Northwest, 10th] Good rain in the Shaanxi-Gansu-Ningxia Border Region. Since the beginning of summer, rainfall in various parts of the Border Region has been insufficient, and autumn crops have suffered from drought. Starting from the 26th of last month, most areas have experienced continuous rainfall, with rainfall ranging from two to five inches, bringing smiles to the faces of farmers. The Northwest Bureau of the CPC Central Committee has issued instructions, calling on the army and civilians of the entire region to mobilize all manpower and animal power to rush-plant buckwheat and autumn vegetables. For farmers serving in war support, mobilize the masses to help each other, and all military units and agencies must do their best to help the masses rush-plant.

    【新华社西北十日电】陕甘宁边区喜雨。入夏以来，边区各地雨量不足，秋禾受旱。上月二十六日开始，大部地区连降甘霖，雨量二寸至五寸不等，农民笑逐颜开。中共中央西北局特发指示，号召全区军民动员所有人力畜力抢种荞麦与秋菜。对于服务战勤的农民，发动群众互助，各部队机关必须尽力帮助群众抢种。
