[Report from the Jinnan Bureau on the 15th] "Saving labor and intensifying hoeing for sideline production, earning money to buy cattle and add farm tools"; In Xiangchenggu, Zhou Yonghua's team in the First District of Qiu County, due to mutual aid in delivering manure and sowing seeds during the spring plowing, each mu saved five workdays. The entire team of 505 mu saved a total of 2,275 workdays. The work was completed quickly, and the hoeing was started early, so it was possible to hoe once more. Large seedlings were hoeed five times, and small seedlings were hoeed three times. The surplus labor was used for sideline production, and an oil mill and a flour mill were established, earning more than 2 million yuan. The profits were used to buy a cow, 18 pigs, and the groups also added some farm tools. Each of the 86 people in the team received a dividend of 20,000 yuan. They are now planning to buy cattle and pigs collectively to accumulate fertilizer or buy grain for storage in preparation for famine. Zhou Yonghua was elected as a labor hero by the entire village. The masses said: "Zhou Yonghua is a great banner on our Xiangchenggu street."

  　赚钱买牛添农具
    【本报冀南十五日电】“省工加锄搞副业，赚钱买牛添农具”；邱县一区香城固周永华大队，在春耕中由于互助送粪下种，每亩省工五个，全队五百零五亩共省工二百七十五个，活做完的快插锄就早，所以能够加锄一遍，大苗锄了五遍，小苗锄了三遍。互助剩余劳力搞副业，成立了香油坊、粉坊，赚洋二百多万元，盈利买牛一头、猪十八只，各组更添了些农具，全队八十六人每人分红利二万元。现正计划伙买牛买猪，以积肥或买粮蓄存以备荒。周永华被全村选为劳动英雄，群众说：“周永华是咱香城固街上的一杆大旗。”
