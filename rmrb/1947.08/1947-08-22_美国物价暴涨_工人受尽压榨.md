Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, August 20th: New York dispatch: Prices of most basic daily necessities in the United States have soared to the highest peak in American history and are continuing to rise. According to a conservative report by the Labor Department, the prices of basic daily necessities in mid-June had already risen to a record high of 157.1 percent of the 1935-39 level. Prices in many cities have generally risen by 300 to 400 percent. Although the public has repeatedly requested the administrative authorities to take emergency measures, so far no measures have been taken. Most businessmen are pessimistic about the economic prospects, and "U.S. News," a weekly magazine that is often well-informed about economic issues, also admits that "American workers are suffering from the exploitation of wages and prices, which has squeezed out their wartime real wage income." The magazine continued: "American inflation is still continuing rapidly. When prices rise to a certain point, it will limit the needs of the domestic market. When the needs of the foreign market decrease, if the domestic market also decreases at the same time, then we must be very careful."

　　美国物价暴涨　工人受尽压榨
    【新华社陕北二十日电】纽约讯：美国大部分基本日用品价格已涨至美国历史上的最高峰，并在继续上涨。据保守的劳工部报告估计，六月中旬基本日用品价格已涨至一九三五——三九年水平的百分之一五七点一的最高纪录。许多城市的物价，普遍上涨百分之三百至四百。民众虽然再三要求行政当局采取紧急措施，但迄今为止，尚无任何措施可言。一般商人对经济前途咸表悲观，对经济问题经常灵通的“美国新闻”周刊亦承认：“美国工人受尽工资物价的压榨，这种压榨已绞尽了他们的战时实际工资所得。”该杂志继称：“美国通货膨胀仍急速继续中，在物价涨到某点时，便将限制国内市场之需要。当国外市场需要减少时，如果国内市场也要同时减少，那时候就得大大提防了。”
