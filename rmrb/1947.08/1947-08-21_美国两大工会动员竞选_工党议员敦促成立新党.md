Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 16th: New York dispatch: The American Congress of Industrial Organizations and the American Federation of Labor have begun mobilizing their members to prepare for the 1948 presidential election. The United Steelworkers of America, one of the three major unions under the CIO, held a joint meeting of its 530 staff members on the 11th. CIO Chairman Murray attended and reported, and a plan was adopted to greatly increase the participation of its 870,000 members in the activities of the Political Action Committee. The plan openly disregards the Taft-Hartley Act's prohibition on using union funds for political activities and decides to raise a political action fund. Tobin, president of the AFL Teamsters Union, which has 900,000 members, said in a speech at the union's convention that he believes that if the labor movement can be fairly unified, the American labor movement, which has the potential strength of 37 million voters, could become the foundation of a third party. AFL President Green also declared at the meeting that the AFL will organize the strongest campaign next year to strive for the goal of abolishing the Taft-Hartley Act and changing the conservative tendencies of Congress. He opposes the Republican Party nominating Taft as a presidential candidate. "If he is nominated as a candidate, he will suffer the most disastrous defeat due to the organized opposition of workers." At the same time, American Labor Party Congressman Marcantonio, speaking at a Labor Party meeting in Brooklyn on the 11th, urged the formation of a third party in the 1948 election. He predicted that this party would become a major party by 1952. He said: "The increasing consensus between the Democratic and Republican parties on all important issues and their surrender to the great monopoly capital forces the formation of a new party."

　　美国两大工会动员竞选　工党议员敦促成立新党
    【新华社陕北十六日电】纽约讯：美国产业工会联合会与劳工联合会已开始动员其会员，迎接一九四八年的总统选举。产联下属三大工会之一钢铁工人联合会，十一日在其五百三十名职员的联席会上，产联主席莫莱曾出席报告，并通过大量吸收其八十七万会员参加政治行动委员会活动的计划。该计划公开不顾塔虎脱法案禁止利用工会基金作政治活动的规定，决定募集政治行动基金。拥有九十万会员的劳联司机工会主席托宾，在该工会大会上演说时，表示相信如果劳工运动能相当统一，则保有三千七百万选民潜在力量的美国工运，可能成为第三党的基础。劳联主席格林亦在会上宣称：劳联将于明年组织最强大的竞选，向废除塔虎脱法案及改变国会保守倾向的目标奋斗。他反对共和党提塔虎脱为总统候选人。“如果他被提为候选人，他将因工人有组织的反对而遭受最惨重的失败。”同时，美工党众议员马肯托尼奥十一日在布鲁克林区工党会议上发言时，敦促在四八年选举时成立第三党。他预言这一政党至一九五二年就会变成大党。他说：“民主党与共和党在一切重要问题上之日趋一致及对大独占资本的投降，逼得非成立新党不可。”
