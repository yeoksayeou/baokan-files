　　Wu'an Third and Eighth Districts Organize Rush Weeding
　　Women and Children Universally Go to the Fields

　　[Our Newspaper News] The area west and south of Wu'an city, including the Third and Eighth Districts, is currently engaged in a concentrated effort to weed seedlings. A significant characteristic is the large number of women and children universally going to the fields. A few days ago, a reporter traveling from Boyan Town in the Third District to Dahe Village in the Eighth District observed farmers in groups of three or five along the ten-mile road, diligently weeding seedlings. Approximately two-fifths of them were women, and one-fifth were children, with men comprising only a small portion. One twelve-year-old girl and three boys were using large hoes to weed a patch of millet seedlings. Focused entirely on competing with others, they didn't look around at all, and weeded with great enthusiasm. According to the Third District Committee, dozens of villages in this area have a severe shortage of male labor, with women and children outnumbering men by two or three times. In previous years, they mostly did needlework, but this year they are universally organized to participate in agricultural work. One reason is that many peasants who previously had no land, little land, or bad land now have enough good land, and are motivated to work. Another reason is that leaders promptly praise exemplary individuals, and they feel that participating in production brings both fame and benefit. A further reason is that many villages have implemented distribution according to work, which everyone finds fair, and they are willing to organize together, which is lively and saves labor. In villages such as Yehe and Tonghui, some women now weed as quickly as men and can earn full credit. There are also fewer instances of them stepping on and damaging seedlings because they cannot stand firmly or grip the hoe tightly. Many children can earn five, six, or seven points, equivalent to one-half to two-thirds of an adult's. In terms of leadership methods, attention has been paid to organizing competitions and praising models to encourage production enthusiasm. Women and children are even more competitive, and many women have quickly improved their weeding skills, catching up with men. Due to the participation of women and children, the labor force has been strengthened. After the heavy rain at the end of last month, while rushing to plant and eliminate barren land, they also launched a concentrated effort to weed seedlings, ensuring that not a single acre of land planted earlier was abandoned. Some have already begun the second weeding, and those planted after the heavy rain have also begun the first weeding. In Nanhe Village, Eighth District, the labor force is smaller than in previous years, but by organizing women and children, the first weeding required 400 fewer day laborers than in previous years (previously 500 were used, this year only 40), saving 3,500 jin of rice (7 jin per worker).

　　[Our Newspaper Jin City News] West Hao Village in the Second District of this county, with the nine regularly mutual aid groups in the village as the core, united and organized all full and semi-labor force, women and children in the village to participate in weeding seedlings, a total of 340 men and women full and semi-labor force, 100 children, forming a village-wide great labor exchange. After organizing, they first discussed and decided whose seedlings should be weeded first, whose seedlings should be weeded later, which seedlings should be weeded first, and which seedlings should be weeded later. First, they weeded all 790 mu of beans in the village, and then weeded 250 mu of millet seedlings for 32 families of military dependents and martyrs who lacked labor. Then, according to the size of the seedlings in the whole village, they decided to weed the larger ones first, and weeded all 700 mu of millet seedlings in the village for the third time in three days. An average of one mu of seedlings was weeded per person per day. After the third weeding, at the summary commendation meeting, everyone unanimously selected Li Maidan's group as a model. This group has 20 people, and women accounted for half. (Wang Yi)

　　[Our Newspaper News] Houchi, She County, held a meeting of production activists on July 29 to discuss how to organize men and women full and semi-labor force to participate in the rush weeding campaign. Liu Xishou said: "Our group has 31 full labor force, but if women, children and old men go to weed, we can add 45 semi-labor force, which can be equivalent to full labor force." Hero Liu Shiyan said: "In weeding seedlings, we must mobilize all semi-labor force to participate in weeding. Male full labor force can be drawn to Wu'an to sell labor." Each mutual aid group formulated a weeding plan, and all small seedling land of 852 mu in the village will be completed in twelve days. In carrying out this campaign, models were summarized and commended every day, and children sang clappers on the streets to promote it, so that men, women, old and young competed to participate in this campaign. A total of 122 male labor force, 54 male semi-labor force, and 221 women and children participated, and the twelve-day plan was completed in nine days. A total of 1,266 male labor force were saved, earning 7,596 jin of millet (6 jin of rice per worker). In the campaign, 12 women models and 15 male models were selected. There are already 42 male labor force going to Wu'an to sell labor. (Weeding Small Newspaper)

　　[Our Newspaper South Hebei Fourteenth Dispatch] In Jing County's weeding campaign, women enthusiastically participate and strive to be models. Fifteen village cadres in the Fifth District of the county led men and women to mutually assist in weeding late seedlings after returning from the district meeting, and weeded a total of 9,094 mu in four days; there are still more than 2,000 mu that cannot be weeded due to the wet and low-lying terrain. In the previous stage of weeding, there were 386 women who weeded more than 700 mu. The Sisters' Troupe organized a contracted team to weed one mu for the elderly, weak, and widowed, with a wage of 600 yuan, which is 200 yuan lower than the general wage. Ye Guirong, deputy director of the Women's Federation of Mengzhuang, and members of the Lu Junqing family and others led the women of the whole village to the fields to weed seedlings, working the same as men. In the weeding, each village carried out timely evaluation and selection of models. Twenty-one men and women, including Yan Zhuang, director of the Armed Forces Committee, militia captain, Mengzhuang Women's Federation director Ye Guirong and Lu Junqing's family, were elected. He Guangtian used to be gluttonous and lazy, but this time he also became a model.

　　武安三、八区组织抢锄
  　妇女儿童普遍上地
    【本报讯】武安城西、南三、八区一带正突击锄苗，其显著特点之一是大量妇女儿童普遍下地。记者前几天从三区伯延镇往八区大贺庄走，十来里的路旁农民三五成群，正在紧张锄苗，其中约有五分之二是妇女，五分之一是儿童，男人只占少半。有一个十二岁的女孩和三个男孩都拿着大锄，伙锄着一块谷苗，因要和别人竞赛，他们一点不左顾右盼，锄得非常起劲。据三区区委说，这一带有数十村都很缺少男劳力，妇女儿童超过男人两三倍，往年她们顶多只做做针线，今年则普遍组织起来参加农作。一个原因是许多无地、少地、地坏的农民都有了足够的好地，干起来有劲，一个原因是领导及时表扬模范，他们感到参加生产，名利双全，还有一个原因是不少村已实行按活计分，大家觉得公道，愿意组织起来，又热闹，又省工。野河、同会等村现在有些妇女锄得和男人一样快，能记全分；因站不稳脚、把不紧锄而踏坏锄坏的也不很多了。不少儿童能记到五、六、七分，顶大人二分之一到三分之二。在领导方法上注意了组织竞赛，大批表摸鼓舞生产热情，妇女儿童的争胜心更强，有不少妇女锄苗技术很快提高，赶上男人。由于妇女儿童的参加，使劳力增强，上月底透雨后，一面抢种，消灭了白地，一面突击锄苗，使以前抢种的地一亩未荒，有些现已开始锄二遍，透雨后抢种的，也已开始头锄。八区南贺庄劳力比往常年少，由于组织起妇女儿童，锄头遍苗就比往年少雇用四百余短工（往年用五百多，今年只四十个），省米三千五百斤（每工七斤）。（东）
    【本报晋城讯】本县二区西浩村以村内的经常互助的九个组为核心，团结与组织起村内一切全半劳动力、妇女儿童参加锄苗，共组织起男女全半劳动力三百四十人，儿童一百人，形成全村大变工。组织起后先讨论，决定谁家的苗先锄，谁家的苗后锄，哪样苗该先锄，哪样苗该后锄。首先锄完了全村七百九十亩豆子，又给缺乏劳动力的三十二家军烈属锄了二百五十亩谷苗，然后按着全村苗大小，决定先锄大的，三天内就把全村七百余亩谷苗锄完了第三遍。平均每人每天锄苗一亩。锄完三遍苗后，总结评功会上，大家一致选出李麦旦组为模范，他这组共二十人，妇女就占了一半。（王毅）
    【本报讯】涉县后池在七月廿九号召开生产积极分子会，讨论如何组织男女全半劳力参加突击锄苗运动。刘希寿说：“我组全劳力，卅一个，妇女儿童老汉都去锄可增四十五个半劳力，就能顶上全劳力工。”英雄刘士炎说：“在锄苗中我们要发动一切半劳力参加锄苗，男全劳力可抽出人去武安卖工。”各个互助组都订了锄苗计划，全村小苗地八百五十二亩十二天完成。在进行这一运动时，每天总结表模，儿童唱着快板在街头宣传，这样男女老少争着参加这一运动，计参加男劳力一百二十二个，男半劳力五十四个，妇女儿童二百二十一个，十二天计划九天完成，共省男劳力一千二百六十六个，能赚小米七千五百九十六斤（每工按六斤米），运动中选出妇女模范十二名，男模范十五名，已有四十二个男劳力到武安去卖工。（锄苗小报）
    【本报冀南十四日电】景县锄苗，妇女热烈参加争作模范。该县一区第五小区十五个村村干自区开会回来，带领男女互助锄晚苗，四天共锄九千零九十四亩；还有二千余亩，因地势湿凹不能动锄。上阶段锄苗中有妇女三百八十六人，锄苗七百余亩。姐妹团组织了包工组，给老弱孤寡锄一亩，工资六百元，比一般工资低二百元；孟庄妇会副主任野桂荣和会员吕俊青家等七人，率领全村妇女下地锄苗，和男人一样干。在锄苗中，各村进行及时的评选模范，阎庄武委会主任、民兵队长、孟庄妇会主任野桂荣和吕俊青家等男女二十一名当选。何光田过去好吃懒做，这次也当了模范。
