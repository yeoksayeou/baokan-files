    沙河 New District's Method of Combining Agriculture and Sideline Occupations
    [This newspaper's Shahe News] After the mutual aid organizations in the Shahe New District implemented equivalent consolidation, many places have surplus labor. This labor has been used in sideline occupations, so the combination of agriculture and sideline occupations has developed. According to the currently understood materials, the methods of combining agriculture and sideline occupations are as follows:
    1. Profit Distribution Method: The Liu Fengtian group in Qianjing Village, Third District, extracted two people to carry poles, carrying the village's jujube noodles and black dates to the east to exchange for cloth and cotton, and then carrying them to the west to exchange for grain. The people who go out also contribute labor in the mutual aid group, and their land is cultivated by others. They eat within the group when they are outside. After deducting consumption, the profits are divided three-seven, with labor accounting for 70% of the total labor of the group (people who go out also share according to work points), and capital shares accounting for 30%. 2. Contracting Method: Hao De group in Xicui had one person go out to weave mats, contracting his family's land to the group. For example, when watering wheat, he pays 25,000 yuan for his ten mu of wheat, guaranteeing three waterings and three hoeings. The money he earns is not distributed as profit; it is a method of paying wages to contract hoeing, but it can improve the mutual aid group's enthusiasm for cultivating his land. 3. Paying Wages: This method is very common in the New District. Households in Beizhang Village who go out to transport goods have their land cultivated by the mutual aid group, and they pay wages. Because Zhang Zhenjing's group in Xicui earns a lot of money from making mats, in addition to paying wages according to equivalent value, they also extract 30% of his profits to give to the mutual aid group. However, this is done with the consent of both parties. Although he contributed a portion of his profits, his family's land does not need to be settled. (Kuí Lín)

    沙河新区农副业结合办法
    【本报沙河讯】沙河新区的互助组织经过实行等价巩固以后，不少地方都有了剩余劳力，这些劳力都使用到了副业方面，因此农副业的结合也就发展起来，根据目前了解材料，农副业的结合办法有以下几种：
    一、分红办法：三区浅井村刘风田组抽出两人担挑，把本村的甜枣面和黑枣担到东边换回布和棉花，再担到西边去换粮食。出去的人在互助中也顶工，他的地由别人养种，他在外就吃到里边。除去消耗以外，红利是三、七分，劳力是按全组人工的多少分七成（出外的人也按工分红），资本股分三成。二、包工办法：西崔郝德组一人出去编席子，把家里的地包给组内。如浇麦时，他十亩麦子出两万五千元工资，保证浇三遍锄三遍。他赚的钱不分红，是一种出工资包锄地的办法，但可以提高互助组给他种地的积极性。三、出工资：这种办法在新区十分普遍，北掌村出外运输的户，家里地互助组给养种，他出工资。西崔张振经组因打席子赚钱多，除了按等价给了工资外，再把他的红利抽出三成给互助组。不过这是经过双方同意的，他虽出了一部红利，但家里地就不用结记了。（奎林）
