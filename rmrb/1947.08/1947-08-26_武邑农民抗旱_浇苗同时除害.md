　　【This newspaper, Jinnan, 24th】 Wu Yi's liberated farmers are convinced that "man will conquer nature" and are determined to overcome the drought. According to incomplete statistics, the county has renovated 52 old wells, dug 542 earthen wells, and used all available water to irrigate 11,859 mu of seedlings. They have also collected 269,136 jin of wild vegetables (already dried). The leadership has recently allocated 500,000 in bonuses, calling for the widespread elimination of the "three pests." In the past 20 days, the county has captured more than 34,000 cicadas, more than 16,000 rats, and more than 27,000 sparrows. In addition, 498 bird eggs were taken, and the mobilization led to the consumption of more than 1,400 pigeons, reducing considerable damage to the autumn seedlings. In the struggle against drought, the liberated farmers demonstrated a high degree of tenacity and fortitude. For example, the masses in Li Guan Village used 20 carts to haul water to irrigate the land, and have now irrigated more than 100 mu. Han Jia Village alone dug more than 60 earthen wells. In Beiyunqi Village, 26 women collected more than 800 jin of vegetables in one night, and 96 children collected more than 3,000 jin of vegetables in three days. In Renjiao Village, the masses carried 800 loads of water in three days, irrigating 42 mu of land and collecting more than 8,500 jin of vegetables.
