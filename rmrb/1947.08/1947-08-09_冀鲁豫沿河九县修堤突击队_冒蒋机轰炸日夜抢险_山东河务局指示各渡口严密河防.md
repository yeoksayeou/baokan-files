Xinhua News Agency, Jin-Ji-Lu-Yu, 7th. The dike repair shock brigades in the nine counties along the river in Ji-Lu-Yu, including Shou Zhang, Fan County, Dun (?), Pu County, Yuncheng, etc., are working day and night to repair embankments. The Dun (?) Mountain to Yunbei Zhong Dun (?) Dike was mostly completed on the 27th. Currently, hundreds of thousands of people along the river are braving Chiang Kai-shek's bombing to transport stones and straw materials overnight.

Xinhua News Agency, Shandong, 7th. In order to strictly prevent Chiang Kai-shek's bandit gang from carrying out its conspiracy to flood the Yellow River, the Shandong Provincial River Affairs Bureau has issued special instructions to all docks and ferry crossings to implement light control at night and strict guard day and night to prevent sabotage by Chiang Kai-shek's planes and special agents. Vessels at ferry crossings and all means of transportation should be strictly protected. The Yellow River Management Offices in the counties along the river should quickly disperse and conceal the straw materials gathered near various dangerous works, and cooperate with the county governments to mobilize villagers within 20 li along the river to sew several cloth bags per household for emergency repairs. During the period of major flooding, the joint defense forces within 10 li along the river must devote all their efforts to the Yellow River management and prevent bandits and special agents, and protect the safety of river dams, dangerous works, and workers. Flood prevention teams along the river should strengthen flood prevention drills and education. The bureau recently sent a letter to commend the workers at the Yellow River docks who actively completed the transportation tasks despite the harassment of Chiang Kai-shek's planes, calling on them to make persistent efforts to overcome Chiang Kai-shek's flooding conspiracy. It was also decided to improve the living conditions of the workers, switch to using fine grains for the whole month, and all workers harmed by Chiang Kai-shek's bandits would receive the same treatment as revolutionary workers, and their families would receive the same treatment as families of revolutionary martyrs and military workers.

Xinhua News Agency, Shandong, 7th. Chiang Kai-shek's troops, entrenched in the area of Hujia'an, Saogouzi, and Daokou on the south bank of the Yellow River in the Zhangqiu-Licheng county of the Bohai Sea District, have repeatedly sabotaged seven dangerous works along the Yellow River on the north bank of the liberated area, including Gou Yangjia, Daliushudianzi, and Xingjiadu. In mid-June, in Gou Yangjia alone, they kidnapped three civilian laborers transporting bricks and 20 head of livestock. Since July 1st, Chiang Kai-shek's planes have been strafing along the river day and night, hindering the progress of the project. Now, the river defense team organized by the people of the county, regardless of all dangers, is stepping up repairs.
