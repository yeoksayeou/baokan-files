Several Forms of Mutual Aid Teams in Gaoping

Gaoping County has little land and a large population, with an average of two and a half mu of land per person. Agricultural income is not enough to maintain life, and there is a lot of surplus labor. Sideline occupations and handicrafts are very developed, and the total annual income exceeds agriculture, even by several times. There are many skilled workers of all kinds. Before the War of Resistance Against Japan, there were 30,000 workers in the county, accounting for slightly less than one-ninth of the county's population of 280,000. Under these circumstances, the emancipated peasants adapted to local conditions and organized various forms of mutual aid teams:

I. Mutual aid teams with part-time work and part-time farming: In many villages in the Fifth District, almost all men can make nails and go down to the coal mines. This income is several times greater than that from agriculture, but the peasants still have a small amount of land. In order to take into account both work and agriculture, they voluntarily organized themselves. A certain village has a mutual aid team of seven people, forming a nail furnace. They share one furnace and hire one person to pull the bellows. Each person uses their own iron to make their own nails. When it is busy with farming, everyone works together in the fields, calculating work points. After the field work is done, they make nails again.

II. Mutual aid teams with division of labor between industry and agriculture: The Shen Jinxi Mutual Aid Team in Sanjia is composed of six families with nine people (six full laborers and three half laborers). In January this year, they pooled sixteen dan of millet to open a cargo furnace. They hired a manager, an accountant, and two skilled workers. Six people in their mutual aid team had skills and also participated in the cargo furnace work, earning five sheng of rice per day. At the same time, they used the non-working time of the cargo furnace in the morning or evening (no work in the morning when firing, no work in the afternoon when making models) to work in the fields together with the mutual aid team members. They divided the day into ten parts, with a daily wage of four sheng of rice. Two livestock plus one person working for half a day earned two and a half dou of rice. They implemented a work-point system for recording work and calculating accounts. In addition, whenever the cargo furnace had work, as long as it was during the agricultural slack season, they would try their best to call people from their own mutual aid team to do it. From the time they opened the business to the wheat harvest, each share (one dan of grain) was divided into forty liang of goods, and one liang of goods could be sold for seven hundred yuan.

The benefits of this combination are that industry and agriculture cooperate, labor and capital cooperate, farmers have enough land to cultivate, and workers can work with peace of mind. Moreover, they can also work in the fields during their spare time, and both sides have high production and no idle time. Farmers can also get higher and readily available wages.

III. Method of Regularly Combining Agriculture and Sideline Occupations: For example, the Wang Daoshi Mutual Aid Team in Zhao Village consists of five people who pooled several dan of grain. They do not rest at noon every day, but use this time to take turns grinding flour, and then take turns going out to exchange the flour. They can grind three to five dou of grain into flour a day. Grinding one dou of grain earns one jin of flour. The remaining residue can also be used to feed pigs. Another example is the Han Jiusuo Mutual Aid Team in Dingbi, which consists of five people. Among them, four people pooled one dan and eight dou of sorghum and rice each, plus 2,500 yuan, which was counted as one share. One person was in charge of sifting flour when grinding flour, and he contributed half a share, with labor making up the other half. Together, the five people contributed one share each. Among them, four families each had cattle in partnership with others, and one family had a donkey. They only used the donkey to pull the mill early in the morning, and then each family used cattle to repay work, with one cattle work being equal to three mornings of donkey work.

The benefits of this combination are: (1) It makes full use of the agricultural slack time, and some even make use of the noon break time for labor. (2) In addition to earning dividends, it can also be used to feed pigs and accumulate fertilizer, increasing agricultural output.

IV. Method of Division of Labor and Cooperation Between Agriculture and Transportation and Marketing: This is the case with the Han Songgen Mutual Aid Team in Guo Village, the Former Ninth Bao Mutual Aid Team in Chen Village, and the Zhao Dongcheng Mutual Aid Team in Kouze. They are all several people who combine together, pool some capital, and select one or two people with experience in transportation and marketing to engage in transportation and marketing work. Everyone shares the cost of meals and expenses when going out, and then one work point is exchanged for one work point. The people at home cultivate the land for those who are away. During the agricultural slack season, everyone sometimes goes together to do it collectively. For example, the Han Songgen Mutual Aid Team went to Dumu Village in Heyang to carry grain, which was very profitable.

The benefits of this combination are: (1) It can make use of the agricultural slack time without surplus labor. (2) It can also absorb semi-laborers to participate in labor, with full laborers engaging in transportation and marketing production. Its disadvantages are: (1) It may lose money if it is not done well. (2) Sometimes it is difficult to find profitable transportation and marketing production when idle.

V. Contracting Method: Some small handicraft workers do not have enough land at home to maintain their livelihoods, but there is no one to do the production if they go out. In this way, they contract their land to others or mutual aid teams, paying a few dou of grain per mu, and the others or mutual aid teams are responsible for cultivating their land. The benefit of this is that on the one hand, people who do not have enough land to cultivate now have enough land to cultivate, and on the other hand, some small handicraft workers can earn more wages after going out, which is beneficial to both parties.

### 高平互助组的几种形式

　　高平互助组的几种形式
    高平县地少人多，平均一个人二亩半地，农业收入不够维持生活，剩余劳力是很多的。副业和手工业很发达，全年收入总额要超过农业，甚至大过几倍。各种技术工人很多，抗战前该县有三万工人，占全县廿八万人口的九分之一弱。就在这种情况下面，翻身农民适应当地条件，组织了各种形式的互助组：
    一、时工时农的互助组：五区很多村子差不多男人都会打钉子下煤窑，这种收入大过农业数倍，但是农民还有少许土地，为了工农兼顾，自动组织起来。某村互助七人，组成一个钉炉，共用一个火炉，雇一个人拉风箱，各人用各人的铁打个人的钉子，农忙了大家又在一起上地互助，计工还工，地里活作完再打钉子。
    二、工农业分工合作的互助组：三甲申进喜互助组由六家共九个人（全劳力六个，半劳力三个）组成，在今年正月间，他们集中了十六石小米，开办了一个货炉，请了一个经理一个会计两个技术工人，他们的互助组中有六个人有技术也参加了货炉工作，每人每天可赚五升米的工资。同时他们利用货炉早上或晚上的不作工时间（用火时早上不作工，做模型时下午不做工），即与互助的人一起下地做活。他们一天分十分，一天工资四升米，两个牲口连一个人作一晌地二斗半米，实行工票记工算帐。另外一方面货炉有什么工作，只要在农闲时，他们也尽可能叫他们本互助组的人去作，他们开办到割麦时，每股（一石粮食）分了四十两货，一两货可卖到七百元。
    这样结合的好处是，工农合作，劳资合作，农民有足够的地种，工人也安心工作，且闲时还可上地工作，双方生产，情绪很高，没有闲时。农民还可得到较高而现成的工资。
    三、农副业经常结合的办法：例如赵庄王道士互助组五个人，集中了几石粮食，他们每天不歇晌，就利用这个时间轮流推磨罗粉，然后再轮流出去换粉，他们一天可以推三斗到五斗粮食的粉，推一斗粮食赚一斤粉面，剩下的渣还可以喂猪。又例如丁璧韩九锁的互助组共五个人，其中有四个人每人集中了高粱和米一石八斗，又两千五百元算作一股，有一个人磨粉时他管罗粉，他出了一半股，人工顶半股，合起来五个人每人顶一股，其中有四家每家都有与其他人合伙的牛，有一家有一个驴，每天只用驴拉一清早磨，然后各家以牛还工，一个牛工顶三个清早的驴工。
    这样结合的好处是：（一）充分的利用了农闲时间，有的把歇晌时间也劳动起来。（二）除赚到红利外，并可喂猪积肥，增加农业产量。
    四、农业与运销分工合作的办法：郭庄韩松根、陈村原九保、口则赵东成的互助组即是如此，他们都是几个人结合起来，集中些资本、挑选一、二个做运销有经验的人，去搞运销工作，出去吃饭盘费归大家，然后以一工顶一工，在家里的人把他的地种上，在农闲时，有时大家集体的去搞，如韩松根的互助组到河阳杜村去扛粮食，回来很赚钱。
    这样结合的好处是：（一）可以利用农闲时间无剩余劳力。（二）并可吸收半劳力参加劳动，全劳力去搞运销生产。它的不好处是：（一）搞不好就要赔钱。（二）有时候闲起来找不到赚钱的运销生产。
    五、包工办法：有些小手工业者家里地不多，维持不住生活，但是出去生产地又无人做了，这样就把地包给了别人或互助组，每亩地他出几斗粮食的代价，别人或互助组即负责给他耕种田地，这样的好处一方面使地不够种的人地够种了，另一方面使一些小手工业者出去之后能赚到更多的工资，双方都有利。
