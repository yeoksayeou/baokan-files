[This article transmitted by] This Newspaper, Taiyue, 7th. On the morning of July 13th, the remnants of two companies from the 49th Regiment of the Chiang Kai-shek's 17th Brigade, breaking out from Xia County, were protecting the personnel of the puppet Xia County government as they fled through Nanbeishi Village towards Xiaqu. He, the director of the Xia County Military Committee, upon learning this, immediately led over sixty militiamen to eliminate these escaping enemies. The Chiang Kai-shek forces, with three times the manpower of the militia and equipped with heavy machine guns and other heavy weapons, also trained by American officers, were met by the sixty-odd militiamen, still wearing their peasant clothes and carrying rifles. However, the Chiang Kai-shek's two companies, upon being pursued, fled in panic towards the Mopan Ridge area, some even discarding their caps. Upon reaching Mopan Ridge, they were finally surrounded by the militia. The Chiang army officers, confident in their superior equipment, scoffed, "Not afraid, just some militiamen!" The battle began, with the enemy relying on their superior firepower to form a line. But the militia was determined: "Eliminate them if they don't surrender!" Thus, the battle gradually intensified. Bullets whizzed overhead, and the militia calmly threw hand grenades, black smoke billowing in the enemy ranks, and enemies fell. After a full hour of fighting, the enemy was thrown into chaos, and the militia seized the opportunity to charge, bayoneting two to death. Only then did the Chiang soldiers shout, "Surrender, surrender!" By the end of the battle, nine enemies were killed, seven wounded, and the ranks of prisoners included fifty-eight soldiers from the enemy's 49th Regiment and thirteen members of the local "Love the Village Corps." The militia seized one heavy machine gun, five light machine guns, fifty-seven rifles, four grenade launchers, six pistols, one radio, over a thousand rounds of ammunition, and a great deal of military supplies. The militia returned laden with spoils, grinning from ear to ear.

[This article transmitted by] This Newspaper, Taiyue, 6th. The militia of the Fourth District of Jiang County has made great contributions to protecting the masses' liberation. The militia of Dajiao Village and other villages, during Chiang Kai-shek's large-scale invasion last July, relocated to the mountains to persist in the struggle. Local landlords colluded with Chiang's army to carry out frantic "counter-settlements" against their families. After the recovery of the area this April, the Dajiao Village militia became the vanguard of the land reform movement in the village. On the 20th of last month, militiaman Zhang Chunmao led several people to Fen City, capturing the fugitive struggle targets Cao Fusheng, Cao Rulin, and Ge Youshun, the fugitive ringleader of the "counter-settlement" from Chengjing Village, and five others, greatly praised by the masses. Every family prepared food to comfort them, and the county headquarters immediately commended them and called on the militia of the entire district to learn from them and protect the liberation struggle. This time, the Changzhenglin Village militia also repelled the invasion of Hao Faliang and other remnants of Chen Ziwenz's forces, and contacted the militia of Nanbeipo and Jilu Yu villages to take the initiative to clear out the bandits' nest in Dashangu. On the 20th of last month, they completely routed the bandits, capturing the puppet police captain Hao Faliang and four others, seizing four rifles, two sabers, seven bombs, over a hundred rounds of ammunition, and other property. From then on, the threat of bandits to the mass movements in the Third and Fourth Districts was eliminated. In addition to issuing a circular of commendation, the county headquarters awarded each of the aforementioned village militias a major merit.

    追歼夏县逃敌
    民兵以少胜多
    【本报太岳七日电】七月十三日清晨，从夏县突围出来的蒋嫡系十七旅四十九团残部两个连，保护着夏县伪县政府人员，经南北师村，向下曲方向逃窜，夏县武委会何主任得悉立即带领六十多个民兵，要消灭这伙逃网的敌人。蒋记的两个连，不仅有民兵三倍以上的兵力，而且携带有重机枪等重火器，又受过美国军官的训练，而这六十多个民兵，仍旧穿着原来老百姓衣服，扛的是步枪，可是蒋记的两个连，一被追击，赶快向磨盘岭一带仓惶逃窜，有的甚至把大盖帽也抛了。追到磨盘岭，终于被民兵包围住了。素来凭自己有精良装备的蒋军军官，还不知厉害，竟说：“不怕、几个民兵！”战斗开始了，敌人倚仗自己优势的火力，摆开了阵势，可是民兵决心：“不投降就消灭它。”于是战斗逐渐激烈起来，子弹在双方头顶上飞叫，民兵很沉着的投过手榴弹去，一缕一缕黑烟，在敌人群中冒起来，敌人倒下去了，整整打了一个钟头，敌人混乱了，民兵乘势冲杀过去，用刺刀通死两个，这时蒋军才叫喊着：“缴枪、缴枪”。结束战斗时，毙敌九名，伤敌七名，俘虏的行列里，是敌四十九团的五十八个士兵，十三个爱乡团。缴获重机枪一挺，轻机枪五挺，步枪五十七支，掷弹筒四个，手枪六支，无线电台一部，子弹千余发，和很多军用品。民兵笑嘻嘻的满载而归。
    【本报太岳六日电】绛县四区民兵，保卫群众翻身立大功。大交等村民兵，在去年七月蒋军大举进犯时转移到山地坚持斗争。当地地主便勾结蒋军向其家属进行疯狂的“倒算”。今年四月，该区收复后，大交村民兵，成为村里土改运动的先锋。上月二十日民兵张春茂带领数人，奔击汾城，捉拿逃亡斗争对象曹福生、曹如林及程景村逃亡之“倒算”祸首葛有顺等五人，甚为群众赞扬，家家备饭慰劳，县指挥部立即表扬和号召全区民兵，向其学习，保卫翻身斗争。此次长征岭村民兵，亦打退了陈逆子文残部郝发亮等进犯，而且联络南北坡及继鲁峪各村民兵，主动向土匪窝大山谷清剿。上月二十日，将该匪全部击溃。俘伪警察大队长郝发亮等五名，缴获步枪四支，指挥刀两把，炸弹七颗，子弹百余发，及其他财物一部。从此解除了土匪对三、四区群运的威胁。县指挥部除通报表扬外，并给上述各村民兵各记一大功。
