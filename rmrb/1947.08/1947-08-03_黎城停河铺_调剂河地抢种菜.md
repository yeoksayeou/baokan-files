Licheng Tinghepu

Adjusting River Land to Rush Plant Vegetables

[This newspaper's Licheng report] The masses in Tinghepu, based on their own personal experience, are overcoming the famine entirely through active production. Because of the drought and lack of rain, planting vegetables in dry land is impossible. Some households have no river land, while others have river land but lack the labor to cultivate it. People like Wang Naisheng and Cao Wenxian said, "We want to plant some vegetables, but we don't have any land (referring to river land)." Old man Liu Shengfa, who lacks labor, and veteran Du Honglu said, "We have land, but we lack the labor to manage it." Therefore, they organized mutual adjustments. Wang Lianxing's labor hero team adjusted out 2.8 mu of wheat land, providing Cao Zhangxian and 17 other households with land to plant vegetables. Du Honglu's team adjusted out 5 mu of wheat land, allowing eight households to plant vegetables, and they also dug a new well on the land. The method is that the households planting the land will pay the land-owning household based on the actual grain yield next summer, and the burden (of taxes and levies) will still be borne by the land-owning household. If no wheat is harvested next summer, the vegetable-planting households will make up for this year's burden. After discussion, the masses unanimously agreed that there are four benefits to adjustment: (1) Those without river land can also plant vegetables to overcome the famine, planting one crop this year and another next spring. (2) It solves the difficulties of poor military dependents and households lacking labor, allowing them to obtain wheat without working. (3) Wheat land is adjusted and returned in the autumn, yielding two crops a year. (4) Digging more wells can alleviate future emergencies, a one-time investment with lasting benefits, and everyone feels it is beneficial. The entire village adjusted out 10.3 mu of wheat land, allowing 37 households to plant vegetables and overcome the famine; four new wells were dug, and including their own land, a total of 57.5 mu of vegetable land was cultivated. Twelve new wells have already been dug, and there are plans to dig ten more. (Changqun, Shouxian, Ruiwen)

[This newspaper's Licheng report] On July 26th, Nanbu Village in the Second District received two fingers of rain, enough for vegetable seeds to sprout. The leadership seized this opportunity and called on everyone to simultaneously water the seedlings and transplant them, rushing to plant autumn vegetables to make up for the losses. The entire village, except for those watering the seedlings, participated in this replanting campaign. After completing the individual replanting for his team on the morning of the 27th, labor hero He Kaoxian led the 37 laborers of his team to the mountains in the afternoon to plow mature wasteland and sow autumn vegetables. Their slogan is: "Plant autumn vegetables, save grain, overcome disaster and defeat Chiang Kai-shek!" They are very confident, saying: "Radishes in early fu, vegetables in mid-fu, buckwheat in late fu comes quickly." They planted 20 mu in one night. (Yongqin, Yucheng, Faming)

    调剂河地抢种菜
    【本报黎城讯】停河铺群众，根据自己的亲身经验，渡荒全凭积极生产，种菜因为天旱没雨，＠地出不来，有的户儿没河地，有的有河地缺劳力种不上，如王乃生、曹文贤等说：“咱想种些菜，就是没有地（指河地）。”无劳力老汉刘生法、退伍军人杜鸿禄等说：“咱是有地没劳力顾不上。”所以组织了互相调剂，劳英王连星队四户调剂出麦地二亩八分，曹丈贤等十七户有了种菜地。张合狗队的杜鸿禄一户就调剂出五亩麦地，八户种上了菜，并在地内新打井一眼。办法是种地户付出地主家明年夏天实打产粮，负担仍由主家出。要是明夏不收麦，种菜户补出今年负担。经过群众讨论一致认为调剂好处有四：（一）没河地也能种菜渡荒，今年种一季明春还能种一季。（二）解决了贫苦军属没劳力户困难，不劳动也能得麦。（三）麦地调还成秋，一年得两季。（四）多打井能救将来急，一本万年利，人人感到有利。全村八户调剂出麦地十亩三分，三十七户种菜能渡荒；增加新打井四眼，连同自己地，共种菜地五十七亩半。已打新井十二眼，计划再打十眼。（长群、守贤、锐文）
    【本报黎城讯】二区南堡村七月廿六日下了二指来雨，撒菜能够出来，领导上抓住这个机会，便号召大家一面浇苗，一面安苗，抢种秋菜，补起窟窿。全村除浇苗的人外，都卷入这个补种运动中。劳英何考贤于二十七日上午完成他队的个人补种后，即领导他队的三十七个劳力于下午上山刨熟荒撒秋菜。他们的口号是：“种下秋菜省下粮，能渡灾荒打老蒋”。他们很有信心说：“头伏萝卜二伏菜，三伏荞麦来的快。”一晚即种了二十亩。（永芹、玉成、发明）
