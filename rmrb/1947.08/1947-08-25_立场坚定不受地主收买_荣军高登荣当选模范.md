　　Firmly Standing His Ground and Not Bought Off by Landlords
  　Honored Soldier Gao Dengrong Elected as a Role Model
    [This newspaper's report from Jilu豫, August 23rd] Gao Dengrong, an honored soldier from the Fifth District of Kunwu County, was elected as an A-grade model honored soldier in the entire county due to his firm stance and active work. Gao Dengrong originally served as a soldier in a certain unit. After being wounded and disabled, he returned home and soon became the model militia squad leader of Gao Village. During the land reform, he worked very actively. The landlord Gao Yuyao cut five catties of pork and secretly delivered it to his house at night, saying to his wife, "Second Sister-in-law, I bought some meat at the market. You eat it first and then tell Dengrong." When Gao Dengrong returned home, he saw the meat and asked, "We are so poor that we can't even afford salt. Where did this meat come from?" His wife, unable to hide it, said that it was given by the landlord. Gao Dengrong was extremely angry and threw the meat into the toilet. His cousin Gao Yulin was suspected of being a special agent. He led the masses to speak out about their grievances and personally interrogated the landlords and special agents Gao Yuyao, Gao Yulin, Liu Lancai, and Xu Yangguang. When conscripting soldiers, he led eighty-four young adults to join the army. After arriving at the replenishment regiment, he was streamlined and returned home due to disability. After returning, he continued to work loyally and actively. This spirit of resolutely serving the people has become a model for honored soldiers in Kunwu County and he was elected as a model honored soldier in the entire county.

　　立场坚定不受地主收买
  　荣军高登荣当选模范
    【本报冀鲁豫二十三日电】昆吾县五区荣誉军人高登荣，立场坚定工作积极，被选为全县荣誉军人甲等模范。高登荣原在某部当战士，负伤后因残废回家，不久即任高庄民兵模范班长，土改时工作非常积极。地主高玉耀割了五斤猪肉，黑夜偷送他家，对他老婆说：“二嫂子，我上集买了点肉，您先吃了再对登荣说。”高登荣回家看到了肉问：“咱穷的连盐都买不起，那来的肉！？”他妻看隐瞒不过，才说是地主送的，高登荣愤恨异常，把肉抛到厕所里。他堂亲高玉林，有特务嫌疑，他领着群众诉苦，亲自审讯高玉耀、高玉林、刘兰彩、许仰光等地主特务。参军时，他又带领八十四名青壮年参军；到补充团后，又因残废被精简回家，回来后仍忠诚积极的工作。这种坚决为人民服务的精神，成为昆吾全县荣誉军人的榜样，被选为全县荣誉军人的模范。
