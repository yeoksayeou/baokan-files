Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, August 20th. The All-China Students' Federation has issued a declaration regarding Wedemeyer's mission to China. According to a TASS report from Shanghai on the 19th, the declaration reads as follows: "Since President Truman issued his statement on China policy in 1945, the US government has repeatedly stated that they will abide by their promise to respect China's independence. However, the undeniable fact is that the (Chiang) government has been drawn into a large-scale civil war with US military and economic assistance. We must issue a serious warning to the US government: the weapons and ammunition you have provided to the (Chiang) government are being used to slaughter the Chinese people at every moment. Professors Li Gongpu and Wen Yiduo, leaders of the China Democratic League, were killed by American silenced pistols, and three graduates of Wuhan University were killed by American-made dumdum bullets during the patriotic and democratic movement against hunger, civil war, and oppression in May of this year. Every Chinese person has learned from their own experience that the US policy towards China completely violates the wishes and interests of the Chinese people. It is a colonial and aggressive policy of an imperialist country. Therefore, we, the people of the whole country, oppose now and will continue to resolutely oppose this American policy of interference and its support for and expansion of the Chinese civil war in military and economic terms under various pretexts. We demand the immediate cancellation of the general mobilization order and an end to the civil war and dictatorial policies. We oppose conscription of soldiers, grain, and taxes to expand the civil war. We demand that pressing domestic problems be resolved in accordance with the resolutions of the Political Consultative Conference, that retaliatory actions against the people and people's movements be stopped, that arrested students and other patriotic citizens be released, that orders dismissing professors and expelling students be abolished, and that human rights and basic freedoms such as freedom of speech, publication, assembly, and association be effectively guaranteed. We demand the immediate abolition of one-party dictatorship and the autocracy of the so-called "multi-party government" under one-party protection. We demand the establishment of a truly democratic coalition government including representatives of all parties and all classes. We oppose the (Chiang) government's implementation of a starvation policy, oppose the monopoly of the market by large family capital, the plundering of national trade and industry, and oppose the resumption of trade with Japan. We demand freedom of education and lecturing, and guarantees for students' right to study and teachers' right to live. Education funding should be increased, and party-based education and ideological control must be abolished."

　　全国学联发表宣言抗议美国侵华政策
    【新华社陕北二十日电】全国学生联合会顷就魏德迈来华使命发表宣言，据塔斯社沪十九日电，宣言内容如下：“自一九四五年杜鲁门总统发表对华政策声明以来，美国政府曾不断反复申述他们将遵守诺言尊重中国的独立。但无可否认的事实是：（蒋）政府已经以美国的军事与经济援助卷入大规模内战的漩涡。我们必须向美国政府提出严重警告：你们所给予（蒋）政府的武器和弹药，已经时时刻刻用于屠杀中国人民。中国民主同盟领袖李公朴、闻一多两教授是美国无声手枪打死的，而三个武汉大学毕业生在今年五月间反饥饿、反内战、反压迫的爱国民主运动中，也是被美制达姆弹打死的。每一个中国人都从自己的经验中认识到美国对华政策，完全违反中国人民的愿望与利益，这是一种帝国主义国家的殖民地与侵略政策。因此，我们全国人民现在反对并将继续坚决反对美国的这种干涉政策，及其以各种借口在军事与经济方面支持并扩大中国内战。我们要求立即取消总动员令，终止内战与独裁政策，我们反对征兵征粮征税扩延内战。我们要求遵照政协决议解决迫切的国内问题，停止对人民及人民运动的报复行动，释放被捕学生及其他爱国公民，废除解聘教授及黜退学生的命令，切实保障人权与言论、出版、集会、结社等基本自由。我们要求立即废除一党独裁与一党卵翼下的所谓“多党政府”的专制，我们要求成立包括各党派及各阶层代表的真正民主联合政府。我们反对（蒋）政府实行饥饿政策，反对大家族资本垄断市场，掠夺国家贸易与工业，反对恢复对日贸易。我们要求教育与讲学自由，及学生求学权利与教员生存权利的保证。教育经费应予提高，而党化教育与思想统制必须废除。”
