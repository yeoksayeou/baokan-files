    Fully Organize Crash Planting and Weeding
    Rain has fallen universally throughout the region, and even the counties and districts that have toiled bitterly since spring have been thoroughly soaked. This is a joyous event, and the masses are jubilant, launching a crash planting and weeding campaign. After a long drought, the masses' confidence in overcoming the disaster has soared. Organizing crash planting and weeding is the current pressing demand. At this moment, the leadership should adapt to this demand of the masses, concentrate its strength to go deep among the masses, further encourage their enthusiasm, and organize and assist in carrying out this work in a concentrated manner. All work that does not adapt to this demand, all meetings that do not adapt to this demand, even if they have been arranged or are even in progress, can be temporarily suspended, and all energy can be devoted to this task.
    The Beginning of Autumn is approaching, and the season waits for no one. The timing for crash planting and weeding is extremely short and urgent. Crash planting and replanting of late autumn crops such as millet, mung beans, and buckwheat can still be done in some places if grasped tightly. Radishes, turnips, and other autumn vegetables should be planted extensively and universally. In many counties in southern Hebei, attention should be paid to eliminating bare land. Before the rain, an urgent call was issued, concentrating all forces to rush plant vegetables and buckwheat, with plans formulated according to people and households, requiring each person to plant two to three fen of wasteland to ensure three mu of seedlings. In the Taihang Mountains, in the movement to overcome drought and hail disasters, the mass movement of replanting late autumn crops has been created, recognizing that planting one mu of vegetables is equivalent to two mu of grain, striving to plant as much as possible. These should be developed in a more organized manner. On the other hand, seedlings grow quickly after rain, and the proliferation of weeds must also be noted. If weeding is not seized tightly, both weed-infested seedlings and reduced harvests are possible. In drought-stricken areas, sowing is uneven, and weeding and crash planting may be intertwined, so efforts should be made to promote both crash planting and weeding without neglecting either.
    The key to the success of this work lies in organizing manpower. Attention should be paid to organizing both full and semi-labor forces to participate in this movement. In some new areas, because the mass mutual aid movement has just been launched, some are forcibly organized, and some lack experience in calculating work points. It has already been shown that mutual aid cannot continue. In order to ensure that crash planting and weeding are done well, it is hoped that all localities will seize the development and organization of mutual aid, and further develop and improve the mutual aid movement.

    全力组织抢种抢锄
    全区普遍降雨，自春苦干至今的若干县区也都下透，这是一件可喜的大事，群情欢腾，抢种抢锄运动正开展中。久旱逢雨，所有群众战胜旱灾的信心空前高涨，组织起来抢种抢锄是目前的迫切要求，这时领导上应适应群众这一要求，集中力量深入群众，更加鼓舞他们的情绪，组织与帮助突击进行这一工作。一切不适应这一要求的工作，不适应这一要求的集会，那怕已经布置，甚或正在进行，都可暂时停止，把全部精力投到这一任务中去。
    立秋将至，节令不容人，抢种抢锄的时机已极短促与急迫。抢种与补种晚秋，如糜黍、绿豆、荞麦有些地方如抓得紧还可赶得上种，萝卜、蔓菁等秋菜应大量普遍的多种，冀南不少县份，注意消灭白地，在雨前即发出紧急号召，集中一切力量抢种蔬菜和荞麦，按人按家订计划，每人必须种二三分荒，保证有三亩苗，太行群众在战胜旱、雹灾的运动中，抢补晚秋已造成群众性运动，认识到种一亩菜可顶二亩粮，尽可能争取多种采，这些都应更有组织的发展起来。另外一方面，小苗得雨，长得很快，而杂草丛生也须注意，如不抓紧抢锄，荒苗与减少收成都有可能。在受旱地区下种参差不齐，锄苗与抢种还可能挤在一块，应大力发扬抢种抢锄两不误。
    这一工作完成的好坏，决定关键在于把人力组织起来，应注意组织全半劳力都投入到这一运动中去。有一部分新区，因群众互助运动刚在发动，有些是强迫编制，有些还缺乏计工折工的经验，已经表现互助不下去，为使抢种抢锄搞得好，希各地都能抓紧发展与组织互助，把互助运动向前发展再提高一步。
