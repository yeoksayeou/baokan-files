[This report from our correspondent in Shahe] After hoeing the seedlings three times, the masses in Dukou Village formulated a plan for meritorious service in the month before the autumn harvest. The plan includes hoeing the 2,136 mu of dry land that have not been hoed for the fourth time (some even for the fifth time) within four days; harvesting 210 mu of indigo within twenty days. Another 158 mu will be planted with turnips in the indigo, millet, and melon fields, planting large ridges without delaying wheat planting. In addition to the coal-burning households, the remaining labor force will gather more than 153,000 jin of firewood to prepare for autumn. They will also repair 96 mu of riverbank ground. The four groups, in addition to transporting and guaranteeing the supply of coal for autumn burning, will earn an additional 94,000 yuan. After harvesting the indigo, the village will increase the number of livestock by fifteen head and will also take advantage of the slack season to plant 15,000 seedlings. After the plan was made, each group immediately began to act. Because it rained and they could not hoe the ground, they all went out to repair the riverbank (now the ground is being built, and early siltation can still catch up with vegetable planting). On the afternoon of the 13th, as soon as the rain stopped, fifteen laborers from the eighth group went down to the riverbank. After three days of rain, the village has built more than 100 mu of river ground. The fifth and sixth groups, which had fallen behind last time, joined together this time to repair a piece of stony ground that had been silted three feet deep in the east of the village. More than a dozen laborers repaired two fen in half a day, seeing the good floor underneath, their enthusiasm was even greater, and they guaranteed to repair two mu to catch up with vegetable planting. Now, each group is actively working to realize the plan. (Yizhu, Yanming, Kuilin)

[Reported by our Correspondent Team on the 20th] Farmers in the Xintai New District are actively making fertilizer to prepare for wheat planting. When the Kongcun mutual aid group discussed the ten-day production plan, it was decided to concentrate the greatest effort on making fertilizer. After the meeting, village cadres and heads of mutual aid groups immediately led the work and challenged each other to become fertilizer-making models. The Guo Jinhao group in Dajia Township plans to compost 1,000 dan of green fertilizer within three days. Farmers in Beizhao Village are trying every means to accumulate fertilizer, using methods such as "winning the manure pit," "repairing the manure pit," and "replacing the old stove with a new one" to launch a fertilizer-making campaign. Baishan Village plans for each laborer to be responsible for preparing fertilizer for two mu of land. Farmers in Nanhui Village have each set a goal of making 15 dan of fertilizer and guaranteeing rapid completion. The mutual aid group led by Zhao Jing, the village chief of Zhaojiatun Village, has already made seven large circles of green fertilizer, enough for fifteen mu of land. Using the example of his group's fertilizer making, he used accounting methods to mobilize the thinking of the village's farmers, saying: "These seven circles of manure can be applied to fifteen mu of land. Buying manure would cost at least 3,000 yuan per mu, saving 45,000 yuan at once." Now, all the farmers in the village are collecting green grass and other waste to compost fertilizer. Each mutual aid group in Xinxingguan Village has opened two large new manure pools. When work began, the farmers jokingly said to each other: "Dig quickly! This is to build a treasure basin!"

[This report] After the seedlings in the villages of the Xintai Li Maji point were hoed twice, the masses felt a sense of relief about the farm work, thinking that the crop work had been completed. At this time, the leadership proposed: "Hoe the ground again." A few farmers who were active in farm work were pulling manure to the seedling fields to apply topdressing, saying: "Rather let the land not be idle than the manure be idle," "Seize the green seedlings and manure for a two-season harvest," "Store grain rather than manure." However, most of the masses reflected: manure should be applied to vegetable plots, a little should be accumulated to plant wheat, and in dry weather, applying topdressing would burn the seedlings. The leadership promptly mobilized again. Wang Zenglin, the head of the Beizhao mutual aid group, said: "Guarantee that each member of the group will apply all the manure to the land," and put forward the slogan: "Even a handful of manure must be applied to the land." "The manure pit is empty, the latrine is empty, the stove must be replaced with a new surface." Cadres in Nangao Village proposed: cadres should take the lead and guarantee completion in three days. According to statistics from Beizhao Village: 70 large carts of topdressing were applied, 84 mu of land were fertilized, 500 dan of night soil were carried, and 38.5 mu of land were fertilized, totaling 128.5 mu of seedlings that were topdressed.

  　苗锄四遍，添种蔓菁；剩余劳力，打柴修滩。
　　渡口竞赛秋前立功
    【本报沙河讯】渡口村群众于锄完三遍苗后，订出了秋收前一个月的立功计划。计全村没锄第四遍的旱地二千一百三十六亩（有的是第五遍），四天锄完；二百一十亩靛二十天内打完。靛、小谷、瓜地，再种蔓菁菜一百五十八亩，种成大垄不误种麦。剩余劳力除了烧煤户以外，打柴十五万三千多斤，准备过秋天的烧柴。修河滩场子九十六亩。四个组除运输保证供给秋天烧煤外，再赚钱九万四千元。全村在打靛以后，增加牲口十五头，并趁伏天，下秧苗圃一万五千棵。计划后各组立即行动起来，因为下雨不能锄地，就一齐出动，修理河滩（现在垒好场子，淤的早还能赶上种菜）。十三日午后，天刚住雨，第八组十五个劳力就下了河滩。下雨三天，全村垒起河场已超过了一百亩。第五、六两组上次落了后，这次联合起来去村东修理淤了三尺厚的一块石子地。十几个劳力，两半天内就修成了二分，见了底下的好地板子，劲儿更大了，保证修出二亩来赶上种菜。现各组都在积极的为实现计划而努力。（一柱、彦明、奎林）
    【本报记者团二十日电】邢台新区农民，积极造肥，准备种麦。孔村互助组，讨论十天的生产计划时，确定以最大力量造肥，会后村干部与各互助组长，立即带领着干，并互相挑战，争取造肥模范。大贾乡郭进豪组，准备在三天内沤青肥一千担。北召马农民想尽一切办法积肥以“胜粪坑”，“修粪坑”“老炕换新的”等方法，掀起造肥运动。柏山村计划每个劳动力负责准备二亩地的肥料。南会村农民每人自订造肥十五担，并保证迅速完成。赵家屯村长赵景领导下的互助组，现已造青肥七大圈，能上十五亩地。他以本组造肥为例，用算帐方法，打全村农民的思想，他说：“我们这七圈粪，能上十五亩地，买粪每亩至少三千元，一下就节约了四万五千元。”现全村农民都在收割青草等废物沤肥。新兴馆村每个互助组开了两个很大的新粪池，动工时农民互相开玩笑的说：“快掘！这是修聚宝盆！”
    【本报讯】邢台李马基点各村苗锄过二遍后，群众对农活松了一口气，认为庄稼活已交工，这时领导上提出：“地再锄一遍”，对农活积极的少数农民，往苗地里拉粪上追肥，并说：“能叫地闲，不叫粪闲”，“抓青苗粪两季收”，“能存粮不存粪”。但大部群众反映：有粪还上菜地，积一点还种麦子，天旱，上追肥烧毁苗等。领导上抓紧又作动员。北召马互助组长王增林说：保证每个组员将所有的粪上到地里，提出口号：有一把粪也要往地上。“粪坑光，茅房光，炕要换新面”。南高村干部提出：干部要带头，保证三天完成。北召马村统计：上追粪七十大车，抓地八十四亩，担大圊五百担，上地三十八亩半，共一百二十八亩半苗，上到追肥。（发家之道）
