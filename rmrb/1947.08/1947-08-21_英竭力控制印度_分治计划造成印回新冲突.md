Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 17th: Moscow Dispatch: Red Star newspaper recently published a commentary on the British partition plan for India, stating that the Second World War severely deteriorated Britain's economic and strategic position, and American economic power pushed Britain out of the Far East and Near East. The purpose of the British partition plan for India is to try to hold on to its position in India. At present, India's economic lifeline (such as highways, ships, ports, irrigation, finance, most jute industry, and all mining) is still in the hands of Britain. Britain artificially separates industrial areas from agricultural areas, thus continuing the economic relationship of "industrial Britain, agricultural India," and Britain controls Indian politics through pro-British capitalists, landlords, and merchants in East India. The newspaper continued: The partition plan has created new conflicts between India and Pakistan; and the actual power of the reactionary feudal princes has not been damaged by any of the new plan. The newspaper concluded: The British partition plan for India will inevitably further weaken Indian politics and economy.

Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 17th: Various sources report: After the partition of India, Britain still attempts to control the Indian armed forces. Indian public opinion is deeply dissatisfied with this and has criticized it. The Indian News Chronicle commented that the British military authorities have successfully convinced the Indian government that if British officers leave, the Indian army will "lose its combat effectiveness." At present, most British officers will participate in the Indian army as "volunteers." To date, sixteen British major generals and two hundred and sixty brigadier generals have remained in the Indian army. The newspaper continued: This move by Britain will indefinitely delay the establishment of a truly Indian armed force. In other words, control of the Indian army will still be in the hands of Britain. The People's Century newspaper condemned Britain for dividing the Indian army based on different religious beliefs, plotting to establish two hostile camps that rely on British support. According to a French News Agency dispatch from London on the 9th, in accordance with the agreement signed between Britain and the Kingdom of Hindustan and Nepal, eight regiments of Gurkha troops will continue to be under British control.

Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 17th: Delhi Dispatch: The 15th of this month was the anniversary of the partition of India. Hindustan held an "Independence Movement Week" to commemorate it, and Pakistan also held meetings to celebrate. However, amidst the celebratory firecrackers, the sound of gunfire from Indian-Pakistani conflicts continues unabated. Since the Punjab Boundary Commission began its work on the 21st of last month, the bloodshed in Calcutta, Punjab, Kashmir, and other places has intensified. In the massacres of Indians, Pakistanis, and Sikhs in various places, more than 500 people have died.

　　英竭力控制印度
  　分治计划造成印回新冲突
    【新华社陕北十七日电】莫斯科讯：红星报顷著论评述英国分治印度计划称：二次世界大战使英国经济及战略地位极端恶化，美国经济力量把英国从远东和近东排挤出去。英国分治印度计划，其目的就是要竭力守住它在印度的地位。目前印度的经济命脉（如公路、船舶、港口、灌溉、财政、大部分苎麻工业及全部矿业）仍操在英国手里。英国用人为方法把工业区与农业区分离，因而使“工业英国，农业印度”的经济主从关系继续下去，英国并通过东印度的亲英资本家、地主、商人控制印度政治。该报继称：分治计划已造成了印回间的新的冲突；而反动的封建王公既有之实权，并未受新计划之任何损害。该报结语称：英国分治印度计划将不可避免地使印度政治与经济更形衰弱。
    【新华社陕北十七日电】各方讯：印度分治后，英国仍图控制印度武装，印度舆论对此深表不满并纷予抨击。印度新闻纪事报评称：英国军事当局已成功地说服了印度政府，使他们相信假若英国军官离开了，印军将“丧失其战斗力”。目前大多数英国军官将作为“志愿军”参加印军。迄今已有十六名英国少将及二六○名准将留在印军中供职。该报续称：英国此举将使真正印度武装之建立无限期延宕。换言之，印军的控制权将仍然掌握在英国手里。人民世纪报痛斥英国以宗教信仰不同原则分裂印军，蓄谋建立两个敌对而又依赖于英国支持的阵营。另据法新闻处伦敦九日电，依照英国与印度斯坦及尼泊尔王国所签订之协定，廓尔喀族兵团的八个团将继续置于英国控制下。
    【新华社陕北十七日电】德里讯：本月十五日为印度分治纪念日，印度斯坦举行“独立运动周”以示纪念，巴基斯坦亦开会庆祝。但在爆竹祝贺声中，印回冲突之枪声仍不绝于耳。自上月二十一日旁遮普划界委员会开始工作以来，加尔各答、旁遮普、克什密尔等地之血案即愈演愈烈。各地印、回、锡克三族残杀案中，死亡群众达五百余名。
