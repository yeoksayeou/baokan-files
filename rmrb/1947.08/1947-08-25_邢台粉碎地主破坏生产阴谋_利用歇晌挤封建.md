[By our reporters on the 23rd] In many villages in Xingtai, feudalism is being squeezed out during production, striking at the landlords' conspiracy to sabotage production. In Dongbaishan, the landlord Guo Tianzhen sabotaged the masses' drought resistance, promoting the carrying of the Dragon God. When the masses reclaimed wasteland, he sabotaged it by saying, "Working on the slopes is not as good as working on the plains!" Some farmers with poor awareness were affected by him. The mutual aid group he joined lagged behind in wasteland reclamation. When the landlord Guo Tianzhong cultivated land for military families, he deliberately left a foot-wide strip of land un-hoed along the edge of the field; the landlord Wen Xingjian in Xibaishan harrowed the land for military families, turning over the seedlings. When someone asked, "Why are you deliberately messing things up?" he said, "I don't know how." Some landlords hoed the land for others, hoeing a bit and then covering it up. The landlord in Pangma Village spread rumors in the mutual aid group to sabotage production, saying, "The more you save, the more the Eighth Route Army will demand!" When repairing waterways, the landlord spread rumors, "If you repair the waterways, you will have to pay more public grain." When the leadership called on farmers to become rich, they spread rumors again: "If you become rich, you will be struggled against again!" After the land reform, many landlords joined mutual aid groups and cooperatives, some appearing active but secretly sabotaging. The masses saw through their conspiracies and were extremely resentful, saying, "Landlords won't give up until they see the Yellow River," "Landlords are like donkeys; they won't cross the river without a whip!" So, they used break times to launch a campaign to squeeze out feudalism again, removing most of the landlords from the mutual aid groups and cooperatives, and saying, "If you don't change, we won't even lend you farming tools." In this feudal-squeezing campaign, Pangma Village unearthed three shih and six dou of wheat, forty catties of cotton, more than seventy quilts and clothes, and two head of livestock. (Zhu Bo)
[From our correspondent in Taiyue, 22nd] After breaking through the cadres' "air raid shelters," the review movement in Anze has penetrated into the mutual aid groups. The mutual aid group in Beikongtan Village works during the day and searches for feudal remnants at night. From the conversations of people who never speak up, it was discovered that the struggle against the local tyrant Zhang Yulan in the past was a sham struggle. One farmer said, "I still paid rent to Zhang Yulan last year." In Tang Village, the landlord Li Tianlu was purged from the mutual aid group, and the old dyer Wang Jingyi, who never spoke up, exposed his "air raid shelter," resulting in the excavation of 110 shih of grain and 120,000 yuan in silver. Mutual aid groups in various villages in the Second District are producing while preparing to investigate feudalism. Participants in the war also discuss how to turn themselves over completely on the road.

　　邢台粉碎地主破坏生产阴谋
  　利用歇晌挤封建
    【本报记者团二十三日电】邢台许多村庄，生产中挤封建，打击地主破坏生产阴谋。东柏山地主郭天贞破坏群众防旱荒，活动农民抬龙神。群众开荒时他又破坏说：“坡地干活怎么也不如在平地！”若干觉悟较差的农民，受其影响。他参加的那个互助组，在开荒中落了后。地主郭天忠给军属代耕时，故意在地边留一尺多宽不锄；西柏山地主文兴俭，给军属耙地，将苗耙翻了，当别人追问：“你为什么故意捣乱？”他说：“不会闹。”还有些地主给别人锄地时，锄一锄盖一锄。庞马村地主在互助组中多方造谣破坏生产说：“节约了，八路军越发要的多！”修水地时，地主造谣说：“修成水地就得多出公粮”。领导上号召农民发家致富，他们又散布谣言：“发家致富，过富了又要斗争哩！”土地改革后，许多地主加入互助组、合作社，有的表面积极，暗中破坏。群众识破奸计愤恨异常，都说：“地主是不到黄河不死心”，“地主活像驴，不挨鞭子不过河！”于是利用歇晌时间，又掀起挤封建运动，将大部分地主从互助组合作社中清除出去，并说：“再不转变，连种地的家具也不借他们用”。庞马村在这次挤封建中，又搞出三石六斗麦子、四十斤棉花、被子衣服七十余件、牲口两头。（朱波）
    【本报太岳二十二日电】安泽复查运动于突破干部“防空洞”后，已深入到互助组中。北孔滩村互助组白天做活，黑夜找寻封建尾巴。从不吭气人的谈话中，发现过去对恶霸张玉兰所进行的是假斗争，有个农民说：“我去年还给张玉兰出了租子。”唐村则从互助组中清洗了地主栗天禄，从来不吭气的老染匠王敬义暴露了他的“防空洞”，结果刨出粮食一百一十石，大洋十二万元。二区各村互助组均一面生产，一面酝让查封建。参战人员在路上也讨论如何翻透身。
