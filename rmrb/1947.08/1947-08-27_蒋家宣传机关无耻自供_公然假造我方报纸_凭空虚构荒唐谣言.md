　　Jiang's Propaganda Machine Shamelessly Confesses
  　Openly Forging Our Newspapers
  　Fabricating Absurd Rumors Out of Thin Air
    Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, August 24th. During the Democratic Allied Forces' recovery of Changtu in the summer offensive, a secret document, the "Pacification Propaganda Handbook," printed by the Kuomintang's Ministry of National Defense News Bureau, was seized. The book, printed in a 64mo format, is divided into three parts: upper, middle, and lower. The sixth article of the "Implementation Methods" of propaganda "excerpted" in the lower part, "Disintegrating the Bandit Army" (referring to the People's Liberation Army), openly states: "Forge Xinhua Daily, Liberation Daily, or fabricate appointment certificates, fake telegrams, and fake letters to alienate their military's morale." The upper part contains Jiang's instructions, research and "methods" for "suppressing bandits." The Jiang gang's propaganda organs at all levels and the notorious Central News Agency's rumor-mongering base are now fully exposed.
    Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, August 24th. The notorious rumor company, Jiang's Central News Agency, recently reported in its Changchun dispatch that the North Manchurian authorities had ordered the cancellation of the Chinese national flag, replacing it with the Soviet flag, and that Harbin's Xinhua News Agency had broadcast this order via radio on August 1st. This agency solemnly declares that this news from the Central News Agency is a shameless fabrication from start to finish, a complete fabrication out of thin air.

　　蒋家宣传机关无耻自供
  　公然假造我方报纸
  　凭空虚构荒唐谣言
    【新华社陕北二十四日电】民主联军于夏季攻势收复昌图战役中，曾缴获蒋记国防部新闻局印发之秘件“绥靖宣传手册”，该书为铅印六十四开本，分上中下三篇，其下篇“摘录”宣传的“实施方法”中“瓦解匪军”（按指人民解放军）的第六条公然写着要：“假造新华日报、解放日报或伪制委任状、伪电报、伪信件离间其军心”，上篇即为蒋贼关于“剿匪”宣传“方法”“训示”“研究”。蒋记各级宣传机关及臭名远扬的中央社造谣底版，从此大白。
    【新华社陕北二十四日电】著名谣言公司蒋记中央社日前于其长春电讯中报道称：北满当局下令取消中国国旗，改悬苏联国旗，并为八月一日哈尔滨新华社曾用无线电广播此项命令云云。本社特严正声明，中央社此项消息从头到尾纯系凭空虚构之无耻造谣。
