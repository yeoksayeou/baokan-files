Applying Additional Fertilizer to Seedlings to Strive for Increased Production
　　Lucheng Seeks a Second Victory

　　[Report from our Lucheng Office] Lucheng County overcame the drought, fully securing over 90% of the autumn seedlings, achieving the first victory, and laying the foundation for the increased production campaign. After recalling the painful lessons of the 1943 famine and the experience of fighting the drought, the masses were mobilized ideologically, and the second battle began, launching a high tide of increased production. Zhang Jindong from Nanmazhuang said, "There was no way to deal with the famine, so the whole family fled to Nanmazhuang. We had nothing to eat, and managed to borrow two dou of corn, which the five of us ate for a month. It's really sad to think about." As he spoke, he began to cry. Mother Zhong Sheng said, "I went outside to survive the famine and left Zhong Sheng at home, which prevented us from seeing each other. That year, the Communist government called for self-reliance, and I planted vegetables to get through the famine." During the ideological mobilization, the masses had a simple idea of ​​thrift. The leadership proposed "comparison" to increase enthusiasm for increased production. At the Three-District Three-Linked Defense cadre meeting, after discussion, it was recognized that since the seedlings had been secured, if manure was applied to one hundred seedlings and weeded every day, the extra grain harvested would be better than picking wild vegetables for ten days. Relaxing the application of manure to the seedlings while only being thrifty would be grasping the small end and letting go of the big end. In addition to thrift, production must be increased. Further commending models of increased production and thrift also played a major role in promoting increased production. After ideological mobilization, the movement for increased production and thrift was widely launched. According to statistics: 1. Topdressing: In Gaojiazhuang, Fifth District, more than 100 mu of land were topdressed in one day, and nearly six qing of land were topdressed in the Fourth District. The masses in Li Village researched seven methods of topdressing: 1. Use manure from the latrine. 2. Use "quhui" (曲灰, ash from old beams and walls). Sweeping the dust from the kitchen ceiling, one jin of "quhui" is equivalent to one jin of oil. Usage: Take a pinch of "quhui" with three fingers and sprinkle it around the corn, then hoe it into a mound. 3. Oil mixed with chimney ash, mixed with water to form a tung oil-like consistency. Usage: Use a fire poker to poke a hole in the root of the corn, insert it, or pour it from a crack. This method does not burn the seedlings in dry weather, and it immediately moistens the roots when it rains. 4. Fried hemp seeds. Fry the hemp seeds, extract the oil, and use the residue with boiling water, using it in the same way as applying oil. 5. Oil mixed with chaff and dry manure. Mix the oil with the chaff, sprinkle it into the dry manure, mix it evenly, and it is good for topdressing both grain fields and cornfields. 6. Using oil for topdressing, buying four jin of oil with one dou of wheat can topdress eight mu of land and yield an additional one shi and six dou of corn. 2. The benefits can be seen in three months. 7. Use pig manure and sheep manure for topdressing, with the cooperative distributing one hundred carts of manure to the masses monthly to fertilize the land. The Fourth District's method of topdressing is to mobilize all men, women, old and young, livestock, and watering cans throughout the village. The livestock pull, people carry, women dig furrows, children pour manure, and men hoe mounds.
    2. Replanting wheat fields. In the Manliu River area of the Third District, six villages originally had more than 3,000 mu of wheat fields, with 1,400 mu replanted. In the Second District, more than 4,000 mu of wheat fields were replanted. Under the slogan of not leaving an inch of land idle, Luocun in the Second District replanted more than 1,000 mu.
    3. Under the slogan of increased production, sideline production has also become more active. Following the Hundred-Day Textile Movement, a Sixty-Day Textile Movement was launched. Men are taking time out to engage in transportation to exchange for grain, and cooperatives are also actively organizing to exchange for grain. Now, all villages are engaged in the second major battle, hoping to win another victory. (Joint Office)
    [Report from our Taiyue Office, 11th] After the Taiyue Xinhua Daily issued the call to "Strive for an 80% Harvest in a 50% Year," various places have universally launched crash planting, replanting, and weeding campaigns to increase yields. On the 3rd, Xiling Village, Second District of Yangcheng, held a meeting of all village cadres and mutual aid team leaders to discuss how to achieve an 80% harvest in a 50% year. First of all, intensive cultivation and careful work must be carried out to increase yields in order to make up for the losses suffered due to the drought. Production Director Liu Runji said, "Nothing is difficult in the world for one who sets his mind to it!" Village Chief Zhao Liben said, "Human power can overcome nature!" Then everyone started a discussion and challenge competition, making plans for an 80% harvest on the spot: (1) This year, the village has 3,600 mu of late seedlings, guaranteeing that the first weeding will be completed in a ten-day blitz. (2) This year, more small millet is planted, and the first weeding should be done with a small hoe so that the millet seedlings can make up for the old millet harvest. (3) Grains and corn should be weeded three times, cotton six times, and millet and beans twice. (4) Replant millet, beans, radishes, and cabbage on empty land and land where seedlings have not taken hold. Yangyao Village adopted the method of weeding late autumn crops more often, putting forward the slogan: "The hoe tops the spear; no weeding, no eating; one more weeding, a few more grains." The first weeding began on the 3rd. As soon as the bell rang in the morning, men, women, old and young went to the fields. Adults carried large hoes, and children carried small hoes. In the fields of the four mountains, groups of people worked with great energy. On the first day, Yang Suoqing's group of five people weeded seven mu, saving almost two workdays. The village cadres immediately called on everyone to learn from Yang Suoqing's group. In this way, the first weeding was completely completed in only four days, and preparations are now being made for the second weeding. Other places are increasing planting of autumn vegetables such as radishes and rapeseed.

　　普上追肥努力增产
  　潞城争取二次胜利
    【本报潞城讯】潞城战胜旱灾，全县百分之九十以上的秋苗完全捉住，取得第一次胜利，打下了增产运动的基础。经过回忆四三年灾荒的惨痛教训，及向旱灾作斗争的经验，从思想上发动起群众，开始第二次战斗，展开了增产运动的热潮。南马庄张金东说：“灾荒没法子，全家逃到南马庄来，没有吃的，没法借了二斗玉茭，五口人就吃了一个月，想起来真难过”。说着哭起来了，中胜母亲说：“我到外边渡荒把中胜丢到家，弄的我母子不能见面；那年共产党政府号召自救，我种上菜才渡过了荒”。在思想发动中，群众有单纯的节约思想，领导上提出“比较”，提高增产热情。三区三联防干部会议上，经讨论认识到已经捉住苗，若每天用粪奶苗耨上一百根苗，多打的粮食，比拔十天野菜都强，若放松了奶苗，而只节约，这是抓了小头放了大头，节约以外还要增产。再表扬增产节约模范，对增产也起了大的推动作用。经过思想发动后，增产节约运动普遍开展起来，据统计１、上追肥：五区高家庄在一天内上追肥一百余亩，四区上追肥者将近六顷。李村群众研究出追肥七种办法：一、用圊粪奶。二、用曲灰（即屋梁、老墙上的灰尘）奶。扫厨房顶上的灰，每斤曲灰顶一斤油。用法：用三个指头摄曲灰一撮，撒到玉茭周围，用锄耨起堆。三、油拌烟筒灰，和水拌成桐油状。用法：用火柱在玉茭根扎一个窟窿，贯进去或从裂缝上倒下去，这办法天旱不烧苗，一下雨立即阴到根上。四、炒大麻籽。把大麻籽炒了，打出油，用渣子和开水，用法和上油一样。五、油拌糠和干粪。以油拌糠，撒到干粪中，倒一遍和匀，上追肥上谷地玉茭地都好。六、用油奶，一斗麦子买四斤油，能上八亩地，可多打一石六斗玉茭。二、三个月能见利。七、用猪粪、羊粪奶，合作社按月把一百车粪分给群众奶地。四区上追肥的办法是全村男女老少、牲口、灌桶大动员，牲口拉的拉、人担的担，妇女刨圪道，小孩倒灌粪，男人耨圪堆。
    ２、回茬麦地。三区漫流河六个村原有麦地三千余亩，回茬一千四百亩。二区回茬麦地四千余亩。二区洛村在不闲一亩地的口号下，补种一千余亩。
    ３、在增产的口号下副业生产也更加活跃起来。接着百日纺织运动过后，又开展了六十日纺织运动。男人们在抽出时间来搞运输换粮食，合作社也积极的组织换回粮食。现在各村都进行着第二次的大战斗，盼望着再打一次胜仗。（联合办公室）
    【本报太岳十一日电】太岳新华日报发出“五成年景争取八成收”的号召后，各地普遍展开抢种补种与抢锄，以增加产量。阳城二区西岭村，三日召开全村干部及互助组长会议，讨论作到五成年景八成收的办法，首先必须精耕细作，增加收成，以弥补因旱灾遭受的损失。生产主任刘润积说：“天下无难事，只怕用心人！”村长赵立本说：“人力可以胜天！”接着大家互相展开讨论和挑战竞赛，当场作出八成收的计划：（一）今年全村晚苗三千六百亩，保证十天突击锄完头遍。（二）今年种小谷多，头遍要用小锄，谷苗可以顶住老谷收成。（三）谷、玉茭锄三遍，棉花锄六遍，黍、豆锄两遍。（四）空地及没捉住苗的地，再补种黍、豆、萝卜、白菜。杨腰村采用多锄晚秋办法，提出口号：“锄头顶干戈，不锄吃不上，多锄一次多长几颗粮食。”已于三日开始锄头遍，早上钟声一响，男女老少都上了地，大人扛大锄、儿童们扛小锄，四山的地里，一伙一伙干的一股劲。第一天杨锁庆组，五人锄了七亩，差不多省两个工，村干部即号召向杨锁庆组看齐。这样只经过四天，就将头遍完全锄完，现正准备锄二遍，其他地方纷纷增种萝卜油菜等秋菜。
