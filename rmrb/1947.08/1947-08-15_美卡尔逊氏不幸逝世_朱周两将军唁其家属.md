Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 13th. Generals Zhu De and Zhou Enlai, upon learning of the unfortunate death of Major General Carlson, Chairman of the American Committee for a Democratic Far Eastern Policy, sent a telegram of condolence to his family. The telegram reads as follows:

To the Family of Major General Carlson, Portland, USA:

The death of Major General Carlson, a close friend of China, is a loss for both the Chinese and American people. Major General Carlson's contributions to defeating Japanese imperialism, enhancing friendship between the Chinese and American people, and striving for a progressive American foreign policy will always be remembered by the Chinese people. Due to the obstruction of the war, we have only now learned of this sad news, and we are deeply saddened. We send our condolences.

Zhu De, Zhou Enlai, August 11th.

According to reports, during China's War of Resistance Against Japan, Carlson served as a naval attaché at the US Embassy in China. Admiring the Eighth Route Army, he visited the liberated areas of Jin-Cha-Ji, Jin-Ji-Lu-Yu, and Jin-Sui twice between 1938 and 1939 to investigate the reality of the people's war of resistance against Japan. After the United States declared war on Japan, while leading the Second Marine Division of the US Navy in the Pacific War, Carlson, based on the experience of the Eighth Route Army, recruited determined anti-Japanese American youths who were not afraid of hardship and possessed a democratic spirit to organize the famous Carlson's Raiders, conducting guerrilla warfare at sea. He was wounded in the landing operation on Makin Island. After Japan's surrender, Carlson initiated the establishment of the American Committee for a Democratic Far Eastern Policy in the United States, leading the movement to aid China's democratization and sparing no effort to oppose the American imperialists' support for Chiang Kai-shek's dictatorial civil war. Unfortunately, he passed away in Portland, western United States, on May 27th of this year due to a heart condition.
