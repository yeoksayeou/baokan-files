　　Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, August 26th: London - The "Truth" weekly here, in criticizing MacArthur's policy of controlling Japan, stated: MacArthur plans to turn Japan into an exclusive factory for American big businesses, continuing to insult and disregard the rights of other Allied nations who jointly defeated Japan. The journal, in criticizing MacArthur for allowing Japan to resume foreign trade and arbitrarily setting the total number of foreign merchants at 400, placing the United States first (receiving 102 slots) and Britain second (receiving 64 slots), said: Never in history has a responsible nation, obligated to its victorious partners, indulged a figure like MacArthur to act arrogantly towards the allies on whom it depended for its survival as the United States has done. The magazine concluded: Once MacArthur leaves the military, he will be a cunning and unscrupulous horse trader, certain to earn his worth on Wall Street.

　　麦克阿瑟独占日本  英国舆论猛予抨击
    【新华社陕北二十六日电】伦敦讯：此间“真理”周刊抨击麦克阿瑟对日管制政策时称：麦克阿瑟计划把日本变为美国大企业之独占工厂，继续侮慢与无视其他共同战胜日本之盟国的权利。该刊在抨击麦克阿瑟准许日本恢复对外贸易并擅定外商总数为四百，把美国放在第一位（分得一百零二名）、英国第二位（分得六十四名）时说：历史上从未有过对其胜利伙伴有义务的负责国家，象美国这样放纵麦克阿瑟一类人物，对其曾赖以生存的盟国作威作福。该杂志结语称：麦克阿瑟一旦离开军界，那他将是一个狡黠而肆无忌惮的马贩子，一定能在华尔街博得自己的身价。
