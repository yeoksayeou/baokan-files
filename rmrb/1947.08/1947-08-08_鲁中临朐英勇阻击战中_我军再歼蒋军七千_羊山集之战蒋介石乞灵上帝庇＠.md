Xinhua News Agency, East China Front, 6th: A unit of the East China People's Liberation Army, starting from the evening of July 24th, heroically blocked the Chiang army's 8th Division (formerly a reorganized army) which invaded from Changle and Weixian and occupied Linqu city. The People's Liberation Army fought continuously in rain and wading through water. By the 30th, the 307th and 308th regiments of the 103rd Brigade of that division had been completely annihilated. Over 1,000 Chiang army officers and soldiers were captured, and over 6,000 were killed or wounded. The captured equipment is currently being inventoried.

Xinhua News Agency, Ji-Lu-Yu Front, 6th: In the telegrams of Chiang's 66th Division captured by General Liu Bocheng's troops, it was discovered that several days before the division was annihilated at Yangshanji, the division commander, Song Ruike, had repeatedly telegraphed Chiang, urgently requesting reinforcements. In a state of panic and helplessness, Chiang even begged for God's blessing. The original telegram stated: "The bitter fighting at Yangshanji fills Zhongzheng with anxiety. I hope my brother will convey to the officers and soldiers and all comrades that although we are in a time of crisis, we should hold on to the end, hoping that you trust in God's blessing and strive for the last five minutes of victory. Chiang Kai-shek, 20th." Chiang Kai-shek's frantic and exhausted state is fully revealed.

Xinhua News Agency, Ji-Lu-Yu Front, 6th: Before the annihilation of Chiang's 66th Division, they carried out inhumane destruction in Yangshanji (north of Jinxiang city) in Southwestern Shandong. After the People's Liberation Army entered Yangshanji, almost none of the more than 1,000 households in the village had a complete house. Houses were collapsed, walls were full of bullet holes and craters, and courtyards and rooms were full of bunkers and communication trenches. The doors and windows of every household were torn down to be used as fortifications. The eighty or ninety rooms belonging to the Hou family were all torn down, and two large buildings were burned down. All the trees, grain, cattle, sheep, pigs, and chickens in the village were cut down, looted, and eaten. On July 26th alone, fifty-eight cattle were slaughtered by Chiang's army. Men were locked up in the God of Wealth Temple at night, and women were raped by Chiang's army in their homes. Five women from Li Jinbang's family were raped by a dozen Chiang soldiers. Li Zhengren's wife was raped by four or five Chiang soldiers and is still lying in bed, unable to move. An old woman said: "They (referring to Chiang's army) are all cowards and have less humanity than the Japanese." After the democratic government's district office entered the town with the army, it immediately organized the people to bury the dead bodies, clean the streets, and provide relief to the refugees and other post-war reconstruction work.

    羊山集之战蒋介石乞灵上帝庇＠
    【新华社华东前线六日电】华东解放军一部，于七月二十四日晚起，在临朐城区阻击由昌乐、潍县南犯侵占临朐城之蒋军第八师（原军），解放军连日冒雨涉水作战，迄三十日止，已将该师一○三旅之三○七、三○八两个团全部歼灭，生俘蒋军官兵一千余人，毙伤六千余人，缴获正清查中。
    【新华社冀鲁豫前线六日电】刘伯承将军所部缴获蒋军六十六师之电文中，发现当该师于羊山集覆灭之前数日，该师师长宋瑞珂曾接连电蒋告急求援。蒋于惊惶无策之余，竟乞求上帝庇＠，原电称：“羊山集苦战，中正闻之忧心如焚。望吾弟转告部下官兵暨诸同志，目前虽处于危急之秋，亦应固守到底，希弟信赖上帝庇＠，争取最后五分钟之胜利。二十日蒋中正。”蒋介石焦头烂额，计穷力竭之状，毕露无遗。
    【新华社冀鲁豫前线六日电】蒋军六十六师覆灭之前，在鲁西南羊山集（金乡城北）进行了惨无人道的摧残。当人民解放军进入羊山集后，该村一千多户，几乎没有一所完整的房子。房屋倒塌了，墙壁上满是枪眼和窟窿，院里房里挖满了地堡和交通沟，家家户户的门窗全被拆去作了工事。侯姓家的八九十间房子，全被拆光，两座大楼被烧毁。全村所有的树木、粮食及牛、羊、猪、鸡全被砍光、抢光和吃光。七月二十六日一天之内，就被蒋军宰掉了五十八头牛，男人在黑夜里都被关到财神庙里，妇女在家里被蒋军轮奸。李金榜家五个女人，被十几个蒋军强奸，李正仁的媳妇，被四五个蒋军轮奸，至今还躺在炕上不能动弹。一个老太太说：“他们（指蒋军）都是孬种，比日本人还没有人性。”民主政府区公所随军进入该镇后，即全力组织人民掩埋死尸，打扫街道，救济难民等善后工作。
