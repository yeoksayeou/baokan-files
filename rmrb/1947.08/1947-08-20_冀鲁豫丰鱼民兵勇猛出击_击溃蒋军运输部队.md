　　Ji-Lu-Yu Feng-Yu Militia Bravely Attacks
　　Defeats Chiang Kai-shek's Army Transport Troops
　　[This newspaper, Ji-Lu-Yu, 16th dispatch] (Delayed) The Feng (County) Yu (Tai) County Shou-Xian District militia of Ji-Lu-Yu intercepted a Chiang Kai-shek army transport team and cooperated with the main force in combat, winning a major victory. On July 19th, the Feng-Yu Shou-Xian District militia discovered a transport unit of the enemy's 3rd Division, consisting of twelve large carts and about a hundred guards, at Sanzuolou on the Ji-Yu Highway. They immediately prepared to intercept them. After our district chief and director of the District Armed Forces Committee repeatedly scouted several times (about twenty *li* per trip) and ascertained the situation, they decided to intercept the enemy. With only ten or so of our men, we used swift and courageous actions to defeat the enemy and pursued them for four or five *li*, capturing twelve large enemy carts, capturing twenty enemies, and killing one enemy adjutant. We seized 7,000 rounds of ammunition, 150 large and small artillery shells, 330 hand grenades, about 2,000 *jin* of foreign flour in sixty bags, one artillery sight, twenty rifle grenades, more than forty military blankets, a portion of military uniforms, three Czech rifles, and one pistol. In this battle, with a force ten times smaller than the enemy, we defeated the enemy and seized a great deal of spoils, providing powerful support to the frontline field army. The Third Military Sub-district of the Ji-Lu-Yu Military Region issued a circular of commendation and called on all troops and armed forces in all counties and districts to learn from Shou-Xian District.
