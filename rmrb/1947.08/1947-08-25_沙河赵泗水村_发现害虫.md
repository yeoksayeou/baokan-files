　　Shahe Zhaosishui Village Discovers Pests

    [This newspaper, Shahe] Following the 24 villages in the Second and Third Districts, a pest infestation has also been discovered west of Zhaosishui Village in the Sixth District. Four or five mu of land are largely infested with green, yellow-headed insects, each six or seven fen in length, that have already chewed the grain leaves into mottled patterns. One day, Comrade Hao of our county government's production department was talking with villagers on the street when he saw a mule driver returning from the fields. He called the villager over and quietly said, "Our village's west side has pests!" The implication was that "the more you talk about divine insects, the more there will be," or that they were afraid the cadres would find out and order them to fight the pests, so they dared not speak loudly. After Comrade Hao Kui-sheng heard this, he reported the situation to the county government. County Chief Wang immediately convened the main cadres of the county government to study how to break superstition and lead the effort to eliminate the pests. Subsequently, they exchanged past experiences in pest control: (1) Knocking them off with sticks and beating them to death. (2) Holding a foreign-style kerosene can in one hand and a stick in the other, knocking along the rows, the insects fall into the can, which is then emptied into a pit at the end of the field and crushed to death. (3) Using an iron ring with a net bag attached, knocking it along the rows (knocking the grain stalks), the insects fall into the net bag and are beaten to death. It was decided that whoever goes to that district will be led by Chief Wang of the Civil Affairs Section after breakfast, and they will go to the Second, Third, and Sixth Districts to lead the pest control effort. People have also been sent to the Fifth and Seventh Districts to scout for pests. (Li Congli)
    [This newspaper, Wu'an] In the Second District's Xihu, Bingshan, and Dongxi Dazhan villages, a type of insect has been discovered that is severely eating the grain ears and leaves. The affected area is about five fang li in size. The insects are blackish-green, with the larger ones being over an inch long (market foot), and the smaller ones being as small as a thread end. They have yellow, white, red, and green stripes on their bodies, and their heads are blackish-yellow with black stripes. According to the villagers, this type of insect is most destructive to grain, capable of eating it all in three to five days, especially in watery fields. They eat from sunset until dawn, and during the day they do not eat, hiding under the grain leaves and inside the leaf sheaths. They were first discovered in areas with the most weeds along the edges of the fields. Now, the masses in Xihu Village are repairing pest-catching tools and rising up to capture them. (Feng Lin)

　　沙河赵泗水村发现害虫
    【本报沙河讯】继二、三区二十四村之后，六区赵泗水村西也发现虫灾，有四、五亩大地方多是绿虫黄头，都是六七分长，已将谷叶咬成花斑。我县府生产部郝同志一天在街和老乡谈话，见有一个牵骡子的从地回来，将老乡叫过去悄悄说：“咱村西生了虫子了！”意思是“神虫越说越多”，或怕干部知道要叫去打，不敢大声说出。郝魁生同志听到后，将情况报告县府，王县长遂即召集县府主要干部，研究如何破除迷信领导扑灭。随后交流了过去打虫经验：（一）用棍敲落打死。（二）一手提一个洋筒，一手拿棍，顺垄敲打，虫掉到筒里，到地头倒在坑里捣死。（三）用一个铁圈带一个网斗，顺垄磕过去（磕谷杆），虫掉在网斗里打死。经决定谁上那区后，吃过早饭统由民政科王科长带领，分头到二、三、六区领导打虫，五、七区也派人侦察中。（从里）
    【本报武安讯】二区西湖、饼山、东西大栈等村，发现一种虫子吃谷穗和谷叶很厉害，面积约有五方里之大，虫子的形状是黑绿色，体长大的有一寸多长（市尺），小的如线头大，身上有黄白红绿色的花道，头部是黑黄色有黑道。据老百姓谈，此类形的虫子吃谷子最厉害，三、五天内就能吃光，特别是水地最多，吃的时间是在太阳落山时分，吃到天明为止，到白天就不吃了，藏在谷叶底下和谷叶桶里面。在地边杂草最多的地方先发现，现在西湖村群众正在修理捉虫武器，奋起捕捉。（凤琳）
