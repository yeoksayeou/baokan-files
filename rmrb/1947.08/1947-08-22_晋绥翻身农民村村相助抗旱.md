Xinhua News Agency, Shanxi-Suiyuan, August 18th: The emancipated peasants in Shanxi-Suiyuan, having obtained land, are helping each other overcome the difficulties of the drought. Villages along the upper reaches of the river between Fangshan and Lishi broke with the old conventions of surrendering to drought. They released water for five days, and the masses downstream were overjoyed, wading through knee-deep mud to dig ditches, saving the seedlings of over ten villages' worth of irrigated land. At the same time, the local plain farmers, who originally planned to sow winter wheat in the irrigated fields after the summer harvest, voluntarily allocated a portion of their irrigated land to the mountain farmers for growing vegetables, to solve the problem of grain shortages for this winter and next spring, since the soil in the mountains was too dry to sow. In addition, the masses everywhere are generally helping each other solve difficulties with plowing cattle, seeds, and food rations. Zhongyang's Chengguan allocated over 17 million local currency and ten shi of food from the fruits of land reform and sent it to the masses outside the city to be distributed. According to reports from various places, the seedlings in the land that was deeply plowed in the autumn and hoed during the summer heat (plowing the land during the summer heat, pressing the grass and other things into the soil to rot as fertilizer) last year are now lush and even; conversely, there are missing seedlings or thin and weak ears. The Shanxi-Suiyuan Administrative Office has issued instructions, calling on all localities to help poor peasants and hired laborers with deep plowing in the autumn and hoeing during the summer heat, to make long-term plans.

　　晋绥翻身农民村村相助抗旱
    【新华社晋绥十八日电】晋绥得地翻身农民，患难相助，克服旱灾困难。方山离石间沿河上游村庄打破往年逢旱成规，放水五天，下游群众欢欣鼓舞，踏着及膝的泥浆开挖水沟。救了十余村水地的禾苗。同时当地平川农民原拟于水地夏收后播种冬季雪麦，因山地土干无法下种，特自动拨出一部分水地给山地农民种菜，以解决今冬明春之贷粮。此外各地群众普遍互助解决耕牛、种籽及口粮困难，中阳城关由清算果实中拨出本币一千七百余万元食粮十石，送给城外群众分，朔县黎阳村一次即资助邻庄十万元。另据各地反映，去年经翻秋及扣伏荒（在伏天翻地，将草等压在土内沤作肥料）的地，今年禾苗茁茂匀整；反之则缺苗或穗细薄弱。晋绥行署特发出指示，号召各地帮助贫雇农翻秋扣伏，作长期打算。
