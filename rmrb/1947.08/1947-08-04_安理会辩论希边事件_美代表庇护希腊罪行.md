    Security Council Debates Greek Border Incident
    US Representative Protects Greek Crimes
    [Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 1st] Xun: Since late last month, the Security Council has once again discussed the so-called Greek border incident. The Greek reactionaries, in order to cover up their crimes in the civil war, have falsely accused Yugoslavia, Bulgaria, and Albania of harboring refugees who fled the persecution of the Greek government and supporting the Greek guerrillas in their operations. The US representative in the Security Council vigorously defended the Greek crimes and shifted all responsibility to Yugoslavia, Bulgaria, and Albania. The US proposed that the Security Council establish a semi-permanent Balkan border monitoring group that could freely go to various countries to "investigate" and "reconcile" related disputes. The Soviet representative, Gromyko, strongly opposed this attempt to interfere in the administrative organizations of Yugoslavia, Bulgaria, and Albania. He suggested that the solution to these disputes lay in improving the political situation within Greece, establishing an independent and democratic Greece, and improving its relations with neighboring countries and dealing with all outstanding issues such as refugees through normal international relations. Due to the manipulation of the majority by the US representative, the US proposal was adopted. The Soviet Union then used its veto power at the meeting on the 29th.

    安理会辩论希边事件
    美代表庇护希腊罪行
    【新华社陕北一日电】成功湖讯：自上月下旬迄今，安理会又再次讨论所谓希腊边境事件。希腊反动政府为了掩盖其内战罪行，竟诬告南、保、阿三国收容因希政府迫害而亡命的难民，为支持希腊游击队作战。美代表在安理会中极力为希腊罪行庇护，而把一切责任推卸到南、保、阿身上。并建议要安理会设立一个半永久性巴尔干边境监视团，该团可以自由到各国去“调查”及“和解”有关纠纷事件。苏联代表葛罗米珂竭力反对此种干涉南、保、阿等国行政组织之企图。建议由改进希腊国内的政治形势，来解决这些纠纷，建立一个独立民主的希腊，经由正常的国际关系，以改善其与邻国之关系及处理难民等一切未决的问题。由于美代表之操纵多数，美国建议竟获得通过，苏联乃于二十九日之会议中，使用否决权。
