Xinhua News Agency, Central China, August 26th: A correspondent from this branch commented on the tragic end of Hao Pengju's 42nd Group Army after it defected to Jiang, stating: The successive annihilation of Hao's rebel remnants provides a good mirror for all traitors of the people. Eleven days after Hao rebelled against the people and defected to Jiang in January of this year, he was captured alive by the People's Liberation Army in the Battle of Baitabu in the eastern section of the Longhai Railway. His headquarters and the entire Second Division were annihilated, and part of the Fourth Division was also wiped out. Later, Bi Shuwen, the acting commander-in-chief, continued to use the "Group Army" signboard, but in reality, only seven remnant regiments remained. Jiang then transferred this unit to northern and central Jiangsu to fill the gaps. When this unit was transferred to the Funing and Dongtai line, before it could catch its breath, the People's Liberation Army annihilated its 12th Regiment of the Fourth Division at Dazhongji and Xinfengzhen at the end of April. In May, several hundred more were wiped out at Baiju. In this Salt City campaign, its First Division was completely annihilated. Very little of it remains. After this unit defected to Jiang, it went three months without receiving pay, relying entirely on plunder for survival. Fifty percent of their rifles were old models, and over four hundred officers were squeezed out and dismissed. A portion of them were even subjected to strict prohibition and execution. By July, Jiang wanted to completely annex them, summoning Bi to Nanjing and ordering the Group Army to be transferred to Nantong and Rugao for reorganization. Bi responded miserably: "If you want to transfer, transfer me personally, otherwise the troops will run away, and I won't be responsible." Now the reorganization has not been completed, and its First Division has been destroyed again.

Xinhua News Agency, Central China, August 28th: Jiang's puppet troops in northern Jiangsu, terrified by the news of the People's Liberation Army's capture of Yeting City and the annihilation of the entire First Division of Hao's rebel remnants, are in a state of panic. A company of the Jiang-affiliated garrison and security team in Yuelai, northeast of Huaiyin, fled upon hearing the news, and the area was immediately recovered. Jiang's troops in Lianshui have been digging a moat 2.5 zhang wide and 1.5 zhang deep outside the city for days. The city gates are filled with bricks and stones, leaving only narrow exits, and blockhouses are built to guard the streets. Jiang's troops in Funing are also harassing the residents and building embankments and rivers outside the city. Local landlords and thugs are even more frightened by the capture of over 3,000 members of the "Returning Home Corps" in Salt City, trembling with fear. In recent days, nine people, including Liu Qichang, have repented and surrendered to the democratic government.

Xinhua News Agency, Central China, August 28th: Various documents seized from the Jiang side during the Salt City campaign show that the Jiang army's discipline is deteriorating and has spread to all units. In the East China battlefield alone, according to the "Daily Report on Military Discipline Warnings for June" issued by the Jiang-affiliated Army Headquarters Xuzhou Command, there are twenty-one reorganized divisions listed for "violations of military discipline." Officers are the worst offenders. The report lists over five hundred high-ranking Jiang army officers guilty of misconduct. The listed offenses include dozens of crimes such as "raping women," "kidnapping girls," "burning houses," "looting property," "falsely reporting numbers," and "embezzling military pay." For example, Luo Yusheng, the regimental commander of the 553rd Regiment of the 185th Brigade of the 66th Division (note: annihilated in the Yangshanji campaign in the Hebei-Shandong-Henan area), "raped a woman and enticed a girl to run away." Wang Yintang, the company commander of the Engineering Corps, extorted 300,000 yuan from residents of Dingji, Shuyang, under the guise of "reception" expenses. Telegram No. 31667 from Li Mo'an's Jiang-affiliated First Pacification Zone Command stated: "The discipline of all units has been lax recently," "Unscrupulous officers and soldiers of the National Army and local teams are arbitrarily plundering materials to fill their own pockets, greatly losing popular support, and the officers and soldiers are not firm in their will to fight, affecting combat effectiveness."

　　背叛人民终无好下场
  　郝逆残部被歼殆尽　苏北蒋伪恐惶万状
    【新华社华中二十六日电】分社记者评郝逆鹏举四十二集团军投蒋之悲惨下场称：郝逆残部的相继就歼，给一切人民叛逆提供了一面很好的镜子。郝逆于今年一月背叛人民投靠蒋贼后十一天，即在陇海东段白塔埠战役为解放军生擒，其总部及第二师全部就歼，第四师被歼一部。后由毕逆书文代总司令，仍挂着“集团军”招牌，实际只剩七个残团。被蒋贼调来苏北、苏中填补空隙。当该部调至阜宁、东台一线，喘息未定，解放军即于四月底在大中集新丰镇歼灭其第四师之第十二团。五月，又于白驹歼其数百人，这次盐城战役，其第一师又被消灭得一干二净。其余所存无几。当该部投蒋之后，曾有三个月领不到饷，专靠抢掠为生，步枪百分之五十，都是老套筒，四百余军官破排挤革职，其中一部并遭到严禁和枪杀。到七月，蒋贼更想彻底吞并，叫毕逆到南京，限令时该集团军调至南通、如皋整编。毕狼狈答称：“要调就调我个人，否则部队跑光了，我不负责。”现在调编未成，其第一师即告复灭。
    【新华社华中二十八日电】苏北蒋伪慑于解放军攻克叶挺城，全歼郝逆残部一师之声威惶恐万状。淮阴东北悦来蒋记驻军军保安队，一个中队，闻风逃走，该地即告收复。涟水蒋军连日在城外挖成宽二丈五尺，深一丈五尺之护城壕，城门用砖石填塞，仅留狭小出口，各街道亦筑碉把守。阜宁蒋军亦乱居民，在城外捍筑圩河。各地土蒋更因盐城“还乡团”三千余人全部被擒吓得胆战心惊，连日已有刘其昌等九名向民主政府悔过自新。
    【新华社华中二十八日电】盐城战役缴获之多种蒋方文件均显示蒋军军纪败坏，已遍及所有部队。仅华东战场，据蒋记陆军总部徐州司令部所发“六月份警饬军风纪日报表”即列有“违反军纪”之部队达二十一个整编师。其中尤以军官为最坏。表中所举败坏军纪蒋军高级官佐，即达五百余人。所列罪行，包括“强奸民妇”，“拐骗民女”、“烧毁民房”、“劫夺民财”、“虚报空额”、“克克军饷”等数十种。如整六十六师（按已于冀鲁豫羊山集战役就歼）一八五旅五五三团团长罗玉胜即曾“强奸民妇，并诱骗民女脱逃”。工兵团连长王荫堂驻沭阳丁集时曾向居民诈索“招待”三十万元。蒋记第一个靖区司令官李默庵部字三一六六七号代电供称：“各部队日来纪律废弛”“国军及地方团队不肖官兵任意掠夺物资，以饱私囊，大失民心，官兵战志不坚，影响战力。”
