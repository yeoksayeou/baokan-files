　　Fucun, East Camel
  　Accumulate Fertilizer and Prepare Wheat Fields
    [Our Newspaper] After the thorough rain in Xiangyuan Third District's Fucun, the peasants became complacent. Wang Meixiu's wife said, "Since there has been a thorough rain, this year's harvest will be good, and we can rest assured that we will have a meal of noodles!" The leadership organized the masses to discuss how much harvest could be expected from the fields. Fu Yintai said, "I think this year will be a good year, with a 90% harvest. My three mu of sesame land in Xihewan can yield five shi, and my five mu of millet can yield six or seven shi. With just these two pieces of land, I won't have to worry about starving." Old man Fu Jinquan continued, "Our whole village has only 300 mu of river bend land out of 3,170 mu. We can't just look at your one or two plots. Our village grows a lot of beans in the river bend land, and the seedlings grow well, but there are no pods under the bean stalks. In the third year of Guangxu, people starved to death under the millet ears. Are we not afraid of starving to death now?" After some argument, everyone clarified that a reduced harvest was certain. Zhou Goudan said, "We can't just save without increasing production. Now we need to accumulate a lot of fertilizer to apply to the wheat fields." Fu Jinquan said, "Last year I applied 25 dan of fertilizer to one mu of wheat, and this year it yielded two shi. The ancients said that to be able to cultivate and plant, one must also apply manure." Everyone discussed how to accumulate fertilizer and what to accumulate. Fu Weihu said, "Now we can cut artemisia to make fertilizer, dig latrines, build kang, and smoke the soil, etc." Within five days after the meeting, a total of 13,840 dan of fertilizer were accumulated for 727.5 mu of wheat land, averaging 19 dan per mu. Now all the men and women in the village have been actively organized to cut artemisia to make fertilizer, ensuring that the wheat fields are well fertilized. The whole village has 46 head of livestock, and the first plowing of the wheat fields has been completed. Now they are preparing to plow a second time. According to the livestock power conditions, they can strive to plow three times, to thoroughly plow the wheat fields, deeply cultivate them, and apply more fertilizer. At present, the masses in the whole village are stepping up production to strive for more grain and make up for the poor harvest.
    [Our Newspaper, Licheng] In Dongluotuo, Wang Songcai's group, under the leadership of Labor Hero Wang Yanyan, unanimously proposed to convert more wheat fields to increase grain production. The whole group has prepared 20 mu of dry wheat land and is preparing to convert 40 mu. There are also 29.2 mu lacking fertilizer. Everyone discussed ways to collect fertilizer: 1. Make kang soil. 2. Build more side dikes and spread the soil from the dikes on the ground. 3. Cut weeds and artemisia to smoke the barren land and make fertilizer, both repairing the land and collecting fertilizer. They also put forward the slogan: "Sleep on the land in spring, cut weeds in autumn, collect fertilizer and plant wheat to overcome famine."

　　傅村·东骆驼
  　积肥垡麦地
    【本报讯】襄垣三区傅村，在这次下了透雨后，农民们思想上产生了麻痹，王梅秀老婆说：“天已下了透雨，今年年成还好，这可放心吃上顿面吧！”领导上组织群众讨论田禾有多少收成？傅银太说：“我觉得今年好年景，九分收成，我西河湾芝麻地三亩，能打五石，谷五亩又能打六、七石，光这两块地，也不怕饿死我。”傅金全老汉接着说：“咱全村三千一百七十亩地才有三百亩河湾地，还不能光看你那一两块。咱村河湾地种豆多，苗长的倒好，可是豆角底下没荚，光绪三年谷穗底下饿死人，这倒不怕饿死人啦？”经过圪扯，大家明确了减收是肯定了，周苟旦说：“咱们光节约不增产可不行，现在要大量积肥往麦地里上。”傅金全说：“去年我种了一亩麦上了二十五担肥，今年就打了二石，古人说能耕会种还得上粪。”大家研究了怎样积肥，积什么？傅维胡说：“现在可以割蒿沤肥、挖茅坑、打炕、薰土等都行。”会后五天内共积肥一万三千八百四十担，麦地七百二十七亩半，每亩平均十九担，现在全村男女已积极的组织起来割蒿沤肥，做到麦地要上饱肥。全村有牲口四十六头，麦地头遍都犁完。现正准备耕二遍，根据畜力条件能争取到耕完三遍，要把麦地翻透，普遍深耕细作多上肥。目前全村群众正在加紧生产，争取多打粮食，弥补歉收。
    【本报黎城讯】东骆驼王松才组，在劳英王颜彦领导下一致提出多改麦地，增加粮食，全组共垡旱麦地廿亩，准备改茬四十亩，还有二九·二亩缺肥，大家研究集肥办法：一、打炕土。二、多修边堰，把堰上土除下撒到地。三、割荒割蒿薰荒沤肥，一方面修了地、一方面集了肥。并提出口号，春卧地，秋割荒，集肥种麦渡灾荒。
