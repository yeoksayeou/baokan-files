　　Jizhong Guerrilla Forces Counter "Mopping-Up" Operations
  　Continue to Annihilate 400 Chiang Kai-shek and Puppet Troops
    [Xinhua News Agency, Jin-Cha-Ji, 26th] Local armed forces and militias, persisting in the liberated areas north of the Daqing River, have continued to annihilate over 420 Chiang Kai-shek and puppet troops who were disrupting the area. From the 7th to the 15th, guerrilla forces fought 17 battles in Ba County and on both sides of the Ba(County)-Niu(Tuo) highway, eliminating over 60 enemies and twice raiding enemy troops occupying Ba County at night. Over 100 enemies were also eliminated within Xiong County, and over 50 enemy stragglers and puppet special agents were captured. On the 10th, another unit of local armed forces ambushed enemy transport near Gezhuang Village in Gu'an County, destroying one enemy vehicle and seizing 84 million yuan, a month's salary for all officers and soldiers of the 13th Army's 4th Division.
    [Xinhua News Agency, Jin-Cha-Ji, 28th] Last month, when Chiang Kai-shek's and puppet troops harassed western Jizhong and Ding(County), Tang(County), and Wang(du) areas along the Ping-Han Railway, they committed all kinds of atrocities, including rape, arson, looting, and wanton insults, especially against Muslims. On July 16, a unit of Chiang Kai-shek's 16th Army, when it infiltrated Xihuai Village west of Ji County, slaughtered live pigs in the mosque and filled the "cleanse body" area with urine and feces. When they infiltrated Xilou Village in the county on the 18th, even the young daughter of Zhao Hongquan, the director of the joint office of Xiong County, Rongcheng, and three other counties under Chiang Kai-shek's regime, was raped in the open. Her mother knelt and pleaded, "Her father is the director on your side; we are all one family. Please spare her." The raping Chiang Kai-shek soldier replied, "He is his director, and I am doing what I want." On July 16, when this unit of Chiang Kai-shek's and puppet troops infiltrated Qingliangcheng and other places in Qingyuan, they looted 200 dan of food in Qingliang alone, and many people were brutally killed. An old woman over seventy years old in Liutuodian was also raped. In Dongxi Edge in Tang County and Tuo area in Wangdu, all the houses were burned down. Now, democratic governments in various places are comforting the families of the victims and helping them rebuild their homes.

    【新华社晋察冀二十六日电】坚持大清河以北解放区地方武装及民兵，续歼窜扰该地区蒋伪四百二十余名。七日至十五日游击队在霸县及霸牛（坨）公路两侧作战达十七次，歼敌六十余，并两度夜袭侵占霸县之敌。雄县境内亦歼敌百余，并捕捉敌散兵与伪特人员五十余。十日，另部地方武装在固安县各庄附近伏击敌运输，击毁敌汽车一辆，缴获敌十三军第四师全体官兵一月薪饷八千四百万元。
    【新华社晋察冀二十八日电】上月蒋伪军窜扰冀中西部及平汉沿线定（县）唐（县）望（都）等地时，所到之处奸淫烧杀抢掠无所不为，对回民尤肆意侮辱。七月十六日蒋十六军一部窜抵击县西槐村时，在清真寺内大宰活猪，“净身”内拉满尿屎。当八日窜抵该县西楼村时，连蒋记雄县、容城等五县联合办事处处长赵红泉之幼女也于露天下被强奸，其母跪地哀求说：“他爹在你们那边当处长，都是一家人，饶饶吧。”奸淫的蒋军答说：“他当他的处长，我搞我的。”该部蒋伪军十六日窜抵清苑之清凉城等处，仅在清凉即抢走食粮二百大石，群众被惨杀极多。刘托店一位七十多岁老妪亦被强奸。唐县之东西边缘、望都之陀等地，房屋全都被烧光。现各地民主政府正抚慰死难家属，帮助他们重整家园。
