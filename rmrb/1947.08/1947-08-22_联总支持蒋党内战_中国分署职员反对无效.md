　　UNRRA Supports Chiang Kai-shek's Party's Civil War
  　China Office Staff's Opposition Ineffective
    Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 20th – According to Shanghai, 18th, news: Staff of the UNRRA China Office have submitted a firm petition to the UNRRA Central Committee in Washington, requesting that UNRRA immediately stop using relief supplies to transport goods to the Kuomintang government, in order to change the unfair situation created by UNRRA's decision at the end of last month to stop relief to areas north of 34 degrees north latitude (referring to the liberated areas). The petition was submitted by more than half of the UNRRA staff stationed in China. They firmly requested that UNRRA ships and vehicles not be used to support the Kuomintang government, and demanded that they be transferred from the embarrassing position of supporting one side of the Chinese civil war. Furthermore, according to Washington news on the same day, the UNRRA Central Committee has received the aforementioned petition, but the agency's spokesperson openly supported the Kuomintang's tone in a statement, saying that this action was a "personal action," "not only unwise, but also inappropriate, and at the same time, it would only confuse the issue." From this point, it is clear that UNRRA's support for the Kuomintang's civil war violates the principle of relief not being based on political stance.

　　联总支持蒋党内战
  　中国分署职员反对无效
    【新华社陕北二十日电】据上海十八日消息：联总中国分署职员已向华盛顿联总中央委员会提出坚决的声请书，要求联总立即停止以救济物资运与国民党政府，以改变上月底联总决定停止对北纬三十四度以北地区（按即解放地区）救济所造成之不公平情势。该声请书为联总派驻中国职员二分之一以上所提出。他们坚请勿以联总船只及车辆供国民党政府使用，并要求将他们调离支持中国内战一方之难堪地位。又据同日华盛顿消息，联总中央委员会业已接获上述声请书，但该署发言人竟然公开支持国民党之口吻发表谈话，说此项行动为“个人行动”，“不仅不智，亦属不当，同时反足使问题混淆”。由此一点，联总之支持国民党内战，违背救济不分政治立场之原则，业已昭然若揭。
