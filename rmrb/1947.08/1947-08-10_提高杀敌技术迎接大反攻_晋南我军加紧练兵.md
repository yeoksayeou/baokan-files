    Improve Killing Techniques to Welcome the Great Counter-Offensive
    Our Army in Southern Shanxi Intensifies Training
    [This newspaper, Taiyue, 6th dispatch] A certain brigade under General Chen Geng is engaged in a vigorous training movement to rapidly improve combat skills in order to welcome the upcoming great counter-offensive. Their slogan: "Sharpen the knife if it's not sharp enough!" The 12th Company of a certain regiment used to be poor at grenade throwing, but now has improved to an average of 41 meters. The sharpshooters of the 3rd Company of a certain regiment practiced hitting "head targets" during offensive exercises, achieving perfect accuracy. The 5th Company was the fastest at building assault bridges, taking only seven seconds. Generally, they could erect ladders in about twenty seconds. In one exercise, the 7th Company launched an assault on a city, starting from 100 meters away, and completing the process of building assault bridges, erecting ladders, and passing over the city wall in just five minutes. They trained hard, forgetting to eat and sleep, day and night. The famous combat hero Shi Lailiang was sick before the training, but he concealed it and continued to lead the entire squad in training for half a month. The squad of Ma Shangzhi was mostly comprised of liberated soldiers and was the most backward in the past. After hard training led by Ma Shangzhi, they have now become a training model. Another characteristic of this training is that everyone has brought their wisdom into play. Wang Zhansheng and He Ruxi of the 9th Company invented a new ladder-building method. Comrade Li Jianhua, the squad leader of the 3rd Company, was a carpenter and based on his past carpentry experience, he spent all day using sorghum stalks to make models and create a new type of ladder that was easy to use in combat. Many mutual aid groups have greatly demonstrated collective strength and collective wisdom in training. The Yang Hushan group, a model mutual aid group of a certain regiment, has developed new methods in ten skills and has become a model in training.

    提高杀敌技术迎接大反攻
    晋南我军加紧练兵
    【本报太岳六日电】陈赓将军所部某旅正在进行着如火如荼的大练兵运动，以迅速提高战斗技术，来迎接即将到来的大反攻。他们的口号：“那把刀子不快磨那把刀子”，某团十二连过去投弹较差，现在竟进步到平均四十一公尺。某团三连的特等射手在演习进攻时打“人头靶”，作到百发百中。搭跳板以五连的七秒钟为最快，架梯子则一般均能在二十秒钟左右架好，七连某次演习登城战斗时，从百公尺外出发，包括搭跳板架梯子，通过城墙，仅需时五分钟，他们在练兵中废食忘寝，夜以继日苦练。著名战斗英雄时来亮，在练兵前生了病，但他隐瞒着，一直领导全班练兵坚持有半个月之久。马尚智班绝大部分是解放战士，过去最落后，经过马尚智领导苦练，现在成为练兵模范。此次练兵中，另一特点是：人人发挥了自己的智慧，九连的王占胜、和汝喜，发明新的架梯方法。三连班长李建华同志，是木匠出身，就根据往年木匠的经验，一天到晚用高粱杆作模型试验创造了一种便于作战的新梯子。不少互助组，在练兵中大大发挥了集体力量和集体智勇，某团模范互助组杨虎山组，在十种技术上都研究出新办法，又成为练兵中的模范。
