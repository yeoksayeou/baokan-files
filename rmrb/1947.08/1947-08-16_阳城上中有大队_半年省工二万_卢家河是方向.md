    [This report from Taiyue] The Shangzhong United Brigade in Yangcheng, composed of six villages including Yanshan, summarized their production and war participation work from the first half of the year on July 20th. At the same time, they held commendation, evaluation, and celebration meetings. The entire United Brigade, consisting of 2,440 households across six villages, has organized 2,418 households. Eighty-six point six percent of male full laborers, fifty-five point five percent of female full laborers, eighty-two point one percent of male half laborers, and sixty-three point eight percent of female half laborers have been organized. All 758 head of livestock have been organized. The entire brigade has 25,382.6 mu of land, of which 10,323 mu are planted with grain, 6,444 mu with corn, and 1,237 mu with cotton. The autumn seedlings were weeded twice before July 5th, and the third weeding has begun in villages such as Sannanpo. In the past six months, due to organization replacing machinery, the entire United Brigade used a total of 141,290 workdays in agriculture, averaging 5.5 workdays per mu of autumn land, saving more than 22,100 workdays compared to previous years. Furthermore, they participated in three consecutive war efforts, sending a total of 391 people. Eight militiamen from Sannanpo, including Yang Yuanxing, made great contributions on the front lines. Yang Yuanxing was elected as the county's top hero. Sideline production is mainly based on spinning and weaving. The six brigades have organized 1,538 spinning women and 1,254 weaving women. They have woven more than 11,000 bolts of cloth, and 2,667 people were involved in transportation work, earning more than 53.8 million yuan, with an average sideline income of 6,880 yuan per person. According to statistics from Lujiahe, agricultural production only requires 21.4% of the total labor force, and daily household chores require 30.1%. However, due to simply accepting the call for agriculture as the primary focus, cadres did not tightly grasp the leadership of sideline production, resulting in the waste of more than 25% of the village's surplus labor. In terms of conservation and preparation for famine, they dug out 14 old wells, 71 latrines, 17 ponds, and 24 water storage pits, and stopped wasteful practices such as celebrating full months and sending off relatives, and began to collect wild vegetables. During this commendation and evaluation meeting, each brigade selected 13 male models, including Lujiahe, and 9 female models, including Bai Rusai. Among them, the seventh team of Lujiahe in Yanshan made the most contributions and had many innovations, and was rated as the model team of the entire United Brigade. Liu Yin'e, a woman from Jide, participated in an agricultural mutual aid group and worked in the fields for 113 days in half a year. Her family's 14 mu of land were all cultivated through mutual aid. She knows how to plow and can carry 70 jin, and has learned all the work that men do. She also organized ten women's mutual aid groups and cultivated Zhang Xiaozhen, a model military family woman. During the summary at the conference, Shangzhong called on everyone to learn from the models and take Lujiahe as the direction for the future.

　　阳城上中有大队
  　半年省工二万
  　卢家河是方向
    【本报太岳讯】阳城岩山等六村上中有联合大队，于七月二十日先后总结前半年生产、参战工作；同时并举行表功、评功、贺功大会。全联合大队六村共二千四百四十户，已组织起来二千四百一十八户。男全劳力组织起百分之八十六·六，女全劳力组织起百分之五十五·五，男半劳力组织起百分之八十二·一，女半劳力组织起百分之六十三·八。牲口共七百五十八犋。已百分之百组织起来。全大队共有地二万五千三百八十二亩六分，其中种谷一万零三百二十三亩、玉茭六千四百四十四亩、棉花一千二百三十七亩。秋苗已于七月五日前锄完两遍，三南坡等村三遍已经开始。半年来由于组织起来顶机器，全联合大队农业共用工十四万一千二百九十个，秋地每亩平均用工五·五个，比较往年省工二万二千一百余个。又连续参战三次，共出三百九十一人，三南坡民兵杨元兴等八人都在前线立了大功，杨元兴当选全县头名英雄。副业生产以纺织为主，六个大队共组织起纺妇一千五百三十八个、织妇一千二百五十四个。共织布一万一千余匹，以及运输工二千六百六十七个，共赚洋五千三百八十万余元，平均每人副业收入六千八百八十元。根据卢家河统计，农业生产只需全部劳力的百分之二十一·四，家庭日常零工需百分之卅·一；但由于单纯接受了农业为主的号召，干部没抓紧领导进行副业生产，使该村百分之二十五强的余工流于消耗。在节约、备荒中，掏凿旧井十四个，茅坑七十一个、泊池十七个、水囤二十四个，并停止做满月、送亲等浪费，开始采野菜。这次表功、评功，各大队选出卢家河等男模范十三个人、妇女白如赛等九个人。其中以岩山卢家河七分队立功最多，并有好多创造，被大家评为全联合大队的模范分队。吉德妇女刘银娥参加农业互助组，半年上地一百一十三天，她家十四亩地全是在互助中种的；她会犁地，能担七十斤重，一切男人做的活她都学会，并组织起十家妇女互助，培养出军属妇女模范张小真。上中有在大会总结时，号召大家向模范学习，并把卢家河作为今后的方向。
