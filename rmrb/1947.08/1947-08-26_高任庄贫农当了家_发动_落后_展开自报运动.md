　　Poor Peasants in Gao Renzhuang Take Charge
    Launching a “Backward” Self-Reporting Movement
    [Report from our newspaper in the Hebei-Shandong-Henan Border Region, 24th] During the land review in Gao Renzhuang, Seventh District of Dong'a County, after the poor peasants truly took charge, a self-reporting movement was launched. Initially, when establishing the backbone of poor peasants in the village, the classification of 42 poor peasant households and 33 middle peasant households was based solely on the composition during the democratic people's livelihood struggle, without clearly stating why it was necessary to establish a backbone of poor peasants. As a result, during the distribution of fruits of victory, the middle peasants did not understand the idea of the poor peasants taking charge, and the poor peasants did not truly take charge. After the middle peasants had taken many good things, the poor peasants held a meeting to discuss and identified the main reason: the middle peasants did not understand the poor peasants' urgent desire to fill their poverty gap. Therefore, it was decided to hold a forum with the middle peasants. At the meeting, village instructor Comrade Ren Guochang inspired everyone to discuss why it was necessary to establish a backbone of poor peasants, whether the poor peasants had completely turned over in the past, whether the poor peasants suffered losses during the distribution of fruits of victory, and whether the middle peasants benefited. Subsequently, some poor peasants said: In the past, when distributing fruits of victory, each person reached out and counted one share, and the poor suffered losses. When pricing items for distribution, the prices were lower than market prices, but the poor peasants could not afford them, so the middle peasants benefited. Some also said: When poor peasants wanted to buy some broken items, the initial price was low, but the price would increase as soon as others bid, so the good items still ended up in the hands of the middle peasants. At this point, the middle peasants also raised their concerns, saying: The poor peasants also bid up the prices. Poor peasant Zhao Jianyi said, "I bid up the price to get a weaving machine. The initial price was 130 jin of wheat, but it was bid up to 170 jin, and I took it. But even if it had been bid up to 200 jin, I would have had to take it; because once I bought a weaving machine, my family would not go hungry. I was doing it to save my life, but did the middle peasants want it to save their lives?" The middle peasants had nothing to say. Later, the poor peasants raised many facts about how the middle peasants had benefited in the past, and repeatedly explained the principle of filling the poverty gap. After the middle peasants' thinking was straightened out, they sent a representative to admit in person that they had benefited in the past, apologized to the poor peasants, and resolved to help the poor peasants fill their poverty gap in the future. After the poor peasants truly took charge, the backward were mobilized, their awareness was raised, and a self-reporting movement to claim merit was launched. A total of 25 households self-reported, worth 700,000 to 800,000 yuan.

　　高任庄贫农当了家
    发动“落后”展开自报运动
    【本报冀鲁豫二十四日电】东阿七区高任庄复查中，贫农真正当家后，展开自报运动。该庄最先在建立贫农骨干时，仅根据民主民生斗争时期的成份，划分了贫农四十二家、中农三十三家，没有明确提出为啥要树立贫农骨干。因此分果实时中农对贫农当家思想打不通，而贫农也没有真正当家，中农分去了很多好东西后，贫农召开会议讨论，找出主要原因是：中农对贫农迫切要求填起穷坑的思想打不通，于是决定和中农开座谈会。会上村指导员任国昌同志启发大家谈为啥要树立贫农骨干，过去贫农是否翻透身？分果实时贫农是否吃亏？中农是否沾光？接着有的贫农说：过去分果实伸手算一份，穷人吃亏。分东西时作价，价钱比市价低，但贫农买不起，这样中农沾了光。也有的说：贫农想买点破烂东西，本来定价低，可是一挤价就高了，好东西仍落在中农手里。这时中农也提出意见说：贫农也挤价。贫农赵见义说：“我挤价要过一个织布机。本来定价一百三十斤麦子，后来挤到一百七十斤，我要了。但即是挤到二百斤，我也得要；因为我一买到织布机，一家人就不会受饿了。我是为救命，可是中农要到家里是为的救命吗？”中农没有了话说。后来贫农又提出许多过去中农沾光的事实，并反复讲应该填贫补齐道理。中农思想打通了，便派出去个代表，当面承认过去沾了光，向贫农道歉，并决心以后帮助贫农填穷坑。贫农真正当家后，发动落后觉悟提高，展开立功自报运动。自报的共二十五家，值七八十万元。
