    Several Issues to Note in Urban Production Increase and Conservation
    (1) Issues of Production Increase and Conservation in Factories and Shops: It is good for factories and shops to establish production and conservation plans, but increasing production and saving raw materials must be combined with improving the treatment of workers and shop assistants. After lowering the standard of living, the saved items should also be appropriately handled. In the city streets, the saving of raw materials is based on an 80% labor, 20% capital profit-sharing ratio, and the saving of food is divided equally among shop assistants, workers, apprentices, and the shop owner. This satisfies both labor and capital. However, do not let the lives of workers and shop assistants become too bad, otherwise, it will affect work efficiency.
    (2) The main savings for citizens should be in reducing petty expenses. Our slogan is: "Buy oil in small quantities, buy salt in bulk, and carry less pocket money." Saving one *dou* of grain per person per month is only three to four thousand yuan, but petty expenses can easily amount to seventy to eighty thousand yuan per month if one is not careful. Reducing meals is a gradual process achieved under ideological awareness. Some streets compete to see who eats the worst and saves the most, changing three meals to two, replacing white flour with red sorghum, and replacing three meals of rice with bran and vegetables. However, because the ideology is not conscious, some secretly buy food to eat, which is actually more wasteful.
    (3) The Re-employment Issue of Snack Vendors: After the production and conservation movement started, those selling meat and alcohol, steamed buns, sesame candy, cigarettes, melon seeds, and spiced peanuts all cried out in unison: "There's no business!" They also feel that they are not capable of other lines of work and cannot start with such little capital. At this time, we should seize the opportunity to organize mutual assistance for them, conduct legitimate transportation and sales, or switch to handicrafts. Liu Hanying, a citizen of Xiadong Street, only earned five to six thousand yuan a month selling spicy soup. His wife earned more than ten thousand yuan a month weaving cloth with others. After comparing, he changed his career. He usually helps his wife weave cloth at home, and then sells spicy soup at the market.
    (4) The Leadership Issue of Street Cadres: 1. Holding "one-size-fits-all" meetings is no longer applicable. It is better to hold separate meetings, because each has its own different production. 2. Under the unprecedented enthusiasm of street cadres and the masses, we should pay more attention to following the mass line, paying attention to the ideological consciousness of the masses, and preventing disguised administrative orders and coercive work styles. For example, an activist on a certain street said: "Not formulating a production and conservation plan is not supporting Chairman Mao." One sentence caused all the masses in the street to submit their plans within two days; but in reality, it is ineffective and should be overcome. (Xingtai City *Qianjin Bao* [Forward Daily])

### 城市增产节约中应注意的几个问题

    城市增产节约中
    应注意的几个问题
    （一）工厂商店增产节约问题：工厂商店中订立生产节约计划是好的，但增产和节省原料必须与改善工人店员待遇相结合。降低生活水平后，节省的东西，也要适当处理。市街节省原料是按劳八资二分红，节省火食是店员、工人、学徒、与掌柜按人均分，这样劳资双方都满意。但不要使工人店员生活太坏，否则，影响工作效力。
    （二）市民节约主要应该是节省零化钱，我们提出口号是：“零买油，整打盐，腰中少带零花钱”。一月一人节省一斗粮食才三、四千元，零花一不注意，每月就是七八万元。下降饭食，是思想自觉下逐步作到节省，有的街比看谁吃的坏吃的省，三顿饭改为两顿，白面改红粮，三顿米改为糠菜，但因思想不自觉，有的就偷着买吃，实际就更浪费了。
    （三）卖零食的转业问题：生产节约运动开展后，卖酒肉的，卖饱子麻糖、烟卷、瓜子、卤香花生仁的，都齐声大喊：“没买卖了”！且觉的其他行不会，资本又小干不开，这时我们就应抓紧组织其互助，进行正当运销贩卖，或转向手工业。下东大街市民刘汉英，卖胡辣汤一个月仅赚五六千元，老婆与别人合伙织布，一月就赚一万多元，他比较后就改行了，平时帮老婆在家织布，遇集再卖胡辣汤。
    （四）街干部的领导问题：一、一揽子会已不适用，各开各的会好，因各有各的不同生产。二、在街干部群众空前热情下，更应十分注意走群众路线，注意群众思想自觉，防止变象的行政命令与强制作风，如某街积极分子说：“不订生产节约计划是不拥护毛主席”，一句话就使全街群众于两天内全部交上计划来；但实际上是不生效果的，应注意克服。（邢台市前进报）
