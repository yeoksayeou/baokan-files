　　In the Southern He Village Production Campaign
  　Women and Children Are Taking On Major Tasks
    Er Dong
    Southern He Village is a small village in the Eighth District of Wu'an where land reform has been relatively thorough. It has ninety-eight households, three hundred people (with over a hundred more outside the customs), and a little over ten hectares of land. There are only twenty-six male full laborers, twenty-three semi-laborers, and eight auxiliary laborers. There are fifty-seven female full laborers, thirty-eight semi-laborers, and nineteen auxiliary laborers. Female labor is exactly double that of male labor, and fifty-three households have no male labor at all, their land accounting for 42% of the village's total. Clearly, if all labor, both male and female, is not organized into agriculture, the land cannot be cultivated well.
    The merit evaluation and model selection campaign in mid-May created an ideological foundation for production: the fourteen hero models in land reform, solemnly elected by the villagers, all expressed their future efforts at the commendation conference to become production models and labor heroes, continuing to lead the masses to get rich, thus breaking the masses' fear of getting rich. Then, summarizing last year's mutual aid, it was reviewed that the advantages of last year were that many women went to the fields, and the land was not left barren. The disadvantages were that accounts were not settled, or wages were paid too slowly, only when grain prices rose; those who did not know how to work insisted on returning labor, which made others unhappy; some households had no labor and were also difficult, using other people's labor without paying wages that day, the food was bad, and they said sarcastic remarks, etc. After clearing up the past and stipulating future methods, everyone's mood was better.
    Afterwards, the production committee was organized, and labor models were commended again: such as Feng Ming's family, an eighty-two-year-old spinning expert, and young women Wang Xing'ai, Li Qi'e, etc. Li Qi'e said at the conference: "Relying on others is not being human," "Women are oppressed only because they lack skills." Women want to compete with men, and men naturally become more motivated.
    In early June, when planting cotton, sixty to seventy women who could work in the fields and many children bravely participated in the village's major labor exchange, undertaking almost all the water carrying tasks. At first, two people only carried one bucket, and the men said: "Four women are equal to one man, and they still walk slowly." The women were not convinced and gradually carried two buckets, then three buckets. After high-pitched praise from the loudspeaker, some women gritted their teeth and carried two buckets alone, simply leveling the playing field with the men. The men were responsible for guiding the water, and to avoid being unable to supply it and losing face, they enlarged the well opening, thickened the pulley, and used large cloth bags as water buckets, bringing water up from both ends, and digging two more water pits near the well to channel the water in, making it easier to scoop. Each well went from four hundred loads of water to nine hundred loads a day. The elderly, encouraged and urged by the young, also dug kilns and built kilns faster and better, so as not to be laughed at by the children.
    After ninety-two mu of cotton were planted, it was calculated that male labor only used 385 workdays, while female and child labor converted to male full labor reached 996 workdays. Li Qi'e alone carried water for eleven days straight. This was a short-term raid that everyone in the village talked about with great satisfaction, and the women were even more proud. The men could only say: "I dare not underestimate women."
    Hoeing green manure and plowing stubble was also completed in a five-day raid. But the men only worked for two days, and for the remaining three days, the men did other heavy work or carried coal and gathered firewood. It was all done by women. Afterwards, it was summarized that each man saved seven workdays. In addition, women and children also did a lot of miscellaneous work such as breaking up clods after plowing. Their slogan was: "Save male labor to gather firewood (sideline occupations)."
    When weeding seedlings came, things became complicated. But the village still did a good job. According to statistics after weeding the first time, the village used 500 fewer hired laborers (in previous years, 550 were used, but only 40 this year), saving 3,500 catties of rice. This is inseparable from the development of mutual aid, and the development of mutual aid is inseparable from the leadership of Wang Peihuai, a labor hero transformed from a turned-over hero.
    Everyone wanted to weed their own land first, fearing that it would be barren if they weeded a day or two late. Wang Peihuai discussed with the cadres and the masses and re-formed the groups into small groups of three or five households, ensuring that they could walk through three households' land every morning, forenoon, and afternoon. Someone said: "If I weed other people's land in the morning and it rains in the afternoon, my land will suffer." He mobilized Party members to play an exemplary role and weed for others first; at the same time, he came up with general methods such as weeding for families with less land or fewer people first, so that mutual aid could progress smoothly.
    Families without women were unwilling to engage in mutual aid with women, fearing that they would not stand firmly and would damage the land. Wang Peihuai's family had women, so he sought mutual aid with families with women such as Li Shuxun's family, and if they were to get back injuries, they would all get a little back injury. Everyone followed him to learn, solving a part of the problem. In addition, women without men also combined themselves into a part.
    Women and children did not understand when to weed, how deep or shallow to weed. Wang Peihuai would tell them every two or three days, and inform them of urgent matters at any time. He mobilized men to teach them at any time and anywhere, taking one step forward with alternating left and right legs, not stepping randomly, weeding steadily, and not weeding out seedlings. He himself patrolled everywhere at noon every day, looking at the quality of the weeding, whether there were any problems. Women called him here and there in the morning and afternoon, and he responded and went, answering them "weeded correctly," "incorrectly," "a little shallower," "leave a little sparser," and so on. Some women and children became pessimistic because they did not weed well and did not want to do it anymore. He went to mobilize them again. If some really couldn't hold on, he told them to rest for half a day or a day and work again when they were better. But he commended those who persisted every day, making everyone consciously persist. Some families had children or urgent work and had to go back, without mechanically restricting them, making everyone feel that mutual aid only had advantages and no disadvantages.
    Here, a complex problem of recording and converting workdays arose: men, women, old, young, and labor had different strengths, the length of working time, the quality and quantity were different, and simple labor exchange methods were not feasible. After everyone's discussion, scoring was implemented. For example, women initially only earned four or five points, but later some developed to weed as well and as fast as men, and were rated as full labor (ten points); children initially only earned one-quarter or one-third, but recently some have done four-fifths of adults, and were counted as eight points. Some young and middle-aged people only knew how to study and do business, and were not good at farm work, so they were only recorded as five or six points. Everyone felt it was very fair, but recording and calculating accounts was too troublesome, so they learned from the old areas and issued each family one hundred work tickets and started using them. At this point, the mutual aid in Southern He Village developed to a consolidated stage. Every day at mealtime, the masses gathered in the streets to discuss who to work for in the next shift and the next day, and how to do it, which was very exciting.
    In addition, some widowed and laborless households could not afford to pay wages in rice, so the village helped them form a small textile factory, and the village cooperative collected their cloth and thread every three days and paid wages once, so that they had rice to use at any time. Women, after this year's training, can now do everything except operate seeders and plows. Some time ago, it was calculated that planting one mu of grain and wheat (two seasons of autumn and summer), one mu of cotton, one mu of corn, and one mu of mung beans requires a total of thirty-six workdays, of which twenty can be done by women. There has been no calculation recently, and the actual development will exceed this number. For example, during the rush planting in early August, two women could already operate seeders, and the seedlings that came out were about the same as those operated by men.

　　南贺庄生产运动中
  　妇女儿童顶了大事
    而东
    南贺庄是武安八区一个土地改革比较彻底的小村，九十八户，三百人口（另有一百多口在关外），十顷多地。男全劳力只有二十六个，半劳力二十三个，辅助劳力八个。女全劳力五十七个，半劳力三十八个，辅助劳力十九个。女劳力恰为男劳力二倍，有五十三户根本没男劳力，其土地占全村百分之四十二。显然，不把所有劳力连男带妇都组织到农业中来，地就无法种好。
    五月中旬的评功表模运动，给生产创造了思想基础：全村群众郑重选举的十四位土地改革中的英雄模范，都在贺功大会上表示了自己今后的努力方向，就是要做生产模范、劳动英雄，继续领导群众发家致富，这样打破了群众的怕富情绪。接着总结去年互助，检讨到去年的好处是有不少妇女下地，没荒了地。缺点是没结帐；或工资偿付得太慢，粮食涨价了才付；不会做活的硬还工，别人不高兴；有些户既无劳力又尖头，用了人家工当天不开工资，饭又坏，还说凉话等。清理了过去，规定好以后办法，大家情绪就更好些。
    以后组织生产委员会，又表扬了一次劳动模范：如八十二岁的纺花能手凤鸣家，年青妇女王兴艾、李其娥等。李其娥在大会上说：“靠人过不算人，”“女人受欺压，只为本领差。”妇女要和男人比，男人自然也更带劲。
    六月初点种棉花，六七十个能下地的妇女和许多儿童都奋勇参加了全村大变工，担任了几乎全部的抬水任务。开始两人只抬一桶，男人们说：“四个妇女顶一个男人，还走的慢。”妇女不服，渐渐抬两桶，抬三桶。广播筒高声大嚷的表扬之后，有些妇女就咬咬牙一人挑两桶，干脆和男人秤平了。男人们担任着拐水任务，为了不至供不上挑丢人，把井口放大，辘辘加粗，用大布袋当水桶，两头上水，井附近另挖两个水坑，把水贯进去，使舀水方便。每井一天从四百担水出到九百担。老年人受着年青人鼓舞催促，刨窑盖窑也做得更快更好些，免叫孩子们笑话。
    九十二亩棉花点完后计算，男工只用了三八五个，女工童工折成的男全工竟达到九九六个，光李其娥一人一气担了十一天。这是村里人人谈起来非常满意的一次短期突击，妇女们更是洋洋得意。男人也只好说：“就是不敢小看女人。”
    刨青（草）刨茬又是五天突击完成。但男人只做了两天，其余三天，男人都做别的重活或驮煤拾砍去了，全是女人干。事后总结，男人每人省工七个。此外，犁地后的打圪塔等杂活，妇女儿童也做得很多，她们的口号是：“省出男工去拾砍（副业）。”
    锄苗到来时，事情复杂起来。但该村仍然做的很好，仅头遍苗锄完后统计，全村少用短工五百个（往年用五百五，今年只用四十个），省米三千五百斤。这和互助的发展是分不开的，而互助的发展，又是和翻身英雄转化来的劳动英雄王培槐同志的领导是分不开的。
    大家谁也愿意先锄自己地，怕晚锄一两天荒了。王培槐就和干部群众共同商量，把组重结一下，弄成三家五家的小组，保证每天早晨、上午、下午可以走三家地。有人说：“前晌锄了人家地，后晌下雨，俺地就苦了。”他一面动员党员起模范作用，尽先给别人锄；一面又想出先给地少的或人少的人家锄等一般办法，使互助顺利进展。
    家里无女人的，不愿和女人互助，怕她们站不稳，踏坏地，王培槐家有女人，就找李树勋等有女人的家庭互助起来，要背伤都背点伤，大家便跟着他学，解决了一部分。另外，没男人的妇女也自己结合一部分。
    妇女儿童们不懂得几时该锄，该深该浅，王培槐隔三两天给说说，有要紧事随时告知。动员男人随时随地教她们，左右腿一替一步往前走，不要乱踏，把稳锄，不要锄掉苗。他自己每天午间到处巡游，看看锄的好坏，有无毛病。前后晌妇女们这儿喊他，那儿叫他，他都应声而往，回答她们“锄得对”，“不对”，“再浅点”，“再留稀点”等等。有些妇女儿童因为锄得不好，悲观起来，不想干了，他重新去动员。有的实在顶不下来，便关照她们休息半天、一天，好了再干。但每天表扬坚持不懈的，使大家自觉起来坚持。有的家里有孩子或紧活，非回去不可，不机械限制，使大家觉得互助只有好处没坏处。
    这儿就出现一个复杂的记工折工问题：男女老少劳力不同，做活时间长短，好坏多少不同，简单的变工还工办法不行了，就经过大家讨论，开始实行评分。比如，妇女开始只顶四、五分，以后竟有一部分发展到和男人锄得一样好，一样快了，便评为全工（十分）；儿童开始只顶四分之一或三分之一，最近也有做到大人五分之四的了，便照八分计。有些青壮年只会读书经商，庄稼活很不行，也只按活记五、六分。大家觉得很公平，就是记帐算帐太麻烦，于是又学习老区办法，一家发了一百分工票，开始使用起来。至此，南贺庄的互助发展到了巩固的阶段。每天饭时群众聚集街头，商量下一晌、下一天给谁干、怎样干，非常起劲。
    此外，有些孤寡无劳力户出不起工资米，村里帮她们组成一个小型纺织工厂，由村合作社三天收一次她们的布和线，发一次工资，使她们有米随时用工。妇女们经过今年的锻炼，现在除摇耧扶犁之外，其他一切活妇女都能干了。前些时计算：种一亩谷麦（秋夏两季）一亩棉花、一亩玉茭、一亩绿豆，共需人工三十六个，其中有二十个都是妇女可以做的。最近没有再计算，实际的发展将超过这个数字，如八月初抢种中，已有妇女二人会摇耧，出的苗也与男人摇的差不多。
