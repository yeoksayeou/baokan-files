    Chiang Kai-shek's Bandit Gang Sabotages the Dangerous Works in Kunshan
    Yu Cun
    During the peach blossom flood season at the end of March this year, the Kunshan Democratic Government on the south bank of the Yellow River organized the masses in the guerrilla area to intensify the reconstruction of the embankment. At that time, a battalion of Chiang Kai-shek's 72nd Division was stationed near the large and small river embankments and arrested embankment workers all day long. In Kongnatun Village alone, nine people were arrested and thrown into the river to drown in one instance. The local people in the Chiang-controlled area had no choice but to send gentryman Song Qin＠ to the Chiang Kai-shek county government in Dongping on April 4 to petition, requesting permission for the people to repair the embankment and save themselves. However, after going there, he was detained and his life or death is still unknown. Later, Zhao Laotou was sent to Da Xiao Qiao to request the Chiang army battalion commander to suspend shooting at the embankment workers, but he was also refused. The commander said, "The Yellow River will be useful in the future (referring to breaching the embankment to flood the liberated areas); if you insist on repairing it, I will not be responsible if you are shot dead!" Soon, the peach blossom floods surged, and the embankment there was washed away by the water and was on the verge of collapse. The 180,000 people of Kunshan were facing imminent disaster and were all distressed and stomping their feet. The masses in villages such as Sunlou secretly transported stones to our engineering team for emergency repairs. However, the battalion commander of Da Xiao Qiao even convened a village head meeting, threatening the masses, saying, "If any village dares to take stones to repair the embankment again, I will use a machine gun to target it!" Fortunately, the People's Liberation Army crossed the river and drove away the enemy from Da Xiao Qiao shortly afterwards, leading the emergency repairs. The masses were overjoyed, and as many as 16,000 people voluntarily participated, with more than 1,000 carts. In a few days, they transported 4,400 cubic meters of stone, 820,000 catties of straw, and 3,500 wooden stakes, completing 110,000 cubic meters of earthwork. This blocked the peach blossom flood, saving the lives and property of hundreds of thousands of people. Just as the democratic government continued to organize the people to start emergency repairs on the dangerous works to prevent major floods, 55 soldiers of Chiang Kai-shek's army came again on June 6 and set up a stronghold in Xiaowangzha, building bunkers and arresting people along the Yellow River north to Shilibu. The democratic government had no choice but to organize the masses to secretly transport stone and sorghum straw at night to rush repairs on the dangerous works there. However, the enemy burned sorghum straw wherever they saw it. Our engineering team members Zhang Yinglin, Xu Guangcai, and Xu Chunshan were captured by the enemy during the rush repairs and their whereabouts are still unknown. At that time, the masses remembered the suffering of the temporary breach in the 24th year of the Republic (1935), when they had to beg for food for eight years before returning home. If a breach occurred there, not only Kunshan, but also millions of people in eighteen counties including Dongping, Wenshang, Jining, and even Xuzhou, would suffer. They were completely desperate.
    On the evening of June 30, our army crossed the river southward and drove away the enemy. The democratic government quickly organized embankment repairs again, and the masses saw hope again. Everyone cheered, "Heavens! Our army has come, we can repair the embankment with peace of mind!" Therefore, villages dedicated stones to rush the repairs in full swing. The first district dedicated more than 10,000 cubic meters, and Xijinshan Village alone dedicated 4,000 cubic meters. Women in Huazhuang even dismantled their chicken coops to donate. Twenty thousand civilians, more than two thousand carts, and countless small carts, led by two-thirds of the cadres in the county, worked day and night. The sound of throwing stones and ramming could be heard several miles away. In more than ten days, they transported 7,500 cubic meters of stone, 450,000 catties of straw, 270,000 catties of branches, and 4,500 wooden stakes, completing 25,000 cubic meters of earthwork.
    However, Chiang Kai-shek's bandit gang never stopped sabotaging. From July 1, airplanes strafed in turn every day, up to nine times a day. On July 18 alone, Chiang Kai-shek's bandits bombed and killed four civilians, including Xue Fanzou, and wounded eighteen people, including Ma Shengqi, and killed twenty-two stone-transporting cattle and wounded twenty-one cattle, and destroyed six carts. The project suffered huge obstacles. All the tragedies were created by Chiang Kai-shek's bandit gang, and all the retribution and punishment will be concentrated on Chiang Kai-shek's bandit gang!

    蒋贼破坏中的昆山险工
    余村
    今年三月底桃汛期，黄河南岸昆山民主政府组织游击区群众加紧复提，当时蒋贼七十二师一个营盘踞大小的河堤附近，整天四出抓捕堤工，孔那囤一村，一次即被捕去投在河中淹死九人。当地蒋占区群众不得已于四月四日伪派士绅宋芹＠赴东平蒋记县府请愿，要求允许老百姓修堤自救，但去后即被扣押，至今生死不明。后又派赵老头赴大小乔请求蒋军营长暂停扫射堤工，亦遭拒绝，并说：“黄河将来还有用哩（指决口淹没解放区）；你们硬要修，被打死我不负责！”不久，桃泛汹涌，在那里堤岸被水冲击，摇摇欲坠，昆山十八万人民身临灭顶大祸，莫不疾首顿足，孙楼等村群众即秘密运石给我工程队进行抢修。而大小乔连军营长竟又召开村长会，恐吓群众说：“那个村要再拿石头修堤，我用机枪点他的名！”幸不久解放军渡河赶走大小乔敌人，领导抢修，群众欢天喜地，自动参加者达一万六千人，大车千余辆，在几天中，运石四千四百方，秸料八十二万斤，木桩三千五百根，完成土工十一万方。挡住了桃泛大水，数百万人命财产得救。正当民主政府继续组织人民动工抢修险工以防大泛时，六月六日蒋军五十五人又来了，在小王扎下据点，大修碉堡，沿黄河到十里堡以北，见人就抓。民主政府只得组织群众黑夜秘运石料秫秸，抢修在那里险工，但敌在那里见秫秸就烧，我工程队员张英林、许光才、徐春山等四人并在抢修中被敌捕去，至今无着。当时群众想起了二十四年临时决口时的苦难日子，要饭八年才回了家，假若在那里决了口，不但昆山，连东平、汶上、济宁直到徐州等十八县数百万余人，均将罹难，他们完全陷于绝望中了。
    六月三十日晚，我军渡河南下，打走了敌人。民主政府并又迅即组织修堤，群众重新看到了希望。大家欢呼：“天啦！咱的军队来了，咱能安心修堤了！”于是各村献石抢修热火朝天，一区献了一万多方，西金山一村即献了四千方，华庄妇女把鸡窝都拆来献了。两万民夫、两千多辆大车，无数的小车，在全县三分之二的干部率领下，昼夜抢修，抛石打击之声，数里外可闻。在十余天内，运石七千五百方，秸料四十五万斤，枝条二十七万斤，木桩四千五百根，作土工二万五千方。
    但蒋贼破坏是始终未停止的，从七月一日起，每天飞机轮番扫射，多至一天九次。仅七月十八日一天，蒋贼在国那里险工，即炸死民夫薛范奏等四人，炸伤马升起等十八人，炸死运石牛二十二头，伤牛二十一头，毁大车六辆。工程遭受巨大阻碍，一切惨祸是蒋贼制造的，一切的报应与惩罚亦将集中于蒋贼！
