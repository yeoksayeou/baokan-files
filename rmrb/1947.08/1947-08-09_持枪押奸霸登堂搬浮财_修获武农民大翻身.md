    Holding Guns, Pressing Down on Traitors and Despots, Ascending Halls to Move Ill-Gotten Wealth
    Repairing, Obtaining, and Arming Farmers, Achieving a Great Turnaround
    [This newspaper's Huojia dispatch] The Xiu (Wu) Huo (Jia) Wu (Zhi) area has been ravaged by Chiang's troops for nearly two years. It was liberated in the Daqing campaign last month. When our army advanced into the area, the farmers, with expressions of surprise, shouted to the crowds who had been frightened, deceived, and scattered into the fields by spies and special agents, "Come back! Our own people have arrived!" So men, women, old, and young, came back in groups, surrounding the soldiers and asking questions as if they had met long-lost relatives. When Comrade Li Yushuan arrived in Xizhangju Village, people rushed to shake his hand, and many shed tears of mixed sorrow and joy. Many children touched the things on his body, their small eyes looking at him, wanting to know something from his mouth, or wanting to tell him something. An old lady said with tears in her eyes, "Ah! Savior, you have finally arrived!" The farmers cooperated with our work with unparalleled enthusiasm. They carried spears and guns to escort traitors and despots. The masses in Chengfeng escorted more than sixty at once, and none escaped. They constantly brought new people to participate in training classes. For example, the training class opened in Beidada Duanjidian (three villages) started with only one hundred and fifty people, but eventually increased to four or five hundred. After the short training, the movement to seal off and confiscate the property of traitors, despots, and landlords quickly unfolded in more than twenty villages. More than ninety percent of the farmers were involved in the movement, happily busy distributing and vying for goods. Many people even forgot to eat. During the struggle in Xuying, gunshots rang out constantly five miles away, but people didn't seem to care much. Hundreds and thousands of people constantly went to and from the homes of traitors, despots, and landlords, carrying grain, clothing, furniture, and chickens and ducks. An old man in Chengfeng said: He had never worn a long robe in his life and asked for a long robe to wear. Everyone gave him a robe, and he put it on immediately, happily shouting, "I won't regret it even if I die now. Sending letters and scouting news is all my business." (Liang Xinming)

    持枪押奸霸登堂搬浮财
    修获武农民大翻身
    【本报获嘉讯】修（武）获（嘉）武（陟）地区遭蒋军蹂躏将近二年之久，上月道清战役中获得解放，当我军挺进该区时，农民们以惊喜的神情，呼喊着被奸特吓唬欺骗而散躲在田野的人群“都回来啊！自己的人来了”！于是男女老少，一群一群走了回来，围摆着战士们像见了久别的亲人一样问长道短。李玉拴同志一到西张巨村，人们争着给他握手，不少人流下悲喜交集的眼泪，许多孩子们摸着他身上的东西，一双小眼望着他，想从他嘴里知道什么事情，或者想要告诉他什么事似的，一位老太太含着泪说：“呀！救命的恩人，你可来了！”农民们热情无比的配合我们工作，他们背上矛子枪押送奸霸，程封群众一下就押送了六十多名，一个也没跑。他们不断带来新的群众参加训练班，如北大段基点（三个村）开的训练班，开始只一百五十人，最后竟增加到四五百名。短训后，对奸霸豪绅地主的封门抄家运动，很快即在二十多个村子展开。百分之九十以上的农民都卷入运动，喜气洋洋忙着分，争着要，许多人连饭都顾不上吃。徐营斗争时，五里外枪声不断响，但人们似乎不大在意，成百成千的群众，来往不断的去奸霸地主家中搬运粮食、衣物、家具和鸡鸭。程封一个老汉说：一辈子没穿过大袍，要求分个大袍穿，大家给了他一个袍子，他当时就穿上，高兴的叫起来说：“以后死了亦不后悔，送信探消息都是我的事。”（梁心明）
