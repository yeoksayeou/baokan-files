　　Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 23rd -- Industries in Tianjin and other Chiang-controlled areas are collapsing one after another. According to Tianjin newspapers, over a hundred machine-weaving factories in Tianjin have all ceased operations due to a lack of raw materials and reduced production, resulting in unbearable losses and inability to continue business. Thousands of workers in the industry have been plunged into unemployment. From January to June this year, the Desheng Pottery Factory in Tangshan suffered losses of over 650 million yuan. The cost of producing a teapot at the factory is 16,000 yuan, but it sells for 13,000 yuan, and even then there are no customers. As a result, the factory is unable to sustain itself and has decided to suspend operations, leaving over three hundred workers unemployed.

    【新华社陕北二十三日电】天津等地工业纷纷倒闭。据天津报载：津市百余家机织业工厂均因原料缺乏，生产减低，致赔累不堪，无力经营，上月下旬已俱行歇业，该业工人千人陷于失业惨境。唐山德盛窑业厂自今年一月至六月，赔累达六亿五千余万元。该厂出产之茶壶成本须一万六千元，售出一万三千元尚无主顾，致该厂无法维持，已决定停工，该厂三百余工人亦陷于失业。
