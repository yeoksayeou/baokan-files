　　Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 15th: Washington dispatch: The Anglo-American Ruhr coal mine conference, delayed by Britain for three weeks, convened in Washington on the 12th at the insistence of the United States. According to a US State Department spokesman on the 8th, the conference is limited to technical methods of increasing Ruhr coal production. Issues such as steel production will be dealt with at the next conference. The British proposal on the financial problems of the Anglo-American occupation zones is also not on the agenda. Contrary to the "optimism" expressed by senior US officials on the day the conference opened, "British officials stated that they did not believe a reliable method could be found at the meeting. The British attitude is that the increase in coal production depends on the resolution of certain fundamental issues in occupation affairs – such as financial burdens, food, and transportation." (Associated Press, 12th)
    　　Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 15th: Comprehensive report: The convening of the US-British Ruhr coal production conference, which abandons the Potsdam Agreement, is a practical step by US imperialism to monopolize Europe. Because to control Europe, it is necessary to first control the driving force for European industrial recovery – the Ruhr coal production in the British occupation zone. (In 1940, 70 percent of Germany's 190 million tons of coal production came from the Ruhr, supplying three-quarters of German industry and half of the coal needed by European industry.) But this conference went through several twists and turns, being postponed for three weeks, during which the United States, Britain, and France staged a tense and complex struggle. When Britain, mired in an economic crisis, actively campaigned for the "Marshall Plan," the United States took the opportunity to present Britain with the "Ruhr Plan" around July 17th, declaring the Ruhr as the cornerstone of the "Marshall Plan," directly demanding that Britain relinquish control of the Ruhr, and openly threatening: "Either accept the 'Ruhr Plan' or abandon hope of obtaining assistance under the 'Marshall Plan.'" It also proposed immediately convening a US-British Ruhr coal production conference in late July. On the one hand, the British government feared three things: first, the failure of its original attempt (to use the Ruhr as part of its economy to save the decline of the British Empire); second, the resurgence of Germany threatening its pursuit of leadership in Western Europe; and third, the pressure of public opinion and the loss of support from trade unions. On the other hand, it was reluctant to give up the "further assistance of the Marshall Plan" (Attlee's words) to save its economic difficulties. Therefore, it adopted a delaying policy towards the conference, while expressing "indignation and panic" at 10 Downing Street and colluding with France to argue with the United States. At the same time, it released an atmosphere of "placing hope on the November Foreign Ministers Conference" to ease public opinion and bargain with the United States. Under these circumstances, the United States used another set of tricks, with "superficial concessions," to ensure that the fish it had hooked would not escape. Thus, on August 4th, the United States indicated that it was considering relaxing loan conditions and could grant Britain a new short-term loan. On the 6th, the day Attlee's "economic war" was announced, Marshall himself personally stepped forward to hastily announce that loan conditions could be relaxed and implemented without Congressional approval. On the 9th, he made a formal concession on Britain's insistence on France's attendance at the Anglo-American conference to discuss the level of German industry; the Anglo-American Ruhr coal production conference was then announced to open on the 12th. However, the arrangement of the conference program shows that the United States' so-called concession is a strategy of "putting the rope on first." It wants Britain to first hold a meeting to accept the US Ruhr plan, and then hold other meetings to relax loan conditions.
    　　Current signs prove that Anglo-American relations after the conference remain extremely complex; according to Agence France-Presse, London, 11th, London has issued a warning: "The implementation of the Marshall Plan will be impossible until the issues raised in these conferences (referring to the Ruhr coal production, revision of US-British loan conditions, and the level of German industry, etc.) are satisfactorily resolved."

### 美国独占鲁尔控制欧洲　鲁尔煤产会议揭幕英美关系仍极复杂

　　美国独占鲁尔控制欧洲
  　鲁尔煤产会议揭幕英美关系仍极复杂
    【新华社陕北十五日电】华盛顿讯：由英国拖延达三周之久的英美鲁尔煤矿会议，在美国坚持下，已于十二日在华盛顿召开。据八日美国务院发言人称：此次会议仅限于技术方法增加鲁尔煤产问题，至于钢产等问题，则将留待下次会议处理。英方所提之英美占领区财政问题也不在议题之列。在会议召开之日，与美国高级官员所表示的“乐观”相反，“英方官员表示他们并不以为在会上可以找出一确实可靠的方法。英国的态度是增加煤产问题要看占领事务上某些基本问题——如财政负担、粮食及运输等问题的解决而定。”（美联社十二日电）
    【新华社陕北十五日电】综合报导：毁弃波茨顿协定的美英鲁尔煤产会议之召开，乃是美帝国主义独霸欧洲的一个实际步骤。因为欲控制欧洲，必先控制欧洲工业所赖以复兴的动力——英占领区的鲁尔煤产。（一九四○年德国煤产一千九百万吨的百分之七十出自鲁尔，它供给德国工业四分之三及欧洲工业所需煤量的一半。）但这一会议曾几经波折，延期三周之久，其间美英法三国曾表演了一幕紧张而复杂的斗争。当英国困于经济危机出而为“马歇尔计划”积极奔波时，美国乃趁机在七月十七日左右向英国提出了“鲁尔计划”，宣布鲁尔是“马歇尔计划”的基石，率直要求英国让出鲁尔控制权，公然要胁：“或者接受‘鲁尔计划，’或者放弃从‘马歇尔计划’下取得援助的希望。”并提出立即于七月下旬初召开美英两国鲁尔煤产会议。英政府对此一方面具有三怕，一怕其原来企图（以鲁尔为其经济一部分以挽救大英帝国的颓势）之破灭；二怕德国再起致威胁其所追逐的西欧领导权；三怕舆论的压力与失掉工会的支持；另一方面又恋恋于“马歇尔计划的进一步援助”（艾德礼语）以拯救其经济困难。因此对会议采取拖延政策，同时在唐宁街十号的办公桌前大表“愤激与惊慌，”并拉拢法国一起向美国争吵。同时放出“要寄希望于十一月四外长会议”等空气，来缓和舆论与向美国讨价还价。在此情况下，美国则要了又一套花枪，以“表面的让步”，务使其已上钩的鱼不致有脱钩而去的危险。于是八月四日美国表示已在考虑放宽贷款条件，并可予英国以新的短期贷款；六日艾德礼“经济战争”宣布之日，马歇尔并亲自出马急急宣布贷款条件可以放宽，并可不经国会通过即付实行。九日他并对英国所坚持的法国出席英美会议以讨论德国工业水平问题作了形式的让步；英美鲁尔煤产会议这才于十二日宣布开幕。但从这次会议程序的安排，显示美国之所谓让步是“把绳子先套上再说”的一种策略，他要英国先开会接受美国鲁尔计划，然后再举行放宽贷款条件的其他会议。
    目前迹象证明：会议召开后之英美关系，仍极度复杂；据法新社伦敦十一日电，伦敦已发出预告：“在这几次会议（指鲁尔煤产、修改美英贷款条件及德国工业水平等会）中提出的问题圆满解决前，马歇尔计划之实行将是不可能的。”
