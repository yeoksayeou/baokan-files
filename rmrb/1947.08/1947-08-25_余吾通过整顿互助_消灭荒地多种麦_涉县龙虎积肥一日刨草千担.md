　　【Report from this newspaper】In Yuwu, Tunliu, 525 peasant households suffered from enemy and puppet destruction, resulting in a reduction of labor and a lot of land lying waste. Recently, all cadres responded to the government's call for "long-term focus, increasing production to prepare for famine." All 218 mu of wasteland was completely and thoroughly eliminated through inspection and consolidation of all 27 mutual aid teams in the village. A portion was planted with late autumn and late vegetables such as rapeseed, mustard greens, turnips, buckwheat, and beans, while most was plowed and planted with wheat. The eight mutual aid teams in Southwest Street alone eliminated 56 mu, and Xu Zhanhua's team in West Street eliminated 12 mu. Miao Dazui, an old man of 68 in North Street, eliminated 5 mu on his own. This work was also difficult to start with, and the masses reflected: "Labor is difficult to manage, the land is far away, the cost is high, and the yield is low." However, after consolidating the mutual aid teams, everyone discussed and proposed: "Eliminating wasteland and planting more wheat is more profitable than collecting wild vegetables." It was also stipulated that distant wasteland would not be burdened for three years and would not be rented out for three years; near-ripe wasteland would not be burdened for one year and would not be rented out for two years. This sparked a competition, with "each street managing its own street, guaranteeing complete elimination"; the cooperative guaranteed to solve the seed problem, so in just over ten days, the wasteland was completely eliminated. In Dulu Village, Fourth District, the entire village was mobilized to eliminate 901 mu of ripe wasteland, which has generally been hoeed three times. They are now actively plowing wheat land and cutting artemisia to accumulate fertilizer. In the nine key villages of Lu Village, Second District, 251 mu of ripe wasteland have been eliminated in the production increase movement. They are now actively accumulating fertilizer, and the first plowing of the wheat land has been completed. (Tunliu Peasants)
　　
　　【Report from this newspaper】Wang Wenhua, labor hero of Longhu Village, Third District of She County, together with the branch secretary and other cadres, took advantage of the rainy weather on the 15th of this month to convene a meeting of all village work team leaders and mutual aid team leaders to study fertilizer accumulation. First, they pointed out that the Beginning of Autumn had passed, and the Autumn Equinox was approaching, proposing "wheat enters the soil at the Autumn Equinox" according to the season. In addition, there was a lack of labor this year, and there was very little manure in the fields. This statement sparked a lot of discussion. For example, Wang Zhong, a peasant who had been emancipated, said: "Hoeing the ground is very wet now, and it saves labor to take advantage of the weather and the free time, so we can make fertilizer." After discussion, it was decided that since the artemisia had not yet grown, digging grass sod was an opportunity. After the discussion, the cadres took the lead and organized 54 laborers into small groups of three to five people to dig grass sod in the fields. Broadcasting was carried out in the evening, and more than a thousand loads of sod were dug in one day. (Kuaimiao Small Newspaper)

　　余吾通过整顿互助
  　消灭荒地多种麦
  　涉县龙虎积肥一日刨草千担
    【本报讯】屯留余吾农户五百二十五家，因受过敌伪摧残，劳力减少，荒芜土地很多。最近全体干部响应政府号召：“长期着眼，增产备荒。”把所有二百一十八亩荒地，通过检查整顿了全村二十七个互助组，完全彻底消灭。一部分种上油菜、芥菜、蔓菁、荞麦、豆子等晚秋晚菜，大部分犁过种麦。只西南街八个互助组即消灭五十六亩，西街许占华一组即消灭了十二亩，北街六十八岁一个老汉苗大嘴，独自消灭了五亩。这个工作开始也很不好做，群众反映：“劳力困难顾不来，地远本重产量少”。但是经过整顿互助组，大家讨论提出：“消灭荒地多种麦，比打野菜得利大。”并又规定远荒地三年不负担，三年不出租，近熟荒一年不负担，二年不出租；这样掀起竞赛，“各街管各街，保证消灭完”；合作社保证解决种籽困难，所以前后十多天，把荒地完全消灭了。四区杜村，全村总动员，消灭熟荒九百零一亩，一般都已锄过三遍，现正积极普犁麦地，割蒿积肥。二区路村基点九个村，在增产运动中消灭熟荒二百五十一亩，现正积极积肥，麦地头遍已经犁完。（屯留农民）
    【本报讯】涉县三区龙虎村劳动英雄王文华，同支部书记等干部，在本月十五号，趁着下雨时间，召开全村拨工队长、互助组长会议，研究积肥，首先提出立秋已过，秋分不久到来，按季节提出“秋分麦入土”，加上今年劳力缺乏，地里粪土很少。这样一提，大家乱扯起来。如翻身农民王忠说：现在锄地很湿，趁天趁空又省工，咱可以闹粪。大家研究后，蒿未长起，只有刨草坯是个机会。讨论后，干部带头，组织了五十四个劳力，三五人成立小组，到地刨草坯，晚上进行广播，一天即刨坯一千余担。（快苗小报）
