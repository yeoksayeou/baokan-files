　　【Benbao Ji'nan 19th dispatch】Hengshui Zhao Village Farmers' Association Director Han Mengchang, held a family meeting the other day to discuss increasing production and preparing for famine. His family of four, with twenty-three mu of land, can harvest 4,320 jin of grain annually. The family of four needs 4,880 jin of rice for food, vegetables, lamp oil, and firewood, leaving a deficit of 380 jin, which they decided to make up from sideline occupations. The division of labor is as follows: Mengchang is responsible for motivating the whole family and taking the lead in field and housework. His wife, Zhifang, in addition to participating in farm work during the wheat harvest and weeding, spins thread in the winter and spring. She gets half a jin of rice for every ounce of thread spun. The eldest son, Dianbo (16 years old), has a standard of plowing two mu per day; he gets 200 yuan for each additional mu plowed. In the winter and spring, he hauls saltpeter, yams, and grain; the money earned is divided into shares: one share for the livestock, one share for the individual, and one share for the whole family. Harrowing is based on a standard of five mu per day; he gets ten ocean dollars for each additional mu harrowed. The second son, Dianxiang (12 years old), can only do light work. His standard is cutting twenty jin of grass per day; he gets 50 yuan for each additional twenty jin cut. He gets ten yuan for carrying a basket of manure for the livestock pen and five yuan for a basket of dirt to pad the livestock pen. During winter and spring school days, he gets twenty yuan for each basket of manure picked up, and he splits firewood 50/50 in the winter (half for the family, half for himself). As for clothing, because Dianxiang is young, he is provided with half, and everyone else is responsible for their own. After this discussion and decision, everyone's production enthusiasm was very high. Currently, it is not raining, and the seedlings are about to die from drought, so the whole family is rushing to plant vegetables and radishes to prepare for famine.

  　实行奖励推动增产
    【本报冀南十九日电】衡水赵家庄农会主任韩孟长，日前开家庭会，讨论增产备荒。他家四口人，二十三亩地，全年可收粮食四千三百二十斤，四人吃饭、吃菜、灯油、烧柴得用米四千八百八十斤，所差三百八十斤，决定从副业上补。分工是孟长推动全家，带头做地里、家里活。他老婆志芳除过麦秋参加农活和锄苗外，冬春两季纺线，纺一两线子给半斤米。大儿殿博（十六岁）每天耕二亩为标准，多耕一亩给二百元。冬春两季拉硝盐、山药、粮食，赚的钱按牲口一股，个人一股，全家一股分。耙地每天耙五亩为标准，多耙一亩给洋十元。二儿殿向（十二岁）只能干轻活，每天割二十斤草为标准，多割二十斤给钱五十元，背一筐牲口棚的粪给十元，一筐土垫牲口棚给他五元。冬春上学当中每拾一筐粪给二十元，冬天拾柴对半分（家里、个人各半）。衣服问题，因殿向年岁小，供给他一半，别人一概自己解决。这样讨论决定后，每个人的生产情绪十分高涨。目下天不下雨，小苗将要旱死，全家都在抢种小菜、萝卜备荒。
