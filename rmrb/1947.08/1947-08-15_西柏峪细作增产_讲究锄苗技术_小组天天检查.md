　　【Report from the newspaper in Licheng】Xibayu hero Liu Entang personally led 64 technicians from various teams in the village to study weeding, topdressing fertilizer, sowing vegetables, and pruning cotton on the 4th of this month. Li Congxi said, "We must distinguish between good and bad skills and implement rewards for techniques to improve techniques. Now the cotton branches are growing very long, and if you are not careful, you will knock down the fruit branches. When weeding, you can't use the long hoe like before; you have to bend down and hold the hoe handle." Li Laohu said, "Now, if the corn is to grow quickly, it must be topdressed again. When topdressing, you must dig two small ditches under the leaves on both sides of the corn and irrigate both sides with manure, so as not to waste the fertilizer and apply it all to the corn ears." Liu Entang said, "It has just rained heavily, and the cotton bollworms are developing. In a few days, it will be overgrown. Each team must have a special person to lead the women to carefully prune the cotton. If you want to improve your skills, you must always inspect the fields." Everyone unanimously proposed: Each team should inspect the fields during breaks, and it was decided to conduct a general inspection of the whole village in ten days, with daily inspections by the groups. After such study, everyone realized that technology is the main condition for increasing production. Now, each team studies technology during breaks in the fields, and agricultural technology in the whole village has been greatly improved. (Deming, Chongqi, Xinwen, Jianwen)

　　【Report from the newspaper in Licheng】Qiushuyuan Branch Secretary Li Chongqi led everyone in discussing how to increase production. Li Xing from Sancangou said, "More weeding and topdressing will lead to more grain," Li Butang said, "I have experience. Weeding more often will make the millet grains round. Weeding less often will make the millet grains not round, at least half a dou per mu." After the discussion, each team formulated a production increase plan, and based on the discussions of each team, a village-wide plan was formulated: (1) Plow the late corn once, hoe the early corn three times, and hoe the late corn twice. (2) Hoe the millet twice and the cotton five times. Some millet should be hoed three times, and the cotton should be hoed seven times and pruned well. (3) Sow more vegetables and buckwheat. (4) Make time for sideline occupations. (5) Organize spinning well and continue to save. The whole village has a total of 853.7 mu of millet land, all of which has been hoeed once. 276 mu have been hoeed three times. 214.1 mu of cotton have all been hoeed four times, and 29.9 mu have been hoeed six times. 331 mu have been sown with vegetables (including barren slopes), and 27 mu have been sown with buckwheat. The plan will be completely completed within half a month. Under the slogan of deep plowing, hoeing, and topdressing to increase grain production and overcome famine, the whole village has launched a vigorous weeding campaign.

　　【Report from the newspaper in Pingshun】Yang Guilai's team in Foucheng Village, 7th District, held a meeting to discuss how to increase grain, with the following thoughts: 1. The seedlings have grown up, and it is now the beginning of autumn. Topdressing three more times may not help. 2. It is difficult to get into the deep seedlings, and we are afraid of damaging and breaking the adzuki bean seedlings. Topdressing all of them would also lead to a lack of fertilizer. Yang Guilai said: The more you hoe the crops, the more drought-resistant they become. Hoeing millet three times will yield seven sheng of milled rice. Topdressing corn and hoeing it three times will result in larger ears with full grains and thinner skins without weeds. The more the adzuki bean vines are touched, the more branches they will have, and the more they will grow. After this debate, everyone realized that topdressing and hoeing three times can increase production, and a fertilizer increase method was discussed: emptying latrines, scraping walls, beating kang soil, and sweeping street fertilizer to overcome the fertilizer shortage. All the men and women in the team were appropriately assigned scores (according to labor strength) to adjust the plan, and within nine days, all the millet and corn were hoeed three times, the corn was all topdressed, and the miscellaneous grains were hoeed twice.

　　【Report from the newspaper】In Lihu Village, 7th District, Pingshun, the whole village planted a total of 911 mu of corn, 814 mu of millet, and 454 mu of miscellaneous grains, and set a plan to hoe the seedlings three times in thirteen days. The slogan put forward in the plan was "If you want to produce more grain, hoe three times in a row," "The more you hoe and topdress, the more energy you have." As a result, the masses rushed to hoe three times and topdress. Under the influence of Jiao Tingqun's group carrying fertilizer to the fields, all groups in the village started carrying fertilizer to the fields, so that sowing, planting vegetables, and carrying fertilizer were not delayed. The initial summary shows that 423 mu of corn land and 53 mu of millet land have been topdressed, and more than 60 mu have been planted with radishes and vegetables. Ma Tingxiang and other four groups completed the plan ahead of schedule and organized themselves into a shock team to attack the backward groups. In the attack, Song Silou's group used a contracting method, paying two work points per mu for hoeing, with a wage of two sheng of rice per work point, regardless of meals, and ensuring that the hoeing was done well. Each group had a technician to hoe a standard area, and members who did not meet the standard had their points deducted. In this way, the technology was improved, and the enthusiasm of the masses was great. (Production Inspection Report)

　　西柏峪细作增产
  　讲究锄苗技术
  　小组天天检查
    【本报黎城讯】西柏峪英雄刘恩堂亲自领导全村各组队的技术员六十四人，于本月四号研究锄苗、上追肥、撒菜与修理花的技术。李从喜说：“总得分开好坏把式，实行奖励技术才能提高技术。现棉花枝长的很长，一不小心就要打下果枝，锄时不能照以前拉长锄，还得弯下腰捉锄把。”李劳虎说：“现在玉茭要想长的快，必须再上一次追肥，上的时候，要在玉茭两边的叶子下刨两个圪道儿，两边灌圊，不浪费了肥力，都上在玉茭穗上了。”刘恩堂说：“刚下了透雨，棉花的油条杈儿猫儿头正是发展时候，不用几天就荒了，各组必须有专人领导妇女去详细修理，技术要想提高，总得经常在地检查。”大家一致提出：各组在地休息就检查，决定十天全村总检查，小组天天检查。经过这样研究，大家认识到技术是增产的主要条件。各组现在到地休息下就研究技术，全村农业技术有很大改进。（德明、崇歧、新文、建文）
    【本报黎城讯】秋树垣支书李崇奇领导大家讨论如何增产。三苍沟李星说：“多锄上追肥才能多打粮，”李布堂说：“我有经验，多锄一次，谷籽能长成圆的，少锄一次，谷籽长不圆，一亩至少隔五大升”。讨论过去，各组都纷纷订出增产计划，根据各组讨论订出全村计划：（一）直晚玉茭普拦一次，直玉茭锄三次，晚玉茭锄二次。（二）谷锄二次花五次，有部分谷锄三次，花锄七次修理好。（三）多撒菜种荞麦。（四）抽空儿搞副业。（五）组织好纺纱，继续节约。全村共有谷地八百五十三亩七分，全部完成一锄，二百七十六亩锄过三次，棉花二百一十四亩一分，全部完成四锄，上六锄的有二十九亩九分，撒菜三百三十一亩（包括荒坡地），撒荞麦二十七亩，半月内彻底完成计划。全村在深耕锄刨上追肥，增产粮食渡灾荒的口号下，开展了轰轰烈烈的锄苗运动。（秋树垣通讯组）
    【本报平顺讯】七区否城村杨贵来小组召开全组会议讨论如何增加粮食，有以下思想：一、苗子已长大了，现已立秋，再上三遍恐不顶事。二、苗深钻不进人，怕毁坏碰断红豆秧，全部上追肥又缺肥。杨贵来说：庄稼越锄多能抗旱，谷锄三遍碾米七升，玉茭上追肥锄三遍，穗大籽饱满，皮子还薄又不生草，红豆秧越碰到枝头越多长的又肥。这样争论后，认识了上追肥锄三遍能多增加产量，并讨论出增肥办法：掏茅坑、刮墙皮、打炕土、扫街肥，把缺肥困难克服啦。又将全组男女全劳力适当评出分数（按劳力强弱）死分活折，在九天内谷玉茭全部完成锄三遍，玉茭全部上追肥，杂粮完成二遍。（建杰、永祥、奂富）
    【本报讯】平顺七区里虎村，全村共种玉茭九百一十一亩，谷八百一十四亩，杂粮四百五十四亩，订出了十三天锄三遍苗的计划，在计划中提出的口号是“要想多打粮，连锄代耧接三抢”“锄苗上追肥越上越有劲”，于是群众都突击锄三遍上追肥，在焦廷群组往地里走捎肥影响下，全村各组往地走都捎起肥来，这样搂地种菜担肥三不误。初步总结玉茭地上追肥四百二十三亩，谷地上追肥五十三亩，种萝卜菜六十多亩。马廷详等四个组提前完成了计划，就组织他们为突击组，向落后小组突击，在突击中宋四楼组用包工办法，搂一亩地两个工，每一工不管饭二升米的工资，并要保证搂好。各小组有一个技术员搂出标准，组员搂的不合标准的就减分，这样就把技术提高了，群众的劲头很大。（生产检查报）
