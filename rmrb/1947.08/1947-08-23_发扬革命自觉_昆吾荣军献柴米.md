　　Developing Revolutionary Consciousness
  　Kunwu Veterans Donate Firewood and Grain
    [Our newspaper, Jilu Yu, 22nd dispatch] Kunwu honorary veterans, through setting examples and achieving merits, have launched a wave of donating rice and firewood. The county's sixty-four honorary veterans have donated a total of 16,960 catties of rice and 13,952 catties of firewood. When the county issued the veterans' supply of rice and firewood for the second half of the year, the honorary veterans stated, "I have already been allocated grain during the land reform, and my life has improved, so there is no need for the government to supply it anymore." First-class disabled soldier Shi Wanfeng proposed, "From now on, I will not smoke or drink alcohol, and I will save half a year's supply to send to the soldiers at the front." Cao County veteran Lü Jinhua said, "I shed blood for the revolution and became disabled, and my parents were also killed by the enemy. In order to fulfill my filial piety and avenge them, I will donate 600 catties of wheat." Then, the fellow honorary veterans reported one after another, and the atmosphere was extremely enthusiastic. A total of twenty-nine people donated all, thirty-five donated a part, and a total of 2,240 catties of wheat, 14,680 catties of millet, and 13,952 catties of firewood were donated. They also set merit conditions to further carry out meritorious service.
