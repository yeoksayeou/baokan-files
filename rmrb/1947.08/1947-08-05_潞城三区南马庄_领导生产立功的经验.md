Nanmazhuang, Lucheng Third District
Experiences in Leading Production and Achieving Meritorious Service

Lucheng Third District has promoted increased production and thrift through the method of evaluating merit and commending models. The experiences of Nanmazhuang in leading the effort to achieve meritorious service are introduced as follows: (1) Those who have made contributions should add to their merits, and those who have not should strive to make contributions. After the first village-wide summary and merit evaluation following the rush harvest, the masses' enthusiasm for production greatly increased. In order to promote production and prepare for famine, the slogan "Those who have made contributions should add to their merits, and those who have not should look everywhere for opportunities to make contributions" was proposed. This slogan became the guiding principle for everyone in the village. For example, Ma Jinhua, despite being pregnant, still spun four liang of thread every day. Su Gai, despite having scabies and being unable to sit, also knelt to spin thread in order to achieve meritorious service, spinning five jin and thirteen liang of thread in fifteen days. Zhao Nüze, a 59-year-old woman, although not a team leader or group leader, actively led the women of the team in spinning and weaving, winning the red flag team award. Everyone elected her as the village's first-class meritorious person. Model military family member Guo Xinhe, in order to save labor, did not want a substitute farmer, and actively helped the families of military personnel and militiamen participating in the war with farming, earning a special-class merit in the village. In this merit-making campaign, many backward elements were also drawn into the movement. (2) Set up half-month plans and conduct regular inspections and summaries. It is important for leaders to grasp the reality of the masses, to set short-term plans, and to conduct inspections, summaries, merit evaluations, and commendations. After the merit evaluation at the end of the summer harvest, the masses saw the glory of achieving meritorious service. The leadership immediately seized the opportunity to propose that everyone should strive to achieve meritorious service in the next half-month's work of weeding, replanting, and spinning and weaving to prepare for famine, even if it was just a little bit, which was in line with the tastes of the masses, especially for those who thought "I can't do anything anyway," pointing out a way out. (3) The role of the broadcasting station in boosting morale. The village broadcasting station broadcast the daily achievements of each male and female team every evening, but without judging good or bad, allowing the masses to compare themselves after listening. This was actually praising the good and criticizing the bad, which was more effective than the leaders' evaluation of good or bad. (4) The masses evaluate merit and commend models. After each stage of work, each group and team carries out evaluation of merits and comparison of achievements to conduct summaries and evaluations. Finally, they gather together to elect village-wide models. If the group's evaluation is unfair, it will be evaluated at the brigade and village level. This does not erase anyone's slightest achievement. The Merit Evaluation Committee only has the right to propose, not the right to decide. The size of anyone's contribution is decided by the masses. (5) Merit-recording method: Merit is calculated in points. First, a standard score is determined. The highest score is 50 points, and the lowest score is 3 points. Those who are elected as special-class meritorious persons receive an additional 20 points and are listed on the list for commendation in turn. After the second inspection and the final overall evaluation, there were 69 meritorious persons, accounting for one-third of the village's semi-labor force. Although this seems like a large merit-making area and somewhat ordinary, they do not record merit by grade, but evaluate merit by score. In this way, it can promote a specialty and play a role in promoting rural production and thrift. (Shi Tuzhang, Liu Shude, Guo Xicang, Yang Junsheng)

    潞城三区南马庄
    领导生产立功的经验
    潞城三区用评功表模的方法，推动了增产节约，现将南马庄领导立功经验介绍如下：（一）有功者功上加功，没功者争取立功。南马庄突击夏收后，经过全村第一次总结，评功表模，群众的生产积极性大大提高，为推动生产备荒，即提出“有功者功上加功，没功者到处找功”的口号，这一口号成为该村每个人的行动指针。如马金花，怀着胎还每天纺四两线，苏改先生疥不能坐，为了立功也每天跪着纺花，十五天纺线五斤十三两，五十九岁的赵女则老太太，自己虽不是队长组长，便积极带领全队妇女纺织，争了红旗队，大家评选他是全村第一等功臣。模范军属老汉郭新和，为节省劳力，不要代耕，而且积极给军属参战民兵家代耕，立了全村特等功。在此次立功运动中，有很多落后分子也都卷到运动中来。（二）订出半月计划，定期检查总结。群众的现实性被领导上掌握了，定短期计划和检查总结评功表模，是很重要的。夏收结束评功表模后，群众见到立功光荣，领导上当即趁热打铁，提出下半个月锄苗、补种、纺织备荒等工作中，人人要争取立功，有一点算一点，合乎群众口味，特别对认为“咱怎也不行人的”，指明出路。（三）广播台的鼓动工作。村广播台每日晚上广播男女各组队的一天成绩，但不评判好坏，让群众听后，自己比较。这实际是对好的作了表扬，对坏的作了批判，这比领导上评定好坏，效力还大。（四）群众评功表模，每一段工作结束后，在各组队即开展表功劳比成绩，进行总结评选。最后再集中起来评选出全村模范，假若小组评不公，到大队全村评。这样不抹煞一个人一点成绩，立功委员会只有提意权，没有决定权，谁的功大小，是群众评选决定。（五）记功办法：功是以分计算，首先确定标准分，最高者是五十分，最底者还有记三分的，评选为特等功臣者，外加二十分，并依次登榜表扬，经第二次检查，总评选后，立功者有六十九人，占全村全半劳力三分之一，这样看来虽立功面大，有些平淡，但他们不是以等级记功，而是以分数评功，这样能发扬一技之长，推动农村生产节约很起作用。（史土长、刘树德、郭喜仓、杨俊胜）
