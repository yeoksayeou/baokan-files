The Problem of Integrating Industry, Agriculture, and Agricultural By-products in Changzhi
    Ren Yinglun

After settling the large-scale labor exchange accounts during the spring plowing and sowing, and after carrying out the seedling movement, the entire county organized the integration of industry, agriculture, and agricultural by-products, revealing many new problems and also some good methods created by the masses. Based on the experiences of several villages, the following issues are presented for study:

　　I. Misconceptions and Reactions to the Policy of Organized Production and Mutual Aid.

On the basis of land reform, we proposed organizing large-scale production. The masses' slogan was "If you want to thoroughly turn yourself over, you must also establish a solid foundation for prosperity through production." Generally, the emancipated masses responded to the call, participating in mutual aid teams immediately and mostly voluntarily. Judging from the results of this year's spring plowing, sowing, and weeding campaign, the masses unanimously felt that organized effort was powerful. This was because, despite the late start of spring plowing and the interruption of 280,000 workdays due to participation in the war effort, agricultural production was not affected. At the same time, more than half of the areas implemented a simple policy of equivalent exchange (such as exchanging labor for labor), and a small number of areas implemented a detailed three-way combination of equivalent exchange. This was progress since the spring plowing and large-scale production.

However, in some areas, some village cadres and activists had misconceptions about the mutual aid policy. Coupled with the failure to settle mutual aid wages from last year, some abnormal phenomena emerged. The masses were afraid of being taken advantage of, and some had indeed been taken advantage of during mutual aid last year. When mutual aid was proposed this year, some people believed that mutual aid teams were for those with labor power to help those without. Since everyone was working and living together, why talk about who was more or less capable? Anyone who brought up the issue of wage rates or skill levels was considered selfish. This led to two kinds of reactions:

    (1) The workers suffered losses due to the unequal exchange method. In the Beipo team of Jia Tianshui in the Fifth District, the emphasis was on not leaving a single mu of land uncultivated. Tian Baode complained about not receiving wages. Carpenter workers, more than ten people, each received a daily wage of five jin and nine liang of rice at the factory (mutual aid wages were five jin with meals and eight jin without meals). Workers lost more than two jin of rice per day on meals. Similarly, Chun Sheng and others earned five dou of rice after grinding flour for three months (sporadic work), half the amount of mutual aid wages.

    (2) In Hukou Town, there were nine teams with a rigid combination of agriculture and sideline occupations. People who drove carts for outside transportation kept the money they earned to themselves, unrelated to the mutual aid team. The mutual aid team cultivated their land and provided rice according to mutual aid wages. Even when they were away for transportation, the team had to sow their land early and well. In order to combine agriculture and sideline occupations, the mutual aid team suffered losses, while the transporters benefited. Some, in addition to clearing mutual aid wages, distributed profits at two for labor and eight for dividends within the team, making the team's benefits inappropriate.

　　II. New Problems and New Directions in the Integration of Industry, Agriculture, and Agricultural By-products

The Beipo incident provided us with a great lesson. The organizational form of the integration of agriculture and sideline occupations (including the integration of industry and agriculture) and the necessary appropriate resolution of equivalent exchange are essential, otherwise it will cause dissatisfaction among the masses and give special agents opportunities to exploit. From the perspective of the masses' thinking, it is an issue of education on mutual aid policies.

On May 20th, the Beipo Village in the Fifth District experienced the incident where a special agent organization used backward elements to beat to death the emancipated hero Lu Heiha. The essence of the incident was the landlord class's counterattack against the peasants. One of the reasons for the occurrence of the problem was the unequal exchange in the integration of industry and agriculture in the village, where the workers suffered losses, and the annexation policy of large-scale cooperation swallowing up small-scale cooperation in the direction of integrating agriculture and sideline occupations, which limited the active role of small-scale cooperators in making the best use of their talents. After summarizing the experience of mutual aid and cooperation in Beipo, we were given a profound lesson in the integration of agriculture, sideline occupations, industry, and agriculture. Moreover, after resolving the problems of coal and iron industry cooperation in Shanhou, Fourth District, we paid more attention to this issue and gradually found some solutions.

In Jinliangsi Village, First District, the mutual aid between industry and agriculture was unequal, and carpenters suffered losses. The carpenters were unenthusiastic about their work and raised objections. The village cadres did not solve the problem for them and even criticized them, saying, "Our village cadres can serve the masses, why can't you serve?" The carpenter's reply was correct: "You village cadres can be transferred, but are you asking us to serve for a lifetime?" After the leadership's inspection, a meeting was held to review that this kind of statement was incorrect and could not solve the problem. Finally, it was stipulated that the carpenter's daily wage was six jin of rice with meals, two jin higher than the mutual aid wage. The Luojizhuang Wood Factory adopted a system of dividing profits at six for labor and four for capital, where capital referred to the village's share capital. Carpenters and villagers exchanged labor, settling accounts according to large-scale labor exchange. Carpenters in Guan Village implemented contracting. The mutual aid wage was four sheng of rice per meal, and the worker's wage was five sheng of rice per meal. Making a weaving machine was counted as fifteen workdays, and if more were made, it was counted as thirteen workdays. The materials were from the village cooperative. After the sales money was deducted for wages, the remainder belonged to the cooperative. The carpenter's land was cultivated by mutual aid teams, ensuring good cultivation, and accounts were settled according to mutual aid wages. In Zifang Village, eleven carpenter workers received over ten thousand shares of capital from the villagers. Every day, in addition to eating five sheng of rice, they earned dividends and divided profits at six for labor and four for capital. The workers did not have to contribute to public tasks and were responsible for making hand grenade handles for the village (the whole village bore this considerable burden) without paying money.

Based on the above situation and the worker issues in the coal and iron industry in Yincheng, Fourth District, the following experiences regarding the integration of industry, agriculture, and agricultural by-products are worth continuing to implement in practical work.

    (1) The ideological education on organized mutual aid and mutual benefit. With nearly two years of work foundation since liberation in Changzhi, the masses are not yet accustomed to organized production and have not yet realized the benefits of organized production. Therefore, ideological education on getting rich through organized effort and organizational education on mutual aid and mutual benefit have become urgent and widespread tasks. Concrete accounting methods should be used to illustrate which is more beneficial to oneself and to getting rich: individual labor or collective labor. The Tianhe Caolinshui team in the Second District used this method to open up the masses' minds. Cao Linshui first set a plan to get rich and led everyone to organize production. His mutual aid team developed very normally and was very solid, expanding from the original sixteen households to twenty-four households.

    Through the masses' thinking of "fear of being taken advantage of," first affirm that "fear of being taken advantage of" is correct, and being taken advantage of is wrong. Clarify what is meant by "serving the masses," what is meant by "all farmers in the world are one family," and what is meant by "selfishness." The emancipated masses should not be taken advantage of or take advantage of others when they organize mutual aid and mutual benefit. Only in this way are they one family. Taking advantage is exploitation, which is a shame for the emancipated peasants.

    (2) Mutual Benefit and Respect for Technology. Although the specific conditions in each village are different, there should not be a rigid and uniform regulation. However, a principle should be clarified from top to bottom and from bottom to top, that is, under the same labor force, the wages of workers should definitely be higher than the wages of mutual aid. Only by respecting technology and giving preferential treatment to technology can the true equivalence of industry and agriculture be achieved. For example, after re-discussion by the masses in Beipo Village, it was uniformly stipulated that wages were seven jin of rice, converted into work points. Carpenters received thirteen work points per day. Of the money earned from making weaving machines, 20% was first drawn to reward the carpenter workers, and then profits were divided according to labor and capital. The methods of Jinliangsi, Guan Village, and Zifang Village are all based on the principle of mutual aid, mutual benefit, and increasing technical wages, gradually seeking genuine equivalence.

    (3) The Specific Problems of Integrating Industry, Agriculture, and Agricultural By-products. In practice, agriculture must first be the main focus, and equivalent exchange in agricultural mutual aid must be achieved. From their own life experiences, the masses realize that only by implementing a policy of recording work points by activity, calculating accounts at the field level, and using work tickets, as well as diligently settling accounts and clearing wages in rice, can we further talk about the equivalence of industry and agriculture. The calculation of industrial and agricultural equivalence is based on agricultural mutual aid as the standard. According to the experience of this period, there are several types of integration:

    I. Based on agricultural mutual aid teams, spare time is used for sideline occupations. For example, in Taocun, First District, there is a mutual aid team of eleven households, all of whom can weave baskets and hampers. During the busy farming season, they organize land production, and in the slack season, they weave together. There is not much contradiction in the middle. It is enough to settle accounts based on agricultural mutual aid wages on the amount of land and the weakness of the labor force. The money earned belongs to the original owners, so there is no so-called profit sharing problem.

    II. Labor and draft animals are squeezed out to specialize in sideline production, and the profits are distributed to the whole team. For example, in the Tianhe Caolinshui team in the Second District, people and livestock participating in transportation are all accounted for according to mutual aid wages. People earn six jin and four liang of rice per workday, and livestock earn the equivalent of two workdays. After deducting expenses, profits are divided into 70% for the team and 30% for labor. In the 30% for labor, people and livestock are divided equally, because transportation relies entirely on the hard work of the people.

    III. Industrial and agricultural integration. In the Fourth District and parts of the Fifth District, where the coal and iron industry is concentrated, it is very important to solve the equivalent exchange of industrial and agricultural integration. According to the conditions in each village, the current better integration methods are as follows:

    (1) The comprehensive integration and comprehensive profit sharing in Huocun. Ironworkers receive fourteen points for one workday. Two people share one furnace, and making 1,600 lotus nails counts as two workdays. Working in the coal mine receives twenty points for one workday, and fifty baskets of coal is one workday. Stirring the paddle receives ten points for one workday, and two hundred baskets are counted as one workday. Spinning half a jin of thread receives ten points, weaving two zhang of cloth receives ten points, sizing six jin of thread receives ten points, winding eight jin of thread receives ten points, warping and hooking six jin of thread receives ten points, mounting one machine receives five points, and supporting errands for sixty li with sixty jin receives ten points, and two jin of rice and three hundred yuan in travel expenses are issued. Participating in the war does not issue rice, and one day receives ten points. The money earned by the remaining labor force is divided at eight for labor and two for capital.

    (2) In villages with a concentration of workers, such as the Wang Huaishuang team of Shuanggang Village, there are twelve households, ten full laborers, two half laborers, four children, and three women. There are one hundred and twenty-six mu of land. The whole team is made up of both workers and peasants. Making twelve wooden ladles is one workday, making three hoes is one workday, and weeding eight fen of millet or one mu and three fen of corn are all counted as one workday. Overfulfilling the standard earns extra points. Both industrial and agricultural wages are ten jin of rice per day. The money earned from ironwork is divided at seven for labor and three for agriculture.

    In addition, workers buy livestock to help farmers, and farmers cultivate land for workers and provide rice according to mutual aid wages. Sometimes, livestock plow the land for workers without calculating wages, and the money earned from livestock transportation all belongs to the farmers. Generally, the method of the Zhanglou team in Huanghe is still adopted, and no new problems have yet emerged.

　　长治工农农副结合问题
    任映仑
    经过清算春耕下种时的大变工帐，经过苗运动的开展，全县组织起来工农农副结合，发有许多新问题，也有一些好办法从群众中创造出来，根据几个村的经验，有以下几个问题提出研究：
　　一、对组织起来生产互助政策的错觉与反映。
    我们在土地改革的基础上，提出组织起来大生产；群众的口号是“要想彻底翻透身，还得生产安富根”。一般翻身群众都能响应号召，即时的而且大部是自愿的参加了互助组。从今年的春耕下种到锄苗运动的结果上看，群众一致感到组织起来力量大，因为今年春耕时动迟，中间参战运误工二十八万，农业生产并未受到影响；同时有一半以上地区实行了简单的等价交换政策（如工拨工等），有一小部地区实行了细致的三结合的等价交换，这是春耕大生产以来的进步。
    但是有一些地区有一部分村干部积极分子，对互助政策发生错觉，加上去年互助工资没有清理，便产生出一些不正常现象群众思想怕吃亏，而且去年互助时有的也较吃了亏。今年提出互助时，有些人，认为互助组是有劳力的帮助没劳力的，既然一块干生活，还说什么你长我短，谁要提出工资高低把式好坏，谁就是自私自利，由此引起两种反映：
    （一）工人吃亏的不等价办法，五区北坡贾天水组内强调不荒一亩地。天保得不上工资发牢骚。木匠工人十余人，每人在工厂一天工资五斤九两米（互助工资管饭五斤，不管饭八斤米）。工人做一天吃二斤多米的亏，又如春生等人磨粉三个月（零散做），赚了五斗米的工资，和互助工资相差一半。
    （二）壶口镇有九个组的农副硬结合，赶大车出外运输的人赚了钱和互助组没关系，互助组给他们种地按互助工资出米，运输走了还得给人家早种种好，为了农副结合，结果互助组吃了亏，运输的人占便宜。有的除互助工资清帐外，按组二劳八分红，互助组利也不适当。
　　二、工农农副结合的新问题和新方向
    北坡事件给我们提供了一个很大的教训，是农副结合的组织形式（包括工农结合）和等价交换的必须适当解决，否则会引起群众的不满，会给特务钻空子；从群众思想上看，是互助政策的教育问题。
    五区北坡村于五月二十号暴发了特务组织落后群众打死翻身英雄路黑孩事件，就该事件的本质看，是地主阶级向农民的反攻；就问题发生的原因之一看，是该村工农结合不等价，工人吃亏，农副结合的方向上大合作吞并小合作的吞并政策，限制了小型合作人尽其才的积极作用。我们总结了北坡互助合作的经验之后，给我们在农副工农结合上提供了深刻的教训；又经过四区山后煤铁业合作问题的解决，愈使我们注意了这个问题，而且逐渐的得到一些解决。
    一区津良寺村去工农互助不等价，木匠吃亏，木匠工作消极提意见，村干部不给人家解决问题，还指责人家说：“我们村干部能给群众服务，你们就不能服务？”木匠的答复很对；你们村干部还有个调动，难道叫我们服务一辈子不成？经过领导上检查，开会检讨了此种说法不对，不能解决问题，最后规定了木匠每天工资米六斤管吃，比互助工资高二斤。罗冀庄木工厂则按劳六资四分红，资即指村中群众的股金，木匠和村中工顶工，按大变工算帐。关村木匠实行包工，互助工资一顿饭四升米，工人工资一顿饭五升米，做织布机一架算十五工，做的多了算十三工，材料是村合作社的，卖了钱除开工资外，余下是合作社的，木匠的土地分别由互助种，保证种好，按互助工资清帐。紫坊村十一个木匠工人，村中群众入了十几万股本，每天除吃五升米赚了红利按劳六资四分红，工人不支差，管做村中手掷弹把子（全村负担此数相当繁重）不出钱。
    根据以上情况和四区荫城一带煤铁业中工人问题，关于工农农副结合有以下几个经验，值得在实际工作中继续贯彻。
    （一）组织起来互助互利的思想教育问题。长有解放将近两年的工作基础，群众对组织起来生产还没有习惯，还没有体会到组织起来生产的好处，因而组织起来发家致富的思想教育和互助互利的组织教育就成为迫切而普遍须要进行的工作了。要用具体的算帐办法说明个体劳动和集体劳动何者对自己有利，对发家致富有利。二区天河曹林水组，就是用了此种办法打通了群众思想，曹林水首先定了发家计划，并领导大家组织起来生产，他的互助组发展的很正常、很巩固，原来十六户扩大到二十四户。
    通过群众“怕吃亏”的思想，首先肯定“怕吃亏”是对的，吃亏是不对的，明确甚叫“为群众服务”甚叫“天下农民是一家”，甚叫“自私自利”，翻身群众组织起来互助互利谁也不应当吃亏，谁也不应该占别人的便宜，这样才是一家人，占便宜就是剥削，那是翻身农民的耻辱。
    （二）互助互利尊重技术，这个问题虽然各村具体情况有不同，不应来一个死板的一致的规定，但是由上而下由下而上明确了一条原则，那就是在同等劳力的情况下，工人工资肯定的应高于互助工资，只有尊重技术优待技术，才能达到工农的真正等价。如北坡村经群众重新讨论后，统一规定工资是七斤米折工计工，木匠每天十三分工，打织布机赚了钱先抽百分之二十奖励木匠工人，然后按工与资金分红。津良寺、关村、紫坊村的办法，同样是互助互利，提高技术工资，逐渐求得确实等价为原则。
    （三）工农农副结合的具体问题，做法上必须首先以农业为主，取得农业互助的等价交换，群众从自己生活体验中，认识到只有农业上实行了按活记分地头算帐使用工票，勤结帐清理工资米的等价政策，才能进一步谈到工农结合的等价，工农等价的计算都是以农业互助为标准的，根据这一时期的经验，结合形式有以下几个类型：
    一、以农业互助组为基础，抽空大家副业。如一区桃村有一个互助组十一户都会编织箩头筐子，农忙时有组织的土地生产，农闲时一起编织，中间没啥大矛盾，只在土地多少劳力弱上按农业互助工资清算就够了，赚下钱各归原主，无所谓分红问题。
    二、挤出劳力畜力专门进行副业生产，所得利益全组分红。如二区天河曹林水组参加运输的人牲口，都按互助工资算帐，人一工六斤四两米，牲口顶两工，除开支三七分红，组七劳三。劳三中人和牲口对半分，因为运输全靠人的辛苦打算。
    三、工农结合，在煤铁业集中的四区和五区的一部分地区，解决工农结合的等价交换是很重要的，根据各村情况目前比较好的结合办法有以下几种：
    （１）霍村的全面结合全面分红，打铁工人四人，一工顶十四分，两人一个火炉，做荷花钉一千六百算两工。下煤窑一工顶二十分，五十篓煤为一工。搅把的一工顶十分，二百篓记一工，纺织半斤顶十分，织布两丈顶十分，浆线六斤顶十分、络八斤顶十分，经和勾六斤顶十分，上机一机顶五分，支差六十里六十斤顶十分，发二斤米三百元盘费，参战不发米，一天顶十分，剩余劳力赚的钱，劳八资二分红。
    （２）工人较集中的如双岗村王槐双组十二户，十个全劳力，两个半劳力，儿童四、妇女三，一百二十六亩地，全组都是工人，又都是农民，打马杓十二把为一工，打锄头三为一工，锄谷八分锄玉茭一亩三分都算一工，超过标准多评分，工农工资都是一天十斤米，打铁赚下钱按工七农三分红。
    此外工人买牲口帮助农民，农民给工人种地按互助工资出米，有的牲口给工人犁地不算工资，牲口运输赚了钱全归农民。一般还是采用潢河张楼组的办法，在还没有出新的问题。
