　　＠Locusts Discovered in Shahe, Jize - Vigorous Extermination Being Organized

[Report from our reporter team on the 26th] A large number of ＠locusts were discovered in Jize County on the 16th of this month. They are shaped like silkworms, about an inch long, and specialize in eating grain leaves, multiplying extremely quickly. In the Yaozhuang area of the Second District, the number of ＠locusts tripled overnight. In some areas where the discovery was made later, the grain leaves have already been eaten bare. The situation is especially serious around the city. The County Committee of Jize County has issued an emergency directive: "We must not let the ＠locusts take away the rice bowl that is already at our mouths!" The masses in the entire county immediately took action, using a fighting spirit to go all out to fight the locusts and protect the seedlings. All county government agencies, organizations, public stores, schools, etc., have suspended work and formed locust-fighting teams to protect the seedlings together with the masses. County Head Han and Deputy County Head Yang both personally went to the locust-affected areas to capture and beat the locusts. Masses from various places have organized locust-fighting headquarters, mobilizing men, women, old, and young. Yaozhuang, a small village, mobilized more than 740 people. Villages such as Chengguan, East and West Shuangta, etc., except for the frail and elderly who cannot move, have all joined the locust-fighting teams. After four days of repeated capture and beatings, 80% of the fields in the Dongta area of the Fourth District are free of locusts. The Yaozhuang area of the Second District has also been cleared, and the urban area is also nearing eradication after repeated clearing. According to experienced farmers, ＠locusts are extremely tenacious and cannot be completely eliminated without repeated clearing several times. Many fields sprout new ones after being beaten in the front. Although most have been wiped out this time, vigilance is still needed at all times. According to a reconnaissance on the 22nd, many bean fields have also produced ladybugs. The masses in the county are continuing to engage in the fight against ladybugs with a tenacious fighting posture. (Lin Li)

[Report from our Shahe correspondent] Bugs that eat grain leaves have been discovered in twenty-one villages including Weizhuang and Xinzhuang in the Second District. The masses are doing their best to eliminate them. The western part of the Second District had earlier rainfall in the spring, and the crops are growing well. However, due to several consecutive rains recently, insect pests have been commonly found in the grain fields. The large ones are an inch long, and the small ones are the size of wheat grains or ants. The colors are yellow, black, and green, and they are all red-headed bugs. The five or six *qing* of land in Weizhuang are the most severely affected. One can knock down forty or fifty bugs by hitting a patch of land. At first, the masses were afraid of stepping on the ground and damaging the crops, but the situation became more serious day by day, and many people felt panicked. The leadership quickly convened everyone to discuss solutions. According to past experience in fighting locusts, mutual assistance is more powerful. The organizational method is that the entire village is divided into five teams, and each team is divided into three groups. Everyone takes a dustpan to the field to beat the bugs. At the same time, the leaders of the Second District mobilized neighboring villages to support the bug-infested areas in capturing and beating. Section Chief Wang of the County Government went to the First District to organize the masses to provide support. The leaders put forward slogans, calling on everyone to perform meritorious service for the people in the fight against bugs. The morale of the masses is even higher. Some people do not rest at noon, and some even fight under the moonlight. The masses in various villages have launched a bug-killing campaign. Insect pests have also begun to be discovered in villages such as Chennao, Pengnao, and Jiangjunmu in the First District. District Head Shi personally went to the Pengnao area to inspect and organized the masses to quickly eliminate them. He also informed all villages to conduct close reconnaissance and pay close attention to the development of insect pests, so as to eliminate them as soon as they are discovered. (Kui Lin)

　　鸡泽沙河发现＠蝗　现正组织大力围剿
    【本报记者团二十六日电】鸡泽县境于本月十六日发现大批＠蝗，形状似蚕，长约寸许，专蚀谷叶，繁殖极快。二区要庄一带＠蝗一夜即增多三倍，某些发觉较晚区谷叶已被吃光，城周尤为严重。该县县委会已发出紧急指示：“已到嘴边的饭碗，决不能让＠蝗夺去。”全县群众立刻行动起来，以战斗的精神全力打蝗保苗。县府各机关团体、公营商店、学校等一律停止工作，组成打蝗队，和群众一起保苗。韩县长、杨副县长均亲临蝗区捕打。各地群众纷纷组织打蝗指挥部，男女老少一齐动员。要庄一小村即出动了七百四十余人，城关、东西双塔等村除不能走动的老弱外，皆参加到打蝗队里。经四天反复捕打，四区东塔一带百分之八十的地里已无蝗踪。二区要庄一带亦已肃清，城区经再三清剿，也将近消灭。据有经验的农民谈：＠蝗极为顽强，不经三番五次的反复清剿，绝不能彻底消灭，许多地里前面打过后又生出来。此次虽大部被歼，但还要时时警惕。又据二十二日侦察，许多豆地又多生瓢虫，该县群众又以顽强的战斗姿态，继续投入打瓢虫斗争。（林里）
    【本报沙河讯】二区魏庄、新庄等二十一个村庄发现了吃谷叶的虫子，群众正以全力扑灭中。二区的西半部春天落雨较早，庄稼长的不错；但因最近连着下了几场雨，谷地里普遍的发现了虫灾，大的有一寸长，小的象麦粒或蚂蚁大小，颜色有黄、黑、青都是红头虫子。魏庄有五、六顷地最为严重，两手够着打的一片打一下就能落下四、五十条。群众开始思想上害怕踏地和毁坏庄稼，但是情况一天比一天严重，不少的人感到心慌了。领导上迅速召集大家讨论办法，根据过去打蝗经验，还是互助起来力量大。组织办法是全村分了五个队，每队又分三个小组，每人拿一个簸箕下地去打。同时二区领导上又发动了邻村支援虫灾区捕打，县府王科长又到一区组织群众支援。领导上提出口号，号召大家在打虫中为民立功。群众情绪更为高涨了，有的上午不歇晌，有的在月光底下也要打，各村群众已掀起了扑虫运动。一区陈垴、彭垴、将军墓等村也开始发现虫灾，石区长亲到彭垴一带检查，并组织群众迅速扑灭，并通知各村严密侦察，时刻注意虫灾的发展情况，要作到一发现即消灭。（奎林）
