Most of the corn received fertilizer application. Secondly, they summarized the transportation efforts during the month of hoeing seedlings and summer harvest, effectively earning 10,500 jin of millet. Following this, they summarized household savings. The total savings for the month was 56 shi of coarse grains. Women’s textile production earned 12 shi of fine grains. Among them, Wang Gexin, a military dependent, earned wheat worth 1 shi and 5 dou, enough to feed himself for ten months. Yang Xueqin earned wheat worth 1 shi and 3 dou. Both are models for grain exchange in the entire village. The above totals 68 shi of fine grains and 56 shi of coarse grains saved and earned in one month. After the summary, the men selected Wang Laiqun's group as a model for (agriculture and sideline occupations), and Yue Ernv's group as a model group for textile production and famine preparedness. They also formulated the next phase of drought prevention and famine preparedness plan: Guaranteeing seedling hoeing three times, cotton seedling hoeing six times, and mutual aid in sideline occupations. Currently, the village has selected 34 laborers to work short-term jobs in the Lucheng area to earn millet, and 15 people have been selected to drive livestock for outside transportation. They departed around the 21st. The masses confidently say: "Earning more millet to overcome famine is as important as eliminating Chiang Kai-shek." Everyone is determined to use practical actions to do a good job in production and famine preparedness to welcome "August 1st" and offer gifts to the People's Liberation Army. (Zhang Hanqing)
