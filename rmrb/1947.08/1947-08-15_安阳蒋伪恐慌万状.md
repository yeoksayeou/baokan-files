Xinhua News Agency, Jinji-Luyu, 13th: According to people from Anyang city, the Jiang puppet troops trapped in Anyang are like ants on a hot pan, utterly panicked. The original six regiments of Jiang's troops stationed in the city have had three regiments successively airlifted to Kaifeng since July 15th. The Jiang-controlled refugee county governments gathered in the city number as many as seventeen. They rely on the people's grain for sustenance, and can only eat two meals of bad corn (maize) flour a day. Recently, even this has become difficult to maintain. A large number of exiled puppet county magistrates (such as those from Daming, Hua, Jun, Neihuang counties, etc.) are disguising themselves as Jiang's soldiers (because only Jiang's soldiers can fly by plane) and fleeing to Kaifeng by plane. However, before boarding the plane, they must have one or two taels of gold as "activity expenses." A certain Gao, the Jiang-controlled county magistrate of Nanle, complained bitterly, saying, "If they don't let me board, I'll hand in my seal and quit (i.e., desert)!" Mu Qingquan, the Jiang-controlled county magistrate of Daming, was too fat and heavy, and was not approved to fly by plane. The company commander of the third company of the first battalion of the 386th Regiment of the 106th Brigade of the Jiang's 40th Division, because he was a junior officer below the rank of captain and not qualified to bring his family, had to shave his wife's head, put her in a military uniform, and put his child in a mesh basket to disguise it as luggage. Who knew that as soon as they got on the plane, the child burst into tears, and they were driven off the plane. Only after kowtowing and presenting gifts were they able to squeeze onto the plane.

　　安阳蒋伪恐慌万状
    【新华社晋冀鲁豫十三日电】据安阳城内来人谈：困驻安阳蒋伪已如热锅上蚂蚁，慌乱不堪。原驻该城蒋军共六个团，自七月十五日以来，已有三个团连续空运至开封。招集该城蒋记流亡县政府，达十七个之多，他们靠人民粮维持生活，每天仅能吃到两顿坏棒子（玉茭）面，最近亦已难于为继，大批流亡伪县长（如大名、滑、浚、内黄等县），纷纷伪装蒋军士兵（因除蒋军外，不能坐飞机），坐飞机逃往开封，但在上机之前，必须有一两半黄金作活动费，蒋记南乐县长高某大发牢骚，说：“再不让坐，我就缴印不干了（即开小差）！”蒋记大名县长穆清泉，因长得太胖，体量过重，未能批准坐飞机，蒋军四十师一○六旅三八六团一营三连连长，因是尉级以下军官没资格带家眷，只好让老婆剃成光头，穿上军衣，孩子放在网篮里伪装行李，谁知刚一上机，孩子哇的哭起来，当被驱逐下机，经叩头送礼，才挤上飞机。
