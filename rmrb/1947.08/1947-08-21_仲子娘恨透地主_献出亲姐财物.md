　　Zhong Ziniang Hates Landlords
　　献出亲姐财物
　　[Report from our newspaper in Jinnan, 19th] Zhong Ziniang offered up the hidden possessions of her own sister. Zhong Ziniang, from Xiqiji Village, Yongnian Third District, during the famine of 1943, her whole family was so hungry they were dizzy. On the verge of death, she went to her elder sister's house (Shengziniang), who was married to a landlord in the same village, to borrow rice, but she returned with an empty bowl. As she walked out the door, her sister's grandson carried a sack of corn home, passing her without daring to say a word. Now her sister's family has been struggled against, and they hid packages, wheat, and other items in Zhong Ziniang's house. She thought, "In the famine years, you wouldn't even lend a bowl of rice. Now that she's afraid of being struggled against, she's putting things in my house." So she handed over all the items to the Farmers' Association and recounted her elder sister's crimes at the struggle meeting. As a result, the whole village also began to recount their grievances, all saying, "The landlords are ruthless, they don't recognize relatives, not even sisters."

　　仲子娘恨透地主
  　献出亲姐财物
    【本报冀南十九日电】仲子娘献出亲姐隐藏财物。永年三区西七集村仲子娘，三十二年灾荒时，全家饿的头昏眼花，在将要死的关头，向嫁在本村地主的亲姐姐家（升子娘）去借米，结果揣着空碗回来。当她走出门的时候，她姐姐的孙子扛着一口袋玉米回家来，连气也不敢吭的过去了。现在她姐家被斗了，将包袱、麦子等物都运藏在仲子娘家。她想：“灾荒年连一碗米就不借给，这会她怕斗争，又在我家放东西。”于是她把全部东西交给农会，并在斗争会上陈诉亲姐的罪恶，于是全村也都诉起苦来，都说：“地主心狠，不认亲人，姊妹也不行。”
