Xinhua News Agency, Central China, 18th: In the battle to recapture Yeting (Yancheng) county seat by the Central China People's Liberation Army on the 12th, the entire remaining force of the Kuomintang-puppet army Hao Pengju's 42nd Army, the 1st Division (its 2nd Regiment had already been annihilated in the battle to capture Wu Hu on the 7th), one company of the KMT army's 49th Division, and the KMT's Yancheng County Security Team, "Homecoming Corps," and others, totaling more than 5,600 men, were wiped out. Preliminary investigations of the battle results include the capture of the KMT-puppet 42nd Army 1st Division Major General Commander Li Tiemin, the army headquarters Major General Chief of Staff Han Ming, the KMT Ministry of National Defense News Department Major General Cultural Commissioner Yang Nianxi, the 42nd Army Lieutenant Colonel Councilor Zhang Xiaoping, the 1st Regiment Colonel Commander Li Huaide, Lieutenant Colonel Deputy Commander Ma Yanming, the 3rd Regiment Colonel Commander Zheng Shude, Lieutenant Colonel Deputy Commanders Bao Qishan and Zhao Shanzhang, and other officers, as well as the KMT Yancheng County Magistrate Liu Xianpei, and more than 5,000 officers and soldiers, killing and wounding more than 600 men. The spoils of war included more than 60 artillery pieces of various sizes, 18 heavy machine guns, more than 100 light machine guns, 24 automobiles, 4 steamships, more than 20,000 artillery shells of various types, nearly 300,000 rounds of ammunition, and other military supplies and materials. After Hao Pengju surrendered to the KMT, his 2nd and 4th Divisions were annihilated in the area of Baitabu on the eastern section of the Longhai Railway this spring, and Hao himself was captured in that battle. This time, his 1st Division was also completely wiped out. Now, only the remnant of Wang Shuwen (Wang was appointed Deputy Commander of the 42nd Army after surrendering to the KMT, and renamed himself Acting Commander after Hao was captured) leads the 3rd Division, trapped south of Yeting in the line from Liuzhuang to Dongtai.

Xinhua News Agency, Central China, 18th: During the Yeting City (Yancheng) campaign, more than 50,000 militia and masses from six counties, including Dongtai, Taipei, Yeting, and Jianyang, enthusiastically participated in the war. Before and after the battle, more than 30,000 civilians transported military supplies, transferring tens of thousands of catties of grain. More than 2,000 stretchers rushed to the front lines; Yeting County alone dispatched more than 700 stretchers, and the Jianyang stretcher team came from as far as 160 li away, but most of the stretchers carried spoils of victory instead of wounded soldiers. As soon as the battle ended, the participating masses automatically cleaned up the battlefield, leveled all the bunkers and fortifications inside and outside the city. The militia and local armed forces who went to the front lines to assist in the battle captured more than 1,000 KMT-puppet soldiers and local bandits. The KMT Yancheng County Magistrate Liu Xianpei had only fled two li from Yancheng when he was captured alive by the militia of Yancheng East.
