    【Report from our newspaper in Shexian County】To welcome "August 1st," the entire county has launched a movement to support the army. After the county committee convened a meeting of district committee secretaries and district heads on July 11th, it organized large-scale current affairs propaganda to welcome "August 1st." First, district cadres and primary school teachers collectively studied current affairs, using various propaganda methods such as clappers, blackboards, and broadcast ballads. For example, the district cadres and primary school teachers of the Ninth District used base points for learning, and went to various villages to organize children's propaganda. The propaganda also combined education on the history of the Party and Army's twenty years of heroic struggle. During this movement, the entire county launched a movement to support the army, especially the liberated women, who carefully made various colorful comfort bags from their beloved flower cloths. The director of the Women's Rescue Association in Tumuhe, Third District, took the lead, and thirty-four women made eighty-two comfort items in one day. The entire county made a total of 1,456 comfort bags, more than 2,000 tobacco pouches and bowl covers, more than 800 eggs, more than 10,000 Jicha banknotes, and more than 100 letters of greeting.
