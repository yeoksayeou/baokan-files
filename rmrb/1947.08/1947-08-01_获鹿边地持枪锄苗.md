    [This Newspaper] Huolu First District Beizhai militia seized the gaps in their activities to actively hoe seedlings. They organized three mutual aid teams, each person hoeing 1.5 mu of seedlings per day. Within a short six days, they hoed more than 200 mu of seedling fields. The militiamen happily said, "This is a good method. One hand dragging a rifle, the other hoeing seedlings. When the enemy comes, we'll fight them!"
    [Another Dispatch] Under the slogan of "emancipation and production without delay," Nanliang Village in the First District, everyone organized mutual aid teams, hoeing seedlings on one hand and discussing emancipation on the other. The women also organized themselves, combining three mutual aid teams. From the afternoon of the 9th to the 11th, Hu Zhumei's team cooperated with a man to hoe seven mu of land, which was highly praised by the masses. (Jixi Minbao [Jixi People's Daily])
