　　Our Army, Capitalizing on Victory, Goes Straight to the Longhai Railway
  　Capturing Three Cities and Three Thousand Enemies
    Controlling Over 100 Li of Railway, with Shangqiu Under Our Encirclement
    [Xinhua News Agency, Frontline, Ji-Lu-Yu, 14th] After the Liu-Deng Army annihilated nine and a half brigades of the enemy in southwestern Shandong, they used a portion of their forces to launch an attack along the Longhai Railway. On the 11th, they recovered Shan County and Ningling, south of the Longhai Railway. On the 12th, they continued to capture Sui County, as well as the stations of Mamuyi, Zhangge, Liuhe, and Xiaoba, controlling over 120 li of the railway east and west of Shangqiu. The Gui-系(faction) Jiang Army's 7th Division and 48th Division, while returning from Dingtao to reinforce on the 11th, were defeated south of Cao County and fled back to the vicinity of Cao County. Our army then capitalized on the victory and went straight to the Longhai Railway. In the past three days, a battalion of the 21st Brigade of the Jiang Army's 88th Division, and all the security regiments of Sui County, Ningling, and Luyi County have been annihilated, capturing over 3,000 people including regimental and battalion commanders, and seizing a large amount of supplies. Currently, Shangqiu is under our encirclement. (Attached picture)
