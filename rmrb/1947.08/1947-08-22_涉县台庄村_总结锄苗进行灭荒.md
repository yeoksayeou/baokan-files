　　Shexian Taizhuang Village
  　Summing Up Weeding and Seedling to Eliminate Wasteland
    [This newspaper, Shexian News] The Taizhuang Village Production Committee summarized weeding and seedling on August 9th. Because the mutual aid groups were reorganized, the masses' enthusiasm for production was extremely high. The nine-and-a-half-day plan was completed in eight and a half days, saving 138 workdays. Reasons for saving labor: (1) After the mutual aid was reorganized and the model was selected, an atmosphere of meritorious service and glory was created among the masses. Everyone competed to make meritorious achievements and advance, and completed the weeding and seedling pulling movement ahead of schedule. (2) Cadres directly went deep into the mutual aid groups, truly promoted democratic leadership, grasped the timely planning of life, and rationally allocated labor, overcoming the past phenomenon of grasping everything and wasting work. (3) Mastering the timely inspection movement, and mastering the timely praise broadcast during the inspection. (4) Mobilizing women to work between fields, freeing up male labor to weed and seedlings. After summarizing weeding and seedling pulling, they launched a wasteland elimination and a second weeding movement. First, they inspected the wasteland, and found 64 mu in one day. The reason was that after the masses turned over and were allocated flat land, they did not plant slope land, and the wasteland elimination movement was carried out through education. In one and a half days, 37 mu of ripe wasteland were eliminated, and more than 30 mu of raw wasteland were reclaimed, planted with buckwheat and vegetables. They are now carrying out a second round of weeding. (Chunfang, Zhidong, Yuancun)
    [This newspaper, Shexian News] Songjiazhuang, after weeding the first time, organized four labor-selling groups to sell labor in Wu'an Yangyi area, earning a total of 35,100 yuan; the 78 full laborers at home have largely completed the second round of weeding. Grasping the gap between rains, a village-wide fertilizer accumulation campaign was launched. The following two fertilizer accumulation methods were studied: Drive the sheep to the mountains, find the thickest grass to lie down for two or three nights, then scrape it down and irrigate it with water. First, dig up the sod with soil, pile it up, and irrigate it with manure water, so that it can be applied to the ground in one month to catch up with wheat planting. Because of the lack of rain in spring, the yellow grass did not grow. (Qingxiu)
    [This newspaper, Pingshun News] Cui Fubao's labor hero group in Anyang Village sent five people from the group's military family old man Liu Linian to pull grain fields, doing it according to the quality of life, and five people were enough for half a day. Comrade Fubao led five people to discuss contracting work (a total of three plots), dividing the large plot below (1.9 mu) into 16 parts, and the two small plots above into five parts, selecting standard people according to the quality of life and the level of technology. At first, no one wanted to go to the two plots of land above to weed, because the grass was thick and the land was hard and difficult to weed. Comrade Fubao went by himself and completed it before noon. Fubao completed it earlier than them. When he came back, he also weeded two fen of grain fields for his second brother on the road. Fubao weeded 7.2 fen in half a day. (Zhaoxi, Wang Yuan)

　　涉县台庄村
  　总结锄苗进行灭荒
    【本报涉县讯】台庄村生产委员会，于八月九号总结锄苗，由于互助组经过整顿，群众生产情绪极高，九天半计划在八天半就完成了，省工一三八个。省工原因：（一）整顿互助评选模范后，群众中造成了立功光荣空气。人人争着立功前进，提前完成了锄苗拔苗运动。（二）干部直接深入互助小组，真正发扬了民主领导，掌握了及时计划生活，与合理分配劳力，克服了过去一把抓的浪费工现象。（三）掌握了及时检查运动，检查中并掌握了及时表扬广播。（四）发动妇女串地，腾出男劳力锄苗。经过总结锄苗拔苗，接着又开展了灭荒及第二个锄苗运动，首先进行检查荒地，一天检查出有六十四亩。原因是群众翻身后，分到平地，对坡地不种了，经教育开展了灭荒运动。一天半消灭熟荒三十七亩，开恳生荒三十余苗，种上荞麦和菜。现正突击锄二遍苗。（春芳、之栋、元存）
    【本报涉县讯】宋家庄，在锄完头遍地以后，组织了四个卖工小组到武安阳邑一带卖工，共赚工资洋三五一○○元；家里的七十八个全劳力，把二遍地已大部锄完。抓住下雨空隙，又开展了全村性的积肥运动。并研究以下两种积肥办法：把羊赶到山上，找草最厚的地方卧个三两夜，再刮下来，用水一灌就行。先把草皮带土刨下，积成一堆，用大粪水灌上，这样一个月就能上地赶上种麦用。因春天缺雨，黄蒿没长起来。（清秀）
    【本报平顺讯】安阳村劳动英雄崔福保组，组军属老汉刘礼年拉谷地去了五个人，按生活好坏做，五人足得半天。福保同志领着五人讨论包工（地共三块），把底下的一大块（一亩九分）作了十六分，上边的两小块作了五分、按生活的好坏技术的高低选出标准人来。开始谁也不愿意去上两块地锄，因草多地硬不好锄，福保同志就自己去了，不到晌午就完成了。福保比他们还完成的早，回来时在路上还给他二哥锄了二分谷地，光福保半天时间锄了七分二厘。（招喜、王元）
