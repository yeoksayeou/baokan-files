Xinhua News Agency, Jinji-Luyu, 9th: The emergency flood prevention conference held at the end of last month by the Hebei-Shandong-Henan Administrative Office and the Yellow River Commission reached the following important resolutions: (1) Mobilize everyone to recognize Chiang Kai-shek's poisonous scheme to destroy dams and create disasters by breaching dikes, sufficiently estimate the difficulties of flood prevention work, and resolutely overcome them. (2) Flood prevention leadership must be unified and responsibilities divided. Each county should establish county, district, and village-level flood prevention headquarters, clearly delineate dangerous works and flood prevention sections, and assign responsibility for each section. (3) Villages within 14 to 15 li along the river are designated as dike protection villages, responsible for emergency repairs by the district and village headquarters. In case of danger, the entire village must go to the dike for rescue. (4) Immediately set up a sentry post every 200 meters on the dike, each post manned by two people responsible for patrolling, sending information, and repairing drainage ditches. Increase personnel when the water rises significantly. (5) Villagers going to the dike must bring shovels, baskets, cloth bags, door panels, iron hammers, sledgehammers, and other tools, and each person must bring 30 jin of sorghum leaves and other grasses for emergency repairs. (6) Establish an emergency rescue team in the village. In case of danger, quickly go to the dike. (7) Losses suffered by the masses due to flood fighting should be compensated, and the injured and deceased should be given condolences. Expenses will be reimbursed by the Yellow River Commission. (8) After the water erodes the dike root, residents near the riverbed should immediately move important belongings. Assistance should be provided to residents on the back of the river. (9) Pay attention to saving manpower and materials. Those with excellent performance will be rewarded. Currently, seven million people along the river are working day and night to implement this resolution and fight the flood.

Xinhua News Agency, Shandong, 9th: Jiang Yankun and Wang Yizhi, directors of the Shandong Provincial River Affairs Bureau, recently issued a solemn statement regarding Chiang Kai-shek's sabotage of Yellow River flood control, stating that due to the joint destruction of flood prevention and rescue projects in the Bohai Sea area by Chiang Kai-shek's planes, troops, and secret agents, millions of people along the river are facing serious floods. According to incomplete statistics for July alone (Chiang's planes have been continuously bombing until now), 97 American-made Chiang planes bombed and strafed along the river 29 times, killing and injuring 13 Yellow River management employees, killing and injuring 126 livestock seized by Chiang's secret agents, destroying 45 military trucks transporting materials, 30 boats, and burning more than 310,000 jin of straw. Since the onset of the summer floods on July 26, the river water has risen, and Chiang's planes have intensified their sabotage, carrying out night raids after days of attacks. Dikes that have been bombed have either collapsed or been damaged. Currently, the Xiao Shen Miao and 1200 (village name) areas have been breached and flooded. The Wangjiazhuang, Damazhuang, and Xiaojiezi dangerous works in Lijin are simultaneously in critical condition. Other dangerous works such as those in Putai are also in precarious situations. Although our party, government, military, and academic institutions at all levels have made every effort to coordinate with the residents along the coast to rescue, more than 3,000 people have been repairing a narrow section of more than 100 meters long at the Damazhuang dangerous works for three days and nights, using more than 2,000 cubic meters of brick and 13,000 hemp bags. However, it is impossible to prevent the bombing, which occurs as soon as the repair is completed. Now, in addition to continuing to mobilize more manpower and material resources to carry out life-risking rescue regardless of any sabotage by Chiang Kai-shek, we specially accuse Chiang Kai-shek and the UN relief's accomplices of the vicious conspiracy to flood the liberated areas to righteous people all over the country and the world. Facts have proved that if Chiang Kai-shek did not have the support of the UN relief, he could not and would not dare to block the river at Huayuankou and release the water. Without the aid of US imperialism to Chiang, there would not be so many Chiang planes bombing dikes everywhere. The UN relief, instead of stopping Chiang Kai-shek's crime of creating floods, suppressed the anti-flood materials that the liberated areas should have received and used a large amount of relief materials to aid Chiang's civil war. Therefore, Chiang Kai-shek should bear the primary responsibility for all the bad consequences caused by Chiang Kai-shek's direct sabotage of flood prevention and rescue, and the UN relief cannot escape its blame either.

　　冀鲁豫举行紧急防泛会议
  　严密防范蒋贼决定
    山东河务局长斥美助蒋制造泛滥
    【新华社晋冀鲁豫九日电】上月底举行之冀鲁豫行署及黄委会紧急防泛会议，其重要决议如下：（一）动员大家认识蒋贼破坏堤坝决口成灾毒计，足够估计防泛工作的困难并坚决克服之。（二）防泛领导必须统一分工，各县成立县、区、村各级防泛指挥部，明确划分险工与防泛段，分段负责。（三）沿河十四里至十五里为护堤村，由区村指挥部负责抢修，一旦出险，全体上堤抢救。（四）马上在堤上每距二百公尺搭一窝铺，每窝铺内由两人担任巡逻送情报，修水沟，水大即增调人。（五）上堤民夫须各带锨、筐、布袋、门板、铁锤、榔头等工具及每人带三十斤高粱叶等草类，以备抢险。（六）村中成立抢险突击队，一遇出险，迅即上堤。（七）群众因抢险所受损失要赔偿，伤亡要抚恤，开支统由黄委会报销。（八）水偎堤根后，河床居民应马上将重要财物搬走，背河群众应予援助。（九）注意节约人力物力，成绩优良者予以奖励，。现沿河七百万人民正为贯澈这一决议昼夜与洪水奋斗中。
    【新华社山东九日电】山东省河务局江衍坤、王宜之两局长顷为蒋贼破坏黄河抢险，发表严正声明，称：由于蒋机蒋军蒋特对渤海区防泛抢险工程的联合破坏，已使沿河数百万人民面临严重水灾。仅据七月份（按蒋机连续滥炸迄今未止）不完全统计，即有美制蒋机九十七架沿河轰炸扫射二十九次，死伤治黄员工十三名，毙伤及为蒋特抢去牲口一百二十六头，炸毁运料军车四十五辆，船三十只，焚毁秸料三十一万余斤。自七月二十六日伏泛到来；河水上涨，蒋机破坏益烈，日袭之不足更继之以夜袭，被炸堤坝，或陷或场。现肖神庙、一千二（村名）等地已决口被淹。利津之王家庄、大马庄、小街子险工同时告急。其他如蒲台等地险工，尤险象环生。我各地党政军学虽竭全力协同沿岸居民抢救，仅在大马庄险工百余公尺长的狭小地段内，即有三千余人抢修三昼夜，使用砖料两千余方，麻袋一万三千余条，但无奈旋修旋炸，防不胜防。现在我们除继续动员更多的人力物力，不顾蒋贼任何破坏进行冒死抢救外，特向全国全世界正义人士控诉蒋贼及联总帮凶水淹解放区的恶毒阴谋。事实证明，蒋贼若没有联总的支助，他就不能也不敢在花园口堵口放水。没有美帝国主义的援蒋，就没有这样多的蒋机到处炸堤。联总对蒋贼制造泛滥罪行，不但不加制止，旦扣压解放区应得治黄物资，却以大量救济物资援蒋内战。因此蒋贼直接破坏防泛抢险所引起之一切恶果，蒋贼应负主要责任，联总亦不能辞其咎。
