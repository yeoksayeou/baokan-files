Taiyue Special-Class Combat Hero
Li Buzhou in Hospital
    Zhi Yuan
Comrade Li Buzhou, the famous special-class combat hero under General Chen Geng, was honorably wounded in the Yuncheng battle. He went to a rear hospital for treatment. Instructor Xia there had met him at the Zongdui Meritorious Personnel Conference. Upon seeing him, she warmly greeted and comforted him. The next day, all the personnel spontaneously launched a donation drive to comfort the hero, giving him 2,500 yuan in Jicha banknotes, two sets of clothes, as well as soap, socks, towels, and other items. On the third day, an unfamiliar cadre from Wenxi brought twenty-five eggs and two packs of cigarettes to comfort him, saying, "You are a hero. I often read about your heroic deeds in the newspaper. In the battle to capture Wenxi, you led the soldiers to annihilate an enemy squad!" Comrade Li Buzhou was very moved to accept everyone's sincere love. Soon, his wound improved slightly, and he no longer needed others to take care of him. He walked around with crutches and often helped other wounded soldiers. In the hospital, he became the core of unity for all the recuperating patients and staff. No one disliked him. Everyone elected him as the recuperation platoon leader. He proposed that the recuperating patients from various brigades live together to facilitate work and launched an inter-group competition, and the recuperating patients' spirits were high and happy. During this period, another well-known hero, Comrade Jiao Wubao, was seriously wounded in the Xiangning battle and came here to recuperate. As soon as they met, the two immediately became like-minded good friends. Heroes love heroes. They often talked about their backgrounds and exchanged work experience. Later, Jiao Wubao was also elected as the recuperation platoon leader, and they two started a competition in their work. Li Buzhou originally needed to recuperate for a period of time, but seeing that the war situation was developing rapidly, he could no longer stay. He asked to return to the front. The regimental leaders, after learning about this, sent livestock to pick him up, but the recuperating patients in the entire hospital could not persuade him to stay. Jiao Wubao asked him to wait a few days so that the two could be discharged from the hospital together, but it didn't work. When he left, two of the more seriously wounded patients were so sad that they didn't even eat, and the mobile wounded soldiers scrambled to get him things to see him off. Because he was not only a model recuperating patient in the hospital, but also a model worker, the hospital gave him a major merit and awarded him a glorious certificate of merit.

    太岳特等战斗英雄
    李步周在医院
    志远
    陈赓将军部下著名的特等战斗英雄李步周同志，在运城战斗中光荣负伤，到后方医院治疗，那里的夏指导员，曾在纵队功臣大会上认识他，一见他去，即热情的招护安慰他，第二天所有的人员，自动的发起了慰问英雄募捐，送给他二千五百元冀钞，两套衣服，还有肥皂、袜子、毛巾等。第三天有一个不相识的闻喜干部，拿了廿五个鸡蛋，两包纸烟来慰问他说：“你是个英雄，我在报纸上常见到你的英雄事迹，攻克闻喜的战斗中，你带着战士们消灭了敌人一个班！”李步周同志十分感动的接受大家这种至诚的热爱。不久，他的创伤稍好一些，他便不要别人招护，拄着拐棍走动，并且时常去帮助别的伤员。他在医院里便成了全体休养员和工作者的团结核心。没有一个人不喜欢他，大家选他当了休养排长，他提议让各旅的休养员住在一块儿，便于工作，并发动了相互间的竞赛，休养员的情绪都很饱满，愉快。这期间另一个闻名的英雄焦五保同志，在乡宁战斗中负了重伤，来在这里休养了，他们一相遇，两人便立即成了情投意合的好朋友。英雄爱英雄，他们经常在一起谈自己的身世，交换工作经验。后来焦五保也被选为休养排长，他两又进行工作上的竞赛。李步周本来还需要休养一个时期，但他看到战局正在急遽发展，再也不能住下去，要求回到前方去，团里知道了，便派了牲口来接他，全院休养员挽留不住。焦五保请他等待几天两人一同出院也不行。他走的时候，有两个较重的伤员，难过的连饭也没吃，能动的伤员，大家抢着给他拿东西送行。因为他在医院里不但是个模范休养员，而且也是个模范工作者，院方给他记了一大功，并奖给他一个光荣的立功证。
