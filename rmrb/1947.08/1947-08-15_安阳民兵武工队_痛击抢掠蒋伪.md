　　Anyang Militia Guerrilla Unit
  　Deals Heavy Blows to Looting Chiang Kai-shek Bandits
    [Report from Anyang] In the battle to trap the enemy in Anyang and protect grain and conscription, the militia company, capture team, guerrilla unit, and district cadre team of the Fifth and Seventh Districts have become stronger and stronger. With very few troops, they have repelled powerful enemy offensives and created a brilliant record of twenty-seven to one. On the 15th of last month, over a thousand enemy troops under Liu Lexian attacked the defense area of the Shao Village District Cadre Team. The District Cadre Captain led a squad to meet the enemy and dealt them a heavy blow. After a day of fierce fighting, they resolutely held their position and repelled the enemy, killing seven. Another enemy force of over a thousand, in coordination with a unit of the Fortieth Army, invaded the area around Chai Ku Village. Our District Chief Wang led the militia guerrilla unit of the Fifth and Seventh Districts in a brave counterattack. They fought fiercely with the enemy from early morning until noon. The capture team of the Fifth District rushed to launch a fierce attack on the enemy. The enemy could not hold on and fled in panic, abandoning the items they had looted from the masses. We took the opportunity to pursue and kill another seven enemies. Our militia suffered no casualties. On the 18th, the puppet Liu Lexian and the puppet Security Third Brigade attacked Xiaomin Village in our Fifth District. Our guerrilla unit, capture team, and a unit of the Seventh District militia ambushed east of Chai Ku Village. When the enemy approached, we concentrated our firepower and fiercely strafed them. The enemy, realizing they had fallen into an ambush, turned around and fled, just as they stepped on two landmines that had been pre-positioned, throwing the enemy into chaos and killing three. In these two battles, it has been verified that twenty-seven enemies, including machine gun shooters and lower ranks, were killed. After these battles, the morale of the militia has greatly improved, encouraging the masses in the border areas to fight against the enemy, and they are cleaning their guns and practicing their skills to inflict greater damage on the enemy.
