    Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 30th. Pyongyang Dispatch: The talks between the Korean Soviet-American Joint Commission regarding the organization of a Korean democratic provisional government began at the end of June and continued until mid-month, but reached a deadlock due to the sabotage by the US representatives. The Soviet delegation leader, Shtykov, issued a statement on the 21st regarding the truth of the matter, refuting the US's rumors, stating: "The point of contention in the talks between the two sides lies in the list of democratic parties and people's organizations participating in the consultation. The Soviet delegation faithfully implemented the Moscow Conference decision and the Molotov-Marshall understanding on resuming the work of the Joint Commission, which stipulates that only Korean democratic parties and people's organizations that do not oppose the Allied powers and the Moscow Conference decision can be invited to participate in the consultation. However, many of the organizations on the list proposed by the US are reactionary organizations that oppose the Moscow decision, many are merely industrial and commercial enterprises and educational administrative organs, and some organizations simply do not exist. For example, the so-called 'Korean Construction and Repair Workers' Union,' with 1.27 million members, cannot be found in Korea, because the total number of workers in Korea is less than one million. Due to the Soviet side's exposure, the US side was forced to admit this fabricated behavior." The statement continued: "The Soviet side proposed that parties and organizations that had signed in support of the Moscow decision on the Korean issue on the one hand, but opposed the Moscow decision and the Korean Trusteeship Committee on the other, could only participate in the talks on organizing a democratic provisional government after repenting. It also suggested that small non-political and purely local groups should not participate, whether in North or South Korea, because there are too many such groups in South Korea, and consulting them one by one would inevitably prolong the work of the commission. However, these suggestions were rejected by the US delegation." The statement pointed out: "This attitude of the US side clearly violates the Moscow decision and the Molotov-Marshall understanding on resuming the work of the Joint Commission."

    因美代表无耻破坏
    朝鲜谈判陷于僵局
    苏代表团长斥美方造谣
    【新华社陕北卅日电】平壤讯：朝鲜苏美共同委员会关于组织朝鲜民主临时政府的会谈，于六月底开始，一直延续到本月中旬，但因美方代表之破坏而陷于僵局。苏方代表团长希齐柯夫于二十一日就此事真相发表声明驳斥美方之造谣称：“双方会谈之争执点，在于参加协商的民主党派与人民团体名单问题。苏联代表团忠实执行莫斯科会议决定和莫洛托夫、马歇尔关于恢复共同委员会工作的谅解，即规定只有不反对盟国和莫斯科会议决定的朝鲜民主党派与人民团体，才能被邀参加协商。但美方所提出的名单中，有许多均系反对莫斯科决定的反动组织，有许多仅系工商企业公司与教育行政机关，甚至有些团体根本不存在，例如具有一百二十七万会员的所谓‘朝鲜建筑修理工人联盟，’在朝鲜就找不到，因为整个朝鲜工人的总数尚不及一百万人。由于苏方的揭穿，美方被迫承认了这一虚构行为。”声明继指出：“苏方曾提议，凡曾一方面签字支持莫斯科关于朝鲜问题决定，但另一方面又反对莫斯科决定、反对朝鲜托管委员会的党派团体、只有在洗心革面后、才能参加商谈组织民主临时政府的会谈。并建议，非政治性与纯地方性的小团体，不论鲜南鲜北均不参加，因鲜南此种团体太多，如一一咨询，势必使委员会工作旷日持久。但这些建议均为美代表团所拒绝，”声明指出：“美方此种态度，显然违反莫斯科决定，和莫洛托夫、马歇尔关于恢复共同委员会工作之谅解”。
