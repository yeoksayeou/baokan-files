　　Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 26th: Guangzhou dispatch: People's militia forces are active in Huiyang, Guangdong. On the morning of the 19th, Liang Guocai, the Chiang-appointed magistrate of Huiyang County, was traveling by truck from Pingshan to Longgang along the Guanghui Highway when it triggered a landmine planted by the militia at Jiangliankeng. Because the truck had already passed the landmine line, only the guards in the truck were killed by the militia. Liang Guocai was injured and fled in panic. All weapons and supplies in the truck were seized by the militia.
　　Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 26th: Shanghai dispatch: Although strikes are prohibited by Chiang Kai-shek's "spy personnel" order, the labor unrest in Shanghai continues to spread to the film industry. The Majestic Theater, Shanghai's largest movie theater, disregarded the livelihoods of its employees and abused its power by hiring privately, causing dissatisfaction among the industry's workers. When the employees requested job security from the management and demanded that employees not be hired or fired arbitrarily, their demands were rejected. A wave of strikes then swept widely through the industry. As of the 24th, twelve major movie theaters had closed due to strikes, and the strikes are continuing to expand.

    【新华社陕北二十六日电】广州讯：广东惠阳民变武装活跃，十九日晨当惠阳蒋记县长梁国材，乘卡车沿广惠公路自坪山赴龙岗，途经蒋联坑时，突触变民之预埋地雷，因车已越出地雷线未，车中卫兵被变民击毙，梁国材受伤落荒而逃，车中所有武器物资悉为变民缴获。
    【新华社陕北二十六日电】沪讯：罢工虽为蒋介石之“线访员”令所禁止，上海工潮仍继续扩展至电影业。上海最大之美琪电影院因不顾职工生活，滥用私人，引起该业职工不满，当职工向资方提出要求保障职业，不得随便雇用或解雇职工时，又遭资方拒绝，罢工浪潮遂于该业中广泛掀起，迄廿四日止已有十二家大电影院因罢工而关门，罢工尚在继续扩大中。
