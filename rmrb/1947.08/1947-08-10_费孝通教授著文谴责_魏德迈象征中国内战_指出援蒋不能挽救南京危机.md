Xinhua News Agency, North Hebei, August 8th: Tianjin News: Liberal Tsinghua University Sociology Professor Fei Xiaotong recently published an article in the Tianjin Dagongbao newspaper entitled "Evening Chats to Kill Time," exposing the American imperialist Weidemaier’s so-called investigation as a continuation of aiding Chiang in the civil war, stating: "Without a doubt, he is here to participate in the Far East war. I see no other possibility. For China, Weidemaier symbolizes civil war, which is based on what he has done in China. He equipped the Nationalist (Chiang) army, he transported the Nationalist (Chiang) army to accept surrender, he transported the Nationalist (Chiang) army to the Northeast, and he sent American troops to guard the inland transportation routes. Whoever denies these denies history." Regarding the Chiang Kai-shek clique's begging their American masters for aid to wage civil war, Fei used a sarcastic tone to depict their ugly state, saying: "But some people in China believe that if Weidemaier doesn't come, the situation will be troublesome. Now that a great general has flown in from afar, America is indeed a good friend." Regarding the future of American aid to Chiang's civil war, Fei believes: "Military force cannot solve China's problems (referring to using military force to save the Chiang Kai-shek clique's ruling crisis). In the past, America sent bullets and dispatched advisory groups, but it was still not enough. Now, unless they send troops, and even then, it would take two to three million to be effective. But such aid to China (Chiang) would only prolong the civil war and make the Chinese people suffer for a few more years. And in the eyes of the world's people, America would become a world sinner. Weidemaier's trip may be a second Gordon—a historical sinner (note: Gordon was a British general who commanded the Qing Dynasty and British imperialist counter-revolutionary forces in attacking the Taiping Heavenly Kingdom revolutionary people). Good luck or bad luck, that is for Weidemaier to judge himself."

Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, August 8th: Nanjing News: A British parliamentary delegation will visit China in early October. The delegation includes members of both the House of Lords and the House of Commons, including Labour Party members Lord Ammon, McLeish, Harrison, Liberal Party members Lord Amuri, Roberts, and Conservative Party member Air Vice-Marshal Harvey. The delegation will travel extensively in China, visiting Beiping, Tianjin, Shenyang, Qingdao, Shanghai, Taiwan, Guangzhou, Hankou, Chongqing, and other places.

    费孝通教授著文谴责
    魏德迈象征中国内战
    指出援蒋不能挽救南京危机
    【新华社冀中八日电】天津讯：自由主义者清华大学社会系教授费孝通，顷在此间大公报以“消炎夜谈”为题，揭穿美帝国主义者魏德迈假调查之名，实行继续援蒋内战称：“毫无置疑，他是来参加远东战火的，除此而外，再看不出其他可能。对于中国，魏德迈是象征着内战的，这是他在中国的事实给他做下的根据。装备国（蒋）军的是他，运送国（蒋）军去受降的是他，运输国（蒋）军到东北的是他，派美军守住关内交通的是他，谁否认这些就是否认历史。”对于蒋家小朝廷乞怜美国主人援助进行内战，费氏以讥讽口吻刻划出其丑态称：“但在中国另一些人，则认为魏德迈不来，局面真有些麻烦，现在大将从天外飞来，美国确够朋友。”对于美援蒋内战前途，费氏认为：“军事是不能解决中国问题的（按：指以军事挽回蒋家小朝廷统治危机），已往美国送了子弹，派了参谋团来，还是不够的，现在除非他们出兵，出兵也得两三百万才济事，但这样援华（蒋），不过徒然延长内战，使中国人多苦难几年吧。而在世界人民面前，美国则成为世界罪人了。魏德迈此行也许是戈登第二——历史罪人（按：戈登为统帅满清及英帝国主义反革命武装进攻太平天国革命人民的英国将领），好运还是坏运，这就要魏德迈自己评定了。”
    【新华社陕北八日电】南京讯：英国议会访华团将于十月初来华，该团人选包括上下两院议员，让有工党议员亚蒙勋爵、麦克里雄、哈里逊，自由党议员阿穆里勋爵、罗柏兹及联合党议员哈尔维空军少将。该团将在中国作广泛旅行，访问北平、天津、沈阳、青岛、上海、台湾、广州、汉口、重庆等地。
