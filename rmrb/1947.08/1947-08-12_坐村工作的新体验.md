New Experiences in Village-Sitting Work
    Li Fengchen, Chen Wei

　　"Village-sitting" is a new aspect of our political work. We don't yet have a mature and systematic approach to this work. For a long time, "village-sitting" was merely passive waiting. We only went to the village cadres to apologize after problems arose, or to educate and explain things to those who violated discipline. There was no proactive and positive prevention. Therefore, during this stage, we felt that we were putting in a lot of effort but not gaining much.

    During this southward journey, we experienced the following issues:

    (1) Showing Consideration and Understanding the Specific Difficulties of Village Cadres:

    According to our understanding in Zhang Village: Just the three units of Zhi ×× require ten militiamen and seven or eight village cadres every day to handle their trivial matters. Especially when the troops have just arrived and the next morning, this is when the units need the most things and are the busiest. Sometimes the village cadres don't even have time to eat.

    Some logistics personnel, due to fatigue from marching, are anxious to find someone to get fodder and get things settled early so they can rest. If they can't get what they want, they get angry, put on airs, and blame the village cadres.

    Some logistics cadres and personnel don't even bother to buy oil, vegetables, or carry firewood themselves, and they ask the village office to send people to do it, which unnecessarily increases the labor burden on the village and the trouble for the village cadres.

    (2) The Spirit that Village-Sitting Cadres Should Possess:

    First and foremost, they must have a clear and firm spirit of serving the people. Everything should be based on the principle of reducing the burden on the masses, and they should boldly stop those who violate discipline and demand excessive labor.

    Secondly, they must understand some of the regulations of the supply system in order to correctly handle specific issues such as exchanging rice for feed, or exchanging rice for noodles, and exchanging wet firewood for dry firewood.

    Furthermore, they must have a working spirit that is not afraid of hardship and is patient. They must get up early and go to bed late, and they must solve the difficulties faced by the village cadres in supporting us before worrying about their own fatigue.

    (3) Several Key Points that Village-Sitting Cadres Must Grasp:

    1. Before the troops depart, they should go ahead with the billeting personnel and arrive at the station first. First, hold a meeting with the village cadres, tell them what the troops will need and the approximate number of items, and some working methods. Then the village cadres can prepare separately. Only by doing this can we prevent the village cadres from being unable to cope temporarily and being busy all the time; and the troops can also avoid violating discipline because they are anxious to get supplies, and both the logistics personnel and the village cadres can get some rest earlier.

    2. Three key periods of village-sitting time (not just sitting in the village office all day long).

    1. When the troops have just arrived, it is the most chaotic and problems are most likely to occur. This is when the most people from various units want things (fodder, noodles, livestock feeding tools, etc.). 2. The second morning after stationing, many units need firewood again (mainly the kitchen staff at this time). 3. Check before departure to make sure that the village expenses and our procedures are clear, so as not to increase the village's new burden.

    3. Strictly emphasize the method of exchanging existing grain and firewood coupons for feed, noodles, grass, and firewood, instead of using the method of keeping accounts and settling them before leaving, to avoid unnecessary trouble for both parties and to prevent logistics cadres from taking advantage of loopholes.

    4. Think about and study work methods for the village cadres, and constantly educate the logistics personnel who want things to abide by discipline. Overcome the phenomenon of wantonly demanding things and demanding excessive labor from both the perspective of finding solutions and education.

    5. Implement certain disciplinary measures for individual members who have seriously violated discipline. The leadership should support the village-sitting cadres to warn others.

    (4) Several Practical Proofs:

    Due to the persistence and strictness of the village-sitting work, the relationship between the army and the people has been closer during the march, and the phenomenon of village cadres asking for accounts after the troops leave has been overcome.

    The phenomenon of randomly assigning civilian laborers to buy things and carry firewood has been overcome. Even Comrade Jiang Jiashu, the logistics chief who used to like to send civilian laborers the most, personally carried firewood on his back.

    We think of ways for the village cadres and support them, and use discipline to punish those who violate discipline, so the village cadres are especially close to us. Whenever they have difficulties, they actively seek us to find solutions together.

    Strict and correct enforcement of discipline will further expand the influence of our army. For example, in Zhang Village, we punished a logistics officer who made things difficult for the village cadres, apologized to the masses in a meeting, and made the emancipated masses further realize the respect that their own troops have for them, so they automatically consoled us (chicken eggs, vegetables, etc.) to respond to our apology.

### 坐村工作的新体验

　　坐村工作的新体验
    李锋晨、陈伟
    “坐村”是我们政治工作的一个新内容，这一工作我们还没有成熟与系统的一套办法，开始很长时间，“坐村”仅是被动的等待，有了问题再去向村干道歉，给犯纪律的教育解释，没有主动与积极御防，所以此一阶段我们深感费劲不小，收获不大。
    此次南下途中，我们体验了以下的几个问题：
    （一）体贴与了解村干部的具体困难：
    据在张村的了解：只××三个单位，每天经常须有十个自卫队员，七、八个村干专门支应他们的一些琐事，特别当部队刚一驻下，及第二天早晨，这个时候各单位要东西的最多，事也最繁忙，村干有时连饭也没工夫吃。
    有些杂务人员因行军疲劳，到时急于找人要草料办妥早些休息，一旦不能如愿即发脾气、耍态度、责难村干。
    有些杂务干部与杂务人员，连买油、菜及抬柴草，都不亲自动手，还叫村公所派人给作，无故增加了村中的劳力负担，及村干的麻烦。
    （二）坐村干部应具备的精神：
    首先必有明确而坚定的为人民服务的精神，一切应从减轻群众负担为准绳，大胆的去制止那些违犯纪律与支差的行为。
    其次要了解供给制度上的一些规定，以正确处理以米兑料，或以米折面，及以湿柴折干柴等具体问题。
    再则要有不怕吃苦耐心的工作精神，必早起晚睡，要不顾自己疲劳的先去解决村干在支应我们时的困难问题。
    （三）坐村干部要掌握的几个关节：
    一、部队出发前要和设营人员一块先头走，到达驻地，先开村干会，告诉他们部队来后所需之物品及大约之数目，和一些工作办法，然后村干再分头去作准备，只有作好了这一步，才能不致使村干部临时难以应付忙个不休；而部队人员也免得因急于要物而犯纪律，并能让杂务人员与村干双方都得以早些休息。
    二、坐村时间的三个环节（并不是一天到晚死坐村公所）。
    １、部队刚驻下最乱，问题也最易发生，各单位要东西（草料、面、喂牲口用具等）的人正是最多的时候。２、驻后第二清早，各单位要柴的又多起来（这时主要是伙房人员）。３、临出发前的检查，定要将村中开支和我们手续弄清，以免增加村中新的负担。
    三、严格与强调以现粮、柴票兑料、面、草柴的办法，不再用记帐等临走时再清的办法，免掉双方不必要的麻烦，并可防止杂务干部从中钻空子。
    四、多给村干想与研究工作办法及随时教育要东西的杂务人员遵守纪律，从想办法及教育的两方面去克服乱要东西乱支差的现象。
    五、对个别犯纪律较重的分子要执行一定的纪律处分，领导上要给坐村干部撑腰，以警惕别人。
    （四）几个实际证明：
    由于坚持与严格了坐村工作，在沿途行军中密切了军民关系及克服了部队出发后面村干还要帐的现象。
    乱支差要民夫买东西抬柴草的现象克服了，连过去最好派民夫的杂务长蒋家树同志也亲自背面扛柴了。
    给村干想办法给他们撑腰，用纪律制裁犯纪律的分子，所以使村干特别亲近我们。一有困难就主动找我们共同想办法解决问题。
    严格正确的执行纪律，我军影响更会扩大，如驻张村我们处分一个为难村干的杂务人员，开会向群众道歉，叫翻身后的群众更进一步认识到自己队伍对他们的尊重，所以他们又自动慰劳（鸡子、菜等）来回答我们的歉意。
