　　Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 29th—Since the Chiang government issued the "General Mobilization Order," it has intensified its extortion, bringing even greater disasters to the business community in the Chiang-controlled areas. According to continuous reports by the Tianjin Dagongbao, business in Beiping is increasingly bleak. At present, apart from daily necessities such as coal, grain, and oil, no one is interested in anything else. Most businessmen say that the depression in business is really due to the poverty of the people and their inability to bear the extortion. Last month, in order to build the Beiping city defense works, the Chiang government strictly limited each business to pay a huge sum of 3.2 billion yuan before the 20th of the month; at the same time, the Chiang Kai-shek Finance Bureau levied a summer business tax of 1 billion yuan and a supplementary spring tax arrearage of 1.6 billion yuan. These items alone amounted to nearly 7 billion yuan, suffocating the merchants. In Taiyuan, after more than 150 businesses closed from June to early July, there are still many more closing or in danger of closing. The turnover of funds in the market is even more difficult, and even small and medium-sized businessmen have to borrow at high interest rates. The lives of the citizens are already extremely difficult, but the bandit Yan employs all kinds of extortion methods, and recently announced that the price of meat and eggs has doubled, and the added price will be used to "comfort the soldiers." Jinghai, which is under the direct control of Chiang's army guns, has basically no market. There are a total of 109 large and small shops in the area. Some have posted notices saying "Closed for Business" at the door; others are selling off goods, preparing to close. As of the 22nd of last month, 60 shops had applied for closure. The Chamber of Commerce has also closed down. In Yulin, Northern Shaanxi, more than 200 shops closed in the first five or six days of last month.

　　不堪蒋党勒索
  　商店纷纷倒闭
    【新华社陕北二十九日电】蒋政府颁布“总动员令”后，加紧勒索，给蒋区商业界带来更深重的灾难。据天津大公报连日报导：北平市商业日形萧条，目前除日用必需品如煤、粮、油等外，其余已无人问津。一般商人均表示：商业之不景气，实由于人民穷困与不堪勒索所致。上月蒋政府为修筑北平城防工事，即严限各商号于二十日前付三十二亿元巨款；同时蒋记财政局又征收夏季业税达一十亿元，并补征春季欠额十六亿元。单以上数项，即几达七十亿元，压得商人喘不过气来。太原自六月至七月初，商号闭一百五十余家后，继续倒闭和处于倒闭危机者尚多。市面资金周转更形困难，一般中小商人虽出高利亦借得。市民生活本已极端困苦，但阎贼勒索花样百出，近宣布肉类鸡蛋加价一倍，而所加之价钱概作“慰劳军人”之用。处于蒋军枪杆直接控制下的静海，已根本没有市面，该地共有大小商号一百零九家，有的门口已贴了“停止营业”的条子；有的正在抛售货物，准备关门。迄上月二十二日止，已有六十家请求歇业。商会随之亦已关门大吉。陕北之榆林，上月初五、六天内即有二百多家商号关门。
