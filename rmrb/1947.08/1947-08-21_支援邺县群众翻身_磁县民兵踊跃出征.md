　　Supporting the Masses of Ye County to Overthrow Oppression
  　Ci County Militiamen Enthusiastically Volunteer to Set Out
    [Our Newspaper, Ci County News] To support Ye County and protect the masses in the newly liberated areas in their overthrow of oppression, and to ensure their peace of mind in production, the militiamen of this county have volunteered to set out, with three batches of approximately a thousand people having already departed. The Fifth Company of the Second Batch of militiamen, after arriving in the county and understanding the enemy and special agent activities in the local area, took the initiative to launch a fierce attack on the enemy in the Ershilipu area, about twenty miles from the enemy. Under the slogan of "Kill and wound the enemy as much as possible," each and every one of them competed to establish merit for the people. From early July to August 10th, in forty days, they fought the enemy more than twenty times around Guocun, repelling the enemy each time. They killed or wounded one enemy each time, captured alive twenty-seven enemy special agents (including two captains), and over five hundred landlords. They seized ten long and short guns, over a hundred rounds of ammunition, one warhorse, and intercepted sixteen landlord carts, over four hundred bundles, and two thousand catties of medicinal materials. We suffered no casualties, and only consumed over four hundred rounds of ammunition. Everyone was smiling happily, full of confidence in victory. (Bao Xin)
