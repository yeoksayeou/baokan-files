　　Yellow River Flood Prevention Notes

　　Arriving on the south bank of the Yellow River, I encountered the incessant bombing by Chiang planes; the bombs fell on the newly constructed dangerous projects, further intensifying the irrepressible resentment of the residents along the river. An old river worker at Zhongdui grabbed me and asked, "If we catch Chiang Kai-shek, will he also be handed over to the masses to deal with?" Now their thoughts about Chiang Kai-shek are very simple!
　　On August 5th, Zhongdui was under the round-the-clock bombing of three Chiang planes, but people didn't seem to fear this kind of bombing and strafing. In each short interval between strafing runs, ox carts and dike workers, fully loaded with stones and sorghum stalks, surged onto the riverbank. At night, although Chiang planes still flew low in the dark sky, the crowds reinforcing the dike only scattered briefly when the machine guns strafed; as soon as the strafing stopped, they calmly continued to build the fascine surfaces of the water dams. Zhongdui has two small dams. The southern one resembles a large python, stretching all the way to the edge of the main current, while the northern one is formed by eight connected fascine surfaces. Director Meng told me that before July, when the Chiang troops had not yet retreated, both of these dams were built during the enemy's "mopping-up" operations. On May 4th, the enemy's "mopping-up" had just ended. At six o'clock in the morning on the 5th, the second fascine surface of the northern dam suddenly started to shake and gradually sink. By eight o'clock, it had sunk below the water surface. The surging current rushed straight over it and pounded against the third fascine surface. People hurriedly went up the dike. The Farmers' Association Chairman, Zhong Weichun, was the first to jump onto the fascine surface. Others hurriedly extended shovels to pull him back, but he didn't take them. He only urged people to quickly get down to the fascine, finally stopping them from coming down. He hurriedly moved sorghum stalks down to fill the gap, filling one foot and sinking another. They filled and sank continuously for three days and nights without stopping, finally stabilizing this surface. Suddenly on the fourth day, the other seven fascine surfaces all began to shake. Unable to attend to everything at once, and exhausted to the point of not being able to stand up straight, they were in great danger. Chiang troops launched a three-pronged attack, with the vanguard already arriving at Li Gai and Luo Lou, only two miles away. Gunfire could be clearly heard. Some people panicked; if they let go, the fascine surface would all be washed away, and the manor houses would be finished. Regardless of how urgent the gunfire was, they quickly repaired the dam on the south side. This saved the seven fascine surfaces on the north side. This emergency reinforcement work lasted for twenty-five days. During this period, they were subjected to such urgent "mopping-up" operations by Chiang troops for a total of nineteen days and were also strafed by Chiang planes once.
　　Upstream from Zhongdui, the Jiangsu Dam's river channel curves into a horseshoe shape. The river, being constricted, pounds against both banks. It is the first dangerous project where the Yellow River flows into the border region of Hebei, Shandong, and Henan. The emergency reinforcement project there was also carried out within the artillery range of the Chiang troops' stronghold, only five miles away. On the 29th of last month, the people's armed forces repelled three regiments of Chiang troops before they could plug the three breaches in the riverbank that had been dug open. The residents along the river not only had to constantly watch for every change in the river's flow but also had to simultaneously carry out "flood prevention" from the air and on the ground. These serious struggles make the Yellow River seem even more like a long, winding front line. Under the dim moonlight, I crossed the river from the Yanji dangerous project and landed on the shore next to a swamp. This swamp is the edge of the area flooded by the riverbed. Some of the villages in it have already been washed away, some have been partially destroyed, and some have fortunately survived because of their higher elevation. At this time, because the water level had dropped, each village stood in the swamp like an island. Some of these "islands" were still in the process of relocation and rescue work. After traversing this twenty-mile swamp, I arrived on the north bank before dawn. Not far from the shore, the huts of the dike patrolmen were lined up one after another. The young people along the river were beginning to come up to the dike to spend the flood season. They built their huts under the shade of the trees, digging a simple air-raid shelter next to them. From morning to night, they anxiously watched the movements of the river surface. At this time, they were worried about the sudden drop of two meters in the river water.

　　黄河防泛记
    天纵
    到黄河南岸，遇到蒋机的不停息的轰炸；炸弹落在新修的险工上面，更加使沿河居民的愤恨不可压制。仲堆一位河工曾执地追问我：“捉住蒋介石是不是也交给群众处理呢？”现在他们对蒋介石的想法已经很简单了！
    八月五日，仲＠堆整天在三架蒋机的轮番轰炸之下，可是人们似乎并不恐惧蒋机这种轰炸扫射，在每个短促的扫射间隙，都有满载石头、高梁杆的牛车和堤工涌上河堤。一到夜里，虽然蒋机仍不停的在黑空低飞，但堤上的抢险人群，只在机枪扫射时才散开一下，扫射一停止，便又泰然地修筑着水坝的埽面。仲＠堆有两道小坝，南面的一道象一条大蟒一直抵到大流边上，北面的一道是由八个埽面联成的。孟处长告诉我：在七月以前，蒋军还没有退走，这两道坝就都在敌人的“扫荡”中修成。五月四日，敌人的“扫荡”刚刚过去，五日早晨六钟点，北面那道坝的第二个埽面忽然动摇起来，渐渐下沉。到八点钟，便沉入水面，直冲过来的滚滚大流，已越过它而向第三个埽面冲激了，人们慌忙上堤。农会长仲维春第一个跳下埽面，别人忙伸过铁铲去拉他，他接也不接，只叫人赶快下埽，到底把人喊住，匆匆忙忙搬高粱秆往下填，填了一尺又下沉一天，一面填一面沉，一直填了三天三夜没停，才把这面埽稳住。忽然第四天，其他的七面埽又一齐动摇起来，顾住这面顾不住那面，人又都乏得直不起腰，正在非常危险的时候，蒋军分兵三路出动，先头部队已到了只隔二里地的李垓和罗楼，枪声已清晰可闻，有些人发慌了；要是一松手，埽面便将全部漂走，庄园房屋就都完了。他们不管枪声如何紧急，赶快又把南面的那道＠修起来，这才救下了北面的七个埽面。这次的抢险，共工作了二十五天。在这期间，遭到蒋军如此紧迫的“扫荡”共经过十九日，还被蒋机扫射过一次。
    仲＠堆上流的江苏坝河道曲成一个马蹄形，河流被束缚，便向两岸冲击，是黄河流入冀鲁豫境的第一道险工，那里的抢险工程，也是在只离蒋军据点五里，在蒋军的大炮射程之内进行的。在上月廿九日，人民武装击退了蒋军三个团，才抢堵了被扒开的三处河堤。沿河居民不但要时刻注视着河流的每一变化，还得从空中和阵地上同时进行“防泛”。这些严重的斗争使黄河显得更加象一条绵长的战线。在朦胧月色之下，我从阎集险工过河，在一个沼泽边靠岸。这沼泽是河床被淹区域的边缘，其中有的村庄已经冲毁，有的冲毁了一部分，有的因为地势较高幸告无恙。这时，因为水位下降各个村庄又都象岛屿一样立在泥沼之中。这些“岛屿”，有的还正在办理迁移抢救工作。行过这二十里的沼泽，于破晓前到达了北岸。岸上不远，一个一个的排列着护堤人员们的窝棚。沿河的青年们，开始上堤来渡泛期了。他们把窝棚搭在树荫底下，旁边挖一个简陋的躲飞机的掩体，从早到晚焦灼的凝视着河面的动静，这时，他们正在为河水的突然下降二公尺而疑虑着。
