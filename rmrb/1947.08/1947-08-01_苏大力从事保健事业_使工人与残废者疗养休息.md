Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 28th: Moscow dispatch: This year, the Soviet government is vigorously engaged in healthcare for workers and the disabled. This year, millions of workers nationwide will rest in trade union sanatoriums and rest homes. State insurance funds amounting to 15 billion rubles from the national budget will be used to maintain the expenses of trade union members in sanatoriums and rest homes, and to restore and construct new sanatoriums and rest homes. The Sochi rest home, with the most beautiful scenery and the best equipment in the Soviet Union, will welcome 100,000 people this year to spend their holidays. This year, two million school-age children have been sent to summer camps. A large amount of funds has also been allocated to various trade unions to subsidize members' food and nutrition, and to maintain night sanatoriums where workers can rest after work. The Russian Federation has been allocated 20.6 million rubles in social support this year, more than half of last year's amount, most of which will be used to subsidize war and labor invalids. The state's full-scale treatment of the disabled has improved the health of many disabled people last year and reduced the total number by 5.4%. This year, 54,000 disabled people will be sent to sanatoriums, while tens of thousands of others will receive special care in hospitals. Tens of thousands of disabled people who have recovered have received special craft training in various factories and schools.
