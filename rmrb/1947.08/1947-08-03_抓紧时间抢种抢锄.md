Since the beginning of summer, some areas have received rain successively, while in the Taihang First and Fifth Districts, the Jinnan Third District, and parts of the Taiyue-Ji-Lu-Yu region, there has been a persistent drought. In some places, the drought has not ended, and has been followed by hail and insect plagues, a very serious situation. However, under the leadership of the Party, various localities have mobilized the masses to carry water for planting, dry planting, repairing canals, and digging wells, rushing to plant and replant, planning for conservation, and actively fighting the disaster, achieving considerable success. Recently, the entire region has generally received soaking rain, greatly increasing the production enthusiasm and confidence of the masses. As long as the local leaders can promptly grasp the current urgent demand of the masses for rushing to plant and weed, concentrate their efforts, organize leadership, and carry out a sudden campaign to plant a large number of autumn vegetables such as red and white radishes, turnips, and mustard greens, some areas can still catch up to plant millet and buckwheat and other late crops. The question before us is: whether to ignore the masses' demand, shout about the severity of the disaster without actively leading the masses in production, thereby missing the opportunity and causing irreparable losses? Or to grasp the masses' demand, actively lead the masses to rise up and overcome the disaster, increase grain production, and lay a solid material foundation for the patriotic self-defense war? There can be no more hesitation now. Production is inherently a seasonal task, and these next ten to fifteen days are an extremely critical juncture of decisive significance.

The time is extremely pressing. We call on the entire region to immediately and universally organize a movement to inspect and eliminate wasteland. In areas severely affected by disaster, it is necessary to concentrate forces to organize the masses to rush to plant and replant late crops and autumn vegetables in large quantities, eliminating all blank spaces. Each person planting two or three fen of autumn vegetables can be a big help. In these aspects, some areas in Taihang and Jinnan have achieved great results. In Anyang, Cixian, Changzhi, Huguan, and other places, there have been replanting two or three times, demonstrating the high level of awareness and the tenacious spirit of the emancipated peasants in overcoming the disaster, which is worthy of universal promotion. We believe that the severity of the disaster should never be ignored, but neither should we be pessimistic and disheartened because of it. The Taihang Xinhua Daily called for a duel with the disaster, which is completely filled with a spirit of active combat for production and self-salvation. If we take this spirit to encourage and organize the enthusiasm of the broad masses for production after the rain, we will surely be able to overcome the disaster. Let us make another effort and strive to achieve what Jinzhong of Taiyue proposed: "Strive for an eighty percent harvest in a fifty percent year."

In order to complete this urgent and arduous task, the central link is that our entire Party, government, army, and people must first be fully mobilized ideologically, clearly recognizing that the poor harvest in some areas is certain, but we must still seize the opportunity to find all possible ways to remedy the situation, opposing the negative saying that "it's no use anyway." Just as the disaster cannot scare us, the soaking rain should not increase our paralysis. Instead, it should add fuel to our production efforts. We should continue to conserve, and especially step up production. Even in areas where the weather is favorable and the crops are good, we must never be paralyzed by this, but strive to increase production. However, all methods of increasing production must seize the next ten to fifteen days. If we want to have something to harvest in the autumn and have a large harvest, it will not work to miss the current shock campaign.

The time is pressing, and the task is arduous. The leaders of various localities must elevate this work of rushing to plant and weed and eliminating wasteland to the first place of all work. This is the demand of the masses, and also the demand of the war. In addition to the necessary war services, all non-urgent work and meetings that are not time-sensitive should be temporarily put aside until after the Beginning of Autumn. Moreover, even war services should be very economical in manpower and precisely calculated, implementing a large-scale production and war participation labor exchange to save manpower, material resources, and animal power to the minimum. Some work can be remedied if it is missed, but if the opportunity is lost for this sudden campaign, it can never be compensated this year. Therefore, it is necessary to fully mobilize all possible manpower and animal power to create a surge in rushing to plant and weed. In new areas lacking mutual aid experience, it is now necessary to take advantage of this upsurge in rushing to plant and weed to correct past deviations, and to timely organize and develop the mutual aid movement according to the principles of voluntariness and equivalence.

    抓紧时间抢种抢锄
    入夏以来，有些地区已先后得雨，而在太行一、五分区，冀南三分区和太岳冀鲁豫的局部地区，则一直苦旱，有的地方旱灾未已，更继之以雹灾虫灾，情况颇为严重；但另方面，在党的领导下，各地发动群众担水点种，干种，修渠凿井，抢种补种，计划节约，向灾荒积极斗争，取得不少成绩；最近，全区已普获透雨，群众生产情绪和信心大大提高。只要各地领导能及时抓住群众当前抢种抢锄的迫切要求，集中全力，组织领导，突击进行，大量种植红白萝卜、蔓菁、芥菜等秋菜，有些地区还赶得上种黍子荞麦等晚庄稼。摆在眼前的问题：到底是忽视群众这一要求空喊灾荒严重而不积极领导群众生产以致错过时机，造成不可补救的损失呢？还是掌握群众这一要求，积极带领群众起来战胜灾荒，增产粮食，给爱国自卫战奠定坚固的物质基础呢？现在是再也不能犹豫了，生产本来就是季节性的工作，而在今后这十天半月内更是有着决定意义的紧急关头。
    时机是异常紧迫，我们号召全区：立即普遍组织一次检查荒地消灭荒地的运动，在灾荒严重区域，必须集中力量组织群众大量抢种补种晚庄稼和秋菜，消灭一切空白地。每人能种上二、三分秋菜就能顶大事情。在这些方面，太行和冀南某些地区都很有成绩，在安阳、磁县、长治、壶关等地，有补种过二、三次的，表现了翻身农民高度觉悟战胜灾荒的顽强精神，值得普遍发扬。我们认为对于灾情的严重绝不应熟视无睹，但也绝不要因此悲观丧气。太行新华日报曾号召向灾荒进行决斗，这里完全充满了一种生产自救积极战斗的精神，我们拿了这种精神去鼓舞与组织广大群众在雨后的生产积极性，就一定能战胜灾荒。再努一把力，让我们全区一致争取做到象太岳晋城提出的：“五成年景争取八成收”。
    为了要完成这一紧急而繁重的任务，中心一环，便是我们党政军民全体必须首先从思想上充分动员起来，明确认识若干地区的歉收是肯定了，但仍必须抓紧时机想一切办法来补救，反对那种“反正是不行了”的消极说法。正如灾荒不能把我们吓倒一样，下了透雨也不应给我们增加麻痹，而是要在我们生产劲头上加油，我们仍应继续节约，尤须加紧生产，即使在风雨调和田禾尚好的地区，也绝不能以此麻痹，而应力求增产，但是一切增产的办法，必须抓紧最近十天半月的时间，要想秋季有东西可收和收的东西多，放过目前的突击运动是不行的。
    时机紧迫，任务繁重，各地领导必须把这次的突击抢种抢锄消灭荒地的工作提到一切工作的第一位来，这是群众要求，也是战争要求。除了必要的战争勤务外，一切没有时间性的不紧急的工作和集会都应暂时放一放，等过了立秋再说，而且即便是战勤差务也应十分节省民力精确计算，实行生产参战大变工，将人力物力畜力节约到最低限度。有些工作误了还可以补救，而这一次的突击如果失去时机，在今年却是再也无法补偿。因此，必须以全力把一切可能的人力畜力全部组织起来，造成抢种抢锄的热潮，新区缺乏互助经验，现在必须趁此抢种抢锄热潮纠正过去偏向，根据自愿与等价的原则及时组织与发展互助运动。
