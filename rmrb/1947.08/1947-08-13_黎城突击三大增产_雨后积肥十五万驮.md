　　【Licheng News from Our Newspaper】After a thorough rain fell across the county on the 28th, heroic Party members in various villages responded to the call of the Party committee and launched three major production increase campaigns: sowing vegetables, weeding seedlings, and accumulating manure. In just ten days, the county collectively replanted 13,930 mu of late-season crops (including barren land, gaps in cornfields, and wheat fields), broadcast 2,980 mu of buckwheat, 7,820 mu of rapeseed, harvested 3,100 mu of autumn vegetables, and 30 mu of "Sixty-Day Yellow" corn. All barren land and gaps were eliminated, and 500 mu of wasteland were collectively reclaimed for sowing vegetables. The 24,229 mu of "Golden Queen" corn have been universally weeded twice and received one top dressing. In the Fifth and Sixth Districts, 5,000 mu have been weeded three times. The 43,997 mu of local corn have generally been weeded once, and two-thirds have been weeded twice and received top dressing. The 20,000 mu of cotton have been weeded three times and have undergone defoliation and branch trimming. Cotton in Cheyuan Village has been weeded seven times. The 5,900 mu of "811" millet have been weeded twice. The Taipei base point in the Second District even applied milk fertilizer once. The entire county aims to weed corn three times, millet twice, and cotton four times universally (these figures include work done before the rain). After the rain, the county accumulated a total of 150,000 loads of manure, laying a solid foundation for expanding wheat fields this year. The movement has the following three characteristics:

    First, heroic Party members take the lead, organizing all able-bodied men and women to launch a blitz of sowing vegetables, weeding seedlings, and accumulating manure. Hero Huo Cangze from Baojiajiao recounted at the liberated farmers' meeting that in 1943, his family of five sowed two mu of rapeseed. They ate it throughout the winter, and in the spring, they exchanged it for five large dou of rice, surviving the severe famine. The branch of Duanjiazhuang in the Second District called for "Bran and vegetables can help survive famine, half a mu of rapeseed per person can help overcome the disaster," and under the leadership of Party members, a campaign to sow half a mu of vegetables per person was launched, completing it in three days. Dong Taoqi, a labor hero from Wangjiazhuang, proposed the slogan at the meeting of activists in the village: "Weeding millet three times yields nine dou of rice for every ten." Under his leadership, three major benefits of weeding seedlings after the rain were identified: (1) It hasn't rained for half a year, and weeds will definitely sprout this autumn. Weeding once more will prevent them from seeding, keeping the ground clean next spring. (2) Weeding now while it's raining nourishes both the soil and the seedlings. (3) More weeding will yield more grain in the autumn. Under the impetus of the old hero, the entire district universally completed two weedings, with some already conducting three. Hero Wang Jucai from the Third District proposed the slogan "Weed until the skin breaks during dog days, better than plowing once in the autumn." Now is the time during dog days to weed and fertilize more, striving to yield an extra five sheng of grain per mu in the autumn. The women of Beiliu had the slogan "Women organized are better than men." Under the organizational leadership of heroes Liu Zhongjing, Wang Xiaoping, and others, all young and middle-aged women in the village stopped weaving, collectively reclaimed wasteland, and sowed vegetables, eliminating barren patches. Baiyu proposed the slogan "Take advantage of the water to compost manure" immediately after the rain stopped, and the entire village composted 2,000 loads of manure in one afternoon. All able-bodied men and women in the county have been drawn into this three major production increase campaign.

    Second, the masses of cadres and people throughout the county have a very clear understanding of the need to produce more grain. The leadership has grasped this ideological requirement of the broad masses, and the county has universally convened poor peasant and farm laborer meetings to understand the current famine situation, mobilize extensive vegetable planting, and overcome the apathy of a few through current affairs education. Hero Li Enkui from Houdiyu said: "Just grab the seedlings. The rain came late. In previous years, millet had weeds by the sixth day of the sixth month, but this year that won't work. The corn is waist-high, but weeds are sprouting seed heads. This year, the famine is certain. No matter how well we harvest, it'll only be half a year's yield." Wang Aiying from Fengzituo said: "This year, it's not enough to just have enough grain for ourselves. We also have to ensure that our army doesn't lack grain. People are iron, and food is steel. How can we fight Chiang Kai-shek without grain? We must produce well." "Bran and vegetables can help survive famine," and "Rush to sow buckwheat and rapeseed to overcome the disaster" have become consistent slogans throughout the county, and muddled thinking has disappeared in the broad movement.

    Third, the issues of wages and seeds have been resolved, and technology has been thoroughly implemented. Reducing wages is the main key to deep plowing and meticulous cultivation. This spring, wages in various villages were generally high, with each work-day being worth more than six jin of millet, and some even reaching twelve jin. During weeding, the disaster situation became more severe, and every household complained that wages were too high and they couldn't afford the millet. Even households with labor power, besides counting their own labor, calculated how many jin of millet it would take to weed one mu of land, and households without labor power didn't want to weed at all. During weeding, wages were reduced in conjunction with the rectification of mutual aid. Gao Hanzen, a labor hero from the Second District, guided the liberated farmers in specifically calculating accounts during the rectification of mutual aid. During the sowing season, a liberated farmer paid nine large dou of millet in wages, while a landlord received one shi and four dou, clarifying class viewpoints. Each work-day was reduced to four jin, and it was determined that future work would mainly be exchanged for work. The millet owed during weeding, which could not be paid in wages, would be repaid in the autumn. Currently, wages throughout the county have been clearly defined as work exchanged for work and have been reduced to four or five jin or less. The cooperative completely resolved the seed problem for replanting late-season crops. The cooperative in the city sent a special person to Wuxiang to buy four shi of buckwheat seeds and 150 jin of rapeseed, selling them to the masses at the original price. Therefore, the county replanted 14,000 mu of late-season crops, and there were no difficulties with seeds.

    Technical issues were thoroughly implemented throughout the entire blitz movement. For example, the Taipei base point in the Second District researched weeding and top dressing techniques. Sesame cake fertilizer was spread along the ridges, five cakes per mu, followed by another weeding, and the fertilizer quickly took effect. For fertilizing corn, the soil around the corn was dug into cake-shaped depressions, the fertilizer was placed inside, and covered with soil, so that the corn could easily absorb the fertilizer. When the corn seedlings were small, fertilizer was applied closer to the plant, and when they were larger, fertilizer was applied further away. When weeding corn, the soil was piled up higher to protect the seedlings from being knocked down by heavy rain and to nourish the soil. Jin Yuliang from Xishuiyang promoted cotton protection techniques, requiring cotton to be weeded four to six times and topped and defoliated on time. Tinghepu researched manure accumulation techniques during the rain, using a method of mixing soil, wheat bran, and manure in equal parts for composting, which was both labor-saving, quick to decompose, and had a long-lasting effect.

　　黎城突击三大增产
  　雨后积肥十五万驮
    【本报黎城讯】二十八日全县普落透雨，各村英雄党员，响应党委的号召，开展了撒菜、锄苗、积肥三大增产运动。在短短十天时间，全县共补种晚作物一三九三○亩（包括白地窟窿地玉茭地麦地），撤荞麦二九八○亩，油菜七八二○亩，其收秋菜三一○○亩，六十日黄玉茭三十亩，将全县的白地窟窿地全部都消灭，还集体开荒撒菜五○○亩。金皇后二四二二九亩普遍锄过了二锄，上了一次追肥，五六区有五千亩已经锄过了三次。土玉茭四三九九七亩普遍锄过了一次，有三分之二锄过二次，上过追肥。棉花二万亩已锄过了三次，进行了脱裤打杈。车元村棉花已锄过了七次，八一一谷五九○○亩已锄了二次。二区台北基点还进行了一次奶肥。全县要争取玉茭锄三次，谷锄二次，棉花普锄四次（这个数有雨前进行的）。雨后全县共积肥十五万驮，给今年扩大麦田打下了有力的基础。运动中有如下三个特点：
    一、英雄党员带头，组织男女一切劳力突击撒菜锄苗积肥运动。暴家脚英雄霍仓则，在翻身农民大会上，访他在四三年全家五口人撒了二亩油菜，除一冬天吃了春天还换了五大斗米，渡过了严重的灾荒。二区段家庄支部号召“糠菜渡荒能顶粮，每人半亩油菜渡灾荒”，在党员的带头下，开展了每人撒半亩菜运动，三天即完成。王家庄劳动英雄董桃气在全村积极分子会上提出口号是“谷锄三次十谷九米”，在他的领导下，研究出雨后锄苗三大好处：（一）半年没有下雨今秋一定出小草，再锄一次草结不下籽，明春地干净。（二）趁现在下雨锄，又养垧又养苗。（三）多锄秋天能多出粮。在老英雄推动下全区普遍锄完了二锄，有已进行三锄。三区英雄王聚才提出口号是“伏天锄破皮，顶住秋天犁一犁”，现在正是伏天要多锄多上肥，争取每亩秋后多打五升粮。北流妇女的口号是“妇女组织起来赛过男子汉”，在英雄刘仲景、王小平等组织领导下，全村青壮年妇女，停止纺织集体开荒撒菜，消灭窟窿地。柏峪雨刚停止即提出“趁水好沤肥”的口号，全村劳力一下午沤肥二千驮。全县男女劳力都卷入到这个三大增产运动中。
    二、全县干部群众要求多打粮食思想是非常明确的，领导上抓住了这个广大群众的思想要求，全县普遍召开贫雇会，认识目前灾荒情况，发动大量种菜，结合时事教育，克服了少数麻痹思想。后狄峪英雄李恩魁说：“就捉住根苗儿，雨也下晚啦，往年六月六日谷莠，今年可不行，玉茭长腰来高倒莠出脑缨儿来啦，今年灾荒是定啦，怎样好收也只有半个年景”。风子驼王爱英说：“今年粮食不是光够自己吃就行啦，我们还得叫咱军队不缺粮吃才行，人是铁饭是钢，没有粮食怎样能打老蒋，咱还得好好生产”。糠菜渡荒能顶粮，赶种荞麦和油菜等渡灾荒，成为全县一致行动的口号，糊涂思想在广大运动中消逝了。
    三、解决了工资、种籽问题，贯澈了技术。降低工资是深耕细作的主要关键，在今春各村的工资一般都高，每工都在六斤小米以上，有的还有十二斤。在锄苗时，灾情又较严重，谁家也嫌工资高出不起米，有劳力户也除了自己劳力算帐，锄一亩地得出几斤米，没有劳力户更不想锄了。在锄苗中，结合整顿互助降低了工资。二区劳动英雄高汉曾，在整顿互助中，引导翻身农民具体算帐，下种时期一个翻身农民出了九大斗工资米，一个地主得了一石四斗，明确了阶级观点，每工降低到四斤，并确定了今后主要是工变工，锄苗时欠下的米，出不起工资秋天还。现全县工资都明确了是以工变工，都降低到四五斤以下。合作社对补种晚作物的种籽全部解决，城内合作社派专人到武乡买荞麦种籽四石，买油菜一百五十斤，照原价出卖给群众。因此全县补种了一万四千亩晚作物，种籽毫没感到困难。
    在整个突击运动中，贯澈了技术问题。如二区台北基点研究出锄苗上追肥技术，麻饼奶谷是按垄撒，一亩五个饼，接着再去锄一次，肥很快即起了作用。奶玉茭将玉茭四周扒成饼熬形地池，把肥放里，用土盖住，这样玉茭容易吸收肥料；玉茭苗小时上肥近些，大了上肥远些。锄玉茭时土堆大些，保苗不怕大雨扑倒又养垧。西水洋靳玉良推广了保棉技术，棉花要多锄四次至六次，按时打顶脱裤。停河铺在雨中研究了积肥技术，沤肥时用道土、麦糠、圈肥三大混合的办法，又省工又快烂劲又大。（联合办公室王维屏执笔）
