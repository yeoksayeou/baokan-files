    Voluntary Combination Develops Mutual Aid
    Yuan Dynasty Universally Weeded and Accumulated Fertilizer
    [This newspaper, Jinnan, 6th dispatch] Yuan Dynasty universally engaged in mutual aid for weeding and fertilizer accumulation. In Liu Cheng Village, District One, eight mutual aid groups were organized, and the more than two hectares of autumn seedlings were weeded twice. The Liu Qinggao group started at 5 a.m. and each person weeded one mu of land, which was faster than in the past. The Liang Xiufeng group weeded during the day and carried water to make fertilizer at night. Liu Fengjing, who was over sixty years old, cut grass and carried water to make fertilizer during the lunch break. In × Village, 110 mutual aid groups had largely weeded the spring seedlings three times, newly built 70 manure pits, and reclaimed 80 mu of barren land. In Bei Lizhuang, 118 households joined together in mutual aid and had weeded the spring seedlings three times, preparing to weed them four times. The group leaders also decided to inspect each other after weeding. Ren Shouchun, nicknamed "Idle Man," and Zhang Lansheng, nicknamed "Sleepyhead," were also motivated to participate. After the "Summer Production Competition" was launched in District Four, Dongxi Quan Village immediately built 96 manure pits. In Bei Shichong, thirteen mutual aid groups weeded 493 mu of seedlings in two days, saving 23 workdays. In Ren Village, 70-year-old × Xiangli took the lead in organizing an agricultural and sideline mutual aid group. He always woke everyone up before dawn and always carried a manure basket when going to the fields. In ten days, his group weeded 214 mu of land, and their oil mill distributed 100 jin of rapeseed cake to each person, which was all applied to the fields. In Shalu, within ten days, male mutual aid groups weeded more than 3,600 mu of seedlings, female groups weeded more than 420 mu, and children's groups and sister groups weeded 54 mu and reclaimed 21 mu of wasteland. In Chen Daoxian Village, eight mutual aid groups weeded 655 mu of seedlings in eight days, with each person weeding four fen more per half-day than before mutual aid. They also reclaimed 17.5 mu of wasteland, built 16 pigsties, and 22 people took time to sell sweet potato seedlings, earning 300,000 yuan. In Zhong Liu Village, eleven mutual aid groups completed weeding 540 mu of autumn seedlings twice in three days. In Yang Village, four mutual aid groups are preparing to raise one pig per household and accumulate a large amount of fertilizer, guaranteeing that all the land will be weeded five times.
    The key to the development of the weeding and fertilizer accumulation campaign in this county is that, first, village cadres and meritorious workers take the lead in demonstrating, and the campaign to establish merit is deeply developed among village cadres and the masses. Second, mobilization is thorough, and the idea of "getting rich" is established among the masses. Third, the development of mutual aid is based on the voluntary participation of the masses, and everything is decided by the masses.
    [This newspaper, Jinnan, 6th dispatch] Five labor heroes in Yaocheng Guzhen, Qiu County, took the lead in accumulating fertilizer, striving to increase production by one dou of grain per mu. The Zhouhua Brigade first carefully managed three pigsties, producing a large cart of manure every three days. The Wang Xiuwen group cut six earth carts of small grass sprouts and picked five loads of locust flowers every day, producing a large cart of fertilizer. Liu Qingxian swept the streets and picked up watermelon rinds during market days, accumulating a large cart of fertilizer. The Ding Zichen and Wang Aichen groups did not forget to accumulate fertilizer while reclaiming wasteland, picking up 650 jin of hair roots in four half-days, which were all composted into manure.
    [This newspaper, Jinnan, 5th dispatch] Nanliu Village in Qiu County designated the sixth lunar month as "Pig Raising and Fertilizer Accumulation Month." Each mutual aid group has formulated a production increase plan based on the original production plan. The Yuan Zhaolin group, a labor hero, first proposed this task, and the whole village responded enthusiastically. The Li Xuekui group strives to increase the grain yield from forty jin per mu to sixty jin (due to sandy soil), for which they need to add 18 carts of fertilizer. In less than two days, the whole village has added fifteen new pigs and accumulated 315 large carts of fertilizer. Spring seedlings are now being top-dressed.

    【本报冀南六日电】元朝普遍互助锄苗积肥。一区刘成村组织了八个互助组，两顷多秋苗锄完二遍。刘清皋组，起五更每人锄了一亩地后，才到过去上晌的时候。梁秀丰组白天锄地，晚上担水造肥。六十多岁的刘凤敬，歇晌时割草担水造肥。×村一百一十个互助组，春苗大部锄过三遍，新开粪坑七十个，开熟荒八十亩。北李庄一百十八户互助起来，春苗已锄三遍，准备锄够四遍，各组长并决定锄完后互相检查。外号叫个“闲人”的任寿春、叫个“睡虫”的张兰生，也都被带起来了。四区各村自掀起“夏季生产竞赛”后，东西劝庄立即造粪坑九十六个；北石冲十三个互助组，两天锄苗四百九十三亩，省工廿三个；任村七十岁的×祥礼，带头组织一个农副业互助组，每天天不明他便叫晌，往地里去时他总捎着粪筐，十天内他组锄地二百十四亩，他们的油坊每人分菜子饼一百斤，都上到了地里。属沙路十天内，男互助组锄苗三千六百余亩，妇女组锄苗四百二十余亩，儿童、姐妹团锄地五十四亩、开荒二十一亩。陈道仙村八个互助组，八天锄苗六百五十五亩，每人一晌比不互助时多锄四分，另开荒十七亩半、造猪圈十六个，二十二人抽空贩卖红薯秧子，获利三十万元。中刘村十一个互助组突击三天，五百四十亩秋苗锄完二遍。杨村四个互助组，每户准备喂一口猪，大量积肥，所有的地保证锄五遍。
    该县锄苗、积肥运动之开展，第一是村干、功臣带头示范，以及立功运动在村干群众中深入开展；第二是动员深入，在群众中树立了“发家致富”的思想；第三发展互助根据群众自愿，一切皆由群众决定。
