　　【Bo'ai News】In order to thoroughly eliminate feudalism and uproot the causes of suffering for a complete transformation, the peasants of the entire county held a large-scale meeting from the 4th to the 7th of this month, with a total of 15,000 participants. Four days before, the news of the meeting spread to the villages, and the peasants cheered, "We are going to have a meeting of Chairman Mao's family!" The five streets in the city originally planned to send 180 people, but after everyone volunteered, the number reached 256. An old woman found a village cadre and questioned him: "Aren't I from Chairman Mao's family? Why didn't you call me to participate!?" During the meeting, peasants from various villages continued to increase. An old woman selling hawthorns at the meeting heard everyone telling of their suffering. She put her basket aside and ran to the front to tell of her own suffering. The meeting was conducted by district. First, people's heroes in the movement to turn things over were elected to summarize the previous stage of experience. The people's heroes took the lead in recounting their suffering, leading to a widespread recounting of suffering, finding the roots of poverty, and "dividing the family" (delineating class boundaries). Each village formulated thorough measures to eliminate feudalism, challenged each other, and proposed a competition to turn things over. The masses were allowed to organize the presidium to lead, and the leadership boldly let go, only using the method of "adding oil to the lamp" to guide. The masses became masters of their own affairs in the meeting, shouting, "The peasants are in power, and their word is law!" The women also shouted boldly, "The peasants are in power, and women account for half!" After everyone recounted their suffering, dug up the roots of poverty, and "divided the family," the masses saw clearly who was from Chiang Kai-shek's family. While the meeting was going on, militia members were sent back to the villages to capture the big and small Chiang Kai-sheks. The first district alone captured 86 households and voluntarily reported the private goods hidden by the landlords. On the 7th, the peasants returned to their villages. On the 8th, smoke rose from every village, and an even fiercer flame was ignited.
