Title: The Weasel Farts as Usual Before Scrambling Away: Wedemeyer's Bluster Cannot Deceive People; Intellectual Circles in Northern Shaanxi Respond with Scorn

Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 27th: Intellectual circles here are responding with scorn to Wedemeyer's statement upon leaving China on the 24th. A summary of discussions within journalistic circles is as follows:

Wedemeyer's departure statement makes three major contributions: First, it demonstrates that the avarice, shamelessness, and corrupt "stubbornness" of Chiang Kai-shek's dictatorial rule are beyond concealment; second, the hatred of the entire Chinese people for this dictatorial rule and American aggression, along with their desire to "annihilate them like eating breakfast," can no longer be obscured before the world; and third, the strength and invincibility of the Liberated Areas' people, especially the People's Liberation Army, are facts that even the U.S. imperialist "envoy," who came to destroy China, finds impossible to distort any further.

This is the concrete reason why Wedemeyer, after completing all the bad deeds of assisting Chiang in the civil war and attacking the people, deliberately refrained from issuing a "Communist suppression proclamation" on the day of his departure. Instead, he hypocritically spouted nonsense about "lasting peace," "the people's welfare," and so on. Wedemeyer equipped Chiang Kai-shek's army, arranged for him to "open trade with Japan" to supplement his civil war finances and arms supplies, and sent advisory groups to prop up his murderous rule. Afterward, he discovered that this still could not solve the fundamental problem. The Chiang government was so "stubborn and incompetent," "sinking into a despicable defeatism," that U.S. imperialism could only rule China through this "incompetent" government, filled with "a multitude of notorious individuals." Wedemeyer was actually caught in a contradiction, so he had to feign "criticism" of the Chiang government's "stubbornness or corruption in responsible positions within the government organization, especially in provincial and county-level organs," reluctantly expressing a demand that Chiang undertake "large-scale reforms." This disgusting pretense of "fairness" is like "a pockmarked face looking in the mirror, pretending to be handsome," but it also shows that even a heinous executioner like Wedemeyer has seen that, under the unanimous condemnation of the people of the world, and even with American domestic public opinion rising up to denounce it, continuing to support a notorious evil government is so difficult that he cannot help but say that it is "truly disheartening." But a son is still a son, and things must be given. However, his own family is in extreme difficulty, on the verge of economic panic and already experiencing some recession. The money must be taken, but it hurts, so he has to scold a few times out of frustration. The son is unfilial, and even if he gets slapped twice and given two copper coins and a paper-made sword and spear, the fact remains that the son is still a thoroughly useless spendthrift. That is why the thunder is loud but the rain is small. When Wedemeyer first arrived, a gang of foxes and dogs in Nanjing were indeed "excited" for a while. However, before long, in just a month, "despicable defeatism" soared into the sky, and even Wedemeyer himself, as a member of the "disheartened" group, could only say, as he was leaving, that "military force itself will not eliminate Communism." Thus, under the vigorous patriotic self-defense war atmosphere of the Chinese people, he had to slink away with his tail between his legs.

The grand comedy of the imperial commissioner has ended like this, and the Kuomintang's Central Daily News editorial could only weakly lament "do our best." However, when a weasel runs away, it always farts as usual. What Wedemeyer babbled about "peace" upon leaving is not merely intended to shift the responsibility for the civil war to the CCP. This trick is one that Marshall once considered genius, but turned into a clumsy failure. Wedemeyer is using this outdated trick to bluster, but it cannot deceive anyone. Wedemeyer has indeed rolled away with a gloomy face, but the fact remains that he gave Chiang Kai-shek equipment for several divisions. It is also very likely that after returning to Washington, he will use the excuse that Chiang is about to collapse to urge increased aid to Chiang and accelerate loans. It is also an inevitable fact that Chiang will collect all the scrap metal he can find to struggle. We understand the likes of Wedemeyer. He will certainly not run back to America and cry bitterly, then crawl into bed and go to sleep. He understands that this son is useless, but precisely because of this, the American imperialist "father" will take advantage of this son's pre-death throes to support him as much as possible and simply let him run amok. Chiang Kai-shek said, "It's over whether we fight to the end or not, but it's better to fight to the end than to have it over without fighting to the end." In short, "it's over" is certain, but there is no doubt that American imperialism will definitely support Chiang in "fighting to the end." The old folks in the Liberated Areas are very clear about this, so the determination of the entire Liberated Areas and the entire Chinese people is extremely clear.

"Lasting peace" will only have practical significance after the corrupt and "stubborn" rule of Chiang Kai-shek is completely ended and the forces of American imperialism are completely driven out of China. The various battlefields of the national patriotic self-defense war, and the various popular actions behind the enemy lines in the Chiang-controlled areas, will have a flurry of good news to answer Wedemeyer's nonsense!

### 黄鼠狼滚蛋前循例放一通臭屁　魏德迈招摇骗不了人  陕北舆论界咸以冷笑置之

　　黄鼠狼滚蛋前循例放一通臭屁
  　魏德迈招摇骗不了人
    陕北舆论界咸以冷笑置之
    【新华社陕北二十七日电】此间舆论界咸以冷笑态度对待魏德迈二十四日离华声明。兹综合新闻界各方面谈论如下：
    魏德迈离华声明最大的贡献，是说明了三件大事。是即第一，蒋介石独裁统治的贪污无耻和腐败“顸”，已经无可掩饰；第二，全中国人民对这独夫统治与美国侵略的憎恨与其“灭此朝食”的要求，已无从在全世界之前加以抹煞；而第三，解放区人民，尤其是人民解放军的强大不可战胜的这一事实，就连为灭亡中国而来的美帝国主义“特使”，也感到无法再加歪曲了。
    这就是魏德迈把助蒋内战进攻人民的坏事件件做完，而在离华那天故意不发表“剿共檄”式的声明，却反面满口胡什么“永久和平”，“人民福利”等等鬼话的具体原因。魏德迈一面替蒋介石装备军队，给他布置“开放对日贸易”来补充内战财政与军火的困难，派顾问团来支撑他的杀人统治；之后，发觉这还不能解决根本问题。蒋政府既如此“顸无能”，“陷入可鄙的失败主义”，而美国帝国主义目前仍只能通过这“既无能”而又充满“声名狼籍的人士之众多”的蒋政府来统治中国。魏德迈实际上陷入矛盾，于是就不得不一面装模作样，“批评批评”蒋政府的“政府组织内，尤其省县机关内担任负责职位之顸或贪污”，勉强表示要求蒋贼“大规模改革”。这种故作“公正”状的恶心相，固是“麻子对看镜，瞎装小白脸”，却也说明了象魏德迈这样穷凶恶极的刽子手，也看到了在全世界人民一致指斥，与甚至美国国内舆论都群起申斥的状态之下，继续支持臭名昭彰的恶政府，已是如何的困难，以至不能不“言之诚属令人丧气”的了。但是儿子终是儿子，东西是要给点的，可是自己家当已万分困难，到处都快要经济恐慌和已经有些不景气；钱是要拿的，心是疼的，一时烦闷因而又得骂两句。儿子是会撒娇的，可能满地打滚起来，于是迫得又骂重了一些。然而骂了之后，又怎么办呢？儿子是不肖的，就算再打两记响耳光，再给他两个铜板与一根纸糊刀枪，结果儿子仍是个澈头澈尾没出息的败家子则是事实。正因如此，雷声大，雨点小，魏德迈初到时，南京一群狐群狗党确会热烘烘的“兴奋”了一阵；然而曾几何时，只那么一个月，“可鄙的失败主义”竟冲了天，就连这魏德迈自己也象“丧气”集团中的一员，临走时唯一能说的，就只剩了一句“军事力量本身，将不能消灭共产党主义”了。于是在中国人民蓬勃的爱国自卫战争气氛下，只好夹着尾巴溜掉。
    巡按使的大喜剧就这么下场，国民党中央日报社论便只好有声无力的哀鸣“尽其在我”了。然而，黄鼠狼溜走时，循例总得放一个屁，魏德迈临走时，胡的什么“和平”，目的决不仅限于将内战责任推给中共。这伎俩是马歇尔曾自命天才，而弄巧反成拙的大失败，魏德迈把这过了时的老套拿来招摇，更是欺骗不了任何人。魏德迈固然满脸晦气的滚蛋了，但他给了蒋介石以若干个师装备是事实。可能回到华盛顿以后，借口蒋贼快会垮台而催促加重援蒋，加速贷款之类也极有可能；而蒋贼将搜集一切破铜烂铁来挣扎一番，也是必然的事实。我们是明白魏德迈之流的，他决不会跑回美国就大哭一场，从此钻进被窝中睡觉去。他明白这儿子没出息，但正因为如此，洋爸爸的美帝国主义就更会趁这儿子未寿终正寝之前，尽量支持他索性撒泼一顿。蒋介石说过的，“打完亦完，不打完仍完，宁可打完了完，不可打不完亦完”。总而言之，“完”是一定的，但是美帝国主义对蒋贼必是“宁可打完了完”也属无可置疑。解放区老百性对这认识至为清楚，因此全解放区、全中国人民的决心就至为明确。
    “永久的和平”只有在蒋介石贪污而“顸”的统治彻底结束和美帝国主义势力彻底驱逐中国以后，才有现实意义。全国人民爱国自卫战争各个战场，蒋管区后方的各方面民众行动，将会有雪花片般的捷报，来回答魏德迈的满纸荒唐言！
