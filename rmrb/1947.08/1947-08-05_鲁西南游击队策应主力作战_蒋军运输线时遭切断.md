    [Report from this newspaper's Hebei-Shandong-Henan Bureau on the 2nd] After General Liu Bocheng's army went south, the guerrilla forces, armed work teams, mine explosion teams, and militia behind enemy lines in Huxi actively took action, appearing and disappearing unpredictably on the highways of Jinxiang, Shanxian, Dangshan, and Shanxian-Yucheng, attacking enemy transport and cutting off enemy supplies. At noon on July 13th, the enemy's 58th Division moved from Dangshan along the highway towards Shanxian. When the tail of the enemy's column reached a certain place, six guerrillas jumped out of the sorghum fields beside the road, shouting loudly, and intercepted eight enemies (including one deputy regimental commander) and a radio station, all of whom were immediately captured. On the 12th, eight guerrillas, divided into two groups, ambushed in the sorghum fields on both sides of the Shanxian-Yucheng highway. At noon, two enemy transport vehicles were intercepted by us, and ten enemies, thousands of kilograms of rice and flour, and three thousand kilograms of gasoline were all captured. The activities of the armed work team in Fanggui District, Shanxian County, were even more impressive. In seven days, they captured a total of 120 enemy soldiers and seized more than ten guns on the Jinxiang-Shanxian highway. On the afternoon of the 14th, a certain large detachment in Huxi ambushed the enemy at Thirty Li Pu. After fierce fighting for over an hour, they routed a part of the 58th Division, capturing 20 enemy soldiers and seizing two light machine guns, one small cannon, and 20 rifles. The militia on the Jinxiang-Shanxian highway captured 25 enemy stragglers in five days from July 10th to 15th. On July 14th, three enemies wiring electricity from Dangshan to Shanxian stepped on a landmine, killing and wounding two. On the same day, when the enemy departed from Shanxian to Jinxiang, twenty li from the city, five landmines exploded. The enemies who triggered the mines were blown to pieces, and the remaining enemies were stunned and dared not move forward.
    [Report from this newspaper's Hebei-Shandong-Henan Bureau on the 2nd] In the eight months of continuous mopping-up and suppression by the enemy (from October of last year to the end of May this year), the Qihe militia implemented the policy of "holding a gun in one hand and distributing land in the other," fighting the enemy more than 200 times, supporting the peasants' land reform, and achieving remarkable results. Since Chiang Kai-shek's bandits attacked southwestern Shandong, the county's militia have victoriously persisted in guerrilla warfare behind enemy lines, changing from nighttime activities to strike at bad elements to daytime attacks, ambushes, and pursuits of the enemy, making it impossible for small groups of local bandits to dare to boldly harass. Later, they went on to fight the enemy's regular army, proactively attacking traffic on the highways and launching an explosion campaign. In particular, the militia team in the Fourth District has continuously ambushed cars on the Dingtao-Cao County highway in the past six months, once making the Dingtao-Cao County road deserted, and has been commended twice by the District Committee.

    鲁西南游击队策应主力作战
    蒋军运输线时遭切断
    【本报冀鲁豫二日电】刘伯承将军大军南下后，湖西敌后的游击队、武工队、地雷爆炸队、民兵，积极行动起来，在金（乡）、单（县）、砀（山）单、单虞（城）这几条公路上，神出鬼没，袭击敌人运输，切断敌之供应。七月十三日正午，敌五十八师由砀山沿公路往单县蠢动，当敌人队尾走到某处，路旁高粱地里跳出六个游击队员，大喊一声，截住八个敌人（内副团长一人）及电台一部，并当即被俘获。十二日，八个游击队员，分成两个小组，在单虞公路两侧高粱地里埋伏，正午敌辎重车两辆被我截击，十个敌人，几千斤大米洋面，三千斤汽油，都被俘获。单县芳桂区的武工队活动，更为惊人，他们七天中，在金单公路上共俘敌百二十人，缴枪十余支。湖西某大队于十四日下午在三十里铺伏击敌人，激战一小时许，将五十八师一部击溃，俘敌二十人，缴轻机枪二挺，小炮一门，步枪二十支。在金单公路上的民兵，在七月十日至十五日五天中，捉敌溃兵二十五名。七月十四日，从砀山往单县的三个架电线的敌人，踏中地雷，死伤两人。同日敌人由单县往金乡出发，距城二十里，踏响地雷五个，触雷敌人，被炸得粉身碎骨，剩下的敌人也呆若木鸡，不敢前进。
    【本报冀鲁豫二日电】齐滨民兵在敌人不断扫荡清剿的八个月中（去年十月至今年五月底），贯彻了一手拿枪一手分田方针，与敌作战二百余次，支持了农民土地改革，获得显著成绩。自蒋贼进攻鲁西南以来，该县民兵胜利坚持了敌后游击战争、由黑夜活动打击坏分子，变为白天袭击、伏击、追击敌人，使小股土顽不敢大胆出扰，后来更进而打敌正规军，主动向公路上破击交通，展开爆炸运动。特别是四区民兵队，过去半年中在定曹公路上不断伏击汽车，曾使定曹路断人稀，曾受地委两次表扬。
