Xinhua News Agency, Jin察冀 [Jin-Cha-Ji] 15th dispatch: The South Grand Canal waterway, stretching approximately 800 *li* from Qing County in the north to Linqing in the south, is now clear and unobstructed. The Botou Township Shipping Guild, along with shipping companies and other units, under the strong assistance of the Central Hebei Democratic Government, has been working diligently and has now begun navigation. The company currently owns more than 20 large wooden boats. Staging posts have been established in important cities and towns along the canal, such as Cang County, Dongguang, and Chengwu and De County in Shandong. The opening of the South Grand Canal contributes significantly to the exchange of materials between the Central Hebei, Southern Hebei, and Bohai liberated areas.
