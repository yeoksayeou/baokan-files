Qiu County, Taozhai Village
Precise Calculation
Organized Manure Collection
[This dispatch from Jinnan, Hebei Province] After weeding the seedlings three times, preparations are underway for accumulating manure to plant wheat. After the Wang Yichen mutual aid team in Taozhai, Second District, Qiu County, finished weeding their fields three times, the entire team held a meeting to discuss accumulating manure in preparation for planting wheat. The whole team, consisting of thirteen people, planned to plant a total of 156 mu of wheat. Calculated at half a cart of manure per mu, they needed 88 large carts of manure. After this calculation, some said, "We need to buy rapeseed cake." Others said, "We should soak green grass shoots in the manure pit to make fertilizer water." Still others said, "Let's build a pigsty, where the pigs will trample the ground every day. Every three or four days, we'll spread grass, ash, soil, and other dirt, and sprinkle water on it every day." Everyone said, "This way, in a little over a month, we can make a pit of manure that's both dark and strong, enough to make five large carts. The whole team already has eight pits, which can accumulate forty large carts of manure. If we dig a few more pits and supplement with ash and soil manure from home, as well as buying rapeseed cake, it won't be a problem." Everyone unanimously decided to do it this way, and their enthusiasm was high. They also discussed plowing the wheat fields earlier to let them dry in the sun. They also decided to plow the wheat fields three times before and after the hot weather, and to hoe the seedling fields once or twice. With the plans set, everyone said with full confidence, "Just wait and see the good wheat from our team next year!"

    精确计算
    组织积肥
    【本报冀南一日电】锄苗三遍，积肥准备种麦。邱县二区桃寨王毅臣互助组三遍地锄完，全组开会讨论积肥准备种麦。全组十三人，共计划种麦一百五十六亩，每亩按半车粪计，需粪八十八大车，除现有十八车外，尚缺粪七十车，大家这样一计算，有的说：“要买菜籽饼”。有的说：“在粪坑里沤青草芽粪水”。有的说：“打猪圈，猪天天踏，三、四天铺一次草、灰、土等脏物，每天泼水”。大家说：“这样有一个多月可将一坑粪，沤的又黑又壮，可沤五大车。全组现已有八个坑，即能积肥四十大车，再掘几个坑，另由家里灰土粪，及买菜子饼补充，就不成问题了，大家一致决议这样办劲头很大。又讨论早些犁麦地晒起来，又决议留麦地，伏天前后犁三遍，苗子地可锄一遍至二遍，计划好了，大家带着十足信心的说：“明年看咱组的好麦子吧”。
