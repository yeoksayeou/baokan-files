　　Zheng Village Actively Accumulates Fertilizer
　　Half of Land Planted with Wheat
　　[Our Newspaper, Licheng News] In order to increase production to support the front lines and ensure sufficient grain for both the front and the rear, and to completely eliminate Chiang Kai-shek, Zheng Village in the Fourth District, in addition to carefully cultivating and fertilizing various autumn seedlings this year to strive for an increase of one big dou per mu, also proposed "Plant what you reap, plant more and reap more." The entire village formulated a plan to increase the area planted with wheat by 800 mu in addition to the 1,020 mu of regular wheat land, with wheat planting accounting for one-half of all land. They also proposed applying 35 loads of fertilizer per mu. To prepare early and accumulate more fertilizer, on the morning of August 14th (after rain), they convened more than 30 people from the hero cadre technical committee to study methods for increasing fertilizer: more bedding for livestock pens. The village has 83 head of livestock. After reviewing the past, it was found that the amount of soil used for bedding was very small, and some did not use soil at all. It was decided that in the future, small livestock should be bedded with half a load per day, and large livestock with one load per day, with each donkey averaging 20 loads of fertilizer (previously only 10 loads). At the same time, they would cut artemisia, scrape wasteland, and sweep road soil. After the research, that evening, hero activists launched discussions in teams and mobilized people. The next day, activists took the lead and started working, with men and women competing to accumulate fertilizer. According to statistics for the 15th, 78 men scraped 2,570 loads of wasteland fertilizer and accumulated 2,330 loads of wheat bran and other fertilizer. Activist Yang Jiangping scraped 300 dan of wasteland in one day, and women's salvation committee member Yang Yuzhen and 55 other women cut 2,160 jin of artemisia in one day (equivalent to 216 loads of fertilizer) and scraped 115 loads of road soil, accumulating a total of 5,525 loads. Bedding for livestock pens has been fully implemented. (Xiang Qin, Bu Dai, Hua Rong)
　　[Our Newspaper, Xingtai News] After two rectifications of mutual aid, the masses in Pangma Village, Second District, realized that their own labor is the key to prosperity. They boldly added livestock and farm tools and actively worked for prosperity. During the drought resistance period from May to June, the village's 220 households added 43 head of livestock, dug two new wells, and made 380 waterwheel buckets. In addition to preserving 458 mu of autumn seedlings, they also reclaimed 110 mu of wasteland, rushed to plant and replant 2,100 mu of late seedlings, planted 450 mu of buckwheat, and planted 134 mu of vegetables. Various sideline productions are being set up, including: the head of the armed committee opening a Zhang Luo shop, earning 100,000 yuan, and the whole group adding another good donkey; Liu Mengxian's group opening a shoe shop, etc., earning more profits. It is estimated that the entire village will produce 1.4 million yuan more in materials than in previous years. Their slogan is: "Guarantee food and clothing, and achieve 'cultivate three, surplus one'." (Yu Min)
