　　Soviet Proposal Rejected by the US
  　US Ambition to Monopolize Japan Exposed

    Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 17th - According to the US News Service in Washington: The Soviet Union's proposal that the drafting of the peace treaty with Japan should be agreed upon by the four powers has been unreasonably rejected by the United States. The US note was delivered to the Soviet Deputy Minister in Success Lake on the 14th, and the US State Department announced it on the 15th. The note stubbornly insisted on unilaterally convening a meeting of the eleven nations of the Far Eastern Commission to formulate the principles of the peace treaty with Japan. The US imperialist ambition to monopolize Japan has been thoroughly exposed by this.
