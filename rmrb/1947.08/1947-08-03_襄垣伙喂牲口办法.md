Xiangyuan County has a relatively common practice of communal livestock feeding. Based on materials from four villages, there are several different feeding methods: (1) In Xidi Village, Fourth District, Wu Rongze and two other families communally feed one cow. The cost of buying the cow was divided into ten shares. The fodder for feeding the livestock, the livestock equipment, and the expenses for supporting labor and transportation are all shared equally by the ten shares. Wu Rongze is responsible for feeding the livestock, and his compensation is the manure. Rongze unifies the use of the livestock, and whoever he works for pays him wages. In the event of public service duties such as supporting labor and transportation, the ten shares cover his wages. Plowing and other living expenses are shared according to the ten shares; those who use more contribute grain, and those who use less receive items. All income from transportation and the sale of the cow are divided equally among the ten shares. Accounts are settled monthly. Because all aspects are very reasonable, the livestock are getting better and better, and there are no disagreements among the families. (2) Zhou Tianzhen's mutual aid group in Baodi Village obtained a large cow during the land reform last year. Eight families each own one share. One person is dedicated to feeding and using the cow. The feeder receives the manure. The method of use: according to the market price for plowing, four mu of land equals one "xiang" (a unit of work), and one "xiang" earns one work point. Hauling coal for one day is the same as plowing one "xiang" of land, earning the same amount of money. After deducting expenses for fodder, profits are distributed seasonally according to shares. (3) Wang Baocun's mutual aid group in Guozhuang Village bought a mule together with seven households, totaling ten shares. A designated person feeds the mule and receives the manure. The feeder is responsible for public service duties such as supporting labor and transporting grain. All profits from transportation and other sideline occupations during the slack season also belong to the feeder. The fodder is shared equally, and the grass is consumed by whoever has it, regardless of the amount. Method of cultivation: five sheng of rice per mu for plowing, seven households each receive two shi of rice vouchers, whoever plows the land pays the rice vouchers. When settling accounts in the future, the rice obtained from the sale of plowing services will be distributed according to the ten shares, and then the resulting surplus or deficit will be calculated based on the amount of rice each household should have paid. (4) Guo Xinggui's mutual aid group in Guozhuang Village bought a donkey together with five households. A designated person feeds the donkey and receives the manure. Public service duties and income from transportation and other sideline occupations also belong entirely to the feeder. The fodder is shared equally among the five households. Plowing is carried out equally by the five households, with completion as the standard. Although the land of each household varies, the difference is not large. Everyone is responsible for the profits and losses of the livestock. Based on the above materials, research has found that in order to make communal livestock feeding solid and sustainable, the following five conditions must be met: (1) The number of shares must be fixed, and expenses must be shared equally (fodder, farm implements, supporting labor, and all other expenses are borne by everyone). In Guozhuang, the support labor is the responsibility of the feeder, and excessive support labor will affect consolidation. (2) A designated person should feed the livestock, and the feeder should be given a certain amount of compensation. In all four methods above, the feeder receives the manure. (3) A designated person should use the livestock, and the person using the livestock should be paid the wages stipulated by the mutual aid group. (4) Rights should be enjoyed according to shares, and households should be allowed to determine their own number of cultivation times. Those who use more contribute items, and those who use less receive items. In Guo Xinggui's group in Guozhuang, cultivation is carried out on an average per household basis. Although the land of each household does not vary greatly, average cultivation will affect deep plowing and meticulous cultivation. Other income from selling plowing services and transportation should also be divided equally according to shares. The method of giving the income from transportation and other activities to the feeder in Guozhuang, if the profits from transportation are too high, will arouse jealousy from others. (5) Accounts should be settled regularly and cleared at once, such as the monthly settlement of accounts in Xidi Village, which everyone is very satisfied with. (Xiangyuan Joint Office Bulletin)

    襄垣伙喂牲口办法
    襄垣全县伙喂牲口的比较普遍，根据四个村材料，有以下几种不同的喂养办法：（一）四区西底村武荣则等三家，伙喂着一头牛，买牛钱是按十股摊的，喂牲口的草料，使用牲口的家具，以及支差义运的开支，都由十股均摊，喂牲口责任归武荣则，报酬是粪归他，由荣则统一使用牲口，给谁家做活谁给他出工资，遇有支差义运等公差，十股给他摊工资。耕地等生活，按十股享受，多用的出粮食，少用的得东西，运输卖牛晌等一切收入，归十股均分，一月一算帐。因为各方面都很合理，所以牲口越喂越好，各家之间也没有意见。（二）堡底周天贞互助组，去年翻身中分得大牛一头，八家八股，一人专门喂养使用，喂牛人得粪，使用办法：按卖牛晌办法，耕地四亩为一晌，一晌得一天工票，拉煤一天和耕一晌地一样，赚的半晌钱，除草料开支外，以季节按股分红。（三）郭庄王保存互助组，七户伙买一头骡，顶十股，专人喂养得粪，支差送粮等公差，由喂养人负责，农闲搞运输所得利润，也全部归喂养人，料是均摊，草是谁有吃谁的，不论多少。耕作办法：一亩地五升米牛晌，七户各领二石米票，给谁耕地谁出米票。将来算帐，将卖牛晌所得米，按十股分红，再根据各户应出牛晌米，算出存欠结果。（四）郭庄郭兴贵互助组，五户伙买一头驴，专人喂养得粪，支差等公役及运输等副业收入也尽归喂养人，草料五户均摊，耕作是五户平均过，以耕完为标准，各户土地虽有不一，但差数不大。牲口赔赚大家负责。根据以上材料，经研究发现，要想使伙喂牲口巩固经常下去，必须具备以以五个条件：（一）肯定股数，用费均摊（草料、农具、支差等一切开支均归大家），郭庄的支差由喂养人负责，支差过多，就会影响巩固。（二）专人喂养，给喂养人一定报酬，以上四种办法都是喂养人得粪。（三）专人使用，使用牲口的人得以互助组规定的工资。（四）按股享受权利，同时允许自定耕作次数，多用者出东西，少用者得东西。郭庄郭兴贵组以户平均耕作，虽各户土地差数不大，但平均耕作就会影响深耕细作。其他卖牛晌搞运输收入，也应按股均分，郭庄运输等收入归喂养人的办法，假如运输等获利太多，就会引起别人眼红。（五）定期算帐，一次一清，如西底村一月一算帐，大家都很满意。（襄垣联合办公室通报）
