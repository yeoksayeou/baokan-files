Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 25th: Prague dispatch: The Second Congress of the Executive Committee of the World Federation of Democratic Youth opened in Prague on the 21st, with 87 committee members attending. The congress adopted the following agenda: Boyson's report on the activities of the Executive Committee and the issue of democratic youth consolidating peace; reports from organizations in China, Britain, the Soviet Union, France, the United States, and Southeast Asian countries; discussion of the needs of working youth worldwide and youth in colonial countries; preparations for the Southeast Asian Colonial and Dependent Countries Youth Congress, etc. The meeting continued on the 22nd, with Soviet representative and Vice Chairman of the Federation, Isanov, pointing out in his report that the success of the International Youth Day Congress and the joining of five million new members to the Federation demonstrated the growing strength of the Democratic Youth League. Chen Jiakang, a representative from our liberated areas and a member of the League's Executive Committee, also spoke at the meeting, condemning the U.S. aid to Chiang's civil war policy, stating: "Due to an unprecedented civil war in history, Chinese youth have not yet achieved peace today and are being forced to shed blood. I dare to guarantee that without American aid and interference, Chiang Kai-shek would not be able to launch this large-scale civil war. The U.S. government demands strategic bases from the Chiang government, controls its administration, and participates in the command of the Kuomintang army. This is to turn China into an American appendage. I hope that American youth will launch a movement to immediately stop American interference in China's internal affairs. On behalf of the democratic youth of China, I demand that the democratic youth of the world expose Chiang Kai-shek's reactionary policies."

Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 26th: Prague dispatch: The Executive Committee of the World Federation of Democratic Youth has been holding meetings for several days. On the 22nd and 23rd, Chairman Pierson's report of the Executive Committee was discussed. Weiner, a U.S. representative and a member of the League's Executive Committee, stated: "American youth have already established unified organizations in New York, Chicago, and other individual cities, and they are also preparing to discuss organizing a national student federation during the National Student Union meeting in September." Weiner condemned the U.S. government's policy of abandoning solidarity with allied countries, interfering in the internal affairs of other countries, supporting reactionaries in Germany, Japan, Spain, Greece, Turkey, and other countries, and using Nazi racial theories to蛊惑 (bewitch, confuse) American youth. The U.S. government is educating young people to believe that the United States is "the most superior country in the world" and that "everyone else should obey the United States." The Greek representative at the meeting denounced the atrocities of the Greek reactionary government supported by U.S. imperialism and reported on the heroic struggle of Greek democratic youth for democracy. The representative from northern Korea praised the democratic reforms in North Korea and vehemently condemned the bloody terror rule implemented by reactionary elements in South Korea, supported by the United States. The Vietnamese representative also spoke at the meeting, exposing the French government's barbaric behavior in Vietnam and its suppression of the people's independence movement.
