Xinhua News Agency, Shandong, 3rd. The Binhai Southern, Donghai, Linyi (Xin County Eastern Linyi), Tancheng and other county local armed forces launched a widespread attack on the Chiang-occupied areas. In the first ten days of July, they recovered more than 150 villages and towns. After the Tancheng area guerrillas captured 30 villages including Caozhuangzi and Xieweizi on the east bank of the Shu River, they advanced to the west bank, directly threatening the important supply lines of Chiang's army from Xin'an Town to Tancheng, and from Linyi to Tancheng. Encouraged by the victory, the people's self-defense confidence has been greatly improved. According to the statistics of Donghai's three districts alone, more than 400 farmers have joined the militia. In conjunction with the political offensive, more than 600 villages and towns in Linmu and Tancheng counties have launched a wave of anti-Chiang revenge, roaring: "Life for a life, extortion for compensation!" After a landlord's "Homecoming Corps" robbed six cattle and kidnapped eight farmers in a village in Tancheng, the masses immediately arrested the family members of the landlord's "Homecoming Corps." The next day, the "Homecoming Corps" had to return all the people and cattle. The masses in various places are now automatically controlling the family members of the "Homecoming Corps," urging them to persuade their pro-Chiang elements to stop doing evil.

Xinhua News Agency, Shandong, 3rd. The Shandong Military Region and the Provincial Government have recently jointly promulgated a new decision on the treatment of stretcher transport teams. In view of the fact that the past adoption of the supply system and the voluntary system could not exert high efficiency, in order to save manpower and financial resources, and adapt to the current socio-economic characteristics and war requirements, except for the front-line civilian labor that is still using the supply system, the rest should be done as much as possible by adopting contracting system, package transportation system, piece-rate system or supply-reward system. The methods are as follows: (1) All the transportation of grain, ammunition and materials from the station and various organs, troops and factories with fixed receiving and sending points, regardless of length, shall in principle adopt a package system or a piece-rate system. (2) The permanent transport team serving at the station shall adopt a piece-rate system or a supply-reward system. (3) All semi-detached production package transport teams with a fixed organizational form to ensure immediate dispatch shall completely adopt a contracting system or a piece-rate system. (4) The package transport teams and short-term civilian husbands who do not break away from production shall completely adopt a piece-rate system or a package transport system. In addition, it is stipulated that local governments and front-line support agencies should uniformly allocate civilian labor, strengthen the work of civilian stations, and organize mass-based restaurants and hotels to ensure food, accommodation and medical care for civilian husbands.

    滨南地方武装作战十天
    攻克村镇百五十处
    【新华社山东三日电】滨海南部东海临沭（新县临沂东部）郯城等县地方武装向蒋占区广泛出击，在七月头十天内即收复村镇一百五十余处。郯城地区游击队于沭河东岸连克曹庄子谢围子以下三十个村庄后，挺进至河西，直接威胁蒋军新安镇至郯城、临沂至郯城等重要补给线。在胜利鼓舞下，各地群众自卫信心大大提高，仅据东海三个区的统计，即有四百余农民参加民兵。临沐、郯城两县已有六百余村镇在结合政治攻势中，掀起了反蒋复仇的浪潮，怒吼：“杀人要偿命，勒索要赔钱！”郯城某庄被地主“还乡团”抢去牛六头，绑去农民八人后，群众即将地主“还乡团”家属逮捕起来，次日，该“还乡团”只得将全部人牛送还。各地群众现并自动管制“还乡团”家属，促使他们劝导其附蒋分子终止作恶。
    【新华社山东三日电】山东军区与省府顷联合颁布关于担架运输队待遇办法的新决定。鉴于过去采用供给制与义务制不能发挥高度效能，如节省人力财力，适应目前社会经济特点及战争要求，除前方民力仍用供给制外，其余尽量采取包工制、包运制、按件计工制或供给提奖制。其办法如下：（一）凡兵站及各机关部队工厂之粮弹物资等运输有一定收发地点者，不论长短夫，原则上一律采用包用制，或按件计工制。（二）在兵站服务之常备运输队，采按件计工制或供给提奖制。（三）凡半脱离生产之包运队有固定组织形式保证随调随到者，则完全采用包工制或按件计工制。（四）一不脱离生产之包运队及短余民夫，则完全采按件计工制或包运制。此外，并规定由各地政府与支援前线机关统一支配民力，加强民站工作，组织群众性的客店饭店、保证民夫食宿及医药等。
