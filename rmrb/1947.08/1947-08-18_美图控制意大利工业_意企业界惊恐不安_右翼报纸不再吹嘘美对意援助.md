Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 14th: Rome dispatch: Italian business circles are panic-stricken about the Marshall Plan. The so-called "Cooperation Committee" of the European Economic Recovery Conference has sent an economic "survey form" to Italy. Based on the completion of this form, under the instigation of the United States and with the consent of Britain and France, they have formulated an industrial plan for Italy, forcing Italy to abandon industries such as steel, papermaking, machinery, motorcycles, and chemicals, and replace them with small-scale shipbuilding, canned goods, and wine production. Italian business circles believe that this industrial plan is a fatal danger to Italy's industry, and they are appealing to the government to prevent foreign interference in Italy's economy. Those right-wing newspapers that once supported the Marshall Plan are now extremely careful and silent, and no longer boast about U.S. "aid" to Italy.
    Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 9th: Washington dispatch: Amidst actively supporting the resurgence of Germany and Japan, U.S. officials have now publicly announced that they will "do everything possible to help and support the reconstruction of Italy." This promise was announced by U.S. Secretary of State Marshall in his telegram to Italian Foreign Minister Sforza on the 3rd, congratulating the Italian Constituent Assembly on approving the Italian peace treaty. The telegram also stated: "Some provisions in the treaty do not conform to the suggestions and wishes of the U.S. government, and Italy can make necessary amendments in the future within the scope of the United Nations or through bilateral agreements with relevant countries." Marshall's above remarks show that the United States will conclude a bilateral treaty with Italy in the future to overturn the peace treaty with Italy that the United States signed. Marshall's congratulatory telegram also revealed: What Marshall is interested in is not the approval of the treaty, but that the approval of the treaty has removed the "obstacles" to Italy's direct relations with other countries and opened the door to abolishing the treaty.

　　美图控制意大利工业
  　意企业界惊恐不安
    右翼报纸不再吹嘘美对意援助
    【新华社陕北十四日电】罗马讯：意大利企业界对马歇尔计划惊恐不安。所谓欧洲经济复兴会议之“合作委员会”，目前曾向意大利送致经济“调查表”，根据这个表的填写，在美国主使与英法同意下，它们已为意大利拟制了一个工业计划，迫使意国放弃钢铁、造纸、机器、摩托、化学等工业，而代之以小型造船、罐头及酒之类的生产。意大利企业界认为这个工业计划对意国工业是一致命的危险，他们并向政府呼吁，防止外国干涉意大利经济。那些曾经替马歇尔计划捧场的右翼报纸，现在也极端小心沉默，不再吹嘘美国对意的“援助”了。
    【新华社陕北九日电】华盛顿讯：在积极扶植德日再起声中，美国官方顷又公开宣布将“尽一切力量帮助与支持意大利之重建”。此项诺言乃美国务卿马歇尔在其三日致电意外长史佛卓祝贺意制宪会议批准意大利和约中所宣布者。贺电中又称：“和约中若干规定与美政府之建议及愿望不符，意大利今后能在联合国范围内或通过有关国家之双方协议，加以必要之修正。”马氏上述言论，显示美国今后将与意大利另订双边条约，以推翻美国签字其上的对意和约。马氏贺电中又透露：马氏所感兴趣者并非该项和约之获得批准，而系由于该约之批准，已撤除了意大利与其他国家直接发生关系之“障碍”，打开了废除是项和约的方便之门。
