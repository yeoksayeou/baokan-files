Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 25th—The "Financial and Economic Cooperation Agreement" signed between the Jiang government and the British Hong Kong government has been postponed at the "request" of the British side. This agreement was originally completed under American pressure. According to the Central News Agency, its main contents are: 1. The Hong Kong side allows Jiang's customs agencies, controlled by the Americans, to come to Hong Kong to carry out "anti-smuggling" operations. 2. The Hong Kong side assists Jiang in suppressing the existence of "legal tender" and US dollar exchange black market rates in Hong Kong. 3. The Hong Kong side agrees that the Hong Kong side's US dollar income (the Jiang government claims that most of this income comes from remittances from overseas Chinese and Chinese export trade) will only be used for Jiang-Hong Kong trade or resold to Jiang's Bank of China after paying the amount required by the Hong Kong side. It can be seen that the role of this agreement is only to facilitate the entry of American forces into Hong Kong and to increase the Jiang government's US dollar foreign exchange income. The full text of the agreement was originally scheduled to be officially announced on the 23rd of this month, but what was announced by both parties on the 23rd was not the full text of the agreement, but a statement of "postponement of publication." Jiang's Central News Agency attributed the reason for the "postponement of publication" to "the British government's sudden announcement at midnight on the 20th of the suspension of the exchange of US dollars for pounds." And claimed: The Hong Kong authorities have requested the postponement of the implementation of the agreement! The British Hong Kong government, in addition to simply announcing the "postponement of publication," did not add any explanation.

　　英抵制美国势力侵入香港
  　蒋港协定遭顿挫
    【新华社陕北二十五日电】蒋政府与香港英政府签订之“经融经济合作协定”，已因英方之“请求”，延缓实行。该协定原系在美国压力下所完成，其内容据中央社披露主要为：一、港方允许美人控制下之蒋记海关机构到港执行“缉私”业务；二、港方协助蒋方取缔港地“法币”与美金外汇黑市比率之存在；三、港方同意港方美金收入（蒋政府称此项收入大部分系来自侨汇及中国出口贸易者）除支付港方所需之数额，所有美金余额只用于蒋港贸易或转售蒋记中国银行。可以看出该协定之作用仅在于便利美国势力之进入香港及用以增加蒋政府美金外汇之收入。协定全文原定本月二十三日正式公布，但二十三日双方所公布者，不是协定全文，而是“延缓公布”之声明。蒋方中央社将“延缓公布”之原因归咎于“英政府二十日午夜突然宣布停止美元与英镑之兑换”。并称：港方当局已要求该协定延缓实施！香港英政府发人除简单宣布“延缓公布”外，未加任何说明。
