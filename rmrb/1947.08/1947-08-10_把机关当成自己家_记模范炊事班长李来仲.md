    Treating the Organization as One's Own Home
    A Profile of Model Cook Squad Leader Li Laizhong
    [This newspaper's Shexian dispatch] Comrade Li Laizhong, the cook squad leader of the County Government, was selected as a first-class work model in the County Government's merit evaluation. He has been working as a cook for more than eight years, treating the organization as his own home. He manages all the furniture and grain in the kitchen. Some comrades leave half a bowl of rice when they finish eating, and he feels it's a waste to throw it away, so he eats the leftover rice himself. He says, "This is our home. If we don't save, how can we have a good life!" In the summer, the weather is very hot, and the large pot that holds two loads of water has to be boiled three or four times a day. Other comrades are afraid of the heat and rest for a while after working. He is afraid that resting will mean burning more coal, so he sits down by the fire to tend to it during breaks. He saves about 30,000 yuan worth of coal each month. Other comrades don't want to feed the pigs raised by the organization because they think it's dirty. Comrade Li Laizhong doesn't mind the dirt or the trouble. Last winter, there was heavy snow, and he cooked food for the pigs in the courtyard. Because of his enthusiasm for raising pigs, the organization's food has been greatly improved. There are many rats in the grain storage on the upper floor of the general affairs section. Every day when they check, more than ten pounds of grain is lost. Li Laizhong inquired everywhere and caught three cats. Others said, "Lao Li, you really have nothing to do," but he didn't mind the trouble of raising the cats, ensuring that the grain was saved. The water carrier in the cook squad is a mute. He is often barefoot and his neck is exposed, and he still doesn't have seasonal clothes to change into in the winter. Comrade Laizhong planned to save money for him, saving the money from his allowance to sew clothes for him. The mute realized that Laizhong was his relative, and he asked him to keep his money for him. This spirit of friendship has been praised by everyone. (Huá Fēng)

    把机关当成自己家
    记模范炊事班长李来仲
    【本报涉县讯】县政府炊事班长李来仲同志，在县府机关评功中，被选为一等工作模范。他任炊事工作已八年多了，把机关当成了自己家，火房里的一切家具粮食，都是靠他来管理，有些同志在吃饭时剩半碗饭，他觉着倒了可惜，把剩下的饭自己吃了。他说：“这就是咱的家，咱要不节省点，怎能过好时光哩！”夏天，天气很热，两担水的大锅，每天得烧三四锅，别的同志怕热，拉一会休息一会，他怕休息会大还得多烧煤，就趁空坐下拉火。每月节省煤约三万多元。机关养的猪，别的同志都不愿喂嫌脏，李来仲同志不嫌脏，也不怕麻烦，去年冬天下大雪，在院里给猪煮饭，由于他热心养猪，使机关伙食得到很好改善。总务股的粮食楼上，老鼠很多，每天检查，粮食总要损失十几斤，李来仲便到处探访，捉来了三只猫，别人说：“老李，你真是没事干啦”，他不怕麻烦养着猫，保让下了粮食。炊事班里挑水夫是个哑巴。常是赤脚、露脖，到冬天还换不上季，来仲同志给他计划节省，省下待遇的钱缝衣服穿。哑吧体会到来仲是他的亲人，有了钱就叫他放起来。这种友爱精神受到大家赞扬。（华峰）
