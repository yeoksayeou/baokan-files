Xinhua News Agency, Northeast, 16th: Harbin's 800,000 people warmly celebrated the second anniversary of the Northeast Liberation "August 15th," a joyous scene unseen in decades. People in various districts proposed completing 150,000 pairs of Victory Army shoes on the 14th. More than 1,300 worker representatives from the city's Federation of Trade Unions, carrying a large number of army support items and consolation funds totaling over 70 million yuan, held a grand army support rally in front of the city government on the 14th. On the 15th, national flags flew throughout the city, and colorful arches were erected on major streets. Nearly a hundred Yangge teams and over ten thousand costumed propaganda team members appeared in the streets and alleys. Colorfully decorated trams and propaganda trucks traveled back and forth on major streets. At 10:00 AM, 150,000 organized mass groups, organizations, troops, and school personnel from Harbin held a celebration meeting at the Daoli Eighth District Park. More than 5,000 liberated farmers from over 20 miles outside the city also came to participate. The meeting opened with the majestic song "Without the Communist Party, There Would Be No China." First, Mayor Liu Chengdong delivered a speech, calling on all citizens to actively support the war and completely eliminate Chiang Kai-shek's invading army. On behalf of the people of Harbin, he paid tribute to the Soviet Red Army for liberating the people of Northeast China. Subsequently, Luo Ronghuan, Deputy Political Commissar of the Northeast Democratic Allied Army, spoke, pointing out that this year's summer offensive laid the foundation for the people of Northeast China to continue expanding their victory, but to win the complete victory of the war and thoroughly eliminate Chiang Kai-shek's invading army, the front-line troops must win more battles, and the people in the rear must work harder in production and actively support the front lines. Gao Chongmin, Vice Chairman of the Northeast Political Committee, combat heroes, and labor models also spoke successively. Finally, the meeting concluded by passing a telegram to Chairman Mao, Commander-in-Chief Zhu, Commander-in-Chief Lin Biao, and all commanders and fighters of the Democratic Allied Army to express their respects, and simultaneously passed a telegram to Marshal Stalin to express the solidarity and enthusiasm of the Chinese and Soviet peoples and the two great nations. A grand parade was held at 12:00 noon, with the procession circling the city, cheered on by over 300,000 people lining the streets, dispersing at 4:00 PM. In the evening, the city was brightly lit, with gongs and drums resounding far and wide, and songs of victory reaching deep into the night.
