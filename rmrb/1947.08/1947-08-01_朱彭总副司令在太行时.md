    When Commander-in-Chief Zhu De and Deputy Commander Peng Dehuai Were in Taihang

    I. Personally Feeding the Wounded Soldiers

    I remember when the headquarters was still in Wuxiang, there was an enemy mopping-up operation. We were the direct unit and acted with the headquarters. We stayed in a small village of more than a dozen households the first day.

    The next day, before dawn, the enemy opened fire in the direction we were heading. The shelling was fierce, and continued until sunrise. However, because our troops bravely resisted in the front, the enemy could not advance quickly. At this time, we were eating, preparing to depart, when a dozen villagers carried several wounded comrades back from the front line. The comrades accompanying the stretchers asked the villagers to get some rice soup to feed the wounded comrades. Commander-in-Chief Zhu walked by, saw that the feeding was not being done properly, and the wounded soldiers were very uncomfortable. He saw that the rice was too hot and scalding to eat. He asked the guards to bring two or three bowls and poured it back and forth several times, and stirred it with a spoon to cool it down. He personally took action, holding the body of a wounded soldier like feeding a child, spoon by spoon, until he finished feeding before he left. After he left, the wounded comrade realized that the person who had just fed him was General Zhu De, the Commander-in-Chief of our Eighth Route Army. He was immediately moved to tears, staring fixedly at the back of the Commander-in-Chief, as if saying: "I will never forget you!"
    II. Let the Little Comrade Ride

    During the anti-mopping-up campaign in May 1942, one comrade fell ill. The situation was very tense at the time, and it was difficult to find livestock or stretchers. Deputy Commander Peng saw that the little comrade was sick, immediately dismounted, and let the little comrade ride. The guard said, "You should ride, I will quickly go to the village to find the little comrade something else." Deputy Commander Peng said, "I can run, let the little comrade ride." The little comrade refused to ride, sincerely expressing to Deputy Commander Peng: "The situation is so tense, it is very important for you to ride, you should ride to command our team to eliminate the enemy; it's okay for me alone, if I run into the enemy, let the enemy kill me, it's nothing, but we must not let you and our team get tired." Deputy Commander Peng was very touched by the little comrade's words, smilingly grasped the little comrade's hand and said, "Don't be afraid, we must live and die together, you are a good little comrade in our revolution, you should still ride." Under Deputy Commander Peng's repeated persuasion, the little comrade reluctantly rode the horse and broke through the enemy's blockade line.

    朱彭总副司令在太行时
    李红
    一、亲手喂伤兵
    记得总部还在武乡住的时候，有一次敌人出动扫荡，我们是直属队，和司令部一块行动，头一天住到一个十多家的小村庄。
    第二天，天不明，敌人就向我们行进的方向打开炮了，打的很猛烈，一直到太阳出来还在打着，但由于我们的部队在前面英勇抗击，遂使敌人不能很快前进。这时，我们正在吃饭，准备出发，十几个老乡从前线抬下来几个彩号。随担架的同志在村上让老乡搞了一些饭汤喂彩号同志。朱总司令从身旁走过，看到喂的不得法，伤员很难受，他看了看是饭太烧，烫的吃不下。他让警卫员拿了两三个碗，来回倒了几次，又用勺子搅凉了，他亲自下手象喂小孩似的抱着一个伤员的身子，一勺一勺的喂，直到喂完他才走。走后，那个伤员同志知道了刚才喂他的那个人就是咱们八路军的总司令朱德将军，立时感动的流出了眼泪，定定的看着总司令的背影，仿佛在说：“我死也忘不了您呀！”
    二，让小同志骑吧
    四二年五月反扫荡中，有一个同志病了。当时情况很紧张，找牲口找担架很困难。彭副总司令看到小同志病了，马上下了马，让小同志骑。警卫员说：“你还是骑上吧，我赶快到村上再给小同志去找”。彭副总司令说：“我能跑，让小同志骑吧，”小同志不肯骑，向彭副总司令天真的表示：“情况这样紧张，你骑非常重要，你骑上好指挥咱们队伍消灭敌人；我一个人怎样也好办，万一碰见敌人，让敌人杀了，也没啥，可千万不能让你和咱队伍受了累。”彭副总司令听了小同志的话很受感动，笑嘻嘻的握住小同志的手说：“不怕，咱们要生死在一起，你是我们革命中的好小同志，还是骑上吧。”在彭副总司令再三的劝骑下，小同志很不好意思的才骑上了马，闯过了敌人的封锁线。
