Xinhua News Agency, Northwest, 1st. - "Strengthen the Main Force and Eliminate Hu Zongnan." Communist Party members in Shaanxi, Gansu, and Ningxia actively take the lead in joining the army. In Yihe District, Suide, influenced by the registration of Party members Tian Juhua and Tian Bingfen, 140 young people had joined the army by July 10th. After the county's youth cadre, He Hande, joined the army, he returned home to persuade his nephews Zhao Guozhu and Liu Shuang'er, as well as ten neighbors, to join the army. These ten people then mobilized a relative or friend each, immediately gathering twenty young people who rushed into the main force. The participation of Party member Li Fu'er from One Township and Party member Liu Mingguang from Two Township promoted the voluntary registration of more than thirty farmers. Eight guerrillas from Zichang County, led by Captain Guo Shantang, also competed to join the regular army.
