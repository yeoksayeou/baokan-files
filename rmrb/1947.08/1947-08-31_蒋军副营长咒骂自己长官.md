(This dispatch was transmitted from Taiyue on the 27th)
　　“On the front lines, the soldiers face life and death; in the tents of the beautiful, there is still singing and dancing.” These are the opening lines of the diary entry from May 16th of Xie Zao-yi, Deputy Battalion Commander of the 2nd Battalion of the 248th Regiment of the 83rd Brigade of the Chiang Army, which was captured in the battle of Pinglu Factory. It reveals the situation of the Chiang army at the front and in the rear, as well as the emotions of the junior officers. According to other captured officers, this Battalion Commander Xie Zao-yi previously did not understand the Liberated Areas at all, and therefore had blindly cursed them. However, in the past year of civil war, many facts at the front and in the rear have led this battalion commander to curse his own superiors. In this day's diary, he continued: "The damned soldiers are desperately fighting at the front, while the big officials and their concubines in the rear are indulging in extravagance and pleasure. Where is there any sign of panic? Alas! At the front and in the rear, the soldiers are poor and the officials are rich... We die for them, can we rest in peace?" Therefore, this poor officer, after seeing the news of the national student strike on the 20th, wrote: "Students can strike, workers can strike, and the most miserable and stupid soldiers, it is said, can also strike against war. Striking against war is a path to survival." When heading north to Shanzhou, this officer was surrounded by fear, and in his diary on May 25th, he wrote: "I heard that the troops are preparing to cross north. There are things to pay attention to in this. Have the superiors carefully studied the situation, and not let us cannon fodder die in vain!" Because of this emotion, this officer attempted to dispel this uneasiness by seeking pleasure with prostitutes; but what was the result? It aroused his curses against the officials again: "On Sanma Road near the Shanzhou South Gate train station, enchanting women in light, brightly colored clothing flaunt their charm here, but they can only satisfy the eyes. Those who truly frequent the brothels are the superiors."

From a place of fear, they arrived in Yuncheng, where they were first ordered by the regiment and battalion commanders to tear down the houses of the common people. In his diary on June 13th, he wrote: "Today we continued to work. The officers and soldiers are already exhausted. From 1:00 PM onwards, except for a few distant thatched houses, more than 700 houses were all flattened (torn down)!" Especially on July 10th, he wrote: "At around 6:00 PM, a messenger rushed in, panting and reporting that the 'communist bandits' (referring to the People's Liberation Army) had arrived near our position. Before he could finish speaking, gunshots suddenly rang out, and there was a moment of panic, with chickens flying, dogs running, and shouts shaking the fields. The battalion commander suspected that the bandits (referring to the PLA) had already stormed into the village, so he first ordered the artillery platoon to block the gate and defend it. I went to ring the bell (telephone) to ask the regiment for support, but the telephone line had been cut, and we could not communicate. Everyone was at a loss and looked at each other." He then wrote: "Suddenly, we heard someone knocking on the door. After a detailed answer, we allowed him to enter. It was a messenger from the 5th company who reported: 'There are more than ten farmers walking in a group, and the sentries mistakenly thought they were communist bandits (referring to the People's Liberation Army) and opened fire.'" "The battalion commander suddenly realized that the phone had not been cut. He then cursed the regiment headquarters for being greedy for life and afraid of death, and for hearing the gunshots and not making contact, and for dismantling the telephone and running away..." They cursed their superiors again.

　　蒋军副营长咒骂自己长官
    【本报太岳二十七日电】“丘八阵前半生死，美人帐下犹歌舞”。这是平陆厂的战斗中所缴获军八三旅二四八团二营副营长解造一的日记中五月十六日开头的两句，道出蒋军前方后方情形与下级军官的情绪。据其他被俘的军官谈：这位解造一营长，平素对解放区是最不了解的一，因此曾经盲目的咒骂过解放区。可是在一年来的内战中，前方后方的许多事实，使这位营长咒骂起自己的官来了。在这天的日记中接着说：“该死的军人在前方拚命，而后方大官姨姐们，花天酒地，那里有半点惊慌之色呢？唉！前方后方，兵富官…………我们为彼而死，能瞑目乎？”因此这位可怜的军官，在二十日看到全国学生罢课的消息后，写道：“学生能罢课，工人能罢工，最苦的最愚笨的军人呢，据说也能罢战，罢战就是生路。”在陕州北调时，这位军官被恐惧所包围，在五月二十五日的日记中写道：“闻部队准备北渡，此中不无注意之处，上级指挥官是否慎重研究了情况，不要使我辈喽罗死于非命！”因为这种情绪，这位军官企图以寻花问柳来消除此种不安心情；可是结果呢？又引起了他咒骂官：“陕州南关车站附近三马路上，神女妖媚，轻衫艳服，在此卖弄风流，但仅仅能偿偿眼福而已，真正于妓院来往不息的，都是长官。”
    从恐惧中开到了运城，首先就奉长、营长命令，大拆老百姓房屋，在六月十三日的日记中写道：“本日仍继续作工，官兵已疲惫不堪，自下午一时起，除较远的数间草房之外，其余七百多间，全数伏地（拆倒了）！”尤其在七月十日写道：“大约六时许，一传令兵大喘进来报告，奸匪（指人民解放军）已到驻地附近，话犹未了，忽闻枪声大起，一时人慌马乱，鸡飞狗奔，喊声震野，营长疑（指解放军）匪已冲入村寨，遂先令炮排堵门固守，我去摇铃（电话）向团部求援，然电线已断，不能通话，个个束手无策，面面相觑。”后又写道：“忽听有人敲门，经过详细回答，允其入内，乃五连之传令兵报告曰：“有农民十余人，结队行，哨兵误为奸匪（指解放军），鸣枪射击。”“营长方恍然大悟，原来电话没有割断，逐骂团部贪生怕死，闻枪声不作联络，便拆电话机逃跑…………。”他们又咒骂起自己的长官来了。
