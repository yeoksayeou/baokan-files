    Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 5th. Moscow Dispatch: Leontiev recently published an article in the Pravda commenting on the drafting of the peace treaty with Japan, stating: "The experience of drafting peace treaties with the five former German allies and the peace treaty with Germany has clearly demonstrated that the work of drafting peace treaties should be successfully completed by a conference of great powers. The drafting of peace treaties with defeated countries must be carried out by countries that have guaranteed victory over the aggressors with their armed forces. This is the only standard for preparing peace treaties, and it is an extremely important standard that has been tested. This principle is embodied in the Cairo Declaration, the Crimean Agreement, and the Potsdam Declaration. The only correct way to draft a peace treaty with Japan is for the United States, the Soviet Union, China, and the United Kingdom, which played a decisive role in defeating Japan, to draft it, and for them to decide by joint resolution in what way to invite that country to participate in the final drafting of the treaty." The article pointed out: The actions of the United States in proposing an eleven-nation conference instead of a foreign ministers' conference have been touted by foreign newspapers since as early as May, when Hoover suggested that "Western powers" conclude separate peace treaties with Germany and Japan. Bevin also advocated at the Margate Labour Party Congress abandoning the Potsdam Agreement's method of drafting peace treaties by the Council of Foreign Ministers and convening an eleven-nation conference. After pointing out that the Soviet Union was the main factor in defeating Japan, the article concluded: "The real motive for attempting to expand the participants in drafting the peace treaty in every way is to manipulate the number of votes. The Soviet Union insists on maintaining the principle of great power unity in peacetime; this principle guarantees that the Allies will reach agreements on issues of peace and security. This principle fully applies to the drafting of the peace treaty with Japan, which must first be considered by the Council of Foreign Ministers of the four countries."

    苏联坚持波茨顿原则
    起草对日和约必先四强协议
    【新华社陕北五日电】莫斯科讯：里昂吉也夫顷在真理报上著文评论起草对日和约称：“起草五个前德国盟邦和约及对德和约的经验，已明确地证明，起草和约工作应由强国会议来顺利完成。对战败国和约的起草，必须由曾以其武装力量保证对侵略者胜利的国家来进行。这是准备和约的唯一标准，而且是经过考验的极其重要的标准。这一原则表现在开罗宣言、克里米亚协议与波茨顿宣言中。起草对日和约的唯一正确方法，就是由曾在击败日本中起决定作用的美苏中英四强来起草，由它们以联合决议来决定以何种方式邀请那一国家参与和约的最后起草。”该文指出：美国提议召开十一国会议而不召开外长会议的行动，外国报纸早在鼓吹：远在五月，胡佛就建议“西方强国”对德日单独缔结和约。贝文在马盖特工党大会上也主张废弃波茨顿协议中关于由外长会议起草和约的方法而召开十一国会议。该文在指出苏联是击败日本的主要因素后结语称：“以一切方式扩大起草和约参加者的企图之真正动机，就是想玩弄票数。苏联坚持在和平时期保持强国一致的原则；这一原则保证盟国在和平与安全问题上获致协议。这一原则完全适用于必须先由四国外长会议考虑的对日和约的起草。”
