    Psychological Warfare and "Opening Blossom" Bullets
    On July 5th, as dawn broke, the enemy who stubbornly defended the southern corner blockhouse of Bo'ai City was surrounded by our "108" Company, 3rd Battalion. They were still firing wildly, attempting to break through. Liu Qinghai, an eighteen-year-old newly liberated soldier, held a grenade, his finger on the fuse, and advanced cautiously. When he reached fifty meters from the enemy, he shouted: "Don't shoot anymore! I was liberated from Qi County. The Eighth Route Army is the people's army and doesn't kill prisoners..." The enemy continued to fire wildly. He shouted again: "If you don't surrender your guns, I won't be polite!" After a while, hearing some wavering inside, the gunfire gradually subsided. Company Commander Liu Wei also stepped forward and shouted: "Now the entire city gate has been taken down, and those who don't want to fight have laid down their weapons. Discuss it amongst yourselves and answer within a quarter of an hour." There was arguing inside. A guy in a yellow uniform and a big peaked cap peeked out and slipped two guns out of a corner of the blockhouse. Company Commander Liu shouted loudly: "Two guns are not enough, hand over everything." They argued again inside. He continued to shout: "Time's up! It's not worth dying for Old Chiang. If you surrender your guns, you can still go home to see your mother and wife." They were still arguing inside: "If you don't surrender, we'll give you a try!" Artilleryman Chen Liujin set up the gun mount, and Battalion Commander Ji Wanpeng said: "Fire!" With a bang, a shell collapsed the roof of the building, and the enemy soldiers in the blockhouse panicked: "Platoon leader, let's surrender!" Then another shell hit the gun hole, and three fell. The enemy inside shouted: "Eighth Route Army brothers, we surrender!" The soldiers clapped and applauded: "Welcome, surrendered brothers!" Two machine guns, twenty-six rifles, and three Mauser pistols were sent out from the gun hole. Inside, they blew a whistle for "assembly and stand at attention" and walked out of the blockhouse. Company Commander Liu said: "Why didn't you surrender earlier?" The soldiers pointed to the platoon leader and said: "That dog wouldn't let us surrender. We understood what you were saying." Liu Qinghai immediately explained to them: "I was also liberated. We are all poor boys. Look at those three who died for Chiang Kai-shek, what's the point? Don't worry, we won't touch anything of yours." A group of prisoners was sent to the regimental headquarters. (Bai Ruizhang)

    攻心战和开花弹
    七月五日天已大亮，孤守博爱城南角碉堡的敌人，被我“一○八”三连层层包围，但仍在狂射企图突围，十八岁青年新解放战士刘清海握着手榴弹，指勾导火线悄步前进，在离敌五十米达处喊道：“你们不要打啦，我是淇县解放过来的，八路军是老百姓的队伍，不杀俘虏……。”敌人仍在狂射。他又喊道：“你若不缴枪，可就不客气啦！”一会，听着内部有些动摇，枪声逐渐稀疏，连长刘维同志也上前喊道：“现在城关全部打掉了，不愿打的都放下了武器，你们大家讨论一下，限一刻钟答复。”里面在吵嚷，一个穿黄色军衣大帽盖的家伙，偷看一下，从碉堡一角溜出两支枪来。刘连长高声大喊：“两支不行，全部缴出。”里边又大吵起来，他接着又喊：“时间到了，你们为老蒋送死，真不值得，缴了枪，还得回家看看母亲妻子。”里边仍在吵嚷：“不缴枪，叫你试当试当！”炮兵陈六金支好炮架，纪万朋连长说：“开炮！”轰的一炮打塌楼顶，碉堡里敌兵慌乱：“排长、缴枪吧！”接着又是一炮，打着枪眼，三个躺倒了，里面敌人喊了：“八路老兄，我们缴枪啦！”战士们在拍手鼓掌：“欢迎缴枪弟兄！”二挺机枪，二十六支步枪，三支驳壳枪，从枪眼里送出来，里边吹哨子“集合站队”，走出了碉堡。刘连长说：“你们为啥不缴枪？”士兵们指着那个排长说：“他狗日的不叫缴枪，你们喊的话我们都明白。”刘清海马上给他们解释：“我也是解放过来的，咱们都是穷小子，你看那三个替蒋介石当了炮灰，有啥意思？你们放心，我们一点东西也不动。”一群俘虏送到团指挥所去。（白瑞章）
