Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 1st - According to a recent dispatch from Dihua published in Shanghai's Ta Kung Pao, the result of Chiang Kai-shek's five or six years of rule in Xinjiang is that the province's economy and people's livelihood are in a state of utter collapse. Before 1942, when Chiang Kai-shek's bloody claws reached into Xinjiang, the province's prices had risen by less than two times compared to pre-war levels, which could be considered paradise compared to Chiang Kai-shek's old-controlled areas. However, the current prices in Xinjiang are the highest in the country. Chiang's officials, with the motto "a thousand miles to be an official is only for wealth," impose endless taxes, extort money, and inflate the currency, which is the reason for the soaring prices. Before 1942, when Sheng Shicai adopted a policy of accommodating progressive individuals, considerable achievements were made in the construction of transportation, water conservancy, agriculture, animal husbandry, education, and health. After Sheng turned to Chiang Kai-shek, massacred democrats, and was then kicked aside by Chiang Kai-shek himself, these constructions have been utterly destroyed by Chiang Kai-shek. For example, a modern agricultural tool manufacturing plant purchased from the Soviet Union was turned into a dilapidated temple in less than a year and a half. The silkworm industry in southern Xinjiang was also wiped out. Good Ukrainian wheat seeds in the farms were ground into flour and eaten, the eggs of breeding chickens were put on the dining table, even the breeding chickens were killed for entertaining guests, the breeding horses were used to pull rickshaws, and the dyes used for microscopes were made into ink. A large number of foreign dyes, indispensable for the local important handicraft industry—carpets—were all stolen and sold. A member of Chiang's provincial government even suggested: "Let's dig up the tap water pipes from the ground and transport them to other provinces to sell them." Today, Chiang's "construction agencies," like other Chiang-controlled areas, only have the task of collecting salaries besides hanging a sign at the door, because the task of destruction has been completed, and there is no other work to do. It can be seen that since 1943, the Xinjiang people's anti-Chiang tyranny and demand for autonomy are by no means accidental.

    蒋家官员勒索中饱
    新疆建设摧残殆尽
    【新华社陕北一日电】据上海大公报近载迪化通讯透露：蒋介石在新疆统治五六年的结果，该省之民生经济已糜烂不堪。在三十一年蒋介石血爪伸入新疆前，该省物价较战前上升不足两倍，较之蒋介石旧统治区，可算天堂了。但是目前新疆物价之高，却居全国第一。蒋家官员们“千里为官只为财，”无穷的捐税勒索和通货膨胀，即是物价暴涨的原因。民国三十一年以前，当盛世才采取容纳进步人士政策时，交通、水利、农业、畜牧、教育、卫生的建设，都曾有相当成就。当盛转而投靠蒋介石屠杀民主分子，从而他本人亦被蒋介石一脚踢开之后，这些建设已被蒋介石破坏罄尽。例如旧时由苏联购来的一个现代化的农具制造厂，不到一年半就弄得像一座破庙。南疆的蚕丝事业也被一扫而光，农场里良好乌克兰麦种被磨面吃了，种鸡的蛋已上了吃饭桌子，连种鸡也杀来请客了，种马用来拖皮包车了，显微镜用的染色素做了墨水了，为当地重要手工业——地毯所不可少的大批外国染料统统偷卖了。一位蒋记省府委员还提议：“把自来水管从地下挖出来运到外省卖了吧”。到如今蒋家“建设机关”和其他蒋管区一样，除在门口挂个招牌外，唯一任务就是领薪水，因为破坏的任务已经完成，现已别无工作了。可见自民国三十二年迄今，新疆人民反蒋家虐政要求自治决非偶然。
