Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 6th. Dispatches from all sources: Before returning to his country, Bulgarian Prime Minister Dimitrov made a statement to reporters in the capital of South Korea regarding the South Korean-Bulgarian mutual aid treaty, which stated: The Brot talks reached an agreement in a spirit of sincerity and mutual understanding without any differences, which has historical significance for the Balkan people and their future. We clearly recognize that the current situation in the Balkans is unstable. The civil war in Greece, the situation in Turkey, and certain conspiracies by foreign countries in these countries are hindering our own development and the strengthening of relations between the two countries. We will never interfere in Greece's internal affairs, but we cannot remain indifferent to the provocative actions of the Greek fascists on our borders. We will defend ourselves with the joint efforts of our two countries. Dimitrov pointed out that the decisions of the Brot Conference demonstrate the great strength of the democratic construction currently underway in South Korea and Bulgaria; the creators of our People's Republics rely on the strength of the people, and we will never exchange national independence and sovereignty at any cost. Neither gold coins, pounds, nor even the threat of atomic bombs can make us deviate from the correct path that the people should take. Dimitrov also said: Because the Bulgarian people only participated in the anti-German struggle in the later stages of the war, although the Bulgarian people suffered great sacrifices in the struggle and war against fascist rule, some countries still recognize it as a German satellite country and impose harsh treaty terms. They say that Bulgaria should pay $45 million in compensation to Greece, but even if Greece only asks for $5 million in compensation, it is unfounded.
　　On the 3rd, at a mass rally in Sofia, Dimitrov strongly praised the achievements of the talks as having made a great contribution to the creation of lasting peace in the Balkans, Europe, and the world. The two countries have already undertaken the next task, which is to transform the Balkans, which is a powder keg and hotbed of war, into a bulwark of peace and democracy, into a factor of stability in the European situation, and into a factor of friendly cooperation among all nations in the world. Dimitrov expressed his heartfelt gratitude to Yugoslavia for its noble friendship in abandoning the 25 million US dollars of reparations stipulated in the treaty.

　　季米特洛夫赞南保条约
    两国负担任务变巴尔干为和平民主堡垒
    条约显示两国新民主主义建设伟大力量
    【新华社陕北六日电】各方讯：保加利亚总理季米特洛夫回国前，在南国首都对记者就南保互助条约发表谈话，略称：布罗特会谈在诚恳互谅的精神下绝无丝毫纷歧地获得了协议，这对于巴尔干人民及其将来都具有历史意义。我们清楚的认识到目前巴尔干的局势是不稳定的，希腊的内战、土耳其的情势以及外国在这些国家的某种阴谋活动，都妨碍我们自己的发展与两国间关系的加强。我们决不干涉希腊的内政，但对希腊法西斯在我们边界的挑衅行为决不能漠然置之，我们将以我们两国的共同努力，来保卫我们自己。季氏指出：布罗特会议的决定显示出现正在南保两国进行的民主主义建设的伟大力量；我们人民共和国的创造者们依靠人民的力量，我们绝不将国家的独立与主权以任何代价交换，不论金元、英镑，甚至原子弹的威胁，也不能使我们离开人民应走的正确道路。季氏又说：保国人民因为在大战后期才参加反德斗争，保国人民虽然在反对法西斯统治的斗争与战争中受到巨大牺牲，仍然有某些国家认之为德国的卫星国，而课之以严厉的和约条款，他们说保加利亚应当付四千五百万美元的赔款给希腊，但是希腊即使只要求五百万美元的赔款，也是没有根据的。
    季米特洛夫于三日在索菲亚群众热烈的欢迎大会上，极力赞扬会谈成就已为巴尔干、欧洲与世界持久和平的缔造作了巨大贡献。两国已经负担起下一任务，就是作为战争的火药库与温床的巴尔干，变成和平与民主的堡垒，变成欧洲局势稳定的因素，变成世界各民族间友爱合作的因素。季氏对南斯拉夫放弃和约规定之二千五百万美元赔款之高贵友谊，表示衷心感谢。
