Moving Towards Zhao Shuli's Direction
荒煤 (Huang Mei)

At our recent literary symposium, we primarily discussed Comrade Zhao Shuli's works. Everyone agreed that to review the literary creations in the border region over the past year, it is best to have a relatively consistent understanding of Comrade Zhao Shuli's works. His works can serve as a benchmark for measuring the creations in the border region because his works are most welcomed by the broad masses.

After many days of heated discussion and research, many issues related to literature and art were touched upon, but we reached a consensus on some fundamental issues. Finally, everyone agreed to put forward the "Zhao Shuli Direction" as a call for launching a creative movement in the literary and art circles of the border region!

What aspects of Comrade Zhao Shuli's creations should we learn from him? Based on our understanding, there are the following three points:

First, Comrade Zhao Shuli's works are highly political. He reflects the fundamental contradiction and complex and acute struggles between the landlord class and the peasants. He writes from the perspective of the people, with clear love and hate, and with strong class emotions. His thoughts and feelings are integrated with the people.

Comrade Zhao Shuli's several important works, regardless of their themes and subjects, are all sharply excavating the basic contradictions in rural reality: On one side are the likes of Xing Wang, Yan Hengyuan, and Li Ruzhen, landlords, bullies, and their lackeys, who, during the warlord melee, the War of Resistance Against Japan, the enemy-puppet rule, and even under the new democratic regime, are closely intertwined, doing everything in their power to dominate the people and maintain their blood-sucking rule. On the other side is a group of poor peasants who have been "crushed" and the new generation of "youngsters." They suffer from the exploitation and oppression of the landlord class, gradually become aware and unite. Once they throw themselves into the struggle, they erupt into a great liberation movement with unstoppable enthusiasm and strength, and are tempered to be so strong and firm, producing representative figures of the masses like Tiesuo and Leng Yuan, the image of new peasants. These two opposing camps are very clearly divided in Comrade Shuli's writing. His works, from "Xiao Erhei's Marriage" to "The Changes in Li Family Village," depict the struggles that occur between these two camps in various different occasions, times, and events, inevitable, subtle and complex, acute and cruel struggles!

As soon as Comrade Zhao Shuli's pen touches the landlord class, he profoundly and concretely exposes their sinister wickedness, vividly portraying the odious typical characters of the landlord class. When the pen turns to the peasants and the "youngsters," the writing is filled with full sympathy and love, and the pen tip dances. How affectionately and adorably he writes about these new peasants who have grown up in suffering and struggle! He only praises these figures, praising their youth and enthusiasm, their courage and wit in struggle, and their hatred for the landlords. He also satirizes the backward peasants, but with sympathy, generosity, and the hope that they will change. Even "Er Kongming" doesn't evoke any sense of "hatred."

Comrade Zhao Shuli's works reflect one aspect of the great changing process in the liberated areas' countryside from various angles. Whether it is the arrangement of the story, the depiction of the characters' psychology, actions, thoughts, and feelings, we never feel unnatural or contrived. What is the reason for this? We believe that this is because he has a clear class stand, he lives and struggles with the characters in his works, and his thoughts and feelings are completely integrated with the people and the thoughts and feelings of the peasants he portrays. This is the first thing that intellectual literary and art workers should learn.

Of course, Comrade Shuli was born into a poor peasant family, grew up in the countryside, and is familiar with the lives of the masses. But he has cultivated this style and habit: when living in a village, he participates in village work; when living in a farmer's home, he first understands his landlord; he pays attention to investigation and research at all times. He lives with the peasants like a peasant and has a very concrete understanding of the people. This is also something that should be learned well.

Second, Comrade Zhao Shuli's creation is the selection of language that lives on the lips of the masses and the creation of a lively new national form that is welcomed by the broad masses.

The biggest feature of Comrade Zhao Shuli's creation is the use of concise and rich mass language in all narration and description. These languages have also been proven to be very vivid and powerful in describing the psychology and actions of the masses, and even in describing scenery! The complete use of these living colloquialisms in creation, especially today, to express the current intense turmoil, struggle life, and the formation of new peasants in the countryside... how much fresher, clearer, livelier, and more powerful it is than the stiff, intellectual-flavored language!

Only the language of the masses can create a new national form welcomed by the masses, and therefore can reflect the current lives and struggles of the masses. Comrade Zhao Shuli's works are a good proof of this. We believe that Comrade Shuli's achievements in the language form of his creation are due to the following characteristics:

1.  Choosing the living language of the masses. When choosing words, Comrade Shuli first considers whether the masses can understand it. Before, when he wrote articles, he first considered whether his father (a poor peasant) could understand it, and later he first considered whether his son (a district and village cadre) could understand it. He tried to avoid using words and phrases that are not commonly used in the masses' mouths in his writing; when it was necessary to use them, he would definitely add annotations. In short, in his own words, it is to use "the language that lives on the lips of the masses."

2.  Focusing on writing stories. The habits and traditions of the masses do not easily accept reading materials without stories. Comrade Shuli's works all have strong storytelling, and therefore, in terms of structure, he advocates that the first thing is to be "smooth," fluent, organized, and with a beginning and an end, and the second is to be "connected," connecting in one breath, with clear and simple clues.

3.  Neither the characters nor the scenery are described separately and lengthily, but are interspersed in the action. The characters' psychology and personality are also expressed in their own actions, or through the observation (with class character) of others, to express the characters' image, psychology, and actions. In short, the characters and environment he describes are emphatically placed in the middle of the struggle action, and no narration and description irrelevant to the real struggle is made.

These characteristics, in addition to explaining that Comrade Zhao Shuli's creative expression also embodies the mass viewpoint, also show that he is very familiar with folk forms and respects folk forms. His creation clearly and critically accepts the excellent traditions of Chinese folk novels, but he uses the living language of today's masses to describe the current struggle reality. After his own refinement, he has created a new form. This new form is popularized. But we cannot think that only popularized language and writing can produce a new form. Many past experiences in popularization have already proven this. Rich realistic content must go through considerable artistic processing, and break through the old artistic forms, to produce a new form. In other words, rich content and novel forms are consistent and harmonious. Comrade Shuli's works are like this. In his works, content and form are consistent, and popularization and artistry are well combined. His creation is the art of the people, a very good art.

Third, Comrade Zhao Shuli's engagement in literary creation truly achieves wholehearted service to the people. He has a high degree of revolutionary utilitarianism and a spirit of long-term hard work and seeking truth from facts.

Fifteen years ago, Comrade Zhao Shuli had such thoughts and had done such writing: to "seize the feudal cultural position." He felt that China's "literary world was too high, and the masses could not climb up, it is best to fold it down and pave it into small stalls." He was determined to squeeze his own works into "Xiaolin Guangji" and "Seven Heroes and Five Gallants" first, and then he could talk about "seizing." Comrade Zhao Shuli's early purpose of writing was like this.

For more than ten years, Comrade Shuli has insisted on popularization work, writing many novels, fast-clappers, small operas, and other texts in small newspaper supplements, on the streets, and in troupes... His life and work have encountered considerable setbacks, but he has always adhered to his ambition to seize the feudal cultural position. In his work, he has never cared about personal reputation or status, nor does he want to regard his creation as "art" - that kind of art that is detached from the masses. He did not aspire to write in order to express himself or to become a writer. His motives and purposes for writing were all for the masses, for the battle, and for raising and solving certain problems. This is the case now, and it was the case before the War of Resistance Against Japan. Therefore, he does not write much, let alone write indiscriminately. In his own words, it is to "make the people like to watch and play a political role!"

These two sentences are the most essential understanding of Chairman Mao's literary and artistic line, and should also be our most simple idea and most concrete practice of implementing Chairman Mao's literary and artistic line.

Comrade Zhao Shuli's creation is the most simple and concrete practice of Chairman Mao's literary and artistic line, so he has achieved such brilliant achievements! This is the result of his long-term, truth-seeking struggle and efforts, after his life, thoughts, feelings, and creative preparations have long been matured.

Because of the above points that we can commonly recognize, we feel that the "Zhao Shuli Direction" should be put forward as our banner, calling on literary and art workers in the border region to learn from him and keep up with him!

Of course, direction is not a model. Learning from Comrade Zhao Shuli and following the Zhao Shuli direction will never restrict the further free development of literary and artistic creation or limit the diversity of forms of literary and artistic creation.

Comrade Zhao Shuli's creation has created a new form, and this new form will continue to develop and become more perfect. Simply imitating from the form cannot solve the problem. The fundamental problem for literary and art workers today is still to combine with the thoughts and feelings of workers, peasants, and soldiers. Only in this way can the problem of form be truly and finally solved. Naturally, literary and art workers from intellectual backgrounds must also be determined to abandon, without any nostalgia, the form of expression that uses intellectual language. This is not such an easy thing to do.

Today, looking back on the creations in the border region over the past year, we should affirm that a large number of new works that have emerged from the patriotic self-defense war and the land reform movement have a new atmosphere, are more simple and vivid, are closer to colloquialism, and have more or less explored the language of the masses. This is a gratifying phenomenon. But compared to the great changes of reality today, the achievements of our creation are too small. In order to better reflect the real struggle, we must better learn from Comrade Zhao Shuli! Let's all move forward in big strides in the direction of Zhao Shuli!

    向赵树理方向迈进
    荒煤
    我们这次文艺座谈会，首先讨论了赵树理同志的创作，大家认为：要检讨一年来边区的文艺创作，最好对赵树理同志的作品有比较一致的认识：他的作品可以作为衡量边区创作的一个标尺，因为他的作品最为广大群众所欢迎。
    经过好多天热烈的讨论与研究，所接触到文艺方面的问题很多，但在一些基本的问题上，我们都获得一致的见解。最后，大家都同意提出赵树理方向，作为边区文艺界开展创作运动的一个号召！
    赵树理同志的创作有那些是我们应该向他很好学习的呢？根据我们的了解，有以下三点：
    第一、赵树理同志的作品政治性是很强的。他反映了地主阶级与农民的基本矛盾，复杂而尖锐的斗争。他是站在人民的立场来写的，爱憎分明，有强烈的阶级情感，思想情绪是与人民打成一片的。
    赵树理同志的几部重要作品，无论其主题与题材都各不相同，但他的笔都尖锐的掘发着农村现实中的基本矛盾：一面是兴旺、阎恒元、李如珍之流，地主恶霸及其狗腿们，在军阀混战、抗战、敌伪统治时期，甚至在新民主主义政权下面，无不牢牢相靠，纠缠在一起，尽其一切力量盘踞在人民头上，保持其吸血统治；一面是一群被“压碎”了的贫苦农民及新生的一代“小字辈”的人物，他们遭受地主阶级的剥削压迫，逐渐觉悟团结起来，一旦投身到斗争去，就以不可抑止的热情与力量，爆发了大翻身运动。而且被锻炼得那样钢强和坚定，产生了铁锁、冷元等广大群众的代表人物，新农民的形象。这两个对立的阵营在树理同志的笔下划分得非常清楚。他的作品，从小二黑结婚到李家庄变迁，就是描写了这两个阵营在各种不同的场合、时间与事件中所发生的斗争，不可避免的，微妙复杂、尖锐残酷的斗争！
    赵树理同志的笔只要一触及地主阶级，就极其深刻具体的揭发他们的阴险凶毒，活灵活现的刻划出地主阶级可憎恶的典型。当笔转到农民及小字辈的人物身上时，笔下就处处流露出了充分的同情和热爱，笔尖跳动起来，他把这些在苦难中斗争中生长起来的新农民写得多么亲切可爱啊！他对于这些人物只有歌颂，歌颂他们的年青与热情，斗争中的勇敢和机智，以及对地主的仇恨。他对落后的农民也有讽刺，但是同情的，宽大的，希望他们改变的。即连如“二孔明”，我们也不能丝毫感到是可“憎”的。
    赵树理同志的作品从各个角度反映了解放区农村伟大的改变过程之一部。无论故事的安排，人物的心理、行动、思想情感的描写，都从不使我们感到很不自然，矫揉造作，这是什么原因呢？我们认为这就是因为他有鲜明的阶级立场，他和他作品中的人物一同生活，一同斗争，思想情绪与人民与他所表现的农民的思想情绪完全融合的结果。这也就是智识分子文艺工作者首先要学习的一点。
    固然，树理同志出身贫苦农民家庭，生长在农村，熟悉群众生活，但他养成了这一种作风与习惯：住在村里就参加驻村工作，住在农民家里就首先了解自己的房东，随时注意调查研究，他和一个农民一样的和农民生活在一起，非常具体的了解人民。这一点也是应该很好学习的。
    第二：赵树理同志的创作是选择了活在群众口头上的语言，创造了生动活泼的，为广大群众所欢迎的民族新形式。
    赵树理同志创作的最大特点：在全部叙述与描写时也运用了简练而丰富的群众语言。这些语言在描写群众的心理，行动，以至写景，同样被证明是很生动，很有魄力！这些活生生的口语在创作中全部的运用，特别在今天来表现当前农村激烈的动荡，斗争的生活，新农民的形成……较之生硬的智识分子气味语言，又如何显得新鲜，明朗，活泼而有力啊！
    惟有群众的语言才能创造群众所欢迎的民族新形式，因此也才能反映当前的群众生活与斗争。赵树理同志的作品是很好的证明。我们认为：树理同志创作上语言形式方面所获之成就，是由于有以下的特点：
    一、选择群众的活的语言，树理同志选择用语时，首先考虑群众听不听得懂。他以前写文章，先考虑他父亲（一个贫苦农民）是否能听得懂，以后先考虑他儿子（一个区村干部）是否能听懂。凡是群众口头不常用的词句，他在写作时就尽量避免用；必须选用时，一定加以注释。总之，用他自己的话来说：就是运用“活在群众口头上的语言”。
    二、着重写故事。群众的习惯与传统是不容易接受没有故事的读物的。树理同志的作品故事性都强，也因之，他在结构方面主张第一要“顺”，流畅、有条理、有头有尾，其次要“连”，连结一气，头绪清晰，单纯。
    三、不论人物、风景都不作单独冗长的叙述与描写，都是夹杂在行动中来叙述描写。人物的心理与个性也是在自己的行动中来表现，或者通过旁人的观察（有阶级性的）来表现人物的形象，心理与行动。总之，他所描写的人物与环境都是被着重的安插在斗争的行动中间，不作与现实斗争无关的叙述与描写。
    这些特点：除了说明赵树理同志创作表现方法上也贯彻着群众观点，也说明了他很熟悉民间形式，尊重民间形式。他的创作很明显的批判的接受了中国民间小说的优秀传统，然而他以今天群众的活的语言描绘了当前的斗争现实，经过自己的提炼，他创造了一种新形式。这种新形式是通俗化的。但我们却不能以为，仅仅是通俗的语言、文字就能产生新形式，过去有许多通俗化的工作经验已经证明了。丰富的现实内容必须经过相当的艺术加工，又突破旧的艺术形式，才能产生新形式。换句话说，丰富的内容与新颖的形式是一致的，谐合的。树理同志的作品就是如此。他的作品，内容与形式是一致的，大众化与艺术性是很好的结合起来了，他的创作是人民大众的艺术，很好的艺术。
    第三：赵树理同志的从事文学创作，真正作到全心全意的为人民服务。他具有高度的革命功利主义，和长期埋头苦干，实事求是的精神。
    十五年前，赵树理同志就有过这样的思想，也曾做过这样的写作：要“夺取封建文化阵地”。他感到中国当时的“文坛太高了，群众攀不上去，最好折下来铺成小摊子。他立志要把自己的作品先挤进“笑林广记”、“七侠五义”里边去，然后才能谈得到“夺取”。赵树理同志早先从事写作的目的就是如此。
    十余年来，树理同志坚持通俗化工作，在小报纸副刊，在街头，在剧团………写过不少小说、快板，小戏及其他文字，生活与工作都曾遭到相当的挫折，但始终如一坚持了夺取封建文化阵地的志愿。工作中从未计较过个人的名誉、地位，也不想把自己的创作当作“艺术”——那种脱离群众的艺术。也不是为了表现自己，为了成功一个作家，才立志写作，他写作的动机和目的，都是为了群众的，为了战斗的，为了提出与解决某些问题的，现在是如此，抗战前就是如此的，因此他不多写，更不乱写，用他自己的话来说：是要“老百姓喜欢看，政治上起作用！”
    这两句话是毛主席文艺方针最本质的认识，也应该是我们实践毛主席文艺方针最朴素的想法，最具体的作法。
    赵树理同志的创作就是最朴素、最具体的实践了毛主席的文艺方针，因此他获得如此光辉的成就！这是他在生活、思想情感与创作准备各方面都早已成熟，又经过长时间实事求是的奋斗与努力的结果。
    因为以上我们所能共同认识到的几点，我们觉得，应该把赵树理方向提出来，作为我们的旗帜，号召边区文艺工作者向他学习、看齐！
    当然，方向不是模型，向赵树理同志学习，走赵树理方向，绝不会限制了文艺创作更进一步的自由发展，限制文艺创作的形式的多样性。
    赵树理同志的创作，创造了一种新形式，这新形式也仍会继续发展，更趋完美。单纯的从形式来模仿是不能解决问题的。文艺工作者今天的根本问题仍是与工、农、兵思想情感相结合，也惟有如此，才能最后的真正的解决了形式问题——自然，智识分子出身的文艺工作者还必须决心，毫不留恋的抛弃那种用智识分子语言来表现的形式。这也还不是那样很容易的一件事情。
    今天来回顾一年来的边区创作，我们应该肯定：从爱国自卫战争及土地改革运动中所涌现的一大批新的作品，都有了新的气息，都比较朴素生动，更接近口语化，或多或少都发掘了群众的语言，这是一个可喜的现象。但较之今天这样伟大变动的现实来，我们的创作的成绩就太微小了。为了更好的反映现实斗争，我们就必须更好的学习赵树理同志！大家向赵树理的方向大踏步前进吧！
