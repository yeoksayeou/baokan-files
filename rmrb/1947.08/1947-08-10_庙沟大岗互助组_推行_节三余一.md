    Miaogou Dagang Mutual Aid Team
    Promotes "Save Three, Spare One"
    [This newspaper, Taiyue, 8th dispatch] The Shimin Miaogou Dagang Mutual Aid Team advocates "Save Three, Spare One" to prepare for famine, that is, save three months' worth of grain to have one month's worth to spare. Take team member Feng Shiliang as an example. His family of four harvested eighteen *shi* of grain last year, originally planning to eat until the end of the sixth month of the lunar calendar this year. This summer harvest, seeing the wheat harvest was poor and the autumn seedlings insufficient, and famine had become a reality, they formulated a "Save Three, Spare One" plan. In the past, his family needed an average of five *dou* of mixed grains per person per month for food and other expenses, averaging one *jin* and three *liang* of millet per person per day. Since the fourth month of the lunar calendar, they have saved five *liang* of millet per person per day, avoided visiting relatives, and reduced all household expenses as much as possible. In the three months of April, May, and June, they have saved one hundred and twelve *jin* of millet, which can provide one month of food. The three *shi* and four *dou* of wheat harvested this summer, mixed with two and a half *dou* of chaff per *dou*, can be made into *@ @* for breakfast and dinner, saving another month's worth of grain, so they can continue to eat until the end of the tenth month of the lunar calendar this year.

    庙沟大岗互助组
    推行“节三余一”
    【本报太岳八日电】士敏庙沟大岗互助组提倡“节三余一”备荒，即节约三月余一月粮。比如组员冯世良吧，他全家四口人，去年打了十八石粮食，原计划吃到今年阴历六月底。今年夏收，看到麦子歉收，秋苗不足，灾荒已成，就订了一个节三余一的计划，他家过去每人每月连吃带花，平均需杂粮五斗，每人每天平均吃用小米一斤三两。自阴历四月起，每天每人节约小米五两，不走亲戚，不用灯油，尽量减少一切家庭杂支，四、五、六三个月已节约下小米一百一十二斤，可供一个月的食用，今年夏天收的三石四斗麦子，每斗掺糠二斗半，早上晚上做＠＠吃又可节余一个月的粮食，这样便可以一直吃到今年阴历十月底。
