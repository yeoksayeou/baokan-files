Editor's Note: This letter was collectively written by the Twelfth Company of the New Nineteenth Regiment of a certain brigade under General Chen Geng's command and was recently forwarded by Comrade Wang Zhiyao of that brigade. Reading this letter is like seeing blood-boiling soldiers, and between the lines is full of the conviction that the counter-offensive will be victorious. On the occasion of "August 1st," we have slightly modified the wording and published it here to show the strength and justice of our People's Liberation Army.

Chairman Mao:

    Under your leadership, we have turned ourselves over,
    Enjoyed democracy and freedom,
    And started a happy life.
    But at the mention of the past,
    Who doesn't feel sorrow and pain?
    Our entire company has one hundred and fifty-one people,
    The oppression we have suffered is truly beyond words,
    One hundred and forty of us have told of our grievances,
    One hundred and twenty-six of us have been exploited,
    And suffered ten to fifteen years of hardship!
    We have eaten chaff and swallowed bark,
    Ninety-one of us have been verbally abused and beaten,
    And the scars still remain.
    Twenty-four of us have already lost our beloved parents,
    Our parents toiled all their lives,
    But finally starved to death.
    Our suffering is endless,
    But we all want to tell you,
    Dear Chairman Mao!

    Comrade Zhang Desheng's family,
    Owned thirty mu of land,
    His father was plowing the field,
    When he encountered the Kuomintang army,
    The livestock were snatched away,
    His father knelt down and begged,
    And was beaten to death!
    His elder brother was captured,
    And falsely accused of being a disguised Eighth Route Army soldier,
    And shot in the south gate of Jingle County,
    His body was not allowed to be claimed for three days,
    His mother fainted several times from crying.
    In 1943, he was drafted into the army by the Yan [Xishan] bandits,
    Assigned to the Second Division of the First Cavalry Army,
    To be a scapegoat for Yan Xishan,
    He said: "Heaven has eyes! I was rescued from the pit of fire by Chairman Mao in the Fenxiao Campaign."
    Such tragic events,
    Liu Jie, Liu Jiayu, Cao Xiandong...
    Comrades from South and North China;
    Have all had the same experiences.

    Liu Guanjie's family,
    In Fuyang County, Anhui,
    Eleven family members including father, brother, and grandmother,
    Owned twenty mu of land and fifteen rooms,
    In 1938, the Chiang bandits used the "Yellow River to resist Japan,"
    Opening the breach, millions of people were fed to the fish,
    His family was also completely wiped out.
    Whenever he mentions the return of the Yellow River to its original course,
    He sadly beats his chest and says:
    Chiang Kai-shek used the Yellow River to flood our liberated areas,
    I will fight him to the end!
    Chiang Kai-shek is a good bandit!
    Let's settle the score!
    The deep hatred of blood and tears, how can we tolerate you?
    Chiang Kai-shek, I tell you!
    We are now awakened,
    If we want peace, we can only completely destroy you!
    In one year of war,
    We have annihilated about a hundred of your brigades,
    And recovered vast territories,
    You are forced to retreat into defense,
    You still want to hide in a dog hole to rest;
    And then fight us again?
    Impossible! Now we are going to strike out,
    Chiang and Hu bandits!
    Wait, we will come to eliminate you immediately.

    Chairman Mao, the Party Central Committee,
    Our grievances must be settled!
    Therefore, we raise our arms and shout;
    Requesting an order to attack the traitor Chiang Kai-shek,
    We swear to the Party,
    To follow Chairman Mao forever,
    If the peasants do not get land and cannot turn themselves over,
    If Chiang Kai-shek is not completely eliminated, we will never live in safety,
    We are determined to fight to the end!
    We demand to strike out,
    We have studied the difficulties,
    Shi Qilin said: I have prepared legs for marching!
    Zhang Chouji said: I have prepared a mouth for eating millet!
    Comrade Wang Qingming: Proposed "three no fear,"
    Not afraid of walking at night,
    Not afraid of climbing mountains,
    Not afraid of eating millet;
    Feng Baosheng said: I am not afraid of rain or wind;
    Duan Fengsuo is from the liberated area,
    He wants to kill the Hu Zongnan bad guy in his old nest,
    He said: Isn't this protecting the liberated area even more?
    Shi Qiyun is from the KMT-controlled area,
    He said excitedly:
    I have been liberated,
    But my family is still under oppression,
    I want to fight back to eliminate the Chiang bandits and liberate my parents!
    We have a unanimous opinion,
    Requesting to strike out,
    Determined to achieve the "four three system".
    First guarantee to serve the people to the end:
    1. Not returning home until land reform is realized and all the peasants of the country are liberated.
    2. Not returning home until Chiang Kai-shek is completely eliminated.
    3. Not returning home without rendering a great service to the people.
    Second guarantee not to bow to difficulties:
    1. Not afraid of walking at night during marching, not afraid of climbing mountains in strong winds and heavy rain.
    2. Not afraid of difficult living and eating millet.
    3. Not complaining to superiors when encountering difficulties, thinking of ways to overcome them.
    Third guarantee that the whole company will be in a perfect mood to strike out:
    1. Abandoning family burdens, going wherever the superiors order.
    2. Taking care of one's health, not drinking cold water, not getting sick, not dropping out of the team for minor illnesses, helping each other.
    3. Understanding each other, uniting, loving, and learning from each other.
    Fourth guarantee to abide by mass discipline:
    1. Achieving three don'ts:
    2. Achieving three don't takes:
    3. Publicizing our Party's policies and strengthening the relationship between the army and the people.

    These were all proposed by one hundred percent of us,
    We also donated: 98,660 Jicha banknotes,
    Two gold rings, one bracelet,
    And shoes, clothes, towels, etc.,
    These are all considered as guarantees,
    For leading model comrades to perform meritorious service,
    If what we say is not done,
    We are willing to be punished with double the discipline.

    Now everything is ready,
    Only waiting for an order from the superiors?
    To call us to strike out,
    To avenge our hatred, to wash away the shame of the nation,
    We call on all comrades,
    To rise up for peace, democracy, independence, and land,
    To attack the national traitor Chiang Kai-shek;
    The Twelfth Company is ready to go,
    Requesting to strike out as soon as possible!

### 一封热血沸腾的宣誓书

专栏：

    一封热血沸腾的宣誓书
    编者按：此书为陈赓将军部下某旅新十九团十二连集体写作，近日由该旅王志遥同志转寄来。读此书如见热血沸腾之战士，字里行间，充满反攻必胜之信念。兹值“八一”，特稍加字句修改，发表于此，以见我人民解放军之坚强与正义。                
    毛主席：
    我们在你的领导下翻了身，
    享受了民主自由，
    过起了幸福的生活。
    但一提起往事，
    谁不悲疼伤心，
    我们全连有一百五十一个人，
    我们曾受过的压迫，真是一言难尽，
    我们一百四十个人诉出了冤苦，
    我们有一百二十六个人被剥削过，
    受过了十年到十五年的苦罪！
    我们吃过糠也咽过树皮，
    我们有九十一个人遭过辱骂毒打，
    瘢痕至今尚存。
    我们有二十四个人已经失去了亲爱的爹娘，
    我们的爹娘劳动了一辈子，
    但终于饿死了。
    我们的苦难诉不完，
    但我们都要告诉你，
    亲爱的毛主席！?                
    张德胜同志的家，
    有地三十亩整，
    父亲正在犁地，
    遇上种（中）殃（央）军，
    牲口被抢走了，
    父亲跪下来央告，
    活活给打死了！
    哥哥叫人家捉住，
    硬说是八路便衣，
    枪毙在静乐县南关里，
    三天也不叫起尸体，
    母亲哭的昏死过几次。
    三十二年他又被阎贼抓了丁，
    补到骑一军第二师，
    给阎锡山当替死鬼，
    他说：“天有眼！汾孝战役被毛主席救出火坑。”
    象这样的惨事，
    刘杰、刘家玉、曹先栋……
    华南华北的同志；
    都有过同样的遭遇。                
    刘贯九的家，
    在安徽阜阳县，
    父兄祖母十一口人，
    有地二十亩，房十五间，
    三八年蒋贼拿“黄河抗日”，
    开了河口千万人民被喂了鱼，
    他的家也一洗无余。
    他一提起黄河归故，
    就难过的捶着心说：
    蒋介石拿黄河淹咱解放区，
    我非和你拚到底！
    蒋介石好贼呀！
    咱算算帐吧！
    血泪的深仇，那能容你？
    蒋介石我告诉你！
    我们现在觉悟了，
    要想和平只有彻底毁灭了你！
    一年的战争
    咱消灭你约一百个旅，
    又收复了广大的土地，
    你被迫要走向防御了，
    你还想躲在狗洞里休息休息；
    再和咱们大干吗？
    不可能！现在俺们就要打出去，
    蒋胡贼子！
    等着吧，我们马上来消灭你。          
    毛主席，党中央，
    我们的冤苦要清算呀！
    所以我们振臂高呼；
    请求下令讨伐蒋逆贼子，
    我们向党宣誓，
    永远跟上毛主席走，
    农民得不了土地翻不了身，
    蒋介石不彻底消灭决不偷生，
    我们决战斗到底！
    我们要求打出去，
    我们研究了困难，
    史其林说：我准备了行军的腿！
    张丑鸡说：我准备了吃小米的嘴！
    王清明同志：提出了“三不怕”，
    不怕走夜路，
    不怕爬山，
    不怕吃小米；
    冯保胜说：我不怕下雨刮风；
    段逢锁是解放区的，
    他要把胡宗南坏蛋杀死在老窠里，
    他说：这不更保卫了解放区吗？
    史其云是蒋管区的人，
    他兴奋的说：
    我被解放了，
    但我的家还受压迫，
    我要打回去消灭蒋贼解放我父母！
    我们有一个一致的意见，
    请求打出去，
    决心做到“四三制”。
    第一保证为人民服务到底：
    １、不实现土地改革不解放全
    国农民不回家，
    ２、不彻底消灭蒋介石不回家，
    ３、不为人民立一件大功不回家，
    第二保证不向困难低头：
    １、行军不怕走夜路，爬山不怕刮风下大雨，
    ２、生活不怕艰难吃小米，
    ３、遇到困难不埋怨上级，想办法来克服。
    第三保证全连情绪圆满打出去：
    １、丢掉家庭包袱，上级叫到那里就到那里，
    ２、爱护自己身体，不喝冷水，不发生病号，轻病不掉
    队，互相帮助。
    ３、打通思想团结爱护互相学
    习。
    第四保证遵守群众纪律：
    １、实现三不走，
    ２、做到三不拿，
    ３、宣传我党政策、密切军民
    关系。
    这些都是我们百分之百的人亲
    口提出来的，
    我们又献出：冀钞九万八千六百六十元
    、金戒指二枚、手镯一只，
    还有皮鞋衣物手巾等等，
    这些都算作保证金，
    带头立功的模范同志，
    我们说的话如果做不到，
    甘愿受纪律加倍制裁。
    现在万事俱备，
    只待上级一道命令？
    叫我们打出去，
    报我们的仇，雪国家之耻，
    我们号召全体同志，
    起来为和平、民主、独立、土地，
    讨伐国贼蒋介石；
    十二连持枪待命，
    要求早日打出去！
