    Xinhua News Agency, Northeast, 4th: A part of the local armed forces of the Liaonan Democratic Allied Army recently completely annihilated the Chiang-Hu bandits entrenched in the Longwang Temple and Luotuo Peak area northeast of Gushan County, capturing over a hundred alive. Thus, all the scattered Chiang-puppet bandits in the newly liberated area of Southern Liaoning have been wiped out.
    Xinhua News Agency, Northeast, 4th: A certain company of the Northeast Democratic Allied Army's Sixth Company is conducting education for liberated soldiers in a new way. Every time liberated soldiers arrive, the entire company holds a welcome meeting, and new and old soldiers introduce their histories to each other. Research groups composed of the squad leader, deputy squad leader, and combat team leader in each squad promptly study methods to help the liberated soldiers. The company promptly commends liberated soldiers who have performed meritorious service to inspire their confidence in achieving merits, and mobilizes everyone to participate in the merit-making movement. As a result, the company achieved within a short period of time that twenty-five liberated soldiers and veteran soldiers have become one, and their combat enthusiasm is extremely high. They are now making competition proposals to strive to be people's meritorious servants.
    Xinhua News Agency, Northeast, 3rd: The Northeast Daily recently published an editorial entitled "Organize Urban Forces to Support the Front." The editorial called for mobilizing one-third of the urban manpower and material resources in the Northeast Liberated Area to support the Patriotic Self-Defense War. The editorial pointed out that the fact that Harbin completed the plan to have two thousand three hundred young people join the army (more than half of whom were workers and poor peasants) and three thousand laborers participate in the war within half a month, and is mobilizing people from all walks of life to complete 200,000 pairs of victory shoes by the end of August, shows that mobilizing urban manpower and material resources to support the Patriotic Self-Defense War is not only necessary but also fully possible. Therefore, the work of urban support for the front should not be relaxed by excusing the difference between urban and rural areas, but should be further strengthened to organize urban manpower and material resources vigorously and for a long time to actively support the front. First of all, eliminate the ideas of "peaceful construction" in the minds of cadres, emphasize the concept of hardship, and make all work in the city focus on the victory of the front. The editorial also pointed out that in the future, it is necessary to launch street struggles extensively and deeply, mainly with workers and poor peasants, eliminate the remnants of the enemy and puppets, destroy feudal forces, thoroughly defeat the old regime, and severely crack down on unscrupulous merchants who engage in speculation, hoarding, and profiteering. Boldly promote active elements from poor and clean workers and poor people in the movement to establish the superiority of the basic masses, and combine the mobilization of the masses with support for the front, so as to lay a solid foundation for long-term support for the Patriotic Self-Defense War.

    辽南新收复区
    蒋匪全部肃清
    【新华社东北四日电】辽南民主联军地方武装一部，已于日前将盘踞孤山县东北龙王庙骆驼峰一带的蒋胡匪完全扑灭，生俘百余，至此辽南新解放区内之蒋伪散匪，全告肃清。
    【新华社东北四日电】东北民主联军某部六连以新方式进行对解放战士的教育。当每次解放战士到来时，全连召开欢迎会，新老战士互相介绍历史。并在各班由正副班长及战斗组长等组成研究组，及时研究帮助解放战士的方法。连队及时表扬立功之解放战士启发他们的立功信心，动员全体参加立功运动。该连因此在短期内做到二十五个解放战士和老战士打成一片，战斗情绪极为旺盛，现正互相提出竞赛，争作人民功臣。
    【新华社东北三日电】东北日报顷以组织城市力量支援前线为题发表社论，号召发动东北解放区三分之一的城市人力物力，支援爱国自卫战争。社论指出：这次哈尔滨在半个月中完成了二千三百青年参军（内有半数以上为工人和贫农）三千民夫参战的计划，并正在发动各阶层人民于八月底完成二十万双胜利鞋而努力，这个事实说明动员城市人力物力支援爱国自卫战争，不但需要而且有充分的可能。因此不能借口城市与农村的不同而放松了城市支援前线的工作，应进一步强有力的组织城市人力与物力，积极长期的支援前线。首先在干部思想上扫除“和平建设”，强调困难的有苦观念，使城市中的一切工作均贯注于前线的胜利。社论并指出今后必须以工人贫农为主普遍深入发动街道斗争，消灭敌伪残余，摧毁封建势力，彻底打垮旧的政权机构，严厉取缔投机取巧，囤积居奇的不正当商人。大胆提拔运动中贫苦清白的工人贫民积极分子出来树立基本群众的优势，发动群众与支援前线相结合，这样才能打下长期支援爱国自卫战争的稳固基础。
