　　Dagong Freight Depot Announcement
    This depot was previously ordered to close down, but due to numerous procedures, it has not been able to finalize the closure earlier. We hereby announce again that all shops in various locations that have business dealings with this depot must bring their receipts for settlement before September 10th. Late submissions will be considered invalid, and we will not be able to process them. Your cooperation is appreciated.
