    Grasp Typical Cases, Establish Banners
    Cixian County's Second District Promotes Production and Savings
    [This newspaper's Cixian Dispatch] The Second District is a newly liberated area with no experience in mutual aid. The entire district also does not have significant drought or disaster damage because of the abundance of water. Therefore, it is difficult to promote production and savings. The leadership firmly grasped the establishment of mutual aid and savings as banners, thereby powerfully promoting the work of the entire district. Tao Hongfu, the director of the East Houzhao Military Management Committee, saved nine dou of grain in twenty days. His family of fourteen people originally ate wheat porridge for breakfast and dinner and white flour for lunch, consuming one dou of wheat per day. After the call for savings was issued, he was the first to respond, exchanging one shi of wheat for one shi and five dou of sorghum, and five dou of wheat for four dou of rice. They ate sorghum flour buns for breakfast and dinner, and rice for lunch, sometimes adding sorghum flour buns. They ate like this for twenty days and still had four dou of sorghum left. He used this specific figure to explain to the masses. The masses in the entire village immediately responded and exchanged food for savings. Tao Hongfu's model savings deeds were quickly promoted throughout the district. Du Runshen's mutual aid group in West Houzhao consisted of eleven households voluntarily joined together in early May. Mutual aid in farming saved a lot of labor and was very consolidated. Work points began to be used in early June. The reason why this group did not collapse was the establishment of an evaluation system. Work was evaluated every day during the afternoon breaks, so no one was taken advantage of. Furthermore, accounts were settled frequently. Accounts were settled in stages following the rise or fall of short-term labor prices, and quickly reconciled. Formal reviews were conducted every seven or eight days, and minor problems were corrected at any time. Surplus labor was used to work short-term jobs, earning one hundred and twenty jin of wheat. The spirit of serious evaluation, accounting, and review of this group was promoted throughout the district, promoting the development of mutual aid.

    抓住典型树立旗帜
    磁县二区推动生产节约
    【本报磁县讯】二区是新区，没有互助经验，全区又多水地灾荒不显著，生产节约很难推行。领导上抓紧树立了互助节约的旗帜，才有力的推动了全区的工作。东侯召武委会主任陶鸿伏二十天节约九斗粮，他全家共十四口，节约前每天早晚吃麦仁饭，晌午吃白面，一天吃一斗麦子。节约号召提出后，他首先响应，用一石麦子换了一石五斗高粱，用五斗麦子换了四斗米，早晚吃高粱面窝头，晌午吃米，有时加吃高粱面窝头，整吃了二十天，还余下四斗高粱。他拿这个具体的数字，向群众说明，全村群众立即响应，纷纷换饭节约。陶鸿伏的节约模范事迹，迅速推广到全区。西侯召杜润身互助组，五月初自愿结合的共十一户，互助作活省工很多又很巩固，六月初开始使用工票。这个组所以不垮台的原因是建立了评工制度，每天午后歇二歇时即行评工，这样互不吃亏。再就是算帐经常，跟着短工价钱的上升或下降，即行分段算帐，迅速找清。七八天就要正式检讨一次，将一些零碎毛病随时改正。余工打短工，赚了一百二十斤麦子。这组的评工算帐认真检讨的精神，推广到全区，推动了互助的发展。（二区通讯小组、王汇执笔）
