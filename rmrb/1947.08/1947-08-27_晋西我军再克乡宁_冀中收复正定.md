　　Xinhua News Agency, Jinji Luyu, 25th: Late news: Our army in western Shanxi re-recaptured the county seat of Xiangning on the 12th of this month. The 199th Regiment of the 67th Brigade of the 30th Division of the Chiang Kai-shek army that invaded from Jixian has been driven back to its original position.
　　Xinhua News Agency, Jinchaji, 25th Urgent Dispatch: At 4:00 PM on the 24th, a unit of the Jinchaji People's Liberation Army recovered Zhengding City, 30 miles northeast of Shijiazhuang. This city was captured by the Chiang Kai-shek army from Shimen on July 10th.
　　Xinhua News Agency, Jinchaji, 23rd: More than 2,000 emancipated peasants from Zhengding, Huolu, Jingxing, and other counties enthusiastically joined the People's Liberation Army. The peasants said one after another: "The Communist Party helped us vent our anger and emancipated us. We must defend the fruits of victory." After joining the army, the peasants of Zhandao Village, Huolu, swore to the whole village: "We will not go home until Chiang Kai-shek is defeated." In addition: The Jinchaji Field Army has seized extremely rich spoils in the various battles this summer, enough to equip several new army corps. The spoils seized by one army corps alone in April, May, and June are enough to equip ten modern infantry regiments. The weapons seized by this army corps include: rocket launchers, anti-tank guns, mountain guns, and other artillery pieces totaling 83, light artillery and grenade launchers 291, light and heavy machine guns 655, and more than 14,200 rifles.
　　Xinhua News Agency, Jinchaji, 24th: The artillery units of the Jinchaji People's Liberation Army have repeatedly performed meritorious service, and 310 artillery heroes have been rewarded at the military region's artillery commendation and celebration meeting. In the Cangxian battle last month, the 1st artillery company once covered the infantry's ascent to the city in the midst of a raging storm, hitting the target every time and completing the mission, earning them collective praise. Among the heroes are model companies who overcame transportation difficulties such as rugged mountain roads, rivers, and swamps, frequently transferred positions, and calmly responded to the battle; there are sharpshooters who destroyed five bunkers with six shells; there are ammunition handlers who carried heavy ammunition back and forth for 200 meters through enemy fire to complete ammunition transport; there are excellent grooms who take care of horses, diligently brush, feed, and water them; there are artillery observers who go deep into the forward positions with boldness and care; and there are cooks who ensure improved meals in the heat of battle. At the "August 1st" award ceremony, Chairman Pan of the Field Army Political Department gave a speech encouraging everyone to further build the Jinchaji People's Artillery.
