[Reported from Jinan, Hebei, on the 24th by this newspaper] Four hundred village cadres and activists from the third, fourth, and fifth districts of Qinghe were gathered for training to examine their class stance. The examination revealed three types of thinking: (1) fear of the "sky changing" (the Communists losing power) and therefore reluctance to struggle; (2) having feelings of pity for landlords; (3) deep-rooted clan concepts, making them embarrassed to struggle against landlords with the same surname. In × village in the third district, the mother and son of a landlord who was being struggled against sought help from Comrade ×, kneeling and crying. Comrade × felt that the landlord being struggled against was an elder of the same surname, and he couldn't bear the kneeling, felt bad for the mother and son, and promised to find a way to help them. Also, the village chief of × village was approached by two daughters of a landlord pleading, "Don't look at our father's face, but look at the faces of us sisters!" They also treated him to a meal. During the liquidation process, the masses demanded that the landlord compensate 100,000 yuan, but the village chief, feeling sympathetic, only made him pay 60,000 yuan. After repeated examination, they all deeply realized their past mistakes and wished they could return to the village immediately to settle accounts with the landlords. Comrade × said, "They never ate red sorghum when they were young. During the famine years, I asked my uncle to borrow ten jin of sorghum from the landlord's family, and they wouldn't lend it to us. Who ever felt sorry for us! This time, the struggle must be forceful and loud." They all said: All landlords are guilty, every landlord exploits, the poverty we suffered was all caused by the landlords, we must not forget the pain once the scars heal.

　　清河集训四百村干　端正立场准备复查
    【本报冀南二十四日电】清河集训三、四、五区四百名村干、积极分子，检查阶级立场。检查出三种思想：（一）怕变天不敢斗争；（二）对地主有怜悯心；（三）宗族观念深，对同姓地主不好意思斗。三区×村被斗地主母子，找×同志求情，磕头大哭；×同志觉得被斗地主是他同姓的长辈，磕头担不起，替他母子难过，也跑下哭了，答应给他们想办法。又×村村长曾有地主的两个女儿找他求情：“不看俺爷看俺姊妹俩的脸吧！”又陪着他吃了一次酒。在清算时，群众要求该地主赔偿十万元，村长看了情，只让拿了六万元。经翻覆检查，都痛悉前非，恨不得当时回村去向地主算帐。×同志说：“人家从小没吃过红高梁，灾荒年，我托俺叔跟地主家借十斤高粱，还不借给哩，谁替咱难受过！这次斗争，非打一下响一声不行。”都说：凡地主都有罪，那个地主也剥削，咱们受的穷罪，都是地主给的，咱们不能好了疮疤忘了痛。
