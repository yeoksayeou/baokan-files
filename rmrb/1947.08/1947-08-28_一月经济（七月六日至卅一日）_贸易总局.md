　　一、Market and Price Situation:

    Grain:

    In the past month, grain prices in the border region have generally been stable. However, due to rain shortages in Taihang and Taiyue, and because in mid-July, insect pests (locusts and other insect disasters) were discovered in some areas of Taihang, and there were hailstorms, grain prices rose sharply. In Jincheng, from July 10th to 25th, the price of millet rose from 65 yuan to 110 yuan per market catty. In Yangcheng, on July 24th, the price of millet rose from 2,100 yuan to 2,500 yuan per market dou. In Changzhi, from early to mid-July, the price of millet continued to rise from 81 yuan to 144 yuan per catty, once reaching over 170 yuan. By the end of the month, it had fallen back to 142 yuan per catty, thus affecting the rise in grain prices in Wu'an, Shexian, and other counties. In Shexian, on July 26th, the price of millet had risen to 155-165 yuan per market catty, and Yangyi in Wu'an had also risen to 165 yuan, with both places rising by 30-40 yuan. In Handan, due to the continued influx of grain from the east, prices remained stable, with millet around 140 yuan per catty, wheat 116-120 yuan, and corn 96-108 yuan. In Southern Hebei, due to uniform rainfall and the prospect of a good autumn harvest, grain prices were generally stable and weakening. In Linqing, after mid-July, the prices of various grains trended downward, with millet falling from 96 yuan to 76 yuan per catty, and wheat from 110 yuan to 90 yuan. Grain mostly flowed westward. In the Hebei-Henan area, from the wheat harvest until now, rice and miscellaneous grain prices have been stable, and wheat prices have been trending downward. In Puyang, from July 15th to 23rd, millet was around 2,000 yuan per dou, corn 1,300-1,400 yuan, and wheat fell from 2,300 yuan to 2,100-1,900 yuan. Various grains mostly flowed west and north. After mid-July, due to the influence of grain prices in the west, grain prices also showed a slight upward trend. On July 17th, the price of millet and wheat in Qingfeng was 2,250 yuan per dou, and in Nanle it was 2,500 yuan, with both places rising by 150-200 yuan. However, in the new Yellow River area of Juan, Yun, and other counties, due to the rapid restoration of markets and the perfection of unified currency work, prices were generally stable, with wheat at 60 yuan per catty and corn at 50 yuan. In Taihang and Taiyue, after the 25th, rain fell in various places, and grain prices began to trend downward.

    Grain prices in neighboring liberated areas around the border region generally did not fluctuate much due to uniform rainfall. In Dezhou, Shandong, prices were stable throughout the month. In early July, millet was 47 yuan per catty, wheat 38 yuan, and corn 30 yuan. In late July, millet was 47-50 yuan, wheat 42 yuan, and corn 29-33 yuan. However, in Central Hebei, due to enemy disturbances, grain prices first fell and then rose. In Hejian, in the first half of July, the price of millet fell from 1,150 yuan to 1,000 yuan per catty, and wheat from 1,150 yuan to 900 yuan. After the 20th, millet rose again to 1,200 yuan, and wheat to 1,250 yuan.

    Grain was basically lacking in the Kuomintang areas, and grain prices fluctuated from time to time. In Tianjin, in early July, rice once reached 7,000 yuan per catty, millet 3,600 yuan, wheat 3,500 yuan, and Shouting flour sacks 250,000 yuan. With the victory of our army's counter-offensive, the enemy and puppets in Tianjin and Beijing were extremely panicked, and prepared to flee, dumping heavy goods and buying valuables. Cloth and gold rose sharply, and grain prices weakened. In mid-July, millet in Tianjin was 3,450 yuan, rice 5,800 yuan, wheat 2,900 yuan, and Shouting flour 200,000 yuan.

    Cotton:

    In the past month, cotton prices in the border region generally rose due to eastward exports and salt exchange in Dezhou, with the western line showing a particularly large increase. In Linqing, the price rose from 580 yuan to 640 yuan. In Puyang, it rose from 650 yuan to over 700 yuan. The prices in Taihang and Taiyue on the western line were particularly high. In Jincheng, from July 15th to 25th, the price continued to rise from 750 yuan to 900 yuan per catty. In Changzhi, it rose from 650 yuan to 750 yuan. Jiyuan, as a cotton export area, had particularly high prices, once reaching 1,400 yuan per catty in early July. In late July, due to the cessation of exports, the price fell back to around 1,000 yuan. Due to the continuous transport of cotton from our area to friendly areas, cotton prices in various friendly liberated areas remained stable. In Dezhou, the price in July was 360-350 yuan. Because the cotton continued to flow into Southern Hebei, the price was stable. In Xinji, Central Hebei, the price was 4,300 yuan per catty in early July, falling to 3,500 yuan in mid-July, and 3,600 yuan in late July. However, in Hejian, due to enemy disturbances, the price was slightly higher, at 6,000 yuan in early July, rising to 6,100 yuan in mid-July. In Jinan, in the Kuomintang area, the enemy implemented a tight monetary policy from late June, and cotton air transport to Qingdao and Shanghai was once stopped, leading to weaker cotton prices, at 1.08 million yuan per 100 catties. As of July, the tight monetary policy continued, and cotton prices remained weak due to the tight money situation in Tianjin and Shanghai. On July 10th, the price was 1.08 million yuan in Jinan, 1.53 million yuan in Qingdao, and 1.46 million yuan in Tianjin.

    Homespun Cloth:

    Since the beginning of spring, prices have generally been stable. In early July, various places were busy with replanting, affecting the arrival of eastern cloth on the market, and the market was once quiet. After mid-July, the eastern cloth market gradually became active. On July 25th, goods from Guangping and Quzhou poured into Handan, and customers from Changzhi and Linxian in the west came to the market. The cloth market was active, and prices rose. Good cloth rose by 10 yuan to 260 yuan per foot, and general cloth was 220 yuan, with daily transactions of over 10,000 feet. Prices in the eastern cloth-producing areas also rose: in Guangping, high-quality cloth was 280 yuan, medium-quality 260 yuan, and low-quality 230 yuan, each foot rising by 20-30 yuan. In Quzhou, medium-quality cloth was 250 yuan, and in Feixiang 260 yuan. In Changzhi, from July 15th to 20th, cloth was selling quickly, with 20-30 bundles being sold each day, mostly to Jincheng, Yangcheng, Gaoping, and other places. Good cloth sold quickly at around 230 yuan per foot, while secondary cloth at 210-220 yuan was not in demand. In other places, prices also rose slightly due to the influence of rising cotton and grain prices, but the overall trend was still stable.

    Edible Salt:

    Salt prices fluctuated greatly in the past month. However, in the western line, due to the influence of grain prices and transportation issues, prices rose significantly in the mountainous areas of Shanxi and Henan: in Taiyue, Jincheng, Yangcheng, Gaoping, Jiyuan, and other counties, salt prices were all above 250 yuan. Prices also rose in the Taihang and Jinzhong areas. In late July, the price in Zuoquan rose to 230 yuan per catty, affecting the price in Yangyi, which also rose. On July 25th, the price rose from 155 yuan to 160-170 yuan per catty, mostly sold to Zuoquan. Changzhi was also very active, with the price at 196 yuan in the first half of July, rising to 200-210 yuan after the 25th. However, salt prices in the eastern line remained stable and even fell. In early July, in Linqing and Handan, the market was weak due to the fall in salt prices in Dezhou (from 50 yuan to 42 yuan). In Linqing, the price was 100-105 yuan per catty, and in Handan 148-145 yuan. After mid-July, activity gradually increased. In Linqing, on July 25th, the price of good quality goods rose from 105 yuan to 110 yuan per catty, and once reached 120 yuan on the 30th, selling quickly, with only over 70,000 catties being sold in a week. In Handan, due to the influx of goods from the east and the large number of customers from the western line, an average of over 7,000 catties were sold per day from the 20th to the 25th, an increase in sales volume compared to the past. Salt sales in various places were more active after the end of July than before.

    Foreign Goods:

    In the past month, due to the tense military situation and enemy panic, the prices of general merchandise in major cities rose, and the blockade intensified. It was difficult to transport goods in and out, and foreign goods were generally expensive, with sugar and alkali the most expensive, followed by pigments and paper. In July, the price of white sugar in Linqing rose by 650 yuan per catty, brown sugar by 500 yuan, alkali by 230 yuan, and Fenlian paper (ream) by 35,000 yuan. The price of matches was weak at the end of June and the beginning of July, at 48,000 yuan per basket. After July 11th, it rose to 50,000 yuan, and continued to rise to 51,000 yuan on the 27th. The prices of various foreign goods were high and selling quickly, with an average daily transaction value of over 10 million yuan. The prices of various foreign goods in Handan also rose: red and white sugar each rose by 500 yuan, alkali by 250 yuan, and Fenlian paper by 1,500 yuan. Pigments also showed an upward trend: Daqing rose by 160 yuan per bag, and black indigo powder rose by 500 yuan per catty. In Tianjin, in the Kuomintang area, the prices of paper and pigments rose in July, with Fenlian paper at 190,000 yuan, up 55,000 yuan, and the newspaper of this factory at 300,000 yuan, up 22,000 yuan. B-character blue (large bucket) was 6 million yuan, up 800,000 yuan. Therefore, the prices of foreign goods in this area were affected and rose. At the end of July, the prices of various foreign goods still did not show any signs of falling.

    　　　　二、Financial Situation:

    Exchange Rate:

    The exchange rate generally fell. In Nangong, it fell from 90% to 70%, in Linqing from 95% to 72%, and in Jiyuan from 1175 to 1000 yuan. The reasons for this were: the devaluation of Kuomintang currency, the rise in gold prices and commodity prices, and the large export volume and high prices of cotton in our area. In mid-July, our army's victorious counter-offensive in the Hebei-Shandong-Henan area quickly occupied the market in the newly liberated areas and drove Kuomintang currency to the black market. In Juan, Yun, and other counties, the exchange rate of Kuomintang currency had reached 25:1 to 30:1 by mid-July. In the newly recovered areas of Southern Shanxi, such as Quwo, Wenxi, Xiaxian, and Jiangxian, Kuomintang currency had completely entered the underground market, and its exchange rate was also declining day by day. The masses competed to use Kuomintang currency below 500 yuan to make fans.

    Gold and Silver Prices:

    The gold price in the entire area showed an upward trend due to the influence of the Kuomintang area. In early July, it once reached 180,000 yuan in Linqing (later falling to 165,000 yuan), 135,000 yuan in Handan, up 25,000 yuan compared to June, 125,000 yuan in Xingtai, up 15,000 yuan, and 130,000 yuan in Baobi, up 10,000 yuan. In late July, the price in Xingtai rose to 140,000 yuan, while the price in Handan remained at 135,000 yuan, and the price in Xinjiang was 135,000 yuan. The price of silver dollars in the Taiyue area turned high due to the influence of Luoyang, with 1,700-2,000 yuan in Jiyuan and 2,000 yuan in Xinjiang.

    Exchange Rate between Various Currencies Inside and Outside the Area: Ratio of local currency to border region currency - 1:8.6 in Xinji and 1:9 in Hejian in early July. In mid-July, both places were 1:7.5. Ratio of local currency to Beihai notes - 2.2:1 in Zhou in early July, and 2.1:1 in late July.

　　一月经济
    （七月六日至卅一日）
  　贸易总局
    　　　　一、商情物价：
    粮食：
    月来边区粮价一般平稳，惟太行、太岳雨缺，并因七月中，太行部分地区发现虫害（蝗蝻及其他虫灾）和遭雹击，致粮价猛涨：晋城七月十日至二十五日小米每市斤由六五元升到一一○元。阳城二十四日小米每市斗由二一○○元，升到二五○○元。长治七月上旬到中旬小米由八一元续升为一四四元，一度涨到一七○余元，月终回跌每斤则为一四二元，故影响武、涉等县粮亦上升。涉县二十六日小米每市斤已涨到一五五——一六五元，武安阳邑亦涨一六五元，两地各升三四十元。邯郸因东粮续进，价持平，小米每斤一四○元左右，麦子一一六——一二○元，玉茭九六——一○八元。冀南因雨量均匀，秋禾有望，粮价一般平稳下疲。临清中旬以后，各粮趋下，小米每斤由九六元，降至七六元，麦子由一一○元，降至九○元，粮食多向西流。冀豫从麦收迄今，米杂价平，小麦下趋。濮阳七月十五日至二十三日小米每斗二○○○元左右，玉茭一千三四百元，小麦由二三○○元降为二一○○——一九○○元，各粮多向西、北流。中旬后，因受西面粮价影响，粮价亦有抬头。十七日清丰米麦每斗均为二二五○元，南乐米麦均为二五○○元，两地各上升一五○——二○○元。但黄河南新区鄄、郓等县，因集市恢复迅速，统一货币工作完善，物价均逞平稳，小麦每斤六○元，玉茭五○元。太行、太岳，二十五日后，各地先后落雨，粮价开始下游。
    边区周围友邻解放区粮价，因雨水均匀，一般波动不大。山东德州全月逞平，七月上旬小米每斤四七元，小麦三八元、玉茭三○元；下旬小米四七元——五○元，小麦四二元，玉茭二九——三三元，惟冀中因受敌出扰影响，粮价先降后升。河涧七月上半月前小米每斤由一一五○元，降到一○○○元，小麦一一五○元，降为九○○元；二十日以后小米复升为一二○○元，小麦一二五○元。
    蒋区粮食基本缺乏，粮价时有波动。天津七月初大米曾达七○○○元一斤，小米三六○○元，小麦三五○○元，寿通粉袋二十五万元，我军胜利反攻，平津敌伪异常恐慌，纷纷准备潜逃，抛售笨重，收买细软，布匹黄金大涨，粮价逞疲，七月中旬，天津小米三四五○元，大米五八○○元，小麦二九○○元，寿通粉二十万元。
    棉花：
    月来边区棉花因东运出口及德州换盐，棉价一般上升，西线涨率尤大。临清由五八○元升到六四○元。濮阳由六五○元升到七○○元以上。西线太行、太岳价尤高。晋城七月十五日至二十五日每斤由七五○元续升到九○○元。长治由六五○元升到七五○元。济源因系棉花出口地，价特高，七月上旬每斤曾达一四○○元，下旬因停止出境，价回跌为一○○○元左右。由于我区棉花陆续输往友区，致各友邻解放区棉价均持平稳，德州七月价三六○元——三五○元。因冀南棉续进价稳，冀中辛集七月上旬每斤四三○○元，中旬下降为三五○○元，下旬三六○○元，惟河涧因受敌扰，价稍高，上旬六○○○元，月中升为六一○○元。蒋区济南从六月下旬起敌行紧缩通货，并一度棉停止空运青沪，棉价逞疲，每百斤为一○八万元，及至七月继之紧缩通货，并受津沪银根吃紧的影响，棉价仍逞平状，七月十日济南一○八万元，青岛一五三万元，天津一四六万元。
    土布：
    自入春迄今，惯持平稳，七月上旬，各地忙于抢种补种，影响东布上市少，市场一度沉静。中旬以后，东线布市渐形活跃，邯郸二十五日广平、曲周来货涌，西路长（治）林（县）等地顾客上市，布市活跃，价提，好布每尺二六○元，上升一○元，一般二二○元，日成交万余尺。东面产布区价亦提：广平上等布二八○元，中等二六○元，次二三○元，每尺上升二○——三○元，曲周中等布二五○元，肥乡二六○元，快。长治七月十五日至二十日，布快，每日成交二三十捆，多销晋（城）阳（城）高（平）等地，好布每尺二三○元上下快，次布二百一、二无人问津。其他各地，因受棉粮价涨影响，价亦稍提，但仍是平稳之势。
    食盐：
    月来盐大涨跌，惟西线因受粮价影响和运输关系，晋豫山岳地带大显抬头：太岳晋（城）阳（城）高（平）济（源）等县，盐价均在二五○元以上，太行晋中一带价亦涨，七月下旬左权价涨每斤二三○元，影响阳邑价亦抬头，二十五日每斤由一五五元上升到一六○元——一七○元，多销左权。长治亦很活动，七月上半月一九六元，二十五日后，即升为二○○——二一○元。但东线盐价仍持平且跌，七月上旬临（清）邯（郸）因德州盐价落（由五○元跌到四二元），行情逞疲不快。临清每斤一○○元——一○五元，邯郸一四八——一四五元，中旬以后渐形活动。临清二十五日好货每斤由一○五元提到一一○，三十日曾达一二○元尚快，计一周只成交七万余斤。邯郸因东面来货涌西线顾客亦伙，二十日至二十五日每日平均成交七千余斤，成交量较前增多。各地食盐从七月终以后较前活动。
    外货：
    月来因军事吃紧，敌人恐慌，各大城市杂货提价，并封锁加剧。运货出入困难，外货价一般昂，糖类、硷面为最，颜料、纸张次之，七月份临清白糖每斤上升六五○元，红糖上升五○○元，硷面上升二三○元，粉连纸（令）三五○○○元快，火柴在六月终七月初价显疲，每篓四八○○○元，七月十一日后升为五○○○○元，二十七日续升为五一○○○元，各外货价昂且快。每日平均成交总值达千余万元。邯郸各外货亦上升：红白糖各上升五○○元，硷面上升二五○元，粉连纸上升一五○○元；颜料亦显抬头：黛青每袋上升一六○元，黑靛粉每斤上升五○○元。蒋区天津七月来纸张、颜料上涨，粉连一九○○○○元，上升五五○○○元，本厂报纸三○万元，上升二万二千元，Ｂ字青（大桶）六○○万元，上升八○万元。故影响本区外货上升。七月底各外货仍不见回头。
    　　　　二、金融情况：
    汇价：
    普遍下跌，南宫由九分跌到七分，临清九分五压跌到七分二厘，济源一一七五，跌到一○○○元。原因：蒋币贬价，金价物价上涨，另外我区棉花出口量大且价高等所致。月中冀鲁豫我军胜利反攻，在新光复区，迅速占领市场，驱蒋币于黑市，鄄郓等县七月中旬蒋钞已到二五比一——三○比一，晋南新收复区，曲（沃）闻（喜）夏（县）绛（县）等地，蒋币已全转入地下，其比值亦日益下降。群众争用五百元以下蒋币糊扇子。
    金银价：
    全区金价因受蒋区影响，逞上升趋势：七月上旬临清曾达十八万元（后跌为一六五○○○元），邯郸一三五○○○元，较之六月份上升二五○○○元，邢台一二五○○○元，上升一五○○○元，薄壁一三○○○○元上升一○○○○元，下旬邢台升到一四○○○○元，邯郸仍在一三五○○○元，新绛一三五○○○元，银元在太岳方面，因受洛阳影响价转高，济源一七○○元——二○○○元，新绛二○○○元。
    区内外各种货币比值：本币与边币——上旬辛集一比八·六·河涧一比九，中旬二地均系一比七·五。本币与北海票比值——上旬州二·二比一，下旬二·一比一。
