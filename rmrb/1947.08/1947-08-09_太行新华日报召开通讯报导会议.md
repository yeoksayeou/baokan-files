    Taihang Xinhua Daily
    Holds Correspondence and Reporting Conference
    [This newspaper, Taihang News] The correspondence and reporting conference convened by the Taihang Xinhua Daily and Xinhua Branch has now victoriously opened after more than a month of preparation. Forty-three representatives from various special districts and counties attended, including Zhu Ting, Sun Chengwen, and Liu Yinlong. Huo Fan, a comrade from the Propaganda Department of the Taihang District Party Committee, as well as representatives from the Taihang Federation of Literary and Art Circles and the Armed Forces Committee also participated. Comrade Shi Jiyan first reported on the significance and methods of the meeting, saying: "In the past year, the correspondence and reporting work in the Taihang District has greatly developed, not only supporting the Xinhua Daily, but also providing materials for the People's Daily and many publications in this district and border area. The main purpose of this meeting is to summarize and exchange experiences from various places. Regarding the meeting methods, he pointed out that we must adhere to the principle of 'from the masses, to the masses, concentrate it, and implement it.' First, hold zonal group discussions, and then hold plenary meetings for typical speeches. Comrades from the newspaper office, in addition to adhering to their work, will fully participate in the groups to jointly study." Comrade Huo Fan said in his speech: "Today, the correspondence and reporting work in the Taihang District includes not only the newspaper office and correspondents, but also the Party's Propaganda Department, and local small newspapers and offices. Most of the comrades who have come are comrades from the Party's propaganda departments in various places, so if this meeting is successful, it will be equivalent to doing a good job in the Party's propaganda work." He also said: "The Second Cultural and Educational Congress was originally scheduled to be held in November this year, but due to the famine, it was decided to convene it by category. This correspondence and reporting conference is also part of the Second Cultural and Educational Congress." Representatives from various zones spoke in succession. Dong Ke, the Minister of Propaganda of the Xingtai Workers' Union, said: "At present, there is an urgent need to understand how to write articles well and do a good job in correspondence and reporting. I want to seek a thorough solution at the conference." Liu Yinlong, from the Second District Party Committee Office, said: "In addition to exchanging rough and piecemeal experiences, we must honestly learn from the experiences of various places and summarize our work." On the 3rd and 4th, the Xinhua Daily and representatives from various zones exchanged opinions on the editing and correspondence of the Xinhua Daily. Starting on the 5th, the three major planned issues will be formally discussed: how to strengthen correspondence work, how to run small newspapers well, and how to report on central tasks.
