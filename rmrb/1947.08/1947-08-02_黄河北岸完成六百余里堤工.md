Xinhua News Agency, Jinji Luyu, 31st: The 600-plus li of dike on the north bank of the Yellow River, stretching from Dacheji in Changyuan to the area between Shuiniu and Zhaozhuang in Qiyu (a newly established county comprising parts of Qihe and Yucheng counties), were completed on the 23rd. The scale of mobilization, the grandness of the project, and the speed of completion were unprecedented. After the wheat harvest, in addition to the counties along the river, a force of 80,000 farmers from non-riverside counties like Yanggu, ChiPing, Boping and Liaocheng rushed to help with the repairs. Shou Zhang county, because it started construction later, mobilized all 300,000 farmers to rush to repair the dikes.

In the process of dike construction, many moving deeds emerged. Farmers from various counties voluntarily contributed stones, boats, grain, and wages. ＠Shan County alone donated 15,000 cubic meters of stones (5,000 catties per cubic meter), exceeding the pre-determined plan by three times. Zhongshan Village and other villages in the county also donated more than 400 boats, forming a large boat transportation team, with each boat being equivalent to three large carts, saving more than 26 million yuan in transportation costs. Farmers in Kunwu County donated wage grain equivalent to 60,000 cubic meters of earth. Liaocheng donated wage grain of more than 341,100 catties.

Under the call for self-help and saving others, every farmer demonstrated high levels of enthusiasm. Gao Facheng, Gao Fenghe, and Gao Fengxiang, farmers from Liaocheng, built 42 cubic meters of earth in one day, averaging 14 cubic meters per person, while the general estimate was only a little over 1 cubic meter per worker. Many women heroes emerged among the large number of dike-repairing heroes. Luan Shirong, director of the Women's Association in Yangwu District, pushed more earth than men. She said, "If we don't repair it well, the eight acres of land we just received will be flooded by the disaster sent by Chiang Kai-shek before we even see any grain. Wouldn't that mean our liberation was in vain?" Dong Fenxing, who had been liberated, was originally assigned to help in the kitchen, but she insisted on going to the dike to push earth.

Babaiyujiaji Village in Changyuan, which had been awarded the title of model village for dike repair twice, was raided by Chiang Kai-shek's troops on June 12th, killing and wounding more than 30 villagers who were actively repairing the dikes, and threatening them not to go to repair the dikes again. During this emergency repair, all the young and middle-aged people in the village participated even more bravely, with many wearing mourning clothes. They said: "Repairing the dikes is to save ourselves, and it is also like fighting against Old Chiang, and avenging our parents!" Farmers in the village pushed 427 cubic meters of earth in eight days.

With such enthusiasm from the masses, various counties completed their tasks ahead of schedule. Kunwu, Jinyang, Changyuan and other counties under the Second Repair and Defense Command completed ten days' worth of work in four days. The Fourth Repair and Defense Command completed 860,000 cubic meters of earthwork in ten days.

    黄河北岸完成六百余里堤工
    【新华社晋冀鲁豫三十一日电】黄河北岸自长垣大车集至齐禹（新设县，包括齐河、禹城两县各一部）水牛、赵庄长达六百余里大堤，已于二十三日先后完工。此次动员力量之大，规模之宏，进行之速，实属空前。麦收后，除沿河各县外，非沿河县，仅阳谷、茬平、博平、聊城等四县赶往抢修的农民即达八万人。寿张县因动工较迟，全县三十万农民总动员抢修。在修堤中，出现了许多可歌可泣的事迹，各县农民，自动献石、献船、献粮、献工资。＠山县即献石一万五千方（每方五千斤），超过预订计划三倍。该县中山庄等村，并献船四百多艘，组成船运大队，每船可顶三辆大车，节省运费二千六百余万元。昆吾县农民献出六万方土的工资粮。聊城献工资米三十四万一千一百余斤。在救人自救之下每个农民，都发挥高度的积极性。聊城农民高法成、高凤和、高凤祥三人，一天筑土四十二方，每人合十四方，而按一般估计每工只能筑土一方多。在大批复堤英雄中并出现许多的妇女英雄。仅阳五区妇会主任栾世荣，推土比男人还多。她说：“要不好好修，刚分到的八亩地没见粮食，再被蒋介石发来的祸水淹了，岂不是白翻了身。”翻了身的董分星，原分配她帮助伙房，但她非上堤推土不行。曾二次被奖为修堤模范村的长垣八百余家集村，六月十二日，蒋军特窜至该村，杀伤积极修堤之村民三十余人，威吓他们不许再去修堤。此次抢修中，该村全部青壮年，反更加奋勇参加，不少人身着孝服，他们说：“修堤为了救自己，也等于打老蒋，替爹娘报仇！”该村农民在八天中，推土达四百二十七公方。在群众这种热情下，各县均提前完成任务，二修防处的昆吾、仅阳、长垣等县，四天完成了十天的工程。四修防处，十天完成了八十六万方土。
