[Our newspaper's Taiyue dispatch of the 12th] In Changzi County, all 289 administrative villages are completely self-sufficient in village public grain and expenses. The 571 village cadres who are detached or semi-detached from production will save 4.5 dou of millet per person per month starting from April, which will amount to 2,080 shi and 8 dou of millet by the end of the year. Each village will save 2 dou of millet per month in office expenses, which will amount to 366 shi and 8 dou of millet from July to the end of the year. The source of village public grain is that village cadres participate in household production to achieve self-sufficiency. The sources of village public funds vary: some villages invest in cooperatives, some engage in agricultural production, some engage in transportation or draw people to help with busy work, and spend from the millet they earn. Now everyone is determined to compete in "serving the people and making contributions" to improve work efficiency.

[Our newspaper's report] At the district chief's financial and grain assistant meeting in Anze in March, research was conducted on village financial self-sufficiency through production. First, financial expenses and village allowances were stopped from April. The county's 93 administrative villages can save more than 500 shi of expenses in nine months, which will be self-sufficient through production in each village. Wang Village and Fansai in the Eighth District, and Jiasai and Beisanjiao in the Second District, have all achieved village financial self-sufficiency through production and no longer apportioning to the masses. Nankongtan, Langsai, and Tang Village in the Ninth District, and Baicun and Sima in the Eleventh District are also beginning to implement village financial self-sufficiency, determined to achieve no apportionment to the masses. Their methods and achievements are as follows: 1. Doing it yourself, combining agriculture and sideline occupations, such as the village chief, financial and grain secretary, and traffic officer of Wang Village in the Eighth District. They borrowed 3.5 shi of wheat and 4 shi of millet from the village grain collection as a production fund, raised a sow and two fat pigs, and also invested 20,000 yuan in the village cooperative fund. The two fat pigs sold for at least 11.2 shi of millet, the sow gave birth to four piglets which sold for 3.2 shi of millet, the cooperative can distribute 20,000 yuan in dividends, each person also raised four chickens to solve the problem of edible salt, and sometimes participated in mutual aid group work, selling work points earned to buy beans and extract oil to solve the problem of eating oil and lighting lamps. In the spring, more than four mu of wasteland were opened up, planted with four mu of potatoes and half a mu of radishes. The produced vegetables not only supply the whole year's consumption but can also grow more than 1,000 jin. The total money earned, in addition to village office expenses and living needs, still leaves 2 shi of millet, a sow, and more than 1,000 jin of vegetables. 2. Fixed personnel, carrying and transporting, such as the Jiasai Village Office in the Second District, which fixed a traffic officer to carry and transport. Now, in less than a month, they have earned 20,000 yuan, which can produce 3.5 shi of millet, which can solve the village office's three-month self-sufficiency problem. They also decided that the village chief, secretary, and traffic officer should participate in carrying and transporting under the principle of not hindering work. 3. Investing in workshop production: For example, Sima Village in the Eleventh District, put the more than 1 shi of millet left over from last year's opera performance and the more than 20,000 yuan saved this year from making military shoes (the money saved from unified buying, dyeing, cutting, and making) into the village cooperative. The village office's expenses and allowances are supplied by the cooperative every month, and the money earned is distributed according to the share. These all show that the method of village financial self-sufficiency through production is completely feasible. As long as the cadres' thinking is straightened out and they take action, it is easy to solve the problem of self-sufficiency. (Anze Mass Newspaper)

  　村干生产节约
  　努力村款自给
    【本报太岳十二日电】长子全县二百八十九个行政村，村公粮与经费完全自给。五百七十一个脱离生产及半脱离生产的村干部，自四月份起每人每月节约小米四斗半，至年底即可节约米二千零八十石八斗，办公费每个村每月节约二斗米，自七月份至年底，共可节约小米三百六十六石八斗。村公粮来源是，村干部参加家庭生产，求得自给。村公费来源各有不同，有的村投资合作社，有的经营农业生产，有的闹运输或抽人打忙工，从赚下的小米中开支。现大家都下决心，竞赛“为民立功”，来提高工作效率。
    【本报讯】安泽在三月份的区长财粮助理员会议上，就进行了村款生产自给的研究，首先从四月份停发财经费及村给养，全县九十三个行政村，九个月即能节约开支五百多石，都由各村生产自给。八区的王村、范赛，二区的贾赛、北三教都已做到了村款生产自给、不再向群众摊派。九区的南孔滩、郎赛、唐村，十一区的白村、司马也正在开始实行村款生产自给，决心达到不向群众摊派。其办法及成绩是这样的：一、亲自动手，农副业结合，如八区王村村长财粮书记交通员，他们从村筹粮内借了三石五斗麦、四石米，作为生产基金，喂了一口母猪，两口肥猪，又入到村合作社基金二万元，两口肥猪最少卖十一石二斗小米，母猪下四个猪娃卖三石二斗小米，合作社能分两万元红利，每个人又喂了四只鸡，解决食盐问题，有时参加互助组工作，赚下的工票，卖豆子熬油解决吃油点灯，春天开了四亩多荒地，种了四亩山药蛋，半亩萝卜，所产的菜除供全年食用，还能长一千多斤，总共赚下的钱除村公所开支与生活所需外；还剩小米两石、母猪一口、蔬菜一千多斤。二、固定人员，担挑运输，如二区贾赛村公所，固定一个交通员，担挑运输，现在不到一个月的时间，赚下二万元能产三石五斗小米，能解决村公所三个月自给问题，他们并决定村长、书记、交通员要在不妨碍工作的原则下，参加担挑运输。三、投资作坊生产：如十一区的司马村，把去年唱戏剩下的一石多小米与今年作军鞋省下的二万多元（因统一买、染、裁、做省下的钱），都入到本村合作社，村公所的经费与给养每月由合作社负责供给，赚下钱按本分红。这些都说明村款生产自给的办法，是完全可以行通的，只要干部思想打通，行动起来，是很容易解决自给问题的。（安泽群众报）
