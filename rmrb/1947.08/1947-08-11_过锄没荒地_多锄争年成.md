　　Diligently Weed Without Leaving Any Field Untouched;
  　More Weeding Will Guarantee a Good Harvest
    [This Newspaper's Report] In Shahe County, the men and women of Xincheng, Xinzhang and other villages are working together, competing to rush to weed the seedlings. At a meeting of cadres in Xincheng Village, after discussing plowing wasteland to plant buckwheat, they also discussed mutual aid in weeding the seedlings. They unanimously agreed that the first weeding determines the year's harvest. Diligently weed without leaving any field untouched. Liu Youzhang said: In the past, landlords hired twenty or thirty short-term workers and told everyone to work hard. If the sun tilted its head a little, they would weed several more mu. Now, our mutual aid in weeding is to save labor and do more work for ourselves. The next day, in addition to two head of cattle plowing the fields in his group, ten full laborers helped each other, weeding 30 mu of seedlings in one day. To save time, they collected the meals and sent them to the fields. Liu Jizong's group proposed to complete the first weeding in four days, starting with the low-lying areas, to prevent the land from being too wet to weed if it rained again. The woman Yao Bianni carried food for eleven people to the field. Lao Zhenni, the director of the women's association in the north street, led four women to the field to weed. The whole village agreed: "Weeding during a drought is as good as fertilizer." The mood was very high.
    At a mass meeting in Xinzhang Village, a call was made to weed the seedlings, proposing: "Everyone should make contributions, and mutual aid should win the big flag." After deliberation, each mutual aid group responded to the call, proposing that no group should have idle people and everyone should make contributions. The fourteenth group of men and women were very motivated and set a plan. The men weeded the whole ridges, and the elderly woman group leader, Wei, set a plan: the women would weed the mung beans and corn. Lao Jinni said: "This year, our women will replace short-term labor in weeding. We must make a contribution!" Each group selected one instructor to manage the time, and the militiamen were responsible for ringing the bell as a signal. Before dawn, the men and women of each group went to the fields, launching a hot and enthusiastic campaign of rushing to weed and make contributions, competing to win the big flag and become the top performers.
    Hao Fuyuan, the leader of the seventh mutual aid group in Donghaozhuang, and his group members discussed rushing to weed the seedlings. His group still had 55 mu of seedlings that had not been weeded, and six laborers had to finish it quickly. They also studied how to weed labor-savingly. Everyone said that mutual aid made them laugh and talk, and they did not feel tired. They could also weed more land. Land would not deceive people, but people could deceive the land. The more they worked, the more motivated they became. After discussion, all six laborers went to the field and finished weeding the 55 mu of seedlings in five days. Li Zuni, the women's captain of Northwest Liu, organized three women from her group to weed the fields, weeding two mu of corn, three mu of mung beans, and half a mu of yams in one and a half days. The first day she weeded and told everyone about it. The next day, eighty-nine women went to the fields to weed, weeding sixty-two mu in one day. Everyone said that if both men and women went to the fields like this, they would finish weeding in five days. Lin Zhangshi, who was sixty years old, also weeded two mu. The women's spinning group in Xixuzhuang discussed helping the men weed the seedlings. Some said: "I can't tell the difference between seedlings and weeds." Others said: "There is no work we can't do. We will weed the mung beans first and then learn to weed the millet." So, Ren Qin led five women from her group to weed five mu of mung beans in the field for half a day. While weeding, she said to the women: "We spin cotton to earn rice, and weeding means fewer people have to go out to get rice. This will enable us to overcome the disaster."
