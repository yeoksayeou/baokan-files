Weixian Ganji Town
Mutual Aid to Rush-Hoe Seedlings

[Our newspaper's telegram from Southern Hebei on the 1st] In Ganji Town, Weixian County, mutual aid is being used to rush-hoe seedlings. Early seedlings have been hoed three times, and late seedlings have also been hoed twice. First, all members of the farmers' association were divided into six squads, led by labor hero Zhang Dongting, to hoe the 325 mu of seedlings that the farmers' association had not yet distributed in a single day. Then, the groups competed to hoe their own land. In three days, 40 qing of autumn seedlings were hoed once. Currently, the millet, cotton, and sorghum have been hoed and weeded four times, and the late seedlings have been hoed twice. Wang Guangqun's group of 18 people selected a leader, a supervisor, and an inspector. They divided the land into shifts based on acreage and calculated work points by the day, with one day's work earning one work point, and one work point being worth two jin of rice. On rainy days, if they could do one-third of the work, it would count as one day's work point. The entire group has hoed and weeded seven times. Li Ersao's women's group of six people has hoed their 48.5 mu of autumn seedlings three times. Everyone feels the benefits of mutual aid in weeding. Wang Guangqun had a long strip of land. In the past, he could only hoe it once per day by himself. With mutual aid, each person hoes it one and a half times per day. The group of 18 estimates that they can spare six people to do side jobs in Handan. Guo Hecai implemented mutual aid, and the group encountered three difficulties: 1. The masses were perfunctory and did not hoe well with others. 2. Everyone wanted to hoe their own land first. 3. People wanted to be provided with meals instead of being paid with rice. After discussion, the masses decided to democratically assess work points for those who were active and those who did not work hard, increasing or decreasing their points accordingly. Everyone decided who to hoe for first through public consultation. Families participating in mutual aid that did not have women could have their meals provided by the landowner, and the cost would be deducted from their rice later. Work tickets were used to calculate work points, with each full work point worth ten fen, equivalent to four jin of rice. Each day was divided into five short work periods, with each period worth two fen of work. As a result, all eight groups in the village resolved their ideological issues and challenged each other to weed. In a blitz of eight days and fourteen work periods, all the fields were weeded. Each person hoed an average of 1.7 mu per day. Normally, each person could only hoe 1.3 mu, which would take twelve days to complete. The masses said, "If we didn't have mutual aid this year, let alone finish hoeing the seedlings, we wouldn't even be able to plant the land. From now on, mutual aid cannot be broken up even with a stick."

    威县干集镇
    互助赶工锄苗
    【本报冀南一日电】威县干集镇，互助锄苗，早苗锄三遍，晚苗亦锄过两遍。首先全体农会员分六个中队，由劳英张洞庭率领，将农会未分下去的三百廿五亩苗突击一晌锄完后，各组锄自己的地展开竞赛，三天将四十顷秋苗锄了一遍，目前谷、棉、高粱已锄耘达四遍，晚苗锄达二遍。王光群组十八人，选出带领人、督促人、检查人，按地亩分班，按晌计工，一晌一个工，一工顶二斤米，下雨天一天中能做三分之一的活即算一晌为一工，全组已锄耘七遍。李二嫂的六个人的妇女组，四十八亩半秋苗已锄过三遍，互助锄草都感到好处。王光群一块长地，过去自己锄，每晌只锄一遭，互助中每人锄一遭半，该组十八人，他们估计可省出六个人，做副业跑邯郸。郭河才实行互助，该组发生三个困难：一、群众应付，与别人锄不好。二、都愿先锄自己的。三、愿叫人管饭，不愿叫人拿米包干。经群众讨论规定，积极的和不好好干的，民主评定增减工分。先锄谁的大家公决，参加互助家无妇女的可以由地户管饭，将来扣米。使用工票计工，每整工顶十分折米四斤，每天为五个小晌，每晌计二分工。于是全村八组都打通思想，锄草互相挑战，八天突击，十四晌全锄完，每人平均一天锄一亩七分。平时每人只能锄一亩三分，得十二天完成。群众说：“今年不互助，别说苗锄不完，地也种不上，以后互助，棍也打不散了”。
