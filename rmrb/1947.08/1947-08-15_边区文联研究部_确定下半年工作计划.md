　　Border Region Literary Association Research Department
  　Defines Second Half of Year Work Plan
　　Following a half-month of land reform study and ideological rectification, the Border Region Literary Association Research Department conducted a detailed discussion on departmental work. It was decided that, based on the current manpower, work would begin by strengthening communication and liaison, and discovering and cultivating typical examples, proceeding step by step. A six-month work plan was formulated according to the seasonality of mass cultural activities, spanning from mid-August to the end of the Spring Festival next year. The main tasks are as follows:

　　1. Strengthen communication and liaison, establish a communication foundation, and organize mass-based investigations and research through communication and liaison. Collect materials on the development history, typical experiences, and current situation of the mass cultural movement in the Border Region, and establish a resource room. Good materials and research results will be compiled, printed, and published whenever possible. In addition, collections of mass dramas, songs, rhythmic stories, and ballad singing will be compiled, accompanied by short articles introducing typical examples and work experiences, to create an irregular publication to promote the mass cultural movement.

　　2. From the existing six members, cadres will be regularly rotated to go to the countryside to directly conduct investigations and research on mass dramas, music, propaganda mobilization, mass blackboards, radio stations…and other mass cultural and related cultural activities. However, due to the vastness of the region and the limited manpower of the organization, this type of investigation and research can only focus on typical examples, with general situation understanding conducted incidentally. The first group of comrades to go to the countryside has been decided as comrades Lin Mo, Lu Dian, Lu Chen, and Jia Han.

　　In addition, during this discussion of departmental work, as a result of the land reform study, all comrades further examined the past erroneous view of only focusing on individual creation and neglecting the investigation and research of mass budding-stage art. Investigation and research were not regarded as their basic work, but simply as a work task. Once the task was completed, they buried themselves in their own creations, and rarely continued to study the current situation of the movement or conduct theoretical learning on related issues. Experience has proven that only by laying down the burden and learning from mass art can one transform one's own artistic views and improve one's professional skills. Only this kind of integration can solve the contradiction between investigation and research and creation ideologically, and this integration is entirely possible. Comrades in the research department themselves have had this kind of experience in their work to varying degrees.

　　Secondly, everyone felt that the reason why today's mass cultural movement in the Border Region has such brilliant achievements is mainly the result of the joint efforts of the masses, folk artists, cultural and educational workers in counties, districts, and villages, and other working cadres throughout the region. Professional art workers (whether doing creative work or movement work) must unite with them, learn from them, and absorb their experience in joint work, overcome their own impractical style and urban perspectives, so as to better carry out the mass cultural movement.

　　After the above review, all comrades believe that in the future, political and ideological learning must be strengthened, the mass perspective must be strengthened, the mass line must be learned, ideological shortcomings must be actively corrected, the work of the research department must be done well, and the six-month work plan must be realized. The comrades going to the countryside also proposed that, during the investigation and research period, in addition to writing articles for "Literary Communications" and representing the research department in contacting various parties, they would also write communications about the work situation in other aspects of the work area at any time and send them to the party newspaper, so as to strengthen their writing ability.

　　Currently, comrades Lin Mo and others are undergoing a short-term study of the mass cultural movement, and they will be able to go to the countryside to start work soon. The comrades remaining at home have also begun to rectify the communication and liaison and resource room. We hope that the propaganda and education departments and art organizations in various places will contact us from now on, provide assistance, and work together to further develop the mass cultural movement in the Border Region!

### 边区文联研究部　确定下半年工作计划

　　边区文联研究部
  　确定下半年工作计划
    边区文联研究部继半月土地改革学习，整顿思想之后，对部门工作复进行了详细的研讨。决定根据现有人力，从加强通联，发现与培养典型的点滴工作做起，按群众文艺活动的季节性，订出半年工作计划。时间自八月中旬至明年春节结束时止。主要工作如下：
    一。加强通信联络，建立通联基础，通过通联组织群众性的调查研究。搜集边区群众文艺运动的发展历史，典型经验与现状的资料，成立资料室。好的资料及研究的结果，尽可能编印出版。并汇集群众戏剧、歌曲、快板、鼓词等创作，配以典型介绍，工作经验之短文，创刊一不定期刊物，以开展群众文艺运动。
    二。从现有六人中，经常轮流抽调干部下乡，直接进行群众戏剧、音乐、宣传鼓动，大众黑板，广播台……等群众文艺和与此有关的文化活动的调查研究。但因本区地区的辽阔，和机关人力的限制，此种调查研究，仅能着重典型，附带进行一般情况的了解。首批下乡的同志，已决定为林沫、芦甸、路琛、贾含四同志。
    另外在此次部门工作的研讨中，由于土地改革学习的结果，全体同志更检讨了过去只注重个人创作，忽视调查研究群众萌芽状态文艺的错误观点。没有把调查研究作为自己的基本工作。而单纯把它作为工作任务，一旦任务完毕，即埋头于自己的创作，平时很少继续研究运动的现状，和进行有关此方面问题的理论学习。经验证明：只有放下包袱向群众文艺学习，才能改造自己的文艺观点，提高业务。也只有这样的结合，才能在思想上解决调查研究与创作的矛盾，而这种结合是完全可能的，研究部同志本身在工作中或多或少已有过此种经验。
    其次，大家感到今天边区群众文艺运动，所以有如此辉煌的成绩，主要是全区群众、民间艺人、县区村的文教工作者和其他工作干部的共同努力的结果。专业文艺工作者（不管是做创作工作或是做运动工作的），必须与他们结合起来，向他们学习，在共同工作中，吸取他们的经验，克服自己的不踏实作风和城市观点，这样才能更好地开展群众文艺运动。
    经过以上的检讨，全体同志认为今后必须加强政治思想学习，加强群众观点，学习走群众路线，积极纠正思想上的缺点，把研究部的工作做好，实现半年工作计划。下乡的同志并提出，在调查研究期间，除为“文艺通讯”写稿，和代表研究部与各方连络外，并将工作地区其他方面的工作情况，随时写成通讯寄给党报，并借以加强自己的写作能力。
    现林沫等四同志，正进行一短期群众文艺运动的学习，不日即可下乡开始工作。留在家里的同志，也已着手整顿通联与资料室。希各地宣教部门及文艺团体，即日起和我们联系，给予帮助，共同为进一步开展边区群众文艺运动而努力！
