Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 21st—Comprehensive report: The Chiang Kai-shek government's Executive Yuan promulgated new regulations on import/export trade and foreign exchange management on the 17th. The main content of the new foreign exchange regulations is as follows: (1) For imported goods such as cotton, rice, wheat, flour, fertilizer, and coal, the Central Bank will supply official exchange rates; for other permitted imported goods and other uses, designated banks will supply foreign exchange at market prices. (2) Foreign exchange earned from exports and remittances from overseas Chinese will be purchased by designated banks at the market price. The "market price" of the above-mentioned foreign exchange is determined by the Central Bank on a daily basis. The benchmark prices ("market prices") posted on the 18th and 19th were both 39,000 "legal tender" of the Chiang family for one U.S. dollar; the purchase price was 38,500, and the selling price was 39,500. As for the so-called "official price," it remains 12,000 "legal tender" for one U.S. dollar. The key point of the new trade regulations is to "soften the old regulations implemented in February to a considerable extent" (according to Agence France-Presse), that is, although the "licensing system" is still temporarily implemented for imports, the quota system and the scope of restrictions have been greatly relaxed, and the "licensing system" that is still temporarily adopted may be abolished in the future.

The above-mentioned new measures of the Chiang Kai-shek government are obviously to adapt to the interests of U.S. imperialism's economic aggression against China, and this measure was taken under the direct supervision of Wedemeyer. In February of this year, under the threat of the exhaustion of foreign exchange reserves, the Chiang Kai-shek government adopted import restrictions and foreign exchange controls that deviated from market prices, which only facilitated the privileged companies of the four major families to engage in smuggling and make fortunes. However, the U.S. side believed that this method was not convenient enough for the export of American goods and capital to China. Therefore, after Wedemeyer came to China, Chiang Kai-shek, in order to show his loyalty to the American masters, disregarded the survival of the Chinese nation, allowing the economic aggression of U.S. imperialism to advance unimpeded. As early as the 1st of this month, Walker, Wedemeyer's economic advisor, had detailed discussions with Yu Hongjun, Chiang Kai-shek's Minister of Finance, on issues such as China's import and export trade and foreign exchange policies. Thus, on the 15th of this month, Zhang Qun made a statement that the Chiang Kai-shek government was willing to sell all economic resources to the United States, and then on the 17th, measures were taken to relax foreign exchange and trade controls. According to sources in Nanjing, after the announcement of this measure, Walker visited Yu Hongjun again on the 18th, showing that the Wedemeyer mission had a direct relationship with this move by the Chiang Kai-shek government. The traitorous nature of this measure is so blatant that the Chiang Kai-shek government even explicitly wrote in the new foreign exchange regulations that the regulations were formulated and promulgated "in preparation for the implementation of the International Monetary Fund Agreement." According to the agreement, China will not be able to have foreign exchange controls and tariff barriers in the future, and China's national industry will only face complete collapse.

Another attempt publicized by the Chiang Kai-shek government for this new foreign exchange and trade measure is said to be to "encourage exports" and "increase overseas remittances" in order to "balance international payments." However, even Huang Yuanbin, an economist who is pro-Kuomintang, said: "If overseas remittances are not allowed to be freely deposited in foreign currency and exchanged for legal tender at any time, they may still escape to Hong Kong. If the goods whose import is prohibited are not completely banned within a time limit, it may also promote the escape of overseas remittances to Hong Kong and become a source of smuggled foreign exchange" (Central News Agency, Nanjing, 18th). Wu Feidan, a professor at Nanjing Central University, also pointed out: The increase in overseas remittances invested in the country does not lie in the increase in the exchange rate by a certain amount, but in the stability of the domestic situation. As for "encouraging exports," this will be impossible, because after the foreign exchange suddenly depreciates from the official price of 13,000 yuan to 39,000 yuan, all commodities, including export goods, will inevitably rise sharply, so that the profits that exporters may obtain after opening up foreign exchange will immediately disappear. The Chiang Kai-shek government's attempt to save its external exhaustion crisis and the entire financial and economic crisis will not achieve its goals. The new measures only show the further deepening of Chiang Kai-shek's betrayal of the country and U.S. imperialism's aggression against China, and mark the further deterioration of Chiang Kai-shek's economic crisis, such as the foreign exchange depreciating by more than three times at once. In addition, the new measures will once again provide the privileged companies of the four major families with opportunities to steal from the national treasury and make huge fortunes from the crisis, because the cotton, grain, coal, and fertilizer imported at the official exchange rate (that is, obtaining subsidies from the Chiang Kai-shek government) are all under the control of the privileged companies of the four major families, and they will obtain more than three times the illegal profits. As ordinary people who are market consumers, they will be cruelly exploited again due to soaring prices. Professor Wu Feidan of Central University said: Except for specific items that can be imported with foreign exchange at the official price, merchants "who purchase foreign exchange at the market price and import daily necessities will inevitably cause prices to rise sharply, and those who can apply for foreign exchange at the official price will become rich because of this" (according to Central News Agency, Nanjing, 18th). While announcing the new foreign exchange and trade regulations, the Chiang Kai-shek government's Executive Yuan announced the establishment of two centralized organizations: the "Export-Import Management Committee" and the "Foreign Exchange Stabilization Fund Committee." The former is directly under the Chiang Kai-shek family's Executive Yuan, with Zhang, a financial magnate of the political science faction who has recently been favored by U.S. imperialism, as the chairman. The new regulations stipulate that all applications for export declarations by exporters and applications for import licenses by importers shall be handled by the committee. The "Foreign Exchange Stabilization Fund Committee" is directly under the Chiang Kai-shek family's Central Bank, and has the power to designate specific banks and brokers to buy and sell foreign exchange to "regulate" export trade and establish a "Foreign Exchange Fund Account" in the Central Bank, where the Central Bank can borrow foreign exchange and legal tender to "balance" the amount of foreign exchange dollars. Chen Guangfu, an American comprador and a big shot in the Song family, was appointed as the chairman of the committee.

　　蒋党卖国更露骨颁布外汇新条例
  　美国经济侵华日益加深
    我民族工业将只有彻底垮台一途
    四大家族更要大发危机财
  　人民将遭受更残酷的剥夺
    【新华社陕北二十一日电】综合报导：蒋政府行政院于十七日公布了进出口贸易及外汇管理新条例。新外汇条例主要内容为：（一）对棉、米、麦、面粉、肥料、煤等输入物品，由中央银行供给官价外汇，其余被许可之进口货及其他用途，由指定银行按市价供给外汇。（二）对输出所得之外汇及华侨汇款，则由指定的银行按外汇市价购进。上面所谓外汇的“市价”，系由中央银行逐日挂牌规定。十八、十九两日挂牌基准价（“市价”）均为美金一元换蒋家“法币”三万九千元，收入为三万八千五百元，售出为三万九千五百元。至于所谓“官价”，则仍为美金一元换“法币”一万二千元。新贸易条例的要点，是把“二月实施的旧条例软化至相当程度”（法新闻社语），即对输入虽仍暂行“许可制”，然限额制度与限制的范围却大大的放宽了，而且暂时仍采用的“许可制度”，将来还可能取消。
    上述蒋政府的新措施，首先显然是为了适应美帝国主义经济侵华的利益，且此项措施是在魏德迈直接监督之下采取的。今年二月蒋政府在外汇基金枯竭威胁下，曾采取仅仅便利于四大家族特权公司走私发财的进口限制与远离市价的外汇管制办法，但美方认为此项办法对美国商品与资本的对华输出不够方便，于是魏德迈来华后，蒋介石为了表示对美国主子效忠，就不顾中国民族生存，让美帝国主义经济侵华力量得以毫无阻碍的长驱直进。还在本月一日，魏德迈的经济顾问华尔克即与蒋家财政部长俞鸿钧，详谈中国进出口贸易及外汇政策等问题。于是就有了本月十五日张群关于蒋政府愿意出卖一切经济资源给美国的声明，并又有了十七日放宽外汇与贸易管制的措施。据南京消息：此项措施公布后，华尔克于十八日再度访问俞鸿钧，显示魏德迈使团与蒋政府此举有直接关系。此一措施之卖国性质如此露骨，蒋政府甚至在新外汇条例上明文写出该条例是为了“准备实行国际货币基金协定”而制订颁行的。而根据该协定，中国今后即不能有外汇管制与关税壁垒，中国民族工业将只有彻底垮台。
    此次外汇贸易新措施，为蒋政府所煊染的另一企图，据说是要“鼓励出口”与“增加侨汇”，借以“平衡国际收支”。但即使是亲国民党的经济学家黄元彬亦称：“侨汇若不准其自由存放外币及随时提换法币，仍有逃至香港的可能。对禁止进口之货物，如不限期禁绝，也可促使侨汇逃港，成为走私外汇之来源”（中央社十八日南京电）。南京中央大学教授吴斐丹也指出：向国内投资的侨汇的增加，并不在于汇率提高若干，而在于国内局势之安定。至于“鼓励出口”，这将是不可能的，因为外汇由官价一万三千元骤然贬值为三万九千元之后，包括出口品在内的一切商品必然急骤上涨，从而出口商在开放外汇后可能获得之利润，将立刻归于乌有。蒋政府企图借此挽救其外枯竭的危机与整个财政经济危机，将不能达到目的。新措施只是表明蒋介石卖国与美帝国主义侵华的进一步加深，并标志了蒋介石经济危机之更加恶化，如外汇一下子就贬低了三倍以上。除此以外，新措施将再一次为四大家族的特权公司提供了盗窃国库、大发危机财的机会，因为按照官价获得外汇（即获得蒋政府的补贴）进口的棉花、粮食、煤炭、肥料，均在四大家族特权公司的控制下，他们将获得三倍以上的非法利润。作为市场消费者的老百姓，则由于物价暴涨，将再一次受到残酷剥夺。中大教授吴斐丹说：除特定物品能以官价获得外汇进口外，商人“以市价购入外汇而输入日用品，必使物价大涨，而能请得官价外汇者，将因此而致富”（据中央社十八日南京电）。蒋政府行政院与宣布新外汇及贸易条例同时，宣布“输出入管理委员会”及“外汇平衡基金委员会”两集权组织的成立。前者直隶蒋家行政院，以新近得到美帝国主义青睐的政学系财阀张主任委员。新条例规定，凡出口商申请报关出口，及进口商申请给予输入许可证，均由该会办理。“外汇平衡基金委员会”则直蒋家中央银行，有权指定特定银行及经纪人买卖外汇“调节”出口贸易及在中央银行设立“外汇基金户”，由央行借支外汇及法币以“平衡”外汇美元额。美国买办、宋系巨角陈光甫被任命为该会主任委员。
