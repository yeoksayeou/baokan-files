　　Changping Village Students
  　Promote Production and Thrift
    [Our Newspaper Huguan News] Changping Village School strengthened education on production to overcome famine, guiding students to recall the pain of 1943. This enabled students to launch publicity campaigns everywhere. During their spare time, they organized thirty older children into groups, carrying farm tools for gathering wild vegetables and shouting slogans like "More wild vegetables can overcome famine, human effort can conquer nature!" They gathered wild vegetables three times, totaling 2,565.5 catties, thus promoting production and famine relief among the entire village. Da'an School also launched a discussion among students on production and famine relief at noon on July 21st. A female student, Xinmei, said, "My sister-in-law is still sitting around and not replanting." Fuzhong also said, "De Cun's wife is the number one lazy person." When discussing thrift, all but four of the twenty-six students said, "I ate noodles for lunch today." Everyone clamored, "Whoever doesn't save and replant is just looking for death!" In order to save themselves and others, they decided to form a life-saving team and elected Zhenzhong and Baoxiu as the captain and vice-captain. They would start by inspecting their own families to see if they were saving and replanting, and then inspect neighboring families to carry out persuasive education. Ankou School also set a plan for the whole school to collect 340 catties of dried vegetables, and has already completed 210 catties. They also set conditions to actively complete the task: not to damage crops while collecting vegetables, and to persuade their families to complete the task. The whole school launched a campaign to perform meritorious service. Students in Qiaoshang Village, Sixth District, also set a plan for each person to collect 15 catties of dried vegetables and 25 catties of black leaves. The entire school of thirty students can collect 750 catties of black leaves, worth 50 yuan per catty, totaling 37,200 yuan, which can be invested in production, earning a monthly dividend of 4,100 yuan, which can be used for students' tuition fees, achieving self-sufficiency in tuition and reducing the burden on families. Beixingtou also led students to pick up sheep manure during the lunch break and sell it for money to buy pens and ink. In the afternoon, they collected vegetables and spun cotton. On Sundays, they organized older children to transport and sell charcoal. Before the masses took action, the school first organized sixty-two children to collect 1,240 catties of vegetables, thus promoting the village's production and famine relief movement.

　　常平等村学生
  　宣传推动生产节约
    【本报壶关讯】常平村学校加强生产渡荒教育，引导学生回顾四三年的痛苦，这样使学生在各处展开宣传，并在课余时间，组织三十个大儿童，成群结队，拿着打菜的农具喊着“多采野菜能渡荒，人能胜天有保障”的口号，三次打菜二千五百六十五斤半，这样推动了全村群众的生产渡荒。大安学校也于七月二十一日晌午在学生中展开了生产渡荒的讨论，女生新妹说：“我嫂还坐着不补种”。福忠也说：“德存媳妇就是头一个大懒汉”。谈到节约方面，二十六个学生除了四个外，都说：“我今晌午吃的是面”，这样大家吵着说：“谁不节约补种，就等于自己寻死”，为了救自己，救别人，决定成立救命队，并选振中、保秀为正副队长，先从检查自家入手，是否节约补种，然后再检查到邻家，进行说服教育。安口学校也订了全校采三百四十斤干菜的计划，现已完成二百一十斤，并订出条件，积极完成任务：在采菜中不踏坏庄稼，并说服动员家里完成任务，全校展开了立功运动。六区桥上村学生也订了每人采十五斤干菜与二十五斤黑叶的计划，全校三十个学生，可采黑叶七百五十斤，每斤五十元，共值三万七千二百元，投入生产，每月可赚红利四千一百元，可供学生的学习费，做到学费自给，减轻家里负担。北行头也领导学生在歇晌时拾羊粪，卖上钱供自己的笔、墨钱，下午课余时采菜、纺花，星期并组织大儿童运输卖炭，在群众未动手时，学校先组织儿童六十二人，采菜一千二百四十斤，这样推动了全村的生产渡荒运动。
