    Xinhua Bookstore Announces Mass Culture Writing Award

    The Propaganda Department of the CCP Jin-Ji-Lu-Yu Central Bureau has allocated 200,000 yuan, which the bookstore will supplement with another 200,000 yuan, totaling 400,000 yuan, as writing awards. These awards will be used to encourage excellent works published by the bookstore in the future that promote the mass culture movement. Our region's people have demonstrated boundless mass power, created infinitely rich lives, and produced countless heroic figures, vivid stories, and working innovations in the Patriotic Self-Defense War, the emancipation movement, and the production movement. As a result, the people's thinking has changed, and their cultural demands have also increased. In order to reflect this magnificent reality and meet the people's urgent demands for ideological and cultural emancipation, everyone will enthusiastically respond to this call from the Central Bureau's Propaganda Department to encourage writing. The regulations for the award of this prize money are as follows: 1. From August to the end of December, all books initially published by the bookstore will be eligible for nomination. At the end of the year, the bookstore will select and submit them to the Central Bureau's Propaganda Department for approval, after which the awards will be announced and distributed. 2. The scope of works includes all aspects of cultural knowledge, whether literary, scientific, historical, geographical, applied, current political, ideological cultivation, etc. As long as the content can reflect reality, enlighten and educate the people, and have the effect of promoting work, and the writing technique is excellent, they are all eligible for nomination and award. 3. Award-winning works will be given prizes in three grades: First Prize: 50,000 yuan, Second Prize: 30,000 yuan, Third Prize: 10,000 yuan. For particularly excellent works, in addition to receiving prizes according to the assessed grade, the bookstore may also issue special remuneration of one yuan per word. 4. After the publication of the books, permission must be granted for the bookstore to include them in various series such as the New Mass Series, the Mass Science Series, and the Literary Series published by the bookstore. The work of developing the mass culture movement is urgent, and serving the people is glorious. All comrades in the cultural circles in this region are requested to send us their best works! We and the masses are eagerly awaiting them!
