    Shaanxi-Gansu-Ningxia Militia Guerrillas
    Wipe Out 400 Chiang Kai-shek Troops in Suppression Campaign
    [Xinhua News Agency, Northwest, 31st] The Shaanxi-Gansu-Ningxia militia guerrillas have won a victory against the suppression campaign. In early June, Hu Zongnan used six and a half brigades from his First Army, Twenty-ninth Army, and other units to launch a "suppression" campaign from Yan'an, Panlong, Yanchuan, and Yongping areas, dividing into groups and advancing cautiously in the Ansai, Zichang, and Zhidan areas, finding nothing but empty space and beatings everywhere they went. The Ansai First District guerrillas bypassed the main enemy force, went deep into the Hezhuang District, 20 li north of Yan'an, and intercepted the enemy's baggage train, destroying one enemy vehicle and killing or wounding more than ten enemy soldiers. On June 29th, the Yan'an North District guerrillas, with just over 30 men, repelled an enemy regiment at Bangaochuan. The Zhidan guerrillas routed over 100 members of the "Home Return Corps," wounding the corps commander and recovering more than 200 head of cattle, sheep, and mules that had been seized. The Panlong guerrillas actively harassed the Xianyu Highway, completely eliminating the enemy's "Second War Zone Cooperative" transportation team within ten days. In total, during the anti-"suppression" campaign in June, 397 enemy soldiers were killed or wounded, and five machine guns and 270 long and short guns were seized.
