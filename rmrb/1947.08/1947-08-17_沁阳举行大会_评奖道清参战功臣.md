Qinyang Holds Conference
  　To Commend Veterans of the Daqing Campaign

　　[Reported from Qinyang by our newspaper] The county government held a commendation and evaluation conference on the 3rd of this month to exchange war experiences and enhance enthusiasm for participation. Three hundred and twenty people attended. After Chairman Chang and County Head Ren gave reports, veterans eagerly spoke, sharing their exemplary deeds.

　　Wu Lifu, a militiaman from the Second District, educated prisoners of war by comparing politics and treatment, and personally cooked for them. After arriving at the reception center, he recognized two major traitor ringleaders.

　　Zhou Maoshun, a 61-year-old civilian laborer from the Sixth District, volunteered to participate in the war by carrying ladders. Enemy artillery fire buried him in dust, but he got up without flinching and still erected the ladder onto the city wall.

　　Zhao Qixing and Tian Sichao, militiamen from the Second District, captured four enemy soldiers in Shaqian, seizing one light machine gun, one rifle, and two horses.

　　Yu Qihui, a civilian laborer from Shanwangzhuang, bravely ran to the front of the troops under enemy fire, erecting the ladder onto the city wall. He then climbed the wall and rescued three signal flags.

　　Zhao Changjiang from the Fourth District seized three rifles, two pistols, and captured two enemy soldiers. After everyone reported their merits, sixteen were finally selected as special-class meritorious individuals, forty-one as first-class, and ninety-four as second-class, totaling one hundred and fifty-one people. All received material rewards, and one hundred and twenty-nine people received verbal praise. Students from Qinyang Middle School came to present flowers. Amidst warm applause, the meritorious individuals were exceptionally excited, feeling extremely honored, and spoke one after another, vowing to participate in the war again next time and make great contributions.

　　[Reported from Northern Henan by our newspaper] Comrade Niu Yonghuai, squad leader of the Sixth Squad of the Ninth Company of Unit 205, was a regimental rescue hero last year, single-handedly rescuing fourteen signal flags. Since the merit-making campaign began this year, he has again been rated as a first-class meritorious individual of the brigade. After the commendation, Comrade Ding Naiguang, the County Head of Wenxian, convened a mass meeting of 7,000 people in a certain place on July 12th to congratulate Comrade Niu Yonghuai, present gifts, and hang a plaque. After the recovery of Wuxiu, Comrade Niu Yonghuai went home to visit. Upon hearing the news, the masses flocked to offer their condolences. The village cadres specially hosted a banquet on August 1st. In the evening, they convened a welcoming conference of six or seven hundred people in the village. Squad Leader Niu told stories of killing the enemy in public and expressed his determination to avenge the deceased elders and protect everyone's liberation by making more contributions and killing more enemies on the front lines, and seizing weapons. He affirmed to everyone: "The situation will not change again! The great counteroffensive is coming soon! I hope everyone boldly and thoroughly liberates themselves!" After Niu Yonghuai returned to the team, he mobilized the entire squad to make new enemy-killing plans: "…In five battles, we captured two machine guns, twenty rifles, and twenty-five prisoners; I myself [captured] one rifle, one machine gun..." Strive for more achievements to respond to the hopes of the elders and the warm congratulations of County Head Ding and District Head Zhang! (Wen Lian)
