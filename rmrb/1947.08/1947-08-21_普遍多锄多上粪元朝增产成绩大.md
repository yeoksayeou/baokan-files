　　【Jinan News, Southern Hebei, 19th】 Since the Yuan Dynasty District Party Committee convened a joint meeting of cadres above the county level, it has been leading the masses to increase production, and has achieved great results in more than two months. The number of pigs in the county has reached 30,000, doubling from last year, and manure production has greatly increased. In Zhangzhen alone, 17 new pigsties have been added. By the end of June, the county had increased manure by 150,000 large carts, which could increase one large cart per mu of land. In terms of deep plowing, more hoeing, early planting, and more fertilization: By the end of June, most fields had been hoed three times. In Gaofulu's group in Gaofuzhuang, Fifth District, last year, each mu of millet land received one cart of manure, this year one and a half carts; last year plowed two and a half inches deep, this year three inches; last year hoed twice, this year three times; last year the yield was six and a half dou per mu, this year it is expected to be eight dou. In terms of planting special crops: peanuts have been planted on 110,000 mu throughout the county. In Beilizhuang and Wuchengji, peanuts account for one-third of the cultivated area. Each mu of peanuts can yield 200 to 500 jin, equivalent to several times the harvest of food crops. In addition, 3,600 mu of wasteland have been reclaimed in the northern district of Jiuchaobei. 350,000 trees have been planted throughout the county. In terms of sideline production throughout the county, there are 200 oil mills and more than 300 wood factories. The income from sideline businesses (flour mills, winnowing fan weaving, woodworking) in Gaofuzhuang, Fifth District, reached 4.95 million yuan in five months, with a dividend of over 20,000 yuan per person. In Mengzhuang, Third District, sideline profits reached 180,000 yuan in half a month. The reasons for achieving the above results are: First, the leadership clearly focused on increasing production to achieve mutual aid, calling on the masses to work harder, produce more grain, engage in more sideline businesses, and earn more money. They also launched a meritorious service campaign in conjunction with production, and promptly commended model groups and model individuals. Individuals were awarded merits and wore red armbands, and model plaques were hung for the entire group, which greatly improved the masses' production enthusiasm. Second, agriculture and sideline businesses were combined, and sideline businesses were used to support agriculture, solving the problem of surplus labor after mutual aid. For example, the whole group in Fangge Village, First District, engaged in sideline businesses through mutual aid. In the past, they lacked food for three months of the year, but this year each person's income is enough to eat for the next year. Third, mutual aid was promoted from lower forms such as group plowing. After the land reform, generally people bought livestock together, and if they bought together, they had to use them together. At least two animals were needed to form a group plow. Thus, a natural mutual aid among the masses was formed. This mutual aid basis was used to improve, set an example, and establish a county-wide production banner; and activists from various villages were mobilized to visit, using concrete examples to educate the masses.

　　普遍多锄多上粪元朝增产成绩大
    【本报冀南十九日电】元朝自区党委召开县以上干部联席会后，即紧领导群众增产，两个多月中已获很大成绩。全县猪已达三万只，较去年增加一倍，产粪大增，只张镇即新增十七个猪圈。至六月底，全县增粪十五万大车，每亩地可增一大车。在深耕、多锄、早种、多施肥等方面：至六月底，一般的都锄到三遍。五区高庄高福鹿组去年谷地每亩一车粪，今年一车半，去年犁二寸半深，今年犁三寸，去年锄二遍，今年锄三遍，去年每亩收六斗半，今年可收八斗。在种特种作物方面：全县点花生达十一万亩。北里庄、武城集点种之花生占耕地面积三分之一，每亩花生可收二百斤到五百斤，等于食粮收获之数倍。另外旧朝北区开荒三千六百亩。全县植树三十五万株。全县副业生产，仅油坊即有二百座，木厂三百余座。五区高庄副业（粉坊、编簸箕、木作）收入，五个月中达四九五万元，每人分红二万余元。三区孟庄半月期间，副业盈利即达十八万元。获得以上成绩的原因：一、领导上明确了从增产着手，达到互助，号召群众多干活，多打粮，多搞副业，多赚钱，并结合生产开展了立功运动，及时表扬了模范组、模范人，个人记功佩带红袖章，全组记功悬挂模范牌，这样大大提高了群众生产情绪。二、农副业结合，用副业支持农业，解决了互助起来剩余劳力问题。如一区房葛村全组互助搞副业，过去全年缺三个月粮食，今年每人收入即够明年食用。三、从群众搭犋等低级形式推动互助。土地改革后，一般都是伙买牲口，伙买就须伙用，最低两个牲口才能搭犋。于是就形成了群众的自然互助。从这种互助基础去提高，以典型示范，树立全县增产旗帜；并发动各村积极分子去参观，用具体榜样去教育群众。
