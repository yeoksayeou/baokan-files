Xinhua News Agency, Frontline of Hebei-Shandong-Henan, 10th: In the Yangshanji battle, the People's Liberation Army found three Japanese soldiers among the captured Chiang Kai-shek troops. One, Suzuki Masanori, from Tokyo, Japan, 35 years old, was drafted into the Japanese army in 1943 and served as a car driver in the Japanese army. In 1945, he was accepted as a surrender by the Chiang Kai-shek army in Wuhan and was immediately incorporated into Chiang Kai-shek's 92nd Army, and later assigned to the 32nd Division as a car driver. Another, Lin Fujii, 25 years old, graduated from a motor vehicle vocational school, and worked as a car driver in Chiang Kai-shek's 32nd Division with Suzuki Masanori. The third, Naka Sen Akio, 19 years old, from Tokyo, graduated from middle school, and served as a bugler, a private first class in the 8th Company, 3rd Battalion, 279th Regiment of Chiang's 70th Division. These three Japanese soldiers were captured at the same time when the 32nd Division and 70th Division of Chiang Kai-shek's army, stationed at Yangshanji, and the 66th Division were annihilated. This is yet another proof of Chiang Kai-shek using Japanese soldiers to massacre Chinese compatriots.

Xinhua News Agency, Shandong, 10th: Qingdao News: The Chiang Kai-shek Second Pacification Zone in Jinan actually held a farewell banquet on the 14th of last month for thirteen Japanese war criminals, including Colonel Santo, with Yang Yuchun, the director of the Second Department of the Pacification Zone, cordially hosting them. During the banquet, they raised their glasses and drank heartily, shouting "Banzai," more so than when bidding farewell to close relatives and friends, displaying an extremely ugly performance.

　　蒋贼使用日人屠杀同胞
  　羊山集我俘日军三名
    【新华社冀鲁豫前线十日电】羊山集战斗中解放军在被俘蒋军内查出日军三名。一名铃木政则日本东京人，三十五岁，一九四三年被征入伍，在日军内任汽车司机，一九四五年在武汉由蒋军受降，即被编入蒋军九十二军，后又被划归三十二师充任汽车司机。一名林藤一，二十五岁，汽车专门学校毕业，与铃政木则在蒋军三十二师充当汽车司机。一为中专秋雄十九岁，东京人，中学毕业，在蒋七十师二七九团三营八连充当上等兵司号员。该三名日军，均在羊山集蒋军三十二师七十师留守处于六十六师被歼灭时，同时被俘。此又一次证明蒋介石使用日军屠杀中国同胞。
    【新华社山东十日电】青岛报讯：济南蒋记第二绥靖区竟于上月十四日为日寇战犯山同大佐等十三名设宴饯别，由该绥靖区第二处处长杨遇春殷勤招待，席间举杯痛饮高呼“万岁”，尤过于惜别亲人密友，丑态百出。
