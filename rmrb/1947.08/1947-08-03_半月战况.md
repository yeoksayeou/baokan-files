Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, July 31st: The focus of the national war situation remains on the southwestern and central Shandong battlefields. A portion of General Liu Bocheng's main force has achieved three more major victories in the southwestern Shandong area, annihilating three division headquarters, six complete brigades, and two complete regiments of the Chiang army. Since crossing the Yellow River on the night of June 30th, exactly one month ago, this line has annihilated a total of four enemy division headquarters, nine complete brigades, and two complete regiments, and liberated the vast areas of Juancheng, Yuncheng, Dingtao, Cao County, Jiaxiang, and other areas previously occupied by the Chiang army. The victory of this offensive, coordinated with the operations in Shandong, disrupted the enemy's deployment, had a positive impact on the national war situation—primarily the war situation in the southeastern theater—and prepared favorable conditions for completely smashing the Chiang Kai-shek bandit's invading forces.

As we predicted, following the great victories in Yuncheng and Dingtao, General Liu Bocheng led his troops eastward on the 12th and, in the area between Jinxiang and Juye, firmly grasped the main force of the Chiang army attempting to pincer the People's Liberation Army, thoroughly and completely annihilating the 32nd Division and the 70th Division, and surrounding two brigades of the 66th Division at Yangshanji, south of Juye. Chiang Kai-shek hastily deployed reinforcements, but the reinforcements hesitated on the Shangqiu-Jinxiang line, unwilling to advance. It was not until the 22nd that Wang Jingjiu, commander of the Second Field Army Group directly under Chiang Kai-shek's Army Headquarters, personally supervised the 58th Division and the 199th Brigade of the 66th Division, and advanced northward from Jinxiang under the cover of aircraft and tanks, while the surrounded enemy also launched an attack southward with the 38th Regiment of the 13th Brigade, attempting to coordinate from north and south to open the encirclement. At this time, the Central News Agency loudly proclaimed that the "National Army" had won an unprecedented victory in the Yangshanji area. Unexpectedly, before the proclamation died down, within two hours, the 199th Brigade and the 38th Regiment of the 13th Brigade had been completely wiped out by the People's Liberation Army. The Chiang army besieged in Yangshanji could only lament its fate, and on the 28th, this trusted force of Chen Cheng was finally completely annihilated. This battle demonstrated that the Chiang army's combat spirit and strength have been greatly weakened, and that in the face of the enormous pressure of the People's Liberation Army, there is only death if they do not surrender.

In southwestern Shandong, the Chiang army was not only defeated by the People's Liberation Army, but more importantly, it was defeated by the people. Wherever the People's Liberation Army has arrived or is about to arrive, the people have risen up with guns and ammunition, either assisting in the battle at the front, attacking enemy transportation, or setting up nets to capture the enemy, creating a sea of flames. Militias and guerrillas in Yuncheng, Heze, Qibin, Nanwang, Jiaxiang, and other places have captured more than 300 regular enemy soldiers each, including many officers above the rank of battalion commander, including Li Mingya, deputy commander of the 55th Division. Almost no scattered Chiang soldiers were able to escape the dragnet. As an old villager said to a captured Chiang soldier: "Sun Wukong cannot escape the palm of the people."

Coordinating with the offensive of the army crossing south, General Liu Bocheng's Henan-North troops launched an offensive on the Daokou-Qinghua Railway on the 16th, annihilating 2,000 enemies and capturing the cities of Wuzhi and Xiuwu. On the 12th, the Taiyue Local Corps annihilated an entire regiment of the Chiang-American mechanized corps of 1,500 men in a two-hour battle, with enemy-own casualties at a ratio of 50:1, creating a glorious record for the local corps to independently annihilate Chiang Kai-shek bandits' regular army. Another unit of the People's Liberation Army annihilated more than 1,300 enemies and captured Xia County on the 14th. The Henan-Anhui-Jiangsu Liberation Army also recovered Fugou County on the 18th, and on the 24th, took advantage of the victory to recapture the important town of Zhoujiakou, inflicting heavy casualties on the American-equipped Chiang army.

After the People's Liberation Army recovered vast lands on the south bank of the Yellow River, the democratic government immediately mobilized more than 100,000 people to rush to repair the south bank of the Yellow River embankment, which had been halted due to the Chiang army's occupation. In the section near Changyuan, one-fifth of the People's Liberation Army soldiers provided armed cover while assisting in the construction. By the 25th, the massive projects of the Lin-Yellow Embankment and the Canal Embankment, totaling more than 300 li, had been completed. In addition to continuing to send American-made aircraft to continuously bomb dangerous works such as the Sunkou of Shouzhang, the Guozhuang of ＠shan, and the Taochengbu of Zhangqiu, and strafing the embankment repair people, Chiang Kai-shek personally flew to the Yellow River embankment on the 19th to inspect the embankment at low altitude, revealing his determination to use flood tactics after repeated defeats.

In the East China region, in the face of the enemy's "key offensives," with the prestige of annihilating 50 Chiang army brigades in the past year, they have moved mysteriously, using mobility to control the enemy, and have gradually shifted to the offensive. Starting on the 17th, our army launched a counterattack in the Donglidian-Nanma line west of Linqu and Yishui, eliminating one regiment of the main force of Chiang's 11th Division and more than 7,000 other Chiang soldiers. By this point, since the Chiang army launched its "key offensive" on the 25th of last month, the front line has lost more than 11,000 people. At the same time, two routes of the Liberation Army entered and exited the Jinpu Railway: one route, after sweeping through Feixian, Zaozhuang, and Yixian, launched an offensive from a commanding position on the Xuzhou-Ziyang section; the other route went south from Tai'an, captured Dawenkou on the 10th, and recovered Ningyang on the 13th. On the Jiaoji Railway in the north, the People's Liberation Army also launched an offensive from the 10th to the 14th, annihilating more than 800 enemies and recovering the cities of Gaomi and Jiaoxian, which had been occupied for a time. The enemy was panicked, with chaotic steps, and will suffer new and huge blows on the East China battlefield.

The military and civilians in central China, who have long been under Chiang's rule, are facing the Chiang army's unprecedented brutal sweeps, encirclements, scorched-earth clearing, and bloody clearing. Under the tragic slogan of "one person killed, ten thousand avenge," they continue to persevere in their victorious struggle. After the main force of the Liberation Army transferred, local armed forces and militias have annihilated 50,000 enemies, and two-thirds of the land is still under the administration of the democratic government. Of the 138 towns in northern Jiangsu, the Chiang army has only occupied 25. The local people are conducting guerrilla warfare and distributing land, being brave and unyielding. Even a 13-year-old child will never say the word "surrender" under the Chiang bandits' knives and axes. The deepening of land reform is the guarantee of victory behind enemy lines in central China.

In other areas such as the Northwest battlefield, the Jin-Cha-Ji battlefield, and the Northeast battlefield, the war situation has not changed much in the past half month. Our Jin-Sui army attacked Yan's army, which was looting grain in the central Shanxi plains, and captured Luocheng Town north of Fenyang and Xun'an Town southwest of Wenshui on the 20th and 21st. In the Jin-Cha-Ji area, in order to save the defeats after the Qingcang and Pingbao battles, the Chiang army scraped together seven divisions and one brigade to launch a large-scale invasion of central Hebei. They have been defeated by the Liberation Army and the people's armed forces. Xiongxian, Lixian, Boye, Suning, Gaoyang, and other places have been lost and recovered in succession. Now there are no enemy traces in the heart of central Hebei. The Northeast Democratic Allied Army continued to gain some local victories. On the 14th, it attacked Xitaizi, west of Faku, and defeated the 6th Division of the Chiang-puppet Cavalry 1st Army, capturing the Chiang army's division chief of staff. On the 16th, it annihilated more than 1,000 Chiang soldiers who invaded from Jilin at Yantongshan. In the west, south, and Rehe of Manchuria, the Chiang-puppet bandits also annihilated more than 1,000 Chiang-puppet bandits in the first and middle ten days of the month. The wavering and disarray of the Chiang army in the Northeast is becoming increasingly serious.

Amidst the tense military situation of the Kuomintang, Grand Tutor Wedemeyer, in the capacity of a special envoy, flew to Nanjing on the 22nd. This caused Chiang Kai-shek and his subordinates, who were originally "generally depressed," to become "extremely busy" (both quotes from the Associated Press). The Ministry of National Defense was busy preparing new operational plans, Chen Cheng and Bai Chongxi requested instructions, and Hu Zongnan, Fu Zuoyi, and Li Zongren were also summoned to Beijing and busy listening to instructions. At the same time, several American news agencies repeatedly instructed Chiang Kai-shek to "reform the army" and "change tactics." This fully demonstrates that the civil war launched by Chiang Kai-shek is "fought for the United States" (testimony of the American reactionary group, the China Policy Association). The reason why these ugly creatures are so "extremely busy" is nothing more than selling more Chinese sovereignty and begging their master to save their dog lives. But if thirteen months ago, the same Wedemeyer equipped and trained forty-five divisions for Chiang Kai-shek and transported fourteen armies to the Northeast and North China battlefields, but could not achieve the desired effect, then how much magic weapon can be taken out today, after it has been discovered that "the CCP has generally gained the initiative" (Associated Press report)? No wonder Wedemeyer had a "headache" as soon as he arrived in Nanjing.

At this time, on the eve of the "August 1st" - the birthday of the People's Liberation Army - the headquarters of the People's Liberation Army announced the historic Public Communique No. 4, announcing the achievements of the first year of the patriotic anti-dictatorial self-defense war to the world. The glorious task of annihilating 100 brigades of American-equipped Chiang troops has been completed. It is believed that on this day next year, the headquarters of the People's Liberation Army will issue a public communique on the elimination of another 100 brigades of Chiang troops as a monument to forever bury the traitorous rule of Chiang Kai-shek.

    半月战况
    （七月十六至三十一日）
    【新华社陕北三十一日电】全国战局重心仍在鲁西南与鲁中战场。刘伯承将军主力一部在鲁西南地区又三获大捷，连歼蒋军三个师部、六个整旅和两个整团。自上月三十日晚渡过黄河，迄今刚好一个月，该线共已歼灭敌人四个师部、九个整旅和两个整团，并解放了鄄城、郓城、定陶、曹县、嘉祥等前被蒋军侵占之广大地区。这一出击的胜利，配合了山东的作战，错乱了敌人的部署，对于全国战局——首先是东南战场的战局——发生良好影响，并准备了有利条件，来彻底粉碎蒋贼进犯军。
    不出我们预料，继郓城、定陶大捷之后，刘伯承将军于十二日挥师东向，在金乡、巨野之间地区，一把抓住企图钳击解放军的将军主力，将三十二师及七十师彻底干脆全部歼灭，包围六十六师的两个旅于巨野以南的羊山集。蒋介石急忙调兵增援，但援兵徘徊于商邱至金乡一线，迟迟不敢前进。至二十二日，始由蒋记陆军总部直辖野战第二集团司令王敬久亲自督率五十八师及六十六师之一九九旅，在飞机、坦克掩护下，由金乡向北挺进，同时被围之敌也以十三旅之三十八团向南出击，企图南北呼应，打开包围圈。此时中央社即高叫“国军”在羊山集地区获得空前大捷，不意叫声未绝，两小时工夫，一九九旅和十三旅之三十八团已被人民解放军全部吃掉。羊山集被围蒋军徒唤奈何，延至二十八日，这一陈诚的亲信部队终于全军复灭。这一战说明蒋军的作战精神和力量已大大削弱，在人民解放军巨大的压力面前，如果不投降只有死亡。
    蒋军在鲁西南，不仅败于人民解放军，而更重要的是败于老百姓。凡解放军已到或将到之处，人民纷纷荷枪实弹而起，或前线助战，或击敌交通，或张网捕敌，形成一片火海。郓城、菏泽、齐滨、南旺、嘉祥等地的民兵游击队各活捉敌正规军三百以上，其中有许多营长以上军官，包括五十五师副师长理明亚在内。凡零星逃散的蒋军几乎没有一个能够逸出天罗地网。正如一个老乡对被俘蒋军说的：孙猴子逃不出老百姓的手掌心。
    配合南渡大军的出击，刘伯承将军豫北部队十六日起在道清路扩展攻势，歼敌二千，连克武陟、修武二城。太岳地方兵团十二日以两小时战斗，一举歼灭蒋美械兵团一个整团一千五百人，敌我伤亡为五十比一，开创了地方兵团单独歼灭蒋贼正规军的光荣纪录。另部解放军则于十四日歼敌一千三百余，攻克夏县。豫皖苏解放军亦于十八日收复扶沟县城，又于二十四日乘胜再克重镇周家口，并给了美械化的蒋军以重大杀伤。
    人民解放军光复黄河南岸广大土地，民主政府立即动员十余万民众抢修前因蒋军侵占而停工的南岸黄堤，长垣附近地段并有五分之一解放军战士一面武装掩护，一面协助赶工，迄二十五日已完成临黄堤、运河堤等三百余里巨大工程。蒋介石除继续派遣美制飞机不断轰炸寿张之孙口，＠山之国庄，张秋之陶城埠等处险工，扫射修堤民众外，并于十九日亲自乘机到黄河堤岸上低飞视察，其在一再惨败之余，决心施用泛滥战术，业已昭然若揭。
    华东方面，在敌“重点进攻”面前，以一年来歼灭蒋军五十个旅的威风，神出鬼没，机动制敌，已逐渐转入主动。十七日起，我军在临朐沂水以西之东里店至南麻一线举行反击，消灭蒋军主力整十一师一团及其他蒋军七千余人。至此蒋军于上月二十五日发动“重点进攻”以来，正面前线已损失一万一千余人。同时，解放军两路进出津浦路：一路在横扫费县、枣庄、峄县后，以居高临下之势，出击徐（州）滋（阳）段；一路由泰安南下，于十日攻克大汶口，十三日收复宁阳。北面胶济路上，人民解放军亦于十日至十四日展开攻势，歼敌八百余名，收复一度被占之高密、胶县两城。敌张惶失措，步伐混乱，将在华东战场遭受新的巨大打击。
    久处蒋后的华中军民，面临蒋军空前残暴的扫荡、合击、焦土清剿与血洗清剿，在“一人被杀万人复仇”的悲壮口号下，继续坚持胜利斗争。在解放军主力转移后，地方武装和民兵已歼敌五万之众，三分之二土地仍在民主政府管理之下，苏北一百三十八个市镇中，蒋军侵占者只二十五个，当地人民边游击，边分地，英勇不屈，连十三岁的小孩在蒋贼刀斧加头之下都绝不说出“投降”两字。土地改革的深入，是华中敌后胜利的保证。
    其他西北战场、晋察冀战场与东北战场，这半月来战局无多大变化。晋绥我军打击向晋中平川抢粮阎军，于二十日与二十一日连克汾阳北之罗城镇和文水西南之埙岸镇。晋察冀方面，蒋军为挽救青沧、平保战后的败迹，东拚西凑，集中七个师一个旅的兵力，向冀中大举窜犯，已为解放军与人民武装击退，雄县、蠡县、博野、肃宁、高阳等地，旋失旋复，现冀中腹心地区已无敌踪。东北民主联军继续得到若干局部胜利，十四日袭击法库以西的西台子，击溃蒋伪骑一军第六师，俘蒋军师参谋长，十六日于烟筒山歼灭自吉林南犯蒋军千余，西满、南满及热河蒋后上中旬间亦歼蒋伪匪一千余名。东北蒋军的动摇与纷乱正日趋严重。
    在国民党军事形势吃紧声中，太上皇魏德迈以特使资格于二十二日飞临南京。这下子原本“普遍沮丧”的蒋介石及其僚属，便“极度忙碌”起来（所引均美联社语）。国防部忙于制作新的作战计划，陈诚、白崇禧请示机宜，胡宗南、傅作义、李宗仁也奉召到京忙于听训。同时，美国的若干通讯社便一再指示蒋介石要“革新军队”和“改变战法”。这充分说明蒋介石所发动的内战是“为美国而战”（美国反动团体对华政策协会供词）。此辈丑类之所以如此“极度忙碌”，无非是在出卖中国更多主权乞求主子救救他们的狗命。但是如果十三个月以前，同是这个魏德迈一手为蒋介石装备和训练了四十五个师，运送十四个军到东北和华北战场，而不能取得预期效果，那末当今天已经发现“中共一般地已获得主动”（美联社消息）以后，又有多大法宝可拿出来呢？这就无怪魏德迈一到南京就立刻闹起“头痛病”来了。
    适于此时，在“八一”——人民解放军生辰——前夜，人民解放军总部公布了历史性的四号公报，将爱国反独裁的自卫战争头一年战绩，公布于全世界。歼灭美制蒋军一百个旅的光荣任务是完成了。相信明年此日——人民解放军总部必将发布消灭蒋军另一百个旅的公报，来作为永远葬送蒋贼卖国统治的纪念碑。
