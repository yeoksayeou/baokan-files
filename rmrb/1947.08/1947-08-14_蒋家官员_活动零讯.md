　　Chiang Kai-shek Officials
  　Activity Snippets
    ◇ At a time when the Northwest People's Liberation Army was severely attacking Hu Zongnan's troops on the outskirts of Yulin, Chiang Kai-shek, the head of the civil war, flew to Yan'an for a two-day "inspection," and flew back to Nanjing on the afternoon of the 8th. During his trip to Yan'an, Chiang met with Hu Zongnan in Xi'an to discuss the Northwest "defense" issue.
    ◇ Chen Cheng held a joint meeting with Wedemeyer in Shenyang, listened to his American superior's instructions regarding the military situation of the civil war in the Northeast, and is continuing to stay in Shenyang to hurriedly convene various military meetings, nervously making various speculations about the Democratic Allied Forces' "Sixth Largest Offensive this Autumn" in their imagination.
    ◇ Kong Xiangxi, the former head of the Executive Yuan of the Kuomintang and one of the leaders of the Four Big Families, flew to the United States from Shanghai on the 10th. Kong told reporters that he was going to "handle some matters in his capacity as the president of the Bank of China." Just as the United States is preparing to exchange large loans for Chiang Kai-shek's larger-scale betrayal of the country, Kong's trip to the United States naturally attracts attention.

　　蒋家官员
  　活动零讯
    ◇内战头子蒋介石于西北人民解放军在榆林外围痛击胡宗南部之际，曾飞延安“视察”两日，于八日下午飞返南京。蒋在其赴延途中，曾与胡宗南在西安会商西北“防务”问题。
    ◇陈诚在沈阳与魏德迈举行过联席会议，聆听过其美国上司关于东北内战军事的指示以后，正继续留在沈阳匆忙召集各种军事会议，神经紧张地对他们意想中的民主联军“今秋第六次最大攻势”作各种猜测。
    ◇国民党前行政院院长四大家族的首领之一孔祥熙，于十日由沪飞美，孔告记者说，他要“以中国银行行长的资格去办些事情”。正当美国准备以大量借款换得蒋介石更大规模的卖国之时，孔赴美之行，自然引人注意。
