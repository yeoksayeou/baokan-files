Jiang’s Defense Ministry News Bureau Announces
    Eight Major Panic Psychological States of the Chiang Army
    Méi Jí

    "Soldiers lack fighting spirit, commanders are in a panic." This is the root cause pointed out by Liu Xueji, the Chief of Staff with the rank of Colonel, after the Chiang army's 70th Division was defeated recently. Jiang's Defense Ministry News Bureau is a newly established special agent and propaganda organization. Fearing that their captured generals and officers did not describe the situation concretely enough, they conducted a more "in-depth and clear" analysis of the psychology of Chiang's soldiers and generals. The bureau's "News Herald" Issue 14 (published on March 16th) contains an article titled "How to Improve Morale," which analyzes eight kinds of panic and uneasy psychological states among Chiang's soldiers. These are listed below, along with excerpts from the original explanations. Any inconsistencies or typos are retained as they are.

    1.  War-Weariness Psychology - "We cannot deny that during the eight years of the War of Resistance Against Japan, our soldier comrades endlessly endured difficult and arduous battlefield lives amidst gunfire and bullets... Furthermore, after a year of... 'bandit suppression' operations, some comrades with weak and wavering confidence inevitably harbor a degree of war-weariness."

    2.  Terror Psychology - Due to the exaggerated propaganda of the "bandit army," ... thinking that the "bandit army" is truly stubbornly resistant, coupled with the ferocity of its henchmen—the militia—thus giving rise to a terror psychology of fearing the bandits."

    3.  Doubt Psychology - "... believing that after the war, there will be demobilization, and soldiers will have no way out, so they may have doubts about today's 'bandit suppression' operations." (Author's note: This kind of doubt seems a bit too far-fetched. The real doubt, I'm afraid, is still unknown here: "When will it be after the war? Even if it's really after the war, I don't think there's much to demobilize in that army. The common people will have long since demobilized it.")

    4.  Pessimistic Psychology - "Because of the domestic political turmoil, the decline of social morality, the people's anxieties... and other such facts stimulate the ears and eyes of our soldier comrades... Therefore, some soldier comrades who do not understand the general trend inevitably develop a pessimistic psychology towards the future of the country and society, and the bandit suppression military operations."

    5.  Resentful Psychology - "The formation of this psychology is actually due to the fact that the current treatment of soldiers is too meager, creating a difficult living situation. Therefore, this kind of resentment towards dissatisfaction with life is relatively common, because it affects the decline of combat morale."

    6.  Peace Psychology - "... Therefore, some soldiers who have not thoroughly recognized the Communist bandits' conspiracies and poisonous schemes have developed this peace psychology, affecting the slackening of 'bandit suppression' operations." (Author's note: Wanting "peace" is a conspiracy, then wanting civil war is "justice"!)

    7.  Passive Psychology - "The formation of this psychology is also due to being poisoned by the Communist bandits' propaganda scheme 'Chinese people don't fight Chinese people,' thinking that bandit suppression is a 'civil war,' and victory or defeat doesn't matter..." (Author's note: Is it "bandit suppression" or "bandits suppressing"? Don't call it "civil war," just call it "pacification of the rebellion," in short, it's dying for the four major families, and the soldiers are still unmotivated.)

    8.  Arrogant Psychology - "... Soldier comrades, holding themselves to be rich in combat skills and experience, relying on superior weapons and sufficient ammunition, thus developing a psychology of pride and arrogance..." (Author's note: The colonel may be a little mistaken about this kind of psychology. I regret to say that Chiang's soldiers, in their original camp, actually lacked the "pride" that this colonel complimented, and never "prided" anything out. But once they are liberated, they appeared, like the heroes such as "Wang Keqin."
    And that kind of "pride" has indeed existed among some officers, and because of this, it helped him to be quickly liberated. But this can't be blamed on them, that kind of pride was sent by American daddy. It's useless to complain about them. We still have to correct this colonel's misunderstanding. We are not very grateful for that kind of "pride," because what determined them to lay down their weapons was not their "self-effacing" "pride," but the fearlessness of our people's soldiers.

    With so many panic and uneasy psychological states, being eliminated in large numbers is natural. But this is not all, the wonderful thing is that after studying for a long time, there is no effective way to overcome fear and improve morale. The author of the article put forward six points: (1) strengthen propaganda, (2) strengthen education, (3) expose conspiracies, (4) strictly organize (use intelligence networks and joint security systems and other special agent methods), (5) improve living conditions, (6) strict rewards and punishments. The first four points have been in place for a long time, and the results are still the same. If the latter two points can be implemented, it will not be Chiang's Kuomintang's private army!

    Eight major psychological states, a complete mess;
    The army's morale has disintegrated, Jiang has no way out!

　　蒋记国防部新闻局宣布
  　蒋军八大恐慌心理
    梅辑
    “兵无斗志，将帅恐慌”，这是最近蒋军七十师被打垮以后，它们的上校参谋处长刘学基指出来的病根。蒋记国防部新闻局是新设的特务和宣传机构，惟恐他们的被俘将校述说得不够具体，对蒋兵蒋将的心理有着更“深入明白”的分析，该局所出“新闻导报”第十四期（三月十六日出版）上有篇“如何提高士气”之文中分析蒋军士兵有八种恐慌不安心理，兹照列如下，并摘录原说明于后，不通处与别字均照旧。
    一、厌战心理——“我们无可讳言的，在八年抗日战争，士兵同志们，无休止地过着艰难困苦的枪林弹雨的沙场生活………再加一年来…………‘剿匪’作战，部分的同志薄弱，信心不坚的士兵，就难免有多少厌战心理存在。”
    二、恐怖心理——由于“匪军”的夸大宣传，…………以为“匪军”真个顽强不堪，再加上它的爪牙——民兵又如何厉害，因而发生怕匪惧匪的恐怖心理。”
    三、怀疑心理——“…………以为战后裁军，士兵没有出路了，所以对今天的‘剿匪’作战，可能有怀疑心理。”（笔者按：此种怀疑，似嫌操心太远了，真正的怀疑”，恐怕还不知这里：“什么时候是战后呢？真战后了，我想那个军也没有什么可裁的，早叫老百姓裁完了。）
    四、悲观心理——“因为国内的政局动荡，社会道德低落，人心的惶惑…………等种种事实，刺激着士兵同志们的耳目，…………故此不明大势的部分士兵同志，难免对国家社会前途和剿匪军事，可能发生悲观心理。”
    五、愤懑心理——“这种心理的形成，实由于目前军人的待遇过于微薄，造成生活困难的现象，故此这种对生活上不满足的愤懑心理较为普遍，因为影响到作战情绪的低落。”
    六、和平心理——“…………所以部分对共匪的阴谋毒计未加彻底认识的士兵，就发了这种和平心理，而影响到‘剿匪’作战的松懈。”（笔者按：要“和平”是阴谋，那末要内战倒是“正义”了！
    七、消极心理——“这种心理的形成，也是由于中了共匪的传宣毒计‘自己人不打自己人’，以为剿匪是‘内战’，胜败也无所谓…………”（笔者按：究竟是“剿匪”；还是“匪剿”？不叫“内战”，就叫“勘乱”吧，总之是替四大家族送死，士兵还是没劲的。）
    八、自大心理——“…………士兵同志们自持作战的技术与经验的丰富，倚赖武器优良，弹药充足，因而发生骄傲自大心理………”。（笔者按：此种心理，恐这位上校有点误会，抱歉的是：蒋军士兵，在他们原来的阵营中，竟缺乏这位上校所恭维的“骄傲”，也从未“骄傲”出什么来，而一旦被解放便出现了，如“王克勤”那样的英雄。
    而那种“骄傲”，在某些军官中曾确乎有过，并且因为这，才帮助了他很快的被解放过来，但这也怪不得他们，那种骄傲是美国爸爸发来的，埋怨他们也无用，还得纠正一下这位上校的误会，我们并不太感谢，那种“骄傲”，因为决定他们放下武器的并不是他们那种“自谦”的“骄傲”，而是我们人民战士的无畏。
    有了这么多恐慌不安的心理，大量被消灭，就是自然而然的事情了。但这还不算，妙在研究了半天，没有效的克服恐惧提高士气的办法。该文作者举出了六条：（一）加强宣传，（二）加强教育，（三）揭破阴谋，（四）严密组织，（运用情报网与联保制度等特务方法），（五）改善生活，（六）赏罚严明。前四点行之正是：已久而结果仍如此，后两点如能行通，也就不成其为蒋记国民党私人的军队了！
    八大心理，一塌糊涂；
    军心已解，蒋无活路！
