Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 12th: According to various sources: Faced with the brutal aggression of Dutch imperialism, Indonesia is more united and fighting for independence and freedom. The Standing Committee of the Indonesian Parliament met on the 9th and unanimously adopted the policy of resolute resistance of the Sjahrir cabinet. All Indonesian democratic parties also wholeheartedly support the current government. The resolution of the Standing Committee pointed out that due to the perfidy of Dutch imperialism in launching a war of aggression against Indonesia, the Linggadjati Agreement no longer exists. Dutch troops must withdraw from the Indonesian islands as soon as possible to ensure Indonesia's complete independence. President Sukarno received reporters on the 7th and stated that Indonesia hopes that the British people will support the Republic of Indonesia's demand for the withdrawal of Dutch troops. He also stated that the United Nations equipped the Dutch army to fight against the Japanese invaders, not to launch a colonial war of aggression against Indonesia. President Sukarno concluded, "The freedom that the Indonesian people have gained cannot be destroyed!"
    
Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 9th: According to various sources: The Indonesian government has sternly rejected the US's proposal for separate "mediation" of the Indonesian-Dutch conflict, and formally notified the United States that it only requires the US government to urge the Security Council to immediately dispatch an "International Arbitration Committee" to Indonesia to accelerate the mediation of the Indonesian-Dutch conflict. The US "mediation" proposal was formally submitted to Indonesia on the 5th by the US Consul General Ford in Batavia. Its purpose is to obstruct the Security Council from conducting arbitration and to repeat Marshall's old tricks in China to harm Indonesia. Indonesian Prime Minister Sjahrir delivered a radio address on the 6th, clearly pointing out that the facts of the past two years have proved that under the separate "mediation" of the United States, the Indonesian-Dutch dispute cannot be truly resolved. The Indonesian government believes that only arbitration by the United Nations is the only way to solve this problem. According to a report by the Indonesian News Agency on the 6th, Indonesian officials revealed that the Republic plans to invite the Soviet Union, the United States, the United Kingdom, China, France, Arabia, India, Pakistan, Australia, and New Zealand to jointly form an "Arbitration Committee" to conduct on-site investigations in Indonesia.
    
Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 12th: According to various sources: While Marshall is actively promoting the United States to separately "mediate" the Indonesian-Dutch dispute, Eugene Meyer, President of the World Bank, announced on the 5th that the United States has agreed to lend the Netherlands 195 million US dollars. The US's poisonous plan of using one hand to "mediate" and the other to help the Netherlands carry out a war of aggression against Indonesia has become clear. Encouraged by this policy of the United States, a week has passed since the Indonesian and Dutch issued a ceasefire order, but the Dutch military's offensive against the Indonesian liberated areas is still being carried out on a large scale. According to the latest news, the Dutch troops who broke the agreement landed in Madura on the 6th and occupied its capital, Pamekasan. Dutch troops in Java have occupied Ambarawa and other places. After seeing through the US "mediation" conspiracy, the Indonesian government is leading the military and civilians to bravely resist the Dutch military's offensive.

Chiang Kai-shek Hates Indonesia
　  In order to Flatter the United States
    
Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 12th: Since the United States supported the Netherlands in launching a war of aggression, it has aroused unanimous protests from peace-loving people around the world and enthusiastically supported the Indonesian independent self-defense movement. However, the Chinese traitor Chiang Kai-shek not only willingly acts as a servant but also hates Indonesia's independence movement in order to flatter his American master. The person in charge of the Information Department of Chiang Kai-shek's Ministry of Foreign Affairs revealed on the 6th when explaining Chiang Kai-shek's policy towards Indonesia that Chiang Kai-shek had "intervened in the Indonesian issue in unison with the United States and Britain" before the Indonesian-Dutch conflict occurred. When the Indonesian-Dutch dispute was submitted to the Security Council for discussion, Chiang Kai-shek again exposed his slavish nature of echoing others. Gu Weijun, Chiang Kai-shek's ambassador to the United States, told US Deputy Secretary of State Lovett that "China (Chiang) is taking a consistent step with the United States." At the same time, the rumor-mongering organ Central News Agency has repeatedly carried out slanders and smears, portraying the heroic self-defense war of the Indonesian People's Army as "looting," "besieging," and "destroying" overseas Chinese, and on the 27th of last month, Chiang Kai-shek's consul general in Batavia, Chiang Chia-tung, even blamed the Indonesian side for the responsibility for harming overseas Chinese in Indonesia in his radio speech. The Chiang Kai-shek special agent organization, the San Qing Tuan branch in Semarang, even raved on the 4th, demanding that Chiang Kai-shek send troops to "protect overseas Chinese." Chiang Kai-shek's reckless actions are maliciously creating unfavorable public opinion for Indonesia and inciting our compatriots to be hostile to the Indonesian people. This conspiracy deserves the serious vigilance of our Indonesian compatriots.

Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 12th: Batavia News: Indonesian Prime Minister Sjahrir made a speech to the Indonesian people and overseas Chinese on the evening of the 8th, refuting the Dutch imperialists' slanderous conspiracy that "Indonesia persecutes overseas Chinese." He stated that the Dutch imperialists are trying their best to deceive the people of the world in an attempt to make people believe that the people of the Republic are hostile to overseas Chinese, and are trying their best to spread rumors and provoke the relationship between overseas Chinese and the Republic of Indonesia. Sjahrir firmly believes that the Dutch imperialists' trick of making overseas Chinese and the Indonesian people hate each other will never succeed. He emphasized that some Indonesian national scum took advantage of the fire to loot and harm the lives and property of overseas Chinese, but it cannot be mistaken that this kind of crime came from the hands of all the Indonesian people.

　　印尼内部团结
  　坚决抵抗荷军
  　拒绝美国单独“调停”
    【新华社陕北十二日电】据各方讯：在残暴的荷兰帝国主义侵略面前，印尼内部更加团结一致，为争取独立自由而斗争。印尼国会常务委员会于九日集会，一致通过沙利佛丁内阁的坚决抗战政策，印尼各民主党派亦衷心支持现政府。常务委员会决议中指出：由于荷兰帝国主义的背信弃义，发动侵略印尼的战争，此后林加牙蒂协定已不复存在。荷军必须尽早由印尼各岛撤走，以保证印尼获得完全独立之目的。苏加诺总统于七日招待记者，表示印尼希望英国人民支持印尼共和国对荷军撤离印尼的要求。并称：联合国装备荷军是让他去打日寇，而不是为了发动侵略印尼的殖民地战争。苏加诺总统最后说：“印尼人民已经获得的自由，是不能被消灭的！”
    【新华社陕北九日电】各方讯：印尼政府已严词拒绝美国单独“调停”印荷冲突之建议，并正式通知美国，只要求美政府促使安理会立即派遣“国际仲裁委员会”至印尼，以加速调停印荷冲突。按美国“斡旋”建议已于五日由美驻巴城总领事福特正式向印尼提出，其目的系在阻塞安理会进行仲裁，并图重袭马歇尔在华故技危害印尼。印尼内阁总理沙利佛丁为此于六日发表广播演说，明确指出：两年来的事实证明，在美国单独“调停”下，并不能真正解决印荷纠纷。印尼政府认为只有由联合国同仲裁，才是解决此一问题的唯一办法。另据印尼通讯社六日讯，印尼官方人士透露，共和国拟邀请苏、美、英、中、法、阿拉伯、印度、巴基斯坦、澳大利亚及纽西兰等国，共同组织“仲裁委员会”赴印尼实地调查。
    【新华社陕北十二日电】各方讯：在马歇尔积极活动由美国单独出面“调停”印荷争端之时，“世界开发银行”行长麦克劳于五日宣布，美国已答应贷款荷兰一亿九千五百万美元。美国在印尼问题上，使用一面“调停”一面帮助荷兰进行侵略战的毒计，已昭然若揭。在美国此种政策鼓励下，印荷发布停战令已一周，但荷军进攻印尼解放区的战事仍在大规模进行中。据最后消息，破约荷军于六日又在马都拉登陆，并占领该岛首府巴麦加山，爪哇荷军已侵占安巴格尔等处。印尼政府识破美“调停”阴谋后，正领导军民英勇反抗荷军之进攻。
    蒋贼仇视印尼
　  借以献媚美国
    【新华社陕北十二日电】自美国支持荷兰发动侵略战争以来，引起世界爱好民主和平人士的同声抗议，并热烈支援印尼独立自卫运动。但中国卖国贼蒋介石，不仅自己甘充奴仆，且仇视印尼的独立运动，借以献媚其美国主子。蒋记外交部情报司负责人，于六日解释蒋贼对印尼政策时，曾泄露：在印荷冲突发生前，蒋贼就“曾与美英一致”干涉印尼问题。当印荷争端提交安理会讨论时，蒋又暴露了人云也云的奴隶本色。蒋记驻美大使顾维钧向美副国务卿罗维特表示“中国（蒋）与美采取一致步调”。同时，造谣机关中央社曾一再进行污蔑中伤，把印尼人民军的英勇自卫战，描画成“洗劫”、“围困”、“毁灭”华侨的“暴行”，上月二十七日蒋党驻巴城总领事蒋家栋，在其广播演说中竟把残害印尼华侨的责任加诸印尼方面，蒋家特务组织三青团驻三宝珑支部于四日甚至狂吠要求蒋贼出动武力“保护华侨”。蒋贼此种妄举，毒谋造成对印尼不利的舆论，且挑拨我侨胞敌视印尼人民。此种阴谋，值得我印尼侨胞严重警惕。
    【新华社陕北十二日电】巴达维亚讯：印尼共和国总理沙利佛丁于八日晚对印尼人民与华侨作出的演讲，对荷兰帝国主义诬称“印尼迫害华侨”的挑拨阴谋痛予驳斥称：荷兰帝国主义极力欺骗世界人民，企图使人相信共和国人民对华侨含有敌意，并极力造谣挑拨华侨与印尼共和国的关系。沙利佛丁坚信，荷兰帝国主义使华侨与印尼人民互相仇视的圈套决不会成功。并强调说：某些印尼民族败类趁火打劫，伤害华侨生命财产，但不能误为此种罪行系出自印尼全体人民之手。
