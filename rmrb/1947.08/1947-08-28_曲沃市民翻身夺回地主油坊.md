　　Quwo city's poor people seized the oil mill from the landlords and are now operating it themselves. Gong Ziren, a landlord operating in the North Street of Quwo, not only exploited through land ownership, but also relied on his position as the pseudo-Deputy Street Chief during the Japanese and Chiang armies' occupation of Quwo city. Through overt and covert extortion, he turned the hard-earned money of most of the poor people and peddlers in the street into his own wealth, opening an oil mill. He stole over 580 catties of sesame oil from all the residents of the street simply by distributing "salt certificates" and "shopping tokens" and purchasing cooking oil on behalf of the pseudo-Chiang army. He also made it a habit to exploit peddlers by renting houses at high interest rates. In early July, the masses struggled against him once. Hearing that industrial and commercial enterprises would not be struggled against, he buried all his private property in the oil mill. When the movement restarted this time, the masses realized that his oil mill was opened with their exploited money, so they simply confiscated the oil mill and dug out all the property inside. Now, under the leadership of the Farmers' Association, all the workers are working excitedly and tensely. They can produce more than 80 catties of oil every day, and the price per catty is also 100 yuan cheaper than the market price. At the same time, in order to take care of the peddlers, they are also allowed to borrow the small millstones.

　　曲沃市民翻身夺回地主油坊
    【本报太岳二十六日电】曲沃城市贫民，从地主手中夺回油坊，自己经营。曲沃北街经营地主宫子仁，除用土地剥削外，并在日本及蒋军侵占曲沃城时期，仗其伪副街长职位，明暗勒索致将该街大部贫民小贩之血汗，变成自己财富，开设油坊，仅以配“盐本”、“购物木牌”，与伪蒋军代购食油，即盗去全街民众香油五百八十余斤，平时更以出租房子，重利剥削小贩为能事。七月上旬，群众曾向其斗争过一次，他听说不斗争工商业，便将其所有的内产，均埋藏于油坊内，此次运动重起，群众已觉悟到其油坊是剥削自己血汗钱所开的，干脆将油坊没收，内产刨尽。现在农会的领导下，所有工人兴奋紧张的工作着。每天可出油八十余斤，油价每斤亦较市面便宜百元，同时为照顾小贩，并允许借用小磨。
