    Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, August 8th: The result of Chiang Kai-shek's launching of the anti-people civil war has greatly damaged coal production in the main coal-producing areas of Northeast and North China, directly and seriously threatening the supply of major cities in Central and South China. Shanghai's coal consumption currently requires approximately 216,000 tons per month, but the supply is still insufficient. Taking May as an example, only 100,000 tons were shipped from Taiwan and Huainan, and even with the coal reserves from April, there were not enough than 190,000 tons. Moreover, this amount must also supply cities along the Beijing-Shanghai, Tianjin-Pukou, and Zhejiang-Jiangxi lines. In order to cope with this severe coal shortage, the Chiang government convened a coal production increase meeting on the 1st. Chen Qitian, the Economic Minister of the Chiang regime and a political beggar from the Youth Party, said helplessly: "Coal mine transportation in North China and Northeast China is difficult and cannot supply Beijing and Shanghai." Zhang then lamented, "This year's coal production is insufficient by as much as six million tons." In response to this, the Shanghai Economic Weekly, published not long ago, commented: "The rice shortage has not yet passed, and the coal shortage is about to come. If the civil war continues, everything will be destroyed, and everyone will feel the panic of scarcity. This is all brought about by the warmongers themselves."
    Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, August 8th: According to a report in the Tianjin Ta Kung Pao on the 21st of last month: In Henan Province, south of the Yellow River, from Zhongmu in the east to Sishui in the west, and Zheng County in the south, the summer wheat harvest was poor, and the autumn crops could not be sown at all due to two months of no rain, resulting in a drought disaster. The Chiang government not only does not help the people prevent drought or provide relief, but instead harasses and plunders them to its heart's content. The families of the Chiang soldiers in Anyang and Jiaozuo, who were evacuated due to fear of the People's Liberation Army's powerful offensive, have successively moved into the disaster area, forcibly occupying civilian houses for as long as twenty li. New houses that have not yet been completed are being forcibly occupied by Chiang soldiers and their families. In Zheng County alone, the "requisition" compensation for fodder in June amounted to 1.5 billion yuan in Chiang currency. Recently, the Chiang military station and the county government have forcibly purchased 500,000 jin of hay at extremely low prices, and required it to be paid in full within seven days. The people in the area are suffering from both natural disasters and Chiang's calamity, and their suffering is unspeakable.

    蒋区严重煤荒
    南京官员手足无措
    【新华社陕北八日电】蒋介石发动反人民内战的结果，使主要产煤区之东北、华北煤炭生产大受破坏，而直接严重威胁华中、华南各大城市之供应。现上海用煤每月约需二十一万六千吨，但供应还感不足，以五月份为例，仅由台湾及淮南运到十万吨，连四月份存煤还不足十九万吨，且此尚须供应京沪、津浦、浙赣沿线诸城市。蒋政府为应付此严重煤荒，于一日召开煤炭增产会议，蒋记经济部长、政治乞丐青年党陈启天手足无措的说：“华北、东北煤矿运输困难，不能供应京沪。”张则哀鸣“本年煤产量不敷达六百万吨。”对此，不久以前之出版之沪经费周报评称：“米荒尚未过去，煤荒又将来临，内战再继续下去，一切都要破坏，一切都要感到缺乏的恐慌，这乏是好战者自己招致的。”
    【新华社陕北八日电】据天津大公报上月二十一日消息：豫省黄河南岸，东到中牟，西到汜水，南迄郑县一带，夏麦歉收，秋禾因两月无雨根本未下种，旱灾已成。蒋政府不但不帮助人民防旱或予以救济，反尽情加以骚扰和搜刮。由于惧怕人民解放军强大攻势而疏散的安阳、焦作蒋军眷属，均先后迁入该灾区内，强占民房长达二十里，新盖民房还未完工，便被蒋军蒋眷强迫迁入。仅草料一项，郑县在六月份已因将蒋方“征购”赔价达十五亿元蒋币，近日蒋兵站部及该县县府又以极低之价格，强购干草五十万斤，并限七天缴齐，该区人民遭受天灾蒋祸夹击，苦不堪言。
