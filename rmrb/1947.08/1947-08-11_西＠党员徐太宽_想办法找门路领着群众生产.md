Xi＠Party Member Xu Taikuan
　　Seeks Ways to Lead the Masses in Production

　　[Reported by our newspaper in Shexian] Comrade Xu Taikuan, a party member from Xi＠ in the Seventh District who is supported by the masses, has become more active and responsible in his work since going public, and his concept of serving the masses has greatly improved. Particularly encouraged by the upsurge of the "Establish Merits for the People" campaign, he actively engages in production for self-salvation and seeks production opportunities for the masses. He said, "Communist Party members should consider the masses in everything and find more ways to avoid letting the masses go hungry because of the disaster." When the masses were worried about the lack of rain and could not think of a solution, the branch committee discussed solutions. He first proposed organizing the masses to sell their labor in Shanxi. Everyone thought this was a good approach. He even mobilized party members to go back and mobilize and organize the masses. Under the leadership of the party members, forty-six laborers were organized to sell their labor in Shanxi within two days. Because he is disabled and cannot lead in person, he mobilized the masses to gather wild vegetables. At first, the masses said, "We were injured by eating too much in good years," showing ideological resistance. He first mobilized his wife to set an example and then convened a mass meeting for education, summarizing the experience of surviving the famine in 1942 and 1943 (wild vegetables can save lives). After the masses' thinking was cleared, they shouted on the spot, "We must listen to the Communist Party and fight against the drought." Comrade Xu led the masses of the whole village to collect 4,000 catties of vegetables a day. He also personally went to Mata Village in Pingshun to rely on foot to organize the transportation of the masses, so that the remaining animal power found a way out, and temporarily summarized the achievements, educating the masses and encouraging the masses to fight against the disaster.
　　His spirit of actively considering the masses has won the support of the masses. Fourteen emancipated peasants, under his influence, became enlightened and requested to join the Communist Party, expanding the Party's good influence among the masses. Moreover, under the promotion of his practical spirit of always considering the masses and his democratic style of consulting with the masses in everything, the work style of many cadres has also been greatly improved. All cadres and party members unanimously proposed to learn from Comrade Xu Taikuan. (Lan Bang, Zhi Dong, Chun Fang)

    他积极为群众打算的精神，得到群众的拥护，十四个翻身农民在他的影响下觉悟起来，要求参加了共产党，扩大了党在群众中的好影响，并且在他时刻为群众打算的实干精神，和凡事给群众商量的民主作风的推动下，使不少干部的作风也大有改进，全体干部和党员都一致提出要向徐太宽同志学习。（兰榜、之栋、春芳）
