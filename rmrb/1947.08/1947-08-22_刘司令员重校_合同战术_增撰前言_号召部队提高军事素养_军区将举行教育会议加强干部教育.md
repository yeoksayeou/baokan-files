　　Authoritative military strategist General Liu Bocheng, last winter, amidst his busy military schedule, revised the lower part of "Combined Tactics," and its publication has already played a significant role in improving the troops' tactics. From actual combat experience, the General also felt that our commanders needed to carefully study battle formations, fire organization, battle command, and be familiar with the performance of special forces and the coordinated skills of combined arms. After the People's Liberation Army's 20th anniversary and the great victory in southwestern Shandong on August 1st of this year, he completed the revision of the upper part of "Combined Tactics," which he had personally revised in 1942, and had it reprinted. This important military document will ignite a wave of learning among all army cadres and further enhance the combat effectiveness of our army.

　　The General added a "Foreword" to the book, providing specific guidance on how cadres should study Chairman Mao's military theories, and succinctly summarized certain tactical issues from the War of Self-Defense. The Foreword first clarified that we must learn warfare from warfare, requiring that we study our own actual battle examples on the one hand, and learn from general military theories on the other, criticizing empiricism and dogmatism in learning. First, it analyzed the laws of war, pointing out that whether the enemy's all-out offensive in the early stages of the war, or their subsequent shift to a focused offensive after setbacks, or even their future retreat and contraction into an all-out focused defense, they are all bound to be fragmented and even collapse under the authority of the People's Liberation Army's consistent method of annihilation. Third, addressing the general weaknesses of the troops, it specifically emphasized the role of reconnaissance, and quoted Chairman Mao's great teaching: "The commander's correct deployment comes from correct determination, correct determination comes from correct judgment, and correct judgment comes from thorough and necessary reconnaissance..." to inspire everyone to value investigation and research. Fourth, it requires commanders to conduct active and flexible maneuvers according to changes in the situation within a certain plan, and cites some battle examples of our army's mobile annihilation of the enemy after the enemy implemented focused defense and focused attacks this year to illustrate this point. At the same time, it opposes mistaking flexibility for reckless action and the mechanical tactics of fighting head-on. Fifth, it pointed out the importance of coordinated actions and communication between various units and arms of service, and that commanders should be well-versed in the performance of special arms, just as farmers are familiar with various farm tools, crops, climate, and soil, in order to organize productive farming. It pointed out that the guarantee of coordinated action relies primarily on sound vertical and horizontal communication.

　　The upper part of "Combined Tactics" is currently being reprinted and will be published and distributed to various units as basic military learning materials for cadres at all levels. The "Foreword" is designated by the military region as a military study document for senior and high-level cadres and has been specially published as a separate booklet and distributed to various units.

　　[本报特讯] According to the current needs of the large-scale development of the troops, the Jin-Ji-Lu-Yu Military Region believes that strengthening the education of in-service cadres and cultivating a large number of cadres should be the central link in future educational work and an important construction in the military region's work. For this reason, the military region has decided to convene an education conference on October 10th, gathering chiefs of staff of various military regions and columns, heads of propaganda and training departments, and responsible cadres for military and political education in military and political schools at all levels, mainly to solve two problems: (1) Strengthening the leadership of military and political schools, training teams, rotational training teams, and special technology training classes at all levels, and improving the learning of in-service cadres; (2) Implementing the mass line and unified leadership in troop education. It has now issued orders to various units to make full preparations, widely solicit opinions from the masses, interview typical events, and make systematic summaries in order to exchange and summarize experiences at the meeting. The military region has also sent cadres to various units to understand the specific situation and complete pre-conference preparations. (Wang Wenzhi)

　　刘司令员重校“合同战术”增撰前言
  　号召部队提高军事素养
    军区将举行教育会议加强干部教育
    【本报特讯】权威军事家刘伯承将军，曾于去冬在戎马倥偬中校成“合同战术”下部，出版后对部队战术的提高，已起巨大作用。将军于实战中，又感到我军指挥员有悉心研究战斗队形、火力组织、战斗指挥及熟悉特种兵性能、联合兵权协同技巧之必要。复于今年八月一日人民解放军二十周年完成鲁西南大歼灭战之后，将其一九四二年亲校之“合同战术”上部，完成重校工作，再版付印。这一重要军事文件，将激起全军干部的学习热潮，更加提高我军的战斗力。
    将军对斯书增撰“前言”，具体指导干部学习毛主席军事学说的方法，扼要的总结了自卫战争中某些战术问题。前言中首先阐明要从战争中学习战争，要求一方面学习我军自己的实际战例，另一方面应向一般的军事理论学习，批判了学习中的经验主义与教条主义。第一、是分晰了战争的规律，指出无论敌人在战争初期的全面攻势也好，受挫后接着变为重点攻势也好，甚至今后的撤退收缩为全面的重点防御也好，都必然在人民解放军贯穿全局的歼灭战法的权威下，趋于支离破碎，以至溃灭。第三、针对着部队一般的弱点，特别提出侦察的作用，并引用毛主席伟大的教言：“指挥员正确部署，来源于正确的决心，正确的决心来源于正确的判断，正确的判断来源于周到的与必要的侦察……。”以启发大家对调查研究的重视。第四、要求指挥员在一定计划上，应根据情况的变化进行主动的灵活的机动，并引证了今年敌人实行重点防御与重点攻击后，被我机动歼敌的一些战例，以资说明。同时，反对了把灵活误为妄动和机械的硬从正面斗牛的战术。第五、指出各部队各兵种协同动作与通信连络的重要性，指挥员应深谙特种兵性能，譬之农民对各种农具、耕作物、气候、土壤的熟悉，才能组织有收成的农事一样。指出协同动作的保证，首赖于建全的纵横的通信连络。
    “合同战术”上部一书，正在再版印刷中，不日出版，分发各部做为各级干部军事基本学习教材。其“前言”，军区规定为上干及高干军事学习文件，已专刊单行本分发各部。（王文治）
    【本报特讯】晋冀鲁豫军区根据目前部队大量发展之需要，认为加强在职干部教育、培养大批干部，应为今后教育工作之中心环节及军区工作中之重要建设。为此，军区决定于十月十日召集各军区、纵队、参谋长、宣教训练部门负责人，及各级军政学校之军政教育负责干部，举行教育会议，主要解决两个问题：（一）加强对各级军政学校、教导队、轮训队、特科训练班的领导，及提高在职干部学习问题，（二）贯澈部队教育之群众路线，及一元化领导问题。现已分令各部，作充分准备，广泛在群众中征求意见，采访典型事迹，做系统之整理总结，以便届期到会交流与总结经验。军区亦已分派干部到各部了解具体情况，完成会前准备事宜。（王文治）
