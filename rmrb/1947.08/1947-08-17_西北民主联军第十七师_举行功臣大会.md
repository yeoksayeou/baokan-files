    [Report from this newspaper] The 17th Division of the 38th Army of the Northwest Democratic Allied Army convened a meritorious heroes convention on the 29th of last month in a certain location. Division Commander Zhang called on everyone, saying, "Meritorious heroes should learn from each other, exchange experiences, and play the role of a locomotive, leading all comrades forward!"

In the afternoon, meritorious heroes held group discussions to exchange experiences. The next day, meritorious heroes Song Jincai, Li Shoushen, and others gave typical reports.

The meritorious heroes were in high spirits and immediately brewed a wave of meritorious service, vying to announce their plans to perform meritorious service. The plan of Special Class Meritorious Hero Wang Xuesheng's class is to capture five enemy soldiers, seize one machine gun, and five rifles in the second half of the year. Song Cai's plan reads: "I will not return home until Chiang Kai-shek is defeated. I will not be proud of my meritorious service, but humbly learn and cultivate a combat hero. I will capture three enemy soldiers and seize three guns in battle." On the afternoon of the third day, awards were given. Eight special class meritorious heroes, including Song Jincai, Wang Xuesheng, Li Shoushen, Ding Qiuqiu, Wei Fuyuan, Shang Wenming, Zhang Xuewu, and Zheng Fu, were awarded prizes such as silk vests with the title "People's Meritorious Hero".
