　　Lambsquarters·Noodle Soup Laundry Alternative to Soap
    [This Newspaper] In production and frugality, there are two laundry methods that are both economical and hygienic: 1. Lambsquarters (a wild vegetable) contains a type of nitrate and alkaline substance, which is excellent for removing dirt from clothes. There are two ways to use it: (1) While washing, apply the lambsquarters directly onto the clothes and rub vigorously. The clothes will turn green. Rinse with clean water and expose to sunlight, and they will become snow-white. (2) Uproot the lambsquarters, boil them in water, and use the water to wash clothes, which is even better.
    2. Noodle soup is a starchy substance. When it mixes with dirt, it can lift the grime. A gentle scrub with your hands will clean the clothes. Adding alkaline powder to the noodle soup will make it even more effective. The benefit of noodle soup is that it can remove dirt and won't damage the clothes. After everyone has eaten noodles, soak the clothes in the noodle soup for an hour before washing them, then rinse twice with water. They will be stiff when dry, but this is not a bad thing. This method has been used many times, saving both effort and soap. (Liang Yu)

　　灰菜·面汤洗衣顶肥皂
    【本报讯】在生产节约中有两种既省钱又能保证卫生的洗衣办法：一、灰菜（野菜）上含有一种硝、碱性，洗衣服最起垢，他的用法有两种：（一）用水一面洗就一面把灰菜涂在衣物上，用劲揉一下，衣服就变成绿的，再用清水洗一下，放在太阳光下一晒，就变成了雪白的了；（二）把灰菜拔回家来，熬成水洗衣服更好。
    二、面汤是浆性的东西，当和污垢的东西溶在一起，就能把污泡起来，只要用手轻轻的搓一下就可洗净衣服。如果拿碱面汤那就更好。面汤的好处是能起垢，更不会把衣服洗破，在大家吃了面后，可将衣服用面汤先泡一个钟头再洗，然后用水净两遍，干了是硬的，这并不坏事。这办法已用多次，又省力又省肥皂。（良玉）
