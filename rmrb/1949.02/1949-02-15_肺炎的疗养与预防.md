　　Pneumonia Treatment and Prevention

　　Pneumonia is a relatively common infectious disease in the winter and spring seasons, caused by a germ that enters through the nose or throat. A considerable number of children die from this disease, often occurring after a cold or rash. Therefore, parents should pay special attention to their children contracting this disease and seek prompt medical attention once it is discovered; adults are more likely to develop it from a severe cold.

　　The disease begins with a sudden fever, accompanied by a feeling of coldness on the back, chills, headache, body fever, chest pain, shortness of breath, and coughing up phlegm. The initial phlegm is a mucus, which later turns rust-colored, breathing becomes difficult, and some children may even experience convulsions. When the above symptoms are noticed, the patient should preferably lie on their back on the kang (heated brick bed), with the room slightly warmer, but avoid using charcoal fire to prevent carbon monoxide poisoning. However, care should be taken to prevent the patient from catching a cold; if a stove is used, it is best to sprinkle some water on the ground frequently and put a kettle on the fire to prevent the air in the room from becoming excessively dry. If the patient is short of breath, their upper body can be propped up while lying down, and the patient should be helped to turn over every two or three hours, avoiding excessive movement. If the patient feels chest pain, cooked wheat bran can be placed in a bag and placed on their chest; it is even better to apply a mustard plaster to the chest. Food should be soft and easy to digest. Patients should be isolated from ordinary healthy people, especially children, who should be kept away from pneumonia patients.

　　Children suffering from this disease have a high chance of recovery as long as they can eat. In addition to caring for the patient according to the above methods, quinine injections or oral quinine can be used for medical treatment. People near cities should take the patient to the hospital as soon as possible for special drug injections. If children get this disease, it is very dangerous if not treated in time.

　　Methods to prevent pneumonia are: avoid contact with pneumonia patients; pay attention to wind-cold colds, and if you have already contracted a cold and cough, you should be treated promptly to avoid developing into this disease.

　　肺炎的疗养与预防
    肺炎是冬春季节较为流行的一种传染病，原因是在鼻—或嗓子里侵入了一种病菌而引起的。小儿因染上这种病而死的相当多，往往在伤风或出疹后容易发生。因此，作父母的要特别注意自己的小孩染上这种病，并且在一经发现后，应及时找医生诊治；成年人则多因伤风发展厉害而来的。
    这种病一开始时，突然发热，同时脊背上感觉冷、哆嗦、头疼、身上发烧、胸痛、气短、咯痰。最初的痰是一种黏液，后来变成铁锈色，呼吸感觉困难，有的小儿甚至还有抽风的现象。当发现上述的病状后，患者最好仰首躺在炕上，屋里稍暖和一些，不宜生炭火，以免发生煤气。但应注意不要使患者受寒冷；若生炉时，最好经常洒些水在地上，并坐一水壶在火上，以便防止屋里的空气过渡干燥。病人有气短的现象时，可将他的上半身垫高一些躺着，每两三小时帮助病人翻翻身，不要他多动。若病人感到胸部痛时，可以把炒熟的麸子装在口袋里放在他的胸上，如果能将芥末调成膏药敷在胸上更好。吃东西要软的好消化的。并应将病人和普通好人隔离开，尤其小孩更要注意，不要接近肺炎的病患者。
    患这种病的小儿，只要能吃食物，治好的可能性很大。除照上面的方法护理病人外，医药方面可注射奎宁针或吃奎宁。靠进城市的人，最好赶快把病人送医院，用特效药注射。如果小孩得了此病，不及时治疗，危险性很大。
    预防肺炎的方法是：不要接近肺炎的病患者；注意风寒感冒，若已染上伤风咳嗽的病，即应及时治愈，以免演变成这种病。
