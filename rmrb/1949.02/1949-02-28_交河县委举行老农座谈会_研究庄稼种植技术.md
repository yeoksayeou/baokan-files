【Hebei-Chahar-Hebei-Shandong-Henan News】In order to understand the production situation and production experience of farmers, the Jiaocheng County Party Committee convened a forum with eleven experienced old farmers from four villages on February 5th. At the meeting, the County Party Committee first learned about the production situation at the grassroots level. Chu Yuhen was very happy to say: "Since the land certificates were issued, people have been more at ease with production. Last winter, accumulating fertilizer, collecting manure, and buying agricultural tools showed more effort than in previous years. At the same time, women have also developed production habits, and this year there are conditions for carrying out large-scale production." Others also said that since land rights were determined, people have been investing capital and working hard. Then, the issue of planting techniques was studied. They put forward some experiences and opinions:
	(1) According to the soil quality of these villages in Jiaocheng, it is advisable to use large drills for planting, as the benefits are that the crop seedlings have ventilation and are not hot, are resistant to moisture and drought, and the crops grow strong. (2) The best fertilizer to use is manure, as it ferments and has a strong effect. Use it as base fertilizer for strong seedling growth, and as supplementary fertilizer for strong grain production. (3) The area planted with crops should be expanded. In this area, cotton, peanuts, and sweet potatoes are rarely planted, either because the soil is not suitable or because people are not accustomed to it. This should be greatly promoted today. (4) In recent years, the soil has lacked fertilization efforts, and this year we must mobilize the masses to apply more fertilizer, cultivate carefully, and increase yields.

　　交河县委举行老农座谈会
  　研究庄稼种植技术
    【冀中讯】交河县委为了了解农民生产情况，生产经验，于二月五日召集四个村十一个有经验的老农，举行老农座谈会。在会上县委首先了解了下层生产情况。褚玉很高兴的说：“自从发了土地证以后，人们生产上都安心了。去年冬天积肥拾粪置买农具，显出来的比前几年上劲了。同时妇女们也有了生产习惯，今年开展大生产是有条件搞好的。”别人也都说：自地权确定后，人们都下本钱卖力气了。接着便研究了种植技术问题。他们提出了一些经验和意见：
    （一）根据交河这几个村的土质，耩地宜用大耧，好处是庄稼苗透风不火热，耐湿耐旱庄稼滋长强壮。（二）所用肥料，最好是圈粪，这样粪经过发酵劲头大，作底肥，发苗壮，作补肥，壮粮食。（三）要扩大种植物面积，这个地区对于棉花、花生、山芋种植很少，不是土质不宜，就是人们不习惯。今天应大大提倡。（四）几年来土地的肥料缺欠工夫，今年要发动群众多施肥，精耕细作增加产量。
