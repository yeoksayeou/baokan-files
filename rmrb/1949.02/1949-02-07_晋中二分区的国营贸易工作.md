　　State-Owned Trade Work in Jinzhong Second District
　　Wen Zheng
　　Yufeng Hou is the state-owned trade organization in the Jinzhong Second District, under which are three branches in Xiaoyi, Jiaocheng, and Qingyuan. It was established in September after the liberation of Jinzhong. Over the past four months, under the leadership of the district company and the efforts of all cadres, preliminary achievements have been made in its work. A total of 2,900,1373 jin of grain has been regulated, which, at one jin per person per day, can feed the entire district for more than four days. 366,455 jin of ginned cotton were regulated, still accounting for more than one-quarter of the total cotton production in the district this year. 442,984 bolts of homespun cloth and corduroy were transferred from outside, greatly solving the clothing difficulties of the local people. In terms of prices, a policy of steady price increases was generally maintained. When grain and cotton prices were sluggish after the autumn harvest, the head office absorbed 230,231 jin of grain and 118,509 jin of cotton, appropriately raising the market price at that time. When prices soared last December and this January, it also cooperated with local government and civilian organizations to discuss methods and formulate countermeasures, generally maintaining stable price increases. It protected the legitimate business of private industrial and commercial enterprises, but carried out necessary struggles against speculators and manipulators. In October, when purchasing cotton at the Jicun market, it discovered the destructive phenomenon of private merchants adulterating cotton with water and impurities. In addition to convening meetings to expose this, the cotton was sold at a reduced price. However, due to the increasingly complex environment, some problems have also arisen in the work. I would like to put forward a few points I have observed for everyone to study.

　　First, Commercial Data Work
　　This is the key to leading the market. The head office and branch offices established data sections in October, but they only played the role of registering prices, filling out forms, and reporting, without linking up with the business. They did not understand the general economic situation within their jurisdiction, especially the consumption, output, market trading volume, and import and export quantities, so blindness occurred. They followed the market, which affected our opportunities to control materials. At the same time, there was insufficient contact with upright merchants, so they could not regularly provide us with materials to supplement our strength.

　　Second, the Issue of Controlling and Stabilizing Prices
　　In controlling prices, the main problem at present is the lack of unified strength and inconsistent steps. Some shops run by government agencies and troops are purely for profit, playing a speculative and destructive role. For example, last December, when the main grain market in the second district, Dui Jiu Yu Town, was experiencing cold weather and grain shortages, the Jinhua Goods Station (opened by the troops) was buying large quantities of grain there (according to investigations, 300 shi were bought). When the price of goods in Fenyang soared at the beginning of January this year, the Fenyang Municipal Government immediately convened a meeting of the city's eleven public-owned stores to study methods for stabilizing prices and formulated a plan; however, when a meeting was held on January 20th to check on the implementation, except for Yufeng Hou, which implemented the resolution and sold 220 million yuan (Hebei currency), other agency stores rarely implemented it.

　　Based on the work of the Second District Trade Organization for more than four months, the following points of experience have been gained in controlling prices: (1) It is necessary to concentrate the use of capital and make trade plans in advance based on the season and local trading rules. For example, in the early days of Yufeng Hou's establishment, there were three outlets in Fenyang alone, with more than 80 kinds of slow-moving goods, accounting for 35% of the total capital, which affected the control of cloth, cotton, and grain urgently needed by the masses. After changing this business policy in November, the strength to control prices greatly increased. For example, when grain prices were sluggish last autumn, it was the time for us to collect grain, but due to unclear leadership relations and lack of funds, although some were absorbed in the later period, merchants were given many opportunities for speculation. Therefore, it is very important to concentrate capital, make trade plans on a grounded basis, and organize manpower and capital to control physical objects. (2) When state-owned stores sell goods, they must also be well planned and organized, and the power of local public-owned stores must be carefully supervised and used. Such as what to sell, how to sell, etc. According to the experience of the head office and Xiaoyi branch, if you do not organize a plan in advance when selling goods, it will not only fail to stabilize prices, but will also cause chaos in the sales process (such as some merchants buying double or even triple portions, and some buying very little or none at all); at the same time, try to sell directly to the masses and implement retail sales, so as to avoid merchants exploiting again. (3) It is necessary to cooperate with the government in market management. Due to the relaxation of market management in Dui Town, the phenomenon of private grain merchants trading privately has been created, which not only caused prices to soar, but also resulted in serious tax evasion. When our state-owned organs and the tax bureau in the area studied methods for managing the market and suppressed the manipulation of private merchants, it was welcomed by the masses.

　　Third, All Aspects Urgently Need to Be Unified
　　Now, in the competition with private merchants, our biggest loophole is the lack of unified leadership and inconsistent steps. This is not only manifested in the phenomenon of public-owned enterprises competing to purchase, but also in the relationship with state-owned stores. For example, there have been many uncoordinated phenomena in the transfer of cadres; each public-owned store also has its own opinions on the use of merchants and peddlers, which are not unified. Some cadres do not have a comprehensive and in-depth understanding of the policy of protecting industry and commerce, and are not resolute in fighting speculative merchants. For example, after Yufeng Hou discovered the grain merchant in Fenyang He Shazi adulterating bad rice, they only called him in for an individual conversation. A tax cadre in Xiaoyi also wavered when he saw that private merchants were dissatisfied with the management of the market in Dui Town, "Oh, isn't this destroying the policy of protecting industry and commerce!" This right-leaning thought urgently needs to be corrected.

　　晋中二分区的国营贸易工作
    文正
    裕丰厚是晋中二分区的国营贸易机关，下辖孝义、交城、清源等三个分店，是晋中解放后九月间成立的。四个月来在区公司的领导和全体干部的努力下，在工作上获得初步的成绩，共计调剂了粮食二百九十万零一千三百七十三斤，每人每天以一斤计，可供全分区群众吃四天余。调剂了皮棉三十六万六千四百五十五斤，仍占全分区今年出棉总数的四分之一强。从外调进土布码子布四十四万二千九百八十四匹，大大解决了本地群众的穿衣困难。在物价上，一般掌握了稳升稳涨的物价政策，于秋后粮棉价疲时，总店吸收了二十三万零二百三十一斤粮食，和十一万八千五百零九斤棉花，适当的提高了当时的市价。去年十二月及今年一月物价狂涨时，又协同当地政民机关讨论了办法，制定了对策，一般的保持了物价的稳升。对私营工商业，保护了他们合法营业，但对投机操纵的商人，予以必要的斗争。十月在冀村市上购棉时，发现了私商掺水掺假的破坏现象，他们除召开会议进行了揭发外，并予低价售出。但因环境的日趋复杂，工作中也发生了一些问题，兹将我所看到的几点提出供大家研究。
    第一、商业资料工作
    这是领导市场的钥匙。十月份总店与分店先后成立了资料股，但仅仅起了登记物价填表汇报的作用，与业务联系不起来。没有了解所属范围内的一般经济情况，特别是消费量，出产量，市场交易量及出入口数量，所以就发生了盲目性，跟着市场跑，以致影响到我们掌握物资的机会。同时和正派的商人联系不够，不能使他们时常供给我们材料，以补力量的不足。
    第二、掌握和稳定物价问题
    在掌握物价上，目前主要是力量不统一，步调不一致的问题。机关部队所经营的商店，有些是专以营利为目的，起了投机破坏作用。如去年十二月，二分区的主要粮食市场兑九峪镇正当天冷粮缺时，晋华货栈（部队开的）却在那里大量购粮（据调查买了三百石）。今年一月初汾阳物价暴涨时，汾阳市府立刻召开了该市十一家公营商店会议，研究稳价办法，并制定了计划；但一月二十日又开会检查时，除裕丰厚照决议执行，抛售了二亿二千万元（冀钞下同）物资外，其他机关商店很少执行。
    根据二分区贸易机关四个多月的工作，在掌握物价上得出了如下几点经验：（一）要集中资力的使用，根据季节和当地交易规律，事先作出贸易计划，如裕丰厚在成立初期，只汾阳即设有三个门市部，有八十多种冷背货，占了全部资本的百分之三十五，影响到群众迫切需要的布棉粮的掌握，十一月改变了这种营业方针后，即增加了很大掌握物价的力量。又如去秋粮价疲时，正为我收粮时间，但由于领导关系不明确，没有资金，虽后期也吸收了些，但已给了商人很多投机的机会。所以集中资力，有根据地作出贸易计划，组织好人力资力，掌握实物是很重要的。（二）在国营商店抛售物资时，也必须很好的计划、组织，认真监督使用当地公营商店的力量。如抛售什么，怎么抛售等。总店和孝义分店经验，在抛售物资时，如不事先组织计划好，不但起不到稳价的作用，反会造成抛售中的混乱现象（如一些商人买双份甚至三份，有的就很少买到或买不到）；同时要尽可能直接售给群众，施行零销，以免商人再次剥削。（三）要协同政权进行市场管理。兑镇由于对市场放松了管理，曾造成粮商私自交易的现象，不仅使物价暴涨，而且漏税很严重。当我该地国营机关与税务局研究了管理市场办法，抑制了私商的操纵后，即受到群众欢迎。
    第三、各方面都急待统一
    现在与私商竞争中，我们的一个最大漏洞，就是领导不统一，步调不一致。这不仅表现在公营间有争购现象，而且在对国营商店的关系上也有问题。如调干部，就发生了很多的不协调现象；在各公营商店使用商贩上也各有己见，不统一。有些干部对保护工商业政策了解不全面，不深刻，对投机商人斗争不坚决。如裕丰厚在发现了汾阳合沙子掺坏米的粮商后，只叫去个别谈了谈话，孝义一个税收干部在见到兑镇管理市场为私商不满时，他自己也动摇了，“唉呀！这不是破坏了保护工商业的政策么！”这种右倾思想急待纠正。
