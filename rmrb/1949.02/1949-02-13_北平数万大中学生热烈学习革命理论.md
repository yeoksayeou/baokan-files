　　Xinhua News Agency, Beiping, 11th: Tens of thousands of college and middle school students in Beiping after liberation are enthusiastically studying revolutionary theory and freely organizing various social activities. Although it is winter vacation now, the major colleges and middle schools in Beiping are crowded with students. They can now openly rush to produce propaganda materials. Colorful slogans and portraits are flying everywhere in the city of Beiping. Twisting the Yangko is no longer considered a "dangerous" thing. The sound of gongs and drums is endless all day long, and students are teaching the workers in the city to twist the Yangko. Mao Zedong's "On New Democracy" and the New China News Agency's New Year's Day editorial "Carry the Revolution Through to the End" are being reproduced in large quantities. Group discussions have become the main way for students to learn. Students are very concerned about the development of the current situation. Peking University held a current affairs symposium, where professors such as Qian Duansheng, Fan Hong, and Xu Deheng gave speeches on the eight peace conditions proposed by the Communist Party of China. More than 10,000 students attended. Students who used to bury themselves in books have also come out to participate in activities. 95% of the students from Tsinghua and Yenching universities participate in collective life. Students of China University, who have long been oppressed by Kuomintang secret agents and bandits, feel the joy of liberation even more deeply. They have established more than 20 associations and freely participate in various progressive activities. The Beiping Student Federation for Celebrating the Liberation of Beiping, which includes 107 units and represents 70,000 college and middle school students, was officially established on the 1st. It is now being led by 13 resident schools, including Peking University, Tsinghua University, Yenching University, Normal University, Northeast University, Sino-French University, Railway Management College, Huiwen Middle School, and Baiman Girls' Middle School, to mobilize, organize, publicize, and study among college and middle school students throughout the city.

　　北平数万大中学生热烈学习革命理论
    【新华社北平十一日电】解放后的北平数万大、中学生，正在热烈地学习革命理论和自由地组织各种社会活动。现在虽是寒假期内，北平各大、中学校内都挤满了学生。他们现在可以公开地赶制宣传品了。彩色的标语、画像，在北平城内到处飞扬。扭秧歌也不再被认为“危险”的事。锣鼓声成天不绝，学生们正在教市内的职工们扭秧歌。毛主席的“新民主主义论”和今年元旦新华社“将革命进行到底”的社论正被大量地复印着。小组讨论已成了学生们学习的主要方式。学生们非常关心时局的发展。北京大学曾召开时事座谈会，由钱端升、樊弘、许德珩等教授分别讲演中国共产党所提出的八项和平条件，听讲学生达一万余人。一向钻在书本子里的学生也都出来参加活动了。清华、燕京两校同学参加集体生活的有百分之九十五。久遭国民党特务匪徒压迫的中国大学学生，更深感解放的欢快。他们已经成立了二十多个社团，自由地参加各种进步的活动。包括一百零七个单位，代表七万大中学生的北平市学生庆祝北平解放联合会，于一日正式成立后，现正由北京大学、清华大学、燕京大学、师范大学、东北大学、中法大学、铁道管理学院、汇文中学、贝满女中等十三个驻会学校，担负起领导全市大中学生的动员、组织、宣传、学习工作。
