　　Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, February 19th: TASS, Moscow, February 15th: The newspaper "Izvestia" published an article by Maduyev entitled "The Marshall Plan and American Monopoly Capital," which stated:

　　The economy of Western European countries has been led to a dead end by the Marshall Plan. While the living standards of both Marshallized countries and the American working people are declining, the profits of American companies are increasing. In 1948, American companies' profits were unprecedentedly huge, increasing by 34% compared to 1947. Since the implementation of the Marshall Plan, American monopoly capital has dumped large quantities of American goods that it cannot sell elsewhere into the Western European market, thereby maintaining high prices and thus maintaining high profits.

　　Of the total amount of goods imported into West Germany from April to October 1948 under the Marshall Plan, the largest proportion came from dollar countries, primarily the United States (56.6%). The various goods forced upon them by American exporters have created situations such as Belgium being forced to buy 250,000 tons of American wheat at twice the price of the European market for five years. American exporters hoped to obtain an excess profit of 1.5 billion francs (Belgian currency) from this transaction alone. Many Marshallized countries have had to import coal from the United States at prices much higher than those in the European market.

　　The "bilateral" agreements signed between the United States and European countries stipulate that 50% of the goods under the Marshall Plan must be transported by American ships, from which American companies reap huge profits. The recipient countries could have saved $650 million in freight if they had used non-American ships, as American ship freight is $4.50 per ton higher than that of other countries. As a result, in the first six months of the Marshall Plan (i.e., from April to October 1948), American shipping companies earned a profit of $243 million, which is 12% of the total "aid" funds.

　　Recently, due to the American arms race, the issue of stockpiling so-called strategic raw materials has become increasingly important. In this regard, the institutions of the Marshall Plan are also faithfully serving Wall Street. American companies are using the very favorable terms in the "aid" agreements in Western Europe, according to which the recipient countries must immediately supply strategic raw materials to the United States as soon as they receive a request from the United States. It should be pointed out that the shipment of raw materials from Western Europe to the United States is underway, without any consideration for the needs of the war-damaged economies of Western European countries. When the shortage of metals in Western European countries (less than 2 million tons last year) has become a major obstacle to the recovery of European industry, American companies are using the Marshall Plan to transport approximately 200,000 tons of scrap metal from West Germany, and will transport even larger quantities.

　　The tactics of the American import and export companies take various forms. But despite the huge profits already made, American financial and industrial magnates still believe that the level of "reasonable profit" has not been reached. At their insistence, more forceful measures are being taken to encourage private investment abroad. The "Economic Cooperation Administration" has received many applications requesting that American capital be invested in many key sectors of Western European industry.

　　However, the determination of the masses of people in Marshallized countries to not allow their countries to become colonies of American monopoly capital is growing. There is no doubt that the people will be able to crush the plans of those who are once again attempting to seize "leadership of world affairs."

　　马歇尔计划与美国独占资本
    【新华社陕北十九日电】塔斯社莫斯科十五日讯：消息报发表马杜耶夫的论文，题为“马歇尔计划与美国独占资本”，内称：
    西欧国家的经济，已被马歇尔计划引到了绝路。当马歇尔化国家与美国本国劳动人民的生活水平均在下降之际，美国公司的利润却在增大中。一九四八年，美国公司的利润空前巨大，较一九四七年增加了百分之三十四。自马歇尔计划实施以来，美国独占资本就把在其他地方卖不出去的美国货大量倾入西欧市场，藉以保持高昂物价，从而保持了高额利润。
    依照马歇尔计划而于一九四八年四月到十月输入西德的货物总额中，最大部分属于美元国家，首先是美国（百分之五十六点六）。美国出口商所强运来的各种货物造成这样的形势，例如，比利时被迫在五年内以较欧洲市场高一倍的价格购买美国小麦二十五万吨。美国出口商仅仅从这一笔买卖中，就希望获得十五亿法郎（比利时币名）的超额利润。不少马歇尔化的国家，不得不以大大高于欧洲市场的价格自美国输入煤炭。
    美国与欧洲国家签订的“双边”协定，规定马歇尔计划的货物，百分之五十需由美国船只运送，美国公司从这一规定中获取巨额利润。受“援”国如以非美国船只运货，原可节省运费六亿五千万美元，因为美船运费较他国船只每吨高四元五角美金。结果，在马歇尔计划施行后的头六个月（即一九四八年四月至十月），美国轮船公司就获得了二亿四千三百万美元的利润，这为全部“援助”经费的百分之十二。
    最近，由于美国的军备竞赛，囤积所谓战略原料的问题，有日益增长的重要性。在这方面，马歇尔计划的机构也正在忠心耿耿地为华尔街服役。美国公司正在西欧利用“援助”协定中极有利的条款，依照这种条款，受“援”国一接到美国的要求，就不得不马上将战略原料供给美国。应当指出，自西欧运送原料至美国一事正在进行中，此举毫不考虑受到战争破坏的西欧国家经济的需要。当西欧国家之缺乏金属（去年不足二百万吨）成为恢复欧洲工业的主要阻碍时，美国公司却藉助于马歇尔计划，而自西德运走碎金属约二十万吨，并且还会运走更大数量。
    美国进出口公司的计策，采取各种不同的形式。但是，尽管已有了巨大的利润，美国金融与工业大亨们还认为：“合理利润”的水平尚未达到。在他们的坚持之下，正采取更有力的措施，以鼓励私人在国外投资。“经济合作总署”收到了很多申请书，要求把美国资本投于西欧工业的很多主要部门。
    然而，马歇尔化国家的人民大众，不允许将他们的国家变成美国独占资本的殖民地的决心正在增长。毫无疑问，人民一定能粉碎新的妄图攫取“世界军务的领导权”者的计划。
