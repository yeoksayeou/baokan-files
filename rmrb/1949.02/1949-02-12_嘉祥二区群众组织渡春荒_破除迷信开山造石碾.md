[Ji Lu Yu Telegram] The masses in the Second District of Jiaxiang are organizing to overcome the famine by opening up mountains and manufacturing stone mills on a large scale. Acheng Mountain near Achengpu Village in the Second District has high-quality stone and can produce a large number of stone mills. In the past, the mountain was controlled by feudal landlords such as Zeng Hanlin and Wang Bingli of Achengpu, who suppressed the masses by claiming that the mountain was "controlled by the earth god" and was "Wang family's feng shui land," preventing them from quarrying. In 1926 and 1938, Wang Zhengwen and other poor people in the village secretly made several millstones, but were beaten and scolded by the landlords, and Wang Zhengwen was forced to flee. The landlords even erected a stone tablet in front of the mountain: "Never allow moving the stones on the mountain." Since then, no one dared to open up the mountain. Last autumn's flood was severe, and the autumn grain harvest was reduced. Most of the masses felt it difficult to live and thought about fleeing the famine. The district government called on the masses to engage in production for self-salvation, organizing to open up the mountains and make millstones. However, at the beginning, the masses still had superstitious concerns about feng shui. With the firm support of the government, widespread propaganda was carried out to break superstition. After the masses resolved their ideological concerns, Han Guixue and Li Pixian of Achengpu actively coordinated and brewed the idea, and within five days, they connected 283 masses from eight villages who had nothing to eat. They immediately organized a stonemasons' association and elected eight people as members to lead the opening of the mountain. After the opening of the mountain, the landlords carried out several acts of sabotage, but they were all exposed by the masses. After the start of construction, 280 millstones have been opened in eight days. In order to prevent the sabotage of the landlords, the stonemasons also organized their own armed forces (a total of eight guns) to be responsible for covering the work of opening the mountain. The organization of the stonemasons is based on the division of labor in the stone ponds, with a leader and deputy leader for each stone pond, the large ones with 23 people and the small ones with 15 people. It is estimated that if there is no delay, 80 millstones can be produced every day. At present, the number of people opening the mountain is increasing day by day. It is estimated that this mountain can accommodate 5,000 people, which can guarantee that more than 30 villages of poor people will not go hungry. If the business promotion work is carried out, it can be used by 20,000 people. At present, there are more than 300 millstones of various kinds piled up. According to the district government's review: the leadership of this work is not enough in political education, and superstitious ideas have not been completely eradicated. If a stone hits a person, some people still believe in ghosts and gods. It is decided to strengthen education in the future and help with promotion.

　　嘉祥二区群众组织渡春荒
  　破除迷信开山造石碾
    【冀鲁豫电】嘉祥二区群众组织起来，大量开山制造石碾，战胜灾荒。二区阿城铺村附近的阿城山，石头质量很好，能产大量的石碾。该山过去被阿城铺封建地主曾汉林、王秉礼等所统治，以该山是“地主管”、是“王家风水地”之说，压制群众不让开。民国十五年、二十七年，两次有本村穷人王政文等偷打了几盘碾，均受到地主的打骂，王政文被逼的逃了荒。并让穷人在山前立上石碑：“永不准动山上的石头”。从此就再无人敢开这个山了。去秋水灾严重秋粮减收、多数群众感到生活困难而想着逃荒。区政府就号召生产自救，组织起来开山打碾。但开始群众仍有迷信风水的顾虑，经政府坚决支持，对破除迷信进行了广泛宣传。群众解决思想顾虑后，又经阿城铺的韩贵学、李丕先二人积极串通酝酿，在五天中，便串通了八个村没啥吃的群众共二百八十三人，当即组织起石工会，并选出八人为委员，领导开山。在进行开山以后，地主又几次进行破坏，但均被群众所揭发。开工后，八天时间已开出二百八十盘碾。石工们为了防止地主的破坏，更组织了自己的武装（共八支枪），负责掩护开山工作。石工中的组织是按石塘分工，每一石塘设一正副组长，大的二十三人，小的十五人。预计如不误工，每天能出八十盘碾。目前开山人数日益扩大，估计此山能容五千人，能保证三十余村贫苦群众不挨饿。如将营业推销工作搞起来，计可用到两万人。现堆积各种碾三百余盘，据区政府检讨：对这一工作的领导，政治教育不够，迷信思想还未彻底根除。如有一次石头碰着人后，仍有人相信有鬼有神。决定今后要加强教育，并帮助推销。
