Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 13th. Tokyo Dispatch: Since the Japanese House of Representatives election on January 23rd, the struggle between the progressive and reactionary camps in Japan has been extremely fierce.

	On the progressive side, after initiating the movement to organize a People's Democratic United Front, the Japanese Communist Party (JCP) is still working to achieve this goal. On the 7th, Tokuda Kyuichi, Secretary-General of the JCP, declared at a press conference held by Communist Party members of parliament: "The Communist Party will, wherever possible, conduct the struggle against monopoly capital jointly with the Labor-Farmer Party, the Socialist Party, and other mass organizations" (Reuters). Although the JCP's thirteen-point proposal for Japan's independence and democratization was rejected by the Socialist Party leadership, it has been supported by the broad masses of the people. Organized workers represented by the Federation of Industrial Labor Unions, lower-level Socialist Party members represented by Hokkaido Socialist Party members, and progressive intellectuals represented by the Anti-Fascist Intellectuals' Congress all support the organization of this People's Democratic Front. The influence of the JCP is continuing to increase. According to Reuters, eleven members of the Socialist Party and the Labor-Farmer Party, including eight executive committee members of the Ishikawa Prefecture labor union in central Honshu, joined the JCP at a joint meeting of the three parties held in Kanazawa, the prefecture, on the 9th. Tokuda announced on the 7th that "the key points of the JCP's program are to resolutely oppose conservative parties" (Reuters). The JCP organization has now filed lawsuits and accusations against a group of Democratic Liberal Party members of parliament for electoral fraud.

	On the reactionary side, the Democratic Liberal Party, which governs under MacArthur's protection, is intensifying its activities to unite Japanese reactionary forces on the one hand and intensifying its preparations to attack democratic forces in Japan on the other. Democratic Liberal Party leader Yoshida Shigeru has repeatedly discussed the issue of organizing a joint reactionary cabinet with Democratic Party leader Inukai Ken, but they have failed to unite so far due to the struggle for power and profit. Currently, the Democratic Liberal Party is engaged in organizing an isolated one-party reactionary cabinet. In order to suppress democratic forces, in addition to ordering the prohibition of trade unions from engaging in political activities and secretly preparing to revise the Labor Standards Law, the Yoshida government passed a resolution at a meeting of Democratic Liberal Party members of parliament on the 7th to establish a reactionary organization called the "Non-Japanese Committee" in the new parliament, imitating the "Un-American Activities Committee" in the U.S. Congress.

　　日本众院选举以来
  　两个阵营斗争激烈
  　日共影响正继续增涨
    【新华社陕北十三日电】东京讯：自从一月二十三日日本众院选举以来，日本进步阵营与反动阵营之间的斗争十分激烈。
    在进步阵营方面，日本共产党在发起组织人民民主统一阵线运动以后，现仍致力于实现这一目标。七日，日共总书记德田球一在共产党议员所举行的记者招待会上宣称：“共产党将在任何可能的地方与工农党和社会党以及其他群众团体共同进行反独占资本的斗争”（路透社）。日共争取日本独立与民主化的十三点建议，虽为社会党领导机关所拒绝，但受到广大人民的拥护。以产业劳动组合联合会为代表的有组织工人，以北海道社会党党人为代表的社会党下层党员，以知识分子反法西斯大会为代表的进步知识分子，均拥护组织这种人民民主阵线。日共的影响正继续增涨着。据路透社讯，社会党与工农党十一名党员，包括本州中部石川县工会执行委员八人，九日在该县金泽举行的三党联席会议上参加了日共。德田于七日曾宣布“日共纲领的要点为坚决不渝地反对保守党派”（路透社）。日共组织现已对民主自由党一群议员在选举中的舞弊行为，提出起诉与告发。
    在反动阵营方面，麦克阿瑟卵翼下执政的民主自由党，一方面加紧其结众日本反动势力的活动，另一方面加紧布置对日本民主力量的进攻。民主自由党党魁吉田茂曾与民主党党魁犬养健一再商讨组织联合的反动内阁问题，然而终因争权夺利，至今联合不成。现民主自由党正从事组织孤立的一党反动内阁中。为了镇压民主力量，吉田政府除了下令禁止工会进行政治活动与秘密准备修改劳工法以外，七日在民主自由党的议员会议上，曾通过在新议会中仿效美国会中的“非美委员会”建立“非日委员会”的反动组织。
