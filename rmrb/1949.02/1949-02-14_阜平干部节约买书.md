　　△ The Fuping County Party Committee established a study committee as early as last November, but so far there have been no significant achievements. The main reason is the problem of empiricism; some people believe that "you can work without studying." After study and review, everyone re-recognized the North China Bureau's decision on on-the-job cadre study. Now, cadres who do not go to the countryside are required to study collectively in the morning and study independently in the evening. Cadres who go to the countryside focus on self-study and take make-up classes when they return to the office. The content of study is based on what is designated by the District Party Committee, and three additional courses are added: Chinese, arithmetic, and current affairs. Four study disciplines have also been established: (1) Be on time for class. (2) Observe classroom order. (3) Implement roll call and leave system. (4) Regularly assess and adjust grade levels based on academic performance. Under the call of the Study Committee, many cadres are practicing economy to buy books.

　　阜平干部节约买书
    △阜平县委被关在去年十一月即成立了学委会，但至今尚无显著成绩，主要原因是经验主义在作怪，有些人认为“不学习也可以工作”。经过学习检查，大家重新认识了华北局关于在职干部学习的决定。现在，不下乡的干部规定早晨集体学习，晚上自修。下乡的干部以自学为主，回机关时补课。学习内容以区党委指定的为基础，另添国语、算术、时事三课。并订出了四项学习纪律：（一）按时到课。（二）遵守课堂秩序。（三）实行点名，请假制。（四）按学习成绩随时评定升降级。在学委会的号召下有许多干部都实行节约买书。（罗凤文、王孝民、张法典、孟广城）
