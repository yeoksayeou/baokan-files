  　Yangko Teams Flood the Streets Late at Night

    [Reported by our newspaper] After the news of our army's liberation of Beiping reached Shijiazhuang, the people of the city were extremely excited. Worker and student Yangko teams went out late at night, forgetting their fatigue. When Guangming Factory received the news, it immediately spread to every workshop. The workers who were resting discussed it in twos and threes. Some said, "Once Tianjin was liberated, we knew it would be soon!" Others said, "Okay, now the Nanjing gang should be even more panicked." Some people busied themselves going to the streets to perform the Yangko dance, carrying out the large banner of the Yangko team. Before long, the Yangko teams of the branch factory workers also came from several miles away, beating gongs and drums. The Girls' Middle School was holding a joint ceremony for the end of the semester and Party membership applications. Section Chief Nie of the Education Bureau received a victory report and announced it to everyone. The students immediately jumped up happily and shouted. The Municipal No. 1 Middle School was holding a similar meeting, and the students' hats were flying around the venue.
    At 9:30 PM, the Municipal Cultural Center and the Municipal Federation of Trade Unions officially notified the factories and schools. At about 10:00 PM, the students of Municipal No. 2 Middle School, dancing, singing, and shouting slogans, first appeared on Zhongshan Road. The workers of the Guangming Factory also came, disregarding the fatigue of a day's work. The appearance of this Yangko team attracted people's attention, and the sides were crowded with people. Every time they stopped, people surrounded them in layers. They used oil hemp ropes that had been used to wipe machines, tying them to long poles to use as torches. Fu Xin, a worker from the loading and unloading team, pushed a cart of oil hemp ropes and danced and jumped at the head of the Yangko team. When they reached the entrance of Jinghua Commercial Bank, Jinghua Commercial Bank turned on the electric lights of the already extinguished colored archway and played music records to welcome them. Many people who had fallen asleep heard the loud singing and drumming, put on their clothes again, turned on the lights and listened. Later, hearing the news of the liberation of Beiping, they opened their shops again to come out to inquire and watch the excitement. A firecracker vendor set off two "skyrockets" and then set off "two-stage firecrackers." When the team reached the western end of Zhongshan Road, they joined the Yangko teams from the No. 2 Middle School, the Federation of Trade Unions, the Electric Light Company, and the Telephone Bureau, forming a large team of six people in a row to march to Nanma Road. The time was already past 12:00 midnight, but the workers of the Guangming Factory shouted the challenge slogan "Go to Qiaodong" to the No. 2 Middle School, and the No. 2 Middle School immediately responded to their challenge with loud slogans. This team circled around near the Municipal Club. The hemp oil ropes brought by the Guangming Factory were used up, and they turned back to the eastern end of Zhongshan Road, shouted slogans for a while, and then dispersed. When the workers of the Guangming Factory returned to the factory, it was already 2:00 AM. (Mu Yang)

　　喜闻北平获得解放
  　石市全市一片欢腾
  　各秧歌队深夜涌上街头
    关了的店门又开了！
    熄了的电灯又亮了！
    睡了的人们起来了！
    唱片又重新歌唱了！
    　　　　　　
    【本报讯】我军解放北平的消息传来石市后，全市人民极度振奋。工人、学生的秧歌队深夜出动，忘记了疲劳。光明厂得到这个消息，立刻就传遍了每个工作间。正在休息着的工人们，三三两两的议论起来，有的说：“天津一解放，咱就知道快啦！”有的说：“行啦，南京那帮子该更发慌啦。”有的人就张罗着到街上去扭秧歌，把秧歌队的大横旗扛了出来。不一会，分厂职工们的秧歌队也敲着锣鼓从几里地以外赶来了。女中正在开着休业、入党的联合仪式大会，教育局的聂科长接到捷报条子，当众宣布，同学们立刻快乐的蹦起来，喊起来。市立一中正在开着同样的大会，同学们的帽子都在会场上飞舞起来。
    晚九点半钟，才由民教馆、市总工会正式的通知各工厂和学校。十时许，市立二中的同学们扭着、唱着、喊着口号，首先出现在中山路上。光明厂的职工们也不顾一天工作的疲劳赶来了。这支秧歌队一出现就引起了人们的注意，两旁挤满了人群。每到停下来的时候，人们就层层的围上。他们用擦过机器的油麻绳挑在长杆子上当火把。装卸大队工人傅新推着一车子油麻绳，也在秧歌队的前头扭跳起来。走到经华商行的门口，经华商行又把已经熄了的彩牌楼上的电灯开亮，放出音乐唱片来迎接他们。许多睡了的人听见歌鼓喧天，又穿衣起来，打开电灯听着。后来听到是北平解放的消息，便又打开店门走出来打听，看热闹。一个卖鞭炮的小贩放了两个“钻天起花”，又放起“二起炮”来。队伍走到中山路的西头，就给二中、总工会、电灯公司、电话局的秧歌队汇合在一起，组成六个人一排的大队往南马路走去。时间已经是夜十二点多了，可是光明厂的职工们却向二中喊出了“到桥东去”的挑战口号，二中也立刻以口号响亮的回答了他们的挑战。这支队伍一直绕到市俱乐部附近，光明厂带出来的麻油绳也用完了，他们才又折回中山路东头，呼了一阵口号各自散队。光明厂的职工们回到厂里的时候，已是夜间的两点钟了。（穆扬）
