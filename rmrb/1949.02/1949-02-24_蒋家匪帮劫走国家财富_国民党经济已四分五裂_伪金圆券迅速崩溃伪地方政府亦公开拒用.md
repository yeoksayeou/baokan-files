Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 22nd: The bureaucratic capitalist bandit gang, led by the Chiang, Soong, Kung, and Chen families, is engaging in the criminal activity of robbing national wealth and the people's hard-earned money. Before declaring his "retirement," bandit chieftain Chiang Kai-shek personally ordered the puppet Resource Commission on the 5th of last month to move four "state-owned" factories in Nanjing—those manufacturing radio equipment, radio assembly, porcelain insulators, and light bulbs—along with their equipment and all technical personnel to Taiwan. The famous Hanyang Arsenal was also looted and transported to Taiwan by Chiang's bandits. Since the middle of last month, materials from various departments of the Kuomintang government, including military equipment and supplies, have been looted and transported to Taiwan, Guangzhou, and various parts of South China. After bandit chieftain Chiang Kai-shek's "retirement," these materials were transported south even more rapidly. Cash reserves and foreign exchange were looted in large quantities. Most of the gold, silver, foreign currency, and securities stored in the puppet Central Bank have been looted and transported to Taiwan and South China, ready to be smuggled overseas at any time. As a result of the bandit gang's looting and transportation of huge quantities of materials and equipment to Taiwan, as of last month, the port of Keelung on the island had a backlog of 120,000 tons of goods piled up in docks, warehouses, and awaiting unloading. Furthermore, as a result of the bandit gang's looting of huge amounts of military and government funds to be exchanged in Taiwan, on the 4th of this month, the Bank of Taiwan announced that its branches in the mainland felt "flooded with Gold Yuan currency." Xue Yue, the puppet chairman of Guangdong Province, admitted on the 2nd of this month: "More and more government personnel are carrying Gold Yuan to Guangzhou, causing serious inflation in Guangdong." The various organs of the Kuomintang puppet government, various banks, and the ringleaders of the Kuomintang bandit gang are now in Guangzhou, using pseudo-Gold Yuan to抢 buy foreign currency and gold, preparing to flee abroad. The private or joint public-private bureaucratic capital accumulated by the bandit gang's bureaucratic capitalists through their usual exploitation of the people's wealth is also escaping in various ways. Their gold and U.S. dollars have mostly been transported to the United States or Taiwan. Bureaucratic capital banks and companies are establishing new organizations in the Philippines, declaring their separation from the mainland. The factory equipment that has been moved to Taiwan or Guangdong will reappear under the guise of so-called "private enterprises." In enterprises that have not been moved, the bureaucratic capital shares that were originally jointly invested with ordinary private capital are being sold, transferred, or changed in name as much as possible to escape confiscation. Some bureaucratic capital is even transforming itself into the property of foreign nationals.

Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 22nd: The Kuomintang bandit gang is in a state of economic and political disintegration. Due to the疯狂 devaluation and complete loss of credibility of the pseudo-Gold Yuan, many Kuomintang local governments have publicly refused to continue using the pseudo-Gold Yuan. These pseudo-local governments are successively preparing to issue local currencies to replace the pseudo-Gold Yuan. The Sichuan Provincial Pseudo-Council has proposed to Zhang Qun, director of the Kuomintang Chongqing Pacification Headquarters, the suggestion of issuing Sichuan provincial banknotes and not using the Gold Yuan. Guangdong, Guangxi, Fujian, Hunan, and other provinces are all planning to issue local currency, and the Guangzhou Chamber of Commerce has even suggested issuing Guangzhou municipal treasury bills. Bao Erhan, the pseudo-chairman of Xinjiang Province, stated in Dihua on the 14th that Xinjiang Province had received instructions from Zhang Zhizhong, the Kuomintang Northwest Military and Political Commander, to plan the issuance of silver standard currency. Taiwan, Guangdong, Sichuan, Yunnan, and other places have all explicitly prohibited the entry of Gold Yuan and restricted remittances. Xiamen has implemented a primitive method of using one catty of rice as a unit of transaction. It is reported that all transactions in the city, from electricity, telephone, tap water fees, newspaper subscriptions to barber fees and ferry fees, are calculated in rice. A haircut costs three to five catties of rice, and installing a telephone costs eighty catties of rice.

Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 22nd: It is widely rumored that the number of pseudo-Gold Yuan issued has reached about 100 billion. This figure is approximately 500 times the total amount of 6 million billion old legal tender converted to pseudo-Gold Yuan 200 million. The Nanjing puppet government dares not announce the true number of pseudo-Gold Yuan issued, falsely claiming that only about 20 billion has been issued (according to a Central News Agency dispatch from Guangzhou on the 19th), but even this amount is about 100 times the amount of the old legal tender. The Pseudo-Supervisory Yuan admitted in a resolution on the 15th: "The issuance of Gold Yuan is unrestricted, and it has followed in the footsteps of the legal tender. In fact, the collapse of the pseudo-Gold Yuan is faster and more harmful than that of the legal tender." Due to the collapse of the pseudo-Gold Yuan, prices in various parts of the Kuomintang-controlled areas are continuing to soar. The price of rice in Shanghai on the 12th had risen to 12,000 pseudo-Gold Yuan per stone, which is 470 times higher than the price on August 19 last year. In addition, prices in Guangzhou, Kunming, Chongqing, and Guilin have also been soaring recently. In Guilin, prices have been increasing every hour since the 17th. Amidst the general price increases, the price increases of the puppet government's public utilities are still leading the way. The prices of general public utilities are now 700 times those of August 19 last year, and have increased four times in the past month alone, with each increase being three or four times.

　　蒋家匪帮劫走国家财富
    国民党经济已四分五裂
    伪金圆券迅速崩溃伪地方政府亦公开拒用
    【新华社陕北二十二日电】以蒋宋孔陈四大家族为首的官僚资本家匪帮，正从事劫走国家财富及人民血汗的罪恶活动。匪首蒋介石在宣告“引退”前，于上月五日亲自下令伪资源委员会将南京的“国营”的制造无线电器材、无线电装配、瓷制绝缘体及电灯泡等四个工厂携带装备及全部技术员工迁至台湾。著名的汉阳兵工厂亦被蒋匪劫运至台湾。自上月中旬起国民党政府各部门的物资，包括军事装备及物资即开始被劫运至台湾广州及华南各地，匪首蒋介石“引退”后，这些物资更被加速南运。库存现金外汇被大量劫走。伪中央银行所存的金、银、外币及有价证券大部分已被劫运至台湾及华南准备随时卷逃海外。由于国民党匪帮将巨量物资及装备劫运到台湾的结果，上月间该岛基隆港口积存码头仓库及待卸之物资竟达十二万吨之多。而由于匪帮劫走巨额军公款项兑往台湾的结果，本月四日台湾省银行宣布该行在内地的各分行已感到“金圆券头寸充斥”。广东省伪主席薛岳本月二日承认：“愈来愈多的政府人员携带金圆券到达广州。正在广东引起严重的通货膨胀。国民党伪政府的各机关中各银行和国民党匪帮的首要们，现在正在广州以伪金圆券抢买外币、黄金，准备卷逃国外。匪帮官僚资本家平日搜刮人民的脂膏血汗积累起来的私人的或官私合营的官僚资本，亦以各种方法纷纷逃避。他们的黄金和美金多已运到美国或台湾。官僚资本的银行和公司正在菲律宾成立新的组织，宣告与国内脱离关系。已搬到台湾或广东的工厂装备，将以所谓“民营企业”的面目分散出现。未迁企业中原与普通私人资本合股的官僚股本，正在尽量出卖、出让或改换户头，以求逃脱没收，有一部分官僚资本甚至摇身一变而为外国侨民的财产。
    【新华社陕北廿二日电】国民党匪帮在经济上和政治上同样陷于四分五裂的境地。由于伪金圆券的疯狂贬值和信用全失，国民党许多地方政府公开拒绝继续使用伪金圆券。这些伪地方政府正相继准备发行地方货币以代替伪金圆券。四川省伪参议会已向国民党重庆绥靖公署主任张群提出发行四川省钞票、不用金圆券的建议。广东、广西、福建、湖南等省都在计划发地方券，广州市商会并建议发行广州市库券。新疆省伪主席鲍尔汉于十四日在迪化声称：新省已得国民党西北军政长官张治中指示，计划发行银本位币。台湾、广东、四川、云南等地都已明令限制金圆券入境和限制汇兑。厦门实行了以一斤大米为交易单位的原始办法。据息：该市一切交易，从电灯、电话费、自来水费、订报费一直到理发费、摆渡费，都以大米计算。理发费要付三斤到五斤大米，装电话费要付八十斤大米。
    【新华社陕北二十二日电】各方盛传，伪金圆券发行数字已达千亿左右。这个数字较之旧法币发行总额六百万亿，合伪金圆券二亿膨胀了五百倍左右：南京伪政府不敢将伪金圆券的真实发行数字公布，诡称只发行了二百亿左右（据中央社广州十九日电），但即是这个数目，较之旧法币也已膨胀了一百倍左右。伪监察院十五日决议中承认：“金圆券发行漫无限制，已蹈法币覆辙。实际伪金圆券的崩溃比法币更快，为祸更烈。”由于伪金圆券的崩溃，国民党统治区各地物价正继续猛涨不已。上海米价十二日已涨达每石售伪金圆券一万二千元，较之去年八月十九日的价格已涨高四百七十倍。此外，广州、昆明、重庆、桂林的物价最近也都在狂涨、桂林物价十七日起每一小时上跃一次。在一般物价的上涨中，伪政府公用事业的加价仍然是带头者。目前一般公共事业的价格已为去年八月十九日的七百倍，最近一月中即加价四次，每次加价三、四倍不等。
