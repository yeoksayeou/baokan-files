　　Supreme Soviet Meeting—The highest political power and legislative body of the Soviet Union, i.e., the Supreme Soviet, consists of two chambers: the Soviet of the Union (Union Chamber), whose representatives are elected by Soviet citizens in accordance with the election law, with one representative elected for every 300,000 people; and the Soviet of Nationalities (National Chamber), whose representatives are elected by the various Union Republics, Autonomous Republics, Autonomous Provinces, and National Prefectures. Regardless of population size, each Union Republic elects 25 representatives, each Autonomous Republic elects 11 representatives, each Autonomous Province elects 5 representatives, and each National Prefecture elects 1 representative. The two chambers have a total of 1,443 representatives. The term of office for representatives of the Supreme Soviet is four years. According to the Soviet Constitution, the two chambers hold regular sessions twice a year (i.e., the Supreme Soviet Meeting), convened by the Presidium of the Supreme Soviet. In the event of extraordinary meetings, the Presidium of the Supreme Soviet convenes them as deemed appropriate or at the request of a Union Republic. The Supreme Soviet holds all major state powers concerning military affairs, politics, legislation, and the economy. Its specific major powers, as stipulated by the Constitution, primarily include approving foreign treaties, handling declarations of war and peace, accepting new republics into the Soviet Union, organizing national defense, granting amnesties, etc. When the Supreme Soviet Meeting is not in session, its powers are exercised by the Presidium. The current Chairman of the Presidium of the Supreme Soviet is Shvernik. The Chairman of the Union Chamber is Zhdanov (deceased, currently represented by the Vice-Chairman), and the Vice-Chairmen are Lyubimov and Undasynov. The Chairman of the National Chamber is Kuznetsov, and the Vice-Chairmen are Adzhiev and Rishki.
　　Antarctica—The Earth rotates around the sun from west to east and is tilted at an angle of approximately 23 degrees relative to its axis and the equatorial plane. China is located in the northern hemisphere of the Earth. Due to the Earth's tilted rotation, there are four seasons and differences in day and night length. The area within 66 degrees 33 minutes south latitude around the south pole is called the Antarctic Circle. The area within the Antarctic Circle is more than 21.12 million square kilometers, accounting for over 4% of the global surface area. Because Antarctica is too far from the direct sunlight zone, the climate is extremely cold, with the lowest temperature reaching minus 40 degrees Celsius and the highest temperature only reaching 6.5 degrees Celsius. The difference between day and night is also different from China. In summer, the sun is not visible in Antarctica, while in winter, the sun is visible day and night. Therefore, it is permanently covered in ice and snow. Humans had always believed that Antarctica was a large sea until Russian explorers first overturned this notion in 1820. Although no one lives in Antarctica permanently, explorers and whaling fleets (including those from the Soviet Union) frequently visit it. It has been explored and confirmed that Antarctica has a high plateau with an average elevation of 600 meters above sea level, covering an area of approximately 13.61 million square kilometers, which is more than 3 million square kilometers larger than Europe. The plateau is surrounded by icy seas. These seas contain animals such as whales, sea lions, and walruses, as well as penguins, a unique bird to Antarctica, which are stout with small wings and walk in large groups along the coast. According to scientists' explorations, the strata of Antarctica contain very rich metal minerals. Therefore, imperialist countries such as Britain and the United States are attempting to seize this territory exclusively.

    最高苏维埃会议——苏联国家的最高政权和立法机关，即最高会议，由两院组成，一为联盟苏维埃（联盟院），其代表由苏联公民依照选举法规定接选举区分别选举之，每三十万人口选举代表一人。一为民族苏维埃（民族院），其代表由各加盟共和国，自治共和国，自治省民族州等选举之。不问其人口多寡，每一加盟共和国均选举代表二十五人，每一自治共和国选举代表十一人，每一自治省选举代表五人，每一民族州选举代表一人。两院共有代表一千四百四十三人。最高苏维埃的代表任期为四年。按苏联宪法规定，两院每年举行常会两次（即最高苏维埃会议），由最高苏维埃主席团负责召集之。若有非常会议时，最高苏维埃主席团按期酌定或某一加盟共和国要求召集之，最高苏维埃掌握国家一切军、政、立法、经济大权，它的具体大权按宪法的规定主要的是批准对外的条约，处理宣战、媾和，接受新共和国家加入苏联，组织国防保卫国家，颁布大赦等。在最高苏维埃会议闭幕后，即由主席团行使权力。现在的苏联最高苏维埃主席团主席为斯尔维尼克。联盟院主席为日丹诺夫（已故由副主席代理之），副主席是勒比科和温达史诺夫。民族院的主席为库茨捏佐夫，副主席为阿及也诺夫和里什斯基。
    南极——地球是绕着太阳自西往东自转，并且以地轴与赤道面成二十三度左右的倾斜度转着，中国在地球的北半部，因为地球倾斜着自转的关系，所以有四季之分，有昼夜长短的区别。在南端轴心的周围，南纬六十六度三十三分以内的地区，就称为南极圈，南极圈内的面积共有二千一百廿多方公里，约占全球面积的百分之四强。南极因为距离太阳的直射地带过远，气候极其严寒，最低温度在摄氏零下四十度，最高温度只达摄氏六度半。昼夜的区别也和中国不一样，在夏天时，南极不见太阳，在冬天时，南极日夜都有太阳。所以终年为冰雪封固，人类一直认为南极是一个大海，直到一八二○年首先由俄罗斯的探险家推翻了这种说法。现在南极虽还没人常年居住，但探险家捕鲸队（包括苏联）却时常去，已经探察确定南极有一块平均拔海六百公尺的高台地，面积约一千三百六十一万方公里，比欧洲要大三百多万方公里。高地的周围就是冰海。这海里有鲸，海狮，海象等动物，并有一种南极地方特有的企鹅鸟，体肥翅小，成大群地步行于海滨。据科学家探知：南极的地层中，蕴藏着很丰富的金属矿物，所以英美等帝国主义国家，妄图单独霸占这块地方。
