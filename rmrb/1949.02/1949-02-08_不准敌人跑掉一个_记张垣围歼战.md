　　Not Letting a Single Enemy Escape
    —A Record of the Zhangjiakou Annihilation Battle
    Fang Yatian, Xu Kong
    On the morning of December 23, 1948, the moon had just set and the morning star hadn't yet appeared, our mobile sentry outside Dajingmen set off three hand grenades. The Nationalist bandit army's 11th Army Group, besieged in Zhangjiakou, comprised five infantry divisions, two cavalry brigades, and two security regiments, totaling over 50,000 men. They妄想试图想要穿过市北西甸子, 朝天洼大沟，向北突围了. We only had five battalions guarding the ten-mile-long front line in this area, and they were deployed in depth. However, every commander and fighter had an unwavering determination:
    "Resolutely eliminate the enemy in Zhangjiakou!"
    "Don't let a single enemy escape!"
    "Never retreat a single step without orders!"
    Thus, this heroic defense battle unfolded.

　　The First Gate to Block the Enemy's Escape Route
    Xidianzi is a small village six or seven li north of Dajingmen on the left bank of the Dagu gully, and is the first gate on the enemy's escape route. The 1st Company of the × unit was guarding the position in front of the village. When the soldiers saw a dark mass of figures appearing on the opposite side of the small river, they all gripped their bayonets and hand grenades: "Good! We've been guarding you in the freezing weather for twelve or thirteen days, this time we'll let you see the sky!" (meaning to die facing upwards)
    "Rifles, fire in volleys! Machine guns and hand grenades, fire!" "Gaga boom boom..." A hail of bullets and explosions sent countless dark figures tumbling into the river, and the rest retreated back to the opposite bank, out of sight.
    When the sky was just beginning to show a reddish glow, the enemy, stuck to the south of the village, began to bombard the position fiercely with artillery, filling the area with smoke and gunpowder. The soldiers cursed from inside their fortifications: "See how many shells you have, if you hurt even a hair on my head, you'll pay with your life!" As the artillery fire shifted into the depth, the grenadiers immediately jumped out of their fortifications. At this time, two more enemy battalions were boldly and recklessly charging forward. A burst of machine gun fire and hand grenades sent these audacious "heroes" retreating in a panicked scramble, leaving behind twenty or thirty corpses without even reaching the front.
    However, the enemy was determined to capture this "first gate to escape." After the second charge, an unusual silence fell on the position. All the enemies were lying prone in the depression sixty or seventy meters away, while fierce gunfire had already erupted behind the mountain on the right. The company commander was getting anxious when suddenly a group of enemies appeared on the mountain. In a split second, all the soldiers saw them. The enemies on the mountain immediately unleashed firepower on the position in front of the village from a commanding position: light and heavy machine guns, 60 mortars, rifle grenades, and heavy mortars. You couldn't see me, I couldn't see you, and under the cover of this dominating firepower, the enemies in front began to charge. Communist Party member Yuan Donghai jumped up and shouted: "We Communist Party members must not lose the position entrusted to us by the Party!" Seventh squad leader crawled to the front line, stopping the wound in his left chest. Everyone forgot about casualties, even though bullets and shrapnel were flying everywhere. Everyone straightened up and desperately threw grenades at the enemy. Obviously, the enemies were also getting desperate this time. Those holding small flags kept beating with the flagpoles, and those charging in front crawled up the slope like ants rolling eggs. Those in front fell, and those behind stepped on the corpses. After fighting for more than thirty minutes, the enemy collapsed, and the small ditch in front of the position was covered with a dark layer of bodies. However, a new difficulty arose for us. The entire company had run out of all ammunition, except for thirty odd bullets, five or six hand grenades, and one 60mm mortar shell. At that moment, the enemies on the mountain pressed down again. The deputy company commander looked at everyone and said: "Comrades! If we don't have bullets, use stones. If we don't have stones, use our teeth. As long as we have a breath left, we cannot let the enemies take our position!"
    The enemies in front had already reached six or seven meters away. The two sides were only separated by a low wall, and you could hear the enemies' panting. A narrow-faced, yellow-skinned commander was frantically waving a small flag and shouting as if he had been saved: "There's no one left inside, charge!" The deputy company commander lined up his gun, and this guy fell down with his arms spread and his buttocks facing the sky. The soldiers immediately scattered and retreated. We used this method and held on for another two hours. Two enemy regiments crawled back and forth in front of this position, which was less than one hundred meters in diameter. They were indeed terrified by these loyal heroes.

　　Two Hand Grenades Capture the Hilltop
    The bandit army's 32nd Division was dizzy and disoriented after being beaten at Xidianzi, so they had to pull out another infantry division and a cavalry brigade, and break into the Da Thirty Kiln Valley, attempting to open up another escape route from here. Blocking this division and brigade were the 8th and 9th companies of the × unit.
    When the two sides were fighting fiercely, a platoon guarding the high point in the middle of the 8th and 9th companies suffered casualties, and more than seventy enemies rushed to this high point. The positions of the 8th and 9th companies below were immediately under a deadly threat. Instructor Yan handed over the extremely important task of retaking the high point to the 2nd Platoon.
    Hou Guozhong, the consistently brave 2nd Platoon leader, brought his men up. The soldiers asked Instructor Yan: "Instructor, is there any ammunition left?" "There are two hand grenades left!" Hou Guozhong had already seen the embarrassed expression on Instructor Yan's face and said:
    "Comrades! Who is a hero? Who is a weakling? It all depends on this move. Even with one hand grenade, we must resolutely retake this hilltop!" Instructor Yan took out the only two hand grenades: "Good! I'll give them all to you!"
    They went up too fiercely and too quickly. Plus, with the cover of the terrain, the enemies didn't notice them until they were almost at the top of the mountain. Hou Guozhong first threw out his two hand grenades. Then the enemies' hand grenades were thrown down. They picked them up and threw them back. Those who couldn't find hand grenades threw stones up. The enemies on the mountain couldn't withstand this fierce attack and fled in a panic. The high point was once again under our control. And this group of enemies who attempted to "open up another path" were blocked in this dark mountain, going around in circles.

　　The Heroic Regiment Commander Zou
    At one o'clock in the afternoon, on the cliff on the east side of Pingdingshan Mountain, Regiment Commander Zou was on the phone with the leaders of the column, reporting the situation. With a "whoosh" sound, a 60mm mortar shell landed in front of him, followed by another one. It was almost like a myth, the second shell was only two steps away from him, but it didn't injure him, only splashed him with dirt. Regiment Commander Zou rubbed his eyes and continued his phone call. He was talking about: "Even if there is only one person left, we must defend the position of one person..." when the telephone operator slammed him hard: "Enemy!" He looked up and six or seven enemies were already ten steps away from him. This was a truly critical moment, but Regiment Commander Zou didn't put down the headset. He waved his left hand vigorously: "Communicator, fight them!" Zhang Fengshan shot down one enemy with one shot. The four cover squad comrades who were monitoring the northeast also suddenly turned around, and with a bayonet thrust, the enemies didn't even have time to throw their hand grenades, and they tumbled down the cliff with a cry.
    However, the danger did not end there. After the enemies climbed over Xidianzi, this place became a must-contend-for area. Regiment Commander Zou was talking on the phone while keeping an eye on the situation. The enemies organized two more charges forty or fifty meters below the cliff: one down the southern ridge and the other using the same old path. Regiment Commander Zou had already thrown all his reserves into the front. At this time, he only had one guard, two communicators, and the comrades from the four cover squads with him. However, the direct connection between the brigade and the column had been cut off, and this place had become a bridge for communication between the two sides. If they immediately moved their position, neither side would know, and the entire command system would be disrupted. Moreover, there was an emergency situation at hand. The column leader said on the phone:
    "Friendly forces from all directions are rushing here, and will arrive before dusk. Your brigade must immediately concentrate on the Chaotianwa and Wulahada line, resolutely block the enemy, and wait for the arrival of friendly forces."
    This was a major event related to the overall victory and had to be told to the brigade command post immediately—without stopping for even a minute.
    "Even if I die here, I must not let the entire battle suffer losses!" He put down the headset and immediately wrote a letter to the brigade on the spot.
    He had just written three or two sentences when the enemies' two charges had already approached twenty or thirty meters:
    "Communicator, guard the south. Cover squad, east. Hand grenades, fire!"
    The enemies were truly cowardly. Two charges, three or four companies of troops, were beaten down by our seven people with a barrage of hand grenades.
    Regiment Commander Zou completed his letter and wrote at the end: "The position has been moved back two hundred meters. The back mountain of Xixunzi is still firmly in our hands. The time was 2:00 PM."

　　The Last Five Minutes
    The enemies' original dream was very beautiful. After Yuan Qingrong was captured, he talked about their breakout plan: "We originally planned to use two cavalry brigades, plus all the vehicles, to exit the west pass, attracting your main force. At the same time, we would use the entire strength of five infantry divisions to break out north from Dajingmen. As long as the west side can hold you for three or four hours, we can break through thirty or forty li."
    But now it wasn't three or four hours, it had been seven or eight hours. And the area they had broken through—from Xidianzi to Chaotianwa section—was less than "thirty or forty" li. They knew that if they wanted to escape, they had to break through this valley before dark. But we also knew that in order to completely and entirely annihilate the enemies, we had to block them until dusk (when the friendly forces could arrive). This final five-minute battle for control turned red-hot below the Buddha Temple Mountain in Chaotianwa.
    It was said that the enemies' charge here was only one regiment. No, who knew if it was one division or two divisions? The river bed from Dajingmen, more than ten li long, was filled with people and horses. Along the riverbank, along the woods and earthen embankments, dozens of entire companies and battalions charged up. Hand grenades flew into the position like flocks of crows, and the position was filled with smoke and fire, like a steaming cage with the lid off. Our soldiers ran out and jumped back in here. Culture instructor Song Huiqi shouted: "Holding on for the last five minutes is our victory!" Communist Party member Liu Yongshan picked up a machine gun, and a string of sparks mowed down five enemies. The enemies' seven charges were all beaten back. They ran around in the mountain gullies in a state of nervous breakdown. Cavalry tripped over infantry, wagons overturned into the crowd, and the soldiers, while fighting hand-to-hand on the mountain, shouted: "It's really a pot of porridge!"
    The sky gradually darkened—around eight o'clock, gunfire erupted from all directions, and the friendly forces had arrived. With the formation of the encirclement deployment, all the enemies who妄想企图突围 were annihilated.

　　不准敌人跑掉一个
    ——记张垣围歼战
    房亚田、徐孔
    一九四八年十二月二十三号早上，月亮刚落，启明星还没出来，我们大镜门外的流动哨摔响了三颗手榴弹；困守在张垣的国民党匪军十一兵团所辖五个步兵师、两个骑兵旅、两个保安团等共五万多人，妄想穿过市北西甸子，朝天洼大沟向北突围了。我们把守这一带长达十里阵地的只有五个营，而且是纵深配备。但是我们每个指战员同志都具有坚定不移的决心：
    “坚决消灭张家口的敌人！”
    “不准敌人跑掉一个！”
    “没有命令绝不后退一步！”
    如是这个英雄的阻击战展开了。
　　扼住敌人逃路的第一关
    西甸子是大镜门北六七里大沟左岸上的一个小村庄，是敌人逃路的第一关。我们把守村前阵地的是×部一连。当战士们看到对面小河上现出一片黑黝黝的人影时，全握紧了剌刀、手榴弹：“好！冰天雪地的守你们十二三天了，这回叫你们看看天！”（仰毙之意）
    “步枪，排放！机枪手榴弹，打！”“嘎嘎轰轰……”一片火舌无数的黑影栽在河上，其余的缩回对岸看不清了。
    东半天似红不红的时候，被卡在村南的敌人，开始向阵地施行猛烈的炮击，阵地上烟硝滚滚。战士们在工事里骂：“看你有多少炮弹，伤着老子根毛也得拿脑袋赔！”炮火向纵深一转，投弹手立刻跳出工事，这时正面上两个多营的敌人正大胆无忌的呀呀的冲上来。一阵机枪手榴弹，这群大胆无忌的“英雄”们连跟前也没到，丢下二三十具死尸连爬带滚的退了回去。
    可是，这个“逃路的第一关”，敌人是一定要拼命夺取的。第二次冲锋以后，阵地前出现一阵异样的寂静，所有敌人全部伏在六七十米的洼地里不动，而右侧山后已经响起激烈的枪声。一连长正在着急，猛的一股敌人在山上出现了，就在一霎眼的工夫，所有的战士们也都看见了。山上的敌人立刻居高临下向村前阵地展开火力了：轻重机枪、六○炮、枪榴弹、迫击炮。阵地上你看不见我，我看不见你，而正面的敌人，就在这制高火力的掩护下开始冲锋了。共产党员袁东海跳起来喊：“我们共产党员决不能丢掉党交给我们的阵地！”七班长塞住左胸的伤口又爬上前沿。大家谁也忘记什么叫伤亡了，尽管它满天是子弹爆片乱飞，可是大家全直起身来向敌人拼命的投弹。显然的，敌人这次也急了，拿小旗的不住的用旗杆乱打，前边冲锋的就象蚂蚁滚蛋似的顺着斜坡往上爬，前边的倒了，后边的就从死尸上踩过去。两下里争夺了三十多分种，敌人垮了，阵地前小河沟里躺了黑鸦鸦一层。可是，我们新的困难也来了，全连丢下三十多发子弹、手榴弹五六个、六○炮弹一颗也没剩。就在这时候，山上的敌人又压下来了。副连长眼看着大家：“同志们！没有子弹用石头，没有石头用牙咬，只要一口气在就不能叫敌人夺去我们的阵地！”
    前面的敌人已经进到六七米的地方了，两下里只隔一道矮墙，敌人呼嗤呼嗤喘气的声音都听得见。一个窄黄脸的指挥官，不住的摇幌小旗得救似的嚷：“里边没什么人了，冲啊！”“你冲！”副连长一顺枪，这家伙两臂一张，屁股朝天栽下来了，当兵的立刻溃散回去。我们就用这个方法，又坚持了两个钟头，敌人两个来团的兵力，就在这方圆不到一百米达的阵地跟前爬来滚去，他们也的确被这些忠诚的英雄们打怕了。
　　两颗手榴弹夺下山头
    匪军三十二师在西甸子被打得头昏眼花，只好抽出另一个步兵师一个骑兵旅，闯进代三十窖子山沟，企图从这里另辟逃路。阻击这一个师一个旅的是×部八九两个连。
    当两下里打得正激烈的时候，把守八九连中间高点的一排，有的挂花，有的牺牲，七十多个敌人抢上这个高点。下面八九连的阵地立刻受到致命的威胁。阎教导员就把这个夺回高点的极端重大的任务交给了二排。
    一贯勇敢的二排长侯国忠把人员带上来了。战士们问阎教导员：“教导员，还有弹药吗？”“还有两颗手榴弹！”。侯国忠已经看出教导员为难的神情了，就说：
    “同志们！谁是英雄汉？谁是稀泥蛋？全看这一着，就是一颗手榴弹，我们也要坚决的夺回这个山头！”阎教导员拿出那仅有的两颗手榴弹：“好！把这个统交给你们！”
    他们上得太猛太快了，再加上地形的掩蔽，快到山顶时，敌人才发觉，侯国忠先打上自己的两颗手榴弹、跟着敌人的手榴弹就扔下来了。他们拾起来就往回打，拣不着手榴弹的就往上飞石头。山上的敌人吃不住这股猛劲儿，慌慌张张的溜下去。制高点又为我控制。而这股企图“另辟道路”的敌人，就被阻在这黑魃魃的大山里兜圈子。
　　英勇的邹团长
    过午一点，平顶山东侧悬崖上，邹团长正在给纵队首长挂电话，报告情况。“呼噔”的一声跟前落了个六○炮弹，接着又是一个。说来真有点象神话，第二颗离他不过两步远，可是却没有炸伤他，只是溅了混身土。邹团长揉了揉眼睛，继续打电话。正谈到：“剩一个人，我们也要守一个人的阵地……”时，电话员狠狠的砸子他一下：“敌人！”他一抬头，六七个已经离他十来步了。这真是千钧一发呀，可是邹团长并没有放下耳机，左手用力一挥：“通讯员给我打！”张风山一枪放倒一个。正在监视东北方的四个掩护班同志也猛的转过身来刺刀一逼，敌人连手榴弹也没来得及扔，叽哩咕噜翻下山崖去了。
    但是，危险并没有就此终结，敌人爬过西甸子后，这里就成了必争之地。邹团长一边打电话，一边用眼睛看，敌人在崖下四五十米处又组织起两路冲锋：一路顺南边山梁下来，一路还是原来的老道。邹团长已经把所有的预备兵力都投入前边去了，这时在他跟前的只有一个警卫员两个通讯员，四个掩护班的同志。可是旅里和纵队的直接联系已被切断，这里成了两下联络的桥梁，如果马上转移阵地，两下里都不知道，整个指挥系统就要打乱，而且眼下又有一个紧急情况；纵队首长在电话里说：
    “各路友军正从四面八方向这里急进，黄昏以前到达，你旅马上集中朝天洼、乌拉哈达一线，坚决阻击敌人，以待友军。”
    这是关系全局胜利的大事情，必须立刻——一分钟也不停的告诉旅指挥所。
    “即便我牺牲在这里，也绝不能叫整个战斗遭受损失！”他放下耳机，就地给旅里写信。
    刚写了三两句，敌人的两路冲锋已经逼近二三十米了：
    “通讯员警卫员南边，掩护班东边，手榴弹，打！”
    敌人也真松包，两路，三四个连的兵力，被我们这七个人一排子手榴弹就给打下来了。
    邹团长完成了他这封信，在后面写道：“阵地向后转移二百米，西旬子后山依然坚持在我们手里。当时是午后两点。”
　　最后五分钟
    敌人原来的梦想是很美妙的，袁庆荣被俘以后，说起他们的突围计划：“我们原来计划用两个骑兵旅，加上所有的汽车出西口，吸引你们的主力。同时，用五个步兵师力量的全部出大镜门向北突。只要西边能吸住你们三四个钟头，我们就可以突出三四十里。”
    可是现在不是三四个钟头，已经是七八个钟头了，而他们突过的——从西甸子到朝天洼一段，还不到“三四”里。他们知道：如果想逃命，就必需在天黑以前突出这个山谷。可是我们也知道：要想彻底、全部歼灭敌人就必需阻击到黄昏（那时友军才能赶到）。这个最后五分钟的争夺战，就在朝天洼佛爷山下打红了。
    据说敌人向这里冲锋只是一个团，不，谁知是一个师还是两个师呢？从大镜门十几里长的河筒子，人马灌得满满的。他们沿着河岸，沿着树林、土坎，好几十路整连整营的冲上来了。手榴弹就象老鸦群一样飞入阵地，阵地上烟火腾腾，象开了锅的蒸笼一样，我们的战士们就在这里跑出来钻进去。文化教员宋惠岐喊：“坚持最后五分钟就是我们的胜利呀！”党员刘永善端起机枪，一溜火星就撩倒五个。敌人七次冲锋全被打下去了。他们神经错乱的在山沟里窜来窜去；骑兵趟倒步兵，大车翻进人群，战士们一边在山上拼手榴弹一边喊：“真是一锅稀粥啊！”
    天渐渐的黑下来——快八点的时候，四面八方全响起枪声，友军赶到了。随着合击部署的形成，妄想突围的敌人悉数被歼。
