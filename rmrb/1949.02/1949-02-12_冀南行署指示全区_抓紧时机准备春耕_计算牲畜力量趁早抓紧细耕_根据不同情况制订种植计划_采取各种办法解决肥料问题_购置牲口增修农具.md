[Jinnan Electric] The Jinnan Administrative Office instructed all special districts, counties, and municipal governments to seize the opportunity to carry out spring plowing. The instructions began with: "A year's plan starts in spring." The quality of spring plowing directly affects the harvest for the whole year. Especially this spring, there are many tasks, such as war support, land measurement and assessment, road construction, and river management. If we don't seize the time, it will be crowded out by other work, which will cause irreparable losses. Next, the instructions pointed out that the following tasks must be completed as soon as possible: (1) Cultivation: Each county should accurately calculate the amount of draft animals and cultivated land, stipulate a time, and explain that there was no snow last winter. A slight delay will cause it to be missed. The land has thawed, so start plowing and plow all uncultivated land as soon as possible. Based on the experience of winter plowing, organize the masses to exchange labor for labor with grass, feed, grain, spinning yarn, weaving cloth, and making clothes, or exchange fine work for rough work, or half labor for full labor. Or mobilize the masses to find relatives, friends, and nearby draft animals, or use methods such as joint feeding and helping with cow legs to concretely solve the difficulties of the masses in cultivating land. In areas with few draft animals, it is also necessary to organize people to pull plows, and pay special attention to fine plowing when plowing. Plow the cultivated land once, and try to harrow and cover it as early as possible to avoid water leakage, and harrow it while it is still wet. In areas with insect pests, mobilize the masses to dig eggs on grass slopes and roadsides in conjunction with picking up dung and firewood to reduce insect disasters. (2) Hoeing wheat and weeding: Wheat seedlings in clay soil should be hoeed once; areas with no habit of hoeing wheat in sandy soil should also weed, and use an empty harrow or a roller to roll the ground once when it thaws, so that the ground is loosened to promote weathering and change its original state to reduce water evaporation. (3) Planned planting. Each region should formulate a planting plan based on the wheat planting situation and different soil types through mass discussions; cotton-producing areas should plant more cotton and strive to reach 50% of the cultivated land, and sandy land should plant more peanuts, requiring an increase of one to one and a half times. (4) Rapidly prepare and adjust seeds. (A) Local farms and agricultural extension agencies must distribute improved varieties to villages before the 20th day of the first lunar month, but it must be done with the masses' conscious and voluntary use to avoid waste. The original good varieties in various places can be mobilized for free exchange, and technical guidance should be given on planting and seed soaking methods in coordination with sowing. (B) Seeds of oil crops (peanuts, sesame seeds, cotton) should be prepared at the county level. The industry and commerce departments and production promotion cooperatives can investigate public and private stores and oil mills. All peanuts, cotton, and sesame seeds that can be used as seeds can be exchanged, lent, or exchanged to the masses. If there are insufficient or surplus seeds in various places, report to the special district for unified adjustment. The special district should report to the administrative office for adjustment if it feels insufficient or has a surplus. (C) Disaster areas should plant early-maturing crops, such as spring wheat, small beans, "seven-leaf sorghum," and "sixty-day grain returning to the barn." The seeds should be investigated and purchased by the county. (5) Fertilizer: After the beginning of spring, dung should be crushed immediately to send the existing dung to the fields before plowing, and mobilize the masses to topdress in wheat fields, which will benefit the fastest and lay the foundation for sowing wheat stubble. Also organize the masses to buy bean cakes, which can be negotiated by the masses and the oil mill to stipulate a comparative price. And according to different situations, organize the masses to tear down old houses and build new houses, using spring leisure to make fertilizer. In addition, bank loans should be given in kind, as much as possible loaning oil cakes, and returning wheat after wheat or cotton seeds and peanuts after autumn. (6) Draft animals: Each county can formulate a county's purchase plan based on the shortage situation and the wealth of the masses through mass planning, and organize the masses or pass cattle dealers to exchange cloth and cotton for cattle. Large counties should buy seven hundred heads, and small counties five hundred heads, to complete three-tenths to five-tenths. (7) Increase and repair farm tools: Each county must establish one to two farm tool factories in the spring and support the iron industry to manufacture and repair farm tools for distribution to the masses. First of all, emphasize good borrowing and good return, and equal value exchange to keep old farm tools from being damaged. The farm tools seized from struggle must be distributed quickly. Secondly, focus on repairing the old ones and purchase them by the masses according to their needs, or lend them a part. (8) When there is surplus capacity after completing the above tasks, land can be reclaimed, what to reclaim first, and what to reclaim later. The county should make a plan to gradually eliminate raw and cooked wasteland, or plant as much sesame seeds and willow strips as possible on the wasteland. The instructions continued: Spring is mainly for spring plowing, and never neglect spring plowing because of making money from sideline occupations; nor can we relax the leadership of sideline occupations. The two should be combined, such as helping the masses formulate sideline production plans, organize division of labor and cooperation, so that agriculture and sideline occupations are not neglected, and use profits to solve the problems of seeds, farm tools, and fertilizers; organize blacksmiths, carpenters, textile workers, and other handicraftsmen to manufacture farm tools to supply the needs of agricultural production, and develop commerce that can sell native cloth to exchange for cattle, farm tools, and seeds, so that the masses can buy whatever they want. In particular, industrial and commercial departments and production promotion cooperatives in disaster areas should organize disaster relief cooperatives, sell products, supply raw materials, and carry out price limits to solve the lives of disaster victims. The instructions finally pointed out: This spring's democratic movement should be combined with production, and the spring plowing plan and production plan of one village, one district, and one county should be formulated through the People's Representative Conference. Through the People's Representatives, the burden should be fair, and the policies of rewarding labor and protecting production should be publicized through the People's Representative Conference to break the ideological concerns of some farmers and make them actively engage in production. Organize and rectify various mutual aid and cooperation organizations that are based on manpower, livestock, and agricultural tools, and are temporary or long-term and combine agriculture and sideline industries. In leading production, we must oppose both coercion and command and laissez-faire; we must be good at inspiring and guiding, and gradually improving the existing experience of the masses.

　　冀南行署指示全区
  　抓紧时机准备春耕
    计算牲畜力量趁早抓紧细耕
    根据不同情况制订种植计划
  　采取各种办法解决肥料问题
    购置牲口增修农具
    【冀南电】冀南行政公署指示各专署、县、市政府，抓紧时机进行春耕。指示首谓：“一年之计在于春”，春耕好坏直接影响全年收成，特别是今春任务甚多，如战勤、丈地评产、修路治河，如不抓紧，会被别的工作挤掉，那就会造成不可挽救的损失。接着，指示上指出：必须及早完成以下工作：（一）耕地：各县应该精细计算耕畜和耕地多少，规定时间，说明去冬无雪，稍一迟延，就会错过，地已解冻，就要下犁，将未耕土地趁早耕一遍。并根据冬耕经验，组织群众以草、料、粮食、纺线织布做衣服等人工换人工，或以细活换粗活，半劳力换全劳力，或发动群众找用亲戚、朋友、近门耕畜，或用伙喂、帮牛腿等办法，切实具体的解决群众耕地困难。在耕畜少的地区，还有组织人拉犁，耕时要特别注意细耕。已耕之地要耙一遍，尽量早耙早盖，以免走漏水分，并趁湿耙起来。有虫患地区，可动员群众结合拾粪拾柴在草坡道边掘卵，以减少虫灾。（二）锄麦与除草：粘土地之麦苗要锄一遍；沙地无锄麦习惯者也要除草，还要根据土质于解冻时用空耙耙一遍，或用磙轧一遍，使地面松动促其风化，改变其原来状态，以减少水分被蒸发。（三）有计划的种植。各地应根据种麦情况，根据不同土质，要通过群众讨论，制定种植计划；产棉区要多种棉争取达到耕地百分之五十，沙地要多种花生，要求增加一倍到一倍半。（四）迅速准备与调剂种子。（四）各地农场及农业推广机构，必须于旧历正月廿日前将应行推广优良品种分配到村，但必须做到群众自觉自愿的使用，以免浪费。各地原有的好品种可发动群众自由兑换，对种植和浸种方法，要配合下种予以技术上指导。（乙）油料作物（花生、麻子、棉花）种子以县为单位作准备、工商科与生产推进社，可调查公私商店油坊，凡存有可作种子之花生、棉花、大麻子，可换回来，贷或换给群众。各地种子不足或有剩余的报专署统一调剂。专署感到不足或有剩余报行署调剂。（丙）灾区要种早熟作物，如春麦、小豆、“七个叶高粱”、“六十天还仓谷”等，种子用县调查筹购。（五）肥料：立春后应马上捣粪争取犁地前把现有粪送到地里，并动员群众在麦田里上追肥，这样得利最快，且可打下种麦茬的基础。并应组织群众买豆饼，可经群众、油坊双方协商，规定比价。并可根据不同情况，组织群众拆破房盖新房，利用春闲，弄成肥料。此外银行贷实，尽可能贷给油饼，于麦后还麦或秋后还棉籽、花生。（六）耕畜：各县可根据缺乏情形，群众富力，通过群众计划，订出县的增购计划，组织群众或通过牛贩，以布、棉换牛。大县七百头，小县五百头，要完成十分之三至十分之五。（七）增修农具：各县必须于春季建立一处至两处农具工厂，并扶植打铁业，以制造和修理农具，配售给群众。首先强调好借好还等价交换，以保持旧农具不损坏。斗争的农具要迅速分配。其次要着重修理旧的，并根据群众的需要由群众购买，或贷给一部。（八）在作完以上工作，而有余力时，可进行开荒，先开什么，后开什么，县要订出计划，逐步消灭生熟荒地，或尽量将荒地种上大麻子、柳条等。指示继谓：春季以春耕为主，决不要因副业赚钱而忽视春耕；也决不能放松副业的领导。要使两者相结合，如帮助群众订副业生产计划，组织分工合作，使农、副业两不误，用盈利解决种子、农具、肥料问题；组织铁匠、木匠、纺织等手工业者，制造农具供给农业生产需要，发展能够贩卖土布，换回耕牛、农具、种子的商业，使群众打算买啥就有啥可买。特别是灾区工商部门和生产推进社，要组织灾民合作社，推销产品，供给原料，并进行限价平粜以解决灾民生活。指示最后指出：今春的民主运动，要结合生产，通过人民代表会，订出一村、一区、一县的春耕计划和生产计划，通过人民代表，并使负担、相差公平，通过人民代表会宣传奖励劳动和保护生产的政策，打破某些农民的思想顾虑，使其积极从事生产。组织与整顿以人力、牲畜、农具为基础的、临时的或长期的小型的农副业结合的各种互助合作组织。在领导生产中既要反对强迫命令，又要反对放任自流；必须是善于启发、诱导，把群众现有经验逐步提高。
