How to Carry Out the Work of the Communist Youth League?
  The Fourth District Committee of Chahar Sums Up Experience and Makes New Decisions
    The Fourth District Committee of Chahar convened a district committee meeting on January 9 to discuss the resolution of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China on the establishment of the New Democratic Youth League, reviewed the establishment of the League in this special district in connection with this resolution, and made specific decisions. According to the experience of building the League in the past two years, some counties in the Fourth Special District have achieved some results. According to the statistics of Pingshan, Fuping, Xingtang, and Jianping counties alone, 137 rural League branches have been established, with 1,543 League members. There are 21 school branches with 329 League members. This small number of League members with a short League age have already shown the characteristics of youth in various movements: active enthusiasm and playing a backbone role. In Pingshan, 145 League members signed up for the army in the past year. Under the leadership of the League branch, Pingshan established 62 winter schools, accounting for two-thirds of the total number of winter schools in the county. Zhang Chunfang, a female League member from Guxian Village, led the work group throughout the year, and four girls undertook the main labor of the family. League members in school League branches are the most outstanding students, and their exemplary role in all aspects is no weaker than that of party members. These are the results of earnestly implementing the Party's instructions on building the League.
    Upon strict inspection, the District Committee still does not have a sufficient understanding of the importance of building the League. It did not see that the political consciousness of the broad masses of young people has been generally improved through the Party's long-term education and training in various struggles, and the old youth organizations can no longer meet the needs of these advanced and active elements. The leadership still unilaterally believes that "it's enough to have a youth organization," and the understanding of the nature of the League is also vague. Specifically, youth cadres at all levels cannot be equipped in a timely manner, which is delayed again and again (at present, the special district level has been fully equipped). Youth cadres are rarely helped. Some youth cadres do not know where to start due to their weak abilities and lack of experience. They feel that there is nothing to do, call themselves "free people" and feel depressed, and are unwilling to do youth work; confusion has also occurred below because of this. Many villages in Lingshou turned the original youth rescue association into the Youth League in name only. Some schools adopt the method of voting and public discussion to recruit League members, some of whom set the entry conditions too high, or mystify the entry into the League, and do not dare to publicize it openly.
    Based on the review, the District Committee has made the following decisions to further strengthen the leadership of youth work:
    1. Party committees at all levels must attach importance to youth work and include the work of building the League as one of the agenda items. Designate a special person in the Standing Committee to lead the Youth Committee and its work. Youth Committee secretaries who meet the conditions of the Party Committee should participate in the Party Committee at the same level. Those who do not participate in the Party Committee must also be allowed to participate in the Party Committee's discussion of general work and policy meetings. Party committees at all levels should care about all issues in the political life and daily study of Youth Committee cadres.
    2. In the shortest possible time, each county should quickly select outstanding youth cadres to fill vacancies according to the established number of personnel. Under the call of the entire Party to do youth work, those who volunteer to do youth work, as long as they meet the conditions (according to the Central Committee's decision), the Party Committee and its department shall not refuse. At the latest by the end of January, each county must equip the county cadres. The main cadres of the district League committee must be members of the district party committee, and those who do not meet the conditions should be adjusted. One-third of the adjustments should be made by the end of January, and gradually completed before the "May Fourth" Youth Day. In order to cultivate youth cadres in a planned way, the District Party School has a special youth class, and each county can also adopt the method of mobile training classes to train youth cadres in a planned way.
    3. Organize and establish League branches according to different situations: For branches that meet the conditions, the task in the future is to develop, consolidate, strengthen education, and improve its role, so that it can better and more unite young people and the masses outside the League; when the League was originally established, the methods were cautious, the procedures were serious, and it had played a role, but later collapsed due to lack of leadership, the policy should be to restore and reorganize. Those who do not meet the conditions of League members should be cleaned out, and a large number of new active elements should be absorbed to participate, so as to consolidate the League organization; if the policy was wrong when the League was originally established, it was formalistic, and it can be re-established today to lay a new foundation.
    4. How to build the League: Villages with branches and outstanding young party members can rely on the branch, and use good young party members as the foundation (League branch secretaries who meet the conditions can participate in the branch committee). Or find pure and promising young laborers as the foundation through the branch (League branch secretaries who are not party members can attend discussions on youth work and general work at the branch committee). Appoint a branch committee member to often help the work of the League. Villages without branches or with branches that have not been reorganized can combine the work of ending land reform to reorganize the Party; and discover active young people in the work as the foundation for building the League.
    In any case, young people (including party members) who serve as the foundation for building the League must be trained first.
    5. Steps and specific requirements for building the League: Before "May Fourth", each county should first do a good job in one or two districts (not referring to the entire district). Youth cadres with weak abilities should be led by the county Youth Committee to focus on typical districts or villages (combined with land reform and party rectification) to learn from experience and cultivate cadres. Other districts can also try to build a few if conditions permit. Before "May Fourth", each district should establish at least three League branches. Primary schools and normal schools should establish branch League departments before the end of March if conditions permit.
    6. Combine building the League with the central work: The current focus of work is to combine production to end land reform and party rectification, and the work of building the League must be carried out in conjunction with the central work. Therefore, all young people and League members are required to earnestly implement the Party's policies, widely publicize to the masses, adhere to the truth, and speak fairly in the land reform completion and party rectification movement. When disputes arise due to resolving the remaining issues of land reform, League members should persuade family members and relatives to make necessary concessions in order to achieve unity and production goals. League committees at all levels should discover active elements at any time in the central work as targets for developing League members.
    7. Youth cadres should strengthen the study of Marxism-Leninism and Mao Zedong Thought, study culture, and improve political theory. They should also closely contact the broad masses of people and humbly learn from the masses. They should carry forward a lively and clean work style, and truly become the core of uniting young people, and constantly examine themselves to prevent independent actions, committing adventurism and the occurrence of ideas that are divorced from the masses.

### 如何开展青年团工作？　察哈尔四地委总结经验作出新决定

　　如何开展青年团工作？
  　察哈尔四地委总结经验作出新决定
    察哈尔四地委于一月九日，召开地委会议，讨论了中共中央关于建立新民主主义青年团的决议，并联系本专区建团工作进行检查，且做出具体决定。两年来经过建团的经验，四专区有些县已获得了一些成绩，仅据平山、阜平、行唐、建屏四县的统计，已建立了农村团支部一百三十七个，团员一千五百四十三人。学校支部二十一个，团员三百二十九人。这批为数不大、团龄很短的团员，已经在各种运动中，表现了青年的特色：积极热情，起骨干作用。一年来平山有一百四十五个团员报名参军。平山在团支部领导下建立起冬校六十二座，占全县冬校数的三分之二。古贤村女团员张春芳领导的拨工组贯彻全年，四个女孩子负担了家庭的主要劳动。校团团员都是最优秀的学生，各方面的模范作用，并不弱于党员。这都是认真的执行上级党建团指示的结果。
    严格检查起来，地委对建团的重要性还是认识不足的，没有看到广大青年，经过党的长期教育和各种斗争中的锻炼，其政治觉悟已获得普遍提高，旧有的青年组织已不能满足这些先进积极分子的需要。而领导上还片面认为“有个青年组织就算了”，对团的性质也认识模糊。具体表现在各级青年干部不能及时配备起来，一拖再拖（目下专区级已配备齐全）。对青年干部很少帮助，一些青年干部因能力弱经验少，不知从何下手，觉着没事可做，自称为“自由民”而感到苦闷，不愿做青年工作；下面亦因此发生混乱现象。灵寿不少村庄把原有的青救会换汤不换药的变成青年团。某些学校以票选和公议的办法吸收团员，有的是入团条件提的过高，或把入团神秘化，不敢公开宣传。
    地委根据检讨为了进一步加强对青年工作领导特作出以下决定：
    一、各级党委必须重视青年工作，把建团工作列为议事日程之一。在常委中指定专人领导青委会及其工作。青委书记凡合乎党委条件者均应参加同级党委，不参加党委者也必须让其参加党委讨论一般工作及政策的会议。各级党委应关心照顾青委干部的政治生活和日常学习中的一切问题。
    二、于最短时间，各县按编制名额迅速挑选优秀的青年干部来补充缺额。在全党做青年工作的号召下，有志愿做青年工作者，只要够条件（按中央决定）党委及其所在部门不得拒绝。最迟至一月底，各县必须把县干部配备起来。区团委会主要干部，必须是区委委员，不够条件者应进行调整，一月底调整三分之一，“五四”青年节前逐步调整齐全。为了有计划的培养青年干部，地委党校专设一青年班，各县也可采用流动训练班的方式，有计划的训练青年干部。
    三、根据不同情况整理与建立团支部：够条件的支部，今后任务是发展、巩固、加强教育，提高它的作用，使它更好更多的团结团外青年及群众；原来建团时，方式慎重，手续认真，并曾起过作用，后因没人领导而垮了的，方针应是恢复整理，不够团员条件的应洗刷出去，并大量吸收新的积极分子参加进来，巩固团的组织；若原来建团时方针就错误，形式主义，今天可重新建立，另打基础。
    四、如何建团：有支部又有优秀青年党员的村，可依靠支部，以好的青年党员作基础（团支书够条件者可参加支委会）。或通过支部找出纯洁而有培养前途的劳动青年作基础，建立团的组织（团支书如系非党员，支委会讨论青年工作和一般工作时可列席参加）。推定一个支委经常帮助团的工作。无支部或有支部而未经整党的村庄，可结合着土地改革结束工作把党整好；并从工作中发现积极青年作为建团基础。
    不管在哪种情况下，凡作为建团基础的青年（党员在内）必须先给以训练。
    五、建团步骤和具体要求：在“五四”以前各县先搞好一两个区（不是指全区）。能力弱的青年干部由县青委带领有重点的搞典型区或村（和土地改革整党结合），以吸收经验培养干部。其他区有条件的也可试建几个。“五四”前各区至少要建立三个团支部。完小、师范有条件的于三月底以前把支团部建立起来。
    六、建团和中心工作结合：当前工作中心是结合生产进行结束土地改革与整党，建团工作必须在中心工作中结合进行。因此要求所有青年和青年团员要在土地改革结束和整党运动中，认真贯彻党的政策，广泛向群众宣传，坚持真理，说公道话。解决土地改革遗留问题因而发生纠纷时，团员应劝说家庭亲友作必要的让步，以达团结、生产目的。各级团委会应在中心工作中随时发现积极分子，作为发展团员的对象。
    七、青年干部应该加强学习马列主义——毛泽东思想，学习文化，提高政治理论。更应密切联系广大群众，虚心的向群众学习。发扬活泼、廉洁的作风，使自己真正成为团结青年的核心，随时检查自己，防止闹独立性，犯先锋主义及脱离群众的思想发生。
