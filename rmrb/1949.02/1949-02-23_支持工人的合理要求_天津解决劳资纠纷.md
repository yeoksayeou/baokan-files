Xinhua News Agency, Tianjin, February 21st: The Tianjin Municipal People's Government and the Tianjin Office of the North China Federation of Trade Unions, based on the principle of developing production and benefiting both labor and capital, have resolved more than 40 labor-management disputes. Before the liberation of Tianjin, many private factories failed to pay workers' wages on time, and factories such as Beiyang Textile Mill even colluded with the Kuomintang reactionary military police to carry out repression. After liberation, the workers knew that "the skies had cleared" and they could reason things out. With the Lunar New Year approaching and every family urgently needing money, they again demanded that the factories pay their wages. However, many factories delayed payment under the pretext of "no cash" or "inability to sell finished products," attempting to delay or reduce payments. As a result, labor-management disputes occurred one after another. In the half-month from the liberation of Tianjin to the end of the Lunar Year, such disputes occurred in more than 40 factories, including Beiyang and Dasheng Textile Mills, Zhongtian Electric Factory, Dafeng Chemical Factory, and Beiyang and Danhua Match Factories. The Tianjin Municipal People's Government and the Tianjin Office of the North China Federation of Trade Unions mediated these disputes. Working groups dispatched by the Tianjin Office of the North China Federation of Trade Unions to each factory carried out specific tasks, and all disputes have now been resolved fairly and reasonably. When resolving these disputes, each working group supported the workers' reasonable demands, pointing out that it was the capital side's responsibility to pay wages on time and that any past actions of delaying for any reason or even colluding with the Kuomintang reactionary military police to suppress workers were wrong. As the Lunar New Year was approaching and the amount of wages owed by the capital side was not easy to calculate immediately, the capital side should first advance a necessary portion of the wages to the workers. As for certain factories that were indeed experiencing slow sales of finished products and insufficient cash flow, the working groups could introduce these factories to trade companies to request the purchase of their finished products. For example, at the Dafeng Chemical Factory, the workers requested a temporary loan of 5,000 yuan in People's Currency per person based on their owed wages, but the capital side only agreed to advance 1,000 yuan. At the market price at that time, 1,000 yuan could not even buy two bags of flour, making it extremely difficult for a family of four or five to maintain a short-term livelihood. After repeated mediation by the working group, the workers, in order to take care of the development of production, agreed to make the greatest concession, and the capital side also agreed to increase the amount of the advance. As a result, both sides agreed to a temporary loan of 4,000 yuan per person. After these disputes were resolved, workers at the Dongya Enterprise Company said, "We never thought that we workers would have this status today. In the past, no one cared if we were hungry and cold, but now the Communist Party and the People's Government take care of us everywhere. We will never forget this!" A female worker, Yao Ke＠, said, "January 15th (the day of Tianjin's liberation) is a sunny day, and I will never forget it." In the process of resolving labor-management disputes, some capitalists in a few factories not only lacked sincerity but also engaged in deceptive and divisive behavior. For example, when a certain company sold goods to a trade company, it deliberately raised prices and then turned around and told the workers, "It's not that I don't want to pay wages early, but the price isn't right." After the workers discovered similar tactics, they were exposed one by one, making the capital side realize that the deceptive tactics they used in the past no longer work today.

### 支持工人的合理要求　天津解决劳资纠纷

　　支持工人的合理要求
  　天津解决劳资纠纷
    【新华社天津二十一日电】天津市人民政府和华北总工会天津办事处，根据发展生产、劳资两利的原则，解决劳资纠纷四十余起。天津解放前，有许多私营工厂不按时支付工人工资，北洋纱厂等甚至勾结国民党反动军警实行压制。解放后，工人们知道“天晴了”，可以讲理了；加以旧历年关到来，家家急需钱用，又向厂方提出照发工资的要求。但不少厂方则以“没有现款”或“成品无法推销”等等为借口，拖延时间，企图迟发或少发。于是劳资纠纷连续发生。自天津解放到旧历年底的半个月中，此种纠纷先后在北洋、达生纱厂，中天电机厂，大丰化学厂，北洋、丹华火柴厂等工厂中发生四十余起。天津市人民政府与华北总工会天津办事处当对这些纠纷进行调解，并由华北总工会天津办事处派往各厂的工作小组具体执行，现均已公平合理地解决。各个工作小组在解决这些纠纷时，支持工人们的合理要求，指出：按时照发工资是资方的当然责任，过去任何借故拖延甚至竟勾结国民党反动军警镇压工人的行动，都是不对的。由于年关逼近，而资方拖欠的工资数目一时不易算清，资方应先借支必要的一部分工资给工人。至于某些工厂确系成品推销不畅、现金不敷周转者，工作小组可介绍各厂向贸易公司请求收购各厂成品。如大丰化学厂，工人们按自己应得工资，要求每人暂借人民券五千元，但资方只答应先借一千元，按当时市价，一千元连两袋面粉都买不到，一个四五口人的家庭，绝难维持短期生活。经工作组反复调解，工人们为照顾发展生产，允作最大的让步，资方亦答应提高借支额，结果双方同意每人暂借四千元。在这些纠纷解决后，东亚企业公司工人说：“想不到我们工人还会有今天的地位。过去挨饿受冻没人管，现在共产党、人民政府处处照顾咱，我们一辈子也忘不了！”女工姚克＠说：“一月十五（天津解放日）是晴天的日子，我永不会忘掉这一天。”在解决劳资纠纷过程中，会有少数工厂的资本家不但缺乏诚意，而且有欺骗挑拨行为。如某公司到贸易公司出售货物时故意抬高价格，反过来又向工人表示，“不是我不愿早发工资，而是价钱不妥”。类似这种手段，经工人们发觉后，均被一一揭破，使资方知道过去惯用的欺骗手段，今天已经行不通了。
