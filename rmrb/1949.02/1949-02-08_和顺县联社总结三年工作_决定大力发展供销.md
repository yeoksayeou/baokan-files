[Taihang Telegraph] After conscientiously reviewing and summarizing its work over the past three years, the HeShun County Cooperative has decided to vigorously develop its supply and marketing businesses. The cooperative has achieved considerable success in its work over the past three years, with more than 2,800 members and over 100 million yuan in share capital. It has operated a substantial amount of supply and marketing business, supporting the production of many people. Last year, it ran a textile training class where more than 2,570 women learned to weave. It supplied 514 looms and 5,105 spinning wheels (including village cooperatives), and launched the "Hundred-Day Textile" campaign last summer. Last winter, it organized transportation and other production activities, earning over 180 million Jiao coins. Labor and capital jointly operated a coal kiln, earning 928 shi of rice; the carpentry factory initiated the harvesting of mountain products by the masses, enabling them to earn 310 shi of rice; it helped the masses in Gouzhang in the first district to overcome the disaster. Last summer, it regulated 150 shi of grain, and last autumn, it regulated 30 shi of wheat seeds. This spring, it bought more than 630 plows and 1,700 plowshares, solving the difficulties of the masses in obtaining seeds and farm tools. This winter, it bought back 106 head of livestock from northwestern Shanxi and sold them to the masses, helping to solve some of the difficulties in obtaining animal power. The necessities supplied to the masses were all sold at slightly lower than market prices. The main shortcomings that exist are that the county cooperative cadres' view of serving the masses is not yet fully clear, and there is still a phenomenon of simply engaging in commercial pursuit of profits. The organization of members' production is also not done well enough. It has not done a good job in supplying the necessities of the members, let alone promoting the products of the members well. Secondly, it has not supported village cooperatives well, and even competed with each other when buying hemp. Recently, at a meeting of more than 80 member representatives, after reviewing these shortcomings and errors, the county magistrate explained to everyone why cooperatives are organized and what cooperatives actually do. He particularly emphasized the issue of vigorously organizing supply and marketing, so that everyone began to fully awaken. The past idea of ​​purely pursuing dividends was negated, and it was clarified that the county cooperative should mainly organize the production of members. It was also decided that from this period onwards, no more dividends would be distributed, and the county cooperative was asked to buy livestock for the members immediately. Some member representatives even looked forward to the future and said that in the future, when the county cooperative becomes stronger, it can also buy machines for everyone and greatly develop production. The representatives all agreed with this view. Some representatives asked the county cooperative to provide news to the village cooperatives to prevent unscrupulous merchants from exploiting farmers in the mountains. Finally, it was decided that the county, district, and village cooperatives should establish commercial intelligence reports. Some county cadres also made specific self-criticisms for this. For example, the auditor said: "When the head of the Xicun cooperative came to buy goods, I was afraid that he would not be able to pay the money immediately, so the price of the goods I calculated was even higher than that of small merchants. As a result, he did not buy the goods, and he never came again, and the money he owed was not paid." The meeting decided that the future direction of the county cooperative should be: (1) mainly to organize members' sideline production through district and village cooperatives, supply members with the necessities for production and life, and promote the sale of products. (2) At present, it is necessary to combine the spare funds of the masses to buy livestock for the masses. (3) The price of the masses' materials as shares should be slightly higher than the market price. (4) The county, district, and village cooperatives should establish commercial intelligence reports to prevent unscrupulous merchants from speculating. (5) A meeting of member representatives should be held every six months. After the meeting, the representatives talked and said: We have to tell our members when we go back, hurry up and buy shares to buy livestock.

　　和顺县联社总结三年工作
  　决定大力发展供销
    【太行电】和顺县联社在认真检查总结了三年来的工作之后，决定大力发展供销业务。该社三年来工作有相当成绩，现有社员二千八百多人，股金一万万多元。曾经营了不少供销业务，扶助了不少群众生产。去年开办纺织训练班，二千五百七十多个妇女学会了纺织，供给织布机五百一十四架，纺车五千一百零五辆（村社在内），开展了去夏的百日纺织。去冬组织运输及其他生产赚得冀钞一万万八千多万元。劳资合办煤窑，赚米九百二十八石；开办的木工厂，发动群众砍山货，使群众赚米三百一十石；帮助一区沟掌群众渡过了灾荒。去夏调剂粮食一百五十石，去秋调剂麦种三十石，今春买犁六百卅多个，铧一千七百口。解决了群众种子与农具的困难。今冬到晋西北买回牲口一百零六头卖给群众，帮助解决了部分畜力困难。在供给群众必需品上，都是稍低于市价卖出的。现存的缺点，主要是县社干部对为群众服务的观点还不完全明确，仍存在单纯经营商业追逐利润的现象，组织社员生产还做得很不够。没有做好供给社员的必需品，更没有很好的推销了社员的生产品。其次是没有好好扶植村社，甚至在买麻时还互相竞争。最近在八十多人的社员代表会上检讨了这些缺点错误以后，该县县长给大家讲解了为啥组织合作社，合作社到底干啥。特别强调了大力组织供销的问题，使大家开始完全清醒起来。否定了过去单纯为着分红的思想，明确了县社主要应组织社员生产。并决定从这期开始，不再分红，叫县社马上给社员买牲口。有的社员代表并瞻望前途说，将来县社力量大了，还可以给大家买机器，大大发展生产。这个意见，代表们都赞成。有的代表则要求县社供给村社消息，防止奸商到山里来剥削农民。最后决定县、区、村社建立商情通报。有的县干部还为此专门作了检讨。如审计说：“西村合作社长来买货，我怕他当下给不了钱，算的货价比小商人还高，结果他未买上货，再也不来了，欠的帐也没给了。”会议对县社今后方针决定为：（一）主要是通过区、村社组织社员副业生产，供给社员生产、生活上的必需品，推销生产品。（二）在目前要结合群众游资，给群众买牲口。（三）群众物资入股，折价要比市价稍高些。（四）县、区、村社，要建立商情通报，防止奸商投机。（五）半年召开一次社员代表大会。会后代表们交谈着说：咱回去可要告咱们社员，赶快入股买牲口哩。
