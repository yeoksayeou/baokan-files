　　Xinhua News Agency, Central Plains, 30th: A temporary representative conference was held on the 11th and 12th of this month for workers from all public and private enterprises and various industries in Kaifeng. At the conference, the Kaifeng City Trade Union Federation Preparatory Committee was formally established. More than 130 representatives and guests attended the meeting. Deng Zihui, Deputy Political Commissar of the Central Plains Military Region, Wu Zhipu, Mayor of Kaifeng, and Liu Jie, Deputy Secretary of the Kaifeng Municipal Committee of the Communist Party of China, all attended and delivered speeches (Deputy Political Commissar Deng's speech is in another item today). Regarding the future tasks of the trade union, Zhao Min, head of the Yu-Wan-Su General Trade Union Office in Bian, gave a summary report to the conference on the 12th. He elaborated that the future tasks of the Kaifeng trade union are: First, to unite all working people and democrats in the city, support the People's Liberation Army, and strive to liberate the people of the whole country. To this end, we should publicize everywhere and expose the "peace" deception of the reactionary Nanjing government; at the same time, we must establish contact with workers in the Kuomintang-controlled areas through various relationships, and support and assist their liberation struggle. Second, step up production and protect workers' lives. In public enterprises, workers should cherish their own enterprises, help manage factories, and improve production. At the same time, the trade union should cooperate with the factory to gradually change the unreasonable wage system left over from the Kuomintang rule, re-evaluate according to the principles of both public and private interests, based on ability, technology, and labor efficiency, and implement a cross-progressive wage system. In private factories, the policy of mutual benefit between labor and capital should be implemented, resolutely oppose factory oppression and abuse of workers, restore and develop social productivity, and gradually improve workers' lives. For unemployed workers, the trade union should assist the government in setting up factories and running workers' schools to help them find employment and resume work, or temporarily study, and then introduce them to work later. Third, the trade union should run workers' clubs or staff training courses to give workers the opportunity to learn and improve their political, cultural, and technical level. Factories should give workers a certain amount of study time. Fourth, establish cooperatives, hospitals, etc., and develop workers' welfare undertakings. Fifth, the Trade Union Federation Preparatory Committee should help various industries and factories establish trade unions, widely establish workers' organizations, and recruit members. In order to facilitate the division of labor and leadership, the Preparatory Committee should set up a Public Factory Trade Union Committee, a Private Industry Trade Union Committee, and a Handicraft and Coolie Trade Union Committee, and set up offices of the Preparatory Committee in each district to absorb more members. The Workers' Representative Conference finally elected Liu Jie, Zhao Min, Liu Ziliang, Li Chunsheng, Gao Shengru, Zhai Fu, Li Zhongyi and other twenty-nine people as official preparatory members of the Kaifeng City Trade Union Federation Preparatory Committee, and Shen Chao and other seven people as alternate members. Zhao Min and Liu Ziliang were elected as the director and deputy director of the Preparatory Committee. The Preparatory Committee officially started work on the 13th.
