　　Introduction to Botou City Gongyihe Cooperative
    Lin Yuan
    The Gongyihe Cooperative is the collective household of seven types of porter workers in Botou City. It was established in December of the 35th year of the Republic of China (1946), with a total of fifty-six members. Two people are selected from among them to manage the cooperative's affairs, without wages, eating at home. The cooperative has no other expenses. The daily wages earned by the porters are divided equally between the workers and the managers. The cooperative's profits are also divided equally. Therefore, the cooperative's managers and porter workers are labor cooperatives of an allotted-work nature. (Editor's note: The strength of the porter workers varies. Whether it is fair to distribute wages equally is worth considering.)
    The cooperative's main business is transportation and sales. It trades in salt, grain, coal dust, mats, etc. Porter workers carry goods for the cooperative without wages. Sometimes they hire large carts to transport and sell goods outside, so their business is very profitable. The porter's union is also located in the cooperative. The cooperative has become a gathering and resting place for the workers, and also a place for them to study literacy, settle accounts, and distribute wages at night. Therefore, the union and the cooperative are inseparable and have a very close relationship.
    In the past, porter workers did not have the habit of saving money to establish a household. They spent the money they earned without thinking about tomorrow. After the establishment of the cooperative, they were encouraged to save their daily wages, invest in shares when due, or deposit them in the cooperative, gradually building up their household. For example, when member Yang Fusun first invested, his share capital was one hundred and sixty yuan (new currency, same below). He received more than seven hundred yuan in several dividends. After the settlement, he continued to add shares and now has five hundred yuan in share capital. Recently, each worker earns an average of more than fifty yuan in wages per day. Twenty-two people have voluntarily started on August 20th of last year to contribute five yuan of their wages every day to raise funds to buy eight dan of red grain. They also have a surplus of two thousand five hundred yuan and plan to buy more grain. They will distribute it at the end of the year or when they have difficulties, to avoid future grain price increases.
    In March of the year before last, there was less outside work for porters, leaving a surplus of labor. Since there was no goods to carry, the cooperative took out a portion of its capital and lent it to them without interest, to transport grain from the Bohai area for the public-owned Dongxing and Taixing stores. Twelve or thirteen carts set out every day, pushing for eighteen days. Each cart earned an average of fifteen yuan per day (equivalent to two dou and five sheng of rice at the time). The money earned from transporting grain and the wages earned by porters at home were distributed equally. In addition, they pushed firewood from the countryside, chopped it in the city, and then sold it, returning the capital to the cooperative after the push was completed. This is how they adjusted the labor force when there was less outside work. Last spring, when grain prices rose, the cooperative used the accumulated twenty dan of corn and ten dan of wheat to solve the family living difficulties of members who had no goods to carry or were particularly poor. The cooperative lent it to them at a price lower than the market price, lending out a total of nine dan of corn. Later, when there was work to carry, it was all returned. Therefore, the members are very concerned about the cooperative and actively solicit business for the cooperative and help with odd jobs in the cooperative, because the cooperative and their personal interests are inseparable. In addition, the cooperative has good contacts with other public-owned stores. They received support from the Taixing store. For example, when transporting grain for Taixing, if the market price fell, Taixing would not ask them to compensate for the transportation fee. Therefore, the workers voluntarily helped Taixing. During the war preparations in April last year, the workers provided their own food and drink to load and transport three hundred bags of grain for Taixing and pulled them out of the city to store them.
    However, the cooperative also has the following shortcomings: 1. The method of collecting shares is mechanically simple, which limits the development of business. They insist on equal shares, not accepting more and not allowing less, and distributing dividends equally. They believe that this reduces disputes, and no one suffers losses or takes advantage. The main reason is that they are a labor cooperative, helping the cooperative without wages. The staff is allotted work and receives the same wages and dividends as everyone else, making it simple and easy to settle accounts. The disadvantage is that it does not attract outside investment, does not allow outsiders to invest, and does not pay interest on members' savings deposited in the cooperative. Therefore, it limits the expansion of funds and prevents the business from developing further. Now, a few members have raised funds to open a fish shop elsewhere. More than twenty members have raised funds to buy red grain and store it in the cooperative, but it has little connection with the cooperative's business. 2. The main business is only the transportation and sale of coal dust, salt, mats, and other miscellaneous goods. Sometimes they hire large carts to do itinerant sales. There is no connection between the production and life of the members' families. Since last year, due to the prosperity of the salt market, porter workers have had a lot of income and no surplus labor. The cooperative has not timely changed its business and tried to organize the production of members' families to make full use of all aspects of strength. 3. The system is not sound enough. Their regulations state that members with difficulties can temporarily borrow shares below one hundred yuan, but there are no clear measures. Individual overdue debts are not subject to interest. The food expenses incurred by managers when they go out for business can be reimbursed, but there is no record in the cooperative, which can easily breed fraud and waste. It is also not in line with the principle of open accounts.
    Based on the above situation, the close cooperation between the cooperative and the union to establish a collective household for the workers and organize mass labor production and workers' spare-time production is very good. If the restrictions on investment are corrected and reasonable labor-capital dividend and share collection methods are adopted, it will have great development prospects.

　　泊头市工义和合作社介绍
    林远
    工义和合作社是泊头市七种脚行工人的集体家务。自民国三十五年十二月成立，社员共有五十六人。他们中推出两个人经营社务，没工资，在家里吃饭，社内也没有其他开支，脚行每天所得工资，工人和经营人平均分，合作社所赚红利，也平均分。因此，该社经营人和脚行工人是拨工性质的劳力合作。（编者按：脚行工人劳力强弱不同，如工资平均分配，是否公平，值得考虑）
    该社业务主要是搞运销。贩运盐、粮、砟炭、席等。脚行工人给社里扛脚，不要工资，有时雇大车往外跑运销，所以他们的业务很获利。脚行工会也设在社里，合作社成了工人的集合、休息地点，也是他们晚上学习识字、结帐分工资的场所，所以工会和合作社分不开，关系十分密切。
    过去，脚行工人没有积蓄建立家务的习惯，挣到钱就吃，不管明天。合作社成立后，吸引他们每日将所得工资积蓄起来，到期入股，或存在社里，逐渐建立起家务。如社员杨复顺刚入股时，股金一百六十元（新币下同），几次分红曾分出七百多元，在结帐后又陆续添股，现有股金五百元。最近每个工人每天平均挣工资五十余元，有二十二个人，又自动从去年八月二十日开始每天抽出工资五元，集资买下八石红粮，另有余款二千五百元，还准备再收买粮食，到年底时，或有了困难时再分，避免以后粮食上涨了做难。
    前年三月间，脚行外活少了，剩余下劳动力，没有脚扛，于是社里拿出一部分资本，无息借给他们，给公营东兴和太兴商店从渤海区贩运粮食。每天有十二、三辆小车出发，推了十八天，每天每辆小车平均赚十五元（折合当时二斗五升米），运粮赚的钱，和在家扛脚工人所得工资，都大家平均分；另外，还从乡村推运木柴，到本市劈了再卖，推完了归还合作社的资本。这样调剂外活少时的劳动力。去年春天，粮上涨了，合作社用积存的二十石玉米、十石小麦解决没有脚扛或特别贫苦社员的家庭生活困难。社里低于市价赊借给他们，共借出九石玉米，后来，等有脚扛时，都归还了。因此，社员对合作社非常关心，都主动的给合作社招揽生意，帮助社内做零活，因为合作社和他们个人的利益是分不开的。此外，合作社和其他公营商店联系很好。他们受到太兴商店的扶持，例如：给太兴贩运粮食时，行市落了，太兴不叫他们赔脚费。因此，工人也自动的给太兴帮忙，去年四月备战时，工人自备吃喝给太兴装运三百多袋粮食，并且拉出市外，存放起来。
    但该合作社还存在以下几个缺点：一、集股办法的机械简单，限制了业务的开展。他们坚持着入股平均，多入不收，少入不行，一样的分红。认为这样减少纠纷，谁也不吃亏，谁也不沾光。主要的因为他们是劳力合作，给社里帮忙，不要工资，职员是拨工性质，和大家一样批工资批红利，结帐时简单容易。缺点是不吸收游资，不叫外人入股，社员另有积蓄者，存放合作社内，也不行息。因此，限制了资金的扩大，业务不能更大开展。现在，已有少数社员另集资在别的地方开了个鱼栈；二十多个社员集资收买红粮，存在社内，但与合作社业务没什么牵连。二、主要业务只贩运砟炭、盐、席及其他杂货，有时雇大车跑行商，社员家庭的生产和生活没有联系。去年以来，因盐市繁荣，脚行工人收入很多，没有剩余劳动力，合作社没有及时转变业务，想法组织社员家属生产，充分利用各方面的力量。三、制度不够健全，他们的规定：社员有困难股金在一百元以下，可临时赊借，没有明确的办法；个别赊欠较久者，也不行息。经营人因业务外出时，所用伙食可以报销，但社内没帐，容易滋生舞弊，浪费等现象；也不合帐目公开原则。
    根据上述情形，合作社和工会工作密切配合，建立了工人们的集体家务，组织群众劳动生产和工人的业余生产，这是很好，如果再纠正限制入股，及采取合理的劳资分红和集股的办法，将是有很大发展前途的。
