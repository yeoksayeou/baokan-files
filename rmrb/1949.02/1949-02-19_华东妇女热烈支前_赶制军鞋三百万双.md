Xinhua News Agency, East China, 17th: The task of producing three million pairs of military shoes was gloriously assigned to the broad masses of working women in Lunan, Jiaodong, Xuzhou, Jinan and other places last month. With the close cooperation of local party and government organs and relevant departments such as cooperatives and promotion societies, the above task has been rapidly deployed in various places. This time, the East China leading organs mobilized women to make military shoes, continuing to rely on the experience of organizing women to make military shoes in East China in recent years, ensuring that every woman who makes military shoes, as well as factories or shops that contract to make military shoes, can obtain a certain wage and profit - six catties of coarse grain (excluding raw material costs). The 1.2 million catties of rags and more than 40,000 catties of hemp collected by the East China Financial and Economic Office and the Industry and Commerce Bureaus, Supply Departments, and Production Departments directly under the Shandong Provincial Government have been decided to be allocated to various places to help women in various places solve the difficulty of raw materials for making military shoes. Women in various places can buy the above raw materials at low prices through cooperatives and promotion societies. Because various places have adopted the above methods to organize people to make military shoes, the broad masses of working women in East China's urban and rural areas feel that making military shoes is not only a glorious task, but also a new way for them to make a living, so their enthusiasm for making military shoes has greatly increased. When the Women's Federation and the cooperatives distributed tasks, many women asked to be assigned more pairs. Lu Wenxiang, a young woman from Shiqiao Village, asked to make thirteen pairs alone. Women work day and night to make military shoes, competing with each other in quantity and quality, and even keep their eyes red without rest. In many villages, not only women rush to make military shoes, but also the elderly and children actively participate in making military shoes, making it a widespread upsurge for women, the elderly and children throughout the village to practically support the front. In Dianzi Village, Qiguan District, Rizhao County, men and women implemented a division of labor: men made hemp ropes, and women sewed soles and uppers. The village made 670 pairs of shoes in three months, earning a net profit of 2,588,800 yuan, and bought a large amount of grain and dried melon, solving the difficulties of rural famine.

　　华东妇女热烈支前
  　赶制军鞋三百万双
    【新华社华东十七日电】三百万双军鞋的任务已于上月间光荣地落到鲁中南、胶东、徐州、济南等地广大劳动妇女的肩上。上述任务，在各地党政机关和各有关部门如合作社、推进社等密切配合下，已在各地迅速布置就绪。这次华东领导机关发动妇女做军鞋，继续依据华东近几年来组织妇女做军鞋的经验，保证每个做军鞋的妇女以至包做军鞋的工厂或商店能得到一定的工资与利润——六斤粗粮（原料费除外）。华东财政经济办事处和山东省政府直属各地工商局、供给部、生产部所收集的一百二十万斤破布和四万余斤麻，已决定全部拨发各地，以帮助各地妇女解决做军鞋的原料困难。各地妇女通过合作社、推进社可以低价买得上述原料。由于各地采取了上述办法组织人民做军鞋，华东广大城乡劳动妇女觉得做军鞋不仅是光荣任务，而且还是她们新的谋生之道，因而做军鞋的热情大大高涨。在妇女联合会和合作社分配任务的时候，许多妇女要求多分配给她几双，石桥村青年妇女吕文香一个人要求做十三双。妇女们白天黑夜赶制军鞋，互相竞赛，比数量，比质量，甚至双眼熬得通红也不休息。许多村庄不仅妇女赶做军鞋，而且老人和儿童也积极参加做军鞋，使做军鞋成为全村妇女、老人和儿童实际支援前线的广泛热潮。日照县七关区店子村，男女实行分工：男的打麻绳，女的纳鞋底和上帮。全村三个月做鞋六百七十双，得净利二百五十八万八千余元，买进了大批粮食和瓜干，解决了农村灾荒的困难。
