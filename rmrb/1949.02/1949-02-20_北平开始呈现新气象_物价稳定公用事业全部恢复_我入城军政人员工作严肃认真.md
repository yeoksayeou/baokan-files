Xinhua News Agency, Beiping, 18th: Beiping has only been liberated for two weeks, and the whole city has already begun to show a new look. Following the announcement by the Beiping Municipal People's Government on the 4th that it was taking over the pseudo-Beiping Municipal Government, twenty district governments were immediately established. The serious and conscientious work attitude and hard-working spirit of the Military Control Commission and the People's Government personnel have been praised by the majority of citizens. Since the entry of the People's Liberation Army into the city, prices have become increasingly stable, and the supply of daily necessities is also extremely abundant. Coal, grain, oil, and salt are being transported in a steady stream; on the 10th alone, over 700,000 catties of grain, 200,000 catties of white oil, 300 tons of salt, and 1,300 tons of coal were transported. Public utilities in the city have been fully restored, and the current daily water supply is 32,000 tons. All 20,000 telephones are now in operation. The power supply is extremely sufficient, with a daily power consumption of 23,000 kilowatts in the city. The power required for motivation and lighting in the city is now sufficient. Before liberation, the city's daily power consumption was over 30,000 kilowatts, but citizens still suffered from power outages in different districts every other day, because at that time, the Kuomintang military and government agencies and special agent organizations stole and occupied a large amount of electricity, using it for cooking and boiling water, and did not pay the electricity bills. This phenomenon has now been completely eliminated. Seven tram lines have been restored, with a daily ridership of around 25,000 people. In the past, Kuomintang soldiers and special agents did not buy tickets; they accounted for at least half of all passengers every day, and citizens were often squeezed and unable to board the trams, causing the tram company to suffer heavy losses. Now, these "ticketless passengers" have completely disappeared. The Pinghan North Section, Pingzhang, Beining, Pingmen (Tou Gou), and Pingmi (Yun) railways have all been opened to traffic, which is very convenient for passengers. Many citizens are carrying simple luggage, getting on the people's trains, and happily going to visit their families and relatives in the old liberated areas. From the 10th, Beiping has begun postal services with the five major liberated areas of North China, East China, Northeast China, Northwest China, and Central Plains. On the 13th alone, 26,811 letters were sent from Beiping, and 11,484 letters were received. Revolutionary slogans and cartoons are posted on all major traffic arteries in the city, attracting a large number of viewers all day long. The PLA garrison troops and propaganda teams from major middle schools have been conducting propaganda on the streets for several days. They perform Yangko dances and street dramas, and hold lectures. Citizens are going to the streets in groups from their homes, rejoicing and singing with the propaganda teams, and celebrating the liberation.

　　北平开始呈现新气象
  　物价稳定公用事业全部恢复
    我入城军政人员工作严肃认真
    【新华社北平十八日电】北平解放刚刚两周，全市已开始呈现新气象。继四日北平市人民政府宣布接管伪北平市政府之后，二十个区政府即告建立。军管会和人民政府工作人员的严肃认真的工作态度和吃苦耐劳的工作作风，受到广大市民的赞扬。自解放军入城后，物价日趋稳定，日用必需品的供应亦极为充裕。煤、粮、油、盐均源源运到，仅十日一天就运到粮食七十余万斤，白油二十万斤，食盐三百吨，煤炭一千三百吨。市内公用事业已全部恢复，现自来水每日可供水三万二千吨。两万部电话机都已通话。电力供应极为充足，城内每日受电量为两万三千基罗瓦特、市内所需动力与照明都已足用。解放前，城内每日受电三万余基罗瓦特，但市民每隔一日，仍受分区停电之苦，因那时国民党的军政机关和特务机关大量偷窃和霸占电力，煮饭用电，烧水也用电，而且都不缴电费，这种现重现在已完全消灭了。电车已有七条路线恢复，每日乘客均在两万五千人左右。过去国民党军人和特务都是不买车票，他们每天至少占全部乘客的一半，市民常常被挤得不能登车，电车公司也赔累不堪。现在这种“无票乘客”已完全绝迹了。平汉北段、平张、北宁、平门（头沟）、平密（云）等铁路都已通车，乘客成称方便。许多市民携带着简单的行装，坐上人民的火车，愉快地去看望在老解放区的家人和亲友。从十日开始，北平与华北、华东、东北、西北、中原等五大解放区已开始通邮。仅十三日一天，从北平发出的平信即达二万六千八百一十一件，收进平信一万一千四百八十四件。城内各交通要道上，都贴满了革命的标语和漫画，成天吸引着大量的观众。解放军卫戍部队和各大中学的宣传队连日在街头宣传、他们表演秧歌和街头剧，举行着讲演会。市民们成群地从家庭走上街头，和宣传队一起欢乐，一起歌唱，庆祝解放。
