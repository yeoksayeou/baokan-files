On the Communist Attitude Towards Labor
Replies to Readers from the Soviet Labor Newspaper
By M. Ilyushin Translated by Liu Shui

Comrade Roslyakov from Ash City, Chelyabinsk Province, wrote to the "Labor" newspaper:

I have just returned from demobilization from the Soviet Army. When I was still in the army, I had no doubt that after returning to peaceful creative labor, respect and honor would be found everywhere. I am a Communist Party member, so I should not despise any work. No matter where I work, it will be beneficial to society everywhere.

However, among us there are some comrades who have received several years of education, but they strive to find a more satisfactory "favorable position." Of course, it is necessary to seek better work, but to become a general, you must first be a soldier!

Not long ago, in a conversation with comrades, I said that I wanted to be an "ordinary laborer." Why? Because I have no specialized skills. "What are you doing!?" I heard an old comrade who worked in a bakery doing light work and was "proud" of himself say to me, "Can't you find some easier work to do? Especially since you are a Communist Party member and have received a considerable education. Haven't you dropped enough bombs in the air force?"

That is to say: There are some comrades, seemingly my comrades, who think that being an "ordinary laborer" lowers their status.

Every Soviet person should do as much as possible. No one can prevent him from doing so—the road to learning any skill is open, but to do great things, one must work hard, persevere, and study, not to make the work simple and beneficial, but to be more beneficial to society.

Please advise if this is correct.

Comrade Roslyakov, you are very right, although you do not express your meaning completely accurately.

First of all, you are right that laborers are respected and honored everywhere in our country. The great October Socialist Revolution liberated the previous slave labor. Socialism has elevated laborers to an unprecedented height. Comrade Stalin said: "The workers and peasants who tirelessly and diligently build factories, mines and railways, collective farms and state farms, create all the benefits of life, and supply the world with food and clothing – these are the true heroes and creators of the new life." To work for the interests of one's society is a matter of glory, courage, and heroism.

The term "ordinary laborer" that you mentioned no longer exists in our dictionary, or if it does, it is just a saying based on old habits. We only say skilled workers or auxiliary workers, not "ordinary laborers." Why? The reason this phrase exists in the language is because our country was generally under the rule of landlords and capitalists who despised human labor, especially physical labor. The term "ordinary laborer" contains a profound exploitative attitude towards those engaged in unskilled heavy physical labor.

In the Soviet state, all labor that is beneficial to society, including auxiliary labor, is respected by the people. All this labor is valued and needed by our people. In fact, if a lathe worker does not have other lathes assembling finished products for him, can he work at his own lathe? If the workshop of a machine manufacturing plant is not supplied with raw materials and semi-finished products by other enterprises, can it work? And these products need to be loaded into carriages, unloaded, and then transported into the workshop in advance. Who are the laborers in this process? They are skilled workers and auxiliary workers who master machinery (cranes, handling equipment, etc.), that is, loaders and unloaders. Without them, the enterprise cannot operate.

You wrote, "Every Soviet person strives to do a greater job," which is correct. Not only should every Soviet person do more and better, but so should the entire Soviet state, with the Communist Party as the guiding force. The Party and the government are striving to replace heavy manual labor with machines and mechanisms (which can drastically increase productivity and facilitate and improve labor conditions).

The mechanization of heavy labor is the guiding principle for the development of all sectors of the national economy. Communism is designed on the basis of the most advanced technology, which can generate high productivity and ensure abundant production. This means that we will have more machines and mechanisms every year, and more people who master these machines, further reducing unskilled labor. The occupations of manual loaders and diggers will disappear with time, just as the river boatmen are now useless.

However, unskilled or auxiliary workers still exist temporarily, and what's more, they are still an important link in our overall production cause.

We do not adopt egalitarianism for labor remuneration, because the socialist principle is: From each according to his ability, to each according to his work. Therefore, it is obvious that the income of auxiliary workers is less than that of skilled workers, because the latter have received vocational training over a relatively long period of time. At the same time, the determination of wage rates in the Soviet Union depends not only on the degree of skill, but also on the intensity of labor. Therefore, the Soviet government gives first priority to the wage levels of workers in industries such as coal, metallurgy, and timber. In capitalist countries, the opposite is true, and wages in more burdensome labor production sectors are given secondary importance. Capitalists use the threat of unemployment to force workers to agree to these conditions. The Soviet government, which is interested in continuously improving labor productivity, gives every worker the opportunity to acquire or improve their skills and increase their wages at the same time.

It is inevitable that you are willing to go to the enterprise as an auxiliary worker when you do not have skilled labor. According to your letter, you want to further acquire a specialized profession in production. This is not only a right, but also a direct obligation of every Soviet worker. The Soviet state has spared no effort and funds to train skilled labor cadres. The law of the post-war Five-Year Plan stipulates the training of 7.7 million new skilled workers and the improvement of the work skills of 13.9 million people. Everyone knows how large the scale of activity of Soviet youth worker schools is, and how encouraged and assisted is the study of specialized technical schools and institutions of higher learning by workers who do not leave production.

Soviet people love their profession and are proud of their work achievements. They are happy to realize that this house was built by their own hands, this finished product was created by them, and their labor is intertwined in these products. Therefore, the more skilled their labor, the more labor results, and the more creative satisfaction labor gives to Soviet patriots.

The vast majority of our workers consciously work with creative enthusiasm. These are the true creators of communism.

The person you wrote about who talked to you is only seeking personal gain and looking for a "favorable position." Yes, there are still such mediocre people here. Not all people in our society are conscious warriors of communist advancement. And there are still people who are guided by the old bourgeois morality in their lives, just as Lenin wrote, they want to get more from the state and give less to the state. Such people who are indifferent to the interests of society look for personal benefits first everywhere.

Secondly, you are a Communist Party member, and the person who talked to you only sees some small possibilities, and "arrogantly" prides himself on being in a favorable position. Mediocre people often use their own standards to measure everything. Such people do not understand that Communist Party members first and foremost express a high degree of responsibility for their work, strict demands on themselves, and self-sacrificing labor. During the war, Communist Party members stood at the forefront to charge and shout, and in the period of peaceful construction, they are also the pioneers of production. Because Communist Party members have a responsibility to be models of courage, love of labor, and honesty for the country.

The interests of the people, the determination to serve the people, and the willingness to spare their labor and life – these are the most valuable characteristics of the spiritual outlook of Communist Party members. For passionate patriots of the Soviet state – Bolsheviks – there is nothing more noble than serving the people and serving the great cause of communism. The great teachers and leaders of the workers, Lenin and Stalin, are the highest examples of infinite loyalty to the motherland and the interests of the motherland for all Communist Party members and all workers.

Soviet society requires every citizen to work sincerely within the scope of their work, to protect social property as if protecting their own eyes, and to enthusiastically protect the interests of the people. Genuine laborers in socialist society cannot regard state-owned stores, warehouses, and canteens as "favorable places." Soviet people working in these agencies that provide for the daily needs of residents should show special vigilance in protecting the state's material wealth. At the 17th Congress of the Party, Comrade Stalin pointed out: "Soviet trade is our own Bolshevik cause, and trade workers, including store workers, if they work honestly, then they are the pioneers of our revolutionary Bolshevik cause."

That is to say, the crux of the matter is not the place of work, but those who are prepared to turn any place into a "favorable position," and such people make personal plans at the expense of the blood and sweat of the laborers.

Where do these individual pocket enthusiasts of ours who neglect honest labor come from? These are people whose ideology is full of capitalist remnants and bourgeois ideas.

The socialist country is not born perfect. It arises and develops in the midst of fierce struggle against the old. The old remnants in people's consciousness, the "birthmarks" of capitalism, cannot be eliminated at once with the change of social system.

Capitalist society is based on private property, on universal competition and war of mutual destruction. "Man is a wolf to man" – this is the foundation of bourgeois morality.

The Bolshevik Party and the Soviets, trade unions, and Communist Youth League under its leadership have been continuously carrying out mass education work to eliminate the capitalist remnants in people's consciousness. This arduous work has achieved great results. Millions of Soviet people treat social property, their labor, and their obligations with a communist attitude. But this does not mean that the old remnants in consciousness have been finally eradicated. We still have loafers, embezzlers, and many are thieves of social assets.

Obviously, we cannot tolerate these capitalist "birthmarks" in our society. To overcome it, we need struggle – a tenacious day-to-day struggle. We need systematic and resolute mass education work. The most important method of education is criticism and self-criticism.

In our Soviet society, Comrade Zhdanov said: The antagonistic classes have been eliminated, and the struggle between the old and the new, and the development from the lower to the higher that comes with it, is not carried out in the form of fighting against antagonistic classes and capitalism, as in capitalist society, but in the form of criticism and self-criticism. And this criticism and self-criticism is the real driving force of our development and a powerful weapon in the hands of the Party.

The old will not die on its own. We must also resolutely and bravely expose the actual keepers of toxins, and constantly fight against things that hinder our rapid progress. Especially if your old colleague is working in a state-owned bakery and deceiving and stealing from the state because it is profitable – this fact cannot be ignored under any circumstances. Exposing private thieves will benefit the society that you, as a patriot, care about.

　　论共产主义的劳动态度
  　苏联劳动报答读者问
    Ｍ·伊留申作  流水译
    罗斯列科夫同志自切列宾斯克省阿什城给“劳动”报社写道：
    我刚自苏军复员归来。当我尚在部队中时，我不怀疑：回复到和平创造的劳动以后，到处都可得到尊敬和荣誉。我——是共产党员，所以不应该轻视任何工作。不论在哪里工作，到处都将有益于社会。
    但是我们中间有这样一些同志，他们受过几年的教育，但他们力求找到更如意的“有利地位”。当然，需要求得更好的工作，但是，要成将军，必须先当兵！
    不久前我和同志们谈话中，我说我想做“普通劳工”。为什么呢？因为我没有专门技能。你怎么搞的！？——我听到一位在面包铺做轻闲工作而“俨然”自傲的老同志给我说，——难道你不能找到轻易一些的工作做吗？尤其是你是一个共产党员，且也受过相当的教育。难道你在航空队里炸弹还没有拉够吗？
    这就是说：有着这样的一些同志，似乎是我的同志，他们认为做“普通劳工”是降低自己的身份。
    每一个苏联人都应当尽可能做大一点的事情。这谁也不能禁止他这样做，——学习任何技能的道路是敞开着的，但是做大事情必须勤劳、顽强的工作和学习，不是为了在那里工作要简单和有利，而是在那里可以更有益于社会。
    是否正确，敬希示复。
    罗斯列科夫同志，您说得很对，虽然并不完全确切表示您的意思。
    首先，您说得对的是：在我国劳动的人到处受尊敬和享有荣誉。伟大的十月社会主义革命解放了先前的奴隶劳动。社会主义把劳动的人提高到空前未有的高度。斯大林同志说：“在孜孜不倦埋头苦干地建设工厂、矿山和铁路、集体农场和国营农场，创造一切生活的福利，供给世界吃穿的工人和农民们——这才是新生活的真正英雄和创造者”。为自己社会利益而劳动——这是光荣、勇敢与英雄主义的事情。
    您所说的“普通劳工”这字眼，在我们字典里已没有了，如果还有，这不过是按旧习惯的说法。我们只说熟练工人或辅助工人，而不说“普通劳工”。为什么呢？这句话之在语言中，那时我国还在一般地鄙视人的劳动而特别是鄙视体力劳动的地主和资本家统治之下。“普通劳工”一语，含有对于从事非熟练的体力重劳动者底深刻的剥削态度。
    在苏联国家中，一切有益于社会的劳动，其中包括辅助劳动，都受到人们的尊敬。这一切劳动为我们人民所重视和需要。实际上，旋盘工人如果没有别的车床装成品给他，他能否在自己车床边工作呢？机器制造厂的车间如果别的企业不供给原料和半制品，它是否能够工作呢？而这些产品还需要人事先装入车厢，卸下而然后运入车间。谁是这一过程的劳动者呢？这就是掌握机械（起重机、搬运装置等）的熟练工人和辅助工人即装卸工人。没有他们则企业不可能行动。
    您这样写道：“每一个苏联人都力求做大一点的工作”，这是对的。不仅每一个苏联人应当做得更大更好，而且共产党为指导力量的整个苏联国家也是如此。党与政府正力求以机器、机械（这些东西可以猛烈提高生产力、可以便利和改善劳动条件）来代替繁重的手工劳动。
    重劳动工作的机械化，——这是发展国民经济一切部门的指导路线。共产主义是在最先进的技术的基础上设计的，这先进技术能产生高度的生产力和保证丰富的生产品。这就是说，我们每年将有更多的机械和机器，并有更多掌握这些机械的人，更加减少非熟练的劳动。用手力劳动的装卸工人和掘地工人的职业将随着时间而消失，这正如现在是已无用的河岸拉船夫一样。
    但是现在非熟练的或是辅助工人还暂时存在，还不仅此，他们而且还是我们生产总事业中的重要环节。
    我们对于劳动报酬不是采取平均主义的，因为社会主义原则是：各尽所能，各取所值。因此显然，辅助工人的收入要少于熟练工人，因后者是在比较长时间内受过职业训练。同时，在苏联的工资率的规定，不仅看其熟练程度，而且看其劳动的轻重。因之苏联政府对于在如下这些工业部门，如煤炭、冶金、木材等工业部门的工人，工资水平提到第一位。在资本主义国家中则恰恰相反，比较繁重劳动生产部门的工资，却被让在次要的地位。资本家是用失业的威胁来迫使工人同意这种条件的。而利害地关切不断提高劳动生产力的苏联政府，给了每个工人以获得或者提高自己熟练程度，并同时增加其工资的可能。
    如果您没有熟练劳动时，您愿意到企业中去当辅助工人，这是很必然的。按照你信上说，您想进一步获得生产的专门职业。这不仅是权利，而且也是每一个苏联工人的直接义务。苏联国家曾不惜一切力量和资金来训练熟练劳动的干部。战后五年计划的法律规定训练七百七十万新的技术工人，提高一千三百九十万人的工作熟练程度。大家知道，苏联青年工人学校的活动规模，是多么的巨大，专门技术学校及高等学校中不脱离生产工人的学习，又是如何地受到鼓励和帮助的。
    苏联人爱好自己的职业，以自己工作的成就而自豪，他愉快地意识到：这座房屋是由他们两手建造起来的，这件成品是由他创造出来的，在这些产品中交织着他们的劳动，因之他的劳动愈熟练，其劳动成果愈多，而劳动给予苏联爱国主义者创造的满足也就更多。
    我们绝大多数劳动者，就是这样自觉地带着创作热潮来工作的。这就是共产主义真正的创造者。
    您写的那位和您谈话的人，他只是求得个人的好外，寻找“有利的地位”。是的，这样的庸人在我们这里还有着。并不是我们社会的所有人都是共产主义先进的自觉的战士。而且也还有在自己生活中以旧的资产阶级道德为指导的人，正如列宁所写过的那样，他是向国家要得多，对国家给得少的人。对社会利益漠不关心的这种人，他到处首先找得个人的好处。
    其次在于：您是一个共产党员，和您谈话的那个人只见于些小的可能，而“俨然”以在有利地位自居，庸人们是常拿自己的尺度来衡量一切的。这种人不懂得：共产党员首先而且最高度的表示对自己工作底崇高的责任心，对自己严格要求和自我牺牲的劳动。在战时共产党员曾站在前头冲锋喊阵，在和平建设时期，他们也是生产的先驱。因为共产党员有责任成为为国家而勇敢、爱好劳动和诚实的模范。
    人民的利益，为人民服务的决心，不惜自己的劳力和生命——这就是共产党员精神面貌中最宝贵特点。对于苏维埃国家热情的爱国主义者——布尔塞维克党人说来，除了为人民服务为共产主义的伟大事业服务，没有比这更崇高的了。劳动者的伟大导师和领袖列宁与斯大林，乃是对一切共产党员及一切劳动者无限忠于祖国与祖国利益底最高的典型。
    苏联社会要求每一个公民在自己工作范围内诚恳地工作，要象爱护自己眼珠一样来保护社会的财产，热心地保护人民的利益。社会主义社会真诚的劳动者不能把国家的商店、仓库、饭厅看成是“有利的地方”。苏联人在这些为居民生活日常迫切需要服务的机关中工作，应当表现对于保护国家物质财富底特别的警觉性。在党第十七次代表大会上，斯大林同志指出：“苏联的贸易是我们自己的布尔塞维克的事业，而贸易工作者其中也包括商店工作者，如果他们正直地工作，那么他们是我们革命的布尔塞维克事业的先驱”。
    这就是说，问题中心不在于工作地点，而在于那些准备把任何地方变为“有利地位”的人，这种人是以牺牲劳动者的血汗利益来作个人打算的。
    我们的这些忽视正直劳动的个人口袋热心家，是哪里出来的呢？这就是思想意识中充满资本主义残余和资产阶级观念的人。
    社会主义国家不是生下来就完善的。它是在与旧的残酷斗争中发生与发展起来的。人意识中旧的残余，资本主义“黑痣”不是随着社会制度的改变而可一举消灭的。
    资本主义社会是基于私有财产之上，基于普遍的竞争和自相残杀的战争之上的。“人就是吃人的狼”——这就是资产阶级道德的基础。
    布尔塞维克党及在其领导下之苏维埃、职工会、少共团曾不间断地进行着群众的教育工作，以至消除人们意识中的资本主义残余。这一艰巨工作获得了很大的效果。千百万苏联人都以共产主义的态度对待社会财产，对待自己的劳动和对待自己的义务。但这还不是说，意识中旧的残余就已最后地根除了。我们还有二流子，贪污分子，还不少是社会资产的偷盗者。
    很显然，我们是不能容忍在我们社会中之有这些资本主义“黑痣”的。为了克服它，就需要斗争——顽强的逐日的斗争。就需要有系统的坚决的群众教育工作。教育的最重要的方法，乃是批评与自我批评。
    在我们苏维埃社会中，——日丹诺夫同志说道：业已消灭了敌对阶级，新旧之间的斗争，并随此而来的从低级向高级的发展，这不是如象在资本主义社会里那样，是同敌对阶级和资本主义作斗争的形式来进行，而是以批评与自我批评的形式来进行的。而这种批评与自我批评乃是我们发展的真正动力与党手中的强大武器。
    旧的不会自我死亡。还必须坚决与勇敢的揭穿毒素的实际保持者，不断地与妨碍我们迅速前进的事物作斗争。特别是如果您的旧同事因为有利可图而俨然地在国家面包铺中工作而欺骗盗窃国家，——这种事实无论如何不能漠然置之。揭穿私偷者将对于你作为爱国主义者所关心的社会带来益处。
