　　Suburban Soldiers and Civilians

　　The People's Liberation Army are Our Own People
    To get to the front line positions of the People's Liberation Army from Beiding Village to Xiaoguan in the west of Dicheng, one must cross a major road (the highway from Beiping to Zhangjiakou, five miles from Deshengmen in Beiping City). The two of us were walking forward excitedly when suddenly a middle-aged woman hurried up from behind. Curious, we turned around and saw her staring at us anxiously. She called out to us, breathless, "Comrades! When you cross the big road, walk along the hard ground by the west riverbank, and be careful! The heartless Kuomintang army has buried small cannons (referring to landmines), and they have already blown up a dozen civilians in the past few days!" We thanked her repeatedly, "Thank you, Sister!" She said happily, "We are all our own people, and we have been looking forward to you liberating Beiping." After she finished speaking, she walked towards the path going north, but she kept turning around to look at us. At this moment, an ear-splitting explosion came from the southeast. It turned out that the Kuomintang army outside the city was carrying out the order of the People's Liberation Army: to completely remove all the landmines buried by the Kuomintang army intact within today. A few landmines were difficult to remove because of the frozen soil, and with the approval of the People's Liberation Army, they were allowed to pull the pins and let these landmines destroy themselves.
　　Farmers and Policemen
    These days, Kuomintang policemen are still standing guard at Deshengmen. But these policemen are not as fierce as they used to be. A farmer from the northern suburbs wanted to go into the city to visit relatives, but the guard at the gate would not let him in, and they ended up arguing. Before the People's Liberation Army tightly surrounded Beiping, people entering and leaving the city gates were always bullied by the police and military police. But now, this farmer has changed. His courage has grown many times over! He dares to get angry at the Kuomintang police and dares to openly resist. He warned in a stern voice, "Now is not the time for you to be fierce. Haven't you opened your eyes to see that there are People's Liberation Army soldiers behind us!..." The policeman didn't wait for him to finish speaking and hurriedly apologized: "Brother! Please don't be angry. It's not my fault. It's not that I don't want to let you into the city, nor am I deliberately making things difficult for you. I am also following orders from my superiors! I heard that you can enter and exit freely tomorrow, please come back tomorrow!" The farmer's anger had not yet subsided, and he immediately retorted the policeman's words: "Superiors?! Who is afraid of your superiors now!" The policeman smiled apologetically again and said, "Yes! Yes!" Although the farmer did not get into the city, he was not discouraged. He seemed to have won a victory and laughed with his neighbors in the village: "The police are much 'more honest' when you mention the People's Liberation Army!"
　　A Teacup
    All the villages outside Beiping City are filled with People's Liberation Army soldiers. The millions of people here are praising the strict discipline of the People's Liberation Army.
    An old woman said: "The People's Liberation Army soldiers living in the west room of my house are really well-behaved! When they borrow something from me, they always stand outside the door and call 'Granny!' 'Granny!' Look how kind they are! If you don't ask them to come in, they always stand still." Others said: "It is true that the People's Liberation Army does not take a single needle or thread, they don't even take a single blade of grass." A communication soldier from a certain company accidentally broke a teacup belonging to the landlord. He was extremely upset. He held the broken teacup in both hands and stood at attention in front of the landlord for a long time, unable to speak. The landlord was an old lady whose son was doing small business in Beiping. She thought this comrade wanted to borrow something, so she spoke for him: "Aren't you making pancakes today? Do you want some oil? Come, I'll get it for you." Hearing this, our eighteen-year-old communication soldier lowered his voice and said: "Granny, I accidentally broke your teacup, I'm so sorry, I'll pay you for it!" The landlord would not let him pay for it no matter what. The communication soldier said: "Things borrowed must be returned, and things damaged must be compensated. This is the discipline of the People's Liberation Army, and every soldier must abide by it. Granny, don't think it's too little!" As he spoke, he took money out of his pocket. Both sides pushed back and forth, unable to resolve the matter. Just then, a village official came in, and he mediated: "Comrade! If he insists on paying, just pay a little less!" But the communication soldier resolutely stuffed his only money into the landlord's hand, and only then did he breathe a sigh of relief and hurry back to the company headquarters.

　　平郊军民
    张磊
　　解放军是自己人
    从北顶村到地城西小关解放军前线阵地去，必须横过一条大马路（北平通张家口的公路，离北平城的德胜门有五里地）。我们二个人正兴奋的向前走着，突然一个中年妇女从背后快步赶来，我们好奇的回过头去，她的目光紧张地注视着我们，气喘呼呼地叫住我们说：“同志！你们到大马路西河边拣硬持持的地方走，看着一点！没良心的国民党军队，他们埋着小炮（指地雷），前些日子已经炸着十几个老百姓！”我们连声道谢：“大嫂，谢谢你！”她欢喜的说：“我们都是自己人，早盼望你们打北平哩。”她说完，向北去的小路走了，但还不断侧过身来探望。这时东南方向，传来震耳爆炸声，原来城外的国民党军，正在执行解放军的命令：限定今天一天内把国民党军埋设的地雷全部完好的起出，少数地雷由于泥土的冻结，起出困难，经过解放军的批准，允许拉弦，让这些地雷自己毁灭。
　　农民和警察
    这几天，德胜门照旧站着国民党警察。但这些警察不象过去那样凶横了，北郊一个农民想进城里去探亲，守门警察不准他进去，结果吵起来。在解放军没有把北平紧紧包围以前，人民进出城门，没有不被警察宪兵欺压的。可是现在，这个农民变了，他的胆子不知大了多少倍！他敢对国民党警察发怒，敢于公开反抗。他厉声警告：“现在不是你厉害的时候了，你没有张眼看看，后面都是解放军！……”警察没有等他说完，连忙赔不是：“大哥！请别生气，这不能怪我，不是我不让你进城，更不是我故意和你作难。我也是奉上级命令！听说明天可以自由进出了，你老明天再来吧！”这个农民的气还没有平静，他一下就把警察的话顶回去了：“上级？！谁还怕你的上级呢！”警察又赔笑脸说：“是！是！”这个农民虽然没有进得城去，却并不垂头丧气。他好象打了一个胜仗，回到村里和邻居笑谈着：“一说解放军，警察‘老实’多了！”
　　一个茶杯
    北平城外所有的村子都住满了解放军。这里的千万人民，都在称赞解放军的纪律严明。
    有个老太婆说：“我家西屋住的解放军，真是按规矩！他们向我借东西，总是站在门外面叫‘大娘！’‘大娘！’你看人家多亲呀！你没有叫他进来，他老是站着不动。”还有的说：“解放军不拿一针一线真是不假，他们连一根草棍，也不拿。”某连一个通讯员同志，一不小心，把房东的一个茶杯打了，他难过极了，两手捧着那个破茶杯向房东立正好久，也说不出话来。房东是位老大娘，儿子在北平做小买卖，他以为这个同志要借什么东西，就先替他说了：“你们今天不是烙饼吗？想要点油不是？来我给你们拿去。”听这一说，我们这位刚满十八岁的通讯员，才低声的说：“大娘，我不小心，把你家茶杯打了，太对不起，我赔你钱！”房东无论如何不让他赔钱，通讯员同志说：“借物要还，损物要赔，这是解放军的纪律，我们每个军人都要遵守的。大娘，你别嫌少！”他说着就从口袋里掏钱，双方推来让去，无法解决。恰巧进来一位村里办公的人，他调解说：“同志！他在要赔，就少赔几个钱吧！”但通讯员坚决把他仅有的钱，塞到房东大娘手里，这才松了一口气，赶紧跑回连部去。
