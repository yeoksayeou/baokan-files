Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 21st: The question of whether there is any difference between the words and actions of the Guangxi clique leaders and war criminals Li Zongren and Bai Chongxi and those of Chiang Kai-shek and Gu Zhutong has aroused people's interest in discussion.

People say that there is no difference between Chiang Kai-shek talking about peace from January 1, 1949, and Li Zongren talking about peace from January 22 of the same year and month, as both are talking about peace. Chiang Kai-shek never issued orders such as freedom of speech or cessation of special agent activities, while Li Zongren issued these orders, which is a difference. However, Li Zongren's orders were all empty promises, not only were none of them implemented, but the people were even more severely oppressed. The Nanjing authorities even closed down the Peace Promotion Association, and the Shanghai authorities massacred striking workers. Bai Chongxi is just like Gu Zhutong. Gu Zhutong ordered Liu Zhi to blow up the Bengbu Huaihe River railway bridge on the Jinpu Railway. Bai Chongxi is also ordering Zhang Zhen to prepare to blow up the Changtaiguan Huaihe River railway bridge on the Pinghan Railway and the tunnel project at Wusheng Pass. Based on two and a half years of experience, the people north and south of the Yellow River deeply know that the barbarity of the Guangxi army is even worse than that of the Chiang army.

People骂 (mà, scold) Chiang Kai-shek as a running dog of American imperialism. Chiang Kai-shek is used to hearing this and never argues. People骂 (mà, scold) Li Zongren as a running dog of American imperialism. Li Zongren is not used to hearing this and hurriedly steps forward to argue. For example, in his "Telegram to Mao Zedong" published through the Central News Agency on January 27, Li Zongren said: "Your side's broadcast repeatedly stated that the government's advocacy of peace this time is a conspiracy between the government and a certain country. This view is based on some kind of prejudice." Here, Li Zongren not only seeks to exonerate the Li Zongren government after January 22, but also seeks to exonerate the Chiang Kai-shek government before January 22. People know that Chiang Kai-shek was ahead of Li Zongren in the matter of "advocating peace."

Chiang Kai-shek was a fierce god yesterday, and he is still a fierce god today. Li Zongren, Bai Chongxi, and their Guangxi clique were fierce gods yesterday, but today they are somewhat like smiling tigers.

When Chiang Kai-shek lies, they are mostly empty, such as "returning power to the people" and "I have always wanted peace," not allowing people to grasp any specific things in his words. Li Zongren appears clumsy in this matter, making it easy for people to seize his pigtails. For example, in his "Telegram to Mao Zedong," he said: "The current government has shown its sincerity for peace in words and deeds. All the demands of the people across the country in the past, such as the release of political prisoners, opening up freedom of speech, and guaranteeing the people's freedom, are being implemented step by step. The facts are all there, how can it be said to be false?" People say: "There are no facts at all, how can it be said to be true?" Li Zongren said: "The facts are all there, how can it be said to be false?" Li Zongren is a person with such a foolishness.

But Li Zongren also has advantages over Chiang Kai-shek. On the issue of whether war criminals should be punished, Chiang Kai-shek and his die-hards never say that they can be punished. They either do not speak, such as Chiang Kai-shek's "Resignation Proclamation" on January 21, which does not mention a single word about the CCP's eight articles; or they express opposition, such as the remarks made by Lei Zhen, Zhu Jiahua, Pan Gongzhan, and others. They fundamentally oppose treating war criminals as a problem to be discussed. Sun Ke is also similar to these people, saying that the terms of peace talks must be "fair and reasonable," meaning he opposes punishing war criminals. Li Zongren is not like this, he both agrees and opposes, which is the unique thing about Li Zongren.

In his statement on January 22, Li Zongren said: "The government is willing to start negotiations on the eight conditions proposed by the CCP." This means that Li Zongren's government is willing to immediately start negotiating the CCP's condition of punishing war criminals and the other seven conditions, giving you a little sweetness to eat first. Six days later, Li Zongren's tone changed, and it changed drastically. On January 27, 1949, the acting president of the Kuomintang reactionary traitorous government said in his "Telegram to Mao Zedong": "The government has admitted that the eight conditions proposed by your side can be used as the basis for peace talks, and all issues can be discussed and decided in the negotiations. Before the two sides have begun negotiations, to demand that the other side must first implement a certain condition, then how can it be called peace talks? If past grievances and wrongs are overemphasized, then revenge will never end. Alas, my compatriots, I am afraid that there will be no survivors, and Mr. and I will both be condemned by the nation for a thousand years." Oh dear, Li Zongren's move is powerful, this shot is no small matter. However, Li Zongren's marksmanship is still just something from the Xiaozhuge Guangxi tutorial, and China has its own Sun Tzu's Art of War to break it. As for "demanding that the other side must first implement a certain condition before the two sides have begun negotiations," it is because the Nanjing Kuomintang reactionary traitorous government, since its military defeat was like a landslide, has been demanding negotiations like a bereaved parent. The CCP said, okay, wait until we are ready and you can come and talk. The war criminals said, no, we must start talking immediately. The CCP said, you are idle and bored, let us give you a job to do, you go and arrest a batch (naturally not all) of war criminals. This is the process of the story. Later, the CCP changed the arrest to surveillance, which was considered a major concession, and the war criminals calmed down and stopped making noise. This is a later story, not to mention. Let's talk about January 27, Li Zongren said again that grievances and wrongs should not be overemphasized, that is, not to distinguish war responsibility and not to punish war criminals. Even if a "tragic catastrophe" occurred south of the Yellow River to the Yangtze River and north of the Yellow River to the Songhua River (note: this statement is found in Acting President Li's proclamation on January 22, 1949), that would not be anything. If you must punish war criminals, then the supporters of the war criminals will want to retaliate. This kind of retaliation may reach a terrible extent, that is, none of the compatriots in the country can eat, and they will all die. In this way, you Mao Zedong and I Li Zongren will both be judged by our nation (note: since everyone is dead, why is there still a nation, to be investigated) as criminals for a period as long as a thousand years. Fortunately, you only suffer for a thousand years, and after a thousand and one years, you will be a good man again, which is considered Acting President Li's grace.

People, please see, Li Zongren is so fickle, both agreeing to negotiate the punishment of war criminals and disagreeing to implement the punishment of war criminals. His feet are on two boats, which is the difference between him and Chiang Kai-shek.

### 战犯蒋介石李宗仁区别何在？  一个是凶神恶煞，一个是象笑面虎！

　　战犯蒋介石李宗仁区别何在？
    一个是凶神恶煞，一个是象笑面虎！
    【新华社陕北二十一日电】桂系首领战争罪犯李宗仁白崇禧的言论行动，究竟是否和蒋介石顾祝同辈有区别的问题，引起了人们谈论的兴趣。
    人们说，从一九四九年一月一日起蒋介石谈和平，从同年同月二十二日起李宗仁谈和平，两个人都谈和平，这是没有区别的。蒋介石没有下过如象言论自由，停止特务活动等项命令，李宗仁下了这些命令，这是有区别的。但是李宗仁的命令全是空头支票，不但一样也没有实行，而且人民被压迫的更厉害了。南京方面连和平促进会也被封闭了，上海方面屠杀了罢工工人。白崇禧则活象顾祝同。顾祝同命令刘峙炸毁了津浦路蚌埠淮河大铁桥。白崇禧也正在命令张轸准备炸毁平汉路长台关淮河大铁桥及武胜关的隧道工程。积两年半之经验，黄河南北的人民深知桂系军队的野蛮，较之蒋系军队有过之无不及。
    人们骂蒋介石为美帝国主义的走狗，蒋介石听惯了，从来不申辩。人们骂李宗仁为美国帝国主义的走狗，李宗仁没有听得惯，急急忙忙地起来申辩。例如李宗仁在一月二十七日经过中央社发表的“致电毛泽东”里面说：“贵方广播屡谓，政府此次倡导和平为政府与某国勾结之阴谋，此种观点系基于某种成见而来。”这里，李宗仁不但替一月二十二日以后的李宗仁政府求洗刷，而且替一月二十二日以前的蒋介石政府求洗刷。人们知道，“倡导和平”这件事，蒋介石在前，李宗仁在后。
    蒋介石昨天是凶神恶煞，今天也是凶神恶煞。李宗仁白崇禧及其桂系，昨天是凶神恶煞，今天则有些象笑面虎了。
    蒋介石撒起谎来，大都是空空洞洞的，例如“还政于民”“我历来要和平”之类，不让人家在他的话里捉住什么具体的事物。李宗仁在这件事上显得蹩脚，容易给人家抓住小辫子。例如，在他那个“致电毛泽东”里面说：“现政府方面，已从言论与行动上表明和平之诚意。所有以往全国各方人民所要求者，如释放政治犯，开放言论，保障人民自由等，在逐步实施。事实俱在，何得谓虚？”人们说：“事实毫无，何得谓实？”李宗仁说：“事实俱在，何得谓虚？”李宗仁就是具有这样一种傻劲的人物。
    但是李宗仁也有胜过蒋介石的地方。在应否惩办战争罪犯这个问题上，蒋介石及其死党从来不说可以惩办的话。他们或者不说话，例如在一月二十一日蒋介石的“引退文告”里对于中共的八条一字不提；或者表示反对态度，例如雷震、朱家骅、潘公展等人所发表的言论。根本反对将战犯当作问题来讨论。孙科也近似这些人，他说和谈条件必须“公平合理”，意思就是反对惩办战犯。李宗仁不是这样，他是又赞成，又反对，这就是李宗仁别致的地方。
    李宗仁在其一月二十二日的声明里说：“中共方面所提八条件，政府即愿开始商谈。”这即是说，李宗仁的政府愿意即刻开始商谈中共方面所提的惩办战争罪犯一项条件以及其他七项条件，他首先给你一点甜的东西吃。过了六天，李宗仁的腔调变了，而且变得很厉害。一九四九年一月二十七日，国民党反动卖国政府的代总统，在其“致电毛泽东”里面说：“贵方所提八项条件，政府方面已承认可以此作为基础进行和谈，各项问题自均可在谈判中商讨决定。在双方商谈尚未开始以前，即要求对方必须先执行某项条件，则何得谓之为和谈？以往恩怨是非倘加过分重视，则仇仇相报宁有已时，哀吾同胞，恐无噍类，先生与弟将同为民族千古之罪人矣。”哎哟哟，李宗仁来得厉害，这一枪非同小可。但是李宗仁的枪法，仍然不过是小诸葛桂系教程里的东西，中国自有孙子兵法足以破之。夫“在双方尚未开始商谈以前，即要求对方必须先执行某项条件”者，是因为南京国民党反动卖国政府自其兵败如山倒以后，即如丧考妣地要求谈判。中共说，好，待我们准备好了你们即来谈。战犯们说，不行，非立刻开谈不可。中共说，你们闲得发慌，给你们一件工作做罢，你们去逮捕一批（自然不是全部）战犯。故事的过程就是这样。后来，中共又将逮捕改为监视，算是作了一个极大的让步，战犯们才安静下来，不再吵闹了。这是后话，不提。且说一月二十七日，李宗仁又说，恩怨是非不要过分重视，即是说不要分清战争责任，不要惩办战争罪犯。那怕黄河以南直至长江，黄河以北直至松花江，发生了“惨绝人寰的浩劫”（谨按，此语见之于李代总统一九四九年一月二十二日的文告），那也算不了什么。如果你们一定要惩办战犯，则战犯们的拥护者会要报复的。这种报复，可能达到可怕的程度，即全国同胞中没有一个能吃东西的了，都死完了。如此，你毛泽东和我李宗仁两个，将要被我们民族（谨按，既然都死完了，为什么还有民族，待考）判决为在一千年那么长久时期内的犯罪者。还好，只有一千年受罪，一千零一年又是一条好汉，这算是李代总统的恩典。
    人们请看，李宗仁就是这样反复无常的，又赞成商谈惩办战犯，又不赞成实行惩办战犯，他的脚踏在两条船上，这就是他和蒋介石不同的地方。
