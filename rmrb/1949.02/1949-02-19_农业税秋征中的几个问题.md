　　Several Problems in the Autumn Collection of Agricultural Tax
　　Hao Jimin, Kang Liren, Huang Zichun
　　The allocation of agricultural tax to various administrative regions in the North China Liberated Area for the fiscal year of 1949 was based on the newly promulgated agricultural tax regulations and the reports from various regions regarding new and old areas, population, land yield, and harvest conditions, taking into account the foundation of work, disaster relief and exemptions. The total grain burden for the entire region for the year was calculated based on the burden-bearing population and the reported land yield of each region (the yield was revised after research based on the conditions of each region). The total average burden per person in the region is approximately 70 jin of millet. Because the average standard mu per person varies from region to region, the average burden per person also varies. The administrative region with the highest burden has a total average of 78 jin per person (more land, higher yield), while the lowest has a total average of 56 jin per person (less land, lower yield). Calculated by burden-bearing mu, the average burden per mu in the region is 23.7 jin of millet. The administrative region with the highest burden does not exceed 25 jin per mu (regions with good harvests), and the lowest is 22.92 jin. The total burden for the region accounts for 18.23% of the normal agricultural yield, with the highest being 19.4% and the lowest being 17.3%. Furthermore, according to the autumn collection allocation reports of several administrative regions: the average burden per mu in the entire Jizhong region is 23.58 jin, with the average burden in the prefecture with the highest burden being 23.8 jin, and the lowest being 22.35 jin. The average burden per mu in the entire Jinan region is 18.14 jin, with the average burden in the prefecture with the highest burden being 18.88 jin, and the lowest being 17.14 jin. The average burden per mu in the entire Jiluyu region is 15.98 jin, with the highest burden in the prefecture being 21.17 jin, and the lowest being 13.43 jin. This shows that the collection of agricultural tax in the North China region and various administrative regions this year is calculated and allocated according to the principle that the agricultural tax does not exceed 20% of the total agricultural income. However, if local grain is added (an additional 2.5 to 5 jin per burden-bearing mu), the burden generally exceeds 20%.
　　This year's autumn collection, encouraged by the victorious revolutionary situation, has seen generally enthusiastic grain payment from the masses, and cadres at all levels have generally worked hard. Many regions, such as Beiyue, Taiyue, and most of Jiluyu, have completed the task well. Jinzhong, despite the busy support for the front lines, was still able to grasp the collection tightly. Jizhong, due to the clear leadership ideology and sufficient preparation work (such as organized surveys of harvest conditions and fairer allocation), completed the task even more smoothly. The implementation of the new tax regulations will also greatly stimulate production. First, it gives farmers "a clear idea," "who pays how much is clear and definite." They believe that the new method is not only simple and easy to implement, even wives and children can calculate it, but also fair and reasonable. Cultivating the land, selecting seeds, and intensive farming mean "more harvest doesn't mean more tax"; for idlers and lazy people, "less harvest doesn't mean less tax." As a result, many farmers are actively preparing for spring plowing. For example, Tian Congfu, the industrial committee member of Hai Village in Hunyuan, Beiyue, added livestock, accumulated fertilizer, bought grass, and prepared for intensive farming, and the number of people picking up manure suddenly increased. However, in some areas, cadres and the masses are complaining about the heavy burden and cannot understand the idea. Some cadres even resist the task allocation, and individual masses have petitioned the government or sold their production tools. Why is this happening? According to research in various places, the main problems are as follows:
　　(1) The imbalance and unfairness in the determination of land yield, and the untruthfulness in the registration of land acreage, are the main reasons. For example, a survey of four households in Houweitan, Weixian, Jinan, showed that the registered yield only reached 39.5% of the normal yield, and this year's burden only accounted for 7.2% of the actual agricultural income. Nancun and Beicun in Yangcheng, Taiyue, are adjacent to each other and have the same land quality, but the average yield per mu in Nancun is 1.02 shi, while the average yield per mu in Beicun is 1.74 shi. If the burden of public grain is 25 jin per standard mu according to the determined yield, the former bears an average of 25.5 jin of public grain per mu, while the latter bears 43.5 jin. Due to the high or low yield, the latter bears 18 jin more per mu than the former, which is 70.6%. The phenomenon of extremely heavy or light burden caused by the imbalance of yield assessment is quite common in the North China region. In addition, some cadres and the masses engage in localism, concealing production and land, reducing the burden, and transferring the burden to others, making the imbalance even greater.
　　(2) The untruthfulness of the survey of harvest conditions and disasters. For example, the fourth and fifth prefectures of Beiyue are almost the same in terms of wealth. When the administrative office allocated tasks, it allocated 4.027 shi dou per person to take care of the disaster situation in the fourth prefecture, and 4.339 shi dou per person to the fifth prefecture. However, the actual burden per person in some areas of the fourth prefecture was still very heavy. For example, in Pingshan County, Beiyue Region, the dry land had a poor harvest due to lack of rain this year, which was different from the harvest of the water land. Comparing the three villages of Zhanghuzhuang, Xihuishe, and Xigangshang in the second district of the county: dry land accounted for 80% of the total cultivated land in Zhanghuzhuang (the rest is water land, and the burden-bearing mu of both water and dry land is based on the determined yield); dry land accounted for 47% in Xihuishe; and dry land accounted for 28% in Xigangshang. According to the survey, the harvests of these three villages are about: 45% in Zhanghuzhuang, 60% in Xihuishe, and 70% in Xigangshang. In the allocation of burden, the three villages were all 24.5 jin per burden-bearing mu. The reduction of disaster figures was basically egalitarian. Zhanghuzhuang reduced 732 jin, accounting for 2.2% of the total burden; Xihuishe reduced 1,347 jin, accounting for slightly more than 0.5% of the total; and Xigangshang reduced 453 jin, accounting for 2.3% of the total burden. If a good survey of harvest conditions is not conducted before the collection, and the disaster areas cannot be well taken care of, the burden in the disaster areas will appear heavy. This is a lesson we should learn.
　　(3) The poor military, industrial, and martyr family members and orphans who lack labor, because they lack labor, manure, and hire people or substitute farming, their actual yield is generally lower than the normal yield. For example, a section member of the Xiyang County government cultivated more than 20 mu of land, assessed a yield of more than 20 shi, but actually harvested less than 7 shi, which is equal to about 23% of the assessed yield. Of course, the burden is very heavy in this way. For example, Sun Kang, an orphan in Tiandu Village, District 1, Pingshan, bears 76% of the actual income. According to reactions from various places, their burden generally accounts for about 50% of the actual income, which should also be paid great attention to.
　　(4) The new tax regulations were released late, and the publicity and explanation work was poor. Some people did not know what the new tax regulations were, and some village cadres did not understand them, so they still burdened them according to the old fractions or land mu, which aggravated the imbalance of the burden.
　　(5) Local grain and public grain are collected at the same time, and loan collection and public grain collection are mixed together. For example, Jinan and Taihang reflect that when the public grain is being collected, the past loans are also being collected, squeezing the people to pay the public grain and also return the loan grain. Taking too much grain makes the people feel the burden is heavy.
　　Due to the above reasons, the burden is extremely unbalanced. In order to prevent these problems from happening again in the future, the following suggestions are put forward for reference:
　　(1) It is necessary to widely publicize the main reason for the imbalance of the burden: the land yield is not truthfully determined and is unbalanced, and the land acreage is not accurate enough, so that the masses thoroughly realize that: "If you want to make the burden fair and reasonable and fixed, you can only determine the land yield and land mu truthfully." The North China People's Government has decided to make this work the central task of governments at all levels from February to March this year. The implementation of this work: (1) First of all, cadres must clearly recognize the importance of this work ideologically, and lead the masses to carry out the yield assessment movement in an organized and planned manner to achieve true and balanced yields and eliminate black land. (2) There must be sufficient preparation and careful planning, organize all possible forces to closely combine with other work, and even organize all forces to participate in this work for a certain period of time, and analyze and study the basic figures such as population, land, yield, and dry land and slope land yields, crop distribution, production conditions, and average figures per person, Find out different economic types, and then analyze and study the average land per person, the average yield per mu (separately for water and dry land), and the average yield per person to help divide them into different wealth levels; in particular, focus on mastering the comparison and research of the yields of the combined parts of the special, county, district, and village. (3) It is more important to do a good job in mobilization and education, prevent the selfish localism of some people and cadres, fearing that their village will increase the burden, concealing land and production. This work is a complex and meticulous mass work. If insufficient attention is paid to this point, it will be difficult to achieve true balance in land mu and yield.
　　If the land yield of our entire region reaches true balance, the burden of farmers (outside of land grain and money) can also be fixed under the principle that it does not exceed 20% of the total agricultural income. Only in this way can we stabilize the production enthusiasm of farmers, more powerfully support the national liberation war, and carry out various new democratic constructions.
　　(2) It is impossible to reduce the burden on the people under the current national-scale liberation war and various necessary constructions. We can only practice thrift and, more importantly, carry out a large-scale production movement to increase the wealth of the people and relatively reduce the burden on the people. For example, the masses in Renzhuang, Licheng, Taihang, organized transportation and planned to earn back the public grain for the entire village. This is a good example.
　　(3) We must conscientiously act according to the tax regulations: The new agricultural tax regulations are formulated according to the new rural economic situation after the land reform. It was formulated after many studies and experiments. All localities must implement according to the tax regulations and should not change the tax regulations. Even if there are places in the tax regulations that need to be studied, specific materials should be submitted for leadership consideration, and do not tamper with them without authorization, which will affect the overall situation.
　　The several issues and opinions discussed above are for reference only due to the lack of materials (some may be one-sided).

　　农业税秋征中的几个问题
    郝济民、康立人、黄子纯
    一九四九年度（按财政年度计算）华北解放区向各行署区分配农业税，是根据新颁布的农业税则及各区报告的新老区、人口、土地产量、年景收成加以研究，并照顾工作基础、灾情减免而分配的。全区全年公粮总负担，按负担人口及各区报告的土地产量（产量曾按各区情况研究改正过）计算，全区每人总平均负担约为小米七十斤强，因各区每人平均标准亩有多有少，每人平均负担数也就有了差别。负担最多的行署，每人总平均七十八斤（土地多、产量大）。最低的每人总平均五十六斤（土地少、产量小），按负担亩计算，全区每亩平均负担小米为二十三点七斤，负担最多的行署，每亩平均负担也不超过二十五斤（年景好的地区），最低为二十二点九二斤。全区总负担，占农业常年应产量百分之十八点二三，其中最高者为百分之十九点四，最低者为百分之十七点三。再根据几个行署的秋征分配报告：冀中全区平均每负担亩二十三点五八斤，负担最多的专区平均二十三点八斤，低者二十二点三五斤。冀南全区平均每负担亩十八点一四斤，负担很多的专区平均十八点八八斤，低者为十七点一四斤。冀鲁豫全区平均每负担亩十五点九八斤，负担最多的专区为二十一点一七斤，低者为十三点四三斤。这就说明今年华北区与各行署区在农业税征收上，是按照农业税不超过农业总收入百分之二十的原则计算与分配的，但如加上地方粮（每负担亩附征二斤半到五斤），则负担一般超过了百分之二十。
    今年的秋征在革命胜利形势的鼓舞下，群众缴纳公粮一般是踊跃的，各级干部一般都很努力，许多地区如北岳、太岳、冀鲁豫的大部都完成的很好；晋中在支援前线繁忙下，仍能抓紧征收而冀中由于领导思想的明确，和准备工作的充分（如有组织地勘察年景，分配较公平），完成的更顺利。薪税则的实施，对生产也将起很大的刺激作用。首先使农民“心里有了底”，“谁出多少有根有把”。认为新办法不但简单易行，老婆孩子能算，并且公平合理，修地选种，精耕细作，“多打了也不多拿”；二流子懒汉，“打少了也不少拿”。因而许多农民都积极准备春耕，如北岳浑源海村添购牲口，积肥买草，准备精耕细作，拾粪的骤然增加，实业委员田从富半夜就起来拾粪去。但也有些地区干部和群众对今年负担喊重，思想上搞不通，有的干部对任务分配甚至发生抵抗思想，个别群众亦有向政府请愿或出卖生产工具的。为什么会发生这样现象呢？根据各地研究，主要有以下几个问题：
    （一）土地产量订定的不平衡，不公道，和土地亩数登记的不真实，这是主要原因。如冀南威县后魏滩的四户调查，登记产量仅达常年应产量的百分之三九点五，今年负担只占农业实收入百分之七点二。太岳阳城南留村与北留村相毗连，土地质量相同，而南留村每亩平均订产一点零二石，北留村每亩平均订产量则为一点七四石，若按所订产量每标准亩负担公粮二十五斤，前者每亩平均负担公粮二十五斤半，后者每亩平均负担四十三斤半。同样土质的土地，就因订产的高低，后者比前者每亩要多负担十八斤，即百分之七十点六。又中庄与永善两村土质相近，中庄订产比永善高百分之八十八点四。太行左权（即辽县）寒王镇与和顺窑底村，也是相近的村庄，同样的土地。寒王镇平均每亩订产五斗，窑底村平均每亩订产三斗。若按每标准亩负担公粮二十五斤计算，则寒王镇比窑底村平均每亩多负担百分之六十六点六。因评产不平衡而造成负担上的畸重畸轻现象，在华北区是相当多的。再加上某些干部和群众闹本位，瞒产瞒地，缩小负担面，将负担嫁于别人，不平衡的现象就更多了。
    （二）年景灾情调查的不真实。如北岳四、五专署，在富力上差不多，行署在分配任务时，为照顾四专区灾情，分配每人四点零二七市斗，五专区分配每人四点三三九市斗。但五专区具体分配到区，每人实际负担只四点零三市斗。而四专区有的地方仍出的很重。又如在北岳区之平山县，今年旱地因缺雨歉收，和水地收成相较有所差别。以该县二区之张胡庄、西回舍、西岗上三村比较来看：张胡庄旱地占全部耕地百分之八十；（其他为水地，水旱地均以其所订产量之负担亩为标准，下同。）西回舍旱地占百分之四十七；西岗上旱地占百分之二十八。根据调查，这三村的收成约为：张胡庄四成半，西回舍六成，西岗上七成。在负担的分配上，三村均为每负担亩二十四斤半。对于灾情数字之减免基本上是平均主义的，张胡庄减去七百三十二斤，占全部负担百分之二点二；西回舍减一千三百四十七斤，占全部百分之零点五强；西岗上减四百五十三斤，占全部负担百分之二点三。在征收前如对年景不作很好调查，不能很好照顾灾区，就会使灾区负担显得重。这是我们应该接受的经验教训。
    （三）贫苦无劳力之军、工、烈属及生活困难的孤寡户，因他们缺乏劳力粪草，雇人或代耕经营较差，实产量一般低于常年应产量。如昔阳县政府一个科员，种土地二十余亩，评产二十余石，实收不足七石，等于评定产量的百分之二三强。这样在负担上当然就显得很重。又如平山一区田都村孤寡户孙康氏，负担占实收入百分之七十六。据各地反应，一般他们负担要占实收入的五十上下，这也应该引起极大注意的。
    （四）新税则发布的迟，宣传解释工作做的差，有些地区群众还不知道新税则是什么，有些村干部也未弄通，仍然按旧分数或地亩负担，因而加重了负担的不平衡。
    （五）地方粮和公粮同时征收，收贷款和征公粮混在一起。如冀南、太行反映正征公粮时候，过去的贷款也在收，挤的群众出了公粮还要交还贷款粮，拿粮太多，因此群众就感觉负担重。
    由于以上这些原因，造成负担上极不平衡，为使这些问题今后再不致发生，谨提出以下几点意见，供各地参考：
    （一）应广泛宣传造成负担不平衡的主要原因：是土地产量订的不真实，不平衡，土地亩数不够确实，使群众彻底认识到：“要想使负担公平公理，固定起来，只有把土地产量和地亩订定真实。华北人民政府已决定把这一工作，作为今年二至三月份各级政府的中心工作。对这一工作的进行：（一）首先干部思想上必须明确认识这一工作的重要性，有组织、有计划地去领导群众开展评产运动，做到产量真实平衡，黑地消灭。（二）必须有充分的准备和周密的计划，组织所有一切可能利用的力量，做到和其它工作的密切接合，甚至以一定时间，组织一切力量参加这一工作，将人口、土地、产量等基本数字，和水旱、坡地各种土地产量，农作物分布，出产情况，以及每人平均数字等，加以分析研究，找出不同的经济类型，再把每人平均土地，每亩（分别水旱）平均产量、与每人平均产量，加以分析研究帮分成不同的富力等级；特别要着重掌握专、县、区、村间的结合部产量的比较和研究。（三）更要作好动员教育工作，防止某些群众和干部的自私本位思想，怕自己村负担加重，瞒地瞒产，这一工作是复杂细致的群众工作，必须发动起群众，走群众路线，才能做好，如果在这一点上注意的不够，则地亩产量就很难做到真实平衡。
    如果我们全区土地产量达到真实平衡，农民的负担（地粮款外）也就可以在不超过农业总收入百分之二十的原则之下固定起来，如此才能稳定农民生产情绪，更有力的支援全国解放战争，以及进行新民主主义各种建设。
    （二）在目前全国规模的解放战争和各种必要建设的情况下，减轻人民负担是不可能的。我们只有励行节约，更重要的是开展大规模生产运动，增加人民的财富，相对的来减轻人民的负担。如太行黎城任庄群众组织运输，计划赚回全村公粮，这是好的榜样。
    （三）必须切切实实地照税则办事：新的农业税则是根据土地改革后，新的农村经济情况制定的。它是经过许多次研究与实验制定出来的。各地必须按照税则执行，不应更改税则。即使税则有须研究的地方，也应提出具体材料，提供领导考虑，不要私自篡改，致影响全面。
    以上所谈的几个问题和意见，因了解材料不多（有些可能片面），供作参考。
