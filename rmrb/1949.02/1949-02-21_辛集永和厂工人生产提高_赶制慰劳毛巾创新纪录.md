[Jizhong Electric] Since receiving an urgent task from the North China government on January 22nd to weave towels for comforting the People's Liberation Army, all employees of the Yonghe Towel Factory in Xinji City, under the leadership of the trade union and the influence of Party members and Youth League members, have achieved an unprecedented level of production. The factory was assigned 2,400 dozens of towels, and by February 11th, in just eight days, 1,200 dozens had been completed. Before accepting the task, the factory had already scheduled a ten-day holiday for the New Year, so some workers wanted to go home. After mobilization and discussion by the Party branch members' meeting and the Youth League meeting, the workers unanimously and enthusiastically responded to the call and accepted the task. In order to quickly convert the thirty weaving machines from coarse thread to fine thread, the factory management committee first made precise plans and appropriately adjusted raw materials, technology, labor, and tools. The original plan was to convert all thirty machines to fine thread by February 13th. Through the efforts of the bleaching and winding groups, the towel weaving workers did not stop working during the conversion period, and all thirty machines were completed ahead of schedule by seven days, starting from the 4th, according to the predetermined plan. During the crash production mission, Party members and Youth League members played a driving role. Zhao Qiufu, the winding group leader, led three apprentices in winding. Zuo Yingzheng, a skilled towel weaver, was suffering from eye problems, and his face was swollen from toothache, but he still insisted on working while wearing glasses. Zhen Zhuang, Zhai Jingang, and Zhao Zhenfu all persevered in the crash production mission despite being ill. Zhen Zhuang said, "I am a Party member, and I must be at the forefront of work and strive to be a production model. Sickness is a minor matter; as long as I can move, I must work." Under the leading influence of Party members and Youth League members, a vigorous production competition was launched throughout the factory, and output increased daily. In January, the factory's maximum daily output was 70 dozens of towels, but by the 19th, it had increased to a maximum record of 110 to 120 dozens, exceeding the usual output by nearly double. The apprentices in the winding group averaged a maximum of one and a half per person per day in January, but during the crash mission in February, some increased to two to three per day. All employees of the factory are currently working intensely.

　　辛集永和厂工人生产提高
  　赶制慰劳毛巾创新纪录
    【冀中电】辛集市永和毛巾工厂，自上月二十二日接到华北政府订织毛巾慰劳解放军的紧急任务后，全体职工，在职工会的领导和党员青年团员的带头影响下，生产量达到空前的纪录。全厂分配任务二千四百打，截至本月十一号八天时间，已完成一千二百打。接受任务前，工厂已确定过年放假十天，所以个别工人想回家，经过支部党员大会和青年团大会动员，酝酿讨论工人们一致热烈的响应了这一号召，接受任务。为了使三十张织土线毛巾的机子很快改变为细线，工厂管理委员会首先作了精密计划，适当调整了原料、技术、劳动和工具。原计划争取在二月十三号三十张机子全部改换细线，经过漂线组和轮线组的努力，在倒换期间，织毛巾工人也没有停工，三十张机子从四号起按预定计划提前七天就全部完成了。在突击生产任务中，党员和青年团员，起了推动作用。轮线组长赵秋福带领着三个学员轮线。织毛巾技术工人左英正正害眼病，牙痛的脸都肿了，还戴着镜子坚持工作。振庄、翟进岗、赵振福，都是带病坚持突击生产任务。振庄说：“我是个党员，工作要干在头里，争取生产模范，病是小事，只要能动就得工作。”在党员和青年团员的带头影响下，全厂掀起了轰轰烈烈的生产竞赛，产量逐日提高，一月份每日全厂最多产毛巾七十打，到十九号就增到一百一十打到一百二十打的最高纪录，超过平时产量将近一倍。轮线组的学员在一月份最多者每人每日平均一个半，而在二月后突击任务中有的每日增到两个至三个。全厂全体职工现正紧张的工作中。
