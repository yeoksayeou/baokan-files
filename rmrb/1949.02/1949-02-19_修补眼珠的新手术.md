　　New Surgery to Repair Eyeballs
　　Last time, we introduced the longevity drug invented by Soviet scientists. Today, let's talk about another Soviet scientific invention—a new surgery to repair eyeballs.
　　It was also shortly before the Soviet-German war during World War II that Soviet ophthalmologist Filatov invented a new surgery. He can remove the cornea from eyeballs that are too severely injured to be saved and use them to repair the corneas of others. This enables people who have lost their sight due to damaged corneas to regain their vision. During the process of his invention, initially, the small piece of cornea that was grafted in was somewhat antagonistic to the surrounding parts and could not immediately grow together. Later, he invented the application of corneas from the deceased, which achieved very good results. After grafting this cornea, it not only does not antagonize the surrounding parts, but it can also grow together very well. If the surrounding cornea has some disease and appears opaque, it can become clear after surgery.
　　Regarding the use of corneas from the deceased, the deceased must not have died from infectious diseases. The cornea of his eye is removed and stored in the refrigerator, and it can be taken out at any time when needed.
　　The Soviet Union used this new invention to treat many blind officers and soldiers during the war. Filatov's invention is not only a creation in the treatment of ophthalmological diseases, but also a great contribution to the entire field of medicine. That is, applying a part of the deceased's body (not necessarily the cornea) after being stored in the refrigerator for a few days and then applying it to a living person has a great stimulating effect and can cure many diseases. In the Soviet Union, it has been used to treat ten very different diseases, and the results have been very good.

### 修补眼珠的新手术

　　修补眼珠的新手术
    前次，我们曾经介绍过苏联科学家发明的长寿药，今天我们再谈一件苏联科学上的发明——修补眼珠的新手术。
    也是在第二次世界大战中，苏联对德战争以前不久，苏联眼科专家费拉托夫，发明了一种新的手术，他能将眼睛受伤太重，没法挽救了的眼珠上的角膜取下来，给角膜坏了的人修补。使那些坏了角膜瞎了眼的人，重见光明，在他这个发明的过程中：最初，修补进去的那小点角膜，和周围的部分还有些对抗，不能马上长到一起，后来他又发明应用死人的角膜，得到很好的效果。将这角膜修补上去后，和周围的部分不但不对抗，而且可以很好的长到一起。如果周围的角膜有些病，显得不透明，施用手术后，还可以清明起来。
    关于应用死人的角膜，必须是死人不是因传染病死的。把他眼睛的角膜取下，藏在冰箱里，要用时随时可以取出。
    苏联应用这个新发明，在战争中间医治好了很多瞎眼的官兵。费拉托夫的这个发明，不仅在眼科病治法上有了创造，而且对整个医学上也有很大的贡献。那就是应用死人身上的一部分（不一定是角膜）在冰箱保存几天后，再用到活人身上，还有很大的刺激作用，能治好许多病。在苏联曾经用来治过十种很不相同的疾病，效果都很好。
