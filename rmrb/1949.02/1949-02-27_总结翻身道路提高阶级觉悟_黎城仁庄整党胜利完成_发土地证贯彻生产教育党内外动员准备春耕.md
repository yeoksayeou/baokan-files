[Taixing Telegraph] The village of Renzhuang in Licheng County has successfully completed its Party rectification work by combining it with the inspection and conclusion of land reform, resolving outstanding issues, and issuing land certificates. In the education summarizing the conclusion of land reform, the village used individual talks, small-scale seminars, and mass meetings to, on the one hand, affirm the achievements of land reform over the years and conduct unity and production education; on the other hand, it launched a mass discussion on the conclusion of land reform and the resolution of outstanding issues in the village. Based on the actual situation, the Party members were asked to examine "what deviations from the Party's policies existed" and "what outstanding issues had not been resolved or were improperly resolved." In this way, thirteen outstanding issues were further identified.

Because land certificates had not been issued, some people did not dare to boldly engage in production; some people, because their lives had greatly improved after land reform, developed the idea that "the revolution has succeeded," were content with the status quo, and did not want to further organize to develop production. Therefore, while resolving outstanding issues and preparing to issue land certificates, the village also resolved the ideological problems of the masses, implemented timely production and current affairs education, and enhanced class consciousness and the consciousness of organizing to produce and become prosperous, making preparations for spring plowing.

On the basis of the initial improvement of the masses' thinking, they were further guided to recall the path to liberation and the achievements of organizing production and mutual assistance through their own experiences. After discussion, the masses became clearer about the principle that "to become prosperous, we must organize." The three carts that had not been organized also participated in mutual aid transportation. At the same time, propaganda was carried out on the Party's internal and external Party rectification policies, clarifying the inseparable relationship between the Party and the masses, in order to inspire the masses and Party members to be conscious of Party rectification. After the Party members reviewed the past work of the branch and themselves, they not only reviewed the achievements and shortcomings, but also realized the seriousness of their own mistakes (especially the bad style of being divorced from the masses), which had harmed both the Party and themselves, thereby enhancing the Party members' determination and courage to recognize and correct their mistakes. In order to better master the weapon of criticism and self-criticism, they also studied documents such as the Party Program, the Party Constitution, and branch teaching materials, further understood the rights and obligations of Party members and the policies, methods, and steps of Party rectification, and established the correct attitude of Party members in Party rectification.

On the basis of relatively mature deliberation within and outside the Party, the branch was publicly rectified. Twenty-three representatives were elected by the masses to collect opinions from the masses to help with Party rectification. Criticism and self-criticism were carried out within the branch, pointing out the harmfulness of mistakes. Through analysis and criticism, all Party members were able to deeply realize what their main mistakes were, and the ideological level of Party members was improved. In the process of Party rectification within the Party and with the participation and assistance of mass representatives, the following experiences were obtained: (1) After personal review, the mass representatives should first fully explain the opinions of the masses, and then the Party members and representatives should jointly analyze and discuss according to the spirit of "starting from reality, dealing with the matter at hand, distinguishing between good and bad, right and wrong, and being public-minded," and the Party members being criticized should defend themselves on the spot to directly obtain correct conclusions. If the representatives simply put forward opinions and the Party members do not participate in the discussion, the representatives will feel that "we have reflected the opinions of the masses and that's it!" It is not easy to receive a certain effect. (2) When dividing into groups for Party rectification, special attention should be paid to appropriately separating the backbone members and active members among the Party members, and ensuring the development of the criticism movement. (3) Specifically solve outstanding issues (such as corruption and land reform). Only in this way can Party members gradually reduce their ideological burden, criticism can be deepened, and the masses will be satisfied. (4) Pay attention to the ideological development and changes of Party members and provide specific assistance. (5) The attitude of Party members and representatives towards Party rectification should be checked at any time, and various concerns should be resolved in a timely manner to ensure the implementation of the Party rectification policy. Finally, the branch examined the past leadership, democratically reorganized the group, elected a new branch, conducted Party rectification review and summary, and carried out Party Constitution, Party Program education and policy education, improved the Party's various systems, consolidated the results of Party rectification, and put forward questions such as "what should Party members do after Party rectification" and "how to lead the masses forward" to start discussions, clarify the leading role of the Party.

　　总结翻身道路提高阶级觉悟
  　黎城仁庄整党胜利完成
    发土地证贯彻生产教育党内外动员准备春耕
    【太行电】黎城仁庄村结合检查结束土地改革、解决遗留问题及颁发土地证，胜利完成了整党工作。该村在总结结束土地改革的教育中，利用个别谈话、小型座谈及群众大会等方式，一面肯定数年来土地改革成绩进行团结生产教育；一面开展群众对本村结束土地改革及解决遗留问题的酝酿，并根据实际情况在党内检查“有哪些不合党的政策的偏向”，“有哪些没有解决或解决不妥当的遗留问题”，这样，继续查出遗留问题十三件。由于未发土地证，部分群众不敢大胆生产；也有些人因为土地改革后生活大大改善而产生“革命成功”的思想，满足现状，不要求进一步组织起来发展生产。因此，便在解决遗留问题准备发土地证的情况下，同时解决群众思想问题，贯彻生产及时事教育，提高阶级觉悟与组织起来生产发家的自觉性，给春耕作了准备。在群众思想初步提高的基础上，进而诱导其以自身经历体会，回忆翻身道路和组织生产互助的成绩，经过讨论群众更明确了“要想发家致富，必须组织起来”的道理，未组织起来的三辆大车也参加了互助运输。同时，并进行党内外整党政策的宣传，明确党群血肉不可分的关系，以启发群众及党员对整党的自觉，经过党员回顾支部与自身以往的工作，一方面检讨了成绩与缺点；同时也认识到自身错误（特别是脱离群众的恶劣作风），使党与自己都遭受损害的严重性，从而提高党员认识错误与改正错误的决心和勇气。为了更好的掌握批评与自我批评的武器，又学习了党纲、党章及支部教材等文件，进一步认识党员权利义务及整党政策、方法、步骤，树立了党员在整党中的正确态度。
    在党内外酝酿比较成熟的基础上，即公开支部进行整党。由群众选出二十三个代表收集群众意见帮助整党，在支部内开展批评与自我批评，指出错误的危害性，经过分析批判，使党员都能够深刻地认识到自己主要的错误是什么，提高了党员的思想水平。在党内开展批评与群众代表参加帮助的整党过程中得出了以下几点经验：（一）个人检讨后，首先让群众代表充分说明群众意见，接着由党员与代表根据“从实际出发，就事论事，分清好坏是非为公为私”的精神，共同分析讨论，并让被批评的党员当场申辩，直接获得正确的结论。如单纯代表提意见，党员不参加讨论，代表便会感到“咱给群众反映了意见就算啦！”不易收到一定的效果。（二）在划分小组整党时，特别注意党员中的骨干分子与积极分子的适当分开，且保证批评运动的展开。（三）具体解决遗留问题（如贪污及土地改革遗留问题）。这样才能使党员逐渐减少思想负担，使批评引向深入，而群众也会感到满意。（四）注意党员思想的发展变化，具体加以帮助。（五）应随时检查党员及代表的整党态度，及时解除各种顾虑，以保证整党政策的贯彻。最后，支部即检查过去领导，民主整顿小组，选出新的支部，进行整党检讨与总结及党章、党纲教育与政策教育，健全党的各种制度，使整党的成果更加巩固，并提出：“整党后党员应做些什么”，“如何领导群众前进”等问题，展开讨论，使党员明确党的领导作用。
