　　To the Editor Concerning Veterans Performing Labor Service:
　　In our district, many veterans are discharged and return home due to hemoptysis. The villagers say they can endure hardship and should perform labor service. However, the veterans believe they are honorable and refuse to serve, or serve very little. The villagers sometimes say, "If you don't serve, I won't serve either." This issue often delays the completion of tasks. Should veterans perform labor service? Hoping for a reply.

    Answer: Veterans returning home should, like other villagers, fulfill their obligation to perform labor service. If they are indeed physically weak or unable to move freely due to illness, they may apply, and with the approval of the villagers' assembly and the district government, a portion or all of the service may be reduced or waived. If they consider themselves special and refuse to perform labor service, they should be educated to correct their behavior.

专栏：询问与答复

　　退伍军人应服勤务编辑同志：
    我区退伍军人，多因吐血退伍回家，村里群众说他们能受苦，就能服勤务。但退伍军人，以为自己光荣，硬不服，或很少服。群众有时因此都说，你不服，我也不服。对这问题，常拖延完成任务的时间。究竟退伍军人应否服勤务？希复。
  　　　　　　　　　　　定襄四区公所梁玉公
    答：退伍军人回家，应和村民同样尽服勤的义务。如确因身体病弱行动不便者，可由本人申请，村民大会通过，区政府批准，方可减免一部或全部；如认为自己特殊，硬不服勤务，应多加教育，使其改正。
