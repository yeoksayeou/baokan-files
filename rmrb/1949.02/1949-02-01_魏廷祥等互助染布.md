　　Wei Tingxiang and Others Cooperatively Dye Cloth
　　[Taihang News] Wei Tingxiang, Wang Jikui, and four other villagers from Xia Village, Ninth District, Wu'an, cooperatively opened a dye house to engage in winter sideline production. Among the six, only Wei Tingxiang knew how to dye cloth; the other five did not. After discussion, they decided to help each other: Wei would stay home to help two others learn dyeing, while the remaining three would go out to solicit cloth. After the autumn harvest and wheat planting, each person contributed three to four hundred yuan (converted to new currency), raising a total of two thousand yuan, and they started working. They used soda ash and black leaves as dyes, and the dyed cloth was of good quality. In half a month, they spent a total of one hundred and fifty workdays and earned one thousand five hundred yuan in silver dollars. Each workday was allocated sixteen yuan and six jiao. However, they distributed the profits per capita, without considering the value of the work done. Those who had worked more were dissatisfied. After rectification, they established the principles of democratic equivalence and mutual benefit for labor and capital, elected a team leader, established a work point ledger, consolidated the mutual aid team, and everyone's enthusiasm for production was reignited.

　　魏廷祥等互助染布
    【太行讯】武安九区夏庄村民魏廷祥、王继魁等六人互助开染房，搞冬季副业生产。六人中只魏廷祥是开染房的，其余五人都不会染布。他们讨论决定大家互助：由魏在家帮着二人学染，其余三人出去揽布。秋收种麦后每人出资三、四百元（折新币下同）不等，共集资二千元，就干起来。染料用碱面、黑叶子，梁出的布很好。半个月中，共费一百五十个工，赚洋一千五百元。每工分红十六元六角余。但他们分红时是按人头分，不计工等价。多出了工的不满意。在互助中又没有组长。经过整顿，订出民主等价、劳资两利原则，选出组长，立了记工帐，巩固了互助组，大家生产情绪又高涨起来。
