Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 14th. Kuomintang bandit gangs have once again created a bloodbath of slaughtering the people in Kunming. According to a dispatch from the Kuomintang Central News Agency on the 12th, the Kunming Kuomintang authorities, under the pretext of "counterfeit 50-yuan denomination gold yuan notes being discovered," announced that such "gold yuan notes," regardless of whether they were genuine or counterfeit, could not be used. This immediately turned the vast number of such Kuomintang gold yuan notes held by ordinary citizens into worthless paper. This measure by the Kuomintang bandit gangs immediately caused chaos in the market. Various "gold yuan notes" were rejected by merchants, and citizens flocked to the Kuomintang pseudo-Central Bank's Kunming branch demanding exchange. Because the Kuomintang pseudo-Central Bank refused to exchange them under the excuse of "not being open on Saturday afternoons," angry masses then destroyed the pseudo-Central Bank. When the incident occurred, Lu Han, the pseudo-chairman of Yunnan Province of the Kuomintang, immediately ordered military police to surround the crowds trying to exchange money and suppressed them with gunfire, arresting fifty or sixty citizens on the spot. According to the Central News Agency, the arrested were "personally interrogated by Lu Han at the Central Bank" that same afternoon, and Lu Han ordered twenty-one of them to be immediately slaughtered in front of the pseudo-Central Bank. The number of citizens wounded by the Kuomintang military police was even greater. This is the second large-scale bloodbath of the people in Kunming under the direct command of Lu Han, the pseudo-chairman of the Kuomintang bandit gang in Yunnan, since last year. The first was the incident on July 15th last year when students at Yunnan University and Nanching Middle School in Kunming were massacred with machine guns and rifles, resulting in more than one hundred students being killed and wounded.

　　在卢匪汉直接指挥下
  　昆明又发生血案
    【新华社陕北十四日电】国民党匪帮又在昆明制造屠杀人民的血案。据国民党中央社十二日电讯透露，该日昆明国民党当局“五十元票面金圆券发现伪钞”为名宣布该种“金圆券”无分真伪均不能使用，使广大市民所持有的该种国民党金圆券立刻变为废纸。国民党匪帮此项措施立即引起市场的大混乱，各种“金圆券”皆被商人拒用，市民纷纷持“金圆券”向国民党伪中央银行昆明分行要求调换。由于国民党伪中央银行竟以“星期六下午不办公”为名拒绝兑换，愤怒的群众遂将伪中央银行捣毁。事件发生时国民党云南省伪主席卢汉即命令宪兵警察前往将挤兑群众包围，并开枪镇压，当场逮捕市民五六十人。据中央社称，被捕者当日下午即“由卢汉在中央银行亲自审讯”，其中二十一人被卢汉下令立即在伪中央银行门前加以屠杀。至于被国民党宪警打伤的市民为数更多。这是去年以来国民党匪帮在云南的伪主席卢汉的直接指挥下在昆明大规模屠杀人民的第二次血案。第一次是去年七月十五日在昆明云南大学及南菁中学以机关枪及步枪屠杀学生的事件，当时学生被打死打伤者共达一百余人。
