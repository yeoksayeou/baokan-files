　　The Winter Study Movement in Rural North China
    Bai Yufeng
    The 1948 winter study movement in rural North China was carried out in conjunction with busy tasks such as supporting the front, concluding land reform, party rectification, army expansion, and winter production. Since November of last year, winter schools in various places have opened one after another. According to some incomplete statistics, in Shen County, Anping, Renqiu, Hejian, Dacheng, and Anguo counties in central Hebei, 822 villages had established winter schools in December of last year, with more than 17,600 villagers participating in the study, including more than 5,930 women. In Anping, Renqiu, and Dacheng counties, 612 civil school teachers participated in teaching, including 75 female teachers. In January of this year, Nanfeng County in the Hebei-Shandong-Henan border region reported that 106 winter schools for men and women had been established. She County in Taihang reported that 390 winter schools had been established in 209 administrative villages throughout the county, achieving the goal of having winter schools in every village, with large villages even having two or three. The total number of participants in the county reached 19,157, including 4,046 young men and women in literacy classes. According to statistics from the Third Special District of Taihang, there were a total of 300 winter schools conducting various types of education in Licheng, and 168 winter schools of various types in Huguan.

    The development of winter schools throughout the region is uneven and not universal. Based on the schools that have already opened, there are three situations: The first is starting with improving the ideological awareness of the masses and conducting ideological education in conjunction with the central tasks. Those who have adopted this approach have generally achieved certain results. In Changzhi County, Taihang, attention was paid to solving and improving the ideological awareness of the masses during the training of voluntary teachers. Repeated discussions were held on some erroneous ideas existing in the war, production, and the conclusion of land reform and democratic party rectification, relying on their awareness to further improve the awareness of the masses. In Linghou Village, Area One of She County, the masses had concerns about getting rich. After conducting education on getting rich in the winter school, everyone automatically arranged this year's life through accounting, which promoted the village's production movement. In 25 days, the masses earned 5 million yuan from various productions and bought 12 heads of livestock. Anping and Xian villages in central Hebei improved the masses' policy understanding through education on concluding land reform and party rectification. As a result, in the work of concluding land reform, the masses automatically found a landlord who should have been confiscated according to the Land Law but had not yet been confiscated, and three wealthy middle-peasant households that had been wrongly classified as rich peasants were corrected. Furthermore, Beimanzheng Village in the county combined the issuance of land certificates with winter school education, which significantly improved the level of awareness of the masses. They consciously resolved more than 50 major and minor land issues. However, some areas still lack a clear direction for the ideological education of the masses. In Shanye Village, Licheng, Taihang, due to the unclear guiding ideology when conducting production education, not a word was mentioned about "getting organized," resulting in the masses not being enthusiastic about production. In some areas of Taihang, only empty and abstract education on "socialism" was conducted, which not only failed to improve the people's enthusiasm for daring to get rich through production but instead caused the peasants to have the illusion and concerns of "eating from the same pot" and "soon to be communist." This kind of education that goes against the wishes deserves our close attention. The second situation is that some county-level leaders do not have a sufficient understanding of the importance of running winter schools to further improve the political awareness of the masses, promote central tasks, and ensure the victorious completion of work tasks. Therefore, they separate the work of winter schools from the central tasks, thinking that running winter schools is a burden. As a result, they give up leading this work, as is the case in some places in Pingshan in the Beiyue District and Puyang, Guancheng, Fan County, and Shou Zhang counties in the Hebei-Shandong-Henan District. On the other hand, some areas have problems in combination, treating all work as central work and taking everything to the winter school for discussion, such as the finance and grain committee collecting grain and raising funds, and the civil affairs department's preferential treatment for soldiers' families, substitute farming, and women's association assigning military shoe production, etc., making the winter school very chaotic, resulting in dissatisfaction among the masses, and the winter school does not receive the due results. Therefore, we must also clearly define certain central content and try our best to systematically carry out ideological education for the masses. The third situation is that only attention is paid to the form of organizing winter schools, such as organizing winter school committees and inviting teachers, but the actual leadership of the winter school is neglected. Therefore, although school has started, it is deserted and does not play a role. There are 98 villages in She County (out of a total of 209 villages in the county) that fall into this category, and 38 of the 91 village winter schools in Lucheng County are also ineffective. Shou Zhang County in the Hebei-Shandong-Henan border region made arrangements for 40 key villages for winter schools, but only five were actually established. These materials all show that the style of formalism is still quite serious. Although the phenomenon of administrative orders, forced enrollment, and fines for non-attendance are very rare this year, and cadres have some conscious understanding of forced orders in their guiding ideology, overcoming formalism is still far from enough. At the same time, after opposing forced orders, it is also necessary to prevent another deviation. For example, although some areas in central Hebei and Beiyue paid attention to the method of running schools consciously and voluntarily through the mass line in their leadership, they neglected to lead the masses in a planned and purposeful manner to improve the awareness of the masses. For example, letting the masses find their own teachers, the winter school has no fixed curriculum, and the teachers teach whatever the masses want to hear. Some even proposed: "Whoever wants to do what in the winter school, study what..." This kind of abandonment of leadership and the formation of self-flow will not enable the winter school to achieve good results.

    Literacy education has achieved certain results in various places. For example, many young people in Caochangkou in Fuping and Donggangnan and Xizhuang in Pingshan (all belonging to the Beiyue District) automatically established literacy classes and night schools. The women's literacy class in Jicun, Jincheng, automatically goes to school every afternoon; the method is to learn as soon as you arrive, and some have learned 80 characters in 20 days. In Qianzhai Village, She County, 20 or 30 young men and women organized themselves to study elementary textbooks, write calligraphy, keep diaries, write essays, and learn to use the abacus. In Dongguanbi, Huguan, 46 young women wrote a total of 920 calligraphy exercises in 20 days. Some have changed three tracing papers, and some have changed one. The most literate can recognize 100 characters, and the least literate can recognize 15 or 16 characters, and some have learned to write letters. For example, the young woman Feng Hainian's husband is serving in the army outside, and she can write back letters from the front. This kind of cultural learning for young people has gained broad social sympathy. For example, Ma Liang, an old man in Qianzhai Village (She County), said on the street: "I have never recognized a single character in my life, and I have to ask for help if something happens. Young people go to winter school to buy pens and paper, and they are not afraid to spend money. They must learn something." Zhang Zenglai, an old man in the same village, saw that his daughter-in-law could write, so he bought her two pens and fifty sheets of paper so that his daughter-in-law could study hard.

    In summary, three experiences should be gained from last year's winter study movement: First, ideological education should be the main focus for adults and the elderly. Although farmers have some awareness at present, in general, after land reform, farmers feel that the landlord class that oppressed them has been eliminated. The Kuomintang reactionaries, who the people have hated for decades, have also been defeated. Therefore, today we must point out a clear direction to the farmers and conduct in-depth education on the future of the revolution for them, and further improve the awareness of the masses on the existing basis. At the same time, the policies and laws of the democratic government, such as the new currency, marriage, anti-superstition, and the new agricultural tax, should be explained and educated at any time. Only in this way can society be smoothly advanced. Second, cultural education should be the main focus for young men and women, especially for some young men and women who have turned over after land reform and urgently demand cultural learning. Therefore, all levels must strengthen their leadership over them, and draw experience from them to vigorously support them, and lay a solid foundation for completely eliminating illiteracy in the future. At the same time, political education among young people cannot be ignored. On the one hand, we must improve them culturally, and on the other hand, we must establish a clear direction for the future of the revolution for them ideologically. Third, oppose formalism and self-flow. Leaders at all levels must have specific organizational work, such as planned and purposeful training of voluntary teachers, first arming the minds of voluntary teachers, and then improving the awareness of the masses through their awareness, which is generally successful. Changzhi County in Taihang has gained experience, and this method should be promoted. At the same time, it proves that the method of roughly arranging a set from top to bottom, not looking at the specific situation, blindly formalistically carrying out winter study, or not adding leadership and only following the masses' school-running method is also a failure.

　　华北农村的冬学运动
    白玉峰
    一九四八年华北区农村冬学运动是在结合繁忙的支前、结束土改、整党、扩军、冬季生产……等任务中进行的。自去年十一月份起，各地冬学仍都先后开课。据一些不完全的统计：冀中深县、安平、任邱、河间、大城、安国六个县，在去年十二月份中，已有八百二十二个村庄建立了冬学，参加学习的村民已达一万七千六百多人，其中有妇女五千九百三十多人。安平、任邱、大城三县已有民校教师六百一十二人参加授课，其中有女教师七十五人。今年一月份冀鲁豫南峰县统计：建立起男女冬学一百零六处。太行涉县统计：在全县二百零九个行政村中就建立了冬学三百九十处，达到村村皆有冬学，大村还有设两三处的，全县共参加人数达一万九千一百五十七人，其中参加男女青年补习班者四千零四十六人。又据太行三专署统计：黎城进行各种教育的冬学，合计三百所，壶关各种类型冬学已有一百六十八座。
    全区冬学的发展是不平衡也不普遍的，从已开学的科学来看，有三种情况：第一种情况是从提高群众思想觉悟入手，并结合中心工作进行思想教育。采取这种作法的，大都获得了一定的成绩。太行长治县在训练义务教员中，就注意了解决与提高群众思想觉悟的问题，对于在战争，生产及结束土改、民主整党等几个问题上，所存在的一些错误思想，进行了反复的讨论，依靠他们的觉悟再进一步提高群众的觉悟。涉县一区岭后村因群众对发家有顾虑，在冬学里进行了发家教育后，大家便自动用算帐方式安排了今年的生活，推动了全村的生产运动，在二十五天内，群众从各种生产中赚洋五百万元，买了十二头牲口。冀中安平与贤村，从进行结束土改和整党的教育中提高了群众的政策认识，因而在结束土改工作中，由群众自动查出了按土地法应没收而尚未没收的地主一户，提高成份错订富裕中农为富农者三户。又该县北满正村结合发土地证，进行冬学教育，使群众觉悟程度显著提高，他们自觉的解决了大小土地问题五十余件。但有些地区对群众思想教育还缺乏明确的方针。太行黎城善业村，在进行生产教育时，由于领导思想不明确，对“组织起来”只字未提，结果群众生产不起劲。太行也有些地区只进行空洞、抽象的“社会主义”的教育，不但没有提高了人民大胆发家致富的生产热忱，相反的却使农民发生了“吃大锅饭”“快共产呀”的错觉和顾虑。这种事与愿违的教育，值得我们十分注意。第二种情况是有的县级领导对开办冬学是进一步提高群众政治觉悟，推动中心工作，保证工作任务的胜利完成等重要性认识不足，因此，把冬学工作与中心工作割裂开，认为搞冬学是负担，结果对此工作放弃领导，如北狱区的平山及冀鲁豫区的濮县、观城、范县、寿张等县的某些地方都是如此。另一方面，也有的地区在结合上有毛病，把所有工作都当作是中心，不管什么也拿到冬学去讨论，如财粮委员征粮筹款，民政部门的优抗、代耕、妇会派制军鞋等等，弄得冬学很混乱，结果使群众不满意，冬学也收不到应有成绩。因此，我们也必须明确定出一定的中心内容，尽量争取做到有系统的去给群众进行思想教育。第三种情况是只注意了组织冬学的形式，如组织冬学委员会，请教员等，但却忽视了对冬学的实际领导，所以虽开了学也是冷冷清清，不起作用。涉县属于此类的即有九十八个村（全县共二百零九个村），潞城县九十一个村的冬学亦有三十八个村不起作用。冀鲁豫寿张县做了四十处冬学重点村的布置，但办起来的仅五处。这些材料都说明了形式主义的作风还是相当严重的。虽然行政命令，强迫入学，不到罚油的现象在今年是极个别的，干部的领导思想上，对强迫命令已有了一些自觉的了解，但对于形式主义的克服还是很不够的。同时在反对了强迫命令以后也必须防止另一种偏向，如冀中、北岳某些地区在领导上虽然注意了以群众路线自觉自愿的办学方法，可是忽视了有计划有目的去领导群众，提高群众的觉悟，如让群众各找各的教员，冬学无一定课程，群众想听什么，教员就讲什么，有的还提出：“冬学谁愿搞什么，就学什么……”这样放弃领导，形成自流，结果也不会使冬学收到良好的效果。
    识字教育在各地均取得了一定的成绩，如阜平草厂口和平山的东岗南和西庄（皆属北岳区）许多青年自动起来成立了识字班、夜校。晋城吉村妇女识字班每天下午自动到校；方式是随到随学，有的在二十天中已学会八十个字。涉县前寨村有二三十个青年男女组织学习初级课本、写仿、记日记、作文、打算盘，壶关东关壁四十六个青年妇女在二十天内共学写了九百二十盘仿，多的已换过三张影子，少的也换了一张，识字最多的识到一百个字，少的也识了十五六个，且有的学会了写信，如青年妇女冯海年，男人在外参军，从前方写来信，她能够写走回信。这种青年的文化学习，获得了广大的社会同情。如前塞村（涉县）马良老汉在街上说：“一辈子不识一个字，有事就得求人，青年们上冬学买笔买纸，不怕花钱，一定要他们学点才行。”同村张增来老汉看到儿媳妇会写字，就给她买了两枝笔，五十张纸，让儿媳好好学习。
    总起来看，从去年的冬学运动中，应获得三点经验：第一，壮年、老年应以思想教育为主。目前农民虽已有了一些觉悟，但在土改后一般农民觉着压迫他们的地主阶级已被消灭了。几十年来人民恨之入骨的国民党反动派也被打败了，因此，我们今天必须得给农民指出明确方向，给他们深入的进行革命前途教育，在现有基础上把群众的觉悟再提高一步。同时应把民主政府的政策法令如新币、婚姻、反迷信、新农业税等问题，随时进行解释和教育。只有这样才能把社会顺利的向前推进。第二，青年男女应以文化教育为主，尤其在土地改革后翻了身的一些青年男女，迫切要求文化学习，因此，各级必须加强对他们的领导，并从中吸取经验，大力扶助，打下将来彻底扫除文盲的巩固基础。同时在青年中的政治教育也不可忽视，我们一方面要从文化上提高他们，一方面要给他们在思想上树立起明确的革命前途方向。第三，反对形式主义与自流现象，各级领导上必须有具体的组织工作，如有计划有目的集训义务教员，首先把义务教员的思想武装起来，然后通过他们的觉悟去提高广大群众的觉悟，一般是成功的。太行长治县已取得经验，这一方法应推广。同时证明粗枝大叶的向下布置一套，不看具体情况，盲目的形式主义的去开展冬学，或不加领导只跟随群众走的办学方法，也是失败的。
