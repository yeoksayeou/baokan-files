Lenin's great doctrine is increasingly and profoundly influencing the entire course of world history. It provides the working people of millions of capitalist countries with ideological weapons for their liberation struggle. The twenty-five years since Lenin's death have vividly confirmed the enormous international significance of Leninism, which points out to the workers of all countries the only reliable path to liberate themselves from the yoke of imperialism and establish their lives according to the new socialist line.

Lenin's analysis of imperialism and his doctrine of socialist revolution—developed by Comrade Stalin—exposed the irreconcilable contradictions of capitalism and its fatal, erosive sores. In the era of imperialism, the development of capitalism as a whole follows a downward curve. Imperialism is dying, decaying capitalism; for workers, this means increasing unemployment and poverty, rising cost of living, intensified political reaction, and national oppression.

The general crisis of capitalism is manifested in events such as the First World War, the Great October Socialist Revolution, the Second World War, a series of economic crises and depressions in capitalist countries between the two wars, and the growth of national liberation movements in colonies and semi-colonies.

Lenin said in 1922: "Capitalism is dying. Although it is dying, it can still inflict unbelievable suffering on hundreds of millions of people, but no force can save it from collapse. A new society built on the alliance of workers and peasants will inevitably arise. Sooner or later, twenty years earlier or twenty years later, it will come, and it is for this, for this society, that we are helping to plan the form of the alliance of workers and peasants."

The entire process of world development proves the correctness of Lenin's conclusion that the decline of capitalism and the victory of communism are inevitable, and exposes the treacherous nature of capitalism's reformist servants, who are trying to save capitalism from its inevitable demise.

As a result of the Soviet Union's epoch-making victory over fascist countries in the Second World War, several countries in Central and Southeastern Europe broke away from the capitalist system. These countries established people's democratic regimes and embarked on the path of socialist development. A new breach was thus made in the world system of imperialism.

In the people's democratic countries, the power of the working people has been established, led by the working class acting in alliance with the urban and rural working people.

In view of the military defeat of the fascist aggressor countries, the intensified aggravation of the general crisis of capitalism, and the close cooperation between the Soviet Union and the people's democratic countries, it has become possible for the people's democratic countries to realize the transition from capitalism to socialism by maintaining people's democratic power. Relying on the support of the Soviet Union and the people's democratic countries, the people's democratic regime, embodying the rule of the working people under the leadership of the working class, plays the role of the dictatorship of the proletariat in suppressing and eliminating capitalist factors, organizing the socialist economy, and thus solving the various problems in the transition from capitalism to socialism.

Lenin said: "The transition from capitalism to socialism will inevitably generate a wide variety of political forms, but in essence, there will inevitably be only one: the dictatorship of the proletariat."

Lenin and Stalin's view on the international significance of the dictatorship of the proletariat as the essence of various political forms in the transition period from capitalism to socialism has been confirmed in the people's democratic countries, proving it to be a historical truth. The Soviet Communist Party's experience in building a socialist society is of great importance to the people's democratic countries.

The Soviet experience teaches us that it is only through an irreconcilable class struggle against capitalist factors, only on the basis of Marxist-Leninist theory on class struggle in the transition period from capitalism to socialism, and the Leninist-Stalinist doctrine on the leading role of the working class and its political party, that it is possible to move towards socialism, as has been confirmed by the entire historical experience of the Bolshevik Party.

A notable victory of Leninism is the merger of the Communist Parties and Socialist Parties of several people's democratic countries (Poland, Bulgaria, Czechoslovakia, Hungary, Romania) in 1948 on the basis of Marxist-Leninist ideas. In these countries, the disunity that opportunists had maintained in the ranks of the labor movement for decades has been ended. All the best and all the most advanced people of the working class have united in the revolutionary party of Marxism-Leninism, standing under the great banner of Leninism, in order to lead their countries along the path of socialism and democracy.

Comparing the situation in the people's democratic countries with the situation in the Western European countries groaning under the heavy yoke of the enslaving Marshall Plan, the entire difference between the two paths of development, the socialist and the capitalist paths, becomes particularly evident.

In those Western European countries that have lost their sovereignty and independence, whose plans and budgets are determined from overseas, one sees a deepening economic decline. Unemployment, inflation, and the cost of living are all increasing, and the situation of the working masses in these countries is deteriorating. An atmosphere of unease about the future pervades there.

The people's democratic countries, however, present a different picture. Although the war damage suffered by this part of Europe was immeasurably greater, the workers there have seen that, thanks to the people's democratic regime, the national economy and living standards are steadily rising. The working people have already felt that they are the masters of their own destiny and the creators of history. New horizons, socialist horizons, are appearing before them. This is why the people there look to the future with joy and full of confidence.

The new democratic countries can only develop towards socialism through cooperation and friendship with the world's first socialist country—the Soviet Union. In the current international situation, only as a member of the united anti-imperialist democratic camp headed by the Soviet Union can each people's democratic country ensure its independence, autonomy, security, and freedom from imperialist aggression. Loyalty to proletarian internationalism and an irreconcilable attitude towards all forms of nationalism—these Leninist principles are the guarantee of the consolidation and prosperity of the people's democratic countries and the main guarantee of their national freedom and independence. Nationalism, as a bourgeois ideology, is the enemy of Marxism.

Comrade Stalin teaches us that: "The tendency of nationalism is the accommodation of the working class's internationalist policy to the bourgeois national policy; the tendency of nationalism reflects the attempt of the 'own' 'national' bourgeoisie… to restore capitalism."

Today, imperialism is trying to use nationalism as a tool to weaken the anti-imperialist democratic camp. The betrayal of Marxism by the Tito nationalist group, which has broken away from the internationalist united front of the Communist Parties of various countries, has caused elation in the bourgeois camp. However, this joy is premature. The united anti-imperialist camp has become more united and strengthened its forces, and raised the vigilance of the Communist Parties of various countries against nationalism.

Lenin said: "The vast majority of the people on earth were originally educated and trained by capitalism itself to fight." In all capitalist countries, the struggle of the working class against imperialist oppression is growing in momentum. Regardless of cruel persecution and terror, the Communist Parties of various countries are fighting with self-sacrificing spirit for the cause of the working class and for the cause of all working people. The working class is winning over the broad strata of peasants and progressive intellectuals to their side, and uniting them in the struggle for lasting peace, democracy, the vital interests of the working people, and national independence.

The national liberation movement of the people of the East has reached an extremely large scale. When talking about the historical destiny of capitalism and socialism and the historical inevitability of the final victory of socialism, Lenin wrote: "In the final analysis, the future of this struggle will be determined by the fact that Russia, India, China, etc., account for the vast majority of the world's population. And in recent years, it is this vast majority of the population that has been drawn into the struggle for their liberation at an extraordinary speed." Tens of millions of oppressed toiling masses are being educated and trained by capitalism itself to carry out revolutionary struggles, and China is a vivid proof of this. For, indeed, is it not American capitalism that is helping to fan the flames of civil war in China by transporting a large number of modern weapons to aid the Chinese reactionaries? However, despite this, the People's Liberation Army has liberated a considerable part of Chinese territory from the shackles of the reactionaries, and is achieving decisive victories, while the "far-sighted" policy of American imperialists in China has come to a dead end.

The victory of democratic forces in China, as well as the events in Vietnam, Malaya, and Indonesia, confirm Comrade Stalin's words: "The era of peacefully exploiting and oppressing colonies and dependent countries is gone forever."

The enormous vitality of Leninist ideas is deeply reflected in the growth of the Communist Parties and their influence among the masses. Comrade Stalin said: The growth of the influence and prestige of the Communist Parties of various countries among the masses is a law of historical development.

Twenty or twenty-five years ago, the total number of members of foreign Communist Parties was about 500,000, while today, the total number of members of foreign Communist Parties and unified workers' parties is more than 18 million. In 1924, the Chinese Communist Party had only 20,000 members; today, after fighting heroically for the freedom and independence of the Chinese people for twenty-five years, it has more than three million members. The Communist Parties and unified workers' parties are loyal and unwavering fighters against imperialist aggression, and fighters for lasting peace, people's democracy, and socialism.

After the First World War, Lenin wrote that the "idealized democratic republic" of the United States has in fact proved to be the most fearless form of imperialism that oppresses and strangles small and weak nations in the most brutal way. This characteristic described by Lenin is especially true for the expansionist and aggressive policies of the ruling groups in the United States after the Second World War.

The imperialist camp of reactionaries has been opposed by a powerful camp of democracy, peace, and socialism, and the great Soviet state, where Lenin's ideals have been realized, is the fortress and leading force of this camp. The purpose of the foreign policy of the Stalinist Soviet Union is to wage an unwavering struggle against the forces of aggression and instigators of new wars, to expose the expansionist conspiracies of American and British imperialists, and to unite all anti-imperialist forces that are fighting for lasting peace, people's democracy, and the freedom and independence of large and small nations. The Soviet Union firmly protects the sovereignty and independence of all nations, preventing them from being violated by the new aspirants for world hegemony.

The Leninist-Stalinist Soviet foreign policy consolidates and inspires the entire anti-imperialist democratic camp. Now, Lenin's words are being solemnly confirmed: "The vast majority of the people on earth agree with our policy of peace."

The shameless eulogists of the monopoly capitalists arrogantly say: the twentieth century will be "the American century," but the entire course of historical development is pointing out that the twentieth century will never be the century of Wall Street, never the century of those who are trying to "unite" the world with fear. What can unite all nations is not fear but great ideals. The twentieth century will be the century of the complete victory of Leninism, the great ideas of equality and friendship among nations, the ideas of Lenin and Stalin.

　　列宁主义——世界劳动人民解放的旗帜
    真理报总编辑波斯伯洛夫一月二十一日，在莫斯科纪念列宁逝世二十五周年大会上报告的第二部分的摘要
    列宁底伟大学说，愈来愈深刻地影响世界历史的整个进程。它给予资本主义国家千百万劳动人民以解放斗争的思想武器。列宁逝世以来的二十五年，生动地证实了列宁主义的巨大国际重要性，列宁主义向一切国家底工人指点了从帝国主义枷锁下解放出来，并按照新的社会主义的路线建立他们底生活的唯一可靠的道路。
    列宁对帝国主义的分析和他底社会主义革命的学说——经斯大林同志予以发展——揭露了资本主义底不可调和的矛盾及其受侵蚀的致命毒疮。在帝国主义时代，资本主义底发展整个说来是顺着下降的曲线。帝国主义是垂死的、腐朽的资本主义；对于工人来说，这就是增涨的失业和穷困，上升的生活费，加紧的政治反动和民族压迫。
    资本主义的总危机，表现在第一次世界大战，伟大十月社会主义革命，第二次世界大战，两次大战之间资本主义国家中的一连串的经济危机和萧条、以及殖民地、半殖民地民族解放运动底生长等等事件上面。
    列宁在一九二二年说过：“资本主义在灭亡中。虽然它是在灭亡中，却仍可能使亿万人遭受难以置信的痛苦，但没有任何力量能够使它免于崩溃。一个建立在工人与农民的联盟上的新社会，不可避免地要兴起。早二十年或晚二十年，它早晚会要到来，正是为了它，正是为了这个社会，我们正在帮助策划工人与农民联盟的形式。”
    世界发展的整个过程，证明了列宁所说的资本主义底没落和共产主义底胜利是必不可免的这一结论底正确性，并且暴露了资本主义底改良主义奴仆们的叛逆性，他们正力图拯救资本主义于不可避免的灭亡。
    作为苏联在第二次世界大战中对法西斯主义国家的划时代胜利的结果，好几个中欧和东南欧国家脱出了资本主义体系。这些国家建立了人民民主的政体，走上了社会主义发展的道路。帝国主义的世界体系就此被打破了一个新的缺口。
    在人民民主国家中，劳动人民底政权已经建立起来，由与城乡劳动人民结成联盟而行动的工人阶级所领导。
    鉴于法西斯主义侵略国军事上的败北，鉴于资本主义总危机之激烈加剧，并且鉴于苏联与人民民主国家之密切合作，人民民主国家由于保持着人民民主政权而实现从资本主义过渡到社会主义，已成为可能。人民民主政权依靠着苏联与各人民民主国家底支持，体现着工人阶级领导下的劳动人民底统治，在镇压和消除资本主义因素，组织社会主义经济，从而解决从资本主义到社会主义过渡时期的各种问题方面，起着无产阶级专政底作用。
    列宁说过：“从资本主义到社会主义的过渡，必将产生多种多样丰富的政治形式，但在本质上，不可避免地只有一种：无产阶级专政”。
    关于无产阶级专政之作为由资本主义到社会主义过渡时期各种不同政治形式底本质所具有的国际意义，列宁斯大林底观点已在人民民主国家得到证实，证明其为历史性的真理。苏联共产党建设社会主义社会的经验，对于人民民主国家具有极大的重要性。
    苏联底经验教导我们：只有通过对资本主义因素作不调和的阶级斗争，只有根据马克思——列宁主义关于从资本主义到社会主义过渡时期中阶级斗争的理论，和列宁——斯大林主义关于工人阶级及其政党的领导作用的学说，才有可能走向社会主义，这已为布尔什维克党底全部历史经验所证实。
    列宁主义底一个值得指出的胜利，就是在一九四八年，有好几个人民民主国家（波兰、保加利亚、捷克斯洛伐克、匈牙利、罗马尼亚）的共产党和社会党以马列主义思想为基础的合并。在这些国家，机会主义者在劳工运动队伍中保持了数十年之久的不统一状况，已经被结束。工人阶级一切最优秀和一切最先进的人们，已团结在马列主义的革命政党中，站到列宁主义的伟大旗帜之下，以便沿着社会主义和民主的道路领导他们的国家。
    把人民民主国家的情势与那些呻吟于奴役他人的马歇尔计划这一沉重桎梏下的西欧国家的情势比较一下，两种发展道路、社会主义的与资本主义的道路之间的全部不同就变得特别明显了。
    在那些业已丧失其主权与独立，其计划与预算均由海外决定的西欧国家中，人们看到了一种正在越陷越深的经济衰落。失业、通货膨胀、生活费用全部在增长中，这些国家底劳动群众的境遇正在每况愈下。那里弥漫着对未来动荡不安的情绪。
    各人民民主国家却呈现着一幅不同的图画。虽然欧洲这一部分地区所受的战争损害无可衡量地大得多，但是那里的工人们却看到了：由于人民民主政权，国民经济与生活水准正在节节上升。劳动人民业已感觉自己是自己命运底主宰者和历史的创造者。新的地平线、社会主义的地平线正在他们面前显现。这就是那里的人民何以怀着欢乐和充满信心地展望将来的原因。
    新民主主义国家只有与世界上第一个社会主义国家——苏联——合作与友好，才有向社会主义发展的可能。在当前的国际形势下，只有作为以苏联为首的统一的反帝国主义民主阵营底一员，每一个人民民主国家才能确保其独立、自主、安全与不受帝国主义的侵略。忠于无产阶级国际主义与对每一种民族主义持不调和的态度——这些列宁主义的原则，是各人民民主国家巩固与繁荣的保证，是它们民族自由与独立的主要保证。作为资产阶级思想的民族主义，是马克思主义底敌人。
    斯大林同志教导我们说：“民族主义的倾向是工人阶级国际主义政策对资产阶级民族政策的迎合，民族主义的倾向反映着‘自己的’‘民族’资产阶级………恢复资本主义的企图。”
    今天，帝国主义正在力图利用民族主义作为削弱反帝国主义民主阵营的工具。业已脱离了各国共产党国际主义统一阵线的铁托民族主义集团之背叛马克思主义，曾引起资产阶级阵营里的兴高采烈。但是，这种高兴是过早的。统一的反帝国主义阵营业已团结得更加紧密并加强了自己的力量，而且提高了各国共产党对于民族主义的警惕性。
    列宁说：“地球上绝大多数的人民原是资本主义自身教育与锻炼他们去战斗的。”在所有资本主义国家中，工人阶级反对帝国主义压迫的斗争之声势，正在增长着。各国共产党不顾残酷的迫害与恐怖，正在以自我牺牲的精神，为工人阶级底事业，为全体劳动人民底事业而斗争。工人阶级正在赢得农民与进步知识分子的广大阶层站到他们这方面来，并且把他们团结到为持久和平、民主，为劳动人民的切身利益和为民族独立的斗争中。
    东方各国人民底民族解放运动，已达到了极其广大的规模。列宁在谈到资本主义与社会主义底历史命运及社会主义最后胜利之历史的必然性时写道：“最后分析起来，这一斗争底前途将决定于这一事实，即俄国、印度、中国等等在全世界人口中占绝大多数。而在几年来正是这个绝大多数的人口以异常的速度被卷入其求解放的斗争中。”千千万万被压迫的劳苦大众，正被资本主义本身教育着和训练着来进行革命斗争，中国就是一个生动的证明。因为，真的，难道不是美国资本主义以运送大量现代化武器援助中国反动分子而帮助在中国煽起内战的火焰吗？然而，尽管这样，人民解放军已将中国领土底相当大的一部分从反动分子的桎梏下解放出来，并且正在取得决定性的胜利，而美帝国主义者在中国的有“远见”的政策却到了穷途末路。
    中国民主势力底胜利以及越南、马来亚、印尼的事件，证实了斯大林同志的话：“安然剥削与压迫殖民地与附属国的时代已经一去不复返了。”
    列宁主义思想的巨大生命力，深深地反映在各共产党及其在群众中影响的增长上面。斯大林同志说过：各国共产党在群众中的影响与威望之增长，是历史发展底一个规律。
    二十年或二十五年以前，外国共产党党员的总数约为五十万人，而在今天，外国共产党和统一工人党底党员合计在一千八百万人以上。一九二四年，中国共产党只有两万党员，今天，在为中国人民底自由和独立英勇斗争了二十五年之后，已有三百万以上的党员了。共产党和统一工人党是反对帝国主义侵略的忠诚与坚贞不渝的战士，是争取持久和平、人民民主与社会主义的斗士。
    在第一次世界大战以后，列宁写道，美国的“理想化的民主共和国”已在事实上证明是一种最无畏地压迫和绞杀弱小民族的，最狂暴的帝国主义形式。列宁所描写的这种特性，对第二次世界大战以后美国统治集团的扩张主义侵略政策说来尤其真实。
    反动派的帝国主义阵营，已受到强大的民主、和平和社会主义阵营底反对，而列宁底理想已见实现的伟大的苏维埃国家，则是这一阵营底堡垒和领导力量。斯大林主义的苏联底外交政策底目的，在于对侵略势力和新战争挑拨者进行坚定不渝的斗争，揭露美英帝国主义者扩张主义的阴谋，团结一切为持久和平、人民民主和大小民族底自由独立而斗争的反帝国主义力量。苏联坚定地保护着各民族的主权和独立，使其不受争夺世界霸权的新野心家底侵犯。
    列宁——斯大林主义的苏联外交政策，巩固与鼓舞着整个反帝国主义民主阵营。现在，列宁底话正得到了郑重的证实，他说：“地球上绝大多数人民赞同我们底和平政策。”
    独占资本家底大言不惭的歌颂者傲慢地说：二十世纪将是“美国的世纪”，但是，历史发展的全部进程都在指明：二十世纪绝不是华尔街的世纪，绝不是那些正企图以恐惧来“团结”世界的人们底世纪。能够把各民族团结起来的，不是恐惧而是伟大的理想。二十世纪将是列宁主义、各民族平等与友谊的伟大思想、列宁与斯大林的思想取得完全胜利的世纪。　　　　　（新华社陕北八日电）
