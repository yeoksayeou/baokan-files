　　Methods for Selecting and Transferring Cadres in Shulu County
　　You Ren
　　From December 1st to 21st last year, Shulu County, Hebei-Central, transferred a total of 168 cadres and prepared 30 cadres (more than half of whom were serving cadres at the county and district levels). Because of the usual preparation and planning, the vacancies of transferred cadres can be filled immediately; from November to December last year, the county promoted 183 county and district cadres, including 77 who had just separated from production. Therefore, work was not or was only slightly affected.
　　The reasons for the county's achievements are due to the following measures they have taken: (1) Leaders at all levels look downwards, especially the county party committee, which can concentrate its efforts to seriously treat the selection and transfer of cadres as a regular and important task for the whole party. The county party committee grasps cadres down to the village level's main cadres (registering and understanding). The county party committee specifically guides the districts in formulating plans for promoting cadres, and then regularly checks and reports, strictly examines and approves the system, promptly exchanges experience, corrects deviations, and commends achievements; instead of the superior reaching out only to demand, and the inferior either expressing helplessness or randomly grabbing people in the villages. (2) Attention is paid to discovering, cultivating, and promoting cadres from various movements. The county party committee personally took action to help the district level do this at the conclusion of land reform and party rectification under the leadership of the rural areas by designated members of the county committee. (3) Each department cultivates cadres according to its directly subordinate system, and promotes them after approval by the party committee; it is called upon that each district cadre guarantees the regular cultivation of two village cadres, constantly educates them, and replenishes them as needed. (4) Like a snake shedding its skin, gradually replacing, the key lies in the village. For village cadres who are unwilling to leave home for a while, a transitional method of temporarily separating from production to help work is adopted to gradually improve them; for village cadres who have just separated from production but are unwilling to leave their hometown, they are temporarily used in their own area, but the party's education is continuously strengthened to overcome their thinking of "revolution without leaving home". (5) Using all meetings (work meetings and party life meetings), cadres are regularly educated on the party's communist revolutionary future to strengthen their belief in national victory and be prepared to support the national war and national land reform with practical actions; at the same time, oppose the phenomenon of being uneasy at work and wasting time. Strengthen the party's organizational management and discipline education, strengthen organization and discipline, which is the central issue in all problems. (6) For party members and cadres who were more severely punished in the initial party rectification and therefore left their posts, reviews are conducted based on correct policies, and 36 of the 47 cadres who had left their posts have been won over to return to work, and another 4 have been sent to study. Home cadres whose thinking has degenerated are also screened separately and won over and educated. To this day, some people have been transformed and are working for the party again.
　　The main shortcomings currently existing are: the leadership stipulates that in addition to morality, ability, and intelligence, the standard for promoting cadres adds a "learning" item, and there are age and cultural restrictions (such as stipulating that at least literacy is required), this regulation is stable. In addition, individual districts and individual cadres still have the phenomenon of just trying to make up numbers when promoting cadres; or lowering the conditions for cadres without principle based solely on personal preferences, resulting in difficulties in management and delays in work. This erroneous phenomenon remains to be educated and overcome.

　　束鹿县提调干部的方法
    友人
    冀中束鹿县去年十二月一日至二十一日共输出干部一百六十八名，预备干部三十名（其中半数以上是县区在职干部）。由于平时有准备有计划，调出的干部空额能即时补上；该县去年十一月至十二月一个月间，共提拔县区干部一百八十三名，其中初脱离生产者七十七名，因而未曾使工作或少使工作受到影响。
    该县获得这些成绩的原因，是出于他们采取以下诸项办法：（一）各级领导眼睛向下，特别县委能集中力量认真对待，将提调干部列为全党的经常重要任务。县委掌握干部直到村级主要干部（进行登记了解）。县委具体指导区订出提拔干部计划后，又定期检查汇报、严格审查批准制度，及时交流经验，纠正偏向，表扬成绩；而不是上级只伸着手要，下级不是表示无法，便是到村里乱抓。（二）注意从各种运动中去发现培养提拔干部，县委下乡分片领导结束土地改革与整党中，均曾亲自下手帮助区级这样做。（三）各部门均按直属系统培养干部，经党委批准后提拔；号召每个区干保证经常培养两个村干部，经常加以教育，随缺随补。（四）长虫脱皮，逐步顶替，关键在于村。对一时不愿离家之村干部，采取暂时脱离生产帮助工作之过渡办法，逐渐提高之；对刚脱离生产而不愿远离家乡之村干部，暂使用于本地区，但不断加强党的教育，以克服其“革命不离家”的思想。（五）利用一切会议（工作会议与党的生活会议）对在职干部，经常进行党的共产主义的革命前途的教育，加强其全国胜利的信念，随时准备以实际行动支援全国战争与全国土地改革；同时反对因此在工作上惶惶不安心发生混一日少两晌的现象。加强党的组织管理及纪律教育，加强组织性与纪律性，这是一切问题中的中心问题。（六）对初期整党受处分较重因而离职的党员干部，根据正确政策进行复议，四十七名脱职干部已争取其三十六名重返工作岗位，另有四名送学习。对思想堕落之回家干部，亦予分别甄审，加以争取教育，至今改造过来，从新为党工作者亦有若干人。
    目前存在的缺点主要是：领导上规定提拔干部标准除德、才、智三项外，另加一项“学”，并有年龄与文化限制（如规定起码必须识字），这种规定是稳妥的。此外，个别区及个别干部对提拔干部尚有凑数支应现象；或只凭个人爱好无原则的降低干部条件，致管理为难，遗误工作，此种错误现象尚待教育克服。
