Xinhua News Agency, Shenyang, 11th: The Sixth Field Hospital of the Northeast Field Army achieved excellent results in transporting and treating wounded soldiers during the Pingjin Campaign. The hospital set up health clinics near the front lines. When wounded soldiers arrived, the clinics would notify the hospital via telephone, allowing the hospital to prepare in advance. As soon as the wounded arrived, they were quickly placed in different wards according to the severity of their injuries, where doctors and nurses who were already prepared and had assigned tasks promptly provided care, treatment, and first aid. Those who needed to have fixed surgery quickly had splints or plaster casts applied. This not only greatly reduced the pain of the wounded at the time but also significantly reduced the rate of disability and death later on. At the same time, the hospital was good at mobilizing the masses to help with nursing work, truly achieving "every village has a hospital, every family has a ward, everyone is a caregiver." Whenever the hospital arrived at a new location, it would divide all the caregivers into several groups. In addition to promoting the policies of the People's Liberation Army, they specifically told the masses how to care for the wounded. Blackboards were posted daily to commend landlords who took meticulous care of the wounded. When transporting the wounded by train to rear hospitals, the station would send a civilian worker in advance for each car to clean the car, spread straw and mats, and light the stove. Then, the hospital's medical team would assign seats according to the number of wounded and their injuries, and the hospital leaders would personally check to ensure everything was qualified before allowing the wounded to board. Each car had a caregiver for general nursing care and to pay attention to changes in the condition of the seriously wounded. The entire train also had a special nurse's office car with emergency medical equipment to cope with emergencies. The hospital also paid close attention to the diet of the wounded, with food and drinks available upon request. A special cooking car was set up on the train to ensure that the wounded received the necessary nutrition. The twenty-five rear hospitals that received and transported the wounded all praised the work of the Sixth Field Hospital.

　　东北野战军第六兵站医院
  　服务伤员成绩优良
    【新华社沈阳十一日电】平津战役中，东北野战军第六兵站医院，在转运与治疗第一线伤员的工作上，获得优良成绩。该院在接近前线的地方设立卫生所，转来伤员时，卫生所即用电话将伤员的情况通知院部，院部根据情况预作准备。伤员一到，很快就按伤情轻重分别安置于各种不同的病房，由早已有了准备与分工的医生、护士及时进行护理、治疗与急救，应当施行固定手术的，很快就都上了夹板或石膏。这不但大大减少了伤员当时的痛苦，且大大减少了伤员以后的残废率与死亡率。同时该院善于发动群众帮助护理工作，真正做到了“村村设医院，家家设病房，人人当看护”。医院每到一驻地，即将所有看护员分成若干小组，除宣传解放军政策外，并具体告诉群众爱护伤员的方法。每天出黑板报，表扬那些招呼伤员精细周到的房东。转运伤员坐火车到后方医院时，事先每一车厢由兵站派一个民工，将车内打扫清洁，铺上草和席子，生上了火炉，然后由医院护医队员根据伤员数目及各人受伤情况分配车位，再由医院负责同志亲去检查一遍，认为合格后，才让伤员上车。每一车厢中都有看护员，作一般的护理工作，并注意重伤员的病情变化。整个列车上又专设护士办公车，带有急救的医疗器材以应付紧急病情。对于伤员的饮食，该院亦极注意，饭菜随要随开，茶水随要随有。在火车上则专设炊事车，保证伤员得到必须的营养。接收运送伤员的二十五个后方医院，都赞扬第六兵站的工作。
