Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 5th. The Kuomintang reactionary traitorous government's spokesperson gave a reply (full text telegraphed separately) on January 31st, to the Chinese Communist Party spokesperson's statement on the issue of peace negotiations on January 28th. The Kuomintang reactionary traitorous government's spokesperson offered sophistry in this reply regarding the various questions raised by the CCP spokesperson. Regarding the CCP's demand that the Kuomintang reactionary traitorous government be responsible for re-arresting the chief culprit of the Japanese invasion of China, Yasuji Okamura, preparing to send him to the People's Liberation Army, and being responsible for guarding other Japanese war criminals to prevent their escape, the spokesperson said that this "is a judicial issue. This is completely unrelated to peace talks and cannot be a precondition for peace talks." Regarding the CCP's demand that the Kuomintang reactionary traitorous government be responsible for arresting war criminals such as Chiang Kai-shek, it was said that "true peace should not have preconditions." It was also said that the CCP spokesperson's statement "was almost not solemn enough in attitude" and was "a digression." In response, the CCP spokesperson stated: At a time like January 28th, we still referred to the Kuomintang reactionary traitorous government as a government, and in this respect, our attitude was indeed not solemn enough. Does this so-called "government" still exist? Does it exist in Nanjing? There are no administrative organs in Nanjing. Does it exist in Guangzhou? There are no administrative heads in Guangzhou. Does it exist in Shanghai? Shanghai has neither administrative organs nor administrative heads. Does it exist in Fenghua? Fenghua only has a pseudo-president who has announced his "retirement," and nothing else. Therefore, to put it solemnly, it should no longer be regarded as a government; at most, it is only a hypothetical or symbolic government. But we still assume that it has such a symbolic "government," and assume that there is a spokesperson who speaks on behalf of this so-called "government," then the spokesperson should know that this hypothetical symbolic Kuomintang reactionary traitorous government is not only making no contributions to peace negotiations, but is indeed constantly digressing. For example, when you are so eagerly seeking negotiations, you suddenly acquit Yasuji Okamura. Isn't this a digression? After the CCP demanded his re-arrest, he was sent to Japan, and another 260 war criminals were also sent to Japan. Isn't this a digression? Who rules Japan now? Is it the Japanese people who rule, or are imperialist elements ruling? Japan is such a beloved place to you that you believe it is safer, more comfortable, and more justly treated for Japanese war criminals to live in Japan than in the area you control. Is this a judicial issue? Why did this judicial issue arise? Have you forgotten that the Japanese invaders fought us for eight whole years? Is it completely unrelated to peace talks? When the CCP put forward eight articles on January 14th, the release of Yasuji Okamura had not happened. This happened on January 26th, so it should be raised, and it is related to peace talks. On January 31st, you accepted MacArthur's order and sent 260 Japanese war criminals, including Yasuji Okamura, to Japan, which is even more related to peace talks. Why are you asking for peace talks? Because you have been defeated. Why have you been defeated? Because you launched a counter-revolutionary civil war. When did you launch this civil war? After Japan surrendered. Who did you fight this war against? Against the People's Liberation Army and the People's Liberated Areas, who made great contributions in the War of Resistance Against Japan. What forces did you use to fight? In addition to American aid, it was the forces you seized and scraped from the people in your ruling area. The Chinese people and the Japanese invaders had just finished a major showdown, and a war against foreign aggression had just ended, and you launched this internal war. You were defeated, asked for negotiations, and suddenly declared the chief Japanese war criminal, Yasuji Okamura, innocent. We had just protested to you and demanded that you re-imprison him and prepare to hand him over to the People's Liberation Army, and you hurriedly sent Yasuji and the other 260 Japanese war criminals to Japan. Gentlemen of the Kuomintang reactionary traitorous government, what you have done is too unreasonable and too contrary to the will of the people. We now specifically add the words "traitorous" to your title, and you should admit it. Your government has long been a traitorous government. We only omitted these two words sometimes to save writing, but now we cannot omit them. In addition to previous acts of treason, you have now committed another act of treason, and this one is very serious. This issue must be discussed at the peace negotiation conference. Whether you call it a digression or not, this matter must be discussed. Because this happened after January 14th and was not included in the eight conditions we originally put forward, we believe that a item of punishing Japanese war criminals must be added to the first condition. In this way, this article will have two items, namely: (A) Punish Japanese war criminals; (B) Punish domestic war criminals. We put forward this item for a reason, reflecting the will of the people across the country. The people of the whole country want to punish Japanese war criminals. Even within the Kuomintang, many people believe that punishing Japanese war criminals such as Yasuji Okamura is as natural as punishing domestic war criminals such as Chiang Kai-shek. Whether you say we have sincerity for peace or not, these two types of war criminal issues must be negotiated and punished. Regarding asking you to arrest a group of civil war criminals before the negotiations and preventing these war criminals from escaping, you believe that "there should be no preconditions." Gentlemen of the Kuomintang reactionary traitorous government, this is not a precondition, but a natural requirement arising after you acknowledge the punishment of war criminals as a basis for negotiation. Asking you to arrest them is to prevent the war criminals from running away. While we have not yet prepared for the negotiations, you are so anxiously seeking negotiations like bereaved parents, you are so idle that you are asked to do a reasonable job. These war criminals will always be arrested, even if they run to the ends of the earth. You are those who are willing to "shorten the war time," "reduce the people's suffering," and "take saving the people as the premise," those who are great and compassionate, saving people from suffering, those who have many kind hearts, and you should have no love for those responsible for slaughtering millions of compatriots. Judging from your willingness to use the punishment of war criminals as a basis for negotiation, you do not seem to cherish these things very much. But since you declare that it seems difficult to arrest these things immediately, then so be it, you just prevent them from escaping, and by no means let these things run away. Gentlemen, please think about it, when you painstakingly send a delegation to discuss the issue of punishing war criminals with us, the war criminals have already run away, then what else is there to talk about, what glory is there on the faces of your delegation members? How can your so much "peace sincerity" be shown? How can Mr. Ming be truly willing to "shorten the war time," "reduce the people's suffering," and "take saving the people as the premise," and not be fake at all? In addition, the spokesperson said a lot of nonsense, which cannot deceive anyone, and we believe that there is no need to answer it. The hypothetical symbolic Kuomintang reactionary traitorous "government" in Nanjing or Guangzhou or Fenghua or Shanghai, pay attention, gentlemen with the word "government" in quotation marks, if you think that our statement is not solemn enough in attitude, then please forgive us, we can only take this attitude towards you.

　　对国民党卖国“政府”又犯严重卖国罪
  　中共发言人发表声明
    惩办战犯一项必须加上惩办日本战犯
    【新华社陕北五日电】上月二十八日中国共产党发言人关于和平谈判问题的声明，到上月三十一日得到了国民党反动卖国政府发言人的答复（全文另电）。国民党反动卖国政府的发言人在这个答复里，对于中共发言人所提出的各项问题，提出了狡辩。对于中共要求国民党反动卖国政府负责重行逮捕日本侵华罪魁冈村宁次，准备押送人民解放军，并负责看管其他日本战犯勿令逃逸一节，该发言人说，这“是一个司法问题。这完全与和谈无关，更不能作为和谈的先决条件”。对于中共要求国民党反动卖国政府负责逮捕战争罪犯蒋介石等人一节，说是“真正的和平不应有先决条件。”并且说中共发言人的声明“态度上几乎不够郑重”，而且是“节外生枝”。对此，中共发言人声明：在一月二十八日那种时候，我们还把国民党反动卖国政府说成是一个政府，在这点上说来，我们的态度确乎不够郑重。这个所谓“政府”究竟还存在不存在呢？它是存在于南京吗？南京没有行政机关。它是存在于广州吗？广州没有行政首脑。它是存在于上海吗？上海既没有行政机关，又没有行政首脑。它是存在于奉化吗？奉化只有一个宣布“退休”了的伪总统，别的什么都没有。因此，郑重地说起来，已经不应当把它看成一个政府，它至多只有一个假定的或象征的政府了。但是我们仍然假定它有那么一个象征的“政府”，并且假定有一个是以代表这个所谓“政府”发言的发言人，那么，该发言人应当知道，这个假定的象征的国民党反动卖国政府，现在不但对于和平谈判毫无建树，而且确确实实地是在不断地节外生枝。例如当着你们如此急切地要求谈判的时候，忽然判决冈村宁次无罪，这难道不是节外生枝吗？在中共要求予以重行逮捕以后，又把他送往日本，并且把其他二百六十名战犯也送往日本，这难道不是节外生枝吗？日本现在是什么人统治呢？难道是日本人民统治而不是帝国主义分子在统治吗？日本是你们如此热爱的地方，以致于使你们相信日本战犯们生活在你们统治的区域，还不如使他们生活在日本较为安全些，较为舒服些，较为受到正当待遇些。这是一个司法问题吗？为什么发生这个司法问题呢？难道日本侵略者和我们打了八个整年这件事，你们也忘了吗？完全与和谈无关吗？一月十四日中共提出八条的时候，并没有发生释放冈村宁次这件事情。一月二十六日这件事情发生了，就应提出了，就与和谈有关了。一月三十一日你们接受麦克阿瑟的命令，又将日本战犯二百六十名连同冈村宁次一起送往日本，就更与和谈有关了。为什么你们要求和谈呢？是因为你们打了败仗。你们为什么打败仗呢？是因为你们发动反人民的国内战争。你们在什么时候发动这次国内战争呢？是在日本投降以后。你们发动这次战争是打谁呢？是打在抗日战争中立了大功的人民解放军和人民解放区。用什么力量来打呢？除了美国援助之外，是在你们统治区域从人民方面捉来和刮来的力量。中国人民和日本侵略者一场大决斗刚刚完毕，一个对外战争刚刚完毕，你们就发动这次对内战争。你们打败了，要求谈判，忽然又宣告日本首要战犯冈村宁次无罪。我们刚刚向你们提出抗议，要求你们从新监禁并准备交给人民解放军，你们又慌忙将冈村及其他二百六十名日本战犯一齐送往日本。国民党反动卖国政府的先生们，你们这件事做得太无道理了，太违反人民意志了。我们现在特地在你们的头衔上加上卖国二字，你们应当承认了。你们的政府很久以来就是卖国政府，仅仅为了节省文字起见，有时我们省写了这两个字，现在不能省了。你们除去历次卖国罪以外，现在又犯了一次卖国罪，而且这一次犯得很严重，和平谈判会议上必得谈这个问题。无论你们叫节外生枝也好，不叫节外生枝也好，这件事必得谈。因为这件事是发生在一月十四日以后的，没有包括在我们原来所提的八个条件以内，因此我们认为必须在第一个条件中增加惩办日本战犯一个项目。这样，这一条就有两个项目，即是：（甲）惩办日本战争罪犯；（乙）惩办国内战争罪犯。我们提出这个项目是有理由的，是反映全国人民意志的。全国人民都要惩办日本战犯。即在国民党内，也有许多人认为惩办冈村宁次等日本战争罪犯和惩办蒋介石等国内战争罪犯一样是理所当然。无论你们谈我们是有和平诚意也好，没有和平诚意也好，这两类战犯问题都得谈判，都得惩办。关于叫你们在谈判之前逮捕一批内战罪犯和防止这些战犯逃跑的问题，你们认为“不应有先决条件”。国民党反动卖国政府的先生们，这不是先决条件，这是你们承认惩办战犯一条为谈判基础之后自然产生的要求。叫你们逮捕，是怕战犯们跑掉。当着我们在谈判的准备工作还没有做好的时候，你们如丧考妣地急着要谈判，你们闲得发慌，因此叫你们做一件合理的工作。这些战犯总是要逮捕的，任凭他们跑到天涯海角也是要逮捕的。你们是愿意“缩短战争时间”、“减轻人民痛苦”、“以拯救人民为前提”的大慈大悲救苦救难的人们，你们是有很多的好心眼儿的人们，你们对于这些屠杀几百万同胞的负责者应当没有什么爱惜。从你们愿意以惩办战犯作为一条谈判基础这一点来看，你们似乎也并不很爱惜这些东西。但是既然你们声明叫你们马上逮捕这些东西显得颇有为难之处，那么也罢，你们就防止他们逃跑罢，千万莫叫这些东西跑掉了。先生们，请想一想，当着你们辛辛苦苦地派出代表团和我们讨论惩办战犯问题的时候，战犯们已给跑了，那么还谈什么呢，你们代表团先生们的脸上还有什么光彩呢？你们那样多的“和平诚意”从何表现呢？怎么可以让明先生们是真的愿意“缩短战争时间”，“减轻人民痛苦”，“以拯救人民为前提”，而没有一点儿假呢？此外，该发言人还说了许多费话，这些费话是骗不了任何人的，我们认为没有答复的必要。南京或广州或奉化或上海的假定的象征的国民党反动卖国“政府”注意，政府二字加上引号的先生们，如果你们以为我们的这篇声明的态度又有什么不够郑重的话，那么，请原谅，我们对你们只能取这种态度。
