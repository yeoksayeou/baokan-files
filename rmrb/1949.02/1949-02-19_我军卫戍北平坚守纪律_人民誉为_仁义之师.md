Xinhua News Agency, Beiping, 17th:

　　The Northeast Field Army unit garrisoning Beiping is praised by the people of Beiping as a "Benevolent and Righteous Army" because their life and actions demonstrate a genuine commitment to safeguarding the interests of the people. After entering the city, the majority of the unit lived in empty rooms that had neither beds nor straw mats. Although some companies and platoons were stationed in places with piles of coal left by the enemy, the soldiers preferred to sleep on the cold ground rather than burn a single piece of coal or casually borrow anything from the citizens. Some empty rooms had floors of cold lime, so the soldiers slept back to back to keep warm. When a certain company was on guard duty in the commercial district, all the officers and soldiers slept on the cold streets in the howling north wind, thoroughly implementing the superior's order of "do not enter civilian houses, do not stay in shops." Many local citizens, moved by the people's army's spirit of caring for the people and enduring hardship, came out three times during the night to invite the company's officers and soldiers into their homes to sleep, and offered them quilts, mats, and straw. However, the company politely declined all of these offers. As the night deepened and the weather became too cold, the cadres led the soldiers in stamping their feet to keep warm. Because firewood and food had not been delivered in time, the unit ate the dry rations they had brought with them for two consecutive days. Many landlords, seeing the soldiers gnawing on dry biscuits, brought them noodles and steamed buns. The landlord of a certain company sent dumplings four times, but the soldiers, in order to thoroughly implement the principle of "not taking a single needle or thread from the masses," did not accept the landlord's kindness. Some companies even seriously discussed whether drinking cold water from the villagers counted as violating the rules of mass discipline. They reasoned that the water was also bought with the citizens' money. Therefore, the cooks of the troops stationed near the outskirts of the city fetched water from outside the city to drink. The troops stationed in the city center uniformly paid for the water they drank. Many citizens reflected, "Your troops are too good, it makes us feel too bad." When soldiers from a certain company had to go up on the roof to stand guard, everyone proposed "to be careful not to break the tiles," and even when going up and down the stairs, they said, "Walk slowly, don't break the stairs." On the second day of the Lunar New Year, a certain company made dumplings to eat. They had no furniture, but in order to abide by the custom that citizens should not lend things out during the first few days of the Spring Festival, they sharpened their bayonets to cut the meat and used tree branches as rolling pins. The eighth squad of a certain company knew that the landlord was a Muslim. Squad leader Gao Fengxin told the whole squad, "We must abide by the customs of the Hui people and not borrow furniture from the landlord to cook." The old landlord was happy to hear this and said, "The People's Liberation Army is really good. When the Kuomintang lived here, they not only borrowed furniture indiscriminately but also slaughtered black livestock (pigs) in my house!" The citizens said affectionately, "With the Benevolent and Righteous Army stationed here, the people can live and work in peace and contentment."

### 我军卫戍北平坚守纪律　人民誉为“仁义之师”

　　我军卫戍北平坚守纪律
  　人民誉为“仁义之师”
    【新华社北平十七日电】卫戍北平的东北野战军某部，被北平人民誉为“仁义之师”，因为他们的生活行动，处处表现真正维护人民的利益。该部入城后，大部是住在既没有床也没有铺草的空房里，个别营连的驻地虽然堆着不少敌人遗留的煤炭，但战士们宁愿挨着冻睡在冰凉的地下。不烧一块煤，也不随便向市民借东西。有的空房里的石灰地太凉了，战士们就背靠背地睡觉。某连在商业区放警戒时，全连指战员在北风呼啸的寒冷的街头睡了一夜，彻底执行了上级“不入民宅、不住商店”的规定。当地许多市民看到人民军队这种爱护人民的刻苦精神，曾感动得一夜出来三次，请该连全体指战员进屋去睡，并纷纷送被子席子铺草给解放军，但都被该连婉言谢绝了。夜深天气太冷，干部们就领着战士踏脚取暖。由于柴草粮食没有及时运到，该部曾连着两天吃着自己带来的干粮。许多房东看到战士们啃着干饼子，就送来面条和馒头。某连房东曾四次送饺子，战士们为了彻底实现“不拿群众一针一线”而没有收受房东的人情。有的连队甚至认真地讨论起喝老乡的冷水是不是算犯群众纪律。他们想到水也是市民花钱买的，因此，住在靠近城外的部队的炊事员就从城外挑水进来喝。住在城中心的部队，就统一实行喝水给钱。许多市民反映说：“你们这个部队太好了，就是叫我们太过意不去了。”某连战士要上屋顶放哨时，大家提出“愿意不要踩碎了瓦”，甚至上下楼时也叫“慢点走，别踏坏了楼梯”。某连旧年初二包饺子吃，什么家具都没有，但为了遵守市民在春节头几天不往外借东西的习惯，就把刺刀磨快了切肉，用树木棍子杆面。某连八班知道房东信回教，班长高丰信告诉全班“要遵守回民的风俗，不向房东借家具作饭”。房东老大爷在旁边听到后高兴地说：“解放军真好，国民党在这住时，不但乱借家具，还在我家杀黑牲口（猪）呢！”市民们亲切地说：“仁义之师常驻这里，人民就可安居乐业了。”
