Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, February 5th: The Kuomintang's reactionary and traitorous "government's" news agency, the Central News Agency, published on January 31st a response from the Kuomintang's reactionary and traitorous "government" spokesperson to the Chinese Communist Party (CCP) spokesperson's statement of January 28th. The full text is as follows: (Central News Agency, Nanjing, January 31st) The government spokesperson issued a reply statement on the 31st regarding the CCP's statement on the 28th. According to a New China News Agency dispatch from Northern Shaanxi on the 28th, the CCP spokesperson issued a statement regarding the peace proposals put forward by the government. The opinions they raised in the statement can be summarized as follows: (1) They cannot agree with the acquittal of Japanese war criminal Neiji Okamura; (2) They believe that the so-called "war criminals" they have proposed should be arrested by the government first in order to demonstrate the government's sincerity for peace; (3) The government's attitude towards the local peace work in Peiping is not serious enough. Regarding this statement, our first impression is that the attitude is almost not "serious" enough, but we are still willing to calmly answer it. Regarding the Okamura Neiji case, it is a judicial issue. This is completely unrelated to the peace talks and cannot be used as a prerequisite for peace talks. The government handles many affairs every day. If the CCP side raises issues like this, one today and one tomorrow, then we will not only ××××××××, but will also be unable to approach ×. Secondly, regarding the proposal to arrest "war criminals" first. We believe that since both sides are preparing for peace talks today, and the government has already acknowledged its willingness to hold negotiations based on the eight conditions proposed by the CCP, then all the proposed conditions should of course be resolved in the meeting, and must not be requested to be implemented before holding the meeting. If it is said that the conditions do not need to be discussed and can be implemented, then why would we need peace talks? This may make people doubt the CCP's sincerity for peace. We cannot help but deeply regret this, because true peace should not have preconditions. In the past, we advocated for a ceasefire before peace talks, and the CCP criticized us for the same reason, saying that we were not sincere, didn't they? Regarding the third point, they did not provide specific content, so we cannot answer it. In short, we feel that everyone, whether on the government side or the CCP side, should first have a correct basic concept, which is that the demand for peace today is the common will of the people of the whole country. We are seeking a way to resolve domestic disputes through political means in order to follow public opinion. We must respect each other and be tolerant of each other in order to allow the peace talks to begin quickly and proceed smoothly. Whoever is not sincere will be blamed and opposed by the people. At the same time, we hope that the CCP side understands that the government side today is not unable to fight again, but is unwilling to fight again, and cannot bear to fight again, because today's country and people really cannot withstand the persecution and devastation of war. If we acknowledge that the purpose of the revolution is for the benefit of the people and the country, and that the motivation of the revolution is based on the will of the majority of the people, then in today's situation where the country and people are suffering so much, and where the people of the whole country are demanding peace, we have absolutely no reason to continue engaging in war. At the same time, we should understand the current war situation. Although the Communist army has won several battles and occupied several cities in the past few months, temporary military advantages are not enough to determine the final victory; and war can never solve problems, this is a lesson of history. Only through political means can everything be resolved, and only by tolerating each other for the sake of the country and being open and honest with each other can we permanently eliminate the scourge of war and establish lasting peace. As for what the spokesperson said, "You have angered the people, the people have united to oppose you and fight you desperately, the people do not like you, and you have turned around to seek peace." There is originally no need to respond to this point, but according to what we know, the people in the CCP areas today are still living a very painful life, and the people and students in the CCP-occupied areas are fleeing to the government areas one after another. This is an ironclad fact. Regarding this point, we are only mentioning it in passing and do not want to provoke debate. Fortunately, the facts can speak for us, and the people's hearts have fair judgment. To sum it up, we are working for the realization of peace for the sake of the country and the people. The people are yearning for the arrival of peace. We sincerely hope that the CCP side will also promote the early convening of peace conferences and the early cessation of war with the highest sincerity. This is not only the government's wish, but also the wish of the people of the whole country. (Note: The × in the text are due to garbled telegrams.)

### 国民党卖国反动“政府”　狡辩释放日本战犯

　　国民党卖国反动“政府”
  　狡辩释放日本战犯
    【新华社陕北五日电】国民党反动卖国“政府”的通讯社中央社于一月三十一日发表国民党反动卖国“政府”发言人对中共发言人一月二十八日的声明的答复。全文如下：（中央社南京三十一日电）政府发言人三十一日对中共二十八日声明发表答复声明于次。据陕北二十八日新华社电，中共发言人对政府所提和平意见发表了一个声明。在该项声明中，他们提出的意见归纳起来，大致是：（一）对日本战犯冈村宁次宣判无罪表示不能同意；（二）对他们提出的所谓“战犯”应由政府先行逮捕，才足以表示政府和平的诚意；（三）对于北平的局部和平工作，政府表示的态度不够郑重。对于这一个声明，我们首先感觉到的×，就是态度上几乎不够“严重”，但是我们仍然愿意平心静气来加以解答。关于冈村宁次一案，是一个司法问题。这完全与和谈无关，更不能作为和谈的先决条件。政府每天处理的事务很多，如果中共方面象这样节外生枝，今天提出一项，明天提出一项，那我们不特××××××××，而无法接近×了。其次说到“战犯”应先行逮捕一项。我们以为今天双方既是要准备进行和谈，同时政府方面又已承认愿意以中共所提八项条件为基础举行谈判，那么所有提出来的条件当然都应该在会议中求×决，决不能先要求执行，然后才举行会议。如果说条件不必谈，便可以执行，试问又何必需要和谈。这样也许会使人民怀疑到共方对和平是否真有诚意的问题，对于这点，我们不能不深致惋惜，因为真正的和平不应该有先决条件。以前我们曾主张先停战再谈和，共方不也曾以同样的理由批评我们，说我们是没有诚意吗？关于第三点，他们没有提出具体的内容，我们无从答复。总之，我们觉得我们大家无论是政府方面或中共方面都应该先有一个正确的基本观念，就是今天要求和平是全国人民共同的意旨，我们是为遵循民意来求到以政治方式解决国内纠纷的办法，必须彼此尊重，彼此忍让，才能使和谈迅速开始，顺利进行。谁要没有诚意，谁就会受到人民的责难与反对。同时我们希望中共方面要知道政府方面今天并不是不能再战，而是不愿再战，不忍再战，因为今天的国家和人民，实在已经受不起战争的迫害与摧残。如果我们承认革命的目的是为着人民和国家的利益，革命的动机是基于大多数人民的意旨，那么在国家人民痛苦到如此地步的今天，全国人民都在要求和平的今天，我们是决没有要继续从事战争的理由。同时，我们应该了解今天的战争形势，虽然共军在以往几个月内打了几次胜仗，占领了几个城市，但是一时的军事优势决不足以决定最后的胜利；而且战争也决不能解决问题，这是历史的教训。惟有用政治方式才能解决一切，也惟有大家相忍为国，开诚相见，才能永弭战祸，永奠和平。至于该发言人所说，你们激怒了人民，人民一致起来反对你们，和你们拼命，人民不喜欢你们，你们才反过来求和平。此点原无答辩之必要，但是据我们所知道的，今天在中共区域内的人民也依旧过着非常痛苦的生活，而且在中共占领区中的人民和学生都纷纷的逃向政府区域来，这是一个铁的事实。关于这一点，我们在此不过顺便提一提，决不愿因此惹起论辩。好在事实能给我们言明，人民的心里自有公平的判断。归总一句，我们是为着国家和人民来谋取和平之实现，人民都在渴望着和平的到来，我们惟有诚恳的希望中共方面也以最高的诚意来促成和平会议早日召开，使战争早日停止，这不仅是政府方面的愿望，也就是全国人民的愿望。（按：文中有×的均因电码脱落）
