　　[Xinhua News Agency, Tanggu, 4th] In the battle to pursue and annihilate the fleeing enemy troops at Tanggu and Dagu on January 16th, the People's Liberation Army eliminated a total of 3,400 enemy soldiers. Among them, 440 were killed or wounded, and 2,960 were captured alive. This includes the complete annihilation of the first and second battalions of the 285th Regiment of the Independent 95th Division, a portion of the third battalion and directly subordinate units of the regiment, a portion of the 259th Regiment of the 318th Division of the 92nd Army, and portions of the directly subordinate units of the 87th Army and the 222nd and 664th Regiments. The captured equipment includes 44 artillery pieces of various types, 18 heavy machine guns, 107 light machine guns, and 1,773 rifles and carbines.
　　[Xinhua News Agency, Tianjin, 4th] Democratic order is being established in Tanggu City, the trading port of North China, after its liberation. After the Tanggu branch of the Tianjin Military Control Commission sent personnel to take over Tanggu New Port and its Engineering Bureau, over 2,000 workers and over 70 staff members have registered to return to work. The workers have begun repairing workshops and starting work. The 1,000-kilowatt generator of the Engineering Bureau has started supplying electricity, restoring light to the entire port, and the water supply is also intact. The China Petroleum Corporation warehouse, formerly under the National Government's reactionary Resources Committee, was completely taken over by the Military Control Commission. The workers inside the factory are in high spirits and are actively preparing to resume work. Even the staff members who fled to Tianjin after believing rumors spread by Kuomintang secret agents are returning to the factory to report for duty. He Danbao, a technician at the factory, organized a picket team to guard the warehouse day and night. One member of the picket team said, "The oil storage facility is inseparable from our rice bowls!" The customs wharf warehouse in the city was set on fire twice by the Kuomintang bandit troops during their retreat, but was extinguished by the workers. Fourteen workers voluntarily guard the warehouse, awaiting takeover by the People's Government. The small steamer from Tanggu to Haikou is still sailing as usual. The workers love the Communist Party and the People's Liberation Army. A dockworker said to the PLA soldiers, "What the Communist Party broadcasts on the radio, publishes in the newspapers, and says in meetings, is that they love the working class so much. Now we have seen it with our own eyes, and we are indescribably happy!"
