　　Shijiazhuang's People's Education Center
    　　　　I. Book and Newspaper Work
    The books and newspapers in the People's Education Center were gradually acquired. As of the October statistics last year, there were 6,751 books and 19 kinds of newspapers, totaling 52 copies. Regarding the promotion of reading books and newspapers, in the initial stage, due to the citizens' lack of awareness and habit of learning new knowledge, as well as insufficient proactive publicity and organization, only 50 people borrowed books in the 20 days after the opening, and only about 20 people read newspapers a day, and more than 80% were cadres and students. In order to change this situation, efforts were made to expand borrowing by using newspaper and blackboard publicity, promoting through districts and streets, and mobilizing through individual relationships. At the same time, since May of this year, in order to facilitate citizens' reading of books and newspapers, three book and newspaper reading rooms have been established successively in parks, teahouses and other places with large crowds. According to statistics in July and August, an average of 102 people read books and newspapers each month. In areas with relatively dense populations, with the assistance of enthusiastic merchants and citizens, 11 book lending points have been established successively, lending books to nearby residents through the personal and industry relationships of commercial firms, which has been very effective. According to statistics, by the end of June, the number of borrowing households had grown to more than 1,400, and by the end of August it had grown to more than 3,100. In July and August alone, 2,820 books were borrowed, and those borrowed from book lending points accounted for one-third of the books borrowed in July and August. This is a new creation and characteristic of book borrowing work. According to a survey of borrowing members, in February, cadres accounted for 31%, students accounted for 41%, and ordinary citizens (including industry and commerce) accounted for 28%. According to the statistics of 1,190 people in August, cadres accounted for 27.1%, students accounted for 12.5%, and ordinary citizens accounted for 60.4%. The proportion of citizens borrowing books has increased significantly. Now the books in the People's Education Center have actually become the cultural food for the masses and are warmly welcomed by citizens. As a restaurant worker Liu Xiaopi said: "It costs tens of thousands of yuan to buy a book, but it doesn't cost money to borrow books from the People's Education Center. Now the People's Education Center is really serving the people."
    Regarding the management of books and newspapers, this is a set of scientific and meticulous organizational work. The management of newspapers adopts the method of sorting out once a day, ordering a small number every half month, and ordering a large number every month. At least one complete copy of each newspaper must be kept for borrowing and reference; the rest are clipped and pasted separately, mainly as internal reference materials. The management of books is divided into broad categories according to different natures. Broad categories are divided into small categories, small categories are divided into detailed items, and detailed items are divided into book types, and then numbered according to book types. According to existing new books, they are divided into eight categories: literature and art, natural science, history and geography, education, economics, politics, philosophy, and popular reading materials. For book lending, the old deposit system has been abolished. For citizens, students, and cadres borrowing books, a book borrowing card system is adopted. The borrowing card can be obtained with proof from shops, schools, and institutions. For institutions borrowing reference books, a note system is adopted. The person in charge of the institution signs and stamps the note to borrow books. For temporary borrowing within the center, a registration method is adopted. In addition, a seven-day book return system, a loss and damage compensation system, and a system that prohibits circling, marking, and modifying books have been established. Although this deposit-free book borrowing method is inevitable to have some losses, experience has proved that it is still suitable for smaller cities and is convenient for citizens to learn. In order to reduce losses, it is mainly necessary to organize and inspect frequently.
    Regarding the replenishment of books and newspapers, due to the small scale of the library, poor equipment, and insufficient funding, it is necessary to purchase and supplement with emphasis according to the needs of the masses. In terms of newspapers, first, subscribe to local newspapers; second, subscribe to out-of-town industrial and commercial newspapers for industrialists and businessmen to read; third, subscribe to newspapers from nearby areas, because they are closely related to the people of this city and citizens are more concerned about them. In terms of books, current needs are the main priority, followed by those for reference. At present, citizens and students most like to borrow literary novels, workers and engineers with high cultural levels need industrial science books, businessmen need policy pamphlets, and staff and cadres mainly need political and literary books. Currently, the most lacking are industrial and natural science books, so the requirements of engineers, technicians, factory managers and some workers cannot be met, which urgently needs to be purchased.
    There was no library in this city in the past. According to the facts in the past year since liberation, in order to meet the increasingly broad reading requirements of the masses, it is indeed necessary to spend a certain amount of effort to prepare a library of a certain scale.
    　　　　II. Exhibition Work
    According to the past exhibitions, they can be roughly divided into regular exhibitions in the center, mobile exhibitions outside the center, and temporary organized physical exhibitions. The former mainly includes cartoons, photographs and other art works, and the latter mainly includes charts and texts (such as wall newspapers). The latter mainly includes industrial products, followed by other physical objects (such as congratulatory streamers, plaques and trophies celebrating the establishment of the North China People's Government). The organization of exhibitions mainly relies on self-organized events, but also joint events with other institutions, and commissioned events. In terms of the content and direction of the exhibitions, in general, they are all in line with the central work, commemorating festivals and the development of the situation. They have a certain center, purpose, and plan to carry out current political and policy propaganda. For example, for each major commemorative festival, exhibitions with educational significance related to the festival were held. In line with the task of developing industry and commerce, industrial finished product exhibitions were held. In line with the registration of Kuomintang personnel, exhibitions of various story paintings such as the crimes of the Kuomintang and the confession of strayed elements were held. In line with current affairs education, exhibitions of the Liu-Deng army crossing the Yellow River to the south, and the great victories of Linfen and Jinzhong were held. In line with the celebration of the establishment of the North China People's Government, exhibitions of photos of the North China Provisional Congress and congratulatory streamers, plaques and other related materials were held. In terms of the form of the exhibitions, the exhibition halls of the general center and branch centers are regular and fixed. Mobile exhibitions outside the center include street posters, market and street exhibitions, and small-scale exhibitions using institutions, schools, troops, and spare time. Physical exhibitions are mainly industrial products, mostly jointly organized with industrial and commercial departments. Some are comprehensive exhibitions, and some are more specialized. In the exhibition, in order to achieve better publicity and educational effects, it is necessary to organize special personnel to conduct guidance and explanation. The facts prove that the quality of guidance and explanation is closely related to the effect of the exhibition.
    In the past year, the exhibition hall in the center has changed its content more than a dozen times, street posters have been published in 14 issues, 30 centralized street exhibitions have been held, 12 exhibitions have been held in factories, schools and troops, and 4 industrial product exhibitions have been held. Every exhibition is crowded with visitors. According to the statistics of the exhibition hall in the center, on December 20 last year, 760 people were counted in 8 hours. During the two major festivals of "May 1st" and "July 1st", there were more than 3,800 people. On August 17, there were 2,360 people. Even when airplanes were disturbing, there were still 600 to 700 people every day. According to the statistics of the street poster exhibition on the "March 8th" festival, there were more than 1,100 visitors. The total number of visitors to the three industrial product exhibitions was nearly 30,000.
    The facts show that this is the most popular publicity and education method, especially in densely populated cities, and therefore its effect is relatively large. Just listen to the masses' reactions when visiting the exhibition to prove it. For example, during the March 8th festival, a woman from Dongli Village visited the women's production photos and the "White Haired Girl" comic strip, and said to the cadres of the People's Education Center: "I used to say that you were short here and long there, just talking nonsense. Now that women can walk anywhere alone, they are not afraid of accidents." Many people said after seeing the photos of the Liu-Deng army's southward expedition: "I didn't really believe that they crossed the Yellow River. Now that I see the army has reached the Dabie Mountains, there's no mistake this time!"

　　石家庄的民教馆
    　　　　一、书报工作
    民教馆的书报是逐渐添置设备起来的，截至去年十月份统计，书籍已有六千七百五十一本，报纸十九种五十二份。关于阅读书报的推广工作，开始时期，由于市民缺乏学习新知识的认识和习惯，以及主动的宣传组织不够，致使在开馆后二十天中只有五十人借书，看报的一天不过二十人，并且干部学生即占百分之八十以上。为了改变这种情况，曾采用了登报、黑板报宣传，通过区街推广和利用个别关系动员，扩大借书面。同时，自今年五月以后，为便于市民阅览书报，先后在公园茶馆等群众众多的场所，建立了书报阅览处三处，七八两月份统计看书看报者平均每月一百零二人，并在人口比较稠密的地区，依靠热心文化事业的商户、市民的协助，先后建立了图书代借处十一处，通过商行的个人、行业关系，向外借书，供附近居民阅读，很有成效。据统计六月底借书户已发展到一千四百余人，八月底则发展到三千一百余人，而七、八两月份即借出图书二千八百二十本，七、八两月份借出的书籍，由图书代借处借出者即占三分之一，这是图书借阅工作的新的创造和特点。根据借书成员的调查，二月份干部占百分之三十一，学生占百分之四十一，一般市民（包括工商）占百分之二十八。八月份据一千一百九十人的统计；干部占百分之二十七点一，学生占百分之十二点五，一般市民则占百分之六十点四，市民借书的比重已大大增加，现在民教馆的图书实际上已成了群众的文化食粮，受到市民的热烈欢迎，正如一个饭馆的伙计刘小皮说：“买一本书化几万元，到民教馆借书也不要钱，如今的民教馆真是为人民服务”。
    关于书报的管理，这是一套科学的细腻的组织工作，对报纸的管理采用了一天整一次，半月一小订，一月一大订的办法，每种报纸至少要留完整的一份，以供借阅参考：其余分别剪贴，主要作为内部的参考资料；对图书的管理，是根据不同性质，分成大类。大类分小类，小类分细目，细目分书别，再按书别编号，根据现有新书分为文艺、自然科学、史地、教育、经济、政治、哲学、大众读物等八大类；图书外借，废除了旧的押金制度，对市民学生干部借书，都采用借书证制，由店铺学校机关证明担保即可领取借书证凭证借书。对机关借阅参考书，采用便条制，由机关负责人签名盖章，凭条借书，对馆内临时借阅，则采用记名登记办法；此外还定了七天为限的还书制，损失破坏赔偿制，和不准在书上圈点、涂改的制度。这种取消押金的借书办法，虽难免有所损失，但经验证明，在不太大的城市还是适合的，对市民学习是方便的。为了减少损失，主要应该经常整理、检查。
    关于图书报纸的充实问题，由于图书室规模小，设备差和经费不足，不得不根据群众的需要，有重点的添购补充，在报纸方面第一订购本地区的报纸，第二订购外埠的工商报，供工商业者参读。第三订购附近地区的报纸，因为和本市人民关系密切，市民比较关心。在图书方面，以当前需要为主，留作参考者次之。目前市民学生最喜欢借阅者是文艺小说，文化高的工人和工程师等，需要工业科学书籍，商人需要政策类的小册子，职员干部则以政治文艺两类为多，现在最缺乏的是工业及自然科学书籍，因此满足不了工程技师工厂管理人员和一部分工人的要求，这是急宜设法购置的。
    本市过去没有图书馆的设置，根据解放后将近一年来的事实证明，为满足群众日益广大的读书要求，花一定力量，筹办一定规模的图书馆实属必要。
    　　　　二、展览工作
    根据过去所举行的展览，大致可分为馆内经常的展览，馆外的流动展览，及临时组织的实物展览三种，前两者主要是漫画、照片及其他美术作品，次要图表文字（如墙报）等，后者主要是工业品，次为其他实物（如庆祝华北人民政府成立的贺幢贺匾及胜利品等）展览的组织主要依靠自己举办，也有联合其他机关共同举办，和受人委托举办的，在展览的内容和方针上，一般的都是配合中心工作，纪念节日及形势发展，有一定的中心，有目的有计划，进行时事政治与政策宣传，如每个大的纪念节日，都举行了有关该节日的有教育意义的展览，配合发展工商业的任务，举行工业成品展览；配合国民党人员登记，举行国民党罪行及失足分子坦白自新等各种故事画展览；配合时事教育举行刘邓大军南渡黄河，临汾、晋中大胜利展览，配合庆祝华北人民政府成立，举行华北临代大会照片及贺幢贺匾及其他有关材料的展览等，在展览的方式上总馆分馆的展览室是经常固定的。馆外的流动展览，分街头画报，集市与街头展览和利用机关学校部队，工余课余的小型展览等。实物展览主要是工业品，多系与工商部门合办，有的是综合性的展览，有的则是比较专门性的。在展览当中，为取得更好的宣传教育效果，必须组织专人进行指导和讲解，事实证明，指导解释做的好不好与展览的效果很有关系。
    将近一年来馆内展览室换过十几次新的内容，街头画报出过十四期，集中街头展览三十次，工厂学校部队展览十二次，工业品展览四次，每次展览都是观众拥挤；据馆内展览室的统计；去年十二月二十日，八个钟头的统计为七百六十人，“五一”“七一”两大节日，都在三千八百人以上，八月十七日为二千三百六十人，在飞机扰乱时，每天还有六七百人；三八节街头画报展览的统计，观众为一千一百余人，三次工业品展览，观众合计将近三万人。
    事实说明，这是最受群众欢迎的一种宣传教育方式，特别是在城市人口集中，更为适合，因而他的效果也是比较大的，随便听取一下群众参观展览时的反映即可证明，如在三八节东里村一个妇女参观妇女生产照片和白毛女连环画，对民教馆干部说：“以前说你们这长那短，净是瞎胡说哩，如今娘儿们一个人在什么地方走，也不怕出事了。”不少的人看了刘邓大军南征照片说：“打过黄河我总不大相信，如今看到军队到了大别山，这回错不了啦！”
