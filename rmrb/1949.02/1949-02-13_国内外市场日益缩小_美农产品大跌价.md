Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 11th – Due to the shrinking of domestic and foreign markets, the wholesale prices of U.S. agricultural products and some daily consumer goods, as well as stock prices, have plummeted since the 4th. According to a TASS dispatch from New York: In Chicago (the U.S. agricultural product trading center), corn fell by 5.5 to 7.75 cents per bushel (approximately 3.4 *dou* in our units) on the 4th, and continued to fall by 2 to 3 cents on the 7th. Wheat fell by more than 3 cents on the 4th, and another 2.5 cents on the 7th. Cotton in New York fell by $1.25 per bale (500 pounds) on the 4th, and continued to fall by $1.20 to $1.85 on the 7th. On the 7th, wool, rubber, and other items such as pork, beef, and lard also fell in price. The Associated Press's index of 35 commodity prices (with 1926 as 100) has fallen to its lowest point in the past two years, down more than 2 points from last week, and down more than 26 points since February of last year (based on 186.3 on February 13th of last year). On the 4th, some stock prices in New York fell by $5 per share, and on the 7th, many large companies' stocks continued to fall, some by $4 per share. According to the New York Times, following the production cuts in the cotton and wool textiles, shoemaking and sock-making, rubber, glass, truck, radio, and electric refrigerator industries, the hardware manufacturing industry in many industrial centers has also reduced production by 5% to 15%. Moreover, in some areas, this reduction in production has reached a dangerous level.

U.S. agricultural product prices have fluctuated since their sharp drop in February of last year. Although they rebounded somewhat from April to July, they never returned to their original levels, and since August, retail prices of agricultural products have slowly and continuously declined. This downward trend has intensified sharply since the 4th of this month. According to an Associated Press dispatch from New York on the 5th: "Although this year's price drop is slower than last year's, it is becoming increasingly severe and is being closely watched by all business leaders as a clue to future developments." Regarding this drop in agricultural product prices, The New York Times had to admit that it "is mostly attributed to the large supply of agricultural products and the contraction of the capitalist market."

In the United States, falling prices are by no means a blessing for the industrial masses. Because this decline is itself a sign of the impoverishment of the working class and peasantry, and the result of falling prices and reduced production is bound to be accompanied by a larger number of workers being thrown into the streets. U.S. officials admit that the number of unemployed in January has soared by 700,000 (based on an existing 2 million), and this does not include a large number of underemployed. Now, "the increasing unemployment has made the capitalist newspapers uneasy" (Electric News Agency dispatch from New York on the 7th).

### 国内外市场日益缩小　美农产品大跌价

　　国内外市场日益缩小
  　美农产品大跌价
    【新华社陕北十一日电】由于国内外市场的日益缩小，美国农产品、一部分日用消费品的批发价格及股票的价格于四日起发生急剧的下跌。据塔斯社纽约消息称：芝加哥（美国农产品交易中心）的玉黍蜀四日每蒲式耳（约合我国三斗四升）跌了五分五厘至七分七厘五，七日续跌二分至三分。四日小麦跌了三分多，七日又跌了二分五厘。四日纽约棉花每包（五百磅）跌了一元二角五分，七日续跌一元二角至一元八角五分。而七日羊毛、橡皮及其他各物如猪、牛肉及猪油等也都跌了价。美联社的三十五种商品价格指数（以一九二六年为一百）已跌至过去两年中的最低点，比上周跌了二点多，从去年二月以来（按去年二月十三日为一八六·三），迄今已跌了二十六点以上。纽约某些股票价格，四日每股跌了五元，七日许多大公司的股票续跌，有的每股跌了四元。据纽约时报透露，继棉、毛纺织品、制鞋制袜、橡皮、玻璃、卡车、收音机、电气冰箱各业的减产之后，又有许多工业中心的五金制造工业也已减产百分之五至十五。而且有些地区的这种减产，已达到危险的程度。
    美国农产品自去年二月暴跌以后，即已波动不已。四月至七月虽一度回涨，但始终未能回复到原来的水平，而自八月起，农产品零售价格又连续慢慢下跌。这种下跌得趋势自本月四日起骤形加剧。据美联社纽约五日电称：“虽然今年的跌价是比去年来的缓慢了些，但是愈来愈厉害，而且正被所有企业界领袖当作未来发展的线索而密切的注视着。”对于这次农产品的跌价，纽约时报也不得不承认是“大部分归因于农产品的大量供给和资本家的市场收缩。
    在美国，物价的下跌绝不是工业大众的福音。因为这种下跌本身就是工农大众穷困化的标志，而物价下跌与生产缩减的结果，势必伴以更大量工人的被抛到街头。美国官方承认，一月份的失业人数已猛增了七十万人（按原有二百万人），而大量的半失业者尚不包括在内。现在，“失业的日益增加，已使资本家的报纸心神不安了”（电通社纽约七日电）。
