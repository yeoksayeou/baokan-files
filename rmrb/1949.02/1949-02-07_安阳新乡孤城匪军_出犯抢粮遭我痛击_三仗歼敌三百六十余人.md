[Taihang Telegram] The Chiang bandit troops besieged in the isolated city of Anyang, venturing out to loot grain, have been met with fierce counterattacks from our local armed forces, resulting in the annihilation of over 360 enemies in three battles. On the 7th of last month, the puppet Cixian County Security Regiment and Supervisory Battalion stationed in Anyang City, totaling more than 500 men, invaded our Wang'an Village. After learning of this, a certain unit of the Fifth Military Sub-district's local corps rushed from its garrison after a 40-li forced march, arriving at the area between Honghetun and Liangmagang at 4:00 AM on the 18th to intercept the enemy. After four hours of combat, half of the enemy was annihilated, killing and wounding 114 enemy personnel including the enemy Deputy Regiment Commander Wang Liuan (killed), and capturing two enemy company commanders and 119 bandit soldiers. Our Yexian County Regiment also advanced to Gaizindian, east of Anyang, at 5:00 AM on the 20th to lay an ambush. At 6:30 AM, the enemy's Second Supervisory Battalion's 5th and 6th companies and the Gaizindian Township Office, totaling about 100 men, entered our ambush circle, and we immediately surrounded and attacked them. After 15 minutes of fierce fighting, 15 enemy personnel including the enemy 6th Company Commander Wang Lu (killed) were killed or wounded, and 77 enemy personnel including the enemy 5th Company Commander Wang Jinsheng were captured alive. We suffered no casualties. On the same day, more than 200 men from the enemy's Third Supervisory Battalion stationed in Anyang invaded our Daxiao Po area to the west but were repelled by our Anyang Regiment, resulting in the capture alive of 33 enemy personnel including a platoon leader, with no casualties on our side. In the aforementioned three battles, a total of 14 light machine guns, 213 rifles and pistols, more than 11,180 rounds of ammunition, and 98 bombs were seized.
    [Another dispatch] On the 19th, about 500 men from the enemy's First Regiment of the First Security Brigade stationed in Xinxiang invaded Niangniangmiao and Zhangwudian areas west of Ji (County) to loot grain, and were bravely and fiercely attacked by a part of the Fifth Military Sub-district's local corps, killing, wounding, and capturing 12 enemy soldiers, and seizing 2 rifles and nearly 200 rounds of ammunition. At 2:00 AM on the 20th, the enemy's 115th and 317th Regiments' Engineer Artillery Battalion, the bandit Wang Sanzhu's regiment, and a cavalry company invaded Tianzhuang, Shuanglai, Daxiao Kema, and the northeast mountainous area to loot grain. Our Tangyin Independent Battalion fought the enemy at Litun from 7:00 AM to 11:00 AM, repelling the enemy and killing, wounding, and capturing more than 10 enemy soldiers.
