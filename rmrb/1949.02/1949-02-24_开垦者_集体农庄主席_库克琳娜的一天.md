　　"A Day in the Life of Kuklina, Chairman of the 'Cultivator' Collective Farm"
    By Skurixin, Translated by Yuan Yuan

    Kuklina's daily labor begins at dawn. As day breaks, she tiptoes out of the house so as not to wake the children. First, she inspects the farm, and then goes to the flax fields. The flax is thriving along the Luchi River, growing like a green carpet. Kuklina bends down to look at the seedlings. She walks around the flax field, then marks off a small square meter and patiently counts the number of flax plants growing there: two thousand eight hundred and sixty. The flax is growing very well. But she thinks, "Don't get too excited too soon." Weeds have already grown in some places, and hard work will be needed before the harvest. Besides weeding, there may be other visitors—hungry insects, droughts, anything can happen, and we must be prepared for it. Today, the flax growers promised Stalin a bumper harvest. No wonder Kuklina is concerned about every brave little sprout that pokes its head out of the ground and bathes in the sunlight. She writes in her notebook: "Tell the team leaders to start weeding tomorrow." Then, she goes back home. At breakfast, her daughter says, "Mom, a guest wants to see you." Kuklina receives many guests every day, collective farm members from near and far. She is a member of the Collective Farm Committee of the USSR Council of Ministers, a representative of the Supreme Soviet of the Russian Soviet Federative Socialist Republic, and a flax grower. A tall old man is politely knocking on the door with a gnarled cane. Kuklina invites him in and pours him a cup of tea. The guest's name is Ivanovich. He pulls up a chair and sits down, straight and dignified. Like all conversations, they start with the weather. The guest asks about the young flax and the prospects for the harvest. He finishes his tea before getting to the point. He has been sent by two collective farms forty-five miles away. The management of one of the farms is generally incompetent. They are violating the rules of the collective farm, allowing some members to have large private vegetable gardens and illegally reducing the allocation for other members. He wants Kuklina, as a member of the collective farm committee, to help him correct this situation. The other collective farm asks her to help them get new trucks. After Kuklina reads the letters brought by the old man, she writes on the corner: "Take this to Moscow." She will be going to the capital in a few days to attend the Supreme Soviet meeting. She promises to do her best to help Ivanovich solve these two problems. After breakfast, Kuklina goes to the new hydroelectric power station under construction. The scene by the river is very lively, with everyone working hard. The house for installing the 45-kilowatt generator has been built. Now they must rush to complete the sluice gate. The people working here are from three farms—“Cultivator” (Kuklina is the chairman), "Red Flag" and "Kaganovich." It is calculated that by mid-August, all three farms will have electricity. Electricity will not only illuminate their houses, but also pump water and thresh grain for them. The iron frames supporting the high-voltage power lines extend in all directions from the station, and the lines are all installed. Carpenters are building a small house, which will serve as a telephone exchange and radio relay station. Kuklina and the engineer inspect the site. Tomorrow, she will send more manpower she can spare to the sluice gate. One truck can be used exclusively to transport building timber. Another will go to Saranga (the district center) to load gasoline. The sun is high, shining on the fertile land. The earth has just shaken off the cold of the night. It is time to go to the collective farm office. There, too, work is piled up. An agronomist from the district is waiting. He has come to check the preliminary results of the competition between Kuklina and the famous flax growers of Kirov Province. Kuklina asks him to go to the fields first: "Go and see for yourself first, and then we can talk." The second person to see her is a bricklayer. He is responsible for building a brick kiln in the area and making it produce. This is one of the tasks that the locality should carry out in the current five-year plan. The brick and tile industry should be developed more widely in the countryside. The collective farm members themselves are very interested in this. They want to live in solid, durable houses forever. At lunchtime, some collective farm members come to the office. Everyone has something to discuss with Kuklina—personal or general. She meets with them separately, always handling the issues they raise with gentleness and calmness. The sun's flames gradually weaken, and dusk falls on the boundless fields, the centuries-old birch trees, and the linden trees. The village is quiet and peaceful. In the distance, the songs of some village girls, accompanied by the melody of an accordion, can be heard clearly. Kuklina still has a lot of work to do at home. Her desk is piled with books and papers. She looks through all the letters. These letters come not only from neighboring villages, but also from all over the country. There is a letter from the chairman of the "New Life" collective farm in the Tatarov District of the Voroshilov Province of Ukraine. The chairman writes that his members have decided to start growing flax, starting with two hectares. The chairman asks Kuklina to give them some advice in this regard. And he asks her if she can tell him how she achieves such good harvests? This question makes her think. How did she learn to grow flax? Had she overcome so many difficulties and obstacles? In 1936, she decided to organize the first flax-growing group in the farm. Her initial goal was to grow five hectares—with a yield of eleven centners per hectare. This was unheard of at the time. Before that, a yield of fifty or sixty kilograms of flax per hectare was considered a good harvest. Kuklina and her companions who participated in this undertaking first made a thorough study of flax cultivation methods, consulted with the district agronomists, and worked very hard. When there was a drought, they carried water to irrigate. Sometimes they did not go home for many days. As a result, they harvested 10.6 centners of flax per hectare. The harvest was even better the following year. Part of the land yielded 19.2 centners per hectare, and the average yield for the rest was 16.5 centners per hectare. They increased the yield of flax year after year, and the collective farm's income also increased accordingly.
    The farm has six flax groups, and the team leaders are all Kuklina's former assistants. In 1939, the "Cultivator" farm was awarded the "Order of Glory" for its superior harvest record. When the war just began, the members elected Kuklina as chairman. She, like her deceased husband—who was also the chairman of the farm—proved herself worthy of the job. During the most difficult years of the war, the "Cultivator" farm not only did not decline, but actually improved. It was often the leading farm in the area... After Kuklina reads the letter from the Tatarov District again, she writes a reply. She takes three books from the bookshelf: "How I Grow 17.2 Centners of Flax per Hectare," "How to Achieve a Bumper Harvest of Long-Fiber Flax," and "My Experience as Chairman of a Collective Farm." These are all written by Kuklina herself. She puts the books in a large envelope. She writes: "Perhaps my experience will help you grow excellent flax." Kuklina turns off the light. By this time, the pleasant, warm summer night has long descended upon the slumbering village.

　　“开垦者”集体农庄主席
  　库克琳娜的一天
    斯库里新作  圆圆译
    库克琳娜每天的劳动由清晨开始。天方黎明，她蹑手蹑脚地走出屋子。这样不致惊醒了孩子们。她首先巡视庄园，然后再到亚麻地。亚麻正欣欣向荣的沿着鲁奇河生长着，象一条绿色的大地毡。库克琳娜俯身在看这些嫩苗，她绕着亚麻地看一周，然后划出一平方公尺的小块，耐心地查数这上面长出亚麻的株数，有二千八百六十株。亚麻长得很好。但是她想：“亲爱的，别乐得太早啊。”有的地方已长了害草，在收割前还得下一番苦功。而且除出草以外，也许还有别的探访者——馋虫子，旱灾，什么事都可能发生的、必须有这样的准备。今天种亚麻的答应了斯大林一个丰年。怪不得库克琳娜很关切每棵突出地面、沐浴于阳光中的英勇小芽。她在小本子上记下：“告诉队长们，明天开始耨草”。然后，她才转回家里。早饭时，她的女孩子说：“妈妈，一位客人要见你。”库克琳娜每天都接见很多客人，远近的集体农庄庄员。她是苏联部长会议集体农庄委员会的委员，俄罗斯苏维埃联邦共和国最高苏维埃的代表，亚麻种植者。一个高个的老人正用一根多节拐杖很有礼貌的在敲门。库克琳娜请他进来，斟上一杯茶。客人的名字叫伊凡诺维奇。他拉开椅子坐下来，坐得笔直庄重。和所有的谈话一样，先从天气谈起。客人问了问嫩亚麻的情况和收成的远景。他把茶喝完以后才转到本题上。他是由四十五里外的两个集体农庄推举来的。其中一个农庄的管理部全是一般无能之辈，他们正违犯集体农庄的规则，允许一些庄员拥有很多的个人菜园，非法减少了其他庄员的分配额。他让集体农庄委员之一的库克琳娜帮他纠正这种现象。另一个集体农庄要求她设法给他们获得新卡车。库克琳娜把老人带来的信读过后，在角上写下：“把这个带到莫斯科”。几天后她将到首都去出席最高苏维埃会议。她答应尽力帮助伊凡诺维奇解决这两个问题。早饭后，库克琳娜到正在建筑中的新水力发电站去。河边的景象非常热闹，每个人都在埋头苦干。安装四十五千瓦发电机的房子已经盖好。现在必须突击一下把水闸完成。在这里工作的人是来自三个农庄的——“开垦者”（库克琳娜是主席），“红旗”和“卡冈诺维奇”。计算到八月中旬，三个农庄都可以使用上电力，电将不仅是照耀着他们的房屋，而且替他们抽水、打谷。支持高压电线的铁架的电站向四面八方伸展，而且都装上了线。木匠正在盖造一座小房子，将作电话交换台和无线电转播处。库克琳娜和工程师一起巡视一周。明天她将增派她的能抽调的人手到水闸上。一辆货车可以专用来运送建筑用的木料。另一辆到萨兰加（区中心）去装汽油。太阳已经很高的晒着丰饶的大地。大地现在才摆脱了彻夜的寒冷。是到集体农庄的办公室去的时候了。那儿也堆满了工作。区上的一位农艺专家在等着，他是来检查库克琳娜和基洛夫省的著名亚麻种植者的竞赛初步结果。库克琳娜让他到地里去：“你自己先去看一看，然后我们才能谈。”第二个见她的是一个砖瓦匠。他负责在这个地区建起一座砖窑，并使它生产。这是现在的五年计划中地方上应该执行的一种，砖瓦业应在乡村中更广泛地开展。集体农庄庄民自己对这方面就很感兴趣。他们要住在结实耐久的房子里一直到永远。午饭时，一些集体农庄庄员到办公室来。每人都有事和库克琳娜商量——个人的，或是一般的。她分头接见，对于他们提出的问题，总是和悦稳静的处理着。太阳的火焰渐微弱，黄昏降临在无垠的田野、百年的老桦树和菩提树上，村子里一片青寂。远处，一些村子里的姑娘的歌声，伴奏的手风琴的旋律清晰可闻。库克琳娜在家里仍然有许多工作，她的桌子上堆满了书和纸。她把所有的来信看一遍。这些信不仅来自邻近的村庄，而且来自全国各地，有一封是从乌克兰的沃罗希洛夫省来的。塔塔乌罗夫区“新生活”集体农庄主席在信上说，他的庄员们决定着手种亚麻，先种两公顷，主席请库克琳娜在这方面给他们提一些意见。并且问她能否告诉他，她怎样获得这样好的收成？这个问题使她思索起来。她怎样学会种亚麻？难道经过这样多的困难和障碍。是在一九三六年她决定在农庄里组织第一个种亚麻小组，她最初的目标是种五公顷——产量每公顷是十一生丁纳。这是后来没听见过的。在那以前一公顷麻的产量能到五十或六十公斤已经算是好收成了。库克琳娜和参加这一事业的同伴们先就亚麻种植法来一番彻底的研究和区的农艺专家商量，而且下了很大的一番苦功。当天旱时，她们挑水灌溉。有时好多天不回家。结果她们在每公顷收了一○·六生丁纳的麻。第二年的收成更好。一部分地里每公顷收了一九·二生丁纳，其他部分每公顷的平均产量是十六·五生丁纳。她们年复一年地增加亚麻的产量，而集体农庄的收入也随之增加。
    这农庄有六个亚麻组，组长都是库克琳娜昔日的助手。一九三九年，“开垦者”农庄因为有优越的收成纪录荣获“光荣奖章”。战争刚开始，庄员们就选库克琳娜当主席。她跟她死去的丈夫一样——他也曾是农庄的主席——证明了她自己担当得起这个工作。在最困难的战争岁月里，“开垦者”农庄不但丝毫没有衰退，反而实际上有了改进。它常是本区内占第一位的农庄。……库克琳娜把塔塔乌罗夫区的来信再看一遍之后，写了一封回信。从书架上拿下三本书：“我怎样每公顷种出一七·二生丁纳的亚麻”，“如何达到长纤维亚麻的丰收”，“我底集体农庄主席的经验”。这都是库克琳娜自己写的。她把书放进大信封里。写上：“也许我的经验会帮助你们种出优良的亚麻。”库克琳娜熄了灯。这时，愉悦暖和的夏夜降临在这个酣睡的村庄已经多时了。
