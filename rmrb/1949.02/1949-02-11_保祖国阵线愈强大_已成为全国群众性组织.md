Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 9th: Sofia Dispatch: The Bulgarian Fatherland Front has been reorganized into a single mass organization since the Second Congress of Representatives on February 3rd of last year, and a year has now passed. According to the charter of the Fatherland Front, anyone who acknowledges the charter and program of the Fatherland Front and participates in the work of the Front's organizations at all levels, regardless of party affiliation, religion, or social status, may become a member of the Fatherland Front. Therefore, members of various parties participate in an individual capacity, while mass organizations such as trade unions participate as groups. The Fatherland Front now has one million individual members, and group members include the General Trade Union, the People's Youth League, the Women's Association, the Anti-Fascist Veterans League, and the Artists' League. The Executive Committee of the Bulgarian Radical Social Party decided in early February that the party would no longer continue to exist independently and decided to merge into the Fatherland Front. This decision will be discussed by party members in eight cities from February 20th to 27th. The Fatherland Front has become one of the largest mass organizations in Bulgaria. In the year since its reorganization, the Fatherland Front has done a great deal in educating its members and the broad masses on domestic and foreign policy issues; it has also done much in mobilizing the masses and building Bulgaria's socialist foundation. The Fatherland Front has established approximately 6,500 cultural and labor teams throughout Bulgaria, which have been conducting educational work and engaging in national construction projects, saving the country 137 million leva in wages.
　　Due to the lack of vigilance of some members, some anti-democratic elements have infiltrated the organization. Since the beginning of February, the Executive Committee of the Fatherland Front has begun reviewing its members. Careful rectification work is underway in various districts of Sofia, and this work will soon be extended to the entire country. The purpose of the rectification is to purge former Fascist police who committed persecution crimes and who are still trying to conceal their past crimes by constantly changing addresses.

　　保祖国阵线愈强大
  　已成为全国群众性组织
    【新华社陕北九日电】索非亚讯：保加利亚祖国阵线自去年二月三日第二届代表大会决定改组为单一的群众性机构以来，至今已有一年。根据祖国阵线的章程，凡承认祖国阵线的章程与纲领，并参加祖国阵线的各级机构工作者，不分党派、宗教或社会地位，均得为祖国阵线的成员。所以，各党派党员是以个人身份参加的，职工会等群众团体则以团体为单位参加。祖国阵线现在已拥有个人会员一百万，团体会员则有总工会、人民青年联盟、妇女协会、反法西斯退伍军人联盟、艺术家联盟等。保加利亚急进社会党执委会于二月初决定，该党不再继续独立存在，决定并入祖国阵线。该决定将于二月二十日至二十七日在八个城市由该党党员会议讨论。祖国阵线业已成为保加利亚最大的群众性组织之一。祖国阵线在它改组后的一年中间，在对自己的成员与广大群众进行内政外交政策问题的教育方面作了很多事情；在发动群众、建设保加利亚社会主义基础方面，也作了许多事情。祖国阵线在保国各地成立了约六千五百个文化与劳动队，这些工作队一直在进行教育工作并从事国家的建设工程，为国家节省了一亿三千七百万保币的工资。
    由于某些成员的不警惕，一些反民主分子已潜入了组织。自二月初以来，祖国阵线执委会业已开始审查它的成员。索非亚各区正在进行小心翼翼的整顿工作，这一工作即将普遍到全国各地。整顿的目的，在于清除犯有迫害罪的前法西斯警察，他们至今仍以不断改变地址的办法，企图隐瞒他们过去的犯罪行为。
