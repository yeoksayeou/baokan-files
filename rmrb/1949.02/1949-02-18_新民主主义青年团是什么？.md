　　What is the New Democratic Youth League?
　　Feng Wenbin
　　The birth and development of the Chinese New Democratic Youth League has epoch-making significance in the history of the Chinese youth movement. Because of having its own core organization—the Youth League—youths can more easily realize their demands for learning and progress, more easily and in a more organized way seek benefits for themselves and the working people, and can better and more greatly play an active role in the People's Liberation War and the various construction undertakings of the People's Democratic Republic; the revolution has increased a vital force, and the Party has gained a reliable reserve force and assistant.
　　The New Democratic Youth League is different from both the Communist Youth League of the Ten-Year Civil War period (especially the later period) and the Youth National Salvation Association of the Anti-Japanese War period, as well as general student associations, youth drama troupes, and other organizations. The Communist Youth League played a great role in the history of the Chinese revolution, but it also had serious shortcomings of closed-doorism and vanguardism, which hindered its connection with the broad masses of youth. The Youth National Salvation Association of the Anti-Japanese War also made considerable contributions to the Anti-Japanese War, but its fundamental weakness was the lack of a core, therefore it was loose and lacked persistence. Different from these two kinds of organizations, the New Democratic Youth League does not restrict the composition of its members with communist standards, but it is not an organization that all youth can join, but is limited to absorbing advanced youth activists among the youth.
　　The task of the New Democratic Youth League is, through the members and the League organization, with its own exemplary actions and persistent work, to unite and educate the entire generation of youth, and together with the people of the whole country, actively participate in the People's Liberation War and the construction work of New Democracy. Past experience has proven that this kind of core organization is necessary, because without such an advanced youth activist organization as the core of the youth masses, it is not only impossible to better exert the active role of the youth, but also impossible to achieve the goal of uniting and educating the youth masses. But if the Youth League is arrogant and complacent, and does not unite and educate the broad masses of youth, creating narrow closed-doorism and sectarianism, that is the greatest danger of the Youth League, and it must use the spirit of Marxism-Leninism to constantly educate its members to prevent and overcome the occurrence of this kind of thinking.
　　The New Democratic Youth League should strive for the complete victory of New Democracy; that is, to completely overthrow the rule of imperialism, feudalism, and bureaucratic capitalism in China; to strive for the construction of the New Democratic People's Republic of China; to strive for the liberation of youth, the liberation of the people, and the liberation of all mankind. In order to achieve these goals, the New Democratic Youth League should not be led by the bourgeoisie or the petty bourgeoisie, but must be led by the vanguard of the proletariat—the Communist Party. Of course, the League is a non-Party mass organization, and should completely maintain its own independent system in organization, but this does not mean that it can do without the leadership of the Communist Party, it can reject the leadership of the Party, it does not mean that the Party can abandon its leadership over it. If some members of the Youth League want to reject the leadership of the Communist Party to show their non-partisanship, it is undoubtedly a very big mistake. Because only the Communist Party is the party of the most advanced class in the world, is the party armed with the most revolutionary science in the world, is the party that represents the interests of the largest number of people and the largest number of youth in the world, is the most resolute and thorough revolutionary party, and only such a party can truly lead the advanced youth activist organization.
　　The Youth League should accept the political leadership of the Communist Party, this is one aspect; but on the other hand, the Youth League should not regard belief in communism or proficiency in the theory of New Democracy as a condition for joining the League. Some areas stipulate that only those who meet the conditions of probationary party members of the Communist Party can be admitted to the League, which is wrong. This is confusing the mass organization led by the Party with the Party itself. As long as they acknowledge the League's constitution, support the Communist Party's propositions, and are willing to actively strive for the cause of New Democracy and serve the working people faithfully, young men and women can be admitted to the League; although many of them do not yet have a clear understanding of New Democracy, they can solve this problem in their studies after joining the League. The Youth League must not allow elements who oppose New Democracy or believe in fascism to join the League in order to maintain the necessary ideological purity of the League. At the same time, systematic education in Marxism-Leninism should be conducted among the members, so that each member can gradually understand the basic viewpoints of Marxism-Leninism and gradually improve their political theory and cultural level. The admission and withdrawal of members of the League should fully implement the principles of voluntariness and freedom. The life within the League should be democratic and lively, but it must be based on democratic centralism, with order and consciously observed discipline.
　　The composition of Youth League members should not be limited to proletarian youth. It should be based on working-class youth and revolutionary intellectual youth. Some places only stipulate that it should be based on poor and lower-middle peasant youth, which is incomplete, but in some places, taking the components of landlords and rich peasants as the basis for building the League is even more wrong. Although the Youth League can absorb progressive youth from other social components and other parties and organizations, it must be conditional and limited in order to maintain the necessary organizational purity of the League. The absorption of members should go through the procedures of application and introduction, individual review, branch approval, and higher-level approval. The Youth League should not become a federation of youth organizations. Every male and female member of the Youth League must truly be an advanced youth activist among the young men and women, and forced joining, indiscriminate recruitment, and various simple errors in pursuing numbers must be prevented.
　　The Chinese New Democratic Youth League was established according to the needs of the broad masses of youth. The Youth League should be made a strong force, the true core of Chinese youth, so as to unite millions of youth, and under the banner of Mao Zedong, bravely strive for the complete victory of New Democracy, and strive for the complete liberation of China and the complete liberation of mankind.

　　新民主主义青年团是什么？
    冯文彬
    中国新民主主义青年团的诞生与发展，在中国青年运动史上有划时代的意义。由于有了自己的核心组织——青年团，青年就容易更好地实现学习和进步的要求了，就容易更有组织地为自己为劳动人民去谋利益了，就能够在人民解放战争中，和人民民主共和国的各种建设事业中，更好更多地发挥积极作用了，革命增加了一支生力军，党得到了一个可靠的后备军和助手。
    新民主主义青年团，既不同于十年内战时期（特别是后期）的共产主义青年团，也不同于抗日战争时期的青年救国会，以及一般性的学生会、青年剧团等组织。共产主义青年团，在中国革命历史上有过很大的作用，但也曾经有过严重的关门主义与先锋主义的弱点，妨碍了它同广大青年群众的联系，抗日战争时期的青年救国会，对于抗日战争也有不小的贡献，但它的根本弱点是缺乏核心，因此松懈而缺乏持久性。和这两种组织不同的新民主主义青年团，不以共产主义的标准来限制团员的成份，但又不是所有青年都可以加入的组织，而限于吸收青年中先进的青年积极分子。
    新民主主义青年团的任务，是经过团员和团的组织，以自己的模范行动，坚持不懈的工作，去团结和教育青年的整个一代，和全国人民一道，积极参加人民解放战争和新民主主义的建设工作。这种核心组织，以往的经验已经证明是必要的，因为如果没有这种先进青年积极分子组织，作为青年群众的核心，不仅不能更好发挥青年的积极作用，也不可能达到团结和教育青年群众的目的。但如果青年团骄傲自满，不去团结和教育广大青年群众，造成狭隘的关门主义和宗派主义，那是青年团最大的危险，必须以马克思列宁主义的精神，去经常教育团员，防止与克服这种思想的发生。
    新民主主义青年团应当为新民主主义的彻底胜利而奋斗；即是为彻底推翻帝国主义、封建主义与官僚资本主义在中国的统治；为建设新民主主义的中华人民民主共和国而奋斗；为解放青年，解放人民，解放全人类而奋斗。而为了达到这些目的，新民主主义青年团就不应由资产阶级或小资产阶级来领导，而必须由无产阶级的先锋队——共产党来领导。固然，团是非党的群众性的组织，在组织上应当完全保持自己的独立系统，但这完全不是说，它可以不需要共产党的领导，它可以拒绝党的领导，不是说党可以放弃对它的领导。如果青年团的团员中，有人想拒绝共产党的领导，以表示自己的非党派性，无疑是一个极大的错误。因为只有共产党才是全世界最先进阶级的党，才是全世界以革命的科学武装起来的党，才是代表全世界最大多数人民和最大多数青年利益的党，才是最坚决彻底革命的党，只有这样的党才能够真正领导先进的青年积极分子组织。
    青年团应当接受共产党的政治领导，这是一方面；但另一方面，青年团却不应当以信仰共产主义或精通新民主主义的理论，作为入团的条件，有些地区规定一定要够共产党候补党员条件的才吸收入团，这是不对的，这是把党所领导的群众团体和党本身混为一谈了。只要承认团章，拥护共产党的主张，愿为新民主主义事业积极奋斗，愿为劳动人民忠诚服务的男女青年，均可吸收入团；虽然他们中间的许多人对新民主主义的认识还不明确透澈，但他们可以在入团以后的学习中解决这个问题。青年团必须不允许反对新民主主义或信仰法西斯主义的分子入团，以保持团在思想上必要的纯洁性。同时，应当在团员中有系统地进行马克思列宁主义的教育，使每个团员能够逐渐领会马克思列宁主义的基本观点，逐渐提高自己的政治理论和文化水平。团员的入团退团应当完全实行自愿自由的原则。团内的生活应当是民主的活泼的，但必须是在民主集中制的基础之上，有秩序和有自觉遵守的纪律。
    青年团员的成份，不应只限于无产阶级的青年。应当以工农劳动青年和革命知识青年为基础。有些地方仅仅规定以贫雇农青年为基础是不完全的，但有些地方，把地主富农成份作为建团的基础更是不对的。青年团虽然可以吸收其他社会成份和其他党派社团中的进步青年入团，但必须是有条件和有限制的，以保持团在组织上必要的纯洁性。吸收团员应当经过申请介绍，个别审查，支部通过，上级批准的手续。青年团不应成为青年团体联合会。青年团中的每个男女团员，都应当真正是男女青年群众中的先进的青年积极分子，必须防止强迫加入，滥收和各种简单追求数字的错误作法。
    中国新民主主义青年团是根据广大青年需求建立起来的。应当使青年团成为一支强大的队伍，成为中国青年的真正核心，以便团结千百万青年，在毛泽东的旗帜下，勇敢地去争取新民主主义的彻底胜利，争取全中国和全人类的彻底解放。
