To the Editor:
    Now that the war in our North China region is gradually shifting to the outer lines, most areas, except for a very few enemy-occupied strongholds, are in a relatively stable environment. Therefore, farmers' support for war service has decreased by more than half compared to before. Why does the government still explicitly stipulate that workers must contribute a fixed amount of war service rice every month? Furthermore, after the implementation of the new wage system for workers, the wages of apprentices, trainees, and even low-level workers are only enough to maintain their daily lives, and apprentices still need financial support from their families for clothing and other expenses. How should the issue of war service rice for these people be resolved? Please publish a response in the newspaper.

To the Editor:
    In the factory where workers work, almost fifty percent do not get their tax exemption points deducted. The village doesn't count the number of people, but about fifty percent do have their tax exemption points deducted. Some are even treated as military dependents, and some are even provided with substitute farming. Not only is it inconsistent from county to county, but it is also inconsistent from district to district. When I asked the superiors, they said there were no specific regulations. I think the government should treat everyone the same for the same work and cannot be inconsistent. Even if it depends on the family's living situation, the individual's tax exemption point should be deducted. The village just says that the workers in the factory are earning several hundred kilograms of millet, and the family is not counting the number of people. Workers are doing revolutionary work, not something bad, so why are they treated this way? I am raising this issue not for myself but for a small number of workers. I hope there will be specific regulations from the superiors, and revolutionary workers should be treated equally. I hope the government will give a detailed response in the newspaper.

To the Editor:
    The implementation of family treatment for workers and treatment for workers at home varies from place to place, affecting production morale. Based on our understanding of the situation, we raise the following questions: (1) Should workers' families be treated differently from military dependents due to the implementation of the wage system? However, can workers in military factories obtain military dependent status and enjoy the political treatment of military dependents? (2) Can military factory workers receive substitute farming due to the low wartime wage standards and labor shortages? (3) Should military factory workers be counted in the agricultural tax and war service substitute farming calculations? Can they be exempted from their own war service and not provide substitute farming for others? (4) How are the regulations for workers paying income tax on their wages? Should they still contribute war service rice? If so, what are the specific regulations? (5) What should be the difference in treatment between military factory workers and non-military factory workers at the local level? These are common difficulties we encounter in our work. We suggest that the government promptly establish unified regulations. If there are unified regulations, we hope to notify the local governments to implement them uniformly to correct the inconsistent treatment and avoid affecting the morale of workers.
　　　　　　　　　　　Fifth Detachment 272
    Answer: Regarding the questions raised by Fifth Detachment 272 of the Enterprise Department and Comrade Zhang Shirong, as well as the Xinhua Paper Mill in Taiyue Duanshi, concerning the issues of family substitute farming for workers, war service contribution, and the deduction of tax exemption points for population calculation in agricultural tax, according to the war service regulations promulgated by the North China People's Government, the provisions for workers' war service burden and tax payment are as follows: all employees and shop assistants of state-owned factories, mines, workshops, and stores under the supply system are exempt from service, counted as population at home, and have their tax exemption points deducted. If they are revolutionary soldiers who have been transferred to work in state-owned military factories, their revolutionary military status remains, their families are still treated as military dependents, and if there is no labor at home, they can enjoy substitute farming. Other workers and shop assistants are treated as government and civilian personnel, and if there is no labor at home and their lives are truly difficult, a portion of land can be substitute-farmed by the village with the approval of the district. If they are employees and shop assistants of state-managed factories and stores under the salary system, and employees of privately and cooperatively operated factories and stores, they must all perform service. However, to take care of the production of factories and stores, it is now uniformly stipulated that they can pay war service rice instead of providing labor. Workers pay five kilograms of war service rice per person per month, and merchants pay ten kilograms per person per month. After deducting 120 kilograms of millet for their personal tax exemption point from their salary and wage income (30 kilograms for those who eat in the factory or store), the remaining amount is taxed at a rate of 10% to 12.5% according to the salary and wage income tax. Military factory workers are taxed at half the rate. Because workers and shop assistants are already counted as population in the factory and have their tax exemption points deducted, they are no longer counted as population and have their tax exemption points deducted for agricultural tax. After workers and shop assistants have paid war service rice and salary and wage income tax, they are no longer responsible for other services (including village service substitute farming) or other taxes. Regarding the questions raised by Fifth Detachment 272 and Comrade Zhang Shirong, we believe that:
    (1) Military factory workers who worked in the army in the past and are now transferred to military factories as workers are doing great work for military industrial production, ensuring the supply of military supplies to the front lines. Their families should still have the glorious title of revolutionary military dependents and enjoy the political treatment of revolutionary military dependents. However, since they have implemented the salary system, they should no longer have the village provide substitute farming. In terms of agricultural tax, since the salary tax has already deducted the tax exemption point, they should no longer be counted as a burden on the family and have the tax exemption point deducted. In terms of service, they may not directly provide service, which is partly to ensure work, but supporting the front lines is an obligation that everyone should fulfill. Military factory workers should reduce their war service rice contribution to five kilograms per person per month to support the front lines (farmers contribute at least an average of 10 to 20 kilograms per month). Salary and wage income tax should be levied at half the rate according to regulations. General workers are not reduced.
    (2) The current wartime wage standard is indeed not high, but based on the general income, workers' salary income is still several times higher than that of farmers. On average, farmers have to pay burdens, and workers should also pay income tax.

### 关于工人负担的几个问题

1949-02-06

专栏：询问与答复

　　关于工人负担的几个问题编辑同志：
    现在咱华北区战争日渐转移外线，除极少数敌占居点外，大都处于相对安定的环境，因此农民支援战勤已较前减少了大半。为什么对于工人，政府却明文规定每月要出固定勤米呢？同时工人实行了新的工资制度之后，对学徒、见习，甚而至于低级工人的工资，仅能维持自己日常生活，学徒穿用，还得由家庭补助。这些人勤米又应如何解决？请在报上登载答复。
  　　　　　　　　　　太岳端氏新华造纸厂职工会编辑同志：
    工人在厂工作，差不多占百分之五十的不刨免税点，村里不算人数，但也有约百分之五十的就刨了免税点，而有的还按军属待遇，还有给代耕的。不但一县不一致，而一区也不一致。我问上级，也说没有一定的规定。我想同样工作，政府一定同样的看待。而不能不一致。就是看他家中生活情形，也得把本身的免税点刨了，村里光说工人在厂，挣着几百斤小米，家中不顶人数。工人这是革命工作，并不是什么坏事，为什么这样看待呢？我提这个意见，并不是为了自己，而是为了少半数的工人。希望上缴有一定的规定，做革命工作者应当平等看待。希政府在报纸上详细答复。  　张世荣等三人合写编辑同志：
    关于工人家庭待遇及工人在家待遇，各地执行不一致，影响生产情绪。兹根据了解的情形，提出如下几个问题：（一）工人家属，因实行工资制，不应与军属同，但军火工厂工人，是否可取得军属地位，而享有军属之政治待遇？（二）战时工资标准较低，军火工人是否可因劳动力缺少等原因，受到代耕？（三）农业税及战勤代耕中，军火工人应否计人口？是否可以不出本人之战勤，本人不为别人代耕？（四）工人挣工资，应交纳所得税，办法规定如何？是否还应谈出战勤米？如应出，具体办法规定如何？（五）军火工人与非军火工人在地方上之待遇应有何区别？这些是我们在工作中常遇到的困难问题，建议政府应迅速规定统一办法，如有统一规定，希能通知各地方政府，统一执行，以纠正待遇不一致，免影响工友生产情绪。　　　　　　　　　　　
　　五中队二七二
    答：企业部第五中队二七二和张士荣同志及太岳端氏新华纸厂，所问关于工人家庭代耕、出勤、农业税上计人口扣除免税点问题，根据华北人民政府颁布的战勤办法，关于工人战勤负担及纳税规定，凡供给制的公营工厂、矿窑、作坊、商店，其职工、店员，均一律免服勤务，在家计算人口，扣除免税点。如系革命军人，调工作到公营军火工厂去的工人，其革命军籍依然存在，其家属仍按军属待遇，家中如无劳力，并得享受代耕。其他工人，店员，按政民人员待遇，家中如无劳力，生活确实困难者，经区批准，由村中代耕一部土地，如系薪金制的公管工厂、商店、职工、店员，和私人及合作经营之工厂商店员工，均须一律服勤。但为照顾工厂、商店等的生产，现又统一规定，可折纳勤米，不出人力工，工人每月每人出战勤米五斤，商人每月每人十斤，其薪给工资收入，扣除其本人免税点小米一百二十斤后（如吃厂店饭的扣免税点三十斤），剩余数按薪给工资所得税征纳百分之十至十二点五的税款。军火工人则减半征税，因为工人、店员已在工厂计算人口，扣除了免税点，故在农业税上，不再计算人口，扣除免税点。工人店员已出了战勤米及薪给工资所得税后，就不再负担其他勤务（村勤务代耕包括在内）或其他税款。五中队二七二及张世荣同志等所提问题，我们认为：
    （一）军火工人，过去在部队上工作，现在调到军火工厂当工人，这是为了军工生产，保证前线军火供应的伟大工作。其家庭仍应有革命军属的光荣称号，应享受革命军属政治上的待遇。但已实行薪给制，就不能再让村里代耕。在农业税上因薪给税已扣免税点，也不应再在家计负担人口扣免税点，在出勤上，可不直接出勤工，这一方面固然为了保证工作，但另外支援前线是我们每个人应尽的义务。军火工人为了支援前线，应减纳勤米，每人每月五斤（农民至少每月平均十斤到二十斤左右）。薪给工资所得税按规定减半征收。一般工人不减。
    （二）目前战时工资标准确是不高的，但按一般收入看，工人薪资收入还是比农民高几倍，平均计算农民出负担，工人也应出所得税。
