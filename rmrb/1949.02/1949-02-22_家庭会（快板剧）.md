(Clapper Talk Drama)
Chen Chongyao

Time: January

Characters: Old Man, Old Woman, Young Person A, Young Person B, Child A, Child B, Young Woman

(Gongs and drums sound together, the Old Man enters doing a Yangko dance)

Old Man: I'm the Old Man, fifty-three, my name is Wang Fushan. This year's New Year is going well, all thanks to last year's production effort. Seeing that spring is coming again, we must seize the time for plowing and fertilizing. I want to hold a family meeting to discuss how to do it. (To inside) Mother of the children, come out quickly! Let's hold a family meeting.

Old Woman: (Enters) I was sitting on the kang spinning thread when I suddenly heard the old man calling me. (To Old Man) Father of the children, what's all the fuss? Tell me quickly what's going on.

Old Man: Mother of the children, listen to me. Spring is already here. I want to hold a family meeting to discuss this year's great production.

Old Woman: Your idea is really good. The production plan needs to be made first. No one can take over and decide for us. We still need to discuss it together.

Old Man and Old Woman: (To inside) Children! Come over here, all of us, and let's hold a family meeting.

Young Woman, Young Person A, Young Person B, Child A, Child B: (Enter together, singing) Suddenly hearing the old man calling, everyone comes outside together. What's the matter that our parents called us for? Quickly tell us.

Old Man: You all sit down and listen to me slowly. The New Year has passed, and it's already spring. The wind is mild and the sun is warm. Hurry up and start production. Let's hold a family meeting to discuss how to do it this year.

Young Person A, Young Person B, Young Woman, Child A, Child B: (Sing together) Good, good, good! Okay, okay, okay! We all approve of this!

Child A: To hold a family meeting, we must first elect a chairman. Everyone, see who is good and can suggest someone casually.

Young Person B: My sister-in-law is good at production, her skills are high, and she is active in learning. I nominate my sister-in-law to be the chairman. I don't know if you agree?

Old Man and Old Woman: Good, good, good! Okay, okay, okay! We'll elect your sister-in-law as the chairman, we two agree too.

Young Woman: (Stands up) Since everyone agrees, I will be the chairman. Anyway, the whole family will discuss it together. You don't need to say "report" when you speak. Whoever has an opinion can raise it.

Young Person A: I feed the pigs, I deliver manure. Send the manure early and plow the land as soon as it thaws. Plow it loose, plant it well, and ensure that there are no missing seedlings in the field.

Young Person B: Plant more sweet potatoes, plant more grain, plant more cotton for clothes. When work is not busy in winter, the women in our family spin thread.

Old Man: I agree with these opinions. We also need to talk about how to hoe the seedlings. Hoeing the ground is not uncommon, but hoeing it well is not easy. Thin out the dense, and leave the big ones in the sparse, guaranteeing at least three hoeings, and not let half a ridge of land go to waste.

Young Person A: Don't be idle all year round. Don't let your shoulders leave the basket, and don't let your hands leave the hoe. Cut green grass, pad the pigsty, and grow more wheat to eat white flour.

Old Woman: Spin more thread, earn money, raise hens, sell eggs, and provide the whole family with oil and salt.

Young Woman: I weave cloth, and my mother spins thread, ensuring that the whole family has clothes to wear.

Child B: Report, Chairman, I want to speak. My sister-in-law goes to weave cloth. I hold the child and wind the thread, and I do the cooking and fire.

Child A: Chairman, listen to me. I go to school every day and read books. When I come home, I am not lazy. I water the ridges and deliver meals. When I have time, I pick up firewood, never running out of smoke for the stove. I sweep the threshing floor and the grinding shed clean and pad the livestock pen.

All sing: The family production plan is good, so we can dress warmly and eat well.

Old Man: (Laughs) This meeting is well held. It's not just talking about it. We'll see later who said they can do it. Don't look at my old age, I'm old but my heart is not old. I want to compare with you young people to see who does the job well.

Old Woman: (Laughs) Good, good, good, let's see. I also have a suggestion. Let's review ourselves often in the future. If anyone has shortcomings, point them out and correct them. Everyone often mentions it, and the shortcomings will naturally be less.

Children and Young People A and B say together: A meeting every ten days, and diligent self-criticism. Whoever has shortcomings, corrects them. Everyone should have a good time.

All sing: Right, right, right! Okay, okay, okay! Everyone works hard, and there is a guarantee to become prosperous. (They all dance the Yangko offstage) (Transmitted from Jínán Daily)

    老婆：（上）我坐在炕上正纺线，忽听老头子把我唤，（向老头）孩子的爹，嚷什么？有什么事儿快快说。
    老头：孩子的娘，听我言，现在已经到春天，我想开一个家庭会，商量今年大生产。
    老婆：你的意见真是好，生产计划要先搞，谁也不能来包办，还是大家来商讨。
    老头老婆：（向内）孩子们！都过来，咱们全家把会开。
    青年妇女、青年甲乙、儿童甲乙：（齐上唱）忽听老人一声唤，大家一齐到外边，爹娘唤俺有啥事？赶快对俺说一番。
    老头：你们都坐好，听我慢慢言，新年已过去，眼看是春天，风和日也暖，赶快来生产。咱们开个家庭会，讨论今年怎样干？
    青年甲乙、青年妇女、儿童甲乙：（齐唱）好好好！行行行！这样事情我们都赞成！
    儿童甲：要开家庭会，先得选主席，大家看谁好，可以随便提。
    青年乙：我嫂生产好，她的技术高，学习也积极，我提嫂子当主席，不知你们同意不同意？
    老头老婆：好好好！行行行！就选你嫂当主席，我们二人也同意。
    青年妇：（立起来）大家赞成我就当，反正全家来商量，说话不用喊报告，谁有意见谁就提。
    青年甲：我喂猪、我送粪，早日把粪送了去，开冻就去犁耙地。耙的松，种得好，保证地里不缺苗。
    青年乙：多栽红薯、多种粮，多种棉花穿衣裳，冬天活不忙，咱家妇女把线纺。

    青年妇：我织布，娘纺线，保证全家有衣穿。
    儿童乙：报告主席我发言，嫂子去织布，我抱孩子把线缠，做饭烧火我来干。
    儿童甲：主席听我言，每天上学把书念，回到家里不偷懒，浇水看畦和送饭，有空拾柴禾，永不断烧烟，碾棚磨棚打扫净，牲口圈里垫个干。
    齐唱：家庭生产计划好，穿的暖来吃的饱。
    老头：（笑）这个会开得好，不是说说就算了，以后咱们走着瞧，看谁说了能做到？别看我的年纪老，人老心不老，要跟你们青年来比较，看谁把活干的好。
    老婆：（笑）好好好，走着瞧，我还提个议，咱们以后常检讨，谁要有缺点，提出就改了，大家常常提，缺点自然少。
    儿童青年甲乙齐说：十天一次会，勤勤作检讨，谁有缺点谁改正，大家时光要过好。
    齐唱：对对对！行行行！大家努力干，发家致富有保证。（齐扭秧歌下）（转自冀南日报）
