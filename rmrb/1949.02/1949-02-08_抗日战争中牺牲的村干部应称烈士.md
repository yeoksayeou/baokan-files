　　Village Cadres Who Sacrificed Themselves During the War of Resistance Against Japan Should Be Called Martyrs
　　Editor:
　　In our village, three village cadres gloriously sacrificed themselves for the sake of fighting the enemy during the War of Resistance Against Japan. Because it was a chaotic time, we didn't have time to report it. After the victory of the War of Resistance Against Japan, we only filled out the martyr forms. The district instructed that they should be treated as martyrs, but we didn't apply for the pension certificates. Later, the village introduced the martyr's families to the county government to apply for the pension certificates. The county government said: "Since you didn't receive it before, you can't receive the pension certificate now. You should receive the certificate of honor." Later, they also said: "Village cadres didn't leave production, so even if they gloriously sacrificed themselves for their work, they can't be called martyrs." May I ask what title should be given to cadres who did not leave production but sacrificed themselves gloriously for their work? How should their families be treated? Should the government issue a pension certificate or a certificate of honor? I hope you can answer me soon.

Zhang Runtin Comrade:
    According to what you said about the three village cadres, if their sacrifice is as you described, they should be entitled to the title of martyr. At the same time, the county government should also issue a certificate of honor. As to whether they can enjoy material benefits, the answer is no, because they are cadres who did not leave production, and they did not cooperate with the troops in combat, so they are not entitled to material benefits.

### 抗日战争中牺牲的村干部应称烈士

专栏：询问与答复

　　抗日战争中牺牲的村干部应称烈士编辑同志：
    我村在抗日战争中，为工作对敌斗争光荣牺牲了三个村干部，因当时处于乱时未及呈报，到抗日战争胜利后，只填了烈士表，由区上指示应按烈士待遇，但未请领抚恤证。后由村介绍烈士家属到县府请领抚恤证，县政府说：“以前没领现在不能领抚恤证，应领光荣证。”后来又说：“村干部没脱离生产，虽为工作光荣牺牲，亦不能称为烈士。”请问不脱离生产的干部为工作而壮烈牺牲的应称为什么名义？其家属应如何待遇？政府该发抚恤证或光荣证？希即答复吾盼。
　　平山县第八区楼子洞村　张润庭张润庭同志：
    根据你所谈的三个村干部，他的牺牲情况如果象你说的那样时，是应该取得烈士的称号。同时县政府也应该发给光荣证，是不是能享受物质优待呢？是不能的，因他是不脱离生产的干部，同时又非配合部队作战，故不得享受物质优待。
