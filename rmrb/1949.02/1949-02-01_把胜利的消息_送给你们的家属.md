Dear comrades, frontline soldiers:
　　Victorious news is pouring in, and the atmosphere of victory is growing stronger day by day. The death of the Chiang bandit gang and the victory of the whole country are just around the corner. The entire work of the liberated areas is being inspired and leaping forward. We feel energetic in everything we do under this victorious situation, which is precisely your heroic and great double contribution. I would like to extend my most sincere New Year's greetings to all teachers and students of the Second Primary School!
　　Rest assured! During the New Year holiday, we guarantee to be responsible for sending the news of victory to your families, so that they can be happy and joyful in this atmosphere of victory. I wish you all good health forever!
