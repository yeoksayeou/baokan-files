　　Wang Xiaoxian Wins the Red Banner
　　Fei Yuemei and Yan Ruifen, female workers of a yarn factory in Shijiazhuang
　　Wang Xiaoxian is a fine yarn winding worker in the first shift of a yarn factory in Shijiazhuang. She has always been backward in her work and looked down upon. Whenever someone mentioned her, they would purse their lips and say, "Humph! Her? She'll never get a red banner in her life!" But in this recent competition, a red banner was also planted on her group's machine. Many people said with envious eyes, "Hey! She also got a red banner!"
　　Indeed, everyone knew that when Wang Xiaoxian was a machine operator, she liked to let the machine run out of control, and liked to be lazy, having to run to the restroom seven or eight times a shift. Later, when she was transferred to be a winding worker, her skills were not as good as others, she often dropped tubes, often broke the yarn, wound slowly, and didn't clean the fuzz completely. The machine operators were unwilling to let her tend their machines, and those close to her were worried for her, saying, "Xiaoxian, study hard! If you can't manage the machines, don't let the winding also be a failure!" Those who disliked her said, "Whoever's machine you're on is doomed."
　　After the competition, red banners had been planted on other people's machines, but on the machines she helped with, a red banner had never been planted. Those in her group all complained about her, those close to her often advised her, and in meetings, there was both criticism and persuasion. She thought to herself, "Now that the female workers are liberated, everyone is happily engaged in production, other people's machines can have red banners planted on them, why can't ours?" "The front line is winning battles every day, our factory is engaged in a production increase campaign, everyone is making progress, but I'm falling behind..." Looking at the bright red banners on other people's machines. The red banner is like a lamp, shining brightly, and she was indeed envious. Looking at her own machine, it was dark and gloomy, and she was indeed ashamed. She bit her lip and made a determination: "Work! I must get a red banner." People said she couldn't wind well, so she carefully watched how others wound, and she wound the same way, making sure there were no breaks, no dropped tubes, and no fuzz left behind. They said she was lazy, so she stayed by her machine, never leaving it, never running to the restroom. Look at her, she was sweating profusely, busy threading the yarn, joining the ends, and cleaning the machine. When eating, she often chewed on dry food while watching the machine. When getting off work, she didn't even bother to comb her hair or wash her face, determined to win a red banner.
　　Wang Xiaoxian has indeed made progress. Some people praised her, saying, "Xiaoxian is really good!" But some people, still not trusting, pursed their lips and said, "Humph! It's all in vain." Some said this, some said that, but Wang Xiaoxian did not lose heart or slacken her efforts. She only had one determination, which was "to keep working hard!"
　　As the saying goes, "Where there's a will, there's a way." This is true. When the ten days were up, and the results were tallied, a red banner was gloriously planted on Wang Xiaoxian's group's machine. The machine operators said in surprise, "Wow! It really has a red banner!" The whole group jumped up with joy. Other machine operators asked questions and smiled, all happily congratulating her.
　　From then on, the female workers in her group had no more complaints about her. Everyone was affectionate and warm, and their work became even more joyful.

　　王小仙得了红旗
    石家庄某纱厂女工  费月梅、严瑞芬
    王小仙是石家庄某纱厂甲班细纱络纱工，向来工作落后，被人看不起，谁一提到她，都是把嘴一噘：“哼！她呀！一辈子也得不上个红旗！”可是，在最近这一次竞赛中，她这组的车头上，也插上红旗了。好些人都带着惊羡的眼光说：“嘿！她也插上红旗啦！”
    不错，谁也知道，王小仙当看车工的时候，好跑车，好偷懒，一个班就得跑七八次茅房。后来调她当了络纱工，她手艺不如旁人熟练，好掉管，好断头，络的又慢，又拔不净穗。看车工都不愿让她看车，亲近她的都替她耽心，说：“小仙，好生学吧！看车不沾，可别络纱也不沾！”讨厌她的说：“你在谁车上，谁就倒了霉。”
    竞赛后，人家车上都插过红旗了，就她帮的车上，一次红旗也没插过。和她一组的，谁也埋怨她，和她亲近的常劝她，开会时，又是批评又是劝解，她心想：“现在女工解放了，大家欢天喜地闹生产，人家车上能插上红旗，咱车上就插不上？”“前方天天打胜仗，咱们工厂搞增产运动，都进步了，就我落后………”看看人家车上鲜红的旗子。红旗象盏灯，明晃晃的，心里确是馋得慌。看看自己车上，黑洞洞的，心里也确是羞愧得很，她咬了咬牙，下了个决心：“干！非得上红旗不可。”人家说她不会络她便细心的看别人怎样络，她也就怎样络，就不让断头、掉管、留穗，说她偷懒，她便一个劲儿不离车、不跑车、不跑茅房，你看她忙的满头是汗。紧的上线，接头，清洁车，吃饭的时候，也常是一边嚼干粮，一连看车。下班的时候，也顾不上梳头、洗脸，一心争取挂上红旗。
    王小仙可是进步了。有的人赞扬的说：“小仙可是不错啦！”但还有些人不信任的一噘嘴：“哼！还不是白费。”有的说这，有的说那，可是王小仙并没有灰过心，松过劲，她只是一个决心，就是“一个劲儿的干！”
    常言说：“只要有决心，不怕事不成”。这句话不错，十天到了，一结算，红旗很光彩的插在了王小仙这组的车上，车工们惊喜的说：“呀！真的插上红旗了！”全组都欢喜的跳了起来，别的车工们，这个也问，那个也笑，谁都欢喜的给她道贺。
    从此她们小组的女工，对她没有意见了，大家亲亲热热的，活儿也干的更欢了。
