　　Today Land Certificates Issued

　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　Peng Fei

     Today, land certificates were issued.
     My old man's whole family is truly happy!
     A bright red "official seal" is stamped in the middle,
     The government guarantees our property ownership,
     Announcing that from now on, land rights are determined.
     "A thousand-year contract will speak!"
     I reported the actual number of mu I was allocated and clearly filled in the four boundaries,
     Leaving a certificate for those who liberated me.
    　×　　　×　　　×
     Every member of the family has a share,
     Even my old woman's name is filled in.
     The comrade working asked her, "What's your name?"
     She was so shy that her old face turned red!
     —Now the world is truly "prosperous,"
     After living for more than half a lifetime, women have finally truly become "people"!
    　×　　　×　　　×
     Thinking back to the past, selling land to the landlord:
     Drawing a cross, pressing a fingerprint, it really hurt!
     Now,
     The Communist Party leads us to divide the land;
     The government has also issued us land certificates.
     From now on, we will be able to
     Cultivate well on our own land.
     I quickly wrapped it in cloth,
     And handed it to the old woman to hide securely in the cabinet,
     Our whole family must work harder,
     To wholeheartedly get rich and create a good life!

　　今天发下土地证
    彭斐
     今天发下了土地证。
     俺老汉全家真高兴！
     红腾腾“官印”盖在当中，
     政府保障咱财产所有权，
     宣布从今后地权已确定。
     “千年文约会说话！”
     俺分亩实报，四至填清，
     给俺翻了身的人留下凭证。
    　×　　　×　　　×
     全家大小每人都有份，
     把俺老婆子的名字也填上。
     那工作同志问她“唤啥？”
     还羞的她老脸通红！
     ——现在世道真“兴”的好，
     活了多半辈，妇女才真正成了“人”！
    　×　　　×　　　×
     想从前，卖地给老财：
     划十字、捺指印，实在心痛！
     到现在，
     共产党领导咱分下土地；
     政府又给咱发下土地证。
     往后，咱就能在自己的土地上，
     好好耕种。
     俺赶快把它用布包好，
     交给老婆子牢牢的藏在柜中，
     俺全家人更加要勤劳动，
     一心发财致富闹好光景！
