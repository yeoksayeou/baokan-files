Liberated Area Peasants Like New Year Pictures
    Liu Heng
    Every Lunar New Year, peasants in the liberated areas always buy New Year pictures to paste in their homes. This year, land reform in the old liberated areas has been largely completed, and the lives of peasants have generally improved. Coupled with this year being a year of great victory, even more people are buying New Year pictures. After the peasants buy the New Year pictures, some paste them on the walls, some paste them on the doors, and some even lovingly paste them on their kangs. Some also buy them as New Year gifts to give to their relatives and friends.
    Each liberated area prints a variety of New Year pictures, with a wide range of types. However, regardless of the type of New Year picture, the colors are very bright and beautiful, and the lines are drawn to suit the tastes of the peasants, being relatively simple and unadorned. The pictures are very vivid and detailed. The content of the pictures is also what the peasants most like to see. There is a type of New Year picture called "Election Picture," which depicts the people of the liberated areas having democratic rights, filling out ballots together, and earnestly electing their own village chief. There is one called "Learning Culture," which depicts the children of the peasants in the liberated areas having the right to study after emancipation, and studying and writing diligently together. There is one called "Family Happiness," which depicts a family of emancipated peasants in the liberated areas celebrating the New Year, with all family members, young and old, wearing brand-new clothes and pants, sitting around a table making dumplings. There is one called "Making Military Shoes," which depicts several emancipated women in the liberated areas twisting hemp rope, sewing soles, and making shoe uppers under the lamplight, supporting the People's Liberation War. There is one called "Children Comforting the Army," which depicts several rosy-cheeked boys and girls in the liberated areas, one packing comfort bags; a boy lying on the kang writing a comfort letter, looking as if he has encountered a word he can't write, attentively watching another child gesturing on his hand to help him. There is one called "Paying New Year's Greetings to Military Dependents," which depicts many people paying New Year's greetings to the families of revolutionary soldiers. There is also a New Year picture called "Liberation Army Attacking the City," which depicts the People's Liberation Army attacking a big city. The scene is really lively, with the heroic People's Liberation Army attacking, and the Kuomintang bandit troops in utter disarray, with infantry, artillery, cavalry, and engineers, at least a hundred people, with cannons, machine guns, grenades, city walls, bunkers, trenches, as well as enemy planes shot down and trains unable to move, and so on.
    The peasants in the liberated areas are already very indifferent to the old door gods and old New Year pictures. Everyone likes these new New Year pictures because these New Year pictures truly reflect their new lives after emancipation. The women like the "Making Military Shoes" the most, the children like the "Learning Culture" and "Children Comforting the Army" the most, and many people like to watch "Liberation Army Attacking the City" the most, because they can see their heroic sons in this New Year picture. In the Jin-Sui liberated area, there was an old man named Wang who pasted "Liberation Army Attacking the City" in the most conspicuous place in his house. Whenever someone came to his house, he would always point to an artilleryman in the picture and proudly say to people: "Look, this is like my tiger cub. He wrote a letter last time saying that he was firing cannons, bombarding the enemy in Linfen City!"
    These New Year pictures are all drawn by art workers in the liberated areas. Among them, most are intellectuals, and most have gone to the countryside and participated in the land reform work in the field. While helping the peasants in the countryside carry out land reform, they became familiar with the image, feelings, and life of the peasants. When they returned to the office, everyone would study and discuss together: What is the theme of this picture? How to compose it? How to color it? After the discussion, one person would draft it, and others would give suggestions. If it didn't work, they would revise and redraw it. In this way, everyone drew and drew again, revised and revised again. Often a painting draft had to be drawn four or five times. In the end, everyone was still not at ease and dared not make a printing plate. Some people sent the painting draft to the peasants to see and asked the peasants for their opinions. Some people even invited the peasants to the office and asked them to criticize the painting draft. Last September, the Jin-Sui liberated area People's Pictorial specifically held a street exhibition, specially asking nearby peasants to give opinions on many painting drafts. Of course, the nearby peasants went happily. Everyone looked at the painting draft, looked at it again, and simply couldn't bear to leave. Because they looked carefully, they also saw some minor problems. For example, several peasants who saw "Liberation Army Attacking the City" said to the comrades of the pictorial: "Our Liberation Army has killed the enemy, how come there is no blood on the enemy's body?" The comrades of the pictorial said: "This painting is prepared for you to paste during the New Year. During the New Year, painting a pool of blood is too unlucky, I'm afraid you won't like it." After hearing these words, those peasants immediately said: "What's unlucky about this? This is not a picture of our old folks seeking death by hanging, it's a picture of fighting the enemy. Is there anything unlucky about us killing the enemy? Killing the enemy is a great blessing!" The comrades of the pictorial were extremely moved by these words and quickly added bloodstains to the enemy. Later, when the New Year pictures were printed, everyone loved them even more.

　　解放区农民喜欢新年画
    刘衡
    每逢过旧历年，解放区的农民总要买些年画贴在自己家里。今年各个老解放区的土地改革大体已经完成，农民的生活普遍地得到改善。加上今年又是一个大胜利年，买年画的更是多了。农民们买回新年画，有的贴在墙上，有的贴在门上，有的更心爱的贴在自己的炕头上。也有买回去，当做新年礼物，送给自己的亲戚、朋友。
    每一个解放区都印出各种各样的年画，种类非常之多。可是，不管是哪一种年画，颜色都是十分鲜艳、漂亮，线条画得也合乎农民的口味，比较朴实、简单。画面很生动、细致。画的内容也都是农民最欢喜看的事情。有一种年画，名字叫“选举图”，画的是解放区人民有了民主权利，在一块儿填写选举票，认真地选举自己的乡长。有一种叫“学文化”，画的是解放区农民的孩子在翻身之后，有了念书的权利，在一块儿用心地读书写字。有一种叫“全家欢乐”，画的是解放区一家翻身农民过新年的时候，全家男女老少穿着崭新的衣裤，围着桌子包饺子。有一种叫“做军鞋”，画的是解放区的几个翻身妇女，在灯光下搓麻绳、纳鞋底、做鞋帮，支援人民解放战争。有一种叫“儿童劳军”，画的是解放区几个红红胖胖的男女儿童，一个在装慰劳袋；一个伏在炕上写慰劳信的男孩，象是遇到了不会写的字似的，聚精会神的在看另一个孩子给他用指头在手上比划。有一种叫“给军属拜年”，画着许多人给革命军人家属拜年。还有一种年画，名子叫“解放军攻城战”，画的是人民解放军在进攻大城市。那个场面真是热闹，上面有英勇进攻的解放军，又有狼狈不堪的国民党匪军，有步兵、又有炮兵，有骑兵，还有工兵，起码有一百多人，上面还有大炮、机关枪、手榴弹、城墙、碉堡、交通沟，以及敌人的被打落的飞机和无法开走的火车等等。
    解放区的农民对过去的门神和旧年画已经十分冷淡，大家喜欢的是这些新年画，因为这些新年画真实地反映了他们翻身后的新生活。妇女们最欢喜那张“做军鞋”，娃娃们最欢喜的是那种“学文化”和“儿童劳军”，还有很多人最爱看“解放军攻城战”，因为他们可以在这一张年画上面看见自己英勇的子弟兵。晋绥解放区有一个王老汉，他把“解放军攻城战”贴在房里最显眼的地方。只要有人到他家里去，他总是指着画上面的一个炮兵，骄傲地对人说：“你看，这就象是我的那个虎娃，他上次来了信，说他开着大炮，轰那临汾城的敌人！”
    这些年画，都是解放区的一些美术工作者画的。他们当中，多半是知识分子，而且多半都曾经下过乡，实地参加过土地改革的工作。他们一面在乡下帮助农民搞土地改革，一面就熟悉了农民的形象、感情和生活。他们回到机关，大家就在一块儿研究讨论：这一幅画的主题是什么？怎样构图？怎样着色？讨论好了，就由一个人起草，旁的人再提意见，不成就再改、再画。这样，每一个人都是画了又画，改了又改，往往一幅画稿要画四五遍。到后来，大家还是不放心，不敢制版。有的人就把画稿送给农民们看，请农民提意见，有的人还把农民请到机关来，请他们对画稿提出批评。去年九月，晋绥解放区人民画报社还特地开了一次街头展览会，专门请附近的农民给许多画稿提意见。附近的农民们当然都是高高兴兴地去了。大家把画稿看过来，看过去，简直就舍不得走开。因为看得仔细，就把好些小毛病也看出来了。譬如有几位农民看了“解放军攻城战”，对画报社的同志说：“咱们解放军把敌人打死了，怎么敌人身上没有血呢？”画报社的同志说：“这个画是准备给你们过年的时候贴的，过年的时候，画了一滩血，太不吉利了，怕你们不喜欢。”那几位农民听了以后，马上就说：“这有啥不吉利？这又不是画的咱们老百姓寻死上吊，是画的打敌人嘛。咱们打死敌人，有舍不吉利？打死了敌人，才是大吉大利！”画报社的同志听了这一些话，感动极了，赶快在敌人身上添上血迹。以后年画印出来，大家就更加喜爱了。
