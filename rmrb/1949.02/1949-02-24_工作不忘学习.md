　　Learning While Working
    Liu Wenyi, Northern Printing Bureau
    In the past, the workers of the Northern Printing Bureau lived a very undisciplined life and did not pay attention to learning. Since the launch of the production increase and loss compensation movement, not only has the work become particularly intense, but learning has also been strengthened. For example, Comrade Wang Guan is active and responsible in his work. He is a cadre of the trade union. The trade union often holds meetings, and he also works overtime after the meetings. Sometimes the trade union meetings go on until after 10 o'clock, and he still works when he gets back. Others advise him to go to sleep, but he says, "I'll work a little longer, I haven't done much work today!" He usually works until after 9 o'clock, and also reads books and newspapers, and writes articles for the newspaper. He often doesn't go to bed until after 11 o'clock. Sometimes when he writes articles, he doesn't write well the first time, so he writes again, and if he doesn't write well, he keeps writing, and he never gets discouraged. Since the communication group was organized, the trade union mobilized everyone to write articles, and he always mobilized everyone when he was free. On the evening of February 6th, after a meeting that lasted until after 10 o'clock, he went back and continued writing articles, writing straight until dawn. Some comrades got up, but he hadn't gone back to sleep yet. After he finished writing, he always asked others to revise it for him and was very modest. Comrade Jia Liye is usually very active in his work, and he often reads books and newspapers in the evening. He has written articles until after 12 o'clock many times. Comrade Chang Jinghua is particularly active in his work. Sometimes he works overtime voluntarily until after 10 o'clock, and he still reads books and newspapers when he returns to the dormitory. Those who didn't like to learn also started learning. For example, Comrade Gao Weiyi is very active in his work. He didn't like to learn in the past and had never written articles. Under the mobilization of the trade union and the influence of Wang Guan, he said, "Other people's articles have been published, but I haven't written one yet. I must make up my mind to write." One day he worked until after 9 o'clock, and then he wrote an article. Not only did he want to write himself, but he also mobilized everyone. The typesetting foreman did not participate in enough practical labor before, but he has also become active in increasing production and compensating for losses. He was selected as a model in the first and second model evaluations. He often uses practical examples to mobilize everyone to write articles.

　　工作不忘学习
    北方印刷局刘文义
    过去北方印刷局的工人们生活很散漫，对学习也不重视。自增产补损运动展开以来不但工作特别紧张，学习也加强了。如汪贯一同志对于工作积极负责，他是职工会干部，工会时常开会，会后还加工，有时工会开会到十多点钟，他回去还工作，别人劝他该睡觉了：他说“再作一会，一天还没什么工作呢！”平时工作到九点以后，还看书看报，给报社写稿子，时常十一点以后才睡觉，有时他写稿子，一次写不好，再写，写不好还写，总是不灰心的写下去。自组织了通讯小组，职工会动员大家写稿，他闲着的时候总是动员大家。在二月六日的晚上，开会到十多点钟，回去还写稿子，直写到天明，同志们有的起床了，他还没回去睡觉，在他写好后，总是叫别人给他改并且非常的虚心。贾立业同志，平时工作很积极，晚上还时常看书看报，有很多次写稿到十二点以后。常敬华同志，工作特别积极，有时加义务工到十多点钟，回到宿舍还看书看报。不喜欢学习的也学习了，如高维义同志，工作很积极，过去不好学习，也没写过稿子，经过职工会的动员和汪贯一的影响下，他说：“别人的稿子都登出来了，我一次都没写过，一定下决心要写”。有一天他工作到九点以后，他又写了一篇稿子，他不但自己要写，还动员大家。排字股长以前参加实际劳动不够，在增产补损中也积极起来了，在第一、二次评模范的时候，被选了模范。他经常用实际的事情做例子动员大家写稿。
