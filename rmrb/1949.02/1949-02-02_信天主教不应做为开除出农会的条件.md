Inquiry and Answer

　　Believing in Catholicism Should Not Be a Condition for Expulsion from the Farmers' Association
Comrade Editor:
　　Wang Qingdeng's family in Wang Village is a family of revolutionary martyrs. There are only four people in his family now: his mother, his brother, his sister-in-law, and his little nephew. There is no other reason, but they were expelled from the Farmers' Association simply because they believe in Catholicism. There are two similar worker families who have also been expelled. Have you studied whether this is correct? Hoping for an answer.

Answer: Having believed in Catholicism in the past should not be a condition for expulsion from the Farmers' Association. The Farmers' Association is an organization of the peasant masses. Except for loafers who do not engage in production, or saboteurs with definite political problems, ordinary laboring and productive peasants should be allowed to participate as long as they are approved by the Farmers' Association. It is inappropriate that Wang Qingdeng's family was expelled simply because they believed in Catholicism in the past. Because the democratic government allows people freedom of religious belief, the general masses who blindly believe in religion should be enlightened and educated to raise their awareness and gradually free them from superstition and ignorance, rather than forcibly ordering them to stop participating in mass activities. We hope that District One of Feixiang County will pay attention to correcting this.

专栏：询问与答复

　　信天主教不应做为开除出农会的条件编辑同志：
    王庄王清登家是烈属，他家中现在只有四口人：他母亲、他兄弟、兄弟媳和小侄子。别的原因没有，只因为他们信天主教被开除出农会。类似的工属有两户也都开除了。你们研究对否？希解答。

    答：过去信过天主教，不能做为开除出农会的条件，农会是农民群众的组织，除了不事生产的二流子，或者是确有政治问题的破坏分子等，一般劳动生产的农民，只要经过农会通过，都应允许参加。王清登家只因过去信过天主教，就被开除是不妥当的。因为民主政府允许人民信教自由，对一般盲目信仰宗教的群众，应以启发教育的方式提高他们的觉悟、逐步地把他们从迷信与无知中解脱出来，而不是强迫命令地停止他们参加群众活动。希望肥乡一区注意纠正。
