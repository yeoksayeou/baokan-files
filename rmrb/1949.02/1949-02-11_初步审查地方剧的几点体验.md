　　Preliminary Experiences in Reviewing Local Operas
    Zhang Guochu
    Gao Diao is a popular local opera in the Hebei-Shandong-Henan region. In accordance with the spirit of the People's Daily editorial "Carry out the Reform of Old Operas in a Planned and Step-by-Step Manner," we conducted a preliminary review of local operas. Of the 151 operas initially reviewed, 15 were beneficial, 49 were harmless, and 85 promoted feudal oppression and slave morality, licentiousness, enjoyment, and superstition. In the 64 operas currently allowed to be performed, the harmless portion accounts for the largest share (preliminary review is based on allowing performances that contain no or little toxicity). From the review process, we experienced the following issues:
    (1) Most local operas do not have scripts and are entirely passed down orally, from one master to another (Gao Diao is further divided into Upland Style - Kaifeng Style, and Lowland Style - Shandong Style). The transmission becomes distorted through repeated passing, especially by clowns who add lines and vulgar antics without principles, saying whatever comes to mind, often ruining even good operas. For example, in "Hejian Prefecture," Cheng Yaojin's wife casually says: "Swallows fly eastward, all tails face west, flying into the crack of the butt, grabbing a handful of mud to paste you to death, paste you to death, so you can't go to the theater and freeload cigarettes." And makes vulgar gestures. Randomly adding these words and actions that have nothing to do with the plot. Some also casually add current phrases when performing historical dramas, which is even more unacceptable. Therefore, it is necessary to record local operas (relying on members of various cultural associations to record at any time), on the one hand to facilitate review and modification, and on the other hand to avoid arbitrarily adding bad lines and scenes. The difficulty of not having a fixed script was felt during the preliminary review.
    (2) Local operas with folk stories are relatively good, such as "Three Persuasions," which opposes abuse and promotes harmonious families. Li Dengke's family severely abused his wife, and Li constantly beat his daughter-in-law based on his daughter's words. After being persuaded by Aunt Yu, the whole family became harmonious. Its shortcomings are: there are still many feudal terms and vulgar actions in the persuasion. Aunt Yu said: "Child, you should suffer some grievances! In the future, I will erect a monument and plaque for you." And promotes feudal terms of the three obediences and four virtues.
    "Three Sedan Chairs" and "Kidnapping the Mule" are operas against bullies. For example, in "Three Sedan Chairs," the bully Zhang Bingyin saw that Cui's daughter was good-looking, and relied on his power to kill Cui's daughter's husband with drugged wine, forcing Cui's daughter to be his concubine. Cui's daughter stubbornly refused. The story was originally not bad, but, in the three sedan chair persuasions, people's words contained many feudal terms. Such as advising women: "Don't stand in front of the door, standing in front of the door causes trouble," meaning to let women "not go out of the gate, and not go out of the second gate." Another example is advising men: "Don't care about the ugliness and beauty of marrying a wife, the most important thing is that she can light a fire for you, cook and have children." Meaning that women's tasks are only "cooking, cooking, and raising children," and feudal education was carried out.
    If these plays delete or modify feudal terms and vulgar scenes, they can become relatively good plays. There are also some local operas such as "Two-Stringed Instrument" and "Four-Drum String," etc., most of which reflect folk stories, such as non-autonomous marriage, the shackles of feudal morality, and family harmony. The form is simple, so-called tight in seven places and loose in eight (meaning few people). One opera is sung for half a day by two or three people. Although there is more feudalism and lewdness, folk stories are different from historical dramas. Some places more directly reflect the people's own affairs. These dramas have a greater connection with the masses, and the masses like to watch them. If the toxic things are removed, they can still play an educational role at this stage. These folk tunes contain many tunes that express the emotions of the masses. If they can be carefully studied and the beneficial parts absorbed, they will also contribute greatly to the development of realistic opera.
    Therefore, we believe that old operas belonging to folk stories and folk tunes should be focused on reviewing and transforming, removing their harmful parts, and carefully modifying them can be greatly promoted.
    (3) Old operas are the product of feudal society, so they have a strong feudal color. The ruling class used old operas to promote feudal ideas and conduct slave education, distorting historical truths, and vilifying the leaders of peasant uprisings (such as Huang Chao, Li Zicheng, Hong Xiuquan, etc.) as "rebels" and "bandits"; those who colluded with foreign nationalities and "loyally served" foreign nationalities were traitors like Cheng Jingsi, Peng Peng, Shi Gong, Huang Tianba, Zeng Guofan, etc. were praised as "national loyalists," advocating national disgrace and singing the praises of emperors. In "Nine O'Clock Sky," Ma Yi (servant) killed his daughter and gave up his life for the "master"; in "Chopping Wood City," Mu Cheng was beheaded for the "master," and the ruling class praised him greatly, saying that "loyalty and righteousness" was China's "excellent old morality." In "South Heaven Gate" (also known as "June Snow"), Cao Fu (old servant) sacrificed his life to save Miss Yulian and froze to death in the snow. The "Queen Mother" thought he was "loyal and respectable" and led the Eight Immortals and the old immortals to welcome him "ascend to heaven" and made him the "Duke of Land" in the South Heaven Gate, advocating slave education. There are also "Qishan Horn", "Orchid Mountain", "First Jizhou", "Second Jizhou", "Han Xin Fortune Telling", "Back Head", "Yin Yang Bao", "Exploring the Earth Cave"... etc. Demonic events, promoting superstition to confuse the masses. Also, "Scattering Melon Seeds," "Double-Headed Horse," "Leopard Mountain," "Wealth and Prosperity," "Luo Zhang Kneeling Upstairs"...etc. Lewd plays to promote licentiousness, enjoyment, and sensuality to numb and corrupt young people. In order to consolidate his ruling position, the ruling class promoted fatalism such as "wealth and prosperity are in the sky" and "destined in fate," so that you dare not resist. If you resist while alive, you cannot escape the so-called heavenly and underworld punishments, so that you can be a slave alive and die without resentment, and willingly be a slave. This type of play is the most in the review, and most of them are purely harmful and useless. This type of play should be resolutely stopped from being performed, otherwise it will be harmful to the people.
    (4) Although the good side of the old operas exposed the crimes of the feudal ruling class, the licentiousness and shamelessness of emperors, nobles, and landlords, as well as resistance to feudal oppression, resistance to corrupt officials, and opposition to bullying, even the better plays still carry some feudal superstition, lewd low-level tastes, and humiliating words and scenes for the poor, such as "Anti-Xuzhou" is a play against feudal oppression and eliminating bullies, but Wang Long (old prince)'s relative is a poor farmer who digs the soil, and says on stage: "I am digging taro at home, the old prince asks me to be the prefect, I am dumping feces at home, the old prince asks me to take over the seal." Deliberately mocking and ridiculing, which is malicious humiliation to the poor working people. Another example is "Yan'an Prefecture," which is an anti-bullying play, but it intersperses many strange and low-level sentences, turning the oppressed people into clowns, turning people's hatred for bullies into jokes, and reducing the crimes of Bi Youji's shameless behavior.
    In addition, when the story cannot be handled, it uses gods and ghosts to solve the problem, such as the little ghost holding sound in "Beating the Barbarians" (this name should also be revised), and the Qilang's dream in "Bumping the Stele". Or things that will happen in the future have a premonition, such as "heart blood surge," "crows cry overhead, eyelids jump," or "last night a dream was ominous, dreaming of a mouse holding a cat," dreaming of this and that.
    Based on the above experience, we believe that the following points are worth mentioning as a reference for reviewing and transforming local operas:
    (1) Plays that have been distorted by the ruling class's historical truth, such as "Zeng Guofan Attacks Nanjing," "Shi Gong's Case"...etc. cannot be solved by simply modifying the words. This type of play must be completely remade with a new historical perspective. The traitorous faces of Zeng Guofan and others should be exposed, and the just peasant uprisings should be praised. Create new historical dramas, "bring forth the new from the old," only the emergence of new scripts can replace the old things, so we believe that in the work of reforming old dramas, creating historical dramas with new viewpoints is a more effective and basic method.
    (2) Plays that are not toxic today are allowed to be performed, but this does not mean that we actively promote these things. We believe that today's "preliminary review" is only the beginning of the reform of old dramas. Further transformation of each drama is still a more important and longer-term work. Therefore, each performing troupe has the task of exposing the parts of each play that promote feudal oppression, slave education, promote superstition, and promote licentiousness and sensuality, modify them, and report the modified opinions to the Drama and Music Committee of the Cultural Association for unified research. The performance of each play should be a responsible attitude to the people.
    (3) Even the better programs contain feudal superstitious low-level lewd words and scenes that should be deleted or modified. One cannot ignore them because they are better. This type of play can be turned into a better program with a little modification. Folk stories that are closely related to people's lives but not included in "official history" or folk tunes that are easy to be transformed into operas should be collected and used with greater efforts to study and transform them.

　　初步审查地方剧的几点体验
    张国础
    高调是冀鲁豫最流行的一种地方戏。根据人民日报专论“有计划有步骤地进行旧剧改革工作”的精神，我们对地方戏作了初步审查。初步审查过的一百五十一出戏中有利部分的占十五出，无害部分的四十九出，提倡封建压迫奴隶道德，淫乱享乐色情和迷信的八十五出。在现在准许上演的六十四出戏中，无害部分的分量最大（初步审查是本着没有什么毒素或稍有利便准予上演），从审查过程中我们体验到下边几个问题：
    （一）地方戏大都没有剧本，完全凭口传，一个师傅一个传授，（高调又分上路调——开封调，下路调——山东调），你传我我传他，传来传去便传走了样，特别丑角更是无原则的信口增添，或出些庸俗的怪样，想起什么说什么，往往把较好的戏也添坏了。如“河间府”程咬金的老婆顺口说：“燕燕往东飞个个尾巴都朝西，一飞飞到屁缝里抓把稀泥糊死你，糊死你，再不能到戏院里骗烟吸。”并且作出庸俗的动作。随便增添这些与剧情毫无相干的话与动作。还有的演历史剧随便增加一些现实词句，这更是要不得的。因此很有必要把地方戏记录下来（依靠文协各团体会员随时记录），一方面便于审查与修改，一方面以避免随便增加坏的台词与场面。初步审查中便感觉到没有固定剧本的困难。
    （二）地方剧属于民间故事性的比较好，如“三劝”是反虐待和睦家庭的，李登科一家对妻非常虐待，李氏听女儿之言不断打骂媳妇。经于大娘相劝之后，全家和睦了。它的缺点是：在劝说之中仍然有许多封建词句和庸俗的动作。于大娘说：“孩呀你受点委屈吧！将来给你立碑、挂匾。”以及宣扬三从四德的封建词句。
    “三上轿”“拐骡子”是反恶霸的戏，如“三上轿”恶霸张丙寅看见崔氏女长的好看，依仗势力用药酒害死了崔氏女的仗夫，逼迫崔氏女为妾，崔氏女顽强不屈。故事本来还不错，但，三次上轿相劝人们的几段话中都包含着好多封建词句。如劝妇女一段中：“休在门前站，站在门前惹祸端”意思是让妇女“大门不出，二门不迈。”又如劝男人的一段：“娶媳妇不要管丑和俊，当紧能给你烧把火，作作饭把孩子生。”意思说妇女的任务只有“烧锅，做饭，养孩子”，进行了些封建教育。
    这些剧如果删掉或修改了封建词句与庸俗场面，便可成为比较好的剧，还有些地方小戏如“两架弦”“四鼓弦”等等大部分是反映着民间故事的，如婚姻不自主，封建道德的束缚，家庭和睦的事情，形式简单，所谓七紧八松（言其人少）一出戏两三个人便唱半天，虽然里边封建、淫荡的较多，但民间故事和历史剧不同，某些地方更直接的反映了群众自己的事情，这些剧和群众牵连较大，群众很喜欢看，如ｑｉá＠①去里边有毒素的东西，在现阶段还能起到一些教育意义。这些民间调子里边含有许多表达群众情感的曲调，如能精心钻研，吸取有利部分，对现实歌剧的开展上，贡献也很大。
    因此我们认为：凡属于民间故事民间调子一类的旧戏，应当着重审查改造，去其有害部分，认真的加以修改便可大大推广。
    （三）旧戏正因为是封建社会的产物，因而带有浓厚的封建色彩，统治阶级利用旧戏来宣扬封建思想进行奴隶教育，歪曲了历史真象，把农民起义的领袖（如黄巢、李自成、洪秀全等），污蔑为“造反”“流寇”；把勾结异民族，为异民族“效忠”的走狗汉奸如程敬思、彭朋、施公、黄天霸、曾国藩等则表扬为“国家忠良”提倡民族失节，歌颂帝王。“九更天”的马义（仆人）为“主”杀女舍身；“斩木城”的木城替“主”受斩，统治阶级则大加赞扬说“忠义浩气”是中国“绝好的旧道德”。“南天门”（又名“六月雪”）里的曹甫（老仆人）牺牲自己的性命救了玉莲小姐，冻死在雪中，“王母娘娘”念他“忠义可敬”就领了八仙和老仙迎接他“升天”，封为南天门的“都土地”，提倡奴隶教育。还有什么“歧山角”、“兰花山”、“头冀州”、“二冀州”、“韩信算卦”、“背头”、“阴阳报”、“探地穴”……等出神出鬼，提倡迷信来迷惑群众。又用“撒瓜子”、“双头马”、“豹子山”、“富贵图”、“罗璋跪楼”……等淫荡戏提倡淫乱享乐色情来麻醉腐蚀青年，统治阶级为巩固他的统治地位，提倡什么“富贵在天”，“命里注定”等宿命论，使你不敢反抗，你如活着反抗也逃不过所谓天上和阴间的刑罚，让你活着为奴，死而无怨，甘心情愿的当奴隶。这一类戏在审查中最多，大都是纯害而无益，关于这一类的戏应当坚决停止其上演，否则对人民为害不浅。
    （四）旧戏好的一面虽然暴露了一些封建统治阶级的罪恶，帝王贵族，地主阶级的荒淫无耻以及反抗封建压迫反抗贪官污吏，反对恶霸行为，但就是比较好的剧里或多或少的仍然带着一些封建迷信淫荡低级趣味和污辱穷人的词句和场面，如“反徐州”是反对封建压迫除恶霸的剧，但王龙（老王爷）的亲戚是个种地倒粪的穷人，上场说：“正在家中刨芋头，老王爷叫我坐知州，正在家中倒大粪，老王爷叫我去接印”。故意挖苦讥讽，对穷苦的劳动人民是恶意的污辱。又如“延安府”是反恶霸戏，但当中穿插许多怪哩怪气的低级句，把受压迫的人变成丑旦，把人们对恶霸的忿恨变为玩笑，减轻了毕尤吉的罪恶无耻行为。
    另外，故事一到没法处理的时候，便利用神鬼出现，以解决问题，如“打蛮子”（这个名字也应当修正）中的小鬼捧音，“碰碑”中的七郎托梦。或事情未来预先便有感觉，什么“心血来潮”、“乌鸦当头叫，眼皮崩崩跳”或“昨晚一梦大不祥，梦见老鼠衔个猫”梦见这梦见那的。
    根据以上的体验我们认为有以下几点，值得提出来作为审查改造地方戏的参考：
    （一）被统治阶级歪曲了历史真象的戏如“曾国藩打南京”、“施公案”……等光修改词句是不能解决问题的，这一类的戏必须用新的历史观点彻底翻造。曾国藩等的汉奸面目应当揭穿，正义的农民起义应当表扬。创造新的历史剧，“推陈出新”，只有新的剧本的产生，才能代替了旧的东西，因此我们认为在改革旧剧工作中，创造新观点的历史剧，这是比较有效的基本办法。
    （二）没什么毒素的剧，今天虽然允许上演，但不等于我们积极提倡这些东西。我们认为今天进行的“初步审查”，仅仅是旧剧改革工作的开端，具体到每一个剧上的进一步改造，还是一件比较重要而又比较长期的工作。因此，各个上演剧团都有任务将每出戏中含有提倡封建压迫，奴隶教育，提倡迷信、提出淫乱享乐色情的部分，检举出来，进行修改，并将修改的意见报告文协戏剧音乐委员会，以便统一研究。对每一个剧的演出，都应当是对人民负责任的态度。
    （三）就是比较好的节目里边含有封建迷信低级淫荡的词句与场面也应当删掉或修改，不能因为是较好的便不管不问，这一类的戏只要＠＠去去稍加修改便可成为较好的节目了。和人民生活联系较密切的不入“正史”的民间故事或便利于改造成歌剧的民间调子应当着重搜集和使用更大的力量去研究、改造。
