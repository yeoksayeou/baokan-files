　　Improving Learning in Our Factory
　　To the Editor:
    My name is Zhou Jinsheng, and I am a worker in Department One of the Shijiazhuang Guangming Factory. I have some opinions on the learning situation of us workers. Learning in our factory is not very enthusiastic, especially among the workers in Department One, because there are problems with the factory's learning methods. For example, we are asked to sign up for learning after work. We work all day and are physically tired. After work, we must rest. Even if we want to learn, we can't manage it after working all day. Moreover, most of the workers in Department One are from rural areas, some living more than ten miles away. Therefore, I and other workers have discussed an idea, and I don't know if it is feasible: We hope that the factory can make some blackboards, buy some chalk, and distribute them to each work unit. For example, in our Department One, if we hang a blackboard on the furnace platform, everyone can learn during work breaks (there are about twenty or thirty minutes between finishing one furnace and starting another). At the same time, the floor is all black square bricks, so we can practice writing at will. This way, we can learn without leaving our work posts and without delaying work. We also have very little time to read the newspaper here. We hope that the leadership can read to us during our work breaks, such as the Labor Resolution in the newspaper. We are willing to know about these things.
    Respectfully, Guangming Factory Worker Zhou Jinsheng
    
    Editor's Note: Comrade Zhou Jinsheng's suggestion is very good. We hope that the leaders of Guangming Factory will study and improve it. Other factories should also pay attention to this issue.

### 改进我们工厂的学习

　　改进我们工厂的学习编者同志：
    我叫周金生，是石家庄光明厂一部的一个工人，对我们工人学习上有点意见。我们厂子里的学习还不很起劲，特别是我们一部工人，因为厂子里学习方法上有毛病，譬如说：要我们报名参加学习，都是下工以后，我们成天工作，身体疲累，下班后都必须休息，自己即使愿意学习，因为作了一天工，也顾不过来了，何况一部工人大部都是乡村里的，离家远的有十几里地的，所以我和其他工友商量了一个意见，不知道是不是可以：我们希望工厂里制些黑板，买些粉笔，发给每个工作单位。就说我们一部里，如果在炉台上挂块黑板，工作中休息时间大家都可学习（我们工作完一个炉子到开另一个炉子之间差不多有二、三十分钟的时间）。同时地下都是黑黑的方砖，可以随便练习写字，这样不离工作岗位，不耽误工作，又可以学习。我们这里读报时候也很少，希望领导上在我们工作闲暇时，给我们来读一读，如报纸上的劳大决议等，这些我们都愿意知道。
    敬礼　光明厂工人周金生    　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　
    编者按：周金生同志的意见很好，希望光明厂领导同志研究改进，其他各厂也应注意这一问题。
