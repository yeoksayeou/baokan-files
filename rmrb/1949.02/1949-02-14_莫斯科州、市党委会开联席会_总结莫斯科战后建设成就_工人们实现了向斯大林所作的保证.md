Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 12th: TASS Moscow dispatch: The Moscow Oblast and Moscow City Committees of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union held a joint meeting here from February 1st to 4th. Popov, Secretary of the Moscow Oblast and City Committees of the CPSU, summarized the achievements of Moscow Oblast and City's economic construction after the war at the conference, stating that in industry, due to the early completion of the 1948 plan, the industry of Moscow Oblast and City has exceeded the pre-war total output value by 10%. During the first three years of the post-war five-year plan, the value of goods produced by Moscow's industry exceeded the plan by 7.5 billion rubles. The workers of Moscow's industry fulfilled their guarantee to Stalin. In 1948, capital accumulation exceeded the plan by 2 billion rubles. Moscow's machine-building industry has invented the first automatic factory in the Soviet Union for manufacturing automobile pistons. All processes—from the beginning of melt management to the installation of finished parts—are fully automatic. The Moscow coal mine has developed into an important fuel supply base for the country. Moscow miners completed the total coal output of the five-year plan in less than three years, exceeding the pre-war output by 2.9 times. In agriculture, the most important crops exceeded the pre-war total harvest and yield per hectare as early as 1947. Last year, collective farms in the Moscow Oblast delivered one million poods more grain to the state than planned, and four million poods more vegetables than in 1940. In terms of urban construction, the implementation of Stalin's general plan for the construction of Moscow, which was interrupted by the war, has been continuing on a large scale in the past few years after the war. By the beginning of 1949, the capital's main public utilities had exceeded the pre-war level. In the first three years of the five-year plan, 4 billion rubles were invested in Moscow's municipal development, and 620 million rubles were invested in the Moscow Oblast. In 1949, approximately 1.7 billion rubles were allocated for the further development of Moscow's municipality, which is almost twice that of 1946. Popov emphasized Moscow's role in the overall achievements of the Soviet Union in cultural construction. Moscow is recognized as the center of Soviet culture, science, and education. In 1914, Moscow only had 20 higher education institutions, but now it has 80. In terms of the scale of cadre training and the number of colleges, teachers, and students, even the capitals of all capitalist powers cannot be compared with the Soviet capital. Moscow currently has a total of 127,000 students, exceeding the pre-war figure by 30%.

  　总结莫斯科战后建设成就       
    工人们实现了向斯大林所作的保证
    【新华社陕北十二日电】塔斯社莫斯科讯：苏联共产党莫斯科州与莫斯科市党委会，于二月一日至四日在此间举行联席会议。联共莫斯科州委与市委会书记波波夫，在大会上总结战后莫斯科州、市经济建设的成就称：在工业方面，由于提前完成一九四八年计划，莫斯科州、市的工业已超过战前生产总额百分之十。战后五年计划的头三年期间，莫斯科工业出产货物的价值，超过计划七十五亿卢布。莫斯科工业的工人，实现了他们向斯大林所作的保证。在一九四八年，资金积垒超过计划二十亿卢布。莫斯科机器制造业已发明了全苏联第一个制造汽车活塞的自动工厂，一切过程——由熔铸的管理开始以至现成零件的装置为止，全部都是自动的。莫斯科煤矿已发展为全国的重要的燃料供给地。莫斯科矿工在不到三年的期间，完成了五年计划的煤炭总产量，超过战前产量二点九倍。在农业方面，最重要的农作物，早在一九四七年即已超过战前的总收获量和每公顷的产量。去年，莫斯科州集体农场交给国家的谷物，超过计划一百万普特，交纳的菜蔬比一九四○年多四百万普特。在市政建设方面，斯大林莫斯科建设总计划的实施，曾因战事而中断，在战后几年来，正在继续大规模地进行中。至一九四九年初，首都主要公用事业已超过战前水平。五年计划的前三年，投资于莫斯科市政发展的资金达四十亿卢布，投于莫斯科州的达六亿二千万卢布。一九四九年，拨作进一步发展莫斯科市政的款项约十七亿卢布，几等于一九四六年的两倍。波波夫强调莫斯科在文化建设方面在苏联所获总成绩中所起的作用。莫斯科被公认为苏联文化科学和教育的中心。一九一四年，莫斯科只有二十所高等学校，而现在有八十所。在干部训练的规模和学院、教师、学生的数目方面，甚至全部资本主义大国首都，也不能与苏联的首都相提并论。莫斯科现有学生总数十二万七千人，超过战前百分之三十。
