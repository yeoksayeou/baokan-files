[Taihang Electric] The four counties of Qinyang, Bo'ai, Wenxian, and Wuzhi in the Fourth Special District of Taihang have low-lying terrain, with the Qin River running through them. During the summer and autumn seasons, the Qin River constantly breaches its banks, and local rainwater also accumulates on the ground, resulting in floods nine out of ten years. Last winter, taking advantage of the unfrozen ground, efforts were intensified to repair the river and build dikes, from early December to the 25th, with considerable achievements. This time, the river repair involved over 267,000 workdays of civilian labor, allowing over 59,000 mu of low-lying land to avoid flooding this year. At the same time, over 34,000 mu of paddy fields were newly built and restored, which together can increase grain production by over 53,000 shi. This has laid a good foundation for this year's production increase. Qinyang mainly repaired seven "Li Rivers" (small rivers for irrigation), increasing paddy fields by 26,560 mu, and dug nine "Lao Rivers" (rivers for draining floodwater), reducing flooded land by 38,900 mu. Wenxian also dug five "Lao Rivers," which can reduce flooded land by 20,200 mu, and repaired 2,880 zhang of the Qin River dike. Bo'ai repaired three "Li Rivers." This river repair and dike construction was a considerable mass movement. The counties gained the following experiences in organization and leadership: 1. Consistently implement propaganda and mobilization work. Slogans such as "Eliminate water disasters and completely turn over" and "Exchange idle labor for busy labor and strive for a good harvest next year" were put forward to the masses. For each village, the masses were informed of the amount of work assigned to the village and how many people could complete it in a few days, which resolved the masses' concerns about the size of the project. In the work process, mass blackboards and model banners were widely used to boost the morale of the masses. 2. The combination of fair and reasonable specific division of labor and in-depth inspection. It is not possible to generally assign a long section. The work should be divided according to one cubic meter of earthwork, and at the same time, the looseness or tightness of the soil and the difficulty of excavating and raising the soil should be taken into account. Experience has proven that this is an effective way to improve labor efficiency. However, it must be combined with specific inspection work, so as to avoid some masses simply striving to complete the work early and go home quickly, and doing the work carelessly. 3. Organizational form and method of going to work. The organization is based on the needs of the project, and is composed of brigades, teams, squads, etc. according to the number of people, but the teams should not be mechanically organized according to the number of people. For example, if the number of people in a village or street is similar, they will be organized into a team or squad. Because the masses repairing the river cook and eat together, and it is easier for the masses in the village and street to discuss whether the food is good or bad, and whether they are at a loss or a profit. The method of going to work is: repair "Lao River." Because everyone suffers from flooding, the whole village goes to work according to labor. The "Li River" is repaired by the beneficiary households. Those with labor provide labor, and those with water land but no labor appropriately pay wages according to the amount of land. 4. Scientific measurement and accurate calculation of the project must be carried out in advance to make all preparations. It is necessary to accurately measure how much earthwork is to be moved, calculate how much labor is needed, and notify the districts and villages to mobilize the people, bring how much food, and at the same time prepare the tools, otherwise a little carelessness will waste a lot of people's labor. At that time, the requirements for cadres were: "Cadres spend a little more effort, and the masses will benefit immeasurably." 5. It should be carried out under unified planning and unified leadership to overcome undesirable tendencies such as "village centrism." Relevant counties must also cooperate to avoid Wenxian repairing the river and sending the water to Wuzhi, which would flood Wuzhi again.

　　沿沁河农民充分准备大生产
  　修疏河道防止洼地水患           
    增修水田三万余亩预计增产五万石
    【太行电】太行四专区沁阳、博爱、温县、武陟四县地势低下，沁河横贯其间，夏秋之季，沁河不断决堤，本地雨水也淤蓄地面，历来是十年九淹。去年冬季趁地未冻，抓紧修河筑堤，从十二月初至廿五日结束，成绩相当可观。此次修河共用民工二十六万七千余工，使五万九千余亩洼地今年可以免于水淹，同时增修与恢复了水田三万四千余亩，两项共可增产粮食五万三千余石。这对今年生产长一寸，做了很好的准备。沁阳主要是修理了“利河”（浇地的小河）七条，增加了水田二万六千五百六十亩，挖了“涝河”（雨涝时撤水河）九条，减少淹地三万八千九百余亩。温县也挖了“涝河”五条，可减少淹地二万零二百余亩，并修了沁河堤二千八百八十丈。博爱修“利河”三条。这次修河筑堤，是一个相当规模的群众运动，各县在组织领导上获得了以下几个经验：一、始终贯彻宣传鼓动工作。对群众提出了“消灭水患，彻底翻身”，“闲工换忙工，争取明年好收成”等口号。对于每一村庄，都给群众说明该村分的工有多大，多少人几天可以完成，解决了群众不知多大工程的思想顾虑。在工作过程中，普遍地运用了大众黑板、模范旗等办法提高群众情绪。二、公平合理的具体分工与深入检查相结合。不能笼统的分给多长一段。要按土方一立方米分工，同时要照顾土松土紧，出土起土费劲与否。经验证明，这是提高劳动效率有效的办法。但要结合具体的检查工作，以免有些群众单纯争取早完工快回家，潦草从事。三、组织形式与出工办法。组织是按工程的需要，以人数编成大队中队分队等，但也不能机械的死按人数编队，如一村或一街的人数差不多时，就编成一个中队或一个分队。因为群众修河在一块起火吃饭，吃好吃坏，吃亏便宜，本村本街群众自己好商量。出工的办法是：修“涝河”。因水淹大家都受害，全村按劳力出工。修“利河”是受益户修，有劳力者出劳力，有水地没劳力户按地多少适当付出工资。四、事先要科学的测量，精确的计算工程，作好一切准备工作。要精确的测量出动多少土方，计算出用工多少，通知区村调动民力，带多少食粮，同时工具也要准备好，否则稍一粗心，浪费民力甚大。当时对干部的要求是：“干部多费一点心，群众得利数不清。”五、要在统一计划，统一领导下进行，克服“村本位”等不良倾向，有关的县与县之间，也必须协同动作，以免温县修了河，把水送到武陟，又使武陟受淹。
