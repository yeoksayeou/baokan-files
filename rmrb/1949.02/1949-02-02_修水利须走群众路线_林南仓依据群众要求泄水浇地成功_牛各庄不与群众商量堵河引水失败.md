[Jidong Dispatch] The Jidong Administrative Office's water conservancy symposium pointed out that the success of Lin Nancang's three depressions in Yutian County in releasing water for irrigation and the failure of Niu Gezhuang's blocking of the river for water diversion are the different results of two different leadership styles. In recent years, the Jiyun Riverbed has become silted up, and the accumulated water in the three depressions of Lin Nancang, Taihe, and Sihui in the county cannot be discharged. Over 100,000 mu of land have not yielded a harvest for seven or eight years. The masses in the waterlogged areas demanded that the water be released. Last year, the area experienced a severe autumn drought. Except for the waterlogged depressions, a large amount of land in the county was dry, and the masses needed water for irrigation to prepare for planting spring wheat and early-maturing autumn crops this spring. According to the demands of the masses, the county leadership seized the opportunity to combine the release of water from the depressions with the diversion of water for irrigation. In early October, thirty-five *gu* (i.e., drainage outlets dug in the river堤) were opened along the Jiyun, Ronghui, Shuangcheng, and other rivers, allowing the accumulated water in the depressions to be discharged into the dry land through the rivers from the *gu* outlets. It only cost 7,372 workdays and took two months to release water from 123,427 mu of waterlogged land, irrigating 96,666 mu of dry land, which is estimated to increase grain production by more than 10 million *jin*. The completion of this project has been enthusiastically supported by the masses. In addition, the Niu Gezhuang village on the west bank of the Haihe River in the eastern part of the county failed in its attempt to block the river for water diversion because it did not follow the mass line and the cadres made subjective decisions. The area is a wheat-producing region. In order to increase the wheat planting area, the leadership decided to carry out water conservancy work. In late October, cadres were sent to the area to inspect the terrain and formulate a plan, and a joint meeting of village cadres was convened. Without in-depth investigation to understand the actual situation and solicit opinions from the masses, they only emphasized the need to improve agricultural production. The masses reluctantly "accepted" the plan, and work began. The 11-*zhang* wide and 2.5-*chi* deep riverbed was blocked with a dam, and two 2.5-*zhang* wide, 4-*chi* deep, and 60-*zhang* long irrigation canals were dug on the west side of the river. However, the ground was 6 *chi* higher than the water surface, and the water had to be raised by 7 *chi* to be diverted for irrigation. After more than half a month, the dam was breached twice when the water rose to 4.5 *chi*. Later, the time approached "Minor Snow," and the weather turned cold. Even if the dam was rebuilt, the water would freeze when released. The work of blocking the river for irrigation completely failed. In addition to the loss of a large amount of timber, the cost of labor was also lost, amounting to 29,450 *jin* of millet.

　　修水利须走群众路线
    林南仓依据群众要求泄水浇地成功
    牛各庄不与群众商量堵河引水失败
    【冀东电】冀东行署水利座谈会上指出，玉田县林南仓三洼泄水浇地的成功与牛各庄堵河引水的失败，是两种不同领导作风所得的不同结果。近年蓟运河床淤高，该县林南仓、太和、四会三个洼积水不能泄出，十余万亩土地，七、八年来未得收获，水地群众要求把水泄出。去年该地秋旱，除水洼外，全县大量地干，群众需要用水浇地，以备今春播种春麦和早熟秋田。该县领导上根据群众要求，抓紧时机，把水洼泄水与引水浇地结合起来，于十月初沿蓟运、荣辉、双城等河上开沽三十五个（沽即是在河堤上挖开的泄水口），使各洼积水通过河流，由沽口泄入干地。仅费工七千三百七十二个，历时两月即泄出水地十二万三千四百二十七亩，灌溉干地九万六千六百六十六亩，估计可增产粮食一千余万斤。这一工程完成，获得群众热烈拥护。另外该县东部还乡河西岸牛各庄村堵河引水浇地，由于未走群众路线，干部主观决定，遭到惨痛失败。该地为产麦区，领导上为了增加种麦面积，决定开展水利工作，于十月下旬派干部到该地视察地势，并订出计划，召开村干部联席会。未经深入调查了解实际情况，征求群众意见，只强调要把农业生产提高一步，群众勉强“接受”了，开始工作。把宽十一丈、深二尺五寸的河身用坝堵死，于河西挖宽二丈五尺，深四尺，长六十丈，引水渠两道。但地面高于水面六尺，须蹩起七尺水，才能引水灌溉。经半个多月时间，两次合垄，水涨到四尺五寸，结果将坝冲坏。后时令将近“小雪”，天气转寒，即使搭好，放水时也要结冰，堵河灌溉工作完全失败。除损失大批木材外，尚失损人工费用小米二万九千四百五十斤。
