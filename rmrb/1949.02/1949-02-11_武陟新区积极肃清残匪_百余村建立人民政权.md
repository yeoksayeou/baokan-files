[Taixing News] Since the beginning of December last year, villages in the Wuzhi New District have launched a mass movement to eliminate the remaining bandit and puppet forces, actively investigating hidden bandits and puppets, and investigating bandit and puppet weapons. When villagers in the Sixth District met, they would ask each other: Has so-and-so in your village handed over their gun? Conscious farmers have established their own organizations. As of January 10th, out of 133 administrative villages in the New District, 100 administrative villages had established farmers' associations, with more than 6,500 people participating. Ninety-five administrative villages have formed militia groups. Nearly a thousand young adults have taken up hundreds of rifles, curved guns, and grenades to maintain local security. Self-defense forces have been established in villages fairly universally. With their own armed forces, the masses have straightened their backs. Consequently, 110 administrative villages have abolished the Baojia system and established their own new people's political power. The farmers' association and militia in Erpuying and Xiwu villages discussed every night who hadn't handed over their guns. Active members in Qin Village said: "In the past, we thought we were getting guns for the district cadres, but now we know we're getting them for ourselves!" The Baofeng joint defense team previously believed that there were no hidden guns, but as a result, they also found 15 rifles. Under the power of the active actions of the broad masses and the appeal of our lenient policy, the remaining bandit and puppet personnel have also begun to differentiate. For example, Zhang Taishi (who once served as the puppet township self-defense captain) and Huang Guoxiong (who once served as a miscellaneous division captain) in Erpuying both requested to perform meritorious service to atone for their crimes. In addition to the more than 1,400 people who had already registered in the past, each district still has many people who voluntarily registered. In this period, more than 200 rifles and pistols were handed over, and more than 300 guns were still missing. The following are some of the main experiences in achieving this success:

　　First, widespread and in-depth publicity of current affairs policies was carried out, which encouraged the broad masses and dispelled doubts. Second, farmers in the New District were trained extensively, with more than 3,000 poor farmers being trained. Their awareness has been raised, and they are demanding to organize forces, seize guns, and control power. Third, bandit and miscellaneous personnel were trained, pointing out the future, and beginning to differentiate them. After training, many people expressed their willingness to perform meritorious service to atone for their crimes. After this period of work, the enthusiasm of the masses in the New District to support production and the front lines has increased. Sixty-six households in Heyang and Baofeng invested eight dan of grain to open an oil mill. Farmers in Xizhongxu said: In the past, people in our village were afraid and did not dare to produce, but now the rice bowl is in our hands. Twenty new oil dyeing sundries and pharmacies have been added in ten villages including Houyangcheng in the Fifth District, and carrying loads for transportation is very common. Zhou Xuexian, a 65-year-old poor peasant in Qian Gaozhuang, also voluntarily went to carry a stretcher, and carried it all the way to Jiaozuo without changing people.

　　武陟新区积极肃清残匪
  　百余村建立人民政权
    【太行讯】年前十二月初以来，武陟新区各村展开了群众性的肃清匪伪残余势力运动，积极清查暗藏匪伪，清查匪伪武器。六区群众见了面就要相互问问：你村谁谁的枪交了没有？有了觉悟的农民，已建立了自己的组织。至一月十日，新区一百三十三个行政村，已经有一百个行政村建立了农会，参加农会的六千五百余人。九十五个行政村成立了民兵。近千人的青壮年拿起数百支步枪、曲枪、手榴弹，维护地方治安。各村相当普遍的成立了自卫队，群众有了自己的武装，腰直起来了。因之，一百一十个行政村取消了保甲制度，建立了人民自己的新政权。二铺营和西仵村农会民兵每天夜间讨论谁的枪还没交。钦村的积极分子说：“过去以为是给区干部搞枪哩，现在知道了，是给咱自己搞哩！”豹峰联防曾认为是没有暗枪的，结果也搞出十五支步枪。在广大群众积极行动的威力和我们宽大政策的感召下，匪伪残余人员亦起了分化。如二铺营张太实（曾经干过伪乡镇自卫队长）和黄国雄（曾干过杂牌分队长），都要求立功赎罪。各区除过去已经登记之一千四百余人外，尚有不少人自动登记。这一段又交出步枪手枪二百余支，缺枪三百余支。取得这样成绩，有以下几个主要经验：
    一是普遍深入的进行了时事政策宣传，鼓舞了广大群众，解除了疑虑。二是新区普遍训练了农民，受训贫苦农民达三千以上。他们觉悟提高了，要求组织力量，掌握枪杆，掌握印把。三是对匪杂人员经过了训练，指出前途，开始分化。不少人受训后，表示愿意立功赎罪。经过这段工作，新区群众生产支前的热情提高了。和杨豹峰六十六户，入股粮食八石开油房。西仲许农民说：以前俺村人害怕，不敢生产，现在饭碗已经到咱手了。五区后阳城等十个村新增油染杂货药铺二十余座，担挑运输的很普遍。前高庄六十五岁的贫农周学贤老汉也自动去抬担架，一直抬到焦作不换人。
