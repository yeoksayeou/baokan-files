　　Several Opinions on the Current Secondary Education
    　　Guidance Office of the Education Department of the North China People's Government
    　　　　(I) Achievements since the North China Education Conference
    Since the North China Secondary Education Conference, each district has convened secondary education conferences to convey arrangements and organize implementation, and all schools have made significant progress and taken on a new look.

    First, cultural learning has been strengthened, and formal systems and educational plans have been established. Generally, class reorganization has been carried out, and teaching is conducted according to the prescribed teaching hours for each subject. Schools without textbooks strive to provide lecture notes, assign extracurricular homework with guidance, and establish subject research groups to guide students in self-study. Systems and covenants have been established for student status, attendance, testing, and living and learning. Some regions have also formulated unified curriculum standards and teaching schedules. Individual schools have conducted experiments to improve teaching methods. All schools have paid attention to enriching teaching equipment. Some schools collect specimens themselves and make some instruments. Some schools, even without experimental instruments, have added charts of plant and animal physiology and hygiene. Some schools have a basic set of instruments, and chemistry experiments in individual junior high schools are basically no longer a problem, greatly exceeding the level during the enemy and puppet regime.

    In improving political and ideological education, excessive political classes and social activities have generally been reduced. The rigid, dogmatic teaching methods are being changed, attention is paid to linking with reality, the method of tracking down thoughts has been abolished, attention is paid to guidance and enlightenment, and leading by example. Therefore, political and ideological education has also achieved certain results during this period. The newly liberated areas are particularly evident, and students are closer to our party. Their understanding of our party has been basically liberated from the malicious propaganda of the enemy in the past.

    All parties are very satisfied with the new policy. Students feel that they are gaining more knowledge now, their interest has increased, they are studying seriously, and their progress is quite rapid. Absenteeism, lateness, and early departure are gradually decreasing, and the learning effect has greatly improved. Teachers feel that the policy is clear and specific, the curriculum has standards, the administration has systems, and the career has a future. Their interest and confidence have greatly increased, they prepare lessons carefully, make long-term plans, and demonstrate a high degree of work enthusiasm, conscientiousness, and mental well-being. Parents are also satisfied, feeling that their children can now read and learn skills. The prestige of the school has greatly increased, and all parties have changed their understanding of the school.

    In short, since the North China Secondary Education Conference, secondary schools have basically laid the foundation for implementing formal education in the future by overcoming past biases and chaos, establishing various systems, strengthening cultural learning, improving political and ideological education, and improving the quality of schools. Although the time has been short, the achievements are not small. Only individual areas have poor leadership with laissez-faire phenomena and have achieved less.

    　　　　(II) Current Problems
    A. In terms of implementation principles:

    First, there is a certain degree of blindness in strengthening cultural learning. Some schools complete tasks without considering whether students can digest the material in order to catch up with the curriculum progress standards. Some schools subjectively feel that students' mathematics and science levels are low and blindly increase the number of mathematics and science hours. There is a lack of organic coordination in the teaching of each subject, and there is a phenomenon of each going its own way in assigning extracurricular homework without an overall plan. Students feel that the burden is heavy. On the other hand, a few schools are beginning to attach importance to cultural learning, but the responsible comrades in some schools study and improve the many problems existing in teaching less.

    Second, in terms of political and ideological education: the main problem is the lack of overall concrete research and planning in practice. There is a view that cultural learning and political and ideological education are opposed to each other, and there is a particular ambiguity about conducting ideological education through relevant courses. Although there are many social activities, they are mostly passive. Secondly, individual schools have a certain degree of relaxation in political and ideological education, such as: life review meetings sometimes fall into laissez-faire or become a formality.

    Third, after emphasizing the importance of classroom teaching and teacher guidance, many teachers are more concerned about increasing the number of teaching hours and less concerned about whether students have sufficient time for previewing and reviewing. After emphasizing individual learning, some schools have simply cancelled the necessary group meetings. In arranging the content of some self-study, attention is paid to striving for balanced development of each subject, but not enough attention is paid to developing individuality at a certain balanced level. Less use is made of ideological enlightenment to promote students' learning, and more organizational methods are adopted, so students' awareness and initiative in learning is very poor.

    Fourth, paying attention to hygiene and exercising to maintain a healthy body is a problem that all schools generally lack clear attention to. Therefore, those restricted by financial difficulties cannot do it, and some who can do it have not paid attention to research and implementation. There are trachoma, scabies, and gastrointestinal diseases in all schools, and some schools have a large number of sick students.

    B. Several specific problems:

    First, teachers and students are generally caught in a state of busyness and chaos: on the teachers' side, the reason is that some schools carry out the integration of running schools and teaching with a considerable degree of blindness. The tasks of the teaching affairs office, general affairs office, and grade teachers are unclear, and the division of labor is unclear, so they all cannot but be busy and chaotic in clericalism. The work system and work methods are also not scientific and reasonable, and there are still many meetings. Compiling teaching materials without textbooks is the most time-consuming. Preparing lessons is also a big problem. Teachers with poor foundations or new teachers must spend more time, and those with good levels also have to prepare fully because students have high requirements and they want to teach well. There is a lot of extracurricular homework. There are also many extracurricular activities to guide. The reasons for students' busyness are: cultural classes have increased. There are also many extracurricular activities. Students who hold many concurrent positions in the student union are greatly affected in their learning. Students with poor levels naturally feel strenuous. Students who live at school waste a lot of time on commuting.

    Second, regarding teaching materials, the first big problem is that many courses still have no textbooks and no curriculum preparation. The most difficult of these is that the teaching materials for education have no direction. The current normal schools are actually no different from middle schools, with only two more hours of education class per week, and the content of these two hours of class is also lacking in research. Reference books and teaching books for each subject are generally lacking, which is very inconvenient for teaching.

    Third, regarding funding and equipment: some middle schools still have no school buildings and occupy civilian houses. Books, instruments, etc. are generally very lacking, and the equipment in all aspects of the school is very poor. After the land reform, the composition of students in various schools has changed greatly, and the children of the working people have greatly increased, accounting for about 70% to 80%. Due to economic constraints, they cannot live at school, so there are particularly many day students in urban schools, which greatly affects learning.

    Fourth, regarding the issue of teachers: there are very few sources of teachers, and adjustments are quite difficult. Generally speaking, the political level of teachers in the new areas needs to be improved, and the cultural level of teachers in the old areas needs to be improved. From the perspective of curriculum categories, political and educational teachers are the most lacking. Teaching methods generally adopt the past ones, and some are not even proficient in the old methods. In order to further improve the teaching effect, teaching methods must also be improved. In short, the quantity and quality of teachers are issues that deserve great attention in the future.

    Fifth, after the reorganization of classes, because not enough attention was paid to culture during the past enrollment, there is still a very large disparity in the level of each class. Among them, the one-year class, although older in age, has a poorer cultural foundation and still cannot adapt to the current urgent needs of work. Three-year students are still unable to be transferred.

    　　　　(III) Several Opinions for the Future
    First, it is necessary to clarify educational ideology, strengthen planning and organization in work, and improve administrative leadership: what ideas need to be clarified in teaching work?

    From the teaching perspective:

    It must be clear that the teaching plan and the teaching effect are unified. The determination of the key points and amount of teaching materials should be based on the students' (especially the majority of middle-level students') ability to accept them, rather than taking the level that individuals think should be or the pre-war school's level as the standard. Coupled with the view of completing the plan, subjectively setting the level standard for students makes the content of teaching materials, teaching progress, and students' ability to accept them disconnected.

    It must be clear that teaching and practice cannot be separated, and teaching and application are unified. The content of lectures must be linked to reality. For example, when teaching physics and chemistry, more use should be made of indigenous methods and experiments. More use should be made of problems in actual life to explain, so that students can understand and apply them to actual practice after learning. This can also overcome some difficulties of not having experimental instruments. When teaching political classes, attention should also be paid to linking to reality, so that students not only have a conceptual understanding, but also improve in terms of ideology.

    It must be clear that our educational goal is to cultivate young people with "good character" and "good learning" who are healthy in body. Cultural learning, political and ideological education, and physical exercise are all-round development. Therefore, cultural learning, political and ideological education, and physical exercise should not be neglected. At present, neglecting hygiene and physical exercise is the most serious, and must be given great attention. Active exercise should be carried out. Efforts should be made in many ways to improve students' health, such as improving the management of meals, not allowing students to breathe in chalk dust, reducing the chance of disease transmission, and setting up more washbasins for boarding students to avoid eye diseases or other epidemics. This aspect should be included as one of the inspection items when checking work.

    From the learning perspective:

    It must be clear that in order to achieve the greatest effect from learning, in addition to the guiding role of teachers, attention must be paid to stimulating students' ideological awareness, so that students can consciously and automatically improve their interest, work hard actively, study in depth, and maintain balanced development in each subject, rather than the teacher's guidance being disconnected from the students' ideological awareness, and students being completely passive, being pushed and moved, and doing whatever they are told.

    It must be clear that the purpose of the exam must be consistent with the effect of the exam. The purpose of the exam is to promote students' learning, summarize and improve learning, and check the learning effect, playing an active role in promoting the actual improvement of learning. It should not be that the purpose is only to look at the score, and students memorize by rote for the score, and do not thoroughly understand what they have learned, which is examining for the sake of examining.

    In short, we must correct the subjectivism, dogmatism, and empiricism that are divorced from reality in our educational ideology.

    The second issue in improving teaching work is to strengthen planning and organization:

    In teaching, it is necessary to have a plan based on students' ability to accept them, determine the amount, depth, key points of teaching materials, and what should be streamlined and discarded. In political and ideological education: students' revolutionary views, mass views, labor views, and a certain ability to work, how to complete them step by step through political classes, related courses, social services and other aspects within the prescribed period of study, must have a plan. Which extracurricular homework should be assigned, how much should be assigned, how to arrange the time evenly so that students do not feel too heavy or too crowded, must have a plan and organization. Students' learning must also have a plan. Teachers should provide concrete guidance. Regular classes and extracurricular reading are all included in the plan. Which subject each person is weak in, auxiliary methods should be formulated. Some students, after formulating a learning plan, feel that there are more books and the homework is not tight, preventing the phenomenon of imbalance in each subject and taking the initiative in learning. In addition to individual learning methods, voluntary cooperation and mutual assistance are possible, and the necessary group discussions must also be carried out. However, the current group meetings have little time and high requirements. How to use group meetings for learning must also have a plan and organization. In short, all our work should be carried out with planning and organization.

    In terms of improving administrative leadership: some schools must seriously overcome chaotic and irregular phenomena. The teaching affairs office, general affairs office, and grade teachers must clarify the division of labor. Adjusting and allocating cadres should not adopt a passive and laissez-faire waiting attitude. Each department should give full play to its role in accordance with its name. Anything that affects students' learning and teachers' teaching should not be asked of them. It is necessary to establish regular work. It is necessary to study scientific and reasonable work systems and overcome clericalism. Unnecessary meetings should be cancelled, redundant meetings should be merged, and meetings should be prepared, which saves time and improves work efficiency. The unsoundness of the administrative leadership part has a great impact on teaching, and great efforts must be made to improve it.

    　　　　(IV) Several Specific Problems
    Regarding the establishment and distribution of schools: each administrative office should make long-term plans and consider them comprehensively. For the convenience of transportation and equipment, some schools can be moved to the county seat (of course, it also depends on the specific situation, such as if there is no school building in the city, but the school building outside the city is very good, or if the school building is not far from the city and is also good, then the school does not need to be moved).

    Regarding the school system and class reorganization: we must give enough importance to the one-year system. It is wrong to regard it as a reception team. In order to meet the needs of work, the one-year system will continue to be run in the future. The curriculum focuses on reading, writing, and arithmetic. Its level cannot be lower than the first grade of the three-year system, otherwise the problem cannot be solved. Secondly, for classes that have been reorganized in the past, those with too much disparity should be further appropriately adjusted with the middle level in a class as the standard.

    Regarding teaching materials and curriculum: how to deal with the current education curriculum without teaching materials? For classes that will not graduate immediately, the education class can be moved to the last grade to teach, and teaching materials may have been compiled by then. For classes that are about to graduate, elementary school teaching materials, teaching methods, and practical problems of national education can be studied. The content of practical problems of national education can be a summary of the relevant part of the educational work of the administrative office, special districts, and counties (such as how to mobilize students to enroll, how to make students interested, how to establish good relations with village cadres, etc.). Some areas have done this, and facts have proved that it is of great practical help to teachers. Secondly, for the content standards of the three-year political class recently promulgated, for the old areas where classes are about to graduate, for the parts that cannot be completed, some comprehensive reports can be organized to give a brief education. A more detailed understanding can only be solved in work or continued study, and there is no need to extend the study time for this. In terms of curriculum, if students in the city are willing to learn abacus calculation, each school can set up elective courses, and it is not necessary to list them as compulsory courses, because some have already learned them in senior primary school.

    Regarding the improvement of teachers' quality: in addition to generally strengthening on-the-job learning and using vacations to summarize experience, teachers with poor quality who can be adjusted should be adjusted. They should also be sent to schools to be trained and improved in a planned way, and then go to work in schools after they have been improved. Secondly, the work of improving the quality of teachers should also be carried out with key points and objects. When carrying it out, the main thing should be to concentrate efforts to improve one subject, learn what you teach, and learn what you don't know. The school itself is an educational institution, and has special convenient conditions for learning. Teachers can also listen to classes with students at any time. Establish learning mutual assistance among teachers. There are many methods, and I hope everyone will create more.

　　对目前中等教育的几点意见
    华北人民政府教育部辅导室
    　　　　（一）华北教育会议后所获成绩
    华北中等教育会议以后，各区均召开了中等教育会议，传达布置，组织实施，各学校均有了显著进步，有了新气象。
    首先加强了文化学习，建立了正规制度与教育计划。一般均进行了班级整顿，根据规定的各科教学时数进行教学。无课本者争取有讲义笔记，留课外作业并有指导，成立了各科研究小组，辅导学生自习。建立了学籍，考勤，测验，生活学习等制度与公约。有的地区并自订了统一的课程标准、教学进度。个别学校进行了改进教学法的试验。各学校都注意了充实教学设备。有的学校自己采集标本并自制了些仪器。有的学校虽无实验仪器也添置了动植物生理卫生挂图，有的已有了部分仪器，个别学校初中化学实验基本上已不成问题，并大大超过敌伪时代。
    在政治思想教育的改进上，普遍都减少了过多的政治课及社会活动。改变着生硬的教条讲授方法，注意联系实际，取消了追查思想的办法，注意诱导启发，以身作则。所以这个时期政治思想教育也是收到了一定的成效。新解放区表现得特别明显，学生和我党更加靠近，对于我党的认识，已从过去敌人的恶意宣传中毒中基本上得到解放。
    各方对新方针甚表满意。学生觉现在得知识多，兴趣提高，学习认真，进步颇快，矿课迟到早退逐渐减少，学习效果大大提高，教员觉方针明确具体，课程有标准，行政有制度，事业有前途，兴趣信心大大提高，认真准备课，做长期打算，表现了高度的工作热忱，兢兢业业，精神愉快。家长亦均满意，感觉现在能读书学得本领。学校威信大大提高，各方面对学校的认识均有了改变。
    总之，华北中等教育会议以后，各中等学校在克服过去的偏向混乱，建立各种制度，加强文化学习，改进政治思想教育，提高学校质量，基本上已打下了今后实行正规教育的基础。虽为时不长，成绩是不小的。仅个别地区领导上有自流现象，成绩较差。
    　　　　（二）目前存在的问题
    甲、在实施原则方面：
    其一、在加强文化学习上，存在有某种程度的盲目性。有的学校为了赶课程进度标准，不顾学生能否消化，去完成任务。有的学校主观上感觉学生数理水平低，盲目增加数理时数。各科教学缺乏有机配合，留课外作业无通盘计划，有各自为政现象。学生感觉负担重。另方面，少数学校重视文化学习应是开始，有的学校负责同志，对教学上存在之许多问题研究改进较少。
    其二、在政治思想教育方面：主要是做法上缺乏整个具体研究与计划。有文化学习与政治思想教育对立的看法，对通过有关课程进行思想教育一点特别模糊。社会活动虽不少，但多系被动。其次，个别学校对政治思想教育有某种程度的放松，如：生活检讨会有的陷于自流或流于形式。
    其三、在提出重视课堂教学及教师辅导作用以后，不少的教员同志对增加授课时数关心较多，对学生预习复习时间充分与否则注意较少。着重个人学习以后，有的学校则根本取消了应有的小组会。排定部分自习的内容，注意争取各科平衡发展，但对于在一定平衡水平上发展个性则注意不够。对于学生学习的推动运用思想启发较少，采取组织方法较多，学生学习上的自觉与主动是很差的。
    其四、注意卫生，锻炼健康身体，是各学校普遍缺乏明确注意的问题。所以，受财经困难限制者固做不到，有的可做到者亦未注意研究执行。各学校中均有沙眼、疥疮、肠胃病等，有的学校病号数量不少。
    乙、几个具体问题：
    其一、教员与学生普遍陷于忙乱：在教员方面，其原因是有的学校带着相当的盲目性去执行大家办学教导合一。教导处、总务处、级任教员任务不明，分工不清，因此都不能不在事务主义中忙乱。工作制度与工作方法有的亦欠科学合理，会议仍不少。无课本编教材最费时间。准备课亦是大问题，教员根底差者或新教员固须多费时间，程度好者亦因学生要求高，自己想教好而不能不充分准备。课外作业非常多。指导课外活动亦不少。学生忙的原因是：文化课加重了。课外活动亦不少。学生会兼差多的，学习受影响自大。通宿学生时间不少浪费在走路上。程度差的自然觉得吃力。
    其二，关于教材，首先是许多课程尚无课本又无课程准备，是大问题。其中最困难的是教育教材毫无着落。现师范学校实际与中学无大差异，每周只多两小时教育课，而这两小时课的内容又是缺乏研究。各科参考书，教授书普遍缺乏，对教学十分不便。
    其三，关于经费设备：有的中学仍无校址，占用民房。图书仪器等一般都很缺乏，学校各方设备均很差。土地改革后各校学生成份起了很大变化，劳动人民子弟大大增加，约均占百分之七十至八十，因经济能力限制不能住宿，故城市学校走读生特别多，影响学习颇大。
    其四，关于师资问题：教员来源很少，调整颇感困难，一般的看，新区教员政治水平须加提高，老区教员文化水平须加提高。从课程门类上看，以政治和教育教员最感缺乏。教学方法一般均系采用过去的，有的连旧的方法也不熟练。为了进一步提高教学效果，教授法亦须加以改进。总之，教师的数量与质量都是今后值得十分加以注意的问题。
    其五，班级经过整编后，因过去招生时对文化上注意不够，故每班程度上仍有很悬殊现象。其中一年制班，年龄虽大，但文化基础较差，仍不能适应目前工作急需。三年制学生仍不能受到调动。
    　　　　（三）今后的几点意见
    首先，要明确教导思想，加强工作中的计划性组织性，健全行政领导：在教导工作上有那些思想须加明确？
    从教的方面看：
    要明确：教学计划与教学效果是统一的。确定教材重点分量，应根据学生（特别是大多数中等程度的）接受能力。而不是个人认为应有的或战前学校的程度为标准。加上完成计划观点，主观的给学生定程度标准，使教材内容、教学进度与学生接受能力脱节。
    要明确：教学与实际不能脱节，教与应用是统一的。授课内容必须联系实际。如：讲理化应多采土法实验。多用实际生活中问题加以说明，使学生学了以后，能了解实际用于实际。又可克服一些无实验仪器的困难。讲政治课也要注意联系实际。使学生不仅有概念上的了解，并且从思想实际上也得到提高。
    要明确：我们的教育目标，是培养“品”“学”兼优身体健康的青年。文化学习，政治思想教育，身体锻炼三者是全面发展的。因此，对文化学习，政治思想教育以及身体的锻炼，均不能有所忽视。目前以忽视卫生锻炼身体为最严重，必须引起极大注意。要进行积极的锻炼。要从多方面设法以增进学生的健康。如改善伙食的管理，不要使粉笔面都叫学生呼吸到肺中去，要减少疾病传染的机会，住宿生要多设置洗脸盆以免眼病或其他病疫。在检查工作时，这方面应列为检查项目之一。
    在学的方面：
    要明确：要使学习得到最大的效果，除了教师的指导作用以外就必须注意启发学生的思想自觉。使学生自觉自动的提高兴趣，积极努力，深入研究，保持各科平衡发展。而不是教师的指导与学生的思想自觉脱节，学生完全处于被动的地位，推推动动，叫怎样才怎样。
    要明确：考试的目的与考试的效果必须一致。考试的目的是：推动学生学习，总结与提高学习和检查学习效果，对学习的实际提高起积极推动作用。不应该目的只是看分数，学生为分数死背死记，对于学过的东西，并不融会贯通彻底了解，这是为考试而考试。
    总之我们教导思想中脱离实际的主观主义，教条主义，和经验主义都必须加以纠正。
    提高教导工作的第二个问题是加强计划性组织性：
    在教学方面，根据学生接受能力，确定教材之多少深浅，重点，何者应精简取舍，必须有计划。在政治思想教育方面：学生的革命观点，群众观点，劳动观点，以及一定的工作能力，在规定的修业期限内，如何有步骤的通过政治课及有关课程，社会服务等多方面去完成，必须有计划。课外作业何者应留，留多少，时间如何排均匀，使学生觉得不重又不挤，必须有计划，有组织。学生学习也要有计划。教师应做具体指导。正课，课外阅读全包括计划中去，每人那门差，应订出辅助办法，有些学生订了学习计划以后，觉着书多了，功课不觉紧了，防止了各科不平衡现象，学习操得了主动。个人的学习方法以外，自愿的合作互助是可以有的，应有的小组讨论也必须进行。但现在的小组会是时间少要求高，如何利用小组会进行学习，亦必须有计划，有组织。总之我们的一切工作，应该是在有计划有组织上下去进行。
    在健全行政领导方面：有些学校必须认真克服混乱不正规现象。教导总务级任教员要明确分工。调整配备干部不要采取消极自流的等待态度。各部门应名实相符的充分发挥其作用。凡足以影响学生学习教员教学者，不应叫他们去做。要建立经常工作。要研究科学合理的工作制度，克服事务主义。不必要的会议应取消，重复的合并，会议应有准备，既节省时间又提高工作效率。行政领导部分的不健全对教学影响颇大，必须大力设法改进。
    　　　　（四）几个具体问题
    关于学校的设置分布：各行署应作长期打算，通盘加以考虑。为了交通设备等便利计，有些学校可移至县城内，（当然也要看具体情形，如城内无校舍，城外校舍很好，或离城不远校舍亦不错时，学校即不必迁移。）
    关于学制与班级整顿：我们对一年制必须有足够的重视。视其为收容队是不对的。为适应工作需要，今后一年制仍续办。课程着重读写算。其程度不能低于三年制之第一年级，否则不能解决问题。其次，各校过去整顿过之班级，其悬殊太甚者，应以一班中之中等程度为标准，进一步适当调整。
    关于教材与课程：目前教育课程无教材者如何处理？非立即毕业之班次，可将教育课移至最后年级去教，届时教材可能已编出。行将毕业之班次，可将小学教材教学法及国民教育实际问题加以研究。国民教育实际问题的内容，讲行署专、县教育工作有关这一部分的总结即可，（如怎么动员学生入学，如何可以使学生有兴趣，如何与村干建立良好关系…………等）。有的地区已如此进行，事实证明，对教员实际帮助甚大。其次，最近颁布之三年政治课内容标准，老区凡行将毕业之班次，对其不能学完之部分，可组织一些综合报告，予以简要之教育。更详细的了解只有留待工作中或续学中去解决，不必为此延长学习时间。在课程方面，城市学生中如有愿学珠算者，各学校可设选科，不必列为必修。因有的在高小已学过。
    关于教师的质量提高：除一般加强在职学习，利用假期总结经验外，对有些质量差的教员，能调整者应进行调整。并有计划的送入学校加以培养提高，提高后再到学校工作。其次，在提高教员质量的工作中亦应有重点有对象的去进行。在进行时主要应是集中力量提高一门，自己教什么就学什么，不会什么学什么。学校本身是教育机关，对学习有特殊便利条件。教员亦可随时和学生一齐听课。在教员间建立学习互助。方法是多的，也希望大家多多创造。
