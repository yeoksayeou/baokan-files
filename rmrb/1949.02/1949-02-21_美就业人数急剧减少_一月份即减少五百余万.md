Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 19th. The number of employed people in the United States has decreased sharply. Even according to the greatly reduced estimate by the U.S. Census Bureau, the number of employed people in January of this year has dropped to 57.4 million, while in July of last year it was 61.6 million. This is a decrease of 5.2 million people. As for the number of unemployed people, the Bureau estimates that January saw only 800,000 more than December of last year. This is a result of classifying those who cannot find work and are not employed as "not in the labor force." Therefore, American economists admit that the true number of unemployed people is much higher, possibly approaching four or five million, rather than the officially stated 2.7 million.

　　美就业人数急剧减少
  　一月份即减少五百余万
    【新华社陕北十九日电】美国就业人数已急剧减少，即使据美国国情普查局大大缩小了的估计，今年一月份就业人数已降为五千七百四十万人，而去年七月则为六千一百六十万人。即减少了五百二十万人。至于失业人数，该局估计一月份比去年十二月份只多八十万人。这是由于把那些找不到工作而没有工作的人，列入了“没有劳动力”项目中的结果。因此，美国经济学家承认：真正的失业人数会高得多，可能接近四百或五百万人，而不是官方所说的二百七十万人。
