　　前后出大车十七万辆 (Shíqī wàn liàng)
　　170,000 Carts Provided
　　[Jizhong Electric] Following the completion of the first batch of transportation tasks to support the People's Liberation Army in the Tianjin-Beijing area, the people of Jizhong are now fully engaged in the second batch of transportation work. From January 1st to 15th, 84,964 double-horse carts and 380 wooden boats have transported 26,370,000 catties of grain and flour, 13,860,000 catties of firewood and grass, and 4,925,000 catties of oil, salt, dry vermicelli, cabbage, and pork to the Tianjin-Beijing area. Based on the experience of the first stage, the leadership of transportation scheduling has been particularly strengthened this time, with strong cadres dispatched to solve the difficulties of cart workers in a timely manner. Each team is equipped with doctors, veterinarians, and carpenters, and every five carts share an axle. Vehicles are organized and planned to advance in batches along different routes. Command stations, food and lodging supply stations, and signposts are set up along the main transportation lines. In order to reduce loading and unloading time and accelerate transportation efficiency, local governments have also purchased a large number of pockets for holding grain and flour. The Jizhong Administrative Office and the Eighth Administrative Office of Jizhong alone have prepared more than 103,000 pockets. Youths and adults from Renqiu, Qingxian, Dacheng and other counties along the Daqing River, Ziya River, and Canal, like accepting combat missions, dispatched 2,500 ice-breaking boats, and picked up ice guns and wooden hammers, bravely smashing and breaking the ice. Where the ice was thin, boats and ice guns were used to ram across; where the ice was thick, teams were formed to collectively break it. "If the People's Liberation Army can liberate Tianjin and Beiping, can't we open up the ice river?" This rhetorical question represents the heroic spirit of the icebreakers. On January 10th, a 65-li section of the Ziya River from Wangkou in Dacheng County to Ziyazhen was broken open by 2,800 civilian workers. By January 13th, more than 100 li of waterway on the Daqing River had also been opened for navigation. In two days, 38 boats carrying grain traveled east. Each large boat carries 100,000 catties, equivalent to 142 double-horse carts, and each small boat carries 30,000 catties, equivalent to 42 double-horse carts. In the first batch of grain transportation to supply the People's Liberation Army in the Tianjin-Beijing area before the new year, Jizhong had already dispatched 84,715 carts and contributed 1 million workdays of manpower and animal power in rice husking and flour milling. Adding this second batch of grain transportation task, the people of Jizhong have mobilized a total of 170,000 carts before and after. The completion of this great task is primarily due to the fact that the Party, government, military, and civilian leadership at all levels in Jizhong recognized and understood the victorious development of the Liberation War. Before the start of the Tianjin-Beijing Campaign, they universally carried out mobilization and organization work to support the People's Liberation Army. On this basis, the people's political consciousness has been generally improved. Therefore, they have demonstrated a high degree of initiative and enthusiasm in their practical actions.

　　冀中人民支援平津前线
  　前后出大车十七万辆
    【冀中电】冀中人民继年前完成第一批支援平津地区人民解放军的运输任务后，又全力进行第二批运输工作。从一月一日开始到十五日，已有双套大车八万四千九百六十四辆，木船三百八十只，载运粮米、白面二千六百卅七万斤，柴草一千三百八十六万斤，油、盐、干粉、白菜、猪肉等四百九十二万五千斤。运往平津地区。根据第一阶段工作经验，这次特别加强了运输调度工作的领导，派遣坚强干部，及时解决车工困难。每队都带有医生、兽医、木匠，五辆车合伙备带一根车轴。车辆都有组织有计划地分批分路前进，在主要的运输线路上都设有指挥站、食宿供给站，指路标等。为减少装卸时间，加速运输效率，各地政府并大量购置装盛粮面的口袋，仅冀中行署与冀中八专署即准备好了口袋十万三千余条。大清河、子牙河、运河沿岸的任邱、青县、大城等县青年和壮年，象接受战斗任务那样，出动破冰划子二千五百架，拿起凌枪、木榔头，奋勇地砸冰、破冰。冰薄的地方，用船和凌枪横冲，冰厚的地方排成队伍集体打。“解放军能解放天津、北平，咱们还不能打开冰河？”这个反问，就代表着破冰者们的英雄气概。一月十日，子牙河大城县之王口到子牙镇一段六十五里的冰河，就被二千八百个民工砸开了。而大清河截至一月十三日止也已有百余里水路通航。在两天中就有卅八只船载粮东行。大船每只载重十万斤，可抵双套大车一百四十二辆，小船载重三万斤，可抵双套大车四十二辆。按年前第一批运输粮食供应平津地区人民解放军时，冀中就已经出动大车八万四千七百一十五辆，并在碾米、磨面中出人力畜力达一百万个工。加上此次第二批运粮任务，冀中人民前后已出动大车达十七万辆。这一伟大任务的完成，首先是由于冀中党、政、军、民各级领导机关认识了解放战争的胜利发展形势，在平津战役开始前，便普遍地进行了支援人民解放军的动员工作和组织工作。在这个基础上，人民的政治觉悟普遍地提高了，因此，他们在实际行动中就表现出高度的自动性和积极性。
