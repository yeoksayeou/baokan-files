[Jinzhong Electric] Pingyao's urban and rural areas have a completely new look, and the masses are happily celebrating their first Spring Festival after liberation. In Pingyao city, the streets were cleaned up a few days before the Spring Festival, and street lights were added at night. On New Year's Eve, the whole city was brightly lit, and every household in the urban and rural areas posted new couplets. At dawn on New Year's Day, firecrackers went off continuously, and citizens and children in new clothes poured into the streets. Cadres from various streets visited and paid respects to the families of soldiers. Many villages held group celebrations in the morning and paid New Year's greetings to the families of soldiers, with gongs and drums filling the air, showing the boundless glory of the families of soldiers. In the group celebration venue in Dahui Village, a portrait of Chairman Mao was hung. An old farmer said as he walked towards the venue, "Going to wish our Chairman Mao a Happy New Year." The masses in both urban and rural areas said joyfully and excitedly, "This year is a good one. Last year, under the rule of the Second War Zone (referring to the Yan bandit), some ate sorghum, some ate bran and bean cakes, but this year, every family is eating dumplings." A farmer in Xiaocheng Village, Fifth District, wrote his own couplet: "The Liberation Army came in victory, to turn over and live a good life."

　　平遥人民
  　往年高粮糠面
  　今年白面饺子
    【晋中电】平遥城乡气象一新，群众欢渡解放后的第一个新春。平遥市内在春节前几天，各街道即打扫干净，夜晚添设路灯。除夕全市通家灯光辉煌，城乡家家张贴新对联。元旦黎明，鞭炮声连起，市民、儿童身着新衣涌现街头，各街干部出入军属家里拜年。许多村庄均在上午举行团拜与向军属拜年，锣鼓喧天，显示着军属无限的光荣。大会村在团拜的会场上，悬挂着毛主席像，一个老农民走向会场时，边走边说：“给咱毛主席拜年去”。城乡群众均欢腾鼓舞地说：“今年过的好，去年在二战区（指阎匪）统治下，有的吃高梁，有的吃糠面、豆饼，今年家家都吃上饺子了。”五区小城村一农民自己编写了一副对联：“胜利来了解放军，翻身要过好光景”。
