　　Jizhong Ninth Sub-district Completes Land Reform and Party Rectification
  　　Both Party and Mass Ranks Expanded
　　[Jizhong Electric] After more than three months of intense work, the Ninth Sub-district has completed land reform in 2,360 villages. Currently, 291 villages still have some loose ends regarding floating assets and land certificate issuance being cleared up. During the conclusion of land reform, the review of class status revealed that the phenomenon of elevating or lowering class status before the conclusion of land reform still existed in many areas. Not only were some peasants classified into the landlord and rich peasant categories, but some landlords and rich peasants were also classified into the peasant category, disrupting the class ranks. According to statistics from 39 villages in eight counties, 450 incorrectly classified households have been changed, of which 264 households had their status elevated and 186 households had their status lowered. The review and correction of class status strengthened the unity of the peasants. According to statistics from 174 villages in Anping, before the conclusion of land reform, landlords and rich peasants owned more land than poor and hired peasants. Compared with the average per capita landholding of each class, landlords had 4.2 percent more, rich peasants had 14.5 percent more, and poor peasants had 13.3 percent less. During this conclusion of land reform, a total of 15,150 mu of land was reasonably distributed. 4,618 poor peasant households received more than 80 percent of the land extracted, reaching an average of 3.64 mu per person, which is 94 percent of the overall average of 3.87 mu per person for all classes, adequately satisfying the land demands of the poor peasants. Middle peasants still maintained more land than the average per capita landholding of each class. Landlords and rich peasants also received land that was roughly equal to or not much different from that of ordinary peasants. In terms of floating assets and houses, according to statistics from 42 villages in ten counties, 3,853 brick houses, 1,036 adobe houses, and some bricks, tiles, and timber were confiscated and requisitioned from 592 landlord and feudal rich peasant households. In addition, there were 321.5 large carts, 136 waterwheels, 264.5 head of livestock, 5,071 pieces of farm equipment, and 56,322 pieces of clothing. In addition to reasonable distribution to the peasants, landlords and rich peasants were also appropriately resettled to enable them to engage in production. According to statistics from 37 villages in eight counties, 263 middle peasant households were encroached upon during land reform. During this conclusion of land reform, appropriate compensation was made to 230 households, totaling 23.5 large carts, 58.5 head of livestock, and 341 pieces of farm equipment. The unity between middle and poor peasants was strengthened by earnestly correcting policies. Throughout the entire process of concluding land reform, the ideology of Party members was generally rectified, criticism and self-criticism were carried out, the Party's rectification policy was correctly adhered to, the work enthusiasm of Party members and cadres was enhanced, the core leadership role of the branches was brought into play, and various organizations inside and outside the Party were improved and adjusted. According to statistics from 48 villages in ten counties, a total of 309 Party members were punished during land reform. After review, the punishment of 196 people who should not have been punished or were punished too severely was corrected. In order to further purify and discipline the Party ideologically, organizationally, and stylistically, 57 Party members who should have been punished but were not were dealt with differently according to the severity of their circumstances in accordance with the Party Constitution. Education for Party members was strengthened, and 238 poor peasant activists were admitted into the Party from the mass movement to conclude land reform, replenishing new strength. In terms of adjusting and expanding the ranks of the masses, 9,146 households out of 12,540 households in 47 villages participated in the peasants' association, accounting for 73 percent of the total number of households. There were a total of 23,529 members, of which 10,636 were women, accounting for 45 percent of the total number of members. A large number of new cadres were trained and promoted, the composition of cadres was adjusted, and the representative meetings were consolidated and improved. This played a decisive role in concluding land reform and supporting the front lines. In the process of concluding land reform, although great achievements were made, some detours were taken in the work, and some deviations occurred. At the beginning of the work, the idea that concluding land reform was the main task of winter work was not clear, and Party rectification was taken as the main problem. Therefore, Party rectification was carried out in isolation, ignoring the demands of the broad masses for concluding land reform, and the work took a detour. None of the 277 key villages in the entire sub-district were completed in more than 20 days from November 7th to the end of November. The fastest progress was made in distributing floating assets, and some were still stuck in the stage of understanding the situation. It was not until the implementation of the supplementary instructions of the District Party Committee on winter work that the work focused on concluding land reform and clarified that Party rectification must be completed before the Lunar New Year, which enabled the work to progress and gradually shift from key villages to comprehensive development. Secondly, due to the low policy level of cadres and the lack of policy learning and collective leadership, there were left-right swings in policy. For example, the compensation to middle peasants in Anguo Lijiazhuang exceeded the original wrongly moved objects. In one village in Anping, middle peasants who had been encroached upon were compensated nine times, harming the interests of poor peasants and forming unprincipled compensation; however, some who should have been compensated were not. In the extraction and compensation of land, some landlords in some villages still retained feudal property. In the late stage of concluding land reform, due to the approaching Spring Festival, there was a phenomenon of rushing to issue land certificates, ignoring the implementation of policies. Therefore, the elimination of feudalism in some villages formed a "half-cooked meal," such as in Zhongxinzhuang, Xinle, where some landlords still retained more land than poor peasants. The counties have now paid attention to this problem and organized mobile forces to conduct in-depth investigations and solve it in a timely manner.

　　冀中九分区完成土改整党
  　党群队伍皆有扩大
    【冀中电】九分区结束土地改革工作经过三个多月的紧张工作，现在全分区除二百九十一个村尚有些浮财及发土地证的尾巴正进行清理外，二千三百六十个村已全部完成结束土地改革工作。在结束土地改革中，经过审查成份证明：结束土地改革前，提高或降低成份的现象不少地区还存在着，不仅有的把农民划到地主、富农圈里，也有的把地主、富农划到农民圈里，混乱了阶级阵容。根据八个县三十九个村的统计，已改变了错订成份四百五十户，其中二百六十四户是提高成份的，一百八十六户是降低成份的。在审查改订成份中，加强了农民的团结。根据安平一百七十四个村的统计，结束土地改革前地主、富农占有较贫雇农为多的土地，与各阶层每人平均数相比较，地主多百分之四点二，富农多百分之十四点五，贫农则少百分之十三点三。这次结束土地改革时，共有一万五千一百五十亩土地作了合理地分配。四千六百一十八户贫农分得了占抽出数百分之八十以上的土地，达到每人平均三亩六分四，为各阶层每人总平均数三亩八分七的百分之九十四，适当地满足了贫农的土地要求。中农仍保持了较各阶层每人平均数为多的土地。地主、农富也得到了与一般农民相差不多或相等的土地。在浮财和房子方面，根据十个县四十二个村的统计，没收和征收了五百九十二户地主、封建富农的砖房三千八百五十三间，坯房一千零三十六间及一部砖瓦木料。另外还有大车三百二十一辆半，水车一百三十六辆，牲畜二百六十四头半，农县五千零七十一件，衣服五万六千三百二十二件。除农民作了合理分配外，并适当安置了地主富农，使其得以生产。根据八个县三十七个村的统计：土地改革时被侵犯的中农有二百六十三户，这次结束土地改革中，对二百三十户作了适当补偿，总计补偿了大车廿三辆半，牲口五十八头半，农具三百四十一件。从认真端正政策中加强了中贫农的团结。在整个结束土地改革的过程中，一般都初步整顿了党员思想，开展了批评与自我批评，正确坚持了整党方针，提高了党员干部工作积极性，发挥了支部核心领导作用，并健全调整了党内外的各种组织。据十个县四十八个村的统计：土地改革时共处分了党员三百零九人，这次经过审查后，对一百九十六个不该处分或处分过重的作了纠正。为了更进一步的从思想上、组织上、作风上纯洁和严肃党的纪律，对应处分而未处分的五十七个党员，根据党章按照情节轻重作了不同处理。加强了对党员的教育，并从结束土地改革的群众运动中，吸收了二百三十八个贫农积极分子入党，充实了新的力量。在调整与扩大群众队伍方面，四十七个村一万二千五百四十户中参加了农会的九千一百四十六户，占总户数的百分之七十三。会员共计二万三千五百二十九个，其中妇女会员有一万零六百三十六个，占会员总数的百分之四十五，并大批培养提拔了新干部，调整了干部成份，巩固健全了代表会。这在结束土地改革与支援前线任务中，都起了决定作用。在结束土地改革过程中，虽然获得了很大成绩，但工作上走了些弯路，发生了一些偏向。工作开始时，以结束土地改革为冬季工作主要任务的思想不明确，而将整党作为主要问题，因此孤立的进行整党，忽视了广大群众对结束土地改革的要求，工作上走了弯路。全分区二百七十七个重点村，从十一月七日开始到十一月底二十多天的时间，没有一个村作完。进行最快的开始分浮财，有的还陷在了解情况的阶段。直到贯彻了区党委关于冬季工作补充指示后，才以结束土地改革为主和明确须于旧历年前完成整党后，才使工作有了进展，逐渐由重点村转向了全面的发展。其次，由于干部政策水平低，缺乏政策学习与集体领导，在政策上发生了左右摇摆。如安国立家庄对中农的补偿超过了原来错动的物件。安平一个村对被侵犯的中农补偿了九次，妨害了贫农的利益，形成了无原则的补偿；但也有的应补偿者不补偿。在抽补土地上，有的村某些地主依然保留封建财产。在结束土地改革末期，由于春节将近，就产生了急于求成的单纯发土地证的现象，忽视了贯彻政策。所以有的村对封建的消灭上形成“夹生饭”，如新乐中辛庄某些地主还保持着比贫农为多的土地。现各县对此问题都引起了注意，并组织了机动力量，深入调查，及时解决。
