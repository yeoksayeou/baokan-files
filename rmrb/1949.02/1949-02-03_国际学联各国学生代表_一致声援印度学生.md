Electronegative News Agency, Prague Dispatch: Under the auspices of the International Student Union, representatives of democratic student movements from Czechoslovakia, China, Indonesia, Vietnam, Cyprus, Trieste, Albania, Arab countries, Bulgaria, Democratic Spain, the United States, Canada, the West Indies, Ecuador, and other countries held a conference in Prague on the 26th. They unanimously expressed their guarantee to support the struggle of Indian democratic students for complete independence.

The representative of the All-India Student Federation, Reddy, stated at the conference that the struggle of the Indian masses for genuine independence is continuing to grow despite the betrayal and barbaric suppression by the Nehru bourgeois government. Reddy then emphasized: "The liberation cause of the Chinese people has enlightened the revolutionary masses of India"; now, "even some police officers and progressive staff members of the middle class have joined the anti-persecution demonstrations of workers, peasants, and students."

Reddy reminded the audience that the Nehru authorities and the princely puppets of British imperialism have shown alarm because of this. The Nehru regime has brought fascist persecution to a new climax. Twelve Indian students were beaten to death by the police in January for participating in demonstrations expressing solidarity with the Indonesian people.

Reddy listed the anti-people acts committed by the Nehru government in the nine months since its so-called "independence": In Reddy's hometown of Andhra Pradesh alone, the police have attacked over a thousand villages and towns; burned 300 houses; raped 15 women; searched 10,000 homes; beaten 25,000 people; arrested and detained 5,000 people; and detained 250 democrats in concentration camps. Villages suspected of trade union activities and democratic activities are surrounded by dense military outposts. The concentration camps are inhumane. Hunger strikes have become a daily occurrence in the concentration camps.

　　国际学联各国学生代表
  　一致声援印度学生
    【新华社陕北卅一日电】电通社布拉格讯：在国际学联的主持之下，捷克斯洛伐克以及中国、印尼、越南、塞浦路斯、的里雅斯特、阿尔巴尼亚、阿拉伯、保加利亚、民主西班牙、美国、加拿大、西印度、厄瓜多尔等国民主学生运动的代表，于二十六日在布拉格举行大会，他们一致表示保证声援印度民主学生争取完全独立的斗争。全印学联代表雷狄在大会上发言称：印度群众为争取印度真正独立的斗争，正在不顾尼赫鲁资产阶级政府的出卖和野蛮镇压而继续地增长着。雷狄继而强调称：“中国人民的解放事业，启示了印度的革命群众”；现在，“甚至部分警察和中产阶层的进步职员，都参加了工人、农民和学生的反迫害示威”。雷狄提醒听众称：尼赫鲁当局和英帝国主义的王公傀儡们，已因此而显出惊恐。尼赫鲁政权已使法西斯迫害达到新的高潮。十二名印度学生已在一月间因参加表示与印尼人民休戚相关的示威游行而被警察打死。雷狄列举尼赫鲁政府在所谓“独立”九个月以后所干的反人民勾当称：仅在雷狄的故乡安德萨省内，警察已袭击过一千个村镇；焚毁房屋三百间；奸污妇女十五名；搜查住宅一万家；殴打二万五千人；逮捕与拘禁五千人；扣押民主人士二百五十名于集中营内。凡有工会活动及民主活动嫌疑的各个村庄，四周都密布了军队哨岗。集中营内惨无人道。绝食已成为集中营内每日发生的事件。
