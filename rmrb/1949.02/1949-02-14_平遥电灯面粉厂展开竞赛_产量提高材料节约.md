　　Pingyao Electric Light Flour Mill Launches Competition
　　Production Increased and Materials Saved
　　[Our Newspaper] After the liberation of Pingyao, the workers of the city's Electric Light Flour Mill, despite the dilapidated condition of the machinery, were in high spirits and launched a competition to actively increase production. The production campaign was launched in November of last year. First, the leadership mobilized the workers and carried out mass discussions and preparations. In terms of engineering, labor was appropriately allocated and organized. The workers of both the electricity and flour sections took the initiative to establish close contact and cooperate with each other, promoting each other. On November 23rd, each team and individual voluntarily set out plans. The total production time was 24 hours a day, with flour milling teams A and B accounting for 18 hours and supplying electricity for lighting for 5 hours. To prevent machine failures, an average of one hour per day was allocated for "inspection and repair." To ensure the completion of production tasks, an inspection committee and a communication group were established among the employees, and factory discipline and regulations were improved. Merits and demerits were clearly distinguished, and rewards and punishments were strictly enforced. A competition was launched between teams A and B, with daytime flour milling supporting the front lines and nighttime electricity supply for lighting the city. In November, 5,622 bags of flour were produced, and in December, 7,497 bags of flour were produced, an increase of 32.5%. In terms of saving electrical materials, 77 jin of hemp oil and 97 jin of machine oil were used in November, totaling 174 jin of oil. In December, only 130 jin of hemp oil and 10 jin of machine oil were used, totaling 140 jin of oil, a reduction of 19.5%. With the arrival of the New Year, to celebrate the victories of liberation in various places and the first New Year after the liberation of Pingyao, all employees enthusiastically launched unprecedented recreational activities. The workers said, "We have never been so happy during the New Year before."
