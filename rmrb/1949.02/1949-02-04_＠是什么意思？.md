Inquiries and Answers

To the Editor:
    In the advertisement for apprentice recruitment by the Taihang Industrial Company published in the newspaper on the 18th of this month, item eight regarding treatment states: "1. Thirty to forty ＠." I don't understand what this means. What is the pronunciation of this character? What does it mean? Please answer!

    To the Editor:
    Recently, I read an article on the lower part of page three of People's Daily No. 213, titled "Handan Electric Company Forms Appraisal Committee to Reasonably Resolve Wage Issues," which mentions that the technician Du Bin only receives 68 ＠, while the third-grade craftsmen Feng Jinsheng, Liu Zhensheng, and others who have only completed two years of apprenticeship receive as much as 61 to 62 ＠. The difference is very small.

    After reading, I do not know how many catties one ＠ equals. I hope you can provide a detailed answer.
  (Pingshan Shang Shiqing)
    Answer: ＠ (pronounced "xi"), is a unit of calculation for the salaries of staff and workers in our North China region. One ＠ is equal to the sum of: two catties of millet, one catty of wheat, one square foot of native cloth, one and a half catties of coal, five qian of oil, and five qian of salt. These items are converted into money or rice according to the market price at the time and place, and distributed monthly. This ensures that workers' wages are not affected by price fluctuations, thus guaranteeing their actual wages.

专栏：询问与答复

　　＠是什么意思？编辑同志：
    在本月十八日的报纸上，登载太行实业公司招收练习生广告上的第八项内待遇：一、三十个至四十个＠。我不明白这是什么意思？这个字念什么音呢？当什么讲呢？请答复！
    　　　　　　（王斌恒）
    编辑同志：近来我读了人民日报二一三号报三版下端题为：“邯郸电灯公司组评议会，合理解决工资问题”一文，内有技术工人杜斌只六十八＠，而学满仅二年的三等工匠冯金声、刘振树等确达六十一至六十二＠。相差额很小。
    读后不知一＠顶几市斤，希详细作答。
  （平山　尚世庆）
    答：＠（音西），是我华北区计算职员，工人薪金的一个计算单位，一个＠等于：小米两市斤、麦子一市斤、土布一方尺，煤一斤半、油五钱、盐五钱的总和。把这些东西，根据当时、当地之市价折成钱或米，按月支发，这样可使工人工资不因物价之波动而受影响。保障了工人的实际工资。
