Qinghe Villages Start Spring Ploughing Preparations
　　Adding Livestock and Intensifying Manure Accumulation
　　[Report from this newspaper] Masses in villages of Qinghe County, Jinnan, are beginning to prepare for spring ploughing, actively buying livestock and launching a surge in manure accumulation. After completing winter ploughing ahead of schedule, mutual aid groups in the Second District's Han Shuangmiao all said, "While livestock is cheap, buying a few more head and accumulating more manure will mean a good harvest next year." The Liu Zhonglin group, with three families sharing one head of livestock, bought another at the market on the eighth day of the new year. The Han Fanghua group also added a cow. Han Baorui bought a donkey, saying, "It's still worth raising livestock; in a year and a half, you can accumulate enough manure for several mu of land." In the Fifth District's Yuzhuang, few used to raise livestock. The land was poorly plowed and harrowed, planting was not timely, manure couldn't be accumulated, and harvests were poor. They all said, "If this continues, things will only get worse. It's still worthwhile to raise more livestock." Based on these circumstances, village cadres immediately made another appeal at a mass meeting. Subsequently, Kang Shanshan strung together three families to buy a cow. This influenced the entire village, leading to the addition of eleven large cows in succession. Households that bought cows all said happily, "This is the capital for increased production." In the First District's Dongzhaozhuang, Xie Denggao dug a large composting pit and went out to collect and accumulate manure every day before dawn. He also personally mobilized Cui Yongxi, Sun Shaotai, Cui Shengtang, Cui Zhongxin, and many others to dig composting pits. Now they have accumulated a lot of manure. His manure pit is already full. He calculated that the manure he accumulated just in the spring would be enough for the fields. He sold three bags of soybeans prepared for the land and bought a large cow with Cui Yonglu. In the Second District's Caijia Village, ninety-five out of the village's one hundred and nine households dug manure accumulation pits. In twenty days, they accumulated more than one hundred large carts of manure. People like Dong Xiangyun and Pan Xueran have all exceeded their plan to accumulate one more cart of manure. They all said, "With manure, you have grain. Without manure, you can't harvest more grain." People in the Third District's Daxinzhuang have been discussing since the autumn harvest, "Farming without manure won't work. Whoever applies less manure will have poorer crops... This winter, we must accumulate more manure." Village cadres also took the lead in timely supervision and leadership, and all quickly hauled a lot of soil to pad the pens and accumulate manure. More than ten families, including Liu Fuchen, Liu Zhenhe, and Bi Yunzhen, have already filled their pens and pushed the manure to the streets, ready to send it to the fields. Sixty-year-old Liu Funian said, "I'll empty this pen now, and by the time I'm planting sorghum, I'll have filled it up again." People in the Fourth District's Liutangkou are all paying attention to manure accumulation. All one hundred and seventy-six households in the village that grow vegetables are composting rotten vegetable leaves mixed with soil. It is estimated that they can compost more than five hundred and sixty large carts of manure. They all say, "This manure can fertilize more than one qing of land." In the Fifth District's Zhaojiazhuang, a mass forum on accumulating more manure was held on the fifteenth of last month. After the meeting, many households added composting pits and stepped up manure accumulation. Sixty-year-old Liu Yufeng often sweeps the streets and accumulates more manure. His wife often tries to fill the bottom of the pot with soil to burn more ash. In one month, the old couple accumulated four large carts of manure. At the mass meeting on October 26, village cadres in Hou Village proposed the slogan of accumulating more manure. Of the village's one hundred and six households, there are now one hundred and one old and new manure pits (twenty-one newly dug). Many households, such as Hou Shijie, Fulin, Wenxin, and Changlin, are about to fill their pits.
