Congratulatory Telegrams from Workers in Chahar Province, Shijiazhuang and Other Places to Workers in Tianjin, Tangshan, and the Surrounding Areas

Dear worker brothers:

	During the period of Kuomintang rule, under the cruel exploitation, terror, hunger, and threats, you persisted in a heroic and tenacious struggle. You finally met our Party—the Chinese Communist Party, and our army—the People's Liberation Army, victoriously and with the factories and machinery intact, and were liberated! The news has made us workers of the re-liberated Zhangjiakou and the Ping-Sui Railway especially excited. We would like to extend our sincere condolences and congratulations to you. We are willing to unite closely around Chairman Mao, strengthen our studies, work hard to produce and build, actively support the front lines, and resolutely carry the revolution through to the end, fully realize the eight peace conditions put forward by Chairman Mao, thoroughly eliminate the reactionary forces of American imperialism and its running dog, the Kuomintang reactionary government, in China, and liberate the entire working class and all working people throughout the country!

All Comrades of the Telecommunications Bureau Workers' Union in Tianjin, Tangshan and surrounding areas:

	In the past, you suffered all kinds of hardships due to the persecution, hunger, humiliation, and arrests inflicted upon you by the Kuomintang reactionaries. Recently, after the heroic attack of the People's Liberation Army and your staunch and unyielding struggle, you have won a glorious liberation. We hereby send a telegram of congratulations and extend our sincere condolences.

	Now that the nationwide revolutionary victory is about to arrive, we should unite as one, encourage each other, strengthen our studies, improve our skills, and work together to completely eliminate the Kuomintang reactionaries and build a new democratic China!
