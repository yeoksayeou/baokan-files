　　Ding County Smashes Kuomintang Secret Agent Organization
  　Mastermind Zhao Dexiang and Others Arrested
    [Jizhong News] The Ding County Public Security Bureau cracked an enemy "North China剿总" (剿总 means "Suppression Headquarters" - a military organization) secret agent case in early December of last year, and the mastermind Zhao Dexiang has been brought to justice. This criminal had already defected to the Kuomintang in 1935, framed cadres in Caocun, and sabotaged our grassroots organizations. When our army liberated Ding County, this criminal fled to Beiping in fear of punishment. He was then introduced by Zhang Wenduo, secretary of the Ding County Kuomintang District Party Department, to join the "North China剿总" secret agent organization, serving as a major intelligence officer with a monthly salary of 18 million yuan. In February of last year, he was ordered by Diao Hairen to sneak back into our area to develop an organization, gather intelligence, and organize small armed groups to carry out sabotage such as robbery and assassination.
    This criminal carried out activities under the guise of doing business, and sometimes appeared as a local government worker, operating in Ding County, Xinle, and Wuji areas. He recruited Zhang Zhengxiang of Dongzhang Village, Zhang Wenzong of Niudian, Wang Deming of Dusi Village, and Geng Wenxiu of Dongli Village as his lower-level secret agents, assigning them the tasks of providing intelligence and sabotaging our work. He also attempted to purchase firearms to organize an armed force and had already made arrangements to rob state-owned stores. In August, he attempted to assassinate our district cadres midway between Mingyuedian and Wuyao Village in Ding County, but failed. Zhao also personally went to Shijiazhuang and Zhengding urban areas to gather information on our army's movements, agency locations, and factory setups, as targets for enemy aircraft bombing; he went to Beiping three times to report the situation. Because of his loyalty to the enemy, he was awarded a bonus of 30 million yuan.
    After the Ding County Public Security Bureau learned of the above situation, it arrested the mastermind Zhao Dexiang and others on December 10th. Except for the secret agent Wang Deming, who fled, all were captured, and two box cannons were seized, along with two secret agent certificates of the "Suppressing Rebellion and Saving the People Vanguard Team" (serial number) 813 unit, numbers 31 and 34. Faced with conclusive evidence, the mastermind Zhao Dexiang and others had no way to deny it, and confessed to their organizational activities and sabotage facts. The criminal, along with the certificates, has now been submitted to the People's Court for punishment according to law. (Li Qiang, Qing Fang)

　　定县破获国民党特务组织
  　主犯赵德祥等落网
    【冀中讯】定县公安局于去年十二月上旬破获敌“华北剿总”特务案，主犯赵德祥已落法网。该犯曾在三十五年即投靠国民党，陷害曹村干部，破坏我之下层组织。我军解放定县时，该犯畏罪潜逃北平，复经定县国民党区党部书记长张文多介绍参加“华北剿总”特务组织，任少校谋报员，月薪一千八百万元。去年二月奉刁化仁之命重新潜入我区，发展组织搜集情报，组织小股武装实行路劫、暗害等破坏。
    该犯以营商为名进行活动，有时以地方工作人员面目出现，活动于定县、新乐、无极一带，发展东张村张争祥，纽店张文总，杜寺村王德明，东里村耿文秀为其特务下层，分担情报、破坏我工作，并图设法购买枪支组织武装，并已布置抢劫公营商店。八月间，曾在定县明月店至吴咬村中途图杀害我区干部未逞。赵并亲到石家庄、正定市区刺探我军调动、机关住地、工厂设置，作为敌机轰炸目标；三次赴平报告情况。因其忠心事敌，获奖金三千万元。
    定县公安局侦知上述情况，乃于十二月十日将主犯赵德祥等分别逮捕。除特务王德明潜逃外，均捕获在案，并搜出二把盒子一支，获得“戡乱救民先锋队”（番号）八一三部队之三十一号三十四号两个特务证件。主犯赵德祥等鉴于证据确凿，无法抵赖，遂将其组织活动破坏事实供认不讳，现已将该犯连同证件呈送人民法庭，依法惩办。（礼强、庆芳）
