　　Suggestions for Yangquan Coal Mines:
  　Limit Coal Carrying Quantity to Protect Children's Health
    To the Editor:
    I worked in Yangquan for over ten days and noticed a problem. I am writing to request that the relevant departments find a solution.
    Yangquan is a coal-producing area, and there is a lot of coal produced by the small mines nearby. Because the mountain roads are impassable for vehicles, all the coal transported from the mines to the receiving stations is carried by human labor or pack animals. Everyone in the family who has the labor power, regardless of gender or age, participates in this coal-carrying production. This is very good. However, some underage boys or girls also participate in coal carrying. I saw the following fact: I was returning to Yangquan from Yijing (three li southeast of Yangquan Station), and at the bottom of a large hillside, there were two children resting. They were wearing cotton-padded trousers and jackets, and their whole bodies were black with coal dust. The most serious thing was that their backs seemed to be hunched, and their legs also seemed to be "bowed." Another child was also like this. After I helped this child carry the coal up the slope, I asked him how old he was this year. He said he was twelve years old, and his name was Liu Chou Xiao. The other was nine years old. The twelve-year-old was carrying about eighty jin, and the nine-year-old was carrying more than forty jin. When they were walking, they were weighed down by these heavy loads and looked terrible.
    It is understood that these two children are regularly employed in coal carrying. The current method of the mines is to give adults a certain amount of money and let them carry as much as possible. Children pay 300 yuan and can carry as much as they can, without a fixed weight. The coal receiving station pays according to the weight of the coal received, more money for more coal, and less money for less coal. This causes the general children to disregard their own health and use the greatest effort to reluctantly carry more, resulting in hunchbacks and leg deformities, not to mention the compression of lung capacity, etc. Their parents do not stop them either. I feel that the government should take care of the health of the next generation and educate these children and their parents. It is best for the mines to send one or two more people to monitor and prevent underage children from carrying excessively heavy loads, in order to protect the health of the children.

### 建议阳泉一带煤矿　限制挑煤数量  保障儿童健康

　　建议阳泉一带煤矿
  　限制挑煤数量
    保障儿童健康编辑同志：
    我到阳泉去工作了十几天，看见有这样一个问题，现在写出来请有关方面想个办法解决一下。
    阳泉是个产煤区，附近各小矿产的煤很多，因为山路不能行车，所有由矿运到站上各收煤处，均是人力挑，或牲畜驮。每家有劳动力的人，不论男女老少均参加这个挑煤生产。这是很好的。但是有的未成年的男孩或女孩，也来参加挑煤、我见到这样一个事实：我由义井（阳泉站东南三里）回阳泉，在一个很大的山坡下面，有两个小孩，在那里歇肩，穿的是棉裤夹袄，混身乌黑，最严重的是他的背好象有些驼了，两条腿，也似乎有些“罗圈”的样子。另一个孩子也是这样。我替这个孩子挑了煤上这个坡后，我问他今年几岁了，他说十二岁，叫刘臭小，另一个九岁，十二岁的挑了有八十斤，九岁的挑了有四十多斤，他们挑着走路时，被这过重的东西压得不象样子。
    据了解这两个小孩是经常以挑煤为职业的。矿上现在的办法是大人给若干元随便尽量挑，小孩是交三百元，能挑多少挑多少，并无一定的重量。而收煤处是按斤收煤，煤多多给钱，煤少少给钱。故使得一般儿童不顾自己的健康，用最大的努力勉强多挑，以致背驼、腿跛，更顾不到肺的呼吸量要被压缩等等。他父母也不加拦阻。我感到政府应该照顾后一代人的健康，要向这些儿童及其家长进行教育。最好是由矿方多派一两人监视不准未成年的儿童挑过重的份量，以保护儿童的健康。
