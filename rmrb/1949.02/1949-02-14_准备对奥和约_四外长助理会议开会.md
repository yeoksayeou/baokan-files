　　Preparing for the Austrian Treaty
  　Four Foreign Ministers' Assistants to Meet
    【Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 13th】London Dispatch: At the request of the Austrian government, the meeting of the assistants to the foreign ministers of the Soviet Union, the United States, Britain, and France, in preparation for the Austrian treaty, reconvened in London on the 9th. The four foreign ministers' assistants had already held multiple meetings on the issue of preparing the Austrian treaty. Thanks to repeated concessions from the Soviet delegation, the meetings had reached some agreements. However, due to the U.S.-led delegations’ insistence on opposing the Austrian border issue (i.e., Yugoslavia’s territorial demands) and Austria's reparations to the Soviet Union, the meetings were interrupted last May.
    The meeting held on the 9th reached an agreement on the meeting procedure, and then proceeded to discuss the unresolved clauses in the treaty. When discussing the border issue, the U.S. and British representatives reiterated their original positions, and the French representative supported the U.S. and British positions, but stated that Yugoslavia could be given economic satisfaction. The Soviet representative stated that he still supported Yugoslavia's territorial demands and was prepared to study other suggestions that would take care of Yugoslavia's interests. In the subsequent discussion, Soviet representative Zarubin (Soviet Ambassador to Britain) proposed that the Foreign Ministers' Assistants' meeting hear the opinions of the Yugoslav delegation on this issue again, but this was opposed by the U.S. and British representatives.

　　准备对奥和约
  　四外长助理会议开会
    【新华社陕北十三日电】伦敦讯：应奥国政府之请，准备对奥和约的苏美英法外长助理会议，已于九日在伦敦复会。准备对奥和约问题，四国外长助理本已举行过多次会议。因为苏联代表团的一再让步，会议亦曾达到若干协议。但是，由于以美国为首的其他代表团，对奥国边界问题（即南斯拉夫的领土要求）及奥国对苏赔款问题，坚持反对立场，遂使会议在去年五月即告中断。
    九日举行的会议，在会议程序上取得协议后，即进而讨论和约中未获协议各款。在讨论边界问题时，美英代表重申原先的立场，法国代表支持美英立场，但称可予南斯拉夫以经济上的满足。苏联代表声明，他仍支持南斯拉夫的领土要求，也准备研究其他照顾南斯拉夫利益的建议。在后来的讨论中，苏代表查鲁宾（苏联驻英大使）提议外长助理会议再听取南斯拉夫代表团对于此一问题的意见，但为美英代表所反对。
