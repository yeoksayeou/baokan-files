Inquiries and Answers

　　To the Editorial Department:
    I am wondering why the treatment in factories is generally very high. What is the reason for this? Why are the various cadres treated differently?

Xiao Lin:
    Regarding the reasons why enterprise departments implement a salary system, while Party, government, and civilian organizations implement a supply system, the answers are as follows:
    Due to the large expenditures during the War of Resistance Against Japan and the People's Liberation War, finances are relatively difficult. Although the current situation is developing very well, on the one hand, we must provide large-scale support for the war, and on the other hand, we must carry out national construction. Difficulties still exist. In order to meet the needs of the war, Party, government, and civilian organizations all implement a system of providing supplies in kind, and strive for economical living standards, concentrating financial and material resources to support the revolutionary war. This is how we have achieved such a great victory today.
    Enterprise departments are operational organs for production and profit. In order to improve work efficiency, enterprise cost accounting is implemented. At the same time, in order to attract a broad range of technical personnel to participate in our production and construction, and to take care of the lives of workers, it is necessary to implement a salary system. This salary system is based on factors such as technical skill and labor intensity, and specifies different levels. Although the current salary levels are not high due to all financial and economic conditions, on average, they are higher than the supply system.
    With future developments, generally speaking, a salary system should be considered and will be implemented. The government is also studying this matter. As for when it will be implemented, it depends on how the situation develops, and it may not be too long. However, it must be recognized that Party, government, and civilian organizations differ in their nature of work from enterprise departments, and it is not possible to demand that they all implement it immediately.

### 企业部门为什么是薪金制？

专栏：询问与答复

　　企业部门为什么是薪金制？编辑同志：
    一般的在工厂里待遇很高，道理为何？各种干部为何不同？　　　效霖效霖同志：
    关于企业部门实行薪金制，党政民各机关干部实行供给制的原因答复如下：
    由于抗日战争与人民解放战争中开支大，财政较困难，虽然目前形势发展很好，但是一面要大规模的支援战争，一面要进行国家性的建设，困难仍然存在，为了适应战争需要，所以党、政、民各机关均实行实物供给制度，生活待遇力求节约，集中财力物力支持革命战争，因而取得了今天这样伟大的胜利。
    企业部门是生产营利的经营机关，为了提高工作效率实行企业成本计算，同时为了吸收广大的技术人材参加我们的生产建设及照顾工人生活，因此实行薪金待遇，这是必要的。这种薪金制是根据其技术与劳动强度等条件规定等级，虽然目前所定薪金因一切财政经济条件还不高，但平均计算起来，比供给制是高的。
    今后形势发展，一般说薪金制是应该考虑也将要实行的了，政府也正在研究，至于何时实行要看情况发展如何，可能不会太久。但必须认识党政民机关与企业部门在工作性质上有所不同，不得要求一下都施行。
