　　Brotherly Troops on the Banks of the Huai River Congratulate Each Other on Victory
  　Our Forces in Central Plains and Western Anhui Meet and Shake Hands
    [Xinhua News Agency, Central Plains, 15th] A certain unit of the People's Liberation Army of the Western Anhui Military Region, which persisted in the struggle in the Dabie Mountains, met and shook hands with a certain unit of the Central Plains Field Army advancing southward on the banks of the Huai River on the 23rd of last month after recovering Huoshan and Lu'an. These two People's Liberation Army units originally belonged to the same organization. In the autumn of 1947, they advanced into the Dabie Mountains and opened up the Western Anhui Liberated Area. In the spring of 1948, the main force of this unit moved to the north of the Huai River in order to annihilate the enemy more effectively. The troops remaining in western Anhui gloriously completed the arduous task of persisting in the Western Anhui Liberated Area for the past year. The field army, which had moved to the north bank of the Huai River, along with other brotherly units, gloriously completed the task of annihilating the main force of the Chiang bandit troops. After these two People's Liberation Army units met, they were particularly cordial. Many soldiers and cadres tightly shook each other's hands and exchanged cordial greetings: "Comrades, you have worked hard in the Dabie Mountains!" "Comrades, you have worked hard in fighting Huang Wei!" Comrades returning from north of the Huai River took out their new shoes, new socks, and new towels from their bundles and gave them to their comrades in the Dabie Mountains. The comrades in the Dabie Mountains took out the nationally famous Lu'an tea and gave it to their brothers. Many newly liberated soldiers said with emotion: "No matter which part of the People's Liberation Army, they are even closer than real brothers."

　　淮河之滨兄弟部队互祝胜利
  　中原皖西我军握手相会
    【新华社中原十五日电】坚持大别山斗争的皖西军区解放军某部，于收复霍山、六安后，已于上月二十三日在淮河之滨与向南挺进之中原野战军某部握手相会。这两支解放军原属同一建制，一九四七年秋挺进大别山，开辟了皖西解放区。一九四八年春，该部主力为更有利地歼灭敌人，即转到淮河以北。留在皖西的部队，一年来光荣完成了坚持皖西解放区的艰苦任务。而转到淮河北岸的野战军，和其他兄弟部队一道光荣地完成了歼灭蒋匪军主力的任务。这两支解放军相见之后，倍加亲切。许多战士干部均紧紧的握着对方的手，相互发出亲切的慰问：“同志，你们在大别山辛苦了！”“同志，你们打黄维辛苦了！”从淮北回来的同志纷纷从自已的包袱里拿出自己的新鞋子、新袜子、新毛巾赠送给大别山的同志。而大别山的同志则把全国闻名的六安茶叶拿出来送给自己的兄弟。许多新解放战士都感动地说：“解放军不管那一部分真是比亲兄弟还亲。”
