Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, February 18th: TASS, Moscow, February 14th: *Pravda* published an article by Gavrilov entitled "Some Results of the Marshall Plan in Italy," which stated:

    The Marshall Plan has only been implemented for a relatively short time, but the illusion that this plan can cure the economies of European countries has already vanished. The people of Western Europe have learned from their own experience the "curative" effects of this plan. The experience of the Italian people is representative in this regard.

    As a result of the implementation of the Marshall Plan in Italy, the Italian economy is now in a severe economic crisis. The level of industrial production is only 65% to 70% of that in 1938. And in the major industrial sectors (except for electricity and coal mining), most enterprises are now operating at only 45% to 50% of their production capacity. As a result of inflation and rising prices, consumption is extremely limited and the standard of living is low. Workers' current wages are hardly enough to sustain a semi-starved existence. The Gasperi government, in accordance with the Marshall Plan, drafted Italy's "Four-Year Plan." This "plan" stipulates that even by 1952, the living standards of the working masses will still be lower than those in 1938. In the year that the Marshall Plan was implemented, from December 1947 to December 1948, the number of unemployed people in Italy increased by 700,000, and now the total number of unemployed has reached three million. Particularly distressed are the workers in the shipbuilding industry, as there is currently no shipbuilding for Italy itself, and there are very few orders from other countries. At the same time, the government purchased 105 Liberty ships from the United States. The Italian Industrial Bureau, which unifies nationalized enterprises, is now in danger of closing down. The 230,000 workers in the Bureau's enterprises are facing the threat of layoffs. The continued growth of the army of unemployed has alarmed the Italian ruling clique, who consider this army of unemployed to be a dangerous force. The Italian government, like solving other problems, is trying to solve the unemployment problem with "methods" that violate the interests of the people, and is preparing to send the unemployed to other countries (Latin America, the United States, Switzerland), claiming that this immigration method is "saving" Italy.

    The Italian economic crisis cannot be explained by a lack of raw materials, a lack of labor, or insufficient production capacity. Its cause lies in the policy adopted by Italian employers of artificially restricting production, who are only concerned with ensuring stable profits and completely disregard the poverty of the masses of people.

    The crisis of the Italian economy, trapped in the Marshall Plan, is arousing the growing resistance of the broad masses of the Italian people to the anti-national policies of the ruling clique. Italian workers correctly believe that the artificial reduction of trade between Italy and Eastern European countries, as ordered by the United States, is one of the main causes of the current crisis. Italian workers resolutely oppose the Marshall Plan in Italy.

### “马歇尔计划”施行的恶果　意已陷入严重经济危机中  失业者总数已达三百万人

　　“马歇尔计划”施行的恶果
    意已陷入严重经济危机中         
    失业者总数已达三百万人
    【新华社陕北十八日电】塔斯社莫斯科十四日讯：真理报发表加夫里洛夫的论文，题为“意大利马歇尔计划化的一些结果”，内称：
    马歇尔计划开始实行以来，时间还相当短，但是，关于这一计划可以医治欧洲国家经济的幻想，已经烟消云散了。西欧人民已经自他们的亲身经验中领教到了这一计划的“治病”效能。意大利人民的经验，在这一方面是具有代表性的。
    由于马歇尔计划施用于意大利的结果，意大利经济现在已陷入严重的经济危机中。工业生产水平仅为一九三八年的百分之六十五到七十。而主要工业部门中（除电力与煤矿以外），大多数企业现在仅开动了生产能力的百分之四十五到五十。由于通货膨胀和物价上涨的结果，消费受到极大的限制，生活水平低下。工人目前的工资几乎不足以维持半饥饿的生活。加斯贝利政府依照马歇尔计划起草了意大利的“四年计划”。这一“计划”规定甚至到一九五二年时，劳动大众的生活水平还低于一九三八年的水平。在马歇尔计划实行的一年中，即自一九四七年十二月至一九四八年十二月，意大利的失业人数已增加了七十万，现在，失业者总数已达三百万人。特别困苦的是造船工业的工人，现在，没有为意大利本国造船，其他国家的定货也极少。同时，政府却自美国购买了自由轮一百零五艘。统一国有化企业的意大利工业局，现在有关门的危险。该局各企业的二十三万工人，正受到解雇的威胁。失业军的继续增长，使意大利统治集团感到震惊，他们认为这支失业军是危险的力量。意大利政府象解决其他问题一样，力图以违反人民利益的“方法”来解决失业问题，正准备将失业者送往他国（拉丁美洲、美国、瑞士），声称这种移民的办法是“拯救”意大利。
    意大利经济危机不能以缺乏原料、缺乏劳动力或生产能力不够来解释。它的原因在于意大利雇主采用的政策是人为地限制生产，他们关心的只是保证稳定利润，而完全无视人民大众的贫困。
    被套入马歇尔计划的意大利经济的危机，正激起意大利人民中广大群众对于统治集团反民族政策的日益增长的反抗。意大利劳动者正确地认为：依照美国命令而人为地减少意大利与东欧国家之间的贸易，是目前危机的主要原因之一。意大利劳动者坚决反对意大利马歇尔计划化。
