How did Zhouliu Village in Xiuwu County Clear Out the Remnants of Bandits?

Zhouliu Village, located in the sixth district of Xiuwu County and consisting of 309 households, was a stronghold of the Chiang Kai-shek bandits before liberation. The reactionary armed forces had a strong presence, with 39 people serving as agents for the enemy and puppet regimes. After liberation, except for one enemy township captain who fled to Xinxiang City, all 38 had returned home and registered with the democratic government. The vast majority were generally engaged in peaceful production. However, a few bad elements continued to engage in illegal activities, and the village government officials were still former Bao and Jia chiefs, leaving the masses deeply threatened by the remaining enemy forces. In addition, 22 households with 55 people had nothing to eat, some begging for food outside. Our district cadres had gone to the village to carry out the work of eliminating the bandit remnants, but because they were surrounded by the old ruling forces upon arrival and cut off from contact with the masses, the situation did not improve after ten or twenty days. Only three defective guns were confiscated.

On the 7th of last month, Comrade Wei Feng, director of the district armed forces committee, arrived in the village and found a dilapidated house on West Street to live in.

In the first few days, he held five kinds of meetings, one after another, targeting different groups, carrying out specific propaganda and education, and arranging work. First, at the mass meeting, he focused on publicizing the victory situation, establishing the masses' confidence in victory, and mobilizing everyone to unite to eliminate the bandit remnants. Then, he convened a meeting of 23 former Bao and Jia chiefs who had undergone preliminary transformation. After repeated publicity on current affairs, explaining the future, and calling for meritorious service to atone for their crimes, he expressed the government's attitude towards those who stubbornly resisted and refused to surrender their guns, and assigned the task of investigating hidden enemy weapons and urging enemy personnel to register, stipulating a report every two days. Immediately afterwards, a meeting was convened with more than 50 former enemy personnel and their families. Combining the discussion of current affairs and policies, pointing out the way out, and assigning work. The next day, a meeting was held with military, cadres, families of martyrs, and basic masses to enlighten everyone to speak out their grievances and raise their class consciousness, and specifically expressed the purpose of coming to the village for work. Everyone unanimously agreed, "The immediate priority is to eliminate the armed bandit remnants," and "To fight the tiger, first pull out its teeth." It was decided to investigate the situation and publicize policies separately, and the mood was very high. That afternoon, another meeting of ten poor peasant households among the former enemy personnel was convened, pointing out: "In the past, you worked for the ruling class and oppressed your own people." Some people immediately cried out about the suffering of being conscripted by Chiang Kai-shek's bandits, and then scrambled to confess to hiding more than 20 short guns and more than ten stones of grain hidden by the enemy. After the above five meetings, the general mobilization work was completed, and the work of eliminating the armed bandit remnants was started from top to bottom.

After the general mobilization, the staff devoted most of their energy to in-depth mobilization and organization of the masses, which was the main reason for the great success in eliminating the bandit remnants. They started by visiting poor peasants. The first one they found was the poor Qin Quantu, and they induced him to accuse Chiang Kai-shek's bandits of their brutal crimes and the suffering of being exploited by the landlord class by chatting about daily life. He then colluded with two shepherds and a shoemaker to convene a small-scale grievance meeting, from which they discovered and resolved the ideological concerns of being afraid of special agents and being shot by black guns. They guided them to clearly recognize that in order to turn over, they must first eliminate the armed bandit remnants. Everyone said: "To turn over, you must fight the tiger (referring to the ruling class), and to fight the tiger, first knock out its teeth (the ruling class's bandit armed forces). Getting out the enemy's guns is like cutting off the enemy's hands." Within a few days, they separately publicized and colluded with twenty working people, dividing them into groups by area. The newly colluded people were informed of each other, and everyone approved at the meeting. The peasant association was quickly organized (Editor's note: In the elimination of bandit remnants, when the masses' thinking has not been fully mobilized, it is not appropriate to organize the peasant association too early. Instead, we should combine the current interests of the masses and more widely organize the masses to eliminate the bandit remnants), and the purity of the organization was maintained. When the organized working masses further demanded armed self-defense and began to carefully establish armed forces, the landlord class conspired to threaten and buy over activists to sabotage. In addition to individually educating the activists, the staff held a mass meeting to expose the conspiratorial activities of the saboteurs, giving the activists and the masses strong support. Ten young people automatically armed themselves, and the peasant association became increasingly larger and consolidated. At the same time, due to continuous education of the masses, paying attention to their frequently changing thoughts, their positive emotions increased day by day. At this time, the staff relied on the militia and peasant association organizations, and closely combined with the organization of production for self-salvation, and further deepened the mass movement to eliminate the armed bandit remnants. This is a very important experience in mobilizing the masses in the new district. Carrying out the elimination of bandit remnants in isolation without combining it with the organization of production will inevitably lead to separation from the masses. The staff appropriately solved the production and living difficulties of the masses by lending grain and loans. Afterwards, the organized masses alternately engaged in production and deeply investigated and monitored the activities of the bandit remnants. Relying on the militia and members, they discovered a large number of hidden enemy and puppet weapons. Then, combined with the reports of the general masses, referring to the information provided by the former Bao and Jia chiefs and the registered enemy personnel, they publicly exposed for the first time that three people were hiding enemy and puppet weapons, prompting them to surrender them. Under this influence, four people immediately surrendered their hidden weapons in public. In just over twenty days, a total of enemy and puppet weapons were confiscated: one small cannon, eleven rifles, eleven short guns, forty-seven short guns, 911 rounds of various bullets, thirty-eight hand grenades, and many military supplies. The masses were in high spirits. A total of 57 people have joined the peasant association; women farmers are also very active. In addition to some people who have automatically joined the peasant association, more than 30 women have organized a spinning group for production and self-salvation.

　　修武周流村如何肃清残匪的？
    拥有三百零九户人家的修武六区周流村，在解放前曾是蒋匪一个据点，反动武装统治很强，在敌伪中干事的共有三十九人。解放后，除一个敌乡队长跑至新乡城以外，三十八人均已返家，并向民主政府登记，其中绝大部分一般还安分生产。有少数坏分子仍非法活动，村政权人员都还是旧保、甲长、群众深受敌残余势力的威胁。另外，当下没吃的二十二户、五十五人，有的在外讨饭。我区干部曾到该村进行肃清残匪工作，但是由于一到村即被旧统治势力包围而割断与群众联系，一二十天，工作局面没有打开，仅收缴了三枝缺枪。
    上月七日，区武委会主任魏峰同志到了该村，自己在西街找了一座破房住下。
    他开头几天，先后召开了五种会议，针对不同对象，进行具体的宣传教育，并布置了工作。首先在群众大会上，着重宣传胜利形势，确立群众胜利信心，动员大家一致起来肃清残匪。接着召开了二十三人的经初步改造后的旧保、甲长会议，于反复宣传时事，说明前途，号召立功赎罪后，表明了政府对顽抗不缴枪者的态度，布置了调查隐藏之敌军武器和督促敌军人员登记之工作任务，并确定两天一汇报。继即召集过去的敌军人员及其家属共五十多人开会，结合讲说时事、政策，指明出路，布置了工作。第二天，召集我军、干、烈属及基本群众开会，启发大家诉苦提高阶级觉悟，并特别明确表示此次来村工作的目的，大家一致同意“眼下先肃清残匪武装”，“打虎先拔牙”，决定分头了解情况宣传政策，情绪很高。当天下午，又召开过去的敌军人员中十户贫农会，指出：“过去是替统治阶级干，压迫自己人”。当场即有的哭诉在蒋匪统治下自己被抓了壮丁等痛苦，进而纷纷争相自报出短枪二十余枝，和隐藏敌之十多石粮食。经过上述五种会议，完成了一般的号召动员工作，即自上而下的开始了肃清残匪武装工作。
    经过一般的动员后，工作人员即以大部精力转向深入发动与组织群众，这是肃清残匪获得巨大成绩的主要原因。开始访问贫苦农民，第一个便找见贫苦的秦全土，从谈家常诱导其控诉蒋匪土匪残暴罪行与受地主阶级的剥削痛苦。并由他串通了两个放羊、一个钉鞋的青年，召开了小型诉苦会，从中发现与解决了怕特务、怕打黑枪的思想顾虑，引导其明确认识要想翻身，首先必须肃清残匪武装，大家说：“翻身要打虎（指统治阶级），打虎先敲牙（统治阶级的土匪武装），搞出敌人的枪，就是斩掉敌人的手”。数天内，分头宣传串通到二十个劳动群众，按片分成小组，把每天新串通的人相互传告，大家开会批准，很快组织起农会（编者按：在肃清残匪中，在群众的思想还未充分发动的时候，不宜过早的组织农会，而应结合群众当前利益，更广泛的组织群众进行肃清残匪），并保持了组织的纯洁性。当组织起来的劳动群众进一步要求武装自卫，并开始着手慎重建立武装时，地主阶级便阴谋威胁与收买积极分子，进行破坏。工作人员除个别教育积极分子外，就召开群众大会揭发破坏分子的阴谋活动，给积极分子与群众以有力的撑腰，十个青年便自动武装起来，农会亦日益扩大与巩固。同时，由于不断教育群众，注意其变化频繁的思想，积极情绪更日渐增高起来。这时，工作人员就以民兵与农会组织为依托，并紧密结合组织生产自救，进一步深入开展了群众性的肃清残匪武装运动。这是目前新区发动群众一条十分重要的经验，孤立进行肃清残匪而不结合组织生产，势必脱离群众。工作人员以贷粮贷款适当解决了群众生产与生活困难，之后，有组织的群众便一面轮替生产，一面深入调查与监视残匪活动，依靠民兵、会员，发现了大批隐藏之敌伪武器，然后又结合一般群众的报告，参考旧保、甲长与已登记之敌军人员所供给的情况，首次公开揭发了有三个人隐藏之敌伪武器，促其缴出，在这个影响下，当众即有四个人自己缴出隐藏武器。短短的二十余天内，总共收缴出敌伪武器小炮一门、长枪十一枝、短枪十一枝、短枪四十七枝、各种子弹九百一十一发、手榴弹三十八颗，及许多军用物资。群众情绪很高，总共已有五十七人参加农会；妇女农民亦很活跃，除有些人自动参加农会外，三十多个妇女并组织了纺花小组生产自救。（林湘、四分区人民武装部）
