　　Taiyue Holds Youth Representative Meeting
  　Drafts Plan for Establishing Youth League
    [Taiyue Electric] The Taiyue District Youth Representative Meeting was held on February 4th. More than 100 youth representatives from various special districts, counties, cities, factories, schools, and government agencies attended the meeting. At the beginning of the meeting, Gu Dachuan, Secretary of the District Committee, delivered the opening speech. He pointed out that this meeting was to study the decision of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China on the establishment of the New Democratic Youth League, and to formulate the guidelines and plans for the establishment of the New Democratic Youth League in our region based on the actual situation. Today, we are approaching nationwide victory, and we need to unite, organize, educate, and cultivate the vast number of young people under the leadership of the Party, improve their political awareness, cultural level, and working ability, and serve the construction of a new democratic China. Subsequently, Comrade Jiang Yi, who attended the North China Youth Representative Meeting, conveyed the Central Committee's resolution on the establishment of the New Democratic Youth League, and drafted a construction plan for the New Democratic Youth League in our region based on the spirit of this resolution. The draft pointed out that in the current situation of the district, the Party rectification and the end of the land reform have not been completed, and the existing cadres lack experience in building the League, we should adopt a step-by-step, focused, and gradually promoted approach to building the League. From now until before "May Fourth," Yangcheng, Jincheng County, City, Jicheng, and Qinyuan should be the focus, and the organizations of the League should be established in these counties and cities, and the League should be established in all public secondary schools. From "May Fourth" to autumn of this year, the League should be established in all counties in the district in a general and focused way. In the above-mentioned key counties and cities, in the villages where the work of Party rectification and land reform has been completed, large villages and towns and streets with a good foundation of the Party and a considerable number of young people with higher awareness should be selected to establish League branches. And in accordance with the League Constitution, produce more than three district League committees and formally establish county and city League committees. Those who have already established the League in secondary schools should be rectified and develop members; those who have not established the League should establish the League. Those who can take care of the leadership can choose one complete elementary school in the key counties and cities to establish the League. Departments such as industrial companies should select a factory with a large number of young people and a good foundation for Party and trade union work to establish a League demonstration. First, the agency League organization should be established by the administrative office.
    Specific steps and methods: The steps for building the League in key counties and cities are: (1) Convey the Central Committee's resolution, train young Party members, and establish a preparatory committee. (2) When the League-building cadres go to the League-building villages and towns, the League-building team should first combine with the young Party members of the village to understand the situation, and then formulate the League-building plan for the village. And actively participate in various production activities and other work in the village, so as to contact the vast number of young people and cultivate and discover young activists. (3) After the above work has been carried out to a certain extent, the League members will be formally developed. (4) Formally establish the League branch and democratically elect the League branch committee members. (5) After there are more than three League branches in the League-building area, the district League committee can be established, and the district League committee will be formally elected. (6) After there are district League committees in more than three districts, a representative meeting of the League in the county and city will be held to formally elect the county and city League committees. (7) After the district League committee is formally established, and the League branches in the villages can begin to play a core leading role among the young people, the League-building team in the district will be canceled. The county and city preparatory committees will also be canceled after the formal League committees are established. Finally, the conference elected Guo Qin'an, Jiang Yi and other eleven people as members of the preparatory committee of the New Democratic Youth League in this region, and elected Guo Qin'an as the secretary and Jiang Yi as the deputy secretary.

　　太岳召开青年代表会议
  　制订建立青年团计划草案
    【太岳电】太岳区青年代表会议，于二月四日召开。到会各专区、县、市、工厂、学校、机关青年代表一百余人。开会后，首由区委书记顾大川致开幕词，他指出这次会议是要研究中共中央关于建立新民主主义青年团的决定，并依据实际情况来规定我区建立新民主主义青年团的方针和计划。今天我们已接近全国胜利，需要在党的领导下，团结、组织、教育与培养广大青年，提高他们的政治觉悟、文化水平、工作能力，为建设新民主主义新中国服务。随后由出席华北青年代表会议的蒋毅同志传达中央关于建立新民主主义青年团的决议，并根据这一决议的精神，拟定了本区新民主主义青年团的建设计划草案。该草案指出目前全区整党、结束土地改革尚未完成与现有干部缺乏建团经验的情况下，应采取有步骤、有重点、逐步推广的方式建团。由现在到“五四”前，以阳城、晋城县、市、冀城、沁源为重点，建立各该县、市团的组织，并在各公立中等学校建团。“五四”到今年秋季，全区各县普遍重点的建团。上述重点县、市，在整党、土地改革结束工作已完成的村庄中，选择党的基础较好，有相当数量的青年，而觉悟亦较高的大村镇、街道，建立团的支部。并按照团章产生三个以上区团委会和正式成立县、市团委会。中等学校已建团者加以整顿，并发展团员；未建团一律建团。领导力量亦能照顾者，在重点县、市可选择一完小建团。实业公司等部门则选择青年多，党和工会工作基础好的一个工厂建团示范。先由行署机关，建立机关团的组织。
    具体步骤与方法：关于在重点县、市建团步骤为：（一）传达中央决议、训练青年党员，成立筹委会。（二）建团干部，赴各该建团村镇时，先由建团小组结合该村青年党员，了解情况，然后规定本村建团计划。并积极参加该村各种生产活动及其他工作，从而联系广大青年群众，培养、发现青年积极分子。（三）上述工作进行到一定程度后，即正式发展团员。（四）正式成立团支部，并民选团支部委员。（五）在建团区内，已有三个以上团支部后，即可成立区团委会，正式选举区团委会。（六）在已有三个区以上的区团委会后，召开全县、市团的代表会，正式选举县、市团委会。（七）区团委会正式成立后，及各该村团支部能开始在青年中起核心领导作用时，该区建团小组即取消。县、市筹委会在正式团委会成立后亦取消。最后大会选出郭钦安、蒋毅等十一人为本区新民主主义青年团筹备委员会委员，并推选郭钦安为书记，蒋毅为副书记。
