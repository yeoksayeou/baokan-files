Xinhua News Agency, Shenyang, 9th: The highest Party, government, and military leadership organs in Northeast China recently sent a congratulatory telegram to the Northeast and North China Field Armies on their great victory in liberating Tianjin and Beijing. The original telegram stated:

　　We celebrate the great victory of our army in liberating Tianjin and Beijing, thereby fundamentally liberating all of North China. This victory, along with the victories of fraternal liberation armies across the country, especially the victory of the Huaihai Campaign, has placed the reactionary rule of the Kuomintang in a state of turmoil and collapse, bringing the nationwide victory of the People's Liberation War ever closer. Advance victoriously, wage a courageous and resolute struggle to thoroughly realize the eight peace conditions proposed by Chairman Mao and supported by the people of the whole country, and carry the revolution through to the end. We vow to fully support your sacred struggle. We hereby send our heartfelt congratulations.

　　The Northeast Bureau of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China, the Northeast Administrative Committee, and the Northeast Military Region of the People's Liberation Army.
