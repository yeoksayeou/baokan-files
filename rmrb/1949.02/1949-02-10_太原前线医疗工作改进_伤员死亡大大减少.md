　　Improved Frontline Medical Work in Taiyuan
  　Greatly Reduces Casualties

　　[Report from this newspaper] During the Taiyuan campaign, frontline medical treatment work has shown significant improvement. From the beginning of October last year, when various column hospitals began admitting the wounded, to the preliminary statistics on December 10, the mortality rate of the wounded was 4.16% (including those who died on the way after being wounded at the front or immediately upon arrival at the hospital). Those who died in the hospital accounted for only 1.98% of all the wounded, and 3.06% of the wounded in the hospital. The complete treatment process took only half a month from the end of admission. They adopted new methods for treating war wounds, mainly to enhance the body's natural healing abilities. Technically, they promoted alternating bandages, expansion, and plaster fixation. In the past, medical staff and the wounded were accustomed to "frequent dressing changes," but now they are satisfied with the new treatment because in the past, the wounded felt pain during dressing changes, but now they do not feel pain after being put in a cast. According to statistics from the Jin-Cha-Ji Border Region field hospitals in 1947, the mortality rate of the wounded was 4.9%, and in the Jin-Ji-Lu-Yu area, it was 4%. In this campaign, due to transportation difficulties, the vast majority of the wounded arrived at the hospital an average of 30 hours after being wounded, and most of the wounds were already festering. However, in terms of the reduction in the mortality rate, a new record has been created. According to the Yan army medical monthly, volume 1, issue 4, during World War II, the United States had 597,000 wounded, with a mortality rate of 4%. This country, with efficient medicines and transportation, can also feel no shame. The reason for achieving this result is that, on the one hand, technology has been improved and scientific treatment methods have been mastered. More importantly, all medical workers, from the main responsible cadres to the nurses, have a high degree of political awareness. Many comrades participated in rescuing the wounded and bandaging at the front, overcoming various difficulties such as shortages of medicines, beds, and personnel. Due to the above achievements, the medical work has been commended by the corps leaders. Everyone unanimously stated that not only should the mortality rate be further reduced next time, but also that the return-to-duty rate, disability rate, and other aspects should surpass the United States.

　　太原前线医疗工作改进
  　伤员死亡大大减少
    【本报讯】太原战役中，前线医疗救治工作有显著改进。从去年十月上旬各纵队医院开始收容伤员，至十二月十号初步统计，伤员牺牲者百分之四·一六（内有从火线负伤后在运送途中或刚到医院即牺牲者），在医院牺牲者仅占全伤员百分之一·九八，占医院伤员百分之三·○六。从停止收容算起，完整的治疗过程仅半个多月。他们采用的是新的战伤治疗法，主要是提高自然治愈机能。技术上提倡交换绷带、扩制、石膏固定等。过去，医务员、伤员都习惯“多换药”，现在则对新疗法感到满意，因为过去伤员上药时很痛，现在打了石膏不感到痛苦。一九四七年晋察冀边区各野战医院统计，伤员牺牲率占百分之四·九，晋冀鲁豫为百分之四。而此次战役中，因运送困难，绝大多数伤员平均负伤后三十小时始到达医院，伤处多已化脓，但从牺牲率的减少来说，已创造了新纪录。据阎匪军医月刊一卷四期刊载：美国第二次世界大战中，负伤者五十九万七千人，牺牲者占百分之四，此一有高效药品、运输工具之国家，亦不无愧色。获得这种成绩的原因，一方面是提高了技术、掌握了科学的治疗方法；更重要的是全体医务工作同志，从主要负责干部到护士有高度政治觉悟。很多同志参加了抢救伤员、火线包扎，克服了药品、病床、人少等种种困难。由于以上成绩，医疗工作获得了兵团首长的嘉奖。大家一致提出：下次不仅要使牺牲率更加减少，而且要在归队率、残废率等各方面超过美国。
