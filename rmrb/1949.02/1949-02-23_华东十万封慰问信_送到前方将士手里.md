Xinhua News Agency, East China, February 21st: The more than ten million letters of condolence brought to the front by the East China Comfort Group have been distributed to various troops, hospitals, and civilian workers accompanying the army. These letters fully express the love, admiration, and gratitude of the millions of people in the rear for the soldiers at the front, and reflect the will of the people in the rear to support the front and strive for revolutionary victory. Liu Zhiyuan, an employee of the Jinan Post and Telecommunications Bureau, wrote in his letter: "We workers have been liberated by your fighting, and now we all have food and clothing. I sincerely thank you. In the future, wherever you fight, we will follow, and we will guarantee that you receive letters from home and see newspapers on time." Ding Bu, an employee of the East China Railway Bureau, wrote in his letter: In order to better support the front, we completed the repair of the Jinan-Xuzhou section of the Tianjin-Pukou Railway half a month ahead of schedule in mid-December last year. In the future, we guarantee that wherever the army goes, the railway will be repaired, and the train will be opened. Ma Da, a teacher at the Tanxian Municipal Joint Middle School, reflected the people's sentiment of supporting the front in his letter: "During the New Year, many students did not go home, but took care of the wounded; the workers did not rest, but produced for the front." Zhou Guangchun, Deputy Director of the Shandong Provincial Grain Bureau, also personally wrote a letter to solicit the troops' opinions on grain work, and expressed that he would better guarantee the supply to the front in the future. Many letters contained pens, pencils, toothbrushes, and towels, and some letters contained stationery and stamps, requesting to make friends with the soldiers at the front and communicate with each other. Combat heroes, model workers, and wounded soldiers received even more love from the people in the rear, and they received a particularly large number of letters of condolence. Many letters were written with the hope that the wounded would take good care of themselves and recover their health as soon as possible. In the letters that many military family members wrote to their sons, brothers, and husbands, in addition to telling them about the family situation, they also encouraged them to work with peace of mind in the army.
