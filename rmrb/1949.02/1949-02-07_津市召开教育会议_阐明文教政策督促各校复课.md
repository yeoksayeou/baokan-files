Xinhua News Agency, Tianjin, February 2nd: The Cultural and Educational Department of the Tianjin Military Control Commission of the Chinese People's Liberation Army and the Tianjin Municipal People's Government Education Bureau recently convened separate symposiums and joint conferences for faculty and staff of public and private universities, colleges, middle schools, and primary schools in Tianjin. These meetings were held to elucidate the Chinese Communist Party and the People's Government's policies of protecting cultural and educational undertakings, uniting with and transforming intellectuals, and to urge all schools to promptly resume classes, so as not to delay students' studies.

At the symposium held on January 21st for faculty and staff of national and provincial universities, colleges, and middle schools in Tianjin, attendees included: Huang Zijian, Secretary-General of Nankai University; Bao Juemin, Dean of the School of Political Economics; Chen Jinmin, Dean of the School of Science at Beiyang University; Professors Liu Zhixiang and Zhang Guofan; Lu Yincheng, President of Hebei Provincial Institute of Technology; Shen Juru, Director of Academic Affairs at the College of Law and Commerce; Liu Lun, Director of the Manufacturing Department of the Fisheries College; and representatives from Hebei Provincial Tianjin Boys' Middle School, Girls' Middle School, and other schools, totaling more than twenty people. The meeting was personally presided over by Huang Songling, Minister of the Military Control Commission's Cultural and Educational Department, and Deputy Minister Wang Lanxi.

At the meeting, after the heads of each school reported on the damage suffered by their respective schools during the war by the Kuomintang bandit troops, Minister Huang Songling delivered a speech. He expressed his condolences for the unity and efforts of students, faculty, staff, and school workers in protecting their schools during the Tianjin liberation campaign. He then explained that the CCP and the People's Government attach great importance to cultural and educational work. They have always held a respectful and united attitude towards all professors, teachers, experts, writers, and intellectuals who are willing to serve the people. They are all the wealth of the country and indispensable for building a New Democratic China. It is hoped that professors, teachers, experts, and all intellectuals in Tianjin will use their knowledge to serve the people, support the people's liberation war, thoroughly defeat the reactionary rule of the Kuomintang, and contribute all their strength to cultivating the next generation of New China.

Regarding the current policies adopted by the Cultural and Educational Department for various schools in Tianjin, Minister Huang pointed out that the main principle is to temporarily maintain the status quo and resume classes quickly. However, a small number of special agent schools established by the Kuomintang will be disbanded and will not be allowed to continue to exist. All reactionary courses in the past, such as "Civics" and "Party Principles," are not allowed to be taught. The guidance system in each school should be abolished. As for faculty and staff, they will temporarily retain their original positions and salaries. It is hoped that everyone will work with peace of mind and earnestly plan for the resumption of classes in each school.

On the 24th, the Cultural and Educational Department of the Military Control Commission also invited faculty and staff from private colleges and universities in Tianjin to hold a symposium. Attendees included Liu Nairen, President of JinGu University; Wang Xiade, Director of Academic Affairs; Jiang Fangruo, President of Yude College; Lin Shichang, Secretary-General of Daren College; and Liu Weijian, President of Lixing Industrial College, among others. During the meeting, Minister Huang Songling hoped that all schools would resume classes quickly and that faculty and staff of all schools would stand on the people's position, work with peace of mind, and contribute all their strength to cultivating new youth. He also pointed out that church schools must abide by the laws and decrees of the People's Government and must not give any preferential treatment or discrimination to faculty and staff or students based on whether or not they believe in religion.

The 24 secondary schools and more than 100 primary schools originally under the Tianjin Municipality have been taken over by personnel dispatched by the Tianjin Municipal People's Government. On January 21st, the Tianjin Municipal People's Government Education Bureau specially convened a joint meeting of principals, academic affairs directors, and administrative directors of municipal middle and primary schools, with 120 units and more than 350 people attending. At the meeting, Lin Ziming, the person in charge of the Education Bureau, instructed all schools to complete registration quickly and resume classes as soon as possible. Faculty and staff of all schools, except for the directors of moral education, will temporarily continue to serve as usual. The principals of each school must be responsible to the Education Bureau for restoring order within the school and organizing the resumption of classes.

On the 22nd, the Education Bureau convened another joint meeting of faculty and staff from private middle and primary schools in Tianjin, with more than 350 units and more than 500 people attending. Lin Ziming, the person in charge of the Education Bureau, put forward the following points regarding the current work of private middle and primary schools: all private middle and primary schools should register with the People's Government for record-keeping, and the government hopes that all schools will resume classes quickly. The enrollment problem can be conducted through examinations based on the specific situation of each school. Fees are also determined by the school authorities themselves and submitted to the Education Bureau for approval. Each school should also achieve: (1) not delay students' studies; (2) help students with progressive activities; (3) abolish corporal punishment and all punishments of a corporal nature; (4) unite teachers and students to run the school well.
