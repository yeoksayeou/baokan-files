The villages in the Southern Hebei Fourth District that have completed land reform and party rectification have thoroughly eliminated feudalism, improved relations between cadres and the masses, and between middle and poor peasants. Most of them are showing a new atmosphere of unity in production, actively tilling the land, accumulating fertilizer, adding livestock, and developing sideline production. The masses in Ningnan reflected: "With land, we have roots, and with land deeds, we feel at ease." In Tacun Village, after the land certificates were issued, three new middle-peasant households even rushed to plant barren land. Li Delian, a middle peasant in Weijiazhuang, Guangzong, went to plow the land the day after the land reform was completed. Wang Hengshun, a poor peasant in Xiaowang Village, after being allocated land, went to the fields the next day to level the field edges and plant trees, and set a one-year production plan. After the party rectification in Yujiazhuang, the Fourth District of Pingxiang, party members led the masses to dig an eight-mile-long canal in just over ten days, which will be able to irrigate the fields as soon as spring begins this year. In Nandou Village, Nanhe, fifty people carry manure baskets every day; in Tacun Village, Ningnan, 40 out of 170 households buy coal to burn, saving firewood for composting manure; in Longyao, five villages have now accumulated 18,780 carts of manure. There has also been a significant increase in farm tools and livestock. In Tacun Village, Ningnan, and Beiyang Village, Longyao, one blacksmith shop has been working continuously in the village for dozens of days, unable to keep up with the work. Tacun Village repaired five waterwheels, two carts, and many farm tools. The number of livestock has increased from 27 to 54. Previously, people would buy damaged goods and sell good ones, but now they buy good ones and sell damaged ones. Lizhuang in the Fourth District of Zhentang has increased its livestock from nine head in the spring to 34. One village in Nanxiang, Longyao, has added 15 head of livestock, now has 72 head, and plans to increase it to 100 head this winter through sideline production.

Due to the masses' active production and the leadership's multifaceted support, sideline production such as textiles, oil mills, cotton ginning, and weaving has also developed greatly. In the Fourth District of Pingxiang, except for the widowed and orphaned, the vast majority of the villagers are organized in sideline production such as brine salting and transportation. In Nanxiang, Longyao County, and Beitiangong Village, Nangong County, textile production has universally dug underground workshops. Some families, regardless of gender, work in shifts day and night in underground workshops to spin cotton and weave cloth, forming a hot textile upsurge. In Liujiazhuang, the Third District of Renxian County, the number of households engaged in saltpeter refining has increased from 369 to 387, and 40 households have already purchased tens of millions of Hebei currency.

　　冀南四分区完成整党土改村庄
  　农民团结闹生产
    【本报讯】冀南四分区各县已经结束土改整党的村庄，彻底消灭了封建，干群关系及中贫农关系得到了改善，大多数都呈现出一种团结生产的新气象，积极的整地、积肥、添牲口，开展副业生产。宁南的群众反映：有了地，有了根，有了地契放了心。塔底村在发完土地证后，有三户新中农连荒地也抢种了。广宗魏家庄中农李德连，土改结束后第二天就去犁地。小王村贫农王恒顺分了地以后，第二天就到地里垫地头、种树，并订好一年生产计划。平乡四区于家庄整党后，党员率领群众在十几天里挖了八里地的水渠，今年一开春即能浇水。南和南窦村现在每天有五十个人背粪筐抬粪；宁南塔底村一百七十户，有四十户买煤烧，省下柴沤粪；隆尧—五个村现在积起了一万八千七百八十车粪。农具牲口，也有显著增加。宁南塔底村、隆尧北阳村，一个铁匠炉都能一连在村干几十天，活都做不完。塔底村修理了水车五辆，大车两辆和好多农具。牲口由二十七头增加到五十四头。以前是买坏卖好，现在是买好卖坏。振堂四区里庄已由春天的九头牲口增加到三十四头。隆尧南乡一个村就添了十五头牲口，现已有牲口七十二头，计划今冬经过副业生产，增加到一百头。
    在纺织、油坊、弹轧花、编织等副业生产上，由于群众积极生产，领导上多方扶助，也有很大发展。平乡四区除了孤寡户，全村绝大多数都组织在淋盐、运输等副业生产中。隆尧县南乡，南宫县北天宫等村的纺织，已普遍挖了窨子。有的全家人不分男女黑天白日轮班到窨子纺花织布，形成炽热的纺织潮。任县三区刘家庄三百六十九户，淋硝的已发展到三百八十七户，有四十户已经购买几十万元冀钞。　（苏幼民）
