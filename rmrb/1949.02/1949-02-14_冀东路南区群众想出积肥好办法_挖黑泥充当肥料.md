[Jidong Telegram] The masses in some districts and villages of the Ludong South District and the Fourteenth Sub-district are actively digging black mud from the bottom of pits to use as fertilizer. In the Ludong Directly Subordinate District, 127 people participated in digging black mud, and have already dug 2,150 cartloads. Zhang Yinian and Zhang Wenming, Communist Party members from Kusi Village in Dalan Township, dug mud barefoot in the icy water. They said, "Black mud is more fertile than horse manure. Enduring a little cold now will ensure a greater harvest of grain in the autumn." Female Communist Party member Du Ruzhen (a martyr's family member) led six military dependents to dig black mud, saying, "It is an honor to be a military dependent, and it is even more honorable to work hard in production." The village has 24 military dependent households without labor, requiring 580 mu of land to be cultivated on their behalf. The masses are striving to apply one cartload of black mud to each mu of land belonging to military dependents. They have already dug 250 cartloads. In Sijia Village, 30 people are participating in digging black mud. Veteran soldier Jia Lian’san dug 40 cartloads in eight days. The black mud in the pits near Mashaozhi Village in Leting has been completely dug out. Military dependent Ma Da Niang and her daughter get up early and dig more than 20 cartloads. Ma Tongcai, who used to be idle and lazy, has also participated in labor under the education of the masses, and has already dug more than 70 cartloads of mud. The masses in the low-lying areas of the Fourteenth Sub-district also use black mud as fertilizer. Since the autumn harvest last year, a wave of mud digging has been set off in Huogezhuang, Sanhe. The village has 2,936 mu of land, and has already dug more than 10,000 cartloads of mud, with an average of more than three cartloads of black mud applied per mu. Last year, due to the lack of fertilizer, the village only harvested five dou (15 jin per dou) of corn per mu, but this year it is estimated that production will double compared to last year. (Note: Black mud is dirty mud that accumulates at the bottom of pits with foul water in the summer, and the fertile mud can be equivalent to stable manure or pig manure).

　　冀东路南区群众想出积肥好办法
  　挖黑泥充当肥料
    【冀东电】路南区、十四分区两分区部分区村，群众积极挖坑底黑泥，充当肥料。路南直属区参加挖黑泥群众有一百二十七人，已挖黑泥二千一百五十车。大兰坨乡库司庄党员张义年、张文明光脚在冰水里挖泥，他说：“黑泥比马粪还肥，这时候挨点冻，来年秋天能够多打粮食。”妇女党员杜如珍（烈属）带动六名军属妇女挖黑泥，并说：“咱们军属光荣，努力生产就更光荣。”该村无劳力军属廿四户，需代耕土地五百八十亩，群众争取给军属土地每亩上一车黑泥。已挖出二百五十车。四贾庄有卅人参加挖黑泥。荣军贾连三，八天即挖四十车。乐亭马烧纸村附近坑内黑泥，已全部挖出，军属马大娘和女儿起早搭黑挖二十余车。过去游手好闲的马通财在群众教育下也参加了劳动，已挖泥七十余车。十四分区低洼地区群众，亦以黑泥充当肥料。三河霍各庄自去年秋收后即掀起挖泥热潮，全村土地二千九百三十六亩，已挖泥一万余车，平均每亩地可上黑泥三车多。去年该村由于肥料缺少，每亩地只收获玉米五斗（每斗十五斤），今年估计能比去年增产一倍。（注：黑泥系夏季随臭水积坑底之脏泥，肥者可抵厩肥或猪肥）。
