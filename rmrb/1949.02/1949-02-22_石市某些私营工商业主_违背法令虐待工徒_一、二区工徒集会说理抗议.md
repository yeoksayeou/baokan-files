　　Safeguard the Workers’ Democratic Rights and Living Standards!
    Some Private Industrialists and Businessmen in Shijiazhuang
  　Abuse and Mistreat Workers and Apprentices
    Workers and Apprentices in Districts One and Two Gather to Reason and Protest
    [Shijiazhuang News] Recently in Shijiazhuang, incidents have been constantly occurring where private factory owners and private business owners, failing to understand the greater good, have been unreasonably firing workers and shop assistants, verbally and physically abusing apprentices, and deducting wages. According to investigations in District One, the following seven businesses have been involved in unwarranted dismissals: Fu Yong Pickle Garden, Xin Tai Long Shoe Shop, etc.; the following three have been involved in beating and abusing workers and apprentices: People's Barber Shop, Li Guangzhu Mirror Shop, etc. Similar incidents have occurred in District Two. On February 13th, over six hundred and fifty workers, shop assistants, and apprentices from over sixty trades in District One, and over two hundred members of the shop employees' union in District Two, gathered separately to protest these illegal acts and to reason publicly. At the meeting in District One, Li Fucai, a worker unjustly fired by Manager Wang of Lihua Cotton Weaving Factory, said: "Around the 20th day of the twelfth lunar month, Manager Wang deliberately said he was not going to continue, settled the accounts and drove me away. I wove towels at Lihua for three months. In the last month, I earned one and a half jin of millet for each dozen woven. At the time, the market price was 10,005 border currency per jin of millet. I wove sixty dozen in total, but Manager Wang only gave me 10,000 border currency per dozen." Hao Shengming, a seventeen-year-old apprentice at the People's Barber Shop, took the stage and said angrily: "Since January, my boss has beaten me three times. On the first day of the Lunar New Year, I was bringing food into the room for my boss, and accidentally knocked over a bowl with the curtain. The inner boss then made me kneel, and I knelt for more than twenty minutes before the boss's guest interceded and allowed me to stand up." Xu Zhaofeng, a dismissed staff member from Yonghe Tang Chinese Medicine Shop on South Street, told everyone: "I have been a long-time staff member at Yonghe Tang for eight years. I have always considered the business when making deals for the shop. Who knew that Manager Tong would kick me away after I had served my purpose, giving me 300,000 Jichaopiao and unreasonably dismissing me from the counter." After everyone had complained and reasoned, Director Sun of the District One Labor Union called on everyone to join the union, unite, and, under the leadership of the union, implement the policy of mutual benefit for labor and capital. He also criticized some capitalists for infringing upon workers' welfare, making it impossible for workers to support their families, let alone themselves, with the wages they earned. Some capitalists restrict workers and shop assistants from joining unions and attending meetings, and do not allow workers and apprentices to read progressive books, depriving workers of their democratic rights. These are all actions that violate the laws of the People's Government. District Chief Zheng of District One also pointed out: These problems are the fault of the capitalists. The democratic government will resolutely stand up for the abused workers, shop assistants, and apprentices. Anyone who does not implement government laws will be punished by the people's law. At the meeting in District Two, Du Yuegang, a worker from Fuhua Electric Mill who had been unjustly dismissed, reported the details of his mistreatment. The masses questioned Manager Wang of the factory, and under the pressure of the angry crowd, Wang agreed to allow Du to return to his position. After these incidents, the Shijiazhuang Daily published a short commentary calling for the correct implementation of the policy of mutual benefit for labor and capital, and for safeguarding the workers' democratic rights and living standards, in order to increase workers' enthusiasm for production and increase production.

　　保障工人生活民主权利！
    石市某些私营工商业主
  　违背法令虐待工徒
    一、二区工徒集会说理抗议
    【石家庄讯】石市近来不断发生不明大义的私营工厂厂主、私商老板无理解雇工人、店员，辱打学徒，以及克扣工资等事件。据一区调查发生无理解雇事件的有：福涌酱菜园、新泰隆鞋铺等七家；殴打虐待工徒的有：人民理发馆、李光珠镜子铺等三家。二区亦有同类事件发生。二月十三日一区六十余行业，工人、店员、学徒六百五十余人，及二区店员工会会员二百余，分别集会对此非法行为提出抗议，并进行公开说理。在一区的会上，被利华棉织工厂王掌柜无故开除的工人李福才说：“腊月二十几，王掌柜故意说他不干了，算算帐撵我走。我在利华织了三个月毛巾，末后一个月，每织一打挣小米一斤半，当时市价每斤小米边币一万零五，我一共织了六十打，王掌柜每打只给我算一万元。”人民理发馆十七岁的学徒郝生明走上主席台，气愤地说：“自一月份至今，我掌柜重打了我三次。大年初一，我给掌柜往屋里端饭，门帘撞摔了一个碗，又被内掌柜罚跪，跪到二十多分钟，还是掌柜的客人来讲情，才让我站起来。”南大街永和堂中药铺被开除的伙友许兆峰对大家说：“我是永和堂八年的老伙友，我给柜上干买卖，处处为生意着想，谁知佟掌柜过河拆桥，给了我三十万元冀钞，无故让我离柜。”大家纷纷诉苦说理之后，一区工会孙主任号召大家参加工会，团结起来，在工会领导下，贯彻实现劳资两利方针。并批评某些资本家侵犯工人福利，使得工人所得工资别说养家，连自己也养不住；有些资本家限制工人、店员参加工会、参加会议，不让工徒看进步的书籍，剥夺工人民主权利。这些都是违犯人民政府法令的行为。一区政府郑区长也指出：这些问题错误在资方，民主政府坚决给受虐待的工人、店员、学徒作主，谁要不执行政府法令，谁就要受到人民法律的制裁。二区的会上，被无故开除的复华电磨工人杜月岗报告受虐待的经过后，群众纷纷向该厂王掌柜提出质问，在群情激愤下，王答应允许杜回柜。这些事件发生后，石家庄日报曾发表短评，号召正确执行劳资两利的方针，保障工人生活民主权利，以达到提高工人生产热情增加生产的目的。
