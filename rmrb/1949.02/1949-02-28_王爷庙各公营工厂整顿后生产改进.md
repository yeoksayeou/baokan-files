Xinhua News Agency, Shenyang, 19th: After rectification, the production and management of the public factories in Ulanhot City (i.e., Wangyemiao), the capital of the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region, have improved. The rectification was carried out in several aspects: (1) Streamlining non-production personnel. A total of 271 people were streamlined from various factories, and suitable jobs were introduced to them according to their wishes. (2) Clearing the warehouse and appropriately disposing of stockpiled materials. (3) Each factory reorganized some institutions, adjusted labor, and improved the system according to its own specific situation. After these rectifications, the production of each factory has improved significantly. For example, the Tanning Factory's chemical department used to tan only eight to ten hides during the day, but now it has increased to about twenty. The Clothing Factory used to make three sets of military uniforms per person per day, but now it has increased to five sets.

　　王爷庙各公营工厂
  　整顿后生产改进
    【新华社沈阳十九日电】内蒙古自治区首府乌兰浩特市（即王爷庙）各公营工厂经过整顿后，生产的经营已有改进。整顿系从几方面着手进行：（一）精简非生产人员。先后共精简了各厂二百七十一名，并根据其自愿，给他们介绍了适当职业。（二）清理仓库，适当地处理了积压资材。（三）各厂根据自己的具体情况，合理地改组某些机构和调整了劳动力，并健全了制度。经过这些方面的整顿，各厂的生产已有明显的改进。如制革厂药水科过去白天只熟八至十张皮子，现在提高到二十张左右。被服厂过去每人每天做三套军衣，现在增加到五套。
