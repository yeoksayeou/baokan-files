Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 4th. The Central Committee of the Chinese Communist Party today issued the following statement on the grave issue of the Nanking Kuomintang traitor government releasing Japanese war criminal Yasuji Okamura, who has returned to Japan, and, following US orders, sending 260 convicted Japanese war criminals back to Japan together:

　　On January 31, 1949, the Central Broadcasting Station of the Nanking Kuomintang traitor government announced: "Tokyo dispatch, January 31: According to reliable sources, Yasuji Okamura, recently released by our military tribunal and whose extradition has been requested by the CCP, is already on his way back to Japan." On the same day, the government's Central News Agency Tokyo English dispatch stated: "Two hundred and sixty Japanese war criminals convicted by Chinese courts are scheduled to arrive in Yokohama on a prisoner-of-war repatriation ship on February 4 and will serve their sentences in Sugamo Prison. Deputy Head Shen of the Chinese delegation stated: The transfer of Japanese war criminals to Japan is a measure taken by the Chinese government at the request of the Japanese repatriation authorities and the families of the war criminals." This news was confirmed on the 2nd of this month by Shi Meiyu, the president of the pseudo-Defense Ministry Military Tribunal of the Kuomintang traitor government. According to an AFP Tokyo dispatch of January 31: Colonel Carpenter, head of the legal section of MacArthur Headquarters, admitted that the decision to transfer Japanese war criminals from China to the United States was made by General MacArthur himself. The Central Committee of the Chinese Communist Party believes that the absurd actions taken by the Chinese Kuomintang traitor government and the US MacArthur Headquarters regarding Yasuji Okamura and other 260 Japanese war criminals, aimed at protecting the resurgence of Japanese aggression against China, are completely contrary to the will of the Chinese people and cannot be recognized by the Chinese people. The Chinese people, at the cost of immense sacrifice, fought the Japanese invading army for eight years. Yasuji Okamura and the other 260 war criminals, who bear primary responsibility for the various serious crimes of the Japanese invading army, cannot be allowed to escape through the collusion of the Chinese Kuomintang traitor government, which is in fact unable to exercise its functions, and the MacArthur Headquarters, which has no right to interfere in this matter. The Central Committee of the Chinese Communist Party declares that the Nanking Kuomintang traitor government should immediately recapture Yasuji Okamura and other Japanese war criminals and hand them over to the headquarters of the Chinese People's Liberation Army, which played a major role in the Chinese War of Resistance Against Japan and currently bears actual responsibility for China's national defense. If this request is not fulfilled, the Chinese People's Liberation Army reserves the full right to recapture Yasuji Okamura for retrial and to recapture the other 260 Japanese war criminals who have been transferred to Japan. In addition, the Chinese People's Liberation Army reserves the same right to demand retrial of Yoshizo Nishio, former commander-in-chief of the Japanese Expeditionary Army in China, Tada Shun, former commander of the Japanese North China Expeditionary Army, Ando Kisaburo, former commander of the Japanese Southern China Expeditionary Army, Kodama Yoshio, former director of the Japanese Naval Special Service Agency in Shanghai, Tani Masayuki, former Japanese ambassador to the puppet government in Nanking, Aoki Kazuo, former president of the Japanese Planning Board, Minister of Greater East Asia, and top economic advisor to the puppet government in Nanking, Ayukawa Gisuke, former president of the South Manchuria Railway Company, and others who were arbitrarily released by MacArthur Headquarters. The Central Committee of the Chinese Communist Party believes that the US government's continued interference in China's internal affairs and its active support for the resurgence of Japanese aggression against China, despite the fact that the state of war against Japan has not yet ended, is a threat to peace in the Far East. Only by making efforts in all aspects to stop these reactionary measures of the US government can the common interests of the Chinese, American, and Japanese people be served.

　　对南京卖国政府释放日本侵华战犯
  　中共中央发表严正声明
    责令追回冈村宁次等战犯移交人民解放军
    【新华社陕北四日电】中国共产党中央委员会今日就南京国民党卖国政府释放日本侵华战犯冈村宁次返回日本，并遵循美国命令遣送已判罪之日本侵华战犯二百六十名一同返回日本一项严重问题发表声明如下：
    一九四九年一月三十一日南京国民党卖国政府的中央广播电台宣布：“一月三十一日东京讯：据确息：最近在我国军事法庭开释而为中共要求引渡的冈村宁次，已在返日途中。”同日，该政府的中央社东京英文电称：“业经中国法庭判罪的二百六十名日本战争罪犯，订于二月四日乘遣俘轮船抵达横滨，并在巢鸭监狱执行徒刑。中国代表团沈副团长称：日本战犯的移交日本，是中国政府应日本遣俘当局及战犯家属的请求而采取的措施。”此项消息，于本月二日复由国民党卖国政府伪国防部军事法庭庭长石美瑜予以证实。另据法新社东京一月三十一日电称：麦克阿瑟总部法律组组长卡尔潘特上校承认：将日本战犯自中国移交给美国方面的决定，系由麦克阿瑟将军本人所作。中国共产党中央委员会认为：中国国民党卖国政府和美国麦克阿瑟总部在关于冈村宁次及其他二百六十名日本侵华战犯问题上所采取的旨在保护日本侵华势力再起的悖谬行动，是完全违反中国人民意志和中国人民所不能承认的。中国人民曾经不顾浩大牺牲，向日本侵略军队作战八年之久，对于应对日本侵略军队各种严重罪行负主要责任的冈村宁次及其他二百六十名战犯，决不能听任事实上已不能行使职权的中国国民党卖国政府和无权过问此项问题的麦克阿瑟总部狼狈为奸，纵其逃逸。中国共产党中央委员会声明：南京国民党卖国政府应即将冈村宁次及其他日本战犯追回移交于在中国抗日战争中起主要作用者和在现时中国国防上负实际责任者中国人民解放军总部。如果此项要求未获实现，则中国人民解放军保留对于追回冈村宁次予以重行审判，并追回被移交日本的其他二百六十名日本侵华战犯的完全的权利。此外，对于被麦克阿瑟总部擅自释放的日本侵华罪魁前日本中国派遣军总司令西尾寿造，前日本华北派遣军司令多田骏，前日本华南派遣军司令安藤纪三郎，前日本驻上海海军特务机关长儿玉誉志夫，前日本驻南京伪政府大使谷正之，前日本企划院总裁、大东亚省大臣及南京伪政府最高经济顾问青木一男，前日本满洲铁道株式会社总裁鲇川义介等人，中国人民解放军同样保留要求重行审判的权利。中国共产党中央委员会认为：美国政府继续干涉中国内政的行为，以及不顾对日战争状态尚未结束而积极扶助日本侵华势力再起的行为，乃是对于远东和平的威胁。只有从各方面努力制止美国政府这些反动措施，才是符合于中国、美国、日本三国人民的共同利益的。
