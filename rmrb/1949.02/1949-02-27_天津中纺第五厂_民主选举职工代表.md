Tianjin China Textile Fifth Factory
  Democratically Elects Employee Representatives
    [Tianjin Electric] The Tianjin China Textile Fifth Factory has established a temporary employee representative council. How were the employee representatives elected?
    Before the election, the masses with a higher degree of awareness and those who were more active all hoped to elect representatives who could truly serve everyone. To prevent certain bad elements from taking advantage of the situation, the shameless behavior and attempts of these bad elements were first exposed at a mass meeting of workers, and the current victorious situation was introduced to the employees, explaining the position of the workers in state-owned enterprises today. Then, a meeting of key personnel was held, including active workers from various sections, to allow everyone to discuss how to conduct the election. At this meeting, everyone put forward many methods, such as three dos and three don'ts: (1) Don't choose the "strong arm" (thugs and henchmen); (2) Don't choose the lackeys of the old trade union; (3) Don't choose those who have connections and abuse workers through scolding and beating. Three dos: (1) Choose those who can do things for everyone; (2) Choose those who are honest and upright, with good character; (3) Choose those who are active in production and ideologically progressive. Based on these opinions of the masses, the work team inspired deliberation at various meetings, emphasizing the three dos and three don'ts proposed by the masses, and conducted in-depth ideological mobilization at meetings of activists. Through them, they further carried out widespread propaganda and mobilization among the broad masses of workers. After nine days of deliberation, the honest working masses gradually raised their heads, and the arrogance of a few bad elements was suppressed. Thus, under such conditions, the election was conducted. The election method was: taking a department or workshop as a unit, first forming groups (approximately ten people), and electing a group leader within the group. Then, one candidate was produced from every three groups, and a secret ballot election was held. Staff members were elected separately, not mixed with workers, first electing representatives and then electing group leaders.
    The results of the election: A total of 124 groups in the factory elected 50 representatives and 9 members of the standing committee (2 alternate members). Among the elected representatives, 10 were active and able to play a key role, 34 were honest, reliable, and of good character but lacked strong struggle experience, and 4 were not very pure, plus 2 staff members. Female workers accounted for 10 of those elected. The Standing Committee included 7 workers and 2 staff members.
    The general public expressed satisfaction with the election. For example, a female worker said, "This time we are truly democratic. During the Kuomintang era, we had to vote for whoever they told us to." One of the elected representatives said during his free speech, "Everyone elected me because they think highly of me. I will definitely do my best to serve everyone. If I don't do well, everyone can recall me."
    The experiences and lessons learned from this election are: (1) It is necessary to follow the mass line, and the leadership should inspire workers to consciously put forward slogans, work methods, and election conditions. (2) It is necessary to have a detailed understanding of various ideological conditions among the masses in advance, so as to grasp the core of the problem and carry out necessary propaganda and education. (3) It is necessary to go through a relatively long period of ideological deliberation in advance, and then carry out a free and democratic election when the honest workers are mobilized and the bad elements are isolated. (4) It is best to group child laborers together (the groups can be larger) to elect representatives, in order to avoid manipulation by bad elements.

### 天津中纺第五厂　民主选举职工代表

　　天津中纺第五厂
  　民主选举职工代表
    【天津电】中纺第五厂成立了职工临时代表会，职工代表是怎样产生的？
    在选举以前，觉悟程度较高，比较积极的群众，都希望选出能真正为大家服务的代表，为防止某些坏分子钻空子，首先在工人群众大会上揭穿了这些坏分子的无耻行为和企图，并向职工介绍目前的胜利形势，说明工人今天在国营企业中的地位。然后召开骨干会，包括各科积极的工人，让大家讨论如何选举。在这会上大家提出了很多的办法，如三要三不要：（一）不要胳膊根（流氓打手）；（二）不要旧工会的狗腿子；（三）不要有门有窗户的，仗势打骂工人的。三要：（一）能给大家伙办事的；（二）不徇私舞弊的，品质好的；（三）生产积极，思想进步的。工作组根据群众这些意见，在各种会上启发酝酿，强调群众提出的三要和三不要，在积极分子会上进行深入的思想动员，并通过他们再到广大工人群众中进行普遍的宣传鼓动，经过九天的酝酿，老实的工人群众逐渐抬头，少数坏分子的气焰被压下去。于是就在这样的条件下，进行选举。选举的方法是：以一部门车间为单位，首先编成小组（约十人），在小组里推选出组长。然后以三个小组产生一个候选人，进行不记名投票选举。职员则进行单独选举，不与工人混合，先选举代表后推选小组长。
    选举的结果：全厂共一百二十四个小组，选出代表五十人，常委会委员九人（两个候补委员），当选的代表中积极能起骨干作用的十人，老实可靠品质好但斗争经验不强的三十四人，不大纯洁的四人，另职员二人。女工当选的占十人。常委中有工人七人，职员二人。
    一般群众对选举表示满意。如某女工说：“咱这回可真正民主了，国民党的时候，叫咱选谁，就得选谁。”当选的一个代表在自由讲话时说：“大家选上我，是看得起我，一定好好给大家办事，如果我不好了大家罢免我。”
    从这次选举中得到的经验教训是：（一）必须走群众路线，领导启发工人自觉的提出口号、工作方法和选举条件。（二）事先必详细的了解群众中各种思想状况，然后才能把握问题的核心，进行必要的宣传教育。（三）事先必须经过较长时间的思想酝酿，等老实工人发动起来坏分子被孤立了时，再进行放手的民主选举。（四）童工最好编在一起（组可以大些），举出代表，可免去坏分子的操纵。
