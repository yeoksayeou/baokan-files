Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, February 13th: TASS, Copenhagen, February 9th: The Danish people are protesting against dragging their country into the aggressive North Atlantic bloc. A recent unemployed people's assembly in Copenhagen passed a resolution condemning the Danish government's policy of militarization. Workers at the Larsen, Aage, and Nielsen paper mills also held protest rallies and passed resolutions stating: "We firmly protest against dragging our country into a military bloc. This move will inevitably make Denmark participate in the military plans of capitalist countries." Jørgensen, a well-known professor of philosophy in Denmark, pointed out in the "People's Garden" newspaper: The policy of establishing aggressive blocs is "the greatest danger now threatening Denmark and the entire civilized world."

　　丹麦人民举行抗议大会
  　反对现政府参加大西洋集团
    【新华社陕北十三日电】塔斯社哥本哈根九日讯：丹麦人民抗议将该国拉入侵略性的北大西洋集团。哥本哈根最近举行失业者大会，通过决议，谴责丹麦现政府奉行的军事化政策。拉森、奥格、尼尔森造纸厂工人亦举行抗议大会，并通过决议称：“我们坚决抗议将我国拉入军事集团，此举将不可避免地使丹麦参加资本主义国家的军事计划。”丹麦著名哲学教授雅根森在“人民园地”报上指出：建立侵略集团的政策，是“现在威胁丹麦和整个文明世界的最大危险”。
