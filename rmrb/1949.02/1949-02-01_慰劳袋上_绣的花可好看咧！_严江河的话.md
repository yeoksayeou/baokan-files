    On the Comfort Bags
    The Embroidered Flowers are So Pretty!
    ——Yan Jianghe's Words

    Dear Uncles:
    I am the son of a Liberation Army soldier. I am studying at Rongzhen Elementary School now. I heard that you have won great victories on the front lines and liberated many large cities. The teachers are making comfort bags for you! My mother is also making them in her spare time. The embroidered flowers on the comfort bags are so pretty! My little brother, Fatty, and I played and said, "Don't cry, don't make noise, let the teachers and mother quickly finish the comfort bags and send them to the uncles on the front lines."

    Uncles! After you liberate North China, will you go south? Capture Chiang Kai-shek, and then we will be happy? He used planes to bomb us. My mother and teachers all say he is a bad guy, only doing bad things, afraid of no one except the Liberation Army.

    Uncles! Do you know my father? He is also on the front lines fighting with you. I am studying with your sons. If you are well, we are well, everyone is well. Uncles, I salute you!
  　　　　Yan Jianghe, First Grade Student, Rongzhen Elementary School, North China Military Region

    慰劳袋上
    绣的花可好看咧！
    ——严江河的话亲爱的伯伯叔叔们：
    我是解放军的儿子，我现在在荣臻小学校念书。听说你们在前方打了大胜仗，解放了很多大城市。老师正在给你们做慰问袋呢！我的妈妈也抽空在做。慰劳袋上绣的花可好看咧！我和小弟弟胖子玩说：“不要哭，不要闹，让老师和妈妈快点把慰问袋做好，给前方的叔伯们送去。”
    叔叔伯伯！你们解放了华北就南下吧？去把蒋介石捉住，我们才高兴呢？他用飞机炸过咱们。我妈妈和老师都说他是坏蛋，光办坏事，除了怕解放军外谁都不怕。
    伯伯叔叔！你们认识我的爸爸吗？他也在前方和你们在一起打仗呢，我和你们的儿子在一起学习，你们好，我们也好，大家都好。叔叔伯伯，我给你们致敬礼
  　　　　华北军区荣臻小学校一年级学生严江河
