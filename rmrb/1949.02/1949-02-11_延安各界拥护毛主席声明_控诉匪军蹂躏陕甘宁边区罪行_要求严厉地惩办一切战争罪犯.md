Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, February 9th: People from all walks of life in Yan'an held a symposium on the current situation on the 1st of this month in the conference hall of the Shaanxi-Gansu-Ningxia Border Region People's Government. Many participants, in their speeches, angrily denounced the heinous crimes of the Kuomintang bandit troops in ravaging Yan'an and the people of the Shaanxi-Gansu-Ningxia Border Region, demanded severe punishment for all war criminals, and warmly supported Chairman Mao Zedong's statement on the current situation of January 14th, opposing the Kuomintang's conspiracy to play the trick of false peace. More than fifty people attended this meeting, including people from all walks of life such as workers, peasants, intellectuals, youth, women, and enlightened gentry.

Yang Mingxuan, Vice Chairman of the Shaanxi-Gansu-Ningxia Border Region People's Government, first delivered the opening remarks at the symposium. After listing the crimes of Chiang Kai-shek and the Kuomintang reactionaries in repeatedly undermining peace agreements and carrying out a brutal counter-revolutionary civil war after Japan's surrender, he pointed out: Now the Kuomintang, in order to gain a breathing space and then make a comeback to massacre the people, has launched a conspiracy of false peace under the instigation of American imperialism; however, the bandit troops of Ma Bufang and Ma Jishou have recently continued to harass the Longdong and Guanzhong sub-districts of the Shaanxi-Gansu-Ningxia Border Region. The Chinese people, under the leadership of Chairman Mao, quickly saw through the hypocrisy of the Kuomintang's seeking peace. Vice Chairman Yang said: "Only by implementing Chairman Mao's eight peace conditions without reservation can true peace and democracy be achieved, and the people of the whole country be liberated."

Yao Anji, the mayor of Yan'an, who had consistently persisted in the struggle with the people of Yan'an in the suburbs when the Kuomintang bandit troops occupied Yan'an, said at the symposium: In one year, one month, and three days, the Kuomintang bandit troops completely destroyed 34 villages around Yan'an, creating a "no-man's land" in dozens of miles. Five citizens were killed in Dongguan in one instance, and a thirteen-year-old girl was raped and buried alive by the bandit troops. The auditorium and stone cave dwellings of Yangjialing, where the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China and Chairman Mao Zedong lived, were demolished. The people of Yan'an cannot forget this blood debt. On the evening of the Lunar New Year's Eve, many citizens ran to the municipal government anxiously and said: Chiang Kai-shek can't hold on anymore and is pretending to seek peace. This time, we must not be lenient with him. Mayor Yao also said: The people of Yan'an strongly support Chairman Mao's eight peace conditions, including the punishment of war criminals. Moreover, the people of Yan'an demand that the war criminals Hu Zongnan, Pei Changhui, Dong Zhao, He Wending, and Gu Xiping, the director of the puppet Shaanxi-North Shaanxi Administrative Office, who ravaged Yan'an and the Shaanxi-Gansu-Ningxia Border Region, be captured alive and handed over to the people of Yan'an for public trial.

Du Yanqing, Deputy Director of the Shaanxi-Gansu-Ningxia Border Region Federation of Trade Unions, denounced the crimes of the Kuomintang bandit troops in destroying the Qingliangshan Printing Factory and workers' buildings in Yan'an regarding the Kuomintang's tricks of demanding "peace" negotiations and sending so-called "peace" representatives. He pointed out sharply: After Japan's surrender, the Communist Party and the Kuomintang conducted peace negotiations. At that time, Zhang Zhizhong even said when he came to Yan'an that he hoped the CCP would not forget "Zhang Zhizhong's three visits to Yan'an" when writing history. However, later, Chiang Kai-shek broke the peace, launched a large-scale civil war, and attacked Yan'an, but Zhang Zhizhong did not say a word. Now Zhang Zhizhong is going to be a peace representative of the Nanjing reactionary government again. Such people will not talk about any true peace. Regarding the issue of punishing war criminals, Du Yanqing said: Now that we are talking about peace, if these murderers are not punished, all peace is false. Not only will the Chinese working class not agree, but every ordinary person will not agree either.

　　延安各界拥护毛主席声明
    控诉匪军蹂躏陕甘宁边区罪行
  　要求严厉地惩办一切战争罪犯
    【新华社延安九日电】延安各界人士于本月一日在陕甘宁边区人民政府会议厅举行时事座谈会。许多与会人士在发言中，愤怒地控诉了国民党匪军蹂躏延安和陕甘宁边区人民的滔天罪行，要求严厉地惩办一切战争罪犯，并热烈地拥护中共毛泽东主席一月十四日的时局声明，反对国民党玩弄假和平的阴谋。出席这个会议的有五十余人，包括了工人、农民、知识分子、青年、妇女和开明士绅等各方面的人士。
    陕甘宁边区人民政府副主席杨明轩，首先在座谈会上致开会词。他在历数蒋介石和国民党反动派于日本投降后一再破坏和平协议，进行残酷的反革命内战的罪行以后，指出：现在国民党为了取得喘息机会，然后卷土重来残杀人民，所以在美国帝国主义指使下发动了假和平的阴谋；但是马步芳、马继授匪军最近还在连续袭扰陕甘宁边区陇东分区和关中分区。中国人民在毛主席领导下，很快就看透了国民党求和的虚伪性。杨副主席说：“只有不折不扣地实行毛主席所宣布的八项和平条件，真正的和平民主才能实现，全国人民才能得到解放”。
    在国民党匪军侵占延安时，曾始终和延安人民在近郊坚持斗争的延安姚安吉市长，他在座谈会上说：国民党匪军在一年又一个月零三天中，把延安周围三十四个村庄完全摧毁了，把数十里地方造成了“无人区”，东关一次就被害死市民五人，一个十三岁的女孩被匪军强奸后活埋。中共中央和毛泽东主席住的地方——杨家岭的大礼堂和石窑洞都被拆毁了。延安人民是不能忘记这笔血债的。旧历除夕的晚上，还有很多市民跑到市政府来焦急地说：蒋介石打得撑不住了，装假求和，这次可千万不要宽容他。姚市长又说：毛主席提出了关于惩办战争罪犯等的八项和平条件，延安人民非常拥护。延安人民而且要求把蹂躏延安和陕甘宁边区的战争罪犯胡宗南、裴昌会、董钊、何文鼎和伪陕北行署主任顾希平等活活捉来，交由延安人民公审处理。
    陕甘宁边区总工会副主任杜延庆，他对于国民党要求“和平”谈判，以及派遣所谓“和平”代表等把戏，控诉了国民党匪军破坏延安清凉山印刷厂和工人建筑物的罪行。一针见血地指出：日本投降后，共产党和国民党进行和平谈判。那时张治中到延安来时还说，希望中共写历史时不要忘了“张治中三到延安”。可是，后来蒋介石破坏和平，大打内战，进攻延安，张治中却一声都不吭了。现在张治中又要做南京反动政府的求和代表了，这样的人是不会谈什么真和平的。关于惩办战争罪犯问题，杜延庆说：现在要讲和平，如果不惩办这些杀人凶犯，一切和平都是假的。这不仅中国工人阶级不答应，每一个老百姓也不答应。
