Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 16th: According to TASS Moscow, 12th, the Soviet government recently decided to hold a mechanized coal mining competition this year and has established prizes for this competition. The decision stipulates that not only will coal mine workers who do well in the complete mechanization of the coal mining process be rewarded, but also those who can most effectively utilize the equipment will be rewarded. The results of the competition will be summarized at the end of the year. This competition will play a significant role in promoting the mechanization of the entire Soviet coal mining industry.

Note: The mechanization of the coal mining process in the Soviet Union now ranks first in the world. In the years since the end of World War II, Soviet coal mines have added a large amount of new equipment with high productivity, such as coal mining machines, combined coal mining machines, coal conveying machines, powerful underground electric locomotives, and other mechanized tools. This mechanized equipment not only reduces the arduous and heavy labor of miners and saves a large amount of labor, but also greatly increases coal production. The Soviet Union now has hundreds of coal mines where the entire coal mining process is mechanized. In the Donets Basin, the largest mining area in western Soviet Union and one of the largest coal-producing areas in Europe, 96 percent of the coal mining and loading process has been mechanized. The Soviet government is now striving to fully mechanize all coal mines. Relying on mechanization and labor competitions, the Soviet coal mining industry will victoriously achieve the goals of the post-war Five-Year Plan, producing 250 million tons of coal in 1950. In another two Five-Year Plans, the Soviet Union will achieve the great goal of producing 500 million tons of coal annually.

　　采煤机械化已占世界第一位
  　苏举行机械化采煤竞赛           
    以促进全国煤矿完全机械化
    【新华社陕北十六日电】据塔斯社莫斯科十二日讯：苏联政府顷决定今年举行机械化采煤竞赛，并为这一竞赛设立了奖金。决定规定，不仅在采煤过程全部机械化方面做得好的煤矿职工可以受奖，同时，能够最有效地利用装备的也将得到奖励。竞赛结果将在年底作总结。这一竞赛对于促进苏联全部采煤工业的机械化，将起很大作用。
    按：苏联采煤过程的机械化，现已占世界第一位。在第二次大战结束后的几年来，苏联的煤矿已增加了大量有高度生产力的新装备，如挖煤机、复合采煤机，运煤机，强有力的地下电气机车及其他机械化的工具。这些机械化的装备，不仅减轻了矿工艰辛沉重的劳动，节省了大量劳动力，而且大大地增加了煤产量。苏联现在已有几百处采煤过程全部机械化的煤矿。在苏联西部最大的矿区、欧洲最大的产煤区之一的顿尼兹盆地，采煤和装车过程已有百分之九十六机械化。苏联政府现正努力使全部煤矿完全机械化。依靠机械化和劳动竞赛，苏联的采煤工业将要胜利地实现战后五年计划的目标，在一九五○年将采煤二亿五千万吨。再有两个五年计划，苏联即将达到每年产煤五万万吨的伟大目标。
