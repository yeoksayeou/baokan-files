　　Propaganda on the Situation Combined with Celebrating Merits and Giving Preferential Treatment to Servicemen
  　400 Demobilized Soldiers in Eastern Hebei Return to Their Units
    [Eastern Hebei Electric Dispatch] Eastern Hebei regions universally launched work to bring back soldiers to their units around the New Year. Due to the infrequent work of giving preferential treatment to military families in the past, harming middle peasants during land redistribution, and insufficient troop management and education, some soldiers deserted. Amidst the victorious situation of the Northeast Army entering the customs and liberating all of Eastern Hebei, work to bring soldiers back was conducted in conjunction with supporting the army and giving preferential treatment to families. As of the Lunar New Year, according to incomplete statistics, 400 demobilized servicemen in Fengrun, Baodi, Qian'an, and other counties had voluntarily returned to their units. The following experiences were gained in the work of bringing soldiers back: (1) Utilize the victorious situation to widely carry out propaganda and mobilization, explaining that the revolution is about to achieve victory nationwide, and everyone should make a final effort to carry the revolution through to the end. (2) Closely integrate the work of celebrating merits and giving preferential treatment to families, and earnestly solve the difficulties of military families in production and life. In some villages in Lulong County, the masses gathered firewood and manure for military families, went to market, and women helped military families with needlework, creating a warm wave of giving preferential treatment, and within a few days, 47 demobilized soldiers voluntarily returned to their units. Establish the glorious status of military families. After the work of celebrating merits was carried out, the families of meritorious personnel felt supremely honored. Other military families envied the glory of others' sons or husbands for earning merits and encouraged their sons or husbands to stay in the army with peace of mind, fight the enemy, and earn merits. Some families of demobilized servicemen voluntarily persuaded their children to return to their units as soon as possible. Qian'an County combined the celebration of merits for eight meritorious personnel, and in just six days, more than 180 demobilized soldiers returned to their units, thus opening up the situation for the work of bringing soldiers back. (3) Thoroughly clear up the thinking of district and village cadres and instruct the Party branches to ensure the completion of tasks. Local cadres and military cadres cooperate closely, with unified leadership and unified action. (4) Cultivate key members to take the lead in returning to their units. Baodi County educated the returnees who had arrived in the county and formed them into key groups to carry out mobilization work in various villages. One group mobilized 18 returnees to return to their units the day after arriving in the village. (5) Appropriately combine with rectifying policies. For example, Jia Xueming, a middle peasant from Huangxinzhuang in Baodi, deserted because he was wrongly struggled against. This time, the masses removed his label as a struggling household, returned his original house, and continued to compensate for other materials, and he voluntarily returned to his unit. Some said, "My class status has been clarified, and I feel at ease. I have to set an example after returning to the team." (6) Strictly avoid the work style of coercion and command. For example, the second and fourth districts of Qian'an adopted a method of half persuasion and half coercion. Some of the returnees were still not well consolidated and caused fear among other deserters, resulting in failure.

　　宣传形势结合庆功优军
  　冀东四百离队战士归队
    【冀东电】冀东各地新旧年关前后普遍展开归队工作。由于过去对优待军人家属工作不经常、与平分中伤害中农，以及部队管理教育作的不够，因而部队上发生一些战士离队现象。在东北大军进关解放全冀东的胜利形势下，结合拥军优属，进行了归队工作。截至旧历年前，据不完全统计：丰润、宝坻、迁安等县已有四百名离队军人自动归队。在归队工作中获得如下几点经验：（一）利用胜利形势广泛进行宣传动员讲明，革命眼看就要在全国取得胜利，大家再努最后一把劲，把革命进行到底。（二）密切结合庆功、优属工作，切实解决军属生产及生活上的困难，卢龙县有些村群众给军属拾柴、拾粪，赶集，妇女帮助军属做针线活，造成优属热潮，几天工夫就有四十七名离队战士自动归队。树立军属的光荣地位，庆功工作开展以后，功臣家属感到无尚光荣。其他军属羡慕别家子弟立功光荣，都纷纷给自己的儿子或丈夫去信以鼓励其安心作战，杀敌立功，有些离队军人家属，便自动说服自己的子弟早日归队。迁安县结合给八个功臣庆功，仅六天中就有一百八十多名离队战士归队，从而打开了归队工作的局面。（三）彻底打通区村干部的思想，并责成党的支部保证完成任务，地方干部与部队干部密切合作，统一领导，统一行动。（四）培养归队骨干分子带头归队，宝坻县把已到县的归队人员经过教育后编成骨干小组，到各村进行动员工作，一组到村后第二天即动员了十八名归队战士归队。（五）适当结合端正政策，如宝坻黄辛庄中农贾学明，因被错斗开了小差，这次群众给他摘掉被斗户的帽子，退回原房子，并继续赔偿其他物资，他就自动归队了。有的说：“我的成份弄清楚，我算安心了，我回队后得干个样看看”。（六）严格避免强迫命令的工作作风，如迁安二、四等区，采用了一半说服一半强迫的办法，有些归队人员仍不好巩固，并造成其他离队人员的恐惧，结果失败。
