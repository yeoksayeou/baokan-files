　　The Growing New Democratic Youth League of North China
　　North China Bureau Youth Committee

　　The New Democratic Youth League of North China has been around for over two years, from its trial phase to the present, and it has now become an organization that is valued by everyone.

　　In 1946, the New Democratic Youth League began its trial in Pingshan, Quyang, and Dingxian, establishing ten branches. During the land reform review period in 1947, Dingxian adopted key experiments and established ten branches. After the equitable land distribution began in December 1948, Dingxian and Pingshan began to comprehensively experiment with league building, while other regions also conducted piecemeal experiments. Since then, various regions have begun to pay attention to the work of league building. By the time the North China Youth Representative Conference was held in November 1948, the membership had grown to about 20,000. The conference decided to focus on comprehensively developing the work of league building. Currently, various regions are conducting the communication of decisions and large-scale training of cadres.

　　Although the number of Youth League members is currently not large, it has been valued by everyone. This is mainly because, under the leadership of the Communist Party, league members can work hard in their respective work positions, and many league members strive to make progress and become glorious Communist Party members.

　　　　The Youth League in Rural Areas

　　The rural areas of the old liberated areas are where we first started building the league. During the initial trial period, league members demonstrated the heroic posture of the peasants. For example, the league in Wende Village, Quyang, led the masses to break through the Dingxian city, and the league members bravely took the lead in completing the task. During the review, when the league was established in Dingxian, Youth League members also led the broad masses of young people to overcome personal relationships and participate in the struggle, especially in monitoring landlords, guarding floating wealth, and being very active in summoning people. In the equitable land distribution, they became an active force in leading the broad masses of young people to fight against the landlords. After being tempered by the equitable distribution movement, the development and role of the league have further advanced. In military service, after the league was established in Pingshan, 145 league members joined the army. According to incomplete statistics, 131 people joined the army during the first expansion in Dingxian. In military service, league members not only generally did not evade, but also led the broad masses of young people to join the army, and many model deeds emerged. In supporting the front lines, the general performance was very good. For example, league members in Chenzhuangzi, Dingxian, volunteered to sign up to carry stretchers to the Tianjin front. Male and female league members in Dayangping, Dingxian, all voluntarily participated in road repairs. League members in Mingyuedian led the masses to complete seven days of road repair support tasks within five days. Li Chunyan, a female league member in Lujiazhuang, heard that wounded soldiers had arrived in the village in the middle of the night, got up and found fifty eggs to cook for the patients, and even carried stretchers to send them off when they left. In production, league members generally performed actively, and many were praised by their families. Those who were not very diligent in their work in the past have developed good work attitudes after joining the league. League members also unite the masses in production. For example, during the autumn harvest and wheat planting last year in Dingxian, 100 branches organized 324 production mutual aid groups, including 1,021 households and 1,450 people, of which 763 were league members. Last winter, under the leadership of 29 league members in the Fourth District of the Sixth District, 16 production groups for spinning, weaving, and making brooms were established, with 71 young people participating. In cultural learning, of the 92 people's schools in Pingshan, 62 were led by the league. There are people's school study groups in Dingxian, with a total of 241 villages and 1,074 people participating, of which 190 league branches have played a leading role. In paying public grain, the Youth League also played a model role. For example, Zhang Fushan, Zhang Hutong, and Zhang Chunshan, league members in Yangyao Village, Dingxian, paid particularly early. Under the leadership of league members, the village commune collected 90% of the grain in two days. The masses in Liuzao West and Pingzhu Valley praised the league members for paying early and broadcasted this matter at the market and posted it on the blackboard newspaper for praise. In Dingxian, the league played a significant role in the publicity work and transportation work during the collection. In party rectification, they reflected the real situation. For example, during the party rectification in Liangcheng Village, Yangcheng County, league members actively helped the party, publicized the party rectification's principles, purposes, and significance, and also made self-criticisms. Many league members were recommended by the masses to join the Communist Party after party rectification. For example, in Majiazhai, Dingxian, four people were recommended and joined the party after being approved by the party.

　　　　The Youth League in Schools

　　The Youth League in schools showed that they were outstanding students under the new democratic education. For example, Li Jinhua, Ma Sailong, and others, league members in Taihang Second Middle School, were liberated peasants with low levels of education. After joining the league, they fully developed the spirit of mutual assistance and love and worked hard to study. During the Jinzhong Campaign, the male students with good health all went to the front lines to serve, until Cheng Shou was captured. When the semester was summarized, 86 of the 95 model students in the school were league members. The league members of Shijiazhuang Normal School are all students who actively study. When the Kuomintang army attempted to attack Shijiazhuang by surprise, all the students rose up to prepare for war. League members also played a model role everywhere during the march. The heroic models in the contribution movement in the North China University of Finance and Economics created many model classes. The group leaders are mostly league members. In the ideological study movement, league members first launched a heart-to-heart talk movement, inspiring many comrades to frankly examine their historical stains. Many people talked about having joined the Kuomintang, the Three People's Principles Youth League, and the Comrades Association.

　　　　The Youth League in Factories

　　The league has not been established in many factories, but it can be fully seen that the worker league members are good sons and daughters of the proletariat, and they have shown a high degree of love for their factories. For example, the league in the Shijiazhuang Prosperity Factory guaranteed unity of the masses in production, worked according to the standards put forward by the factory, and did not slack off. In the shift competition, league members were scattered in various workshops, uniting the masses to strive for models. In the three-month competition, two-thirds of the Youth League members won the red flag. Li Shuyan, who led the yarn car, won the award three times in a row. Li Shuyan led her colleagues to not be absent from work or ask for leave during air raids, and returned to production on the car immediately after the alarm was lifted. In terms of learning, because league members worked hard to study and helped the masses, many of the heads of the trade union's study groups became league members. Those with higher levels of culture also engaged in cultural education work. In addition, the cadres of the Youth League also served in clubs and other jobs. When the Kuomintang bandit army attempted to move south, when the entire factory was fighting, before the work was stopped, 47 league members, except for 3 who were evacuated with their families, all remained at their posts. When disassembling the machines, the league members worked continuously for 16 hours, and the female league members also stubbornly completed the task. When the situation was tense, league member Liu Changming and others voluntarily took guns and stood guard. Almost all the male league members transported the machines at night. Bian Yongxing did not sleep for three days while disassembling the machines. Liu Changming had a leg disease, but he still transported machines all night. When the factory was transferred, all the league members, except for two who were unable to break free from family constraints, all transferred with the factory. In the war preparedness summary, 12 league members won award flags, one league cadre received a special award, and no league member was criticized or punished. Another example is the Youth League of the Shide and Zhengtai Railways, which, together with the trade union, launched a production competition and consolidated labor discipline. When donating labor and salary to support the workers in the Jiang area, the Youth League group of the Public Works Section first cooperated with the trade union to publish a quick report, leading the workers of the entire section to respond to the call. League members of the Railway Hospital took the lead in changing the style of medical care. At the meeting of drivers and stokers, some people said backward words, and league members patiently explained to him the facts of who was truly serving the people. Last September, enemy planes bombed Shijiazhuang, and most of the league members participated in defense. During the transfer of the machine factory in the war preparation, league member Wei Guandian came to Jiangtou to sign up to escort. The league members who went to Yuci seriously publicized the new area's industrial and commercial policies. They also played an active role in repairing the railway. At the first congress of the Tenth Day Railway, three league members were honorably elected as worker representatives.

　　　　The League is Growing and Expanding

　　The league's influence has made the broad masses of young people raise their awareness and enthusiastically request to join the league. For example, during the equitable distribution movement in Dingxian, after full preparation, young people in various villages applied to join the league in batches. In the past one or two months, after certain procedures, more than 4,000 young people joined the league. In Fuping, the league's influence is also expanding, and even many middle-aged people are applying to join the league. After the war preparation in the Shijiazhuang Prosperity Factory, 25 people applied to join the league. As a result, 19 people gloriously became Youth League members.

　　However, there are also shortcomings in the league building work in North China. For example, the league building during the equitable distribution movement in Huolu and Lingshou was simply a matter of compiling the young people. Some also regarded the conditions for joining the league as too strict, which led to the mistake of closed-doorism. Some places did not do enough publicity work about the league, which made it difficult to carry out the league's work. Some league building was divorced from the central work of the time and place and engaged in a separate set of things. Some leagues were established, but the leadership did not grasp it firmly, so that the regular work of the league was not established, which led to insufficient vitality of the league, and even to the point of collapse in the end. But these shortcomings are secondary from the overall point of view, and most of them are gradually being overcome.

　　在成长中的华北新民主主义青年团
    华北局青委会
    华北新民主主义青年团，自试办到现在已有两年多的历史，现已成为大家所重视的一个组织了。
    一九四六年，平山、曲阳、定县开始试办新民主主义青年团，建立了十个支部。一九四七年土地改革复查时期，定县采取重点试验，建立了十个支部。一九四八年十二月平分土地以后开始，定县、平山开始普遍试验建团，其他地区也零碎的试验。自此以后，各地也开始注意到建团的工作，到一九四八年十一月召开华北青年代表会时，团员已发展到二万左右。会议决定有重点的、全面开展建团工作。现在各地正进行传达决定和大批训练干部。
    青年团数量目前虽还不大，但已为大家所重视。主要是因为团在共产党领导下，团员们都能站在不同的工作岗位上努力工作，而且许多团员都努力求进步争取做一个光荣的共产党员。
    　　　　农村里的青年团
    革命的老解放区农村，是我们首先开始建团的地方。在开始试验时期，团员就表现了农民们英雄的姿态。如曲阳文德村的团就带动了群众去破定县城，团员奋勇当先的完成任务。复查时在定县建立了团，青年团员也带动广大青年群众破除情面参加斗争，特别在监视地主，看守浮财，召集人跑腿上十分积极。平分土地中，更成为带动广大青年向地主斗争的积极力量。经过平分运动的锻炼，以后团的发展和作用更向前进了一步。参军中，平山建团以后，有一百四十五个团员参加军队。定县第一次扩军据不完全统计，参军的有一百三十一个。团员在参军中不仅一般的不逃避，还能带动广大青年参军，曾出现了许多模范事迹。在支援前线上，一般表现是很好的，如定县陈庄子团员自动报名抬担架到平津前线。定县大羊平男女团员全部自动参加修路，明月店团员带动群众在五天内完成七天的修路支援前线任务。吕家庄女团员李春燕半夜里听到村里来了伤病员，就起来找了五十个鸡蛋给病号做饭，走时还抬担架去送。在生产上团员一般都表现积极，有不少得到家庭称赞。过去做活不大勤劳的，入团以后就有了好的劳动态度。团员还团结群众生产，如定县去年收秋种麦时，一百个支部组织了三百二十四个生产互助小组，其中包括一千零二十一户，一千四百五十人，而团员就有七百六十三人。去年冬季生产，六区四小区在团员二十九名带动下建立纺织，编织，做条帚的十六个生产小组中有七十一个青年群众参加。在文化学习上，平山九十二座民校，其中六十二座是团领导的。定县有民校学习组，共有二百四十一个村，共有一千零七十四人参加，其中已有一百九十个团支部起了带头作用。在缴公粮时，青年团也起了模范作用。如定县杨咬村团员张福山、张胡同、张春山缴的特别早，在团员带动下，这村公社两天征收了百分之九十。留早西、平朱谷群众都称赞团员缴的早，并把这事在集上广播，写在黑板报上表扬。定县在征收中的宣传工作、运送工作，团部起了很大作用。在整党中，反映真实情况，如阳城县梁城村整党中，团员积极帮助党，宣传整党的方针、目的、意义，自己也做检讨，有不少团员经过整党后被群众推荐加入共产党。如定县马家寨就有四个被推荐经党批准后入了党。
    　　　　学校里的青年团
    学校中的青年团，表现了他们是新民主主义教育下的优秀学生，如太行二中团员李金华、马赛龙等是翻身农民，原来文化低，加入团后充分地发扬了互助友爱的精神，而且努力学习。晋中战役时，男生身体好的都上前线服务，一直到把承绶捉住。当学期总结时，全校九十五个模范学生，其中八十六个是团员。石家庄师范学校的团员都是学习积极的学生。当国民党军妄图偷击石家庄时，全体同学奋起备战。行军中团员也处处起模范作用。华北财经学院立功运动中出许多英雄模范，创造了许多模范班。组长多是团员。在思想学习运动中团员首先展开了谈心运动，启发了许多同志坦白检讨自己历史污点，不少人谈出自己曾加入过国民党、三青团、同志会。
    　　　　工厂里的青年团
    团在工厂里建立的还不多，但已可充分看出职工团员是无产阶级的好儿女，他们对自己的工厂表现了高度的热爱。例如石家庄繁荣厂的团在生产中保证团结群众，按照工厂提出的标准去工作，不偷懒。分车竞赛中，团员分散在各车间，团结群众争取模范。三个月的竞赛中，青年团员有三分之二的人得了红旗。一连得三次奖的就是团员李淑砚领导的纱车。李淑砚带动同车人在空袭时不旷工不告假，警报解除后马上回车生产。学习方面因团员的学习努力，帮助群众，工会的学习小组长就多成了团员。文化高的还搞文化教育工作。此外青年团的干部还担任了俱乐部和其他工作。在国民党匪军企图南下，全厂作战时，停工前，四十七个团员，除三个随家疏散外，其余全部未离职。在拆卸机器时，团员们连续做了十六小时的工，女团员也顽强的完成了任务。情况紧张时，团员刘长明等自动拿枪站岗。男团员几乎全部在夜间押运机器。边永兴在拆卸机器中三天没睡觉。刘长明脚有病，他还押运机器走一整夜。工厂转移时，全部团员除两人未能摆脱家庭束缚外，其余全部都随厂转移。作备战总结时，团员十二人得了奖旗，有一个团干部受了特奖，团员中没有一个受批评处分的。又如石德、正太铁路的青年团，和职工会共同发动了生产竞赛巩固了劳动纪律。在为支援蒋区职工捐工捐薪时，工务段青年团小组首先和工会配合出版快报，领导全段职工响应号召。铁路医院团员带头改变了医护作风，司机司炉工人会上，有人说落后话，团员就耐心的给他说明谁是真正为人民服务的事实。去年九月敌机轰炸石家庄，团员大部参加防护，备战中在机厂转移时，团员魏贯电来江头报名护送。到榆次的团员曾认真的宣传新区的工商政策。在修复铁路中也起了积极作用。十日铁路首届代表大会，有三个团员光荣的被选为工人代表。
    　　　　团在成长和壮大中
    团的影响所及，使得广大的青年提高了觉悟，热烈的要求入团。如定县平分运动时经过充分的准备，各村青年成批的申请入团，前后一两个月中，经过一定手续，入团的青年共有四千多名。在阜平团的影响也在扩大，甚至有不少壮年也申请入团。石家庄繁荣厂备战后就有二十五名申请入团。结果有十九个人光荣地成了青年团员。
    但华北建团工作也是有缺点的。如获鹿、灵寿平分运动时的建团，只是简单的把青年们编制了一下。也有的把入团条件看的过严，以致犯了关门主义。也有的地方关于团的宣传工作做的不够，使团的工作难以进行。也有的建团脱离开当时当地的中心工作，另搞一套。也有的团建立起来了，但领导没抓紧，使团的经常工作没树立起来，以致团的生气不足，甚至到最后弄得垮台。但这些缺点从整个来看是次要的，而且大部正在逐渐克服。
