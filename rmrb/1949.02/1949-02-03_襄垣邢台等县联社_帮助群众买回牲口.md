　　[Taihang Electric Dispatch] All counties in this area have paid attention to helping the masses increase their livestock purchases during the winter production. The joint cooperatives of counties such as Heshun, the Fifth District Office of Xingtai, and especially the joint cooperative of Xiangyuan County have begun to focus on specifically helping the masses solve their livestock power difficulties. Their method is not to buy and sell livestock among themselves in one location, but to go to places that produce livestock or have a relatively large number of livestock and buy them back in bulk to sell to the masses. Last winter, the Heshun County Joint Cooperative bought back 106 head of livestock from northwestern Shanxi. In order to solve the livestock power difficulties of the masses, the Fifth District Office of Xingtai specifically organized the masses of Yangfan Town and other villages to transport local products such as towels, homespun cloth, and cigarettes to Ningwu, Wutai in northwestern Shanxi, and Dingbian County in Shaanxi to exchange for livestock. The number has increased from more than 40 in the past to more than 500. Farmers in Xingtai, Shahe, and Ren counties have also come here to purchase. The Xiangyuan County Joint Cooperative went to Lin County, a major livestock producing area in northwestern Shanxi, to purchase livestock for sale in the county. The first batch was planned for 28 head, including four horses. Because they were authentic goods, the masses scrambled to buy them. One person in Guozhuang bought a donkey. Li Huangzheng from Nangou Village said, "If I had known they were authentic goods, I would have bought one earlier." The ten head brought to the city market were sold out in two days. The second batch is almost back, and the plan is to buy a third batch. It is expected that 250 head will be purchased before the spring plowing. The cooperative had a relatively accurate calculation beforehand. The county's total land area is over 748,000 mu, but there are only 10,170 head of livestock, with each head averaging 73.6 mu of cultivated land; two head of livestock per plow, each plow needing to cultivate 88.64 mu; the Sixth District needs to cultivate an average of 86.8 mu. In order to develop the county's productive forces, it was decided to purchase livestock from outside. Xijiujia Village in the Third District of Shahe has also done a good job, having bred 31 small livestock in the past nine months. Facts in various places prove that the masses urgently need to increase livestock, but in many places, the increase in livestock has been affected by the lack of effective assistance from the leadership. These facts on the one hand illustrate the urgency of the masses' demand for livestock, and on the other hand, reflect that the solutions in various places are not effective enough. For example, some households sell livestock because they dislike the heavy corvée labor, while households that lack livestock now buy livestock, but then sell them again when they see the disadvantages of corvée labor. As a result, livestock are bought during busy farming seasons and sold during slack seasons, forming a cycle of mutual buying and selling in the nearby areas.

　　襄垣邢台等县联社
  　帮助群众买回牲口
    【太行电】此间冬产中各县都注意了帮助群众增买牲口。和顺县联社、邢台五区署、特别是襄垣县联社，都开始注意具体的帮助群众解决畜力困难。他们的办法不是在一个地方互相买卖牲口，而是去产牲口或牲口比较多的地方，成批买回，卖给群众。和顺县联社去冬到晋西北买回牲口一百零六头。邢台五区署为解决群众畜力困难，特组织羊范镇等村群众，将土产毛巾、土布、纸烟等，运到晋西北宁武、五台和陕西定边等县，换回牲口，已由过去四十多头，增至五百余头。邢台、沙河、任县农民，亦都来此地购买。襄垣县县联社到产牲口多的晋西北临县一带，购买牲口回县出售，第一批计划二十八头，马四匹。因为是地道货，群众争相购买，郭庄一人买了一头驴。南沟村李黄蒸说：“要知道是地道货，可该去早买一头。”赶在城内集上的十头，两天就卖光了。第二批已快回来，计划去买第三批。预计在春耕前要买二百五十头。该社事先即有较精确的计算，全县土地为七十四万八千余亩，牲口只有一万零一百七十头，每头平均耕地七十三亩六分一；两头牲口一张犁，每张犁须耕八十八亩六分四；六区平均须耕八十六亩八。为发展全县生产力，决定出外购买牲口。沙河三区西九家村，过去九个月内繁殖了三十一头小牲口，也是很好的做法。各地事实证明，群众是十分需要增加牲口的，但不少地方因领导上帮助的办法不够有效，使牲口增加受到一些影响。这些事实一方面说明了群众要求牲口的迫切，另一方面也反映了各地解决的办法不够有效。如有些家户嫌支差繁重而卖牲口，现在缺乏牲口户则是买牲口，等看到支差吃亏，又把牲口转卖了。结果，农忙买牲口，闲了卖牲口，形成了在附近地区互相买卖。
