Criticism and Suggestions

　　Please Pay Attention to Checking Work Style at the Xinhua Bookstore in Yuci
　　To the Editor:
　　We are all young people under twenty, eager to see a publication about youth. We suddenly saw the pre-publication announcement of "China Youth" in the newspaper and decided to subscribe to several copies. So we went to inquire at the North China Xinhua Bookstore (in Yuci). The first time, they said they were not ready yet, and asked us to come back tomorrow. The next morning, we went to pre-order again. As soon as we entered, the comrades at the Xinhua Bookstore said again that they were not ready and asked us to come back tomorrow. The third evening, when we went again, those comrades were gathered around the stove and said impatiently: Come back in three days! After another three days, we went to pre-order again, and they said to order it three days later! I had to come back disappointed. After three or four days, we sent someone to order it again, and they said very unhappily: No business is done outside of office hours. Not only do they treat us this way, but they also treat the general public who come in to buy books with indifference. We believe that this bureaucratic work style must be changed.

　　请在榆次的新华书店
    注意检查作风编辑同志：
    我们都是不上二十岁的青年，渴望着能够看到一部关于青年的刊物，忽然在报纸上看到了“中国青年”的预计启事，决心要订几份。于是向华北新华书店去打听（在榆次），头一次人家说我们还没有准备好，请明天来吧。第二天清早我们又去预订，当我们一进门新华书店的同志又说还没有准备好，请明天再来吧。第三天的晚上，我们又去时，那些同志在火炉边围着，很不耐烦的说：三天以后再来吧！又过了三天我们又去预订，又说再迟三天订吧！我只好失望的又回来。过了三、四天我们又派人去订，他们便很不高兴的说：不在办公时间不办公。他们不唯对待我们是这样，就对待一般人进去买书，也是待理不理的样子。我们认为这种官僚主义作风，是须要改掉的。　　　　　（王潮、薛积福、常志年）
