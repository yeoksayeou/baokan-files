　　Victorious Advance

　　On the evening of December 22nd, after the artillery fire that annihilated the enemy's 35th Army at Xinbao'an ceased, the soldiers spent two days resting, wiping the soot from their weapons and the blood from their bayonets. At dawn on the 25th, they received orders to carry out a new mission and began another great march.

　　Before dawn, assembly calls resounded everywhere, and the assembly grounds were filled with dark figures. The commander stood before everyone and shouted forcefully: "Comrades, today we are going to carry out a new mission. Friendly forces to the west have completely annihilated the enemy defending Zhangjiakou. The higher command has ordered us to use a three-day march to cut off the enemy's retreat from Datong and encircle and annihilate them. This is an arduous and glorious task." The snowflakes fell harder and harder, and the earth was a vast expanse of white. The troops began to advance, the snow crunching under their feet. The pure white snowflakes, after being trampled by the troops in rows, left several gray-black bands stretching to the southwest.

　　The next day, the sky cleared, and the sun reflected a rosy glow. The troops had just arrived at their campsite at midnight and were to set off again at dawn. It was difficult to recover from fatigue with only five hours of rest, especially since today's journey was even longer and the departure had to be earlier. Some units were issued half a jin of roasted soybeans per person to eat on the road.

　　Three columns advanced in parallel on the highway, with carts, pack animals, and artillery vehicles mixed in the ranks, forming a black-green wall that stretched across the vast wilderness. Occasionally, six-wheeled trucks passed by, gifts from the 35th Army. The drivers, who had just come over three days ago, also joined the ranks of this revolutionary army, gripping the steering wheels and carrying large quantities of supplies forward. At the major rest stops, each unit cooked thin porridge. After a day's march, everyone was indeed a little hungry. After the meal, everyone was discussing: "Today's thin porridge is even sweeter than a feast!" It's true, those who have never been hungry probably wouldn't know.

　　Winter days are short and nights are long. They only traveled eighty li in a day, and there was still half the journey to go. Continuing to advance in the dark, comrades who were weak or sick couldn't hold on, and some simply sat down in the snow. "Cowards and weaklings, heroes and good men, it all depends on tonight!" The powerful slogan encouraged everyone to cheer up and walk again.

　　The cold wind of the frontier penetrated the soldiers' cotton coats. The cotton trousers, soaked with sweat during the day, were covered with a thin layer of snow and had frozen as hard as iron. Because they were cold and hungry, the troops didn't dare to take rests longer than fifteen minutes. As soon as they stopped, the snow became everyone's sleeping mat. By the time the advance call woke people up, they felt numb all over from the cold. The high degree of class friendship was even more evident in times of difficulty, with everyone vying to carry each other's belongings. The physically strong supported the comrades with sore feet. Although their feet wobbled a bit on the hard ice ground, the troops still marched forward closely.

　　At dawn, they crossed the Sanggan River, and the sky gradually brightened. One could see that everyone's scarves, masks, and hats were covered with frost like white flowers. The Sanggan Riverbed was very wide, and the foot-thick ice was frozen solid. Pack animals, artillery, etc., were all unloaded and pushed across the river like ice skating. The ice was very slippery, and many animals fell. The soldiers were busy lifting the animals, and some were even playing ice skating games.

　　There were still fifteen li to go after crossing the river. After twenty-four hours of marching, they finally arrived at their campsite. The smile of victory was revealed on everyone's face. Hardship could not suppress the will to fight. The three-day march was successfully completed.

　　The troops advanced to the outskirts of Datong to assemble and await orders. Some of the comrades who had participated in the Datong offensive in 1946 even stayed in the homes of their original landlords. The villagers warmly welcomed us, clearing warm kangs (heated platforms) and helping to heat water for foot baths. They hadn't seen us for two years and seemed even closer, telling us about the oppression they had suffered under the Yan bandit (Yan Xishan) in the past two years.

　　Coincidentally, a new order came in the middle of the night: "The troops will depart at dawn, advance northeast, and participate in the Pingjin Campaign." Everyone jumped up happily again. Comrade Zuo Xiulin, a messenger, shouted: "It doesn't matter, let's go! We'll fight wherever we're needed!"

　　From Datong to Beiping, the advance along the Ping-Sui Railway was more than eight hundred li, but under the encouragement of victory and joy, all fatigue was forgotten, and even Little San (nickname), whose feet hurt, jumped up. The long column appeared again on the undulating mountains and highways.

　　"The characteristic of the People's Army is that it is good at overcoming difficulties. This is a powerful guarantee of defeating the enemy." A squad leader explained to a new soldier whose feet were hurting.

　　After seven days of continuous marching back and forth, covering a distance of six hundred and eighty li, they finally boarded a long train in the new Zhangjiakou – a city of the people. Loud singing resounded in the carriages.

　　胜利的进军
    吴旭文
    十二月二十二日黄昏，聚歼新保安敌三十五军的炮声停止后，战士们在两天休息中，擦拭了武器上的烟尘，揩去了刺刀上的鲜血，二十五号拂晓奉命执行新的任务，又开始大进军了。
    天还未亮，到处响着集合的号音，集合场上站满了黑黝黝的人群，指挥员站在大家面前有力的喊着：“同志们：我们今天又要执行新的任务了，西面友军已全歼张垣守敌，上级命令我们要以三日行程截断大同敌之归路，包围与歼灭该敌。这是一个艰巨光荣的任务。”雪花越下越紧了，大地上白茫茫一片。部队开始前进了，雪在脚底下吱吱作响，洁白的雪絮，经部队一列列的踏过后，留下数条灰黑色的带子，伸向西南。
    翌日天已放晴，太阳映出一片红霞。午夜部队刚到达宿营地，拂晓又要出发，休息五个钟头是很难恢复疲劳的，何况今日的路程更远，出发还要提前，有的单位，每人发了半斤炉黄豆，准备路上充饥。
    公路上三路纵队并进，大车、驮子、炮车，掺杂在行列里，形成一条黑绿色的城墙，蔓延于辽阔的原野上，时有六轮的大卡车通过，这是三十五军的礼物。刚过来三天的司机员，也加入了这革命部队的行列，紧握着轮盘，载着大批辎重前进。到大休息的地方，各单位都烧了稀饭，一天的行军的确有些饿了，饭后大家都在议论着：“今天的稀粥比会餐还香甜哩！”真是这样，没有挨过饿的人恐怕是很难知道的。
    冬天昼短夜长，一天才走了八十里，路程还有一半，在黑夜里继续前进，体力弱或带病的同志撑不住了，有的便坐在雪地里。“稀泥软蛋，英雄好汉全看这一夜了！”有力的口号，使大家振作了精神又走了起来。
    塞外的寒风侵透了战士们的棉衣，白天被汗湿过了的棉裤沾上了一层薄雪，已冻成铁一样的僵硬，因为又冷又饿，部队都不敢作十五分钟以上的休息，刚停下来，雪地上便成了大家的睡铺，待前进号将人们催醒的时候，冻的已感浑身麻木。高度的阶级友爱，在困难的时候更为明显，大家互相抢背东西。体力壮的扶着脚疼的同志，脚踏在冰硬的地上虽有些摇幌，但部队仍紧促的前进着。
    拂晓横跨桑乾河，天渐渐亮了。可以看到每人围脖的手巾、口罩、帽子、结上了白花似的霜冰。桑乾河床很宽，尺厚的冰已经结死，驮子、大炮等都卸下来滑冰似的向对岸推进。冰很光，不少牲口都滑倒了，战士们有的忙着抬牲口，有的还作着滑冰的游戏。
    过河后还有十五华里，二十四小时的行军，终于到达宿营地了，胜利的微笑流露在每个人的脸上，艰苦压不倒战斗的意志，三天的行军胜利完成了。
    部队进至大同近郊集结待命。参加过一九四六年大同攻击战的同志，有的竟住了原先的老房东家，老乡们热情地欢迎着我们，腾暖炕、帮着烧烫脚水，两年不见显得更亲近了，向我们诉说两年来受阎匪压榨的情形。
    巧的很，半夜又传来了新的命令：“部队拂晓出发，向东北挺进，参加平津大会战。”大家又欢乐的跳起来，通讯员左秀林同志喊着：“没关系，走！那里须要打到那里去！”
    大同到北平，沿平绥路前进总有八百余里，但在胜利与欢笑的鼓舞下一切疲劳都忘记了，脚疼的小三也跳了起来。长长的行列又出现在山岭起伏的公路上。
    “人民军队的特点：是善于克服困难，这是战胜敌人的有力保证”。一个班长和一个走得脚疼的新战士解释着。
    七日往返连续进军，行程六百八十里，终在新的张家口——人民的城市登上了长长的列车，车箱里响起宏亮的歌声。
