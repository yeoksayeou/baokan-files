　　North China Leading Organs
  　Rush to Produce Comfort Bags Day and Night
    Putting Playing Cards Inside
    To Help the Soldiers Relax
    [Our News] To celebrate the liberation of Peiping and Tientsin, the North China People's Government, the North China Central Bureau of the Chinese Communist Party, and all directly subordinate organs and schools of the North China Military Region are producing comfort bags day and night with unparalleled joy and enthusiasm to慰劳 the soldiers at the front. Minister Chao of the Education Department of the North China Government and his wife sent a pair of exquisite bags, "People's Warriors" and "Revolutionary Pioneers," which were sewn by Mrs. Chao, who is sixty years old, for six or seven days. She became like a young person, embroidering stitch by stitch. She said, "This is my small token of appreciation!" Deputy Minister Liu personally inscribed on the comfort bag: "Millions of liberated people are cheering for our victory everywhere, and millions of oppressed people are eagerly awaiting us to liberate them!" Deputy Minister Sun gave the soldiers a new camel hair hat woven by himself. Male comrades worked until late at night to make them by hand, and the female comrades made them even more beautiful. Comrade Qi Jun, who can draw, drew heroic figures of soldiers on the bags. At noon on the 24th, forty-two comfort bags of various colors were displayed in the office of the Education Department, filled with daily necessities such as towels, soap, toothbrushes, toothpaste, tobacco pouches, learning materials such as books, notebooks, pencils, and walnuts, candies, red dates, cigarettes, and dry tobacco. There were also treasured leather hats, pictures, pictures of children, and other gifts, and each bag contained a comfort letter. Just eleven service personnel sewed eight bags and included six comfort letters. Comrades from the Enterprise Department, in the midst of their busy work, studied what should be put inside the comfort bags and what significance they would have. Some, fearing that the soldiers at the front would be bored, even put playing cards in them. What was even more touching was that some comrades who were about to set off also strived to make the comfort bags before their departure. The Third Division of the North China Military Region Headquarters, after receiving the call from the higher authorities to launch a campaign to comfort the troops, the division party committee immediately held a meeting to study specific methods and decisions, and then convened a meeting of responsible cadres of the division's subordinate units for study. After the responsible cadres of each unit returned to their departments, they immediately convened branch and military personnel meetings to mobilize. When everyone heard the news, their enthusiasm was very high. They all believed that this was a good opportunity to connect the rear and the front. They all understood that the battle to liberate Peiping and Tientsin was the last battle to liberate the entire North China. After completing the liberation of the entire Northeast, the Northeast troops came into the pass without complaint and joined forces with the North China troops to fight for the liberation of the entire North China and China, and achieved today's victory. These achievements should first be attributed to the soldiers at the front. We who work in the rear should send them a little gift to express our care and慰问.
    At the mobilization meeting, many people reported their plans to comfort the troops on the spot. At the military personnel meeting in the division on the 14th, female comrades Zhang Yanfen and Wang Jianhua reported on the spot that in addition to completing a comfort bag for themselves, they would also make one for their lovers who were going to the front line to perform tasks. Female comrade Su Min took out her beloved pillowcase, which she had been reluctant to use and kept in her bag, and dedicated it to the soldiers at the front. Comrade Wang Mushui also took out his new foreign cloth shirt that was given to him when he joined the army. Comrade Lin Ping of the radio station district took out a new short-sleeved shirt that she had kept for a long time and was reluctant to use, and asked everyone if it was suitable for the soldiers to wear. After the meeting, everyone started working very actively. The female comrades in the repair shop worked until 3:00 AM to complete the bags and send them to the front as soon as possible. Many male comrades also made them by hand. The comrades in the engineering team had rough hands from climbing poles and setting lines, but they were also very patient in sewing, and many even embroidered words on them. Ding Shoufa, a communicator from the radio station district, bought a piece of cloth at the market and sewed it under the lamp until midnight. Comrades Song Yonglan and Zhang Fulin from the radio station ×× station went to the market to buy things and didn't even bother to eat.
    Because everyone was so active, the entire division had completed all the bags by the 19th of this month. Each unit sent 1,688 comfort bags to the division political department, exceeding the division's original plan of 668 bags. Moreover, each bag was full, with an average of four or five items per bag, and each was accompanied by a cordial comfort letter.

　　华北各领导机关
  　日夜赶制慰问袋
    把扑克牌装去
    让战士们解闷
    【本报消息】为庆祝平津解放，华北人民政府、中共华北中央局、华北军区各直属机关、学校，均以无比的欢欣与热情，日夜赶制慰问袋，慰劳前方将士。华北政府教育部晁部长夫妇送了“人民勇士”、“革命先锋”一对精致的袋子，是六十岁的晁夫人亲手缝了六七天才缝好的，她完全变得象年轻人一样，一针一线的刺绣，她说：“这总算我一点心意吧！”刘副部长亲在慰问袋上题着：“千百万已解放的人民，到处为我们的胜利欢呼，千百万被压迫的人民正渴望我们快去解放！”孙副部长以亲手织成的新驼绒帽送给战士，男同志都是赶至深夜在亲手制作，女同志做的更加漂亮，会画画的戚军同志在袋面上画了战士的雄姿，二十四号的中午，在教育部办公室内展览了四十二个各色各样的慰问袋，里面装了日用品毛巾、肥皂、牙刷、牙粉、烟袋，学习用品、书籍、日记本、铅笔及核桃、糖果、红枣、烟卷、旱烟，更有令人珍爱的皮帽、画片、孩子像片等种种礼物，并且袋子内都装有慰问信，仅仅十一个服务员就缝了八个袋子，装了六封慰问信。企业部的同志在工作百忙之中，边制慰问袋边研究这里面应放些什么东西，有些什么意义。有的怕前方的将士们闷，还把扑克牌装在里面，更使人感动的是，有的同志等着出发，也都争取在出发之前把慰问袋做好。华北军区司令部三处，自接到上级发动劳军的号召后，处党委会即召开了会议，研究了具体的办法及决定，又召集了处属各单位之负责干部进行了研究，各单位负责干部回部后，立即召开了支部、军人大会动员。当大家听到这个消息后，情绪非常高涨，都认为这是后方和前方联系的一个好机会；都了解了解放平、津之战，是解放全华北的最后一战，东北部队于完成全东北解放后，又不辞劳苦的打进关里来，和华北部队会师为解放全华北、全中国而战，并取得了今天的胜利。这些功劳，应首归前线将士，我们在后方工作的，为了表达对他们的关心和慰问，应送去一点点礼物。
    在进行动员的会议上，好多人当场报告了自己的劳军计划。在处部十四日的军人大会上，女同志张艳芬、王建华等当场报告了除自己完成一个慰问袋外，还要替自己上前线执行任务的爱人作一个。女同志苏敏在党的小组会上当场拿出了自己的一个包在包袱内舍不得用的心爱的枕头袋，献给前方将士；王木水同志把自己入伍时送给他的新洋布衬衣，也拿出来；电台区队林萍同志从包袱内拿出自己存放很久舍不得用的一件新短袖衬衣，问大家是否适合战士们穿。会后，大家很积极的作起来了。修理室的女同志们为了早日完成送上前线，她们一直工作到深夜下三点才睡，好多男同志也是亲自制：工程队的同志们都是爬杆子札线的粗手大脚，但他们也是很耐心的缝，有好多还绣上了字；电台区队的通信员丁守法在集上买了一块布回来，在灯下一直缝到半夜。电区队××台宋永蓝、张福林两同志到集上买东西，开了饭都顾不得吃了。
    由于大家这样积极，全处于本月十九日已全部完成，各单位送到处政慰问袋一六八八个，超过了全处的原计划六六八个，并且每袋都是满满的，平均每袋装物品四、五样，都附有亲切的慰问信。
