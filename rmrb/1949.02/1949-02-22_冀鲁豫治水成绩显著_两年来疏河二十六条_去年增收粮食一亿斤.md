[Hebei-Shandong-Henan Electric] The water management work in our Hebei-Shandong-Henan region has achieved great results in the past two years. According to incomplete statistics from 1947 and 1948, a total of 26 main and tributary rivers, including the Tuha River, Majia River, Zhao Wang River, Jin Xian River, Da Sha River, Po Long River, Xiao River, and Yong Shun Gou, have been dredged. Additionally, the South Canal's embankments have been reinforced and its risks have been addressed. A total of 646 ditches have been excavated. The earthwork completed in 1948 alone amounted to 5,875,895 cubic meters (excluding the earthwork done by 105,5096 civilian laborers who dredged waterways and planted wheat in the autumn, and the earthwork for reinforcing the South Canal embankments, which were not included in the statistics). In 1947, in the area north of the Yellow River, the area planted with wheat was expanded by 1,330,400 mu due to water drainage. Based on an average yield of 40 jin per mu (as the yield from flooded land was lower), the total increase in wheat production was 53,216,000 jin. In 1948, in the Hebei area, dredging rivers and excavating ditches reduced flooded land by 1,503,300 mu in the autumn. Based on the overall average yield of 110 jin of coarse grains per mu in the region last year, despite the poor harvest, the total increase in grain production was 166,636,300 jin. Our region has many rivers, with the Yellow River running through the central part, and rivers crisscrossing on both banks, connecting lakes and rivers. The rivers include the Yellow River, Wei River, Canal, Tuha River, Majia River, Zhao Wang River, Zhu Shui River, Wan Fu River, and other main tributaries, totaling 106. The lakes include Dongping, Nanwang, Nanyang, and Weishan Lakes. Regarding accumulated water, south of the Yellow River, only @shan and 17 other counties have 150 flooded areas, covering approximately 22,670 hectares. North of the Yellow River, only 8 counties including Zhuxian in the Sixth District have 54 flooded areas, covering approximately 9,440 hectares. The accumulated water in various places flows into the Bohai Sea via the Tuha and Majia Rivers north of the Yellow River, and into the sea via the Nanyang and other lakes, the South Canal, and the Huai River south of the Yellow River. During the Anti-Japanese War, the Japanese invaders dug blockading ditches and built碉堡 on river embankments, disrupting the river system and obstructing the smooth flow of accumulated water. For example, north of Zhangqiu on the Canal, blockading ditches were dug in the river, and the Yellow River and other embankments were damaged and fortifications were built. In 1947, the Kuomintang bandit army blocked the Yellow River at Huayuankou, causing a disastrous flood that devastated the lives and property of millions of residents in the riverbed. On July 26 of the same year, Chiang Kai-shek ordered the puppet Wang Sanzhu's troops to breach three openings, including the Huaxian Dam of the Wei River in Daokou Town, flooding 22 villages in Huaxian and Junxian counties, submerging 13,245 mu of nearly mature crops, and collapsing 264 civilian houses in Daokou Town. Last summer, the Nanyang Lake embankment was repeatedly organized by the masses to restore the embankment under the leadership of our democratic government, but it was obstructed by Chiang Kai-shek's bandit army, and it was not perfected, resulting in the breaching of the lake embankment during the rainy season. Our two years of river management projects have been carried out under such great difficulties. Although the achievements obtained have considerably overcome the disasters caused by the Japanese invaders and Chiang Kai-shek bandits, as well as natural disasters, they have not been able to completely eliminate the flood. When the rainy season comes every year, there are still many lands that are flooded, and the water management project still needs to be carried out vigorously.

　　冀鲁豫治水成绩显著
  　两年来疏河二十六条
    去年增收粮食一亿斤
    【冀鲁豫电】我冀鲁豫区的治水工作，两年来，得到很大成绩，根据一九四七年和一九四八年的不完全统计共疏了徒骇河、马颊河、赵王河、金线河、大沙河、泼龙河、硝河、永顺沟等主支流河二十六条，及南运河的复堤整险，共挖掘水沟六百四十六条，仅就一九四八年完成土方达五百八十七万五千八百九十五立方公尺（内秋季疏水种麦挖沟使用民工十万五千五百零九十六个未统计土方，南运河复堤，亦未统计土方）。一九四七年黄河北地区、疏水扩大种麦面积一百三十三万零四百亩，按每亩收获量平均四十市斤计（因水淹地收获量小些）共增收小麦五千三百二十一万六千斤。一九四八年河北地区浚河挖沟，秋季减少淹地一百五十万零三千三百亩，按去年全区歉收情况下，总平均收获是每亩杂粮一百十市斤计算，共增产粮食一万万六千六百三十六万三千斤。我区河流甚多，黄河横贯中部，两岸河流交叉纵横，湖河相通。河流计有：黄河、卫河、运河、徒骇河、马颊河、赵王河、洙水河、万福河等主支流一百零六条。湖泊计有：东平、南旺、南阳、微山等湖。积水洼黄河南仅＠山等十七县有一百五十个淹地，面积约二万二千六百七十顷，黄河北仅六分区筑先等八县有五十四个淹地，面积约九千四百四十顷。各地积水，黄河北岸经徒骇，马颊两河入渤海，黄河南岸均汇集南阳等湖，经南运河、淮河入海。抗日期间，日寇在河道堤岸挖封锁沟，修碉堡，打乱了河流体系，阻塞积水畅流。如运河自张秋以北在河中挖了封锁沟，黄河等堤被破坏修了工事。一九四七年国民党匪军在黄河花园口堵口，河床数百万居民生命财产惨遭淹没；同年七月二十六日蒋匪指使伪王三祝部在道口镇扒开卫河的滑县坝等三个口门，滑浚两县淹二十二个村，淹没一万三千二百四十五亩快要成熟的庄稼，并冲塌道口镇城关民房二百六十四间。去年夏南阳湖堤在我民主政府领导下，数次组织群众复堤，均遭蒋匪军阻挠未臻完善，致雨季湖堤决漫。我二年来的治河工程就是在如此重重困难下进行，所得成绩虽相当的克服了日寇蒋匪所造成的灾难以及天灾，尚未能根除水患，每年雨季到来时，仍然有不少土地被淹，治水工程尚待大力进行。
