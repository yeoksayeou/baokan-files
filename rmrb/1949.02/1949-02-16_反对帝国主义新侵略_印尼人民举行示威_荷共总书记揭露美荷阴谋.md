Hundreds of Indonesians shouted slogans such as "Long Live Freedom" and "Strive for the Liberation of Indonesia!" The demonstration took place during the arrival of former Indonesian President Sukarno on Bangka Island to meet with former Prime Minister Hatta and others to discuss participating in the Indonesian puppet "Federal Government."

TASS, The Hague, same day, reports: A group of Indonesian students refused to accept degrees from Dutch universities and decided to discontinue their studies in protest against the new aggression of the imperialists against Indonesia.

Groot pointed out that the Dutch government is a docile executor of the US order to invade Indonesia. He said that the Dutch government's reactionary policy is increasingly miring the Netherlands in the quagmire of the Indonesian guerrilla war. Groot declared that the Dutch people's anger is growing towards the Dutch government's policy of making the Netherlands an accomplice to US imperialist aggression.
