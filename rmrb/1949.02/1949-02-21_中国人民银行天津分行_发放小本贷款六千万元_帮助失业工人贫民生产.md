Xinhua News Agency, Tianjin, 18th: Since the liberation of Tianjin, the Tianjin Branch of the People's Bank of China has issued 60 million yuan (People's Currency, same below) in small loans to help unemployed workers and the poor engage in production. In order to ensure that this loan truly plays a role in organizing production, the bank dispatched a group of business personnel on the 25th of last month to cooperate with cadres from various districts in conducting trial loans. As of the 8th of this month, the trial loan work has been completed, and it has now entered the stage of universal lending. According to the bank's statistics, a total of 4,269,700 yuan was lent out during the trial loan period, benefiting 2,222 unemployed workers, poor citizens, handicraftsmen, and small merchants. Apart from a few who are engaged in small-scale handicraft production, the majority of those who received loans are making a living by trafficking. They purchase gauze, kerosene, cigarettes, sugar, pigments, tires, and other daily necessities from Tianjin and sell them in Beijing, Cangxian, Bozhen, Taierzhuang, and other places. Then, they bring back vegetables, meat, dried fruits, grain, and local rural products to sell in the city. This not only solves their livelihood difficulties but also enables the people of Tianjin to purchase vegetables, eggs, meat, and food at lower prices. Of course, this method of small loans itself, as well as organizing independent small production and trafficking in cities, can only be temporary and should not have a long-term development prospect. However, it can be used for emergency relief at present, and in the future, when conditions are met, these poor people should be gradually absorbed into the state-owned industrial and commercial systems.

According to the feedback from general borrowers, the loan term is too short, the procedures are cumbersome, and the loan interest rates in various districts are inconsistent. In order to correct these shortcomings, the Tianjin Branch has now decided: (1) The loan term will be appropriately extended in the future based on the actual needs of the borrowers. (2) In order to simplify the loan process, it is planned to organize a small loan review committee in each district. Borrowers only need to complete the procedures in the district and can directly withdraw the money from the bank. (3) Unify the interest rate. In the future, the monthly interest rate for industrial loans will be 5.1%, and the monthly interest rate for commercial loans will be 7.2%.

　　中国人民银行天津分行
  　发放小本贷款六千万元
    帮助失业工人贫民生产
    【新华社天津十八日电】天津市解放后，中国人民银行天津分行发放小本贷款六千万元（人民券，下同），帮助失业的工人、贫民进行生产。为使此项贷款真正发挥组织生产的作用，该行于上月二十五日曾派出一部业务人员配合各区干部，进行试贷工作。截至本月八日，试贷工作已告结束，现已进入普遍贷放。据该行统计，试贷中共贷出四百二十六万九千七百元，获得贷款之失业工人、贫苦市民、手工业者及小商人等达二千二百二十二人。获得贷款的人除少数是进行小手工业生产外，大多数是以贩运为生。他们从天津购买纱布、煤油、纸烟、糖、颜料、车胎及其他日用必需品。到北平、沧县、泊镇、台儿庄等地出售，然后带回蔬菜、肉类、干果、粮食及乡村土产等在市内推销。这不仅使他们的生活困难得到解决，且使津市人民能以低价购得蔬菜、鸡蛋、肉类及食粮。当然，这种小本贷款的办法本身以及在城市中组织独立的小生产和贩运，都只能是暂时的，不能有也不应有长久发展的前途，但在目前可以作救急之用，将来在条件具备时则应逐步把这些贫民吸收到国营的工商业系统中去。
    据一般借款者反映，此次贷款期限太短，手续较麻烦，各区贷款利率也参差不一。为了纠正这些缺点，天津分行现已决定：（一）贷款期限，今后将根据借款者的实际需要而适当延长。（二）为求贷款简便。计划在各区组织小本贷款审查委员会，贷款者只需在区里办好手续，便可直接到银行取款。（三）统一利率，今后工业贷款月息一律五分一厘，商业贷款月息一律七分二厘。
