　　Rectification Combined with Production
  　Anyang Village Begins Delivering Manure
    [Taihang News] Starting on the 2nd of last month, Anyang Village in the 7th District of Pingshun, began rectifying the Party by addressing the remaining issues from the land reform and paying attention to leadership in production, achieving great results: Many people have already begun delivering manure, and the People's Congress is leading the entire village in rectifying mutual aid and carrying out specific preparations for spring plowing.
    After inspecting and concluding the land reform, resolving remaining issues, and implementing production education, the masses' enthusiasm for production was further improved. In particular, after the propaganda of the Party rectification policy and the initial ideological mobilization of the branch, Party members and cadres were relieved of their concerns about Party rectification, and their work enthusiasm was improved. Therefore, in the process of Party rectification, they rectified the Party while leading production work. Cui Fubao, a labor hero in the village, personally took the lead in organizing winter production and took time to deliver manure to the fields, influencing and promoting the whole village. Niu Denian and Li Jinfu have already delivered all the manure they had. Every morning, most of the village's labor force is delivering manure, engaging in firewood collection and other production activities during the day, and holding meetings at night to help with Party rectification. In total, during the period of Party rectification, the entire village delivered 27,300 loads of manure to the fields, collected 52,200 jin of firewood, and earned 829,000 yuan in foreign currency through transportation and small business, and the oil mill earned 110 oil cakes and more than 2 shi and 7 dou of rice. Currently, the People's Congress of the village is leading the entire village in rectifying mutual aid and combining it with the formulation of plans, actively carrying out specific preparations for spring plowing.
