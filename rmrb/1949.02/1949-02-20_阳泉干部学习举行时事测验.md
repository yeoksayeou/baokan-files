Learning Dynamics

　　Yangquan City cadres, after deciding on January 24th to conduct a week of current affairs study before the Lunar New Year, immediately used "Carry the revolution through to the end" and Chairman Mao's statement on the current situation on January 14th as the learning content. A current affairs quiz was held on January 27th, with a total of 82 people participating. The test results showed that 15 people scored above 80, 30 people scored above 60, and 37 people failed. The results of this quiz were not good. For example, everyone said that Chiang Kai-shek's request for peace talks was just a conspiracy, but they could not explain what the conspiracy was. Similarly, regarding questions such as: What was the strategic policy adopted by the People's Liberation Army in the first year? What fundamental changes occurred in the second year and the first half of the third year? Many people answered with extremely general statements such as: the first year was guerrilla warfare and defensive warfare, the second year was mobile warfare and active warfare, and the first half of the third year was a full-scale offensive, etc. From this quiz, it can be seen that many comrades, due to their low theoretical and cultural level, cannot deeply understand the spirit of the documents. In addition to announcing the test scores, a collective explanation was given to correct erroneous views and improve understanding. Some comrades were also encouraged to enhance their confidence in learning.

　　阳泉干部学习举行时事测验
    阳泉市干部学习在一月二十四日，决定旧历年前进行一星期的时事学习后，随即以“将革命进行到底”与一月十四日毛主席对时局的声明作为学习内容，并于一月二十七日，举行了一次时事测验，共八十二人参加，测验结果八十分以上的十五名，六十分以上的三十名，不及格的三十七名。这次测验的成绩并不好，如对蒋介石要求和谈问题大家都说这只是阴谋，说不出其阴谋所在，又如同：人民解放军第一年所采取的战略方针是什么？第二年第三年前半年发生了什么根本变化？很多人都答说：第一年是游击战、防御战，第二年是运动战主动战，第三年头半年是全面进攻战等等极为笼统的回答。从这次测验中，可看出许多同志由于理论文化水平低，不能深刻领会文件精神。除公布测验的分数外，并作了一次集体解答，纠正错误看法，提高认识，并对部分同志加以鼓励，增强其对学习的信心。
