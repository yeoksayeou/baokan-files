Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 16th. Reports from various sources: Under the pressure of the American expansionist figure Cochran (formerly translated as Cochrane), the Dutch Minister for Overseas Colonies, Jonkheer van Maarseveen, submitted his resignation on the evening of the 11th. He is a representative of the "hard-line" faction within the Dutch Catholic Party, advocating for ensuring Dutch monopoly over Indonesia and expressing dissatisfaction with the further American plunder of Dutch interests in Indonesia. His position will be taken by former Interior Minister Marjnen, a "moderate" figure who advocates compromise with the United States. The division within the Dutch cabinet exists not only between the Catholic Party and the Socialist Party but also within the Catholic Party itself. During the recent uproar in the Dutch Parliament, the Catholic Foreign Minister Stikker advised the "hard-line" members, led by Romme, the parliamentary leader of the party, to "look at the issue more realistically." Since Cochran's arrival in The Hague, the division within the Catholic Party has intensified. During the intense two-day debate on the Indonesian issue at the Dutch cabinet meetings on the 10th and 11th, the majority of Catholic ministers, led by Deputy Prime Minister Schaik and Interior Minister Marjnen, joined the "moderate" camp.

　　在美帝压力下
  　荷海外殖民部长辞职
    【新华社陕北十六日电】各方报导：在美国扩张主义分子柯契伦（前译为柯克伦）的压力下，荷海外殖民部长沙逊已于十一日晚提出辞呈，他是荷兰天主教党中的“强硬”派代表，主张确保荷兰对印尼的独占，并对美国进一步掠夺荷兰在印尼的利益表示不满。他的位置将由主张对美妥协的“温和”派分子原内政部长马里文接替。荷兰内阁两派的分歧，不仅发生在天主教党与社会党之间，亦发生在天主教党内部。在日前荷兰国会的吵嚷中，天主教党的荷外长斯蒂克即劝告以该党议会党团领袖罗姆为首的“强硬”分子，“对问题看得现实一些”。柯契伦抵海牙后，天主教党的分化日益加剧。在十日与十一日，荷兰内阁会议对印尼问题展开两天的激烈辩论中，以副总理谢克与内政部长马里文为首的大部分天主教党部长，投入了“温和”派阵营。
