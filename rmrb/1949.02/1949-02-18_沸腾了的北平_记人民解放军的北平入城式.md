Boiling Beiping
    -- A Record of the People's Liberation Army's Entry Ceremony into Beiping
    Liu Baiyu
    On February 3rd, the People's Liberation Army held the entry ceremony for the liberation of Beiping. Armored troops, artillery, tank units, cavalry, and infantry entered the city from Yongdingmen in the south and Xizhimen in the northwest. After converging, they headed south, turned from West Chang'an Avenue to Hepingmen, and then west, exiting from Guang'anmen. This mighty procession, from ten in the morning to four in the afternoon, saw its front already exiting Hepingmen while the rear was still surging towards Yongdingmen.
    
    That day, from early morning, the people flocked to Tiananmen Square in groups and teams. At 9:30, General Lin Biao, General Luo Ronghuan, General Nie Rongzhen, and General Ye Jianying appeared on the Qianmen arrow tower. At this time, the people's ranks on Qianmen Square were like an ocean, with various colors and fluttering flags like churning sea waves. People held aloft the giant portraits of their beloved leader Chairman Mao and Commander-in-Chief Zhu. Workers, students, office workers, professors, all kinds of people came. People squeezed forward, squeezed forward. A festively decorated locomotive entered the East Railway Station, carrying several thousand workers from the Pinghan Railway, who had rushed in from the distant Changxindian. Railway employees from Fengtai also poured into the welcoming ranks. Workers from nine factories, including the automobile factory and the machinery factory, removed the cap badges with the Kuomintang emblem from their hats. A Yenching University student said, "I got up at three-thirty before dawn."
    
    At ten o'clock, four flares rose into the sky, and the solemn and grand entry ceremony began. Far away from the north, from the front of Qianmen, a dark mass of people came forward to greet them, with a welcoming banner fluttering in the wind at the front; from the south, the leading armored vehicle of the People's Army, waving a red command flag, drove towards the welcoming crowd, followed by four red Victory trucks, with portraits of Chairman Mao and Commander-in-Chief Zhu hanging high, fully loaded with bands, brass instruments gleaming, playing majestic marches. The armored vehicle units followed in a line. In the Zhushikou area, the troops met the welcoming ranks. The welcoming ranks were on the left, and the troops were on the right, with thunderous cheers. Waving! Shouting! Many people shed tears of excitement. Glory! Only the people's army can receive such glory. The crowd surged forward, shouting "Long live!" They ran into the ranks of the People's Liberation Army, and the procession became difficult to move forward. The welcoming masses wrote on the armored vehicles: "You've come, we are greatly happy!" "How bright!" "Comrades! Keep up the good work! Completely eliminate the Kuomintang reactionaries!"--The procession continued to move forward to Tiananmen Square.
    
    At twelve o'clock, a cheer arose from the crowd, and the people's heroic artillery appeared. Green Dodge trucks towed anti-tank guns, anti-aircraft guns, chemical mortars, American-made 155mm howitzers, Japanese-made 155mm howitzers, and huge cannons, one after another. Among them were several American-equipped heavy artillery regiments captured from western Liaoning and Shenyang. Look! How much the people love their weapons: On top of a huge howitzer, a child from Beiping rode, proudly holding up the flag in his hand and smiling as he passed. Several other howitzers were inscribed with: "Aim at Chiang Kai-shek!" "Send one to each of the Four Big Families!" On a huge 100mm cannon, a heroic gunner with a medal on his chest hugged a postal worker in green. Following behind, on another cannon stood five or six female students. There was also a businessman standing on the gun mount, waving and shouting "Long live the People's Liberation Army!" On the arrow tower, General Lin Biao, inspecting this heroic procession, watched every gun carriage with solemnity and kindness, watching the people's jubilation. Below the arrow tower, the loudspeaker truck of the United Celebration Association led the singing of "Our troops are here!" "Our troops are here!" The camera clicked and whirred. Countless gun carriages sped past the cheering people. Gongs and drums shook the sky on both sides, and people danced the Yangko dance. Tsinghua University was on the left, and Yenching University was on the right. They sang and danced. Some were dressed up as Chiang Kai-shek, Soong Tzu-wen, Kung Hsiang-hsi, and Soong Mei-ling, displaying various embarrassing and ugly postures in the face of the powerful force of the People's Army. This was a true reflection of history, and the people's love and hatred were clearly manifested here.
    
    At one-ten, suddenly someone discovered smoke rising next to the Qianmen archway. Someone shouted, "Our tanks are here!" A rumble of tanks came, and the first tank came closer and closer. A young student waved both hands, standing on the tank's turret, frantically shouting "Long live!" "Long live!" Every tank flew a red flag. A burst of cheers erupted from the crowd, some so happy that tears flowed, forgetting to wipe them away. Tank crews wearing brimless leather caps showed their upper bodies from the tank towers, saluting the people, gunners, smiling, and saluting. Behind the tank units were the motorized guard troops, with green steel helmets and gleaming bayonets on the trucks. An old man with white hair watched happily, taking a breath and said, "I can finally breathe a sigh of relief!" Another said, "With such a powerful armed force, no reactionaries will be allowed to bully us again."
    
    At this time, a song "The East is Red, the sun rises..." resounded through the sky. From afar, it seemed like a wave of wheat undulating. Closer, it turned out to be the people's cavalry wearing leather hats arriving. People shouted, applauded, and threw colorful paper flags into the sky. The clatter of horses' hooves stepped on the asphalt road, so orderly and majestic. The cavalry's sabers gleamed with cold light. Behind the cavalry were the heroic infantry. At three o'clock, when the military band leading the way appeared, the people's jubilation reached its peak. One heroic unit entered the city from Yongdingmen, and the other entered from Xizhimen. One was called the "storm-like army" by the enemy, and the other was the "Tashan Heroic Unit." In the winter of 1946, in that era when the sky seemed dark, they fought side by side in Siping and Linjiang under Changbai Mountain. These two heroic units, from hardship to victory, received the love and passionate affection of the people here. This is the glory of the People's Liberation Army and the pride of the Chinese people. The soldiers advanced under the gaze of millions of loving eyes. A combat hero with six medals on his chest was warmly surrounded and pulled by the people. A female student ran up to touch the glorious Mao Zedong Medal. At this time, the welcoming people had stood for a whole day, forgetting the cold, forgetting the hunger, and reluctantly parting with these heroes. They merged with the marching procession, singing "I will always follow you forward," and proudly passed through Dongjiaomin Lane, which had always been a forbidden area for imperialists.
    
    Towards five o'clock in the afternoon, the setting sun shone into Guang'anmen, where countless people cheered and saw off the steel mechanical troops in front of the tall city gate. On the battle vehicles and tanks that had been driving for a whole day, countless small red flags fluttered, and the soldiers held bouquets of flowers presented to them by the people. Although it was twilight, the entire Beiping was still filled with joyful songs. Beiping was truly boiling.

　　沸腾了的北平
    ——记人民解放军的北平入城式
    刘白羽
    二月三日，人民解放军举行了解放北平的入城仪式。装甲都队、炮兵、坦克部队、骑兵、步兵，一路从南面永定门入城，另一路由西北面西直门入城，会合之后向南走，由西长安街转和平门，向西，出广安门，这浩浩荡荡的行列，从上午十点到下午四点钟，前头已经出了和平门，后头还在向永定门拥进。
    这天，从早晨起，人民就一群群一队队地，向前门广场拥去。九时半，林彪将军、罗荣桓将军、聂荣臻将军、叶剑英将军，出现在前门箭楼上。这时候，前门广场上，人民的行列象海洋，各色各样，红的白的，猎猎飘动的旗帜，就象翻腾的海浪。人们高举着自己热爱的领袖毛主席和朱总司令的巨像。工人、学生、职员、教授，各式各样的人都来了。人们向前挤，向前挤。结彩的火车头开进了东车站，载着好几千平汉路工人，从远远的长辛店赶得来。丰台的铁路员工也拥进了欢迎的行列，汽车厂、机械厂等等九个工厂的工人，摘去了帽子上带有国民党党徽的帽花。一个燕京同学说：“我三点半天没亮就起来了。”
    十时，四颗照明弹升上了天空，庄严隆重的入城式开始了。远远的从北面，从前门那边，黑压压地一片人迎上前来，前面一面欢迎大旗迎风飘舞；从南面，人民军队的头一辆带队的装甲车，摇着一面红色指挥旗，朝着欢迎的人群开过来，随后是高悬毛主席、朱总司令肖像的四辆红色胜利卡车，满载着乐队，铜管乐器金光闪闪，吹奏着雄壮的进行曲。装甲车部队一条线似的接在后面。在珠市口一带，部队与欢迎的行列相遇了，欢迎的行列在左面，部队在右面，欢呼雷动。招手呀！呼喊呀！多少人激动的流下了眼泪。光荣呀！只有人民的军队才能得到这样的光荣。人群拥上来了，高呼着“万岁！”他们跑进了解放军行列里面，队伍都不好向前走了。欢迎的群众在装甲车上写：“你们来了，我们大大快乐！”“真光明啊！”“同志们！加油呀！彻底消灭国民党反动派呀！”——队伍陆续向前门广场前进。
    十二时，人群里起了一片欢呼声，人民的英雄炮兵出现了，绿色道奇卡车牵引着战防炮、高射炮、化学迫击炮、美式十五生的榴弹炮、日式十五生的榴张炮、巨大的加农炮，一辆接着一辆。这里面有从辽西，从沈阳缴获的几个美国装备的重炮团，看啊！人民是多么喜爱自己的武器：一门巨大的榴弹炮上面，骑着一个北平的小孩子，他骄傲地高举着手里的旗子笑着过去了。另外几门榴弹炮被人们写上了：“瞄准蒋介石呀！”“送给四大家族每人一颗呀！”十生的巨型加农炮上，一个胸前挂了奖章的英雄炮手，和一个穿绿衣服的邮政工人抱在一起。随后驶过的另一门大炮上站着五、六个女学生。还有一个商人站在炮座上挥手高呼“解放军万岁！”箭楼上，检阅这一英雄行列的林彪将军，庄严而亲切地注视着每一辆炮车，注视着人民的狂欢。箭楼下，庆祝解放联合会的扩音车，领导着唱起“我们的队伍来了！”“我们的队伍来了！”开麦拉轧轧地响。数也数不尽的炮车，从欢呼的人们身边奔驰过去，两旁锣鼓喧天，人们扭起秧歌舞来，左面是清华，右面是燕京。他们唱呀，舞呀。有的化装做蒋介石、宋子文、孔祥熙、宋美龄，在人民部队强大的威力面前，显出各种狼狈的丑态，这是历史的真实反映，人民的爱与憎在这里明白地显现出来。
    一时十分，突然谁发现了前门牌楼旁边冒起了青烟。喊了声“我们的坦克来了！”一阵坦克轰隆隆的声音传了过来，第一辆坦克从远而近，一个青年学生挥着两只手，站在坦克的炮塔上，狂热地喊“万岁！”“万岁！”每个坦克上飘着一面红旗。人群里激起一片欢呼，有的欢喜得流出泪，也忘了擦了。戴着无沿皮帽子的坦克手，从坦克塔里露出上身，向人民炮手、微笑、敬礼。坦克部队后面是摩托化警卫都队，卡车上一色绿的钢盔，雪亮的剌刀。一位白发苍苍的老人，看得高兴，笑着喘了口气说：“这口气可喘过来了！”另外一位说：“我们老百姓有了这样强大的武装，任何反动派也不许他再欺负我们了。”
    这时，一片“东方红，太阳升，………”歌声响彻天祭。远远好象一片麦浪波动，近来一看原来是戴着皮帽子的人民骑兵来到了。人们叫呀，鼓掌呀，把五彩的纸旗都抛上天空。的哒的哒的马蹄踏着柏油马路，那样整齐、雄壮、骑兵们手上的马刀闪着寒光。骑兵后面就是英雄的步兵。三时，作为前导的军乐队一出现。人民的欢腾达到了顶点的时侯了。英雄的部队一支从永定门进城，一支从西直门进城，一个是被敌人称作“暴风雨式的军队”，一个“塔山英雄部队”、在一九四六年冬季，那天空似乎是黑暗的时代，他们在长白山下四保临江，并肩作战。这两支英雄部队从艰难到胜利，在这里得到了人民的热爱、狂爱，这是解放军的光荣，也是中国人民的夸耀。战士们在千万只热爱的眼光下前进。一个胸前挂着六个奖章的战斗英雄，被人们热烈地围着、拉着。一个女学生跑上去摸摸那个光荣的毛泽东奖章。这时，欢迎的人们已经站了整整一天，忘记了寒冷，忘记了饥饿，依恋地舍不得这些英雄，他们与行进的队伍汇合起来，高唱“我永远跟着你前进”，昂然通过一向为帝国主义禁地的东交民巷。
    将近下午五时的时候，夕阳照进了广安门，在高大的城门前有无数人群欢送钢铁机械部队。在驶行一整日的战车上、坦克上，飘闪着无数小红旗，战士们手上还捧着人民献给他们的一束束鲜花，这时虽然暮色苍茫，可是整个北平还到处充满愉快的歌声。北平是真正沸腾了。
