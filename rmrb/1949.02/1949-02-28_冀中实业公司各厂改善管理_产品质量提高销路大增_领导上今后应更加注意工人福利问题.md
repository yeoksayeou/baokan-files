　　Jizhong Industrial Company Factories Improve Management
  　Product Quality Increases, Sales Greatly Increase
    Leaders Should Pay More Attention to Worker Welfare Issues in the Future

　　[Our Newspaper News] The dyeing and rolling, flour, chemical, and match factories led by the Jizhong Industrial Company, following the end of the winter production increase competition movement, have entered a new stage of improving quality, improving management, and opening up sales channels in January's production movement. By the end of January, great achievements had been made. In terms of quality, the match factory increased by an average of 4 percent, the chemical factory's vulcanized blue increased by 30 percent, and the waste products and rework of the Jianhua dyeing and rolling factory, Julong, and Hongye Iron Factory were also reduced.

　　The factories have also made great improvements in business operations. The purchase of saltpeter in January exceeded the original procurement plan by two times, and supported the development of mass sideline industries. Purchases of oxhide, lead sheets, carbolic acid, etc., all exceeded the plan. In terms of sales, 1,500 barrels of sodium sulfide and 1,300 mats of matches were sold in January, appropriately grasping the rise and fall of prices and directly supplying producers in various regions in a planned manner. In the great production movement, due to the improvement of product quality and smooth sales, demand already exceeded supply. The achievement of these results is mainly due to the active efforts of the factory workers and the implementation of the principle of democratic management by the leadership. For example, the match factory workers proposed that the standards set by the factory for estimates were low, that good machines and substandard machines should have different requirements, and that piecework for large saws should be changed to piecework by the square foot. The adoption of these suggestions further improved the production enthusiasm of the workers.

　　When the movement came to an end, the award summary and selection of models were immediately carried out based on labor attitude and technical ability, which further increased the workers' production enthusiasm. Everyone worked hard to study technology, improve tools, save raw materials, and improve quality and output. In the past, the large boiler in the chemical factory would break down once every ten or eight days, and at most had never burned for more than fifteen days, and each repair would cost 70 to 80 million Border Region currency. Now, after workers' research, the bottom of the boiler has been changed to double suspension (brick-built) and careful mastery of the heat, and it has not broken down for more than a month from December to now. Vulcanized alkali saves half of the raw materials and coal per day in the same quantity of products, greatly reducing costs. After research and improvement of the rotary shaft, the quality of finished products has also been greatly improved.

　　The open establishment of the Party branches and the New Democratic Youth League in various factories has further improved the political consciousness of Party members and workers. Party members and Youth League members played a backbone role in promoting the movement. After the separation of the Julong Iron Factory's branch, due to the active production of Party members, driving the workers, at the meeting, nine people including Wang Baixiang requested to join the Party. Party members in the match factory played a vanguard role in the movement. Party members Shen Qingliang, Zhao Zhanfang, Wang Ying (female), etc., after criticism and self-criticism, made self-examinations in front of the workers, proposing to work hard to make up for past losses, so the prestige of Party members among the workers was further enhanced. In the award summary of the chemical factory, Youth League members accounted for 85 percent of the total number of winners in the factory. Great achievements have been made in the movement, but there are still several shortcomings: (1) First of all, some factories have neglected worker welfare, and some practical problems of workers and their families have not been well resolved. In particular, in the chemical factory, due to poor insurance equipment, one person died from injury. State-owned enterprises are so lax and indifferent to worker welfare, and should be strictly checked and corrected. (2) The leadership failed to earnestly grasp that increasing production should be based on "improving tools" and "improving technology," but simply encouraged "enhancing labor intensity" and "extending working hours." Although extending working hours is the workers' spontaneous production enthusiasm, the leadership should pay close attention to the workers' health. Due to the development of the movement, it has affected workers' learning, and it should also be properly resolved. (3) The leadership of some factories has been tight at the beginning and loose at the end, and cannot gradually improve. The output of the leather factory exceeded the most in January, and then decreased again. The leadership of the match factory was loose and tight from time to time, and because the goods sold quickly, it neglected the improvement in quality. (4) Neglecting cost accounting and scientific management. When prices fluctuate, the engineering department does not even know the cost of various products, so it is impossible to use cost to explain the merits of the movement. In business operations, some units have a vague understanding of profiteers and speculators, and have suffered great losses.

### 冀中实业公司各厂改善管理　产品质量提高销路大增  领导上今后应更加注意工人福利问题

　　冀中实业公司各厂改善管理
  　产品质量提高销路大增
    领导上今后应更加注意工人福利问题
    【本报讯】冀中实业公司领导的染轧、面粉、化学、火柴等工厂，接着冬季增产竞赛运动结束以后，一月份生产运动已进入提高质量，改善经营，打开销路的新阶段。截至一月底，已获得很大成绩。在质量上，火柴厂平均提高了百分之四，化学厂的硫化青提高了百分之三十，建华染轧厂、聚隆和宏业铁工厂的废品、翻工也都减少了。
    各厂在业务经营上也有很大改进。皮硝一月份超过原采购计划两倍，并扶植了群众副业的发展。牛皮、铅板、石炭酸等都超过计划。在销售上，一月份销出臭硷一千五百桶，火柴一千三百席，适当掌握了价格的涨落，与有计划的供给各地直接生产者。在大生产运动中，由于产品质量提高、销路畅通，已经供不应求。这些成绩的获得，主要由于各厂职工的积极努力，领导上贯彻了民主管理的原则。如火柴厂工人提出厂内对估计的规定标准低，好机器和次机器应有不同要求，大锯按料计工应改为按方尺计工，这意见的被采纳，更提高了职工的生产情绪。
    运动告一段落时，马上根据劳动态度、技术能力，抓紧评奖总结，选拔模范，就更加提高了工人的生产热忱，大家都努力的研究技术，改良工具，节省原料，提高质量和产量。化学厂过去大锅炉十天八天就烧坏一次，最多没烧过十五天，每修理一次须开支边币七、八千万。现在经过工人的研究，锅底改为双悬（砖砌的）和细心的掌握火候，从十二月到现在，一月多还没坏过。硫化硷在同等产品的数量上，每天节省了一半原料和煤，大大减低了成本。旋轴经过研究改进后，成品质量上也大为提高。
    各厂党的支部公开和建立新民主主义青年团后，更加提高了党员和职工的政治觉悟。党员和青年团员在运动中起了骨干推动作用。聚隆铁工厂的支部分开后，由于党员的积极生产，带动职工，在会议上就有王柏祥等九个人要求入党。火柴厂的党员，在运动中起着先锋作用。党员沈庆良、赵占芳、王英（女）等，经过批评与自我批评后，在工人面前作了自我检讨，提出努力工作，弥补过去的损失，因此，党员在工人中的威信更加提高。化学厂在评奖总结中，该厂青年团员占了得奖总人数百分之八十五。在运动中获得了很大成绩，但是还有几个缺点：（一）首先有些厂忽视工人福利，工人和工人家属也有些实际问题，没有很好解决。特别是化学厂因保险设备不好，致有一人因伤死亡。国营企业对工人福利，竟如此放松和漠视，应严格检查纠正。（二）领导上未能认真的掌握增加产量应从“改善工具”和“提高技术”为前提，而是单纯的鼓励“增强劳动强度”与“延长工作时间”，虽然延长工时是工人自发的生产热忱，但领导上应很好注意到工人的健康。由于运动的开展影响工人的学习，也应适当解决。（三）有的厂领导上前紧后松，不能逐步提高。皮革厂一月份产量超过最多，后又降低下去。火柴厂领导上时松时紧，更由于货销的快，就忽视了质量上的提高。（四）忽视成本核算与科学管理。在物价波动时，工程科竟并不清各种产品的成本，这就不能拿成本来说明运动成绩的好坏。在经营中有的单位，对奸商投机倒把认识模糊，而吃了很大的亏。
