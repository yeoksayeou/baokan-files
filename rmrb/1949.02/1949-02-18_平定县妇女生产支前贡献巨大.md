　　Pingding County Women
  　Make Great Contributions to Production and Support for the Front
    [Report from Our Newspaper] Pingding women have made great achievements in supporting the front lines in the past year. Women have improved their political and economic status through production. Of the 137,500 women in the county, more than 64,700 have participated in labor. They have made great achievements in agricultural and sideline production, taking on the important task of supporting the rear and supporting the front in place of men. During the spring disaster and summer drought last year, women participated in weeding, digging grass, transportation and other work, overcoming difficulties and overcoming the disaster with their greatest efforts. According to statistics from ten districts: 9,817 women participated in digging and plowing with human power, digging a total of 18,032 mu, accounting for more than 9.1% of the total land in the ten districts. In sideline production: In Cheng Guan District, from last winter to this spring, 493 women went to Yangquan for transportation or other work, earning a profit of 537,500 JBC. 366 women in Liudao Street engaged in transportation, earning 1,200,540 yuan in one month, which could buy ten dan and six dou of millet. For example, in the Thirteen District, Jing Shengwen, a villager of Sanjiao Village, earned 60% of his family's income from his own production. In Cheng Guan District, Jia Guiying and other more than ten people could push more than 200 jin of small carts at most. In terms of weaving, although it has not been fully developed, individual villages have still achieved results. For example, in Xia Xuzhuang, which has just over 250 people, there are 11 weaving groups composed of 57 women, who sold a total of 330.5 zhang of cloth. After deducting the capital, they still had 169 jin of cotton, worth 200,300 yuan at the current price, which could buy 33 dan and 8 dou of grain (large market dou). This is the statistic before May last year. In terms of supporting the front lines, according to statistics from three villages in four districts: 4,137 women delivered public grain, delivering a total of 187,420 jin of public grain, accounting for more than 9.8% of the public grain in the four districts. Most of the county's more than 55,000 dan of public grain was milled by women. Under the slogan of supporting the war called by the higher authorities, the county made 71,000 pairs of military shoes. In addition, women in ten districts also helped migrant workers and militiamen make 624 pieces of clothing and 580 pairs of socks. Great progress has also been made in political participation: the general public's old view of women simply managing housework has been broken. For example, among the 36 representatives of the Dongkai People's Congress, there are 15 women.

　　平定县妇女
  　生产支前贡献巨大
    【本报讯】平定妇女一年来在支援前线工作上，有很大成绩。妇女在生产中提高了政治经济地位。全县十三万七千五百余妇女中，参加劳动的有六万四千七百余人。在农业与副业生产上有很大成就，代替男人负担起后方生产、支援前线的重大任务。去年春灾夏旱时，妇女参加了锄苗、挖草、运输等工作，以最大的努力克服了困难，渡过灾荒。据十个区统计：参加刨地和用人拉犁的妇女，有九千八百十七人，共刨地一万八千零三十二亩，占十个区土地总数百分之九点一强。副业生产上：城关区妇女，从去年冬至今年春，跑阳泉走运输或做其他活的，有四百九十三人，赚得利五十三万七千五百元冀钞。六道街三百六十六个妇女搞运输，一个月内赚一百二十万零五千四百元，能买小米十石六斗。如十三区三郊村荆胜文自己生产的收入占全家收入的百分之六十，城关区贾桂英等十余人，推小车最多的能推二百多斤。在纺织方面，虽没有全面性的开展起来，但个别村庄还是有成绩的。如不过二百五十人口的下许庄，就有五十七个妇女组成的十一个纺织组，共卖出布三百三十丈五尺，除本钱外还把棉花一百六十九斤，合时价二十万零三千元，能买粮三十三石八斗（大市斗），这是去年五月前统计。支援前线工作，据四个区三个村统计：妇女送公粮的有四千一百三十七人，共送公粮十八万七千四百二十斤，占四个区公粮的百分之九点八强。全县五万五千多石公粮，绝大部分是妇女碾的。在上级号召支援战争的口号下，全县做了七万一千双军鞋，另有十个区妇女，还帮助民工民兵做衣服六百二十四件，袜子五百八十双。参政工作上也有很大进步：打破了一般人对妇女单纯管理家务的旧观点。如东开人民代表会的三十六个代表中，就有妇女十五名。
