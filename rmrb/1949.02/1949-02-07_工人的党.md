　　The Workers' Party
　　Kailuan Well Machinery Worker, Hong Yi
　　"The Communist Party is indeed our workers' party!" This is a very common and popular saying among the workers. Indeed, this sentence is by no means empty talk, but is proven by facts.
　　At the Linxi workers' symposium on New Year's Day, the workers put forward several suggestions. The first was to solve the immediate livelihood problems, the second was to avoid the exploitation of workers' coal tickets by coal dealers, and to establish a workers' coal sales cooperative. The third was in terms of learning. In order to enhance the miners' knowledge and understanding of the revolutionary cause, and to improve technical efficiency, workers' literacy classes were also organized. With the assistance of the staff and workers' preparatory committee, the above-mentioned opinions concerning the vital interests of the working class were quickly implemented within three or four days. The coal sales cooperative was established, transporting coal from the mining bureau to the countryside or other places, in exchange for some grain and necessities to maintain the lives of the workers. The cooperative has begun serving staff, workers, and farmers since the 6th. The literacy school, which is being actively prepared, is also about to officially open. The workers' emotions are very enthusiastic and excited. Literacy classes have been established within the machinery and electricity departments for their own work. In terms of cultural entertainment, a singers' team of trainees has also been established.
　　These vast masses of insulted and injured working people have stood up under the leadership of the Communist Party. In the past, they were slaves under the oppression of the Kuomintang reactionaries, but now the working people are the masters of the new society.

    开滦井机工人  弘毅
    “共产党的确是我们工人的党！”这是一句在工友口中很普通流行的话，真的，这句话决不是空谈，而是有事实证明的。
    元旦那天林西工友座谈会上，工人们提出了几个意见，第一是解决眼前生活问题，第二为避免工人煤票受煤贩子的剥削，成立了工友售煤合作社，第三是在学习方面的，为了增进矿工的知识和对革命事业的认识，为了提高技术的效能，又组织工人补习班，以上几种关于工人阶级切身利益的意见，在职工筹委会的协助下，这三四天之内，就很快的成立了售煤合作社，把矿务局的煤由合作社运往乡间或其它各地，换取一部分粮食和必需品，维持工友的生活，合作社已由六日开始为职工、农民服务了。正在积极筹备的补习学校，也就要正式开学了。工人的情绪都非常热烈兴奋。机务处、电务处在自己工作的部分内，都成立了补习班。文化娱乐方面还成立了练习生的歌咏队。
    这广大的被侮辱与损害的劳苦群众们，在共产党的领导下站起来了，过去在国民党反动派的压榨下是奴隶，现在劳动的人民就是新社会的主人。
