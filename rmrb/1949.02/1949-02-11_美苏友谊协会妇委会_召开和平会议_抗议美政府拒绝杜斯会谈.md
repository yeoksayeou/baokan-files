Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, February 9th: According to TASS, New York, February 6th: The Women's Committee of the National Council of American-Soviet Friendship recently held a peace conference attended by 200 people. Kimball, Vice Chairman of the committee and a leader of the Progressive Party's women's movement, urged American women to intensify their struggle for peace. The conference passed a telegram to Truman protesting the United States' rejection of repeated Soviet proposals to discuss unresolved international issues, particularly existing US-Soviet differences. The telegram stated: We formally oppose the conclusion of the "North Atlantic Treaty," and we insist on the cancellation of this plan because it endangers the interests of the American nation and world peace. We pledge to redouble our efforts to win the support of all peace-loving Americans, to oppose the "Cold War," and to achieve world and lasting peace through understanding and cooperation with the Soviet Union.
