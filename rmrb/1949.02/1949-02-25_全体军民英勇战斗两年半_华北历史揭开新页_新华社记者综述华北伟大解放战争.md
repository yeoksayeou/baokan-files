Xinhua News Agency, North China, February 23rd: This reporter's overview of the great War of Liberation in North China over two years and seven months states (excluding Shandong and western Shanxi): After the liberation of Tianjin and Peiping (Beijing), North China has been basically completely liberated. Now the Kuomintang bandit troops are only entrenched in a few isolated cities such as Taiyuan, Datong, Xinxiang, and Anyang. These few are just extremely tiny blemishes on the beautiful map of North China, and will soon be swept away by the People's Liberation Army.

The two-year and seven-month War of Liberation in North China has advanced along the road of the development of the national War of Liberation, and it is also one of the main streams of the entire War of Liberation.

When the Kuomintang reactionaries launched a full-scale offensive against the liberated areas in July 1946, the North China People's Liberation Army, like the People's Liberation Army in other regions, was in a state of strategic defense against the enemy's strategic offensive. At that time, the Kuomintang bandit army concentrated a large number of troops, up to seventy brigades (divisions) at most, on the Longhai, Pinghan and Datong-Puzhou three lines in the south and the Suiyuan East, Rehe West and Ping-Sui East sections in the north, and invaded in several routes with an aggressive momentum. The People's Liberation Army, disregarding the gains and losses of one city or one place, concentrated its forces to annihilate the enemy's effective strength, took big steps forward and backward, created opportunities to annihilate the enemy, and gradually annihilated the enemy in batches. In August and September, the People's Liberation Army went deep into the Kaifeng and Xuzhou sections of the Longhai Line and the area north of it, and in the Heze area, annihilated four enemy brigades in one fell swoop, and won a victory by annihilating the enemy north of Baoding, thwarting the enemy's fierce offensive. However, at that time, the People's Liberation Army was not only inferior to the enemy in terms of quantity, equipment, and combat readiness, but also had just transformed from guerrilla warfare during the Anti-Japanese War to regular warfare, so the situation was quite difficult. However, the People's Liberation Army finally wiped out more than 200,000 enemy troops in six months, while voluntarily withdrawing from sixty-five county towns, giving the greedy enemy a big burden to carry. Although the enemy once rushed to the Daming and Linzhang areas of southern Hebei on the southern front, and occupied most or part of eastern Suiyuan, Chahar, and northern Yan, and occupied Zhangjiakou on the northern front, it was out of breath. From February to April 1947, with the victorious coordination of other fraternal liberated areas, the North China People's Liberation Army seized the initiative of the war and launched continuous offensives. When the Kuomintang bandit army attacked Yan'an in March, the North China People's Liberation Army attacked its flanks, sweeping through more than ten county towns on both sides of the Datong-Puzhou Road in southwestern Shanxi, leaving the Kuomintang bandit army in that area trapped in a few isolated cities such as Yuncheng, Linfen, and Anyi. In the Hebei-Shandong-Henan area, the People's Liberation Army once again went deep into the Longhai Line, continuously annihilating large numbers of enemies, forcing the enemy to retreat and defend the south bank of the Yellow River. Then the People's Liberation Army pointed westward along the Pinghan Line in northern Henan, basically eliminating the Kuomintang local bandit armed forces in the area, causing the Kuomintang bandit army to lose its claws, teeth and eyes. This victory was of equal significance to annihilating the enemy's regular army at that time. On the northern front, the People's Liberation Army liberated Dingxian and Xinle, two cities on the Pinghan Line, cut off the northern section of the Pinghan Line, and then bypassed Shijiazhuang and pointed west along the Zhengtai Road, directly under the city of Yuci, leaving the enemy in Shijiazhuang isolated. This victory connected the central Hebei and northern Mount Heng regions of the Jin-Chahar-Hebei Border Region, and connected the original Jin-Hebei-Shandong-Henan and Jin-Chahar-Hebei Liberated Areas not only on the Hebei Plain east of the Pinghan Road, but also in the Taihang and northern Mount Heng regions west of the Pinghan Road.

In the first year of the war, the North China People's Liberation Army annihilated a total of 29 and a half brigades of enemy regular army, and 430,000 enemy non-regular troops, recovering and liberating 40 county towns. This great victory and the victory of the land reform movement, which was in full swing at the time, laid a solid foundation for the North China People's Liberation Army to fight into the Kuomintang-controlled areas in the second year of the war.

The three armies of the People's Liberation Army, Liu-Deng, Chen-Su, and Chen-Xie, crossed the Yellow River and advanced into the Central Plains, which fundamentally changed the entire War of Liberation. The enemy changed from strategic offense to strategic defense, and the People's Liberation Army changed from strategic defense to strategic offense. At the end of June 1947, the army of General Liu Bocheng and Deng Xiaoping, whose troops were unprecedentedly improved in quality and quantity due to the enthusiastic participation of liberated peasants, crossed the natural barrier of the Yellow River in one fell swoop, and continuously annihilated nine and a half enemy brigades in the southwestern Shandong area in twenty-one days. They then took advantage of the victory to cross the Longhai Road and drove straight into the Dabie Mountains. Soon, the armies of Generals Chen Geng and Xie Fuzhi and the armies of Generals Chen Yi and Su Yu also crossed the river one after another, forming a pin-shaped advance with the Liu-Deng army. This strategic deployment of the People's Liberation Army was completely unexpected by the Kuomintang reactionaries. The pliers of the Kuomintang bandit army, which took the key offensives in East China and Northwest as two prongs, were broken from the middle. A large number of Kuomintang bandit troops followed the three armies of Liu-Deng, Chen-Su, and Chen-Xie southward and were attracted to the Central Plains battlefield. This situation greatly facilitated the powerful People's Liberation Army, which remained in North China, to annihilate the enemy in the heartland of North China.

Therefore, in October, the People's Liberation Army won the great victory of Qingfengdian on the Pinghan Line, annihilating the enemy's Third Army, and then captured Shijiazhuang, which was equipped with "permanent and strong fortifications", setting a precedent for capturing enemy-defended cities in Guannei. After that, the People's Liberation Army also won a great victory in the siege battles in Yuncheng and Linfen and other cities on the Datong-Puzhou Line. The construction and development of artillery and engineering units, as well as the new-style military rectification movement of the troops, played a decisive role in the People's Liberation Army's ability to successfully carry out the siege warfare to capture these cities. On the Pingbao and PingSui Lines, the People's Liberation Army also launched continuous offensives, recovering vast areas such as southern Chahar, northern Yan, and eastern Suiyuan, and paralyzing the PingSui and Pingbao Lines. By June 1948, the People's Liberation Army had launched a large-scale offensive against Yan Xishan's bandit army in central Shanxi.

In the second year of the war, the People's Liberation Army annihilated a total of 13 brigades of enemy regular army and more than 280,000 enemy non-regular troops (excluding the results of the Liu-Deng and Chen-Xie armies), recovering and liberating 31 cities. The heartland of North China was largely cleared of the enemy. This huge victory created sufficient conditions for the merger of the Jin-Hebei-Shandong-Henan and Jin-Chahar-Hebei liberated areas into one North China liberated area, and paved the way for the struggle to liberate the whole of North China in the third year of the war.

The great victory of the Jinzhong Campaign began the third year of operations. In this campaign, the People's Liberation Army annihilated a total of one army group headquarters, five army headquarters, and more than nine divisions, totaling more than 100,000 of Yan Xishan's bandit troops, recovering 14 county towns, making Yan Xishan's bandit lair - Taiyuan completely isolated.

Then, the People's Liberation Army from all over the country, after the new-style military rectification, successively launched a great offensive. In September and October 1948, the North China People's Liberation Army cooperated with the East China People's Liberation Army and the Central Plains People's Liberation Army's Jinan, Zhengzhou, Kaifeng, and Huaihai Campaigns, liberating all the people on the south bank of the Yellow River in Hebei-Shandong-Henan who had persisted in fighting in an extremely difficult guerrilla environment. The enemy who originally occupied the Anyang and Xinxiang to Jiaozuo line in northern Henan and the area south of it were compressed into several isolated cities such as Anyang, Xinxiang, and Huixian. On the northern front, the North China People's Liberation Army cooperated with the Northeast People's Liberation Army in liberating the entire Northeast. At this time, the situation on the northern front was like this: the People's Liberation Army first launched an offensive on the Pinggu Line at the eastern end of the enemy in North China. When the enemy concentrated its forces to reinforce the Pinggu Line, the People's Liberation Army swept across the Zhangjiakou to Jining section of the PingSui Line on the enemy's western front. When the enemy returned from the eastern front to reinforce, the People's Liberation Army launched an offensive on the Beijing to Zhangjiakou section of the PingSui Line, and then attacked the western end of the PingSui Line, capturing Baotou. The People's Liberation Army was hitting the enemy by maneuvering east, west, front, and back, while the enemy was in a predicament of being unable to attend to both ends, running around in circles, and being exhausted. The enemy, making a final struggle, conspired to launch a sneak attack on Shijiazhuang, but it was unable to realize this conspiracy. As soon as it began to act, it was crushed by the People's Liberation Army. At this time, the Northeast Kuomintang bandit army had completely collapsed, and the last days of the enemy in North China were coming. The panicked enemy quickly fled from Baoding, distributing its forces along the line from Tangshan to Zhangjiakou in order to protect itself.

On November 23, only twenty days after the liberation of the entire Northeast, the Northeast People's Liberation Army poured into Guannei, and the great war to liberate the entire North China began.

Because they did not expect the Northeast People's Liberation Army to come so quickly and in such large numbers, the enemy was panic-stricken. And the Northeast People's Liberation Army and the North China People's Liberation Army, which came like a storm from both the east and west ends, and then from all directions, did not give the enemy time to shrink and gather its forces, and completely divided and surrounded the enemy in five isolated strongholds in Zhangjiakou, Xinbaoan, Peiping, Tianjin, and Tanggu. Then, from December 22 to 24 last year, the enemy in Xinbaoan and Zhangjiakou were annihilated one after another, and on January 15 this year, the Tianjin defenders who resolutely resisted were annihilated and Tanggu was liberated. These victories led the Kuomintang army in Peiping, which was completely trapped in a desperate situation, to finally accept the proposal of the People's Liberation Army and peacefully resolve the Peiping issue. On January 31, the People's Liberation Army officially entered the city of Peiping, and this world-famous ancient capital was liberated from now on.

Since the Anti-Japanese War, after eleven years and seven months of long and cruel struggle, the military and civilians in the North China liberated area have not only defeated Japanese imperialism and its running dogs on the North China battlefield, but also defeated the Kuomintang reactionaries supported by US imperialism. Now the glorious mission of the military and civilians in the North China liberated area is to assist the liberation of the whole of China and the construction of a new democratic North China. The history of North China is now turning a new page.

    新华社记者综述华北伟大解放战争
    【新华社华北二十三日电】记者综述华北两年七个月的伟大的解放战争称（山东和山西西部未包括在内）：平津解放后，华北已基本上全部解放了。现在国民党匪军仅仅盘踞着太原、大同、新乡、安阳等几个孤立的城市，这几个在美丽的华北地图上不过是极渺小的污点，不久也将被解放军所扫除了。
    两年七个月的华北解放战争是沿着全国解放战争发展的道路前进的，它并是整个解放战争中的主流之一。
    当一九四六年七月国民党反动集团向解放区发动全面进攻时，华北解放军与其他地区的解放军一样，处于敌人战略进攻自己战略防御的态势下。当时国民党匪军在南线的陇海、平汉和同蒲三线和北线的绥东、热西和平绥东段集中了大量兵力，最多时达七十个旅（师），分路进犯，来势汹汹。解放军则在不计一城一地的得失，集中兵力歼灭敌人有生力量的方针下，大踏步进退，创造歼敌战机，逐步地逐批地歼灭敌人。八、九月间解放军即先后深入陇海线开封、徐州段及其以北地区于菏泽一带一举歼敌四个旅，并于保定以北歼敌获胜，顿挫了敌人进攻的凶焰。但是，当时解放军不仅在数量上、装备上和作战准备上劣于敌人，而且刚从抗日时期的游击战争转变为正规战争，因此处境是相当艰难的。但是，人民解放军终于在六个月中消灭了敌军共二十余万人，同时主动撤出了六十五座县城，给贪婪的敌人背上加了一个大包袱。因为敌人虽然在南线曾一度奔窜到冀南的大名、临漳一带，在北线则侵占了绥东、察哈尔、雁北的大部或一部，并侵占了张家口，但是它喘不过气来了。自一九四七年的二月至四月，在其他兄弟解放区的胜利配合下，华北解放军就取得了战争的主动权，连续发动了攻势。当三月间国民党匪军进攻延安时，华北解放军即拊其侧背，席卷了晋西南同蒲路两侧十余县城，使该地国民党匪军困守于运城、临汾和安邑等少数孤城。在冀鲁豫地区，解放军再度深入陇海沿线，连续地大量歼灭敌人，迫敌退守黄河南岸。接着解放军又西指豫北平汉沿线，基本上扫除了该地国民党地方土匪武装，使国民党匪军失去了爪牙耳目。这一胜利在当时是与歼灭敌正规军具有同等重大意义的。在北线解放军则解放了平汉线的定县和新乐两城，截断平汉线北段，继即绕过石家庄，沿正太路西指，直薄榆次城下，使石家庄敌人陷于孤立。这一胜利使晋察冀边区的冀中与北岳连成一片，并使原晋冀鲁豫和晋察冀两解放区不仅在平汉路东的河北平原上，而且在平汉路西的太行与北岳两区连成一片。
    总计在战争第一年中华北解放军共歼敌正规军二十九个半旅，连敌非正规军共四十三万人，收复和解放县城四十座。这一伟大胜利和当时正轰轰烈烈进行中的土地改革运动的胜利，奠定了华北解放军在战争第二年中打向国民党统治区去的雄厚基础。
    解放军刘邓、陈粟、陈谢三支大军渡过黄河，挺进中原，使整个解放战争在第二年起了根本变化，敌人由战略进攻转变为战略防御，解放军则由战略防御转变为战略进攻。一九四七年六月底，由于翻身农民踊跃参军而使部队在质与量上空前提高的刘伯承、邓小平两将军所部大军，一举渡过黄河天险，并在鲁西南地区二十一天中连续歼敌九个半旅，继即乘胜横跨陇海路，向大别山长驱挺进。不久，陈赓、谢富治两将军所部和陈毅、粟裕两将军所部的两支大军亦相继渡河，与刘邓大军形成品字形前进。解放军这一战略展开是完全出于国民党反动集团意料之外的。当时以华东和西北的重点进攻为两个钳头的国民党匪军的这把钳子，一下从中间被砸断了。大股的国民党匪军紧跟着刘邓、陈粟、陈谢等三支大军南下，并被吸引在中原战场。这一形势就大大便利了留在华北的强大解放军在华北腹地歼灭敌人。
    因此，在十月间解放军就赢得了平汉线清风店大捷，歼敌第三军，接着，一举攻克了设有“永久性强固防御工事”的石家庄，首创关内攻克敌设防较坚固城市的范例。此后，解放军又在同蒲线运城、临汾等城市取得了攻坚战的大捷。解放军所以能胜利地进行夺取这些城市的攻坚战，炮兵和工兵的建设与发展以及部队的新式整军运动是有决定作用的。在平保和平绥线，解放军也接连展开了进攻，收复了察南、雁北和绥东等广大地区，并使平绥、平保两线陷于瘫痪。至一九四八年六月，解放军又展开了对晋中阎锡山匪军的大规模进攻。
    战争的第二年中，解放军在华北共歼敌正规军十三个旅，连敌非正规军共二十八万余人（刘邓、陈谢大军的战果不在内），收复和解放城市三十一座，华北腹心地区的敌人大部被肃清。这一巨大胜利为晋冀鲁豫和晋察冀两解放区合并为一个华北解放区造成了充分的条件，也为战争的第三年解放全华北的斗争铺平了道路。
    晋中战役的巨大胜利开始了第三年的作战。在这一战役中解放军共歼灭阎锡山匪军一个集团军司令部，五个军部，九个多师共十余万人，收复了十四座县城，使阎锡山的匪巢——太原完全陷于孤立。
    接着，经过了新式整训的各地解放军相继展开伟大的进攻。在一九四八年九、十月间华北解放军配合华东解放军和中原解放军的济南、郑州、开封和淮海战役，使在异常艰苦的游击环境下坚持斗争的冀鲁豫黄河南岸的人民全部解放，原占有豫北安阳和新乡至焦作一线及其以南地区的敌人则被压缩到安阳、新乡及辉县几个孤城。在北线，华北解放军配合了东北解放军解放全东北的作战。这时北线出现了这样的局势，解放军首先在华北敌人的东头平古线上展开进攻，当敌人集中兵力增援到平古线时，解放军就又在敌人的西线横扫平绥线的张家口至集宁段；当敌人自东线回援时，解放军又在平绥线北平至张家口段展开了进攻，接着又打向平绥线的西端。攻克了包头。解放军是在敌人的东西前后机动地打击着敌人，敌人则陷于首尾不顾、东奔西跑、疲于奔命的窘境。作最后挣扎的敌人曾阴谋偷袭石家庄，但它已无力实现这个阴谋了，在它刚一开始行动就被解放军粉碎了。这时，东北国民党匪军全军崩溃了，华北敌人的末日即将来临了。惊慌的敌人迅速从保定逃跑，将兵力分布于自唐山至张家口一线，以求自保。
    十一月二十三日，解放全东北后不过二十天，东北解放军汹涌入关，解放全华北的伟大战争开始了。
    因为没有料想到东北解放军来得这样快，这样多，敌人惊慌失措了。而象疾风暴雨一样从东西两端，接着是从四面八方打来的东北解放军和华北解放军，没有让敌人来得及收缩集结兵力，就把敌人完全分割包围于张家口、新保安、北平、天津和塘沽五个孤立据点内。紧接着于去年十二月二十二日至二十四日先后歼灭了新保安和张家口的敌人，今年一月十五日又歼灭了坚决抵抗的天津守敌并解放了塘沽。这些胜利使完全陷于绝境的北平国民党军最后接受解放军的提议，和平解决了北平问题。一月三十一日，解放军正式开入北平城，这个世界著名的古都从此解放。
    从抗日战争以来，经过了十一年七个月长期的残酷的斗争的华北解放区军民，在华北战场不仅战胜了日本帝国主义及其走狗，而且战胜了美帝国主义扶助的国民党反动派。现在华北解放区军民的光荣使命是援助全中国的解放和建设新民主主义的华北。华北的历史现在正翻开新的一页。
