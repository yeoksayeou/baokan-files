    Liuke Village Cadre Shen Tongfu
    Forces Zhang Youmei to Exchange Donkey and Mule

    To the Editors of the People's Daily:
    I am a poor peasant. During the land reform struggle, I was allocated a donkey as part of my share of the fruits of liberation. After feeding it for several months, it gave birth to a small mule in March of last year. I put in a lot of effort to raise the little mule, and it grew strong and lovely. Shen Tongfu (a cadre in the village), saw how well my little mule was growing and developed a fondness for it. He colluded with a certain district cadre stationed in our village, and relying on their power, they came to my house and forcibly took away both the donkey and the little mule. Shen Tongfu had an old ox at his house, so he sent the old ox to my house and said, "I'll exchange it for your animals!" His unreasonable and forceful seizure of my livestock has caused me immense grievance and oppression, but I dare not speak out. I implore the editors to help me resolve this issue.

    Respectfully,

    Zhang Youmei, Liuke Village, Fifth District, Shahe County
    December 18th

　　留客村干部申同福
  　强迫换张友梅驴骡人民日报社编辑同志：
    我是一个贫农，我在土地改革斗争时期，分到翻身果实驴子一头，经喂养了数月，于去年三月间，生下了一个小骡子，我费很大功夫将小骡养大了，小骡长的壮实可爱。我村的申同福（是村中干部），见我这小骡子长的很好，即起了爱骡之心，与某某住在我村的区干部说通，依仗势力，到我家中将驴和小骡子一块强霸拉走。他家有一头老牛，申同福便将老牛送到我家中说道：“给你换个老牛吧！”他这样无理强霸我的牲口，使我受到这万分的委屈和压迫。不敢出声。请编辑同志能帮助我解决这一问题。敬礼！
