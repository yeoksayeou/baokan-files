　　The Kuomintang-Controlled Areas are Wretched
  　Public Servants and Teachers Lead Increasingly Hard Lives
    Xiamen University Students Work as Laborers to Make Ends Meet
    [Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 20th] Public servants and teachers in the Kuomintang-controlled areas are living increasingly difficult lives. Even members of the pseudo-Supervisory Yuan have had to admit: "The cost-of-living index for public servants and teachers has not been adjusted, making it difficult to maintain a livelihood." Since the "currency reform" on August 19th of last year, the pseudo-government's general public utility fees have increased 700 times, while the salaries of general public servants and teachers have only increased 15 times (as revealed by Kuomintang Central News Agency, Nanjing, on the 14th and 15th). The "Shanghai University and College Professors' Friendship Association," due to the difficulty professors face in maintaining their livelihoods, specifically sent representatives to Nanjing on the 14th of this month to petition the pseudo-Acting President Li Zongren, requesting improved treatment. The Shanghai Municipal Kuomintang "United Association of Employees of Central Government Agencies," based on reports from its affiliated units, declared that even the salary income of general mid-level civil servants is currently only enough to buy two dou (each dou is 14 catties) of rice, and those who eat large pancakes and fried dough sticks for breakfast have become "big spenders." The lives of general students are even more miserable. Some students at Xiamen University, in order to make ends meet, in addition to teaching, have recently been earning a little income by selling water and working as construction laborers. As for the general Shandong and Henan refugee students who were deceived by the Kuomintang to go to Jiangnan and accommodated in "temporary middle schools," their lives are even more tragic because the pseudo-Ministry of Education deliberately delays and withholds funding and food allowances.

　　国民党统治区一片凄惨
  　公教人员生活越来越苦
    厦大学生做小工维持生活
    【新华社陕北二十日电】国民党统治区公教人员生活越来越困苦。伪监察院委员也不得不承认：“公教人员生活指数迄未调整，以致生活难于维持。”伪政府一般公用事业收费自去年八月十九日“改革币制”以来已加价七百倍，而一般公教人员的薪金却仅增加了十五倍（国民党中央社南京十四日及十五日消息披露）。上海“专科以上学校教授联谊会”因教授维持生活困难，特于本月十四日推派代表赴南京向伪代总统李宗仁请愿，要求改善待遇。上海市国民党“中央各机关员工联合会”则根据该会所属各单位员工的报告宣称：即一般中级公务员之薪金收入目前亦仅能购米两斗（每斗十四斤），早餐以大饼油条充饥者已成“豪客”。一般学生生活更其痛苦。厦门大学部分学生为维持生活，除担任教书工作外，近来并以卖水、作建筑小工等方法换取一点收入。至于一般被国民党骗往江南收容到“临时中学”里的山东、河南流亡学生们，因伪教育部故意将经费、伙食拖欠不发，生活更是悲惨到极点。
