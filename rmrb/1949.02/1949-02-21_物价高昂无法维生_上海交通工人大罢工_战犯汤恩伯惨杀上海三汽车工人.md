Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 18th – Concurrent with the strike by Shanghai Transportation Automotive Company workers, workers on the Shanghai-Nanjing and Shanghai-Hangzhou-Ningbo Railways, as well as workers at the Shanghai French Tram Company, also held strikes. Low wages and soaring prices have made it difficult for workers to maintain their livelihoods, so the striking workers are all demanding reasonable adjustments to their wages based on rice prices. The strike by workers on the Shanghai-Nanjing and Shanghai-Hangzhou-Ningbo Railways lasted for two full days from the 15th to the 16th. Several thousand of them collectively boarded a train on the evening of the 16th to go to Shanghai to petition the railway bureau. The puppet Shanghai municipal authorities sent a large number of troops to suppress them and dismantled a section of the railway track near the western suburbs of Shanghai to prevent the arrival of the "strike workers' train." However, under the workers' tenacious persistence, the Kuomintang Railway Bureau was eventually forced to agree to some of their demands. The strike at the French Tram Company had not yet been resolved as of the evening of the 16th.

Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 18th – Chen Daqing, the puppet Songhu Garrison Commander, ordered the execution on the 17th of Gu Bokang, Zhong Quanzhou, and Wang Yuan, three Shanghai Transportation Automotive Company workers who led the strike to demand improved treatment. It is reported that this crime was personally decided by the war criminal, puppet "Kyoto-Shanghai-Hangzhou Area Garrison Commander," Tang Enbo. This incident has aroused great agitation among all sectors of opinion here. The workers say: The incorrigible murderers Tang Enbo and Chen Daqing must pay with their lives for the lives of the victims.

　　物价高昂无法维生
  　上海交通工人大罢工
    战犯汤恩伯惨杀上海三汽车工人
    【新华社陕北十八日电】与上海交通汽车公司工人的罢工同时，沪宁、沪杭甬两铁路工人和上海法商电车公司工人也举行了罢工。工资的低微和物价的高涨已使工人生活困难维持下去，所以罢工的工人都要求按照米价合理调整他们的工资。沪宁、沪杭甬两铁路工人的罢工，从十五日至十六日坚持了两整天。他们中的数千人曾于十六日晚集体坐上火车开往上海向路局请愿。伪上海市当局派了大批军队前去镇压他们，并拆毁了上海西郊附近的一段路轨，以阻止“罢工工人专车”的到达。但在工人们顽强的坚持下，国民党铁路局终被迫答应了他们一部分的要求。法商电车公司的罢工至十六日晚仍未获得解决。
    【新华社陕北十八日电】伪淞沪警备司令陈大庆于十七日下令枪杀了为要求改善待遇领导罢工的上海交通汽车公司工人顾伯康、钟泉周、王元三人。据悉，这一罪行是战争罪犯伪“京沪杭区警备总司令”汤恩伯亲自决定的。这件事情引起了此间各界舆论的激动。工人们说：必须叫怙恶不悛的凶手汤恩伯和陈大庆为牺牲者偿命。
