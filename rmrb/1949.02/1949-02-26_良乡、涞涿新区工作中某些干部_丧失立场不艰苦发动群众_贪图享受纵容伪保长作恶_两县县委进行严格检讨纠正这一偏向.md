Editor's Note: The puppet Baojia (Neighborhood Watch) system must be thoroughly destroyed. After examination, ordinary puppet Baojia personnel who can be retained should be retained by the democratic government, giving them an opportunity to repent, turn over a new leaf, and perform meritorious service to atone for their crimes. This is by no means recognizing their legal status in the democratic regime. Some cadres in Liangxiang and Laizhuo do not arduously mobilize and rely on the masses to destroy the puppet Baojia system step by step and establish a democratic regime; instead, they bureaucratically keep their work limited to the puppet Baojia personnel, and even indulge in enjoyment and connive with the puppet Baizhang to continue to do evil and oppress the people. This serious right-leaning error should be given great importance by the local county party committee. According to branch reports, the county party committee has conducted a self-criticism on this, which is good; but it is still necessary to find the root causes of this error from the ideological, positional, and work style aspects, draw lessons, and improve all county cadres as a result. At the same time, comrades who have made serious mistakes should be appropriately dealt with, and specific methods for changing work styles and improving work in the future should be formulated. We hope to continue to report on the specific circumstances of how the two county committees handle this issue.

[Zhangyuan Electric] Branch reports: The Liangxiang and Laizhuo (newly established county combining parts of Laishui and Zhuozhou) County Committees of the Communist Party of China have conducted self-criticism on the serious right-leaning deviations that have arisen among some cadres in their work in the new district, and have adopted methods such as conducting criticism and self-criticism, strictly enforcing discipline, and explaining policies to correct them. Instead of adopting a step-by-step and thorough dismantling of the puppet Baojia system, some cadres in these two counties simply changed puppet Bao offices into our village offices without principle, and indiscriminately changed puppet Baizhang into our village chiefs without distinction. The Second District of Liangxiang announced that puppet Baizhang would retain their "original positions and salaries," allowing some bad elements to put on a legal facade and continue to commit wrongdoings. Some cadres even indulged in enjoyment, became corrupt and degenerate, did not care about the suffering of the masses, lost their stance, and supported the Baizhang. The deputy captain of the People's Armed Forces Brigade in the Eighth District of Laizhuo ate and drank with the Baizhang of Du Village, even allowing him to apportion rice in the name of the school, eating and drinking lavishly. This phenomenon also existed in many other villages. Each meal cost no less than 1,500 to 1,600 yuan (RMB). The instructor of the armed forces in the district ate and drank heavily at the home of the puppet Baizhang in Dijia Village. An old lady appealed to him, accusing the Baizhang of embezzling her son's pension. Not only did he fail to express sympathy for this matter, but he also said without any stance: "I don't have time to solve this problem." The deputy secretary of the district committee of the district went to the house of the puppet Baizhang in Changdian Village to investigate guns. The puppet Baizhang invited him to eat and drink. Not only did he not ask for the guns, but when the district head wanted the guns, he defended the puppet Baizhang, saying: "There are really no guns." In some villages in the Fourth District of Liangxiang, the masses were dissatisfied with the puppet Baizhang's favoritism and corruption and refused their unreasonable apportionments. The local cadres not only did not investigate the situation and deal with it, but instead attacked the masses and reported to the county that "the masses were educated at the conference, and the Baizhang were supported." Many cadres in the Eighth District of Laizhuo believe that if the Baizhang says there is no problem in the village, then there is no problem. The standard for measuring the quality of work in a village is whether the Baizhang is working actively, so that our work only remains with the puppet Baojia personnel. In the past, the Laizhuo County Party Committee believed that the Eighth District of the county was mostly old cadres, and did not promptly and specifically inspect the work. The district party committee secretary believed that "a little bit of guerrilla style is inevitable when old cadres go to the new district." This further contributed to the development of the right-leaning errors of some cadres in the district. Another phenomenon is the distortion of the leniency policy, with unconditional leniency being given even to reactionary elements who have committed heinous crimes and refuse to bow their heads. Several traitorous elements in Huangshandian in the Fourth District of Liangxiang committed many evils during the enemy and puppet rule, and the masses hated them to the bone. After the liberation of Fangshan, they ran to Changxindian with the enemy. After the liberation of Changxindian, they had nowhere to escape and returned home to hide their guns. Instead of punishing these bad elements, a certain cadre said at a mass meeting, losing his stance: "The government should be responsible for their betrayal (!?), It is glorious to hand over the guns, and the government will help solve any difficulties in the future." This caused great dissatisfaction among the masses.

　　良乡、涞涿新区工作中某些干部
    丧失立场不艰苦发动群众
    贪图享受纵容伪保长作恶
    两县县委进行严格检讨纠正这一偏向
    编者按：对伪保甲政权必须予以彻底摧毁，对一般伪保甲人员经审查后，由民主政府分别其可留用者留用，是给以悔过自新，立功赎罪的机会，决不是承认其在民主政权中已有合法地位。良乡、涞涿某些干部不艰苦发动群众，依靠群众，有步骤的摧毁伪保甲政权，建立民主政权；而是官僚主义的把工作停留在伪保甲人员身上，甚至还贪图享受，纵容伪保长继续作恶，压迫人民。对这种严重的右倾错误，应引起当地县委的十分重视，据分社报导，县委对此已进行了检讨，这是好的；但仍应从思想上、立场上、作风上找出这一错误的产生根源，吸取教训，使全县干部因此而得到提高；同时对犯错误严重同志应予以适当处理；并从而规定出今后转变作风，改进工作的具体方法。两县委对此问题处理的具体情况，望继续报导。
     【张垣电】分社报导：良乡、涞涿（新设县涞水，涿县各一部）两县中共县委对某些干部在新区工作中产生的严重右倾偏向，进行了检讨，并采取开展批评与自我批评，严明纪律讲解政策等方法，予以纠正。该两县某些干部在新区对伪保甲政权不是采取有步骤的彻底摧毁的方针，而是无原则的把伪保公所改为我之村公所，无分别的一律把伪保长改为我之村长，良乡二区宣布伪保长“原职原薪”，以致使某些坏分子穿上合法外衣，继续为非作恶。甚至有些干部贪图享受，腐化堕落，不关心群众疾苦，丧失了立场，为保长撑腰。涞涿八区人民武装部大队副，与杜村保长在一块吃喝，竟然许他以学校名义摊派大米，大吃大喝，其他不少村庄也有此现象。吃喝一顿不下一千五六百元（人民币）。该区武装部指导员在邸家场伪保长家大吃大喝，一个老太太向他申诉冤屈，控告保长贪污他儿子的抚恤金，他对此事不但未表示同情，反而毫无立场的说：“没时间解决这个问题。”该区区委副书记，到常店村伪保长处清查枪支，伪保长请他吃喝一顿，他不但不要枪了，当该区区长要枪时，反而替伪保长辩护说：“真没有枪”。良乡四区有些村群众不满意伪保长徇私贪污，拒绝他们不合理的摊派，当地干部不但未调查情况，进行处理，反而打击群众，给县里汇报说：“在大会上教育了群众，给保长撑了一下腰。”涞涿八区不少干部认为：保长说村里没问题，就是没问题。衡量某村工作好坏的标准，就是保长工作是否积极；致使我们的工作只停留在伪保甲人员身上。涞涿县委过去认为该县八区多是老干部，没有及时具体的检查工作；区委书记则认为“老干部到新区，一点半点的游击作风是不可避免的”。这就更助长了该区部分干部右倾错误的发展。另一现象是曲解宽大政策，对罪大恶极不肯低头的反动分子也无原则的宽大。良乡四区黄山店的几个叛徒分子，在敌伪统治时期，为非作恶，群众恨之入骨。房山解放后他们跟敌人跑到长辛店，长辛店解放后，无处可逃才回家把枪藏起来。对这种坏分子不但不予以惩办，某干部反而在群众大会上丧失立场的说：“他们叛变，政府应负责任（！？），缴出枪是光荣的，往后有什么困难，政府帮助解决。”引起群众的极大不满。
