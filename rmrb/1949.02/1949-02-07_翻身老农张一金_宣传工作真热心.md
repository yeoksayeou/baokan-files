Peasant Zhang Yijin, Who Turned Over to Become Master, Is Truly Enthusiastic About Propaganda Work

	Going west along the Hutuo River from Zhuangwo Village in Nanping Third District, one can see many slogans and cartoons suitable for central work on the roadside stones and earthen mounds. After entering Nanzhuang Village (Sixth District), there are even more of these slogans and cartoons. From Nanzhuang north to Gongshang Village, southwest to Gudao Village, and west to Jishi Village, slogans and cartoons in the same handwriting can be seen on the roads spanning dozens of miles. Many people passing through here are surprised and ask, "Who has the patience to write so many slogans?" It turns out that this is the achievement of Zhang Yijin, a 58-year-old man from Nanzhuang Village. Before the War of Resistance Against Japan, this old man had only two fen of land and lived a lonely life. Life forced him to learn painting skills to make a living. After the Anti-Japanese War, with the help of the democratic government, he obtained eight mu of land and got married, living a life of plenty. He knows that this happiness was brought to him by the revolution, so he is also loyal to the revolution. Relying on his good craftsmanship, whenever central work is arranged, he automatically takes the slogans issued by the higher authorities from the village office, carries a bucket of white powder, and writes all over the village and other places (he also brushes over the old slogans). Especially during this year's army expansion, he wrote even more and beautifully, which played a great role in the army expansion.

　　翻身老农张一金
    宣传工作真热心
    从南屏三区的庄窝村沿滹沱河往西走，在路旁的石头上土＠上，到处都可以看到许多适宜中心工作的标语和漫画，迈进南庄村（六区）以后，这种标语漫画就更多了。从南庄往北到工上村，西南到古道村，西到鸡石村，这样纵横几十里地的路上，都有这同样手笔的标语漫画。许多从这里走过的人，都惊奇的问“是谁有这么大耐心写这么多标语？”原来这是南庄村的一位五十八岁的老人张一金的功绩。这位老人抗日战争前，只有二分地，一人过着孤单的日子，生活迫使他学会了一手画画技术，以此糊口。抗战后在民主政府帮助下，得到了八亩地，又结了婚，过着丰衣足食的生活。他知道这种幸福是革命带给他的，因而他也忠心为革命。凭了他一手好手艺，当每次中心工作布置下来时，他便自动的与村公所拿了上级发下的口号，提一筒白粉子，写遍全村和其他地方（旧标语也是他刷），特别今年的扩军中他写的更多而漂亮，对扩军起了很大作用。
