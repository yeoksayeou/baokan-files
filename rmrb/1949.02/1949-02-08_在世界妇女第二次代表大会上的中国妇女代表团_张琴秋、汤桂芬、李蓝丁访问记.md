The Chinese women's delegation attending the Second World Women's Congress convened by the Women's International Democratic Federation has returned from Budapest. The reporter conducted an interview with Zhang Qinqiu, Tang Guifen, and Li Landing from the delegation. They excitedly and happily spoke to the reporter about the circumstances of the conference, unanimously praising it as a successful meeting.

Zhang Qinqiu said: "This conference was an unprecedented meeting of solidarity for democratic women worldwide. It fully demonstrated the rapid expansion and strengthening of the international democratic women's camp over the past three years. The number of member countries of the Women's International Democratic Federation has increased from thirty-three three years ago to fifty-six now, with over 80 million members. Despite the reactionary governments of some countries obstructing in various ways, women's groups from forty countries, representing fifty nationalities, still sent 385 delegates to the conference. These delegates included politicians, scientists, writers, artists, and various workers. In particular, the Soviet delegation had the most impressive lineup, consisting of thirty-eight delegates, including politicians, scientists, writers, musicians, as well as various labor heroes and model workers. Many of the delegates attending the conference had arrived after much struggle. For example, the dozen or so armed representatives of Free Greece broke through the reactionary government's blockade and walked to Budapest on foot. Tang Guifen and Li Wenyi from our Chinese delegation also broke through the blockade of the Kuomintang reactionary government to attend the conference. All of this demonstrates the unprecedented strengthening of the solidarity of democratic women worldwide." After hearing the report by Italian representative Mrs. Rossi on the task of women in the struggle for peace and democracy, the conference unanimously and enthusiastically adopted the "Defend Peace" declaration, which will play a significant role in uniting international democratic women to prevent new fascist wars and defend peace in the future. At the same time, it will be a great impetus for the entire world democratic movement. The conference solemnly condemned the instigators of new wars, exposed the conspiracies of American and British imperialism in preparing for new wars, and protested the bloody terror of the Greek reactionary government and Franco of Spain. At the same time, the conference expressed its boundless love and support for the Soviet Union, the bastion of world peace, and its leader Stalin, its admiration and respect for the Chinese People's Liberation Army, the Chinese people, and their leader Mao Zedong, who are fighting for freedom and peace, and its encouragement and support for the people's wars being waged in Greece, Spain, Vietnam, Indonesia, and other countries. Comrade Zhang Qinqiu excitedly said: "At the conference, the Soviet representatives were frequently honored with standing ovations whenever they spoke, and they shouted 'Long Live Stalin.' When our representatives reported on each victory of the Chinese People's Liberation Army in liberating Jinan and Shenyang and advancing towards Pingjin, it aroused continuous applause and repeated cheers of 'Long Live Mao Zedong.'" She cited the following scene to illustrate the conference's strong will to defend peace. When the conference passed the declaration, everyone stood up, applause thundered, and delegates from various countries and hundreds of guests sang their national anthems or songs encouraging struggle. Loud slogans such as "Defend World Peace!" "Oppose New Imperialist War!" "Support Stalin!" swept the entire venue like waves, and colorful paper ribbons flew like snowflakes throughout the hall. The representatives, especially those on the presidium, the Soviet Union, and our Chinese representatives, were covered in colorful paper scraps and strips, eliciting laughter from the entire audience. The representatives shouted loudly "Gonickin-Gordon!" "Nina Popova!" "Cai Chang!" for a long time. (Note: Gordon is the chairman of the Women's International Democratic Federation, and Popova and Cai Chang are vice-chairmen.)

Tang Guifen and Li Landing described to the reporter with overflowing emotion the love and respect the delegation received. Tang Guifen said: "At mass rallies, we were often surrounded by people, with handshakes, hugs, kisses, photos, inquiries, requests for gifts, and autographs coming from all directions, making it difficult to handle. At mass rallies, when women and children offering flowers and gifts walked towards the podium, the crowds below would shout 'Soviet Union!' 'China!' meaning that their gifts should first be given to the representatives of the Soviet Union and China. At one mass rally, Hungarian farmers gave the pigeons they raised to the Soviet representatives, indicating that the Soviet Union is the defender of peace; and gave small piglets to our representatives, wishing the people of our country happiness in life after the victory of the Liberation War." Tang Guifen also said: "At a mass gathering, I was hugged by an old lady, who said to me: 'The suffering Chinese people have been liberated!' When she said this, she shed kind tears." Li Landing added: "Due to the influence of the great victory of the Chinese People's Liberation Army, everything Chinese aroused great interest among the Hungarian women. When they saw us, they carefully looked at and touched the clothes, shoes, wallets, etc. we were wearing, and expressed great kindness and satisfaction." Li Landing said with emotion: "The friendship between the Chinese and Hungarian people has been linked for the first time!" She recalled a story from when they first entered Hungary: "That day, because we missed the train, we were taken to the home of a female postmaster, who invited all the famous people in the village to play with us. Although we could only use gestures to communicate with each other, we still sang and gathered very harmoniously. The host specially prepared rice, beef, chili peppers, etc. for us to eat. In this home where language was a barrier, we actually spent the whole night happily."

When they talked about the organization of this conference, they all praised it unanimously. Yes, as the host, the Hungarian Women's Association, the task of receiving these three or four hundred guests of fifty different nationalities, different languages, and different habits was indeed not a simple and easy task. However, the Hungarian Women's Association did it, and did it very well, in just one month of preparation. Tang Guifen said: "This alone can also illustrate the strength of the Hungarian women's organization after liberation." On the night of the opening of the conference, the capital organized a torchlight procession and mass rally of 100,000 women. Within a day after the closing of the conference, fifty mass rallies were held simultaneously across the country to welcome delegates from various countries to attend speeches and present large quantities of flowers and gifts. In addition, the Hungarian government organized banquets, dances, operas, and other evening parties for the representatives, and immediately made the conference activities into films for screening. Of the more than 600 people who participated in the conference affairs, the vast majority were women, including 250 female guards and more than 70 female translators. Li Landing said: "Elizabeth, who received us in our guest house, impressed me the most. In addition to doing translation work for us, she took care of all our affairs, big and small, and often stayed up late to work for us. I said to her: "You are too tired!" She replied with a smile: "No, I can come to receive the representatives of your fighting China, and others think it is my happiness and envy it!"

Zhang Qinqiu said: "The Hungarian people expressed great friendship to the representatives of various countries attending the conference, especially to the representatives of the Soviet Union, they expressed lofty respect. This is because they were liberated with the help of the Soviet Red Army, and obtained peace and prosperity." Now Hungary is stepping up the construction of a new democratic country, and is working hard to complete the final year of the three-year plan. After the completion of this three-year plan, the lives of the Hungarian people can be restored and exceed the pre-war level. Finally, Zhang Qinqiu specifically asked the reporter to spread the following sentence to Hungary: "On behalf of our delegation, I would like to express our deep gratitude to the Hungarian women and the Hungarian people, and wish them success in their construction!"

　　在世界妇女第二次代表大会上的中国妇女代表团
    ——张琴秋、汤桂芬、李蓝丁访问记
    出席国际民主妇女联合会召开的第二次世界妇女代表大会的中国妇女代表团从布达佩斯归来了，记者向代表团的张琴秋、汤桂芬、李蓝丁作了一次访问。她们兴奋而愉快地向记者畅谈了这次大会的情形，一致盛赞这是一个成功的会议。
    张琴秋说：“这次大会是世界民主妇女空前大团结的会议，它充分地表现出三年来国际民主妇女阵营的迅速地扩大增强。国际民主妇联的会员国已由三年前的三十三个增加到了现在的五十六个，拥有八千万以上的会员。尽管有些国家的反动政府曾多方阻挠，但是仍然有四十个国家、代表五十种民族的妇女团体派出了三百八十五个代表出席大会。这些代表中包括政治家、科学家、文学家、文艺家、艺术家和各种工作者。尤其是苏联代表团的阵容最为壮观，它是三十八个代表组成的，除了政治家、科学家、文学家、音乐家等以外，还包括各种劳动英雄和模范。出席大会的代表之中，有不少人是经过很多斗争才到达大会的。如自由希腊的十几个戎装代表竟然冲破了反动政府的封锁，徒步走到布达佩斯。我们中国代表团中的汤桂芬和李文宜，也是冲破了国民党反动政府的封锁才得出席大会的。这些都说明世界民主妇女团结的空前加强。”大会于听取了意大利代表罗西夫人关于妇女在争取和平、民主斗争中的任务之报告以后，一致热烈地通过了“保卫和平”的宣言，这对于今后团结国际民主妇女阻止新的法西斯战争与保卫和平将会起很大的作用，同时对于整个世界民主运动也将是一个极大的推动。大会严正地谴责了新战争的挑拨者，揭露了美英等帝国主义准备新战争所进行的阴谋活动，并抗议希腊反动政府和西班牙佛朗哥的血腥恐怖。大会同时表示出对于世界和平堡垒苏联及其领袖斯大林的无比热爱和拥护，对于正在为自由和平而战的中国人民解放军、中国人民及其领袖毛泽东的敬佩与尊重，对于正在进行艰苦斗争的希腊、西班牙、越南、印尼等国人民战争的鼓励与声援。张琴秋同志兴奋地说：“在大会上，苏联的代表发言时，经常受到全体代表的起立致敬，她们高呼‘斯大林万岁’。当我们的代表报告中国人民解放军解放了济南、沈阳、向平津挺进等的每一个胜利时，都激起不断的掌声和‘毛泽东万岁’的连续的欢呼。”她举出下面这个场面来说明大会对于保卫和平所表现的坚强意志。当大会通过宣言时，全体起立，掌声雷动，各国代表和数百来宾高唱自己的国歌或鼓舞斗争的歌曲。“保卫世界和平！”“反对新的帝国主义战争！”“拥护斯大林！”等响亮的口号象波涛席卷全场，彩纸丝象雪片满厅飞舞，代表们特别是主席团、苏联和我们中国代表们的身上都落满五彩缤纷的纸屑和纸条，引起了全场的欢笑。代表们高声欢呼“戈尼金·戈登！”“尼娜·波波娃！”“蔡畅！”经久不息。（按：戈登为国际民主妇联主席，波波娃、蔡畅为副主席）
    汤桂芬和李蓝丁感情洋溢地向记者叙述代表团所受到的热爱与尊重。汤桂芬说：“在群众大会上，我们经常被人们包围起来，从四面八方来的握手、抱吻、照像、询问、赠送礼物和签名的要求，使你简直忙得应付不过来。在群众大会上，当献花、献礼的妇女儿童走向讲台时，下面群众就要高呼‘苏联！’‘中国！’意思是说明她们的礼物首先要赠送给苏联和中国的代表。在一个群众大会上，匈牙利的农妇把她们自己养的鸽子送给苏联代表，表示苏联是和平的保卫者；把小肥猪送给我们的代表，祝福我国人民在解放战争胜利以后，能够享受生活的幸福。”汤桂芬又说：“在一个群众联欢会上，我被一个老太太抱着，她对我说：‘苦难的中国人民得到解放了！’她说这句话的时候，流下了慈祥的眼泪。”李蓝丁补充着说：“由于中国人民解放军的伟大胜利的影响，所以凡是中国的东西都引起匈牙利妇女群众很大的兴趣。她们看到我们的时候连我们身上穿的衣服、鞋子，手里拿的皮夹子等等，都要仔细地看一看，摸一摸，并且表现出非常的亲切和满意。”李蓝丁感动地说：“中、匈两国人民的友谊第一次被连结起来了！”她回忆到她们刚刚进入匈牙利边境时的一个故事说：“那天，因为误了车，我们被接到了一个女邮政局长家里，她把全村有名的人们都找了来陪我们玩，虽然彼此之间还只能用比手势来代替语言，但是仍然是非常融洽地唱歌和欢聚。主人并特别为我们作大米饭、牛肉、辣子等请我们吃。在这个不通语言的主人家里，我们竟然欢渡了一个通宵。”
    她们谈到此次大会的组织工作时。都异口同声地赞叹不已，是的，作为主人的匈牙利妇女会，对于这三四百个包括五十种不同民族，不同语言，不同习惯的客人的招待工作真不是一件简单容易的事情。然而匈牙利妇女会只在短短的一个月筹备工作中作到了，而且作得很好。汤桂芬说：“只是这一点也可以说明获得解放后的匈牙利妇女组织的力量之强大。”在大会开幕的那天晚上匈京组织了十万妇女的火炬游行和群众大会，在大会闭幕后的一天以内全国各地同时举行了五十个群众大会，分别欢迎各国代表出席讲演，并赠送了大批鲜花和礼物。此外，匈牙利政府又为代表们组织了宴会、舞会、歌剧等晚会，并将大会活动立即制成影片放映。参加大会事务工作的六百多人中，绝大部分是妇女，其中包括二百五十名女警卫人员，七十几名女翻译。李蓝丁说：“在我们族馆里招待我们的伊利沙白最使我感动，她除了给我们作翻译工作以外，我们的大事、小事她全要料理，常常深夜不睡为我们忙碌。我对她说：“你太辛苦了！”她却笑着回答我说：“不，我能够来招待你们战斗的中国的代表，别人都以为是我的幸福而引为羡慕呢！”
    张琴秋说：“匈牙利人民对出席大会的各国代表表示了极大的友谊，特别是对苏联的代表表示了崇高的敬意。这是由于他们在苏联红军帮助下获得了解放，获得了和平与繁荣的原故。”现在匈牙利正在加紧新民主主义的国家建设，正在为完成三年计划的最后一年而努力，这个三年计划完成以后，匈牙利人民的生活就可以恢复并超过战前水平。最后张琴秋特别要记者把下面这句话传播到匈牙利去：“我代表我们的代表团向匈牙利妇女、匈牙利人民表示深深的谢意，并遥祝他们建设的成功！”
