To the Yu County People's Government and all the fathers, elders, uncles, brothers, and sisters of the entire county:

    Happy New Year to you! We are following the troops on expeditions to the east and west, realizing the great victory of liberating North China. We will take a further step to carry the revolution through to the end, resolutely, decisively, and thoroughly eliminate the Kuomintang reactionaries, capture alive war criminals such as Chiang Kai-shek, Li Zongren, and Bai Chongxi, eliminate harm for the people, and build a new democratic country.

    Without roots, there would be no branches and leaves. We rely entirely on your hard work and sweat, actively supporting the front. Your strength is powerful!

    We, the thirty-five comrades from Yu County in the entire Second Battalion, propose a competition with you: We are willing to bring honor to the entire county, working hard to kill the enemy at the front. We will never be revolutionary soldiers who give up halfway. We hope that you will work hard in the rear to produce. In the future, we will comment in the People's Daily to see whose achievements are better! With best regards! And wishing you good health and smooth work!

    Representatives of the soldiers from Yu County, Second Battalion, Regiment of a certain unit of the North China People's Liberation Army: Wang Ruisheng, Zheng Shiqin, Liang Shucai, Wan Lianzhou, Zhou Yanle, Lü Shiqing, Zhang Minyuan, Yin Xinguo, Li Binguo, Dai Guangren, Zhang Jianhua, Zhang Runyue, Zhang Zaikui, Tan Furong.
