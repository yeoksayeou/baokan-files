Investigation of Oil and Flour Mills in the Taiyue District
Taiyue Branch of Xinhua News Agency

Oil Mill Issues: According to statistics from seventeen counties in the entire district, there are over 690,000 mu of land producing oilseeds, with an annual output of approximately 215,400 shi of oilseeds, plus over 8 million jin of sunflower seeds. Assuming each pressing requires 2.1 shi of seeds or 200 jin of sunflower seeds, a total of over 2,000 oil mills are needed. However, currently, there are only 802 oil mills in the entire district, requiring an additional 1,200+ oil mills. Except for Qin County, which already has 120 mills, and Changzi, which has 96 mills (enough for oil extraction), other counties are severely lacking and should be greatly developed. If all the produced oilseeds are pressed into oil, it could yield over 5,632,000 jin of oil. If walnut kernels, wild peach kernels, wild apricot kernels, peppercorn seeds, sesame, and other oilseeds are also included, there will be a surplus beyond meeting the needs of the entire district, which can be sold to other regions to increase income. For example, Qin County sells a large quantity of oil to counties along the Tongpu Railway, significantly increasing income. In addition, over 2,689,000 oil cakes can be produced. With an average of four cakes per mu, this can fertilize over 670,000 mu of land, accounting for 7.64% of the district's total land area. However, two issues urgently need to be resolved: First, a lack of funds: After the devastation by the Japanese and puppet regimes, furniture was destroyed, and funds are scarce. The government must provide appropriate support. Various localities have already started providing support, but it still needs to be carried out in a planned and organized manner. In particular, it is necessary to mobilize the masses to raise funds themselves for recovery, as this will create greater strength and faster recovery. Second, there are issues with raw material supply and oil sales: Due to inconvenient transportation, raw material supply is sometimes insufficient, and sometimes the oil cannot be sold, which affects the fluctuating raw material and oil prices. This also urgently needs to be resolved.

Flour Mills: Rural areas generally use noodles and bean sheets during the New Year and festivals. Especially Jincheng, Yangcheng, and Gaoping counties are the largest markets for noodles and bean sheets. The masses in Tunliu and Changzi have a habit of eating noodle flour. Now, after the land reform, poor people own their land and have had a good harvest, their living standards have generally improved, and they need more noodles and bean sheets. Therefore, in some counties, flour mills have greatly developed. According to statistics from Qin County, Tunliu, Changzi, Anze, Qinshui, Yicheng, Jincheng, Yangcheng, and Gaoping counties, there are currently 693 flour mills. In the future, 369 flour mills should be gradually developed based on this. Because the development of flour mills can develop sideline businesses and increase agricultural production (generally, flour mills raise pigs, which can produce a lot of fertilizer for the land). The development of flour mills does not require much government support, and the masses themselves have the power to do it.

　　太岳区油坊粉坊调查
    太岳分社
    油坊问题：据全区十七县统计，出产油籽的地亩有六十九万多亩，年产油籽约为二十一万五千四百多石，另产花籽八百多万斤。如以每榨用籽两石一斗、或二百斤花籽计算，共需两千多座油坊。但目前全区仅有八百零二座油坊，尚需增加油坊一千二百多座。除沁县已有一百二十座，长子有九十六座，足够榨油外，其他各县都缺得很多，应当大大发展。如把所产油籽榨成油，即可产油五百六十三万二千多斤。如再把核桃、山桃仁、山杏仁、花椒子、胡麻等油籽计算在内，除解决全区食用外，尚有剩余，能往外区推销，以增加收入。如沁县的油大量往同蒲沿线各县推销，增加很大一批收入。此外，还能产油饼二百六十八万九千多个。每亩以四个计，可上地六十七万多亩，占全区土地总亩数的百分之七点六四。但目前急需解决两个问题：一是缺少资金：经过日伪摧残，家具毁坏，资金缺乏，政府必须适当的加以扶植。现各地也已开始扶植，但还需有计划有组织的进行。特别是要发动群众自己集资恢复，这样力量更大，恢复更快。其次是原料供应与油的销路问题：因交通不便，原料供应不上，有时油又销不出去，以至影响到原料与油价的忽涨忽跌，这也急须解决。
    粉坊：农村一般过年过节，都用粉条粉皮：特别是晋城、阳城、高平三县，是粉货最大的销地。屯留、长子群众素有吃粉面习惯；现在贫民经过土地改革，自己有了土地，又加丰收，生活水平普遍提高，所需粉货亦较多。所以在某些县里，粉坊已有很大发展。据沁县、屯留、长子、安泽、沁水、翼城、晋城、阳城、高平九县统计，现有粉坊六百九十三座，今后应在此基础上逐渐发展粉坊三百六十九座。因为粉坊的发展，一面可发展副业，一面可增加农业生产（一般粉坊，均养猪可弄很多肥料土地）。而粉坊的发展，亦不需政府怎样扶植，群众自己就有力量搞出来。
