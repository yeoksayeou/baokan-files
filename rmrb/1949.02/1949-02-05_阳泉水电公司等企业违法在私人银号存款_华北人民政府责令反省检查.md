　　Yangquan Hydropower Company and Other Enterprises Illegally Deposited Funds in Private Banks
    North China People's Government Orders Self-Reflection and Inspection
    [This Newspaper] News: On January 24th, the North China People's Government issued a notice to all directly affiliated agencies, administrative offices, directly governed municipal governments, the Xiyang County government, and North China-level agencies regarding the illegal deposit of funds in private banks by enterprise units such as the Yangquan City Hydropower Company. The notice stated in brief: According to the order issued on July 28th of last year by the former Jin-Ji-Lu-Yu Border Region Government and the Jin-Cha-Ji Border Region Administrative Committee, all levels of government agencies and public enterprises must deposit idle public funds in state-owned banks. It is strictly forbidden to deposit public funds in private banks. On January 7th, when Yangquan City, in coordination with the Yangquan Office of the People's Bank of China, inspected the Yisheng Bank (a private bank) in Yangquan City, it was discovered that six companies (all public enterprises) still had public funds deposited in the Yisheng Bank: the Hydropower Company with 578,440 yuan, Yuanxing General Store with 20,400 yuan, the Real Estate Management Office with 32 yuan, the Railway Cooperative with 23,250 yuan, the Xiyang County Cooperative with 40 yuan, and the Jindong Distillery with 33,693 yuan, for a total of 653,855 yuan (all in People's Currency). After investigation, the deposits of the six companies were withdrawn and placed in the custody of the Yangquan Office of the People's Bank of China. In addition, the bank's records revealed that since August of last year, there had been large amounts of repeated deposits and withdrawals by three companies: the Trade Company, Baoxingheng, and the Transportation Company. The Trade Company deposited 1,222,863,500 yuan in border currency (already withdrawn), the Transportation Company deposited 200,033,500 yuan (already withdrawn), and Baoxingheng deposited 480,260 yuan (People's Currency, already withdrawn). In particular, the funds of the Hydropower Company and Baoxingheng were originally deposited in the office of the People's Bank of China, but were later withdrawn and deposited in Yisheng Bank. Regarding the above deposits, considering that this was a first offense, lenient treatment may be granted and confiscation waived, but the departments concerned must submit a report of self-reflection and inspection to the North China People's Government. Although the deposits of Yangquan Trade Company, Baoxingheng, and the Transportation Company have already been withdrawn, the act of depositing funds in a private bank, after the July 28th order of the former Jin-Cha-Ji and Jin-Ji-Lu-Yu border governments, has also led to the order for them to make a written inspection. It is hoped that all government agencies and departments will thoroughly educate and strictly discipline their subordinates in the future to ensure strict compliance with government laws and regulations and to prevent any further violations!

　　阳泉水电公司等企业违法在私人银号存款
    华北人民政府责令反省检查
    【本报讯】华北人民政府一月二十四日为阳泉市水电公司等企业单位违法在私人银号存款事通知各直属机关、各行署、直辖市府、昔阳县府与华北级各机关，略称：根据去年七月二十八日前晋冀鲁豫边区政府晋察冀边区行政委员会通令，各级政府机关、各公营企业闲散公款一律存入国家银行，严禁公款向私人银号存放的规定，阳泉市于一月七日协同中国人民银行阳泉办事处到阳泉市益生银号（私人银号）检查时，发现有水电公司等六家（皆公营事业）仍将公款存入该益生银号：计有水电公司存入五十七万八千四百四十元，元兴总店二万零四百元，房产管理处三十二元，铁路合作社二万三千二百五十元，昔阳县联社四十元，晋东酒栈三万三千六百九十三元，共计总额六十五万三千八百五十五元（均系人民券）。经查出后，即将该六家存款按数提出，由中国人民银行阳泉办事处保管。另外由该号帐内查出自去年八月份起，注有贸易公司、宝兴亨、交通公司等三家亦有大批屡存屡取之款项在内。计有贸易公司存入边钞一十二亿二千二百八十六万三千五百元（已支），交通公司存入二亿零零三十三万五千元（已支），宝兴亨存入四十八万零二百六十元（人民券、已支）。特别是水电公司及宝兴亨之款，原系存在中国人民银行办事处，后又提出而存放于益生银号。对以上存款，姑念初犯，可酌情从宽处理，免予没收，但各该部门须做反省检查报告华北人民政府。至阳泉贸易公司、宝兴亨、交通公司三户存款虽已提完，但存款于私人银号，系在三十七年七月二十八日前晋察冀、晋冀鲁豫两边府通令之后，亦已责令同样做书面检查。希各机关部门今后对所属务须深入教育，严加约束，切实遵守政府法令，勿再违犯！
