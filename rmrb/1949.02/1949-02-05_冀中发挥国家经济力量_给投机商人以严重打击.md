Jizhong Brings National Economic Power into Play to Severely打击 Speculative Merchants

[Jizhong Electric] The Yuanxing General Store of Jizhong Trading Company (located in Anguo) has basically completed its work of stabilizing prices, guaranteeing mass production and supply, and giving a severe打击 to speculative merchants. According to statistics from the five markets in Anguo from December 6th to 21st last year, grain prices once rose by 82%, and homespun cloth rose by 44%, greatly affecting textile production. A weaver in Nangu City said: "On the 6th, each bolt of cloth could be exchanged for 46 catties of millet, but on the 21st, it could only be exchanged for 37 catties." In order to support mass production and protect the interests of the people, the Yuanxing General Store, in coordination with various economic departments, took steps to stabilize prices. On the one hand, they went deep into the markets to listen to the opinions of the masses, and on the other hand, they investigated the attitudes of private merchants, and promptly introduced market conditions in various places, so that the tricks of private merchants could not deceive the people. The Yuanxing store also sold 52,080 catties of wheat and 65,523 catties of coarse grains in the markets on the 26th and 28th. As a result, the price of wheat fell from 175,000 yuan per斗 to 135,000 yuan, and the Yuanxing store's selling price fell to 128,000 yuan; the price of millet fell from 135,000 yuan per斗 to 100,000 yuan, and the Yuanxing store's selling price fell from 120,000 yuan to 98,000 yuan, and prices tended to stabilize. The masses were very happy every time the store announced a drop in grain prices. Some said, "If the public hadn't sold grain to lower the price, we wouldn't even be able to afford dumplings for the New Year." The stabilization of grain prices crushed the hoarding and speculation of speculative merchants. For example, Fushunhe, which originally dealt in hardware, also bought more than 1,500 catties of millet when grain prices rose, hoarding it in preparation for making money. After the grain price fell, they were afraid of losing more money, so they sold the millet at a loss. He said: I will never do speculative trading again. A merchant in Hou Village saw that the store sold wheat at 150,000 yuan per斗, which was 25,000 yuan cheaper than the market price, so he bought one石. When the price of wheat fell to 130,000 yuan, he was afraid that it would fall further, so he had to sell it at a loss of 200,000 yuan.

　　冀中发挥国家经济力量
    给投机商人以严重打击
    【冀中电】冀中贸易公司元兴总店（住安国）稳定物价工作基本上胜利完成，保障了群众生产与供给，给投机商人以严重打击。安国五个集市去年十二月六日至二十一日统计，粮价曾上涨百分之八十二，土布上涨百分之四十四，纺织品生产大受影响。南固城的织布户说：六号集上每匹布换小米四十六斤，二十一号只换三十七斤。元兴总店为了扶植群众生产，保障人民的利益，与各经济部门统一步骤，进行稳定物价工作，一面深入集市听取群众反映，一面调查私商的态度，及时介绍各地行情，使私商的捣鬼花样不能蒙蔽人民。元兴商店并在二十六、二十八两集出售小麦五万二千零八十斤，粗粮六万五千五百二十三斤，因之小麦由每斗十七万五千元回落至十三万五千元，元兴号售价降至十二万八千元；小米价格由每斗十三万五千元落到十万元，元兴商店售价由十二万元落到九万八千元，物价乃趋向稳定。群众在每次商店宣布粮食落价时，都非常欢迎，有的说：“要不是公家卖粮食压低粮价，过年连顿饺子也吃不上。”粮价的稳定，打垮了投机商人的囤积居奇，例如福顺和号本来经营铁货，趁粮价上涨时也买小米一千五百多斤，囤积起来，准备赚钱，在粮价下落之后，他们怕赔钱更多，就赔钱把小米卖出去，他说：再也不做投机买卖了。候村某商人见商店以每斗十五万元卖出小麦，比市价便宜二万五千元就买了一石，等到小麦落到十三万元时，他害怕还要落，只好赔二十万元卖出。
