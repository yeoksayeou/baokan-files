A Worker's Words
    Hu Weixin
     I am the son of a clothing maker,
     I am from the oppressed class.
     The old society,
     Was the world of wealthy capitalists:
     They looked down on us poor people as worthless,
     Simply the cattle and horses of the rich,
     Tools that could talk.
   　☆　☆　☆
     My father had great skill,
     But earned nothing,
     Benefitting the capitalists.
     Later, my father died and my mother remarried,
     Life became even more impossible,
     People even said I was “destined to be this way,”
     “A poor nest can’t produce a rich baby.”
     “When will I ever stand tall…”,
     I didn’t dare to utter this thought,
     In the old society, how could we ever hold our heads high,
     Where would poor people have any say?
　   ☆　☆　☆
     Since joining the revolutionary factory,
     I have found my home,
     And met my parents – the Communist Party.
     I put on worker's clothes,
     I took off my ragged clothes,
     Brushed away the dirty, tangled hair,
     And revealed a human appearance.
     Here there is democracy and no exploitation,
     There is mutual help and no jealousy,
     The master teaches the apprentice with all his heart,
     The apprentice sincerely loves the master.
　   ☆　☆　☆
     When I first came, I was pitifully "foolish,"
     I had no skills whatsoever,
     The Party nurtured me,
     Educated me,
     And never minded the trouble.
     They taught me skills, taught me to read and write,
     And said: "Don't miss your home, work hard,
     Become a hero in the future!"
     The factory is my home.
     What else do I want?
     I have grown up in the factory for more than ten years.
　   ☆　☆　☆
     A tree branch can never forget its roots,
     The Communist Party raised me,
     I will never forget it!
     I will always remember it in my heart!
     I will work hard to produce,
     Support the front lines,
     Wipe out the Chiang bandits completely,
     And let all the worker brothers and sisters across the country see the clear sky.

　　一个工人的话
    胡维新
     我是一个被服匠的儿子，
     我是被压迫的阶级。
     旧社会，
     是老财资本家的天下：
     看咱穷人一钱不值，
     简直是有钱人的牛马，
     会说话的工具。
   　☆　☆　☆
     爹爹一身好技术，
     啥也没挣下，
     便宜了资本家。
     后来，爹死娘嫁人，
     生活更无法，
     人家还说我“命里活该”，
     “穷窝里生不出富娃娃”。
     “我啥时候也争口气……”，
     有这个思想可不敢提，
     旧社会里咱哪能扬眉吐气，
     哪有穷人说话的余地。
　   ☆　☆　☆
     我自从参加了革命工厂，
     才找到了自己的家乡，
     见到了爹娘——共产党。
     我穿上工人服，
     我脱下破衣裳，
     推去污垢的乱发，
     露出了人模样。
     这里有民主没有剥削，
     有互助没有忌妒，
     师傅真心教学员，
     学员诚意爱师傅。
　   ☆　☆　☆
     我刚来时“傻”的可怜，
     什么本领也没有，
     党培养我，
     教育我，
     从来没嫌过麻烦。
     教我技术，教我写算，
     还说：“别想家，好好干，
     将来当个英雄汉！”
     工厂就是我的家。
     我还想啥？
     十几年来我在工厂长大。
　   ☆　☆　☆
     树枝儿长大忘不了根，
     共产党抚养我长大，
     我忘不了呀！
     我要永远记在心！
     我要努力生产，
     支援前线，
     把蒋匪消灭完，
     叫全国工人兄弟见青天。
