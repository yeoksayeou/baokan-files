Dear Northeastern and Northern China Commanders and Fighters:

　　How have you been recently? Happy New Year! Because of your heroic tenacity, your fearlessness in sacrificing your own lives, and your tireless day and night efforts to strike the enemy with your own flesh and blood in that frozen and snowy land, you have recovered the Northeast and liberated countless fathers, elders, brothers, and sisters in the Northeast who have been ravaged by the iron hooves of the Japanese devils and the Chiang bandits for so many years. At the same time, you have accelerated the early arrival of our national victory and fundamentally collapsed Chiang Kai-shek's military and political situation. It seems that Chiang Kai-shek is about to be defeated. This great and amazing victory cry quickly spread throughout the country. We also heard that you had captured Beiping and Tianjin despite any fatigue. When we heard this news, we were immediately thrilled and inspired, and we were extremely happy, which filled us with even more confidence in the rapid liberation of Peiping and Tianjin.

　　Comrades! You are the iron heroes of the Chinese nation. Your achievements are engraved in everyone's minds. Your spirit of not fearing hardship and fighting tenaciously for human liberation will be passed down for eternity and cannot be extinguished. We in the rear are very ashamed. We have nothing to repay you, so we just pay you our sincere respects and wish you good health. Finally, I hope you will fight the enemy with peace of mind and steadfastness, and don't worry about your families. There is land to cultivate at home, and our government is taking care of it, so there are no difficulties. Brothers! Hold your guns tightly at the front and aim at the enemy's head; we will use your fighting spirit to study, and use our pens to strike the enemy's chest. The people in the rear are actively producing to support you. Dear brothers, work hard, and let's work together with the front and rear to achieve national victory soon. At that time, we will reunite and live a peaceful life together.

　　I wish you good health and that you kill more enemies!

　　　　　Little Sister Li Yingrui from the Military Supply School

  　要瞄准敌人的脑袋！亲爱的东北华北指战员大哥们：
    近来你们的精神愉快吧？过年好吗？由于你们的英勇顽强，不怕牺牲自己的生命，昼夜不停息的在那冰天雪地里用自己的血肉打击敌人，收复了东北，把东北那被日本鬼子和蒋贼铁蹄蹂躏了多少年的无数的父老兄妹们解放出来。同时，更加速了咱全国胜利的早日来临，使蒋匪介石的军事、政治从根本上崩溃。眼看就要打败蒋介石了，这样伟大惊人的胜利呼声，很快就传遍了各地。又听到你们不顾任何疲劳打下了北平天津。我们听到这个消息，顿时欢腾鼓舞，万分高兴，使我们更充满了很快解放平津的信心。
    同志们！你们是中华民族钢铁的英雄男儿汉，你们的功绩刻在每个人的脑海里。你们不怕艰苦，顽强的为人类解放而奋斗的精神是万载流传不可灭掉的。我们在后方是非常的惭愧，无什么可以报答你们，只是向你们致亲切的敬礼，祝你们身体健康。最后希望你们安心踏实的向敌人斗争，不要挂念家庭，家里有地种啦，又有咱政府照顾，是没有困难的。大哥们！你们在前方握紧枪杆，要瞄准敌人的脑袋；我们用你们战斗的那股精神来学习，用我们的笔杆去打击敌人的胸膛。我们后方人们都在积极生产，支援你们。亲爱的哥哥们，你们努力吧，咱前后方配合起来加油干，全国胜利很快就完成，那时，咱们团聚在一起安安乐乐的过日子。
    祝你们身体强壮，多杀敌人！
