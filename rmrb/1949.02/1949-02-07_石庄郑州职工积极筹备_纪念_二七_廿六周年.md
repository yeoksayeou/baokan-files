　　[Shijiazhuang News] The preparatory committee for the 26th anniversary of the "February 7th" Incident held its first meeting on January 30th, resolving to widely publicize the significance of the "February 7th" Incident through various means and, in conjunction with the current situation, expose the enemy's false peace conspiracy and carry the revolution through to the end.

Veteran workers who participated in the "February 7th" Incident will be invited to give speeches; a worker conference will be held in Shijiazhuang City, where veteran workers will report on the history of "February 7th," and various forms of propaganda meetings or mass rallies, as well as parades and demonstrations, will be held.
　　
　　Xinhua News Agency, Zhengzhou, 3rd: Workers from all walks of life in Zhengzhou, the birthplace of the "February 7th" workers' movement, are actively preparing to commemorate this great festival of the Chinese working class, which is about to arrive, and to further develop the workers' movement in the Central Plains Liberated Area. The Zhengzhou Municipal "February 7th" Commemoration Preparatory Committee was formally established at a symposium of worker representatives from various industries held on the 25th of last month, composed of 25 representatives from the municipal Federation of Trade Unions preparatory committee, the Longhai-Pinghan Railway Workers' Union preparatory committee, and postal, telecommunications, and other departments. There are still many veteran workers in Zhengzhou who participated in the strike at that time, as well as family members of the martyred, who have not forgotten this heroic, bloody day. Now, the workers with the glorious tradition of "February 7th" are commemorating their own great festival for the first time after liberation, and they are particularly aware of the importance of their responsibility and have many things to do. The Zhengzhou "February 7th" Preparatory Committee has decided on many preparatory tasks for the commemoration of "February 7th," the main items of which are: (1) To hold a symposium of veteran workers who participated in the "February 7th" strike, to search for the course of the "February 7th" strike and struggle materials, in order to educate our own ranks; (2) To organize an investigation and visiting group to investigate the living conditions of veteran workers who participated in the "February 7th" strike and the families of the martyrs, and prepare to give them spiritual commendation and material comfort; (3) Workers from various enterprises, industries, and factories will hold "February 7th" commemoration meetings or various symposiums, linking them with the current situation to publicize the significance of commemorating "February 7th," and discuss the current tasks of the working class; (4) To designate February 1st to 7th as Propaganda Week, organize propaganda teams, and mobilize workers from various industries and factories to prepare cultural programs and torchlight parades to conduct street propaganda. In addition, Zhengzhou is also preparing to hold a symposium of trade union representatives from various regions on February 7th to discuss the establishment of the Central Plains Federation of Trade Unions and formulate the direction of the Central Plains workers' movement. To this end, the Zhengzhou Workers' Symposium has issued a telegram inviting the preparatory committees of the trade unions in Kaifeng, Luoyang, Xuchang, Liaohe, Shangqiu, Nanyang, Zhoujiakou, and other cities to each select ten representatives to come to Zhengzhou on February 7th to participate in the meeting.
