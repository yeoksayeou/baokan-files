　　Enterprise Financial Departments' Expenditures Must Follow Regulations
  　Private Use of Public Funds Strictly Prohibited
    North China Government Issues Order for Thorough Inspection and Implementation
    [Reported by this newspaper] The North China People's Government issued an order on February 1st to all public enterprises and financial supply agencies, stating that the handling of property must be based on regulations. It is strictly forbidden for individuals to borrow money, donate funds to any organization or individual, or misappropriate public funds for production investment, lending, or other profit-making ventures. The order is as follows:
    All properties of public factories, stores, banks, railways, transportation companies, warehouses, and financial supply agencies are public property. The handling of these properties must be based on regulations, and no expenditures or spending outside of the regulations are permitted. Recently, it has been found that some public enterprises are arbitrarily using public funds to donate to others or misappropriate public funds. This behavior is essentially a form of corruption. To overcome this behavior, it is hereby decided:
    1. All public enterprises (including factories, banks, stores, railways, transportation companies, etc.) and financial supply agencies are strictly prohibited from donating or giving gifts to any organization or individual. Large amounts of donations already made by public enterprises without the approval of the Financial and Economic Committee in the past will not be reimbursed, and the enterprises will be held responsible for recovering the donated funds.
    2. All public enterprises and financial supply agencies are strictly prohibited from individuals borrowing money, misappropriating public funds to operate cooperative societies or production businesses within their own organizations, or investing in or lending to public or private industrial and commercial enterprises, or engaging in other profit-making ventures.
    3. All management personnel of public enterprises and staff of financial supply agencies are strictly prohibited from engaging in buying and selling in their own name or in the name of the organization. The legitimate operation of production and consumer cooperatives of the personnel of these enterprises and agencies is not restricted.
    4. All public enterprises and financial supply agencies, in addition to expenditures stipulated by regulations, which should be spent according to stipulated procedures, any expenditures outside of the regulations must be approved before they can be used.
    Regarding the above four points, the North China People's Government also ordered all public enterprises and financial supply agencies to conduct thorough inspections in conjunction with the current anti-organizational and undisciplined movement, and to establish a serious style of distinguishing between public and private interests, and being honest and dedicated to public service in the financial departments.

    华北政府训令深入检查执行
    【本报讯】华北人民政府于二月一日训令各公营企业及财政供给机关，对于财物的处理，必须根据制度，一律不准个人借款，不准向任何团体或个人捐赠款项及挪用公款经营生产投资借贷或其他营利事业。其训令如下：
    所有公营的工厂、商店、银行、铁路、运输公司、仓库及财政机关供给机关的财产，均为公家的财产，其财物之处理，必须根据制度，不准作制度以外的开支花费。近查有些公营企业，随便动用公款，捐赠他人，或挪用公款，这种行为，在性质上是一种贪污行为。为克服此种行为，特决定：
    一、所有公营企业（包括工厂、银行、商店、铁路、运输公司等）及财政供给机关，一律不准向任何团体或个人捐款馈赠。过去各公营企业未经财经委员会批准已捐赠的大宗款项，一律不准报帐，责成各企业将所捐赠之款项追回。
    二、所有公营企业及财政供给机关，一律不准个人借款，及挪用公款经营本机关合作社、生产事业，或向公私工商业投资借贷或作其他营利事业。
    三、所有公营企业机关的经营人员及财政供给机关的工作人员，一律不准以个人或机关名义做卖买。各该企业机关人员的机关生产及消费合作社之合法经营不受限制。
    四、所有公营企业及财政供给机关，除制度规定之开支，应依规定手续开支外，制度规定以外之开支，必须请准，才能动用。
    以上四项，华北人民政府并令各公营企业及财政供给机关结合现在反无组织无纪律运动，深入检查，树立财经部门中的公私分清，廉洁奉公的严肃作风。
