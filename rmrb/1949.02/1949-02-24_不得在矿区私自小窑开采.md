　　Private Small-Scale Mining in Mining Areas is Prohibited
Editor's Note: If the situation reflected by the Liuhegou Coal Mine is true, the relevant local government departments should not ignore it and allow it to damage national wealth. They should immediately investigate and take effective measures to stop it.

Comrades Editors:
　　We have something to discuss with you, which is the issue of some people secretly opening small coal mines in state-owned mining areas.
　　Our state-owned mining areas are not allowed to be privately mined, which has been prohibited by the North China People's Government and the Administrative Office. After last autumn, the masses wanted to open small coal mines, and the cadres organized the masses to focus on small coal mines for winter production. This is just a narrow "mass viewpoint," not understanding the seriousness of the damage small coal mines cause to the mining area. Therefore, the incidents of opening small coal mines have continued to occur. After explanation and prevention, some have stopped. However, in November of last year, the Shuiye Production Department of the 52nd Regiment, without implementing the public notice and without approval, privately mined on the south side of the mining area, which caused the masses to start mining again. We have sent letters and personally talked to the relevant county and district governments, but they only said they would stop it without taking action. In particular, we sent three letters to the Anyang County Government, but they not only failed to stop it but did not even reply to the letters, showing indifference and neglect to this matter. We believe that this irresponsible attitude towards the revolution is unacceptable. We cannot stop this matter, and the local government is indifferent and neglects it. Therefore, we are submitting this for your response.
　　The small coal mines currently operating are as follows: The 52nd Regiment is mining in the south of the mine. Dongaikou Village is mining behind Beiling and in front of Lao Jun Temple. Song Jintang is mining in Luoquan＠. Wu Tiancheng is mining behind Beiling. The Guantai District Cooperative has a total of five mines in the Lianhua Mountain area of Cixian County. Wang Fengyu of Shuichi Village, Li Yangzhi of Doutang Village, Li Yingjun and Zhang Xuesheng of Nanlianhua Village, and Liu Xifang of Taizizhai Village are all mining. These are the ones we know about, but it is difficult to say about those who mine secretly at night.

### 不得在矿区私自小窑开采

　　不得在矿区私自小窑开采
    编者按：如果六河沟煤矿反映的这种情况属实的话，当地有关政府部门，绝不应置之不问，任其损害国家财富，亟应立即检查，作有效制止。编辑同志：
    我们有件工作和你谈谈，就是有人在国营矿区偷开小窑问题。
    咱们的国营矿区内是不允许私自开采小窑的，这是华北人民政府和行署通令禁止过的。在去年秋后，群众就想开采小窑，干部组织群众冬季生产，也就以开小窑为生产对象。这只是狭隘的“群众观点”，不了解小窑破坏矿区的严重性，因此开采小窑事件便不断发生，经解释制止后，部分业已停止。但在去年十一月间，五十二团水冶生产部，不执行布告通令，又未经批准便私自在矿区南边开采，因此又引起群众的开采。我们曾给有关县、区政府去信和亲自交谈，他们只说制止而不做，特别是给安阳县府曾三次去信，不但未制止且连信也没答复，对此事漠不关心，置之不理。这种对革命不负责任的态度我们认为是要不得的，这件事我们制止不住，地方政府又漠不关心置之不理，因此提出请答复。
    现在有的小窑列下：五十二团在矿南开采。东艾口村在北岭后和老君庙前开采。宋金堂在罗圈＠开采。吴天成在北岭后开采。观台区联社在磁县莲花山一带共有五座。水池村王凤玉，都堂村李羊只，南莲花村李英俊和张学生，台子寨村柳西方都开采。这是已了解的，但有夜晚偷开的就很难说了。
