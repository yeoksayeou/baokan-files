Criticism and Suggestions

　　Incompetent Teacher in Angou
　　Hope Lingshou Government Investigates
　　To the Editor:
　　Recently, the higher authorities have repeatedly emphasized "educational standardization," requiring that educational work be emphasized in leadership and that teachers improve in quality. However, our area does not pay much attention to educational work. Hu Shuzhen, a teacher in Angou Village, has three children (she was originally a cadre's family member). The state was unable to provide a livelihood, so she went to the county to request help in resolving the difficulties. The county could not think of any other way, so they sent her to teach in the first district to solve her difficulties with the monthly salary paid in grain. However, Hu Shuzhen has a very low level of education and is busy taking care of a baby and two toddlers, unable to manage everything. As a result, the number of students has gradually decreased, thus wasting the learning opportunities of dozens of children for a semester. This has aroused public dissatisfaction. We request that the government investigate and allocate a competent teacher.

　　岸沟教员不称职
  　希望灵寿政府检查一下编辑同志：
    最近上级一再提出“教育正规化”，在领导上要重视教育工作，教员要从质量上提高一步。但我处对教育工作是很不重视的。岸沟村教员胡树珍有三个小孩（本人原系干部家属），国家中生活无办法，即到县要求给解决困难，县里想不出别的办法，就派她到一区教学，以每月所得的薪金米，解决困难。但胡树珍文化程度很低，又抱着一个小孩，带着两个会走的小孩，忙的顾不过来，因之，学生逐渐减少，这样白白把数十名儿童一学期的学习机会耽误了。引起群众不满。要求政府检查一下，配备上能称职的教员。
