Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 13th: TASS Moscow dispatch: The first issue of the 1949 "Trade Union" magazine, which has just been published here, carries a comprehensive report on the development of the world labor movement in 1948.

The report stated: In Eastern Europe, the final elimination of divisions within the labor movement, coupled with the establishment of unified working-class parties, is the greatest factor in consolidating the strength of Eastern and Southeastern European countries. Unified trade unions have also developed greatly. Polish trade union members numbered only one million in 1945, but had increased to three million by October 1948. During the same period, in Czechoslovakia, trade union membership increased from 1.5 million to 2.8 million; in Hungary, from 888,000 to 1.7 million; in Romania, from 1.3 million to 1.4 million; in Bulgaria, from 385,000 to 600,000; and in Albania, from 20,000 to 51,000.

In capitalist countries, the consolidation and active efforts of the progressive democratic camp are manifested in the expanding struggle against monopoly capitalists. Last year, there were many strikes in Western countries. The number of strikes in France was in the thousands, and the number of participants was in the hundreds of thousands. From April to August 1948 alone, there were as many as 500 strikes by metal manufacturing industry workers. From July to September, a total of approximately seven million workers and employees went on strike. However, the biggest event was the two-month general strike held by more than 300,000 French miners in October and November, which triggered a glorious movement of working-class solidarity in mainland France and other countries.

In Italy, as in France, large-scale strikes continued for 18 months, with almost no slackening. The general strike that broke out on July 14, 1948, was a spontaneous protest against the assassination of Italian Communist Party General Secretary Togliatti, with as many as eight million workers and employees participating. This was a major event not only in the strike movement but also in Italian political life.

The strike movement in West Germany also saw a notable increase last year. This began with mass strikes protesting the hunger policy. In February, nearly three million people participated in this strike. The general strike in West Germany reached its peak on November 12, with nine million participants.

The labor movement is on the rise in both India and Japan. According to incomplete figures, India had 926 strikes in the first five months of 1948, with 900,000 participants. In Japan, the number of strikers exceeded 800,000 per month in 1948, bringing the year's total to nearly ten million.

According to official figures, 1.2 million people in the United States were involved in strikes in the first half of 1948. The mood of the American working masses is reflected in the fact that last year, when the vicious movement against all progressive things reached its peak in the United States, the Progressive Party was formed and established its influence in a large section of the working class and its trade union organizations.

For the trade union movement, it is worth noting that the attempts by elements seeking to split the World Federation of Trade Unions (WFTU) to attack the WFTU consistently failed in 1948.

### 一九四八年世界职工运动的发展

　　一九四八年世界职工运动的发展
    【新华社陕北十三日电】塔斯社莫斯科讯：此间刚刚出版的一九四九年第一期“职工会”杂志，刊载了一篇关于一九四八年世界工人运动之发展的综合报导。
    该报导称：在东欧，工人运动中分裂的最后消除，与工人阶级统一政党的建立，是巩固东欧与东南欧各国力量的最大因素。统一的职工会也已大大发展。波兰职工会会员在一九四五年仅为一百万，一九四八年十月已增加到三百万。同一时期，在捷克斯洛伐克，职工会会员已由一百五十万增加到二百八十万；在匈牙利，由八十八万八千增加到一百七十万；在罗马尼亚，由一百三十万增加到一百四十万；在保加利亚，由三十八万五千增加到六十万；在阿尔巴尼亚，由二万增加到五万一千。
    在资本主义国家中，进步民主阵营力量的巩固与积极活动，表现在反对垄断资本家的斗争更加扩大。去年，西方国家中有许多罢工。法国罢工的事件，数以千计，而参加罢工的人数，则以十万计。一九四八年四月到八月，仅只五金制造工业工人罢工的次数，即有五百次之多。由七月到九月期间，总计约有七百万工人与雇员罢工。但是，最大的事件还是三十多万法国矿工在十月、十一月举行的两个月总罢工，这个罢工曾引起法国本部与其他国家中辉煌的工人阶级团结的运动。
    在意大利，也象在法国一样，十八个月来继续着大规模的罢工，几乎没有松懈过。在一九四八年七月十四日爆发的总罢工，是对谋杀意共总书记托格里亚蒂的自发抗议，参加的工人与雇员达八百万人之多。这不仅是罢工运动中而且是意大利政治生活中最重大的事件。
    西德的罢工运动，在去年也有值得注意的增长。这是以抗议饥饿政策的群众性罢工开始的。二月间，参加这个罢工的几达三百万人。十一月十二日西德的总罢工达到了顶点，当时参加者有九百万人。
    劳工运动在印度与日本均在上升中。根据不完全的数字，印度在一九四八年头五个月中，便有九百二十六次罢工，参加者九十万人。在日本，一九四八年每月罢工人数超过了八十万人，这使一年的总数几达一千万人。
    依据官方数字，在一九四八年前半年，美国有一百二十万人卷入了罢工。美国工人大众的情绪，表现在这一事实上，即去年当反对一切进步事物的恶毒运动在美国达到最高峰时，进步党组成了，并且在很大一部分工人阶级及其职工会组织中树立起它的影响。
    对职工会运动来说，值得指出的，是力求分裂世界工联的分子对世界工联所进行的攻击，在一九四八年始终遭受了失败。
