Experiences in Key CYCL Establishment Work in Central Hebei
    Jizhong Branch
    The establishment of the New Democratic Youth League is an arduous and delicate task. Based on the initial experiences gained in key CYCL establishment work in Shenxian, Renhe, and Raoyang counties, here are a few points:

    First, the entire Party must strengthen its leadership over youth work. The Raoyang No. 1 District Party Committee mobilized all cadres to do youth work in the key CYCL establishment work, with the branch as the core and the young Party members as the foundation, absorbing advanced young activists to form a preparatory committee, and mobilizing all Party member cadres to carry out publicity and deliberation, individually absorb members, and introduce Youth League members. Dongxicaolu in this district were all under the active mobilization of Party members, communicating and connecting with young activists; conversely, the Renhe County Nos. 4 and 5 District Party Committees neglected the leadership of youth work and did not achieve much in the CYCL establishment work.

    Second, breaking ideological misgivings and raising awareness is the key to leading CYCL establishment. The main key to leading CYCL establishment lies in publicizing and mobilizing to raise the awareness of young people and breaking the ideological misgivings of the masses. On the one hand, breaking the ideological misgivings of the youth themselves, and on the other hand, breaking the misgivings of parents. According to the experience of CYCL establishment work in various counties, initially, because some young people themselves had low awareness, coupled with the fear of attending meetings and delaying production, it caused great difficulties in the work. At this time, it is necessary to clearly publicize the great tasks of the New Democratic Youth League, and the guiding principles and purposes of CYCL establishment, and carry out vigorous publicity in various forms and methods. Raoyang No. 1 District and Nanzhao Village in Renhe County repeatedly publicized and deliberated at various meetings, blackboard newspapers, and radio stations to dispel the misgivings of parents and themselves. It is also necessary to make the masses aware of the important role of the Youth League from actual work.

    Third, organizing people's schools is a bridge for CYCL establishment. Improving the political culture and awareness of young people through people's schools. Organizing scattered young men and women, and leading them to carry out political and cultural learning, thus laying the foundation for CYCL establishment. First, carry out CYCL establishment education through people's schools. At the beginning, organize study groups first, and then gradually expand the scope of people's schools. After the deliberation matures in cultural learning, it can be proposed that young people should have an advanced activist organization, and then the tasks of the New Democratic Youth League, the obligations of Youth League members, the Youth League Constitution, and the conditions for joining the Youth League, etc., should be explained in detail.

    Fourth, collective education and mobilization, and individual cultivation of backbones. Under general mobilization and calls, cultivating upright activists to take the lead is an important part of CYCL establishment. Zhangtun Village in Shenxian County first cultivated activists who played a pioneering role in various tasks. For example, activist San Ji said at the youth forum: "I strive for the tasks of the League, obey the League Constitution, implement the League's resolutions, and pay League dues on time." Young people all put forward their opinions on joining the League. Then, a CYCL establishment meeting was held to formally establish the Youth League. Cultivating active young teachers is also a good way. Yun Xin, a teacher at Xinxing Road Primary School in Shulu County, has a high prestige among young people. Since he joined the League, the work of the Youth League has made great progress. The Youth Committee of the 13th District Party Committee held a symposium for young activists in two villages. After explaining the League Constitution, nine out of eighteen young people on the spot signed up to join the League. A grand ceremony must be held when establishing the League. Enable League members to deeply accept the League Constitution, clarify the future direction of the Youth League's struggle, improve learning and production enthusiasm, and establish the idea of serving the people. The results of holding such ceremonies in Jiuji Village and Liuzhuang in Raoyang No. 1 District were very significant. Some villages established the Youth League plainly, without grasping the serious entry education, so they could not clearly improve the League members' understanding of the Youth League at the time of joining the League. When organizing League members, it is based on the opinions of the masses and the opinions of League members, generally do not mix men and women. Leaders must pay attention to this issue.

　　冀中重点建团经验
    冀中分社
    新民主主义青年团的建立，是一件艰巨而细腻的工作。根据深县、任河、饶阳等县在重点建团中，获几点初步经验：
    第一、全党必须加强对青年工作的领导。侥阳一区区委，在重点建团工作中动员全体干部做青年工作，以支部为核心，以青年党员为基础，吸收先进的青年积极分子组成筹委会，动员全体党员干部，作宣传酝酿，个别吸收，介绍团员。这区东西草芦，都是在党员的积极发动下，串通联络青年积极分子；相反的，任河县四、五区区委因忽视对青年工作的领导，在建团工作上没得到多大成绩。
    第二、打破思想顾虑提高觉悟是领导建团的关键。领导建团的主要关键，在于宣传动员提高青年的觉悟，打破群众的思想顾虑。一方面打破青年本身的思想顾虑，另一方面打破家长的顾虑。根据各县建团工作的经验，最初因为有些青年本人觉悟低，再加上，有怕开会怕耽误生产的顾虑就造成工作的很大困难。这时必须明确宣传新民主主义青年团的伟大任务，和建团方针目的，采取各种形式和办法大力宣传。侥阳一区、任河南召村，都是在各种不同的会议上，黑板报广播台上，反复的宣传酝酿，才打消了家长和本人的顾虑。并须从实际工作中使群众认识了青年团的重要作用。
    第三、组织民校是建团的一个桥梁。经过民校提高青年的政治文化和觉悟。把散漫的男女青年组织起来，领导他们进行政治文化学习，这样就奠定了建团的基础。首先经过民校进行建团教育。开头先组织学习小组，然后逐渐扩大民校范围。在学习文化中酝酿成熟，即可提出：青年应该有个先进积极分子的组织，然后便详细讲明新民主主义青年团的任务、团员的义务、团章和入团条件等问题。
    第四、集体教育号召，个别培养骨干。在一般动员号召下，培养正派积极分子带头，是建团的重要部分。深县张屯村，先培养了积极分子，在各种工作中起了先锋作用，如积极分子三纪在青年座谈会上说：“我为团的任务奋斗，服从团章，执行团的决议，按期交团费。”青年们都提出入团的意见。接着召开建团大会正式把青年团建立起来。培养积极的青年教员，也是好办法。束鹿新兴路村小学教员云欣，在青年中威信很高，自他入团后，青年团的工作有很大开展十三区区委青委，召开两个村青年积极分子座谈会，讲明团章后，当场十八个青年就有九个报名要求入团。建团时必须举行隆重的入团仪式。使团员深刻的接受团章，明确今后青年团的奋斗方向，提高学习、生产热情，树立为人民服务的思想。饶阳一区九吉村、刘庄，这样举行仪式结果收效很大。有些村平平淡淡的成立了青年团，没有抓紧进行严肃的入团教育，这样就不能在入团时就明确提高团员对青年团的认识。在团员编组时，是根据群众意见，和团员意见，一般不要男女混编。对此问题领导上必须引起注意。
