　　To Facilitate Medical Treatment for the People's Sick Livestock
  　North China University Agricultural College Establishes Veterinary Stations
    [Report from this newspaper] Within the short span of a year and a half, with the assistance of local governments in various regions, North China University Agricultural College rapidly established twenty-four veterinary education and work stations in key transportation hubs. These stations specialize in treating all kinds of ailments in mules, horses, cattle, and donkeys for the masses. Furthermore, each station has organized medical teams that delve into the countryside to treat and prevent livestock diseases for the people. Medicine fees are charged on a semi-commercial basis, with only half the price being charged when treating livestock for the masses. Half of this income is used to cover the expenses of each station and to develop new stations. Since their establishment, a total of 31,132 mules, horses, cattle, and donkeys have been treated. Simultaneously, 162 students have been trained, and over 60 students have already returned to their original locations. At the veterinary station on Huomo Street in Handan alone, eight or nine livestock were treated daily during the summer months. Over the past six months, 1,858 sick livestock have been successfully treated. The veterinary stations in Taiyue and Taiyue also receive many livestock for treatment every day. Not only have the students learned skills during their internships, but the masses also say, "There is now a guarantee when livestock get sick." People from the countryside frequently come to the veterinary education stations to request to learn veterinary medicine. In about six months, they can learn to diagnose and treat diseases. Once local students from various regions master medical skills, the entire veterinary station is handed over to the direct control of the masses (with the approval of the local government). It is estimated that over ten veterinary stations are planned to be handed over to the masses this year, and will be handed over after government approval, with new stations being established elsewhere.

　　为便利群众医治病牲口
  　华大农学院增设兽医站
    【本报讯】在一年半的短短时间内，华北大学农学院得到各地地方政府的协助，很快的在各交通要地成立了二十四个兽医教育工作站，专门为群众治骡、马、牛、驴一切杂症。又由各站组织了医疗队，深入农村为群众治防家畜病疫，医药费采取半营业性质，给群众医治牲口时，只收半价，以此半数之收入，作为各站之开支，及发展新站之用。自设立以来，共治了骡、马、牛、驴三万一千一百三十二头。同时，还训练出学员一百六十二名，已有六十余名学生返回原地。单在邯郸火磨街的兽医站，夏天每天治牲口八、九头，六个月来已医治好一千八百五十八头病牲口。在太岳、太岳各地的兽医站每天也有很多的牲口送去治疗，不但学生们在实习中学到了本事，群众也都说：“牲口有病已有了保障了。”各兽医教育站，经常有人从乡村里来要求学习兽医，他们在半年左右，已能学到看病治病，如各地地方学员能掌握医术时，即将其兽医站全部交给群众直接掌握（经过地方政府）。计今年有预备交给群众的兽医站十余处，俟政府批准后即可交出，并另设新站。
