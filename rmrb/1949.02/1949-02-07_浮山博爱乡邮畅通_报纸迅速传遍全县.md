　　Floating Mountain Boai Township Postal Service Unimpeded
  　Newspapers Rapidly Spread Throughout the County
    [Taiyue Telegram] The construction of rural postal services in Fushan has achieved great results in the past six months. In the past, letters and newspapers were delivered from the district to the village by entrusted individuals, which often resulted in delays or losses. Recently, the county bureau adopted a new method, using sixty li as a postal route, directly delivering to natural villages. The wages of rural postal workers are calculated by the li, with a subsidy of one and a half liang of millet per li traveled. The results of this experiment have been universally successful in various districts. The entire county has three post offices, three agency offices, and eight rural postal stations. After precise calculation, twenty-eight rural postal routes have been divided, connecting seventy-eight administrative villages and two hundred and seventy natural villages. Except for villages with fewer than ten households and no schools, all post offices and stations deliver directly. This has accelerated the speed of delivery. For example, the Taiyue Xinhua Bao arrives at the post office on the first night, and the entire county can generally see the newspaper by the afternoon of the second day. The most remote areas can see it by the third day. Some villages that are too far from the county bureau have also established rural postal relay stations in between. The rural postal network covers the entire county. Rural postal workers are also very satisfied and active because they are paid by the li. Some even work regardless of wind or rain.
    [Taihang News] The Boai rural postal service has been universally organized, and newspapers received on the same day can reach all villages in the county. All seven districts and one hundred and seventy-six administrative villages in the county have established district-village organizations and dedicated cadres in charge. Each district has also established a post office responsible for the receipt, distribution, and forwarding of letters and newspapers between the county, districts, and villages. Each village has established a rural postal collection and delivery point, which is managed by the village postal officer. The entire county is divided into twenty-one routes, totaling seven hundred and seventy-five li, connecting all administrative villages in the county. Each route has a fixed village for sending letters. This village then has a few fixed rural postal workers who take turns delivering. Workers are paid by the li, with sixty li being one work unit. The county has a total of forty-six fixed rural postal workers. Letters and newspapers received on the same day can be delivered to each village on the same day. Losses have gradually decreased.

　　浮山博爱乡邮畅通
  　报纸迅速传遍全县
    【太岳电】浮山乡邮建设半年来获得很大成绩。过去邮信、报纸由区到村，均托人带送，因此耽误时间或遗失情事经常发生。最近该县局采取新办法，以六十里为一邮程，直接投递到自然村。乡邮员工资以里计算，每走一里津贴小米一两半。这样试验结果，各区普遍成功了。全县三个邮务所，三个代办所，八个乡邮站，经过精确计算，划分了二十八条乡邮路线，贯穿着七十八个行政村，二百七十个自然村，除十户以下没有学校的村庄外，都是各所、站直接投递。由此加速了传递速度。如太岳新华报头一天夜里到了邮局，第二天下午全县一般就可看到报纸。最远的第三天也可看到。有些离县局太远的村子，中间还建立了乡邮接力站。乡邮网普及全县。乡邮员也因为采取了按里计算，很满意，很积极，有的甚至做到了风雨无阻。
    【太行讯】博爱乡邮普遍组织起来，当天收到的报纸能够到达全县各村。全县七个区一百七十六个行政村，全部建立了区村组织及专门负责干部；各区并建立一个邮务所，负责县区村来往信件报纸收发转寄。每个村建立了农村邮政收发处，由各村邮政干事负责收发。全县划了二十一条路线，共长七七五里，将全县行政村连接起来。每一条线固定一个村送信。这个村又固定几个乡邮工，每天轮流送。按里计工，六十里为一工，全县共固定乡邮工四六人，当天的信件报纸当天就能送到各村。丢失现象逐渐减少。
