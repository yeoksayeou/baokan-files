Shijiazhuang News: Since the Shijiazhuang Railway Bureau Locomotive Depot began reviewing its leadership in early December of last year, it has undergone a complete transformation. Significant progress has been made in its work, and the consciousness and production enthusiasm of the staff have increased. Previously, the former director of the depot exhibited serious Kuomintang work styles, deceiving superiors and subordinates, and suppressing active cadres. The Party organization in the depot was accommodating and tolerant, relaxing principles, and neglecting education. Additionally, there was a lack of planning, organization, regulations, systems, and inspections in production, which led to many serious shortcomings. In response to this situation, a comprehensive and in-depth review was conducted in early December of last year. The leadership was criticized, the director was replaced, and the Party, administrative, and labor union organizations all made self-criticisms. Subsequently, the Party branch was made public among the masses, education and criticism were strengthened, and Party members were called upon to take the lead and set an example. As a result, the enthusiasm of the staff has surged, and the entire locomotive depot has gradually become more active day by day.

　　In the General Affairs Office of the depot, a system of punctual attendance has been established and strictly enforced since the work review. Salary payments are no longer delayed. Accounting personnel said, "Now we know that we can't delay it, because it will hurt the workers. In the past, we didn't think about it. We would issue the salaries earlier if we received them earlier, and later if we received them later. Who cared if you suffered?" At the same time, the office has established an inspection team composed of two people, elected by everyone, and changed monthly. Everyone has also clarified the idea that "inspection work is not against people, but to make the work better," so the establishment of this inspection team has been very effective. Liu Guangxi, an accountant in the office, had previously been quite backward in his work and often delayed his accounts, but now he has become active. As soon as he is told something, he does it immediately. Once, he had to make supplementary payments to staff from the Baoding station. Because the bureau had not yet finalized the standards at that time, he ran back and forth three or four times without complaint.

　　Secondly, in the Traffic Control Office, the staff's sense of responsibility has been strengthened. On January 28th, the 262nd train from Dezhou to this city had a problem with the second axle copper tile on the right side of the locomotive water tank. The driver, Feng Youdu, and the firemen, Pan Qingfu and Tian Baojian, discovered the problem. They wanted to replace it, but there were no materials. They tried to find some engine oil to keep the train running. When the engine oil ran out, they were afraid of being late, so they stuffed the soap they had brought from Dezhou into the axle as a substitute. As a result, they arrived in Shijiazhuang on time. The spirit of active responsibility of all the staff won the praise of the entire depot. During the previous movement to慰劳 (express sympathy) the soldiers on the northern front, the depot planned to make 200慰劳 bags, but when the bags were collected, they exceeded the original quota by one-fifth. The staff of the Traffic Control Office were particularly enthusiastic.

　　During the Spring Festival holiday, to take care of equipment and prevent theft, the factory guards and Comrade Lu Deli discovered at night that the machine room in the basement was not locked. Lu immediately notified the office by telephone. Recently, the three locomotives sent by the "February 7th" Preparatory Committee to the east and west lines to hold commemorative meetings were not repaired half an hour before they were scheduled to depart. With the encouragement of comrades Wang Xingli, Lu Keliang, and Xu Lianzhong, and the workers, everyone said, "We must not delay their departure to the two lines." As a result, everyone made a concerted effort and completed the repairs in less than twenty minutes.

　　The staff of the depot have also achieved certain results in their studies. In the past, one often heard the saying, "Learning politics well won't help you drive a locomotive," so they had never studied hard. But now the staff's opinion is, "Even driving a locomotive, you have to see who you are driving for?" With the exception of a few staff members who still have some prejudices about learning, the overall learning situation in the locomotive depot has improved. Some people who had previously falsely reported overtime hours have also made self-criticisms, and the staff are encouraging each other to strive to complete their work within the prescribed time without working overtime. For example, on the 6th of this month, the renovation room refurbished six cars, more than double the previous daily output. Worker Zhao Fuxiang helped others after finishing his own work. Zhang Yintang called on everyone to complete the work without overtime, and as a result, the goal was achieved through joint efforts.

### 石市铁路局机务段　检查领导后面目一新

　　石市铁路局机务段
  　检查领导后面目一新
    【石家庄讯】铁路局机务段自去年十二月初检查领导以来，现已面目一新，工作上获得显著进步，职工觉悟提高，生产情绪增涨。由于过去该段前任段长，存在着严重的国民党作风，瞒上欺下，打击积极干部，而该段党的组织方面，迁就姑息，放松原则，忽视教育，加以生产中无计划、无组织、无规章、无制度，缺乏检查，而致使当时机务段发生许多严重缺点。针对这种情况，去年十二月初，进行了全面深入的检查，批评了领导，撤换了段长，党、行政和工会都作了检讨。接着，在群众中公开了党的支部，加强了教育和批评，号召党员起带头模范作用。这样一来，职工同志们的劲儿都上来了，整个机务段一天比一天地逐渐活跃起来。
    在该段总务室，自检查工作以后，按时上下班的制度建立并严格执行了。开支薪金也不再拖，会计人员说：“现在我们晓得拖不得了，拖了工人会吃亏。过去我们就不想，反正早领下来早发，迟领就迟发，谁还管你吃亏不吃亏。”同时该室还建立了检查组，由两人组成，大家推选，每月一换。大家在思想上也都明确了“检查工作不是对人，而是把工作搞得更好”，因此建立这种检查组以后，成效很好。该室会计员刘光熙，过去在工作上表现相当落后，帐目常常拖，但现在积极起来了，只要一告诉他，他就马上做。有一次追补保定来站工作人员的工资，因路局当时标准没订好，使他一连跑了三四次亦毫无怨言。
    其次在行车室，职工们的工作责任心加强了，一月二十八，从德县开赴本市的二六二次车，机车水柜右边第二个轴铜瓦磨损了。司机冯有度，司炉潘庆福、田宝鉴三人发现了这毛病，想换又没器材，便设法弄了些机油来维持行车，最后机油用完了，他们怕误了点，便把他们从德州捎来的肥皂塞进去作代用品，结果准时到了石家庄。大家积极负责的精神，赢得了全段职工的赞许。前次慰劳北线将士运动中，该段预计做慰劳袋是两百个，但到收慰劳袋时却超过原定额五分之一完成了。行车室的职工们尤其热烈。
    春节休假期内，为了留心器材，提防失窃，夜里，厂卫队和陆德立同志发现地下室的机器房没上锁，陆便马上用电话通知办公室。最近“二七”筹委会派赴东西线去开纪念会的三个火车头，要开出去前半点钟还没修好，在王兴礼、路克良、许连仲等同志和工人一鼓劲下，大家说：“咱们绝不能耽误他们到两线去。”结果，大家一突击，不到二十分钟就完成了。
    该段职工在学习上，亦获得了一定成绩。过去，常常可以听到这样的话：“学好了政治也开不了火车头”，所以一直没好好学过；但现在职工们的舆论是：“就说开火车头吧，也得看给谁开？”除个别职工对学习仍有某些偏见外，整个机务段的学习是进步了。对从前某些人谎报加班钟点的事，也作了检讨，职工同志们互相勉励争取不加班在规定时间内完成作业。比如，本月六日，装修室装好了六台车，比过去一天多了一倍，工友赵福祥干完自己的活还帮别人。张印堂号召要不加班完成，结果在齐努力之下，达到了目标。
