Xinhua News Agency, Beiping, 19th: Workers in Beiping now have their own trade unions. Since the successive establishment of preparatory committees for workers' unions in factories in the suburbs, they have been actively seeking worker welfare and strengthening worker learning and cultural and recreational work, which has been embraced by the masses of workers. The cooperative preparation office of the Changxindian Railway Workers' Union Preparatory Committee supplies over 16,000 railway workers and their families with daily necessities such as rice, flour, oil, salt, soy sauce, vinegar, vegetables, soap, and matches at prices 6-7% lower than the market price, giving the workers tangible benefits. Since liberation, the workers' night school, which was organized by railway workers themselves and taught by military control commission staff, has 230 workers participating. The workers have a high enthusiasm for learning and are able to use their spare time every night to study politics, mathematics, drafting, physics, and chemistry, and have requested the addition of specialized technical courses for each production unit. Influenced by the singing team of more than 300 people, which is mainly composed of workers' night school students, various workshops in the Changxindian Railway Factory have organized singing teams one after another. For example, the repair shop with more than 300 people has more than 100 people participating in the shop's singing team.

The workers' club of the Shijingshan Iron and Steel Factory Workers' Union Preparatory Committee has established a workers' drama troupe, an old opera group, a singing team, a Yangge dance team, and a sports group. Learning groups organized by department for politics, culture, business, and specialized technology are conducting learning enthusiastically. They have adopted the method of having workers with high technical skills teach workers with lower technical skills, thereby greatly increasing the workers' enthusiasm for labor. Currently, the learning groups led by the factory's union preparatory committee are enthusiastically展开ing discussions on production issues to assist the people's factory to quickly restore and develop production.

The consumer cooperative of the Mentougou Coal Mine Workers' Union Preparatory Committee supplies the workers with rice, flour, soap, and other items at prices one-tenth lower than the market price, thereby avoiding the exploitation of merchants. The association also pays great attention to the welfare of the workers. When workers' families arrive, they find houses for them and provide food and fuel. This action of solving difficulties for the workers is enthusiastically supported by the miners. The miners, who were oppressed and exploited by the Kuomintang's puppet trade union in the past, said: "The trade union that we have been longing for in our hearts for so many years, we have it today. We must unite around our own trade union, work hard, and build our new China."

Xinhua News Agency, Beiping, 22nd: The workers in Beiping are now enthusiastically strengthening their learning and establishing organizations such as trade unions. The workers of the Pingjin Railway Bureau have established workers' night schools, striving to improve their cultural and political level. At the same time, they have also established singing groups, dance groups, drama groups, etc., to carry out legitimate cultural and recreational activities in their spare time. As for the female employees of the bureau, they are currently also launching a women's association. More than 100 copies of Chairman Mao's work "On New Democracy" and the Xinhua News Agency's New Year's Day editorial "Carry the Revolution Through to the End", which were sold on consignment by the book and newspaper vending department of the Railway Bureau's Staff and Workers Association, were snapped up by the staff and workers in two days. Currently, more than 900 copies of the Beiping edition of the People's Daily are subscribed to on a long-term basis among the more than 3,000 workers in the entire bureau. The workers of the Beiping Telecommunications Bureau have elected their own preparatory committee members for the workers' union. The "Worker's Wall" of the Telecommunications Bureau is covered with colorful wall newspapers reporting on the various activities of the workers. The study groups organized by the staff of the Jibei Electric Power Company's Beiping branch, in addition to discussing Chairman Mao's work "The Chinese Revolution and the Chinese Communist Party," also invited staff members of the Beiping District Military Control Commission to explain the Chinese revolution. Employees of the Pingjin District Clothing Factory have been holding a rotating lecture series since the 15th of this month to explain the Eight Articles of Agreement announced by the Pingjin Front Headquarters of the Chinese People's Liberation Army and the urban policy of the Chinese Communist Party. Workers in other departments in Beiping are also working hard to study culture and revolutionary theory, gradually improving themselves.

　　北平各厂成立职工会筹备会
  　积极谋求职工福利
    工人踊跃参加学习及文娱活动
    【新华社北平十九日电】北平的工人现在有了自己的工会。市郊各工厂的职工会筹备会相继成立后，由于积极谋求职工福利，加强职工学习及文化娱乐工作受到了工人群众的拥护。长辛店铁路职工会筹备会的合作社筹备处，以低于市价百分之六七的价格供应一万六千余铁路职工，家属所必需的日用品：米、面、油、盐、酱、醋、菜、肥皂、洋火等，使职工们得到了实际的利益。解放后由铁路工人自动组织并请军管会工作人员负责教课的工人夜校已有二百三十个工人参加。工人们的学习情绪很高均能利用每晚工余时间，学习政治、数学、制图、理化，并且要求增添各生产单位的专门技术课程。在以工人夜校为主体的三百多人的歌咏队影响下，长辛店铁路工厂的各工场都纷纷组织歌咏队，如三百多人的修配场就有一百多人参加该场的歌咏队。
    石景山钢铁厂职工会筹备会的工人俱乐部，已成立了工人话剧团旧剧组、歌咏队、秧歌队以及体育组。按照部门组织的政治、文化、业务及专门技术的学习小组，正热烈的进行着学习。他们采取了由技术高的工人教技术低的工人的方法，因而大大提高了工人的劳动积极性。现在该厂工会筹备会领导的各学习小组正热烈展开生产问题的讨论，以协助人民的工厂得以迅速恢复和发展生产。
    门头沟煤矿职工会筹备会的消费合作社，以低于市价十分之一的价格大部供应职工以米面肥皂等物，由此避免了商人的中间剥削。该会还非常注意职工的福利。当职工家属来了，就给找房子，借吃借烧，这种为工人弟兄解决困难的行动，得到矿工们热烈拥护。过去受国民党御用工会欺压剥削的矿工们说：“多少年来心里想望的工会，今天咱们已经有了。一定要团结在自己的工会周围，好好干活，建设咱们的新中国。”
    【新华社北平二十二日电】北平的工人们现在热烈地加强学习和建立职工会等组织。平津铁路局的职工们，已经成立了职工夜校，努力提高自己的文化政治水平。他们同时又成立了歌咏组、舞蹈组、话剧组等，来进行工余正当的文化娱乐。至于路局的女职员们，目前也在发起组织妇女会。由路局职工联谊会书报贩卖部代售的毛主席著作“新民主主义论”和新华社元旦社论“将革命进行到底”一百多本书，两天之内，被职工们抢购一空。现在全路局三千多工人中，就长期订阅人民日报北平版九百多份。北平电讯局的职工们已选出他们自己的职工会筹备委员。电讯局的“工人墙”上，则贴满了红红绿绿的壁报，报导职工们的各种活动。冀北电力公司北平分公司职员们组织的学习小组，除了讨论毛主席著作“中国革命与中国共产党”之外，并邀请北平区军事管制委员会的工作人员去讲解中国革命问题。平津区被服厂职工，从本月十五日开始举行轮回演讲会，讲解中国人民解放军平津前线司令部所宣布约法八章和中国共产党的城市政策。北平其他部门的职工，也在努力地学习文化和革命理论，逐步提高自己。
