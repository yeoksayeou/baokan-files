　　First Aid for Coal Gas Poisoning
    In winter, if you use fire or burn charcoal indoors and the doors and windows are closed too tightly, with little ventilation from the outside, people inside are prone to coal gas poisoning. Those who are poisoned experience dizziness, difficulty breathing, a flushed face, and sometimes nausea and vomiting. In severe cases, breathing stops, even leading to death.
    The method of treatment is: For mild poisoning, quickly move the person to a well-ventilated place outside. If they cannot walk, carry them out. Open the doors and windows of the room to allow fresh air to circulate. Cover the head with a towel soaked in cold water, loosen the clothing around the chest, and drink some vinegar or sour soup. If possible, it would be even better to drink juice squeezed from a white radish. If breathing has stopped, but the heart is still beating, don't worry; artificial respiration can be used for treatment.
    Artificial respiration is an emergency method for all cases where breathing has stopped but the person is not yet dead. The method is: Lay the patient on their back, elevate the waist, loosen the clothing, and pull the tongue out to prevent it from blocking the throat and hindering breathing. If the jaws are tightly closed, use chopsticks to pry them open. Have someone straddle the patient's legs, bend over, and forcefully compress the patient's chest with both palms. This will allow the patient to exhale the gas from their internal organs. Then, release the palms and straighten up, which allows air to be inhaled. The best pace is about fifteen times per minute. After half an hour to three hours, the patient should recover. The person performing this method must be patient and not give up halfway.

　　煤气中毒急救法
    冬天屋里升火或烧炭，门窗要是关得太严，和外面很少通气的时侯，屋里的人就容易中煤气毒。中了毒的人，头晕、呼吸困难，面部发红，有时恶心呕吐，重的就停止了呼吸，甚而死去。
    救治的方法是：中毒轻的，要赶快到外面空气流通的地方去，不能走的，可以抬出去。将屋里的门窗打开，好换进新鲜的空气进来，把手巾用冷水蘸湿，盖着头部，解开胸部衣服，再喝一些醋或酸汤，如果能喝下从白萝卜中挤出的汁就更好。假如呼吸已经停止，而心口还跳动，也不要紧，可以用人工呼吸法来救治。
    人工呼吸法是一切停止呼吸而还没死的急救法。方法是：使患者仰卧，把腰部垫高，解开身上的衣服，将舌头拉出，省得堵住嗓子妨碍呼吸，牙关紧闭时，可用筷子撬开。由一人跨在患者的腿上，弯下腰去，两掌用力压缩患者的胸廓，这时患者就能把内脏的气呼出，随着放松两掌直起腰来，这样可使吸入空气。做的快慢，以每分钟十五次最好，经半点钟到三点钟的时间，患者就能恢复过来。用这个方法做的人，要耐心不可半途而废。
