Xinhua News Agency, East China, 26th—The more than 60,000 laborers from Jiaodong who victoriously completed their task of supporting the front have now been demobilized and returned to their hometowns. Wherever they passed on their journey home, the people of each village held red flags, beat drums and gongs to welcome them, and provided accommodations. Party and government organs and mass organizations at the county and district levels specially held celebration meetings, awarded prizes and presented flowers to congratulate and celebrate the meritorious deeds of the heroes who had rendered meritorious service on the front lines. The laborers all responded to the welcomers' greetings with "Return home to continue making contributions and support the People's Liberation Army in liberating all of China."
