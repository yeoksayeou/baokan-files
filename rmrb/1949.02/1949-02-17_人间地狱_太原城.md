　　Human Hell - Taiyuan City
　　Wu Xiang
　　The arch-criminal war criminal Yan Xishan is intensifying his monstrous crimes. He has turned the entire Taiyuan into a human hell filled with disaster and tears.

　　Here, people wake up in the morning and have to worry about the day ahead. Everyone is driven to engage in endless, arduous labor, and who knows when they will be sent to be cannon fodder. What can a seven-year-old child do? What can a sixty-year-old man do? However, even seven-year-old children and sixty-year-old men have been incorporated into the "Elderly Assistance Team" and the "Childhood Assistance Team." Even pregnant women with bound feet have to participate in service. On November 10th of last year, the "Battle City" formation ended. From this time on, even students who are studying or mid-to-lower level public employees working in Yan's various organs, just like other citizens, are driven with whips to carry bricks, transport soil, build gun emplacements and flat airfields. From November 16th to the 21st, Yan's "City Mobilization Command for War Participation" issued "Battle City Wearing Symbols" to "prevent escape, concealment, and harboring." Then, a sudden large-scale inspection began, and anyone without a symbol was arrested and conscripted into the army. Now, Taiyuan citizens must not only have a "National Identity Card," a "Soldier-Farmer Integrated Organization Certificate," but also a "Battle City Symbol" to be considered "legal." However, does being "legal" mean that one will not be arrested? On November 19th, four war participation teams outside Shouyi Gate gathered at Xinghualing in the city for a meeting. It was not until dark that their families, crying, returned after searching for them, only to find out that they had all been arrested. On the 28th, more than 350 students from Guoshi, Gongzhi, Taishi, and Taizhong were also captured into the artillery regiment under the pretext of "farewell." Nighttime in Taiyuan is terrifying. The streets are under curfew, and citizens keep their doors and windows tightly closed, and any noise can cause prolonged panic for the whole family. In the fields near the gun emplacements around the city, people are crawling, risking their lives to escape. They would rather be blown up by mines on the blockade line or be discovered, tied up, and executed than serve in Yan's army. Hou Xuesun, who runs a dim sum shop in Liuxiang, tried to escape three times but failed. His leg was injured, but he gritted his teeth and continued to run outward. Yan became anxious and arrested people more fiercely. Anyone who escaped or "accepted bribes" to let people go was punished as a "disguised element." As of now, at least 30,000 people have been arrested, and the blood and tears contained in this number are indescribable. In order to live one more day, Yan is willing to sacrifice the lives of tens of thousands of people. He has even adopted such means as arresting female students to serve as duty messengers in order to free up more people to go to the front line to fight for him. Several students from Qingyuan Girls' High School who recently escaped confirmed this hard-to-believe fact. Yan boasts that "Battle City" is an "unprecedented creation," but who knows what else this hideous demon king will do?

　　What threatens the citizens of Taiyuan even more seriously than death is hunger. Yan's party and government personnel who fled into Taiyuan from various counties in Jinzhong organized a huge "Wartime Mobilization Work Group" to directly carry out searches in various neighborhoods, registering almost even a pencil. A folk song says: "The Work Group, manages everything: a bag of grain, money, cigarettes, pickles, military shoes, and door panels." The "Work Group" forces children of the "Childhood Team" to "raise donations" on the street. If anyone refuses, they will search them. Lifeng Oil Mill in Dananguan Middle Street, within two months, gave 30 shi of wheat once, 5,000 jin of white flour once, and 12 shi of wheat again, as well as countless sacks, rafters, door panels, and cigarettes... Many shops sold everything and still could not afford the assigned funds. Even the door panels were taken away. Of the 3,500 shops in the city, only less than 1,400 remain. But after the new year, Yan sent down another 90,000 shi of wheat. Probably because it was impossible to squeeze any more out, he sent troops to live in the homes of merchants and civilians to eat, and they would not stop until everything was gone. Hunger has greatly increased the chaos in Taiyuan. Robberies are endless. Juqingxiang Gold and Jewelry Store in Maoer Lane was robbed, and the People's Second Theater was robbed. On January 10th alone, seven bicycles were stolen. The workers and poor people, who make up the majority of Taiyuan's population, have not seen rice or flour for months. Liu Jisu, a railway worker who escaped before the new year, said that he had not tasted salt for a whole month and three days. A worker named Wu at No. 35 Qiaodong Street, her husband was arrested, and the wife was left alone to guard four hungry and crying children. The demands for grain and money still come more and more urgently. She sold all the broken furniture, and after two more days of hunger, she could no longer support herself. At night, this poor "cruel" mother coaxed her children to sleep, and then strangled them one by one with a rope, and finally hanged herself. There are many people selling their children by the Haizi, with grass inserted in their heads, marking the price. Outside Shouyi Gate, groups of emaciated little beggars linger every day, staring at the customers in front of the food stalls, fighting each other for a bit of rice that accidentally falls. At night, they huddle under the stove, relying on the embers of the stove fire. In this long winter night, they resist the severe cold with empty stomachs and weakness, and often stiffen there at dawn. The most who die are the wounded soldiers. Yan is extremely cruel to disabled and useless wounded soldiers. Many of them have been stripped of their cotton clothes and driven out of the city. The streets are full of blind and legless wounded soldiers begging. Severely wounded soldiers have little hope of survival. Some are dragged out and buried before they even breathe their last. The large barracks in the south of the city are crowded with wounded soldiers. Because too many die, they are buried only every three days. A large number are buried at a time, and they are simply covered with soil. In the early morning or at dusk, in remote places, wild dogs even chase after human heads and human legs.

　　In contrast, Yan Xishan and other bandit leaders still lead extravagant lives. Without exception, they seek final satisfaction in smoke, wine, and women. Bandit Commander Wang Jingguo embraces the actress Zhang Shanqin. Bandit Mayor Bai Zhiyi embraces the actress Liang Xiaoyun, and is in a daze all day long. The more they feel the approach of death, the more corrupt they become, and the more greedy and brutal they become. The more terrible the shocking tragedy becomes.

　　The suffering people of Taiyuan are anxiously waiting for the sound of the artillery to attack the city! They wrote a letter of entreaty, each word a tear, and smuggled it out of the city, bypassing Yan's blockade, asking the People's Liberation Army to launch a general offensive quickly: "We look forward day and night, our hearts are bleeding, our eyes are falling out, why is the city not broken? Chairman Mao is afraid of accidentally hurting the good people, please quickly open the city of Taiyuan, we will be willing to die in the underworld." Yes, they can no longer bear it. They are angry to the point of almost exploding in unbearable pain. The slogan "Kill Yan the Bandit" has appeared publicly on the streets more than once. The pseudo-gold yuan coupon was originally set at ten yuan for one silver dollar, but now it has plummeted to more than 500 yuan, and some people simply refuse to use it. The great victories of the People's Liberation Army have been reported again and again, making the citizens of Taiyuan stronger day by day. Many citizens have begun to resist the extortion of the "Work Group": "We have nothing to give, but you can have our lives!" They firmly believe that the day of liberation is not far away. People say when they meet: "Once Pingjin is liberated, Taiyuan is finished!" The people of Taiyuan will never forget "Battle City," this human hell, and will never forgive Yan Xishan and all the arch-criminal war criminals!

　　人间地狱——太原城
    吴象
    罪大恶极的头等战犯阎锡山，正在变本加厉地继续着滔天的罪行。他已经把整个太原变为一座充满灾难和血泪的人间地狱。
    在这里，人们早晨醒来，就不得不为这一天耽心。所有的人都被驱赶着从事无穷尽的苦重的劳役，而且，说不定什么时候就被送去当了炮灰。七岁的小孩子能做什么呢？六十岁的老头子又能做什么呢？但是，连七岁的小孩子和六十岁的老头子也被编进了“老人助战队”和“幼年助战队”。甚至怀孕的小脚妇女，还要参加服役。去年十一月十日，“战斗城”编队结束。从这时候起，即使是正在念书的学生或任职于阎匪各机关的中下级公教人员，亦和其他市民同样的在皮鞭下去背砖、抬土、修炮碉和平飞机场。十一月十六日至廿一日，阎匪“市动员参战总指挥部”“为杜绝潜逃、隐匿、包庇”，又制发了“战斗城佩带符号”。接着，突然的大检查开始了，没有符号的一律被抓去当兵。现在，太原市民不仅要有“国民身份证”，要有“兵农合一的编组证”，而且要有“战斗城符号”才能算“合法”。然而，“合法”就不会被抓去了么？十一月十九日，首义门外四个参战队，集合到城里杏花岭去开会了，直到天黑去找寻他们的家属哭着回来，才知道全部被抓走了。二十八日，国师、工职、太师、太中三百五十多学生，也在“欢送”的名义下，被抓到了炮兵团。黑夜在太原是恐怖的。街上戒严了，市民们紧闭着门窗，任何响动都会引起全家长久的惊悸。城周炮碉附近的田野里，则爬着冒死逃难的人们。他们宁愿被封锁线上的地雷炸死，或者被查觉绑回来枪毙，也不愿替阎匪当兵。在柳巷开点心铺的侯学孙，连跑三次没有跑脱，被打伤了腿，但他咬着牙还要向外跑。阎匪急了，就抓得更凶，任何逃亡的与“受贿”放走人的，一律以“伪装分子”论“罪”处决。截至现在止，被抓的至少已有三万人，这个数字所包含的血与泪是难以尽述的。阎匪为了自己能够多活一天，就不惜拿成千上万的人头去拚。他甚至已经采用这样的手段：把女学生抓去当勤务传令，以便抽出更多的人到第一线去替他卖命。最近逃出来的几个清源女中的学生，证实了这件很难使人相信的事实。阎匪吹嘘“战斗城”是“无先例的创举”，谁知道这狰狞的魔王还会干出些什么来呢？
    比死亡更严重地威胁着太原市民的是饥饿。晋中各县逃入太原的阎匪党政人员，组织了一个庞大的“战时动员工作团”，直接到各个闾去进行搜刮，几乎连一支铅笔也要登记，民谣说：“战工团，啥都管：一袋（口袋、草袋、麻袋）粮、款、纸烟、咸菜、军鞋、门板”。“战工团”逼令“幼年队”的儿童沿街“募捐”，谁不出就动手搜。大南关中街的利丰油坊，两个月之内，一次出了卅石麦子，一次出了五千斤白面，又一次出了十二石麦子，还有数不清的麻袋、檩椽、门板、纸烟……许多铺子变卖光了也不够摊派下的款项。真的连门板也被抬光了。全城三千五百多家商号，现在只剩了不到一千四百家。但是阳历年后，阎匪又派下了九万石麦子，大概实在是再榨不出来了，竟派队伍住到商民家里去吃，不吃光不止。饥饿大大加重了太原的混乱。抢案更是层出不穷，帽儿巷聚庆祥金珠店被抢了，民众第二剧院被抢了。一月十日一天，自行车被窃的就有七处。占太原人口主要部分的工人和贫民，已经几个月没有和米面见面了。年前逃出来的铁路工人刘计素说：他整整一个月零三天没有尝咸味。桥东街卅五号一家姓吴的工人，丈夫被抓走了，妻子独自守着四个饥饿啼哭的孩子，催粮催款的仍然一次紧一次的来逼，她卖光了一切破烂的家俱，又饥了两天终于不能支持了。到晚上，这个可怜的“忍心”的母亲，哄着孩子们睡了，然后用绳子一个一个把他们勒死，最后再悬梁自尽。海子边有许多人在卖自己的孩子，头上插着草，标着价。首义门外，每日徘徊着一群群饿得骨瘦如柴的小乞丐，在吃食摊前死盯着买客，为着争抢偶然落下的一点饭屑，而互相殴打。他们夜间就蜷缩在灶炉底下，靠炉火的那一点余烬。在这漫长的冬夜，饿着肚子无力地抗御着严寒，往往天亮就僵死在那里了。死得最多的是伤兵，阎匪对残废无用了的伤员，再残酷也没有了。其中有许多已被剥掉了棉衣撵出城来。街上到处是瞎眼断腿的伤兵在行乞。重伤员很少有活的希望，有的还没有断气就被拖出去埋了。城南大兵营挤满了伤员，因为死得太多，三天才埋一次，一埋就是一大批，了了草草地用土盖住了就算。清晨或是黄昏，偏僻地方，野狗竟衔着人头人腿追逐着。
    与这相反，阎锡山以及别的匪首们的生活仍然是穷奢极侈的，他们毫无例外地都在烟、酒、女色中寻觅最后的满足。匪总司令王靖国抱着女伶张善琴。匪市长白志沂抱着女伶梁筱云，整日昏昏沉沉。他们愈是感到死亡的逼近，就不但愈加糜烂，而且愈加贪婪、愈加残暴、骇人听闻的惨剧也就愈来愈可怕了。
    苦难的太原人民，多么焦急地在等待着攻城的炮声呵！他们写了一字一泪的恳求书，偷越阎匪的封锁送出城外，请求解放军迅速发动总攻：“我们昼夜盼想心滴血，＠望＠得眼珠落，不破城是因为甚？毛圣人怕误伤了好人民，千万赶快打开太原城，我们死在阴曹也甘心。”是的，他们已经不能忍受了。他们在不能忍受的痛苦中愤怒到几乎快要爆炸。“打死阎贼”的标语不止一次公然在街头出现。伪金圆券规定十元换一块银洋，现在已暴跌到五百多元，有的人且干脆拒绝使用。解放军的大捷报一次又一次传来，使太原市民一天比一天强硬。许多市民开始在对抗“战工团”的勒索：“要东西没有，要命有！”他们坚信，解放的日子是不远了。人们见面就说：“平津一解放，太原就完蛋！”太原人民将永远不会忘记“战斗城”这一座人间地狱，也永远不会饶恕阎锡山和一切罪大恶极的战犯！
