　　Only Flying to the Liberated Areas is a Way Out
　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　Yu Bo and Others Interviewed

　　"Only flying to the Liberated Areas is a way out," said Yu Bo, a former Kuomintang Air Force Eighth Squadron Lieutenant pilot who defected from Nanjing in a B-24 heavy bomber, to a reporter. "On the night of December 15th last year, Wang Shuming (Deputy Commander-in-Chief of the Kuomintang Air Force) gave our Air Force Eighth Squadron a toast on the orders of Chiang Kai-shek, praising us on the spot for our 'suppression of the rebellion,' our loyalty and proactiveness, and our excellent skills, treating us to plenty of whiskey, champagne, and other fine liquors. The next evening, Chiang Kai-shek personally comforted us and even wanted to give us a lecture. Fortunately, the moon was bright that night, so we took the opportunity to fly to the Liberated Areas."
　　The reporter met Yu Bo a few days ago in the living room of a brown building in a certain place. Sitting beside him were Lieutenant Bomber Zhou Zuozhou and Lieutenant Pilots Hao Guiqiao and Chen Jiuying, who defected on the same plane. They were wearing brand-new khaki military uniforms and looked very energetic. When the reporter asked them to talk about their experience of flying to the Liberated Areas, Yu Bo started the topic. Yu continued: "Our action represents the answer of patriotic youths in the Kuomintang Air Force to Wang Shuming's 'toast' and Chiang Kai-shek's 'comfort.' We chose to take off with a plane carrying five bombs, each weighing one thousand pounds. After we took off, we returned all the bombs to them. Maybe Chiang Kai-shek was still praising our loyalty and proactiveness, and our 'suppression of the rebellion,' then the roar of the exploding bombs was the slap in the face we gave to Chiang Kai-shek."
　　Yu is twenty-three years old, from Hangzhou, but born in Peiping. After the "July 7th" Incident, he studied in Wuhan, Guilin, Chongqing and other places. He was once a reader of the New China Daily, the organ of the Chinese Communist Party published in Chongqing. He, Hao Guiqiao, and Chen Jiuying were classmates and colleagues. At the end of 1944, he was admitted to the Kuomintang Air Force School and trained in India and the United States for two years, returning to China at the end of 1946. Yu recounted that when they applied for the Air Force, they were motivated by anti-Japanese enthusiasm, but in the past two years, they had participated in the civil war, feeling distressed. After talking about their joint planning of the defection, he eloquently described what they saw and heard after arriving in the Liberated Areas, saying: "This is a completely different world from Nanjing and Shanghai. There, people working for the Kuomintang are lazy, muddling through, and perfunctory. Here it is completely different. After our plane landed that night, it was said that the plane should be camouflaged, so thousands of PLA soldiers immediately pushed the extremely heavy plane to the edge of the airport, and then countless villagers carrying straw and sorghum stalks poured in from all directions. The airport was filled with people, and in a short while, the plane was camouflaged. I have never seen such collective strength, such spirit."
　　"After we landed, we met the garrison commander of the area. His knowledge of military and air force issues impressed us very much. After our conversation, we learned that it was he who decided to let us land. That night, when we flew to the area, all the ground lights suddenly went out. We flew very low and saw the airport, but the airport was covered with obstacles. So we turned on the landing lights to show that we were not hostile and asked to land. Based on these circumstances, Commander So-and-so quickly consulted with all parties and decided to clear the airport obstacles and light torches to guide us to land."
　　"After arriving here, everything we saw satisfied us. The towering chimneys are smoking every day. Although I have not yet visited the factory, this proves that the factories here are all operating. This is completely different from what I saw in Shanghai and Nanjing. There, factories are constantly closing down in large numbers, and many chimneys are not smoking. If a few days ago there were three chimneys smoking, then two days later there would only be two chimneys smoking, and two days later all the chimneys would not be smoking."
　　Hao Guiqiao told the reporter a lot about the chaotic and embarrassing situation of the Nanjing Kuomintang small court fleeing to Taiwan and other places. He said: "Many air force personnel who followed them to Taiwan could not even get enough to eat, and as a result, they ran back." Yu Bo finally said: "From the day we flew to the Liberated Areas until now, within a month, as far as I know, six planes and sixteen air force personnel have flown to the Liberated Areas. In the future, this kind of thing will continue to happen in large numbers. The Kuomintang government will soon collapse, and everyone can see this clearly. Now all the facts prove a truth: Kuomintang Air Force personnel only have a way out by flying to the Liberated Areas; following the Kuomintang to escape is a dead end."

　　只有飞来解放区才是生路
  　俞渤等访问记
    从南京驾Ｂ二四式重轰炸机起义的前国民党空军第八大队中尉驾驶员俞渤对记者这样说：“去年十二月十五日夜间王叔铭（国民党空军副总司令）奉蒋介石之命给我们空军八大队敬酒，当场捧了我们一顿，说我们‘戡乱’有功呀，忠实积极呀，技术优良呀，请我们吃了许多威士忌、香槟等好酒。第二天晚上蒋介石又亲自慰劳我们，还要训话。正好那天晚上月光皎洁，我们就趁此机会飞到解放区来了。”
    记者日前会见愈渤，是在某地一座咖啡色大厦的客厅里，旁坐者有同机起义的中尉轰炸员周作舟，中尉驾驶员郝桂桥、陈九英。他们穿着崭新的草黄色军服，精神很饱满。记者要他们谈谈这次飞来解放区的经过，这样就引起了俞渤的话题。俞继续说：“我们的这种行动，表示国民党空军中爱国青年对于王叔铭的‘敬酒’、蒋介石的‘慰劳’的答复。我们是选择了载有五颗各有一千磅重的炸弹的飞机起飞的。当我们起飞之后，就把炸弹通通回敬了他们。也许蒋介石当时还在称赞我们忠实积极呀，‘戡乱’有功呀，那么，炸弹爆炸的狂响，就是我们回答蒋介石的耳光。”
    俞二十三岁，祖籍杭州，生于北平。“七七”事变后，曾在武汉、桂林、重庆等地求学，他曾经是重庆出版的中国共产党机关报新华日报的读者。他与郝桂桥、陈九英是同学同事，一九四四年底考入国民党空军学校，曾到印度和美国受训二年，一九四六年底回国。俞在历述他们投考空军时，是激于抗日热情，但近两年来参加内战，内心苦闷，于谈过共同谋划起义经过的情形后，便滔滔不绝地叙述了他们到达解放区后的见闻说：“这里和南京、上海完全是两个世界，那里人们给国民党做事都是懒洋洋的，得过且过，敷衍了事。这里却完全不同。那天晚上我们的飞机着陆以后，说是要把飞机伪装起来，于是千百个解放军战士马上就把极其笨重的飞机推到机场边，紧紧接着从四面八方涌来了无数抬着稻草、挑着秫秸的老乡，机厂里黑压压的全是人，不一会就把飞机伪装好了。这种集体的力量，这种精神，我从来没有见过。”
    “我们在着陆以后，会见了该地的警备司令。他对军事以及对空军的许多问题的知识，使我们十分敬佩。我们谈话之后，才知道让我们着陆是他决定的。那天晚上，我们飞到该地时，地面灯火突然全部熄灭了。我们飞得很低，看到了机场，但机场上遍布着障碍物，于是我们开了落地灯，表示我们没有敌意，要求降落。某司令根据这些情况判断，迅速与各方商量，才决定清除机场障碍，燃着火把，指示我们降落下来。”
    “到了此地以后，我们所看见的都使我们满意。林立的烟囱，每天都冒着烟。虽然我还没有去参观工厂，但这可以证明，这里工厂都开着工。这和我看见的上海、南京的情形完全不同。那里工厂不断大批倒闭，很多烟囱不冒烟，那里如果几天以前有三个烟囱冒烟的话，那么过两天就只剩两个烟囱冒烟，再过两天就全部不冒烟了。”
    郝桂桥向记者谈了许多关于南京国民党小朝廷逃往台湾等地的那种鸡飞狗跳墙的狼狈情形。他说：“很多空军人员跟着跑到台湾以后，连饭都吃不饱，结果又跑回来了。”俞渤最后说：“从我们飞来解放区的那天起，到现在为止的一个月内，据我知道的，就有六架飞机，十六个空军人员飞到解放区来了。今后这类事情将会不断地大量发生。国民党政府很快就要垮台，这谁也看得清楚。现在一切事实说明了一个真理：国民党空军人员只有飞到解放区来，才有生路，跟着国民党逃跑，那是死路一条。”
