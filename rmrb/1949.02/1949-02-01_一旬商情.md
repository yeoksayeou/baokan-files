　　Ten-Day Market Report
    (January 7th to 17th)
    Huabei Trade General Corporation Market Information Section

    Over the past ten days, under the strong regulation of state-owned commerce, prices in most areas of the North China region have shifted from fluctuation to stability. However, due to last year's floods in the southwest of Shandong along both banks of the Yellow River, agricultural production suffered, and with the expansion of newly recovered areas and the increase in cities, the scope of material circulation has also expanded. Therefore, prices in this area have risen sharply recently, affecting price fluctuations in the western part of southern Hebei (around Handan). Grains and cotton led the way, followed by other goods. Prices in East China have also risen sharply in the past ten days, with grain prices in Jinan rising by more than double, and industrial products and daily necessities rising by 70% to 80%. Prices in the Central Plains and Shanxi-Suiyuan regions are generally stable. The specific situation of various goods in each region is reported separately as follows:
