　　Soviet Workers in Two Major Mining Areas Launch Socialist Competition
  　Guarantee Five-Year Plan Completion in Four Years

　　Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 8th: TASS Moscow dispatch: On January 27th, miners from the Donets Coalfield in the Stalino Oblast wrote a letter to Stalin, guaranteeing that their 1949 production would reach the 1950 level stipulated by the Five-Year Plan, and would exceed the plan by 300,000 tons of coal. The letter also called on miners in the Kuznetsk Basin to participate in the socialist competition to complete the 1949 coal production plan ahead of schedule. The Kuznetsk miners accepted this challenge. On February 1st, the Kuznetsk miners wrote to Stalin, announcing their decision to engage in socialist competition with the miners of the Stalino Oblast. The Kuznetsk Coalfield miners guaranteed that this year's output would reach the level stipulated for 1950 in the Five-Year Plan, exceeding the plan by 360,000 tons of coal.

　　The Pravda, in commenting on this competition between the two coal mines, pointed out: Although the two coalfields are thousands of kilometers apart, the militant call of the Donets miners (referring to the largest coal-producing area in the western Soviet Union) was immediately echoed by the miners of the largest coal-producing area in the eastern Soviet Union. The Pravda emphasized that the competition between the Donets Basin and the Kuznetsk Basin is of great importance to the further development of the entire Soviet national economy.

　　苏联东西两大矿区工人
  　发起社会主义竞赛
    保证五年计划四年完成
    【新华社陕北八日电】塔斯社莫斯科讯：一月二十七日，斯大林诺州顿尼兹煤田的矿工写信给斯大林，保证他们一九四九年的产量，将达到五年计划所规定的一九五○年的水平，并超计划产煤三十万吨。信中并号召库兹涅茨克盆地的矿工参加提前完成一九四九年产煤计划的社会主义竞赛。库兹涅茨克的矿工接受了这一挑战。二月一日，库兹涅茨克矿工写信给斯大林，宣布他们决定与斯大林诺州的矿工进行社会主义竞赛。库兹涅茨克煤田矿工保证今年的产量将达到五年计划所规定的一九五○年所要达到的水平，且超计划产煤三十六万吨。
    真理报在评论两处煤矿工人的这一竞赛时指出：虽然两个煤田相距数千公里，可是，顿尼兹（按系苏联西部最大的产煤区）矿工的战斗号召立刻为苏联东部最大的产煤区的矿工所响应。真理报着重指出：顿尼兹盆地与库兹涅茨克盆地的竞赛，对苏联整个国民经济进一步的发展，有着巨大的重要性。
