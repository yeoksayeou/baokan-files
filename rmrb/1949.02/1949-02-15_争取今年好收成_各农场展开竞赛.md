Striving for a Good Harvest This Year
　　Various Farms Launch Competitions
    Regarding the preparation of farm tools and draught animals, the decision pointed out: By February 1st, collective farms had overhauled more than half of their horse-drawn plows, seeders, and cultivators. The management of draught animals for spring plowing has been well organized.
    Agricultural techniques implemented by collective farms in most regions during the winter have been much better than in the previous season. The victorious recovery and development of the chemical industry has greatly increased the production of mineral fertilizers. In 1949, agriculture will receive 18.3 percent more mineral fertilizers than in 1948, and 33 percent more than in 1940. In order to preserve moisture in the soil, snow storage and spring rainwater storage are of high importance for ensuring good harvests every year. Most states, border regions, and many collective farms in the republics are now carrying out snow storage work in the fields. As of February 1st, the area of snow storage by collective farms reached 11.8 million hectares, equivalent to more than three times that of the same period last year.
    The decision emphasized that personnel must be trained for agriculture. Machine and tractor stations have made good preparations for the spring season. The equipment of machine and tractor stations has greatly increased compared with last year, and a large number of new sowing and cultivating machines made in the Soviet Union will be added this year. To ensure that machine and tractor stations have sufficient technical personnel, tractor drivers and driving team leaders are being trained.
    The decision pointed out that state farms under the Soviet State Farm Department, the Soviet Meat and Dairy Industry Department, and the Soviet Food Industry Department have made better preparations for spring sowing than last year.
    The decision pointed out: At present, in order to strive for victorious spring sowing, carry out spring sowing, and achieve a good harvest in 1949, a fervent socialist competition has been launched on collective farms, machine and tractor stations, and state farms.

　　争取今年好收成
  　各农场展开竞赛
    至于农具与耕畜的准备，该决定指出：集体农场到二月一日为止，已整顿好过半数的马拉犁、播种机及耕耘机。为了春季耕作而进行的耕畜的料理工作，已经很好地加以组织。
    大多数地区的集体农场在冬季所进行的农业技术措施，比前一季好得多。化学工业的胜利恢复与发展，已使矿物肥料的出产大大增加。一九四九年，农业所获得的矿物肥料，将比一九四八年多百分之十八点三，比一九四○年多百分之三十三。为了把水分保存在土壤中，储雪及春季雨水储存对保证年年丰收具有高度重要性。大部分州和边疆区及共和国的许多集体农场，现正在田地上进行储雪工作。到二月一日，集体农场储雪面积达一千一百八十万公顷，相当于去年同期的三倍之多。
    该决定着重说明：必须为农业训练人员。机器与拖拉机站已为春季作了良好的准备工作。机器与拖拉机站的设备与去年比较，已大大增加，今年将再增加大批苏联制造的播种与耕耘的新机器。为了保证机器与拖拉机站有足够的技术人员起见，正在训练拖拉机驾驶员与驾驶队队长。
    决定指出：苏联国营农场部、苏联肉类与奶品工业部及苏联食品工业部所属的国营农场，春播准备工作比去年做的更好。
    决定指出：目前，为了争取胜利的准备春播、进行春播以及一九四九年的丰收，集体农场、机器与拖拉机站和国营农场上，已展开了热烈的社会主义竞赛。
