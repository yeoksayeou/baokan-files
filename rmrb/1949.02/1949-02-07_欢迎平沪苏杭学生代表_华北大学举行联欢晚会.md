　　Welcoming Student Representatives from Beiping, Shanghai, Jiangsu, and Hangzhou
  　North China University Holds a Joint Evening Party
    [Our Newspaper's Dispatch] To welcome the twenty-odd representatives from Beiping, Shanghai, Jiangsu, and Hangzhou who participated in the All-China Students' Federation, North China University held a grand welcome evening party on the 25th of last month. Those present included Vice President of North China University, Fan Wenlan, Professor He Ganzhi, and over a hundred student representatives from North China University. At the beginning of the meeting, Comrade Li Xin, the chairman, gave a speech, stating briefly: We would first like to welcome the representatives from Beiping, Shanghai, Jiangsu, and Hangzhou who have come despite their hard work. In the past, the Kuomintang reactionaries isolated us for a long time, but thanks to the victory of the people, we have broken through this Great Wall, and we have gathered victoriously. In his speech, Vice President Fan pointed out: The representatives from various places who have come to participate in the Student Federation represent the vast number of young people in China. Their arrival is the same as the arrival of millions of young people. Vice President Fan finally emphasized: In order to carry the revolution through to the end and to achieve the victory of the New Democratic construction, we should strengthen theoretical study and arm our minds with Mao Zedong Thought, so that we can always be victorious.
    When speaking, the representative of the teaching community of Shanghai Middle School made a sharp comparison between the education in the liberated areas and the education in the KMT-controlled areas. He said: I visited several middle schools in Shijiazhuang, which moved and excited me very much. I saw that they were all very healthy and happy, and their grades were determined by democratic evaluation; in the KMT-controlled areas, they cannot get enough to eat, too many students get lung disease, and they are forced to undergo military training. Today, the students in the liberated areas are too free and happy, but there are still many young people in China suffering in hell. We must march towards Jiangnan and rescue them. In his speech, the Shanghai student representative said: After seeing the relationship between the army and the people in the liberated areas, he is even more convinced that the liberation war is the people's own cause. The student representative from Beiping reported on the process of Tsinghua and Yenching Universities before and after liberation, and the recent upsurge in learning. The representative of Tsinghua University also reported on the plan to revise the "education system". Finally, everyone sang together, and the singing troupe of the Second Division of North China University sang and performed "Husband and Wife Learn to Read" to add to the fun.

　　欢迎平沪苏杭学生代表
  　华北大学举行联欢晚会
    【本报讯】华北大学欢迎平、沪、苏、杭参加全国学联的二十几位代表，于上月二十五日，举行盛大欢迎晚会。出席者有华大副校长范文澜，教授何干之及华大学生代表百余人。开会时，首先由主席李新同志致辞，略称：我们先向不辞劳苦而来的平、沪、苏、杭的代表们表示欢迎。过去的日子里，国民党反动派把我们长期的隔绝着，但是，由于人民的胜利，我们已把这道长城冲破了，我们已胜利的聚会了。范副校长在讲话中指出：来参加学联的各地代表，是代表着全中国广大青年的，他们来了，也就和千千万万的青年来了一样。范副校长最后强调指出：为了把革命进行到底，为了取得新民主主义建设的胜利，我们应当加强理论学习，用毛泽东思想武装我们的头脑，这样我们才能永远是胜利的。
    上海中学教师界代表讲话时，以解放区的教育和蒋管区的教育做了鲜明的对比，他说：我在石家庄参观了几所中学，使我非常感动和兴奋，我看到他们都非常健康而愉快，他们的成绩是采取民主评定的方式；蒋管区呢，饭吃不饱，得肺病的学生太多了，还得强制受军训。今天解放区的学生是太自由幸福了，可是中国还有很多青年仍在地狱里受罪，我们要向江南进军救出他们。上海学生代表在讲话中说：看到解放区的军民关系后，使他更坚信解放战争是人民自己的事业。北平学生代表，报告了清华、燕京两校解放前后的经过，和近来学习的高涨情绪。清华大学代表并报告了修改“教育制度”的计划。最后全体合唱了歌，并由华大二部歌咏团歌唱及演出“夫妻识字”助兴。
