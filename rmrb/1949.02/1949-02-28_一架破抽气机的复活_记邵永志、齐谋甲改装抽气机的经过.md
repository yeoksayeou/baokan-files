The Revival of a Broken Vacuum Pump
  A Record of Shao Yongzhi and Qi Moujia's Modification of the Vacuum Pump
    Night fell, and everything was immersed in silence, except for the light that still shone from the laboratory, and the intermittent sound of hammering. This was where comrades Shao Yongzhi and Qi Moujia were still studying how to改造 the only old hand-cranked vacuum pump in the Anti-Epidemic Department to meet the current urgent needs.
    Shao Yongzhi, a carpenter worker with no mechanical skills, and Qi Moujia, a seventeen-year-old (technical class student), two outsiders, without tools or raw materials, actually wanted to complete such a difficult task. Indeed, many people worried about them.
    But everyone understood: The health of the people and soldiers of North China and the work of the Anti-Epidemic Department urgently needed vacuum pumps. Because it was already spring, the manufactured semi-vaccine needed to be quickly packaged and sent out. According to letters from various places, smallpox had been found in many places and was continuing to spread. The Anti-Epidemic Department had also anxiously gone to Shijiazhuang and Huolu Pharmaceutical Factories to repair the vacuum pumps, but all were disappointing. Manual sealing, with comrades Ma Yunxian and Wang Fuxiang's highest record, could only seal 600 branches per person per day (calculated as six hours). Under the task of supplying the people of the entire North China with cowpox vaccine, this could not solve the problem. Here they were anxiously unable to package, and there smallpox was spreading. "It's really worrying!" Anxious emotions for the work were prevalent in the technical class. However, after fifteen days of research and hard work, and after sixty-five times of disassembly and reassembly, comrades Shao Yongzhi and Qi Moujia finally used indigenous methods and local materials to solve this problem. The amazing news of the success announced on January 24 quickly dispelled all the worries. The comrades in the vaccine department happily carried out all the preparations before packaging. Five people packaged 16,000 branches in two hours, increasing efficiency by sixteen times. Due to their creativity and such a great contribution to the people, they were honorably named People's Heroes through democratic evaluation.
    They remembered very clearly that when they first came into contact with this work on December 9, the first problem they found was that the hand-cranked power was small and the wheel rotation speed was too slow. The speed of the pumping rod's (they didn't know the name of the part, so assuming it was the pumping rod) up and down movement could not meet the requirements. So, they imitated the form of a cotton gin and made a wooden frame, transforming it into a foot-operated wheel. They added a hand crank to the large wheel, one person pedaled, and one person cranked. The large wheel drove the small wheel, and the speed increased several times. The pumping rod was already shuttling up and down quickly.
    "It can pump a little air now." Qi Moujia touched the lower air valve (the name of the air valve is assumed), turned to look at Lao Shao and said. The initial success increased their interest in research. The lights-out bell had rung a long time ago, but the results of repeated disassembly, reassembly, and testing still hadn't cleared up the doubts. Until the lamp oil ran out, they both fell silent. Lao Shao finally sighed and broke the silence: "We can't figure it out today, let's go back and rest and think about it!" That's how the first day was spent.
    At four o'clock in the morning, Lao Shao woke up early and found it difficult to fall asleep: "Why exactly? Why can't it pump?" Suddenly, he thought: "If the expansion ring (the name of the expansion ring is assumed) at the lower end of the pumping rod was expanded more, would it be able to pump more air?!" The more he thought about it, the more he felt it was right. At this time, he couldn't wait to go to the laboratory to experiment. He finally waited until dawn, got out of bed, and found Qi Moujia. He anxiously asked with a happy mood: "Didn't you say to think about it yesterday!? What did you think of!?" He didn't expect to give him a surprising answer.
    "I did think of something, but I don't know if it's right? I want to pad the expansion ring at the lower end of the pumping rod higher, what do you think?"
    The answer made Lao Shao excitedly shout: "Good! That's exactly what it is!" After saying that, he pulled Xiao Qi and strode towards the laboratory. The result of the experiment made them very satisfied. Adding a layer of tinplate under the expansion ring was quite effective, two pieces, three pieces, each additional piece had an effect. It increased to four pieces, reaching the highest degree, but it couldn't solve all the problems. They discovered that the reason why it couldn't pump to a vacuum was also because the piston was rusty. So, they began to remove the rust and make the rust marks smooth. In order to tightly seal the piston, they also put on a leather plug. This achieved a tightness that could not be achieved when metals touched each other.
    Ten days passed, and most of the time was spent on removing rust and polishing. They couldn't reach into the pumping cylinder with their hands, and they didn't have any tools, but they had to remove the rust and polish it. They removed the steel tip from their usual wood drill. They replaced it with a brick that was ground to the same thickness as the pumping cylinder and connected it to the drill handle. By twisting the drill handle, they began to rub inside. Although it was as clumsy as grinding an embroidery needle with a house beam. But the rust and marks on the piston had been completely removed after six days of effort, and everything was entrusted to tomorrow's experiment.
    In the morning, without prior agreement, the two arrived at the laboratory at four o'clock. The dirty room, which hadn't been cleaned for ten days, was cleaned in half an hour. The machine and parts were also placed in a more orderly manner. "Everything is ready..." Lao Shao was holding his last hope today, and his heart beat even harder when assembling the device than usual. Lao Shao pedaled, Xiao Qi cranked, and as a result, it could be filled to two-thirds, which was double what it was before, but it still didn't reach a vacuum. Lao Shao, who had been up early and gone to bed late for eleven days, even staying up all night, racking his brains and exhausting himself, was given a heavy blow as a result. He leaned against the wheel without moving. Xiao Qi wiped the sweat from his forehead, and neither of them said a word. This silence lasted for ten minutes. It wasn't until Director Weng arrived that he broke the silence: "...The spirit of getting to the bottom of things is very good, I agree with you to continue working on it. You haven't delayed your work before, but have made progress. But you are too tired, you must rest for two days no matter what." They repeatedly assembled and disassembled, and measured the machine parts, as if they had found a secret.
    On the 22nd (the thirteenth day), Lao Shao went to the woodworking room to spin a piece of wood, constantly comparing it with a ruler. Qi Moujia hurriedly looked for Lao Shao to discuss, and saw him spinning a piece of wood. He asked in surprise: "Do you want to install it in the pumping cylinder? Have you compared the size? It must be six British minutes, this time I have found its old problem." Lao Shao nodded straight away: "Yesterday I measured that the pumping rod and the pumping cylinder were six British minutes apart. They can't be tightly sealed, this is a gap with air. Wouldn't it be able to be tightly sealed by pasting a piece of wood? So you also discovered this problem, good! Good good! ... I admire you, Xiao Qi is really a genius, really smart." Xiao Qi raised his eyebrows and smiled.
    On the afternoon of the 24th, the wood piece was finally successfully configured, and the final assembly was done. The wheel started to move, the pumping rod shuttled up and down, and before long, it reached a vacuum, and the capillary tube could be filled.
    In this way, our North China Anti-Epidemic Department can quickly send out batches of cowpox vaccine one after another.
    Lao Shao became lively again, sweeping away the worried and frowning expression. The little old man, Comrade Qi Moujia, also kept smiling. Someone asked: "Have you studied mechanics, otherwise how could you have made such great achievements?" Their answer was very simple: "The reason why we can succeed is because of the leadership of the superiors and personal ingenuity. As long as you use your ingenuity, there is nothing that cannot be done!" (North China Anti-Epidemic Department Zhao Shikun)

　　一架破抽气机的复活
  　记邵永志、齐谋甲改装抽气机的经过
    夜深了，一切都沉浸在寂静里，唯研究室内还透出了灯光，断断续续地传出榔头的敲打声。这是邵永志、齐谋甲两同志，还在那里钻研如何改造防疫处仅有的一架破旧手摇抽气机以应目前迫切的需要。
    这个没有机械技术的木匠工人邵永志和一个十七岁的齐谋甲（技术班学员），两个门外汉，既无工具，又无原料，而竟想完成这样一个艰难的工作，的确，有不少的人替他们担心。
    可是谁都懂得：华北军民的健康与防疫处的工作，是迫切的需要抽气机的。因为现在已是春季了，该把制成了的半痘苗，火速装好发出去的，据各方来信许多地方已发现了天花，且在继续蔓延着，防疫处也曾经着急的去石家庄、获鹿药厂修理抽气机，都使人失望了。手工封装，以马云仙、王福祥同志的最高记录，每人每天（六小时计）也只能封六百枝，在供应全华北人民牛痘苗的任务下面，是解决不了问题的。这里干着急装不上，那里天花在流行着。“真愁人！”为工作焦心的情绪普遍在技术班里流行。但是邵永志、齐谋甲两同志经十五天的研究与苦干，经六十五次的拆卸与按装，终于用土办法、土原料，解决了这一问题，当一月二十四日宣告成功的惊人消息，很快驱散了所有的愁容，疫苗科的同志们，高兴地进行了封装前的一切工作，五个人在二小时内装完了一万六千枝，提高了十六倍的效率。由于他们的创造性，对人民如此大的贡献，依民主评定，他俩光荣地做了人民的功臣。
    他们记得很清，当十二月的九日开始接触这一工作时，发现的第一问题，是手摇力量小，轮旋速度太慢。使抽气杆（他们不懂得机件名称假定做抽气杆）上下运动的速度达不到要求。遂模仿轧棉机的形式做了个木架，改造成脚登轮，在大轮上又加了一个手摇把，一人登，一人摇，大轮子带小轮子，速度增加了几倍，抽气杆已飞快地上下穿梭。
    “能抽点气了。”齐谋甲摸了摸下边的气门（气门名称是假定的），转脸对老邵说，初步的成绩，更增加了对研究的兴趣，熄灯钟已响过了很久，反复拆卸按装试验的结果，疑案仍未弄清。直到灯油干了，他俩都沉默起来。还是老邵长吁了一口气，打破了沉寂：“今天研究不透了，回去休息想想吧！”第一天就这样消磨的。
    早晨四点钟，老邵早就醒来，难以入睡了：“究竟为什么？为什么还不能抽？”忽然又想到：“抽汽杆下端的胀圈（胀圈名假定的）是否膨胀的程度再大些就能多抽气？！”越想越对，这时，恨不得马上到研究室试验一番。好容易熬到了天明，爬起床，找着齐谋甲了，他带着愉快的心情急问：“昨天不说想想看吗！？你想的怎样！？”他没想到能给他以令人惊喜的回答。
    “倒想出了一点，不知对不对？我想把抽气杆下端的胀圈垫高些，你看怎样？”
    回答使老邵高兴的叫起来：“好！就是那么个事！”说罢，扯着小齐大步地奔向研究室。试验的结果，使他俩非常满意。胀圈的下面垫一层洋铁片颇有效力，两片、三片，增加一片就有一片的效果。增至四片，到最高程度了，但不能解决全部问题。发觉所以不能抽到真空，还由于活塞周围生锈了，于是开始了去锈，并使锈的斑纹滑润。为严密活塞起见，还套上一块皮塞。这样就做到金属互相接触时所做不到的严密了。
    十天了，大部时间消逝在去锈磨光这个工作上，抽气桶不能伸进手去，没有工具，可是定要去锈和磨光。他们把他惯用的木钻，去掉钢尖。换上一块磨的与抽气桶粗细相等的砖头，和钻柄衔接在一起。这样扭转钻柄，即开始在里边磨擦起来。虽然笨得象以房梁磨绣针。但活塞的锈与斑纹，经六天的努力，已尽数排除，一切寄托在明天的试验中。
    早晨，不约而同，俩人到研究室时才敲四点钟。十天不整理的脏屋子，半点钟后，打扫清洁了。机子与零件也放规矩了些。“都准备好了………。”老邵今天是怀着最后的希望的，按装器件时心中比往日跳动的更厉害。老邵登，小齐摇，结果能装进三分之二，比以前又增加了一倍，仍没有抽到真空。十一天的老邵，早起晚睡，甚至熬通夜，绞尽了脑汁，筋疲力尽，结果，却给了他一个沉重的打击。他倚着轮子一动也不动。小齐揩拭着头上的汗珠，谁也不说一句话。这样沉寂了十分钟。直到翁主任来了才打破了这沉默的情景：“……搞到底的精神很好，同意你们搞下去，以前你们并没有误工，而是有成绩的。可是你们已太疲劳了，无论如何要休息两天。”他们反复的装卸，测量机件，好象找到了一个秘密。
    二十二日（第十三天）老邵去木工室旋一块木片，不断的用尺比比。齐谋甲匆忙的找老邵研究，看见他在旋木片，惊奇的问：“是否想装在抽汽筒里？比尺寸了没有？必须六英分，这一回我可找着它的老毛病了。”老邵听着直点头：“昨天我量了抽气杆与抽气桶差六英分。不能密合，这是有气的空隙。贴上一块木片不就可以密合了吗？原来你也发现了这个问题，好！好好好！……我算佩服你，小齐真天才，真聪明”。小齐挑起眼皮来，笑了笑。
    二十四日的下午木片才配置成功，做最后一次的按装。轮子动起来，抽气杆上下飞穿着，不大会，达到了真空，毛细管可以装满了。
    就这样，使我华北防疫处能迅速的一批顶一批的将牛痘苗发出去。
    老邵又变得活泼起来，扫清了愁眉锁眼的神情，小老头齐谋甲同志也笑个不止。有人问：“你们是不是学过机械，不然怎能有这么大成绩？”他们的回答很简单：“我们能成功原因，是靠上级领导，和个人的使心眼。只要使心眼没有不成的事！”（华北防疫处　赵石琨）
