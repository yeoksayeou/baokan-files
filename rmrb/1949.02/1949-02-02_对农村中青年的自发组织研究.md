　　Research on Spontaneous Organizations of Rural Youth and Middle-aged People
　　Xiao Yemu
　　Based on surveys of youth life in villages such as Majiazhai, Lujiazhuang, and Dongmatou in Ding County, and Fangtaikou Village in Fuping County, a common characteristic emerges: whether in the past or present, and regardless of whether the youth have separate organizations and leadership, young people always have their own organizations and activities. The forms and content of these activities are diverse and very rich. For example, in Lujiazhuang, investigations were conducted on eight spontaneous youth organizations:

　　"Ning Laohu Group," consisting of three people: Ning Laohu, a poor peasant, 23 years old; Jing Xishan, a poor peasant, 26 years old (both are militiamen); Yang Jihe, a middle peasant, 26 years old. Their families all live in the west of the village, and they have been playing together since childhood, with good feelings for each other. Their fathers and brothers also get along well. Ning Laohu can play the qin (a Chinese zither), and the other two sing songs. They help each other during the busy farming season, without keeping track of work points, and there are no other rules.

　　"Duan Yuanfu Group," consisting of two people: Duan Yuanfu, a poor peasant, 22 years old; Guo Hanru, a poor peasant, 21 years old. They help each other during the busy farming season and hunt ducks and yellow weasels together in the winter, earning a considerable income. The leader who guides them in this is Jing Wuyue, 48 years old, a poor peasant, the former director of the village labor union before land redistribution, and now the representative of the poor peasant association. This person is very patient, talks and laughs easily, and likes to be with young people.

　　"Geng Bingsheng Group," consisting of three people: Geng Bingsheng, a middle peasant, a veteran; Wang Hecheng and Li Bingcheng, both 21 years old, both poor peasants. Usually, the three of them work together, without keeping track of work points for each other. Last winter, they learned abacus together. There was a Wang Locai in the village who was very good at using the abacus, so they invited him to be their teacher. They studied every night, and everyone shared the cost of lamp oil. In one winter, they learned "Nine Returns Frame," "Nine Returns Nine Divisions," and "Jin Cheng Liang" (units of measurement)... They also read miscellaneous books and songbooks. They learned faster than in winter schools and literacy classes.

　　"Guo Genger Group," consisting of more than ten people, including Guo Genger, Guo Lianshui, Lao Beigua, Guo Zhener, Guo Luodan... all young people around fifteen or sixteen years old. Every day after lunch, they gather together to practice flower boxing, bending over, kicking legs... very diligently. Except during the busy farming season, they continue throughout the four seasons. They gather quickly and arrive on time; there is no need to call them or use a loudspeaker to urge them. The boxing instructor is Guo Erchou, a poor peasant, 45 years old this year. When practicing boxing, many elderly and middle-aged people often surround them to watch, including the youth's fathers and brothers. The discipline of learning boxing is very strict, and if a punch is done poorly, the instructor will glare. Even so, the young people are still willing to learn, and the old people are satisfied because the young people are so engrossed in practicing boxing that they are constantly thinking about boxing techniques, leaving them no time for eating, drinking, or loafing around.

　　The other four groups are engaged in fishing, rabbit hunting, collecting medicinal herbs... and occasionally stealing melons and peaches, but not regularly.

　　These natural youth organizations are not only for young men, but also for young women. For example, in Dongmatou and other villages in Ding County, young women spin and weave, three in a group or four in a cluster, together all day long. These spontaneous youth organizations are not only found in mountainous areas but also in plains, and they are very common. For example, in Majiazhai in Ding County, there are a total of 222 young people (104 males and 118 females), and there are more than 40 types of spontaneous youth organizations. Furthermore, this has a long history, with only 42 young people not participating.

　　These spontaneous organizations of youth and adolescents generally have the following characteristics:

　　1. They are completely conscious and voluntary, very natural, with no hint of compulsion. Moreover, they are all people with similar interests and ages who come together. In the words of the masses, "Hunchbacks find big bellies, birds of a feather flock together."

　　2. The activities they engage in are all things that young people find interesting: production, boxing, hunting, singing, learning writing and art, shooting... etc.

　　3. They all have naturally formed leaders. Some of the actual leaders are middle-aged or elderly, such as martial arts teachers, abacus teachers, hunting commanders... This is because young people, relying solely on their own abilities and knowledge, are unable to accomplish many things and need guidance from people who have credibility among young people.

　　4. These youth organizations are based on the family as a unit and production as the center, and their activities and content change with the changing seasons of production. Their interests are consistent with the interests of their families and the youth themselves. Therefore, parents mostly do not interfere but give them support.

　　Therefore, these youth organizations have great appeal to young people. Some seem to be even superior to our led and organized civil schools, literacy classes, troupes... They solve some problems that we cannot easily solve (such as quick assembly, conscious adherence to discipline, etc.).

　　The above situation should give us great inspiration: In the past, some comrades who worked in youth work thought that youth work had no content and was not much different from work with the elderly and middle-aged. This is because we do not understand the situation of young people. Sometimes the things we do are incompatible with young people, are superficial, and even make young people feel burdened. Therefore, we must understand the daily life of rural youth and adolescents, understand what they are doing in their daily lives, carefully study these natural organizations of youth, absorb their essence to enrich the content of our youth work, and improve our working methods. And make these youth organizations be transformed and improved.

### 对农村中青年的自发组织研究

　　对农村中青年的自发组织研究
    萧也牧
    根据定县马家寨、吕家庄、东马头以及阜平县方台口等村的青年生活调查，看出一个共同特点：那就是不论是过去和现在，也不论是青年有没有单独的组织和领导，青年们总是有着自己的组织和活动，而这种活动的形式和内容，则是多种多样的，非常丰富的。例如在吕家庄，一共进行了八个自发的青年的组织调查：
    “宁老虎组”，共三人：宁老虎，贫农，二十三岁。景喜山，贫农，二十六岁（他俩都是民兵）。杨计和，中农，二十六岁。他三家都住在村西，他们从小就在一块儿玩，感情很好，他们的父兄，平时也很合得来。宁老虎会弹琴，其余两人就唱曲儿。农忙时互相帮忙，也不记工，也没有旁的章程。
    “段元富组”，共二人：段元富，贫农，二十二岁。郭汉如，贫农，二十一岁。农忙时互相帮忙，冬天伙着打水鸭子、打黄鼬，收入不小。领导他们干这一手的是景五月，四十八岁，贫农，平分前的村工会主任，平分后任贫农团代表。这人很有耐心，有说有笑，好和青年人在一块儿。
    “耿秉生组”，共三人：耿秉生，中农，退伍军人。王合成、李秉成都是二十一岁，都是贫农。平时三人伙着做活，谁也不给谁记工。去年冬天伙着学珠算。村里有个王洛才，一手好算盘，就请他当老师，每天晚上学，灯油大家摊。一冬天学会了“九归架子”、“九归九除”、“斤成两”………也看杂书和唱本。比冬学和识字班还学的快。
    “郭庚儿组”，一共十多个人，有郭庚儿、郭连水、老北瓜、郭珍儿、郭洛旦………都是十五六岁的小青年，每天吃过下午饭，集在一块儿学花拳，弯腰、弹腿………十分紧张。除了农忙时节，四季不断。集合很快，到的也齐；不用去叫，也不用广播筒子摧。拳教师是郭二丑，贫农，今年四十五岁。练拳的时候，常有很多老年壮年围着参观，里边就有青年们的父兄。学拳纪律很严，打差了一拳，教师就要瞪眼。就这样、青年们还是愿意学，老人们也满意，因为青年们练拳入了迷，有空就结记着拳脚的事，顾不的去干吃喝浪荡的事了。
    旁的四组，有打鱼的、有叉兔子的、有采药材的……也有伙着偷瓜摘桃的，但不经常，是偶然的。
    这种青年的自然的组织，不光男青年有，女青年也有。如定县东马头等村子里的青年妇女，插着纺花织布，三个一伙四个一堆的、成天在一起。这种青年的自发的组织，不光是山地有，平原也有，而且很普遍。例如定县马家寨，全村共有二百二十二个青年（男一百零四个、女一百一十八个），青年的自发的组织，就有四十多种以上，而且历史很长。没参加的青年仅四十二人。
    这些青少年的自发的组织一般的有如下几个特点：
    一、完全是自觉自愿的，自然得很，丝毫没有强迫的味道。而且都是兴趣相投，年龄相仿的人才凑在一起，用群众的话来说叫做：“罗锅（驼背）找大肚，一伙找一伙。”
    二、进行的活动都是青少年感到有兴趣的事：生产、打拳、行猎、唱曲、学字艺、射击……等。
    三、都有自然形成的领袖，有的实际上的领导者是壮年或老年，如教武术的教师、教珠算的老先生、打猎的指挥者……这是由于青少年光凭自己的能力与知识还有很多事作不成，需要在青年中有威信的人来指导。
    四、这些青年的组织，都是以家庭为单位，以生产为中心，并且以生产季节的变化来改变它的活动方法和内容。与其家庭利益和青年的本身利益是一致的。所以家长多不干涉，而给以赞助。
    因此这些青少年的组织对青年的吸引力很大，有些比我们有领导有组织的民校、识字班，剧团……似乎还显得优越，解决了某些我们不易解决的问题（如集合快、自觉的遵守纪律等）。
    以上的情形应该给我们很大的启示：过去我们有些作青年工作的同志，认为青年工作没内容；和壮老年没多大的区别，这都是由于我们不了解青年的情况，有时我们搞的一套和青年格格不入，流于形式，甚至使青年们感到是一种“负担”。所以我们必须要了解农村青少年日常生活状况，了解他们在日常生活中在干些什么？要仔细研究这种青年的自然组织，吸取其中的精华，来充实我们青年工作的内容，改进工作的方法。并且使这种青年的组织得到改造和提高。
