　　Thakin Nu's Government – Thakin Nu was originally the vice-chairman of the "Freedom League" of Burma (the Anti-Fascist People's Freedom League during the anti-Japanese period), representing the big landlords and big bureaucrat-capitalists of Burma, and also a reactionary representing the interests of British imperialism. After the end of the Anti-Japanese War, the people of Burma demanded independence from British oppression and held negotiations with Britain in January 1946. The negotiations fully exposed Britain's lack of sincerity in giving Burma genuine independence. Therefore, this hypocritical negotiation by Britain was strongly opposed by the Burmese Communist Party and Burmese democrats. However, Britain's ambition to rule Burma did not disappear, so on November 17, 1947, it found its agent, Thakin Nu, and formally signed the so-called "Independence Treaty." On January 4, 1948, Thakin Nu, this lackey, announced the formation of a puppet government and, under the instructions of British imperialism, began a military "encirclement and suppression" of the Burmese people.
