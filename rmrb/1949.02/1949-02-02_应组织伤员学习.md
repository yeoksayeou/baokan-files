　　Wounded Soldiers Should Be Organized to Study
    In the context of the rapid development of the national situation, how to help the sick and wounded comrades lying in bed to study is indeed a question worth studying. The sick and wounded comrades generally have a very enthusiastic desire to study. For example, comrades Wu Xuying and Feng Lianke in a certain unit are both lying in bed and cannot get up, only able to stretch out their arms. Feng Lianke was illiterate and felt difficulties in his previous work. This time when he came to the hospital, he was thinking that he must study hard this time, so when his injury was slightly lighter, he took out his study book and asked the literate comrades to teach him how to write. Comrade Wu Xuying knew how to write documents, so he became his teacher. But there are many other wounded soldiers who are not like this. Although their injuries are not serious and they can study, they waste their time casually. It is hoped that all relevant units should pay attention to guiding the wounded and sick soldiers who can study, in order to improve their cultural and political level. I would like to make a few suggestions: First, the leadership should organize a certain number of people to go to the wards to explain to the wounded and sick soldiers that, due to the rapid development of the situation, the Kuomintang can be fundamentally defeated and victory achieved nationwide in about a year. If you do not study, you will not be able to keep up with the needs of the times. Second, the leadership should immediately improve the study organization, and compile many important things published in our newspapers into allegro and other forms to publicize to everyone. Third, try to buy some popular and simple publications to help with study, and also form a mobile library to rotate in the wards, so that the pain of some wounded and sick soldiers who have no books to read can be solved. Fourth, attention should be paid to cultural learning, even if only a few new characters are learned every day. In addition to the assistance of the organization and leadership, wounded and sick soldiers in each ward can also be mobilized to help each other study.

　　应组织伤员学习
    在全国形势急速发展的情形下，如何帮助躺在床上的伤病员学习，确实是一个值得研究的问题。伤病员同志一般要求学习的情绪都很热烈，如某所毋绪英和冯连科二同志，都躺在床上不能起来，只能伸出两只胳膊。冯连科不认字，从前在工作中时，就感到困难。这次来住医院，心里就想着这次可得好好学习了，所以他在伤稍轻一点时，就拿出学习本让认字的同志教他写。毋绪英同志会作文书，于是便成了他的先生。但另有许多伤员就不如此，虽是伤已不重，可以学习，但随随便便就把时间浪费了。希望各个有关单位，应该注意领导能学习的伤病员学习，以提高他们的文化政治水平。我愿意提出几点建议：一、领导上组织一定的人到病房去，向伤病员讲明，由于形势的迅速发展，只要有一年左右就可以从根本上打垮国民党，在全国胜利。若不学习，便会赶不上时局的需要。二、领导上要立即健全学习的组织，并将咱们的报纸上所发表的许多重要事情，编成快板等形式向大家宣传。三、尽可能买些通俗简单的刊物来帮助学习，还可组成流动图书馆，在病房轮转，这样可使有些伤病员没有书看的痛苦便解决了。四、应注意文化学习，每天只学几个生字也可以。除了组织领导上协助外，还可以发动各病房伤病员互相帮助学习。
