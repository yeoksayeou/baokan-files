　　Jianping Elementary School Teachers
  　Study Current Events to Improve Understanding
    The current events study of teachers in Jianping County's senior elementary schools has now gained some momentum. On January 23rd, when all the county's complete primary school principals and teachers held a meeting, everyone recognized the importance of current events study for elementary school students and local people. They organized to study Chairman Mao's New Year's Day message. The method was to first test everyone with the following questions: What is your understanding of Chiang Kai-shek's proposal for "peace talks"? Why did he propose "peace talks"? What influence does the United States' policy toward China have on Chiang Kai-shek's "peace talks"? What attitude should we take toward peace talks? After everyone answered, discussions were held, and finally, Wang Zhitin, the head of the county party committee's propaganda department, gave a concluding report. He pointed out the conspiracy of the US and Chiang to instigate "peace talks," and explained that the revolution must be carried through to the end. Through this study, the teachers' thinking is now clearer than in the past, and the effect of current events propaganda is significant.

　　建屏小学教员
  　学习时事提高认识
    建屏县高小教师的学习现已得到一些推动。一月二十三日全县完小校长教员开会时，大家认识了教员的时事学习对于小学生和老乡的重要，便组织起来学习毛主席新年献词。方式是先测验，题目是：你对蒋介石提出“和平谈判”怎样认识？他为什么提出“和平谈判”？美国对华政策对蒋介石“和平谈判”有什么影响？我们对和平谈判应抱什么态度？在大家解答以后，然后再进行讨论，最后由县委宣传部长王植庭作总结报告。指出美蒋策动“和平谈判”的阴谋，说明必须革命到底。经过这次学习，教员思想已较过去明确，对时事宣传作用很大。
