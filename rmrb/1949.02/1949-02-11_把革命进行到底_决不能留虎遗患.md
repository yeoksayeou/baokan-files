　　Carry the Revolution Through to the End
  　Absolutely Do Not Leave the Tiger a Future Threat
    Yang Buhao, a labor hero from Yan'an County, began by recounting a conversation he had with Chairman Mao in the year of Japan's surrender. After returning from the Chongqing negotiations, Chairman Mao told him, when he visited to inquire about news of peace, that after peace was achieved, the common people could focus on production. Yang Buhao said: The people were very happy to hear Chairman Mao's words. But less than three months had passed before the Kuomintang started the civil war again. The Kuomintang is being defeated and is nearly finished, but now they want to seek peace. We no longer believe in the Kuomintang. We fully support the eight conditions put forward by Chairman Mao, unite, produce well, support the front lines, and carry the revolution through to the end.
    Mr. Li Zhongren, a people's representative from the Guanzhong sub-region and a member of the Shaanxi-Gansu-Ningxia Border Region People's Government, angrily denounced the various atrocities committed by the Kuomintang bandit troops since their attack on the Guanzhong sub-region in 1946. Five of Mr. Li's family members were also murdered by the bandit troops. He said that in Malanchuan in Xinzheng (newly established county), the eight villages in the third district of Chishui (newly established county), and Zhaojin and Shipo in Chunyao (newly established county), houses were burned, grain was looted, and chickens and dogs were killed. In the border areas of Chishui County alone, more than one hundred people were killed and more than three hundred households were forced to flee to other places. He said: Killing Chiang Kai-shek alone cannot vent the people's hatred. We should be harsh and show no mercy to all war criminals. Wherever they flee, we must pursue them, arrest them, and bring them to justice. Another people's representative from the Guanzhong sub-region and permanent member of the Shaanxi-Gansu-Ningxia Border Region Senate, Mr. Fang Wenli, said: We must not be fooled by Chiang Kai-shek's peace conspiracies. We must never let the tiger return to the mountain after it has been beaten down and is near death, nor cultivate forests and raise tigers to harm people again.
    Dong Nianli, representing the Shaanxi-Gansu-Ningxia Border Region Youth Federation, and Lu Ziliang, deputy director of the Women's Federation, spoke on behalf of the youth and women, respectively, expressing their full support for Chairman Mao's statement on the current situation and vowing to carry the revolution through to the end. Lu Ziliang said: The second women's representative conference of the border region is currently being held. Women representatives from Longdong reported that most of the women in Qingyang City were raped by Ma Bufang's bandit troops. There were also not a few women in other parts of the border region who were raped by Kuomintang bandit troops. We must take revenge. War criminals must be caught, and women must send representatives to try them.
    Ke Zhongping, director of the Shaanxi-Gansu-Ningxia Border Region Cultural Association, said: Now is the time for us to settle the general account with the Kuomintang reactionaries. We support carrying the revolution through to the end. We must avenge the young writers and democratic fighters who were murdered by the Kuomintang reactionaries.
    Qi Haitian, a member of the Shaanxi-Gansu-Ningxia Border Region Ethnic Minorities Committee and a Mongolian representative, and Da Wudai, a Hui youth who had just come from Xi'an, also spoke at the meeting. Da Wudai reported the resentment of the Hui people in Xi'an towards Chiang Kai-shek's New Year's Day message. He said: Chiang Kai-shek wants to maintain the pseudo-constitution, but the pseudo-constitution does not recognize our Hui people as a nation. Our Hui people resolutely oppose this false peace that wants to maintain the pseudo-constitution.
    In addition, Li Furen, president of Yan'an University, Cao Fangru, deputy secretary-general of the Northwest Central Bureau of the CCP, Huo Zhusan, senator of the Shaanxi-Gansu-Ningxia Border Region Senate, An Wenqin, vice-president of the Senate, Jiang Dengxiao, Hui senator, He Liancheng, director of the Education Department of the Border Region People's Government, Hu Jingduo, commander of the Sixth Cavalry Division of the Northwest People's Liberation Army, and Yang Xiaochu, former director of the Finance Department of the Kuomintang Shaanxi Provincial Government, also spoke at the symposium. They all expressed their firm support for Chairman Mao's eight peace conditions, the punishment of war criminals, and carrying the revolution through to the end.
    Li Zhuoran, head of the Propaganda Department of the Northwest Central Bureau of the CCP, delivered the final speech at the meeting. He emphasized that the eight conditions for peace proposed by Chairman Mao were completely consistent with the spirit of the New Year's Day editorial of the Xinhua News Agency, "Carry the Revolution Through to the End." He said: "Carrying the revolution through to the end means driving the aggressive forces of American imperialism out of China! It means ending the reactionary rule of the Kuomintang and completely liberating all of China! Chairman Mao's eight conditions for peace are the true democratic peace banner representing the will of all the Chinese people. If the Kuomintang does not accept them, it will expose their so-called 'peace' as false. Now, according to the Communist Party's peace conditions, the Beijing issue has been resolved peacefully. If the Kuomintang reactionary traitorous government and Kuomintang military commanders in various places want to talk about peace, Beijing is an example!"

### 把革命进行到底　决不能留虎遗患

　　把革命进行到底
  　决不能留虎遗患
    延安县劳动英雄杨步浩，在会上首先追述了他在日本投降那年同毛主席的一段谈话。毛主席从重庆和谈回来，他去拜访毛主席探询和平的消息，毛主席告诉他说：以后和平实现了，老百姓可以安心生产了。杨步浩说：听了毛主席的话，老百姓都很高兴。可是三个月还没过，国民党又打起内战来了。国民党打败仗，打得快完蛋了，现在却要来求和，我们再不相信国民党。我们完全拥护毛主席提出的八个条件，团结起来，好好生产支援前线，革命到底。
    关中分区人民代表、陕甘宁边区人民政府委员李仲仁先生，愤怒地控诉了国民党匪军自一九四六年进攻关中分区以来的种种暴行。李先生的家属也有五个人被匪军残杀。他说新正（新设县）马栏川，赤水（新设县）三区八乡，淳耀（新设县）照金、市坡等地房屋被烧光，粮食被抢光，鸡狗被杀光。赤水县边沿地区就被杀死了一百多老百姓，逼走了三百多户人家流落外乡。他说：把蒋介石一个人杀了，还不能泄人民之恨。我们对于一切战犯要不客气、不要怜悯，他们逃到哪里，我们一定要追到哪里把他们缉获归案法办。另一位关中分区人民代表、陕甘宁边区参议会常驻议员房文礼老先生说：蒋介石玩和平阴谋，我们决不要上当。老虎下山被打得快死了，我们决不要放虎归山，栽林养虎，再来伤人。
    陕甘宁边区青年联合会代表董念黎，妇女联合会副主任路子亮等，分别代表青年、妇女在会上发言，表示完全拥护毛主席的时局声明，将革命进行到底。路子亮说：边区第二届妇女代表大会正在举行。陇东的妇女代表报告，庆阳城内的妇女，大部都被马步芳匪军奸污。边区其他地方妇女遭受国民党匪军奸淫的也不在少数。我们一定要报仇，战争罪犯一定要捉来，妇女们要派代表来审判他们。
    陕甘宁边区文化协会主任柯仲平说：现在是我们向国民党反动派算总帐的时候了。我们拥护将革命进行到底。我们要为被国民党反动派残杀的青年作家、民主战士复仇。
    陕甘宁边区少数民族委员会委员、蒙民代表奇海田，以及才从西安来的回民青年达悟呆都在会上讲了话。达悟呆报告了西安回民对于蒋介石元旦文告的反感。他说：蒋介石要维持伪宪法，而伪宪法就不承认我们回族是一个民族。我们回族就坚决反对这种要维持伪宪法的假和平。
    此外，在座谈会上发言的，有延安大学校长李敷仁，中共西北中央局副秘书长曹方如，陕甘宁边区参议会参议员霍祝三，参议会副议长安文钦，回民参议员蒋登霄，边区人民政府教育厅长贺连城，西北人民解放军骑兵第六师师长胡景铎，前国民党陕西省政府财政厅长杨晓初等。他们都表示坚决拥护毛主席的八项和平条件，惩办战争罪犯，将革命进行到底。
    中共西北中央局宣传部长李卓然，在会上最后一个讲话。他着重地指出：毛主席所提和平谈判的八项条件，与新华社元旦社论，“将革命进行到底”的精神是完全一致的。他说：“将革命进行到底，就是要把美国帝国主义的侵略势力赶出中国去！就是要结束国民党反动统治，把全中国完全解放！毛主席的八项和平条件，是代表全中国人民意志的真正的民主和平的旗帜，国民党如果不接受，就暴露他们所叫嚷的‘和平’是假的。现在，按照共产党的和平条件，已经和平地解决了北平问题。国民党反动卖国政府和各地国民党军将领要讲和平，北平就是一个榜样！”
