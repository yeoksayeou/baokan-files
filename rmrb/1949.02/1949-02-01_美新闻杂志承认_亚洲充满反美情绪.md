Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 29th -- TASS, New York: An American news magazine, in an article discussing American policy in Asia, admitted that throughout Asia, from northern China to the Java Sea, there is widespread anti-American sentiment and distrust of the United States. Thoughtful Asians fear that American policy is to support Japan in restoring its capacity to wage war. They resent American measures towards China and "suspect the motives of the United States towards Indonesia, Vietnam, and other colonies that are striving for independence." The news magazine continued: Many Indonesians firmly believe that the United States is "paying lip service to the Indonesian Republic while indirectly aiding the Dutch in controlling Indonesia." Due to the assistance provided to France and the Netherlands by the Marshall Plan, the invaded countries harbor the sentiment that the United States is supporting colonial powers. The news magazine wrote: The same resentment is also widespread among the people of Burma and Malaya.

　　美新闻杂志承认
  　亚洲充满反美情绪
    【新华社陕北二十九日电】塔斯社纽约讯：美国新闻杂志著文论述美国在亚洲的政策时承认：在亚洲，从中国北部到爪哇海，到处都充满着反美情绪和对于美国的不信任。亚洲深思远虑的人们害怕美国的政策是扶植日本以恢复它制造战争的能力。他们愤恨美国的对华措施，而且“怀疑美国对印尼、越南以及其他正在争取独立的殖民地的动机”。新闻杂志继称：许多印尼人坚决认为，美国正在“空谈印尼共和国，而另一方面，却在间接援助荷兰控制印尼”。由于马歇尔计划对法、荷的帮助，被侵略国存在着认为美国是在支持殖民国家的情绪。新闻杂志写道：同样的愤恨也普遍存在于缅甸和马来亚人民中。
