Xinhua News Agency, Tianjin, February 14th: The Tianjin Military Control Commission's Financial Department and the Tianjin Branch of the People's Bank of China completed the work of exchanging counterfeit Gold Yuan notes after 19 days, successfully concluding on the 4th of this month. A total of more than 440 million counterfeit Gold Yuan notes were exchanged, of which more than 150 million were exchanged at preferential rates. The successful completion of this work has played a significant role in clarifying the financial market, stabilizing prices, and stabilizing people's lives.

At the beginning of Tianjin's liberation, the general public, deeply affected by the severe devaluation of counterfeit currency, rushed to get rid of it to purchase goods, which caused a temporary rise in some prices. The Military Control Commission quickly determined the exchange rate between counterfeit Gold Yuan notes and Renminbi, and began exchanging them on January 17th. To facilitate citizens' exchange nearby, 272 exchange points and entrusted exchange points were specially set up in the city, and mobile exchange teams were added to go to remote areas for mobile exchange. In addition, in order to take care of workers, factory employees, farmers, teachers, students, poor civil servants, and urban poor, the Military Control Commission also set a preferential price (3 Gold Yuan notes for 1 Renminbi) and collective exchange methods, with work teams sent to factories, schools, and institutions to notify the banks to send the money to each unit for direct exchange work. The mobile exchange team members went deep into the poor areas, using gongs and drums to call on the poor to exchange, which greatly moved many poor people who believed that the current People's Government was truly different from the Kuomintang in the past, taking care of the convenience of the people everywhere.

At the beginning of this work, some shortcomings occurred, such as insufficient preparation, individual staff members not being proficient enough in their work, unclear division of labor among cadres, and not close enough contact between superiors and subordinates. Some leaders were busy with affairs all day long and did not have a better grasp of the overall situation to promote the overall work. However, these shortcomings were promptly overcome, and the exchange work was successfully completed.

　　津市大力澄清金融市场
  　收兑伪币工作完成
    【新华社天津十四日电】天津市军管会金融处与中国人民银行天津分行收换伪金圆券工作，历时十九天，已于本月四日顺利完成，共兑入伪金圆券四亿四千多万，其中以优待比价收兑一亿五千多万。这一工作的胜利完成，对澄清金融市场，稳定物价，安定人民生活，起了很大的作用。
    津市解放之初，一般市民，因为深受伪币猛烈贬值的痛苦，曾纷纷抛去伪币，购买物资，引起某些物价的一度高涨。军管会乃迅速确定了伪金圆券与人民币的兑换比价，于一月十七日起开始收兑。为便利市民就近兑换，又特在市内设立兑换所与委托代兑所达二百七十二处，并增设流动兑换组分赴各偏僻的区域流动兑换。此外，军管会为照顾工人、工厂职员、农民、教职员、学生、贫苦公务人员及城市贫民，又定出优待价（伪金圆券三元对人民券一元）及集体兑换办法，由派往各工厂、学校、机关的工作组，通知银行将款送到各单位，直接办理兑换工作。流动兑换组人员，更深入贫民区域，以锣鼓来召集贫民兑换，致使很多贫民大为感动，认为现在人民政府真和过去国民党不一样，处处照顾到老百姓的方便。
    这一工作开始时曾发生一些缺点，如准备工作不够充分，个别工作人员对于业务不够熟练，干部分工不够明确，上下联系不够密切，个别领导人员，整天忙于事务，没有更好的掌握整个情况，推动全盘工作。但这些缺点均及时克服，兑换工作得以顺利完成。
