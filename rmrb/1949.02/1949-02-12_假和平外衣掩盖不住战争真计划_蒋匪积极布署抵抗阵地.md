Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 10th. The tattered cloak of false peace can no longer conceal the Kuomintang bandit gang's true plan to continue the war. In South China, Southwest China, Northwest China, and the Nanjing-Shanghai area, the Kuomintang bandit gang is establishing resistance positions under the orders of bandit chief Chiang Kai-shek. Xue Yue, the puppet governor of Guangdong Province, told an Associated Press reporter in Guangzhou on the 2nd that he would establish a "Four-Province Alliance" of Guangdong, Guangxi, Fujian, and Hunan, and would have Song Ziwen seek direct US aid to South China. The puppet Executive Yuan also decided on the 7th to establish the Guilin "Pacification" Headquarters, with Li Jingxian as its director. An Associated Press dispatch from Shanghai on the 6th stated that Kuomintang troops were still constantly flowing to South China and deploying defenses, with some having already arrived in Guangzhou. Zhang Qun, director of the puppet Chongqing Pacification Headquarters, flew to Fenghua to consult with the Chiang bandit and then flew to Chongqing on the 4th to take office. At the same time, the puppet Ministry of National Defense appointed Qian Dajun, another confidant of the Chiang bandit, as the deputy director of the headquarters, to jointly command the military and political affairs of the Southwest with Zhang Qun. Zhang Qun is convening a meeting of the governors of Sichuan, Xikang, Yunnan, and Guizhou provinces. Wang Lingji, the puppet governor of Sichuan Province, flew from Chengdu to Chongqing on the 8th to meet with Zhang Qun and publicly stated that conscription and grain collection in Sichuan Province would continue. Wang Tianming, chief of staff of the puppet Changsha Pacification Headquarters, also recently went to Guiyang to discuss "joint defense" issues with the puppet Guizhou provincial authorities. Zhang Zhizhong, the puppet Northwest Military and Political Administrator, flew to Lanzhou on January 31 and immediately convened a meeting of Ma Hongda, the puppet governor of Ningxia Province, Ma Bufang, the puppet governor of Qinghai Province, Luo Lie, the chief of staff of the puppet Xi'an Pacification Headquarters, Tao Zhiyue, the newly appointed puppet Xinjiang Garrison Commander, and Burhan, the puppet governor of Xinjiang Province, to "discuss the current situation." According to a report by the Kuomintang Central News Agency, the conclusion of the meeting was "to defend the Northwest with the strength of the Northwest." In the Nanjing-Shanghai area, Tang Enbo, the puppet Nanjing-Shanghai-Hangzhou Garrison Commander, is intensifying war preparations on the one hand and trying his best to suppress the local peace movement, declaring the movement "illegal." Other news stated that Tang Enbo's troops are concentrating in the Nanjing-Shanghai area, and the Shanghai West Racecourse has been designated as a defense zone, and the buildings there will be leveled to facilitate the construction of fortifications and serve as a temporary flying field. Xu Yongchang, the puppet Minister of National Defense, Gu Zhutong, the puppet Chief of the General Staff of the Ministry of National Defense, and Tang Enbo, Chen Daqing, and others held a secret military meeting in Shanghai on the 8th. Li Zongren, the puppet acting president, also went to Shanghai at Tang Enbo's invitation to participate. United Press reported that Li "explained in detail at the meeting the need for the army to prepare to resume and continue fighting."

　　假和平外衣掩盖不住战争真计划
  　蒋匪积极布署抵抗阵地
    【新华社陕北十日电】假和平的破外衣已经掩盖不住国民党匪帮继续战争的真计划。在华南、西南、西北和京沪地区，国民党匪帮正在匪首蒋介石命令下分别建立抵抗阵地。伪广东省主席薛岳二日在广州对美联社记者声称将建立粤桂闽湘“四省联盟”，并要宋子文争取美国直接援助华南。伪行政院并于七日决议成立桂林“绥靖”公署，以李晶仙为该署主任。美联社上海六日消息称：国民党军队仍不断向华南流去，并在布防，其中一部分已到达广州。伪重庆绥靖公署主任张群于飞往奉化请示过蒋贼后，已于四日飞抵重庆上任，同时伪国防部又委派蒋贼的另一心腹钱大钧为该署副主任，和张群共同指挥西南军政。张群正在召集川康滇黔四省主席开会，伪四川省主席王陵基八日由成都飞往重庆会见张群，并公开声称，川省征兵征粮将继续进行。伪长沙绥靖公署参谋长王天鸣亦于最近到贵阳与伪贵州省当局商议“联防”问题。伪西北军政长官张治中一月三十一日飞抵兰州后，即赶忙召集伪宁夏省主席马鸿达、伪青海省主席马步芳、伪西安绥靖公署参谋长罗列、伪新疆警备司令陶峙岳新任及伪新疆省主席包尔汉等“集商时局”。据国民党中央社报道说，该会议的结论是“以西北的力量保卫西北”。京沪方面，伪京沪杭警备总司令汤恩伯一方面加紧战争布署，一方面竭力镇压局部和平运动，宣布该运动为“非法”。其他消息称：汤恩伯的军队正向京沪地区集中，上海西跑马场已被指定为防御区，该地建筑物将予以平毁，以便于建筑工事和供作临时习飞机场。伪国防部长徐永昌、伪国防部参谋总长顾祝同和汤恩伯、陈大庆等人曾于八日在沪举行秘密军事会议，伪代总统李宗仁也应汤恩伯电邀赴沪参加，合众社报导说李在会上“曾详细地说明军队准备恢复与继续作战的需要”。
