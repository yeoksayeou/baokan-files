Editor:

I have a question. My father died during the War of Resistance Against Japan (during the Iron Wall Encirclement in the spring of 1942). When the village office calculated the burden for this autumn harvest, they only calculated it based on the current population of my family, after deducting the land. My father himself was not deducted. According to current regulations, should the martyr himself be deducted from the burden? I would appreciate an answer.

Comrade Li Fengyun:

According to Article 12 (1) of the New Agricultural Tax Regulations promulgated by the North China Government, revolutionary soldiers, revolutionary staff, and martyrs should all be deducted from the burden in their own homes. If your father was a martyr (the letter does not state what your father originally did? Whether he is considered a martyr), he himself should be deducted from the burden. You can propose a reasonable solution to the village office. Otherwise, it will be the same as ordinary citizens.

### 烈士是否应扣免征点？

专栏：询问与答复

　　烈士是否应扣免征点？编辑同志：
    现在我有个疑问，我父亲在抗战期间（四二年春铁壁合围时）牺牲了，今年秋征村公所算负担时，扣除土地，只按我家现有人口计算，我父亲本人则不给扣。按现在规定，烈士本人是否应当扣除负担？请解答为盼。
    　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　李风云李风云同志：
    依华北政府公布新农业税则第十二条（一）革命军人、革命职员及烈士均在其本人家中扣除之。你父亲若是烈士的话（来信未说明你父原来干什么？是否算烈士）。本人应当扣除负担，你可向村公所提出合理解决。否则，与一般公民相同。
