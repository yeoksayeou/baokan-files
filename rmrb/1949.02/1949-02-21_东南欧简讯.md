　　Brief News from Southeastern Europe
    ▲Czechoslovakian industry, excluding the food industry, completed 101.8% of the January plan – the first month of the Five-Year Plan. Among them, the steel industry exceeded the plan by 5.4%, the power industry by 2.9%, the chemical industry by 0.9%, and the textile and garment industry by 2.5%.
    ▲As of the end of 1948, there were nearly 3.5 million workers and staff in Czechoslovakia. Among them, 3,073,000 people participated in trade unions, with 963,000 new members joining trade unions last year.
    ▲The Bulgarian railway transportation two-year plan has exceeded 68%. During this period, 140 kilometers of railway track were laid nationwide. The Five-Year Plan stipulates a further 14% increase in railway track laying, so that by the end of 1953, freight transport will increase by 38% compared to 1948, and passenger transport will increase by 28%. Bulgaria currently has three domestic civil aviation routes and one international aviation route. The Five-Year Plan stipulates an increase in domestic aviation route mileage by 146% and an increase in international aviation route mileage by 319%.
    ▲In addition to developing agricultural cooperatives, Bulgaria began establishing state-owned farms at the end of 1947. Currently, Bulgaria has 86 state-owned farms with over 80,000 hectares of cultivated land (one hectare equals 16 Chinese mu). Due to the use of scientific farming methods, the yield per hectare on state-owned farms in 1948 was 30% to 40% higher than that of individual farms (the yield of agricultural cooperative farms was 20% to 25% higher than that of individual farms). The Five-Year Plan stipulates that slightly over 10% of the agricultural department's capital investment will be invested in state-owned farms. By the time the Five-Year Plan is completed, dozens more state-owned farms will be established, with a total cultivated area of 120,000 hectares.
    ▲Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 20th. The Central Committee of the Romanian National People's Party announced on the 15th that it would dissolve the party itself so that its members would have "full opportunities to participate in the great cause of building Romanian socialism." The party was formerly known as the "Patriotic Union," established in January 1946.
