Xinhua News Agency, East China, 22nd — In the past month, over 100,000 liberated farmers in Shandong and Northern Jiangsu enthusiastically joined the People's Liberation Army under the slogan of "Striving for the Complete Victory of the Revolution." In the Lunan area of Central Shandong alone, more than 38,000 people voluntarily enlisted. In the newly recovered areas north of the Yangtze River, over 3,200 people from five counties, including Nantong, Tongru (newly established county between Nantong and Rugao), Haiqi (newly established county between Haimen and Qidong), Taixing, and Jingjiang, joined the PLA. In Tongshan County, which was newly liberated just over a month ago, more than 800 young farmers poured into the ranks of the army. A crucial factor in the success of this large-scale conscription movement was inspiring farmers to speak out about their sufferings and seek revenge, thereby raising the political awareness of the masses. At a conscription rally in Nantong County, Northern Jiangsu, Zhang Changshu, a farmer from Xin jian Township, recounted how he was captured by the Kuomintang bandit army and tortured unconscious five times. The bandits burned him with thatch and scraped him with shrapnel. Wang Jingqing, a farmer from Qiangtian Township, recounted how he was hung up by the mouth with a steelyard hook and brutally beaten by the bandits. These harrowing experiences greatly angered the farmers present, and many shouted with tears in their eyes: "Revenge is at hand!" On the spot, 40 young people signed up to join the army, followed by a surge of sending husbands, sons, and brothers to join the army, totaling more than 780 applicants. Zhao Songdou, an old farmer from Jingzhi Town, Huaian County (newly established county in the northwest of Zhucheng and northeast of Anqiu), Yitian District, Central Shandong, denounced the atrocities of the Kuomintang bandit army at a conscription rally, pointing to his leg, which was crippled by the bandit army, and telling his son, who had signed up to join the army: "Our family was liberated under the leadership of the Communist Party. Go to the front line and do a good job, and avenge me!" Many young and middle-aged men immediately signed up. The leading role of cadres and activists in joining the army also greatly promoted the movement. Zheng Xin, a famous labor hero from Shandong, took the lead in persuading his son to join the army. Five young militiamen from Chajiaxuanluo Village, Taining County (newly established county between Tai'an and Ningyang), collectively signed up to join the army, which played a promoting role in the local conscription movement. In addition, adhering to the principles of fairness and rationality in the conscription movement, appropriately evaluating based on the number of people who had joined the army in the past and the current labor situation, and guaranteeing care for the families of those who joined the army in the mobilization process, also played a significant role in completing the task of mobilizing conscription.

　　华东十余万农民参军
    【新华社华东二十二日电】一月来山东、苏北两地十余万翻身农民，在“争取革命彻底胜利”口号下，热烈参加解放军。其中仅鲁中南一地即有三万八千余人自动参军。长江北岸新收复区的南通、通如（新设县，南通、如皋间）、海启（新设县，海门、启东间）、泰兴、靖江等五县有三千二百多人参加解放军。新解放只月余的铜山县，亦有八百余青年农民涌进参军的行列。启发农民诉苦复仇，提高群众政治觉悟，是这次大规模参军运动获得成功的重要原因之一。苏北南通县参军大会上，新建乡农民张长书诉说自己被国民党匪军抓去，上刑昏过去五次，匪军用茅草烧他，用弹片刮他。抢田乡农民王镜清诉说他被匪军用秤钩钩住嘴吊起来毒打。这些惨痛经历的控诉，使到场农民非常激愤，许多人挥泪高呼：“报仇雪恨，就在今朝！”当时就有四十个青年报名参军，接着就展开送夫、送子、送弟参军的热潮，总计报名参军的有七百八十多名。鲁中南沂田区淮安县（新设县，诸城西北部，安邱东北部）景芝镇老农赵松斗在参军大会上控诉国民党匪军的暴行，指着自己被匪军打残废的腿告诉他的报名参军的儿子说：“咱家是共产党领导才翻了身的，你到前线去好好干，给我报仇！”当场有许多青壮年纷纷报名入伍。干部和积极分子带头参军对运动也有很大的推动作用。山东著名劳动英雄郑信带头劝子参军，泰宁县（新设县，泰安、宁阳间）查家宣落村五个青年民兵集体报名参军，对当地参军运动都起了推动的作用。此外，参军运动中掌握公平合理的原则，根据过去参军人数多少，现有劳力情况，领导群众进行适当的评议，并在动员参军时保证照顾参军者的家庭生产等等，对完成动员参军的任务也有很大作用。
