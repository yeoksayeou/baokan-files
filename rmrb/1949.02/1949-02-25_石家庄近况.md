The People's Liberation Army welcomed 1949 with a great victorious advance; the people of Shijiazhuang, especially the workers of Shijiazhuang, also welcomed 1949 with victories on the production front.

　　New output, new construction, new labor efficiency.

The working people are turning Shijiazhuang into a production city, and are constantly building it with unparalleled perseverance under difficult conditions. Employees of state-owned enterprises generally received year-end bonuses, thanks to their inventions, their enthusiasm for work, their mutual assistance and love... Labor heroes are highly respected by the broad masses of people.

　　The average output of woven cloth per loom in the No. 1 branch of the Flourishing Yarn Factory has increased from the July record of 39 yards (each yard being 2.7 Chinese feet) last year to 46 yards. Weaver Li Xiukai has reached a record of 53 and six-tenths yards. They not only increased the quantity of woven cloth but also improved the quality of the cloth. The percentage of broken warps per piece of cloth quickly dropped to a level below 0.05. They cherish the machines, often sacrificing rest time to clean and repair them; they save power, habitually turning off street lights on moonlit nights. Many people forget fatigue and automatically work overtime. Everyone cherishes the factory like their own home because they have become the masters of the factory.

　　The Forward Railway Factory increased the efficiency of repairing locomotives by 56 percent in the enthusiastic competition among employees. The attitude toward work has also become more serious. Everyone inspects the locomotives for problems, carefully like doctors treating patients, so that every locomotive leaving the factory can run healthily in the wilderness of North China. The employees of the Railway Bureau conducted democratic work inspections, and their enthusiasm was even higher. They cherish locomotives, cherish equipment, overcome difficulties, and accurately complete driving tasks.

　　The employees of the Electric Light Company worked tirelessly day and night to complete the repair tasks under the constant bombing and destruction by the Kuomintang, and increased power generation. Now they have repaired many transformers to expand the power supply. At the same time, they have also reduced the price of electricity. It is also planned to install electric pumps in the countryside near the city that already has electricity to develop water conservancy and increase the percentage of power generation utilization.

　　The Waterworks also inspected its work, investigated the city's water consumption, adjusted the water supply, and repaired the waterways.

　　With the efforts of the working people, Shijiazhuang is growing. The employees of Shijiazhuang are receiving extra wages and bonuses due to their own efforts. With the help of consumer cooperatives, their lives have been greatly improved. This is best illustrated by the fact that Ruihua Bank and Shijiazhuang branch of the People's Bank have successively launched in-kind savings business in units of "@" to absorb employee deposits.

　　Democratically elect employee representatives; guarantee employee benefits.

　　Preparations are underway to convene the city's first employee representative conference. All members of the trade unions in various enterprises and industries elected their trusted representatives by secret ballot. The number of representatives is allocated according to the proportion of members in each trade union. In order to guarantee the production of female member representatives and the separate discussion of women workers' issues, it is specifically stipulated that the election meeting of female member representatives must be held separately. More than 6,930 employee members in the city are enjoying an unprecedented democratic life. They can actively put forward many proposals for employee welfare - for better work, for building a new Shijiazhuang, and hand them over to their representatives to be brought to the conference for discussion.

　　The 26th anniversary of the "February 7th" strike, a glorious day for the working class. Led by old comrades who participated in the "February 7th" strike, the employees of Shijiazhuang held a torchlight parade of 5,000 people. The marching team was warmly cheered by citizens everywhere. Li Jimin, an old worker from the Railway Factory, said: "Now we can stand up and speak..." Yes, the executioners who slaughtered the people will always be crushed by the power of the people, whether it is Wu Peifu or Chiang Kai-shek... Look! Aren't the workers already free to march in their own city!

　　For the first time, employees stood up to reasonably fight against those who did not abide by the laws and decrees of the People's Government, speculated and profiteered, disrupted the market, and violated the welfare of laborers. Some ignorant bosses and owners in the First District beat and scolded apprentices, infringing upon the rights that employees should enjoy, and were immediately protested by more than 650 industry workers. On the 13th of this month, they gathered at the First Complete Elementary School to reason with the illegal actors in public. If capitalists who do not abide by the "labor-capital both benefit" policy do not wake up, they will soon be sanctioned by the broad masses of working people.

　　The working people have received factual education, further enhancing their awareness and recognizing the power of organization. Before and after the election of trade union representatives, they have asked to join the trade union one after another. Especially in the First District, after this protest against illegal bosses, more people asked to join the trade union. The number of employee members in the district quickly increased from 800 to 1,000. Xu Zhaofeng, a clerk at Yonghe Tang, said: "The fact that I was dismissed for no reason and can return to the counter is not illustrating the power of workers uniting?..."

　　Openly establish Party branches; develop the Communist Youth League.

　　Party branches have been openly established in various enterprises and departments and districts in Shijiazhuang. The working people are getting closer to the Party, and a large number of workers are flocking to join the Party. At the open branch meeting of the Telephone Bureau, four people including Bai Wengang requested to join the Party. When the citizens and masses met their leaders - the Communist Party of China - at the Party's open meeting, they continuously cheered "Long live the Communist Party" with infinite enthusiasm. At the meeting, the Party Committee called on the people to criticize Party members, help Party members progress, and called on the working people and progressive intellectuals to strive to join the Party. The citizens responded with showers of applause and cheers from time to time. The Party is more closely connected with the masses. Party members are working more actively. Many outstanding working people have already written applications to join the Party and written autobiographies, hoping to quickly become a glorious Communist Party member.

　　The New Democratic Youth League is also being established more widely in Shijiazhuang and is growing day by day. According to incomplete statistics, the number of League members in the city has increased to more than 700. The Municipal Security Brigade and the Fifth Complete Elementary School have also established League branches. In order to unify the leadership of the League, a preparatory meeting of the Municipal New Youth League Executive Committee was held on January 6th, resolving to convene a city-wide League member representative conference at the end of this month, and to study the decision of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China on establishing the New Democratic Youth League and the draft charter of the League that was promulgated, and to formulate the election law for the representative conference.

　　Women of Shijiazhuang

　　Zhou Li, the female head of the neighborhood, said: "Only the Communist Party can liberate women." Yes, the women of Shijiazhuang have widely participated in political activities and participated in the work of various departments.

　　The city-wide women's representative conference opened on the 16th of this month, with 70 representatives gathered together. They came from various departments and neighborhoods, bringing the opinions and urgent demands of women throughout the city to solve problems, and elected representatives to attend the National Women's Representative Conference. The representatives included workers, students, teachers, Hui people, and women from various neighborhoods... Most of them are activists - leaders supported by women - who have endured the cruel oppression of the old society and have been actively working since liberation. For example, Zhou Gui, a representative from the First District in the presidium of the conference, became a child bride at the age of nine, became a mother at the age of fourteen, and her husband was a railway worker who often lost his job during the enemy occupation. The family endured cold and hunger for more than 30 years. Now her husband and son are both working in the Railway Bureau, and there is no more fear of unemployment or hunger. The whole family changed into new clothes for the New Year. She said: "We couldn't have had this life without the Communist Party." So she actively serves everyone and is supported by the citizens. She was elected as the head of the neighborhood and elected as a women's representative. She said: "I will serve the masses honestly in the future. In the past, what was the role of women in anything? Now we can turn ourselves around..."

　　They are further liberated because they actively participate in labor and production. Many of the women in Shijiazhuang have been organized to work, striving to achieve equal status with men economically. A large number of female workers and family members of employees in Shijiazhuang have also been organized to produce, making military uniforms, spinning yarn, and family members of employees of the Electric Light Company going to cut magnetic iron sheets... They are actively engaged in labor in various aspects.

　　They are liberated, and the number of female students in spare-time literacy schools is increasing rapidly. Many people are urgently demanding cultural learning.

　　Celebrating victory, Spring Festival, supporting the army.

　　Shijiazhuang has spent three carnival festivals in the past two months.

　　The news of the liberation of Tianjin on January 15th brought jubilation to Shijiazhuang. Trade unions, telephone bureaus, transportation companies... Various agencies and schools were dispatched, propaganda vehicles, propaganda teams, Yangko teams, and reporting teams... merging with citizens into a torrent of carnival. Songs and cheers filled every street.

　　The news of the liberation of Beiping came. At the victory celebration meeting on the afternoon of the 1st of this month, 60,000 citizens participated. The joyful people shouted slogans to carry the revolution through to the end and sent a telegram supporting Chairman Mao's statement on the current situation.

　　In the victory carnival, the people enthusiastically launched a movement to support the army, sending more than 37,000 comfort bags and many banners, carrying the high respect of 200,000 people in Shijiazhuang to the front, exceeding the municipal party committee's call for 30,000 comfort bags by a quarter.

　　The Spring Festival is no longer just a festival for the rich. No working people are spending it in hunger and cold as before. The poor have all received Spring Festival subsidy grain issued by the government. Military families are even more cared for by the citizens and the government. They received gifts and received respect, with honorary plaques hanging at the door. The hearts of laborers are soaked in the jubilation of victory. Cadres from the Municipal Government and the Street Government went to visit military families and workers' families in groups for the New Year. They were often enthusiastically pulled by the citizens to go home for dinner. An old military family said: "You are even closer than my daughters."

　　The Yangko teams and lion dances in the streets... show the joy of the masters.

　　Municipal Affairs Snippets

　　On January 20th, a city-wide clean-up campaign was launched. After a city-wide clean-up inspection, it has attracted the attention of citizens. The Sixth District has specially established a hygiene committee, which works regularly. Citizens, various agencies, and schools have expressed their guarantees not to store filth and to keep the streets clean.

　　Epidemic prevention work was launched. Starting from the First and Fourth Districts, doctors dispatched by the Health Section of the Construction Bureau universally vaccinated citizens. 3,266 children under the age of fourteen have been vaccinated in the First District, and other neighborhoods are also being vaccinated.

　　The Municipal Hospital reduced the prices of ordinary medicines, and the emergency registration fee is only five yuan, so that ordinary citizens have equal access to medical treatment.

　　The urban supply and marketing cooperatives are developing rapidly. By the end of January, there were 18 supply and marketing cooperatives in the city, with more than 9,000 members. They can all receive grain and daily necessities at prices lower than the market price.

　　Employee spare-time literacy schools and citizen spare-time literacy schools have been established by trade unions and civil education centers respectively. Hundreds of students have the opportunity to study and improve their cultural and political level.

　　On the first day of the lunar new year, the Civil Education Center had 13,041 visitors, with women accounting for about one-fifth. In addition to providing books for citizens and cadres to borrow, it also specially prepared books for workers in various factories. The street broadcasting station set up by the center broadcasts news and some common knowledge, which is very popular among citizens.

　　On February 2nd, postal services were opened with Ping, Jin, Bao, and Zhangjiakou, and other newly recovered cities. Remittances can also be made with various places in East China. There is now a highway directly to Zhuozhou County, and passenger buses also began selling tickets on February 1st.

专栏：

　　石家庄近况
    人民解放军以伟大的胜利进军迎接了一九四九年；石家庄的人民，特别是石家庄的工人们，也以生产战线上的胜利迎接了一九四九年。
  　新的产量，新的建设，新的劳动效率。
    劳动人民把石家庄变成生产城市，更以无比的坚韧在困难的条件下不断建设它。公营企业的职工普遍获得了年终奖金，由于他们的创造发明，他们的工作热情，他们的互助友爱……劳动英雄受到广大人民崇高的敬爱。
    繁荣纱厂一分厂每车织布的平均产量已由去年七月的纪录三十九码（每码二尺七寸）升至四十六码。织工李修凯已达五十三又十分之六码的纪录。他们不但提高织布数量，同时也提高了布的质量。每匹布断径的百分数迅速降至○·○五以下的水平。他们爱护机器，常牺牲休息时间清洁修理它们；他们节省动力，月光的夜里都习惯的随手关上路灯。许多人忘记疲劳的自动加班。大家爱护工厂象自己的家，因为他们已变成工厂的主人。
    前进铁路工厂在职工热情的竞赛中把修理机车的效率提高了百分之五十六。工作的态度也更加认真。大家检查机车的毛病，细心的象医治病人的医生，使每一架出厂的机车都能健壮的奔驰在华北的原野。铁路局的职工进行了民主的工作检查，热情更高了。爱护机车，爱护器材克服困难，准确的完成行车任务。
    电灯公司在国民党不断的轰炸破坏下，职工日夜不息艰苦的完成修复任务，提高了发电量。现又修好许多变压器扩大电力的供应。还同时减低了用电的价格。更计划在市区附近，已供电的农村装设电泵，发展水利，增加发电利用量的百分率。
    自来水厂也检查了工作，调查全市用水状况，调整供水量，修复水道。
    在劳动人民的努力下，石市在生长中。石市的职工们正由于自己的努力得到超额工资与奖金，再加上消费合作社的帮助，生活已大大提高，这从瑞华银行与人民银行石市分行先后举办以“＠”为单位的实物储蓄业务吸收职工存款，可以得到最好的说明。
  　民主选举职工代表；保障职工福利。
    筹备召开全市第一届职工代表大会。各企业各行业职工会会员全体以无记名投票普选了自己所信托的代表。代表名额是按照各工会会员比例分配的。更为保证女会员代表的产生，及女工问题的单独讨论。特别规定女会员代表的选举会要单独举行。全市六千九百三十余职工会员享受着从未有过的民主生活。都能积极提出许多为职工福利——为更好的工作，为建设新石家庄的议案，交给自己的代表带到大会去讨论。
    “二七”二十六周年纪念，这工人阶级光荣的日子。石市职工在参加过“二七”罢工运动的老战友的带头下，举行了一个五千人的火炬游行。游行的大队到处受到市民热烈的欢呼。铁路工厂老工人李计敏说：“现在我们能站起来说话了……”是的，屠杀人民的郐子手总要为人民的力量压碎，无论是吴佩孚或蒋介石……看！工人们不是已经自由地在自己的城市来游行了吗！
    职工们第一次站起来同那些不遵守人民政府法令、投机取巧、扰乱市场、侵犯劳动者福利的人作合理斗争。一区一些不明大义的老板厂主打骂了学徒，侵犯职工应享的权利，立刻受到六百五十余名行业工人的抗议。他们于本月十三日集会在第一完全小学要与非法者公开说理。凡不遵守“劳资两利”政策的资本家如不觉悟的话，他们将会迅速受到广大劳动人民的制裁。
    劳动人民得到事实的教育，更提高了觉悟，认识到组织起来的力量。在选举职工会代表前后，纷纷要求加入职工会。尤其是一区经过这次抗议非法老板的集会后，要求加入职工会的更多了。该区职工会员由八百人迅速增至千人。永和堂店员许兆峰说：“我这次被无故开除又能回柜，还不是说明工人团结起来的力量吗？……”
  　公开党的支部；发展青年团。
    石市各企业部门及各区分别公开了党支部，劳动人民更加靠近了党，大批工人涌入党的队伍。电话局在公开支部大会上即有白文刚等四人要求入党。当市民群众在党的公开大会上与自己的领导者——中国共产党见面时都以无限热情不断欢呼共产党万岁。会上，党委号召人民给党员批评，帮助党员进步，号召劳动人民及进步知识分子争取入党。市民不时报以骤雨似的掌声与欢呼。党与群众更密切的联系起来了。党员更加积极工作了。许多优秀的劳动人民已在写入党申请书，写自传。希望快快成为一个光荣的共产党员。
    新民主主义青年团也在石市更广泛的建立起来并日益壮大着，据不完全统计全市团员已增至七百余人，市保安大队与第五完全小学也建立了团支部，更为统一团的领导，在一月六日召开了市新青团执行委员会筹备会，决议在本月底召开全市团员代表大会，并通过学习中共中央关于建立新民主主义青年团的决议及所公布的团章草案。制定代表大会的选举法。
  　石市的妇女
    女闾长周李氏说：“只有共产党才能解放妇女。”是的，石市的妇女们已广泛的参加了政治活动，参加了各种部门的工作。
    本月十六日全市妇女代表大会开幕，七十位代表齐聚一堂。她们来自各个不同的部门街区，带来了全市妇女的意见与迫切要求解决的问题。并选举了出席全国妇女代表大会的代表。代表们包括了工人、学生、教职员、回民及各街区妇女……她们大多数是经受过旧社会惨酷的压迫，得到解放后的积极工作者——妇女们拥护的领袖。象大会主席团中一区代表周桂，九岁当了童养媳，十四岁做母亲，丈夫是铁路工人，在敌占时常常失业。一家人忍冻受饿捱过卅多年。现在丈夫、儿子都在铁路局服务，再没有失业再没有饥饿的恐惧，一家大小换上新衣过年，她说：“这日子不是共产党来那能得到。”所以她积极为大家办事，得到市民拥护。被选为闾长，被选为妇女代表。她说：“我今后更要为群众老老实实办事。过去什么事那儿有妇女的份？现在可翻身了……”
    她们得到解放更由于她们积极参加劳动生产，石市的妇女许多已组织起来工作。从经济方面努力来求得与男子平等的地位。石市有大批女工、职工家属们也组织起来生产。做军衣、纺纱，电灯公司职工家属去剪磁铁片……她们在各方面积极从事劳动。
    她们解放了，业余补习学校妇女学生的名额正迅速的增加着。很多人已迫切的要求文化学习。
  　祝捷，春节，劳军。
    石市两月来度过三个狂欢的节日。
    一月十五号天津解放的消息给石市带来了欢腾。职工会、电话局、交通运输公司……各机关、各学校出动了，宣传车、宣传队、秧歌队、报喜队……与市民汇合成狂欢的洪流。歌声、欢呼声充溢在每个街头。
    北平解放的消息传来。本月一日下午的祝捷大会，参加了六万市民，狂欢的人民高呼着将革命进行到底的口号，通电拥护毛主席对目前时局的声明。
    人民在胜利的狂欢中热烈的展开劳军运动，三万七千多慰劳袋和许多锦旗，带着石市二十万人民崇高的敬意送到前方。超过了市委号召三万慰劳袋的四分之一。
    春节，已不单是有钱人的节日了，劳动人民已没有一个象从前一样的在饥寒中度过，贫民都得到政府发放的春节补助粮。军属，更受到市民与政府的照顾。他们得到了礼物得到了尊敬，门口悬着光荣匾。劳动者的心浸润在胜利的欢腾中。市政府街政府的干部们分组到军属、工人家拜年。他们常常被市民热情的拉着要到家去吃饭，一个军属老大娘说：“你们真比俺的闺女还亲。”
    街上的秧歌队、狮子舞……说明了主人的欢欣。
  　市政点滴
    一月二十日布置全市清洁卫生运动，经过全市清洁大检查后，已引起市民注意，六区特别成立卫生委员会，经常工作。市民，各机关，各学校，均纷纷表示保证不存污秽，保持街道清洁。
    展开防疫工作，从一、四区开始由建设局卫生科派医生普遍给市民种痘。一区十四岁以下儿童已种三千二百六十六名，其他各街区也正在施种中。
    市立医院减低普通药价，急诊挂号费仅收五元，使一般市民皆有同等医疗机会。
    市区供销合作社在飞速发展，至一月底全市已有十八个供销社，社员九千余人，他们都能得到低于市价的粮食及日用品的供给。
    职工业余补习学校及市民业余补习学校，已分由职工会、民教馆设立。数百学员都得到学习机会，提高文化及政治水平。
    民教馆旧历元旦，参观者有一万三千零四十一人，妇女约占五分之一，图书除供市民干部借阅外，又特别预备供给各工厂工人图书。该馆设立的街头广播台除广播新闻外，还广播一些普通常识，很受市民欢迎。
    二月二日已与平、津、保、张垣，各新收复城市通邮。且可与华东各地通汇。现已有公路直通涿县，客车也于二月一日开始售票。
