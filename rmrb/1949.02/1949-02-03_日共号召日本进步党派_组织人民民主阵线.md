　　Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 1st—Tokyo News: The Japanese Communist Party, which achieved an important victory in this election, is leading the organization of the Japanese People's Democratic Front to oppose American imperialism and the reactionary forces in power in Japan. The Central Political Bureau of the Japanese Communist Party recently called on advanced members of the Japanese Labor-Farmer Party and the Socialist Party to join forces with the Japanese Communist Party to strive for the liberation of the Japanese people and national independence. Shortly after this call was issued, Japanese Communist Party representatives Ritsu Ito, Katsumi Kikitake, and Ichikichi Tsuchibashi formally visited Inejiro Asanuma, Secretary-General of the Socialist Party, on January 28th, proposing a thirteen-point joint action plan, strongly urging the Socialist Party to fight against the reactionary Yoshida government together. Prior to this, Tokuda Kyuichi, Secretary-General of the Japanese Communist Party, had called on the Labor-Farmer Party, the Socialist Party, and the Communist Party to jointly organize a People's Democratic Front to oppose the reactionary Yoshida government. Nozaka Sanzo, another prominent leader of the Japanese Communist Party, also urged the Socialist Party and the Japanese Communist Party to jointly work towards a plan to achieve complete independence for Japan and stabilize the lives of the Japanese people at a symposium held on January 26th. Nozaka emphasized that the Socialist Party's failure in the general election was due to its alliance with reactionary parties. Although this proposal of the Japanese Communist Party will, as in the past, win the approval of Socialist Party members and local branches, certain upper-level figures of the Socialist Party, such as the Socialist Party Chairman Tetsu Katayama, who was abandoned by the Japanese people in this election, once again exposed his face as a running dog of American and Japanese reactionaries, declaring that "under no circumstances will he cooperate with the Communist Party."

　　日共号召日本进步党派
  　组织人民民主阵线
    【新华社陕北一日电】东京消息：在这次选举中得到重要胜利的日本共产党，正在领导组织日本人民民主阵线，以反对美国帝国主义和日本当权的反动派。日本共产党中央政治局日前曾号召日本工农党与社会党的先进党员与日共联合努力，以争取日本人民解放与民族独立。这一号召发出以后不久，日共代表伊滕律、听涛克已与土桥一吉于一月二十八日正式访问社会党书记长浅沼稻次郎，提出十三点联合行动的建议，力促社会党为共同反对反动的吉田政府而斗争。在此以前，日共总书记德田球一曾号召工农党与社会党和共产党共同组织人民民主阵线，以反对吉田反动政府。日共另一著名领袖野坂参三在一月二十六日举行的一个座谈会上，亦敦促社会党与日共共同致力于争取日本完全独立和稳定日本人民生活的计划。野坂强调指出：社会党在大选中的失败，系由于它和反动政党联合所致。日本共产党这一建议，虽然将如过去一样，赢得社会党党员与地方支部的赞同，但社会党的某些上层分子，例如在这次选举中为日本人民所抛弃的社会党主席片山哲，又一次暴露了甘充美、日反动派走卒的面目，他声明“在任何情况下，均将不与共产党合作。”
