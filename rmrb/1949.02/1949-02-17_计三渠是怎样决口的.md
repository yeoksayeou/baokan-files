To the Editor:
　　In the "Criticism and Suggestions" column on page two of your newspaper on January 13th, comrades Yang Jinhe and Fan Ke功, the director of the Wasteland in Dongye Village, Yiqu District, Pingshan, raised the issue that "the Ji San Canal breached this year because the gate was not opened? A breach occurred in the canal, and a flood inundated more than 70 mu of green crops, which has not yet been resolved." This issue did occur during my tenure (I was transferred to Ji San Canal as director in early June last year, and after Ji San Canal was transferred to private operation in winter, I left in early December), but it does not fully align with the facts, and I need to explain it:
　　According to the situation, the Ji San Canal intake (with a gate) extends from the Qin Kou bridge to the west against the Ye River and is adjacent to Dongye to the east. Downstream from the beach (on the bank) there is a spillway (the gate is west of the T-shaped bank), and further downstream is Mengbao Beach, which is the bifurcation of the Ji San Canal. The "breach" occurred on the western bank between the Qin Kou bridge and the spillway.
　　The main reason for the breach was that the river water rose too high. After four days of heavy rain on the 13th, 14th, 15th, and 16th days of the sixth lunar month last year, the river water rose eight or nine feet, washing away a large section of the western embankment (levee) of the Ji San Canal, about 150 zhang from the intake to the Qin Kou bridge, and about 20 zhang below the Qin Kou bridge. River water poured into the Ji San Canal, and at the same time, the Dongye Beach main canal (slightly downstream from the Qin Kou bridge) on the east bank also broke open, and the canal water also poured into the Ji San Canal, causing the Ji San Canal to breach and inundate the Dongye Beach land. These traces can still be seen now. One point needs to be clarified: the water intake gate of the Ji San Canal was closed by the gatekeeper when the flood first occurred. Another reason, which seems not to be the main one, is the opening and closing of the spillway below (which may be what the Dongye comrades referred to as "not opening the gate"). It is said that when the river water rose sharply, the gatekeeper opened the gate panel (old-style gate). Later, the masses of Mengbao Beach, seeing that the river water contained mud, closed several panels again to silt up the land (but not enough). I think that closing the panels is certainly not as smooth as not closing them, and in theory, it seems to raise the water level, which may have contributed to the breach. But in reality, it seems that even without closing the panels, the breach would have been unavoidable, because the distance was far and too much water entered.
　　Regarding the aftermath of the incident, I only know about two occasions. Initially, after the flood (I don't remember the exact time), comrades from Dongye Beach sent a letter requesting a survey of the inundated land and resolution of the compensation issue (we already knew about the breach). Then, Engineering Section Chief Li Chuhe, General Affairs Section Chief Hou Rongxiang, Xin'an Branch (Ji San Canal Branch)负责人 Fu Fenglin and I went to see it again. At that time, because the riverine flood disaster was too severe, I had a separate concern—the canal's finances were in trouble, and many cadres' morale was low. How could such a large project be repaired? The main issue was whether the Ji San Canal should compensate for the inundation of Dongye Beach land caused by the breach. We all agreed that the water that flooded Dongye Beach came from the breach of the Ji San Canal, and the source of the water was the water from the main river and the Dongye main canal, not the water that entered from the Ji San Canal intake. Therefore, we could not acknowledge the compensation. Also, because it was late, I did not meet with the people from Dongye Beach. I just entrusted Comrade Fenglin (who lives in the Xin'an Branch, which is very close to Dongye) to contact Dongye Beach in his spare time to see how to resolve it (they talked, but the problem was not solved). Later, we received a letter from the Pingshan Yiqu District Office, roughly saying: According to a report from Dongye Beach, "Dongye Beach was flooded due to the breach, and the Ji San Canal should be responsible for compensation." We immediately replied with the above-mentioned facts of the breach, explaining that it would be difficult for the Ji San Canal to be fully responsible, and requested the District Office to provide more explanations to the Dongye Beach masses. After that, there was no news about this issue, and I thought it was resolved. I continued to think this way until I left Ji San.
　　Now that Director Yang and Fan and other comrades from Dongye Beach have raised the issue in the newspaper, it shows that the masses have not thoroughly understood this issue and are still not satisfied. Regarding our work, we should review: Although we replied to the District Office letter and entrusted them to provide explanations, I indeed did not personally go to Dongye Village to conduct in-depth explanations and mobilizations with the cadres and the masses to thoroughly resolve the problem. Today, upon review, this is a concrete manifestation of a bureaucratic work style that does not care about the suffering of the masses. Therefore, I fully accept comrades Yang and Fan's criticism of me: "He only sits in the room writing letters to the county and district and does not reply to us, nor can he solve the problems of the masses." This is very beneficial for me to recall and review my work, the impact on the masses, and improve my work style. It is worth vigilance and attention in the future.
　　Regarding how to solve the problem in the future, I have already left the Ji San Canal and can only provide a few suggestions for reference:
　　1. The breach of the Ji San Canal should be viewed from two aspects: On the one hand, the river water rose too high, and we encountered an irresistible major flood disaster. This flood not only harmed Dongye Beach, but also greatly harmed the Ji San Canal. Dongye Beach should look at it from this aspect. Therefore, it should automatically explain to the masses and not demand full compensation. If the masses have difficulties in life due to the flood, it is possible to request the government or other parties to provide care or relief. On the other hand, the project was not consolidated. The original western bank (near the river) of the Ji San Canal, according to the old-style project, was considered not small, but after all, it was built with sand and stones without adding materials (lime or cement) to make it strong. It is impossible to resist the flood of the Ye River. The Ji San Canal should look at it from this aspect. Therefore, it should proactively contact Dongye to express condolences to the affected households and provide necessary care or compensation to strengthen the unity between the two sides. At the same time, when repairing the project this spring, we should implement the idea of ​​long-term construction and that people will conquer nature to make it strong and consolidated to prevent future troubles.
　　2. I believe that the comrades of Dongye Beach and the newly elected standing committee comrades of Ji San Canal should actively contact each other again about this matter (whoever finds whom first is best). Under the principles of mutual concession and mutual understanding, without going to extremes and without causing prejudice, the problem can still be solved. This is my reply.

### 计三渠是怎样决口的

第2版()
专栏：检讨与答复

　　计三渠是怎样决口的编辑同志：
    贵报一月十三日第二版批评与建议栏内，有平山一区东冶村荒滩主任杨金和、范克功等同志提出“计三渠今年因为没有开闸？把渠里蹩了一个决口，大水冲淹了七十来亩青苗迄未解决”一事，这问题确是在我任期内（我于去年六月初调到计三渠当主任，到冬天计三渠转移民办后，十二月初我就离开了）所发生的，但与事实不完全相符合，我有说明的必要：
    按情形说计三渠取水口（有闸）至擒口桥以下是西靠冶河、东邻东冶，滩干（在岸上）往下有一泄水口（闸在丁字岸西）再往下就是孟堡滩，在计三渠的分水口了，而“决口”正是在擒口桥与泄水口之间的西埂上。
    决口的原因主要是河水涨得过大，去年阴历六月十三、四、五、六四天大雨之后，河水涨了八九尺，把计三渠很大的西堤（埂）取水口以下至擒口桥一百五十来丈和擒口桥以下廿来丈都冲毁了。河水涌进计三渠来，同时东岸上东冶滩干渠（在擒口桥略靠下处）也打了豁，渠水也冲进计三渠来，这样才把计三渠崩了决口，淹了东冶滩地。这种痕迹现在还可能看得出来。有一点需说明计三渠的取水闸在刚发水时司闸员已给闭住了。另外还有一个原因好象不是主要的，就是下边那一泄水闸的开闭问题（也许就是东冶同志所指的“没开闸”之处），据说当河水暴涨时，司闸员把闸板拉开了（旧式闸），后来孟堡滩群众见河水有泥土，为淤地又闸起几块板（也没闸够数），我认为这一闸板当然不如不闸流泄更加畅通，在论理上好象与决口有提高水位之嫌，而实际看来就是不闸板也难免决口的，崩开是因为距离较远而进水太多了。
    问题发生后的经过，我知道的只有两次。开始在大水发过之后（记不清时间），东冶滩同志来过一信，要求勘验淹地情形，解决赔偿问题（决口问题我们先已知道），接着我和我们工程股长李初和、总务股长侯荣祥、辛安分会（计三渠分会）负责人付风林同志又去看了一次，当时因为沿河水灾过重，那时我的思想上有一种另外负担——渠上经济正在困难，不少干部情绪低落，若大工程怎么整修——而主要问题还是计三渠决口淹了冶滩地，是否应该赔偿的问题，一致认为淹东冶滩的水是从计三渠决口出来的，而水的来源则是大河之水与东冶干渠之水，并不是从计三渠取水口进来的水，这是没法来承认赔偿的。同时因天晚了我也没有和东冶滩的人见面，只是托风林同志（住辛安分会距东冶很近）抽空与东冶滩联系一下，看如何解决好（他们谈过，但没有解决了问题）。后来又接平山一区区公所来信大意说：据东冶滩报告“东冶滩因决口被淹，计三渠应负赔偿之责”，我们即以上述决口事实回复，说明计三渠很难完全负责，并请区公所多给东冶滩群众解释为盼。此后这一问题就没音信了，我以为是解决了，一直到我离开计三时还是这样想法。
    现在既经东冶滩主任杨、范等同志在报上提出，正说明群众对这一问题没有彻底弄清，还不满意。在我们工作方面检讨：虽然我们答复了区公所信，转托代为解释，但我确实没有亲自到东冶村向干部与群众作深入的解释动员，把问题彻底解决，今天检查，实在是不关心群众痛苦的官僚主义作风的具体表现。因此杨、范等同志对我的批评“他只坐在屋里给县、区写信，并不答复我们，也解决不了群众的问题”我完全接受，这对我回忆、检讨工作，对群众的影响与改进工作作风方面都有很大好处，值得今后警惕与注意。
    今后如何解决的问题，我已离开计三渠了，只能提供几点意见，供参考：
    一、计三渠的决口应从两方面着眼：一方面是河水涨得过大，我们遇到了不可抗拒的大水灾，这个水灾不仅东冶滩受害，而计三渠的受害也很大。东冶滩应向这方面看。因此应自动向群众解释，不作全部赔赏的要求，如果群众有因水灾而致生活困难时，请求政府或其他方面设法照顾或救济都是可以的。另一方面是工程不巩固。计三渠原来的西埂（靠河处），按旧式工程说也算不小，但毕竟还是沙子乱石筑成，没有加料（石灰或洋灰）细作是不巩固的，不可能抗拒冶河大水，计三渠应向这方面看，因此应主动与东冶联系慰问受灾户，作必要的照顾或补赔，以加强双方团结。同时在今春修复工程时，应贯彻为常年建设、人定胜天的思想做到坚强巩固以防后患。
    二、我认为东冶滩同志与计三渠新选的常委同志们，均应主动的为此事再联系一下（谁先找谁最好），在相互让步、相互谅解的原则下，不走极端，不闹成见，问题还是可以解决的。此复
