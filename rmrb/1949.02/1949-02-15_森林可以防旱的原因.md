To the Editor:

According to newspaper reports, forests and small woodlands can prevent drought and regulate rainfall. After reading this, I have been researching for a long time why forests and woodlands can prevent drought and regulate rainfall, but I can't find a reason. I have asked many people and have not received a satisfactory answer. Please explain.

Comrade Yang Quan:

The reasons why forests and small woodlands can prevent drought and regulate rainfall are answered below:

   I. Forests can increase air humidity - After rain falls on forest land, the evaporative power is reduced due to the shading of the tree canopy. The amount of water evaporation in the forest is about half less than that outside the forest. For example, after rain, the ground outside the forest dries before the ground inside the forest. The temperature inside the forest is lower than the temperature outside the forest in summer, which is due to the low evaporation. This reduction in evaporation and the lower temperature in the forest make the humidity in the forest higher than outside the forest. In addition, tree roots absorb water from the ground, and in addition to using some of it themselves, the rest is transpired into the air by the leaves, which also increases air humidity. Therefore, the air above forests or near forests is often humid.

   II. Forests can retain rainwater - In places with forests, after rain, the rainwater does not completely flow away. Some of it seeps into the soil, and some is absorbed by the tree roots, and then dispersed into the air by the leaves. Therefore, the humidity above the forest is high and easily saturated, and the number of rainy days is more than in treeless areas. The ground can retain a large amount of water, which slowly flows out and can irrigate farmland when it does not rain.

   III. Forests can increase rainfall - The moisture flowing from the ocean is blocked by the forest. At the same time, the humidity above the forest is very high. Adding the moisture flowing in, it is easy to reach the saturation point (100 degrees humidity), and encountering the low-temperature cool air above the forest, it condenses into rain.

The above three points, such as the tens of thousands of acres of natural large forests in the Wutai and Fanrong areas, naturally have this effect. If there are more small woodlands in various places, they will also have a great effect.

   IV. Forests can harmonize dry air - If the wind blocked by the forest is a dry wind, then this dry influence will be harmonized by the moisture of the forest and will not spread to other places.

   V. Forests can prevent flying sand - In places with sand, blown by the wind, it either flies in the air or covers good farmland, which can cause a great drying effect. Creating forests can prevent sand, which is also a kind of drought prevention. For these reasons, it is said that forests have the effect of preventing drought and regulating rainfall.

### 森林可以防旱的原因

专栏：询问与答复

　　森林可以防旱的原因编辑同志：
    据报纸刊登森林及小树林可以防旱，调剂雨量，看后经过很久研究，为什么森林树林可以防旱调剂雨量，总是找不出理由，曾询问许多人也未得到圆满的答复，请解答一下。
              　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　杨泉杨泉同志：
    森林及小树林可以防旱调剂雨量的原因，我们答复如下：
    一、森林能增加空中湿度——雨落下林地后，因树冠之遮被，蒸发力为之减小，林中水分之蒸发量比林外约小一半，如下雨以后，林外地面比林内地面先干，夏天林内的温度比林外温度低，就是由于蒸发量低的原故。这种蒸发量的低减与林中较低温度，就使得林中的湿度比林外为高。此外树根由地中吸取水分，除本身应用一部分外，其余均由树叶蒸散到空中，也增加空中湿度，因此森林或近林处的上空，空气常常是湿润的。
    二、森林能保持雨水——有森林的地方，下雨之后，雨水不致完全流去，一部分渗入土中，一部分被树根吸收，再由树叶散入空中，所以森林上空的湿度大，容易饱和，下雨的次数比无林地多。地中可以保持大量水分，慢慢流出，在不下雨的时候，可以灌溉农田。
    三、森林能增加雨量——由海洋上流过来的湿气，过森林则为所阻，同时森林上面湿度很大，加上流过来的湿气，容易达到饱和点（湿度一百度），又遇森林上面低温凉气，遂凝结而为雨。
    以上所说三点如五台、繁荣一带都是几万亩的天然大森林，自然具有这种作用，若各地小树林多了，也有很大的作用。
    四、森林能调和干燥空气——森林所阻的风如为干风，则此种干燥影响将受森林之湿气而调和，不致再波及于他处。
    五、森林能防飞砂——有砂的地方，经风吹播，或飞扬空中或遮被良田，会发生很大的干燥影响。造成树林，可以防砂，也是防旱的一种。由于这些原因，所以说森林有防旱调剂雨量的作用。
