　　Turned-Over Peasant Shi Shuhui
  　This Year's Production Plan
    [Jinan News] "Now that we've overthrown feudalism and turned ourselves over, we must work hard to produce well." With this belief, Shi Shuhui, a turned-over peasant from Xuguzhai, plans to plow deeply, cultivate meticulously, and apply more fertilizer to strive for increased harvests this year. His family was originally poor peasants. During the famine of 1932, they sold their house, land, and belongings. Later, through land redemption, capital increases, and several land reform movements, his family, including one younger brother, totaled two people. They now have enough land, more than sixteen mu, a three-room house, and half an ox. Last year, they also built a north-facing room and purchased nearly twenty kinds of furniture, including hoes, sickles, three-pronged rakes, drills, and wooden shovels. Last year, after paying 446 jin of public grain and providing for their own food and clothing, they still had surplus grain and cotton, so he always wears a smile. As soon as the Lunar New Year passed, he made a spring plowing and full-year production plan: First, what to plant: Last year, he planted seven mu of wheat. To pay public grain and feed the ox, he will plant three mu of millet for his own consumption and to harvest some sorghum to thatch the west-facing room. Because planting cotton is very profitable, he plans to plant one more mu than last year, planting enough to reach three mu. He will also plant half a mu of peanuts, which are also very profitable and can provide grass to feed the ox. After the wheat harvest, five mu will be left to grow wheat (i.e., kept for planting wheat), one mu will be planted with soybeans, and one mu will be planted with turnips, vegetables, etc. Second, apply more fertilizer: Last spring, he applied three cartloads of ash fertilizer and six or seven dou of manure to one mu of land, and later bought fifty jin of powdered residue to spread on the millet field. After the wheat harvest, he and his brother swept a lot of soil with wheat chaff and broken firewood from the edge of the field, sprinkled it with water used to boil wheat chaff to ferment it, and often collected manure, accumulating a lot of fertilizer. During the autumn plowing, he applied five bags of manure and sixteen or seventeen cartloads of ash fertilizer to the three mu of land he prepared to plant cotton this year and plowed it well. Now he still has ten cartloads of ash fertilizer and twelve bags of manure, ready to apply to the land, and will continue to make more fertilizer and collect manure, and when the crops grow up, he will sprinkle it on the land, guaranteeing even more than last year. Third, deep plowing and meticulous cultivation: Last autumn, he plowed all the land. Now he plans to harrow it all once, and in a few days, he will pull ash fertilizer to the land, then spread manure, and after the rain, pull it to the land again, then plow and sow again. For the three mu of land prepared to plant cotton, he spread fertilizer and plowed it last autumn, and after the rain, he will use a triangular harrow to go over it once, pick out the clods, crush them, and then plant. He proposed: In order to reduce the need to pull up idle seedlings, we must hoe early, guaranteeing no weeds in the millet and sorghum fields, hoeing at least four times, and hoeing cotton seven or eight times. If the rain is frequent and the grass grows quickly, hoe even more. Before plowing the land, during this free time, he plans to haul soil and make adobe bricks to prepare to build a south-facing shed. On the fifth of this month, he discovered grass in the two mu of wheat field west of his house, and plans to hoe it once when the wheat turns green. He often says to others: Besides paying public grain and providing for our own food and clothing, I also plan to have some savings this year and buy a large cart, plow, harrow, sower, and harness with others, and also plan to buy a ridgepole, five purlins, and a thousand bricks to build two west-facing rooms. We must work diligently so that the land yields more!

　　翻身农民石书会
  　今年生产计划
    【冀南讯】“打倒封建翻了身，过好还得勤生产”，在这种信念下，徐固寨翻身农民石书会，计划深耕细作多上粪，争取今年增加收成。他家原是贫苦农民，三十二年灾荒时，曾把房子卖了、地卖了、东西卖了。后来经过赎地、增资及数次土地改革运动，他家有一个弟弟，共二口人，地已够十六亩多，房有三间，还有半个牛。去年又盖了一间北屋，置买了锄、镰、三齿、钻头、木锨等家具近二十种。去年除缴四百四十六斤公粮和自己吃穿，还有余粮余棉花，所以他终日带着笑脸。阴历年刚过，他便作了春耕和全年生产计划：一、种什么：去年已种了七亩麦子，为缴公粮和牛吃草，种三亩谷子，为了自己吃和收些秫＠盖西屋用，种三亩高粱。因种棉花利大，打算比去年多种一亩，种够三亩；再种半亩花生，利又大，又能收草喂牛。过麦后，五亩晒留麦（即留着种麦子），一亩种黄豆，一亩种萝＠菜蔬等。二、多上粪：去年春天，一亩地上三车灰土粪、六七斗大粪，以后又买了五十斤粉渣撒在谷地里。过麦后，他弟兄二人在场边扫了很多有麦糠碎柴的土，泼上捞麦糠水沤，又经常拾粪，积了很多肥。秋耕时，他把五口袋大粪、十六七车灰土粪，上到准备今年种棉花的三亩地里，犁好了。现在他还有十车灰土粪、十二口袋大粪，准备往地里上，以后再多多造肥拾粪，等庄稼长起来时，再往地里撒，保证比去年还要多上。三、深耕细作：去年秋后全把地犁了。现正打算通通耙一遍，过几天就往地里拉灰土粪，然后再晒大粪，等下雨后再往地里拉，再犁再耩。准备种棉花的那三亩地，去年秋后撒了粪犁好了，等下雨后，用三角耧挑一遍，把坷垃挑出耙碎再种。他提出：为了使闲苗少拔劲，一定早锄，谷子高粱地里保证没有草，至少锄四遍，棉花锄七八遍，如果雨勤草长的快，就再多锄。犁地以前这个空闲，他计划拉土脱坯，准备盖个南厂棚。本月五号，他发现家西二亩麦子地里有了草，打算麦子发青时锄一遍。他常常对别人说：除了缴公粮和自己吃穿，我还盘算在今年有些积余，和别人伙买大车、犁、耙、耧、套，还盘算着买一架椋、五根檩条、一千砖，盖两间西屋，可得勤务作，叫地里多收！
