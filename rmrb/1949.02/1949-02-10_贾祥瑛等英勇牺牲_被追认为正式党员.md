　　Jia Xiangying and Others Heroically Sacrificed
  　Posthumously Recognized as Formal Party Members
    [Report from this newspaper] Comrades Jia Xiangying, Wu Shu, and Liu Qiyu of the Yuci Independent Regiment in Jinzhong heroically sacrificed themselves in battles against the enemy. With the approval of the regimental committee, they were posthumously recognized as formal members of the Chinese Communist Party. Comrade Jia Xiangying was from Xiama Juntou Village, Erqu District, Pinging, Shanxi Province. He was twenty-seven years old this year and was originally an ironworker. He joined our army in 1947 and served as deputy captain of the training team and platoon leader of the machine gun squad. He was always active in his work, set an example in enduring hardships during marches, and often helped comrades carry their guns. After being admitted to the Party as a probationary member in August 1948, he became even more active and brave. He never compromised when accepting tasks and had many heroic and exemplary deeds in combat. Unfortunately, he gloriously sacrificed himself in the battle to capture Xutan Village in Taiyuan County on October 17th of last year. Comrade Wu Shu was from Haocun Village, Qiqu District, Yuci. He was only seventeen years old when he sacrificed himself, serving as a squad leader and coming from a poor peasant background. He joined the army in September 1946, was brave and decisive, and once destroyed an enemy armored vehicle. He gloriously sacrificed himself while attacking Xishan in Taiyuan on December 5th of last year. He was admitted as a probationary member on October 16, 1948. Comrade Liu Qiyu was from Zhongzhuang Village, Yiqu District, Qixian County, and came from a peasant background. He joined our army in November 1947, served as a squad leader, was enthusiastic and responsible in his work, and had a great spirit of class friendship. He was patient in helping comrades learn and was resourceful and tenacious in combat. He was admitted to the Party in July 1948 as a probationary member. He gloriously sacrificed himself in the battle of Xutan on December 10th of the same year. The Yuchi Regimental Party Committee believes that these three comrades played an exemplary leading role in their work and combat during their probationary period, and has specially approved the posthumous recognition of the three comrades as formal members of the Chinese Communist Party.
