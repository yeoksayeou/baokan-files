Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 28th—The Kuomintang Democratic Promotion Association issued its opinion on the current situation on the 24th. The full text is as follows:

　　Since this association responded to the CCP Central Committee's "May 1st" call last year, responsible representatives have successively entered the liberated areas, hoping to work together with people from various democratic parties to complete the democratic revolution and build a new China. In the past few months, we have seen the rapid progress in the liberated areas under the leadership of the CCP in politics, economy, and military affairs. In particular, the stability of local order, the prosperity of industry and commerce, and the amazing achievements in land reform and production construction have allowed the people to enjoy a truly democratic and free life. What makes us even more excited is that the People's Liberation Army has gained the support of the broad masses of the people, liberated Northeast and North China in just a few months, and recently liberated many important cities in Central China, annihilating the main force of Chiang Kai-shek's reactionary army. Soon, they will directly attack Nanjing and Shanghai, destroy the counter-revolutionary rule of Nanjing, and achieve the great cause of liberating all of China.

　　Just as the Liberation War is progressing rapidly and the counter-revolutionary rule of Nanjing is about to collapse, under the instigation of American imperialism, Chiang Kai-shek, Li Zongren, Sun Ke, etc., have successively issued announcements in a planned manner, creating a smoke screen of wailing for peace. At the same time, they instructed their loyal public opinion organs, which have always advocated "suppressing the rebellion," to respond in a subservient manner, hoping to confuse the people's eyes with this smoke screen, delay the large-scale offensive of the People's Liberation Army, and allow the reactionary regime to gain a respite. We recall that after the victory of the Anti-Japanese War, the will of the people throughout the country was to pray for peace, but Chiang Kai-shek and the Nanjing reactionary regime, with the support of American imperialism, launched a large-scale reactionary war, exchanging a large amount of national sovereignty for American arms, and using American planes, warships, and transport reactionary troops to slaughter the people. They would not stop until the entire nation was placed under the enslavement of American imperialism and the four major families, never to rise again. Where was there any sincerity for peace and for the people? Now that they have suffered a disastrous military defeat and are unable to struggle, they have changed to a set of political conspiracies, releasing a smoke screen of peace, wanting to shirk their responsibility for launching the war on the one hand, and allow the reactionary regime to survive on the other. Don't we see the true face of fake peace in the conditions mentioned in Chiang Kai-shek's statement to maintain the pseudo-constitution and pseudo-legal system, and to ensure the army? As for the pseudo-executive院's resolution to "cease fire first" and then talk about peace, isn't it fully revealing the true face of fake peace? As for Chiang Kai-shek's so-called retirement, he actually wants to imitate the old tricks of stepping down from power as he plotted during the 16th and 20th years of the Republic of China, retreating from the front to the backstage to direct secretly. The form and content of the reactionary rule have not changed in the slightest. It is just a deceptive trick of their political conspiracy.

　　This association has always believed that the task of the Chinese people's revolution is to expel American imperialism, eradicate feudal remnants, confiscate bureaucratic capital, and build a truly independent, free, and democratic new China. Only by completing this task can we achieve true and lasting peace. Being content with temporary ease and compromising and reconciling will result in a great failure of the revolution. The past failures of the revolution have taught us too painful lessons, and we cannot repeat the same mistakes. What we need is true and lasting peace, not temporary and false peace. We have read the eight peace conditions in Chairman Mao Zedong's statement on the current situation and believe that they are the basic conditions for achieving true, lasting, democratic peace. This association is willing to wholeheartedly support it and strive together to achieve its full realization.

### 国民党民主促进会声明　毛主席的八项条件是真正和平的基础

　　国民党民主促进会声明
  　毛主席的八项条件是真正和平的基础
    【新华社陕北二十八日电】中国国民党民主促进会于二十四日发表对时局的意见，全文如下：
    本会于去年响应中共中央的“五一”号召以后，负责代表即先后进入解放区，期与各民主党派人士，共同为完成民主革命、建设新中国而努力。数月以来，我们看到了解放区在中共领导之下，政治、经济、军事各方面的突飞猛进，尤其地方秩序之安定、工商业之欣欣向荣，土地改革和生产建设的惊人成就，人民的确享受到了民主自由的幸福生活。更使我们兴奋的是：解放军获得广大人民的支持，在短短的几个月中，解放了东北、华北，最近在华中又解放了许多重要名城，歼灭了蒋介石反动军队的主力，很快的便会直捣京沪，摧毁反革命的南京统治，而达成解放全中国的大业。
    正当解放战争迅速进展，反革命的南京统治快要崩溃的时候，在美帝国主义策动之下，蒋介石、李宗仁、孙科等，一面有计划的先后发表文告，造出哀鸣求和的烟幕；一面指使其一贯主张“戡乱”的御用民意机关，作吠影吠形的响应，希图以这种烟幕，迷糊人民的眼睛，延缓解放军的大举进攻，而使反动政权获得喘息的机会。我们回想抗战胜利之后，全国人民的意志，都祈求和平，但是蒋介石及南京反动政权，却在美帝国主义支持之下，发动大规模的反动战争，以大批国家主权，换取美帝的军火，以美帝的飞机、兵舰、运输反动军队，来屠杀人民，非把整个民族置于美帝、及四大家族的奴役之下，永远不得翻身不止，哪有丝毫为和平、为人民的诚意？此际到了军事惨败，无力挣扎，于是另换一套政治阴谋，放出和平烟幕，想一面推卸其发动战争的责任，一面使反动政权得以苟延残喘。我们看蒋介石文告所说要维持伪宪法、伪法统，要军队有确实保障等等条件，和伪行政院的“先停战”再谈和的决议，不是充分显露出假和平的真面目了么？至于蒋介石之所谓引退，实想师法民十六、民二十两次所谋下野的故智，由前台退到后台去暗中指挥，反动统治的形式与内容没有丝毫改变，只是他们政治阴谋的一个欺骗花样而己。
    本会一向认为中国人民革命的任务是驱逐美帝国主义、铲除封建残余、没收官僚资本，建设真正独立自由民主的新中国。只有完成这个任务，才能得到真正的、永久的和平。苟且偷安、妥协调和，结果会使革命遭到莫大的失败的。过去革命失败，给我们的教训太惨痛了，我们不能再蹈覆辙。我们需要的是真正永久的和平，而不是一时的虚伪的和平。我们读到了中国共产党主席毛泽东先生对时局声明的八项和平条件，确认为是达到真正永久民主和平的基本条件。本会愿竭诚拥护，为促其全部实现而共同奋斗到底。
