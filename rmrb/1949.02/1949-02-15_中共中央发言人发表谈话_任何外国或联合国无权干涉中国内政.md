　　Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, February 12th: The conspiracy of foreign imperialists, led by the United States, to interfere in China's internal affairs is still active in cooperation with the Kuomintang reactionary traitorous clique. On the 9th of this month, Australian Foreign Minister Evatt delivered a speech on foreign policy in Congress, suggesting that the United Nations mediate the Chinese civil war. On the 11th, Sun Ke, the pseudo-Executive Yuan President of the Kuomintang, immediately echoed this at a reception for foreign journalists in Guangzhou, declaring that "mediation by the United Nations may be the only practical way to achieve domestic peace in our country." Reactionaries such as Pan Gongzhan in Shanghai and Nanjing also responded at the same time. This suspicious situation has given rise to rumors that the Kuomintang Ministry of Foreign Affairs knew about Evatt's proposal in advance. A spokesperson for the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China issued a statement on this, stating: No foreign government or United Nations organization has any right whatsoever to interfere in China's internal affairs. The Australian Foreign Minister's suggestion that the United Nations interfere in China's internal affairs is absurd and insulting to the Chinese people. The shameful remarks of Sun Ke and Pan Gongzhan, spokespersons for the Kuomintang reactionary traitorous clique, merely express their consistent traitorous stance. After the Nanjing Kuomintang traitorous government's request for interference from the governments of the United States, Britain, France, and the Soviet Union failed on January 8th, it is still dreaming of new international interference. However, any such attempt, no matter where it comes from or under what name it is taken, will only be met with the resolute opposition of the Chinese people.

　　中共中央发言人发表谈话
  　任何外国或联合国无权干涉中国内政
    【新华社陕北十二日电】以美国为首的外国帝国主义者出面干涉中国内政的阴谋，仍在国民党反动卖国集团的合作之下活动。本月九日，澳大利亚外交部长伊瓦特在国会发表外交政策演说，建议联合国调停中国内战。十一日，国民党伪行政院长孙科，即在广州招待外国记者予以附和。宣称“联合国之调处或为获致我国国内和平之唯一实用途径”。上海和南京的反动分子潘公展等人，也在同时予以响应。这种可疑的情况，引起了国民党外交部事先知悉伊瓦特建议的风传。中国共产党中央发言人对此发表谈话称：任何外国政府或联合国组织，绝对无权干涉中国的内政。澳大利亚外长关于由联合国干涉中国内政的建议，是荒谬的和侮辱中国人民的。国民党反动卖国集团发言人孙科、潘公展之流的可耻谈话，不过是表示他们一贯的卖国的立场。南京国民党卖国政府在其一月八日向美英法苏四国政府要求干涉失败之后，仍在梦想新的国际干涉。但是任何这一类的企图，无论其出于何方及采取何种名义，都只能遭受中国人民的坚决反对。
