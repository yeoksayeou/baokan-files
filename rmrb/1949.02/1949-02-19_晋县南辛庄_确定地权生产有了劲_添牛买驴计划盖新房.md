　　Jin County, Nanxinzhuang
　　Determination of Land Rights Spurs Production
　　Plans to Add Cattle and Buy Donkeys, Build New Houses
　　[Jinzhong Telegram] After achieving liberation, the peasants of Nanxinzhuang in Jin County reaped a bumper harvest last year. Following the determination of land rights, they are actively developing production and purchasing farm implements and draught animals. Thanks to the peasants' intensive farming, the village's harvest last year exceeded any year since the War of Resistance Against Japan. Poor peasant Wang Ruihua used to be a beggar, and his two younger sisters were forced to be sold. After being allocated land last year, he weeded the spring seedlings three times and the late seedlings twice, leaving no weeds in the fields. His sixteen mu of crops yielded twenty-four sacks (one sack contains eight shi or bushels), equivalent to nineteen shi and two dou of grain. After deducting the family's annual food and clothing expenses and the public grain, he still had ten sacks left over. Last winter, his mother spun yarn, and Wang Ruihua himself made tofu, earning two shi of beans. He used the bean dregs to feed pigs and accumulated eight large carts of manure. Last year, he received a donkey leg as his share, and now he has bought two-tenths of a cow. Su Lao Xin, who has worked as a hired laborer for half his life, cultivated his crops to a standard of "two plows and three weedings," yielding forty-two sacks of grain from thirty-five mu of land. After deducting food, clothing, and public grain, he still had twenty-three sacks left over. He has now bought a weaving machine, a large cart, and a drill plow, and has purchased timber for three rooms in preparation for building a house in the spring. He also replaced half of an old mule with a large cow, is raising two pigs, and has accumulated fourteen carts of manure. The middle peasant Cui Zhiqin's family of thirty-six people cultivated one hundred and thirty-eight mu of land. Last year, during the drought, the men led the livestock to water the fields, while the women used waterwheels to irrigate the fields near the village. Last year's harvest was so abundant that the entire family could not finish eating it in a year and a half. They are now busy accumulating manure, delivering manure and pulling soil to the fields three times every morning. They have also added a donkey. During the land reform last year, the village had enough livestock to allocate one head to every seven or eight households. Due to the bumper harvest and active winter production, the number of livestock has increased further, now averaging one head per three households. In total, the village added twenty-two head of cattle, nine donkeys, two mules, and four horses last winter. Twelve households built houses last autumn, and another fourteen households are planning to build houses this spring, laying a foundation for a major production increase this year.

　　晋县南辛庄
  　确定地权生产有了劲
  　添牛买驴计划盖新房
    【晋中电】晋县南辛庄翻身农民，去年得到丰收，确定地权后，积极开展生产，购置农具耕畜。由于农民的精耕细作，该村去年的收成，超过抗日战争以来的任何一年。贫农王瑞华过去经常要饭吃，两个妹妹被迫卖了。去年分得土地后，春苗锄了三遍，晚苗锄了二遍，地里没有一棵草，十六亩庄稼打下二十四口袋（一口袋有八市斗）即十九石二斗粮食。除全家全年吃穿及交公粮外，还余十口袋。去年的冬季母亲纺线，王瑞华自己作豆腐，赚了豆子两石，豆渣子养猪，并积肥八大车，去年分了一条驴腿，现在又买了十分之二的牛。做了半辈长活的宿老新，去年庄稼作到了耕二锄三，三十五亩地打了四十二口袋粮食，除了吃穿出公粮外，还剩下二十三口袋。现在买了织布机一架、大车一辆、耧一个，并买了三间房的木料准备开春盖房，把半个老骡子也换成了个大母牛，养猪二口，积肥十四车。中农崔志琴家三十六口人，种地一百三十八亩，去年天旱时男子领着牲口浇地，妇女们在近地里推水车浇地，去年的收成全家一年半也吃不清。现在正忙着积肥，每天清早往地里送粪、拉土，来回三趟。现又增加了驴一头。去年土地改革时，该村七、八家可分到一头牲口，因为年景丰收及冬季积极生产。牲畜又有新的增加，现三家可平均一头。总计全村去冬共添牛二十二头，驴九头，骡子二头，马四匹。去年秋后十二户盖了房子，今春盖房子的又有十四户，今年大生产已打下了基础。
