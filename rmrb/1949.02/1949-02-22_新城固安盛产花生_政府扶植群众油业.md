[Jizhong Telegram] Since the liberation of the Tenth District, the oil industry production has gradually recovered with the support of the state-owned Taichang Store. The vast area of the Tenth District produces a large number of peanuts every year, and the oil industry is very developed. Local people mostly engage in this type of production in the spring and autumn seasons. According to incomplete statistics from Gu'an, Xincheng, Jinwu, and Yongqing counties, there are 480 oil mills. At the same time, these areas produce an average of over 30 million jin of peanuts each year. If these oil mills were all operating, they could produce more than 70,000 jin of white oil per day. However, in the past ten years or so, due to the plunder and destruction by Japanese imperialism and the Kuomintang reactionary government and army, farmers lacked capital and were affected by high prices in enemy-occupied areas, most of the oil industry was brought to a standstill. In Yongqing County, there were a total of more than 230 oil mills, but less than 30 are still open, and they are barely surviving with very low production profits. Since the start of the Pingjin Campaign, the Tenth District has been completely liberated. In order to restore and develop the local oil industry production, our state-owned Taichang Store first stabilized prices to purchase existing white oil from oil mills, and supplied raw materials in large quantities to solve their capital difficulties. Branches One and Five adopted three specific methods in directly supporting the oil industry production: First, ordering - signing contracts with oil mills, agreeing on time and price, and the store paying a portion of the capital in advance; Second, exchange - using raw materials or food grains to exchange for their white oil; Third, manual labor - organizing poor farmers, setting up old oil presses, the store providing raw materials, and after the oil is pressed, issuing in-kind manual labor fees. In this way, not only were the production and living problems of many poor farmers solved, but the development of the oil industry was greatly supported. Now, oil mills in Gu'an, Daxing, Yongqing, Xincheng and other places are coming to our public store one after another, requesting to sign contracts to resume production. In just seven days, 42 oil mills have contacted the store, signed contracts, and delivered more than 20,000 jin of white oil.

　　新城固安盛产花生
  　政府扶植群众油业
    【冀中电】十分区解放后，经国营泰昌商店扶植，油业生产逐渐恢复。十分区广大地区，每年出产花生很多，油业很发达，当地群众在春秋两季便多从事这种生产。据固安、新城、津武、永清四个县的不完全统计，就有油坊四百八十多座。同时这些地区每年所产花生平均在三千万斤以上。如这些油坊都活动起来，每日便可出产白油七万多斤。但是在近十几年来，由于日本帝国主义及国民党反动政府与军队的掠夺破坏，农民缺乏资本和敌占时受物价高涨的影响，油业大部陷于停顿状态，永清全县共有二百三十多座油坊，现在开着的还不到三十座，而且都是勉强支持着，生产利润也很低。从平津战役开始后，十分区全部获得解放，我国营泰昌商店，为了恢复发展当地油业生产，使首先进行稳价收买油坊现存的白油，并大批供给原料，以解决其资本困难。一、五分店，在直接扶植油业生产中，采取三种具体办法：一、定购与油坊订立合同，约定时间价格，商店预付一部分资本；二、交换是以原料或食粮交换其白油；三、打手工——把贫苦农民组织起来，搭起旧油槽，商店供给原料，打成油后，发给实物手工费。这样一来，不但解决了不少贫苦农民的生产生活问题，并大大扶植了油业的发展。现在固安、大兴、永清、新城等地的油坊，纷纷找我公营商店，要求订立合同恢复生产。只七天的工夫，就有四十二个油坊与商店取上联系，订好合同，并交到白油两万多斤。
