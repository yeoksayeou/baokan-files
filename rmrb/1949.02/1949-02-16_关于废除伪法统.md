　　On Abolishing the Pseudo-Legal System

　　Question: What does the Kuomintang government mean by "legal system"? Why did Chairman Mao Zedong of the Chinese Communist Party propose "abolishing the pseudo-legal system" as one of the conditions for achieving peace in his statement on the current situation on January 14th?

　　Answer: The so-called "legal system" of the Kuomintang government refers to the legal origin of the Kuomintang's ruling power. The Kuomintang reactionaries deceive the people by saying that their anti-people rule is "legal" and "orthodox." They deceive the people by saying that the Kuomintang's ruling power is based on the "Constitution" promulgated by the Kuomintang government on New Year's Day in 1947; this "Constitution" is based on the "National Assembly" convened by the Kuomintang government in November 1946; this "National Assembly" is based on the "Provisional Constitution for the Period of Political Tutelage" promulgated and implemented by the Kuomintang government in June 1931; and so on, tracing back to the establishment of the Kuomintang. Chiang Kai-shek, the ringleader of the Kuomintang bandit gang and the No. 1 war criminal, put forward "as long as the legal system is not interrupted" as one of the conditions for "peace" in his New Year's Day message this year. Its meaning is to require the people to recognize the Kuomintang's counter-revolutionary rule as orthodox, to require the people to recognize the "legal" status of the Kuomintang government, so as not to undermine this counter-revolutionary rule, thereby preserving the Kuomintang's counter-revolutionary forces and counter-revolutionary ruling system. This absurd demand of the Kuomintang bandit gang and its chieftain Chiang Kai-shek is absolutely unacceptable to the people. The old ruling class and its apologists often spread a deception that there must first be a certain legal system, a certain constitutional and legal tradition, and then a certain state power is generated based on this traditional constitution and law. This deception is completely inconsistent with the truth of history. The truth of history is that any legal system, any constitution and law, in a class society, can only be created by a certain class in the class struggle, and created after obtaining state power, so as to systematically express the nature of this state power, and express the relationship between classes in a certain historical period. The basis of this relationship is the relationship of production, that is, the relationship of possession of the means of production. Any state power is a systematic dictatorship exercised by a certain class or alliance of classes that occupy the main means of production over other classes by violence, so as to protect the interests of one or several classes and suppress the resistance of the ruled classes. What kind of state power there is, what kind of constitutional and legal system there is, and what kind of legal system there is. The ruled class must overthrow the violence of the old ruling class by violence in order to seize state power. Therefore, the revolutionary class must abolish the counter-revolutionary legal system of the counter-revolutionary ruling class and re-establish its own revolutionary legal system. What is the true content of the Kuomintang government's so-called legal system? It claims that its legal system inherits the Nanjing Provisional Government after the Xinhai Revolution and the Guangzhou and Wuhan governments from 1925 to 1927. In fact, the Nanjing Provisional Government after the Xinhai Revolution was a dictatorship with old democratic characteristics jointly formed by a part of the bourgeoisie and a part of the landlord class; however, this regime only existed for more than a month before it was seized by the feudal warlord Yuan Shikai. The governments of Guangzhou and Wuhan from 1925 to 1927 were dictatorships with varying degrees of new democratic characteristics jointly formed by the proletariat to varying degrees, the petty bourgeoisie, the bourgeoisie, and a part of the landlord class; however, this regime was overthrown after the Kuomintang, headed by Chiang Kai-shek and Wang Jingwei, launched a bloody coup from April to July 1927. The Kuomintang reactionaries betrayed the revolution, betrayed Sun Yat-sen and the revolutionary Three People's Principles he formulated at the First National Congress of the Chinese Kuomintang in 1924, massacred the people, defected to imperialism, and established a terrifying counter-revolutionary dictatorship of the great landlords and great bourgeoisie over the people of the whole country. This counter-revolutionary dictatorship is so isolated that every link in Chiang Kai-shek's so-called "legal system" inheritance has to be implemented by means of conspiratorial coups, terror, bribery, and forgery. Therefore, not only the masses of the people have never recognized his so-called legal system, but even the liberal bourgeoisie and some people within the Kuomintang are unwilling to recognize it. What the Chiang Kai-shek group inherited is essentially the counter-revolutionary tradition of feudal comprador classes such as Zeng Guofan and Yuan Shikai, who sold out the motherland to foreign countries and harmed the people internally. However, the incomplete revolutionary tradition since the Taiping Heavenly Kingdom, through the Xinhai Revolution, to the Great Revolution from 1925 to 1927, has been inherited and carried forward by the Chinese Communist Party, which has continued to adhere to the revolution since 1927. Under the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party, the Chinese people have not only inherited the incomplete revolutionary traditions of the past, but are also establishing their own completely revolutionary new traditions, that is, revolutionary legal systems, with completely new revolutionary struggles. The Chiang Kai-shek group opposes the revolutionary power because it wants to stubbornly preserve its counter-revolutionary power, so it does not recognize the revolutionary legal system but insists on its counter-revolutionary legal system. Chairman Mao's statement on the current situation on January 14th proposed "abolishing the pseudo-legal system" as the third of the eight peace conditions, which directly shattered the conspiracy of the Kuomintang bandit gang and chieftain Chiang Kai-shek to preserve counter-revolutionary forces. The essence of this condition announced by Chairman Mao on behalf of the common will of the people of the whole country is to demand the thorough overthrow of the Kuomintang's traitorous and dictatorial counter-revolutionary rule, that is to say, all laws, regulations, political systems, political institutions, and political powers formulated and established under the rule of the Kuomintang reactionary government are invalid, and the people cannot recognize them at all. On the basis of thoroughly overthrowing the Kuomintang's counter-revolutionary rule, the Chinese people will establish an independent, unified, democratic, prosperous, and strong new China of people's democracy, namely the People's Republic of China. This people's democratic regime represents the overwhelming majority of the people of the country, including workers, peasants, independent laborers, handicraftsmen, intellectuals, the liberal bourgeoisie, and enlightened gentry. What is the source of power of this people's democratic regime? It is not based on any previously existing constitution and legal system, nor is it based on any previously existing legal system. It is the result of the victory of the anti-imperialist, anti-feudal, and anti-bureaucratic capital revolution of the masses of the people (based on the worker-peasant alliance) led by the proletariat.

### 关于废除伪法统

　　关于废除伪法统
    问：国民党政府所说的“法统”是什么意思？中国共产党毛泽东主席在一月十四日的对时局声明中为什么提出“废除伪法统”作为实现和平的条件之一？
    答：国民党政府的所谓“法统”，是指国民党统治权力在法律上的来源而言。国民党反动派欺骗人民说：他们的反人民的统治是“合法”的“正统”。他们欺骗人民说：国民党的统治权力，是根据一九四七年元旦国民党政府颁布的“宪法”；这个“宪法”，是根据一九四六年十一月国民党政府召开的“国民大会”；这个“国民大会”，是根据一九三一年六月国民党政府公布施行的“训政时期约法”；如是等等，并向上追溯而一直至于国民党的成立。国民党匪帮首领、第一号战犯蒋介石在今年元旦的求和文告中，提出了“只要法统不致中断”作为“和平”的条件之一，其意思就是要求人民承认国民党的反革命统治为正统，要求人民承认国民党政府的“合法”地位，因而不去破坏这个反革命的统治，借此保存国民党的反革命的势力和反革命的统治制度。国民党匪帮及其匪首蒋介石的这种荒谬要求是人民所绝对不能允许的。旧统治阶级及其辩护者常常散布一种欺骗，似乎先有一定的法统，一定的宪法和法律的传统，然后才根据这种传统的宪法和法律而产生某种国家政权。这种欺骗是与历史的真相完全不符的。历史的真相是：任何法统，任何宪法和法律，在阶级社会中只能由一定的阶级在阶级斗争中来创造，在取得国家政权以后来创造，借以有系统地表现这种国家政权的性质，表现一定历史时期中阶级与阶级的关系，这种关系的基础乃是生产关系即对于生产资料的占有关系。任何国家政权都是一定的占有主要生产资料的阶级或阶级的联盟用暴力来对于其他阶级施行有系统的专政，借以保护这一个或几个阶级的利益，并镇压被统治阶级的反抗的机关。有了什么样性质的国家政权，才有什么样的宪法和法律系统，才有什么样的法统。被统治阶级必须用暴力推翻旧的统治阶级的暴力，才能夺取国家政权。因此，革命的阶级必须废除反革命统治阶级的反革命法统，从新建立自己的革命法统。国民党政府的所谓法统的真实内容是什么呢？它自称其法统上承辛亥革命后的南京临时政府和一九二五年至一九二七年的广州和武汉政府。事实上，辛亥革命后的南京临时政府是一部分资产阶级和一部分地主阶级联合的带有旧民主主义色彩的专政；但是这个政权只存在了一个多月，就被封建军阀袁世凯所夺取。一九二五年至一九二七年广州和武汉的政府是无产阶级在不同程度上参加了的，小资产阶级、资产阶级以及一部分地主阶级联合的，带有不同程度的新民主主义色彩的专政；但是这个政权由于一九二七年四月至七月以蒋介石、汪精卫为首的国民党举行了血腥的政变以后，就被推翻了。国民党反动派背叛了革命，背叛了孙中山和他在一九二四年中国国民党第一次全国代表大会时订定的革命的三民主义，屠杀了人民，投靠了帝国主义，而建立了大地主大资产阶级对于全国人民的恐怖的反革命专政。这个反革命专政是如此孤立，以至蒋介石的所谓“法统”继承的每个关节，都不得不用阴谋的政变、恐怖、贿买、伪造等方法来实行。因此，不但人民大众从来不承认他的所谓法统，就连自由资产阶级和国民党内的某些人也不愿意加以承认。蒋介石集团所继承的，实质上是曾国藩、袁世凯等封建买办阶级对外出卖祖国对内残害人民的反革命传统。而自太平天国以来，经过辛亥革命以至一九二五年至一九二七年大革命的不完全的革命传统，则已由在一九二七年以后继续坚持革命的中国共产党所继承和发扬光大。中国人民在中国共产党的领导之下，不但继承了过去的不完全的革命传统，而且正在用完全新式的革命斗争建立着自己的完全革命的新传统，也就是革命的法统。蒋介石集团因为要坚持地保存其反革命的权力而反抗革命的权力，所以不承认革命的法统而坚持其反革命的法统。毛主席一月十四日对时局的声明，提出了“废除伪法统”作为八项和平条件的第三个条件，这就直截了当地粉碎了国民党匪帮和匪首蒋介石企图保存反革命势力的阴谋。毛主席代表全国人民公意所宣布的这个条件的实质，就是要求彻底地推翻国民党的卖国独裁的反革命统治，这就是说，在国民党反动政府统治下制订和建立的一切法律、典章、政治制度、政治机构、政治权力等均归无效，人民完全不能承认它们。中国人民在彻底地推翻国民党反革命统治的基础上，即将建立独立、统一、民主、富强的人民民主的新中国，即中华人民民主共和国。这个人民民主政权代表全国绝大多数人民，包括工人、农民、独立劳动者、手工业者、知识分子、自由资产阶级和开明士绅。什么是这个人民民主政权的权力来源呢？它不是根据任何先前存在的宪法和法律系统，不是根据任何先前存在的法统，它是无产阶级领导的、人民大众的（以工农联盟为基础的）反帝反封建反官僚资本的大革命的胜利的结果。（新华社陕北十四日电）
