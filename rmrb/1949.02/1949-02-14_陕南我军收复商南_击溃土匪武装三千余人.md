　　Xinhua News Agency, Central Plains, 12th: After a unit of the People's Liberation Army routed more than 3,000 local reactionary armed bandits led by Bai Qingyun and Ren Xiaotu in the border area of Henan and Shaanxi on the 6th, it seized the opportunity to recover Shangnan County in southern Shaanxi on the 7th. The results of the battle are currently being investigated.
    Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 12th: Working women in Jiangsu, Anhui, and the cities of Luoyang and Kaifeng in Henan Province contributed significantly to the Huaihai Campaign, in which the People's Liberation Army annihilated more than 600,000 enemies. In November and December of last year, 600,000 women in eight counties, including Lianshui, Suqian, Guanyun, and Huaiyin, ground more than 10.34 million jin of flour for the People's Liberation Army; about 8,600 women transported more than 600,000 jin of grain; and 551 women participated in stretcher teams dedicated to transporting the wounded. They also participated in building roads for the People's Liberation Army in the severe cold. According to statistics from three districts of Huaiyin County alone, more than 2,000 women repaired the road from Huaiyin to Shuyang, repairing 70 li in three days. Many female cadres led laborers to participate in frontline work. For example, Du Da Niang, the deputy township chief of Sunyuan Township in Sinan County (newly established county south of Siyang County), led 70 donkeys to take on frontline transportation tasks. Huang Cuiping, a female instructor in Chenxu District of the county, was wounded by enemy aircraft bombing when she volunteered for the second time to lead a stretcher team to the front, but she still insisted on leading the stretcher team to a safe area. Li Yonglan, the female squad leader of the Duanqin Transportation Team in Daxing Town, Daxing District, Suqian County, was awarded the "Support-the-Front Model" medal by the Huaihai Sub-district Support-the-Front Command for her hard work and initiative, which enabled the laborers of the entire squad to consolidate unity and persist in completing their tasks. At that time, in order to ensure the supply of clothing and shoes for the soldiers on the Huaihai front, tens of thousands of women in Luoyang, Kaifeng, Zhengzhou, Bozhou, Fuyang, and other places launched an unprecedentedly enthusiastic campaign to make military shoes and military uniforms. More than 6,400 women in Luoyang City, in cooperation with more than 500 shoe factory workers, made more than 140,000 pairs of military shoes in 40 days. Women in Bozhou rushed to make more than 29,000 quilts in 15 days. Because of their talent displayed in supporting the front and production activities, many outstanding individuals were promoted to cadres. According to statistics from Sishu County (newly established county, formerly parts of Siyang and Shuyang) in just one and a half months, a total of 13 female district cadres, 163 female township and village chiefs and deputy chiefs were promoted, and 284 women were elected as township or village farmer association chairpersons.

　　陕南我军收复商南
    击溃土匪武装三千余人
    【新华社中原十二日电】解放军一部，六日在豫陕交界处击溃国民党地方反动武装白青云、任小秃匪部三千余人后，于七日乘胜收复陕南的商南县城，战果正清查中。
    【新华社陕北十二日电】江苏安徽和洛阳、开封等省市劳动妇女，在解放军歼敌六十多万的淮海战役中，贡献了很大的力量。去年十一、十二两月内，涟水、宿迁、灌云、淮阴等八县内，有六十万妇女为解放军磨面一千零三十四万多斤，约八千六百个妇女运送粮食六十万多斤，五百五十一个妇女参加了担架队专运伤员。她们并在严寒中参加为解放军修筑公路，仅据淮阴县三个区的统计，有两千多个妇女修复淮阴到沭阳的公路，三天中就修复了七十里。不少妇女干部带领民工参加前线工作，如泗南县（泗县南部，新设县）孙园乡副乡长杜大娘，带领了七十头驴子担任前方运输任务。该县陈圩区女指导员黄翠平在第二次自动报名带领担架队上前方时，遭受敌机轰炸负伤，仍坚持带领担架队转移到安全地带。宿迁县大兴区大兴镇短勤运输队女分队长李永兰因吃苦耐劳，积极起带头作用，使全分队民工能很好地巩固团结，坚持完成任务，得到了淮海分区支援前线司令部“支前模范”的奖章。当时，为保证淮海前线战士衣鞋供给，洛阳、开封、郑州、亳州、阜阳等地数万妇女开展了空前热烈的做军鞋、做军衣运动，洛阳市六千四百多妇女配合五百多鞋厂工人，在四十天中作成军鞋十四万多双。亳州妇女在十五天中赶做了被褥二万九千多床。由于她们在支援前线和生产活动表现出才能，不少优秀分子被提拔作了干部。仅据泗沭（新设县，原泗阳、沭阳各一部）县一个半月的统计，共提拔了女区干部十三人，正副女乡长、村长共一百六十三人，并有二百八十四个妇女被选为乡或村的农会长。
