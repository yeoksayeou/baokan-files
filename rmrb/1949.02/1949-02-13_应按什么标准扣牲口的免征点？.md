Inquiries and Answers

Editor:
    I. I saw in your newspaper on December 31st that the reply regarding the deduction of tax exemption points for small cattle and donkeys in Niuchuan Village, Second District of Heshun, was four dou. The autumn tax collection instructions in the North China Daily state that cattle and donkeys should be deducted six dou, mules and horses ten dou, and people also ten dou. Which one is correct?
    II. A military family has livestock but no labor. When they are called for war service, the village sends someone to accompany the livestock, but the livestock owner has to provide the food. The military family is already very difficult, and this further increases their burden. But if they don't provide food, no one can be sent, and they can't refuse to serve in the war. What is the solution?

    In our newspaper No. 201, first page, under the title "North China Government Announces New Agricultural Tax Regulations," Article 12, paragraph 1 of Chapter III states, "Revolutionary soldiers, revolutionary cadres, and martyrs shall have their tax exemption points deducted in their respective homes." However, in Article 13, paragraph 1 of the same chapter, it states, "Those who are away from home year-round and whose living expenses are not provided by their families shall not have tax exemption points deducted." After reading this, we feel that the meanings are somewhat contradictory. Who are those who are away from home year-round and whose living expenses are not provided by their families? Are revolutionary soldiers, who are also away from home year-round and whose living expenses are not provided by their families, excluded? Please answer our question.

Comrade Zhen Xi:
    I. The original draft tax regulations stipulated that the deduction for livestock consumption was six market dou (of grain) for cattle and donkeys, and ten market dou for mules and horses. After further research, it was considered that households without livestock were at a disadvantage, and it was changed to four market dou for cattle and donkeys, and seven market dou for mules and horses. Article 14 of the newly promulgated North China Region Provisional Agricultural Tax Regulations states: (1) Each head of cattle or donkey shall be deducted by four-tenths of a standard mu. (2) Each head of mule or horse shall be deducted by seven-tenths of a standard mu. That is how it is stipulated, and from now on, things should be done according to the tax regulations.
    II. It is very wrong that military families only have livestock but no labor, and that they have to provide food in order for someone else to accompany the livestock for service, thus increasing the burden on the families of military personnel and martyrs. In the future, the village should improve the service work. For households with livestock but no labor, the village should assign households with labor to accompany the livestock, and ensure that their livestock do not suffer undue losses.
Comrades Wenqing and Hengshun:
    Article 13, paragraph 1 of the tax regulations: "Those who are away from home year-round and whose living expenses are not provided by their families shall not have tax exemption points deducted," refers to ordinary people who are away from home year-round and whose living expenses are not provided by their families. Such as workers, merchants, freelancers, etc. As for revolutionary soldiers and revolutionary cadres, although they are also away from home year-round and their living expenses are not provided by their families, in order to take care of their dedication to the revolution, their inability to participate in production at home, and their low living standards, it is specifically stipulated that tax exemption points should be deducted to show consideration.

### 应按什么标准扣牲口的免征点？

专栏：询问与答复

　　应按什么标准扣牲口的免征点？编辑同志：
    一、我看到十二月三十一号咱报上答复和顺二区牛川村小牛小驴扣免税点是按四斗。北岳日报上的秋征指示是牛、驴扣六斗，骡、马扣十斗，人也是扣十斗。到底那一个对？
    二、军属家里有牲口但没劳动力，出战勤的时候，村里派了人跟上牲口，但是让牲口主出干粮，本来军属家里就很困难，这样更加重军属的负担。但不出干粮又派不出人来，又不能不出战勤，怎么办好，请答复一下。　振喜编辑同志：
    咱报上第二○一号第一版“华北政府公布新农业税则”一题，本文第三章第十二条第一款“革命军人革命职员及烈士，均在其本人家中扣除免税点。”但在本章第十三条第一款却是“常年在外，其生活并不由家庭供给者不扣除免税点。”我们看后觉得前后意思有些矛盾。那么常年在外其生活并不由家庭供给者是指那些人？革命军人也是常年在外其生活不由家庭供给者是否除外呢？请答复为祷。
    　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　王文清、郑恒顺振喜同志：
    一、原拟税则草案规定牲口扣除消耗，牛驴是六市斗，骡马是十市斗（谷）。后经研究，认为无牲口户太吃亏，而改为牛驴四市斗，骡马七市斗。新颁布的华北区农业税暂行税则第十四条：（一）牛驴每头扣除一个标准亩的十分之四。（二）骡马每头扣除一个标准亩的十分之七。就是这样规定的，以后就应当照税则办事。
    二、军属只有牲口没有劳动力，牲口服勤必须赔上干粮才能另派别人跟牲口，以致加重了军工烈属的负担，这是很不对的。今后村上应该将服勤工作搞好，有牲口无劳力户的牲口支差，应派有劳力户跟牲口，并保证其牲口不受不应受的损失。文清、恒顺同志：
    税则第十三条第一项：“常年在外，其生活并不由家庭供给者，不扣除免税点。”系指一般群众常年在外，其生活并不由家庭供给者而言。如工人、商人、自由职业者等等。至于革命军人、革命职员虽然亦是常年在外，其生活并不由家庭供给，但为了照顾其献身革命，不能在家参加生产，生活待遇又低，特明文规定扣除免税点，以示照顾。　华北人民政府财政部
