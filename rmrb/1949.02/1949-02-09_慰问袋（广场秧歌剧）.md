Comfort Bag (Square Yangko Opera)
　　By Huangfu Shuyu
　　Characters: Two sisters-in-law.
　　Opening: The sound of gongs and drums stops, the sister-in-law walks out of the crowd, stepping to the rhythm of the music, lively and cheerful.
　　Sister-in-law: (Sings the first song) (1) The red, red sun, the clear, clear sky, beating gongs and drums to celebrate the New Year. Women's associations, children's groups, one by one wearing new clothes, the liberated people are truly happy.
　　(2) My husband has been in the army for two full years, a hero in killing the enemy, a great victory report posted on the door, with drums and trumpets to congratulate him, everyone says I am a glorious military family member.
　　(3) As the saying goes, good vegetables can fill you up, working women are better than men, farming work, done by ourselves, no need for a cultivation team to take care of us, we want to be models like our husbands.
　　(4) My husband wrote to me saying that the national victory will be this year, he told me not to worry, to concentrate on production, eliminate all the reactionaries and then reunite.
　　(When the sister-in-law sings the fourth verse, she takes out her husband's letter, looks at it repeatedly, and then reads each word awkwardly, guessing at the words she doesn't recognize. The younger sister quietly sneaks up, hiding behind her to peek, suppressing her laughter.)
　　Sister-in-law: (Reading the letter) "Fengying: (Pauses slightly, very excitedly.) I'll tell you something big first: Within a year, we will defeat (muttering to herself, guessing that the word is "defeat" from the words "lose," "run away," "die," etc., and using her finger to trace the writing of the word "defeat" in the air.) Chiang Kai-shek. Now we have captured Beijing and Tianjin (the word "Jin" is guessed correctly). When attacking Zhangjiakou, I made another contribution. I think you will be happy to hear that. I hope you don't worry about me, and concentrate on... (Repeatedly reads these four words, not recognizing the word 'gao' (搞).)"
　　Younger sister: (Reading aloud) "Concentrate on production, eliminate all the reactionaries and meet again." Right?
　　Sister-in-law: (Startled, then both laugh) My dear sister, you scared me to death!
　　Younger sister: How many times do you want to read your brother's letter? I saw you read it three times already. (Making a gesture in front of the sister-in-law's face.)
　　Sister-in-law: I'm learning to read and write!
　　Younger sister: I know, sister-in-law has a good learning spirit and won an award in winter school. But, you're lying this time, tell the truth! You miss my brother...
　　Sister-in-law: (Quickly says) I think your brother has won a battle, made a contribution, he is a hero, we are also glorious, another victory report is coming, everyone is congratulating him...
　　Younger sister: This "la," that "la"... (Interrupting the sister-in-law) I say, sister-in-law, didn't brother write to you saying that the national victory is this year, they want to capture Chiang Kai-shek alive, to fight to the end and eliminate the reactionaries completely? The soldiers at the front are fighting hard, so we can happily celebrate the New Year at home. The teacher said, don't forget the soldiers fighting at the front when celebrating the New Year. The village is launching a comfort campaign. Sister-in-law, what kind of gifts are you planning to send?
　　Sister-in-law: I haven't decided yet, let me see yours first!
　　Younger sister: (Pointing to the comfort bag she's carrying) I'm sending this.
　　Sister-in-law: (Pretending to be surprised) Ah! People are sending pigs, sheep, chickens, towels, soap… how can you send a cloth bag!?
　　Younger sister: (Quick verse) This is called a comfort bag, the soldiers like it very much, first, it's for carrying things, second, it's a memento, the words written on it, they will always remember in their hearts, sent by the masses, they treat it as a treasure. Just this bag doesn't count, there are many things inside.
　　Sister-in-law: What kind of things are inside?
　　Younger sister: Long, short, round, flat, everything, guess?
　　Sister-in-law: It turns out it's a trick bag, who knows what kind of tricks you're going to pull out? I can't guess, and I won't guess!
　　Younger sister: Let me show you.
　　(The sister-in-law unties the bag, taking out one item at a time, the two sing the second song in duet.)
　　Sister-in-law: (Takes out a bunch of white thread, sings) Why send this bunch of thread?
　　Younger sister: (Sings) Sewing and mending is very convenient.
　　Sister-in-law: (Takes out a package of needles, sings) Why send this package of needles?
　　Younger sister: (Sings) Sewing clothes and mending socks without asking for help.
　　Sister-in-law: (Takes out a small tobacco pipe, sings) Why send a small tobacco pipe?
　　Younger sister: (Sings) A puff of dry tobacco is very relaxing.
　　Sister-in-law: (Takes out a notebook, sings) What is this notebook for?
　　Younger sister: (Sings) To help the soldiers learn culture.
　　Sister-in-law: (Takes out a cloth clip, sings) What is this clip for?
　　Younger sister: (Sings) For clipping grain coupons and money for vegetables.
　　(At this point, immediately change the tune)
　　Sister-in-law: (Sings) Sister, you are really capable,
　　Younger sister: (Sings) Sister-in-law, don't praise me.
　　Sister-in-law: (Sings) The army fights for us,
　　Younger sister: (Sings) We should comfort them.
　　Both: (Sing) Aihai Aihai yo, this is what is called the army and the people as one family, um aiyo.
　　Younger sister: Sister-in-law, do you think this comfort bag is good?
　　Sister-in-law: Good, good, really good!
　　Younger sister: Make one for my brother, okay?
　　Sister-in-law: I spin thread and go to class, I can't spare time to make one.
　　Younger sister: You must make one!
　　Sister-in-law: I definitely won't make one!
　　Younger sister: (Anxiously) You must, must, must make one!
　　Sister-in-law: I definitely, definitely, definitely won't make one!
　　Younger sister: (Angrily) Sister-in-law, you are a model in production, a model in learning, but you are not a model in this! Look how hard my brother is fighting the enemy in this freezing weather! Others are comforting him! You are a loving couple, but you won't even make him a comfort bag, that's really unreasonable. I won't call you a good sister-in-law anymore! (Turns her face away, pouting, on the verge of crying.)
　　Sister-in-law: (Pulls the younger sister) Sister, you are so impatient, I already made one for him!
　　Younger sister: You're lying, you said you wouldn't make one for my brother!
　　Sister-in-law: If you don't believe me, look! (Suddenly takes out a large, brightly colored comfort bag from her pocket. The younger sister is overjoyed, snatching it and playing with it, turning it over and over. The two happily sing the third song in duet.)
　　Younger sister: (Sings) You already made the comfort bag, I shouldn't have made a fuss;
　　Sister-in-law: (Sings) Not much, not little, didn't sleep for two days and two nights.
　　Both: (Sing) Qibulong dong qiang yi qiang, didn't sleep.
　　Younger sister: (Sings) Embroidered on it is brother's name, Jiansheng, and below is sister-in-law's name, Fengying;
　　Sister-in-law: (Sings) In the middle is also embroidered seven words: Strive to kill the enemy and make great contributions.
　　Both: (Sing) Qibulong dong qiang yi qiang, make great contributions.
　　Younger sister: (Sings) A red star in the sky, the light of the red star shines in all directions;
　　Sister-in-law: (Sings) That red star is our Communist Party, that light shines on our good times.
　　Both: (Sing) Qibulong dong qiang yi qiang, good times.
　　Younger sister: (Sings) Peonies bloom, red flowers, heroes carry them on their chests;
　　Sister-in-law: (Sings) Those red flowers also need green leaves, heroes and the masses cannot be separated.
　　Both: (Sing) Qibulong dong qiang yi qiang, cannot be separated.
　　Younger sister: (Recites a quick verse) Sister-in-law, you are amazing, the comfort bag is made so exquisitely, strong and beautiful, everyone says you have good craftsmanship, send it to the front immediately, brother will be very happy to receive it, sister-in-law, I ask one more question, what do you plan to put inside?
　　Sister-in-law: (Quick verse) First, write a letter, ask about the good news from the front; Capture Chiang Kai-shek, let everyone vent their anger. Milling grain requires milling rice, revolution requires revolution to the end. Home affairs, don't ask, the masses are very concerned about us, I am a young person, don't need the masses to take care of me too much, farm work, diligent labor, carrying water and chopping wood I can do everything, eating and wearing are all good, and I also want to strive to be a female hero. Second, show him my award certificate, I am a model in spinning and weaving, the whole village praises me. Third, send a woolen vest, tightly against the back, tightly against the chest, not cold in winter, vigorous in battle. Fourth, buy a foreign porcelain bowl, sew a bowl cover, carry it by your side, first, it's hygienic, second, it's convenient. With these things prepared, sister, do you agree?
　　Younger sister: (Quick verse) I agree with all these things, but one good thing is missing.
　　Sister-in-law: What thing?
　　Younger sister: This thing is too important! Guess?
　　Sister-in-law: Sister, you're playing tricks again, I won't guess, tell me?
　　Younger sister: This time if you don't guess, I won't tell you.
　　Sister-in-law: (Sings the fourth song) Could it be that your brother is short of money, take a few People's Banknotes for him to spend?
　　Younger sister: Our army has clothes and shoes, and also issues subsidies, towels, and soap… no need for you to send People's Banknotes. That's not right, guess again.
　　Sister-in-law: Not right? (Sings) Could it be that your brother is working hard in battle, send him something delicious to improve his spirits?
　　Younger sister: Also not right! The troops often improve their lives, no need for you to send food from so far away.
　　Sister-in-law: This is also not right? I remember! (Sings) Could it be that the poor people are turning over in the land reform, send him the land certificate to make him happy?
　　Younger sister: Our family turned over and got land, brother already knows that, what's the point of sending it to the front? Not right, guess again.
　　Sister-in-law: Still not right? Oh dear, what a hard thing to guess! (Sings) Could it be that your brother has made a contribution in killing the enemy, call him to keep that big victory report?
　　Younger sister: (Laughs) Even more wrong, brother's victory report is for reporting the good news to sister-in-law, how can you send it back to brother again? Guess again!
　　Sister-in-law: (Unhappily) Three guesses, four guesses, and I still can't guess, I won't guess anymore!
　　Younger sister: Let me tell you, it's this good thing, (pointing to the sister-in-law's chest) you haven't put your heart into the bag yet!
　　Sister-in-law: (Laughs) You little rascal!
　　Younger sister: It's not me being a rascal, it's called husband and wife being of one mind. (The sister-in-law is about to hit her, she immediately changes her tone) No! It's called the front and the rear being of one mind!
　　(The sisters-in-law immediately sing the first song)
　　(1) The front fights bravely, (Together) the rear must step up production, (Together) the front and the rear, (Younger sister) are of one mind, (Sister-in-law) heart to heart, (Younger sister) cannot be separated, (Sister-in-law) hearts are connected to fight the enemy (Together).
　　(2) The power of the people is like an iron hammer, (Together) the reactionaries are now like eggs, (Together) Chiang Kai-shek, (Younger sister) will soon be finished, (Sister-in-law) a new China, (Younger sister) will be realized, (Sister-in-law) everyone welcomes the year of victory (Together).
　　(3) The village holds meetings to discuss, discuss how to comfort the army, (Together) comfort bags, (Younger sister) we will make them, (Sister-in-law) quickly prepare (Younger sister) to send the gifts, (Sister-in-law) model military families will not lag behind (Together).

　　慰问袋（广场秧歌剧）
    皇甫束玉作
    人物：姑嫂二人。
    开场：锣鼓声罢，嫂从人群中走出，踏着音乐节奏，活泼愉快。
    嫂：（唱第一曲）（一）红巴巴（的）太阳青格蓝蓝（的）天，敲锣打鼓闹新年，妇女会，儿童团，一个一个（把）新衣穿，翻身的人们真喜欢。
    （二）丈夫参军两年整，杀敌英雄头一名，大喜报，贴门庭，吹吹打打来贺功，都说俺军属真光荣。
    （三）常言好菜能顶饭，劳动妇女赛过汉，庄稼活，自己干，不用代耕队来照管，要和俺丈夫比模范。
    （四）丈夫来信对我言，全国胜利在今年，他叫我，莫挂念，一心一意闹生产，消灭尽反动派再团圆。
    （嫂唱第四节时，即掏出丈夫的信，反复观看，以后又较生涩的念着每个单字，间有不认识的字，则加以揣测。妹子悄悄的溜上，躲在她背后偷看，抑制着发笑。）
    嫂：（念信）“凤英：（略一停，十分兴奋。）先告你一件大事情：一年内，我们就要打垮（自言自语的从打‘败’‘跑’‘死’等字中，猜想着那是个垮字，并用手指在空中比划着垮字的写法。）蒋介石，现在我们已经打下北京和天津（津字是估计对的）在打张家口时，我又立了一功，想你听了一定高兴，望你不要挂念我，在家里一心一意………（反复念这四字，认不得那个搞字）”
    妹：（大声念）一心一意搞生产，消灭尽反动派再见面。对不对？
    嫂：（吓了一跳，接着就都笑了）我的妹子呀，你把人要吓死了！
    妹：哥哥这封信，你还想看几遍呢？我见你念过三回啦。（说着在嫂脸前比个手式。）
    嫂：我是认字、学文化哩！
    妹：我知道，嫂嫂学习精神好，冬学里得过奖状的。可是，你这一回是扯谎，说实话吧！你想我哥哥………
    嫂：（紧接着说）我想你哥哥打了胜仗啦，立下功劳啦，他当英雄啦，咱也光荣啦，喜报又来啦，都来贺功啦………。
    妹：（顺着嫂的口气）这个啦，那个啦……（打断嫂的发言）我说嫂嫂，哥哥不是来信告你说，全国大胜利就在今年，他们要活捉蒋介石，一股气打到底，把反动派消灭个一干二净。前方战士辛辛苦苦的打仗，咱才能在家快快乐乐的过年。先生说，过新年不要忘了前线杀敌的将士，村里正在发动慰劳，嫂嫂，你打算送些什么礼物呢？
    嫂：我还没想好，先看看你的吧！
    妹：（指带着的慰问袋）我送的就是这个。
    嫂：（故意惊讶）啊呀！人家是送猪呀，羊呀，鸡呀，手巾呀，肥皂呀…………你怎送一个布袋袋！？
    妹：（快板）这叫慰问袋，战士很喜欢，一来装东西，二来作纪念，上边写的话，永远记心间，群众亲手送，当作宝贝看。光这袋子还不算，还有好多东西在里边。
    嫂：里边装着些啥东西？
    妹：长的短的，圆的扁的，什么都有，你猜猜？
    嫂：原来是个耍把戏的口袋子，谁知你要变出啥玩艺来呢？我猜不着，我也不猜！
    妹：让你看一看。
    （嫂解开袋口，一件一件的掏出来，两人对唱第二曲）
    嫂：（取出一把白线，唱）为啥要送这把线？
    妹：（唱）缝缝补补顶方便。
    嫂：（取出一包针，唱）为啥要送这包针？
    妹：（唱）缝衣补袜不求人。
    嫂：（取出一个小烟袋，唱）为啥要送小烟袋？
    妹：（唱）吸口旱烟很轻快。
    嫂：（取出一个笔记本，唱）送这本子作什么？
    妹：（唱）帮助战士学文化。
    嫂：（取出一个布夹子，唱）送这包子作什么？
    妹：（唱）粮票菜金往里夹。
    （至此，紧接下调）
    嫂：（唱）妹妹办事真算话，
    妹：（唱）嫂嫂不要把我夸。
    嫂：（唱）军队打仗为了咱，
    妹：（唱）咱们应该慰劳他。
    合：（唱）唉嗨唉嗨哟，这才叫军民是一家嗯唉哟。
    妹：嫂嫂，你说这慰问袋好不好？
    嫂：好，好，真好！
    妹：你给我哥哥做一个吧？
    嫂：我又纺花，又上课，可顾不上做。
    妹：你一定得做！
    嫂：我一定不做！
    妹：（着急）你一定、一定、一定得做！
    嫂：我一定、一定、一定不做！
    妹：（生气）嫂嫂，你生产模范，学习模范，就是这点不模范！你看我哥哥在这冰天雪地里杀敌人，多么辛苦！别人都还慰问他呢！你们是恩爱夫妻，连个慰问袋都不肯给他做，真不讲道理，我以后不叫你好嫂嫂啦！（把脸一扭，噘着嘴，快要哭的样子。）
    嫂：（拉妹）妹妹，你好沉不住气，我早给他做好啦！
    妹：你扯谎，你说不给我哥哥做！
    嫂：不信，你看！（从衣袋里突然掏出一个大花慰问袋来，鲜艳夺目，妹大惊喜，夺在手翻来翻去的玩赏。两人高兴的对唱第三曲。）
    妹：（唱）慰问袋子早做好，不该惹我发牢骚；
    嫂：（唱）也不多来也不少，两明两夜没睡觉。
    合：（唱）七不龙冬锵一锵，没睡觉。
    妹：（唱）上绣着哥哥叫健生，下绣着嫂嫂叫凤英；
    嫂：（唱）中间还绣七个字：努力杀敌立大功。
    合：（唱）七不龙冬锵一锵，立大功。
    妹：（唱）一颗红星在天上，红星的光芒照四方；
    嫂：（唱）那红星就是咱共产党，那光芒照见咱好时光。
    合：（唱）七不龙冬锵一锵，好时光。
    妹：（唱）牡丹花开朵朵红，杀敌英雄带在胸；
    嫂：（唱）那红花还得绿叶衬，英雄和群众不能分。
    合：（唱）七不龙冬锵一锵，不能分。
    妹：（接念快板）嫂嫂你真了不起，慰问袋做的真精细，又结实，又美丽，那个不说你好手艺，马上送到前方去，哥哥接住好欢喜，嫂嫂我再问一句，打算装些啥东西？
    嫂：（快板）第一件，把信写，问问前方好消息；捉住蒋介石，大家出出气。碾谷就要碾出米，革命就要革到底。家中事，不用问，群众对咱挺关心，我是个，青年人，不要群众多照应，庄稼活，勤劳动，担水打柴我全行，吃的穿的全都好，还要争取女英雄。再说第二件，把我的奖状叫他看，纺织是模范，全村都称赞。再说第三件，送个毛背心，后边紧贴背，前边紧贴胸，冬天不受冷，打仗顶得劲。再说第四件，买个洋磁碗，缝个碗套子，挎在身旁边，一来讲卫生，二来也方便。这些东西准备起，妹子同意不同意？
    妹：（快板）这些东西都同意，还缺一件好东西。
    嫂：什么东西？
    妹：这件东西，太重要啦！你猜吧？
    嫂：妹子又变把戏啦，我不猜，你告我说吧？
    妹：这回你不猜我就不告你说。
    嫂：（唱第四曲）莫非是你哥哥花钱当紧，拿几张人民票给他零用。
    妹：咱军队里有穿有戴的，还要发津贴，发毛巾，发肥皂……，不用你捎人民票，这个不对，你再猜。
    嫂：不对？（唱）莫非是你哥哥打仗辛勤，送他些好吃的调剂精神？
    妹：也不对！部队上常常改善生活，不用你这么远捎吃的东西。
    嫂：这也不对噢？我想起来了！（唱）莫非是闹土改穷人翻身，捎去那土地证让他高兴？
    妹：咱家翻身分土地，哥哥早知道啦，送到前线干什么？不对，再猜。
    嫂：还是不对？哎呀，好难猜的东西呀！（唱）莫非是你哥哥杀敌立功，把那张大喜报叫他保存？
    妹：（笑）越发不对啦，哥哥的立功喜报，是给嫂嫂来报喜的，怎么还能再给哥哥捎回去呢？再猜吧！
    嫂：（不高兴）三猜四猜也猜不着，我不猜了！
    妹：我告诉你说吧，就是这件好东西，（指嫂心口）还没有把你的心装进袋子哩！
    嫂：（笑）你个调皮鬼！
    妹：不是我调皮，这叫做夫妻一条心。（嫂要打她，她马上又改了口气）不！这叫做前方后方一条心！
    （姑嫂紧接着唱第一曲）
    （一）前方打仗要英勇，（合）后方生产要加紧，（合）前后方，（妹）一条心，（嫂）心连心，（妹）不能分，（嫂）心心相连打敌人（合）。
    （二）人民的力量象铁锤，（合）反动派如今象鸡蛋，（合）蒋介石，（妹）快完蛋，（嫂）新中国，（妹）就实现，（嫂）大家迎接胜利年（合）。
    （三）村上开会来讨论，讨论怎样去劳军，（合）慰问袋，（妹）咱做成，（嫂）赶紧准备（妹）把礼送，（嫂）模范的军属不后人。（合）
  　　　　　　　　　（姑嫂在锣鼓声中急步下场）
