Editor's Note: It is absolutely necessary for Lu Pengying to receive Party disciplinary action. What actions will the government take regarding the mistakes he committed?

[Zhangjiakou Dispatch] Lu Pengying, the Director of the Industry and Commerce Bureau of Laishui-Zhuozhou County, lost his stance after being enticed and won over by speculative merchants upon entering the city, seriously violating policy. The County Committee has issued a warning to Lu. As the Director of the Industry and Commerce Bureau, Lu not only failed to correctly implement the industrial and commercial policy but was also misled by the hypocritical "respect" and "compliments" of some speculative merchants, believing the puppet merchants' association to be a "mass organization." He indulged unscrupulous merchants, led by Yan Ziming, the vice-chairman of the puppet merchants' association, in engaging in speculative trading, disrupting the market. Near the Lunar New Year, Yan Ziming and others attempted to raise prices and distort industrial and commercial policies, even posting slogans such as "Absolutely abolish publicly agreed prices" and "Oppose publicly agreed prices" in front of merchants' stores. Lu Pengying failed to strictly prohibit this behavior. After the county government discovered and investigated, Lu defended Yan and others, saying, "This is because our publicity and explanation work is not enough!" The merchants' association harbored materials from the puppet council, and Yan Ziming privately stored a sack of enemy "Customs Gold Units," "Gold Yuan Certificates," and "Legal Tender," failing to hand them over in violation of the law. After the government discovered this, Lu not only failed to enforce the law but even covered for him. During the busy period of supporting the front lines, the merchants' association perfunctorily performed their duties, drawing criticism from the government. Lu even personally told the county magistrate, "The merchants' association is a professional organization; we should not interfere with them to avoid affecting the development of industry and commerce!" At the same time, Lu casually and privately accepted items such as fountain pens purchased by the merchants' association. The Laishui-Zhuozhou County Committee and County Government repeatedly criticized him, asking him to examine his thinking and stance, but he not only refused to change but also resisted the leadership and refused to examine himself. Comrade Lu Pengying is a Communist Party member who has made many mistakes in the past, showing a severe lack of regard for organization and acting freely. He left his post without authorization twice to visit relatives, despite repeated education. This has had a very bad influence and caused undue losses to the Party and the people's cause. In order to strictly enforce Party discipline, educate all cadres and Party members, and correct Comrade Lu Pengying's mistakes, the County Committee, with the approval of the Prefectural Committee, has issued a warning to Lu Pengying and ordered him to continue reflecting on his actions.

　　涞涿县工商局长丧失立场
  　放纵奸商捣乱市场
    县委会予以警告处分
    编者按：卢鹏英受到党内处分是完全必要的。政府方面对其所犯的错误不知作何处理？
    【张垣电】涞涿县政府工商局长卢鹏英，入城后受投机商人诱惑拢络，失掉立场，严重的违犯政策，该县县委给卢以警告处分。卢身为工商局长，不仅不能正确执行工商业政策，而竟被一些投机商人的虚伪“奉敬”“恭维”所迷惑，便认为伪商会是“群众组织”，纵容了以伪商会副会长阎子明为首的一些奸商做投机买卖，扰乱市场。临近旧历年时，阎子明等企图抬高物价歪曲工商业政策，竟在商户门前贴出“绝对取缔公议价格”，“反对公议价格”等标语，卢鹏英对此行为竟不严加禁止。在县府发觉查明后，卢反为阎等辩护说：“这是我们宣传解释工作不够！”商会窝存伪参议会的物资，阎子明私存敌人“关金”、“金圆券”、“法币”一麻袋，违法不交，被政府查出后，卢不仅不执行反为其掩护。支援前线工作繁忙之际，商会对支援前线工作敷衍塞责，遭到政府批评，卢还亲自对县长说：“商会是职业团体，我们不应干涉他们，以免影响发展工商业！”同时卢随便私自受商会买的水笔等物。涞涿县委、县政府曾多次向他提出批评，要他好好检查思想、立场，他不仅不改，反和领导上对抗，拒绝检查。卢鹏英同志系共产党员，过去亦犯了不少错误，目无组织，自由行动很严重，下乡曾两次擅离职守串亲戚，数次教育不改，给党与人民事业以极坏影响与不应有的损失，县委为严整党纪，教育全体干部党员，纠正卢鹏英同志的错误，经地委批准给卢鹏英以警告处分，并让其继续反省。
