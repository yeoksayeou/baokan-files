　　Resolutely Rely on the Working Class
    With the great victory of the People's Liberation War, almost all the large and medium-sized cities in North China have been liberated. After entering the cities, who should we rely on? Without a doubt, we should rely on the urban working class. The Chinese working class is the leading class of the Chinese revolution, and the Chinese Communist Party is the vanguard of this class. Therefore, after entering the cities, we must put the work of the workers first and rely on the workers to do a good job in their work. Only in this way can we gain a firm foothold in the cities and give full play to the consciousness and initiative of the working class, so that they can fight for the interests of their class and the interests of their country.
    Judging from the experience of entering the cities over the past year or so, the work of the workers has generally not been given enough attention, and there are even extremely erroneous views. For example, for a considerable period after the liberation of Shijiazhuang, the work of the Party and the work of the workers failed to develop well. Many cadres only wanted to approach farmers and small businessmen, but were unwilling to approach workers, and were incompatible with the workers. This phenomenon was not seriously corrected until October of last year, and initial results have now been achieved. The situation in Yangquan City is also similar: many cadres are only willing to approach those with a strong peasant flavor, and workers engaged in simple labor, as well as non-production personnel, and are willing to develop Party members among them; while those old workers who have been working for many years, who are truly skilled and have a position, are considered to have "hooligan habits," complicated relationships, and an arrogant attitude, and are treated with indifference and alienation, so that non-production personnel account for an absolute majority of the Party members who have been developed, while workers account for only a very small number. For example, among the cadres and staff of the Fourth Mine, Party members account for 54 percent, while among the two thousand workers, there are only 48 Party members. There are many workers in the Jiaozuo Coal Mine, but since liberation, there have been no reports of any work being done for the workers. In the early days of the liberation of Weihui and Baoding, after the Military Control Commission entered the city, they convened meetings of teachers, students, and businessmen to publicize our Party's policies. This was entirely necessary, but no workers' meeting was convened, nor was any serious work done among the workers. In some places, after entering the city, the working class was only regarded as urban poor people, and measures were taken to resettle them with alms and relief, without regarding them as an advanced class.
    This phenomenon of neglect, indifference, and incompatibility with the workers is a right-leaning deviation, which is forgetting the basics. This erroneous deviation must be overcome.
    Why does this erroneous deviation occur? First, some Party members do not have a high level of class consciousness. Their motives for joining the Communist Party are extremely inconsistent. Some joined for the sake of resisting Japan, some for the sake of opposing Chiang Kai-shek, and some for the sake of dividing land. Their revolution takes one step at a time, and they lack a complete proletarian revolutionary view. Therefore, in the new situation of the victory of the Anti-Japanese War, the completion of land reform, and the collapse of Chiang Kai-shek, some comrades have developed vague ideas about the future of the revolution, and do not know what to do, how to do it, or who to rely on to do it. Holding this vague idea in entering the city, they will naturally not attach importance to the work of the workers, and will naturally have an attitude of indifference, neglect, and alienation towards the urban workers. This is a fundamental reason for neglecting the work of the workers.
    Second, since the Kuomintang reactionaries headed by Chiang Kai-shek betrayed the revolution in 1927, our Party was forced to move from the cities to the countryside. For more than 20 years, we have led the vast number of peasants and all other anti-imperialist and anti-feudal elements in the countryside, carried out the victorious land revolution, the Anti-Japanese War, and the People's Liberation War, and achieved great results, laying a solid foundation for the victory of the people's revolution throughout the country. However, due to living in the countryside for a long time, most of our Party's cadres have been geographically isolated from the urban workers. Most of the cadres who have risen up in the Party are of peasant origin, and still retain a lot of peasant consciousness, while some cadres of intellectual origin are also extremely unfamiliar with the workers due to working in the countryside for a long time, and lack or have no urban work experience at all. In addition, there is insufficient class education within the Party, so it is easy to develop a bias of incompatibility with the urban workers.
    In order to overcome this erroneous deviation, it is necessary to strengthen class education among cadres and Party members entering the cities, so that every Party member attaches importance to the work of the workers, closely relies on the urban workers, and uses all methods to organize and educate the urban workers. For their political obstruction and some bad habits caused by long-term deception and oppression by the Japanese and Chiang, they should be given patient education and helped to overcome them; their glorious deeds of heroic struggle should be encouraged and praised to raise their class consciousness; those few who follow the national enemies and class enemies should be exposed to the enemy's conspiracy and crimes, and systematic work should be carried out to win them over and transform them, sincerely helping them wash away the dirty things added to them by the enemy. This is the unshirkable responsibility of every Communist Party member to their own class masses. Putting on the airs of a victor in front of the workers and all working people is a fundamental mistake that must be thoroughly corrected.
    However, relying on the working class does not mean that the working class should fight alone; on the contrary, it means taking the working class as the leader and better uniting with other working people, intellectuals, and all anti-imperialist, anti-feudal, and anti-bureaucratic capitalist democrats to form a broad and strong people's democratic army, build people's cities, support the people's war, and strive for national victory.
    How to strengthen the work of the workers? First of all, we must list the work of the workers as the central task of the city, allocate sufficient and capable cadres, and go deep into factories and workers' residences to specialize in this work, contact workers, educate workers, and organize workers. The responsible comrades of the Municipal Party Committee and the Municipal Government should avoid all daily trivia, devote sufficient time to meet with the workers, understand the situation, solve problems, listen to the workers' opinions, and carry out various tasks. The Municipal Trade Union should be established in a timely manner to protect the legitimate rights of the workers, run the welfare undertakings of the workers, strengthen the political, cultural, and technical education of the workers, and help the workers form an organized revolutionary force, so as to consolidate the people's democratic dictatorship, in order to completely eliminate the Kuomintang reactionary forces and victoriously complete the new democratic revolution.

### 坚决依靠工人阶级

　　坚决依靠工人阶级
    随着人民解放战争伟大的胜利，华北大中城市几已全部解放。进入城市后，我们究竟应该依靠谁呢？毫无疑问的，应该依靠城市工人阶级。中国工人阶级，是中国革命的领导阶级，中国共产党，正是这个阶级的先锋队。因此，进入城市以后，就必须把工人工作放在第一位，依靠工人，做好工人工作。只有这样，我们才能在城市中站稳脚跟，才能发挥工人阶级的自觉性、积极性，使他们为自己阶级利益与自己国家的利益斗争。
    就一年多来进入城市的经验看来，对工人工作一般都是重视不够的，甚至存在着极端错误的观点。例如，石家庄解放后相当长的一个期间，党的工作与工人工作，未能很好开展，好些干部只愿接近农民、小商人，不愿接近工人，对工人格格不入。这种现象，直至去年十月才认真开始纠正，现已获得初步成绩。阳泉市的情形也相仿佛：好些干部，只愿意接近农民味道大的，和从事简单劳动的工人，以及非生产人员，愿意在他们中间去发展党员；而对长年劳动，真正有技术、有地位的老工人，则认为他们有“流氓习气”，关系复杂，态度骄傲，抱着冷淡疏远的态度，以致已发展的党员中，非生产人员占绝对多数，工人仅占极少数。如在四矿干勤人员中，党员即占百分之五十四，而在两千工人中，党员仅占四十八人。焦作煤矿工人很多，自解放至今，未见对工人工作有何报导。卫辉、保定解放初期，军管会进城后，均召开了教职员学生会议，商人会议，以宣传我党政策，这是完全需要的，但没有召开一次工人会议，也未见认真的在工人中进行若何工作。还有些地方进城之后，只把工人阶级，当着城市贫民一样看待，采取恩赐救济的办法去安置他们，没有把他们当着一个先进阶级来看待。
    这种对工人忽视、冷淡、与格格不入的现象，是一种右倾偏向，是忘了本。这种错误偏向必须加以克服。
    为什么会发生这种错误偏向呢？第一、有些党员阶级觉悟不高，他们加入共产党的动机是极不一致的，有的为了抗日，有的为了反蒋，有的为了平分土地，他们的革命是走了一步说一步，缺乏一个完整的无产阶级革命观。因此，处在抗日胜利、土改完成、蒋介石垮台的新形势下，有些同志对革命前途便发生了模糊思想，又不知该干什么，怎样干，依靠谁来干。抱着这种模糊的思想进城，自然不会重视工人工作，自然对城市工人会发生冷淡、忽视与疏远的态度，这是忽视工人工作的一个根本原因。
    第二、自从一九二七年蒋介石国民党反动派背叛革命之后，我党被迫地由城市转入乡村，二十余年来，在乡村领导了广大农民与其他一切反帝反封建分子，进行了胜利的土地革命，抗日战争，与人民解放战争，获得了伟大的成绩，奠定了人民革命在全国胜利的强固基础。但因长期生活在乡村，使我党大多数党员干部在地域上与城市工人隔离。党内后起的干部，大多数系农民出身，仍残留着不少的农民意识，而一部分知识分子出身的干部，也因长期在农村工作，对工人极其生疏，并缺乏或根本没有城市工作经验，加上党内阶级教育不足，因而对城市工人，就容易发生格格不入的偏向。
    为了克服这种错误偏向，就必须在进入城市的干部与党员中，加强阶级教育，使每个党员都重视工人工作，紧紧依靠城市工人，并用一切方法去组织与教育城市工人。对其长期在日蒋欺骗压榨下所造成的政治闭塞，与某些不良习气，要给以耐心教育，帮助其克服；对其英勇奋斗的光荣事迹，要给予鼓励和表扬，以提高其阶级觉悟；对其中少数跟着民族敌人与阶级敌人走的，要揭穿敌人的阴谋与罪恶，进行系统地争取改造工作，诚恳地帮助他们洗去敌人加给他们的污浊东西。这是每个共产党员，对自已阶级群众，义不容辞的责任。在工人及一切劳动人民面前摆胜利者的架子，就犯了原则错误，是必须加以彻底纠正的。
    但依靠工人阶级，绝不是要工人阶级孤军奋斗；相反地，是要以工人阶级作领导，更好的去团结其他劳动人民、与知识分子、以及一切反帝国主义、反封建主义、反官僚资本主义的民主人士，结成广大的坚强的人民民主大军，建设人民城市，支援人民战争，争取全国胜利。
    如何加强工人工作呢？首先必须把工人工作列为城市中心工作，分配足够的与得力的干部，深入工厂与工人住地专门进行这一工作，联系工人，教育工人，组织工人。市委与市政府的负责同志，应避开一切日常琐事，抽出充足的时间与工人见面，了解情况，解决问题，听取工人意见，开展各种工作。应适时的成立市工会，保护工人的正当权利，举办工人的福利事业，加强工人的政治、文化、技术的教育，帮助工人群众，形成一个有组织的革命力量，以此巩固人民民主专政，以便彻底消灭国民党反动势力，胜利地完成新民主主义革命。
