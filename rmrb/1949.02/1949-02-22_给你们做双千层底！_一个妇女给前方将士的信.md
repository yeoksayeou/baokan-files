　　I'll make you double-layered soles!
　　——A letter from a woman to the soldiers at the front
　　Dear soldiers at the front:
　　I heard that Tianjin and Beiping have been liberated again, and I am very happy. But I also know that the army is working hard at the front, fighting in the wind and snow every day to liberate the people of the whole country so that they can all have a good life.

　　But how should we women in the rear celebrate the victory at the front? How can we repay your hard work? I was thinking about this question when, by chance, the higher-ups sent down shoes. I thought, if you are fighting at the front, shouldn't we at home make you a good pair of shoes!

　t make you a good pair of shoes!
　　This time I will definitely make a good pair of shoes for you to wear. I am now taking out my favorite blue cloth to make double-layered soles, making them beautiful, strong and durable, so that you can wear them and win more battles.

　　Now our women and your family members are organized to spin, weave, and engage in production. Don't worry about your family. We will solve your family's difficulties for you. Don't worry, I am now rushing to make shoes for you. I will write here. I wish you good health forever and more victories!

　　给你们做双千层底！
    ——一个妇女给前方将士的信亲爱的前方将士们：
    我听说现在又解放了天津和北平，我很喜欢，可是我也知道军队在前方辛苦，每天在冒风冒雪打仗为了解放全国的老百姓，都过上好时光。
    可是俺们妇女在后方应该怎样来庆祝前方胜利？怎样来报答你们的辛苦，我正在想这个问题，可巧上级发下鞋来了，我想你们在前方打仗，难道俺们在家里还不给你们好好做双鞋吗！
    我这次总要做双好鞋送给你们穿，我现在拿出我爱见的青布来，做成千层底，做的好看，还要结实耐穿，叫你们穿上好好多打胜仗。
    现在俺们妇女们和你们家里的娘们组织起来，纺花织布闹生产，你们不要结记家里，你家的困难有我们给你们解决，你们放心吧，我现在紧着给你们做鞋，我就写在这里。祝你们身体永远健康，多打胜仗！
