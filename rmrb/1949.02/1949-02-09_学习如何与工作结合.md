Comrade ××:

You asked us to write about our learning experiences. I will briefly report to you as follows:

Our task in Shijiazhuang this time is mainly to understand market management issues and the living conditions of workers and urban laboring masses. Currently, we have only completed the investigation of the first issue, and the second issue has just begun. In the first half month of this period of study, we were able to maintain two hours of study in the morning, but we did not persist afterwards. Because we were investigating market management issues, and we were studying Chapter 4, Section 2 of the History of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union (Bolsheviks), on dialectical and historical materialism. Because we were laymen to the issue of market management, we investigated a lot of materials and our minds were filled, but we couldn't digest them. How to understand these issues and further analyze and study them was our most pressing need at the time. Therefore, during study time, it was difficult for us to temporarily put aside these problems that needed to be solved but could not be solved through investigation. On the contrary, we hoped to browse through books and open our minds during study time. So, naturally, we stopped studying Chapter 4, Section 2 of the History of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union (Bolsheviks), and replaced it with articles such as Lenin's Selected Works, Volume 16, Part 2, New Economic Policy, and On the Food Tax in the 1921 period. In this way, we felt much lighter, and being busy with work no longer affected study, and study was no longer an extra burden on work; because study could directly help work, and study was exactly what work needed, the two became one thing as soon as they entered the mind. However, our study of Chapter 4, Section 2 of the History of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union (Bolsheviks) did not proceed according to the study plan, which should always be considered a shortcoming.

Our study of articles such as On the Food Tax was not a conscious, systematic, and planned serious study as a method of combining study with work.

But because we did combine study and work after all, we ourselves did feel that we gained some benefits. We felt enlightened after reading several articles on the food tax. Although we still learned it in a superficial and half-understood way, it did help our work a lot. Because when we were reading, we always had a purpose, to find out what the book said, and the purpose was very clear. Therefore, even if the overall understanding of a certain article was not enough, we grasped the problem we wanted to find, whether it was a paragraph or a sentence, and used it to help study the problems in our work, thus gaining enlightenment. It would never be like reading normally, not seeking thorough understanding and skimming through it. We see that combining study and work can overcome empiricism and help empiricists acquire methods of learning, and overcome their excuses for not wanting to study. At the same time, it can also prevent dogmatism, because this method of learning is consistent in learning and application, not starting from books, but starting from work. This method of learning itself is a method of linking theory with practice.

"Starting from reality" is a cliché that everyone loves to say. Many people take it as a weapon, saying, "That's enough, why study theory?" In the past, we thought it was wrong not to study theory, but if we were busy with work or didn't have the conditions to study theory, having the principle of starting from reality would prevent us from making any mistakes. After this period of working and studying at the same time, we believe that this is completely wrong. Because starting from reality requires first clarifying reality. If reality is not clarified or is misunderstood, the starting point will lead to the wrong path. To understand reality, we must improve our ability to analyze and synthesize things through learning theory. When investigating market management in Shijiazhuang, we initially heard some comrades say: "The market problem is not big anymore, and the grain price has been suppressed recently." "There is no speculation in the grain industry!" "There are no big private capitalists in Shijiazhuang, and they can't cause much trouble," etc. Because we often read books, we felt that this statement was not quite right. We didn't understand the actual situation yet, and others also said that we didn't understand the actual situation, but starting from the books alone, we were skeptical. Because Lenin clearly stated in On the Food Tax: In a small-peasant country, the spontaneous forces of the petty bourgeoisie dominate, and the widespread petty bourgeoisie and private capitalist economy are the economic basis for speculation. Speculators sabotage the national economy here and there, and the main object of speculation is grain (roughly). Later, due to the soaring grain prices, the Economic Commission discussed it many times, and the view changed. We only had an abstract understanding of a few words in the book, which helped us understand the real situation. If the comrades responsible for leading and managing the market department combined their work with good theoretical study, the benefits for improving their work would be even greater. Because they did not clarify the actual situation and neglected the power of private capitalism and its illegal speculative activities, they simply adopted the method of suppressing prices by selling grain at low prices in their price policy, without knowing how to lead, manage, and control private commercial capital. As a result, most of the grain sold by the trading company was sold to speculators, which benefited the merchants who took the opportunity to profit. The state-owned trading company consumed a lot of its own strength, but the grain price was not lowered, but instead rose higher.

The study of cadres in Shijiazhuang has begun in accordance with the instructions of the North China Bureau on the study of on-the-job cadres. It is being carried out relatively seriously and intensively. The two-hour study system in each agency has been generally implemented, but there is not much business study (theoretical, policy, and technical) related to work. The Municipal Party Committee printed some articles on the food tax and distributed them to various economic departments, but most of them did not study them well. On the one hand, it did not attract attention, and on the other hand, it may be that they were very busy with work, and there was also general cultural and theoretical study, so time became a problem. We are relatively unfamiliar with the city, industry, and commerce. Most of the cadres come from the countryside, and most of them are peasant cadres. Today, to manage the city, industry, and commerce, we must study well. In addition to the policy instructions from the higher authorities, what else should we study, how should it be combined with work, and how should it be combined with general cultural and theoretical study? We feel that this is a problem. We did not combine it well and relaxed the study stipulated by the Study Committee.

I have said these things very hastily. Some of the views may be wrong. Please give instructions.

### 学习如何与工作结合

　　学习如何与工作结合
    李仪同志的这封信，对学习与工作结合的问题，提供了好的意见，特发表以供大家参考。　　　　　　　
　　——编者××同志：
    你要我们写一写学习心得，我就简单向你报告如下：
    此次我们到石家庄的任务，主要是了解市场管理问题和工人，城市劳动群众的生活状况。现在我们只完成了第一个问题的调查，第二个问题刚开始调查。在这一段时期中的学习，开始半个月中，早晨两小时的学习，还能保持，以后就没有坚持下去了。因为我们调查的是市场管理问题，而学习的是联共党史第四章第二节，论辩证唯物主义与历史唯物主义，因为我们对市场管理问题是门外汉，调查许多材料，脑子里装满了，但是消化不了。怎样弄懂这些问题，和进一步分析研究，是我们当时最迫切的要求。所以在学习时候，我们很难把这些调查来需要解决而解决不了的问题，暂时放在一旁，而相反的，则是希望能在学习时间，翻翻书本子，开开窍，所以自然而然的，把联共党史四章二节的学习停止了，而代之以列宁选集十六集第二编新经济政策、一九二一年时期的论粮食税等文章。这样一来，我们轻快得多了，工作忙也不再影响学习，而学习也不再成为工作的额外负担了；因为学习可以直接的帮助工作，而学习正是工作所需要，两者一进入脑子里，就成了一个东西。不过我们对联共党史四章二节的学习，没有按学习计划进行，始终应该算是一个缺点。
    我们学习论粮食税等文章，也不是自觉的，有系统有计划的作为一种学习方法（与工作结合）去认真学习。
    但因为到底把学习和工作结合起来了，我们自己确也感到获得一些益处。我们读论粮食税几篇文章，觉得很开窍。虽然学的还是囫囵吞枣，一知半解，但是对我们的工作却是有不少帮助。因为在我们阅读的时候，总是有一个目的，要找找书本上是怎么说，目的性非常明确。所以哪怕对某一篇文章全面地理解很不够，但找到了所要找的问题，一段话也好，一个句子也好，就抓紧它了，用来帮助研究工作上的问题，从而得到启示。绝不会象平常读书那样，不求甚解，一滑即过了。我们看把学习与工作结合起来，可以克服经验主义并帮助经验主义者获得学习的方法，克服其不愿学习的借口。同时也可以防止了教条主义，因为这种学习方法是学用一致的，不是从书本出发，而是从工作出发，这种学习方法的本身就是理论与实际联系的方法。
    “从实际出发”，这是人人爱说的一句口头禅，不少人拿它当武器，说：“这就够了，还学习什么理论？”我们过去认为不学习理论是不对的，但如果工作忙，或者没有学习理论的条件，有了从实际出发这一条，也就不会出什么错了。经过这一段一边工作一边学习以后，我们认为这是完全错误的。因为从实际出发，必须先弄清实际，实际弄不清或弄错了，出发就会出到错路上去。认识现实，就必须从学习理论中提高对事物分析、综合的能力，在石庄调查市场管理时，开始我们听到有些同志是这样说：“市场问题不大了，最近粮价已压下去了。”“粮食行里，没有什么投机的！”“石家庄私人资本家没有什么大的，捣鬼也捣不大”等等。因为我们常常翻书本子，觉得这样说法不大对头，我们对实际情况还不了解，而别人也说我们不了解实际情况，但单从书本出发，我们即抱怀疑态度，因为列宁在论粮食税里很清楚的说：一个小农国家里，小资产阶级自发势力占优势，广泛的小资产阶级和私人经营的资本主义，是投机事业的经济基础。投机家时而在这里，时而在那里破坏国家经济，而投机的主要对象是粮食（大意如此）。后来因粮价暴涨，经济委员会多次讨论，看法就改变过来了。我们只是抽象的了解书本上几句话，就对我们认识现实情况有帮助。如果负责领导和管理市场部门的同志，结合工作很好学习理论，对改进工作益处一定更大。因为他们把实际情况没弄清楚，忽视私人资本主义的力量和其非法的投机活动，所以在物价政策上，单纯采用低价抛售粮食的压价办法，而不知对私人商业资本实行领导、管理和控制，结果贸易公司抛出的粮食，大部抛到投机商人的手里，正利于商人们投我们之机而赚大钱。国营贸易公司大量消耗了自己的力量，粮价不见压低，反见更高。
    石庄干部学习，已按照华北局在职干部学习的指示开始了，进行得还比较认真、紧张，各机关两小时学习制都已普遍执行，但与工作有关的业务学习（理论的、政策的、技术的）则见的不多。市委曾印了一些论粮食税发给各经济部门，但大都没很好学习。一方面没引起注意，一方面也可能是工作很忙，又有一般的文化和理论的学习，时间成问题。城市，工商业，对我们是比较生疏的，干部多是从农村中来而大部分又是农民干部，今天要管理城市和工商业，就须很好学习。除了上级的政策指示以外，还应当学习些什么，与工作怎样结合，与一般文化及理论学习又怎样结合，我们感到是一个问题。我们就没结合好，把学委会规定的学习放松了。
    很草率的讲了这些，有些看法可能是错误的，请指示。
