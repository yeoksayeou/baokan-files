(Taiyue Telegram) At the county-wide production conference in Gao Ping last December, it was decided to adopt a policy of "public operation with government assistance" to support and organize blacksmiths and carpenters to manufacture and repair agricultural tools in large quantities. According to recent statistics, there are already 78 blacksmith shops in the county, actively stepping up repairs and manufacturing. In the Fifth District, there are 44 blacksmith shops, 14 of which mainly make cart wheels. For example, the blacksmith Zhan Gehai cooperative in Dongzhuang, Fourth District, was given iron as capital, and has now repaired 80 hoes and bracelets. Yang Lühai's carpentry shop in Qinjiazhuang lacked capital, so the bank loaned him 320 catties of wheat and helped him draw up a plan: by February, he would guarantee to produce 15 manure buckets, 5 water buckets, 8 rakes, 80 carrying poles, and 50 hoe handles to meet the needs of the village. He has already made 35 hoe handles and 53 carrying poles. However, there are still two problems that urgently need to be solved in the manufacture and repair of agricultural tools in various places: First, many blacksmiths and carpenters are afraid to take on apprentices, which affects the improvement of productivity and prevents the training of more talents. This is caused by the master-apprentice relationship and egalitarianism in wages. For example, Zhang Changhe in Zhangbi Village, Fifth District, took an apprentice to work in another village, and the wages were calculated for three people. The apprentice also wanted to get one person's share. If he was given less, he would say it was "exploitation." Second, because of the masses' habit of thinking that "it's better to spend money than to have half a year of idleness," some people are unwilling to prepare early. For example, when Comrade Yang Bingsen, a cadre in the Fifth District, mobilized the masses to invest in plows, the masses said: "The plows invested now cannot be tried out in the fields immediately, and we are afraid that they will not be useful next year and will be a waste of money." Therefore, it is necessary to conduct in-depth investigations, propose the agricultural tools that should be repaired and manufactured according to the different needs of the masses, and persuade the masses to prepare agricultural tools early based on their own experiences.

　　组织铁木工匠中应注意改善师徒关系
    【太岳电】高平在去年十二月全县生产会议上，决定采取民办公助的方针，扶植与组织铁木工匠大量修制农具。据最近统计，全县已有铁匠炉七十八个，积极在加紧修造。五区有四十四个铁匠炉，共中有十四个主要是打车轮。又如四区董庄铁匠斩圪孩合作社借给他铁做资本，现已修理好锄、镯八十件。秦家庄杨驴孩的木铺，资本不足，银行贷给他三百二十斤麦子，又帮助他订了计划：到二月里，保证要做出粪桶十五付、水桶五付、耙八张、扁担八十根、锄柄五十根，供给本村需用，现已作成锄柄三十五根、扁担五十三根。但目前各地修制农具中，还有两个问题急须解决：一、不少铁木工人，怕带学徒，影响生产力提高，不能培养出更多人材，这是因为师徒关系和工资上的平均主义所造成的。如五区张壁村张长河带有一个学徒，到外村做活，算回三个人的工资，徒弟也要得一个人的，给他少些，就说是“剥削”。二、因为在群众习惯上，认为“有钱不置半年闲”，所以有些人还不愿作及早准备。如五区干部杨并森同志动员群众投犁时，群众说：“现在投下的犁，马上不能在地里试用，怕明年不顶用白花了钱。”因此必须深入调查，根据群众不同的需要提出应修制的农具，并从他们的切身经验中，说服群众提早准备农具。
