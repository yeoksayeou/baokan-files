　　The Sun Shines Into Everyone's Home
    Li Zhongzhen, a female worker from Yangquan Textile Factory
     The big willow tree, in bloom,
     The sun shines into everyone's home,
     Chairman Mao is the red sun,
     Shining especially bright in the homes of workers.
     Coal and iron, heavy and dense,
     Yan Xishan used them to crush people to death.
     The Communist Party, the Liberation Army,
     Led everyone to turn themselves over.
     Iron is still heavy, coal is still dense,
     Dad always says he saves strength.
     I asked Dad why?
     Dad said:
     "You go up the mountain, I dig coal,
     Your mother cooks at home,
     We have food and clothing and peace of mind,
     Working doesn't feel tiring."
     A catty is sixteen taels,
     My heart will never forget the Communist Party.
     Sixteen taels make a catty,
     Having food and clothing, we won't forget the Liberation Army.
             (Note: "沉又沉" means heavy.)

　　太阳照进众人家
    阳泉纺纱厂女工李忠贞
     大柳树，开了花，
     太阳照进众人家，
     毛主席就是红太阳，
     照得工人家里特别亮。
     煤和铁，沉又沉，
     阎锡山在它压死人。
     共产党，解放军
     领导众人翻了身。
     铁还重、煤还沉，
     爸爸总说省了劲。
     我问爸爸为什么？
     爸爸说：
     “你上山，我刨炭，
     你妈在家做熟饭，
     有吃有穿省了心，
     干活就觉不费劲。”
     称一斤是十六两，
     我心忘不了共产党。
     十六两是一斤，
     有吃有穿不忘解放军。
             （注：沉又沉是重的意思。）
