The purpose of the conference was to unite the youth of Southeast Asian countries in their struggle against imperialist oppression, to strive for the freedom and independence of their motherlands, and to expand the ties between the youth of Southeast Asian countries and the youth of the world.
　　Uzbek Soviet Socialist Republic – One of the sixteen republics of the Soviet Union, it joined the Soviet Union in 1924. Located in the southern part of Soviet Central Asia, it covers an area of approximately 300,000 square kilometers and has a population of 6.3 million, including the Kara-Kalpak Autonomous Republic. Cotton is its most famous product, and the production of steel, other chemicals, and petroleum is also increasing year by year. Uzbek territory is home to Tajiks, Russians, and Jews, who are united and have no barriers between them.
　　Tsar – In the fifteenth century, Ivan III Vasilyevich, the Grand Duke of Moscow, first proclaimed himself "Tsar of Russia" when he organized the Russian state. In Russian, the pronunciation of "Tsar" is "Tsar," and Tsar refers to the Russian Emperor. "The Tsarist Era" refers to the era when the Tsars were in power before the revolution.
　　Transjordan – A small country in the Near East, enslaved by British imperialism, located in the eastern part of Palestine, bordered by the Jordan River and Palestine. It has an area of only 34,740 square miles and a population of about 400,000, mostly Arabs and Jews. The king is called Abdullah and the capital is Amman. After the First World War, Transjordan was ruled by British imperialism. After the Second World War, on March 22, 1946, British imperialism signed a treaty of alliance with Transjordan under the guise of recognizing Transjordan's independence, thereby providing Transjordan with military armament and financial assistance and supplying officers. British imperialism also obtained the right to continue stationing troops. Thus, although British imperialism recognized Transjordan's "independence," Transjordan was in fact still ruled by British imperialism. Moreover, in 1946, British imperialism stepped up the construction of military bases in Transjordan, especially in the south. The land in Transjordan is extremely barren and mostly desert, and the residents are mainly engaged in animal husbandry, with very few agricultural products.

    乌兹贝克共和国——是苏联的十六个加盟共和国的一个，于一九二四年加入苏联。在苏联中央亚细亚的南部，面积约三十多万方公里，人口六百三十万，其中还包括卡拉·卡尔巴克自治共和国。出产中以棉花为最著名，钢、其他化学品以及石油的产量也在逐年增加中。乌兹贝克境内有达辑克人、俄罗斯人及犹太人，他们团结在一起，毫无隔阂。
    沙皇——在十五世纪，莫斯科公国的大公伊凡三世·华西里维奇，在他进行组织俄罗斯国家时，首先自称为“俄皇”，俄文中“俄皇”音读是“沙尔”，沙皇也就是指的俄国皇帝，“沙皇时代”是指革命前的俄皇当权的时代。
    外约旦——是近东里的一个小国家，受英帝国主义的奴役，位于巴勒斯坦的东部，以约旦河和巴勒斯坦为界，面积仅有三万四千七百四十方哩，人口约有四十多万，以阿剌伯、犹太人占大多数，国王叫做阿不拉杜、首都在阿满。外约旦在第一次世界大战后，就被英帝国主义所统治，至第二次世界大战以后，于一九四六年三月二十二日，英帝国主义假与外约旦签定同盟条约承认外约旦独立为名，因而对外约旦进行作战武装和财政上的帮助，和供应军官，英帝国主义复获得有继续驻军的权利。由此看来英帝国主义虽然承认外约旦的“独立”，事实上外约旦仍然受着英帝国主义所统治。而且在一九四六年，英帝国主义就在外约旦国内加紧建设军事基地，尤以南部为最。外约旦国内的土地，极其荒凉，且多沙漠地带，居民多以牧畜业为主，农产品甚少。
