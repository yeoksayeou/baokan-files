Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, February 25th: According to a broadcast from the Free Greece Radio Station, on the 17th of this month, the Greek Democratic Army shot down an enemy plane bombing peaceful residents near the village of Bisodra, near Florina in Western Macedonia. All personnel on board were killed. The pilot of the plane was American Air Force Captain Wagner, and the co-pilot was British Air Force Lieutenant Colonel William Hood. Hood was a member of the so-called United Nations Balkan Committee Observation Group stationed in Salonika. This not only proves once again that the American and British imperialists are directly participating in the civil war to slaughter the Greek people, but also shows what the so-called United Nations Balkan Committee really is.

Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, February 25th: Free Greece Radio broadcast that the "mopping-up operation" launched by the Royalist Fascist army in the Peloponnese Peninsula in southern Greece two months ago has failed. The Royalist Fascist army did not achieve any strategic goals in the Peloponnese Peninsula, and the Democratic Army's Third Division still controls the mountains in the central part of the peninsula. In other areas of the Peloponnese, the Democratic Army continues to operate as before, constantly attacking the enemy.

On the Vitsi front in the Kastoria region of Western Macedonia, Democratic Army infantry, under the cover of mortars and artillery, attacked Royalist Fascist troops on the march on the 14th. 135 enemy soldiers were killed or wounded. The Democratic Army operating in Kaponisi, west of Athens, cleared several enemy high points on the 13th, killing or wounding more than 130 enemies. The Democratic Army is also very active near the cities of Larissa and Karditsa in the Thessaly plain.

The detailed results of the Democratic Army's attack on Florina, an important town in Western Macedonia, on the night of the 12th are as follows: 404 enemy soldiers were killed, 976 were wounded, and 82 were captured. A total of 1,462 enemies were wiped out in one night. One enemy plane was shot down, 15 trucks were burned, and 2 armored vehicles were destroyed. Twelve warehouses storing gasoline, ammunition, and food, six radio stations, five heavy mortars, twelve mortars, six heavy machine guns, twenty-two light machine guns, and a large number of rifles, Thompson submachine guns, and other spoils were captured.

    【新华社陕北二十五日电】据自由希腊电台广播：本月十七日，希腊民主军在西马其顿佛罗里那附近的比索德拉村，击落轰炸和平居民的敌机一架，机中的全体人员均已毙命。该机的驾驶员是美国空军上尉瓦格诺尔及英国空军中校威廉·胡德。胡德是驻在萨罗尼加的所谓联合国巴尔干委员会观察组的组员。这不仅再一次证明了美英帝国主义者直接参加屠杀希腊人民的内战，同时也说明了所谓联合国巴尔干委员会究竟是个什么东西。

    在西马其顿卡斯托利亚地区的维齐前线，民主军步兵于十四日在迫击炮与大炮掩护下进攻正在行军的保皇法西斯部队。毙伤敌军一百三十五人。在雅典西卡彭尼西作战的民主军，于十三日扫清敌人的制高点数处，毙伤敌人一百三十余人。民主军在色萨利平原的拉利萨和卡迪柴两城附近也十分活跃。
    民主军所部十二日夜攻入西马其顿重镇佛罗里那的详细战果如下：毙敌四○四人，伤敌九七六人，俘敌八二人。一夜之间共歼敌一四六二人。击落敌机一架、烧毁卡车十五辆、装甲车二辆。缴获储藏汽油、弹药及粮食的仓库十二座、无线电台六部、重迫击炮五门、迫击炮十二门、重机枪六挺、轻机枪二十二挺及大量步枪、汤姆枪与其他战利品。
