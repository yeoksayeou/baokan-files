Common Industrial Poisonings and Prevention

　　In industry, various raw materials, semi-finished and finished products, waste materials, or gases, vapors, and dust generated during work can have chemical effects on people and harm their health. Here are some points for relevant parties to consider.

　　I. Lead Poisoning
　　Mainly caused by inhaling airborne lead compound dust, it is a chronic poisoning. Lead-contaminated fingers can also be absorbed through the mouth through other means. This disease is common among workers in lead factories, printing, and typesetting workers.
　　It starts with loss of appetite, a feeling of pressure or fullness in the stomach, headache, and joint pain. This is followed by persistent constipation, anemia, pallor, lead lines on the gums, wrist paralysis, and motor paralysis of the finger extensors. Pregnant women who contract lead poisoning are prone to miscarriage.
　　Treatment involves taking "Epsom salt" to promote the excretion of lead toxins. Calcium chloride injections can be used for joint paralysis, followed by massage for prevention. The workplace should have good ventilation, and workers should wear masks and gloves, and wash their hands before meals.

　　II. Chronic Yellow Phosphorus Poisoning
　　This disease is mostly found in yellow phosphorus match factories. Due to the inhalation of yellow phosphorus vapor, especially people with decayed teeth are prone to this condition. Yellow phosphorus vapor enters through decayed teeth or alveolar protrusions, making the jawbone, especially the lower jawbone, prone to periostitis or necrosis.
　　Treatment involves stopping work and consulting a dentist. Prevention involves wearing a mask and paying attention to workplace ventilation.

　　III. Chronic "Nicotine" Poisoning in the Tobacco Industry
　　The tobacco industry employs mostly female workers. It is caused by inhaling tobacco dust or the fine fluff from leaf veins. Symptoms include nausea, headache, gastrointestinal disorders, heart disorders (irregular pulse, palpitations), visual and auditory impairment, and reproductive organ disorders.
　　Prevention methods include wearing masks, washing the face, and showering.

　　IV. Electric Ophthalmia
　　Welding and cutting workers in iron factories, etc., experience eye pain, tearing, photophobia, burning, and decreased vision a few hours after exposure to ultraviolet rays and strong light during welding. Conjunctivitis is generally likely to occur.
　　Prevention involves wearing protective eyewear.

　　V. Coal Mine Hygiene
　　Miners working in coal mines are prone to pneumoconiosis due to inhaling stone dust and coal dust when excavating rock layers outside the coal seam. Good ventilation inside the mine can reduce coal dust, and cold air can be introduced when necessary. Perfecting drainage within the mine and preventing dampness can prevent the spread of coal dust.
　　Poor lighting inside the mine can easily lead to nystagmus. Lighting inside the mine should be improved, or electric lights should be used.
　　When the temperature and humidity are high inside the mine, hookworm eggs easily hatch and larvae survive. Miners can become infected inside the mine and develop anemia. Therefore, efforts should be made to eradicate them, and miners with hookworm disease should be prohibited from working in the mine. Those who are ill must undergo deworming treatment. Improve mine latrines; more safe and clean mine latrines should be provided. In mines where parasites already exist, saltwater should be sprinkled to kill the eggs, swept away, and shoes should be improved. Work in the mine wearing shoes.

　　工业中常见的几种中毒和预防
    在工业中种种的原料，半成品和成品，废弃物，或在工作中产生的瓦斯、蒸气、尘埃等，对于人起化学的作用，而有害健康。于此，提出下列几点，供有关各方面参考。
　　一、铅中毒
    主要是由于吸入飞散的铅化合物粉尘而起的慢性中毒，被铅污染的手指藉其他关系也可由嘴吸收而造成此病。铅工厂工人、印刷、排字工人常见此病。
    开始是食欲减退，胃部有压迫或饱满感，头重，关节痛。其次是发生顽固的大便秘结，贫血，脸色苍白，齿龈带铅缘，腕麻痹，手指伸肌发生运动麻痹，妊妇得铅中毒时容易流产。
    治法是服用“泻利盐”促进排泄铅毒。关节麻痹等注射氯化钙，再实行按摩预防方法。工作场换气要好，工人戴口罩、手套，饭前洗手。
　　二、慢性黄磷中毒
    多在黄磷火柴工厂发现此病。由于吸入黄磷蒸气，特别是有虫牙的人容易发生，黄磷蒸气由虫牙或齿槽突起侵入，使颚骨特别是下颚骨容易发生骨膜炎或坏死。
    治疗是停止工作，请齿科医生治疗。预防法要戴口罩，注意工作场换气。
　　三、烟卷业慢性“尼古丁”中毒
    烟卷业多为妇女工作者，由于吸入烟料尘埃或叶脉的小毛粉尘而起。呕心、头痛、胃肠障害、心脏障害（脉不整、心跳）。视力及听力障害、生殖器障害。
    预防方法是戴口罩、洗脸、洗澡。
　　四、电光性眼炎
    铁工厂等熔接、熔断工人，在熔接时由于紫外线及强光线，如果照射眼睛后数小时即引起眼睛的疼痛，流泪羞明、灼热、视力减退，一般容易发生结膜炎。
    预防，戴护眼眼镜。
　　五、煤矿卫生
    在煤矿坑内工作的矿工，由于掘凿煤层外的岩层，吸入石粉及煤粉，易发生尘肺。坑内的通气良好即可减小煤粉，必要时可送入冷风。坑内排水应当完善、防止坑内湿润，可防煤粉的发散。
    坑内照明不好，易得眼球震荡症，应改善坑内照明，或使用电灯。
    在坑内气温高而湿润时，十二指肠虫卵容易孵化及幼虫生存，矿工在坑内感染而发生贫血。所以应当讲求扑灭办法，禁止得十二指肠病矿工入坑工作。得病的必须实行驱虫疗法。改良坑内便所，应多设安全且清洁的坑内便所，已经有寄生虫的坑内，要撒食盐水杀灭虫卵，清扫出去，改善鞋，穿鞋入坑工作。
