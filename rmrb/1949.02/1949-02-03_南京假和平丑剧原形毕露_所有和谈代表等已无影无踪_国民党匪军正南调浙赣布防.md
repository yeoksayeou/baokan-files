Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 1st. The sham peace farce in Nanjing, only a week after Chiang Kai-shek's "resignation" on the 21st of last month, has collapsed and its true form has been exposed. Apart from the pseudo-President Li Zongren still guarding the empty stage in Nanjing, all the peace talk representatives and all the pseudo-government ministers have vanished, leaving only preparations for war. A large number of Kuomintang bandit troops are withdrawing from north of the Yangtze River to deploy defenses south of the Yangtze, and are also withdrawing south from the Nanjing-Shanghai and Shanghai-Hangzhou lines, transferring to Zhejiang and Jiangxi for defense. Shanghai and Pudong are crowded with bandit troops, forcibly occupying civilian houses and rapidly building fortifications. The railway lines are in "complete chaos," with all trains occupied by troops and officials coming from Nanjing, and passenger trains completely suspended for several days. On the 29th, all trains were delayed, some by as much as twenty hours. Train accidents occur daily, with several people being killed or injured every day. A French news agency reporter wrote: "The withdrawal of a large number of Kuomintang troops from the Nanjing area is not considered a gesture of peace, but rather an attempt by the government to establish a resistance stronghold in some parts of South China." While Li Zongren demanded "rapid peace talks," Zhang Zhizhong, the peace talk representative designated by Li Zongren, arrived in Hankou on the 28th and discussed matters with Bai Chongxi. On the 30th, he flew from Hankou to Xi'an, and it is said that he will also go to Gansu and Xinjiang. Another designated peace talk representative, Peng Zhaoxian, resigned after being rejected by the Chinese Communist Party, but was retained by the pseudo-Executive Yuan, and it is now unclear whether he is still considered a representative. Even Li Zongren himself is rumored to be preparing to flee to Guangzhou. The pseudo-Executive Yuan's President and Vice President, Sun Ke and Wu Tiecheng, have both "disappeared." A foreign reporter in Shanghai searched for Sun Ke for thirty hours, using phone calls, errands, and cars, but could not find him. It is said that he has gone to Fenghua to see Chiang Kai-shek, and then will transfer to the new counter-revolutionary center of Guangzhou. War criminals Chen Lifu, Gu Zhenggang, He Yingqin, Zhang Qun, Peng Zhaoxian, Guan Jiyu, and others left even earlier than Sun Ke and Wu Tiecheng. "Almost all ministers are believed to have left Nanjing." "Although Chiang Kai-shek has retired to Fenghua, he is in fact continuing to lead the Kuomintang's tricks. According to reliable sources, the telephone and radio between Fenghua and Nanjing are very busy. Acting President Li Zongren is extending his tentacles according to Chiang Kai-shek's orders. Any promises he makes to the enemy (referring to the Chinese Communist Party) will be worthless." (Agence France-Presse) Shanghai News: According to Chiang Kai-shek's order, the Kuomintang Central Propaganda Department issued a "Special Urgent Propaganda Circular" on the 24th. It stated: "Although the President is temporarily not exercising presidential powers, he will continue to lead the party in its revolutionary efforts as President. Party comrades must sincerely accept the President's instructions." It also stated: Regarding the peace issue, we must "study the President's New Year's Day message and the January 21st statement as the basis for our discourse." People believe that, despite the Nanjing Kuomintang government expressing itself in such a contradictory, farcical, hypocritical, and chaotic manner, the Chinese Communist Party and the Chinese democratic parties, people's organizations, cannot let them simply say what they want. All serious democratic forces must insist on negotiating a final outcome with the Nanjing government, so as to truly realize national peace in accordance with the eight peace terms.

　　南京假和平丑剧原形毕露
    所有和谈代表等已无影无踪
  　国民党匪军正南调浙赣布防
    【新华社陕北一日电】南京的假和平丑剧，从上月二十一日蒋介石“离职”，只过了一个星期，就土崩瓦解，原形毕露。除了伪代总统李宗仁还守着南京的空虚的舞台以外，所有的和谈代表以及所有的伪政府部长都已经无影无踪，剩下的就只有战争的准备。大批的国民党匪军一方面由江北撤往江南布防，一方面由京沪路和沪杭路南撤，转往浙江、江西布防。上海和浦东都挤满了匪军，强占民房，并迅速构筑工事。铁路线是“全然的混乱”，火车全被南京下来的军队和官员占据，有几天客车完全停止。二十九日一切火车均告误点，若干火车误点二十小时之久。火车出事事件，日必发生，每日都要死伤数人。法新社的记者写道：“大批国民党军队自南京地区撤退，被认为不是和平姿态，而是政府企图在华南某些地方建立抵抗的据点。”与李宗仁要求“迅速和谈”同时，李宗仁所指定的和谈代表张治中二十八日到了汉口，和白崇禧有所商谈，三十日又由汉口飞到西安，据说他还要去甘肃和新疆。另一个被指定的和谈代表彭昭贤，因受中共拒绝而提出辞职，又被伪行政院挽留，现在连究竟还算不算一个代表，也没有下文。甚至李宗仁自己也有准备逃往广州的传说。伪行政院正副院长孙科和吴铁城则同告“失踪”。一个外国记者在上海找孙科，用打电话、跑腿和乘汽车，找寻了三十个小时，始终没有找到。据说，他已往奉化见蒋介石，然后转往新的反革命中心广州。战犯陈立夫、谷正纲、何应钦、张群、彭昭贤、关吉玉等比孙科、吴铁城等走得还要早。“几乎一切部长均被认为已离开南京。”“蒋介石尽管已引退到奉化，事实上仍在继续领导国民党的把戏。据可靠消息，奉化与南京之间的电话与无线电很忙碌。代总统李宗仁依照蒋介石的命令而伸出触角。他向敌方（指中共方面）所做的任何诺言将没有任何价值。”（法新社）上海消息：根据蒋介石的命令，国民党中央宣传部于二十四日发出“特别紧急宣传通报”一件。其中说：“总裁虽暂不行使总统职权，但仍以总裁地位继续领导本党致力革命。本党同志更须共同精诚接受总统之指示。”又说：关于和平问题必须“研究总裁元旦文告及一月二十一日声明，以为言论之基准。”人们相信：尽管南京国民党政府表示得如此矛盾，如此儿戏，如此虚伪，如此混乱，中国共产党和中国各民主党派、人民团体，却不能让他们随便说了就算。一切郑重的民主力量，一定要坚持和南京政府谈判出一个究竟，以便按照八项和平条件，确实地实现全国的和平。
