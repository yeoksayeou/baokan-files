Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 2nd: Fifty-six representatives of democratic parties and people's organizations and other democratic figures, including Li Jishen, Shen Junru, Ma Xulun, and Guo Moruo, who have arrived in the Chinese People's Liberation Areas, sent a telegram on the first of this month to Chairman Mao Zedong of the Chinese Communist Party and Commander-in-Chief Zhu De of the Chinese People's Liberation Army, celebrating the great victory of the People's Liberation War. The telegram reads as follows:

To Chairman Mao Zedong of the Chinese Communist Party, Commander-in-Chief Zhu De of the Chinese People's Liberation Army, and all Comrades-in-Arms:

Our People's Liberation Army is the people's armed force and the vanguard of the revolution. It has been fighting for two and a half years. You, esteemed sirs, have commanded with composure, and your contributions have been great. The soldiers have been dutiful and devoted. Wherever the banners point, people bring food and drink to welcome them. The attacks are swift as thunder and lightning. Recently, the great victories in Jinzhou-Shenyang liberated the entire Northeast; the great victory in Huaihai thoroughly shook up Nanjing and Shanghai; and the great victory in Tianjin-Tanggu especially allowed the ancient capital of Beijing to be restored without bloodshed. The military achievements are brilliant and unprecedented. The completion of the revolution is just around the corner. However, the arch-criminal Chiang Kai-shek, though seemingly fleeing, and the evil American imperialists are still playing tricks. We hope that you will pursue the fleeing enemies with the supreme might and sweep away the roots of evil, laying the foundation for a boundless cause. Let no traitor be able to hide anywhere in the world, and let no conspiracy succeed, no matter how greedy and wolfish they may be. We have entered the liberated areas one after another. We are greatly encouraged by the constant stream of victories. We are willing to do our utmost to follow you closely, strengthen unity, and fight to the end for the construction of China. We respectfully send this telegram to congratulate you and express our regards. We hope that you will not forget us and give us guidance from time to time. Li Jishen, Shen Junru, Ma Xulun, Guo Moruo, Tan Pingshan, Peng Zemin, Zhang Bojun, Li Xijiu, Cai Tingkai, Zhou Jianren, Fu Dingyi, Zhang Naiqi, Li Dequan, Hu Yuzhi, Sha Qianli, Mao Dun, Zhu Xuefan, Chen Qiyou, Huang Zhensheng, Zhu Yunshan, Deng Chumin, Jian Bozan, Wang Shaojian, Wu Han, Xu Guangping, Chu Tunan, Qiu Zhe, Han Zhao'e, Xu Baoju, Tian Han, Hong Shen, Hou Wailu, Shen Zijiu, Huan Xiang, Yang Gang, Cao Mengjun, Li Wenyi, Luo Shuzhang, Liu Qingyang, Zhang Manjun, Shi Fuliang, Sun Qimeng, Yan Xinmin, Li Minxin, Mei Bibin, Shen Zhiyuan, Zhou Ying, An E, Wu Maosun, He Ju, Lin Yiyuan, Lai Yali, Kong Deque, Yuan Zhen, Shen Qiang, Wang Yunru.

February 1st

Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 2nd: Chairman Mao Zedong of the Chinese Communist Party and Commander-in-Chief Zhu De of the Chinese People's Liberation Army replied by telegram today to Li Jishen, Shen Junru, Ma Xulun, Guo Moruo, and the other fifty-six people. The telegram reads as follows: To Mr. Li Jishen, Mr. Shen Junru, Mr. Ma Xulun, Mr. Guo Moruo, Mr. Tan Pingshan, Mr. Peng Zemin, Mr. Zhang Bojun, Mr. Li Xijiu, Mr. Cai Tingkai, Mr. Zhou Jianren, Mr. Fu Dingyi, Mr. Zhang Naiqi, Mr. Li Dequan, Mr. Hu Yuzhi, Mr. Sha Qianli, Mr. Mao Dun, Mr. Zhu Xuefan, Mr. Chen Qiyou, Mr. Huang Zhensheng, Mr. Zhu Yunshan, Mr. Deng Chumin, Mr. Jian Bozan, Mr. Wang Shaojian, Mr. Wu Han, Mr. Xu Guangping, Mr. Chu Tunan, Mr. Qiu Zhe, Mr. Han Zhao'e, Mr. Xu Baoju, Mr. Tian Han, Mr. Hong Shen, Mr. Hou Wailu, Mr. Shen Zijiu, Mr. Huan Xiang, Mr. Yang Gang, Mr. Cao Mengjun, Mr. Li Wenyi, Mr. Luo Shuzhang, Mr. Liu Qingyang, Mr. Zhang Manjun, Mr. Shi Fuliang, Mr. Sun Qimeng, Mr. Yan Xinmin, Mr. Li Minxin, Mr. Mei Bibin, Mr. Shen Zhiyuan, Ms. Zhou Ying, Ms. An E, Mr. Wu Maosun, Mr. He Ju, Mr. Lin Yiyuan, Mr. Lai Yali, Mr. Kong Deque, Ms. Yuan Zhen, Mr. Shen Qiang, Ms. Wang Yunru:

We have received your telegram of February 1st and are very grateful for your kind sentiments. For over a hundred years, the liberation struggle of the Chinese nation and the Chinese people has been characterized by continuous efforts of those who went before, followed by those who came after. The blood of countless martyrs has been spilled across the beautiful land, and hundreds of millions of rising people have displayed heroic spirit. The reason for the victory of this People's Liberation War is that the people of the whole country, unafraid of violence, have united and struggled, and all democratic parties and people's organizations have risen up together and cooperated, thus enabling the People's Liberation Army to obtain assistance from all sides and completely isolate the people's enemy. The outcome of victory and defeat has therefore been determined. Now, the remaining enemies still exist and are constantly plotting. They seek respite under the guise of seeking peace, and they await foreign aid under the name of awaiting negotiations. They recite the Eight Articles with their mouths, protect war criminals with their hands, look to America with their eyes, and head towards Guangzhou with their feet. If we want the people's liberation struggle to achieve final victory, all democratic forces in the country must work together with one heart, persevere, and strive for a truly democratic peace. You, esteemed sirs, have long striven for the cause of democracy, and now that you have arrived in the liberated areas, you will surely enable the common cause of building a new China to achieve rapid success. We hereby send this telegram in reply to express our welcome.

Mao Zedong

Zhu De February 2nd

　　毛主席朱总司令电复李济深等民主人士
    望同德同心为真正民主的和平而奋斗
    【新华社陕北二日电】到达中国人民解放区的各民主党派、各人民团体的代表人物及其他民主人士李济深、沈钧儒、马叙伦、郭沫若等五十六人，于本月一日致电中国共产党毛泽东主席与中国人民解放军朱德总司令，庆祝人民解放战争的伟大胜利。电文如下：
    中国共产党主席毛泽东先生，中国人民解放军总司令朱德先生，并转全体战友均鉴：
    我人民解放大军，乃人民之武力，革命之前锋，作战以来，已二年有半矣。诸先生指挥若定，劳苦功高。诸战士俯仰如神，鞠躬尽瘁。旌旗所指，箪食壶浆。击刺之加，迅雷惊电。近者锦沈大捷，使东北全部解放；淮海大捷，使京沪彻底动摇；而津沽大捷，尤使北平古都兵不血刃而告光复。武功彪炳，空前未有。革命完成，指日可待。顾元凶蒋匪，虽若逋逃，助恶美帝，犹弄鬼蜮，务望追奔逐北，振至上之雄威；扫蒂除根，奠无疆之大业。任是天涯海角，使奸犯无处潜藏；纵有羊狠狼贪，令阴谋断难实现。同人等已先后进入解放区。叠奉捷音，不胜振奋。窃愿竭力追随，加紧团结，为中国之建设奋斗到底。谨电驰贺，并致慰劳。尚希不遗，时赐指导。李济深、沈钧儒、马叙伦、郭沫若、谭平山、彭泽民、章伯钧、李锡九、蔡廷锴、周建人、符定一、章乃器、李德全、胡愈之、沙千里、茅盾、朱学范、陈其尤、黄振声、朱蕴山、邓初民、翦伯赞、王绍鉴、吴晗、许广平、楚图南、丘哲、韩兆鹗、许宝驹、田汉、洪深、侯外卢、沈兹九、宦乡、杨刚、曹孟君、李文宜、罗淑章、刘清扬、张曼筠、施复亮、孙起孟、严信民、李民欣、梅弼彬、沈志远、周颖、安娥、吴茂荪、何惧、林一元、赖亚力、孔德＠、袁震、沈强、王蕴如。
    二月一日
    【新华社陕北二日电】中国共产党毛泽东主席、中国人民解放军朱德总司令，本日电复李济深、沈钧儒、马叙伦、郭沫若等五十六人。电文如下：李济深、沈钧儒、马叙伦、郭沫若、谭平山、彭泽民、章伯钧、李锡九、蔡廷锴、周建人、符定一、章乃器、李德全、胡愈之、沙千里、茅盾、朱学范、陈其尤、黄振声、朱蕴山、邓初民、翦伯赞、王绍鉴、吴晗、许广平、楚图南、丘哲、韩兆鹗、许宝驹、田汉、洪深、侯外卢、沈兹九、宦乡、杨刚、曹孟君、李文宜、罗淑章、刘清扬、张曼筠、施复亮、孙起孟、严信民、李民欣、梅弼彬、沈志远、周颖、安娥、吴茂荪、何惧、林一元、赖亚力、孔德＠、袁震、沈强、王蕴如诸先生共鉴：
    二月一日来电读悉，极成盛意。中华民族与中国人民的解放斗争，百余年来，前仆后继。无数先烈的鲜血，洒遍了锦绣山河，亿兆后起的人民，表现了英雄气概。此次人民解放战争之所以胜利，是由于全国人民不畏强暴，团结奋斗，各民主党派各人民团体一致奋起、相与协力，从而使人民解放军获得各方面的援助，使人民的敌人完全陷于孤立，胜负之数，因以判明。现在残敌尚存，诡谋时作。求喘息谓为求和平，待外援名曰待谈判。口诵八条，手庇战犯，眼望美国，脚向广州。欲求人民解放斗争获得最后胜利，必须全国一切民主力量同德同心，再接再厉，为真正民主的和平而奋斗。诸先生长期为民主事业而努力，现在到达解放区，必能使建设新中国的共同事业获得迅速的成功。特电布复，敬表欢迎。
    毛泽东
    　朱德　　二月二日
