　　Learn from the Soviet Worker-Peasant Heroes

　　Completed Fourteen Years' Plan in Three Years
　　There was a lathe worker in the Soviet Union named Seminsky, who worked at the Red Excavator Factory in Kyiv. Since the beginning of the Five-Year Plan, he had completed a personal production plan equivalent to fourteen years in just three years. This was the most anyone in Kyiv had accomplished. In metal processing, Seminsky was the first in Kyiv to use the fastest work methods. The technical improvements he adopted reduced production costs by hundreds of thousands of rubles. This year alone, he proposed twenty-three such improvements. Seminsky also combined work and study; he is currently enrolled in the correspondence program (studying via correspondence) at the Polytechnic Institute, in his second year.

　　Saving Raw Materials, Learning from Each Other
　　In Soviet factories, Stakhanovite workers meet every Tuesday to exchange experiences; each person introduces their new inventions or improved working methods. Who initiated this? It was Levchenko. She is a female worker in a boot and shoe factory. Through constant and dedicated research, she finally invented a new method for cutting leather. Ordinary cutting workers can only utilize 70 to 72 percent of the leather, but Levchenko can utilize 91 percent. Using this method, she saves enough leather annually to make 5,000 pairs of boots. If all the cutting workers in the country used her method, the result would be millions of pairs of boots and shoes produced over plan without spending a bit more raw materials! Levchenko now leads the socialist competition among cutting workers in the Soviet Union's boot and shoe industry. Since she initiated "Stakhanovite Tuesdays," newspapers have reported that many cities, collective farms, and factories have followed her example and achieved great success. Levchenko's success did not come easily; she spent many nights without sleep, planning, calculating, arranging shoe patterns, and writing notes. She also studied in factory supplementary classes, read many books, and received help from engineers and work team leaders.

　　Improving Working Methods, Receiving the Stalin Prize
　　In the micrometer manufacturing department of the "Caliber" factory in Moscow, there is a work team leader named Rossiysky, who is well-known throughout the Soviet Union. Because he improved working methods and was good at training workers, every man and woman in his group became a Stakhanovite. But once, a highly skilled worker fell ill, and no one could replace him. This problem had to be solved quickly, and the team leader was troubled. So he consulted with the factory's technologist, Kolencheva. Kolencheva thought that the work was too specialized and difficult to master, so she simplified the work procedures. She divided the work into several simple procedures, which ordinary skilled workers could also do. Not only that, but in this way, the quality and quantity of products were improved, and it also inspired other workers to research more effective methods. Later, Kolencheva boldly tried using direct continuous feeding method, making the working method more direct and simple, thus greatly increasing production and reducing costs. Last year, Rossiysky's team manufactured more micrometers than planned for 1950. They jumped ahead by three years in time. Kolencheva received the Stalin Prize for this achievement.

　　Researching Wheat Varieties
　　Snekova was a woman from a poor peasant family in the old Russian era. Like most poor girls, her childhood was devoid of joy. She spent her days running errands for the landlords and nobles who lived nearby, herding cattle, threshing grain, and cutting grass. But in the Soviet era, this Russian village girl became a famous scientist. She has diplomas in agronomy and breeding. She has been in this profession for twenty-four years. Her meticulous research and determined, earnest nature have made her talents a valuable contribution to agricultural science. Originally, in the high-yielding areas of Stavropol and Krasnodar, wheat suffered from bunt and other fungal diseases, which greatly harmed the harvest. Snekova spent five years researching breeding and selecting varieties, and finally succeeded. She cultivated a winter wheat called "Voroshilov," which has many advantages: it turns green early, yields a lot, and is both cold-resistant and drought-resistant. This wheat variety is currently very popular in the Don River basin, the Kuban River basin, Ukraine, Crimea, and other places. After the war, she cultivated five more high-yielding wheat varieties and one spring wheat variety called "Pioneer." All of these varieties are resistant to bunt. Snekova received the Stalin Prize for this.

　　向苏联工农英雄们学习
  　三年完成了十四年的计划
    苏联有一个旋床工人，名叫谢明斯基，在基辅红色掘凿机制造厂干活。自从五年计划开始以来，他三年的工夫已经完成了十四年的个人生产计划了。这在基辅说来，是干活干的顶多的了。在处理金属方面，谢明斯基是基辅市里第一个使用顶快的工作法的人。他采用的技术改进，可以减低生产成本数十万卢布。光今年他就提出了二十三件这样的改良。谢明斯基还把工作和学习结合起来，他现在正参加工学院的函授班（用通信的办法学习），在第二年级学习。
    节省原料，互相学习
    在苏联的工厂里，每星期二，斯达哈诺夫工人都要开会，交换经验；各人自己介绍自己的新发明，或者新改进的工作方法。这件事是谁发起的呢？就是莱夫浅科。她是一家靴鞋工厂的女工，由于不断地苦心研究，她终于发明了一种剪裁皮子的新法子。普通剪裁工人只能利用皮子到百分之七十至七十二，但是莱夫浅科却能利用到百分之九十一，她使用这个法子每年节省的皮子足够做五千双靴子的。如果全国的剪裁工人都使用她的法子，结果将不用多费一点原料，就能制造出超计划的靴鞋千百万双！莱夫浅科现在领导着苏联全国靴鞋业剪裁工人的社会主义竞赛。自从她发起“斯达哈诺夫星期二”以后，报纸上报导出来，于是许多城市、农庄和工厂，都学习她的榜样，得到了伟大的成就。莱夫浅科能有这样的成功，也很不容易，她曾多少晚上不睡觉，计划、算计安排鞋样、写笔记。她还在工厂补习班学习，看过不少书，也曾得到工程师和工作组长的帮助。
    改进工作法，得到斯大林奖金
    在莫斯科“口径”工厂测微计制造部里，有一位工作组长，名叫罗西意斯基，这个人在苏联可以说是远近出名。他由于改进了工作方法，并善于训练工人，所以他那一组每一位男女工人都成了斯达哈诺夫运动者了。但是有一次，一个技术很高的工人病了，没有人能替他。这个问题必须赶紧解决，组长为难了。于是他就找到了工厂的技术学家柯连切瓦商量。柯连切瓦一想，工作太专门，不易熟练，就把工作手续弄简单了。她把这件工作分为好些简便的手续，普通技术工人也就能干了。不但如此，这样一来，产品的质和量都提高了，并且还引起了别的工人研究出更有效的方法。以后柯连切瓦又大胆试用了直接连送法，把干活的法子变得更直接简便了，于是大大提高了产量，减低了成本。去年罗西意斯基这一组制造的测微计就有计划上规定的一九五○年的那末多了。他们在时间上蹦了三年。柯连切瓦因为这种成绩，得到了斯大林奖金。
    研究麦种
    斯涅可瓦是旧俄时代出身于贫农家庭的女子。她小时候和一般穷家女儿一样，过的生活一点乐趣没有，每天给住在附近的地主和贵族跑腿，看牛、打谷、割草。但是到了苏维埃时代，这个俄国乡村姑娘，却成了著名的科学家了。她有农艺学和选种学的毕业文凭，她在这一行干了二十四年了。她的细心研究和坚决认真的性情，使她的才能对于农业科学有了宝贵的贡献。原来在斯塔夫罗宝里和克拉斯诺达尔两处产量的地方，小麦有一种丹病和别的微菌病，对于收获大有妨害。斯涅可瓦费了五年的工夫，研究配种、选种，最后成功了。她培养了一种冬麦，名叫“伏罗希洛夫”，有许多长处：热的早，产的多，又耐寒又抗干。这份麦种现时在顿河流域、库班流域、乌克兰，克里米里等处，已经十分流行了。战争以后，她又培养出五种产量很高的麦种，和一种春麦，名叫“先锋”。所有这些品种，都不生丹病。斯涅可瓦因此得到了斯大林奖金。
