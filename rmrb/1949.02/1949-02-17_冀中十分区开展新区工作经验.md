　　Jizhong Tenth Military Subdistrict
  　Experience in Developing New District Work
    Since the beginning of the Pingjin Campaign, more than 1,500 villages and towns in the Jizhong Tenth Military Subdistrict, which had been under the long-term rule of the Kuomintang reactionary government and army, were completely liberated. Under the correct leadership of the Party committees at all levels and the efforts of all cadres, the Party's new district policy began to be implemented, and new district work was gradually carried out. In the initial work, several main experiences in developing new district work were initially gained:

    (1) Widely use all possible forces to carry out new district work. First of all, in order to overcome the difficulty of having few cadres in a large area, in addition to sending working groups, Party schools, public security training classes, and teacher training classes to work in the area, the prefectural committee also transferred a large number of village cadres to form working teams to invest in the vast new district work. Under the leadership of county and district cadres, they entered the new district to work and learn at the same time. In places like Gu'an, Shengfang, and Zhuoliangwan, they also planned to mobilize and organize primary school teachers, local poor refugees, active elements among the dependents of military industrial martyrs, and personnel who had worked with us in the past to assist in carrying out new district work. At the same time, a large number of excellent militiamen from the old liberated areas were organized to serve as social security maintenance and to assist the main force in suppressing the remaining bandits. The organization and use of these forces gave great convenience to the development of new district work, which partially solved the difficulties of having few cadres, weak forces, large areas, and heavy tasks.

    　　　　Suppressing Remaining Armed Enemies, Establishing Revolutionary Order

    (2) Clearing out the remaining bandits and searching for the enemy's hidden weapons is work of paramount importance in the new district. After entering the new district, different working methods were adopted for this work according to different regions and different times: In areas where the enemy's armed forces had been rapidly annihilated or defeated by our army, we immediately organized all our armed forces, and relentlessly pursued and suppressed the remaining enemies without interruption, seizing the opportunity when the enemy was collapsing. Immediately afterwards, in the context of popular enthusiasm and enemy panic, a propaganda offensive was launched, relying on active elements among the masses to conduct in-depth investigations and carry out mass secret reporting and denunciations, in order to thoroughly clear out the remaining bandits and special agents. Regarding the search for the enemy's hidden weapons, the enemy weapons seized since the launch of the new district work included: 37 60mm mortars and grenade launchers, 95 machine guns, 3,611 rifles and carbines, 603 pistols, and 28 automatic rifles. In areas where the enemy's armed forces were larger and the enemy's ruling foundation was deeper, we focused on eliminating the enemy's armed forces, combined with propaganda, and adopted a method of combining targeted point strikes with comprehensive clearing, striving to quickly eliminate the enemy's armed forces to stabilize the revolutionary order in the new district.

    (3) Combining military suppression with simultaneous registration and control of enemy and puppet organization personnel, quickly suppressing the hidden activities of bandits and special agents, and initially stabilizing social order. When conducting universal registration of enemy and puppet organization personnel, we first carried out propaganda on the situation and education on our Party's lenient policy. Three specific methods were adopted in the registration: First, breaking through key points to drive the general. Second, convening meetings of puppet Baojia personnel, repeatedly publicizing our Party's lenient policy, and ordering all enemy and puppet organization personnel to register with the democratic government. Third, conducting in-depth investigations to collect enemy and puppet documents. During the registration, education on the situation and policies was carried out, and at the same time, in accordance with the spirit of "punishing the chief culprits, not questioning those who were coerced, and rewarding those who perform meritorious service," necessary and severe suppression was adopted against counter-revolutionary elements who refused to turn back and continued to do evil, and those who were die-hard.

    　　　　Relying on the Broad Masses, Destroying the Puppet Baojia System

    (4) Destroying the puppet Baojia system, relying on the broad masses, and establishing democratic power. In general areas, new political power organizations were established mostly with our previously hidden organizational forces and active elements among the poor peasants, farm laborers, and middle peasants. While destroying the puppet Baojia organizations, the counter-revolutionary elements who had committed heinous crimes and were most hated by the masses among the puppet organization personnel were given their due punishment, which raised the morale of the masses. In areas where our working foundation was weak, some puppet Baojia personnel were used separately to form support-the-front committees in order to complete the heavy task of supporting the front; they carried out support-the-front work under the supervision of the masses. However, due to the vague viewpoints and positions of some of our cadres, many places experienced the right-leaning errors of transferring and condoning, and the use of puppet personnel was not reviewed and selected, which gave some bad elements an opportunity to take advantage of, and dampened the morale of the masses. For example, in the first district of Daxing County, two puppet major township chiefs who were hated by the masses were mistakenly regarded as "backbones" in the work. In the levy work, they did not exempt the dependents of soldiers from levies, but tried to take care of the landlords. When the masses in the fifth district of Ba County spontaneously rose up and demanded the overthrow of the enemy and puppet regime, our district cadres not only failed to support the masses and lead the masses to establish our organization, but instead mistakenly obstructed them, completely losing their position. These erroneous deviations have now begun to be actively corrected.

    (5) Conscientiously implement the burden policy, improve the class consciousness of the masses, and ensure on-the-spot supply during wartime. In the borrowing and requisitioning work, all localities universally publicized the democratic government's burden methods to the masses, appeased the masses, exposed the phenomena of landlords and reactionary elements relying on enemy and puppet forces to conceal black land, evade burdens, and the serious and unreasonable burdens in the villages (such as land tax by mu, miscellaneous levies by household. Sometimes miscellaneous levies exceeded land tax by one time, and poor people had to take out grain even when conscripted), which improved the consciousness of the masses and a large number of active elements among the peasants emerged. For example, in Dashulou Sang Village, Zhuoliangwan, after I announced the borrowing and requisitioning method, a young man took the initiative to say to our district cadres: "Li Shizhen, the big landlord in our village with more than three qing of land, has never been on duty. He can't be arrogant this time." Incomplete statistics from Anci, Zhuoliangwan, and Gu'an counties alone show that 2,984,297 catties of millet were borrowed and requisitioned, ensuring the supply to the front. However, in some areas, due to the lack of serious inspection of the implementation of the burden policy by county and district leaders, some puppet personnel sabotaged it and illegally modified the burden method without authorization, causing an imbalance in the burden of some villages. The leading organs of the new district counties and districts must pay attention to this issue and check and correct it.

### 冀中十分区开展新区工作经验

　　冀中十分区
  　开展新区工作经验
    自平津战役开始后，冀中十分区被国民党反动政府和军队长期统治下的一千五百多个村镇，完全获得解放。在各级党委的正确领导与全体干部的努力下，开始贯彻党的新区政策，逐渐开展了新区工作。在初期工作中并初步获得了开辟新区工作的几项主要经验：
    （一）广泛使用一切可能使用的力量开展新区工作。首先为了克服地区大干部少的困难。地委除把工作团、党校、治安训练班、教员训练班等派往该区工作外，并抽调大批村干部，组成工作队投入广大新区工作。在县区干部的带领下，进入新区一面工作一面学习。固安、胜芳、涿良宛等地，并有计划的发动与组织小学教师、当地贫苦难民、军工烈属中的积极分子和过去与我们有工作关系的人员来协助开展新区工作。同时并组织老解放区大批的优秀民兵去充任维持社会治安与协助主力肃清残匪的任务。这些力量的组织使用，给了开展新区工作以很大便利，这就部分的解决了干部少力量弱地区大任务重的困难。
    　　　　肃清残敌武装　建立革命秩序
    （二）清剿残匪搜缴敌人的隐藏武器，这在新区是具有头等意义的工作。进入新区后，在这一工作上，根据不同地区不同时机采取了不同的工作方法：对敌人武装力量已被我大军迅速歼灭或击溃的地区，就抓紧敌人正在溃乱的时候，立即组织起我们的所有武装力量，勇猛的不间歇的追歼清剿残敌。紧接着又在群情振奋与敌人惊恐不安的情况下，展开宣传攻势，发动依靠群众中的积极分子，进行深入调查，开展群众性的秘报和检举运动，以达到彻底清剿残余匪特。搜缴敌人的隐藏武器，从开展新区工作以来所收缴的敌人武器有：六零炮及掷弹筒三十七个、机枪九十五挺、步马枪三千六百一十一支、手枪六百零三支、自动步枪二十八支。对敌人武装力量较大敌人统治基础较深的地区，我们则是以消灭敌人的武装力量为主，结合开展宣传，采用有目的的点突击与面的清剿相结合的方法，争取迅速肃清敌人的武装力量，以稳定新区的革命秩序。
    （三）结合军事清剿，同时进行敌伪组织人员的登记控制，迅速捕灭匪特的隐蔽活动，初步稳定了社会秩序。在进行普遍登记敌伪组织人员时，首先开展了形势宣传与我党宽大政策的教育。登记中采取了三个具体办法：第一是突破重点带动一般。第二是召集伪保甲人员会议，反复宣传我党的宽大政策，责令一切敌伪组织人员都须到民主政府登记。第三是深入调查搜集敌伪文件，在登记中，进行了形势和政策教育，同时根据“首恶者必办，胁从者不问，立功者受奖”的精神，对死不回头继续作恶，死心踏地的反革命分子，采取了必要的严厉镇压。
    　　　　依靠广大群众　摧毁伪保甲制度
    （四）摧毁伪保甲制度，依靠广大群众，建立民主政权。一般地区多是以我们过去隐蔽下去的组织力量与贫雇农和中农中的积极分子建立起新的政权组织。一面摧毁伪保甲组织，同时对伪组织人员中罪大恶极为群众最痛恨的反革命分子，给予了应得的惩处，提高了群众情绪。在我工作基础较薄弱的地区，当时为了完成繁重的支前任务，曾分别使用了一些伪保甲人员，组成支前委员会；在群众监督下进行支前工作。但由于我们某些干部的观点立场模糊，不少地方发生了迁移姑息的右倾错误，对伪人员的使用不加审查选择，因此给了某些坏分子以可乘之机，而打击了群众情绪。如大兴县一区把两个为群众所痛恨的伪大乡长，错误当成工作中的“骨干”，在征收工作中他们不给军属除免征点，而想法照顾地主。霸县五区群众自动起来要求推翻敌伪政权时，我区干部不但不为群众撑腰，领导群众建立我之组织，反而错误的进行阻拦，完全丧失了立场。这些错误偏向现已开始积极纠正。
    （五）认真贯彻负担政策，提高群众阶级觉悟，保证了战时就地取给。各地在借征工作中，普遍向群众宣传民主政府的负担办法，安抚群众，揭发地主反动分子仗敌伪势力隐瞒黑地，逃避负担，以及村中负担严重不合理的现象（如田赋按亩，杂差按户。有时杂差超过田赋一倍穷人被征兵还得拿出粮食等），提高了群众觉悟，涌现了不少农民中的积极分子。如涿良宛大树楼桑村，我宣布借征办法后，一个青年主动向我区干部说：“俺村三顷多地的大财主李士珍历来不出差，这回他可不能再威风了。”仅就安次、涿良宛、固安三县极不完全的统计，即借征小米二百九十八万四千二百九十七斤，保证了前方供给。但有些地区因县区领导上对贯彻负担政策检查不够认真，有些伪人员从中破坏，擅自违法修改负担办法，造成某些村庄的负担不平衡现象。新区各县区领导机关对此问题必须引起重视并检查纠正。
