　　Large-Scale Promotion and Training of Cadres
  　Shandong Dazhong Daily Editorial
    As the revolutionary situation rapidly develops, East China urgently needs to prepare a large number of cadres capable of undertaking various tasks at all levels, in order to take over the vast rural areas and many cities that are about to be liberated. To this end, Shandong Dazhong Daily published an editorial entitled "Promoting and Training a Large Number of Cadres to Greet the National Revolutionary Victory." The editorial first pointed out the current victorious situation and the various favorable conditions such as the existing foundation of cadres in East China, while also pointing out that cadres are always in short supply, and that some cadres also have shortcomings such as localism, which must be overcome. It then stated that in order to complete the glorious and great task of supplying a large number of cadres to work in the new areas, it is necessary to pay full attention to the past experiences and lessons in transferring cadres, and to prevent and avoid deviations in the work of transferring cadres to the new areas. It is necessary to intensify ideological, political, and organizational mobilization, in conjunction with education against indiscipline and anarchism. It is necessary to ensure that a large number of cadres are transferred out and are competent and happy to work in the new areas, and that the work of the original organizations at all levels is not affected as a result. Regarding how to quickly and effectively complete the task of training and promoting cadres on a large scale, the editorial provided the following specific suggestions: First, conduct thorough investigation and research to become familiar with one's own cadres. Study the strengths and weaknesses of cadres (with particular emphasis on cadres at all levels and in all positions who bear major work responsibilities), and familiarize oneself with whether they faithfully implement the correct line and policies of the CCP Central Committee, their organizational concept and spirit of discipline, their physical health, family life, and so on. Only by being familiar with cadres can we correctly promote and train cadres, and correctly allocate and use cadres. Second, it is necessary to correctly, actively, and boldly promote cadres. The broad masses of Communist Party member cadres and general revolutionary cadres have participated in the War of Resistance Against Japan, the War of Liberation, rent reduction and interest reduction, land reform and other national and class struggles, as well as production and disaster relief and other tests, have shown loyalty and bravery, have made meritorious achievements in completing tasks, and have prestige among the people, should be quickly and systematically promoted at all levels. Many cadres who have worked in one position for many years, whose experience is rich, and whose quality is excellent, should be promoted as soon as possible. In all kinds of important work positions at all levels, deputy positions should be added across the board, so that cadres at all levels holding deputy positions can be tempered in actual work, in preparation for future promotion and use. This method of setting up deputy positions should become one of the most important methods of preparing cadres. Third, speed up the running of Party schools, strengthen the leadership of Party schools, and improve the educational guidelines and plans of Party schools, in order to improve the theoretical level and policy level of Communist Party member cadres, enhance Party spirit, and improve work style. Actively run district and village cadre training classes to train a large number of district and village cadres, and improve the ideological style, policy level, and working ability of district and village cadres. The Communist Party committees at all levels must strengthen the education of various cadres currently in service. Fourth, various secondary and higher schools and training classes in various places should absorb a large number of workers, educated youths, and technical talents into our schools or training classes in the newly liberated areas and cities. Improve their political understanding, transform their thinking, and stimulate their revolutionary enthusiasm. After graduation, they can be appropriately assigned to work. The East China University, Military and Political University, Agricultural Specialized School, Industrial Specialized School, Commercial Specialized School, Transportation School, etc., should strengthen their political and organizational leadership, in order to cultivate various talents more quickly to meet the needs of revolutionary development. Fifth, the organizational departments of the Communist Party committees in various regions should make systematic registration and statistics of the work cadres who are now supporting the front lines of the People's Liberation War, and strengthen political work. The large number of cadres supporting the front lines must be closely monitored, and at an appropriate time they should be assigned to work in their original places. Sixth, we must care for cadres and concretely solve the difficult problems of cadres. For example, pay attention to the physical health of cadres, and pay attention to disease and medicine. For example, take care of the family difficulties of cadres transferred to work in the new areas, and reduce the concerns of cadres. All local cadres who have been transferred to work in the new areas in the past and in the future will be treated as military dependents, and the local governments should publicly announce this in writing and ensure its implementation.

　　大批提拔和培养干部
  　山东大众日报社论
    【新华社华东二日电】随着革命形势的迅速发展，华东地区亟须准备大批能担任各级各项工作的干部，以便去接管即将解放的广大农村和许多城市。为此，山东大众日报特以“提拔和培养大批干部迎接全国革命胜利”为题发表社论。该社论首先指明目前胜利形势及华东干部的已有基础等各种有利条件，同时又指出干部总是供不应求，而且某些干部中还存在着地方观念等缺点，须注意克服。继称：为完成供给大批干部到新区工作的光荣伟大任务，必须充分注意过去调动干部中的经验教训，防止和避免调动干部到新区工作中发生偏差。必须加紧进行思想的政治的组织的动员，配合反无纪律无政府状态的教育。必须既做到调出大批干部都很称职，都很愉快地到新区去工作，又要保证原有各级各项组织的工作不因此受到影响。关于如何迅速而有效地完成大量地培养训练和提拔干部的任务，社论提供了如下的具体意见：第一、切实调查研究，熟悉自己的干部。研究干部的优点和缺点（特别着重研究各级各项担负主要工作责任的干部），熟悉他们是否忠实执行中共中央的正确路线政策，其组织观念及遵守纪律的精神，身体健康，家庭生活情况等等。只有熟悉了干部，才能正确地提拔与培养干部，正确地分配与使用干部。第二、必须正确、积极和大胆地提拔干部。广大的共产党员干部以及一般的革命干部参加过抗日战争、解放战争、减租减息、土地改革等民族斗争与阶级斗争，以及生产救灾等考验，表现忠实勇敢，完成任务有功绩，并在人民中有威信者，都应迅速地有计划地按级提拔起来。很多干部在一个职位上做了多年的工作，其经验丰富，品质优良者更应尽先提拔。在各级各种重要工作岗位上，应一律增设副职，使各级担任副职的干部，都能在实际工作中得到锻炼，以备将来提拔使用。此项设立副职的办法，应成为准备干部的最重要的方法之一。第三、加紧办理党校，加强党校的领导，改进党校的教育方针和计划，以提高共产党党员干部的理论水平，政策水平，增强党性，改善作风。积极开办区、村干部训练班，训练大批区、村干部，提高区、村干部的思想作风、政策水平和工作能力。共产党的各级党委必须加强各种在职干部的教育。第四、各地各种性质的中等以上的学校和训练班应在新解放区和城市中，吸收大批工人、知识青年及技术人才到我们学校或训练班来学习。提高其政治认识，改造其思想，激发其革命热情，毕业之后，可适当地分配其工作。对华东大学、军政大学、农业专门学校、工业专门学校、商业专门学校、交通学校等，应加强其政治与组织领导，以便更快地培养各种人才，以适应革命发展的需要。第五、对于现在支援人民解放战争前线的工作干部，各地区共产党党委组织部应作系统的登记统计，并加强政治工作。对大批支援前线的干部，要加紧掌握，在适当时期归原地分配工作。第六、必须关心干部，具体解决干部的困难问题。如注意干部的身体健康，注意疾病医药。如照顾调往新区工作干部的家庭困难，减少干部的顾虑。凡过去及今后调往新区工作的地方干部，其家庭一律按军属待遇，各地政府应明文公布，并切实保证执行。
