Xinhua News Agency, Central Plains, 22nd: Around the Spring Festival, various regions in western Henan and the Henan-Anhui-Jiangsu border region have universally launched movements to support the army and movements to support the government and cherish the people. Six counties, including Jieshou, Xinzheng, Yiyang, Zheng County, and Yu County, have donated a total of 698,900+ yuan in comfort funds, 59,700+ jin of pork, 37 fat pigs, and a large number of towels and soaps. In counties such as Jia County and Luyi, committees for preferential treatment of military families have been organized to help military families solve their living difficulties. The Ningping District of Luyi distributed a total of 133,000 jin of preferential grain, which was distributed to more than 600 poor military families. Before the Lunar New Year, the masses in the Second District of Yu County held a victory celebration and army support meeting. More than 2,000 farmers carried more than 70 loads of pork, mutton, and other comfort goods to comfort the People's Liberation Army. An old lady in the Chengguan District of Yiyang voluntarily took out 40 yuan (Central Plains currency, same below) and six eggs from her hard-earned savings to comfort the army, and wrote in a comfort letter: "Since the People's Liberation Army came, my life has been better. I am giving the money I earned from spinning to the People's Liberation Army comrades to buy a pack of cigarettes, and these six eggs are for the comrades who were injured fighting for the people to eat." Sixteen employees of the Yu County Post Office voluntarily donated 6,130 yuan and daily necessities such as towels and toothpaste, and expressed their efforts to strengthen postal work and quickly spread the news of victory from the front. Workers from thirteen towel factories in Jieshou took their wages and bought fifty packs of cigarettes to dedicate to the soldiers on the front lines. On New Year's Day, cadres and the masses in various places hung honorary plaques and honorary lanterns for military families and paid New Year's greetings to military families. In order to thank the people for their love and strengthen the unity between the military and the government and the people, the People's Liberation Army universally launched a movement to support the government and cherish the people in the villages where they were stationed. The "Longhai" troops automatically carried water and swept the yards for their landlords. On New Year's Day, they lined up to pay New Year's greetings to the local government and the masses, and generally sought opinions. These troops invited government personnel and landlords to eat.
