　　Hebei, Shandong and Henan
　　Cadre Training Successfully Completed in Various Parts
　　[Hebei, Shandong and Henan Telegraph] Party committees, county committees, special commissioner's offices, and county governments at all levels in Hebei, Shandong, and Henan have completed the enormous task of training more than 30,000 party members, village cadres, and over 1,000 intellectuals, based on the needs of the situation and work. The ideological and policy levels of the cadres have been greatly improved during the training, and they have become a strong force for completing various current tasks. A number of cadres have been promoted and separated from production to participate in work. Since the Regional Party Committee issued instructions on running village cadre training classes on June 28th of last year, from August to the end of December, a total of 151 training classes were held throughout the region, training a total of 33,848 people. Among them, taking the Sixth Special District as an example, the ratio of party members to non-party members was 96.8%. The qualifications of the trainees were generally village cadres, branch committee members, group leaders, activists, and better elements. In terms of the training process, it generally started with explaining the situation and the purpose of party rectification, in order to correct attitudes, dispel concerns, and stabilize emotions. Then, policies were explained, linked to practice, and work was reviewed to achieve a combination of learning and application. Afterwards, basic party knowledge and party rectification education were taught, combined with review and reflection to raise awareness. Finally, summaries, tests, and appraisals were conducted. The training time was mostly about half a month, with longer sessions lasting three to four weeks, and the shortest lasting ten days. The trainees who participated in the study generally gained a lot. The main manifestations are: (1) At the beginning, party members had many misunderstandings about party rectification: they thought that party rectification was "rectifying people" and "finding faults," so they were negative and dissatisfied, afraid of tracing their thoughts, afraid of being punished, and afraid of being handed over to the masses for handling; some held the attitude of complaining and boasting to the leadership; some were worried about being promoted and transferred elsewhere. After conducting party rectification education and basic party knowledge education, they understood the purpose of curing diseases and saving people, enlightened their awareness, launched criticism and self-criticism, and reviewed their mistakes. In Yuncheng, in conjunction with the education of basic knowledge, the heroic deeds of the Long March and comrades like Li Dazhao and Fang Zhimin were told, and many trainees were moved to tears, and the idea of complaining and boasting was also eliminated. From complaining and boasting, they quickly turned to examining themselves and stimulated a sense of responsibility and work enthusiasm. Some village cadres automatically returned the things they had over-occupied after returning to the village. (2) When the trainees came, they generally did not understand the policies, thinking that the policies "changed too fast," that they were not allowed to use coercion or commandism, and they could not be the tail of the masses, which made them feel embarrassed. After explaining the policies and discussing them in connection with the actual situation and typical analysis, they overcame the absolute egalitarian agricultural socialist ideology, resolved various confused ideas about landlords and returning corps, distinguished the enemy from ourselves, and clarified their policy concepts. After returning to their villages, the trainees generally became active executors of policies, influencing and promoting untrained cadres, and playing a positive leading role in completing work tasks. (3) Through the training classes, a lot of practical materials from the countryside were learned. The various tasks of the branch and the village were studied in detail. (4) A number of community cadres were promoted from the training classes. According to incomplete statistics, 175 cadres have been promoted to be separated from production, and 15 are partially separated from production in eight counties including Dong'a and Zhuxian.

　　冀鲁豫各地
  　集训干部胜利完成
    【冀鲁豫电】冀鲁豫各地委、县委、专署、县府根据形势和工作需要，完成集训三万多党员、村干及千余知识分子的巨大任务，集训中干部思想政策水平大大提高，并成为完成当前各种任务的坚强力量。提拔了一批干部脱离生产，参加工作。自区党委于去年六月二十八日发出关于开办村干训练班的指示后，由八月至十二月底为止，全区共开办训练班一百五十一期，共训练了三万三千八百四十八人。其中党员与非党员的比例，以六专区为例，党员占受训人数的百分之九十六点八。学员条件一般为村干、支委、小组长、积极分子与较好分子。在训练的程序上，一般是先从讲形势、整党目的入手，以端正态度、解除顾虑，稳定情绪。接着再讲政策，联系实际，检查工作，达到学用结合。然后讲党员基本知识与整党教育，并结合进行检查反省，提高觉悟。最后再进行总结、测验、鉴定。训练时间多为半月左右，较长者三周至四周，最短者十天。参加学习的学员，一般的均获得很大收获。主要表现在：（一）开始党员对整党有很多误解：认为整党是“整人”“找岔子”，因而消极不满，怕追思想，怕受处分，怕交群众处理；有的抱着向领导上诉苦表功的态度；有的挂家怕提拔，怕外调等等。经过进行整党教育和党的基本知识教育后，认识了治病救人的目的，启发了觉悟，开展了批评与自我批评，检查了错误。郓城在结合基本知识的教育中，讲了长征及李大钊、方志敏等同志的壮烈事迹，学员被感动得哭的很多，诉苦表功的思想也一笔勾消了。从诉苦表功很快转向了检查自己，并激发了责任心与工作情绪。有的村干回村后自动退出多占的东西。（二）学员来时，一般对政策不摸底，认为政策“变的太快”，既不许强迫命令，又不能当群众尾巴，感到为难。在讲解政策并联系实际情况进行讨论与典型分析后，克服了绝对平均的农业社会主义思想，解决了对地主、还乡团的各种糊涂思想，划清了敌我界限，明确了政策观念。学员回村后，一般都变成了执行政策的积极分子，响影与推动了未受训的干部，对完成工作任务起了积极领导作用。（三）通过训练班了解到不少农村的实际材料。把支部和村里的各种工作都作了详细的研究。（四）从训练班中提拔了一批小区干部，据不完全的统计：东阿、筑先等八县，已提拔脱离生产的干部有一百七十五人，半脱离生产的十五人。
