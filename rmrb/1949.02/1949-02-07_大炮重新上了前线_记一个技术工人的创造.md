　　Cannons Return to the Front Lines
  　A Technical Worker’s Innovation

    "These cannons were earned by the People's Liberation Army with blood and sweat. The vile bandit army damaged the breechblocks and parts. To protect our happy lives, we must use every means to repair them! We must build a strong artillery corps. You must know that the army needs it!..." Director Liu of the Military Region Armament Repair Plant said with a smile, pointing to the tall cannon, to worker Wang Xinzheng.

    The cannons were captured by the People's Liberation Army when annihilating the enemy at Yangshan. Because they couldn't be used without breechblocks, they were transported back from the front lines. When this tall monster met the comrades in the factory, it was just a straight tube, as if an animal had been gutted. Everyone who saw it stuck out their tongues: "Not to mention repairing it, we've never even seen one before!" "We're clumsy, and you want us to repair foreign goods, who can do it?" The workers discussed among themselves. Even Director Liu, who had the most experience in repairing firearms, hesitated. After much consideration, he decided to assign this task to Comrade Wang Xinzheng.

    When Xinzheng heard what Director Liu told him, his heart pounded, and it felt like a stone was pressing on his head. He didn't dare accept such a big task. Director Liu mobilized him several times, telling him to be bold and creative. Only then did Xinzheng agree: "I'll give it a try!"

    In the days after accepting the task, Comrade Xinzheng felt uneasy. He couldn't sleep at night, tossing and turning. As soon as he closed his eyes, the tall cannon vaguely appeared in front of him. Sometimes he saw the cannon wheels, sometimes he saw the director talking to him... These scenes repeatedly revolved in his mind. "Although I've learned about repairing weapons and drawn rough drawings, those were just small things on small cannons and machine guns. Fitting a breechblock on such a big cannon is beyond me!" He forcefully suppressed the thought that had just been mobilized, and thought about the problem of fitting the breechblock. "I only promised Director Liu to try. If it doesn't work, so be it. Wasn't it sent here from the Hebei-Shandong-Henan area because they couldn't build it there? If it can't be built here, it will still be sent elsewhere!" He continued to think like this. "Although I learned about repairing weapons..." Thinking of this, he suddenly remembered the miserable situation of working in the old factory when he learned to repair weapons. He thought: In the old factory, he couldn't even get enough to eat, and he was treated as a slave by the factory. He also thought: Being driven by the enemy to work, the hideous enemy made him work day and night, exhausted his muscles and bones, and didn't pay him wages. There wasn't enough to eat, let alone wear. He was like a beggar all year round, and his family cried in hunger... He almost shed tears. In a flash, the bright and happy life appeared before his eyes. Since being liberated, the leaders and fellow workers have been so considerate and caring to him. More than 400 catties of rice a month, enough for him to eat and wear and support his family, and he was even promoted to squad leader... "This is heaven, that was hell!" He couldn't help but exclaim, startling his comrades awake. "The People's Liberation Army needs it, I must build it well." To protect this heavenly life, he made this determination. So, on those hot summer days, Comrade Wang Xinzheng sacrificed his lunch break to carefully draw designs. He was covered in sweat but didn't bother to wipe it off. In the late nights, when mosquitoes were so annoying and stinging, he was in his simply equipped room, under the flickering kerosene lamp, designing, and hurriedly taking the time to guide the workers in manufacturing. During this period, he ate much less, and his face looked haggard. Director Liu was afraid he would get sick from exhaustion and asked him to rest, but he refused. "The People's Liberation Army needs it!" He often said this. Whenever a machine part was made, his face would be filled with joy. The breechblock, composed of complex machine parts, was finally completed under his design and the workers' meticulous manufacturing. At this time, Comrade Xinzheng finally breathed a sigh of relief.

    When the test firing began, people watched his final success with curiosity, but after the first shot, it stopped firing and couldn't launch anymore. The audience shook their heads and said, "We said it was a waste of effort!" Someone was mocking. Comrade Xinzheng suppressed his annoyance, not discouraged at all, and calmly explored the problem. He finally found the reason: the breechblock didn't have enough gas accumulation. "Not enough air! Try again!" He thought. More than a dozen young men gathered around again to pump air. The large air tubes made the workers so strenuous. The young worker squad leader was bare-chested, and sweat dripped from his head, soaking his clothes. Whoever's turn it was to pump was covered in sweat. "No good! No good!" the workers shouted, and some went back to their own work. Only Xinzheng was left staring at the air hose. Finally, he transformed it, allowing the air to be pumped in quickly. The cannon was successful. Comrade Xinzheng's drops of hard work were exchanged for a brilliant flower. This cannon was subdued and fired at the bandit army under the command of artillery officers at the front line before the new year.

    The warriors are all praising Xinzheng's success. But Comrade Xinzheng is not proud of his achievements. When others praise him for the merits of this creation, he often says with a smile: "This is all due to the help of the leaders and the joint efforts of the fellow workers. I have no merit."

　　大炮重新上了前线
  　记一个技术工人的创造
    李凯
    “这几门炮是解放军用血汗换来的，可恶的匪军把炮闩、零件都损坏了，为了保卫咱们幸福的生活，咱要用一切办法修好它！咱们要建立强大的炮兵兵团，你要知道军队需要它！……”军区修械厂刘所长，指着高大的炮身微笑着，对工人王心正这样说。
    炮是解放军在羊山歼敌时缴获的，因为没有炮闩不能用，才从前线运回来。当着这高大的怪物和厂里的同志们见面时，只剩下一个直的筒子，好象一个动物被挖去了五脏一样。大家看了都吐出了舌头：“别说修理，连见过咱也没见过呀！”“咱这笨手笨脚的，硬想叫修理洋货，谁能修呀？”工人们你一言我一语的议论着，就连修理枪械最有经验的刘所长也有些踌躇起来。经过他一番的考虑之后，决定把这一任务分配给王心正同志来完成。
    当着心正听到刘所长对他讲了这席话后，不知怎的心里跳动起来，头上象是压上一块石头，这样大的任务他是不敢接受的。刘所长向他进行了几次动员，并告诉他尽管大胆的创造，心正才答应了：“试试看吧！”
    接受任务后的几天中，心正同志心里总是不安，晚上反来复去的睡不着，一闭上眼睛，高大的炮身便隐约的出现在面前，一会又看见炮轮，一会又看见所长和他谈话……，这些，一幕一幕的在他脑海里反复旋转着。“咱虽然学过修械，画过粗笨的图样，那只是小炮机枪上的小东西，配这样大炮上的炮闩，咱是不中的！”他把刚才已被动员起来的思潮，用力的按了一下，想到配炮闩的问题上。“我只是答应刘所长试一下，试不好就算了。在冀鲁豫还不是因为不会造，才送到这来的，这里造不好，还不是一样再送到别处去！”他继续这样想。“虽然学过修械……”他想到这里，不知怎的他想起了过去在旧工厂学修械时干活的惨境，他想到：过去在旧工厂整天都不得温饱，还被厂方当做奴隶。他又想到：被敌人驱逐着做工，狰狞的敌人让他没黑没白的干活，整天累的筋骨疼，还不发给工资，不够吃，更谈不到穿，整年象叫花子，一家人饿得痛哭流啼……，他险些儿流出眼泪。一闪间，光明幸福的生活又出现在他眼前。自从被解放后，领导上及工人弟兄们对自己是这样的体贴关怀，一月四百多斤米，自己有吃穿还能养家人，还被提拔成班长……，“这是天堂，那是地狱！”他不由的失声嚷叫出来，把同志们惊醒。“解放军需要它，我就一定造好它。”为了保护这天堂的生活，他下了这样的决心。于是，在那酷日当空的暑天，王心正同志牲牺了午觉，精心的制图案，他头上出了满头大汗也顾不得揩抹。在蚊子那样作怪刺人的深夜，他在他那设备简单的屋子里，闪闪的棉油灯下，在设计，又慌忙的抽出时间指点着工人们制造。在此期间，他饮食少进好多，面容显得憔悴了。刘所长怕他累病了，让他休息，他拒绝了。“解放军需要它呀！”他经常这样说着。当着每一个机件制出时，他那面容上便堆满了愉快。复杂的机件凑成的炮闩，在他的设计下，在工人们的精心制造下，毕竟完成了。这时心正同志才松快的吐出了一口气。
    当着开始试炮的时候，人们都怀着好奇的心情，来注视着他最后的成功，但是炮弹响过第一声后，就再不响了，放射不出去了。观众们摇摇头说：“咱说白费劲吧！”不知谁在取笑。心正同志抑止住烦恼，一点不灰心，仍镇静的探讨着，他终于找到这个原因：炮闩气积不够。“气小！再试试看！”他这样想着。十几个青年小伙子又围拢着打起气来，粗大的器管子使得工人们那么费力气，青年的工人班长光着膀子，头上的汗扑扑的落下来，衣服都湿透了。轮到谁打，谁就是一身汗。“不中！不中！”工人们嚷起来，有的又回去干自己的活。只剩下心正一人对着输气管凝视着，最后他终于改造了它，使气很快的打进去了，炮是成功了，心正同志滴滴的心血换来了灿烂的花朵，这门炮年前已驯服的在前线炮兵指挥下向匪军们发射了。
    勇士们都在颂扬着心正的成功。但是心正同志不以自己的功自豪，当别人称赞他这一创造的功绩时，他常笑着说：“这全是依靠领导上的帮助，和工人弟兄们的共同努力，我没有什么功劳。”
