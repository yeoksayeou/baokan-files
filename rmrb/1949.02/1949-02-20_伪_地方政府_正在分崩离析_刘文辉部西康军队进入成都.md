　　Pseudo "Local Government" is Falling Apart
  　Liu Wenhui's Xikang Troops Enter Chengdu
    Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, February 18th: The disintegration of the Kuomintang reactionary group is expanding from its "central" government to local governments. According to a Reuters dispatch from Nanjing on the 15th, "The Xikang army of Liu Wenhui, chairman of the Kuomintang Xikang Provincial Government, entered Chengdu today (the 15th), and the conflict between the hostile warlords of Sichuan and Xikang provinces quickly reached its climax." This news has been indirectly confirmed by a Central News Agency dispatch from Chengdu on the 15th. The dispatch stated that Zhang Qun flew from Chongqing to Chengdu on the 14th and visited Liu Wenhui, who had arrived in Chengdu, and Wang Lingji, chairman of the Kuomintang Sichuan Provincial Government, on the 15th, separately, and asked them to "unite". Traitor Zhang Qun was arranged by Chiang Kai-shek to go to Sichuan as the Chongqing Pacification Director before his "retirement," but has not yet formally taken office.

　　伪“地方政府”正在分崩离析
  　刘文辉部西康军队进入成都
    【新华社陕北十八日电】国民党反动集团的分崩离析正由它的“中央”政府扩展到地方政府。据路透社南京十五日电讯称：国民党西康省政府主席刘文辉的“西康军队今日（十五日）进入成都，川康两省敌对军阀间的纠纷迅即达于顶点”。此项消息已由国民党中央社成都十五日电所间接证实。该电称：张群十四日自重庆飞成都，十五日分别访问了到达成都的刘文辉与国民党四川省政府主席王陵基，并要求他们“团结”。张匪群是蒋匪介石在“引还”前安排到四川任重庆绥靖主任的，但至今尚未正式就职。
