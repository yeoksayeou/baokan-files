Women's Congress Dynamics

　　Wangdu Women's Congress Determines Policy
  　Mobilizing Women to Participate in Production
    The Wangdu County Women's Congress was held on January 20th. On the third day of the congress, five groups were divided according to district to discuss the guiding principles and tasks of women's work in 1949. Finally, the congress passed the following: (1) The guiding principle is to mobilize all women to actively participate in agricultural and sideline production, improve on the existing foundation, support the national liberation war, rectify women's organizations, strengthen education to raise awareness, and further advance the women's movement in the county. (2) Tasks: A. In terms of production, in agriculture, the old liberated areas should expand the production area, lead the production of widows and orphans, transform lazy women and exploiting landlord women, improve production technology, and organize wage labor and mutual assistance on the principle of equal value and voluntariness. In areas with a weak production base (Cheng Siguan), the main task is to carry out propaganda and education to make the majority of women overcome the old view that labor is shameful. In terms of sideline production, the focus of the textile industry should be on improving technology, improving tools, and organizing women. In Chengguan, more than 80% of the households should spin thread. B. Rectify women's organizations. In terms of ideological rectification, the main task is to strengthen the ideological education of women cadres, raise awareness, and strengthen the revolutionary outlook on life. In terms of organizational rectification, villages will be rectified differently depending on whether or not they have cadres active in them. C. In order to support the front lines, women must be mobilized to do logistical work (such as sewing, washing, and making shoes).

　　望都妇代确定方针
  　动员妇女参加生产
    望都县于一月二十日召开妇代大会。大会的第三天，以区为单位划分了五个小组，讨论一九四九年的妇女工作方针与任务。最后大会通过：（一）方针是：动员全体妇女积极参加农业副业生产，在旧有的基础上提高一步，支援全国解放战争，整顿妇女组织，加强教育提高觉悟，使全县妇女运动推进一步。（二）任务：甲、生产上，在农业方面，老区扩大生产面积，领导孤寡生产，改造懒婆和不劳而获的地主妇女，提高生产技术，在等价自愿的原则下组织拨工互助。生产基础较差的地区，（城四关），主要进行宣传教育，使广大妇女克服劳动为耻的旧观点。副业方面，纺织重点应放在提高技术，改良工具，组织起来。城关作到百分之八十以上的郡纺线。乙、整顿妇女组织在思想整理方面主要是加强妇女干部的思想教育，提高觉悟，坚定革命的人生观。在组织整理方面，分别有干部活动与无干部活动两种情况村庄进行整顿。丙、为支援前线，要动员起来作后勤工作（如缝洗作鞋）。
