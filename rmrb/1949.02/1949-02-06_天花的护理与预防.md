　　The Care and Prevention of Smallpox
　　Zhang Chenghua
　　"Smallpox" is a contagious disease that is most likely to occur in late winter and early spring. If one person gets the disease, it quickly spreads to others. If the people in one village get it, it quickly spreads to many villages. Many children have been killed by smallpox, or have been left with pockmarks all over their bodies, or have become idiots, blind, deaf, or mute.
　　Smallpox is transmitted either through direct contact with items used by smallpox patients, such as clothing, or through dust that carries the virus into other people's nasal cavities. The most infectious periods are when the patient is developing pustules and shedding scabs. After contracting smallpox, it doesn't immediately lead to illness; it takes eight to twelve days for the smallpox virus to grow in the body before symptoms appear. We can divide the symptoms of this disease into four stages:
　　The first stage is when the person with smallpox suddenly develops a headache, chills, and then a fever, nausea, vomiting, back pain, and general weakness. Sometimes they speak incoherently.
　　The second stage is the eruption stage. On the evening of the third day or early in the morning of the fourth day, red spots slowly appear on the skin. At this time, the person feels a bit better. The rash gradually increases, and the spots are painful when pressed. By the fifth or sixth day, these spots turn into white blisters with a depression in the center. On the eighth day, the blisters turn yellow and become red around the edges. The rash may be sparse or dense, varying from person to person. It first appears on the face and neck, then on the wrists, arms, and chest, and finally on the abdomen and legs.
　　The third stage is the pustule stage. The blisters all turn into pustules, which are yellow-green. The patient feels unwell again, with headaches and fever.
　　The fourth stage is the scab stage. Around the twelfth day, the pustules slowly dry up and form brown scabs. The fever subsides, and the person feels better. However, the most uncomfortable thing at this time is the itching. Gradually, the scabs fall off, and the person recovers. If the pustules do not dry up but turn into blood spots, or if several blood blisters merge together, it is usually a sign of death. There is no good way to quickly cure this disease once you get it. Therefore, it is best to prevent this disease from affecting us.
　　If someone has already contracted smallpox, we need to take good care of them to reduce the danger. The patient should lie down quietly in a darkened room, otherwise their eyes may be damaged. But there must be windows and doors for ventilation. They should eat thin, watery foods, drink plenty of boiled water, and gargle frequently (because there are also pox in the mouth). Use boric acid solution or salt water (a little salt in a bowl of boiled water) to wash their eyes often. If it itches, do not scratch it; you can take a bath or apply some oil to the skin to keep it clean. Most importantly, consult a doctor.
　　As for methods of preventing smallpox:
　　1. Vaccination: This is the best way. Whether male or female, adult or child, everyone must be vaccinated, at least once every five or six years. Babies can be vaccinated at three months old. During a smallpox epidemic, get vaccinated quickly!
　　2. If a smallpox patient is discovered, report it to the health authorities or village office quickly for prompt prevention and treatment, to prevent everyone from being infected.
　　3. If a smallpox patient is discovered, they should live in a separate room, and others should move away, leaving only an elderly person or someone who has already had smallpox to take care of them (they must cover their mouth and nose). Try to minimize contact with the patient (it is best not to approach them). No one else should use anything that the smallpox patient has used. Anyone who has come into contact with a smallpox patient or has used their belongings should be vaccinated within twenty-four hours.
　　4. All utensils and clothing used by smallpox patients should be frequently boiled in hot water or steamed in a steamer. After the smallpox patient recovers, all the eating utensils, washbasins, towels, socks, etc. that they have used must be completely boiled in hot water before others can use them. The house must also be disinfected and cleaned before others can live in it.
　　I would also like to explain that some villagers often use scabs from other people's smallpox sores for vaccination, which is very dangerous. If that child has infectious diseases such as tuberculosis or syphilis, taking their scab and vaccinating another child will also spread the tuberculosis or syphilis germs. As a result, after the child develops smallpox, they may develop incurable tuberculosis or syphilis for the rest of their life. If the vaccinated child is in poor health, they may even die during the vaccination process. Therefore, everyone should be universally vaccinated!

### 天花的护理与预防

　　天花的护理与预防
    张成华
    “天花”是一种传染病，在这冬末春初时最易发生，若是一个人得了这病，很快的就传染上别人，一个村子的人得了，很快的传染好多村。许多小孩都被天花害死，或是会闹得一身麻，也有变成了傻子、瞎子、聋子、哑巴的。
    天花的传染，一种是由于与害天花病人所用的东西、穿的衣服、直接接触；一种是由于尘埃飞扬，带到别人鼻腔里。染人最厉害的时期是在长脓泡和落痂皮的时候。染上了天花，并不是马上就要发病，一定要经过八天至十二天，天花病毒在人体内生长多了才能发现。这个病的症候我们可以把它分作四个时期来说：
    第一个时期，害天花的人忽然头痛起来，身上发冷以后，就发起烧来了，恶心，呕吐，腰疼，混身没劲，有时说糊话。
    第二个时期，就是发疹期。在第三天晚上或第四天早起，慢慢的在肉皮上长出红色的斑点。这个时候觉得身上轻快一点，疹子慢慢的多起来，用手压迫这疹子就觉得痛。赶到第五、六天后，这些疹子就变成白色水泡，水泡当中是凹的。第八天水泡就变成黄色，水泡的周围发红。疹子出来时，有的很稀，有的很密，不一样，是先从颜面头颈部出来，以后在手腕、胳膊、胸部出现，最后才出到腹部和腿上。
    第三个时期，就是化脓期，水泡都变成了脓泡，呈黄绿色，病人全身又不舒服，头疼身上发热。
    第四个时期，就是结痂期。在第十二天前后，脓泡就慢慢干了，结成了棕色的干痂，身上也不热，也觉得轻快啦！可是这时候最难受的是发痒，逐渐的痂皮脱落就好了。假若脓泡不干，而变成血斑，或几个血泡连在一系，那大都是死亡的前兆。得了这个病以后，是没有什么好办法可以把他很快治好的。所以我们最好是不要让这个病跑到我们身上来。
    如果已经得了天花，那就要我们照顾的好，危险才可以减少。对于这样的病人，要让他安静的躺着，住的屋子要暗一些，不然眼睛就会受伤。但一定要有门窗透气的地方。要吃些稀的饭食，多喝开水，常常嗽口（因口里也有痘疹），用硼酸水或盐水（一饭碗开水，放一点盐就行了）常常洗眼。发痒时千万不要用手去抓，可以洗洗澡或是在皮肤上搽点油，保持干净，最要紧的是要请医生看。
    至于预防天花的方法：
    一、种牛痘：这是最好的办法，不管是男是女，是大人幼童，都一定要种，最少五六年就得种一次，生下来的小孩满了三个月就可种，天花流行时，更得赶快种！
    二、发现出花的病人，要赶快报告卫生机关或村公所迅速预防治疗，免得大家受到传染。
    三、发现有天花病人，应当让他自己住一屋，别人搬开，只留一老年人或已出过天花的人照顾（要罩住口鼻），尽量少去人和他接近（最好不去接近他）。凡是天花病人用的东西，别人再不要用它。若是接触了天花病人或用过他的东西的人，应在二十四小时内赶快种痘。
    四、凡是天花病人的用具和衣物等，都要时常用开水煮或蒸笼蒸。等天花病人好了，他所用过的食具、脸盆、手巾、衣袜等，完全要用开水煮过别人才能用，房子也要经消毒扫除后，别人才能住。
    另外再说明一点，就是有的老乡常用别人的痘痂种痘，这危险性很大。因为这个孩子假若有结核、梅毒等传染病，取上他的痘痂，给另一个孩子种上，也就会将结核、梅毒的病菌相随种上，于是这小孩在发痘后，即会发生终身难治的结核、梅毒。倘种痘小孩的身体不好，在发痘当中还可能死亡。所以大家应普遍的种牛痘！
