[Jizhong Telegram] During the Lunar New Year, the people of Gu'an warmly comforted the People's Liberation Army. They voluntarily provided 1,137 jin of pork and 3,600,000 yuan, along with 493 comfort bags, as well as items like towels, eggs, peanuts, sugar, noodles, toothpaste, toothbrushes, and letters of appreciation, to comfort the front-line People's Liberation Army. On the evening of January 22nd, when the people of Gu'an heard that the People's Liberation Army was coming, every household boiled water and heated their kangs (sleeping platforms). Thousands of people and musical groups paraded through the villages, shouting slogans like "Welcome to the meritorious Northeast People's Liberation Army!" The sounds of slogans, gongs, drums, and wind instruments created a lively atmosphere. Elementary school students were divided into groups to visit the houses where each unit was staying and offered comfort: "Comrades, if you have any sewing or washing to be done, our children's corps will find someone to do it." Small flags with the words "This is prepared for the Northeast Army" were inserted into the haystacks. Among the various gifts sent to the troops, the comfort bags were the most outstanding, with various colorful words delicately embroidered with colorful threads, such as "Eat my peanuts, and Old Jiang won't know where the door is." "You fight bravely, and we actively support you." The Yanfangyuan Bathhouse in the city also voluntarily offered the army half-price discounts. Currently, the people of Gu'an are enthusiastically celebrating the liberation of Pingjin and the New Year, and even more enthusiastically comforting the Northeast People's Liberation Army.

　　固安人民春节劳军
    【冀中电】固安人民在旧历年节热烈慰劳解放军。自动以猪肉一千一百三十七斤，款三百六十万元，慰问袋四百九十三个，及毛巾、鸡子、花生、糖、挂面、牙粉、牙刷、慰问信等物品，慰劳前线解放军。一月二十二日晚上，固安人民听说解放军要来，家家户户烧开水腾热炕，成千群众和音乐会到各村游行，高呼：“欢迎劳苦功高的东北解放军！”口号声锣鼓笙笛热闹喧天。小学生分组到每个部队住的屋里慰问：“同志们有什么活缝缝洗洗的我们儿童团去给找人做。”柴草垛上插上小旗写的“这是给东北大军准备的。”送到部队的各样礼物中，慰问袋最出色，袋上用花线精绣着各样各色的字“吃了我的花生仁，打的老蒋摸不着门”。“你们英勇作战，我们积极支援”。城内燕芳园澡堂，也自动劳军减价一半。现固安人民正热烈的庆祝平津解放，庆祝新年，更热烈的慰劳东北解放军。
