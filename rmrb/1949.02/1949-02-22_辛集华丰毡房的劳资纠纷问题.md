　　The Labor-Management Dispute at Xinji Huafeng Felt Workshop
　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　Xing Jun
　　In January, workers at the Xinji Huafeng Felt Workshop filed a complaint with the trade union against the manager, Li Kaixun, for illegal acts infringing upon the interests of the workers, uncovering the inside story of the factory's labor-management dispute.

　　The Huafeng Felt Workshop was established last March with a small amount of capital of 7 million yuan (border currency - hereinafter the same) from Li Kaixun, Li Genfu, Wang Quanzi, Cao Wenjiang, and two others. Relying on investments from Yongji Leather Shop in Lixian County, Renhe Store in Shijiazhuang, Yuchang Goods Store and Qingfeng Grocery Store in this city, a total of 34 million yuan was raised in shares, and three workers were also brought in. Later, the scale expanded, the number of apprentices increased, and the number of employees reached 21. At that time, it was democratically agreed to implement a "four-six profit sharing system" based on a fixed wage. The specific regulations were: Manager Li Kaixun's monthly wage was 100 catties of rice, with a 1% share in the 40% profit, Li Genfu 100 catties, with a 0.9% share, Wang Quanzi, Cao Wenjiang, and Wang Huiying each received 120 catties per month, each with a 0.7% share. The workers who did not hold shares, such as Zhang Laoya and others, received monthly wages ranging from 100 to 160 catties of rice, depending on their skills. The nine apprentices each received a subsidy of 35 to 40 catties of millet per month. However, after one month of implementation, Li Kaixun fabricated the story that "the industry held a meeting and the trade union instructed that workers holding shares should not receive more than 100 catties of rice per month, and those not holding shares should not receive more than 160 catties." He also said, "We two are still earning 20 catties less than you, only 80 catties per month." In this way, he reduced the wages of Wang Quanzi and the other two by 20 catties each, while secretly maintaining his own at 100 catties. After another month, Li again said, "Business is good, our wages are too low." As a result, following his idea, the wages of all five people were increased to 130 catties, but in reality, he increased his own wage by 30 catties compared to the original, while the workers only increased by 10 catties. Especially when it came to settling accounts at the end of the year, he resorted to all sorts of tricks. This was manifested in: (1) Deducting workers' wages. For workers who did not hold shares, since most of them settled accounts at the end of the month, he used the excuse that the store had no money and converted the wages into deposits at the market price. As a result, when grain prices rose, they could not exchange for actual goods. According to calculations for Zhang Laoya alone for five months, he suffered a loss of 158 catties of rice. Regarding the treatment of apprentices, he arbitrarily changed it to 150,000 yuan of border currency per month, but in reality, it could not buy the amount of rice originally stipulated, thus profiting from it. (2) Underreporting industrial and commercial tax. When the government pre-collected industrial and commercial tax, Li reported a profit of 95 million, but the actual annual profit was 122 million. However, according to the shareholder's report, they paid 132 million yuan in income tax on profits, attempting to embezzle 3.7 million yuan of income tax that was underreported. (3) Unclear accounts. He wrote his own deposit of 11.37 million yuan as 12.065 million yuan, and discounted the inventory at one-quarter of the market price. All the furniture was not calculated at all, attempting to play tricks and take it for himself. Later, fearing that the workers would find out, he secretly paid out the shares of Wang Quanzi and Cao Wenjiang, and dismissed workers and shop assistants under the pretext that "they would not be working next year," leaving only eight apprentices who were related to him. At this point, the workers' anger became unbearable, and they exposed his exploitation. The cunning Li Kaixun, seeing that things were not going well, secretly gave money to Wang Huiying to buy pork to treat Wang Quanzi, in order to sow discord among the workers. But no one was fooled by him again. Later, with the assistance of the government and the trade union, a reasonable solution was reached.

　　Judging from the Huafeng Felt Workshop issue, their fundraising operation and democratically agreed wage standards and profit-sharing methods were in line with the principle of mutual benefit for labor and capital. This form is extremely common in Xinji. Among the 182 fur and leather businesses, 163 are of this type, and only 19 are purely wage-based. This stimulates production, facilitates the accumulation of capital, and expands operations, thus becoming the main key to the rapid recovery and development of industry and commerce in the city in recent years. However, in the process of development, there are still two noteworthy issues, namely, the phenomenon of some industrial and commercial households disregarding government laws and regulations and managers making arbitrary decisions in labor-management cooperation to deprive workers of their interests. The labor-management dispute at Huafeng Felt Workshop is just a typical example, and it is not limited to this. Not long ago, it was discovered that several industrial and commercial households, such as Dehua Copper Basin Factory and Yixing Leather Whip Shop, had engaged in "operating without application" and "trademark without registration," and exploiting workers through wage deductions. Recently, it was discovered that Yuanchang Copper Basin Factory used the excuse that the bank did not issue funds and that the store had no money to fail to pay wages on time, causing workers to suffer losses due to price fluctuations, while the manager increased his own expenses by a large amount. Gongxing Leather Factory, because of hatred for worker Dong Shunqi who reported wage issues to the trade union last year, groundlessly said that his skills were not good this year and dismissed Dong without cause. Tongfeng Towel Factory, due to the transfer of the inventory, discounted three complete sets of machines and a large wheel worth 10 million border currency to 3.5 million, and proposed to return them to the shareholder outside the city. When the worker Gao Sangang who held shares said to keep them, the manager said that a separate price had to be negotiated. As for the fact that accounts between shareholders are not public and workers are not allowed to understand business conditions, it is quite common. The formation of the above-mentioned phenomena is due to: (1) Most of the managers are former employees of old shops, and their ideas of speculation and opportunism are very strong. Although there is no longer the deceptive behavior of eating (shares) secretly without paying, their ruling ideology and trickery still exist. (2) After the industrial and commercial conference in March last year, the trade union leadership unilaterally emphasized that it was profitable for the capitalists regarding labor-management issues, and insufficient protection of the workers' vested interests - such as considering it reasonable to reduce wages behind their backs - which fueled the arrogance of managers to exploit workers. (3) There is insufficient education for workers, and some dare not speak out even if they have clearly suffered losses, fearing that they will lose their jobs. Although these shortcomings are constantly being overcome, it is very slow, and we must continue to strengthen regular education and properly handle labor-management disputes to raise workers' awareness, supervise managers, and safeguard the rights that workers should enjoy.

　　辛集华丰毡房的劳资纠纷问题
    行军
    一月间，辛集华丰毡坊工人向职工会控告了经理李开勋侵犯工人利益的违法行为，揭开了该厂劳资纠纷的内幕。
    华丰毡坊是去年三月以李开勋、李根甫、王全子、曹文江等五人的小部资金共七百万元（边币——下同）作基础，依靠蠡县永记皮庄、石家庄仁和商店、本市玉昌货栈、庆丰杂货庄的投资，共集股三十四万元，又找来三个工人所组成。后来规模扩大，学徒增多，员工共达二十一人。当时民主议定，实行一定工资作基础的东伙四六分红制，具体规定：经理李开勋每月工资米一百斤，在其四成红利中吃股一分，李根甫一百斤，吃股九厘，王全子、曹文江、王惠英每人每月一百廿斤，各吃股七厘。不吃股的工人张老雅等七人，按照技术，每月工资米一百和一百六十斤不等。学员九人，每月各补助小米卅五斤至四十斤。但执行了一个月，李开勋便捏造说：“行业里开会，工会指示吃股工人每月不超过工资米一百斤，不吃股的最多不超过一百六十斤。”并说：“俺俩还是比你们少挣二十斤，每月八十斤。”这样就把王全子等三人的工资，每人减少了二十斤，自己却暗里仍保持一百斤。又经过一个月，李又说：“买卖不错，咱们的工资太小。”结果依从他的主意，五个人都增到一百三十斤，实际上他较原来工资增加三十斤，工人仅增加了十斤。特别是临年结帐，诡计百出。这表现在：（一）克扣工人工资。对不吃股的工人，因多是月终结帐，借口柜上没钱，即将工资按市价折合存款，故粮价上涨，换不回实物，只张老雅一人五个月的计算，即吃一百五十八斤米的亏；对学员待遇，擅自改为每月边币十五万元发给，事实买不到过去规定的米数，从中渔利。（二）隐报工商税。此次政府预征工商税，李报盈利九千五百万，实际全年盈利是一亿二千二百万，但经东家报帐，则又说缴了一亿三千二百万元的盈利所得税，企图私吞少报三千七百万元的所得税。（三）帐目不清。把自己存款一千一百卅七万元，写成一千二百万零六千五百元，并将存货低于市价四分之一折款，一切家具根本没计算在内，企图从中捣鬼，归为己有。后怕工人发觉，又偷偷将王全子、曹文江的股金批出，并借口“明年不干了”来开除工人伙计，只留下和他有亲戚关系的八个学员。至此，工人愤怒已无可忍受，才揭发了他的剥削行为。狡猾的李开勋见事不好，便分别暗里给钱叫王惠英拿猪肉请王全子吃，以此来挑拨工人间的团结。但谁也没有再上他的当。后经政府、工会协助，得以合理解决。
    从华丰毡坊问题来看，他们集资经营，民主规定的工资标准和分红办法，是符合劳资两利原则的。此种形式，在辛集极为普遍，仅皮毛业一百八十二家中，就有一百六十三户，纯工资制的不过十九家。这样会刺激生产，便于积累资本，扩大经营，因此成为该市几年来工商业迅速恢复发展的主要关键。但在发展过程中，还存在着两个值得注意的问题，即工商户中渺视政府法令和劳资合作中经理独断专行剥夺工人利益的现象。象华丰毡坊的劳资纠纷只不过是一个典型例子，其实并不止于此。年前不久曾发现德华铜盆厂、义兴皮鞭铺等若干工商户“营业不申请”，“商标不注册”，和从工资折款中剥削工人的事实。近来又发现源昌铜盆厂，借口银行不发款说柜上没钱，不按时支付工资，因物价波动使工人吃亏，相反经理却涨支许多。公兴皮厂，因仇恨工人董顺起年前向工会反映工资问题，今年误说其技术不好，而无故将董开革下来。同丰毛巾工厂，因转业盘货将价值一千万边币的三张全套机子和一个大轮，折为三百五十万，并主张归市外的财东，入股的工人高三刚说留下，经理便说那得另合价。至于东伙之间帐目不公开，不叫工人了解业务情况等则相当普遍。上述现象的形成，是由于：（一）经理多为过去的旧商铺职员，投机取巧的思想很浓厚，目前虽没有了对工人明吃（股）暗不吃的欺骗行为，但其统治思想与捣鬼欺骗现象仍然存在。（二）去年三月工商会议后，工会领导上曾对劳资问题，片面强调资方有利可图，对工人既得利益的维护不足——如对背月减低工资认为是合理的——助长了经理剥削工人的气焰。（三）对工人的教育不够，有些明明吃了亏还不敢说，怕砸了饭碗。这些缺点虽在不断的克服，但很迟缓，必须继续从加强经常教育和正确处理劳资纠纷中，提高工人觉悟，监督经理，维护工人应享的权利。
