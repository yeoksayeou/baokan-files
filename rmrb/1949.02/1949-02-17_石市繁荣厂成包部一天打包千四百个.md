Worker Life

　　The packaging work in the Packaging Department of Shijiazhuang Prosperity Factory: In order to completely package all the stored yarn before the Lunar New Year, everyone started a rush. Minister Xia of the Works Department said, "You packed 800 small bundles last time and it was reported in the newspaper. If you can pack 1,000 small bundles, you will be commended again!" This call to action boosted the workers' enthusiasm. Everyone agreed to work hard without slacking off. Small bundle car worker Li Fujuan said to Cheng Peiqing, "Dare you take off your shirt?" Cheng Peiqing said, "Why wouldn't I dare? If you dare, I dare!" After saying that, the two of them took off their cotton-padded jackets and started working bare-chested (the factory has heating equipment). Seeing them working so hard, Yin Tonghua loudly said, "Let's all take off our clothes and work!" Before he finished speaking, everyone took off their cotton clothes and started working. So, the small bundle car workers urged the yarn pullers, and the yarn pullers urged the small bundle car workers, one urging the other. If you do it fast, I'll do it even faster. Xu Hun, who was packing large bundles, led three apprentice workers to pack large bundles, and said: We will help you pull yarn and pack small bundles when we are done with the large bundles. Liu Xichang and Cao Xianzeng, who weighed the yarn, said, "As long as you can pull out the yarn, I guarantee to weigh it well for you! We can't waste time!" As a result, according to the statistics for January 26th alone, 205 large bundles and 1,240 small bundles were packed. The individual record for small bundle car worker Yin Tonghua was 222 small bundles, and yarn puller Li Laolei copied 358 yarns. (Yuan)
