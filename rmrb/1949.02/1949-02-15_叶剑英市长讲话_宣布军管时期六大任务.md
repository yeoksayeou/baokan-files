Xinhua News Agency, Beiping, 13th. Mayor Ye Jianying's speech at the Beiping All-Circles Celebration of Liberation Conference is as follows:

　　Comrades of the People's Liberation Army, workers of Beiping, students, all working people and all citizens of Beiping: Let us celebrate the great victory of the people of Beiping in the free sky and in the free city. The people of Beiping not only gained true freedom and democracy for the first time, but also the peaceful resolution of Beiping created a new model for the cause of the Chinese people's liberation. This is inseparable from the correct leadership of the Chinese Communist Party, the strategic genius of the people's leader Mao Zedong, and the heroic and skillful fighting of the People's Liberation Army. Comrades! We should shout: "Long live the Chinese Communist Party!" "Long live the people's leader Chairman Mao!" "Long live the victory of the People's Liberation Army!"

　　Comrades! Although the enemy has suffered a fatal blow from the people's power, the enemy has not yet finally died. Under the direction of American imperialism, the enemy is still using various deceptive methods, that is, using the method of disguised peace, in an attempt to linger and make a final struggle and resistance. We must thoroughly expose and thoroughly defeat this attempt.

　　We are people who strive for true freedom, democracy, and peace for the Chinese people and the people of the world. What we demand is true peace, not false peace, lasting peace, not temporary peace. To achieve this goal, it can only be achieved in accordance with Chairman Mao's eight peace conditions. I hope everyone will recognize and be vigilant.

　　Chinese Communist Party members in Beiping: As well as the Beiping Military Control Commission and the Beiping Municipal People's Government, the central tasks during the military control period are:

　　(1) To completely eliminate all remaining counter-revolutionary forces lurking in Beiping that continue to carry out armed sabotage.

　　(2) To assist the people of Beiping to organize and systematically establish the people's revolutionary regime, and to implement the New Democratic policies.

　　(3) To take over all public organs, industries and materials, and to control them.

　　(4) To eliminate all chaos and establish a regular order of people's democracy.

　　(5) To disband the organizations of the Kuomintang, the Sanmin Zhuyi Youth League, the National Party, the Youth Party, and all reactionary parties and groups under the Nanjing government system in Beiping.

　　(6) To arrest war criminals and heinous reactionaries who should be arrested.

　　Comrades: Our Beiping Municipal Committee of the Chinese Communist Party, the Military Control Commission, and the Municipal People's Government, under the leadership of the Pingjin Front Committee of the Chinese Communist Party and under the supervision and assistance of the people, will resolutely fight to complete the above tasks. Long live the liberation of the people of Beiping! Long live the liberation of the Chinese people!

  　宣布军管时期六大任务
    【新华社北平十三日电】北平市长叶剑英将军在北平各界庆祝解放大会上的讲话，全文如下：
    人民解放军武装同志们，北平市工友们，同学们，一切劳动人民和全北平市的市民们：让我们在自由的天空，自由的城市里边，来庆祝北平人民自己的伟大的胜利。北平人民不仅仅是第一次获得真正的自由和民主，而且北平的和平解决，又为中国人民解放事业创造了新的榜样。这是与中国共产党正确的领导，人民领袖毛泽东的战略天才以及人民解放军的英勇善战不可分离的。同胞们！我们应该高呼：“中国共产党万岁！”“人民领袖毛主席万岁！”“人民解放军胜利万岁！”
    同胞们！敌人虽然受了人民力量致命的打击，但是敌人还没有最后的死亡，敌人还在美帝国主义导演下用各种欺骗的方法，即用伪装和平的方法，企图苟延残喘，作最后的挣扎和顽抗，这种企图我们必须加以彻底的揭穿和彻底的击破。
    我们是为中国人民，为世界人民求得真正的自由、民主与和平而奋斗的人们，我们所要求的是真和平，不是假和平，是持久的和平，不是暂时的和平，要达到这目的，只有按照毛主席八条和平条件才能获得，希望大家要认识和警惕。
    北平市的中国共产党员们：以及北平军事管制委员会和北平市人民政府，在军事管制时期的中心任务是：
    （一）要完全肃清一切潜伏在北平市的继续进行武装破坏的残余反革命势力。
    （二）要协助北平的人民群众组织起来并系统地建立人民的革命政权，推行新民主主义的政策。
    （三）接收一切公共机关、产业和物资，并加以管制。
    （四）消灭一切混乱现象，建立人民民主的经常的秩序。
    （五）解散国民党、三青团、民族党、青年党及南京政府系统下一切反动党派和团体在北平的组织。
    （六）逮捕应该逮捕的战犯及罪大恶极的反动分子。
    同胞们：我们中国共产党北平市委、军事管制委员会和北平人民政府，在中国共产党平津前线总前委领导下，在人民监督和协助之下，坚决地为完成上述任务而斗争。北平人民解放万岁！中国人民解放万岁！
