　　Several Issues to Note When Issuing Land Certificates
    Taihang Second Prefectural Committee Office

Based on the experiences of various regions, issuing land certificates and measuring land is indeed a rather complex task, and also an important part of the overall conclusion of the land reform. It is necessary to organize and lead the work, combining it with resolving many historical issues among the peasants, consolidating unity among the peasants, earnestly implementing the work, and through this specific work, further elevate the masses. The following are some experiences compiled from materials from various regions for reference:

    (1) It is imperative to thoroughly implement the publicity and education of issuing land certificates, so that the masses truly understand the purpose and significance of issuing land certificates and further enhance the production enthusiasm of the masses. It should be recognized that issuing land certificates is an important process for continuing to implement ideological education and mobilize the masses. The process should not be viewed as merely handling formalities from a task-oriented perspective. The experience of various regions is that in the process of issuing land certificates, in-depth publicity and education should be carried out simultaneously, explaining that the issuance of land certificates is to completely abolish the feudal and semi-feudal land ownership system, establish the land ownership rights of farmers, and finally consolidate the achievements of land reform. It is necessary to explain to the peasants that issuing land certificates is neither a replacement of contracts nor a temporary measure. Combine this with explaining our party's land policy after the end of the land reform and the production policy of rewarding those who organize and become rich, and on this basis, inspire the masses' awareness and sense of responsibility for issuing land certificates and measuring land. This will enable the broad masses to care about and actively participate in this work.

    (2) Organizing and leading the filling out of land certificates and the measurement of land is an extremely important task in the entire concluding land reform movement, and it is also a major event that the broad masses are most concerned about and urgently demand. Some counties and districts do not pay attention to issuing land certificates even after the movement is over or about to end, which is a disconnect from the masses and absolutely unacceptable. According to the experience of various regions, the general practice is that after the implementation of the land reform plan, in conjunction with the summary and inspection of the movement, the People's Congress entrusts the village government to absorb experienced farmers and literate and numerate people in the village. Under the unified leadership of the village government, according to the respective expertise and nature of the work, "registration and filling," "evaluation and measurement," and "dispute mediation" groups are organized, with one leader per group and several other assistants assigned according to the workload. These groups prepare for the issuance of land certificates by carrying out the work of filling, measuring, evaluating, and mediating. In the specific process, a combination of individual self-reporting, mass exposure, and registration investigation is adopted. On the basis of the masses' ideological awareness, self-reporting and mutual exposure are encouraged. The registration group drafts a preliminary land certificate. If inaccuracies are found, they are reported to the measurement group for re-measurement. At the same time, the mediation group, based on the principle of unity and production, mediates disputes based on the requests of the masses and their own inspections, resolving all historical issues. Finally, after correcting inaccurate land acreage and resolving disputes, the draft of the land certificate is announced to the masses for approval, and then the land certificate is officially filled out and issued, and the official conclusion of the land reform is announced. This approach not only cultivates the ability of village cadres and the masses to handle affairs and be autonomous, but also smoothly completes the concluding land reform, stabilizes the mood of the peasants, and greatly enhances their enthusiasm for production, fully turning to the road of unity and production.

    (3) Conscientiously investigate and research, combine with inspiring the masses' awareness, check the thoroughness of land concealment, and correct the burden. Recently, in the process of issuing land certificates and measuring land in various regions, it has been found that some party branches and masses collectively and for a long time conceal large amounts of land without informing the higher authorities. This should be given serious attention and carefully inspected, and the masses should be mobilized and educated to self-report publicly and seek a solution on the basis of awareness. Therefore, the issuance of land certificates must be combined with resolving the above specific problems, further educating the masses to realize that doing so not only deceives the government, but also makes the burden in the village more unfair, actually causing everyone to suffer losses. In terms of methods: on the one hand, conduct investigations and visits to understand the actual amount of land, and conduct individual education based on the problems discovered during the visits. More importantly, conduct education on "final determination of ownership" and development of production and current affairs inside and outside the party to inspire awareness, call on the masses to self-report land, and announce that past offenses will not be investigated, but repeated offenses will be pursued. In this way, in order to establish land ownership and adjust the burden to be fair and reasonable, coupled with inspiring awareness, the masses will report the concealed land. Liu Jiazhuang in Zuoquan used this method to mobilize the reporting of more than 900 mu of land collectively concealed by cadres and the masses, and educated the masses to recognize the error of this behavior and the losses they had suffered over the years.

    (4) Thoroughly resolve historical issues among peasants under the principle of unity and production. Due to the changes in land and housing property in recent years, there are indeed some land disputes and historical issues among peasants, such as the determination of the quantity of land and housing allocated during the land reform, the division of land boundaries, and issues such as lease, mortgage, and redemption. These issues must be resolved in the concluding land reform to completely abolish the feudal and semi-feudal land system. At the same time, the masses also urgently demand resolution. Failure to resolve these issues will affect production and the unity among the peasants, and even prevent the filling out of land certificates. Therefore, in the process of issuing land certificates, the principle of unity and production must be grasped, and the method of mediation must be adopted to thoroughly resolve these issues. For example, Yushe resolved the above problems in this way, based on the spirit of unity and mutual care, and under unified leadership. However, it does not excessively emphasize solving each problem one by one based on old habits and old procedures, nor does it solve them in isolation from the entire concluding land reform, in order to prevent entanglement in some specific problems from affecting the development of the movement, or even affecting the unity of the masses. Heshun combines the draft registration of land certificates, and whenever problems are discovered, the mediation group conducts mediation. When the mediation group cannot resolve larger problems, they are submitted to the People's Congress for resolution. Experience proves that those who proceed according to the above spirit and practices not only easily solve problems, but also further promote unity among the peasants. Conversely, it will inevitably become entangled in some specific problems, forming lawsuits, preventing problems from being resolved, and affecting the development of the movement.

　　发土地证应注意的几个问题
    太行二地委办公室
    根据各地经验，颁发土地证及丈量土地，确实是相当复杂的一件工作，也是整个结束土改中一个重要部分，必须有组织有领导的结合解决农民间许多历史遗留问题，巩固农民间的团结，认真贯彻执行，并通过这一具体工作，把群众继续提高一步。兹就各地材料，整理出以下几点经验，供作参考：
    （一）必须深入贯彻颁发土地证的宣传教育，使群众真正了解颁发土地证的目的意义，把群众生产情绪更提高一步。应认识发土地证是继续贯彻群众的思想教育思想发动的重要过程，不能以任务观点单纯办理手续，各地经验是在发土地证过程中，同时深入宣传教育，说明土地证的颁发是彻底废除封建半封建土地所有制，确立农民土地所有权最后巩固土地改革成果。必须给农民说明发土地证，既不是换契，又不是一时一样。结合并讲明土改结束后我党的土地政策及奖励组织起来发家致富的生产政策，在此基础上启发群众对颁发土地证及丈量土地的自觉性与责任心。从而使广大群众关心和积极参加这一工作。
    （二）有组织有领导的填发土地证和丈量土地，这是整个结束土改运动中一项极重要的工作，也是广大群众最关心和最迫切要求的一件大事。有些县区在运动结束或将要结束也不注意发土地证，是脱离群众的，绝不允许有任何忽视。根据各地经验一般的做法是结束土改方案实施后，结合运动的总结检查，由人代会委托村政府吸收村中有经验的农民及会写会算的群众，在村政府统一领导上，按各个人的特长和工作性质，分别组织“登记填写”“评议丈量”“调解纠纷”等小组，每组设组长一人按工作的繁重程度，分配其它助手若干人，进行填发丈评调解工作准备颁发土地证，在具体进行中采取个人自报，群众检举，登记调查三者相结合的方法。在群众思想自觉基础上，发动自报，互相检举，结合登记组初步登记土地证的草稿，如发现不确，即报告丈量组，重新丈量，与此同时调解组在团结生产的原则下根据群众的请求和自己的检查进行调解纠纷，解决一切历史遗留问题，最后经过不确地亩的订正，纠纷问题的解决，土地证草底向群众公布通过后正式填写与颁发土地证并宣布土改正式结束。这样结果不但培养了村干与群众的办事和自主能力，而且也顺利的最后完成了结束土改。稳定了农民情绪，大大提高了农民生产积极性，全力转向团结生产道路。
    （三）认真调查研究，结合启发群众自觉，检查土地隐瞒彻底订正负担。最近各地在颁发土地证及丈量土地中，发现有的支部群众集体的长期大量的隐瞒土地，不让上级知道，应引起严重注意，认真检查，并发动与教育群众在自觉基础上，自报公众求得解决。因此在发土地证中必须结合解决上述具体问题，进一步教育群众认识这样做不但欺骗了政府，而使村里负担更加不公道，实际上大家吃亏。方法上：一方面进行调查访问、了解土地确实程度，从访问中发现问题进行个别教育。更重要的是党内外进行“最后确定所有权”及发展生产和时事等教育，启发自觉，号召群众自报土地，并宣布不究过去，再犯必追。这样群众为了确立土地所有权，调整负担公道合理，再加上启发觉悟，群众是会报出隐瞒土地来的。左权刘家庄就是这样办法将干部群众集体隐瞒的九百余亩土地，动员报出来的，并教育了群众认识了这种行为的错误，和几年来吃的亏。
    （四）在团结生产的原则下彻底解决农民间历史遗留问题，由于几年来的土地房产变动，农民间确实存在着若干土地纠纷和历史遗留问题，如土改中分配房地的数量确定，地界的划分以及租佃典当等问题，在结束土改中必须加以解决，彻底废除封建半封建的土地制度。同时群众也迫切要求解决，不解决就会影响生产和农民间的团结，甚至无人填发土地证。因此必须在发土地证过程中，掌握团结生产的原则，采取调解方法彻底加以解决，如榆社在这次解决上述问题，是本着团结的精神互相照顾进行调解，在统一领导下加以解决，但不过分强调一个一个依据旧的习惯和旧的手续硬加解决，更不是脱离开整个结束土改孤立的进行解决，以防止纠缠在一些具体问题上影响运动发展，甚至影响群众团结。和顺是结合登记土地证草稿，随时发现，随时由调解组进行调解，较大问题调解组不得解决时，提交人代会进行解决，经验证明，凡本上述精神与做法进行的，不但问题容易解决，而且更加促进了农民间的团结。反之就必然纠缠在一些具体问题上，形成了打官司，问题不得解决，响影运动的发展。
