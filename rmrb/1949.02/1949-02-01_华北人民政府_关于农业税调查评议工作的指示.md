North China People's Government
Instructions on Agricultural Tax Investigation and Evaluation

In order to adapt to the rural economic situation after land reform and develop agricultural production, this government officially promulgated the "Provisional Agricultural Tax Regulations for the North China Region" on December 25th of last year. Various administrative offices have initially implemented it; however, due to the urgency of time and the imminent autumn tax collection, land yields in many areas have not been surveyed and assessed, resulting in extremely unbalanced yield determinations. In some areas, the acreage is also inaccurate (especially in newly liberated areas). Coupled with our inaccurate assessment of the harvest situation, there have been phenomena of excessively light or heavy burdens, affecting the lives and productive enthusiasm of the masses. Therefore, balancing agricultural tax yields and investigating land acreage is not only necessary for the thorough implementation of the new agricultural tax regulations and the smooth development of the large-scale production movement, but has also become an urgent demand of the broad masses of farmers. Some administrative offices have also made similar suggestions. Therefore, this government has decided to make this work the central task of the government from January to March this year. We hope that leaders at all levels will attach sufficient importance to it ideologically, devote major efforts, and conduct this work in a planned and step-by-step manner.

Due to the different work foundations and war situations in various places, this year, we require that Ji-Lu-Yu and Ji'nan generally evaluate yields and clarify land acreage. Other administrative offices should make appropriate adjustments in old liberated areas with better yield evaluations and true acreage, aligning with reality. In newly liberated areas and some semi-old liberated areas with weaker foundations, we should conduct as comprehensive an investigation and evaluation as possible, with the newly liberated areas as the focus of the entire work. This year, we should strive to ensure that approximately one-fifth of the counties in the entire North China region (approximately one-half in Taiyue, approximately one-third in Beiyue and Taihang, approximately one-quarter in Jizhong, all of Shijiazhuang, part of Yangquan, approximately six or seven counties in Ji-Lu-Yu and Ji'nan, and three or four counties in Jinzhong) can achieve true and balanced yields and accurate acreage, and on this basis, fix the yields and burdens. Each region can formulate specific plans based on time and resources, centering around the large-scale production movement, and strive to distribute them to villages before February 15th, and generally complete them before spring plowing. In some areas where support-the-front work is busy, applications may be submitted to this government for approval to postpone appropriately.

Regarding the methods and steps for carrying out this work, the following instructions are given:

(1) Make full preparations, convene good cadre meetings, and strive to inspect several typical villages before the meeting for research and reference, so as to carry out the work under unified understanding and unified standards (the yield determination standards promulgated by this government) – the administrative offices shall convene meetings of commissioners, county heads, and heads of finance sections of special districts before the end of January, and each county shall complete meetings of district and village cadres before February 15th. At the meeting:

    A. All cadres attending the meeting should truly recognize the basic spirit of the new tax regulations to develop production and ensure supply, as well as the importance of this work. They should recognize the true situation of whether the yield evaluation in their locality is high or low, seek truth from facts, follow the mass line, and overcome any possible selfishness, localism, empiricism, subjectivism, and tailism.

    B. Study the agricultural tax regulations carefully, especially the yield determination standards promulgated by this government, and unify them. If there are any opinions, they can be submitted to this government in advance as much as possible, but they must not be modified without authorization.

    C. Initially analyze the figures of various places, carefully and repeatedly comparing the average land per person, the average yield per mu, the average yield per person, and the proportion of other income (fruits, etc.) in different economic zones (especially focusing on the comparison of figures in bordering areas), and combine typical materials for research and analysis, thereby putting forward realistic work plans and work requirements, in order to achieve true, balanced, and fixed yields.

    D. Introduce and summarize good and bad typical materials in the yield evaluation of previous years in this area, and exchange experiences.

    E. During the meeting and work, some farmer representatives or impartial old farmers can be invited to participate, and counties with sound people's representative assemblies should jointly preside over the meeting with the people's representative assembly.

(2) Grasp the yield of bordering areas and standard land, grasp the figures of various places, and check and correct them in a timely manner. – In order to balance the yields between various regions, the method of joint surveying and determination of bordering areas should be adopted at each level. For the bordering areas of each administrative office, the administrative office shall send cadres to the location designated by this government (another notification) before February 10th, and conduct joint surveying and determination with cadres from the local and neighboring districts under the leadership of personnel sent by this government. The bordering areas of each special district shall be jointly surveyed and determined by neighboring special districts under the leadership of the administrative office, and the same applies to counties and districts. Each village should jointly form a "Joint Survey Committee" to overcome village-level egoism. To prevent inter-village egoism, one can start with standard land in bordering areas (several pieces of standard land can be specified) and extend it to the inland. To prevent isolating the standard land, the figures of various places (especially the average yield per mu) should be grasped in a timely manner to review and compare it with the standard land yield as a reference scale, and compare it with the figures of previous years to investigate the specific reasons for the increase or decrease. When the initial stage of the key villages in the bordering area comes to an end (approximately ten days to half a month after the start of work), the county should convene an inspection meeting once to disseminate experience and correct deviations, and then fully expand the work. Last year, Beiyue and Jizhong selected impartial old farmers familiar with the situation to combine with district and village cadres and conduct mobile surveys in nearby villages, which was very effective and can be used as a reference for various places. For counties that strive to fix yields and burdens this year, the administrative office must send cadres or entrust the special district to send cadres to the county to assist and inspect.

(3) The key to doing this work well lies in leadership. – To achieve the above requirements, there must be a strong leadership core. There must be unity of strength and coordination of steps in all aspects. To this end, the administrative office, special district, and county levels should be composed of five to seven people, including administrative heads, people's representative assemblies (counties with people's representative assemblies), peasant associations, finance departments, and other relevant departments, to form an "Agricultural Tax Investigation and Evaluation Committee," with the administrative head serving as the director. The committee should be truly responsible for resolving the contradictions between tasks and resources and time, and resolving the integration with the end of land reform and party rectification, preparing for production, and supporting the front and expanding the army. The "Investigation and Evaluation Committee" has no hierarchical relationship. Its decisions are issued through various organizational systems.

(4) Several issues in the implementation of the regulations on the determination of agricultural tax land acreage and normal yield issued by this government in October last year:

    1. The style of the construction ruler attached is only for the use of governments above the county level to compare and convert land acreage.

    2. Section 4 of Article 2, Paragraph 3, "Local conditions, such as dense population and narrow land, intensive cultivation and meticulous work, or sparse population and extensive cultivation, should be distinguished according to the actual situation," is changed to "Local conditions, that is, the general labor, fertilizer, cultivation technology, and other conditions in the area."

    3. The last sentence of Article 2, Paragraph 3, "Generally speaking, a six to eight-year harvest can be called normal" is deleted.

    4. The conversion rate of various grains in yield evaluation will be notified separately by this government.

(5) Any opinions reflected in the implementation of the new tax regulations and yield evaluation standards should be collected and reported to this government in a timely manner for future research and revision. In the later stage of yield evaluation, the acreage and harvest situation of wheat fields should also be investigated (included in the report and summary) for summer tax collection reference.

(6) Strictly implement the reporting and summary system:

    A. Commissioners and county heads every half month.

    B. All counties that strive to achieve true yields, balanced burdens, and fixed this year must report directly to this government in addition to reporting to the special district and administrative office.

    C. Each administrative office should also select two to four counties of different types in the newly liberated area to report directly to this government.

    D. The work summary should be generally made in late April. This government will convene a meeting of administrative chiefs of the finance departments of various administrative offices at the end of April. All localities should bring their opinions on this year's summer tax collection and agricultural tax investigation and evaluation and summary (especially the figures of each county).

(7) Investigation expenses: The cost of printing registers shall be paid under the item of financial expenses, and each administrative office shall stipulate and control it under the principle of frugality. All other expenses (such as hiring impartial old farmers, meals for assisting personnel when leaving the village, and pen, ink, oil, and charcoal) shall be paid from local grain funds, and extravagance and waste are strictly prohibited.

　　华北人民政府
    关于农业税调查评议工作的指示
    为适应土地改革后农村经济情况，发展农业生产，本府曾于去年十二月二十五日正式颁布华北区农业税暂行税则，各行署业经初步执行；但由于时间仓促，秋征在即，所以在许多地区土地产量未加勘查评定，产量订定极不平衡，某些地区亩数也不确实（尤其是新区）；加上我们对年景调查不确，在负担上发生畸轻畸重现象，影响群众生活和生产情绪。故平衡农业税产量，调查土地亩数，不仅为贯彻执行新农业税则，顺利开展大生产运动所必需，而且成为广大农民迫切要求，有些行署也有同样建议。因此，本府决定将这一工作，作为今年政府一至三月份中心工作，并望各级领导在思想上应有足够的重视，拿出主要力量，有计划有步骤地去进行这一工作。
    由于各地工作基础及战争情况之不同，今年要求冀鲁豫、冀南普遍评定产量，澄清土地亩数。其他各行署则在评产较好地亩真实的老区，进行适当调整，向真实看齐。在基础较差的新区及某些半老区，则应尽可能普遍调查评议，并以新区为整个工作重点。今年要争取全华北约有五分之一的县（太岳二分之一左右，北岳、太行三分之一左右，冀中四分之一左右，石家庄全部，阳泉一部，冀鲁豫、冀南约六七个县，晋中三、四个县）能达到产量真实平衡地亩确实，并在此基础上把产量与负担固定起来。各地区可根据时间、力量，围绕大生产运动，提出具体计划，尽可能于二月十五日前布置到村，在春耕农忙前大体完成。在某些地区如支前工作烦忙，可报请本府批准，适当延缓。
    关于这一工作之进行方法和步骤，兹再作如下指示：
    （一）充分准备，开好干部会议，争取在会前检查几个典型村，供会议研究参考，以便在统一认识，统一标准（本府颁布之订产标准）下展开工作——行署于一月底以前召集专员、县长、专县财政科长会议，各县于二月十五日前开完区、村干部会议。在会议上：
    甲、所有到会干部，应真正认识到新税则发展生产、保障供给的基本精神及这一工作的重要性，认识到本地评产是高是低的真实情况，实事求是，走群众路线，克服任何可能发生的自私本位主义、地方主义、经验主义、主观主义、尾巴主义。
    乙、认真研究农业税则，特别是本府颁布的订产标准，应统一一致起来，如有意见，可尽量向本府事先提出，但不得擅自修改。
    丙、初步分析各地数字，将每人平均土地，每亩平均产量，每人平均产量，其他收入（果木等）所占比例，分别不同经济区仔细的、反复的比较（尤其着重于交界地区数字之比较），连系典型材料研究分析，从而提出现实的工作计划和工作要求，以期达到产量真实、平衡与固定。
    丁、介绍与总结本区历年评产中好坏典型材料，交流经验。
    戊、在会议和工作进行中，可请一部分农民代表或公正老农参加，人民代表会健全的县，并应与人民代表会共同主持。
    （二）掌握交界地、标准地产量，掌握各地数字，及时检查纠正。——为了平衡各地区间的产量，应采逐级联合勘订交界地的办法，各行署的交界地，由行署于二月十日前派出干部到本府指定地点（另通知），会同当地及友邻区干部，在本府派员主持下，进行联合勘订。各专署交界地区，由邻居专署在行署主持下联合勘订，县区依此类推。各村则应共同组成“联合勘查委员会”，克服村本位。为防止联村本位，可从交界地区标准地做起（标准地可规定几块）推及内地。为防止把标准地孤立起来，应及时掌握各地数字（特别是每亩平均产量）以标准地产量为参考尺度，加以审查对比，并于历年数字对比，追究其增减具体原因。当交界地重点村初步告一段落时（约在工作开始后十天至半月），县应召开检查会一次，传播经验，纠正偏向，然后全面展开。去年北岳、冀中选择熟习情况的公正老农结合区村干部，在附近村流动勘查，收效甚好，可供各地参考。对争取今年能固定产量与负担的县份，行署须派干部或委托专署派干部到县协助和检查。
    （三）这一工作做好的关键，在于领导。——为实现上述要求，必须有强有力的领导核心。必须有力量的统一与各方面步骤的协调。为此，行署、专区、县三级应由行政负责人、人民代表会（有人民代表会的县）、农会、财政部门及其他有关的部门共五人至七人，组成“农业税调查评议委员会”，由行政负责人任主任。委员会要切实负责，解决任务与力量、时间的矛盾问题，解决与结束土改整党，准备生产及支前、扩军等工作的结合问题。“调查评议委员会”无上下级关系。其决定通过各组织系统下达。
    （四）本府去年十月颁发之关于农业税土地亩数及常年产量订定标准之规定执行中的几个问题：
    一、营造尺式样附发，只供县以上政府比较折合地亩之用。
    二、第二条第三款４项“当地情况，如人稠地窄，精耕细作，或地广人稀广种薄收，均按实际情况加以区别”一段，改为“当地情况，即该地区一般劳力、肥料、耕作技术等情况”。
    三、第二条第三款末句“一般说六成至八成年景，即可称为常年”删去。
    四、关于评产中各种粮食的折合率，本府另行通知。
    （五）在执行新税则与评产标准中，有何反映意见，均望及时收集，报告本府，以便将来研究修正。在评产工作后期，应连带调查麦田亩数及年景（列入汇报及总结），以供夏征参考。
    （六）、严格执行报告与总结制度：
    甲、专员、县长每半月一次。
    乙、凡争取今年达到产量真实，负担平衡和固定的县份，除向专区、行署汇报外，须直接向本府汇报。
    丙、每行署另在新区中选二至四个不同类型的县，直接向本府汇报。
    丁、工作总结应于四月下旬大体做出，本府将于四月底召集各行署财政处行政科长会议，各地应将今年夏征意见及农业税调查评议、总结（特别是各县数字）带来。
    （七）调查经费：册籍印刷费在财务费项下开支，由各行署在节约原则下规定掌握，其他一切开支（如聘请公正老农、协助人员出村时吃饭及笔墨油炭等），则由地方粮款内开支，严禁铺张浪费。
