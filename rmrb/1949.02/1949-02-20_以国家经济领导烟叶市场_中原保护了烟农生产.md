　　Xinhua News Agency, Central Plains, February 14th: The economic and trade organs of the Central Plains Liberated Area People's Government have stabilized tobacco leaf prices with the economic strength of the state, protecting the interests of the vast number of tobacco farmers and supporting the tobacco industry's production. In the ten counties of western Henan, including Xiangcheng, Xuchang, Yexian, and Linying, there are more than 650,000 mu of tobacco fields, producing more than 86 million jin of tobacco leaves annually. The quality of the tobacco is very good and it was previously sold well in Shanghai, Hankou, and Southeast Asia. Last year, due to the decline of the cigarette industry in the Kuomintang-controlled areas, fewer tobacco merchants came to western Henan, sales were sluggish, and prices were greatly reduced due to the manipulation of tobacco merchants. In order to protect the interests of tobacco farmers, in addition to ordering state-owned stores in various places to purchase tobacco leaves to maintain tobacco prices, the People's Government also established a Tobacco Administration Bureau to manage tobacco firms and reduce their feudal exploitation of tobacco farmers, so that tobacco farmers would suffer less losses. However, since December of last year, due to the military defeat of the Kuomintang, large capitalists engaged in tobacco leaf business in Shanghai, Hankou and other places fled south, causing the tobacco market in Xuchang and other places to almost come to a standstill. At that time, it was also approaching the Lunar New Year, and tobacco farmers were in urgent need of funds. Tobacco merchants took the opportunity to lower tobacco prices, attempting to harm farmers for profit. The Xuchang Tobacco Administration Bureau then had state-owned stores purchase in large quantities. Seeing that there was no opportunity to exploit, private merchants also followed suit, so that not only were the tobacco leaves on the market able to be sold, but the tobacco prices were also stable and did not fall. In order to lead the tobacco leaf market in a more planned way and protect tobacco leaf production, the Central Plains Trading Corporation established Taifeng Tobacco Company on January 3rd to manage tobacco leaves, and is preparing to open up sales to friendly neighboring liberated areas such as North China, and open a cigarette factory to produce finished products.

　　以国家经济领导烟叶市场
  　中原保护了烟农生产
    【新华社中原十四日电】中原解放区人民政府的经济贸易机关，以国家的经济力量平稳烟叶价格，保护了广大烟农的利益并扶植了烟业生产。在河南西部襄城、许昌、叶县、临颖等十县有烟田六十五万多亩，年产烟叶八千六百多万斤，烟质很好，过去畅销于上海、汉口和南洋等地。去年因国民党统治区卷烟业衰落，来豫西的烟商减少，销路不畅，加以烟商操纵，烟价就大为低落。人民政府为保护烟农利益，除一面令各地公营商店收购烟叶维持烟价外，又成立烟草管理局，管理烟行，减少其对烟农之封建剥削，使烟农少受损失。但自去年十二月起，又由于国民党的军事溃败，上海、汉口等地经营烟叶的大资本家纷纷南逃，使许昌等地烟市几陷停顿。而当时又正届农历年关，烟农需款甚急，烟商更乘机压低烟价，企图伤农渔利，许昌市烟草管理局乃由公营商店大批收购，私商见无机可投也就跟着收购，这样，不仅使上市烟叶得以成交，并使烟价平稳未跌。中原贸易总公司为更有计划地领导烟叶市场，保护烟叶生产，又于一月三日成立太丰烟草公司经营烟叶，正准备向华北等友邻解放区打开销路，并开办卷烟厂自制成品。
