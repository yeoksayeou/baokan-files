Xinhua News Agency, Tianjin, 21st (Delayed Dispatch) – Less than a week after the liberation of Tianjin, grain from the surrounding areas is pouring into the market, public and private industries and businesses in the city are gradually resuming operations, and general prices are stabilizing. The People's Liberation Army and the democratic government had already made preparations for the food supply of Tianjin citizens after liberation. The liberated areas of North China, including Ji-Zhong, Ji-Nan, and Ji-Lu-Yu, had already prepared 200.08 million catties of grain for reserve use. As soon as Tianjin was liberated, farmers from various places braved the bitter cold, driving carts and rubber-wheeled vehicles, continuously transporting grain into Tianjin. More than 2,000 laborers on the Daqing River and Ziya River are working hard to break the ice and open the rivers to remove obstacles to transportation to Tianjin. Due to the influx of grain, more than 170 flour mills in the city have resumed operations, and well-known private flour mills also started operating on the 18th, now producing 2,000 bags of flour per day. The Tianjin Municipal People's Government Bureau of Industry and Commerce also sent working groups to Jinghai, Tangguantun, Xincheng and other places to obtain assistance from local democratic governments, convene farmers, peddlers, and merchants for discussions, and mobilize and organize them to transport vegetables, oil, and meat into Tianjin. As a result, fresh vegetables and meat, which Tianjin citizens had not seen for many days, can now be freely purchased again. Public enterprises are recovering the fastest. Public utilities such as electricity, telephone, and tap water are being supplied as usual as soon as the military control commission takes over. The Tianjin Branch of the China Textile Construction Company, the Tianjin Branch of the Central Machinery Factory, and the Tianjin Steel Plant of the North China Iron and Steel Company have also mostly resumed work. Private companies and shops are also reopening one after another. Quanye Market and Tianxiang Market have been restored, and retail markets on Changchun Road, Xing'an Road, Huangjia Garden, West Ma Road, and Dajing Road are particularly lively. The Tianjin Branch of the People's Bank of China was established on the 16th and began to accept the exchange of puppet gold yuan notes the next day. The exchange rate is six yuan of puppet gold yuan notes for one yuan of People's currency. There are other preferential measures for workers, farmers, factory employees, teachers, students, poor civil servants, and urban poor. The exchange period is 20 days. In addition to five central exchange groups and 18 exchange offices in the city, the bank also entrusted more than 150 private banks and silver shops to accept the exchange. In recent days, people from all walks of life have been enthusiastically exchanging. Many merchants have also voluntarily refused to use puppet gold yuan notes. At the beginning of the liberation of Tianjin, due to the long-term deception and propaganda of the Japanese invaders and the Kuomintang reactionaries, a few industrialists and businessmen had some concerns in their minds, such as wondering whether they could trade freely and worrying about how to deal with the puppet gold yuan notes. Therefore, they adopted a wait-and-see attitude towards the resumption of work and business. The Tianjin Municipal Military Control Commission of the People's Liberation Army and the People's Government immediately convened symposiums for the vegetable and coal industries, explained the current situation and the Chinese Communist Party's urban policy and the economic construction policy of "developing production, prospering the economy, taking into account both public and private interests, and benefiting both labor and capital," and announced the handling methods of puppet gold yuan notes. These people's concerns gradually disappeared, and by the 20th, most industries had reopened.

Xinhua News Agency, Tianjin, 29th – The Tianjin Municipal Military Control Commission of the People's Liberation Army and the democratic municipal government distributed 3.9 million catties of emergency relief grain on the sixth day after the liberation of Tianjin (February 1) to aid nearly 260,000 disaster victims who were brutally persecuted by the Kuomintang bandit troops. Before the liberation of the city, the Kuomintang bandit troops set fire to civilian houses in the suburbs, burning many villages within ten li of the city into ruins, causing a large number of residents to be displaced. According to preliminary investigations, the number of disaster victims in the city reached more than 259,500, accounting for 13 percent of the city's total population. The eighth district was the hardest hit. Houses in Xiyingmen, Yangzhuangzi and other areas have been completely reduced to ashes. Within four bao, there were 600 households with no food or clothing. In the fifth district, more than 300 civilian houses in the fourteenth and fifteenth bao were burned down, accounting for about 90 percent of the total number of houses in the two bao. The Muslim village of Muzhuangzi in the western suburbs of Tianjin was completely burned down, and hundreds of households in the entire village were burned to the ground. Two mosques and three charity schools also suffered the catastrophe, and several people were burned alive. When the bandit troops burned houses in Yixingbu, a resident named Guo Changfu wanted to go home to rescue his seventy-year-old father, but was rudely stopped by the bandit troops. Guo Changfu watched his father die tragically in the fire. Liu Zhangshi, a woman from Donggouyan in the Qianfo Temple, had just given birth four days before being driven out by the bandit troops and died of a stroke. In other districts and villages, many people were burned to death or brutally killed by the bandit troops while trying to put out the fires. After the liberation of Tianjin, the Military Control Commission and the People's Government deeply cared about the disaster victims in the city, and immediately organized comfort groups to go to various disaster areas to visit each household and investigate the disaster. Wherever the comfort groups went, they were surrounded by the disaster victims, who accused the Kuomintang army of its crimes, with tears in their eyes.

　　四乡粮食菜蔬源源入市
  　天津工商复业物价平稳
    民主政府发放赈粮救济灾民
    【新华社天津廿一日电】（迟到）津市解放不到一周，四乡粮食源源入市，市内公私营工商业陆续开工复业，一般物价已渐趋平稳。人民解放军和民主政府对解放以后的津市民食，早已预作准备，仅华北解放区的冀中、冀南、冀鲁豫三地，即已筹粮二亿零八万斤，储备待用。天津一告解放，各地农民便在寒风凛冽中赶着大车和胶轮车，络绎不绝地运粮入津。大清河和子牙河上的两千多民工则全力砸冰开河，以扫除对津市运输的障碍。由于粮食源源入市，市内磨坊已有一百七十余家恢复营业，著名的私营面粉厂也于十八日开工，现日产面粉二千袋。津市人民市政府工商局又派出工作组分赴静海、唐官屯、新城等地，取得当地民主政府协助，召集农民、小贩、行商等座谈，发动和组织他们贩运菜蔬油肉入津，因而天津市民多日未见的新鲜菜蔬肉类又能自由购得。公营企业恢复最快，电灯、电话、自来水等公用事业，军管会一经接管，便照常供给水、电。中国纺织建设公司天津分公司、中央机器厂天津分厂，华北钢铁公司天津炼钢厂等也已大部复工。私营公司、商号亦陆续开业，劝业市场、天祥市场都已恢复，长春路、兴安路、黄家花园、西马路、大经路等地零售市场尤为热闹。中国人民银行天津分行十六日成立，次日即开始收兑伪金元券。比价是伪金元券六元换人民券一元。对工人、农民、工厂职员、教职员、学生、贫苦公务人员及城市贫民等，则另有优待办法。兑换期限为二十天。该行除在市内设有五个中心兑换组和十八个兑换所外，并委托一百五十余家私营银行、银号代为收兑。连日各界人民踊跃前往兑换。商人中并有许多自动拒绝使用伪金元券的。津市解放之初，由于日寇与国民党反动派的长期欺骗宣传，曾有少数工商业者思想上存在着某些顾虑，如怀疑能否自由贸易，担心伪金元券不知如何处理等等。因此对复工复业采取观望态度。人民解放军天津市军事管制委员会和人民政府当即分别召开了菜蔬、煤炭等业座谈会，在会上讲解了目前时局及中国共产党的城市政策和“发展生产，繁荣经济，公私兼顾，劳资两利”的经济建设方针，并且宣布了伪金元券的处理办法，这些人的顾虑，就逐渐消除，至二十日各行业已大部开市。
    【新华社天津二十九日电】人民解放军天津市军事管制委员会及民主市政府于津市解放后第六日（二月一日）发放急赈粮三百九十万斤救济惨遭国民党匪军迫害的数近二十六万灾民。该市解放前，国民党匪军曾在市郊纵火大烧民房，将距城十华里以内的许多村庄，烧成一片瓦砾，致大批居民流离失所。据初步调查：全市灾民数达二十五万九千五百余人，占全市人口总数百分之十三。其中以第八区受害最重，西营门、杨庄子一带房屋，已全成灰烬，四个保内，即有六百户居民无衣无食。第五区十四、十五两保被烧毁民房三百余间，占该两保总房数的百分之九十左右。津市西郊的回民村穆庄子，全村数百户都被烧光，两座清真寺及三座义学，亦同罹浩劫，并有数人被活活烧死。匪军在宜兴埠烧房时，居民郭长福要回家去抢救他的七十多岁的老父亲，竟被匪军横蛮拦阻，郭长福便眼看着自己的父亲惨死在大火里。千佛寺东沟沿妇女刘张氏，生小孩才四天，被匪军赶出后即中风致死。其他各区村因救火被匪军烧死或惨杀者甚多。津市解放后，军管会及人民市政府对市内灾民，深为关怀，立即组织慰问团，分赴各灾区挨户慰问，调查灾情。慰问团每到一地，即为灾民所包围，灾民们纷纷控诉国民党军罪行，声泪俱下。
