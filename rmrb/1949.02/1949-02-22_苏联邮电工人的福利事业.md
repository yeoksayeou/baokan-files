　　Soviet Postal and Telecommunications Workers' Welfare Services
    Markov, Secretary of the Central Committee of the Soviet Postal and Telecommunications Workers' Union

    Not long ago, a delegation of British railway workers visiting the Soviet Union raised a question about the life and work of postal and telecommunications workers at a reception hosted by the All-Union Central Council of Trade Unions. One of the delegates, a railway telegraph operator, was asked by some members of the Soviet trade union about the life of British postal and telecommunications workers.

    He said: "The war has had a really great impact on the lives of British postal and telecommunications workers."

    He was asked: "What have you done to improve your living conditions?"

    He replied: "I don't believe that methods like strikes can solve the problem, but I believe that when the time comes, the Labor government will also take care of the workers in this sector. By the way, I haven't seen you conduct many struggles to improve the working conditions of Soviet postal and telecommunications workers." Then he added: "In short, I have never heard of a strike in the Soviet Union."

    Because no Soviet postal and telecommunications workers participated in that reception, the British guest's question has not yet been answered.

    Now, I would like to talk about the working and living conditions of Soviet postal and telecommunications workers.

    Soviet postmen, telegraph operators, and other workers do not strike not because this method "disrupts public order," but because there are no contradictions between them and the management that cannot be resolved amicably with the help of the trade union. Like other workers in the Soviet Union, our 500,000 trade union members all know this. When there are more complex disputes, the Central Committee of the Trade Union and the government mediate.

    Often, without the proposal of the Central Committee of the Trade Union, the government takes measures to improve the living conditions of postal and telecommunications workers. For example, the government ordered certain departments to increase the wages of employees in 1944, which is a good example.

    There are many other facts that can clarify why Soviet postal and telecommunications workers do not need to strike.

    For example, the state spends about 2.5 million rubles annually to protect the labor of our trade union members, which deeply moves our trade union members. This fund is entirely given to the Central Committee of the Trade Union, and the committee then distributes it to various postal and telecommunications departments and enterprises. Telegraph operators, telephone operators, broadcasters, and other employees who need to lean over machines for several hours need special rest facilities. If you go into any larger telephone bureau during lunchtime, you can see skilled sports instructors leading employees in calisthenics. You can also see masseurs massaging the hands of telephone operators.

    The following fact is another example of caring for workers: the Moscow Postal and Telecommunications Workers' Labor Protection Laboratory has designed a special shoe for postmen. This laboratory, founded by the state, is now studying how to eliminate the special bacteria that easily infect workers in this department. A group of physicians is currently studying the impact of radio station's ultra-high frequency range on the human body. Undoubtedly, the results of these studies, like many previous studies, will create new machines to protect the health of workers.

    Various management departments also spend a lot of money to improve working conditions. In fact, the collective contracts they sign with the trade union committees representing employees require them to do so. These contracts have been discussed at the Trade Union Congress, and many suggestions have been put forward at the congress. Workers pointed out that there is a need to further expand the construction of housing, and advocated that any department, if possible, should abolish the simple system of paying wages on time and switch to a system of rewarding wages based on the quality and quantity of work, because this is more beneficial to workers. At the Kiev Congress, a young female worker emphasized that general education must be implemented for telegraph operators and telephone operators. Her suggestion has been incorporated into the collective contract, so the Kiev City Telecommunications Bureau is now running a school for dozens of employees of all ages to study for free. In two or three years, they can complete their secondary education and leave the school.

    Various management departments must provide vegetable garden land to all those who need it free of charge in accordance with the collective contract. They also have to provide transportation to employees to transport the harvest to the city. Soviet postal and telecommunications workers have been allocated a total of 21,000 hectares of vegetable garden land this year, which clearly shows the extent of their amateur gardening activities.

    Of course, the collective contract cannot cover all aspects of the close relationship between employees and management departments. For example, the fact that the Soviet Ministry of Postal and Telecommunications loans 1.5 million rubles to its employees every year to help them buy poultry cannot be reflected solely by the collective contract. Mainly rural postmen need this loan, which is generally 3,000 rubles, with a very low interest rate, and is repaid after three years.

    Furthermore, individual housing construction is not stipulated in the collective contract, because individual housing construction is particularly widespread in rural areas. The funds required for individual housing construction are mostly subsidized by the Ministry of Postal and Telecommunications, which lends each person 10,000 rubles, which is repaid in eight to ten years.

    Among the many ruins left by the German invaders, nine belonged to the buildings of the Postal and Telecommunications Workers' Union. Four are sanatoriums and five are convalescent homes. In 1946, the restoration work of these recuperation centers began, costing a total of 12 million rubles. Last year, the recuperation agencies on the Black Sea coast, which provide vacations for 30,000 postal and telecommunications workers, were repaired. On average, one in three vacationers can enjoy the facilities for free, and the rest only need to pay one-third of the corresponding price. The money for restoring the recuperation centers and paying for the use of the facilities is all allocated from the state's social insurance fund. This year, the 210 million rubles we received from the trade union were all allocated from this social insurance fund. This money is all used for measures to care for the health of workers.

    In addition to this, the health authorities also run many medical institutions to provide free medical treatment for postal and telecommunications workers. These include hospitals, clinics, etc. All postal and telecommunications agencies with more than 500 employees have such medical facilities.

    The Trade Union also pays for sending the children of its members to spend their summer vacations. This year, a total of 31,000 children went on vacation to summer camps.

    Finally, I would like to talk about the training system that helps all employees of our trade union improve their skills, thereby increasing their wages.

    The training in this department is the same as in other sectors of the national economy. Each collective contract includes several articles on training. Engineers and other specialized technicians who are hired as lecturers are paid by the management department. For example, the Moscow Central Telecommunications Bureau has made the management department responsible for setting up training courses to teach 3,000 employees secondary specialized knowledge and improve their skills. There are also five postal and telecommunications technical schools, and employees who want to receive secondary technical education can choose freely. Those who are already working in the postal and telecommunications sector have priority for admission. Students can receive public funds and accommodation during their studies.

    Furthermore, the Moscow Postal and Telecommunications School has a correspondence department. More than 1,000 students from this department recently came to Moscow to participate in the summer examinations. During the 40-day examination period, the telecommunications bureaus, telephone bureaus, etc. that sent the future postal and telecommunications engineers to take the examinations paid the students their original salaries as usual in accordance with the order of the Ministry of Postal and Telecommunications.

    I think these few facts are enough to prove that the close relationship between Soviet postal and telecommunications workers and their management departments is very different from the relationship that a British telegraph operator sees in his own country. (Translated by Xu Xu)

### 苏联邮电工人的福利事业

　　苏联邮电工人的福利事业
    苏邮电工人职工会中委会书记  马尔柯夫
    不久以前，访问苏联的英国铁路工人代表团在全苏职工会中央委员会主办的招待会上提出了一个关于邮电工人之生活与工作的问题。代表团员中有一位铁路电报员，苏联某些职工会会员问他，英国邮电工人的生活怎样。
    他说：“战争给予英国邮电工人之生活的影响实在很大。”
    问他：“你们为改善生活条件都作了些什么？”
    他答道：“我不相信罢工之类的办法能够解决问题，但是我相信赶到一定的时候，工党政府对这部门的工人也会照顾到。附带地谈一谈，我并没有看见过你们为了改善苏联邮电员工的劳动条件而进行过很多次的斗争。”然后他又加上了一句：“总而言之，我向来也没听说在苏联有过一次罢工。”
    因为在那个招待会上没有苏联的邮电工人参加，所以那位英国客人的问题还一直没有得到解答。
    现在，我想把苏联邮电工人的劳动与生活条件讲一下。
    苏联的邮差、电报员等工人不罢工并不是因为这种办法“扰乱公共秩序”，而是因为在他们和管理部之间不存在经过职工会的帮助也不能友好解决的矛盾。正和苏联其他工人一样，我们职工会的会员五十万人都知道这个。有了比较复杂的争论的时候，由职工会中央委员会和政府调解。
    往往用不着职工会中央委员会提议，政府就采取措施改善邮电工作人员的生活条件。如政府曾在一九四四年命令某几部门增加工作人员的工资，这就是一个很好的例子。
    还有许多事实可以把为什么苏联的邮电员工不需要罢工的道理弄清楚。
    例如：国家为保护我们职工会会员的劳动每年花费约二百五十万卢布，这使我们职工会的会员深为感动。这笔经费全部交给职工会中央委员会，委员会再把它分给各邮电部门和企业。电报员、电话交换手、广播员等等，这些需要继续好几个钟头俯身伏于机器上的工作的员工需要特殊的休养方便。无论哪一个较大的电话局，如果诸位在吃晌饭时间进去看一看，就可以看见熟练的体育员在那儿领着员工练习健身体操。还可以看见按摩师们推拿电话员的手。
    下列事实就是关心工人的另一个例子：莫斯科邮电工人劳动保护实验所为邮差们设计了一种特殊的鞋。由国家创办的这个实验所现正研究消灭容易感染本部门工人的特种病菌。一批医师现正研究电台的超高周率界对人体的影响。毫无疑问，这些研究的结果，正和从前的许多研究一样，将造出新的机器以保护工人的健康。
    各管理部为了改善劳动条件也花费了大批经费。事实上，它们同代表员工的职工会委员会签订的集体合同要求它们这样作。这些合同曾在职工会大会上讨论过，并在大会上提出了许多建议。工人们指出，需要进一步广泛建筑房屋，并主张无论哪一个部门，如果可能的话，就应当废除简单的按时发薪制，改为按照工作的质与量酬给工资的制度。因为这对工人更有利。在基辅的大会上，一位青年女工强调指出，必须为电报员和电话交换手实行一般的教育。她的建议已被载入集体合同，因此基辅城的电信局现开办一所学校，供各种年龄的员工数十人免费学习。两三年以后，他们就可以完成中等教育离开学校。
    各管理部必须按照集体合同免费供应菜园地给所有的需要者。它们还得供应运输工具予员工，往城市运输收获品。苏联的邮电工人今年共分得菜园地两万一千公顷，从这一点事实就可以清楚地了解其业余园地活动之范围如何广泛。
    集体合同当然不可能包括员工和管理部之亲密关系的各方面。例如：苏联邮电部每年贷款一百五十万卢布予其员工、帮助他们购买家禽，这件事实，单凭集体合同就不能反映出来。主要是乡村的邮差需要这种贷款，每份大抵是三千卢布，利率很低，三年后还清。
    并且，集体合同中也不规定个人的房屋建筑，因为在乡村地方个人房屋的建筑特别广泛。个人建筑房屋时所需款项多半由邮电部补足，邮电部为此目的贷予每人一万卢布，八年到十年还清。
    德寇留下来的许多废墟中有九处是属于邮电工人职工会的建筑物。其中四处是休养所、五处是疗养院。一九四六年，这些疗养中心地的复兴工作即已开始，通共花费了一千二百万卢布。黑海岸上供三万邮电工人休假的疗养机关去年即已修复。休假者平均三人中有一个人得以免费享用设备，其余的只需要担负应付的价格三分之一。为修复疗养中心地和支付设备享用费的钱全由国家的社会保险基金中拨出。今年我们职工会所领到的两亿一千万卢布都是从这社会保险基金中拨出来的。这笔钱全为关心工人的健康之措施而用掉。
    除此而外，卫生当局还经营许多医疗机关，给邮电工人免费治病。其中包括医院、诊疗所等等，凡是拥有员工五百人以上的邮电机关都有这种医疗设备。
    职工会也出费遣送其会员的儿女消度暑假。今年赴夏令营休假的儿童总计三万一千人。
    最后，我想谈谈帮助我们职工会的全体员工提高技术，从而增加工资的训练制度。
    本部门的训练和国民经济其它部门的一样。每一集体合同都包括几条是关于训练的。被聘充当讲师的工程师及其他专门技师，薪资由管理部发给。例如：莫斯科中央电信局曾使管理部负责设立讲习班、为三千员工教授中等专门知识，并提高技术。并有五所邮电技术学校，想受中等技术教育的员工，可以随便选择。已经在邮电部门工作的人有优先权入学。学生们在学习期间可领公费以及住所等等。
    再说，莫斯科邮电学校设有一个函授学系。本学系的学生日前到莫斯科来参加夏季测验者一千多人。在四十天的测验期间，遣送将来的邮电工程师前来投考之电信局、电话局等等均按照邮电部的命令照常发原薪予学生。
    我想这几点事实足够证明：苏联邮电工人及其管理部的亲密关系和一位英国电报员在他的祖国所看到的关系是大不相同。　　　　　（徐徐译）
