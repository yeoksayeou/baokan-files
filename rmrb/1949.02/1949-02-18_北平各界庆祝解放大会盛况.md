Xinhua News Agency, Beiping, 13th: "Grand Celebration of Liberation Conference and Parade by All Circles in Beiping" is as follows:

Of the primary, middle, and higher education schools attending the conference, there were 144 organized and statistically accounted units, 51 Yangge dance troupes and drum teams. The slogans were diverse, with Tsinghua University alone having more than 250 colorful flags and banners. Among the student ranks, there were 32 Mao Zedong portraits of various sizes and shapes. The south side of the venue, the Gate of China, was packed before the official start of the meeting, making it impossible for many units to sign in, and many sporadically entering citizens could not be counted. A student in charge of registration said with great regret, "It's difficult to have an accurate number of attendees today. At my registration point alone, at least 20,000 people did not register."

The People's Liberation Army arrived earliest. This people's armed force was the most well-organized at the venue, with each gun polished brightly. They raised the various award flags they had won in the past, some rectangular, some triangular, some red, some green... almost every company had several. The combat heroes also wore medals on their chests, with one person wearing as many as four.

Many units' Yangge dance troupes went specifically to perform in front of the PLA teams. The PLA soldiers responded with majestic singing and enthusiastic applause after each performance.

The railway workers from Yangcun to Fengtai section got up at 2:30 a.m. today and rushed to the venue early in the morning, excitedly saying, "It wasn't for nothing."

More than 1,000 workers from the tricycle and rickshaw unions participated in the celebration of the Liberation Conference. A rickshaw puller named Chang Gengang said: "We took a day off specifically to attend this meeting. I've lived for more than 30 years and this is the first time I've seen so many people at a meeting."

The rickshaw pullers pooled money to buy red and green paper and made many small flags, shouting slogans with great joy. A rickshaw puller in his fifties said, "We used to suffer all kinds of grievances. Some people regarded us as cattle and horses, and the Kuomintang die-hard military police treated us like chickens and sheep. We are happy to celebrate the liberation of Beiping because we will no longer be bullied."

At 10:00 a.m., the 36 members of the faculty and staff working group of the Beiping Art School carried eight six-foot wide and eight-foot long portraits and propaganda cartoons they had painted overnight, including portraits of Chairman Mao, Commander-in-Chief Zhu, Lin Biao, Nie Rongzhen, Ye Jianying and other generals. These portraits were hung on the Tiananmen Forbidden City wall where the rostrum was located, attracting the attention of thousands of people.

The conference's security team was composed of one thousand workers and one thousand students. During the meeting, they stood guard on all sides of the field. During the parade, they held hands and patrolled on both sides of the队伍.

The miners from the Mentougou Mining Brigade participating in the celebration, each carrying a coal shovel, more than half wearing the kiln hats required for work, holding hoes, competing with the farmers carrying hoes.

The Mentougou Mining Brigade's small cart performance vividly depicted the embarrassing situation of the number one war criminal Chiang Kai-shek. The goblin-like Soong Mei-ling sat in the cart holding a bulging handbag. Chiang Kai-shek pulled the cart in front, swaying from side to side, wearing a cloak. Behind the cart, a foreigner with a hideous face and wearing an American hat pushed. On top of the small cart was a paper banner, with the words "Chiang Kai-shek's Great Removal" written in large characters on the front, and the four black characters "Sent to America" on the back.

The most active and popular with the masses at the venue was the collective costume performance of the Yangge dance troupe of the North China University Literary and Art Troupe. Thirty-six people, including twenty flower drummers. They sang and drummed in the cold wind, full of vigor.

"March of the Eighth Route Army" was the most familiar song to the PLA soldiers and students. Whenever the military band on the truck played this tune, everyone sang "Forward! Forward! Forward! Our troops are facing the sun."

The ranks of the Peking University Lecturers Association included elderly professors and mothers holding children. The enthusiastic and joyful atmosphere was unprecedented in previous gatherings and parades in Beiping.

Five elderly middle school teachers, missing the assembly, rushed to the venue, and after turning around for a long time, they found their team and happily shouted: "We have a team too!" At 12 noon, snowflakes fell from the sky. Someone asked Chen Ying, a nine-year-old primary school student from Zizhong Elementary School: "Are you cold?" She waved a small flag and said, "I'm not cold. There are so many people. I've never seen so many, it's even more lively than the New Year."

As the parade started, the sun suddenly appeared faintly. At this time, many teams immediately sang "The East is Red, the sun rises, China has produced a Mao Zedong..."

In the ranks of the Pingjin Area Clothing Factory workers, a female worker in her forties or fifties regretted forgetting to wear her glasses and said repeatedly, "Such a big celebration, I can't see it clearly."

The children of Changxindian Rotary Elementary School didn't lag behind in celebrating the liberation of Beiping. Their bugles were blown neatly and majestically, and the masses said, "They're really not messing around."

At the front of the Shijingshan Power Plant's team, a large flag was raised high, with the words "Strive for a bright future for the people's democratic Beiping" written on it. A merchant saw it and said, "It's true. When the Kuomintang was here, the power was always cut off. Since the Liberation Army came, the power hasn't been cut off. The workers of Shijingshan have made a great contribution." A college student added: "The working class can not only generate electricity and emit light, but also lead us to a bright future."

When the People's Liberation Army participating in the parade passed by, an old lady squeezed out of the crowd and said, "Let me see the People's Army." After she saw the PLA, she said, "Our People's Army is really big! They carry such heavy guns and they're not tired!"

In the parade, there was a flying red dragon, with the striking characters "Build a New Beiping" written on it, winning countless cheers from the masses. This was the masterpiece of the Tsinghua University students.

A tofu vendor saw the parade and said with great joy, "The Kuomintang didn't let us celebrate the first and fifteenth of the lunar month. Today we can have a good time!"

In less than a month since the liberation of Beiping, most workers, students, and small businessmen have learned to dance the Yangge. Almost every unit participating in the conference today has a Yangge dance troupe.

At dusk, the parade dispersed, and groups of people went home. They sang happily all the way: "The moon comes out bright and clear, the savior, the Communist Party, has come..."

A former civil servant said to the person next to him: "A month ago, this 'ancient city' was still a 'bitter city', but now it's smiling!"

　　北平各界庆祝解放大会盛况
    【新华社北平十三日电】“北平市各界庆祝解放大会及游行盛况”文如下：
    大中小学到会场的，有组织有统计的就有一百四十四个单位，有五十一个秧歌队和锣鼓队，宣传标语，花样繁多，仅清华大学，彩色旗帜标语有二百五十多个。学生行列中，大的小的方的圆的毛主席画像有三十二个。会场南面的中华门，在未正式开会之前，挤满了人，使得许多单位没法签到，许多零星入场的市民也无法统计。负责签到的一位学生很惋惜的说“今天到会人数，难有确切的数字。光是我这个签到处，至少有二万人没有登记。”
    到得最早的是人民解放军，会场以这支人民武装最整齐，每支枪都擦得雪亮。他们今天把历次得到的各种奖旗升出来了，有长方的，有三角的，有红的，有绿的，……差不多每一个连都有几面。战斗英雄们的胸前，也都挂着勋章，最多的一个人有挂四个的。
    许多单位的秧歌队，都专门到解放军的队前去表演。解放军战士们在每一个节目完了之后，都用雄壮的歌声和热烈的掌声答谢。
    杨村至丰台段的铁路工人今天夜里两点半钟就起床了，一大早赶到会场，兴奋的说“总算没白赶”。
    三轮车，人力车两个工会的工人有一千多人，参加了庆祝解放大会，一个名叫常根刚的车夫说：我们为了参加这个会特别歇了一天，我活了三十多年头一次看见这么多的人开会。
    三轮车夫都凑钱买了红绿纸，制了许多的小旗子，一个个兴高采烈的叫着口号。有个五十来岁的车夫说“以前我们受尽了气，有些人把我们看成牛马，国民党顽固军警把我们当做鸡羊。庆祝北平解放咱们就高兴了，因为我们不再受人欺侮了。”
    十点钟时，北平艺专教职员工作团，三十六个人抬来了他们连夜赶绘成的八幅六尺宽八尺长的大像和宣传漫画，其中有毛主席、朱总司令、林彪、聂荣臻、叶剑英等将军像，这些像被挂在主席台所在的天安门紫禁城城墙上，引起成千成万人的注意。
    大会纠察队由一千个工人，一千个学生组成，开会时，他们站在场子四方守护，游行时，他们又手拉着手，在队伍两边巡逻。
    门头沟工矿大队参加庆祝的矿工，一个个都拿着挖煤的铲子，有半数以上头戴工作时所必须戴的窑帽，手执锄头，与扛着锄头的农民相互媲美。
    门头沟工矿大队的小车会，把头号战犯蒋介石狼狈的情形，描绘得很逼真，妖精般的宋美龄拿着鼓起的手皮包坐在车子里，蒋介石披着斗蓬在前面一摇一摆的拉着，后面推车的是一个面目狰狞，头戴美国帽的洋人。在小车的顶上张着一个纸幡，纸幡前面用大字写着“蒋介石大搬家”，背面是“送往美国”四个黑字。
    会场中最活跃也最为群众热烈欢迎的是华北大学文工团的秧歌大队的集体化装表演。三十六个人，有二十个花鼓。他们在冷风里边唱边打鼓，精神十分旺盛。
    “八路军进行曲”是解放军战士和学生们最熟悉的歌子，每当卡车上军乐队奏起这个调子时，到处唱起“向前！向前！向前！我们的队伍向太阳。”
    北大讲助会的队伍中有年老的教授，有抱着孩子的母亲，大家热烈愉快的情绪是历次北平集会游行中所没有的。
    有五个年老的中学教员，没赶上集合，喘喘的赶到会场，转了半天才找到自己的队伍，高兴的叫起来：“我们也有队伍了！”中午十二时，天空飘下一片片雪花，有人问自忠小学校的一个九岁的小学生陈莹：“你冷不冷？”她摇着小旗说：“我不冷，人那么多，我从没有瞧见过，比过年还热闹”。
    游行队伍刚出发时，忽又隐隐现出太阳来，这时，在不少的队伍里，立即大唱“东方红，太阳升，中国出了个毛泽东……”
    平津区被服厂工人行列中有一个四十八九岁的女工，因为忘记戴眼镜后悔的不得了，一遍又一遍的说：“这样大的庆祝会，不能清清楚楚的看一下。”
    长辛店扶轮小学的小朋友们，庆祝北平解放，一点也不后人，他们的军号吹得既整齐又雄壮，群众都说：“真不含糊。”
    石景山发电厂的队伍前面，高举着“为人民民主的北平大放光明而奋斗”的大旗子。一个商人看到了，说道：“真是名符其实。国民党在这儿，这儿老是停电，自从解放军来了，也不停电了，石景山工人的功劳可不小。”有位大学生补充的说：“工人阶级不但能发电放光，而且一定可以领导我们走向光明。”
    当参加游行的人民解放军走过时，一个老太太从人群里挤出来说：“快让我看看人民军。”等她看到解放军后说：“咱们人民军可真不少哇！他们扛着那末重的枪，也不累！”
    游行的队伍里，有一条飞舞着的红色游龙，上边写着“建设新北平”几个醒目的大字，博得群众无数的采声。这是清华大学学生的杰作。
    一个卖豆腐的小贩看见游行的大队，兴高采烈的说：“国民党不让咱们过初一十五，咱们今天可好好过了一下子！”
    北平解放不到一月，大多数工人、学生、小商部学会了扭秧歌，今天参加大会的各单位，几乎都有秧歌队。
    万家灯火时，游行队伍才散，一群的人回家去。他们一路上欢快的唱着：月亮出来明又亮，来了救星共产党……
    一个旧公务员同他旁边的人讲：“一个月前，这座‘古城’还是‘苦城’，如今它笑了！”
