　　Unauthorized Printing and Distribution of Announcements
　　Cixian Tax Bureau Criticized

　　[Report from this newspaper] The Taihang Sixth Special District Tax Bureau issued a circular on January 22nd, criticizing the Cixian Tax Bureau for unauthorized printing and distribution of announcements, violating discipline. The circular stated: The Cixian Tax Bureau unauthorizedly printed and distributed an announcement on January 16th, first disseminating and posting it before sending a copy to the branch bureau, violating the organizational principle of "requesting instructions beforehand and reporting afterwards." From the announcement itself, there were also fundamental errors, such as omitting the word "所得" (income) from the Industrial and Commercial Income Tax and omitting the word "薪给" (salary) from the Salary and Wage Income Tax. Furthermore, the Pengcheng Tax Office was mistakenly written as "Pengcheng Tax Bureau." Especially regarding the collection of slaughter tax, the district bureau had clearly stipulated that, for the convenience of collection, it should be levied by quantity based on heads (specifying the average jin [unit of weight] of pork, mutton, and meat from disabled livestock). They only announced the tax amount payable per head for various livestock and stopped there, arbitrarily changing and acting frivolously. The circular concluded by stating that the county bureau's unorganized and undisciplined behavior, exhibiting independence, was decided to be addressed by ordering the recall of all the announcements and issuing a criticism, while also issuing a circular to all subordinate county tax bureaus to learn from this as a warning.

　　擅自印发布告
  　磁县税务局受到批评
    【本报讯】太行六专区税务局，于一月廿二日通令，批评磁县税务局擅自印发布告，违犯纪律。略称：磁县税务局于一月十六日擅自印发布告一份，先散发张贴后，才寄给分局一张，违犯“事前请示、事后报告”的组织原则。从布告本身来说也犯有原则性错误，如将工商业所得税少写“所得”二字，薪给工资所得税没写“薪给”二字，将彭城税务所误写为“彭城税局”，尤其征收屠宰税问题，区局指示为便利征收曾明文规定从量按头征收（规定猪、羊、残废牲口肉的平均斤称），他们只宣布了各种牲畜每头应纳税额就完事，竟这样擅自更改轻浮从事。通令最后指出，该县局这种无组织无纪律闹独立性的表现，决定除令其将此次所发布告全数收回并给予批评外，特通令所属各县税务局应引以为戒。
