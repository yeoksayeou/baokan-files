　　Correctly Understand the New Democratic Tax Policy
  　Taihang General Bureau Convenes Tax Bureau Chief Meeting
    [Taihang Electric] The Taihang Tax General Bureau convened a meeting of special and county tax bureau chiefs in mid-November of last year, focusing on resolving the ideological issues of tax cadres being unsettled in their tax work. The Taihang tax organization was only established independently in October of last year. Because many cadres underestimated tax work, the work could not be carried out smoothly. Some cadres transferred from government civil affairs and cooperative departments believed that the work of the tax department was simply asking the masses for money and could not organize mass production. Bank work could provide loans to the masses, while tax work required more money, which would lead to mass dissatisfaction in the future. The Tax Bureau Chief of Shahe County, fearing opposition from the masses, dared not say the three words "Tax Bureau." Some also believed that the Tax Bureau was not an important job, and those who worked in the Tax Bureau were not good cadres, and other erroneous statements. Even more, some believed that the leadership's transfer to do tax work was catching them as "scapegoats," so they were very uneasy. Although cadres transferred from the finance department were better, they were often worried that the leadership would not value them, making their work isolated, without status, and without a future. Some comrades even regarded the policy of protecting the development of industry and commerce through taxation as the restoration of exorbitant taxes and levies. In response to the above problems, the leadership first gave a detailed explanation of the New Democratic tax policy, its purpose, and its importance. After more than a day of deliberation and discussion, everyone initially realized ideologically that tax work played a very important role in protecting and developing the New Democratic economy and supporting the war. It is an indispensable part of developing industry and commerce that is beneficial to the national livelihood and restricting industry and commerce that is not beneficial to the national livelihood, and it is not simply a matter of asking for money. With a correct understanding, many confused ideas were resolved, and everyone's emotions gradually stabilized. This meeting also discussed the specific methods and tasks for implementing the tax policy. Everyone believed that the tax work policy should follow the mass line. On the one hand, it relies on tax authorities, but it also needs to organize the masses to crack down on smuggling, prevent tax evasion, and other phenomena. Finally, everyone believed that rectifying the organization and improving cadre allocation is an important guarantee for completing the task. When the meeting adjourned, everyone's emotions were obviously different. Everyone unanimously felt that they lacked knowledge of economic and tax policies, and asked the leadership to print some business learning materials to facilitate improving their work. (Branch Agency Note: The economic departments, like other departments, should abide by the decision of the North China Central Bureau of the CPC on the study of on-the-job cadres and strengthen the theoretical cultivation of each cadre. The confused ideas exposed by the cadres at the meeting of special and county bureau chiefs of the Taihang Tax General Bureau fully illustrate that cadres still lack a basic understanding of the New Democratic economy, which should be taken seriously.)

　　正确认识新民主主义税收政策
  　太行总局召开税务局长会议
    【太行电】太行税务总局于去年十一月中旬召开各专、县税务局长会议，有重点的解决了税务干部不安心税务工作的思想。太行税务机构于去年十月才单独建立起来，因不少干部轻视税收工作，致使工作不能顺利开展。有些从政府民政合作部门调来的干部，认为税务部门工作是单纯的向群众要钱，不能组织群众生产。银行工作能给群众贷款，而税务工作要钱多，将来会形成群众不满。沙河县税务局长因怕群众反对，不敢说“税务局”三个字，也有的认为税务局不是重要工作，做税务工作的不是好干部等错误说法。更有的认为领导上调他做税务工作是捉他“大头”，因此情绪十分不安。从财政部门调来的干部虽然较好些，但也常常担心领导上不重视他们，使自己工作孤立，没地位没前途。甚至还有的同志把保护工商业发展税收的政策，认为是恢复苛捐杂税等。针对以上诸问题，会中首先由领导上将新民主主义的税收政策及其目的和重要性加以详细的说明，大家经过一天多的酝酿讨论，在思想上初步认识了税收工作在保护发展新民主主义的经济，与支援战争上，有相当重要的作用。它是发展有益于国民生计及限制无益于国民生计的工商业中不可缺少的部分，并不是单纯的要钱工作。由于有了正确认识，解决了很多糊涂思想，便逐渐安定了大家情绪。这个会上并讨论了贯彻税收政策的具体办法及任务，大家认为税收工作方针应有群众路线，一方面依靠税收机关进行，但也需组织群众缉私、防止漏税等现象。最后大家认为整顿好机构，健全干部配备是完成任务的重要保证。散会时大家的情绪显然不同，一致感到对经济政策及税收政策知识缺乏，要求领导上印一些业务学习材料，便于提高工作。（分社按：经济部门同样和其他部门一样，应遵照中共华北中央局对在职干部的学习决定，加强每个干部的理论修养，太行税务总局召开专、县局长会议中，干部所暴露的糊涂思想，即充分说明了干部对新民主主义经济还缺乏起码的理解，这应引起严重重视。）
