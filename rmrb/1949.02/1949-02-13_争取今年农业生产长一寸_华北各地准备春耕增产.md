　　Strive for an Inch More in This Year's Agricultural Production
  　Various Regions in North China Prepare for Spring Plowing to Increase Production
    [Special Dispatch from This Newspaper] Rural production in North China in January is preparing fully for this year's agricultural production increase, especially the upcoming spring plowing campaign. The first step is to solve the labor shortage problem. According to last year's survey, the labor force in the entire Ji'nan area decreased by one-third compared to before the war. Before the incident, full laborers accounted for 55% of the population, while now they only account for about 37%. Other areas are roughly the same. Before the war, an average full laborer cultivated 10 to 16 mu of land, while now, an average full laborer has to burden 20 to 30 mu of land, leading to rough cultivation and reduced production. To overcome this difficulty, various regions are conducting investigations and research, preparing to extensively carry out labor mutual aid and mobilize women to participate in major agricultural labor. Statistics from the five special districts of Ji'nan show that there are 227,200 young and middle-aged women. This year, it is required to organize one-third of these young and middle-aged women to participate in agricultural production. Assuming two women equal one male full laborer, this can increase the labor force by 37,866 full laborers, ensuring timely cultivation and four rounds of weeding. Livestock is also extremely lacking. According to last year's survey, the entire area is on average 40% to 50% short compared to before the war. Taihang, Taiyue, Ji'nan, and Beiyue regions have begun to implement measures to breed and protect livestock. The Taiyue region estimates that 4,000 young livestock will be able to start production this year. However, most still need to be purchased from pastoral areas. To meet the needs of spring plowing, various regions are planning to purchase livestock from pastoral areas. According to statistics from 375 administrative villages in 14 counties in Taihang, 4,677 heads of livestock had been added by January. They were able to increase livestock purchases mainly due to the development of sideline production. According to statistics from 21 villages in Changzhi, Zanhuang, Shahe, and Licheng counties, sideline production income was used to buy back 41 heads of livestock. Taiyue transported local products to exchange for 2,333 heads of livestock. Other areas such as Jinzhong, Jidong, and parts of Beiyue have also seen increases in livestock.
    Secondly, is accumulating fertilizer. According to last year's statistics, the entire area reduced fertilizer by 20% to 50% compared to before the war. For example, in the Taiyue area, the average fertilizer application per mu before the war was about 50 dan, while last year it was about 25 dan per mu. This year, the first special district plans to increase the average fertilizer application for dry land to 30 dan per mu. As of January, according to a survey of 24 villages in Qinshui County, the accumulated fertilizer averaged 22 dan per mu, reaching 75% of the plan. In the second district of Huo County, the plan was to apply 70 dan of manure per mu to paddy fields. In January, an average of 40 dan per mu was completed, reaching 60% of the plan. According to the situation in Changzi, Huo County, Tunliu, and Qin County, it is estimated that with further efforts in February, the plan may be completed. Fertilizer accumulation in most areas of the Ji'nan area has progressed, with the fourth special district being the best. Cadres at all levels have adopted the method of selecting experienced local fertilizer accumulation experts to introduce fertilizer accumulation experience to the masses. Taiyue Yicheng and other places held conferences to reward fertilizer accumulation models to promote everyone to make plans for fertilizer accumulation, breaking the view of some cadres that manure cannot be composted in winter. Taihang, Beiyue, and Jizhong are planning to support oil mills, purchase oil cakes, and accumulate fertilizer.
    Thirdly, repairing and procuring agricultural implements has become a widespread demand of farmers. According to statistics from various places, the entire area lacks one-third to two-thirds of agricultural implements compared to before the war. This work is done better in the Taiyue area. In January, various counties are actively preparing agricultural implement manufacturing plants, combining agricultural loans to solve the shortage of agricultural implements. Currently, Fushan, Qinshui, Yicheng, Yangcheng and other counties have begun to produce finished products. The Fushan Minyi Cooperative Iron Furnace alone can produce 350 jin of goods per day, having already cast 450 plowshares. Before spring plowing, it plans to cast 5,000 plowshares, 20 waterwheels, and 2,500 sets of tooth harrows. The Yangcheng County government supported the restoration of 14 iron furnaces in Anyang Village, which produced more than 237,800 agricultural implements in 40 days. The output of iron furnaces in Gaoping is quite large, supplying agricultural implements to farmers in the Hebei Plain and Henan and other places. Many iron merchants from various places come to order goods. The Renjiakeng iron goods in Ji'nan Hengshui are also actively shipping goods. The Jizhong Zhaoxian Promotion Agency purchased scrap iron to supply iron furnaces, and has manufactured 150 waterwheels, as well as a large number of water buckets. Dingxian Sanlili Village newly purchased 20 waterwheels, plus the existing 77 waterwheels, has turned the entire village's land into irrigated land. However, currently, iron furnaces in various places, especially in the plains, have experienced a shortage of coal and iron. Various places should find ways to quickly solve this problem.
    Fourthly, is to continue leading farmers in disaster areas to overcome the spring famine and prepare for spring plowing. In Anxin and Anping areas of Jizhong, supply and marketing are being vigorously organized, sideline production is being developed, and relief is being combined to enable farmers to prepare food for spring plowing. In Chicheng, Fuping and other places in Beiyue, to prevent the spring famine, production such as organizing sports, collecting firewood, and hunting are being actively organized. Most villages in Fuping have realized the slogan of "not eating autumn grain in winter", preparing food for overcoming the spring famine and carrying out spring plowing.
    In addition, Taihang, Taiyue, Ji'nan and other regions and their respective special districts and counties have conducted investigations and research on the agricultural situation. From solving the labor shortage, mobilizing women to participate in agricultural production, increasing livestock, increasing fertilizer application, supplementing agricultural implements, repairing water conservancy, and advocating the planting of special crops such as cotton and peanuts, concrete plans for increasing production in 1949 have been made. The Jizhong Zhaoxian Promotion Agency has also purchased 150,000 jin of high-quality cotton seeds, preparing to promote them. Manure has already begun to be delivered to mountainous areas, and 20% of the land in Quyang County, Beiyue area has been manured. The plain areas should also break the old habit of delivering manure only when cultivating the land, delivering manure in advance, so that when spring plowing and sowing, we can concentrate our efforts, cultivate carefully and meticulously.
    However, the preparation for spring plowing has not yet reached a very widespread high point. February is even closer to spring plowing, and time waits for no one. It is hoped that cadres and masses in the entire area will strive with all their strength to complete this year's production increase by an inch.

　　争取今年农业生产长一寸
  　华北各地准备春耕增产
    【本报特讯】华北一月份农村生产，为进一步给今年农业增产，特别是即将到来的春耕运动，准备充分的条件。首先是解决劳动力问题，根据去年调查，冀南全区劳动力比战前减少三分之一，即事变前全劳力占人口百分之五十五，而现在全劳力只占人口百分之卅七左右，其它地区亦大致相同。战前一个全劳力耕种土地平均十亩至十六亩上下，而现在则平均一个全劳力要负担耕地廿至三十亩上下，以致耕作粗糙减产。为了克服这一困难，各地区正在调查研究，准备广泛的开展劳动互助，与发动妇女参加农业主要劳动。翼南五专区统计有青壮年妇女二十二万七千二百人，今年要求组织青壮年妇女的三分之一参加农业生产，按两个妇女顶一个男全劳力计，即可增加三万七千八百六十六个全劳力，就能保证耕作及时、地锄四遍。至于畜力，亦极缺乏，据去年调查，全区平均比战前缺少百分之四十到五十。太行、太岳、冀南、北岳等区已着手实施繁殖保护牲畜的措施，太岳区估计今年即有四千头小畜可以开始生产。但大部分尚须从牧畜地区购入。为了解决春耕的需要，各地正有计划地往牧畜地区购买牲畜，据太行十四个县三百七十五个行政村的统计，至一月已增买了牲口四千六百七十七头。他们能增购牲口，主要是由于开展了副业生产，据长治、赞皇、沙河、黎城四县的二十一个村统计，用副业生产所得买回的牲口，即达四十一头。太岳运出土产换回牲口二千三百三十三头。其它晋中、冀东、北岳部分县的牲畜亦有增加。
    其次是积肥，据去年统计，全区比战前减少肥料百分之二十至五十。如太岳区战前每亩平均施肥为五十担左右，去年则为每亩平均二十五担左右，今年一专区计划旱地每亩平均施肥增至三十担。到一月间，据沁水县二十四个村调查，已积之肥每亩平均可达二十二担，达到计划的百分之七十五。霍县二区水地每亩计划上粪七十担，一月间完成平均每亩四十担，达到计划的百分之六十。根据长子、霍县、屯留、沁县情况，估计二月份再加努力突击，可能完成计划。冀南区积肥大部地区有进展，以四专区为最好。各级干部采取选择当地有经验的积肥能手，向群众介绍积肥经验，太岳翼城等地则召集大会，奖励积肥模范，来推动大家订计划积肥。打破了某些干部认为冬天不能沤粪的观点。太行、北岳、冀中等地，正有计划的扶助油坊，收买油饼，积存肥料。
    第三是修置农具，已成为当前农民普遍要求，据各地统计，全区农具比战前缺少三分之一至三分之二。此一工作以太岳区做的较好，一月间各县都在积极筹备农具制造厂，结合农贷解决农具缺少困难，现浮山、沁水、翼城、阳城等县已开始制出成品，仅浮山县民益合作铁炉，每天可出货三百五十斤，已铸出犁铧四百五十个，春耕前准备铸犁铧五千个，水车二十辆、齿耙二千五百付。阳城县府扶助安阳村恢复铁货炉十四个，四十天即出农具二十三万七千八百余件，高平铁货炉产量颇大，供应了河北平原与河南等地农民农具，各地铁商前往定货者甚多。冀南衡水任家坑铁货也在积极出货，冀中赵县推进社收买废铁，供给铁炉，已制成水车一百五十架，还制了大批水斗子，定县三十里村新买水车二十架，加上旧有水车七十七架，已使全村土地变为水浇地。但目前各地铁货炉、尤其在平原里已发生了缺乏煤铁现象，各地应设法迅速解决这一问题。
    第四是继续领导灾区农民渡过春荒，准备春耕，冀中安新、安平一带，正大力组织供销，开展副业生产，结合赈济，使农民准备春耕食粮，北岳赤城、阜平等地为了防止春荒，正积极组织运动、打柴、打猎等生产。阜平大部村庄已实现了“冬天不吃秋天粮”的口号，准备下渡过春荒进行春耕的食粮。
    此外，太行、太岳、冀南等区及所属各专区、县已进行了农业情况的调查研究，从解决劳力困难，发动妇女参加农业生产，增加牲畜，增加施肥量，补充农具，修浚水利，提倡植棉种花生等特种作物等方面，做出了一九四九年增加生产的具体计划。冀中赵县推进社并已收买优良棉种十五万斤，准备推广。现在山地均已开始送粪，北岳区曲阳县十分之二的土地已送上粪。平原地区亦应打破耕地才送粪的旧习，提前送粪，以便春耕播种时，能集中力量，精耕细作。
    但准备春耕工作，仍未到达极普遍的高潮点，二月更逼近春耕，时不我待，望全区干部群众全力为完成今年生产长一寸而奋斗。
