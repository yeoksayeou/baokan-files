　　The Taihang Sixth Prefectural Committee's Experience in Mobilizing Cadres for External Transfer
    Taihang Sixth Prefectural Committee Propaganda Department
    Due to the rapid development of the revolutionary situation, mobilizing a large number of outstanding cadres to work in newly liberated areas is an important task at present. After years of training and nurturing by the Party, the majority of our region's cadres have improved their awareness and are able to happily obey the Party's assignments and transfers. However, there are also some cadres who, due to insufficient ideological preparation, have not been able to fully comply with the Party's transfers. In order to smoothly mobilize cadres to prepare to go south to liberate the provinces of Jiangnan, the counties of the Taihang Sixth Prefectural Committee have successively and conscientiously carried out the work of clearing cadres' thinking. According to preliminary understanding, the problems have been well resolved, and significant results have been achieved.

    The main experiences gained by the counties in clearing up thoughts on external transfer are as follows:

    1.  Conduct systematic education on current events and the future, and encourage everyone's mood with the imminent final victory, to overcome the fatigue of some comrades caused by the long-term war. Doing so will naturally make cadres cherish their glorious history of struggle and continue to serve the people, rather than be content to lag behind and fall behind in the face of the impending final victory.

    2.  Conduct organizational education for Communist Party members and revolutionary cadres, and enlighten their thinking of obeying the organization and fighting to the end for the revolution. The vast majority of our cadres have turned themselves around under the leadership of the Party, and they have been cultivated and promoted in the struggle. They have deep feelings for the Party, as can be seen from the recollections of past suffering and the current happiness expressed by many comrades in their speeches, revealing an indescribable love for the Party. What they lack is the insufficient awareness of proletarian vanguard fighters, and their thinking still remains at the level of liberated peasants. Therefore, they have the erroneous idea of not wanting to leave their homes, and they do not understand that the reason why Party members and cadres are glorious and great is that they can sacrifice their personal interests and obey the interests of the revolution, and they do not understand that only the complete victory of the revolution can make their happiness reliable and possible to improve. After conducting the above education, their awareness has been improved, and they consciously obey the organization. For example, after studying the Party Constitution in the Party School, many comrades happily said: "We didn't understand this in the past, but this time we finally understand!"

    3.  Systematically and consciously explain the political and natural environment of the South, and the favorable conditions for us, such as the prosperity of life, the emptiness of the enemy, and the people's anticipation of us, to dispel some comrades' unnecessary concerns. This point seems to be a non-fundamental issue compared to the former, but many people often think about this point, so it must also be resolved.

    4.  Unite activists and carry out enlightenment and education work. First, the group should deliberate, and then go to the general assembly for collective discussion. Under the leadership's leading attitude and typical enlightenment, a heated debate will unfold. Many speeches sufficient to clear up the cadres' thoughts will naturally be generated in the discussion. With mutual enlightenment and encouragement from above and below, those who are active are praised and become more active; those who are hesitant are moved by everyone's emotions and become firm; and the few who are not yet aware gradually become conscious under everyone's enlightenment. (Many people submitted notes after the Shahe meeting to express their attitude, which is one example).

    The comrades' awareness has been improved, but it cannot be considered all is well, because many comrades' thoughts often change; at the same time, new problems may arise after the solved problems, so consolidating everyone's existing progress and improving it is still a work that cannot be ignored. In addition, after this mobilization education, some comrades are not at ease with their current work, but are waiting for transfer (this is inevitable and not terrible), resulting in the relaxation of current work and losses. Therefore, it is still necessary to continue to overcome this kind of thinking.

　　太行六地委动员干部外调经验
    太行六地委宣传部
    由于革命形势迅速的发展，调动大批优秀干部到新区工作，是当前一件重要的任务。我区干部经过党多年的培养与锻炼，大部觉悟是提高了的，均能愉快的服从党的分配与调动。但是也有部分干部，曾经因思想准备不足，未能圆满的服从党的调动。为顺利动员干部准备南下，以解放江南诸省，太行六地委区各县，均先后认真进行了打通干部思想的工作。据初步了解，解决的均很好，并且取得了显著的成绩。
    在打通外调思想中，各县获得的经验主要有这样几点：
    一、进行系统的时事，前途教育，用即将到来的最后胜利，鼓舞大家的心情，克服若干同志因长期战争所滋生的疲倦情绪。这样做，很自然的会使干部宝贵自己光荣斗争历史的思想，继续为人民服务，而不甘心在即将最后胜利的面前落后和掉队。
    二、进行共产党员革命干部的组织教育，启发其服从组织，革命奋斗到底的思想。我们绝大部分干部都是在党的领导下翻了身，而且是斗争中培养提拔出来的，他们和党都有着深厚的感情。如许多同志在发言中回忆过去的痛苦，看看现在的快乐，对党流露出难以形容的热爱，就可说明这一点。他们所欠缺的，就是无产阶级先锋战士的觉悟不足，思想还停留在翻身农民的水平。因而有舍不得家的错误思想，不了解党员干部之所以光荣伟大，正是能够牺牲个人的利益，服从革命的利益，不了解只有革命的彻底胜利，自己的幸福才可靠和才有可能提高。进行上述教育后，他们的觉悟提高了，自觉的服从组织。如：党校学习党章这一段后，许多同志高兴的说：“过去咱就不了解这，这次才打通呀！”
    三、系统的有意识的讲解南方的政治自然环境，对我们有利的条件，如生活富庶、敌人空虚、人心盼我等，以解除若干同志不必要的顾虑。这一点较之前者似非基本问题，但许多人都常在这一点上作思考，因而也必须解决。
    四、团结积极分子，进行启发和教育的工作，先由小组酝酿，再走上大会集体讨论，在领导上带头表示态度和典型启发下，就会展开热烈的争论。讨论中自会产生许多足以打通干部思想的发言。在上下相互启发与鼓励下，积极的受到了赞扬，则更积极；犹豫未决的为大家的情绪感动而得到坚定；少数尚未觉悟的，在大家启发下也逐渐走向了自觉。（沙河会后许多人递条表示态度即其一例）。
    同志们的觉悟已经提高了，但还不能认为百事大吉，因为许多同志的思想常常会发生变化的；同时已解决的还可能发生新问题，因此巩固大家已有的进步并加以提高，仍是不能忽视的工作。此外在这次动员教育后，部分同志不安心当前的工作，而在等待调动（这是必然的不可怕），致使目前工作放松而受损失。因此仍需继续克服这种思想。
