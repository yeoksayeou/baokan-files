[Jinan Telegram] Since the Linqing incident, the Administrative Office has issued emergency measures to stabilize commodity prices, which has aroused serious attention from the Party and government leaders and economic departments throughout the region. In order to strengthen the leading role of the state-owned economy, a widespread study of the Xinhua News Agency's editorial "The Linqing Incident and State-Owned Commerce" has been launched, combined with an inspection to curb speculation, panic buying, and hoarding. In the past half month, preliminary results have been achieved in various places. The Trade and Jianhua companies have gathered responsible cadres from their affiliated system of general and branch stores to check discipline, overcome the purely profit-seeking viewpoint and the disorganized state of lack of unified leadership and coordination in management. In particular, the minds of economic cadres have been sobered, and they have realized that in the past, they did not have enough understanding of the speculative and destructive nature of private commercial capital, which led to them being exploited. Subsequently, the Industry and Commerce Department of the Administrative Office, in cooperation with the Weixian Industry and Commerce Section, conducted an inspection of the operation of industry and commerce and market management in Weixian Chengguan at the end of last month. In addition to discovering chaotic phenomena such as state-owned stores abandoning market leadership, banks blindly granting loans, public institutions speculating with each other in production, and colluding with private merchants to sell public grain allocation slips, there was also a lack of unified strength and overall concept in implementing emergency measures to stabilize commodity prices. For example, in Yutaihao's (state-owned) grain sales, a lot of grain ended up in the hands of private merchants, allowing them to speculate and profit. Some private merchants also took the opportunity to hoard, such as Guanghua Store, which purchased and stored more than 40 *shi* of wheat, while the majority of citizens could not buy it. After clarifying the above circumstances, in order to strengthen discipline, strictly enforce administrative management, and protect the interests of small producers and legitimate industrial and commercial operators, the government has given different punishments to all public and private stores' illegal acts according to the severity of the circumstances. The profits from the illegal sale of allocation slips by the Yitonghualian Grain Store and the Yongsheng Tobacco Company for organ production were confiscated and turned over to the public. The directly affiliated business department of the public Jianhua Company was ordered to stop its intermediate turnover; Qi Zimei, a private merchant who has consistently speculated in the reselling of allocation slips, was forced to return the 125,000 yuan (People's Currency) of illicit profits. The grain hoarded by Liangji and Guanghua was ordered to be auctioned to state-owned stores, and a city-wide merchant and resident conference was convened to announce and explain the harm of the above-mentioned illegal business to production and commodity prices, calling on private merchants to engage in legitimate commerce in the future, and to supervise and report hoarding elements who speculate and disrupt the market. The counties in the Third Special District promptly stopped the speculative hoarding phenomenon, and commodity prices gradually declined and stabilized. Quzhou, Guangping and other counties also successively stopped the speculative activities of merchants and sold grain to the poor people at low prices. Jize and Yongnian Production Promotion Cooperatives sold grain to the masses in exchange for native cloth and other items, so the commodity prices in various counties have gradually decreased and stabilized. At present, economic department cadres in various counties are continuing to study the editorial "The Linqing Incident and State-Owned Commerce," combined with further inspection and improvement work.

　　制止投机非法活动
  　冀南加强市场管理
    各经济部门热烈展开政策学习
    【冀南电】自临清事件发生后，行署颁布对平稳物价的紧急措施，引起全区党、政领导客关及经济部门的严重注意，为加强国营经济的领导作用，普遍展开对新华社“临清事件与国营商业”社论的学习，结合检查制止投机抢购囤积现象，稳定物价，半月来各地均获得初步成绩，贸易、建华两公司集合所属系统之总、分支店负责干部检查纪律，克服单纯营利观点与经营上缺乏统一领导缺乏配合的无组织状态，特别是清醒了经济干部的头脑，认识了过去对私营商业资本的投机性破坏性认识不足以至被利用。随后，行署工商处配合威县工商科于上月底对威县城关工商业经营与市场管理进行了检查，除发现过去国营商店放弃市场领导，银行盲目贷款，公营机关生产相互投机，串通私商卖公粮划拨书等混乱现象外，在贯彻平稳物价的紧急措施上，也缺乏统一力量和整体观念，如裕泰号（国营）卖粮，不少粮食跑到私商手里，任其投机渔利。还有的私商趁机囤积，如光华商店购存麦子四十余石，而广大市民却买不到手里。查明上述情节后，政府为加强纪律，严格行政管理，保护小生产者及正当工商业者的利益，特对一切公私商店的违法行为分别轻重予以处分。对机关生产的义同花粮店，永生烟草公司倒卖划拨书所得之利润，一概没收归公，对公营建华公司直属营业部停止其住成机交；对一贯投机倒卖划拨书的私商齐子美追回其渔利十二万五千元（人民币）。亮记、光华的囤粮均令其拍卖给国营商店，并召开全城商民大会宣布，说明以上不法营业对生产及物价的危害，号召私商今后要经营正当的商业，监督与检举投机捣乱市场的囤积分子。三专区各县及时制止了投机囤积现象，物价渐趋下降和稳定。曲周、广平等县也先后制止了商贩的投机行为，把粮食低价售予贫苦民众。鸡泽、永年生产推进社卖给群众粮食，换回土布及其他物品，因此目前各县物价已逐渐下降和稳定。现各县经济部门干部正继续学习“临清事件与国营商业”的社论，结合着进一步的检查改进工作。
