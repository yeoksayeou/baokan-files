　　The Khural of the Mongolian Republic

　　The political structure of the Mongolian People's Republic employs democratic centralism. The highest organ of power in the country is the Great Khural, also known as the Supreme People's Assembly. Representatives attending the Great Khural are elected from the representatives of the aimag (tribal) khurals and the capital khural. According to the constitution, the Great Khural convenes once every three years. During the recess of the Great Khural, the highest organ of power is the Small Khural, which is elected by the Great Khural. The Small Khural elects a seven-member Presidium, which is the highest organ of power during the recess of the Small Khural. The Council of Ministers, which handles the regular administrative affairs of the government, is responsible to the Presidium of the Small Khural, or to the Small Khural or Great Khural during meetings. The Council of Ministers includes ministries of the Chairman, Vice-Chairman, Foreign Affairs, Armed Forces, Animal Husbandry, Labor, Transportation, Commerce, Finance, Internal Affairs, Education, Justice, and Health.
