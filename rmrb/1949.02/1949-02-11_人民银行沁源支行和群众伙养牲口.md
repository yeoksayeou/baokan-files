　　People's Bank of Qinshui Branch
　　and the Masses Collectively Raising Livestock
　　[Taiyue Telegram] The People's Bank of Qinshui Branch and the masses collectively raise livestock, resulting in a high breeding rate. In some villages in the northern part of the Fifth District of Qinshui, which were long-term guerrilla zones before the liberation of Pingyao and Jiexiu, the masses suffered severe losses and damage to their livestock and farm implements due to countless "mopping-up" operations by the Japanese invaders and the Yan bandit troops over the past seven or eight years. For example, Yangfeng Village lost all forty-two livestock to the enemy. Last winter, when issuing winter loans, the masses, based on the excellent conditions for developing animal husbandry in the area, were willing to jointly raise livestock with the bank. Their method is as follows: Based on the purchase price of the livestock, the bank provides half, and the masses who do not use the livestock provide the other half, and are responsible for the care and feeding. If foals and calves are born, the bank subsidizes the feed and half of the breeding costs. In the future, when the young livestock grow up, the ownership will be split equally. In this way, the masses can raise two livestock with the money for buying one. The wide slopes and abundant grass in the mountains are used specifically for raising female livestock to produce more foals. Many livestock have been added to the villages since last winter. Yangfeng Village alone added twenty livestock, which is very welcomed by the masses.

　　人民银行沁源支行
  　和群众伙养牲口
    【太岳电】中国人民银行沁源支行，和群众伙养牲口，繁殖率大。沁源五区北部某些村庄，在平遥、介休解放以前，长期地是游击区，七八年来，经过日寇、阎匪无数次的清剿扫荡，群众牲口、农具损失破坏很厉害。如阳凤全村四十二个牲口，被敌人抢得一个也没有了。去冬发放冬季贷款时，群众根据当地能发展畜牧的优良条件，愿和银行伙养牲口。他们的办法是：按牲口买价，银行出一半，不使用牲口、群众出一半，管使管养，如果生下小驹和牛犊时，银行贴料，同时贴一半配种的花费，将来小畜养大，还是一家一半。这样，群众用买一个牲口的钱，就可养两个牲口，山上坡宽草多，就专养母牲口，多生小驹。各村去冬就增添了很多牲口，光阳凤村，就增加了二十个牲口，群众很欢迎这个办法。
