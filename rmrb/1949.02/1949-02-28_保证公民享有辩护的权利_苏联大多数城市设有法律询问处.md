　　Guaranteeing Citizens' Right to Defense
  　Most Soviet Cities Have Legal Advice Offices
    [Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 25th] TASS reports: In the Soviet judicial system, providing legal advice to the people is considered to be of great significance. Article 111 of the Soviet Constitution guarantees every citizen the right to defense. Most Soviet cities have established bar associations. These associations also have legal advice offices where people can obtain explanatory references and knowledge about current laws, or opinions on any legal issues or court affairs. Legal advice offices can also fulfill the wishes of those who inquire about selecting a defense lawyer; inquiry fees are based on uniform regulations of the Ministry of Justice. On issues concerning the receipt of pensions and the enjoyment of specific rights by active-duty military personnel and veterans, legal advice offices provide them with free legal consultation.
    Moscow has about a thousand lawyers. Each district of Moscow has a legal advice office, and about 200,000 people visit these legal advice offices each year. The All-Union Central Council of Trade Unions has established legal advice offices in enterprises in Moscow, Leningrad, Kiev, Voronezh, Kharkov, Dnepropetrovsk, and other cities to serve workers.

　　保证公民享有辩护的权利
  　苏联大多数城市设有法律询问处
    【新华社陕北二十五日电】塔斯社讯：在苏维埃司法制度中，对人民提供法律上的意见，是被认为有重大意义的。苏联宪法第一一一条保证每一公民都享有辩护的权利。苏联大多数城市都已设有律师学会。这些学会并设有法律询问处，人民可从那里得到关于现行法律的解释性的参考意见与知识，或者关于任何法律问题或法院事务上的意见。法律询问处也可以满足那些为选择辩护律师而提出询问的人们底愿望，询问费以司法部的统一规定为基础。在关于现役军人和荣誉军人领取抚恤金和享受特定权利的问题上，法律询问处就免费供给他们以法律上的咨询性意见。
    莫斯科约有一千名律师。莫斯科每一区都设有一个法律询问处，每年到这些法律询问处去问事的约有二十万人。苏联职工会中央委员会在莫斯科、列宁格勒、基辅、伏罗内兹、哈尔科夫、聂伯彼得罗夫斯克及其他城市的企业中，都设有法律询问处，为工人服务。
