On the Issue of Folk Remedies

"Folk remedies cure goiter," "A single remedy, used alone, enrages famous doctors." These two sayings are commonly circulated in rural areas. Why are folk remedies and single remedies so widely supported by the masses? It is certainly not accidental: First, the medicines used are simple and easy to find. Second, they are cheap. Third, the methods are simple, and they have a certain efficacy.

Especially in our past old medical circles, they mostly served the wealthy, and general medicine was mostly concentrated in cities, resulting in an excess of medicine in cities and a lack of medicine in rural areas, causing many poor farmers to seek single remedies to relieve the pain of illness.

Precisely because of this, some people who possess "folk remedies" take advantage of this to hoard them, not only not passing them on to others, but even "passing them on to sons but not to daughters." Some say: "I'd rather take it to the grave than pass it on to others." Because of these reasons, some valuable folk remedies cannot be widely circulated, and are even lost.

Today, our New Democratic society is under construction, and medical difficulties are temporarily unavoidable. These folk remedies can still be promoted and used during a certain period.

However, these folk remedies are mostly empirical formulas and have not been scientifically tested and researched. If used improperly, many people's lives are also endangered. It is hoped that the relevant health departments in various regions will make an appropriate plan, use the existing medical organizations, and combine traditional Chinese and Western medicine to specifically collect, research, analyze, and experiment, to find the correct application methods for folk remedies, and then introduce them to the broad masses. This will help to temporarily solve the difficulty of buying medicine in rural areas.

### 关于偏方问题

　　关于偏方问题
    “偏方治大脖，“单方一味，气死名医”，这两句话是在农村普遍流行的。为什么偏方、单方这样受到广泛群众的拥护？当然不是偶然的：第一、应用的药物简单易寻。第二、价钱便宜。第三、方法简单，有它一定的功效。
    尤其我国过去旧医药界多为有钱人服务，一般医药多集中在城市，形成城市医药过多，而乡村医药缺少，致使许多贫困的农民不能不求之单方，解除疾病痛苦。
    正因为如此，有些藏有“偏方”的人便借以居奇，不但不传给旁人，有的甚至“传儿子不传闺女”。有的说：“我宁带进棺材去，也不传给人。”由于这些原因，使得有些宝贵的偏方不能普遍流传，甚至失传。
    今天我们的新民主主义社会正在建设过程，医药困难一时还不可免。这种偏方在一定的时期还可以推广运用。
    但是这种偏方多属经验方，未经过科学化验研究。用的不当，遗误人命也是不少，希望各地有关卫生部门作一个适当的计划，利用现有医药界的组织，使中西医相互结合，去专门搜集、研究、分析、实验，求得对偏方的正确应用方法后，再介绍给广大群众，这对目前临时解决农村买药困难，是会有帮助的。
