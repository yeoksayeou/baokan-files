Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 11th. When the heartless Kuomintang bandit gang fled from Nanjing to Guangzhou, they abandoned a large number of mid- and low-level civil servants and refugee students. Many civil servants had worked in the Kuomintang government agencies for decades with meager salaries, but the pseudo-Premier Sun Ke and a group of pseudo-ministers didn't even give them any severance pay before abandoning them. The civil servants hated those war criminals who fled south. Publicly funded students in Nanjing universities have had their subsidies stopped, and a large number of refugee students are in desperate situations without food or housing. On the 2nd, six thousand refugee students from Anhui Province sent representatives to petition the pseudo-Acting President Li Zongren. The students crowded in front of the pseudo-Presidential Palace all day, but to no avail. On the 7th, the Nanjing Kuomintang military and police authorities, on the contrary, arrested and killed refugee students on the charge of "disrupting social order."

　　国民党匪帮逃向广州时
  　南京大批公务员和学生被弃处境悲惨
    【新华社陕北十一日电】狠心的国民党匪帮由南京逃向广州时，将大批中下级公务人员及流亡学生弃置不顾。不少公务员在国民党政府机关中在不足糊口的薪水待遇下工作了数十年之久，但伪行政院长孙科和一群伪部长们连一点遣散费也不发给就把他们丢开了。公务员们恨死了那些南逃的战争罪犯们。南京各大学校中的公费生已被停止发给补助费，大量流亡学生因得不到补助而陷于无食无住的绝境。二日六千名安徽籍的流亡学生曾派代表向伪代总统李宗仁请愿，学生们整日拥挤在伪总统府门前，但毫无结果。七日南京国民党军警当局反以“扰乱社会秩序”罪名，捕杀流亡学生。
