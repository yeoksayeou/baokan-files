Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, February 8th: Comprehensive TASS report: On February 1st, when the British military court illegally sentenced Lehmann, Chairman of the Executive Committee of the West German Communist Party, who resolutely fought for the democratic independence of Germany, to three months in prison, it immediately aroused deep anger and protest among the German people. After the verdict was announced, a large number of people in Düsseldorf attempted to break through the police cordon and enter the court to protest. However, the military authorities mobilized thousands of British and German police to prevent them. Nevertheless, slogans of "Release Lehmann" were posted throughout the city. In the Soviet-occupied zone of Saxony-Anhalt, over 15,000 workers held a large protest rally. The news of Lehmann's imprisonment ignited a storm of anger among workers in various factories in Greater Berlin, who passed many resolutions protesting this illegal verdict and demanding his immediate release. The Executive Committee of the Communist Party of North Rhine-Westphalia in the British occupation zone and the Hamburg organization of the German Communist Party both issued protest statements, announcing that they would fight to restore Lehmann's freedom. The United Front Joint Committee of West German anti-fascist democratic parties unanimously passed a declaration, sharply protesting the illegal verdict against Lehmann. The declaration pointed out that Lehmann was sentenced to imprisonment for the national interests of the German people. The declaration demanded Lehmann's immediate release, and called on all German people to continue to fight vigorously for German unity and a just peace. Wilhelm Pieck and Otto Grotewohl, Chairmen of the Socialist Unity Party of Germany, sent a telegram to Lehmann on behalf of the Central Committee of the Socialist Unity Party, expressing their support for his struggle to defend the national interests of the German people and oppose the "Ruhr Statute" and traitors, and demanding Lehmann's immediate release.
