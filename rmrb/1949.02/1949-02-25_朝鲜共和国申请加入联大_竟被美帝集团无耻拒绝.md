Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 23rd. Reports from various sources: On February 15th and 16th, the United Nations Security Council discussed the applications of the Korean People's Democratic Republic and the South Korean puppet "government" to join the United Nations. The purpose of the Korean People's Democratic Republic government's application to join the United Nations is clearly stated in its application: to represent the will of the Korean people and express its willingness to cooperate with other peace-loving countries to maintain peace and international security. The South Korean puppet "government's" application to join the United Nations was directed by the United States, attempting to "consolidate the position of the South Korean reactionary puppet government to some extent" (TASS). At the Security Council, Soviet representative Malik fully exposed the consistent conspiracy of American imperialism to split Korea and turn South Korea into its colony. However, with the help of the American bloc's "voting machine," the Security Council refused to submit the application of the Korean People's Democratic Republic to the Membership Committee for discussion, and passed the submission of the South Korean puppet country's application to the committee for discussion. After the vote, Malik, representing the Soviet delegation, issued a statement denouncing this as the second unjust act committed by the Anglo-American bloc against the Korean people in the Security Council. The first was the rejection of the participation of the representatives of the Korean People's Democratic Republic when the United Nations Paris Conference discussed the Korean question.

　　朝鲜共和国申请加入联大
  　竟被美帝集团无耻拒绝
    【新华社陕北二十三日电】各方报导：二月十五日和十六日，联合国安理会讨论了朝鲜人民民主共和国和南朝鲜傀儡“政府”申请加入联合国问题。朝鲜人民民主共和国政府申请加入联合国的目的，在其申请书上写得很明白：是代表朝鲜人民的意志，表示愿与其他爱好和平的国家合作，以维持和平与国际安全。南朝鲜傀儡“政府”申请加入联合国，则是受美国指使，企图借此“在某种程度上巩固南朝鲜反动傀儡政府的地位”（塔斯社）。在安理会上，苏联代表马立克曾尽情揭露了美国帝国主义分裂朝鲜与变南朝鲜为其殖民地的一贯阴谋。然而，由于美国集团借“表决机器”之助，拒绝将朝鲜人民民主共和国的申请书提交安理会之会籍委员会讨论。并通过将南朝鲜傀儡国的申请书提交该委员会讨论。投票后，马立克代表苏联代表团发表声明，斥责这是美英集团在安理会上对朝鲜民族所作的第二次非正义行为。第一次为联合国巴黎会议讨论朝鲜问题时，拒绝朝鲜人民民主共和国代表的参加。
