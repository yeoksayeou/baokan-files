　　Preliminary Experiences in Land Measurement Work in Fan County
　　Guo Shaotang

　　The villages of Qian Yu Huang Miao, Hou Yu Huang Miao, Qian Feng Gu, Su Zhuang, Yan Zhuang, and Ge Kou in Fan County have completed the work of measuring land and filling out land certificates in five to ten days, gaining preliminary experience:

　　I. Integrate with various tasks. Before the twelfth lunar month, no village in the county had started land measurement. Most cadres thought that land measurement was too troublesome and could not be completed in ten or twenty days. For example, the work team in Qian and Hou Yu Huang Miao had planned to measure land after the Lunar New Year and only adjust houses and distribute fruit remnants before the new year. However, after studying the resolutions of the county party committee expansion meeting in detail, they realized that adjusting houses, distributing fruit remnants, and measuring land could be done simultaneously. They then convened a mass meeting, and everyone was in high spirits, saying, "It's good to finish it, so as not to delay production in the future." The leadership then adopted a scientific division of labor based on the actual situation of each village, with specialized responsibilities, combining the several tasks of ending land reform with party building and government construction. Generally, they were divided into groups for clearing fruits, adjusting houses, and issuing land certificates. The land certificate issuing group was further divided into four teams: measurement, registration, propaganda, and mediation. In this way, the work was carried out quickly and well. Some villages mechanically divided tasks without combining them according to the actual situation, resulting in prolonged time.

　　II. Self-measurement and spot-checking: Land measurement should first mobilize the masses to conduct self-measurement, especially mobilizing households with "scribes" to participate. After boosting confidence in self-measurement ideologically, it is also necessary to promptly call for free grouping, which is an important step in leading and ensuring that self-measurement does not fall through. At the same time, a reporting and requesting system was established, with group leaders reporting to the measurement team every day, raising experiences and difficulties. Problems that could not be solved were handed over to the mediation team for resolution. Good experiences and model actions should be broadcast throughout the village in a timely manner to influence and motivate everyone. For individual households that do not self-measure, it is necessary to deeply discover their ideological obstacles and solve them. According to the situation in five villages, self-measured land accounts for 60 to 80 percent of the total land in the village. Therefore, without doing a good job in self-measurement, the measurement work cannot be completed smoothly. For example, Qian Feng Gu and Hou Yu Huang Miao villages both grasped self-measurement from the beginning, so both villages measured all the land in the village in five days. Qian Yu Huang Miao did not grasp self-measurement tightly for the first seven days, and only the measurement team was working. In seven days, they only measured more than six *qing* of land, but after mobilizing self-measurement, it was completed in less than three days. Spot-checking is not only a technical job but also a political job for the working masses. Therefore, we should lead the masses to launch support for models, report false and untrue declarations, and carry out mass criticism and self-criticism. Spot-checking should be conducted based on mass opinions, praising the good and criticizing the bad, and implementing the penalties stipulated in the public agreement. Spot-checking is the responsibility of the measurement team. After spot-checking a piece of land, the results must be announced and linked to the public agreement to further promote self-measurement. Land without "scribes" and land that is difficult to measure are the responsibility of the measurement team.

　　III. Convene mass meetings to announce that old documents are all invalid: burn them if you want, keep them if you want. In this way, the masses will not have any ideological fluctuations, and it will not be difficult to produce documents when measuring land, without having to specifically work on their thinking to collect documents.

　　IV. Propaganda and organization in registration work: When filling out land certificates, conduct propaganda and education on economic equality, everyone has a share, equality between men and women, equality between old and young, and anti-feudal ideology. Mobilize the convening of family meetings, and democratically discuss and decide whether to register on the land certificate by household or by individual. In addition, attention must be paid to the issue of personal relationships in the work: for example, when registering in Qian Yu Huang Miao, the person recording saw that the reported information was untrue, put down the pen, and folded his arms and just watched without saying anything. Based on this situation, village cadres or people's representatives must be present for inspection at any time.

　　V. Leadership work: The entire work must be arranged within the branch, inspiring party members to play an exemplary role, especially in opposing feudal ideology and holding family meetings, to mobilize party members to consciously do it, to promote everyone. Secondly, uniting activists and better elements to carry out criticism and self-criticism to ensure no false reports and false measurements, and to actively withdraw over-distributed and over-occupied land, is also a very important point.

　　范县丈量土地工作的初步经验
    郭绍汤
    范县前玉皇庙、后玉皇庙、前冯固、苏庄、阎庄和葛口等村已经在五天至十天的时间内，完成了丈量土地填写土地证的工作，取得初步经验：
    一、和各种工作结合进行。旧历腊月初，全县还没有一个村进行丈量土地。干部中绝大部分认为丈量土地太麻烦，十天二十天完不成，如前后玉皇庙工作组曾计划旧历年后再丈量土地，年前只作调剂房子分果实尾巴等工作，但把县委扩大会议决议详细研究后，认识到把调剂房屋，分果实尾巴与丈量土地等工作同时结合进行是可以完成的。便召开群众大会，大家情绪很高，都说：“做完好，省得以后耽误生产”。领导上便根据各村实际情况，采取了科学分工，专门负责，把结束土改的几个工作结合整党建政同时进行。一般是分成清理果实、调剂房子、发土地证等组。发土地证组下面又分丈量、登记、宣传与调解四股。这样，工作进行得快而好，有些村子机械的划分，不根据实际情形结合进行，结果拖长了时间。
    二、自丈与抽丈：丈量土地要首先发动广大群众进行自丈，特别是要发动有“文书”的户参加。从思想上把自丈的信心发动起来后，还必须及时号召自由结组，这是领导与保证自丈不落空的重要步骤。同时规定了汇报与请示制度，由小组长每天向丈量组汇报，提出经验与困难，不能解决的问题交调解股解决。好经验与模范行动，要及时广播全村，以影响带动大家。对个别不自丈户，要深入发现其思想圪塔，加以解决。据五个村的情形看，自丈土地占全村土地的百分之六十至八十。所以不搞好自丈就不能顺利完成丈量工作。如前冯固、后玉皇庙两村都是一开始就抓紧了自丈，所以两村均在五天丈量了全村土地。前玉皇庙前七天没抓紧自丈，光是丈量组搞，七天中才丈量六顷多地，但发动自丈后，不到三天便完成了。抽丈这不仅是个技术工作，也是个劳动群众的政治工作。因此，应该领导群众，开展拥护模范、检举虚报不实，展开群众性的批评与自我批评，根据群众意见进行抽丈，好的表扬，坏的批评，并执行公约上的处罚。抽丈由丈量组负责。抽丈一块后，一定公布结果，联系公约，进一步推动自丈。没文书的土地和难丈的由丈量组负责丈量。
    三、召开群众大会宣布旧文书一律作废：愿烧就烧，愿存就存。这样，群众思想上便不会有什么波动，丈地时拿出文书便不困难，不用专去打通思想收文书。
    四、登记工作中的宣传组织：在填写土地证时，进行经济平等，人人有一份，男女平等，老少平等，反封建思想的宣传教育，动员召开家庭会议，民主讨论决定是以户还是以人为单位向土地证上登记。另外须注意工作中的情面问题：如前玉皇庙登记时，记帐的人一看报的不实，就把笔一放，袖着手光看不说。根据这个情况，必须有村干或人民代表在场以便随时检查。
    五、领导工作：整个工作都要在支部中进行布置，启发党员起模范作用，特别是在反对封建思想，与开家庭会议中，要发动党员自觉地搞起来，以推动大家。其次，团结积极分子较好分子开展批评与自我批评，保证不虚报虚丈，要主动退出多分多占，这也是很重要的一点。
