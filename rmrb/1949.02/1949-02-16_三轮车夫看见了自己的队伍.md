　　The Rickshaw Puller Saw His Own Team
    One day, while a get-together held by a certain unit of the People's Liberation Army and students in Beiping was in full swing, a welcoming PLA team entered from Qianmen. There were about twenty people, holding small flags and wearing black clothes. Judging from the flags, they were representatives of the Rickshaw Workers' Union. The soldiers felt extremely close to them, saying to each other, "Look, they're workers, our class brothers!"
    A worker leading the team straightened his ranks. He was extremely moved as he walked in front, took off his battered top hat, and bowed ninety degrees. He was so excited that he couldn't speak. He shouted with all his might, using all the strength he had in his life, "Comrades! Who used to think highly of us? We were the kind of people trampled underfoot, we were oppressed. The day before yesterday, I heard that the People's Liberation Army was about to enter the city, so I took a flag to welcome them, but I was arrested by the Kuomintang army. They locked me up for two days and said I would be shot. The flag originally said 'Welcome the People's Liberation Army,' but they changed it to 'Down with the People's Liberation Army.' I said to them, 'The People's Liberation Army belongs to the people, how can it be overthrown?' Today, I saw my own team, how happy I am! ......" As he spoke, his eyes gradually turned red, and he couldn't continue. He turned back to lead the workers in shouting slogans: "Long live Chairman Mao!" "Down with Chiang Kai-shek!" "Welcome the People's Liberation Army!" He shouted a sentence, looked back at his team, saw his own team, and then turned back to shout again, just like a child who had been bullied seeing his mother, wanting to pour out all the grievances in his heart.
    When the students enthusiastically shouted "Learn from the People's Liberation Army," he turned around and tightly held the hand of a PLA comrade, saying, "Comrade! You've come! You've come! ... Our own brothers!" As he spoke, he cried with emotion. A young worker next to him also cried loudly, and the eyes of the other workers also turned red. Some workers said, "Don't be sad! Our brothers are here, what is there to be sad about?" The leading worker said again, "Comrades! We are the working class, we will fight Chiang Kai-shek to the end even if we die!" As he spoke, he stomped his foot hard and wiped his eyes with his greasy sleeve, leading the workers to circle around the square, holding his battered top hat in his right hand, standing up straight and shouting: "Support Chairman Mao!" "Down with Chiang Kai-shek!" He repeated it eight times.　　　　　　　　　(Xinhua News Agency, Beiping)

　　三轮车夫看见了自己的队伍
    一天，当北平解放军某部和学生举行的联欢会开得正热闹的时候，从前门进来了一支欢迎解放军的队伍，二十几个人，手里拿着小旗、穿着黑衣服。从他们的旗子上看，知道他们是三轮车工人联合会的代表。战士们感到亲切极了，互相说：“你看，是工人，是我们的阶级弟兄！”
    一个领队的工人把自己的队伍整理好，很激动地走在前面，把头上的破礼帽往下一拿，行了一个九十度的鞠躬礼，他兴奋得说不出话来了。他发狂一样地用尽生平的力气大声地说：“同志们！过去谁看得起我们？我们这种人是给人踩在脚底下的，我们是受压迫的。前天，我听说解放军快进城了，我就打旗子去迎接解放军，被国民党的军队抓住了，把我关了两天，说非枪毙不可。我的旗子上本来写的是‘欢迎人民解放军’，他给我改成‘打倒人民解放军’。我对他们说：‘解放军是人民的，还能打倒吗？’今天，我看见了我们自己的队伍，我该是多么喜欢！………”说着说着他的眼圈渐渐地发红了，他说不下去了，回过头去领着工人们呼口号：“毛主席万岁！”“打倒蒋介石！”“欢迎解放军！”他喊一句，回头看看自己的队伍，看见了自己的队伍又回过头去再喊，就象受过人欺侮的孩子看见了母亲一样，想把满肚子的冤屈都倒出来。
    当学生们热烈的喊着“向人民解放军看齐”的时候，他回过头来紧紧地握着一位解放军同志的手，说：“同志！你们来了！你们来了！……我们自己的兄弟！”说着就感动地哭了，他旁边一个年青的工人也大声地哭了，其他工人的眼睛也发了红。有的工人说：“不要难过！咱们的兄弟们来了，还难过什么呢？”这个领头的工人又说：“同志们！咱们是工人阶级，死也要和蒋介石拼倒底！”说着他的脚狠狠地跺了一下，用他那油垢得发亮的袖子擦了一下眼睛，领着工人在广场上转了起来，右手抓住破礼帽，身子挺得直直的喊：“拥护毛主席！”“打倒蒋介石！”他一直重复地叫了八遍。　　　　　　　　　（新华社北平电）
