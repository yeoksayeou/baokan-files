　　Thoroughly Eliminate the Remaining Enemy in Xinxiang
  　Taihang Fifth Prefectural Committee Directs the Launch of a Political Offensive
    [Our Dispatch] The Taihang Fifth Prefectural Committee and the Military Subdistrict Political Department jointly issued instructions on launching a political offensive against the enemy. The instructions stated in brief: Our army has liberated Tianjin and Beijing, and the 316th Regiment of the 40th Division of the Jiang bandits in Xinxiang also surrendered to us a few days ago. All counties should immediately combine the Spring Festival cultural and entertainment movement with the launch of a political offensive, convene mass rallies and cadres' meetings to celebrate the liberation of Beijing and Tianjin, publicize Chairman Mao's eight-point peace proposal, expose the Jiang-American peace conspiracy, overcome the waiting mentality of some cadres who neglect the current struggle, seize the favorable situation to promote current work, shorten the war time, and strive to eliminate and annihilate the enemy and liberate the people of northern Henan at an early date. Therefore, (1) it is necessary to overcome the past practice of limiting ourselves to simple current affairs propaganda. In order to make the political offensive play a greater role, it must be combined with mobilizing the masses to oppose plunder, oppose maintenance, oppose the enemy's retaliation, suppress bandits, catch special agents, discuss war criminals, organize joint defense struggles, prevent bandits and defend themselves, protect production, and call on the masses to actively support the front in order to liberate northern Henan. Universally and deeply publicize the North China People's Government's proclamation on "Dissolving All Secret Society Organizations," correctly publicize our policy toward officers and soldiers of the Jiang bandit army, earnestly carry out enemy army work, and divide and disintegrate the Kuomintang reactionaries and bandits trapped in Anyang and Xinxiang. Point out their way out: Beijing and Tianjin are two different examples, and they can choose either road. (2) In order to unify the forces of political, military, and economic struggle against the enemy, it is necessary to strengthen unified leadership. The North and South Counties should organize anti-enemy struggle committees to unify the leadership of basic-level teams, militia, armed work teams, party, government, people's organizations, industry and commerce, and banks to achieve organic coordination and avoid and prevent various uncoordinated phenomena.

　　彻底消灭新乡残敌
  　太行五地委指示展开政治攻势
    【本报讯】太行五地委暨分区政治部联合发出对敌开展政治攻势的指示。略称：我军已解放平津，新乡蒋匪四十师三一六团也于日前向我投诚。各县应即结合春节文化娱乐运动开展政治攻势，召开群众大会干部大会庆祝平津解放，宣传毛主席八项和平条件的声明，揭发蒋美和平阴谋，克服某些干部忽视当前斗争的等待思想，抓紧有利形势推进当前工作，缩短战争时间，争取早日消灭歼敌解放豫北人民。因此（一）要克服已往仅限于单纯时事宣传的做法，为使政治攻势发挥其更大效力，必须结合发动群众反掠夺、反维持、反对敌人倒算、剿土匪、捉特务、讨论战争罪犯、组织联防斗争、防匪自卫、保卫生产、号召群众积极支前，为解放豫北而努力。普遍而深入的宣传华北人民政府“解散一切会道门组织”的布告，正确的宣传我对蒋匪军官兵的政策，认真开展敌军工作，分化、瓦解困守在安阳、新乡的国民党反动军队与土匪。指出其出路：北平、天津是两个不同的实例，道路任择一条。（二）为了统一政治、军事、经济上对敌斗争力量，必须加强一元化领导，南北两县组织对敌斗争委员会，统一领导基干团队、民兵、武工队、党、政、民、工商、银行各系统的力量求得有机配合，避免与防止各种不协调现象之发生。
