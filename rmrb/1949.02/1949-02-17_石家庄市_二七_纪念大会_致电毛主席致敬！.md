Shijiazhuang City "February 7th" Commemoration Meeting
　　Sends Telegram to Chairman Mao to Pay Respects!
　　The "February 7th" 26th Anniversary Commemoration Meeting of all staff and workers in Shijiazhuang City issued a telegram to the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China and Chairman Mao, which stated in brief:
　　Today, we are able to commemorate "February 7th" with a joyful and victorious mood, and we feel even more the flesh-and-blood connection between the Party and our working class, and Chairman Mao's correct leadership for us. Now, on this day when the whole country is about to win, all staff and workers in Shijiazhuang City resolutely support Chairman Mao's eight peace conditions and oppose the traitorous and reactionary government's hypocritical peace. We clearly recognize that only by carrying the revolution through to the end can the working class and the people of the whole country be completely liberated. Today, we respectfully salute the Party Central Committee and Chairman Mao, and under your leadership, we will fight for genuine peace and a new China of people's democracy.
　　The telegram addressed to Commander-in-Chief Zhu, transferred to all commanders and fighters of the People's Liberation Army, stated in brief:
　　Twenty-six years ago, the Chinese working class did not have its own armed forces. Today, we not only have powerful and elite armed forces, but also have achieved an unprecedented advantage in the balance of power, ensuring that the Chinese people will achieve victory throughout the country. This is the result of the wise leadership of the Commander-in-Chief and the heroic struggle of all commanders and fighters. In addition to paying revolutionary respect to the Commander-in-Chief and all commanders and fighters, we are willing to step up production to support the People's Liberation Army and strive for the liberation of the whole country!
　　The telegram addressed to the staff and workers of Beijing, Tianjin, Zhangjiakou, Fengtai, Changxindian, Tangshan and newly liberated cities stated in brief:
　　Although you have suffered oppression and pain under the rule of the enemy and puppets, the staff and workers have always adhered to the revolutionary tradition of the Chinese working class, and the struggle has never stopped. You risked the greatest danger to protect factories, railways, and mines from enemy destruction, and after liberation, you worked hard to restore production and support the front.
　　For your revolutionary spirit, all our staff and workers extend our brotherly condolences and regards, and hope that in the future we will work together for the final liberation of the country and the construction of a new China!
