　　We Are Coming Over
　　(Solicited Article)
　　Zhang Mangong
　　In the trenches under Taiyuan City, the People's Liberation Army soldiers were busy preparing to spend this memorable New Year well. Everyone cleaned the communication trenches and the cave dwellings. Colorful arches were erected at each communication trench entrance. New Year's special editions of door-panel newspapers, New Year pictures for the trenches, and New Year's cards from various companies were posted, creating a fresh and vibrant atmosphere. All of this seemed like a scene from peaceful times.
　　But at this time, we were launching an intense political offensive against Yan's bandit army. Just sixty meters ahead, under the quiet yellow earth mounds, were the enemy's communication trenches. Zhang Haiyu, the squad leader of the Sixth Squad of the Third Company, set up a sharply contrasting cartoon to match the enemy's desolate position. He stuck two steamed buns on a thin stick, with a green paper strip glued underneath, on which were written the words "Welcome Yan Army Soldiers to Come Over." He planted it on the front line and also hung a fancy small lantern next to it. After setting up all of this, he began to shout to the enemy:
　　"Fellow villagers, what do you see planted here?"
　　One of the enemy's sentries, a young boy, seemed to have noticed these things already. He immediately replied, "I see it, steamed buns."
　　"How many?"
　　"Two. What are those red and green things?"
　　"These are lanterns hung in our communication trenches for the New Year. Kid, come over and eat a bun."
　　"No."
　　Just then, Gong Wucheng, a messenger from the battalion headquarters, walked over. Hearing that the boy had a Yuci accent, he chimed in:
　　"Don't be afraid, kid! You come over, we'll eat the food you bring first, and you can eat later. You can't get enough to eat under Yan Xishan."
　　The boy stubbornly said, "You're lying, we eat rice and foreign flour."
　　Gong Wucheng laughed and said, "Kid, don't play dumb! Can rice and foreign flour grow on the streets of Taiyuan? You'll be eating cement in Wanbailin."
　　At this point, the boy recognized Gong Wucheng's familiar accent and asked him, "Where are you from?"
　　"I'm from Guocun, Yuci."
　　"How did you become a soldier?"
　　"I was drafted into the regular army by Yan Xishan."
　　"Which unit were you in?"
　　"The stretcher squad of the Second Regiment of the Personal Training Division. Let me tell you, I suffered in the Personal Training Division."
　　"Did your platoon leader hit you?"
　　"Yes, several times. I really couldn't stand the abuse and wanted to find the Eighth Route Army, but I didn't know where to find them. Kid, has your squad leader hit you?"
　　The two young men were now talking intimately. The boy chatted with Gong Wucheng as if he had met a friend. Hearing Gong Wucheng ask if he had been beaten, he said sadly, "I've been beaten several times. But how did you get over?"
　　"I was liberated in Jiexiu last year."
　　"Did you go home?"
　　"Yes."
　　"How long did you stay?"
　　"A week."
　　"Why did you come back?"
　　"I came to participate in the attack on Taiyuan." Seeing that the boy's thinking was following his lead, Gong Wucheng changed the subject and said, "Kid, listen to me, hundreds of thousands of American-equipped elite troops of the Kuomintang in Beiping and Tianjin couldn't stand up to the People's Liberation Army. What can these few soldiers of Yan Xishan in Taiyuan do? You can't get enough to eat and still have to risk your life. Our artillery for the city attack is already set up, just waiting for the commander's order to start the general offensive. Now is a good opportunity, come over quickly!"
　　The boy said anxiously, "Keep your voice down! I'm afraid of the landmines."
　　Gong Wucheng said with experience, "Those are tripwires, they won't explode unless you pull the wire."
　　Suddenly, the boy remembered something and said, "Do you have enough to eat there? Throw me a bun first, I haven't eaten enough." Saying that, he climbed onto the front line, "Don't shoot."
　　After Gong Wucheng threw him a bun, he quickly told him, "Hurry, their side is shooting over here, come over quickly."
　　Just then, an old soldier appeared from behind the boy. He seemed to have heard the conversation between the two young men and automatically helped the boy crawl out of a large gun hole.
　　Gong Wucheng thought the boy was coming over. "Come over quickly, our machine guns will cover you."
　　The boy looked around for a while, retreated like a rabbit, and said in a low and urgent voice, "Go back and tell those four people to come."
　　As soon as the boy's shadow disappeared, a face appeared from the gun hole—the old soldier.
　　"You can't shoot me."
　　"We won't."
　　The old soldier cut to the chase: "Tell me, where can I cross over from?"
　　"Run a few steps quickly, and you'll reach our side from our communication trench."
　　The old man didn't understand the path Gong Wucheng had indicated, and he used his shovel to enlarge the gun hole in just a few strokes. His heavy body slipped out from there. Gong Wucheng told him the route to take again.
　　"Don't go, wait a moment, I'll go back and call those three or four people, and bring our stuff and weapons." The old soldier excitedly and nervously hurried back into the hole.
　　As soon as it got dark, heavy, continuous footsteps came from the enemy's position. One person crossed the barbed wire first, aimed his machine gun at Taiyuan, and then eight people, divided into three groups, quickly ran towards our position, shouting repeatedly:
　　"Don't shoot! We are coming over."

　　我们过来了
    （应征文）
    张满弓
    在太原城下的战壕里，解放军的战士们在忙碌的准备着要好好的渡过这个有纪念意义的大年，大家清扫了交通壕和居住的窑洞，各交通壕口上，都搭起了五彩牌，门板报新年特刊、战壕年画、各连来的贺年片，红红绿绿贴的气象一新。这一切似乎都是太平年月的光景。
    但是这时我们正在向阎匪军展开了紧张的政治攻势，前边六十公尺远的静悄悄的黄土堆下边，便是敌人的交通壕。三连六班副张海玉，配合着敌人灰溜溜的阵地，布置了一幅尖锐对比的漫画。他用一根细棒子插上两个馍馍，下边黏了一张绿纸条，上写“欢迎阎军士兵过来”几个大字，插在阵地前沿上，旁边还挂上一个华丽的小灯笼，他把这一切景致布置好以后，就向敌人喊起话来：
    “老乡，你看这里插的什么东西？”
    敌人的哨兵中有一个小孩子，似乎早已注意到这些东西了，他马上回答说：“看见了，蒸馍。”
    “几个？”
    “两个。那些红红绿绿的是什么？”
    “这是过大年在我们交通壕挂的灯。小鬼，过来吃馍吧。”
    “不。”
    这时正好营部通讯员巩武成走过来，他听见小鬼是榆次口音，就接上说：
    “不怕，小鬼！你过来，送来饭我们先吃，你后吃。你在阎锡山那里是吃不饱的。”
    小鬼执拗的说：“你胡说，我们吃的是大米洋面。”
    巩武成笑着说：“小鬼，不要装糊涂了！太原的马路上还能长出大米洋面来？你到万柏林吃洋灰去吧。”
    这时小鬼听见了巩武成的口音很熟悉，就问他：“你是哪里人？”
    “我是榆次郭村的。”
    “你怎么当了兵的？”
    “被阎锡山编常备兵出来的。”
    “原来你在那一部分？”
    “亲训师二团担架排。我告你，我在亲训师可受了气了。”
    “你排长打过你？”
    “可打咧，打了好几次。实在不愿意受气，想找八路军，可是不知道到哪里找。小鬼，你班长打过你没有。”
    两个青年此刻已经谈得亲近起来了。小鬼竟象遇到朋友一样的和巩武成交谈起来。他听见巩武成问他挨过打没有，就难过的说：“挨过好几次。可是你怎么过去的。”
    “去年在介休被解放的。”
    “你回过家没有？”
    “回过。”
    “住了多长时间？”
    “一礼拜。”
    “怎么你又来了。”
    “我是来参加打太原来的。”巩武成看见小鬼的思想已经随着自己的要求想过来了，就转换了题目说：“小鬼，听我告诉你，北平、天津国民党几十万美械精锐军队，还顶不住解放军，太原这几个阎锡山的兵还行？你一天吃不饱还得卖命。我们攻城的大炮已经架好了，单等司令员的命令一下，就开始总攻，现在正是个好机会，你赶快过来吧！”
    小鬼焦虑的说：“你说话声音低些！我怕地雷。”
    巩武成很有经验的说：“那是拉雷，不拉绳子不会响的。”
    忽然小鬼又想起了一件事情说：“你们那是管饱吃的？先给我扔过一个馍馍来，我还没吃饱咧。”说着就爬上了前沿，“你们可不要打。”
    巩武成给他扔过去馍馍以后，连忙告他说：“快，招架我们侧面打过枪来，快过来吧。”
    这时从小孩子的后面出现了一个老汉兵，他似乎听见这两个青年的对话了，就自动的帮助小鬼从一个大枪眼里钻了出来。
    巩武成以为小鬼要过来了。“快过来，我们的机枪掩护你。”
    小鬼四下里探望了一会儿，兔子一般的退缩了回去，低声而急促的说：“回去叫我们那四个人去。”
    小鬼的影子刚刚不见，从大枪眼里又闪出一个人脸来——老汉兵。
    “你们可不敢打我。”
    “不打。”
    老汉兵开门见山的说：“你告我，从哪里能过去？”
    “你快跑上几步，从我们的交通壕跑到这边就到了。”
    老汉对于巩武成指示的道路弄不清楚，拿起铁锹把枪眼只几下就铲大了。笨重的身体从那里溜了出来。巩武成告他说了一遍要走的道路。
    “你不要走，等一会儿，我回去叫上那三四个人，连东西、武器都带上。”老汉兵兴奋而惊慌的赶快爬进洞里去。
    天刚黑下来。敌人的阵地上传来了沉重的连续脚步声，有一个人先过了铁丝网，把机枪向着太原架好以后，紧接着八个人，分为三个小组，迅速的向我们的阵地上跑来，连声的叫着：
    “不要打枪！我们过来了。”
