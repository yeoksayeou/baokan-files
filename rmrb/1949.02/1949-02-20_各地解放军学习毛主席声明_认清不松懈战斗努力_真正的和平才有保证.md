Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 18th. PLA units in various locations are enthusiastically studying Chairman Mao's statement of January 14th and unanimously believe that only by unremitting combat efforts, as called for by Chairman Mao, can true peace be guaranteed. The 20th Army Corps of the PLA in the Tianjin-Beijing area is actively studying amidst the joyful celebrations of the liberation of Tianjin and Beijing. They are using discussions, debates, recollections, and grievance-telling methods to deeply understand the significance of the Eight Peace Conditions. One soldier, recalling the deceptive peace tactics used by Chiang Kai-shek before launching the civil war in 1946, said, "This new peace conspiracy of the Kuomintang reactionaries is actually the same old trick." Soldiers of a certain unit said to Second Platoon Leader Zhao Shuyun, "I have been in the revolution for ten years! Back then, when fighting the Japanese devils and the Kuomintang army, we were hungry one moment and full the next, our clothes were patched upon patched, and that's how we fought our way to today's victory. Now the reactionaries want 'peace' again. If we are not careful and fall for their trap, ten years of my life will have been wasted on this revolution! My opinion is that we should resolutely implement Chairman Mao's Eight Conditions and carry the revolution through to the end." General Yang Cheng, commander of the Army Corps, called on all commanders and fighters to intensify their studies and military training, further standardize themselves, and respond to Chairman Mao's call with action at the celebration meeting of the Army Corps' directly subordinate units on the 6th, celebrating the liberation of Tianjin and Beijing.

The PLA on the Taiyuan front, along with over 20,000 people from various circles in Jinzhong, issued a telegram supporting Chairman Mao's statement and opposing the false peace of the Kuomintang traitor "government" at a celebration meeting for the liberation of Tianjin and Beijing held in Yuci City on the 6th. Deputy Commander Zhou Shidi pointed out at the meeting the various facts of Yan Xishan's futile resistance and affirmed, "We must and will soon liberate Taiyuan. Yan Xishan and his officers and soldiers must choose one of the two paths taken by Beiping and Tianjin. If the enemy does not accept Chairman Mao's Eight Conditions, they will only be destined to be annihilated."

When studying, a certain unit of the PLA on the Central Shaanxi front first held small-scale forums in each company for two to three days, and then convened a general meeting of soldiers of the entire company for free discussion. Many comrades were able to recognize the correctness of the Eight Conditions and the hypocrisy of the Kuomintang's peace overtures from history and their own personal experiences. Soldier Zhang Maoquan recounted his past experience in Suixie Zhuozishan, saying, "In January 1946, the day after the ceasefire order was issued, the Kuomintang sent two divisions to attack us." Soldier Zhang Fuyi of the Special Service Company also reviewed his own thinking in connection with this, saying, "In 1946, when we discussed peace in Zhuozishan, I thought there could be real peace, but it turned out to be false. Now, after two and a half years of bloody battle, the Kuomintang has been defeated, and they are using this gangster trick again. This time I truly recognize these bad guys."

All officers and soldiers of the former Kuomintang 110th Division, who revolted at Shuangduiji, also enthusiastically studied Chairman Mao's statement. Commander Liao Yunzhou, based on his past personal experience, thoroughly exposed the Kuomintang reactionaries' false peace. He said: On January 5, 1946 (a few days before the truce agreement), Chiang Kai-shek issued a secret attack order to all Kuomintang troops. At that time, each of the reorganized brigade commanders who were with me received a copy of the secret order.

After studying, the local armed forces of the Hebei-Shandong-Henan Military Region of North China had a clearer understanding of the current situation. They stated that the peace conspiracy of Chiang Kai-shek or other reactionary elements cannot deceive the eyes of the people of the whole country.

　　各地解放军学习毛主席声明
  　认清不松懈战斗努力
    真正的和平才有保证
    【新华社陕北十八日电】名地解放军正热烈地学习毛主席一月十四日的声明，并一致认为：只有如毛主席所号召的那样，不松懈战斗努力，真正的和平才有保证。平津地区解放军第二十兵团，在庆祝平津解放的欢乐声中，仍积极进行学习。他们用讨论、辩论、回忆、诉苦等方式，深入领会八项和平条件的意义。一位战士回想起一九四六年蒋贼在发动内战前也曾耍假和平的把戏时说：“国民党反动派这次和平新阴谋，其实就是过去的旧花样。”某部士兵对二排长赵书云说：“我革命十年啦！想当年打日本鬼子和国民党军队，饿一顿，饱一顿，衣裳补钉叠补钉，才打出今天的胜利来。反动派又要什么‘和平’，咱们一不小心，上了他妈的当，十年的命就白革了！我的意见是坚决实行毛主席的八条，把革命进行到底。”兵团司令员杨成将军，六日在兵团直属队庆祝平津解放大会上，号召全军指战员加紧习文练武，进一步正规化，用行动响应毛主席的号召。
    太原前线解放军连同晋中各界人士二万余人，六日在榆次城举行的庆祝平津解放的大会上，发出通电拥护毛主席声明，反对国民党卖国贼“政府”的假和平。副司令员周士第在大会上指出了阎匪仍在作无效的顽抗种种事实后，肯定地说：“我们一定要而且不久就要解放太原。阎匪及其所属官兵要在北平与天津的两条道路中选择一条。敌人如果不接受毛主席八项条件，就只有等着被歼灭的命运。”
    陕中前线解放军某部在学习时，各连先以两三天时间分别举小行型座谈，然后召集全连军人大会自由讨论。很多同志都能从历史上及自己切身的经历中认识八项条件的正确性和国民党求和的虚伪性。战士张茂全叙述他过去在绥协卓资山的时候，他说：“一九四六年一月间第一天下了停战令，第二天国民党就派两个师来进攻我们了。”特务连战士张福义并联系检讨自己的思想说：“一九四六年在卓资山讨论和平时，我以为真正能够和平，结果是假的。现在经过两年半的血战，国民党被打败了，他又来耍这一套流氓手段，这次我算真正认清楚这些坏家伙了。”
    在双堆集起义的前国民党一一零师全体官兵也热烈地学习了毛主席声明，廖运周师长又根据他过去的亲身经历，详尽揭露了国民党反动派要和平是假的。他说：一九四六年一月五日（即停战协定前几天）蒋介石就给所有国民党部队下秘密攻击令。那时和我在一起的整编旅长每人都发一份密令。
    华北冀鲁豫军区的地方武装经过学习以后，大家对时局有了更清楚的认识，他们表示：蒋介石或其他反动分子的和平阴谋，是迷惑不了全国人民的眼睛的。
