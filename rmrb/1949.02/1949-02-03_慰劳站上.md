　　At the Comfort Station
　　Zhang Zhimin

　　The night was dark, with no moon or stars. In Wangqingtuo Village, sixty miles from Tianjin, a dazzling bright light hung high on the street, marking: "This is the Comfort Station!" So that stretchers coming down from the front lines could quickly find it.

　　A warm reed mat shed had been set up here, with plenty of eggs, biscuits, milk, cigarettes, and hot soup prepared... In this comfort group were old women and men in their forties and fifties, as well as young boys and girls of fourteen or fifteen. They kept going to the entrance to look, afraid that the wounded comrades would freeze for even a minute longer outside or be unable to find the place.

　　The stretchers arrived, and they all shouted in unison: "Slow down! Slow down! Lay it flat, keep it steady!..." To ensure the stretchers were placed flat and to reduce the pain of the wounded comrades, the villagers were accustomed to shouting, "One, two! Down!"

　　At the comfort station, everyone grabbed various foods and crowded around, each hoping to have the wounded comrades eat something from their hands. One comrade was seriously wounded and was muttering loudly in delirium, "Charge! Charge! Fight! Fight quickly!" An old woman held a bowl of hot soup, lifted a corner of the blanket on the stretcher, and said, "Don't worry! Someone is fighting! They will take it down soon! Drink some hot soup to calm down!" She blew on each spoonful to cool it before putting it into the comrade's mouth, asking as she fed him, "Is it hot? Is it cold?" She touched the comrade's hand, stiff from excessive blood loss and freezing, and kissed the back of his hand for a long, long time, "Comrade, are you warm now?" The comrade looked at the old woman with gratitude and said forcefully, "Dear mother... I'm not cold!" Mothers of the People's Liberation Army! You have shown the greatest maternal love to your sons here!

　　The less seriously wounded comrades arrived sitting in carts. A thirteen-year-old boy peeled an egg and fed it to a comrade whose eyes were injured and whose face was still covered in blood, "Brother! Open your mouth! Eat an egg!" This was a soldier from a certain unit of the Northeast Liberation Army, only seventeen years old this year. Hearing it was a child's voice, he said gratefully, "Little brother! If only my eyes could see a little, I would never have come down, even if it meant death!"

　　As they were being sent to the hospital, an old villager driving the cart took off his cotton-padded coat and covered the wounded comrade with it. The soldier said:

　　"Old uncle, I'm not cold! It would be terrible if you got cold."

　　"You shed blood for us, what does it matter if I get a little cold!"

　　"You treat me so well, I feel so honored!"

### 慰劳站上

　　慰劳站上
    张志民
    夜，黑沉沉的，没有月亮，也没有星星，离天津六十里地的王庆坨村的街头上，高高的挂起一只耀眼的明灯，它标示着：“这里就是慰劳站！”使前线上下来的担架很快的就可以找到这里。
    这里搭起了暖和的席棚，准备了充足的鸡蛋、饼干、牛奶、纸烟、热汤……，在这慰劳团里有四五十岁的老大娘、老大伯，也有十四五岁的小弟弟小妹妹，他们一会会的到门口去瞧瞧，只怕负伤的同志在外面多冻一分钟或是找不到这个地方。
    担架过来了，他们都齐声的吆喝着：“慢点！慢点！放平，放稳！……”为使担架放的平稳，减少负伤同志的疼痛，老乡们都习惯的喊着“一二！放！”
    慰劳站上，每人都拿了各样吃的东西围上去，谁都希望把自己手里的东西叫负伤同志吃点。这是一个伤势很重的同志，他口里说着大声的呓语。“冲！冲！打呀！快打！”一位老大娘端了一碗热汤，掀开担架上的一个被角说：“别着急！有人打哩！快打下来呀！你先喝口热汤定定心！”她每一勺都用自己的嘴吹温才送进同志的嘴里，一边喂一边问道：“烫吗？冷不？”他摸着这同志因流血过多而冻得发僵的手，便用自己的嘴在他的手背上吻了许久、许久：“同志：暖过来了吧？”这个同志以感激的眼望望这位大娘，用力的说了一句：“亲娘………我不冷！”人民解放军的母亲啊！对你们的儿子在这里表现了最伟大的母爱！
    伤势较轻的同志是坐着大车来的，一个十三岁的小弟弟，把鸡蛋剥了皮，喂给一位眼睛负了伤脸上还沾着很多血的同志：“哥哥！张嘴！吃鸡蛋！”这是东北解放军×军的一个战士，今年才十七岁，他听到是个小孩子的声音，使感激的说：“小兄弟！我要是眼睛能看到一点，死也不下来呀！”
    当往医院送走的时候，一位赶车的老乡把自己的棉袍子脱下来，给负伤的同志盖在身上，这位战士说：
    “老大伯，我不冷！您冻着了可了不的。”
    “你为我们流血，我冷点算个啥！”
    “你们待我这样好，我觉得太光荣了！”
