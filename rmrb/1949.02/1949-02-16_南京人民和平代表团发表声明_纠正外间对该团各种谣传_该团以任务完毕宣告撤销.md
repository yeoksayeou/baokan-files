Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 14th: After the Nanjing People's Peace Delegation returned to Nanjing from Beiping on the 11th, various Chinese and foreign newspapers fabricated many rumors about the delegation's speeches and actions. To correct these rumors, the delegation issued a statement through the Central News Agency on the 13th, which is transcribed below: "Central News Agency, Nanjing, 13th: Representatives of the Nanjing People's Peace Delegation, noting that the reports in Chinese and foreign newspapers in recent days regarding the delegation's peace talks with the CCP authorities in Beiping are largely inconsistent with the facts, now issue the following statement: (1) The delegation did not participate in any gathering at the Presidential Palace on the 12th, nor is it prepared to meet with any government authorities. (2) There has been no indication that the CCP authorities are willing to compromise on the 'war criminals' and 'reorganization of the army' points in the eight conditions proposed. (3) There is no basis for the claim that the CCP authorities have provided specific conditions for the delegation to bring back. (4) The delegation's telephone contact in Qingdao was facilitated by female journalist Ren Zhujun, with Zhou Beifeng relaying the message from the other side. It was not a direct phone call between a certain representative and General Ye Jianying through personal connections that secured the delegation's visit. (5) At least six of the delegation's seven representatives never met with Generals Nie Rongzhen and Lin Biao. (6) The report by the Associated Press that the Communist Party will agree to hold peace talks with the Kuomintang within a month, and that Ye Jianying assured the delegation that the CCP would not attack the Yangtze River defense line before or during the peace talks, and that it recognizes President Li as not representing the Kuomintang in the peace talks, and does not demand the detention or trial of President Chiang, is not only pure fabrication but also extremely close to rumor-mongering. Furthermore, the China People's Peace Promotion Association, with the majority of its members and representatives either already in Shanghai or about to go to Shanghai, although having begun its work in Beijing, has decided at a regular meeting to move the association to Shanghai to continue promoting peace. All affairs at the office at No. 13, Liangyou Lane, Si Tiao Xiang, Xihuamen, Nanjing, are hereby terminated immediately. In addition, the association and the Professors' National Policy Research Association of various Chinese universities have announced the dissolution of the People's Peace Delegation formed by the two associations, as its mission is complete."

　　南京人民和平代表团发表声明
  　纠正外间对该团各种谣传       
    该团以任务完毕宣告撤销
    【新华社陕北十四日电】南京人民和平代表团十一日由北平返回南京后，中外各报对该团言论行动造了许多谣言。该团为了纠正这些谣言，十三日经过中央社发表声明，兹照录如下：“中央社南京十三日电：南京人民和平代表团代表，以连日中外各报所载该团在平与中共当局洽谈和平情形，多与事实不符，今发表声明称：（一）十二日本团参加总统府集会，绝无其事，亦不准备接见政府任何当局。（二）中共当局对于所提八项条件中之‘战犯’‘改编军队’二点可以让步，亦无所闻。（三）中共当局业有具体条件交由本团带回，尤无根据。（四）本团在青岛通话连络，系由女记者任竹君代接，而对方则系周北峰转达，非某代表以私人关系直接与叶剑英将军通话，方允本团前往。（五）本团七代表至少六人从未与聂荣臻、林彪两将军见面。（六）合众社所传，共党将在一月内同意与国民党人举行和谈，又称叶剑英向代表团提出保证，在和谈前与和谈期间不致攻击长江防线，与夫认李代总统在和谈中不是代表国民党及不要求拘留或审判蒋总统各节，不但纯属无稽，且属极近造谣。又，中国人民和平策进会，以大多数会员代表或早已去沪，或即将去沪，虽于在京展开工作，经常会议决，将该会移至上海，继续策进和平事宜。所有南京西华门四条巷良友里十三号事务所，即日宣告撤销。又该会与中国各大学教授国策研究会，顷以该二会含组之人民和平代表团任务完毕。宣告将该团撤销。”
