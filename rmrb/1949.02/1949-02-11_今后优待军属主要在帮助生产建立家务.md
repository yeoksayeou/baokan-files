　　Future preferential treatment for military families will mainly focus on helping with production and establishing households.

　　Editor:
    The government has explicit regulations regarding the care of families of revolutionary martyrs and military personnel, but specific and detailed measures have never been implemented. Now, as the Lunar New Year approaches, some families of revolutionary martyrs and military personnel are experiencing financial difficulties and are requesting assistance. However, according to the district government's instructions, no additional levies can be imposed with the public grain, nor can donations be held. Consequently, we are unable to meet their needs, leaving the village cadres extremely anxious! In the past, the government provided preferential treatment grain, but that is no longer available. We also used to hold donation drives in the village to help the families of revolutionary martyrs and military personnel, but the government no longer permits it. How can these difficulties be resolved?

　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　Xue Shiyong, Village Chief of Wangkuai Village, Second District, Fuping

Comrade Xue Shiyong:
    Due to the completion of land reform and the development of the situation, the focus of future preferential treatment work for military families will be on mobilizing and organizing military families to engage in mutual aid in production and helping them establish households. Therefore, in areas where land reform has been completed, the method of providing material subsidies will be cancelled. Your village military families' request for preferential treatment grain from the village government during this New Year period is mainly due to past practices, and also because the local government has not done enough in organizing military family production and providing publicity and explanation after the cancellation of subsidy grain. As for military families experiencing financial difficulties due to poor harvests or other reasons, the village government should promptly discuss ways of self-reliance through production to find a solution. Individuals with special difficulties can apply to the local county-level or higher government for individual assistance.

### 今后优待军属主要在帮助生产建立家务

　　今后优待军属主要在帮助生产建立家务编辑同志：
    照顾军工烈属，政府有明文规定，但具体详细办法，则从未办到。现值阴历年关，有些军工烈属，生活困难，要求照顾。但据区政府指示，不能随公粮带征，也不能举行募捐，因此无法应付，村干部焦灼万分！从前政府有优抗粮，现在已经没有了；从前对村中军工烈属，亦曾举行过募捐救济，现在政府已不许可。请问这些困难如何解决？
　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　阜平二区王快村长　薛世勇薛世勇同志：
    由于土改的完成和形势的发展，今后优待军属工作，重点在动员与组织军属生产互助，和帮助其建立家务。因此，土改完成地区，实物补助的办法取消。你村军属趁此年关，向村政府请求优军粮，这主要由于过去的惯例，也是当地政府在取消补助粮后，组织军属生产和宣传解释不够的结果。至于军属因歉收等原因生活困难，应由村政府迅速讨论生产自救的办法，求得解决。个别有特殊困难者，可向当地县以上政府请求，个别照顾一下。
