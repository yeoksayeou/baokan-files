(Taihang Electric) The Xingtai Municipal Government and the Workers' Union recently held a labor-management symposium to resolve incidents in which some capitalists in the city unreasonably infringed upon workers' legitimate rights. Capitalists in the city infringed upon workers' legitimate interests, including the illegal dismissal of workers by the Xicheng and Shanxingcheng private cigarette shops. Tong Lichang, a worker at Xicheng Cigarette Shop, was the leader of the union group and the head of the household registration group in the street. He was very active in union work. Jia Lin, the acting manager of the shop, was very dissatisfied with Tong and often beat and scolded him unreasonably, wanting to dismiss him. However, Tong performed very well in the factory and they could not find an excuse. So, they took advantage of the discord between worker Wang Yunian and Tong, provoked them, and amplified the dispute, using a "borrowed knife to kill" tactic to instigate Wang to beat Tong. On one occasion, Wang Yunian beat Tong until both his eyes were swollen. Last year, during the labor-management consultation to re-determine wages, Tong Lichang consciously implemented the government's policy of benefiting both labor and management, voluntarily reduced his wages, and signed a contract with the factory. However, Jia Lin did not act according to the contract and privately reduced the wages again. The owner and manager of Shanxingcheng Cigarette Shop all fled during the anti-traitor liquidation in 1946, and the business was managed by the street public office. Last year, after the return of subsidies for industry and commerce, Wu Xingcheng, one of the owners, took over. After Wu took over, he emphasized that the shop assistants during the trusteeship could not do business, so he dismissed all the managers and shop assistants during the trusteeship. But this was not the case. During the trusteeship period, the original capital of 14 million yuan increased to 50 million yuan. Although the government and the trade union mediated, four workers were still dismissed. When dismissing these four workers, the capitalists only paid twenty days' wages instead of the twenty-four days' wages that the workers should have received. These illegal acts were exposed by the workers one by one at the meeting. At first, some capitalists were unwilling to admit it, but the facts were all there and they could not argue strongly, and finally they all admitted it. Secretary Zhu of the municipal government immediately put forward a solution, saying: The destruction of contracts, beating and scolding of workers, and provocation of discord by the Xicheng and Shanxingcheng cigarette shops are all illegal acts and should be severely punished. However, because this is a first offense, the government takes an educational approach to promote correction, and therefore handles it leniently, giving Jia Lin a severe warning. The illegally reduced wages must be reissued in full as soon as possible. (It is not clear whether the workers dismissed by Shanxingcheng without reason and the underpaid wages were resolved at the same time? - Editor) Tong Lichang immediately expressed his attitude at the meeting, saying, "If Jia Lin can correct his mistakes and abide by the democratic government's policy of benefiting both labor and management, I will definitely work hard." Zhang Hua of the Xingtai Municipal Committee of the Communist Party of China said: Last year, in order to develop industry and commerce, the government took the initiative to propose amending certain excessively high wages. This was based on the interests of both labor and management, but some shops and factories reduced wages across the board, regardless of whether the actual wages were high or low. Some capitalists even took the opportunity to retaliate, dismissing workers without reason and infringing upon the legitimate interests of the workers. In the future, the policy of benefiting both labor and management must be implemented to ensure the protection of the legitimate interests of workers and shop assistants.

　　邢台私商贾林等侵犯工人福利
  　市政府予以严重警告
    【太行电】邢台市政府与职工会最近召开劳资座谈会，解决该市某些资方无理侵犯工人合法权利的事件。该市资方侵犯工人正当利益的行为，有西成、善兴诚两私营烟店非法解雇的行为。西成烟店工人童理昌是工会小组长和本街户籍组长，在工会工作中表现很积极，该店代理经理贾林对童十分不满，常常无理打骂童理昌，想将童解雇了，但童在厂内作工表现甚好，找不到借口，遂即利用工人王玉念与童不团结的空子，从中挑拨，扩大是非，用借刀杀人的办法策动王将童打走。有一次王玉念将童打得两眼青肿。去年在劳资协商重定工资时，童理昌曾自觉执行政府的劳资两利政策，自动将工资降低，并与厂方立过合同。但是贾林却不按合同办事，私自将工资再行降低。善兴诚烟店东家与经理，在一九四六年反奸清算中全部逃亡，该柜生意由街公所派人代管。去年退补工商业后，由东家之一的武兴诚接受。武接受后，强调代管时的店员不会做买卖，便将代管时期的经理店员全部解雇。但事实并非如此，在代管时期内，由原来资金的一千四百万元增至五千万元。虽经政府和职工会的调解，结果还是解雇了四个。在解雇这四个工人时，工人所应得的廿四天的工资，资方却只付了廿天的工资。这些非法行为都在大会上被工人一一揭露，开始有些资方还不愿承认，但事实俱在，无法强辩，最后便都承认了。当场市府朱秘书即提出解决办法说：西成、善兴诚两烟店破坏合同，打骂工人，挑拨是非，都是非法行为，本应受到严厉处分，但因初犯，政府本教育精神，以促其改正，特从宽处理，给予贾林以严重警告，非法减低的工资，要很快如数补发。资方应保证今后再不重犯（善兴诚无故解雇的工人及少发的工资不知是否同时解决？编者）童理昌当即在会上表示态度说：“如贾林能改正错误，遵守民主政府劳资两利政策，我一定还要好好干。”中共市委张华发言说：去年为了发展工商业，政府曾主动的提出修正某些过高的工资，这是从劳资双方利益出发的，但有些商店、工厂不管工资实际高低与否一律下降，甚至有些资方不明大义，便趁机报复，无故解雇工人，侵犯工人的合法利益。今后必须贯彻劳资两利的政策，确定保护工人、店员的合法利益。
