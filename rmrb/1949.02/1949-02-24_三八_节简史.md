A Brief History of "March 8th"

　　The March 8th International Working Women's Day originated forty years ago, on March 8, 1909, from the struggle of female workers in Chicago, USA. To fight for freedom and equality, the female workers of Chicago held a grand strike and demonstration, which received enthusiastic responses from the broad masses of working women in the United States. In 1910, the Second International Socialist Women's Conference was held in Copenhagen, the capital of Denmark. The German women's leader, also a world revolutionary women's leader, Clara Zetkin proposed at the conference that, in order to strengthen the unity and liberation of international working women, March 8th should be designated as International Working Women's Day. The conference unanimously adopted Zetkin's proposal and put forward proposals such as realizing "eight-hour work system," "equal pay for equal work," "protection of motherhood," and "protection of child labor." When the first "March 8th" was commemorated in 1911, working women in Germany, Austria, Sweden, Denmark, the United States, and other countries held demonstrations. Thus, the commemoration of "March 8th" became popular all over the world.
　　The "March 8th" commemoration in 1917 in Russia played an important role in the outbreak of the February Revolution on March 12th (February 27th in the Russian calendar) of that year. At that time, female workers in Petrograd, the Russian capital, under the leadership of the Russian Communist Party, held demonstrations against hunger, against the imperialist war, and against the Tsarist system. The workers of Petrograd held a city-wide general strike to provide assistance. In the struggle of workers seizing old Russian troops on the eve of the February Revolution, the female worker masses actively participated. When officers ordered the troops to fire on the workers, the female workers bravely rushed to the front, seized their guns, and then spoke to the soldiers, expressing their solidarity and calling on them to help the people overthrow the Tsarist system. This struggle of the female workers greatly promoted the participation of the Petrograd troops in the revolutionary uprising. Therefore, in 1923, the "March 8th" International Working Women's Day was designated by the Soviet Union as a national revolutionary anniversary.
　　Chinese women commemorated their own liberation festival for the first time twenty-five years ago, in 1924. Under the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party, the working women of Guangzhou united with oppressed women from all walks of life to hold a grand commemorative meeting in the First Park, putting forward slogans such as "Down with imperialism," "Down with warlords," "Equal pay for equal work," "Protect child laborers and pregnant women," "Equal education," "Prohibit child brides and wife system," "Prohibit keeping maids and concubines," "Establish child protection laws," and marched in formation. From 1925 onwards, the commemoration of "March 8th" gradually became popular in major cities. From then until now, the "March 8th" festival has been enthusiastically commemorated by the Chinese women masses every year.
　　"March 8th" Women's Day was born in the struggle of international working women for women's liberation and international solidarity. The history of "March 8th" illustrates the important role of working women in the revolutionary movement and the women's movement. Only by taking them as the foundation, taking them as the vanguard, and uniting with other working people and oppressed women from all walks of life, and fighting together, can women's liberation be realized.

　　“三八”节简史
    三月八日的国际劳动妇女节，起源于四十年前一九零九年三月八日，美国芝加哥女工的斗争。芝加哥的女工为争取自由平等，举行了盛大的罢工与游行示威，得到了美国广大劳动妇女热烈的响应。一九一零年国际第二次社会主义者妇女大会，在丹麦京城哥本哈根开会，德国的妇女领袖，也是世界革命妇女的领袖蔡特金在大会提议，为了加强国际劳动妇女的团结和解放，订三月八日为国际劳动妇女节。大会一致通过了蔡特金的提议，并提出实现“八小时工作制”“同工同酬”“保护母性”“保护童工”等提案。在一九一一年纪念第一个“三八”节的时候，德、奥、瑞典、丹麦、美国等国的劳动妇女都举行了示威游行。这样，“三八”节的纪念就在全世界流行了。
    一九一七年的“三八”节纪念，在俄国，对于当年三月十二日（俄历二月二十七日）二月革命的爆发发生了重要的作用。当时的俄国首都彼得格勒的女工，在俄国共产党的领导下，举行了反对饥饿，反对帝国主义战争，反对沙皇制度的示威。彼得格勒工人们举行了全城总罢工，以为援助。在二月革命前夜的工人们夺取旧俄军队的斗争中，女工群众积极参加。当士官命令军队向工人开枪时，女工们英勇地冲到前面，夺取了他们的枪支，紧接向士兵们说话，和他们表示联欢，号召他们来帮助人民推翻沙皇制度。女工们的这种斗争，大大地推动了彼得格勒军队参加革命起义。所以到一九二三年，“三八”国际劳动妇女节被苏联规定为全国的革命纪念日。
    中国妇女第一次纪念自己解放的节日，是在二十五年前的一九二四年。在中国共产党的领导下，广州的劳动妇女联合了各界被压迫妇女在第一公园举行盛大的纪念会，提出了“打倒帝国主义”、“打倒军阀”、“同工同酬”、“保护童工孕妇”、“同等教育”、“禁止童养媳妻制”、“禁止蓄婢纳妾”、“建立儿童保护法”等口号，并列队游行。从一九二五年起，“三八”节的纪念就逐渐普及于各大城市。从那时到现在，每年的“三八”节都被中国的妇女群众所热烈纪念。
    “三八”妇女节是国际劳动妇女争取妇女的解放和国际团结的奋斗中产生的。“三八”节的历史，说明了劳动妇女在革命运动中和妇女运动中的重大作用。只有以她们为基础，以她们为先锋，和其他劳动人民在一起，团结各阶层被压迫妇女，共同奋斗，才能实现妇女的解放。
