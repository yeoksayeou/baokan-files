　　Xinhua News Agency, Beiping, 10th -- The Beiping Military Control Commission of the People's Liberation Army has completely taken over the Beiping branch of the "Central Printing Plant" of the reactionary and traitorous Nationalist government. All the original personnel, from the factory director down, remained at their posts. The factory is large in scale and equipped with valuable universal engraving machines. Before the liberation of Beiping, war criminal Song Ziwen conspired to move this engraving machine to Jiangnan, but his conspiracy was thwarted due to the opposition of the majority of the workers. When the People's Liberation Army surrounded Beiping, the factory workers hid the engraving machine under a four-story building and spontaneously organized a security team to protect the factory from destruction by the Nationalist army. After the complete liberation of Beiping, the factory workers handed over all the factory's machinery and materials to the Military Control Commission intact and signed up to go to work. One hundred and twenty-three unemployed workers who had been dismissed under the Nationalist government also reported to the factory, requesting to be reinstated.
　　Xinhua News Agency, Beiping, 10th -- In order to avoid or reduce machine failures, the employees of the Shijingshan Power Plant have extensively reviewed the shortcomings in machine management during the Nationalist government era and actively proposed improvements. For example, in the past, there was a deep division between the power generation and machine repair departments, and their work was not connected, so that the power generation workers did not know how to pay attention to using the repaired machines, and the repair workers did not know where to start repairing the faults that had occurred. As a result, machine failures occurred frequently. Now, after discussion among the employees, it has been determined that the power generation workers should indicate the part, cause, and time of the failure in detail when filling out the repair ticket, and attach a diagram. When repairing a machine, the repair workers should ask the power generation workers responsible for the machine to inspect it in detail. At present, the enthusiasm of the factory workers is extremely high. Before the Spring Festival, the electrical workers cleaned the various suction fans of the high and low pressure furnaces, inspected the carbon brushes of generators three, four, and five, and prepared sufficient backup parts and accessories. The above work, which would normally take twenty days to complete under the Nationalist government, was now completed in only five days. Before the liberation of Beiping, the plant once experienced difficulties in burning coal. At that time, all the factory workers dug out 3,000 tons of bituminous coal that had been buried under accumulated soil for many years in the factory to meet the urgent need. Now that the Beining Railway and the Beiping-Mentougou branch line are open, the plant's fuel supply is steadily being supplied.

　　北平军事管制委员会接收“中央印制厂”分厂
    【新华社北平十日电】人民解放军北平军事管制委员会已将国民党反动卖国政府的“中央印制厂”北平分厂完整地接收。原有人员自厂长以下无一离厂。该厂规模宏大，备有名贵的万能制版机。在平市解放前，战犯宋子文曾阴谋将此项制版机迁至江南，由于广大职工反对，宋逆阴谋未遂。人民解放军包围平市时，该厂职工即将此项制版机掩藏于四层大楼下，并自动组织纠察队保护工厂，以防国民党军破坏。北平完全解放后，该厂职工即将全厂机器和资材完整地向军管会交出，并报名上班工作。国民党统治时被迁职的一百二十三个失业工人亦到厂报到，要求恢复工作。
    【新华社北平十日电】石景山发电厂职工为避免或减少机器发生故障，曾广泛检讨该厂在国民党统治时期存在于机器管理方面的缺点，并积极提出改进办法。如过去该厂操作发电部分与机器修理部分之间，隔阂甚深，工作互不联系，以致发电工人不知道怎样注意使用修理后的机器，而修理工人也不知道从什么地方着手修理已经发生的故障。因而机器故障经常发生。现在经过职工们讨论，确定操作发电的工人在填写修理票时应把发生故障的部分、原因、时间详细注明，并附上图样。修理工人在修好一件机器时，应请负责看管机器的发电工人详细验收。现该厂职工工作热情极高。电气工人在春节前清理了高低压炉的各式吸风机，检查了三四五号发电机的炭精，并准备了足用的后备品与配件。上述工作按国民党统治时一般工作效率需时二十天，现在只五天便作完了。北平解放前，该厂烧煤一度发生困难，当时全厂职工曾在厂内挖出多年来被积土埋掉的烟煤三千吨，以应急需。现在北宁路及北平至门头沟支线均告畅通，该厂燃料已获源源供应。
