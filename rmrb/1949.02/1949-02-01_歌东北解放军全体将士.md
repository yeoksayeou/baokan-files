Heroes from the Black Mountains and White Waters,
　　You have achieved great success in liberating the Northeast.
　　Traveling thousands of miles with diligence and hardship,
　　Climbing mountains and wading rivers into the Great Wall.
　　The advancing army is mighty and joyful,
　　Your awe-inspiring power shakes Tianjin and Pingjin.
　　Frightening the bandit chieftain Chiang Kai-shek,
　　The Nanjing clowns are trembling with fear.
　　Liberating famous cities of culture,
　　Brothers-in-arms join forces, increasing our strength.
　　I am practicing my skills in school,
　　Learning the skills of the soldiers.
　　Soon I will finish my studies,
　　And march south shoulder to shoulder with you.
　　Surging like the water of the ocean,
　　We will submerge the Chiang family's small court.
　　All the elders and folks across the country will be liberated,
　　Our suffering brothers will be freed from their cages.
　　We will enjoy freedom and happiness for millions of generations,
　　The Chinese people will be forever glorious.
　　　　　　Wang Fengling and Zheng Shuqi, Students of the North China Military and Political University

　　歌东北解放军全体将士
    黑山白水众英雄　解放东北成大功
     辛勤艰苦行千里　登山涉水入长城
     进军浩荡人欢乐　威风凛凛震津平
     吓坏匪首蒋介石　南京群丑心胆惊
     解放名市文化城　兄弟会师力量增
     我在校中练本领　学习将士诸技能
     不久即将学完毕　并肩携手向南征
     汹涌好似海洋水　淹没蒋家小朝庭
     全国父老得解放　苦难兄弟出牢笼
     自由幸福亿万代　中华人民永光荣
  　　　　华北军政大学学员王凤龄、郑书奇
