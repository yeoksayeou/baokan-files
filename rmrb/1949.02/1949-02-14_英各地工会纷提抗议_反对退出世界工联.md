Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, February 12th: TASS, London: The Birmingham Trades Council, representing 150,000 members, has condemned the General Council of the British Trades Union Congress (TUC) for withdrawing from the World Federation of Trade Unions.  Rowe, the Birmingham District Organizer of the Foundry Workers Union, strongly criticized the actions of the TUC representatives, saying: "We believe this divisive action is an insult to the Chinese workers." The Trades Councils of Tooting (in London), the branches of the National Union of General and Municipal Workers in Dartford (in Kent, southeast of London), Hendon (in Middlesex, northwest of London), and the branches of the Amalgamated Engineering Union and the Amalgamated Society of Woodworkers in Wapping (in London) have also recently raised protests.
