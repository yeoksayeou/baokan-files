　　【Taihang News】Wuxiang convened an enlarged county-level cadre meeting on the fourth of last month and specifically inspected the propaganda and education work in concluding land reform and Party rectification. In addition to affirming the achievements of propaganda and education work, it also inspected many shortcomings in the propaganda and education work, which led to ideological misinterpretations and adverse effects among the masses.
    First, some villages mechanically misused the "accounting" method regardless of the content of propaganda and education. For example, some villages randomly calculated the number of activists, middle-of-the-roaders, and backward elements among the masses, creating new rifts among the masses. Some villages, when conducting education on production prospects, attempted to achieve the goal of the masses consciously organizing themselves by calculating accounts of future poverty. For example, some villages calculated that more than 50% would be poor in the future, and the leading comrades organized these households. Other villages, after calculating accounts, found that most of the military families would be poor, so some military families began to cry. Still other villages insisted that the masses recognize that the reason for past poverty was due to each person looking after themselves, and they also erased the exploitation of feudal landlords. In addition, some villages did not start from the masses' realistic thinking and inappropriately promoted "socialist society," causing some masses to sell their cattle. After inspection and discussion, attention has been paid to and correction has begun. (Wuxiang County Party Committee Office)

　　武乡检查宣教工作偏向 　 乱用“算帐”组织互助
    引起群众思想混乱
    【太行讯】武乡于上月四日召开全县扩大干部会议时，特将结束土地改革与整党中的宣传教育工作进行了检查。除肯定宣传教育工作的成绩外，同时也检查了在宣传教育工作上存在的许多缺点，以致引起群众思想上的错觉与不良影响。
    首先是有些村不论在进行什么宣传教育内容时均机械的乱用“算帐”的方法，如有的村在群众中乱算积极分子、中间分子、落后分子等数目，以致在群众中造下一些新的隔阂。有的村在进行生产前途教育时，企图以算将来还要穷的帐，来达到群众自觉组织起来的目的。如有的村算百分之五十以上将来是要穷的，领导同志就把这些户组织一下。还有的村算帐结果，算的军属大部要穷，因此有的军属竟哭起来。还有的村硬要群众认识过去所以穷是由于各顾各，把封建地主的剥削也抹煞了。另外还有的村子不从群众的现实思想出发，不适当的宣传“社会主义社会”，以致有的群众把牛卖了。以上经过检查讨论后，已开始注意与纠正。（武乡县委办公室）
