　　Driven by Rising Prices
  　Italian Strike Movement Resurges
    [Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 12th] Compelled by continuously rising prices, Italian workers are launching strikes in various places one after another, demanding wage increases. According to a TASS Rome dispatch, 65,000 workers at the "Fiat" factory in Turin, the central city of northwestern Italy, went on strike again on the 7th, demanding wage increases. Workers at the port of Livorno (along the west coast of central Italy) held a two-hour strike on the 2nd. National bank employees in Italy also held a 24-hour general strike on the 2nd, bringing all silver mine operations to a standstill. In addition, the general strike of Sardinian workers, which began in the province of Cagliari at the southern tip of Sardinia earlier this month, ended victoriously on the 6th. Workers' wages increased by 17 percent. The Sardinian strike forced industry and commerce, seaports, automobile transportation, and electricity supply to a standstill, and railway transportation was partially interrupted.
    Further dispatch: The Italian Factory Owners Association recently sent a letter of ultimatum to the General Confederation of Labor, unilaterally announcing the abolition of the agreement concluded with the General Confederation of Labor in August 1947 to protect workers' rights regarding the powers of factory committees, and announced the restoration of the agreement on factory committee activities signed in September 1943. The secretary of the Italian General Confederation of Labor replied to the Factory Owners Association on the 7th, declaring that it could not accept this unilateral decision. The General Confederation of Labor also instructed all its organizations to continue to act in accordance with the 1947 agreement. To protest this unreasonable measure by the Factory Owners Association, the Turin General Confederation of Labor decided to call on Turin workers to hold a half-hour protest strike.

　　迫于物价高涨
  　意罢工运动再起
    【新华社陕北十二日电】为物价不断高涨所迫，意大利工人正在各地陆续掀起要求增加工资的罢工运动。据塔斯社罗马消息，意大利西北部中心城市都灵的“菲亚特”工厂的六万五千工人，七日再度举行罢工，要求增加工资。里窝那海港（沿意中部西面海岸）的工人，曾于二日举行两小时罢工。意全国银行职员，亦曾于二日举行二十四小时总罢工，使银矿业务全部停顿。此外，本月初由撒丁岛南端卡利阿省开始之撒丁岛工人总罢工，已于六日胜利结束。工人工资增加百分之十七。撒丁岛的罢工曾迫使工商业、海港、汽车运输及电力供应陷于停顿，铁路运输部分中断。
    另讯：意大利厂主联合会，最近以最后通牒形式致函总工会，片面宣布废除保护工人权利的一九四七年八月与总工会缔结之保护工厂委员会职权的协定，并宣布恢复一九四三年九月签订的关于工厂委员会活动的协定。意大利总工会书记已于七日复函厂主联合会，宣布不能接受这一片面的决定。总工会并训令其一切组织继续遵照一九四七年的协定行事。都灵总工会为抗议厂主联合会这一无理措施，决定号召都灵工人举行半小时抗议性罢工。
