　　Cadres and Villagers Celebrate Victory with Torch Parade
　　On February 1st, when the news of the complete liberation of Beiping arrived, every cadre of a certain organization in North China and the villagers where they were stationed jumped for joy, celebrating the victory with firecrackers. The torches made of straw, prepared for the nighttime torch parade, were raised high towards the sky, and joyous and excited slogans echoed through the mountains. The sound of gongs rang out, and the Yangko dance troupe started twirling. The sky gradually darkened, but people danced so happily that no one wanted to stop. The cultural and entertainment propaganda teams from neighboring villages also came to join the gathering, beating drums and gongs. Torches and colorful lanterns were lit in the square.
　　The parade passed through three villages. The dark fields were filled with torchlight, and everywhere there was the sound of gongs, songs, and laughter, until late at night when everyone returned to the village. (Wei @)

　　机关干部与驻村群众
  　火炬游行祝捷
    二月一号，北平宣告完全解放的消息传来，华北某机关与驻村的群众，每个人都被胜利鼓舞得跳跃起来，庆祝大会在鞭炮声里开始，准备黑夜火炬游行的谷草火把，一个个向天空高举，愉快兴奋的口号声震响着山野，锣声响起，秧歌队又扭开了。天色渐黑，但人们是这样欢乐地扭着，没有人愿意停止。邻村老乡们的文化娱乐宣传队也敲着锣鼓赶来参加会，广场上点起火把和各种彩色的灯来。
    游行的队伍穿过三个村子，黑色的田野上到处是火光，到处都是锣鼓声、歌声、笑声，直到夜深始返回驻村。　　　　（韦＠）
