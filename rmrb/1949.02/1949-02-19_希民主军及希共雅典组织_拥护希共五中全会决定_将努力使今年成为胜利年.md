Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, February 17th: The Greek Democratic Army units and the Athens organization of the Greek Communist Party have issued statements endorsing the decisions made at the Fifth Plenary Session of the Greek Communist Party at the end of last month. According to a report from the Telegraphic Agency of the Soviet Union (TASS) in Prague on the 13th, various units of the Greek Democratic Army have held large-scale meetings to thoroughly discuss the decisions of the Fifth Plenary Session of the Greek Communist Party. In telegrams to the Central Committee of the Greek Communist Party and the General Secretary of the Greek Communist Party, Zachariadis, the soldiers and cadres of the Democratic Army pledged that they would do their utmost to implement the decisions of the Central Committee of the Greek Communist Party and make 1949 a year of victory. The congresses of various units also pledged to make every effort to eliminate any opportunistic tendencies that deviate from the Party's policies and wholeheartedly realize the Party's strategic goals.

The Athens organization of the Greek Communist Party also issued a statement endorsing the decisions of the Fifth Plenary Session of the Greek Communist Party, calling on the workers and people of Athens to fight for the realization of these decisions. The statement declared: "The Athens organization of the Greek Communist Party condemns any opportunistic tendencies within the Party and agrees with the Central Committee's criticism of right-leaning and opportunistic tendencies within the Party." The significance of this statement from the Athens organization lies in the fact that it proves that, although the royalist fascists boast that any Communist Party organization within the city of Athens has been destroyed, in fact, the Communist Party's organization still exists in Athens and is carrying out a resolute struggle. The statement also proves that the Athens organization of the Greek Communist Party, working under conditions of extreme terror and persecution by the enemy, has not lost its long-term political direction and is able to recognize the errors of its leadership. Note: The Fifth Plenary Session of the Greek Communist Party criticized the work of the Athens branch of the Political Bureau of the Greek Communist Party, and the Committee of the Athens organization of the Greek Communist Party was dissolved several months ago. The members of the dissolved committee have been ordered to go to the Democratic Army, and a new committee has been appointed.

　　希民主军及希共雅典组织
  　拥护希共五中全会决定
    将努力使今年成为胜利年
    【新华社陕北十七日电】希腊民主军各单位及希共雅典组织发表声明，拥护上月底希共五中全会的各项决定。据电通社布拉格十三日讯：希腊民主军各单位均已举行大会，彻底讨论了希共五中全会的决定。民主军的士兵与干部在大会通电中向希共中央委员会及希共总书记萨查利阿第斯保证：他们将尽全力实现希共中央的决定，使一九四九年成为胜利年。各单位的大会并保证尽一切努力，以铲除脱离党的政策的任何机会主义偏向，全心全意地实现党的战略目的。
    希腊共产党雅典组织亦发表声明，拥护希共五中全会的决定；号召雅典工人与人民为实现这些决定而斗争。该声明声称：“希共雅典组织谴责党内任何机会主义的倾向，同意中央对党内右倾与机会主义偏向的批评。”雅典组织这一声明的意义，在于它证明了：虽然保皇法西斯吹嘘说雅典市内的任何共产党组织均已被摧毁，而事实上，共产党的组织仍在雅典存在着，并进行坚决的斗争。该声明也证明了：在极端恐怖与受敌人迫害的条件下工作的希共雅典组织，并没有迷失远大的政治方向，并能够认识其领导机构的错误。按：希共五中全会曾批评了希共政治局雅典分局的工作，希共雅典组织的委员会已在数月前被解散。被解散的委员会的委员已奉命前往民主军，新的委员会已经指定。
