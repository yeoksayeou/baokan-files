Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, February 12th: In the face of the rising democratic forces of people around the world, how does American imperialism provide military "aid" to reactionaries in various countries to achieve its goal of militarily controlling these countries? An article written by Huy and recently published in an American business magazine provides some facts and figures on this. The author of the article pointed out that the United States is currently "aiding" the armies of thirty countries in various ways and is considering rearming Germany and Japan. This plan will cost at least $1 billion in the 1948 fiscal year (ending this June) and a total of $5 billion.

The author pointed out that in South Korea, two American infantry divisions are currently training and equipping local "police and coast guard forces." The US occupation forces in Japan cost American taxpayers an additional $1 billion per year. "Some army staff members are suggesting using Japanese divisions to save the situation in the East." The author predicts that "a new Japanese army under American rule may appear by the end of this year." The author continued: US military missions are currently training and building the Philippine army to fight guerrillas. The United States is currently spending huge sums of money on the Greek royalist fascist army, which has received 408,763 tons of military supplies and materials, worth $182,147,000, and is commanded by 366 American army and navy officers. The cost to the United States for this army in the future will be no less than $100 million per year. It is expected that US military "aid" to Turkey will continue to reach $50 million per year. In addition to maintaining a military mission of 45 American officers and soldiers in the Iranian army and a mission of 15 American officers and soldiers in the Iranian gendarmerie, the United States also provides a large amount of military "aid" to Iran each year. The author stated that the biggest problem the United States faces in "aiding" foreign armies is the expansion of the French army, that is, training and equipping at least 33 divisions as soon as possible. Because some in the US ruling class advocate arming Germany instead of France, the American military is considering restoring the German army. Murphy, the political adviser to Clay, the commander of the US occupation forces in Germany, holds this view. The author believes that the United States will adopt a compromise approach: slightly expand the French army, and restore the German army under US and British control. The author pointed out: "If the Potsdam Agreement is abolished," then this is very likely to be realized. In Latin America, the United States is "aiding" the armies of 14 countries, including "reorganizing them according to American policies." According to the author, US military missions are currently working in Brazil and Mexico, and a total of 400 American officers and soldiers are serving in Latin American countries. However, this extremely vicious practice of American imperialism cannot stop the tide of the world people's movement, nor can it allow its aggressive policies to continue without suffering failure.

　　美帝对外军事“援助”真相
    【新华社陕北十二日电】在世界各国人民民主力量高涨前面，美国帝国主义如何对各国反动派施行军事“援助”，以达到其在军事上控制这些国家的目的呢？美国商业杂志最近发表的一篇胡伊写的论文，对此提供了某些事实与数字。该文作者指出：美国目前正用各种方式“援助”三十个国家的军队，并正在考虑重新武装德国与日本。这一计划在一九四八年财政年度（按至今年六月底为止），至少将耗费十亿美元，总共将耗费五十亿美元。
    作者指出：在南朝鲜，两个美国步兵师目前正在训练与装备当地“警察与海防部队”。美驻日占领军使美国纳税人每年多负担十亿美元。“某些陆军参谋人员正建议利用日本师团来挽救东方局势。”作者预料“美国统治下的新的日军可能于今年底出现。”作者继称：美国军事使团目前正在训练和建立菲律宾军队，对游击队作战。美国目前正以巨量金钱用在希腊保皇法西斯军身上，该军队已获得四十万八千七百六十三吨军火和物资，其价值为一亿八千二百一十四万七千美元，该军队并受三百六十六名美国陆海军军官的指挥。该军队在今后对美国之耗费每年将不下于一亿美元之谱。据预料，美国对土耳其的军事“援助”每年亦将继续达五千万美元之数。除了维持在伊朗军队中由美官兵四十五人所组成的军事使团，及在伊朗宪兵中由美国官兵十五人所组成之使团外，美国每年给予伊朗之军事“援助”，数目亦甚巨大。作者称：在“援助”外国军队中，美国面临的最大问题是扩大法国军队问题，即至少要尽快地训练与装备三十三个师以上。由于美统治阶级中有人主张武装德国而不武装法国，美国军界方面正考虑恢复德军。德境美占领军司令克莱的政治顾问墨非即持此主张。作者认为美国将采取折衷的办法：即稍稍扩大法军，而在美英管制之下，恢复德国军队。作者指出：“如果波茨坦协定被废除了”，那么这点就极有可能实现。在拉丁美洲，美国正“援助”十四个国家的军队，其中包括“根据美国方针”来改编它们。据作者称：美国军事使团目前正在巴西、墨西哥工作，而在拉丁美洲各国服务的美国官兵总共达四百人。然而，美国帝国主义这种穷凶极恶的作法，既不能阻止世界人民运动的浪潮，也不能使其侵略政策继续不遭受失败。
