Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 9th. A faction of Kuomintang reactionaries has established a so-called "government" in Guangzhou, announced by the puppet Executive Yuan on the 7th of this month. The puppet Executive Yuan claims to have "moved the government to Guangzhou," but another faction of reactionaries remaining in Nanjing demands its return to Nanjing. Sun Ke, the puppet Executive Yuan head and major war criminal, gave speeches in Guangzhou on the 6th and 7th, rehashing the old tune of "unconditional ceasefire first," which had already been retracted by puppet Acting President Li Zongren on the 22nd of last month. Sun Ke openly rebelled against Li Zongren's statement about being willing to negotiate based on the eight peace terms proposed by the Chinese Communist Party, saying "the current government has moved to Guangzhou to conduct affairs, and we must re-examine the past," and "the CCP's proposal to punish war criminals is absolutely unacceptable." Sun Ke deliberately made a fuss, saying, "The fact that our government is the only government recognized by all countries in the world as the representative of the Republic of China is completely denied by the Communist Party." However, Sun Ke's own words and actions precisely prove that his so-called "government" no longer exists. Can the relocation of a government be announced by one of its local organs instead of its "head of state"? Can an "Executive Yuan" overturn the decisions of its "head of state"? Sun Ke's "Executive Yuan" had already overturned the statement of its "President" Chiang Kai-shek on the 19th of last month, and has not yet responded to the CCP spokesman's inquiry. Now, it not only repeats the overturning of Chiang Kai-shek's statement but also adds the overturning of its "Acting President" Li Zongren's statement. From this, it can be seen that the Kuomintang's so-called "government" has fundamentally collapsed organizationally. From this, it can be seen that saying this so-called "government" is a rabble is no longer factual; now there is no "rabble," but only chickens flying and dogs running, scattering into small groups of fugitives who are not responsible for each other.

Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 9th. The fact that a group of war criminals headed by Sun Ke and Wu Tiecheng, who fled to Guangzhou, are resuming calls for war accurately points out the true face of bandit chieftain Chiang Kai-shek's "retirement." The two bandits, Sun Ke and Wu Tiecheng, decided to leave Nanjing only after personally consulting Chiang Kai-shek in Fenghua at the end of last month. In Fenghua, bandit Chiang is still busily sending out hundreds of telegrams every day, directing the group of reactionaries within the Kuomintang who are attempting to continue armed resistance against the People's Liberation Army. Li Zongren, the puppet acting president, guarding the empty city of Nanjing, although verbally claiming to be willing to accept the eight peace terms of the Chinese Communist Party as the basis for negotiations, and claiming that this posture is not a disguise, is in fact continuing to act as a guard for the Yangtze River for American imperialists and Chiang Kai-shek to facilitate their preparations for war behind the scenes. Li Zongren's role in covering up the war can be proven by the remarks made by his personal representative Gan Jiehou in Shanghai on the 5th of this month. Gan Jiehou firmly stated that Li Zongren and Sun Ke's opinions were completely in agreement and claimed that "there are sufficient reasons for the Executive Yuan to move to Guangzhou." Gan Jiehou opposed the peaceful resolution in Beiping (which is the only truly peaceful resolution to date) and declared that "the government will not consider any suggestions for partial peace." Despite the conflict in power and methods between Li Zongren and Chiang Kai-shek, how can their double act be so in sync? This is because both are subservient to their common master, American imperialism. Although some important American military personnel believe that Li Zongren's mission is nearing completion and are planning to reinstate Chiang Kai-shek, Li Zongren still hopes to gain more favor from the United States in his continued activities in order to directly obtain American aid.

　　国民党“政府”根本崩溃
  　战犯孙科又成立一个伪政府         
    在广州从新号召战争，完全暴露了蒋匪介石“引退”真面目。
    【新华社陕北九日电】国民党的一部分反动派又在广州成立了一个所谓“政府”，这是由伪行政院在本月七日宣布的。伪行政院自称已经“迁政府于广州”，但是留在南京的另一部分反动派则要求其回到南京。伪行政院长重要战争罪犯孙科于六七两日在广州发表谈话，重弹其已在上月二十二日被伪代总统李宗仁所收回的“先行无条件停战”的老调。孙科公然反叛李宗仁关于愿在中共所提八项和平条件下进行谈判的声明，说是“现政府已迁穗办公，吾人应对过去重新加以检讨”，又说是“共党所提出之惩治战犯一节，即系绝对不能接受者”。孙科故意大惊小怪地说：“我国政府为全世界各国所承认之唯一代表中华民国之政府之事实，共党竟全然予以否认。”但是孙科自己的言论行动，恰恰证明他的所谓“政府”已经不存在了。难道一个政府的迁移能够不由它的“元首”来宣布，而由它的一个局部机关来宣布吗？难道一个“行政院”能够推翻它的“元首”的决定吗？孙科的什么“行政院”，在上月十九日已经推翻过它的“总统”蒋介石的声明，虽经中共发言人予以质问，迄今尚未作只字之答复。现在它不但重复推翻蒋介石的声明，而且又加上一条推翻它的“代总统”李宗仁的声明了。由此可见，国民党的所谓“政府”，已经从组织上根本崩溃。由此可见，说这个什么“政府”是一群乌合之众已经不合于事实了；现在并没有什么“乌合”，而只有鸡飞狗走，走成几小群互相不负责任的亡命之徒了。
    【新华社陕北九日电】以孙科、吴铁城为首逃往广州的一群战争罪犯已经在从新号召战争，这个事实，准确地指明了匪首蒋介石“引退”的真面目。孙科与吴铁城两匪是在上月底亲往奉化向蒋介石请示以后才决定离开南京的。蒋匪在奉化依然每天发出几百份电报，忙碌地指挥着国民党内妄图继续武力抵抗人民解放军的一群反动分子。守着南京空城的伪代总统李宗仁，虽然在口头上宣称愿意接受中国共产党的八项和平条件以为谈判基础，并且宣称这种姿态并不是伪装，实则继续替美国帝国主义者和蒋介石担任着看守长江，以便于他们在后台准备作战。李宗仁的这种掩护战争的作用，从他的私人代表甘介侯本月五日在上海的谈话中可以得到证明。甘介侯坚称李宗仁与孙科的意见完全相合，并称“政院迁穗实有充足理由”。甘介侯反对北平的和平解决（这是至今唯一真实的和平解决），声明“政府对任何局部和平之建议决不加以考虑”。李宗仁和蒋介石尽管存在着权力和方法的冲突，但是他们的双簧何以能够如此合拍呢？这是因为两人都听命于共同的主人美国帝国主义的原故。虽然若干美国重要军人认为李宗仁的任务已经接近于完成，而在计划令蒋介石复职，但是李宗仁仍希望在他的继续活动中可以得到美国更多的宠幸，以便直接取得美国的援助。
