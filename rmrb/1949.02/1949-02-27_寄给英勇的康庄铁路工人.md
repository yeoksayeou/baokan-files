To the Brave Kangzhuang Railway Workers Guo Yingfang, Wei Xiaojiang, and Liu Yongquan:

　　On the fourth of this month, after reading in the People's Daily about you three bravely leading the People's Liberation Army in annihilating the Chiang bandits and protecting the factory locomotives intact, I was very happy. The railway, which had been under Kuomintang rule for more than two years, has now been returned to the people. Your spirit of bravely completing such an important task is worthy of our working class to learn from.

　　Recalling two years ago, we were still working together, living that democratic life, how happy it was! Since the Kuomintang occupied it, most of you workers were completely unemployed, enduring more than two years of dark life. Compared to what you see and experience today and during the Kuomintang rule, it is truly two different worlds: at that time, most of you were unemployed, and freedom of speech and action was restricted; but in the railway under the control of the people, unemployed workers have fully resumed work. Today, our working class must raise our awareness, strengthen our political and cultural learning, improve our skills, increase production, support the front lines, defeat the reactionary Chiang Kai-shek as soon as possible, and build a new, democratic, and prosperous China. Only by advancing under the banner of Mao Zedong can we have a bright future! I wish you progress in your studies!

　　寄给英勇的康庄铁路工人郭英芳、魏小江、刘永全三位同志：
    本月四日，在人民日报上读到，你们三人英勇地带领着解放军歼灭蒋匪，和保护工厂机车完整无损的消息后，我非常的高兴。被国民党统治二年多的铁路，今天又归还人民所有了。象你们这样英勇地完成了这样重大任务的精神，值得我们工人阶级学习。
    回忆二年以前，我们还在一同工作，过着那民主生活，多么快乐呀！自从国民党侵占后，你们大部工人完全失业了，重度了二年多黑暗的生活，在今天你们所见到和所受到的和国民党统治时期来比，真是两个不同的世界：那时你们大部失业了，言语行动不得自由；而在人民掌握的铁路中，失业的工人完全恢复工作了。今天我们工人阶级要提高觉悟，加强政治文化学习，提高技术，增加生产，支援前线，早日打垮反动派蒋介石，建立民主富强的新中国。我们只有在毛泽东的旗帜下前进，才有光明的前途！祝你们学习进步！
