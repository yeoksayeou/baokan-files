Several Suggestions for Reforming Stilt Yangko
	Chaha'er Provincial Sixth District Commissioner's Office Propaganda Committee

	Stilt Yangko is a relatively common form of folk cultural entertainment. It takes place in squares and streets. The organization is short and simple, the songs and dances are also simple, and the performance time and the number of audiences are very flexible. The lyrics are mostly local stories, so the masses easily accept it. However, the content and form are mostly erotic, feudal, and superstitious, and urgently need to be reformed. Our opinions are:

	I. Regarding the content of the lyrics: It should reflect the current living conditions of the masses after the innovation, and the lewd and superstitious content must be seriously eliminated. The replacement of these lyrics should mobilize everyone to create them. The emotions should be healthy and joyful, in order to educate the masses and inspire their enthusiasm for production and supporting the front lines. The choice of tunes and the matching of words should be coordinated (do not match the soft "Going to the West Exit" tune with lyrics about the People's Liberation Army's mighty and heroic attack). The content of the lyrics should be based on actual movements to guide the masses in the correct direction (that is, according to the nature of the region, "new, old" ... the actual living conditions of the masses and the Party's policies to educate, improve, and transform the thinking of the masses). There should be fewer political dogmas that are inconsistent with the local objective situation. The themes should include production and construction, supporting the front lines, the relationship between the Communist Party and the people, the crimes of the Chiang Kai-shek bandits, the American imperialist aggression, the Party's various policies, the liberation of the people, economic prosperity, family harmony, supporting the army and giving preferential treatment to military families, the relationship between the army and the people, exchanging labor and mutual assistance, improving culture, freedom of marriage, women's liberation, breaking feudal superstitions, etc.

	II. Regarding makeup: It should be based on the content and roles of the performance to realistically apply makeup. As mentioned earlier, our performances reflect the current novel lifestyle of the masses, so the makeup should also be based on the content. If the opposite is true, people are singing "the masses support the front lines" while being made up as a group of Fahai, Xu Xian, Qing Snake, and Bai Snake, this is absolutely not suitable and is likely to cause adverse effects. For example, if we sing "family harmony" but put on makeup as a fisherman, a silly boy, and a rogue woman, how can this represent the typical protagonist of the new society? Therefore, the makeup should be based on the content and roles of the performance, using modern clothes, reflecting the real life of the masses, so the roles of the makeup should also be characters of the new era. As for the requirement of bright and beautiful makeup, that is not impossible, but the problem is not to wear tight skirts, ancient costumes, braids, and bind three-inch golden lilies, or wear a watch and glasses, holding a small brocade fan, with a powdered face and oily hair, and lips painted like a dead child, like a female rogue. In the past, these women were made up to flirt and sing lewd tunes, but today we are completely different. If we create a woman with short hair and unbound feet, slightly applying rouge (or not applying rouge), wearing the current bright clothes of women, what should be the audience's emotional view? Such makeup is probably no less inferior than feudal rogues, right? Therefore, the typical characteristics represented by each role in the makeup must be grasped, do not deviate from the culture of reality, but be fashionable, novel, bright, simple, beautiful, and healthy. As for dressing up as a group of beggars to show the suffering of the poor, it is also divorced from real life. Therefore, our makeup should be realistic makeup.

	III. Regarding the performance form: We should promote street drama forms with strong storytelling, not simply for entertainment and excitement, but should use short street dramas with educational significance, so that the audience will not feel dry and tasteless after watching. It is not possible to sing ditties and ballads, and dialogues can also be used, but old-fashioned, generalized performances that make people disgusted should be avoided, such as Chiang Kai-shek, American imperialism, workers, peasants, soldiers, students, and merchants regardless of any content. The main characters and supporting characters should be arranged according to the main content of the performance. The form should be diversified and popular with the masses. If there are many stilt Yangko teams in a square that are all workers, peasants, soldiers, students, and merchants, what should be the mood of the masses? Therefore, the variety of forms can also increase the audience's interest. Regarding performance techniques, we should not restrict them. If a stilt team comes up with a somersault that wins the audience's applause and praise, and also sings new lyrics and tunes, that would be great.

	The above points are only our preliminary suggestions for reform. Due to our lack of experience and knowledge in this area, errors are inevitable. Please give more criticism and guidance from all walks of life.

　　改造高跷秧歌的几点意见
    察哈尔省六专署宣传委员会
    高跷秧歌是民间文化娱乐活动中较普遍的一种形式，它活动于广场街头，组织既短小，歌舞也简单，演出的时间和观众多寡的伸缩性也很大的，唱词多地方性的故事，故群众也易于接受。但其中内容形式多是色情封建和迷信、急需加以改造。我们的意见：
    一、在唱词的内容上：应该是反映群众目前革新后的生活状况，必须认真革除淫荡迷信的内容。此唱词的改换应发动大家去创作，感情应该健康愉快，以此教育群众和鼓舞其生产支前斗争的情绪。曲调的选择和配词应协调（不能把软绵绵的走西口调去配上解放军千军万马汹涌英武大学进攻的词）。歌词的内容应多根据实际运动指导群众正确前进的方向（也就是根据地区的性质“新、老”……群众生活的实际状况和党的政策教育提高和改造群众的思想）。少闹和当地客观情况不符的政治教条。其主题应该包括生产建设，支援前线，共产党和人民的关系，蒋匪的罪恶，美国帝国主义侵略，党的各种政策，人民翻身，经济繁荣，家庭和睦，拥军优待军属，军民关系，拨工互助，提高文化，婚姻自由，妇女解放，破除封建迷信等等。
    二、在化装上：应该是根据演出节目的内容角色去切实的化装，前面说过，我们的演唱是反映目前群众的新颖的生活方式，所以化装也应该根据内容去作，如与此相反，人们演唱的是“群众支援前线”而化装了一伙法海、许仙、青白蛇这是绝不相衬，且易于引起反作用的。再如我们演唱的是“家庭和睦”而化装了渔翁、傻小、流氓女人这怎么能代表新社会的典型主角呢？所以应该根据演出节目内容角色去化以时装，反映的是现实的群众生活，所以化装的角色也应该是新时代的人物。至于化装时要求鲜艳漂亮那倒不是不可，而问题是在不要紧裙束带古装编辫再绑上个三寸金莲，或者是，手表眼镜叨烟卷，手中拿着小锦扇，粉面油头，嘴唇抹的象吃了死孩子似的女流氓。过去化装这些女人是准备飞眼吊膀从他们口里唱淫荡词调的，而今天我们则完全不同了，假如化出一个剪发放足，稍擦脂粉（或者不擦脂粉）穿上现时女人鲜艳服装，观众的感情看法又该是如何呢？这样的化装大概不比封建流氓减色的吧？所以化装上各个角色所代表的典型特点要掌握住，不要脱离现实的文化，要时装新颖，鲜艳，朴素，美丽和健康。至于为了表现穷人的苦而化装成一伙讨吃的叫化子，也是脱离现实生活的。故我们的化装应是现实主义的化装。
    三、在演出形式上：应多提倡故事性强的街头剧形式，不要单纯为了娱乐哄火热闹，而应以有教育意义的短小的街头剧，使观众看了，不至于干燥无味。不能演唱歌调快板，用对话形式亦可，但应忌老一套一般化使人生厌的出演法，如不管任何内容也一定是蒋介石、美帝国主义、工农兵学商。应根据演出的主要内容去安排主角与配角。形式应是群众喜闻乐见的多样化的形式，假如在一个广场中有许多高跷秧歌队都是工农兵学商，群众的情绪该是如何。故形式的多种多样也能增加观众的兴趣。关于演出的技术，我们不应限制，如果一个高跷队来了一个鹞子翻身能获得观众的贺采称赞，而又唱出了新的词曲内容，那也很好。
    以上各点仅是我们所提出的初步改造意见，由于我们对此经验知识的缺乏，其中差错在所难免，请各界爱好者多批评指教。
