Title: Key Villages in Jianping Everywhere Have Study Groups

Learning among Jianping district-level cadres used to be a very weak link. Since the county-wide land reform and Party rectification meetings concluded in early January, and the decision to emphasize learning was communicated, it has aroused everyone's attention to learning. Cadres at all levels are now consciously making time to study in the mornings. Cadres remaining in the district mostly study collectively, while cadres working in the villages study collectively or individually within their respective villages. All thirty-three key villages in the county have a study group. For example, the work team in Changsang Village, First District, conducts its studies in this way. In addition to studying "Carry the Revolution Through to the End," they also study the Party branch materials. The difficulties encountered in learning are: the district lacks people with a high level of theoretical knowledge, and the history of social development is too profound and difficult to understand.

　　建屏各地重点村
  　村村都有学习组
    建屏区级干部的学习，在过去是顶弱的一环，自一月初全县结束土地改革与整党会议，传达了学习的决定后，引起了大家对学习的重视。各级干部在早上都自动抓紧学习，留区干部早上大部集体研究，下乡干部则以所在村为单位集体或个人进行学习。全县三十三个重点村，每村都有一个学习小组。如一区长桑村的工作组，就是这样进行学习的。除学习了“将革命进行到底”外，还学了支部教材。学习中的困难是：区里缺少理论程度高的人，社会发展史太深，不易懂。
