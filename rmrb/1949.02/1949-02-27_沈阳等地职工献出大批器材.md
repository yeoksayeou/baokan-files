　　Xinhua News Agency, Shenyang, February 25th: Due to the effective methods adopted by the People's Government to enhance the political awareness of employees, and the rewarding of the first batch of equipment donors, employees of public enterprises in Shenyang, Anshan, Fushun, Benxi, Fuxin and other places continue to donate large quantities of equipment. In the week from the 7th to the 14th of this month, Shenyang Machine Factory No. 1 alone had more than 300 workers donate over 1,000 pieces of various equipment, many of which are extremely valuable and necessary for the current resumption of production, but difficult to purchase. Under the slogan of "Protect the Factory, Build the Factory," 74 employees, including Che Zi'an of the Sujiatun Locomotive Depot, successively donated 261 pieces of various equipment, worth approximately 11 million Northeast currency. In the twenty days from January 15th to February 5th, employees in Anshan City donated 210,000 pieces of equipment, including 531 electric rollers alone. After seeing the electrical equipment donated by Xinhua District in the city, an expert estimated that the city's electrical repair work could be shortened by one month as a result. In the twenty days from December 28th of last year to January 18th of this year, Fushun Coal Mine already had 4,921 employees donate over 42,800 pieces of equipment, estimated to be worth at least 1 billion Northeast currency. As of the end of December last year, Benxi Special Steel Plant already had 119 workers donate over 4,000 pieces of equipment. After holding a mine-loving conference on January 27th, Fuxin Coal Mine had 112 employees donate over 1,600 pieces of equipment. The main reason why the donation of equipment in various places was able to form a mass movement is that the degree of political awareness of the employees has been improved. Beforehand, meetings were held in various factories and mines, and slogans such as protecting the factory, loving the factory, and building the factory were put forward for the employees to fully discuss their relationship with the factory, and to realize that today the employees are the masters of the country. The "February 7th" Commemoration Assembly specifically mobilized for the donation of equipment, so after "February 7th" in Shenyang, employees donated even more enthusiastically. At the same time, the factories and mines gave appropriate bonuses and commendations to the first batch of employees who donated equipment, breaking the employees' concerns that they would be thoroughly investigated after donating equipment, and making them understand that the People's Government's attitude towards employees is completely different from that of the Kuomintang.

　　沈阳等地职工献出大批器材
    【新华社沈阳二十五日电】由于人民政府采取有效方法提高了职工的政治觉悟，并奖励了首批献纳器材者，沈阳、鞍山、抚顺、本溪、阜新等地公营企业的职工继续献出大批器材。沈阳机器第一厂在本月七日至十四日的一周间，即有三百多工人献纳各种器材一千余件，其中有很多极珍贵的器材，为目前恢复生产中所必需而又不易买到的。苏家屯机务段车子安等七十四名职工在“护厂、建厂”的口号下先后献出各种器材二百六十一件，约值东北券一千一百余万元。鞍山市职工在上月十五日至本月五日二十天中，献出器材二十一万件，其中仅电滚就有五百三十一个。某专家看到了该市新华区献纳的电气器材后，估计该市电气修复工作可因此缩短一个月。抚顺煤矿在去年十二月二十八日至上月十八日二十天中，已有四千九百二十一名职工献出器材四万二千八百余件，估计最少值东北券十亿元。本溪特殊钢厂截至去年十二月底止，已有一百一十九名工人献出器材四千余件。阜新煤矿在上月二十七日召开爱矿大会后，全厂一百一十二名职工献纳器材一千六百余件。这次各地的献纳器材所以能够形成一个群众性的运动，主要原因在于职工的政治觉悟程度提高。事前各工厂、矿山都曾举行会议，提出护厂爱厂建厂等口号由职工们充分讨论他们和工厂的关系，认识到今天职工已是国家的主人翁。“二七”纪念的集会，更特别进行了献纳器材的动员，所以沈阳在“二七”以后，职工们献纳更加踊跃。同时，各厂矿对首批献纳器材的职工给了适当的奖金和表扬，打破了职工们怕献出器材后被寻根究底的顾虑，使他们了解到人民政府对待职工的态度与国民党完全两样。
