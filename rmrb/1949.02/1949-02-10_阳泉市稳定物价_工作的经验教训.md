　　Yangquan City's Work to Stabilize Prices
  　Experiences and Lessons
    Lü Guangming
    In the past month, Yangquan City experienced two major price fluctuations for staples like rice and flour. The first occurred around December 20th of last year, lasting until early January of this year. The price of millet rose from 570 Jichaobi (冀钞, hereafter) per jin to 820 Jichaobi, while the price of white flour rose from 720 Jichaobi per jin to 1,300 Jichaobi. The second occurred from January 15th to 21st, with millet rising from 850 Jichaobi per jin to 1,100 Jichaobi, and white flour rising from 1,400 Jichaobi per jin to 2,100 Jichaobi. Given that the city is an industrial and mining area with very little grain production, relying heavily on imports from other regions, the city's state-owned stores sold large quantities of various grains to stabilize prices and ensure the supply of essential goods for workers and residents. However, in this sale, no prior investigation or research was conducted, and there was a lack of strong cooperation from relevant departments in the city, as well as a lack of management and control over private merchants. The phenomenon of hoarding and speculation by private merchants was very serious. Before the Gregorian New Year, it was discovered that the Jushun and Chengji grain stores, and the Yongcheng Jiu, Wanzhong, Yongsheng, and Qingyuan warehouses alone, had stockpiled as much as 400,000 jin of white flour. At that time, in order to stabilize prices, 30,000 to 40,000 jin of grain were sold daily, with a maximum of 70,000 jin. Apart from some iron smelters in nearby rural areas and the three or two mining factories in the city with cooperatives benefiting to some extent, the majority was obtained by speculative merchants and grain dealers. Many working people said: "The benefits don't reach us. The government doesn't sell retail, it's at least thirty or fifty jin as a minimum. For households like us who earn and eat as we go, we don't have that much money, and we don't have that much time to queue up and wait to buy, so we just watch even if it's cheap."
    In order to truly achieve price stability, before the Gregorian New Year, the Municipal Party Committee convened a meeting of relevant departments to discuss and made decisions to continue selling goods, tighten currency circulation, and strengthen administrative management. In the past month, the bank has not only suspended all loans, but also recovered 250 million Jichaobi in overdrafts and matured loans; and in accordance with the law, it has frozen more than 80 million Jichaobi in deposits of public institutions and stores in private banks. The Tax Bureau also started collecting the 1948 industrial and commercial tax on January 1st, and by January 15th, it had collected 80% of the total annual amount. However, the decision to fix the price of one jin of rice at 580 Jichaobi to stimulate taxpayers to pay quickly within half a month was wrong. Because with prices rising daily, most taxpayers delayed until the 14th or 15th. At that time, the price of rice had risen to 800 or 900 Jichaobi per jin, so the collection of industrial and commercial tax not only failed to help tighten currency circulation, but also greatly lost state treasury revenue.
    The Jinzhong Company's Hongyang Store moved from Pingding City to Yangquan City on January 10th, responsible for stabilizing prices in the city. They implemented a method of directly distributing necessities to consumers, which was more popular with the masses. By January 15th, the store had completed the subsidized distribution to 13,600 workers and their families in the city, including seventeen state-owned mining factories, and 4,400 people in the urban area, for half a month to ten days per person. The store also planned to distribute 1.6 million jin of food grain in Yangquan every month, and another 400,000 jin of grain for retail sales. From January 10th to 24th, the retail department sold 400,000 jin of salt alone, but the benefits obtained by the masses were still not significant, and it was easy for unscrupulous merchants to profit. Because the department still stipulated that there was no retail, except for soybeans and yellow millet, which had a minimum of thirty or twenty jin, most other rice, flour, and salt were over fifty jin, and foreign flour was calculated by the bag. In the absence of supply and marketing and consumer cooperatives, general small producers and direct consumers still could not access them.
    Looking at these two price stabilization efforts, the following experiences and lessons should be drawn:
    (1) The relevant departments' coordination with the state-owned stores' price stabilization work was very inconsistent. The Public Security Bureau only recently began to pay attention to the illegal activities of speculative merchants, and did not take any action against the large-scale hoarding that had already been discovered. The Industry and Commerce Bureau failed to pay timely attention to market investigation and research, and only began to conduct planned investigation work after the second price stabilization. Although the municipal leaders had made two resolutions on price stabilization, some departments did not seriously and timely implement them. "Afraid of affecting trade freedom" is a manifestation of right-leaning thinking and lack of organization and discipline.
    (2) Yangquan is an industrial and mining area with very little local grain production, relying heavily on imports from other regions, so the city's grain prices are most easily affected by fluctuations; in order to ensure the import of necessary food grain, the city's grain price must be slightly higher than the price in grain-producing areas. If it is pressed too low, it will inevitably cause backflow. According to the Shijiazhuang Daily on January 26th: "14,000 jin of miscellaneous grains flowed into Shouyang and Yangquan," which is a factual illustration. For this reason, state-owned stores should have regular, well-informed, and thorough economic intelligence work, to prevent price fluctuations in advance, and take the initiative to control appropriate prices in the city, giving private merchants a certain degree of normal profit. Under the leadership of state-owned stores, drive private merchants to sell necessities to meet the needs of the market. Otherwise, only the state-owned stores will be dancing naked, which cannot solve all the supply problems, and the low-priced goods are easily taken advantage of by speculative merchants. In addition, in order to ensure the necessities of life for workers, residents, and small producers, it is necessary to quickly establish supply and marketing and consumer cooperatives, and unite the vast number of small producers around the state-owned economy. Before the establishment and improvement of cooperatives, it is necessary to set up retail outlets, or entrust private stores, give them certain benefits, and sell them at the state-owned store's listed price after necessary procedures, so that the benefits can fall into the hands of consumers.

　　阳泉市稳定物价
  　工作的经验教训
    吕光明
    阳泉市在近一个月来，米面等价格曾经两次大波动。第一次是在去年十二月二十日左右起，到今年一月初。小米每市斤由五百七十元冀钞（下同）跃进到八百二十元，白面每市斤由七百二十元跃进到一千三百元。第二次是一月十五日到二十一日，小米每市斤由八百五十元上涨到一千一百元，白面每市斤由一千四百元上涨到二千一百元。按该市为工矿区，产粮甚少，多依赖外地输入。为平稳物价，保障工人和市民生活必需品的供给，该市公营商店曾大量抛售各种米粮。但在此次抛售中，事先未作调查研究，亦未能得到该市有关部门的有力配合，对私商缺乏管理，控制。私商囤积居奇的现象是很严重的。阳历年前发现仅该市聚顺、成记两家粮店，及永成九、万众、永盛、庆元四家货栈，白面一项竟囤积到四十万斤之多。当时为平抑物价，每天售出米粮三、四万斤，最高时达七万斤，除附近乡间一些铁炉户及该市有合作社的三、二矿厂得到一部分实惠外，大部为投机商人及粮贩所得。许多劳苦群众则说：“好处到不了我们身上。公家不零卖，至少也是三五十斤起码，象我们现挣现吃的户，没有那么多的钱，又没有那么多的工夫排队等着买，多便宜也是干看着。”
    为真正达到平稳物价，阳历年前，市委召集各有关部门开会讨论后，作了继续抛售物资，紧缩筹码，加强行政管理等决定。在近一个月来，银行除暂停一切贷款外，收回透支与到期贷款计二亿五千万元；并依法冻结了公营机关商店在私人银号存款计八千余万元。税务局亦于一月一日起开征一九四八年度工商税，至一月十五日，已征收全年总额的百分之八十。但征收中规定一市斤米固定折价五百八十元，以刺激纳税限半个月内迅速交齐的决定则是错误的。因物价日趋上涨的情况下，交税者多拖延至十四、五日。而当时米价已涨到每市斤八、九百元，因此工商税的征收不仅未达到有利于紧缩筹码，且大大亏损了国库收入。
    晋中公司宏阳商店，一月十日由平定城迁至阳泉市，负责在该市平稳物价。他们实行了将必需品直接配售给消费者的办法，较得群众拥护。至一月十五日，该店完成了对该市包括十七个公营矿厂一万三千六百个工人与家属及市区四千四百人，每人半月至十天的贱价配售。该店并准备每月在阳泉配售一百六十万斤食粮，另以四十万斤粮食作门市售出，从一月十日到二十四日，门市部光盐一项就售出了四十万斤，但群众所得实惠仍不大，且便于奸商套取。因该部仍规定不零售，除黄豆、黄米由三、二十斤起码外，其他米面盐多在五十斤以上，洋面则以袋计。在供销、消费合作社未建立的情况下，一般小生产者，直接消费者仍无法问津。
    综观这两次平稳物价工作，应得出如下经验教训：
    （一）有关部门对配合公营商店的平稳物价工作，步调很不一致。公安局最近才开始注意投机奸商的非法行动，对已经发现的大规模囤积，未加任何处理；工商局未能及时注意市场的调查研究，一直到第二次平稳物价以后，才开始有计划的进行调查工作，市级领导虽有过两次平稳物价的决议，但有的部门未认真及时执行。“怕影响贸易自由”，这是一种右倾思想和无组织无纪律的表现。
    （二）阳泉系工矿区，本地产粮极少，多依赖外地输入，故该市粮价最易受波动；为保证必要食粮的输入，该市在粮价掌握上必须稍高于产粮区的价格。如压得过低，势必引起倒流。据一月二十六日石家庄日报载：“寿阳、阳泉流入杂粮一万四千斤”这就是事实的说明。为此，公营商店应有经常的、灵通的、周密的经济情报工作，对物价波动做事前的防范，主动掌握本市适当价格，予私商以一定限度的正常利润。在公营商店的带领下，带动私商，出售必需品，以供应市场之所需。否则，只有公营商店裸体跳舞，既不能解决全部供给问题，而低价抛售之物资，反易为投机商人从中取利。另外，为保证工人、市民与小生产者的生活必需品，必须迅速建立供销与消费合作社，把广大小生产者团结在国营经济的周围。在合作社未建立与健全之前，必须设立门户零售，或委托私人商店，给以一定好处，经必要手续按公营商店牌价出售，才能使实惠落入消费者之手。
