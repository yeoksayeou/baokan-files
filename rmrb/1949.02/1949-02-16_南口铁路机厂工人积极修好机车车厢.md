　　Nankou Railway Machinery Plant Workers
  　Actively Repair Locomotives and Carriages
    Nankou is a large station on the Ping-Sui Railway's Ping-Zhang section and has been a strategic location since ancient times. Of the town's 15,000 residents, 1,260 are railway machinery plant workers. Including their families, they account for two-thirds of the town's population. The machinery plant is an important repair facility for locomotives and carriages on the Ping-Sui Railway. Damaged vehicles from the Ping-Zhang section are almost all repaired here.
    On December 12th last year, when our army liberated the town, all factories, shops, and schools were completely protected thanks to the rapid advance of the People's Liberation Army and the workers' determined efforts. After completing the defense of their own machinery plant, the workers, under the leadership of their class's political party – the Communist Party – resumed work quickly with a high degree of labor enthusiasm to support the Pingjin front. By 2:00 PM on the 18th, they had completed the opening of the Kangzhuang to Qinghuayuan line. In five days, in addition to repairing nine locomotives and carriages, they also voluntarily repaired a large number of automobiles, carts, and weapons. To raise the workers' class consciousness and help them establish a new attitude toward labor, a workers' night school was also established, where the workers demonstrated a high degree of enthusiasm for learning. Based on ideological awareness, the preparatory committee for the workers' union has also been established so that workers can form their own class organization.

　　南口铁路机厂工人
  　积极修好机车车厢
    南口是平绥线上平张段的一个大车站，自古就是一个战略要地。全镇一万五千人口中，有一千二百六十个铁路机厂工人，再加上工人们的家属，就占去全镇人口的三分之二。机厂对于平绥路上的机车和车厢，是一个重要的修理场所，平张段的残废车辆，差不多全由此厂修理。
    去年十二月十二日，当我军解放该镇时，全镇的工厂、商店、学校，在解放军迅速进军和工人群众奋力保护之下，完好无缺地被保卫下来了。当完成了自己机厂的保卫工作以后，工人群众在自己阶级政党——共产党——的领导下，为着支援平津前线，又以高度的劳动热忱，很快复工，到十八日下午二时，便完成了康庄至清华园的通车。在五天中，除把九辆机车，车厢修理完竣外，还自动地修理了大量的汽车、大车和武器。为着提高工人群众的阶级觉悟，为着帮助他们树立新的劳动态度，还设立了工人夜校，在这里，工人发挥了自己高度的学习热情。在思想觉悟的基础上，工人们为着成立自己的阶级组织，工会筹备委员会亦已建立起来。
