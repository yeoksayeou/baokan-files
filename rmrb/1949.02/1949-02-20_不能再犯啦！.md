　　We Can't Make That Mistake Again!
　　Méi Cūn
　　My name is Lǐ Zhèngguó, and I am a soldier in the guard company.
　　One afternoon, the northwest wind was howling. My squad leader and I were returning from Shijiazhuang. We hadn't had a good breakfast, and we had been running around all day. Plus, walking over ten miles against the cold wind was making my legs ache, my body cold, and my stomach empty. When we reached the Dà Guō Village train station, the squad leader said:
　　"Zhèngguó, shall we go into a small shop to warm up?" I said, "Sure, I can't take it anymore!"
　　So we went into a small restaurant and sat down.
　　Taking this opportunity, I took out the receipts for the things I bought for the public and arranged them on the table.
　　The squad leader picked up a receipt and looked at it for a long time, then smiled and said to me:
　　"Zhèngguó, let's think of a way to get a free meal from the public, shall we?"
　　My heart skipped a beat, and I immediately thought of something—
　　That was before the rectification campaign, when the squad leader and I went to the market in Yúdǐ to buy bran and fine powder. There was some leftover money, and the squad leader said:
　　"Shall we use this leftover money to buy cigarettes?"
　　At the time, I vaguely knew that it was wrong to use public funds to buy cigarettes. But then I thought: he is the squad leader and a Party member, so if he suggests it, he'll take responsibility. If I oppose him, I'll offend him. So I said:
　　"You decide, I have no opinion."
　　As a result, he bought a pack and handed me one. I reluctantly took it and smoked it.
　　During the rectification campaign, the comrades in the squad discussed and said that spending public funds privately is embezzlement and a violation of discipline. I also realized this. Thinking about the cigarette incident, I felt very wrong. I reflected for half the night, and the next day at the group meeting, I said:
　　"We are soldiers of the people and should be loyal and reliable to the Party and the people. The leadership trusts us and sends us out to do work, but we secretly spend public money privately. How can we be worthy of the people and the leadership? Don't think that a pack of cigarettes is a small matter. If this kind of thinking exists, small mistakes will turn into big mistakes. At that time, the squad leader suggested it, and I should have resolutely stopped him. No matter who he is, if his behavior is harmful to the people, I should oppose it. But I didn't stop him, and I even smoked one, which was committing liberalism, not standing firm!…."
　　I was saddened by this for several days. I often thought: my family is a middle peasant, and my background is good. I volunteered to join the army three or four years ago. During the land reform study, I have already clearly recognized who I am working for, and I have also expressed my determination to honestly serve the people to the end! Why can't I stand firm now? Why am I still running with bad thoughts? Besides, since joining the army, I have always been clean. The leadership sends me out to buy this and that, and I have never had any crooked thoughts—wanting to spend public money privately. When buying things for the public, I have to write a receipt for every penny, fearing that the procedures will not be clear. When walking from Jì County to Yǒngnián, carrying more than a million in public funds (to buy pigs along the way), other comrades said, "We're hungry, let's buy a steamed bun with public money?" I was actually very hungry too; but I said, "No, public funds cannot be spent casually!" Because I am loyal and reliable, the leadership trusts me. So why was I confused this time!?…
　　Even now, every time I think about the cigarette incident, I regret it terribly. I have already made up my mind: "If I encounter this kind of thing again, I must stand firm! I won't commit the offense myself, and I won't let others commit it either; if he doesn't listen to my advice, I will report it to the leadership, anyway, I can't run with bad thoughts again!…"
　　Thinking of this, I said in my heart, "Now I have encountered this kind of thing again! I must stand firm!"
　　So I said sternly:
　　"No! This is embezzlement, we can't make that mistake again!"
　　He said, "Hey, aren't we on a business trip for the public? What's wrong with buying something to eat when we're hungry?"
　　I said, "We are serving the people, and it is right to be on a business trip for the public. The public takes care of food and clothing, so there's nothing to worry about. What else do you want? How can you always think about spending public money? Have you forgotten about the cigarette incident? You just reflected on it during the rectification campaign, but you've already forgotten? You have to change after reflecting, if you just reflect and then it's like nothing happened, how can you progress? Last time you used public funds to buy cigarettes, and this time you want to use public funds to buy food. Each time the mistake is bigger than the last, how can that be allowed!? Think about it carefully, anyway, I'm not running with you anymore!…"
　　The squad leader listened to my words, lowered his head and thought for a while, then blushed and said:
　　"Right! We can't, my thinking is wrong!…"
　　Back at the team, I reported this matter to the platoon leader.

### 不能再犯啦！

　　不能再犯啦！
    梅村
    我叫李正国，是警卫连的战士。
    有一天下午，西北风呜呜的吼着。我和我们班长从石家庄回来。早饭本没吃好：两腿又不停地跑了一天；再加上顶头冷风走了十几里，真是两腿酸，身上凉，肚里饿。走到大郭村车站，班长说：
    “正国，咱到小铺里暖暖吧？”我说：“行，我早就受不住啦！”
    我们俩就走进一家小饭铺，坐下来。
    趁这机会，我掏出给公家买东西的单据，放在桌上整理。
    班长拿起一个单据端相了好久；笑着对我说：
    “正国，咱们想个办法吃公家一顿吧？”
    我心里一跳，马上想起一件事情——
    那是整纪以前，我和班长到于底集上买麸子，末子，还剩些零钱，班长说：
    “咱们拿这零钱买纸烟抽吧？”
    我当时模模糊糊知道：拿公款买烟抽是不对的。可是又一想：他是班长，又是党员，他提出来的，责任他负，咱一定要反对他，得罪人。我就说：
    “你看着办吧，我没意见。”
    结果，他买了一盒；递给我一根，我也马马虎虎接过来抽了。
    到整纪的时候，班里同志们讨论，说私自花公款是贪污，是违犯纪律。我也认识到这一点。想起买烟的事，感觉很不对。晚上反省了半夜，第二天小组会上。我说：
    “咱们是人民的战士，应该对党对人民忠实可靠。上级信任咱，派咱出去干工作，咱就偷偷摸摸私自花公家钱，这怎么对得起人民和上级？不要看一盒纸烟事小，有这种思想存在，就会由小错变大错。那时候班长提出来，我应该坚决阻止。不管他是谁，他的行为对人民有害，就应该反对。而我没阻拦他，还跟着抽了一根，是犯了自由主义，立场没站稳！……。”
    为这事，我难过了好几天。时常想：咱家是个中农，成份也不错。自愿参军三四年了。土地改革学习中，已经认清楚是为谁干的，也表示了决心：要老老实实为人民服务到底！为啥到现在立场还站不稳？还跟着坏的思想跑？再说：自从参军以来，咱一直是两手清白的，上级派出去买这买那，从来没生过歪心眼——想私自花公家的钱。给公家买东西，支一分钱，都要打条子，恐怕手绩弄不清楚。从冀县往永年走，带着公款一百多万（沿路买猪），别的同志说：“肚子饿了，拿公家钱买个馍吃吧？”我其实也很饿了；但是我说：“不行，公款不能随便花！”因为忠实可靠，上级也对咱放心。而这次为啥糊涂住啦！？……
    一直到现在，每次想起买烟的事，我都后悔的不行。我早已拿定主意：“再遇到这种事，一定要站稳立场！自个不犯，也不叫别人犯；提意见他不听，回去报告上级，反正不能再跟着坏思想跑！……”
    想到这里，我心里说：“现在又遇到这种事啦！要站稳立场呀！”
    我就严正地说：
    “不能！这是贪污行为，可不能再犯啦！”
    他说：“咳，咱为公家出差吗，肚子饿了买点吃的有啥？”
    我说：“咱为人民服务哩，为公家出差是应该的。公家管吃管穿，啥也不愁，你还要怎样？动不动就想花公款，那怎么行？你忘记你买烟的事啦？整纪中刚反省过可又忘啦？反省以后得改咧，要是反省一下就又没事啦，那怎能进步？上次用公款买烟，这次又用公款买饭，一次比一次错的大，那还得了！？你好好想想吧，反正我是不再跟着你跑了！……”
    班长听了我的话，低头想了一阵，就红着脸说：
    “对！是不能，我这思想不对头！……”
    回到队上，我又把这件事向排长作了汇报。
