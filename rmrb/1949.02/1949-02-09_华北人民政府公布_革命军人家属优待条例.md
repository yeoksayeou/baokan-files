　　Regulations on Preferential Treatment for Families of Revolutionary Soldiers
　　[Report from this newspaper] The North China People's Government formulated the Regulations on Preferential Treatment for Families of Revolutionary Soldiers in the North China Region on January 25 and announced its implementation. The original text of the regulations is as follows:
　　Article 1. All families of revolutionary soldiers residing in the North China Region shall be entitled to the preferential treatment stipulated in these Regulations.
　　Article 2. Revolutionary soldiers (hereinafter referred to as "soldiers") in these Regulations refer to personnel with military status in the People's Liberation Army's field armies, local armies, detached guerrilla forces, rear military organs, and other military systems.
　　Article 3. Families of revolutionary soldiers (hereinafter referred to as "military families") in these Regulations refer to the soldier's wife (or husband), parents (those who have separated from the soldier may also be considered military families), children, and other direct relatives living together in the same household, as well as younger siblings under the age of sixteen who rely on the soldier for their livelihood, or other military relatives who relied on the soldier for upbringing from a young age and now must rely on the soldier for their livelihood.
　　Female soldiers can choose to have preferential treatment extended to their maternal or paternal family according to their own wishes.
　　Article 4. Military families shall be entitled to the following preferential treatments:
　　(1) In the land reform, appropriate consideration should be given to poor military families when distributing land, grain, and property.
　　(2) When distributing, renting, lending, or selling public land, houses, venues, and utensils, military families shall have the priority to obtain, rent, borrow, or purchase them under the same conditions as the masses.
　　(3) Children of poor military families shall have priority in enjoying public expense treatment when entering school under the same conditions as the masses.
　　(4) Public factories and shops should give priority to employing military families under the same conditions as the masses.
　　(5) Poor military families who go to public health institutions for medical treatment may have their medical expenses reduced or waived at the discretion of the district government, upon verification.
　　(6) When providing general social relief and government-sponsored grain and loan programs, poor military families who meet the requirements shall have the priority to receive and borrow.
　　(7) Respect military families and enhance their social status, such as congratulating them on meritorious services, hanging honorary plaques, sending regards during important festivals, and setting up seats for military families at meetings.
　　Article 5. The care for the lives of military families should focus on organizing their production and establishing their households. Organize military families to participate in various agricultural and sideline productions, help solve difficulties in production, so that their land yield is not lower than the harvest of ordinary farmers in the local area, so as to achieve a living standard for military families equivalent to the living standard of ordinary farmers in the local area. Those who lack labor and are unable to hire people to cultivate the land shall be cultivated on their behalf by the village (or township) government after being approved by the village people's representative meeting. The principles of substitute cultivation are as follows:
　　(1) Military families who have land but lack labor should try to organize and mobilize military families to participate in agricultural labor or adopt labor exchange to solve part of their labor problems; if it is still insufficient, they can enjoy substitute cultivation.
　　(2) Military families with more land who can maintain their livelihood by renting out or hiring people to cultivate the land will not be provided with substitute cultivation. Those who have industrial, commercial and other income to maintain their livelihood will also not be provided with substitute cultivation. Those who are insufficient can be given appropriate substitute cultivation.
　　(3) The maximum amount of land cultivated on behalf of each military family shall not exceed the number of mu of land that each labor force in the entire village should cultivate (that is, the total number of mu of land in the entire village divided by the existing labor force plus the labor force participating in the military).
　　Article 6. Subsidies in kind for military families may be implemented in accordance with the following provisions due to different regional conditions:
　　(1) In areas where land reform has been completed, the method of in-kind subsidies shall be abolished; the administrative office may allocate a certain amount of military grain to the county, which shall be directly controlled by the county government to be responsible for solving the living problems of individual military families who have no labor force and are extremely poor, helpless, old, disabled, and sick.
　　(2) In newly liberated areas and border areas where land reform has not been implemented or completed, and military families lack land and have no other productive capacity to support themselves, the village government shall report to the district and transfer to the county for approval, and then provide in-kind subsidies according to the following methods:
　　1. According to their annual income, the difference between the expenses necessary to maintain the minimum living standard for the whole year and the number of people who cannot support themselves will be given in-kind subsidies; for each month that the living standard is short, each person will be subsidized with twelve jin of millet.
　　2. For individual orphans, elderly, disabled, and sick people with extremely difficult living conditions, the county may approve appropriate additional subsidies.
　　3. All in-kind subsidies shall be issued quarterly (one-quarter of the annual subsidy will be issued each quarter).
　　(3) For poor military families in cities, efforts should be made to organize production and introduce occupations. Those who truly have no labor force and cannot support themselves may also be given in-kind subsidies in accordance with the provisions of Item 2 of this article. In order to take into account that urban life is different from rural areas, the amount of millet subsidized for each person per month that the living standard is short may be increased to eighteen jin.
　　Article 7. Military families must hold proof documents from the military unit at the regimental level or above in order to enjoy preferential treatment; however, due to war or geographical restrictions, if the unit's proof cannot be obtained temporarily, the village people's representative meeting or the village government may temporarily provide proof, but they shall not enjoy preferential treatment.
　　Article 8. Military families who have taken refuge in other places due to enemy persecution should be temporarily regarded as military families in the county where they reside and given appropriate resettlement. And help them organize production. Those who are particularly difficult should be given in-kind subsidies.
　　Article 9. If a soldier gloriously sacrifices in battle or dies on duty, his family shall continue to enjoy the preferential treatment of military families. However, if a soldier leaves the army and loses his military status, the preferential treatment of his family shall be terminated immediately; if a soldier deserts, the preferential treatment of his family shall be terminated from the date of desertion; after returning to the team, the preferential treatment of his military family shall be restored from the date of returning to the team.
　　Article 10. If a military family member is deprived of political rights for committing a crime, the preferential treatment that he/she should enjoy shall be suspended during the period of deprivation of political rights; if a military family member transfers the right to preferential treatment to others, it shall be invalid and the preferential treatment he/she enjoys shall be suspended.
　　Article 11. In addition to enjoying preferential treatment in accordance with the provisions of these Regulations, military families shall have the same civil rights and obligations as ordinary citizens.
　　Article 12. These Regulations shall come into effect on the date of promulgation. The Regulations on Preferential Treatment for Military Families promulgated by the former Jin-Ji-Lu-Yu Border Region Government, the Jin-Cha-Ji Border Region Administrative Committee, and governments at all levels under their jurisdiction shall be simultaneously abolished.

    第十一条　军属除依本条例之规定享受优待外，其公民权利与义务与一般公民同。
