Xinhua News Agency, East China, 3rd. The Political Department of the East China Military Region recently issued a circular commending units that conscientiously implemented urban policies and city entry discipline, calling on the entire army to learn from them. The units commended included the Jinan city entry guard unit, the 2nd squad of the 1st battalion of the 3rd regiment of the Lunan Central Military Region entering Yanzhou, the Donghai Independent Regiment and the Zhu Peng Independent Regiment entering Xinhai, and the Jiaodong units entering Yantai, among which the Jiaodong units had the most exemplary deeds. When the Jiaodong units entered Yantai, they had not eaten from the time they entered the city in the evening until the afternoon of the next day. The masses voluntarily asked to cook for the troops, but the troops politely declined. A private from the 8th company of a certain regiment picked up a watch and a gold ring and automatically turned them in. The shoes of soldier Men Zihong of the special service battalion were so broken that they could not be worn, but he did not change them despite the warehouse being full of rubber shoes. A certain squad borrowed a pot from the masses to carry it to the fortifications on the top of the mountain, but the rope broke halfway and the pot was smashed. All the soldiers in the squad seemed ashamed to face anyone and were reluctant to return. Soldier Yu Xingji was on guard duty at the ordnance repair shop when an old man brought him a bottle of wine and wanted to go in and take a piece of iron. He smiled and said, "Don't look at our People's Liberation Army like the Kuomintang army. Keep the wine for yourself, you can't have the iron!" The gun holster of the battalion commander of the special service battalion was broken. The soldiers wanted to replace it with a captured one, but he refused, and educated the soldiers saying, "All captured items must be turned over to the public."
The reason why the Jiaodong units were able to so conscientiously abide by discipline and implement policies was mainly due to thorough prior education in the units, the exemplary role of the cadres, and mutual supervision by the masses. Before entering Yantai, the units generally had the following ideological conditions: (1) Wanting to enter the city to arrest the Baojia chiefs to take revenge and settle accounts with the capitalists. (2) To broaden their horizons, make a fortune, and buy cheap things in the city. Based on these ideological conditions, they repeatedly carried out education on various policies and disciplines among cadres and soldiers through methods such as large classes, discussions, and seminars, and each person made plans for "obeying discipline" and "making meritorious contributions." In order to make this education thorough, they also held practical exercises using villages as hypothetical cities. In the hypothetical city, areas such as factories, organs, schools, churches, and shops were designated, and there were disguised people from all walks of life inside. After the troops attacked the city, these people raised various questions and asked the entering troops to answer them, in order to improve the troops' ability to deal with practical problems. Secondly, based on the actual situation in Yantai and the biases existing in the troops, they conducted practical education and launched a struggle against bad tendencies in the troops. The military control commission and the picket team were organized in the city, and control areas were divided. After the troops entered the city, except for a part stationed in the city to perform guard duties, the rest lived in the suburbs and were prohibited from free movement. During the period of martial law and taking over assets, various internal living systems of the troops were strictly enforced, and time was seized to carry out situational education, review the city entry work, and investigate the work of "turning over captured items to the public" and "obeying discipline," commend good comrades, and expose and prevent hedonistic ideas, thus promptly preventing the occurrence of biases in the troops and enhancing the troops' concept of war, so that the troops always maintained vigorous morale.
The troops entering Yantai also had shortcomings in implementing policies and discipline: such as insufficient prior preparation, no announcements were made when pacifying the people, lack of experience in managing the city, some warehouses only knew to post guards at the front door, and things were stolen from the back door. Some mechanically enforced discipline and dared not collect materials abandoned by the enemy. Individual cadres randomly fired guns and accidentally injured people.

　　胶东等部认真执行入城纪律
    ——华东军区通报表扬
    【新华社华东三日电】华东军区政治部顷通报表扬认真执行城市政策与入城纪律部队。号召全军向他们学习。受到表扬的部队有济南入城警卫部队，进入兖州的鲁中南警三团一营二连二班，进入新海的东海独立团和竹彭独立团及进入烟台的胶东部队，其中尤以胶东部队模范事迹最多。胶东部进入烟台时，从晚上进城至第二天下午尚未吃饭，群众自动要求给部队作饭吃，经该部婉言谢绝。某团八连二排附拾到一只手表，一只金戒指，自动交公。特兵营的战士门子红的鞋破得不能穿，仓库里满地胶鞋，他都不换。某班抬锅（借群众的）上山顶上的工事去，半路上绳断了，将锅打了，全班战士都好象没脸见人，懊丧得不愿回来。战士于兴集在修械所站岗，一老百姓拿一瓶酒送他，要进去拿一块铁，他笑着说：“你不要把我们解放军看成和国民党军队一样，酒，你自己留着喝吧，铁是不能给你的！”特兵营营长的枪套坏了，战士将缴获的枪套给他换，他不要，并且教育战士说：“一切缴获要归公”。
    胶东部所以能如此认真遵守纪律，执行政策，主要由于部队里事先教育深刻，干部起模范作用，群众互相监督所致。该部进入烟台之前，大体有如下思想情况：（一）想进城抓保甲长报仇，向资本家清算。（二）到城里开眼界，发洋财，买贱东西。根据这些思想情况，他们在干部及战士中，采取上大课、讨论、座谈等方式，反复进行了各种政策及纪律的教育，各人订“遵纪”“立功”计划。为使这一教育深刻，他们又举行了以村庄为假设城市的实际演习。在假设城市内划出工厂、机关、学校、教堂、商店等场所，里面都有化装了的各界人士，部队攻入城后，这些人便提出各种疑问请求入城部队解答，以此来提高部队处理实际问题能力。其次根据烟台实际情况及部队存在的偏向，在部队中又进行实际教育和展开反不良倾向斗争。市内组织军管会、纠察队、划分管制区域，部队入城后，除一部留市内担任警戒外，余均住市郊，禁止自由行动。在戒严及接管资财期间，严格部队内部各种生活制度，抓紧时间进行形势教育，检讨入城工作及清查“缴获归公”、“遵纪”工作，表扬好的同志，揭发与防止享乐思想，因此及时防止了部队偏向的发生，提高了部队的战争观念，使部队始终保持了旺盛的士气。
    入烟台部队在执行政策纪律中也还有缺点：如事先准备工作不足，安民时没有布告，缺乏管理城市经验，有的仓库只知前门放岗，东西被人从后门偷走。有的执行纪律机械，对敌人遗弃物资不敢收集。个别干部乱打枪及走火伤人等。
