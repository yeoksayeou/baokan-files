Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 16th. The Administrative Committee of the French General Confederation of Labor recently issued a public statement, calling on the French working people to expand the struggle against the "Marshall Plan." According to a TASS dispatch from Paris on the 12th: The public statement points out that the reactionary policies pursued by the French government have led to a deterioration in the living standards of the working people. The reduction in the wholesale prices of certain agricultural products has not improved their situation. The government's policy of supporting big capitalists has made the price index of manufactured goods 25 percent higher than that of agricultural products. The Administrative Committee once again demands a 25 percent increase in wages and sets the minimum wage at 15,500 francs per month. The Administrative Committee calls on all working people to actively support strikers who insist on demanding wage increases. The Administrative Committee points out that the sharp increase in the number of unemployed is the result of France's policy of subordination to the expansionist desires of American tycoons. The Administrative Committee suggests that all trade union organizations affiliated with the General Confederation of Labor establish contact with representatives of farmers and the middle class to expand the struggle against the Marshall Plan and safeguard the policy of national independence. The Administrative Committee calls on all working people to pay attention to the serious threat of a new war. The committee suggests that the working people resolutely support the clear and practical peace proposals repeatedly put forward by the Soviet Union, and calls on all trade union members to strive to unite all those who regard maintaining peace and opposing warmongers as their highest responsibility in a united anti-war front.

    【新华社陕北十六日电】法国总工会行政委员会顷发表公报，号召法国劳动人民扩大反对“马歇尔计划”的斗争。据塔斯社巴黎十二日讯：该公报指出：法政府奉行的反动政策，带来了劳动人民生活水平的恶化。某些农产品批发价格的降低，并未改善他们的境况。政府支持大资本家的政策，已使制造品价格指数较农产品价格指数高百分之二十五。行政委员会再次要求增加工资百分之二十五，并确定最低工资为每月一万五千五百法郎。行政委员会号召一切劳动人民积极支持坚持要求增加工资的罢工者。行政委员会指出失业人数的急剧增加，是法国政策从属于美国豪富的扩张欲望的后果。行政委员会建议总工会所属的一切工会组织与农民和中间阶级的代表建立联系，扩大反对马歇尔计划、维护国家独立政策的斗争。行政委员会号召一切劳动人民注意新战争的严重威胁。委员会建议劳动人民坚决支持苏联一再提出的明确而切实的和平建议，号召一切工会会员努力将一切以维护和平反对战争贩子为最高责任的人们团结在统一的反战阵线中。
