　　A Visit with Stakhanov

　　In the Soviet Union, there is no one who has not heard the name "Stakhanov," and similarly, the name "Stakhanov" is well-known abroad. He is the person who initiated the Stakhanovite movement thirteen years ago, a movement to increase labor productivity that has now swept the nation. He once set an astounding industrial record by exceeding the ordinary production quota by more than fourteen times, and today his disciples can be found in any factory, manufacturing plant, and mining area in the Soviet Union. There are probably very few people who are not interested in understanding the current work of this Donbas miner.

　　I visited him not long ago for just that reason.

　　Stakhanov, who graduated from the Industrial Academy before the war with a diploma qualifying him as an engineer, is now the director of a department in the Soviet Eastern Coal Industry Ministry, responsible for spreading the Stakhanovite work method among miners.

　　He only began attending night school in the Soviet era. Because he was the son of a poor farmer, he was unable to complete even elementary school in Tsarist Russia. Simultaneously working and studying was certainly not an easy task, but he had a strong determination and an indomitable spirit. He was accustomed to hard work, and eventually received both secondary and higher education.

　　When I visited him at the Ministry of Industry, the first thing that struck me was that although time had left its mark on his face, he was still as strong and vigorous as before, with an endearing demeanor and a warm smile playing around his lips. Dressed in the uniform of a mine supervisor, tall and strongly built, he didn't look like a man of forty-three. Only his two strong, large hands testified to what he used to do.

　　Stakhanov led me to a map and explained the distribution of the mines under the jurisdiction of his ministry—the Urals, the famous Karaganda coalfield in the Kazakh Republic, Siberia, Central Asia, and the Far East. He said that before the revolution, these regions accounted for only 12 percent of Russia's total coal production, but by 1940, before the war, their output had increased to twice the total output of all the mines in old Russia.

　　Stakhanov pointed out: "This is the result of Stalin's farsighted and wise policies. These mines, like the metallurgical plants in the east, were started under Stalin's initiative. If we had not developed industry there, it is not difficult to imagine what kind of disaster would have befallen us during the war. The Donbas coalfield was seized by the German invaders, and therefore we lost our largest fuel supply in the western part of our country. So, if we had not opened up the coalfields in the east, we would have suffered a disaster."

　　"More specifically, what is your current work?"

　　"My colleagues and I are now working hard to introduce to various industrial enterprises the valuable innovations proposed by miners, engineers, and technicians. Currently, there are more than 12,000 workers working in our coal mines, who systematically complete two or more times the standard production quota every day. About 1,000 of them have achieved the five-year target, and 65 have been awarded the title of Hero of Socialist Labor for their outstanding achievements. As you know, we have a large number of workers who know their jobs very well, so we all consider them to be experts in this field."

　　"Does that mean they are all Stakhanovites?"

　　"Yes, they are all called Stakhanovites."

　　He continued: "It is impossible for a single agency to study all the achievements of hundreds of workers' rationalization proposers separately, even if it has hundreds of staff members working on it. Therefore, technical experience is mainly transferred within the organization of mines and coal corporations. The most valuable contributions in this area are popularized by publications, especially by newspapers published by coal mines. There are also many technical writings describing all the significant mining innovations. When miners' rationalization proposals are proven to be very beneficial, they are sent to various coal mines to give lectures, explaining their new methods of work. In short, we try as much as possible to make the most modern mining methods known not only to the workers in our Eastern Industry Department, but also to the workers in the Western Industry Department."

　　"Do miners get patents when they invent something?"

　　Stakhanov replied: "Innovations proposed by miners are divided into two types. The first includes new methods of organizing labor, which, although we consider them to be very important and necessary conditions for the development of industry, cannot be classified as inventions. The second type is technical proposals, which are rewarded and incentivized with bonuses, government medals, and wage increases, because if miners can increase their coal production, then their income will naturally increase. Each mine has a committee dedicated to studying all new inventions and helping workers apply them. Miners receive certificates of authorship from the 'State Committee for the Introduction of New Technologies in the National Economy.' The second type of inventions are also passed on to workers through our superiors, and we do our best to put the inventions into large-scale practical use."

　　I know that Stakhanov himself has made several inventions in recent years. For the past two years, he and three other inventors have been working together to introduce improvements in mining methods, especially shaft sinking methods. Because the new Five-Year Plan stipulates the development of large mines, shaft sinking is an important task. I also learned from his words that they are currently studying an interesting problem in order to increase the productivity of underground support beams.

　　Stakhanov pointed out that technical work in mines has completely replaced manual labor with machines. More than 98 percent of coal breaking work in Eastern mines has been mechanized, and more than 90 percent of hauling work has been mechanized. This is due to the adoption of a greater number of coal mining machines and other various more powerful and latest machines.

　　Stakhanov continued: "As for the method of sinking shafts, if our ideal is realized, there will be no need to use drilling machines to drill holes, nor will there be any need to use explosives to blast. That is, both drilling and blasting methods can be eliminated from this stage of mining work. We hope to design a machine that can operate on completely different principles and work faster. In the future, this machine can almost simultaneously sink shafts and apply steel bone cement to the shaft walls."

　　When talking about the fact that technical training institutions are freely available for all miners to use at will, Stakhanov pointed out that due to this, hundreds of miners have become famous people in the technical field. He said that these miners' proposals "have in fact become earth-shattering miracles." The day is not far off when the mechanization of Soviet mines will reach the point where the main tasks of mining work are undertaken by machines.

　　Stakhanov took out a batch of letters and handed them to me to read, all of which he had recently received. People from all over the world wrote to him. In the most recently sent group, there was a letter from a French miner. He wrote:

　　"If we increase labor productivity, then we will make the employers rich and increase the number of unemployed. When I heard that you already had a large number of followers, I said to myself: Let the reactionaries spread rumors as they please, your example can best refute them, so I think that if increasing labor productivity would make your own situation worse, then millions of ordinary people would not strive to increase it."

　　When I said goodbye to Stakhanov, I asked how his family was doing. In response, he showed me a photo. The photo showed him and his wife, four children—a son and three daughters.

　　I asked him: "Are you going to let your son be a miner too?"

　　He replied: "I have been thinking about it for twenty-five years, but I still haven't decided. Why shouldn't he work in the coal mine? Everything there is mechanized, it is very safe, and the wages are high, and miners are very respected. However, it is still a bit early to think about this. So, when he grows up, let him choose for himself."

　　斯达汉诺夫访问记
    在苏联没有一个人没有听说过“斯达汉诺夫”这个名字的，这样在外国“斯达汉诺夫”的名字也是尽人皆晓的。他就是十三年前发起提高劳动生产率运动、现已风行于全国之斯达汉诺夫运动的人。他曾经用超过普通的生产份量十四倍以上的惊人成绩立下了工业纪录，并且现今在苏联任何工厂、制造厂及矿区里都可以找到他的门徒，对于了解这个顿巴斯矿工现在的工作不感觉兴趣的人恐怕也很少。
    不久前我去拜访他也就是为了这个。
    战前毕业于工业学院时获得有资格充当工程师之文凭的斯达汉诺夫，他现任苏联东区煤炭工业部某司司长，负责在矿工之间传布斯达汉诺夫工作方法。
    他在苏维埃年代里才开始入夜校学习。因为他是一个贫苦农民的儿子，所以在沙俄时代甚至于连小学都没能上完。同时工作、同时学习，当然这不是一件容易的事情，可是他有坚强的决心、不屈不挠的精神，他惯于艰苦的工作，所以终究受到了中学教育和高等教育。
    我到工业部去拜访他的时候，头一个使我注目的就是，虽然光阴在他的脸上已经打下了不年青的烙印，可是，他仍旧和从前一样，强而有力，姿态令人可爱，嘴边漂浮着亲热的微笑。身披矿井监督的制服，高个儿，强健的体格，不象四十三岁的样子，只有他那两只强而有力的大手证明他从前是干什么的。
    斯达汉诺夫把我领到一张地图的跟前，给我说明归他的工业部所管辖的矿井分布状况——乌拉尔、卡查赫共和国著名的卡拉冈达煤田、西比利亚、中亚西亚以及远东。他说，革命前，这些地区占俄国煤炭的总产量不过百分之十二，然而战前的一九四○年，它们的产量已增至旧俄国全部矿井总产量的两倍。
    斯达汉诺夫指出：“这就是斯大林眼光远大的、贤明的政策的结果。这些矿井，也和东部的冶金工厂一样，都是在斯大林的发起之下开工的。假定我们在那里未曾发展工业，那么，战争期间能有什么样的灾祸降到我们的头上来，这是不难想象的。顿巴斯煤田被德寇抢去了，因此我们在我国西部便失掉最大的燃料供应。所以说，如果我们没有开辟东区的煤田，我们一定受到了灾难”。
    “再具体点说，现在的工作是什么？”
    “我和同事现在努力介绍由矿工、工程师及技师们提议的各种宝贵的革新法给各工业企业。现时在我们煤坑里工作的工人共有一万二千多人，他们有系统地每天完成两倍或者更多的标准生产份量。其中约一千人已达到五年的目标，六十五个人因有显著成就而得到社会主义劳动英雄的称号。正和你所知道的一样，我们拥有一大批工人，他们都很好地知道自己的工作，所以我们都认为他们就是这一部门的专家”。
    “这就是说，他们都是斯达汉诺夫吗？”
    “不错，他们都被称为斯达汉诺夫”。
    他继续说：“单独一个机关是不可能把数百工人合理化提议者的全部成就分开来研究的，假定它有数百职员从事工作也是不可能的。因此，主要在矿井及煤炭联合公司的组织之内传递技术经验。这一部门最宝贵的投稿，由刊物，特别是由煤矿出版的报纸普及。也有许多技术方面的著作，描写一切显著的矿业革新法。矿工的合理化提议能够被证实非常有利益的时候，他们就被派到各煤矿去演讲，说明自己的工作新方法。总而言之，我们尽可能把最新式的采煤方法不仅使我们东区工业部的工人知道，也使西区工业部的工人们知道”。
    “矿工们发明了东西的时候，得不得特许权呢？”
    斯达汉诺夫答道：“由矿工提议的革新法分为两种。第一种包括组织劳动的新方法，虽然我们认为这些也是发展工业之十分重要的必需条件，但是，它们并不能被归类于发明之内。第二种就是技术提案，这由于奖金、政府的勋章及提高工资来酬报与奖励，因为如果矿工能增加自己的煤炭产量，那么，他的收入自然也要增加。每个矿井都有一个委员会，专门研究一切新发明，并帮助工人应用新发明。矿工们由‘介绍国民经济新技术之国家委员会’领得著作证书。第二种发明也都通过我们的上级再传递给工人，我们尽全力使发明大规模实用”。
    我知道，斯达汉诺夫本身近几年来也有了几种发明。到现在已经两年了，他和另外三位发明家共同研究，为的是介绍采矿法，特别是竖坑开凿法之改善。因为就新五年计划规定发展大矿井之计划而论，开凿竖坑乃是一门重要的工作。我又从他的话中听出，他们几个人现正研究一个有趣味的问题，为的是提高地下作梁的生产率。
    斯达汉诺夫指出，矿井的技术工作已将手工劳动完全换上了机器。东区矿井的碎煤工作百分之九十八以上业已机械化，搬进工作百分之九十以上业已机械化。这是因为采用了更大多数的采煤机以及其它各种更强大的最新式机器。
    斯达汉诺夫继称：“至于开凿竖坑之方法，如果我们的理想实现，就不需要用钻孔机钻孔，也用不着用炸药爆炸，就是钻孔与爆炸两种方法都可以从采矿工作的这一阶段被废除。我们希望设计一种机器，能根据完全不同的原理开动，并且能更快地工作。将来这个机器几乎可以同时开凿竖坑，同时把钢骨水涂到坑壁上”。
    谈到技术训练机关免费供全部矿工任意享用时，斯达汉诺夫指出，由于这点，数百矿工都已成为技术部门著名的人了。他说，这些矿工的提议“事实上都已成为惊天动地的奇事”了。苏联矿井机械化达到采矿工作的主要任务由其机器者担负的程度，这样的日子已经不远。
    斯达汉诺夫拿出一批信交给我看，都是他新近接到的。全世界各地都给他写信。在最新近寄来的一组里。有一封是一位法国矿工寄来的。他写道：
    “如果我们把劳动生产率提高，那么就要使雇主发财，并且还要增加大批失业者。听说您已经有了一大批追随者的时候，我自言自语地说：让反动分子们随便造谣罢，您的榜样能够最好地反驳他们，因此我跷得，假定把劳动生产率提高反而使自己的状况更坏的话，那么，就不会有数百万普通的人民努力去提高它的”。
    我同斯达汉诺夫告别的时候，问他的家属如何。他作为答复，拿用一张像片给我看。像片上有他自己和他的夫人，四个孩子——一个儿子，三个女儿。
    我问他：“你是否也要让你的儿子当矿工呢？”
    他答道：“二十五年前我就想过，但是老是没有决定。你说，为什么不准在煤坑里工作呢？那里的一切东西都已机械化，很安全，并且工资很高，矿工又非常受尊敬。不过，想这个，还多少有些早。所以等他长大以后，让他自己选罢”。
