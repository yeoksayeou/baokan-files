Xinhua News Agency, Tianjin, 9th. The Tianjin People's Municipal Government has properly handled nearly tens of thousands of dispersed soldiers and stragglers from the Kuomintang bandit army who were stranded in Tianjin, bringing social order back on track rapidly. This has greatly contributed to the maintenance of public security and the stability of citizens' lives. Before the liberation of Tianjin, nearly 20,000 Kuomintang bandit soldiers, stragglers, wounded, and prisoners of war who had fled from Northeast China and other places wandered the streets of Tianjin. At that time, with the connivance of the Kuomintang reactionary authorities, they extorted and robbed everywhere, forcibly occupied civilian houses, causing many restaurants, bathhouses, hotels, shops, etc., to be forced to close down, and the citizens were miserable. After liberation, the People's Municipal Government immediately established a Kuomintang Army Stragglers, Wounded and Prisoners of War Handling Office, and set up temporary shelters in various districts, responsible for rapid reception and handling. It has now taken in 18,602 Kuomintang army stragglers, wounded and prisoners of war, and 234 family members, and properly handled them separately. It was decided that 11,699 people would be sent to the old liberated areas for training, 1,985 seriously injured would be sent to hospitals for treatment, 4,322 would be issued passes and travel expenses to be sent back to their original places, and 176 died due to ineffective treatment of serious injuries. The rest are all wounded soldiers, who will be transported to hospitals for treatment within a few days. This work began on the 16th of last month and ended on the 30th, lasting only fifteen days. The citizens praised it, and a merchant said: "The Communist Party has a way of doing things, it's really quick. If it weren't for liberation, no family would have a peaceful year with this group of wounded, prisoners and stragglers."

　　津市人民市政府
  　妥善处理敌散兵游勇
    【新华社天津九日电】天津市人民民主政府对流落津市之国民党匪军数近几万的散兵游勇，已予妥善处理，使社会秩序迅速地纳入轨道，这对公共治安的维持和市民生活的安定贡献很大。津市解放前，由东北等地溃逃下来流落在津市街头的国民党匪军散兵伤俘，为数近两万人，当时他们在国民党反动当局纵容下，到处敲诈抢劫、强占民房，闹得许多饭馆、澡塘、旅馆、商铺等被迫停业，市民无不叫苦连天。解放后，人民市政府立即设立国民党军散兵伤俘处理处，并在各区分设临时收容所，负责迅速收容处理，现已收容了国民党军散兵伤俘一万八千六百零二名及其眷属二百三十四名，并分别予以妥善处理，决定送老解放区受训者一万一千六百九十九人，重伤送入医院医治者一千九百八十五人，发给通行证及路费遣回原籍者四千三百二十二人，因重伤医治无效而死亡者一百七十六人。其余均为伤兵，日内即可运入医院医治。这一工作，开始于上月十六日，至三十日即告一段落，为时仅十五天。市民莫不称颂，有一个商民说：“共产党办事有办法，真麻利（快）。要不是解放了，就凭这伙子伤俘散兵，谁家也过不了平安年。”
