    Taihang Fifth Prefectural Committee Calls on Cadres to Intensify Leadership of the Masses in Self-Relief
    [This Newspaper's Report] At the beginning of this month, the Taihang Fifth Prefectural Committee instructed all counties to strengthen production and disaster relief work. It pointed out that last year, the widespread occurrence of waterlogging, drought, locusts, and hail in various counties led to reduced autumn harvests. The counties along the borders, especially Hui County, Anyang, Zhangnan, and Ye County, suffered serious famine due to the enemy's continuous burning, killing, and plundering. To date, the number of disaster victims has reached 400,000. Therefore, leading the masses in production to overcome the famine this spring has become an urgent task for the entire region. The instruction emphasized that, first of all, in the ideological thinking of cadres at all levels, they must overcome the incorrect ideas of being numb to the disaster situation, belittling it, or only blindly shouting about the disaster without specifically organizing the masses to produce and overcome the famine, or emphasizing and relying on the government to distribute grain for relief without actively organizing the masses to engage in production for self-relief and fighting the enemy. Only in this way can a mass production and famine relief campaign be effectively launched. Furthermore, the organizational leadership should be strengthened, and production and disaster relief committees should be immediately organized at all levels (the sub-districts have already been established) to specifically lead the production and famine relief work. The main responsible cadres of each county (county head and county secretary) must personally lead, designate specific personnel to be responsible, divide the work, and establish a work system at each level to effectively combine production and famine relief. Counties and districts should establish economic organizations, organize disaster victims to produce, promote the sale of products made by disaster victims, and solve various specific difficulties in the production of disaster victims. Each county can allocate 20 to 40 million yuan (Jicha banknotes) according to the severity of the disaster to support and organize cooperatives to serve the disaster victims and promote production. We should fully develop the principle of "relying on the mountains if near the mountains, and relying on the water if near the water," and the successful experience of past production and disaster relief. Starting from all aspects, and based on the local production conditions of the masses, we should organize various productions, such as handicrafts, workshops, sideline occupations, transportation, and work-for-relief. We should promote the enthusiasm of farmers and form a mass movement for production and famine relief. The instruction pointed out that, in addition to the masses engaging in production for self-relief, the government must also provide a portion of grain for loans or relief when necessary, but it is necessary to strictly prevent the idea of relying on relief from higher authorities and the attitude of bestowing favors on the masses. In order to regulate the lives and means of production of disaster victims, mutual lending among farmers can be encouraged, but it must not form a "movement."

　　战胜蒋匪造成的严重灾害
  　豫北动员生产渡荒
    太行五地委号召干部加紧领导群众自救
    【本报讯】本月初太行五地委曾指示各县，加强生产救灾工作。指出去年各县水、旱、蝗、雹的普遍发生，致使秋禾减收，边沿各县特别是辉县、安阳、漳南、邺县等县，因敌人连续的烧杀掠夺，造成严重的灾荒，至今灾民已达四十万人，因之，今春领导群众生产渡荒已成为全区紧急任务。该指示强调，首先在各级干部领导思想上，必须克服对灾情麻痹、轻视或只盲目叫喊灾情，而不去具体组织群众生产渡荒、或者强调和依赖政府发粮救济，而不去积极组织群众生产自救对敌斗争等等不正确思想，才能有效的开展群众性的生产渡荒。再即应健全组织领导，立即组织各级生产渡灾委员会（分区已建立），专门领导生产渡荒工作。各县主要负责干部（县长、县书）必须亲自领导，指定专人负责，分工进行，逐级建立工作制度，有效的把生产渡荒结合起来。县、区建立经济组织，组织灾民生产，推销灾民生产品，解决灾民生产中的各种具体困难。各县可依据灾情大小，抽出二千万到四千万元（冀钞）来扶植与组织为灾民服务的合作社，推动生产：应充分发扬“靠山吃山靠水吃水”的方针，与过去生产救灾的成功经验，从各方面着手，根据当地群众生产条件，组织各种生产，如手工业、作坊、副业运输、以工代赈等。发扬农民积极性，形成群众的生产渡荒运动。指示中提出，除群众生产自救外，必要时政府还须拿出一部粮食进行借贷或救济，但要严防依靠上级救济的思想与对群众的恩赐观点。为调剂灾民的生活生产资料，可鼓励农民间的友谊的互相借贷，但绝不能形成“运动”。
