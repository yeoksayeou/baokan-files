　　Xinhua News Agency, Beiping, February 23rd: The Beiping Municipal Public Security Bureau recently uncovered six organizations involved in the manufacture and distribution of counterfeit Liberated Area bank notes. The manufacture and distribution of these counterfeit notes was planned and directed by the "Special Committee" organized by Mao Renfeng, the head of the Kuomintang secret service, the pseudo-Ministry of National Defense Security Bureau. Among them, the Changcheng Printing Bureau outside Xuanwumen in Beiping printed the counterfeit notes. This bureau has been taken over by the Military Control Commission after the case was discovered. Other discovered agencies involved in distribution and transportation were the "Special Groups" established by the aforementioned "Special Committee" on the Pingjin, Pinghan, Pingsui, and Jinpu lines, as well as a public business organization in Tianjin. Four types of counterfeit banknotes have been found: People's Bank currency of 50 yuan notes, Jin-Cha-Ji Border Region Bank currency of 5,000 yuan notes, Jin-Cha-Ji Border Region Bank currency of 5,000 yuan notes with Ji-Re-Liao characters, and North Sea Bank currency of 500 yuan notes.

　　Xinhua News Agency, Beiping, February 23rd: The people of Beiping are extremely disgusted with the bogus Gold Yuan notes. Although there are still three days before the deadline for exchange stipulated by the democratic government, the black market price of the bogus Gold Yuan has depreciated to eleven yuan in exchange for one yuan of People's currency. This black market exchange rate is already lower than the 10:1 ratio set by the People's Bank. Citizens and merchants who still have bogus Gold Yuan notes in hand are busy exchanging them at the People's Bank.

  　平公安局破获六起
    【新华社北平二十三日电】北平市公安局最近破获制造及推销解放区银行假钞票的机关六起。此种假钞的制造与推销，系由国民党特务机关伪国防部保密局长毛人凤所组织的“特别委员会”所主持策划。其中印制假钞者为北平宣武门外的长城印刷局，该局在案发后业经军管会接收。其他破获的推销贩运机关为上述“特别委员会”在平津、平汉、平绥、津浦各线所设的“特种组”分组及天津市一个公开的营业机关。已发现的伪钞有四种，即人民银行币五十元券，晋察冀边区银行币五千元券，晋察冀边区银行附有冀热辽字样的五千元券及北海银行五百元券。
    【新华社北平二十三日电】北平市人民极端厌恶伪金圆券。距离民主政府所规定的收兑截止期限虽然还有三天，但伪金圆券的黑市价格已贬值到十一元兑换人民券一元。这一黑市兑率，已低于人民银行所定十比一的比价。现手头还残留有伪金圆券的市民和商人，都正忙于向人民银行兑换。
