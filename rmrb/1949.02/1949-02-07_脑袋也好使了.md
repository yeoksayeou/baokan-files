　　My Brain Works Better Now Too
　　Zhao Haipeng
　　(Editor's note: The author, Zhao Haipeng, is an electrical worker at the Liaoyang Textile Factory's branch. He designed and installed an automatic switch for the electric gate on the spinning frame, which saved the factory a lot of electricity. This article writes that he had long desired to set up an automatic switch for the electric gate, but because he was under the oppression of the Kuomintang in the past, he never had the mind to study it. After Shenyang was liberated, his life improved, he felt happy, and "his brain worked better." He completed his creation in just seven or eight days. The following is his full text.)
　　　
　　I am an electrician at the Shenyang branch of the Liaoyang Textile Factory. Because I made an automatic switch for the electric gate in January, a reporter from the New China News Agency asked me to write about this experience. This aroused many of my feelings. I said to the reporter: "Is there a need to write about such a small thing? To be honest, I wouldn't have been able to research it if the Communist Party hadn't come. Back then, I was trying to figure out how to feed myself all day, I didn't have the energy to think about that!" The reporter said: "Just write about this idea!" Okay, I agreed.
　　When the Kuomintang was in power, I saw that the electric gate wasn't closed when the spinning frame was doffing, and the motor was still spinning. I thought, "This damages the motor and wastes electricity. But it's too much effort to close the electric gate, we should find a way to fix it."
　　It's heartbreaking to talk about it. It's not that I didn't want to study it, but when the Kuomintang was here, our workers couldn't even fill our stomachs with bran, vegetables, and bean noodles all day long. Our families were so hungry that they were just skin and bones, and only our eyeballs were fat. Who had the mind to study? So at that time, I just thought about it and let it go. A few times, I almost figured it out in the factory, but when I went home, my wife would greet me at the door with her hand outstretched, asking for food to cook. Where did I have any food? I was worried, and so was she. We'd argue a few times, have a fight, and then I wouldn't have any energy to think about anything anymore. When I returned to the factory and saw the imposing officials looking down on us workers like we were less than dogs, I was even more furious. I thought, "Study, study my ass! A monthly wage of sixty catties of sorghum, I'd take it home and count it all up. Study! Whoever studies that stuff is a fool!"
　　The situation after the Communist Party came is truly a world of difference from before! The Kuomintang treated workers like soybean cakes to be squeezed for oil, squeezing them thinner and thinner, until they were squeezed to death and disbanded. The Communist Party not only values and respects workers, but also tries every means to help workers live a good life! Great! Once the Communist Party arrived at the factory, the workers straightened their backs. The Communist Party established clubs for workers, set up cooperatives, provided labor insurance, asked workers to put up wall newspapers, perform the Yangko dance, and even consulted with workers on matters big and small. I really didn't expect this. Not to mention anything else, just talking about life: after the Communist Party came, I didn't eat a single meal of soybean cake. At worst, it was sorghum rice. When I was happy, I'd eat a meal of rice and white flour. Don't you think I was happy! Once I was happy, my brain worked better and my mood changed. A dozen days ago, I thought again about how the electric gate wasn't opened when the spinning frame was doffing, which wasted both the motor and electricity. I thought I must find a way to fix this problem now. If I do it well, it will not only benefit production, but also help my own progress. Aren't the comrades saying very clearly that the factory is our own now? This is the truth, otherwise, would the factory treat us like that! The more I thought about it, the more energy I had, and the more energy I had, the more ideas I had. In less than a week or two, I figured out a way.
　　After figuring out the method, I found my workmate Wang Zhizheng, as well as Gao Guoxun and Chen Shouwen from the repair department. When I discussed it with them, they all said, "It's good! It's good! It's guaranteed to work!" So they got to work with a clang and a bang. On January 15th, they made an automatic switch for the electric gate. I installed it on a machine that hadn't been fully repaired to test it, and it worked perfectly! Everything met my expectations.
　　The process of manufacturing this switch is that simple. Although this doesn't count as an invention, this small matter shows the two kinds of living conditions, two kinds of working conditions, and two kinds of psychological conditions of our working class in two different societies. Writing this, I also remembered a bitter story: four months ago, when the Kuomintang was here, my wife gave birth to a child, and I couldn't even afford an egg. My wife was so hungry that she couldn't even squeeze out any milk, and the child was as thin as a sick dog. What about now! The child is covered in meat, as fat as a meatball. Every time I go home and hold the child in my arms, I remember the benefits the Communist Party has given me. Therefore, I will work even harder in the future.

　　脑袋也好使了
    赵海鹏
    （编者按：作者赵海鹏，是辽阳纺织厂分厂电气工人。他设计装置了细纱机上的电门自动开闭器，使工厂节省了很多电力。这篇文章中写出：他早有设置电门自动开闭器的心愿，但因过去处于国民党压榨之下，始终没有心思去研究。沈阳一解放，他的生活改善了，心里高兴了，“脑袋也好使了”，只有七八天工夫就完成了他的创造。下面是他的全文。）
    　　　
    我是辽阳纺织厂沈阳分厂的电工。因为我在一月间做了一个电门自动开闭器，新华社记者就要我把这一段经过写出来。这一下可引起了我的许多感想。我对记者说：“这点小事还用写？老实说，共产党不来我也研究不出了。那时天天为肚子想办法还想不了，还有功夫想那个事！”记者说：“你就把这个意思写一写吧！”好，我就答应了。
    原来国民党在时，我就看到细纱机在落纱时电门不闭，马达还是直转的情形。我想：“这样既伤马达又费电，可是要去关电门，又特别费劲，应当想个办法治一治。”
    说起来真寒心。自己不是不想研究，可是那时国民党在这里，咱工人一天到晚糠菜豆面都喂不饱肚子，家里老小饿的三条筋挑着个头，全身只有眼珠子是胖的，谁还有心去研究？所以当时只是一想就过去了。有几次在工厂里想的差不多了，可是回家去碰上老婆迎门张着手要粮做饭。我那有粮？我也愁，她也愁。两人顶几句，打一架，又什么心思也没有了。回到厂子再看看威风凛凛的大官把咱工人看得连条狗还不如，就更气透了。我想：“研究，研究个熊！一月六十斤高粱米的工资，拿家去数也数完了。研究！谁研究那玩艺才是傻瓜蛋呢！”
    共产党来了，情形和从前真是天地之差！国民党拿工人当豆饼榨油，越榨越瘦，早晚榨死散伙。共产党对工人不但看的重，看的起，还千方百计地设法要工人过好日子！好啊！共产党一到了工厂里，工人挺腰了。共产党给工人成立俱乐部，办合作社，弄劳动保险，要工人出墙报，扭秧歌，大小事还要和工人商量商量。这个我真是没想到。不说别的，单说生活吧：共产党来了，我就没吃一顿豆饼，顶坏也是高粱米。高兴了大米白面也吃一顿。老婆孩子都吃的肚子挺饱。你说我还不高兴么！一高兴脑袋也好使了，心情也变了。十几天以前，我又想起了细纱机在落纱时不开电门既费马达又费电的事。我想现在一定要想出办法治治这个毛病。弄好了不但对生产有好处，对自己的进步也有帮助。同志们不是说的很清楚吗，现下工厂就是咱自己的。这是实在话，不然工厂还对咱那样啊！我越想越有劲，越有劲越有办法，没有七八天我就寻思出办法来了。
    把办法寻思出来以后，我就找到了和我一道干活的工友王治政，还有修理部的高国勋、陈守文。和他们一商量、他们都说：“行！行！保险行！”于是他们就叮当叮当地干起来了。一月十五号当天就做好一个电门自动开闭器。我把它按到一架没有全部修好的机器上一试，正好！什么都合乎理想。
    制造这个开闭器的经过，就是这样简单的。这虽然算不了什么发明，但是这件小事，却表现了我们工人阶级在两种社会里的两种生活状况，两种工作状况，两种心理状况。写到这里，我又想起了一段苦情：前四个月国民党在这里，我老婆生小孩，我连个鸡蛋都买不起，老婆饿的连奶都挤不出，孩子瘦的象病狗一样。你说现在呢！孩子满身是肉，胖的象个肉撙子一样。我每逢回家把孩子往手上一抱，就想起了共产党对我的好处。因此我今后还要更加油地工作。
