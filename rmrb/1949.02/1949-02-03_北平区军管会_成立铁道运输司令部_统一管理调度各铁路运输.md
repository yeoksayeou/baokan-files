Xinhua News Agency, Pingjiao, January 31st: The Railway Transportation Headquarters of the Beiping Military Control Commission of the Chinese People's Liberation Army was established in Fengtai on the 22nd of this month. Liu Jianzhang, Deputy Minister of the Department of Transportation of the North China People's Government, concurrently serves as Commander, and Li Kefei concurrently serves as Chief of Staff. The Headquarters of the People's Liberation Army on the Pingjin Front has also sent a representative to reside in the Railway Transportation Headquarters to work together. All railways on the Pinghan, Pingjin, Pingsui, Pinggu (Beiping to Gubeikou), and Pingmen (Beiping to Mentougou) lines will henceforth be uniformly managed and dispatched by the Railway Transportation Headquarters. The nearly 20,000 employees serving on the aforementioned railway lines will also be uniformly managed by the headquarters. The phenomenon of inflexible vehicle dispatching, which was caused by the segmented takeover of various railways in the past, has been quickly overcome. Currently, the railways around Beiping that have been opened to traffic include the Fengtai to Zhuoxian section of the Pinghan Railway, the Fengtai to Tianjin section of the Beining Railway, the Yongjiabao Station west of Zhangjiakou to Qinghuayuan section of the Pingsui Railway, and the Shijingshan to Mentougou section, totaling 443 kilometers.

Xinhua News Agency, Pingjiao, February 1st: The Preparatory Committee of the Changxindian District Workers' Union of the Pinghan Railway was established on the 23rd of last month. Veteran workers who participated in the "February 7th" Revolution, such as Mei Baosong, Mei Shunqi, and Shang Zi'an, serve as members of the preparatory committee. The preparatory committee is leading more than 4,700 railway workers in the Changxindian District to actively prepare for the establishment of a formal trade union. Changxindian is one of the important birthplaces of the workers' movement in North China. In 1922, the workers, under the slogans of "Down with Imperialism" and "Down with the Warlords," launched the "February 7th" struggle against the Northern Warlords, which shocked the whole country. Furthermore, the Preparatory Committee of the Railway Workers' Union at Fengtai Station, the intersection of the Pinghan and Pingjin Railways, was also established on the 22nd.

    【新华社平郊三十一日电】中国人民解放军北平区军事管制委员会铁道运输司令部，已于本月二十二日在丰台成立，由华北人民政府交通部副部长刘建章兼任司令员，李克非兼任参谋长。平津前线人民解放军司令部并派代表一人，驻在铁道运输司令部，会同办公。所有平汉、平津、平绥、平古（北平至古北口）、平门（北平至门头沟）各线铁路，今后由铁道运输司令部统一管理和调度。在上述各线铁路中服务的近两万名员工，亦由该部统一管理。过去各铁路因分段接管，致车辆调度不灵的现象，已被迅速克服。现北平四周围的铁路已通车者，计有平汉路丰台至涿县段，北宁路丰台至天津段，平绥路张家口以西的永嘉堡站至清华园段，以及石景山至门头沟段，共长四百四十三公里。
    【新华社平郊一日电】平汉路长辛店区职工会筹委会，已于上月二十三日成立。参加“二七”革命的老工人梅宝松、梅顺起、尚子安等任筹备委员。筹委会正领导着长辛店区四千七百余名铁路职工，积极筹组正式职工会。长辛店为华北工人运动重要发祥地之一，一九二二年工人们以“打倒帝国主义”“打倒军阀”为口号，曾和北洋军阀展开震动全国的“二七”斗争。又平汉、平津铁路交叉点——丰台车站的铁路职工会筹委会，亦于二十二日成立。
