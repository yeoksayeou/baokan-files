Xinhua News Agency, Beiping, 13th. The People's Liberation Army's Beiping Garrison troops earnestly abide by city policies and discipline, and have received extensive praise from the people of Beiping. When the Eighth Platoon of the Second Company of a certain unit first entered the city and was performing mobile guard duty in the Wenjin Street area, they walked near a beautiful building. An old man told them that it was the Beiping Library. Although they had not received prior orders, they automatically bivouacked outside the gate to guard it, and no one went inside, guarding it until dawn. Zhang Guicheng, a communications soldier from the Fourth Company of a certain unit residing in Zhantan Temple, found a gold-nibbed pen in the toilet and immediately handed it over to the instructor. Soon, the owner of the pen—a second lieutenant platoon leader from Fu Zuoyi's troops—came to claim it. This news immediately spread throughout the remaining Fu Zuoyi troops stationed there. Tang, the section chief of the Ordnance Section of the Fu army, came specifically to express his admiration to the PLA battalion commander and wanted to give him his pistol "as a souvenir." The battalion commander declined. This section chief also wanted to vacate a house for the PLA and prepare tea and meals, but the battalion commander politely declined. The Tang section chief whispered, "You are afraid of violating discipline; I will secretly send it over." The battalion commander sincerely told him, "Our observance of discipline is conscious; it is the same in front of people and behind their backs." The soldiers slept there without beds, but their interior arrangements were very neat and clean. They happily ate hard corn cakes and drank cold boiled water, refusing the noodle soup sent by the Fu troops. The Tang section chief said strangely, "You live such a hard life, but you fight so fiercely?" Another unit of the PLA also lived in Zhantan Temple. When the Kuomintang army withdrew from here, they took away the light bulbs, cut the wires, moved out the furniture, and carried away the pots… everywhere was a mess, very dirty. After the PLA soldiers stayed for one night, they cleaned the room thoroughly, and even the toilets were cleaned. A squad of Kuomintang soldiers still lived there. The squad leader, after seeing this situation, sighed and said, "I was deceived by the Kuomintang before, but this time I have personally seen the actions of the PLA!" Because the current location of the First Platoon of the Fourth Company of a certain unit was inconvenient, they camped near a drugstore. The owner of the drugstore invited them in, but they declined; they also declined the millet porridge that was sent over. At eleven o'clock in the evening, the owner invited everyone into the house for the second time, but they still declined. At three o'clock in the morning, the owner came for the third time, saying, "You serve the people, you must have a healthy body. Now there is frost, and you will freeze!" The soldiers said with emotion, "Thank you, we are young and strong, it doesn't matter." The Second Platoon of the First Company of a certain unit was on guard duty at a cinema. The employees of the cinema invited the soldiers to go in and watch a movie. The soldiers explained to him kindly, "We are here to perform guard duty, not to watch movies. Thank you for your kindness." The Third Company of the Artillery Battalion of a certain unit did not have troughs for feeding the horses, so they used their own raincoats to make troughs and did not use the villagers' mats. When tying the horses, they were afraid that the horses would gnaw the bark, so they first wrapped the trees with their own raincoats and blankets. Many, many stories were quickly spread everywhere by the people of Beiping. In the streets and alleys, people often heard saying, "How can there be such a good army in the world?" Or they would say, "This is truly the army led by Chairman Mao, our people's army!"

　　我卫戍部队纪律严明
  　北平人民交口赞誉
    【新华社北平十三日电】人民解放军北平卫戍部队认真遵行城市政策和纪律，受到了北平人民的交口赞誉。某部二连八班初入城时在文津街一带担任流动警戒，走到一所漂亮的楼房附近，一个老乡告诉他们这就是北平图书馆。虽然他们事先没有得到命令，却自动在门外露宿守护，谁也不到里面去，一直守到天明。住在旃坛寺的某部四连通讯员张贵成，在厕所拾到一支金尖钢笔，随即交给指导员。不久，钢笔的主人——傅作义部一个少尉排长认领去了。这消息立即传遍还留住在那儿的傅作义部，傅军军械科唐科长特来向解放军营长表示敬佩之意，并想把自己的手枪送给他“以留纪念”，营长谢绝了。这个科长又要给解放军腾房子，又要准备茶饭，也被营长婉词辞却。那个姓唐的科长低声说：“你们怕犯纪律，我偷偷地送来好了。”营长诚恳地告诉他说：“我们遵守纪律是自觉的，人前人后都一样。”战士们在那里睡觉没有床，但是内务整理得很整齐很干净，愉快地吃着硬玉茭饼子，喝着冷开水，不接受傅部送来的面汤。那个唐科长很奇怪地说：“你们生活这样艰苦，打仗却那样厉害？”解放军另部也住在旃坛寺，国民党军在这里撤走时，拿走了灯泡，剪断了电线，搬空了家具，担走了锅子，……各处都是乱七八糟，非常肮脏。解放军的战士住了一夜，把室内整理得干干净净，厕所都打扫清净了。那里还住着国民党军一个班，班长看了这种情况，叹息着说：“以前我受了国民党的欺骗，这次算是亲眼看到解放军的行为了！”某部四连一排因当时驻地不便，在一个药铺附近露营，药铺的主人请他们进去被谢绝了；送来小米稀饭也被谢绝了；到了晚上十一点钟，主人二次请大家进屋里去还是被谢绝了。清晨三点钟，主人三次来请，他说：“你们为人民服务，必须要有个健康的身体，现在已下了霜，你们要冻坏了！”战士们感动地说：“谢谢您，我们年轻力壮不要紧的。”某部一连二排在电影院担任警戒，该院员工请战士们进去看电影，战士们和悦地向他解释说：“我们是来担任警戒的，不是来看电影的，谢谢您的好意。”某部炮兵营三连，喂马没有马槽，就用自己的雨布作成马槽，不用老乡的席子。拴马时怕马啃了树皮，先用自己的雨布和毯子把树包起。许许多多的故事，迅速地被北平人民到处传颂着。大街小巷里常听得有人说：“天下怎么会有这样好的队伍的？”或者就说：“这真是毛主席领导的队伍，咱们人民的队伍！”
