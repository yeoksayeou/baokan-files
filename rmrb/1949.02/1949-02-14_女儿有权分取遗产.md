　　Daughters Have the Right to Inherit Property
　　To the Editors:
　　I am from Shijiazhuang City, nineteen years old this year, and only married after liberation last year. My husband works in a factory in Shijiazhuang City, and has two young daughters left by his deceased former wife. We have no property and life is very difficult. My father passed away this August, leaving more than sixty rooms of houses and two young brothers and one younger sister. My mother is now repeatedly giving the family's movable property (cash, clothing, rice, and flour) to my uncle (my uncle's family is a family that has been struggled against, with two adult and young women who do not engage in proper work and rely entirely on asking my mother for things to live on). If this continues, the family property will gradually be transferred to my uncle, which will cause problems for the education of my young brothers and the life of my mother. Therefore, I propose the right of women to inherit property, and take out my share to organize production. If my mother spends her share, I am willing to use my inherited share to be responsible for supporting and educating my young brothers. Is this possible? Please advise.

　　Answer: Before the system of private property is abolished today, men and women have the same right of inheritance. According to your letter, it is wrong for your mother to take the family property and give it to your uncle to waste on improper living. For the sake of your mother and young brothers' future life, it is right for you to take a share of the property. You can ask your relatives and friends and the Shijiazhuang Municipal Government to mediate and handle it.

### 女儿有权分取遗产

专栏：询问与答复

　　女儿有权分取遗产编辑同志：
    我是石家庄市人，今年十九岁，于去年解放后才结婚，我男人现在石市工厂里工作，家中前妻遗下小女二名。没有房产，生活甚为困难。我娘家父亲于今年八月病故，家有房子六十余间，遗有幼弟二名，小妹一个。我母亲现将家中浮财（现款、衣物、米面）屡次给我舅父（我舅父家是被斗争户，有大小女人两个，不务正业，全凭向我母亲要东西度日）。如长此下去，家业将逐渐转到我舅手中，对我幼弟教育及我母亲生活均成问题。因此我提出女子继承权，将我之一份分出，让我组织生产。如我母亲将她的一份消耗完后，我愿将我分得这份遗产，对他负责扶养，教养幼弟。是否可以？请求指示。

    答：在今天私有财产制还未废除以前，男女同样有继承权。据来信说，你母亲把家中财产拿去，给你舅父浪费在不正当的生活上，这是不对的。你为了你母亲和幼弟将来的生活着想，分一份财产，是应该的。你可请你的亲戚朋友及石市政府调解处理之。
