[Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 21st] TASS announced on the 16th the “Letter from the Korean People to Marshal Stalin” signed by sixteen million people. The following are excerpts: Dear Joseph Vissarionovich:
Under your leadership, the Soviet army has liberated us from the long Japanese yoke and helped us embark on a broad, bright, free, and joyful life. The Korean people express their sincere gratitude to you—the liberator and friend of the Korean people.
For forty years, the Korean people have not seen the light of day. Darkness shrouded the country. It seemed as if the darkness would never end. The best sons and daughters of the motherland sacrificed themselves under the swords and guns of the Japanese invaders, grew old and haggard in prisons, and died under horrific torture. However, the remaining people resolutely fought for freedom and the independence of the motherland. In all kinds of suffering, our people did not lose hope for freedom, for liberation from Japanese enslavement. We looked forward in thought and feeling to the great Soviet Union, to you, dear Joseph Vissarionovich—the friend and mentor of working people all over the world. We had such confidence that bright and joyful days would come to us. This day came, and that was August 15, 1945—the great day of liberation.
With the kind assistance of the great Soviet people, the people of North Korea have restored the national economy that had been ravaged by the Japanese, implemented democratic reforms, and, at the same time, satisfied the most ardent wishes of the people of Korea and smoothly established a new life. Restored factories are emitting smoke, mines are being mined, and trains are running on the tracks. Farmers, liberated from the shackles of the Japanese and landlords, are now filling barns with rich harvests. The work of restoring and developing the industry of North Korea is proceeding at an extraordinary rate. If we take the industrial output at the beginning of 1946 as 100, then the industrial output at the beginning of 1947 was 154, at the beginning of 1948 it was 314, and in the middle of 1948 it was 441.
Due to the implementation of the democratic land reform, 720,611 tenant farmers, landless and poor peasants have obtained more than one million hectares of land. Before the land reform in North Korea, there were 17,137 tenant farmers and 442,973 landless tenant farmers. Now, they have obtained land without compensation and are living a prosperous and joyful life. In the past three years, the cultivated land in North Korea has increased by 409,000 hectares, the total grain harvest has increased by 513,600 tons, and the number of livestock has also doubled. Farmers in North Korea can now dispose of the fruits of their labor with unprecedented freedom.
The lives of women in North Korea have also completely changed. For centuries, women have been treated like livestock and despised. Now, they are equal citizens of Korea. They participate in social life and participate in the management of the country, and have demonstrated exemplary constructive labor that is beneficial to the welfare of the country.
North Korea has achieved great achievements in social education and the elimination of illiteracy. Under the regime of the Japanese aggressors, more than half of the Korean people were illiterate. North Korea had only 1,372 primary schools and 115 middle schools and technical schools, with 910,000 students. These schools could only accommodate a small portion of school-age children. However, since liberation, as of now, North Korea has 4,327 primary and middle schools, with a total of 1.74 million boys and girls in school. Moreover, 1,758 middle and primary schools and 70 correspondence schools, night middle schools, and night universities have been established for adults, with nearly one million students. In the central schools specially established to eliminate illiteracy, more than two million people are learning to read and write. Under Japanese rule, North Korea did not have a single university. Now, we have eleven universities, with approximately 10,000 students. Pyongyang National University, named after Kim Il-sung, is a university that our country can be proud of.
North Korea has transformed from a dark and impoverished country into a civilized and happy country.
In the long history of Korea, foreign troops have repeatedly invaded its territory. Only the Soviet army came to Korea as liberators, not as conquerors.
In South Korea, the people were just freed from their shackles, and immediately they were chained up again. One kind of slavery replaced another, and both were equally filthy and shameless. However, the people of South Korea, together with the people of North Korea, have established a solid foundation, prepared to unify Korea in accordance with democratic principles, and are continuing to carry out heroic struggles to win the independence of democratic Korea, against the colonial policy of the American imperialists. The uprising in October 1946 (note: From September 23 to November 11, 1946, the famous "October People's Resistance" took place, with 2 million participants), the general strike in March 1947, the uprising in February 1948 (note: the uprising was caused by opposition to the American tool "United Nations Korean Commission," the wave swept across the entire territory), and the nationwide boycott of the separatist elections in South Korea, constitute vivid examples of the South Korean people's struggle for the establishment of a unified democratic Korea. The heroic struggle wave of the South Korean people is rising unprecedentedly. In the struggle for the independence of the motherland, the democratic forces of South Korea have been tempered and strengthened. Encouraged by the achievements of democratic construction in North Korea and by the resolutions of the April meeting of representatives of political parties and public organizations in North and South Korea, the South Korean people showed the world their will to fight for the unification of a democratic Korea in the elections of the Supreme People's Assembly. 77.52 percent of South Korean voters and 99.97 percent of North Korean voters participated in the election. The achievements made by the people of North Korea in the cause of democratic construction and the heroic struggle of the people of South Korea to save the motherland guarantee the establishment of the Supreme People's Assembly and a truly democratic central government.
From now on, the national flag of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea will not only fly on the territory of North Korea, but also in many places in South Korea. No matter how enraged the American monopoly capitalists on Wall Street and their shameless lackeys may be, they will ultimately not be able to stop our victorious advance, nor hinder us from achieving our desired goal—the establishment of a single, independent, democratic Korean state. Closely united around Kim Il-sung, our people will smash all the cunning plots and tricks of domestic and foreign reactionary forces, and will resolutely and unswervingly fight to completely withdraw the troops of American imperialists from our territory.
With the kind assistance of the Soviet people and the entire democratic camp headed by the powerful Soviet Union (the bulwark of people's peace and security), we will realize the prosperity of our motherland. The friendship between our two peoples is cemented by the blood shed by Soviet soldiers on the battlefield for the liberation of Korea. The strengthening of friendship between our two peoples is our sacred task. Today, the 30 million people of Korea are looking north, towards Moscow, towards the Kremlin. For the prosperity of all progressive mankind, we sincerely wish you—Joseph Vissarionovich, a long life!

　　朝鲜人民给斯大林的信
    在你的领导下，苏军已经将我们从长久的日本枷锁下解放出来，帮助我们走上了康庄的、光明的、自由愉快生活的道路。
    　　　　　
    【新华社陕北二十一日电】塔斯社十六日发表由一千六百万人签名的“朝鲜人民给斯大林大元帅的信”，全文节略如下：亲爱的约瑟夫·维萨里奥诺维奇：
    在你的领导下，苏军已经将我们从长久的日本枷锁中解放出来，帮助我们走上了康庄的、光明的、自由愉快生活的道路。朝鲜人民特向你——朝鲜人民的解放者和朋友表示真诚的感谢。
    朝鲜人民四十年来未见天日。黑夜笼罩着全国。看来黑夜好象永无尽期。祖国最优秀的子弟在日本进犯者的刀枪下牺牲了，在监狱中衰老憔悴了，在可怖的刑讯中死去了，但是，剩下的人们仍然坚决地为自由、为祖国的独立而斗争。在种种的苦难中，我们人民并没有失去对于自由的希望，对于从日本奴役下解放出来的希望。我们在思想上和感情上都企望着伟大的苏联，企望着你、亲爱的约瑟夫·维萨里奥诺维奇——全世界劳动人民的朋友和导师。我们有这样的信心：光明的愉快的日子也会临到我们。这个日子来到了，这就是一九四五年八月十五日——伟大的解放日。
    在伟大的苏联人民亲切帮助下，北朝鲜人民已恢复了曾经受日本人摧残的国民经济，实行了民主改革，同时，满足了朝鲜全国人民最殷切的愿望，顺利地进行着新生活的建立。复原了的工厂正在冒烟，矿场正在开采，火车正在铁轨上行驶。从日本人和地主的枷锁中解放出来的农民，现正将丰富的收获物堆满谷仓。北朝鲜工业的恢复和发展工作，正在以非常的速度进行着。我们如果将一九四六年初的工业出产量算作一百，那末，一九四七年初的工业出产量为一五四，一九四八年初为三一四，一九四八年年中为四四一。
    由于实行了民主的土地改革，七二○、六一一户雇农、无地和贫苦农民，已获得一百万公顷以上的土地。北朝鲜在土地改革之前，有雇农一七、一三七户，无地的佃农四四二、九七三户。现在，他们已无代价地获得了土地，过着宽裕与愉快的生活。过去三年内，北朝鲜的耕地已增加四○九、○○○公顷，谷物总收获量已增加五一三、六○○吨，牲畜的头数也已倍增。北朝鲜农民已能空前自由地处置他们的劳动成果。
    北朝鲜的妇女生活也已完全改变。几世纪以来，妇女是被人当作牲畜看待和被人轻视的。现在，她们已是朝鲜的平等公民，她们和男子一同参加社会生活，参加管理国家，并且已表现出了有利于国家福利的堪为典范的建设的劳动。
    北朝鲜在社会教育方面和扫除文盲方面，已获得了巨大的成就。在日本侵略者的政权下，朝鲜人民曾有半数以上是文盲，北朝鲜曾只有小学一、三七二所，中学和技术学校一一五所，在学人数是九十一万。这些学校只能容纳学龄儿童中较少的一部分。但在解放以来，截至目前，北朝鲜已有小学和中学四、三二七所，在学的男女儿童共一百七十四万。而且已经为成人设立一、七五八所中学和小学以及七十所函授学校、夜间中学和夜间大学，其学生将近一百万人。在为了扫除文盲而特别设立的中心学校内，二百多万人正在学习读和写。在日本人统治下，北朝鲜没有一所大学。现在，我们有了十一所大学，在学的学生约一万人。以金日成命名的平壤国立大学，乃是我们国家可据以自豪的大学。
    北朝鲜已经从一个黑暗和贫穷的国家变成一个文明和幸福的国家了。
    在朝鲜悠久的历史中，外国军队曾屡次进犯其领土。只有苏军是作为解放者而不是作为征服者来到朝鲜的。
    在南朝鲜，人民刚刚摆脱了枷锁，立即又被人桎梏起来。一种奴役制度替代了另一种奴役制度，前后两种都是一样地龌龊与无耻。但是，南朝鲜人民已与北朝鲜人民一道，建立了稳固的基础，准备依照民主方针统一朝鲜，并正在继续不断地进行英勇斗争，以争取民主朝鲜的独立，反对美国帝国主义者的殖民政策。一九四六年十月的起义（按：从一九四六年九月二十三日至十一月十一日，发生了有名的“十月人民抗争”，参加斗争者达二百万人），一九四七年三月的总罢工、一九四八年二月的起义（按：起义起因于反对美国工具“联合国朝鲜委员会”，浪潮遍及全境），以及对南朝鲜分裂主义的选举之全国性抵制，构成了南朝鲜人民为争取成立单一的民主朝鲜而斗争的生动实例。南朝鲜人民的英勇斗争浪潮正在空前高涨。在争取祖国独立的斗争中，南朝鲜的民主力量已受到＠炼并已更加坚强。在朝鲜最高人民议会的选举中被北朝鲜民主建设的成就所鼓舞、以及被南北朝鲜各政党和各公共团体代表四月会议的决议所鼓舞的南朝鲜人民，已向全世界显出其争取民主朝鲜的统一而斗争的意志。南朝鲜选民的百分之七十七点五二以及北朝鲜选民的百分之九十九点九七都参加了选举。北朝鲜人民在民主建设事业中所获得的成就以及南朝鲜人民为拯救祖国而进行的英勇斗争，就保证了最高人民议会以及真正民主的中央政府的成立。
    从今以后，朝鲜人民民主共和国的国旗，不仅将在北朝鲜领土上飘扬，并且将在南朝鲜许多地方飘扬。不论华尔街的美国垄断资本家以及其阿谀无耻的奴才们如何地老羞成怒，他们终究不能制止我们的胜利前进，不能阻碍我们达到我们所企望的目标——单一的独立民主朝鲜国家的建立。紧密地团结在金日成周围的我们人民，将粉碎国内及国外反动势力的一切狡猾的阴谋诡计，将坚决不渝地进行斗争，使美国帝国主义者的军队完全撤出我国的领土。
    在苏联人民以及以强大国家苏联（人民的和平与安全的堡垒）为首的整个民主阵营的亲切援助下，我们将要实现我们祖国的繁荣。我们两国人民的友谊，是由为解放朝鲜而战的苏联战士在战场上所洒的鲜血所凝结的，两国人民友谊的加强，乃是我们的神圣任务。今天，我们朝鲜的三千万人民，正在翘首北望，望着莫斯科，望着克里姆林。为了全世界进步人类的欣欣向荣，我们由衷地祝贺你——约瑟夫·维萨里奥诺维奇万寿无疆！
