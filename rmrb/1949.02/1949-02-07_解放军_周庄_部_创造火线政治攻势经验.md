Xinhua News Agency, Central Plains, 3rd. The People's Liberation Army's "Zhouzhuang" unit, during the Huaihai Campaign when it was encircling and annihilating the Kuomintang bandit army Huang Wei Corps, launched a mass political offensive against the enemy, paying particular attention to using frontline loudspeaker appeals. This induced the surrender of six companies, two platoons, two squads, and more than 570 scattered personnel. The pseudo-Ministry of National Defense expressed extreme fear about this. According to the pseudo-Ministry of National Defense's "Psychological Warfare Instruction No. 3," captured by the People's Liberation Army, the PLA's "combination of loudspeaker appeals and military actions can use military actions to coordinate with loudspeaker appeals, and use loudspeaker appeals to create favorable military conditions." The main experiences summarized by this unit in carrying out frontline political offensives are:

First, a psychological war. In loudspeaker appeals, fully publicize the People's Liberation Army's lenient policy towards enemy officers and soldiers, and tell them that the People's Liberation Army will definitely win, and that surrender is their only way out. The publicity of the lenient policy breaks down enemy concerns. For example, proposing "surrender and hand over weapons, guaranteed no killing," and "no beating, no scolding, no searching of pockets" has a great effect. The publicity that the People's Liberation Army is bound to win breaks down enemy illusions. For example, proposing "Li Yannian and Liu Ruming have been defeated and retreated back to Bengbu, unable to reinforce you," and "The Qiu, Li, and Sun corps are being encircled and annihilated, and will not reinforce you." More importantly, loudspeaker appeals should be based on the enemy's own interests, life and death. For example, when encircling and annihilating the Huang Wei Corps, the biggest problem in the enemy's mind was "hunger." That is, propose: "If you don't surrender, you will starve to death," "There is food to eat on the People's Liberation Army's side," and "Life is your own, it's not worth dying for" are all extremely effective. The most effective form of propaganda against the enemy is loudspeaker appeals, because it is easiest for enemy officers and soldiers to hear, and can be said vividly and richly, and spreads quickly.

Second, in the frontline political offensive, pay attention to observing the other party's expression, judging the degree of maturity, and pay attention to identifying the enemy's surrender signs, so as not to inadvertently attack or reject their surrender. For example, when we broadcast appeals and the enemy listens quietly, it means they have the intention to surrender. The enemy's surrender signs include raising hands, holding white flags, turning cotton clothes inside out, carrying guns upside down, etc. At the same time, we must also find ways to dispel the concerns of enemy officers and soldiers who have wavered and intend to surrender.

Third, military actions and political offensives must be well combined. For example, when the Third Company of a certain regiment attacked Yangshizi, it shouted while fighting, and three companies of the enemy surrendered to us. For another example, when the Eleventh Company of a certain regiment rushed into Yangzhuang, it shouted while fighting, and the enemy surrendered one company, and the People's Liberation Army captured two bunkers. Under military attack, it is easy to cause the enemy to waver. At this time, we should seize the opportunity to carry out loudspeaker appeals to disintegrate the enemy.

Fourth, in addition to propaganda, utilizing relationships, such as using prisoners to persuade the enemy, etc., is also very effective in winning over the enemy to surrender on the battlefield. The People's Liberation Army's treatment and release of enemy wounded soldiers has a great disintegrating effect on the enemy. Battlefield loudspeaker appeals should also utilize relationships. For example, using captured officers and soldiers of the enemy's 18th Army to shout to the 18th Army, and using captured officers and soldiers of the enemy's 14th Army to shout to the 14th Army, is easier to gain trust. Newly liberated soldiers are more effective in loudspeaker appeals than old liberated soldiers, and liberated soldiers are more effective than soldiers in the liberated areas.

Fifth, immediately give the enemy officers and soldiers who have surrendered spiritual comfort and encouragement, sympathize with their pain, commend them for their meritorious service in surrendering, and make good arrangements for them in life.

　　解放军“周庄”部
  　创造火线政治攻势经验
    【新华社中原三日电】解放军“周庄”部队于淮海战役围歼国民党匪军黄维兵团时，开展群众性的对敌政治攻势，尤其注意使用火线喊话办法，争取了敌人六个连、二个排，两个班，又零星人员五百七十余人投降。伪国防部对此表示异常恐惧。据解放军缴获的伪国防部之“心理作战教令第三号”中供称：解放军“喊话与军事动作有机结合，能以军事行动配合喊话，以喊话造成军事上有利条件。”该部此次总结开展火线政治攻势的主要经验是：
    第一，攻心战。在喊话中充分宣传人民解放军对敌军官兵的宽大政策，并告诉他们解放军一定胜利，他们只有投降才是出路。宽大政策的宣传就是打破敌人顾虑，如提出“投降缴枪保险不杀”，“不打不骂不搜腰包”效果很大。解放军一定胜利的宣传是打破敌人幻想，如提出“李延年、刘汝明被击退回蚌埠去了，无法增援你们”，“邱、李、孙兵团正被围歼，更不会增援你们”。更重要的是根据敌人切身利益生死利害进行喊话。如在围歼黄维兵团时，敌人思想上最大问题是“饥饿”，即提出：“再不投降就饿死了”、“到解放军这边有饭吃”、“命是自己的，死了不值得”等皆极有效。对敌宣传形式最起作用的是喊话，因最易为敌官兵都听得到，并可说得生动丰富，传播也快。
    第二，火线政治攻势中，要注意观察对方表情，判断成熟程度，并注意识别敌人投降记号，以免在无意中打击或拒绝其投降。如我们喊话敌人静听时，即表示有投降意思。敌人投降记号则有举手、执白旗、翻穿棉衣、倒背枪等。同时还要想办法破除已经动摇企图投降的敌军官兵的顾虑。
    第三，军事动作与政治攻势要很好的结合。如某团第三连攻击杨氏子时边打边喊，敌人就有三个连向我投降。又如某团十一连突进杨庄时，一面喊话一面打，敌人投降一连，解放军夺下两个碉堡。在军事打击下，易引起敌人的动摇，这时应抓住时机进行喊话瓦解敌人。
    第四，战场上争取敌人缴械，除宣传外，利用关系，如以俘虏劝敌等，亦很有效果。解放军将敌伤兵治疗后释放，对敌瓦解作用很大。战场喊话亦应利用关系，如以敌十八军的被俘官兵去喊十八军，以敌十四军的被俘官兵去喊十四军，容易得到信任。新解放战士喊话比老解放战士易起作用，解放战士比解放区战士易起作用。
    第五，对投降过来的敌军官兵马上给以精神上的安慰鼓励、同情他们的痛苦，表扬他们投降有功，并在生活上很好的安置他们。
