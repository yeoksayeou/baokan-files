Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, February 25th. The Yoshida Cabinet, a running dog of U.S. imperialism, which was formed on the 16th, is intensifying its attack on the Japanese laboring people. According to a TASS report on the 21st citing "Asahi Shimbun," the Yoshida Cabinet has proposed measures for an anti-communist movement. Regarding the existing decree to ban political parties and organizations "whose activities are aimed at opposing the occupation," the Japanese government is planning to revise it to suppress the Communist Party. The Japanese government plans to hold a referendum on the issue of revising the constitution and will review various plans to establish an American-style "Un-Japanese Activities Committee." Reactionary elements such as former Diet member Tsunashima and former Tokyo University professor Tanabe are currently considering launching a broad anti-communist movement plan. Communist Diet members Sanzō Nosaka, Isao Nakanishi, Kazuyoshi Tsuchibashi, and Bairu Hosokawa questioned Cabinet Secretary General Masuda about this. Masuda openly admitted that the government intends to establish an "Un-Japanese Activities Committee."

According to a report from the Dentsu News Agency in Tokyo, the reactionary Japanese government, under the pretext of "saving measures," will soon lay off 30 percent of Japanese civil servants. At the same time, the lives of three million employees will be affected by this measure. A MacArthur Headquarters spokesman openly declared on the 21st that "Japan must prepare itself this year to cope with the most serious unemployment problem since the war" because "inevitable economic setbacks will require the dismissal of many workers."

　　美帝及其走狗吉田内阁正加紧反共反劳工活动
    【新华社陕北二十五日电】十六日组成的美帝国主义的走狗吉田内阁，正加紧向日本劳动人民的进攻。据塔斯社二十一日引“朝日新闻”消息，吉田内阁已提出反共运动的措施。原有取缔“以反对占领为活动目的”的政党及团体的法令，日本政府正筹划予以修改，以便镇压共产党。日本政府对于修改宪法问题拟举行复决，并将审议关于建立美国型的“非日活动委员会”的各种计划。反动分子前众议员纲岛与前东京大学教授田边等目前正考虑发动广泛的反共运动计划。共产党众议员野坂参三、中西功、土桥一吉、细川贝路等，为此曾质问内阁书记长官增田。增田公开承认政府打算建立“非日活动委员会”。
    另据电通社东京讯：日本反动政府在“节省措施”的借口下，不久将解雇百分之三十的日本公务员。同时，三百万员工的生活将受该措施的影响。麦克阿瑟总部发言人二十一日公开宣称：“今年日本必须自己准备应付战后最严重的失业问题”，因为“不可避免的经济挫折将要求解雇许多工人”。
