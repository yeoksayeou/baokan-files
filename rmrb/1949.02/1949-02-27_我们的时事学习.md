　　Our electric company workers recently conducted current affairs studies. The study committee stipulated that the learning content for the first week was "Carry the Revolution Through to the End" and Chairman Mao's important statement on the current situation. Group A focused on self-study, Group B focused on attending classes, and a discussion was held on Wednesday, which was very helpful in raising everyone's ideological understanding. Old worker Shao Liqin (illiterate) said, "This is really great, the Kuomintang traitorous government is about to be defeated! Why didn't they want peace earlier? There must be a conspiracy." Comrade Qin Bingshan said, "That's right! This guy has a lot of conspiracies, we can't be fooled by him!" On Friday afternoon, a test was held, and everyone recognized Chiang Kai-shek's conspiracy with 100% accuracy in their answer sheets and had strong confidence in the victory of the revolution. Comrade Li Shanzhang answered on the test paper: "The Kuomintang reactionaries have reached the end of the road and want to use political conspiracies to seek peace, so as to instigate some people who have connections with both reactionary labor and the revolution to join the revolutionary camp, creating an opposition faction in the revolutionary camp to make things difficult for us. We must be vigilant and not be fooled by him." Comrade Meng Guanchao answered, "We must follow the eight proposals published by Chairman Mao to achieve true peace, so that the sacrifices of our thousands of comrades are not in vain." After this test, everyone had a new understanding of the current situation, and their attitude towards learning became more serious. Even the old workers Shao Liqin and Chen Ruilin, who could not write, buried themselves in their studies. Shao Liqin said, "I am old and my brain is stupid, but these things must be learned. In the past, those bastards never cared about us! Today everyone patiently teaches me, and I will definitely study hard."
　　Now the study committee has also formulated a study plan for the next semester: to study a brief history of social development. Everyone is enthusiastically preparing, some buying books and notebooks, all with the confidence of "must study hard".

　　我们的时事学习
    石市电灯厂工人赵萍
    我们电灯公司工人最近进行了时事学习，学委会规定，第一期一个礼拜的学习内容是：“将革命进行到底”及毛主席对时局重要声明。甲组着重自学，乙组着重上课，在星期三并举行了讨论会；对提高大家思想认识很有帮助。老工人邵立勤（不识字）说：“真是好，眼看就要打垮国民党卖国政府啦！想和，早为啥不和？一定有阴谋。”工友秦丙山同志说：“对！这小子阴谋很多，咱们可不上他的当啦！”星期五下午又举行测验，在答卷上大家都百分之百的认识了蒋介石的阴谋；并对革命胜利抱有坚强信心。李善彰同志在测验卷上答：“国民党反动派到了穷途末路，想用政治阴谋进行求和，好策动一些与反动劳力与革命都有联系的人参加革命阵营，造成在革命阵营中的反对派，来和我们为难，我们要警惕不上他的当。”工友孟观潮答说：“一定要依毛主席发表的八条主张才是真正的和平，才不使我们千万同志白白牺牲。”经过这次测验，使大家对时局有了新的认识；学习态度也认真了。连不会写字的老工友邵立勤、陈瑞林也埋头学习。邵立勤说：“上年纪了，脑筋笨，不过这些事情非学不行。过去那些忘八蛋们谁关心咱们呀！今天大家耐心教我，我一定好好学习。”
    现在学委会又规定了下学期的学习计划：学习社会发展简史。大家正热心地准备，有的自己买书、买笔记本，都抱着“一定要好好学习”的信心。
