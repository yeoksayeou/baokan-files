　　American Journalists'
  　Slanderous Activities in East Germany
    Krotkov
    In Sanssouci, Potsdam, a memorial service was held to commemorate the anniversary of the late Empress Augusta, wife of Kaiser Wilhelm I. Readers may recall the scandal of her missing jewels. Now, an American journalist reports that clues to the stolen jewels seem to have been found in the Soviet zone, and that the Empress's death in Frankfurt was suspicious. Another American journalist followed suit with similar nonsense. The number of American journalists in Potsdam actually exceeds the number of German churchgoers at services. They closely surrounded the Empress's daughter, Caroline, and her young son, asking them bizarre questions and recording the names of everyone who sent wreaths. Their newspapers published these stories with sensational headlines. Later, Soviet journalists investigated and discovered the truth. The truth was not sensational: the jewels were taken from Caroline by the American police. This was a simple matter that could have been easily verified. However, the American journalists did not mention this, instead seizing the opportunity to blame others.
    Two months later, when the murderers of the Sachsenhausen concentration camp were on trial in Berlin, the same group of American journalists showed no interest in this major event. This was a trial of extreme importance, demonstrating the end of fascist terror for the German people and illustrating the fairness of the Soviet court. Yet, Western European and American newspapers gave this news very little space. I spoke with many Western journalists in the courtroom, and most of them were primarily interested in the appearance of the trial, namely the judge's uniform, the Soviet defense lawyers, and the architecture of the courtroom. Very few of them showed concern for the substance of the trial.
    Regarding this, a French journalist told me: It is quite natural, American newspapers only publish anti-Soviet articles.
    Among the American journalists in Berlin, there is one named O'Donnell, a reporter for the extremely reactionary "Newsweek." O'Donnell is a typical product of the Hearst, McCormick, and Patterson yellow journalism syndicate. This cultural bandit acts as the leader of the American journalist group, boasting about his reactionary news and anti-Soviet bias; and openly admitting that he served as an intelligence officer during the war.
    Last June, O'Donnell led a group of American journalists on a visit to the Soviet zone. We had the opportunity to understand how they fabricated their "free" news. In Leipzig, they stopped their cars, and when a crowd of Germans gathered, they threw cigarettes and American candy to them. Then they filmed this scene. Later, O'Donnell declared: the people welcomed them and shouted, "God, when will the Americans return?"
    In Weimar, these journalists attempted to fabricate another fake scene. While visiting the Nietzsche archives, they threw dirty rags and garbage on the table where Nietzsche's plaster bust was placed, and put a can of leftover meat and vegetables beside it, intending to photograph this scene to show "Soviet barbarians destroying German culture." Soviet officers immediately stopped them, and O'Donnell looked extremely embarrassed.
    O'Donnell and his companions had no desire to learn about what would naturally interest any honest and objective observer: the democratic reforms being implemented in the Soviet zone. Clearly, they could only earn dollars through slander and fabrication.
    Another "Newsweek" journalist, Howard, described the location of the Soviet news agency—a place familiar to American and British journalists:
    "Number 15 Baxterstrasse, Weissensee district, in the Soviet sector of Berlin, is a magnificent brown stone house, guarded day and night by a platoon of Soviet soldiers and sixteen German security police. It is a house with strict security. Everyone entering or leaving this solemn Berlin building must be thoroughly searched."
    A Soviet sentry checking entry permits here (and he acts the same as sentries at other government offices of the Allied powers in Berlin), was exaggerated as a platoon of soldiers and sixteen German security police.
    The American occupation authorities are attempting to instill this approach of their journalists into the German press. They have established special schools and short-term training courses for training German journalists. For example, the "Stars and Stripes" (American military newspaper) has a ten-day short-term training course, where the "instructors" are all writers of American yellow journalism.

　　美国记者们
  　在东德的造谣诽谤活动
    克罗特科夫
    在波茨坦的桑索西，曾举行追念前威廉大帝皇后忌辰的纪念会。读者总还记得她的珠宝不翼而飞的丑闻。现在某美国记者却报导说：珍宝失窃案似乎曾经在苏占区发现线索，而且皇后死在法兰克福事属离奇。另一美国记者又依样画葫芦地瞎说一通。在波茨坦的美国记者的人数，实际上比在教堂里做礼拜的德国教徒还多。他们紧紧包围皇后的女儿加罗琳和他年青的幼子，并提出一些鬼里鬼怪的问题问他们，而且把送花圈的人底姓名通通记下。他们的报纸用耸人听闻的标题登出这些故事。后来苏联记者就进行调查，发觉了事情的真象。这些真象确无哄动人心之处：珠宝是被美国警察从加罗琳那里拿走了。这是一个很容易确定的单纯的事情。可是，美国记者对此一字不提，却在那里乘暇蹈隙，诿罪于人。
    两个月以后，当沙赫森豪森集中营的杀人犯在柏林受审时，就是这同一批美国记者，却对这件大事表示毫无兴趣。这是一个极重要的审判，它显示法西斯主义对德国人民的恐怖底终结，并表明苏联法庭是何等的公正，但西欧和美国报纸却用极小的篇幅来登载这个消息。我在法庭中曾与许多西方记者交谈，他们之中大部分人主要地只对审判的外观感到兴趣，那就是法官的制服、苏联的辩护律师和法庭的建筑型式。他们中很少有人对审判的实质表示关心。
    关于这一点，一个法国记者对我说：这是十分自然的事情，美国报纸只登反苏的稿件。
    在柏林的美国记者中，有一个名叫奥顿尼尔的，他是极端反动的“新闻周刊”的记者。奥顿尼尔是亲法西斯的赫斯特、麦考米克和派德逊系黄色新闻的典型产物。这个文化匪徒俨然是美国记者群中的领袖人物，他夸耀他的反动消息和反苏偏见；而且毫不隐晦他在战时曾任谍报人员。
    去年六月，奥顿尼尔率领美国记者团访问苏占区，我们获得了了解他们制造他们的“自由”消息的机会。在莱比锡，他们把汽车停下来，等到有一群德国人聚集拢来时，便把香烟和美国糖果抛向他们。于是他们就将这个镜头摄入照像机，后来奥顿尼尔扬言：人民欢迎他们，并高呼“上帝呀，美国人什么时候再回来呢？”
    在魏玛地方，这些记者企图再虚构一个假场面。在参观尼采档案的时候，他们把一些肮脏的烂布和垃圾丢到放尼采石膏像的桌子上，而且把一个装剩肉菜的罐子放在旁边，准备把这种情景摄入镜头，以表示“苏联蛮子毁灭德国文化”。苏联军官立刻加以制止，奥顿尼尔表现狼狈不堪。
    奥顿尼尔和他的同伴们，决不想知道对任何诚实而客观的观察家所必然感觉兴趣的事：在苏占区所实现的民主改革情况。他们显然只有用造谣诽谤和捏造消息才能得到美元。
    另一个“新闻周刊”的记者霍华德描写苏联新闻处处址——这是美英记者很熟悉的地方：
    “柏林苏占区的魏森西区巴克斯特拉斯街十五号，是一所堂皇的褐色石头房子，有一连苏军和十六个德国保安警察日夜防守着。这是一所门禁森严的房屋。一切进出这样庄严的柏林建筑物的人，都须受到彻底的搜查。”
    在这里检验出入证的一个苏联哨兵（他和柏林其他盟国当局的官署的哨兵一样地行事），被这样夸大成为一连人和十六个德国保安警察了。
    美国占领当局正在企图把他们的记者底这一套灌输给德国报界。他们建立了训练德国记者的特种学校和短期训练班。例如“星条报”（美军机关报）便设有一个十日短期训练班，“教官”都是美国黄色新闻的撰稿人。
