Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, February 15th: TASS, Moscow: On February 1st, the Yugoslav Ministry of Foreign Affairs delivered to the Soviet Embassy in Belgrade a note from the Yugoslav government regarding the economic conference held in January by representatives of the Soviet Union, Bulgaria, Hungary, Poland, Romania, and Czechoslovakia, and the establishment of the Council for Mutual Economic Assistance by the aforementioned countries. On February 11th, the Soviet Chargé d'Affaires in Yugoslavia delivered the Soviet government's reply to the Yugoslav government's note to Yugoslav Foreign Minister Kardelj. The reply is as follows: "The Soviet government has considered the note of the Government of the Federal People's Republic of Yugoslavia dated February 1, 1949, which expresses 'astonishment' that Yugoslavia was not invited to the economic conference held in Moscow in January 1949 by representatives of the Soviet Union, Bulgaria, Hungary, Poland, Romania, and Czechoslovakia, and asserts that this constitutes a 'discriminatory' action against Yugoslavia, which is 'contrary' to the existing treaties concluded between Yugoslavia and the Soviet Union and other countries participating in the aforementioned conference. The Soviet government considers that the above-quoted assertion of the Yugoslav government is completely unfounded, because Yugoslavia itself has adopted a hostile attitude towards the Soviet Union and the people's democracies, thus precluding the possibility of Yugoslavia's participation in the Moscow conference. The Soviet government considers it necessary to point out that the South Korean government's hostile attitude towards the Soviet Union is in extreme contradiction with the Soviet-South Korean Treaty of Friendship and Mutual Assistance and the obligations that Yugoslavia should bear under that treaty. Because of this, the South Korean government has no reason to express surprise that South Korean representatives were not invited to participate in the aforementioned Moscow conference, and no reason to speak of discrimination. As for the issue of 'equal rights' and 'complete equality' of all member states of the committee mentioned in the South Korean government's note, this principle has consistently been the foundation of the policies of the Soviet Union and the people's democracies. It is precisely the policies of the Yugoslav government that violate this principle, and the attempt to portray this principle as something new in the policies of the Soviet Union and the people's democracies is only sufficient to once again prove the hypocrisy of the South Korean government. The Yugoslav government has put forward two conditions for participating in the Council for Mutual Economic Assistance: First, the South Korean government demands that the treaties of friendship and mutual assistance it has concluded with the Soviet Union and the people's democracies continue to be in effect, treaties that it claims have been violated by the Soviet Union and the people's democracies. The Soviet government considers that this excuse of the South Korean government is completely false and is intended to deceive the South Korean people. In fact, it is precisely the South Korean government, which has replaced its original pro-Soviet policy with a hostile government, that has violated these treaties and obligations, and not anyone else. Second, the South Korean government demands the cessation of the movement that it says is being used against Yugoslavia. This excuse is also completely false and is intended to deceive the South Korean people; because, in any case, the South Korean government knows that neither the Soviet Union nor the people's democracies are conducting any movement against Yugoslavia, but they do criticize the South Korean government's hostile policy towards the Soviet Union and the people's democracies. It is no secret to anyone that the Yugoslav government is conducting large-scale retaliatory actions and mass arrests against those citizens who advocate friendship with the Soviet Union and the people's democracies. These retaliatory actions and arrests can only be regarded as a manifestation of a hostile policy towards the Soviet Union and the people's democracies. The establishment of the Council for Mutual Economic Assistance is not for ordinary economic cooperation in commerce as exists between the Soviet Union and Belgium or the Netherlands, but for broad economic cooperation between countries that abide by honest and friendly policies towards each other. The Soviet government is willing for Yugoslavia to participate in the Council for Mutual Economic Assistance. However, Yugoslavia's participation in the Council for Mutual Economic Assistance is only possible when the South Korean government abandons its hostile policy towards the Soviet Union and the people's democracies."

　　苏联政府答复南政府揭露铁托集团的阴谋
    【新华社陕北十五日电】塔斯社莫斯科讯：南斯拉夫外交部二月一日曾将南斯拉夫政府关于一月间所举行的苏、保、匈、波、罗、捷六国代表经济会议及上述各国成立经济互助委员会的照会递交苏联驻贝尔格莱德大使馆。二月十一日，苏联驻南斯拉夫代办将苏联政府对南斯拉夫政府照会的复文递交南外长卡德尔。复文如下：“苏联政府已经考虑了南斯拉夫联邦人民共和国政府一九四九年二月一日的照会，照会表示因南斯拉夫未被邀请参加苏、保、匈、波、罗、捷六国代表一九四九年一月在莫斯科举行的经济会议而感‘惊异’，并断言：这样一来，便对南斯拉夫作出了‘歧视’行动，而这是与南斯拉夫和苏联及其他参加上述会议国家所缔订的现存各项条约‘抵触’的。苏联政府认为，上引南斯拉夫政府之断言，是毫无根据的，因为南斯拉夫本身业已对苏联及各人民民主国家采取敌视态度，因而杜绝了南斯拉夫参加莫斯科会议的可能性。苏联政府认为必须指出：南国政府的对苏敌视态度，是与南苏友好与互助条约及南斯拉夫因该条约所应担负的义务极度抵触的。因为如此，南国政府便没有理由表示因南国代表未被邀请参加上述莫斯科会议而感惊异，也没有理由说什么歧视。至于南国政府照会中所提委员会一切会员国‘平权’及‘完全平等’的问题，这个原则一贯都是苏联及各人民民主国家政策的基础。违犯这个原则的，恰恰是南斯拉夫政府的政策，而把这个原则说成是苏联与各人民民主国家政策中某种新的东西的企图，只足以再度证明南国政府的伪善。南斯拉夫政府提出了参加经济互助委员会的两个条件：第一，南国政府要求它与苏联及各人民民主国家所订的友好互助条约继续生效，据说这些友好互助条约已被苏联及各人民民主国家所违犯。苏联政府认为，南斯拉夫政府的这个借口是澈头澈尾虚假的，是打算以此欺＠南斯拉夫人民的。事实上，违犯了这些条约和义务的，正是以对苏敌视政府代替了原来的对苏友好政策的南国政府，而不是任何别人。第二，南国政府要求停止据它说是用以反对南斯拉夫的运动。这个借口也同样是澈头澈尾虚假的，并且是打算以此欺蒙南斯拉夫人民的；因为，南国政府无论如何总知道，不论苏联或各人民民主国家，都没有进行任何运动来反对南斯拉夫，但它们倒的确批评了南国政府对苏联及各人民民主国家的敌视政策。南斯拉夫政府正对那些主张对苏联及各人民民主国家友好的公民，进行大规模的报复行动和大批逮捕，这对任何人都已不是什么秘密了。这些报复行动与逮捕，只能估计为对苏联及人民民主国家敌视政策的表现。经济互助委员会之成立，不是为了在有如苏联与比利时或与荷兰之间所存在的商业上普通的经济合作，而是为了在彼此遵奉诚实与友好政策的各国之间进行广泛的经济合作。苏联政府愿意南斯拉夫参加经济互助委员会。但是，只有当南国政府抛弃了对苏联及各人民民主国家敌视政策时，南斯拉夫参加经济互助委员会才有可能。”
