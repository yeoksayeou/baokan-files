Learning Dynamics

　　The Quyang County Committee Decides to
  　Persist in Learning
    △ In order to strengthen the learning of cadres in service, the Quyang County Committee of the Communist Party of China convened a mobilization meeting for personnel from various agencies on the seventh of last month. At the meeting, Comrade Wang Qiufang, Secretary of the County Party Committee, gave a report on the County Party Committee's review of the leadership of on-the-job cadre learning over the past six months. The main point was that cadres' learning suffered from "hot and cold disease," and there were no regular inspections. Some comrades believed that learning was just a formality, and at the same time, they believed that learning was in opposition to work. In order to overcome the shortcomings in past learning, it was decided to strengthen unified leadership, persist in learning, and establish wall newspapers in units of agencies, setting up question-and-answer columns to solve the difficulties in cadre learning. The County Party Committee also put forward the call of "spend less money, buy more books."

　　曲阳县委会决定
  　将学习坚持下去
    △为加强在职干部的学习，中共曲阳县委会曾于上月七日召开了一次各机关人员学习动员大会。会上县委书记王秋芳同志，将县委对半年来领导在职干部学习检查，作了报告，主要是干部学习犯了冷热病，没有定期检查。有些同志认为学习是交差，同时认为学习是和工作对立的。为了克服过去学习上的缺点，决定加强统一领导，将学习坚持下去，并以机关为单位，建立墙报，设问答栏以解决干部学习中的疑难。县委并提出了“少化钱，多买书”的号召。
