　　New Outlook of Workers in Tangshan
　　Establishing Democratic Pacts, Everyone Earnestly Implements Them
　　Since liberation, the enthusiasm of workers at the Tangshan Telegraph Bureau has been rising daily. In the past, each switchboard operator was in charge of one machine (one machine had one hundred number holes), but now they are on average in charge of one and a half machines. Although the work is very busy, no one complains of being tired. Recently, all worker units have, through democratic means, successively passed the establishment of covenants, stipulating: "No unwarranted absenteeism, absence from work requires prior leave, cherish public property, unite and love each other, complete today's work today, and be conscientious and responsible in work," etc. On the one hand, they also take into account learning, proposing "When there is no work at hand, read books and newspapers." After the establishment of the covenants, everyone said, "These covenants are not like those under the Kuomintang, where a few people made the rules, regardless of whether they were suitable for everyone, and forced us to abide by them. This time, we all discussed them ourselves, so everyone must earnestly implement them." Now, large-character covenants are prominently posted in all units. As a result, everyone's work enthusiasm has become even more vigorous. Staff in the business section even voluntarily work extra night shifts to rush-write telephone cards and bills.
　　Establishing Workers' Cooperative, Workers Enthusiastically Buy Shares
　　Representatives of the Qixin Trade Union Preparatory Committee and responsible comrades of the trade union, in order to safeguard the interests of the workers, resolved to establish a cooperative. They convened a general meeting of all workers on the morning of the 20th. Initially, workers were not interested in running a cooperative because of the painful experiences left to them by the Chiang Kai-shek bandits in the past. Some workers said, "We also bought shares in the previous cooperative, but we had to queue up to buy things, and we might not be able to buy anything after waiting all day, and it would also delay a shift." Some said, "The things in our previous cooperative were more expensive than outside." Comrade Zhao Guang from the district explained at the meeting that the task of the cooperative in the future is to maintain the interests of the workers and to facilitate the workers. Its organization is based on the following basic principles: (1) Workers have absolute freedom to buy and withdraw shares; (2) Members have the right to supervise, criticize, and make suggestions; (3) Dividends shall not exceed 20%; (4) Cooperative staff shall be elected or hired by the workers' congress and employed after being approved by the congress; (5) Only shareholders are entitled to enjoy the welfare of the cooperative. After this meeting, the workers understood the nature of the cooperative and enthusiastically registered to buy shares. On the 20th alone, the number of shares purchased accounted for about one-half of the total number of workers. On the first day of its establishment, the cooperative borrowed a large sum of money from the bank to exchange cement coupons for workers, and contacted trading companies to buy a large number of peanut oil, flour, and miscellaneous grains, which were sold to workers at low prices, solving the workers' livelihood and New Year's problems. Therefore, it has won the support and trust of the workers, and changed the previous distrust of cooperatives. Everyone said, "This cooperative is guaranteed not to be corrupt!"
　　Rickshaw Workers Switch to Doing Transport and Sales
　　Livelihood Problems are Guaranteed
　　With the support of the democratic government, rickshaw workers in Tangshan have switched to engaging in transport and sales, and have achieved initial success. There are a total of one hundred and forty-three rickshaw workers in the first district of the city. From January 4th to 29th, fifty-nine people have switched professions. Among them, fifty-six people have organized fourteen production teams to engage in transport and sales. They have borrowed a total of 30.4 million yuan from the bank (Changcheng notes, same below). After twenty-five days of hard work, they have solved the livelihood problems of each person. According to the statistics of only forty people, they have made a profit of 11.45 million yuan in twenty-nine days. The Jiang Fuqi team of three people earned 830 catties of corn after three trips of transport and sales, enough for their nineteen family members to eat for twenty-one days. In order to summarize this experience and improve the business of each team in the future, the district convened a joint meeting of the heads of each production team on January 27th, and summarized four points of experience:
　　(1) Team members must be united, and small problems should be mutually forgiven. The team leader must be responsible, and must centralize leadership, and must not affect the public because of the inconsistent opinions of a few people. (2) Be able to endure hardship and be patient. Engaging in transport and sales does not necessarily mean making money every time. You must not be discouraged when you encounter failure. (3) There must be a division of labor internally, and try to send fewer people outside, and the round trip must be fast to reduce the waste of travel expenses. (4) Funds must be turned over more often, and absolutely cannot be hoarded for speculation. In terms of district leadership, there are also three points that should be paid attention to: (1) Focus on cultivating one team to gain experience and promote the overall situation. (2) Hold meetings frequently to exchange experiences, review problems, and correct deviations. (3) Frequently explain policies to them so that they become models for implementing financial and trade policies.
　　Abolishing the Unreasonable Contracting System
　　Everyone's Enthusiasm is Exceptionally High
　　During the Kuomintang rule, the workers of the Zhao Ge Zhuang Coal Mine Materials Factory constantly struggled to change the individual contracting system to a shareholding contracting system. However, due to the meddling of the contractor Zhang Fushou and five Kuomintang puppet trade union committee members (armed shareholders), the workers' just demands were not only not achieved, but suffered even greater oppression. If there was any slight violation, they would be reprimanded or fined. After the liberation of Zhao Ge Zhuang, Zhang Fushou fled with the bandits, and the contracting rights were still controlled by several external shareholders. The workers said in twos and threes, "The Communist Party is here, the workers are in charge, we must ask the mine to abolish the armed shareholders." "Yes! The world has changed, and they can no longer exploit and oppress us." So sixteen workers held a meeting and elected Hu Jinzhai and others as representatives, and through their own trade union preparatory committee, made the following demands to the mine: (1) Abolish the unreasonable external shareholders. (2) The contracting rights are to be the responsibility of the workers. (3) When Zhang Fushou returns, the workers and him will operate together, he will have one share, and all the workers will have five shares.
　　The workers' above demands were answered satisfactorily, and began to be implemented on February 1. Everyone's enthusiasm was exceptionally high. Representative Hu Jinzhai said to everyone: "Victory was given to us by the Communist Party. Everyone should unite, provide more pit props to the mine, produce more, and support the front line, so as to defeat Chiang Kai-shek as soon as possible."
　　Processing and Manufacturing Day and Night
　　Ten Days of Work Completed in Six Days
　　After the liberation of Tangshan, the consciousness and work enthusiasm of the Nanchang workers have been increasing day by day. In order to restore traffic as soon as possible and ensure the convenience of supply to the front line, they are rushing to manufacture the materials needed for the two major iron bridges, Luanhe and Jinxihe, day and night. The plan for the carriage workshop to rush to manufacture ten bridge frames was originally ten days, but after more than 300 workers worked day and night, it was completed in six days; after they accepted the task of rushing to manufacture 470 deck pieces, they overcame difficulties by collecting scattered materials in the factory in the absence of three tons of materials, and completed the task in one day. In the past, it took at least one day for the workers in the casting workshop to cast a bridge seat, but now, even though the materials are very scarce, they can cast one in just one day. Technician Yang Wanqing and others, who were sent to Anshan to guide the repair of water pumps, personally worked and completed the task ahead of schedule, and were praised by the factory. The workers of the planing machine in the machinery group rushed out the parts and two large iron seats needed for the Jinxihe iron bridge in one night. The machine section rushed to repair a 45-ton crane, and it was completed two days ahead of schedule due to their active efforts. In addition, the workers who repaired military vehicles were still working hard when it was time to eat, and their enthusiasm was very high.
　　With the Support of the Democratic Government
　　Xinming Electric Saw Factory Gets New Development
　　Tangshan Xinming Electric Saw Factory was established last spring by Wang Boran and four or five other shareholders. The factory site is the old site of the former Xinming Iron Factory. At the beginning of the factory's establishment, the business was still good. Later, the Kuomintang bandit army repaired fortifications inside and outside the city, demolishing houses and robbing wood everywhere. The Xinming factory suffered cruel devastation at this time. After a struggle, the workers finally secretly broke the electric saw and returned to their homes or relatives to temporarily maintain their lives. When Tangshan was liberated, they rejoiced and welcomed their own troops. They said, "This time we don't have to be angry!" Sure enough, in less than twenty days after liberation, this electric saw factory, which was destroyed by Chiang Kai-shek bandits, started work with the support of the democratic government. Initially, the Social Bureau of the Municipal Government Office transported a large number of wood, letting them make doors and windows for the Municipal Government. The comrades of the Social Bureau also told them, "There will be a lot of construction work after the Spring Festival, don't be afraid of not having work!" The workers excitedly said, "If the Liberation Army hadn't come, we wouldn't even be able to celebrate the New Year, but now that the Liberation Army is here, there is a way to make a living!" Manager Wang Boran also said, "This time our sawmill will also develop!"
　　Workers of Guye Refractory Materials Factory
　　One Person Does the Work of Two People
　　After the liberation of the Tangshan Steel Factory Guye Refractory Materials Factory, the workers realized that their political status had been improved. For the sake of their own factory, they all voluntarily wanted to take more responsibility and do more work. Electrical worker Wang Yuxiang voluntarily took charge of the water pump. He said, "I can manage the water pump by using the time to repair the electrical appliances, it's not tiring!" So the worker Ma Peizhong, who originally managed the water pump, went to participate in the production of dolomite bricks. In the past, there were two canteen workers in the factory. Now, Sun Xiuling, one of them, said, "I can take responsibility for cooking by myself, and I guarantee to cook the meals on time without delaying things!" Fan Changying, the worker in charge of burning the tea kettle and heating the kang, said, "I can help with cooking. Now it's much easier than when the bandits were here eating and drinking randomly!" So another worker, Lü Yanhua, was spared to participate in production. In the upsurge of workers' hard work, the staff also became active. After work, seeing that the sand bricks prepared for transportation to the steel plant were hindering traffic, the staff and workers voluntarily started together, moving, passing, and arranging, and in a short time, they moved the bricks to the appropriate location. Worker Guo Jun said, "This work is for ourselves, and we don't feel tired at all!"

　　新唐山职工近貌
  　建立民主公约大家认真执行
    唐山电讯局的职工，自解放后工作情绪一天天高涨，过去接线生每人看管一台机器（一台机器一百个号码孔），现在平均每人看管一台半机器，虽然工作非常繁忙，可没有一个人叫累。最近各职工单位，都以民主方式，纷纷通过建立公约，规定：“不准无故旷职，不上工必须事前请假，爱护公物，团结友爱，今日的事今日作完，工作要认真负责任”等。一方面又照顾到学习、提出“手底下没活计时，要看看书报。”公约建立后，大家都说：“这公约不象国民党在时那样，由少数人规定，不管大家合适不合适，硬叫咱们遵守。这回是咱们大家自己讨论过的，大家就得认真执行。”现在各单位室内都满贴很明显的大字公约。因之，每个人的工作情绪，就越发起劲。业务科职员还自动加打夜班，赶写电话卡片及帐单。
  　建立工人合作社职工们踊跃入股
    启新职工会筹委会的代表和职工会的负责同志，为了维护职工的利益，决议成立合作社。于二十日早晨召开职工全体大会。最初，工友们因为过去蒋匪统治时曾遗留给他们惨痛的经验，故此对办合作社都不感到兴趣，有的工友说：“以前那个合作社我们也入了股，可是买东西时要排队，等一天不一定买到，还得耽搁了一个班。”有的说：“我们以前那个合作社的东西比外面还贵。”经区里赵光同志在大会上说明今后合作社的任务是以维护工人利益，便利工人为目的，它的组织是建立在下面几个基本原则上：（一）工人入股退股有绝对自由权；（二）社员有监督、批评、建议的权利；（三）红利最多不得超过百分之二十；（四）合作社职员由职工大会选举或聘请，经大会通过而任用；（五）凡入股的社员才有享受本社福利权。经过这个大会后，工人都明了合作社的性质，踊跃登记入股，仅二十号一天入股的，约占职工总人数的二分之一。该社成立的第一天，就从银行借到大批款子，给工人兑换洋灰券，并和贸易公司取得联系，买了大批花生油、面粉和杂粮，廉价卖给工人，解决了工人生活和年关问题。因此取得了工人的拥护和信任，改变了以前对合作社不信任的观念，大家都说：“这个合作社保险不会贪污！”
  　洋车工人转搞运销
  　生活问题有了保证
    在民主政府的扶植下，唐山市洋车工人转业搞运销，已获得初步成绩。该市一区共有洋车工人一百四十三名，从一月四日到二十九日已有五十九人转业，其中有五十六人，组织起十四个生产小组搞运销，他们共向银行贷款三千零四十万元（长城券下同），经过二十五天的辛勤努力，已解决各人的生活问题。仅据四十个人的统计，二十九天内就获利一千一百四十五万元。姜福起组三个人，搞了三趟运销，就赚了玉米八百三十斤，足供他们三家十九口人二十一天的食粮。为了总结这一段经验，使今后各组的业务提高一步，该区于一月二十七日召开各生产小组长联席会议，总结出四点经验：
    （一）组员必须团结，小枝节要互相原谅。组长要负责任，要集中领导，不能因少数人意见不一致而影响大众。（二）要能吃苦，有耐心，搞运销不一定每次都赚钱，必须遇到失败不灰心。（三）内部要分工，尽量争取到外边少去人，往返要迅速，减少盘费的浪费。（四）资金要多周转，绝对不能囤积投机。在区的领导方面，也有三点应注意的：（一）有重点培养一个组，以吸取经验，推动全面。（二）经常开会，交流经验，检讨毛病，纠正偏向。（三）经常向他们讲解政策，使他们成为执行金融、贸易政策的模范。
  　取消了不合理的包工制
  　大家情绪异常高涨
    在国民党统治时，赵各庄煤矿材料厂的工人，为了要求个人包工制改为合股经营方式的包工制，曾不断的进行斗争，但由于包工头子张富寿及入股的五名国民党伪工会委员（胳膊股）从中做怪，工人的正义要求非但未达到目的，反而遭受更大的压迫，如稍有触犯便会受斥骂或罚工处分。赵各庄解放后，张富寿从匪潜逃，包工权利仍为几个外股东掌握，工人便三三两两的说：“共产党来了，工人当家，咱得向矿方要求取消胳膊股。”“对！天下换了，他们再剥削压迫咱们就不行。”于是十六个工人开会选出胡进斋等二人为代表，通过自己的职工筹委会向矿方提出要求：（一）取消不合理的外股东。（二）包工权由工人负责。（三）张富寿回来时，工人与他合股经营，他一股，全体工人五股。
    工人们的以上要求得到圆满答复，并于二月一日开始实行，大家情绪异常高涨，代表胡进斋对大家说：“胜利是共产党给咱们的，大家应当团结起来，多供给井下窑柱多生产，支援前线，好早日打垮蒋介石”。
  　不分昼夜加工赶作
  　十天工活六天完成
    唐山解放后，南厂职工的觉悟及工作积极性日益提高，为早日恢复交通，保证前线的供给便利，不分昼夜地赶造滦河和金溪河两大铁桥所需的材料，车架所赶造十个桥架的计划原为十天，经三百多工友日夜赶作，六天便全部完工；他们接受了赶造四百七十件甲板的任务后，在缺乏三吨材料的情况下，搜集厂内零星材料克服困难，一天时间内就完成任务。铸工所的工友们过去铸一个桥座最少需时一天，现在纵然材料非常缺，但仅一天便可铸一座。被派在安山指导修理水泵的技工杨万清等四人，亲自动手工作，提前完成了任务，受到厂方的表扬。机械组刨床的工友们一晚就赶出了金溪河铁桥所需的零件及两个大铁座。机务段抢修四十五吨重的起重机，在他们工作积极努力下提前两天竣工。此外如修理军用汽车的工友们，到吃饭的时间了，他们还鼓着劲的干，情绪非常高涨。
  　在民主政府扶植下
  　新明电锯厂得到新发展
    唐山新明电锯厂，是去年春季由王渤然等四五个股份建立起来的，厂址就是前新明铁厂的旧址，该厂成立之初，生意倒还不错，后来国民党匪军在市内市外大修防御工事，到处拆毁房屋，抢拉木料，新明厂就在这时候遭到残酷的摧残。工人们在经过一番斗争后，终于把电锯偷偷弄坏，忍气吞声回到自己的家或亲戚处暂时维持生活。当唐山解放后，他们便欢欣鼓舞地起来欢迎自己的队伍，他们说：“这回可用不着受气了！”果然，在解放后不够二十天中，这个被蒋匪破坏得不成样子的电锯厂便在民主政府的扶植下开工了。最初是由市府办事处社会局运来大批木料，让他们给市政府做门窗，社会局同志又告诉他们说：“春节后的建筑工作还多，不要怕没工作！”工人们兴奋地说：“解放军再不来，我们连年也过不起，现在解放军来了，生活就有办法！”王渤然经理也说：“这回我们的锯木厂还要发展起来哩！”
  　古冶耐火材料工厂职工
  　一个人顶两个人工作
    唐山制钢厂古冶耐火材料工厂的职工们解放后，都认识到自己的政治地位提高了，为着他们自己的工厂，他们都自动的愿意多负责任多作活。电气工人王玉祥，自愿兼管水泵。他说：“利用修理电气的空儿，便可把水泵管好了，这并不累啊！”于是原来管理水泵的工人马佩中便去参加了制白云石砖的生产工作。从前该厂工人伙食员原有二名，现在其中之一的孙秀岭说：“作饭我一个人就可负起责任来，还保证按时熟饭，不误事！”管烧茶锅烧炕的工人范长盈说：“我可以帮助做饭，现在比起匪军在这儿胡乱吃喝时轻闲得多哩！”于是又省下一个工人吕延华去参加生产。在工人努力生产的热潮中，职员们也积极起来了，大家下了班，见到准备运送到钢铁厂的砂砖太妨碍交通，职员工人们便自动一齐下手，搬的搬，递的递，摆的摆，一会工夫便把砖移到适当的位置。工人郭均说：“这活是给自己干的，一点儿都不觉得累！”
