Fuping Women's Congress Calls for Attention to Hygiene and Learning

　　The Fuping Women's Congress was held on January 17th. After the congress elected representatives to attend the Northern Yue District Women's Congress, it unanimously passed two resolutions:

　　(1) Strengthen women's and infant hygiene work to reduce women's suffering from diseases and reduce infant mortality rates. According to representatives, "menstrual problems" are prevalent among women in Fuping, affecting their labor and fertility. As for infant mortality rates, in Fahua Village, out of 37 children born in 1948, 9 had already died. In Gaojie Village, 7 out of 27 infants born in 1948 died.

　　Therefore, it is hoped that women's and infant hygiene work will be strengthened, and health workers should be added at the district level, or at least the drug problem should be solved.

　　(2) Women's learning issues: Generally, women have lower levels of education and weaker working abilities compared to men, the fundamental root of which is the limited educational opportunities in the past. After the land reform, women gained property rights and now urgently need culture and education. Many young and middle-aged women have few learning opportunities due to trivial family matters. Although some women have risen up to automatically organize "people's schools," they often cannot persist in learning due to family life and taking care of children. It is hoped that solutions to women's learning problems can be found in many ways, based on the specific circumstances of women.

　　阜平妇女代表大会要求注意卫生学习
    阜平妇女代表大会是一月十七日召开的。大会选举了准备参加北狱区妇女代表大会的代表后，一致通过了两项决议案：
    （一）加强妇女婴儿卫生工作，减少妇女疾病痛苦，减少婴儿的死亡率。据代表反映：阜平各地妇女普遍流行着“月经病”、以致影响劳动，影响生育。而婴儿的死亡率，就法华村来说一九四八年全村共生小孩三十七个，已死掉九个。高街村一九四八年生婴儿二十七个死去七个。
    因此希望加强妇女婴儿卫生工作，可按区为单位增设卫生员，至少亦应解决药品问题。
    （二）妇女学习问题：现在一般妇女比较男子，文化低，工作能力弱，其基本根源是过去受教育机会短。土地改革后，妇女获得了财产权，目前迫切的要求文化。许多青壮妇女因家庭事务罗嗦，学习机会很少，虽有若干妇女，奋起自动组织“民校”，可是往往因家庭生活，照顾孩子，而不能坚持学下去。希望能根据妇女具体情况，多方解决妇女学习问题。
