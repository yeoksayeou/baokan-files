　　Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 16th—The Soviet journal New Times published a special article on the deteriorating French economy, stating: The stagnation of the French economy under the Marshall Plan continues to extend to all parts of the French economic organism. In fact, French industrial production is now only 75 percent of what it was before the crisis. Since January 1948, nominal wages have increased by 16.2 percent, but real wages have decreased by more than 25 percent. Since the "American Party" came to power, the economic recovery of France has been shelved. The shipbuilding industry, which originally could build 250,000 tons of ships annually, is now only operating at half capacity due to a lack of raw materials. The reason is that the raw materials promised under the Marshall Plan have not been delivered. Two years ago, France's average monthly aircraft production was 159, while in 1948, the monthly average was only 99. At the same time, the total output of aircraft engines fell from 122,000 horsepower per month to 58,000 horsepower. On the other hand, all routes of Air France, operated by the government, use American aircraft. In 1947, the French automobile industry exported an average of 4,861 vehicles per month, while last year, it only exported 2,982 vehicles per month. Tractor production was 12,000 units less than planned. However, tractor imports from the United States were greater than originally calculated.
　　American "aid" has had a definitely bad influence on all French industries, and the situation in the power industry particularly illustrates this process. As everyone knows, among European countries, France's hydropower potential is second only to the Soviet Union. If this potential could be fully utilized, France's annual power generation could reach 60 billion kilowatt-hours. This is particularly valuable for France because it has neither oil nor sufficient coal reserves. However, drastic reductions in government loans and large reductions in material supplies have left no choice but to abandon the plan. Why? Because according to the terms of the Marshall Plan, France was required to abandon its hydropower plans. According to the so-called "Monnet Plan," coal production in the first half of last year should have been 29.5 million tons, but only 25.8 million tons were produced. The planned power generation was 15 billion kilowatt-hours, but only 13.9 billion kilowatt-hours were generated. In the whole year of 1948, steel production was only 7 million tons, while the plan had set it at 9 million tons. Tractor production was only 10,000 units, while the original plan was 22,000 units. It can be seen that the Marshall Plan not only did not help but hindered the completion of the "Monnet Plan."
　　France's foreign trade is also unfavorable in every respect. In the first three quarters of 1947, France's foreign trade deficit was 97 billion francs, while in the same period in 1948, it reached 151.5 billion francs. The trade deficit is the result of France's economic dependence on the United States. Statistics show that 33 percent of all French imports come from the United States, while the United States only purchases 6 percent of French exports. Since the advent of the Marshall Plan, France's dependence on the United States has been increasing. The majority of imports do not enhance France's economic independence. According to the Marshall Plan, the value of tobacco, glass, socks, and chewing gum imported by France is twice that of mining equipment; dried fruit is two and a half times that of rubber; and cheese and milk powder are five times that of steel industry machinery. The United States only supplies 2 percent of the industrial equipment needed by France. The import of raw materials needed by French industry has also been declining. Coal imports fell from an average of 1,200,500 tons per month in 1947 to an average of 1,148,000 tons per month in 1948. During the same period, zinc imports decreased by more than 50 percent. The French textile industry needs 22,000 tons of cotton, but only obtains 10,000 tons. All French economists, even those of the reactionary school, believe that France can only develop its manufacturing industry by increasing trade with Eastern Europe. But this is explicitly prohibited by the terms of American "aid."
　　In order to obey the strategic plans of the United States, the slogan that France must become an agricultural country, which was put forward by Pétain under the impetus of Hitler in the past, has been revived.
　　As everyone knows, without Ruhr coal to smelt the abundant iron ore of Lorraine, France's steel industry cannot be maintained. Before 1939, France imported an average of 10 million tons of Ruhr coal annually. Since liberation, it has imported 3 million tons annually. This is a direct result of the decision of the rulers in Paris to abandon reparations and adopt American "aid." Not long ago, it became known that in addition to the plan of the war-mongers in Washington to turn the Ruhr into its colony, there was also a plan to seize France's iron ore reserves, especially the Lorraine deposits. According to the strategic plan of American imperialism, French iron ore will be handed over to the control of the aggressive German war factories, just as its grain will be used to feed German mercenaries.
　　Although the French economy has been so seriously harmed by the Marshall Plan, French monopoly concerns have obtained considerable profits. French capital investment is reaping incredibly high profits of 30 percent. In the past decade, the profits of trusts have increased from 112 billion francs to 3 trillion francs.

### 在“马歇尔计划”下　法国经济陷于停滞  法对美的附属性越来越大　变成农业国的口号又复活

　　在“马歇尔计划”下
  　法国经济陷于停滞
    法对美的附属性越来越大
  　变成农业国的口号又复活
    【新华社陕北十六日电】苏联新时代杂志专文论恶化中的法国经济称：马歇尔计划化的法国经济的停滞，继续延及法国经济机体的一切部分。事实上，法国工业生产现在仅及危机以前的百分之七十五。自一九四八年一月份以来，名义工资固然增加了百分之十六点二，但实际工资却减少了百分之二十五以上。自“美记政党”上台以来，法国经济复兴已被搁置。原来每年可造船二十五万吨的造船工业，由于缺乏原料，现在仅只开动了一半，原因是马歇尔计划规定供给的这些原料，一直没有运来。两年以前，法国的飞机产量每月平均是一百五十九架，而一九四八年，每月平均仅及九十九架。同时，飞机发动机的总产量，则由每月的十二万二千匹马力降至五万八千匹马力。而另一方面，由政府经营的法兰西航空公司的一切航线，却都使用美国飞机。一九四七年，法国汽车工业每月平均输出达四千八百六十一辆，而去年，每月则仅输出二千九百八十二辆。拖拉机工业较计划少出产一万二千架。但自美国输入的拖拉机，却较原来计算的为多。
    美“援”对法国的一切工业都确定地产生了坏影响，动力工业的情势特别说明了这一过程。大家知道，在欧洲各国中，法国水力发电的潜能是仅次于苏联的，假如这些潜能能充分利用，则法国每年的发电量可以达到六百亿千瓦小时。这对法国说来是特别有价值的，因为法国既没有石油，也没有充足的煤藏。然而，政府贷款的剧烈削减和物资供应大量减少的结果，以致除了放弃计划以外，别无他途。为什么呢？因为按照马歇尔计划的条款，法国被要求放弃它的水力发电计划。按照所谓“摩纳计划”，去年前半年的产煤量应为二千九百五十万吨，但是，仅出产了二千五百八十万吨。预定发电一百五十亿千瓦小时，但仅发电一百三十九亿千瓦小时。一九四八年全年，钢产仅七百万吨，而计划曾定为九百万吨。拖拉机产量仅一万架，而计划原为二万二千架。由此可见，马歇尔计划不但不是帮助反而是妨碍了“摩纳计划”的完成。
    法国在对外贸易上，也是每件事都不如意的。一九四七年前三季，法国对外贸易赤字为九百七十亿法郎，而一九四八年同期，则达到一千五百一十五亿法郎。贸易赤字是法国经济附属于美国的结果。统计表明，法国全部输入中，来自美国的占百分之三十三，而美国却只购买了法国输出的百分之六。自马歇尔计划出现以来，法国对美国的附属性是越来越大了。输入品的大多数都不是增进法国经济独立的。法国按照马歇尔计划，输入的东西，就货值说，烟草、玻璃、袜子和口香糖为采矿装备的两倍；干果为橡皮的两倍半；乳酷和奶粉为钢铁工业机器的五倍。美国仅供给法国所需的工业装备的百分之二。法国工业所需原料的入口，也一直在下降。煤的输入由一九四七年的每月平均一百二十万零五千吨减到一九四八年的每月平均一百一十四万八千吨。同期，锌的输入减少百分之五十以上。法国纺织工业需要棉花二万二千吨，但仅获得一万吨。所有法国经济学家，甚至连那些反动学派的经济学家也都认为：只有增进与东欧的贸易，法国才能发展它的制造工业。但这是美“援”条款所明确禁止的。
    为了服从美国的战略计划，过去由贝当在希特勒推动下提出来的法国必须变成农业国的口号又在复活了。
    大家知道：没有鲁尔煤来熔炼洛林产量丰富的铁矿，法国的钢铁工业就无法维持。在一九三九年以前，法国每年平均输入鲁尔煤一千万吨。解放以来，它每年输入三百万吨。这是巴黎统治者们决定抛弃赔偿以采取美“援”的直接结果。不太久以前，大家知道了：华盛顿的战争贩子们在变鲁尔为其殖民地的计划以外，还有一个计划，这就是攫取法国铁矿蕴藏、特别是洛林矿藏的计划。依照美帝国主义的战略计划，法国铁矿将交给德国侵略性的军火工厂支配，正如同它的谷物将用以饲养德国的雇佣兵一样。
    法国经济虽然由于马歇尔计划已受到如此严重的危害，但是，法国垄断康采仑却获取了可观的利润。法国资本投资正取得难以置信的高达百分之三十的利润。在过去十年中，托辣斯的利润已由一千一百二十亿法郎增至三万亿法郎。（按：本文根据二月三日塔斯社电讯稿）
