　　Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, February 6th: The first Shaanxi-Gansu-Ningxia Border Region Student Congress, which opened in Yan'an on January 7th, concluded on the 17th after completing major tasks such as determining the current direction and tasks of the student movement in the Shaanxi-Gansu-Ningxia Border Region and establishing the Shaanxi-Gansu-Ningxia Border Region Student Federation. The student representatives attending this conference included 93 students from 16 units, including secondary schools and above in the border region, schools in the Kuomintang-controlled areas of the Northwest, and ethnic minorities in the Northwest. Responsible personnel from the Party, government, and military of the Shaanxi-Gansu-Ningxia Border Region gave various thematic lectures at the meeting, enabling young students to have a clearer understanding of the spirit of serving the people and the issue of learning attitude. The conference summarized the student movement in the Shaanxi-Gansu-Ningxia Border Region. During the War of Resistance Against Japan and the People's Liberation War, more than 6,000 secondary school students from the Shaanxi-Gansu-Ningxia Border Region participated in various aspects of work. In the Huanglong Sub-district, which was liberated less than a year ago, more than 1,000 young intellectuals have now joined the revolutionary work. During the War of Resistance Against Japan, tens of thousands of young people from all over the country came to the revolutionary holy land of Yan'an to study in various schools and participated in work in various liberated areas after graduation. Such good opportunities for young students to fully study and find employment could only be obtained under the leadership and cultivation of the Communist Party of China and the Shaanxi-Gansu-Ningxia People's Government. Regarding the general direction and general tasks of the student movement in the Shaanxi-Gansu-Ningxia Border Region in the future, the conference representatives unanimously agreed that under the current situation where the national revolution is about to be victorious, all students in the border region should carry forward their glorious traditions, unite closely, and study hard; at the same time, they should actively support the People's Liberation War, participate in various constructions in the liberated areas, and unite with the vast number of young students in the Kuomintang-controlled areas of the Northwest to eliminate the bandit armies of Hu and Ma, thoroughly liberate the Great Northwest, and build a new Northwest. Bai Huiyu and other student representatives from Northwest University who arrived in Yan'an from Xi'an to attend the conference reported on the heroic struggles recently waged by students from Northwest University and other schools against the Kuomintang bandit gang's forced relocation of schools. Bai said, "The great victory of the People's Liberation War is constantly inspiring the fighting spirit and confidence in victory of the students in the Kuomintang-controlled areas of the Northwest. The convening and successful completion of the border region student congress will be an extremely powerful support for the students in the Kuomintang-controlled areas who are currently struggling." During the current affairs discussion meeting, the student representatives, with confidence in the inevitable victory of the revolution, discussed and exposed the Nanjing reactionary government's conspiracy to play with sham peace, and unanimously passed a telegram to the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China, expressing their complete support for Chairman Mao Zedong's Eight Peace Conditions in order to strive for a truly democratic peace and oppose a hypocritical and reactionary peace. Finally, the conference elected nine executive committee members of the Shaanxi-Gansu-Ningxia Border Region Student Federation by secret ballot, officially establishing the Shaanxi-Gansu-Ningxia Border Region Student Federation, and elected Cheng Hao and Wang Liming as chairman and vice-chairman respectively. The conference also elected 14 representatives to attend the National Liberated Area Student Congress, including Cheng Hao, Li Caiping (female), Fang Xingzhe (female), Wu Jianfu (Hui nationality), and Wu Zhandong (Mongolian nationality).
