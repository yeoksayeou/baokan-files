　　"Cold War" – refers to a diplomatic offensive war between nations, so named because it does not use firearms for attack and defense. In essence, it is the "diplomatic strategy" now employed by imperialism, mainly the United States, to intimidate democratic forces around the world. Many outcries about a "Third World War" and the absurd propaganda of a "Soviet threat to peace" are performances of this "Cold War." This is a gangster tactic that imperialism habitually uses in the international arena, merely exposing the paper tiger nature of imperialism, and no one but the neurotic will be intimidated by it.
　　Szakasits – is the current President of the Republic of Hungary. He was born in 1888 in a working-class family of artisans in Budapest. He studied carpentry and stonemasonry, and in 1919 worked for the "Social Democratic Daily," later serving as its editor-in-chief. He was imprisoned for political activities. During World War II, he led underground activities. After the war, he was elected General Secretary of the Social Democratic Party, leading the purge of right-wing elements within the Social Democratic Party and advocating cooperation with the Hungarian Communist Party. He has served as Deputy Prime Minister since 1945.

    “冷战”——是指国际间的外交攻势战，因为不是用火器来攻防，故名“冷战”。实质上便是现在的帝国主义，主要是美国，用来向世界民主力量实行恫吓的“外交策略”，不少的关于“第三次世界大战”的叫嚣，“苏联威胁和平”的荒谬宣传等等都是这种“冷战”的表演。这是帝国主义在国际上惯耍的流氓手段，只是暴露了帝国主义纸老虎的本质，除了神经衰弱者以外，谁也不会被吓住的。
