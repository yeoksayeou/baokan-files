　　Ping Shun Education Section Arranges Educational Study
    △The Ping Shun Education Section convened a meeting of education assistants from various districts and principals of central schools on the 23rd of last month, putting forward the slogan that teachers should emphasize learning in their work. It was decided that teachers with higher education should study "The Chinese Revolution and the Chinese Communist Party" and "The Current Situation and Our Tasks," while teachers with lower education should first learn Mandarin and arithmetic, and then combine this with studying policies. At this meeting, everyone unanimously agreed that strengthening personal learning and improving education amidst busy schedules is a powerful weapon for doing good work.

　　平顺教育科布置教育学习
    △平顺教育科于上月二十三日召开各区教育助理员及中心学校校长会议，提出了教员在工作中应强调学习的口号、并决定文化高的教员学习“中国革命与中国共产党”，“目前形势与我们的任务”，文化低的教员首先学会国语、算术，再结合学习政策。这个会上，大家一致认为从百忙中加强个人学习，提高文化是搞好工作的有力武器。  　　　　（龙元庆　张富贵）
