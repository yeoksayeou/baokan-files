Double Red Flags
　　　　Lu Mei
　　　　(I)
　　Wang Chengbao and Li Chunjie were two fine yarn spinning machine operators, working in the same section.
　　Wang Chengbao was a male worker, in his forties; a notorious troublemaker before liberation, nicknamed "Knot-Making Master." Back then, he could operate twenty spindles. But when he got excited, his simple-mindedness would kick in, and he'd demand that the supervisor let him operate five fewer spindles; if the supervisor insisted on him operating twenty, he wouldn't say anything else, just refuse to put in the effort, letting the yarn break and not rejoining it, letting it knot up. Li Chunjie was a female worker, eighteen years old. Also a notorious troublemaker before liberation, nicknamed "Little Grumbler." Back then, when her grumbling spirit came over her, she'd sit down on the spot when she saw the supervisor coming, and hug her head with both hands. When the supervisor told her to get up, she'd say her stomach hurt; the supervisor could never get the better of her.
　　After liberation, the factory's spinning department switched to an eight-hour workday, no body searches, no beatings or scolding, and workers could buy cloth at 20% off; workers' lives improved, their status was raised, and they often attended political classes that explained the relationship between the Communist Party and the workers. Therefore, many workers who used to goof off at work improved and understood that today's production was for the people, for themselves, to overthrow Chiang Kai-shek, and they worked very hard. Li Chunjie was one of these people. But there were also a few people who didn't use their brains, weren't enlightened enough, and their old habits didn't go away, liking to slack off. Wang Chengbao was one of these.
　　Li Chunjie's work attitude had changed, but she was still sharp, good at teasing people, always talking or singing, her mouth never idle. So, her being in the same section as Wang Chengbao was like a simpleton meeting a grumbler, truly a clash of the titans.
　　Usually, Wang Chengbao liked to run off, going to the roving room to smoke at least once every time he spun a bobbin. If things lined up just right, he would often skip work, which made Li Chunjie look down on him a bit, but she didn't really care. When the machine competition came, Li Chunjie thought, "If his machine isn't good, my end will not get a red flag, no matter how clean it is." At the same time, the administrator gave a speech, saying that the machine competition was about uniting with others and working together; so after Chunjie finished her work, she helped Chengbao, joining broken ends and tightening the roving shaft. She also advised Chengbao: "Look, it's the machine competition, we have to join the broken ends faster and produce less waste cotton... and you should go to the roving room to smoke less!" Wang Chengbao said: "Smoking, is that a small thing? Today I'm alive, I'll smoke for a lifetime; even my old man doesn't tell me what to do, and you're telling me!..." He was half annoyed, half laughing, half serious, half joking. Li Chunjie said: "When the week is up, other people will have red flags, and we won't have one, how embarrassing!" Wang Chengbao "loftily" said: "Get that! --Hmph, it's all a trick to fool the idiots, we don't care about fast or slow, as long as our hands aren't idle, that's all that matters." Li Chunjie got angry when she heard that, "You're smart, we're stupid! If you don't want it, I do, you can't tire me out!" Chengbao said with a grin: "I don't want it, I won't compete with you little girls for that, if the red flag is hung on my machine, so many of you won't get it, and you'll all start crying!" Chunjie was so angry that she cursed him, "Hmph, so unlucky, how did I end up with a simpleton like you!" Sometimes Chengbao would deliberately "make trouble" for Chunjie. That day, the inspector came over, and Chengbao said: "Comrade, look how clean Chunjie's machine is, go ahead and report it, report her as a model!" Chunjie said: "You don't need to say that, other people's machines are so clean, our machine is so dirty, it'll be bad for our reputation!" Chengbao said: "Good reputation!? --Bring all the cotton from your house and give it to the factory, that'll be a good reputation, they'll be sure to put you on the blackboard bulletin!"
　　In the end, "Little Grumbler" was no match for the "Knot-Making Master," Chunjie couldn't deal with Chengbao, so she went to find the other two female machine operators, Xianni and Yuexiang. Because the machine competition organization was four machine operators, two machines per group. The competition conditions were high output, low waste cotton, clean machines, no absenteeism, and no running off. Chunjie discussed it with Xianni and Yuexiang. Chunjie said, "Let's split up with Wang Chengbao!" Xianni and Yuexiang asked, "How do we split up?" Chunjie said, "He's always running to the roving room, always making knots, producing so much waste cotton, let's separate from him!" Xianni and Yuexiang asked again how to separate. Chunjie said, "Let's separate the waste cotton, each of us putting it in a container, not mixing it with Chengbao's, so it's separated when we report it." Xianni and Yuexiang happily said: "That's right, this way it'll be clear who's good and who's bad, and the higher-ups will know too, otherwise, he's always dragging us down, we can't really work hard..." As a result, the four of them split up like this.
　　That day they were on the night shift, getting off work at seven, reporting the waste cotton at five. The group leader came over with the scale, pushing the waste cotton box. The four of them took out their own waste cotton and put it on the machine head. The three of them, Chunjie, Xianni, and Yuexiang, each had a fist-sized amount, but Chengbao had a tightly packed, large pile, bigger than a head. In comparison, Chengbao couldn't help but blush, and he had a thought, saying: "You don't need to report it, I have a lot anyway, I can't possibly outwork the three of you, you're always secretly throwing waste cotton into my container, worrying me that I have so much!" As he spoke, he hurriedly mixed the waste cotton from the others together with his own, stirring it vigorously, making it impossible to tell who was who's. The result was about one and a half jin. Fortunately, Chunjie was quick-eyed and quick-handed, and when she heard Chengbao's words were off, she quickly put away her own pile, resulting in about two liang. According to Chunjie's two liang, Xianni and Yuexiang should have four liang, so Chengbao had a total of one jin and four liang of waste cotton, which was not a problem. Xianni and Yuexiang were honest children, and although they cursed Chengbao a few times, Chengbao ignored them, and they suffered in silence.
　　After ten days, when it was announced, many people got the red flag, but Chengbao, Chunjie, Xianni, and Yuexiang weren't among them. Of course, there were other machines that didn't get it either.

　　　　(II)
　　As soon as Chunjie entered the factory, she saw that many machines had red flags on them. Many small red silk flags were like many red lanterns, lighting up the whole factory, making Chunjie's eyes blur. As she walked further in, she saw her own machine, dark and gloomy, only seeing the large black iron plate on the machine head, nothing had changed. And that wasn't all, some nosy young female workers pulled Chunjie to their machine, raised the corner of the flag inserted on their machine, and said: "Chunjie, do you recognize it, look, these two white characters are 'Model', Model!" Another person came over, held out their right hand, clenched four fingers, only extending and moving the little finger towards Chunjie, saying: "Little Grumbler, you really are this!" And that wasn't all, another person joined in, adding fuel to the fire, saying: "Little Grumbler, you can't get the better of Knot-Making Master, eh!..." Chunjie was so anxious that she broke free from their encirclement, hitting their butts and heads at random, cursing: "You little brats, you little brats..." and escaped to her own machine.
　　Needless to say, Li Chunjie was very angry. All she did was bury her head in joining the broken ends, getting angrier as she joined. She thought: I don't even have time to drink water all day, I don't even have time to eat, sometimes I don't even run when the alarm goes off, all for the sake of high output and a clean machine. I even help him after I finish my own machine, but he's so ungrateful... If the machine doesn't have a red flag, it shows how backward I am, doesn't it?... Thinking and thinking, she couldn't join the ends, so she went to the roving worker who helped her, Bai Yuhua, to say: "Sister Yuhua, we're always stuck to the machine, staring at it with our eyes, wishing we could see a hole in it, how much effort we put in, but he hurts me so much, I'm going to ask the group leader to change machines!..." Roving worker Bai Yuhua comforted her a few times, and after everyone joined the ends, she pulled Chengbao, Xianni, Yuexiang, and Chunjie together, held a small meeting, persuaded Chengbao to work harder, and persuaded everyone to unite. Finally, she encouraged everyone, saying: "After I'm done roving, I'll help you join the ends and clean the machine more, we didn't get a red flag this time, but we'll see next time!" After the meeting, Chengbao looked like he was a little unconvinced, but he didn't say it out loud, and went to join the ends again. After a while, the young girls who had been teasing Chunjie earlier, seeing that they had a meeting, came to Chunjie's machine with smiles on their faces. This time they weren't coming to settle the score with Chunjie, they were coming for Chengbao. They teased Chengbao: "What kind of meeting was that?" Chengbao glared, looking down on them, and went to join the ends again. A young female worker got anxious, pointed at Chengbao, and said: "You Knot-Making Master, whoever is on the same machine as you is unlucky!..." "Whoever is on the same machine as you won't get a red flag..." Several people were saying Chengbao this and that, when he suddenly shouted: "Go away, go away..." The crowd still didn't leave. He got anxious, ran to the front of the machine, grabbed a handful of waste cotton from the container, and stuffed it into the young girls' apron pockets. The young girls asked: "What's wrong? What's wrong?" He said: "What's wrong, the machine is bullying me, and you're bullying me too, I personally saw you throwing the waste cotton from your pockets into my container, otherwise I wouldn't have so much!" This commotion worked, scaring the young girls, and they screamed and ran back to their own machines.
　　It was time for dinner, that day they were on the night shift, dinner at seven o'clock. Originally, since the machine competition started, group leaders had told everyone to take turns eating, and Chunjie always let Wang Chengbao eat first, watching the machine for him. Today, she was angry with him, and didn't want to let him. Chunjie said: "I'm going to eat first, you watch it for me!" Chengbao said: "Okay!" Chunjie picked up her lunchbox and went to the tea room. There were two large tables there, one table for female workers, one table for male workers, both tables were full. The male workers' table also had their group leader sitting at it. Chunjie ate with everyone, talking about the red flag. Chunjie said angrily: "That Wang Chengbao is a troublemaker, he always eats first, and by the time I eat, there's no one eating anymore, this time I'm angry with him, I'm not letting him." Even though she said that, Chunjie still ate very quickly, and said that she was going to pack up her lunchbox. Other female workers asked her: "You're eating so fast, are you leaving already?" She said: "Yeah, Wang Chengbao is still waiting for me over there!" She went to the boiler to pour water. But when she stood there, she turned her head and saw Wang Chengbao eating at the male workers' table with his head down! Li Chunjie felt a surge of anger and roared:
　　"Wang Chengbao, why are you here too, who's watching our machine?"
　　Wang Chengbao had already heard what Li Chunjie said, but he was suppressing his anger, so at this time he deliberately said slowly: "Don't worry--, there's--someone!"
　　"If someone messes up the machine, what do we do?" As she spoke, she looked at the group leader, "Isn't the group leader here too, if he sees that we're not taking turns eating, he'll definitely mark us down for running off the machine!"
　　"If the machine isn't messed up, who--dares--to--mark--us--down?" He continued to eat slowly as usual.
　　"If the machine isn't messed up, there should be someone at the machine, if the roving manager goes there, they'll definitely say we're running off the machine without releasing it!"
　　"There's--someone, I asked Xianni and Yuexiang to watch it!"
　　When Chunjie heard that Wang Chengbao thought he was right, she got even more anxious, jumping up and down, and threw her lunchbox on the ground with a clang, saying: "Someone!? --I'm taking turns eating with you, not with them!"
　　Wang Chengbao didn't back down either: "What do you care, as long as someone is watching the machine for you, that's all that matters!..."
　　At this point, many male and female workers persuaded them to stop, and Li Chunjie was dragged back to the machine by a roving worker.
　　When Chunjie returned to the machine, she saw that the machine was a mess, and the roving on the roving board hadn't been pushed. She quickly cleaned the machine. Soon after, Chengbao also returned, feeling very angry, really annoyed, and muttered: "Hmph, making me look bad..." Chunjie ignored him, burying her head in cleaning the machine. He kept muttering, making Chunjie so angry that she threw down the flower winding stick and went to find the group leader.
　　"Group leader, you saw what happened just now, I don't want to watch the machine with him anymore!"
　　"Where do you want to go?" The group leader was an honest person, slow and steady, and couldn't say anything to persuade them.
　　"Wherever you're willing to transfer me to, just get me away from him!"
　　"No one else is on strike, so there's no way to transfer you, alas!"
　　Chunjie's little grumbling spirit came over again, saying that even if there was no way to transfer her, she had to be transferred. In the end, the group leader still agreed to "think of a way," and she went back.
　　When Wang Chengbao saw that Chunjie had gone to find the group leader and returned, he thought: "You want to transfer machines, I won't let you!" He was so angry that he ran to the other machine to find the labor union director, Zhang Gong. Zhang Gong and Chengbao were from the same hometown, lived very close, and always went to and from work together. This person also had a straightforward temper, and Chengbao went to find him because he felt close to him and wanted to complain. As for him, he spoke truthfully to Chengbao, feeling familiar and not being afraid of anything.
　　Originally, Chengbao and Zhang Gong usually addressed each other as brothers, but at this time, he didn't know what made Chengbao call him: "Union Director!"
　　Zhang Gong was joining ends, and suddenly looked up. When he saw that it was Chengbao, he said: "What's the matter?" So Chengbao, as if he had reason on his side, told the whole story from beginning to end, no matter how long or short. Finally, he said: "Look, so many people were eating, and she made me look so bad, I can't save my face!"
　　Zhang Gong usually knew that Chengbao wasn't a strong worker. Although he felt that Chunjie's attitude shouldn't have been so bad today, in order to solve the problem, he felt that it was better to pressure Chengbao, so he said bluntly: "Why doesn't she make a scene with Xianni and Yuexiang!? --If you feel like you can't save your face, you should know that you could have gotten a red flag already!..." As he was speaking, the roving whistle suddenly blew, and Zhang Gong didn't give him a chance to argue back, saying: "Go on, it's roving time, don't delay it, I'll talk to Chunjie later!" Chengbao lowered his head and went back.
　　After the roving was finished, Zhang Gong went to Chunjie's machine, saying that Chunjie shouldn't have been so bad-mannered, etc. Chunjie had just calmed down, and when she heard this, she was very unhappy, and started yelling with a pout: "My attitude wasn't good? My attitude wasn't good? What's the point of being a union director! You can't be unreasonable!..." Zhang Gong's quick-talking and straightforwardness had to be turned around again, saying: "I'm not saying your attitude wasn't good, I'm saying you should use your hands more and your mouth less, you should help him join the ends more, sweep the floor more, and move him with practical actions, people's hearts aren't made of iron, even if he doesn't want to think: 'She's a person, and I'm a person too, I'm not missing a piece compared to her, why do I always have to have people help me?'..." Then he will naturally change... When Chunjie heard what the union director said, she thought it was right, if Chengbao was wrong, she should report it to the higher-ups, she shouldn't have lost her temper directly with him, affecting production, so she said: "He's not a good person, but my mouth is too unforgiving..." Zhang Gong said two more sentences before leaving: "I've already talked to Chengbao, just work hard, if he does anything wrong in the future, just come directly to me."

　　　　(III)
　　That day, Zhang Gong didn't say much to Chengbao in the factory, but he said a lot on the way home after work. It was after eleven o'clock at night, the moonlight was bright on the road, and the two of them walked and talked. Chengbao heard Zhang Gong talk about how the Communist Party was different from the Kuomintang, how the Communist Party was the party of the working class, and how working today was working for himself; he heard him talk about how we were oppressed in the past, but today we are the masters; although some of the terms Zhang Gong said sometimes even he didn't understand, Chengbao felt like he understood, even more clearly than the cadres in the classroom. Until he got home, lay in bed, and turned off the lights, Chengbao stared at the window paper that was illuminated by the moon. He had lost his parents early, and was a poor child who gathered firewood and ashes. He started working when he was fourteen. When the Japanese were here, he didn't earn enough to eat, and he couldn't stand the cold in the winter, so he would go to the train to steal some coal in the middle of the night, but he was caught by the Japanese, who poured cold water on him and electrocuted him, detaining him for three months, and several people died. When the Kuomintang came, they dug a large ditch in the middle of his seven acres of land, making it impossible to plant. When the People's Liberation Army came, they leveled the ditch and planted the land again. Now, when he goes to work, if he has difficulties, the union lends him money. When the Kuomintang was here, it was good enough if they paid you the full amount of your salary. At that time, they were only allowed to ask you for money, how could you borrow money from them? After liberation, as soon as he said he wanted to work, he wrote a letter of introduction and went to work; if the Kuomintang was here, even if you said you had skills, you couldn't get in no matter what. Now, working doesn't involve being beaten or scolded, and you can go to school without paying money; in the past, even if you paid money, they wouldn't let poor children go to school! Chengbao thought more and more, thinking about everything that had happened in the past forty years, and no year was as good as this year... If he didn't work hard now, who would he be letting down!?...
　　The next day, Wang Chengbao and Li Chunjie's machine was very different. Although the two of them still didn't talk to each other, both of them put their energy into the machine. --If you don't let me, I won't let you, Chengbao thought: "Don't worry, however many times you tighten the roving shaft, I'll tighten it the same number of times, I'll surpass you if I can tighten it one more time." Chunjie thought: "Hey, even the guy in front of me isn't going to the roving room anymore, and he wants to catch up with me, work harder!" Just like that, the two of them started to compete. Li Chunjie didn't leave the section, and Wang Chengbao didn't leave the section either. Li Chunjie didn't make knots, and Wang Chengbao didn't make knots either. Li Chunjie tightened the roving shaft, and Wang Chengbao tightened the roving shaft too. Li Chunjie fastened the leather roller, and Wang Chengbao fastened the leather roller too. Li Chunjie cleaned it four times, and Wang Chengbao cleaned it five times!...
　　Roving worker Bai Yuhua was even happier when she saw this. She ran to Chengbao's machine and said: "Chengbao, no one dares to say your machine is dirty this time!" Chengbao tightened the leather roller as he said: "Chunjie said I was backward, I have to surpass her clean energy!" She ran to Chunjie's side and said: "Chunjie, Chengbao is competing with you, see if you still say he's not good!" Chunjie tightened the roving shaft as she said: "If I can't suppress his troublemaking energy with my troublemaking energy, I won't be working on this machine!" Machine operator Xianni said: "Chengbao, do you really want to get the red flag?" Chengbao said: "Really want it? --I wish I could grab it right away!" Machine operator Yuexiang asked: "Chengbao, didn't you say only idiots get the red flag?" Chengbao said: "Who said that? --I said only idiots don't get the red flag!..."
　　Ten days later, two red flags were inserted on Li Chunjie and Wang Chengbao's machine, and two red lanterns were hung on their machine.
　　When labor union director Zhang Gong inserted a red flag on Chengbao's machine, Zhang Gong asked: "Chengbao, are you still going to argue with Chunjie?" Chengbao smiled so widely that he couldn't close his mouth: "The bow is bent, but the principle is straight, Chunjie's principle is right, how can I still argue?" When the group leader inserted another red flag on Chunjie's side, the group leader asked: "Chunjie, are you still going to ask to be transferred?" Chunjie smiled, showing her teeth: "You wouldn't transfer me when Chengbao was causing trouble, now that he's a model, there's no need for you to transfer me!" When Chunjie looked at this red flag and then looked at that red flag, when Chengbao looked at that red flag and then looked at this red flag, the eyes of the two people met and blossomed into two flowers--the two people "pfft" and smiled at the same time. At this time, everyone remembered that the two of them hadn't spoken to each other for a whole ten days.
　　At this time, the young female workers who had teased Chunjie and Chengbao earlier also came. When they saw two red flags inserted on the machine head at the same time, they shouted strangely: "Double red flags! Double red flags!" This sentence suddenly reminded Wang Chengbao, and he said: "Hey, everyone, shouldn't I take off the hat of 'Knot-Making Master'?" Xianni抢着说: "Let's call him Double Red Flags, ok?" Li Chunjie also remembered, saying: "Shouldn't my name 'Little Grumbler' be changed too?" Yuexiang said: "Let's change Little Grumbler to Little Model!" Union director Zhang Gong convened a meeting on the spot, saying: "Please raise your hand if you agree!" Everyone laughed and passed it unanimously.

　　双红旗

    　　　　（一）
    王成保和李春姐，两个细纱看车工人，在一个壑啦里看车。
    王成保，男工，四十来岁；解放前有名的捣蛋鬼，外号“练疙疸匠”。那工夫，他能看二十根毛棍。可是一高兴，那二百五劲上来了，就要求当头的，少看五根；当头的要非叫他看二十根，那他也不说别的，就是有劲不使，断了头不接，让它练疙疸去。李春姐，女工，十八岁。也是解放前有名的捣蛋鬼，外号“小磨咕”。那工夫，她那磨咕劲儿上来了，眼看当头的打那边来啦，就地一坐，两手把头一抱。当头的叫她起来，她就说肚子痛；当头的总是磨咕不过她。
    解放以后，厂里运转部改为八小时工作制，不搜腰，不打骂，配卖布匹按八折；工人生活改善了，地位提高了，又常上政治课，讲解共产党和工人的关系，所以许多以前工作捣蛋的工人都靠好处走了，知道今天生产是为了人民为了自己，是为了打倒蒋介石，干的挺有劲儿。李春姐就是这么个人儿。可是也有少数人，不好用脑子，觉悟不够，老毛病不退，好偷个懒。王成保就属这一类。
    李春姐劳动态度转变了，人还是那么尖，好挖苦人，不是说就是唱，嘴老闲不住。所以她跟王成保在一个壑啦里看车，二百五碰见了磨咕精，真是针尖儿对了麦芒儿。
    平常，王成保就好跑车，络一络纱至少有一回跑到毛房去吸烟。碰对了还常旷个工，弄的李春姐就有几分看不上他，可是也不怎么管。到分车竞赛了，李春姐想：“他车上要不好，我这头再干净也得不了红旗。”同时管理员给讲话，说分车竞赛是要团结别人，共同努力；于是春姐干完自己活了，就帮助成保，又是接头，又是勒毛轴。一面就劝成保：“你看分车竞赛啦，咱们得接头快点，少出点白花…………你也少到毛房去吸烟！”王成保说：“吸烟，这是件小事啊？今天死了，就吸了一辈子啦；我老子还不说我呢，你说我！………”他半恼半笑，半真半假。李春姐说：“赶到星期了，人家都插上红旗啦，咱们插不上，多丢人哪！”王成保“清高”的说：“弄那个哩！——哼，都是捉哄傻子的，咱不管快慢，反正一手不闲就算事。”李春姐一听生气了，“你精，我们傻！你不要我要，反正你不能累着我！”成保嬉皮笑脸的说：“我不要，不跟你们小闺女们争那个，把红旗挂到我车上了，你们那么多人得不了，又该气的啼哭啦！”气得春姐就骂他，“哼，真背兴，怎么碰上了你这个二百五！”有时候成保还故意给春姐“送病”（即为难的意思）。那天检查员过来了，成保说：“同志，你看春姐车上多干净啊，赶你往上报动了，报她个模范吧！”春姐说：“你不用说那，人家车都干净的不行，咱车这么脏，名誉多不好哇！”成保说：“名誉好！？——把你家的棉花都拉来，送给厂里，那名誉好，保准还给你登黑板报呢！……”
    “小磨咕”到底不是“练疙疸匠”的对手，春姐惹不了成保，就去找他们那两个看车的女工仙妮和月香去了。因为分车竞赛的组织是四个看车工，两部车一组。比赛条件是出数多、白花少、车上干净、不旷工、不跑车。春姐就跟仙妮和月香商量，春姐说：“咱们合起来跟王成保分家！”仙妮和月香问：“怎么分家？”春姐说：“他净跑毛房，光练疙疸，出白花那么多，咱们跟他分开！”仙妮和月香又问怎么分开，春姐就说咱们把白花分着搁，一个人搁到一个斗里，不跟成保混着，赶约动了也分着约。仙妮月香二人高兴的说：“对，这样也分个清楚明白，谁好谁坏上级也好知道，要不，成天叫他拖着咱们，真干不上劲来，………”结果四人就这样分家了。
    那天他们是下夜班，七点下班，五点约花。组长拿着秤，推着花箱过来了，他们四人都把自己的白花拿出来，搁在车头上。春姐她们三个，每人拳头大的一点，成保那却捏着瓷瓷实实一大团，比个脑袋还大。相比之下，成保不免脸红，心里一动，说：“你们不用约，反正我多，我一个人怎么也看不过你们三个人来，你们那白花净偷着往我斗里扔，愁了我多呀！”说着，急忙把别人的白花带自己的往一起一混，用力一搅，分不清谁是谁的了，结果约了约是一斤半。幸亏春姐眼快手疾，一听成保话头不对，赶紧把自己那一团收起来了，结果约了约是二两。按春姐的两数，仙妮和月香该是四两，那么成保共出了斤四两白花，是不成问题的。仙妮和月香是老实孩子，虽然骂了成保两句，成保不理，也就干吃了哑吧亏。
    到了十天头上，一公布，得上红旗的人不少，可是里面没有成保、春姐、仙妮和月香。当然也还有别的车没得上的。

    春姐一进厂，看见许多车上都插上了红旗。许多红缎子小旗活象许多红灯，照得全厂发亮，照得春姐两眼发花。再往里走，一见自己车上哪，黑咕隆洞的，光看见车头上那大块黑铁板了，什么也没改。这还不算，偏巧有些多事的小女工们，把春姐拉到自己车上，一手扯起插在自己车上的旗角，说：“春姐，你认的吧，你看，这两个白字是模范，模范！”另外过来一个人，伸出右手，四个指头拳着，只小指头向春姐一伸一动，说：“小磨咕，你真是这个呀！”这还不算，另外又有一个人也凑上来趁鼓打雷说：“小磨咕，你磨咕不住练疙疸匠嗳！……”急得春姐从她们的包围里边挣脱出来，不管屁股脑袋叮当噗＠把他们恨恨的擂了几捶，一边骂着：“小死丫头子，小死丫头子们……”逃到自己车上去了。
    李春姐好不生气，自不必说。只见她闷头在那接头，越接越气。她想：咱一天连水也顾不上喝，饭也顾不上吃，有时候拉了警报也不跑，一心为了出数多，车干净。自己车接好了还帮他，他竟这么不知好歹……车上插不上红旗，显着自己多落后哇？………想着想着，接不下头去了，就找到帮她车的络纱工白玉花去说：“玉花姐，咱们这么成天不离车，两眼死盯着车，恨不得把车看个窟隆，费多大心哪，跟他被这个伤，我要求组长调车呀！……”落纱工白玉花安慰了她几句，趁大家都把头接好了，把成保、仙妮，同月香、春姐拉到一起，开了个小会，劝成保加油，劝大家团结；最后鼓励大家说：“以后我落完纱了，更多帮你们接头、清洁车，这回咱没插上红旗，看下回！”开会以后，成保活象心里有点不服，可也没有说出口来，又去接头。过了一会，刚才给春姐调皮的那几个小闺女见他们开会了，又喜眉带笑的到春姐车上来了。这回来不是找春姐的帐，是向成保来的。他们逗成保：“开什么会啦？”成保横了横脖，看不起她们的样子，又去接头。一个小女工急了，指着成保说：“你这个练疙疸匠，谁给你在一个车上谁倒霉！……”“谁跟你在一个车上谁得不了红旗……”几个人正你一嘴我一舌的说成保，他忽然嚷嚷起来：“走吧，走吧……”大家还不走。他急了，跑到车头前，把斗里的白花抓了一把就往小闺女们围腰兜里塞，小闺女们问：“怎么啦？怎么啦？”他说：“怎么啦，车欺侮我吧，你们还欺侮我，我亲自眼见你们把你们兜里的白花扔到我斗啦，要不我就这么多呀！”这一闹可灵验，吓的小闺女们哇哇乱叫，回到自己车上去了。
    开饭时间到了，这一天他们是上夜班，七点开饭。本来，自从开始分车竞赛，组长们对大家说要轮流吃饭以来，春姐总是让王成保先吃，自己替他看车。这一天心里生他的气，不想让他了。春姐说：“我先吃饭去啦，你替我看着点！”成保说：“行！”春姐提上饭盒就到茶炉房来了。这里有两张大桌子，一个桌上是女工，一个桌上是男工，两个桌都坐的满满的。男工桌上还坐着他们组长。春姐跟大家一块吃着，一边念道，大家都谈着挂红旗的事情。春姐气呼呼的说：“王成保这家伙可捣蛋哩，每回吃饭都是他吃到头里，赶我吃饭都是没人吃啦，这回跟他生气啦，我不让他啦。”虽然这么说，春姐还是吃的很快，说着就收拾饭盒子。别的女工问她：“吃的真快，可就走哇？”她说：“嗯，人家王成保还在那等着呢！”一面到锅炉那去倒水。可是当她靠那一立，一回头，见王成保正在男工桌上低着头吃呢！李春姐不禁一阵火上心头，大吼起来：
    “王成保，怎么你也来啦，谁给咱看车哪？”
    刚才李春姐的话本来都叫王成保听见了，只是压着那火劲儿没着起来就是了，所以这会儿他故意慢条斯理的说：“不要着急——，有——人！”
    “有人问——给咱练了疙疸怎么办？”说着一面看看组长，“这不是组长也在这里，见咱们不轮班吃饭，保险得给画跑车号！”
    “不练疙疸，谁——敢——画——呀？”他照常是慢条斯理的吃着。
    “不练疙疸，车上也该有人，要没人，落纱长去了，非说咱们跑车不解！”
    “有——人，我叫仙妮跟月香看着哩！”
    春姐一听，王成保觉着自己还有理似的，更急了，跳着脚，把饭盒往地上当啷一丢，说：“有人！？——我是跟你倒班吃饭的，又不是跟人家！”
    王成保也一点不示弱：“你管那，反正有人给你看车就行啦！……”
    到这里，许多男工女工把他们劝开了，李春姐被一个落纱的拖回车上去了。
    春姐回到车上一看，车上乱七八糟，毛板上的花也没线推，她就赶紧清洁车。随后成保也回去了，气大的不行，真恼了，一面嘟哝着：“哼，给我闹这个难看……”春姐不答理他，闷着头清洁车。他还是嘟哝，气得春姐把绞花棍一扔，找组长去了。
    “组长，刚才闹的事你也看见啦，我不愿跟他一块看车啦！”
    “你愿意在那？”组长是个老实人，慢不腾的，也说不上什么劝解的话来。
    “你愿拨到我那拨到我那，反正离开他！”
    “别人没歇工的，也没法调，唉！”
    春姐那小磨咕劲又上来了，说没法调也得调，结果组长还是答应“想办法就是”，她才回去。
    王成保见春姐找组长去回来了，想：“你想调车，我还不干哪！”一股暗气不出，他跑到对车上找分工会主任张功去了。张功跟成保是老乡，住的很靠近，成天上班来下班去一块走，这个人也是个炮筒子脾气，直心眼子，成保找他去，是觉着亲近，想诉诉苦。而他对成保呢，是个说直理，觉着熟和，不忌讳什么。
    本来平常成保和张功是你兄我弟的来往称呼，到这会儿也不知道一股子什么劲使成保叫了他一声：“分会主任！”
    张功正接头，忽的抬起头来，一看是成保，说：“什么事？”于是成保得住理了似的，从头到尾，怎长怎短，说了个一清二楚。最后说：“你看那么多人吃饭，他跟我闹那么大难看，叫我脸上多挂不住哇！”
    张功平常知道成保干活不强，虽然他觉着今天这事情，春姐态度也不该那么不好，可是为了好解决问题　他觉着压成保一下比较好，所以直截了当的说：“她怎么不跟仙妮、月香闹难看哪！？——你觉着脸上挂不住，你要知道难看，你早挂上红旗啦！……”正说着，那边忽然吹起络纱哨了，张功没有给他还手之工，就说：“去吧，络纱啦，别耽误着啦，我一会儿说说春姐去！”成保也就低头搭脑袋的回来了。
    这一络纱络完了，张功到春姐车上去，说春姐不该态度那么不好等等；春姐本来刚消了气，一听这话好不在行，又噘着嘴叫唤起来了：“我那儿态度不好？我那儿态度不好？你当分会主任怎么样啊！也不能不讲理！………”闹得张功这口快心直劲儿也不得不又拐回来，说：“不是说你态度不好，我是说你该多用手，少用嘴，你多帮他接头，多扫地，多拿实际行动感动他，人心又不是铁打的，那怕他不想想：“人家是人，我也是人，那儿也不比人家少一块儿，为什么老叫人家帮助我呢？……”那他自然就会转变啦……春姐一听分会主任说的也是，成保有错该给上级报告，也不该直接对他发脾气，影响生产哪，就说：“他这个人不好是不好，可是我的嘴也太不吃亏啦………。”张功临走还说了两句：“我已经把成保说好啦，你就好好干吧，以后他有什么不好，你就直接找我。”

    当天张功在厂里对成保说话不多，可是下班在回家道儿上可说话不少。夜里十一点以后，马路上明光的月亮地，两个人一面走一面说。成保听张功讲共产党跟国民党不一样，共产党是工人阶级的党，今天作活是为自己作；听他讲过去咱们怎样受压迫，今天却作了主人；虽然张功说的一些名词有时连他自己也不大懂，但成保却象听懂了，比干部在课堂讲的还明白。直到回到家里，躺在床上，熄了灯，成保盯着月亮照得刹白的窗纸还在想。自个儿从小爹娘死的早，是个拾柴搂火的穷孩子。打十四上就上工。日本在时挣的不够吃，冬天冻的受不了，半夜到火车上去偷点煤，叫日本人给逮住了，又灌凉水又上电刑，扣了三个月，死了几个死。国民党来了，把家里七亩地中间挑了一道大沟，不能养种。解放军来了，平了沟，又种上了地。现在上工，自己有了困难，工会里借给钱。国民党在时候，工资给你开够数目就是好的。那工夫只许人家朝你要你那能朝人家借？解放以后，自己一说要干，写上个介绍信就上班了；要国民党在时呢，你天说有手艺，没门子死也不沾。现在作工不挨打，不挨骂，不花钱叫上学；过去就是你掏钱也不叫你穷小子上啊！……成保越想越多，四十年的事情都想到了，那一年也没有今年好……，现在再不好好干，对得起谁！？………
    第二天一上班，王成保和李春姐车上可大不一样了。虽然两个人还是你不答理我，我不答理你，可是两人的别扭劲都用到车上来了。——你不让我，我不让你，成保心想：“不用着急，你勒几回毛轴我也勒几回，我能多勒一回就超过你一回。”春姐心想：“嘿，看俺前头的也不上毛房啦，还要把我赶上了哩，加油干！”就这样两个人赛开了。李春姐不出壑啦，王成保也不出壑啦。李春姐不练疙疸，王成保也不练疙疸。李春姐勒毛轴，王成保也勒毛轴。李春姐扣皮滚，王成保也扣皮滚。李春姐清洁四回，王成保清洁五回！……。
    络纱工白玉花看了更高兴。她跑到成保车上，说：“成保，这回可谁也不敢说你车脏啦！”成保一面扣着皮滚说：“春姐说我落后，我非把她那干净劲儿盖下去不行！”她跑到春姐这头说：“春姐，成保给你赛开啦，看你还说人家不！”春姐一面勒着毛轴说：“我这个捣蛋劲儿，要不把他这个捣蛋劲压下去，就不在这儿看车啦！”看车工仙妮说：“成保，你真想得红旗啦？”成保说：“真想得？——恨不得一下子拿过来！”看车工月香问：“成保，你不是说傻子才得红旗呀？”成保说：“谁那么说呀？——我说傻子才不得红旗！……”
    十天以后，两个红旗插在了李春姐和王成保的车上，两个红灯挂在了他们车上。
    当分会主任张功把一个红旗插在成保车上时，张功问：“成保你还跟春姐吵架吧？”成保笑的合不上嘴：“弓是弯的，理是直的，春姐的理对，咱还能抬杠？”当组长把另一个红旗插在春姐这边时，组长问：“春姐，还要求调车吧？”春姐笑的露着牙：“成保捣蛋的时候你不调，人家成了模范啦，现在用不着你调啦！”当春姐看看这个红旗又看看那个红旗，当成保看看那个红旗又看看这个红旗，两个人的眼光碰到一块儿开了两朵花——两个人“喷儿”一口同时笑了。这时候，大家才记起来，原来他们两个已别了整十天不说话了。
    这时候，那几个原先抢白春姐和成保的小女工也来了，一看两个红旗同时插在车头上，奇怪的喊：“双红旗！双红旗！”这句话忽然提醒了王成保，他说：“哎，众位，我这个练疙疸匠的帽子该摘了吧？”仙妮抢着说：“就叫个双红旗吧？”李春姐也想起来了，说：“我这小磨咕的名字也该换了吧？”月香抢着说：“小磨咕就改小模范吧！”分会主任张功当场召集开会说：“请同意的举手！”大家哈哈大笑，全数通过。
