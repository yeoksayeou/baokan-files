　　SED Congress Calls for Establishment of an All-German Democratic Government

    【Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 2nd】The German Socialist Unity Party (SED) Congress, which opened on January 25th, closed on the 28th. According to TASS: The conference passed a declaration sharply condemning the placement of West German industry under the control of American imperialists, and the so-called "Ruhr Statute" aimed at opposing the development of an independent, self-sufficient, peaceful German economy. The declaration stated: The "Occupation Statute" that imperialist countries are trying to impose on the German people stipulates that the West German occupation zone will remain under military dictatorship for the next few decades. The declaration continued: The US-British policy in Germany not only threatens the German people, but also all the people of Europe. West Germany, a colonial country, will become the center of a Western European military alliance, which American imperialism wants to use to implement its plan to dominate Europe and the world. The declaration then pointed out the traitorous role of those West German politicians who support American imperialist dictatorship. The declaration pointed out the new situation in East Germany. There, highly important democratic reforms—land reform, the transfer of war criminal factories to the people—have been implemented, and an independent peaceful policy is developing steadily. The declaration stated: The epoch-making task of organizing and leading the national movement for unification and national salvation has fallen on the shoulders of the working class, headed by the German Socialist Unity Party. In conclusion, the declaration called for the establishment of an all-German democratic government, the restoration of Germany's political and economic unity, the abolition of the Ruhr Control Authority and the incorporation of the Ruhr into a unified democratic Germany, the completion of democratic land reform and the expropriation of the property of war criminals and Nazi criminals throughout Germany, the conclusion of a democratic peace by the German government, and the withdrawal of all occupying forces after the peace treaty is signed. The declaration of the First Congress of the German Socialist Unity Party calls on the German people to fight for unity and a just peace, against the imperialist policy of splitting and enslaving Germany, to participate in the democratic peace camp, and to fight against the camp of reaction and war.

　　德统一社会党代表会号召
  　建立全德民主政府
    【新华社陕北二日电】一月二十五日开幕的德国统一社会党代表会议，已于二十八日闭幕。据塔斯社讯：会议通过宣言，尖锐斥责把西德工业置于美国帝国主义者控制之下，和旨在反对独立的、能够自谋生存的德国和平经济之发展的所谓“鲁尔法规”。宣言声称：帝国主义国家正试图强加于德国人民的“占领法规”，规定了将西德占领区今后数十年均处于军事独裁之下。宣言继称：美英在德政策不仅威胁德国人民，而且也威胁欧洲的一切人民。西德殖民国家将成为西欧军事联盟的中心，美国帝国主义想借助于这个联盟，以实行其统治欧洲和独霸世界的计划。宣言继指出那些支持美国的帝国主义独裁的西德政客们的卖国作用。宣言指出东德的崭新情况。在那里，高度重要的民主改革——土地改革、战争罪犯工厂的转交给人民——已经实施，独立的和平政策正稳定地发展着。宣言声称：组织与领导争取统一和救国的全国运动的划时代的任务，已落到了以德国统一社会党为首的工人阶级肩上。宣言在结语中要求建立全德民主政府，恢复德国政治上和经济上的统一，废除鲁尔噜制局并把鲁尔并入统一的民主德国，把民主土地改革和剥夺军事罪犯与纳粹罪犯的财产在全德国进行到底，由德国政府归结民主和平，并在和约签字后撤退所有占领军队等。德国统一社会党第一次代表会议宣言，号召德国人民为争取统一与公正和平和反对分裂与奴役德国的帝国主义政策而奋斗，为参加民主和平阵营和为反对反动与战争阵营而奋斗。
