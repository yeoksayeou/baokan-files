    【Taihang Urgent Telegram】The People's Liberation Army on the Yubei front liberated the isolated stronghold of Huixian City, northwest of Xinxiang, on the morning of the 4th. Over a thousand enemy troops surrendered completely. Our army launched an attack on the enemy entrenched in Huixian City at dawn on the 2nd, and completely occupied the east, west, and south passes of the city by 2:00 PM. The enemy shrank back into the city. In order to protect the lives and property of the people in the city from being ravaged by artillery fire, our army issued a notice to the enemy troops in the city that night, ordering them to surrender and hand over their weapons, otherwise they would be completely annihilated. Under the pressure of our mighty army, more than a thousand men of the puppet Huixian Security Corps, led by Zhao Yansheng, Yang Yiqing, and Chen Juting, the chief and deputy chiefs, laid down their arms and surrendered to us on the morning of the 4th. At this point, the Kuomintang bandit troops remaining in the two strongholds of Xinxiang and Anyang in northern Henan were even more isolated.

    【Taihang Telegram】(Delayed) The Kuomintang bandit troops entrenched in the isolated island of Xinxiang in northern Henan were annihilated by our army with over two thousand eight hundred casualties while invading to seize grain. On the 21st of last month, the Xinxiang Kuomintang bandit troops pieced together their remnants, totaling more than five thousand men, and launched an attack towards the Wu'antun, Dongxitun, and Liyuantun areas southeast of Jixian and northwest of Yanjin to seize grain. A certain unit of the People's Liberation Army, in a swift action, advanced and encircled them by different routes overnight, first annihilating more than three hundred enemy troops in Dongxitun. Subsequently, on the 25th, the Kuomintang bandit troops of the 316th Regiment of the 40th Army, the 9th and 14th Artillery Regiments, and the 2nd Supply Regiment of the bandit Ministry of National Defense, totaling two thousand five hundred men, who had fled to the Weihe Bay, more than ten miles west of Daokou and north of Huaxian, were completely surrounded. After our army annihilated one battalion of the enemy, the remaining enemy, under the pressure of our large encirclement, all surrendered to us. The other remnant bandits fled in panic. In total, over two thousand eight hundred enemy troops were annihilated, and two chemical mortars, four 82mm mortars, sixteen 60mm mortars, ten grenade launchers, one hundred and thirty-two light and heavy machine guns, one thousand two hundred and sixty-five long and short rifles, and other military supplies were seized.
