    Ireland – Located in Western Europe, on a small island in the Atlantic Ocean. The northern part of this island, Northern Ireland, is joined with the island of Great Britain to form the British mainland; the southwestern part of the island is the Irish Free State, with an area of 68,860 square kilometers and a population of 2.95 million (1943 statistics), with its capital in Dublin. The main products are grains, wool, and other industries, with flour mills being the most developed. Before the establishment of the Irish Free State, it was also part of the British mainland. In April 1916, the people launched their first uprising and established a republic. From 1919 to 1921, as a result of continuous struggles with Britain, the British Parliament recognized it as a British dominion and officially called it the Irish Free State. In 1937, it was renamed Ireland. The Irish people's heroic struggle for independence is admirable; however, the majority of Ireland's leaders are reactionary. Therefore, the people of Ireland continue to live under fascist oppression.

    爱尔兰——在欧洲西部，位于大西洋里的一个小岛上。这个岛的北部，北爱尔兰与大不列巅岛合在一起，构成英国的本土；岛的西南部为爱尔兰自由邦，面积六万八千八百六十方公里，人口二百九十五万（一九四三年统计），首都在都伯林。主要出产是麦类、羊毛等工业，以制面厂为最发达。爱尔兰自治邦未建立前，也是英国本土的一部分。一九一六年四月人民第一次起义，建立了共和国，一九一九到一九二一年之间，不断与英国斗争的结果，英国国会才承认了它为英国的一个自治领，并正式称为爱尔兰自由邦。一九三七年仍改称为爱尔兰。爱尔兰人民这种英勇斗争，要求独立的精神是极可敬佩的；但爱尔兰的领导人物，多数却是反动的。所以，爱尔兰的人民一直还是生活在法西斯压迫之下。
