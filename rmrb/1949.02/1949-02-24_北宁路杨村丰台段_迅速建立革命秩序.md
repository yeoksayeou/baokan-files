(Jizhong Electric) The Yangcun-Fengtai section of the Northern Beiping Railway, during the period of military control, relied on workers to restore various constructions and achieved considerable success, with revolutionary order being rapidly established. On December 14th of last year, Langfang was liberated, and on the 20th, the Yangcun-Fengtai Section Military Control Commission was formally established. Under the direct leadership of the Jizhong Tenth District Committee, it successively took over the Yangcun, Huangtupo, Huangcun, Weishanzhuang, Anding, Wanzhuang, and Langfang stations. The Northern Beiping Railway, Yangcun-Fengtai section, officially opened to traffic on the sixth day after the takeover. At the same time, telephone lines to the front and rear were also unblocked, and electricity was supplied to Langfang and Facun around the Lunar New Year. More than 870 workers in the engineering, electrical, and railway departments resumed work, accounting for more than 85% of the original workers. Thanks to the workers' enthusiastic guarding, all transportation materials were intact. Regarding the takeover of enemy materials: a total of more than 174,000 catties of grain such as corn and wheat, more than 120,000 catties of cotton, 298 bolts of cloth, 52 various machines, 275 rifles and carbines, and 15 machine guns were confiscated. In terms of national education: there are 27 schools in the Yangcun-Fengtai section, which resumed classes around the 24th of last month, with 2,691 students currently. In terms of municipal administration: most industrial and commercial businesses have begun operations. Out of 157 industrial and commercial households in Langfang, 117 have resumed business and established organizations such as the Chamber of Commerce and the Hawker's Union. The achievements of this section of work mainly relied on the workers, strengthening the workers' class education, and raising their political awareness. When we first took over the Yangcun-Fengtai section, some workers, deceived by the enemy for a long time, did not understand our party's policies for a while and went home. However, after political education and situation education, the workers immediately became active, carrying cold pancakes to inspect roads and repair lines, enabling the rapid restoration of railway and telephone traffic.

　　北宁路杨村丰台段
  　迅速建立革命秩序
    【冀中电】北宁铁路杨村至丰台段，军管期中依靠工人恢复各种建设，获得相当成绩，革命秩序迅速建立。去年十二月十四日廊坊解放，二十日杨丰段军管会正式成立。在冀中十地委的直接领导下，先后接管了杨村、黄土坡、黄村、魏善庄、安定、万庄、廊坊等车站。北宁路杨丰段于接收的第六天即正式通车，同时前后方的电话也畅通了，廊坊、垡村的电灯也在旧历年前后开始送电。工务、电务、铁路等工人八百七十多名，复工者占原有工人的百分之八十五强。由于工人的热心看管，一切交通器材均完好无损。在接管敌人物资方面：共收缴玉米、小麦等粮食十七万四千多斤，棉花十二万多斤，布二百九十八匹，各种机器五十二架，长短枪二百七十五支，机枪十五挺。在国民教育方面：杨丰段共有学校二十七处，已于上月二十四日前后复课，现有学生二千六百九十一名。在市政方面：工商业已大部开始营业。廊坊一百五十七户工商业，已有一百十七户复业并建立了商会、摊贩工会等组织。这一段工作的成就，主要是依靠了工人，加强工人的阶级教育，提高了政治觉悟。在我们刚接管杨丰段时，有些工人因长期被敌人欺骗，一时不了解我党政策而躲回家去。但经过政治教育和形势教育以后，工人们立即积极起来，工人们怀里揣着凉饼子去查道、修线，使铁路电话交通很快得到恢复。
