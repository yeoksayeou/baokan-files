Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 14th. Even news agencies like United Press, which serve American imperialism, are now forced to report, with regret, the actual situation of the Kuomintang reactionaries—once and still heavily supported by the American government—falling apart and collapsing. Below is one of their recent reports. We reproduce this report verbatim as follows:

　　“United Press, Nanjing, 12th (Shanghai Branch, received at 17:20 and sent at 18:00): Zhang Guoxing reports: The Chinese government is now scattered throughout China. Nanjing and Guangzhou are engaged in a tug-of-war, trying to bring this government together in one place. Many observers are beginning to say that until the process of unification succeeds, this government can be considered to have completely lost its integrity, existing only in name. On the surface, there are no serious divisions in policy, despite the institutional divisions; but internally, there is an undercurrent of psychological conspiracy. According to the constitution, the government consists of the President, the Executive Yuan, the Legislative Yuan, the Control Yuan, the Judicial Yuan, and the Examination Yuan. The following is the situation of the scattered government departments: First, the President—now in Nanjing, hoping that the Executive Yuan will also return here. Second, the Executive Yuan—now in Guangzhou, also hoping that the President will go there. Third, the Legislative Yuan—has not yet decided where to go. Its secretariat staff is partly here, partly in Guangzhou, and partly traveling in several places in China. Legislators are scattered in Nanjing, Shanghai, Hangzhou, Hankou, Guilin, Taiwan, and Guangzhou, arguing about where to go. According to the Central News Agency, the Guangzhou secretariat of the Legislative Yuan announced that the next meeting of the Legislative Yuan will be held there. Its secretariat here notified its staff that the meeting will be held in Nanjing. Fourth, the Control Yuan—is in the same situation as the Legislative Yuan. Fifth, the Examination Yuan and the Judicial Yuan—they are physically forgotten limbs. No one knows where they are or where to find them. Examination Yuan President Zhang Boling is now on vacation in Chongqing, and Judicial Yuan President Wang Longhui is somewhere in southern China, probably in Guangzhou. In Nanjing, you will hear more about peace and find a more optimistic official attitude, and read news of the imminent return of the cabinet. News from Guangzhou newspapers talks more about war and says that Acting President Li Zongren is about to go there. The four government peace representatives should gather in one place to discuss their difficult mission, but they are also scattered everywhere. Shao Lizi is now in Shanghai and will leave for Peiping tomorrow; Huang Shao＠ is making an indefinite stay in Shanghai; Zhang Zhizhong is in Lanzhou, also making an indefinite stay; Zhong Tianxin is in Guangzhou. People describe this as chaos upon chaos. If a formal response from the government to the Communist Party's broadcasts is required, what will happen? The answer is: Li Zongren will have to discuss the drafting of the reply with the cabinet in Guangzhou and the peace representatives in Shanghai and Lanzhou by telegram or long-distance telephone. If a new ambassador arrives, what will happen? The answer is: He must first go to Guangzhou to see the Foreign Minister, and then return to Nanjing to present his credentials."

　　美帝极力支持也不顶事
  　匪政府机构四分五裂
    合众社记者用惋惜的笔调报导
    【新华社陕北十四日电】象合众社这样替美国帝国主义服务的通讯社，现在，对于被美国政府所曾经极力支持而且现仍极力支持的国民党反动派，亦不得不在惋惜这笔调下报导其四分五裂，土崩瓦解的实际情况。下面就是它最近的一篇报导。现将这篇报导一字不易地转录如下：“合众社南京十二日电（上海分社十七时二十分到十八时发）：张国兴报导：中国政府今日分散在中国各地，南京与广州则进行拉锯战，图使这政府合在一个地方。许多观察家正开始说，在合并的过程成功以前，这一政府可以被认为已完全失去其完整性，仅有一个名义。外表上看，政策上并无严重分裂，尽管机构分裂；但内里，却有一股心理上阴谋的暗流。按照宪法，政府由总统、行政院、立法院、监察院、司法院及考试院组成。下面就是政府各部门分散的情形：第一、总统——现在南京，渴望行政院也返回此间。第二、行政院——现在广州。也渴望总统前赴该地。第三、立法院——尚未决定到何处去。其秘书处人员部分在此间，部分在广州，部分在中国若干地方旅行。立法委员们分散在南京、上海、杭州、汉口、桂林、台湾及广州，互相争吵到何处去。据中央社称，广州的立院秘书处宣布，立院下次会议将在该地举行。其在此间的秘书处则通知其人员称，会议将在南京召开。第四、监察院——和立法院处在一样的情况中。第五、考试院及司法院——它们是躯体上被遗忘的肢体。无人知道它们在何处，或何处可找到他们。考试院长张伯苓现在重庆休假，司法院长王龙惠现在华南某地，大概是在广州。在南京，你将听到较多关于和平的事情，并发现官方态度较乐观，并读到内阁即将返来的消息。来自广州的报纸消息更多地谈到战争，并称，代总统李宗仁即将前赴该地。四位政府的和平代表照理应聚在一个地方讨论他们的困难的使命，但他们也散在各地。邵力子现在上海，将于明日启程赴平；黄绍＠现在上海作不定期的逗留；张治中在兰州，也在作不定期的逗留；钟天心则在广州。人们描述这是乱上加乱。如果需要政府对共产党的广播作正式的答复，那么会发生什么事情呢？答案如下：李宗仁将必须以电报或长途电话与广州的内阁和上海与兰州的和平代表讨论复文的起草。如果一个新大使到来，会发生什么事情呢？答案是：他必须先赴广州见外长，然后再返回南京向代表呈递国书。”
