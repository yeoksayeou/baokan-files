    Labor Hero Zhao Meiying
    ——Introduction to Delegates Attending the National Women's Congress
    Zhao Meiying, a female labor hero from Fushan who participated in this Taiyue District Women's Congress, was elected as a member of the district women's federation and a delegate to the National and North China Women's Congresses.

    Zhao Meiying is thirty-seven years old this year. Her ancestral home is Heze County, Shandong. She participated in labor from a young age. In the twenty-fourth year of the Republic of China, she and her husband, Hou Yusheng, and her brother fled to the mountains due to famine. In Xiaoxizhuang, Fancun, Second District of Fushan, they rented five mu of land from a landlord, and had to pay six shi of rent each year. Because they couldn't make ends meet, her husband went out begging for food, and she and her brother reclaimed wasteland at home. In half a year, they reclaimed more than thirty mu of wasteland; however, under the exploitation of the landlord, they still had no food or clothing, eating bran and wild apricots every day, which caused her nose to bleed frequently. They were so poor that the three of them took turns wearing a single pair of pants when going out. They lived such a painful life for ten years.

    Fushan was liberated, and Comrade Meiying was also liberated. During the turn-over movement, she was allocated twenty mu of land and two cave dwellings. Comrade Meiying joined the Communist Party of China. Under the constant education of the Party, she realized that if women want to improve their status in the family and society, they must actively participate in labor and production. During the spring plowing season, she and five women, including military dependents Li Xiuhua and Zhang Xiuhua, formed a group to cut firewood in the mountains, which solved the problem of firewood shortage during the spring plowing season. Later, they proposed mutual aid in hoeing, but the men looked down on them, saying that they were "fooling around and it wouldn't work." They patiently learned in their own fields first, hoeing fifteen mu in two days. As a result, the men also changed their attitude. Meiying's group expanded to ten people, and they hoed a total of more than ninety mu of land. The women in the back mountain held Meiying's hands and said, "The women's mutual aid in your area is good. We also want to organize, but there is no one to lead." Meiying knew that Li Fenghua was an oppressed woman, so she personally went to mobilize her, saying, "I have participated in labor, and now I am no longer angry with my brother. If you can lead women in production, I guarantee that your brother and sister-in-law will no longer look down on you." The next day, the women in the back mountain also organized a mutual aid group, which developed to sixteen people in a few days. Her brother and sister-in-law, who used to not let Li Fenghua eat her fill, also became good to her. Li Fenghua happily said to Zhao Meiying, "It was really you who helped me liberate." Similarly, Deng Peilan's husband originally wanted to divorce her, but since Deng Peilan joined the mutual aid group, she was able to work and was filial to her parents, and the whole family said, "If we divorce, where can we find such a good daughter-in-law?" Her husband also became good to her. Meiying further organized the women in the whole village, organizing a total of thirty-three groups, with one hundred and thirty-seven people, and was able to solve problems in a timely manner and consolidate the mutual aid groups. For example, last year, some mutual aid groups were unable to continue due to some problems. Under Meiying's leadership and rectification, they were re-consolidated. For example, Fa'e, the leader of the Liu Lü mutual aid group, had a bad work style. Meiying led everyone to re-elect the leader democratically; Zhang Xiuying's group's accounts were unclear, and Meiying urged everyone to calculate accounts diligently, and also stipulated the method of "doing work according to the quality and speed, reasonably calculating work points, making shoes for men counts as five work points, and making a pair of socks counts as three work points." As a result, everyone worked even harder. Last spring, when the men went to Linfen to participate in the war, the women carried 9,250 loads of manure. The women hoed two-thirds of the more than 5,000 mu of autumn land in the village, enabling 116 women to learn how to hoe and 23 women to learn how to farm. In addition, 234 women in the village were organized to participate in the textile group. The year before last, the whole village spun a total of 1,060 jin of thread. In terms of supporting the war, during the Linfen Campaign last year, her village had to send thirty-two shi of public grain to the front line. If only men went to deliver it, it would take twenty days. Zhao Meiying led the women to participate, and the task was completed in ten days. They also washed 1,070 pieces of clothing for the troops, made 1,056 pairs of pants, and made 200 quilts.

    Under the leadership of Comrade Meiying, since the women of Fancun participated in various production and support-the-front work, their status in the family and society has been greatly improved. The women's level of awareness is also improving day by day. Comrade Meiying's prestige is also increasing day by day. Once Meiying was ill, the whole village cared about her health. The house was filled with visitors every day, and just eggs, pears, and steamed buns were sent in four or five large baskets. The comrades from the village's state-owned store and the troops were also busy asking doctors to treat her illness. Comrade Zhao Meiying said, "I will never forget the Communist Party, and I will never forget the masses. As long as I live, I will serve the Party and the masses to the end. I also want to lead the women's work in the whole county well."

　　劳动英雄赵梅英
    ——出席全国妇女代表大会代表介绍
    参加这次太岳区妇女代表大会的浮山女劳动英雄赵梅英同志，当选了全区妇联会的委员，和出席全国和华北妇女代表会的代表。
    赵梅英今年三十七岁，老家是山东菏泽县，从小就参加劳动。民国二十四年，她跟男人侯玉生和兄弟逃荒到了山区，在浮山二区范村的小西庄上租种了地主五亩地，每年得出六石租。因为顾不住生活，男人出去要饭，她跟兄弟在家开荒。半年工夫开了三十多亩荒地；可是在地主剥削底下，还是没吃没穿，天天吃糠咽菜，吃山杏吃的鼻子常流血，穷的三口人出门轮流穿一条裤子。这样痛苦的生活，一直过了十年。
    浮山解放了，梅英同志也跟着解放了。翻身运动中分到二十亩地，两孔窑。梅英同志参加了中国共产党。在党的不断教育底下认识到妇女要想提高自己在家庭和社会的地位，非积极参加劳动生产不行。在春耕时候，就跟军属李秀花、张秀花等五个妇女组织成一个小组，上山砍柴，解决了春耕期间烧柴的困难。后来又提出互助锄地，但男人们看不起她们，说是“瞎糊闹不顶事”。她们先在自己地里耐心学习，两天锄了十五亩。这样一来，男人也改变了态度。梅英的组扩大到十个人，一共锄了九十多亩地。后山妇女们拉着梅英的手说：“你们那里妇女互助好，我们也想组织，就是没人领导。”梅英知道李凤花是受压迫的妇女，就亲自去动员她说：“我参加了劳动，现在再不受兄弟的气了，你能领导起妇女生产，保险你哥嫂再不敢小看你。”第二天后山妇女也组织起了互助组，不上几天发展到十六个人。过去不让李凤花吃饱的哥嫂，也对她好起来了。李凤花高兴地对赵梅英说：“真是你帮助我解放了。”又如邓配兰的男人原来要和她离婚，但自邓配兰参加了互助组以后，能劳动又孝顺父母，全家人都说：“离了婚，再到那里找这样好的媳妇去？”她男人也和她好了。梅英又进一步的组织了全村妇女，一共组织起三十三个组，有一百三十七个人，并且能及时解决问题，巩固互助组。如去年有些互助组，因为有些问题闹不下去了，在梅英领导整顿下，又重新巩固起来。象六闾互助组组长发娥作风不好，梅英领导大家重新民主选举了组长；张秀英组帐目不清，梅英督促大家勤算帐，还规定了“做活按好坏快慢，合理计工，给男人做鞋以对顶五个工，做袜子一双顶三个工”的办法。这样一来，大家干的更起劲了。去年春天男人们都到临汾参战走了，妇女们就担了九千二百五十担粪，全村五千多亩秋地，妇女就锄了三分之二，使一百一十六个妇女学会了锄地，二十三个妇女学会了种地。此外还组织了全村二百三十四个妇女参加了纺织组。前年全村一共纺了一千零六十斤线。在支援战争上，去年临汾战役，她村要往前方送公粮三十二石，要是光男人去送，就得二十天，赵梅英领导着妇女参加，结果十天就完成了任务。还给部队洗衣一千零七十件，做裤一千零五十六条，做被子二百条。
    范村妇女在梅英同志领导下，自从参加了各种生产和支援前线的工作以后，在家庭和社会上的地位大大提高了。妇女们的觉悟程度也一天比一天提高。梅英同志的威信也是一天一天的提高。一次梅英病了，全村人都关心着她的健康，房子里一天挤满了探望的人，光鸡蛋、梨、馍馍就送了四五大筐；驻村公营商店和部队上的同志们也都忙着给她请医生治病。赵梅英同志说：“我忘不了共产党，忘不了群众，活一天总要为党为群众服务到底。我还要把全县的妇女工作也领导好。”
