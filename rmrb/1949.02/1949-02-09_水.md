　　Water
    The human body needs water, and a lack of water will affect health. Therefore, drinking soup and water is indispensable in our daily life.
    Due to different conditions in various places, some people drink well water or spring water; some drink river water; and some even drink pit water. However, these waters contain more or less germs or dirt, which can easily cause illness if consumed. If we want to get sick less often, we should pay attention to the hygiene of drinking water.
    How do we pay attention to the hygiene of drinking water?
    In places with wells, the wells can be dug deeper, because the deeper the well, the fewer impurities in the water. To keep well water clean: build a well platform to make the well higher than the ground. Add a cover to the well opening, keep the water-drawing utensils clean, and keep dirty water pits and manure piles away from the well. In general, spring water should be selected from places facing the sun, and the spring opening should be surrounded by walls and covered to prevent dirty water from flowing in.
    Villages that drink river water or pit water can dig wells near the river or pit, one or two feet away from the bank. If you want to take water directly from the river or drink pit water, you must also pay attention to not letting livestock dirty it when they drink water, or people when they wash clothes. When river water or pit water is too cloudy, it must be filtered and clarified. The method is as follows: put some alum powder (also called Mingfan) into the water, stir it with a stick for a while, and after about fifteen minutes, the dirty things will slowly sink to the bottom. Another method: use a bucket or other larger water container, leave an opening near the bottom, spread some gravel inside, then some charcoal slag on top, and then some fine sand. After laying several layers like this, pour the water into the bucket, and when the water flows out of the small opening at the bottom of the bucket, it will be clean.
    The most important thing is that we should drink boiled water and not raw water. Some families keep some boiled water or rice soup left over from cooking, ready for drinking. This method is very good.
    "Illness enters through the mouth," so we must pay special attention to the hygiene of drinking water.

　　水
    人的身体需要水分，水分缺少了，会影响健康。因此，喝汤喝水在我们日常生活上是少不了的事情。
    咱们因各个地方的条件不同，有的人家吃井水、泉水；有的人家吃河水；更有的吃坑水。但是这些水里面或多或少都有病菌或脏东西，吃了容易生病。我们要想少生病，就应该注意吃水的卫生。
    怎样注意吃水的卫生呢？
    在有井的地方，可把井挖得深一些，因为井深了水的杂质越少。保持井水干净的方法：修筑井台，使井高出地面。井口加上盖子，打水家具要清洁，脏水坑和粪堆离井要远些。一般的泉水应该选择向着太阳的地方，在泉口要筑起围墙，加盖，防止脏水流进去。
    吃河水或坑水的村庄，可以在河或坑的附近挖井，井要离岸一二尺远。如要直接在河里取水或吃坑水的话，也一定要注意牲口喝水时，人洗衣时，不让弄脏它。河水、坑水太浑了的时候，必须要过滤和澄清。方法是这样的：把白矾（又叫明矾）末放一些到水里，用棍棒揽动一会，约十五分钟后，脏东西即慢慢沉到底下。另外一个方法：用一支桶或其他大些的盛水家具，靠底下留一个口，里面铺些碎石块，上面铺一些炭渣，再铺些细砂。这样铺上几层以后，把水倒在桶里，等水从桶底小口流出来的时候，就干净了。
    顶重要的一件事，就是我们要喝开水，不要吃生水。有些人家里做饭时留出一些开水或米汤来，预备着喝。这个方法很好。
    “病从口入”，我们对吃水的卫生要特别注意。
