Criticism and Suggestions

　　This Year Farmers' Production Enthusiasm is High
　　Cadres Should Strengthen Leadership
Editor:
　　I saw that the farmers in Xiyaotou Village, Erqu, Tangyin, were actively delivering manure to the fields as early as the second and third days of the Lunar New Year. According to incomplete statistics, this village delivered more than 2,000 loads in four or five days. They said: The spring ploughing is about to begin. The spring is long and the weather is warm this year. If we apply manure to the wheat fields now, the wheat seedlings will get strength after a few days of rain, and we will be able to get a good harvest. I think that because of the land reform, the farmers have a high enthusiasm for production to support the front lines. I only hope that the leading comrades of the relevant production departments will more specifically help the masses organize plans and lead production in response to Chairman Mao's call to "increase production by an inch."

　　Suggest that Lingshou County Government Find a Way to Build the Ci River Dam
Editor:
　　A lot of land along the Ci River in Gaoyang Village, Yiqu, Lingshou, was washed away last year, accounting for nearly one-third of the village's cultivated land area. The masses in the whole village are eager to build dams, but because the project is huge and beyond their capacity, the government said it would help repair it, but it has not yet been realized. The villagers are afraid that the land will be difficult to protect if there is another flood. Therefore, I specifically suggest that the Lingshou County Government should inspect the dikes of the villages along the Ci River and hope to help build them to protect the people's capital for getting rich—land. It is said that Huojia Village in the district has a similar situation. I hope you will inspect it together.

　　Some Suggestions on Medicine and Health
Editor:
　　I saw in the second edition of the People's Daily on January 26 that more than 60 of the more than 80 pharmacies in Handan City sold fake medicines. Fortunately, our democratic government immediately seized them and confiscated them, otherwise, I don't know how many people would have died or been injured.
　　In addition to agreeing with the three suggestions made by the Handan Administration for Industry and Commerce to the government, I would like to suggest to the Health Department of the North China People's Government: First, use a large part of your energy to write more scientific and popular health books, such as "Man and Disease," "Essentials of Practical Traditional Chinese Medicine," "Folk Remedies for Common Diseases," and "Common Sense of Hygiene." Second, books that explain in detail the methods of seeing a doctor and the names and dosages of medicines used by both traditional Chinese and Western medicine. Third, books on how to identify the authenticity of Chinese and Western medicines. Fourth, compile a book on prepared medicines that details the manufacturing methods of prepared medicines: such as the name of the prepared medicine, the raw materials used, the names and dosages of various medicines, the preparation method, what diseases it mainly treats, and how men, women, adults, and children should take it. Fifth, the Handan profiteers who manufacture fake medicines should be investigated and punished according to the law. I think it may be a special agent activity, using bloodless methods to poison the people in the liberated areas. Sixth, the relevant medical Q&As, health knowledge, and simple treatment methods published in newspapers should be compiled into a book. In short, a large number of books on health and medicine should be written and promoted in various places. Seventh, it is suggested that Xinhua Bookstore should print a large number of the above-mentioned books and distribute them to bookstores in various places, so that even every rural area can see such health books, so that even people with a smattering of literacy can understand them, creating a mass movement to eliminate epidemics. Making everyone healthy is beneficial to the construction of the new China.

　　Some Opinions on Opening Irrigation Canals
　　According to the results of watering the land for three years in the Jizhong Jin'gao Irrigation Canal and the recent survey of twelve villages, the general reflection is that the water is not timely and cannot meet the farmers' water requirements. According to the usual irrigation volume, two cubic meters of water per second, excluding 30% of the consumption, can irrigate 580 mu of land in 24 hours. According to the current irrigation area of more than 30,000 mu, it takes two months to rotate once. If we add breaches and dry rivers, the time will be extended. After the project is restored, it can irrigate more than 30,000 mu of land, but this is only 40% of the old area in the past. If we expand it further, the problem will not be solved.
　　Because the water is not timely, there is a phenomenon of grabbing water when the water comes, which is very difficult to control. For example, last June, the river dried up three times in a row (I don't know if it was because the river was completely cut off upstream). Every time the water came, some grabbed it and some couldn't use the water. Therefore, the people reflected that "they put in the effort but couldn't irrigate the land well." The most urgent problem at the moment is the solution of the water source problem. Based on this situation, I would like to ask the following questions for reply:
　　1. Water source problem: A canal that can irrigate 200,000 mu has been opened upstream. They also use the water of the Hutuo River. It is already difficult to use water here, which makes it even more difficult. We hope to unify the control and distribution of water. Is it possible to do this?
　　2. Whether the Shijin Canal will be excavated is related to this.
　　3. The instruction for water conservancy construction last year was: the burden will only be increased after three to five years of formal irrigation. Here, it has only been half a year since formal irrigation. Some district and county cadres plan to increase the burden before the wheat season. The masses reflect that last year's burden was heavier than in previous years (because the crops in the irrigated land were more abundant, so the burden was heavier). We don't know if the policy has changed. We hope for clear instructions.

### 批评与建议

专栏：

　　批评与建议 　 今年农民生产情绪高
  　干部更应该加强领导编辑同志：
    我看到汤阴二区西窑头村农民，在旧历年初二、三就积极往地里送粪了，据不完全统计，这个村四、五天就送了两千多担。他们说：春耕眼看要开始了，今年春长天暖，现在先把粪上到麦地里，过几天一下雨麦苗就吃上劲了，就能得个好收成。我想，由于土地改革后，农民生产支援前线的情绪都很高，唯希望各有关生产部门的领导同志，更具体的帮助群众组织计划，领导生产，以响应毛主席提出的“生产长一寸”的号召。

    建议灵寿县政府设法修筑慈河堤编辑同志：
    灵寿一区高阳庄沿慈河土地去年被冲毁不少，几占全村耕地面积的三分之一。全村群众极盼修建堤坝，但因工程浩大，力所不及，公家说帮修，迄今仍未实现，村民惟恐大洪再发土地难保。因此特建议灵寿县政府应检查慈河沿岸村庄的堤防，并希望帮助兴建，以保人民发家致富的资本——土地。据说该区获家庄也是类似情形，望一并视查是盼。

    对医药卫生的几点建议编者同志：
    我看到人民日报一月二十六日第二版登出的邯郸市八十多家药商，就有六十多家出售假药之事，幸亏我民主政府立即查获给予没收，否则不知要死伤多少人民。
    我除同意邯郸工商局向政府提的三点建议外，我再建议华北人民政府卫生部：第一、用大部精力著作更多科学的通俗的卫生书籍，如人和病、实用中药大要、百病偏方、卫生常识等书。第二、不论中医西医的看病法与用的药名药量要详加说明等书。第三、怎样认识中西药品的真伪办法等书。第四、要把成药的制造法：如成药名称、所用何原料及各种药名药量、配制法、主治何病、男女大小人的服用法等，详加著作一本成药书籍。第五、对邯郸奸商制造假药品，应该追根归案法办，我认为可能是特务活动，用杀人不见血的手段，来毒害解放区人民。第六、各报纸所登的有关医药问答，卫生常识，及简单治疗法，应汇集成册，总之有关卫生医药书籍要大量著作推广各地。第七、建议新华书店要将上述著作的书籍，大量印出分发各地书店出售，以至每个农村都能看到此种卫生书籍，使一般粗通文字的人们也能看懂，造成一个群众性的消灭疫病工作。使人人都健康，这对新中国的建设是有利的事。

　　对开水渠的几个意见
    冀中晋藁灌溉渠，根据三年来浇地的结果，与最近十二个村庄的调查，一般的反映是水不及时，不能满足农民的使水要求。按平常灌溉量计算，每秒两个立方米的水，除去百分之三十的消耗，二十四个钟头可浇地五百八十亩。根据目下浇地的面积三万多亩计算，需两个月才能轮返一次，如再加上决口和干河则时间更需延长。工程恢复后，已可浇地三万多亩，但这也不过是占过去旧有面积的百分之四十，如再往大处开展将更不能解决问题。
    由于水不及时，水来后发生抢水现象，掌握上非常困难，如在去年六月连着干了三次河（不知是否因上游将河全部截死而干的），每次水来后有的抢着，有的使不到水，因此老百姓反映“出了力浇不好地”。刻下最迫切的问题就是水源问题的解决，据此情况，特提以下几个问题请答复：
    一、水源问题：上游开了一个能浇二十万亩的渠道，他们也是使滹沱河的水，这里本来使水就困难，这样更加困难，我们盼望统一掌握分配水量，是否能这样作？
    二、石津运河是否开挖，于此有关。
    三、去年兴修水利的指示是：正式浇地三年至五年才增加负担，这里正式浇地才半年，有的区县干部打算在麦季前增加负担，群众的反映去年的负担比往年重（因渠浇地庄稼收成多，所以负担重），我们不知政策是否有改变，望明确指示。
