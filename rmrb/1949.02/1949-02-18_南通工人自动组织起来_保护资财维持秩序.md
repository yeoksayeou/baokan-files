Xinhua News Agency, East China, 16th: Nantong County Tangjiazhai workers spontaneously organized to protect assets and maintain order, welcoming the People's Liberation Army. Before the Kuomintang bandit troops prepared to flee, more than two thousand workers remaining at the Dasheng Textile Factory and Guangsheng Oil Factory in the Tangjiazhai factory district north of Nantong city secretly organized workers' pickets and prepared slogans to welcome the People's Liberation Army. They repeatedly refused the enemy's orders to retreat to the south of the Yangtze River. On the first of this month, after the Kuomintang bandit troops fled, the workers immediately posted slogans welcoming the People's Liberation Army. On the morning of the 2nd, a picket team of 917 workers stood guard around the factory and at important intersections in the town to maintain order. The People's Liberation Army entered Nantong that morning, and the city's order was stable. Most of the assets and documents of factories, schools, banks, and government offices were intact. That night, the power plant resumed supplying electricity as usual. On the 4th, the "Xinhua Telegraph" of the Nantong branch of Xinhua News Agency began publication.

　　南通工人自动组织起来
  　保护资财维持秩序
    【新华社华东十六日电】南通县唐家闸工人自动组织起来保护资财维持秩序，欢迎人民解放军。当国民党匪军准备逃走前南通城北工厂区唐家闸大生纺织厂和广生油厂的二千多留厂工人就秘密组织了工人纠察队，并准备好欢迎解放军的标语口号。他们曾几次拒绝了敌人撤到江南去的命令。本月一日国民党匪军逃走后，工人们即将欢迎人民解放军的标语贴出。二日清晨，九一七个工人组成的纠察队即在工厂四周及镇上要道口站岗维持秩序。解放军是日上午进驻南通，市内秩序安定，工厂、学校、银行、机关所有资财文件大部完好无损。当晚发电厂即照常送电。四日，新华社南通支社的“新华电讯”即开始发刊。
