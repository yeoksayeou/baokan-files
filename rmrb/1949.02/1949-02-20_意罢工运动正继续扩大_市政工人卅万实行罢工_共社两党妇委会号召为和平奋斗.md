Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 18th: Agence France-Presse, Rome, 15th: 300,000 municipal workers throughout Italy went on strike on the morning of the 15th, demanding increased wages. In Sicily, the miners' strike has continued for 45 days. The miners' strike in Sardinia has also lasted for more than a month. Workers in 47 textile factories in Prato have begun "rotating" strikes to protest the employers' action of closing two factories due to the sit-down strike by workers in those two textile factories.

Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 18th: TASS, Rome, 15th: The cooperation committee of the National Women's Committees of the Italian Communist Party and the Socialist Party held a meeting here to discuss the current tasks of the women's movement. The meeting passed a resolution calling on women to contribute all their strength to the common struggle to ensure that the Italian people's will to strive for peace is respected, and that the obligations undertaken by all political parties—not to participate in military blocs—are respected. The resolution pointed out that the government is violating these obligations and attempting to drag Italy into a war against the Soviet Union and against the democratic and liberation movements around the world.

Furthermore: After a recent meeting, the leadership of the Italian Socialist Party issued a communique stating that after studying the international situation and the government's policies aimed at having Italy accept "many dangerous obligations on and outside the continent," the Socialist Party leadership emphatically declared that they will strive to pursue a policy of peace and neutrality.

    【新华社陕北十八日电】据法新社罗马十五日讯：全意三十万市政工人于十五日晨起实行罢工，要求增加工资。在西西里，矿工的罢工已持续了四十五日。撒丁岛的矿工罢工，亦已持续月余，普拉托四十七所纺织工厂的工人，已开始“轮流”罢工，以抗议雇主因两个纺织工厂工人举行静坐罢工而停闭两厂的行动。
    【新华社陕北十八日电】塔斯社罗马十五日讯：意大利共产党与社会党之两党全国妇女委员会的合作委员会，在此间举行会议，讨论妇女运动的当前任务。会议通过决议，号召妇女们贡献一切力量于共同斗争，使全意大利人民争取和平的意志得到尊重，以及使一切政党所承担的义务——不参加军事集团——得到尊重。决议指出：政府正违犯这些义务，试图将意大利拉入反苏及反对全世界民主与解放运动的战争中。
    又讯：意大利社会党领导机关最近举行会议以后发表公报称：社会党领导机关研究了国际形势以及政府所采取的旨在使意大利接受“在大陆上及大陆以外的很多危险义务”的政策之后，确切申明，他们将努力奉行和平与中立的政策。
