[Jidong Telegram] Farmers in Ninghe, Yutian, Baodi, and other places are actively overcoming difficulties such as shortages of seeds, fertilizers, and livestock, as well as drought, to prepare for planting spring wheat. According to statistics from five districts in Ninghe County, a total of 292 head of livestock have been purchased from last autumn to the present. Many villages have overcome the past habit of not accumulating fertilizer due to alkaline or flooded land. In Jiangwakou Village, District 1, all 285 households had prepared three bean cakes per mu of land before the Spring Festival. In Lao'an Village, District 3, each household has accumulated three to four carts of fertilizer. In addition, farmers in various places are actively building water conservancy projects during the slack farming season. According to incomplete statistics, 1,902 mu of low-lying land in the county have been converted into garden land. Wangjiapu Haozigou has opened canals for irrigation, and 480 mu of alkaline land have been transformed into wheat fields. The county plans to plant a total of 50,000 mu of wheat this year, more than 6,000 mu more than last year. However, due to the hail disaster last summer and the destruction by the Kuomintang bandit troops, the wheat yield last year was generally reduced, resulting in an extreme shortage of wheat seeds this year. The County Party Committee has specifically instructed all districts to vigorously call on farmers to lend wheat seeds to each other and to organize district and village wheat seed adjustment committees so that districts and villages with surplus wheat can adjust with districts and villages lacking wheat.

Yutian County is preparing to sow more than 193,000 mu of spring wheat. Under the leadership of the government, farmers have prepared most of the fertilizer. Some villages have already started delivering manure. In Hegal Village, District 12, most of the manure for 225 mu of wheat land has been delivered. Yang Yongqin (female), a military dependent in the village, was elected as a district labor hero last year and has become even more active in production, working with her mother-in-law to crush four carts of manure and deliver them to the fields in advance. Jia Enfu, a labor hero in Shaozhuangzi, District 11, leads the masses in formulating village production plans. In order to overcome the difficulties of drought and dry land that prevent sowing, they plan to use 25 old wells to irrigate 70 mu of spring wheat and dig 10 new wells to irrigate 30 mu. This area has never had the habit of selecting and soaking seeds. Under the government's call, some villages have begun to select seeds. Ji Guanglu of Xiaodaodi Village soaked the wheat seeds in water, threw away the insect-bitten wheat grains floating on the surface, and then fished them out to dry and prepare for sowing. Under his influence, the whole village began to soak and wash wheat seeds. Farmers in the Baodi flood-stricken area are striving to plant early to prevent wheat from developing gray spot disease and are actively delivering manure. In Beitan Town, two-thirds of the manure for 4,200 mu of wheat land has been delivered. Zhang Ruifeng and his wife delivered manure for 11 mu of land in one day.

[Jilu豫 Telegram] Li Village, Nanwang County, has a total of 19.90 qing of land. Last year, due to flooding, most of the water did not recede, and only 52 mu of wheat land were cultivated. This spring, the district cadres called on people to rush to plant spring wheat and led the masses to discuss it. During the discussion, everyone believed that "our village has planted spring wheat in the past, and we have harvested a lot of grain." Then, the issues of wheat seeds and planting methods were discussed. After the meeting, the masses actively took action. Starting from the first day of the Lunar New Year, some began to cultivate the land. When planting wheat, everyone helped each other, creating a surge in planting spring wheat. By the fifth day, in just five days, the whole village had planted a total of 15.50 qing of spring wheat.

　　鼓励农民间相互借贷麦种
  　宁河等地抢种春麦
    南旺县李村已种上春麦十五顷
    【冀东电】宁河、玉田、宝坻等地农民，正积极克服种子、肥料、牲畜以及天旱困难，准备播种春麦。据宁河县五个区的统计，由去秋到现在共增购牲畜二百九十二头，很多村庄克服了过去因碱性地或水淹地不积肥的习惯，一区江洼口全村二百八十五户，在春节前即有一百八十户做到每亩地准备好三块豆饼。三区老安店每户都已积了三车至四车肥料。此外，各地农民利用农闲积极兴修水利，据不完全统计，全县已有一千九百零二亩洼下地改成园子地。王家铺貉子沽开渠浇地，有四百八十亩碱地已变成麦田。该县今年计划共种麦五万亩，比去年多六千多亩。但由于遭受去年夏季的雹灾及国民党匪军破坏，使去年麦地普遍减产，致使今年麦种极为缺乏。该县县委特指示各区大力号召农民互相借贷麦种，组织区村麦种调剂委员会，使麦子多的区村与缺麦的区村互相调剂。
    玉田全县准备播种春麦十九万三千余亩。政府领导下，农民已将肥料大部备齐。有的村已开始送粪。十二区何各庄，二百二十五亩麦地的粪已大部送完。该村军属杨永勤（女）去年当选区劳动英雄后，生产更加积极，和婆婆一同捣粪四车，提前送到地里。十一区邵庄子劳动英雄贾恩福领导群众订村生产计划，为克服天旱地干不能播种的困难，准备利用旧井二十五口浇种春麦七十亩，再挖新井十口，浇种三十亩。该地向无选种浸种习惯，在政府号召下有的村庄已开始选种。小稻地村吉光禄把麦种浸入水中，把漂在水面上的被虫咬的麦粒扔掉，再捞出晒干准备播种，在他影响下全村均开始浸洗麦种。宝坻水灾区农民，为防止麦子长灰疸病，都争取早种，现正积极送粪。北潭镇四千二百亩麦地，已将粪送完三分之二，张瑞丰和妻子二人一天即送完十一亩地的粪。
    【冀鲁豫电】南旺县李树村共十九顷九十亩地，去年因遭水淹，大部分水没有退去，仅耕了五十二亩麦地。今春区干部号召赶种春麦，并领导群众进行讨论，讨论中，大家认为“过去咱村种过春麦，也不少打粮食。”接着讨论了麦种与种法的问题，会后，群众便积极行动起来，从旧历正月初一起，有的就开始耩地。耩麦的时候，都是你帮我，我帮你，造成种春麦的热潮。到了初五，仅仅五天工夫，全村就共种春麦十五顷五十亩地。
