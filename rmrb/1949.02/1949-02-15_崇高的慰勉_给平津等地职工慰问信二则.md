Lofty Condolences
    -- Two Letters of Condolence to Workers in the Tianjin-Beijing Area

Brothers and sisters of the Shijingshan, Mentougou, and Tianjin-Beijing areas:

    After we received the news of your liberation, all of our employees were overjoyed. Especially after learning of your heroic and selfless protection of the machines in the emergency situation, and your clever driving away of the enemy; recalling the past when you lived in poverty and hunger under the bloody rule of the Japanese invaders and the Kuomintang, and constantly carried out unyielding struggles against the reactionary forces, all of this demonstrated the excellent tradition of the great working class. Beloved brothers and sisters! Now is the time for our working class and the revolutionary people of all other strata in the country. Under the leadership of our working class party—the Communist Party—we must continue to work hard, resolutely and persistently to the end. Recently, Chiang Kai-shek, this blood-sucking head, seeing that his dog's life is not long, has played a set of peace conspiracies with us, dreaming of getting a respite so that he can make a comeback in the future and strangle the revolution. We will never be fooled by these tricks again. Our wise leader Chairman Mao has exposed his sinister conspiracy and put forward the eight proposals for true peace. We must resolutely follow our leader Chairman Mao and our party—the Communist Party—and carry the revolution through to the end. We, on behalf of all employees, extend our warm welcome and condolences to you. From now on, we should jointly step up production and strive to support the front lines in order to liberate all of China.
    　　　　　
   Respectfully, to the working class
    　　　　　　　　　　　　
   Shijiazhuang Electric Light Company Workers' Union

Dear female workers of the yarn factories in Beiping and Tianjin:

    I am so happy for you that you have been liberated. How much suffering you have endured in these years! We have also been liberated from oppression. I have also been oppressed by capitalists and deceived by the Kuomintang, but now we have thrown ourselves into the arms of our mother. The Communist Party is our mother. I found her, and I found the future. Now the lives of the workers here are very good. Some work eight hours a day, and some work ten hours a day. After work, there is still an hour of study. Our study content includes arithmetic, Chinese language, and political lessons. The workers' awareness has been raised. Recently, we also requested an hour of technical class every day. This kind of consciousness is because we have realized that the factory is our own and needs everyone to build and protect it. As soon as we heard of the liberation of Tianjin and Beijing, every worker automatically organized a Yangko team and celebrated your liberation with a deafening sound of gongs and drums. The workers here automatically proposed a production increase competition in order to step up support for the front lines. Every worker said, "I guarantee that my car will produce more, less waste, no knots, and no runaway car." Every worker has this idea: Everyone unites and works hard to produce, and no one wants to fall behind. In order to cultivate the workers' culture, the government and the trade union give each of us the opportunity to go to school, and the workers can participate in the regime. My name is Chen Wei. I am a female worker in the Fanrong Factory. Now I also participate in the work of the trade union. I hope that you there will also quickly unite and organize, strive to improve your business, build your own factory, and actively produce to support the front lines. We all have one goal, which is to completely eliminate Chiang Kai-shek and those reactionaries, so that the people of China will never be oppressed again, and build a happy new society.
    　　　　　　　
   With
    Revolutionary Greetings!

　　崇高的慰勉
    ——给平津等地职工慰问信二则石景山、门头沟、平津诸位职工兄弟们：
    在我们接到你们获得解放消息以后，我们全体职工欢庆若狂，尤其知道了你们在紧急情况中，英勇的奋不顾身的保护了机器，机智的驱走了敌人；回想过去你们在日寇国民党血腥的统治下，过着贫苦饥寒的日子，不断的向反动势力进行不屈不挠的斗争，这一切都表现了伟大的工人阶级优良的传统。敬爱的弟兄们！现在是我们工人阶级和全国其他各阶层革命人民的天下了，我们要在我们工人阶级的政党——共产党领导下，继续努力坚决的顽强的干到底。最近蒋介石这个吸血头子，眼看着他的狗命不长了，向我们耍了一套和平阴谋，梦想得到一个喘息机会，以便将来卷土重来，扼死革命。这些鬼把戏，我们是再也不会上他的当了，我们英明的领袖毛主席已揭露了他险恶的阴谋，提出了真正和平的八项主张。我们要坚决追随自己的领袖毛主席、自己的政党——共产党，将革命进行到底。我们代表全体职工向你们致热烈的欢迎和慰问。今后我们应共同加紧生产，努力支援前线，以解放全中国。
    　　　　　此致工人阶级敬礼
    　　　　　　　　　　　　石家庄市电灯公司职工会亲爱的北平天津各纱厂的女工姐妹们：
    我听到你们那里解放了，我真为您们高兴。你们在这些年中是受了多么大的痛苦啊！我们也是从受压迫中解放出来的。我也受过资本家的压迫，也受过国民党的欺骗，可是我们现在已经投在母亲的怀抱里了，共产党是咱们的母亲，我找着了她，也就是找到了前途。现在我们这里的工人生活非常好，每天工作有的八小时，有的十小时，下班后还有一个钟头的学习，我们的学习内容有算术、国语和政治课。工人们的觉悟提高了，近来我们还要求每天上一个钟头的技术课，这样的自觉，是因为我们已认识到工厂是我们自己的，需要大家自己来建设和保护。我们一听到平津解放，每一个工人都自动的组织起秧歌队，锣鼓喧天的热烈庆祝你们解放，我们这里的工人们为了加紧支援前线自动提出增产竞赛。每一个工人都说：“我保证我这车上出数多，白花少，不练疙疸，不跑车”，每一个工人都有这样的思想：大家团结起来努力生产，谁也不愿意落在人后。政府和工会为了培养工人们的文化，叫我们每人都有上学校的机会，工人都能参加政权。我的名字叫陈玮，是繁荣厂的女工，现在我也参加了工会工作，希望你们那里也赶快团结与组织起来，努力的提高业务，建设自己的工厂，积极生产支援前线。我们大家都为了一个目的，就是要把蒋介石那些反动派们，彻底的消灭干净，使全中国人民永远不再受压迫，建设幸福的新社会。
    　　　　　　致以
    革命敬礼！
