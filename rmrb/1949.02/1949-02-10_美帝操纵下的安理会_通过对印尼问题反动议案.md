　　US Imperialism Manipulates the Security Council
  　Passes Reactionary Resolution on Indonesian Issue
    【Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 3rd】Reports from various sources: On January 28th, the United Nations Security Council, manipulated by the United States, passed a reactionary resolution on the Indonesian issue jointly proposed by the representatives of the United States, Cuba, Norway, and the Kuomintang reactionary government, exposing the collaboration between the United States and the Netherlands in enslaving the Indonesian people. The key points of this reactionary resolution are as follows: (1) It demands that the government of the Republic of Indonesia order Indonesian anti-Dutch forces to cease guerrilla warfare and cooperate with Dutch forces to "restore peace and maintain order." (2) It demands that the Dutch immediately release captured Indonesian reactionary government leaders such as Hatta in order to implement the above provision. (3) Both sides should conduct "negotiations" to establish a so-called "provisional federal government of all Indonesia" before July 15, 1949; hold so-called "elections" before October 1 of the same year to establish an Indonesian Constituent Assembly; and transfer power to the so-called "United States of Indonesia" before July 1, 1950. (4) The Security Council's Indonesian "conciliation" committee, which the United States uses as a tool to invade Indonesia, will be renamed the "Indonesian Committee," and its powers will be expanded.
    According to a TASS report: Soviet representative Malik revealed in the Security Council on the 23rd that the proposal was the result of behind-the-scenes bargaining between the United States and the Netherlands. Malik analyzed the proposal point by point, stating: (1) Not demanding the immediate withdrawal of Dutch troops, but demanding that the Indonesian side cease resistance to the aggressors, is intended to enable the Dutch to consolidate their currently shaky occupation and legitimize their aggression. (2) The decision on Hatta and others is intended to make them more dependent on the aggressors. (3) Without the withdrawal of Dutch troops, any so-called elections and negotiations to establish a government are completely hypocritical. (4) The change of name and expansion of power of the "conciliation" committee is intended to allow the United States to further interfere in Indonesia's internal affairs and protect its interests in Indonesia. According to an estimate by the American magazine Fortune, these interests have reached the sum of the profits obtained by Britain and the Netherlands in Indonesia before the war. Malik reiterated the Soviet Union's position of supporting the right of colonial peoples to independence and autonomy, demanding "the immediate withdrawal of all Dutch troops without exception from the territory of the Republic of Indonesia"; and emphasized: Since the Security Council meeting, "representatives of the United States and Britain have repeatedly rejected the Soviet proposal to immediately withdraw Dutch troops from Indonesia, and therefore must bear full responsibility for protecting the Dutch in completing their aggression plan."
    On the 27th, the US side made some so-called "amendments" to the proposal at the Security Council meeting, stipulating that after Hatta and others are released, they can "exercise their powers" not only in Yogyakarta City but also in the vicinity of Yogyakarta. Then the US representative insisted on putting the proposal to a vote. On January 28, the Security Council, manipulated by the United States and its "majority" of nations, passed the anti-Indonesian people's proposal led by the United States, thereby ending its month-long and seven-day discussion of the Dutch aggression against Indonesia.

　　美帝操纵下的安理会
  　通过对印尼问题反动议案
    【新华社陕北三日电】各方报导：一月二十八日，美国操纵下的联合国安理会通过了一项由美国、古巴、挪威及国民党反动政府代表联合提出的印尼问题的反动决议，把美国和荷兰狼狈为奸地奴役印尼人民的面目，一丝不挂地暴露了。这个反动决议有下列数要点：（一）要求印尼共和国政府命令印尼抗荷部队停止游击战争，并与荷军共同合作，以“恢复和平与维持秩序”。（二）要求荷方立即释放哈达等被俘的印尼反动政府首领，以执行上项规定。（三）双方进行“谈判”，俾于一九四九年七月十五日以前成立所谓“全印尼的临时联邦政府”；同年十月一日以前举行所谓“选举”，成立印尼制宪议会；一九五○年七月一日以前，将政权交与所谓“印尼合众团”。（四）将美国作为侵略印尼工具的安理会印尼“调处”委员会改名为“印尼委员会”，权力予以扩大。
    据塔斯社消息：苏联代表马里克二十三日在安理会上揭露了该提案乃美国与荷兰幕后讨价还价的结果。马立克逐条分析该提案称：（一）不要求荷军立即撤退，却要求印尼方面停止对侵略者的抵抗，乃欲使荷方巩固其目前已在摇动中的占领地位，并使其侵略行动合法化。（二）对哈达等的决定，乃欲使他们更依赖于侵略者。（三）荷军不撤退，任何所谓选举与谈判成立政府的举动，都是澈头澈尾虚伪的。（四）“调处”委员会的改换招牌与扩大权力，乃欲使美国得以进一步干涉印尼内政，并保护其在印尼的利益。据美幸福杂志估计，这种利益已达战前英荷两国在印尼所获利润的总和。马立克重申苏联支持殖民地人民应有独立自主权利的立场，要求“所有荷军无例外地立即自印尼共和国领土撤退”；并强调指出：自安理会开会以来，“美英等国代表一再拒绝苏联所提应使荷军立即自印尼撤退的建议，因而须负庇护荷兰完成其侵略计划的全部责任。”
    二十七日，美方在安理会会议上对提案作了一些所谓“修正”，规定哈达等被释放后，不仅可在日惹城内，还可在日惹附近地区“行使职权”。接着美国代表便坚持要求对该提案付诸表决。一月二十八日，美国操纵下的安理会“多数”国，通过了以美国为首的反印尼人民的议案，从而结束了其一个月零七天的对荷兰侵略印尼问题的讨论。
