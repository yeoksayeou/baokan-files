Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, January 31st: How should the civilian laborers and stretcher-bearer teams, which play a significant role in supporting the People's Liberation War, be mobilized, organized, educated, managed, and utilized to maximize their effectiveness? This is a problem that needs to be solved in all liberated areas. The Shaanxi-Gansu-Ningxia and Shanxi-Suiyuan Border Regions have gained the following experience in summarizing their past civilian labor work:

　　(1) An important part of mobilizing civilian laborers is that the allocation of duties must be fair and reasonable. The method of mobilizing civilian laborers in the Fourth District of Liulin Township, Yan'an County, is relatively good. Under the principle of reasonable burden and taking care of production, the village first used the township or administrative village as a unit, and in accordance with the number of people to be mobilized stipulated by the higher authorities, after democratic evaluation, considering the amount and strength of family labor, economic conditions, and the amount of previous service provided, it was decided who should serve. The second step was to calculate the total number of workdays to be supported by the entire township or administrative village, based on the number of people mobilized from the entire township or administrative village, according to the service period and the standard for calculating workdays. The third step was to distribute the total number of workdays of the entire township or administrative village to all households that should bear the burden, through democratic evaluation. In the fourth step, if a household willing to serve voluntarily provided more workdays in a certain instance, then, through democratic evaluation, the extra workdays could be guaranteed by households that had not yet served, who would return the work or grain (wages determined democratically) on a regular basis. This can avoid the phenomenon of cadres assigning tasks and hiring idlers as substitutes. Before mobilization, the village also explained to the masses the current victorious situation of the Liberation War, the important significance of serving with the army, and made it clear about the tasks and the duration of service. This is also very important. Experience in many areas has shown that if the tasks and duration are not explained clearly in advance, or if deceptive methods are adopted, many difficulties will arise at the front. When mobilizing civilian laborers in newly liberated areas, the tasks should be explained clearly, and it must be explained that the People's Liberation Army and the Kuomintang bandit army are two different types of armies. The People's Liberation Army will never force civilian laborers serving with the army to become soldiers halfway through, as the Kuomintang bandit army did.

　　(2) Organizations must strive to be sound. When stretcher-bearer teams are assembled, it is necessary to check whether the team members are qualified, and those who are truly unqualified should not be forced to make up the numbers, so as not to waste effort. The county- and district-level capable cadres should be appointed as the captains and deputy captains of the stretcher-bearer teams, so as to educate the civilian laborers at the front and assist the work of the mass movement departments in the troops. Each team should be equipped with a certain number of livestock to carry cooking utensils and some rations. Linjin and Wanquan counties in southern Shanxi often equip their standing stretcher-bearer teams with doctors, shoe repairers, etc., which has been of great convenience at the front. Xinzheng County (newly established county) in the Guanzhong Sub-district also specially established couriers to deliver letters to and from the military civilian laborers in the county, which played a great role in consolidating the civilian laborers. Jingbian County also issued service certificates to stretcher-bearer team members after their service period expired before they were allowed to return home, which was also an effective way to consolidate the stretcher-bearer teams.

　　(3) Regarding education and management, the troops should take more responsibility. For stretcher-bearer teams in the new areas, a movement to denounce the atrocities of the Kuomintang bandit army can be launched to gradually improve the political understanding and class consciousness of the team members, so that they recognize that the People's Liberation Army is the army of the people, and that carrying stretchers and rescuing the wounded is to protect their own lives and property. They must also be given education on military common sense and first-aid knowledge from time to time to eliminate the fear of war among the civilian laborers due to lack of battlefield experience. In terms of life, the troops should give all kinds of care, and food and lodging should be the same as the soldiers. If there are casualties and diseases, they should also receive the same treatment as the soldiers. The leaders of the troops should be close to the civilian laborers, encourage them frequently, solve their specific problems, and guide them to live a collective and tense life, so as to improve their morale and reduce their homesickness. Beating and scolding civilian laborers must be absolutely prohibited. After each battle, spiritual and material rewards should be given separately. A farewell party should be organized when they return home at the end of their service period. Experience in various places has proved that civilian laborers who have been well-educated and managed can not only complete the task of supporting the war, but also many people ask to join the People's Liberation Army, or become good propagandists of victory and activists in the mass movement after returning home.

　　(4) In terms of use, the troops should promptly grasp the emotions of the civilian laborers and give them appropriate tasks. Civilian laborers should not be used in the same way as soldiers to avoid unnecessary casualties. For this reason, the various units of the Northwest People's Liberation Army specifically organized stretcher squads in each regiment and rescue teams in each company, first rescuing the wounded from the front line and then handing them over to the civilian stretcher-bearer teams to carry them to the rear.

　　怎样组织和领导民工？
  　陕甘宁、晋绥边区民工工作经验总结　
    【新华社延安三十一日电】对于支援人民解放战争起着重大作用的民工担架队，要如何动员、组织、教育管理和使用他们，才能发挥其最大效能呢？这是各解放区都须要解决的问题。陕甘宁晋绥边区在总结历次民工工作中取得了这样几项经验：
    （一）动员民工的重要环节，在于差务的分配必须公平合理。延安县柳林区四乡动员民工的办法是比较好的。该村在合理负担与照顾生产的原则下，第一步以乡或行政村为单位，依上级规定的动员人数，经过民主评议，照顾家庭劳动力的多少和强弱，经济状况及过去支差的多少三条件，议定应该服务的人。第二步根据全乡或全行政村动员的人数，按照服务期限与计工标准，算出全乡或全行政村的总支工数。第三步以民主评议的方法，将全乡或全行政村的总支工数分配全乡或全行政村所有应负担的各户分担。第四步出征户如自愿在某次多支工，则可再经过民主评议方式，将其所多支之工数由未出征户保证定期还工或还粮（工资由民主议定）。这样便可避免干部指派和雇二流子顶替的现象。该村在动员之前，并先向群众讲解了目前解放战争胜利的形势，随军服务的重要意义，公开讲清任务和服务的期限。这一点也是很重要的。许多地区经验证明，如果事前不把任务和期限交代清楚或采取哄骗的办法，其结果，到前方后，会发生许多困难。在新解放区动员民工时，尤应讲清任务，并须说明解放军与国民党匪军是两种不同性质的军队，解放军对随军服务的民工决不会象国民党匪军那样半路就要他当兵。
    （二）组织须力求健全。担架队集中时，须检查队员是否合格，真正不合格者不应勉强凑数，以免徒劳往返。担架队大、中队长应派县、区级得力干部充任，以便在前方教育民工和协助部队中民运部门的工作。每队应配备一定的牲口，驮运炊具和一部口粮。晋南临晋、万泉等县常备担架队内并配备有医生、钉鞋匠等，在前方获得很大方便。关中分区新正县（新设县）还专门设立了传递家书的通讯员，为本县随军民工来往传递书信，在巩固民工上起了很大作用。靖边县在担架队员服务期满后，发给服务证，始得回家，也是巩固担架队有效的办法。
    （三）教育管理问题，部队方面应多负责任。对于新区的担架队，可发动控诉国民党匪军暴行的运动，进而逐步提高队员们的政治认识及阶级觉悟，使他们认清解放军是人民自己的军队，抬担架，救护伤员，就是为了保护自己的生命财产。并须时常给以有关军事常识及救护常识的教育，以消除民工们因缺乏战地生活经验而起的对战争的畏惧心理。在生活方面，部队上应给以多方关照，住食应和战士一样，如有伤亡和疾病，也应与战士同等待遇。部队首长要多和民工接近，时常予以鼓励，解决他们的具体问题，并引导他们过集体紧张的生活，借以提高其情绪，减少想家念头。打骂民工，必须绝对禁止。在每次战役之后，应分别给以精神和物质上的奖励。期满回家时，应组织欢送会。各地经验证明，凡经过很好教育和管理的民工，不但能完成支援战争的任务，并有很多的人要求参加解放军，或者在回家后成为很好的胜利的宣传者和群众运动中的积极分子。
    （四）在使用问题上，部队应及时掌握民工的情绪给予适当的任务，不应把民工与战士同样地使用，以避免民工不必要的伤亡。为此，西北解放军各部特于每团组织担架排，每连组织抢救组，先从火线上将伤员抢救下来，再交民工担架队抬往后方。
