Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 13th: TASS Moscow, 9th: The Soviet Council of Ministers and the Central Committee of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union have recently issued a decision on the preparation of collective farms, machine and tractor stations, and state farms for spring planting. The decision points out that the main task of developing rural socialism in 1949 lies in further consolidating collective farms organizationally and economically, and increasing their property. The main task for crops is to maximize the yield of grains (referring to the production volume per unit area), increase the output of industrial crops, especially cotton, sugar beets, flax, hemp, and perennial pasture seeds. Large-scale preparations for spring sowing are underway in all collective farms. Collective farms are formulating production plans and specifying the tasks of each work team and work group. Based on advanced experience, many collective farm work teams and work groups are guaranteeing to exceed the crop yields (referring to the production volume per unit area) stipulated in the plan, breed more livestock, and increase their productivity. While drafting production plans, collective farms are also consolidating existing work teams and organizing new work groups. These work groups are led by advanced farmers. The decision further draws attention to the need to eliminate existing shortcomings in the design of collective farms and in the organization of work groups and work teams.

The decision points out that, in accordance with the state plan for the restoration and development of the Soviet national economy, collective farms will be required to complete the process of gradually planting grains only with selected seeds this year, in accordance with the plan for allocating varieties by region. In order to ensure that all areas are sown with selected seeds, the decision stipulates that 952,700 tons of superior varieties should be allocated to collective farms from the state grain reserves, allowing them to exchange them for ordinary grains. The decision tasks the Soviet Ministry of Agriculture and the Party and Soviet organs to implement a number of practical measures to ensure a gradual transition to planting only with selected seeds, as this is of paramount importance for increasing grain yields.

　　苏联部长会议及联共中央
    发布准备春季播种决定
    进一步巩固集体农场并增进其财产
    【新华社陕北十三日电】据塔斯社莫斯科九日讯：苏联部长会议与苏联共产党中央委员会顷发布一项关于集体农场、机器与拖拉机站及国营农场准备春季播种的决定。该决定指出：一九四九年发展农村社会主义的主要任务，在于使集体农场在组织上与经济上进一步巩固，并增进其财产。农作物中的主要任务，是最大限度地提高五谷的产量（按指一定面积上的生产量），增高工业作物，特别是棉花、甜菜、亚麻、大麻以及多年生的牧草种子的出产。春播的大规模准备工作，正在一切集体农场进行中。集体农场正在制订生产计划，并规定每一工作队和工作组的任务。许多集体农场的工作队与工作组，以先进的经验为基础，保证要超过计划所规定的作物产量（按指一定面积上的生产量），繁殖更多的牲畜，并提高其生产率。与草拟生产计划同时，集体农场也在巩固现有的工作队，并组织新的工作组。这些工作组由先进的农民领导。决定中进一步提起注意，必须消除集体农场在设计上和工作组及工作队在组织上的现存缺点。
    决定指出：遵照苏联国民经济恢复与发展的国家计划，集体农场将须在今年完成依照按区分配品种的计划，逐渐做到仅以选种来播种谷物的过程。为了保证全部面积都以选种来播种，该决定规定由国家的储粮中指拨九十五万二千七百吨高等品种给集体农场，让他们拿普通谷物来交换。该决定责成苏联农业部和党的与苏维埃的机关实行若干实际措施，来保证逐渐做到只以选种来种植，因为这对提高谷物产量具有头等的重要性。
