　　Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 20th. New York dispatch: The illegal "trial" of American Communist leaders in the New York Federal Court has been in session multiple times since January 17th. During the court session on the 14th, American Communist leaders continued to denounce the federal jury system that discriminates against workers, blacks, and Jews. Judge Medina, flying into a rage out of shame, ordered them to stop speaking, exposing the hideous face of the American ruling class's tool of domination—the federal court's trampling of human rights. The American Communist leaders immediately opposed this, and defense lawyers, such as Sergi Golezidin, also rose up in protest against this despicable measure of depriving the American Communist leaders of their due rights.

　　被非法“审讯”的美共领袖
  　抗议麦迪纳剥夺发言权
    【新华社陕北二十日电】纽约讯：纽约联邦法院对美共领袖的非法“审讯”，自一月十七日以来，业已开庭多次。在十四日开庭时，美共领袖继续指斥歧视工人、黑人和犹太人的联邦陪审团制度。法官麦迪纳竟老羞成怒下令制止他们发言；自己暴露了美国统治阶级的统治工具——联邦法院蹂躏人权的狰狞面目。美共领袖立即加以反对，辩护律师瑟琪·哥列兹丁等也纷起抗议这种剥夺美共领袖应有权利的卑劣处置。
