　　To the Propaganda Departments of all Special Administrative Offices and Counties in Chahar Province, and to all Correspondents:

　　Currently, it is the season of spring plowing and large-scale production. All localities are actively making arrangements and preparing for production. According to recent reports, the Fourth and Fifth Special Administrative Offices have each convened production symposiums, summarizing the production achievements of various localities last winter, reviewing some deviations in guiding production, and setting production plans for the entire region this year. Jianping, Xingtang, and Hunyuan counties have summarized various sideline productions from last winter and formulated production plans for this year. It is hoped that other regions will promptly organize reports on the situation of spring production and promptly reflect the production enthusiasm of the masses in various localities after the end of land reform.
