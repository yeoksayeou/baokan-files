　　Erase the Reactionary Slogans Left Behind by the Chiang Kai-shek Gang
　　To the Editorial Comrade:
　　Currently, I am seeing a phenomenon: that is, in our liberated areas, some places still retain reactionary slogans, catchphrases, and cartoons that slander revolutionary leaders. This is perhaps understandable in newly liberated areas, but it also exists in areas that have been liberated for a long time. For example, in Yuci, Jinzhong, which was liberated more than half a year ago, there are still reactionary slogans and cartoons left behind by the Chiang Kai-shek gang near the train station. I believe this is an unacceptable phenomenon. If new ones have not been written, then it is best to first erase the old ones. Otherwise, it will cause misunderstandings among people with shallow political common sense. Comrades in charge of propaganda and education in various regions should pay attention to this and not allow counter-revolutionary slogans to continue to exist, especially as there will be more newly liberated areas in the future, and the accompanying reactionary propaganda slogans will also increase. Therefore, I suggest that comrades in charge of propaganda and education in various regions should not neglect this task!

　　刷掉蒋匪残留下来的反动标语编辑同志：
    现在我看到这样一种现象：即是在我解放区里，有些地方还存留着反动标语、口号和污蔑革命领袖的漫画等。这事发生在新区还情有可原，但早已解放的地区也有，如象晋中榆次，解放迄今已有半年多，车站附近仍有蒋匪留下的反动标语口号和漫画。我认为这是不应有的现象，如果新的没写出来，那么最好是先将旧的刷掉，否则，会使一般政治常识浅薄的人发生误会的。这一点我们各地负责宣教工作的同志们应提起注意，不应使反革命的标语继续存在，特别是今后新的解放地区会更多起来，随之而来的这种反动的宣传标语也会多起来。因此我建议各地负责宣教的同志们不要忽视这一工作才对！　　　　　　　　王毓贤
