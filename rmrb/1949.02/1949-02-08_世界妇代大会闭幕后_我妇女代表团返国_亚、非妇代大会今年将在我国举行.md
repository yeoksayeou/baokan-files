　　Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, February 5th: The Chinese women's delegation that attended the Second World Democratic Women's Congress held in Budapest, Hungary, last December returned to China on the 9th of last month. The delegation was led by Cai Chang and included Zhang Qinqiu, Ding Ling, Lu Cui, Han Qimin, Qu Mengjue, Tang Guifen, Li Wenyi, Ulan, Li Landing, Wu Qing, Jiang Jintao, and eleven others.
　　They arrived in Budapest in three groups before and after November of last year. The congress opened on December 1st and closed on the 6th. The main spirit of the congress was to mobilize and organize democratic women around the world to participate in opposing a new fascist war and to uphold lasting peace and democracy. At the congress, Mrs. Gordon reported on her work over the past three years, the Italian representative reported on the tasks of the democratic women's movement, the American representative reported on the protection of women's rights, the Polish representative reported on child protection, and Cai Chang reported on the development of the Asian and African women's movement. There were enthusiastic discussions after the reports. Various committees were organized at the congress, such as the Credentials Committee, the committees for the above five reports, and the Finance and Economics Committee. Representatives of the Chinese delegation participated in the work of the committees and conducted many off-site activities. Finally, when the congress re-elected the leadership of the Women's International Democratic Federation—the Council—Cai Chang was re-elected as Vice-Chairman, He Xiangning, Deng Yingchao, Li Dequan, and Lu Cui were appointed as formal council members, and Ding Ling, Xu Guangping, and Shi Liang were alternate council members.
　　Due to the great victory of the Chinese People's Liberation War, the Chinese women's delegation received special love and respect from the democratic women representatives of the other thirty-nine countries present at the meeting, as well as a warm welcome and reception from the vast masses of the Hungarian people. Whenever they spoke at the congress or mass meetings about the victorious achievements of the Chinese People's Liberation War, the hall would erupt with frenzied cheers of "Long Live China!" "Long Live Mao Zedong!"
　　Before the meeting, they attended a welcome meeting organized by the Hungarian government. At this meeting, Rakosi, the General Secretary of the Hungarian Communist Party, personally delivered a speech, and the Hungarian Deputy Secretary of Women and representatives of female workers, farmers, youth, and children delivered speeches and presented flowers, all expressing a warm welcome. During and after the meeting, they were invited to visit Hungary's new democratic construction and participate in mass meetings in various places.
　　Zhang Qinqiu, Lu Cui, Wu Qing, and Li Wenyi attended the preparatory meeting for the Asian and African Women's Congress before the congress. More than ten representatives from China, India, Vietnam, Iran, North Korea, Outer Mongolia, and others attended the meeting. At the meeting, they listened to the report by Simon Petran and Lu Cui's report on the preparations. The meeting decided that the Asian and African Women's Congress must be held in 1949 and unanimously hoped that it would be held in China. Afterwards, they formed groups to carry out preparatory work.
　　When the delegation returned to China, they brought back congress reports, declarations, resolutions, and information on the women's democratic movements in various countries around the world, various photographs, and various exquisite gifts presented by representatives from various countries and the Hungarian people.
