　　Ping Sui Railway East Section Employees Work Actively
  　Quickly Complete Repair Tasks
    Zhangjiakou Enterprises and Factories Suffered Severe Damage from Bandit Troops
    [Zhangjiakou Electric Dispatch] The employees of the Ping Sui Railway's Nankou, Xiayuan, and Qinghuayuan sections, under the call to fully support the front lines, overcame all difficulties and quickly completed repair tasks. After we liberated Kangzhuang and Nankou last December, Nankou and Kangzhuang immediately organized repair teams to repair the sections between Qinglongqiao, Shacheng, and Kangzhuang. After four or five days of work, they repaired four and a half miles of railway and seven bridges. The work, originally expected to be completed in twenty days, was finished by 2 PM on the 18th, thanks to the efforts of the employees. The employees of the engineering section not only ensured the rapid restoration of the railway but also completed two highway bridges within three days, ensuring smooth highway traffic. In terms of military transport, although the enemy forced some employees to flee during their escape, and the equipment at each station was incomplete, the enormous military transport task was successfully carried out under the effective mobilization and appropriate organization of the comrades who took over and the comrades from the trade union, thanks to the active efforts of the employees. In just twenty-nine days, they transported more than 27,800 tons. Nankou originally had no dispatching office; all vehicles were dispatched from Beiping. To adapt to the busy military transport situation, a dispatching office was established. The transportation section originally had 191 employees, but now only 96 remain. The Nankou station originally had 105 people, but now only 69 remain. However, the maximum number of trains running daily reached 43 or 44, which is more than when the Kuomintang ruled with the most complete equipment and the entire line was open (about 30 times a day).
    [Zhangjiakou Electric Dispatch] During the two years and more that the Kuomintang bandit gang occupied Zhangjiakou and Xuanhua, the destruction of industry was very serious. In early October 1946, when the Kuomintang bandit troops attacked Zhangjiakou from the east and west with nine armies, their main purpose was to plunder the industrial equipment and materials of Zhangjiakou and Xuanhua. At that time, our democratic government and the People's Liberation Army, in order to protect this important national property, had painfully decided to evacuate before the bandit planes bombed and strafed, and transported part of the machinery belonging to the former Xuanhua Longyan Iron Mine, including the Xinhua Machine Manufacturing Factory and the Zhangjiakou North China Machine Factory, to the liberated areas so that they could continue to produce for the people. After the Kuomintang bandit troops invaded and occupied Zhangjiakou and Xuanhua, they arbitrarily dismantled and stole the light and heavy industrial machinery in the two places. This kind of destruction reached its peak before the People's Liberation Army marched on the Ping Sui front line in early November. According to reliable statistics, the factories in Zhangjiakou and Xuanhua that were damaged included the Xinhua Machine Factory, the Xinhua Iron Smelting Factory, the Machine Factory belonging to the Longyan Iron Mine, the Fireproof Brick Factory in Xuanhua, and the North China Machine Factory in Zhangjiakou. The total number of machinery stolen from these factories, such as lathes, hexagonal lathes, planers, machine tools, electric motors, electric hammers, phosphorus furnaces, steel furnaces, and boilers, reached more than 400 units. In addition, there were more than 2,330 tons of pig iron, steel plates, iron plates, steel bars, and iron bars. Among them, the Xinhua Machine Factory in Xuanhua and the North China Machine Factory in Zhangjiakou suffered the most serious damage. The above two factories happened to be the essence of the entire machine industry in these two major industrial cities in the border region. After the Kuomintang bandits stole all the machinery from the Xinhua Machine Factory in Xuanhua (most of the factory's machines were new automatic machines), they demolished all of the more than 40 well-constructed factory buildings and used the wood and iron frames in the buildings to construct fortifications. The nearly 150 tons of scrap copper and scrap iron that the factory had stored in the past were also completely looted. The damage to the North China Machine Factory in Zhangjiakou was even more serious. All of the factory's more than 300 large and small machines were stolen, and all the equipment in the hundred or so factory buildings has now disappeared. Among them, the more than 40 triangular iron beams in the ten or so factory buildings of the iron workshop were also dismantled one by one, and part of them were transported away. Even the indoor and outdoor electric light wires, doors, windows, tables, chairs, and the rags used to wipe the machines were all plundered. This is the whole truth about the Kuomintang bandits' looting of Zhangjiakou and Xuanhua's industry after they invaded and occupied the two places.

　　平绥路东段员工积极工作
  　迅速完成抢修任务
    张垣各企业工厂曾惨遭匪军破坏
    【张垣电】平绥铁路南口、下花园、清华园员工，在全力支援前线的号召下，克服了一切困难，迅速完成抢修任务。去年十二月我解放康庄、南口后，南口、康庄随即组织了抢修队，分赴青龙桥、沙城、康庄间抢修。经过四五天工夫，即将四里半铁路、七座桥梁修好。本来预计廿日完成的工作，由于员工们的努力，到十八日下午二时即告通车。工务段员工，不但保证了铁路的迅速修复，且于三天内完成两座公路桥梁，保证了公路的畅通。军运方面，虽然敌人逃窜时逼走一部员工，各站设备亦不完备，但在接管同志与工会同志们克服一切困难，完成抢运任务的有力动员与适当配备组织下，由于员工的积极努力，庞大的军运任务，得以顺利进行。仅二十九天的统计，即抢运二万七千八百余吨。过去南口本无调度所，一切车辆均由北平调度；为适应繁忙的军运情况，成立了调度所。运输段原有员工一百九十一人，现只九十六人；南口车站原有一零五人，现仅六十九人，但车行最多时每日上下行竟达四十三、四次之多，比国民党统治时设备最完备，全线通车时（约每日三十次）还多几次。
    【张垣电】国民党匪帮盘问张垣、宣化两年余的时间内，对于工业之破坏甚属严重。一九四六年十月初旬，国民党匪军从东西两线，以九个军兵力向张垣合犯时，以掠取张、宣两地工业设备及物资为其主要目的，当时我民主政府与人民解放军，为了维护此种国家重要财产，曾于忍痛撤退前，不顾匪机之轰炸、扫射，将前宣化龙烟铁矿所属机械厂，内有新华机器制造厂及张垣华北机器厂等厂部分机械运至解放区内，使之继续为人民生产。国民党匪军于侵陷张、宣两地后，对于两地轻、重工业机器恣意拆散、盗运，此种破坏，在十一月初解放军进军平绥前线，达于顶点。据可靠统计，张、宣两地遭到破坏者，计有宣化之新华机器厂、新华炼铁厂、龙烟铁矿所属机械厂、耐火砖工厂、张垣华北机器厂等被其盗走之各厂机械，如元车、六角车、刨床、机床及电动机、电锤、制磷炉、制钢炉、锅炉等，总数达四百部以上，另有生铁、钢板、铁板、钢棍、铁棍二千三百三十余吨。就中宣化之新华机器厂与张垣之华北机器厂，所受破坏最为严重，而上述两厂，适为此塞上两大工业都市全部机器工业之精华。国民党匪徒于盗走宣化新华机械厂全部机械后（该厂机器大部为新式自动机），复将四十余间建筑完善之厂房，全部拆毁，将房中木材、铁架，用以构筑工事，该厂昔日储存之近一百五十吨废铜、烂铁亦被其搜罗净尽。张垣华北机器厂，遭受破坏之情形更为严重，该厂大小机器三百余部，悉被盗走，数约百余间厂房内的一切设备，今已荡然无存。其中铁工部十余间厂房四十余根三角铁梁，亦一一被其拆除，部分被运走，甚至连室内外电灯线、门窗、桌、椅以及擦洗机器之烂布无一不在其掠夺之列，这就是国民党匪徒们在侵陷张、宣两地后，洗劫张、宣工业之全部真象。
