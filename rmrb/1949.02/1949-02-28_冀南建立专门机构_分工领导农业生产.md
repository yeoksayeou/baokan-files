(Southern Hebei Dispatch) To meet the needs of launching a large-scale production campaign this year, the Southern Hebei Administrative Office is actively and effectively carrying out work on establishing and improving agricultural leadership organizations. The first step is to establish state-owned professional organizations that are enterprise-oriented in nature and operate through unified management and decentralized administration, working in an organized and planned manner according to the instructions of higher authorities. Due to the characteristics of Southern Hebei, promoting cotton planting and developing water conservancy are two major priorities in production work. The Southern Hebei Cotton Production Promotion Agency and the Water Conservancy Promotion Agency have been initially established. Based on the existing foundation, a forestry company will be established in Chengci and En counties respectively. A ranch will be established in Yongbei. To create windbreaks in sandy wasteland, it is planned to establish a nursery in each of the counties of Chengci, En, Yuanchao, Qiu, Wucheng, Yongnian, Guangzong, and Zaoqiang, and each county will also establish one. A veterinary hospital will be established in Linqing, a veterinary station will be established in each prefecture, and a branch station will be established in each county district to handle livestock epidemic prevention and breeding work. A large-scale factory for manufacturing improved agricultural implements will be established. The second step is to establish and improve administrative leadership organizations at all levels. The Agriculture Department of the Administrative Office will have an Agricultural Administration Section, a Production Cooperation Guidance Section, a Forestry and Animal Husbandry Section, a Technology Promotion Section, and a Water Conservancy Section. In addition, a farm will be established in each of Linqing and Handan, and the farms will have a New Technology Promotion Team of 30 people. Each county government will have an Agriculture Section, and Water Conservancy and Forestry and Animal Husbandry Sections can be added as needed. If the need is not great, a Water Conservancy or Forestry and Animal Husbandry clerk can be appointed. If conditions permit, each county can also establish a farm. Thirdly, regarding leadership relations and scope of work, all professional organizations are under the leadership of the Agriculture Department. All levels of farms must be responsible for demonstrating and promoting superior varieties and new technologies, and training technical cadres. Fourth, each agricultural leadership organization stationed in towns and cities will establish farmer reception centers, responsible for promotion and publicity work, teaching farmers scientific planting methods, helping farmers purchase agricultural implements and other things, answering all farmers' questions, and helping farmers solve difficulties as much as possible. Currently, the work of establishing professional organizations and agricultural leadership organizations in various counties is progressing actively.

　　冀南建立专门机构
    分工领导农业生产
    【冀南电】适应今年开展大生产运动的需要，冀南行政公署关于建立和健全农业领导机构的工作，正在积极有效的进行。首先是建立国营的专业组织，性质上是企业化，方法上是统一经营、分散管理，有组织有计划的根据上级指示进行工作。由于冀南的特点，推广植棉、发展水利，是生产工作中的两大重点，现冀南区棉产推进社、水利推进社已初步建立。根据旧有的基础，在成磁、恩县各建立一个林业公司。在永北创办一个牧场。为在沙荒地带造防风林，拟在成磁、恩县、元朝、邱县、武城、永年、广宗、枣强等县各建立一个苗圃，各县亦均建立。在临清建立一个兽医院，各专区各建立一个兽医站，各县区建立分站；兼办家畜防疫和配种工作。建立一个规模较大的改良农具制造工厂。其次是建立和健全各级行政领导机构。行署农业处下设农业行政科、生产合作指导科、林牧科、技术推广科、水利科；另在临清、邯郸各设一个农场，农场设新技术推广队三十人。各县政府设农业科，根据需要可增设水利科、林牧科，如需要不大，可设水利或林牧科员。如条件具备，各县亦得设立农场。再次是领导关系和工作范围，各专业组织均受农业处领导。各级农场均须负责优良品种及新技术的示范推广，训练培养技术干部。第四、各农业领导机构驻在城镇建立农民招待所，负责推广宣传工作，教给农民科学的种植方法，帮助农民购买农具及其他东西，解答农民的一切问题，尽可能帮助农民解决困难。现各专业组织及各县建立农业领导机构的工作都正积极进行。
