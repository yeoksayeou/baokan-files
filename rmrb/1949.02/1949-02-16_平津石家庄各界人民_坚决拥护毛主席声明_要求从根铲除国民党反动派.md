Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 14th: People from all walks of life in Beiping, Tianjin, and Shijiazhuang warmly support Chairman Mao's eight proposals and denounce the peace conspiracy of the Kuomintang reactionaries. In a telegram to Chairman Mao, more than 30,000 workers in Beiping at the "February 7th" Memorial Meeting said: "We resolutely support your statement on the current situation on January 14th, strive for genuine peace and oppose false peace, and fight for the establishment of a new Beiping and a new China!" The declaration issued by students from major and secondary schools in Beiping emphasized: "Only by following Mr. Mao Zedong's eight conditions can we achieve peace; anything else is a deception." The Beiping Branch of the All-China Women's Federation issued a declaration stating: "The eight peace conditions proposed by Chinese Communist leader Mr. Mao on January 14th are the conditions for peace unanimously demanded by the people. They should be fully implemented without any discount. Otherwise, it is condoning evil." The Joint Committee of Faculty, Staff, and Police of Various Colleges and Universities in Beiping issued a statement on the current situation: "Resolutely support the eight conditions put forward by Chairman Mao of the Chinese Communist Party!" "The Chinese people will not allow any discount, and the punishment of war criminals must be strictly enforced." In addition to issuing a declaration on the current situation on the 8th, expressing their support for the eight peace proposals, professors, lecturers, instructors, and teaching assistants from Nankai and Beiyang Universities in Tianjin have aroused widespread discussion. Professor Zhang Guofan, head of the Physics Department of Beiyang University, said: "It was the Kuomintang who destroyed the resolutions of the Political Consultative Conference, and it was also the Kuomintang who launched the civil war. They should be fully responsible for this war." He said: "Today, we must not only overthrow the reactionaries, but also eradicate them from the root." Professor Liu Zhixiang, head of the Mining Department of the university, pointed out: Chiang Kai-shek's so-called "retirement" and "peace" are a delaying tactic, and we must be vigilant to prevent his comeback. Mr. Ma Ziqiang, a lecturer in the Department of Chinese Literature, and Mr. Zhang Chongnian, a lecturer in the Department of Physics, both advocated severely punishing war criminals. They pointed out that Hu Shih is a "guy who kills without shedding blood," and Chen Xueping has repeatedly massacred and arrested patriotic youths and should not be condoned. Professor Xiao Caiyu of the Biology Department of Nankai University said: "It is a good thing that Fu Zuoyi was able to accept the eight peace conditions of the Chinese Communist Party, so that Beiping was liberated; at the same time, it also pointed out an example for other unliberated cities. If the Nanjing government is truly sincere about peace, it should immediately accept the eight peace conditions put forward by the Chinese Communist Party." The people of Shijiazhuang, in their own personal experience, have recognized the Kuomintang reactionaries' consistent deception of the people and their tricks of playing with peace conspiracies. Wang Laishun, a young worker at the Flourishing Yarn Factory, recounted his painful experience of being conscripted into the Kuomintang army twice when discussing the current situation, telling everyone: "I personally suffered from the Kuomintang reactionaries' harm to the people. They will not give peace to the people. We must not be fooled!" Woman Zheng Xiangjie said: "My mother's family is from the old liberated area of ​​Zhengding County. In the year Japan surrendered, we talked to the Kuomintang about peace. The people held meetings everywhere to celebrate and happily went to the border areas to promote it. While walking on the road, just east of Gaojiadian Village in our county, they were shot back by the Kuomintang army, and many people were killed and injured. This is the 'peace' that the Kuomintang is talking about!" Zhang Kuanxin, a shop assistant at Guifu Auto Repair Shop, said: "The reactionaries used American planes to indiscriminately bomb Shijiazhuang, killing many people. More than a dozen of my business houses were all destroyed, and a shop assistant was also killed. They are the mortal enemies of the common people. How could they talk about peace with the people? If we want to talk about peace, we must first settle the blood debts with Chiang Kai-shek and his kind."

　　平津石家庄各界人民
  　坚决拥护毛主席声明
    要求从根铲除国民党反动派
    【新华社陕北十四日电】北平、天津、石家庄各界人民热诚地拥护毛主席的八项主张，斥责国民党反动派的和平阴谋。北平三万多职工在“二七”纪念大会上向毛主席致敬的电文里说：“我们坚决拥护一月十四日你对时局声明，争取真和平反对假和平，为建立一个新北平、新中国而奋斗！”北平各大中小学学生发表的宣言中着重指出：“只有循着毛泽东先生的八项条件，才是获致和平的道路，此外都是骗局。”中国妇女联谊会北平分会发表宣言称：“一月十四日中国共产党领袖毛先生所提出的八项和平条件，才是人民一致要求和平的条件。应该不折不扣的全部实现。否则就是姑息养奸”。北平市各院校教职工警联席会发表关于时局的声明：“坚决地拥护中共毛主席所提出的八项条件！”“中国人民不容许有任何的折扣，惩处战犯尤其要严格执行”。天津南开、北洋大学教授、讲师、教员、助教除已于八日发表了对时局宣言表示拥护八项和平主张外，并引起广泛谈论。北洋大学物理系主任张国藩教授说：“破坏政协决议的是国民党，发动内战的也是国民党，他们应对此次战争负完全责任。”他说：“今天不仅要打倒反动派，而且要从根予以铲除。”该校采矿系主任刘之祥教授指出：蒋介石宣告的所谓“引退”和“和平”是一种缓兵之计，我们要提高警惕，以防其卷土重来。国文系讲师马自强先生、物理系讲师张崇年先生，均主张严惩战犯。他们指出胡适是“杀人不见血的家伙”，陈雪屏曾屡次屠杀和逮捕爱国青年，决不应宽纵。南开大学生物系教授萧采瑜先生说：“傅作义能够接受中共的八项和平条件，使北平得到了解放，这是很好的；同时对于其他未解放的城市，也指出了一个榜样。如果南京政府真有和平的诚意，那就应该立即接受中共所提出的八项和平条件。”石家庄人民，在自己的亲身经历中，已认清了国民党反动派一贯欺骗人民及其玩弄和平阴谋的花样；繁荣纱厂青年工人王来顺，在座谈时局时，讲述自己两次被国民党抓去当兵的苦痛经历，告诉大家：“国民党反动派坑害人民，我是亲自尝受了，他不会给人民和平，咱们不能上他的当！”妇女郑香姐说：“俺娘家是正定县老解放区的，日本投降那年，咱给国民党谈和平，老百姓到处开会庆祝，高兴地到边沿区去宣传，走在道上，就在俺县高家店村东边，被国民党军队开枪打回来，死伤了好多人，这就是国民党所讲的‘和平’！”贵福车店的伙友张宽心说：“反动派用美国飞机，滥炸石家庄，炸死了好多人，俺做买卖的十几间房子，全炸毁了，还炸死了一个伙计，他们是老百姓的死对头，那里会对百姓谈和平，要谈和平，也得先给蒋介石孬种们算算血债。”
