　　Correcting Barbaric Treatment Methods
　　Yang Fulan (female) of Fenshuiling Village, Seventh District, Wuxiang, contracted syphilis two months after giving birth. Her body was weak, and she asked doctor Gao Xiwen to treat her. This doctor used sulfur and mercury to fumigate the nostrils of anyone with syphilis. It is said that he had cured several people using this method in the past. This time, treating Yang Fulan's illness in this way not only failed to cure her, but killed her. Such treatment is harmful and should be improved by doctors in various places. The government should also strictly educate and stop this harmful medical practice that kills people.
　　　　　　　(Wang Zhaoxiang, Wu Airong, Li Zenghua)
　　Regarding the matter of Yang Fulan of Fenshuiling Village, Seventh District, Wuxiang, being fumigated to death with mercury and sulfur by Gao Xiwen, we have the following opinions:
　　(1) Did Yang Fulan suffer from syphilis? How was it diagnosed? If she was indeed diagnosed with syphilis, did she also have other diseases? Because these questions are most important. Only with a correct diagnosis can the treatment be effective. How Gao Xiwen made the diagnosis should be investigated.
　　(2) Using mercury and sulfur to treat syphilis has long been considered a barbaric treatment method by the medical community. It is generally recognized that 606 or 914 are the most scientific and safe treatments for syphilis. Regardless of whether Yang Fulan had syphilis or not, the mercury and sulfur fumigation method is an outdated treatment. Moreover, whether it was syphilis or whether it was combined with other diseases is still questionable.
　　(3) It is hoped that the Wuxiang Medical Association or the Medical Cooperative will carefully study this issue, greatly improve their diagnostic techniques, adopt scientific methods, abandon the old and unreasonable treatments, and truly make folk medical methods scientific in order to protect people's health.

　　纠正野蛮治疗方法
    武乡七区分水岭村杨富兰（女）因刚产后两个月，染上杨梅毒，身体不强，请医生高希文医治，该医生一碰见杨梅病就采用硫磺水银在鼻孔里熏，据说过去他应用这种办法曾治好几个人，这次给杨富兰医治此病，不但没有将病治好，反而把人熏死了。这样治病，害人不浅，值得各地医生注意改进，政府亦应严格教育制止这种误害人命医法。
  　　　　　　　（王肇祥、武爱荣、李增华）
    关于武乡七区分水岭村杨富兰经高希文用水银硫磺熏死一事，我们有以下意见：
    （一）杨富兰是否患梅毒？怎样诊断的？如果确诊为梅毒，是否还合并其他病症？因为这些问题最重要，诊断正确了，治疗才会有效，高希文是如何诊断的应加以研究。
    （二）用水银硫磺治梅毒，早已被医界认为是野蛮疗法，一般公认以六○六或九一四为驱梅最科学而安全疗法，无论杨富兰是否为梅毒，水银硫磺熏法即为过时代的疗法，况是否为梅毒或是否合并其他病尚成疑问。
    （三）希望武乡医联会或医药合作社要悉心研究这一问题，很好的提高自己的诊断技术，并采用科学法，抛弃旧的不合理的疗法，切实使民间的医疗法科学化，以保障人民健康。
