Xinhua News Agency, East China, 18th: Hai'an County, Northern Jiangsu (established as a county due to its location near a town, northwest of Rugao), has provided active solutions in curbing the opportunistic restoration of feudal forces and effectively safeguarding the vested interests of liberated farmers after the completion of land reform. In some districts and townships of Hai'an County, during the correction of certain "leftist" deviations in land reform in the first half of 1948, the lack of thorough policy education led some cadres to mistakenly believe that distributing land was a mistake, and they dared not stop the restoration activities of landlords and rich peasants. Due to a lack of leadership, poor and landless peasants also showed timidity and dared not rise up to protect their legitimate interests obtained in the land reform. In the Qiuhu and Shagang districts of the county, landlords and rich peasants continuously used various means to encroach upon farmland and houses from poor and landless peasants, secretly collect rent, reclaim floating wealth, and sabotage production, among other illegal activities. In the Lianhe Village of Wulie Township, Qiuhu District, Shi Baofa, a rich peasant who had served as a puppet Baochang (local security officer) before, had two mu of land distributed to Xie Yinyu, the militia company commander, during the land reform. After Xie was dismissed for poverty and corruption, Shi instigated his nephew to seize the land from Xie and also seized the two mu of land that Xie had been allocated from another household. After this incident occurred, the village chief knew about it but did not deal with it.颜颜家深, a rich peasant in Qiuxi Town, asked Xu Guozhi, a farmer who had received land, for one shi of wheat rent during the wheat harvest. Xu did not give it because he had no grain. During the rice harvest, Yan finally used intimidation to force Xu to share it equally with him. Yan also falsely reported that he was having financial difficulties and asked the village and township cadres for land. Lu Changru, the township head, mistakenly gave him three mu of land belonging to Chen Jiayou, a farmer who had received land, and compensated Chen with four mu of wasteland. In Zhuwang Township, Shagang District, five landlords also moved back to their original residences without authorization. Peng Mingren, a landlord in Tiesuo Village, Zhouyang Township, deliberately damaged his own cart shed and complained everywhere in order to move back to his original residence; after moving back, he used the pretext of borrowing to exchange his dou (a unit of dry measure) and scales from Guo Qinglong, a poor peasant; and he demanded two shi of rent from Peng Baohou, who had received two mu of his land. Some landlords even engaged in activities that undermined the people's production when they became farmers. Zhou Tong, a rich peasant in Tiesuo Village, secretly irrigated their fields from the river at night when everyone was busy draining water to plant wheat. In Xinmin Village, Jiqing Township, Huji District, when wheat was being planted, Zhang Wancai, a rich peasant, secretly sowed wild oats in the field of Gong Ronghai, a poor peasant. After Gong discovered it and reported it to the farmers' association, Zhang admitted that he had planned to save seven or eight sheng (a unit of dry measure) of wild oats when harvesting wheat, intending to sabotage others. The above situation has attracted the attention of the county and district leading organs and is being effectively corrected. In its instructions to districts and townships, the Hai'an County Committee of the Communist Party of China emphasized that the following three points must be done well: (1) It is necessary to clearly explain the land reform policy of eliminating the feudal exploitation system and the production policy of getting rich through labor to cadres at all levels, Communist Party members, and the broad masses of farmers, publicize government decrees that protect the vested interests of farmers, and make it clear that anyone who infringes upon or damages the land and property of liberated farmers is committing a crime and will be subject to legal sanctions. It is necessary to educate cadres and Communist Party members to enhance their class vigilance, promptly deal with existing problems and expose the restoration conspiracies of feudal forces, and enlighten the awareness of the masses of farmers in order to consolidate the achievements of land reform. (2) Mobilize the masses to struggle against landlords and rich peasants who have already collected rent and encroached upon fields and houses, so that they can openly admit their mistakes and return the fields, houses, grain, etc. they have encroached upon to poor and landless peasants. (3) Intensify the education and transformation of landlords and rich peasants, and urge them to engage in labor and production. Point out that labor is their only way out.

　　及时制止封建势力复辟
  　巩固土地改革成果
    海安县提供了解决办法
    【新华社华东十八日电】在已经完成土地改革的苏北海安县（因镇设县，在如皋西北），在制止封建势力的乘机复辟与切实保障翻身农民的既得利益方面，提供了积极解决的办法。海安县有些区乡，由于一九四八年上半年纠正土地改革中的某些左倾偏向时，没有深入地进行政策教育，于是有的干部误认为分土地是做错了，对地主富农的复辟活动不敢制止。由于缺乏领导，贫雇农也表现畏缩，不敢起来保护在土地改革中获得的正当利益。该县仇湖、沙岗等区连续发生地主富农利用各种手段向贫雇农侵占田地房屋、暗中收租、索回浮财、破坏生产等不法行为。在仇湖区五烈乡联合村，曾做过伪保长的富农史宝发、有二亩田在土地改革时分给民兵中队长谢银余，谢因贫污被撤职后，史即煽动自己的堂侄向谢夺田，并把谢分得别家的二亩田也一并夺去。此事发生后，村长知道了也未加处理。仇西镇富农颜家深，麦收向得田户许国之要麦租一石，许以无粮未给。收稻时颜终于用吓骗手段迫许同他平分。颜又谎报生活困难，向村乡干部要田，该乡乡长陆长如就错误地把得田户陈加友的三亩田给他，而另补四亩荒地给陈。沙岗区朱王乡亦有五家地主擅自搬回原住地。周杨乡铁索村地主彭明仁故意把自己住的车蓬弄坏，到处向人诉苦，好搬回原住地；搬回后，复向贫农郭庆隆以借用为名换回斗、秤等；并向得他二亩田的彭宝候索取二石租子。有些地主当农竟进行破坏人民生产的活动。铁索村富农周同，当大家忙着出水种麦时，他却在夜里偷偷地由河里向他们的田里灌水。胡集区吉庆乡新民村正当种麦时，富农张万才偷偷地把雀儿麦撒在贫农龚荣海田里。龚发现后报告农会，张承认是在收麦时有计划地收留了七、八升雀儿麦，准备破坏别人的。以上情事发生后，已引起县区领导机关的注意，并切实进行纠正。中共海安县委向区乡发出的指示中，强调必须作好以下三点：（一）要明确地向各级干部、共产党员与广大农民说明消灭封建剥削制度的土地改革政策和劳动发家的生产政策，宣传保障农民既得利益的政府法令，明确指出任何人侵犯或破坏翻身农民的土地财产就是犯罪，遭受到法律制裁。要教育干部和共产党员提高阶级警惕性，及时处理已发生的问题和揭露封建势力的复辟阴谋，启发农民群众的觉悟，以巩固土地改革的成果。（二）对已经收租侵占田屋的地主富农发动群众斗争，要他们当众坦白承认错误，使其将所侵占的田、屋、粮食等退还贫雇农。（三）要加紧封地主富农的教育改造，督促其劳动生产。指出只有劳动才是他们的唯一出路。
