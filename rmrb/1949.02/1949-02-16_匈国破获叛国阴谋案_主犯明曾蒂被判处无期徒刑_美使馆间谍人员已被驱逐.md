Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 14th: Reports from various sources: Hungary recently uncovered an anti-people treasonous conspiracy case. The chief culprit, Bishop Mindszenty, after interrogation, was found guilty of six counts, including treason, speculation, and smuggling foreign currency out of the country. He was sentenced to life imprisonment on February 8th. The chairman of the Catholic Party, Barankovics, who actively supported the reactionary activities of the Mindszenty group and was involved in several major anti-people criminal cases, has absconded with the party's funds, under the protection of Stasie, the Vice-Consul of the United States in Budapest. In response, the party leader issued a statement on the 5th, stating that the party should be held responsible for Barankovics' escape. Therefore, the party's leading body has decided to dissolve the party and cease publication of the party's newspaper, "Hazánk." U.S. Vice-Consul Stasie and U.S. Embassy Secretary Korsak have been expelled from the country for the crimes of espionage and smuggling fleeing traitors. In an attempt to conceal their involvement in conspiracies against the Hungarian People's Republic, the American reactionaries are agitating the people in the United States, attempting to stir up a movement against the Hungarian Republic. U.S. Minister to Hungary Chapin made an unreasonable "protest" after unsuccessfully demanding to send personnel to attend and "observe" the trial of Bishop Mindszenty. After Bishop Mindszenty was sentenced, the U.S. House of Representatives, Senate, Acheson, Truman, and all reactionary figures successively issued "protests" and "condemnations." Both the House and Senate decided to submit this issue to the next session of the United Nations. However, these "protests" will not only fail to intimidate the Hungarian people, but will only further expose the crimes of American imperialism in attempting to interfere in the internal affairs of other countries.

　　匈国破获叛国阴谋案
  　主犯明曾蒂被判处无期徒刑
    美使馆间谍人员已被驱逐
    【新华社陕北十四日电】各方报导：不久以前，匈牙利曾破获一件反人民的叛国阴谋案。主犯明曾蒂主教，经审讯犯有叛国、投机、私运外币出境等六项罪状，已于二月八日被判处无期徒刑。积极支持明曾蒂集团的反动活动，并与若干重大的反人民罪案有关的天主教党主席巴兰柯维区，已卷带该党款项，在美国驻布达佩斯副领事史塔西掩护之下，潜逃出境。该党领袖为此于五日发表声明称：该党应对巴兰柯维区逃走一事负责，因此该党领导机关业已决定将该党解散，并停止出版该党机关报“哈查卡”报。美国副领事史塔西与美国公使馆秘书柯萨克，则因间谍与私运叛国分子潜逃的罪状，已被驱逐出境。为图掩饰自己参与反对匈牙利人民民主共和国阴谋活动的行为，美国反动派正在美国蛊惑人民，企图借此掀起一个反对匈牙利共和国的运动。美国驻匈公使卓平曾因强求派员列席“观察”明曾蒂主教的审判未遂而提出无理的“抗议”。明曾蒂主教被判决以后，美国众院、参院、艾奇逊、杜鲁门以及一切反动人物纷纷发表“抗议”与“谴责”。参众两院并决定将此问题提交联合国下届会议。但这些“抗议”不但吓不倒匈牙利人民，而且只有更加暴露美帝国主义企图干涉他国内政的罪恶。
