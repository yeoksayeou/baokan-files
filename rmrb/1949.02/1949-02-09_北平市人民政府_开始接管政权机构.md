　　Beiping Municipal People's Government
  　Begins Taking Over Political Institutions
    [Xinhua News Agency, Beiping, 7th] The Beiping Municipal People's Government has begun taking over political institutions. Ye Jianying, Director of the Beiping Military Control Commission and Mayor, and Xu Bing, Deputy Mayor, went to the former Kuomintang Municipal Government in Zhongnanhai on the afternoon of the 4th. They successively convened a meeting of all staff members of the former Kuomintang Municipal Government and a meeting of the directors and chiefs of various bureaus and offices, announcing that all personnel should stay at their posts and prepare to handle handover procedures according to the original system. To take care of the difficult living conditions of the staff, the Beiping Municipal People's Government has decided to temporarily issue half a month's living allowance. Mayor Ye said in his speech to all the staff members of the former Municipal Government: This liberation of Beiping is a revolution. It is the victory of the people, and it is absolutely different from the mutual alternation of power between the ruling classes in the past. Mayor Ye pointed out: The peaceful liberation of Beiping is the result of the victory of the powerful People's Liberation Army on the national battlefield, especially the capture of Tianjin, Zhangjiakou, and other places and the large-scale elimination of the Kuomintang army. It is also the result of the Beiping people's resolute support for genuine democracy and peace and their pressure on those who attempted to resist stubbornly. Mayor Ye said: The People's Liberation Army is the army of the people, and the government of the liberated areas is the government of the people. Personnel working in the people's government should serve the people and must never ride on the backs of the people, making the people serve their personal interests. All the fraudulent, oppressive, and exploitative practices of the past reactionary government must be thoroughly eliminated. Now is a new era of the people, and the government has new tasks, which require new people and a new style. Therefore, every staff member should re-educate themselves, transform themselves, and become a new person, that is, a person who serves the masses of the people. At the same time, a new style should be established, namely, a democratic style. Everyone can and should conduct open criticism and self-criticism of any matter or any other person's shortcomings and mistakes, including their own. Mayor Ye encouraged all staff members to give full play to their talents and work together to establish a new atmosphere for the Beiping Municipal People's Government and build a new Beiping.

　　北平市人民政府
  　开始接管政权机构
    【新华社北平七日电】北平市人民政府已开始接管政权机构。北平市军管会主任兼市长叶剑英、副市长徐冰四日下午同赴中南海原国民党市政府，先后召开原国民党市政府全体工作人员大会及各局、处长会议，宣布所有人员应各守岗位，并按照原有系统准备办理移交手续。为照顾职工生活困难、北平市人民政府决定暂发半个月的生活维持费。叶市长在对原市政府全体工作人员训话时说：这次北平的解放，是一个革命。是人民的胜利，和以往统治阶级间政权的互相交替，绝不相同。叶市长指出：北平市以和平方式解放，是强大的人民解放军在全国战场上的胜利，特别是攻克天津、张家口等地并大量消灭国民党军的结果，也是北平人民坚决拥护真正的民主和平并对企图顽抗者施以压力的结果。叶市长谈：解放军是人民的军队，解放区的政府是人民的政府。在人民的政府里工作的人员，应该为人民服务，绝不能骑在人民头上，要人民为自己个人服役。过去反动政府的一切欺诈、压迫、剥削人民的作风，必须彻底扫除。现在是新的人民的时代，政府有新的任务，就需要新的人物和新的作风。因此每一个工作人员应该重新教育自己，改造自己，使自己成为一个新的人物，即为人民群众服务的人物。同时应该树立一种新的作风，即民主的作风。每一个人对任何一件事或任何一个旁人的与自己的缺点和错误，都可以并且应该进行公开的批评与知我批评。叶市长勉励一切工作人员要发挥自己的才智，群策群力，以树立北平市人民政府的新风气，建设新北平。
