Criticism and Suggestions

To the Editor:

　　In early January, we hired five horse-drawn carts from the Taihang Jin Feng Transport Company (publicly owned) in Changzhi to go to Handan. Many problems occurred along the way, and I have the following suggestions for them:

　　First, their style is not upright, and their work efficiency is too low. On the eve of departure, we agreed with them to set off at six o'clock the next morning, but they temporarily took on three more carts of goods to travel with our five carts. As a result, we waited for nearly ten hours, and only left Changzhi at about three o'clock in the afternoon.

　　Secondly, the staff (such as the coachmen) are irresponsible in their work and very selfish, which leads to their inability to complete the task. For example, when loading the carts, they loaded as little as possible to make themselves comfortable. When traveling, they rested early and got up late, and they averaged less than forty li per day (private carts travel more than one hundred li). Every morning, we had to urge them again and again before they reluctantly got up. The most serious thing is the poor mutual assistance. One team of carts did not take care of each other. On the first day, two carts fell behind due to insufficient mule power, and the captain almost lost two front teeth. On the mountain, because the road was slippery and difficult to walk, we repeatedly advised each other to help each other and go downhill one by one, but they didn't care. As a result, one cart overturned and almost crushed a mule to death! And another coachman slipped and was run over by the cart, his life is in danger!

　　We feel that the company is the people's cause, and the employees should also work with revolutionary spirit. The coachmen should be educated and trained, and they should cherish the carts and horses and abide by discipline. This will avoid unnecessary sacrifices and complete the task. In order to improve the management of state-owned enterprises in our liberated areas, I hope the company can conduct an inspection.

### 太行晋丰运输公司应加强管理教育工作

专栏：批评与建议

　　太行晋丰运输公司应加强管理教育工作编者同志：
    一月初我们自长治雇了太行晋丰运输公司（公营）的五辆马车到邯郸，途中发生了许多问题，我对他们有如下建议：
    首先是作风不正派，工作效率太低。在动身前夕，我们和他们约定翌晨六时启程，但他们临时又揽了三车货，要和我们的五辆车作一起走，结果我们候了将近十个钟头，到下午三时许才出长治。
    其次，工作人员（如车夫）工作不负责，且非常自私，竟致不能完成任务。例如装车时他们尽量少装，以图自己轻松，行路时早休息晚起身，每日行路平均不足四十里（私人车则在百里以上），每天早晨都是我们催之再三才迟迟起床。最严重的是互助太差，一队车竟不互相照护，第一天即有两辆车因骡子力量不足而掉队，队长也几乎摔掉两颗门牙；山上因路滑难行，我们一再劝告我们互相帮忙，一辆辆的下坡，但他们毫不在意，结果翻一次车就差一点压死一个骡子。而另外一个车夫，则滑倒被车辗过，生命可危！
    我们感到，公司是人民的事业，员工们也该拿出革命的精神来工作，对车夫们尤其要加以教育和训练，要他们爱惜车马和遵守纪律，这样才可以避免无谓的牺牲和完成任务。为改善我解放区公营企业的管理，希该公司能作检查。
