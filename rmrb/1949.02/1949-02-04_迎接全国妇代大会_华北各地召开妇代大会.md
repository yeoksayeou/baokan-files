　　Welcoming the National Women's Congress
  　Women's Congresses Convened in Various Parts of North China
    [By Our Newspaper] Women in various liberated areas of North China are actively responding to the call to convene the National Women's Congress and establish the All-China Democratic Women's Federation. Women's congresses and women's work symposiums are being held successively to review and summarize women's work, elect representatives, discuss and study proposals, and actively prepare to welcome the upcoming National Women's Congress. According to a report from the Beiyue Fourth Special District Women's Federation: In mid-January, counties such as Xingtang, Pingshan, Yunshou, Fuping, Jianping, Zhengding, and Jingxing held representative meetings one after another to conduct elections. Pingshan convened its first representative congress on January 17 and elected Zhang Min and two others as representatives to attend the Beiyue Women's Congress. Xingtang completed village elections from January 6th to 20th, convened district women's representative meetings from the 13th to the 15th, and held a county women's representative meeting on the 18th, electing Yang Zhilan and eight others as standing committee members. The first Zhengding Women's Congress opened on January 18, attended by 84 representatives, most of whom were rural working women, as well as female cadres, female teachers, and female student representatives. Everyone participated in enthusiastic elections and established a women's federation. Jingxing convened its women's congress on January 16, attended by 98 representatives, of whom 69 were rural women. At the meeting, the county's women's work and current existing problems were earnestly examined, representative models were evaluated, and the congress was held for four days. The Taiyue District Women's Federation Preparatory Committee recently convened a symposium of female cadres from various agencies at the administrative office level, deciding to hold a district-wide women's representative meeting on February 1 to elect representatives, collect women's issues, and elect Huang Wei, Sang Yun, and 11 others as preparatory committee members. The Jincheng Women's Federation convened its first county-wide women's representative congress on January 13. In preparation for the convening of women's representative congresses at all levels, the Hebei-Shandong-Henan District Party Committee convened a meeting of women cadres last month. Xu Yunbei, Deputy Secretary of the District Party Committee, attended to provide guidance, conveyed the Central Committee's decision on rural women's work, reviewed and discussed the women's work in the district, and clarified the direction of the women's movement in the future. In order to welcome the National Women's Congress, the Taihang Women's Federation issued a call to women throughout the district to continue to build a new democratic society, carry forward the glorious achievements of production and support for the front in recent years, and celebrate the upcoming National Women's Congress with practical actions. The Jinzhong District Women's Federation Preparatory Committee specially notified all counties to quickly establish and improve women's congresses, establish women's federations, elect representatives, and collect women's work materials and proposals, etc., to welcome the National Women's Congress. Other areas such as Central Hebei and Southern Hebei are also holding women's meetings and actively carrying out various preparatory work.
