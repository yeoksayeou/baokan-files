　　　　I. The Attempt at Coal Gas
Since liberation, Chen Haihsui, a plumbing worker at the Tongpu Railway's Taigu Engineering Section, has felt very different. He remembers clearly the speech given by Inspector Fan at the workers' meeting on December 4th of last year: "The railways and highways of our Tongpu Railway now belong to the people themselves. From now on, everyone must try to reduce costs as much as possible and invent new things."

"Good! It's our own business, so we must do our best." Returning to the workplace, the old railway motorcycle, lying around in a disorganized state, caught Chen Haisui's attention.

"Motorcycles rely entirely on gasoline to run, which costs too much money. If we could reduce costs and use other fuels to power it, wouldn't that be even better?!" Chen Haisui thought as he estimated, and then he thought of wood-burning automobiles.

This is how the motivation for the attempt began. Once - on December 8th, 1948, Haisui took a piece of iron pipe, two inches in diameter and two and a half feet long, filled it with coal, and brought it into the blacksmith shop. "What are you doing, Old Chen!" When others asked him curiously, he smiled and didn't say anything. He put the iron pipe on the stove and started to heat it. Ten minutes later, wisps of coal smoke could be seen coming out of the end of the pipe. He took out a match and lit it, and the smoke immediately turned into lamplight. At this point, Old Chen nodded, feeling confident: "Like wood-burning cars, gas can probably also drive the railway motorcycle's prime mover!"

He was very happy this day and named the pipe he heated that day "Gas Pipe."

　　　　II. Coal Gas Furnace and Moisture Cylinders

Chen Haisui told his assistants Yu Changhe, Ma Heng, and Zhang Yunting about his plan to "replace gasoline with coal to改造 the old railway motorcycle," and they all agreed and were happy. So they began to look for scrap iron plates to experiment with making a coal gas furnace. They searched for a long time in Lingshi and Jiexiu without finding anything. Finally, they found a broken boiler half-buried in the ground and three moisture cylinders labeled A, B, and C at the Pingyao Automobile Company.

"That's it! Let's use them." After negotiating the matter, everyone brought them back to their workshop in the Taigu Engineering Section like treasures.

The tense days began! They studied and repaired during work hours, and they studied and repaired during rest periods. Adding parts! Filing! Heating! ... They were busy for a whole month before they gradually assembled the boiler, moisture cylinders, and gas pipe onto the motorcycle piece by piece.

On January 17th, the boiler was officially started, but it leaked air and couldn't be used. Chen Haisui said very firmly: "Find it! Think of another way." Old Chen's resolute words encouraged everyone's working spirit. In a few days, they finally found another coal gas furnace in the Jinfeng Automobile Company in Taigu City. They disassembled the old one and installed the newly found one.

On January 23rd, all the machinery was basically equipped. After more than ten tests, using a total of 1,300 jin of coal, the prime mover began to turn on this day.

When Chen Haisui and his assistants put a lot of effort into discovering that the old boiler, after several repairs, still leaked air and could not be used, a few people sarcastically said: "Looks like they can invent something?!" "The higher you fly, the harder you fall. What will they do if they fail?" Comrade Haisui and his companions had a firm belief as steel, they said:

"Anyway, we want to save the people some money and serve the people. If we work hard, there will always be benefits."

With the encouragement and help of the trade union, when the newly found gas furnace was installed on their motorcycle for the second time, all obstacles and sarcasm were completely overcome.

　　　　III. The Railway Motorcycle Started

February 5th was a day worth celebrating. On this day, Chen Haisui's first railway motorcycle started! Ten people: Chen Haisui, Yu Changhe, Ma Heng, and Zhang Yunting, sat happily on the car and traveled from Taigu Station to Xiangyang River at a speed of thirty-five kilometers per hour on a twelve-kilometer-long railway line. From then on, coal-fueled motorcycles began to be used on the railway.

Plumbing worker Comrade Chen Haisui is currently thirty-six years old. He is from Chenjiazhuang, Wuqiao County, Hebei Province. His family was poor, and the whole family of seventeen had only twenty acres of land. At the age of sixteen (in the 19th year of the Republic of China), he went to the Taigu Electric Light Company in Shanxi Province alone to become an apprentice. In the 26th year of the Republic of China, he entered the railway electrical section, and after a week, he transferred to the Taigu Engineering Section to work. Until Taigu was liberated in July 1948, Comrade Haisui was doing "plumbing mechanic" work. He is honest and upright, not good at talking, and good at studying. When the enemy retreated, Comrade Haisui preserved three boxes of American-made machine tools worth more than 10 million yuan. When the People's Liberation Army took over the railway, he automatically took out all the parts without missing a single one. When Chen Haisui mentioned the Communist Party and the People's Liberation Army, he smiled and gave a thumbs up, saying:

"Good! Good! Our own people, our own people!"

### 石炭铁道摩托车的诞生

　　石炭铁道摩托车的诞生
    浩然、加里
     　　　　一、石炭瓦斯的尝试
    同蒲路太谷工务段水道工人陈海水解放后的心情大不同了。他对去年十二月四日范视察员在工人大会上的讲话，记的非常牢靠：“我们同蒲路的铁道、工路都是人民自己的了，今后大家要尽量减低成本，发明创造新东西。”
    “好！自己的事，一定尽心干。”回到工作场里，四下狼籍不堪的旧铁道摩托车，吸引住了陈海水。
    “摩托车全凭汽油开动，花的钱太大了。如果能减低成本，用其他燃料把它开动起来，那不就更好吗！？”陈海水一面估计着，一面想起了木炭汽车。
    尝试的动机就这样开始了。一次——一九四八年十二月八号，海水把一根直径二英寸、长二英尺半的铁道管子，装满煤炭后，拿进铁匠厂里。“干啥呀？老陈！”当别人新奇地问他时，他笑眯眯的没说啥，就把铁道管子放在火炉上，加火烧将起来。十分钟过后，只见管头上冒出一缕缕的煤烟，掏出火柴一点，烟立刻变成灯光了，这时老陈点着头，心中有了底儿：“和木炭汽车一起，大概瓦斯也能摧动铁道摩托原动机的！”
    这天他很高兴，把当天加火烧的那根管子，定名为“瓦斯管”。
    　　　　二、石炭瓦斯炉与潮气缸
    陈海水把“石炭代替汽油，改造旧日铁道摩托车”这一计划告诉了助手于昌合、马恒、张云亭后，他们也都赞成、高兴；于是开始找废铁板，试验作石炭瓦斯炉。先在灵石，介休找了许久没找着，最后还是在平遥汽车公司里寻见一个半截身子里进土里的坏锅炉和Ａ、Ｂ、Ｃ三个潮气缸。
    “对！就用它吧。”交涉妥当后，大家象宝贝一样地把它们带回了太谷工务段自己的作坊。
    紧张的日子来了！工作时间研究修理，休息时间也研究修理；加配零件呀！挫擦呀！过火呀……，整整忙了一月，才逐渐把锅炉、潮气缸、瓦斯管一件件初步装到摩托车上面。
    一月十七号，锅炉正式开始生火，但是跑气不能用。陈海水十分坚定地说：“找！再想办法。”老陈斩钉截铁的话，鼓舞了大伙的工作勇气，没几天，终于又在太谷城晋丰汽车公司中寻到另一个石炭瓦斯炉。拆下旧的来，又把新寻来的装上去。
    一月二十三号，全部机器，大体装备完毕，前后试验十余次，共用煤炭一千三百斤，原动机在这天开始转动了。
    当陈海水和他的助手们费了很大力气，发现几经修理的旧锅炉还是跑气不能使用时，有少数人讽刺地说：“看样子吧，还象个能发明了东西的！？”“飞的高，跌的重，成功不了看他们坐下辣怎办？”海水同志和他的同伴们，信心坚定如钢，他们说：
    “反正我们是想为人民节省一笔钱，为人民服务，努力，总会有好处。”
    在职工会的鼓舞帮助下，待新寻回来的瓦斯炉二次装置上他们的摩托车时，所有一切阻碍和讽刺，完全就被克服了。
    　　　　三、铁道摩托车开动了
    二月五号，是一个值得庆贺的日子，这天陈海水们的第一辆铁道摩托车开动了！十个人：陈海水、于昌合、马恒、张云亭他们，愉快地坐在车上，由太谷站到向阳河，在长达十二公里火车路上，以每点钟三十五公里的速度顺利地驰去。从此铁道上开始使用石炭摩托车了。
    水道工人陈海水同志，现年三十六岁。河北吴桥县陈家庄人。家境贫寒，全家十七口人，仅有土地二十亩。十六岁那年（民国十九年），只身跑到山西太谷电灯公司当学徒。民国二十六年，进铁路电气段，经过一礼拜的时间即转太谷工务段工作，一直到一九四八年七月太谷解放，海水同志都是干“水道机工”活计。他为人忠厚耿直，不好说话，善钻研。敌人溃退时，海水同志保存了价值一千万元以上的三箱美造机器工具，解放军接受铁路，他没短一个零件地全部自动拿出。一提起共产党、解放军来，陈海水就笑容可掬地竖起了大姆指说：
    “好！好！自己人，自己人！”
