　　Industrial Patriotic Society—After the Japanese imperialists launched their war of aggression against China, in order to suppress the domestic workers' movement, they imitated Nazi Hitler and formed a fascist organization called the Industrial Patriotic Society. They used this organization to "unify" workers' organizations, make workers "obey" its war of aggression, and win over traitors of the Japanese workers, such as the Japanese Labor Union, to support and endorse this fascist organization. In 1940, after Konoe came to power, he disbanded the trade union organization to establish a "unified" system of the Industrial Patriotic Society. It was disbanded on September 30, 1945.
　　Puppet State—Outwardly an independent country, but in essence subordinate to a certain imperialist country, subject to the financial, economic, military, diplomatic, and internal affairs supervision of the imperialist country, and actually the same as a colony, such a country is called a puppet state, also known as a dependent state. Countries such as the Philippines, Egypt, and Panama are puppet states of the United States and Britain.

    产业报国会——日本帝国主义发动侵华战争后，为了镇压国内的工人运动，仿效纳粹希特勒组成的一个法西斯组织，叫做产业报国会。利用这个组织来“统一”工人组织，使工人“服从”它的侵略战争，并拉拢日本工人的背叛者如日本劳动组合会等来支持拥护这个法西斯组织。到一九四零年，近卫上台后，便解散工会组织，以建立“统一”的产业报国会的系统。一九四五年九月三十日被解散。
    附庸国——外表上是一个独立的国家，实质上是从属于某一帝国主义国家，受该帝国主义国家的财政经济、军事、外交及内政等的监督，实际上和殖民地一样，这样的国家叫做附庸国，又叫从属国。如菲律宾、埃及、巴拿马等国就是美英的附庸国。
