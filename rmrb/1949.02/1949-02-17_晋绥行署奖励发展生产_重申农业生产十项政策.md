Xinhua News Agency, Xing County, 15th. The Jin-Sui Administrative Office has put great effort into arranging this year's agricultural production work. As early as January 12th, it convened a regional production conference. After ten days of discussion, it determined the regional agricultural production plan for 1949. Subsequently, on January 26th, it issued a "Mobilization Order to Step Up Spring Plowing Preparations," which specifically instructed the various preparatory tasks to be done before spring plowing, calling on governments at all levels to actively lead the effort. To reward the development of agricultural production, the Administrative Office also issued special instructions, re-emphasizing ten relevant policies and guidelines for agricultural production, including: Determining land rights and guaranteeing financial rights; allowing free employment of long-term and short-term laborers; allowing tenancy relations under specific conditions; protecting and promoting private lending after the abolition of feudal usury exploitation; truly implementing the policy of collecting public grain according to fixed normal yields and the same proportion; strictly implementing fair and reasonable wartime service burden methods; rewarding production and issuing loans; advocating mutual aid in labor exchange and encouraging the establishment of cooperatives; vigorously mobilizing and organizing women to participate in agricultural production; rewarding labor models, reforming loafers, and strictly prohibiting theft, gambling, opium smoking, and other behaviors. The Jin-Sui Liberated Area suffered a severe famine in 1947. Through the efforts of the military and civilians throughout the region in 1948, a general bumper harvest was achieved, not only restoring the agricultural production level of 1946, but also exceeding the level of 1946 in some areas. However, due to the long-term destruction by the enemy and the results of years of famine, the region's production has still not recovered to the level before the War of Resistance Against Japan. According to statistics from two to three counties in northwestern Shanxi, the existing cultivated land has decreased by 20% compared to before the war, livestock has decreased by 44% compared to before the war, and land yield has decreased by 20%. Therefore, the entire region plans to strive to restore or even exceed the pre-war level within two to three years. The region plans to increase the production of fine grains by 200,000 big dan this year (calculated based on an average increase of 2 big sheng of coarse grains per mu, with each dan being 260 jin), reclaim more than 1.1 million mu of wasteland, and increase the number of cattle, donkeys, mules, and horses by 35,000 head and sheep by 150,000 head. To ensure self-sufficiency in clothing, it is planned to restore cotton fields, which had been reduced due to famine, to 200,000 mu in the old cotton-producing areas of Linxian, Lishi, Hequ, Xingxian, Baode, and Zhongyang counties, and to promote cotton planting in counties such as Guoxian and Shanyin. At the same time, special crops will be developed in a planned and focused manner. It is planned to plant 1.3 million mu of oilseeds in mountainous areas such as the Wuzhai sub-district, Yanbei sub-district, and Yannan sub-district, 30,000 mu of hemp in Linxian, Fangshan, Xingxian, and Lanxian, and more than 10,000 mu of tobacco leaves in Daixian, Baode, and Linxian, and to call on farmers to plant a large number of flax seeds. For sandy soil areas along the Yellow River that are prone to drought, the Administrative Office has formulated drought prevention measures, calling on every man, woman, and child in the local area to plant three jujube trees each year, while also advocating afforestation, planting more drought-resistant crops, building small-scale water conservancy projects, and developing Yellow River water transportation, and stipulating that various personnel be equipped along the river to specifically guide farmers in drought prevention work.

　　晋绥行署奖励发展生产
  　重申农业生产十项政策
    【新华社兴县十五日电】晋绥行署用了很大的力量来布置今年的农业生产工作。早于一月十二日起，即召开了一个全区的生产会议，经过十天的研讨，确定了一九四九年的全区农业生产计划。随于一月廿六日发布了“加紧春耕准备动员令”，具体指示了春耕前应做的各项准备工作，号召各级政府积极领导进行。为奖励发展农业生产，行署又特地发布指令，重申有关农业生产的政策方针十项，包括：确定地权，保证财权；允许自由雇佣长工、短工；允许特定条件下的租佃关系；保护与提倡在废除封建高利贷剥削后的私人借贷；确实贯彻按固定通常产量及同一比例征收的公粮政策；严格贯彻公平合理的战争勤务负担办法；奖励生产与发放贷款；提倡变工互助，奖励开办合作社；大力动员组织妇女参加农业生产；奖励劳动模范，改造二流子，严禁偷盗、赌博、吸食大烟等行为。晋绥解放区一九四七年曾遭严重灾荒，一九四八年经过全区军民的努力，获得了普遍的丰收，不仅恢复了一九四六年的农业生产水平，部分地区并超过了一九四六年的水平。但是，由于敌人的长期破坏和历年灾荒的结果，现在全区生产仍未恢复到抗日战争前的水平，据晋西北二—三个县的统计，现有耕地较战前降低百分之二十，牲畜较战前降低百分之四十四，土地产量降低百分之二十。因此，全区计划在两三年内争取恢复甚至超过战前的水平。全区今年计划增产细粮二十万大石（以每亩平均增产粗粮二大升计算，每石二百六十斤），开荒一百一十余万亩，增加牛、驴、骡、马三万五千头及羊十五万头。为保证穿衣自给，计划于临倒、离石、河曲、兴县、保德、中阳六县老产棉区，恢复曾因灾荒减少之棉田至二十万亩，并于崞县、山阴等县推广植棉。同时有计划有重点地发展特种作物，计划在五寨分区、雁北分区、雁南分区等山地种油籽一百三十万亩，在临县、方山、兴县、岚县等地种麻三万亩，在代县、保德、临县等地种烟叶上万亩，并号召农民大量种植大麻子。对于黄河沿岸易受旱灾的沙土地区，行署订出了防旱办法，号召当地每一男女老少每年栽枣树三棵，同时提倡植树造林，多种耐旱作物，兴修小型水利，发展黄河水运，并规定沿河各种配备一定人员专门指导农民防旱工作。
