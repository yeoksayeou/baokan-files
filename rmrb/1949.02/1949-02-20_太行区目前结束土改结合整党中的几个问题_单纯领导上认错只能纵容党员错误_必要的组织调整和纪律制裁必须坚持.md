If the rural Party branches are not rectified, the Party's policy of concluding land reform cannot be correctly implemented, the masses' awareness and organization cannot be further consolidated and improved, and the production movement cannot be vigorously carried out on the road of organization. This has been proven by actual movements.

The current movement is being carried out universally on the basis of combining the conclusion of land reform with Party consolidation. In order to strive for the completion of the conclusion of land reform and Party consolidation work in the vast majority of villages before the busy farming season, the following suggestions are put forward for reference:

　　First, analyze the situation, deploy forces, and strive to complete about 80% of the villages before the busy farming season.

At present, 5,120 villages in the district have completed land reform, most of which have only combined preliminary Party consolidation, a small number of which have implemented systematic Party consolidation from beginning to end, and some of which have not combined Party consolidation at all. How to combine Party consolidation and the conclusion of land reform work well and thoroughly in these villages in the next three months depends crucially on formulating specific guidelines based on different situations.

At present, there are generally four different types of villages that have completed land reform in the district. Therefore, the requirements for the content of the work vary:

Four Types of Villages, Four Methods

The first type of village: The branch itself is relatively pure, the relationship between the Party and the masses has been relatively close in history without major rifts, and the style of the cadres is relatively good. The combination of Party consolidation in the conclusion of land reform is good, criticism and self-criticism within the branch have been carried out, and some have already carried out all or part of the organizational adjustments. The ideological mobilization of the masses is relatively sufficient, and there are very few or no deviations in the conclusion of land reform policy. This type of village accounts for about 15% to 20% of the entire district. After a short period of internal and external inspection and summary movement, these villages will be issued land certificates, enter production, and announce the conclusion of land reform and Party consolidation. In the future, strengthen the leadership of the branch over the village people's congress, improve the style of work, and consolidate the Party's self-criticism system. Work under the normal leadership of the district committee.

The second type of village: The branch is impure, the historical rift between the Party and the masses is large, the style of the cadres is undemocratic, and there are even a few seriously impure elements in the branch. Preliminary Party consolidation has been carried out in the conclusion of land reform, but the internal self-criticism of the branch has been poorly developed, the ideological mobilization of the masses is not very sufficient, and there are some deviations in the implementation of the conclusion of land reform policy, but they are not very serious. This type of village accounts for about 50% of the entire district. The problem with this type of village should be to thoroughly mobilize the masses to correct deviations in the summary and inspection of the conclusion of land reform and the resolution of outstanding issues, and then issue land certificates. At the same time, promote systematic Party consolidation, fully promote democracy, and improve the awareness of Party members and the masses. Carry out systematic criticism and self-criticism within the branch and with the assistance of mass representatives, and deal with internal problems of the branch ideologically and organizationally to carry out Party building (land certificates in this type of village do not necessarily have to be issued after the completion of systematic Party consolidation).

The third type of village: The branch is seriously impure, the historical relationship between the Party and the masses is bad, and there are bad elements in the branch. Party consolidation has not been combined in the conclusion of land reform, and the conclusion of land reform has not mobilized the masses, and is still monopolized by a few cadres. Therefore, the left and right deviations in the implementation of the conclusion of land reform policy are very serious. This type of village accounts for more than 10% of the entire district. The problems in this type of village are more complicated and the tasks are still very heavy. The work should be to mobilize Party members and the masses at the same time, correct policy thinking, summarize and inspect the conclusion of land reform work, correct left and right deviations, strive to issue land certificates before the busy farming season, carry out systematic Party consolidation, carry out criticism and self-criticism within the branch, clean up bad elements from the Party, establish the democratic system of the branch, and transform the village-level leadership organization.

The fourth type of village: Land reform in the past was not thorough, and there is still a considerable amount of feudal remnants. The branch is seriously impure. This type of village is actually the foundation of the right, and the problem is to continue to complete land reform. Therefore, in this type of village, it is also necessary to fully mobilize the masses, draw a clear line between class camps, improve the awareness of the masses, thoroughly eliminate feudal remnants, and combine Party consolidation in the mobilization of the masses to continue to complete land reform. This type of village accounts for less than 10% of the entire district (most areas generally do not have this type of village).

In this way, we should allocate our forces according to our specific circumstances. In the first type of village, we should basically rely on the branch to carry out independently, and the leadership should only provide guidance and inspection. In the second type of village, we should allocate certain cadres to carry out the work, but we should adopt short meetings and rotating inspections as much as possible, and we should further analyze and study the situation, and complete this stage of work step by step. In general, we should not continue to use the current method of the work team "holding on to do it." For the third and fourth types of villages, we must assign certain forces to persist in implementation. As long as the second type of village is completed, it can be guaranteed that 80% of the villages can make achievements in this year's large-scale production movement.

　　Second, overcome the left and right deviations in Party consolidation work.

The current Party consolidation work is basically proceeding on the right track, but left and right deviations still exist more or less in the minds of some comrades, in some places, and on some issues, and there is still a need to raise them.

Why does the right deviation occur? Because some comrades only one-sidedly see that under the influence of the spring Party consolidation, Party members in many places have become passive and lying down, and the state of anarchy in the villages has developed. Therefore, they understand this deviation in methods as a deviation in policy, and lack a clear and firm understanding of the impurity of the branch. In addition, because the heavy work in winter cannot be well realized without the correct leadership of the Party branch, they are eager for these Party members to become active quickly (this is of course correct) and complete the conclusion of land reform and other tasks. However, their understanding and methods of making Party members active are wrong. They want to eliminate the complaints of Party members only by self-criticism at the leadership level. Therefore, they cannot realistically and appropriately examine the responsibilities of the leaders, but adopt a "package deal" attitude towards all the mistakes of Party members. However, the erroneous thoughts and behaviors of Party members cannot be "collected" by the leaders like "collecting goods" and then cease to exist. As a result, this kind of kowtow-style "self-criticism" did not have a good effect on promoting the enthusiasm of Party members, because the enthusiasm of Party members is based on the awareness and enthusiasm of serving the broad masses of working people. Without the improvement of awareness and the serious overcoming of mistakes, there can be no promotion of enthusiasm. At the same time, some leading cadres also have erroneous understandings of promoting the positive factors of Party members. Of course, we cannot only see the mistakes and shortcomings of Party members, but we must also see the merits and advantages of Party members, so that Party members can find ways to overcome their mistakes from the analysis of their comprehensive historical advantages and disadvantages. However, it should not be a simple praise and praise of merits, which will inevitably make Party members proud and complacent. If promoting positive factors is used to replace mistakes and resist mistakes, it will only condone the mistakes of Party members and delay their development.

Secondly, some comrades also have an error in understanding the necessity of clarifying the various impure situations such as Party membership, ideology, and behavior, and carrying out organizational transformation and disciplinary sanctions under the conditions of unfolding criticism and self-criticism within the Party in Party consolidation. They have a point of view: they believe that the only crux of all branch problems is the lack of education. Therefore, they attempt to transform everything with education. It seems that facing the foundation of our current rural branches, as long as education is added, the Party can be built into a Bolshevik party. The reason why comrades with this understanding make mistakes is because, first: they ignore the serious fact that Party membership determines consciousness, thus completely obliterating the impure side of Party membership, and lightly letting go of some seriously incurable degenerates, hooligan saboteurs, and even individual class dissidents and political dissidents, and on the contrary, pushing all problems to the leadership, which is both inconsistent with the facts and cannot be allowed. Second: Therefore, the necessary organizational transformation and disciplinary sanctions within the Party are also cancelled. In fact, many branches do not have landlord and rich peasant elements, but this does not mean that there is no need for disciplinary sanctions, especially organizational adjustments. Facts have proved that many branches, even if they generally do not need disciplinary sanctions, must undergo appropriate organizational adjustments after Party consolidation. In places where we have relatively neglected branch work in the past, this seems to be even more necessary. Third: The result of excessively emphasizing education is bound to relatively neglect ideological struggle, so that ordinary Party members relax their own mistake inspections, so that Party education lacks vivid and lively content, thus reducing the effect of education.

How does the left deviation occur? Some comrades have an empirical formula. As long as they mention the word "rectification," they understand that they must "calculate the historical mistakes of Party members for thousands of generations." Therefore, they dig out those thoughts and behaviors that have lost their practical significance and criticize and struggle against them. This retelling of old stories and reopening of old accounts does not have any benefit other than increasing the unpleasant and heavy historical burden of Party members who "cannot erase a little mistake for a lifetime." They do not pay attention to the continuous transformation in practice in Party consolidation, and deny that preliminary rectification is also a part of Party consolidation. Their understanding is that they must conduct a concentrated and thorough introspection like past cadre rectification, and launch a "great ideological movement" to rectify the Party all at once. They do not conceptually recognize those branches that have been undergoing certain Party consolidation continuously in history (such as Baiyangyu), but insist on centrally settling their mistakes again. They do not pay attention to the continuous overcoming of Party members' mistakes in practical movements, but want to wait for systematic Party consolidation. For example, when the district cadres of Tangyin went to Sanjia Village, when Party members asked for help to overcome their mistakes, the district cadres said: Now is the conclusion of land reform, not Party consolidation, let's talk about it when we consolidate the Party! The Party members were burdened, and they were not at ease in their work. He also said: If you do not work actively now, you will suffer in the future when you consolidate the Party. He regarded Party consolidation as a scare to Party members. He wanted to rely on "concentrated rectification" without continuous transformation in practical work. As a result, he could only damage the vitality of the Party and turn Party members into a group of "good old men" who were lifeless, fearful, dared not take responsibility, and lacked enthusiasm and creativity.

All these left and right deviations cannot rectify the Party well. They are all due to not understanding that they must grasp the practical problems of Party members in the branch, grasp the existing good and bad thoughts and behaviors of Party members in the branch to carry out criticism and self-criticism, promote positive factors, and overcome negative factors in order to rectify the Party well. So the results are all equally bad. Although the right deviation is more prevalent than the left deviation, it should be vigilant that the left-leaning emotions of some comrades are ambushed and will only be exposed during systematic Party consolidation. Therefore, today we must clarify the existence and development of left and right deviations ideologically. Only by constantly launching a two-line struggle on various levels of difference, different regions, and different issues can we guarantee the victorious completion of Party consolidation.

　　太行区目前结束土改结合整党中的几个问题
    单纯领导上认错只能纵容党员错误
    必要的组织调整和纪律制裁必须坚持
    区党委办公室
    对农村党的支部不加整顿，党的结束土地改革政策便不能正确实现，群众的觉悟性组织性便不能进一步巩固与提高，生产运动便不能在组织起来的道路上蓬勃开展起来，支部本身也不能提高，这已经被实际运动所证实了。
    当前的运动是在结束土地改革与整党相结合的基础上普遍的开展起来的，为了争取绝大部分村庄的结束土地改革与整党工作能在农忙之前完成，特提出以下几点意见以供参考：
  　第一、分析情况，布署力量，争取农忙前完成百分之八十左右的村庄。
    目前全区结束土地改革的村庄已达五千一百二十个村，其中大部仅仅是结合了初步整党，一小部则是自始至终贯彻了整党而完成了系统整党的，还有一部分则是完全没有结合整党的。今后如何在这将近三个月的时间内，能够把这些村整党与结束土地改革工作结合的很好而且彻底完成，则重要的关键首先决定于根据不同情况，订出具体方针。
    目前全区已经结束了土地改革的村庄，一般的存在着四种不同的类型。因此，工作内容的要求程度便有所区别：
    四类村庄四种作法
    第一类村庄：支部本身较纯洁，历史上党群关系较密切而无大裂痕，干部作风较好。在结束土地改革中结合整党较好，支部内的批评与自我批评业已开展，并且有的业已进行过全部或部分的组织调整，群众的思想发动较充分，结束土地改革的政策偏差极小或者没有发生偏差。这类村庄在全区约占百分之十五到二十，这类村庄是经过一段不长的党内外检查总结运动之后，颁发土地证，进入生产，宣布土地改革与整党的结束。今后加强支部对村人代会的领导，改进作风，巩固党内自我批评制度。在区委正常的领导之下进行工作。
    第二类村庄：支部不纯，历史上党群关系裂痕较大，干部作风不民主，甚至支部内有少数严重不纯分子存在。在结束土地改革中进行了初步整党，但支部内部的自我批评开展较差，群众的思想发动不很充分，结束土地改革的政策执行也有些偏差，但不很严重。这类村庄在全区约占百分之五十左右，这类村庄的问题，应该是在总结检查结束土地改革，解决遗留问题中，深入发动群众纠正偏向，而后颁发土地证，同时推向系统整党，充分发扬民主，提高党员与群众觉悟，在支部内部并在群众代表协助下，开展系统的批评与自我批评，并从思想上组织上处理支部内部问题，进行党的建设（这类村发土地证，不一定在系统整党完成之后）。
    第三类村庄：支部严重不纯，历史上党群关系恶劣，支部内有坏分子存在。在结束土地改革中又未结合进行整党，结束土地改革又未发动群众，仍为少数干部所包办，因此，在结束土地改革政策的执行上，左与右的偏差均很严重。这类村庄，在全区约占百分之十以上。这类村庄的问题较复杂，任务还很繁重。其工作应该是发动支部党员同时发动群众，端正政策思想，总结检查结束土地改革工作，纠正左右偏向，争取农忙前颁发土地证，进行系统整党，开展支部内的批评与自我批评，清洗坏分子出党，建立支部的民主制度，改造村级领导组织。
    第四类村庄：过去土地改革不彻底，封建尾巴还有相当数量的存在，支部严重不纯，这类村庄实际上是右的基础，是继续完成土地改革的问题。因此，在这类村庄，还需要充分发动群众，划清阶级阵营，提高群众觉悟，彻底消灭封建尾巴，并在发动群众继续完成土地改革中，结合进行整党。这类村庄在全区约占不及百分之十（大部地区则一般不存在）。
    这样，我们就应该根据自己的具体情况，将力量加以分配，在一类村庄，基本上要依靠支部去独立进行，领导上只加以指导检查即可。第二类村庄分配一定的干部去进行，但应多采取简短会议与轮番检查的办法，并应再加以分析研究，有步骤的完成这一段工作，而一般的不能再沿用目前的工作组“把着干”的办法。对于第三、四类村，则必需放一定的力量去坚持贯彻。只要第二类村庄进行完了，便可保证百分之八十的村庄能在今年的大生产运动中做出成绩来。
  　第二、克服整党工作中的左右偏向
    目前的整党工作，基本上是在正确的轨道上进行着的，但是左与右的偏向在某些同志的思想中，在某些地方，某些问题上还或多或少的存在着，现在还有加以提出的必要。
    为什么会发生右的偏向呢？因为有些同志，他们只是片面的看到在春季整党及其影响之下，许多地方的支部党员消极躺倒了，村中的无政府状态发展了，于是他们把这种方法上的偏差了解为方针的偏差，而对支部不纯却缺乏明确而坚定的认识。另外，由于冬季繁重的工作，离开了党的支部的正确领导便不能很好实现，所以他们又急于要这些支部党员很快积极起来（这当然是对的），完成结束土地改革以及其他各种工作。但是，如何使党员积极起来，他们的认识与采取的方法错误了。他们想只用领导上的自我批评来消除党员的牢骚情绪，于是便不能实事求是的，恰如其分的检讨领导者的责任，而是对一切党员的错误采取“大包干”的态度，然而，党员的错误思想与行为并不能象“收货”一样，被领导者“收”走便不复存在了。结果，这样磕头式的“自我批评”，对发扬党员的积极性并没有起了好的效果，因为党员的积极性是建筑在为广大劳动人民服务的觉悟与热情之上的，没有觉悟的提高和对错误的认真克服，便不能有积极性的发扬。同时，部分领导干部对发扬党员积极因素的了解也是有错误的。固然我们不能只看到党员的错误、缺陷，而必须也看到党员的功绩与优点，从而使党员从自己全面的历史的优缺点的分析中，寻找克服自己错误的道路，但不应该是单纯的表扬歌颂功绩，这将必然使党员骄傲自满起来。如果把发扬积极因素是用作来代替错误，抵触错误，便只有纵容党员的错误拖延发展下去。
    其次，有些同志对于整党中必须在展开党内批评与自我批评为中心的条件下，弄清党内成份、思想、行为等各种不纯的情况，加以组织改造和纪律制裁的这种必要，也有着不容忽视的错误了解。他们有一种论点：认为一切支部问题，惟一的症结，就是缺乏教育。因之，则企图用教育去改造一切，似乎面对着我们当前的农村支部的基础，只要加上教育，便可以把党建设成为布尔什维克的党了。有这种认识的同志，其所以发生错误的原因，是因为，第一：把党员成份决定意识的这个严肃的事实忽视了，这样便把党内成份不纯的一面完全抹煞，对一些严重不可救药的蜕化分子，流氓破坏分子，以至个别人在的阶级异己分子和政治上的异己分子，也轻轻放过了，并相反的把一切问题都推到领导上来，这是既不符合事实也不能容许的。第二：因之便把党内必要的组织改造和纪律制裁也取消了。事实上有不少支部虽然地主富农分子不存在，但这并不能说完全没有进行纪律制裁特别是组织调整的必要。事实证明，不少支部即使一般的不需要纪律制裁，但大部分经过整党是必须进行适当组织调整的，在我们过去比较忽视支部工作的地方，似乎更加有这种必要。第三：过分强调教育的结果，也必然相对的忽视了思想斗争，使一般党员放松了自己的错误检查，使党的教育缺乏了生动的活泼的内容，因而也就降低了教育的效果。
    左的偏向是怎样发生的呢？有些同志，他们有一种经验主义的公式，只要一提到“整”这个字，他们便了解为一定是要“算党员的千朝万代的历史错误老帐”，因此，他们把那些已经失掉了现实意义的思想与行为都翻出来，而给以批评斗争。这种旧话重说，旧帐重提，除了增加党员的“犯了一点错误一辈子擦不掉”的不愉快的沉重历史包袱而外，没有任何好处。他们对整党不重视实际中的不断改造，否认初步整顿也是整党的一部，他们的了解是一定要象过去干部整风一样，来一个集中地、彻头彻尾的反省，开展一个“大大地思想运动”，把党一下子整好。他们对那些历史上已经不断在进行过某些整党的支部（如白羊峪），在观念上不承认，而要硬去把他们的错误，再来个集中的清算。他们对党员的错误不重视在实际运动中不断给以克服，而是要等待系统整党。如汤阴的区干部到了三家村，党员要求帮助他们克服错误时，区干部说：现在是结束土改不是整党，等整党时再说吧！党员背上了包袱，工作不安心，他又说：现在不积极工作，将来整党时自找苦吃。他把整党看成了对党员的吓唬，他想离开实际工作中的不断改造而寄托希望于“集中的整”，其结果自然只有损伤党的朝气，使党员变成没有生气的畏首畏尾的，不敢负责的，没有积极性创造性的一群“老好人”。
    这一切左的右的偏向都是不能把党整好的，这都是由于不了解必须抓住支部党员中的现实问题，抓住支部党员中现存的好坏思想行为开展批评与自我批评，发扬积极因素，克服消极因素，才能把党整好这个正确的做法，所以结果都是同样糟糕的。目前虽然右的偏向较之左的偏向是更多的存在着，但应该警惕有些同志的左倾情绪是埋伏在系统整党时才会暴露出来的。因此，今天必须在思想上把左的右的偏向存在与发展明确起来，只有不断的对各种不同程度，不同地区，不同问题上展开两条战线的斗争，才能保证整党的胜利完成。
