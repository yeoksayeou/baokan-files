Xinhua News Agency, East China, 20th: The staff and workers of the factories affiliated with the East China Military Industry Bureau have made significant achievements in improving production methods and tools, and increasing production efficiency over the past year. In the past year, a total of 92 such improvements and creations have been achieved. Among them, the highest increase in production efficiency reached fourfold. The total value of various savings amounted to tens of millions of yuan (North Sea currency, same below). In terms of improving technology, the factories have trained a total of 31 apprentice workers in the second half of the year. Some of them have reached the technical level of general skilled workers. There are two characteristics of improving production and improving technology in the past year: First, starting from reality and based on existing tools, raw materials, and technical conditions, seeking improvement and upgrading, therefore, once successful, the results are significant. Some have increased quantity or quality; some have saved tools, raw materials, and manpower; some have overcome various difficulties, prevented dangers, and reduced worker suffering. Guo Sishu, a worker in a certain factory, improved a certain part, replacing wrought iron with cast iron, which not only saved expenses but also overcame the difficulty of raw materials and ensured the continued production. Another feature is that the improvement of technology has begun to become a mass movement and has broken the notion that "apprentice workers cannot create improvements." Qi Hongzhu and Liu Jiaying, apprentice workers in a certain factory, improved the method of softening copper, improving the quality of finished products and saving a total of more than 1.35 million yuan per month in labor, tools, raw materials, fuel, etc.

According to the experience of various factories, the main reasons for the improvement of technology are: (1) Creating a mass-based teaching technology movement. The master-apprentice relationship (some in the form of mutual aid groups) is one of the most important methods. Skilled workers automatically find their own apprentices (or organize mutual aid groups) and compete with each other, "See who teaches faster!" "See who learns faster!" The more teaching technology is strengthened, the closer the unity of the workers, and the more the apprentices respect the skilled workers. In this movement, some apprentices made rapid progress, such as Tan Xiangguo in a certain department, who had only been in the factory for three months and could work as well as a skilled worker, and is now teaching the technology he has learned to the new apprentices. (2) Universally conducting technical and cultural studies to improve workers' technical theory. (3) Implementing a reasonable reward system is very important for giving play to the enthusiasm of staff and workers in research and creation. Generally, those who have contributed to improving production are commended or given appropriate material rewards. For example, the East China Second Military Industry Bureau allocated 740,000 yuan in bonuses and awarded them separately according to the size of their contribution to production.

　　华东军工局各厂去年获重大成绩
  　创造和改进工具九十二种
    【新华社华东二十日电】华东军工局所属各厂职工，在改进生产方法与工具，提高生产效率上，一年来已获得重大成绩。一年来这种改进创造共达九十二种之多。其中在提高生产效率方面，最高者达四倍。各种节约所值共达数千万元（北海币，下同）。提高技术方面，下半年各厂共培养了三十一名学工（学习工人）。其中有一部分已达一般熟练工人的技术程度。一年来改进生产和提高技术有两个特点：首先是从实际出发，根据现有的工具、原料及技术条件，来求得改进和提高，因此，一旦成功，收效显著。有的提高了数量或品质；有的节省了工具、原料和人力；有的克服了各种困难，防止了危险，减少了工人疾苦。某厂工人郭思恕，改进了某种零件，以生铁代替了熟铁，不仅节省了开支，而且克服了原料的困难，保证了生产的继续进行。另一个特点是改进技术已开始成为群众性的运动，并打破了“学工不能创造改进”的观念。某厂学工祁洪珠、刘加英改进了软化紫铜的办法，提高成品质量，每月节约人工、工具、原料、燃料等总值一百三十五万余元。
    根据各厂经验，技术提高的主要原因有：（一）造成群众性的教学技术运动。师傅带徒弟（有的是互助组的形式），是其中重要的方式之一。技术工人自动找自己的徒弟（或组织互助小组），并互相竞赛，“看谁教得快！”“看谁学得快！”教学技术越加强，工人们的团结越密切，学工越尊重技术工人。在这运动中，有的徒弟进步很快，如某部谭先国，入厂刚三个月，干活能赶上一个熟练工人，现在又把自己学的技术教给新入厂的学工。（二）普遍进行技术文化学习，提高工人的技术理论。（三）实行合理的奖励制度，对发挥职工研究创造的积极性很重要。凡对于改进生产有贡献者，一般都予以表扬，或给予适当的物质奖励。加华东第二军工局即曾拨奖金七十四万元，按照对生产贡献之大小，分别进行了嘉奖。
