　　Teachers' Salary Income Should Not Be Confiscated
    To the Editor:
    Zhang Chuanyou of Xihuang Village, Eleventh District, Xingtai County, was classified as a middle peasant by the village. In June 1946, he became a teacher at the Seventh Senior Primary School in Xingtai. In November 1946, his family was subjected to struggle sessions. During the struggle, Zhang Chuanyou did not return home but continued to teach at the senior primary school, and his family relied on his salary to survive. In September 1947, he was labeled a landlord and forced to return home, and 600 jin of rice, books, stationery, and bedding were confiscated at the senior primary school. In May 1948, the village considered him an object of struggle, and because he was a landlord who had been forced to return, they took the books, stationery, bedding, and 600 jin of millet from the Seventh Senior Primary School to the village, lent the millet to the masses for consumption, and stored the stationery, books, and bedding at the Farmers' Association. After rectification, Zhang Chuanyou became a teacher at the Eighth Senior Primary School in the county. At the end of the land reform, the bedding, stationery, and books were returned to him, but the 600 jin of millet was not returned. Given this situation, can the 600 jin of millet be returned to him (to alleviate his current financial difficulties)? Please answer.

    Answer:
    A teacher's salary income is the result of their individual mental labor. Regardless of their family background, their income from teaching should not be confiscated during land reform. If it has already been confiscated, it should be returned or compensated. The village was correct in returning Zhang Chuanyou's confiscated stationery and bedding. As for the 600 jin of millet, since it has already been lent to the masses for consumption, the method of compensation should be determined based on the specific circumstances and resolved together when resettling or compensating his family.

　　教员薪金收入不应没收编辑同志：
    邢台县十一区西黄村张传尤，据村中划阶级是中农，一九四六年六月到邢台第七高小当教员，到一九四六年十一月家中被斗了，在斗争时，张传尤没有回到家里，继续在高小当教员，家中生活没有办法，依靠薪金米维持。一九四七年九月挤封建挤回到家，节省米六百斤及书籍文具铺盖均被扣留在高小。一九四八年五月间，村中认为是斗争对象，又是挤回的封建，就到七高小把书籍文具铺盖及六百斤小米拿到本村，将米借给群众吃了，文具书籍铺盖保存到农会，经纠偏后，张传尤又到本县第八高小当教员，在结束土改时把铺盖文具书籍退还本人，节省那六百斤米没有退回。根据这情况，这六百斤米是否能退还本人（解决点目前生活困难）？请解答。沙河支行尚士豪
    答：教员薪资收入，是其个人脑力劳动所得，无论其家庭成份为何，本人教书收入，在土地改革中都不应没收，过去已经没收了的，应予退还或补偿。张传尤被没收的文具铺盖，村中已经退还这是对的，六百斤小米因已借给群众吃用，如何补偿应根据具体情况，在对安置或补偿其家庭时一并解决。
