　　Smooth Progress in the Takeover of Beiping
　　Now Over 260 Units Received
　　Military Control Commission Allocates Large Amounts of Grain and Funds to Solve Living Problems of Employees
　　[Xinhua News Agency, Beiping, 19th] The takeover work in Beiping is progressing smoothly. As of the 12th, the Beiping Military Control Commission has taken over more than 260 units, including the original Kuomintang military and political organs, factories, and schools. The main ones include the Beiping Municipal Government, Hebei Provincial Government, Rehe Provincial Government, Hebei Provincial Security Command, Mentougou Coal Mine Company of the Resources Committee, Beiping Branch of Jibei Electric Power Company and its Shijingshan Power Plant, North China Iron and Steel Company and its Shijingshan Iron and Steel Plant, the 70th Arsenal of the Ordnance Department of the United Logistics Headquarters, Xishan Coal Mine Company, Beiping First Machine Factory, North China Cement Company, Yanjing Paper Mill, Beiping Woolen Mill, Central Geological Survey Institute, Mining and Metallurgical Research Institute, the Fifth Supply Zone Command of the Joint Logistics Headquarters and its four motor vehicle regiments and twenty health units, seven communications units, Pinghan Railway Bureau, North Section Management Office of the Pinghan Railway Bureau, Beiping Office of the Jinji Railway Bureau, Eighth District Highway Bureau, Hebei Provincial Highway Bureau, Beiping Postal Administration Bureau, Beiping Postal Savings and Remittance Bureau, Seventh District Telecommunications Bureau, Beiping Telecommunications Bureau, Jinji District National Taxation Administration Bureau, Beiping Branch of the Central Printing Factory, Beiping Branch of the Central Bank, Pingjin District Enemy and Puppet Property Administration Bureau, Beiping Central Broadcasting Station, Beiping Branch of the Central News Agency, North China Daily, Zhengzhong Bookstore, Third Factory of the Central Film Studio, Beiping Library, Tsinghua University, etc. Because the Military Control Commission resolutely implemented the correct policies of taking over according to the original organizational system, not disrupting the original enterprise structure, and strengthening the organization and discipline in the takeover work, the entire takeover work proceeded smoothly. All original Kuomintang government agencies in Beiping, with the exception of a very small number of the most heinous ringleaders who escaped by plane during the peaceful settlement negotiations, the vast majority of employees, including some responsible personnel, are waiting quietly to be taken over. The military representatives sent by the Military Control Commission ordered them to be responsible at each level and to transfer completely, thus avoiding possible confusion. Many former personnel have reported hidden materials. One agency alone found 42,000 sets of military uniforms, 20,000 cotton-padded coats, and 570 tons of raw hides hidden by the Kuomintang army based on reports. In order to maintain the integrity of the original enterprise system, the Beiping Military Control Commission stipulates that if the company to be taken over only has a branch in Beiping, and its head office is located in another city, the Military Control Commission will take over the Beiping branch, and then transfer it to its already taken over head office. If the head office is in Beiping and it has branches in other cities, personnel will be sent to contact the branches in other cities in order to gradually restore its original system. In order to solve the living problems of the broad masses of workers, students and staff in the agencies, factories and schools that have been taken over, the Military Control Commission has successively allocated large amounts of living expenses. As of the 12th, a total of 165,572,925 yuan in People's Currency and 7,495,663 catties of grain (wheat, millet, corn) have been loaned out.
