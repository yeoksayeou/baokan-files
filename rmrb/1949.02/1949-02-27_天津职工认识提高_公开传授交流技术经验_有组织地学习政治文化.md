　　Tianjin Workers Improve Understanding
    Publicly Impart and Exchange Technical Experience
    Organize Political and Cultural Learning
    [Tianjin Electric] Tianjin's public enterprise workers, now liberated, recognize that they are the masters of the factories and that improving productivity is for the long-term interests of the working class. They have begun to publicly impart and exchange production techniques and experiences that they were unwilling to share in the past. Wu Zhimin, a worker in the repair shop of the Third Power Plant of the Jibei Electric Power Company, recently wrote an article on the milling method of gear blanks based on his many years of valuable experience, including various tool numbers and the algorithm for dividing the machine head, and published it on the factory's employee bulletin board. This is an experience that some older workers do not know, and in the past, these experiences were generally not easily told to others; even when teaching apprentices, some would be kept secret. Employees of the company also automatically formed a technical research group, and the first group meeting recently included engineers, clerks, foremen, and apprentices. The topic of discussion was: how to start or stop a large steam engine. First, an engineer gave a detailed explanation of the interrelationship between oil, gas, water, sound, vibration, vacuum, revolutions, etc., and the technical sequence of various regulating valves. Then, everyone raised questions for research. Foreman Zhang, who operated the steam engine, shared many practical experiences in starting and stopping the steam engine, which combined the engineer's theoretical knowledge with the worker's practical experience, benefiting each other greatly. Finally, Foreman Zhang also said, "We have never had meetings like this to discuss technology to improve production efficiency in the past. It is really useful, and there are many principles that I now understand."
    Xinhua News Agency Tianjin, February 24th The workers in Tianjin are enthusiastically studying to improve their cultural and political levels. The Tianjin East Station Engineering Section of the Pingjin Railway, in order to carry out learning in a planned manner, has opened short-term worker training classes, drawing some workers to study full-time. Now the first group of 31 workers has completed their studies. The Tianjin Public Transport Management Office and the Tram Management Office have also jointly organized short-term training classes, drawing internal and external staff to study in rotation. The basic policies of the Communist Party of China and the People's Government, as well as the current revolutionary situation, are the main content of the workers' studies. In addition, some factory workers are also paying attention to learning technology and culture at the same time. The workers of the First Power Plant of Jibei Electric Power Company organized a technical study group, stipulating a certain amount of time each week to study various machines in the factory. The Second Factory of the Central Machine Factory stipulates that three days a week, experienced veteran workers teach new workers technology, and invite staff to explain the principles of the machines. Female workers at the Third Chemical Factory of Tianjin Enterprise Company and the workers at the Tianjin Electrical Repair Institute are learning to read. In addition, workers from factories such as the Tianjin Waterworks, Tianjin Telecommunications Bureau, and the Second Power Plant of Jibei Electric Power Company are also working hard to learn. They also published study bulletins, reporting on the learning situation and exchanging learning experiences. Some employees write articles for the Tianjin Daily and the Tianjin Branch of the Xinhua News Agency from time to time during their studies, reporting on production and learning trends. The Tianjin Daily published the news written by Wang Weihan, a worker at the Tianjin Enterprise Company Machine Factory, reporting on the workers' efforts to produce and improve production efficiency, in a prominent position, which greatly improved the Tianjin workers' learning enthusiasm and confidence in writing for the newspaper of the working class party.

　　天津职工认识提高
    公开传授交流技术经验
    有组织地学习政治文化
    【天津电】解放了的天津公营企业职工，认识自己已是工厂的主人翁，提高生产率是为工人阶级的长远利益，开始公开传授与交流过去不肯告人的生产技术和生产经验。冀北电力公司第三发电厂修理厂工人吴治民，日前根据自己多年的宝贵经验，写成一篇牙轮的铣法，其中包括各种刀号以及机头分齿的算法等，发表在厂里的职工壁报上。这是有些多年的老工人都不知道的经验，过去象这些经验，一般的决不轻易告人，就是教学徒也要留下一点。该公司职工还自动成立了一个技术研究小组，在最近举行的首次小组会上参加者包括工程师、职员、领班和学徒。讨论的题目是：怎样去开动或停止一架庞大的汽机。首先由一位工程师详细解说，关于油、汽、水、音、震动、真空度、回转数等等互相间的关系及启＠各种调节门技术上的种种顺序，然后大家提出问题研究。对于运用汽机的张领班，说出许多开停汽机的实际经验，使工程师的理论知识与工人的实际经验相结合，彼此得益甚大。最后张领班也说：“大家在一块这样开会讨论技术，以提高生产效力在过去从没有搞过。真有用处，有好多原理，我现在才明白。”
    【新华社天津二十四日电】天津的职工们正在热烈的进行学习，以提高自己的文化、政治水平。平津铁路天津东站工务段，为了有计划地进行学习，曾经开办短期的工人练习班，抽调部分工人全日学习，现在第一期卅一个工人已经学习完毕。天津公共汽车管理处和电车管理处，也共同组织了短期学习班，抽调内外勤职工轮流学习。中国共产党和人民政府各项基本政策，以及目前的革命形势，是职工们学习的主要内容。另外有些工厂的职工还同时注意学习技术和文化。冀北电力公司第一发电厂的工人组织了技术学习小组，每周规定一定的时间研究厂内各种机器。中央机器厂第二厂规定每周三天由技术熟练的老工人教授新工人以技术，并邀请职员讲解机器原理。天津企业公司第三化学厂的女工和天津电气修理所的工人们，正在学习识字。此外，如天津自来水厂、天津电信局、冀北电力公司第二发电厂等各工厂的职工，也努力学习。他们并且分别出版了学习壁报，报道学习情形和交流学习经验。有些职工在学习中不时为天津日报和新华社天津分社写稿，报道生产情况，学习动态。天津企业公司机器厂工人王维翰所写报道该厂工人努力生产、提高生产效率的消息，天津日报曾以首要地位发表，大大提高了天津职工的学习情绪和为工人阶级政党的报纸写稿的信心。
