On the Front Lines of Beiping
    Xin Tuo, Sun Yuzhang

　　I. “Eternal Security of the Rivers and Mountains”
    Along the newly repaired Pinghan Railway (Zhuozhou to Fengtai section), long trains, batches of large trucks, and carts pulled by four animals are transporting grass, firewood, and military supplies. Like a tide, they surge northeastward. The trucks are running at full power, and the soldiers driving the carts cheerfully crack their long whips, the four horses galloping across the newly repaired Lugou Bridge. The Kuomintang had whitewashed the four characters “永固山河” (Eternal Security of the Rivers and Mountains) on the gate of Lugou Bridge. Now, beneath those characters, stands a heroic sentry of the People's Liberation Army. For the declining class, this is a great irony, because what is eternally secure is not the “rivers and mountains” of Chiang Kai-shek's Kuomintang, but the world of the people.
    On a dilapidated asphalt road, the People's Liberation Army is practicing combat maneuvers on both sides of the road. The sound of artillery fire during simulated city attacks constantly reaches people's ears. Part of the People's Liberation Army, mixed with many villagers, is sawing wood, busily making siege equipment for attacking Beiping, or nailing horseshoes onto the livestock. Occasionally, bursts of joyful laughter can be heard.
    Here, it is only seven or eight *li* from Beiping.
　　II. A Road to Beiping
    Leaving the asphalt road and turning right onto a dirt road for two or three *li*, one sees a road leading to Beiping—a communication trench is being built. This road is about ten *li* long, and most of it has been completed in three days. This road is not easy to build, as the weather is cold and the ground is frozen. It is difficult to work. Further ahead, it is too close to the enemy, so it cannot be dug during the day, only at night under the moonlight. Hands are cracking, but they are wrapped in gauze and continue to dig. In some places, water is dug out after digging three *chi*, and even with corn stalks laid on top, they keep digging. Those participating in the digging, whether soldiers or civilians, overcome all difficulties. “Let us sweat more so that the soldiers shed less blood!” During the day, the reporter walks along the raised earth of the trench, and the wet soil has frozen into ice. One can see them swinging their pickaxes and shovels again and again. At night, back at the front, one still sees them digging silently. It is too close to the enemy, so even speaking loudly is not allowed. The reporter squats down and asks the resting civilian platoon leader: “Are you afraid?” This platoon leader is called Li Yujiang. He says very displeased: "Afraid!? I participated in the Pinghan Campaign and the PingSui Campaign. This is the last time, what is there to be afraid of? I will not go home until Beiping is taken. I still want to get a few American guns to use!" The civilian company commander says beside him: "Digging this is also for ourselves. Otherwise, when carrying stretchers, without this trench, walking on flat ground, isn't it easy to be hit by the enemy?" These civilians are all people from the old liberated areas who have experienced many battles. They are helping the troops during combat gaps to dig. With their cooperation, this road is rapidly advancing into the heart of the Kuomintang in Beiping.
　　III. In the Second Line
    In the anti-tank artillery position, we sit on the tarpaulin covers of the cannons. Looking out through the gun ports of the fortifications, we can vaguely see the first line and, in the distance, the enemy's Beer Company building (the enemy's artillery position) five *li* away. Suddenly, about a hundred meters ahead, a middle-aged man with a basket is selling things. A People's Liberation Army soldier buys a persimmon, throws down the money, and leaves. We are curious and call him over. His name is Hu Zhenhai, he is thirty-three years old this year, and he is from nearby. He now sells more than 200,000 (border currency) a day, earning about 40,000 to 50,000 (border currency). A comrade asks him: “Aren't you afraid in this place!” He laughs and says: "They are all our own people, what is there to be afraid of?!" He immediately says: "I used to be afraid. On the fourteenth (i.e., the day the People's Liberation Army arrived), I hid in the air-raid shelter for a day and a night. They (referring to the Kuomintang army) said when they were about to run away: 'After the People's Liberation Army comes, the old and the young will be buried alive.' After the People's Liberation Army came, it turned out that it was not like that at all. Take the persimmons, for example! I sell them for 4,000 each, and they (referring to the People's Liberation Army) will not give me 3,500!" Finally, he says: "It will be good when Beiping is taken, I will go to sell vegetables when Beiping is taken."
    Following this line of communication trenches northward, we see a group of the largest fortifications—five of the largest bunkers. These were completed by the Eighth Company of a certain unit in six hours under the personal labor of the company commander and instructor. The enemy discovered them and fired a volley of grenades, the shells landing on top of the bunkers, only blasting a pit, which the soldiers then covered with soil. Next to this group of bunkers are several civilian houses. The People's Liberation Army has clearly painted various slogans on the walls, the most obvious of which is: “Strictly observe the Three Main Rules of Discipline and the Eight Points for Attention.” Not far away on an earthen bank, several children have already skillfully learned the songs sung by the People's Liberation Army. When they see us passing by, they burst out laughing.
　　IV. At the Front Lines
    The night is very quiet, and the crescent moon hangs overhead. Several of us go to the front lines.
    The machine guns are firing intermittently. As we approach the front lines, we lose our way and enter the courtyard of a villager. An old man comes out. He tells us the direction of ×××× and points to the right hand, saying: "Don't go that way, the enemy is constantly shooting there." He sends us for fifty or sixty meters, then points to a clump of willows fifty meters ahead, saying: "It's there!"
    In a house close to the front lines, a unit of the People's Liberation Army is eating dinner—piles of baked pancakes and large pots of stewed cabbage. The day before yesterday, Zhao Jinlin, the squad leader of the Third Squad of a certain company, and Cheng Qiyun and Pan Jinhui caught Kuomintang soldiers who had come to a village between the enemy and our lines to steal chickens. However, the squad leader heroically sacrificed himself in yesterday's engagement. Yan Chengyi, a twenty-two-year-old young platoon leader, speaks of his fallen comrade with hatred filling his face. This position was only captured the day before yesterday. The front lines the day before yesterday were the second line we visited during the day. Yan Chengyi says to us decisively: "Anyway, we will resolutely complete the tasks assigned by the superiors. If the enemy comes, we will fight, if they don't come, we will dig fortifications!" Finally, he adds: "We must fight the enemy back no matter what!" This sentence is a head-on blow to the Kuomintang army attempting to escape.
    Here, it is only sixty or seventy meters from the enemy and only about two *li* from the Zhangyi Gate of Beiping. During the day, the city wall can be clearly seen. The young platoon leader does not let us return by the original route. He sends us into a communication trench that leads directly to the rear.
　　V. Waiting for the General Offensive Order
    On the way back, soldiers and civilians are all working busily, digging fortifications, practicing, surveying, and transporting things. There are no words, only the sound of footsteps. In the distance, signal flares are constantly seen drawing bright lines in the sky. Occasionally, there is the sound of machine guns in engagement.
    The night temporarily quiets down. Everything seems to be waiting, waiting for Commander Lin's general offensive order.

　　在北平前线
    辛拓　孙玉章
　　一、“永固山河”
    在新修复的平汉路沿线（涿县到丰台段），长长的列车、成批的大卡车、四个牲口拉着的皮轮大车，载着草，载着烧柴，载着军需品。象潮水一样的往东北涌着。卡车开足了马力，赶车的战士快活的扬起长长的马鞭，四匹马飞也似的驰过了新修复的芦沟桥。永定河的水早已冻住了，西北风顺着河路吹过来。战士们把新从国民党仓库里取出来的皮帽，将两耳放下来抵御了寒冷。芦沟桥的城门上，国民党曾用白粉刷了“永固山河”四个大字，而今在“永固山河”四个大字的下面，却立着解放军英勇的哨兵，这对于没落阶级来说，是一个很大的讽刺，因为永固的不是蒋介石国民党的“山河”，而是人民的天下了。
    在一条已经残旧的柏油马路上，解放军正在大路两旁演习着战斗动作。演习攻城的炮声，不时传到人们的耳朵里。解放军一部正和许多老乡混在一起拉着大锯，正在忙碌的制造攻打北平的攻坚器材，或者在给牲口钉着蹄铁。有时，还偶尔发出一阵愉悦的笑声。
    这里，离北平仅只有七、八里地了。
  　二、一条大路通北平
    走下柏油路，顺着一条土路往右插去，走个三、二里地，就看见一条通往北平的大路——交通壕正在修筑着。这条大路长十里左右，三天的功夫已经完成了大部。这条大路不是容易修的，天冷地冻，不好下家伙。往前边，离敌人太近，白天挖不了，黑夜趁着月色挖。手震裂了，包上纱布照样挖。有的地方挖下三尺就挖出水来，上连垫着棒子秸还挖。参加挖壕的人们，不管是部队就是民工，战胜了一切困难。“咱们多流一滴汗，少叫战士流一滴血！”白天，记者巡行在挖出的土梗上，湿土已经冻成冰块，可以看到他们“啊次！啊次！”的一镐跟着一镐刨，一锹跟着一锹铲。夜里，又到前边，还看见他们在无声的刨着。离敌人太近，连话也不能大声讲，记者蹲下身去，向正在休息的民工排长问：“害怕不？”这个排长叫李玉江，他非常不高兴的说：“怕！？那次平汉战役、平绥战役我都参加了，这回是最后一次，怕什么？不打开北平不回家。我还想得几支美国枪使呢？”民工连长在旁边说：“挖这个也是为我们自己，要不然抬担架下来，没有这沟，走平地，不是容易叫敌人打吗？”这些民工都是身经百战的老解放区的人民，这是利用战斗空隙帮助部队来挖的。在他们配合之下，这条大路正迅速的向北平国民党心窝里插去。
  　三、在第二线
    在战防炮阵地里，我们坐在水龙布的炮衣上，顺着工事的炮孔往外望去，可以隐隐约约的看见第一线，可以远远的看到五里以外敌人的啤酒公司大楼（敌人的炮兵阵地）。忽然间，在前边百来米达处有一个挎篮子的中年人在卖东西。一个解放军战士买了一个柿子扔下钱就走了。我们好奇的把他叫过来，他叫胡振海，今年三十三岁，就是附近人。现在一天卖二十多万元。能赚个四、五万元（均边币）。一个同志问他：“在这个地方你也不害怕！”他笑了说：“都是咱们自己人怕什么？！”他随即说：“以前是害怕，十四那天（即解放军来到那天），我躲在防空壕里一天一夜。他们（指国民党军）临跑时说：‘解放军来了之后，老小都要活埋。’等解放军来了之后，原来满不是那么回事，就拿柿子来说吧！我卖四千一个，人家（指解放军）也不给三千五啊！”最后他说：“打开北平就好了，打开北平去卖菜。”
    随着这道火线的交通壕往北走去，一群最大的工事——五个最大的地堡，这是某部八连在连长指导员亲自动手劳动下，六个小时完成的，敌人发现了曾用榴弹炮排射了一阵，炮弹落在地堡顶上，只炸了一个坑，过后战士又用土埋上了。这群地堡旁边，就是几所老百姓的房子。在墙上，解放军清楚的刷着各种标语，其中最明显的一条是：“严格遵守三大纪律八项注意。”不远的一个土坎子上，几个小孩子已经很熟练的学会了解放军唱的歌子，看见我们过去，哄的一下笑起来。
  　四、在前沿
    夜静得很，上弦月悬在当头，我们几个人到前沿去。
    机枪有时断续的响着，快到前沿的时候，我们迷失了方向，走进一家老乡的院子，一个老头走出来，他告诉我们××××的方向，并指着右手说：“可别由那边去，那边敌人净打枪。”他送了我们有五、六十米达，就指着前边五十米达处的一丛柳树说：“就是那里！”
    在一所紧靠前沿的房子里，解放军某部正在吃夜饭，成堆的烙饼，大锅的熬白菜。前天，某连三班长赵锦林和程起云、潘锦惠三个人还捉住到敌我火线中间村庄来抢老百姓鸡的国民党军，可是三班长在昨天的接触中，英勇的牺牲了。二十二岁的年轻排长颜成义同志提到他牺牲的战友时，脸上充满了仇恨。这块阵地是前天才夺过来的，前天的前沿，就是我们白天到过的第二线。颜成义斩钉断铁的和我们说：“反正是这样，坚决完成上级所给的任务。敌人来了就打，不来就挖工事！”最后，他补充一句：“无论如何要把敌人拼回去！”这句话对于企图逃跑的国民党军是当头一棒。
    这里离敌人仅六七十米达，离北平彰义门仅二里地左右。白天，可以清楚的看到城墙。年轻的排长不叫我们由原路回去了，他送我们到直通后方的一个交通壕里。
  　五、等待着总攻命令
    回来的路上，部队和民工都在忙碌的工作着，挖工事、演习、测量、运东西。没有话，只有脚步声。远处不断看见信号弹在天空划一道亮光，偶有接触的机枪，有时还叫着。
    夜暂时的静下来，一切都好象在等待着，等待着林司令员的总攻命令。
     一九四九、一、十，于北平前线
