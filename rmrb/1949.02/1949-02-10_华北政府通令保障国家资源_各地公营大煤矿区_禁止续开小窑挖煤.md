　　North China Government Issues Circular to Protect National Resources
  　Publicly-Owned Major Coal Mining Areas
    Continued Opening of Small Coal Pits Prohibited

    [Report from this newspaper] In order to prohibit the continued opening of small coal pits in major mining areas, the North China People's Government issued a circular to the public enterprise departments of all administrative offices and directly-controlled municipal governments, and all affiliated coal companies last month, stating:

    It is reported that recently the number of private individuals opening small pits within various publicly-owned coal mining areas has been increasing daily. This kind of unorganized and unplanned arbitrary mining is extremely destructive to the mining areas. County and district governments often do not understand the seriousness of the damage caused by small pits to the mining areas, and are mostly indifferent to this, and even reward mining operations. In order to protect national resources and facilitate future economic construction, it is specifically decided that all major mining areas (Jingxing, Yangquan, Fengfeng, Jiaozuo, Baijin, and other coal mining areas) are strictly prohibited from continuing to open small coal pits. The small coal pits that have been opened in the past should also be managed by the local government in conjunction with the local publicly-owned coal mining company. It is hoped that this will be relayed and implemented, and that a report on the implementation will be submitted to this government.

　　华北政府通令保障国家资源
  　各地公营大煤矿区
    禁止续开小窑挖煤
    【本报讯】为禁止在各大矿区续开小窑挖煤，华北人民政府于上月通令各行署直辖市府公营企业部及所属各煤业公司称：
    据报近来各公营煤矿区内私人开小窑者日有增加，此种无组织无计划之任意开采，对矿区破坏性极大。县区政府往往因不了解小窑破坏矿区之严重性，对此多漠不关心，甚且有奖励开采者，兹为保障国家资源，以利今后经济建设计特决定所有现在各大矿区（井陉、阳泉、峰峰、焦作、白晋等各煤矿区）一律禁止续开小窑挖煤，过去所开小窑，亦应由当地政府会同该地公营煤矿公司加以管理，希即转饬遵行，并将执行情形报告本府。
