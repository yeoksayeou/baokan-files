Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 24th: TASS reports: In the Soviet Union, many sanatoriums and rest homes continue to operate during the winter. Not long ago, tens of thousands of workers, staff, collective farmers, and their children spent their vacations or received treatment in newly built rest homes in the Caucasus, Crimea, and elsewhere. Crimean sanatoriums are making every effort to accommodate patients. In the famous "Artek" children's camp, there are now six hundred male and female primary school students from all over the country. The children continue their studies in the children's camp.

　　In 1948, trade unions spent more than 1.3 billion rubles on sanatoriums and rest homes, and a total of 2 million people stayed in sanatoriums and rest homes, which is close to the pre-war number. This year's accommodation volume will increase by 300,000 people compared to last year. Many sanatoriums and rest homes were damaged during the German occupation. In the first three years of the post-war Five-Year Plan, trade unions spent a total of 1 billion rubles to repair them and build 80 new ones. There are now 770 sanatoriums and rest homes belonging to trade unions, most of which are rest homes. These sanatoriums and rest homes are located in Crimea, the Caucasus, Ukraine, the Urals, the Black Sea coast, the Baltic republics, and places near Moscow and Leningrad with beautiful scenery and suitable climates. Workers, technicians, engineers, staff, and school teachers who suffer from chronic diseases or have just been discharged from the hospital can enter sanatoriums for free medical treatment to restore their health.

　　苏联的疗养院和休养所
    许多在冬季也继续开放
    【新华社陕北二十四日电】塔斯社讯：苏联有许多疗养院和休养所在冬季也继续开放。不久以前，有几万个工人、职员、集体农民和他们的孩子们，在高加索、克里米亚和其他地方新建造的休养所里消度他们的假期或进行治疗。克里米亚的疗养院，正在尽量收容病人。在闻名的“亚特克”儿童营里，现在有六百个来自全国各地的男女小学生。孩子们在儿童营里继续他们的学业。
    一九四八年一年中，职工会用于疗养和休养的经费达十三亿卢布以上，共有两百万人住过疗养院和休养所，这已接近于战前的数目。今年的收容数量，将比去年增加三十万人。在德寇侵占期间，许多疗养院和休养所曾被破坏。在战后五年计划的头三年当中，职工会共化去十亿卢布加以修复，并新建造了八十座。现在属于职工会的疗养院和休养所，共有七百七十座，其中大部分是休养所。这些疗养院和休养所都设在克里米亚、高加索、乌克兰、乌拉尔、黑海海岸、波罗的海各共和国、莫斯科、列宁格勒附近风景秀丽气候适宜的地方。各业工人、技师、工程师、职员和学校教员、如果生慢性病或病愈刚出医院，都可以进疗养所得到免费医疗，以恢复健康。
