　　Jinzhong Formulates Construction Steps
  　Decides to Start with Key Points First
    [This Newspaper] In order to implement the Central Committee’s resolution on building the League, the Jinzhong District Committee of the Chinese Communist Party made a decision. The decision first pointed out that in order to correctly implement the Central Committee’s policy on building the League, Party committees at all levels must conscientiously discuss the Central Committee’s resolution on building the League, make specific plans for building the League, and convene youth work representative conferences at the prefectural committee level to disseminate and deploy the plans. When building the League, it is imperative to pay attention to preventing simple practices of forced recruitment on the one hand, and to prevent narrow-minded closed-doorism on the other. The decision then pointed out that equipping and training cadres is of decisive significance in the work of building the League. It requires Party committees at all levels to equip the counties and districts above the key counties for building the League with cadres in the near future. General counties must also be equipped with more than three district youth work cadres, and the Youth League committees of the prefectural committees must be fully staffed according to the authorized number of personnel. At the same time, in order to cultivate and promote young cadres in a planned way, the local Party committees and Party schools must cultivate more than 10% of district-level youth cadres in the total number of cadres to be cultivated on a regular basis. Each county must also prepare to mobilize five outstanding young male and female district and village-level Party member cadres or conscious outstanding educated youths to study at administrative cadre schools to cultivate district and county-level youth work cadres. The work of building the League should have key points and steps. According to the situation in our region, we should first focus on organizing forces in cities, factories, schools, and government organs. In rural areas, we should focus on carrying out the work in large villages and towns with concentrated populations and a large number of young people. At the same time, in order to combine the building of the League with the current central work (land reform and Party rectification), we must focus on (in key counties, we should determine key villages) carrying out the work of building the League simultaneously with the work of building the Party in the land reform movement in the new areas. In the key villages in the old areas that have completed land reform and are carrying out Party rectification, three to five outstanding young male and female Party members must be selected and given short-term training to serve as the backbone and foundation for building the League in the village. The decision finally pointed out that in addition to the key counties or factories and schools that are required to achieve certain results before April, all localities must also carry out the work of building the League in more than ten key villages in other general counties. On the one hand, we can gain experience to facilitate comprehensive promotion, and on the other hand, we can adapt to the needs of the situation. Before April, each local Party committee must convene a meeting of League member representatives in at least three counties to formally establish the County League Committee, and at the same time establish the League Committees of each special zone and administrative office, and select representatives to attend the North China and National League Congress before the "May Fourth" Movement. Strengthening the leadership of Party committees at all levels is an important key to carrying out the work of building the League. Young women account for a considerable number of all young people. When building the League, we must pay attention to absorbing advanced and active young women into the League, and we must pay attention to cultivating a considerable number of young women League member cadres, which is the key to strengthening the work of young women.

　　晋中制定建国步骤
  　决定先从重点做起
    【本报讯】中共晋中区党委为执行中央建团决议，作出决定。决定中首先指出：为正确的执行中央的建团方针，各级党委必须认真的讨论中央建团的决议，作出具体的建团计划，以地委为单位召开青年工作代表会议，进行传达布置；在建团时，必须确实注意，一方要防止强迫拉夫的简单做法，同时也须防止狭隘的关门主义倾向。决定继即指出：配备与训练干部在建团工作中是有决定意义的。要求各级党委，在最近时期内要把建团的重点县之县、区以上的干部配齐，一般县还须配备三个以上的区青年工作干部，地委青委必须按编制人数全部配齐，同时为了有计划的培养与提拔青年干部，各地委、党校，须在培养干部的总额里，按期培养百分之十以上的区级青年干部，各县并须准备动员五名优秀青年男女区村级党员干部或有觉悟的优秀知识青年，送行政干部学校学习，以培养区、县级的青年工作干部。建团工作要有重点有步骤，根据我区情况，首先在城市、工厂、学校、机关有重点地组织力量去进行；在农村应着重在人口集中，青年较多的大村镇去进行。同时为了建团和目前的中心工作（土改与整党）相结合，在新区土改运动中须有重点的（在重点县应确定重点村）把建团工作与建党工作同时进行；在老区结束土改与进行整党的重点村，须即抽出三至五个优秀男女青年党员，加以短期训练，以作为该村建团的骨干与基础。决定最后指出：各地除重点县或工厂、学校要求在四月以前要做出一定的成绩外，还必须在其他一般县的十个以上的重点村进行建团工作。一方面可取得经验，便于全面的推广，一方面适应形势的需要。在四月以前各地委最少须有三个以上的县份，要召开团员代表会议，正式成立团县委会，同时并成立各专区与行署的团委员会，以及在“五四”前选出代表出席华北与全国的团代表大会。各级党委的加强领导，则是建团工作开展的重要关键。青年妇女在全部青年中，占着相当的数量，建团时一定要注意吸收先进的积极的青年妇女入团，并须注意培养相当数量的青年妇女团员干部，这是加强青年妇女工作的关键。
