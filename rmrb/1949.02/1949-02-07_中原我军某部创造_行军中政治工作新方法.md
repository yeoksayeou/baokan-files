Xinhua News Agency, Central Plains, 5th. A certain unit of the People's Liberation Army in the Central Plains, during this new advance, created many new methods and experiences of political work during marches, focusing on consolidating the central work of the troops, ensuring the completion of the marching task. The unit's marching work methods and experiences are introduced as follows: First, in order to further consolidate the troops during the march, the marching task, the enemy situation, and the significance of the action should first be explained to the soldiers, so that the leadership's intentions are understood and grasped by the masses. Secondly, it is important to go deep into the companies, promptly understand the situation, provide timely explanations and education, and constantly ensure the troops' vigorous morale. At the same time, careful marching organization, strict management, and education on unity and mutual assistance for soldiers are also very important. Many troops also pay attention to hygiene work during marches, and the prevention and treatment methods for diseases such as frostbite and blisters are reported and introduced in each brigade. Second, the units carried out realistic education during the march. For example, when the machine gun and artillery company of a certain regiment marched through the border area, they encountered migrant workers who voluntarily came out from the liberated areas to support the front line and poor people begging for food from the Kuomintang-controlled areas. Based on this situation, the company headquarters organized the soldiers to discuss it. Veteran soldiers talked about how the liberated areas had implemented land reform, developed production, and everyone had food and clothing, so there were no more beggars, so they were all voluntarily supporting the front line. Newly liberated soldiers also talked about the hunger and poverty of the people in the Kuomintang-controlled areas. This kind of discussion comparing the reality of the situation was of great educational significance to the soldiers. The Eighth Company of a certain regiment used "marching literacy signs." In four days, all the soldiers in the company recognized the phrases "marching for merit," "not falling behind," "iron legs," and "persisting to the end." In this way, not only can the soldiers learn to read, but they can also lead marching slogans. Third, all units universally carried out commendation and encouragement work during the march. For example, a certain unit used propaganda sheds, marching leaflets, clapper talks, and peep shows to carry out mass commendation and encouragement work. Another example is the First Battalion of a certain regiment, which created two mobile banners: "Hard Bones" and "Mass Discipline." The Third Company of the battalion enthusiastically carried out various work competitions in order to win the model banner. This flexible and diverse commendation method played a powerful role in encouraging the soldiers. Fourth, promptly summarize the experience of marching work. After arriving at the destination, a certain brigade immediately carried out "four march evaluations": evaluating learning progress, evaluating mutual assistance between comrades, evaluating mass discipline, and evaluating military management. After the evaluation, a summary was made.

　　中原我军某部创造
  　行军中政治工作新方法
    【新华社中原五日电】中原人民解放军某部在此次新的进军中，围绕巩固部队的中心工作，创造出许多新的行军中的政治工作的方法和经验，保证了行军任务的完成。兹将该部行军工作方法与经验介绍如下：第一，为使部队在行军中更加巩固，首先应将行军任务、敌情、行动意义向战士们讲明，使得领导企图为群众所了解与掌握；其次是深入连队、及时了解情况，及时解释教育，经常保证部队的旺盛情绪。同时，行军组织周密，严格管理及向战士进行团结互助教育，也是很重要的。许多部队并注意行军时的卫生工作，将所发生的冻疮、打泡等疾病，在各旅报上介绍预防和治疗办法。第二，各单位在行军中进行了现实的教育。如某团机炮连行军经过边沿地区时，碰上从解放区自动出来支援前线的民工及国民党统治区讨饭的穷人。该连连部即根据此种情形，组织战士进行讨论。老战士谈起因解放区实行了土地改革，发展生产，人人有饭吃、有衣穿，所以早已没有讨饭的了，因此他们都是自愿支援前线。新解放战士跟着也说起国民党统治区人民的饥饿穷困的情形。这种对比现实情况的讨论，对战士们的教育意义很大。某团八连使用了“行军识字牌”，四天中全连战士共认识了“行军立功”、“不掉队”、“铁腿”、“坚持到底”等字条。这样，不但能使战士识字，而且又能领导行军口号。第三，各单位普遍开展了行军中的表扬与鼓励工作。如某部利用鼓动棚、行军传单、快板、拉洋片等进行群众性的表扬鼓励工作。又如某团第一营制了两面流动旗——“硬骨头”与“群众纪律”。该营第三连为夺取模范旗，热烈开展各种工作竞赛。这种灵活、多样的表扬方法，对战士们起了有力的鼓舞作用。第四，及时总结行军工作经验。某旅到达目的地后，即进行了“行军四评”评学习进少，评战友之间的互助，评群众纪律，评军事管理。评好后即进行总结。
