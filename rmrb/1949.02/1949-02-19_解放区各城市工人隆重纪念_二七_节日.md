Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 17th. This year, in addition to the previously reported cities of Beiping, Tianjin, Shenyang, Kaifeng, and Yan'an, workers in Jinan, Xuzhou, Shijiazhuang, Zhangjiakou, Tangshan, and other major cities in the liberated areas also held grand commemorative gatherings on this day for the "February 7th" anniversary. In Zhengzhou, the city where the "February 7th" general strike movement was launched, the municipal government held a banquet, inviting veteran workers who participated in the "February 7th" general strike and workers who have made contributions to the resumption of production in various industries since the liberation of Zhengzhou. Workers in various industries in Zhengzhou also launched a fundraising campaign to express their condolences to the families of the martyrs who died in the "February 7th" incident. The first Workers' Representative Conference in the Central Plains Liberated Area officially opened on "February 7th." In Jinan City, over 30,000 workers held a commemorative gathering on this day. Zhang Liyan, a railway worker who participated in the "February 7th" strike, said at the meeting: "We workers have already embarked on the bright path that the 'February 7th' era demanded, but the Kuomintang reactionaries have not been completely eliminated. The People's Liberation Army is going to cross the Yangtze River to liberate all of China, and our railway workers must drive the train to Nanjing! To Guangzhou!" A parade was held after the meeting. The marching procession, led by a large red flag and a military band, stretched for more than ten li. Party, government, military, and academic circles in Jinan lined the streets to set off firecrackers and shout welcoming slogans. In Xuzhou City, workers in various factories had held discussion meetings since February 1st, and some factories even published special wall newspapers commemorating "February 7th." When commemorating "February 7th", the working class in various places enthusiastically celebrated their liberation, unanimously supported Chairman Mao's eight peace conditions, and expressed their determination to work harder in their positions to achieve these conditions. A year ago, except for Shijiazhuang, the above-mentioned cities were all under the rule of the Kuomintang reactionaries, and this year is the first time that the "February 7th" festival has been openly commemorated. When more than 30,000 workers in Jinan City stepped into the memorial meeting place under the guidance of dozens of red flags and giant portraits of Chairman Mao and Commander-in-Chief Zhu, the workers excitedly talked to each other: "I didn't expect the Jinan workers' contingent to be so large!"
