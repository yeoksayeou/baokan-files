Xinhua News Agency, Beiping, 10th. The People's Municipal Government of Beiping has established more than 230 recovery stations in the city to recover counterfeit Gold Yuan Certificates. On the 5th alone, it recovered 60 million Gold Yuan Certificates. The recovery method stipulates that 10 Gold Yuan Certificates can be exchanged for 1 RMB. Workers, students, and teachers can enjoy special treatment, that is, each person can exchange up to 500 Gold Yuan Certificates at a rate of 3 Gold Yuan Certificates for 1 RMB. This reasonable method has been supported by the majority of citizens, and those who request exchanges have been very crowded in recent days. Due to the People's Municipal Government's recovery of counterfeit Gold Yuan Certificates and other measures to stabilize the market, commodity prices in Beiping are now trending downward.

　　人民市府收兑伪金圆券
  　北平物价日趋下跌
  　北宁平张等线通车
    【新华社北平十日电】北平市人民市政府为收兑伪金圆券，在市内设立二百三十多个收兑所，仅五日一天，就收入了伪金圆券六千万元。收入办法规定伪金圆券十元兑换人民币一元，工人、学生和教职员等可享受特殊优待，即每人在伪金圆券五百元以内，可按伪金圆券三元兑换人民币一元之比率兑换。此项合理办法，受到广大市民拥护，连日要求兑换者十分拥挤。由于人民市政府收兑伪金圆券及其他稳定市场的措施，平市物价现已日趋下跌。
