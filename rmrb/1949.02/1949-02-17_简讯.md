To the offices of district party committees, prefectural party committees, county party committees, administrative offices of districts, administrative offices of prefectures, and county governments:

　　Annual production plans and spring plowing production plans for various regions have been successively formulated. We have now received materials from the Sixth Administrative Office of the Taihang Region, the Fifth Administrative Office of the North Yue Region, the Party Committee of the South Hebei Region and its Fifth Administrative Office, and Tunliu County in the Taiyue Region.

　　These materials are of great help to us in understanding the overall agricultural and industrial production situation. We hope that counties and units that have not yet sent these materials will send them as soon as possible. We plan to organize these materials and publish excerpts in the newspaper. This will be of great help in exchanging experiences and promoting this year's production campaign.
