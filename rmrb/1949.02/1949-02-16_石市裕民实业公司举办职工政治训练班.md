    Shishi Yumin Industrial Company Holds Employee Political Training Class

    In order to further enhance the class consciousness of its employees, Shijiazhuang Yumin Industrial Company held its first employee political training class. The class was divided into two phases, before and after, with classes held every other day. More than 240 students attended the class. The first phase focused on the history of the Chinese Communist Party's struggle and how to be a good Communist Party member. The second phase focused on teaching Party building knowledge. When lecturing, the course combined specific examples of sectarianism, status seeking, and liberalism among employees, and adopted a casual approach to explain the points. The spirit of mutual assistance in learning was also promoted. In both phases of the study, the machine factory achieved test scores above 90 points, and the understanding of employees was greatly improved. For example, Xia Hong, a newly joined employee, wrote in his answer sheet requesting the Party to review his qualifications and admit him to the Party. Many employees hoped that the Party would give more criticism and help them to improve and correct their shortcomings. Zhao Xiaoxi, a worker in the weaving factory, reflected on his understanding of criticism and self-criticism, saying, "In the past, I thought criticism was to strike people, and admitting mistakes was not good." After studying, he corrected these confused ideas, and the relationship between Party members and the masses became closer. However, when giving examples in class, the class failed to connect more with the good and bad facts of the employees in each factory for education, and some factories only emphasized the busy production and relaxed the leadership organization of learning. The class has now ended as scheduled, and the students who have returned to the factory have maintained the learning mood they had during the training.

　　石市裕民实业公司举办职工政治训练班
    石家庄市裕民实业公司为使职工阶级觉悟更加提高，首次兴办职工政治训练班，该班分前后两期，隔日上课一次。到课学员共二百四十余人，前期以中国共产党的斗争历史及怎样做一个好的共产党员为主要课程，后期则着重讲授党建知识。讲授课文时结合职工中存在的宗派、地位、自由主义等具体事例，采取漫谈方法进行讲解，并发扬学习中的互助精神，两期学习中，机器厂测验均在九十分以上，职工认识大大提高，如新参加工作的职员夏虹，答题中写着要求党审查他的条件吸收入党。许多职工均希望党多给予批评帮助进步，改正缺点。织布厂工友赵小喜对批评与自我批评认识反省道：“以前对批评认为是打击人，承认错误不好看”。经过学习以后，纠正了这些糊涂思想，党员与群众之间的关系，也更加亲密了。但该班在讲课举例时，未能更多的联系各厂职工中好坏事实进行教育，也有个别厂子只强调生产忙，放松了学习的领导组织。现该班已如期结束，回厂学员均保持受训时的学习情绪。
