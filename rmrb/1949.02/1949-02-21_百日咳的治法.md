Pertussis is prone to epidemics in winter and spring, and it mostly affects children under three years old. It starts with coughing, loss of appetite, sneezing, conjunctival congestion and swelling, and excessive tearing. After seven to ten days, the cough increases, and the cough is most severe, making it difficult to breathe (if the child appears dead for a moment, artificial respiration must be performed immediately). It gradually decreases after about six weeks; however, complications often begin at this time, the most common being tracheobronchial pneumonia.

Treatment: General treatment: Good rest is essential. When the weather is warm and windless, sunbathing is beneficial. Avoid irritants (smoke and bad odors, etc.). Eat more nutritious and easily digestible foods. Specific treatment: Inject vaccines or convalescent serum in the early stages. Drug treatment: Use sedatives, such as Compound Powder and Chloral Hydrate, once every night before bed. Traditional Chinese medicine treatment: (1) For runny nose, fever, and cough: Ephedra 1 qian, Perilla Leaf 1 qian, Apricot Kernel 2 qian, Gypsum 2 qian, Licorice 1 qian, Sichuan Fritillary 1 qian, Ginger 1 slice. (2) For spasmodic coughing, difficulty catching breath, and vomiting: Tangerine Peel 1 qian, Pinellia 1 qian, Bamboo Shavings 1 qian, Sichuan Fritillary 1.5 qian, Anemarrhena 1.5 qian, Perilla Fruit 1 qian, Tangerine Peel 1.5 qian. If the phlegm is thick and difficult to cough up, add Platycodon 1.5 qian. (3) For flushed face, red eyes, head tilted back, and tongue protruding: Bupleurum 1.5 qian, Scutellaria 2 qian, Pinellia 1.5 qian, Tangerine Peel 1 qian, Gypsum 2 qian, Rehmannia 1.5 qian, Ophiopogon 1 qian.

　　百日咳的治法
    百日咳冬春很容易流行。三岁以下的小孩发生的多。开始咳嗽，不想吃东西，打嚏喷，结合膜潮红肿胀，眼泪多，过七至十天后，咳嗽增多，咳嗽最重时喘不过气来（如一时死过去必须马上行人工呼吸）。约经六星期左右才逐渐减轻；但并发症往往由此时开始，最多见的是气管枝肺炎。
    治疗：一般治疗：要很好休息，天气暖无风时可晒暖。避免受刺激（烟和不好的气味等）。多吃养料多、容易消化的食品。特殊治疗：早期注射疫苗或恢复患后者的血清。药物治疗：用镇静药，如药剂和抱水格鲁拉儿，每晚临睡觉时吃一次。中医治法：（一）鼻流清涕、发热、咳嗽的用：麻黄一钱、苏叶一钱、杏仁二钱、石膏二钱、甘草一钱、川贝一钱、生姜一片。（二）一顿一顿的咳嗽，还不过气来，带呕吐的用：橘红一钱、清夏一钱、竹茹一钱、川贝一钱半、知母一钱半，苏子一钱、皮一钱半。痰粘稠难咳出加桔梗一钱半。（三）颜面潮红、两眼发赤、头向后仰、吐舌的用：柴胡钱半、黄芩二钱、清夏钱半、橘红一钱、石膏二钱、生地钱半、寸冬一钱。　　　以上各方用水煎服　　　冀中卫生局
