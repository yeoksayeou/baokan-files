Where Did the Fifty-Nine Red Flags Come From?
　　The Story of the Model Stretcher Brigade
　　　　Ruowang

　　The First Stretcher Brigade of the First District of Bohai recently received six red flags awarded by the East China Frontline Support Committee. Before this, they had already carried fifty-nine flags of various colors. If you ask where so many flags came from, the laborers would tell a vivid story about each flag.

　　　　A Widow's Flag for Them

　　When the Third Battalion of the First Stretcher Brigade of the First District of Bohai was stationed in Gaoshan Village, Jiaxiang County, Southwest Shandong, all the houses were closed as soon as they arrived in the village. It turned out that the villagers mistakenly thought that the "gangzi team" (local bandit armed forces of the Kuomintang reactionaries) had arrived, and they were all very scared. Wang Rulin's squad of the 11th Company lived in the home of a widow surnamed Gao. At that time, it was the autumn harvest season, and the ripe crops in the village were flooded in half a foot of water. The six members of the squad, fearing that the crops in the village would be ruined, took off their shoes and first harvested the widow's seven mu of sorghum and dried it on the field. The widow was overjoyed and hurried to pour wine for the laborers and prepared several dishes, but the laborers firmly refused to eat them. She was very surprised and said, "How can there be such good people in the world? It would cost fifteen silver dollars to hire someone and they wouldn't do as thorough a job as you." The laborers told her, "In our area, every village takes special care of widows, widowers, orphans, and the elderly, so we come out to fight and help the local orphans, elderly, weak, and poor wherever we go."

　　The widow had more than a hundred catties of tobacco leaves, but no one would sell them for her. The laborers said, "You come with us to the market, and we will carry the tobacco for you." The widow said, "No need for me to go, you sell it for me!" She also asked them to buy some wheat back after selling the tobacco leaves. The laborers did everything she asked and carefully calculated the accounts for her. The widow gratefully said, "You are so thoughtful, leave the remaining money for you to buy cigarettes!" The laborers didn't want a penny. The widow had no way to express her gratitude. Seeing that other families in the village were giving flags to the labor teams, she made a flag out of a piece of red cloth, exquisitely embroidered with lace, and asked someone to write "Gratitude Unforgettable" on it as a souvenir for the laborers.

　　　　They Are Really a Strange Bunch of People

　　The brigade was stationed in Xi Yidai, Jiaxiang County, for training. All the autumn crops in Shili Village were submerged in half a foot of water, and the villagers were worried that they could not harvest them. The laborers of the stretcher brigade, seeing that the crops would rot, mobilized the entire brigade to help the local residents harvest them. As a result, the crops were completely harvested to the field in three to five days. Poor families did not have livestock to thresh the grain, so the laborers, in groups of three or five, pulled the capstan with ropes. One landlord initially gave the laborers two leaky houses to live in. Seeing that the laborers had worked for him, he insisted that they move to the main room, but the laborers not only did not move to the main room but also helped the landlord repair the originally leaky houses very well. The landlord was so happy that he bought wine and meat to treat them and said with shame, "I was too blind before and didn't see that you were so kind." The laborers didn't eat his wine and food, but busily explained to him, "This is not your fault, it's all because of Chiang Kai-shek's troops, who make your scalp tingle as soon as you see the army. We came out to support the front line to defeat this kind of Kuomintang army that rapes, loots, and plunders. Chiang Kai-shek harms the people, we love the people, he kills people, we save people. We are naturally different from him!" Then one person said a sentence, and another person said a sentence, telling him about the situation in the old liberated areas.

　　The mill in Shili Village was ＠ by the laborers, many kitchen knives and scissors in Shili Village were sharpened by the laborers, many roofs in Shili Village had been re-mudded, and the mung beans and cotton in the fields were planted and watered by the laborers. Before dawn, the laborers also went to the fields to help the villagers beat indigo. After the work in the fields and on the threshing ground was finished, some braided ＠ fences for the landlords, some made ropes, and those who did not know how to do handicrafts formed groups to clean out cesspools. The carpentry squad of the battalion's administrative office repaired tables, chairs, benches, installed doors, and repaired pig pens for the villagers. The farmers said, "This is really a capable bunch of people." Originally, farmers had to provide a carpenter with enough food and drink, but the laborers did not bother them at all. They were not only capable people, but also a strange bunch of people! When the laborers left Shili Village, the whole village gave more than a dozen flags to the Fourth Battalion. Some were written with "Help Our Farmers," and some were written with "Labor Model." At the time of parting, the villagers sent them off with gongs and drums, and many landlords reluctantly sent them far away.

　　　　The Relationship Between the Laborers and Gao Diansheng

　　There was a small businessman named Gao Diansheng in Gaoshan Village, Jiaxiang County. As soon as the laborers entered the village, he cleverly locked the door of his small shop and left. Because the Chiang bandits had robbed his small shop before, when he suddenly saw such a group of people, each carrying a big stick, as if they were going to carry things or beat people in the village! The laborers waited at the door for him to open the door so that they could go in and live. They waited until dark. Gao Diansheng inquired from other places that these people did not rob or beat people, but were very peaceful, so he came back and opened the door, letting the laborers in to live.

　　The laborers lived in his home and helped him cut six mu of sorghum and one mu of grain in a few days, and he was very happy. One day he wanted to go to the market, and no one was home to watch the house, so he entrusted the laborers to do business in his small shop for him. Some of the laborers who knew how to keep accounts wrote down the daily income and expenditure clearly without any mistakes. Later, Gao Diansheng simply entrusted the small shop to the laborers and went to the market for four days. Squad leader Dong Dunlou was sick, and Gao Diansheng took care of him attentively. When the laborers were leaving, Gao Diansheng wrote the names and villages of the whole squad on the plaque in his shop with the words "Hidden Treasures," saying that it would be kept as a permanent souvenir. The laborers of the squad recalled this story and said with a smile, "This time we came out to support the front line, and we also served as deputy shopkeepers for a term!"

　　　　Capturing a Pseudo "Company Commander" to Eliminate Harm for the People

　　There is a small flag in the Third Battalion of the First Stretcher Brigade with the four characters "Eliminate Harm for the People" written on it. This flag leads to the following story. It turned out that the Third Battalion lived in Gaoshan Village. In the first few days, the villagers always looked at them askance, but only a cripple named Niu Zaigan talked and laughed with the laborers and was very affectionate. He liked to talk to the communication soldiers, asking about everything. The instructor was a little strange. He inquired from the villagers, but the villagers would not say anything. After the entire battalion helped the villagers with their work, the villagers were willing to tell the truth. They learned that he used to be a rogue and had colluded with the Chiang bandits' home-returning corps and the joint security office, and had even stored a gun for the home-returning corps. Later, they also learned that the gun he had stored had been handed over to the district office after the new liberation. The instructor studied that this person still had the possibility of being won over, so he sent someone to educate him, propagandize the lenient policy to him, and educate him with examples of the actual situation of how the liberated areas dealt with enemy and puppet personnel. Niu Zaigan also changed a bit after listening. One day, a person came from another village, and as soon as he saw the battalion headquarters of the Third Battalion, he ran away. Niu Zaigan limped over to report that this person was the company commander of the home-returning corps in Wenshang County, surnamed Zhang, and he was carrying a Mauser pistol. As soon as the laborers heard this, they quickly dispatched and arrested the "company commander." The villagers in this village who recognized him said, "This person killed someone in the village in front a few days ago!" The laborers sent the home-returning corps "company commander" to the county public security bureau for legal proceedings. The people in the nearby villages were overjoyed when they heard this news, and they all said that the laborers had eliminated a great harm for them. [Xinhua News Agency, East China, 11th]

　　五十九面红旗哪里来的？
  　模范担架团的故事
    若望
    渤海一分区第一担架团，最近得了华东支援前线委员会奖予的六面红旗。在这以前，他们早就扛着五十九面各色各样的旗子了。要问这么多的旗帜哪里来的？民工们曾指着每一面旗帜说出一个生动故事。
    　　　　寡妇送他们的旗子
    渤海一分区担架第一团第三营到鲁西南嘉祥县高山村驻防的时候，才到村庄，只见家家关门闭户。原来村民误以为是“杠子队”（国民党反动派地方土匪武装）来了，都很害怕。十一连王如林那一班住在一家姓高的寡妇家。那时候正逢秋收，该庄成熟的庄稼涝在半尺深的水里，该班六个人怕村中庄稼坏了，首先打赤脚去给寡妇把七亩高粱全割来家，在场上晒着。那寡妇这一下喜开了，赶忙给民工们打酒喝，还备了好几样菜，民工们坚决不吃。她非常奇怪说：“世界上那有这样好的人？要是雇个人要花十五块现洋也不跟你们做得扎实。”民工们就给她说：“我们那里，各个村子对鳏寡孤独都有特别照顾，所以我们出来参加打仗，到一个地方要帮助那个地方的孤寡老弱和贫民们。”
    寡妇存有一百多斤烟叶，没人给她卖。民工说：“你跟着我们去赶集，我们给你把烟挑着。”寡妇说：“不用我去了，你们给我卖了吧！”她还要求他们卖了烟叶再买点麦子回来。民工们都照办了，并且仔细地算帐给她听。寡妇感激地说：“你们这样周到，剩下的钱留给你们抽烟吧！”民工们一个钱也不要。寡妇没有办法来表示自己的感谢，看着村里旁人家给民工队送旗子，她也就用一块红布做了一面旗，精细的绣了花边，请人写了“感德不忘”四个字，送给民工们留作纪念。
    　　　　真是一帮奇怪的人
    该团驻在嘉祥县西一带整训，十里铺所有秋庄稼，淹没在半尺深的水中，村民都愁着没法子弄，担架团的民工们瞧着庄稼会沤坏，便全体动员起来，帮助当地居民收割，结果三五天就把庄稼完全割到场上。贫农家没有牲口打场，民工们就三个五个用绳子拉着辘轴。有一家房东起初把两间漏了屋顶的房子给民工住，看到民工给自己做了活，一定要他们搬到堂屋去，但民工们不但不搬到堂屋去，而且帮助房东把原来漏了的房子修得很好。房东喜的买酒买肉请他们，并且惭愧地说：“自己以前太瞎了眼，没有看出你们这样的善。”民工们没吃他的酒菜，却忙着给他解释：“这不能怪你，只怪蒋介石队伍害的，叫你们一看见了军队，头皮就发麻。我们就是为了打倒这种奸淫抢掠的国民党队伍才出来支援前线的。蒋介石是害民，我们是爱民，他是杀人，我们是救人。我们跟他自然不一样的！”接着这人一句，那人一句把老解放区的情形讲给他听。
    十里铺的磨是民工们给＠的，十里铺许多菜刀和剪刀是民工们给磨的，十里铺的许多屋顶都已经重新泥过，地里的绿豆、棉花是民工们种的，浇的。天不明，民工们还到地里帮助村人打靛。地里场上的活做完了，有的就给房东编＠篱，有的打绳子，不会手艺的就编起组来出粪坑。营里事务处的木工班，给村民修桌椅板凳，按门，修猪栏。农民说：“这真是一帮能人。”本来农民请个木匠总得管他酒足饭饱，但民工们一点也不叨扰，不但是能人，而且还是一帮奇怪的人咧！在民工们离开十里铺的时候，全村送给四营十多面旗子。有的写着“助我农民”，有的写着“劳动模范”。在分别的时候，全村村民打锣敲鼓送行，许多房东恋恋不舍的送出去很远。
    　　　　民工和高殿升的关系
    嘉祥县高山村有一个做小买卖的，名叫高殿升，民工们才进庄，他就很机灵的把他小店铺的门上了锁走了。因为以前蒋匪曾抢过他的小店，他一看忽然来了这么一帮人，每个人扛着一根大棍，好象要到村里来抬东西，或是打人哩！民工们在门口等着他来开门，好进去住。一直等到天黑，高殿升从旁的地方打听这些人不抢也不打人，怪和平，他也就回来开了门，让民工们进去住。
    民工们住到他家里，不几天帮他砍了六亩高粱，一亩谷子，他非常欢喜。有一天他要出去赶集，家里没人看家，他就托付民工在小店里给他代做买卖。民工们有会记帐的，把一天收支写得一清二楚不错分毫。后来高殿升就索性把小店托付给民工们，自己出去赶了四天集。班长董敦楼病了，高殿升悉意照顾他。民工们临走的时候，高殿升在自己店里写着“藏珍”两字的匾上，把全班的姓名村庄写在上头，说是留作永远纪念。该班民工们回忆起这段故事，笑着说：“这次出来支援前线，还当了一任二掌柜！”
    　　　　活捉伪“中队长”为民除害
    第一担架团第三营有一面小旗子，上面写着“为民除害”四个字。这旗子引出以下一段故事来。原来三营在高山村住着，开头几天，村民总是对他们侧目而视，惟有一个瘸子名叫牛在乾的对民工们有说有笑，十分亲热。他好找通讯员攀谈，问长问短。教导员有些奇怪，他向村民打听，村民都不说。到全营帮助村民劳动以后，村民都肯说实话了，才知道他以前是个流氓，和蒋匪还乡团及联保办事处上的人有勾连，并曾给还乡团存过一支枪。后来又了解，他所存的枪已经交给新解放以后的区公所了。教导员研究这个人还有争取的可能，于是派人教育他，给他宣传宽大政策，把解放区怎样对付敌伪人员的实际情形，举例来教育他。牛在乾听了也有点转变。有一天，从外村来了一个人，一看见三营的营部拔腿就跑。牛在乾瘸着腿来报告说：这个人就是汶上县还乡团的中队长，姓张，他带着一支二把匣子枪。民工们一听，就赶快出动把那个“中队长”逮住了。本村村民有认识他的，说：“这人头几天还在前边庄上杀过人！”民工们把这个还乡团“中队长”送到了县公安局去法办。附近村子的人民听得这个消息，莫不称快，认为民工们替他们除了一个大害。【新华社华东十一日电】
