Labor Daily Commentary

　　Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 14th: TASS reports: The Labor Daily recently published an article entitled "Changes on the Athens Stage," analyzing the recent reorganization of the Athens government, stating: The new cabinet's action plan can be deduced from its initial steps. Military censorship has been established, the large-scale execution of democrats is continuing, the terror of royalist fascists is intensifying, and negotiations for Greece to join the North Atlantic Treaty Organization have begun. The article points out that the American and British masters of the royalist fascists are trying to portray the recently established Athens puppet government as a broad coalition government and a government of national salvation. However, these cannot deceive the people of Greece and the world.

　　Note: The Athens puppet government has long been mired in a political crisis. Last autumn, the puppet government was "reorganized" once due to a "vote of no confidence" in parliament. In mid-January, the puppet Emperor Paul, at the behest of U.S. Ambassador to Greece Grady and British Minister of State Bevin, reorganized the government once again. The new government is still headed by Sophoulis of the Liberal Party. The cabinet includes representatives from the Liberal Party, the People's Party (i.e., the Royalist Party), the New Party, and the Allied Party. The position of Deputy Prime Minister, originally held by Costalas, the head of the People's Party, has been replaced by Diamedes, the former president of the "National Bank," while Costalas remains as Foreign Minister. After the formation of the new government, the political crisis has not been resolved, and the infighting between the parties in parliament that did not participate in the government and the government parties is intensifying day by day.

　　雅典伪政府改组骗不了希腊人民
  　劳动报评论
    【新华社陕北十四日电】塔斯社讯：劳动报最近发表题为“雅典舞台面的改变”一文，分析雅典政府最近的改组称：新内阁的行动计划，可从它最初的步骤去推断。军事检查制业已建立，大规模处死民主分子正在继续，保皇法西斯的恐怖正在加剧，希腊加入北大西洋公约的谈判业已开始。该文指出，保皇法西斯的美英主子们，力图把最近成立的雅典傀儡政府说成为广泛的联合政府和救国政府。然而，这些都骗不了希腊与全世界的人民。
    按：雅典伪政府长期陷于政治危机中。去年秋天，伪政府即因议会的“不信任”而“改组”一次。一月中旬，傀儡皇帝保罗王在美驻希大使格拉第、英国务大臣贝克尔的授意下，又一次改组政府。新政府仍以自由党的索福利斯为首，内阁中包括自由党、人民党（即保皇党）、新党及同盟党的代表，原为人民党首脑曹达利斯担任的副总理，改由前“国家银行”总裁狄亚米德继任，曹达利斯仍任外长。新政府组成后，政治危机并未解决，议会中未参加政府的各党派与政府党之间的倾轧更日益加甚。
