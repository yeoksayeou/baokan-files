　　Several Common Sense Points for Raising Livestock
　　Wang Gengnong, Agricultural College of Hua University

　　In rural areas, plowing fields and transportation mostly rely on livestock for assistance. If there are improper practices in the feeding, management, and use of livestock, they will get sick or even die. This is very detrimental to the development of production, so I have written the following points to discuss with everyone:

　　(1) The pens for horses, mules, donkeys, and cattle should not be too damp. Livestock should not be left in the open overnight as much as possible, otherwise they will get diseases that injure their waists and legs.

　　(2) If horses and mules are overloaded, walk too fast, and rest abruptly, they will get tendinitis and hoof pain.

　　(3) When livestock are exhausted from labor, and suffering from hunger and cold, and are breathing heavily, do not immediately give them water or feed, otherwise they will get gastrointestinal diseases.

　　(4) After livestock have eaten feed, do not give them too much water, as too much water will cause constipation. Do not give them too much water before eating grass, otherwise they will have diarrhea. It is also not good to drink water against the wind; they will cough when drinking.

　　(5) Do not let them stand in muddy places for too long, as livestock will develop hoof rot if they stand for too long. In summer, do not let livestock get rained on too much, as they will get sick more easily in the autumn. Do not feed them hot feed, as it will cause rough fur.

　　(6) When feeding livestock, do not feed them too much, otherwise their lungs will be injured. It is also not good to be too hungry, as their stomachs will be injured. It is also not good to eat too much frozen grass.

　　(7) If a horse has run a long distance, lead it around to walk more. Do not give it water or feed it anything until its sweat has subsided. Wait until the sweat has subsided before removing the saddle. If the body is broken, disinfect it and protect it from the wind to prevent tetanus.

　　If you pay attention to these things regularly, livestock can get sick less often.

　　饲养牲畜的几项常识
    华大农学院王耕农
    农村里，耕田、运输，大多依靠畜力来补助。如对牲畜饲养、管理、使用，有不得当的地方，就会生病，甚至死亡。这对发展生产有很大不利，所以我写出以下几点愿和大家研究：
    （一）马、骡、驴、牛的圈，不要太潮湿，牲畜夜间尽量不要露宿，不然要得腰腿受伤的病。
    （二）马、骡载重，走得太快，休息急，就会得筋炎，和蹄痛一类的病。
    （三）牲畜在劳动罢，饥冷交迫时，喘气大，不要马上饮喂，不然就会得肠胃病。
    （四）牲畜吃了料后，不要多喝水，多喝水就要得结症，没吃草前不要多喝水，不然要泻，迎风喝水也不好，喝时要咳嗽。
    （五）泥处不要多立，立久了，牲畜要生漏蹄，夏天不要使牲畜多淋雨，淋多了，秋天多生病。热料不要喂，喂了要燥毛。
    （六）饲牲畜时，不要太饱，不然肺要受伤，太饥了也不好，胃要受伤，冻草吃多了也不好。
    （七）马要跑了远路，牵它多走走，汗没落时不要饮水，或喂东西，等汗落了再去鞍，体部破了，要消毒避风，防止破伤风。
    经常注意这些，牲畜就可以少生病。
