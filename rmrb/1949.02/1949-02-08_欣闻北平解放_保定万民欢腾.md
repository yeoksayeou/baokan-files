[Jizhong Electric] When the news of the liberation of Beiping reached Baoding City, the propaganda team of the People's Education Center immediately rode their bicycles through the streets and alleys to spread the word. The blackboard newspaper prominently displayed the message "Beiping Liberated," and crowds gathered in front of the wall newspaper to read it aloud. The news instantly spread throughout schools, factories, and shops, and every household hung flags to celebrate. Railway worker Hao Binggui excitedly said, "Hey! That's great! Not a single stronghold (referring to Jiang bandit strongholds) was left for them. We'll have work to do (referring to repairing roads)!" A torchlight parade was held at night. Lanterns, torches, yangko dance teams, stilt walkers, lion dance troupes, etc., gathered from all directions under the guidance of large trucks, and then dispersed in all directions, like a river of fire. The sound of slogans accompanied by gongs and drums resounded through the sky, and the event did not disperse until 10 pm.

　　欣闻北平解放
  　保定万民欢腾
    【冀中电】当解放北平的消息传到了保定市后，民教馆的宣传队，马上骑上车子穿过大街小巷，展开宣传。黑板报大字写了“北平解放”的消息，人群拥挤在墙报前高声朗读。这消息刹那间传遍学校、工厂、商店，各家都悬旗庆祝。铁路工人郝丙贵欢欣的说：“嘿！真痛快，一个圪＠（指蒋匪据点）也没给他剩，咱可有活干了（指修路）”。夜晚举行火炬游行大会，灯笼、火把、秧歌队、高跷会、狮子会等，在大卡车的引导下，从四面八方集拢来，又向四外散去，象条火的奔流。锣鼓伴奏的口号声响彻云霄，至深夜十时始散。
