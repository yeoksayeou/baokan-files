　　Yangquan Investigates Iron Ore
    [Yangquan News] In order to better improve the supply of ironmaking raw materials, the Yangquan Municipal Committee of the Communist Party of China and the Municipal Government organized an investigation into the city's iron ore (iron ore is the ore used for melting iron) production and the operating conditions of iron ore kilns, in order to strengthen guidance on this work. In mid-December of last year, the Industry and Commerce Bureau first selected four cadres and the vocational high school selected fourteen students from the industrial and mining class to form an iron ore investigation team, which was dispatched to the ore-producing areas north of the Zhengtai Railway under the city's jurisdiction and the ore-producing areas near the city belonging to PindDing and Meng Counties to specifically investigate iron ore production. After more than twenty days of work, seventy-three villages including Yangshugou and Xinan Yu have now been investigated (including twenty villages under Pinding, ten villages under Meng County, and the remaining forty-three villages belonging to Yangquan City). There are currently 459 iron ore kilns in operation, with 2,217 workers, producing an average of 166 tons of iron ore per day. In the forty-three ore-producing villages belonging to Yangquan, there are currently 338 iron ore kilns in operation, with 1,609 workers, producing an average of 111 tons of iron ore per day, worth 519 shi of millet. The average daily miscellaneous expenses such as lamp oil, gunpowder, baskets, and ropes require approximately 138 shi of millet. On average, each worker can earn 2.38 sheng (市升, a unit of volume) of millet per day. In terms of operating methods, sixteen kilns are operated by the whole family without hiring labor, and 322 kilns are operated by workers in pure labor cooperation. In addition, there are twenty-one kilns that have suspended mining due to lack of funds and labor. The government has now dispatched another eight cadres to villages such as Wudu and Yan Kan to continue the investigation, and it is expected to complete the entire survey of the ore-producing areas under the city's jurisdiction by the end of January.
