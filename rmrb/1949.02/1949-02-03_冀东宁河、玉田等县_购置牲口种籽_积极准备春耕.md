[Jidong Dispatch] The county governments and banks of Yutian, Baodi, Ninghe, and other counties are actively helping the masses prepare seeds, purchase livestock and farm implements, and prepare to launch a spring plowing campaign. The Fifteenth Special District has allocated 130,000 catties of wheat seeds to help the masses in the flood-stricken areas of Yutian and Baodi counties solve the problem of spring wheat seeds, and has sent cadres to lead the masses in developing sideline production to earn money to exchange for wheat seeds. After the water was drained from the low-lying areas such as Lin Nancang in Yutian, the local people got rid of the water disasters of previous years. According to statistics from the Eighth District, 58 villages can sow 34,246 mu of spring wheat, accounting for one-quarter of the district's cultivated land area. Cadres used meetings such as joint village meetings, village cadre meetings, and mass meetings to overcome the idea of some people simply relying on government relief, and advocated solving the problem of wheat sowing by developing sideline production such as weaving mats and fishing. The most difficult Liu Tangzhuang can plant 868 mu of wheat. The problem of seeds for 526 mu will be solved by weaving mats and fishing. The government will lend wheat seeds to seven households of widowed and lonely people without labor. The 21 military families in Yuzhuang solved the problem of 650 catties of wheat seeds by weaving mats. As of now, 58 villages have exchanged with the government and purchased 28,772 catties of seeds themselves, which can plant 2,609 mu of wheat. The Bajianfang Village in the Tenth District grinds flour and weaves mats to exchange for 3,000 catties of wheat seeds, and all 800 mu of wheat land can be sown. Zang Zhiguo, the secretary of the village branch, proposed "Guarantee that all military families plant spring wheat." Under his leadership, he lent more than 100 catties of wheat seeds to two military families lacking seeds. Last year, the spring wheat in some villages in Baodi was sown late, and jaundice occurred before it matured, resulting in a large reduction in harvest. This year, the masses are preparing to plant early. In order to solve the difficulty of seeds, Chen Shanzhuang joined forces with Xiangfuzhuang, and 120 people organized two large fishing nets to fish in the low-lying areas, and divided 400 shi of red sorghum for solving the problem of wheat land seeds. The business office of the county bank focused on 24 villages in the five districts most severely affected by the Chiang Kai-shek disaster and floods and with the most severe shortage of livestock, and lent 100,000 yuan in Renminbi. The masses used the method of self-reporting and public discussion to determine 289 loan households, which can buy 179 heads of livestock. The masses are buying cloth to go to Rehe to exchange for livestock. The Ninghe County Bank Business Office corrected the past tendency of evenly distributing loans and lent 100,000 yuan in Renminbi twice, and drove a large amount of private capital to organize the purchase of livestock. Balizhuang obtained a loan of 1,800 yuan in Renminbi, and the masses raised another 20,000 yuan in shares and have bought back 10 heads of livestock. The villages in the seventh district along the Su Canal in the county obtained a loan of 50,000 yuan, and the masses plan to build 11 animal-powered waterwheels and 60 manual waterwheels to prepare for water conservancy. The Xinglong Bank Business Office distributed agricultural loans for the purchase of 500 farm implements, 50 shi of yam seeds, 15 shi (26 catties per dou) of wheat and bean seeds, and 400,000 sweet potato seedlings, and selectively lent them to the masses in six districts according to the actual situation.

    【冀东电】玉田、宝坻、宁河等县政府、银行帮助群众积极准备种籽、购买牲口、农具，准备开展春耕运动。十五专署为帮助玉田、宝坻两县遭水灾区群众解决春麦种籽问题，特拨麦种十三万斤，并派干部领导群众开展副业生产，赚钱换麦种。玉田林南仓等洼，泄水出洼后，当地群众摆脱历年水患，据八区统计，即有五十八个村可播种春麦三万四千二百四十六亩，占全区耕地面积四分之一。干部通过联村会、村干部会、群众大会等会议，克服某些群众单纯依赖政府救济的思想，提倡以开展织席、捕鱼等副业生产解决种麦问题。最困难的刘唐庄能种麦八百六十八亩，由织席、捕鱼解决五百廿六亩种籽，七户无劳力孤寡户麦种则由政府贷给。于桩廿一户军属以织席解决麦种六百五十斤。截至目前，五十八个村已向政府兑换及自己购买种籽二万八千七百七十二斤，能种麦二千六百零九亩。十区八间房村磨面织席换麦种三千斤，八百亩麦地均能播种。该村支部书记藏志国提出“保证军属都种上春麦”，在他带头下借给两户缺种籽军属麦种百余斤。宝坻一部村庄去年春麦播种较晚，未成熟时即生了疸病，收成大减。今年群众都准备早种。陈山庄为解决种籽困难，与香福庄结伙，由一百二十人组织两付大鱼网去洼地捕鱼，分得红高粮四百石，作为解决麦地种籽之用。该县银行营业所，以遭受蒋灾、水灾最严重缺牲口最多的五个区中二十四个村为重点，贷给人民币十万元，群众以自报公议办法，确定受贷户二百八十九户，可买牲口一百七十九头。群众正买布去热河换回牲畜。宁河县银行营业所纠正过去平均分散使用贷款的偏向，两次贷出人民币十万元，并带动起大批私人资金，组织购买牲畜。八里庄获贷款人民币一千八百元，群众又集股二万元，已买回牲畜十头。该县沿苏运河岸七区各村，获贷款五万元，群众计划打畜力水车十一辆，人力水车六十辆，准备开展水利。兴隆银行营业所将农业贷款分别购置农具五百件，山药种五十石，小麦、豆种十五石（每斗二十六斤），白薯秧四十万棵，根据实际情况有重点的分别贷给六个区群众。
