　　Youths from All Circles in Beiping and Tianjin
  　Enthusiastically Apply to Renmin University
  　Representatives to the National Student Congress Arrive in Beiping One After Another
    [Beiping Dispatch] Youths in Beiping are enthusiastically applying to Renmin University. Since the 15th of this month, there has been a continuous stream of young people applying to the North China People's Revolutionary University, the North China Military and Political University of the Chinese People's Liberation Army, and North China University. In just four days, the number of young people applying to the North China People's Revolutionary University reached 2,860. Students accounted for more than 50% of these, with the remainder being teachers, staff, workers, and merchants. When the school held its first examination on the 18th, it broke with old traditions by allowing applicants to bring reference books and dictionaries. This move was very popular among young people.
    [Xinhua News Agency, Beiping, 23rd] The Tianjin Office of the Joint Enrollment Committee of North China University, North China People's Revolutionary University, and North China Military and Political University began enrolling students in Tianjin on the 17th, and more than 1,000 young people applied on that day. In addition, the preparatory committee of the Tianjin Municipal Democratic Youth Federation has organized the registration of out-of-school and unemployed youth to help solve the difficulties of young people in obtaining education and employment. From the 12th to the 15th, within four days, 630 young people have registered. Among them, 101 have been introduced by the federation to work or study in various military and political organs, bookstores, training classes, and other departments, according to their needs and specialties.
    [Beiping, 18th] Representatives from various regions attending the National Student Congress of China have begun to arrive in Beiping. Twelve student representatives from Shanghai in the Jiang-controlled areas and two representatives from Jinnan in the liberated areas reported to the congress preparatory office on the 17th and 18th respectively.
    There are a total of sixteen student representatives from Shanghai. In addition to the twelve who have already reported, the other four are still on their way. The twelve who have reported include students from Jiaotong University, St. John's University, Fudan University, Soochow University, Great China University, Shanghai Law College, Shanghai Municipal Women's Normal School, Nanyang Model Middle School, and other schools. These student representatives from the Jiang-controlled areas, who have suffered persecution by the Kuomintang, attended the North China Student Congress and participated in the mass rally of 60,000 people in Shijiazhuang celebrating the liberation of Beiping and Tianjin after entering the liberated areas. Seeing that the people in the liberated areas have already gained democracy and freedom, while the students in the Jiang-controlled areas are still suffering, their words and expressions revealed boundless excitement.
    [Tianjin, 20th] The fifteen student representatives from the Central Plains Liberated Area Student Federation attending the National Student Congress, led by Ding Li, chairman of the Central Plains Student Federation, arrived in Tianjin on the evening of the 18th. They originally planned to proceed to Beiping on the 19th, but in order to have a get-together with the Tianjin Municipal Student Federation and brothers and sisters from Nankai and other major middle schools, and to visit major factories such as the China Textile Corporation, they changed their departure date to the 21st.
    [Xinhua News Agency, Beiping, 22nd] With the help of the People's Government and the preparatory committee of the Beiping Municipal Student Federation, Northeast students who were coerced into coming to Beiping by the Kuomintang bandit gang are now beginning to return to their hometowns. The 520 students and 88 faculty and staff members of Shenyang Medical College, along with their families, left Beiping on the morning of the 21st by the Beining Railway free of charge. Accompanying them were twelve advance representatives from other colleges and universities in the Northeast. The second group of teachers and students from Liaohai Merchant Marine College and the Faculty of Arts and Law of Northeast University, who are preparing to return, are also scheduled to depart within the next few days. The People's Government is providing each teacher and student returning to the Northeast with travel expenses of 210 yuan in Renminbi.
