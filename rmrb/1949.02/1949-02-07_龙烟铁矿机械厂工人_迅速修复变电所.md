　　Workers at Longyan Iron Mine Machinery Factory
  　Rapidly Repair Substation
    [Zhangjiakou Telegram] The substation of the Longyan Iron Mine Machinery Factory in Xuanhua, during the Kuomintang bandit army's rule, took several months to repair without restoring power. However, after liberation, thanks to the meticulous research and active work of workers like Sun Jing from the factory, power was restored in just seven days. During the Kuomintang bandit army's rule, when renovating the factory's substation, the workers knew that the installation method directed by the bandit army's engineer would not restore power and was dangerous. However, they held the attitude of "the worse, the better" and did not offer suggestions for improvement, so that it could not be powered on until liberation. After liberation, the People's Government immediately sent personnel to take over and convened electrical workers to discuss whether the substation could be powered on. At that time, the workers all answered resolutely, "Yes." Sun Jing said, "In the past, we muddled through each day, but today we are working for ourselves." They immediately researched and came up with a solution, and then worked hard, voluntarily extending their working hours. They re-repaired the high-voltage automatic switch, appropriately moved the high-voltage power switch, re-rectified two transformers, repaired the voltmeter and ammeter, and configured high-voltage and low-voltage lines. In just seven days, they successfully restored power.

　　龙烟铁矿机械厂工人
  　迅速修复变电所
    【张垣电】宣化龙烟铁矿机械厂的变电所，在国民党匪军统治期间，费了好几个月的功夫修理也没有恢复送电；但解放后，由于该厂工人孙敬等细心钻研、积极工作的结果，仅仅七天时间即恢复送电了。国民党匪军统治期间，装修该厂变电所时，工人们虽然知道那个匪军派来的工程师所指挥的装置办法不能送电，且有危险，但他们却抱着“坏了才好”的态度，不提供他改进的意见，以致直到此次解放时还不能送电。解放后，人民政府当即派员接管，并召开电器工人商量能不能使变电所送电，当时工人们都斩钉截铁的回答：“能”。孙敬身说：“过去混一天说一天，今天是给自己工作了。”他们马上就研究，想出了办法，随后就紧张地工作起来，并自动延长了工作时间。他们重新修理了高压自动开闭器，适当移动了高压电力开闭器，重整了两个变压器，擦修了电压表和电流表，配置了高压、低压线，只用了七天即顺利的送电了。
