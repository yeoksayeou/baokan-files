Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 15th: Điện Tín xã Prague, 10th: Czechoslovak Premier Zápotocký stated at the closing session of the Central Committee of the Trade Union Council that "observing production order" is the main slogan of the current stage of Czechoslovakia's Five-Year Plan. "Observing production order" includes the proper use of technology, saving production tools and raw materials, eliminating worker mobility, eliminating overtime work where possible, and preventing those centralizing practices that would cause industrial bureaucracy. Zápotocký clearly pointed out that the living standards of workers are now higher than before the war. In 1937, more than three-quarters of the country's workers earned less than 750 Czech crowns per month. Today, only 29.5 percent of all Czech workers earn 2,250 Czech crowns or less per month. The real wages of female workers and workers' subsidies have also increased significantly. By the end of this year, more than 800,000 people will be receiving old-age and disability pensions. The minimum amount of assistance is more than fifteen times higher than in 1937. After describing these achievements, Zápotocký pointed out that it would not have been possible to complete the Two-Year Plan and improve living standards without the leadership of the Communist Party. Speaking of the claim that trade unions are destroying small handicraftsmen and small businessmen, Zápotocký stated that small businesses and small production are important, but large-scale production is the key to a better future. The situation of small handicraftsmen is much better than before the war. Before the war, there were thousands of bankruptcies of small handicraftsmen every year. Today, this kind of thing does not exist. Small handicraftsmen can work and make a living well, but on the whole, they cannot be relied upon as the pillar of efforts to build socialism. Building socialism must rely on the workers. That is why they enjoy special protection.

　　捷克总理萨波托斯基
  　号召遵守生产秩序
    指出建设社会主义要依靠工人
    【新华社陕北十五日电】电通社布拉格十日讯：捷克斯洛伐克总理萨波托斯基，在此间职工会中央委员会全会末次会议上说：“遵守生产秩序”是捷克斯洛伐克五年计划现阶段的主要口号。“遵守生产秩序”包括适当使用技术、节省生产工具与原料、消除工人流动性、在可能的地方消除逾时工作与防止那些会引起工业官僚主义化的集权主义的作法。萨波托斯基明白地指出：现在工人生活标准较战前提高了。在一九三七年，全国有四分之三以上的工人每月工资不到七百五十捷币。而今天，工人每月工资二千二百五十捷币或不及此数的，仅占全捷工人百分之二十九点五。女工的实际工资与工人的扶助金也同样显著地增加了。到今年年底将有八十万以上的人领取养老与残废抚恤金。最低额的扶助金，都较一九三七年超出十五倍。萨波托斯基在叙述了这些成就之后，指明：假如没有共产党的领导，就不可能完成二年计划和提高生活标准。萨波托斯基在谈到有人说职工会是摧毁小手工业者与小商人时声称：小商业与小生产是重要的，但大生产是达到美好未来的关键。小手工业者的情况较战前是好得多了。战前，每年都有成千桩小手工业者破产的事件。而今天，这类事情是没有了。小手工业者可以好好地工作和谋生，但整个说来，不能倚靠他们为努力建设社会主义的支柱。建设社会主义要依靠工人。这便是为什么他们享受到特别保护的原因。
