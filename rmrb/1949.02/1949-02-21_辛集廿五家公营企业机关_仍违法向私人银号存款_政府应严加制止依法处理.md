[JiZhong Electric] Twenty-five state-owned factories, shops, and production departments in Xinji City are illegally depositing money in private banks, fueling the activities of speculative merchants, increasing speculative capital in the market, and causing market chaos. On January 15th, the Xinji Office of the People's Bank of China, in conjunction with the Municipal Bureau of Industry and Commerce, inspected the private Dazhong Bank's public enterprise deposits. The person in charge of the bank cunningly deceived the government, concealing the information, and attempting to continue absorbing public enterprise deposits. However, a review of the accounts revealed that in January, there were still ten state-owned enterprises and institutional production departments with deposits not yet withdrawn from the bank, amounting to 541,424.90 yuan (People's Currency, same below). This included 110,793.50 yuan from the Zhengtai Coal and Iron Company, 4,000 yuan from the Jizhong Transportation Company, 56,434.50 yuan from the North China Trading Company's Hongyuan Fur Warehouse, 90,900 yuan from the Shijiazhuang Supply Office's Xingchang Leather Factory, 104,500 yuan from the Jizhong Trade Union's Gunny Bag Factory, 130,130 yuan from the Jizhong Party School's Yihe Coal Yard, 19,446.40 yuan from the Jizhong Trade Union's Workers' Cooperative, 5,800 yuan from the Shijiazhuang Supply Office's Xingmao Felt Workshop, 24,590 yuan from the Jizhong Trade Union's Workers' Cooperative Shoe Factory, and 50.50 yuan from the Jizhong Post Office's Tongqingxiang Carriage Shop. Furthermore, since August of last year, sixteen public enterprises and institutional production departments had deposit payments and overdraft relationships with the bank. The deposits have now been frozen pending disposal. During this period, illegal elements at the Dazhong Bank secretly engaged in divisive and disruptive activities, arbitrarily allowing the Zhongxing Coal and Iron Yard to withdraw frozen deposits, fabricating stories that Zhongxing had forced the withdrawal, and encouraging Zhongxing by saying, "The Xingchang Leather Factory has opinions about the bank freezing their deposits and wants to sue the government." They also falsely accused the bank of "monopolizing the banking industry," stirring up discord between the bank and public enterprises. The inspection of Dazhong Bank revealed that although the bank verbally claimed to be under the guidance of the banking industry, it actually illegally absorbed public enterprise deposits and helped private merchants engage in speculative activities. In December, when the prices of oil, grain, and cotton soared, the bank, in order to tighten the money supply, stopped lending, while Dazhong Bank, from December 2nd to 14th, released 381,817.70 yuan in twelve days, greatly fueling private merchant speculation. Taking advantage of the bank's suspension of lending, it also courted some untrustworthy merchants who were overdue on their bank loans, encouraging them to deposit their money in Dazhong Bank to jointly engage in speculative activities. Twenty-three private merchants were found to owe the bank 262,123.20 yuan while depositing 209,226.60 yuan in Dazhong Bank. The above-mentioned adverse consequences were caused by the fact that state-owned enterprises and institutional production departments disregarded the law, violated policies, and arbitrarily deposited funds in private banks, resulting in an increase in speculative capital in the market and affecting market chaos; at the same time, the bank leadership's thinking was paralyzed, and the bank's operations were not promptly inspected; and the Xinji Municipal Government's administrative management was lax. Afterwards, the government convened a meeting of deposit holders who had illegally deposited money in private banks. Some state-owned factories and shops still adopted a stubborn attitude, failing to attend the meeting or sending staff members to listen to the meeting, and showing an extremely erroneous attitude of refusing to make a sincere review regardless of the punishment. The government should order the persons in charge of each state-owned enterprise to conduct a profound review, and give warnings, restrictions, or punishments, as appropriate, to Dazhong Bank for deceiving the government and engaging in speculative and disruptive activities by colluding with private merchants.

　　辛集廿五家公营企业机关
  　仍违法向私人银号存款
    政府应严加制止依法处理
    【冀中电】辛集市二十五家国营工厂、商店及机关生产部门，违法向私人银号存款，助长投机商人活动，增加市场投机资本，造成市场混乱恶果。一月十五日中国人民银行辛集办事处协同市政府工商管理局，到私营大众银号检查公营企业存款，该号负责人却狡猾地欺骗政府，隐瞒不报，企图继续吸收公营企业存款。但在审查帐目中，发现一月份存入该银号未支款之国营企业与机关生产部门，尚有十家，款额达五十四万一千四百二十四元九角（人民券下同），计正太煤铁公司一十一万七百九十三元五角，冀中运输公司四千元，华北贸易公司宏沅皮毛栈五万六千四百三十四元五角，石门供给处兴昌皮件厂九万九百元，冀中工会麻袋厂十万四千五百元，冀中党校义合煤栈一十三万一百三十元，冀中工会工人合作社一万九千四百四十六元四角，石门供给处兴茂毡坊五千八百元，冀中工会工人合作社鞋厂二万四千五百九十元，冀中邮局同庆祥车行五十元五角。还有自去年八月以后到今年，公营企业与机关生产部门与该银号有存款支付与来往透支关系者达十六家。现已把存款冻结，听候处理。在此期间大众银号不法分子，在暗中进行挑拨破坏活动，擅自让中兴煤铁栈支走已冻结之存款，并捏造说中兴强迫把款提走，并到中兴鼓励说：“兴昌皮厂对银行冻结他们的银号存款有意见，要到政府打官司。”并诬蔑银行“把银号垄断起来”。挑拨银行与公营企业之关系。从检查大众银号看出该号虽然口头上在银行业务指导之下，实际违法吸收公营企业存款，帮助私商进行投机活动，十二月份油粮棉暴涨，银行为紧缩货币停止放款，而该号则从十二月二日至十四日十二天中，就放出三十八万一千八百一十七元七角，大大的助长了私商投机活动。并乘银行停止放款的空隙，拉拢一些不守信用欠银行款到期不还的商人，使其将银行款存入银号，共同进行投机活动，被检查出来者二十三户私商，欠银行廿六万二千一百廿三元二角，而存在银号廿万九千二百廿六元六角。造成以上恶果的原因是各国营企业及机关生产部门目无法律，破坏政策，擅自存入银号款项，致使增加市场投机资本，而影响市场混乱；同时银行领导思想麻痹，对银号业务未能及时检查；以及辛集市政府行政管理松弛所致。事后政府召开违法向银号存款户会议，有的国营工厂商店尚持顽抗态度，开会不到，派职员听会，任凭处理不作虚心检讨等极端错误态度，政府应责成各国营企业负责人深刻检讨，对大众银号欺骗政府、拉拢私商进行投机破坏行为，酌情给以警告、限制或处分。
