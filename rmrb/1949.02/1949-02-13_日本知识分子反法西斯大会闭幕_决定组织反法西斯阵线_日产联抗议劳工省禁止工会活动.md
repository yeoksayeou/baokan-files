TASS, Tokyo Dispatch: The Japan Industry Union Federation has lodged a protest with the Ministry of Labor against the "Notice Requiring Strict Enforcement of Union Qualification Conditions" issued by the Ministry of Labor on February 3rd. The protest condemns the Ministry of Labor's notice as an attempt to suppress trade unions in order to pave the way for unfavorable amendments to existing labor legislation. The Japan Industry Union Federation demands that the Ministry of Labor immediately revoke this notice. According to the Japan Times, the Japanese Ministry of Labor issued an order in March to dissolve all "bad" or "unqualified" trade unions throughout the country.

    【新华社陕北十一日电】电通社东京讯：最近在此间举行的日本知识分子反法西斯大会已经闭幕。到会代表共七百人，其中有作家、评论家、艺术家、音乐家与电影工作者。大会通电给全世界知识分子称：法西斯主义又在威胁日本，日本知识分子正在进行反法西斯主义的斗争。大会表示有坚强的决心，使日本恢复为民主国家，这将使日本对全人类的普遍和平与进步能有所贡献。代表们保证，要与全世界的进步知识分子密切合作，并敦促他们给日本进步的知识分子以一切援助。大会一致决定，组织争取自由和平的反法西斯阵线，并正式决定赞成共产党、工农党与社会党团结。
    【新华社陕北十一日电】塔斯社东京讯：日本全国产业劳动组合联合会已向劳工省提出抗议，反对二月三日劳工省所发表的“要求严格执行工会合格条件”的通告。抗议书谴责劳工省的通告乃力图镇压各职工会，以便给对现存劳工立法作不利于工人的修改，铺设道路。日本产联要求劳工省立即撤销这个通告。据日本时报载称，日本劳工省于三月曾下令解散各地一切“不良的”即“不合格”的职工会。根据该命令，进行政治活动或将其一大部分基金从事政治活动的职工会，必须加以取缔。
