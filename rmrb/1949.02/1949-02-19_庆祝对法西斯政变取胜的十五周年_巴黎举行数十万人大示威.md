Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 17th: According to TASS, Paris held a massive demonstration on the 13th, attended by hundreds of thousands of people, to celebrate the fifteenth anniversary of the victory of the French working people and democrats over the fascist coup. The marching contingent included the French Communist Party, the French General Confederation of Labor, the Unified Socialist Party (Note: This party was originally a component of the French Socialist Party. Dissatisfied with the reactionary policies of the right-wing leadership of the Socialist Party, it declared a split from the Socialist Party at the end of September last year and formed the separate Unified Socialist Party, with Blancour as its General Secretary.), the Society of Fighters for Peace and Freedom, the French Women's Federation, resistance movements and veterans organizations, and the people of Paris. They demanded peace, opposed warmongers, and strived for national independence, the realization of the vital demands of the working people, and peace in Vietnam. The demonstrators held red flags and huge banners with the inscriptions: "The French will never fight the Soviet Union!" "Down with the Atlantic Pact!" "Down with the Marshall Plan!" "Salute the Soviet Union, the great fortress of peace in the world!" "Thank you, Stalin, for safeguarding peace!" Throughout the entire route from the Bastille to the Place de la République, the demonstration was surrounded by tens of thousands of Parisians, who, on this anniversary, clearly expressed their will to unite and struggle for democratic peace and against the instigators of a new war.
