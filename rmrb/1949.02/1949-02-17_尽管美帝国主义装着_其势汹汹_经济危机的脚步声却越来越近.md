　　Despite the US Imperialists Putting on a Show of "Formidable Strength,"
    The Footsteps of Economic Crisis are Getting Closer
    On January 30th and 31st, the Central Committee of the Greek Communist Party held its Fifth Plenary Session in the Grammos Mountains in northwestern Greece. This plenary session was convened in a situation where the Greek Democratic Army will achieve a decisive victory this year. After discussing the situation before the turning point of the Greek liberation war towards a decisive victory, the plenary session pointed out two basic characteristics of the current situation in Greece: one is that the national military initiative has been transferred to the hands of the Democratic Army; the other is that the rule of the Athenian puppet dynasty of the United States has further disintegrated. The financial economy is deteriorating, the military crisis is deepening, and the military command of the head of the US military delegation, Follett, has completely failed. The plenary session passed an important resolution criticizing right-leaning and opportunistic tendencies within the party, pointing out that this tendency is mainly manifested in the erroneous view that "it is impossible to form a regular army without foreign aid, and small guerrilla groups should be used instead of a revolutionary regular army." The resolution analyzed that "the spread of these right-leaning and opportunistic tendencies is the result of external influences hostile to the Greek national liberation struggle and the ideological pressure exerted by the imperialist and war camps." The resolution criticized the right-leaning line of the party leadership during the German occupation, which deviated from Lenin-Stalinism, and criticized the opportunistic influence that infiltrated the Athens branch of the Political Bureau, thereby "adopting a compromising attitude towards the royalist fascist terror." The resolution cleared away the "fear of America" and confidently pointed out that although the United States is openly interfering and its army is participating in combat, if all Communists complete their tasks well, the royalist fascists and the United States and Britain can be defeated. The resolution stipulated many new policies: "Intentional anti-people actions are not allowed," "Arbitrary destruction of captured towns and confiscation of the property of small merchants and artisans are not allowed," "Democratic groups should be formed within the royalist fascist army," "Crush narrow-minded national chauvinism." At the same time, the plenary session elected a new Political Bureau headed by Greek Communist Party General Secretary Zachariadis; and announced that General Markos, commander of the Greek Democratic Army, and another member of the Political Bureau, were relieved of their duties due to serious illness.
    After the US reactionary government openly rejected Stalin's proposal for negotiations on a peace treaty, it is stepping up its aggressive plan, the "North Atlantic Alliance," which endangers world peace and attempts to dominate the world. On the one hand, the US government began secret meetings on the 8th with representatives of the six countries participating in the "Alliance": Britain, France, Canada, the Netherlands, Belgium, and Luxembourg; on the other hand, the United States is driving the three Nordic countries of Norway, Denmark, and Sweden to join this "Alliance." In order to resolutely oppose the imperialist policy of aggression, the Soviet government issued a second statement to the Norwegian government on the 5th, suggesting the conclusion of a Soviet-Norwegian non-aggression treaty, exposing the Norwegian side's excuse of "possible attacks from the Soviet Union." But what is the Norwegian government currently enthusiastic about? Is the fact not better than sophistry? Norwegian Foreign Minister Lange, while claiming that "the Soviet statement will be given more appropriate study," hurriedly set off for Washington a few hours after receiving the Soviet statement, wanting to taste some of the bait of "military aid" and get caught on the hook that reduces itself to a US military captive. However, when participating in this aggressive "Alliance," the ruling groups of the three Nordic countries cannot but consider the favorable relationship that the Soviet Union has with them, and they cannot but consider the angry emotions of their own people who are loudly opposing participation in the "Alliance." This is where the United States first ran into a wall in Sweden. Swedish Foreign Minister Undén and Prime Minister Erlander issued statements on the 9th, "refusing to unite with the countries of the Atlantic Pact."
    However, although US imperialism is still putting on a show of "formidable strength," the true face of this paper tiger is being exposed day by day. The footsteps of the US economic crisis are getting closer and closer. The wholesale prices of US agricultural products and some daily consumer goods, as well as stock prices, plummeted starting on the 4th. Prices of grains, meat, wool, rubber, cotton, soap, etc., all fell sharply. In Chicago, corn fell by 5.5 to 7.7 cents per bushel (about 3.4 liters) in April, and then fell by 2 to 3 cents on the 7th. Cotton in New York fell by $1.25 per bale on the 4th. It continued to fall by $1.20 to $1.85 on the 7th. The Associated Press index of 35 commodity prices has fallen to its lowest point in the past two years, falling more than 26 points from February of last year to now. Some stocks in New York fell by $5 per share on the 4th. It continued to fall on the 7th. On the 10th, US stock trading had fallen to its lowest level in a year. Since the sharp fall in US agricultural product prices last February, it has continued to fluctuate. Although it once rebounded from April to July last year due to the adoption of many artificial measures, it has continued to fall back since August, and this decline has changed from slow to rapid since the beginning of this month on the 4th. This makes all US entrepreneurs have to "closely watch it as a clue to future development" (Associated Press). The re-sharp fall in US prices is the result of the rapid development of the US relative overproduction crisis. Although US imperialism has adopted the two magic weapons of stepping up foreign expansion and the arms race to seek markets for its surplus commodities, facts have proved that they are not very useful. The Marshall Plan's $7 billion foreign "aid" plan did not save the crisis of the shrinking US foreign market. Even according to US official statistics, the total value of US exports in 1948 at most could not exceed 12.5 billion US dollars, a drop of more than one-fifth compared with 15.3 billion US dollars in 1947. If you count the soaring prices, the actual decline is even greater. The inability to sell goods has caused the inventory piled up in US warehouses to reach a high record of 54.4 billion US dollars in December last year, an increase of 20 billion US dollars compared with the previous year. This relative overproduction is the basic reason for this sharp drop in prices. Relative overproduction has triggered a wave of production reductions and business closures. According to the New York Times: Following the reduction in production in the cotton textile, shoemaking, sock making, rubber, glass, truck, radio, and electric refrigerator industries, the hardware manufacturing industry in many industrial centers has also reduced production by 5% to 15%. Moreover, this reduction in production in some areas has reached a dangerous level. At the same time, the US Department of Agriculture has been urging farmers to plant less wheat, cotton, and potatoes this year. The result of the widespread reduction in production is that a larger number of workers are thrown into the streets. The US official admits that the number of unemployed people in January this year has increased sharply by 700,000. The volcano of the US economic crisis has begun to shake, which is one of the fundamental reasons why US imperialism is desperately stepping up its aggressive plans.
    The arrogant plan of the American, British, and Dutch labor traitors to abolish the World Federation of Trade Unions has failed. Since the reactionary representatives of the trade unions of the United States, Britain, and the Netherlands announced their withdrawal from the World Federation of Trade Unions on January 17, the Executive Committee of the World Federation of Trade Unions immediately held a meeting in Paris from January 28 to February 1, according to the decision of the Executive Bureau of the World Federation of Trade Unions. Attending the meeting were representatives of 62 million organized workers from five continents. Representatives representing the interests of millions of workers in the British Commonwealth also disregarded the split attempts of the heads of the British Trades Union Congress and traveled far to attend the meeting. The meeting resolutely rejected the proposal of the Standing Committee of the British Trades Union Congress to demand that the World Federation of Trade Unions stop its activities, and announced that the Executive Committee will continue to perform its duties: mobilizing the world's workers to fight against new wars and for lasting peace, and to defend workers' rights and eliminate the remnants of fascism. After abandoning the splitters, the World Federation of Trade Unions smoothly decided to convene the Second Congress of the World Federation of Trade Unions in Italy in June, the Preparatory Committee of the Asian Trade Union Congress in New Beiping, China in May, and entrusted the Chinese representative Liu Ningyi to draft a plan for joint action between the All-China Federation of Trade Unions and the trade unions affiliated to the World Federation of Trade Unions. The meeting also elected Vittorio, General Secretary of the Italian General Confederation of Labor, as the new Chairman of the World Federation of Trade Unions, to replace the former Chairman Deakin, General Secretary of the British Trades Union Congress, who has become a poor failure who rolled out of the door of the World Federation of Trade Unions. This split and betrayal of the reactionary heads of the trade unions of the United States, Britain, and the Netherlands, has not only been rejected by the World Federation of Trade Unions, but also angered the advanced workers in these countries. The Scottish branch of the National Union of Mineworkers of Great Britain and many other local trade unions in Britain, the United Packinghouse Workers of America and other five trade unions, the Netherlands Trade Union Federation, etc., have issued a wave of protests.
    Other important international events recently are as follows:
    (1) In the face of the continued rise of revolutionary forces in Burma, the reactionary Burmese rule is disintegrating and internal strife is intensifying. The Karen "rebellion" originally instigated by Britain in September of last year has greatly developed recently, promoting the crisis of the reactionary rule of Thaksin Nu. The "rebels" have continuously captured cities and lands, and are engaged in fierce battles with government forces on the outskirts of Yangon.
    (2) The British authorities in Malaya unreasonably arrested another 630 overseas Chinese on the 6th. Since the promulgation of the anti-Chinese "New Emergency Regulations" on January 10, more than 1,700 overseas Chinese have been arrested.
    (3) The strike movement in Italy is surging. Workers in Milan, Turin and other places held general strikes on the 11th and 9th respectively, protesting against the factory owners' breach of their promise to recognize the factory committee. Workers in many other places in northern Italy, national bank employees, and national miners have all held strikes, demanding increased wages and other demands. The strike is continuing to expand.
    (4) Hungary recently cracked a treasonous conspiracy case under the direction of the United States. The principal offender, Mindszenty, was sentenced to life imprisonment on the 8th. US Vice Consul Stasi and others were expelled for espionage and smuggling traitors out of the country. (Xinhua News Agency, northern Shaanxi, 15th)

### 尽管美帝国主义装着“其势汹汹”  经济危机的脚步声却越来越近

　　尽管美帝国主义装着“其势汹汹”
    经济危机的脚步声却越来越近
    一月三十和三十一两日，希腊共产党中央在希腊西北部的格拉姆斯山区，举行了第五届全会。这届全会是在希腊民主军将在今年取得决定性胜利的情况下召开的。全会讨论了希腊解放战争在走向决定性胜利的转折点到来前的形势以后，指出了当前希腊形势的两个基本特点，一个是全国的军事主动权已经转入民主军手中。另一个是美国的奴才雅典小皇朝的统治已进一步地土崩瓦解。财政经济越益恶化，军事危机更加深重，美国军事代表团团长佛立特的军事指挥已完全失败。全会通过了批评党内右倾和机会主义偏向的重要决定，指出这种偏向主要表现在认为“没有外援不可能组成正规军，并且应以小股游击队来代替革命正规军”的错误观点上。决议分析了“这些右倾和机会主义偏向的蔓延，是敌视希腊民族解放斗争的党外影响及帝国主义与战争阵营施用思想压力的结果”。决议批评了德国占领期间党领导远离列宁——斯大林主义的右倾路线，批评了政治局雅典分局被侵入的机会主义影响，从而“对保皇法西斯恐怖采取了妥协态度”。决议清扫了“恐美病”，有信心地指明：虽然美国在公开干涉，美军在参加作战，但是如果所有的共产党员都很好地完成任务，保皇法西斯和美英两国是可能被打败的。决议规定了许多新政策：“不许发生有意的反人民行为”，“不容许任意破坏攻克的市镇和没收小商人和手艺匠的财产”，“应在保皇法西斯军内部形成民主小组”，“粉碎排外的狭隘民族主义”。全会同时选出了以希共总书记萨查利阿第斯为首的新的政治局；并宣布希腊民主军统帅马科斯将军和另一位政治局委员，均因身患重病，而解除职务。
    美国反动政府公开拒绝斯大林关于商谈和平公约的建议以后，正加紧进行其危害世界和平和妄想统治世界的侵略计划——“北大西洋联盟”。一方面，美国政府在八日已开始和参加“联盟”的英法加荷比卢六国代表举行秘密会议；另一方面，美国正在驱策北欧的挪、丹、瑞（典）三国投入这个“联盟”。苏联政府为了坚决地反对帝国主义的侵略政策，已于五日第二次向挪威政府提出声明，建议缔结苏挪互不侵犯条约、揭破了挪威方面所喧嚷的“可能来自苏联的攻击”的借口。但是挪威政府目前热心的究竟是什么呢？事实不是更胜于狡辩吗？挪威外长兰基一面宣称“苏联的声明将得到更适当的研究”，一面在接到苏联声明以后的数小时，即匆匆忙忙动身去华盛顿，想尝一些“军事援助”之饵，而上这个把自己降为美国军事俘虏之钩。然而，北欧三国统治集团在参加这个侵略“联盟”时，它们不能不估计苏联对它们本身所存在的有利关系，也不能不考虑本国人民正在高声反动参加“联盟”的愤怒情绪。这就是美国首先在瑞典碰壁的地方。瑞典外长恩敦及总理埃兰德已在九日分别发表声明，“拒绝与大西洋公约的国家联合。”
    但是，尽管美国帝国主义还在装着“其势汹汹”的样子，而这只纸老虎的真面目却一天天地在暴露。美国经济危机的脚步声，是越来越近了。美国的农产品，一部分日用消费品的批发价格和股票价格，于四日起发生暴跌。谷类、肉食、羊毛、橡皮、棉花、肥皂等价格一概猛烈下跌，芝加哥的玉黍蜀每蒲式耳（约合三斗四升）于四月跌了五分五厘至七分七厘，七日又跌了二分至三分。纽约的棉花四日每包跌了一元二角五分。七日续跌一元二角至一元八角五分。美联社三十五种商品价格的指数，已跌到过去两年中的最低点，从去年二月以来到现在，已经跌了二十六点以上。纽约某些股票，四日每股跌了五元。七日又续跌。十日，美国股票交易已下跌到一年来的最低水平。美国农产品等价格自去年二月暴跌以来，始终波动不已。去年四月至七月，虽曾因采取了许多人为办法而一度回涨，但自八月起又连续回跌，至本月四日开始，这种下跌从缓慢变成了急速。这使得美国的所有企业家不能不“当作未来发展的线索，而密切地注视着”（美联社）。美国物价的再度猛跌，这是美国相对生产过剩的危机正在迅速发展的结果。美国帝国主义虽采用加紧对外扩张和军备竞赛的两个法宝，想替它的过剩商品寻求市场，但事实证明是没有多大用处的。马歇尔的七十亿对外“援助”计划，并没有挽救美国国外市场日益缩小的危机。即使根据美国官方的统计，一九四八年美国全年的输出总额，最多不能超过一百二十五亿美元，较一九四七年的一百五十三亿美元跌落达五分之一以上。如果算上高涨的物价，实际跌落的比例还要大得多。商品卖不出去，使美国堆在仓库里的存货，在去年十二月已到达五百四十四亿美元的高纪录，比前一年激增了二百亿元之巨。这种生产的相对过剩，便是这次物价猛跌的基本原因。生产的相对过剩已引起了生产缩减、企业倒闭的浪潮。据纽约时报透露：继棉毛纺织品、制鞋制袜、橡皮、玻璃、卡车、收音机、电汽冰箱各业减产以后，又有许多工业中心的五金制造工业也减产百分之五到十五。而且有些地区的这种减产，已达到危险的程度。同时，美国农业部已在敦促农民今年少种小麦、棉花和洋芋。生产普遍缩减的结果，使更大量的工人被抛到街头。今年一月份的失业人数，美国官方承认已猛增了七十万。美国经济危机的这座火山开始在震动了，这正是美帝国主义拚命加紧其侵略计划的根本原因之一。
    美英荷工贼们取消世界职工联盟的狂妄计划失败了。自从美英荷三国职工会反动代表在一月十七日宣布退出世界工联以后，世界工联执委会立即根据世界工联执行局的决定，于一月二十八日至二月一日在巴黎举行会议。出席这次会议的，有代表五大洲的六千二百万有组织的工人。代表着不列颠联邦内数百万职工利益的代表，也蔑视英国职工大会头子的分裂企图，远道赶来参加会议。会议坚决拒斥了英国职工大会常委会要求工联停止活动的建议，宣布执委会将继续执行其职务：动员世界职工为反对新战争和争取持久和平而斗争，为保卫工人权利和消灭法西斯残余而斗争。世界工联在抛开了分裂分子以后，顺利地决定六月在意大利召开世界工联第二次代表大会，五月在中国人民的新北平举行亚洲职工代表大会筹委会，并委托中国代表刘宁一草拟一个中华全国总工会和世界工联所属职工会共同行动的计划。会议还选出了意大利总工会总书记维特瑞奥为世界工联的新主席，来代替前主席英国职工大会总书记狄金，他已变成滚出世界工联大门的一个可怜的失败者了。美英荷职工会反动头子这种分裂和退出世界工联的叛卖行为，不仅为世界工联所唾弃，而且使这些国家内的先进工人发怒。英国全国矿工联合会苏格兰分会及英国其他许多地方工会，美国肉类包装工人工会等五个工会，荷兰工会联合会等，已发出了一片抗议声。
    最近国际间其他重要事件如下：
    （一）在缅甸革命力量继续高涨面前，缅甸反动统治分崩离析，内哄加剧。去年九月间原由英国所策动的克伦族“叛乱”，近已大大发展，促进了达钦努反动统治的危机。“叛军”已连续攻城克地，并正在仰光外围和政府军展开激战。
    （二）马来亚英国当局六日又无理逮捕华侨六百三十人。自一月十日颁布排华的“新紧急条例”以来，被捕的华侨已达一千七百余人。
    （三）意大利罢工运动风起云涌。米兰、都灵等地工人于十一日和九日分别举行总罢工，抗议厂主背弃承认工厂委员会的诺言。意北之其他许多地方的工人、全国银行职员及全国矿工等均纷纷举行罢工，提出增加工资等要求。罢工正继续扩大中。
    （四）匈牙利近破获一件在美国指使下的叛国阴谋案，主犯明曾蒂于八日被判处无期徒刑，美国副领事史塔西等，因间谍与私运叛国分子潜逃的罪状而被驱逐出境。　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　（新华社陕北十五日电）
