(Jilu Yu Telegram) In the newly recovered areas of Junan (newly established county, southern Junye) and Dongming counties, after publicizing policies and the situation, correcting policies, and other work, mass organizations have been restored and rectified according to the different situations of various villages. The Third and Fifth Districts of Henan Province experienced repeated enemy sweeps last spring, and a stable situation did not emerge until after the Suiji Campaign in July. During this period, many mass organizations fell into a state of disintegration, and some were destroyed by the enemy. Since the recovery of the First District of Dongming, district cadres, in conjunction with the autumn grain collection work, understood the situation in various villages. Based on the ideological concerns of village cadres, they held a symposium for village cadres and activists, first explaining the situation and various policies. Everyone's enthusiasm gradually increased, and they urgently demanded the restoration of their organizations. In the past ten days, according to incomplete statistics, out of 74 villages in the district, 45 farmers' associations have been restored, with more than 900 members; 21 women's associations have been restored, with more than 500 members; 38 new militiamen have been developed, and village governments have also begun to be rebuilt, ending the phenomenon of rotating positions. Although Junan County called on all districts to restore village organizations in September, at that time, the focus was still on wartime support work, and progress was not significant. In November, the county committee emphasized that all districts must combine central work, mobilize returnees, correct policies, and restore and rectify mass organizations. In the past month, each district has proceeded according to different situations, using different methods, and has achieved considerable results. Generally, it can be divided into three situations: The first is that village cadres can still play a role, but mass organizations have disintegrated. In this type of village, the practice is to widely call on and promote village cadres to restore the original mass organizations. As a result, 75 villages were restored in Nanlu District, 64 villages were restored in Zhangbiao District, and 35 villages were restored in Wenshang District. The second type is villages where the masses are highly enthusiastic, but village cadres are not active or individual cadres have defected. The practice is to launch the masses to conduct cadre review and strengthen village-level leadership during the mobilization of returnees and the correction of policies. For example, the director of the Women's Association of Liulinji in Zhangbiao District, Mao Erxi, mobilized militiamen to defect to the enemy during the enemy's "encirclement and suppression" in the spring, and led the supply of resources to the enemy, helping landlords steal and sell land. The Women's Association and the Farmers' Association both demanded her removal. At the plenary meeting of the Women's Association, opinions were raised to her, and she also made a self-criticism. Finally, she was removed from her post, and a new director of the Women's Association was elected. Another example is Gao Yubin and Gao Erzhou, members of the Farmers' Association of Qiandianzi in Zihe District. After they were liberated, they became passive and did not want to work; criticism and self-criticism were carried out at the Farmers' Association committee meeting, pointing out that after being liberated, they should not forget their roots, but should continue to work, overthrow the Kuomintang reactionaries, and establish a new China. As a result, both of them cleared their minds and actively carried out the work of mobilizing returnees. The third type of village is one that has been severely devastated by the enemy. Currently, feudal forces still occupy a dominant position, and village cadres are mostly controlled by them. The general public does not dare to engage in open activities. In this type of village, the practice is to first mobilize individual activists, connect basic masses, gradually expand their strength, and then conduct open activities when the time is ripe. For example, Zhao Dian Village only went through the Double Reduction and Anti-Traitor and Grievance Movement in the past. After the People's Liberation War began, it fell into enemy hands, and landlords and rich peasants carried out large-scale activities, reversing grain and funds, threatening and persecuting village cadres and activists. Although a land review was conducted in the autumn of 1947 and an organization was established, it was only a formality. Village cadres were perfunctory to us, so the masses still dare not move. Currently, the director of the Farmers' Association is still harboring armed agents, the head of the self-defense team is a member of the Three People's Principles Youth League, and the village chief is a gangster, helping landlords and wealthy people reverse grain and land, eating and drinking lavishly, and threatening the masses. Based on the above situation, it was decided to go deep into the village, first find the basic masses and the masses who were severely devastated by the enemy to carry out mobilization, from small to large, from secret connections to openly establishing organizations. The first time, seven people were found, and they were educated at the meeting. On the spot, they demanded the re-establishment of the Farmers' Association and formulated rules. After they continued to divide the work to connect, the membership expanded to 30 people at the third meeting, and then they turned to open activities to reverse the calculations against the landlords. All those who have carried out the work of restoring and rectifying mass organizations based on specific circumstances have achieved good results. On the contrary, the First District of Dongming did not have a sufficient understanding of the restoration and rectification of mass organizations, and simply used administrative power to complete the tasks of collection and other tasks. They were eager for quick results in their work, were careless, and pulled up those who showed temporary activity, resulting in a disconnection from the masses. For example, after Wei Laopian of Weizhuang became the village chief, he often stayed with the landlords and oppressed the masses. After the director of the Farmers' Association of Zhu Village took office, he even brought the grain-reversing elements that the masses most opposed into the Farmers' Association. These mistakes of not relying on the masses have been started to be corrected by the district committee.

### 分别各村不同情况　恢复整顿群众组织  巨南东明新收复区工作逐渐深入

　　分别各村不同情况
  　恢复整顿群众组织
    巨南东明新收复区工作逐渐深入
    【冀鲁豫电】巨南（新设县，巨野南部）、东明等县新收复区，经过宣传政策与形势，端正政策等工作，又根据各种不同村庄的不同情况，恢复与整顿了群众组织。河南三、五分区去春经敌人反复扫荡，一直至七月睢杞战役后才出现了稳定的局面。在这中间，许多群众组织陷于解体状态，有的已被敌人摧垮。东明一区自收复后，区干部结合秋征工作，了解了各村情况，并根据村干部的思想顾虑，召开了一个村干部积极分子座谈会，首先讲解了形势和各种政策，大家情绪逐渐提高，迫切要求恢复自己的组织。十几天来，据不完全统计：全区七十四个村，已恢复农会四十五个，会员九百多人；妇会二十一个，会员五百多名；新发展民兵三十八名，村政权也开始重建，停止了轮流担任的现象。巨南县虽在九月份即曾号召各区恢复村组织，但当时仍以战勤工作为主，进展不大。十一月份县委会强调提出：各区必须结合中心工作，动员归队，端正政策，进行恢复和整顿群众组织。一个月来，各区均根据不同情况，利用不同方式去进行，获得不少成绩。一般地可分为三种情况：第一种是一般村干尚能起作用，但群众组织已解体，在这种村的做法是广泛号召和推动村干部把原来的群众组织恢复起来，这样做的结果，南鲁区恢复了七十五个村，张表区恢复了六十四个村，汶上区恢复了卅五个村。第二种是群众情绪很高，村干部不积极或有个别干部叛变的村，做法是在动员归队和端正政策中，发动群众进行审干，加强村级领导。如张表区柳林集妇会主任，在春天敌人“清剿”时，活动民兵毛二希投敌，并领导资敌，帮助地主盗卖土地，妇会、农会都要求撤换她。在全体妇会上给她提了意见，她自己也作了检讨，最后撤了职，另选出新的妇会主任。再如子河区前店子农会委员高玉宾、高尔周，自己翻了身，便消极不想干了；在农会委员会上开展了批评与自我批评，指出翻了身不要忘本，仍要继续干下去，打倒国民党反动派，建立新中国，结果他两人都打通了思想，积极进行动员归队工作。再一种村是受敌摧残较严重，目前仍系封建势力占统治地位，村干多被他们掌握，一般群众不敢公开活动。在这类村里，做法是首先发动个别积极分子，串连基本群众，逐渐扩大力量，时机成熟，即进行公开活动。如赵店村过去仅经过双减和反奸诉苦运动，人民解放战争开始后即沦于敌手，地主、富农曾大肆活动，进行倒粮、倒款、威胁和残害村干、积极分子。一九四七年秋，虽进行了土地复查，建立起组织，但仅是形式，村干对我们是应付，因之群众至今仍不敢动。目前农会主任还窝藏武装特务，自卫队长是三青团员，村长是流氓，帮助地富倒粮、倒地，大吃大喝，威胁群众。根据以上情况，即确定深入下去，首先找到基本群众和受敌人摧残重的群众进行动员，由小到大，由秘密串连到公开的建立组织。第一次找到了七个人，在会议上进行了教育，当场他们就有重新成立农会的要求，并定出规约。经过他们继续分工串通。第三次开会就扩大了会员三十人，随即转入公开活动，向地主进行反倒算。凡是这样根据具体情况进行了恢复与整顿群众组织工作的，都收到了好的效果；相反，如东明一区对恢复整顿群众组织认识不够，单纯以行政力量完成征收等任务、工作时急于求成，粗枝大叶，看到某些一时表现积极的，便拉上台去，结果脱离了群众。如魏庄魏老偏自当了村长，便经常与地主在一起，压迫群众。朱庄农会主任上台后，连群众最反对的倒粮分子也拉进了农会。这些不依靠群众的错误，已由区委会开始纠正。
