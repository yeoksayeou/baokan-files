Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 4th. Indonesian guerrilla forces are growing stronger in battle. According to Agence France-Presse on January 26, the number of guerrillas resisting the Dutch has reached 300,000, and they are supported by armed youth organizations. In the past half-month, the guerrillas have reoccupied several areas of West Java that were withdrawn from the Republic under the Renville Agreement by the Hatta traitorous government. In East Java, the guerrillas have also occupied several previously evacuated positions. In the northern tip of Sumatra, the guerrillas have retained the former Republic's Atjeh region, inflicting heavy casualties on the Dutch aggressors. This region, where Indonesian progressive forces were dominant, was the only area not occupied after the Dutch army launched its "blitzkrieg" against Indonesia. According to Indonesian sources in London, guerrillas in Sumatra have killed more than 550 Dutch soldiers outside the eastern city. Guerrillas near Mojokerto, Java, recently killed and captured 200 Dutch soldiers (Agence France-Presse). In Surabaya naval port and near Malang city on Java Island, Dutch military and political personnel on patrol have been repeatedly ambushed (Associated Press).

The growing development of the Indonesian guerrilla war has forced the UN Security Council's "Committee of Good Offices for Indonesia" to admit in its January 24 report that the Indonesian "situation is extremely unstable," "the Dutch army dares not go deep, and serious disturbances are now occurring in some areas." Under these circumstances, Dutch officials have reversed their earlier talk of "reducing Dutch troops in Indonesia" that they released in early January at the time of the "ceasefire," and have openly announced that they will gradually increase troops to Indonesia this year. Dutch Commander-in-Chief in Indonesia, Spoor, recently announced a plan to continue operations against the guerrillas for three months (TASS).

The aggressive actions of Dutch imperialism continue to be opposed by its own people. On January 22, more than a thousand working people in The Hague held a mass meeting, at which parliamentarian Schoning and leaders of the Dutch Trade Union Federation gave speeches exposing the conspiracy of American, British, and Dutch imperialists to strangle the freedom of the Indonesian people. A public opinion poll published by a Dutch newspaper on January 29 admitted that 62 percent opposed the colonial war (in reality, the number is certainly higher).

　　印尼游击队日益壮大
  　抗荷武装发展至三十万人
    【新华社陕北四日电】印尼游击队在战斗中日益壮大。据法新社一月二十六日电，目前抗荷的游击队数达三十万人，并得到武装青年组织的支持。游击队于过去半月内，已重占西爪哇若干根据伦维尔协定被哈达卖国政府撤出的共和国地区。在东爪哇方面，游击队亦占领了若干前已撤出的阵地。在苏门答腊北端，游击队曾保住了前共和国的阿提杰地区，予荷兰侵略军以重大杀伤。该地区曾为印尼进步力量占优势的地区，系荷军对印尼发动“闪击”后唯一未被侵占的地区。据伦敦印尼人士披露：苏门答腊游击队在把东城外围已击毙荷军五百五十余名。爪哇茉莉芬城附近的游击队，最近亦毙俘荷军二百名（法新社）。在爪哇岛上的泗水军港及玛琅市附近，出巡的荷兰军政人员屡遭伏击（美联社）。
    印尼游击战争的日益发展，就连安理会印尼“调处”委员会在其一月二十四日的报告中，不得不承认印尼“局势极不稳定”，“荷军不敢深入，若干点现发生严重纷扰”。在这种情况下，荷兰官方一反其于一月上旬“停战”时所放出的“撤减印尼荷军”的空气，并公开宣布将于今年内陆续向印尼增兵。印尼荷军总司令斯波尔并于最近宣布对游击队继续作战三个月的计划（塔斯社）。
    荷兰帝国主义的侵略行动，继续受到本国人民的反对。一月二十二日，海牙劳动人民千人以上曾举行群众大会，议员肖宁伯及荷兰工会联合会领袖等曾发表演说，揭露美英荷帝国主义者绞杀印尼人民自由的阴谋。荷兰报纸于一月二十九日公布的民意测验的结果，承认反对殖民战争的达百分之六十二（实际上当然不止此数）。
