　　Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 11th. Another dispatch from Beiping by Associated Press reporter Mu Sa on the 7th is also helpful for the people of Beiping to recognize the face of this reporter. The full text of the dispatch is as follows:
    "(Associated Press, Beiping, February 7th) (Shanghai branch dispatched at 8:45 to 9:15 on the 8th) Mu Sa reports: Beiping students, who are making every effort to please the new regime, have their own ideas about communism. Today, a group of students stopped a Chinese girl wearing a fur coat on a street. One student pointed to her coat and asked, 'What kind of fur is this?' She replied, 'Fox fur.' Another student asked, 'How many legs does a fox have?' She said, 'Four.' One of her interrogators ordered, 'Then crawl like a fox.' The girl began to cry. Several older people in the crowd mediated for the girl. They begged the students not to damage her personality. The students agreed, but before leaving, one student said one last sentence. He warned, 'Now that we have a new China, no one is allowed to wear fox fur.'"
    After reading such a "report," one cannot help but ask: When the people of Beiping pointed out that Mu Sa was a slanderer, were they wrong? Can the American people hope to understand the new China from the pen of such a slanderer?

　　美帝记者对北平人民又一诽谤
    【新华社陕北十一日电】美联社记者穆萨七日发出的另一则关于北平的电讯，对于北平人民认识这位记者的面目也是有帮助的。该电讯全文如下：
    “（美联社北平七日电）（上海分社八日八时三刻到九时一刻发）穆萨报导：正在尽一切努力图食得新政权欢心的北平学生们，对共产主义有自己的观念。今天，一群学生在一条大街上拦住了一位穿着皮大衣的中国女郎，一位学生指着她的大衣问道：‘这是什么皮子？’她回答道：‘狐皮。’另一个学生问：‘狐狸有几条腿？’她说：‘四条。’她的一位讯问者下令道：‘那么，和狐狸一样爬。’女郎就开始哭了。人群中若干年长的人代这位女郎从中调停。他们乞求学生们不要损害她的人格。学生们同意了，但在走开以前，一位学生说了最后一句话。他警告说：‘现在我们有了新中国，不准任何人穿狐皮。’”
    人们看了这样的“报导”，不能不问：当北平的人民指出穆萨是一个诽谤者时，他们难道是说错了吗？美国人民难道能希望从这样的诽谤者的笔下来认识新中国吗？
