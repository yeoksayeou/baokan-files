　　Financial Times of London Points Out
　　US Post-War Economy Heading for Huge Decline
　　Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 21st: TASS London, 14th: An editorial in the Financial Times here points out: The sudden drop in US prices, the continuous increase in unemployment, and the weakness of New York stock trading, have led to a widespread belief here that the post-war prosperity of the United States has passed its peak and is now heading for a huge decline in production, employment and national income. Commenting on the statement by American leaders that "there is currently no reason to be alarmed or panicked," the newspaper pointed out: "There is no evidence that their reassuring words can convince the majority of businessmen."
