　　February 7th Brief News
　　Railway Workers in Central Shanxi Propose:
　　Expedite the restoration of transportation, and liberate all of Shanxi by capturing Taiyuan.
　　[Reported by this newspaper] Various locations in North China held grand rallies to commemorate the 26th anniversary of the "February 7th" strike. Workers from trade unions in various places commemorated this festival with joyful and uplifting spirits after liberation. Railway and factory workers in central Shanxi enthusiastically commemorated "February 7th," vowing to actively restore transportation, expedite production, support the front lines, and ultimately eliminate the reactionaries. The Yuci Section Affairs Committee of the Zhengtai Railway and the Central Shanxi Management Committee of the Datong-Puzhou Railway jointly convened a "February 7th" commemoration meeting. After reporting on the historical struggle of the "February 7th" strike, they explained that today the working class in the liberated areas has become the master of state-owned enterprises, and should work hard in production and actively support the People's Liberation War to lay a solid foundation for an independent, prosperous, and democratic New China. Fang Zhongqi, a worker representative from the Yuci Engineering Section of the Zhengtai Railway, said: "Today, as we commemorate 'February 7th,' our railway workers should take practical action to ensure the completion of the task of supporting the front lines, capture the city of Taiyuan as soon as possible, eliminate Yan Xishan, and liberate all of Shanxi." Workers from the Yuci Jinhua Textile Factory unanimously expressed their intention to respond to Chairman Mao's call of "increase production by an inch" by improving the quality and quantity of production, saving raw materials, and reducing costs. At the group discussions of the Yuci private factory workers on the "February 7th" commemoration day, they unanimously proposed improving labor-management relations, demanding attention to workers' welfare, and at the same time, workers should cooperate with the factory to complete and exceed the production plan as a gift to commemorate "February 7th."
　　Tangshan Workers Say:
　　We have become masters of the new society, and we must have a new attitude towards labor.
　　Tangshan City, with nearly 100,000 workers, held grand commemoration meetings and factory worker forums on that day to commemorate the 26th anniversary of "February 7th." In their speeches, worker representatives unanimously demanded that the working class strengthen their unity and, under the wise leadership of Chairman Mao, inherit the glorious traditions of revolutionary martyrs and fight to the end for the sacred cause of the working class. The conference also praised the heroic deeds of the Dongsan Mine workers who, in the past, fought for the interests of their class, unafraid of the enemy's torture and massacre, and the glorious historical traces of Communist Party members Xie Zhenguo, Wang Jiayi, He Xifeng and other comrades who led the struggle. It was further pointed out that we workers used to live inhuman lives under the rule, oppression, and exploitation of imperialism and feudal forces. Today, we have become the masters of the new society and the leading class of the New Democratic society. Therefore, it is called on everyone to develop production, support the Liberation War, and completely eliminate the reactionaries with a new attitude of labor.
　　Workers in Central Hebei Express:
　　While we are so happy and free, let us not forget the workers under Kuomintang rule.
　　Three thousand employees from all sectors in Baoding City studied the document "'February 7th' is what kind of day" on the morning of the "February 7th" commemoration. Extensive publicity was carried out throughout the city. At the meeting, railway worker Gao Yushui, who personally participated in the "February 7th" struggle, reported on the tragic case he witnessed of reactionary warlords directing military police to shoot and kill railway workers in Changxindian. He exposed the various crimes of the Kuomintang reactionaries in exploiting and persecuting workers. More than a thousand employees of the Central Hebei Logistics Clothing Bureau also held a commemoration meeting at their residence. The director of the bureau's trade union reported on the achievements of the three-month spring clothing production competition last winter, and called on all employees to continue their efforts to improve technology, increase product quantity and quality, and strengthen unity; old workers should patiently help new workers, and new workers should strive to learn from old workers. Worker Guo Tiema happily said: "Now that we can be so free and happy, let us not forget the suffering worker comrades who are still under the rule of the Kuomintang reactionaries. We must work hard to produce, support the front lines, and liberate them."
