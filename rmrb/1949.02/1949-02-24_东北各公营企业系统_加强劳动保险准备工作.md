Xinhua News Agency, Shenyang, February 22nd: The Northeast's major public enterprise systems are continuing to prepare for the implementation of labor insurance. In addition to the Northeast Railway System and some mining areas reported in the agency's telegram on the 12th, the labor insurance committee of the military industry system has also been established, led by the Minister of the Military Industry Department himself, and in close coordination with the department's relevant departments. For example, the Director of the Management Department is responsible for paying labor insurance funds and establishing a labor insurance accounting system, and the Director of the Health Department is responsible for all medical and health matters related to labor insurance. Since the trade union federations have not yet been established in the mining and textile systems, temporary labor insurance committees have been established. Some specific preparations have begun in mines such as Hegang and Fushun, such as establishing sanatoriums to accommodate disabled or sick workers and arranging for those who can perform light labor to engage in production. The Northeast Postal and Telecommunications Administration has established a labor insurance committee and has already paid more than 98 million yuan in labor insurance funds for January.
　　In addition, the Labor Bureau of the Northeast Administrative Committee convened an enlarged meeting from the 1st to the 5th of this month to discuss matters related to the implementation of labor insurance, discussed many issues encountered by various enterprises in preparing for the implementation of labor insurance, and made important supplements and revisions to the "Draft Implementation Rules of the Labor Insurance Regulations." For example, regarding the scope of implementation of labor insurance, it is stipulated that permanent and fixed employees in the seven major public enterprise systems (i.e., railway, mining, textile, electrical, postal and telecommunications, military industry, and military supplies), regardless of nationality or ethnicity, shall enjoy the rights stipulated in these regulations. Other temporary workers (such as the cotton padding workers of the Military Supplies Department) or affiliated small factories (such as public-private cooperative processing industries, private processing factories, and small factories organized by workers' families to produce) shall not be subject to these regulations for the time being. Regarding the labor insurance fund, some units suggested that 3% of the total wage bill was not enough. After research at the meeting, it was decided that if each unit does not have enough, the labor insurance committee of the vocational system shall make unified adjustments, and if it is still not enough, the Northeast Federation of Trade Unions shall make adjustments. The standard of labor insurance regulations must not be lowered due to the misuse of insurance funds by some units. At the same time, each unit should not arbitrarily raise the standard of drawing 3% of the total wage bill. Other issues regarding the calculation of general seniority and factory seniority, regulations on old-age subsidies or disability pensions due to work-related injuries, care for workers' families, and women workers' maternity issues have all been clearly stipulated.

　　东北各公营企业系统
  　加强劳动保险准备工作
    【新华社沈阳二十二日电】东北各大公营企业系统现正继续进行实施劳动保险的准备工作。除本社十二日电讯报导的东北铁路系统及部分矿区外，军事工业系统的劳动保险委员会亦已建立，由军事工业部部长亲自领导，并与该部各有关部门密切配合，如由经理处长负责缴纳劳动保险基金及建立劳动保险会计制度，卫生处长则负责劳动保险中一切医药卫生事项。矿山、纺织两系统因尚未成立职工总会，已建立了临时劳动保险委员会。鹤岗、抚顺等矿山已开始进行了一些具体准备工作，如设立休养院，收容残废或有病的职工，安插能作轻劳动者进行生产等。东北邮电管理总局已组成劳动保险委员会，并已缴出一月份劳动保险基金九千八百余万元。
    又东北行政委员会劳动总局于本月一日至五日召集有关实施劳动保险事宜，扩大会议，讨论了各企业单位在准备实施劳动保险中的所遇到的许多问题，并对“劳动保险条例实施细则草案”作了重要的补充和修改。如关于劳动保险的实施范围，规定为七大公营企业系统（即铁路、矿山、纺织、电气、邮电、军工、军需）中保持长期性之固定职工，不分国籍、民族均享受此条例所规定的权利。其他临时工（如军需部之絮行工人）或附属之小工厂（如公私合作性的加工业，加工的私人工厂及组织职工家属生产的小工厂等）则暂不适用此条例。关于劳动保险基金，有的单位提出按工资总额百分之三不够使用，经过会上研究，决定各单位不够时由该职业系统劳动保险委员会统一调剂，再不够时由东北职工总会调剂，决不能因某些单位挪动保险基金不够使用而降低劳动保险条例的标准。同时各单位也不应将抽工资总额百分之三的标准随意提高。其他关于一般工龄和厂龄的计算，养老补助金或因公残废抚恤金的规定，职工家属的照顾，女工生育等问题都作了明确规定。
