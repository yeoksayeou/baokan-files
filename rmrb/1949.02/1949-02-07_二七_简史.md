Twenty-six years ago, the Chinese working class, primarily the workers of the Ping-Han Railway, held an unprecedented and heroic political strike in history—the "February 7th" Great Strike. At that time, the political situation in China was roughly as follows: the entire North China was generally under the rule of the so-called "Zhili Clique" (Zhili refers to Zhili, now Hebei) warlords headed by Cao Kun and Wu Peifu. Their power had reached the middle reaches of the Yangtze River provinces, making them the largest and most powerful warlord group at the time, and the holders of the nominal central government. In the lower reaches of the Yangtze River provinces, the "Anhui Clique" (headed by warlords from Anhui) warlord group, led by Duan Qirui, ruled alongside the Zhili Clique. The southwestern provinces were divided and ruled by other large and small warlords dependent on the "Zhili" and "Anhui" cliques. Sun Yat-sen was active in Guangdong and Guangxi, hoping to use the power of the local warlords as a basis to confront the northern warlords. The northeast outside the pass was in the hands of the "Fengtian Clique" (Fengtian refers to Fengtian, now Liaoning) warlords such as Zhang Zuolin. All these warlords were representatives of the large landlords and big bourgeoisie of different regions of China and running dogs of one or several imperialist countries. They were representatives of China's semi-colonial and semi-feudal rule and the fierce enemies of the Chinese people. Among these warlord groups at the time, the Zhili Clique warlord Wu Peifu had the greatest military strength. They occupied several of China's most important provinces such as Hebei, Henan, Hubei, and other places, so Wu Peifu became an even more vicious group in the anti-revolutionary camp at the time. The above is the situation on the anti-revolutionary side. On the revolutionary side, the Chinese working class party—the Chinese Communist Party—which led the Chinese people in carrying out the anti-imperialist and anti-feudal revolution, had been established a year and a half before the "February 7th" struggle, in July 1921. Since its inception, the CCP has paid close attention to the workers' movement. The CCP established the China Labor Union Secretariat in Beijing as an organ to lead the national workers' movement, and the work of the Beijing-Hankou Railway workers was one of their goals. In 1922, workers' struggles spread to almost all important enterprises and mines across the country, among which the most famous were the 56-day Hong Kong Seamen's Strike in January and the 20-day Kailuan Five Mines Strike in October. In the same year, the First National Labor Congress was held in Guangzhou on May Day. During this period, various trade unions across the country were established one after another. Through these struggles, under the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party, the Chinese working class quickly united its ranks, not only fighting for its own economic interests, but also becoming the vanguard and leader of the Chinese people's anti-imperialist and anti-feudal revolution.

    The "February 7th" struggle took place on this basis. On February 1, 1923, the General Labor Union of the Beijing-Hankou Railway was established in Zhengzhou, attended by hundreds of representatives from the Beijing-Hankou Railway and guests from trade unions across the country. The warlord Wu Peifu sent troops to surround the venue on the same day, arrested the representatives and prohibited the meeting from being held. However, the representatives and guests heroically held the opening ceremony amidst the army's encirclement. After the meeting, the military police destroyed the venue, occupied the site of the General Labor Union, and heavily surrounded the residences of the representatives and guests, implementing armed suppression. On the evening of the same day, the General Labor Union decided to launch a general strike along the entire railway starting at noon on the 4th. During the strike, all actions would be under the command of the General Labor Union, and the General Labor Union of the Beijing-Hankou Railway would be moved to Jiang'an in Hankou to handle affairs. The resolution to launch the strike stated: "We fight for freedom, we fight for human rights, and we will never retreat!" The strike was implemented along the entire railway after noon on the 4th. On the 5th, Wu Peifu's henchman, the Hubei Governor Xiao Yaonan, sent people to Jiang'an, forcing the workers to hand over the union leaders and forcing them to resume work, but the workers resolutely refused. Several members of the workers' picket team were also arrested. On the 6th, more than 10,000 trade union members and railway workers in Wuhan held a meeting to protest and held a demonstration, directly entering the British concession. During the same period, similar incidents occurred at major stations along the Beijing-Hankou Railway, and the workers resolutely refused to yield. On the afternoon of the 7th, after deliberations and instructions from the British imperialist consul in Hankou, Xiao Yaonan's troops surrounded the General Labor Union and began a bloody massacre, killing more than 30 people and wounding more than 200 people. Comrade Lin Xiangqian, chairman of the Jiang'an branch and member of the Chinese Communist Party, and dozens of others were arrested and tied to electric poles by executioners, forcing him to order the resumption of work. The cruel warlord representative ordered the executioner to cut Comrade Lin once first, asking him "Will you resume work?" Lin shouted "No!" After several cuts, Lin's answer was always: "Resuming work requires the order of the General Labor Union. My head can be cut off, but work will not resume!" Finally, he loudly proclaimed: "We cannot let a good China be ruined in the hands of you bastard warlords!" The warlord representative immediately ordered Lin to be beheaded and displayed to the public. The most outstanding and heroic representative of the Chinese working class sacrificed gloriously and generously in this way. On the same day, a similar tragedy occurred in Changxindian, the northern section of the Beijing-Hankou Railway, with four deaths, more than 30 serious injuries, and countless minor injuries. Similar tragedies also occurred at other stations. On February 15th, Shi Yang, a CCP member who actively participated in the strike, was brutally murdered in Wuchang. After the tragedy, sympathetic strikes occurred on the Daoqing Railway, Zhengtai Railway, Tianjin-Pukou Railway, Yuehan Railway, Beijing-Fengtian Railway, and Beijing-Suiyuan Railway. The citizens and students of Beijing held protest demonstrations and a memorial service attended by more than 5,000 people. This is the simple course of the "February 7th" struggle.

    The goals of the "February 7th" martyrs and heroes were to fight for freedom, fight for democracy, fight for human rights, and oppose imperialism and its running dogs, the Chinese warlords. Today, under the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party, these goals have been fully achieved in the Chinese Liberated Areas. Not only that, but the anti-imperialist, anti-feudal, and anti-bureaucratic capitalist New Democratic Revolution, which opposes the Kuomintang reaction government that is a hundred times more vicious than Wu Peifu, will also achieve victory throughout the country. At this critical juncture of the final victory of the revolution, the leading class of the new Chinese regime—the Chinese working class—should inherit the heroic spirit of the martyrs and heroes in the "February 7th" struggle, intensify the construction of the new China, support the front lines, and strive to carry the revolution through to the end!
    
    Eternal glory to the martyrs who died in the "February 7th" incident! (Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 5th)

　　“二七”简史
    距今二十六周年以前，以平汉铁路工人为主体，中国工人阶级举行了历史上空前英勇的一次政治大罢工——“二七”大罢工。当时中国的政治情况，简单说来是这样：整个的华北大体是在以曹锟、吴佩孚为首的所谓“直系”（直指直隶，即今河北）军阀的统治之下，他们的势力已达到长江中游省份，是当时最大最有势力的一个军阀集团，并且是名义上的中央政权的掌握者。在长江的下游省份，是直系与另一个以段祺瑞为首的“皖系”（安微籍军阀为首）军阀集团统治者。西南各省为另外一些依靠于“直”“皖”之间的大小军阀割据称雄。孙中山当时在两广活动，希望以当地军阀的力量为基础来和北方的军阀对抗。关外的东北则在“奉系”（奉指奉天，即今辽宁）军阀张作霖等之手。而所有这些军阀们都是中国不同地区大地主大资产阶级的代表和一个或几个帝国主义国家的走狗，他们是中国的半殖民地半封建统治的代表者，是中国人民的凶恶敌人。在当时这些军阀集团中，以直系军阀的吴佩孚所有的军事实力最大，他们据有中国最冲要的几省如河北、河南、湖北以及其他等地，所以吴佩孚又成为当时反革命集团中更为凶恶的一个集团。以上是反革命阵营方面的情形。在革命方面，则在“二七”斗争的一年半以前，即一九二一年七月，已经成立了领导中国人民进行反帝反封建革命的中国工人阶级的政党——中国共产党。中共自产生之日起，即十分注意工人运动。中共在北京成立了中国劳动组合书记部，作为领导全国工人运动的机关，京汉铁路的工人工作，便是他们努力的目标之一。一九二二年，工人的斗争遍及于几乎全国一切重要的企业矿山，其中最著名的几次便是当年一月历时五十六天的香港海员大罢工，十月发生历时二十余天的开滦五矿大罢工。同年的五一节在广州召开了第一次全国劳动大会，在此时期，全国各种工会纷纷成立。经过这些斗争，中国工人阶级在中国共产党的领导之下，迅速团结了自己的队伍，不但为自己的经济利益而斗争，并且成了中国人民反帝反封建革命的先锋队和领导者。
    “二七”的斗争，便是在这样的基础上发生的。一九二三年二月一日，京汉铁路总工会在郑州成立，到京汉路代表及全国各地工会来宾数百人。军阀吴佩孚是日派兵包围会场拘捕代表不准开会，但各代表及来宾仍在军队包围中英勇的举行了开幕式，会后军警即捣毁会场，占领总工会会址，重兵包围代表及来宾住所，实行武装镇压。是日晚，总工会决定全路于四日正午起总同盟罢工，在罢工期内，一切行动听总工会指挥，并将京汉铁路总工会移往汉口的江岸办事。在这个发动罢工的决议中说：“我们为争自由而战，为争人权而战，决无退后！”罢工于四日正午后全路实行。五日吴佩孚爪牙湖北督军萧耀南派人到江岸，强迫工人交出工会领袖，并强迫开工，均经工人坚决拒绝，又捕去工人纠察团数名。六日，武汉各工会及铁路工人万余开会抗议，并举行示威，直入英租界。同期，京汉路各大站均发生类似事件，工人坚决不屈。七日下午，萧耀南的军队在汉口英帝国主义领事计议指示之后即包围总工会开始血腥屠杀，击死卅余人，击伤二百余人，江岸分会委员长中国共产党员林祥谦同志及其他数十人被捕，被刽子手缚于电杆上，迫令要他下令复工，残酷的军阀代表，令刽子手将林同志先砍一刀，问其“上不上工？”林抗声“不上！”如是连砍数刀，林的回答终是：“上工要总工会的命令，我的头可断，工是不上的！”最后大声称：“不能让一个好好的中国，断送在你们这般混帐王八蛋的军阀手里！”军阀代表立即下令将林砍首示众。中国工人阶级最优秀最英勇的代表就这样光荣慷慨的牺牲了。同日，京汉路北段的长辛店，也发生类似惨案，死四人，重伤三十余人，轻伤无数，其他车站也有惨案发生。二月十五日，积极参与罢工的中共党员施洋律等，又被惨杀于武昌。惨案发生后，道清路、正太路、津浦路、粤汉路、京奉路、京绥路等均发生同情罢工。北京的市民、学生更举行抗议示威及五千多人的追悼大会。这就是“二七”斗争的简单经过。
    “二七”的先烈们和英雄们斗争的目标，是争取自由，争取民主，争取人权，反对帝国主义及其走狗中国军阀。今天在中国共产党的领导之下，这些目标在中国解放区内已经完全达到了。不仅如此，反对比吴佩孚更加凶恶千百倍的国民党反动政府，反帝、反封建、反官僚资本的新民主主义革命，也将在全国范围内取得胜利了，在此革命最后胜利的关头，新中国政权的领导阶级——中国工人阶级应当继承“二七”斗争中的烈士们和英雄们的英勇精神，加紧建设新中国，支援前线，为将革命进行到底而奋斗！
