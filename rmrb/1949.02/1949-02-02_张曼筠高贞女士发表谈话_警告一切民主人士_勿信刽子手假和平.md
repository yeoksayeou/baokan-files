Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, January 30th: Ms. Zhang Manjun and Ms. Gao Zhen, the widows of Li Gongpu and Wen Yiduo, two martyrs and members of the Central Committee of the China Democratic League who were brutally murdered by Chiang Kai-shek's secret agents in Kunming in July 1946, recently jointly issued a written statement on the current situation, warning all democrats to be especially vigilant about the false peace offered by the Kuomintang reactionaries. Otherwise, they would be letting down countless revolutionary martyrs who sacrificed their lives for the people's revolution. The full text of the statement is as follows:

　　Recently, the People's Liberation Army has won unprecedented great victories, eliminating the largest part of the main force of the Chiang army. The Nanjing reactionary group has no choice but to consider peace talks and a truce. Chiang Kai-shek himself does not dare to show his face and temporarily hides in Fenghua, asking the second war criminal, Li Zongren, to come forward to seek peace. We believe that we must remind everyone to think carefully, are Chiang Kai-shek and Li Zongren, these war criminals, seeking peace sincerely? Can they be trusted? Everyone should not forget why Mr. Li Gongpu, Mr. Wen Yiduo, and later Mr. Du Binqing and others were killed by Chiang Kai-shek's secret agents two and a half years ago? It was because they wanted peace, democracy, and true peace and democracy. Two and a half years later, the people who killed them are now "begging" for peace because they have been defeated, and are even shouting about democracy. Can this kind of peace and democracy shouted from the mouths of executioners be trusted? It absolutely cannot be trusted. Unless the Nanjing Kuomintang reactionary government truly, sincerely, and completely fulfills all eight conditions put forward by Chairman Mao Zedong of the Chinese Communist Party, first by detaining the chief war criminals such as Chiang Kai-shek, can it be said that there is true peace. Otherwise, if they are just pretending to be dead, shouting empty words about peace, and deliberately bargaining over the eight conditions in order to prolong the time and restore their combat power, then they are definitely not sincerely seeking peace, but rather false peace. False peace is for the sake of taking a breath, preserving the remaining forces of the reactionary group, so that they can find an opportunity in the future to oppress and slaughter the Chinese people again. The Chinese people must not be fooled, and all those who are willing to join the democratic camp must not be fooled even more. Chiang Kai-shek's bandit gang has not clamored for peace for the first time. Three years ago, during the Old Political Consultative Conference period, Chiang Kai-shek also talked about peace, but while clamoring for peace, he advanced into the Northeast, preparing for a large-scale civil war to slaughter the people. After the collapse of the Old Political Consultative Conference, Chiang Kai-shek still said he wanted peace, but while clamoring for peace, he launched a large-scale civil war, attacking everywhere, and killed Mr. Li, Mr. Wen, Mr. Du, and many other democratic fighters. Today, if we hear the bloodthirsty war criminals and executioners open their bloody mouths and say a word of peace, and think that the world will be peaceful from now on, and that the blood debts of thousands upon thousands of people in the past can be ignored, all the painful experiences and lessons can be thrown behind our heads, and even allow the reactionary war criminals to go scot-free, or even preserve some of their power and positions, so that they can make a comeback in the future and continue to slaughter the people, then we will be letting down the Chinese people, and even more letting down the thousands upon thousands of martyrs who shed their blood for true peace and democracy. The martyrs will not rest in peace. The price of blood that the Chinese people have paid for true peace, democracy, unity, and solidarity is too great and too expensive. Now that the revolution is about to achieve its final victory and the people of the whole country are about to stand up, we must recognize who are our enemies and who are our friends, settle this blood debt for the people, and carry the revolution through to the end.

　　张曼筠高贞女士发表谈话
  　警告一切民主人士
    勿信刽子手假和平
    【新华社陕北三十日电】一九四六年七月在昆明遭蒋介石特务惨杀的中国民主同盟中央委员李公朴闻一多二烈士的夫人张曼筠女士和高贞女士，顷就最近时局联名发表书面谈话，警告一切民主人士，对于国民党反动派提出的虚伪和平，要特别警惕，不然，就会对不起无数为人民革命流血牺牲的先烈。谈话全文如下：
    最近解放军空前大胜利，消灭了蒋军最大部分的主力。南京反动集团只好作和平停战的打算。蒋介石自己不敢露脸，暂时躲到奉化去，，叫第二名战犯李宗仁出面求和。我们认为必须提醒大家，细心想一想，蒋介石李宗仁这些战犯们的求和是出于真心真意吗？是可以相信的吗？大家总不应当忘记，两年半前，李公朴先生闻一多先生和后来的杜斌丞先生等为什么被蒋介石特务杀死？就因为他们要和平，要民主，要真正的和平民主。在两年半以后，杀死他们的人因为打了败仗，也在“哀求”和平了，甚至也嚷起民主来了。这种从刽子手口中喊出来的和平民主，可以相信吗？是万万相信不得的。除非南京国民党反动政府，真正按照中共毛泽东主席提出的八项条件，诚心诚意不折不扣地全部做到，首先是将蒋介石等首要战犯扣留，才能说是有了真正的和平。要不然，只是装假死，空口嚷和平，故意对八项条件讨价还价，以便拉长时间，恢复战力，那决不是真心要和平，而是假和平。假和平就是为的要喘一口气，要保存反动集团的残存势力，以便于日后找到机会，再来压迫屠杀中国人民。中国人民一定不可上当，一切愿意参加民主阵营的人们更其不可上当。蒋介石匪帮叫嚣和平，并不是第一次。三年前，旧政协时期，蒋介石也是口口声声要和平，但一面叫嚣和平，一面却进兵东北，准备大规模屠杀人民的内战。这是旧政协破裂之后，蒋介石也还是说要和平，但一面叫嚣和平，一面却大打内战，到处进攻，并且把李先生、闻先生、杜先生和其他许多民主战士杀害了。到了今天，要是我们一听到杀人不眨眼的战犯刽子手们张开血口叫一声和平，就以为从此天下太平，而过去千千万万人的血债都可以不算，一切惨痛的经验教训，都可以丢在脑后，甚至还可以让反动派战犯逍遥法外，甚至保存一部分权位，以便于日后卷土重来，继续屠杀人民，这就对不起中国人民，更对不起千万万为真正和平民主流血牺牲的先烈，先烈们就要死不瞑目。中国人民为了真正的和平民主统一团结而付出的鲜血代价是太巨大了，太昂贵了。现在革命快要得到最后胜利，全国人民就要翻身，我们必须认清敌友，为人民算清这笔血帐，使革命贯彻到底。
