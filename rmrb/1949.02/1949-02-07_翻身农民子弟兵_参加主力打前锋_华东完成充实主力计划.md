  　East China Completes Plan to Strengthen Main Force
    [Xinhua News Agency, East China, 5th] The first phase of the East China Reserve Corps' plan to strengthen the main force has been completed as scheduled. Soldiers from a certain unit's children's corps joined the main force for combat at the end of January. The majority of this upgraded children's corps are emancipated peasants who have experienced mass movements such as rent reduction, interest rate reduction, and land reform. Communist Party members account for 28% of the total number of people in a certain regiment, and experienced veterans account for four-fifths. During the training process in the rear, each team universally established mutual aid groups of three to five people, voluntarily formed by new and old soldiers, and formulated individual plans to avenge, kill enemies, and perform meritorious service. On the way to the front lines, they encountered many returning laborers from the front lines, carrying large flags and awards, and everyone's spirits were high. After the unit entered the new district, they saw the tragic situation of the people being ravaged by the Kuomintang bandit army, which further aroused their emotions to avenge the people, and they practiced martial arts one after another, preparing to avenge the people. The entire squad of the third platoon of the twelfth company of a certain regiment even wrote to their superiors, guaranteeing: "Obey orders, follow commands, fear no hardship, fear no long distances, and fear no fighting."

  　华东完成充实主力计划
    【新华社华东五日电】华东后备兵团第一期充实主力计划如期完成，某部子弟兵团健儿已于一月底先后参加主力作战。这批升级的子弟兵团，大部是经过减租减息、土地改革等群众运动的翻身农民。某团中共产党员占全人数百分之二十八，有实战经验的战士占五分之四。各团队在后方训练过程中，普遍地建立了新老战士自愿结合的三人至五人的互助组，并订定了各人复仇杀敌立功计划。在开赴前线途中，遇到许多从前线荣归的民工，擎着大旗奖牌，大家情绪奋昂。该部进驻新区后，看到人民受国民党匪军蹂躏的凄惨情景，更激起了为人民复仇情绪，纷纷练武，准备为老百姓报仇。某团十二连三班全体战士更上书上级首长，保证：“服从命令，听从指挥，不怕艰苦，不怕路远，不怕打仗。”
