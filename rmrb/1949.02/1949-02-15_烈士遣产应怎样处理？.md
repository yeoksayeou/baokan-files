Inquiry and Reply

To the Editor:
    I have a question that I don't understand, please provide an answer:
    (1) In our village, the family of martyr Jiang Xueyou, who joined the army in 1943. His wife divorced him before he joined the army. He died in Bo'ai County in 1947. His family has 4.2 mu of land, 7 rooms, 1 cow, and 1 sheep. This spring, during the land redistribution, the work team compensated these items to wrongly classified middle peasants. Cadres and the masses universally reflect: The Land Law Outline states that the families of martyrs should also receive a share, why didn't our village give him a share, but also distributed all of his ancestral property? He has two brothers, can they take care of it for him?
    (2) Yang Kaoze is a cadre's family member, who joined the army in 1941, and was later transferred to the Third Military Subdistrict. He died of illness in Cixian County, Second Military Subdistrict, in 1947. His family has 5.6 mu of land, 3 cave dwellings, 2 cows, 3 sheep, and more than ten dan of grain. During the land reform, all of his family's property was also distributed. Is this appropriate? Please provide an answer.

Comrades Jiang Qunyou, Zhao Sanbao, Zhao Kaizheng, Zhang Keqin:
    According to your report, martyr Jiang Xueyou's wife has remarried and has no children. His remaining land, houses, and belongings can be used by his cohabiting relatives and brothers, with reference to the opinions of the masses. It is best to first set aside a portion to build a tomb and erect a monument for the martyr as a memorial. The property of martyrs should not be used to compensate wrongly classified middle peasants during rectification. If this issue has already been handled, a proper solution should be devised according to the specific circumstances of your village.
    Regarding the inheritance of Yang Kaoze, since he has no immediate family members and no cohabiting brothers, a tomb and monument should first be built for the martyr, and the remaining property can be appropriately handled by the Farmers' Association and the village government.

### 烈士遣产应怎样处理？

专栏：询问与答复

　　烈士遣产应怎样处理？编辑同志：
    我有一问题不明白请给解答一下：
    （一）我村烈属蒋雪有是在一九四三年参军的，他媳妇在参军前离了婚。一九四七年他在博爱县牺牲。家有土地四亩二分，房屋七间，牛一头，羊一只。今春抽补时，工作组即把这些东西补偿了错斗中农，干部、群众普遍的反映：土地法大纲上说烈属还同样分一份，咱村为什么不分给他反而还将他祖遗田产也全部分光？他有两个兄弟，是否能给他照管？
    （二）杨考则是个干属，在一九四一年参军，后调到三分区工作，一九四七年在二分区磁县病死。家有土地五亩六分，窑三串，牛二头，羊三只，粮食十余石，土改时，已将他家所有财产也分了，是否恰当请给解答一下。
    　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　蒋群有、赵三保、赵开政、张克勤蒋群有、赵三保、赵开政、张克勤同志：
    根据你们反映的情况，烈士蒋雪有妻已改嫁，又无子女，所遗土地房屋东西，参照群众意见，可给他同居的亲兄弟使用，最好先抽出一部为烈士修墓立碑以资纪念。纠偏中不应用烈士遗产补偿错斗中农。如目前此问题已处理，应按你村具体情况，另想妥善办法。
    关于杨考则遗产问题，其本人既无直系亲属，又无同居兄弟，可先为烈士修墓立碑，剩余财产可由农会村公所适当处理。
