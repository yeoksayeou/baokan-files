　　Not Letting Lint Stick
　　Fánróng Factory, Luò Xīn

　　Today the temperature and humidity are just right, making the work in the spinning room particularly easy. Seeing the rows of leather rollers spinning yarn smoothly without breaking, the workers looked relaxed and happy. Some went to the front of the machines to drink tea, some chatted and laughed, and some leaned against the pillars humming tunes. At this time, at machine number six, there was a winding female worker squatting on the ground, carefully wiping the machine with a piece of worn-out cloth. She meticulously polished the spindle tips, the heddle boards, the cage warp, the machine legs, and the spindle corners until they shone. This work required her to crouch in the workshop all the time, which was obviously difficult for her tall figure, but she always wiped so patiently. When a thread broke, she stood up to mend it, and after mending it, she squatted down again to wipe. When the winding whistle blew, she ran to wind the yarn, and after winding, she ran back to wipe, wiping until she was covered in sweat. She used her fingers to clean the corners that the cloth couldn't reach, getting her hands full of oily dirt. Her name is Shēn Jìngzhēn.

　　Speaking of Shēn Jìngzhēn, she is like her work, always burying herself in her work without a sound. She is skilled and very capable. Her hands never stop, and she does whatever needs doing. She mends broken threads, repairs broken machines, wipes dirty machines, sweeps dirty floors, and goes to wind yarn when the winding whistle blows. She works on one thing after another, patiently, meticulously, and diligently. Their number six machine has won the red flag three times.

　　Last week, because they kept winning the red flag, the workers became careless. Four of the six machine operators in their group were penalized because the machines were not clean. When Shēn Jìngzhēn saw this, she actively cleaned the machines without a word. Their worker Hé Xiùlián earned back two points, but they still didn't win the red flag because of too many penalties. Shēn Jìngzhēn said, "We can't let them penalize us anymore." She also said, "If the machines are not wiped clean, lint will stick to the yarn, and we can't produce good yarn. We can't let lint stick to the machines, and strive for both quantity and quality." She continued to wipe the machines and work diligently and patiently.

　　Here, the merits of every worker will not be buried. Today, the administrator and the team leader put a red circle under Shēn Jìngzhēn's name. This is a glorious symbol of reward for active work. Everyone went to congratulate her. The worker Mǎ Xiùróng smiled and said to her, "Look at how active you are, you've got another red circle!" Shēn Jìngzhēn just smiled and went back to work diligently and patiently.

　　不让沾花毛
    繁荣厂  洛辛
    今天温湿度很合适，细纱间的活特别好做，车工们看见一排排皮辘，很整齐的不断头的吐着纱线，都带着轻松与喜悦的神色，有的到车头喝喝茶水。有的说说笑笑，有的靠在柱子上哼着歌子。这时，在六号车上，有个络纱女工，她蹲在地上，用破包布。很细心的在擦车，她那样细致的把锭角、善板、笼经，车脚、锭角擦的放光发亮，这工作是一直要蜷曲在车间里作的，对她这高个儿显然是艰难的，但她总是那样耐心的擦着，头断了，就站起来接头，接完头又蹲下来擦，络纱哨响了，便飞跑去络纱，络完又跑回来擦，擦的满头是汗，用包布擦不着的拐角，便用指头掏着擦，擦的满手是油污。她的名字叫申静珍。
    提起申静珍，她这人和她的工作一样，做活总是那样不哼不响的埋头干，她有技术，也很能干，两手总没停过，见什么就作什么，头断了接头，车坏了就修车，车脏了就擦，地脏了就扫，络纱哨响了就去络纱，一件紧接着一件的干，又耐心，又细致，又紧张，她们六号车，曾得过三次红旗。
    上礼拜，由于不断的得红旗，车工们不注意了，她们那组六个看车工，就有四个因车上不清洁而被刨了分，申静珍见了，不哼不响的积极清洁车，她们车工何秀莲争回了两分，但仍因刨分太多，没有得上红旗，申静珍说：“咱们不能再让刨分了。”又说：“车擦不清洁，花毛沾到纱上，不能出好纱，我们不能让车上沾花毛，争取数量多，质量也好。”她又一直那样耐心的紧张的擦车做活。
    在这儿，每个工人们的好处都不会埋没的，今天管理员和组长，在申静珍的名下，划上了个红圈，这是一个积极工作得奖的光荣符号；大家都去给她道贺，车工马秀荣笑着向她说：“看你积极的又得了红圈了！”申静珍只笑了笑，便又那样紧张的耐心的工作去了。
