　　"The Eight Conditions Proposed by Chairman Mao Fully Represent the Demands of the People"
    PingShan Masses Discuss Current Events During Spring Festival
    [Report from this newspaper] The people of Pingshan City are enthusiastically celebrating the liberation of Tianjin and Beijing and joyfully celebrating the Spring Festival. In addition to various ways of comforting military families, on the evening of the 31st, gatherings were held in each street to discuss current affairs. Everyone unanimously expressed: "We support the eight peace proposals put forward by Chairman Mao and oppose the false peace conspiracy of the Nanjing Kuomintang reactionaries." Old man Wang Henglu, a military family member from East Street, explained from his own experience: only by realizing the eight peace conditions proposed by Chairman Mao can the Chinese people achieve true peace. The common people will only not suffer losses if they follow the Communist Party. Regarding Chiang Kai-shek's "retirement," he said, "This is just changing the soup but not the medicine." Wang Yuelin, a disabled veteran from East Street, angrily said at the forum: "The Kuomintang has always been a fraud when fighting Japan. The Anhui Incident alone killed thousands of us. After Japan surrendered, Chiang Kai-shek tore up the resolutions of the Political Consultative Conference and the ceasefire agreement, and launched a large-scale civil war. We, the common people, will never forget their killings, and we must settle this blood debt. Chairman Mao's proposal to punish war criminals completely represents the demands of our common people." He was even more indignant at the Nanjing Kuomintang's unreasonable release of top Japanese war criminal Okamura Neiji. Wang Yuelin was wounded three times during the War of Resistance Against Japan. He personally witnessed the Japanese army of war criminal Okamura Neiji carrying out the Three Alls Policy in Wutai, Fuping and other places, creating atrocities in no-man's-lands. He said, "Can the Chinese people who he burned, killed, and raped be counted?! The Kuomintang let go of such a big war criminal. We, the common people, will not allow it first!" Wang Yuelin's opinion was immediately approved by those present: "These war criminals must be punished, and blood debts must be paid!" When the issue of war criminals was discussed at the South Gate Street forum, two young children, a brother and sister named Qin, rushed in and asked, "Have they caught Chiang Kai-shek? He can't be spared!" The older boy said, "They bombed us so badly with planes! They must build houses for us." The girl added, "We must gather all the people together and thoroughly criticize them." The facts of the past few years have educated the people, and everyone said that they should not be fooled again. Everyone demanded that Chairman Mao, on behalf of the people, order the Nanjing Kuomintang to honestly accept these eight conditions of the people; otherwise, they should quickly send troops to the south of the Yangtze River and wipe them out, so that the Chinese people can achieve complete liberation as soon as possible.

　　“毛主席提的八项条件完全代表老百姓要求”
    平山群众春节谈时局
    【本报讯】平山城人民在热烈欢庆平津解放欢度春节。除以各种方式慰劳军属外，三十一日晚，各街并分别举行时事座谈会，大家一致表示：“拥护毛主席提出的八条和平主张，反对南京国民党反动派的假和平阴谋。”东街军属王恒禄老汉，他从自身的经历中说明：只有实现毛主席所提的八项和平条件，中国人民才能得到真正和平。老百姓只有跟着共产党走，才不会吃亏。对于蒋介石的“引退”，他说：“这是换汤不换药。”东街荣军王岳林在座谈会上气愤地说：“国民党在打日本时就一直是挂羊头卖狗肉，皖南事变一次就杀害了我们几千人，日本投降后，蒋介石又撕毁政协决议和停战协定，发动大规模内战，我们老百姓再也忘不了他们的杀害，我们一定要清算这笔血债。毛主席提出惩办战争罪犯，这完全代表了我们老百姓的要求。”对于南京国民党无理释放日本头等战犯冈村宁次，他更为愤慨。王岳林在抗日战争中曾负伤三次，他亲眼看见战犯冈村宁次的日军在五台、阜平等地肆行三光政策，制造无人区的暴行。他说：“他烧杀奸淫的中国老百姓还能够计算吗？！国民党把这样大的战犯放走了，我们老百姓就先不让它！”王岳林的意见，立即为到会者所赞同：“这些战犯一定要惩办，血债必须偿还！”南关街座谈会当讨论战犯问题时，有秦姓兄妹两个小孩子急忙跑进去问：“把蒋介石捉住了没有？可不能饶了他！”较大的男孩子说：“他们用飞机炸得我们好厉害呵！一定要他们给我们盖房子。”女孩子补充说：“要把老百姓都集合起来，好好斗一斗他们。”几年来的事实已经教育了人民，大家都说不要再上他的当。大家要求毛主席代表老百姓命令南京国民党，老实地接受人民的这八个条件；不然就快些发兵下江南，把他们一扫而光，使中国人民早日获得彻底解放。　　　　　　（苏幼民、林沫、韩朝阳）
