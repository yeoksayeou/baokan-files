[Jizhong News] Wang Yaoting, a member of the Cang City Federation of Industry and Commerce and director of the cigarette industry, violated the decrees of the democratic government and engaged in speculation and profiteering. The municipal government has dismissed him from his post. Wang Yaoting usually pretended to be active and infiltrated the organization of the Federation of Industry and Commerce after the liberation of Cang City. However, he was not working for the development of legitimate industry and commerce in Cang City, implementing the decrees of the democratic government, and representing the interests of legitimate industrialists and merchants, but consistently undermining the national economy and engaging in illegal speculation. To put up a front, he opened the "Xintai Freight Depot," openly engaging in gambling, which has been investigated and caught by the government twice. Wang Yaoting even considered this to be damaging to his "face." The freight depot hung a sign saying "Buying and Selling on Behalf of Customers," but in reality, it was a speculative business, solely aimed at profiting from transactions.

　　沧市工商联合会委员王耀亭
  　投机倒把被撤职
    【冀中讯】沧市工商联合会委员兼卷烟业的行业主任王耀亭，违犯民主政府法令，投机倒把，市政府已把他撤职。王耀亭平时假装积极，自沧市解放，就钻入工商联合会的组织；但他不是为了沧市正当工商业的发展，贯彻民主政府的法令和代表正当工商业者的利益，而是一贯的破坏国民经济，进行非法投机。他为了应付门面，特开设“新泰客货栈”，竟公开聚赌，已被政府查获两次。王耀亭还认为有伤他的“体面”。货栈里挂着“代客买卖”的招牌，实际上是一种投机生意，专为在成交中捞一把。
