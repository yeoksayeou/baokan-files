　　Far Eastern Commission Soviet Representative Pan Youxin
  　Again Criticizes US Economic Policy Toward Japan
    Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, February 25th: TASS, Washington reports: On February 17th, Soviet representative Pan Youxin at the Far Eastern Commission once again condemned the US government's unilateral instruction to MacArthur on December 10th of last year to implement the so-called "stabilization" plan for the Japanese economy. He condemned the US attempt to unilaterally change the Allied control system over Japan. Pan Youxin reiterated the points from January 17th, stating: Last September, the Soviet representative suggested not restricting the development of Japan's peaceful industries, but it is necessary to prohibit the restoration of Japan's war industries, and the relevant countries should establish joint control over Japan to prevent new Japanese aggression. Last November, the US government opposed the Soviet proposal, saying that they did not need such a proposal because the Far Eastern Commission had already adopted decisions on economic issues. However, only a month later, the US government issued instructions to MacArthur without going through the Far Eastern Commission, violating the control system over Japan stipulated in the Potsdam Declaration. Pan Youxin emphasized: "These actions by the US government can only be interpreted as intending to make the Japanese economy subservient to the interests of US monopoly capitalist groups, harming Japan's economic independence." Pan Youxin cited facts to prove this, saying: According to the instructions of the US authorities, the Japanese government is revising labor laws to restrict the democratic rights of the Japanese working people, and is preparing to strictly control wages and implement corporate "rationalization" plans that involve mass layoffs of employees. In addition, the US occupying authorities indulge Japanese large conglomerates that participated in the war of aggression, control Japan's foreign trade, and seize the privilege of investing freely in Japan and purchasing Japanese property. Mr. Pan firmly maintained that the US government should provide information on MacArthur's implementation of the Far Eastern Commission's economic resolutions regarding Japan, especially information on the implementation of resolutions to eliminate Japan's military-industrial potential.

　　远东委会苏代表潘友新
  　再斥美对日经济政策
    【新华社陕北二十五日电】据塔斯社华盛顿讯：二月十七日，苏联代表潘友新在远东委员会上就美政府于去年十二月十日擅自指令麦克阿瑟实行所谓“稳定”日本经济计划一事，再度斥责美国企图片面改变盟国对日管制制度。潘友新重申其一月十七日的论点称：去年九月，苏联代表曾建议不限制日本和平工业的发展，但必须禁止恢复日本战争工业，并由有关各国建立对日共同管制，以防止日本新的侵略。去年十一月，美国政府反对苏联建议，说他们不需要那种建议，因为远东委员会已采取了有关经济问题的决定。但不过一个月以后，美国政府却不经过远东委员会而向麦克阿瑟发出了违反波茨坦决议所规定的对日管制制度的指令。潘友新强调地说：“美国政府的这些行为只能解释为打算使日本经济服从于美国独占资本家集团的利益，危害日本经济的独立”。潘友新并列举事实加以证明称：根据美国当局的训令，日本政府正修订劳工法以限制日本劳动人民的民主权利，正准备严格管制工资和实行大批解雇职工的企业“合理化”计划。此外，美国占领当局放纵参加过侵略战争的日本大康采恩，控制日本对外贸易，攫取在日本自由投资与购买日本财产的特权。潘氏坚主美政府应提供麦克阿瑟执行远东委员会对日经济决议的情报，尤其是关于执行肃清日本军事工业潜力决议的情报。
