Xinhua News Agency, North China, February 21st: Beijing Seventh Dispatch: Wei Ningdun reports: Several weeks ago, when I was driving south of Beijing in a jeep, I encountered people transporting grain northward along hundreds of miles of highway. There were hundreds of ox carts, mule carts, long lines of donkeys, and people pushing large-wheeled carts and carrying shoulder poles. When I asked them where they were going, they said to a small town not far from Beijing, where the government was storing grain, oil, salt, and other necessities in preparation for immediate transport into the city upon Beijing's liberation.

After the liberation of Beijing, the democratic municipal government immediately began to rectify the chaotic economy left by the Kuomintang and create conditions to guarantee the people's livelihood. Two things had to be done, and done quickly: sufficient food and fuel had to be put on the market to control prices and stabilize the economy, and the people had to be fully supplied with stable currency to replace the hyperinflated gold yuan.

Weeks of meticulous organization were required to create these conditions rapidly after liberation. When General Lin Biao's troops marched from Manchuria to Beijing and Tianjin, preliminary work had already been done to mobilize grain for these two cities. This was an arduous task for the government trading company. The railways and highways had all been destroyed by the Kuomintang, the war was ongoing, and the army had first priority on grain and transportation. In addition, the government had issued instructions in advance: not to buy too much from the peasants, as this would leave them without the necessary grain reserves before the summer harvest. Government workers and Communist Party members throughout the countryside were buying food and mobilizing the people to undertake transportation. At the same time, a huge temporary transportation service team was established, and all kinds of transportation vehicles were organized into the team. The team even had its own doctors and veterinarians; road signs were posted, and special rest stations were set up along the way, specializing in providing food and lodging for the transportation teams. Militiamen from the villages along the highway patrolled in sections. However, despite these preparations, many people who volunteered for this work still encountered difficulties. The roads were often so bad that they had to keep their ox carts moving constantly. I often saw people sleeping on their bumpy carts, taking turns to rest while their companions took care of the livestock.

But the grain always arrived. By the time of Beijing's liberation, more than 30 million kilograms of grain had been stockpiled near the city, and considerable quantities of cooking oil and salt were ready. At the same time, 70,000 tons of coal were stored. With such a quantity of necessities on hand, the trading company was now able to eliminate the black market and drive out speculative merchants. The trading company opened many public stores in the city, making it much easier for citizens to buy daily necessities. The trading company announced its price list for daily necessities, supplying citizens at prices lower than the market. This immediately stabilized the market.

I have seen this process in many newly liberated cities. Based on my observation, it takes two weeks to a month after liberation (depending on the size of the city) to bring the market back to normal.

The first action is now underway in Beijing. As of February 5th, more than 60 million kilograms of flour and rice, 900 tons of coal, and large quantities of oil and salt have been transported into Beijing via the newly repaired railways. Grain is the main standard of prices, and when its price is low, the prices of other commodities follow suit. The head of the Beijing Trading Company told me that transporting grain to Beijing was not only difficult but also quite expensive. He said, "In the first stage, the most important thing is to ensure that citizens have grain in their homes, so we have to bear the losses caused by this." This means that the people in the old liberated areas are making some voluntary sacrifices to help the newly liberated people stand on their own feet. The head of the company concluded, "My current job is not to make money for the government, but to ensure that the people can obtain enough grain and fuel at low prices."

### 人民政府供应必需品　北平市场迅速稳定

　　人民政府供应必需品
  　北平市场迅速稳定
    老区群众积极运输粮煤
  　帮助新区人民站得起来
    【新华社华北二十一日电】北平七日通讯：魏宁顿报导：数星期前，当我乘吉普车驶经北平以南时，沿着数百哩的公路上，我碰到老百姓向北运送粮食。这里有数以百计的牛车、骡车，长列的毛驴，以及推着大轮车和挑着扁担的人们。当我问他们到那里去时，他们说到离北平不远的一个小镇，而事实上是政府正在那里贮存谷物、油、盐及其他必需品以备北平解放时立即运入城内。
    北平解放后，民主市政府立即开始整顿国民党遗留下的紊乱的经济，并造成保证人民生活的条件。两件事必须要作，而且很快的作了：必须要有足够的食物与燃料投入市场以控制物价和稳定经济，以及必须充分供给人民以稳固的货币以代替那恶性膨胀的金圆券。
    为了在解放后迅速造成这一条件，需要几星期细致的组织工作。当林彪将军所部从满洲开向北平、天津时，就已作了为这两个城市动员粮食的初步工作。这是政府贸易公司的一件艰苦的任务。铁路和公路统被国民党毁坏了，战争在进行着，而军队有要求粮食与运输的第一等优先权，加上政府又有指示在前：不许向农民购买太多，因为这样会使农民在夏收前没有必需的存粮。整个乡村中的政府工作人员与共产党员都在进行购卖食粮并动员老百姓担任运输。与此同时，一个巨大的临时运输服务队成立了，一切各式各样的运输工具都被组织到运输队中去，运输队中甚至有他们自己的医生及兽医；路标贴起来了，路上设置了特别的休息站，专门供应来往运输队的食宿。沿公路各村民兵们分段的巡逻着。但是，虽然有这些准备，许多自动作这一工作的老百姓仍然受到困难。路时常是这样壤，以致他们只好使牛车永远不停地走下去。我有许多次看到老百姓躺在他们颠簸的车上睡觉，当他们的同伴照管牲口的时候，就轮到他们来休息。
    但是谷物总是运到了。在北平解放时，已在城附近积存了三千多万公斤的粮食，并准备好了相当数量的食油与食盐。同时贮存了七万吨煤。贸易公司有了这样数量的必需品在手上，现在就能够扫除黑市，驱逐投机操纵的商人。贸易公司在市内开设了许多公营商店，因此，市民购买日用生活必需品以很大便利。贸易公司公布了它的日用必需品的价格表，以低于市场的价格供应市民。这样立即稳定了市场。
    我曾在许多新解放城市中看到这一过程。根据我的观察，解放后有两个星期至一个月的时间（这要看城市的大小而定）就可以使市场处于正常状态。
    第一个行动现正在北平进行中。截至二月五日为止，六千余万公斤面粉、大米，九百吨煤，大量的油与食盐已经由新修理好的铁路运进了北平。粮食是物价的主要标准，当它的价格便宜时，其他商品价格也就跟着下跌。北平贸易公司负责人告我说：运输粮食至北平不仅交通困难而且运费颇昂。他说：“在第一阶段，最要紧的是必须使市民家中有粮食，所以我们不得不承受因此而引起的损失。”这就是说，老解放区的人民在做着某些自愿的牺牲，以便使新解放的人民站得起来。该负责人最后说：“我目前的工作不是要为政府赚钱，而是要使人民能以低廉的价格获得足够的粮食与燃料。”
