　　Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 14th -- The first group of over eight hundred demobilized soldiers of the People's Liberation Army from the Yan'an Directly Subordinate District of Shaanxi-Gansu-Ningxia, after two months of intensive training, have gloriously rejoined the front lines. However, due to the existence of two completely opposite working methods—the mass line and the non-mass line—in the mobilization of demobilized PLA soldiers in various counties, the achievements of the return movement are extremely uneven across the district. In Ansai and Zhidan counties, demobilized soldiers responded to the government's call and returned in droves. One young soldier, who had lost contact with his unit, immediately registered with the government to request a return upon hearing the government's mobilization announcement. In the areas bordering Ansai and Zhidan counties, many revolutionary military family members persuaded their sons to return, even entrusting others or personally traveling to other counties such as Suide, Mizhi, and Hengshan to find their sons and bring them back. The enthusiastic return of demobilized soldiers in Ansai and Zhidan counties is due to the fact that the Communist Party and government organs in these two counties conscientiously adopted the mass line working method, making the return movement a truly mass-based movement. First, under the unified leadership of the return work committee, both counties convened meetings of cadres at the district, township, and village levels to repeatedly explain the political significance of the return work, ensuring that all cadres truly and consciously recognized the importance of the return work, and thus actively implemented it. Second, through cadres at all levels, mass meetings were held to widely publicize the victorious situation to the peasant masses, calling on demobilized soldiers to return honorably and guaranteeing that returning soldiers would not be subject to any punishment. At the same time, work to provide preferential treatment to revolutionary military families was further actively promoted. With the township as the unit, respected township cadres and active elements among the peasants jointly formed committees for preferential treatment of military families (administrative villages and larger natural villages organized groups for preferential treatment of military families), convening meetings of cadres, village meetings, and meetings of revolutionary military families, and engaging in cordial talks with demobilized soldiers to sincerely solicit their opinions and those of their families on the government's work in providing preferential treatment to military families and the return work. This mobilized the masses to address the difficulties of military families, especially those of newly returned soldiers, promptly and effectively, and to extend condolences to all revolutionary military families and families of martyrs, improving and strengthening the work of substitute farming and other systems for preferential treatment of families of martyrs and military personnel. When demobilized soldiers returned, enthusiastic send-off meetings were held in all villages, townships, districts, and counties. During the centralized training period in the county, it was necessary to ensure that returning soldiers were well-fed and clothed, that their lives were regulated, and that political education was intensified. The system for returning soldiers to request leave was fair and reasonable, subject to the approval of the squad leader. However, the methods used by the Ganquan County government for the return work were completely opposite to those of Ansai and Zhidan. There, a method of working completely detached from the masses existed. The deputy county magistrate of Ganquan instructed his secretary to draft instructions for the return work, saying: if necessary, family members of the demobilized soldiers could be called upon to replace them, and if individual demobilized soldiers were unwilling to return, it would not matter if they were tied up or arrested. In the return movement in the county, serious incidents of assault even occurred. Due to this coercive command style in leadership, although the return work in Ganquan County took three months, the number of returnees was still less than one-third of the planned target.

　　陕甘宁延安直属分区
  　八百归队战士重上前线
    【新华社陕北十四日电】陕甘宁延安直属分区首批八百余名解放军归队战士，于集中训练两个月后，已光荣地重上前线。但是由于各县在动员解放军离队战士归队的工作上，存在着群众路线和非群众路线这样两种截然相反的工作方法，使归队运动的成绩在分区范围内极不平衡。在安塞和志丹县，离队战士响应政府号召纷纷归队。一个与部队失掉联络的青年战士听到政府动员归队的消息，立即自动向政府报名要求归队。安塞及志丹两县交界的地区，许多革命军人家属规劝自己的儿子归队，甚至托人或亲自跑到外县如绥德、米脂、横山等地找寻儿子归队。安塞、志丹两县离队战士归队如此热烈，因为两县共产党和政府机关认真采取了群众路线的工作方法，使归队运动真正成为一个群众性的运动。首先，在归队工作委员会统一领导之下，两县都召开了区、乡、村各级干部会议，反复说明归队工作的政治意义，使所有干部真正自觉地认识归队工作的重要性；因而积极执行归队工作；其次，通过各级干部分别召开群众大会，向农民群众广泛宣传胜利形势，号召离队战士光荣归队，保证归队战士不受任何处分。与此同时进一步积极进行优待革命军人家属的工作。以乡为单位，找有威信的乡干部和农民中的积极分子共同组成优待军人家属委员会（行政村和较大自然村组织优待军人家属小组），分别召开干部会议、村民会议、革命军人家属会议，并找离队战士亲切谈话，诚恳地征求离队战士本人及其家属对政府优待军属家属工作及归队工作的意见，发动群众切身而迅速地解决军人家属尤其刚归队战士家属的困难，慰问一切革命军人家属及烈士家属，改善与健全优待烈属、军属的代耕工作及其他各种制度。在离队战士归队时，不论村、乡、区、县一律召开热烈动人的欢送会；在县上集中训练时期，必须保证归队战士吃饱穿暖，生活有规律，并加紧进行政治教育。归队战士请假外出，制度上做到公平合理，由队长批准。但是甘泉县政府所有归队工作的方法与安塞、志丹两者完全相反。那里存在着一种完全脱离群众工作方法。甘泉副县长嘱咐秘书起草归队工作指示说：必要时可叫离队战士家中的人出而顶替，个别离队战士不肯归队则绑起来或抓一下也没关系。该县在归队运动中甚至发生严重的打人事件。由于领导工作上的这种强迫命令作风，使得甘泉县归队工作虽费了三个月的时间，归队人数还不到预定计划的三分之一。
