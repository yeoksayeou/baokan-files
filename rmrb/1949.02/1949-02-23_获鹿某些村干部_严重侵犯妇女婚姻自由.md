　　Certain Village Cadres in Huolu
  　Seriously Infringe Upon Women's Freedom of Marriage
    [Our Newspaper] In some villages in Huolu, when dealing with marriage issues, some village cadres illegally restrict women from divorcing, and some district-level cadres accommodate the backward consciousness of the masses and fail to deal with them in a timely manner. For example, in Wangjiazhuang Village, Eighth District, when a couple divorced, the village chief detained the woman and held a mass meeting to ask the masses whether they should divorce; in Zhangying, a matchmaker tied up a woman (woman is sixteen, man is thirteen) because the woman requested a divorce, and forced her to return to her husband's family; phenomena such as stripping off clothes and tying up to freeze also occurred when the Shangzhuang Farmers' Association resolved marital relationships. It is even more common for village cadres to refuse to issue letters of introduction in order to restrict divorce. Some district cadres showed a tendency to "take care of the village cadres" on these issues, using the excuse that the village cadres did not understand and did not deal with them. Village cadres did not issue letters of introduction for divorce, and some district cadres did not resolve them because they did not have a letter of introduction from the village. This serious bureaucratic style, although criticized by the county party committee, has not yet attracted attention. The reason for the above phenomenon is that some district and village cadres have feudal ideas, value men over women, and hold the attitude of "rather break a mountain than break up a marriage." In order to overcome the current serious infringement of women's human rights, the county party committee proposed: to open up the minds of cadres, eliminate the concept of valuing men over women in the minds of cadres, correctly publicize and implement the marriage policy, and gradually let the masses consciously grasp it. The illegal infringement of human rights by some village cadres should be criticized, educated, and severely punished.

　　获鹿某些村干部
  　严重侵犯妇女婚姻自由
    【本报讯】获鹿有些村庄在处理婚姻问题上，发生某些村干非法限制女方离婚，以及一部分区级干部，迁就群众的落后意识，不及时处理。如八区王家庄村一夫妇离婚，村长把女方扣押，开大会问群众是否该离；张营一个媒人，因为女方提出离婚（女十六，男十三），便把女方绑起来，强制回婆家；上庄农会解决夫妇关系时，也发生了脱衣服绑冻等现象。村干部为限制离婚，不给开介绍信的事更为普遍，某些区干部对这些问题则表现了“照顾村干部”的迁就现象，借口村干部不通而不处理，村干部不给离婚的开介绍信，有的区干因没村介绍信不予解决。这种严重的上述官僚主义作风，虽经县委批评，仍未引起注意。发生以上现象的原因，是部分区村干部，存在着封建观点，重男轻女，抱着“能拆一座山，不破一门亲”的态度。为了克服目前存在的严重侵犯妇女人权的行为，该县县委提出：打通干部思想，肃清干部思想上的重男轻女观念，正确的宣传和执行婚姻政策，逐渐让群众自觉的掌握。对某些村干非法侵犯人权的行为，进行批评、教育，严重的应给予处分。
