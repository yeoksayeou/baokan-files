Achievements of Employees in Technology Improvement at a Military Factory in Jiaodong
Wang Ruowang

One of the main characteristics of public enterprises in the liberated areas is the upsurge of mass-based technology improvement campaigns. The huge role that this technology improvement campaign plays in increasing productivity, reducing costs, improving quality, saving labor, and reducing the risk of fatigue and injury can be fully demonstrated by the practice of a military factory in Jiaodong.

In the past five years, the factory's output has increased fortyfold due to mass technological improvements and innovations. However, the significance of technological improvements cannot be fully demonstrated by simply looking at output. Its significance is also reflected in improving quality, reducing costs, and reducing the number of work-related injuries. According to a rough calculation of the labor and raw materials saved after thirty-one technological improvements in the factory in the first half of 1948, the monthly savings was 6,685,600 North Sea Currency. Secondly, due to the addition of automatic devices to some machines, the number of worker injuries has also been greatly reduced. The average number of finger injuries per month was five or six in previous years, but now it is only two or three at most, and the intensity of labor is relatively reduced compared to 1946.

According to statistics for nine months of 1948, the factory's employees made more than 60 technological improvements and innovations. These improvements were based on the existing conditions of production in the liberated areas and solved technical difficulties practically and ingeniously. For example, in the past, the copper casings of bullets would have flash (unevenness at the mouth of the cartridge case). In order to spin off the flash, two shifts of workers were required to operate, but now it is completely unnecessary. Sun Yongzheng and Song Tonghai jointly researched and added a flash spinning tool to the lathe at the same time, which saved a procedure and reduced the use of a machine. After the casing was finished, it used to be taken off by hand, which was time-consuming and dangerous. Worker Guo Wenzhao installed a top rod to automatically push it out. After Jiang Mingqing and Sun Zongxiu improved the cutting method of oil paper used for packing, ten taels of oil paper could be saved per box. Carpenter Xing Lifeng converted the hand saw into a foot pedal saw, reducing fatigue and increasing the rate by three times. Lu Yuedong and Li Shiyong jointly researched and spent half a year making an automatic powder loading machine. One machine can perform four procedures at the same time, the amount of powder is easy to control, and the efficiency is increased by seven times. Yu Shuren is a second-class grade two worker. In order to increase production, he suggested reducing the gear wheels on the press, which resulted in a 40% increase in production. In the past, copper casings had to be spun on a lathe, which required an extra procedure, six people to work, and several lathes. Yu Shuren also suggested improving the first three procedures of the casing stamping to reduce one procedure and save six workers and lathes.

The factory's technology improvement campaign has the following characteristics: (1) Technicians, workers, and apprentices, whether carpenters, furnace workers, or packing workers, all made improvements and innovations. In the second half of last year, seven apprentices won awards for their creations, fifteen were third-class workers, twenty-one were second-class workers, and four first-class workers successfully created. Apprentice Wang Maoxue had two improvements. This fact proves that it is not only the most technically skilled people who can create and improve, and that the technology improvement campaign should become a broad mass movement. (2) The effect of each creation is diverse, some are two-pronged, and some are three-pronged. For example, Yu Shuren's suggestion to eliminate the purple casing procedure produced four results: it saved six laborers, saved several lathes, and improved quality and output. (3) The factory director and some staff members are knowledgeable in technology, and they generally encourage and assist workers in their improvements, which is one of the important factors in mobilizing the wisdom and creativity of the masses. (4) Last year, the factory's workers generally learned arithmetic and general technical knowledge, which also played a significant role in the factory's employees' technological improvements and innovations. Last year, all employees, except for a few staff members, were divided into groups A, B, C, and D, ensuring that they had six hours a week to learn arithmetic.

The factory also has some shortcomings in its treatment of employees' improvements and innovations: First, the administrative leadership does not pay enough attention to the technical improvements of workers and apprentices, and some technical improvements are not even investigated and registered by the industrial affairs section. Second, most of the workers' technological improvements are spontaneous, and some even carry out improvement research secretly, fearing that they will be laughed at or complained about by their superiors if they fail. Third, some leaders often inadvertently throw cold water on those who are researching and improving, and sometimes they do not study and ignore the workers' suggestions for improvement, which makes the workers less confident. Therefore, it is necessary to formulate some systems in the future. For example, workers should be organized to study technology, and workers' inventions that are recognized by a certain technical research institution should be allowed to use some materials and machines. Even if the experiment fails, it should not be regarded as a waste. In the cost calculation, an improvement experiment fee should be added, etc.

　　胶东某军工厂职工改进技术的成就
    王若望
    解放区公营企业中的主要特点之一，是群众性的改进技术运动的高涨。这种技术改进运动对于增进生产力、减低成本、提高质量、节省人工、减少疲劳和受伤的危险各方面所起的作用之巨大，仅从胶东某军工厂一个厂的实践中即可得到完全的证明。
    该厂在五年来因群众性的技术上的改进与创造即使产量提高了四十倍。但仅仅从产量上看，还不能完全显示技术改进的意义。它的意义同时还表现在提高质量，减低成本，减少因公受伤的数字上。根据一九四八年上半年该厂三十一种技术改进后，节约人工、原料的粗略核算，每月即可节省北海币六百六十八万五千六百元。其次，由于某些机器增加了自动装置，工人因公受伤的数目也大大减少，前年每月手指受伤者平均有五、六人之多，现在每月至多只有二、三人，而劳动强度比一九四六年亦相对地减轻了。
    根据一九四八年九个月的统计，该厂职工在技术上的改进与创造有六十余种之多。这些改进都是根据目前解放区生产的现有条件，既实际又巧妙地解决了技术上的困难。如以前子弹铜壳出来有飞翅（弹壳口的参差不齐之处），为了旋光飞翅，用两个班的工人操作，现在完全不用了。孙永政、宋同海两人共同研究在床子上同时添一个旋光飞翅的刀，这样就省了一遍手续，少用一部机器。车好壳后，以前是用手取下来，多费时间还有危险。工人郭文兆装置一根顶棍，自动顶出来。姜明清、孙宗秀改进装箱所用油纸的裁法后，每箱可节省油纸十两。木工邢立凤把手拉锯改成用脚蹬，减少疲劳，提高速率三倍。吕岳东和李世永共同研究，费时半年，做了一个自动装药机，一个机器同时作四遍手续，药量也易掌握，效率提高七倍。于树仁是个二等二级工人，他为了要提高产量，提议在压力机上减少牙轮，结果使产量提高百分之四十。以前铜壳出来还要旋床去旋，多一遍手续，要六个人干活，占用好几台旋床，于树仁又建议从冲壳时头三遍进行改良，可减去一遍手续，且能节省六个人工和旋床。
    该厂技术改进运动有以下几个特点：（一）不论技师、工人、学徒，不论木工、炉工、装箱工，都有改进和创造。去年下半年的技术改进，学徒创造获奖者有七人，其他是三等工人十五人，二等工人二十一人，一等工人创造成功者四人。学徒王茂学就有两种改进。这个事实证明不是只有技术最高的人才能创造和改进，技术改进运动应该成为广泛的群众性的运动。（二）每种创造所生的效果是多样的，有的是一举两得，有的是一举三得，譬如于树仁关于免去紫壳手续的建议，就产生了四个结果：节约了六个劳动力，节省了几台旋床，提高了质量、产量。（三）该厂厂长及一些工作人员都是通晓技术的，他们一般的对工人的改进都能加以鼓励和协助，这是发动群众的智慧和创造的重要因素之一。（四）去年该厂工人普遍学习了算术和一般技术知识，这对于该厂职工在技术上的改进创造也有甚大作用。去年全体职工除了少数工作人员外，都编为甲、乙、丙、丁组，保证一个星期有六小时学算术。
    该厂在对待职工的改进创造上，也还存在若干缺点：第一，行政领导上对工人、学徒技术上的改进还不够重视，有些技术上的改进，甚至工务科也没有调查登记。第二，工人的技术改进大都是自发的，甚至还有人偷偷的进行改进研究，怕失败了被人笑话，被上级埋怨。第三，有些领导人员常常无意间给正在研究改进的人泼冷水，有时对工人的改进建议不加研究，搁置不理，会使工人信心不高。所以今后订出一些制度，是必要的。如组织工人研究技术，工人的发明经过一定技术研究机构认可者，允许其使用一部分材料和机器，即使试验失败，也不能看作是浪费；在成本计算中，应添入一项改进试验费等。
