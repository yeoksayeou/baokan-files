　　Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 13th. Reports from various sources: The Siamese fascist government has formally participated in the British authorities' offensive against the Malayan people in Malaya, according to the secret Anglo-Siamese "anti-communist" pact signed in late November last year. On the morning of the 9th, Siamese regular troops and security forces, with the coordination of the British Air Force, launched their first offensive against the Malayan people's anti-British guerrillas in the Kedah region on the Siamese-Malayan border. The battle is currently underway. According to the agreement between Britain and Siam, nineteen Siamese army, navy and air force officers arrived in Johor a few days ago to receive so-called "jungle warfare" training from the British; the work of equipping the Siamese army by the British is also underway. At the same time, the Siamese fascist government has sent more troops to the Vietnamese-Siamese border near Isarac in Laos to "monitor" the local Vietnamese anti-French guerrillas (Agence France-Presse). This is the result of the exchange of military delegations between Siam and the French authorities in Vietnam in December last year with British support. British imperialism's efforts to win over the Siamese fascists to participate in anti-people activities in Southeast Asia precisely demonstrate that it has lost confidence in dealing with the local colonial independence movement with its own strength.

  　暹罗配合作帮凶
    【新华社陕北十三日电】各方报导：暹罗法西斯政府已根据去年十一月下旬所签订的英暹“反共”密约，正式参与马来亚英国当局对马来亚人民的进攻。九日清晨，暹正规军与保安部队在英空军配合下，首次对暹罗马来亚边境吉打地区的马来亚人民抗英游击队发动进攻。战事现正进行中。根据英暹间的协定，十九名暹陆海空军军官已于日前抵达柔佛，接受英方的所谓“丛林战卫”的训练；由英方装备暹军的工作亦在进行中。与此同时，暹法西斯政府已加派军队至老挝之伊萨拉克附近的越暹边境，对当地越南反法游击队进行“监视”（法新社）。这是暹罗与越南法当局于去年十二月间在英方支持下互派军事代表团举行商谈的结果。英帝国主义拉拢暹罗法西斯参加东南亚反人民活动，恰恰表明它对于以自己力量来应付当地殖民地独立运动，已丧失信心。
