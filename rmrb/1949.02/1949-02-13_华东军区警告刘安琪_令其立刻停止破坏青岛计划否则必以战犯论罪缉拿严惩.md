Xinhua News Agency, East China, February 11th: Reliable sources report that Liu Anqi, commander of the Kuomintang's 11th Pacification Zone in Qingdao, is actively arranging the destructive sabotage of Qingdao's important municipal construction and factory equipment. Liu Anqi has decided that before retreating, he will thoroughly destroy the Qingdao's major port, docks, water sources, power plants, the Zhongfang and Qilu companies, and the equipment of many other important factories, and is preparing to coerce all public servants and teachers in the city to flee with him. Fan Chengzhou, the manager of the Kuomintang bureaucrat-capital Zhongfang Company, has completed all preparations to destroy the factory. This plan by the Kuomintang bandit army to destroy Qingdao's national wealth began planning as early as the end of last year. On December 17th of last year, the Qingdao bandit army shipped 20,000 kilograms of explosives from Shanghai for the purpose of destruction during the retreat. In response, a spokesperson for the East China Military Region Headquarters of the People's Liberation Army issued a serious warning to Liu Anqi, ordering him to immediately cease this heinous plan. If he dares to implement such destruction in a frenzy, then Liu Anqi himself and the Kuomintang officers executing the destruction plan will be considered war criminals and will be severely punished without leniency once apprehended.

　　华东军区警告刘安琪
    令其立刻停止破坏青岛计划否则必以战犯论罪缉拿严惩
    【新华社华东十一日电】确息：青岛国民党守军第十一绥区司令刘安琪，正积极布置对青岛重要市政建设和工厂设备的毁灭性的破坏。刘安琪决定于撤退前，将青市大港、码头、水源地、发电厂、中纺、齐鲁两公司及其他许多重要工厂设备彻底破坏，并准备胁迫全市公教人员，一同逃走。国民党官僚资本中纺公司经理范澄州，已完成一切破坏该厂的准备。国民党匪军此项破坏青岛国家财富的计划，早于去年年底即开始筹划，去年十二月十七日，青岛匪军由上海运来炸药二万公斤，即作为撤退时破坏之用。对此，人民解放军华东军区司令部发言人特向刘安琪提出严重警告，令其立刻停止此项罪恶计划，如果他胆敢丧心病狂地实行此种破坏，则刘安琪本人及执行该破坏计划的国民党主官、将被认为战争罪犯，一旦缉获来案必予严厉惩办，决不姑宽。
