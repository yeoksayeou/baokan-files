　　Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, January 30th: TASS, Tokyo, January 27th: Akahata recently published a statement by the Politburo of the Japanese Communist Party regarding the recent national election, stating that the broad masses of the Japanese people, especially the working class (particularly in the industrial areas of Tokyo and Osaka), have demonstrated their revolutionary determination in the general election. Despite the cruel persecution of the election law and the anti-communist movements launched by other political parties, the JCP still won the support of more than three million people, thus gaining thirty-five seats in the House of Representatives. The statement forcefully stated that for the liberation of the people and to gain national independence, further unity of the people's forces is necessary. The Japanese Communist Party will continue to fight against unfavorable amendments to labor legislation, against the dismissal of workers, against heavy taxes, and to expose illegal activities and corruption. In this struggle, advanced members of the Labor-Farmer Party and the Socialist Party must work together with the Communist Party.
　　At the same time, JCP leader Nozaka commented on the results of the election, saying that Japanese workers support the Communist Party because it truly defends their interests. Nozaka further pointed out that the Japanese people are striving to rebuild the economy, improve living standards, and achieve Japan's complete independence. Nozaka forcefully stated that to achieve these tasks, a broad democratic front must be established.
