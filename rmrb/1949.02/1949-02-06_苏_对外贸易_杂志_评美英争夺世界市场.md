Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 29th. TASS reports: The latest issue of the Soviet magazine "Foreign Trade" published an article discussing the fierce contradictions between the United States and the United Kingdom in the world market. Discussing the struggle between the US and the UK for manganese ore resources, the magazine stated: American steel trusts are working to establish control over major manganese resources, 60% of which are controlled by the UK. The Marshall Plan stipulates that the UK hand over 250,000 tons of manganese ore to the US annually, and it also stipulates that US monopoly capitalists can freely exploit the UK's ore veins. Although the UK is stubbornly resisting the US invasion of manganese ore resources, the US is trying to forcibly break the UK's manganese ore monopoly by making treaties with the UK's autonomous governments. To this end, the US is trying to get the South African Federal Government to agree to increase steel deliveries in exchange for manganese ore. On the other hand, it has proposed to the Indian government that if India supplies the US with manganese ore, it will provide India with dollar and goods loans. In the world cotton market, the UK is also in conflict with the growing US pressure. The US is trying to use Marshall Plan aid to establish its control over this market. Whereas the UK was previously able to control the Egyptian cotton market, Egypt is no longer concluding any agreements to sell large quantities of cotton orders to the UK at low prices. Pakistan is also no longer giving the UK priority in purchasing cotton.

  　评美英争夺世界市场
    【新华社陕北二十九日电】塔斯社讯：最近一期的苏联“对外贸易”杂志曾著文论述美英之间在世界市场上的剧烈矛盾。在论及美英之间争夺锰矿资源的斗争时，该杂志称：美国的钢业托辣斯，正努力建立对百分之六十都在英国控制下的主要锰矿资源的控制。马歇尔计划规定英国每年交与美国二十五万吨锰矿苗，而且还规定，美国垄断资本家可以自由地利用英国的矿脉。虽然，英国正在顽强地抵抗美国对锰矿资源的入侵，但是，美国则努力用与英国自治领政府缔约的方法，来强行打破英国的锰矿垄断。为了这一目的，美国正试图使南非联邦政府赞成增加钢的交货，以交换锰矿。另一方面，它又向印度政府提议，如果印度供给美国锰矿，则它将给印度美元和货物贷款。在世界棉花市场上，英国亦与日渐增长的美国压力相冲突。美国正试图以马歇尔计划的援助，来建立其对这一市场的控制。如果说，以前英国能设法控制埃及的棉花市场，而现在，埃及却不再缔结任何以低价售与英国大量棉花订货的协定。巴基斯坦也不再给予英国以购买棉花的优先权。
