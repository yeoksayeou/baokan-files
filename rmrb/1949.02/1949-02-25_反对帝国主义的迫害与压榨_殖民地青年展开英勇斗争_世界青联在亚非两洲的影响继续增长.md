Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 23rd: Democratic youth in colonies and dependent countries in Asia and Africa, under the leadership of the World Federation of Democratic Youth, are waging a heroic and unyielding struggle against the colonial system. According to TASS, the chairman of the "Youth Anti-Colonial System Bureau" of the World Federation of Democratic Youth, Ranjit Geva, wrote on the 20th that since the establishment of the World Federation of Democratic Youth, youth from colonies and dependent countries have actively participated in its work despite terror and persecution. In colonial countries, democratic youth organizations are suppressed for participating in national liberation movements. In Burma, Kuomintang China, Egypt, South India, Indonesia, Iraq, South Korea, and Malaya, nine youth organizations with a total of 4.5 million members have been declared illegal. Youth leaders in colonies and dependent countries have suffered brutal persecution for participating in the work of the Federation. For example, a reward of 15,000 pounds was offered for the assassination of Li Sun (transliteration), a member of the Executive Committee of the World Federation of Democratic Youth and a youth representative from Malaya, forcing him to flee from Singapore to the jungle. Kemal, a member of the Executive Committee of the World Federation of Democratic Youth and a youth leader from Egypt, was arrested by the police and thrown into a concentration camp without trial. Geva pointed out that despite this, the influence of the World Federation of Democratic Youth continues to expand in colonies and dependent countries. In the past three years, the number of youth organizations in colonial countries affiliated with the Federation has more than doubled, and the total number of people has increased by more than two times, reaching 10 million. The Southeast Asian Youth Conference was convened under the initiative of the Federation and the World Student Federation. This was the first time in the history of colonies and dependent countries. In the past two years, international youth delegations organized by the World Federation of Democratic Youth and the International Student Union have visited approximately fifteen colonies and dependent countries in Southeast Asia, North Africa, and the Middle East. The Federation competently undertook the task of uniting youth around the world to defend peace. Canadian youth have prevented ships carrying Canadian arms that would bring death to democratic China from departing; Australian young workers have refused to serve Dutch arms ships heading to Indonesia; British workers have launched a movement to protest the colonial war in Malaya; and French youth have also launched a movement against the invasion of Vietnam.

　　反对帝国主义的迫害与压榨
  　殖民地青年展开英勇斗争
    世界青联在亚非两洲的影响继续增长
    【新华社陕北二十三日电】亚非两洲殖民地和附属国家的民主青年，在世界民主青年联盟的领导下，正为反对殖民地制度进行英勇不屈的斗争。据塔斯社讯：世界民主青年联盟所属的“青年反殖民地制度局”主席朗吉特·格瓦，于二十日著文称：从世界青联创立的时候起，殖民地和附属国的青年，就不顾恐怖和迫害，积极参加它的工作。在殖民地国家，民主青年团体因为参加民族解放运动，而受到镇压。在缅甸、国民党中国、埃及、南印度、印尼、伊拉克、南朝鲜及马来亚，一共拥有四百五十万成员的九个青年团体，已被宣布为非法。殖民地及附属国的青年领袖们，因参加联盟的工作而遭受残酷的迫害。例如，为要杀害世界青联执行委员会委员、马来亚青年代表李荪（译音），曾被悬赏一万五千镑，他不得不因此从新加坡避至丛林中。世界青联执行委员会委员、埃及青年领袖基马尔，竟遭警察拘捕，未经审判就被投入集中营。格瓦指出：尽管如此，世界青联在殖民地和附属国家的影响，仍然在继续扩大。三年以来，联盟所属的殖民地国家青年团体的数目，已增加了一倍以上，总人数已增加了两倍，现达一千万人。在联盟和世界学联的发起之下，曾召开了东南亚青年大会。这在殖民地及附属国家的历史上还是第一次。两年来，世界青联及国际学联所组织的国际青年代表团，曾访问了东南亚、北非及中东约十五个殖民地及附属国。联盟胜任地担负了团结全世界青年保卫和平的任务。加拿大青年曾阻止那些将死亡带给民主中国的运输加拿大军火的船只出发；澳大利亚的青年工人拒绝为开向印尼的荷兰军火船只服务；英国工人发动抗议马来亚殖民战争的运动；法国青年也发动了反对侵略越南的运动。
