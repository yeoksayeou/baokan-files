    【新华社天津十二日电】天津全市三百九十四所公私立大、中、小学，在军事管制委员会领导和协助下，截至本月七日止，已有三百五十所先后复课。这些复课的学校，包括南开大学、北洋大学、河北省立工学院。河北省立女子师范学院、达仁学院、河北省立中学、天津市立中学、南开中学等五十余所公私立专科和中等以上的学校以及三百余所公私立小学。据不完全统计，到校学生已达十三万名，约占全市各校原有学生数百分之九十弱。河北省立医学院、私立津沽大学等校，也定于本月内陆续开学。在天津解放战役中，国民党匪军曾大肆破坏学校设备。著名全国的北洋大学矿物标本，矿物实验室，水利工程试验室和南开大学的经济研究所，则由于师生员工的尽力保护，现均完整无损，照常使用。
