Self-Criticism and Replies

To the Editors:

We should humbly accept the valuable opinion of Comrade Junsheng published in your newspaper's Criticism and Suggestions column on January 14 (titled "Why Doesn't Zhengtai Railway's Weishui Station Use Northwest Currency and Small Denomination Tickets?"), and we are very grateful for Comrade Junsheng's suggestion. The Weishui Station has conducted a self-criticism regarding this issue. At that time, when selling tickets for train numbers 561 and 562, an elderly woman purchased two tickets to Shijiazhuang, totaling 3,600 Jichaopiao. The fare paid consisted mostly of Northwest currency and small denomination Jichaopiao of one hundred yuan, which were also extremely tattered. Although the ticket seller requested her to exchange them in order to save everyone's ticket purchasing time, there was no refusal to accept the money. However, we should provide more care for women and children as much as possible, and emphasizing the exchange was inappropriate. We should pay attention to improving this point.

The railway construction of the past year has been carried out in an environment of repairing and operating at the same time. Also, due to many insufficient conditions, we have not been able to provide more extensive convenience for passengers and merchants. From this year onwards, we are prepared to strive towards regularization. Since January 21st, we have added a direct passenger train from Shijiazhuang to Yuci and added carriages. We are also preparing to improve the lighting equipment in the carriages to the best of our ability, step by step. We hope that everyone will provide more criticisms and suggestions in the future, as a mirror for us to improve our operations.

### 石家庄铁路管理局对照顾妇孺不够的检讨

专栏：检讨与答复

　　石家庄铁路管理局对照顾妇孺不够的检讨编辑同志：
    贵报一月十四日的批评与建议栏登载俊生同志对本路微水站的一段建议（标题“正太路微水车站为何不用西北币和零票”？）我们应当虚心的接受这个宝贵的意见，同时对俊生同志的提议十分感谢。微水站对这一问题，已进行了检讨，当时发售第五六一次车客票时，一老妇购用至石家庄车票二张，合冀钞三千六百元。所付票款多系西北币及百元冀钞等小额票，并极破烂，售票人员虽系为了节省大家的购票时间，请她换一换，并无拒绝收受事情。但对于妇孺应尽可能的多加一些照顾才是，强调更换是不对的，这一点我们应当注意改进。
    过去一年来的铁路建设是在一面修路一面营业的环境下进行的，同时因为许多条件不够，没有更广泛的照顾到客商的方便，从今年起我们准备争取向正轨方面迈进，自一月二十一日起，由石家庄至榆次，增开了一列直达旅客列车，并且加挂了车辆，车内的照明设备我们也准备尽最大的努力，逐步改善。今后还希望大家多提一些批评和建议，作为我们改善业务的借镜。
  　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　石家庄铁路管理局
