　　“February 7th” Memoirs
    ——Chang Shizi, Zheng Guoji, Liu Wanfen, Liu Demian, Workers Correspondence Group of the Zhengzhou Pinghan Railway Locomotive Depot
    Before and after the “February 7th” Incident, the Jinghan Railway (the Pinghan Railway was formerly known as the Jinghan Railway) was controlled by the Northern Warlord Wu Peifu. At that time, although workers at each station had their own labor union organizations, and there were close ties between them, they were still organizationally dispersed. Therefore, the workers urgently needed a general labor union organization.
    On August 10th, 1922, the "Preparatory Committee of the Jinghan General Labor Union" was established in Zhengzhou. It was decided to hold the official inaugural meeting of the "Jinghan Railway General Labor Union" in Zhengzhou on February 1st, 1923.
    At the end of January 1923, sixty-five representatives from various branches of the Jinghan Railway arrived in Zhengzhou, along with more than 130 guests. Wu Peifu, a direct-line warlord, secretly ordered the local garrison Jin Yun'e and others to forcibly prevent the meeting and obstruct it in every possible way. However, the workers resolutely decided to hold the meeting. On the morning of February 1st, representatives and guests, holding red flags, surrounded a large plaque with four golden characters "Labor is Sacred," and, led by a solemn military band, marched in formation to the venue. The streets were under emergency curfew, and armed police stood full of the streets. Only this iron column of the working class advanced in the tense atmosphere. When the procession passed Qiao's house on Datong Road and turned into Qiantang Lane, Huang Dianchen, the police chief of Zhengzhou and lackey of the warlords, led armed police to block the way, smashing the plaque and tearing the flags. But the representatives and guests finally broke through the encirclement, joined the Zhengzhou railway workers, and entered the Pule Theater, the meeting place. The military police followed closely and surrounded the venue again. The congress announced the official establishment of the "Jinghan Railway General Labor Union" amidst loud slogans of "Long Live Labor!", "Long Live the Jinghan Railway General Labor Union!", "Down with Imperialism!", and "Down with the Warlords!". The representatives held the meeting in a tense and激昂 atmosphere until 4:00 pm.
    The representatives returned to their hotels. The hotels, like the venue, were heavily surrounded by military police, and even food was not allowed to be sold to the representatives. The representatives lost their freedom, and the labor union was also occupied. Under the oppression and insults of the military police, the representatives stubbornly convened a secret meeting that evening, deciding to move the General Labor Union to Jiang'an (opposite Wuchang), and resolving that a general strike of all Jinghan Railway workers would begin at noon on February 4th. The representatives demanded: punish the murderers, compensate for the losses, have one week off for the Lunar New Year, paid weekly rest, and other demands.
    The next day, the representatives took trains back to their respective locations. At twelve noon on February 4th, an unprecedented large-scale strike in China broke out. The entire Jinghan Railway traffic was paralyzed. Locomotives stopped at whatever station they reached, and the water valves of the locomotives were completely removed and hidden. This action quickly received a response from the workers of several important railways.
    The iron fist of the working class struck heavily on the heads of the warlords. Enticements and threats could not stop the angry tide of the working class against oppression and exploitation. Thus, the hideous face of the warlords appeared, attempting to use slaughter to frighten this newborn force—the Chinese working class.
    On February 7th, Xiao Yaonan, the military governor of Hubei, ordered his chief of staff, Zhang Housheng, to lead two battalions of troops across the Yangtze River from Wuchang to Jiang'an, initially under the guise of negotiations, preparing to wipe out the labor union leaders in one fell swoop. At 5:00 pm, just as the representatives were preparing to go to the labor union, Xiao Yaonan's subordinates opened fire on the workers' picket line guarding the front of the labor union. Led by Captain Zeng Yuliang, the picket team rushed forward and seized seven rifles with their bare hands, bravely fighting back. But due to the enemy's numerical superiority, Zeng Yuliang and thirty-one others died heroically on the spot, and hundreds of workers were wounded. The workers guarded the labor union, holding out against the military police for dozens of minutes, until the General Labor Union ordered a retreat. Then, the military police began searching the workers. Fujian Street, where the labor union was located, was looted three times in one night. Lin Xiangqian, the chairman of the Jiang'an branch executive committee, was also among the large number of arrested workers. Zhang Housheng forced Comrade Lin to issue a resumption order, but Lin refused. Zhang Housheng then ordered Lin to be slashed once and asked, "Will you resume work?" Comrade Lin resolutely said, "No!" He then ordered another slash and asked, "Will you issue a resumption order?" Comrade Lin declared sternly, "My body can be broken, my head can be cut off, but I will never issue a resumption order!" The cruel warlords finally ordered Lin's head to be cut off, and the bloody man fell down.
    In Zhengzhou, after the workers went on strike on February 4th, although the whistle still blew every morning, not a single worker arrived at the station. On the 6th, the garrison headquarters arrested the labor union leaders Gao Bin, Jiang Haishi, and Qian Rengui, tied them up at the station, and kept them tied up for three days and three nights in the biting north wind. On the one hand, they tried to force the labor union to issue a resumption order, and on the other hand, they tried to forcibly seize the workers. The workers had all dispersed, leaving only their wives and children at home. After the "February 7th" massacre, Huang Dianchen used this news to intimidate the workers, and painted the words "Jinghan Worker" in white lime on the doors of the workers' homes, ordering the street chiefs to ring gongs, forcing the workers to return to work. Otherwise, they would be expelled from the city. He also sent people to monitor the workers' movements, ordering that no one could sell anything to the workers on credit, and even well water was not allowed for the workers to drink. At the same time, some deputy foremen (special agents) in military uniforms and carrying pistols were sent from Baoding to sabotage. At that time, when the enemy was still temporarily strong, the Jinghan Railway General Labor Union, in order to change the mode of struggle, painfully issued a resumption order, and all the workers resumed work with extremely grief-stricken feelings.
    Lin Xiangqian, the leader of the workers and a Communist Party member, died heroically, and some of his close comrades-in-arms were persecuted. Although the strike ended temporarily, the struggle did not end. Slowdowns, sabotage of machine parts, bombings, burning bridges... actions rose one after another, continuing until the Great Revolution - another even greater storm arrived.

　　“二七”回忆录
    ——郑州平汉铁路机务段工人通讯小组常师子、郑国辑、刘万芬、刘德冕
    “二七”发生前后，京汉路（平汉路过去称京汉路）掌握在北洋军阀吴佩孚手中。当时，各站工人虽都有了工会组织，彼此也有着密切的联系，但是，在组织上还是分散的，因此工人们迫切的需要一个总工会的组织。
    十一年八月十日，“京汉总工会筹委会”在郑州成立，决定于民国十二年二月一日在郑州开“京汉铁路总工会”的正式成立大会。
    十二年一月底，京汉路各分会代表六十五人到达郑州，并有来宾一百三十余人。直系军阀吴佩孚密令该地驻军靳云鹗等武力制止开会，并多方予以阻挠。但工人仍坚决举行大会。二月一日的早晨，代表、来宾拿着红旗，簇拥着“劳工神圣”四个金字的大匾，由庄严的军乐队领路，整队开赴会场。街上紧急戒严了，荷枪的军警站了满街，行人绝迹只有这支工人阶级的铁的行列在紧张气氛中前进。当队伍经过大同路乔家门转入钱塘里时，军阀的走狗郑州市的警察局长黄殿辰率领着武装警察，拦住了去路，把匾打碎了，把旗子撕了，但是代表们来宾们终于冲破了包围，与郑州铁路工人会合，进入会场普乐剧园。军警尾随着又把会场包围了。大会在响亮的“劳工万岁！”“京汉铁路总工会万岁！”“打倒帝国主义！”“打倒军阀！”等口号声中宣布了“京汉铁路总工会正式成立”。代表们在紧张、激昂的气氛中开会，直到下午四点钟才结束。
    代表们回到旅馆。旅馆也象会场一样被军警重重包围着，连饭也不许卖给代表们吃。代表们失去了自由，工会也被占了。在军警的压迫与侮辱之下，代表们仍顽强地在当日晚间召开了秘密会议，决定将总工会迁往江岸（武昌对岸），并决议自二月四日午时开始京汉路全体总同盟罢工。代表们要求：惩办凶手，赔偿损失，阴历年放假一星期，每星期休息照发工资等多项要求。
    次日，各代表乘车各回原地。四日中午十二时，中国空前规模的一次罢工爆发了，整个京汉铁路交通停顿了，机车到达哪站就停在哪站，机车的水门完全被卸掉，隐藏起来。这一行动，很快得到了几条重要铁路工人的响应。
    工人阶级的铁拳重重打击在军阀的头上。利诱、威胁都不能阻击住工人阶级反对压迫与剥削的怒潮。于是，军阀的狰狞面貌出现了，企图用屠杀来吓倒这新生的力量——中国工人阶级。
    二月七日，湖北督军萧耀南命令他的参谋长张厚生，率领两营军队由武昌渡江至江岸，先以商谈为名，准备将工会负责人一网打尽。下午五时，当代表正准备到工会去时，萧耀南的部下即对守候在工会门前的工人纠察队开枪了。纠察队在队长曾玉良率领下一拥而上，空手夺得步枪七枝，英勇地给以反击，终因敌众我寡，曾玉良等三十二个人当场英勇牺牲了，几百个工人被打伤了，工人们把守住了工会，与军警相持数十分钟，直到总工会下令退却。接着，军警对工人开始了搜查，工会所在地福建街一夜被接连洗劫三次。被大批逮捕的工人都被绑在车站电杆上，江岸分会执行委员长林祥谦同志亦在内。张厚生迫令林同志下复工令，林不答应，张厚生就下令把林同志砍一刀，问：“上工不上？”林同志坚决的说：“不上！”又下令再砍一刀，问：“下不下上工令？”林同志历声地说：“身可折，头可断，决不下上工令！”残酷的军阀最后下令将林的头砍下，血淋淋的人倒下去了。
    在郑州，自二月四日工人罢工以后，虽然每天早晨汽笛还叫，但到站的工人却一个也没有。六日，警备司令部把工会的负责人高斌、江海世、钱仁贵捕去，绑在车站上，在刺骨的北风里，绑了三天三夜。一面想强迫工会下上工令，一面强抓工人。工人都疏散了，家里只留下老婆小孩子。“二七”惨案发生后，黄殿辰就用这些消息威吓工人，并在工人住家的门前都用白灰涂上“京汉工人”的记号，命街长鸣锣，迫令工人上工，否则，就驱逐出城。又派人监视工人行动，命令任何人不能赊卖给工人东西，连井水也不让工人吃。同时，又在保定派来一些穿着军衣、带着手枪的副班（特务）来破坏。当时在敌人还暂时是强大的情况下，京汉路总工会为了改变斗争方式，忍痛地下了复工令，全体工人在悲愤万状的心情下复了工。
    工人的领袖共产党员林祥谦是英勇的牺牲了，他的亲密的战友有的被害了。罢工虽然暂时地结束了，但斗争却没有终止，怠工、破坏机件、炸车、烧桥，……此伏彼起地行动着，一直延续到大革命——另一个更大的大风暴的到来。
