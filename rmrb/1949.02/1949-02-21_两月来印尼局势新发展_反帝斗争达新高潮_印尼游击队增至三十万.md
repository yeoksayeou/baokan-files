　　New Developments in the Indonesian Situation in the Past Two Months
  　Anti-Imperialist Struggle Reaches New Climax
    Indonesian Guerrillas Increase to 300,000
    [Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 19th] Since December 19th of last year, when Dutch imperialism, with the connivance of the United States, launched a new war of aggression against Indonesia, two months have passed. During these two months, the anti-communist and anti-people ruling apparatus of the Indonesian Republic, headed by Sukarno and Hatta, has completely collapsed. However, the Indonesian people's armed struggle against imperialism has reached a new climax. As early as the beginning of January, the Indonesian anti-imperialist armed forces ended the chaotic situation caused by the retreat of the Hatta army and launched a guerrilla war against the invaders. As of late January, the strength of the guerrillas had increased to 300,000 due to the participation of workers, peasants, and resistance elements from the Republican army. They isolated 130,000 Dutch troops in various urban strongholds. The guerrillas not only began to recover the territory sold out by the Hatta government under the Renville Agreement on the islands of Java and Sumatra, but also conducted operations in the rear of the Dutch army on the islands of Borneo and Madura.
    In early February, after receiving reinforcements from their home country, the Dutch army launched "sweeping" operations against the guerrillas in Central and East Java; currently, they have shifted the focus of the "sweeping" operations to West Java. However, the Indonesian guerrillas launched a diversionary offensive in West Java in early February, and recently recovered many positions in East Java, inflicting an average of 200 casualties on the Dutch army daily.
    The development of the Indonesian war situation was completely beyond the expectations of the imperialist countries. The United Nations Indonesia "Conciliation" Committee repeatedly submitted reports in the second half of January, and had to admit that the Netherlands was unable to restore the imperialist ruling "order" by force. Under these circumstances, the American reactionaries, on January 28, forced the Security Council, which they control, to pass a new reactionary resolution, plotting to use Hatta and others, who were captured by the Netherlands, to divide the guerrillas in order to end the Indonesian anti-imperialist guerrilla war and allow American monopoly capitalists to freely plunder Indonesia's resources. On February 9, Hatta, through the Indonesian representative of the Indonesian Committee, Rom, expressed to the US side that he was happy to serve.
    However, when American imperialism began to implement its new conspiracy plan, it not only encountered resistance from the Indonesian people and condemnation from world democratic public opinion, but also encountered resistance from some Dutch reactionaries, because the latter "were extremely alarmed by the American's move to replace their position in Indonesia" (De Waarheid newspaper commentary). Therefore, the Dutch reactionaries sent a "secret proposal" to Hatta and others in early February, attempting to use some so-called concessions to make Hatta act as a Dutch puppet. At the same time, Sukarno was released by the Dutch from Bangka Island near Medan, to discuss the issue of forming a "federal government" with Hatta, who was detained there, and the "federal elements" (Dutch puppets). The behavior of the Netherlands aroused the dissatisfaction of American expansionists. On February 8, the Indonesian Committee, under the command of the American representative Cochran, demanded that the Dutch government provide information on the "secret proposal"; on the 12th, the Indonesian Committee flew directly from Batavia to Bangka Island in the name of visiting Hatta, preventing the negotiations between the "federal elements" controlled by the Netherlands and Hatta and others.

　　两月来印尼局势新发展
  　反帝斗争达新高潮
    印尼游击队增至三十万
    【新华社陕北十九日电】自去年十二月十九日，荷兰帝国主义在美国纵容下发动侵占印尼的新战争以来，至今已两个月。在这两个月期间，以苏加诺、哈达为首的印尼共和国反共反人民的统治机构，是根本崩溃了，但印尼人民反帝国主义的武装斗争，却已达到新的高潮。早在一月上旬，印尼反帝武装便结束了由于哈达军队的溃逃而造成的混乱局面，对侵略者展开了游击战争。截至一月下旬，游击队由于得到工农和共和军抗战分子的参加，实力已增至三十万。他们使十三万荷军孤立于各城市据点。游击队不仅在爪哇、苏门答腊两岛上，开始恢复被哈达政府根据伦维尔协定出卖的国土，而且婆罗洲、马都拉二岛的荷军后方进行作战。
    本月上旬，荷军自本国得到增援后，在中爪哇和东爪哇对游击队举行“扫荡”；目前又把“扫荡”重点移向西爪哇。但是，印尼游击队则于上旬在西爪哇发动牵制进攻，最近又收复东爪哇的许多阵地，平均每日予荷军二百名的杀伤。
    印尼战局的发展，完全出乎帝国主义国家意料之外。联合国印尼“调处”委员会于一月下半月一再提出报告，也不得不承认荷兰已无法以武力恢复帝国主义的统治“秩序”。在这种情况之下，美国反动派于一月二十八日强使其控制下的安理会通过一项新的反动决议，阴谋利用被荷兰俘虏的哈达等出来分化游击队，以便结束印尼的反帝游击战争，并使美国垄断资本家得以放手掠夺印尼的资源。哈达于二月九日经由印尼委员会印尼代表洛姆向美方表示乐于效劳。
    但是，美帝国主义在开始执行其新的阴谋计划时，不仅受到印尼人民的抵抗及世界民主舆论的谴责，还遇到荷兰一部分反动派的抗拒，因为后者“对于美国开始在印尼取代他们的地位一举极为惊恐”（德·瓦尔海报评论）。因此，荷兰反动派曾于本月初旬以“秘密建议”一件送致啥达等，企图以一些所谓让步，使哈达充当荷兰傀儡。同时，苏加诺被荷方从棉兰附近解放邦加岛，以与被禁于当地的哈达共同与“联邦分子”（荷兰傀儡）谈判组织“联邦政府”的问题。荷兰的行为引起了美国扩张主义者的不满。二月八日，在美国代表柯契伦指挥下的印尼委员会，要求荷政府提供关于“秘密建议”的情报；十二日，印尼委员会以访问哈达的名义，自巴达维亚径飞邦加岛，阻止了荷兰操纵下的“联邦分子”与哈达等的谈判。
