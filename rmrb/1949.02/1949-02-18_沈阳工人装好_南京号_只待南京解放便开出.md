  　Ready to Depart Once Nanjing is Liberated
    【Xinhua News Agency, Shenyang, 16th】Following the decoration of the "Beiping" and "Tianjin" locomotives to celebrate the liberation of Peiping and Tianjin, Shenyang railway workers have now decorated another locomotive named the "Nanjing" and are rushing to repair another locomotive named the "East China." The "Nanjing" locomotive held its completion ceremony on the 28th of last month, and is very exquisitely decorated, ready to depart once Nanjing is liberated and the railway is repaired. The "East China" is a locomotive being rushed to repair by workers at the Shenyang Railway Vehicle Manufacturing Plant, and is intended as a gift to the railway workers of the East China Liberated Area. It has now been mostly repaired and will be leaving the factory soon.
