　　I’ve Found My Way!
　　——A Record of Old Worker Fang Buyin
　　Guo Yuan
　　　　(I)
　　Old worker Fang Buyin is sixty years old this year and has been working as a carpenter for more than forty years, with twenty-six years of history in the factory. He is one of the oldest workers in the Shijiazhuang Prosperity Yarn Factory. He was there when the large factory was first built and is still working in the First Branch Factory.
　　Fang, in his youth, lost his father at sixteen and his mother at seventeen. He left his hometown—originally Ji County—and traveled far to Fuping in the mountains, where he began as an apprentice carpenter under a master. There, he started work before dawn and finished late at night, working diligently for five years before returning home. But his house and land had been sold, leaving him without support or a foothold. Hearing that fellow villagers were contracting at the Lincheng Coal Mine, he went to join them. He worked as a contractor there for three years, without saving any money. Returning home for the New Year, he went to a distant uncle in Zanhuang who was doing odd jobs, and he stayed there for eight years. In the great famine of the ninth year of the Republic of China, the land was barren for miles, not a blade of grass grew, and people could not even save themselves from death, so there was no carpentry work to be done. With no other choice, he fled to Shijiazhuang.
　　In the eleventh year of the Republic of China, when the yarn factory was established, he came to work there. He participated in the construction of the reeling and spinning workshops of the main factory. Initially, he nailed concrete molds. When the factory officially started operations in August, he became a "worker in the factory," working in the carpentry shop for five years. After the cloth factory was built, he was transferred to the cloth factory to repair shuttles. He also participated in the major strike at the yarn factory in the fourteenth year of the Republic of China. When the July 7th Incident occurred and the Japanese came, he could not stand it and resolutely quit. Initially, the Japanese would not let him leave, but later, others helped him by saying many "good words," and they finally released him. From then on, he carried his furniture out and started doing odd jobs on the streets. Many buildings on Zhongshan Road in Shijiazhuang and the Huayuan Hotel on Xinhua Road West were built with beams he had erected himself, but he lived in a shack in the slums near Nanma Road. Apart from getting married at the age of thirty-three and having a family of six (wife, daughter-in-law, grandson, and granddaughter), he had no other possessions.
　　After the Japanese surrender, someone found him and he went back to work at the yarn factory, working there until liberation.
　　　　(II)
　　After the liberation of Shijiazhuang, the democratic government called on workers to resume work, and he went back to work. Because his hometown had been liberated earlier, and he had also been to Zanhuang during the famine in the twenty-first year of the Republic of China, he had seen the Eighth Route Army and understood the Communist Party. Although it was only after liberation, he was not as afraid as others, so he worked steadily as soon as he started. However, enemy planes were constantly bombing. To protect the factory and the safety of the workers, the factory dispersed the machines to the outside. Fang, although old, still followed a hundred and dozens of people with more than twenty large vehicles, dismantling machines—lifting iron plates and carrying machine parts. The young people were exhausted, but he did not complain about being tired and persisted to the end, eventually moving the machines to a new location.
　　In order to start work as soon as possible, the workers began to install the machines in the new location. Seventeen or eighteen people installed dozens of vehicles, working day and night continuously. Fang planed shuttle boxes both well and quickly, and one person could supply several people for vehicle installation.
　　After work began, he still didn't rest his hands, often running around to find work to do on his own initiative. He made the hammer leather supports, springs, large connecting rods, and repaired warp beams on the cloth machines all by himself. He prepared these things in advance, and when he saw that something needed repair, he would take the initiative to repair it. When he saw that something needed replacing, he would take the initiative to replace it, never needing to be called or urged.
　　Especially during the period before and after the war preparations in late October last year, he showed even more enthusiasm. At that time, the situation was very tense, there were many rumors, and enemy planes were constantly attacking. The factory had to fortify important machines to avoid enemy destruction, and the air conditioning units were so heavy, but despite his age, he still took the lead in the work. Some people, not seeing clearly, were still afraid of the powerful weapons the United States would provide the Kuomintang reactionaries, but Fang knew very well, and said angrily, "It's no use just talking about how powerful the enemy's weapons are, even a ‘loose person’ can't kill anyone with a goose feather knife!"
　　After the machines at the branch factory were almost dispersed and fortified, they went to help the main factory move machines. At that time, someone asked him:
　　"Old man, are you still going?"
　　He said: "Why wouldn't I go? I'm still leading you to work!"
　　That day, enemy planes were constantly circling and bombing, and others slipped away, but he was still there nailing.
　　Usually, if he saw people doing work incorrectly, he would criticize:
　　"These things are ours, we must do a good job, and not let the enemy come and destroy them!"
　　Back at the branch factory, seeing that everyone was very nervous, he took the initiative to ask to drive the carts.
　　During the demobilization period after the war preparations, he was still at the forefront, never lagging behind, moving the machines back. He was so old, but when he worked, he didn't look like someone getting on in years, he was just like a young lad.
　　In July last year, the branch factory rated him as a model worker. At the commendation and awards conference after the war preparations, he won an award again. The workers saw that he was good, and when the branch trade union was re-elected, they nominated him as vice chairman. After the general branch disclosed the party last year, old Fang resolutely said: "As long as the Communist Party doesn't dislike me for being old, I am determined to join the Communist Party and follow the Communist Party!" On January 4th of this year, the general branch officially accepted this old worker's request to join the party and approved his admission.
　　　　(III)
　　He has been in the factory for more than twenty years, and is honest and kind, and very amiable to others. Some old workmates have been with him for more than twenty years and have never seen him lose his temper with his fellow workers. He does his best to do what others ask of him, happily, and never refuses. He loves sincerely, and in the past could only suppress the resentment and silence in his heart towards the capitalists.
　　After liberation, his understanding became clearer, and he was also willing to speak up and dared to criticize boldly. His attitude towards the factory was also different. Initially, materials were scarce and difficult to purchase, and he understood this very well. Therefore, he was very economical with materials, never wasting or spoiling the public's property. He often saved old or broken shuttles, repaired them, and brought them out to use again.
　　Now he also does carpentry work in the branch factory. He is familiar with everything. In addition to repairing shuttles, he finds work to do and can do it well. He regards the factory as his own home. Seeing his family's business develop day by day, he works even harder, and the old man is even more energetic. He said:
　　"Since liberation, my body has become much stronger than before, my eyes are not blurry, my ears are not deaf, and I have more energy. I like to work like this, and I can never finish the work."
　　Why is this so? He answered it well himself: "In the past, working for the Kuomintang and Japanese, all my blood and sweat were exploited by them, and in the end, I was still starving and freezing. I have participated in several war preparations. In the early years of the 'Zhili-Fengtian War,' the factory was closed for half a year, and the factory owners abandoned the workers and ran away. During the July 7th Incident, when the Japanese came, the Kuomintang also abandoned the workers and slipped away, leaving a few people to look after the factory, who also welcomed the Japanese and handed over the factory to them completely. They didn't care about the workers' lives. The Communist Party and the Liberation Army are different. As soon as the war preparations started, they told everyone the real news, so that everyone could be prepared, and they also pre-paid the workers' wages, and tried to solve any difficulties the workers had. They treat the workers as their own people, and the workers treat the factory as their own home. I have been working in the factory for more than twenty years and have been a carpenter for forty years. I was confused in the past, but now I have found my way!"

　　我摸着路了！
    ——记老工人方步印
    郭远
    　　　　（一）
    老工人方步印今年六十岁了，已经干了四十多年的木匠活，在工厂也有二十六年的历史了。他是石家庄繁荣纱厂最老工人当中的一个，大厂一开始建立，就有他，直到现在，还在第一分厂工作。
    方老头自从他十六岁上死了父亲，十七岁上又丧了母亲，他便离开家乡——原籍冀县，远奔阜平，在山里开始跟师傅学徒、当木匠，在那里起五更睡半夜，苦心干了五年，才回了家。可是家里房子地都卖了，无依无靠，无法站脚；听说乡亲们在临城煤矿上包工，他便投奔了去。在矿上干起包工活来，在那里干了三年，没落下什么钱，过年回家，有一个堂叔伯在赞皇做散活，他又投奔了去，一直干了八年，赶上民国九年大歉年，赤地千里，寸草不生，人们救死不得，那里还有木匠活干呢？没有法子，他才逃到石家庄来。
    民国十一年纱厂成立，他便来纱厂作工，总厂的摇纱间细纱间的建筑，他都参加了，最初他钉洋灰模子，八月纱厂正式开工，他便归了“里工”，在木匠房干了五年，布厂建立后，他又调到布厂专修理梭子，民国十四年纱厂大罢工，他也参加了。七七事变，日本来了，他受不住那个气，坚决不干了。最初日本人不让他走，后来，旁人帮他说了许多“好话”，才把他放了。从此，他便把自己的家具背出来，开始在街面上干散活，石家庄中山路上的好些楼房与新华路西的花园饭店，他都亲手架过栋梁，但他住的却是南马路附近贫民窟里一间席棚。除了三十三岁上结了婚家有六口人（妻子、儿媳、孙儿孙女。）外，别无产业。
    日本投降后，有人找他又上了纱厂，直干到解放。
    　　　　（二）
    石家庄解放后，民主政府号召工人复工，他就上班了。因为他的老家早解放了，民国二十一年闹灾荒，他又去过赞皇，回到老家，见过八路军，了解共产党，虽说才解放他却不象旁人那样怕，所以他一上了班，就踏踏实实的干起来。可是敌人的飞机，却不断的轰炸，厂方为了保护工厂，和工人的安全，便向外疏散机器，方老头，虽然年迈，但依然跟着一百几十号人，二十多辆大车、拆卸机器——抬铁板，扛机件，青年人都累乏了，可是他并没有嚷自己累，一直坚持到最后，结果，把机器转移到新的地方。
    为了早日开工，职工们便开始在新的地方按装机器，十七、八个人，装几十台车，白天，黑夜连着的前赶，方老头平梭箱平的又好又快，一个人能供好几个人装车用。
    开了工，他还是手不闲，经常到处跑，自动的找活干，布机上的榔头皮托、蹦簧、交大棍、修经轴全由他一个人做，他事先把这样的东西准备好，看见那里该修理了，就主动的修理，看见那里该换就主动的去换，从不让人唤、让人催。
    尤其是在去年十月底备战前后，他表现的更积极。当时的情况，非常紧张，谣言很多，敌人的飞机又不断的袭击，厂方要把重要的机器坚壁，避免敌人的破坏，冷气机又那样笨重，他虽然年老，仍是带着头的干。有些人，看不清，还害怕美国帮助国民党反动派武器厉害，但方老头认识的很清楚，气愤的说：“光说敌人家伙带劲，不知道‘松人’拿着雁翎刀也杀不死人！”
    分厂的机器疏散坚壁的差不多了，便去帮助总厂搬运机器，当时有人问他：
    “老头，你还去吗？”
    他说：“怎么不去，我还领着你们干哩！”
    那天，敌人的飞机，不断的盘旋轰炸，旁的人溜了边，他还在那里钉着。
    平时他看人干活不对就批评：
    “这些东西是咱们的，咱们要好生干，不让敌人来了给破坏了！”
    回到分厂，他看见大家很紧张，又自动去要求去赶车。
    备战回来，复员时期，往回搬运机器，他还是干在前头，从不落后，他那么大年纪，干起活来，并不象上了年岁的人，活象一个年青的小伙子。
    去年七月，分厂评定他为模范工，备战后评功给奖大会上，他又得了奖，工人看他好，分工会改选时，推选他为副主任，去年自总支公开党以后，老方坚决的说：“只要共产党不嫌我老，我决心参加共产党，跟着共产党走！”今年一月四日总支正式接受这位老工人入党的请求，批准入党。
    　　　　（三）
    他在工厂二十多年，为人忠厚老实，待人非常和蔼，有些老工友和他在一起二十多年，从来没有见过他和自己工人兄弟发过脾气，旁人要求他的事，只要他办得到，他就尽心的办，欢喜的干，从不推辞。他热爱真诚，在过去对资本家只能压抑着自己的内心的愤恨、不言语。
    解放后，他认识的更清楚了，他也愿意讲话了，敢大胆的批评了，对工厂态度也不同了，最初材料很缺乏，添购不易，他很了解这一点，对于物料，就非常节省，从不浪费糟蹋公家的一点东西，他常把旧的梭子或坏了的，都保存起来修理好，又拿出来，照样的用。
    现在分厂里木工活，他也作，他一切都很熟悉，除了修梭以外，什么活都找着干，而且都能做好，他把工厂看成自己的家了，他看着自己家的事业，一天天的发展，他干的更加有劲，老头子更加有精神了。他说：
    “自从解放以来，我的身体倒比从前壮实的多了，眼不花，耳也不聋，劲头更大了，我喜欢这样干，活儿总干不清。”
    为什么会这样呢？他自己解答的很好：“过去给国民党日本人干活，一身血汗被他们剥削尽了，到老还是落个挨饿受冻。我曾参加过几次备战，早年‘直奉战争’，工厂停了半年，厂方扔下工人跑了；七七事变，日本人来了，国民党也把工人丢下，自己溜了，留下几个看厂的，也欢迎了日本人，把工厂全盘托给人家，他们不管工人的死活。共产党解放军就不同了，备战一开始，就把真实消息告给大家，让大家都有个准备，并且预借给工人工资，工人有什么困难，还设法解决。把工人当作自己的人，工人们把工厂当成自己的家。我参加二十多年的工厂干了四十年的木匠活，过去稀里糊涂，现在可摸着路了！”
