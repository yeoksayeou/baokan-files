　　A Certain Electric Company Studies "Carry the Revolution Through to the End"
    △Since the Learning Committee of ×× Electric Company stipulated the study of "Carry the Revolution Through to the End" and Chairman Mao's statement on the current situation, Groups A and B have adopted different methods for learning (Group A studies independently, Group B attends classes). Everyone's understanding has improved a step further. For example, worker Qin Bingshan said: "Right, we must carry the revolution through to the end." On the test paper, worker Meng Guanchao wrote: "There must be Chairman Mao's eight proposals for true peace." After this test, everyone has a new understanding of the current situation, and their attitude towards learning is also more serious. The Learning Committee has stipulated that the next phase of study will be the history of social development. Now everyone is buying books and notebooks, eagerly preparing to welcome the new learning task.

　　某电灯公司学习“将革命进行到底”
    △××电灯公司学委会自规定学习“将革命进行到底”及毛主席对时局的声明后，甲乙两组采取了不同方式进行学习（甲组自学，乙组上课）。大家在认识上都提高了一步，如工友秦丙山说：“对，一定得革命到底。”在测验的卷子上，工友孟观潮写着：“一定要有毛主席的八条主张，才是真正的和平。”经过这次测验，大家对时局有了新的认识，并且对学习态度也比较认真了。学委会规定了下期学习社会发展史，现在大家都在买书，买笔记本，热烈的准备着迎接新的学习任务。
