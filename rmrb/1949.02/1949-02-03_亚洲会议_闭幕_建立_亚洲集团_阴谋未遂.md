　　"Asian Conference" Concludes
  　Conspiracy to Establish "Asian Bloc" Foiled
    Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 29th—The New Delhi "Asian Conference," which attempted to establish an anti-people Asian bloc, concluded on the 23rd after three days of open and "secret" discussions.

    Due to the conflicting interests among the ruling groups of the participating countries, the central aim of the conference—establishing an "Asian Bloc"—was not agreed upon. The third resolution passed by the conference on the 23rd, regarding the Asian Bloc issue, vaguely stipulated that "the governments of the participating countries should consult each other to seek ways and means of establishing appropriate institutions" (Indian Information Bureau). The main divisions during the conference occurred between India and the Muslim countries headed by Pakistan, the latter viewing India as a newly emerging "imperialism," a fearful sentiment that "cast a shadow over the Asian Conference" (Agence France-Presse). On the Indian side, there were concerns that the Muslim countries, whose "policies and ideas" were "far removed" from those of the Indian ruling group, would be "concerned with establishing a powerful Muslim bloc." In addition, the Australian ruling group's "White Australia policy" (a Greater Australia doctrine that excluded people of color) aroused "sensitivity" among some so-called Indian figures (Associated Press).

    On the 23rd, the conference also passed two resolutions on the Indonesian issue. Although Nehru had declared that the Asian Conference would support Indonesia, it actually helped the Netherlands oppose the Indonesian people. The first resolution, in the proposal submitted to the United Nations, did not demand the immediate withdrawal of Dutch troops from the occupied areas of Indonesia, but hypocritically requested that the date for the Dutch troop withdrawal be set for "March 15, 1949," and the date for the transfer of "sovereignty" to Indonesia be "January 1, 1950" (Agence France-Presse). This was entirely to help the Dutch aggressors gain time to organize a puppet federal government in order to complete their aggression plan. The second resolution stipulated that the governments of the participating countries should be advised to "exchange views at any time" with each other on the first issue (Indian Information Bureau).

### “亚洲会议”闭幕　建立“亚洲集团”阴谋未遂

　　“亚洲会议”闭幕
  　建立“亚洲集团”阴谋未遂
    【新华社陕北二十九日电】企图建立亚洲反人民集团的新德里“亚洲会议”，经过三天公开的与“秘密”的讨论后，已于二十三日闭幕。
    由于与会各国统治集团间利益的矛盾，对于会议的中心目的——建立“亚洲集团”一举，并未达成协议。该会议于二十三日所通过的第三项决议，即关于亚洲集团问题的决议中，仅含糊地规定“与会各国政府应相互磋商，以寻求关于成立适当机构之方式及办法”（印新闻处）。会议期间的主要分歧，发生在印度与以巴基斯坦为首的各回教国家之间，后者把印度视为新起的“帝国主义”，这种恐惧的心理，曾“使亚洲会议上浮起一片阴云”（法新社）。而印度方面人士则耽心在“政策与思想”上与印度统治集团“彼此相去甚远”的回教国家，将“关心于成立一个强大的回教集团”。此外，澳洲统治集团的“白澳政策”（排斥有色人种的大澳洲主义，曾引起若干所谓印度人士的“敏感”。（美联社）
    二十三日，会议还通过了两项对印尼问题的决议，尽管尼赫鲁曾扬言：亚洲会议将声援印尼，但实际上是帮助荷兰反对印尼人民的。决议的第一项，在向联合国提出的建议案中，并未要求荷军立即自印尼被侵占区撤退，却假惺惺地要求订荷军撤出的日期为“一九四九年三月十五日”；订“主权”移交印尼的日期为“一九五○年一月一日”（法新社）。这完全是帮助荷兰侵略者获取时间，组织傀儡联帮政府，以完成其侵略计划。决议的第二项规定：向与会各国政府建议，彼此就第一项问题，“随时交换意见”（印新闻处）。
