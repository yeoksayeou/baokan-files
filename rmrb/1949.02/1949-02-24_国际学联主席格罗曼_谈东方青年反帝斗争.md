  　IUS President Grohman
    Talks About the Anti-Imperialist Struggle of Eastern Youth
    [Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, February 22nd dispatch] Electronegative News Agency, Prague dispatch: On the eve of this year's February 22nd – the first World Colonial Youth Day, IUS President Grohman spoke on the 19th about the Eastern youth's struggle against imperialist colonial enslavement. He said: In Vietnam, where young people are heroically participating in the struggle against French colonialists, the people have controlled 95 percent of the country's territory. Vietnamese students have also reduced the country's illiteracy by half. Malayan youth are playing an active role in the struggle against the British army. Burmese youth stand at the forefront of the ranks engaged in the war of liberation. Youth are playing an active role in the people's struggle for independence in India, the Middle East, and elsewhere.
    Grohman stated: The whole world will commemorate "February 21st" Colonial Youth Day under the slogan "Struggle for national independence – which is also struggle for peace." Three years ago on this day, Indian sailors launched a mutiny against British oppression, and received the support of working youth and students. Three years ago on the same day, 20,000 Egyptian students marched and demonstrated, demanding Egypt's independence from Britain, and the police opened fire on the demonstrators. The Southeast Asian Youth Conference convened in Calcutta last February by the IUS and the World Federation of Democratic Youth had suggested declaring that day as Colonial Youth Day to commemorate the victims of colonial terror. This proposal has been adopted by the IUS Executive Committee held in Prague on January 18th.

　　“二、二一”世界殖民地青年日
  　国际学联主席格罗曼
    谈东方青年反帝斗争
    【新华社陕北二十二日电】电通社布拉格讯：在今年二月廿二日——第一个世界殖民地青年日的前夕，国际学联主席格罗曼于十九日畅谈东方青年反对帝国主义殖民地奴役的斗争。他说：在青年们英勇参加对法国殖民主义者斗争的越南，人民已控制了该国领土百分之九十五。越南的学生并已将该国的文盲减少了一半。马来亚青年在对英军的斗争中，正起着积极的作用。缅甸青年站在进行解放战争的行伍的最前列。青年在印度、中东及其他各地人民的独立斗争中皆起着积极作用。
    格罗曼称：全世界将在“为民族独立而斗争——亦即为和平而斗争”这一口号下纪念“二、二一”殖民地青年日。三年前的这一天，印度海员爆发了反对英国压迫的暴动，并获得劳动青年与学生的支持。三年前的同一天，埃及二万学生游行示威，要求埃及脱离英国而独立，警察对示威者开火。国际学联与世界民主青年联盟去年二月在加尔各答召开的东南亚各国青年会议，即曾建议宣布该日为殖民地青年日，以纪念殖民恐怖下的牺牲者。该建议已为一月十八日在布拉格召开的国际学联执委会所通过。
