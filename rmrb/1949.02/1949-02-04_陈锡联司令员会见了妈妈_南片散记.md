　　Commander Chen Xilian Meets His Mother
　　Southern Region Sketches
　　Du Hong, Zeng Ke
　　The troops transferred from western Anhui to Macheng, and were deploying military actions to coordinate with the Ping-Han Campaign.

　　On the morning of December 9th, in Xintianpu, the main room of a house being used as the headquarters was as tense and serious as usual. Chief of Staff Zhao’s hand never left the telephone headset. Suddenly, he exclaimed with delight and immediately called to Commander Chen:

　　“Quick, good news for you! Your brother was taken by the Sixth Column as a guide.”

　　Commander Chen glanced away from the map for a moment, laughed it off, and refocused his attention on the deployment planning with Deputy Political Commissar Yan.

　　After Chief of Staff Zhao finished listening to the call, he put down the headset, ran over, and pulled Commander Chen, saying:

　　“No, I’m not joking with you. Your mother is coming to see you today.”

　　At this point, the attention of the headquarters staff shifted to this sudden and delightful news. Chief of Staff Zhao told everyone what he had heard on the phone: Last night, while the Sixth Column was moving, they found a young man to be their guide. After leading them for a few stops, the young man asked to return home because he only had a 63-year-old mother at home and his older brother had joined the Red Army twenty years ago. The soldiers then asked him the name of his brother. When the young man said it was Chen Xilian, he was quickly brought to the headquarters...

　　That morning, a handcart stopped in front of the headquarters. The guards welcomed an old lady, dressed in a new blue outfit, who looked quite healthy, into the house.

　　The headquarters was full of people, all warmly welcoming this mother of a Red Army soldier.

　　Before Comrade Chen Xilian could come forward to recognize her, everyone surrounded the old lady. They shouted excitedly:

　　"Old lady, look, which one is your son?"

　　The old lady, surrounded by so many enthusiastic, cheerful, but unfamiliar people, did not appear the least bit timid because of her joy. She confidently said: I recognize him, I recognize him. While rotating her gaze and earnestly searching each person's face.

　　“Mother!” Comrade Chen Xilian couldn’t help but shout. The old lady's searching gaze immediately stopped. She rushed forward without hesitation, wrapped her arms tightly around her son, and kept saying:

　　“Yes! I recognize you, your appearance hasn't changed much...” Her voice was a little choked.

　　Everyone in the room was so moved that their noses felt a little sore.

　　The old lady rubbed her eyes and slowly calmed down. She squinted her eyes and carefully looked at her son from head to toe, and often used her hand to stroke his forehead. Comrade Chen Xilian asked his mother somewhat shyly:

　　"Have I changed?"

　　The mother repeatedly replied:

　　"You've just gotten a little fatter and taller..."

　　Comrade Chen Xilian asked his mother to sit down in a chair. The old lady grabbed her son's hand and just kept crying.

　　"Don't cry! There are so many people..." her son comforted her.

　　This old lady with a strong character immediately wiped away her tears and said:

　　"Okay, I won't cry."

　　The mother and son began to reminisce about their family. Comrade Chen Xilian said softly, in a reminiscent tone:

　　“It’s been nineteen years since we last met!”

　　"More than that! It's been a full twenty years!" the mother corrected him.

　　“I remember it was only nineteen years!”

　　"Twenty years, without a doubt." the mother stubbornly said. "These twenty years, I've been counting them year by year, enduring suffering every year, how could I misremember?"

　　Comrade Chen Xilian was silent. He quietly listened to his mother's tearful account of her persecuted and difficult life over the past twenty years. The old lady didn't stop talking all night. Shadows of past events revived once again in the old woman's memory. She remembered clearly that in 1930, in that earth-shattering era, Red Armies rose everywhere, Soviet governments were established, local tyrants were overthrown, land was distributed, the poor ruled the world, and her son also ended his days as a cattle herder, free from beatings, humiliation, and the misery of having nothing to eat or wear, and joined the Red Army. However, the following year, the happy days were snatched away by the Chiang Kai-shek bandit gang. Even the rice bowl that had been distributed was taken away. She knew that happy days would come again, and that would be when her son returned victorious with the Red Army. For twenty years, she had been waiting for her son with this unwavering belief, and today, her son had finally come before her again.

　　“So, how did you live after I left?” Comrade Chen Xilian asked.

　　"I begged for food, I lived like that for several years," the old lady said painfully. "At first, I couldn't get any news from you, and everyone said you were gone. The year before last, there were rumors of the Red Army in Guangshan and Huangchuan, and I begged for food to go look for you, and I almost died on the road..."

　　“This time, did you hear I was back?”

　　"Rumors started as soon as you crossed the Yellow River. Some said you had a big responsibility, some said you were leading a lot of troops, and I haven't slept for half a month. In October, I asked your brother to go to Huang'an to inquire, and all they said was that you were really back this time, but they didn't know where?" The old lady got more and more excited as she spoke, without showing any signs of fatigue. "Our house has also been lived in by our troops! I gave them all the good things to eat in the house."

　　Early the next morning, the room was crowded again. Even the nearby people came to see the happy reunion of the mother and son. Comrade Chen Xilian consciously began to talk to his mother about some pleasant things, in order to switch from the painful topics of the past day and night, and then send the old lady home with peace of mind. So, he took out a photo from his pocket and said:

　　“This is your daughter-in-law and little grandson, they will come home to see you in a few days.”

　　The old lady took the photo, moved her feet a few steps towards the door, and in the bright morning light, put the photo to her mouth, smiling so much that she couldn't close her mouth.

　　Comrade Chen Xilian gave his mother the blanket he was sleeping on and the quilt he was using. And he asked with a smile:

　　"What else do you need?"

　　This old woman, who had endured poverty and hardship for decades, began to experience happiness. However, this happiness was brought to her by the revolution. He said so openly: "What else do you need?"

　　"Seeing you, I don't need anything. Originally, I was so worried about not being able to buy a coffin board; now, I don't think about that, I just want to eliminate old Chiang and live a few more years."

　　The troops had an action that evening, and Comrade Chen Xilian planned to send his mother home in the afternoon. Huang'an was, after all, still a somewhat unstable new area. He remembered what his mother had said last night, that because of his revolution, two of his uncles had been brutally killed, so he considerately discussed with his mother:

　　“Let me take you to a safe place to live! Otherwise, if something happens, the bandits will come to harm you again!”

　　The old lady patted her chest and said very strongly:

　　"I'm not afraid, I only have this old life. See if they dare to do anything to me! In the past, when they came to look for me, I said to them: My son joined the Red Army in such and such year and month, if you want to arrest me, then arrest me! I was planning to die anyway. Now that you're back, let them come again! If they harm me, the villagers won't let them!"

　　After dinner, everyone in the headquarters sent the old lady out the door. She didn't show any signs of sadness, and kept saying:

　　"I know, the sooner we eliminate old Chiang, the sooner we can have reunion days!"

　　The small cart pushed the old lady, gradually moving away from us. We couldn't suppress our excited feelings and sang:

　　“We must fight for the motherland, to defend you! Dear Mother!…”

　　Immediately, we set off to attack the enemy…

　　陈锡联司令员会见了妈妈
  　南片散记
    杜宏　曾克
    部队从皖西转进到麻城，正在部署配合平汉战役的军事行动。
    十二月九日的清晨，在新田铺，一家做为司令部的堂间里，象平日一样紧张而严肃。电话耳机一直离不开赵参谋处长的手。忽然，他惊喜的叫了一声，并且立刻叫陈司令员说：
    “快来，你的好消息，你兄弟叫六纵队找去当向导了。”
    陈司令员把眼睛离开了地图一下，没有当成一回事情的笑了笑，又和阎副政委把注意力集中在部署的研究上去了。
    赵参谋处长听完了来话，把耳机放下，跑过去拉着陈司令员又说：
    “嗯，不是给你开玩笑，老太太今天就来看你了。”
    这时，司令部人们的注意力。才开始集中在这个突然得到的，令人惊喜的消息上。赵参谋处长把在电话上听到的情形，讲给大家听：六纵队昨夜行车，找到一个青年人做向导，这个青年人在带了几站路后，要求回去。因为家里只有一个六十三岁的老母亲，哥哥当红军走了二十年。战士们就向他询问哥哥的姓名，当青年人一说出是陈锡联的时候，很快就被带到司令部。………
    当天上午，一辆手推车停在司令部的门前了。警卫员们把一位穿着蓝色新衣衫，看起来还很健康的老太太迎进屋里。
    司令部里站满了人，大家都在热烈的欢迎这位红军的母亲。
    陈锡联同志还未上前去认，大家就把老太太围得紧紧的。乱嚷嚷的讲道：
    “老太太，你看，哪个是你的儿子？”
    这位老太太，被包围在这么多热情欢愉但都是陌生的人群中间，由于满心喜悦，没有显得丝毫畏怯。她一面很自信的讲着：我认得，我认得。一面把目光在每一个人的脸上，轮转的用力探索着。
    “母亲！”陈锡联同志禁不住的叫了一声。老太太搜寻的目光立刻停止了。她不顾一切的扑上去，双臂就把儿子紧紧的抱住了，嘴里不住的说：
    “是啊！我认得的模样还没有大变………”语声有些哽咽。
    满屋的人都感动得鼻子有些发酸。
    老太太揉揉眼睛，慢慢平静下来。她才眯缝起眼睛，从上到下细细打量着儿子，并且不时的用手去抚摸儿子的前额。陈锡联同志有些羞涩的问母亲：
    “我变了吗？”
    母亲连连的回答：
    就是胖了些，高了些……
    陈锡联同志让母亲在椅子上坐下，老太太抓住儿子的手，只是在流泪。
    “不要哭呵！这样多的人……”儿子安慰她。
    这位具有刚强性格的老太太，马上沾干了眼泪说：
    “好，我不哭。”
    母子二人开始叙起家常来了。陈锡联同志用着回忆般的口吻，轻轻的说：
    “十九年没有见面了！”
    “不只呵！整整二十年呀！”母亲更正着。
    “我记得只有十九年吧！”
    “二十年一点也不错。”母亲固执的说。“这二十年，我是一年一年数着熬过来的，一年有一年受的苦，还会记错？”
    陈锡联同志沉默了。他静静的听着母亲二十年来被迫害的、苦难生活的血泪叙述。老太太一夜也没有停嘴。一幕幕往事的影子，又一次的在老人记忆里复活了。她还记得清清楚楚，一九三○年，那个天翻地覆的年代，遍地起了红军，成立了苏维埃政府，打土豪分田地，穷人坐天下，自己的儿子也结束了放牛娃的挨打受气，没吃没穿的苦日子，参加了红军。但是，第二年，幸福的日子就被蒋介石匪帮夺去了。连过去分的那个吃饭碗，也给抢走了。她知道，幸福的日子还会有，那就是儿子同红军胜利回来的时候。二十年来她为这坚定不移的信念等待着儿子，今天，儿子终于又来到自己眼前了。
    “那么，我走后你怎么样生活的呢？”陈锡联同志问。
    “讨口要饭，我过了好几年。”老太太痛苦的说。“开初，得不着你的信，都说没有你了。大前年，可又传说光山潢川有了红军，我要着饭去找你，差点病死在道上……”
    “这一回，你可听说我回来了？”
    “你们一过黄河，传说就有了。有的说你负了大责任，有的说带着好多队伍，我半个来月就没有睡过觉。十月间，叫你兄弟上黄安去打听，光说你这回是真回来了，可不知道在那里？”老太太越说越起劲，连一点疲倦的样子也没有了。“咱家还住过咱们的队伍呢！我把家里好吃的东西，都拿给他们吃啦。”
    第二天一早，屋子里又挤满了人。连附近的老百姓也都来看母子重逢的喜事。陈锡联同志有意识的开始对母亲谈一些愉快的事，好把一天一夜来那些悲痛的话题转换一下，再送老人家安心的回去。于是，从衣袋里掏出一张照片来说：
    “这是你的媳妇和小孙孙，他们过些天就回家来看你。”
    老太太接过像片，把脚往门口挪动了几步，在明亮的晨光中，将照片放在自己的嘴边上，笑的合不拢嘴。
    陈锡联同志把自己正铺的毛毯，正盖的被子，都送给了母亲。并且笑着问：
    “你还需要什么呀？”
    这位几十年来受尽穷苦折磨的老人，开始接触了幸福。然而，这幸福是革命给她带来的。他那么开阔的说：“你还需要什么呀？”
    “看见你了，什么也不要啦，原先我发愁死了买不上块棺材板；现在，不想这个，只想把老蒋消灭掉多活几年才好。”
    部队晚上有行动，陈锡联同志准备下午派人送母亲回家。黄安这一带毕竟还是一个不大稳定的新区，他想起昨夜母亲所讲的，由于自己革命，家中两个叔叔都被惨害的情形，就体贴的和母亲商量说：
    “把你接到安定的地方去住吧！不的话，有个什么情况，匪军们又要来遭害你！”
    老太太拍着胸膛很强硬的说：
    “我不怕，我就这条老命，看他们敢把我怎么样！过去，他们来找我的事，我就对他们说：我儿子是哪年哪月干红军走的，你想捉就捉我走吧！我本来就是打算死的。他们没法我。现在，你回来了，叫他们再来吧！他们害了我，光村上老百姓也不依！”
    吃过晚饭，司令部全体的人把老太太送出大门。她没有露出一点难过的样子，嘴里还不断的说：
    “我知道，早点把老蒋消灭掉，我们就能早过团圆日子！”
    小车子推着老太太，渐渐离我们远了。我们抑压不住激动的感情，唱起来了：
    “我们要为祖国而战争，保卫你呀！亲爱的母亲！…………”
    立刻，我们就出发向敌人去进攻了。……
