　　Cadres at the Chahar Province Fourth District Administrative Office Cadre School Diligently Study
    Since its establishment over a month ago, the Chahar Province Fourth District Administrative Cadre School has fostered a strong atmosphere of learning and research among its students. Many comrades study by lamp even before the wake-up call, and most are reluctant to go out and play during afternoon breaks after class. Minister Wang of the Chahar Province Fourth District Administrative Office, after inspecting the school's learning situation, said, "What impressed me most was the day I came to class. Everyone not only took notes very seriously but also immediately raised questions or submitted slips of paper when they didn't understand something. As soon as the teacher finished the class, many people stayed in the classroom, discussing in groups of three or five. The spirit of diligent study is truly strong!" The consensus is that the good results are due to: an increased political awareness after ideological examination, and the development of democracy in criticism and education. Current shortcomings are: 1. Due to the initial emphasis on democracy, some students still have a tendency towards extreme democracy. In the future, they should be guided towards the correct path of democracy under centralized guidance. 2. The theoretical courses are taught a bit too deeply. In the future, attention should be paid to moving from the shallow to the deep, and efforts should be made to make the explanations more accessible. Regarding land reform policy, there should be no further emphasis on correcting deviations, but rather on how to pay attention to carrying out the struggle on two fronts. 3. The student union is a mass organization under administrative leadership, which executes the school's educational plan and enlivens student life. The tendency towards becoming an administrative organ should be prevented. (Liu Huo)

　　察省四专署干校
  　学员钻研空气浓厚
    察省四专署行政干部学校成立后，一月多来学员学习研究的空气甚为浓厚。有好多同志在没吹起床哨子前，就点起灯来学习，每天下午课外休息的时候，大多数人都不愿出去玩。察省四专署王部长在检查该校的学习情况后说：“给我印象最深的是我来上课的那天，每个人不仅对记笔记很认真，并且能在不明白的地方，马上就给教员提出来，或者递条子。教员一下课，好多人都不出教室，三个一堆，五个一群的就讨论开了。钻研的空气真是很浓厚！”好的原因，一致认为是：检查思想后，大家的政治觉悟提高，开展了批评和教育上的民主。现存的缺点是：一、由于开始时强调民主，学员中还有些极端民主的倾向，今后应引导大家走向在集中指导下的民主的正确道路。二、理论课教的有点深，今后应注意由浅入深，并且在讲解时力求要通俗些。在土地改革的政策方面，今后不应再强调纠偏，而是如何注意进行两条战线斗争的问题。三、学生会是在行政领导下，执行学校教育计划活跃学员生活的群众性组织，应防止机关化的倾向。（刘火）
