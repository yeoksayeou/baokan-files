　　"Down with the Aggression Alliance" Voice Louder Day by Day in Various Countries
　　While the talks for the "North Atlantic Alliance" are still being conducted secretively in Washington, the voices of "Down with the Aggression Alliance!" and "Defend Democracy and Peace!" are growing louder day by day in the countries that have been, or are being, dragged into this "alliance" by the American reactionaries. In France, hundreds of thousands of working people in Paris held a large-scale demonstration on the 13th. The red flags and huge banners held high by the demonstrators bore words reflecting the hopes and will of the French people: "The French will never fight against the Soviet Union!" "Down with the Atlantic Pact!" "Salute the great fortress of peace in the world – the Soviet Union!" The Political Bureau of the French Communist Party issued a statement on the Atlantic Pact on the 18th, calling on the French people to "unite in action and safeguard peace." The French General Confederation of Labor also issued a communique, urging all working people in France to be vigilant against the "grave threat of a new war" and to rise up to "expand the struggle against the Marshall Plan and defend the policy of national independence." In the United States, the National Council of American-Soviet Friendship and the American Labor Party have launched a new peace movement. The former is urging Truman and Stalin to meet in order to resolve the existing differences between the United States and the Soviet Union. The latter will hold a conference in New York on the 25th as the beginning of the peace movement, which will last for a month. The National Committee of the American Progressive Party recently passed a resolution demanding a halt to the negotiation of the "North Atlantic Pact." The joint committee of the National Women's Committees of the Italian Communist Party and the Socialist Party called on all Italian women to "contribute all their strength to the common struggle, so that the Italian people's will to strive for peace will be respected." The movement against joining the "North Atlantic Alliance" is also unfolding in the three Nordic countries of Sweden, Denmark, and Norway. Even within the ruling party of Norway, the Labor Party, divisions are occurring. On the day that Norwegian Foreign Minister Lange returned from the United States to seek instructions on the issue of joining the "North Atlantic Alliance" (the 19th), the Labor Party held a congress. Although the congress passed Lange's support for the US imperialist aggression policy, "demanding cooperation with the West in military defense," when the vote was taken, 35 of the more than 300 representatives voted against it.
　　When organizing this aggressive bloc of the "North Atlantic Alliance," the American imperialists' excuse is that "America's security is threatened." However, this "threat" is not elsewhere but within America's own gates. The American economy is like a boat leaking water, becoming increasingly heavily tilted to one side. The price crash caused by the crisis of relative overproduction has been continuing since the 4th. As of the 17th, corn has fallen nearly 50% from the price rebound after the sharp fall in February last year. Wheat has fallen from $2.93 per bushel in May last year to $2.12. Beef sold for a maximum of $41.6 per hundred pounds, but now it has fallen to $31. The prices of food, clothing, and other goods are also continuing to fall. The bankruptcy of enterprises promoted by relative overproduction is blowing harder and harder. According to the American private "Dun & Bradstreet" statistics, in the week ending March 10, 192 industrial and commercial companies went bankrupt, compared with only 45 bankrupt companies in the same week in 1947. Following this, the number of unemployed people has greatly increased. Clark, Director of the US Bureau of Labor Statistics, admitted on the 19th that the number of unemployed people in the United States in February had increased by 300,000. The official US unemployment figure for January was 700,000. That is to say, in the month and a half from January to now, the greatly reduced official US unemployment figure has increased from 2 million in December last year to 3 million. And nearly 10 million partially unemployed people are not included. The US official Bureau of the Census also had to take off the false signboard of "full employment" and admit that the number of employed people in January this year had fallen to 57.4 million, while in July last year it was 61.6 million, a decrease of 5.2 million in just half a year. Even the London Financial Times is singing a dirge for the dire American economy: the American post-war economy is "now heading for a huge decline."
　　The liberation movement of the Eastern people continues to develop. The People's Armed Forces of South Korea expanded their struggle in Jeolla Namdo and Jeolla Bukdo in South Korea in the first half of February. They attacked puppet troops and police everywhere. The heroic struggle of the South Korean people and their rapid increase in awareness show how disastrously the US imperialist ruling policy in South Korea has failed. Recently, the people of North and South Korea sent a letter of gratitude to Stalin, which was signed by more than 16.6 million people, of which 9.94 million were residents of South Korea, accounting for two-thirds of the total population of South Korea of 15 million. They participated in the signing at the risk of persecution by the United States and the puppet authorities. This letter expresses the firm will of the entire Korean people to fight for a democratic, unified, and independent new Korea, and especially expresses the hopes and love of the South Korean people for the Soviet Union and North Korea, the hatred and hostility towards US imperialism and the puppet government, and how full of confidence in victory they are in the struggle. They firmly believe that "the national flag of the Korean People's Republic will fly in many places in South Korea." They swore: "We will smash all the cunning conspiracies of domestic and foreign reactionary forces, and we will resolutely and unswervingly carry out the struggle to make the US imperialist troops withdraw from our territory." The Viet Minh army is becoming stronger and stronger. Since December of last year, they have rendered the French invading army unable to launch any large-scale operations. The liberated areas are expanding day by day. According to International Student Union Chairman Grohman on the 19th, the People's Army now controls 95% of Vietnamese territory. The Indonesian people's armed struggle against Dutch imperialism is growing stronger. The People's Guerrilla, with 300,000 people, has made the 130,000 Dutch invading troops isolated and confined to various urban strongholds. The scale of the guerrilla warfare has expanded, inflicting an average of 200 casualties on the Dutch army every day. On the islands of Java and Sumatra, the guerrillas have begun to recover the territory sold out by the Hatta government under the Renville Agreement, and are attacking Yogyakarta and other areas of Java. In this situation, where the Netherlands is unable to restore its ruling "order" by force, American imperialism is playing a new trick, conspiring to undermine the Indonesian people's struggle for freedom, and further extending the aggressive claws of the United States into Indonesia. On January 28, the American reactionaries forced the Security Council under its control to pass a new reactionary resolution, attempting to use Hatta and other Dutch prisoners to organize a puppet government to divide the guerrillas. The American representative of the so-called Indonesian Committee, Cochran, is shuttling between the Netherlands and Indonesia to implement this conspiracy. Cochran forced Sassoon, the Dutch Minister of Overseas Colonies, who was not very obedient to the United States, to resign on the 11th, and led the Dutch government to announce on the 18th that it would release the imprisoned Indonesian traitor government of Sukarno and Hatta, etc., in the near future. The frightened Dutch government was clearly surrendering to its American master, but it still pretended to save face and said that the Indonesian "leaders" would be free to act in Java, but "prohibited from engaging in political activities."
　　Other more important international events recently are as follows:
　　(1) The strike struggle of Italian workers continues to develop. 300,000 municipal workers across Italy went on a large-scale strike on the 15th to demand wage increases. The bloody incident in which Italian police suppressed workers at the Liri paper mill in southeastern Rome on the 17th triggered a wave of strikes and protests by the Italian working people.
　　(2) Shigeru Yoshida, the leader of the Democratic Liberal Party, the largest party in the reactionary Japanese House of Representatives, formed a new reactionary cabinet on the 16th as usual. The Japanese Communist Party and the Labor-Farmer Party issued statements respectively, deciding to mobilize national democratic forces to oppose the Yoshida Cabinet.
　　(3) Anna Louise Strong, an American spy reporter who had long disguised herself as a progressive, was arrested in Moscow on the 14th by the Soviet security organs for espionage and sabotage activities against the Soviet Union, and will be deported.

### “打倒侵略联盟”的声音　在各国一天比一天响亮了

　　“打倒侵略联盟”的声音
  　在各国一天比一天响亮了
    当“北大西洋联盟”的会谈仍在华盛顿鬼鬼祟祟地个别进行时，“打倒侵略联盟！”“保卫民主和平！”的声音，在被美国反动派拉入或企图拉入这个“联盟”的国家内，是一天比一天响亮了。在法国，巴黎数十万劳动人民十三日举行大示威，在示威者高举着的红旗和巨幅标语上，写着反映法国人民的希望和意志的话：“法国人决不与苏联作战！”“打倒大西洋公约！”“向全世界和平的伟大堡垒——苏联致敬！”法国共产党政治局十八日发表关于大西洋公约的声明，召唤法国人民“团结行动、维护和平”。法国总工会亦发表公报，要法国一切劳动人民警惕“新战争的严重威胁”，要他们起来“扩大反对马歇尔计划和维护国家独立政策的斗争”。在美国，美苏友谊全国协会和美国劳工党已发动一个新的和平运动。前者力促杜鲁门和斯大林会见，以解决美苏间现存的分歧。后者将于二十五日在纽约召开大会，作为和平运动的开始，这个运动将持续一个月之久。美国进步党全国委员会最近通过决议，要求停止商谈“北大西洋公约”。意大利共产党与社会党之两党全国妇女委员会的合作委员会号召全意妇女“将一切力量贡献于共同斗争，使意大利人民争取和平的意志得到尊重。”反对参加“北大西洋联盟”的运动，亦正在北欧的瑞、丹、挪三国展开。甚至连挪威的执政党——劳工党内部，亦在发生着分裂。在挪威外长兰基对参加“北大西洋联盟”问题向美请示归来的那一天（十九日），劳工党召开了代表大会，大会虽然通过了兰基支持美帝国主义的侵略政策，“要求在军事防御方面与西方合作”，但当投票时，在三百余名代表中，有三十五名投了反对票。
    美国帝国主义在组织这个“北大西洋联盟”的侵略集团时，它们的一个借口是“美国的安全受到威胁”，然而这个“威胁”不在别处，却在美国自己的大门内。美国的经济好比一只漏进水的船，正在日益沉重地偏向一方。因生产相对过剩危机所引起的物价暴跌，自四日开始至今仍在继续。到十七日为止，玉蜀黍已较去年二月暴跌后所回涨的价格跌落近百分之五十。小麦已从去年五月每蒲式耳的二元九角三分，跌到二元一角二分。牛肉一百磅最高时卖到四十一元六角，现在跌到三十一元。粮食、衣服等价格亦在继续下跌。生产相对过剩所促成的企业的倒风正越吹越紧。据美国私营的“邓恩·布勒得斯特里特”统计所说，在三月十日为止的一周中，有一百九十二个工商业公司破产，一九四七年同周破产的公司只有四十五个。继之而来的，失业的人数大大增加了。美国劳工统计局局长克拉克十九日承认：美国二月份的失业人数已增加了三十万。一月份的失业人数，美国官方统计是七十万。这就是说，自今年一月份起到现在的一个半月内，大大缩小的美国官方统计的失业人数，也自去年十二月的二百万人，增加到三百万人。而近千万的部分失业者尚未包括在内。美官方的国情普查局亦不得不自己摘下了“充分就业”的假招牌，承认今年一月份就业人数已降为五千七百四十万人，而去年七月则为六千一百六十万人，仅半年内即减少了五百二十万人。就连伦敦的金融时报亦在替美国恶劣的经济唱着挽歌了：美国战后的经济“现在正走向巨大的下降”。
    东方人民的解放运动仍在继续发展中。南朝鲜的人民武装，二月上半月在南朝鲜的全罗南道和全罗北道扩大斗争。他们到处袭击傀儡军和警察、南朝鲜人民的英勇斗争以及它们觉悟程度的迅速提高，说明美帝国主义在南朝鲜的统治政策，是如何一败涂地了。最近南北朝鲜人民寄给斯大林一封表示感谢的信，在这封信上签名的有一千六百余万人，其中九百九十四万是南朝鲜的居民，占南朝鲜总人口一千五百万的三分之二。他们是冒着美国和傀儡当局迫害的危险而参加签名的。这封信写出了全朝鲜人民为民主的统一独立的新朝鲜而斗争的坚强意志，尤其写出了南朝鲜人民对苏联、北朝鲜的希望和热爱，对美帝国主义和傀儡政府的憎恶和仇视，对斗争是如何充满了胜利的信心。他们坚信着：“朝鲜人民共和国的国旗，将要在南朝鲜许多地方飘扬”。他们宣誓着：“将粉碎国内外反动势力的一切狡猾的阴谋诡计，将坚决不渝地进行斗争，使美帝国主义的军队撤出我国领土”。越盟的军队愈战愈强了。它们使法国侵略军自去年十二月份起，已无力发动任何大规模作战。使解放区一天天地扩大。据国际学联主席格罗曼十九日说，人民军现已控制了越南领土的百分之九十五。印尼人民反对荷兰帝国主义的武装斗争，日益壮大。拥有三十万人的人民游击队，使十三万荷兰侵略军孤立困守于各城市据点。游击队作战的规模扩大了，平均每日予荷军二百名的杀伤。在爪哇、苏门答腊两岛上，游击队已开始恢复被哈达政府根据伦维尔协定出卖的国土，并正在进攻日惹及爪哇其他地区。在这种荷兰已无法以武力恢复其统治“秩序”的情况下，美帝国主义正在玩弄一种新花样，阴谋破坏印尼人民的自由斗争；并把美国的侵略魔手更进一步伸入印尼。美国反动派在一月二十八日强使在它控制下的安理会通过了新的反动决议，企图利用荷兰的俘虏哈达等出来组织傀儡政府，以分化游击队。所谓印尼委员会的美国代表柯契伦，正为实行这个阴谋而弃波于荷兰和印尼间。柯契伦压迫对美国不太驯服的荷兰海外殖民部长沙逊于十一日辞了职，又牵着荷兰政府于十八日宣布：短期内释放被俘的印尼卖国政府的苏加诺和哈达等。表示惊惧的荷兰政府分明是向其美国主人屈服了，但还要死装着面子说：印尼“领袖”们将在爪哇自由行动，但“禁止从事政治活动”。
    最近国际间其他较重要事件如下：
    （一）意大利工人的罢工斗争继续发展。全意三十万市政工人十五日实行要求增加工资的大罢工。意大利警察十七日镇压罗马东南利里镇造纸厂工人的血腥事件，引起了意国劳动人民的罢工和抗议浪潮。
    （二）日本反动的众院第一大党民主自由党党魁吉田茂，于十六日循例组成新的反动内阁。日本共产党和工农党分别发表声明，决定动员全国民主力量反对吉田内阁。
    （三）长期伪装进步的美国间谍女记者斯特朗，因进行反苏的间谍和破坏活动罪，已于十四日被苏联保安机关在莫斯科逮捕，并将被驱逐出境。
