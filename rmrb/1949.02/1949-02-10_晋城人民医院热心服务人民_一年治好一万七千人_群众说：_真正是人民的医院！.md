　　Jincheng People's Hospital Devotedly Serves the People
  　Curing 17,000 People in a Year
    The Masses Say: "Truly a Hospital of the People!"
    Meritorious Service on the Front Lines While Serving with the Army
  　Available Day or Night Upon Request
    [Taiyue Telegram] The Jincheng People's Hospital has made great contributions to the people over the past two years and has developed rapidly. Its capital has grown from 730,000 yuan to 12 million yuan (equivalent to over 30 million yuan at current prices). The number of doctors has increased from three to thirteen, and the total number of staff has reached forty-seven. It has also established branches and pharmacies in Dayang and Bagong. In terms of contributions to the people over the past two years: First, it has accompanied the militia on expeditions to the front lines fifteen times, each time for more than three months, treating over a thousand sick and injured people each time. During the Jinzhong Campaign, it treated 564 people at one time. They were very considerate of the wounded and sick: After the Jinzhong Campaign, they took more than ten seriously wounded and dozens of lightly wounded people with them. When returning, they marched one day during the day and continued to treat patients at night. By the time they returned to Jincheng, the lightly wounded had recovered, and the seriously wounded had arrived at the hospital safely. Therefore, at the county's celebration meeting, they received a banner with the inscription "Outstanding Achievements on the Front." Second, whether in outpatient or outreach services, they carefully and cautiously treat patients. When providing outreach services, they are available day or night upon request, and sometimes even without being requested. For example, a child in Xiaodongguan was dying, but the family could not afford to hire a doctor. When the hospital learned about this, they automatically went to diagnose the child and cured him. In the past year, they have treated a total of 17,603 people, with 17,004 people treated through outreach services, and assisted in 113 deliveries. In Canzhangwuzhuang and Nanfahuaicun, several women had "dystocia," and the village midwives could not handle it. After the doctors from the People's Hospital assisted in the deliveries, both the adults and children were safe. Third, they unite, help, and cultivate doctors throughout the county to serve the people together. The county has a large population and few doctors, and relying solely on the People's Hospital cannot solve the problem. With the help of the government, they convened a symposium of doctors from all over the county in June of last year and organized a medical and health research association. They united doctors throughout the county, strengthened research in technology, and strengthened contact in business. The People's Hospital has become the central organization for contact and research for doctors throughout the county. If village doctors encounter any difficulties in treatment, they ask the People's Hospital for help. For example, Liu Zengfu, a doctor in Shuibei Village, encountered "dystocia" during a delivery and could not handle it. He requested help from the People's Hospital. It was late at night, but the doctor set off immediately. In addition to safely delivering the baby, they also told Liu Zengfu in detail about the experience of delivering dystocia and normal deliveries. In order to train more talents, the People's Hospital opened a medical training class in August last year, training fifty-four young people with aspirations to study medicine. Most of them have now returned to their villages to serve the masses. They are now preparing to open the second phase. Fourth, they systematically pay attention to social health campaigns: estimating what diseases are likely to occur and carrying out prevention work. They convene doctor seminars or print prescriptions and distribute them to villages to let the masses prevent diseases. If a disease has already occurred, they quickly organize doctors to go to the countryside to treat it. Last year, when malaria was prevalent in Shuangmiao Village, the hospital doctors immediately went to the village, quickly treating the disease and publicizing the source of malaria to encourage everyone to prevent it, and it was completely cured in seven days. Because of their enthusiastic service to the people, the people of Jincheng say, "The People's Hospital is truly our people's hospital." Although they have made the above achievements, they are not arrogant or complacent. At the second anniversary celebration of the hospital on New Year's Day this year, the president proposed to all the comrades in the hospital: In the future, we must study harder, build the hospital more perfectly and soundly, and do more for the people.

　　晋城人民医院热心服务人民
  　一年治好一万七千人
    群众说：“真正是人民的医院！”
    随军参战前线立功
  　深更半夜随请随到
    【太岳电】晋城人民医院，二年来对人民有很大的贡献，得到迅速发展。资金由七十三万元发展到一千二百万元（如按现在物价计算则有三千余万元）。医生由三人发展到十三人，全院工作人员已发展到四十七人。并在大阳、巴公两处建立分院与药房。二年来在对人民的贡献上：首先是随民兵远征前线先后十五次，每次在三个月以上，治好病人和彩号在千人以上。晋中战役中，一次即医好五百六十四人。他们对伤病员非常体贴：晋中战役结束后，带了十多个重彩号和几十个轻彩号，返回时白天行军一天，夜晚照常给病人治疗。待回到晋城，轻彩号已痊愈。重彩号亦安然到达医院。因此在全县人民庆功大会上，得到“绩著前方”的奖旗。第二、无论门诊出诊，都能小心谨慎地为病人治疗。出诊时，不分昼夜，随请随到，甚至不请自到。如小东关一个小孩病得快死了，但没钱请医生，该院知道了，就自动去诊断，并给治好了。去年一年来共医好一万七千六百零三人，出外治好的即有一万七千零四人，接产一百十三人。参张吴庄、南筏怀村有好几个妇女“横生”，村里的接生婆都没办法，后经人民医院医生接产，大人小孩都得到安全。第三、团结、帮助、培养全县医生，共同为人民服务。该县人口多，医生少，单纯依靠人民医院是解决不了问题的，他们就在政府帮助下，于去年六月召开了全县医生座谈会，组织了医药卫生研究会。团结全县医生，在技术上加强研究；在业务上加强联系。人民医院成为全县医生联系和研究的中心机关。在乡医生如在治疗中发生什么疑难时，即请人民医院帮助。如水北村医生刘增福，一次接产“横生”，接不下来请求人民医院帮助，那时正是深夜，但医生立刻出发。除安全接出外，并将接产横生、立生等经验，详细告诉刘增福。人民医院为了培养更多的人材，去年八月间开办了医务训练班，训练了五十四个有志学医的青年，现大部回村为群众服务。现又准备开办第二期。第四、有计划地注意社会卫生运动：估计到要发生什么病，就进行预防工作。召开医生座谈会，或编印处方发到村，让群众预防。病已发生了，就迅速组织医生下乡去治疗。去年双庙村疟疾流行时，该院医生便马上到该村，一面迅速医治，一面宣传疟疾的来源让大家预防，七天就全治好了。由于他们这样热心地服务人民，晋城人民都说：“人民医院真是咱人民的医院”。虽然有了以上成绩，但他们毫不骄傲自满。在今年元旦，该院成立二周年纪念会上，院长向全院同志提出：今后要更加努力学习，把医院建设得更完满更健全，为人民作更多的事情。
