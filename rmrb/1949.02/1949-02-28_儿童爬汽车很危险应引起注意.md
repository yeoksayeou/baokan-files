Criticism and Suggestions

　　Children Climbing on Cars is Dangerous and Should be Noticed
To the Editor:
　　On the 12th of this month, I was driving to Guosu Village. When passing through villages such as Baisha, Licun, Pingshan, and Huishe, the children in the villages, upon hearing the sound of the car, would chase after it and climb on. The car runs fast, and some have fallen and broken their faces, while others have bumped their noses. I think this is very dangerous. If you tell them not to climb, they won't listen, and they are not afraid of criticism. At the same time, they climb on from the back of the car, so the drivers cannot see them.
　　My suggestion is to mention this in the newspaper and have the parents of every child and the teachers of elementary schools in each village talk about the dangers of climbing on cars during class, to avoid accidents.

### 儿童爬汽车很危险应引起注意

　　儿童爬汽车很危险应引起注意编辑同志：
    我在本月十二日开着车到郭苏村去，当由白沙、李村、平山、回舍等村经过时，沿村的小孩，听见车的响声，即追来爬上。车子跑的快，有摔破脸的，有碰破鼻子的，我看这样很危险。说不让爬他不听，批评又不怕，同时他们是在车子后面爬，司机的又看不见。
    我的意见是在报纸上讲讲，让每个儿童的家长及各村小学教员在上课时说说爬车的危险性，以免发生意外。　　　　　　　华北大学校部工人洛彭
