　　Commander Liu Bocheng Guides Making Cotton-Padded Clothes
　　Yang Guoyu
　　In the winter of 1947, Commander Liu Bocheng was returning from a walk outside a village in the Dabie Mountains when he saw the headquarters using colorful cloth to make clothes.
　　He asked in a reproaching tone:
　　"Who told you to sew them without dyeing them?"
　　"The government didn't issue dye!"
　　Commander Liu, just like he usually taught comrades about everything, said in a very serious tone:
　　"Comrades! The proletarian ranks have no insurmountable difficulties. Ashes from burnt straw and sesame stalks are the best dyes. No matter how difficult, we must wear gray clothes. We are an army, not a Yangko dance troupe."
　　Two days later, all the floral and colored cloth had been dyed gray. The only thing missing was a cotton-fluffing bow. The soldiers used thin bamboo strips or hard wooden sticks to beat the cotton into a string bow, and the cotton-padded clothes they made were soft and comfortable to wear. There were also those who talked about mechanics and read books, but were at a loss at this time, and their cotton-padded clothes were full of bumps. Some people didn't learn from others, opening a monk collar and locking it with a chicken-butt buttonhole. The pockets were not aligned up and down, the stitching was crooked and sparse, and the cotton padding was uneven, like the South Pacific islands on a map. Wearing it showed a whole body of nodules, which was really unsightly. When Commander Liu saw this kind of person who did not seriously rectify himself in the face of difficulties, he pierced their hearts with a few concise words:
　　"Taking sloppiness as glory is not glory."
　　Everyone wasn't born a tailor, and many really couldn't get the hang of it. Commander Liu heard the comrades shouting, "The cotton-padded clothes are sewn well, but the collar is difficult to open!" So he took a Western-style porcelain bowl and personally taught them:
　　"You buckle it on the collar, leaving two centimeters in the center of the back seam of the cotton-padded clothes; draw a circle with a pencil, and the opening will be the same as your neck."
　　He also pointed to a roughly sewn cotton-padded coat and continued:
　　"Use a crochet needle to sew pockets, the stitching must be straight, tight, and even, and the buttonholes must be backstitched."
　　Everyone did as he said, and the cotton-padded clothes they made were almost the same as those produced in a clothing factory.

　　刘伯承司令员指导做棉衣
    杨国宇
    一九四七年的冬天，刘伯承司令员在大别山的一个村外散步回来，见司令部用花布裁衣。
    他用指责的口气问：
    “谁叫你们不染就缝？”
    “公家没发染料！”
    刘司令员象平时教诲同志们每件事情一样，语气很沉重地说：
    “同志！无产阶级的队伍，没有不能克服的困难，稻草芝麻秆烧成灰，都是最好的染料。无论如何困难，我们都要穿灰衣服，我们是军队，不是秧歌队。”
    过了两天，所有花的、带色的布都染成一色灰，所缺者只是弹花弓。战士们用细竹条，或硬木棍将棉花打成线弓弹，做出的棉衣是软绵绵的很好穿。也有讲力学看本本的人，到这时确束手无策，他的棉衣尽是疙瘩。有的人不向别人学习，开一个和尚领口，锁的是鸡屁股扣门，荷包上下对不齐，线路又歪又稀，铺的棉花起伏不平，象地图上的南洋群岛，穿在身上现出一身瘩瘤，实在难看。刘司令员见了这种在困难面前不加严肃整顿自己的人，便以简洁的几个字刺进他们的心脏：
    “以滥为荣不是光荣。”
    大家不全是天生的裁缝，有许多的确不得其门，刘司令员听见同志们嚷着“棉衣缝好，领难开！”就拿着洋磁碗亲自教导说：
    “你把他扣在领口的地方，向棉衣背缝正中留出二公分；用铅笔画一道圈，这样开出的口，与你颈项一样。”
    他又指着一件缝的很粗糙的棉衣接着说：
    “缝荷包要用勾针，线路要正要密要匀，锁扣门要倒线。”
    大家都照他说的去做，做出的棉衣，差不多与缝衣工厂出品一样。
