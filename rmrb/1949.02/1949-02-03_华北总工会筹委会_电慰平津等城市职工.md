　　The Preparatory Committee of the North China Federation of Trade Unions
　　Sends Telegram of Condolences to Workers in Cities Such as Peiping and Tientsin
　　[Reported by this newspaper] Workers in factories, railways, and mines in newly liberated cities such as Peiping, Tientsin, Tangshan, Zhangjiakou, Changxindian, and Mentougou, at the risk of hardship, protected machinery and materials before liberation, and quickly resumed work and developed production after liberation, making great contributions. The Preparatory Committee of the North China Federation of Trade Unions and all the workers of the Jinhua Textile Factory in Yuci extend their condolences and congratulate them on their liberation. The original telegram is as follows:
　　To the worker brothers of factories, railways, and mines in Peiping, Tientsin, Tangshan, Tanggu, Dagu, Changxindian, Mentougou, Shijingshan, Baoding, Zhangjiakou, Xuanhua, and Xiahuayuan:
　　After the Japanese imperialists surrendered, the traitor Chiang Kai-shek clique colluded with the American imperialists and launched a nationwide civil war, plunging the people who had been occupied for eight years into Chiang's bloody rule; especially our worker brothers, who were constantly threatened by unemployment, poverty, and hunger. In order to survive, you have carried out unyielding struggles against the civil war, persecution, and for freedom, always inheriting the glorious tradition of heroic struggle of our working class. Although the workers in the liberated areas were separated from you in two worlds at that time, we were all advancing side by side to quickly defeat the reactionary rule of the American Chiang in China!
　　Now, you have finally been liberated! This is something worth celebrating for all our working-class brothers!
　　As the powerful offensive of our People's Liberation Army continues to advance, and as our enemies are facing complete annihilation, they are not willing for our worker brothers to be liberated. In order to break our rice bowls, they have attempted to sabotage factories, railways, mines, and all machinery, destroying these assets that are about to become the property of the people. Under these circumstances, you have protected factories and machinery in an organized manner in various ways, regardless of any danger. And all assisted the People's Liberation Army in complete acceptance, thereby laying the foundation for the rapid resumption of production after liberation. Your contribution is extremely great.
　　Not only that, but after liberation, under the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party and the People's Government, you were able to work enthusiastically, quickly restore production, and actively work, powerfully supporting the People's Liberation War. For example, after the workers in Zhangjiakou resumed production, they rushed to manufacture a large number of siege equipment; Shijingshan and Xiahuayuan will soon be able to send electricity; only a few days after the liberation of Tianjin, municipal industry has been initially restored, and the coal output of mines will also catch up with the number during the reactionary rule of the Kuomintang... These are all achievements obtained through the efforts of all our workers! This heroic posture in production is the supreme glory of our working class. To this end, this Preparatory Committee, on behalf of all workers in North China, extends its lofty and cordial condolences to you! And hopes that all our worker comrades, under the leadership of our working-class party—the Chinese Communist Party and Chairman Mao, will make persistent efforts, continuously improve awareness, and strive for greater victories on our production front, just like other fronts!
　　　　　　　The Preparatory Committee of the North China Federation of Trade Unions　　January 27
　　To the worker comrades of factories in newly liberated cities such as Tianjin, Tangshan, Zhangjiakou, Changxindian, and Mentougou:
　　First of all, we celebrate your liberation! Not long ago, we suffered from the poison of the Kuomintang reactionaries just like you. Now it's good, the factory has become our home, and we enjoy the joy of liberation. We have seen in the newspapers that you have protected machinery and materials in battle, overcome all difficulties after liberation, quickly resumed work, and organized to improve production. We feel extremely excited and encouraged. The victorious situation is developing day by day, and the complete collapse of the Kuomintang reactionaries is not far away. Let us further unite. Under the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party and the leader of the Chinese people, Chairman Mao Zedong, actively produce, support the front, and strive to completely eliminate the US imperialist forces of aggression in China and the remaining military forces of the Kuomintang reactionary government, and fight to the end for the liberation of all the Chinese people!

　　华北总工会筹委会
  　电慰平津等城市职工
    【本报讯】平、津、唐山、张垣、长辛店、门头沟等新解放城市各工厂、铁路、矿山职工，在解放前不避艰险，保护机器、资材，解放后迅速复工，发展生产，贡献甚大，华北总工会筹委会暨榆次晋华纺织工厂全体职工特致电慰问，并祝贺他们的解放。原电如下：平、津、唐山、塘沽、大沽、长辛店、门头沟、石景山、保定、张家口、宣化、下花园等地各工厂、铁路、矿山的职工兄弟们：
    日本帝国主义投降以后，卖国贼蒋介石匪帮又勾引美国帝国主义，发动了全国规模的大内战，沦陷八年的人民又陷入了蒋匪的血腥统治；尤其我们职工兄弟们，时刻都遭受着失业、贫困和饥饿的威胁。你们为了救死求生曾进行了不屈不挠的反内战、反迫害和争自由的斗争，始终继承着我们工人阶级英勇奋斗的光荣传统。解放区的工友们当时虽与你们分割在两个世界，但我们都是为着迅速的打垮美蒋在中国的反动统治在并肩前进着！
    现在，你们终于得到了解放！这是值得我们全体工人阶级的弟兄们欢庆的！
    当我们人民解放军的强大攻势继续进展的时候，当我们的敌人正面临全部被消灭的时候，他们是不甘心我们工人弟兄们得到解放的，他们为了打破我们的饭碗，曾企图破坏工厂、铁路、矿山和一切机器，破坏这些即将成为人民的财富。在这种情形下，你们不避任何艰险，以各种方式有组织的保护了工厂、机器。并都协助人民解放军完整接收，从而也奠定了解放后迅速恢复生产的基础。你们这个功劳是极大的。
    不仅如此，在解放以后，你们在中国共产党和人民政府的领导下，能热情的劳动，迅速恢复生产，积极工作，有力的支援了人民解放战争。如张垣工人恢复生产后，大量赶制攻坚器材，石景山、下花园很快就可送电，天津解放仅数天，市政工业即已初步恢复，矿山煤产量也将赶上国民党反动统治时的数目，各地铁路迅速恢复通车………等。这都是我们全体职工的努力而得到的成绩！在生产中的这种英勇的姿态，是我们工人阶级的无尚光荣。为此，本筹委会特代表华北全体职工向你们致以崇高的亲切的慰问！并望我们全体职工同志们，在我们工人阶级的政党——中国共产党和毛主席领导下，再接再厉，不断提高觉悟，在我们的生产战线上，也将和其他的战线一样，争取更伟大的胜利！
  　　　　　　　华北总工会筹委会　　一月二十七日天津、唐山、张家口、长辛店、门头沟等各新解放城市工厂职工同志们：
    首先我们庆祝你们的解放！在不久以前，我们和你们一样遭受着国民党反动派的毒害。如今好了，工厂成了我们的家，我们享受解放的快乐。我们从报纸上看到你们在战斗中保护机器、物资，解放后克服一切困难，迅速复工及组织起来提高生产等情况，我们感到无比的兴奋与鼓舞。胜利形势日益发展，国民党反动派彻底的崩溃已为期不远了，让我们更进一步的团结起来。在中国共产党和中国人民领袖毛泽东主席的领导下，积极生产，支援前线，为彻底肃清美帝国主义在华侵略势力及国民党反动政府的残余军事力量，争取全中国人民的解放而奋斗到底！
  　　　山西榆次县晋华纺织厂全体职工
  　一月二十七日
