Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, February 25th: Representatives of 950,000 industrial workers in northern England held an important meeting in Manchester, the world-renowned center of the British cotton textile industry, to denounce the aggressive policies of American and British warmongers, oppose the signing of the North Atlantic Treaty, and demand peace and strengthened friendship with the Soviet Union. According to TASS, London, February 20th, the meeting was organized by the Lancashire and Cheshire District Committee of the British-Soviet Friendship Society and was supported by the Lancashire and Cheshire Trades Union Federation. The various trade union organizations, representing 950,000 workers, signed a declaration for world peace at the meeting, stating: "We believe that the people of the world do not want war—whether they are the people of Britain, the Soviet Union, the United States, or any other country. We also believe that strengthening British-Soviet relations and friendship—a goal we vow to continue striving for—can prevent war and concretely advance the cause of world peace."

The declaration has been submitted to Comrade Korovin, representative of the Soviet Embassy, for forwarding to the Leningrad Oblast Trade Union Committee. Newbold, secretary of the Manchester and Salford Trades Union Council and the Lancashire and Cheshire Trades Union Federation, declared when presenting this declaration amid thunderous applause: "I am proud to make this representation to the Soviet Union. I present this declaration to them with all the sincerity and fervor of the Lancashire and Cheshire labor movement. Long live the solidarity of the British working class and the Soviet workers!" Korovin, Counselor of the Soviet Embassy in Britain, responded at the meeting: "We know that the working people of Britain, like the working people of the Soviet Union, do not want war. Strengthening the friendship between our two countries is one of the conditions for safeguarding peace. I assure you that the Soviet Union will be your true and loyal ally in the struggle for peace."

The conference unanimously passed a motion proposed by progressive Member of Parliament Mills. The resolution called on the British government to fully implement the Treaty of Cooperation and Mutual Assistance signed between Britain and the Soviet Union in May 1942; and urged the Labor government to expand British-Soviet trade to promote peace and prosperity, to begin negotiations with the Soviet Union to immediately resolve the Berlin dispute and establish a unified Germany; to refuse to sign the North Atlantic Treaty to demonstrate its intention of peace, and to agree to the Soviet government's policy of reducing armaments and abolishing atomic bombs. In presenting this motion, Mills condemned the Labor government for violating friendship and cooperation with the Soviet Union and for involving Britain in the US imperialist camp that is preparing for a third world war. Mills said: "Those responsible for this bear the responsibility for the greatest crime of treason in our history." Mills pointed out that the purpose of the North Atlantic Treaty is to oppose the Soviet Union. "We must kill this treaty before it kills us. The British people must do everything possible to prevent the British government from signing the Atlantic Pact." Speaking of the Berlin issue, Mills pointed out: "Our right to remain in Berlin is based on the four-power agreement on all of Germany. If we do not restore four-power cooperation, then we must withdraw from Berlin." Referring to trade with the Soviet Union, Mills said: Britain's economic position depends on trade with the Soviet Union and Eastern European countries.

A second motion, proposed by Sloan, was unanimously passed by the conference. The motion expressed the determination to cooperate with the British-Soviet Friendship Association to implement a policy of friendly cooperation with the Soviet Union. Sloan said in his speech: "Let us make it clear to the United States: British workers do not want to fight the Soviet Union. As long as we persist in our struggle, the warmongers will have to shelve the war they are planning."

Another motion passed by the conference announced "the establishment of the Lancashire and Cheshire Trades Union Advisory Committee, whose tasks are as follows: First, to cooperate with the British-Soviet Friendship Association to disseminate accurate knowledge about the Soviet Union among trade union members; second, to exchange respects and information between British and Soviet trade unions."

　　英九十五万产业工人代表集会
  　力促英政府不签订大西洋公约
    签署宣言要求和平与加强对苏友谊
    “我们必须不等这个条约杀死我们就先杀死它！”
    【新华社陕北二十五日电】英国北部九十五万产业工人的代表，在世界著名的英国棉织工业中心曼彻斯特举行重要集会，痛斥美英战争贩子的侵略政策，反对签订北大西洋公约，要求和平与加强对苏友谊。据塔斯社伦敦二十日讯，这一集会为英苏协会兰开夏与柴夏区委员会所组织，并获得兰开夏和柴夏工会联合会的支持。代表九十五万工人的各工会组织，在会上签署了争取世界和平的宣言，指出：“我们相信，全世界的人民不想战争——不论是英国、苏联或美国，和其他任何国家的人民，都不想战争。我们也相信，加强英苏关系与友谊——这是我们立誓继续努力以求达到的目标——就可以防止战争，并能具体地推进世界和平的事业。”
    该宣言已递交苏大使馆代表柯罗文转交列宁格勒州工会委员会。曼彻斯特与萨尔福德工会委员会和兰开夏与柴夏工会联合会书记纽波德，在雷动掌声中提出这一宣言时宣称：“我以向苏联作这种表示为荣。我以兰开夏和柴夏职工运动的一切诚意和热望把这个宣言交给他们。英国工人阶级与苏联工人团结万岁！”苏联驻英大使馆参事柯罗文在大会上致答词说：“我们知道，英国劳动人民和苏联劳动人民一样不想战争。加强我们两国之间的友谊，是保障和平的条件之一。我向你们保证：在争取和平的斗争中，苏联将是你们的真实而忠诚的盟友。”
    大会一致通过进步国会议员米尔斯提出的议案。这一决议要求英政府全部履行英苏两国于一九四二年五月签订的合作与互助条约；并敦促工党政府扩大英苏贸易以促进和平与繁荣，与苏联开始谈判以立即解决柏林纠纷和建立统一的德国；拒绝签订北大西洋公约以表示其和平的意图，并且同意苏联政府提出的缩减军备与废除原子弹的政策。米尔斯在提出这一议案时，谴责工党政府违犯对苏友谊与合作和使英国卷入正在准备第三次世界大战的美帝国主义阵营中。米尔斯说：“对这事情负责的人，在我国历史上负有最大的叛国罪行的责任。”米尔斯指出：北大西洋公约的目的，在于反对苏联。“我们必须不等这个条约杀死我们就先杀死它。英国人民必须尽一切努力使英国政府不签订大西洋公约。”谈到柏林问题时，米尔斯指出：“我们留在柏林的权利，是以四国关于全德国的协定为基础的，假如我们不恢复四国合作，那么，我们就必须退出柏林。”米尔斯谈到对苏贸易时说：英国经济地位有赖于对苏联及对东欧国家的贸易。
    第二个议案由斯洛安提出，为大会所一致通过。该议案表示了与英苏协会合作以实现对苏友好合作政策的决心。斯洛安演说时指出：“让我们明白告诉美国吧：英国工人不愿对苏联作战。只要我们坚持我们的斗争，战争贩子将不得不搁起他们正在谋划的战争。”
    大会通过的另一议案宣布“建立兰开夏与柴夏工会咨询委员会，其任务如下：第一，与英苏协会合作，在工会会员间传播关于苏联的真实知识；第二，在英苏工会之间互致敬意并交换情报。”
