[Jinzhong Electric] The leading organs in Pingyao City have one-sidedly taken care of factory owners and seriously neglected the interests of workers, causing dissatisfaction among the workers. Since the liberation of the city in July last year, private industry and commerce have been greatly restored and developed. The cotton textile industry alone (including weaving cloth, towels, and socks) has increased from 10 companies before liberation to 143, with the number of male and female workers and apprentices increasing from 136 to 1,000. However, because the leading organs and cadres of the city have a one-sided understanding of our party's policy of protecting and developing industry and commerce, mistakenly believing that the establishment of a trade union by workers would stimulate the factory side and affect shutdowns, and incorrectly implement the policy of benefiting both labor and capital, the interests of the workers have been severely damaged. For a long time, there were no cadres in the city specializing in workers' work. Even if some cadres did some work incidentally, it was only limited to understanding the general situation. At the end of October last year, a trade union cadre was assigned, but soon transferred away, causing our relationship with the workers to gradually weaken and our leadership over various industries to weaken day by day. This led to the serious phenomenon of old guilds and larger factories excluding newly opened factories by "cutting off yarn supply" (now corrected). Because the work of workers was not done well, the broad masses of workers and general laborers could not understand our party's industrial and commercial policies well. The old guilds of factory owners still excessively exploited and even oppressed workers. For example, although the cotton textile industry guild has been changed to a committee system, many old rules that suppressed and bound workers have not actually been abolished. Therefore, wages are lowered at will, wages are deducted for machine repair time, and phenomena such as deducting meal money for illness and beating workers and apprentices still exist. The most unreasonable thing is that in the case of constant price fluctuations, wages are not calculated in kind (mainly in weaving factories). Capitalists use kinship and master-apprentice relationships, or seize the workers' fear of unemployment, to numb and threaten workers to endure these extra exploitations. Taking weaving workers as an example, when the price of wheat was 50,000 to 60,000 yuan (Ji banknotes) per stone in September and October last year, each weaving of a bolt of cloth earned 3,000 yuan in addition to meals, and a worker could earn one stone of wheat per month; recently, when the price of wheat rose to 150,000 to 160,000 yuan, wages only increased to 4,000 yuan, with the highest being 5,000 yuan. Moreover, many factory owners do not stipulate fixed wages, and delay paying wages for three or four months. When workers ask, they prevaricate and say: "Look at everyone (referring to other factories), anyway, there is a general idea in the industry." Before liberation, barbers shared profits with the owner on a 30/70 basis (30% for workers, 70% for the owner), in addition to meals. All the exorbitant taxes and levies of the Yan bandit were borne by the owner. After liberation, all exorbitant taxes and levies have been abolished, and the business tax is extremely light, but profits are still shared on a 30/70 basis. The owner's profits have greatly increased, and the workers' income is not enough to maintain their lives. On the 10th of this month, seventeen barbers from nine barber shops asked the guild and the owners for wage increases, but not only were their demands not met, but the leader Wei Guishan and the owner of Linglingtang, Li Yuan, retorted: "We can't afford it, you can take a break!" The next day, all the barbers went on strike. The workers who were originally in the old liberated areas and Shijiazhuang understand our party's employee policies and demanded the establishment of trade unions. Some criticized our leading organs and cadres, saying: "You have held all kinds of meetings since entering the city, but you have never held a workers' meeting." (Note: The phenomenon of neglecting workers' work is common in the county towns of the Third Administrative Region. For example, barbers in Jiexiu also went on strike for three days around January 10 because their demands for wage increases were not resolved.) The municipal party committee has paid attention to this phenomenon: in addition to holding a barbers' meeting on the 11th to ensure a reasonable solution, it also conveyed the spirit of the administrative office's urban work meeting last month. In recent days, while conducting in-depth understanding and investigation of the situation, it has separately held meetings of cotton textile workers, barbers, and factory owners and managers, criticizing the illegal behavior of the capitalists. Nine representatives were elected by the workers to negotiate jointly with the capitalists. Under the principle of benefiting both labor and capital, a new contract was signed. Cotton textile workers will be paid in grain per piece from January 1. Weaving workers will generally be paid five liters of wheat per bolt of cloth. Those who weave more than 20 bolts per month will be rewarded per piece and quality. The wages of female and child workers have also been appropriately increased. It is also stipulated that wages must not be in arrears. Secondly, while increasing production, attention should be paid to improving quality and overcoming the speculative phenomenon of some capitalists who only seek profits and specialize in weaving bad cloth recently due to the rapid sales of cotton cloth. Workers should supervise this so that quality and quantity are equally improved. In addition, there are plans to specifically equip trade union cadres, organize trade unions, regularly pay attention to workers' welfare, and strengthen education on the current workers' and employee policies.

### 平遥片面维护厂主利益　严重脱离工人群众  已引起市委注意正进行纠正

　　平遥片面维护厂主利益
  　严重脱离工人群众
    已引起市委注意正进行纠正
    “什么会也开过了就是没开工人会！”
  　工人对干部提出批评
    【晋中电】平遥市领导机关片面照顾厂主，严重忽视工人利益，引起工人不满。该市自去年七月解放以来，私营工商业已获得大量恢复与发展。仅棉织业（包括织布、织毛巾、织袜等），即由解放前的十家增至一百四十三家，男女工人及学徒由一百三十六人增至一千人。但由于该市领导机关及干部对我党保护与发展工商业政策了解有片面性，误以为工人成立了工会就会刺激厂方、影响停业，不正确的贯彻劳资两利的政策，以致严重的损害了工人的利益，市内很长时间没有专作工人工作的干部，即使有些干部捎带作一些，也仅限于一般情况的了解。去年十月底曾配备了一个工会干部，但不久又调走，逐使我们和工人的关系日渐淡漠，对各行各业的领导日渐削弱，因而发生了旧行会及较大工厂以“断绝供纱”排挤新开工厂的严重现象（现已纠正）。由于没有很好的做工人工作，致使广大工人及一般劳动群众，不能很好的了解我党的工商业政策，厂主旧行会依旧过分地剥削甚至压迫工人。如棉织业行会虽改为委员会制，但许多压迫束缚工人的旧规矩实际上尚未废除，因此随便压低工资，修理机器时间也扣工资，病中要扣饭钱及打骂工人学徒等现象，仍然存在。最不合理的是在物价不断波动的情况下，工资不以实物计算（主要是织布厂），资方利用亲戚和师徒关系，或抓住工人怕失业的心理来麻痹威胁工人去忍受这些额外剥削。以织布工人为例，去年九、十月间麦价每石五、六万元（冀钞）时，每织一匹布除吃饭外赚三千元，一个工人每月可收入一石麦子；最近麦子涨至十五、六万元，工资仅增至四千元，最高者五千元，且有不少厂主不规定固定工资，拖欠三、四个月不付工资，工人催问时，则推脱说：“看大家（指其他厂）吧，反正行里有个大概”。理发工人在解放前，除吃饭外，与掌柜三七分红（工人三、掌柜七）。阎匪的一切苛捐杂税则由掌柜负担。解放后，一切苛捐杂税已废除，营业税极轻，但仍旧按三七分红，掌柜利润大大增加，工人所得不足维持生活。本月十日，九家理发馆的十七个理发工人向行会及掌柜提出增资，不仅未达到要求，行头魏贵山及陵陵堂掌柜李元反说：“我们用不起，歇着也可以！”次日理发工人们即全部停工。原在老区和石家庄的工人们懂得我党的职工政策，要求成立工会，有的批评我们的领导机关及干部说：“你们进城后什么会也开过了，就是没有开过工人会。”（按：三分区各县城普遍存在着对工人工作忽视现象，如介休理发工人也于一月十日前后因要求增资未得解决，以致停工三日。）市委对此现象已引起注意：除于十一日开理发工人会议，保证合理解决外，并将上月行署城市工作会议的精神进行了传达。连日来一面深入了解调查情况，一面分别召开棉织业、理发工人、及各厂主、掌柜会议，批评了资方的非法行为，由工人选出九个代表，与资方共同协商。在劳资两利的原则下，又订立了新合同。棉织业工人从一月一日起一律以粮食按件计价，织布工人一般织一匹布以五升麦计算，每月超过二十匹以外者，按件与质量奖励。女工童工工资也适当提高。并规定工资不得拖欠。其次，与增加产量同时，注意提高质量，克服最近因棉布销路较快，有些资方只图营利而专织坏布的投机现象。工人对此要进行监督，使质量数量同样提高。此外正计划专配备工会干部，组织工会，经常注意工人福利，并加强对当前工人职工政策的教育。
