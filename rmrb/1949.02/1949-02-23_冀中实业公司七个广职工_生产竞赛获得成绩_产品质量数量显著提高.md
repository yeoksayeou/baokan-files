　　Cultivating a New Attitude Towards Labor
  　Jizhong Industrial Company's Seven Factories
    Achieve Results in Production Competition
    Significant Improvement in Product Quality and Quantity
    [This Newspaper's Report] Under the direct leadership of the Party, government, and labor union, the winter production competition campaign in seven factories affiliated with Jizhong Industrial Company, including Jianhua Dyeing and Rolling Factory, Julong Iron Factory, Hongye Iron Factory, Dingxian Flour Mill, Chemical Factory, Leather Factory, and Yonghua Match Company, has achieved significant results.
    After a year of construction, state-owned enterprises and some public-private joint ventures in Jizhong have established unified leadership in the Party, government, and labor union work within the factories, and administrative management is initially becoming standardized. The vast number of workers have improved their class consciousness and enthusiasm for labor through study, establishing a new attitude towards labor. Coupled with the experience of Yonghua Match Company's production and conservation campaign in September, this created favorable conditions for carrying out the winter production campaign. In carrying out the production campaign, a "Three Evaluations" campaign was first launched from within the Party to outside the Party, improving the class consciousness and production enthusiasm of all Party members and workers through criticism and self-criticism. The development of the "Three Evaluations" played a decisive role in the production competition campaign. For example, in Yonghua Match Company, after Party members went through the "Three Evaluations," they recognized their shortcomings and mistakes, and truly demonstrated a vanguard role in various production activities. When all workers carried out the "Three Evaluations," Party members first made deep self-criticisms, reported their production plans, and proposed making contributions in production. This request quickly became the request of all workers, and various units automatically launched production challenge competitions, creating a surge in production. For example, the pharmacy division automatically reduced one person during the challenge, and the medicines produced maintained a quality even better than those from outside. The result of carrying out the competition not only saved manpower but also improved production efficiency. In Hongye Iron Factory, during the "Three Evaluations," workers proposed, "Our pots are not selling well because the design is not good." Everyone criticized Li Tingzhen, the sand-casting section chief who insisted on not changing the "pot mold," and production technology was improved through criticism. In Julong Iron Factory, during the "Three Evaluations," the evaluations of staff were conducted first, with worker groups sending representatives to participate, raising workers' criticisms and opinions of each staff member. In the past, some staff members did not abide by the rules and did not care about the lives of workers, but under the well-intentioned criticism of worker representatives, these issues were corrected, and factory leadership was improved. Each factory selected model workers from the "Three Evaluations," greatly increasing production enthusiasm.
    Through the winter production competition campaign, the production efficiency and quality of each factory have been significantly improved, and great results have been achieved:
    (1) On the basis of improving the class consciousness of workers, a new attitude towards labor has been established, and workers' care for the factory has been strengthened: In order to protect the machines, workers at Dingxian Flour Mill automatically stipulated a "shift handover system" at the end of shifts (day and night shifts) to report the condition of the machines and necessary precautions to the workers taking over. Zhao Guoying, a boiler trainee, wrote "Pay more attention to the water in the boiler" next to the boiler. Wang Baixiang and other nine workers at Julong Iron Factory automatically worked fifty-two hours overtime within a month. When the factory offered them overtime pay, they returned it, saying, "We worked overtime to complete the production task, not to earn a few more pounds of rice." At Yonghua Match Company, since the launch of the competition campaign, worker absenteeism and unexcused absences have decreased from 6% in the past to less than 1% now, reducing absenteeism and unexcused absences on the basis of worker awareness.
    (2) The labor union work of each factory has been newly developed, and the methods of leading production have been improved. Julong Iron Factory used the workers' congress as the core to lead all workers in carrying out the "Three Evaluations," and established a working system of mutual assistance, observation, and inspection among various worker groups, which played a great role in exchanging experiences and encouraging and supervising production at any time. The workers' union of Hongye Iron Factory participated in the competition campaign committee, and according to its own production nature, assumed responsibility for inspection, publicity, and organization in production, and so on. The leadership could revise the production plan at any time according to the workers' requests and opinions, which further improved the production leadership methods.
    (3) Under the active production of all workers, the quantity and quality of products have been significantly improved. Jianhua Dyeing and Rolling Factory dyed 40% more fabrics per month than before the launch of the production campaign; and the defective and reworked products decreased from 2.4% to 1.5%. Julong Iron Factory used to use 81 workers for one nitre-roasting pot, but now it has been reduced to only 59 workers; the defective rate of sand-casting work has decreased from 10% to 6.8%. The chemical factory increased the production of sodium sulfide from 25 barrels per furnace per day to 41 barrels; and the black base of sodium sulfide was completely eliminated from 2.2%.
    In terms of management work, on the one hand, a large amount of raw materials was purchased to overcome the difficulty of raw material shortage, and at the same time, the scope of sales of finished products was further opened up and expanded.

　　Several Experiences in the Competition
    Some experiences have been gained in the winter production competition campaign in various factories:
    (1) Improving workers' awareness and establishing a sense of ownership are the basic keys to mobilizing workers to carry out the production competition campaign: Yonghua Match Company and Jianhua Dyeing and Rolling Factory improved the class consciousness of workers politically through the "Three Evaluations" in the campaign, demonstrating the working class's high degree of care and sense of ownership for state-owned factories, and began to establish a new attitude towards labor. However, the leadership of the chemical factory and the leather factory neglected the "Three Evaluations," did not recognize that the "Three Evaluations" was a good way to mobilize all workers to get involved in the production campaign, and held the view of simply relying on economic incentives, relaxing political education. Therefore, after the production competition was proposed, the workers were very indifferent.
    (2) Absorbing workers to participate in production management and expanding the scope of democracy are the basic methods for improving factory leadership and implementing the mass line: Jianhua Dyeing and Rolling Factory absorbed a certain number of skilled workers and staff members from various production links to participate in leading the development of this campaign, and directly implemented the administrative production plans and requirements into each workshop. They also inspected the production of their own group at any time from production, and improved the leadership of production according to the workers' feedback and requirements, achieving a combination of production and management, and greatly giving play to the workers' enthusiasm and initiative. After the leather factory administratively proposed the requirement to improve quality, the production groups discussed it and bought a Continental brand leather shaft (the best local one) from the market as a sign of improving product quality, requiring the produced rear axle to "catch up with the Continental brand," which greatly improved the product quality.
    (3) In the past, when carrying out production campaigns, staff members often regarded themselves as cadres and excluded themselves from the campaign. Therefore, the development of the campaign was often a flash in the pan and could not be sustained. This campaign emphasized that staff members should play a leading role. Under the exemplary role of all staff members, this production competition campaign not only developed quickly, but also persisted. The unity among the workers became even closer.

　　树立新的劳动态度
  　冀中实业公司七个广职工
    生产竞赛获得成绩
    产品质量数量显著提高
    【本报消息】冀中实业公司所属建华染轧厂、聚隆铁工厂、宏业铁工厂、定县火磨、化学厂、皮革厂、永华火柴公司等七个工厂的冬季生产竞赛运动，在党、政及工会的直接领导下，已获得了巨大成绩。
    冀中国营企业和某些公私合营企业经过一年来的建设，工厂的党政及工会工作都树立了统一领导，行政管理初步走向正规。广大工人从学习中提高了阶级觉悟和劳动热情，树立起新的劳动态度。加之有了永华火柴公司九月份生产节约运动的经验，就造成了开展冬季生产运动的有利条件。在开展生产运动中，首先由党内到党外开展了三评运动，从批评与自我批评中提高了全体党员和职工的阶级觉悟与生产热情。三评的开展在生产竞赛运动中起了决定作用。如永华火柴公司，党员经过三评后，认识了自己的缺点错误，在各种生产中真正表现了先锋作用。在全体职工进行三评时，党员首先作了深刻检讨，报告自己的生产计划，提出在生产中立功，这个要求很快就形成了全体职工的要求，各单位自动的发起了生产挑战竞赛，造成了生产热潮。如药房股，挑战时自动减去了一个人，所制药品保持了比外来的还好。开展竞赛的结果，不但节省了人力并提高了生产效率。宏业铁工厂，在三评中工人们提出：“咱们的锅不好卖，是样子不好看。”大家批评了坚持不改“锅模子”的翻沙科长李廷珍，从批评中改进了生产技术。聚隆铁工厂，三评时先评职员，由工人小组选派代表参加，提出工人对每个职员的批评和意见。过去有的职员不遵守制度，不关心工人生活，在工人代表善意批评下，得到了纠正，改进了工厂领导，各厂都从三评中选拔了模范职工，大大提高了生产情绪。
    各厂经过冬季生产竞赛运动，生产效率和质量有了显著提高，获得了很大成绩：
    （一）在提高职工阶级觉悟的基础上，树立了新的劳动态度，加强了职工对工厂的爱护：定县火磨工人为了爱护机器，自动规定了退班时（昼夜班）向接班工人报告机器情况及应注意事项的“交班制”。锅炉学员赵国英在锅炉旁写着“要多注意锅炉的水”。聚隆铁工厂王柏祥等九个工人，一个月内自动加工五十二小时，厂方给他们加工的工资时，他们又送回去，说：“我们加工是为了完成生产任务，不是想多挣几斤米。”永华火柴公司，从开展竞赛运动以来，工人请假和旷工的由过去的百分之六，现在还不到百分之一，在工人自觉的基础上减少了请假和旷工的现象。
    （二）各厂工会工作有了新的开展，领导生产的方法有了改进。聚隆铁工厂以职工会为核心领导全体职工进行三评，并建立了各职工小组互助观摩互相检查的工作制度，在随时交换经验与互相鼓励督促生产上起了很大作用。宏业铁工厂的职工会参加了竞赛运动委员会，并根据自己的生产性质，分别担负了生产中的检查宣传和组织等工作，领导上随时可以根据职工的要求意见，改正生产计划，这就进一步改进了生产领导方法。
    （三）在全体职工的积极生产之下，产品的数量与质量都有了显著的提高。建华染轧厂每月染出布匹比开展生产运动以前增加了百分之四十；而残废、反工品则由百分之二点四减到百分之一点五。聚隆铁工厂过去一个烤硝锅用八十一个工，现在减少到只用五十九个工；翻沙活残废品由百分之十减到百分之六点八。化学厂硫化碱每炉每日由二十五桶增到四十一桶；硫化碱的黑底子，由百分之二点二作到完全没有了。
    在经营工作上，一方面大批采购了原料，克服了原料缺乏的困难，同时还更多的开辟和扩大了推销成品范围。
　　竞赛中的几点经验
    在各厂冬季生产竞赛运动中获得了一些经验：
    （一）提高工人的觉悟，树立主人翁思想是发动工人开展生产竞赛运动的基本关键：永华火柴公司和建华染轧厂在运动中通过三评，从政治上提高了职工的阶级觉悟，表现了工人阶级对国营工厂高度的爱护和主人翁的思想，开始树立了新的劳动态度。但化学工厂和皮革厂，领导上忽视了三评，没认识到三评是发动全体职工卷入生产运动的好办法，存在着单纯依靠经济刺激的观点，放松了政治教育，所以提出生产竞赛后，职工们都表现很冷淡。
    （二）吸收职工参加生产管理扩大民主范围，是改进工厂领导与贯彻群众路线的基本方法：建华染轧厂吸收了各生产环节一定数量的技术工人和职员参加领导这一运动的开展，把行政上的生产计划和要求都能直接贯彻到每个工作室里去，他们并从生产中随时检查本小组的生产成品，根据职工的反映、要求改进对生产的领导，作到了生产与管理相结合，大大发挥了职工的积极性和自觉性。皮革厂行政上提出提高质量的要求后，由各生产小组进行讨论，职工们便从市上买了一个大陆牌的皮轴来（本地最好的）作为提高产品质量的标志，要求所产后轴“向大陆牌看齐”，大大提高了产品质量。
    （三）过去开展生产运动，职员多是以干部自居，而把自己列在运动之外，因此运动的开展多是虎头蛇尾，坚持不下去。这次运动中强调提出了职员要起带头作用，在全体职员的模范作用下，使这次的生产竞赛运动不但很快开展起来，而且坚持了下去。职工间的团结也越加紧密。
