　　Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 21st: TASS reports: On February 17th, a demonstration was held in Beirut, the capital of Lebanon, to protest the Baghdad government's massacre of four Iraqi communists. The demonstrators shouted slogans such as "Down with the Sad government of Iraq! Down with British imperialism!" and threw stones at the Iraqi embassy.

　　The Iraqi government recently executed four communists who had been sentenced to fifteen years in prison. These victims were arrested in January 1947 and sentenced to death, but at that time, the Iraqi government, in view of the strong protest movements in Middle Eastern countries and around the world, had to reduce the sentences to fifteen years. Recently, these four communists were secretly "tried" on new charges of inciting riots, sentenced to death, and executed.

　　Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 21st: The World Federation of Trade Unions (WFTU) submitted a memorandum to the United Nations Economic and Social Council on the 17th regarding the frequent suppression of the basic rights of trade unions in India, Iran, and Lebanon. According to a Telepress Agency New York report, the memorandum pointed out that in India, 15,000 trade union cadres have been imprisoned. Various staff members of the All-India Trade Union Congress are being tortured in prison to force them to join the National Congress Party's reactionary leaders' puppet trade union - the National Trade Union Congress. The memorandum also stated that in Iran, martial law has been implemented in various industrial centers, and the government is using all means of terror to suppress trade union activities. This situation is also prevalent in Lebanon. Aris, one of the executive members of the WFTU and chairman of the Lebanese Trade Union Federation, was recently arrested by the Lebanese police without any stated reason. The WFTU concluded in the memorandum by requesting the United Nations Security Council to immediately take all measures to ensure the rights of trade unions in these countries.

  　黎巴嫩群众示威抗议
    世界工联抗议印度等国摧残职工会
    【新华社陕北二十一日电】塔斯社讯：二月十七日，黎巴嫩首都贝鲁特举行示威，抗议巴格达政府屠杀四位伊拉克共产党员。示威者高喊“打倒伊拉克的萨德政府！打倒英帝国主义！”的口号，并以石头投向伊拉克公使馆。
    伊拉克政府最近将四位判了十五年徒刑的共产党员处死。这批被害者于一九四七年一月被捕，并被判处死刑，但在当时，伊拉克政府鉴于中东各国与全世界强有力的抗议运动，不得不减为十五年徒刑。最近，这四位共产党员以新的煽动暴动的罪名秘密受“审”，被判死刑并被处决。
    【新华社陕北二十一日电】世界执工联盟就印度、伊朗与黎巴嫩诸国职工会基本权利经常遭受摧残一事，于十七日向联合国经济社会理事会提出备忘录一件。据电通社纽约消息，该备忘录指出：在印度一万五千名职工运动的干部，已被囚在狱中，全印职工大会的各种工作人员，在狱中受酷刑，以迫使他们参加国民大会党反动领袖的御用工会——全国职工大会。该备忘录又称：在伊朗，各工业中心实施了戒严令，政府运用一切恐怖手段镇压职工会的活动。黎巴嫩也普遍的有这种情况。世界工联的执委之一、黎巴嫩职工会联合会主席阿里斯，最近已被黎巴嫩警察逮捕，警察并未说明任何逮捕的理由。世界工联在备忘录结语中要求联合国安理会立即采取一切措施，以确保这些国家中职工会的权利。
