Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 9th. Concurrent with the overall military and political collapse of the Kuomintang reactionary traitorous government, the economy in the Kuomintang-controlled areas is also collapsing at an accelerating rate. On the 5th, the price of rice in Shanghai soared to 10,000 pseudo-Gold Yuan per shi, an increase of more than 475 times compared to the price of 21 yuan per shi on August 19 last year when the Kuomintang carried out "currency reform." If the speed of the Kuomintang's economic collapse is expressed in terms of rice price increases, then the speed in the one month and five days from New Year's Day this year has exceeded the speed from August 19 to the end of last year. In the four and a half months from August 19 to the end of last year, rice prices rose by 26 and a half times, while in the first month and five days of this year, rice prices have already risen by more than sixteen times. Due to the accelerated devaluation and loss of credibility of the pseudo-Gold Yuan, a new wave of panic buying has been set off in Shanghai. It is reported that the Gold Yuan is generally avoided, and people are trying to hoard everything they can buy. Prices of all important commodities are soaring, and many shop owners are dizzy from changing price tags, and have stopped selling goods. The credibility of the pseudo-Gold Yuan has been lost to such an extent that even the Kuomintang pseudo-local governments have expressed their unwelcome attitude. On the 4th, the Taiwan pseudo-provincial government ordered the Bank of Taiwan to immediately stop handling remittance business with other Kuomintang areas, and that all private and commercial bank funds could no longer be remitted to Taiwan. Xue Yue, chairman of the Guangdong pseudo-provincial government, openly declared at a reception for journalists that he would restrict the southward flow of pseudo-Gold Yuan. According to Hong Kong's Hua Shang Bao, the South China pseudo-government has decided to issue a "new currency" for the four provinces of South China, and has commissioned the Hong Kong China Bookstore to print it.

　　与军事政治总崩溃同时
  　敌区经济加速崩溃
    一月米价上涨达十六倍
    【新华社陕北九日电】和国民党反动卖国政府在军事上、政治上的总崩溃同时，国民党统治区的经济也在加速度地崩溃着。上海大米五日已涨达每石售伪金圆券一万元，较去年八月十九日国民党“币制改革”时的每石售价二十一元，已涨高了四百七十五倍多。国民党的经济崩溃的速度，如以米价的上涨来表示，那么今年元旦至现在一个多月的速度又超过了去年八月十九日至去年年底的速度。去年八月十九日至年底的四个多月中，米价上涨了二十六倍半，而今年头一个月零五天中，米价就已上涨了十六倍多。由于伪金圆券的加速贬值和丧失信用，上海又掀起了新的抢购风潮。据息：金圆券普遍地被人回避，人民正在试图购存一切能够买得的东西。一切重要商品价格都在飞涨，许多商店老板为改变价格标签弄得头昏眼花，遂停止售货。伪金圆券的信用已丧失到这种程度，甚至国民党伪地方政府也表示不欢迎态度。台湾伪省政府四日饬令台湾银行即日停止办理其他国民党区汇款业务，今后一切私人及商业银行款项均不能汇台。广东伪省政府主席薛岳，在招待新闻记者时，公开宣称要限制伪金圆券南汇。据香港华商报消息：华南伪政府已决定发行华南四省“新币”，并已由香港中华书局承印。
