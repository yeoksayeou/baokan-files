To the Offices and Correspondents of the Counties of Taihang and North Yue:

　　We commend your recent reports on the winter production activities and achievements. At present, we hope that everyone will specifically summarize and report on the experiences in leading and organizing winter production since the beginning of winter, especially the experiences in combining labor, technology, and capital in sideline and handicraft production. We also hope to see more reports on the progress of cooperative activities in various counties since the organization of winter production and the role of cooperatives in organizing winter production. If any county has recently conducted winter production inspections and summaries, please send them to us.

　　To Comrade Yu Taihang of the Liaison Section and the Offices of the Ping Shun and Huguan County Committees, and Comrades Xing Wen, Xiao Cheng, Liang, Zhi Xian, etc.:

　　Please report on the activities of heroes and model figures such as Li Shun Da and Xiang Ti Shui since the conclusion of land reform, party rectification, and winter production work.

　　To All Teachers and Students of Wu'an Fourth High School's Liaison Section:

　　The consolation money you sent to the frontline soldiers has been received. We have transferred this amount to the Political Department of the North China Military Region, asking them to forward it to the front.

　　To Comrade Su Shirui of the Duli Coal Mine in Anyang:

　　Regarding the issue you wrote about concerning the mine occupying the village farmers' association land, which has already been purchased with rice but for which no formal contract has been established, we have sent a letter to the Anyang County Committee asking them to resolve it quickly.

　　To Comrade Li Xiu, a retired soldier of Xiatun Village, Sixth District, Neiqiu:

　　Regarding your request for a production loan to subsidize your livelihood, we have sent a letter to the Civil Affairs Section of your county asking them to help you resolve it.

　　To Comrade Li Shaoshun and other teachers of Guzhang, Fourth District, Lucheng:

　　If what you wrote about regarding Lu Xiuying of Guzhang mistreating her stepchild to death is true, she should be punished by government law. It is illegal for the village cadres to tie up Lu Xiuying with weapons, and it is even more wrong for the village cadres to feast at Lu Xiuying's home for a day. We have forwarded this matter to the Lucheng County Government for handling.

　　To Comrade Qingkui of the Lian She of Lingchuan County:

　　Regarding the failure of Xida Town, Fourth District, Changzhi, to properly resettle the demobilized soldier Comrade Cui, we have sent a letter to the Changzhi County Government asking them to promptly inspect and properly arrange the resettlement.
