Xinhua News Agency, Tianjin, 7th. The Tianjin Municipal People's Government and cadres from various districts warmly visited the families of revolutionary martyrs, revolutionary soldiers, and impoverished revolutionary cadres during the Spring Festival. Before the Spring Festival, the municipal government notified the district governments to promptly investigate the names, addresses, and living conditions of the families of martyrs, soldiers, and cadres in their respective districts. The city's 470 impoverished families of martyrs, soldiers, and cadres, totaling more than 2,300 people, were each given two catties of white flour and one catty of meat. On the first day of the Lunar New Year, cadres from various districts went to the homes of martyrs, soldiers, and cadres to offer New Year greetings. Huang Jing, the mayor of the People's Municipal Government, also sent many New Year cards to the families and expressed his condolences. The families of martyrs, soldiers, and cadres were very happy to see the mayor's New Year cards and the district cadres visiting. Pang Shengtian from Shaanxi Road in the First District felt that it was rare for the mayor to visit ordinary people for the New Year. He said, "The world is really different. I have never seen an 'official' offering New Year greetings to the people. It is truly a people's government in name and in fact!"

　　津市人民政府
  　慰问革命家属
    【新华社天津七日电】天津市人民政府及各区干部，春节中热烈慰问革命烈士、革命军人和贫苦革命干部的家属。春节前市政府即通知各区政府，迅即调查各该区烈军干属的姓名、住址及生活情况。全市贫苦烈军干属四百七十户，二千三百余人，每人均发给白面二斤、肉一斤。旧历元旦日，各区干部分赴烈、军、干属家拜年。人民市政府黄敬市长并发出很多贺年片给各该家属，并致慰问。烈军干属们见到市长的贺年片和区干部来拜年，都非常喜欢。一区陕西路庞生田觉得市长给老百姓来拜年，真是稀罕事，他说：“世道真两样，向来没见过‘官’给民拜年，真是名符其实的人民政府！”
