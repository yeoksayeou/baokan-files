[JiZhong Electric] Botou Tongfeng Private Iron Factory's owner, Dai Pengyun, excessively exploits workers and adopts divisive control measures, seriously infringing on workers' welfare. Dai Pengyun does not specify concrete figures for workers' wages, deceiving them with words like "If the factory makes money, no one will lose out," and fails to implement a reasonable in-kind wage system that benefits both labor and capital. Due to low wages, most workers cannot maintain their livelihoods. When workers get sick, they are not allowed to rest if the illness is minor, and if it is severe, they are sent home, with the factory not covering medical expenses. When worker Wang Chenhai fell ill, he rested at home for more than twenty days, and the factory did not even inquire about him. Workers are also required to provide their own towels and soap for daily use in the factory. These unreasonable exploitations greatly affect workers' production morale. He also uses tactics of co-option and bribery to buy off Zhang Xiuting, the director of the factory's trade union. In addition to paying Zhang his due wages each month, he also gives him a special manpower share, inviting him to the factory director's office every day for lavish meals. Anyone who is dissatisfied with Zhang Xiuting is fired from the factory to threaten workers. He also gives Zhang Xiuting various "special rights" to "inspect" workers' production and "supervise" workers' actions, attempting to control workers' legitimate activities and democratic rights. Every day before dawn, he urges workers to go to work from his bed, extending working hours without limit. Zhang Xiuting, who is completely detached from the worker masses, has become Dai Pengyun's agent. Workers submitted a request for resolution to the Municipal Federation of Trade Unions, which then rectified and assisted the factory's trade union organization. All workers unanimously dismissed union director Zhang Xiuting, re-elected union cadres, and are preparing to fully discuss all issues with the factory to seek a reasonable solution.

　　泊头同丰铁厂侵犯工人福利
  　职工会正积极纠正
    【冀中电】泊头同丰私营铁工厂，厂主戴朋云过分剥削工人，对工人采取分裂控制手段，严重的侵犯了工人福利。戴朋云对工人的工资不规定出具体数目，用“工厂赚了钱，谁也吃不了亏”等话来欺骗工人，不实行合理的符合劳资两利的实物工资制。由于工资低，致使大部工人不能维持生活。工人有了病，轻的不让休息，重的送回家去，医药费厂里不管。工人王臣海病了，就在家里养了二十多天，厂方连问都没问。工人在厂里日常用的手巾、肥皂也都叫工人自备。这些不合理的剥削，大大影响了工人的生产情绪。他并利用了拉拢利诱的手段收买本厂工会主任张秀廷，每月除发给张应得的工资外，并特给他一个人力股，天天请他到厂长室去大吃大喝，谁对张秀廷不满，就把他开除出厂，来威胁工人。并给予张秀廷“检查”工人生产，“监督”工人行动的各种“特权”，企图以此控制工人的正当活动和民主权利。每天不到天明，他就在被窝里督促工人上工，无限制的延长工作时间。完全脱离工人群众的张秀廷，便成了戴朋云的代理人。工人向市职工会提出要求解决，市工会遂整顿帮助了该厂工会组织。全体工人一致罢免了工会主任张秀廷，重新举选了工会干部，并准备把全部问题，很好与厂方协商，求得合理解决。
