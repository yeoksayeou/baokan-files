　　The Growth of a Forest School
    Wang Kongwen
    In June of last year, the Department of Botany of the North China University Agricultural College decided to move to the Taiyue Forest Region to establish a school to cultivate specialized forestry technical personnel. At the time, there were only two teachers and five students. They were determined to transform an old, dilapidated temple in the deep mountains into a place for studying science, and to use some of the temple's altar tables and incense burners as desks and furniture. Under the personal leadership of the teachers, everyone set to work. Their tireless work, and the gradual increase in the number of students (how many—Editor), finally led to the successful completion of the construction of 110 rooms in two months. The school held its opening ceremony on August 8th.

    The teaching system is carried out in accordance with President Le's proposed "education, research, and production" trinity approach. The courses include specialized knowledge of botany, physics and chemistry, forest essentials, timber, dry distillation, mensuration, and medicinal plants. It is stipulated that half the day is spent in class and half the day is spent in practice. Two factories, timber dry distillation and winemaking, were established as experimental sites for combining theoretical learning with practical application. In the course of four months, more than twenty batches of softwood and hardwood have been dry-distilled, rosin and turpentine have been trial-produced, and winemaking with wild fruits from the mountains has been successful and is planned to be vigorously promoted to reduce the consumption of grain for winemaking. During the learning process, three campaigns were carried out: namely, digging for medicinal herbs, building factories, and winter stockpiling. In the digging for medicinal herbs, the medicinal plant course was coordinated with the internship, and the teachers personally led the students to provide guidance at any time. There was a period when they felt that medicinal materials were difficult to obtain. After research, they decided to regularly have specialists take turns searching for them. This not only solved the source of medicinal materials (a total of more than 4,000 catties of medicinal materials were dug out), but also learned organizational work. During the internship, more than 11,500 trees were measured, more than 3,600 trees were pruned, and walnuts were experimentally planted. At the same time, due to the difficulty of vegetables in the mountains in winter, they reclaimed wasteland to grow vegetables, and cut nearly 40,000 catties of firewood, and cultivated 32 mu of land, preparing for large-scale production this year.

    Because there were few administrative staff, at the beginning of the school's establishment, the students organized a central group to assist in building the school and were responsible for managing food, books, purchasing, storage, and other tasks. After the school officially started classes, the central group was re-elected to form a student union, which led the study and created two types of wall newspapers, "Forest Light Bi-Monthly" and "Loose-leaf," to organize collective research. For example, in the digging of medicinal herbs, due to two different leadership methods, two different effects were produced, and a discussion was launched on the wall newspaper. Finally, the correct conclusion was drawn and the work was improved.

    Due to adhering to the "education, research, and production" trinity school-building policy, and giving full play to the spirit of the teachers and students jointly managing school affairs, this only forestry specialized school in North China is now growing up in constant hard struggle.

　　一座森林学校的成长
    王孔文
    去年六月，华北大学农学院的植物系，决定迁往太岳林区创办学校，培养林业专门技术人材，当时只有两个教员和五个学生。他们决心把深山里年久失修的古庙，改造成为学习科学的处所，把庙里的一些神桌香案拼成书桌用具，在教员亲自带领下大家动起手来。他们不歇的工作，学生也陆续增多（有多少——编者），终于在两个月的时间内，胜利地完成了一百一十间房舍的修筑工程，学校于八月八日举行了开学典礼。
    教学制度是按照乐院长所提出的“教育、研究、生产”三位一体的方针进行的。课程有植物、理化、森林大意、木材、干溜、测树、药用植物等专门知识。规定半天上课，半天实习。建立了木材干溜和制酒二厂作为学习理论与实际结合的试验处所。四个月的时间已干溜了软硬木二十余锅，试制了松香、松节油，并以山中野果酿酒获得成功，且计划大力推广，以减少粮食酿酒的消耗。在学习中则进行了三个运动：即挖药、建厂、冬囤。在挖药中，配合实习上了药用植物课，教员并亲自带领学生以便随时指导。曾有一个时期他们感到药材困难，研究结果，决定经常由专人轮流寻找，这样不但解决了药材的来源（共挖出了药材四千余斤），还学会了组织工作。在实习中共测树一万一千五百余株，修树三千六百余株，实验种植了胡桃。同时，因冬季山中菜蔬困难，自己开荒种菜，并砍了烧柴近四万斤，耕地三十二亩，准备今年大生产。
    因为行政工作人员少，学校创办初始，学生们即组织了中心小组，辅助建校，负责管理伙食、图书、采买、保管等工作。学校正式开课后，中心小组经改选成立了学生会，领导学习，创办了“林光半月刊”、“活页”两种壁报，借以组织集体研究。如在挖药中由于两种不同领导方法，而产生了两种不同效果，便在壁报上展开讨论，最后得出了正确结论，改进了工作。
    由于坚持了“教育、研究、生产”三位一体的建校方针，发挥了师生共同治理校务的事业精神，现在这座华北唯一的林业专门学校，便在不断的艰苦斗争中成长起来了。
