Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 4th. Okamura Neji, the top Japanese war criminal who was declared innocent and released by the Nanjing Kuomintang traitorous government under the orders of MacArthur and Chiang Kai-shek, is one of the mortal enemies of the Chinese nation. His history is inextricably linked to the nearly thirty years of Japanese imperialism's invasion of China. Okamura's first position after graduating from the Japanese Army University was as a member of the China Section of the Japanese General Staff Headquarters, later rising to become the head of the China Section. During World War I, he participated in the occupation of Qingdao. During the First Revolutionary Civil War in China from 1925 to 1927, he served as a military advisor to Sun Chuanfang. In 1928, he served as the commander of the 6th Infantry Regiment and participated in the occupation of Jinan, and was one of the executioners of the "May 3rd" Massacre. In the "January 28th" war of aggression against China in 1932, he served as the Deputy Chief of Staff of the Japanese Army in Shanghai. Later, he was promoted to Deputy Chief of Staff of the Japanese Kwantung Army and concurrently as the military attache to the Japanese Embassy in the puppet Manchukuo, and planned the Japanese invasion of Rehe in the same year. In 1933, he represented the Japanese government and signed the "Tanggu Agreement" with the Kuomintang traitorous government, which invaded eastern Hebei and the area north of the Great Wall. In 1934, he was promoted to the Second Department Chief of the Japanese General Staff Headquarters. In 1935, he collaborated with the commander of the Japanese Army in North China, Umezu, and He Yingqin to sign the "He-Umezu Agreement" that invaded North China. After Japan launched a large-scale offensive against China in 1937, he served as the commander of the North China Battlefield Corps, and led his troops to participate in the attack on Xuzhou, and was the first to invade Hankou. In July 1940, he was promoted to Commander-in-Chief of the Japanese North China Expeditionary Army, until August 1944. During this period, Okamura reached the peak of his barbarous slaughter of the Chinese people. The most representative of his barbarity was the "Three Alls Policy" of burning all, killing all, and looting all, which he invented. In August 1944, he was transferred to Commander-in-Chief of the Japanese Central China and South China Expeditionary Army, and planned and commanded the Japanese army to invade Hubei, Hunan, Guangdong, Guangxi, and Guizhou from Henan, causing enormous losses of life and property to the people of six provinces. In November of the same year, he was promoted to Commander-in-Chief of the Japanese China Expeditionary Army. After Japan surrendered in August 1945, Okamura refused to surrender to the Chinese People's Liberation Army and continued to participate in the offensive against the Chinese People's Liberation Areas under the command of the US military and Chiang Kai-shek. Precisely because he was so vicious to the Chinese people, Okamura had been regarded as a guest of honor and an advisor to the counter-revolutionary civil war by Chiang Kai-shek for three years since Japan's surrender, until a symbolic "trial" was held last August. On January 26th of this year, the Nanjing Kuomintang traitorous government's Ministry of National Defense War Criminals Military Tribunal held a retrial, and the presiding judge, Shi Meiyu, declared Okamura "innocent." In response to this infamous and sinful "trial," the spokesperson of the Chinese Communist Party issued a serious warning to the Nanjing Kuomintang traitorous government on January 28th, ordering it to immediately re-arrest Okamura and prepare to escort him to the Chinese People's Liberation Army. However, the Nanjing traitors, devoid of conscience and recognizing thieves as fathers, were determined to continue to obey foreign imperialism and refused to obey the Chinese people, and on January 31st, they sent this Japanese butcher, stained with the blood of the Chinese people, and 260 other Japanese war criminals back to Japan on the American ship John Wilkes.

　　冈村宁次染满中国人民鲜血
  　南京卖国贼们毫无心肝竟纵其逃逸
    【新华社陕北四日电】被南京国民党卖国政府奉麦克阿瑟与蒋介石之命宣判无罪并释放回国的日本首要侵华战犯冈村宁次，是中华民族的死敌之一。他的历史是和日本帝国主义近三十余年对于中国的侵略史分不开的。冈村在日本陆军大学毕业后的第一个职务，就是日本参谋本部中国班的班员，以后历升为中国课课长。在第一次世界大战中，曾参加占领青岛。在一九二五年至一九二七年的中国现代第一次革命战争中，曾任孙传芳的军事顾问。一九二八年任步兵第六联队长，参加占领济南，是“五三”惨案的刽子手之一。一九三二年“一二八”的侵华战争中，任上海日军副参谋长。后升任日本关东军副参谋长兼驻伪满大使馆武官，曾策划同年日寇进攻热河的战争。一九三三年代表日本政府与国民党卖国政府签订侵略冀东及长城以北的“塘沽协定”。一九三四年，升任日本参谋本部第二部长。一九三五年，协同华北日军司令梅津与何应钦签订侵略华北的“何梅协定”。一九三七年日本对中国举行大规模进攻后，任华北战地兵团长，曾率兵参与攻入徐州，并首先攻入汉口。一九四零年七月升任日本华北派遣军总司令，直至一九四四年八月，在此期间，冈村达到了野蛮地残杀中国人民的顶点。最足以代表他的野蛮的就是他所发明的烧光、杀光、抢光的“三光政策”。一九四四年八月调任日本华中、华南派遣军总司令，曾策划并指挥日军自河南攻入湖北、湖南、广东、广西直至贵州，造成六省人民生命财产的浩大损失。同年十一月，升任日本的中国派遣军总司令。一九四五年八月日本投降，冈村拒绝向中国人民解放军投降，并继续参加由美军和蒋介石所指挥的对于中国人民解放区的进攻。正因为对于中国人民如此穷凶极恶，冈村在日本投降以来三年中一直被蒋介石奉为上宾和反革命内战的顾问，直到去年八月才举行了一次象征式的“审讯”。今年一月二十六日，南京国民党卖国政府国防部审判战犯军事法庭举行复审，由该庭庭长石美瑜宣判冈村“无罪”。针对着这个遗臭万年的罪恶“审判”，中国共产党发言人于一月二十八日向南京国民党卖国政府提出严重警告，令其立即将冈村重行逮捕，准备押送中国人民解放军。但是毫无心肝、认贼作父的南京卖国贼们，决心继续听命于外国帝国主义而拒绝听命于中国人民，竟于一月三十一日遣送这个染满中国人民鲜血的日本屠夫以及其他日本战犯二百六十名乘美国轮船约翰威克斯号返回日本。
