[Hebei Central News] Impoverished women in Baoding City mostly relied on needlework, spinning thread, knitting, washing clothes, sewing socks, making insoles, or running small businesses to make a living in the past. Before liberation, due to the Kuomintang bandit army's various oppressions and extortions, many handicraftsmen and small factories could not survive, leading to closures and bankruptcies, causing most impoverished women to lose their jobs and face very difficult lives. After the liberation of Baoding City, with the active help and leadership of the Military Control Commission, the People's Democratic Government, and the Hebei Central Women's Federation Office in Baoding, through relief, work-for-relief, and loans to organize production, in the past two months, many impoverished women have organized and engaged in production, and their livelihood problems have been initially resolved.

　　When mobilizing impoverished citizens to dismantle enemy bunkers through work-for-relief, some women actively participated in this work. According to incomplete statistics from eight streets, 62 women participated. Many of them worked no less hard than men. In 32nd Street alone, 32 women have been organized to paste matchboxes. In the Second District, eighteen women formed four knitting and spinning groups, each person spinning ten yards of thread per day (each yard costing 1.5 New Currency). In the First and Second Districts, seventy women were organized to make insoles (each pair fetching 1.5 jin of rice). According to incomplete statistics from the First, Second, and Fourth Districts, among the 241 people organized to boil saltpeter, 29 women participated in the saltpeter boiling group, and 81 women formed spinning groups, selling the spun thread to towel factories or production promotion agencies. In the Fourth District, 73 impoverished women from four streets sewed sacks for the Dasheng Grain Store and granaries, each person sewing 30 sacks per day, each sack fetching 1.5 yuan. Some left early in the morning with dry rations and did not return until dark. In the Fourth District, 47th Street, four elderly women were organized to collect pig and sheep bones, collecting more than 2,000 jin in the past two months, selling them for 70 Border Region currency. Other women sewed socks and made combs. In general, they have initially stood on their own feet in terms of economic life.

　　Combined with the organization of production, education has been strengthened, and their political awareness has also been raised. In the work of democratic governance, many women have been elected as group leaders or deputy group leaders and have participated in the work of democratic governance. Among the 67 group leaders elected from ten streets in the Second District, 27 are women.

　　In the past two months, Baoding City has gained the following experiences in organizing the production of impoverished women:

　　(1) Organize various productions based on the masses' existing production foundation, tools, technology, and their different requirements. For example, Wang Si's family in 32nd Street had the skills and tools for spinning thread, but when asked to make insoles, she said: "My eyes are blurry, and I don't have the strength in my hands, so I can't make them well." She expressed unwillingness to make them. Later, when she heard about organizing spinning, she was very happy and moved out her spinning wheel, and at the same time, she automatically went around looking for people who could spin thread to form two spinning groups.

　　(2) Start with small things and try to solve the livelihood problems of impoverished citizens from all aspects. For example, after a "drum beater" in 26th Street was rescued, he picked up manure in the morning, went to the streets and alleys to "beat the drum" after breakfast, his wife did work for others at home, and the two children picked up coal cinders or waste paper. The whole family was mobilized, and the livelihood difficulties were solved.

　　(3) Organizing citizens' production should be closely linked with production and economic departments. For example, sewing sacks for the Dasheng Grain Store and granaries, contacting and negotiating with various agencies in Hebei Central to make shoes and weave cloth, etc.

　　(4) Do not introduce and subjectively organize production methods that are not guaranteed to the masses. In 32nd Street, Second District, the masses were organized to make single-layer clothing, but later it didn't work, which made the masses very disappointed, and their production enthusiasm declined.

　　保定市贫苦妇女
  　组织起来投入生产
    【冀中讯】保定市一般贫苦妇女，过去多靠做针线活、落线、打＠子、洗衣服、缝袜子、纳底子、打夹纸，或经营小商贩等维持生活。解放前由于国民党匪军百般压榨勒索，致使一些手工业者、小工厂等多不能维持，以致停业倒闭，使大部贫苦妇女失业，生活非常困难。保定市解放后，在军管会人民民主政府和冀中妇联驻保办事处的积极帮助与领导下，经过赈济，以工代赈与贷款组织生产，至今两个月来，已有不少贫苦妇女纷纷组织起来投入生产，生活问题达到初步解决。
    在以工代赈发动贫苦市民拆毁敌人碉堡时，有些妇女也积极参加了这个工作。据八个街不完整的统计，参加的妇女就有六十二名。她们很多干起活来，比男人并不少。已组织起来糊洋火盒的妇女光卅二街就有卅二名。二区十八个妇女组成了四个打＠子落线组，每天每人可落十码线（每码新币一元五角）。一、二两区组织起来纳底子的妇女七十个（每纳一双一斤半米）。据一、二、四三个区不完整的统计，在组织起来熬硝的二百四十一人中就有廿九个妇女参加了熬硝组，还有八十一个妇女，分别组成了纺线组，把纺成的线卖给毛巾工厂或生产推进社。四区四个街七十三个贫苦妇女给大生粮店和粮库缝麻袋，每人每天可缝三十条，每条一元五角。有的一早带着干粮去，直到天黑才回家。四区四十七街，组织了四个老太太拾猪羊骨头，两个月来已拾了两千多斤，卖了边币七十元。还有的妇女缝袜子、勒篦子等。总起来说，她们在经济生活上，已经初步的站立起来了。
    结合组织生产，并加强了对她们的教育，因此政治觉悟也提高了。在民主建政工作中，很多妇女被选为组长或副组长，参加了民主建政工作。二区十个街选出的六十七名组长中，有二十七名是妇女。
    两月来保市在组织贫苦妇女生产中，获得了以下几个经验：
    （一）根据群众旧有的生产基础、工具、技术和她们的不同要求，来组织各种生产。如三十二街王司氏，有落线的手艺和工具，让她们纳底子，她说：“眼睛花了，没有手劲，纳不好。”表示不愿纳。后来一说组织落线，她很高兴，把她的落线车子搬出来；同时自动的到处找会落线的人组成了两个落线组。
    （二）由点滴入手，从各方面想法解决贫苦市民的生活问题。如二十六街一个“打鼓”的被救济以后，早晨拾粪，吃过早饭到大街小巷去“打鼓”，妻子在家中给人家做活，两个孩子拾煤核或烂纸，全家都活动起来，生活困难就解决了。
    （三）组织市民生产要和生产与经济部门取得密切联系。如给大生粮店和粮库缝麻袋，给冀中各个机关联系交涉做鞋织布等。
    （四）没有把握的生产办法，不要给群众介绍和主观的去组织。二区三十二街，组织群众做单衣，到后来不行了，使群众很失望，生产情绪低落。
