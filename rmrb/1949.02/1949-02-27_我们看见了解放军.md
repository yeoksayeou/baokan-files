　　We Saw the People's Liberation Army
　　Qinghua University Students Collective Creation
　　On December 13th, we heard the sound of cannons.

　　The sound of cannons came from Qinghe Town, near the north of our school. That afternoon, all the teachers and students in the school immediately organized and established an institution to defend the campus, and sent out pickets to stand guard all around the campus.

　　By the evening, we learned that the People's Liberation Army had reached Dashiqiao, a village more than two miles away from Tsinghua.

　　We heard a story that moved us deeply: When the People's Liberation Army advanced towards our school that night, they discovered that we were within their artillery range, so they immediately stopped firing. At Yuanmingyuan, they fought hand-to-hand with the Kuomintang army with bayonets, and more than 300 people were sacrificed. Later, when we went out and saw the sand and soil of Yuanmingyuan stained with blood, we knew it was shed for us, and we really wanted to cry.

　　That night, the People's Liberation Army detoured to the west of our school and advanced along the Western Hills. We heard the sound of cannons gradually die down.

　　That very night, the Kuomintang artillery insisted on coming into our school and setting up cannons on our dormitories. The school negotiated with them for a long time before they agreed to set up artillery positions in the open space in front of the school's Chemistry Building. The pits had already been dug, but later, seeing that they really couldn't beat the People's Liberation Army, they hurriedly fled to the city with the other troops, running for their lives. They fled all day the next day.

　　After a night of deathly silence, Tsinghua Garden was liberated. The next day, we saw the People's Liberation Army we had been waiting for day and night.

　　At first, a few bold students secretly peeked outside the school gate, and then went straight towards Yuquan Mountain. There, they found a command post of the People's Liberation Army. They saw how enthusiastically the local people welcomed the People's Liberation Army, and heard the speeches of the People's Liberation Army. After they came back, they wrote a wall newspaper called "A Trip to Yuquan Mountain" and posted it in front of the dining hall. Many students lined up to read it and were extremely happy. A large number of students went out to talk to the People's Liberation Army.

　　These People's Liberation Army soldiers were all from the Northeast. Before they had even rested, they were chatting warmly with the people of Haidian and Chengfu and our students, and they even insisted on treating us to meals. The people were all smiling, saying "Thank goodness" repeatedly. They said, "It would have been so much better if the Eighth Route Army had come earlier." They also said that there had never been such good soldiers, "Not only do they not beat or scold people or steal things, but they also sweep your yard and fetch water for you. If they borrow something, they must return it, and if they break something, they must compensate for it." Some old men said, "I've lived so long, and I've finally figured out the truth." They actually saw the "strange thing" of the people and the soldiers scrambling to clean up the room and sweep the floor, being polite and courteous to each other.

　　The students also heard every soldier of the People's Liberation Army explain the political and military situation to them. They also told the students about their previous experiences of being treated like beasts of burden under the rule of the Kuomintang. They said: Our war is to let our people turn over and become masters. Even a small soldier can speak a set of political theories, and we college students are dumbfounded and admire them immensely.

　　The students were also deeply moved by the spirit of hard work and endurance of the People's Liberation Army. The students said, "You eat really bitterly," and they said: "What the people eat, we eat; before production is greatly developed, if we eat well, the people will eat badly. We are the people's army, fighting for the people, it is impossible to thin the people and fatten ourselves."

　　When we left them to return to school, we held their hands tightly. We never had any good feelings towards soldiers, but that day, we really wanted to follow them. We seemed to be connected to them by something. No, we were originally the same kind of people, people who were forced by the Chiang Kai-shek bandit gang to live a hard life, but they risked their lives to pick up weapons to fight a way out for everyone.

　　A week later, under the protection of the People's Liberation Army, we were preparing to resume classes, but two days before the resumption of classes, such an unexpected thing happened: On the evening of the 19th, a Kuomintang plane flew over Tsinghua Garden, circled a few times, and dropped bombs. The students did not expect at all that our place would become a bombing target. At that time, most of the students were eating in the dining hall. When they heard the sound of the plane, they all panicked and hid. On the cold and wet ground, they gritted their teeth and clenched their fists, watching out the window with hatred. The plane dropped nine bombs in a row, six of which landed in our school.

　　Afterwards, the students were all preparing to go to the city to serve, because Beiping was about to be liberated, and many problems in the city needed to be solved, and our students were needed to help solve them. We were also very eager to see the students in the city, so everyone was very nervously organized and prepared. We established a Welcome Liberation People's Service Committee, and divided all the students into five detachments, each detachment with six or seven companies, and each company with three platoons. There were about 1,800 to 1,900 students in our school, and 1,821 students participated in the work, accounting for more than 95% of the total number of students.

　　Each platoon began to study the New Democracy, various policies, and the issue of the transformation of intellectuals. Because we know that after liberation, the entire society will be fundamentally changed, and we will become people in a new society. We must first understand this new society so that we will not go astray or fall behind.

　　Students who didn't like to move before have started to move, and students who didn't like to be with other students before now find that there is endless fun in collective life. Some who previously doubted the Communist Party and the People's Liberation Army are now awake; students who couldn't endure hardship before now know that the world has changed, and we are supported by hard-working workers and peasants, and we should not demand too much enjoyment from them. One student ran to the countryside near Tsinghua and saw that the peasants were living a hard life, and also learned that the cost of one of our publicly funded students would be borne by three middle peasants. After he came back, he resolutely said: "I must eat millet next month!"

　　Our students are changing slowly like this...

　　我们看见了解放军
  　清华大学学生集体创作
    在十二月十三日，我们听到了炮声。
    炮声是在我们学校北面清河镇附近发出来的。那天下午全校老师同学就立刻组织起来，成立了防卫校园的机构，派出了纠察队在校园四处站岗。
    到晚上我们知道，解放军已经打到距离清华两里多路的村庄大石桥。
    我们听到一个使我们极端感动的故事：当晚解放军向我们学校前进的时候，他们发现我们已在他们炮火的射程以内时，就立即停止发炮，在圆明园他们用刺刀和国民党的军队肉搏起来，因此牺牲了三百多人，我们后来出去看到圆明园砂土上染满了鲜血，我们知道那是为我们而流的，我们真要痛哭一场。
    那天晚上，解放军就绕到我们学校的西边，沿西山一带转进了，我们听到炮声渐渐地沉寂下来。
    就在这天晚上，国民党的炮兵就硬要到我们学校里面来，要在我们的宿舍上架炮。学校和他们交涉半天，他们才答应在学校化学馆前的空地上设炮位，坑已挖好了，后来看着实在打不过解放军，才急急忙忙和其他的部队没命地向城里逃，第二天逃了一整天。
    渡过了死一样沉寂的一夜，清华园解放了。第二天我们就看到了日夜盼望的解放军。
    最初是几个大胆的同学偷偷地到校门外张望，后来就一直朝玉泉山方面走去了。在那边，他们找到了解放军的一个指挥部，他们看到了当地老百姓怎样狂热地欢迎解放军，听到了解放军的讲话，他们回来以后就写了一篇“玉泉山之行”的壁报贴在饭厅前，好多同学排成队去看，都高兴得不得了。大规模出去和解放军谈心。
    这些解放军都是东北来的，累还没有歇过来，就和海甸、成府的老百姓和我们同学亲亲热热地聊天，还硬要招待我们吃饭。老百姓都满脸笑容，口里连说“谢天谢地”，他们说“八路军要是早来一点多好”，他们又说，从来没有这样的好兵，“不但不打骂人不抢东西，相反地还替你打扫院子挑水，借了东西一定要还，坏了东西还一定要赔。”有些老头子说“活了这么久，倒活出个道理来了。”他们居然亲眼看到老百姓和当兵的抢着收拾房间扫地，互相客气礼让的“怪事”。
    同学们还听到每一个解放军给他们讲解政治军事形势。他们还向同学们说出他们以前在国民党统治底下做牛做马的简历，他们说：咱们打仗就是为了咱们人民大众翻身做主人。他们就是一个小兵，也会说出一套一套政治理论，我们这些大学生目瞪口呆，佩服得五体投地。
    同学们还深深地为解放军刻苦耐劳的精神所感动，同学们说“你们吃得真苦”，他们就说：“人民吃啥我们就吃啥；在生产未有大发展前，我们吃得好，人民就吃得坏了，我们是人民的军队，为老百姓打天下，不可能瘦了老百姓，肥了自家”。
    我们离开他们回学校去时，紧紧地握着他们的手，我们从来都是对士兵没有什么好感的，到那天，我们却真想跟着他们走，我们跟他们好象有什么东西牵连在一起，不，我们和他们本来就是同一种人，被蒋介石匪帮迫得过苦日子的人，可是他们拼了命拿起武器来为大家打出一条生路。
    一个礼拜以后，我们在解放军的保护下，准备复课了，可是在复课前两天，却发生了这样的一回意外事：在十九日傍晚，清华园上空飞来了一架国民党飞机，绕了几个圈子以后，掉下炸弹来，同学们完全没有料到，我们这个地方也会成为轰炸目标，那时大部分同学在饭厅里吃饭，听到飞机声就都慌忙躲避起来。在又冷又湿的地上咬着牙齿，捏着拳头痛恨地看望窗外，那飞机一连丢下了九个炸弹，六个落在我们学校内。
    以后同学就全都准备进城服务，因为北平快要解放了、城里好多问题要解决，而且要我们同学帮忙解决，我们也非常渴望见到城里同学，于是大家都非常紧张地组织起来，准备起来，我们成立了一个迎接解放人民服务委员会，把全校同学编成五个大队，每个大队六七个中队，每个中队三个小队。我们全校同学大概有一千八九百人，参加工作的同学有一千八百二十一个人，占全校人数百分之九十五以上。
    每个小队都开始忙着学习新民主主义，各项政策，和知识分子改造的问题。因为我们知道，解放以后，整个社会就会从根本上改变过来，我们就会成为一个新社会里的人，我们一定得先了解这个新社会，才不会走歧路，才不会落伍。
    以前不爱动的同学都动起来了，以前不爱和同学在一起的，现在发现集体生活中有着无穷的乐趣，有些以前对共产党对解放军怀疑的，现在都清醒了；以前吃不了苦的同学现在都知道世界变了，我们是靠劳苦的工人与农民养活的，我们不该向他们要求太高的享受。有一位同学跑到清华附近的乡下，看到农民过着苦日子，还知道我们一个公费生的费用要三个中农来负担。他回来以后，坚决地说：“下一个月非吃小米不可！”
    我们同学就是这样慢慢地改变了……。
