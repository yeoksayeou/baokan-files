To all branch offices, offices, and correspondents:

    The Beginning of Spring has passed, and spring plowing is about to begin in various places. Please quickly seize the season to report on the agricultural production plans for this year and the spring plowing season in various places, as well as the spring production activities of the farmers. Such as spring plowing work: repairing land, purchasing livestock and farm tools, allocating seeds, increasing fertilizer accumulation, and organizing labor and livestock for spring plowing; flood prevention work: repairing rivers and dikes, planting trees and afforestation; new areas and spring famine areas: mass production for self-rescue, leadership in overcoming famine. Especially in areas where land reform and democratic party consolidation have ended, pay attention to reflecting the problems existing in farmers' production, the unity of all classes in production, and the organization of the masses (cooperation, mutual assistance) to become prosperous, as well as the leadership of rural branches and village cadres in mass production. In particular, in the old liberated areas where land reform has already ended, large-scale production campaigns will be launched this year. In addition to reporting on the general progress, various localities should pay more attention to new content and new characteristics, and conduct continuous reporting according to the season.
