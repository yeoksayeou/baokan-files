Jidong Dispatch:

　　The long-distance stretcher teams from various places here have gloriously returned to their hometowns after completing their missions. The five long-distance stretcher teams from Leting followed the army in battles on the Pingjin front. During the execution of their tasks, they displayed a high degree of revolutionary friendship, cherishing the wounded more than themselves. Acts such as receiving excrement and urine for the wounded and using their own money to buy food for the wounded were extremely common. One wounded soldier had constipation and couldn't defecate, so the civilian worker Zhou Kuan used his hand to remove the feces from the soldier's anus and used his own rice bowl to receive the urine. Xu Changshun took off his new cotton-padded coat and put it on the wounded soldier, eventually giving it to him. Some civilian workers tore their own clothes to wipe blood for the wounded. One wounded soldier wanted to eat persimmons, so the civilian worker Guo Yongjiu, fearing he would catch a cold, ran more than three miles to buy apples from another village. The civilian workers of the Third Regiment alone spent more than 3,100 yuan (People's Currency) of their own money to buy things for the wounded. Some civilian workers, in order to comfort the wounded, used their own money to buy cloth and make small red flags, on which were written words such as: "Welcome comrades who are gloriously wounded to our stretchers, we guarantee safe delivery to the hospital," and achieved "three steadies and one fast" (steady lifting, steady walking, steady placing, and fast walking) in transporting the wounded. On one occasion, fifty-six stretchers transported two hundred and thirty-five wounded soldiers, completing a round trip of more than thirty miles in five hours, enabling the wounded to receive timely treatment. In addition, the civilian workers actively participated in other transportation and support-the-front work during their spare time. For example, the civilian workers of the Second Regiment voluntarily helped load trucks at their station, persisting for two days and one night. The civilian workers also proposed launching a "three-no-go" movement (not leaving until the water tank is full, not leaving until the yard is swept clean, not leaving until the procedures are completed). During the long-distance expedition with the army, the civilian workers of the county produced a large number of heroes and models in supporting the front, winning four "Meritorious Service in the Tianjin Campaign" banners and one pennant from the front-line troops, and were awarded 234 Model Red Star Medals, 244 Meritorious Service Certificates, 45 Certificates of Honor, and 26 rifles of various lengths. The Wuqing County Stretcher Team, since its expedition with the army in mid-November of last year to the Ningnan front line, lasted two months, trekking more than 2,000 miles, overcoming all difficulties, and completing its mission. Once, during a rapid march in the mountains, they climbed over four large mountains in one day and night, with no one falling behind. The civilian worker Bai Fengqi's feet were so worn and frozen that they ulcerated and oozed pus. The superiors told him to go home to recuperate, but he said, "I will not go home until the Chiang bandits are eliminated!" and persisted until the mission was completed. Li Changying's shoes were worn out and his feet were cracked with frostbite, but he did not fall behind. The Party member Wang Zhilin vomited blood from climbing the mountain but encouraged others, saying, "What is this for young lads!" The entire team had seventeen people credited with major meritorious service and ninety-seven people credited with minor meritorious service, and was awarded a "Model of Supporting the Front" banner by the front-line troops.

　　随军转战数千里
  　冀东担架团凯旋
    【冀东电】此间各地远征担架团完成任务相继光荣返乡。乐亭五个远征担架团随军转战平津前线，在执行任务中发挥了高度的革命友爱精神，爱护伤员超过爱护自己，给伤员接屎接尿，用自己钱给伤员买东西吃等事迹极为普遍。一个伤员大便干燥拉不下来，民工周宽用手从肛门里给掏出来，并用自己的饭碗给伤员接尿。许昌顺脱下新棉衣给伤员穿上，最后还赠给伤员。有些民工扯破自己衣服给伤员擦血，有个伤员想吃柿子，民工郭永久怕他受凉，就跑三里多地由外村买来苹果，仅三团民工拿自己钱给伤员买东西吃就用去人民币三千一百多元。有的民工为了安慰伤员，用自己钱买布做成小红旗，上面写着：“欢迎光荣负伤的同志们到我们担架上来，保证安全送到医院”等字样，在转送伤员中作到了“三稳一快”（抬稳、走稳、放稳、走快）。有一次五十六付担架转运二百卅五个伤员，往返三十余里路程，五小时就完成了，使伤员及时得到治疗。此外，民工有了空闲时间就积极参加其他运输、支援前线工作，如二团民工在驻地自动帮助运输车装载，一直坚持了两昼一夜。民工们还提出了展开三不走运动（水缸挑不满不走，院子扫不净不走，不办清手续不走）。该县民工在随军远征中涌现出大批支援前线功臣与模范，荣获前线部队“天津战役有功”等奖旗四面、锦标一面，并分别援予模范红星奖章二百卅四枚，建功证二百四十四个，光荣奖状四十五张及长短枪廿六支。武清县担架团自去年十一月中旬随军出征至宁南前线，历时二月，跋涉二千余里，克服一切困难，完成了任务。有一次山地急行军，一昼夜爬过四个大山，没一人掉队。民工白凤岐连磨加冻以至脚气溃成疮，流浓水，上级叫他回家休养，他说：“不消灭蒋匪我是不回家的！”一直坚持到完成任务。李昌英的鞋磨破，脚冻裂了也不掉队。党员王志林爬山累的吐了血还鼓励别人说：“年青小伙子这算啥！”全团立大功者十七人，立小功者九十七人，荣获前线部队奖予“支前范例”光荣旗一面。
