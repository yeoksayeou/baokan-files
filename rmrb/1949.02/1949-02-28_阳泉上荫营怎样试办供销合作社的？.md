　　How Yangquan Shangyinying Trialed Supply and Marketing Cooperatives?
　　Bu Ke　Lü Guangming
　　Shangyinying is the general name for five villages, with a total of 1,043 households and 4,253 people. The whole village has 14 casting pot furnaces, 8 semi-mechanized wind and fire furnaces, 4 iron-smelting furnaces, and 1 plowshare furnace, making it the coal and iron industry center of the city. After the village was liberated, two cooperatives were established. The first was in 1945, when a large cooperative was established in the whole village, with 300 yuan per share, and the shares were later expanded to organize coal and iron production. In the summer of 1946, after the bandit Yan reoccupied Yinying, the foundation was completely lost. The second time was in 1947 (when the village was re-liberated), when the five villages each established a village cooperative by extracting a part of the fruits of the land reform struggle. Its characteristics were: the capital was all fruit, and all the peasants who had turned over were naturally members of the cooperative, and no one was responsible for losing money (Note: fruit is not allowed to run cooperatives); secondly, there was no difference between members and non-members buying things. The Hougou Village cooperative was purely a grocery store. The original capital of 60 shi of millet lost 26 shi, and more than 800,000 yuan of external debts could not be recovered, so it closed down. The masses were indifferent to these cooperatives. Therefore, when trying to run supply and marketing cooperatives here, the work team believed that it would be difficult to reverse the masses' thinking if the existing cooperatives were transformed. Moreover, it would be necessary to settle accounts, distribute fruits, and clear external debts, which would be difficult to solve in the short term. Therefore, it was decided to leave the old cooperatives, and the cadres of the work team would set up stalls themselves, engage in supply and marketing, publicize the articles of association, explain, develop members, and set an example for the masses. After gaining the trust of the masses, the village would take over.
　　At the beginning of the trial, a joint meeting of the branch committee and village cadres was first held to open up the thinking of the party members and village cadres, and they were asked to publicize and deliberate among the masses and play a leading role as the backbone; then, a joint meeting of the cadres of the original cooperatives in each village was held to explain the principled difference between this trial supply and marketing cooperative and the past "cooperative," and appropriately review the reasons why the past cooperatives had not been run well, and the responsibilities that the leading organs should bear, and told them to work with peace of mind. Whether the original cooperatives would be transformed or ended after the supply and marketing cooperatives were run well would be decided by the masses through discussion. In addition, a meeting of representatives of the furnace industry was held to explain the policy of the supply and marketing cooperatives, which was to help them sell finished products and provide raw materials and daily necessities for production at low prices, and to publicize the qualifications, rights, and obligations of individual members and group members. Later, they went deep into each alley, focusing on ironworkers and their families, to carry out mobilization and explanation. Because the masses had a bad impression of cooperatives, they were mostly distrustful of supply and marketing cooperatives. The masses in Hougou Village were even less interested in the trial supply and marketing cooperative because the past cooperative had lost money. At that time, only the wind and fire furnace workers in Pingshang Village were very happy to hear that grain was being rationed, because the price of grain would rise every time they received their wages. The work team paid special attention to the publicity work for the wind and fire furnace workers, and the party members and village cadres of the village also actively explained to the masses, and the masses' thinking began to change. The number of people who joined the shares gradually increased. Especially the masses in Pingshang Village were in the highest mood. Within seven days, individual members who joined the shares accounted for 50% of the village's population, and seven cooperative cadres were selected. From January 10th to 25th, 1,468 members from five villages joined the shares. Most of them were workers and their families, accounting for 34% of the total population of the village. 107 donkeys and 32 mules of the members also participated in the transportation of the supply and marketing cooperatives, and 12 worker cooperative furnaces joined the supply and marketing cooperatives as group members; but there were still a considerable number of people who were watching.
　　In terms of business: the supply and marketing cooperative first established supply and marketing businesses responsible for individual members in each village. Then, a central supply and marketing cooperative was set up to unify leadership, and its tasks were to supply group members and village supply and marketing cooperatives with necessary materials and raw materials, and to purchase their products. After discussion by the representatives of the group members, each cooperative furnace invested 2 shi of rice to the central supply and marketing cooperative. The individual members agreed that the share capital would be temporarily 6 jin of rice per share, and would be increased after the cooperative was run well. Regarding the issue of organization, there was a great debate: some people advocated taking the household as the basis, forming a group of five to eleven people, and issuing a member purchase certificate to each household; some members opposed this view, fearing that organizing based on the household would not be conducive to giving play to democracy and would easily form a patriarchal system, affecting the freedom of speech of their children. In the end, the majority believed that in order to facilitate the convening of group meetings and to save each family member from being rationed a share, and because the supply and marketing business was based on the common interests of their entire family, there would not be much difference of opinion, and it was decided that it would be better to organize based on the household than to organize in a disorganized manner. After these issues were resolved, the members discussed in groups the procedures and quantity for the first ration, and decided to ration once every half month. This time, because the Lunar New Year was approaching, each member was rationed 4 jin of white flour, 0.5 jin of oil, 2 jin of salt, 5 jin of corn, and 6 jin of millet. The discussion also decided that the ration should have a time limit, otherwise the price of the goods would fall and the members would not want them; if the price of the goods rose, the cooperative would lose money.
　　After the first ration, those who had not joined the cooperative truly saw the benefits of organizing a supply and marketing cooperative and actively requested to join the shares. As of January 25, a total of 12,603 jin of share rice had been received. The central supply and marketing cooperative and the five village supply and marketing cooperatives simultaneously started supply and marketing operations. Based on the situation of the trial supply and marketing cooperatives in the village, the following preliminary opinions are provided for reference and research in various places:
　　(1) This time, Yangquan City used key cadres to personally lead the work team, select key points, and conduct a relatively long period of trial. The standard for key points is the economic center. There are several advantages to this: that is, we still lack this kind of experience, the trial area is small, and it is easy to study experience and lessons, but it must be presided over by cadres with a considerable level of policy. At the same time, key demonstrations can also break the masses' concerns and begin to reverse the masses' views on cooperatives. Now, many villages near Yinying have cooperative iron furnace workers who have requested the work team to go to their villages to lead the establishment of this kind of supply and marketing cooperative.
　　(2) Great attention should be paid to publicity work. From this trial supply and marketing cooperative in Yinying, it can be seen that due to the masses' doubts about running a good cooperative, it is necessary to strengthen publicity and explanation work. It is necessary to advocate "Don't say what you can't do, do what you say." This time, the articles of association of the supply and marketing cooperative were initially drafted, and at the same time, an outline for publicity was made, and the members discussed and revised it. The masses attached great importance to this kind of articles of association, and they said: "With the articles of association, it will be easy to do things." In publicity, it is necessary to combine understanding the situation and start from the urgent needs of the masses, and attention should be paid to opening up the thinking of party members and cadres, paying attention to discovering activists, and publicizing and explaining to the masses through them and playing a leading role, and the masses will easily believe it.
　　(3) In the trial of cooperatives, the various systems, procedures, articles of association, etc. should be led and democratically approved through discussion by the members, so that the enthusiasm of the masses can be inspired, they will think that it is their own business, and they will consciously and easily implement and abide by them. The initial share capital should not be too large, too large it will be difficult to develop members (because it is based on people joining the shares), but in areas with basically the same economic conditions, the leadership initially formulates the share capital standard, and through discussion by the members, it is easy to balance and unify. After the supply and marketing cooperative is truly supported by the members, the share capital will continue to increase.
　　(4) When commodity prices fluctuate greatly, the time limit for pricing and rationing materials should not be too long. Before the Lunar New Year, the Yinying supply and marketing cooperative rationed materials for the first time. Because the municipal leading organs, state-owned stores, and the work team had no experience and did not estimate the price increase at the end of the year, they announced to the members that the price of rationed materials would remain unchanged for half a month, and because it was the first ration, the time limit was relatively long and they were allowed to take it all within half a month. At that time, it was supplied to the members at 4% lower than the market price. Due to the price increase, it was actually 100% lower than the market price within half a month, causing the state-owned stores to lose 300,000 yuan (RMB) due to the trial supply and marketing cooperative in the village. Therefore, the state-owned stores should often guarantee a certain low-price ratio for the necessities supplied to the supply and marketing cooperative, and the practice of stipulating that the price will remain unchanged for half a month is obviously inappropriate.

　　阳泉上荫营怎样试办供销合作社的？
    布克　吕光明
    上荫营是五个村的总称，共有一千零四十三户，四千二百五十三口人。全村有铸锅炉十四座，半机器式的风火炉八座，焖铁炉四座，犁铧炉一座，是该市的煤铁业中心。该村解放后，曾办过两次合作社，第一次在一九四五年，全村办了个大合作社，每股三百元，后又扩大了一次股，以组织煤铁业生产。一九四六年夏阎匪重占荫营后，把底子全丢光了。第二次在一九四七年（该村重获解放），五个村把土地改革的斗争果实抽出一部，各办了一个村合作社。其特点是：资本都是果实，全村翻身农民都是当然社员，赔了钱没人负责（按：果实是不允许办合作社的）；其次是社员、非社员买东西没有分别，其中后沟村社是纯粹的杂货铺，原有六十市石小米的资本，赔了二十六石，另有八十多万元的外欠要不回来，因之歇了业。群众对这些合作社的态度表示冷淡。因此，在此试办供销社，工作组认为如在原有合作社基础上改造，群众思想不易扭转，况且又得结算帐目，分配果实，清理外欠，短期内不易解决，故决定离开旧合作社，由工作组干部自行设摊，经营供销，公布章程，宣传解释，发展社员，给群众作个样子，取得群众信任后，再由村里接办。
    试办之初，首先召开了支委、村干部联席会，打通党员、村干部的思想，通过他们在群众中作宣传酝酿，并起骨干带头作用；继又召开各村原有合作社干部联席会，说明此次试办供销社与过去“合作社”的原则区别，并适当的检讨了过去合作社没办好的原因，和领导机关应负的责任，告他们安心工作，待以后供销社办好了，原有合作社是改造或结束，由群众讨论决定。此外又开了炉业代表会，讲解供销社的方针，是帮助他们推销成品，廉价供给生产原料与生活资料，公布个人社员、团体社员的资格、权益与义务等。后又深入各闾，以铁业工人与家属为主要对象，来进行动员解释。由于群众对合作社印象不佳，对于供销社也多抱着不信任的态度。后沟村的群众，因过去合作社赔了钱，对此次试办供销社是更不感兴趣。当时仅坪上村风火炉工人，听说配售粮食很高兴，因为他们每当领到工资后，粮食就上涨。工作组特别抓紧对风火炉工人的宣传工作，该村党员、村干部也积极在群众中作解释，群众思想开始转变，入股者逐渐增多，特别是坪上村群众情绪最高，七天内个人社员入股者占全村人口百分之五十，并且选出七个合作社干部。由一月十日至二十五日，五个村有一千四百六十八名社员入股，他们之中大多数是工人与工人家属，占全村总人口百分之三十四。社员的一百零七头驴，三十二头骡子也参加了供销社作运输，十二个工人合作炉以团体社员资格加入供销社；但仍有相当数量的群众观望。
    在业务方面：供销社先在各村成立负责个人社员的供销业务。再设一中心供销社，统一领导，任务为供给团体社员与村供销社必需物资与原料，收购其产品。经过团体社员代表讨论，每个合作炉向中心供销社入股米二市石，个人社员公议，股金暂以六市斤米为一股，待办好后再增加。关于编组问题，曾发生过很大争论：有的人主张以户为基础，由五人至十一人编一组，一户发一张社员购货证；有的社员反对这个意见，怕以户为基础编组不易发挥民主，容易形成家长包办，影响其子女自由发言。最后还是多数认为，为了便于召集小组会议，及省得全家每人配售一份，且因供销事业基于其全家人共同利益的基础上，不会有多大分歧意见，决定以户为基础编组，比打乱编组为好。这些问题解决以后，社员即分组讨论，首次配售手续与数量，决定半月配售一次，这次因要过旧历年，每个社员配售白面四斤、油半斤、盐二斤、玉茭五斤、小米六斤。讨论会上又决定配售应有限期，不然货跌了价，社员不要了；货涨了价，合作社赔钱。
    经过首次配售以后，未入社的人，真正看到了组织供销社的好处，积极要求入股，截止一月二十五日统计，共收到股米一万二千六百零三斤，中心供销社与五个村供销社，同时开始了供销业务。根据该村试办供销合作社的情况，提供以下几点初步意见，以便各地作参考研究：
    （一）这次阳泉市以主要干部亲自带领工作组，选择重点，进行较长时间的试办，重点的标准是经济中心，这样做有几点好处：即我们还缺乏这种经验，试办面小，易于研究经验教训，但须有相当政策水平的干部主持。同时，重点示范也可打破群众顾虑，开始扭转群众对合作社的看法，现在荫营附近已有不少村庄的合作铁炉工人，要求工作组到他们村去领导办这种供销合作社。
    （二）应十分注意宣传工作。从这次荫营试办供销社看来，由于群众怀疑对办好合作社，必须加强宣传解释工作。要提倡“作不到的不说，说到就作到。”这次初步草拟了供销社章程，一面作宣传提纲，一面和社员讨论修正，群众对于这种章程很重视，他们说：“有了章程就好办事啦。”宣传中要结合了解情况，从群众的迫切需要出发，并应注意打通党员与干部的思想，注意发现积极分子，通过他们向群众宣传解释并起带头作用，群众就会容易相信。
    （三）试办合作社中，所订各种制度、手续、章程等，应有领导的经过社员讨论民主通过，这样能够启发群众的积极性，认为是他们自己的事情，执行与遵守上也会自觉与容易。初定股金，不要太大，太大了不好发展社员（因系以人入股），但在经济条件大体相同的地区，领导上初步拟定股金标准，通过社员讨论，容易平衡一致，供销社为社员真正的拥护后，股金会不断增加。
    （四）在物价波动较大时，定价配售物资限期不宜过长。阴历年前，荫营供销社首次配售物资，因市内领导机关、国营商店与工作组，没有经验，没有估计到年关物价上涨，向社员宣布了配售物资半个月不变价，又因系第一次配售，限期较长，允许半月内取完，当时是以低于市价百分之四供给社员，由于物价上涨，半月内竟低于市价到百分之百，致使公营商店因在该村试办供销合作社而亏赔三十万元（人民币）。因之国营商店供应供销社的必需品，应经常保证一定的低价比例就够了，规定半个月不变价的作法，显然是不妥的。
