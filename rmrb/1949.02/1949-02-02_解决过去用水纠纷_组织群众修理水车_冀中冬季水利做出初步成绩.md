[Hebei Central Telegram] In order to lay the foundation for agricultural production, the Central Hebei Administrative Office has made some progress in water conservancy work in various places in the month and a half since the water conservancy conference was held last November. However, the promotion of the overall work is still far from sufficient.

(1) Achievements: After the Central Hebei Water Conservancy Conference, each special zone conveyed and deployed the winter water conservancy work, and the cadres of each water conservancy promotion association went to the countryside in groups to carry out construction work. During this period, in the fifty-one villages carried out by the second and third water conservancy promotion associations, two new well-digging teams and six mobile furnaces were organized, forty-eight wells were repaired, one hundred and twenty waterwheels were repaired, one new well was dug, and fifty-five waterwheels were purchased. Fifteen villages also organized a well-digging team, with the masses raising 43,006,800 yuan (border currency, the same below) and 5,190,000 yuan in floating wealth, and loans of 25,997,000 yuan; planning to dig ten wells and preparing to repair forty wells. In order to support the development of waterwheel work in various places and facilitate the purchase by the masses, each water conservancy promotion association has allocated funds to order waterwheels in various places. The Second Association ordered 130 units, the Third Association ordered 257 units, and the First Association mainly controlled waterwheel parts and also purchased 1,000 kilograms of five-fen iron bars.

(2) Working methods and experience: The working groups of each water conservancy promotion association have gained the following experiences in promoting water conservancy work: 1. Holding forums with old farmers is a good way to understand the specific situation in the village. For example, when the Boye working group went to Dongbo Village, they talked with the village cadres, who emphasized many difficulties and believed that water conservancy work could not be carried out. However, after learning from the forum of old farmers, it was found that repairing waterwheels was an urgent requirement of the masses. Later, two waterwheel repair teams were organized, which were supported by the masses. 2. Establish village water conservancy organizations. In villages with many waterwheels, a water conservancy section can be established under the leadership of the village production committee, and reputable and hardworking farmers can be absorbed to take charge of organizing and promoting water conservancy work in the village, which is convenient for the development of work. 3. Inspire the masses to repair waterwheels by means of accounting. For example, Hao Laojing and 22 other families in Xicheng Village, Shenze, shared a broken waterwheel. At first, they felt that the repair would cost a lot of money and they had to take out a loan. Later, after calculating for him, it would cost 400,000 yuan to repair it. Irrigating 32 mu of land would only cost 12,000 yuan per mu. In this way, it was quickly repaired. 4. Solving specific problems is the key to organizing the masses to repair waterwheels. Generally, the masses have the strength to jointly raise funds to repair waterwheels, but due to disputes or concerns between each other, they cannot repair them in time. For example, Yin Luocong and Liu Mingchi (female) in Xicheng Village, Shenze, shared a waterwheel. Because Liu Mingchi had no labor and occupied the well for a long time, they often had disagreements, and no one repaired the waterwheel when it was broken. Li Luoxi and others in Magu Village, Anguo, had disagreements over irrigation, and no one repaired the waterwheel either. Later, after the working group convened a meeting of well-sharing households and carried out unity education, their broken waterwheels were repaired. 5. Organize mobile furnaces to go to the countryside to repair waterwheels for the masses. Because the masses could not find workers or were too far away, they felt great difficulties. For example, the Shenze working group organized a mobile furnace to repair waterwheels in Xicheng Village. All 53 broken waterwheels in the village were repaired, and people from nearby villages came to repair them, which was welcomed by the masses.

(3) Current problems and future suggestions: 1. The leaders of counties and districts have not paid attention to the promotion of water conservancy work, and only a few water conservancy cadres are dancing alone. For example, the counties in the Ninth District did not combine this work when ending the land reform, and the development of water conservancy remained at the slogan level. In the future, the leadership should pay attention to it. 2. All localities have reported the difficulty of lacking bricks for digging wells, which is also an urgent problem to be solved. 3. The newly liberated peasants have high enthusiasm for production and have the desire to dig wells, but some of them do not have enough strength and need loan support. These problems must be solved in carrying out water conservancy construction work.

### 解决过去用水纠纷　组织群众修理水车  冀中冬季水利做出初步成绩

　　解决过去用水纠纷
  　组织群众修理水车
    冀中冬季水利做出初步成绩
    【冀中电】为了打下农业生产的基础，冀中行署自去年十一月份召开水利会议以后，一个半月当中，各地的水利工作都有一些开展，但在整个工作的推动上，还是十分不够的。
    （一）成绩方面：冀中水利会议以后，各专区把冬季的水利工作，都进行了传达布置，各水利推进社干部分组下乡进行建设工作。在这一段当中，第二、第三两个水利推进社所进行的五十一个村庄里，新组织起来了打井班两个，行炉六个，修理水井四十八眼，水车一百二十辆，打新井一眼，买水车五十五架。还有十五个村也组织了一个打井班，群众集资四万三千零六十万万八千元（边币下同），浮财五百一十九万元，贷款二千五百九十九万七千元；计划打井十个，准备修理水井四十眼。各水利推进社为了扶植各地水车工作的发展，便利群众购买，现已出款在各处订购水车，第二社订购了一百三十架，第三社订购了二百五十七架，第一社主要是掌握水车零件，也购买了五分铁棍一千斤。
    （二）工作方法和经验：各水利推进社工作组，在水利工作推动上，得出以下几点经验：一、召开老农座谈会，这是了解村中具体情况的好办法。如博野工作组到东伯庄工作时，和村干部去谈，他们强调提出好多困难，认为水利工作没法开展。可是从老农座谈会上一了解，发现修理水车是群众迫切的要求，后来组织了两个修理水车组，得到了群众的拥护。二、建立村水利组织。在水车多的村庄，可以在村生产委员会的领导下，建立水利股，吸收有威望劳动好的农民担任，专去组织推动本村水利工作，这样便利工作的开展。三、用算帐的方式启发群众修理水车。如深泽西城村郝老敬等二十二家伙着一架坏水车，起初觉着修理花钱很多，非贷款不行，后来给他计算了一下，有四十万元就修理好了。浇三十二亩地，每亩地才摊款一万二千元。这样很快就修理起来了。四、解决具体问题，这是组织群众修理水车的重要关键。一般群众合伙集资修理水车是有力量的，但因互相之间有纠纷或顾虑，不能及时修理。例如深泽西城村尹洛从和刘鸣池（女）伙着一架水车，因为刘鸣池没劳动力，占井时间长，常闹意见，水车坏了谁也不修理。安国马固村李洛喜他们伙着的水车因浇地闹意见，水车也是没人修理。后来经过工作组召开了伙井户会议，进行了团结教育，他们的坏水车都修起来了。五、组织行炉下乡给群众修理水车。因为群众找不到工人或离的太远，感到很大困难，如深泽工作组组织了一个行炉，到西城村修理水车，村里五十三辆坏水车全修理了，附近村庄人都找去修理，受到群众欢迎。
    （三）目前存在的问题和今后的意见：一、在水利工作的推动上，县区领导上没有重视起来，只是少数水利干部孤身跳舞。如九分区各县结束土改中，没有结合这一工作，把发展水利停留在口号上。今后领导上应当重视起来。二、各地反映打井缺砖的困难，这也是急待解决的问题。三、新翻身的农民，生产情绪很高，有打井的要求，但有的力量不足需要贷款扶持。这些问题都是在开展水利建设工作上必须解决的问题。
