　　Overcoming Bias in Issuing Land Certificates
　　Hong Yan
　　At present, the most urgent demand of the broad masses of people in rural areas is to establish land rights and develop production. Various regions in North China are also actively issuing land certificates. However, in some areas, the issuance of land certificates has encountered great resistance and difficulties, and there has been a bias towards simply issuing land certificates without paying attention to party consolidation or earnestly resolving the remaining issues of land reform, thereby losing the positive significance of issuing land certificates. This urgently needs to be corrected.
　　The first reason for this bias is the underestimation of the remaining problems of land reform. The Jizhong District once proposed "taking the issuance of land certificates as the central link," and other regions are also preparing to adopt similar practices. This is likely to simplify the entire concluding work of land reform, and even completely oppose the issuance of land certificates to resolving the remaining issues of land reform, and proposing "solving the remaining issues of land reform on the premise of issuing land certificates," all of which are wrong. The second reason is the lack of understanding or negligence of the purpose of issuing land certificates, which is to establish land rights, stabilize production, and the impatient thinking of being eager to complete the task. Under this kind of thinking, it manifests as a simple task-oriented view of issuing land certificates for the sake of issuing land certificates; it only requires completing the issuance of land certificates on schedule, only focusing on technical and procedural guidance and supervision, without vigorously publicizing our party's policies on ending land reform and developing production, without conducting mass ideological education and mobilization, and without earnestly and primarily doing all the concluding work of land reform. It is actually a kind of "putting the cart before the horse" approach.
　　The result of such an approach may encounter various difficulties, such as the negativity, dissatisfaction, and even resistance of party members and the masses (not filling out certificates, not taking old documents, or collectively concealing land, etc.). Therefore, not only will the work be prolonged, but also the purpose of unity and production cannot be fully achieved. Such villages cannot strongly reflect the enthusiastic emotions of the masses after confirming land rights, but rather a tense atmosphere of "checking black land" and "squeezing documents," making our work contrary to our wishes; even if land certificates are issued on schedule, some of them are difficult to be completely true. The experience of many regions is like this, and this lesson must be remembered.
　　In view of the above situation, my opinions on issuing land certificates are:
　　(1) The issuance of land certificates must be based on earnestly publicizing our party's policies on ending land reform, developing production and burdens, resolving the remaining issues of land reform, and conducting mass ideological mobilization. The entire process of issuing land certificates should first and foremost be to carry out the above work, and use this as a standard for checking the work. The technical and procedural issues of filling out certificates should not be forced to be completed within a limited time. It is an extremely unnecessary example that a certain county government carved two county government seals in order to cope with the "heavy" work of stamping certificate papers.
　　(2) In areas where the start is late and universal issuance is not possible before spring plowing, land certificates should first be issued to poor peasants who have newly obtained land, middle peasants who have moved land, and landlords and rich peasants. They are the most eager to issue land certificates. This is not only relatively simple and easy to do, but also, as long as these people issue land certificates, and the issuance is fair and reasonable, the purpose of unified production in the entire rural area can be basically achieved. As for middle peasants who have not moved land, a method of driving and influencing should be adopted, explaining the benefits of land certificates, and mobilizing them to "exchange old documents for new documents" and gradually issue them. Those who are temporarily unwilling to change should not be forced, and it should also be announced that their property rights are confirmed and the old documents are valid. It is unnecessary to eagerly declare all old documents invalid. However, it must be explained that if there are land disputes, the government will handle the problem according to the principle of old contracts and new contracts.

### 克服发土地证中的偏向

　　克服发土地证中的偏向
    洪研
    目前农村广大人民最迫切的要求是确定地权，发展生产。华北各区也都在积极的颁发土地证。但在目前某些地区发土地证中，有些地方却遇到了极大阻力和困难，并发生了不重视整党、不认真解决土地改革遗留问题而只单纯地去发土地证的偏向，以致失去发土地证的积极意义。这是急需纠正的。
    发生这种偏向的第一个原因，是由于把果地改革遗留问题估计过低。冀中区曾提出：“以发土地证为中心环节”，另有地区也准备采取类似的做法。这样极可能把全部土地改革的结束工作简单化，甚至把颁发土地证和解决土地改革遗留问题完全对立起来，而提出“在发完土地证的前提下解决土地改革遗留问题”，这些都是错误的。第二个原因，则是不了解或疏忽了发土地证的目的在于确定地权、安定生产，以及急于完成任务的急性病思想。在这种思想下，就表现了一种为发土地证而发土地证的单纯任务观点；就只要求按期完成发土地证，只偏重于技术的、手续问题的指导和督促，而没有大力宣传我党结束土地改革和发展生产的政策，不进行群众性的思想教育和思想发动，没有认真地、主要地做全部结束土地改革的工作。还实际上是一种“本末倒置”的做法。
    这样一种做法的结土，便可能遇到种种的困难，如党员、群众的消极、不满，乃至抵抗（不填证、不拿旧文书、或集体隐瞒土地等）。因而，不仅工作会拖长了时间，而且团结生产的目的也不能完全达到。这样的乡村，不能强烈反映群众于确定地权后的热烈情绪，反而是“查黑地”“挤文书”的紧张空气，使我们的工作，事与愿达；土地证即使按期发了，其中一部分也难于完全真实。不少地区经验如此，这一教训必须记取。
    针对以上情况，我对发土地证的意见是：
    （一）发土地证必须是在认真宣传我党结束土地改革、发展生产和负担的政策，解决土地改革遗留问题，进行群众思想发动的基础上去颁发。发土地证的全部过程，应该首先而且主要的是进行以上工作，并以此做为检查工作的标准。填证的技术和手续问题，则不必强求限期完成。某县政府为应付“繁重”的证纸盖印工作，而刻了两个县政府的印信，是极其不必要的实例。
    （二）在动手较迟，春耕前不可能普遍颁发的地区，应该首先发给新得土地的贫农、抽动土地的中农和地主、富农。他们要求发土地证最为迫切。这不仅做起来比较简单易行，而且，只要这些人发了土地证，并发的公平合理，整个农村团结生产的目的即可基本实现。至于未动土地的中农，应采取带动和影响的方式，说明土地证的好处，动员他们“旧文书换新文书”，逐步地发给。其暂时不愿换者可不必强求，并亦应宣布其产权确定，和旧文书有效。急于一律宣布旧文书作废，是不必要的。但须说明：如有土地纠纷，政府当依旧契尽新契的原则处理问题。
