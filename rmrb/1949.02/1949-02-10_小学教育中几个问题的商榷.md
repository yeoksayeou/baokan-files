Some Issues for Discussion in Primary Education
　　Di Ke Liu Yongbin

At the joint meeting of education section chiefs and normal school principals in the Beiyue Fourth Administrative Office in October last year, in order to restore and rectify primary education and exchange work experience, it was decided to organize three educational observation groups (a total of nine counties in this special zone, with every three counties forming a group), with three people in each group (normal school principals) responsible for inspecting three counties. Starting from December 10th, the groups focused on inspecting six or seven primary schools and completed the inspections by the end of the month.

Regarding primary education, based on the observations of the three observation groups, the following issues are raised:

　　(1) Grade Organization and Curriculum Progress

From this observation, it was seen that some primary schools still have not standardized student grade organization, with too many classes, which is inconvenient for teaching. For example, some junior primary schools have one classroom divided into Book 1 class, Book 2 class, Book 3 class, Book 4 class, Book 5 class... Each class has three or five or even one or two students. The reason for the inspection is that, on the one hand, the children of farmers go to school at different times and are delayed due to production leave; on the other hand, some students, after taking a few days of leave, are not individually helped by the teachers to make up for the lessons when they return to school, and they are allowed to form a class (grade) by themselves and drift down. Many of our current teachers are new, with little teaching experience and poor ability. To master four classes of multi-grade teaching, there is a phenomenon of attending to one thing and losing sight of another. If there are more classes, it will inevitably affect efficiency. Therefore, attention should be paid to merging and reorganizing. In addition, some complete primary schools have a senior class (such as the fifth grade of Jia Zhuang in Jingxing), with uneven levels, and multi-grade teaching must be implemented. Reorganization should also be carried out, either downgrading or upgrading the class, so that it becomes a single-grade class. In this way, the improvement of students' culture will be faster than in a multi-grade class.

The progress of the curriculum in each grade should also be carried out uniformly on schedule. For example, in the second grade of junior primary school in Xingtang County, the high ones teach 40 lessons of Book 4, and the low ones only teach 13 lessons of Book 3. Textbooks such as language and common sense are compiled according to the seasons and natural environment. It is inappropriate to talk about thunderstorms in winter and ice and snow in summer. The reason for checking the progress of the curriculum with such a large disparity is that, on the one hand, school cannot start on time, and students take too much leave; on the other hand, some teachers teach too fast, coarsely, and do not or do not follow the established procedures of teaching methods, only focusing on speed, regardless of the students' acceptance. There are also some teachers who are lazy and undisciplined, and cannot attend classes according to the timetable every day, and do not grasp the time tightly. The homework of this semester cannot be finished, so they have to drag it to the next semester to talk about it again. These two tendencies should be overcome urgently, and the progress of the curriculum must be grasped in a planned and accurate manner.

　　(2) School Buildings, Classrooms and Equipment

At present, most of the primary schools still occupy the old school buildings and classrooms from the Kuomintang era before the War of Resistance. At that time, due to the bourgeois education, most poor children could not go to school, and the number of students was very small. Now, after the land reform and equal distribution, the people's living conditions have been initially improved, and they demand a cultural emancipation. In addition, under our popular education policy, the number of school-age children in various villages has generally increased. As a result, the old school buildings and old classrooms appear narrow and crowded. For example, in Jiayu Village, Jianping, children who arrive early have seats, and those who arrive later are sent back. Therefore, many school buildings and classrooms need to be expanded. Even if the masses in some villages are still not very aware and there are not many children attending school, we should also see the long-term vision of the development of new democratic education. In the future, every child must be enrolled in school, and preparations should be made as soon as possible. In addition, we hope that at the end of this land reform, if the school buildings and classrooms in this village are too narrow, some temples or confiscated landlord's large houses, suitable for running schools, should be appropriately reserved for school use with the consent of the masses, and no longer be divided equally. Some old school buildings are narrow and need to be expanded. If there is open space or houses near the school building that have been confiscated from landlords, some can be appropriately given to the school. Even if they belong to middle and poor peasants, it is best to obtain their consent through persuasion and exchange them with the school for equal value, or allow the middle and poor peasants to divide some landlord's houses to live in, so as to develop school education.

In addition, in Pingshan, Jianping, and Jingxing counties, many small schools share a courtyard with the village office or ordinary people, which affects each other and is extremely inconvenient, and ways should be found to separate them.

As for teaching equipment, it is generally very simple. Many small schools' desks and benches are incomplete due to the destruction and loss by the enemy and puppets. Most primary schools in Jianping, Pingshan, and Lingshou counties support wooden boards of varying widths, heights, and unevenness, with six or seven people sitting in a row, which is very crowded and harmful to children's learning and physical development. For example, in the junior primary school of Nanqu Bridge Quyang First Complete Primary School in Xingtang, there are no support boards, and students have to stand when they go to school. Most schools only have a large blackboard, and there are no small blackboards or hanging pictures. The senior departments do not have any instruments or specimens, not to mention the necessary recreational equipment for children. We believe that attention should be paid to gradually adding or collecting these things to facilitate teaching.

　　(3) On the Issue of Teachers

First, during the inspection, it was seen that most teachers love to learn, work hard, and are very enthusiastic. However, there are also some teachers who want to go home to farm or propose to change careers, and their emotions are very unstable. The reasons are: first, the level of awareness is low, and the idea of serving the people arduously has not been clearly established; secondly, some places do not care enough about the lives of teachers, such as Baisha Village and Tongge Village in Huolu County, where teachers have not been paid salaries for several months, which is very wrong and should be paid as soon as possible.

Second, the cultural level and professional level of some teachers are too low. For example, a teacher in Nanzhuang, Jianping, taught students to pronounce "乌鸦" (wū yā, crow) as "鸟鸦" (niǎo yā), write "尊敬" (zūn jìng, respect) as "总敬" (zǒng jìng), "初" (chū, beginning) as "@", and "介母" (jiè mǔ, medial) as "界母" (jiè mǔ), causing a lot of jokes. A teacher in Hanjia Village Primary School in Quyang only read the language lesson once to the second grade and then explained it. The method was simple, the steps were rough, and children could not easily accept it. A teacher in Gaofukou Primary School did not prepare before class and did not pay attention to the distribution of teaching materials and time. One class lasted for two hours. The students were bored and the order was chaotic. After the third-grade homework was completed, it was not possible to assign it again in time or to conduct direct teaching. The students in that grade asked the teacher twice what he was doing? A teacher in Xiguan Primary School in Huolu explained new words in a non-popular way, such as the explanation of the word "堆" (duī, pile), writing on the blackboard "凡物之集多而高大者" (fán wù zhī jí duō ér gāo dà zhě, all things that are gathered are many and tall). A fifth-grade arithmetic teacher in Wangkuai Senior Primary School in Fuping, when correcting students' blackboard calculations, had a problem where the multiplicand was a denominate number and the multiplier was a non-denominate number. The student calculated it correctly, but he insisted that it was wrong and ordered the student to add a denominate number to the multiplier, forming a superfluous mistake.

Regarding the above problems, the educational leaders of each county and district should continuously use training classes, symposiums, and other methods to conduct ideological, professional, and cultural education for teachers. More importantly, establish a sound school district system, use student unions to conduct self-criticism and mutual criticism, and exchange business experiences. This will greatly improve the ability and work of teachers. In addition, for young teachers with too low cultural and working ability, they can be mobilized to continue studying at normal schools, and the vacancies can be filled by competent people. It is best for each county to appropriately check and handle this through annual leave training courses and teacher evaluation work.

　　(4) Children's Life Guidance

It is right to write red and green slogans and slogans in classrooms and schoolyards as a means of guiding children's life and learning; however, the wording must be appropriate, clear and popular, otherwise it will have a counterproductive effect. For example, the slogans in Xizhuang Primary School in Fuping are: "Work hard in production, take into account both public and private, and strive to be an excellent model" and "The characteristic of new democratic education is to not forget learning in production and to not neglect production in learning." These are all inconsistent with past educational policies and should be erased.

In addition, in managing children, there are still two deviations: one is that teachers dare not manage students and let them go, and the masses commented that our school has no rules at all, and students have no manners at all. Another deviation is to hand over children who have made mistakes to students for struggle. For example, Chenzhuang Complete Primary School and other schools in Lingshou have done this, and they still consider it a successful experience. This is a wrong understanding and practice. Even if it takes effect, it is only temporary, and it is easy to make this student afraid to go to school again, which is extremely inconsistent with educational principles. The senior department of Hanjia Village Complete Primary School in Quyang treated the three students who did not ask for leave by suspending their schooling, which was also inappropriate. Xingtang Nanzhuang Primary School hung a wooden sign with "No Face" on naughty children, and a "Naughty Seat" was specially set up in Shuncheng Street Primary School. This is not conducive to the cultivation of children's "self-esteem" and should be cancelled. Please knowledgeable people point out whether the above opinions are one-sided.

### 小学教育中几个问题的商榷

　　小学教育中几个问题的商榷
    迪克　刘永彬
    北岳四专署在去年十月召开的各县教育科长与师范校长联席会上，为了恢复、整顿小学教育与交流工作经验，决定组织教育观摩组三个（本专区共九个县，每三县结合为一组），每组三个人（系师范校长）负责三个县的检查，从十二月十日开始，有重点的检查六、七座小学，已于月底检查完毕。
    在小学教育方面，综合三个观摩组所见，提出以下几个问题：
　　（一）年级编制和课程进度
    从这次观摩中，看到还有部分小学，在学生年级的编制上，仍未走向正规，班次繁多，不便教学。如有的初小学校一个教室内，就分一册班（级）二册班、三册班、四册班、五册班……。每班三五个甚至一二个学生，检查原因，一方面是由于农家子弟上学时间迟早与因生产告假耽误而参差不齐；另方面也有的学生因告假数天，到校后，教员不个别帮助他补课，尽任其自形成为一班（级），自流下去。我们现在的教员同志，不少是新的，教学经验少，能力差，要掌握四个班的复式教学，就有顾此失彼的现象，如果班次再多，必然影响效率减低。因此应当注意归并和整编。另外，还有的完小一个高级班（如井陉贾庄五年级），程度不一，得实行复式教学，亦应进行整编，或退班或升级，使成为单式班，这样学生文化的提高，是会比复式班快的。
    在各年级课程的进度上，也应按期划一进行。如行唐县初小二年级的国语课，高的讲四册四十课，低的才讲三册十三课。象国语常识一类的课本，是依照季节自然环境编的，如果冬天讲雷雨，夏天讲冰雪是不妥当的。检查课程进度如此悬殊的原因，一方面是不能按时开学，和学生告假太多；另方面，也有的教员授课太快，粗率，不会或不去依照教学法的一定程序去进行，光图快，不管学生接受程度如何。还有的教员怠工，散漫，每天不能按照课程表上课，抓不紧，这学期的功课，讲不完，只得拖到下一学期再来讲。这两种偏向均亟应克服，一定要有计划的，准确的掌握课程进度。
　　（二）校舍教室和设备
    现在各小学占用的大部仍是抗战前国民党时代的旧校舍教室，那时候，由于是资产阶级的教育，大部分贫苦儿童不能上学，学生数很少；现在经过土地改革平分，群众生活初步改善，就要求文化上翻身。加上在我们大众化教育的方针下，各村入学儿童，普遍增加。因之，旧校舍、旧教室就显得狭小，拥挤不下，如建屏夹峪村，先去的儿童有坐位，后去的就被打发回来，所以校舍教室，很多需要扩充，即使有的村当时群众觉悟还差，上学儿童还不多，亦应看到新民主主义教育发展的远景，将来必须使每个儿童入学，早作准备。另外我们希望在此结束土地改革的时候，如本村校舍教室过份狭窄，有的寺院祠堂或没收地主的大房子，适合办学的房屋地址，通过群众同意适当的留做学校占用，不再平分。有些旧校舍狭小需要扩充的地方，如果靠近校舍有空地或房子，是没收地主的，也可以适当给学校一些，即使是中贫农的，亦最好经过说服动员取得同意，以同等价值换给学校一些，或让中贫农另分一些地主房子住，以便发展学校教育。
    另外，在平山、建屏、井陉三县，有不少小校与村公所或老百姓同居一院，互相影响，极不方便，亦应设法分住。
    作教具设备上，一般也很简陋。不少小校的桌凳，由于敌伪的破坏和遗失，都残缺不全了，建屏、平山、灵寿等县大部小学都是支着宽窄不一、高低不平的木板，一排坐六七人，很拥挤，对儿童的学习和生理发育上都有妨害。又如行唐南桥曲阳第一完小初级部，连支板也没有，学生上校就得立着。各校的教具，大都是一块大黑板，小黑板挂图等都没有，高级部也没有仪器标本，至于儿童必要的游艺器械，更是谈不到了。我们意见，在这些东西上，都应注意逐渐添置或搜集，以利教学。
　　（三）对教员问题
    第一、在检查中，看到大部分教员爱学习，下辛苦，工作热情很高。但也有一部分教员，愿回家种地或提出转行，情绪很不安定。其原因：一、是觉悟程度低，艰苦的为人民服务的思想尚未明确树立；其次，有些地方对教员生活的关心与照护不够，如获鹿白沙村、同阁村，好几个月不发给教员薪金米，是非常错误的，应赶快补发。
    第二、部分教员文化水平、业务水平太低，如建屏南庄教员，教学生把“乌鸦”念成“鸟鸦”，“尊敬”写成“总敬”，“初”写成“＠”，“介母”写成“界母”，弄出不少笑话。曲阳韩家村小校教员给二年级上国语课，只念了一遍就讲，方式简单，步骤粗率，儿童不容易接受。高阜口小校教员，课前不准备，没注意教材和时间的分配，一节课就上了两点钟，学生腻烦，秩序紊乱；三年级作业做完，不能及时再布置，或进行直接教学，该级学生两次催问教员干什么？获鹿西关小校教员解释生字不通俗，如“堆”字的解释，在黑板上写着“凡物之集多而高大者”。阜平王快高级五年级算术教员，在订正学生板算时，有一道题，被乘数是名数，乘数是不名数，学生算的就对，他硬说不对，命令学生在乘数上添了名数，形成画蛇添足之误。
    以上问题，各县区教育领导上，应不断运用训练班、座谈会等方式，对教员进行思想、业务、文化等教育。更重要的是建全学区制，运用学生会，作自我批评和互相批评，以及进行业务经验的交流，这样对教员能力和工作的提高，很起作用。另外对文化和工作能力太低的青年教员，可动员他继续上师范学校学习，遗缺让胜任者接充。这一点各县最好通过年假训练班与教员评等级工作，适当检查处理。
　　（四）儿童生活指导
    教室、校院多写红绿标语口号，作为对儿童生活学习指导的一种手段，是对的；但必须用词得当，明白通俗，否则会起反作用的。如阜平西庄小学内的标语写着：“努力生产、公私兼顾，争取优秀的模范”“新民主主义教育的特点，是生产不忘学习，学习不误生产”。这都是过去的不合乎教育政策的，应当刷去。
    另外在管理儿童方面，仍还存在两种偏向：一种是教员对学生，不敢管，放任自流，群众评论我们的学校，没有一点规矩，学生没有一点礼貌。另一种偏向，是把犯错的儿童，交给学生斗争，如灵寿陈庄完小等校，都这样搞过，他们还认为是一个成功的经验，这是错误的认误和作法，即便生效，也是暂时的，而且很容易使这个学生不敢再上学，这是极不合乎教育原则的。曲阳韩家村完小高级部，把不告假的三个学生停止学籍的处理办法，也不妥当，行唐南庄小学调皮儿童挂“没脸皮”木牌，顺成街小校内特设“调皮坐”，这样对儿童“自尊心”的培养，是不利的，应该取消。以上意见，是否带有片面性请识者指教。
