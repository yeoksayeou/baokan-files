Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, February 6th: TASS, Budapest: Rakosi, General Secretary of the Hungarian Working People's Party, delivered a speech at the founding congress of the Hungarian People's Independence Front on February 1st, elaborating on the goals of the People's Independence Front and the tasks it faces. Rakosi pointed out that the history of Hungary after the war proves that the path taken by the Communist Party to revitalize the country through its own efforts instead of American "aid" is correct; if it accepts American "aid," it must abandon independence and autonomy. The Hungarian Republic must become a People's Republic where the working people enjoy broader political rights. Rakosi pointed out the necessity of formulating a new constitution and further strengthening the worker-peasant alliance. Rakosi emphasized that the People's Independence Front faces a major task in building agriculture, especially in promoting the movement of production cooperatives. Regarding foreign policy, Rakosi emphasized that the People's Independence Front—a firm opponent of all imperialist attempts—will stand unyieldingly in the ranks of the powerful peace camp led by the Soviet Union. Rakosi further pointed out that the People's Independence Front is being established on a broader basis than the past National Independence Front, and the People's Independence Front will unite all progressive and democratic forces in the country. This gives it the right to become the leading body of the country. Rakosi emphasized that the People's Independence Front should be led by the working class, and the working class has shown through their sacrifice, knowledge, discipline, and vigilance that they are prepared to take on this leading role. Rakosi declared that the interim committee of the Front elected by the founding congress will convene a congress, and this congress will elect a permanent national committee.

　　Dobi, Chairman of the Independent Smallholders' Party and the current Prime Minister, and Ird, General Secretary of the National Peasant Party, declared on behalf of their respective parties that the interests of the working peasants are consistent with the interests of the People's Democratic State, and that the program of the People's Independence Front stipulates everything necessary to improve the living standards of the working peasants. Both of them, on behalf of their respective parties, guaranteed to wholeheartedly serve the goals of the Front. Apro, General Secretary of the Hungarian Trade Union Council, and Raz, General Secretary of the Hungarian National Union of Laboring Peasants and Agricultural Laborers, also declared on behalf of their respective organizations that the Hungarian working class and the national laboring peasants will work hard to achieve the goals of the People's Independence Front.

    独立小农党主席、现任内阁总理道比和国家农民党总书记伊尔德，分别代表他们的各该党宣称：劳动农民的利益，是与人民民主国家的利益一致的，而且，人民独立阵线的纲领，规定了提高劳动农民生活水准所必需的一切。他们两人代表他们各自的党，保证全心全意地为该阵线的目标服务。匈牙利职工会理事会总书记阿普罗及匈牙利全国劳动农民与农业劳动者联盟总书记拉兹，也代表各该组织宣称：匈牙利工人阶级及全国劳动农民，将竭力工作以实现人民独立阵线的目标。
