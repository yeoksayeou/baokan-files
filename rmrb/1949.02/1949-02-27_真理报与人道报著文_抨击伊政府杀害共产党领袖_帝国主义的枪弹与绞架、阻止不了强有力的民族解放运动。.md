Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, February 25th: Both the Soviet newspaper *Pravda* and the French newspaper *L'Humanité* published articles condemning the Iraqi reactionary authorities' brutal killing of four Communist leaders. *Pravda* published an article by Isakov stating: Saad and his behind-the-scenes backers are attempting to brutally eliminate the Communist Party and all progressive people in the country, thereby stifling the Iraqi people's movement. However, imperialist bullets and gallows cannot stop the powerful national liberation movement of all oppressed nations striving for freedom and independence.

*L'Humanité*, in an editorial titled "Blood and Oil," stated: The murderers of Iraqi Communist Party General Secretary Fahd and his comrades are Bevin and Truman, the oil tycoon Rockefeller Group, the Iraqi Petroleum Company, Standard Oil of New Jersey, and Standard Oil of New York, the American tycoons who are preparing for war. In order to wage war, they need oil and bases near the Soviet border. In order to prepare for war, they must—if they can—strangle the democrats who are leading the people to fight for peace. *L'Humanité* stated: Iraqi government head Saad has done his best for Rockefeller, Bevin, and the King of England. He will receive all the titles of "Founding Father of the Atlantic Pact." *L'Humanité* concluded: But from the hearts of honest people, in the hearts of workers all over the world, a lament will be sung for the martyrs. All those who fight for humanity tomorrow will express gratitude to these heroes who fought for peace. The crimes of imperialism are a sign of their weakness.

  　抨击伊政府杀害共产党领袖
    帝国主义的枪弹与绞架、阻止不了强有力的民族解放运动。
    【新华社陕北二十五日电】苏联真理报与法国人道报均著论抨击伊拉克反动当局的残杀四位共产党领袖。真理报发表伊萨科夫的论文称：萨德及其幕后牵线人企图凶暴地消灭共产党及其国内一切进步人民，这样来扼杀伊拉克人民运动，但是帝国主义的枪弹与绞架，都阻止不了各被压迫国家争取自由与独立之强有力的民族解放运动。
    人道报在题为“鲜血与石油”的社论中称：杀害伊拉克共产党总书记费赫德及其同伴的凶手是贝文和杜鲁门，是石油大王洛克菲勒集团、伊拉克石油公司、新泽西州美孚石油公司和纽约美孚石油公司，是正在准备战争的美国豪富。为了制造战争，他们需要石油和靠近苏联边界的基地。为了准备战争，他们必须——假如他们能够的话，绞杀领导着人民争取和平的民主分子。人道报纸称：伊政府首脑萨德已为洛克菲勒、贝文和英王尽了他的力量。他将获得“大西洋公约奠基者”的一切头衔。人道报最后写道：但是，从诚实的人们的心里，在全世界工人的心里，将唱起追悼被难者的挽歌。一切为了明天的人类而斗争的人们，将对这些争取和平的英雄们，表示感激。帝国主义的罪行是他们软弱的标帜。
