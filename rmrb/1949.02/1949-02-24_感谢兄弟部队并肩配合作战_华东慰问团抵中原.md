Next, Speaker Wang Yiting, who is seventy years old, spoke, saying: The rapid and victorious conclusion of the Huaihai Campaign gave the people in the rear a great encouragement. Now the broad masses of the people in the rear are stepping up production to support the front. Finally, Li Da, Chief of Staff of the Central Plains Field Army, delivered a reply, saying: "Our Central Plains Field Army will step up training and do all preparatory work to respond to the requirements and encouragement of the Party, government, military, and people's organizations in the rear of East China."
