　　Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 8th: Paris dispatch: Liu Ningyi, Vice Chairman of the All-China Federation of Trade Unions, told the press here on February 3rd that the All-China Federation of Trade Unions is planning to convene the Asian Workers' Congress as soon as possible in accordance with the resolution of the Executive Committee of the World Federation of Trade Unions. This congress will include representatives from all trade union organizations in India, Indonesia, Siam, Vietnam, the Philippines, Japan, and China. The main purpose of the meeting is to propose general guidelines for linking with the World Federation of Trade Unions and uniting the working people of Asian countries. Liu Ningyi also stated that the World Federation of Trade Unions is extremely concerned about the situation of Chinese trade unions, and the World Federation of Trade Unions has entrusted him to propose a plan for joint action between the All-China Federation of Trade Unions and the trade union organizations affiliated with the World Federation of Trade Unions at the next meeting. It is noted that the decision on convening the Asian Workers' Congress, which was adopted by the World Federation of Trade Unions in 1945, has not been implemented due to the consistent opposition of British and American representatives and their follower, the Dutch right-wing leader Kupers. The Executive Committee meeting of the World Federation of Trade Unions passed a resolution to have the Executive Bureau of the World Federation of Trade Unions send a delegation to Peiping in May to hold preparatory meetings with delegations from trade unions in many Asian countries in order to make all necessary preparations for convening the Asian Workers' Congress in the autumn. The Executive Committee of the World Federation of Trade Unions believes that the trade unions in some Asian countries are currently being persecuted by local reactionary governments or British colonial authorities, and the workers' movement has been driven underground. In this situation, it is necessary to take various precautionary measures for the delegations of trade unions in these countries. The Executive Committee decided that the World Federation of Trade Unions will establish a permanent liaison office to coordinate with the work of trade unions in Asian countries.

    全总副主席刘宁一发表谈话
    【新华社陕北八日电】巴黎消息：中华全国总工会副主席刘宁一于二月三日在此间告报界称：中华全国总工会正按照世界职工联盟执委会的决议，计划早日召开亚洲职工会代表大会，这一代表大会将包括印度、印尼、暹罗、越南、菲律宾、日本及中国的一切职工会组织的代表。会议的主要目的，是要提出与世界工联联系及团结亚洲各国劳动人民的总方针。刘宁一又称：世界工联极为关心中国职工会的状况，世界工联已委托他在下届会议上提出中华全国总工会与世界工联所属职工会组织共同行动的计划。按：世界工联于一九四五年所通过的关于召开亚洲职工会代表大会的决定，由于英美代表及其追随者荷兰右派库伯斯的一贯反对，迄未付诸实行。此次世界工联执委会会议通过决定，由世界工联执行局派遣代表团于五月间到北平，与亚洲许多国家职工会的代表团举行筹备会议，以便为在秋天召开亚洲职工代表大会进行一切必要准备。世界工联执委会认为：目前亚洲某些国家的职工会，受到当地反动政府或英国殖民地当局的迫害，工人运动已被赶入地下，在这种情况下，有必要为这些国家的职工会代表团作种种预防意外的措施。执委会决定，世界工联将设立永久性的联络机关，和亚洲各国职工会的工作配合。
