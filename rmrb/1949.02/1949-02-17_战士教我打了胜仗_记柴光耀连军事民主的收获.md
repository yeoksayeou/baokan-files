　　"The Soldiers Taught Me How to Win Battles"
    ——A Record of Chai Guangyao Company's Gains from Military Democracy
    Tang Jun
    On New Year's Day morning, I visited Chai Guangyao, the company commander of the 9th Company, a special-class meritorious unit of the 14th Detachment, with excitement and admiration. When I entered his company, I happened to see the clerk compiling statistics on the 1948 battle achievements. I casually asked, "Was there a great victory last year?" He smiled and handed me the statistical table, and I couldn't help but read aloud:
    Statistical Table of the Zhanglan, Xiaochang, and Naoma Battles: 987 prisoners (not counting those killed or wounded), 2.5 mountain guns, 31 light machine guns, 7 heavy machine guns, 39 submachine guns, 407 rifles and carbines, 3 mortars, 2 steel cannons, 3 “Yumen” cannons, 53 50mm mortars, 144,770 rounds of ammunition, 3 radios, 15 binoculars, 73 mules and horses... It is not uncommon for a company to capture so much in half a year in our army, but the source of the achievement is worth learning from:
    Before attacking the No. 1 bunker in the eastern suburbs of Linfen, everyone looked at the terrain and understood the enemy's situation; everyone used their brains to study the tactics; and selected the assault team. Wu Xinghan, Liu Jinbao, Zheng Yulong, and Dong Fulai requested to be on the assault team. Everyone approved Wu Xinghan because he was well prepared and met the conditions, and criticized Dong Fulai for being slippery in battle. Not only that, but for each person, each squad, and each task, there were encouragements, criticisms, analyses, and debates. As a result, the 2nd Platoon (led by platoon leader Chai Guangyao) was selected as the assault team. On the afternoon of April 21st last year, the attack was launched. After only 20 minutes of fierce fighting, the entire enemy's "Rescue 5th Company" was wiped out, and we only suffered four minor injuries. After that, the enemy's continuous and frantic counterattacks were all defeated by the warriors of the 9th Company.
    In the Xiaochang battle to encircle and annihilate Zhao Chengshou's group, the 9th Company was one of the main attacking units. After the troops quickly broke through the front line, the veteran soldiers rushed forward at full speed, leaving the 20 newly liberated soldiers behind. Deputy Company Commander Chai took them to the houses to observe. At that time, three people from the 6th Squad captured more than 40 enemies. He asked, "Did you see that?" They replied, "Yes." He asked again, "Is the fighting good?" They replied, "Good! Good!" They all automatically jumped down from the houses and fought alongside the veteran soldiers in the most intense areas of gunfire. After the battle, the entire company captured 595 enemies. Jia Gen, one of the newly liberated soldiers, captured more than 130 prisoners alone, and three Japanese became his spoils of war.
    The terrain of Naoma No. 6 bunker was prominent and dangerous, with an outer moat, two rows of barbed wire, and surrounded by giant landmines. The besieged Yan bandits had more than 150 people. After the 9th Company received the task of taking it down, they were all nervously and happily busy – looking at the terrain, thinking of solutions, checking preparations, and evaluating tasks. Before the battle, we had many debates: Is there an outer edge? Bring more explosives or less? Bring ladders or not? Assault from the concave path or the open ground? The results were all unified from divergence.
    At dusk on November 2nd last year, Xue Peizhen said while blasting a small bunker on the way forward: "I want to see the terrain before blasting." Chai Guangyao replied, "Go quickly and come back quickly." The troops charged in the explosion and smoke. In addition to the grenade and light machine gun groups, seeing that the enemy had many and strong firepower, they threw and shot at them. At the same time, our heavy artillery shells landed in the enemy's crowd. After Wang Dengdi blasted the front line, Xue Xiao Si rushed to the front. He saw that the enemy was very panicked, and a few were still trying to resist. He suggested: "Don't blast the barbed wire, quickly develop towards both flanks." The brave and alert Chai Guangyao quickly thought of the "one point, two sides" tactic, and ordered the troops to quickly outflank both flanks, annihilating the enemy. Indeed, the battle was completed according to his plan – we sacrificed one person, suffered four minor injuries, captured 42 enemies, and the rest were either killed or wounded. We completely occupied the No. 6 bunker.
    Chai Guangyao, 22 years old, had spent 18 years of his life as a beast of burden. In his childhood, his father was killed by a landlord, and his mother was forced to remarry, leaving him and his younger brother and sister to sell firewood and beg for food. He was drafted into the "army" by the war criminal Chiang Kai-shek and also served as a "soldier" for the Japanese. The index finger of his right hand was crippled by bandits. It is extremely painful to mention his history. In the summer of 1945, he carried a Japanese rifle and joined the People's Liberation Army. In less than four years, he became a special-class meritorious person of the people and a model commander (company commander) with both wisdom and courage! This is truly a leap forward!
    The masses are Zhuge Liang, with many ideas and the ability to complete any difficult combat missions. This is very clear in his mind. When training soldiers, fighting battles, or when work comes, he asks for advice with the attitude of a primary school student. At the beginning of training, their results were not great. After inspection, it was found that the leadership was not humble. From then on, Chai Guangyao asked Xue Xiaosi (a soldier) who threw the grenade the farthest to explain the essentials of throwing grenades every day. After a few weeks, the entire company improved from 22 meters to 34-35 meters. The same method was used to lead and inspire everyone to practice hard in blasting. In the end, only the purchasing sergeant and a sick person failed the test. Recently, seeing the arrival of the new situation, he is particularly eager to learn culture, and wants the soldier Zhao Wancai to teach him to write "rifle," "grenade"... In the year he has been company commander, he has always won victories with very small casualties. It can be said that military democracy is the first achievement in the 9th Company becoming a model company.
    Chai Guangyao has too many characteristics, but unfortunately, I cannot introduce them all one by one. When I expressed my respect to him for making great contributions to the people, he humbly said, "I have a short revolutionary history, joined the Party late, and understand few problems! I was born a poor man, and I hope to eliminate the enemy as soon as possible so that the poor can stand up early. The victory and progress of the 9th Company were given by the Party and the higher authorities, and it was the soldiers who taught me how to win battles."

### “战士教我打了胜仗”——记柴光耀连军事民主的收获

　　“战士教我打了胜仗”
    ——记柴光耀连军事民主的收获
    汤骏    
    元旦那天上午，我怀着兴奋和敬慕的心情，走访十四支队特等功臣九连柴光耀连长，在我走进他的连队时，正碰着文书在统计一九四八年战绩，我随便问了一句：“去年胜利很大吧？”他笑着把统计表递给我，我乐得禁不住高声读着：
    张兰、小常、淖马战斗战绩统计表：俘虏九百八十七名（打死打伤不算）、山炮两门半、轻机枪三十一挺、重机枪七挺、冲锋枪三十九枝、长短枪四百零七枝，迫击炮三门、钢炮两门、榆门炮三门、五○炮五十三门，子弹十四万四千七百七十发，电台三部，望远镜十五付，骡马七十三头……一个连队大半年缴获这样大，在我们部队里已经不是什么稀罕事了，但成绩来源是值得学习的：
    在攻击临汾东城下一号碉战斗前，他们人人看地形、了解敌情；个个用脑子，研究打法；评选突击队。吴兴汉、刘金保、郑玉龙、董福来要求突击，大家通过了吴兴汉，因为他准备充分，条件合适，批评董福来打仗爱耍滑头。不只这，对每个人、每个班、每个任务，都有鼓励、有批评、有分析、有争论的评选着。结果被评二排（排长柴光耀）为突击队。去年四月二十一日下午发起攻击，只经过二十分钟激烈的战斗，就歼灭敌补救五连全部，我们只轻伤四人。这以后，敌人连续的疯狂的反扑，都被九连的勇士们打垮了。
    在围歼赵承绶集团的小常战斗中，九连是主攻部队之一。部队迅速突破前沿后，老战士都飞速的向前冲锋着，把刚补充来的二十个新解放战士扔到后面，柴副连长把他们带到房子上看，当时有六班三个人就俘敌四十多名，他就问：“你看到没有？”回答：“看到了。”又问：“打的好不好？”又回答：“好！好。”他们都自动的从房子上跳下来，同老战士一块打向炮火最激烈的地方。战斗结束后，全连俘敌五百九十五名，光新解放战士贾根有一个人就捉了一百三十多个俘虏，有三个日本人也成了他的胜利品。
    淖马六号碉的地形突出、险要，一道外壕，两道铁丝网，周围布满了巨型地雷，困守的阎匪有一百五十多人。九连接领打下它的任务后，都紧张和愉快的忙碌着——看地形、想办法、查准备、评任务。战斗前，我们发生很多争论：有没有外沿？多带炸药还是少带炸药？带不带梯子？从凹道突击还是开阔地突击？结果都由分歧得到统一了。
    去年十一月二号黄昏，薛培珍在爆破前进途中的小碉时说：“我要看看地形再炸。”柴光耀回答：“快去快来。”部队就在爆炸声和烟雾中冲锋，除投弹组的手榴弹、轻机枪，看到敌人多火力强，他们就向那投掷和射击，在同一时间我们的重炮弹都降落在敌人的人堆中。王登第爆破了前沿后，薛小四冲锋在最前面，他看到敌人非常恐慌，少数的还企图抵抗，他提议：“不炸铁丝网，迅速向两冀发展。”勇猛和机警的柴光耀，很快想到一点两面的战术，就命令部队迅速的向两冀迂回，全歼敌人。的确，战斗就按照他的计划完成了——我们牺牲一人、轻伤四人，俘敌四十二名，其余的都打死打伤了，全部占领六号碉。
    二十二岁的柴光耀，就过了十八年牛马生活，儿童时候，父亲被地主害死，母亲被逼的改了嫁，留下自己和弟弟、妹妹卖柴、讨饭。被战犯蒋介石抓去当过“兵”、也当过日本人的“兵”，右手的食指被强盗们打残废了。提起他的历史来就痛苦极了。一九四五年夏天，他扛着日本人的步枪，投靠了人民解放军。不到四年的时间，他成为人民特等功臣，成为智勇双全的模范指挥员（连长）这真是一个飞跃的进步啊！
    群众是诸葛亮，办法多，能完成任何艰巨的战斗任务，这在他的思想上非常明确，练兵、战斗，工作来了，他以小学生的态度来请教。刚开始练兵，他们的成绩不大，经检查后知道是领导上不虚心，从此以后，柴光耀请投弹最远的薛小四（战士）每天讲投弹要领，几个星期以后，全连由二十二米进到三十四、五米了。在爆破上，也是用同样的办法来领导与启发大家苦练。最后测验只有采买上士和一个病号不会。最近，他看到新形势到来，学习文化的劲特别大，要战士赵万才教他写：“步枪”“手榴弹”……他连一年来，老是胜利大伤亡很小，九连能成为模范连队，可以说军事民主是第一功。
    柴光耀的特色太多了，可惜不能一一介绍它。在我向他为人民立了大功，而表示敬意时，他很谦虚的说：“我革命短，入党迟，了解问题少！我出身是个穷人，我希望快些消灭敌人，让穷人早日翻身。九连的胜利和进步，是党与上级给的，是战士教我打了胜仗”。
