Xinhua News Agency, Beiping, February 24th: The Pingjin Railway Administration was formally established in Beiping on the 22nd. Director Guo Hongtao, First Deputy Director Liu Jianzhang, and Second Deputy Director Guo Weicheng have arrived at the bureau to work. The headquarters of the bureau is located in Beiping, with branch bureaus established in Tianjin and Zhangjiakou. The bureau's jurisdiction includes the entire Ping-Sui Railway, the section of the Bei-Ning Railway within Shanhaiguan (including Shanhaiguan), the section of the Ping-Han Railway north of Shijiazhuang (excluding Shijiazhuang), the section of the Jin-Pu Railway north of Dezhou (including Dezhou), the entire Ping-Gu Railway, and all branch lines attached to the above lines. With the establishment of the bureau, the former Ping-Sui Railway Administration, Tianjin Railway Office, and railway takeover groups in Changxindian, Fengtai, Tongzhou, and other places, which were previously under the jurisdiction of various liberated areas, as well as the Pingjin District Railway Administration and the Northern Section Management Office of the Ping-Han District under the Kuomintang era, have all been abolished.

Tianjin Dispatch: The Hangu Chemical Plant, affiliated with the Tianjin Chemical Company, has officially started operations on February 6th after being taken over by the Tianjin Military Control Commission. The plant's main products include hydrochloric acid, caustic soda, bleaching powder, mirabilite, etc. During the Kuomintang rule, due to extreme economic difficulties, fuel, transportation, and sales became problematic. In addition, the electrolytic cells were severely damaged, and the transformer was burned out, leading to a shutdown two months before liberation. After the liberation of Tanggu and Hangu, more than 500 employees of the plant, under the call of the Tanggu Military Control Branch to resume work and production, automatically organized to repair machinery and prepare for resumption of work. Employees of the Third Plant's transformer substation, in cooperation with engineers from the Jibei Electric Power Company, completed the repair of the transformer at a faster pace than originally planned. They completed two weeks' worth of work in one week. When the 57 electrolytic cells of the electrolysis department were repaired and energized, the director of the Second Plant led the electrolysis department workers, wearing gas masks, to block leaks wherever they occurred. The morale of the employees was extremely high. Shao Quanbin, a worker in the gas department, said, "We didn't add acid at night when the Japanese were here, nor did we add it under the Kuomintang, but today we are liberated, so we add acid." (Adding sulfuric acid to the Nash pump). After the plant started operations on February 6th, production has gradually increased. The hydrochloric acid department produced 36 jars of hydrochloric acid (25 liters per jar) on the first day, increased to 68 jars on the second day, and continued to increase to 73 jars on the third day, exceeding the highest record during the Kuomintang rule (the highest daily output in the past was 72 jars, and the lowest was 5 jars). In addition, the caustic soda department produced 2.5 tons of solid caustic soda and 1.5 to 1.8 tons of bleaching powder. The First Plant produced 10.7 tons of crystalline mirabilite and 9.7 tons of anhydrous mirabilite per day.

　　平津铁路管理局成立
  　天津汉沽化学工厂恢复生产
    【新华社北平二十四日电】平津铁路管理局于二十二日在平正式成立。局长郭洪涛，第一副局长刘建章，第二副局长郭维城已到局办公。该局总局设在北平，另在天津及张家口两地设立分局。该局计辖平绥路全线，北宁路关内段（包括山海关），平汉路石家庄以北段（不包括石家庄），津浦路德州以北段（包括德州），平古路全线及以上各路的附支线。该局成立后，前分属各解放区的平绥铁路管理局、天津铁道处及长辛店、丰台、通州等地的铁道接管组，以及国民党时代的平津区铁路管理局、平汉区铁路北段管理处等机构均告撤销。
    【天津电】天津化学公司所属汉沽化学工厂，经天津军管会接管后，已于二月六日正式开工。该厂主要产品有盐酸、烧碱、漂粉、芒硝等。在国民党统治时期，因经济极度困难，燃料、运输、销路均成问题，加之电解槽已残破不堪，变压器又行烧毁，在解放前两个月便停了工。塘大及汉沽解放后，该厂五百余职工，在塘大军管分会复工复业的号召下，便自动组织起来，修理机器，准备复工。第三厂变压所职工协同冀北电力公司的工程师以超过原来计划的速度突击完成变压器的修理工作，有一次两周的工作，他们一周便完成了。当电解部五十七个电解槽修好通电以后，二厂主任即率领电解部职工，带上防毒面具，在哪里漏气哪里堵。职工情绪异常高涨，瓦斯部工人邵权彬说：“鬼子在时我们晚上不加酸，国民党时也不加，今天解放了我们才加酸。”（加硫酸在纳氏泵里）。二月六日该厂开工后，产量已逐步提高，盐酸部头一天产盐酸三十六坛（每坛二十五立升），第二天增为六十八坛，第三天继增至七十三坛，已超过国民党统治时期的最高纪录（过去每日产量最高七十二坛，最低五坛）。另外烧碱部产固体烧碱二点五吨，漂白粉一点五至一点八吨，一厂日产结晶芒硝一零点七吨，无水芒硝九点七吨。
