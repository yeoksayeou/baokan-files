　　Xinhua News Agency, Beiping, 21st — The news of the Kuomintang bandit gang's shooting of Shanghai transportation workers Gu Bokang, Zhong Quanzhou, and Wang Yuan has aroused great indignation among the people of Beiping. Workers and students believe that this Shanghai tragedy further proves that the Kuomintang reactionaries' peace conspiracy is a deceptive smokescreen to buy time and prepare for war. In order to achieve genuine peace and avenge the dead workers, war criminals must be resolutely punished. When railway workers in Changxindian heard the news that their brothers had been brutally murdered by the enemy, they were extremely agitated. Yang Baosong, an old worker who participated in the "February 7th" struggle, said passionately: "Those who killed the workers must be brought to justice! Let's see where these two executioners, Tang Enbo and Chen Daqing, can run to!" After learning about this news, the workers of the Shijingshan Iron and Steel Plant immediately held a meeting. The meeting unanimously agreed that in order for workers to achieve complete liberation, they must resolutely support the People's Government, defeat the reactionaries, and avenge the heroic martyrs. The preparatory committee of the plant's trade union has issued a statement calling on the liberated workers of Beiping to fight for the support of their worker brothers under the reactionary rule of the Kuomintang. The Pingjin Railway Bureau Staff Friendship Association, the Women's Federation, and the Xizhimen Railway Employee Mutual Aid Association have also sent telegrams calling on workers across the country to unite, step up production, support the People's Liberation Army, liberate Shanghai, and capture the murderers Tang Enbo and Chen Daqing alive. The preparatory committee of the Beiping Tramway Workers wrote a letter of solidarity to the striking workers in Shanghai and suggested to all workers in Beiping to jointly hold a memorial service to vow to avenge the dead. The employees of Jibei Electric Power Company advocated that "blood debts must be repaid with blood." Sanlunche driver Ren Li said: "Tang Enbo's and Xu Huidong's fates are the same, and they will be judged by the people sooner or later." Students in Beiping also expressed their protests. The Student Union of Normal University issued a statement saying: "We have tasted what it is like to be persecuted by the Kuomintang reactionaries. Today, in liberation, we feel even more the preciousness and lovableness of democracy and freedom. The workers, peasants, and students in the Kuomintang-controlled areas are still suffering in deep water and scorching heat. We should make our greatest efforts to support the Liberation War, shorten their suffering process, and vow to avenge our dead comrades and suffering partners." The Federation of Student Associations of Northeast University made a suggestion to compatriots across the country and the People's Government in a protest letter: order the arrest of the murderers of the workers, Tang Enbo and Chen Daqing, and bring them to justice. Shanghai student representatives who had just arrived in Beiping to attend the National Student Congress said sadly: "The workers and students of Shanghai have always been at the forefront of the struggle together. The persecution suffered by the workers is more than that suffered by the students, and even more bitter. The sacrifice of these three worker comrades makes us remember all the workers and students who are still living under Kuomintang rule and suffering persecution. May they be liberated soon!"

　　战犯汤恩伯惨杀沪交通工人 　 北平人民愤怒抗议
    咸认必须严厉惩处凶手战犯
    【新华社北平廿一日电】国民党匪帮枪杀上海交通工人顾伯康、钟泉周、王元三人的消息传到此间后，激起了北平人民极大的义愤。工人们和学生们认为：此次上海惨案，进一步证明国民党反动派的和平阴谋是为了拖延时间、准备战争的骗人的烟幕。为了取得真正和平，替死难工人报仇，必须坚决惩办战争罪犯。长辛店铁路工人听到自己弟兄被敌人残杀的消息时，情绪极为激动。参加过“二七”斗争的老工人杨宝嵩激昂地说：“打死工人的，一定要办！看汤恩伯、陈大庆这两个刽子手跑到那里去！”石景山钢铁厂工人知道了这个消息后，立即召开会议，会上一致认为工人要彻底解放，必须坚决支持人民政府，打垮反动派，为英勇的牺牲者报仇。该厂职工会筹备会已发出文告，号召已经得到解放的北平工人为支援国民党反动统治下的工人弟兄而斗争。平津区铁路局职工联谊会、妇女会以及西直门铁路员工互助会，也发出通电，号召全国职工们团结起来，加紧生产，支援解放军，解放上海，活捉凶手汤恩伯和陈大庆。北平电车职工筹备会写信慰问上海罢工工人，并向北平全体职工建议联合召开追悼会，誓为死者报仇。冀北电力公司的职工们的主张是“血债必须用血来还”。三轮车夫任礼说：“汤恩伯和许惠东的命运是一样的，迟早要受到人民的审判。”北平学生们亦纷纷表示抗议。师范大学自治会发表声明说：“我们曾尝过国民党反动派的迫害是什么滋味，我们在解放了的今天，才更加感到民主自由的可贵和可爱。国民党统治区的工、农、学生还在水深火热中苦苦煎熬，我们应当拿出最大的努力支援解放战争，缩短他们的痛苦过程，并誓为死难的战友、受苦的伙伴报仇。”东北大学社团联合会在抗议书上向全国同胞及人民政府提出建议：下令缉拿这次屠杀工人的凶手汤恩伯和陈大庆归案法办。刚到北平出席全国学生代表大会的上海学生代表沉痛地说：“上海的工人和学生从来是一起在斗争的最前线，工人遭受的迫害比学生更多，更苦。这次三位工人战友的牺牲，使我们怀念现在还生活在国民党统治下遭受迫害的一切工人和同学。愿他们早日得到解放！”
