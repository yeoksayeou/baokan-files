　　Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 14th: TASS, New York dispatch: American stock trading fell again on the 10th, nearly reaching the lowest level in a year (based on the lowest point of $63.40 per share on November 24th of last year). The stocks of many important companies, such as U.S. Steel, DuPont, General Motors, and Standard Oil of New Jersey, fell by at least $2 per share. Grain prices rose slightly on the 10th, but wholesale cotton prices in Chicago continued to fall.
　　According to a United Press dispatch: The New York Central Railroad announced on the 9th the largest layoff since the economic crisis of 1929, with approximately 8,100 machine repair and track maintenance workers receiving notices of temporary layoffs over the weekend. At the same time, the Pennsylvania Railroad also announced the layoff of 2,500 track maintenance workers last week. The Central Railroad announced that the reason for the layoffs was that passenger and freight traffic had decreased by 10 percent since last year, which means that the company has felt the impact of the reduction in American trade activity since last year. Prior to this, the company had announced the closure of six locomotive and four railcar repair shops, because many locomotives and railcars are now abandoned in warehouses.

　　美股票价格续跌
  　各铁路公司大批解雇工人
    【新华社陕北十四日电】塔斯社纽约讯：美国股票交易十日再行下跌，几达一年来之最低水平（按去年十一月廿四日之最低点为每股平均六十三元四角美金），许多重要公司如美国钢公司、杜邦公司、通用汽车公司及新泽西美孚油公司的股票，每股至少下跌了两美元。谷物价格十日略形回涨，但芝加哥之棉花批发价格则仍然下跌。
    另据合众社讯：纽约中央铁路公司九日宣布了一九二九年经济危机以来的最大一次解雇，约有八千一百名修理机器及养路工人，接到周末暂时解雇的通知。同时，宾夕凡尼亚铁路公司亦宣布上周解雇养路工人二千五百人。中央铁路公司宣布解雇原因是去年以来客货车行驶已下降百分之十，这就意味着该公司从去年以来，已感受到美国贸易活动减少的影响。在此之前，该公司曾宣布停闭六个机车及四个车皮修理所，因为现在有许多机车与车皮废置在仓库中。
