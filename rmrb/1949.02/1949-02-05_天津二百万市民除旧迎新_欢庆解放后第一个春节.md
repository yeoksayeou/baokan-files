Xinhua News Agency, Tianjin, 3rd: Two million Tianjin citizens are welcoming the first Spring Festival after liberation with joyous hearts. On New Year's Eve, thousands of homes were brightly lit, and the bustling streets were thronged with people. Workers spent New Year's Eve in revelry. "Plum blossoms smile to welcome the new democracy, and the spring breeze brings songs of liberation." This couplet, created by the workers themselves, was posted on the front of the Zhongfang factory for the first time. Thanks to the swift issuance of the Military Control Commission's decision on employee salaries, all state-owned factories and technical agencies have paid their employees. Many workers have already bought their New Year's goods. When a worker from the Tianjin branch of the Hebei Electric Power Company returned home from the market with a bag of meat, he said with satisfaction: "This time, it's the workers' turn to celebrate the New Year!" To celebrate the new life after liberation, many factories held dinners and parties. Employees of the French Electric Power Company even performed Yangko dances at the party. Zhang Yisan, an old machine worker, said excitedly: "It hasn't been this lively in twenty-seven years. In the past, it was 'heartache'; now, it's peace of mind." Many college and middle school students held joint New Year's Eve parties with the People's Liberation Army. The auditorium of Nankai University was filled with singing, and the play "Brother and Sister Reclaiming Wasteland" was performed. The school's ironworkers, drama club, Nanyan, and Nankai News Agency and other organizations held evening gatherings to talk about life and learning. Major companies and stores were crowded with customers preparing for New Year's goods. The business of dried fruits and fresh goods was particularly good, and merchants felt that business was better than in the past. A shopkeeper in Huali Lane, District One, said: "This year, the police don't want New Year's gifts, and there are no miscellaneous taxes. It's truly a new atmosphere of liberation."
	On New Year's Day, on Roosevelt Road, the Tianjin office of the Preparatory Committee of the North China Federation of Trade Unions put up a new couplet with red background and white characters at the entrance of the London Hotel: "Develop production, prosper the economy, consider both public and private interests, benefit both labor and capital; build a people's city, workers and staff, unite closely, work actively, support the war, and accelerate the victory of the whole country." It hung straight down from the third floor to the ground floor. On Liberation Bridge (formerly known as the International Bridge), a unit of the People's Liberation Army, led by military music, marched along the Haihe River towards Hua'an Street in neat steps. Many Yangko teams and propaganda teams passed through the streets, giving their first performances of the new year. The entrances of factories such as Zhongfang, Steel, and Water and Electricity were all decorated with brightly colored archways. Each factory was closed for the holidays as in the past. The workers' residential areas were full of joy and jubilation. When the reporter entered the home of Qi Zhemin, a worker at the Zhongfang No. 2 Factory, his mother was steaming steamed buns. She said to her son: "Our government works really quickly. The wages were all paid out overnight. This is truly letting us celebrate this year of liberation!" Many refugees received relief from the People's Government and were no longer suffering from hunger and cold. Liu Furong, a refugee from Dongjuzi, had his house completely demolished and burned by the Kuomintang bandit troops. His wife said: "If our government hadn't given my family seventy-five catties of relief grain, how could we have survived this year!" Liu Furong himself said that he plans to borrow money from the government to continue making leather shoes, actively produce, and rebuild his home.

　　天津二百万市民除旧迎新
  　欢庆解放后第一个春节
    【新华社天津三日电】天津二百万市民以欢愉心情迎接解放后的第一个春节。除夕万家灯火，闹市游人云集。职工们，在狂欢中渡过除夕。“梅花笑迎新民主，春风送来解放歌”，这首由工人们自己创作的对联，第一次被贴在中纺工厂门首。由于军管会对于职工薪资决定的迅速下达，所有公营工厂及技术机关已发下薪资，许多工人早已办好年货。当冀北电力公司天津分公司的一个工人从市上办得一蒲包肉返回家时，满意地说：“这回该着工人过过年了！”为了庆祝解放后的新的生活，许多工厂都举行聚餐和晚会，法商电力公司的职工且在晚会上演出秧歌舞。老机器工人张义三兴奋地说：“二十七年没这样热闹过了。过去是‘揪心’，现在是顺心了。”许多大中学生，在除夕日与人民解放军举行联欢晚会，南开大学礼堂内洋溢着歌声，并上演了“兄妹开荒”。该校铁工、剧艺社、南雁和南开新闻社等社团举行夜会，漫谈生活与学习。各大公司和商店为筹办年货的顾客所挤满，干果和鲜货的生意特别好，商人们感到买卖比过去好做。一区华利里一公馆掌柜说：“今年警察也不要节礼了，杂捐没有了，真是解放的新气象。”
    元旦，在罗斯福路，华北总工会筹委会驻津办事处于伦敦大饭店门首，布起红底白字新联：“发展生产，繁荣经济，公私兼顾，劳资两利；建设人民城市，工人职员，亲密团结，积极劳动，支援战争，加速全国胜利。”从三层楼上直悬至楼下。在解放桥（原万国桥），人民解放军一部以军乐为先导，以整齐的步伐沿海河岸向华安街前进。许多秧歌队和宣传队从街上穿过，作新的年度的第一次演出。中纺、钢铁、水电等各工厂门口，都高搭着鲜色的彩牌坊。各厂按旧例放假。在工人住宅区充满快乐与欢腾。当记者步入中纺二厂工人齐哲民的家里时，他的母亲正在蒸馒头，她和他的儿子说：“咱们政府办事真马利（快的意思），一夜工夫工资就全发下来了，这是真心叫咱们过这个解放年！”许多难民受到人民政府的救济，不再啼饥号寒。东局子难民刘福荣，房子全被国民党匪军拆烧。他的妻子说：“要不是咱们政府发给我家七十五斤救济粮，怎么过这年呀！”刘福荣自己表示他打算向政府贷款，仍旧制皮鞋，积极生产，重建家业。
