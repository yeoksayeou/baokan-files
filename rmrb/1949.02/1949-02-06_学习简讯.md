　　Learning Briefs
    △To strengthen the learning of on-the-job cadres, Huolu County has formally established a General Study Committee, and branch study committees have been established in each agency. The branch study committees are divided into Group A and Group B according to the cadres' political and cultural level. The branch study committees meet once a month and report to the General Study Committee after the meeting. In order to encourage everyone's learning enthusiasm, each unit has prepared notebooks, pencils, and books as learning prizes. To solve the learning problems of cadres with low cultural levels, each agency has also organized spare-time supplementary schools. 　(Wang Da)
