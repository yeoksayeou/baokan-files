In June 1923, the JCP was destroyed, and Tokuda was arrested and imprisoned. After being released from prison eight months later, he immediately began rebuilding the party. Tokuda was also the founder of the left-wing trade union and enjoys extremely high prestige among Japanese workers. From 1928, when the JCP suffered major damage, until Japan's defeat and surrender in World War II in 1945, Tokuda waged an eighteen-year struggle in the prisons of the reactionaries with unwavering integrity. After his release from prison, he was elected as a member of the Central Committee and General Secretary of the Secretariat of the Political Bureau at the Fourth Congress of the JCP in December 1945. In April 1947, he was elected as a member of the House of Representatives in the second district of Tokyo with more than 70,000 votes.

In 1925, the General Federation of Labor split into progressive and right-wing factions, and he was the leader of the progressive faction. In the 1930s, he was arrested more than ten times, imprisoned three times, and spent four years in prison.
