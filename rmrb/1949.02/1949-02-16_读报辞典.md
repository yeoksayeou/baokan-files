　　Italian General Confederation of Labour – Founded in January 1945, it then had 4.5 million members. By the end of 1947, membership had increased to 7 million, belonging to 57 trade unions. Since its establishment, the Italian General Confederation of Labour has been under the leadership of the Italian Communist Party and the Socialist Party (the leadership committee of the General Confederation originally had 38 communists, 20 socialists, 11 grassroots Christian Democrats, and 2 Saragat followers), and has continuously fought against right-wing trade union members headed by Saragat. In June 1947, right-wing elements proposed reactionary opinions to the General Confederation, such as "not allowing the General Confederation to interfere in purely political issues" and restricting the activities of the General Confederation to the scope of economic struggle. However, these proposals were immediately met with strong opposition, and the progressive forces of the General Confederation became even more united. The Saragat faction, under the command of American imperialism, withdrew from the General Confederation and formed another trade union in an attempt to split the strength of the Italian working class, but only managed to pull away 15,000 people from the 7 million-strong General Confederation, resulting in a shameful failure.
　　Bangka Island – Also known as Wangka Island, it is an island belonging to Sumatra in the Asian East Indies, located in the southeast of Sumatra. The island is currently ruled by Dutch imperialism. The total area of the island is 1,178 square kilometers. The island is mostly hilly, with the highest point being a granite land of about 510 meters. The lowlands are composed of iron-containing red soil, and the land is fertile. The island is most famous for its tin production.
　　Madras Province – Is a province of "Hindustan," located on the southeast coast of the Indian peninsula. Its provincial capital is Madras City, where the local government and other offices are located. The city was not originally a good harbor, but after British imperialism invaded India, it was managed by British imperialism and could now dock large ships, exporting mainly cotton. There are universities and higher normal schools in the city, giving it the name of "Academic City" of India.
