The New Task of History
　　Entrusted to the Soldiers
　　Letter from the County Magistrate of Zhengding to the Soldiers

Dear Comrades of the People's Liberation Army:

　　The New Year of 1949 has passed, and this year will be the year of the final victory of the People's Liberation War. The rapid development of the current situation is inseparable from your efforts. I hope you will work hard to advance, make persistent efforts, and bring about the victory of the people's democratic revolution quickly!

　　In the past year, thanks to the correct leadership of the Party Central Committee, you have fought hard and liberated the entire Northeast, laying the foundation for the victory of the liberation of all of China. You also advanced into the interior, joining forces with the North China Liberation Army. You first liberated Luanzhou, and then cleared out strongholds such as Tanggu and the periphery of Tianjin and Beijing, isolating the Chiang Kai-shek troops in Tianjin and Beijing. Subsequently, under your highly skilled command and siege, you liberated Tianjin, the largest industrial city in North China, and Beijing, the ancient cultural city. On behalf of all the cadres and 280,000 people of Zhengding County, I would like to extend our sincere greetings and high respect to you.

　　Comrades! The new tasks that history has brought us in 1949 are entrusted to you. I hope that you will continue to carry forward the spirit of liberating the Northeast and Tianjin and Beijing, fight to Central and South China, resolutely, thoroughly, cleanly, and completely eliminate the bandit troops, and liberate all of China. Strive to build a new China that is independent, democratic, free, unified, and prosperous!

　　　　　　　　　　　　County Magistrate of Zhengding　Li Guohua

　　历史的新任务
  　寄托在将士们的身上
  　正定县长写给将士们的信亲爱的解放军全体同志们：
    一九四九年的新年已经过去了，今年将是人民解放战争最后胜利的一年，目前形势的飞速发展，是与你们分不开的。希望你们努力前进，再接再厉，使人民民主革命的胜利迅速到来！
    在过去的一年间，由于在党中央的正确领导下，你们坚苦奋斗，解放了全东北，打下了解放全中国的胜利基础。又挺进关内，与华北解放军会师。首先解放滦洲，紧接着扫清了塘沽，平津外围等据点。使平津蒋军陷于孤立。继在你们高度艺术的指挥围攻下，将华北最大的工业城市天津及文化古城北平全部解放。我代表正定县全体干部及全县二十八万群众谨向你们致以亲切的慰问和崇高的敬意。
    同志们！一九四九年的历史给我们带来的新任务，寄托在你们的身上。望你们继续以解放东北与平津的精神，打到华中华南去，坚决、彻底、干净、全部的消灭匪军，解放全中国。为建立一个独立，民主、自由，统一、富强的新中国而奋斗！
  　　　　　　　　　正定县长　李国华
