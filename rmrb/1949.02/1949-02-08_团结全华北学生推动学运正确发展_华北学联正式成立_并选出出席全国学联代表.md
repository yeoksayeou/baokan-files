  　Implement the Education Plan with Students' Conscious Actions
    [Special Dispatch from This Newspaper] In order to meet the needs of the current revolutionary situation and revolutionary tasks, to unite all North China students to establish their own organization, to strengthen cultural and political learning, and to promote the correct development of the student movement in the future, North China students convened the First Representative Congress in Shijiazhuang a few days ago, formally establishing the North China Student Federation, and elected representatives to attend the upcoming National Student Federation.
    The congress lasted six days. A total of eighty-four representatives attended, including representatives from various administrative regions (except Hebei-Shandong-Henan, Hebei East), Shijiazhuang and Yangquan cities, and five directly affiliated schools such as North China University,财经学院 [University of Finance and Economics],交通学院 [Jiaotong University], Medical University, and Yucai Middle School, as well as sixteen units including representatives from Peking University, Tsinghua University, and Peking University Agricultural College in the Beiping district, who rushed to the meeting on the third day after the opening.
    The congress was always filled with vigorous vitality. Representatives from various regions brought different experiences of struggle to converge and exchange here. Particularly outstanding were the representatives attending this congress, most of whom were children of the working people, and the entire congress was filled with the spirit of serving the people with loyalty. Liu Zhongying, a female representative from Jinzhong, described at the opening ceremony the feelings of the children of workers and peasants who had completely turned over after the land reform with her own experience. She said: "My family didn't have an acre of land before. Now I can study and attend this congress. Not only could I not have dreamed of it, but even my ancestors probably never dreamed of it. This is all given to me by the Communist Party. I will definitely guarantee to study hard so that I can serve the people in the future."
    The congress first listened to the speeches of Zhou Yang, Minister of Propaganda of the North China Bureau of the CPC Central Committee, and Chao Zhefu, Minister of Education of the North China People's Government. After analyzing the current revolutionary situation, Comrade Zhou Yang pointed out that after the liberation of Tianjin and Beiping, the entire North China region has been basically liberated. The task facing all the people of North China is to conduct production and construction on a planned and large-scale basis, develop culture and education, and support the revolutionary war, making North China a strong rear area for the national revolutionary war. Therefore, the students now have better conditions for learning, and the children of the working people have more opportunities to receive education. The task of the students in the future is to intensify their studies without relaxing for a moment, learning culture, learning politics, and learning technology. They must make their learning keep up with the needs of the revolutionary war and national construction; integrate learning with the people's liberation struggle; make learning a conscious action of every student; and establish a realistic, truth-seeking learning viewpoint and attitude of serving the people. Minister Chao's speech focused on the main content of the education policy stipulated by the North China People's Government: how to strengthen the learning of culture, science, and politics, how to strengthen regular systems, and how to combine book learning with practice.
    On the second day of the congress, after the presidium of the congress received the news that representatives from Yanjing University, Tsinghua University, and Peking University Agricultural College in the Beiping district were rushing to the meeting, the congress temporarily adjourned to wait for them with great pleasure and enthusiasm. The six representatives from the Beiping district arrived on the morning of the third day, and a welcome meeting was held that afternoon. At the meeting, representatives from Beiping and representatives from the old liberated areas unanimously emphasized that they should learn from each other and unite in the future. When the Beiping representatives read the letter from the students of the three schools to the representatives of the congress, the whole audience applauded warmly. The letter said: In the past, we were originally one family, but the reactionary rule of Chiang Kai-shek's Kuomintang broke us up. Today, under the victorious offensive of the People's Liberation Army, we are reunited again. We will work harder to study in the future and combine with the workers and peasants.
    The congress then listened to Comrade Lu Ping of the North China Youth Federation's report on the principles and tasks of the North China student movement. Comrade Lu Ping first pointed out that the North China student movement has played a significant role in every revolutionary historical period for more than ten years. He said: In the vast North China liberated area, more than 90% of the working people have become masters of the country, and the vast majority of students in the liberated area come from the families of the working people. The significant achievements made by the students in the liberated area in supporting the front, land reform, and production propaganda are inseparable from the achievements of the Chinese people's revolution. It is particularly worth mentioning that over the past ten years, the North China liberated area has cultivated a large number of revolutionary intellectuals who have poured into various fronts. Incomplete statistics show that 30,000 students have participated in various jobs in the three years since the People's Liberation War. At the same time, the student movement against hunger, persecution, and American imperialism in the Kuomintang-controlled areas also played a significant role in the broad people's revolutionary movement in the Kuomintang areas. Although the content and form of these two are different, they are both fighting for the common goal of the New Democratic Revolution. Then, he pointed out with extremely excited words: Today, these two torrents have converged, and they will rush to the whole country with a more turbulent attitude. This congress has divided the new period of the North China student movement. He concluded that the reason why the North China students have been able to grow so rapidly and gain freedom and liberation is first of all thanks to the Communist Party that leads the Chinese people's revolution and the great mentor of youth, Comrade Mao Zedong. Regarding the principles and tasks of the student movement in the future, Comrade Lu Ping believes that under the general line of the New Democratic Revolution and the new situation, the most important task of all North China youth and students at present is to strengthen their studies in order to realize and build a New Democratic New China, improve themselves a hundredfold, and become a strong reserve force for the country. Every young student must arm himself with Marxism-Leninism—Mao Zedong Thought, learn the position, viewpoints, and methods of Marxism-Leninism, and establish a revolutionary outlook on life. Only by mastering the weapon of Marxism-Leninism can we correctly choose all scientific knowledge that is useful for the new society and the people's revolutionary cause. The purpose of our study is not for personal glory and wealth, but to serve the people, to devote our young wisdom to the working people, and to devote ourselves to the people's country. Therefore, our study is conscious and joyful, not blind and reluctant. No matter what class origin students come from, as long as they establish such a learning viewpoint of serving the people and strive to transform and improve themselves, they will all become useful talents of the new China and be valued by the people. We must eliminate the poison that the old society has given to young people, that is, the erroneous view of studying only for one's own small interests. Ancient and modern history, both Chinese and foreign, have vividly taught us: If intellectuals leave the working people, they will inevitably follow the reactionary ruling class to their death and will never have their own way out. All students must develop the consciousness and creativity of learning in order to realize the educational policies and plans stipulated by the government and schools. Students in the new and old areas should unite and work hard to study culture and politics in order to complete the tasks given to us by the Chinese people and cultivate ourselves into useful talents for the New Democratic Republic.
    After Comrade Lu Ping's report, the representatives attending the meeting were divided into several groups for discussion. During the discussion, after heated review and discussion on issues such as how to study and for whom to study, everyone unanimously agreed that they should first eliminate all ideas of studying for personal purposes and firmly establish the learning viewpoint of serving the people.
    Comrade Feng Wenbin, Director of the Chinese Liberated Areas Youth Federation, attended the meeting and gave a report on the nature and tasks of the student union, briefly stating: In schools led by the People's Government, the interests of the school authorities and the students are completely consistent. However, the student union is a mass organization and should maintain its organizational independence; it has the right to criticize and make suggestions on the school's administration, and assist the school's administrative measures. At the same time, it should accept the guidance of the school authorities and respond to and implement the school's administrative calls. The school authorities have the responsibility to guide the student union, but cannot order or interfere with the student union. In general, the student union and the school administration are both working around the goal of "making the students learn better." It is wrong to violate this goal. Comrade Feng Wenbin emphasized that students should use conscious actions to implement the education plan.
    On the fourth day, the congress entered the agenda of discussing various proposals. The North China Student Federation Constitution, the Executive Committee Election Law, the National Student Federation Representative Election Law, several suggestions to the Education Department of the North China People's Government on school facilities, and proposals to send telegrams to Chairman Mao and the CPC Central Committee, Commander-in-Chief Zhu and all commanders and fighters of the People's Liberation Army, the North China People's Government, and students in Beiping and Tianjin were discussed and passed. During the discussion of the Executive Committee Election Law, most representatives believed that in order to make the students in the new and old areas unite better, the Executive Committee should better connect with all students in decision-making and have full comprehensiveness, and be able to take into account the different situations in the vast rural and urban areas. The Executive Committee's election law should take into account the region and the proportion of people. After heated discussion and debate, the congress passed the election of the Executive Committee by administrative region, municipality directly under the Central Government, and North China directly affiliated schools (all directly affiliated schools are combined into one constituency) as units and in proportion to the number of people. As a result, the following were elected: North China directly affiliated school unit: Chen Lin (North China University), He Weihan (Jizhong District), Wang Xianmin (Jinan District), Li Linshu (Beiyue District), Li Guirong (Taihang District), Li Xiulin (Taiyue District), He Hongshen (Jinzhong District), Beiping District: Wang Hu (Tsinghua University), Xie Daoyuan (Yanjing University), Liu Heshi (Peking University Agricultural College), Ma Xiuhua (Shijiazhuang, Yangquan City), etc., were elected as members of the first Executive Committee of the North China Student Federation. Vacancies in Beiping, Tianjin, Jidong, and Hebei-Shandong-Henan will be filled in the future in accordance with the regulations. The congress also passed a resolution that each of the three units of Tsinghua, Yanjing, and Peking University Agricultural College should recommend one representative to serve as the temporary Executive Committee member in the Beiping District.
    Regarding the representatives attending the National Student Federation, they were recommended by each unit and passed by the congress, and the following 26 people were elected: Shao Min, Zhu Guozhang, and Luo Lin. Other units in Tianjin, new districts, and Hebei East, and Hebei-Shandong-Henan can be re-elected in the future in accordance with the notice of the Chinese Liberated Areas Youth Federation, but must be approved by the Standing Committee.
    At the closing ceremony, the eleven members of the first Executive Committee of the North China Student Federation were sworn in publicly amidst the cheers of the representatives. They said in a voice as firm as steel: "Under the New Democratic education policy, we will resolutely strive to complete the tasks entrusted by the congress and serve the students wholeheartedly." The congress successfully concluded amidst the enthusiastic shouts of the representatives: "Unite all North China students!" "Unite all Chinese students!" "Long live the North China Student Federation!" "Long live the victory of the New Democratic construction!" and "Long live the Communist Party of China!" "Long live Chairman Mao!"
    "Another Dispatch" After the close of the congress, the first Executive Committee of the North China Student Federation immediately held its first meeting, and elected the following six units as the Standing Committee: Jinzhong (He Hongshen), Jizhong (He Weihan), Beiyue (Li Linshu), Tsinghua University in Beiping District (Wang Hu), Yanjing (Xie Daoyuan), and North China University in North China Directly Affiliated School Unit (Chen Lin).

    冯文彬同志指出

    【本报特讯】为适应当前革命形势与革命任务的需要，团结全华北学生成立自己的组织，用以加强文化、政治的学习及推动今后学运的正确发展，华北学生特于日前在石家庄召开第一届代表大会，正式成立了华北学生联合会，推选出了出席即将召开的全国学联的代表。
    大会历时六日。共出席代表八十四人，包括各行政区（缺冀鲁豫、冀东），石家庄、阳泉两市和华北大学、财经学院、交通学院、医科大学、育才中学等五直属学校，以及大会揭幕后第三天才兼程赶到的北平区燕京大学、清华大学、北京大学农学院等三院校代表共十六单位。
    大会始终洋溢着蓬勃的朝气，来自各区的代表们，带来了各种不同的斗争经验在这儿汇合交流。特别出色的是出席这次大会的代表们，多半是劳动人民的子弟，整个大会充满了忠诚为人民服务的精神。晋中女代表刘中英在揭幕会上，以亲身的经历描述了在土地改革后彻底翻了身的工农子女的心情。她说：“俺家里原先一亩地也没有，我现在能念书，能出席这次大会，不但我梦想不到，就连俺祖宗恐怕也没梦到过。这都是共产党给我的，我一定保证好好学习，将来好为人民服务。”
    大会最先听取了中共中央华北局宣传部长周扬和华北人民政府教育部晁哲甫部长的讲话。周扬同志在分析目前革命形势之后，指出平津解放后，华北全境已基本解放，摆在全华北人民面前的任务是有计划地大规模地进行生产建设，发展文化教育，支援革命战争，使华北成为全国革命战争的强固后方。因此同学们今后就有了更好的条件进行学习，劳动人民的子女就有了更多的受教育的机会。同学们今后的任务就是一刻也不放松地加紧自己的学习，学文化、学政治、学技术，必须使学习能赶上革命战争与国家建设的需要；使学习与人民解放斗争结合起来；使学习成为每个同学的自觉的行动，确立实事求是、为人民服务的学习观点与学习态度。晁部长的讲话着重说明华北人民政府所规定的教育方针的主要内容：关于如何加强文化、科学和政治的学习，如何加强正规制度，以及书本的学习如何与实际结合等问题。
    大会进行至第二天，大会主席团接获北平区燕京、清华、及北大农学院三院校代表兼程赶来的消息后，大会临时休会以极大的愉快和热忱等待他们。北平区的六位代表在第三天上午赶到，当天下午就举行了欢迎会。会上，北平代表和老解放区代表一致强调今后要互相学习，团结一致。当北平代表朗读三校同学给大会代表们的信时，全场热烈鼓掌。信上说：过去我们本来是一家，蒋介石国民党反动统治把我们拆散了。今天，在解放军的胜利进攻下，又使我们团圆了。我们今后当加倍努力学习并和工农大众结合起来。
    大会继又听取华北青联陆平同志关于华北学生运动的方针与任务的报告。陆平同志首先指出十多年来华北学运在每一革命历史时期中均起了重大的作用。他说：在广大的华北解放区，百分之九十以上的劳动人民，已成为国家的主人，解放区学生中极大多数是来自劳动人民的家庭。解放区同学在支援前线、土改、生产宣传等工作中表现出来的重大成绩，是和中国人民革命业绩分不开的。特别值得提出的，是十多年以来，华北解放区培养了大批革命知识分子，涌入各个战线中去，仅人民解放战争三年以来的不完全的统计，即有三万同学参加各种工作。同时在蒋管区如火如荼的反饥饿、反迫害与反对美国帝国主义的学生运动，在蒋区的广大人民革命运动中，也起了重大的作用。这两者在内容与形式上虽有不同，但他们都是为着新民主主义革命的一致目标而奋斗着。接着他以极兴奋的语句指出：今天这两股洪流汇合了，它将以更汹涌的姿态奔向全国。这次大会就划分了华北学运的新时期。他总结华北同学之所以能够这样迅速地成长和获得自由解放，首先应该感谢领导中国人民革命的共产党以及青年伟大的导师毛泽东同志。关于今后学运的方针和任务，陆平同志认为：在新民主主义革命的总路线与新形势下，全华北青年学生当前最主要的任务，就是要为实现与建设新民主主义新中国而加强自己的学习，百倍的提高自己，成为国家强大的后备力量。每个青年学生都必须以马克思列宁主义——毛泽东思想武装自己，学习马列主义的立场观点与方法，树立革命的人生观。只有掌握了马列主义的武器，才能正确的去选择对于新社会与人民革命事业有用的一切科学知识。我们学习的目的不是为了个人的荣华富贵，而是要为人民服务，要把我们年青的智慧，尽忠于劳动人民，尽忠于人民的国家。因此我们的学习是自觉的、愉快的，而不是盲目的、勉强的。不管任何阶级出身的同学，只要树立了这样为人民服务的学习观点，而去努力改造与提高自己，将都成为新中国的有用人材，而被人民所看重。我们必须清除旧社会所给予青年的毒害，即那种只为自己渺小利益而学习的错误观点。中外古今的历史都鲜明地教训了我们：知识分子如果离开了劳动人民，就必然的要追随反动的统治阶级走向死亡，将永远没有自己的出路。所有同学都必须发扬学习的自觉性、创造性，以实现政府与学校所规定的教育方针和计划。新老区同学应团结一致，努力学习文化，学习政治，以完成中国人民给予我们的任务，培养自己成为新民主主义共和国的有用人材。
    陆平同志报告后，到会代表分成若干小组进行讨论。在讨论时对如何学习及为谁学习等问题，大家经过热烈检讨和讨论之后，一致认为首先应肃清一切为个人打算而学习的观念，坚决树立为人民服务的学习观点。
    中国解放区青年联合会主任冯文彬同志莅会做了关于学生会性质与任务的报告，略称：在人民政府领导的学校里，学校当局和同学的利益是完全一致的。但学生会是群众组织，应保持其组织上的独立性；它有权对学校行政上进行批评、建议，并协助学校的行政措施。同时它应接受学校当局的指导，响应与执行学校行政号召。学校当局对学生会有指导的责任，但不能命令和干涉学生会。总起来说，学生会与学校行政方面都是围绕“使同学们学的更好”这样一个目标工作。违及了这目标就是错误的。冯文彬同志强调用同学们自觉的行动去实现教育计划。
    第四天，大会即进入讨论各项提案议程。当即讨论通过了华北学生联合会章程，执委选举法，出席全国学联代表选举法，对华北人民政府教育部的几项关于学校设施的建议及致电毛主席和中共中央、朱总司令和人民解放军全体指战员、华北人民政府及平津同学等各项提案。在讨论执委选举法时，多数代表认为：为了使新老区同学们团结得更好，执委会更好的联系全体同学在决策并具有充分的全面性，时能照顾到广大的乡村与城市的不同情况，执委的选举法应照顾到地区和人数比例，经过热烈的讨论和争辩后，大会通过以各行政区、各直辖市和华北直属学校（所有直属学校合为一个选区）为单位与按照人数比例推选执委。结果选出：华北直属学校单位：华北大学（陈林）、冀中区（何维汉）、冀南区（王献民）、北岳区（李磷书）、太行区（李贵荣）、太岳区（李秀林）、晋中区（贺洪深）、北平区：清华大学（王浒）、燕京大学（谢道渊）、北京大学农学院（刘河石）、石家庄、阳泉市（马秀华）等十一人为华北学生联合会第一届执行委员会委员。其余北平、天津、冀东、冀鲁豫等地缺额，照会章规定由以后补行推选。大会并通过由清华、燕京、北农三单位各推代表一人为北平区临时执委。
    关于出席全国学联代表，由各单位推举，大会通过，选出：邵敏、朱国璋、罗林等二十六人。其他平津、新区各单位，及冀东、冀鲁豫人选，以后可按中国解放区青联通告进行补选，但须经常委会批准。
    闭幕会上，华北学联第一届的十一位执委们在代表们的欢呼声中当众宣誓就职，他们以钢铁般坚定的声音同声说：“在新民主主义教育方针下，我们坚决为完成大会交付的任务而努力，全心全意为同学服务”。大会在代表们满怀热情的高呼着：“全华北同学团结起来！”“全中国同学团结起来！”“华北学联万岁！”“新民主主义建设胜利万岁！”及“中国共产党万岁！”“毛主席万岁！”声中胜利闭幕。
    “又讯”大会闭幕后，华北学联第一届执委会立即召开首次会议，选出：晋中（贺洪深）、冀中（何维汉）、北岳（李磷书）、北平区清华大学（王浒）、燕京（谢道渊）、及华北直属学校单位华北大学（陈林）等六单位为常务委员会。
