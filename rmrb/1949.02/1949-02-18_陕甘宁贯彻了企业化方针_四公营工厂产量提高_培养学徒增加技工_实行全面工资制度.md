Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, 16th: The output and quality of agricultural implements, matches, chemicals, and paper produced by the four factories under the Industry and Cooperative Office of the Construction Department of the Shaanxi-Gansu-Ningxia Border Region Government have increased over the past four months, and costs have been reduced. This is a result of these four factories implementing the enterprise management principles for public factories decided upon at the Border Region Factory Directors Joint Conference last year. Currently, the average daily production of iron plows by the foundry workers at the agricultural implements factory has increased by 62% compared to four months ago, and the amount of molten iron per furnace has increased by more than 50%. The cast iron parts for the carts produced by the factory have become stronger and more durable due to the addition of two-thirds wrought iron. The loss rate in casting plows has decreased from 30% to 8%. The amount of unusable coal discarded during coke production has decreased from a maximum of 47% to 13%. The match production at the match factory has increased month by month, with December's output being 400% of September's. The soap produced by the chemical factory has regained its pre-war quality and is selling well again. The factory has also adopted the experience of the Jin-Sui soap factory and switched to the glycerol production method, thereby saving 15% of raw materials. The average weight of each ream of Malan paper produced by the paper factory has decreased from 25.9 jin to 25 jin, gradually reducing the amount of second-class paper. The product costs of all the above factories, calculated in real terms, have decreased compared to four months ago. The phenomenon of producing certain products without regard to actual market needs has also been corrected.

The fundamental reason for achieving the above results is that the factories have paid attention to studying issues such as production organization, management methods, and economic accounting based on the enterprise management principles for public factories decided upon at the Border Region Factory Directors Joint Conference last year. They have also identified problems and resolved them in a timely manner, enabling factory operations to move forward greatly on the path of enterprise management. After the Factory Directors Joint Conference, the match factory immediately inspected its work based on the spirit of enterprise management and found as many as eight unreasonable or wasteful phenomena in September, which were immediately corrected. When testing how much Malan grass should be steamed per pot, how much coal and fuel should be used, and how much labor was required for each production process, the main cadres of the paper factory personally participated in supervision and guidance in order to obtain accurate figures on which to base planned production. The agricultural implements factory merged the coking coal team into the coal mining factory and moved it to a location near the coal factory, saving a huge amount of raw material transportation costs. During the relocation of the chemical factory, it continued production while repairing and building factory buildings, minimizing lost work time. In terms of technical improvement, the old method of producing glycerol at the factory required more than 10 jin of old sesame oil per pound, but the current boiling and washing method only requires 8 to 9 jin of old sesame oil. The manufacturing method is also simpler than before. Another reason is that the factories have made achievements in training apprentices to increase the number of skilled workers. For example, four apprentices at the agricultural implements factory have been promoted to skilled workers, and most apprentices can now produce independently, and their output exceeds that of skilled workers. The formulation and implementation of the new comprehensive wage system, as well as necessary material rewards, have greatly increased the workers' enthusiasm for production. For example, the implementation of year-end bonuses at the agricultural implements factory, political education, especially ideological education on enterprise management, and the development of production competition have laid a material and spiritual foundation for the factory's employees to work actively and produce diligently. In terms of leadership relations, the factories have established a regular reporting system to the Industry and Cooperative Office, carefully studied instructions, accepted leadership, and strengthened communication between superiors and subordinates. At the same time, under the unified planning of the Industry and Cooperative Office, the supply and marketing stations, industrial cooperative outposts, and cooperatives have been able to work together to purchase raw materials and sell finished products, eliminating the past disconnection in supply and sales and the delays in capital turnover.

　　陕甘宁贯彻了企业化方针
    四公营工厂产量提高
  　培养学徒增加技工
    实行全面工资制度
    【新华社延安十六日电】陕甘宁边区政府建设厅工业合作社办事处所属农具、火柴、化学、造纸四工厂，四个月来提高了产品的数量和质量，减低了成本。这是由于这四个工厂执行了去年边区厂长联席会关于公营工厂企业化方针的结果。刻农具厂翻砂工人平均每日生产铁铧数量已较四个月前增加百分之六十二，化铁量每炉均比过去增加百分之五十强。该厂所产大车的生铁零件已因加入三分之二的熟铁而坚韧，耐用。铸铧的损失由百分之卅减至百分之八。炼焦炭时选掉的坏炭由过去最高时的百分之四十七减至百分之十三。火柴厂的火柴产量逐月增加，去年十二月份产量为九月份的百分之四百。化学厂所产肥皂，已因恢复战前质量而重新畅销市场；该厂且接受晋绥肥皂厂经验，改用甘油制法，因而节省原料达百分之十五。纸厂所产马兰纸每令平均重量已由二十五斤九两减至二十五斤，使二等纸逐渐减少。以上各厂产品成本若以实物计算，均较四个月前减低。过去某些不按照市场实际需要而生产的现象也已得到纠正。
    获得上述成绩的基本原因，是各厂根据去年边区厂长联席会公营工厂企业化的方针，注意研究了组织生产、管理方法及经济核算等问题。而且发现问题，及时解决，使工厂经营在企业化的道路上大大地前进了一步。火柴厂在厂长联席会结束后，即根据企业化的精神检查工作，发现九月份不合理或浪费现象达八件之多，当即予以纠正。纸厂在试验每锅蒸马兰草若干，用石炭、燃料若干，以至各个生产过程需人工各若干时，均由主要干部亲自参加督导，以便得出精确数字据以有计划地进行生产。农具厂将焦煤组合并于掏炭厂，并搬至煤厂近处生产，节省了巨额的原料运输费。化学厂在迁厂中，一面修盖厂房，一面继续生产，做到最少量的误工。在技术改进方面，该厂旧法制甘油每磅需用老麻油十多斤，现改用煮洗法，仅需老麻油八至九斤。制造方法且较前简单。另外的原因是；培养学徒以增加技工数量，各厂做得均有成绩。如农具厂已有四个学徒提升为技工，大部学徒已可单独生产，且产量有超过技工者。新的全面工资制度的制订与实施，以及必要的物质奖励，大大提高了工人生产情绪。如农具厂年终奖励的实行，政治教育，特别是企业化的思想教育的加强，生产竞赛运动的开展，即为该厂职工的积极工作与努力生产打下了物质与精神的基础。在领导关系上，各厂对工合办事处建立了定期的汇报制度，并认真研究指示，接受领导，加强了上下级的联系。同时在工合统一筹划下，各供销栈、工合据点及合作社均能协力采购原料，销售成品，消除了过去各厂在供销上的脱节和资金周转上的迟滞现象。
