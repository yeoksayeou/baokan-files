　　Ending the War Peacefully
  　Peiping Declares Complete Liberation
    Kuomintang Troops Have All Moved Out of the City to Await Reorganization
    [Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, January 31st] The world-renowned ancient cultural capital, Peiping, with a population of over two million, was declared liberated today. The liberation of Peiping is one of the most important military and political developments in the great Chinese people's revolutionary movement. Peiping, originally defended by approximately 200,000 Kuomintang reactionary troops and their military institutions, is the first example of ending the war peacefully by implementing the eight peace terms announced by Chairman Mao Zedong of the Chinese Communist Party. This event is a result of the People's Liberation Army's immense strength and invincibility, the Kuomintang reactionary troops' widespread demoralization and unwillingness to continue futile resistance, and the unwavering support of the broad masses of the people of Peiping for genuine democracy and peace. The main force of the Kuomintang army in Peiping has now moved to designated locations outside the city, and the People's Liberation Army is scheduled to begin entering the city today to take over defense. The people of Peiping have long yearned for the People's Liberation Army like family. After learning that the People's Liberation Army was about to enter Peiping, the workers, students, and citizens of Peiping busily prepared for a grand welcome ceremony and felt impatient due to repeated postponements of the Kuomintang army's departure from the city. The news that the People's Liberation Army would peacefully enter Peiping gave this ancient city a sudden burst of youthful vitality. Prices suddenly fell from January 23rd. The streets were once again crowded with joyful pedestrians, who were everywhere inquiring about the exact date of the PLA's entry into the city, asking about and spreading the content of the PLA and the Communist Party's propaganda. The peace talks in Peiping had been going on for a long time. In fact, contact had begun from the day the People's Liberation Army surrounded Peiping last December, but until the eve of the liberation of Tianjin, General Fu Zuoyi was unwilling to accept the terms of the People's Liberation Army, thus preventing the negotiations from reaching a result. In the beginning, Fu Zuoyi still dreamed of making a desperate resistance, and then dreamed of leading his troops to escape to Suiyuan, or Taiyuan, or Qingdao, Shanghai, and constantly communicated with Chiang Kai-shek's envoys, taking a perfunctory attitude towards peace talks with the People's Liberation Army. The annihilation of Fu Zuoyi's direct line main force in Xinbao'an and Zhangjiakou, as well as the desperate situation of the entire Kuomintang military and political situation, shook his original plan. On January 14th, CPC Chairman Mao Zedong announced eight peace terms, Tianjin was quickly liberated on the 15th, and on the 16th, Generals Lin Biao and Luo Ronghuan, commanders and political commissars of the People's Liberation Army's Pingjin Front, sent a public letter to Fu Zuoyi regarding the peaceful resolution of Peiping. These events prompted General Fu Zuoyi to decide to accept the PLA's proposal, and the negotiations made progress. The negotiations between the two sides decided that: in order to facilitate the handover and takeover, a seven-member temporary joint committee would be established during the transition period, with four people from the People's Liberation Army side, one person from General Fu Zuoyi's side, and General Ye Jianying as the director. This committee works under the leadership of the People's Liberation Army Pingjin Front Headquarters. The two sides agreed that the entire army under General Fu Zuoyi that moved out of the city would begin to be reorganized into the People's Liberation Army in about a month. The two sides also agreed that during the transition period, all levels of administrative organs, enterprises, banks, warehouses, postal and telecommunications organs, newspapers, schools, cultural organs, etc. in Peiping City would temporarily maintain the status quo, and must not be damaged, pending disposal. The liberation of Peiping basically ended the war in North China. In northern China, the five provinces of Hebei, Chahar, Shandong, Shanxi, and Suiyuan, and part of Henan, now only have a few places such as Taiyuan, Datong, Guisui, Baotou, Wuyuan, Linhe, Qingdao, Anyang, and Xinxiang that have not yet been liberated. If the Kuomintang reactionary troops in these places are unwilling to follow the example of Peiping, they can only follow the example of Tianjin. Tianjin was liberated in battle in twenty-nine hours, and all the Kuomintang reactionary troops defending the city were eliminated, and all their senior generals were captured. The main elements who refused a peaceful resolution, insisted on resisting to the end, and seriously damaged the lives and property of the people will be tried and sentenced. The liberation of Peiping also points out an example for the liberation of areas south of the Yangtze River and other places. The people of the whole country demand that all reactionary troops led by war criminals who enforce the false orders of "suppressing bandits" and slaughter the Chinese people can accept the terms of the People's Liberation Army like General Fu Zuoyi and his troops. This will prove that they are sincere in achieving genuine peace. General Fu Zuoyi has been actively implementing the false order of "suppressing bandits" in the past two and a half years, and therefore became one of the war criminals. But people believe that since he now accepts the peace terms of the People's Liberation Army and leads his troops out of the city to await reorganization, as long as he continues to move in a direction that is beneficial to the people's cause in the future, he has hope of gaining the people's understanding and being allowed to atone for his crimes.

　　以和平方法结束战争
  　北平宣告完全解放
    国民党军已全部开出城外听候改编
    【新华社陕北三十一日电】世界驰名的文化古都，拥有二百余万人口的北平，本日宣告解放。北平的解放是伟大的中国人民革命运动中最重要的军事发展和政治发展之一。原有国民党反动军队及其军事机构大约二十万人左右据守的北平，乃是执行中国共产党毛泽东主席所宣布的八项和平条件以和平方法结束战争的第一个榜样。这个事实的发生，是人民解放军的十分强大，所向无敌，国民党反动军队中的广大官兵战意消沉、不愿再作毫无出路的抵抗，和北平广大人民群众坚决拥护真正民主和平的结果。北平的国民党军主力现已开至城外指定地点，人民解放军定于本日开始入城接防。北平的人民久已象亲人一样地渴望着人民解放军。在知道了人民解放军即将开入北平之后，北平的工人、学生、市民连忙热闹非凡地筹备着盛大的欢迎仪式，并因国民党军全部出城之一再延期而感觉不耐。人民解放军即将和平地开入北平的消息，使这个古城突然恢复了青春的活力。从一月廿三日起物价顿然下降。街道上从新拥挤着欢天喜地的行人，他们到处探听着解放军入城的确实日期，询问着和传说着解放军和共产党的宣传品的内容。北平的和平谈判曾经进行了一个很长的时间。事实上，从去年十二月人民解放军包围了北平的一天就已经开始接触，但是直至天津解放的前夜，傅作义将军还不愿意接受人民解放军的条件，因而使谈判未获结果。开始时期傅作义还梦想着作绝望的抵抗，随后又梦想着率部逃跑到绥远，或太原或青岛、上海，并与蒋介石信使往还不绝，对于与人民解放军的和平谈判采取敷衍的态度。傅作义直系主力在新保安和张家口被歼，以及国民党整个军事政治形势处于绝望境地，动摇了他的原定计划。一月十四日，中共毛泽东主席宣布八项和平条件，十五日天津迅速解放，十六日人民解放军平津前线司令员林彪将军、政治委员罗荣桓将军向傅作义送出关于北平和平解决办法的公函。这些事变，促使傅作义将军决心接受解放军的提议，谈判才得到进展。双方的谈判决定：为了便于移交和接管，在过渡期间成立七人的临时联合委员会，人民解放军方面四人，傅作义将军方面一人，以叶剑英将军为主任。这个委员会在人民解放军平津前线司令部的领导之下工作。双方协议：开出城外的傅作义将军所部全军在大约一个月后开始改编为人民解放军。双方又协议在过渡期间，北平市内的各级行政机关、企业机关、银行、仓库、邮电机关、报社、学校、文化机关等，一律暂维现状，不得损坏，听候处理。北平的解放基本上结束了华北的战争。中国北部的河北、察哈尔、山东、山西、绥远五省及河南一部，现在只有太原、大同、归绥、包头、五原、临河、青岛、安阳、新乡等少数地方尚未解放，这些地方的国民党反动军队如果不愿意跟随北平的榜样，就只有跟随天津的榜样。天津是在二十九小时内经过战斗解放的，守城的国民党反动军队全部解决，其高级将领全部被俘，其中拒绝和平解决、坚持抵抗到底并严重破坏人民生命财产的首要分子，将被审讯判罪。北平的解放对于长江以南及其他地方的解放也指出了一个榜样。全国人民要求由战争罪犯们统率的所有执行“戡乱剿匪”伪令、屠杀中国人民的一切反动军队，都能象傅作义将军及其所部一样地接受人民解放军的条件，这将证明他们确有诚意实现真正的和平。傅作义将军在过去两年半中是积极执行“戡乱剿匪”伪令的一人，因此成为战争罪犯之一。但是人们相信，既然他现在接受人民解放军的和平条件，率部出城听候改编，那么，只要他今后继续向有利于人民事业的方向走去，他就有希望取得人民的谅解，允许他将功折罪。
