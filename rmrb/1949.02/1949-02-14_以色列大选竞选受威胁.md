　　Israeli Election
  　Campaign Threatened
    [Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 4th] Israel held its first general election since its founding on January 25th. According to a report by Electelegraph, quoting a statement by Mikunis, Secretary-General of the Israeli Republican Party and member of the Provisional Council, "Serious administrative errors during the election preparation period deprived tens of thousands of citizens of their right to vote. In the army, which constitutes a very high percentage of voters, oral campaign propaganda was prohibited. However, the government party arbitrarily used its position in the army for election purposes. This situation particularly applies to the Social Democratic Party, headed by Prime Minister Ben-Gurion and Foreign Minister Shertok. Printed materials of smaller parties did not reach their destination. Oral propaganda among Arabs (who have 33,000 registered voters) was also prohibited, but the vast majority of Arabs are illiterate. New immigrants were also subjected to pressure; they were threatened that if they voted for progressive parties, especially the Communist Party, they would not find work or housing." Under the above restrictions and oppressions, according to an Agence France-Presse report on January 30, the election results showed the Social Democratic Party in the lead, winning 150,000 votes, estimated to hold 44 seats in parliament. The Communist Party won 14,000 votes, estimated to hold 4 seats in parliament.

  　竞选受威胁
    【新华社陕北四日电】以色列国于一月二十五日举行立国以来的首次大眩据电通社引以色列共和党总书记、临时议会议员米库尼斯的谈话称：选举准备期间，行政上的严重错误是剥夺了成千成万公民的选举权。在占有非常高的选民百分比的陆军中，口头的竞选宣传受到禁止。但是，政府党则任意地为着选举的目的利用他们在陆军中的地位，这种情形特别适用于总理本古里安及外长席托克为首的社会民主党。各小党的印刷品到不了目的地。在阿剌伯人（他们有三万三千名登记的选民）当中进行口头宣传也被禁止，但阿剌伯人有绝大多数都是文盲。新的外来移民也受到压力，他们被威胁如果投进步政党、特别是共产党的票，他们将找不到工作或住房。在上述种种限制与压迫下，据法新社一月三十日报导，选举的结果社会民主党占先，该党获十五万票，估计在议会中将有四十四席。共产党获一万四千票，估计在议会中将有四席。
