　　Auspicious Snow Foretells a Good Harvest
  　Snow Falls Successively in Various Liberated Areas
    [Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 6th] According to materials received, the Jin-Sui, Shaanxi-Gansu-Ningxia, and North China liberated areas, as well as Zhengzhou, Kaifeng, and other places, have successively experienced snowfall since winter. The heaviest snowfall was in the southern Shanxi region. This is very helpful for next year's agricultural production, especially for wheat. In southern Shanxi, it snowed continuously for three days starting on the evening of October 22nd last year, and again on the evening of the 30th, with the accumulated snow reaching about 1.2 chi (approximately 40 cm). In various counties of the Jin-Sui liberated area, it snowed three times from mid-December last year to the New Year's Eve, with the snow depth reaching 5 cun (approximately 17 cm). In various parts of the Shaanxi-Gansu-Ningxia border region, it snowed for several days in December last year, with the heaviest snowfall from the 21st to the 24th. The accumulated snow in general areas was more than 6 cun (approximately 20 cm). In the Taihang, Jinzhong, and Jinnan regions of North China, it snowed successively at the end of last year, with the snow depth ranging from 2-3 cun (approximately 7-10 cm) to nearly 1 chi (approximately 33 cm). There is no shortage of snow water. However, although it snowed three times in the Jidong region, only once did it snow as much as 2 cun (approximately 7 cm). The region was already short of rain in the autumn, so the amount of snow is still insufficient. In Zhengzhou, Kaifeng, Xuchang, Yuxian and other places it snowed for three days starting on the 22nd of last month.

　　瑞雪兆丰年
  　各解放区先后下雪
    【新华社陕北六日电】据已收到的材料，晋绥、陕甘宁、华北各解放区和郑州、开封等地，冬季以来曾经先后下雪，其中尤以山西南部地区下得最大。这对来年的农业生产特别是麦子的帮助很大。山西南部地区去年十月二十二日晚起连下三天，三十日晚再下，两次积雪达一尺二寸左右。晋绥解放区各县自去年十二月中旬起至除夕共下雪三次，雪深五寸。陕甘宁边区各地在去年十二月先后下雪几天，以二十一到二十四日下得最大，一般地区积雪在六寸以上。华北的太行区、晋中区和冀南区去年岁暮先后降雪，少者二三寸，多者近尺，雪水已不缺乏，惟冀东区虽下雪三次，但只一次下了二寸，该区秋天就缺雨，所以雪量还嫌不够。郑州、开封、许昌、禹县等地从上月二十二日起下雪三天。
