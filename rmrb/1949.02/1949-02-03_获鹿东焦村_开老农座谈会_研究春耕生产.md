Huolu Dongjiao Village
　　Holds Symposium with Veteran Farmers
　　To Study Spring Farming Production
　　[Report from our newspaper] To understand the problems existing in this year's agricultural production, we convened a symposium with veteran farmers in Dongjiao Village, Second District, Huolu County, on the 27th of last month. We discovered that the farmers there urgently request the issuance of land certificates to confirm land ownership, and hope that the government will strongly assist in spring farming production.

　　Dongjiao Village has 1,044 households, with a population of 3,160, and 12,272 mu of land, averaging 3.08 mu per person. The village is located 15 li west of Wenshui, bordered by mountains on two sides, with only 30 mu of orchard land. It was liberated in 1944. Before liberation, it was in a guerrilla environment, surrounded by enemy strongholds such as Pingshan City, Xijiao, and Sizhuang, all no more than 10 to 20 li away. Dongjiao Village is large, with many people, livestock, and possessions. Every time the enemy set out, they would come here to rob and burn, and the eight years of enemy destruction have left the common people greatly harmed. After liberation, through rent and interest reduction, the re-examination last May, and the equal distribution of land last winter, farmers have generally obtained land equivalent to the village average. The land reform is not yet completed.

　　The symposium was held on the morning of the 27th of last month. Those who attended included poor farmers Wang Lianbao, Qiao Fugui, and Ge Qiannian; new middle farmers He Pingping and He Yimao; middle farmers Wang Buzhi, Tian Jihong, and Wang Maomao; and others, eight people in total. These people are all considered good household managers in the village. At the meeting, everyone talked about the people's current urgent demand for the confirmation of land ownership and the issuance of land certificates. Because the village has not completed the land reform, land ownership has not been determined, and the farmers are very uneasy. Some said: "Generally, people feel that the land they are cultivating belongs to others, and they don't have any solid proof in their hands." Some said: "If land ownership is not specified, we feel uneasy. Who knows who will own it next year after we plant this year?" "Poor people are happy to have land, but no one wants to put manure on the land that is being distributed."

　　Secondly, when talking about the difficulties in production, the main problem is the lack of livestock. On the one hand, it is due to the enemy's looting in the past, and on the other hand, it is due to the high mortality rate. Before the incidents, every household in the village raised livestock, some raising two or three heads. After the enemy occupied the area, they set out every few days to rob things and take livestock. The enemy in Pingshan City once set out to Dongjiao and drove away more than 80 heads. The common people are discouraged from raising livestock. After liberation, with the loans and grain assistance from the democratic government, although it has increased a lot, many livestock have died in recent years. For example, last spring the government provided loans and grain assistance, and bought 20 heads of livestock in a row, but more than 100 heads have died in the past year. As a result, fertilizer has also been greatly reduced. Before the incidents, each mu of land would get 25 to 30 cartloads of manure, some even more. Since the enemy's occupation, it has not been applied. Each mu of land gets 10 to 18 cartloads, and some get none at all. Insufficient fertilizer cannot produce enough grain. In normal years, each mu of land would yield one dan, but now it can only yield five or six dou. Everyone calculated: "If a family of two or three people can raise half a head of livestock and a small pig, and cultivate 8 to 10 mu of land, there will be enough manure."

　　In addition, due to the enemy's several burnings and killings in the past eight years, many houses, farm tools, and all daily necessities were burned. Houses alone were burned more than 500 rooms at a time, so farm tools, etc., are very difficult to obtain. After liberation, with the loans and grain from the democratic government, although many plows, drills, hoes, and rakes have been bought, the lack of wood means that the trees have been cut down and burned by the enemy. Therefore, the most lacking at present are small carts for pushing soil and delivering manure. They said: "It would take four big dou of wheat to make one of these carts now." These are all the current difficulties in production. According to them, the masses in the village have a high level of awareness due to the land they obtained after the land reform, and their enthusiasm for production is very high.

### 获鹿东焦村　开老农座谈会　研究春耕生产

　　获鹿东焦村
  　开老农座谈会
  　研究春耕生产
    【本报讯】为了解今年农业生产上存在些什么问题，我们于上月二十七日在获鹿二区东焦村，召开老农座谈会，发现该地农民迫切要求发土地证确定地权，并希望政府大力帮助春耕生产。
    东焦村一千零四十四户，三千一百六十口人，土地一万二千二百七十二亩，每人平均地三亩零八分。该村西距温水十五里，两面靠山，仅有园地三十亩。一九四四年解放。未解放前，处于游击环境，周围距平山城、西焦、寺庄等敌人据点都不过一、二十里地。东焦村子大，人、牲口、东西较多，敌人每次出发总要到这里来抢烧一阵，八年来敌人的摧残，闹的老百姓元气大伤。解放后，经过减租减息，去年五月复查和去冬平分土地，农民大体上得到相当于全村平均数的土地。结束土改尚未进行。
    座谈会于上月二十七日上午召开，到会的有贫农王联保、乔福贵、葛乾年，新中农何平平、何玉毛，中农王布枝、田吉红、王毛毛等八人。这些人都是村里数出来的好受家。会上大家谈到群众目前的迫切要求是确定地权发土地证，因该村未经结束土改，地权尚未确定，农民们很不安心，有的说：“一般人都觉得养种的地是人家的，不三不四的手里没凭据。”有的说：“地权不规定心里不安，谁知今年种了明年又归谁呢？”“有了地穷人高兴了，可是有粪谁也不往分的地里上。”
    其次，谈到生产中的困难，主要是牲口缺乏。一方面是由于过去敌人的抢掠，一方面是由于死亡率太大。事变前该村家家喂牲口，有的喂两三头，敌人侵占后，三天两头出发抢东西拉牲口，平山城敌人一次出发到东焦就赶走八十多头，老百姓对喂牲口泄气了。解放后在民主政府的贷款贷粮扶助下，虽增加了不少，但这几年牲口死亡很多。如去春政府贷粮扶助，一连买进二十头牲口，可是一年来即死去一百多头。因之，肥料也大大减少，事变前一亩地上廿五六车粪，有的上三十来车，自从敌人侵占后就不沾了，一亩地上个十车八车，还有的不上，粪土不足打不下粮食，常年每亩地打一石，现在只能打五六斗。大家计算了一下：“一家两三口人，如能养半头牲口，一口小猪，养种十亩八亩地，粪土就足够用。”
    此外，该村由于八年来敌人几次烧杀、房子农具及一切日常用具被烧毁很多，仅房子一次就烧了五百多间，因之农具等甚感困难。解放后经民主政府贷粮贷款，虽买的犁耧锄耙等不少，但因木料缺乏，树木都被敌人砍去烧了。所以目前最缺乏的是推土送粪的小车子，他们说：“这会制一辆车子，总得四大斗麦子。”这些都是目前生产上的困难。据他们谈，该村群众，由于土改后获得土地觉悟提高，生产情绪均很高涨。
