　　Xinhua News Agency, Tianjin, 11th -- The Tianjin Branch of Jibei Electric Power Company, based on democratic evaluation by all employees, has implemented rewards for employees who made contributions in protecting company materials before and after liberation, and in resuming work, according to the size of their contributions. The rewards are divided into two types: ordinary rewards and special rewards. Ordinary rewards are further divided into Grade A and Grade B. The evaluation criteria are: (1) returning to work on time; (2) repairing lines; (3) restoring machine rotation; (4) perfect attendance after the Military Control Commission took over; (5) protecting company materials, not taking a single needle or thread from the company. Those who meet three of the above five criteria, without violating the other two, receive Grade A awards: half a bag of flour per person, 500 yuan in Renminbi. If one criterion is violated, they receive Grade B awards: one bag of flour per person, 500 yuan in Renminbi. In addition, if a certain team or group has made special contributions in resuming work or has made special contributions to the company's business, they can receive special rewards. The company's merit evaluation and reward process began on the 24th of last month, with all employees engaging in democratic evaluation. After four days of heated and repeated discussions, the ordinary awards have been finalized and the prizes were distributed on the 27th, while the special awards are still under detailed review. On the eve of the distribution, personnel from the work group dispatched to the company by the Military Control Commission and the truck drivers sacrificed their rest time to transport 4,200 bags of flour overnight, which greatly moved the company's staff. In this evaluation movement, the various sections and shares conducted the process with unusual enthusiasm. Workers and staff actively spoke and implemented self-reporting and public discussion (that is, first, they themselves described their specific performance in resuming work, and then everyone discussed it). In the evaluation, disputes sometimes arose. For example, a Mr. Guan, an administrator in the Personnel Section, went upstairs during the fighting to collect many documents. Some said he should receive a special award, but others said, "This is part of his job, not a special contribution." After a vote, it was determined to be an ordinary award. A worker named Zhang in the Cashier Section, although he himself did not think he had made any contributions, everyone felt that he should receive a special award because he was usually brave in taking responsibility, cherishing public property, guarding the gate during this war, and after liberation, he took the initiative to find the section's staff to go to work. After such evaluation, the enthusiasm of the employees for production has increased. On the 29th of last month (Lunar New Year's Day), almost all of the power generation team's employees came to the factory to participate in the get-together. When the meeting was in full swing, they heard that the coal hauling belt was broken. The repair team immediately went to repair it, and those who were not scheduled to work also went, some without even eating. Another worker named Feng Linquan voluntarily reported to the work group on January 31 that he had buried a purple steel wire ring weighing ninety pounds and other parts underground during the Japanese rule. He had not taken them out during the Kuomintang takeover, because today "the company is our own," and he wanted to dig them out and hand them over to the company for use.

　　天津冀北电力分公司职工
  　民主评奖保护物资功绩
    全体职工生产热情增高
    【新华社天津十一日电】冀北电力公司天津分公司根据全体职工的民主评议，对于解放前后保护公司物资和复工中有功绩的职工，按其功绩大小分别实行奖励。该项奖励分为普通奖励与特别奖励二种。普通奖励又分甲、乙两等。评定标准为：（一）按时复工；（二）抢修线路；（三）恢复机器轮转；（四）军管会接管后考勤无缺；（五）保护公司物资，不拿公司一针一线。凡具备上面五条中的三条，而不违背其他二条的得甲级奖品：每人一袋半面粉，人民币五百元。若违背一条，则得乙等奖品：每人面粉一袋，人民币五百元。此外，若某一班或某一组内在复工中有特殊功绩者或对于公司业务有特殊贡献者，均可得特别奖励。该公司此次评功行奖自上月二十四日即已开始，由全体职工展开民主评议，经四天热烈地反复讨论后，除特别奖尚待详细审查外，普通奖业已评定完竣，并于二十七日发放奖品。发放的前夜，军管会派驻该公司的工作组人员和汽车司机，曾牺牲休息时间连夜运来面粉四千二百袋，使公司职员大为感动。在这次评议运动中，各科、股进行的异常热烈，工友与职员都踊跃发言，实行自报公议（即首先由自己述说自己在复工中的具体表现，然后由大家评议）。评议中，有时也发生了争论，如人事股一姓管的管理员，在战斗中曾上楼收起很多文件，有人说他应受特奖，但也有人说：“这是份内事，不算特功。”经表决后，定为普通奖。出纳股的一个姓张的工友，虽然自己认为没有什么功劳，但是大家却因为他平日勇于负责，爱惜公物，这次战争中，又看守大门，解放后，还自动地去寻找该股职员上班，因之公议他应该得特奖。经过这样评议以后，职工生产热情增高，上月二十九日（旧历元旦），发电团体班的职工，几乎全部都到厂参加同乐会。会开到正热闹时，听说拉煤皮带坏了，修理班马上出动抢修，不该轮到班的也都去了，有的连饭也没吃。另有一个工人叫冯林泉的于一月三十一日自动向工作组报告，他在日本人统治时，曾经将重九十斤的紫钢丝圈及其他零件埋藏地下，在国民党接管期间，他一直也没有拿出来，因为今天“公司是自己的了”，他要挖出来交给公司使用。
