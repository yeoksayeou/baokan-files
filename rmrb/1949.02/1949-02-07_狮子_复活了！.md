The "Lion" is Revived!
    He Jianping

    During the Spring Festival, on the streets of Zhangjiakou filled with laughter and excitement, two "lions," one green and one yellow, were joyfully leaping again. Citizens excitedly told each other: The "lion" of the Ping绥 Railway Bureau's inspection section is alive again!

    The revival of the Ping绥 Railway Bureau's inspection section's "lion" is a sad and inspiring story!

    In the first lunar month of 1946, the citizens of Zhangjiakou, especially the workers, expressed their unprecedented joy to their heart's content. Carts, land boats, Yangko dances, stilts... were all kinds of dazzling and diverse. Employees of the Zhangjiakou inspection section of the Ping绥 Railway Bureau, under the leadership of the 56-year-old foreman Zhou Xuetai, labor union director Lan Huating, and activist Lin Guangquan, organized a "Lion Dance Troupe." Lacking materials, the workers contributed whatever they could. When the two "lions" leaped and rolled on the streets, the citizens were filled with joy. Merchants, the railway bureau, and the government rewarded them with many cigarettes and refreshments, and reporters' camera lenses also captured the "lion's" commemoration. However, in October of that year, the Kuomintang reactionaries' troops occupied Zhangjiakou, and the people of Zhang city were pushed into the abyss of suffering again! The "lion" was then treasured and stored away.

    The "Lion Dance Troupe" of the inspection section reached the ears of Xiong Yifei, the pseudo-district chief of the first district, and he actually thought he had an opportunity to curry favor. During the Spring Festival of 1947, he repeatedly asked the "Lion Dance Troupe" to pay New Year's greetings to their "officials." But neither official letters nor personal calls worked, until the pseudo-labor union threatened and made a private "invitation," did the "Lion Dance Troupe" reluctantly appear. Probably due to careless smoking, the "lion" caught fire in front of the "officials' department." Gasoline had to be used when dyeing the "lion," and four "lion dancers" and one "lion teaser" were burned. Li Fengwu's hair and eyebrows were burned off, and Lan Huating burned half of his face.

    The fire burned people, and people caused trouble. The bandits said that this was an intentional offense to the superiors, and they had to call all the members of the "Lion Dance Troupe." After everyone said many good words, they were spared. Not long after the "lion" was burned, the pseudo-labor union's military affairs officer "Liu the Monk" expelled more than a dozen people including Zhou Lanlin on suspicion of being "communist bandits." The "Lion Dance Troupe's" Ma Yong＠ was detained in the enemy's secret service for eleven months, and he was whipped. His wife ran away in desperation, and there is still no news of her; Zhou Xuetai, who had worked on the Ping绥 Railway for thirty-six years, was forced to sell tofu; technician Lan Huating had no way to make a living and became a pseudo-corvée laborer, and Liu Zhujiu, who was burned with big blisters, is still wandering in Beiping to avoid being drafted... Last year, the people of Zhang city spent the Spring Festival in the terror created by "conscription," and there were very few pedestrians on the streets. Even at this time, they were still secretly looking forward to the revival of the "lion."

    Last December, Zhangjiakou was finally liberated again, and the citizens could breathe freely again. The people of the "Lion Dance Troupe" met their relatives again!

    As the Spring Festival approached, the workers re-established the "Lion Dance Troupe," and they re-elected Zhou Lanlin and two others to lead. The General Labor Union felt that the time was too tight and could prepare some other entertainment; but they had to perform the "lion dance." Originally, it would cost a lot of money to make two "lions." The General Labor Union of the Railway Headquarters subsidized them 1,100 yuan, and the workers raised another 1,700 yuan themselves. Unemployed workers who were very difficult also wanted to contribute money, and after repeated persuasion, they collected some cloth pieces and broken silks. Without small bells, everyone borrowed and looked for them. In order to vent the grievances of the past two years; in order to express the joy of being permanently liberated, they were sometimes so busy that they even forgot to eat. They tied lion heads, split hemp, and dyed them all night long... Some family members also participated in sewing flags. In just five days, two "lions" were successfully made.

    When two "lions" that were bigger and more energetic than before leaped on the streets, when the cheers and applause of the crowd thundered, they had an indescribable pride in their hearts: "We have finally vented our anger, our 'lion' is alive again!"

### “狮子”复活了！

　　“狮子”复活了！
    何建平
    在春节，充满着欢笑与兴奋的张家口的街上，一绿一黄的两个“狮子”，又尽情地跳跃着。市民们互相惊喜地传告着：平绥铁路局检车段的“狮子”又活了！
    平绥铁路局检车段“狮子”的复活，是一段令人悲奋的往事！
    一九四六年阴历正月，张家口市民特别是工人，曾尽情地表露了他们空前的欢快，小车、旱船、秧歌、高跷………真是五花八门应有尽有，平绥铁路局张家口检车段员工，在五十六岁的老领班周雪台、工会主任蓝华亭、积极分子林广全等领导下，组织了“狮子会”。材料不足，工人们你添我凑。当两个“狮子”在街上跳跃和翻滚时，市民们尽情的快乐。商民们、铁路局和政府，慰劳了他们许多香烟茶点，记者们照像机的镜头，也为“狮子”留下了纪念。但是在当年十月间，国民党反动派的军队侵占了张家口，张市人民又被推到痛苦的深渊！“狮子”也就被珍贵的存放起来。
    检车段的“狮子会”，传到伪一区区长熊亦非耳朵里，他竟认为有了拍马屁的机会。在一九四七年春节，他三番四次地叫“狮子会”去给他们“长官”拜年。但来公函、亲自叫都不顶事，直至伪工会的要胁和通过私人“邀请”，“狮子会”才勉强出了场。大概是由于吸烟不慎，“狮子”在“长官部”门前失了火，“狮子”染色时要用汽油，四个耍“狮子”的，和一个“逗狮子”的都被烧了。李凤舞头发眉毛被烧光，蓝华亭烧了半个脸。
    火烧了人，人可惹了祸，匪徒们说，这是有意冒犯长官，非把“狮子会”的人全体叫来不可。后经大家说了许多好话，才幸免于难。“狮子”被烧不久，伪工会军务干事“刘和尚”又以“奸匪”嫌疑的罪名把周蓝林等十几个人开除了。“狮子会”马永＠在敌人特务机关里扣押了十一个月，挨着皮鞭，他老婆急疯跑了，至今未得消息；在平绥路做工三十六年的周雪台，被逼得卖豆腐；技工蓝华亭没法生活，当了伪工役，被烧起了大泡的刘祝九也因躲抓兵，至今流浪北平………。去年春节张市人民是在“征兵”造成的恐怖中度过的，街上绝少行人。就在这个时候，他们仍在暗暗地期待着“狮子”的复活。
    去年十二月张家口终于重获解放，市民们才又自由地呼吸起来，“狮子会”的人们又见了亲人！
    春节近了，工人们又立起了“狮子会”，他们又推了周蓝林三人领导。总工会觉得时间太紧迫，可以准备些别的娱乐；但他们非耍“狮子”不可。本来做两个“狮子”需钱颇多，铁路司令部总工会补助了他们一千一百元，工人们就自己凑了一千七。失业工人十分困难也要出钱，经一再劝阻，才拾了些布件破绸。没有小铃，大家就你借我找。为了出出二年的怨气；为了表现永获解放的愉快，有时忙得连饭也忘了吃。连夜扎狮头劈麻染色………有些家属，也参加缝旗。只五天工夫，两个“狮子”便告成功。
    当两个比以前更大更精神的“狮子”欢跃在街头时，当人群的欢呼和掌声雷动时，他们内心真有难以描述的骄傲：“我们这口气算出了，我们的‘狮子’又活了！”
