Unify Financial and Trade Steps
Prevent Private Merchants from Speculation and Profiteering
Jinzhong Formulates Specific Implementation Measures
[Jinzhong News] In order to regulate finance and stabilize prices, Jinzhong Trading Company and Jinzhong Branch of the People's Bank of China held a joint financial and trade symposium on the 18th of this month to review the current financial and trade management of the market in a serious manner and to discuss closer cooperation in the future. At the meeting, the recent market situation and price trends were first analyzed and studied. Taking Yuci as an example, various prices have risen sharply since late November. The reasons for the increase, in addition to the impact of price fluctuations in neighboring areas, when examining the work in this area, there are many shortcomings. (1) The steps are not coordinated and consistent enough, and they are not good at using the power of the national economy to control and manage the market. For example, in stabilizing prices, although the trading company dumped materials, some branches still lent money to private merchants, enabling them to use public funds for speculation and profiteering, disrupting the market. (2) In the process of purchasing materials, the trading company entrusted some private merchants to purchase on its behalf without inspection, so that some merchants used public funds for speculation. (3) The bank did not adequately check the use of loans, and some blindly issued loans, which promoted the development of speculative capital, so that some unscrupulous merchants used loans to buy and sell indiscriminately and hoard goods for speculation. All of the above shows that our leading role in the market by state-owned enterprises is not clear, our understanding of speculative merchants is insufficient, and it has facilitated private merchants to take the opportunity to make trouble, speculate and profiteer, leading to price increases. For this reason, the following measures have been specifically agreed upon: (1) First, financial and trade funds should support each other, concentrate strength and carry out a strong struggle against speculative and manipulative merchants, and give play to the powerful force of the state-owned economy. (2) In addition to the financial and trade system itself regulating the market, it is also necessary to organize the economic strength of various organs, production and state-owned shops to increase the ability to control the market and prevent speculative vendors from making trouble. (3) Banks must pay attention to inspection when issuing loans to ensure that the use is appropriate. The loan targets should be mainly industrial and handicraft workshops. Secondly, it is the legitimate commerce of local product sales and transportation, as well as essential materials suitable for military and civilian use that can regulate the market. Strictly prevent unscrupulous merchants from using loans to disrupt the market and engage in speculation and profiteering. (4) Finance and trade are like "compatriot brothers" and must be consistent in their steps, unified in their understanding, and give full play to their economic power. Therefore, it is necessary to cooperate with each other, regularly study the financial and price situation, and analyze and guide the management of the market in various places at any time.

　　统一金融贸易步调
    防止私商投机倒把
  　晋中订出具体实施办法
    【晋中讯】为调节金融，稳定物价，晋中贸易分公司与中国人民银行晋中分行，在本月十八日召开金融贸易联席座谈会议，以认真的态度，检讨了当前金融贸易对市场的管理工作，并议定今后密切配合等问题。会议上首先对最近市场情况与物价趋势，做了分析和研究，就榆次来说，从十一月下旬以来，各种物价上涨甚剧。上涨的原因除友邻区物价波动所影响外，从本区工作来检查是有许多缺陷的。（一）步调不够协调和一致，不善于发挥国家经济的力量来控制管理市场。比如在平抑物价当中，贸易公司虽抛出物资，但还有个别支行贷款给私商使他们贷上公家款投机倒把，扰乱了市场。（二）贸易公司在收购物资中，曾委托了一些私商代购而不加检查，使得一些商人利用公家款项进行投机。（三）银行在放款上，对用途掌握检查不够，有的是盲目的发放贷款，助长了投机资本的发展，以致一些奸商利用贷款乱买乱卖，囤积居奇。以上这些，都说明了我们对公营企业在市场上领导作用不明确，对投机奸商认识不足，便利了私商乘机捣乱、投机倒把，以致物价上涨。为此特议定了以下几项办法：（一）首先在金融贸易资金上互相支持，集中力量和投机操纵商人进行强有力的斗争，发挥国营经济的强大力量。（二）除金贸系统本身调剂市场外，更要组织各机关生产公营商店的经济力量，加大对市场控制的能力，防止投机商贩的捣鬼。（三）银行在贷款上必须注意检查，确保用途的适当，贷款对象应当是以工业手工业作坊为主。其次才是土产运销以及适合军需民用能调剂市场必需物资的正当商业。严格防止奸商用贷款捣乱市场金融，进行投机倒把。（四）金融贸易犹如“同胞兄弟”，必须步调一致，认识统一，发挥经济的力量。所以要共同配合，经常对金融物价情况进行研究，随时分析领导各地进行对市场的管理。
