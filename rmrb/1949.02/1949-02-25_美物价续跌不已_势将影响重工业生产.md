　　Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 23rd—Since the drastic drop in American agricultural product prices on the 4th, as of the 17th, the price of corn has fallen 50% compared to the rebound after the sharp drop in February of last year. According to the United States Information Service's "America This Week," corn on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange has fallen from $2.54 per bushel in May of last year to the current price of $1.24. Wheat has fallen from $2.93 to the current price of $2.12. The grain price index has plummeted from 450 points to 282 points. Meat prices also reflect the downward trend. Beef has fallen from a high of $41.60 per hundred pounds at the slaughterhouse to the current price of $31.00, and pork has fallen from a high of $31.05 per hundred pounds to $21.50. Clothing prices are also falling. According to an Associated Press dispatch on the 19th, Edwin Nourse, Chairman of the U.S. President's Council of Economic Advisers, admitted that some signs indicate that the price decline will extend to heavy industry and durable goods industries, and that automobiles and steel will undergo a downward "adjustment" (i.e., price drop) after the fall of this year.
    Simultaneous with the price declines, Ewan Clague, Commissioner of the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics, admitted on the 19th that the number of unemployed in the United States in February had increased by 300,000. Therefore, since January of this year, in just one and a half months, the number of unemployed officially tallied by the U.S. has increased from 2 million in December of last year to 3 million, an increase of 1 million.

    【新华社陕北二十三日电】美国农产品价格自四日剧烈下跌后，迄十七日为止，玉蜀黍（即玉茭）已较去年二月暴跌后所回涨之价格，跌落了百分之五十。据美国新闻处美国一周透露：芝加哥商品交易所之玉蜀黍已由去年五月每蒲式耳二元五角四分跌到现在的一元二角四分。小麦则从二元九角三分，跌到现在的二元一角二分。粮食价格的指数从四五零点猛泻至二八二点。肉类也反映出价格跌落的趋势。牛肉一百磅在屠宰场最高卖到四十一元六角，现在跌到三十一元，猪肉从最高价格每百磅三十一元零五分、跌至二十一元五角。衣着的价格亦在下跌。另据美联社十九日讯：美国总统经济顾问委员会主席诺尔斯承认：若干迹象显示，物价的下跌，将要延及重工业及耐用品工业，汽车与钢铁在今年秋后将作下降的“调整”（按即价格跌落）。
    与物价下跌同时，美国劳工统计局局长克拉克十九日承认：美国二月份的失业人数，业已增加了三十万。因此，自今年一月份起，仅一个半月之内，美官方统计的失业人数，已自去年十二月的二百万人增至三百万人，即增加了一百万人。
