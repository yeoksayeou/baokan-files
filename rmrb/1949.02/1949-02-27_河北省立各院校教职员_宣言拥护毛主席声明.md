Xinhua News Agency, Tianjin, February 22nd: The faculty and staff of Hebei Provincial Institute of Technology, Hebei Provincial Institute of Law and Commerce, Hebei Provincial Women's Normal College, Hebei Provincial Medical College, and Hebei Provincial Fisheries College, including Xian Shushan, Li Jianbo, Liu Ci, Yang Linqing, Xu Zengyuan, Sun Jiwu, Feng Zhian, and 272 others, recently jointly issued a declaration unanimously endorsing Chairman Mao's statement on the current situation issued on January 14th. The text is as follows:

　　With the liberation of Beiping and Tianjin, and soon Nanjing and Shanghai will also be liberated, all of China will soon be liberated, breaking away from the dark hell and seeing the bright sun again.

　　When the People's Liberation Army established glorious achievements in the Northeast, entered Shanhaiguan, and approached Beiping and Tianjin, Chiang Kai-shek, the number one war criminal of the Kuomintang, was forced to issue a communiqué on New Year's Day, putting forward a disguised peace. He hoped to buy time, delay the powerful offensive of the People's Liberation Army, and secretly actively deploy remaining military forces in an attempt to realize a fluke conspiracy. This old trick has long been unwanted, but it only declares his own despicable and sordid methods.

　　Our Chairman Mao, in order to achieve genuine peace, to make the Kuomintang bandit army lay down their weapons and stop resisting stubbornly, and to build a new China as soon as possible, issued a declaration on the current situation on the 14th, putting forward eight just and magnificent proposals. Before the reactionary government is about to enter or has not yet entered a dead end, he pointed out a correct path for it to follow, making it impossible to show the slightest leniency.

　　The Eighth Route Army resisted Japan, fought bloodily for eight years, and completed unprecedented glory in history. The two major cities of Beiping and Tianjin were instead seized by the shameless Kuomintang army as fruits of victory. The traitorous Chiang Kai-shek colluded with American imperialism, pointing the gun northward, using American-style equipment to brutally attack the people, and we were again trapped in darkness. What we saw was nothing but the robber bureaucrats riding on the necks of the people, the anti-people and anti-democratic tyrannical crimes, and we have been oppressed for three years. The liberation of Jinzhou, Changchun, Liaoxi, and Shenyang in the Northeast has made us rejoice upon hearing the news. Then the People's Liberation Army surrounded Tianjin. In our hearts, we fired guns into the city for the heroic warriors. Liberation, liberation, like a torrent rushing south, for lasting peace, there will be no more war from now on. We unanimously support Chairman Mao's eight proposals, carry the revolution through to the end, and completely eliminate the collapsing Chiang bandit army, so that its remnants will no longer have the opportunity to float. The great victory is about to be completed, and when liberation is about to spread throughout the country, we believe that the collection of partial opinions is the opinion of the people of the whole country. We hereby solemnly express our firm support for Chairman Mao's eight proposals to the end.

　　河北省立各院校教职员
  　宣言拥护毛主席声明
    【新华社天津二十二日电】河北省立工学院、河北省立法商学院、河北省立女师学院，河北省立医学院、河北省立水产专科学校教职员羡书剡、李鉴波、刘慈、杨临青、徐增元、孙继武、冯致安等二百七十二人，顷联名发表宣言，一致拥护毛主席一月十四日所发表的对时局声明，原文如下：
    平津解放，南京上海不久解放，全中国不久也就解放，从此脱离了黑暗的地狱，重见了光明的太阳。
    当人民解放军在东北树立了光辉的战绩，入了榆关，逼进平津时，国民党天字号的战犯蒋介石，被迫的在元旦发出了文告，提出了伪装的和平。他希望骗取时间，延缓人民解放军的强大进攻，暗中积极布置残余军事，以图实现侥幸的阴谋。这套旧戏法，早已无人愿意看它，不过又宣示自己手法的卑鄙与龌龊而已。
    我们毛主席为了实现真正的和平，使国民党匪军放下武器，停止顽抗，得已早日建设新中国，于十四日发表对时局宣言，提出八项正义光大的主张。在反动政府将要走入、尚未走入绝路以前，明示出一条正路，使它有所遵循，绝不可能再看丝毫的宽假。
    八路军抗日，八年血战，完成了历史上未有之光荣，平津两大都市反为无耻的国民党军攫取了胜利的果实，卖国的蒋介石又与美国帝国主义勾结，枪口向北，以美国新式的装备装器，残酷地向人民进攻，我们又陷在黑天暗地之中。所见的无非是骑在人民脖子上的强盗官僚，反人民、反民主的豪横罪行，一直又被压迫了三年。东北锦州、长春、辽西、沈阳解放已使我们闻讯色喜了，继而人民解放军包围了天津，我们心里替英勇的武士们向市内打枪，解放，解放，好似洪流奔向南方，为了永久和平，从此以后再也没有战争，我们一致拥护毛主席的八项主张，将革命进行到底，彻底消灭土崩瓦解的蒋匪军，使其残渣余滓，不要再有浮泛的机会。大胜利即将完成，解放不久普遍全国的时候，我们以为部分的意见集合即为全国人民意见，特再对毛主席的八项主张郑重表示拥护到底。
