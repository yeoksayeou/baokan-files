(Editor's Note) The demands of the people of Huixian are entirely reasonable and just. The bandit leaders of Xinxiang will receive their due punishment. The local government should actively lead the people to struggle against the Chiang Kai-shek bandits in Xinxiang, and call on the people to heighten their vigilance and strengthen all kinds of war preparations, and not be paralyzed by the victories on various battlefields.

[Taihang Electric Dispatch] The people of Huixian are accusing the Kuomintang 40th Army bandit leaders Li Zhenqing and Li Chenxi of Xinxiang, demanding that the People's Liberation Army severely punish their chief culprits on the day of Xinxiang's liberation for their monstrous crimes. The Chiang Kai-shek bandits of the 40th Army and local bandits of Xinxiang and Huixian, trapped on the isolated island of Xinxiang, are carrying out desperate struggles under the command of bandit leaders Li Zhenqing and Li Chenxi. From December 12th of last year to January 11th of this year, they launched a cruel and destructive looting "mopping-up" operation against Huixian. From Yanglü to Yuhe, from Huixian city to the Zaihe mountainous area, in a vast area spanning eighty miles in length and fifty miles in width, everywhere was ravaged by the iron hooves of the bandit army. Out of the ten administrative districts in the county, except for the second and ninth districts, which were a hundred miles away from the enemy, the remaining eight districts were generally severely looted by the enemy. No village in the first, fifth, and tenth districts was spared. Some villages in the first and seventh districts were looted more than seven times. A total of 124 administrative villages in the county were looted, accounting for 44 percent of the total administrative villages in the county, with 18,871 households (94,335 people) affected, of which 87 administrative villages with 13,303 households (66,515 people) were the most severely affected. According to a relatively accurate survey, the county lost nearly 140,000 shi of civilian grain, and now there are approximately 4,219 households, with 21,045 people, in the county who have completely run out of food. The extremely vicious bandit army searched and looted all the grain in the homes, courtyards, and fields of the masses. In addition, all furniture, utensils, and farm implements were either looted or destroyed, and firewood and coal were almost completely plundered. In Zhaolei, tenth district, all the doors of the village were pulled away by the enemy. In Sucun, third district, the enemy broke a total of 32 pots. In Baishan'ao, fourth district, a small village of more than 20 households had 19 houses burned down by the enemy, and in Gedao, more than 10 households had 11 houses burned down. Many villages will become uninhabited areas. Even more barbaric than looting, burning, and killing was the enemy's bestial rape of women. In the villages they arrived at, most women could not escape. In Guolei, tenth district, one-third of the women were raped. A mother, daughter, and daughter-in-law in one family were machine-gunned to death for refusing to be raped by the enemy. A sixteen-year-old girl was gang-raped to the point of near death. A new bride in Haozhuang, who was about to be married, was gang-raped by a platoon of enemies. Because they could not avoid the enemy, the women had to crowd into one house for collective resistance, but because they had no weapons, they were brutally beaten by the bandit army. Because of the enemy's looting, slaughter, and ravaging, the masses fled to the mountains or other more distant villages, and were exposed to the elements under trees or in corners of walls by the villages. Many livestock died from freezing and starvation. More than a dozen cattle were frozen to death in Guolei, Yuecun, and Suncun in the tenth district alone. The county is now strengthening and reorganizing county, district, and village war agencies to fight against the enemy, safeguard the interests of the masses, seize the gaps in the war to carry out disaster relief, organize production for self-salvation, and prepare to fight for the final annihilation of the evil Kuomintang bandit army by producing and strengthening our forces. The local people and people's armed forces have also demanded that the government resolutely punish the culprits of this monstrous crime when Xinxiang is liberated.

　　新乡蒋匪疯狂抢掠奸淫
  　辉县人民要求严惩祸首
    边地军民应提高警惕勿因胜利而松懈
    （编者按）辉县人民这种要求是完全合理的，正义的。新乡匪首行将得到它应有的惩罚。当地政府应积极领导人民，向新乡蒋匪进行斗争，并号召人民提高警惕，加强各种备战工作，勿因各战场胜利而麻痹。
    【太行电】辉县人民控诉新乡国民党四十军匪首李振清、李晨熙等要求人民解放军在新乡解放之日严惩其首恶分子，滔天罪行。困守新乡孤岛的蒋匪四十军及新乡、辉县地方土匪，在匪首李振清、李晨熙等指挥下，进行绝望的挣扎。从去年十二月十二号开始到上月十一日，发动了对辉县残酷的毁灭性的抢掠“扫荡”。从杨闾到峪河，从辉县城到宰河山区，长达八十里，宽及五十余里的广阔地区上，到处都遭受了匪军铁蹄的蹂躏。全县十个行政区，除距敌百里的二、九区外，其余八个区普遍遭敌严重抢掠。一区、五区、十区无一村庄幸免。一、七区有的村庄被抢劫七次以上。总计全县被抢劫者达一百廿四个行政村，占全县总行政村百分之四十四，灾民达一万八千八百七十一户（九万四千三百三十五人），其中八十七个行政村有一万三千三百零三户（六万六千五百一十五人），最为严重。据比较准确的调查，全县损失民粮近十四万石，现在全县约有四千二百十九户，两万一千零四十五口人已至全然断炊。穷凶极恶的匪军，将群众家中、院内、野外的粮食搜抢一空。此外，一切家具什物农具尽被抢走或被捣毁，柴草、煤炭几被全数掠去。十区赵垒，全村门板被敌拉走。三区苏村被敌打破的锅共计三十二口。四区白山凹为二十余户小村，被敌纵火烧毁房子十九间，圪道十余户人家，被烧房子十一间，很多村将变成无人区。比抢掠烧杀还要野蛮的，乃是敌人兽性的强奸妇女。所到村庄，妇女大部不能幸免。十区郭垒三分之一的妇女被强奸。一家母女儿媳三口，因拒绝敌人奸污，致遭机枪扫射。十六岁之幼女，被敌轮奸几死。郝庄一家刚要过门的新媳妇，遭到敌人一个排的轮奸。妇女们因躲避不及，只好很多人挤在一个房子以作集体抵抗，但因没有武器，终遭匪军蛮横毒打。群众因为敌人的抢劫、屠杀和蹂躏，纷纷逃往山边或其他较远的村庄，露宿村边树下或墙角。很多牲畜被冻饿而死。仅十区郭垒、岳村、孙村之牛即被冻死十余头。该县现正加强和重整县、区、村战争机构，对敌斗争，维护群众利益，抓紧战争空隙进行灾区安抚、救济；组织生产自救，以生产和壮大力量，准备为最后尽歼万恶国民党匪军而奋斗。该地人民与人民武装并纷纷要求政府在新乡解放之时，坚决惩办这次滔天罪行的祸首。
