Beating the Yellow Wolf
    ——Rewriting the Folk Tale "Beating the Wolf Section"
    Wang Yaping
    If you want to hear a story, look due east,
     From the east comes a young man with a medicine kit.
     If you ask how old the young man is?
     Listen closely, everyone:
     At most, he's twenty,
     At least, he's nineteen.
     A blue cloth towel is tied on his head,
     A purple floral jacket and trousers adorn his body.
     He wears a pair of black shoes,
     And walks very quickly.
　
     If you ask where the young man is going?
     He's going to gather herbs on the hillside.
     Without the storyteller revealing his name and surname,
     Or where he was born and raised?
     He lives in Guide Prefecture, Henan,
     Ten miles from the city, in Fu Family Village.
     His father, surnamed Fu, named Guangsheng,
     Runs a small pharmacy,
     Neighbors from all around come to see him,
     His medicine cures illnesses and is well-regarded.
     He didn't have many sons and daughters,
     Only one son, Fu Hengchang,
     His father ordered him to gather herbs,
     To bring back medicinal herbs to mix with ochre.
     Hengchang left the village and walked forward,
     Walking briskly along the way.
     Walking in the summer is unbearably hot,
     Before long, he came to a row of willows.
     Let me rest and catch my breath,
     Rest a while before climbing the hillside.
　
     Hengchang sat in the shade of the tree,
     From the west, three earth-shattering gunshots rang out.
     If you ask where the gunshots came from?
     A group of people is fighting a yellow wolf,
     Long poles and short clubs,
     Iron rulers, eight-pronged forks, and hook-bladed spears.
     The crowd was blocking the yellow wolf,
     The yellow wolf came to the row of willows.
     The yellow wolf raised its head and looked,
     A young man was resting in the shade.
     The yellow wolf spoke like a human,
     Shaking its head and wagging its tail, pretending to be human.
     The yellow wolf arched its paws forward,
     And called out to the young man to listen:
     "Which state and county do you live in,
     Which river or land wharf do you reside at?"
     The young man quickly returned the courtesy,
     Leaning forward and speaking to the yellow wolf:
     "I live in Guide Prefecture,
     Ten miles from the city, in Fu Family Village.
     My parents gave birth to just me,
     And named me Fu Hengchang.
     My father runs a pharmacy at home,
     And ordered me to gather herbs on the hillside."
　
     The young man finished speaking,
     Immediately alarming the yellow-faced wolf,
     The yellow wolf arched its paws and bowed,
     And again called out to the young man, Fu Hengchang:
     "Judging by your face, you are truly honest,
     And possess a courageous and kind heart,
     People are chasing me from behind,
     I hope you'll save me, little yellow wolf!
     The world says wolves are ruthless,
     But my heart is stronger than a human's,
     If you save me this time,
     I'll help you gather herbs on the hillside."
     The young man listened to the wolf's words,
     And again called out to the yellow wolf to listen to me:
     "My grandmother taught me before,
     That all living things should not be harmed,
     I am willing to save you,
     But I don't know which mountain you live on?"
     The yellow wolf said: "My home is in the western mountains,
     Living in the disordered hills of the west,
     My old father is named Wolf Wolf Er禿 [balding],
     My mother's maiden name is Wolf, she is paired with Wolf.
     They didn't have many sons and daughters,
     Only three wolves born to one mother:
     The eldest brother is named Wolf Desheng,
     The second brother is named Shengdelang,
     I'm the youngest, number three,
     My name is Three Yellow Wolf.
     The eldest brother went down the mountain half a month ago,
     The second brother went down the mountain ten days ago,
     My old mother misses her sons who haven't returned,
     And sent me, the youngest, to find my brothers.
     I went down the high mountains and rushed to the main road,
     Walking past the village,
     Right on the roadside in the village,
     I encountered children playing in the mud,
     Seeing the children, I felt hungry,
     And ate the children for lunch,
     I thought eating the children was nothing.
     Unexpectedly, the villagers are chasing the yellow wolf!"
     The young man hesitated, undecided,
     Thinking back and forth, he had no idea.
     He thought the yellow wolf was young and pitiful,
     It's unreasonable not to save a life he encounters,
     He should still save it,
     Having made up his mind, he spoke:
     "I'm willing to save you today,
     But where will you hide?"
     The yellow wolf said: "If you save me today,
     I'll hide in your medicine kit."
     The young man said: "The medicine kit is small and thin,
     I'm afraid it will be difficult to fit you inside."
     The yellow wolf said: "I'll shrink my body and hide for a while,
     And come out of the kit once the people have passed."
     The young man said: "Alright, alright,
     You hide in the kit."
     He quickly opened the lid of the kit,
     And the yellow wolf shrunk its waist and entered the medicine kit.
　
     The young man sat on the medicine kit,
     Pretending to rest in the shade.
     Dust billowed from the east,
     A group of people arrived at the row of trees.
     The hunters spoke up and called out,
     Calling out for the young man to listen carefully:
     "You're resting under the tree,
     Have you seen a yellow-faced wolf?"
     The young man hurriedly stood up,
     And said to the hunting comrades:
     "I live on the plains,
     And have never seen a wolf since I was little.
     I only saw a yellow dog running from the east,
     With its tail between its legs, heading northwest."
     The crowd all said: "That's it,
     That's exactly the wild beast, the yellow-faced wolf."
     The group of people went northwest,
     Going northwest to chase the yellow wolf.
　
     The hunters left triumphantly,
     Let's talk about the young man, Fu Hengchang,
     He hurriedly opened the lid of the medicine kit,
     And the yellow wolf straightened its waist and came out of the kit.
     The yellow wolf stood outside the medicine kit,
     Examining the young man, Fu Hengchang,
     He was red and plump,
     His flesh was fat and tender like a sheep,
     I, the yellow wolf, haven't eaten my fill in three days,
     And now I feel even more hungry,
     The yellow wolf bared its teeth and brandished its claws,
     And called out to the young man, Fu Hengchang:
     "I've been hungry for three days,
     And I smell the fragrance of your human flesh,
     Please give me a full meal,
     I won't forget your kindness!"
　
     The young man was afraid after hearing this,
     His whole body trembled and his face turned yellow,
     Forcing himself to speak with courage,
     He spoke again to the yellow-faced wolf:
     "I sincerely pitied you,
     It is unreasonable not to save a life I encounter,
     I saved your life today,
     Why do you want to hurt me instead?"
     The yellow wolf said: "Don't talk that nonsense,
     'Reason' is not as good as the fragrance of human flesh,
     Wild beasts don't eat meat for three days,
     And their mouths feel dry and itchy."
     The yellow wolf's mouth was clever, but its heart was fierce,
     With a lunge, it pounced on Hengchang,
     Knocking the young man to the ground,
     Ripping and tearing his clothes,
     It tore apart two and a half of his three garments,
     Revealing a close-fitting vest protecting his chest,
     Just as the young man's life was in danger,
     From the northwest, three earth-shattering gunshots rang out.
　
     If you ask where the gunshots came from?
     It turned out to be the hunters returning home.
     The yellow wolf was afraid upon hearing this,
     And quickly helped Fu Hengchang up,
     Helping him put on his clothes and buttoning them up,
     With a smiling face, it answered in a low voice:
     "I was just joking with you,
     I would never hurt you!
     You saved me twice,
     I can't forget the kindness of saving my life,
     Even birds and beasts know feelings,
     Let alone a wolf with a heart!"
     The yellow wolf had just finished speaking its clever words,
     Angering the young man, Fu Hengchang,
     He was angry and thinking at the same time,
     And came up with a wonderful plan.
     He quickly pretended to say: "Alright, alright,
     I'll save you a second time, little yellow wolf,
     Quickly hide in the kit,
     The hunters are getting close."
     The young man opened the lid of the kit,
     And the yellow wolf shrunk its waist and jumped into the kit.
　
     The yellow wolf jumped into the medicine kit,
     Alarming the young man, Fu Hengchang,
     He quickly closed the lid of the kit,
     And locked it with a three-ringed lock.
     The young man stood under the tree,
     And shouted loudly facing northwest:
     "Hunters, come quickly!
     There's a yellow-faced wolf hiding here!"
     The yellow wolf heard the shouting outside,
     And went crazy inside,
     Gnawing and chewing on the wooden planks,
     Howling and roaring wildly.
     The hunters didn't delay,
     And came to the row of willows,
     With long poles and short clubs,
     Iron rulers, eight-pronged forks, and hook-bladed spears.
     They shouted for the young man to get out of the way,
     Lest the wild beast hurt you!
     They used a hook-bladed spear to open the lid of the kit,
     And stabbed the yellow-faced wolf with a pointed spear,
     Beating and stabbing,
     In an instant, they beat the wild yellow wolf to death.
　
     The hunters spoke up and called out:
     "Brother, come home with us,
     Come to our house to eat wolf meat,
     Taste how fragrant wolf meat is!
     Eat your fill of boiled wolf meat,
     And use the leftover wolf skin to make clothes."
     The young man was happy upon hearing this,
     And again called out to the hunting comrades to listen to me:
     "You were chasing it just now,
     And I hid the wild beast in the kit,
     Hoping to save its life,
     But it came out and wanted to hurt me instead,
     If it weren't for you turning back,
     My life would have been lost.
     The wild beast's heart is truly vicious,
     I was almost tricked and lost my life.
     This time, the wild beast was beaten to death,
     Thank you all for your efforts,
     I originally wanted to eat wolf meat with you,
     But I'm afraid of delaying my herb gathering on the hillside."
     The crowd said: "You were born on the plains and are young,
     You don't understand the bad hearts of wild beasts;
     We were born on the hillsides,
     And have been bitten by jackals, wolves and poisonous snakes.
     After that, we joined forces to fight wild beasts,
     And have been stepping up our defenses day and night,
     We beat one when we see one,
     We beat a pair when we see a pair,
     The wild beasts on the mountain are gradually decreasing,
     But there are still poisonous snakes and yellow wolves,
     Don't look down on the yellow wolf's small body,
     It has a bad heart,
     Don't be fooled by its sometimes pretending to be pitiful,
     It will turn around and hurt people.
     Let's organize our manpower well,
     With many clubs and strong firearms,
     No matter if it's a gray rat wolf, red-eyed wolf,
     Yellow-faced wolf, mountain front wolf, mountain
     Back wolf, poisonous snakes and wild beasts crawling in the grass and hiding in the caves, harming
     The wild jackals and wolves that endanger the people,
     Let's resolutely eliminate them all,
     And not leave any harm to the people.
     At that time, we will be free from fear and harm,
     And men, women, old and young will be safe and healthy!"
     The young man listened to the speech,
     And his ideological awareness was illuminated.
     The hunters returned home,
     And Fu Hengchang carried his medicine kit up the hillside.
     This is a section on beating the wolf,
     Hoping comrades carefully consider the meaning in the book.

　　打黄狼
    ——改写民间传说“打狼段”
    王亚平
    想听书请朝正东望，
     从正东来了个青年背药箱
     要问青年有多大？
     列位不知听端详：
     观大不过二十岁，
     尽小也在十九上。
     蓝布手巾头上扎，
     紫花裤褂穿身上，
     脚穿一双黑鞋子，
     走起路来很快当。
　
     要问青年哪里去？
     他去采药上山岗。
     未从说书表名姓，
     本生土长住哪方？
     家住河南归德府，
     离城十里傅家庄，
     他爹姓傅名光生，
     开设一家小药房，
     邻里四乡来看病，
     药到病除有名望。
     没生几多儿和女，
     所生一子傅恒昌，
     他爹命他去采药，
     采回药草配丹黄。
     恒昌出村往前走，
     一路走来脚步忙，
     夏天行路热难当，
     不远来到柳树行，
     歇歇吧我喘喘吧，
     歇息歇息爬山岗。
　
     恒昌坐在树荫下，
     打正西惊天动地三声枪。
     要问那里枪声响？
     一哨人马打黄狼，
     长的杆子短的棍，
     铁尺八杈钩镰枪。
     众人正把黄狼断，
     黄狼来到柳树行。
     黄狼抬起头来看，
     一位青年歇荫凉。
     黄狼学着人说话，
     摇头摆尾装人腔。
     黄狼回前拱拱爪，
     叫声青年听衷肠：
     “你家住哪州并哪县，
     河陆码头住何方”？
     青年连忙还个礼，
     欠身开言叫黄狼：
     “我家住在归德府，
     离城十里傅家庄，
     父母生我一孤丁，
     起名就叫傅恒昌，
     爹爹在家开药店，
     命我采药上山岗”。
　
     青年那里讲一遍，
     马上惊动黄脸狼，
     黄狼拱爪把揖作，
     再叫青年傅恒昌：
     “看你面相真厚道，
     见义勇为好心肠，
     后边有人把我赶，
     望你救我小黄狼！
     世人都说狼心狠，
     我的心眼比人强，
     你若今番把我救，
     我帮你采药到山岗”。
     青年听罢狼的话，
     再叫黄狼听我讲：
     “从前祖母教训我，
     凡是生物不可伤，
     我是有心救下你，
     不知你住哪山上”？
     黄狼说：“俺家就在西山住，
     住到西山乱山岗，
     老爹爹姓狼狼二秃，
     母亲娘姓狼它配狼。
     未生多儿共多女，
     一母所生三个狼：
     大哥名叫狼得胜，
     二哥名叫胜得狼，
     数我小三年经小，
     我的名字三黄狼。
     大哥下山半月整，
     二哥下山十天上，
     老母亲想儿儿不回，
     差我小三找兄长。
     下尽高川奔大道，
     行走路过庄头上，
     就在庄头大路边，
     遇着小孩玩泥浆，
     见了小孩心里饿，
     吃了娃娃当顿汤，
     我只说吃了小孩没有事。
     不料想村庄人马打黄狼”！
     青年犹疑心不定，
     想来想去没主张，
     他想着黄狼年小实可怜，
     见生不救理不当，
     还是把它救下吧，
     思想已好就开腔：
     “我有心今天救下你，
     你到哪里去躲藏”？
     黄狼说：“今天你来救下我，
     我就藏进你药箱”。
     青年说：“药箱小来板
     又薄，
     怕难把你往里装”。
     黄狼说：“缩缩身子藏一会，
     人马过去就出箱”。
     青年就说：“好好好，
     你在箱里藏一藏”。
     急忙打开箱子盖，
     黄狼把腰一缩进药箱。
　
     青年坐在箱子上，
     假装休息乘荫凉。
     尘土滚滚东边起，
     一哨人马到树行。
     打生的人等开言叫，
     叫声青年听端详：
     “你在树下歇息坐，
     可曾见到一个黄脸狼”？
     青年慌忙站起身，
     打生的哥们听我讲：
     “俺家住在平川地，
     从小没有见过狼，
     俺只见东边跑来一黄狗，
     夹着尾巴西北＠”。
     众人都说：“那就是，
     那正是野兽黄脸狼”。
     一哨人马西北去，
     一往西北赶黄狼。
　
     打生的人等扬长走，
     再说青年傅恒昌，
     他急忙打开箱子盖，
     这黄狼把腰一耸出药箱。
     黄狼站在药箱外，
     打量青年傅恒昌，
     他又红来他又胖，
     血肉肥美象绵羊，
     我黄狼三天没吃饱，
     这会又觉饿的慌，
     黄狼张牙又舞爪，
     叫声青年傅恒昌：
     “我已三天受饥饿，
     嗅着你的人肉香，
     请你管我一顿饱，
     忘不了你的好心肠”！
　
     青年听罢害了怕，
     混身打颤面皮黄，
     强打着精神说句话，
     出言再叫黄脸狼：
     “我本出心可怜你，
     见生不救理不当，
     今天救你一活命，
     为啥反要把我伤”？
     黄狼说：“别讲那些瞎‘道理’，
     ‘道理’不抵人肉香，
     野兽三天不吃肉，
     口里发干心痒痒”。
     黄狼嘴巧心发狠，
     将身一纵扑恒昌，
     把青年扑倒流平地，
     撕拉撕拉扯衣裳，
     三件子衣裳撕开两件子半，
     闪个贴身子坎肩护胸膛，
     眼看青年命难保，
     打西北惊天动地三声枪。
　
     要问枪声何处起？
     原来是打生的人等回家乡。
     黄狼一听害了怕，
     赶紧搀起傅恒昌，
     给他穿衣结扭扣，
     满脸陪笑答下腔：
     “刚才给你开玩笑，
     说啥不能把你伤！
     你要二番救下我，
     救命的恩人不能忘，
     禽兽之类知情意，
     何况我这有心狼”！
     黄狼的巧语刚说罢，
     气煞了青年傅恒昌，
     一边气来一边想，
     想起妙计有主张。
     连忙假说：“好好好，
     二番救你小黄狼，
     赶快藏在箱子内，
     打生的人等到近旁”。
     青年打开箱子盖，
     黄狼把腰一缩钻进箱。
　
     黄狼钻到药箱里，
     惊动青年傅恒昌，
     急忙盖上箱子盖，
     三簧小锁他锁上。
     青年站到树底下，
     面朝西北喊的慌：
     “打生的哥们快来吧！
     这里藏着个黄脸狼”。
     黄狼听到外面喊，
     它在里面就疯狂，
     唏嚷喀＠咬木板，
     呜呜恶叫乱冲闯。
     打生的人等不怠慢，
     这才来到柳树行，
     长的竿子短的棍，
     铁尺八枚钩镰枪。
     喊声青年快躲开，
     莫叫野兽把你伤！
     弯钩枪走上打开箱子盖，
     尖头枪上前扎住黄脸狼，
     打的打来刺的刺，
     刹时间打死野黄狼。
　
     打生的人等开言叫：
     “老弟跟俺回家乡，
     到俺家去吃狼肉，
     尝一尝狼肉香不香？
     煮好狼肉吃个饱，
     剩下狼皮做衣裳。”
     青年听罢心欢畅，
     再叫打生的哥们听我讲：
     “刚才你们来追赶，
     我把野兽藏进箱，
     妄想救它一活命，
     它出来反要把我伤，
     要不是你们回家转，
     我的性命要灭亡。
     野兽心肝真恶狠，
     差点叫我受骗上当把命丧。
     这一回野兽被打死，
     感谢大家出力量，
     我本有心跟你们吃狼肉，
     又怕耽误采药上山岗”。
     众人说“你生在平地年纪轻
     不懂野兽坏心肠；
     我们生在山坡地，
     曾被豺狼毒蛇来咬伤。
     那以后我们合力打野兽，
     日夜加紧做提防，
     见一个来打一个，
     见一双来打一双，
     山上野兽渐稀少，
     还有那毒蛇和黄狼，
     别看黄狼身个少，
     肚里有着坏心肠，
     别看它有时假装可怜相，
     反过手来把人伤。
     咱们把人手组织好，
     棍棒多来枪火强，
     不管它灰鼠狼、红眼狼
     、黄脸狼、山前狼、山
     后狼、爬在草里藏在洞
     里的毒蛇、野兽、坑害
     人民的野豺狼，
     咱们坚决一齐消灭净，
     不给人民留祸殃。
     到那时不受惊来不受害，
     男女老幼得安康！
     青年听罢一场话，
     思想觉悟亮胸膛。
     打生的人们回家转，
     傅恒昌背起药箱上山岗。
     这本是打狼一个段，
     盼同志把书中意思仔细
     想一想。
