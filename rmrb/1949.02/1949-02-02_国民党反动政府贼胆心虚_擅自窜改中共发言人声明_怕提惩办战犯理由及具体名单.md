Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, January 31st: The Nanjing Central News Agency, on January 29th, forwarded the statement of the CCP spokesperson of January 28th, and in addition to deleting or altering many important words and phrases, also intentionally deleted many paragraphs containing extremely important meanings. Regarding the issue of Japanese war criminal Neiji Okamura, the Central News Agency deleted the following paragraph: "The Chinese people sacrificed countless lives and property in the eight-year War of Resistance against Japan, and were fortunate to win victory. Having captured this war criminal, we cannot allow the Nanjing Kuomintang reactionary government to arbitrarily declare him innocent. The people of the whole country, all democratic parties, people's organizations, and patriotic people within the Nanjing Kuomintang reactionary government system must immediately rise up to oppose this criminal act of the Nanjing reactionary government in selling out national interests and colluding with Japanese fascist warlords." The following paragraph was also deleted by the Central News Agency: "This matter is closely related to your current request to negotiate with us. We believe that your current actions are attempts to use false peace negotiations to cover up your reorganization of war preparations, including a conspiracy to collude with Japanese reactionaries to come to China and slaughter the Chinese people along with you. Your release of Neiji Okamura is for this purpose." Regarding the issue of civil war criminals, the Central News Agency deleted and altered the following paragraph: "You convened a bogus National Assembly, formulated a bogus constitution, elected a bogus president, and issued a bogus order for 'mobilizing to quell the rebellion,' all with such tension, enthusiasm, diligence, and urgency, and without listening to anyone's advice. At that time, the official or pro-government so-called councils, chambers of commerce, trade unions, farmers' associations, women's groups, and literary groups in Shanghai, Nanjing, and other large cities all chimed in, 'supporting mobilization to quell the rebellion and eliminate the communist bandits,' with such tension, enthusiasm, diligence, and urgency, and without listening to anyone's advice. Now, two and a half years have passed, and the number of people you have massacred is no less than several million, the number of villages you have burned, the number of women you have raped, the amount of property you have plundered, and the amount of living and non-living force destroyed by your air force is countless. You have committed heinous crimes, and this debt must be settled. I hear that some of you are opposed to liquidation and struggle. But this time, the liquidation and struggle are justified and must be thoroughly cleared, calculated, struggled, and contested. You have been defeated. You have angered the people. The people have all risen up and are fighting you desperately. The people do not like you, the people condemn you, the people have risen up, you are isolated, and therefore you have been defeated." The Central News Agency deleted and altered the above paragraph into the following sentences: "Now, two and a half years have passed, and you have committed heinous crimes, and this debt must be settled. Although you are opposed to liquidation and struggle, this liquidation and struggle are justified and must be thoroughly cleared, calculated, struggled, and contested." In the final paragraph discussing the issue of civil war criminals, the original text was: "In addition to arresting Japanese war criminal Neiji Okamura, you must immediately arrest a batch of civil war criminals, first arresting the forty-three war criminals mentioned in the statement by a certain authoritative figure of the CCP on December 25th of last year who are in Nanjing, Shanghai, Fenghua, and Taiwan. The most important among them are Chiang Kai-shek, Soong Tzu-wen, Chen Cheng, He Yingqin, Gu Zhutong, Chen Lifu, Chen Guofu, Zhu Jiahua, Wang Shijie, Wu Guozhen, Dai Chuanxian, Tang Enbo, Zhou Zhirou, Wang Shuming, and Gui Yongqing. Especially important is Chiang Kai-shek, who has now fled to Fenghua and is very likely to flee abroad, seeking refuge with American or British imperialism. Therefore, you must arrest this criminal and prevent him from escaping." The Central News Agency deleted and altered this paragraph into the following sentences: "In addition to arresting Japanese war criminal Neiji Okamura, you must continue to arrest a batch of civil war criminals, first arresting the forty-three war criminals mentioned in the statement by a certain authoritative figure of the CCP on December 25th of last year. You must arrest them quickly and prevent them from escaping." Readers and listeners, please note: What did the Central News Agency arbitrarily delete and alter? It was the reasons for why Japanese war criminals must be arrested, the reasons for why civil war criminals must be liquidated, the list of important war criminals directly under the Chiang Kai-shek clique that the Nanjing government was required to arrest first, and especially the war criminal ringleader, Chiang Kai-shek. The Nanjing Kuomintang reactionary government agreed to take the CCP's eight articles as the basis for negotiations, and the first of the eight articles was to punish war criminals, but they were unwilling for us to mention the reasons for punishing war criminals and the specific list of war criminals. In addition, the Central News Agency also completely deleted the third point of the CCP spokesperson's statement. The entire text of this point was only seventeen characters, namely "(3) The above two items require a response from the Nanjing reactionary government." What was the intention of deleting these seventeen characters? Could it be because the text was too long?

　　国民党反动政府贼胆心虚
  　擅自窜改中共发言人声明
    怕提惩办战犯理由及具体名单
    【新华社陕北三十一日电】南京中央社一月二十九日转发一月二十八日中共发言人声明，除删掉或窜改许多重要的字句之外，还有意地删掉许多包含着极重要意义的段落。关于日本战犯冈村宁次问题，中央社删掉了下面一段：“中国人民在八年抗日战争中牺牲无数生命财产，幸而战胜，获此战犯，断不能容许南京国民党反动政府擅自宣判无罪。全国人民，一切民主党派，人民团体以及南京国民党反动政府系统中的爱国人士，必须立即起来反对南京反动政府方面此种出卖民族利益、勾结日本法西斯军阀的犯罪行为。”下面的一段也被中央社删掉了：“此事与你们现在要求和我们进行谈判一事，有密切关系。我们认为你们现在的种种作为，是在企图以虚伪的和平谈判掩护你们重整战备，其中包括勾结日本反动派来华和你们一道屠杀中国人民一项阴谋在内，你们释放冈村宁次，就是为了这个目的。”关于内战罪犯问题，中央社删掉并窜改了下面一段：“你们召开伪国大，制定伪宪法，选举伪总统，发布‘动员战乱’的伪令，又是那样的紧张，热烈，殷勤，迫切，又是什么人的劝告也不听。那时，上海、南京及其他大都市的官办的或御用的所谓参议会，商会，工会，农会，妇女团体、文人团体，一齐起哄，‘拥护动员戡乱，消灭共匪’，又是那样的紧张，热烈，殷勤，迫切，又是什么人的劝告也不听。如今，过了两年半，被你们屠杀的人民何止数百万，被你们焚毁的村庄，奸淫的妇女，掠夺的财物，被你们的空军炸毁的有生无生力量，是数不清的，你们犯了滔天大罪，这笔帐必得算一算。听说你们很有些反对清算斗争。但是这一次清算斗争是事出有因的，必得清一清，算一算，斗一斗，争一争。你们是打败了。你们激怒了人民。人民一齐起来和你们拚命。人民不欢喜你们，人民斥责你们，人民起来了，你们孤立了，因此你们打败了。”上面这一段，中央社删窜成为这样几句：“如今，过了两年半，你们犯了滔天大罪，这笔帐必得算一算。虽说你们反对清算斗争，但是这一项清算斗争是事出有因的，必须清一清，算一算，斗一斗，争一争。”在谈内战罪犯问题的末尾一段中，原文是：“除了逮捕日本战争罪犯冈村宁次以外，你们必须立即动手逮捕一批内战罪犯，首先逮捕去年十二月二十五日中共某权威人士声明中所提四十三个战犯之在南京、上海、奉化、台湾者。其中最重要的是蒋介石，宋子文，陈诚，何应钦，顾祝同，陈立夫，陈果夫，朱家骅，王世杰，吴国桢，戴传贤，汤恩伯，周至柔，王叔铭，桂永清等人。特别重要的是蒋介石，该犯现已逃至奉化，很有可能逃往外国，托庇于美国或英国帝国主义。因此，你们务必逮捕该犯，毋令逃逸。”中央社将这一段删窜成为下列几句：“除了逮捕日本战犯冈村宁次以外，你们必须继续动手逮捕一批内战罪犯，首先逮捕去年十二月二十五日中共某权威人士声明中所提四十三个战犯。你们务必迅速逮捕，勿使逃逸。”读者们和听者们注意：中央社擅自删掉和窜改的是些什么呢？是关于必须逮捕日本战犯的理由，是关于必须清算内战罪犯的理由，是关于要求南京政府首先逮捕蒋系直属各重要战犯的名单，特别是蒋介石这个战犯魁首。南京国民党反动政府是同意以中共的八条为谈判基础的，八条的第一条是惩办战犯，但是他们却不愿意我们提起所以要惩办战犯的理由和战犯的具体名单。此外，中央社还整个地删掉了中共发言人声明的第三点，这一点的全文总共只有十七个字，即“（三）以上二项，要求南京反动政府给予答复。”删掉这十七个字的用意何在呢？难道是为了文字太长吗？
