　　【Jinan Telegram】Since the autumn plowing season, the Fourth District of Yuanchao has added 549 livestock (including 357 capable of agricultural labor and 192 young animals), as well as many pieces of equipment such as drills, hoes, and mattocks. They have repaired 14 large carts, 36 small carts, 10 plows, and 2 harrows. They have added 521 pigs, 84 pig pens, and 41 manure pits, and have already composted more than 20,000 large cartloads of winter fertilizer. In addition, they have added 2 oil mills, 1 flour mill, and 11 cotton gins. The sideline industry alone has earned more than 46.4 million Jichaobi, and they have completed the task of plowing 17,635 mu of autumn stubble once. The peasants in the villages said excitedly: "With carts, plows, and cattle, there is no need to worry about developing production." They have full confidence in increasing agricultural production this year. The reasons for achieving the above results are: First, the cadres in the district went deep among the masses, actively promoted production policies, and combined them with solving various specific difficulties. For example, in Chenxian Village, they discovered unfairness in the distribution of livestock labor, and immediately mobilized the masses to revise the wartime burden-sharing method. The village increased its purchase of 19 cattle. In Qianbao Village, the random borrowing of farm tools without proper care resulted in a general lack of farm tools. The district committee immediately led the members of the farmers' association to discuss and correct the situation, and formulated a new rule: "Everything has its owner, borrowing requires the consent of the owner, and whoever damages it is responsible for repairing it." It was also decided that the farmers' association would supervise the implementation. After the regulations were implemented, two large carts were added, and all the broken plows, harrows, hoes, etc. were repaired. In addition, the main reason was that the incorrectly determined class status of some households was corrected, which removed the ideological burden on the peasants, established the idea of ​​the masses becoming prosperous, and improved the enthusiasm for production. After Lu Zhenguo of Qianshalu was reclassified as a middle peasant, he said: "From now on, whoever gets rich is their own business, why shouldn't I work hard to produce!" After compensating Zhou Caiqin, a middle peasant who had been wrongly struggled against, for his property, he deeply realized that the Communist Party's policy was really for the development of production. Therefore, he was planning all day long how to accumulate more fertilizer in the future and repair all the broken plows, hoes, harrows, and drills to strive for prosperity. The district committee then used Zhou Caiqin as a typical example to universally inspire the peasants to formulate production and prosperity plans.

　　元朝四区加紧准备大生产
  　增添大批农具牲口
    【冀南电】元朝四区从秋耕开始至今，增添牲口五百四十九头（内能参加农业劳动的三百五十七头，幼畜一百九十二头），及耧锄镢头等多件。修好大车十四辆，小车三十六辆，犁十张，耙两盘。添猪五百二十一口，猪圈八十四个，粪坑四十一个，已沤出冬肥二万余大车，另添油坊二座、粉坊一座、弹轧花坊十一座，仅副业一项，即赚冀钞四千六百四十余万元，并完成一万七千六百三十五亩秋茬翻土一遍的任务。各村农民兴奋的说：“有车有犁又有牛，开展生产不用愁。”对今年农业增产已具有充分信心。获得以上成绩的原因：首先是该区干部深入群众，主动宣传生产政策，结合解决各种具体困难。如在陈仙村发现牲口出差不公，当即发动群众改订了战勤负担办法，该村增买牛十九头。在前鲍庄由于乱借农具不添光坏的结果，致该村农具普遍缺乏，区委会马上领导农会会员讨论纠正办法，订出“物各有主，借则经本人同意，谁使坏谁负责修好”的新规矩，并议定由农会监督执行。规定后即增加了大车两辆，已坏的犁、耙、锄等全部修好。此外，主要的原因则是改正了某些户的错订成份，解除了农民的思想包袱，树立群众发家思想，生产情绪提高。前沙路吕振国改订为中农后说：“以后谁过富了是谁的，我为啥不好好生产呢！”补偿了错斗中农周才琴的财物后，他深深体会到共产党的政策真是为了发展生产，因此他成天盘算着今后如何多积肥，并修好一切坏了的犁锄耙耧，争取发家致富。该区区委会遂以周才琴为典型例子，普遍启发农民订立生产发家计划。
