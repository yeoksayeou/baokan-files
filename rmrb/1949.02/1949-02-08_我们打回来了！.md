　　We Fought Our Way Back!
    Collective work by Guo Feng, Xu Kong, and Ning Gan, written by Guo Feng

    Together with our brothers in the Northeast Army, on the evening of December 23, 1948, we marched towards Zhangjiakou, braving the driving snow. As we walked along Yian Street, where red flags were fluttering, we deliberately made our footsteps heavy, letting them crunch on the road that we had personally paved two years ago. This sound seemed to be telling the people in the streets: we have returned to Zhangjiakou.

    The people of Zhangjiakou have not forgotten the People's Liberation Army. Ignoring the gunshots ringing outside Dajingmen, they ran into the streets to welcome us. When the Northeast People's Liberation Army's propaganda trucks arrived, people swarmed around the photos of Chairman Mao and Commander-in-Chief Zhu, cheering loudly. Many ordinary people came to look for their old friends. Railway worker Xiong Jianfeng was inquiring about his fellow worker, Comrade Qiu Wenquan. The wife of water carrier Zhang Peixin, holding the three-year-old child that a female teacher had left in her care two years ago, ran into the street, asking everyone she met, "Has Comrade Liu returned?" On this day, such dialogues could be heard everywhere: "Comrades, you have finally come back. If you had come a few days later, we would not have seen you." "We are back, folks. How much suffering have you endured these past two years!"

    If there was someone here who had not been to Zhangjiakou two years ago, who had not participated in the construction of the new Zhangjiakou, for example, if he had not wielded a pickaxe, sweating alongside the people of Zhangjiakou to build the dams of the Xisha River, then he would find it difficult to understand what kind of mood we are in today. You must know that on October 10, 1946, when we reluctantly withdrew from Zhangjiakou, we said to the people: "The days will not be too long. We will definitely return." We also used the same words to encourage some friends who were pessimistic and disappointed due to their unclear understanding of the situation. We told our enemies even more clearly: "The days will not be too long. We will definitely 'fight' our way back!"

    For two years and two months, we have been fighting for this solemn oath. We left guerrillas to operate in the suburbs of Zhangjiakou. Later, as the People's Liberation Army gradually grew stronger, this guerrilla force was reorganized into an independent regiment, and soon after, it was incorporated into a field army column. Seeing that we had so many troops, everyone's confidence was even greater, but our area of ​​activity moved away from Zhangjiakou. In the spring of 1948, the Chahar-Suiyuan Campaign began. When the troops set off to the north, we were very happy, thinking that this time we could fight our way back. Unexpectedly, after running for two months, an order suddenly transferred us to Yuxian County in Shanxi. After nine days of rapid marching, climbing over Mount Wutai and the Eighteen Bends, our divine troops appeared in front of the Nationalist bandit troops in Shijiazhuang, who were attempting to advance eastward to launch a sneak attack on the people, and smashed them to pieces. After the battle, we took a train to Zhengding for rest and reorganization. The soldiers said in disappointment, "We are guarding our old home. We won't be part of the fight for Zhangjiakou!" But how cleverly history arranged it, drawing our route back in such a tortuous way. In September, we were incorporated into the ×× Army Corps for the second expedition to Suiyuan. After three months of fighting, we heard that the powerful Northeast People's Liberation Army had entered the pass. Then, completely unexpectedly, on November 26, we received the order to attack Zhangjiakou, and it was precisely along the same road that the Nationalist bandits had taken when they launched a sneak attack on the people of Zhangjiakou: starting from Jining, passing through Xinghe, Shangyi, and Wanquan, we fought our way back.

    We were all excited and our hearts were pounding. Yang Yueming, the artillery company commander of a certain regiment, said, "Let's go, this time I'll be your guide!" Li Zhengwu, the squad leader of the third company of a certain regiment, which was formed by the Zhangjiakou City Patrol Brigade, said naively, "I think we should be assigned to garrison duty." People forgot the fatigue of three months of continuous marching and fighting and set off immediately. On the way, they only felt that they were walking too slowly, fearing that they would let the enemy escape. Because this time when we fought our way back, we would not only recover Zhangjiakou, but also annihilate the enemies who had occupied Zhangjiakou here! Let the Nationalist bandits know that Zhangjiakou, which they opportunistically occupied two years ago, had to be repaid with all their reactionary armed forces as interest. During the march, the soldiers overcame rugged mountain roads and harsh climate. When a certain unit crossed the Yang River, five pack animals fell into ice holes. Wei Changshan, the regimental commander, immediately took off all his clothes and jumped in, smashing open a path, and dragged the livestock to the shore in the ice flow that was belly-deep. His whole body was frozen purple, but he said, "It doesn't matter, for the sake of fighting for Zhangjiakou, it doesn't matter if we suffer a little more!"

    In this battle, the commanders and fighters regarded the most arduous and dangerous positions as their most glorious positions. Since December 7, after we surrounded the Nationalist bandit army's 11th Army Corps in Zhangjiakou, the soldiers began to live a wild life in the mountains. On the 8th, it snowed, and they crawled into those simple fortifications dug like saucers, holding their guns and watching the enemy. They had to wait for the cooks to bring food and water from villages more than ten miles away. The tin buckets were wrapped in quilts, but when they were carried to the mountains, the food was often cold. But no one complained. I once went to the forwardmost position of a certain regiment, which was guarding Huangtuliang, ten miles west of Zhangjiakou. It was a small hill. On the opposite Ci'er Mountain, which was no more than two miles away, the two- or three-point-tall black shadows that could be seen with the naked eye were the enemy. On our position was the sixth squad of the fifth company. They had transformed a green stone cement pillbox left by the enemy into a fighting group's position, while another group extended from here down to the middle of the mountain, building a bunker and three grenade-throwing rooms. A colored paper was pasted on the bunker, with the words "Surround Zhangjiakou tightly, don't let a single enemy escape!" The new soldier Ge Xiaoyuan told me that they had extreme confidence in holding this position because they had made all the preparations. Even when resting in the bunker, who was inside and who was outside, who would come out first and who would come out later in the event of a situation, and who would enter which position after coming out, had all been discussed and stipulated by the entire squad. The soldiers knew that their position was very important because it controlled the main road for the enemy to escape to the west. And they knew that if the enemy wanted to escape to the west, they would inevitably concentrate all their forces and all their artillery fire to attack them fiercely. At that time, this squad would stand at the forefront of the entire army and fight more than 50,000 enemies. But the soldiers were not afraid of this. On the contrary, they felt that this was their glory!

    That's how we besieged Zhangjiakou for half a month. The enemy was like a rat trapped in a cage, bumping east and west, trying to run but unable to escape. Every time they were beaten back by us.

    On the 23rd (this day should be written in red in history!), early in the morning, I crawled out of the small room made of door panels and earth where the political department of a certain regiment was located, and went to Huangtuliang with Li Changqi, the head of the propaganda team. We went to the sixth squad of the fifth company again. The sentry told me that the artillery fire in the northeast was fierce this morning, but the enemy on the opposite mountain had not moved. At this time, Pu Qingtang, the young instructor who had written a "blood letter of determination" to the party committee, ran from the company headquarters and told us that the main force of the Nationalist bandit army, the 35th Army headquarters and two divisions, had been completely annihilated by us in Xinbaoan. The soldiers clapped their hands. Instructor Pu said, "The enemy's old capital is gone, only what we are surrounding is left. Comrades, it's our turn to take action." Before he finished speaking, a battalion headquarters messenger ran up, panting, "Report to the instructor, the enemy is now concentrating nine regiments to break through to the north. The battalion commander said: Tell you to hurry up and pack your things and prepare to—attack!"

    Prepare to attack! Prepare to attack! The soldiers cheered immediately, busy packing their backpacks and tightening their shoelaces. At this time, when I turned my head, I saw several People's Liberation Army troops under Wanquan City to the west were heading north. The infantry was densely packed and connected into a line, with no end in sight. The cavalry stirred up a stream of dust, filling the air. A line of cars drove from Wanquan along the road to the foot of the mountain. Several senior commanders of the People's Liberation Army, wearing grass-green twill uniforms, walked up in quick steps and looked eastward with binoculars. Under their command, the Zhangyuan Great Battle to encircle and annihilate the Nationalist bandit army's 11th Army Corps began victoriously. The commanders and fighters shouted, "The opportunity to avenge the bandit army has arrived!" and plunged into the enemy ranks. Five battalions of a certain brigade stubbornly blocked the north, saying to them, "Even if the enemy is like a mountain collapsing, we will block it!" The Northeast brother troops pierced through Zhangjiakou like a steel knife from behind into the enemy's chest. The morale of the enemies, who were compressed into the snow-covered mountain valleys, immediately collapsed. The great battle turned into a lively scene of surrendering guns and capturing prisoners.

    On the evening of the 23rd, when we fought our way into Zhangjiakou, large numbers of prisoners of war began to be escorted down from outside Dajingmen. They were arranged in columns of four, columns of six, and columns of eight, flowing from north to south like a tide. The brave warriors of the People's Liberation Army rode on horses, holding submachine guns, running beside them in a dignified manner, shouting as they ran, "Walk properly! Keep up with the team!" Such columns of prisoners continued to walk continuously for a whole day on the 24th, completely filling Changqing Road, Mingde Avenue, and Jiefang Avenue. The people of Zhangjiakou, men, women, old, and young, crowded into the streets to watch the excitement. Some said humorously, "How you went out is how you came back. But where are your guns?"

    At 3:00 PM on the 24th, the battle ended. The five divisions, two cavalry brigades, and two security regiments of the Nationalist bandit army's 11th Army Corps were completely wiped out. Several high-ranking officials were also captured alive.

　　我们打回来了！
    郭锋、徐孔、宁干集体创作  郭锋执笔
    我们联同东北兄弟部队，在一九四八年十二月二十三日晚上，冒着扑面的飞雪打向张家口来了。当我们走过红旗招展的怡安街时，大家都故意把脚步放得很重，让它们踏在那条两年前我们亲手铺成的马路上察察作响，这响声好象在告诉街市上的人民：我们又回到张家口了。
    张家口的人民没有忘记解放军，他们不顾大镜门外响着的枪炮，跑到街上来欢迎我们。东北解放军的宣传卡车来了，人们一窝蜂似地拥挤到毛主席和朱总司令的照片跟前，高声欢呼。许多老百姓都来寻找他们的旧好：铁路工人熊剑峰在打听他的工友邱文泉同志的消息，水夫张沛新的女人，抱着两年前一位女教员留在她家的三岁小孩，跑到街上，逢人便问：“刘同志回来了吗？”在这一天里，到处可以听见这样的对话：“同志，你们可回来了，再晚来几天我们就见不上了。”“我们回来了，老乡。这两年你们受了多少苦呵！”
    如果这里有一个人，两年前没有到过张家口，没有参加过新张家口的建设，比方说，他没有拿着铁镐，流着汗水，和张家家口的人民在一起修筑过西沙河的堤坝，那么他今天就很难体会出我们是一种什么样的心情。要知道，在一九四六年十月十日，我们忍痛从张家口撤退时，曾经对人民这样说：“日子不会太长的，我们一定还要回来。”我们也用同样的话鼓励某些因对时局认识不清而悲观失望了的朋友，我们更把这句话告诉我们的敌人：“日子不会太长的，我们一定要‘打’回来！”
    两年零两个月，我们一直在为了这个沉痛的誓言而战斗着。我们留下了游击队在张市近郊活动。后来解放军逐渐壮大，这支游击队也编成独立团，而不久又编入野战纵队了。大家看见自己有这么多队伍，信心就更足了，但是我们活动的地区却离开了张家口。一九四八年春，察绥战役开始，部队出发往北走，我们就非常高兴，心想这次可打回来了。不料跑了两个月，突然一个命令把我们调到山西盂县去，连续九天急行军，爬过五台山、十八盘，神兵出现在企图东进偷袭人民的石家庄的国民党匪军面前，把他打了个稀烂。打完仗我们坐上火车到正定去休整，战士们失望地说：“守老家来了，打张家口没有咱们的份儿了！”但是历史安排得多么巧妙呵，它把我们打回来的路线划得这样曲折。九月间我们又编入××兵团第二次远征绥远了。转战三个月以后，听说强大的东北解放军打进关内来，紧接着，完全出乎意料之外地，在十一月二十六日，我们得到了打张家口的命令，而且恰恰是沿着当年国民党匪徒们偷袭人民的张家口时所走的同一道路：从集宁出发，经过兴和、尚义、万全等地打了回来。
    我们都兴奋得心跳起来了。某团炮兵连长杨月明说：“走，这回打进去，我给你们当向导！”由张家口市巡察大队编成的某团第三连一班长李正武天真地说：“我看该叫咱们担任卫戍了。”人们忘记了三个月连续行军作战的疲劳，马上出发了。一路上只是嫌走得太慢，惟恐放跑了敌人。因为我们这次打回去，不仅要收复张家口，还要把当年侵占张家口的敌人歼灭在这里！让国民党匪徒知道：两年前投机占去了的张家口，是要他拿上他的全部反动武装作为利息来偿还的。在行军中，战士们战胜了崎岖山路和严寒的气候。某部过洋河时，五个驮子陷在冰窟里，团长魏常山立刻脱光衣服跳下去，砸开一条路，在水深及腹的冰流里，将牲口拉上了岸。他混身都冻得发紫了，却说：“不要紧，为了打张家口，再苦点也不算什么！”
    在这次战斗中，指战员们把最艰苦最危险的岗位当作他们的最光荣的岗位。自从十二月七日我们包围了张家口的国民党匪军十一兵团以后，战士们就开始在山上过起野居的生活来了。八日下雪，他们就爬在那挖成碟子似的简单工事里，抱着枪监视敌人。他们吃饭喝水都要等炊事员从十里以外的村落送来，洋铁桶用棉被包着，抬到山上时却往往是饭冷菜凉了。但是没有一个人叫苦。我曾经到扼守在张家口以西十里的黄土梁上的某团最前沿阵地，那是一坐小山包，在对面相距不过二里的赐儿山上，肉眼能望见的二三分高的黑影，就是敌人。在我们阵地上的是五连第六班。他们把敌人扔下的一座青石洋灰碉堡改造成一个战斗小组的阵地，另一小组则从这里往下伸到半山腰，筑起一个地堡和三个投弹室。地堡上贴着一张色纸，上写“紧紧包围张家口，不放一个敌人跑掉！”新战士葛小元告诉我，他们对固守这个阵地信心极高，因为他们一切准备都作好了，甚至于在地堡里休息时，谁在里谁在外，发生情况谁先出谁后出，出来后谁进入那个阵地，都经过全班讨论作了规定。战士们知道自己的阵地是非常险要的，因为它控制着敌人西逃的大路。并且他们知道倘若敌人要往西跑，必然要集中所有兵力所有炮火向他们猛攻，那时他们这个班就要站在全军的最前线和五万多敌人抟斗。但是战士们并不怕这个，他们反而觉得这正是他们的光荣！
    就是这样，我们把张家口围困了半个月。敌人象只打在笼子里的老鼠，东碰西撞，想跑却跑不出，每次都被我们打回去。
    二十三日（这一天应该用红笔写在历史上！）清晨，我从某团政治处所住的那间拿门板和土盖成的小屋里爬出来，随着宣传组长李长岐到黄土梁上去。我们又到了五连第六班那里，放哨的战士告诉我：今早东北方炮声激烈，对面山上敌人没甚动作。这时，那个曾经给党委写过“决心血书”的年青指导员蒲庆堂从连部跑来，告诉我们：国民党匪军主力三十五军军部和两个师在新保安被我全部歼灭。战士们听了拍起巴掌来。蒲指导员说：“敌人的老本就算光了，只剩下咱们围着的这点啦。同志们，这回该轮到咱们动手了。”话音未落，一个营部通信员气喘喘地跑来：“报告指导员，现在敌人集中九个团向北突围，营长说的：叫你们赶快收拾东西，准备—出击！”
    准备出击！准备出击！战士们立刻欢腾起来了，一个个忙着打背包，系紧鞋带。这时我一回头，就见西面万全城下好几路解放军正向北开，步兵密密麻麻联成一线，前不见头，后不见尾。骑兵荡起一溜尘烟，弥漫空中。一轮汽车从万全顺着公路开到山下，几位着草绿色斜纹布军装的解放军高级指挥员，三步并两步地走上来，用望远镜朝东了望。在他们指挥下，围歼国民党匪军十一兵团的张垣大会战胜利开始了。指战员们喊了声：“向匪军报仇的机会到了！”一踪身杀进了敌群。某旅的五个营向北面顽强地阻击着对他们说：“敌人象座大山倒下来，我们也挡住它！”东北兄弟部队穿过张市象把钢刀从背后插进了敌人的胸膛，于是被压缩在下满雪的山沟里的士气低落的敌人，立刻土崩瓦解，大会战变成缴枪捉俘虏的热闹场面。
    二十三日晚上，我们打进张家口时，就开始有大批的俘虏，从大镜门外押送下来了。他们排成四列纵队、六列纵队、八列纵队象潮水一样从北往南流，解放军的勇士骑在马上，端着冲锋枪，威风凛凛地向他们旁边跑着，边跑边喊：“走好了！跟上队！”象这样的俘虏行列二十四日又连续不断走了一整天，把长清路、明德大街和解放大街完全塞满了。张家口的人民男女老少都挤到街上来看热闹，有的诙谐地说：“怎么出去的又怎么回来了。可是，你们的枪呢？”
    二十四日下午三时，战斗结束了，国民党匪军十一兵团五个师，两个骑兵旅和两个保安团全军覆没。几个大官也被活捉了。
