[News from this newspaper] After completing land reform and party rectification work in December of last year, Nanbu Village, Second District of Licheng, the relationship between party member cadres and the masses has been further improved. The whole village is harmonious and united. Under the leadership of the party branch and the People's Congress, they are intensively carrying out production and spring plowing preparations.
    On New Year's Day of the old lunar calendar, the village held a full branch meeting to discuss how to lead the masses to organize production to become rich this year, as well as preferential treatment for military families, land cultivation on their behalf, and the Lantern Festival entertainment. Finally, it was decided to have unified leadership and division of responsibilities, and it was conveyed to all cadres through the People's Congress that evening. On the second day of the new year, a mass meeting of the whole village was held. In addition to repeatedly explaining the party's production policy after land reform and the road to prosperity, they also summarized and affirmed the achievements and experiences of previous mutual aid production, and mobilized the masses to conduct a review of shortcomings. After deliberation, it was discovered that three groups last year had not closed their accounts on time, and some leaders were not democratic enough, causing ideological knots among the group members. After discussing these issues and clarifying them with each other, they discussed how to organize and lead mutual aid production this year. Shen Kao-xu said: "According to my personal experience, I feel that production must be organized. In the past few years, we didn't have livestock, and we didn't organize mutual aid. It was really difficult to grow crops. After participating in the mutual aid group in the past two years, it is different from before. I understand the principle of organizing production to become rich." At this time, the village cadres also explained the three principles of voluntary, equivalent value, and democratic mutual aid, and the masses began to deliberate and connect to combine. There are a total of 196 households in the village, 161 households are organized, and 35 households are not organized. These few days they are finding people to connect with the groups. (Editor's note: At one meeting, 82 percent of the households in the village were organized, which obviously indicates that the deliberation and combination time was too short, and it is easy to have the problem of forced mutual aid in disguise. Has this committed the old mistake of empirical rectification of mutual aid methods again? It is hoped that this will be checked. The best way is to mobilize the masses' conscious mutual aid in thought through mobilization and discussion, and then to grasp the backbone and leaders and let the masses freely connect, touch hearts, and touch groups, without being restricted by time, and simply pursuing numerical figures.) In order to facilitate leadership, 29 mutual aid groups voluntarily combined into seven large teams, and formulated systems and methods such as equal value and exchange of labor. Then, the issue of preferential treatment for military families and cultivating land on their behalf was re-discussed, and a new land cultivation plan was discussed. According to the different situations of the military families, it was decided that three households would receive full land cultivation, ten households would receive partial land cultivation, and the remaining three households would mainly help the military families to work and produce on their own, and establish household affairs. This plan was also specifically solicited from the military families, allowing the military families to voluntarily join the mutual aid groups, both parties agreed, fixed the groups, and cultivated the land on their behalf.
    At present, each mutual aid group and team in the village has formulated a short-term production plan: before the tenth day of the second lunar month, the main tasks are to deliver manure, transport coal and firewood, prepare fuel, and combine with sideline activities. These days, the whole village is delivering manure. On the sixth day of the new year alone, 1,856 loads of manure were delivered.

　　黎城南堡村结束土改后
    如何及时转入生产？
    【本报讯】黎城二区南堡村，于去年十二月完成结束土地改革与整党工作后，党员干部和群众的关系得到进一步的改善，全村和谐团结，在党的支部和人代会的领导下，紧张地进行生产和春耕准备工作。
    旧历新年元旦日，该村召开全支部大会，讨论今年如何领导群众组织起来生产发家致富及优军代耕与元宵节娱乐等问题，最后决定统一领导，分工负责，并于当晚通过人代会，贯彻到全体干部中。初二日即召开全村群众大会，除反复讲解土地改革后党的生产政策及发家致富的道路外，并总结与肯定了以往互助生产的成绩和经验与发动群众进行了缺点的检查。经过酝酿，发现去年有三个组没有按时结帐，并有的领导不够民主，闹得组员有了思想疙瘩。这些问题，经过讨论都互相扯通后，即讨论今年互助生产如何组织领导等问题。申考绪说：“据我的亲身经历，感到生产非得组织起来不行，前几年咱没牲口，也没组织互助，养种庄稼真是困难。这二年参加了互助组以后，就和从前不一样了，组织起来生产致富，这个道理我是想通了”。这时村干部又把组织互助的自愿、等价、民主的三个原则讲了一下，群众便酝酿串通进行结合。全村共有一百九十六户，组织起来的一百六十一户，没有组织起来的三十五户，这几天正在找人碰组。（编者按：一个会上，全村百分之八十二的户数即组织起来，显然酝酿结合时间太短，并易出变相强迫互助的毛病，这是否又犯了以往经验主义的整顿互助方法呢？尚希检查一下。最好的办法是经过动员讨论，在思想上发动了群众的互助自觉后，抓住骨干有领导的放手让群众自由串通，碰心碰组，不要受时间限制，而又单纯的追逐数目字。）为了便利领导，廿九个互助组小组，又自愿结合了七个大队，订出了等价变工等制度和办法。接着重新讨论了优军代耕问题，讨论出新的代耕计划。根据军属家庭不同情况，决定三户全受代耕，十户代耕一部，其余三户主要帮助军属自己劳动生产，建立家务。这个计划，又专门征求了军属意见，让军属自愿碰入互助小组，双方协议，固定小组，把地代耕起来。
    目前该村各个互助组、队，均订出了短期生产计划：阴历二月初十日以前主要是送粪、驮煤打柴，准备好烧的，并结合副业活动。这几天全村都在送粪，仅初六日一天，即送出粪一千八百五十六驮。
