The people of Shandong mobilized over 5.8 million people between July 1946 and September 1948 (two years and three months) to support the front lines of the People's Liberation War. They undertook tasks such as transportation, stretcher-bearing, transferring materials, destroying roads, and repairing roads. They made outstanding and arduous contributions in coordinating with the East China People's Liberation Army in several nationally renowned battles, including Subei, Lunan, Laiwu, Tai'an, Menglianggu, Weifang, Yanzhou, and Jinan. Tens of thousands of civilian laborers crossed Mount Tai and forded the Yellow River, accompanying the army on expeditions to the Central Plains. This was a historic and unprecedented feat by the Party, government, and people of Shandong. The two years and three months of supporting the front lines was a developmental process from passive to active, from unorganized to organized, from without systems to with systems, and from without experience to with experience. Therefore, the experience of the Shandong people in this heavy work can be provided as a reference for other liberated areas.

The work of Shandong's support for the front lines of the People's Liberation War before the Huaihai Campaign can be divided into three periods:

The first period was from the beginning of the Liberation War in July 1946 to the end of the Lunan Campaign in January 1947. At that time, the center of the East China battlefield was on the southern front (such as Central and Northern Jiangsu). In Shandong, there was only partial contact with the enemy along the Jiaoji Railway and the Lintai Line (Lincheng-Taierzhuang). It was not until the Subei and Lunan campaigns in December 1946 that large numbers of civilian laborers were mobilized to support the front lines. After the Subei Campaign, the East China Field Army concentrated its forces for combat, and the war supply was heavy. Because there was no organization or plan in advance, manpower and food were mobilized on a temporary basis, making it difficult to ensure the timely supply of the front-line troops. At that time, the leading organs at all levels did not have a sufficient understanding of the long-term nature of the war, and did not make long-term plans for the work. The support for the front lines was mostly based on principle arrangements, and the specific work was left to the localities to handle on their own. Therefore, although a large number of civilian laborers were mobilized to support the front-line operations, the overall work in the area was basically passive and chaotic. No in-depth political mobilization was carried out among the civilian laborers, nor was the production of civilian laborer families organized. The organization of civilian laborers was unsound, cadres lacked experience, the burden of civilian labor was unreasonable, and the phenomena of hiring, forced conscription, and assignment were extremely common, resulting in serious desertion among civilian laborers. In terms of the use of civilian labor in the front, there was no allocation system. Any unit or any organ could freely mobilize civilian laborers in the villages; at the same time, there was no fixed system for the use of civilian laborers. The troops would allocate as many as they needed. The troops often only cared about their own interests, fearing that the civilian laborers would desert, and only wanted more civilian laborers; the local governments, on the other hand, were afraid of failing to complete the task, and often increased the originally assigned numbers by several percent when mobilizing civilian laborers, so that large numbers of civilian laborers often traveled back and forth in vain, resulting in a serious waste of manpower.

The second period was from the beginning of the Laiwu Campaign in February 1947 to the Nanma and Linqu campaigns in July. This was the most tense and task-heavy period for the Shandong people to support the front lines. At this time, the Kuomintang reactionaries concentrated hundreds of thousands of elite main force troops to launch a key offensive against our central Shandong area. The scale of the war was increasing, and the supply of manpower and materials was becoming increasingly heavy. In order to strengthen the work of supporting the front lines, the East China Bureau of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China and the Shandong Provincial People's Government first reorganized the Provincial Support the Front Lines Committee in January 1947, and transferred a large number of cadres to strengthen leadership. Under the Provincial Support the Front Lines Committee, there were established manpower, food, civilian station, political, people's armed forces departments, and a secretariat to unify the leadership of the province's support for the front lines work. The administrative offices, prefectural offices, and county governments also established support the front lines organizations separately. At the same time, the guiding principles of comprehensively organizing civilian labor, saving manpower, and long-term planning were determined, and the slogan of combining the three major tasks of supporting the front lines, production, and land reform was put forward, and the allocation of manpower and food, the use and management education of civilian laborers and other systems were initially established and unified. On the troop side, established stretcher teams (including within the troop establishment) were gradually established below the regiment level. Each column was equipped with a certain number of standing civilian laborer stretcher teams to jointly undertake the task of transferring wounded soldiers from the corps dressing station to the column hospital. In addition, each column was equipped with accompanying "standing transportation civilian laborers," and the service period (six-month term) and demobilization procedures for standing civilian laborers were stipulated. The troops provided certain living care for the civilian laborer teams. After this reorganization, Shandong's support for the front lines work began to enter a stage of organization, planning, and systems. During this stage, the organization and education of civilian laborers were strengthened. According to the different nature and tasks of civilian laborers, the organization was divided into three types: "accompanying the army," "standing," and "temporary" civilian laborer organizations. The allocation of cadres, party members, and activists in civilian laborers was increased, and political, current affairs, and military education was carried out for civilian laborers during the intervals of war. Activities such as merit-making and civilian-loving-civilian movements were carried out among civilian laborers. Attention was paid to the combination of supporting the front lines and production, mutual aid in production was generally organized, and women were mobilized to participate in production mutual aid groups, thereby solving the production problems of civilian laborer families. The troops held get-togethers with civilian laborers, handled demobilization upon expiration, and democratically handled runaway civilian laborers. In addition, the government also established civilian stations along the transportation lines to ensure food and lodging for civilian laborers, and equipped them with medicines to treat civilian laborer diseases. Therefore, civilian laborers were greatly consolidated compared to the first period. In the civilian laborer teams, many examples of caring for the wounded, cherishing public property, enduring hunger and cold, overcoming difficulties, and resolutely completing tasks emerged. However, on the other hand, there were still the following shortcomings in the work: (1) Some localities underestimated the war situation, believing that the central Shandong battle at that time was "climbing mountain tops," and when mobilizing the masses, they put forward wrong slogans such as "one hoe transaction" (meaning not making long-term plans), lacking in-depth and meticulous political mobilization, and in organization, they adopted the erroneous methods of "cadres taking the lead in charging" and mass rallies to encourage "voluntary" registration, which were disguised forced orders and simplifications. (2) At that time, the war situation was extremely tense, the tasks were heavy, the cadre force was limited, and the bandit army gradually penetrated into our hinterland. At this time, proposing that the three major tasks of supporting the front lines, production, and land reform be carried out at the same time actually restricted each other and greatly affected the work of supporting the front lines.

The third period was from August 1947, when our East China Army launched an offensive on the outer lines, to the Jinan Campaign in September 1948. After more than half a year of production and disaster relief movements and party rectification and military reorganization last year, the awareness of the entire Party, the entire army, and the entire people of Shandong has been raised a step, and the work of supporting the front lines has also been raised a step on the basis of the past. During this stage, the Shandong people successively supported the victorious operations of the People's Liberation Army on the western and central sections of the Jiaoji Railway and the Jinpu Railway, and finally assisted the People's Liberation Army in removing Jinan, the largest strategic stronghold of the Kuomintang bandit army in Shandong. The work of supporting the front lines during this period showed more organization, planning, and initiative than in the past. This feature is first manifested in the full political mobilization. Before the Jinan Campaign, the East China Central Bureau of the Communist Party of China issued instructions and mobilization orders for war and support for the front lines, and various localities also carried out in-depth mobilization under the slogan of "Attack Jinan and Capture Wang Yaowu Alive." The East China Bureau also transferred nearly a thousand cadres to strengthen the leadership of this work, and the Party and government organs in various localities also transferred a large number of strong cadres to participate in the work of supporting the front lines. Secondly, the Jinan Campaign was during the autumn harvest, and it was also proposed that the two major tasks of supporting the front lines and production must be completed at the same time, and it was repeatedly instructed that various localities should overcome one-sidedness ideologically and scientifically allocate cadre forces organizationally.

In the mobilization of civilian labor, the method of unified scheduling of manpower throughout the province was adopted. Most villages organized support the front lines production committees. After the civilian laborers set off, the village's production was either helped by mutual aid groups, or it was farmed or planted on behalf of or contracted by designated persons in the village. In this way, it not only guaranteed the production of the families of the civilian laborers who set off and consolidated the civilian laborers, but also completed the production of the entire village. The burden of manpower was also fairer and more reasonable than before. Various localities adopted the method of mass democratic appraisal when mobilizing labor, so that those who had worked less in the past would go first, and those who had worked more in the past would go later, and attention was paid to strengthening the allocation of cadres, thus ensuring the consolidation of the civilian laborer teams. Even in the worst mobilized areas, the average desertion rate was no more than 5 percent. In addition, full preparations were also made for the supply of grain and non-staple food. In this way, not only was the work of supporting the front lines completed, but also the work of autumn harvest, autumn plowing, and autumn planting was completed. The peasants said, "In the past, supporting the front delayed production, but this year it has promoted production." The main shortcomings of the work during this period were: at the beginning of the battle, quite common cadres started from a narrow mass viewpoint, emphasizing production and neglecting the work of supporting the front lines, and were not serious about the war work. After correction, there was also a bias towards neglecting production. In terms of grain supply, public grain was not clean, and some rice bags contained sand, affecting the food of the front-line troops and civilian laborers. At the beginning, the standard of grain supply for civilian laborers was set low, and they were generally hungry, and individual localities encroached on the interests of the residents in the stationed areas. In addition, some areas neglected the work of civilian stations and did not establish civilian stations universally and quickly, affecting the consolidation of civilian laborers. These shortcomings are now being actively improved.

　　山东人民两年来支援前线的经过
    山东人民在一九四六年七月至一九四八年九月两年零三个月中，先后组织了五百八十余万人支援人民解放战争前线，担任运输、担架、转移物资、破路、修路等工作，在配合华东人民解放军在宿北、鲁南、莱芜、泰安、孟良崮、潍坊、兖州、济南等全国闻名的诸次战役中，作了卓越的艰苦的贡献。并有成千成万的民工翻泰山，涉黄河，随军远征中原。这是山东的党、政、民具有历史性的空前壮举。两年零三个月的支援前线工作，是由被动到主动，由无组织到有组织，由无制度到有制度，由无经验到有经验的发展过程。因此，山东人民在这个繁重工作中的经验，可以供给其他解放区的参考。
    淮海战役前山东支援人民解放战争前线的工作可分为三个时期：
    从一九四六年七月解放战争开始至一九四七年一月鲁南战役结束为第一个时期。当时华东战场的中心在南线（苏中、苏北等地），山东方面，仅在胶济沿线及临（临城）台（台儿庄）线与敌进行部分接触，直至一九四六年十二月宿（宿迁）北、鲁南战役时，才开始调动大批民工，支援前线。宿北战役后，华东野战军集中作战，战争供应繁重，因事先无组织，无计划，人力、粮食都是临时动员，难以保证前线部队的及时供应。当时各级领导机关思想上对战争长期性认识不足，工作不作长期打算，对支援前线工作多原则布置，具体工作则责成各地自行处理，因此虽动员了大批民力，支援了前线作战，但全区工作基本上是被动和混乱的。对民工没有进行深入的政治动员，也没有组织民工家庭生产，民工组织不健全，干部经验缺乏，民力负担不合理，加上雇佣、拉夫、指派等极普遍，以致民工逃亡严重。前方在使用民力上，无调拨制度，任何部队、任何机关均可随便到村动员民工；同时，也没有一定的民工使用制度，部队要多少即拨多少。部队往往只顾本位利益，怕民工逃亡，只想多要些民工；地方政府则怕完不成任务，动员民工时多将原分配数字增加几成后往下分派，于是大批民工常常往返徒劳，发生民力严重浪费的现象。
    自一九四七年二月莱芜战役开始至七月南麻、临驹战役为第二个时期。这是山东人民支援前线最紧张、任务最繁重的时期。此时国民党反动派集中了数十万精锐主力军向我鲁中山区作重点进攻，战争规模日大，人力物力供应亦益加繁重。中共中央华东局和山东省人民政府为加强支援前线工作，于一九四七年一月首先改组省支援前线委员会，增调大批干部，加强领导。在省支援前线委员会下设人力、粮食、民站、政治、人民武装各部及秘书处，统一领导全省支援前线工作。各行署、专署、县府也分别建立了支援前线机构。同时确定了全面组织民力、节约人力、长期打算等方针，提出了支援前线、生产、土地改革三大任务相结合的口号，初步建立和统一了人力和粮食的调拨、民工使用和管理教育等制度。部队方面，团以下逐渐建立了建制担架（包括在部队建制以内），每纵队配备一定的常备民工担架，共同担负兵团包扎所至纵队医院的伤员转运任务。另每纵队配备随军“常备运输民工”，规定了常备民工服务期限（半年期）和复员手续。部队对民工队有一定的生活照顾。经此整理，山东支援前线工作遂开始步入有组织、有计划、有制度的阶段。在此阶段内，加强了民工的组织和教育。根据民工性质任务不同，组织上分为“随军”、“常备”与“临时”三种民工组织，增加了民工中干部、党员、积极分子的配备，并利用战争间隙，对民工进行政治的、时事的、军事的教育。在民工中开展了立功和民爱民运动，开始注意了支援前线和生产的结合，普遍组织了生产互助，发动了妇女参加生产互助组，从而解决了民工家属生产问题。部队举行与民工联欢，办理到期复员，民主处理逃亡民工。此外政府还在各交通线上遍设民站以保证民工食宿，配备医药以治疗民工疾病，因此民工较第一个时期大为巩固。在各民工队中，涌现了许多爱护伤员、爱护公物、忍饥耐寒、克服困难、坚决完成任务的范例。但另一方面，工作中仍有以下缺点：（一）有些地方对战争形势估计不足，认为当时鲁中会战是“爬山头”，在向群众动员时，曾提出“一锄子买卖”（即不作长期打算的意思）等错误口号，缺乏深入细致的政治动员，在组织上即采取了“干部带头打冲锋”、大会鼓动“自愿”报名等变相的强迫命令和简单化的错误作法。（二）当时战争情况极端紧张，任务繁重，干部力量有限，加之匪军逐步深入我腹地，这时提出支援前线、生产、土地改革三大任务一齐进行，反而使工作互相牵制，相当地影响了支援前线的工作。
    自一九四七年八月华东我军外线出击至一九四八年九月济南战役为第三个时期。经过去年半年多的生产救灾运动和整党整军后，山东的全党全军和全体人民觉悟提高了一步，支援前线工作也在过去基础上提高了一步。山东人民在此阶段内，先后支援了解放军在胶济西段、中段及津浦线的胜利作战，并最后协助解放军拔除了国民党匪军在山东境内最大的战略要地济南。这一时期支援前线的工作，表现了比过去有更多的组织性、计划性和主动性。这一特点首先表现在充分的进行了政治动员。中共华东中央局于济南战役前，颁发了战争与支援前线的指示和动员令，各地亦在“打进济南府，活捉王耀武”的口号下作了深入的动员。华东局并抽调了近千干部加强这一工作的领导，各地党政机关也均抽调了大批坚强的干部参加支援前线的工作。其次，济南战役正值秋收，又提出支援前线和生产两大任务必须同时完成，一再指示各地要在思想上克服片面性，在组织上科学分配干部力量。
    在调动民力上，采取全省人力统一调度的办法。各村大部组织了支援前线生产委员会。民工出发后，村中生产有的采取互助组帮助的办法，有的由村内指定人代耕代种或包耕包种。这样，既保证了出发民工家中的生产，巩固了民工，也完成了全村的生产。在人力负担上亦较前公平合理。各地动员出工多采用群众民主评议办法使过去出工少者先出，过去出工多者后出，并注意加强干部的配备，因而保证了民工队的巩固。即动员最差的地区平均逃亡不过百分之五。此外，对粮食及副食供应亦作了充分的准备。这样，既完成了支援前线的工作，也完成了秋收、秋耕、秋种工作。农民们说：“过去支前耽误了生产，今年却推动了生产。”这一时期工作的主要缺点是：在战役开始时，相当普遍的干部从狭隘的群众观点出发，重视生产轻视支援前线的工作，对战争工作不认真，后经纠正，又发生过轻视生产的偏向。在粮食供应上，公粮不洁净，有些米袋内掺含有砂子，影响前方部队和民工的食用。开始时民工粮食供给标准订得低，普遍饿肚子，有个别地方发生侵犯驻地群众利益的现象。另外，有些地区忽视民站工作，未普遍迅速建立民站，影响了民工的巩固。这些缺点现正积极改进中。
