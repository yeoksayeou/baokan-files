Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 14th. Washington Dispatch: The Eighty-First Congress, controlled by the Democratic and Republican parties, convened on January 3rd and is now in the stage where various standing committees are discussing various "bills." Among the large pile of "bills" that have been put forward, the most notable are two bills that indicate the Truman government will continue to implement foreign aggression and domestic repression. From this day forward, the Foreign Affairs Committees of both houses of Congress will begin hearing opinions on Truman's proposed fifteen-month (from April 1st) $5.58 billion continued aid-to-Europe plan. Secretary of State Acheson and the head of the so-called "Economic Cooperation Administration," Hoffman, attended the committee on the 8th and expressed their support for the above-mentioned aggressive plan. Hoffman also revealed that the US government will separately propose a plan to aid the Kuomintang reactionary traitorous clique in order to support the remaining Kuomintang forces in a dying struggle.

Since the Truman government continues to implement a policy of aggression abroad, it is bound to continue to implement a policy of anti-communist and anti-labor suppression at home. US Labor Secretary Tobin, when testifying before the Senate Labor Committee on the 4th regarding the so-called labor bill proposed by Truman, thoroughly exposed the deceptive nature of Truman's campaign promise to abolish the anti-labor law. Tobin hypocritically requested the abolition of the provision in the bill prohibiting communists from serving as union cadres, but then suggested that legislation on the entire communist issue should stipulate that communists be prohibited from serving as union cadres. Truman's speech at a press conference on the same day also proved that the new labor law he proposed is essentially a replica of the Taft-Hartley Act. Truman hypocritically demanded the cancellation of the provision in the Taft-Hartley Act authorizing courts to stop strikes for eighty days, but instead advocated for a "thirty-day cooling-off period." Regarding the Taft-Hartley Act's provision authorizing courts to prohibit "emergency strikes," Truman revealed his ferocious features, saying that as President and Commander-in-Chief of the Army, Navy, and Air Force, he has the power to stop strikes that "threaten national security and welfare" without the need for additional powers in the labor law.

### 美国会正讨论反动法案　杜鲁门凶相毕露  继续对外侵略对内压迫

　　美国会正讨论反动法案
  　杜鲁门凶相毕露
    继续对外侵略对内压迫
    【新华社陕北十四日电】华盛顿讯：民主共和党控制的第八十一届国会，于一月三日开会后，现正处于各常设委员会讨论各种“法案”的阶段中。在已提出的一大堆“法案”中，最引人注意的是表明杜鲁门政府将继续执行对外侵略及对内压迫的两个法案。自即日起，国会两院外交委员会开始听取杜鲁门所提的为期十五个月（自四月一日起）的五十五亿八千万美元的继续援欧计划之意见。国务卿艾奇逊及所谓“经合总署”署长霍夫曼八日出席该委员会，发表支持上述侵略计划的意见。霍夫曼并透露，美政府将另外提出援助国民党反动卖国集团的计划，以支持残存的国民党势力，进行垂死的挣扎。
    杜鲁门政府既然对外继续执行侵略政策，对内就必然要继续执行反共反劳工的镇压政策。美劳工部长托宾四日在参院劳工委员会就杜鲁门提出的所谓劳工法案举证时，彻底地暴露了杜鲁门竞选时关于废除该反劳工法的诺言之欺骗性。托宾假惺惺地要求废除该法案中关于禁止共产党人担任工会干部的规定，但随即建议在关于整个共产党问题的立法中，规定禁止共产党人担任工会干部。杜鲁门同日在招待记者会上的发言，也证明了他所提出的新劳工法，实质上是塔夫脱——哈特莱法的翻版。杜鲁门虚伪地要求取消塔夫脱——哈特莱法中授权法庭制止罢工八十天的规定，但却主张代以“三十天的冷静期”。关于塔哈法授权法庭禁止“紧急罢工”的规定，杜鲁门凶相毕露地说：他以总统兼海陆空军大元帅的身份，有权制止“威胁国家安全和福利”的罢工，而不须在劳工法里额外规定权力。
