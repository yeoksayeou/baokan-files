　　District Office Should Find Ways to Expedite Delivery of Letters to Soldiers' Families Editor Comrade:
    I work in the Second Field Hospital. I handle correspondence to and from the wounded and sick soldiers. When the wounded soldiers arrive, they write home one after another, and they constantly long for letters from home. But sometimes they can't get them even when they are discharged from the hospital. Some can't receive them for two or three months. According to family members who come to visit, most of the letters are kept in the district office, and they are only brought home by the village cadres when they go to the district office for meetings, and some only receive them after two months. I suggest that the district offices should find ways to expedite the delivery of letters to soldiers' families and overcome this irresponsible phenomenon. Because this will cause dissatisfaction among family members, anxiety among the wounded soldiers, and losses to our work.

　　区公所对战士家信应设法迅速转送编辑同志：
    我在野二所工作，伤病员来往信件都经过我手，伤员下来纷纷往家写信，信一走后，时时渴望着家中信来，但有时等至出院时，也等不到，有隔两三月，还收不到的。据各方家属来时说，大部信是放在区公所，等他村村干部到区公所开会时才捎给他家，有隔两个月才收到的，我提个意见，各区公所对战士家信应设法迅速转送，克服此不负责现象。因这样会使家属不满，伤员情绪不安，工作受损失。
