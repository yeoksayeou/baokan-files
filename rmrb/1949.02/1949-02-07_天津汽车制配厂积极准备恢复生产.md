　　Tianjin Automotive Manufacturing Plant Actively Prepares to Resume Production
　　[Xinhua News Agency, Tianjin, January 23rd] Belated news: The major part of the North China's largest automotive industry, the Pingjin District Automotive Repair Plant of the Highway Administration Bureau of the puppet government's Ministry of Communications, has been taken over by personnel sent by the Tianjin Municipal Military Control Commission and is actively preparing to resume production. The Pingjin District Automotive Repair Plant originally had jurisdiction over seven factories: namely Tianjin Automotive Manufacturing Plant, Tianjin Automotive Repair Plant, Tianjin Rubber Factory, Beijing Automotive Repair Plant, Qingdao Automotive Repair Plant, Jinan Automotive Repair Plant, and Shijiazhuang Automotive Repair Plant, the main parts of which are all in Tianjin. The Tianjin Automotive Manufacturing Plant has new equipment, with new lathes equipped with small motors and electric sandblasting machines in the foundry. However, under the rule of the Kuomintang, productivity sharply declined: in October 1946, the factory manufactured three-wheeled vehicles, but due to the influx of American goods, it was forced to stop work after producing less than a hundred vehicles, and the semi-finished bodywork is still scattered in the factory. Last November, the factory merged with the Zhangjiakou Comprehensive Machinery Factory to produce munitions. Special machine parts for manufacturing auto parts were left aside in a mess, covered with thick dust, and no one cared about them. The Tianjin Automotive Repair Plant almost stopped production before liberation. The number of employees dropped from more than 500 when Japan surrendered on August 15th to 137. The Rubber Factory, according to its production equipment, can produce not only car tires, but also 100 to 200 bicycle tires per day, but before liberation, it only produced dozens of bicycle tires. The factory's technical staff expressed extreme resentment at the Kuomintang's various measures to destroy industry. Thanks to the protection of the People's Liberation Army and the factory's employees, the above three factories are now intact. According to statistics on the 22nd, nearly 96% of the personnel at the Manufacturing Plant have reported for duty. On the same day, they officially started work and are now organizing the machines to prepare for resumption of work. All employees of the Repair Plant and Rubber Factory have reported for duty. The former partially started production on the 19th and repaired 14 vehicles in four days. Once power is restored, it can fully resume work; the latter can resume work once fuel is resolved. The employees of the three factories had difficulties in life under the rule of the Kuomintang. Their daily income was only enough to buy a pound of corn flour. And workers were sometimes laid off at will. The workers were very excited after the liberation of Tianjin and their enthusiasm for production was very high. The workers of the Manufacturing Plant also checked the wires on Sunday in order to resume production as soon as possible.
　　[Xinhua News Agency, Tianjin, 4th] The restoration of public utilities in Tianjin has continued to achieve important results due to the correct leadership of the Military Control Commission and the efforts of all employees. The water supply from the Tianjin Waterworks and the Ji'an Water Company has completely returned to normal. All tram and bus lines in the city have fully resumed traffic. On the 21st of last month alone, 82 trams were dispatched, selling more than 66,000 tickets. Jibei and other power companies have repaired all the main transmission lines in the city, and the power supply has reached more than 2 million kilowatts. All government agencies and major factories, as well as the electricity for major citizens, have been fully supplied. Of the more than 16,000 telephones in the city, more than 10,000 have been restored to communication. After the resumption of business by the Administrative Bureau and its branches, the number of mails has increased daily, from 57 pieces to 6,743 pieces in the four days from the 18th to the 21st of last month. The Pingjin Railway and the Tianjin to Chenguantun section of the Jinpu Railway have officially opened for ticket sales, and passengers are extremely crowded.

　　天津汽车制配厂积极准备恢复生产
    【新华社天津一月二十三日电】迟到消息：华北最大的汽车工业，伪政府交通部公路总局平津区汽车修配厂之主要部分，已由津市军管会派员接管，正积极准备恢复生产。平津区汽车修配厂原辖七厂：即天津汽车制配厂、天津汽车修理厂、天津橡胶厂、北平汽车修理厂、青岛汽车修理厂、济南汽车修理厂及石家庄汽车修理厂，其主要部分均在天津。天津汽车制配厂设备新颖，有带有小型电动机的新式镟床和翻沙间的电气吹沙机等。但在国民党统治下生产力锐减：一九四六年十月该厂曾制造三轮汽车，后因美货充斥，出货不及百辆即被迫停工，半成品之车身现仍散乱厂内。去年十一月，该厂与张家口综合机器厂合并，改制军火，制造汽车零件的特殊机件则被乱置一旁，厚积灰尘，无人过问。天津汽车修理厂解放前几陷停工，职工自“八一五”日本投降时的五百多人减至一百三十七人。橡胶厂按其生产装备除能制造汽车轮胎外，每日可生产一、二百副自行车胎，但解放前仅生产几十副自行车胎。厂内技术员工对国民党摧残工业之种种措施，极表愤恨。由于人民解放军及该厂职工的保护，上述三厂现均完好无损。据二十二日统计，制配厂报到人数已近百分之九十六，同日已正式上班，现正整理机器，作复工准备。修理厂及橡胶厂职工已全部报到，前者十九日已部分开始生产，四日内修理车子十四辆，一俟电力恢复后，即可全部复工；后者燃料解决后即可复工。三厂职工在国民党统治时生活困难，每日所得仅够买一斤玉米面。并时有工人被随意解雇。津市解放后工人非常兴奋，生产情绪很高。制配厂工人星期日还查看电线，以便早日恢复生产。
    【新华社天津四日电】天津市公用事业的恢复，由于军管会的正确领导与全体职工的努力，继续获得重要成绩。天津自来水厂与济安自来水公司供水已完全恢复常态。全市各线电车与公共汽车已全部恢复通车。上月二十一日一天，即出驶电车八十二辆，售票六万六千余张。冀北等电力公司已修复全市各主要输电线路，供电是达二百余万基罗瓦特。一切机关及主要工厂、主要市民用电，已得到充分供应。全市一万六千余架电话中，恢复通话者已有万架以上。行政管理局及各支局复业后，邮件日增，上月十八日至二十一日四天内，邮件由五十七件增至六千七百四十三件。平津铁路及津浦路天津至陈官屯段已正式售票通车，旅客极为拥挤。
