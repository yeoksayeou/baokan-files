　　Shenyang Ductile Iron Plant Workers and Technicians Collaborate on Research
  　Successful Ductile Iron Annealing
    [Xinhua News Agency, Shenyang, 11th] Due to the collaborative research of workers and technical personnel at the Shenyang Ductile Iron Plant, the theoretical knowledge from books was combined with the practical experience of labor production, achieving significant success in the annealing of ductile cast iron, reaching the highest standards of the puppet Manchurian era. Ductile cast iron is a necessary material for manufacturing dozens of important parts in locomotives and passenger and freight cars. Its characteristic is that it can withstand high heat without breaking. When first smelted, it is a brittle ordinary iron with a white core, and it must undergo a second annealing process (re-entering the cast parts into the oven, heating to 900 degrees, and then repeatedly raising and lowering the temperature for about 100 hours) to become black-hearted ductile iron. During the puppet Manchurian period, only a few technicians understood this technology, and the annealing work was never 100% successful, only achieving 50% to 90% black-hearted ductile iron each time. In the early days of the Kuomintang's rule in Shenyang, annealing was also tried, but the results were extremely poor, and later it was completely shut down. When Shenyang was liberated this time, the plant still had a large number of semi-finished parts that had been cast but not annealed. At the beginning, the plant's administration did not pay attention to research in a timely manner, and the workers only worked according to past experience, and the results were not good; for example, the fourth furnace obtained 21% black-hearted ductile iron, the fifth furnace obtained 51%, the sixth furnace obtained 64%, and the seventh furnace obtained 45% (note: the rest of the unannealed part can be returned to the furnace for re-annealing). Later, the plant's technical personnel collected some temperature rise and fall charts from the puppet Manchurian period and found some theoretical basis in books, and decided to test the eighth furnace according to the new method, but the result was a complete failure, only obtaining 7.4% black-hearted ductile iron. Therefore, the plant's administration solemnly convened a technical research meeting, in which the director, technical personnel, and experienced veteran workers, a total of 20 people, participated in the discussion, and the workers put forward many concrete opinions based on their own experience. Based on these speeches and comparing them with the theories in the books, after analysis and research, it was unanimously agreed that the workers' experience was very valuable. So, on the 14th of last month, the ninth furnace annealing work was carried out, and the result was amazing. Among the 2,271 parts in the entire furnace, those that were annealed into black-hearted ductile iron accounted for 92%. The Northeast Daily published a short commentary on this, pointing out that the major achievement of ductile iron annealing work proved the importance of combining the rich production experience of workers with the rational knowledge of technicians. This kind of combination should become a regular mutual learning process, not just to solve a certain problem. As long as we learn from each other, learn from each other's strengths, strengthen each other's unity, the factory will be well-run, and continuous victories will be achieved on the production front.

　　沈阳韧铁厂工人技师合作研究结果
  　韧铁退火工作成功
    【新华社沈阳十一日电】沈阳韧铁厂由于工人与技术人员的合作研究，把书本上的理论知识和劳动生产中的实际经验结合了起来，在韧性铸铁的退火工作上获得了重大的成功，达到了伪满时期的最高标准。韧性铸铁是制造机车及客货车中数十种重要零件的必需材料。其特点是耐高热而不断。它在第一次炼好时，为一种白心的极脆的普通铁，必须经过第二次的退火工作（即将铸好的零件重入烘炉，烧至九百度后，再反复升降约一百小时），才能变为黑心韧铁。在伪满时期，仅有少数技师懂得此项技术，且退火工作从来没有百分之百的成功，只能每次退成百分之五十至百分之九十的黑心韧铁。国民党统治沈阳初期，亦曾试办过退火，但成绩极坏，后来完全停工。此次沈阳解放时，该厂尚存有大量已铸好而未退火的半成品的零件。开始时，该厂行政上未及时注意研究，只是由工人们根据以往经验工作，成绩亦不好；如第四炉获百分之二十一的黑心韧铁，第五炉获百分之五十一，第六炉获百分之六十四，第七炉获百分之四十五（按：其余未退好之一部还可以回炉重退）。以后该厂技术人员便收集了一些伪满时期之热度升降表，并在书上找到一些理论根据，决定按新法试验第八炉，但结果非常失败，仅仅获得了百分之七点四的黑心韧铁。因此该厂行政上便郑重地召开了一次技术研究会，厂长、技术人员与有经验的老工友共二十人，都参加讨论，工友们并以自己的经验提出许多具体意见。会上根据这些发言，并和书本上的理论相对照，加以分析研究后，一致认为工人的经验非常宝贵。于是在上月十四日进行了第九炉的退火工作，结果获得了惊人成绩。在全炉二千二百七十一件零件中，退火成为黑心韧铁者，即占百分之九十二。东北日报为此特发表短评，指出从韧铁退火工作的重大成就中，证明了工人的丰富的生产经验与技术人员技术方面的理性知识实行结合的重要。这种结合，应成为经常的互相学习，而不仅仅是为了解决某一问题。只要互相学习，互相取长补短，加强彼此的团结，工厂就会办好，在生产战线上取得不断的胜利。
