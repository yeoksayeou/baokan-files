　　School education work in Central Hebei in 1948 achieved constructive improvements and successes. School education in Central Hebei grew and was established in the environment of the Anti-Japanese Guerrilla War. Therefore, it inherently possessed: irregularities, a lack of teachers, a leadership ideology that favored political education, and a large amount of participation by teachers and students in social and productive activities. In addition, at the beginning of the land reform movement, there was a period of some blind "leftist" actions; but after correction, it was precisely due to the promotion of the land reform movement that many schools further strengthened their ties with the masses. Teachers actively improved teaching and adopted the opinions of the masses, and the children of poor peasants gained the opportunity to attend school. Education work in Central Hebei has gradually improved and developed on this basis.

　　The entire district currently has 28 secondary schools (6 middle schools, 22 normal schools and short-term normal schools), with 5,275 students. Most of these schools were newly established this year, such as the Baoding Joint Middle School established after the liberation of Baoding City, and the 15 newly established county-level short-term normal schools. These schools have gradually shifted from the past irregularities (frequent transfer of students, neglecting cultural learning) to being more standardized. After the Central Hebei and North China Middle School Conference, the schools actively carried out rectification and established teaching systems, achieving initial results.

　　(1) Implemented placement by testing, with the Education Department of the Administrative Office uniformly setting the questions, and conducted tests in five middle schools, dividing students into three-year classes and one-year classes according to their level. Those who did not meet the graduation level of senior primary school were assigned to remedial classes. In order to train more teachers, three-year normal school classes were also set up in the first, second, and fourth middle schools.

　　(2) The schools initially formulated teaching plans, adjusted the proportion of courses and curriculum standards, and established working systems. Teachers organized professional research groups, and the teachers of the Second Middle School also established a system of mutual classroom observation. Students were emphasized to focus on cultural learning, and political classes and social activities were appropriately reduced. After emphasizing cultural learning, the students of the Fourth Middle School made rapid progress in culture. For example, in 41 compositions in the sixth week, there were 148 misspelled words, while in 40 compositions in the tenth week, the number of misspelled words was reduced to 55.

　　(3) Improved the methods of political education, corrected the inappropriate methods of pursuing ideological struggles in past life review meetings, and clarified that students must be educated to transform their ideology.

　　Secondly, in terms of school equipment, each middle school added a set of desks and chairs and a set of bunks for each student based on the existing number of students, established a library, and the First, Fourth, and Fifth Middle Schools also added a set of physics and chemistry equipment. Students in middle schools studied in the classroom at night, equipped with gasoline lamps. Although these facilities are not particularly perfect, they are a great encouragement to students who have endured a long period of arduous revolutionary war life in the liberated areas. Students posted their study plans on their desks or book covers, and students who used to love going home no longer did. The enthusiasm of teachers has also increased significantly. Li Shunan, a natural history teacher at the Fourth Middle School, made plant specimens himself; Li Weiwen, a physics and chemistry teacher, brought out his physics and chemistry equipment for students to experiment with. Teachers at the Fifth Middle School are also making a full human skeleton specimen.

　　Primary school education over the past year has mainly focused on preliminary recovery and rectification work. According to the situation in 43 counties and cities in September, except for Jinnan, Cangxian, and Huanghua, all counties restored the organization of the education section before and after the wheat harvest. During the wheat harvest, teacher symposiums were generally held in various counties. Wuji County resolved the salary issue of all teachers in the county at the symposium; Zhao County assigned education assistants at the meeting; Renqiu assigned some intellectuals in the countryside to participate in education work at the meeting. During the autumn break, 31 counties and cities also held teacher symposiums, and the enthusiasm of primary school teachers gradually increased. At the same time, there has been new development in the number of primary schools restored and established throughout the district. According to statistics from 36 counties and cities before the wheat harvest, there were 6,450 higher and junior primary schools. There were 408,309 students and 9,233 teachers. After the wheat harvest, according to statistics from 48 counties, there were 7,803 higher and junior primary schools, 501,145 students, and 11,413 teachers. Only in Jiahe and Xinle counties, 48 junior primary schools and 8 higher primary schools were added after the wheat harvest, with a total increase of 1,789 students.

　　However, there is still a serious problem in the current national education work in Central Hebei, that is, the quality of teachers is too low and the quantity is also lacking. According to statistics of 6,076 teachers in 33 counties and cities: those with primary school and higher primary school degrees account for 73.7%; those with middle school and normal school degrees, including those who have received middle school normal school training, account for only 26.3%. The situation in Jiaoyang can represent the general counties. Among the 302 teachers in the county, those with junior primary school degrees account for 9.27%, those with higher primary school degrees account for 82%, and those with middle school or normal school degrees account for only 7.8%. In Dacheng, the level of teachers is the lowest: among the 209 teachers in the county, 102 have junior primary school degrees, accounting for 48%, 104 have higher primary school degrees, accounting for 50%, and only 3 have middle school degrees, accounting for 1.5%. In terms of years of service in education work, those with less than one year account for 53%, those with less than two years account for 28%, those with less than three years account for 12%, those with less than four years account for 5%, and only 2 out of 100 have more than five years. Because the cultural level of teachers is still very low, it affects children's enrollment and literacy education. This is a basic issue in the relationship between schools and the masses, and it is also the central issue in restoring and rectifying national education. In addition, according to statistics from 48 counties in November: there are currently 11,413 teachers, and the previous proportional number has been further reduced, which is far from keeping up with the current development of the situation and the needs of the work. Therefore, the Education Department has taken the following three measures: (1) strengthen the study of in-service teachers; (2) train teachers during holidays; (3) establish normal schools to train new teachers. To gradually solve the teacher problem.

　　In this situation, counties generally began to pay attention to the leadership of teachers' study groups, and focused on cultural learning, first of all, to master the primary school textbooks. According to the in-service teacher training in 21 counties and cities during the autumn break, and the teaching experience of the 8th Special District United Normal School, it has been proved that this policy is correct; after many in-service teacher study groups were changed to focus on studying primary school textbooks, the enthusiasm for learning was further improved. According to the lack of teachers, some counties and cities established short-term normal schools. The total number of county-level normal schools has increased from the previous five to twenty throughout the year. In addition, there are two special zone united normal schools, with a total of 2,294 students.

### 冀中一年来的学校教育

　　冀中一年来的学校教育
    一九四八年冀中学校教育工作，曾获得了建设性的改进和成就。冀中学校教育，是在抗日游击战争的环境中生长和建立起来的。因此，它本身也就存在着：不正规化、师资缺乏、领导思想上偏重政治教育、师生参加社会活动和生产活动很多。另外，在土地改革运动开始时，曾一度发生过某些盲目“左”倾行动；但在纠正以后，也正由于土地改革运动的推动，使得很多学校进一步的加强了和群众的联系。教员积极改进教学采纳群众意见，贫苦农民的子女得到了入学的机会。冀中的教育工作，就是在这一基础上逐渐改进和发展建设的。
    全区现有中等学校二十八处（六处中学、二十二处师范和短师学校），学生五千二百七十五名。这些学校大部是本年度增设的，如保定市解放后设立保定联中，并新设了十五处县立短师。这些学校已由过去的不正规化（学员调动频繁，轻视文化学习），逐渐转向比较正规。经过冀中和华北中学会议以后，各校积极进行整顿，树立教学制度，获得了初步成绩。
    （一）实行了测验编班，统一由行署教育处出题，分别在五个中学中进行了测验，按学生程度分为三年制班和一年制班，不够高小毕业程度的，就编到补习班。为了更多的培养师资，还在第一、二、四等三个中学编设了三年制师范班。
    （二）各校初步制定了教学计划，调整了课程比重和课程标准，建立了工作制度。教员们组织了业务研究小组，二中教员们还建立了互相听课的制度。对学生强调着重文化学习，适当减少了政治课和社会活动。四中的学生，强调学习文化以后，文化进步很快，如第六周四十一本作文中，有错白字一百四十八个，到第十周四十本作文中，错白字减到五十五个。
    （三）改进了政治教育的方法，纠正了过去在生活检讨会上的不适当的追思想闹斗争等错误的方法，明确了对学生必须采取教育的方法来改造思想。
    其次，在学校的设备上，各中学根据现有的人数，每人添置了一套桌凳，一套铺板，建立了图书室，一、四、五中还添设了一部理化仪器。各中学学生晚上自习在教室里，设备了汽灯。这些设备虽不是特别完美的，但在解放区长期经受艰苦的革命战争生活的学生来说，却是很大的鼓舞。学生们把自己的学习计划贴在自己的桌子或书皮上，从前爱回家的学生也不回家了。教员的积极性也显着提高。四中博物教员李书南，自己下手制造植物标本；理化教员李慰文将自己的理化仪器拿出来给学生们作试验。五中教师也正在制一全人骨骼的标本。
    一年来的小学教育，主要是作了初步的恢复与整顿工作。据九月份四十三个县市的情况，除津南、沧县、黄骅以外，各县都在麦假前后恢复了教育科的组织。麦假期间，各县普遍召开了教师座谈会。无极县在座谈会上，解决了全县教师的薪金问题；赵县在会议上配备了教育助理员；任邱在会议上分配了某些在乡知识分子参加教育工作。秋假期间，也有三十一个县市召开了教师座谈会，小学教师的积极性也逐渐提高。同时全区恢复和建立小学的数量上，也有了新的发展；据麦假前三十六个县市的统计，有高、初小学六千四百五十处。学生四十万八千三百零九名，教师九千二百三十三名。麦假后据四十八个县的统计，有高、初小学七千八百零三处，学生五十万零一千一百四十五名，教师一万一千四百一十三名、只交河、新乐两县麦假后增加初小四十八处，高小八处，共增学生一千七百八十九名。
    但是，目前冀中的国民教育工作还存在着一个严重的问题，这就是教师的质量太低，数量也缺，据三十三个县市六千零七十六个教师的统计：小学和高小程度的占百分之七十三点七；中学和师范程度的，包括受过中学师范训练的，仅占百分之二十六点三。侥阳的情况能代表一般县份，全县三百零二个教员中，初小程度的占百分之九点二七，高小程度的占百分之八十二，中学师范以上者只占百分之七点八。大城教员程度最低：全县二百零九个教员中，初小程度的一百零二名，占百分之四十八，高小程度的一百零四名，占百分之五十，中学程度的只三名，占百分之一点五。按教育工作在职服务年限说，不满一年者占百分之五十三，不满二年者占百分之二十八，不满三年者占百分之十二，不满四年者占百分之五，五年以上者一百人里面仅有二人。因为教员文化程度还很低，就影响到儿童入学与识字教育。这是学校和群众关系的基本问题，也是恢复和整顿国民教育的中心问题。另外，据十一月四十八个县的统计：现有教师一万一千四百十三名，较前比例数愈益缩小，这更远赶不上目前形势发展和工作的需要。因此，教育处曾采取了以下三个办法：（一）加强在职教师学习；（二）假期训练教师；（三）建立师范，培养新师资。以逐步解决师资问题。
    在这种情况下，各县一般的开始注意对教师学习小组的领导，并以学习文化为主，首先要精通小学课本。据秋假期间，二十一个县市在职教师轮训中，和八专联师的教导经验中，都证明这一方针是正确的；许多在职教师学习小组，改为研究小学课本为主以后，学习情绪更提高了。根据教师缺乏的情况，部分县市成立了短期师范，计全年由过去五处县立师范现已增加到二十处。另外，还有专区联师两处，共学员二千二百九十四名。
