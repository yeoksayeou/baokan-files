　　Six Large Nets Launched
    ——Fishermen in Shantangzi Village Organize Fishing Production
    Bai Hua
    Tangzi Village is located in the eastern part of the first district of ＠ Mountain, nestled against the mountain and beside the lake (East Ping Lake). Villagers have traditionally relied on fishing and planting aquatic plants to sustain their lives. In 1938, the Yellow River burst its banks, and the lake dried up. People began to plant wheat, and the fishing nets and boats were almost completely destroyed. After the Yellow River returned to its course, people resumed their lives in the water area, but the loss of fishing tools added many difficulties to people's production. Currently, the entire village has only six damaged large nets (Chuanling nets). After the leadership actively called for and mobilized production mutual aid last winter, and the bank provided some loan support, the six large nets were completely repaired and organized for fishing.
    Chen Yuncheng, Zhang Fuzhu, and twenty others formed a group, using a large net called Yilong Large Net. When cooperating to repair the net, each person contributed seven sheng of wheat, totaling one shi and four dou, and borrowed another two shi and five dou. The net is now worth forty-two shi of wheat. From November 28th to December 24th last year, the group earned 34,100 yuan (People's Currency) from fish sales in twenty-six days, with each person receiving 1,705 yuan. After deducting the expenses of the fishermen, the net profit was 2,354 jin of red grain. Liu Jiahu, Du Lianzhen, Zhao Qingchang, Zhao Qinghai, Du Shenglin, and others also formed fishing groups to engage in fishing. In addition, each large net could support three fish vendors and a dozen children picking up fish. The profit earned by each fish vendor was equivalent to the income of each member of the large net group.
    In total, the income from fishing with six large nets in twenty-five to twenty-six days was equivalent to 29,470 jin of red grain. After deducting 11,084 jin for consumption, the remaining 18,386 jin. The seventeen small fish vendors earned a total of 2,480 jin, with a surplus of 1,120 jin after deducting consumption. In terms of numbers, a total of 187 people directly participated in the labor surrounding the six large nets.
    Due to the real benefits obtained from fishing this winter, the fishermen's enthusiasm for production is extremely high. They have all realized that only by organizing fishing and planting cattails can the lives of people in the water area be solved. Therefore, the fishermen have further preliminarily planned the production:
    (1) After the ice thaws in early spring, large nets will no longer be effective. The labor force between the ages of twenty and forty will freely combine and switch to pulling seine nets and cutting fishing weirs (a type of fishing method). The County Industry and Commerce Bureau is helping them purchase cowhide to sew "leather @," and the semi-labor force will switch to pulling shrimp, and those with boats will pull sleeve nets.
    (2) Protect water caltrop and restore last year's water caltrop protection committee. The village will select one representative to participate in the district committee.
    (3) Each household will plant cattails, which can solve the problem of firewood and cattle feed. It is planned to plant in groups, and the County Production Committee will help solve the seedling difficulties.
    (4) Women will spin and weave nets, which will greatly increase the number of new fishing nets.
    In terms of conservation, the County Production Committee has also paid special attention to conducting conservation education. When not fishing, the fishermen only drink gruel twice a day. They plan to save food to add fishing gear.

### 六架大网下水了——＠山堂子村渔民组织捕鱼生产

　　六架大网下水了
    ——＠山堂子村渔民组织捕鱼生产
    白桦
    堂子村位于＠山一区的东部，依山傍湖（东平湖），村民们一向靠捕鱼和种植水生植物维持生活。一九三八年黄河南决，湖水涸竭，人们又开始种麦，网罟船只已经消毁殆尽。黄河归故后，人们又开始了水区生活，但由于捕鱼工具的损失，增加了人民生产中很多困难。现全村共落了六架破大网（穿凌网）。经过去冬领导上积极号召动员生产互助，银行并予以一部贷款扶持后，六架大网才全部修补起来，组织捕鱼。
    陈云诚、张复柱等二十人组成一组，用一个大网，该网名曰义隆大网，合作修补时，每人集股麦子七升，共集一石四斗，又贷二石五斗。现该网价值四十二石麦。该组自去年十一月二十八日到十二月二十四日共二十六天内，共得鱼钱（人民币）三万四千一百元，每人分得鱼钱一千七百零五元。除捕鱼劳动者的消耗外，净存红粮二千三百五十四斤。还有刘家户、杜连振、赵庆常、赵庆海、杜盛林等都成立了捕鱼组，进行捕鱼，此外，每架大网还可养鱼贩三个，拾鱼的小孩十几个。每个鱼贩所得利润相当于大网上每一组员的所得。
    总计六架大网在二十五六天的时间内捕鱼收入，折合红粮为二万九千四百七十斤，除食用一万一千零八十四斤外，下余一万八千三百八十六斤。小鱼贩十七个共收入二千四百八十斤，除食用下余一千一百二十斤。在人数上来说，围绕六架大网总计有一百八十七人参加了直接劳动。
    由于今冬捕鱼获得了实利，目前渔民生产情绪极高，均已认识只有组织捕鱼，及种植蒲茳，才是解决水区人民生活的道路。故渔民们又进一步对生产作了初步计划的酝酿：
    （一）立春解冻冰开之后，大网就不行了。二十岁至四十岁的劳动力即自由结合转向拉绠网，砍罩（一种捕鱼方式），县工商局正帮助其购买牛皮缝制“皮＠”，半劳力者即转向拉虾，有船者拉袖网。
    （二）保护菱角，恢复去年的护菱委员会，村里选派代表一人参加区的委员会。
    （三）各户栽种蒲茳，可解决烧柴及牛的饲料，准备以组为单位栽种，县生产委员会帮助解决苗子困难。
    （四）妇女纺织结网，这对增设新的鱼网作用很大。
    节约方面，县生产委员会也特别注意进行了节约教育。渔民们在不捕鱼时，每人只喝两顿糊涂。打算节省粮食，好增添渔具。
