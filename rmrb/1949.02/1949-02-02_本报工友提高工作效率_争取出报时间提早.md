　　Our Newspaper Workers Improve Work Efficiency
  　Strive for Earlier Publication Time
    [Our Newspaper] In order to advance the publication time and meet the requirements of the victorious situation, the typesetting section of this newspaper held section meetings and meetings of various production teams to review that each team did not pay enough attention to the publication time and that there were problems of delaying time and uneven distribution of manpower among the production teams. After review and adjustment, the time for each page to produce master proofs was advanced by one hour. Comrades on each page are very active in their work. For example, the comrades in charge of changing news on the first page at night do not mind the trouble, and they still get up early as usual and continue to work during the day. In the past, the stereotyping section took two and a half hours to cast one newspaper page (the entire process of casting, proofing, and repairing the plate), and the entire process of casting four newspaper pages took eight or nine hours. After the adjustment of leadership and technical personnel, and with the establishment of an inspection system by the typesetting section, the newspaper pages are more neatly assembled than before. Now, the entire process of casting one page only takes one and a half hours, and the entire process of four newspaper pages can be completed in five hours. There are also fewer damaged pages. In the past, the delivery section delivered pages by bicycle during the day, and it took four hours to travel seventy li. Now, in order to advance the newspaper publication time, it has been changed to riding a bicycle at night, and it only takes three hours to reach the destination. At night, holding a lantern in one hand and gripping the handlebars in the other, they travel seventy li without rest, delivering the pages in one go. In the production team, the team leader grasps the leadership tightly, takes the lead in the work, and inspires everyone's enthusiasm. For example, after the second production team finished typesetting the manuscript, Comrade Fan Shoutian automatically shouted the slogan: "Three boxes of type per person, it's over when it's divided!" Everyone was energized, and everyone finished dividing in an hour and a half. The encouragement of the victorious situation made everyone's work enthusiasm high, coupled with the improvement of leadership and the adjustment of manpower, so that the entire publication process can be advanced one step.

　　本报工友提高工作效率
  　争取出报时间提早
    【本报讯】为了提前出版时间，适应胜利形势的要求，本报排字股召开股务及各生产小组会议，检讨出各组对出版时间抓的不够紧，有拖延时间和生产小组人力强弱分配不均之毛病。经检讨调整后，各版出大样时间都提前一小时。各版同志在工作上都很积极，如：一版黑夜动版换消息，工作同志都不嫌麻烦，并且还同平时一样起的早，白天还照旧工作。浇版股在过去打一块报版（浇、打、修版全部过程）二小时半，四块报版全部过程需八、九小时。经领导及技术人材的调整，又加上排字股建立起检查制度，报版较前拚的规矩。现打一块版全部过程只需一小时半，四块报版五小时就可全部完成。坏版也少了。送版股在过去白天骑自行车送版，七十里路得走四个钟头，现为提前报纸出版时间，改成夜间骑车走，且三个钟头就到了目的地。夜间一手打着电灯，一手捉着车子把，沿途七十里路不休息，一鼓劲送到。在生产小组里组长抓紧领导，带头工作，启发起大家的积极性。如：第二生产小组排完稿子后，范守田同志自动的喊出：“每人三盒字，分完就没事”的口号。大家就鼓起劲来，一个半钟头每人都分完了。胜利形势的鼓舞，使大家工作热情高涨，再加领导上的改进人力的调整，使整个出版过程能提前一步。
