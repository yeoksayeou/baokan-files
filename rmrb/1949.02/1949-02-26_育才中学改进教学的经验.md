Yucai Middle School, in implementing the guidelines of the Secondary Education Conference and carrying out formal teaching, discovered some new problems: many students felt that their studies were "busy" and "pressured," and some even experienced headaches and decreased appetite. After research and review by the teaching and instructional departments, as well as group leaders, and studying the documents of the Secondary Education Conference, it was believed that the main reasons for being "busy" were as follows:

	I. Teachers did not start from the students' ability to accept knowledge, and always wanted to quickly impart their own methods to the students. Therefore, the content was too much and the amount was too heavy. In addition to textbooks, many supplementary materials were added. Students couldn't finish taking notes in class and had to rush to do them outside of class.
	II. Many teachers lacked teaching experience, and although they worked actively, they could not achieve the expected results, and students found it very difficult to learn. For example, some teachers told students: "As long as you memorize (recite the textbook) well, there will be no problem."
	III. Teachers of all subjects wanted students to learn their subject well, and each assigned homework outside of class without mutual coordination. When several subjects were combined, students couldn't handle it and couldn't cope.

After a meeting of teachers, the unity of teaching plan and teaching effect was clarified. First, improvements were made in the content and focus of the teaching materials. The teaching materials were selected and the teaching progress was set according to the students' ability to accept, especially according to the average level of students in the class. When lecturing, the language was clear and unambiguous. Problems that could not be solved in class were taken back and carefully considered and studied before making serious, responsible, and affirmative answers.

Secondly, the class teachers and subject teachers maintained frequent contact to study and grasp the teaching situation in the class, study the teaching progress and the students' understanding, as well as homework assignments, etc., overcoming the shortcomings of rushing and squeezing each other in the past, and being tight and loose at times. The guidance of students' learning was strengthened, stimulating students' interest in self-study, pointing out the scope of self-study, so that students could focus and center on digesting what they had learned in class. The class teacher also helped students to make study plans, including both formal classes and extracurricular learning. If a subject was weak, remedial measures were formulated. In addition, efforts were made to enable students to exchange learning experiences. Xiao Lin, a student in Girls' Class One, wrote an article on the blackboard newspaper entitled "Experience in Learning Chemistry," which not only improved the learning methods in the class, but other classes quickly absorbed this experience.

After the improvement of teaching methods, it was generally felt that the class was easier to remember, the homework was completed faster, and there was time to read extracurricular books. The phenomena of being "busy" and "tired" were gradually overcome, and cultural and recreational activities became generally active. The most obvious was that the number of sick students was reduced from 390 students to only 0.8% to 1%, and the number of people borrowing books from the library increased to 98.2% of all students.

Due to the improvements in all aspects, the teaching effect has been improved. Looking at a girls' class in the first semester of the first year, out of 30 students in the class, after lecturing, 77% fully understood the Chinese language class, and 23% partially understood; 77% fully understood arithmetic, and 23% partially understood; 60% fully understood the political class, and 40% partially understood; 80% fully understood geography, and 20% partially understood.

　　育才中学改进教学的经验
    育才中学在执行中等教育会议方针，实行正规教学的过程中，发现了一些新的问题：很多学生感到功课“忙”、“压的紧”，有些学生甚至发生头痛、饭量减少等现象。经过教导、教学各部门及小组长等会议的研究、检讨和对中等教育会议文件的学习后，认为“忙”的主要原因有下列几点：
    一、教员没有从学生接受的能力出发，总想把自己的一套很快的贯输给学生，因而内容多、份量重，除了课本外，还增加了很多补充材料；课堂里抄不完笔记，堆到外课赶。
    二、不少教员缺乏教学经验，虽然积极努力，也不能收到预期效果，学生学起来很费力气。如有的教员和学生说：“你们只要好好的背（背书），就没有问题。”
    三、各科教员都愿意学生把本门功课学好，课外各自留作业，没有互相配合，几门课集合起来，学生便吃不消，无法应付。
    经教员会议后，明确了教学计划与教学效果的统一性。首先在教材内容和重点上有了改进，根据学生的接受能力，特别是根据班上中等水平的学生出发来选择教材，订出教学进度。讲课时言词明确，不采取含糊态度，堂上解决不了的问题带回去，经慎重考虑与研究后，做出认真、负责、肯定的解答。
    其次，级任教员与任课教员经常联系，研究和掌握班上的教学情况，研究教学进度以及学生的了解程度和留作业等问题，克服了过去互相赶、互相挤，时松时紧的缺点；加强了学生的学习指导，启发学生自习兴趣，指出自习的范围，使学生有重点、有中心的去消化课堂上所学的东西。级任教员并帮助学生订学习计划，将正课与课外学习都包括进去，哪门功课差，就订出辅助的办法。此外，又设法使学生交流学习经验。女一班学生肖林，在墙报上写了一篇“学化学的经验”，不但改进了班上的学习方法，其他班也很快吸取了这一经验。
    教学方法改进后，普遍的觉得上课记得清，作业完得快，还有时间看课外书，“忙”“累”现象逐渐被克服了，文化娱乐的活动普遍活跃起来。最明显的，便是病号减到三百九十名学生中只有百分之点八到百分之一，图书馆借书人数增加到全校学生的百分之九十八点二。
    由于各方面的改进，教学效果提高了。从一年一期的一个女生班来看，全班三十个人，经讲授后国文课全懂的占百分之七十七，部分懂的占百分之二十三；算术全懂的百分之七十七，部分懂的百分之二十三；政治课全懂的百分之六十，部分懂的百分之四十；地理全懂的百分之八十，部分懂的百分之二十。
