　　Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, February 5th: TASS reports: According to a recent report by "Chronicle" reporter Lumber, after traveling throughout Malaya, his impression is that Britain's situation has deteriorated further in the past few weeks. He wrote: The rebel army (referring to the People's Guerrillas) is highly efficient in combat. Their military intelligence is extremely well-informed. They are attacking highways, railways, and mines more frequently than ever before. Every European wants to leave or retire as soon as possible, and the newly arrived managers from abroad are far from sufficient to replace those who are leaving. The reporter also stated: When he pointed out that the views of the rubber plantation owners differed from those of the British military commander in Malaya, Boucher, Boucher angrily complained: "As long as the people continue to help the rebels with food and intelligence, and as long as representatives of all communities do not cooperate with the government, this state of emergency will continue as before, and no amount of troops will help."

　　英帝在马来亚处境更加恶化
    【新华社陕北五日电】塔斯社讯：据英国“纪事报”记者伦伯尔最近报导，他在马来亚各地旅行之后，所得印象是：英国的处境过去数星期是更加恶化了。他写道：叛军（指人民游击队）作战效率甚高。他们的军事情报极为灵通。他们比以往任何时期更加频繁地袭击公路、铁路和矿山。每一个欧洲人都想赶快离去或者退休，从国外新来的经理，毫不足以补充那些离开的人。该记者又称：当他指出橡园主对形势的看法与马来亚英军司今鲍奇尔不同时，鲍氏便冒火地抱怨说：“只要人民一天还以粮食与情报帮助叛军，只要一切社团的代表一天还不与政府合作，这种紧急状态就会和以前一样继续下去，随便多少军队也无济于事。”
