　　In the National Liberation Struggle
  　Vietnamese Women Play a Significant Role
    Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 16th: TASS Moscow, 12th: The Soviet Women's Anti-Fascist Committee recently received a letter from Vietnam describing the important role played by Vietnamese women in the national liberation struggle. The letter stated in brief: In the vast liberated areas, Vietnamese women have replaced the men who joined the army to defend the fruits of democracy, working in factories, workshops, farms, schools, and hospitals. Many women have joined the front-line first aid stations, and some have even directly participated in the war. Under the leadership of the Vietnam National Democratic Women's Union, which has more than one million members, Vietnamese women actively participate in movements to support the front lines, help the elderly and children of military families, improve labor productivity, and increase industrial and agricultural output. In every village where democratic army troops are stationed, rural women voluntarily cook and mend clothes for the soldiers. In many provinces, "Associations of Mothers of Active Servicemen" have been established, expressing the utmost concern for the wounded. As a result of increased production, the troops' meals have been significantly improved. Women are carrying out the work of repairing old dikes and building new ones, saving millions of acres of land from flooding.
    In guerrilla areas and villages close to the front lines, many women's groups have been formed to rescue women and children who have fallen into enemy hands. In enemy-occupied areas, women maintain close contact with the guerrillas, and they do everything in their power to help the guerrillas.

　　在民族解放斗争中
  　越南妇女起重大作用
    【新华社陕北十六日电】塔斯社莫斯科十二日讯：苏联妇女反法西斯委员会最近接到越南来信，描述越南妇女在民族解放斗争当中所起的重要作用。该信略称：在广大的解放区中，越南妇女代替了参军保卫民主果实的男子，在工厂、作坊、农田、学校、医院工作。许多妇女参加了前线急救站工作，有的并直接参战。在拥有百万以上会员的越南全国民主妇女联盟的领导下，越南妇女踊跃参加支援前线、帮助军人家属的老年和儿童、提高劳动生产率与增加工农业产量的运动。在每个驻有民主军部队的村庄里，农村妇女自动给兵士作饭补衣服。在许多省份里，“现役军人母亲协会”已成立起来，对伤员表示了最大的关切。由于生产增加的结果，部队的伙食已显著改善。妇女们进行修复旧堤和建造新堤的工作，使成百万亩田地得免于水灾。
    在游击区与接近前线的村庄里，已组成了许多妇女团体，救回了落入敌人手里的妇女儿童。在敌占区内，妇女与游击队建立密切联系，她们尽一切力量帮助游击队。
