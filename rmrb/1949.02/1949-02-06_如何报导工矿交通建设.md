How to Report on Industrial, Mining, and Transportation Construction

Recently, reports on industrial and mining production and transportation construction have been increasing in various regions, and they all pay attention to reflecting the working class's labor enthusiasm and positive role in these production and construction efforts, which is excellent and must be maintained and promoted in the future. However, at the same time, we have found that many of these submissions quite commonly exhibit a tendency to simply pursue superficial and formal figures, lacking specific and vivid reports on the true situation. Some of these figures cannot explain anything at all and therefore have no practical significance; some cannot withstand any scrutiny and reveal flaws upon closer examination; and some are obviously empty, false, or even conceal content contrary to the figures themselves. We are not saying that all the figures in the submissions from various regions are unreliable, but that the methods of generating and calculating some of these figures are unscientific, and some are indeed unfounded.

For example, we recently received an article on "The Production Increase Competition at the Shijiazhuang Forward Factory," which contained several incomprehensible points. For instance, it stated, "In early November of last year, after the People's Liberation Army shattered the Kuomintang army's conspiracy to sneak attack Shijiazhuang, all the workers and staff of the Forward Factory, with superhuman energy, completed the factory's resumption and construction plan for two weeks within thirty-two hours." We know that the production increase competition at the Forward Factory did demonstrate the working class's high level of labor enthusiasm and political consciousness, and it achieved great results. However, the original article neither explained how the "two-week plan" was calculated, whether it was assessed, nor why it could be completed in thirty-two hours. Therefore, when people read it, they will either think the plan was inaccurate or that the report was exaggerated. Another example is: "The casting worker Zhao Qingyun, in his new steel melting method, can avoid using a steelmaking tank, and the output increased from 30 jin per batch when using a steelmaking tank to 600 to 800 jin per batch." It did not explain how this new method could produce such high results, and it is doubtful whether this extremely large difference in figures has been accurately calculated. Another example is the report on Tangshan's situation in the Jidong Daily on January 15, which stated: "After liberation, the workers of Tangshan's industrial, mining, railway, and electric power industries actively produced to support the People's Liberation Army in combat. ... The coal production of each mine at the ×× coal mine increased by 59 percent compared to before liberation as of January 3." According to the information we have, the mine's coal has no outlet, and the company authorities have not paid the workers' wages for many days. Under these circumstances, how could the mine have increased production by 59 percent? Furthermore, many reports on public enterprises often claim that a certain company or factory made a profit of a certain amount in a certain year, and the workers' production volume increased by many times, with each worker earning a certain amount of money for the country per year. However, it does not explain how the workers' production volume increased, and when the so-called increase by many times is compared to which year and month; in addition to the workers' labor enthusiasm, whether there are other factors. At the same time, when calculating the profit, it does not take into account changes in prices and currency values, as well as the consumption of fixed capital.

Such boastful reports, even if the reporter's intention is to be perfect, will have very bad effects if published. It will create a bad atmosphere in our own economic work front, which is to be impractical, pursue formalism, and indulge in the game of false figures. Some enterprise managers of poor quality may even use newspaper propaganda to deceive their superiors and the masses, covering up their own bureaucracy and embezzlement. For the working-class brothers in newly liberated cities, this kind of propaganda will not only fail to correctly raise their class consciousness and labor enthusiasm, but will also make some people think that the Communist Party and the democratic government do not understand industry and science. In this way, some ideologically backward elements will feel that there is an opportunity to take advantage of, and they will use their talents and energy in the wrong direction. As for the general readers outside, they will think that our reports are too dishonest and unreasonable, thereby questioning other propaganda and damaging the credibility of our Party's propaganda work.

Why are these untrue problems particularly occurring in reports on industrial, mining, and transportation construction recently? This is primarily because many of our reporters do not understand economics, industry, or the workers' movement, lacking knowledge in this field, and therefore cannot effectively investigate and identify many figures. However, a lack of knowledge can be compensated for and is not enough to completely deprive us of our ability to judge to the point where we have to publish untrue news indiscriminately. The problem lies in the fact that some editors, reporters, and correspondents do not have a serious and rigorous work attitude and have not truly delved into reality to conduct investigations, but instead rely on hearsay and parrot others. They publish whatever materials others give them without seriously, meticulously, analyzing, and discriminating them. On the other hand, many of our editors, reporters, and correspondents attempt to meet the needs of news agencies and newspapers for news about industrial production and workers' labor conditions (this requirement of news agencies and newspapers is completely justified, and today's liberated areas indeed have much that should be introduced; we are still not reporting enough). However, they do not know how to collect valuable materials and conduct concrete and vivid reports. So, they diligently engage in the arrangement and stacking of figures, without asking whether these figures are reliable and meaningful.

Naturally, many problems caused by figures cannot be completely solved by just a few reporters or news propaganda departments but must be improved through the joint efforts of the entire Party, especially the economic work departments, to establish accurate supervision and accounting systems. However, based on the above situation, our news work can and should start by: 1. Systematically specializing editors and reporters. First, establish economic reporters and editors who specialize in economic news writing and research. They must study economic theory, research knowledge of industrial and mining enterprises, and be familiar with local production construction and workers' movement situations, so that they have higher knowledge and ability in this area than ordinary people and can report on economic news with the qualifications of an expert. In the beginning, do not seek too many of these editors and reporters, just be able to have one or two comrades with appropriate standards and conditions to fill the role. 2. Grasp every concrete example and repeatedly educate our reporters and editors to work with a responsible and cautious attitude. Any material, thing, or problem that comes into our hands should be analyzed, researched, and judged using our own thinking, to see if it is accurate, to understand its content and meaning, and not to let it go easily and perfunctorily. There are many things in the world that we do not understand. If we do not understand something, we should not be ashamed to ask, but rather ask those below us, and not pretend to know when we do not, and report things that we do not understand. Especially those figures, they all contain complex and rich content, we must not underestimate them, we must double-check them before publishing. 3. Everyone must understand: the purpose of quoting figures should be to explain the problem, not to scare people. Therefore, it is not necessary to pile up a large pile of figures, nor does it matter if the level of the figure is increased, increased to the point of being "amazing." An eight-digit number and a two-digit number, if not related to other things, have no meaning in themselves. If a quoted figure is to have an effect, the historical factors, social environment, all kinds of favorable or unfavorable conditions, as well as the tortuous and concrete process of the birth of this figure should be explained, and this figure should also be compared with the figures of other places, other factories, other times, and other people. This is also a matter of the connection between the individual and the general, the part and the whole. In our news reports, there are often two kinds of problems: either introducing general abstract situations without concrete content and facts; or listing a large pile of phenomena and examples, but these phenomena and examples are not related to any other aspects, and therefore cannot explain the whole picture of things. Reporting on industrial, mining, and transportation construction, quoting specific figures to reflect the situation and explain the problem is completely necessary, but if a large pile of figures is simply quoted without comparison and analysis, and even the figures themselves are unreliable, then it cannot reflect the situation and explain the problem, and it is only harmful and useless to readers or practical work.

　　如何报导工矿交通建设
    最近各地对于工矿生产和交通建设的报导日渐增加，而且都很注意反映工人阶级在这些生产建设中的劳动热忱和积极作用，这是很好的，今后必须继续保持与发扬。但同时我们发现许多这类稿件中，相当普遍的存在着一种单纯追求表面的、形式的数目字，而缺乏对于真实情况的具体的、生动的报导。这些数目字，有的根本不能说明任何问题，因而也就没有实际意义，有的经不起任何推敲，一推敲便露出破绽，有的则一望而知是空头的、虚假的、甚至掩藏着与数目字本身相反的内容。我们并不是说各地来稿中的所有数目字都不可靠，而是有些数目字的产生方法和计算方法就不科学，也有些则的确是没有根据的。
    例如本报最近收到一篇“石家庄前进工厂的增产竞赛”的稿件，里面就有好几处令人难以理解，如说“去年十一月初，人民解放军粉碎了国民党军偷袭石家庄的阴谋后，前进工厂全体职工以超人的精力，在三十二小时内完成两星期的复工建厂计划。”我们知道前进工厂的增产竞赛的确表现了工人阶级的高度劳动热情与政治觉悟，是获得了很大成绩的，但三十二小时如何完成十四天的计划，原稿既未说明“两星期计划”是如何计算的，是否经过考核，也未说明三十二小时能够完成的原因，那末叫人一看，不是说计划不精确，便是报导的夸大。又如说：“铸工所工人赵庆云，在他研究的新的溶钢法中，可以不使用化钢罐，而产量却由采用化钢罐时的每次三十斤，提高到每次六百至八百斤，”并未说明，这种新办法如何能产生这样高的效果，这种极大悬殊的数字是否经过精确计算，是值得怀疑的。又如冀东一月十五日报导唐山情况称：“解放后的唐山工矿铁路电力工人积极生产，支援解放军作战。………××煤矿各矿场产煤量，至一月三日比解放前已提高百分之五十九。”据我们知道的材料，该矿存煤没有出路，公司当局对工人好多天未发工资。在这种情形下，该矿又何能增产百分之五十九呢？此外如许多关于公营企业的报导，往往宣称某公司、某工厂某年获利若干，工人生产量提高了多少倍，平均每个工人一年替国家赚了多少钱，但它并未说明工人生产量是如何提高的，所谓提高多少倍是与哪年哪月比较的，这种提高除了工人的劳动情绪以外，是否还有其他因素；同时，它在计算赚钱的时候，却又未把物价和币值的变动以及固定资本的消耗等等计算在内。
    这种虚张声势的报导，尽管记者的用意是尽善尽美的，但如果发表出去，其效果则是十分恶劣的。这会在我们自己经济工作阵营中，造成一种不良风气，就是不务实际，追求形式，在虚伪的数目字的游戏中自我陶醉，某些品质不好的企业管理人，甚至会利用报纸的宣传来欺骗上级和群众，掩护他自己的官僚主义和营私舞弊。对于新解放城市的工人兄弟，这种宣传不但不能正确地提高他们的阶级觉悟和劳动热忱，而且会使有些人认为共产党和民主政府不懂工业，不懂科学；这样某些思想上落后的分子就会感到有机可乘，而把他们的才智心力发挥到不正当的道路上去。至于外界一般读者，则会认为我们的报导太不老实，不近人情，从而对其他宣传也发生怀疑，就使我们党的宣传工作的信用受到损害。
    为什么最近特别在工、矿、交通建设的报导中发生这些不真实的毛病？这首先是由于我们的许多记者不懂经济，不懂工业，也不懂工人运动，缺乏这一门知识，因而不能很好的考察和识别许多数目字。但知识的缺乏是可以弥补的，也还不至使我们完全丧失判断能力到了那种非随便发表不真实新闻不可的程度。问题还在于有些编辑、记者和通讯员，工作态度不够认真，不够严肃，没有真正深入实际，进行探访，而是道听途说，人云亦云。别人交给什么材料便照样发出，而不去认真地、精细地加以推敲、分析和鉴别。另一方面、我们的许多编辑、记者和通讯员企图满足通讯社和报纸关于工业生产和工人劳动情况的新闻的需要（通讯社和报纸的这种要求是完全应该的，而且今天解放区在这方面的确有许多应该介绍，我们正还报导得十分不够）。但他们却不知道如何采集有价值的材料，进行具体的、生动的报导。那样他们便去孜孜地从事于数目字的排列和堆砌，而不问这些数目字是否可靠和有意义。
    自然由数目字而引起的许多问题，决不是仅仅几个记者或新闻宣传部门所能完全解决，而必须全党尤其是经济工作部门共同努力建立精确的监督和核算制度来求得改进。但是，根据上述情况，我们新闻工作方面，已经可以而且应该先做起来：一、必须有计划的使编辑、记者逐渐专门化。首先设立经济记者和编辑，专门从事经济新闻的采写和研究。他们必须学习经济理论，研究工、矿企业的知识，熟习当地生产建设和工人运动的情况，使自己在这一方面有比普通人为高的知识和能力，能够以一个行家的资格进行经济新闻的报导。这种编辑记者在初不求其多，能够有一二个具有适当水准和条件的同志充任即可。二、必须抓紧每一具体事例反复的教育我们的记者和编辑，以认真负责和谨慎严肃的态度来做工作，任何材料、事物、问题到了我们的手里，就应该运用自己的思考，加以分析、研究和判断，考察它是否准确，了解其中的内容和含义，不要轻易放过，潦草塞责。现在天下不懂得的事情多得很，自己不懂的，便应不耻下问，而不要强不知以为知，把自己都弄不清的事情报导出去。尤其是那些数目字，它们都包含复杂的丰富的内容，我们不要小看它们，一定要对校清楚，然后发表。三、必须使大家懂得：引用数目字的目的，应该在于说明问题，而不是为了吓唬人。因此，不必把数目字堆得一大堆，也不在乎把数字的级位加大，加大到所谓“惊人”的程度，一个八位数的数字和一个两位数的数字，如果不与其他事物联系，其本身的差别是没有意义的。要是一个被引用的数目字发生作用，便应把这个数目字诞生的历史因素、社会环境、诸般有利或不利条件以及曲折的具体的经过，而且还要把这个数目字和其他地方、其他工厂、其他时间、其他人物的数目字比较。这也就是个别和一般、部分和整体的联系问题。在我们的新闻报导上，常常有这两方面的弊病：或者是介绍一般的抽象的状况，而缺乏具体内容和事实；或者是罗列一大堆现象和事例，而这些现象和事例并不与其他任何方面发生联系，因而不能说明事物的全貌。报导工矿交通建设，引用具体数字来反映情况，说明问题，是完全必要的，但如果单纯引用一大堆数目字而不加比较和分析，甚至数字本身又是不可靠的，那就不能反映情况、说明问题，对于读者或实际工作只是有害而无益。
