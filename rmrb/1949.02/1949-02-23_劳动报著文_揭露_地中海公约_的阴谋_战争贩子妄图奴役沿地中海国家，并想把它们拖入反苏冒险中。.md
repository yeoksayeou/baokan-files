Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, February 21st dispatch: TASS Moscow, February 16th: The Labor Daily published an article by Zvyagin, entitled "Mediterranean Pact - A Tool of U.S. Imperialism." The main points of the article are as follows:

	The shift of American attention to the Mediterranean is no accident, because Wall Street's plan to seek world hegemony has assigned a special role to this region. Everyone knows that the eastern shore of the Mediterranean is full of the smell of oil. According to very conservative estimates, the oil reserves in the Near East and Middle Eastern countries along the Mediterranean coast amount to 5.5 billion tons. Now, American monopoly capital is making every effort to include the oil reserves in this area. However, the Mediterranean's attraction to overseas expansionists is not only due to its natural wealth; military strategic considerations are equally important. American and British strategists are currently engaged in drafting plans to prepare for aggression against the Soviet Union and the New Democratic countries. They are building naval and air force bases on the territories of countries neighboring the Soviet Union and the People's Democratic countries, and various supplies of American and British weapons are being shipped there.

	In the West, they do not conceal their frantic activities in dragging Mediterranean countries into a military-political group under the wings of the United States. The United States is not only infiltrating Iran economically, but also militarily. Iran is now being dragged into the so-called "Mediterranean Pact." The status of the Arab League countries is slightly different. The United States did not previously have military bases in these countries, and the United States did not recognize Transjordan. However, there are now many signs that, in connection with the proposed "Mediterranean Pact," the United States has launched a diplomatic offensive in these countries. In terms of steps, the American expansionists are still using the methods familiar to the people of Western Europe here, namely the gold of economic "aid" followed by the shackles of military and political conventions.

	Italy is a particularly troubling factor for the initiators of the "Atlantic Pact." Due to the good organization and unity of the democratic forces, the Italian ruling group has to consider the attitude of the broad masses of the people, who do not want their country to be involved in any military group. This situation forces Gasperi and his Washington masters to adopt various methods to conceal Italy's participation in the proposed North Atlantic and Mediterranean groups. As for the direct accession of fascist Spain to the Western alliance or the North Atlantic alliance, it is considered not yet the time, because the Franco regime is condemned by world opinion. Therefore, they propose to allow Spain to temporarily participate in the "regional" Mediterranean Pact.

	Like other creations of American diplomacy, the Mediterranean Pact is prepared to be used as a tool for international reactionary forces in the Mediterranean to suppress the democratic and liberation movements in the Mediterranean countries, enslave these countries, and drag them into anti-Soviet adventures that are beneficial to Wall Street merchants. This is the essence of the Mediterranean Pact planned by the warmongers. However, the determination of the people of the Mediterranean countries to oppose being dragged into any adventurous groups and alliances is growing, and the democratic forces in the Mediterranean countries are strong enough to expose and shatter the secret conspiracies of the warmongers.

  　揭露“地中海公约”的阴谋
    战争贩子妄图奴役沿地中海国家，并想把它们拖入反苏冒险中。
    【新华社陕北二十一日电】塔斯社莫斯科十六日讯：劳动报刊载兹维雅金的专文，题为“地中海公约——美帝国主义的工具”。该文大要如下：
    美国注意力之转移到地中海来，并非偶然，因为华尔街寻求世界霸权的计划，已给这一地区指派了特别的作用。大家知道，在地中海东岸，是充满着石油味道的。依据极不过分的估计，在地中海沿岸近东与中东国家的石油储藏量达五十五亿吨。现在，美国独占资本正在尽一切努力以囊括这一地区的油藏。但是，地中海之所以引起海外扩张主义者的注意，还不只是起因于它的自然财富，军事的战略考虑也具有同样的重要性。美英战略家们目前正在从事于起草准备侵略苏联和新民主国家的计划。他们正在邻近苏联及人民民主国家的各国领土上建筑海空军基地，美英武器的各种供给也正在运往那里。
    在西方，他们并不掩盖正在把地中海国家拉入一个在美国卵翼下的军事政治集团的各种狂热活动。美国不仅从经济上，而且也在从军事上渗入伊朗，伊朗现在也正被拉入所谓“地中海公约”。阿拉伯联盟国家的地位与此略有不同。美国以前在这些国家并没有军事据点，而且，美国也并未承认外约旦。然而，现在有很多迹象证明：联系着拟议中的“地中海公约”，美国已在这些国家发动外交攻势。在步骤上，美国扩张主义者在这里所使用的仍是按照西欧人民所熟悉的方法，即经济“援助”的黄金与继之而来的军事政治公约的枷锁。
    意大利是特别使“大西洋公约”倡导人头痛的因素。由于民主力量的组织良好与团结，意大利统治集团不得不考虑广大人民群众的态度，人民群众不愿意他们的国家卷入任何军事集团。这种形势迫使加斯贝利及其华盛顿主子采用了各种手法，以便掩盖意大利参加拟议中的北大西洋及地中海两个集团。至于法西斯西班牙之直接加入西方联盟或北大西洋联盟，则被认为是未到时机，因为佛朗哥政权受到世界舆论的谴责。所以，它们就建议使西班牙暂时参加“区域性”的地中海公约。
    正如美国外交的其他创造一样，地中海公约是准备用来作为国际反动势力在地中海的工具，以镇压地中海国家的民主与解放运动，奴役这些国家，并把它们拖入有利于华尔街商人的反苏冒险中。这就是战争贩子所策划的地中海公约的实质。但是，地中海各国人民反对把他们拖入任何冒险集团及联盟的决心正在增长，地中海国家的民主力量之强大，足以揭露并粉碎战争贩子的隐密阴谋。
