Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 18th. Anna Louise Strong, an American spy female journalist who once disguised herself with a progressive facade, was arrested in Moscow on February 14th by the Soviet state security organs. According to TASS Moscow dispatch on the 14th, Strong infiltrated the Soviet Union due to the negligence of certain Soviet foreign relations officials. She will be deported within days. Her crime is engaging in anti-Soviet espionage and sabotage activities.

The US government, which is fiercely persecuting all genuine revolutionary fighters and progressives in America, does not conceal its anxiety about the arrest of this spy who superficially opposed American imperialism. According to Agence France-Presse Washington dispatch on the 17th, the US State Department admitted that the US Chargé d'Affaires in Moscow, Kohler, has requested to meet with Strong twice.

　　美国间谍女记者斯特朗被苏逮捕
    【新华社陕北十八日电】曾经伪装进步面貌的美国间谍女记者安那·路易斯·斯特朗，已于二月十四日被苏联国家保安机关在莫斯科逮捕。据塔斯社莫斯科十四日电称：斯特朗是乘苏联某些对外关系官员的疏忽而混入苏联的。她将于日内被驱逐出境。她的罪状是进行反苏的间谍和破坏活动。
    正在凶恶地迫害美国一切真正的革命战士和进步分子的美国政府，对于这个表面上曾经反对美国帝国主义的间谍的被捕，并不掩饰它的焦急。据法新社华盛顿十七日电：美国国务院承认：美驻莫斯科代办柯勒尔已两度要求会见斯特朗。
