Yangquan Yugong Coal Mine Workers
  Conquer Wind, Snow, and Severe Cold to Transport Coal
  Thirteen Days of Coal Transport Totaling Over 180,000 Tons

[Reported by this newspaper] In order to quickly sell stockpiled coal and circulate capital, the Yangquan Yugong Coal Mine mobilized all employees to transport coal from the mine to the station, a distance of 1,400 meters. Through the efforts of all employees in the freezing weather for thirteen days, the task of transporting 180,000 tons of coal was completed. At that time, in order to complete this task, the Party organization in the mine decided that Party members should take the lead. The person in charge of the Party told the Party members: "This work is arduous, and Party members must be at the forefront. This is also a test for Party members!" Communist Party member worker Dong Jiuxiang said after hearing this: "That's right! Communist Party members must take the lead!" At the group leader and pit affairs meetings, some worker group leaders believed that this task was difficult to complete, feeling that so many workers were transferred from the bottom of the pit to work on the surface, and because they had been working at the bottom of the pit for a long time, they were not used to working outside, and they were afraid of the cold in winter, making it even more difficult. Seeing this situation, Dong Jiuxiang said: "I guarantee that all the workers in my group will come to the surface!" Then everyone clamored, and some proposed: "We workers who have been in the mine for a long time must do better than the second and third shifts! We can't work behind the temporary contractors!" On January 3rd, the coal transportation work began. It happened to be particularly bad weather from the 3rd to the 5th, with the gale blowing black dust straight into the face, making it difficult to open one's eyes; in addition, snowflakes kept hitting the workers' faces, and many workers' faces were frozen black and blue, and their lips were trembling, but the coal carts never stopped, and the workers still insisted on running back and forth. Communist Party member and trade union committee member Dong Jiuxiang, suffering from scabies all over his body, limping as he walked, still ran back and forth from the south yard to the north yard just like the workers, constantly encouraging them. The workers spontaneously initiated a three-way competition: comparing speed, comparing love for tools, and comparing arriving at work early and leaving late. Workers who had been working in the mine for many years proposed: "We must be stronger than the second and third shift contractors and set an example for them!" We must surpass the second and third shift contractors in terms of working hours, caring for tools, speed, and slowness. Wang Jin's leg sores were very severe, but he always arrived half an hour early every day. Two workers from the ninth group were three minutes away from getting off work when they pushed back the empty car, but they still had to push it one more time. Zhang Zhanfu, the worker who protected the boiler during the liberation, arrived before work every day. He went to the small station and saw that the workers on the third shift of temporary contractors had lost four wheel chocks, and he found them back one by one. One day, because there were many heavy cars and few unloaders, many car pushers couldn't push. Wang Jin then transferred twelve workers from the bottom of the kiln, and unloaded four hundred cars in eight hours, but the contracting team of twenty-eight people only unloaded two hundred cars, which motivated the contracting team to become more active. As a result of this three-way competition, the long-term kiln bottom workers guaranteed to start working together at six o'clock during working hours, and they loaded the empty cars before getting off work. In terms of caring for tools, the second and third shift contractors were prone to losing small car parts and damaging individual cars, while the long-term workers at the bottom of the kiln not only did not lose them, but also picked up the tools lost by the second and third shifts and handed them over to the mine. In terms of speed, the long-term kiln bottom worker shift pushed one car per person, pushing more than 300 cars a day, while the contracting team pushed one car with two people, pushing more than 100 cars a day. This coal transportation task was successfully completed in thirteen days with the lead of the kiln bottom workers and the joint efforts of the contracting workers! A total of 1,719 workers were used, and 183,744 tons of coal were transported.

　　阳泉裕工煤矿工人
  　战胜风雪严寒运炭
  　十三天运炭十八万余吨
    【本报讯】阳泉裕工煤矿为了很快把存炭卖出去周转资金，发动全体职工从矿场往车站运炭，中间距离一千四百米，全体职工在冰天雪地里，经十三天努力，完成了十八万吨炭的运输任务。当时，为了完成这个任务，矿上的党，就决定由党员带头，党的负责人向党员们说：“这个工作是艰苦的，党员要干到头里，这也是对党员的考验！”共产党员工人董九祥听了后，说：“对！共产党员要带头干！”在各组长和坑务会议上，有的工人大组长认为这个工作难完成，觉着那么多工人由坑底调到坑上工作，由于他们长期在坑底工作，不习惯在坑外干，冬天怕冻，更不容易。董九祥看到这种情况，说：“我保证我组全体工人到坑上来！”接着大家就噪嚷开了，有的提出说：“咱们长期在矿上的工人，还要干的比二班三班好啊！咱们不能干在临时包工的后边！”一月三号，运炭工作开始了，正赶上三号到五号的天气特别坏，狂风吹的黑土直往脸上打，叫人难睁开眼睛；再加雪花不停往工人的脸上打，有很多工人脸冻的黑青，嘴唇发抖，可是运煤小车没停下过，工人们仍然坚持着一回一回的跑，共产党员、工会委员董九祥，满身害着疥，走路一拐一拐的，仍然从南场到北场和工人们一样的来回跑，不断的鼓励工人。工人们自动发起了比快、比爱工具、比上班早、下班晚的三比。长年在矿做工的工人提出说：“咱一定要比二、三班的包工强才行，给他们做个模范！”我们要在上下班时间、爱护工具、快与慢，都超过二、三班的包工。王金腿上疮害的很重，他每天都是早上半个钟头班，九组的两个工人推回空车差三分钟就下班了，他们还要推一回。曾在解放时保护住锅炉的工人张占富，每天都是上班以前到，他到小站看到三班短期包工工人把小车闩丢了四根，一根一根都找回来。有一天因重车多，卸车人少，不少推车工人不能推，王金就又从窑底拨了十二个工人，在八个钟头内卸了四百车，但包工班二十八个人才卸了二百车，带动了包工班也积极了。这样三比的结果，是长期窑底工人在上班时间上，保证了到六点就一齐工作，下班时把空车装好下班。在爱护工具上，二三班包工班好丢小车零件损坏个别小车，而窑底长期工人不但不丢，还能把二三班丢的工具拾回来交到矿上，在速度上窑底长期工人班一人推一车，一天推三百多车，包工班两人推一车，一天推一百多车。这一运炭任务在窑底工人的带头和包工工人一起努力下，经十三天工夫，胜利完成了！共用工一千七百一十九个，运炭十八万三千七百四十四吨。  　　　　　　（武忠）
