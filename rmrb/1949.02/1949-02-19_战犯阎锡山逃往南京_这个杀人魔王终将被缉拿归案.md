Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 17th—War criminal Yan Xishan fled from Taiyuan to Nanjing by plane on the 15th, because if he didn't flee, he would have no chance. Since the beginning of October last year, Taiyuan has been heavily surrounded by the People's Liberation Army. In order to deceive his subordinates, the Yan bandit repeatedly boasted that he was determined to "coexist with Taiyuan City," and even prepared poison. It is reported that he will continue to flee to Taiwan, where he has already arranged houses and property. But people believe that no matter where this murderous demon flees to, he will eventually be brought to justice by the People's Liberation Army.

　　战犯阎锡山逃往南京
  　这个杀人魔王终将被缉拿归案
    【新华社陕北十七日电】战犯阎锡山十五日乘飞机自太原逃跑到南京，因为再不逃跑，他就没有机会了。自去年十月初旬以来，太原就被解放军重重包围。阎匪为了欺骗他的部下，曾多次吹嘘他决心“与太原城共存亡”，甚至准备好了毒药。据悉：他将继续逃到台湾，他在那里早已安置了房屋和财产。但是人们相信，无论这个杀人魔王跑到哪一个天涯地角，他终将被人民解放军缉拿归案。
