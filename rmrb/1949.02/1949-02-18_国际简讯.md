    ▲The British Ministry of Labour, in its review of working conditions in 1948, confirmed that 1948 was a year in which the living standards of the British people continued to decline. The increase in retail prices exceeded the increase in wages. In January 1948, the average wage rate and retail price index were both 104. In December, the wage index rose to 107, while the retail price index jumped to 109. Clothing prices increased the most, rising by 12 percent during the year. The document also revealed that the number of unemployed people in Britain increased from 277,000 to 327,000 in 1948. There were 1,758 strikes, involving 423,000 workers.
