　　Zhangjiakou, Tangshan, Heze
  　Workers Gather to Commemorate the "February 7th" Strike
    Unanimously Vowing to Carry the Revolution Through to the End
    [Our Newspaper Combined Dispatches] In Zhangjiakou, Tangshan, Heze and other places, mass rallies or symposiums were held to commemorate the 26th anniversary of the "February 7th" strike. In Zhangjiakou, 4,000 workers, 2,000 citizens, and various stilt walkers and Yangge dance teams participated in the commemoration. Comrade Sun Ming, Secretary of the Zhangjiakou Municipal Party Committee, representatives from the Chahar Provincial Federation of Trade Unions, the Zhangjiakou Municipal Committee Preparatory Committee, and the Ping-Sui Railway General Trade Union, Comrade Xu Ping, and veteran workers who participated in the "February 7th" struggle spoke at the meeting. In his speech, Comrade Xu Ping explained that the workers in Zhangjiakou already have their own trade union organizations, enjoy a democratic and free life, and have become masters of the new society. He called on the worker brothers to defend the victorious achievements gained by the working class through arduous struggle in the 26 years since "February 7th," to actively engage in production, support the war, and carry the revolution through to the end. When railway workers Yang Zhenhua and Han Baozhu, who participated in the "February 7th" struggle, spoke about the heroic and tragic deeds of the worker leaders at that time, who were brutally beaten, shot, imprisoned, and subjected to various persecutions and coercions by the ruling class, all the workers and the masses present shouted with indignation: "Inherit the revolutionary tradition of 'February 7th,' carry the revolution through to the end, and always follow Chairman Mao!" and other slogans. In Tangshan, the temporary preparatory committee of employees held a forum for worker representatives from various mines and factories at the Kailuan Club. More than 300 worker representatives from eleven units, including Kailuan Mines, Beining Railway, Qixin Cement Company, Huaxin Yarn Factory, Steel Plant, and Power Company, attended the meeting. At the meeting, many representatives exposed the crimes of the reactionaries in oppressing workers with their own painful experiences, and unanimously expressed that they would carry the revolution through to the end under the leadership of the Communist Party from now on. Heze City held a mass rally to commemorate "February 7th" and celebrate the liberation of Peiping and Tientsin. Comrade Xu Yunbei, representative of the CCP Jilu豫 Regional Committee, and representatives from the city's workers, peasants, soldiers, students, and business circles attended the meeting. They exposed the Kuomintang reactionaries' fake peace conspiracy by accusing the Kuomintang bandit troops of various crimes committed when they occupied Heze. Everyone believed that the people could only obtain true peace by completely destroying the Kuomintang's reactionary rule. The meeting also passed telegrams of respect to Chairman Mao and Commander-in-Chief Zhu, and condolences to the People's Liberation Army who liberated Peiping and Tientsin.
