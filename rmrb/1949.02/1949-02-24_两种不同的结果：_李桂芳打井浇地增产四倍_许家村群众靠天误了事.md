　　Two Different Outcomes:
  　Li Guifang's Well-Watered Fields Quadruple Production
    Xu Village's Residents Relied on Heaven and Suffered
    [JiZhong News] In Changyangdian Village, Renqiu County, the masses are actively preparing to dig wells. Last spring, when the initiative to dig wells was launched, production committee member Li Guifang took the lead in digging a well and also led twenty-five farming households in digging ten brick wells and fifteen earthen wells. Those households who dug wells all benefited that year. For example, after Li Guifang dug a well, he transformed his three and a half mu of land into garden plots, planting corn, winter melon, chives, and cabbage, producing crops throughout the year, equivalent to 3,225 jin of rice. His other three mu of good land only produced 600 jin of rice; the garden plots produced four times more than the dry land. Other households who dug wells all increased their grain production significantly. Everyone happily said, "Heaven can't be relied on; digging wells is a good solution." Another example: In Xujia Village, Jianguo County, there was a drought and lack of rain last summer, and the crops were withered and dying. People did not actively seek ways to dig wells, but just hoped for rain every day, day after day, but they did not see a single raindrop. People all regretfully said, "Relying on heaven ruined everything. To prevent droughts, we must dig wells in the future!"

　　两种不同的结果：
  　李桂芳打井浇地增产四倍
    许家村群众靠天误了事
    【冀中讯】任邱县长羊店村，群众正酝酿着动手打井。去年春天发动打井时，生产委员李桂芳带头打了一个井，又领导二十五户农民，共打了十个砖井，十五个土井。这些打井户当年都得到了好处，如李桂芳打井以后，把三亩半地变成了园地，种的玉米、北瓜、韭菜、白菜，全年出产，折米三千二百二十五斤。他另外的三亩好地，只产米六百斤，园地比旱地增产四倍。其他打井户，都增产很多粮食，大家欢喜的说：“天可靠不住，打井是好办法”。另一个：是建国县许家村，去年夏季天旱缺雨，庄稼都旱的枯黄要死，人们不积极想办法打井，只是天天盼天下雨，盼一天又一天，没盼到一颗雨点。人们都后悔的说：“靠天误了大事，要防备天旱，今后非打井不可！”
