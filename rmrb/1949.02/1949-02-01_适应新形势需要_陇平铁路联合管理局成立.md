　　To Adapt to the Needs of the New Situation
  　Long-Ping Railway Joint Administration Established
    Xinhua News Agency, Central Plains, 30th. In order to make railway construction adapt to the needs of the developing new situation, the Central Plains Military Region Headquarters specially telegraphed to order the original Zhengzhou Joint Management Committee of the Longhai-Pinghan Railway to be changed to the Long-Ping Railway Joint Administration, and appointed Wu Shi'en as Director, Tian Yumin as Deputy Director, and Xu Ziwei as the military representative of the Central Plains Military Region stationed in the Long-Ping Railway Bureau. On the 17th of this month, the bureau held a joint meeting of section chiefs and above, announcing the official establishment of the Administration. The Director and Deputy Director officially took office and discussed future railway construction work. At the meeting, Xu Ziwei, representing the Communist Party of China, explained that the Party measures people by their moral character, abilities, and qualifications, which is fundamentally different from the Kuomintang's feudal and sectarian practices of employing personal connections. No matter who it is, as long as they wholeheartedly serve the people, they will definitely be able to find a suitable job in the revolutionary ranks. Director Wu Shi'en expressed his willingness to do his best to serve the people, and hoped that all employees would in the future: 1. combine politics and technology; 2. employee living standards should not be too disparate, and should take care of each other; 3. go deep into the lower levels to understand the situation and provide specific guidance; 4. cultivate a pragmatic work style of doing what is said, and oppose corruption, embezzlement, and malfeasance. Director Wu also called on everyone to work together to complete the transportation tasks. Finally, Deputy Director Tian Yumin hoped that everyone would summarize the work of the past takeover stage, sort out all railway property and materials, and make future work plans based on the existing foundation and conditions, so that railway construction work would gradually get on the right track. Director Wu Shi'en is from Zhenjiang, Jiangsu, 60 years old this year. In the late Guangxu period of the Qing Dynasty, he graduated from Shanghai Fudan University, and then transferred to Tangshan Institute of Technology for three years. In the second year of the Republic of China, he entered the Longhai Railway Bureau as an engineering intern, and successively served as supervisor, draftsman, surveyor, assistant engineer, deputy chief engineer, chief engineer, section chief, chief of the engineering department, deputy director of the Longhai Railway, and deputy director of the Pinghan Railway.
