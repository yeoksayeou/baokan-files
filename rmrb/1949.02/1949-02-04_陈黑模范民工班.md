　　The Seventh Squad of the Luan County Civilian Laborer Stretcher Team was hailed as a model squad during the Suiyuan Campaign. All the squad members, except for the leader and deputy leader who were middle-aged, were young men, all full of energy and high spirits. At the farewell meeting before leaving home, the district head called on them to win more glory for the entire district. Over the past four months of trials, they responded to the district head's call with practical actions.

　　The squad of eleven men, led and motivated by four Communist Party members, were as united as one person. They traveled five thousand *li*, without a single straggler or deserter. Squad leader Chen Hei was a loyal and honest farmer, who consulted with everyone to solve various difficulties encountered during the march, and highly practiced democracy. When camping in a village west of Baotou, the village was small and couldn't accommodate everyone, and the weather was cold, making it impossible to sleep. After discussing it, Chen Hei and the others spread some firewood on the ground, and the whole squad lay down in a circle, heads facing out and feet facing in, covered with quilts, and slept warmly through the night. When crossing the Da Yang River, many holes were broken in the ice surface by horses, and water gushed out. Some places required wading. Other units walking on it would slip and fall on their backs, or accidentally fall into the holes. However, after discussion, the squad decided that one person would lead another with a long pole, probing forward, forming a line, and safely crossed in an orderly manner.

　　Wherever they stayed, they integrated with the local masses. They reviewed their mass discipline every three days. In addition to fetching water, sweeping courtyards, and chopping grass to feed livestock for the landlords, they mainly actively promoted the Party's policies. When stationed in a village, the landlord's old lady mentioned that her son had been captured by the Kuomintang to serve as a soldier in Zhangjiakou last year and had no news since then, she cried incessantly. But after they explained the Party's policies to her, the old lady was overjoyed, and quickly took out her son's photo and handed it to them, and told them her son's age, asking them to take care of him and help her find him. When the whole squad moved houses, the old lady was reluctant to part with them. Later, when she heard that the squad had sick soldiers, she carried a bowl of noodles and went door-to-door asking for their residence, to give to the sick soldiers. Because they did a good job in mass work, actively promoted the Party's policies, and educated the masses, the masses also provided them with many conveniences.

　　Everyone in the squad understood who the wounded soldiers were fighting for, and cared for them with special care. In Baotou, each person received ten *liang* of sugar. Liu Jinzheng and others were reluctant to eat it and gave it to the wounded soldiers when they were thirsty, because they were not allowed to drink water casually without the doctor's permission. They usually used hot towels to wipe the mouths of the wounded soldiers who were dry. When the wounded soldiers were hungry, they took out the biscuits they had brought to feed them. Sometimes they forgot their fatigue when carrying the wounded soldiers. Communist Party member Liu Jinzheng's foot was swollen, but he still endured the pain and carried them for forty *li*.

　　The Lunar New Year was approaching, and many team members had fluctuations in their minds because of this, hoping to go home for a reunion year, but the Chen Hei Squad was not affected in the slightest. They all wrote letters home, each expressing their attitude and determination while away. Squad leader Chen Hei told his father in his letter: "Whether I can go back for the New Year depends on how the situation develops. You prepare for it, don't wait for me." Deputy squad leader Meng Gouqun said: "It's not decent to go home for the New Year until all the enemies in North China are wiped out." Some even said: "When we came, the district head had such high hopes for us, we would be embarrassed to see the district head if we couldn't carry the model flag." Now the whole squad is full of enthusiasm and is waiting for a glorious task.

　　陈黑模范民工班
    栾城民工担架队一连七班，这次绥远战役中被誉为模范班。全班队员除正副班长是壮年外，都是年青小伙子，个个精神焕发，情绪高涨。离家的欢送会上区长曾号召他们要给全区多争光荣回来，四个多月考验里，他们以实际行动响亮地回答了区长的号召。
    全班十一人，在四个共产党员带头与推动之下，团结得象一个人，转战五千里，连一个掉队的也没有，更无逃亡。班长陈黑是一个忠诚老实的农民，行军中所遇各种困难都和大家商量解决，高度实行民主。在包头西某村宿营时，村小人多住不下，天气又冷，没法睡觉、他班大伙一商量，在地上铺了些柴，全班头朝外脚朝内躺成一个圆圈，上面盖上被子，温暖的睡了一夜。过大洋河时，因冰面被马踏破了很多窟窿，水涌了出来，有的地方须要涉水，别的单位走在上面，有的仰面滑倒，有的失足漏进窟窿去。但该班经大家研究后，决定一人拿大杆带领一人，试探前进，一字式排成行列，安然渡过，秩序井然。
    他们住在那里，就和那里的群众打成一片，每隔三天检讨一次群众纪律，除了给房东挑水、扫院子，铡草喂牲口以外。主要地是积极的宣传了党的政策。在某村住军时，房东老太太提起他儿子在去年被国民党抓到张家口当兵至今无音讯时，啼哭不休，但经他们给她讲了党的政策后，老太太顿时喜出望外，连忙取出他儿子的像片交给他们，并告诉他儿子的岁数，要他们多加照顾，帮她找到。全班搬房子时，老太太依依难舍，后来她听说该班有了病号，端着一瓢子面，沿街打听他们住处，送给病号吃。因为他们群众工作做的好，积极宣传党的政策，教育群众，群众也多给他们以不少方便。
    全班人都懂得战士负伤是为了谁，对伤员格外关心爱护，在包头每人领了十两糖，刘金争等三人舍不得吃掉，伤员口渴时，因不经医生允许不能随便给水喝，他们便拿出糖来送给伤员。平时常用热手巾给口干的伤员拭嘴，伤员饿了，便拿出自己所带的饼喂伤员吃。抬伤员有时忘记了疲劳，共产党员刘金争一只脚肿起，仍忍疼抬了四十里。
    旧历年快到了，不少队员们的脑子里，曾因此引起过波动，盼望着能回家过团圆年，但陈黑班却不受丝毫影响，都向家写信，各人向家表明各人的在外的态度与决心。班长陈黑在信中告诉他父亲说：“我能否回去过年，还得看形势怎样发展，你们准备着过吧，不要等我。”副班长孟勾群说：“不把华北敌人消灭完，回家过年也不体面。”更有人说：“来时区长对咱希望那样高，扛不了模范旗不好意思见区长。”现全班情绪饱满，正等待光荣的任务。
