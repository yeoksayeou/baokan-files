Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 22nd. The Hague dispatch: "De Waarheid" (formerly transliterated as De Val Hai Bao), the organ of the Dutch Communist Party and one of the largest newspapers in the Netherlands, with a daily circulation of 200,000, demanded on the 17th that the reactionary Dutch government conduct a "strict investigation" into the massacre of anti-war Dutch soldiers by the Dutch military authorities in Indonesia, and formally announce the incident to the Dutch people. The newspaper quoted a recent announcement by a secret Indonesian radio station stating that 213 Dutch soldiers stationed in Fort de Kock, Sumatra, were executed by the Dutch authorities for refusing to fight against Indonesian guerrillas. The bodies of those executed were all thrown into local fish ponds.
