Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 29th. A dispatch from Domei News Agency, Tokyo, on the 25th, stated: The final figures of the Japanese general election more clearly demonstrate the widespread nature of the Japanese Communist Party's victory. The JCP won a total of 35 seats in the House of Representatives, receiving 3.5 million votes, nearly 10% of the total votes cast. More significantly, Tokyo voters firmly chose the communists, with all seven JCP candidates elected in the city by a large majority. A Reuters dispatch from Tokyo on the same day stated: In various locations, the communist candidates who were defeated lost by a small margin; with just a few more votes, the JCP could have gained another 31 seats.

Although MacArthur expressed satisfaction with the Democratic Liberal Party, representing "conservative government thought," for seizing the majority, this cannot conceal the "anxiety of American personnel about the significant victory of the Communist Party" (Agence France-Presse, 24th). A Reuters dispatch from Tokyo on the 25th stated: "Political observers today unanimously believe that the victory of the Communist Party has overshadowed even the overwhelming majority obtained by the conservative parties. Observers from the occupation authorities view the JCP's victory with even greater concern. They fear that further victories of the Communist Party are inevitable."

　　日共竞选胜利
  　美反动派黯然失色
    【新华社陕北二十九日电】据电通社东京二十五日电称：日本大选的最后数字，更明显地表明了日本共产党胜利的广泛性质。日共在选举中共获得众议员三十五席，获得选票三百五十万张，几占全部投票总数的百分之十。更有意义的是，东京市选民坚决地选择了共产党人，日共七位候选人在该市均以巨大的多数当选。路透社同日东京电称：在各地落选的共产党候选人，相差票数很少，只要增加几票，日共即可再获三十一席。
    虽然麦克阿瑟对代表“保守政府思想”的民主自由党之窃取多数，声明表示满意，但这并不能掩盖“美国人士对共产党显著胜利的焦虑”（法新社二十四日电）。路透社东京二十五日电称：“政治观察家今日一致认为，共产党的胜利，甚至使保守政党之获得压倒多数，为之黯然失色。占领当局观察家以更严重的观点来看日共的胜利。他们害怕，共产党的进一步胜利是不可避免的。”
