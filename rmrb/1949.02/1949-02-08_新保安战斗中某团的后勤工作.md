　　The Logistics Work of a Certain Regiment in the Battle of Xinbaoan
　　During the Xinbaoan battle on the Pingzhang line, the logistics work of a certain regiment of the People's Liberation Army was unanimously praised by the commanders and fighters. This was due to the regiment committee's emphasis on logistics work, in-depth mobilization, and strict organizational division of labor, which enabled the entire regiment to successfully complete its tasks in terms of food supply, ammunition transport, wounded rescue and transfer, and prisoner escort throughout the entire battle process, ensuring the victory of the battle and saving manpower. In terms of food, for more than ten days after surrounding the enemy, each company was able to eat at least one meal of pancakes or hot rolled pancakes every day. The cooks of each company ground the millet they received into flour overnight to improve the food. The regiment also organized a unified purchase of more than 20 pigs and a large amount of cabbage and vermicelli from villages south of the Yongding River, and made its own tofu, overcoming the difficulty of having no vegetables locally, and ensuring that the troops could eat meat and vegetables every day. In terms of ammunition supply, explosives and hand grenades were continuously sent up as soon as the city wall was breached. During the battle, the companies and battalions did not feel any shortage of ammunition. Wounded soldiers were able to be transferred to the rear from dangerous areas in a very short time after being injured, and it was ensured that no wounded or martyrs were left behind. The comrades responsible for rescuing the wounded on the battlefield followed the troops forward. When the stretchers were used up, the regiment immediately organized the cooks into thirteen stretchers, carrying them back and forth for five miles twice. Wounded soldiers and prisoners of war were escorted back by the comrades who rescued the wounded, stretcher bearers, and cooks who delivered food, greatly saving the strength of the front line troops.
　　The reason why the regiment's logistics work was able to achieve such results was mainly due to the regiment committee's emphasis on this work, in-depth mobilization before the war, and strict organizational work. Before the war, the regiment convened meetings with the heads of the regimental and battalion direct units and the cooks, quartermasters, administrators, sergeants, cultural and educational officers, doctors, bugle platoon leaders, and barber platoon leaders of each battalion and company. In addition to educating them about the victorious situation and the favorable conditions for the current battle, they also criticized and explained the past mentality that everyone thought the battle had nothing to do with them, and proposed that those who participate in rear service could also perform meritorious service, breaking the past view that logistics personnel could not perform meritorious service. After the meeting, small groups were organized to discuss and deliberate, and the groups launched challenges to each other, requiring testing in the battle. For example, a certain doctor with less combat experience in the past proposed to ensure calm and bold work on the battlefield this time, and would not leave the operating room even if the planes and artillery shells were fierce. The clerks and secretaries of each company and battalion also proposed challenges, guaranteeing not to lose a wounded soldier on the battlefield. The management staff ran around in each battalion, spreading the advantages and disadvantages of the food in each battalion, arousing the competitive spirit of the cooks. The supply director and the health captain also announced their guarantees in front of the entire regiment, vowing not to fall behind everyone. All the comrades participating in logistics were nervously mobilized. Ma, deputy director of the regimental political department, led and organized the supply director, health captain, logistics staff, and other comrades to form a logistics work command group. It was divided into transportation, rescue, food supply, labor, stretcher, and prisoner escort groups. Each group concentrated all the odd-job personnel of the entire regiment according to their work nature and strength. For example, the administrators of each battalion were the logistics and food platoon leaders of the battalion. The cooks of each company formed a squad, with the quartermaster as the squad leader. The regimental management staff specialized in inspecting and urging the improvement of their food. The deputy political instructors of each battalion were responsible for concentrating the deputy officers, cultural and educational personnel, health workers, and medical assistants of each company to engage in front-line rescue of wounded soldiers, transportation of ammunition, and escort of prisoners. The pack mules of the machine gun company of each battalion and the barbers and other odd-job personnel of the units directly under the regiment were concentrated in the regiment and controlled by the regiment as mobile forces. Deputy Director Ma was specifically responsible for liaison and adjusting forces. The supply director was responsible for transportation and supply. The health captain and the civil affairs officer were responsible for rescue guidance and the adjustment of labor. The entire organization had specialized divisions of labor, but it was not mechanical. For example, anyone coming from the front to the rear had to do the work of transferring wounded soldiers and escorting prisoners. In this way, everyone played a role of "doing their best" in the entire battle process, completing the arduous and complex logistics tasks in the battle. (Zhao Tieliang)

　　新保安战斗中某团的后勤工作
    平张线新保安战斗中，解放军某团的后勤工作，获得了指战员们一致赞扬。这由于团委领导上对后勤工作重视，深入动员和严密的组织分工，使得全团在整个战斗过程中、给养上、弹药运输上、伤员抢救转运和俘虏的押送上，都能圆满的完成任务，保证了战斗的胜利，并节省了人力。在伙食上，从包围敌人以后十余天中，各连每天至少都能吃到一顿煎饼或烫卷饼，各连的炊事员同志把领到的小米连夜磨成面来改善伙食。团里并统一组织去永定河南各村买回二十多口猪和大批白菜、粉条，并自己做豆腐，克服了当地没菜的困难，保证了部队每天都能吃上肉和菜。在弹药供给上、炸药、手榴弹在城墙刚一突破时，就源源不绝的送了上来，作战中，各连营丝毫没有感到弹药缺乏的困难。伤员在负伤后，都能在极短时间内，脱离危险地带转送后方，并保证和做到了不遗漏一个伤员和烈士。负责战场抢救伤员的同志都是跟着部队一同前进，在担架刚用完时，团里又立即把炊事员组织成十三付担架，往返五里地抬了两次，伤员、战场俘虏都由抢救伤员的同志和担架员以及送饭的炊事员们回来时往下押送带回，大大节约了前方的兵力。
    该团后勤工作所以能获得这样成绩的原因，主要是由于团委领导上对这一工作的重视，战前的深入动员和严密组织工作。团里在战前就分别召集了团营直属队及各营连的炊事班长、司务长、管理员、上士、文教、医生、司号班长、理发班长等开会。除把胜利形势和当前战斗的有利条件进行教育外，并针对着过去大家认为战斗与他们无关的心理进行了批判解释，提出参加后动人员一样可以立功，打破过去认为后勤人员不能立功的说法。会后下来，就分别小组讨论酝酿，各组互相发起挑战比赛，要求在战斗中考验。如某医生过去战斗经验较差，这次提出保证在战场上沉着大胆的工作，不管飞机炮弹怎样凶，一步也不离开手术室。各连营文书、书记，也都提出挑战，保证战场上不丢一个伤员，管理参谋在各营跑来跑去，传播各营伙食的优缺点，引起了炊事员同志的竞赛情绪。供给主任、卫生队长也在全团面前宣布自己的保证，决不落在大家后面。整个参加后勤的同志，就都紧张的动员起来了。以团政治处马副主任领导组织了供给处主任、卫生队长、后勤参谋等同志为后勤工作指挥组。下分运输、抢救、给养、民工、担架、押送俘虏等小组。各小组又把全团的勤杂人员，按工作性质、力量，集中起来。如各营管理员为营的后勤伙食排长。各连炊事员组成班，以司务长为班长。团管理参谋就专门检查督促他们伙食的改善。各营的副政教负责集中各连副职、文教人员、卫生员、医助等从事前线抢救伤员、运输弹药、押送俘虏。各营机枪连上的驮骡和团部直属队的理发员及其他勤杂人员，则集中在团，由团掌握作为机动力量。马副主任专门负责联络、调剂力量。供给主任负责运输供给。卫生队长与民运干事担任抢救指导和民工的调剂。整个组织上有专门的分工，同时又不是机械的，如由前方到后方来的人，不管是谁，都要做送转伤号和押送俘虏的工作。这样使在整个战斗进程中，每个人都起到了“人尽其力”的作用，完成了战斗中的艰巨繁复的后勤任务。  （赵铁良）
