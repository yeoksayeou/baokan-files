　　Medical Services Rank First in the World
  　Huge Development of Soviet Healthcare
    Total Medical Staff Reaches Two Million
  　People Can All Receive Free Medical Treatment
    【Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 20th】 The Communist Party of the Soviet Union and the Soviet government are extremely concerned about the development of national healthcare. The quality of medical services for the people and the number of employed doctors in the Soviet Union both rank first in the world. In the 1947 national budget, 18 billion rubles were used for healthcare; in 1948, it increased to more than 20 billion rubles; this year, healthcare will have further development. In the Tsarist era, the mortality rate of the Russian people ranked first in Europe. In 1937, when the Soviet Union's second five-year plan was completed, the mortality rate was 40 percent lower than before the revolution. The average life expectancy of the Soviet people has been extended. As early as 1926-1927, the life expectancy of men had increased by ten years compared to before the revolution, and women by thirteen years. Now, the state spends eighty times more on healthcare for each person than in the Tsarist era, and all people receive free medical treatment. The total number of medical personnel reaches as many as two million, including more than 10,000 medical doctors and scientists, more than 180,000 doctors, and hundreds of thousands of nurses. Soviet higher education institutions train four times more doctors each year than the United States. The Soviet government not only attaches importance to healthcare and medical work in factories and cities, but is also extensively expanding the network of rural medical institutions to serve collective farmers and agricultural workers. The output of factories under the Soviet Ministry of Public Health increased by 32.7 percent in 1948 compared to 1947. The production of medical equipment and supplies has also greatly increased. Last year, the production of 260 new drugs and various medical devices was also started. The prices of various drugs, including penicillin, have been greatly reduced.
    【Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 20th】 The Soviet government, industrial managers, and trade union leaders are constantly working to improve the welfare and health of workers. In 1948, the state spent more than one billion rubles on ventilation equipment, sanitation, lighting, and safety equipment to prevent dangers in the workplace. A large amount of money is spent each year on medical and epidemic prevention expenses for workers in factories, mines, and oil fields. All large industrial enterprises are equipped with hospitals with X-ray and natural therapy equipment. The Donets Basin mines also have ultraviolet therapy equipment specially designed for the health of miners. Various factories generally have night sanatoriums, which are mostly located near the factories, and their expenses are paid by the social insurance fund, so the hospitalized workers do not have to spend a penny. At the end of 1948, more than 100,000 workers lived in night sanatoriums.
