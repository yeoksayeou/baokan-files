Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, February 9th: The Electronegative Society of Telecommunications, Prague, reports: The Fifth Plenary Session of the Central Committee of the Greek Communist Party passed a resolution criticizing right-wing and opportunistic tendencies within the party. The resolution pointed out: Right-wing and opportunistic tendencies within the Greek Communist Party are mainly manifested in viewpoints such as, "It is impossible to form a revolutionary regular army without foreign aid; and small guerrilla units should replace the revolutionary regular army." Several party members holding senior positions hold these views. The Central Plenary Session pointed out: The spread of these right-wing and opportunistic tendencies is the result of external influences hostile to the Greek national liberation struggle and the application of ideological pressure by the imperialist and war camp.

Another criticism raised in the Central Plenary Session's resolution concerns the work of the Athens branch of the Greek Communist Party's Political Bureau. The resolution stated: Opportunistic influences were allowed to infiltrate the Athens branch of the Political Bureau, resulting in the branch's work not being done well. The Athens branch of the Political Bureau adopted a compromise attitude towards the royalist fascist terror. In Athens and other cities controlled by the royalist fascists, there were tens of thousands of people waiting for an opportunity to join the Greek Democratic Army, but the Athens branch did not do the work to give them this opportunity.

The resolution criticized the party's leadership during the German occupation, pointing out that at that time, the party's leadership was far from the Leninist-Stalinist line. The struggle against British imperialism in December 1944 was unorganized and unprepared. "We could have defeated British intervention militarily at that time. Those who doubted that we could defeat British intervention at that time are precisely those who today believe it is impossible to form a revolutionary regular army."

The Central Plenary Session's resolution emphatically pointed out that the United States is openly interfering in Greece, and American troops are participating in combat. The Central Plenary Session's resolution declared: If all Communist Party members complete their tasks well, it is possible to defeat the royalist fascists and the United States and Britain. Greek Communist Party members are, and must be, role models in all aspects, prepared to sacrifice themselves. Four members of the Central Committee of the Greek Communist Party have already sacrificed themselves in the war. The resolution also stated: "Although we have made mistakes and have shortcomings, the Greek people believe that our path—the path the people are advancing on—is correct."

The resolution continued: We must protect the connection between the Democratic Army and the people, regard it as the most precious treasure, and not allow intentional anti-people behavior to occur. If it occurs, it must be punished. Arbitrary destruction of captured towns is not allowed, and the property of small merchants and craftsmen must not be confiscated. Party members must mobilize the townspeople to fight for their own survival.

The Central Plenary Session's resolution also stated: The soldiers of the Greek Democratic Army must not regard the soldiers of the royalist fascist army and the National Guard as "evil fascists," but should enable them to form democratic groups within the royalist fascist army.

The Central Plenary Session's resolution, in listing the new tasks of the Greek Communist Party, declared that in the matter of obtaining reserves for the Democratic Army, "we must solve this problem that we failed to solve last year."

The Central Plenary Session's resolution discussed the full and massive support given by the Slavic Macedonians within Greece to the democratic cause; pointing out that the Slavic Macedonians in Greece will be victorious in the struggle to establish a democratic Greece and strive for equality and freedom. The resolution emphasized that the unity between Greeks and Slavic Macedonians must be strengthened, and chauvinistic (exclusionary and narrow nationalism) tendencies must be crushed.

The Central Plenary Session's resolution emphatically stated that Greece will never become a bridgehead for warmongers, and the Greek Communist Party is always faithful to proletarian internationalism and faithful to the doctrines of Marx, Engels, Lenin, and Stalin. The Greek Communist Party continues to follow the Leninist-Stalinist path.

The resolution finally called out: "Everyone armed, everything for victory, until the day of victory."

　　希共五中全会通过决定
  　批评党内右倾与机会主义偏向
    【新华社陕北九日电】电通社布拉格讯：希腊共产党第五届中央全会通过了关于批评党内右倾与机会主义偏向的决定。决定指出：希腊共产党内右倾与机会主义的偏向，主要地表现在这些观点上，即“没有外援便不可能组成革命正规军；并且应该以小股游击队代替革命正规军”。若干担负高级工作的党员便持有这些观点。中央全会指出：这些右倾与机会主义的偏向之蔓延，是敌视希腊民族解放斗争的党外影响及帝国主义与战争阵营施用思想压力的结果。
    中央全会决定中提出的另一点批评，是关于希共政治局雅典分局的工作。决定称：机会主义的影响，竟被容许侵入政治局的雅典分局，结果使分局的工作没有做好。政治局雅典分局对保皇法西斯的恐怖，采取了妥协态度。在雅典和保皇法西斯所控制的其他城市中，都有成千成万的人等待着机会参加希腊民主军，但是，雅典分局却没有去做给他们以这种机会的工作。
    决定批评了德国占领期间党的领导，指出当时党的领导远远地离开了列宁——斯大林主义的路线。一九四四年十二月反对英帝国主义的斗争，是无组织和无准备的。“我们当时本可以在军事上打败英国的干涉。当时怀疑我们可以打败英国干涉的人们，正就是今天认为不可能组成革命正规军的那些人。”
    中央全会的决定着重指明，美国是在公开地干涉希腊，美国的军队在参加作战。中央全会的决定宣称：如果所有的共产党员都很好地完成他们的任务，是可能打败保皇法西斯和美英两国的。希腊共产党的党员，正是而且必须是在各方面以身作则、准备着牺牲自己的。希共已经有四位中央委员在战争中牺牲。决定又称：“虽然我们犯了错误，有缺点，但是，希腊人民相信：我们的道路——人民所前进着的道路是正确的。”
    决定继称：我们必须保卫民主军与人民间的联系，把它看作最可珍贵的珍宝，不容许发生有意的反人民的行为。如果发生，须加处分。不容许任意破坏攻克的市镇，不可没收小商人和手艺匠人的财产。党员们必须动员市镇人民为自身的生存而斗争。
    中央全会的决定又称：希腊民主军的战士们，必须不要把保皇法西斯军和国民警卫队的士兵认为是“罪恶的法西斯分子”，而应该使他们在保皇法西斯军内部形成民主小组。
    中央全会的决定在列举希腊共产党的新任务时宣称，在为民主军取得后备的问题上，“我们必须解决我们去年所未能解决的这一问题”。
    中央全会的决定论述到希腊境内的斯拉夫马其顿人所给予民主事业的充分而浩大的支持；指出希腊的斯拉夫马其顿人在建立民主希腊，争取平等自由的斗争中，将获得胜利。决定强调指出：希腊人与斯拉夫马其顿人的团结必须加强，沙文主义（排外的狭隘民族主义）的偏向必须加以粉碎。
    中央全会的决定着重的说明，希腊绝不会变为战争贩子的桥头堡垒，希腊共产党始终忠实于无产阶级的国际主义，忠实于马恩列斯的学说。希腊共产党继续遵循列宁斯大林的道路。
    决定最后号召：“人人武装起来，一切为了胜利，直到取得胜利的那一天。”
