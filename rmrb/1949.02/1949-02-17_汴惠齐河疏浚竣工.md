    [Xinhua News Agency, Central Plains, 15th] The Kaifeng Municipal People's Government, since December 7th of last year, led the citizens in dredging the Huiqi River within the city, which had been silted up for more than ten years. The entire dredging project was completed on January 27th. In the past, before the riverbank areas were submerged, annual production of salt, alkali, saltpeter, etc., amounted to several million catties. Since the silting, approximately twenty square li of the city became a waterlogged area. After the river was dredged, over a thousand disaster-stricken residents along the river were able to return to their old professions and resume production.

　　汴惠齐河疏浚竣工
    【新华社中原十五日电】开封市人民政府自去年十二月七日起，领导市民疏浚市内淤塞了十余年的惠齐河，全部疏浚工程已于一月廿七日完成。过去该河沿岸地区未被淹没时，每年可产盐、碱、火硝等数百万斤。自淤塞以来，城内约二十余方里地区尽成泽国。该河疏浚以后，沿河千余户受灾居民得以重归故业，恢复生产。
