　　Shenze Zhizyao Village Prepares for Spring Plowing
　　Poor Peasants' Fertilization Reaches Pre-War Levels
　　[Jizhong Dispatch] In Shenze's Sixth District, the land reform work in Xiaozhiyao Village has been completely finished, and it is basically finished in Dazhiyao Village as well. Most of the farmers in both villages, having dispelled their ideological concerns, are eagerly purchasing livestock, repairing farm tools, and stepping up manure accumulation to actively prepare for the great spring production this year. Since plowing and sowing wheat last autumn, the villagers have been getting up early every day to haul soil and line pigpens. Of the 316 households in the village, almost every family is raising pigs in pens. Last winter, each pen yielded an average of 20 to 30 loads of manure. Dazhiyao's poor peasant Zhang Donglai, who has four mu of garden land and five mu of dry land, used to apply no more than nine cartloads of manure each year. But after being allocated a share of an ox last winter, he has accumulated 16 cartloads of manure, an increase of more than two-thirds. He plans to apply another portion of fertilizer to his six mu of wheat fields, and this spring, he expects to apply at least four cartloads of manure to each mu of his spring land, more than doubling the amount compared to previous years. Zhang Hucheng, a family of four with ten mu of land, rarely applied manure to his fields in the past due to a lack of housing and pigpens. This year, he has already accumulated 13 cartloads of manure. He plans to plant six mu of spring seedlings, aiming to apply three cartloads of manure to each mu. After obtaining livestock and housing, the poor and hired peasants in these two villages have reached the pre-War of Resistance against Japan levels of manure accumulation, and some have even exceeded it. They are even more focused on purchasing livestock and repairing and adding farm tools. Xiaozhiyao has added 16 and a half head of livestock since the land reform two years ago. Middle peasant He Dajun added a new cart; a bad mule was exchanged for a good one. Since the end of the land reform, Dazhiyao has added five head of cattle, 15 harrows, more than 40 plows, repaired eight carts, and other farm tools. Under the influence of the peasants' active production, all twelve landlords and rich peasants in Xiaozhiyao, whose land was requisitioned, except for a few who have not yet begun preparations due to a lack of labor, are also raising pigs, accumulating manure, and participating in production, transitioning into labor.

　　深泽直要村准备春耕
  　贫农施肥达战前水平
    【冀中电】深泽六区小直要村结束土改工作，已全部完成，大直要村也已基本上完成。两村的大部农民，由于打消了思想顾虑，纷纷购买牲口，修补农具，加紧积肥积极准备今春大生产。自去年秋耕种麦以来，该村农民们每天早起拉土垫圈，全村三百十六户，差不多家家有圈养猪，去冬平均每圈起粪二、三十担。大直要贫农张东来，四亩园地五亩旱地，往年每年不过下九车粪，而去冬分了一股牛后，已积肥十六车，增加了三分之二以上，他打算除在六亩麦田里再施一部肥料外，今年的春地每亩最少能下四车粪，超过往年一倍。张虎城四口人十亩地，往年因没房没猪圈，地里很少下粪，今年已积粪十三车，他打算种春苗六亩，每亩争取下三车粪。这两村的贫雇农，在得到牲口和房屋后，积肥已达抗日战争以前的水平，有的甚至超过。在购买牲口，修理和添置农具上，抓的更紧，小直要自前年土改以来，已增添牲口十六头半。中农贺大俊添了新车；坏骡子换成了好骡子。大直要自结束土改以来，增添了牛五头，耙十五个，犁四十多件，修理大车八辆，及其他农具等。在农民积极生产的影响下小直要地主和被征收了土地的富农共十二户，除个别因劳力缺乏，尚未进行准备外，其余十家也都养猪积肥，参加生产，转入了劳动。
