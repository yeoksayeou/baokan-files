Xinhua News Agency, Central Plains, 31st — Through resolute military suppression combined with considerable political offensives, and the correct implementation of the policy of "punishing the ringleaders, not holding the coerced accountable, and rewarding the meritorious," coupled with the influence of victories on battlefields across the country, the bandit suppression work in the Western Henan liberated area has achieved great successes. In the past year, over 40,000 bandits have been killed or captured, and even more bandits have surrendered to the democratic government. Currently, except for Wenxiang, Lingbao, and Shanxian counties, the entire region has been liberated, social order is increasingly stable, and the people's enthusiasm for production has begun to rise.

Western Henan counties have historically been areas plagued by bandits, with banditry erupting frequently and never being eradicated. The reasons for this, in addition to the poor social system of the old society, high rents and heavy interest, harsh and numerous levies, warlord conflicts, and widespread disasters leading to rural bankruptcy and forcing some young people to take risks, were mainly because local landlords and bullies, exploiting their power, harbored bandits to dominate the peasants and rule their areas. Furthermore, the Kuomintang authorities and local warlords condoned their troops harming the people, incorporating bandit gangs into their ranks and granting them legal status. This subjected the tens of millions of people in Western Henan to the cruel rule of the trinity of officials, bandits, and bullies, suffering oppression and exploitation.

Since the People's Liberation Army re-entered the area in August 1947, the Kuomintang further strengthened and proliferated local bandit forces, coordinating with special agent organizations and utilizing mountainous terrain as a base to plot the destruction of the PLA's rear and continue to harm the people of Western Henan. To ensure the safety of the people's lives and property, the local democratic government mobilized the entire region's military and civilians to launch a powerful military suppression and political offensive against the bandits.

Last spring, the People's Liberation Army conducted suppression operations in the Funiu Mountains, annihilating over a thousand bandits in Qiaohuangzhuang and opening up the areas of Yilu Song (newly established county, comprising parts of Yi County, Lushan, and Song County), Nanzhao, Lushi, and Luanchuan. During the Wanxi Campaign last summer, the so-called Wanxi Tuan Dui – the Kuomintang bandit armed forces, boasting twelve security regiments – which Bai Chongxi was so proud of, suffered a devastating blow. Subsequently, in September, our local armed forces stormed the bandit lair of Baoduzhai (under the jurisdiction of Lushi County), killing the bandit leader Xie Runyu. Terrified by the might of our army, the bandits no longer dared to stubbornly resist based on their strongholds and disintegrated. Incomplete statistics show that the region engaged in 1,275 battles, large and small, throughout the year, killing over 14,900 Kuomintang bandit troops, capturing over 26,600 alive, seizing 382 warhorses, mortars, 60mm guns, small cannons (59), grenade launchers (14), light and heavy machine guns (567), submachine guns (107), rifles and pistols (15,675), over 1.45 million rounds of ammunition of various types, and countless other military supplies.

Simultaneously with the military suppression, Party, government, and civilian organizations in various parts of Western Henan launched extensive political offensives, publicizing the victorious situation of the Liberation War and the various policies of the Communist Party and the democratic government. They also mobilized and organized various forces to carry out disintegration work, such as persuading the family members of bandits to urge their fathers, brothers, and sons who had become bandits to return home, and using surrendered bandits to persuade those who had not surrendered to turn themselves in. As a result, the bandits became increasingly shaken and divided, surrendering their weapons, registering, repenting, and requesting to perform meritorious service to atone for their crimes. In Yuxian County alone, over 500 bandits surrendered their weapons and repented in September last year.

In October last year, Zhengzhou, Kaifeng, and Nanyang were liberated one after another. Under the shock of our victories, the bandit ranks disintegrated further, with even some important figures of the bandit puppet regime automatically surrendering. According to incomplete statistics from six counties, including Nanyang and Nanzhao in the Sixth District, 2,660 bandit regimental and battalion commanders and below were won over in November last year alone.

In addition to adopting a lenient policy to release coerced followers who repented, some extremely wicked elements were also suppressed, which greatly boosted the morale of the masses, and the bandits became even more shaken and disintegrated. For example, An Jinsheng, the extremely wicked deputy commander of the puppet Xuchang Security Regiment, was tried by the people's court and executed with the approval of the government, resulting in over a hundred bandits coming to register their repentance within five days. Similarly, Xi Ziyou, a habitual bandit in Yuxian County who had harmed over three thousand lives in his lifetime, was publicly tried and executed, greatly pleasing the people, and scattered bandits flocked to surrender.

In some areas, those released coerced followers were educated on the comparison of strength between the enemy and us, breaking their fear of habitual bandits and bullies, allowing them to truly repent and live a law-abiding life. The democratic government of Lin’nan South District convened a symposium for bandits who had washed their hands and returned home. At the meeting, they spoke of the oppression they had suffered from bandit leaders in the bandit ranks and the inhuman lives they had lived, repenting their past mistakes and expressing their determination to repent and start anew. After the meeting, they assisted the government in investigating bandit activities and disintegrating bandits, achieving considerable results.

In carrying out the political offensive, some areas unilaterally implemented a lenient policy, pursuing numerical achievements, being lenient without suppression, and simply pursuing the number of bandits won over to return home for the sake of winning them over, without organizing and mobilizing the masses to carry out a mass anti-bandit movement. Therefore, some bandits falsely repented to steal legitimate status, returned to their villages to continue oppressing the masses, and some ringleaders were not punished as they deserved. Some remnants of bandits remained scattered and hidden in the border areas (junctions of two or three counties or districts), waiting for an opportunity to cause trouble.

The CCP Committee of the region is now mobilizing the masses to launch a large-scale anti-bandit and anti-bully movement to further eradicate banditry and stabilize people's livelihoods.

　　结合政攻坚决进行清剿
  　豫西剿匪获得很大成绩
    一年来毙俘土匪四万余人
    【新华社中原卅一日电】由于坚决进行军事清剿并结合相当规模的政治攻势，正确执行了“首恶必办，胁从不究，有功者奖”的方针，加以全国各战场胜利的影响　豫西解放区的剿匪工作已获得很大成绩，一年来共击毙与俘虏土匪四万余人，更有许多土匪向民主政府投诚自首。现全区除阌乡、灵宝、陕县外，已全部解放，社会秩序日趋稳定，人民生产情绪开始提高。豫西各县素为多匪之区，历年匪患蜂起，迄未肃清。其原因除了由于旧社会社会制度不良，高租重利，苛杂繁重，军阀混战，灾祸遍地，以至农村破产，农民无以为生，有些青壮年被迫挺而走险而外，主要是因为地方上的土豪劣绅，利用权势，豢养土匪，借以统治农民，称霸一方，而国民党当局与地方军阀又纵兵殃民，对成股土匪收编加委，给以合法地位，这样就使豫西地区千万人民在官、匪、霸三位一体的残酷统治下，备受压榨欺凌。该区自一九四七年八月人民解放军再度进入以后，国民党便更加强与繁殖地方土匪武装，配合特务组织，利用山地作基础，阴谋破坏解放军后方，继续祸害豫西人民。当地民主政府为保障人民生命财产安全，乃动员全区军民向土匪展开强大的军事清剿和政治攻势。去春，解放军于伏牛山区进行清剿，在侨黄庄歼匪千余，开辟了伊鲁嵩（新设县　伊县、鲁山、嵩县各一部）、南召、卢氏、滦川等地区。去夏宛西战役中，又将白崇禧所夸耀的所谓宛西团队该区——国民党土匪武装十二个保安团以歼灭性打击。接着，我地方武装于九月间一举攻入土匪巢穴抱犊砦（卢氏县属），击毙匪首谢润玉。土匪慑于我军威力，再不敢恃险顽抗，纷纷瓦解。仅据不完全统计，该区全年共大小战斗一千二百七十五次，击毙国民党土匪部队一万四千九百余名，生俘二万六千六百余名，缴获战马三八二匹，迫击炮、六零小炮、小炮五十九门，掷弹筒十四个，轻重机枪五百六十七挺，手提机枪一百零七支，长短枪一万五千六百七十五支，各种枪炮弹一百四十五万余发，及其他军用品无算。与军事清剿同时，豫西各地党政民开展了广泛的政治攻势，宣传解放战争胜利形势和共产党、民主政府的各种政策，并动员和组织各种力量进行瓦解工作，如通过土匪家属规劝其充当土匪的父兄子弟回家，利用已投诚的土匪劝说未投降的土匪自首等等。于是，土匪日益动摇分化，纷纷缴械登记悔过，要求立功赎罪，仅禹县一地去年九月份即有土匪五百余缴枪悔过。去年十月郑州、开封、南阳相继解放，在我胜利震撼下，土匪内部更形成土崩瓦解，连某些匪伪重要分子亦自动投案，仅六分区南阳、南召等六县不完全统计，去年十一月份即争取瓦解土匪团营长以下二千六百六十人。各地除采取宽大政策释放了悔过的胁从分子外，同时镇压了一些罪大恶极分子，群众大为振奋，土匪更动摇解体，如罪大恶极之伪许昌保安团副团长安金声，经人民法庭审判并经政府批准处决后，五天内即有百余土匪前来登记悔过。又如一生残害三千多条人命的禹县惯匪席子猷，经公审伏法后，人心大快，散匪纷纷来归。部分地区对释放之胁从分子进行关于敌我斗争力量对比的教育，打破他们对惯匪恶霸之恐惧，真正悔过自新，守法安业。临南南区民主政府召集已经洗手回家的土匪开座谈会，会上他们倾诉在土匪队伍中所受匪首的压迫以及所过的非人生活，痛悔前非，表示决心悔过自新。会后就帮助政府调查匪情，瓦解土匪，收到不少效果。在开展政治攻势中，有些地区片面执行宽大政策，追求数字成绩，只宽大而不镇压，单纯追求争取土匪回家的数字，为争取而争取，而没有组织发动群众，开展群众性的反匪运动，故有些匪徒以假悔过窃取合法地位回庄活动，继续欺压群众，少数首恶分子也未受到应得之惩办，有的残匪仍分散隐蔽于结合部（两三县或区之交界处）待机作乱。该区中共党委为进一步根绝匪患，安定民生，现正发动群众开展大规模的反匪反恶霸运动。
