Xinhua News Agency, East China, 26th: The People's Liberation Army stationed in Linhuaiguan City on the Tianjin-Pukou Railway is implementing the policy of protecting national industry and commerce and protecting merchants' goods. Before the arrival of the People's Liberation Army, merchants residing in transportation companies and commercial firms in the city such as Guanghui, Changyong, Hehua, Yonghua, Yuanda, Dachang, and Yuntai fled to Nanjing and Shanghai due to the war. Of the 5,500 bags of soybeans (200 jin per bag) and more than 400 bags of tobacco leaves (200 jin per bag) they had stockpiled at the station, more than 4,000 bags were looted and sold by the fleeing Kuomintang bandit troops. On January 20th, after the People's Liberation Army entered the city and discovered these materials, they immediately sent troops to the station to take custody of the remaining 1,338 bags of soybeans and 83 bags of tobacco leaves. On the 6th of this month, all these materials were handed over to the aforementioned commercial firms and transportation companies for safekeeping, guaranteeing that they would be returned to their original owners upon their return.
