Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 13th: Moscow broadcast on the 6th: The European Communist Information Bureau's organ, "For Lasting Peace and People's Democracy," recently published an article entitled "The Victory of Chinese Democracy," which stated:

　　"In the past three months, the Chinese People's Liberation Army has achieved brilliant victories: liberating the huge industrial and cultural centers of Tianjin and Beiping, advancing on Nanjing, and annihilating more than one million officers and soldiers of the Chiang army. Now, the entire Northeast, almost the entire North China and East China, have been freed from the shackles of feudal and colonial oppression and have embarked on the road of building a new, independent, and democratic China. The increasingly rapid collapse of the Kuomintang system has forced the Chiang Kai-shek group to seek ways that they and their American patrons believe can still save them. This is the Kuomintang's peace offensive, Chiang Kai-shek's departure from Nanjing, and the Kuomintang government's agreement to begin negotiations on the basis of conditions put forward by the Communist Party. The isolation of the manipulative Kuomintang upper echelons is deepening. At the same time, all patriotic and democratic forces in China have united and rallied around the Communist Party. They want to free their motherland permanently from imperialist oppression. In their published declaration, fifty-five prominent representatives of Chinese democratic parties declared: The Chinese people's revolution is against imperialism, feudalism, and bureaucratic capitalism. If these obstacles are not completely eradicated, then no real peace can be established in reality or in name. We must ruthlessly smash the peace offensive launched by Chiang Kai-shek and American imperialism. The people's democratic dictatorship should include representatives of a broad range of the people, but it does not tolerate the embryos of counter-revolution. The Chinese people hope to rapidly lay the foundation for lasting democratic peace, which is a condition for the revitalization and construction of the Chinese people. Mao Zedong, Chairman of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China, representing the will of the Chinese people, pointed out in his reply to Chiang Kai-shek's "peace" proposal: The Chinese People's Liberation Army has sufficient strength and reason to completely annihilate the remaining armed forces of the Kuomintang reaction government in the near future. However, in order to bring the war to a swift end, the Chinese Communist Party is still willing to conduct peace negotiations with the Kuomintang. The CCP also put forward eight conditions: punishing war criminals; abolishing the Kuomintang's past legal system; reorganizing all reactionary troops according to democratic principles; confiscating bureaucratic capital; reforming the land system; abolishing traitorous treaties, etc. The eight conditions put forward by the Communist Party of China have become a program for the masses of the people to struggle for peace, giving a fatal blow to the political tricks played by the Chiang Kai-shek group and its American masters. The Chinese people's struggle for peace, democracy, freedom, and independence is not yet complete, but the day of its completion is not far away. The glorious victory of the Chinese people, led by the heroic Communist Party, has not only shattered the American plan to enslave China and turn China into a strategic base for aggression, but also given a strong impetus to the liberation struggles of all colonial peoples. The democratic strength of China clearly confirms the truth that the people who have recognized their own strength are invincible."

  　赞扬中国民主的胜利         
    中共八项条件成为人民斗争纲领
    【新华社陕北十三日电】莫斯科六日广播：欧洲共产党情报局机关刊物“争取持久和平与人民民主”顷发表题为“中国民主的胜利”的论文称：
    最近三个月来，中国人民解放军获得了辉煌灿烂的胜利：解放了巨大的工业和文化中心——天津、北平，进逼南京，并且歼灭了蒋军一百多万官兵。现在，在整个东北，差不多整个华北和华东，都解除了封建和殖民地压迫的锁链，走上了建立新的独立民主中国的道路。国民党制度之日益加快的崩溃，迫使蒋介石集团去寻找他们及其美国庇护者认为还能挽救他们的那些方法，这就是国民党的和平攻势，蒋介石离开南京的事件，以及国民党政府同意在由共产党提出之条件的基础上着手进行谈判。玩弄手腕的国民党上层集团的孤立愈益加深了。同时，在共产党的周围，已联合与团结起中国的一切爱国和民主力量。他们要使自己的祖国永久摆脱帝国主义的压迫。中国民主党派的五十五名著名代表在其公布的宣言中声称：中国人民革命是反对帝国主义、反对封建与官僚资本主义的，如果这些障碍不被彻底铲除的话，那么，无论在实际上和在名义上都不能树立任何真实的和平，我们必需无情的粉碎蒋介石和美帝国主义发起的和平攻势。人民民主的专政应当包括广泛的民众的代表，可是，他不容纳反革命的胚胎。中国人民希望急速地奠定持久的民主的和平，它是中国人民之复兴与建设的条件。中国共产党中央委员会主席毛泽东代表中国人民大众的意向，在其对蒋介石的“和平”建议的答复中指出：中国人民解放军具有充分的力量和理由，在最近的将来彻底歼灭国民党反动政府武装力量的残部，然而，为求战争的迅速完结，中国共产党仍表示愿意和国民党进行和平谈判。中共并提出八项条件：惩办战争罪犯；废除国民党历来的法统；按照民主原则改编一切反动军队；没收官僚资本；改革土地制度；取消卖国条约等。中国共产党提出的八项条件，成了人民大众为和平斗争的纲领，对于蒋介石集团及美国主人所玩弄的政治手腕，给了致命的打击。中国人民为和平民主与自由独立的斗争还没有完成，可是，它离完成的日子已经不远了。以英勇的共产党为首的中国人民的光辉胜利，不但打破了奴役中国与把中国变成作为侵略之用的战略基地的美国计划，而且对一切殖民地人民的解放斗争给了强有力的推动。中国民主的力量显明地证实这种真理：已认识了自己本身力量的人民，是不可战胜的。
