Xinhua News Agency, Northeast, 15th -- The Northeast countryside is now actively carrying out preparations for spring production. Due to last year's bumper harvest and the widespread development of winter sideline production, coupled with the conscientious implementation of directives to protect and develop draught animals in various localities, farmers are actively increasing their purchases of carts, horses, and farm tools. Zhaoyuan County in Nenjiang Province, with income from sideline occupations such as fishing, hunting, salt boiling, alkali boiling, weaving, and mat making, has increased its holdings by more than 1,260 horses, 380 head of cattle, 84 mules and donkeys, and 76 carts. In addition, many bean cakes and farm tools have been purchased. Shulan County in Jilin Province has seen an increase of 6,000 head of draught animals in the past year, thanks to appropriately raising horse labor prices, resolving fodder difficulties, and reasonably distributing war service burdens, boosting farmers' enthusiasm for raising horses. According to incomplete statistics, farmers in Liaobei Province have already transferred and purchased more than 20,600 draught animals and converted more than 17,500 cattle and horses used for pulling carts or other purposes into draught animals. It is estimated that, except for areas ravaged by the Kuomintang bandit troops and natural disasters, most areas in the province can achieve one head of livestock per household. The province has also decided to issue draught animal certificates, declare private ownership rights, adjust burdens, and at the same time carry out draught animal epidemic prevention and horse breed improvement work. The provincial governments and the Northeast Bank are continuing to organize agricultural production loans (including in-kind and cash) to vigorously assist farmers in spring plowing. The Liaobei branch of the Northeast Bank alone has allocated 5,500 tons of grain as draught animal loans, and the Heilongjiang Provincial branch has also released loans of 30 billion yuan. The Northeast Bank office in Gushan County, Andong Province, prepared 30,000 ploughshares and 500,000 jin of fertilizer last autumn as part of this year's early loan distribution. Significant achievements have also been made in accumulating fertilizer and delivering manure in various regions. Jilin Province plans to apply 25 large carts of manure per hectare (10 mu) of land, striving to apply manure to 489,000 hectares of land. In Kuandian County, Andong Province, from last autumn to the end of January this year, more than 91,000 carts of manure have been accumulated, and it is estimated that another 50,000 carts of manure can be accumulated before spring plowing, striving to apply 40 carts of manure per hectare of land, a twofold increase compared with last year.

　　东北积极准备春耕
  　农民争购车马农具
    【新华社东北十五日电】东北农村现正积极开展春季生产的准备工作。由于去年丰收与广泛开展了冬季副业生产，加之各地认真执行保护与发展耕畜指示，农民乃纷纷增购车马及农具。嫩江省肇源县以从事渔猎、熬盐、熬碱、纺织、编席等副业收入，即增置一千二百六十余匹马、三百八十余头牛、八十四匹骡驴与七十六辆车，此外并买入许多豆饼及农具。吉林省舒兰县一年来由于适当提高马工价，解决了草料困难及合理负担战勤的结果，农民养马情绪提高，现已增加耕畜六千头。辽北省的农民据不完全统计，已调剂和购买了两万零六百余匹耕畜，并将拉车或作其他使用的牛马一万七千五百余匹改作耕畜之用。估计全省除受国民党匪军蹂躏及自然灾害地区外，一般地区可作到每户一头牲口。该省并决定发耕畜证，宣布私有权，调剂负担，同时进行耕畜防疫和改良马种等工作。各省政府与东北银行为大力协助农民春耕，正继续举办农业生产贷款（包括实物和现款）。仅东北银行辽北分行即拨粮五千五百吨作为耕畜贷款，合江省分行也拨放贷款三百亿元。安东省孤山县东北银行办事处则于去秋即准备了铧子三万条、肥田粉五十万斤作为今年提早发放贷款之一部。在积肥送粪上，各地也获得了不少成绩。吉林省计划每垧（十亩）地上粪二十五大车，争取四十八万九千垧地上粪。安东省宽甸县自去年秋后截至今年一月底止已积粪九万一千余车，预计春耕前还能积粪五万车，争取每垧地上粪四十车，较去年增加两倍。
