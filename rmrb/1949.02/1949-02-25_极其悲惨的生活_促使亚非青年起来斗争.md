　　Extremely Miserable Lives
　　Prompt Asian and African Youth to Rise Up in Struggle
　　【Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 23rd】What is it that motivates the youth of colonies and dependent countries to wage a heroic and unyielding struggle for liberation? Many letters recently sent by youth from Asia and Africa to the Soviet Youth Anti-Fascist Committee answer this question. According to TASS, Moscow, 20th: These letters state that they struggle because they are forced to live unbearable lives. Young workers in colonial countries work ten to fourteen hours a day, but their wages are insufficient to sustain life. In Algiers, French North Africa, the wages of adult workers are already extremely low, but the wages of young workers are twenty to forty percent less than those of adults. In Morocco, French North Africa, young workers labor all day long, yet their wages are not even half of the minimum living expenses. In colonial and dependent countries, there are no holidays or weekly days off throughout the year, and there is no social insurance in case of injury, illness, or death at work. The lives of young agricultural workers are nothing but starvation and disease.
　　Young men and women in colonial and dependent countries are deprived of the freedom to vote and be elected. In India, only thirteen percent of the residents participate in elections. In the last election in Burma, only half of the voters participated. In Malaya, the people have never had the right to vote. In Egypt, Turkey, and Iran, the right to vote is restricted by various regulations. In these countries, women are deprived of the right to vote.
　　Young people in colonial countries cannot even receive elementary education. Ninety percent of the people in India are illiterate. India, with a population of 400 million, has only eighteen universities, and all the courses in these universities are taught in English. Among the youth of the Malayan working class, only one percent has received some education, and Malaya does not even have a single university. In South Africa, fifty percent of the children must leave school at a very young age because they cannot afford to live.
　　The living conditions of young workers in colonial and dependent countries are simply intolerable. In the rural areas of India, Burma, Malaya, Egypt, and Iran, there are no hospitals or doctors. In Morocco, there is only one nurse for every 50,000 residents. In India, Morocco, Algiers, and Tunisia in French North Africa, the average life expectancy of residents does not exceed twenty-five to twenty-seven years.

### 极其悲惨的生活　促使亚非青年起来斗争

　　极其悲惨的生活
  　促使亚非青年起来斗争
    【新华社陕北二十三日电】什么东西促使殖民地和附属国的青年进行英勇不屈的解放斗争呢？亚非两洲青年们最近寄给苏联青年反法西斯委员会的许多信件，解答了这个问题。据塔斯社莫斯科二十日讯：这些信写道：他们之所以要斗争，是因为他们被迫过着无法忍受的生活。殖民地国家的青年工人，每天工作十小时到十四小时，但是，工资却无法维持生活。在法属北非的阿尔及尔，成年工人的工资本来已经极其低微，但是青年工人的工资比成年人还要少百分之二十到四十。在法属北非的摩洛哥，青年工人整日劳动，工资却不够最低生活费的一半。在殖民地国家及附属国家内，终年没有假期，没有星期休假，如果在工作中受伤、患病或死亡，也没有社会保险。青年农业工人的生活，无非只是挨饿和害病。
    殖民地国家及附属国家内的青年男女，是被剥夺了自由投票权和被选举权的。在印度，只有百分之十三的居民参加选举。在缅甸上届的选举中，只有一半的选民参加了投票。在马来亚，人民是从来没有选举权的。在埃及、土耳其和伊朗，选举权受着各色各样规定的限制。在这些国家里，妇女是被剥夺了选举权的。
    殖民地国家的青年，甚至连小学教育都受不到。印度人民的百分之九十是文盲。拥有人口四亿人口的印度，只有十八所大学，这些大学的各种课程，全是用英语讲授的。马来亚工人阶级的青年中，只有百分之一受过一些教育，马来亚连一所大学也没有。在南非，百分之五十的儿童必须在年纪很小时就离开学校，原因是生活无着。
    殖民地与附属国家青年工人的居住状况，简直是令人无法容忍的。在印度、缅甸、马来亚、埃及及伊朗的农村中，是没有医院和医生的。在摩洛哥，每五万居民中只有一名看护。在印度、摩洛哥、阿尔及尔及法属北非的突尼斯，居民的平均寿命都不超过二十五岁到二十七岁。
