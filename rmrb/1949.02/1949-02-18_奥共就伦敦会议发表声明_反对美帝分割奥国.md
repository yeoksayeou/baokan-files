　　Austrian Communist Party Issues Statement on London Conference
  　Opposing US Imperialist Partition of Austria
    Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 16th. Following the resumption of the meeting of the deputy foreign ministers of the Soviet Union, the United States, Britain, and France in London on the 9th to prepare for the Austrian peace treaty, TASS Vienna reported on the 13th: The Austrian Communist Party issued a statement declaring that Western countries are artificially creating complicated situations to make an agreement impossible. The statement pointed out that the United States wants to extend its occupation of Austria indefinitely and will strengthen its forces on Austrian territory. The current London talks are considered a pretext for concluding a separate "peace agreement" with the Austrian government if the conference ends without result. Concluding such a divisive peace treaty means dividing Austria in the same way as Germany was divided, and combining the economy of western Austria with the economy of the Anglo-American-occupied zone of Germany. This policy is naturally only supported by a minority in the leading group of the government. The Austrian Communist Party calls on the Austrian people to pay close attention to the London conference and do their utmost to fight for Austria's independence and unity.

　　奥共就伦敦会议发表声明
  　反对美帝分割奥国
    【新华社陕北十六日电】准备对奥和约的苏美英法外长助理会议于九日在伦敦复会后，据电通社维也纳十三日讯：奥地利共产党发表声明，宣称西方国家正人工地制造复杂情况，以使协议成为不可能。声明指出：美国想要无限延长其对奥国的占领，并将加强其在奥国领土上的力量。目前的伦敦谈判，被认为是如果会议无结果而终，就可以作为与奥国政府单独缔结“和平协定”的口实。缔结这样的分裂性和约，意味着将象分割德国那样分割奥地利，把西部奥国的经济与德国美英联合占领区的经济结合起来。这个政策，当然只有政府当领导集团中的少数人支持它。奥地利共产党号召奥地利人民密切注意伦敦会议，并竭尽全力为奥地利的独立与统一而战斗。
