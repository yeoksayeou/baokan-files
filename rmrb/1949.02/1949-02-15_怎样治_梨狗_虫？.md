    How to Cure "Pear Dog" Bugs?

    Editor:
    Luoyang Village in the fifth district of my county is famous for its pears. In the Machang area of ​​the village alone, there are five or six *qing* of pear orchards. In recent years, every time the buds sprout, there is a pest called "Pear Dog," which is white, hairy, and a little bigger than a wheat grain. After it eats the leaves, the pears don't bear fruit; after it crawls on the pears, the pears develop a hard skin. Every year, the masses catch and kill them, but they can't be cured, which greatly affects income. I don’t know if there is any cure or preventive measures for this insect? Please reply.

    Comrade Shahe Villager:
    "Pear Dog" is sometimes called "Little Tiger," but is usually called Pear Star Caterpillar, a major pest of pear trees. Its larvae overwinter in the bark of tree trunks or old branches. The treatment is to scrape off the bark of pear trees that have been infested with Pear Star Caterpillars in the winter of that year and burn it, so that the larvae can be burned to death at the same time. After they are found on the leaves, people can be organized to catch and kill them. The above are the old methods of the masses. If done well, they can achieve considerable results. In addition, we are preparing to experiment with spraying DDT liquid to kill them this year. If this spraying method is successful, the elimination of Pear Star Caterpillars will be much easier in the future.

### 怎样治“梨狗”虫？

专栏：询问与答复

　　怎样治“梨狗”虫？编辑同志：
    我县五区洛阳村产梨甚有名，仅该村马场一地即有梨树地五、六顷。近几年来每到发芽时就有一种害虫叫“梨狗”，色白，有毛，比麦粒大一些，吃叶后梨即不结；从梨上爬过后，梨即生硬皮。每年群众捉打也治不了，影响收入很大，不知此虫有无治法和预防办法？请答复。
    　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　沙河县政府村民沙河村民同志：
    “梨狗”有的地方叫小老虎，通常叫梨星毛虫，为梨树的一大害虫。其幼虫在树干或老树枝的树皮里越冬。治法可把发生过梨星毛虫的梨树，在当年冬天，把树皮刮下烧掉，幼虫就可同时烧死；在叶上发现之后，可组织起来捉打。以上是群众旧有的老办法，做得好的话，可以收到相当效果的。另外，我们今年准备试验用滴滴涕（Ｄ·Ｄ·Ｔ·）液喷杀，这一药剂喷杀法如获得成功，今后梨星毛虫的除治就省力多了。 　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　 华北人民政府农业部
