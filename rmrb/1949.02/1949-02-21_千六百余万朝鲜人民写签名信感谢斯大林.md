Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 19th. According to TASS, Moscow, 16th: At the time of the Soviet army's complete withdrawal from North Korea, the moving act of more than sixteen million people out of the thirty million population of North and South Korea writing signed letters to thank Stalin demonstrated how much the Korean people love the bulwark of world peace - the Soviet Union. The signature campaign to write a letter to Stalin, initiated by workers at the "Sadon Vol" (transliteration) factory in Pyongyang, spread throughout Korea from October to December last year. The people of South Korea under American occupation, regardless of the local authorities' suppression and terror tactics, actively participated in the discussion and signing of the letter to Stalin. Farmers from various provinces in South Korea, residents of Seoul and other places, residents of Jeju Island, and residents of the South Korean mountain guerrilla areas all signed. A total of 16,767,680 people in the entire Korea signed, including 9,940,000 residents of South Korea. The signature books for this letter have filled more than thirty boxes. The Korean people's letter to Stalin has recently been transported to Moscow. The full text of the letter is embroidered on silk. All Moscow newspapers published the full text of the letter on the 16th.
