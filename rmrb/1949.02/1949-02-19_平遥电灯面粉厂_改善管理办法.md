　　Pingyao Electric Light Flour Mill
　　Improvement Measures

　　[Jinzhong Electric] Workers at the Pingyao City Electric Light and Flour Mill have accelerated labor efficiency, and both the quantity and quality of production have improved. The mill currently has a 128 (KW) generator and a 100-horsepower prime mover, along with three steel grinding stones (two in operation). Since liberation last July, in addition to providing electricity for the city for five hours every night, the remaining time has been used to grind flour for the front lines. However, during the initial takeover period, due to a lack of experience in leadership and management, coupled with dilapidated machinery, the workers' production enthusiasm and skills could not be fully utilized. Therefore, before October of last year, the average output was only 10 to 11 bags of flour per hour. Later, after the leadership reviewed and researched the previous stage of work, they strengthened the study of current events and policies among the workers to raise their class consciousness. At the same time, they resolutely implemented systems for work, study, rewards, and meetings. Staff and workers jointly organized an inspection committee to promote production. From December onwards, production became more organized and planned. Each unit and individual made production plans and specifically addressed individual difficulties. A temporary standard of 15 bags of flour per hour was set, with unified leadership and the establishment of close ties between departments, resulting in initial achievements. Flour production increased from 11 bags per hour in the past to a maximum of 21 bags, with an average output of 15 to 16 bags. The amount of lubricating oil and sesame oil used by the electricity department in December was reduced by 19.5% compared to November. The voltage increased from 210 in the past to 250-300. In addition to completing its own tasks, the repair department also took on external odd jobs. In the past six months, the mill has ground a total of 1,187,500 jin of wheat, supplying the front lines. Adding other income, the total revenue, after purchasing 200 tons of coal and paying wages, was used to buy wheat. It is estimated that the current inventory of finished products and raw materials can meet the needs for one month.

　　平遥电灯面粉厂
  　改善管理办法
    【晋中电】平遥市电灯、面粉厂工人加速劳动效率，生产数量、质量均有提高。该厂现有一二八（ＫＷ）发电机及一百马力原动机各一部，钢磨三盘（开动两盘），自去年七月解放后，每晚除五个钟头放电供全市灯用外，其余时间均磨面粉供应前线。但在开始接收时期，由于领导管理方面没有经验，再加上机器破烂，未能充分发挥工人的生产积极性和技能。因此，在去年十月份以前，平均每小时仅磨面粉十至十一袋，后经领导上对前一段工作进行了检讨与研究，一面加强领导职工的时事、政策学习，提高工人的阶级觉悟；一面坚决贯彻工作、学习、奖励、会议等制度，职员、工人共同组织了检查委员会，推动生产。从十二月份起，生产便较有组织、有计划，各单位及个人均作了生产计划，并具体解决了各个人的困难。暂定每小时以十五袋麦粉为产量标准，统一领导与建立各部间的密切联系，因而获得了初步成绩。面粉产量每小时由过去的十一袋增至最高二十一袋，平均产量十五至十六袋。电力部所用之机油及麻油，十二月比十一月份节省百分之十九点五。电压由过去二一零增到二五零至三零零。修理部除完成本身任务外，并向外做零活，半年来该厂共磨麦子一百一十八万七千五百余斤，供应了前方，再加其他营养，整个收入除已买进二百吨炭及开支工资外，所余部分买进麦子，估计现所存成品、原料可供一月需用。
