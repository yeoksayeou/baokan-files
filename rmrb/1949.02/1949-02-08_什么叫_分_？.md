What is "Fen"?
To the Editor:
    In the "Resolution on the Current Tasks of the Chinese Workers' Movement" published on November 10th last year, Chapter III, Section 4, Item 5, Point 4, regarding the basis for wage calculation, North China uses "@" and Northeast uses "Fen." We do not know what "@" and "Fen" are, and how to calculate them? Greetings.
　　Reader Shen Ru, January 20th
Comrade Shen Ru: The "@" in North China and "Fen" in Northeast that you asked about are the units for wage calculation in the North China and Northeast liberated areas. The "@" was introduced in this newspaper on February 4th. Here, we will simply introduce the calculation method for "Fen," and you will understand the difference when you compare them.
    According to the regulations of the Northeast Administrative Committee, the value of each "Fen" in Northeast is as follows:
    A. Essential living necessities: Including 1.125 jin of grain, 0.1225 square feet of cloth, 0.025 jin of oil, 0.03 jin of salt, and 3.835 jin of coal, totaling 70% of the value of each "Fen."
    B. Secondary essential living necessities: Equal to 30% of the value of each "Fen," with the calculation standards and payment methods for the actual items explained as follows:
    (1) Calculation standards for the five types of actual items:
    Grain: Based on the average mixed grain of common sorghum rice, corn, and millet. In areas lacking sorghum rice and millet, corn is the standard.
    Cloth: Based on ordinary white cloth and calculated in square feet.
    Oil: Based on soybean oil.
    Salt: Based on ordinary edible salt.
    Coal: Based on ordinary household coal.
    (2) The five types of actual items used as wage standards are converted into currency at the prices or the value of each "Fen" announced monthly by the Wage Assessment Committee of the Northeast Industry Department. No actual items are directly paid, but the daily necessities of the families of all employees can be guaranteed quantitative distribution by cooperatives or supply stores.

　　什么叫“分”？编辑同志：
    去年十一月十日报上所登的“关于中国职工运动当前任务的决议”第三章第四节第五项第四点中关于工资计算的基础，华北为“＠”，东北为“分”，我们不知“＠”与“分”是什么？如何计算呢？敬礼
　　读者　申如　一月二十日申如同志：你问的华北的“＠”及东北的“分”，是华北和东北两解放区的工资计算的单位。关于＠已在二月四日本报介绍过了，这里单把“分”的计算法介绍一下，请你一对照，就会知道它的区别。
    东北的“分”计算法，按东北行政委员会规定，每“分”之值如下：
    甲、生活必需部分：包括粮一点一二五斤、布零点一二二五方尺，油零点零二五斤、盐零点零三斤、煤三点八三五斤，合计等于每“分”之值的百分之七十。
    乙、生活次要必需部分：等于每“分”之值的百分之三十，其中实物之计算标准及支付方法，说明如下：
    （一）五种实物之计算标准：
    粮：以普通高粱米、包米、小米之平均混合粮为标准，在缺乏高粱米，小米之地区，则以包米为标准。
    布：以普通白市布为标准，并规定用方尺计算。
    油：以大豆油为标准。
    盐：以普通食盐为标准。
    煤：以普通户用煤为标准。
    （二）作为工薪标准之五种实物，按东北工业部工薪考核委员会每月所公布之物价或每“分”之值，一律折合成货币支付，不直接支付任何实物，但各员工家属之日用必需品，可由合作社或供给商店保证定量配给。
