Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, February 25th: The Second Women's Congress of the Shaanxi-Gansu-Ningxia Border Region opened in Yan'an on January 26th and closed on February 11th, lasting half a month. Seventy-two representatives attended, including female workers, rural working women, female students, women from minority ethnic groups, women from the Kuomintang-controlled areas, family members of People's Liberation Army soldiers, as well as female staff and self-employed women engaged in economic, cultural, educational, artistic, childcare, and medical work, and female staff from various agencies in the Border Region. Ma Mingfang, Deputy Secretary of the Northwest Central Bureau of the Chinese Communist Party, and Yang Mingxuan, Vice Chairman of the Shaanxi-Gansu-Ningxia Border Region Government, attended the congress and delivered speeches. The congress held detailed discussions on the future direction of the women's movement in the Border Region, organizational forms, working methods, marriage issues, women cadre issues, and childcare work. It also drafted a plan to develop women's work among the Hui and Mongolian minority ethnic groups. Regarding the direction, the congress determined that in the old areas, the focus should be on mobilizing women to engage in production, combined with the struggle against feudal remnants and bad habits. In the new areas, the focus should be on mobilizing women against feudalism, closely integrated with production. Regarding organizational forms, the congress believes that women's representative conferences at all levels are the best way to connect with women. Their composition should include female workers, rural and urban working women, female students, and professional women. Regarding the methods of women's work, the congress pointed out that it must be closely integrated with current political tasks and various movements. Women workers should participate in general work, and at the same time, pay attention to mobilizing and organizing women to promote overall work. In the new areas, emphasis should be placed on carrying out propaganda and education among women, raising their awareness of the revolution, and mobilizing and organizing them to participate in mass movements in the new areas such as rent reduction, interest reduction, anti-local tyrant, and anti-spy movements, and production movements carried out on this basis. At the same time, attention should be paid to the special interests of women themselves, and help should be given to remove the feudal constraints suffered by women. Regarding the marriage issue, the representatives listed many facts from various places, indicating that arranged marriages, early marriages, and child bride systems that do not comply with the government's marriage laws still exist relatively commonly. The representatives unanimously pointed out that these feudal remnants and bad habits seriously affect and constrain rural production in the Border Region. This phenomenon must be eradicated. The congress suggested that the government adhere to the implementation of reasonable marriage regulations, instruct cadres at all levels to strictly abide by them, and call on all women workers in the Border Region to use various mass gatherings in various movements to publicize the harm of arranged marriages, child brides, and early marriages, explain the government's marriage laws and the principle of freedom of marriage, so that this constraint and pain can be gradually eliminated. The congress emphasized that in addition to strengthening their general political studies, female comrades must master a specialized skill and establish the determination to engage in a specialized career for life, and promote relevant women's work on the basis of doing a good job in their own professional work. The congress suggested promoting small-scale nurseries to solve the childcare problems of female cadres' children, and drafted a set of childcare regulations for the Border Region government's reference. Finally, the congress elected Hai Tao, Yang Zhifang, Bai Xi, Hao Mingzhu, Shuai Guang, Liu Jinying, Li Zhen, Zhao Feng, Zhang Zifang, Lu Zhiliang, Gao Minzhen, Lin Feng, Li Jing, and Liu Fang as the fourteen official representatives to the National Women's Congress by secret ballot. Zhang Zifang, Yang Zhifang and twenty-five others were elected as members of the Executive Committee of the Border Region Women's Federation. This congress also had some shortcomings, mainly that the Border Region Women's Federation and the local Women's Federations did not have enough self-criticism of past work, and there were relatively few introductions of various excellent work examples, so they failed to fully exchange successful experiences or lessons learned from failures in various places.

　　陕甘宁举行妇代会
    【新华社延安二十五日电】陕甘宁边区妇女第二届代表大会，于上月廿六日在延安开幕，历时半月，已于本月十一日闭幕。出席代表七十二人，包括女工、农村劳动妇女、女学生、少数民族妇女、国民党区妇女、人民解放军军人家属、以及从事经济、文化、教育、艺术、保育、医务等工作的女职员、女自由职业者和边区各机关中的女工作人员。中共西北中央局副书记马明芳，陕甘宁边区政府副主席杨明轩曾亲临大会讲话。大会对于边区今后妇女运动的方针，组织形式，工作方法，婚姻问题，妇女干部问题及保育工作等问题均有详尽讨论。并拟出了开展回蒙少数民族妇女工作的草案。关于方针，大会确定老区以发动妇女进行生产为主，并与反对封建残余恶习的斗争相结合。新区以发动妇女反封建为主，密切结合生产。关于组织形式：大会认为各级妇女代表会议是联系妇女群众最好的形式。其成份应该包括女工、农村及城市劳动妇女、女学生、职业妇女等。关于妇女工作的方法，大会指出必须与当前的政治任务及各项运动密切结合，妇女工作者应该参与一般的工作，同时，又要时刻注意发动与组织妇女群众以推动全盘工作。在新区应着重向妇女进行宣传教育，提高他们对革命的认识，发动和组织她们参加新区群众的减租减息、反恶霸、反特务等运动，及在这一基础上开展的生产运动，同时注意妇女本身的特殊利益，帮助解除妇女所受的封建束缚。关于婚姻问题，各代表列举了各地许多事实，说明不合政府婚姻法令的买卖婚姻、早婚、童养制度等仍旧比较普遍地存在。代表们一致指出这些封建残余恶习严重地影响和束缚着边区的农村生产。这种现象必须根除。大会建议政府坚持贯彻执行合理的婚姻条例，责成各级干部严格遵守，并号召边区全体妇女工作者在各种运动中利用各种群众集会，宣传买卖婚姻、童养媳、早婚的害处，讲解政府的婚姻法令和婚姻自由的原则，使这种束缚和痛苦能够逐渐消除。大会强调指出，女同志除了应该加强对于一般的政治学习以外，必须掌握一种专门技能，建立终身从事一项专门事业的决心，在作好自己业务工作的基础上来推动有关的妇女工作。大会建议推广小型托儿所，以解决女干部的孩子的保育问题，并拟订了保育条例草案提供边区政府参考。最后大会以不记名投票方式选出海涛、杨芝芳、白西、郝明珠、帅光、刘金英、李贞、赵锋、张子芳、路志亮、高敏珍、林枫、李静、刘芳十四人为出席全国妇女代表大会的正式代表。张子芳、杨芝芳等二十五人为边区妇女联合会执行委员。这次大会也有一些缺点，主要的是边区妇联会及各地妇联会对于过去工作的自我检讨还不够，对于各种优良工作范例的介绍也比较少，因此未能充分地交流各地成功的经验或失败的教训。
