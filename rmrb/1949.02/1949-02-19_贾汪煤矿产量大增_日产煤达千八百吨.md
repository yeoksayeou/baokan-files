Xinhua News Agency, Xuzhou, 17th. The famous Jiawang Coal Mine (located more than 90 li northeast of Xuzhou), after more than two months of active restoration, has seen its total daily coal production increase sharply from 300 tons to 1,800 tons. Although the mine was spared destruction and loss due to the full protection of its employees when it was first liberated, it had been shut down for nearly two months before liberation, resulting in many unrepaired coal pits. Therefore, when the democratic government first took over, the daily output was only 300 tons. With the gradual restoration of the mine shafts and the increasing enthusiasm of the miners for production, the mine's management agency issued a call for increased production in January, requesting that the daily output gradually increase from 300 tons to 1,500 tons, with January's output reaching 32,590 tons. After the plan was proposed, it was enthusiastically supported by the workers. The results of the implementation in January exceeded the original plan by more than 11.5 percent. In February, the management agency again proposed a call for a daily output of 2,000 tons, and the current daily output has reached 1,800 tons. It is expected that the monthly plan will be successfully completed. Under the leadership of the democratic government, the miners have established a new work attitude and launched a campaign to cherish machinery, and production efficiency has also greatly improved. Currently, the mine's management agency is actively paying attention to the workers' welfare measures. Emergency treatment stations have been added in the coal pits, and boilers have been set up to provide boiling water for the workers. Some wellheads have also been equipped with radios, so that workers can hear current affairs news during their leisure time. In addition, a workers' consumer cooperative has been organized.

　　贾汪煤矿产量大增
  　日产煤达千八百吨
    【新华社徐州十七日电】著名的贾汪煤矿（位于徐州东北九十余里）经两月余的积极恢复，共每日产煤量已由三百吨突增至一千八百吨。该矿初解放时，虽为员工全力保护而免受破坏和损失，但在解放前已停工近两月，致许多炭洞失修，故民主政府初接管时日产量仅及三百吨。随着矿坑的逐步修复和矿工们生产积极性的提高，该矿管理机关乃于一月份提出增产号召，要求每日产量由三百吨逐渐增至一千五百吨，一月份产量达到三万二千五百九十万吨。计划提出后，得到工人们热烈拥护。一月份执行结果，已超过原计划的百分之十一点五强。二月份内，管理机关又提出日产两千吨的号召，现每日产量已达一千八百吨，预计该月计划即可顺利完成。该矿在民主政府领导下，矿工们已建立了新的劳动态度，并展开了爱护机器运动，生产效率亦大大提高。现该矿管理机关，正积极注意工人的福利措施。炭井下已增设急疗所，设有烧水锅炉，为工人供给开水，有的井口上并按设了收音机，工余的时候工人可听到时事消息，此外还组织了工人消费合作社。
