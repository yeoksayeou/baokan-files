　　Jingxing Coal Mine Company
  　Developing Worker Welfare Undertakings
  　Inadequate Implementation of Labor Insurance Regulations
    [Our Dispatch] The Jingxing Coal Mine Company is actively developing employee welfare programs, enabling all mine workers to receive labor insurance for the first time. Since the company was formally established in February of last year, it has allocated 1,954,117,600 yuan (border region currency, same below) for insurance funds, medical expenses, and cultural and educational expenses. The "Provisional Measures for Pensions and Relief" promulgated by the company stipulates many labor insurance regulations: If an employee is killed in an accident at work, or dies during treatment, a coffin, burial expenses, and a pension will be issued; for families of injured or deceased employees who still have difficulties, subsidies will be issued as appropriate; employees who are ill for more than two months and have not recovered will be given living allowances as appropriate; retirees will be paid retirement fees; and family members or relatives of employees who die on the job will be eligible for relief and resettlement. For the health of employees, the company has established two hospitals and one clinic, where employees can receive free treatment if they are sick, and in addition to free treatment, they also receive wages if they are injured at work. Since the repair and construction of workers' dormitories last year, most workers' families have two rooms and a kitchen, no longer crowded into workshops lacking sunlight and air like in the past. There are four bathhouses in the mining area, and employees can bathe once every day or two. In terms of culture and education, a workers' night school, an employee night school, and two employee children's schools have been established, totaling five or six hundred people; there are two libraries with over a thousand books, subscriptions to the People's Daily and Shijiazhuang Daily (over eighty copies), two theater troupes, and a club, publishing the Miner's News and blackboards, etc. However, there are still some shortcomings in welfare work. Due to the Welfare Committee's (composed of the Party, administration, and trade union) insufficient attention to welfare work, some areas have not assumed their due responsibilities. First, the trade union has not widely publicized the labor insurance regulations among the broad masses of employees, and many people still do not understand the labor insurance regulations, thus reducing the political significance of labor insurance. Second, the trade union received a total of 889,600,068 yuan in labor insurance premiums last year. After deducting 5,227,000 yuan for pensions and 1,379,000 yuan for living allowances, there is still 819,144,400 yuan remaining. Such a large amount of funds has not been well used for employee welfare, and only about 80,000,000 yuan has been used to set up two cooperatives that have not been able to serve employees well. Due to unclear management policies, they still only sell imported cloth, cigarettes, and alcohol, while necessary daily necessities are often in short supply. Employees are very dissatisfied. The trade union has also failed to pay attention to the urgent problem of organizing the families of employees to engage in production; on the contrary, it has lent 30,000,000 yuan at interest to private merchants.
    The above-mentioned deviations urgently need to be inspected and improved.

### 井陉煤矿公司　兴办工人福利事业　执行劳动保险条例不深入

　　井陉煤矿公司
  　兴办工人福利事业
  　执行劳动保险条例不深入
    【本报讯】井陉煤矿公司积极兴办职工福利事业，使全矿职工第一次获得劳动保险。自去年二月公司正式成立以来，已拨出保险金及医药文教费十九亿五千四百一十一万七千六百元（边币、下同）。在公司颁布的“暂行抚恤救济办法”中，规定许多劳动保险条例：职工因工作遇险，立时殒命，或者治疗中殒命者，发给棺木、埋葬费与抚恤金；对于伤亡的职工家庭仍有困难者，酌情发给补助费；职工病期在两个月以上未愈者，酌情发给生活补助费；年老退休者，发给退休费；职工因工作死亡后，其家属或遗族可获救济与安置。公司为了职工的健康，设立医院二个，治疗所一个，职工病了，可免费治疗，因工作受伤了，除免费治疗，还发给工资。自去年修理和建筑了工人宿舍以后，大部分的工人家庭有两间房子，一间厨房，再不象过去许多人挤在缺乏阳光和空气的工房里。矿区有四个澡塘，职工一两天可以洗澡一次。文化教育方面，设立了工人夜校，职工夜校，二个职工子弟学校，共五六百人；二个图书馆，藏书千余册，订人民日报及石家庄日报八十余份，有剧团二个，并设俱乐部，出版矿工报与黑板报等。但是，福利工作尚存在一些缺点。由于福利委员会（由党、行政及职工总会组成）对于福利工作重视不够，有些地方没有负起应有的责任。第一、职工总会对于劳动保险条例没有普遍的在广大职工里宣传，很多人还不了解劳动保险条例，因此降低了劳动保险的政治意义。第二、职工总会去年共收到劳动保险金八亿八千九百六十万零六千八百元，除支出抚恤费五千二百二十七万元和生活补助费一千三百七十九万元，尚存八亿一千九百一十四万四千元。这样雄厚的资金，没有很好运用到职工福利事业上，仅拿出约八万万元办了两个未能很好为职工服务的合作社。由于经营方针不明确，至今仍只出卖洋布、烟、酒等消费品，必需的日用品则时常供不应求。职工非常不满。对于急待解决的组织职工家属生产问题也未引起职工总会的注意；相反以三千万元出息借给私商。
    上述偏向急待检查改进。
