　　Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 26th. Dentsu News Agency commentator Simon commented on Eisenhower's accession to power on the 20th, stating:

　　At the height of the "North Atlantic Treaty" negotiations, General Eisenhower's appointment as Truman's military advisor and chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff (Army, Navy, and Air Force) marked the beginning of a new phase in American politics: the "Marshall Plan" has been openly transformed into a tool for military preparation. (Note: Eisenhower was originally the Chief of Staff of the U.S. Army, retired in October of last year, and became the President of Columbia University. On January 11th of this year, he was appointed to the aforementioned new positions by Truman.)

　　The most important tasks facing Eisenhower in his new position are: to force Congress to agree to significantly increase military appropriations as part of this transformation plan. Secondly, faced with the deepening contradictions between Western European countries—which are far greater than have been revealed so far—Eisenhower has to spur the parliaments of Western European countries to comply. Thirdly, he will have to alleviate the deep-seated fears of the American people that American foreign policy is increasingly subject to purely military considerations.

　　In fact, it can be said that an "Eisenhower Plan" is replacing the "Marshall Plan," and the latter will have to face a huge reduction in "aid" funds in order to serve as funding for the Western European militarization plan.

　　Vandenberg recently stated this point in his speech to the Senate Foreign Relations Committee. He said: "Before the Senate plenary session discusses the European Recovery Program, the government must determine the exact amount of military aid needed (for Western European countries)."

　　American foreign policy has changed from Roosevelt's advocacy of cooperation with the Soviet Union to "Trumanism." However, neither Truman nor any of his cabinet members had enough prestige among the American people to navigate the first phase of the plan to dominate the world. Therefore, they came up with the idea of entrusting foreign policy to Marshall. His task was to use the "Marshall Plan" to subordinate Western European countries to the United States, force them to align with American foreign policy, and accept the idea of an anti-Soviet and anti-people's democracy military bloc.

　　However, there were several major spoilsports. The "Marshall Plan" weakened the economies of Western European countries. This plan also failed—especially in France and Italy—to defeat the trade unions or the Communist parties, whose influence is constantly growing.

　　So, it is obvious that the "Marshall Plan" has failed, and there is a need to seek another "savior," so Eisenhower was found. This is another person considered trusted by President Roosevelt. And because he used to be the commander-in-chief of the U.S. and British offensive forces, he has considerable propaganda value in implementing the new stage of American foreign policy—accelerating the war preparations of the United States and Western European countries, which have been completely reduced to economic appendages of the United States in the first stage of the "Marshall Plan."

　　Eisenhower's return to Washington was brought forward due to the imminence of the crisis. The imminence of this crisis caused stock market prices to plummet, causing panic among agricultural operators. Prices fell, unemployment increased sharply, and American workers began to see the shadow of a crisis similar to that of 1929, which once shook the foundations of the capitalist economy.

　　Wall Street, equally driven by the fear of the Great Depression of 1929, believes that the only way to solve the immediate crisis is to increase military spending and strive to promote its plan to dominate the world. So, Eisenhower was summoned to organize all this, using his "prestige" to force Congress to increase military spending and force the "Marshall Plan" countries to subserviently obey Wall Street's schemes, and tie them tightly to the "North Atlantic Treaty." At the same time, American imperialism refuses to guarantee Western European countries that the United States will immediately provide automatic assistance once they are driven into military adventures because of their adherence to Washington's war pact. This reveals its true colors.

　　The "Eisenhower Plan," like its predecessor the "Marshall Plan," has another main purpose: to carry out a campaign against the planned economies of the new democratic countries in Eastern Europe and the Soviet Union. U.S. imperialism and its British accomplices are attempting to incite war panic with their armaments and atomic policies, hoping to force democratic countries to abandon their economic construction plans and join the arms race. But this plan has failed in the past, and there is no doubt that it will fail in the future.

　　As the President's military advisor, Eisenhower will become the practical force behind American foreign policy. As the Paris "Le Monde" (a French semi-official newspaper) said, his return to Washington "is not unrelated to the recent developments in the 'North Atlantic Treaty' negotiations."

　　American rulers expect Eisenhower to "persuade" Western European countries to accept strict obligations to fight for the interests of U.S. imperialism, while the United States itself can be free from corresponding obligations to its European allies. According to Agence France-Presse, Norwegian Foreign Minister Lange was persuaded to accept the American concept of the "North Atlantic Treaty" only after a long talk with Eisenhower.

　　Eisenhower is also relied upon to end the growing opposition of the American people to the American government's war preparation plans. If Senators Connally and Vandenberg recently voiced opposition in the Senate to "including any declaration of moral obligation to declare war" in the "North Atlantic Treaty," it is not because they particularly love peace. The offices of senators and representatives are filled with letters and telegrams protesting against war preparations and high military budgets. It is clear: the national mood is for peace. Therefore, the senators are afraid that if they do not at least pretend to "care for peace," they may suffer the fate of some of their colleagues in the next election of senators and representatives. Now, they are expecting Eisenhower to help them deceive the people.

　　Eisenhower is also expected to use his "prestige" to overcome the consequences of increased armaments inevitably leading to Truman's campaign promises regarding social welfare. Armaments and increased social welfare cannot go hand in hand. All of Truman's promises to voters regarding improving housing conditions, increasing medical facilities, and old-age and sickness insurance will be shattered by heavy armaments. It is known that the military expenditure demanded by Defense Secretary Forrestal is fifty percent more than that stipulated in the actual budget proposal. (Note: The defense expenditure in the budget proposed by Truman on January 10 was 14.3 billion yuan.) This budget leaves no room for improvement in social welfare.

　　The "Eisenhower Plan," like the "Marshall Plan," does not take into account the strength of the peace-loving people led by the Soviet Union, and the strength of the peace sentiment within the United States. This is why Eisenhower cannot do what Marshall has failed to do.

  　评艾森豪威尔上台
    【新华社陕北二十六日电】电通社评论员西蒙二十日评艾森豪威尔上台称：
    在“北大西洋公约”谈判到达高潮时，艾森豪威尔将军之被任命为杜鲁门的军事顾问和联合参谋长（陆、海、空）会议的主席，开始了美国政治的新阶段：“马歇尔计划”公然转变为军事准备的工具了。（按：艾森豪威尔原为美国陆军参谋总长，于去年十月退休，改任哥伦比亚大学校长，今年一月十一日，被杜鲁门任命上述新职。）
    艾森豪威尔就任新职所面临的最主要任务：是迫使国会同意大大地增加军事拨款，作为这一转变计划的一部分。其次，面临着西欧国家之间日益加深的矛盾——这比至今已透露出来的大得多，艾森豪威尔不得不鞭策西欧各国的议会就范。第三，他将平抑美国人民因为美国外交政策日益服从纯军事的考虑而感到的深深恐惧。
    事实上，可以这么说，一个“艾森豪威尔计划”正在代替“马歇尔计划”，而且，后者将不得不面临“援助”经费的巨大削灭，以便充作西欧军事化计划的经费。
    范登堡最近在参院外委员发言时已经说明了这一点。他说：“在参院全体会议对欧洲复兴计划作任何讨论以前，政府必须确定（给予西欧国家的）军事援助计划所需经费的确切数目。”
    美国外交政策由罗斯福的对苏合作的主张，变成了“杜鲁门主义”。但是，杜鲁门以及他的无论哪一个阁员，在美国人民中间都没有足够的威望渡过统治世界的计划的第一阶段。因此，他们产生了这种想法，把外交政策交给马歇尔指导。他的任务就是通过“马歇尔计划”使西欧国家从属于美国，迫使他们向美国的外交政策看齐，并且接受反苏反人民民主国家的军事集团的思想。
    然而，有几样大煞风景的事情。“马歇尔计划”使西欧国家的经济削弱了。这个计划更未能——特别是在法国和意大利——击破工会或共产党，他们的影响正在不断增长着。
    那么，很明显的，“马歇尔计划”已经失败了，于是有寻求另一个“救星”的必要，于是就找到了艾森豪威尔。这是又一个被认为罗斯福总统所信任的人。而且由于他过去担任过美英进攻军队的总司令，因而在实行美国外交政策新的阶段——加速美国和在“马歇尔计划”第一阶段就完全沦为美国经济附庸的西欧各国之战争准备的阶段——的任务上，有颇大的宣传价值。
    艾森豪威尔之返回华府，因危机的迫近而提早。这一危机的迫近，使股票市场价格摇摇欲坠，引起了经营农业者的惊恐。物价下跌，失业大增，美国工人开始看到与一九二九年相似的危机的阴影，那一次危机曾动摇了资本主义经济的基础。
    同样为一九二九年大恐慌的恐惧所驱迫的华尔街，认为解决迫在眼前的危机的唯一办法，是增加军备费用和竭力推进它的统治世界的计划。于是，就召唤艾森豪威尔来组织这一切，以他的“声望”来迫使国会大使增拨军备费用，迫使“马歇尔计划”国家卑躬屈膝地服从华尔街的计策，将它们紧紧地束缚在“北大西洋公约”上。同时，由于美国帝国主义拒绝向西欧国家保证一旦他们因为附和华盛顿的战争公约而被驱入军事冒险时，美国一定随即自动援助。这样就露出了它的狐狸尾巴。
    “艾森豪威尔计划”象它前面的“马歇尔计划”一样，其另一个主要目的是进行反对东欧各新民主国家和苏联的计划经济的运动。美帝国主义及其英国帮凶企图以他们的军备和原子政策，煽起战争恐慌，希望借此迫使民主国家放弃它们的经济建设计划，而参加军备竞赛。但是，这一计划过去已经失败了，而且毫无疑问，将来也要失败。
    作为总统的军事顾问，艾森豪威尔将成为美国外交政策的实际行动。如巴黎“世界”报（按系法国半官方报纸）所说的一样，他返回华盛顿“与‘北大西洋公约’谈判最近的发展不无关系”。
    美国统治者对艾森豪威尔的期望，是他将“劝说”西欧国家接受严格的义务，为美帝国主义利益而战，而美国自己却可以不为其对欧洲盟国相应的义务所束缚。据法新社消息，挪外长兰芸是在与艾森豪威尔举行长谈以后，才被说服接受美国关于“北大西洋公约”的观念的。
    艾森豪威尔也被依恃来终止美国人民对于美国政府准备战争计划的日趋增长的反对。如果说，参议员康纳利和范登堡等最近曾在参院发出反对“北大西洋公约”中“包含任何宣战的道义义务”的任何条款的声音，那也并不是因为他们特别爱好和平。参众两院议员的办公室内，充斥着反对战争准备和高额军事预算的抗议信件和电报。事情很清楚：全国的情绪是要和平。所以，参议员们害怕：假如他们不至少摆个“关怀和平”的样子，在下一届参众议员选举时，他们可能遭到他们某些同事们的命运。现在，他们期望着艾森豪威尔帮助他们骗过人民。
    艾森豪威尔也被期望着以他的“声望”来克服因增加军备而必然会对杜鲁门关于社会福利的竞选诺言所发生的后果。军备与增加社会福利是不能并进的。杜鲁门向选民提出的关于改善居住情况、增加医药设备、老年和疾病保险的全部诺言，将为沉重的军备所粉碎。人们知道国防部长福莱斯特尔要求的军费，较之实际预算案所规定的多百分之五十。（按杜鲁门一月十日所提预算中，国防费用为一四三亿元。）这笔预算使得社会福利就没有什么改善的余地了。
    “艾森豪威尔计划”象“马歇尔计划”一样，没有考虑到以苏联为首的爱好和平的人民的力量，以及美国内部和平情绪的力量。这就是艾森豪威尔不可能做成马歇尔已失败了的事情的原因。
