Comrades! Today's meeting has been very successful. Representatives from various factories have reflected many situations and the opinions of the workers. What's particularly good is that from these opinions, we can see that our workers are not only concerned about wages, benefits, and other living issues, but also more concerned about production and construction. This shows that our working class truly possesses the spirit of being masters of the country. In the puppet Manchurian and Kuomintang eras, you would never have raised these questions, and they would never have allowed you to express these opinions. Only now, under the People's Government, do you enthusiastically express your opinions and care about the major issues of national production and construction. This proves that the Communist Party and the People's Government it leads truly represent everyone, "serve" everyone, and act according to the will of the workers, peasants, and the masses of the people. Workers are not only the masters of the factories, but also the masters of the country. At today's meeting, everyone fully demonstrated this spirit of ownership, showing that the working class has a high level of political awareness, which is particularly gratifying. Please, representatives, go back and tell the workers in your factories: on the one hand, the government will help everyone improve their lives as much as possible, and anything that can be done at present will definitely be done; on the other hand, we must also rely on everyone to take on the responsibility and work together to improve production and defeat the reactionaries as soon as possible. Only in this way will it be possible for all of us to improve our lives.

This meeting is very meaningful. We should hold such meetings regularly so that we can regularly reflect and exchange information about the factories and the opinions of the workers, and improve our work. Comrades, the Communist Party has been leading the revolution for more than twenty years, and now the revolutionary forces are so strong that a nationwide victory is about to come. What magic weapon are we relying on? There is no other magic weapon; it is relying on everyone to come up with ideas. "Three cobblers with their wits combined equal Zhuge Liang." When something happens, we find everyone to hold a meeting and discuss it, and a solution will come out. I propose that in the future, when we hold such meetings, responsible persons from the Railway Bureau, the Ministry of Industry, the Logistics Department, and other relevant departments should participate.

Regarding the problems that everyone has raised today, we must do our best to handle everything that should be done and can be done at present. However, I cannot say that I can answer every question you raise immediately, because without understanding the specific situation of each factory, it is difficult to give specific answers. For example, if someone's salary is assessed unreasonably, this can only be discussed and resolved within the factory. The workers will forgive me for not being able to answer every question today. However, I will definitely be responsible for submitting everyone's opinions to the relevant departments separately and asking them to consider and handle them.

　　At Present, Supporting the Front Line is the Top Priority
　　Living Standards Cannot Be Improved Quickly Yet

The opinions that everyone has raised can be roughly divided into the following categories, which I will now briefly discuss. Regarding the opinions on wages, living conditions, and benefits, some of them can be done at present and should be done. For example, paying monthly wages in two installments and establishing a small library in each factory can be done. Also, if family members are in Shanhaiguan, Tangshan, and other places and now want to be brought back, this can also be done. You can go through the trade union to get a letter of introduction. Those who did not register their household under the Kuomintang rule should, of course, register their household now, which can also be done through the trade union.

There are also some things that should be done, but there are many difficulties at present, and I hope everyone can understand.

The first thing is coal. What is being distributed now is furnace coal, which is difficult to burn, making it difficult to cook early in the morning and delaying work. Why is furnace coal being distributed? I will tell the workers the reason. When Shenyang was liberated, most of what was received was coal from Huazigou, with only more than 20,000 tons of Fushun coal. After the Northeast Army entered the pass, how many trains had to transport supplies and military supplies to them every day, and the locomotives had to burn Fushun coal. Everyone, think about it, is it better to distribute Fushun coal to everyone for cooking, letting the People's Liberation Army who entered the pass go hungry and fail to take down Pingjin? Or is it better for our rear workers and everyone to be inconvenienced and use furnace coal for cooking, and let the Fushun coal be used to transport military supplies for the People's Liberation Army? Of course, everyone has to be inconvenienced. Why can't coal be transported from Fushun, which is so close? Workers! The Fushun Coal Mine was destroyed by the Kuomintang beyond recognition: the open-pit mine only mined coal without removing the soil, and the pits were flooded with water. Now, more than 30,000 workers only produce more than 3,000 tons of coal every day, and the coal mine itself uses more than half of it. It will take a while for the Fushun mine to recover. The pits and wells in the Fuxin Coal Mine are also full of water, and it will take a while to get coal out. There is coal in northern Manchuria, but it cannot be transported in large quantities for the time being, because the trains are not available. In short, is it more important for the People's Liberation Army to fight at the front and liberate the working class and the people of Pingjin? Or is it more important to burn coal in the rear? Of course, fighting is the top priority. If the reactionaries are not completely defeated, the victory of the working class will not be consolidated. For the long-term interests of the entire working class, we can only temporarily endure the difficulty of burning furnace coal. Please, representatives, go back and explain this situation to everyone. The government is not unconcerned about the lives of the workers and is now trying to find ways in all aspects. As long as it can be transported, it will distribute some good coal to everyone.

Another thing that everyone has raised is that there are too few places to distribute grain, and it is too slow to distribute it. Yes, it is indeed not enough to have one or two places to distribute grain to factories with thousands or tens of thousands of people. Compared to an ordinary county town, the number of residents in the city is fifty to sixty thousand. The number of grain, rice, oil, salt, and coal shops for a factory with ten thousand people, plus the workers' families, is almost equivalent to an ordinary county town. Of course, it is not a simple matter to open so many grain, rice, oil, salt, and coal shops. From the overall perspective, this is a very big matter. In December alone, the wages of all state-owned enterprises in Shenyang included a total of 35,000 tons of grain and coal, which required 1,166 train cars to load. It is also a major task to distribute these things to the factories in a few days. It is even more difficult to distribute it from the factory to each person quickly and well. This matter requires the representatives to go back and call on everyone to come up with ideas and discuss a good solution. We need everyone to participate in the work and help, or organize factory consumer cooperatives.

There is one thing that the representatives have not mentioned today, and that is that the grain currently distributed is not very good, and it cannot be fully guaranteed to be good grain in the future. This is also a difficulty. The government's grain is all public grain handed over by the peasants. Most of the emancipated peasants hand over good grain, but there are also a few peasants with poor awareness who hand over grain that is not very good. It is not easy to store too much public grain. In particular, corn is prone to generating heat and mold. If it is not turned over in time, it will mold. Therefore, it is always difficult for the distributed grain to be as good as the grain sold privately in the market. If wages are all paid in money and everyone is allowed to buy it in the market, the banknotes will depreciate, and in the end, everyone will still suffer. Of course, the government always tries its best to distribute better grain to everyone, but sometimes when we encounter bad grain, we ask everyone to understand this difficulty.

Also, the glass windows of the factory were damaged by Kuomintang planes, and it is very cold when working. The factory that manufactures flat glass has not yet resumed work, so we can only temporarily use tin sheets or wooden boards to nail and repair them. Of course, it is still cold and the light is not good, so we ask everyone to be patient for the time being, and it will be easier to handle when the glass factory starts work.

In addition, there are some problems that need to be discussed and decided by everyone. For example, how should light and heavy industries be divided in some departments, and how can wages be assessed more rationally there? All of these need everyone to go back, convene the workers in their factories, and consult with the management of the factory to handle them together.

　　Only by Completely Eliminating the Reactionaries
　　Can We Build a Happy Future

Many representatives said today that the current life is better than it was under the Kuomintang. Yes, it is. But from the perspective of the revolutionary goal of the working class, our current life is still very hard. The purpose of the revolution is to ensure that everyone has food and clothing, and that they eat better and dress better, like the lives of workers in the Soviet Union after three five-year plan constructions. Our current life is still far behind. To reach that level of life, we still need to go a long way. The stumbling block on this road at present is the Kuomintang reactionaries. With them there, our lives cannot reach that stage. The Chinese working class has been oppressed by imperialism and bureaucratic capital for over a hundred years. Now that they are about to collapse in China, Chiang Kai-shek shouted: "Don't fight anymore, I want peace!" He wants the people to let go and let him rest for a while, so that he can make a comeback. Can we let him? (The representatives answered in unison: No!) That's right, never let go, we must resolutely defeat the reactionaries completely. Only by eliminating the reactionaries can we wholeheartedly develop production and build our happy future. After the success of the Soviet revolution, the lives of the people got better day by day after three five-year plans. After we defeat the Kuomintang reactionaries across the country, we will still have to work hard to carry out a major construction. The older workers may be discouraged: "How many years of construction are still needed? I can't wait." If you can't wait, don't you still have your sons and grandsons? Our working class is not only for ourselves, but for the entire people and for the eternal happiness of our descendants. The struggle of the working class for so many years has been to not endure the pain of being oppressed and exploited, and to pursue a better life. Chairman Mao's leadership of the revolution is also for the happiness of the working masses. One hundred and one years ago, Marx wrote the "Communist Manifesto," calling on the working class to rise up in revolution and seek their own liberation. It was not until thirty-one years ago that the Soviet Union emerged, where the working class succeeded in the revolution. The Chinese working class has struggled for two or thirty years, and now it is about to succeed. The working class of Shenyang suffered decades of hardship from the reactionary rule of old China to the oppression of puppet Manchuria and Japan, and then through the Kuomintang's Second Manchuria. Only on November 2nd of last year did the world in Shenyang change. On November 1st, it was still the reactionary rule of the Kuomintang, and on November 2nd, it became the world of the workers and the masses of the people. This is called turning over. It looks like it changed in one day, but this is the result of two or thirty years of struggle. Even after the liberation of the whole country, to achieve good food and clothing, we must rely on our own efforts, and we must calculate that this is not a short road.

The opinions everyone has raised regarding learning show the strong desire of the working class to improve themselves. It is necessary to fully satisfy everyone's requests to enter training classes to learn political knowledge. It is a very good idea to ask to learn technology, translate foreign industrial books, and compile booklets on various industrial knowledge and experiences. These things should be gradually and as much as possible. Some also asked to go to specialized technical schools for further studies, which is also a good idea. Our engineers should not only be able to be graduates from schools, but also select workers with high political awareness, good work, willingness to work hard, and aspiration to go to school to learn, improve their cultural and scientific level, and combine their production experience with scientific principles. In this way, we can definitely train many excellent workers and engineers. This method has been implemented in the Soviet Union for many years, and they have trained many engineers from working-class backgrounds to engage in socialist construction. However, we cannot set up such specialized schools here immediately. We can first set up some training classes, tutoring classes, and evening tutoring schools.

　　Staff and Cadres Should Unite as One
　　Take on Responsibilities and Improve Production

Some representatives have raised some opinions from workers about individual staff members in the factory. Our view should be this: workers are the direct laborers in the factory, the most numerous, and the most important. Many staff members used to have a shortcoming, that is, they looked down on laborers and despised workers. They felt that wearing a long robe and holding a pen was being "superior." Some of them have done things that they were sorry for workers about. However, we must recognize that staff members are also indispensable in production. Without staff members drawing diagrams, writing accounts, and calculating with abacuses, it would not work. Without engineers and management personnel, it would be even more impossible. Moreover, in the future, many workers will also become staff members, technicians, and management personnel.

At present, if there are "opinions" between any part of the workers and any staff member in any factory, that should be resolved. The way to resolve it should be based on the source of this "opinion," and the North Manchurian experience written in the "Decision on Staff Issues in Public Enterprises" of the Northeast Bureau of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China on August 1, 1948, should be used as a reference to stipulate appropriate methods. The purpose is to achieve unity among the employees of the factory, except for individual staff members who have done a lot of evil and must be expelled from the factory, and to improve production. If a worker has been angered by a staff member, and if the anger is not great, and if the staff member has self-criticized and apologized, then the worker's anger should be resolved. Our working class must be resolute and thorough in defeating the reactionaries, and we should regard small "anger" among employees who should cooperate as a small matter. The working class is a class that does great things. We want to liberate the 470 million people of China and the 1.2 billion people of the world, and we want to overthrow the unreasonable social system that has existed for thousands of years and establish a new and reasonable social system. Our cause is incomparable to any emperor or president in ancient and modern times, both in China and abroad. Chiang Kai-shek has been reactionary for twenty years and is about to end. Japanese fascism ruled Manchuria for only fourteen years. No matter how powerful they are, they can only rule one country or run rampant for a few decades at most. And our cause, our world, is a country for thousands of generations, and the happiness of all the people in the world for millions of years. The working class, which does such great things, should distinguish between big and small things and devote all its efforts to doing big things. As long as the "anger" between employees has been properly resolved, they should unite as one, work hard in production, support the front line, and defeat the reactionaries, so as to create a free world for the working class and the masses of the people.

In terms of production, the opinions put forward today are all very good. In this regard, the workers must at least estimate two difficulties. The first is that our old cadres are not yet proficient in production management, and we still lack experience. The second difficulty is that there is a shortage of raw materials and equipment, and it is also difficult to replenish them because we are currently in a war environment. Therefore, workers need to think of ways and need workers to give play to the working class's spirit of overcoming difficulties. Think of ways to save raw materials, use all available equipment and even things that have been treated as waste, and further try to create substitutes. After the representatives return, they should discuss with their factory directors and managers, and then gather the opinions of all the workers to formulate a three-month production plan or a one-year plan. Everyone should go back and tell all the workers that they should take on the responsibility, not only work actively, but also truly fulfill the responsibility of being the masters, manage the work under the leadership of the factory director, and unite with the staff to work together. In addition, we must especially tell all the workers to boldly put forward opinions. All opinions that are beneficial to production, whether about workers' lives or production, can be put forward. If the opinions are feasible, they can be jointly implemented after being agreed upon by the management and the workers. Now the management will not be unwilling for the workers to put forward opinions, so the workers should be responsible for the production and work in the factory and put forward opinions and discuss methods to make production better.

### 陈云同志在沈阳工人代表大会上的讲话

　　陈云同志在沈阳工人代表大会上的讲话
    同志们！今天的会开得很好，各厂的代表都反映了许多情况和工友们的意见；特别好的是从这些意见中看到，我们工人不仅是关心工资、福利和其他生活上的问题，而且更关心生产建设的问题。这表示我们工人阶级确实具有国家主人翁的气派。在伪满与国民党时代，你们决不会提出这些问题，他们也决不让你们提出这些意见；只有现在，在人民政府之下，你们才热烈地发表意见，关心国家生产建设的大事。这证明共产党及其领导的人民政府，是真正代表大家、为大家“当差”的，是遵循工人、农民、人民大众的意思办事的。工人不仅是工厂的主人，又是国家的主人。今天这个会上，大家都充分表现了这种主人翁的精神，表现出工人阶级的政治觉悟很高，这是特别值得高兴的事。请代表们回去告诉你们厂里的工友们：政府一方面要帮助大家尽可能把生活改善，凡是目前办得到的事，一定办；另一方面也要靠大家挑起担子，共同把生产搞好，早日打倒反动派，只有这样，我们大家的生活改善才有可能。
    这个会开的很有意义，以后还要经常开这样的会，以便能经常把工厂的情况和工人的意见反映交换，改善我们的工作。同志们，共产党领导革命二十几年了，现在革命力量这样强大，全国胜利就要到来，是依靠什么法宝呢？没有别的，就是依靠大家出主意。“三个臭皮匠，凑个诸葛亮”，有事找大家开会商量，办法就出来了。我提议：以后开这样的会，铁路局、工业部、后勤部等，各个有关部门的负责人员都要来参加。
    大家今天提出的问题，凡是当前应该办、可以办得到的事，一定尽力办去。但是我不能说你们提出的每个问题我都能马上回答，因为对于各个工厂的具体情况不了解，就难以作具体的答复。比如某某人的工资评得不合理，这只有工厂内都才能讨论解决。工友们将原谅我今天不能对你们的每个问题都作答复。但是，我一定负责把大家的意见分别交给各个有关的部门，请他们斟酌办理。
  　目前支援前线是第一
  　生活还不能很快提高
    大家所提的意见，大约可分这样几类，现在我扼要来谈谈。大家提的关于工资、生活和福利方面的意见，这当中有些是目前可以办得到的，就应当办起来。比如每月工资分两次发，每个工厂设立一小图书馆，这都是可以办的。又如家属在山海关、唐山等地，现在要接回来，这也是能办到的，你们可以经过职工会去领路条，过去国民党统治时没有报上户口的，现在当然应报上户口，这也可经过职工会来办。
    还有些事情也是应该办的，但在目前却有很多困难，希望大家能体谅。
    第一件是煤炭。现在发的是炉煤，不好烧，早起做饭困难，还耽误上班。为什么发炉煤呢？我把缘由告诉工友们。沈阳解放时接收的大部分都是桦子沟的煤，只有两万多吨抚顺煤。东北大军进了关，每天得多少列车给他们运给养军需，火车头又非烧抚顺煤不可。大家想想，是把抚顺煤发给大家做饭，让进关的人民解放军饿肚子打不下平津好呢？还是只好让我们后方工友们和大家委屈点，用炉煤做饭，把抚顺煤给人民解放军运军需用好呢？当然只好大家委屈点。为什么抚顺这样近运不来煤？工友们！抚顺煤矿叫国民党破坏得不成样子：露天矿光挖煤不剥土，坑洞给水淹满，现在三万多工人每天才出三千来吨煤，煤矿本身就用掉一半多。抚顺矿要经过一个时间才恢复得过来。阜新煤矿坑井也尽是水，出煤还得一个时候。北满倒是有煤，但是一时不能大量运过来，这是火车不得空的原故。总之，人民解放军到前方打仗，解放平津的工人阶级和那里的人民要紧呢？还是后方烧煤要紧呢？当然是打仗第一，不彻底打倒反动派，工人阶级的胜利就不巩固。为了全体工人阶级的长远利益，只有暂时忍受一下烧炉煤的困难，这种情形要请代表们回去给大伙说清楚。政府不是不关心工人生活，现在正在从各方面想办法，只要能运到，就给大家发些好煤。
    再一件大家提出的，发粮食的地方太少了，发起来太慢。是的，几千人到万把人的工厂，一两个地方发粮，的确不够。拿普通一个县城打比，城里居民五六万人，有多少粮米油盐煤炭铺一万人的工厂加上工人家属，差不多抵一个普通县城，要开那样多的粮米油盐煤炭铺当然不是件简单事。从全体来看，这是一件很大的事。光十二月份沈阳所有公营企业的工资中，仅粮煤二项共三万五千吨，得一千一百六十六个车皮装；把这些东西在几天之内再分发到各厂去，这又是一件大事；再要从工厂发到每个人手中，还要发得快，发得好。更不是容易办的事。这件事需要代表们回去号召大家出主意，商量个好办法出来。要大家来参加工作，帮忙，或者组织工厂消费合作社。
    有一件事代表们今天还没有提出来，这就是现在发的粮食还不算好，以后还不能完全保证都发好粮。这件事也是个困难。政府的粮食都是农民交的公粮，翻身的农民大多数都是交好粮食，但也有少数觉悟较差的农民，交的粮不大好。公粮太多不易保管。特别苞米容易生热发霉，一时翻腾不到就霉了。所以发的粮食总难象市场上私人卖的那样好。如果工资都发钱让大家到市上去买，票子就要毛了，结果还是大家吃亏。政府当然总是想尽一切办法给大家发好点的粮食，但有时遇到不好的，就要请大家体谅这个困难。
    还有，工厂的玻璃窗叫国民党飞机震坏了，做工的时候很冷。现在造平板玻璃的工厂还没有复工，只好暂用洋铁片或木板钉补一下。当然还是冷，而且光线不好，这也要请大家暂时忍耐，等玻璃厂开工就好办了。
    另外有些问题，也是要靠大家商量决定的。如有些部门轻重工业怎样分法，在那里的工资怎样评定才更合理等等，都是要靠大家回去，召集本厂工友，会同厂里的管理方面，大家商量着办。
  　只有彻底消灭反动派
  　才能建设幸福的将来
    今天也有许多代表说，现有的生活，比国民党在时好了。是的。但是从工人阶级革命的目的来看，我们现在的生活还是很苦。革命的目的是为了劳动者人人有吃有穿，而且要吃得较好，穿得较好，象经过了三个五年计划建设的苏联的工人生活那样。我们现在的生活还差得很远，要达到那样的生活水平，还需要走一段很长的路。目前在这段路上的绊脚石就是国民党反动派，有它在，我们的生活休想到那步田地。中国工人阶级受帝国主义和官僚资本压迫上百年了，现在眼看它们在中国就要垮台，蒋介石却叫喊起来：“不打了，我要和平！”他想叫人民松手，让他休息一会，以便卷土重来。我们能让吗？（代表齐声回答：不让！）对，决不松手，要坚决把反动派彻底打倒。消灭了反动派，我们才能全心全力来发展生产，建设我们幸福的将来。苏联革命成功以后，经过三个五年计划，人民生活才一天天好起来。我们在全国打垮国民党反动派以后，也还要艰苦奋斗来一次大建设。上了岁数的工友也许灰心：“还要多少年建设，我等不上了。”你等不上，不是还有你的儿子孙子？我们工人阶级不是光为自己，是为整个人民大众，为我们的后代子子孙孙永远的幸福。工人阶级这多年来的奋斗，就是为了不能忍受被压迫被剥削的痛苦，为了追求美好的生活。毛主席领导革命也就是为劳动大众的幸福。一百零一年前，马克思就写了“共产党宣言”，号召工人阶级起来革命，自求解放。直到三十一年前才出了个苏联，那里的工人阶级革命成功了。中国工人阶级奋斗了二三十年，现在就要成功了。沈阳的工人阶级从旧中国反动统治，到伪满日本压迫，又经过国民党的二满洲，受了几十年苦，到去年十一月二日，沈阳的天下才变了。十一月一号，还是国民党的反动统治，十一月二号就变成工人和人民大众的天下了。这叫做翻身，看起来就是一天变过来，但这是奋斗了二三十年的结果。就是全国解放之后，要达到吃好穿好，也要靠我们大伙自己努力，而且要计算到这是一段不短的路程。
    大家提出的关于学习方面的意见，表现出工人阶级强烈的上进心，入训练班学习政治知识，这是应该充分满足大家要求的。要求学技术，翻译外国文的工业书籍，编写各种工业知识与经验的小册子，这是很好的意见，这些事都应该逐步地尽量办起来。有的还要求入专门技术学校深造，这个意见也是好的。我们的工程师不光是学校毕业的学生能当，还要挑选政治觉悟高、工作好、肯用功、有上进心的工人，到学校去学习，提高他们的文化科学水平，把他们的生产经验与科学原理结合起来，这样就一定可以培养出许多优秀的工人，工程师，这个办法苏联已经实行多年了，他们培养了很多工人出身的工程师，从事社会主义建设。但是，这种专门学校我们这里马上还办不起来，现在可以先办一些训练班、补习班、补习夜校。
  　职工干部要团结一致
    挑起担子把生产搞好
    有代表提出了工友们对于工厂个别职员有些意见。我们的看法应该如此：工人是工厂里直接劳动的，人数最多，是最重要的。许多职员过去有一种缺点，就是轻视劳动者，瞧不起工人。觉得自己穿长袍握笔杆，就是“上等人”。其中有的人有过对不起工人的地方。但是，要认识职员也是生产中不可缺少的，没有职员画图、写帐、打算盘也不行，没有工程师和管理人员更不行。而且将来有许多工人还要当职员，技师和管理人员。
    目前，哪个工厂的哪部分工人对哪个职员之间有“意见”的话，那是应该加以解决的。解决的办法应该根据这种“意见”的来源，再把中共中央东北局一九四八年八月一日“关于公营企业中职员问题的决定”中所写的北满经验作为参考，规定适当办法。其目的是达到除了个别作恶甚多的职员，必须开除出厂以外，各厂员工之间，团结一致，提高生产。工友之中如果受过哪个职员的气，如果所受的气不大，又如果这个职员自我批评了而且道了歉，那么工友的气就应该了结。我们工人阶级对于打倒反动派必须坚决彻底，对于应该合作的员工之间的小“气”应该看成是小事。工人阶级是一个干大事的阶级，我们要解放全中国四万万七千万人与全世界一二十万万人，要把人类数千年来不合理的社会制度推翻，建立新的合理的社会制度。我们的事业是古今中外任何一个皇帝、总统也比不上的，蒋介石反动了二十来年就要完了，日本法西斯统治满洲也不过十四年，他们不论怎样威风，顶多只能统治一国、横行几十年。而我们的事业我们的天下却是千秋万代的江山，全世界人民万万年的幸福。办这样大事的工人阶级，应该把大事小事分别开来，全力干大事。只要员工之间的“气”已经适当解决了，就应该团结一致，努力生产，支援前线，把反动派打倒，以便创造工人阶级和人民大众的自由天地。
    在生产方面，今天提的意见都是很好的。这方面工友们至少要估计到两个困难。第一个是我们的老干部对管理生产还不内行，我们还缺乏经验。第二个困难是原料器材不足，目前又处在战争环境中，补充也很困难。因此，就需要工友们大家想办法，需要工友们发挥工人阶级克服困难的精神。想办法节省原料，利用一切能找到的器材乃至已被当作废物的东西，进一步能设法创造代用品。代表们回去后，就与自己的厂长经理商量，再集合全体工友的意见，订出三个月的生产计划，或者一年的计划。大家回去要告诉全体工友，要大家挑起担子，不光是积极做工，还要真正尽主人翁的责任，在厂长领导之下管理工作，团结职员一起干。此外，还要特别告诉全体工友们，要大胆提意见。凡属对生产有好处的意见，关于工人生活也好，生产也好，都可以提，做得通的意见，经过管理方面和工友方面商定之后，就可以合力办。现在管理方面不会不愿意工人提意见，所以，工友们就应该对于厂里的生产和工作大家负责提意见，商量办法，把生产搞得更好。
