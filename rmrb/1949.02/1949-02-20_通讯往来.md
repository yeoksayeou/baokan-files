　　To all branch offices, all offices, and all correspondents:

　　The Beginning of Spring has passed, and spring plowing will soon begin in various places. Please promptly seize the season to report on agricultural production plans for this year and the spring plowing period in various places, as well as the spring production activities of farmers. Such as spring plowing work: repairing land, purchasing livestock and farm tools, allocating seeds, increasing fertilizer accumulation, and organizing labor and livestock power for spring plowing; flood prevention work: repairing rivers and restoring dikes, planting trees and afforestation; new areas and areas with spring famine: mass production for self-salvation, leadership in overcoming famine. Especially in areas where land reform and democratic party rectification have ended, pay attention to reflecting the problems existing in farmers' production, the unity of all classes in production, organizing to get rich (cooperation, mutual assistance), and the situation of rural branches and village cadres leading mass production. In particular, land reform has ended in the old areas, and large-scale production movements will be launched this year. In addition to reporting on the general situation, various places are expected to offer new content and new characteristics, and conduct continuous reports based on the season.
