　　Xinhua News Agency, Jinan, 30th. Workers of the Fourth Factory of a certain factory under the Jinan Industrial Bureau have gradually established a new labor attitude over the past three months, strengthening the unity between workers and between masters and apprentices, greatly increasing production. Since the factory rewarded workers who contributed to protecting the factory during the war and those who contributed to the resumption of work, and carried out political study, the workers have felt that labor under the leadership of the Communist Party is the glorious task of the workers and is also for the benefit of the workers themselves. If today we treat our own people's factories with the same "go slow" attitude we adopted towards bureaucratic capitalists, it would be a disgrace. Many workers in the factory who used to "go slow" have now become production activists. In October (when Jinan was first liberated), "go slow" workers accounted for 50% of the total number of workers, in November it decreased to 10%, and in December it further decreased to 3%. In terms of master-apprentice relationships, in the past, masters always "conserved experience and blocked technology," always dismissing apprentices' questions, so that apprentices did not understand even the most basic techniques after several years. For example, Liu Kejun, who had been an apprentice for two years, did not even know how to use scales and drill bits; Shi Wanfu, who had been an apprentice for three years, could not even find the problems with his own tools when they broke every day. Now, the apprentices in the machine shop have formed four groups and hold meetings regularly to study. In addition to respecting technicians, they also wipe the machines clean and find tools quickly, making it easier for technicians to work without delaying production. Technical workers have also spontaneously formed seven groups, in addition to researching technology and exchanging experiences, they also teach apprentices. For example, Huang Renshuo and Li Baoxiang gave group lessons to apprentices who did not know how to use scales and drill bits, helping them experiment. Li Baoxiang also patiently taught his skills, bit by bit, to apprentice Bu Fanshui, who is now able to do ordinary work. Staff members have also initially changed some of the bad habits they picked up in the old society and have begun to consciously work hard. For example, Wang Yizhi, the deputy director of the General Affairs Office, voluntarily also does clerical work. Various units have also streamlined their operations, transferring most of the original service personnel to the production department to become apprentices. This not only improved work efficiency, but also cultivated the labor concept of staff members. At the same time, it also brought the relationship between workers and staff closer. Based on this new labor attitude and unity, the factory's production has greatly increased. They often complete large-scale tasks supporting the front ahead of schedule, and have repaired all of the fifty or sixty machines and tools that had been damaged under the Kuomintang rule.

### 济市工业局某厂职工　确立新劳动态度　生产量大大提高

　　济市工业局某厂职工
  　确立新劳动态度
  　生产量大大提高
    【新华社济南卅日电】济南市工业局某厂第四厂的职工，三个月来逐渐确立了新的劳动态度，加强了职工间和师徒间的团结，使生产量大大提高了一步。该厂自从奖励了在战争中保护工厂有功的与复工有功的职工并进行政治学习以来，职工们都感到：在共产党领导下劳动是工人的光荣的任务，也是为着工人自己的利益。如果今天以对待官僚资本家所采取的“磨洋工”来对待人民自己的工厂，那就是耻辱。该厂许多过去是“磨洋工”的工人，现在都成了生产积极分子。十月份（济市初解放时）“磨洋工”的占工人总数的百分之五十，十一月份减到百分之十；十二月份更减到百分之三。在师徒关系上，过去当老师的一向是“保守经验，封锁技术”，对学徒的问难总是推开了事，以致学徒当了几年连起码的技术也不懂。如当了两年学徒的刘克俊，连尺码和钻头码都不会用；当三年学徒的时万富，连每天自己用的工具坏了都找不出毛病来。现在机工部的学徒成立了四个小组，按时开会学习。他们除尊重技工外，并把机器擦的干干净净，找工具也找得快，使技工得心应手，不耽误做活。技术工人也自动地成立了七个小组，除研究技术交流经验外，并为学徒们上课。如黄仁朔、李宝祥等替不会使尺码、钻头码的学徒分组上课，帮助他们实验。李宝祥并把自己的技术，一点一滴地耐心教给学徒卜范水，现卜范水已能干一般的普通活了。职员方面也初步改变了在旧社会中感染的一些坏作风，开始自觉地努力工作，如总务室副主任王一之即自动兼做文书工作。各单位也大行精简，将原有的勤务员大部调到生产部门中去当学徒。这样，不但提高了工作效率，而且也锻炼了职员们的劳动观念。同时，更使职工关系密切起来。该厂职工们在这种新的劳动态度和团结的基础上，生产量大大提高了，他们经常提前完成大批的支前任务，并把在国民党统治下已用坏的五、六十盘机器和工具全部修复了。
