　　Jin Sui Administrative Office Issues Mobilization Order
　　Intensify Spring Ploughing Preparations

　　【Xinhua News Agency, Jin Sui, 5th】The Jin Sui Liberated Area Administrative Office issued a spring ploughing preparation mobilization order on January 26th, calling on all levels of government agencies and the people of the entire region to intensify spring ploughing preparations. The aim is to complete the task of increasing the yield of coarse grains by two "da sheng" (each "sheng" is three "jin") per mu this year, in order to gradually restore and exceed the pre-War of Resistance Against Japan agricultural production level within two to three years. The mobilization order pointed out that the spring ploughing preparation work that governments at all levels should immediately carry out is as follows: (1) Organize the masses to voluntarily form "peng niu" (i.e., two or more people jointly purchase cattle), "da niu" (because one cattle cannot plough the land, two people and two cattle must cooperate), "tie niu" (i.e., using other people's cattle and providing fodder), and hire cattle as early as possible; increase cattle feed early; in areas lacking cattle, organize the masses to purchase from outside, and plan to use local "old associations" to organize mule and horse associations to regulate draught animals; ensure ploughing before sowing. (2) Prepare and regulate seeds as early as possible, mainly naked oats, peas, cotton seeds, etc. (3) Prepare and repair farm implements as early as possible. (4) Make plans for restoring and constructing water conservancy projects as early as possible, and prepare water conservancy project materials. (5) In areas where millet is grown more, mobilize the masses to prepare for digging millet stubble as early as possible to prevent insect pests. (6) Transport public grain and various materials in a planned manner as early as possible. (7) Call on and organize the masses to change work teams and deliver manure early, striving to deliver it to the fields before the Spring Equinox. (8) Pay attention to the spring ploughing preparation work of the families of revolutionary soldiers, the families of revolutionary workers, and the families of martyrs as early as possible, and help them solve their spring ploughing difficulties in a timely manner.
