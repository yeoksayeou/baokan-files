　　Renjiakeng Village Has a Foundation in Iron Industry; Needs Supply and Marketing Cooperative to Help Develop
　　[This Newspaper reports] Renjiakeng Village, in the Fifth District of Hengshui, Jinnan, has a good foundation in the iron industry, but it still needs to strengthen organizational leadership to help its development. Currently, the entire village has sixteen iron furnaces, each with three to four people, totaling sixty-four workers, specializing in making agricultural tools such as cannons, knives, axes, saws, sickles, hoes, shovels, and picks. The furnaces are fired up during the agricultural slack seasons of spring, summer, and winter each year. Although the iron furnaces in this village are a sideline production, they are the main source of income for some villagers. For example, last summer, forging sickles for two months earned each person about 1,000 catties of millet. If the market price is stable, each person can earn about one dou of millet per day on average. In addition to customers coming directly to the village to buy the finished products, most of them are picked up by nearby merchants and peddlers, or transported by wheelbarrow, and sold to Anguo, Xingtai, Linqing, and other places hundreds of miles around. The raw materials for ironware, various kinds of scrap iron, are collected by peddlers from various places or purchased from the village. A quarter of the village's population relies on selling ironware or scrap iron for livelihood subsidies. As many as eleven households rely solely on selling ironware for a living.

　　The iron furnaces in the village all operate in a cooperative manner, mainly relying on mutual agreement. For example, Ren Xuerong, the owner of one furnace, works with three others: his two brothers plus Ren Fenghui and Ding Wenxing. They rotate every nine days, giving each person two days of work, and since the furnace owner provides the tools, he gets an extra day. The order of work starts with the furnace owner, then the bellows operator, the large hammerer, and the second hammerer, rotating in that order. If there is a distinction between old and new workers among the partners, the old worker has priority; if there is a significant difference in skills, the number of days rotated by the less skilled worker is reduced. For example, the furnace owner Ding Shunzi cooperates with Ding Qinbo and Ding Qinguang. They rotate every five days because the latter two are beginners; Ding Shunzi takes three days, and the other two each take one day. There is a fixed quantity of products each day. For example, if fourteen axes are made each day, then anyone in the furnace who is making axes must make fourteen axes to count as a day. There is no limit to the number of types of ironware made each day. There is a certain conversion standard between various goods, such as making fourteen axes is equivalent to fifty sickles. This kind of cooperative and mutual aid form is completely built on a voluntary and equal basis, so it has always been very solid. However, this kind of cooperation is limited to labor mutual aid. Buying raw materials and selling finished products are all managed by each individual. Sometimes, when one person in the furnace goes out to buy raw materials, the others have to stop working and wait because they are short of one person. Those who lack labor feel even more difficult, such as the single old man Li Mingyuan. He has to go to the market to buy scrap iron, go to the city to haul charcoal, and after making the finished products, he has to worry about selling them, wasting a lot of production time. The entire production process is carried out blindly and without planning. For example, when buying raw materials, they buy as much scrap iron as they can, buying more when it's cheap, and competing with each other when it's scarce, and they can't buy it even at a high price; when making goods, they make whatever sells well. For example, some time ago, planes were selling well, and Li Wenkui's furnace made more than one hundred in nine days. As a result, there were too many planes, and they couldn't sell them even for 360 yuan per hundred, when they used to be 450 yuan per hundred in new currency. And customers can't buy other goods they need. Blind production affects sales. Therefore, the iron furnace industry in Renjiakeng Village urgently needs to be organized and led so that the entire production process can be carried out in a planned manner. First of all, a cooperative mainly engaged in supply and sales should be organized to supply raw materials to the iron furnaces and sell finished products on their behalf, so that the masses can concentrate on making goods and increase production. Hengshui County should actively provide assistance with production leadership organizations.

　　任家坑村铁业有基础
  　需设供销社帮助发展
    【本报讯】冀南衡水五区任家坑村铁业有良好基础，但尚须加强组织领导帮助其发展。现全村铁炉十六座，每炉三、四人不等，共六十四人工作，专制炮、刀、斧、锯、镰、锄、锹、镐等农具。每年春、夏、冬三季农闲时开炉。该村铁炉虽属副业生产，却为部分村民主要收入。如去夏打镰两月，每人即赚小米千斤左右。如市价平稳，平均每人每天约可收入一斗小米。产出成品除顾主直接来村购买外，大部为附近商人、小贩抢挑、推车行销周围数百里的安国、邢台、临清等地。铁货原料的各种烂铁，由小贩到各处搜集或向本村购买。全村人口四分之一靠贩卖铁货或烂铁为生活补助。专靠贩卖铁货为生者即十一户之多。
    该村铁炉经营均采取合作方式，主要靠彼此心投意合，如炉主任学荣的铁炉四个人，他兄弟俩加上任凤辉、丁文兴两人，做工九天轮流一遍，给每人各做两天，因炉主出工具，给他多做一天。干活次序从炉主开始，然后拉风箱的、拿大锤、二锤的依次互做。伙计中如有新旧之分，则旧伙计有优先权；如技术优劣悬殊，技术差者轮流天数减少。如炉主丁顺子和丁沁波、丁沁光二人合作，他们是五天轮流一次，因后两人是初学，丁顺子占三天，他两人各占一天。每天产品均有一定数量，如每日打斧十四把，则给同炉任何人打斧时均须满十四把才能算一天。各天打铁货种数无限制。各货之间有一定折算标准，如打十四把斧即可顶五五十把镰。此种合作互助形式，完全建筑在自愿、等价基础上，所以历来都很巩固。但此种合作仅限于劳动互助。购买原料、推销成品都是各人管各人。有时炉上一人外出购原料，其他人因缺了一人不能工作，只好停工等着。缺乏劳力的更感困难，如单身汉李明远老汉，他要赶集买烂铁、又要上城拉炭，打出成品还得操心推销，浪费生产时间不少。整个生产过程则是盲目无计划地进行，如买原料时，烂铁有多少买多少，多时便宜，少时互相争购，高价也买不到；制货时那种货好卖都打制那一种，如前些时候刨子好卖，李文奎炉上九天打了一百多张，结果刨子多了，过去新币四百五十元一百张，现在三百六十元也买不掉。而顾客需要别的货又买不到。盲目生产影响推销。因此，任家坑村的铁炉业，亟须加以组织领导，使生产的整个过程能有计划进行。首先应组织起一个以供销为主的合作社，供给铁炉原料与代销成品，使群众能专心制货，增加生产。衡水县应以生产领导组织积极予以扶助。
