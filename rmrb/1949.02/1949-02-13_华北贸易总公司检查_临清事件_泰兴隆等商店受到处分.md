　　North China Trade Corporation Investigates "Linqing Incident"; Taixinglong and Other Stores Punished

　　[This newspaper's report] On December 8th of last year, this newspaper published news about certain state-owned stores in Linqing City violating policies, colluding with private merchants, and disrupting the market. After this news was published, the North China Trade Corporation immediately dispatched Comrade Guo Zhendong, Deputy Director of the Materials Adjustment Department, on the 13th to investigate the relevant companies and stores in Jinnan and Jilu豫 (Ji-Lu-Yu) to determine responsibility. Now, based on the results of the investigation and Article 1 of Section 2 of the Draft Economic Discipline for State-Owned Trade Departments, an application has been submitted to the Ministry of Industry and Commerce and the Finance and Economics Committee to impose penalties on the relevant companies and stores. This penalty has been approved, and the details are as follows:

　　(1) Jilu豫 (Ji-Lu-Yu) District Company: In the business plan decided at the September meeting last year, the Jilu豫 (Ji-Lu-Yu) District Company focused on grain management and had no cotton purchase task. In order to support the region's textile industry, the General Company allocated one million jin of cotton to the company, and the original Jin-Ji-Lu-Yu General Company also allocated two million jin in the spring of 1948. The company knew that Taixinglong store was purchasing cotton in Linqing but did not stop it. At the same time, it did not implement the decision that the two districts would not set up stalls or be allowed to directly purchase materials in neighboring markets. As early as when it was the Jin-Ji-Lu-Yu General Company, it was decided to abolish the Defengyu store in Linqing, but although it was later changed to a warehouse and decided not to engage in business, in this incident, the warehouse initially requested to purchase cotton, which the district company correctly did not allow. However, when the second request was made, it replied that "purchases can be made without affecting the cotton price." At the same time, when the cotton price had already fluctuated greatly, the district company did not promptly check and stop it. Based on the above, the company's manager, Fan Yangmin, and deputy manager, Fan Yunzhong, should be given a demerit.

　　(2) Taixinglong Store of Jilu豫 (Ji-Lu-Yu) District Company: Without first requesting instructions from the district company and not implementing the General Company's decision not to purchase materials in neighboring districts, it proceeded solely from a profit-seeking perspective and directly rushed to purchase 180,000 jin of cotton in Linqing City and transport it to Jinan for sale. In the rush to purchase, it disregarded quality and price, and entrusted private merchants to recklessly purchase in the market, causing large fluctuations in cotton prices, encouraging speculative merchants to adulterate the cotton with water, and purchasing a lot of damp cotton, causing great losses to the national treasury. Based on the above errors, the store's manager, Liang Jianzhai, should be given a demerit.

　　(3) Defengyu Store (i.e., Linqing Warehouse): Also proceeding from a purely profit-seeking perspective, it did not seriously implement the district company's instruction that "purchases can be made without affecting the cotton price." It continued to purchase even when cotton prices were fluctuating greatly, which stimulated cotton prices and resulted in the purchase of some damp cotton. The store's manager, Yu Shengtao, should be given a warning.

　　(4) Jinnan District Company: It did not seriously study and implement the provisions of the General Company's September meeting on business planning, specifically Section E of "Several Issues to Pay Attention to in Implementing the Business Plan": "Our business plan is full of the spirit of stabilizing prices and supporting production, and it must be implemented in every business," and Section F: "The purchase of cloth and cotton must implement the spirit of supporting production and stabilizing prices, resolutely oppose task rushes that disregard price fluctuations, and also oppose the skimming policy of deliberately suppressing prices." As a result, it adopted a rush approach to deployment, affecting price fluctuations. The district company has already been criticized in the sixth issue of the Trade Monthly and has been ordered to make a written self-criticism.

　　华北贸易总公司检查“临清事件”
  　泰兴隆等商店受到处分
    【本报讯】去年十二月八日，本报曾发表临清市某些公营商店，违反政策，串通私商，捣乱市场的新闻。此消息公布后，华北贸易总公司当即于十三日派物资调剂处副处长郭震东同志前往冀南、冀鲁豫各有关公司、商店进行检查，追究责任，现根据检查结果和国营贸易部门经济纪律草案第二项第一条规定，申请工商部及财委会，对各有关公司、商店分别给予处分。此项处分，业经批准、详情如下：
    （一）冀鲁豫区公司：在去年九月会议决定的业务计划中，冀鲁豫区公司是以粮食经营为重点，没有购棉任务，并为了支持该区纺织，曾由总公司拨给该公司棉花一百万斤，原冀鲁豫总公司也曾于四八年春拨过二百万斤。此次泰兴隆商店在临清购棉，该公司知道也未加制止。同时又不执行两区互不设摊，不准到邻区市场上直接采购物资的决定。早在晋冀鲁豫总公司时，即决定撤消该区在临清的德丰裕商店，后虽改设仓库，决定不经营业务，但在这次事件中，该仓库第一次请示购棉，区公司没有允许是正确的，第二次请示时，却复以“在不影响棉价下可以购买”，同时在棉价已经大波动，区公司没有及时检查制止。根据以上几项，该公司经理范仰民，副经理范允中应给予记过处分。
    （二）冀鲁豫区公司泰兴隆商店：事前不请示区公司与不执行总公司不准在邻区收购物资的决定，单纯从营利观点出发，到临清市直接抢购棉花十八万斤运往济南出售。在抢购时不顾质量，不问价钱，并委托私商在市上乱肆抢购，造成棉价大波动，助长投机商人从中掺水使潮，买了许多潮花，使国库受到极大损失。根据以上错误，该商店经理梁坚斋应予以记过处分。
    （三）德丰裕商店（即临清仓库）：也从单纯营利观点出发，不认真执行区公司“在不影响棉价情况下，可以购买”的指示。而在棉价大波动中仍继续收购，既刺激了棉价，又买进了一部潮花。该商店经理俞圣陶，应予警告处分。
    （四）冀南区公司：对总公司九月会议业务计划中提出的：执行业务计划应注意的几个问题的戊项：“我们的业务计划充满着平稳物价扶助生产的精神，必须把它贯彻到每一个业务中去”，和己项：代购布棉必须贯彻扶植生产、平稳物价的精神，坚决反对当任务突击不顾物价波动，同时也反对故意压价的撇油政策，均没有认真研究执行，结果采取突击方式布置，影响物价波动。对该区公司已在贸易月刊第六期上提出批评，并责成他们作出书面检讨。
