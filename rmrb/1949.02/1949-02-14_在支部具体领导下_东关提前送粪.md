Under the Specific Leadership of the Branch
　　Dongguan Delivers Manure Ahead of Time
　　[Another Dispatch] Since the rectification campaign in Dongguan Village, the Third District of Qinghe, the relationship between the Party and the masses has become even closer. Party members and cadres have greatly improved politically and are actively leading the masses in accumulating fertilizer and increasing production. On the 5th of this month, the village branch proposed that the old house soil currently being discarded is a good fertilizer. While the ground is frozen and the livestock are idle, the masses should be mobilized to distribute it to the fields. According to statistics, there are more than 1,200 large carts of broken house soil and broken wall soil, enough to cover one or two *qing* of land. Applying it to the fields can increase grain yields significantly. A mass meeting was immediately convened, and the chairman of the farmers' association presented the above opinions to everyone. The masses were very happy and said in unison, "Good! Good! Just this old house soil can cover a lot of land, saving a lot of money. What the cadres are saying is really what we're thinking." Wu Yu’geng said, "It can really be seen that the cadres have changed... I've long seen that this house soil should be moved... In the past, the cadres didn't say anything, so we didn't dare to mention it." The next day, everyone started delivering the house soil to the fields. For example, Li Peiwei pulled fourteen large carts in one day, covering two *mu* of land. Li Hengmao pushed fifteen trips in one day with a small cart, covering one *mu* of land. He said, "This old house soil is even better than soil from the *kang*." Zhang Liantang said to Zhang Lianrong, "We don't have livestock, so we have to take advantage of the livestock's idle time to deliver the accumulated manure to the fields." On the 24th of last month, Zhang Liantang borrowed an ox and delivered a pile of ash and soil fertilizer to the northeast fields of the village. Zhang Lianrong, Zhang Xushi, and others also borrowed livestock to deliver manure to the fields. They said, "It's much easier for the livestock to deliver manure when the ground is frozen." Under this influence, many people in the village also began to deliver manure to the fields. More than ten families in Zhifangtou, Second District, including Shi Jia’an, Shi Junling, Shi Qianchang, and Shi Mingjiang, are all planning to build houses and replace *kangs* in the spring, anticipating that they will be too busy in the spring, so they discussed helping each other to haul soil early. Shi Junxiu and others pushed out the accumulated pen ash fertilizer early, preparing to deliver it to the fields. They said, "It's much easier to haul soil and manure when the ground is frozen. We should prepare when we have time for when we are busy. We need to plan our work." Under their influence, everyone in the village is preparing to take advantage of the frozen ground to deliver manure to the fields and haul soil back home.

　　在支部具体领导下
  　东关提前送粪
    【又讯】清河三区东关村从整党后，党与群众的关系进一步的密切了，党员干部在政治上大大提高了一步，积极领导群众积肥增产。村支部在本月五日提出现在扔着的旧房土，是一部分好肥料，趁地冻、牲口闲应动员群众分送到地里。当时统计了一下，破房土、破墙土，约有一千二百多大车，能铺一、两顷地，施到地里能增收好多粮食。当即召开了个群众会，农会主任向大家提出以上意见，群众都很高兴的同声说：“好！好！光这些旧房土得铺好些地，省好些钱呀，再扔一年，一经雨就不壮了。干部说的这事真对大伙的心思。”吴玉更说：“真看出干部变了样啦……我早就看出这些房土该弄了……过去干部不说，咱也不敢提。”到了第二天就都开始往地里送开房土了，象李佩维一天就拉了十四大车，铺好二亩地。李恒茂一天用小车推了十五趟，铺好一亩地，他说：“这老房土，比炕土还壮哩。”张连堂跟张连荣说：“咱没喂着牲口，得凑牲口闲时，把积好的粪送到地里。”在上月二十四日，张连堂就借了一个牛，把一堆灰土粪送到村东北地里了。张连荣、张徐氏等也都借牲口把粪送到了地里。他们说：“凑地冻着送粪，牲口省劲大了。”这样一影响，村里很多人也都开始了往地里送粪。二区指坊头史家安、史俊岭、史乾昌、史明江等十多家，都打算春里盖房、换炕、算计着到春里活多忙不过来，早早就商量着互助拉土，史俊秀等人就提早把积好的圈灰粪推出来，准备往地里送。他们说：“地冻时拉土、拉粪省劲大了，闲时准备忙时用，做活得有计划才行哩。”在他们影响下，全村的人都准备凑冻往地里送粪，往家里拉土。
