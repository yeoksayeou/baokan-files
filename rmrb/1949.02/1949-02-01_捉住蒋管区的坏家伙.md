Catch the Bad Guys in the KMT-Controlled Areas

Dear Uncles:

　　How is your health? How many prisoners have you captured? Has the fighting been tough? We know that you have won many victories recently. We hope you will work harder to win more victories, recover more big cities, and work hard to catch Chiang Kai-shek and the Kuomintang bad guys in the KMT-controlled areas, so that we can see what these reactionaries are really like. When Beiping is liberated, it would be best to buy me a toy car to play with. I salute you.

　　捉住蒋管区的坏家伙亲爱的伯伯叔叔们：
    您们的身体好吧？您们捉住了多少俘虏？打仗辛苦了吧？最近打了很多胜仗，我们都知道了。希望您们加油多打几个胜仗，多收复几个大城市，努力些，捉住蒋介石、和蒋管区的国民党坏家伙，让我们看看这些反动派到底坏成啥样子。等解放北平的时候，最好给我买个小汽车玩。我给您们敬礼
