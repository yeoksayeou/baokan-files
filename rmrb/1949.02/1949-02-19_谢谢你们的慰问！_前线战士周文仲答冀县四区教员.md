Thank you for your condolences!
 Frontline soldier Zhou Wenzhong answers teachers from the Fourth District of Ji County

 Editor:
 　　In recent issues, your newspaper's fourth page has published many letters of condolence, which have made each of us soldiers feel happy and boosted our morale. In addition to demonstrating our fighting spirit in battle, we have no way to express our attitude to the comrades who wrote the letters. Today, I am writing a letter to reply to the teachers in the Fourth District of Ji County and ask you to help me publish it.

 　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　Zhou Wenzhong

 To Comrades Wang Cangbo and sixty-four other teachers from the Fourth District of Ji County:

 The Lunar New Year has just passed, and I wish you all good health and smooth work in the new year. Today, while I was studying, I received your letter of condolence, along with six guarantees, which gave me incomparable comfort from my long-standing concern for my family. I am writing this letter to thank you for your condolences! Since I joined the army, I have gone through the battles of Linfen, Jinzhong, and the eastern mountains of Taiyuan. Millions of people in Shanxi have been liberated, and the institutions by which Yan Xi-shan oppressed the people are about to completely collapse. This glorious front line of our army proves the improved combat effectiveness of our troops and the results of the rear's support for the front line. Only the power of our united army and people is invincible. Therefore, I hope that you, the teachers, must work hard to publicize the need to step up production and support the front line, so that our final and comprehensive victory can be guaranteed. However, these victories that I have personally experienced do not satisfy our demands. We must eliminate all resisting reactionary troops, cross the Yangtze River, and capture Chiang Kai-shek and other war criminals, so that all the people of the country can be completely liberated. This is the bounden duty of each of our soldiers. With the six guarantees you have made, our confidence is even more firm. Every soldier will never forget your hard work in the rear: educating students on the one hand, and publicizing current affairs and educating the masses on the other. How great your work is! On behalf of the soldiers in our Fourth District, I thank you and salute you. Each of us soldiers is determined to cross the Yangtze River, liberate all of China, and meet again at the celebration of the national liberation, where we will shake hands! Best regards,

                　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　Zhou Wenzhong

　　谢谢你们的慰问！
  　前线战士周文仲答冀县四区教员编辑同志：
    最近几期在贵报四版，登了许多的慰问信，使我们每个战士看了精神愉快，斗志提高。我们除了在战斗中发挥我们的斗志外，无法向写信的同志们表示我们的态度。今天特向冀县四区的教员答复一信，请帮我发表。
    　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　周文仲冀县四区王苍波等六十五位教员同志们台鉴：
    旧历年关刚过，祝诸位新春健康，工作顺利。今天我正在学习的时候，见到你们的一封慰问信，并且还有六项保证，使我长久挂念家庭的心，得到无比的安慰。这里特写一信谢谢你们的慰问！自我参军以来，经过临汾，晋中、太原东山诸战役，山西几百万人都得到翻身，阎匪压迫人民的机构，就要彻底崩溃。我军这一辉煌战线，证明了我们部队战斗力提高与后方支援前线工作的成果。只有我们军民团结起来的力量，才是不可战胜的。因此希望诸位教员同志，必须努力向群众宣传加紧生产支援前线，我们最后的全面的胜利，才能很有保证的到来。但象以上这些我亲身经过的胜利，并不满足我们的要求。我们要消灭一切抵抗的反动军队，打过长江，活捉蒋介石为首的战争罪犯，使全国老百姓彻底得到解放。这是我们每个战士的天职。得到你们所提的六项保证，我们大家的信心就更坚定。每个战士都忘不下你们在后方的辛苦：一方面教育学生；一方面宣传时事教育群众。你们的工作是多么伟大呀！我代表咱们四区战士，向你们致谢，敬礼。我们每个战士坚决打过长江去，解放全中国，等到庆祝全国解放的大会上，咱们再见面握手吧！此致敬礼
                　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　周文仲
