Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 14th: Shanghai News: Students in Shanghai and Hangzhou oppose the Kuomintang's forcing them to move south. As early as when the Huaihai Campaign was still in progress, the puppet Ministry of Education forced schools in Shanghai and Hangzhou to move south, threatening them by saying, "If you don't move south, you won't have food to eat!" However, this despicable conspiracy was crushed by the students' concrete actions. The Student Union of Shanghai Jiaotong University convened an emergency department representative meeting as early as December 3rd last year, deciding never to move the school under any circumstances and calling on comrades not to leave the school. Student organizations and departments also signed their names, requesting to store three months of food to meet emergency needs. The entire staff and students of Zhejiang University in Hangzhou passed a resolution not to move south with an overwhelming majority of 96%, launched a "food storage movement," stored three months of food, and organized a "school protection group" to prevent the Kuomintang bandits from destroying the school.

Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 14th: Nanjing News: The Nanjing Kuomintang bandits continue to persecute the people. The Kuomintang secret agents' persecution of students has intensified. The secret agent students of Central University have been issued pistols by the secret service, openly monitoring and intimidating ordinary students in the school. A student at the school was recently arrested and imprisoned by secret agents for no reason. The people of Nanjing have launched constant resistance against the Kuomintang bandits. The spokesperson of the puppet Nanjing Garrison Headquarters also admitted in a conversation on the 2nd of this month that labor strikes and student strikes occurred frequently in the city, threatening to "severely punish" striking workers and students. Tang Enbo, the puppet commander-in-chief of the Jinghu-Hangzhou garrison area, recently issued a "hand order" to close down a newspaper in Nanjing. The Kuomintang army stationed in Pukou, across the river from Nanjing, looted the residents, emptying their grain and furniture, forcing the residents to flee, turning the town into a dead city.

Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 14th: Shanghai News: On the 10th of this month, a disturbance broke out in Shanghai involving three thousand Northeast refugee civil servants and lower-ranking Kuomintang military officers. These refugees were deceived by the Kuomintang into leaving their homes, but after arriving in Shanghai, they were abandoned by the Kuomintang authorities. The relief funds originally promised to them were not issued, leaving them in a situation where they could not survive. They then collectively stormed the puppet Central Bank to demonstrate and petition, demanding the issuance of relief funds. The puppet Shanghai Garrison Headquarters dispatched a large number of military police to suppress them by force, but after they were determined to persist for the entire day, the Kuomintang municipal authorities were finally forced to agree to their request for relief funds.

　　沪杭学生拒绝南迁
  　三千东北流亡职员示威请愿
    【新华社陕北十四日电】上海消息：沪、杭学生反对国民党强迫他们南迁。早在淮海战役尚在进行时，伪教育部即迫令沪、杭各学校南迁，并威胁他们说：“不南迁就没有饭吃！”但此种卑劣阴谋为学生们的具体行动所粉碎。上海交通大学学生自治会去年十二月三日即曾召开紧急系科代表大会，决定在任何情形下决不迁校，号召同志不离校。该校学生社团及各系级并纷纷签名，要求储粮三个月，以应急需。杭州浙江大学全体职员学生以百分之九十六的极大多数通过不南迁的决议，展开了“储粮运动”，已储藏了三个月的粮食，并组织了“保校团”，防止国民党匪帮破坏学校。
    【新华社陕北十四日电】南京消息：南京国民党匪帮继续残害人民。国民党特务对学生的迫害，变本加厉，中央大学的特务学生们已由特务机关发给手枪；在校公开监视及威吓一般学生，该校一位学生近日竟被特务无故逮捕下狱。南京人民曾对国民党匪帮掀起不断反抗，伪南京卫戍司令部发言人，本月二日谈话中亦承认该市工潮学潮迭，威胁要对罢工工人和罢课学生“予以严惩”。伪京沪杭区警备总司令汤恩伯最近并以“手令”将南京一家报纸封闭。驻在南京对岸的浦口镇上的国民党军队则对居民大肆抢掠。粮食和家具被抢一空，居民被迫大逃走。致该镇已成为一座死城。
    【新华社陕北十四日电】上海消息：本月十日上海爆发了三千东北流亡公务人员和国民党下级军官的骚动。这些流亡者是被国民党欺骗离开家园的，到上海后则被国民党当局弃置不顾，原来允许发给他们的救济金都不发给了，使他们陷于无法生活的困境。他们随于该日集体冲进伪中央银行示威请愿，要求发给救济金，伪上海警备司令部派了大批军警对他们实行武力镇压，但在他们决心坚持了一整天之后，国民党市当局终被迫答应了他们对救济金的请求。
