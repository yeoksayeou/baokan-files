【Jizhong News】The Nan Kouli Village Cooperative Society in Wenxin County is now putting all its efforts into large-scale production and spring plowing preparations. On the thirtieth day of the twelfth lunar month last year, the cooperative held three internal cadre meetings in a row to discuss business policies and specific work plans for the first half of this year. The meetings decided that the main business in the future would be to support the agricultural production of cooperative members through supply and marketing methods. The first step was to repair farm tools and purchase livestock. On the tenth day of the first lunar month, the cooperative purchased a batch of raw materials for manufacturing farm tools from Tianjin: more than a thousand kilograms of iron wire as thick as broad beans, intended for making small iron rakes (for rice planting), making iron nails, etc.; and fifteen large iron plates, ready to make large and small hoes, large and small iron shovels, sickles, etc. The cooperative has a carpentry team of four people (who have now learned ironwork) specializing in manufacturing and repairing farm tools. Before the New Year, they had already made 50 harrows, 6 carts and buckets, etc. Now they have repaired 2 large carts, 11 small carts, 2 seed drills, 6 harrows, and 5 spinning wheels. The price of repairing farm tools for cooperative members is one-third cheaper than that of ordinary carpenter shops. Now they have also bought a part of the wood, ready to build small fishing boats and water buckets; they also plan to go to Tianjin around the Qingming Festival to buy twig brooms and to Zuo Gezhuang to buy reed mats, etc. This village is very short of livestock. Under the support of the county promotion society, Guo Mingyuan and Guo Zhongliang were sent to Xuanhua with native cloth (products of the cooperative members) worth 1.6 million yuan (People's Currency) to exchange for livestock. In addition, in order to produce fertilizer, people were sent to the north of the Daqing River to buy 40 piglets, ensuring that every household has pigs this year, and that every pig has a pen. In terms of agricultural production, some cooperative members have freely formed four mutual aid groups, and each group has democratically elected group leaders and deputy group leaders, and stipulated the system of labor allocation. They are also preparing to build more than 70 rice ponds for joint cultivation. Other agricultural production cooperative groups will be gradually organized.

【Another News】The Shen County Promotion Society actively helps farmers prepare for large-scale production and has formulated the following production plan for the future: 1. Actively transform the old village cooperatives so that each village cooperative becomes a reliance for the life and production of its members. 2. Strengthen the support for the development of oil mills, flour mills, and pocket making industries, promote products to the Zhangjiakou area, and exchange them for livestock. 3. Organize blacksmith shops and support woodworking factories to manufacture a large number of farm tools. 4. Organize well-drilling teams, repair and buy waterwheels, and develop water conservancy. At the same time, in order to mobilize the masses to grow more cotton, peanuts and other special crops, the county cooperative has prepared 30,000 kilograms of cotton seeds, 50,000 kilograms of peanut seeds, and 14,000 kilograms of other varieties, ready to be lent to farmers.

【Another News】In order to develop water conservancy, the Zhao County Promotion Society purchased a large number of locust wood boards from Yuanshi and Qinhuang areas for the masses to make waterwheel buckets and waterwheel frames. They are now being loaned to farmers. In Sixin Village alone, 241 waterwheel bucket materials and 6 water tray materials have been loaned out. Now the masses are actively assembling them.

    组织工匠修置农具
    推销产品换回牲口
    【冀中讯】文新县南叩里村合作社，现正用全力投入大生产与春耕准备工作。该社于去年腊月三十日，连着开了三次社内干部会议，讨论经营方针和今年上半年的具体工作计划，会议决定今后主要业务是以供销方式扶植社员的农业生产。首先进行了修置农具和购买牲口。正月初十，合作社就由天津买来了一批制造农具的原料：黄豆粗的铁丝千余斤，打算制小铁耙（种稻子用）、打铁钉等，大铁板十五块，准备造大小镐、大小铁锨、镰刀等。合作社有四个人的木作股（现已学会铁工活）专门制造和修理农具，年前已制出耠子五十张，小车六辆及水桶等，现又修理好了大车两辆、小车十一辆、耧两张、耠子六张、纺车五辆。与社员修理农具比一般木匠铺价钱贱三分之一。现又买下了一部分木料，准备造捕鱼小船和打水桶；还打算在清明节前后到天津去买杈子扫帚及到左各庄一带买苇席等。这村牲口很缺，在县推进社扶植下，派了郭明元和郭忠良，带着价值一百六十万元（人民币）款的土布（社员的产品），到宣化一带去换回牲口。另外为着造肥，派人到大清河北去买四十个小猪，保证今年做到家家有猪，有猪必有圈。农业生产方面，已有一部分社员，自由结合成了四个互助组，各组又民主推选了正副组长，规定了拨工齐工制度。并准备打稻池子七十多个，合伙耕种。再逐渐组织其他的农业生产合作小组。
    【又讯】深县推进社积极帮助农民准备大生产，特制订了今后的生产计划：一、积极改造旧村合作社，使每个村社都成为社员生活生产上的依靠。二、加强扶助油坊、粉坊、口袋业的发展，向张家口一带推销产品，换回牲口。三、组织铁匠炉，扶植木工厂，大量制造农具。四、组织打井班，修买水车，开展水利。同时为了发动群众多种棉花、花生等特种作物，县社已准备好棉籽三万斤，花生籽种五万斤，其他品种一万四千斤，准备贷给农民。
    【又讯】赵县推进社为了发展水利，从元氏、秦皇一带购买了大批槐木板，供给群众做水车斗子与水车架子用。现正在向农民贷发，仅四辛店一村就贷了水车斗子料二百四十一个，水盘料六个。现下群众都在积极的装制。
