　　Opinions of the 11th CPC Jizhong District Committee on Launching a Mass Cultural and Artistic Movement

　　(1) Based on the main achievements of the past half-month of work, it is because the county-level Party committees have attached importance to the leadership of cultural and artistic work. In the establishment of rural cultural and artistic organizations, the county Party committees of Shenxian, Donglu, Jinxian, Wuqiang, and Luancheng have all personally guided the work, and Comrade Gao Zhi, Secretary of the Shenxian County Party Committee, has often inspected the work. This shows that the cultural and artistic movement in various counties has laid a foundation. However, at present, it is even more necessary for the counties to effectively implement the spirit of attaching importance to leadership in this work quickly to the district and village levels, so that everyone considers it as cultural and artistic work, in order to create the possibility of a mass cultural and artistic movement.

　　(2) The establishment of county and township cultural and artistic federations increased from one county, Shenxian, before January 8th to four counties (Shenxian, Shulu, Jinxian, and Ningjin) by the 24th. Later, Luancheng, Gaocheng, Wuqiang, and Xinji also successively established preparatory committees. According to statistics from seven counties, the number of artists with leadership roles in rural cultural and artistic work increased to 11 committee members, 26 cadres (including 3 representatives from old opera troupes), and 6 representatives from school amateur drama troupes, for a total of 43 people. These are assistants and backbones for leading and launching the mass cultural and artistic movement. In the future, it is necessary to pay attention to the leadership of rural cultural and artistic federations and the training and education of members, in order to effectively carry out the mass cultural and artistic movement. Each county should also gradually establish rural cultural and artistic organizations universally based on the county's cultural and artistic foundation and the conditions of the artists while leading and launching this work.

　　Regarding the establishment of branch offices of rural cultural and artistic federations, according to the experience of Shenxian and Shulu, small groups can be temporarily established in the initial stage. The group leader is preferably an artist with good conditions, so as to connect, guide, train and educate the artists. In areas with a good foundation for cultural and artistic work and suitable conditions, branch offices can be established on a trial basis with emphasis, but they should not be established universally. After the key establishments have found experience, they can be promoted.

　　(3) Constantly hold cultural and artistic symposiums to implement cultural and artistic guidelines and policies, enlighten and improve the consciousness of artists, and through discussions, use the method of masses educating masses to clarify ideas and transform the simplistic art and disregard for policies errors of some old artists, so that they serve the people and the new society. At the Ningjin cultural and artistic symposium, this method was used, which greatly changed the old artists' idea of hoping to approve more performances of old operas before the meeting. Due to the enlightenment of comparing the policy with the actual situation, in mutual debates, the masses educated the backward elements, and in a spirit of unity, they accepted the task of serving the propaganda and education work for the new society. This has played a great role in the change of the Ningjin old opera performance style, and all counties should adopt it.

　　(4) Overcome the current phenomenon of lack of organization and discipline in the propaganda and education departments that do not conscientiously study and implement the instructions of the superior Party committee, and establish a strict system of requesting instructions and reporting. The District Party Committee and the Propaganda Department of the District Committee have repeatedly emphasized the vigorous development and establishment of new drama troupes, and the transformation, education, and necessary restriction of old operas. However, some counties neither have new drama troupes, nor do they plan and lead their cultivation and establishment. Even the new drama troupe in Wuqiang in the past had a reverse phenomenon of turning to perform old operas. These situations show that the propaganda and education departments do not thoroughly study the instructions of the superior Party committee and do not thoroughly implement them. The reporting system is better in Wuqiang, Jinxian, and Shenxian, but some counties do not report cultural and artistic work at all. This phenomenon must be conscientiously overcome in the future.

　　(5) Creation problem: Creation is the key to launching a cultural and artistic movement. Without creation, the movement has no content. Therefore, each county should mobilize cadres, teachers, rural artists, drama troupes, etc. to write a large number of scripts through various organizations, and county and district cadres should provide specific guidance with emphasis (such as content, policy, etc.). The content should focus on reflecting the joy of farmers after obtaining land certificates, uniting production and supporting the front lines. At present, it is still necessary to create works that reflect the new atmosphere of the countryside after the great land distribution. In the future, each county should create at least five performable scripts each month, in any form. After the county has reviewed and approved them, one copy each can be sent to the sub-district and the newspaper for promotion.

### 冀中十一地委关于开展群众文艺运动的意见

　　冀中十一地委关于开展群众文艺运动的意见
    （一）根据半月来工作中的主要收获，是由于县级党委重视了对文艺工作的领导。在建立乡村文艺组织中，深县、东鹿、晋县、武强、栾城等县委均亲自指导，深县县委书记高志同志并经常检查，这说明各县文艺运动已打下基础。不过目前更须要各县把重视领导这一工作的精神，迅速有效的贯彻到区、村，使大家都作文艺工作，才能造成群众文艺运动的可能。
    （二）县乡文艺联合会的建立，在一月八日前，由深县一个县，到二十四日增至四个县（深县、束鹿、晋县、宁晋）以后栾城、藁城、武强、辛集也先后建立了筹备会。据七个县统计，增加乡村文艺工作领导的艺人，计委员十一人，干事二十六人（包括旧戏团代表三人），学校业馀剧团代表六人，共四十三人。这是领导开展群众文艺运动的助手与骨干，今后必须注意对乡村文艺联合会的领导与成员的培养教育，以便有力的开展群众文艺运动。各县并应根据本县文艺基础、艺人条件，在领导开展这一工作中，逐步达到普遍建立乡村文艺组织。
    关于建立乡村文艺联合会区分会问题，根据深县、束鹿经验，在初步建立时，可暂设小组，组长最好是条件好的艺人，以便连系指导与对艺人的培养教育。在文艺工作基础较好的地区，条件适合，可有重点的试设分会，但不应普遍建立。等重点建立找出经验后，再为推广。
    （三）不断召开文艺座谈会，贯彻文艺方针与政策，启发提高艺人的觉悟，通过讨论，以群众教育群众的方法，搞通思想，改造某些旧艺人的单纯艺术、不管政策的错误观点，使其为人民服务，为新社会服务。宁晋这次文艺座谈会上，运用这样方式，大大转变了开会前旧艺人希望批准多演旧戏的念头。由于启发了以政策对照实际情况，在互相辩论中，群众教育了落后分子，并在团结一致的精神下，接受了为新社会宣教工作服务的任务。这对宁晋旧戏演唱风气转变上，起了很大作用，各县应加采用。
    （四）克服目前宣教部门中不认真研究执行上级党委指示的无组织无纪律现象，树立严格请示报告制度。区党委、地委宣传部曾一再明确强调大力发展建立新剧团，改造教育与必要的限制旧戏。但有些县份既没有新剧团，也不去有计划有领导的培养建立。甚至武强过去的新剧团有转向演旧戏的倒转现象，这些情况，说明宣教部门研究上级党委指示不深刻，贯彻不彻底。报告制度以武强、晋县、深县较好，有的县根本不报告文艺工作，这种现象今后必须认真克服。
    （五）创作问题：创作是开展文艺运动的关键，没有创作，运动就没有内容。因此各县应通过各种组织去发动干部、教员、农村艺人、剧团等大量编写，县区干部应有重点的具体帮助指导（如内容、政策上等），内容以反映农民得到土地证后的翻身快乐，团结生产与支援前线为主。目前仍需创作伟大平分后的农村新气象的作品。今后各县每月至少创作五篇能演出的写作，形式不拘。经县审查好的，可寄分区、报社各一份，以便推广。
