　　Locomotive No. 1535 Starts Again
　　Li Yufeng, Wang Qiugui, Yao Dakou, A Record of Repairing the Locomotive
　　Li Yufeng, a machine shop foreman at the Shijiazhuang Railway Bureau's Locomotive Depot, through three days of spare-time research and the concerted efforts of Wang Qiugui and Yao Dakou, brought the MGD1535 locomotive, which had been immobile for eleven years, back to life, adding a treasure to the people's own railway.

　　During the enemy-puppet period, this locomotive had been sitting idle in a large factory for ten years because the handle of the reversing gear (i.e., the reversing shaft) could not be moved. If its boiler hadn't been able to provide heating, the Japanese would have discarded it as scrap metal long ago. After the Kuomintang took over, they couldn't get it running either, and it continued to be used for heating. After liberation, this piece of the people's property had been sent to the factory twice, but even after leaving the factory and arriving at the locomotive depot, it still couldn't be moved without two people's strength.

　　On the 5th of this month, it arrived at the locomotive depot for the second time from the large factory. The responsible comrade from the factory said, "If it still can't be moved, please have the locomotive depot inspect it to find out what's wrong and repair it." Initially, the workers at the locomotive depot thought it couldn't be done; everyone was also quite busy, so no one paid attention to it. At this time, machine shop foreman Li Yufeng was very unconvinced. He thought: We should take good care of our own property. In the past few days, he had been running to the locomotive during his spare time to examine it carefully.

　　On Sunday, the 20th of this month, he led Wang Qiugui and Yao Dakou to the locomotive and said to them, "The reason the handle can't be moved is that the return spring of the reversing gear is weak. Let's try to replace it. If it works, great; if not, we'll leave it at that." So the three of them started working. On the 21st, after finishing their own work, they went straight to the locomotive. Normally, on a good locomotive, when the reversing gear handle is pushed forward, the slider of the sector plate falls down (the downward force is great, so it easily falls down), compressing the return spring, and the locomotive runs forward. If the handle is pulled backward, the slider of the sector plate is pushed up by the force of the return spring, and the locomotive reverses. But on the MGD1535 locomotive, it took the strength of two people to pull the handle, so the locomotive could only run forward and couldn't reverse.

　　After painstakingly researching the issue, Comrade Li Yufeng was determined to find a way to replace the return spring. He thought: If we reverse the function of the spring, so that pushing the handle causes the spring to expand and the sector plate slider to fall down, the locomotive will run forward, and pulling the handle backward will cause the spring to recoil and return to its original state. This force will be enough to push the sector plate slider up, and the locomotive can reverse. Old Li's idea was correct. But if the center rod of the spring, the point of force, isn't moved upward, a considerable amount of force will still be required. Therefore, he replaced the original spring center rod, moving the point of force up by twenty hao (a unit of length), changing the ratio of the distance between the force-supporting point and the load-supporting point. At the same time, to ensure the return spring had enough force, he replaced it with a heavy-duty spring. Therefore, the spring box needed hangers on both sides, so he also replaced the spring box. One morning, he, Wang Qiugui, and Yao Dakou replaced everything according to their plan, and the result was a successful test.

　　A few days ago, the reporter saw this forty-year-old foreman, smiling as he rode this locomotive—once regarded as scrap by the enemy-puppets, but now running back and forth on the tracks—and saying, "The railway is now our own property, how can we not be energetic!"

　　一五三五号机车又开动了
    李裕丰、王秋贵、姚大叩、修理机车记
    石家庄铁路局机务段机器匠领班李裕丰，在三天工作余暇的钻研并和王秋贵、姚大叩两人协同一致的努力，使十一年来动弹不得的ＭＧＤ１５３５号机车又虎生生的在铁路上跑开来，给人民自己的铁路添进一宗财富。
    该机车在敌伪时期，因为回动装置（即逆转轴）的手把打不动，在大厂里躺了十年。要不是它的里锅炉能烧暖气，日本人早就把它仍进废铁厂了。国民党劫收后，也没法动它，仍然用它烧暖气。解放后，这份人民的财产曾经进过两次厂，但出厂到了机务段，要是没有两个人的劲儿仍然不能把动它。
    本月五日，它第二次从大厂到了机务段。大厂负责同志说：“如果还把不动就请机务段检查出毛病来再修理。”最初，机务段的工友们都认为没法办；大家又都挺忙，所以没人理它。这时机器匠领班李裕丰很不服气，他想：应该把咱们自己这份家当干好。前几天，他在工作余暇便跑到机车旁边去仔仔细细地检视。
    本月二十是星期天，他领着王秋贵和姚大叩到机车那儿去给他俩说：“手把把不动是回动装置的复原弹簧没劲儿，咱们想法把它换一换。要是行了，就成，不行就作罢论”。于是他们三人就开始干起来。二十一日，他们自己的活儿干完了，他们就一直上机车那儿。本来一般好的机车，回动装置的手把要是往前推发动机关月牙板的滑子就往下落（往下落的力量大，所以容易落下去），压缩复原弹簧，车就往前跑。要是把手把往后拉，借复原弹簧的弹力，月牙板的滑子便跑了上来车于是往后退。但ＭＧＤ１５３５机车的手把没两个人的劲儿就拉不动，因此机车就只能往前跑，倒不过来。
    李裕丰同志在苦心钻研后，便一心一意设法换复原弹簧，他想：要是把弹簧的作用翻个转儿，一推手把，使弹簧伸开，月牙板滑落下去，车往前跑，往后拉弹簧有复原劲儿，它便会拼拢回复原状，这股力量足以使月牙板的滑子爬上来，车就可以往后退了。老李想很对。但要是弹簧的中心杆这个重点不往上挪，力点仍然还得用相当大的劲儿。因此他又把原来的弹簧中心杆换了，把重点挪上去二十耗，变更力支持点距离和支重两点距离的比率，同时，要复原弹簧的劲儿足，他把它换成头根，因此，弹簧箱两边得有挂的，于是他又把弹簧箱也换了。一天上午，他和王秋贵、姚大叩三人便把它按自己的计划通通换上，结果一试成功。
    记者前几天看到这位四十多岁的领班，他蹬着这具敌伪视同废铁，而现在却正在铁道上来回倒车的机车笑着说：“铁路现在是咱们自个儿的家业啦，干起来怎不带劲头儿呢！”
