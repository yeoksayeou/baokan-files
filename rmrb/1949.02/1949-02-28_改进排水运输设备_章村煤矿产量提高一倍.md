　　Improved Drainage and Transportation Equipment
  　Zhangcun Coal Mine Doubles Production
    [Taihang News] After improvements to its engineering construction at the beginning of this year, the Zhangcun Coal Mine, under the Taihang Industrial Company, has doubled its production. The average daily output has increased from 200 tons to 400 tons, and labor has been greatly saved. In the past, the mine's production increase was limited due to imperfect engineering construction. In order to increase production, save manpower and materials, and provide sufficient fuel to the masses, the leadership decided to improve engineering construction while maintaining production. After more than a month of efforts by all employees, remarkable achievements have been made in the following areas:

    First, the main roadway and the shaft were repaired. The main roadway under shafts one and two was under pressure from the strata, preventing coal baskets from being pulled into the main roadway, making coal loading very inconvenient. Support timbers also could not be pulled directly into the main roadway and had to be sent in one by one, wasting manpower and time. After this repair, both the support timbers and coal baskets can be smoothly sent into the main roadway. As a result, the output per shift (calculated for twelve hours) has also increased from 380 large baskets to 510 large baskets (600 catties per basket).

    Second, the drainage equipment was improved. The pumps draining water from shafts one and four used to draw water from the underground water storage pit, which was often clogged by coal mud, requiring a three-day shutdown every half month to excavate it. The two shafts had to shut down for twelve days a month to dig out the silt from the water storage pit. If 200 tons less were produced per day, a total of 2,400 tons of coal would be lost in twelve days. At the same time, the coal mud and wood chips in the water pit caused the water pump suction pipes to be frequently blocked, preventing the pump from draining water smoothly, which greatly affected production. During this improvement, a special reservoir was built at the bottom of the slope in shaft one, so that the water from the upper slope main roadway and the shaft would automatically flow into the pool. Two layers of grates were installed on the pool to prevent coal mud and wood chips from flowing into the pool, which not only ensured smooth drainage but also eliminated the need to stop work to dig mud.

    Third, the above-ground and below-ground transportation was improved. In the past, underground transportation relied entirely on people pulling baskets. Because the baskets were large, they had to be carried by young, strong, and skilled workers, but such workers were in short supply, which often affected production. During this improvement, light rails were laid on the main roadways on flat ground to facilitate coal pushing. Areas with slopes were converted to man-powered winches, which greatly saved labor. After the light rail transportation was installed in shafts one and two, efficiency increased by one and a half times, and labor was reduced by half. In the past, twelve people per shift could only transport 180 baskets, but now eight people can transport 256 baskets. Shaft four has an eighty-meter downhill slope. In the past, each person transported an average of 1.3 tons of coal per day. After converting to a man-powered winch, even a new worker can produce 2.3 tons. The most important result of this improvement is that it solved the difficulty of lacking young, strong, and skilled workers. In terms of above-ground transportation, the previous method of pushing large baskets with flat cars was changed to pointed transportation, saving one-third of the labor.

### 改进排水运输设备　章村煤矿产量提高一倍

　　改进排水运输设备
  　章村煤矿产量提高一倍
    【太行讯】太行实业公司所属章村煤矿，于今年年初改进工程建设后，产量提高一倍，每日平均产量由过去的二百吨增至四百吨，并大大地节省了劳力。该矿过去由于工程建设上不够完善，限制了产量的增加。领导上为增加生产节省人力物力，供给群众足够的燃料，便决定一面坚持生产，一面组织力量改进工程建设。经过全体职工一个多月的努力，在以下几方面做出了显著成绩：
    首先将大行道与井筒加以修建。一、二号井筒下的大行道因地层的压力，使运煤大篓不能拉进大行道里，装运煤时很不方便；架木也不能直接拉进大行道，必须一根一根的往里送，浪费人力、时间很大。这次修理后，使架木和大篓都可顺利的送到大行道里。因此每班（十二小时计）产量也由过去的三百八十大篓提高到现在的五百一十大篓（每篓六百斤）。
    其次是改进了排水设备。一、四号井上排水的水泵，过去是利用井下畜水坑抽水，这样常常被井下的煤泥淤塞，半个月左右即需停工三天挖一次，两个井筒在一个月内就得停工十二天，挖蓄水坑的淤塞物，如一天少出二百吨，十二天共少出煤两千四百吨。同时水坑内因煤泥木片等物的淤积，水泵抽水管常被阻塞，使水泵不能顺利排水，影响产量很大。这次改进中，便在一号井下坡处做了一个专门蓄水池，使上坡大行道及井筒的水，都自动流入池中，并在水池上设置了两层水篦子，使煤泥木片等东西不能流入池内，这样既使排水顺利，又不用停工挖泥。
    再次就是改进了井上、井下的运输。过去井下运输全靠人拉篓，因篓大必须由年青力壮的熟练工人负担，但此种工人十分缺乏，因而常常影响生产。这次改进中，在平地上的主要行道上都铺上了轻便铁轨，以便推煤。有坡的地方改成了人绞车，这样节省劳力很大。一、二号井改成了轻便铁路运输后，效率较前提高一倍半，节省劳力一半。过去一班十二人只可运输一百八十篓，现在八人可运煤二百五十六篓。四号井是八十米下山坡，过去每人每日平均运煤一吨三，改成人绞车后，一个新工人也可出二吨三。这种改进的最主要结果是解决了缺乏年青力壮而又需要熟练工人的困难。在井上运输方面也把过去平车推大篓的办法改成尖运输，节省了劳力三分之一。（沙河章村煤矿）
