[North Yue News] Zhāng Bǎodàn from Liánghédōng Village, Jǐngxíng Eighth District, is twenty-two years old this year. He volunteered for the army last spring and has performed three meritorious services at the front. When the masses in the village learned that Bǎodàn had performed another meritorious service on the Píngsuí Line, they held a celebration meeting in the village on January 9th. They sent a plaque to Bǎodàn's family, hired a music band to play, and carried a lacquered wooden plaque to hang above Bǎodàn's front door. Bǎodàn's father said, "In the old society, only wealthy families had plaques hung. Now we have a plaque hung on our door; we are truly glorious. This is better than giving me a few bags of millet. The millet will be gone after we eat it, but the plaque will be passed down for eternity. My wife and I will write to our son at the front, telling him not to come home until he defeats Chiang Kai-shek."

[Píngshān News] The Communist Youth League of Lǐjiāzhuāng, Píngshān Eighth District, initiated a movement to comfort military families. On the twenty-third day of the twelfth lunar month, the League members gathered and listened to the elementary school teacher talk about the victory on the Píngjīn front. Everyone was so happy that they wanted to jump. One League member suggested that, with the League members as the backbone, they should mobilize the youth and children of the whole village to carry out a movement to comfort military families and write letters of support to the soldiers at the front. This proposal was supported by everyone. First, they collected firewood and distributed it to poor military dependents and martyrs' families. On the 25th alone, they collected two thousand catties of firewood.

The League members, together with the elementary school students, wrote letters of support to the soldiers on the Píngjīn front. By the 24th, they had written and sent eleven letters. They planned to collectively pay New Year visits to military dependents and cadres’ families on the first day of the Lunar New Year, and to hold a joint celebration with the village cadres for military martyrs and cadres’ families. The League will also work with the village cadres to paste Spring Festival couplets for military families.

    【北岳讯】井陉八区良河东村张保旦今年二十二岁，去年春天报名参军在前线立过三次功，村里的群众知道保旦在平绥线又立了功，于一月九日在本村召开了庆功大会，给保旦家里送匾，聘请了音乐队吹打，大家抬了一面上了漆油的木匾去给保旦家大门首挂起来，保旦的爹说：“过去旧社会有钱的人家才有人给挂匾，现在是在咱门首给挂上匾了；咱这才真是光荣。这比给我送几袋小米都强；给了米吃完没有了，给挂了匾是万古留传。俺老俩口给孩子往前方去信，打不败蒋介石不让他回家。”

    【平山讯】平山八区李家庄青年团发起慰劳军属运动。在阴历十二月二十三日，李家庄的青年团员集合在一块听到小学教员给他们讲了平津前线的胜利后，大家高兴的要跳起来，一个团员提议以青年团员为骨干发动全村青年、儿童展开慰劳军属和给前方战士写慰问信运动。这一提议得到全场拥护。首先是拾柴分给贫苦军烈属，在二十五号一天已拾二千斤。
    青年团员协同小学学生给平津前线战士写慰问信，在二十四号已写十一封转走。计划在旧历年元旦青年儿童集体给军干属拜年，协同村干部召开军烈干属开联欢会。青年团协同村干部给军属贴对联等工作。
