Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 2nd. The Kuomintang reactionary government is carrying out a new traitorous plot, sending a large number of China's valuable books and cultural relics to American imperialism. According to Shanghai newspaper reports, the Kuomintang government has decided to transport 8,600 pieces of valuable cultural relics from Shanghai to the Library of Congress in the United States, including books from the Academia Sinica, the Chinese Museum, and the Chinese Geographical Institute. The Chinese people believe that the crime of the Kuomintang reactionary government in betraying the treasures of the motherland and the US government in taking advantage of the situation cannot be tolerated. The ownership of these cultural relics belongs to the Chinese people, therefore, the Chinese people have the right to order the Nanjing Kuomintang reactionary government to immediately and effectively stop this perverse act, and to bear full responsibility for the protection of all national cultural relics within the government's controlled area. The Nanjing Kuomintang government should report the results of handling this matter to the Chinese people. Otherwise, if such national treasures fall into foreign hands, the responsible officials of the Nanjing Kuomintang government must pay compensation and will be convicted by the court.

　　南京伪政府出卖国宝
  　大批名贵文物决定运美
    【新华社陕北二日电】国民党反动政府又在进行一项新的卖国勾当，将大批中国名贵图书文物送给美帝国主义。据上海报纸消息，国民党政府已决定将名贵文物八千六百件由上海运交美国国会图书馆，其中包括中央研究院、中国博物馆、中国地理研究所等单位的图书。中国人民认为国民党反动政府这种断送祖国的国宝和美国政府这种趁火打劫的罪行是不能容许的。这些文物的所有权属于中国人民，因此中国人民有权命令南京国民党反动政府立即有效地制止此种倒行逆施，并对该政府统治区内所有国家文物负保护的完全责任。南京国民党政府应将办理此事的结果向中国人民报告。否则，如此项国家珍贵竟然落入外国，则南京国民党政府负责官员必须实行赔偿，并将被法庭判罪。
