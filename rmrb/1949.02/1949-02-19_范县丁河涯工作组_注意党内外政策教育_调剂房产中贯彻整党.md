　　Fan County Dingheya Work Group
　  Pay Attention to Party and Non-Party Policy Education
  　Implement Party Rectification in Property Adjustment
    [Ji Lu Yu Telegram] The Dingheya Work Group in the Fifth District of Fan County adhered to policy principles and implemented Party rectification while leading the masses in adjusting housing sites and houses. In checking land reform and preliminary Party rectification, Dingheya had already carried out criticism and self-criticism, united activists and relatively good elements, and then openly identified Party members, absorbing twenty-nine mass representatives, both male and female, to participate in Party rectification. However, the masses felt that some Party members' reflections were somewhat vague and not profound enough. At this time, based on the urgent demands of the masses, the leadership turned to implementing Party rectification by combining it with the adjustment of housing sites and property rights.

	Checking the past distribution of housing sites and houses revealed that most Party members had been allocated good and numerous houses, such as the village Armed Committee Director who received the landlord's eight-room brick house, while still occupying his old house. However, two poor peasant households still lived in houses that were dilapidated and small, and four landlord and rich peasant households had not been given suitable houses. After group discussions, the majority of peasants demanded that those who had taken too much immediately return it, but the Party members who had been allocated too many houses and the poor peasants did not understand this ideologically. Some Party members only emphasized the "backwardness" of wrongly struggled middle peasants and were unwilling to adjust houses, and the enthusiasm for criticism and self-criticism within the branch was not strong.

	Based on the ideological situation of the masses and Party members, the work group made a specific analysis, believing that the masses and Party members must be mobilized and elevated to the level of the Party's policy to solve the problem. The reasons why the current housing adjustment problem could not be solved smoothly were two: First, the work group unconditionally accommodated branch Party members, and the comrades leading the branch meetings wavered on the Party's policy principles. The comrades leading the mass meetings saw that most of the opinions raised by the masses were correct, but could not specifically distinguish between the different attitudes towards landlords, rich peasants, and wrongly struggled middle peasants. As a result, during the discussion of housing adjustment, the masses discussed and the branch also discussed, and the two opinions were opposed, making it impossible to solve the problem. Second, Party members' privileged thinking had not been overcome, and assistance to Party members in examining their reflections and clarifying right and wrong was very insufficient. Therefore, Party members used "ideological incomprehension" as an excuse, and could not deeply reflect, and the problem could not be solved.

	After the above analysis and inspection, the work group and the branch leadership unified their thinking and immediately corrected this phenomenon of deviating from the Party's policy line and unconditionally accommodating individual Party members. They believed that if this continued, Party members' ideological level would not be raised, the relationship between middle and poor peasants would not be improved, and the Party's correct policy could not be well implemented. Therefore, policy education was repeatedly carried out both inside and outside the Party, education on the unity of middle and poor peasants was conducted among the masses, and specific policies on how to realize house allocation were also taken to each group for discussion and analysis. In the branch, principles were also adhered to, explaining that implementing the Party's policies was a manifestation that a Communist Party member should have. In this way, the leadership adhered to the principles, and Party activists launched criticisms against Party members who did not implement the Party's policies. For example, Party member Li Yuanhui raised objections to the Armed Committee Director who had taken too many houses, and the village head (branch committee member) also raised opinions to the Armed Committee Director and the Self-Defense Captain.

	With the展开 of criticism in the branch, many Party members said: If we cannot unite with the middle peasants and violate policies, future production will also be affected. After such research, the thinking of most Party members was raised, and six Party members returned sixteen rooms they had taken too much. Under this influence, the old middle peasant's house lived in by poor peasants such as Liu Xianzhang was also returned. As for the housing sites, they were resolved in the spirit of mutual consultation. In the end, as a result of the adjustment: the poor peasants who returned houses to the middle peasants also received adjustments, the poor peasants living in dilapidated houses were also satisfied, and the landlords and rich peasants without houses were also settled, and the housing rights and housing sites were reasonably resolved. The relationship between the Party and the masses has been further improved, and the policy thinking level of Party members and the masses has also been improved.

　　范县丁河涯工作组
　  注意党内外政策教育
  　调剂房产中贯彻整党
    【冀鲁豫电】范县五区丁河涯工作组，坚持政策原则，在领导群众调剂宅基房子中贯彻整党。丁河涯在检查土地改革与初步整党中，已经开展了批评与自我批评，团结了积极分子与较好分子，并接着公开了党员，吸收了男女二十九个群众代表，参加整党，但群众对某些党员的反省，感觉有些空泛，不深刻。这时领导上根据群众迫切的要求，转向从结合调整宅基房权中去贯彻整党。检查过去宅基房子分配的情况是：大部分党员分房又好又多，如村武委会主任分到地主的八间砖房，自己的老宅子还占着，但两户贫农至今住的房子仍是又坏又少，四户地主、富农还没分给他适当的房子。经过分组讨论的结果，多数农民都要求多占的马上退出来，但多分房的党员和贫农却思想不通，部分党员光强调错斗中农“落后”，不愿调剂房子，在支部内批评与自我批评的劲头又不大。根据群众和党员的思想情况，工作组作了具体分析，认为必须把群众和党员发动起来，提高到党的政策水平上去解决。目前调剂房子问题所以不能顺利解决，其原因有两点：一、工作组对支部党员无原则迁就，领导支部开会的同志，对党的政策原则动摇；领导群众开会的同志，看到群众所提大部分意见是正确的，但却不能具体去区别对地主、富农与错斗中农的不同态度。结果在讨论调剂房子时，群众讨论，支部也讨论，两种意见对立，无法解决。二、党员的特权思想没克服，帮助党员检查反省，弄清事非作得非常不够。因之，党员借口“思想不通”，不能深入反省，问题得不到解决。经过以上这种分析检查，工作组与支部领导上统一了思想，并立即纠正了这种离开党的政策路线与对个别党员无原则迁就的现象。认为这样作下去，党员思想得不到提高，中贫农关系得不到改善，党的正确政策不能很好贯彻。于是在党内外反复进行了政策教育，在群众中进行了中贫农团结的教育，对如何实现分房中的具体政策，也拿到各组去讨论与分析。在支部中也坚持原则，说明了执行党的政策是共产党员应有的表现。这样领导坚持了原则，党内积极分子也就向不执行党的政策的党员展开了批评，如党员李元会向多占房子的武委会主任提意见，村长（支委）也给武委会主任、自卫队长提出了意见。支部的批评展开了，不少党员说：团结不了中农，违犯政策，以后生产也受影响。这样经过了研究，大部分党员的思想得到了提高，六个党员退出多占房子十六间，在这样影响下贫农刘宪章等住的老中农的房子也退还了。至于宅基则是本着双方协商的精神解决的。最后调剂的结果：退给中农房子的贫农，也得到了调整，住坏房子的贫农也得到满足的填补，没房子的地主、富农也得到了安置，房权宅基得到合理的解决。党群关系得到进一步改善，党员、群众政策思想水平也得到提高。
