　　A Ten-Day Market Report
　　(January 17th to 27th)
　　Trade General Market Information Section

　　In the past ten days, the price trends in various liberated areas have shifted from rising to stable due to the resolution of the Pingjin Campaign; however, some areas still show instability. In the North China region, the northeastern part of southern Hebei and along the Shijiazhuang-Dezhou Railway were affected by the sharp price increases in the Hebei-Luyu region in the previous ten days. This ten-day period saw an average increase of 60-70% in grain prices in this area, while other items such as cotton cloth, oil, salt, and daily necessities also increased by 20-30%. In addition, the excessive difference in grain prices between the east and west lines in the Taihang area (6.8 to 16) created an opportunity for merchants, causing prices in Changzhi to rise sharply. Prices in the newly liberated areas near Pingjin generally showed abnormal behavior. Due to the prohibition of using puppet regime currency and the insufficient amount of our currency, transactions in the market appeared in silver dollars, which affected price stability. In eastern Hebei, prices were particularly low, with grain prices being less than half of those in Tianjin (5 compared to 15). In the Northwest, since the liberation of Pingjin, merchants from the east have been purchasing grain along the PingSui Railway, causing grain prices in Zhangjiakou to rise steadily, but industrial products remained stable. In East China, Jinan and Dezhou saw a reversal from the sharp increases in the previous ten days, with prices trending downwards this ten-day period (grain prices in Jinan fell by an average of 15-16%, and industrial products fell by 12-13%). However, the upward trend in Weifang remained intense, with grain prices rising by an average of 70-80% this ten-day period, and other groceries and daily necessities also rose by 40-50%. In the Central Plains region, prices in Luoyang were generally stable, while in Xuzhou, commercial activity began after the end of the Huaihai Campaign, and prices showed an upward trend. In general, the overall price situation in the region remains high in the south and low in the north, with eastern fluctuations and western stability. In terms of commodity types, grain prices continued to lead the way, followed by cotton cloth, with other industrial products lagging behind. In addition, due to the traditional Chinese New Year during this ten-day period, oil, salt, paper, groceries and other items generally showed active price increases. The specific situation of various regions and commodities in this ten-day period is reported separately below:

　　Grain

　　In the past ten days, grain activity has remained at the forefront of all commodities. However, due to the liberation of Pingjin and the restoration of traffic on the PingSui Railway, grain from the Northwest sold well in Pingjin, which stabilized grain prices in most parts of northern North China. At the same time, it raised the originally too low grain prices in Zhangjiakou in the Northwest, reducing the difference in grain prices between the east and west lines. In the southern region, due to the end of the Huaihai Campaign, most commercial activities returned to normal and began to operate, causing price fluctuations that affected Weifang in East China, as well as the northeastern part of southern Hebei, the Shijiazhuang-Dezhou Railway and other places, where grain prices showed an upward trend. Secondly, in the Taihang area, the excessive difference in grain prices between the east and west lines led to a sharp increase in grain prices on the west line (due to merchants seizing the opportunity to rush to buy grain on the west line). In addition, other regions were generally stable with slight increases and decreases. The following is a comparison of the latest grain prices in major markets in various regions:

　　一旬商情
    （一月十七日至二十七日）
    贸总商情科
    旬来各解放区物价趋势，由于平津的解决，大部地区由上涨转向平稳；但部分地区，仍显动荡。华北区方面，在冀南东北部及石德沿线，因受上一旬冀鲁豫物价猛涨的影响，本旬该区粮食平均上涨百分之六、七十，其他棉布油盐及日用杂货等，亦上涨百分之二、三十。另外太行区因东西两线粮价差额过甚（六·八比一六）造成商人可趁之隙，使长治物价猛烈上涨。平津近郊新解放区物价一般表现不正常，由于伪券的禁用，而本币筹码不足，因而市场交易出现白洋，故影响物价不稳。冀东方面：各物特别低廉，粮食与天津相比低于二倍（五比一五）。西北方面：近因平津解放后，东边商人多向平绥沿线采购粮食，故使张垣粮食节节上升，但工业品却稳。华东济南、德州，各物由上一旬猛涨，本旬转趋回落（济南粮食平均回跌百分之十五、六，工业品下跌百分之十二、三），但潍坊涨势仍炽，本旬粮食平均上达百分之七、八十，其他杂货日用品亦上涨百分之四、五十。中原区洛阳各物一般平稳，徐州则因淮海战役结束后商业开始活动，物价呈现昂扬。总之从全区物价形势来看，仍系南高北低，东波西平。在商品种类方面，各物仍以粮食带头活动，棉布尾随起伏，其他工业品次之。另外，由于本旬正值旧历年节一般油盐纸张杂货等显呈活跃价升。兹将本旬各区各物具体情况分别报道于下：
  　粮食类
    旬来粮食活动仍为各物先锋，但由于平津的解放平绥线交通的恢复，西北粮食畅销平津，故使华北北部大部地区粮价转趋平稳，同时使西北张垣原来过低之粮价水平却向上提，使东西线粮价差额缩减。在南部地区，因淮海战役已告结束，大部商业恢复常态，开始经营活动，故使物价一度波动，因而影响到华东潍坊及冀南东北部地区，石德沿线等地粮价呈现昂挺。其次太行区，因东西线粮价差额过甚，致西线粮价猛涨（商人乘机向西线抢购粮食所致）。此外其他地区一般平稳微有升降。兹将最近各区主要市场粮价，高低比较列下：市　张　唐　天　保　石　榆　长　临　濮　徐　济　潍

    （注：单位一律斤计，货币以人民券计。）
　　棉花、土布
    旬来，棉花、土布趋势，仍随粮食起伏。临清皮棉七○·八元上涨百分之二十三，南宫皮棉七○元上升百分之三十三·五，土布九元升百分之四十，衡水穰花一一○元升百分之八十八，石庄市皮棉九五元升百分之二十六·五，土布一○·三元升百分之二十六，长治皮棉七○元升百分之四十六，土布八·二五元升百分之九·五，潍坊皮棉一○○元升百分之八十二，冀南太行两地棉价突飞猛涨比十二月下旬平均上涨百分之四十五（即四八比七○）。（单位以斤计）
  　食油、食盐
    旬来正逢旧历年节，群众需量增加，价呈普遍上升，尤以粮棉上升地区涨势特高，冀南临清食盐升百分之三十九，食油升百分之八十三，太行长治食盐升百分之十八·六，食油升百分之二十二·八，石庄盐升百分之二十八·五，白油升百分之十七·二，潍坊盐升百分之五十，食油升百分之四十九，此外其他各地亦显上升但为数不大。
    工业品
    旬来各种工业品一般平稳，惟火柴纸张因逢年节群众需量增加，价显升。石庄有光纸（令）由三七○○元升为四七○○元上涨百分之二十七，北狱火柴由七五○○升为一一○○○元上涨百分之四十七，二十支棉纱（捆）由二七○○元跌为二六七○元下跌百分之一·二。出鹿洋布（匹）由四一○○元跌为四○三○元下跌百分之一·八，石油（斤）由一二○元升为一四○元上涨百分之十七，白糖（斤）由一○○元升为一二○元升百分之二十，碱面（斤）由三四·一四元升为五六·五元升百分之六十五，张家口白洋布（匹）由二一五○元升为二二五○元升百分之四·五，有光纸由二六○○元升为三○○○元升百分之十五，石油（斤）由七二元升为八○元升百分之十一，食糖（斤）由一○○元，下跌为九○元，碱面由四○元跌为三○元。
