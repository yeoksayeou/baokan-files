Xinhua News Agency, Shenyang, 27th -- In the Northeast's public factory and mining enterprises, many workers are studying technology and improving their work. The workers' enthusiasm for studying technology is becoming more widespread and increasing, thanks to the promotion and organization of factory trade unions. Workers Liu Yutian and Wang Huibang of the Andong Paper Mill, after much research, recently successfully repaired the only large-scale No. 144 paper machine in the Northeast. After the paper machine started operating, it can now produce 20,000 catties of a kind of imitation paper every day. Employees of a mine in Rehe Province also successfully manufactured an electric drilling machine not long ago. This electric drilling machine is ten times more efficient than manual mining in the past. An engine in a power plant in Heilongjiang Province and a carding machine in a textile factory in Nenjiang Province were deemed irreparable by Japanese technicians during the puppet Manchukuo period, but now they have been repaired by the workers of the two factories. The carding machine is worth more than 2 billion Northeast currency and is currently not easy to buy. This repair by the workers will greatly contribute to the factory's textile production in the future. Wei Zengtai, an old worker at the Second Textile Factory in Liaoning Province, transformed the old twisting machine, reducing the troublesome procedures of the thread making process by two and improving the production quality. In promoting technical learning, many technical research associations, research classes, amateur night schools, remedial night schools, and other organizations have been established in various factories. The amateur remedial night school organized by the trade union of the Andong Provincial Machinery Factory, except for individual technical workers, all workers participate in the study with high enthusiasm. The first phase is about to end. The shoe factory of the Fourth Military Supplies Bureau of Andong Province uses skilled technical workers, semi-skilled technical workers, and apprentices to form technical research groups for learning. After several months, more than 500 technical workers have been trained. A factory in Andong launched a mutual teaching and learning movement, which not only improved everyone's skills but also completed a month and a half's production plan in 23 days.

　　东北各工矿职工积极钻研技术
    【新华社沈阳二十七日电】东北各公营工矿企业中，许多职工钻研技术，改进工作。职工们研究技术的积极性，经过各厂工会的推动与组织，正日益普遍和增高。安东造纸厂工人刘玉田，王惠邦等，经过多番研究，于最近将东北唯一大型的一四四时抄纸修理成功。该抄纸机开工后，现每日能产一种模造纸两万斤。热河某矿职工亦于不久前制造电动打眼机成功，此种电动打眼机较过去手工开采效率提高十倍。合江省某发电厂的一种发动机及嫩江省纺织厂的梳棉机，在伪满时代日本技师已认为无法修理，现在也为该两厂的工人修好了。梳棉机价值东北币二十亿元以上，且目前不易买到。此次经工人修复，对今后该厂纺织生产贡献巨大。辽宁省纺织第二厂的老工人魏增泰，改造了旧的捻丝机，使线丝过程减少了两道麻烦手续，且改进了生产质量。在推广技术学习中，各地工厂成立了许多技术研究会、研究班、业余夜校、补习夜校等等组织。安东省机械工厂工会所组织的业余补习夜校，除个别技术工人外，全体工友都参加学习，情绪十分高涨。现第一期即将结束。安东省军需第四局鞋厂，则以熟练技术工人、半熟练技术工人与学徒混合编成技术研究小组，进行学习，经数月后，即培养出五百余技术工人。安东某厂开展了互教互学运动，不但大家的技术都提高了一步，而且在二十三天中完成了一个半月的生产计划。
