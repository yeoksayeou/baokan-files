Xinhua News Agency, Tianjin, February 25th. The manager of the Tianjin Bohai Paper Mill delayed the resumption of work, sabotaged production, and affected the lives of workers. After the workers actively resisted, he finally agreed to resume work in the short term. Since the liberation of Tianjin, the factory manager, Yu Ximing, has been avoiding showing his face. The acting manager, Sun Shenzhi, repeatedly delayed the workers' demands for resumption of work and falsely claimed, "Work can only resume after the People's Government sends a supervisor." Until February 1st, a certain Guo Zizheng, who claimed to be a "supervisor from the People's Government," arrived at the factory and gave a "lecture" to the workers. Regarding the issue of resuming work, he also adopted a delaying attitude like the capitalists. Because the factory had been delaying resumption of work, the workers' lives had been affected. Soon, the workers saw "Supervisor" Guo spending all day eating and drinking with the managers, and they began to suspect Guo's background. On February 8th, the workers invited Guo out and questioned him: "The Communist Party works for the benefit of the workers. Why don't you care about the workers' lives?" "The People's Liberation Army endures hardship and works hard. Why are you eating meat and going to restaurants with the factory staff? You're not a supervisor sent by the People's Government, are you?" "Where exactly did you come from?" Guo was questioned into silence and finally admitted that he was not a "supervisor." After this deception was exposed by the workers, Guo has been detained by the Public Security Bureau for investigation and handling, and the factory had to agree to the workers' demands to prepare for a swift resumption of work. There is no reason for the factory's delay in resuming work. During the battle to liberate Tianjin, the factory was completely preserved thanks to the workers' protection. At that time, the managers fled without a trace, but the workers organized a factory protection team, guarding it day and night. About sixty or seventy hooligans threw grenades, attempting to rob the factory, but they were driven back by the workers using wooden sticks, bricks, and other objects.

　　津渤海造纸厂拖延复工
  　工人积极抗争获胜
    【新华社天津二十五日电】天津市渤海造纸厂经理拖延复工，破坏生产，影响工人生活，经工人起来积极抗争，始允于短期内复工。自津市解放以来，该厂经理于锡明就避不露面，代理经理孙慎芝对于工人的复工要求，百般拖延，并欺骗说：“人民政府派指导员来后才能复工。”直至本月一日，忽有一自称“人民政府指导员”的郭子正到厂，并向工人“训话”。对于复工问题，也和资方一样采取拖延态度。由于该厂一直拖延复工，工人生活已受影响。不久，工人们见“指导员”郭某整日与经理们一起大吃大喝，开始怀疑郭某来历。本月八日，工人们便把郭某请出来质问：“共产党为工人谋利益，你为什么不关心工人生活？”“解放军吃苦耐劳，你为什么和厂方的人吃肉下小馆，你不是人民政府派来的指导员吧？”“你究竟是哪里来的指导员？”郭某被追问得闭口结舌，最后承认他并不是什么“指导员”。这一欺骗经工人揭穿后，郭某已被公安局拘留查办，厂方亦不得不答应工人准备迅速复工。该厂迟迟没有复工，是没有任何理由的。因在解放天津之战中，该厂由于工人的保护，已完整保全下来。当时，经理们逃的无踪无影，但工人组织了护厂团，日夜守护。会有六七十个流氓投掷手榴弹，企图抢劫该厂，幸被工人们用木棒、砖头等打退。
