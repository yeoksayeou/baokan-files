    [Xinhua News Agency, Peiping, 26th] The first Peiping Student Congress concluded on the morning of the 24th amidst the singing of "Unity is Strength." During the three-day congress, the 206 representatives, representing over 75,000 students from 129 universities and middle schools in Peiping, through repeated discussions in groups and at the general assembly, passed resolutions on the future direction and tasks of the Peiping student movement, the constitution of the Peiping Student Union, as well as proposals to support and慰问 students participating in revolutionary work, calling on students throughout the city to launch a movement to慰劳 the People's Liberation Army, welcome representatives of the All-China Student Federation, and celebrate the establishment of the All-China Student Federation. On the third day of the congress, the student representatives, in an atmosphere of democracy and freedom, earnestly and enthusiastically elected their leadership organization—the Peiping Student Union. The main content of the directions and tasks of the Peiping student movement passed by the congress is as follows: To assist the People's Government in building a new democratic Peiping. To strive to support the Liberation War and win the early liberation of all of China. To promote the establishment of a worldview of serving the people among the broad masses of students in Peiping, to study diligently social sciences, natural sciences, and cultural knowledge; and, in the combination of theory and practice, to transform learning attitudes. To assist the People's Government in reforming the education system and implementing the new democratic education policy; and to instruct the Municipal Student Union to, in cooperation with the People's Government, organize welfare undertakings for the students. In the future, the organization of student unions in Peiping schools should generate representatives from departments, faculties and grades, and then the executive committee should be generated from the congress of representatives, so that the Student Union, the school, and the students are more closely united as one. The student representatives from fifteen schools, including Tsinghua University, Peking University, Yenching University, Normal University, Huiwen Middle School, Baiman Girls' Middle School, and the High School Affiliated to the Normal University, were elected as executive members of the Peiping Student Union.
