　　Okamura Neiji—He is a butcher who slaughtered the Chinese people and one of the major war criminals who initiated this armed Japanese invasion of China. Ever since he graduated from the Army University and became a member of the "China Desk" of the Japanese General Staff Headquarters, he began to use all kinds of conspiracies to invade China. Later, he became the "Chief of the China Section." During the Northern Expedition, he served as a military advisor to Sun Chuanfang, helping warlords to slaughter the Chinese people. At that time, he was captured by the Kuomintang army but was not punished and was released. On September 18, 1931, he again participated in the war of aggression against Northeast China. Because of his meritorious service in the invasion, Japanese imperialism promoted him to Deputy Chief of Staff of the Kwantung Army and concurrently Military Attaché to the puppet Manchukuo Embassy. He was one of the masterminds behind all the conspiracies and atrocities against China and puppet Manchukuo after the "September 18th Incident." The Japanese imperialist attack on Jehol in 1932 was planned by him. He represented Japanese imperialism in signing the aggressive "Tanggu Truce." In 1934, he became the Second Director of the Japanese Imperial General Staff Headquarters, assisting Umezu in signing the "He-Umezu Agreement." Since the July 7th Incident, he served as the "Commander-in-Chief of the North China Expeditionary Army," implementing the Three Alls Policy of loot all, kill all, and burn all. Later, he became the "Commander-in-Chief of the China Expeditionary Army." Under his command, he occupied Hengyang, Guilin, Liuzhou, and Dushan, advancing directly into Guizhou Province. Countless Chinese people were killed by him, and countless houses were destroyed by him. The loss of life and property is incalculable. However, the top war criminal Chiang Kai-shek, after Japan's surrender, revered this war criminal who slaughtered the Chinese people as an honored guest and "invited" this major war criminal to be his advisor in carrying out the anti-people war.
　　Taiwan—It is the largest island on the southeast coast of our country. Located east of Fujian Province, it is more than 140 miles from the mainland, with a population of over six million (according to the 1947 statistics) and an area of 13,900 square miles. The land is fertile, and the products are abundant, producing timber, tea, camphor, leather, sugar, rice, etc. The climate is semi-tropical. It is divided into three administrative regions: Tainan, Taipei, and Taichung. It was changed to Taiwan Province in the eleventh year of the reign of Emperor Guangxu of the Qing Dynasty. After the Qing Dynasty failed in the Sino-Japanese War in the twentieth year of Guangxu, it was ceded to Japan according to the "Treaty of Shimonoseki." The people of Taiwan were unwilling to be slaves of a conquered nation and launched a heroic resistance that lasted for several months. However, because the Qing government did not provide any assistance, it failed, and Taiwan fell into the hands of the Japanese, where it was ruled and exploited by Japanese imperialism for a full fifty years. After our country's victory in the Anti-Japanese War, it was returned to China according to the conditions determined by the "Cairo Declaration." During the Japanese rule, the people of Taiwan suffered cruel oppression and exploitation, with no freedom whatsoever, and even food and clothing were difficult to obtain. After the victory of the Anti-Japanese War, the people of Taiwan were very excited, thinking that they could finally obtain democracy and happiness. However, after the Chiang Kai-shek bandit gang government took over Taiwan, its oppression and extortion of the people were even worse than during the Japanese imperialist rule, which further aroused the indignation and resistance of the broad masses of the people of Taiwan. The "February 28th Incident" that occurred on February 28, 1947, was a great action of the Taiwanese people's armed resistance against Chiang Kai-shek's tyranny. However, because it was subjected to the bloody massacre by Chiang Kai-shek's army, the Taiwanese people's armed forces turned to the countryside and mountains to continue their struggle.

    冈村宁次——是屠杀中国人民的刽子手，是这次发动日本武装侵略中国的重要战争罪犯之一。自他从陆军大学毕业后，做日本参谋本部“中国班”班员起，就开始使用一切阴谋侵略中国，后来又做“中国科科长”，北伐时，做孙传芳的军事顾问，帮助军阀屠杀中国人民，那时为国民党军队捉住了，但却没有惩办他，便放了。一九三一年九月十八日，他又参加了侵略东北的战争。日本帝国主义因他侵略有功，第二年升任他为关东军的副参谋长兼驻伪满大使馆武官，所有“九、一八”后的对华对伪满的种种阴谋暴行，他都是主持者之一，一九三二年日帝国主义进攻热河即为他所策划。他代表日帝国主义签订侵略的“塘沽协定”，一九三四年，他又做日帝国主义参谋本部第二部长，协助梅津与何匪应钦签订了“何梅协定”。七七事变以来，他曾做“华北派遣军总司令”，实行抢光、杀光、烧光的三光政策，后又做“中国派遣军总司令”，在他指挥下侵占了衡阳、桂林、柳州、独山，直进攻到贵州省境内。中国不知多少人被他残杀了，多少房屋毁在他的手里，生命财产的损失，难以计算。但头等大战犯蒋介石在日本投降后，却把这个屠杀中国人民的战争罪犯奉为上宾，并“请”这个大战犯做他进行反人民战争的顾问。
    台湾——是我国东南沿海第一个大岛。在福建省的东方，距大陆一百四十多里，人口约有六百多万（据一九四七年的统计），面积为一万三千九百方哩。土地肥沃，物产丰富，产木材、茶叶、樟脑、牛皮、砂糖、米谷等。气候半入热带。分台南、台北、台中三个行政区。在满清光绪十一年开始改为台湾省。光绪二十年中日战争中，满清失败后，依“马关条约”割给日本。台湾的人民不愿作亡国奴，当时曾进行了几个月的英勇抵抗，终因满清政府毫不接济，而告失败，台湾随即落在日本人的手里，被日本帝国主义整整统治压榨了五十年。到我国抗战胜利后依据“开罗宣言”所决定的条件才归还中国。在日本统治时期，台湾人民受尽残酷的压迫和剥削，没有一点自由，吃穿都很困难。抗日胜利后，台湾人民很兴奋，以为从此可以得到了民主和幸福，但蒋介石匪帮政府接收了台湾以后，对人民的压迫和敲榨，比日本帝国主义统治时期有过之无不及，这就更激起台湾广大人民的激愤和反抗。一九四七年二月二十八日发生的“二、二八事件”就是台湾人民武装反抗蒋介石暴政的伟大行动，但因为遭受到蒋介石军队的血腥屠杀，台湾人民武装即转入农村和山地继续坚持着斗争。
