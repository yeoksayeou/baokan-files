　　Chahar Promotes Cotton Planting
　　Four Special Districts Plan to Plant Over 430,000 Mu of Cotton

　　[Our dispatch] Before the war, the six counties of Qu Yang, Ping Shan, Huo Lu, Zheng Ding, Xing Tang and Ling Shou, and the lower half of Jian Ping, in the Fourth Special District of Chahar Province, planted approximately 500,000 mu of cotton, producing over 75 million jin of seed cotton. The majority of farmers in the area have a habit and experience in planting cotton, and the profits obtained are also very high. Therefore, there is a saying: "One mu of cotton is equivalent to three mu of land." However, due to the low price of cotton and the impact of diseases in recent years, many cotton fields in the district have been converted to grain cultivation. According to last year's survey, only 175,000 mu were planted in the entire district, less than four-tenths of the pre-war level. Furthermore, the leadership in various counties has paid very little attention to the planting of oil crops, resulting in a sharp decline in production and a surge in oil prices, causing considerable difficulty for the military and civilians in obtaining edible oil. Last year, each jin of edible oil cost 3,000 yuan, and now it has risen to over 40,000 yuan (border currency). With the development of the victorious situation, the sales volume of cotton and the consumption of edible oil will further increase. The Special Commissioner's Office has formulated the following plan for planting cotton and oil crops throughout the special district this year:

　　It is planned that all counties in the special district will plant a total of 273,000 mu of oil crops and 435,000 mu of cotton. To complete this plan, it is necessary to increase fertilizer and solve the seed problem:

　　(1) Increasing Fertilizer: The land for planting cotton and oil crops in each county this year should be fertilized with seven large carts per mu, an increase of one large cart per mu compared to last year. Therefore, it is necessary to universally call for "one pig per household, a pen for every pig," and to build pig pens with spring kang mats, and to sweep street soil to pad pens in villages along the main roads to produce large amounts of manure; to develop the transportation of coal to solve the fuel problem in order to overcome the difficulty of firewood for fertilizer production. In addition, the promotion cooperatives in Zheng Ding, Xing Tang, Ping Shan, Huo Lu and other counties should produce large quantities of bone fertilizer, complete the supply of 60,000 jin of fertilizer bone meal for cotton and peanut and other oil crops. The promotion cooperatives in each county can also order oil cakes from oil mills as fertilizer through investment ordering to supply farmers for fertilization and cotton planting. (2) Solving the Seed Problem: The cotton varieties in each county are mixed and have many diseases. The promotion cooperatives in each county should systematically exchange and purchase high-quality cotton seeds from Zhao County and Jin County in central Hebei to supply cotton farmers. Governments and promotion cooperatives at all levels should vigorously call on the masses to implement mutual borrowing and exchange of high-quality cotton and oil crop seeds to solve the difficulty of insufficient seeds. Cadres should go deep into villages and households to publicize and mobilize the masses, to break the worries of losing money in planting cotton and the unwillingness to plant oil crops, and to complete the plan for planting cotton and oil crops throughout the special district.

### 察哈尔推广种棉　四专区计划种棉四十余万亩

　　察哈尔推广种棉
  　四专区计划种棉四十余万亩
    【本报讯】察哈尔省四专区曲阳、平山、获鹿、正定、行唐、灵寿等六县和建屏下半部，在战前种植棉花约在五十万亩左右，产籽棉达七千五百余万斤。大部地区农民有植棉习惯和经验，而所获收益也很大，故有“一亩棉三亩田”的农谚。但由于近年来棉价低微和病害的影响，全区不少棉田已改种粮食。据去年的调查，全专区只种到十七万五千亩，不及战前十分之四。又各县领导上，对油料作物的种植注意很差，产量大减，油价暴涨，军民食油很感困难。去年每市斤食油达三千元，现更涨到四万余元（边币）。随着胜利形势的发展，棉花销售量和食油用量将更增大。专署特制定今年全专种植棉花和油料作物的计划如下：
    计划全专各县共种植油料作物二十七万三千亩，植棉四十三万五千亩，为完成此项计划，必须增加肥料和解决籽种问题：
    （一）增加肥料问题。今年各县种植棉花及油料作物的地，每亩要施肥七大车，比去年每亩增肥一大车。因此，必须普遍号召一户一猪，有猪必有圈及打春炕垫圈，沿大路两旁的村庄要扫街土垫圈，大量制造圈肥；开展交通运输煤炭，解决燃料问题，以克服造肥柴草的困难。另外正定、行唐、平山、获鹿等县的推进社，应大量制造骨肥，完成六万斤肥田骨粉供给种棉及花生等油料作物使用。各县推进社并可用投资订货的方式向油坊订购油饼做肥料，供给农民施肥种棉。（二）解决籽种问题。各县棉花品种杂乱，病害很多，各县推进社要有计划的到冀中赵县、晋县等地换买优良棉种，供给种棉农户。各级政府和推进社要大力号召群众，实行互借互换优良棉种及油料作物种子，以解决籽种不足的困难。干部要深入村户宣传动员群众，打破种棉的赔钱及不愿种油料作物的顾虑，完成全专植棉与油料作物计划。
