Xinhua News Agency, Shenyang, 16th. The entire officers and soldiers of the Zeng Zesheng Department, which was ordered to be reorganized into the People's Liberation Army's Fiftieth Army, issued the following telegram at the naming ceremony:

To Chairman Mao of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China, Commander-in-Chief Zhu and Deputy Commander-in-Chief Peng of the People's Liberation Army, Commander Lin and Deputy Political Commissar Luo of the Northeast Military Region, Deputy Commander Gao, Chairman Lin of the Northeast Administrative Committee, and to all compatriots across the country:

The Chiang Kai-shek reactionary clique, colluding with American imperialism and supporting feudal forces, has launched a reactionary civil war, slaughtering the Chinese people. Since tearing up the Political Consultative Conference resolutions and the ceasefire agreement in 1946, they have dispatched large armies to launch massive attacks on the liberated areas, engaging in burning, killing, looting, and all kinds of evil deeds wherever they went. The People's Liberation Army rose up to resist and, in over two years, annihilated over three million enemy troops, laying the foundation for national victory. The Chiang Kai-shek bandit gang, terrified by the growing strength of the people's forces and the crisis of their own demise, under the instigation of American imperialism, concocted a peace conspiracy, retreated behind the scenes to direct, attempted to deceive the people, delay the war, hold onto the areas south of the Yangtze River, gain a respite, stage a comeback, and then return to destroy the people's revolutionary forces. Chairman Mao and the leaders of the CPC Central Committee discerned their treachery and issued a solemn statement on the current situation, proposing eight peace proposals, which were enthusiastically supported by all sectors of the country. The opportunity to liberate all of China is not far away.

Our army, recognizing the darkness and reaction of Chiang Kai-shek and knowing that blindly obeying his command would lead the entire army to its doom, resolutely revolted on October 17th last year and joined the People's Liberation Army. On February 1st of this year, we were ordered by the headquarters of the Chinese People's Liberation Army to be reorganized into the Fiftieth Army of the Chinese People's Liberation Army. The entire army was overjoyed upon hearing the news and wholeheartedly supported the leadership of the CPC Central Committee and the headquarters of the Chinese People's Liberation Army, supported all the resolutions and propositions of the CPC Central Committee and Chairman Mao, and supported the eight propositions of Chairman Mao's statement on the current situation. We pledge, under the leadership of the CPC Central Committee and Chairman Mao, and under the direct guidance of the Northeast Bureau and the Northeast Military Region, to intensify political rectification, transform our thinking, and strive to go to the front lines as soon as possible, vowing to eliminate the Kuomintang Chiang Kai-shek bandit gang and drive American imperialism out of China.

Since our uprising, we have received unlimited help and care from the People's Government and the masses, for which we are deeply grateful. As the grand naming ceremony is solemnly held, we extend our sincere respect to Chairman Mao and Commanders-in-Chief Zhu and Peng, the People's Government of the Liberated Areas, and all the people.

The entire representatives of the Fiftieth Army Naming Ceremony Celebration Conference respectfully salute.

　　曾泽生部全体官兵授名典礼发表通电
    【新华社沈阳十六日电】奉令改编为人民解放军第五十军的曾泽生部全体官兵，在授名典礼上发表通电如下：
    中共中央毛主席，人民解放军朱、彭总副司令，东北军区林司令员、罗副政委，高副司令员，东北行政委员会林主席并转全国同胞均鉴：
    蒋介石反动集团，勾结美帝国主义，扶植封建势力，制造反动内战屠杀中国人民。自一九四六年撕毁政协决议、停战协定以来，调派大军，大举进攻解放区，所到之处，烧杀淫掠，无所不为。人民解放军奋起抗击，二年余歼敌三百余万，奠定了全国胜利的基础。蒋介石匪帮惊惧人民力量之壮大，与自身溃灭之危机，乃在美帝国主义授意之下，制造和平阴谋，隐入幕后指挥，企图迷惑全国人民，拖延战争，据守长江以南地区，取得喘息机会，死灰复燃，然后卷土重来，摧残人民革命力量。毛主席及中共中央诸领袖洞烛共奸，对时局问题发表严正声明，提出八项和平主张，全国各阶层热烈拥护。解放全中国的时机，已经不远了。
    本军鉴于蒋介石的黑暗反动，如盲目供其驱使，必置全军于死地，乃于去年十月十七日毅然起义，加入人民解放军。今年二月一日，奉中国人民解放军总部命令，改编为中国人民解放军第五十军。全军闻讯，莫不欢跃，竭诚拥护中共中央及中国人民解放军总部对我们的领导，拥护中共中央及毛主席的一切决议与主张，拥护毛主席对时局声明的八项主张。我们誓在中共中央及毛主席的领导下，在东北局与东北军区的直接指导下，加紧政治整训，改造思想，以期早日开赴前线，誓死消灭国民党蒋介石匪帮，驱逐美帝国主义出中国。
    我们自起义以来，受到人民政府与群众的无限帮助爱护，殊深感谢。当兹授名典礼大会隆重举行之际，谨向毛主席及朱、彭总副司令、解放区人民政府及全体人民，致以亲切的敬意。
    五十军授名典礼庆祝大会全体代表同叩
