In our North China region, some counties were flooded and unable to plant wheat. Now that the water has largely receded, spring wheat should be planted as quickly as possible. Here are a few methods for your reference:

　　　　Seed Selection
When planting spring wheat, you must choose spring wheat seeds. If you use autumn wheat seeds, the seedlings will only develop roots underground without growing stems. If you plant half autumn wheat seeds, half will die and half will only develop roots. Replanting is a waste, and if you don't replant, it won't mature and the harvest will be poor, or you'll end up with a field of small, unproductive wheat. The way to distinguish between autumn and spring wheat seeds is: autumn wheat has a protruding waist, shallow grooves, and short hairs at the tail; spring wheat has a flat waist, deep grooves, and long hairs at the tail. When selecting seeds, also pay attention to choosing seeds that have not been exposed to moisture. Seeds that have been rained on and have a dark skin should not be used. Good wheat seeds will have a shiny, translucent skin, ensuring a successful crop. According to experiments at the Bohai Farm, there are three types of spring wheat seeds: 1. "Modified" wheat: After the "ninth nine" (i.e., after the winter solstice), soak any type of wheat seed in cold water every nine days, for a total of five times. This will allow the seeds to germinate and sprout roots, and they can be planted in the ground five days before "Rain Water" (a solar term). However, this method is now too late. 2. Spring wheat: Can be sown as soon as the ground thaws before the spring equinox, and can be harvested by mid-June, making it excellent for mitigating famine. 3. Naked barley: A type of unhulled barley that can be sown after thawing but before the "ninth nine" (around the spring equinox), and can be harvested by "Grain in Ear" (a solar term), taking about two and a half months. Our waterlogged areas should plant more of the latter two types of wheat to prepare for spring shortages.

　　　　Attention to Soil Properties
Spring wheat is cold-resistant and prefers moist soil when young. Low-lying areas, areas with nocturnal dampness, bay edges, riverbanks, and river beaches are most suitable for planting spring wheat because these areas are moist and the wind doesn't easily dry them out. Even if they dry out during the day, the moisture returns at night. The wind dries the surface during the day, and the dew waters it at night, preventing the soil from drying out, which allows the wheat seedlings to grow well. Windy areas and cloddy soil are the least suitable. Windy areas dry out easily, and dry out again quickly after rain. Cloddy soil prevents the shoots from taking root, and it is also exposed to the wind, so the wheat seedlings don't grow well.

　　　　Planting Method
Spring wheat should be planted early. Early planting allows the roots to develop first, absorb more nutrients, and grow better. It is best to plant during the "ninth nine," but in low-lying areas, "retreating water wheat" can also be planted, and planting around the Qingming Festival (Tomb Sweeping Day) will also allow it to mature at the same time. Spring wheat should be planted shallowly. Shallow planting allows it to easily get sunlight, and the seedlings will emerge dark. Deep planting makes it difficult to get sunlight, and the seedlings will emerge yellow, thin, and weak.

　　　　Fertilization
Spring wheat has a short growing period in the ground, so it is best to apply human manure, sesame residue, bone meal, etc. because these fertilizers are potent and quickly promote leaf and grain growth. Other fertilizers don't take effect as quickly. Spring wheat has many solid roots and few fibrous roots. Fertilizer should be applied before sowing so that the roots can grow into the fertilizer and absorb nutrients immediately, ensuring good growth. If the seeds are sown first and then fertilized, the solid roots will grow into the soil and not easily absorb nutrients quickly, resulting in poor growth.

### 怎样种春麦？

　　怎样种春麦？
    咱华北区，有些县份，因地涝了，没种上麦子，现在水都大部退尽，应该赶快种春麦。这里提出几个办法，供大家参考：
    　　　　选种
    种春麦要选择春麦种，如果用秋麦种上，麦苗光在地下打盘不拔秆；如果秋麦种对半，不论那一半都是死一半盘一半，另耩就惜，不另耩就熟不下来，收成不好，或者长一地小鬼子麦穗。秋麦和春麦种的分法是：秋麦腰凸，沟浅，尾端毛短；春麦腰平，沟深尾端毛长，选种时还要注意选择没有受潮的麦子当麦种，如遭过雨的麦皮发暗的就不能用。麦皮上油亮亮的透光，这是好麦种可以保险。根据渤海农场的试验，春麦种有三：一、是改麦：在交“九”以后，把小麦的任何一种每隔九天用冷水捞一次，共捞五次麦种就可以芽生根，“雨水”前五天种在地里。但这种办法现在已来不及了。二、是春麦：春分前刚开冻就可播种，到六月中旬就能收割，补救灾荒是很好的。三、米大麦：是一种不带皮的大麦，在开冻以后出“九”以前（春分前后）种上，到“芒种”就可以收割。前后两个半月。后两种麦子咱们水涝地区应当多种，以备春荒。
    　　　　注意土性
    春麦小时耐寒、喜湿地，洼地、夜潮地、湾边、河沿、河滩种春麦最合适，因这些地方地湿，风不容易吹干，就是白天吹干，夜里潮上来，白天受风吹，夜里喝露水，地不受干，麦苗肯长。漏风地、土柯垃地最不适合，漏风地发干，下了雨又肯干；土坷垃地顶芽不扎根，又透风，麦苗不爱长。
    　　　　种法
    春麦宜早种，早种的先扎根，吸的养料多，长的一定好，最好在“九”里种，但下洼地也可种退水麦，在清明前后种上也能一齐熟。种春麦应当浅，浅了容易得太阳光，出来麦苗发黑；种深的不容易见太阳光，出来就黄瘦不旺。
    　　　　施肥
    春麦在地里日期短，最好能施人粪，香油楂、骨粉等。因这几种肥料劲水大，容易长叶、长粒，别的肥料不容易很快见劲。春麦实根很多虚根少，应先施肥后下种，根出来就扎在肥料上，马上吸收到养料，一定长的好。先下种籽后施肥，实根扎在土上，不容易很快吸收到养料，长的一定不好。
