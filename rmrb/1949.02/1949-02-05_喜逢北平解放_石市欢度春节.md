　　Celebrating the Liberation of Beiping
  　Shijiazhuang Joyfully Celebrates the Spring Festival
    [Shijiazhuang News] This year's Spring Festival coincides with the liberation of Tianjin and Beiping, and the liberation of North China, making the people of this city even more excited. In recent days, various government agencies and organizations have been rushing to make new plaques, and workers, merchants, and citizens have been putting up Spring Festival couplets on their doors. Firecrackers began to sound at dawn, and people crowded the streets and alleys. Men and women, young and old, were all dressed in new clothes, exchanging New Year's greetings on the streets, knocking on doors to offer congratulations. Everywhere, one could hear enthusiastic laughter. Early in the morning, workers from various factories, families of military personnel from various streets, cooperative members, merchants, and disabled veterans knocked on the doors of the district governments to offer warm New Year's greetings.
    The Municipal Party Committee, the Municipal Government, the Garrison Command, and the Municipal Federation of Trade Unions sent representatives to the Qianjin, Fanrong, Guangming, and public-owned factories such as the electric light and telephone companies to extend New Year's greetings to the workers and their families. At the same time, the industry department of the Municipal Federation of Trade Unions also sent people to the four districts in the city to extend New Year's greetings to the workers in private factories. The workers and their families were very happy. They said: This year is different from previous years. Tianjin and Beiping have been taken, and the whole country will soon be completely liberated, and life will be better.
    In the Fanrong Factory, some workers partied almost all night on New Year's Eve, but on the morning of New Year's Day, they went to the trade union to pay their New Year's respects earlier than anyone else. They seemed tireless and went to various villages to visit after paying their respects at the trade union. The mother of a certain worker in the Guangming Factory affectionately told the reporter: "You are even closer than my own daughter, coming so early."
    At noon, the Yangko teams from the sixty-fifth team and other units came to the city from distant rural areas to pay New Year's greetings to all sectors of the city. At night, the main streets such as Zhongshan Road, Zhonghua Road, South Street, Daqiao Street, and Minsheng Street were brightly lit with lanterns, as if it were daytime. The magnificent new plaque in front of the Municipal Government, "Build a People's Shijiazhuang," and the victory arch of the Electric Light Company, "Resolutely Overthrow the Kuomintang's Reactionary Rule and Establish a People's Republic with the Proletariat as the Leader and the Worker-Peasant Alliance as the Main Body," and the Municipal Federation of Trade Unions'彩牌, "Carry the Revolution Through to the End, Increase Production by an Inch," attracted the attention of passersby under the brilliant electric lights. On the main streets, passersby brushed shoulders with each other, and the people in front of the broadcasting equipment were carefully listening to the Xinhua News Agency's broadcast of the CCP spokesperson's important talk ordering the Nanjing reactionary government to re-arrest and hand over Okamura Neji and detain important war criminals such as Chiang Kai-shek. The People's Education Center exhibited dozens of photos of Soviet socialist construction. The cinemas took turns showing "Democratic Northeast," and the Municipal Club organized a Spring Festival gala for the masses. According to people familiar with the history of Shijiazhuang, this year's Spring Festival is the most lively Spring Festival in the city's history.

　　喜逢北平解放
  　石市欢度春节
    【石家庄讯】今年春节，喜逢平津解放、华北解放，本市人民愈加兴奋。数日来，各机关团体赶扎新牌，工人、商户、市民家门上贴了春联。黎明爆竹就响起来，人们，拥挤在街头小巷，男男女女老老少少，都打扮一身新，街头恭喜，敲门致贺，到处都可听到热烈的欢笑声。当清晨，各厂工人、各街军属、合作社员、商人、荣军等就敲开了各区政府的大门，热烈团拜。
    本市市委会、市政府、警备司令部和市总工会等单位均派出代表分赴前进、繁荣、光明及电灯、电话等公营工厂去向职工同志和他们的家属致贺春节之喜。同时，市总工会行业部也派人分赴市内四个区去给私营工厂职工去团拜。职工同志和他们的家，都很高兴。他们说：今年不比往年，平津已经拿下来，全国也就快全部解放，日子更要好过啦。
    在繁荣厂，有的职工在除夕晚上几乎闹了一整宿，但元旦的早晨他们到工会去拜年比谁都去的早，他们简直不知道疲倦似的在工会拜年后又分赴各村串门去了。光明厂某工友的母亲亲切地告诉记者：“你们真比俺闺女儿还亲，来得这么早。”
    中午，六十五队等单位的秧歌队，从很远的乡下到市里来，给本市各界拜年。入夜，中山路、中华路、南大街、大桥街、民生街等主要街路、彩灯齐亮，如同白昼。市府门前气魄壮阔的新牌横匾“建设人民的石家庄”与电灯公司胜利拱门上“坚决推翻国民党的反动统治，建立以无产阶级为领导、工农联盟为主体的人民民主专政的人民共和国”，与总工会的彩牌上，“将革命进行到底，把生产提高一寸”，在辉煌的电灯下招引着来往行人的注视。各主要街道上，来往行人擦肩而过，各播音器前面的人们，都在用心谛听新华社广播中共发言人命令南京反动政府重新逮捕并交出冈村宁次和扣留蒋介石等重要战犯的重要谈话。民教馆里展览了好几十幅苏联社会主义建设的照片。各电影院轮番的演出“民主东北”，市俱乐部更组织了群众的春节晚会。据熟悉石家庄历史的人们说：今年春节，是本市最热闹的一个春节。  　　　　（春明、晓州）
