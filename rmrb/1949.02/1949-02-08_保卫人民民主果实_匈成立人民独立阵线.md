Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, February 5th: TASS, Budapest: The Hungarian People's Independent Front has been declared established. The Hungarian Working People's Party, Independent Smallholders' Party, National Peasant Party, Hungarian Trade Union Council, All-Hungarian Union of Working Peasants and Agricultural Laborers, Hungarian Democratic Women's League, and Hungarian People's Youth League, which constitute this People's Independent Front, jointly issued a communique on February 1st. The communique pointed out that the Hungarian National Independent Front, established under the initiative of the Hungarian Communist Party, has completed its tasks (Note: The National Independent Front was established in March 1944, when the German invaders still occupied Hungary). The consolidation of Hungarian democracy and its achievements makes it necessary to draft a new program, the task of which exceeds that of the National Independent Front. The international and domestic situation has undergone fundamental changes. This requires the democratic forces of Hungary to unite on a new basis in order to complete new tasks. The communique pointed out: We must unite our forces to defend the fruits of people's democracy, to defend peace and the independence of the motherland. We must unite the democratic forces of the whole country to build a new society without exploitation and without oppression. The communique stated: The Hungarian People's Independent Front is led by the most advanced class—the working class; it is a fighting alliance of the working class, the laboring peasants, the intellectuals who are prepared to serve the people, and all democrats. The communique briefly pointed out that the tasks of the People's Independent Front are to: ensure that Hungary is transformed into a truly People's Republic of the working people's state, unite democratic forces, achieve close cooperation between various democratic organizations, ensure the consolidation of the worker-peasant alliance under the leadership of the working class and its party, ensure the development of the Hungarian national economy on the basis of a planned economy, ensure the improvement of the living standards and cultural upsurge of the working people, and wage a stubborn struggle against the imperialist forces attempting to infringe upon Hungarian independence. The communique concluded: True democrats and patriots cannot remain outside the People's Independent Front. This front gives all democrats in the country the right to participate in state administration. All political and people's organizations participating in the People's Independent Front have decided to establish a National Provisional Committee of the Hungarian People's Independent Front and declared that they will abide by the decisions of the committee. They called on their members and all working people to unite under the banner of the People's Independent Front to complete the program of the People's Independent Front.

　　保卫人民民主果实
  　匈成立人民独立阵线
    【新华社陕北五日电】塔斯社布达佩斯讯：匈牙利人民独立阵线已宣告成立。组成这一人民独立阵线的匈牙利劳动人民党、独立小农党、国家农民党、匈牙利职工会委员会、全匈劳动农民与农业劳动者联盟、匈牙利民主妇女联盟与匈牙利青年人民联盟于二月一日联名发表公报。该公报指出，在匈牙利共产党发起下成立的匈牙利民族独立阵线，业已完成了它的任务（按：民族独立阵线成立于一九四四年三月，当时德寇还占领匈牙利）。匈牙利民主及其成就的巩固，使得草拟新的纲领成为必要，这一纲领的任务超过了民族独立阵线的纲领。国际与国内的形势业已发生根本的变化。这要求匈牙利民主力量在新的基础上团结起来，以便完成新的任务。公报指出：必须为保卫人民民主的果实，为保卫和平与祖国的独立，把我们的力量团结起来。我们必须把全国的民主力量团结起来，建设没有剥削、没有压迫的新社会。公报称：匈牙利人民独立阵线是受最先进的阶级——工人阶级领导的，是工人阶级、劳动农民、准备为人民服务的知识分子和一切民主分子的战斗联盟。公报扼要指出人民独立阵线的任务为：保证使匈牙利转变成为完全名符其实的人民共和国的劳动人民国家，团结民主力量，达成各民主组织之间的密切合作，保证在工人阶级及其政党领导下的工农联盟的巩固，保证在计划经济的基础上发展匈牙利国民经济，保证劳动人民生活标准的改善与文化的高涨，对企图侵犯匈牙利独立的帝国主义力量进行顽强的斗争。公报结语称：真正的民主分子与爱国分子，不能留在人民独立阵线之外。这一阵线予全国一切民主分子以参与国家行政的权利。参加人民独立阵线的一切政治和人民团体，业已决定成立匈牙利人民独立阵线全国临时委员会，并宣布它们将遵守该委员会的决定。它们号召它们的成员和全体劳动人民，在人民独立阵线的旗帜下团结起来，完成人民独立阵线的纲领。
