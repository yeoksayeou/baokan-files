[Ji Zhong Electric] The Cang City Advancement Society, based on the different modes of production of urban poor people and workers, has adopted different organization and support methods, and has gained several experiences:
	I. For poor urban residents who have labor but no capital, the main method is to provide loans to organize their production. Yin Yuming and his son from the South Guan District borrowed 10,000 yuan to push a cart and sell fish. In twenty days, after deducting the living expenses of their family of eight, they earned a net profit of 2,000 yuan. From December to mid-January, the Advancement Society supported a total of 272 households in different production industries such as transportation, oil sales, firewood sales, shoe workshops, and tofu workshops, with loans totaling 495,500 yuan. Because of the profits from production, 170 households repaid their loans in the same month.
	II. For small vendors with no capital, or poor, elderly, and disabled urban residents with no labor, the main method is to provide support through the sale of goods. The industrial products transported by the Advancement Society from various places are relatively cheap and are handed over to small vendors with no capital for sale. They take the goods first and pay later, or on credit. In this way, 40 poor, elderly, and disabled vendors were organized. In one month, they sold 2,000 cartons of cigarettes, earning a total of 40,000 yuan, with each person receiving 1,000 yuan, which is enough to solve the food problem for two people. In addition, it also provided 20 vendors with hat materials, cotton shoes, cloth, towels, etc., to solve their difficulty of not having capital.
	III. For small-scale production organizations and workshops that have already been organized, on the one hand, it solves their funding difficulties, and on the other hand, it is responsible for supplying raw materials and promoting finished products. For example, in addition to lending 19,300 yuan to ten households lacking capital in the shoe industry, it also provided them with 956 jin of good hemp and 1,500 jin of cotton. This reduced their exploitation by merchants when buying in small quantities. It also promoted the sale of hundreds of dozens of towels and more than a hundred bolts of wide-width cloth for the Jincheng and Rongxing towel factories.
	The Advancement Society's experiences in organizing and supporting urban residents' production are: 1. The targets of organization and support in the city are poor urban residents, workers, and small producers. Different organization and support methods are adopted according to their different production methods and difficulties. First, solve the difficulties in their life and production from the production aspect, and then gradually organize them. 2. In terms of supply and marketing, the Advancement Society initially had blindness, selling to whoever bought industrial raw materials or finished products at low prices. As a result, wealthy speculative merchants bought them, and sometimes speculative merchants sent people who had dealings with the Advancement Society to buy them on their behalf. However, factories and workshops that actually needed raw materials and small vendors who should have been supplied with finished products often could not buy the goods. In order to prevent merchants from speculating and profiteering, the supply and marketing system of the urban advancement society should be rationing. The supply of goods to poor small vendors must be done through the introduction of district cadres, and the advancement society should issue certain licenses, counted as client households of the advancement society; then, according to their daily sales volume, the goods should be allocated according to the quantity, and the price should be low, maintaining a certain profit for the small vendors. For those who are not client households of the Advancement Society, the selling price should not be lower than the market price. The supply of raw materials to mass production mutual aid small factories and workshops should also be done through the introduction of certain procedures, and then according to the daily raw material needs and finished product output of each unit in each period, the raw materials should be supplied. This not only eliminates merchants' speculation, but also allows the Advancement Society to grasp the supply figures, which is convenient for planned support.

　　怎样扶植城市劳苦群众？
  　沧市推进社取得几点经验
    【冀中电】沧市推进社根据城市贫民、工人不同的生产方式，采取了不同的组织与扶植办法，并得到几点经验：
    一、对有劳力无资本的贫苦市民，主要是贷款组织其生产。南关区的尹玉明父子俩贷款一万元推小车贩鱼卖，二十天除全家八口人吃用外，获纯利二千元。十二月一月中，推进社共扶植了运输、贩油、贩柴、鞋作房、豆腐房等不同生产行业共二百七十二户，贷款四十九万五千五百元。因生产获利已有一百七十户当月归还贷款。
    二、对无资本的小摊贩，或贫苦无劳力的孤、老市民，主要从推销货物中予以扶持。推进社从各地运来的工业品，价钱比较便宜，交给无资本的小摊贩去推销。先取货后交款，或先赊欠。这样组织了贫苦孤老的摊贩四十人。一个月卖出纸烟二千条，共获四万元，每人各得一千元，足能解决两个人的吃食。此外还供给了二十户摊贩的帽头、棉鞋、布匹、毛巾等，解决他们没有资本的困难。
    三、对已组织起来的小型生产组织和作坊，一方面解决其资金困难，同时负责供给原料及推销成品。如对鞋业除贷给十户缺资本户一万九千三百元外，还供给他们好麻九百五十六斤，棉花一千五百斤。减少了他们零买时受商人的剥削。并给金城、荣兴毛巾工厂推销毛巾百十打、宽面布百余匹。
    推进社在组织与扶持市民生产中，摸索到的点滴经验为：一、城市中组织与扶持对象是贫苦市民、工人、小生产者。根据他们不同的生产方式与困难，采取不同的组织与扶持办法。首先从生产上来解决他们的生活与生产中的困难问题，再逐渐加以组织。二、在供销上，推进社初期带有盲目性，不论是工业原料品或推销成品，谁买就卖给谁，都低价出售。结果被有钱的投机商人买去，有时投机商人并派与推进社有来往的人替他们代买。而实际需用原料的工厂作坊和应供给成品的小摊贩，往往买不到货物。为防止商人从中投机倒把城市推进社的供销制度应该是配给性的。对贫苦小摊贩货物的供给上必须经过区干部介绍，推进社发给一定证照，算为推进社的来往户；再根据其一天销货数量，照数配给，价钱从低，保持小摊贩的一定利润。凡不是推进社的来往户，卖货时一律不低于市价。对群众的生产互助小型工厂和作坊的原料供给，也应经过一定手续的介绍，再根据每个时期，每个单位日需原料多少，出成品多少，供给其原料。这样既杜绝了商人的投机，推进社也能把供给数字掌握起来，便于有计划地扶助。
