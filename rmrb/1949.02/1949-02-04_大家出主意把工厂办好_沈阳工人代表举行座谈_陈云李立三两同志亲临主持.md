Xinhua News Agency, Shenyang, 1st. Sixty-seven worker representatives from sixteen of Shenyang's largest state-owned enterprises held a symposium last month. At the meeting, the representatives reflected many situations and opinions on issues such as production recovery, worker welfare, worker learning, and employee unity. The process and results of the meeting proved that this kind of worker representative symposium is a good way to promote democratic style, strengthen the connection between leaders, managers and workers, and unleash the labor enthusiasm of the working masses. The symposium was jointly convened by the Shenyang Military Control Commission and the Preparatory Committee of the Municipal Federation of Trade Unions, and Comrades Chen Yun and Li Lisan of the Northeast Central Bureau of the CPC also attended and presided over the meeting. Because the attending representatives had previously solicited opinions from workers in their respective units, they spoke very enthusiastically. The opinions raised by the representatives mainly fell into four categories: First, regarding production recovery, representatives from more than ten units, including railways, trams, rubber, smelting, machinery, military industry, automobiles, textiles, clothing, and sack factories, put forward opinions on increasing and improving equipment and resolving difficulties in raw materials and electricity. Second, regarding worker wages and welfare, because everyone knows that today's government is the people's government, they expressed all opinions, large and small, without reservation. Among the opinions raised, some felt that wages were not assessed reasonably enough, some requested adjustments to housing, the establishment of more maternity clinics, the establishment of more grain stores, and the establishment of schools for workers' children, etc. Third, regarding worker learning, representatives proposed the establishment of technical training classes, the publication of industrial books, and the organization of tour groups to visit old liberated areas, reflecting the significant increase in the desire for knowledge among the working class after gaining political liberation. In addition, some representatives raised some opinions on the relationship between workers and staff. Finally, Comrade Chen Yun summarized the opinions of the representatives and made a concluding speech. He pointed out that this meeting was very successful. Judging from the opinions reflected by the representatives, the workers are not only concerned about wages, welfare, and other life issues, but also about production and construction issues. This shows that the working class truly possesses the spirit of being the masters of the country. Only under the People's Government will workers be so enthusiastic about the major national production and construction matters. Such meetings should be held regularly in the future. Chen also provided answers and explanations to the requests and questions raised by the representatives. He called on all employees to contribute ideas to run the factory well, increase production, and improve living standards. Comrade Li Lisan also focused on the theme of "everyone handles matters concerning everyone" and asked all workers and staff to use their wisdom and take action to develop new production undertakings.

　　大家出主意把工厂办好
  　沈阳工人代表举行座谈
    陈云李立三两同志亲临主持
    【新华社沈阳一日电】沈阳市十六个最大的国营企业单位的六十七位工人代表，于上月举行座谈会。会上，代表们对恢复生产、工人生活福利、工人学习、职工团结等问题，反映了许多情况和意见。会议的经过和结果证明这种工人代表座谈会是发扬民主作风，密切领导管理人员和工友之间的联系，发挥工人群众的劳动热情的良好方式之一。座谈会系由沈市军管会与市职工总会筹委会联合召集，中共东北中央局陈云、李立三两同志亦亲临主持。由于出席代表事先曾向各该单位的工人征求过意见，所以发言甚为踊跃。代表所提意见主要有四类：第一，关于恢复生产者，铁路、电车、橡胶、冶炼、机器、军工、汽车、纺织、被服、麻袋等十余单位的代表，都提出了增加与改善设备、解决原料及电力等困难的意见。第二，关于工人工资、生活福利者，因大家都知道今天的政府是人民的政府，所以大小意见毫无保留。所提意见中，有的感觉工资还评得不够合理，有的要求调整住宅，增设产科，多办几个粮食商店，办工人子弟学校等等。第三，关于工人学习者，有代表提出成立技术训练班，出版工业书籍，组织到老解放区的参观团等，反映出工人阶级在政治上获得解放后，求知欲望的显著提高。此外，有些代表对工人与职员关系问题提出了一些意见。最后由陈云同志归纳各代表意见，作总结性的讲话。他指出这次会开得很成功，从代表们所反映的意见看，工人不仅关心工资、福利和其他生活上的问题，而且关心生产建设的问题。这表示工人阶级确实具有国家主人翁的气派。只有在人民政府之下，工人们才会如此热烈地关心国家生产建设大事。这种会议以后还应当经常举行。对代表们所提要求与问题，陈亦作了解答和说明。号召全体职工大家出主意，把工厂办好，提高生产，改善生活。李立三同志也以“大家事情大家办”为主旨，要求全体工友、职员发挥智慧，大家动手，以发展新的生产事业。
