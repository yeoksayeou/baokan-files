Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, February 7th: According to a Shanghai dispatch on the 5th from the Central News Agency of the Kuomintang reactionary traitorous government: "Gan Jiehou declared that the peace delegation organized by Yan Huiqing, Zhang Shizhao, and others will fly to Beiping within two or three days. Shao Lizi and he himself will accompany them in a private capacity to assist. Gan stated that the sole mission of the delegation is to 'knock on the door,' urging the CCP to quickly appoint representatives for peace talks and decide on the time and location for the negotiations so that the government delegation can go and start peace talks," and so on. The CCP spokesperson stated: If Mr. Yan Huiqing and Mr. Zhang Shizhao of Shanghai are going to Beiping in a private capacity for sightseeing and to discuss state affairs, then General Ye Jianying, the Mayor of Beiping, is prepared to receive them. However, if, as Gan Jiehou stated, the "sole mission of the delegation is to 'knock on the door,' urging the CCP to quickly appoint representatives for peace talks and decide on the time and location for the negotiations so that the government delegation can go and start peace talks," then the CCP has already stated that preparations for peace negotiations are not yet ready, and there is nothing to talk about at the moment. We are not prepared to receive anyone from any side for the time being. As for political brokers like Gan Jiehou who are engaged in a "peace offensive," he is only qualified to sell his American-made cheap goods bearing the "peace offensive" brand in Nanjing and Shanghai. The people's Beiping does not welcome this kind of stuff. Sorry, please stop. If Gan Jiehou dares to sneak into Beiping and peddle his private goods, the people of Beiping are likely to expel him.

　　中共发言人声明
    和平谈判准备工作尚未做好
  　不接待甘介侯这类政治掮客
    【新华社陕北七日电】据国民党反动卖国政府的中央社五日上海电称：“甘介侯声明，颜惠庆、章士钊等六人组织之和平代表团，将于二三日内飞往北平。邵力子及渠两人则以私人资格随行前往策助。甘氏声明，代表团之唯一任务为从事敲门，敦促中共迅速指派和谈代表，并决定和谈之时间地点，以便政府代表团前往开始和平商谈”等情。中共发言人声明：如果上海颜惠庆章士钊诸先生是以私人资格前往北平参观，并于国事有所商谈，则北平市长叶剑英将军准备予以接待。如果照甘介侯声明“代表团之唯一任务为从事敲门，敦促中共迅速指派和谈代表，并决定和谈之时间地点，以便政府代表团前往开始和平商谈”，则中共早已声明，和平谈判的准备工作尚未做好，目前无从谈起，我们对于任何方面的人暂时均不准备接待。至于甘介侯这类从事“和平攻势”的政治掮客，他只有资格在南京上海一带出卖其“和平攻势”牌的美国制造的廉价商品，人民的北平不欢迎这类货色，对不起，请止步。如果甘价侯竟敢混入北平，贩卖私货，则北平人民很可能把他驱逐出境。
