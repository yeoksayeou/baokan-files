Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, February 14th, Electronegative News Agency, Rome, February 10th: Half-hour general strikes were held in Padua (west of Venice) and Picenza (directly south of Milan) in northern Italy on the morning of the 10th, protesting against factory owners reneging on their promise to recognize factory committees. Milan workers also decided to hold a protest general strike on the 11th. Turin workers held a general strike on the 9th. Unemployed people in Marche Province held a hunger march in Ancona (along the Adriatic coast) on the 7th, and the province held another general strike the next day. The Ancona march has achieved some results, with the government allowing 28 million lire to be used for public works to absorb the unemployed. Pisa (on the Mediterranean coast) in northern Italy also held a half-hour general strike on the morning of the 10th in support of workers threatened with layoffs. A nationwide miners' strike in support of miners in Sicily and Sardinia is scheduled to take place on the 11th. Miners in both places have been on strike for several weeks to oppose layoffs and mine dismantling. The Tuscany Provincial Trade Union Committee decided on the 9th to hold a one-hour general strike in nine states of the province to support the foundry workers of the Stulan Factory, who have occupied the factory for two months to prevent the factory owner from dismantling it. With the breakdown of negotiations between the Italian General Confederation of Labor and factory owners to amend the contract on the 5th, action by Italy's 208,000 chemical workers seems imminent.

　　意罢工运动风起云涌
  　马彻斯失业者举行饥饿游行
    【新华社陕北十四日电】电通社罗马十日讯：意大利北部巴多瓦（威尼斯西部）及配森萨（米兰正南）两地十日晨举行半小时总罢工，抗议厂主背弃承认工厂委员会的诺言，米兰工人亦决定于十一日举行抗议总罢工。都灵工人于九日举行总罢工。马彻斯省失业者于七日在安科纳（沿亚得里亚海岸）举行饥饿游行，次日，全省又举行总罢工。安科纳的游行已获部分结果，政府允许用二千八百万里拉建设公共工程，借以吸收失业者。意北之彼萨（濒地中海）十日晨也举行了半小时总罢工，声援受到停工威胁的工人。声援西西里和撒丁岛矿工的全国性矿工罢工，定于十一日举行，两处矿工为反对停工和拆矿已罢工数周。杜斯坎尼省工会委员会，九日决定在该省九州中举行一小时总罢工，以声援斯图兰加工厂的铸造工人，他们为防止厂主拆厂，已占领该厂达两月之久。在意大利总工会与厂主修改合同的谈判于五日破裂后，意大利二十万零八千化学工人的行动似乎已迫在眉睫。
