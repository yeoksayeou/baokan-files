　　Retired Soldiers Participating in Factory Work: Their Families Cannot Receive Military Dependent Benefits

Question: Regarding disabled veterans who, because their homes were in guerrilla areas, could not return home and instead went to work in public-private cooperative factories, now that their homes have been liberated, they only send letters home, and their families have not received any subsidies from them. Can their families be treated as military dependents? Please reply.
　　　　　　　　　　　
Wang Huaishu, Third District Government of Jingxing

Comrade Wang Huaishu of the Third District Government of Jingxing:

It was correct for us to help disabled veterans who could not return home because their families were in guerrilla areas, to settle down and introduce them to work. At the same time, honorary veterans should also become models for implementing government policies and decrees and should not be special. If the honorary veteran is disabled, especially of the first or second degree, and has difficulty moving, the land he has been allocated can enjoy cultivation by proxy. Those from impoverished families have priority for grain and loan provision and are exempt from service. Third-class honorary veterans perform the same service as ordinary citizens. If individuals have difficulty moving, the amount of service can be reduced or waived in whole or in part with the approval of the village assembly and the district government, and those who voluntarily perform service should be rewarded.

Honorary veterans who have been allocated land and settled locally and then go to other places to engage in industry and commerce cannot be allocated land in other districts again. Some foreign honorary veterans have already settled down and will generally no longer be sent back to their place of origin. If some honorary veterans whose families have been liberated in their original hometowns now request to return to their original hometowns, the land they have been allocated should be handed over to the local farmers' association for disposal.

Families of honorary veterans who have left military service cannot be treated as military dependents but can only be called families of labor soldiers. However, the honorary veteran himself should enjoy preferential treatment according to the regulations based on the level of disability.

### 荣退军人参加工厂工作其家属不能按军属待遇

　　荣退军人参加工厂工作其家属不能按军属待遇
    问：关于残废之退伍军人，因他家在游击区不能回家，到了公家合作工厂工作，现在他的家解放了，他只是给家转信，家中也没有得到他的补助。这样他家是否可以按军属待遇？请答复一下为盼。
  　　　　　　　　　　　井陉第三区公所王怀书井陉三区公所王怀书同志：
    关于因残废退伍之军人，过去因家在游击区不能回去，我们帮助他安家并介绍参加工作，这是对的。同时荣誉军人同志亦应成为执行政府政策法令的模范，不应特殊。如果荣军本人残废，系特等或一、二等，行动困难，其本人分得之土地可享受代耕。家境贫寒者，享有贷粮贷款之优先权，并免服勤务，三等荣军与一般公民服同等勤务。如个别身体行动困难者，可经村民大会通过，区政府批准，酌情减免一部或全部，自愿服勤务者应受奖励。
    对荣军在本地已分地安家者，到外地从事工商业，不能在外区再分土地。有些外籍荣军已经安家，原则上不再遣送回籍。如现在有些荣军他的原籍家庭解放了，自己要求回原籍者，其分得之土地，应交当地农会处理。
    脱离军籍之荣军家属，不能按军属待遇，只能称以劳军家属。但对荣军本人应依残废等级按条例上规定享受优待。
