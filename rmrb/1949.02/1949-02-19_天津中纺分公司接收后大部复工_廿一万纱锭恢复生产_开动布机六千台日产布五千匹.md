Xinhua News Agency, Tianjin, February 17th: The Tianjin Branch of the China Textile Construction Company, within twenty days of being taken over by the Tianjin Military Control Commission, has resumed production with 216,000 spindles and 6,000 looms. This is one of the remarkable achievements of the Chinese people in taking over the bureaucratic capital enterprises of the Kuomintang reactionaries. The branch originally had seven textile factories, one silk weaving factory, and one machinery factory, with more than 25,000 employees, 338,280 spindles (the previous report of 322,800 was incorrect), and 8,667 looms. From the Military Control Commission's takeover on January 16th to February 5th, five textile factories and both weaving machinery factories under the branch have resumed work successively; the sixth factory is under repair and is expected to resume work within the month; the seventh factory was unable to resume work due to the removal of equipment and bombardment by the bandit army's 26th Division, resulting in the loss of more than 50,000 spindles and more than 1,500 looms. Currently, the branch and its factories have approximately 20,000 employees. The number of spindles in operation accounts for approximately 75% of the total number of existing spindles, producing more than 95,500 pounds of cotton yarn per day (calculated at ten hours per day, the same below). The number of looms in operation accounts for approximately 85% of the total number of existing looms, producing 5,588 bolts of cotton cloth per day. The workers' work morale has significantly changed compared to the Kuomintang rule. The phenomenon of workers arriving late has decreased. Workers supplying weft yarn, who used to often fail to meet the needs of the looms, are now able to supply it on time. Some workers even voluntarily request overtime. Technicians no longer just walk around during work hours as they did in the past, but now do not leave the workshop casually, and immediately repair any machine failures. Foremen who did not participate in labor in the past are now voluntarily helping workers with odd jobs such as wiring. A worker at the silk weaving factory said, "Now that production is for the country and for ourselves, how can we not work hard?"

The main reasons why the factories were able to be taken over smoothly, resume work quickly, and initially stimulate the workers' enthusiasm for production are that the Military Control Commission correctly implemented the Chinese Communist Party's urban policy, implemented a systematic and complete takeover of the company's factories, and temporarily retained all original employees in their original positions and at their original salaries, except for resolute counter-revolutionaries, without disrupting the original technical organization and production system, and promoted various tasks through the original technical organization and production system. Regarding the employees, on the one hand, propaganda and education were carried out through meetings, large and small, classes, and blackboards; on the other hand, their lives were taken care of, such as helping employees exchange for a total of 7.35 million yuan in Renminbi at a preferential exchange rate of one to three (one yuan in Renminbi equals three yuan in pseudo-gold yuan notes) and borrowing wages twice. In the exchange of Renminbi and the distribution of flour, the factories mobilized the masses to conduct discussions and democratically elected representatives of workers and staff, which greatly improved the employees' political awareness and made things fast and well. For example, on the day before the old Lunar New Year, everyone quickly distributed more than 20,000 bags of flour and a huge loan of more than 4 million yuan in Renminbi in a day and a night of blitz. In these tasks, the responsible and hard-working style of the takeover personnel also played a significant role. It deeply moved the employees and improved everyone's work enthusiasm.

However, in the takeover process, some individual takeover personnel lacked a humble attitude to learn, pretending to know what they did not know; or were not good at utilizing the original organization, were not good at consulting with the original personnel, and interfered randomly; or did mass work when workers were on the job, thus hindering production. These shortcomings are now being corrected. In the early stage of the takeover, although the general workers generally understood that all the policies of the Chinese Communist Party represented the interests of the working class and the interests of the people, a few workers, due to insufficient understanding of the specific policies of the Chinese Communist Party and past abuse by some staff, expressed great dissatisfaction with the original position and original salary and the retention of old staff, demanding the same salary as the staff or demanding to struggle against some staff. Individual workers also showed slack production, and individual service personnel disregarded their work, mistakenly taking "turning over" as "not working." Some staff members, because they did not understand the policies of the Communist Party, were afraid of losing their jobs, afraid of struggle, and unwilling to be responsible for managing production, and some individuals deceived the takeover personnel on some specific issues. At that time, the takeover personnel used meetings, talks, and other methods to actively explain the Chinese Communist Party's employee policies and the principle of developing production, prospering the economy, taking into account both public and private interests, and benefiting both labor and capital, which initially overcame the above-mentioned erroneous ideas, greatly stabilized the employees' emotions, and began to inspire the employees' enthusiasm for production.

　　天津中纺分公司接收后大部复工
    廿一万纱锭恢复生产         
    开动布机六千台日产布五千匹
    【新华社天津十七日电】中国纺织建设公司天津分公司，在天津市军管会接收后二十天内，已有纱锭二十一万六千枚、布机六千台恢复生产。这是中国人民接管国民党反动政府官僚资本的企业后所表现的卓越成绩之一。该分公司原有七个纺织厂、一个丝织厂、一个机械厂，职工二万五千余名，纱锭三十三万八千二百八十枚（前报三十二万二千八百枚不确），布机八千六百六十七台。从上月十六日军管会接收到本月五日止，该分公司所属五个纺织厂及县织机械两厂均已先后复工；第六厂正在修理，拟月内复工；第七厂因先后遭匪军二十六师搬卸器材及炮轰，全厂损失纱锭五万余枚，布机一千五百余台，以致无法复工。现分公司及各厂共有职工约二万人。开动纱锭约占现有纱锭总数的百分之七十五，日产（每日以十小时计算，下同）棉纱九万五千五百余磅。开动布机约占现有布机总数的百分之八十五，日产棉布五千五百八十八匹。各厂职工的劳动情绪较之国民党统治时代，已有显著变化。工人上工迟到的现象已在减少。推纬纱的工人过去常常供不上织布机的需要，现在已能按时供给。有的工人更自动要求加班。技工们在工作时间再也不象过去那样转一个圈子就走了，现在则不随便离开工房，机件发生故障时，他们就立刻进行修理。过去不参加劳动的小工头，现在也自动帮着工人做接线等零碎工作。丝织厂的一位工人说：“现在生产是为了国家，也是为了自己，哪能不下劲干呢？”
    各厂所以能顺利接管迅速复工，并初步启发了职工的生产积极性，其主要原因是军管会正确执行了中国共产党的城市政策，对该公司各厂实行了有系统地完整的接管，除坚决的反革命分子外，对原有职工一律暂行原职原薪，没有打乱原有的技术组织和生产系统，并通过原有的技术组织和生产系统来推行各项工作。对于职工，一方面通过大会、小会、上课、黑板报等形式，进行宣传教育工作，另一方面又照顾了他们的生活，如按照一比三（人民币一元比伪金圆券三元）的优待比价办法，帮助职工们换得人民币共七百三十五万元和两次借支工资。而在兑换人民币与发面中各厂又发动群众进行讨论，民主选出工人与职员的代表，使职工的政治认识大为提高，并把事情办得又快又好。如在旧历年前一天，大家在一天一夜的突击中竟迅速发完了二万多袋的面粉和四百多万元人民币的巨额借支。在这些工作中，接管人员积极负责，吃苦耐劳的工作作风也起了很大的作用。它使职工们深为感动，提高了大家的工作积极性。
    但在接管工作过程中，也有个别接管人员缺乏虚心学习的态度，强不知以为知；或不善于利用原有机构，不善于和原有人员商量办事，自己乱插手；或在工人上工时去作群众工作，以至妨碍生产。这些缺点，现在注意纠正中。在接管初期，虽然一般工人都大致了解中国共产党的一切政策都是代表工人阶级利益的、代表人民利益的，但也有少数工人，由于对中国共产党的各种具体政策了解不够，加上过去受到某些职员的欺侮，故对原工原薪、留用旧有职员表示很不满意，要求和职员拿一样薪水，或者要求斗争某些职员。个别工人还表现生产松懈，个别勤务人员不顾工作，错误的把“翻身”当成“不干活”了。职员中也有因为不了解共产党的政策，怕失业，怕斗争，不愿负责管理生产，其中个别人并在某些具体问题上，欺骗接管人员。当时接管人员曾利用会议、谈话等各种方式，努力解释中国共产党的职工政策和发展生产、繁荣经济、公私兼顾、劳资两利的方针，才初步克服了上述各种错误思想，大大安定了职工情绪，开始启发了职工的生产积极性。
