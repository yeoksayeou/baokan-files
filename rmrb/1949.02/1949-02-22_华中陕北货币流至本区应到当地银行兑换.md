　　Hua Zhong and Shaanxi-Ningxia Currencies Flowing into This Area Should Be Exchanged at Local Banks
　　To the Editor:
　　I saw two types of notes at the market, and I'm confused. Please help me understand.
　　(1) One is a green 2,000 yuan note from "Hua Zhong Bank." People at the market asked if this note could be used, and I said it couldn't. The reason is that the North China government hasn't issued any announcement about it, nor do I know its exchange rate.
　　(2) The other is a 5,000 yuan note from "Shaanxi-Gansu-Ningxia" Bank, with a line below saying "Trading Company Commercial流通券." I also said it couldn't be used because there hasn't been an announcement. Was my answer correct? Can these notes be circulated in the market? If they can, what is the exchange rate? I would appreciate it if you could answer these questions.

　　Answer: The currency issued by Hua Zhong Bank is the Hua Zhong currency. The Hua Zhong currency and the Ji currency have a fixed exchange rate and are not mutually circulated. If Hua Zhong currency flows into the North China area, it should be exchanged at local banks, with a fixed exchange rate of 1 Ji currency yuan equaling 1 Hua Zhong currency yuan.
　　The Shaanxi-Gansu-Ningxia Border Region currency and the Shaanxi-Gansu-Ningxia Trading Company commercial certificate are fixed with the Ji currency, and the Shaanxi-Gansu-Ningxia border region currency and the Shaanxi Trading Company commercial certificate are not circulated in the North China area. If the Shaanxi Trading Company commercial certificate and the Shaanxi-Gansu-Ningxia Border Region currency flow into the North China area, they must be exchanged at banks, with an exchange rate of 1 Ji currency yuan equaling 20 Shaanxi Trading Company commercial certificate yuan, equaling 400 Shaanxi-Gansu-Ningxia Border Region currency yuan.

　　华中陕北货币流至本区
  　应到当地银行兑换编辑同志：
    我在集上见了两种票子，我闹不清，请编辑同志与我解答一下。
    （一）一种是：“华中银行”绿色二千元的，赶集的问我这样的票是否能花，我答复的不能花。原因就是华北政府没有布告过；也不知怎样的比值。
    （二）另一种是：“陕甘宁”银行的，下面有一弯行：“贸易公司商业流通券”伍千元的，我也答复不能花。原因也是没布告过。象这样的答复是否对？象这样的票是否能在市场流通？倘若能花怎样的比值请答复为盼。
  　　　　　　　　永年县工商局丁样孟
    答：华中银行发行的货币是华中券，华中券与冀钞规定固定比价，互不流通；如华中券流至华北区则由当地银行兑换，比价固定为冀钞一元等于华中券一元。
    陕甘宁边区票和陕甘宁贸易公司流通券，与冀钞规定固定比价，陕甘宁边区要与陕贸券不在华北区流通，如陕贸券与陕甘宁边区票流至华北区，则须经过银行兑换，比价规定为冀钞一元等于陕贸券二十元，等于陕甘宁边区票四百元。
