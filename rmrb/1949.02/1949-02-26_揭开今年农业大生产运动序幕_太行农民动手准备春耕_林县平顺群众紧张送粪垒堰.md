　　Unveiling the Prelude to This Year's Great Agricultural Production Movement
  　Taihang Peasants Begin Spring Ploughing Preparations
    Masses in Linxian and Ping順 Intensively Transport Manure and Build Embankments
    [Taihang Electric] In order to launch this year's great production movement with leadership, organization, planning, and preparation, and to achieve even an inch of growth in production, many areas of Taihang, based on the completion and conclusion of land reform, party rectification, and the increased production enthusiasm of the masses, or in conjunction with the conclusion of land reform and party rectification work, have successively begun spring ploughing preparations. The Second Administrative Office (Zuoquan) and the Fifth Prefectural Committee of the Chinese Communist Party (Anyang) both issued instructions at the beginning of this month to resolve the spring famine, provide disaster relief through production, and prepare for spring ploughing. The Second Administrative Office pointed out in its instructions: It is necessary to pay attention to seasonality, and the current focus of production should be placed on the spring ploughing preparations for agricultural production. It is necessary to organize the masses to purchase livestock, repair farm tools, prepare seeds, accumulate manure, transport manure, and repair the land. Based on specific conditions, women should be mobilized on a large scale to engage in spinning and weaving to solve the difficulties of the spring season change, and transport coal and chop firewood to prepare firewood for burning. Use the method of summarizing and reviewing history to educate cadres and the masses on the future of organized production, check and resolve the legacy problems in past mutual aid, adjust leadership, formulate regulations for members to jointly abide by, and mobilize and organize women to participate in the great production. Check and promote winter production, continue to rectify cooperatives, educate cadres to clarify supply and marketing tasks, and support production. The Fifth Prefectural Committee, based on the specific situation that there are still 400,000 disaster victims in the area, emphasized overcoming negligence and complacency in the instructions, opposed the view of solely relying on relief, and pointed out: "We must actively organize the masses to engage in production for self-relief and fight against the enemy." Now, the sub-district level has organized a Production and Famine Relief Committee, and each county will also establish a Famine Relief Committee to strengthen leadership and organize disaster victims from all aspects to solve their difficulties through production. After universal enlightenment and education, the masses in various places are actively carrying out manure accumulation and firewood chopping, and many areas have achieved great results. According to statistics from Lin (county), Hui (county), Qi (county), and An (yang) counties, Li Dafu, a demobilized soldier in Wujiajing, Lin County, who farms nine mu of land, has now accumulated 720 dan of manure, averaging 80 dan of manure per mu. The wheat fields near the village have been top-dressed twice. Qi County has cut more than 1.77 million catties of thatch in thirty-three villages. In order to eliminate locust plagues and increase production, the county also vigorously mobilized for reducing wasteland at the district and village cadre meeting last winter. Houjiao Village in Lin County has built 122 zhang of embankments. Ping順Anyang Village is also carrying out spring ploughing preparations. Currently, the people of the whole village are transporting manure in the morning, chopping firewood and doing other chores during the day. In total, the whole village has transported 27,300 dan of manure to the fields and chopped 52,200 catties of firewood. The Jie＠ Village Branch and the masses discussed the road to prosperity—organizing for production—and formulated a production plan for the whole village to increase the production of fine grains by ten catties per person this year. In addition to spinning and weaving, women must also participate in sowing. The conclusion of land reform and party rectification work in Nanbu Village, Licheng, has been fully completed. The village convened a mass meeting on the second day of the Lunar New Year to mobilize spring ploughing preparations and summarized and checked the work of previous mutual aid groups. Currently, the village is fully engaged in transporting manure. On the sixth day of the new year alone, 1,850 loads of manure were transported. The reason why these villages can start spring ploughing preparations so early is mainly due to the correct implementation of the policy of concluding land reform and party rectification. The common feature is that the leadership of the Party branch has been unprecedentedly strengthened, thus opening the prelude to a large-scale production movement with leadership, organization, and a mass base.

　　揭开今年农业大生产运动序幕
  　太行农民动手准备春耕
    林县平顺群众紧张送粪垒堰
    【太行电】为了有领导有组织有计划有准备的开展今年的大生产运动，达到生产长一寸，太行不少地区在完成结束土地改革整党及群众生产情绪提高的基础上，或结合结束土地改革与整党工作，已先后开始了春耕准备工作。二专署（左权）、中共五地委（安阳），均于本月初发出了解决春荒，生产救灾，准备春耕的指示。二专署在指示中指出：必须注意季节性，目前的生产重点应放到农业生产的春耕准备工作上，要组织群众购买牲口，修理农具准备种籽，积肥送粪修地，并应根据具体条件大量发动妇女进行纺织，以解决春季换季的困难，运煤打柴准备烧柴。在干部、群众中运用总结回顾历史的方法，进行组织起来生产前途的教育，检查解决过去互助中的遗留问题，调整领导，订立组员共同遵守的规约，发动组织妇女参加大生产。检查推动冬季生产，继续整顿合作社，教育干部明确供销任务，扶植生产。五地委，根据该区至今仍有灾民四十万人的具体情况，指示中特别强调克服轻视与麻痹的现象，反对单纯依靠救济的观点，指出：“要积极组织群众进行生产自救对敌斗争。”现分区级已组织起生产渡荒委员会，各县亦将成立渡荒委员会，加强领导，从各方面着手组织灾民生产以解决灾民困难。经过普遍启发教育，各地群众正积极的进行积肥打柴，不少地区已取得很大成绩。据林（县）、辉（县）、淇（县）、安（阳）等县统计，林县武家井荣退军人李大负种地九亩，现在已积肥七百二十担，每亩地平均要上粪八十担，靠村边的麦地已上了两次追肥。淇县三十三个村割白草一百七十七万多斤。为了消灭蝗灾增加生产，该县去冬在区村干部会上并大力动员减荒。林县后郊村已垒堰一百二十二丈。平顺安阳村亦正进行春耕准备工作。目前全村人民早上送粪，白天打柴及做其它杂活，总计全村已往地里送粪二万七千三百担，打柴五万二千二百斤。界＠村支部、群众讨论了发家致富的道路——组织起来进行生产，并订出全村今年每人增产十斤细粮的生产计划。妇女除纺织外，并须参加下种工作。黎城南堡村的结束土地改革与整党工作已全部完成，该村于旧历新年初二，即召开群众大会动员春耕准备工作，并总结检查了以往互助组的工作。目前该村全力送粪，仅初六日一天即送粪一千八百五十驮。以上这些村庄，所以能及早动手进行春耕准备，主要是由于结束土地改革及整党政策之正确贯彻，共同的特点是党的支部领导空前的加强了，因而开展了有领导有组织有群众基础的大生产运动序幕。
