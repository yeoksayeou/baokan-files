　　After two years of construction, Taihang Industrial Company has become an important force in the state-owned economy of Taihang. This company was established in early 1947, with only six machine coal mines, namely Xinzhuang, Yuming, Duli, Jiazhang, Dazhong, and Qicun, as well as a manual coal kiln, and a Huafeng Iron Factory. However, due to the imperfect equipment of these factories and mines, the output was small and could not be self-sufficient, and they constantly needed money from the company. Over the past two years, through the efforts of all cadres and workers, not only have the original factories and mines been greatly improved, but also some new factories have been established. The current assets are quite considerable. In terms of coal industry: According to statistics from five mines in the past ten months, the total coal production was more than 130,000 tons, and the output has been gradually increasing. For example, the output per worker (twelve hours) in Jiazhang Mine has increased from the lowest point of 0.8 tons to the current 1.3 tons. The output of Qicun Mine in January last year was more than 290 tons, which increased to more than 1,700 tons in May. Due to the increase in output, the profit also increased. According to the calculation of the five mines, the profit in December last year accounted for 40.29%. The profit was then used for the construction of reproduction. For example, the old well of Dazhong Coal Mine had a small output, so two new wells were opened, and the current daily output has increased from an average of 60 tons per day in June last year to more than 200 tons. In the machine manufacturing industry, Huafeng Iron Factory has also made great progress. The factory was originally a small tool manufacturing factory, which could only manufacture some simple tools. Now it has become the largest machine manufacturing factory in Taihang. From small screws to large high-speed cars, gas engines, steam engines, water pumps and other various sizes of machines can be manufactured. The manufacturing machines and tools used in the factory, from six-foot to twenty-four-foot long vertical, horizontal, and flat washing beds, planers, power machines, etc., are mostly self-made. It now has more than 300 skilled technical workers. Using the tools they made with their own hands, they produced a large number of machines. From September to November last year, it completed two 17-inch shaping machines, one flat washing bed, and one 25-horsepower engine. In addition, large machines such as high-speed cars, water pumps, and 50-horsepower winding engines are also being completed. The product quality is very good. The company also operates an iron smelting plant. During the Anti-Japanese War, the Shangdang iron industry was almost completely destroyed by the Japanese and puppets. After the victory, gray pig iron became a very difficult problem for Taihang's military and civilian needs. Although all parties were willing to develop locally at that time, they could not start due to the difficulty of technical personnel. Later, the company discovered that the iron used in the plow furnaces in Jincheng was gray pig iron, and immediately sent people to Jincheng to study and learn. In the spring of last year, it officially set up a furnace to smelt iron. After research and transformation, the quality was greatly improved. In November last year, the first-class gray pig iron increased by 20% compared with June. There are now 14 large and small furnaces, and the output increased from 10,000 jin in January last year to more than 30,000 jin in November. The workers also improved the process to reduce costs. In terms of light industry, the Yihua Textile Factory, which was built last year, started construction on the factory site in April. In just half a year, it was installed and put into operation, and officially started production in October. In the construction of the factory, all employees showed a high degree of enthusiasm and creativity, and overcame all difficulties. When installing the steel spinning machine, the roller had many uneven holes due to improper transportation and storage, and it was rusty, and many parts were lost. However, the mechanical workers created an automatic tool feed, removed the rust on the roller, flattened it, and matched many parts, which made the factory start four months earlier. There are now nine spinning machines and more than 240 workers and apprentices of various kinds. Except for one that is regularly scrubbed, the remaining eight are operating in two shifts day and night. In November and December, a total of 10,080 bundles of 20-count yarn were produced (10.5 pounds per bundle). Recently, due to precise calculation, the spindle speed is 400 revolutions faster than before when the main shaft rope is tightened at any time, so that the daily output is increased by 15 pounds compared with the past when the rope was tightened at noon. Due to the improvement of technology and attention to the selection of raw materials, the finished product is very white and the twist is very uniform, so the sales are wide. Cotton weaving and knitting factories in Nangong, Xingtai and other places that purchase yarn from the factory say: Lihua's yarn is the best compared with Shimen, Jinan, and Jixian yarn. Every pound of yarn produced can earn one pound of pure cotton. The factory also has a weaving factory with more than 200 looms, producing more than ten bolts of foreign cloth per day. In order to develop future production in an organized and planned manner, to achieve mutual support and unified use of funds, raw materials, and machines, the company implemented unified management in November last year. In order to strengthen technical guidance to various factories and mines, the company itself has added a technical section to the organization, equipped with experienced and knowledgeable engineers of various types. According to the general spirit of the North China Industrial and Commercial Conference, in October last year, meetings of various managers, accountants, and technical personnel were held separately to solve various major issues such as economic accounting, cost calculation, operation and management, engineering construction, technical guidance, labor organization, and wage policies in future development, laying the foundation for the smooth development of industry in the future.

　　经过两年建设的太行实业公司
    太行分社
    太行实业公司经过两年建设、已成为太行国营经济中一个重要的力量。该公司于一九四七年初成立，当时只有辛庄、裕明、都里、贾掌、大众、祁村等六座机器煤矿及一手工煤窑，和一个华丰铁工厂。但因这些厂矿设备均不完善，产量不大，不能自足，还不断向公司要钱。二年来经过全体干部与职工的努力，不但使原来的厂矿大为改善，且新设了一些工厂。现在的家当，已相当可观。在煤业方面：五个矿去年十个月统计，共产煤十三万余吨，产量都是逐渐增加，如贾掌矿每一个工（十二小时）产量已由最低时的点八吨增至现在的一吨三。祁村矿去年一月份产量是二百九十余吨，五月份即增至一千七百余吨。由于产量增加，营利也就增加，五个矿计算，去年十二月营利占百分之四十点二九，营利以后又用于再生产的建设，如大众煤矿旧井产量较小，便新开了两眼新井，现每日产量即由去年六月每日平均六十吨增至二百余吨。在机器制造业上，华丰铁工厂也有很大发展。该厂原为小型工具制造厂，只可制造些简单工具，现在已成为太行最大的机器制造厂。小至螺丝钉，大至高车、煤气、蒸气引擎机、水泵等各种大小机器均可制造。厂内所用之制造机器的工具，从六英尺至两丈四英尺长的立、平、卧等各种洗床、刨床、动力机等大部为自制，现拥有各种熟练技术工人三百余人。利用自己亲手造出的工具，生产了大量的机器。从去年九月到十一月，完成了十七英寸牛头刨二部，平洗床一部，二十五马力引擎一部等，此外高车、水泵、及卷机五十马力引擎等庞大机器也正在完成中。产品质量均很好，该公司也还经营有一个炼铁厂，抗日期间因上党铁业被日伪摧残殆尽，胜利后灰生铁成了太行军需民用极感困难的问题。当时各方虽愿就地发展，但因技术人员困难，也无法开创。后来公司发现晋城犁头炉所用之铁系灰生铁，随即派人前往晋城研究学习，去年春正式设炉炼铁，经过研究改造，质量大大提高，去年十一月份头等灰生铁较六月份增加百分之二十，现共有大小炉十四个，产量由去年一月份的一万斤增至十一月份的三万余斤。又经过工人改进使成本减低。在轻工业方面，于去年开建的益华纺织厂，从四月开始修建厂址，仅半年工夫，即接装完毕，于十月正式开工生产。在建厂中，全体职工发挥了高度的积极性与创造性，克服了一切困难。按装钢纱机时，滚筒因运输、保管不慎、撞下了很多高低不平的洞子，并且生了锈，零件也丢了不少。但机工同志们创造了自动走刀，去了滚筒上的锈，又加以削平，并配了不少零件，使厂开工提前了四个月。现有纺纱机九部，各种工人学徒二百四十余人。除一部经常擦洗外，其余八部日夜两班开动，十一、十二两月份共出二十支洋纱一万零八十捆（每捆十磅半）。最近由于精确计算，随时将天轴大绳缩紧后，锭子速度较前转快四百转，使每日产量较过去在中午停车紧绳时增加十五磅。由于技术的改进，注意原料的选择，成品十分白净，捻度也很均匀，因而销路也广，购用该厂洋纱的南宫、邢台等地的棉织、针织厂说：利华的纱和石门、济南、汲县纱比较是头一份。每出纱一磅，可赚纯棉花一磅。该厂并附设了一个织布厂，有织机二百余台，日产洋布十余匹。公司方面为了有组织、有计划的发展今后生产，做到资金、原料、机器的相互支援及统一使用力量，又于去年十一月实行了统一经营。公司本身为加强对各厂矿技术指导，在机构上又增添了技术科，配备了有经验、有知识的各种工程师、又根据华北工商会议的总精神，于去年十月间分别召开了各经理、会计、技术人员等会议，解决今后发展中的经济核算、成本计算、经营管理、工程建设、技术指导、劳力组织、工资政策等各种重大问题，打下了今后顺利发展工业的基础。
