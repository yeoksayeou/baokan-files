　　The Donghui Village branch in Yushe County, after party rectification and democratic education both inside and outside the party, has seen the vast majority of party members' ideology and work style transformed. The masses have developed a sense of ownership, and the entire village is united in actively carrying out democratic construction. At the branch's summing-up meeting, twelve party members, including Zhou Jinwei and Wang Erhuo, were commended. Everyone felt that this party rectification had gone from being afraid of rectification to being willing to be rectified, from being a "sick person" to a good person, and from being not very supported by the masses to being actively supported. Some of the masses said: "In the future, we must act in accordance with the policies of the higher authorities, not do things blindly. Party members must unite themselves, often consult with the masses when handling affairs, and if anyone has a mistake, we must promptly point it out and correct it. Our village will definitely become a model production village." After the summing-up, they proceeded to discuss whether the branch's democratic life in the past was sufficient and whether actions were unified, and how to make fewer or no mistakes in the future. After discussion, they reviewed the serious state of disorganization and lack of discipline that had existed in the branch in the past, where they neither discussed and studied nor listened to instructions from higher authorities, but instead blindly and recklessly did things, each going their own way, resulting in losses in work. In the future, they must adhere to the party's organizational principle of democratic centralism and give full play to the spirit of collective leadership and everyone's responsibility, in order to achieve unity of the branch and unity of thought and action. To this end, it was unanimously decided that in the future, various systems such as criticism and learning within the party, inspection and reporting of work, and regular meetings of groups and the entire branch should be established and improved. And through democratic procedures, a new branch committee was elected. After the establishment of the new branch committee, they first discussed the requests of nine masses to join the party, so that they could be formally accepted as party members after approval from higher authorities. Next, they launched a democratic movement throughout the village to elect the village government. The branch led the masses in reviewing the situation in the past where they did not want to attend meetings, did not work actively, and did not seriously help correct the mistakes of cadres. Some of the masses reviewed the incorrectness of their previous unwillingness to perform corvée labor, participate in the war, pay burdens, and all forms of extreme democracy. Because of this guidance, the masses checked themselves with a sense of ownership, which further promoted their sense of ownership. On the other hand, the cadres also reviewed their past insufficient understanding of democracy and their bad work style of violating democratic principles, such as taking over everything and resorting to coercion and commandism, which must be corrected in the future. On the basis of improving the thinking of the masses and cadres, the importance of the People's Representative Conference and its powers were explained. Then, an election committee was established to lead the masses in registering citizens, dividing electoral districts, and deliberating on candidate lists. Because the masses' awareness of ownership had increased, they behaved very seriously when reviewing citizens, and many farmers automatically held family meetings before the election to discuss who to vote for. This showed an unprecedented atmosphere of democratic consciousness among the masses. As a result, twenty-five representatives were elected, the chairman and vice-chairman of the village government were nominated, and seven village government committee members were elected for civil affairs, education, finance and grain, logistics, and public security. Under the collective leadership and division of labor, they carried out various village construction tasks throughout the village. The representative conference also planned to continue discussing the organization of mutual aid and the formulation of a three-year production and construction plan.

　　榆社东汇村支部经过整党
  　积极领导村政建设
    【太行电】榆社东汇村支部经过整党及党内外的民主教育，绝大部分党员的思想与作风均得到改造，群众有了主人翁的自觉，全村团结一致积极进行民主建设。支部总结大会上，有周金维、王二货等十二个党员受到表扬。大家都感到这次整党是由怕整到愿整，由“病人”到好人，由群众不很拥护到积极拥护了。群众有的说：“今后要照上级政策办事，不要瞎干，党员要自己团结，时常和群众商量办事，谁有错误咱要随时提出改正，咱村一定能闹成个生产模范村。”总结完后，接着讨论过去支部民主生活够不够及行动统一不统一，今后怎样就可以少犯错误或不犯错误等问题。经过讨论，检讨出以前支部严重的存在着既不讨论研究，又不听上级指示，盲干瞎干、各来一套的无组织无纪律状态，以致造成工作上的损失。今后必须依据党的民主集中制的组织原则，发挥集体领导与大家负责的精神，以求支部团结与思想行动的统一。为此一致决议今后要建立与健全党内的批评与学习、工作的检查与报告、小组与全支部的定期会议等各种制度。并经过民主手续，选举出了新支部委员会。新的支委会建立后，先讨论了九个群众的入党要求，以便经上级批准后正式接收为党员。次即发动全村群众进行了选举村政府的民主运动。支部领导群众检讨了以前不想开会，不积极工作，对干部的错误不认真帮助改正等情形，有的群众检讨了以前不想支差、参战、出负担以及一切极端民主的不对。由于这样诱导群众以主人翁的态度检查了自己，所以更加促进了群众主人翁的自觉。另方面干部也检讨了以前对民主认识不足，包办代替与强迫命令等违犯民主原则的不良作风，今后必须改正。在群众和干部思想提高的基础上，又讲解了人民代表会的重要及其职权。随即成立选举委员会，领导群众进行登记公民、划分选区，以及酝酿候选名单等工作。由于群众对主人翁的自觉提高，在审查公民时表现得很认真，也有不少农民在选举前自动开家庭会讨论选谁好。表现了群众空前的民主自觉的气氛。结果选出二十五名代表，推出了村政府的正副主席，并选举了民政、教育、财粮、后勤、治安等各个村政委员七人，在集体领导、分工负责的方式下，进行全村各种村政建设工作。代表会并计划继续讨论组织互助与制定三年生产建设计划。
