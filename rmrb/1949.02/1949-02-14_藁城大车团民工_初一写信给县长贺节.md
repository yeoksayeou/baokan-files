Gucheng Cart Brigade Laborers
　　Write a New Year's Letter to the County Head
　　On the first day of the Lunar New Year, at the fifth watch, the laborers of the Second Squad of the First Platoon of the Seventh Company of the Gucheng Cart Brigade in Jiazhai were gathered around the table making dumplings. Wang Qingwen's small rolling pin was really fast, supplying the whole squad, a big basin of pork filling, half of it disappeared in a little while, and the dumplings were being served out one after another. They were making them while talking, each saying a word, and bursts of laughter traveled far.
　　Squad leader Wang Gou said: "It's no use for us to chat idly, let's write a New Year's letter to the platoon leader and the county committee!" Everyone agreed when he said this, but Wang Chenhai said: "We are illiterate, what can we write?" Wang Gou said: "Write whatever we have, is it okay to have democracy?" Everyone said: "Good, let our squad leader write it for us!" After they found paper and pen, they started to work, each saying what they wanted to say.
　　Wang Chenhai said: "We've been out for more than forty days, let's first tell them: 'Sailing in the coldest days, big boats several yards long, like a flock of ducks sending military grain to Tianjin...'" As soon as he said this, everyone clamored. Yang Gao said: "On the road from Xinzhen to Langfang, the cart convoys, ox carts, and donkey carts, going and coming, were so lively! There were also five-horse rubber-tired carts of the Northeast Liberation Army."
　　Ling Xue said: "In Langfang, I saw trains and armored vehicles with cannons and machine guns on top." At this point, Wang Gou, the squad leader who was acting as the scribe, quickly interjected: "Are you pulling it too far?"
　　Xiao Dian then said: "Right, we couldn't get food on the road, and we only ate one meal a day, but we were all fine at that time, and we had great energy going to Beijing."
　　"It snowed when we got to Xiaomen Village," another also chimed in, "We slept and rested on the street, but we didn't complain!..." Wang Chenhai said: "We have to mention the old man Wang Fuyou, while we young people were sleeping, he fed the livestock for our whole squad. Our regimental commander is also good, my shoes were unwearable, and the regimental commander gave me a newly bought pair of shoes and told me to wear them."
　　Geng Shen said: "I think we should also write about our New Year, we ate three meals of dumplings during the New Year, all with cabbage and pork filling, and we also ate a meat dish." Wang Zhen said: "On New Year's Eve, our whole squad had entertainment, drinking and singing, Yang Gao played a self-made *huqin*, and Yang Shouren sang 'Borrowing the East Wind'. We also beat drums and performed *yangge*, and the happy people smiled with their mouths wide open."

　　藁城大车团民工
  　初一写信给县长贺节
    大年初一五更里，藁城大车团七连一排二班在家寨的民工，围着桌子捏饺子，王庆文的小赶饼真是快，供全班的人捏，一大盆猪肉馅，一会就下去了一半，饺子一帘帘的往外端。他们一面捏一面说，你一言他一语，一阵一阵的笑声传得很远。
    班长王狗说：“咱们扯东道西没有用，咱们给班长县委写拜年信吧！”这一说，大家都赞成，可是王辰海说：“咱们又不识字可写什么呢？”王狗说：“有什么写什么，实行民主行不？”大家都说：“好，咱班长给代笔吧！”他们找来了纸笔之后就动起手来，一个个的都说出自己要说的话。
    王辰海说：“咱们出来了四十多天，咱们先给他们说：数九天里走船，好几丈长的大船，象一群鸭子往天津送军粮……”这一说，大家都嚷嚷起来了。杨高说：“咱们从新镇到廊坊的大道上，八路并进的大车队、牛车、驴车、去的、回来的、那多热闹？还有东北解放军五个马拉的胶皮车。”
    灵穴说：“我在廊坊见了火车、铁甲车，上边架着大炮和机枪。”说到这里，代笔的班长王狗连忙插嘴说：“拉的太远咧？”
    小点就说：“对，在道上领不到粮食，一天吃一顿饭，可是咱们那时候都挺好，下北京去的劲大。”
    “到小门村下了雪”，另一个也答腔说：“咱们当街睡觉休息，可是都没叫过苦！……”王辰海说：“这得说上人家老头王福有，咱们年轻的睡了觉，人家给咱全班喂牲口。咱团长也好，我那鞋穿不的了，团长给了我一对新买的鞋叫我穿。”
    更深说：“我看咱过年也写写吧，过年吃了三顿饺子，都是白菜猪肉馅，还吃了一顿肉菜。”王珍说：“三十晚上咱全班闹娱乐，一边喝酒一边唱，杨高拉自造胡胡，杨守仁唱‘借东风’。又打鼓扭秧歌，欢喜的人们张着大嘴笑。”
