To the Editor:

Regarding the suggestion made by Comrade Yao Jingmin of the Wuqiang County Saltpeter Bureau, published in the "Criticism and Suggestions" column on January 29th, that the General Bureau should standardize purchase prices, we have conducted a preliminary investigation and offer the following response:

The saltpeter prices in each region are determined by the General Bureau in a unified manner. Due to varying production conditions in different areas, saltpeter prices cannot be completely consistent. For example, prices are higher in alkaline soil areas than in plain areas. Currently, Central Hebei and Southern Hebei have basically the same production conditions, so they adopt the same price. According to the General Bureau's new saltpeter price regulations issued in October, the highest price for first-grade saltpeter in both regions is five jin of rice, to be specifically controlled and implemented by the local district bureaus.

Secondly, in Southern Hebei after last year's wheat harvest, due to the scarcity of rice and lower wheat prices, the Administrative Office allocated a portion of wheat to be distributed to saltpeter workers. At that time, the price difference between rice and wheat was not significant. The General Bureau does not yet have detailed information on subsequent changes in the rice-to-wheat price ratio. We have now instructed Southern Hebei to report the detailed process of distributing wheat. We are also investigating price conditions in Central Hebei in order to appropriately adjust purchasing work in the border areas between the two regions. We will provide a more detailed response after the matter has been clarified.

Respectfully yours,

The Saltpeter and Sulfur General Bureau of the North China People's Government

### 关于冀南冀中两区收硝价格的说明

专栏：检查与答复

　　关于冀南冀中两区收硝价格的说明编辑同志：
    一月二十九日批评与建议栏刊载了武强县火硝局姚敬民同志建议总局应统一收购价格，经初步检查敬复如下：
    各区硝价是经过总局统一规定的，由于各地生产条件不同，为了保证生产利润，硝价不能完全一致。如用灰区高于平原区。现冀中、冀南因为生产条件基本相同，故采取同一价格。按照总局十月新硝价规定，两区一等硝最高为五斤米，由各区局具体掌握执行。
    其次冀南去年麦收后，因米少而麦价较低，曾由行署拨给一部分麦子发给硝工。当时米麦价相差不大，以后米麦价比额变化，总局尚不详细。现已指示冀南，报告发麦子的详细经过。我们并调查冀中物价情况以便适当的调整两区间交界区收购工作。待问题查明后再作详细答复。此致敬礼
