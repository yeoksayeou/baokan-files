　　Reading the Newspaper Dictionary
　　*Mainichi Shimbun*
　　——A Japanese newspaper. It was formed in 1943 by the merger of the Tokyo "Nichinichi Shimbun" and the Osaka "Mainichi Shimbun" and is published in Tokyo. The newspaper's behind-the-scenes bosses are Japanese big capitalists, representing the interests of the big bourgeoisie, and is conservative, even more reactionary than the reactionary Democratic Liberal Party's organ, the "Asahi Shimbun."
　　Bureaucratic Capital
　　——Is a special product of Chinese semi-feudal and semi-colonial society. The four families of Chiang, Soong, Kung, and Chen, during their twenty years in power, used their political privileges to forcibly concentrate a huge capital of one million to two million US dollars, monopolizing the economic lifeline of the country. This monopoly capital, in addition to being combined with the state power, is also closely combined with foreign imperialism and the domestic landlord class and old-style rich peasants. This type of capital is called bureaucratic capital. This capital not only plunders workers, peasants, and all independent laborers, but also harms national capitalists. Because this capital has feudal and comprador characteristics, it has become the largest and most cruel force destroying the development of productive forces in modern Chinese society, and its reaction and backwardness lie in this.
　　Italian Socialist Party
　　——Is now the second largest party in Italy. According to the 1948 statistics, the number of party members has reached more than 900,000. At the beginning of the 20th century, the party was quite active, and after the First World War, it became even more active. However, due to the lack of capable and strong leadership, it committed right-leaning opportunism and failed to gain power. Fascist leader Mussolini was originally a member of the party, but was expelled from the party in 1914. After Mussolini gained power in 1922, the party went through arduous struggles. After the collapse of Mussolini's fascist regime, the party formed a united front with the Communist Party and corrected its past erroneous policies. The party chairman, Nenni, made a review at the party's representative meeting in 1946: "The events of the past 25 years have proved that the struggle between the Communist and Socialist parties only benefits the enemies of democracy. Therefore, overcoming class divisions is the basic task of members of the Communist and Socialist parties." At the party's 26th representative meeting in January 1948, it was decided to unite with the Communist Party in the general election in April of the same year to fight against the reactionary Italian government. The current secretary-general of the party is Basso, the deputy secretary is Lussu, and the chairman is still Nenni. It is noted that Nenni was elected as the executive member of the party's executive committee in January 1948, and continued to serve as the leader of the party's organ, Avanti! On July 12 of the same year, the party's parliamentary group, disregarding the obstruction of the party's executive committee composed of purely "centrist" representatives, overwhelmingly elected Nenni, the leader of the party's left wing, as chairman.

　　读报辞典
    每日新闻
    ——日本的报纸。在一九四三年，由东京的“日日新闻”和大阪的“每日新闻”合并而成，在东京出版。该报后台老板是日本的大资本家，是代表大资产阶级利益的，倾向保守，比反动的民主自由党的机关报“朝日新闻”还要反动。
    官僚资本
    ——是中国半封建半殖民地社会的特殊产物。蒋、宋、孔、陈四大家族在他们当权的二十年中，利用他们的政治特权，以强制的方法，集中了一百万万到二百万万美元的巨大资本，垄断着全国的经济命脉，这个垄断资本除与国家政权结合外，还和外国帝国主义及本国的地主阶级及旧式富农，也密切地结合着，这种性质的资本就叫做官僚资本。这个资本不但掠夺工人、农民及一切独立劳动者，还损害民族资本家。这种资本因为有封建性与买办性，所以成为破坏近代中国社会生产力发展的最大与最残酷的力量，它的反动、落后也就在此。
    意大利社会党
    ——是现在意大利的第二大党，据一九四八年的统计，党员已达九十万以上。在二十世纪初，该党已相当活跃，第一次世界大战后，更为积极，但因无干练坚强的领导，曾犯了右倾机会主义，未能获得政权，法西斯头子莫索里尼，原为该党分子，于一九一四年被开除党籍，一九二二年，莫索里尼获得政权后，该党历尽了艰苦的斗争，及至莫索里尼的法西斯政权崩溃后，该党与共产党结成了统一战线，并纠正了过去错误的政策，该党主席南尼在一九四六年党的代表大会上曾做检讨：“最近廿五年来的事变，证明了共、社两党的斗争，只有利于民主的敌人，因此克服阶级的分裂，是共、社两党党员的基本任务”。在一九四八年一月，该党的第二十六届代表大会上，就决定了于同年四月大选中，与共产党团结一致，向意大利的反动政府斗争。现在该党的总书记为巴索，副书记为陆赛图，主席仍为南尼。按南尼在一九四八年一月被选为该党执政委员会的执行委员，并连任该党机关报——前进报的指导者。于同年七月十二日，该党议会党团，不顾该党清一色的“中间派”代表组成的执委会之阻挠，以压倒多数仍推选该党左翼领袖南尼为主席。
