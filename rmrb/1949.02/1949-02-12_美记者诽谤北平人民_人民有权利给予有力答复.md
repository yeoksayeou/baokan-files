Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 8th. Are the reports issued by American journalists after the liberation of Beiping facts or slander? The people of Beiping have the most right to answer this question. Keon of the United Press reported on the 1st: "Beiping calmly and curiously received the conquerors. Various student and worker groups lined the streets, each team carrying large colored flags, hoarsely shouting slogans, but this was not a reflection of the general public sentiment. They expressed the same reserved attitude that was supposedly used to greet six conquerors in the past forty years." Musaa of the Associated Press reported on the 3rd: "Today, Beiping gave its communist conquerors a lively welcome, something only this frequently conquered city can do. The communists showed the crowded thousands of people one or two things to see – miles of captured American-made vehicles of all kinds. Long lines of citizens shouted themselves hoarse in this enthusiastic welcoming parade – just as they welcomed the Japanese when the Japanese occupied Beiping, welcomed the Americans when the Americans returned (!?), welcomed the Chinese Kuomintang when they returned, and welcomed the Mongols and Tatars hundreds of years ago. Beiping has a well-deserved reputation for welcoming its conquerors." How will the free people of Beiping receive these American "conquerors" who "returned" to treat Beiping as a colony? Will they "express a reserved attitude"? Or will they "give a lively welcome"? Let's wait and see.

　　美记者诽谤北平人民
  　人民有权利给予有力答复
    【新华社陕北八日电】美国记者们在北平解放后发出的报导究竟是事实还是诽谤呢？北平的人民最有权利来答复这个问题。合众社的基昂在一日报导说：“北平平静地好奇地接待征服者。各种学生和工人团体排列在街道上，各小队都打着大幅彩色旗帜，嘶哑地喊着口号，但这并不是一般人民情绪的反映。他们表示了据说过去四十年中用以迎接六次征服者的同样的保留态度。”美联社的穆萨在三日报道说：“今日北平给它的共产党征服者一个热闹的欢迎，这只有这个经常被征服的城市才能够做到。共产党向拥挤着的成千成万的人显出一两件东西看看——长达数哩的缴获来的美国造的各种车辆。长列的市民在这个热烈的欢迎游行中把嗓子都喊哑了——正如当日本人占领北平他们欢迎日本人，当美国人回来（！？）他们欢迎美国人，当中国国民党人回来他们欢迎国民党人，以及数百年前欢迎蒙古人与鞑靼人一样。北平很欢迎它的征服者方面是素享盛名的。”北平的自由人民将怎样来接待这些以北平为殖民地而“回来”的美国“征服者”呢？是“表示保留态度”吗？还是“给一个热闹的欢迎”呢？让我们等着看吧。
