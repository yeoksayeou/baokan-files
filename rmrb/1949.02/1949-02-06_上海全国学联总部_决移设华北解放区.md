　　Shanghai National Student Federation Headquarters
    Decides to Move to North China Liberated Area
    [Xinhua News Agency, North China, 4th] The headquarters of the All-China Students' Federation, originally located in Shanghai, has decided to move its headquarters to the North China Liberated Area in order to jointly prepare for the convening of the All-China Student Representative Conference with the student federations of the liberated areas. The heads of the association, Chen Zhenzhong, Shi Jitao, Zhou Shouchang, Huang Hezheng, Zhang Yufen, etc., arrived in Shijiazhuang one after another on the 15th of last month. Other staff will also arrive successively. They told reporters that the vast majority of students in the Kuomintang-controlled areas support the statement made by Chairman Mao Zedong of the Chinese Communist Party on January 14. They are extremely willing to unite with students in the liberated areas to fight to the end to eliminate all reactionary forces and complete the new democratic revolution together. The All-China Students' Federation was established in Shanghai on June 19, 1947, and has been the leading body of the student movement in the Kuomintang-controlled areas for years. Later, because the Kuomintang reactionary government ordered it to "disband," it was forced to go underground. After the headquarters of the association moved to the liberated area, it still has an office in Shanghai, responsible for promoting student work in the Kuomintang-controlled areas.

　　上海全国学联总部
    决移设华北解放区
    【新华社华北四日电】原设上海的中国学生联合会总部，为与各解放区学生联合会共同筹备召开中华全国学生代表大会起见，决将总部移设华北解放区。该会负责人陈震中、史继陶、周寿昌、黄鹤祯、张毓芬等，已于上月十五日先后到达石家庄。其他工作人员亦将陆续到达。他们向记者表示：国民党统治区的绝大多数学生，都拥护中国共产党主席毛泽东先生一月十四日的声明。他们极愿与解放区的学生团结一致，为消灭一切反动势力，完成新民主主义革命共同奋斗到底。中国学生联合会是在一九四七年六月十九日在上海成立，为年来国民党统治区学生运动的领导机关。后来因为国民党反动政府勒令“解散”，遂被迫转入地下。该会总部移来解放区后，仍在上海设有办事处，负责推进国民党统治区的学生工作。
