  　Jointly Promulgated
    Measures for Handling Enemy Soldiers and Vagrants
    [Our Newspaper] In order to stipulate measures for handling enemy soldiers and vagrants, the North China People's Government and the North China Military Region issued a joint instruction on January 28th to governments at and above the county level, all departments and directly affiliated organs of the North China Government, all secondary military regions, the Shijiazhuang Garrison Command, the Yangquan Logistics Command, the Baoding Military Control Commission, and the Beijing, Tianjin, and Zhangjiakou Military Control Commissions, stating in brief:
    The North China Kuomintang bandit army is collapsing entirely. In addition to the surrendered soldiers and captured soldiers being handled uniformly by the political organs above the brigade level at the front, there are still soldiers and vagrants scattered in various places. It is urgent to have unified handling measures. The specific regulations are as follows: 1. Governments at all levels along the front lines and non-regular troops should immediately set up posts for inspection. If enemy soldiers and vagrants or surrendered soldiers and captured soldiers are encountered, they must not be handled without authorization. They should be handed over to the nearest regular troops for unified handling. 2. If governments at all levels and non-regular troops encounter prisoners and surrendered soldiers who have been processed by the political organs above the brigade level of regular troops and have special official documents, they should be released immediately and no additional travel expenses should be subsidized. 3. If inland governments at all levels encounter enemy soldiers and vagrants passing through without official documents issued by the political organs above the brigade level of the army, in addition to strict inspection to prevent enemy officers and special agents from disguising and absconding, they should be allowed to return home freely and be given propaganda and education to make them abide by the law and engage in production, but no other documents or travel expenses should be issued. 4. Fearing that those who are far from home will have no documents or travel expenses, which will affect social order, it is specially designated that the Baoding Military Control Commission, the Shijiazhuang Garrison Command, the Yangquan Logistics Command, and the secondary military regions should conduct strict reviews of such personnel and reissue documents and travel expenses, which should be reported to the General Military Region Supply Department for reimbursement. In order to prevent double claiming and fraudulent claiming, the travel expenses can be issued by the military regions in continuous succession. For the convenience of work, the secondary military regions can entrust designated county governments in important traffic routes to handle the matter, and the county government will directly report to the military region for reimbursement. The North China Military Region should be informed of which county is entrusted and reported to the North China People's Government for the record. 5. Appropriate education should be given to soldiers and vagrants, mainly lenient treatment education and current affairs education. Those returning to the Kuomintang rulers should be given simple tasks of disintegrating the enemy army and preparing to welcome our army; those returning to the liberated areas should be given law-abiding production education. The education time should generally not exceed five days, and the expenses should also be reported to the General Military Region Supply Department for reimbursement. 6. After soldiers and vagrants of local origin return home, regardless of whether they have documents or not, they should be ordered to register with the district government and be mobilized and organized to participate in production.
