　　The Ox Has Arrived!
　　In the east of Lianshui City, Jiangsu Province, there is a village. In that village, there is a family surnamed Jin, and they have a son named Jin Quan. After land reform, Jin Quan's family was allocated more than twenty mu of land. Last year, the crops had a good harvest, and the family had a surplus.
　　Speaking of Jin Quan's family, they hadn't bought an ox for three generations. From Jin Quan's grandfather, to Jin Quan's father, to Jin Quan himself, they always borrowed oxen from others when they needed them. Now that they have land and a surplus, the whole family discussed and decided to buy an ox. Jin Quan's father said, "I'm over seventy years old, and I've never bought an ox in my life. Now that we can buy one, just looking at it will make me happy!" After everyone calculated, the surplus money was enough to buy an ox, so they decided to let Jin Quan go buy it. Jin Quan is only twenty, and although his family has never had an ox, he has worked as a hired laborer for others since he was a child and is used to handling oxen. Jin Quan's father said, "It's good for you to go, I'm afraid I can't walk long distances."
　　That day, Jin Quan took the money and prepared to go to town. His wife said to him, "Are you leaving already?" Jin Quan said, "If I'm not leaving, what else?" His wife handed him a piece of red silk. Jin Quan recognized it as the silk his wife had used to wrap flowers when she got married. He didn't understand and asked her, "What's this for?" His wife smiled and said, "You have to wear red when you buy an ox, don't you even know that!" Jin Quan smiled. He thought, even if he wasn't superstitious, it was good to have good luck, so he took it and went to town.
　　In the eyes of the emancipated peasants in the liberated areas, buying an ox is a major event and a joyous occasion. Jin Quan's father, who was over seventy years old and had never raised an ox, kept thinking after Jin Quan left, "For more than seventy years, I haven't taken care of an ox. I never thought we'd have one now. An ox is a cornucopia. What is a treasure to farmers? An ox is a treasure! Where did these days come from? Late in life, I'm having good luck! Thanks to Chairman Mao for conquering the country and planning for the poor." As he thought, he felt happy and contented, so he leaned on his crutch and went to stroll around his neighbors' homes, telling everyone he met, "My family is buying an ox today!" He kept looking up at the sun, wondering if it was time for Jin Quan to return. It was almost noon, and he thought Jin Quan should be back, but he still hadn't returned. Jin Quan's father kept muttering, "Why isn't he back yet? Why isn't he back yet?" He said to his granddaughter-in-law, "You don't know the hardship of not having an ox! Begging brothers and sisters is a small matter, but you have to wait for others to plow before you can plow. If you catch the right time, you can't catch the right land. Now that we have an ox, life in the fields will be much easier." He waited until after lunch, but the ox still hadn't arrived. Jin Quan's father was a little tired, so he lay down to rest. As soon as he lay down, Jin Quan came back, and his granddaughter-in-law shouted at the door, "Dad! The ox has arrived!" Jin Quan's father was wide awake in an instant. He quickly got up from the bed and walked to the door. He saw Jin Quan leading a healthy yellow ox from the threshing ground. Red silk was wrapped around the ox's horns, shining brightly. He joyfully greeted them, and many neighbors also crowded around.
　　The ox was led to the door and tied up. Upon closer inspection, its four hooves were firmly planted, and it was plump and well-fed. Its two horns were very strong. Jin Quan's father kept saying, "Good ox! Good ox!" He pulled this part to look at it, then pulled that part to look at it, constantly praising the ox's good points. "Look at those hind legs! Front legs! Not a single part is uneven?" He also said, "Come, let's see how it moves!" He led the ox for a few rounds, and everyone applauded. He also said, "Look at the ox's fur, it's as if it's been washed..." As he said this, he saw a patch of fur on the ox's back that seemed to be matted together. He turned around and went into the house, brought out his granddaughter-in-law's wooden comb, and reached out to comb the ox's back a few times, but it was still the same. His granddaughter-in-law went up to take a look and said with a smile, "Dad! That's a cowlick!" Everyone laughed, and Jin Quan's father laughed too. He said, "My eyes aren't working anymore!" He patted the ox's belly and said to his son, "Feed it well! It's almost time to plant wheat." Everyone said, "That's great! Our group has another ox!"

### 牛牵来了！

　　牛牵来了！
    在江苏省涟水城的东边，有个庄子，庄子上有家姓金的，有个儿子叫金铨。金铨家经过了土地改革，分到了二十多亩地，去年庄稼好收成，家里有了剩余。
    金铨一家，说起来，三代没有买过牛。打金铨爷起，到金铨爹，一直到金铨，要用牛都是借人家的。这下子有田有地又有剩余，全家讨论了一下，一定要买一头牛。金铨爹说：“我七十多岁了，一辈子也没买过牛，现在买得来，看看也舒心！”大家一合算，剩余的钱还够买条牛，就决定让金铨去买。金铨才二十，虽然自己家里没有牛，可是他从小就给人家当雇工，牛用得惯熟的。金铨爹说：“你去也好，我怕不能走远路。”
    金铨那天带了钱，准备上街，他媳妇向他说：“你就走了么？”金铨说：“不走还有什么？”他媳妇递给他一块红绫子。金铨认得是他媳妇出嫁时候包花用的。他不懂，问她：“这做什么？”他媳妇笑着说：“买牛要戴红，这也不晓得！”金铨笑了一笑，心里想不迷信也图个吉利，也就接过来，上街去了。
    在解放区的翻身农民看来，买牛，是一件大事，也是一件大喜事。七十多岁没养过牛的金铨爹，在金铨走后，心里尽想：“七十多年来，没有服侍过一条牛，现在没想到有牛了，牛就是聚宝盆。庄户人家什么是宝？牛就是宝！那里来的这日子？晚年走红运！多亏毛主席打下了江山，替穷人打算。”他一头想，一头心里喜孜孜的，就柱了拐棍，到四边邻居家去溜，见人就说：“今天我家买牛了！”他时时抬头望太阳，看看到金铨回来的时候没有？快晌午了，他想金铨要回来了，可是还不回来，金铨爹心里直念叨：“怎么还不回来呢？怎么还不回来呢？”他向孙媳妇说：“你不晓得没牛的苦处！求哥拜姐的还是小事，要等人家耕过了才能耕，赶上天时，赶不上地利。这下子有了牛，田里的生活，就好办了。”一直等到吃过中饭，牛还没来，金铨爹有些倦了，睡上床养养神。刚躺下，金铨回来了，门口孙媳妇喊了一声：“爹爹！牛牵来啦！”金铨爹什么瞌睡也没有了，赶忙从铺上起来，走到门口，只看见大场下边，金铨牵着一头黄健，牛角上缠着红绫，金光照眼、他满心欢喜地迎了上去，多少邻居也拥了上来。
    牛牵到门口拴好，仔细一看，四蹄蹬开，养得圆滚滚的，两只角非常雄壮。金铨爹连说：“好牛！好牛！”他拉这个看，又拉那个看，不停嘴地讲这牛好处“你看那后腿！前腿！没一处不匀称？”又说：“来，看看走手！”他牵着牛走了两阵，大家都叫好。他又说：“看这牛毛，象水洗的一样……”说到这儿，他看见牛背上有一块儿毛好象结在一起，回身就走到屋子里，把孙媳妇的木梳拿来，伸手就往牛的脊背上梳了几下，还是那样。孙媳妇上去看了看，笑着说：“爹爹！这是牛毛漩涡！大家都笑了，金铨爹也笑了，他说：眼睛不行啦！”又拍拍牛的肚子，对儿子说：“好好喂喂它！眼看就要种麦了。”大伙儿说：“这可好！我们这个小组又添了一条牛！”
