    【新华社陕北十九日电】据塔斯社莫斯科十五日讯：出席布拉格国际学联执委会会议的苏联学生代表团团员布鲁斯尼契金在返国后发表谈话称：执委会号召全世界的学生组织，在即将到来的二月二十一日——殖民地与附属国青年的团结日，声援殖民地与附属国青年的胜利斗争；号召他们在四月十四日——共和西班牙青年的团结日，声援西班牙青年的胜利斗争。执委会拥护世界民主青年联盟的建议，同意于今年八月间在布达佩斯共同组织一次青年与学生节。执委会并号召世界学生组织在这次大会中起积极的作用。执委会又决定一九五○年召开第二届世界学生代表大会。
    布鲁斯尼契金声称：参加此次布拉格会议工作的，有苏、英、法、中、捷、共和西班牙、印、波、丹、厄瓜多尔和其他许多国家的学生代表。国际学联主席格罗曼在他的报告中指出：在和平民主力量与反动好战力量之间斗争日益尖锐的气氛中，民主学生更紧密地团结在国际学联的周围，并为和平与美好的未来而加强斗争。各国学生在国际学生周寄了五万余封信给联合国秘书处，要求通过苏联关于裁军与禁止原子武器的和平建议。
