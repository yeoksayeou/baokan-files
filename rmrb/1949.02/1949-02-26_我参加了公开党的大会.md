　　I Attended the Open Party Congress
    Wang Lianlin, Worker at Yangquan Sanhe Factory
    On January 23rd, I attended the open Party meeting at our factory, and I was extremely happy. The higher-level Party committee explained the Party's general program and general policy to us very clearly, saying "The Communist Party is the party of the proletariat, representing the interests of the workers." After hearing this, my mind seemed much clearer. I immediately compared the workers of the past with the workers of the present: Recalling the past in the factories of the bureaucratic capitalists, we suffered cruel exploitation and oppression every day, and the workers were not treated as human beings, but like cattle and horses; not only was there no guarantee of life, but there was no room to speak. Every day was like being in prison, not a single day was pleasant. What about now? It is very different. Workers have gained political status and security in their lives, and a bright new China has emerged. I hope that every fellow worker will study hard in the future, improve themselves in politics, culture, and technology, be actively responsible in their work, regard the factory as their own home, work hard to produce, improve efficiency, and strive to be an excellent Communist Party member.

　　我参加了公开党的大会
    阳泉三合工厂工人王联林
    元月二十三日，我参加了我厂的公开党的会议，心里非常高兴。上级党委把党的总纲和总方针给我们讲的很清楚，说“共产党是无产阶级的政党，是代表工人利益的”。我听了之后，脑子好象清醒了大半。当时就把过去的工人与现在的工人作了个对比：回想起过去在官僚资本家的工厂里，每天受着残酷地剥削和压迫，把工人不当人看待，好象牛马一样；不仅生活没有保障，而且说话的余地也没有。每天象在监狱里似的，没有一天痛快。现在呢？大不相同了，工人在政治上有了地位，在生活上有了保障，光明的新中国是出现了。我希望每个工友同志，今后努力学习，在政治、文化、技术方面提高自己，在工作中积极负责，把工厂看成自己的家庭，努力生产，提高效率，争取做一个优秀的共产党员。
