Xinhua News Agency, Beiping, February 26th: The Beiping World Daily, run by Cheng Shewo, a Kuomintang (CC) element and pseudo-Legislator, was sealed up yesterday by the Beiping Military Control Commission of the Chinese People's Liberation Army. Although the newspaper wore a "non-partisan" mask and pretended to be progressive after the liberation of Beiping, in fact, since its resumption of publication in Beiping, it has always maintained an extremely hostile attitude towards the cause of the Chinese people's liberation. The newspaper has consistently supported the counter-revolutionary civil war launched by the Chiang Kai-shek bandit gang, and has done its utmost to slander the People's Liberation Army, the People's Liberation Areas, and the just movements of the people in the Kuomintang-controlled areas. One of the newspaper's famous arguments is that "in the current chaotic military situation, no one can be neutral," and therefore, for the people who opposed this counter-revolutionary civil war, the newspaper heartlessly called them "communist spies" and called on people to support the Kuomintang reactionary government's "suppression of bandits and elimination of traitors campaign." This counter-revolutionary newspaper, which was so vicious towards its own people, was extremely docile towards American imperialism and Japanese aggression, advocating the organization of an Asian anti-communist group, begging the United States to interfere in China's internal affairs, believing that otherwise "it would be impossible to stop the spread of communism." The newspaper's counter-revolutionary stance was so firm that it even openly opposed the eight peace conditions put forward by Chairman Mao Zedong of the Chinese Communist Party on January 14 this year. The Beiping Municipal Military Control Commission, in order to deprive counter-revolutionary elements of freedom of speech and publication and to protect the people's freedom of speech and publication, decided to close down the newspaper. The Beiping World Evening News, also run by Cheng Shewo, was also closed down at the same time. The evil deeds of these two newspapers are well-known, and the people's public opinion circles in this city have repeatedly demanded that the People's Government prohibit their continued publication. Upon hearing the news that the two newspapers had been sealed up, the people were overjoyed.

　　北平军管会查封世界日报
  　该报一贯凶恶地反革命反人民
    【新华社北平二十六日电】国民党（ＣＣ）分子伪立法委员成舍我主办的北平世界日报，已于昨日被中国人民解放军北平军事管制委员会查封。该报虽然戴着“无党派”的假面具，并在北平解放以后伪装进步，但是事实上该报自从在北平复刊以来，对于中国人民解放事业始终抱着极端仇视的态度。该报一贯地拥护蒋介石匪帮所发动的反革命内战，对于人民解放军、人民解放区和国民党统治区人民的正义运动，极尽诬蔑之能事。该报的著名主张之一，是认为“目前混乱军事，任何人无中立之可能”，因此对于反对这种反革命内战的人民，该报忍心害理地称为“匪谍”，号召人们拥护国民党反动政府的“清匪除奸运动”。这个对本国人民如此凶恶的反革命报纸，对于美国帝国主义和日本侵略势力却百般驯顺，鼓吹组织亚洲反共集团，哀求美国干涉中国内政，认为否则“欲制止共产党之伸展势不可能”。该报的反革命立场如此坚决，直至中国共产党毛泽东主席在今年一月十四日提出八项和平条件时，该报尚公然予以反对。北平市军事管制委员会为了剥夺反革命分子的言论出版自由而保障人民的言论出版自由，决定将该报封闭。对于亦由成舍我主办的北平世界晚报，亦同时予以封闭。此两报恶迹昭彰，本市人民舆论界早已一再要求人民政府禁止其继续出版，在闻悉两报被查封后，人心大快。
