　　Not Complacent After Praise
  　Xiaowei Camp Cooperative Grows Steadily
    [Taihang News] After the Xiaowei Camp Cooperative in the Second District of Qinyang was praised by the Taihang Xinhua Daily last September, all employees were very happy. Zhang Yunhai, the director of the cooperative, immediately convened a meeting with village cadres, the board of directors, and the cooperative's workers and staff, saying, "The reason our village's cooperative is doing well is because of the care of the masses and everyone's active efforts. We must not be complacent, but instead lead the masses well in production and become prosperous." During the winter production season, the cooperative again played an active role in organizing production. At the beginning of winter, the village's coal mine broke down, and the masses lacked ways to produce; the cooperative organized 87 people and 8 ox carts to go up the mountain to transport coal. Those who didn't have capital were given loans. A coal depot was opened to take charge of sales, saving the masses time selling coal. In the past, it took one day to transport and one day to sell, but now one trip can be made in one day, and lodging expenses are saved. The cooperative opened a new pot depot, organizing 72 people to carry pots from Shanxi to Zhengzhou to sell; it also organized 28 people to transport sesame seeds from the Fourth District to supply the cooperative for oil pressing. In two months, the masses earned more than 279,000 yuan (new currency) from transportation alone. In addition, the village's sawing stone pencil sideline production, because the sales of stone pencils were slow at the beginning of winter, the cooperative actively tried to sell 24,000 of them on consignment, and continued to send people to Xingtai to promote sales, making sawing stone pencils become in short supply, and more than 140 people became involved in sawing stone pencil production. From August of last year to now, the cooperative has withdrawn 500,000 yuan of shares, using the method of repeatedly lending and repaying, to support villagers in buying 30 head of livestock. The reason why the cooperative can play an active role in organizing production is mainly because it adopts a democratic management system, with regular meetings of cooperative members, open accounts, listening to members' opinions, and flexible business operations. It uses deposits to change to shares, and shares to change to deposits (depositors deposit, with a monthly interest of five percent, calculated daily, and can be withdrawn at any time; if the deposit period is equal to the accounting and profit-sharing period, the deposit can be changed into shares, with the same profit-sharing. If shares are freely withdrawn, the monthly deposit interest rate of five percent can be calculated.) This is convenient and beneficial for the masses, and the cooperative's shares have therefore expanded. Last July, the shares were more than 130,000 yuan, and by the end of the year, they had expanded to more than 530,000 yuan.

　　得到表扬不自满
  　校尉营合作社愈发展
    【太行讯】沁阳二区校尉营合作社去年九月经太行新华日报表扬后，全体职工人员非常高兴。社长张云海马上邀集村干董事会和合作社工人、职员开会说：“咱村合作社办得好，是群众爱护和大家积极努力才搞好的，我们可不要自满，更要好好领导群众生产，发家致富。”在冬季生产中，该合作社又起了积极组织生产的作用。冬季开始时，本村煤窑坏了，群众缺乏生产门路；合作社组织了八十七人、牛车八辆上山运煤。有的人没本钱就借给。并开了个煤栈，负责推销，省出群众卖煤时间，过去运一天卖一天，现在一天可以运一趟，并省了住店盘费。合作社新开一个锅栈，组织群众七十二人到山西担锅到郑州卖；又组织廿八人到四区运芝麻供给合作社打油。两个月中，群众单搞运输就赚二十七万九千余元（新币）。此外，本村锯石笔副业生产，因冬季开始时石笔销路不快，合作社积极设法代销了两万四千把，又继续派人到邢台推销，使锯石笔变成了供不应求，一百四十余人卷入了锯石笔生产。去年八月到现在，合作社抽出股金五十万元，用屡贷屡还办法，扶植村民买牲口三十头。该合作社所以能起组织生产的积极作用，主要是采取民主管理制度，社员会定期召开，公开帐目，听取社员意见，业务经营自由灵活，用存款变股金，股金变存款办法，（存款户存款，月利五分，按日计算利息，可随时提，如存款期限相等于结帐分红期限，可将存款变为股金，同样分红。如自由抽股，可按存款月息五分计算。）对群众方便有利，合作社股金亦因此扩大。去年七月十三万余元股金，到年底已扩大到五十三万余元。
