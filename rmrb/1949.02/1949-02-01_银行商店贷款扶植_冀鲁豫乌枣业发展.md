Hebei, Shandong, Henan, and Northern Jiangsu dispatch: Bank and store loans support the development of jujube industry.

[Hebei, Shandong, Henan and Northern Jiangsu Electric] With the support of banks and state-owned stores, the production of black dates in the Sixth Special District (including nine counties of Boping, Chiping, Liaocheng, Dong'a, Hexi, Qiyu, Chibei, Xuyi, and Liaoyang) has increased. Currently, state-owned stores are actively organizing exports to solve sales problems. Black dates are a specialty of the Sixth Special District, transported and sold to various parts of Henan. It is a relatively common side-line production for local farmers in autumn. During the jujube ripening season, the masses are as busy as with the autumn and wheat harvests. Last year, loans of grain from banks and public stores solved the financial difficulties of the black date industry, enabling it to develop. Therefore, although the Hua jujube suffered from insect pests in the spring, reducing production by about two-thirds compared to previous years, the output of black dates still increased significantly. According to statistics, there are 1,195 black date factories in the entire district (mostly joint-stock or labor-capital joint ventures), producing a total of more than 6,046,000 catties of black dates. This is an increase of more than 33.8 percent compared to the previous year. Due to the increase in the production of black dates, the price of Hua jujubes has also increased. The average price of 100 catties of Hua jujubes was equivalent to 32 catties of wheat the year before last. Last year, it rose from 65 catties to 100 catties. If the average price is 75 catties of wheat per 100 catties, then each 100 catties can be sold for 43 catties more wheat than the year before last, meaning that the entire district can sell 6,340,000 more catties of wheat than the year before last. This is a huge income for the farmers in the area. Exporting black dates at a selling price of eight yuan per catty (converted to new currency, the same below) can offset more than 48,372,000 yuan in foreign exchange. If profits are added, the amount will be much higher. However, there are currently great difficulties in the sales of black dates because foreign businessmen cannot come, and inland merchants cannot easily go out, resulting in a price decline. Therefore, planned exports have become an urgent issue. The district government and state-owned stores recently held a joint meeting of various public enterprises to specifically study the issue of black date exports, determining that banks should grant extensions on the repayment of loans for black dates and that various state-owned departments should help find sales channels for black dates. Currently, Taixinglong State-owned Store has absorbed more than 870,000 catties of black dates and has transported 170,000 catties to Jinan and Jining. According to Liaocheng statistics, from October to the present, 174,000 catties have been processed for export in the city, and have been sent to Xuzhou, Wuxi, Tianjin and other places. Currently, the price of black dates has risen by about one yuan per catty, and the black date market is gradually becoming active again.

### 银行商店贷款扶植　冀鲁豫乌枣业发展

　　银行商店贷款扶植
  　冀鲁豫乌枣业发展
    【冀鲁豫电】六专区（包括博平、茌平、聊城、东阿、河西、齐禹、茌北、徐翼、聊阳等九县）的乌枣生产在银行与国营商店扶植下产量增加，目前国营商店正积极组织输出，解决销路问题。乌枣是六专区的特产，运销河南各地。是当地农民秋季较普遍的副业生产。每逢枣熟季节，群众如同忙秋、麦。去年银行及公营商店贷粮解决了乌枣业的资金困难，使乌枣业得以发展。因此虽然春天滑枣遭虫害较往年减产约三分之二，但乌枣产量仍大增。据统计全区共有乌枣厂一千一百九十五家（大部是群众合股或劳资合营的），共产乌枣达六百零四万六千余斤。较前年增产百分之三十三点八强。由于乌枣的生产增加，滑枣价格因以提高。前年每百斤滑枣平均合麦三十二斤，去年由六十五斤涨到一百斤。如平均以每百斤合麦七十五斤计，则较前年每百斤可多卖麦子四十三斤，即全区枣可比前年多卖麦六百三十四万余斤。对该区农民是一笔巨大的收入。乌枣出口按售价每斤八元（折新币下同）计算，可抵外汇四千八百三十七万二千余元。若再加利润，则大大超过此数。但目前乌枣销路存在极大困难，因外商来不到，内地商人不易出去，以致价格下跌。故有计划的输出已成为迫切问题。该区政府及国营商店最近乃召开各公营企业联席会，专门研究乌枣输出问题，确定银行对乌枣贷实缓期催交，各国营部门帮助乌枣找销路。现在泰兴隆国营商店已吸收乌枣八十七万余斤，已运往济南与济宁共十七万斤。据聊城统计十月份至现在，本城办理出口手续者有十七万四千余斤，已送往徐州、无锡、天津等地，现乌枣价格每斤已上升一元左右，乌枣市场又渐趋活跃。
