　　Launch a Mass Patriotic Health Campaign

　　I. Public Health Work is a Pressing Demand of the Masses
　　The land reform in North China has basically been completed, the feudal system has been eliminated, and the armed enemy will also be completely eliminated. The pressing issues now are, in addition to production, culture, and education, that when the masses get sick, ways must be found to carry out universal treatment. Diseases such as smallpox, measles, scarlet fever, typhoid, cholera, dysentery... are spreading across the region, some lightly, some severely. The high incidence and mortality rates are quite alarming in some areas. For example, in the fourth district of Taihang, with a population of 802,510, more than 60,000 people fell ill during the most severe epidemic seasons last spring and autumn, with an incidence rate of about 8% of the population. In the Jizhong area, the epidemic affected 21 counties and 119 villages during the severe summer and autumn epidemics last year, with 22,855 cases, greatly affecting production.
　　In addition, after acquiring land, the masses hope to have more children and want prosperity for both people and wealth. However, the infant mortality rate is also quite high. According to surveys conducted in several villages last year, a comprehensive survey of Lantou Village in the fourth district of Jinnan and individual villages in Handan and Wu'an found that infant deaths from umbilical cord infections (i.e., tetanus, commonly known as "four-six wind") averaged about 65%. Because of unsanitary traditional midwifery practices, many women also develop puerperal fever, and some are left with other gynecological diseases. Gynecological diseases account for 32% of the total number of patients seen at the Taihang Hospital's outpatient clinic throughout the year. Statistics from the gynecology department of the Harbin General Hospital's outpatient clinic show that almost 100% of rural women who come to the clinic are there because they want to have children. The inability to bear children is a great suffering for rural women.
　　Based on the above situation, it is clear that public health work must be carried out. This is of great significance to our current central task of developing production and construction in North China and continuing to support the front lines.
　　II. Launching a Mass Patriotic Health Campaign
　　The prevalence of rural epidemics is a disaster left to the people by the old society. However, our democratic governments in the liberated areas have always been concerned about the serious disease problems in rural areas. For several years, governments at all levels and the vast number of doctors in our North China liberated areas have led the people in fighting diseases and epidemics, and have launched extensive mass patriotic health campaigns in conjunction with cultural and educational work. Valuable experiences have been gained in this regard, which are of great significance for the future conduct of health work.
　　For example, in Meng County, Jinzhong, the Pujizhou Hospital was established in 1946. Initially, the administrative office provided a loan of three million. Fearing that local doctors would not manage it well, the county established a Medical Research Association and established a consultation system. To make it convenient for the masses to see doctors and take medicine, a County Medical Cooperative was also established. In terms of treatment, Chinese medicine and acupuncture were used, with minimal charges, which was supported by the masses. The hospital grew from small to large, generally equipped with both Chinese and Western medicines, eliminating the barriers between Chinese and Western doctors and between the masses and doctors. Later, realizing that one hospital and one medical cooperative could not solve the medical problems of the county's 160,000 people, they began with active epidemic prevention. In addition to vaccinating against smallpox and injecting preventive vaccines, they also mobilized the masses to systematically establish county and district medical associations, district and village health committees, health groups, or health workers, and established reporting, meeting, and cleanliness inspection systems. When an infectious disease occurred in a village, the county and district could immediately know and organize doctors to carry out intensive treatment. School education and cultural and artistic work were also coordinated to carry out publicity and education in various forms, such as oral, written, and theatrical performances. Since then, diseases and deaths have been reduced, and the remnants of feudal superstition have been eliminated.
　　The Guanghua Hospital, a jointly run public-private hospital in the third district of Taiyue, was opened in 1944 with a government loan of 50,000 yuan, initially operated by several local doctors jointly. Later, it expanded its business by combining mass shares and investing in kind, and went to the mountains to collect medicinal herbs and refine them. In 1946, the hospital established a health worker training class, teaching apprentices to learn how to collect and make medicine and promote local products. Later, under the cooperative management of "the masses are shareholders and cadres are directors," a supply and marketing cooperative was established. Now it has developed into tens of millions of capital, and the hospital has become one of its units. Chinese and Western doctors and Chinese and Western medicines are generally available, helping districts and villages solve the difficulties of having no doctors and no medicines, and carrying out epidemic prevention, health implementation, and publicity and education. The masses cherish their own cause very much.
　　The Dalingxiao Village Medical Cooperative in Shen County, Jizhong, which is run jointly by the village and the public, has members accounting for more than 80% of the village's population and is treated by an experienced Chinese medicine doctor from the village. The masses voluntarily proposed to the government to exempt him from labor duties, and democratically elected five cadres (who do not leave production) to take turns on duty in the cooperative, and daily income and expenditure are announced at any time. Now the cooperative has developed to the point where it can help solve some of the medical difficulties in nearby villages, and can even actively prevent smallpox by vaccinating.
　　In order to transform the old-style midwifery in Jinnan, rural midwifery training classes were established. In the first phase, more than ten people were gathered, using books as textbooks, and classes were conducted in the form of seminars, taking a step forward in improving their existing midwifery techniques. After fifteen days of training, the results were very good. They understood that the occurrence of umbilical cord infection and puerperal fever is caused by unscientific midwifery. They learned new methods of disinfecting and cutting the umbilical cord and treating the mother's genitals.
　　In other areas, such as Taihang and Beiyue, when epidemics broke out in some counties, local Chinese and Western doctors were immediately organized into groups of three to five, and several groups were formed to cooperate with other work and carry out intensive treatment, quickly stopping the spread of the epidemic. In Jiluyu and Jinnan, in order to break the masses' superstition (five or six thousand people asked for divine water to cure diseases every day), medical teams were quickly organized to publicize and treat diseases at the same time. Soon, this superstition was broken. In the treatment, it was found that there were a lot of black fever and roundworm diseases, and environmental sanitation was immediately carried out to reduce the incidence rate. Jizhong also organized rescue teams to carry out epidemic prevention and treatment in areas where diseases such as measles and scarlet fever were prevalent, organized primary school students to dress up for publicity, theatrical performances, publicity by witches and gods who had been educated, and publicity by cured patients, etc., which greatly improved the masses' health knowledge, extinguished the spread of epidemics, and reduced mortality.
　　According to incomplete statistics, in the process of fighting against diseases, superstitions, and unsanitary conditions, the whole region has established 99 public hospitals above the county level, which can accommodate more than 6,000 people. There are 359 medical cooperatives, 16 health centers, 3 health schools, 1 medical college, and 2 nursing training teams in counties, districts, and villages, with a total of more than 630 students. More than 20,000 Chinese medicine doctors have also been organized.
　　Although all these achievements and experiences in various places are still preliminary and piecemeal, they fully demonstrate that local health work must adopt the mass line, go deep into the masses, and serve the masses, so that the health campaign can be widely carried out. Therefore, these achievements and experiences should be promoted and become the direction for us to carry out future work.
　　However, we must not be satisfied with these achievements, and there are still many shortcomings that we need to work hard to improve. First of all, we must clarify the concept of "prevention is better than cure." At present, due to the lack of medical manpower in various places, the active prevention of diseases and epidemics beforehand is relatively poor. A few health workers only focus on regular hospitals and fail to carry out health popularization work based on the existing scientific level and economic foundation. The training of medical personnel also focuses on theory and has poor connection with practice, so that they are at a loss when they leave school. The publicity of epidemic prevention and health in various places is also insufficient, and the scientific level of the masses has not been well improved, so that witches and sorcerers still remain in the folk. These are all things that should be improved in the future.
　　III. Unite Chinese and Western Medicine
　　In order to smoothly carry out health work, we must unite Chinese and Western doctors. This is a problem that has been proven by the experience of various places.
　　Why should we unite Chinese medicine doctors? Because: First, Chinese medicine is originally a historical heritage of Chinese culture. Although it lacks basic scientific theories, such as scientific research on physiology, anatomy, pathology, and bacteria... it also has many departments. It has a certain accumulation of experience in distinguishing symptoms and treatment techniques, as well as delicate pharmacopoeias and many simple and effective prescriptions. As a legacy of the old culture, it can be transformed, and we medical students also have the responsibility to accept this heritage and criticize and transform it. Second, there are a large number of Chinese medicine doctors, almost universally in rural areas. In the North China region, we have organized and counted more than 100,000, while there are only more than 400 Western medicine doctors. The vast majority of people rely on them for treatment, and they have contact with the masses. Third, another aspect of Chinese medicine's mass base is that their methods of diagnosis and treatment are simple and convenient, and they can diagnose and prescribe medicine anytime and anywhere. The president of the Xingtai Municipal Hospital said: "Public hospitals provide free treatment, but the masses do not come. They would rather buy a few plasters, which are convenient to use and do not cost much." And the masses are familiar with general Chinese medicines. If a special prescription is introduced in the newspaper, they can buy it themselves. Western medicines are expensive and unfamiliar, so the masses like Chinese medicine to cure diseases. Therefore, we must unite Chinese medicine.
　　How to promote the unity of Chinese and Western medicine? Summarizing the existing experience in various places, it can be summarized into three points: First, we must correct two one-sided views. One says that he "only understands surgery," and the other says that he "understands yin and yang and the five elements." Chinese medicine doctors who use acupuncture say that only acupuncture is good, and those who use medicine only say that medicine is good. Among Western medicine doctors, there are also so-called German, British, and American schools. We must eliminate this attitude of mutual discrimination and replace it with the spirit of learning from each other's strengths and making up for each other's weaknesses. Second, there must be an organization. The establishment of medical associations in Jizhong, Jinzhong, and Xingtai, starting from the form of research meetings and seminars, first understanding the thoughts and concerns of Chinese medicine doctors, helping to solve difficulties in life, and gradually developing to the establishment of consultation, meeting, and political and technical learning systems, so that Chinese medicine doctors believe in Western medicine diagnosis, and Western medicine doctors believe in good Chinese medicine prescriptions, and are willing to serve the masses together, are all good experiences. But organizing also has a certain process, and we must patiently persist in leadership. Third, we must appropriately solve the difficulties of Chinese medicine doctors. After the land reform, there was insufficient care for the lives of some Chinese medicine doctors, causing some to change careers and others to be unable to take care of seeing patients and further improving themselves. They should be appropriately exempted from labor duties, Western medicine doctors should help with consultations and publishing publications, solve specific difficulties, and the sense of collective will increase.
　　IV. Current Tasks
　　Comprehensive information from various places shows that there is a lot of work to be done, but due to the limitations of our various conditions, we can only carry it out step by step, distinguishing between urgency and importance.
　　First, we must strengthen epidemic prevention work. Epidemic prevention is the active side of health work. With a little effort, many diseases can be reduced. It has a great effect on saving manpower, material resources, and financial resources. To this end, the minimum requirement is to vaccinate all children under the age of thirteen against smallpox, and to inject typhoid and cholera vaccines in cities and densely populated areas. For other infectious diseases, we should strengthen health administrative management, and combine schools and groups to use temple fairs, plays, and other opportunities to conduct health education and improve the masses' health knowledge.
　　Second, the central task of developing rural health at present is to start with maternal and child health. Childbearing and childcare are not only the personal problems of rural women, but also the problem of the next generation's population. Health departments above the administrative office level should focus on training midwives. The old-style midwifery should be universally transformed. Counties and districts can send people to villages to gather midwives and give them short-term training to scientifically cut the umbilical cord and treat the mother's genitals, reducing the mortality rate of umbilical cord infection and puerperal fever.
　　Third, medical cooperatives are most suitable for rural environment and economic conditions and should be widely promoted. As a minimum requirement, supply and marketing medical cooperatives should be established at the county level, and should be universally established in districts, and should also be established in villages if possible. We must also advocate the promotion of local medicines, encourage the collection, planting, and production of medicines.
　　Fourth, the completion of political tasks must rely on organizational work to ensure it. In terms of health administrative agencies, governments at all levels should set up competent health departments within the scope of the establishment according to the conditions of cadres. In terms of mass organizations, health guidance committees or health committees should be established below the county level according to environmental conditions, combined with medical associations or medical cooperatives to carry out work. Chinese and Western medicine doctors' associations or research associations should be established at the county level. Doctors who have changed careers during the land reform should be encouraged to resume their careers and their difficulties should be appropriately resolved. Once various organizations are established, they must establish a system and strengthen leadership.
　　Fifth, strengthen medical care. Medical work is the passive side of health work; but when epidemics are prevalent, medical care is also one of the active epidemic prevention work, which can usually discover the occurrence of epidemics and promote attention to epidemic prevention and health. Therefore, public hospitals should be added above the special zone level, and more Chinese medicine and acupuncture therapies should be adopted, charging only the cost of medicines. Public-private hospitals or clinics should be added in counties and districts, with public loans and food loans to help solve difficulties at any time.
　　In addition, in terms of training cadres, on the basis of popularization, we should also not give up focusing on gradually improving technology, and training senior medical personnel and health administrative cadres.

　　开展群众性的卫生运动
    朱＠
    一、卫生工作是群众的迫切要求
    华北土地改革基本上已完成，封建制度已消灭，武装敌人亦将全部肃清。现在提出的迫切问题，除生产文化教育外，就是群众有了病，要想办法进行普遍治疗天花、麻疹、猩红热、伤寒、霍乱、痢疾……等病，在全区各地此起彼落或轻或重的流行着，发病率与死亡率的高，在某些部分地区是相当惊人的。例如：太行四专区人口八十万二千五百一十人，在去年春秋两季疫病流行最严重时，病倒六万多，发病率约占人口百分之八。冀中区，去年夏秋疫病流行严重时达二十一个县，一百十九个村，发病数二万二千八百五十五人，大大影响了生产。
    另外，群众在获得土地之后，希望多生小孩，要求人财两旺。可是婴儿死亡率亦相当高，据去年若干村的调查，冀南四分区兰头村及邯郸武安等个别村的全面调查，统计婴儿死亡在脐带风（即破伤风，俗名叫四六风）的平均约占百分之六十五。因为旧式接产不卫生，产妇发生产褥热的也很多。也有遗留下其他妇科病的。太行医院门诊全年诊病数内，妇科病占总数百分之三十二。哈里总医院门诊部妇科室统计，农村妇女来看病的，几乎百分之百是为了要生小孩。农村妇女不生育小孩，是莫大的苦痛。
    根据以上情况，可知必须开展卫生工作。这对于我们当前发展华北生产建设继续支援前线的中心任务，是有重要意义的。
  　二、开展群众卫生运动
    农村疫病的流行，是旧社会遗留给人民的灾难。但我们解放区的民主政府，却历来是关心着农村中严重的疾病问题的，几年以来，我华北解放区各级政府及广大医生均曾领导人民同疾病瘟疫作斗争，与文教工作结合起来开展了广泛的群众性的卫生运动。在这方面各地都获有宝贵的经验，这对今后卫生工作的进行是有重要意义的。
    如晋中盂县一九四六年开办普济医院，先是行署贷款三百万，由地方医生经营怕办不好，县里成立医药研究会，建立会诊制度。为了使群众看病吃药都方便，又成立县医药合作社。治病方面，采用中药与针灸，收费轻微。得到群众拥护。医院由小变大，一般中西药兼备，消除了中西医生之间、群众与医生之间的隔阂。以后感到一个医院一个医药合作社不可能解决全县十六万人口的治病问题，便从积极的防疫着手，除施种牛痘注射防疫针外，又发动群众有系统的建立了县区医药联合会、区村卫生委员会、卫生小组或卫生员等，建立了汇报会议和检查清洁卫生的制度。那一村发生传染病，县区便可立即知道，组织医生去突击治疗。学校教育与文艺工作也配合起来，进行口头的、文字的、戏剧的各种形式的宣传教育，从此减少了疾病死亡，破除了封建迷信的残余。
    太岳三专区民办公助的广华医院，在一九四四年开办时，公家贷款五万元，先由几位地方医生合资经营。以后结合群众股金，以实物投资方式扩大营业，并上山采药，提炼精制。一九四六年该院附设卫生员训练班，以带徒弟方式，学习采药制药，推广土产。以后在“群众是股东，干部当长江”的合作经营下，成立供销合作社，现在发展到几千万资本，医院变为其中的一个单位，中西医生、中西药品一般均有，帮助区村解决了无医生无药的困难，并进行防疫卫生的实施与宣传教育，群众非常爱护他们自己创办的事业。
    冀中深县大凌霄村民办公助的医药合作社，社员占全村人口百分之八十以上，由本村一位经验丰富的中医担任治疗。群众自愿向政府提出免除他的负担出勤，并民选五位干部（不脱离生产）在社内轮流值日，日常收支随时公布。现该社已发展到能帮助解决附近其他村的一些医药困难，更能从积极方面进行施种牛痘防止天花了。
    冀南为改造旧式接产，创办农村接产妇训练班，一期集合十余人，用图书为课本，以座谈会方式进行上课，在她们现有接产技术上提高一步，十五天训练完毕，成绩很好。她们懂得了脐带风和产褥热的发生，是由于不科学的接产所引起。她们学会了新式消毒剪脐带与处理产妇阴部的方法。
    其他如太行、北岳有些县份疫病流行时，立刻组织地方中西医三五人一小组，编成若干小组，配合其他工作，进行突击治疗，迅速阻止了疫病的蔓延。冀鲁豫、冀南为破除群众迷信（每日有五六千人求神水治病）迅速组织医疗队，一面宣传，一面治病，不久就将此迷信破除。在冶病中发现黑热病与蛔虫病极多，立刻进行环境卫生，减少发病率。冀中并组织救护队到麻疹猩红热等病流行区进行防疫治疗，组织小学生化装宣传、戏剧宣传，由教育过来的巫神宣传，由治愈的病人宣传等等，对提高群众卫生知识，扑灭疫病蔓延，减低死亡率，收效很大。
    按不完全的统计，全区在与疾病、迷信、不卫生作斗争的过程中，已建立了县以上公立医院九十九个，可收容六千多人。县区村的医药合作社三百五十九个、卫生所十六个、卫生学校三个、医专一个、护士训练队两个，现共收学生六百三十余名。并组织了二万多名中医。
    所有各地这些成绩与经验，虽然还是初步的点滴的，但已充分说明了地方卫生工作，必须采取群众路线，深入群众，为群众服务，卫生运动就能广泛的开展。因此，这些成绩与经验，应该推广，成为我们开展今后工作的方向。
    但是我们的工作绝不能以此为满足，还有许多缺点，须要我们努力改进。首先就是要把“防病胜于治病”这一观念明确起来，目前各地由于医药人力缺乏，事前积极的对于病疫的防范做的均较差，有少数卫生工作同志只偏重正规医院，未能从现有的科学水平与经济基础出发，进行卫生普及工作。对于医务人材的培养亦偏重理论，联系实际较差，以致一出学校束手无策，各地对于防疫卫生的宣传，也是不够，没有很好提高群众的科学水平，以致巫师神婆至今还留传民间，这都是今后应加努力改进的。
  　三、中西医团结起来
    为使卫生工作顺利开展，我们必须团结中西医生，这是各地经验中所证明了的问题。
    为什么要团结中医？因为：第一、中国医学原是中国文化的历史遗产，它虽然缺乏基本的科学理论，如生理、解剖、病理、细菌……等科学研究，但它分科也很多。在辨别症候与治疗技术上，有一定的经验积累，也有细腻的药本与很多简便有效的单方。作为旧文化遗生来说，它是可以改造，我们学医的人也有责任接受这遗产加以批判改造的。第二、中医的数量很多，几乎普遍在农村。华北全区我们已组织者，统计即有十万之多，而西医仅四百余人，广大群众都依靠他们治病，他们与群众有联系。第三、中医有群众基础的另一方面，是他们诊病用药的方法简便，随时随地就可诊病，开个药单，到药铺就买到。邢台市民医院院长说：“公家医院免费治病，群众不来看，他宁可买几块狗皮膏药，用起来方便，化钱又不多。”且一般中药，群众也都熟悉，报上介绍一个特效单方，自己就可买来用，西药既贵又不认识，所以群众喜欢中医冶病。因此，我们必须团结中医。
    怎样推进中西医的团结呢？综合各地的现有经验，可以归纳为三点：第一、必须纠正两个片面的看法。一个说他“只懂外科”，另一个说他“阴阳五行”，中医中用针灸的，说只有针灸的好，用药的只说药好，西医中也有什么日德派英美派等，这种互相歧视的态度，我们必肃清，代之以取长补短互相学习的精神。第二、必须要有组织。冀中、晋中、邢台等地的医药联合会的成立，从研究会座谈会方式，首先了解中医的思想顾虑，帮助解决生活上的困难，逐渐发展到建立会诊、会议、学习政治与技术等制度，使中医信仰西医的诊断，西医相信中药良方，愿共同为群众服务，都是很好的经验。但组织起来也是有一定的过程，须耐心的坚持领导。第三、要适当解决中医的困难问题。在土地改革以后，对有些中医的生活照顾不够，致使有的转业，有的顾不上看病与进一步提高自己，应适当免除负担出动，西医帮助会诊及出版刊物，解决了具体困难，集体观念就会增加了。
  　四、目前任务
    综合各地情况，要做的工作很多，但是由于我们各种条件的限制，我们只能有步骤的分别缓急来进行。
    一、必须加强防疫工作。防疫是卫生工作积极的一面，稍微努力一下，就能少发生很多病。对人力物力财力的节省作用很大。为此，最低限度要做到十三岁以下的儿童普种牛痘，在城市与人口集中的地区注射伤寒、霍乱疫苗。对其他传染病，应加强卫生行政管理，结合学校团体利用庙会演戏等机会，进行卫生教育，提高群众卫生常识。
    二、目前开展农村卫生的中心工作，首先要从妇婴卫生着手。生育保育不仅是农村妇女的切身问题，而更是后一代人口问题。行署以上卫生机关，应该有重点的培养助产士。普遍的改造旧式接产，可由县、区派人去村集中接产妇，给以短期训练，做到科学的剪脐带与处理产妇阴部，减少脐带风死亡率与产褥热。
    三、医药合作社最适合农村环境与经济条件，应大量推广。最低限度要以县为单位设立供销性的医药合作社，区应普遍建立，村子如有可能亦应建立。并须提倡推广土产药，奖励采药、种药，制药。
    四、政治任务的完成，必须依靠组织工作去保证。卫生行政机构方面，各级政府应在编制范围内按干部条件设立卫生工作主管部门。在群众性组织方面，县以下要按环境条件成立卫生指导委员会或卫生委员会，结合医药联合会或医药合作社，进行工作。并以县为单位成立中西医生联合会或研究会。在土地改革中转业的医生，应鼓励其复业，适当解决其困难。各种组织一经建立，必须建立制度，加强领导。
    五、加强医疗。医疗工作是卫生工作消极的一面；但在疫病流行时，医疗又是积极防疫工作之一，平时可发现流行病之产生，推动注意防疫卫生。故专区以上应增设公立医院，较多的采用中药与针灸疗法，只收药品成本费。县区应增设民办公助的医院或诊疗所，公家贷款贷粮，随时帮助解决困难。
    此外，培养干部方面，在普及的基础上，同时不放弃有重点的逐步提高技术，培养高级医务人员与卫生行政干部。
