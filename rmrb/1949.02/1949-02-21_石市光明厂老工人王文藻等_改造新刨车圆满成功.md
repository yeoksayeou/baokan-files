　　Highly Develop the Creative Spirit of the Proletariat
  　Old Workers Wang Wenzao and Others from Shijiazhuang's Guangming Factory
    Successfully Renovate New Planing Machine
    [Reported by This Newspaper] Wang Wenzao, the machine squad leader of the machine room, and Huo Zhenbo, the squad leader of the boiler room, from the Guangming Factory in Shijiazhuang City, have successfully overcome difficulties and built a planing machine themselves. After returning from preparations for war last November, Section Chief Dou Hongxun discussed making a planing machine with them, but neither of them had ever made one before, and they were not confident. Later, they went to the North China Iron Factory to see how others made them, and after some research, they tried to improve on it. After repeated research and review, they finally succeeded. Except for the simple planing machine body, which was cast according to the appearance of others, the rest of the vertical tool holder cross plate, automatic tool-up gear, reversing car bumping plate, pulley shaft, tool-up eight-character wheel horizontal shaft, large vertical tool holder dead bar, small vertical tool holder dead bar, and dead bar, handwheel, and other complete sets of parts, more than 50 pieces, were all improved and newly researched. In this complete set of parts, many small parts are connected, such as a set of reversing car smashing plates consisting of six kinds of small parts. In the entire production process of never having personally made one before, but designing drawings, casting and assembling a four-foot new planing machine, it was finally completed in just over a month. After the re-production of the new planing machine, an eight-foot circular car is about to be made (the eight-foot circular car's bed surface was planed by a planing machine from the Yuhua Iron Factory, because the new planing machine is only four feet and cannot plane the eight-foot circular car's bed surface), and two six-foot circular cars. Regarding the reason why they were able to make new machines, Wang Wenzao and Huo Zhenbo compared and said: "Under the management of the Germans, the Japanese, and after the Kuomintang took over, no matter how many dynasties passed, it was the same despotism. Even if you took your heart out for them, they would still say you deserved it. If you did a good job, it wouldn't be to your credit; if you did a bad job, you couldn't afford it. In front of the bosses, as long as you were eloquent and good at talking, you would appear capable. Those who actually do the work were still not appreciated. Workers with skills and techniques could not use them. Besides, who would be willing to work hard for the imperialists and bureaucratic capitalists?! Workers earned a few pennies with sweat and oil, and were still pressured to spend less at the beginning of the month. Who could bear to let them pressure you while starving? Now that the Communist Party has come, the factory was built by the workers themselves, and they have become the masters of the factory. The factory leadership has promoted democracy, economic openness, and clear rewards and punishments. This has made the workers proactive. Once they are proactive, they feel happy in their hearts, and they work for themselves, so they bury their minds in the work. As long as you do the work, your talent cannot be buried. Now, we can really use our skills!"

　　高度发挥无产阶级的创造精神
  　石市光明厂老工人王文藻等
    改造新刨车圆满成功
    【本报讯】石市光明厂机器房机器班长王文藻，锅炉房班长霍振波两同志克服困难自造刨车已获成功。自去年十一月备战回来，工程科长窦洪勋和他们两人商量自作刨车，但谁也没亲手作过，没有把握，后就到华北铁工厂去参观人家作的样子，经过一番研究，他们就设法改进，经反复研究检讨，终于成功。他们除简单的刨车床身是按人家的样子翻砂倒出的，其余立刀架横板、自动上刀拨齿、倒正车碰盘、皮带轮轴、起刀架八字轮横轴、大立刀架死杠、小立刀架死杠，及死杠、手轮等成套的零件五十多件，都是经过改进新研究出来的，在这成套的零件中，又是许多小零件连接而成，如一套倒正车砸板就由六种小零件组成。在从未亲自作过，而由设计绘图，铸造按装成一部经过改进的四尺新刨车的全部生产过程，终于用月余时间完成了。经过新刨车的再生产，至今又即将制出八尺圆车一部（八尺圆车是经过裕华铁工厂刨车刨的床面，因新刨车只四尺，刨不了八尺圆车床面），六尺圆车两部。他们所以能够制出新机器的原因，王文藻和霍振波对比说：“在德国人管理厂子，日本人管理厂子，以及国民党劫收以后，不管经过几个朝代，都是一样的专制，你把心都给他摘出来，他还说你活该，作好了没你的功，作坏了你可担不起，在头儿们跟前，只要嘴巧会说话就显得能干，下面干实活的，还是个吃不开，工人有手艺有技术就不能发挥，再说工人谁肯给帝国主义、官僚资本家卖力呢！？工人汗一把，油一把挣几个钱，到月头还压着开支，谁还能挨着饿叫他压呢？到现在共产党来了，厂子是工人建起来的，自个成了厂子的主人翁，厂子领导上发扬了民主，经济公开，赏罚严明，这一下工人们就主动了，一主动心里就高兴，作活是为了工人自己，干起来脑筋就埋到活里了，只要你作出活，就埋没不了你的材干，现在真能发挥技术了！”　　　（石基）
