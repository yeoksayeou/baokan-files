Xinhua News Agency, Xuzhou, 3rd. Workers, the poor, and employees of various trades in Xuzhou City are joyfully celebrating their first Spring Festival after liberation. The city's state-owned trading company has prepared a large quantity of grain, flour, oil, salt, etc., to retail to employees of various state-owned enterprises for the New Year. The Jinpu Railway Employees' Cooperative has purchased a large quantity of pork, peanut oil, soy sauce, rice, and millet from distant places for railway employees, with selling prices generally half of the market price. Ma Qiuying, a female worker at the Xingye Tobacco Company, recalled the past New Year's Eve, saying: "In the past, the New Year was for the rich, while the poor struggled to get by. Our family of nine relied solely on wages from work to survive, and we could only buy some coarse grains to make steamed buns for the New Year. This year is different; we received a bonus at the end of the year. Now we can buy some white flour for a happy New Year!" With the assistance and support of the democratic government in production, the vast number of poor citizens, having gained security in their lives, are also buying New Year's goods. More than 600 pigs were sold in the market in one day. Zhao Hengyang, a pork merchant from Beiguan, said: "The pigs slaughtered yesterday were sold out early this morning. There was never such a scene during the New Year in the past!" Xu Mingquan from the Fourth District bought two and a half catties of pork from Beiguan, saying with a smile: "After living for more than fifty years, I'm finally celebrating a good New Year. In the past, we could only buy two pieces of bean cake to eat and get by for the New Year. This year, it's truly a good New Year." He said: This is all thanks to the Communist Party. If Xuzhou hadn't been liberated, I don't know how we would have gotten through this year!

　　活了五十多岁才过第一个好年
  　徐州人民欢度春节
    【新华社徐州三日电】徐州市的工人、贫民和各业员工们都欢度着解放后的第一个春节。该市公营贸易公司准备了大批粮食、面、油盐等，零售给各公营企业员工们过年。津浦路职工合作社为铁路员工自远地购来大批猪肉、花生油、酱油、大米、小米等，出售价格一般低于市价二分之一。兴业烟草公司女工马秋英回忆过去的年关时说：“过去过年是富人过年，穷人过关，咱一家九口，光靠做工的工资过活，只能买点杂粮做个馒头过个年，今年可不同了，到年关奖励金，这下子可买点白面过个快活年了。”在民主政府救济和扶植下进行生产的广大贫苦市民，因为生活获得了保障，年关亦纷置年货。市场上一天内即卖出了六百余头猪，北关猪肉商赵恒洋说：“昨天杀的猪今天一早就卖光了，从前过年那有这个光景！”四区徐明全从北关买了二斤半猪肉，笑嘻嘻的说：“活了五十多年，才过到这个好年。往年只能买两块豆饼吃吃就过个年，到今年，才是真的过着好年了。”他说：这多亏了共产党，徐州不解放，还不知今年如何过法呢？
