Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 8th — Under American pressure, the so-called "Defense Alliance" conference held in Oslo by the Prime Ministers and Foreign Ministers of Norway, Denmark, and Sweden ended without result for the third time in a month on January 30th. According to a report from Teletype News Agency in Oslo, a joint communiqué issued by the three governments stated: "The defense conference did not reach an agreement on the issue of a Scandinavian alliance not bound by various alliances." In other words, the three Scandinavian countries did not agree to participate in the Atlantic war group led by the United States and Britain. Although the official communiqué insisted that the "Defense Conference" would continue, Danish Prime Minister Hedtoft declared unequivocally on the morning of January 30th that if the current Oslo Conference could not reach an agreement, no further Scandinavian talks would be held. The progressive newspaper in Copenhagen described the breakdown of the Northern "Defense Conference" as a reflection of the victory of the Scandinavian people. The resistance of the Scandinavian people to the war bloc plan has made it impossible for right-wing socialists to turn Scandinavian "defense" into part of America's war preparations. Teletype News Agency commented that although the Oslo Conference had broken down, the efforts of American and British imperialism to drag Scandinavia into the Atlantic Pact would continue. However, this will undoubtedly encounter even stronger resistance from the people, especially in Norway and Denmark, where the Communist Party is conducting a large-scale peace movement that has gained increasingly broad support from the masses.

　　奥斯陆会议破裂了
  　这正反映了北欧人民的胜利
    【新华社陕北八日电】在美国压力下，挪威、丹麦及瑞典三国总理及外长在奥斯陆举行的所谓“防御联盟”会议，又于一月三十日宣告无结果而散，这是一个月中间的第三次。据电通社奥斯陆讯，三国政府联合发表的公报称：“防御会议对不受各种联盟约束的斯堪的纳维亚联盟问题，未达协议。”换句话说，斯堪的纳维亚三国未同意参加美英领导下的大西洋战争集团。虽然官方公报硬说“防御会议”将继续举行，但丹麦总理赫多夫却在一月卅日早晨无保留地宣称：如果目前的奥斯陆会议不能达到协议，则将不再举行斯堪的纳维亚会谈。丹京哥本哈根进步报纸描述北方“防御会议”的破裂，是反映了斯堪的纳维亚人民的胜利。斯堪的纳维亚人民对战争集团计划的抵抗，使右翼社会党人把斯堪的纳维亚的“防务”变成美国之战争准备的一部分的阴谋，成为不可能。电通社评称：尽管奥斯陆会议破裂了，但是，美英帝国主义把斯堪的纳维亚拖入大西洋公约的努力仍将继续。不过，这将无疑遭遇更强大的人民的抵抗，特别是在挪威和丹麦，那里的共产党进行大规模的和平运动，已获得人民大众越来越广泛的支持。
