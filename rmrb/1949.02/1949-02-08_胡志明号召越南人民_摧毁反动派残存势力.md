　　Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, February 5th: Foreign telegrams report that Ho Chi Minh, President of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam, recently delivered a radio address, stating, "We are more certain than ever that we will win the final victory." In his speech, President Ho Chi Minh emphasized the importance of the overwhelming victory of the Chinese People's Liberation Army over the Kuomintang reactionaries. In his broadcast, President Ho Chi Minh revealed that imperialists are now attempting to win over "a section of people in Vietnam who are prepared to compromise" in order to reorganize their forces and make a dying struggle in the face of the people's victorious offensive. He specifically mentioned recent negotiations between the deposed King Bao Dai of Vietnam and France, and warned that when Bao Dai abdicated in 1945, he swore that he would never betray the Vietnamese people again, and if he goes back on his word and becomes a traitor, "he will receive the punishment that a traitor deserves." The Council of Ministers of the Democratic Government, under the leadership of President Ho Chi Minh, issued a communique calling on the Vietnamese people to overcome difficulties, mobilize all forces and resources, and launch a full-scale offensive against the remnant forces of French imperialism and its lackeys on Vietnamese territory in order to achieve true independence for Vietnam.
