　　Treatment for the Common Cold
    Colds are most likely to spread in winter and spring. This is because in these seasons, houses are often heated, and the temperature is higher than outside. Sudden temperature changes when going out make people susceptible to this illness. Therefore, when the weather is cold, special attention should be paid to avoid catching a chill, especially for children and those with weaker constitutions. Once contracted, it can easily turn into other illnesses.
    A cold and what ordinary people call a "common cold" are the same thing. Symptoms include a stuffy nose, runny nose, and sneezing. In more severe cases, it can become influenza, with fever, sometimes very high, body aches, coughing, sore throat, and loss of appetite. Because this disease affects the respiratory tract, if it progresses severely, it can easily develop into pneumonia, making the illness more serious and dangerous.
    People with colds should maintain warmth in their rooms and clothing, preferably resting quietly in bed, drinking plenty of boiled water, and eating soft, easily digestible food. When experiencing headaches and fever, avoid drafts. Drinking pepper soup and covering oneself with a quilt to sweat, or taking aspirin, can help recovery. If the cold already involves coughing and sweating does not help, it is best to drink balloon flower root soup, made by decocting two qian of balloon flower root and three qian of licorice root in water (children should take less). In severe cases, the dosage can be increased to five qian of balloon flower root and four qian of licorice root. If fever, cough, headache, etc., are very severe, a doctor should be consulted immediately.
    This disease is contagious. The sputum or excrement of patients should be buried. Avoid approaching those with colds unless necessary, and refrain from using items used by the sick before they have been disinfected. In addition, wear an extra layer of clothing when going out in winter, and remove it upon returning home. Avoid catching a cold by immediately removing clothing and hats after sweating from work.

### 伤风的治疗法

　　伤风的治疗法
    伤风，在冬天和春天最易流行，这是因为冬春季节，屋子里常常生着火，温度比外面高，从屋里出去时，温度骤然变化，最容易发生这种病，所以在天气冷的时候，要特别注意不要使身体受凉，尤其是小孩子和身体较弱的更应该当心。而且一经染上，便容易转变成其他的病。
    感冒和普通人说的伤风是一回事，病状是患者的鼻子不通气，流清鼻涕，打喷嚏。再厉害时便成为流行性感冒，身上发烧，有时烧得很厉害，全身就酸痛，咳嗽，嗓子发痛，不想吃东西。因为这种病是气管里的病，发展的厉害时，也往往容易演变成肺炎，那时病就会更加沉重，而且有危险。
    患伤风的人应注意保持屋里和穿衣的温暖，最好是静静地躺在床上，多喝一些开水，吃较稀软的食品。头痛发烧时不要吹风，可喝一些胡椒汤，盖上被子出汗，或者服阿司匹灵，便会痊愈。如果伤风已经咳嗽，发汗后仍不见效，最好喝桔梗汤，即：桔梗二钱、甘草三钱、煎水服下（小孩少服一些）。病到厉害时，分量可加重到桔梗五钱、甘草四钱。要是发烧，咳嗽、头痛等很厉害时，应立刻请医生检查。
    这种病能够传染人，凡病人的痰或大小便要把它埋掉，如果没有必要，不要接近害伤风病者，切忌在未消毒前用病人用过的东西。此外在冬天出外时要加添一件衣服，回家再脱下。凡做活出汗后，不要立即脱衣摘帽，以免伤风。
