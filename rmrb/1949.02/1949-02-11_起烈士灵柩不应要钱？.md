　　To the Editor:
    Wu Zhencai and Wu Qingke, relatives of martyr Wu Zhanguo from Wujiawan Village, Quyang County, went to Qiandubei Village, Fifth District, Huolu County, to exhume the remains of martyr Wu Zhanguo. The village chief ignored them. Li Shuangnian of the militia said: "If you want to exhume the remains, you have to buy two jin of wine and several jin of incense." The relatives of the martyr bought twelve liang of wine, but they complained it was too little, and stopped digging when the coffin was revealed. Li Shuangnian then demanded 50,000 yuan, saying it was a "regulation from above." The relatives of the martyr had to give Li Shuangnian 50,000 yuan of the travel expenses they had brought, causing Wu Zhencai and Wu Qingke to have no travel expenses when they arrived in Zhengding, making them cry bitterly.
    In addition, Wang Yingcai, a relative of martyr Wang Jide from Beiboshui Village, Fifth District, Tang County, went to Qiandubei Village, Huolu, to exhume the remains of martyr Wang Jide. When the martyr's cart was about to leave the village, the village chief Qi Yishun stopped the cart and demanded money, saying it was a "regulation from above," mobilizing everyone to pay 16,000 yuan, or they wouldn't be allowed to leave. The relatives of the martyr had no choice but to give him 20,000 yuan of their travel expenses, and after saying some good words, the matter was settled.
    We would like to ask, is it right for Qiandubei Village to ask us for money? Is there really such a regulation from above? If there is such a regulation, who should pay the money? If there is no such regulation, please forward this to Qiandubei Village, Fifth District, Huolu, and return our money. (Questioners: Wu Zhencai, Wang Yingcai, Scribe: Zhang Erxiang, Fu Shi)
      　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　To Comrades Wu Zhencai and Wang Yingcai, Zhengding County Transportation Station:
    Regarding the situation you described, there is no such regulation from above. Village cadres at all levels should earnestly help the families of martyrs to transport the remains. This is the duty of cadres. They should not extort money under false pretenses, let alone casually say that it is a regulation from above. If the families of the martyrs voluntarily give some remuneration, that is another matter.
    The Huolu Fifth District Government should investigate this matter. If it is indeed the case, the money of Wu Zhencai and Wang Yingcai should be returned, and the behavior of Li Shuangnian and Qi Yishun should be investigated and criticized.

### 起烈士灵柩不应要钱？

专栏：询问与答复

　　起烈士灵柩不应要钱？编辑同志：
    曲阳县武家湾村烈属武振才、武清科二人，到获鹿县五区前度北村，起烈士武占果灵柩，找村村长不管，中队部李双年说：你来起灵得给买二斤酒和几斤供香，烈属买了十二两酒，他们嫌少，挖的露见棺材不给挖了。李双年又叫给五万元并说这是“上级规定”，烈属只好把带的路费给了李双年五万元，致使武振才、武清科到正定就没有路费，难为的痛哭流涕。
    另有唐县五区北薄水村烈属王应才，到获鹿前度北村起烈士王继德，烈士车将出村，村长齐义顺拦住车要钱，说这是“上级规定”，动员一人一万六千元，不然走不了。烈属无奈把路费给了他二万元，说了些好话，才算完事。
    请问前度北村要我们的钱对不对？上级是否真有这样的规定？要是有这种规定，钱应谁出？要是没有这样规定，请你们转获鹿五区前度北村，把俺们的钱退还。（质问者：武振才、王应才、代笔人：张二祥、傅仕）
      　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　正定县交通站武振才、王应才同志：
    你们所说的情况，上级并没有这种规定，各级村干部应认真的帮助烈属起运灵柩，这是干部应有的义务。不应借故敲诈，更不应随便说上级规定。如烈属自愿给一些报酬，那是另外的问题。
    获鹿五区政府应调查一下，若是真实如此，应退回武振才，及王应才的钱，并追查李双年、齐义顺的行为，予以批评。
