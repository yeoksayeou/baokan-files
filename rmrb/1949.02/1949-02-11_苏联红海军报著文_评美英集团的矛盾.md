　　Soviet Red Navy Paper Publishes Article
　　Commenting on the Contradictions of the US-UK Bloc
　　【Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 9th】TASS reports: The Soviet Red Navy newspaper (formerly translated as Red Fleet News) recently published an article entitled "Sharp Contradictions in the US-UK Bloc," stating: American imperialism is striving to seize the economic wealth of "backward countries" ruled by other nations. This attempt by American monopoly capital will naturally affect the interests of its partners in the aggressive bloc, and will inevitably lead to the intensification of contradictions within the US-UK camp. Even during the Second World War, American monopoly capital took advantage of Britain's economic difficulties to seize several positions in its colonies. American exports to those colonies have increased sharply, while British exports have decreased significantly. The American intrusion into India is well-known. British newspapers have expressed extreme anxiety about the American intrusion into the Union of South Africa. Recently, Ireland's decision to break off its final ties with the British Empire has also caused considerable concern in Britain. When the American delegation proposed to conclude a treaty of friendship and a shipping agreement with Ireland, the Irish Prime Minister resolutely complied. American monopoly capital has already occupied several important positions in Britain and other Southeast Asian countries controlled by imperialism. Of all foreign investment in Indonesia, the United States accounts for 40 percent, controlling the vast majority of oil, tin, rubber, nickel, and other strategic raw materials. British Malaya, since modern times the economic and political center of British colonies in Southeast Asia, is now dominated by American capital. The same situation is forming in Siam, Burma, and other Southeast Asian countries. The competition between the US and UK for raw material resources, especially strategic resources – oil, rubber, tin, rare metals, etc. – is becoming increasingly intense. However, the contradictions existing between the US-UK bloc and their inevitable exacerbation do not preclude the possibility of their cooperation, nor their attempts to seek a way out in a path of foreign adventures, and to resolve their contradictions by sacrificing other countries.

　　苏联红海军报著文
  　评美英集团的矛盾
    【新华社陕北九日电】塔斯社讯：苏联红海军报（前译红舰队报）顷发表题为“美英集团的尖锐矛盾”一文称：美国帝国主义正力图占有在其他国家统治下的“落后国家”的经济财富。美国独占资本的这种企图，自然要影响其侵略集团中的伙伴们的利益，而且不可避免地将导向美英阵营内部矛盾的尖锐化。还在第二次大战期间，美国独占资本就利用英国的经济困难，在它的殖民地中攫得了若干阵地。美国对那些殖民地中的输出急剧增加了，而英国的输出则显著地减少了。美国之侵入印度，是众所周知的事情。英国报纸对美国侵入南非联邦的情况，表示极为焦急。最近，爱尔兰决定和大英帝国脱离最后关系，这也在英国方面引起不小的关注。当美国代表团提出与爱尔兰缔结友谊的商约与航运协定的时候，爱尔兰总理坚决地照办了。美国独占资本已在英国及其他帝国主义控制下的东南亚国家中占有若干重要阵地。美国在印尼的全部外国投资中，占有百分之四十，它控制着石油、锡、橡皮、镍及其他战略原料的巨大部分。近代以来的英属马来亚，本是英国在东南亚殖民地的经济与政治的中心，而今天，美国的资本已统治了该地。同样的，在暹罗缅甸及东南亚其他国家，这种情势也在形成中。美英在原料资源，首先最重要的是战略资源——石油、橡皮、锡，稀有金属等——的争夺上，正日益紧张。但是，现存于美英集团之间的矛盾及其不可避免地更加恶化，并不杜绝他们合作的可能性。以及他们企图在对外冒险的绝路中寻求出路，用牺牲别国来解决他们中间的矛盾的可能性。
