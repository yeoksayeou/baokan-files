[This report] To restore and develop rural production and ensure the realization of the 1949 agricultural production plan, the North China People's Government issued the 1949 agricultural loan plan on February 9th and instructed local administrative offices, provincial governments, and bank branches to study and implement it. The total amount of this agricultural loan is 564 million yuan (Renminbi). The allocation of loan areas is as follows: 64 million yuan for Chahar, 70 million yuan for Jizhong, 59 million yuan for Taihang, 27 million yuan for Taiyue, 66 million yuan for Jinan, 45 million yuan for Jilu豫, 33.5 million yuan for Jinzhong, 1.3 million yuan for Shijiazhuang, and 198.82 million yuan directly controlled by the Ministry of Agriculture. The loan nature is divided into eight categories: The allocation ratio of various loans is: waterwheels and wells account for 26.6 percent, canal digging accounts for 18 percent, animal husbandry accounts for 11.4 percent, afforestation accounts for 1.7 percent, household medicine accounts for 3.4 percent, general loans account for 25.7 percent, cotton production accounts for 4.4 percent, and state-owned farms account for 8.8 percent.

The plan specifically emphasizes that this loan must be used for agricultural production and strictly distinguished from relief funds. It must be used for specific purposes and used in accordance with the regulations of the agricultural production plan of the Agricultural Department of the North China People's Government. Under the principle of "developing production and taking into account both public and private interests," it is necessary to ensure that physical objects are preserved at cost, so that state capital can be accumulated in the development of the rural economy, so as to better support production.

It also pointed out that the number of this loan includes old loan funds, and the insufficient amount will be allocated by the head office. The loan will be issued in three phases, with one-third of the loan issued each month in February, March, and April. In order to ensure the realization of this plan, all localities should immediately stop issuing winter loans, actively clear and recover overdue old loans, and issue loans according to the new plan. In terms of specific control and issuance methods, different issuance methods should be determined according to the different loan natures: First, professional loans: must be used specifically to support dedicated production undertakings such as afforestation, animal husbandry, water conservancy, and cotton production. The bank and professional department directly sign a loan contract (such as the Water Conservancy Promotion Society, state-owned farms, Forestry and Animal Husbandry Bureau, etc.) for use or distribution by the professional department, and the professional organization formulates a production loan plan. The bank should conduct timely inspections of the production business and loan effects. In areas where there is no special organization to lead professional production, the bank or production promotion society cooperates with the agricultural and forestry departments to issue loans. Second, general agricultural and sideline loans focus on organizing the masses in disaster areas to purchase and adjust livestock, farm tools, fertilizers, seeds, and special products and other funds. This loan generally does not adopt the policy of decentralized loans to individual households, but rewards the masses who have been organized. In terms of issuance methods: in areas where there are no cooperatives, the bank or production promotion society controls the issuance and directly lends to farmers; in areas with good cooperatives, it is generally combined with the cooperative for issuance, which is conducive to the development of cooperative credit business and the control of loans, so as to achieve the purpose of lending the whole amount and repaying in installments. Regarding the loan period, the plan pointed out: (1) The general agricultural loan shall not exceed eight months. Within this period, different repayment periods shall be determined according to the production season, and the whole loan shall be repaid in installments to accelerate the turnover of the loan. The term of sideline loans is generally three to five months. (2) Professional loans should be determined specifically according to the production plan and loan purpose of each professional organization. The repayment period should generally not exceed three years, and it should be determined to repay in batches. Specifically determined: First, those who repay within one year are cotton production and agricultural medicine; second, those who repay within two years are livestock and state-owned farms; third, those who repay within three years are afforestation, waterwheels and wells, and canal digging. Regarding the issue of converting to real value and interest, the plan pointed out: (1) All loans issued shall be converted to real value, but the standard of conversion to real value should be based on the nature of the borrower's business and different physical objects should be converted. Generally speaking, the money lent to the masses is based on several major agricultural products such as rice, cotton, and oil; those lent to professional organizations, except for iron (including connecting iron) for water conservancy promotion societies, the rest of state-owned farms, forestry and animal husbandry bureaus, canal digging, agricultural medicine, etc. are all converted to rice. (2) The interest rate for agricultural loans is also divided into professional and general interest rates.

General agricultural and sideline loans and professional loans directly granted to the masses are still subject to physical loans, with a monthly interest rate of 5 to 10 per thousand. Those granted to professional organizations are calculated at the following monthly interest rates after conversion to real value: 3 per thousand for water conservancy promotion societies, 2 per thousand for state-owned farms, 2 per thousand for forestry and animal husbandry bureaus, and 3 per thousand for agricultural medicine. The instructions finally stated: Local governments should immediately study and implement the above methods.
