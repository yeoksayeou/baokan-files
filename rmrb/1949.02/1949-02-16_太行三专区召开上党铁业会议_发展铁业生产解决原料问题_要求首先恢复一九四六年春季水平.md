　　[Taihang Electric] In order to develop the iron industry production in the Shangdang area (referring to the dozen or so counties around Changzhi, southeastern Shanxi) in a planned way, and to solve the existing problems in the development of the iron industry, the Taihang Third Special District Office specially convened the Shangdang District Iron Industry Conference last December. The conference focused on solving the existing problems in the iron industry production in the area and jointly formulated a plan for future development. The Shangdang iron industry has a long history, but it was severely damaged by the Japanese invaders during the Anti-Japanese War. After liberation, we made the mistake of agricultural socialism in our work, which caused great losses to coal and iron industry production, and both quantity and quality declined significantly. The biggest problem at present is the lack of raw materials. The existing cargo furnaces in Changzhi and Huguan counties need more than 3.88 million jin of raw material iron throughout the year, but the existing raw material furnaces can only produce more than 2.7 million jin of raw material iron a year. The coal necessary for iron furnaces is also very scarce. Iron furnaces in Changzhi, Huguan, and Lingchuan counties need more than 98 million jin of coal throughout the year, but the above three counties only produce more than 54 million jin throughout the year. The second problem is the lack of technical workers, which directly affects the development of the iron industry. Many places plan to restore production, but they have failed due to the lack of technical workers. Forced production not only results in low output and poor quality, but also high costs. Based on the above situation, a production plan for 1949 was formulated, with the overall requirement of restoring to the level of the spring of 1946. First, a large number of raw material furnaces must be restored. Changzhi, Huguan, and Lingchuan counties should increase from the current 108 large and small square furnaces to 147, reaching a plan to produce more than 7 million jin of raw material iron annually. The various finished product furnaces should increase from the current 552 to 845, reaching an annual output of 6 million jin of finished products. In order to smoothly implement the plan, the conference focused on solving the following problems: 1. Continue to correct the idea of agricultural socialism and allow private individuals to operate collectively under the principle of implementing the policies of the democratic government. 2. In terms of wage policy, we must correct the egalitarian and beneficent view, and establish a correct wage policy that can reward production, improve technology. The standard of wages should be determined based on the level of technology, the simplicity and complexity of the project, the strength of labor, the size of the contribution to production, and with reference to the old wage standards before the war. In private factories, labor and management should freely negotiate to achieve a reasonable and equitable outcome. Wages should be paid in local currency, converted at local prices. 3. In terms of improving technology and reducing costs, we must carry out a movement to respect teachers and love apprentices, and correct the past incorrect understanding that "the relationship between teachers and apprentices is only an exploitative relationship." Reward apprenticeship, reward the improvement of technology, run training courses, and cultivate technical workers. After the successful trial operation of the blast furnace by the Yincheng Iron Industry Company, it should be promoted to various places. In the current situation where technology and technical workers are lacking, we should proceed from a long-term and overall perspective. We should adjust labor and technology in a planned and rational way, according to priorities and urgency. 4. In terms of raw material supply, in addition to developing a large number of raw material furnaces, Huguan, Lingchuan, and Gaoping should systematically transport raw materials to Changzhi. 5. In terms of business management, cooperatives must establish a formal management system, vigorously carry out raw material supply and finished product sales in their business, and organize labor and capital under the principles of democracy, voluntariness, and equal value to develop iron industry production. Regarding the issue of unified leadership, it was decided that the government should convene meetings from time to time to exchange experiences and reward inventors, model furnaces, and labor heroes. The main task of the county joint cooperatives and iron industry companies is to organize the purchase and sale of iron goods. The task of the trade union is to educate and organize workers to study and improve technology, and also to cooperate with the factories to run workers' welfare undertakings, such as improving political and cultural levels, improving living conditions, and protecting the legitimate democratic rights of workers. Bank loans should focus on the manufacture of raw material furnaces. The conference finally decided that each county should convene a meeting of labor, management, village cadres, and cooperatives in the iron industry development zone, combined with the local specific conditions, and in accordance with the spirit of the conference, determine the specific development, improvement plans, and various systems for the future.

　　太行三专区召开上党铁业会议
  　发展铁业生产解决原料问题     
    要求首先恢复一九四六年春季水平
    【太行电】为了有计划地发展上党（指晋东南长治周围十几县）地区铁业生产，解决铁业发展中现存问题，太行三专署特于去年十二月召开了上党区铁业会议，会中着重解决了该地区铁业生产中存在的问题，共同制定了今后发展的计划。上党铁业历史悠久，抗日战争中遭到日寇的严重摧残；解放后我们工作中又犯了农业社会主义的错误，使煤铁业生产受到了很大损失，数量质量均大大下降。目前最大的问题是原料缺乏，长治、壶关两县现有货炉全年需要原料铁三百八十八万余斤，但现有原料炉一年只可出制原料铁二百七十余万斤。在铁炉上必需的煤炭也很缺乏，长治、壶关、陵川三县铁炉全年需煤炭九千八百余万斤，但上述三县全年才产五千四百余万斤。其次一个问题是技术工人的缺乏，这直接影响了铁业的发展。不少地方计划恢复，均因技术工人的缺乏而流产。勉强生产不但产量低，质量也坏，而成本却很高。根据以上情况，制定了一九四九年生产计划，总的要求是恢复到一九四六年春季的水平。首先要大量恢复原料炉。长治、壶关、陵川三县要由现在的一百零八座大小方炉增至一百四十七座，进到年产原料铁七百余万斤的计划。各种成货炉，要由现在五百五十二座增至八百四十五座，达到全年出产成品六百万斤。为使计划顺利的贯彻，会中着重解决了以下几个问题：一、继续纠正农业社会主义思想，允许私人在执行民主政府政策的原则下集股经营。二、工资政策上要纠正平均主义的恩赐观点，建立正确的、能奖励生产的、改进提高技术的工资政策。工资的标准应以技术高低、工程简单与复杂、劳力强弱、对生产贡献的大小，并参照战前的旧工资标准来确定。在私营工厂中应由劳资双方自由订定，做到入情合理。发工资时应以当地物价折算，支付货币。三、在改进提高技术减低成本方面，要开展尊师爱徒运动，纠正过去认为“师徒关系仅是剥削关系”的不正确认识。奖励带徒弟，奖励改进提高技术，开办训练班，培养技术工人。荫城铁业公司试办的高炉成功后，要推广各地，在没技术与技术工人缺乏的当前，应从长期与整体观点出发。分别缓急、先后，有计划的合理的调整劳力与技术。四、在原料供给上，除大量发展原料炉外，壶关、陵川、高平应有计划的向长治输送原料。五、在经营管理方面，合作社必须建立正规的管理制度，业务上要大力进行原料供给与成品推销工作，并在民主自愿等价的原则下，把劳力、资金组织起来，开展铁业生产。关于统一领导问题，决定：政府在一定时期要召开会议，及时交流经验，奖励发明创造者、模范炉与劳动英雄。县联社与铁业公司的主要任务是组织铁货吞吐。职工会的任务则是教育组织工人研究提高技术，还应协同厂方举办工人福利事业，如政治文化水平的提高，生活改善，保障工人的合法民主权利等。银行贷款重点应放在制造原料炉上。会议最后决定各县在铁业发展区要召开劳方、资方、村干部、合作社会议、结合当地具体情况，依据大会精神，定出今后具体的发展、改进计划及各种制度。
