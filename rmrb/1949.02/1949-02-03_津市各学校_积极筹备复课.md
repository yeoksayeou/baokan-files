Xinhua News Agency, Tianjin, 21st—Late Dispatch: Major universities and middle schools in Tianjin, including Nankai, Beiyang, Women's Normal, and Law and Business, are actively preparing to resume classes under the leadership and assistance of the Tianjin Military Control Commission of the People's Liberation Army. On the morning of the day after the city's liberation (the 16th), the Military Control Commission's Department of Culture and Education dispatched inspectors to various schools to announce the policies of the People's Liberation Army and the democratic government on school education, and ordered the original faculty, staff, and workers to remain at their posts as usual, responsible for preparing for the reopening of schools. The Military Control Commission's Department of Culture and Education then allocated 100,000 jin of temporary relief grain, distributing it to eleven schools, including Law and Business, Jìgōng (Hebei Provincial Institute of Technology), Fisheries, Changchun University, Provincial Nanzhong, Provincial Women's Middle School, Baoding Vocational School, Northeast Third Temporary Middle School, Fourth Temporary Middle School, supplementary classes for middle school students, and Cangxian Vocational School, to temporarily solve the food problem for the faculty, staff, and students of these schools. Before the liberation of Tianjin, the Kuomintang army wantonly destroyed school facilities. They forcibly occupied the school buildings of Nankai, Beiyang, Law and Business, Jìgōng, and other schools, extensively building fortifications and constructing defenses. Over forty percent of both the North and South campuses of Nankai were burned down, and all the electrical installations in the South campus were completely destroyed; the motor in the chemistry laboratory was also looted. All the trees on the Beiyang campus were cut down, and half of the desks, chairs, and wooden beds were burned as firewood. The iron and steel plates and wire in the Jìgōng factory were also taken away to build fortifications. The damage to other schools varied. Teachers and students of Beiyang and Law and Business, among others, were forced to leave their schools and live elsewhere. In this dire situation, the teachers and students of all schools longed for the People's Liberation Army to enter the city as soon as possible. Nankai teachers and students often crowded into dormitories, secretly listening to broadcasts from the Xinhua Broadcasting Station, recording the Xinhua News Agency's New Year's message "Carry the Revolution Through to the End" word by word and passing it around. Many staff and students who remained at the schools actively organized to protect them. The Beiyang staff who remained at the school automatically organized a school protection team. The team leader, senior electrician Yu Changhai, repeatedly led the staff in firefighting work amidst intense artillery fire, inspecting circuits and repairing waterways, so that important equipment such as books and instruments could be preserved. The Law and Business staff who remained at the school also rescued many pieces of furniture amidst the hail of bullets. Nankai teachers and students organized a security committee to protect the school. More than fifty saboteurs attempted to break into the school to loot it, but were stopped by school worker Zhang Demao and others, who quickly closed the school gates, preventing the looting. On the 15th, as soon as the city was liberated, the teachers and students of Beiyang and Nankai excitedly went to the streets to welcome the People's Liberation Army, and organized propaganda teams to go to the streets to give speeches to the citizens, encouraging businesses to quickly open and resume operations.
