　　Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 8th: TASS, Pyongyang: The Second Session of the Korean Supreme People's Assembly, which opened on January 28th, concluded on February 4th. After discussing the report on the two-year economic plan by Jeong Jun-taek, Chairman of the State Planning Commission, the meeting decided to form a committee to draft the two-year economic plan bill. The meeting then heard, discussed, and approved the foreign policy report and the report on the draft election rules for people's committees at all levels.

　　In his foreign policy report, Park Heon-yeong emphasized that the continued presence of US troops in South Korea is one of the main reasons why North and South Korea have not yet been unified. The withdrawal of Soviet troops from North Korea has further helped expose the attempt of American imperialists to split Korea and turn South Korea into its colony. The Syngman Rhee reactionary clique would have ceased to exist long ago without the support of American bayonets. In discussing the foreign policy program of the Korean government, Park Heon-yeong stated that it will, as always, follow the policy of developing and consolidating close and friendly relations with the great Soviet Union, enhance relations with people's democratic countries, and continue to strive for the withdrawal of US troops from South Korea and for the unification of Korea. Park Heon-yeong concluded, "Our people will undoubtedly achieve their goal of establishing a unified and democratic country, and that time is not far away."

　　The meeting concluded with a closing speech by Premier Kim Il-sung. The Premier pointed out that due to the patriotic efforts and initiative of the Korean people, the 1948 national economic plan had been successfully completed, which further strengthened the material foundation of the Korean Republic and improved the living standards of the people. The main goal of the two-year national economic development plan is to fight for increased production. The state has allocated 1.6 billion won (Korean currency) for the expansion of arable land and the construction of hydroelectric power stations. In his closing remarks, Premier Kim Il-sung called for the organized holding of elections for local organs of power—the People's Committees.

　　朝鲜最高人民议会闭幕
  　建立统一民主的朝鲜已为期不远
    【新华社陕北八日电】塔斯社平壤讯：一月二十八日召开的朝鲜最高人民议会第二届会议，已于二月四日闭幕。会议在讨论了国家计划委员会主席郑准泽的两年经济计划报告以后，确定组成起草两年经济计划法案的委员会。会议继又听取、讨论并批准了外交政策报告和关于各级人民委员会选举规则草案的报告。
    朴宪永在其外交政策报告中强调指出：美军的继续留在南朝鲜，乃是南北朝鲜所以至今还没有统一的主要原因之一。苏军的撤出北朝鲜，更加有助于揭露美国帝国主义者分裂朝鲜并把南朝鲜变成其殖民地的企图。李承晚反动派如果没有美国刺刀的支持，早就不存在了。朴宪永在论及朝鲜政府的外交纲领时称：它将一如以往，遵循着发展及巩固与伟大的苏联之间密切及友好关系的政策，增进与人民民主国家之间的关系，继续为争取撤退南朝鲜美军与争取朝鲜统一而斗争。朴宪永结语称：“我们人民无疑将会达到其建立统一民主国家之目的，这种时候已经不远了。”
    会议最后由总理金日成致闭幕词。总理指出，由于朝鲜人民的爱国努力及积极性，一九四八年国民经济计划已顺利地完成，这就进一步地加强了朝鲜共和国的物质基础，提高了人民的生活水平。国民经济两年发展计划的主要目标，就是为增加生产而斗争。国家已拨款十六亿元（朝鲜币）供扩充耕地及建造水力发电站之需。金日成总理在结语中号召有组织地举办地方权力机关—人民委员会——的选举。
