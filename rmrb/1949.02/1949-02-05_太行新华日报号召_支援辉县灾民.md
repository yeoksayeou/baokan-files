Taihang Xinhua Daily Calls for Support for Disaster Victims in Huixian

[Taihang Electric] The Xinhua Daily here published an article calling for support for disaster victims in Huixian. It pointed out: Under the development of our nationwide victory situation, the Chiang Kai-shek bandit troops remaining in the isolated cities of Xinxiang, Huixian, and Anyang in northern Henan, led by the chief culprits Li Zhenqing and Li Chenxi, the commander and deputy commander of the Nationalist 40th Army, used unprecedentedly brutal means to loot more than 120 villages in our Huixian and parts of Xinxiang, Jixian, and Anyang, forcing tens of thousands of our people to become displaced and suffer from cold and hunger. The people and the People's Liberation Army will never forget the disasters these culprits inflicted on the people. The people who have suffered from the war will rise up to accuse Li Zhenqing, Li Chenxi, and other culprits as war criminals and will certainly capture them and bring them to justice in the upcoming battles to liberate Xinxiang and Anyang. The article called on all organs, organizations, troops, factories, schools, and people from all walks of life in the entire region to carry forward the glorious tradition of sharing weal and woe and mutual assistance and love in our region's Party, government, army, and people, to provide strong spiritual and material support to the disaster-stricken compatriots in Huixian, to relieve the 100,000 disaster victims in Huixian and the disaster victims in the border areas of Xin (xiang), Ji (xian), and An (yang), so that they can survive the winter cold and further carry out the struggle against the enemy.
