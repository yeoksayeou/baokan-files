Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, 21st. The Hongdong County Committee of the Chinese Communist Party in southern Shanxi Province has started a short-term training class for women cadres to train and promote female cadres. The training class has 196 students, mostly rural cadres and activists in the land reform movement, and a small number of students from senior primary schools. The training period is half a month and ended last month. During the training, the Hongdong County Committee of the Chinese Communist Party conveyed the CCP Central Committee's decision on current rural women's work in liberated areas last December, reviewed the women's work in various villages, and conducted education comparing the status of women in the old and new societies, which improved their political awareness. They played a significant role in the People's Liberation War, land reform movement, and production movement. Some of them carried the wounded, served as militiamen, buried stone mines, destroyed railways, carried iron rails, and made military shoes, just like men, and had countless moving deeds. Many of them also actively participated in the struggle to overthrow feudal forces and carried out production alongside men. At the end of the training, everyone was in high spirits and asked to participate in work. Thirty-one female students were assigned to work in county government departments, banks, trading companies, public security bureaus, bookstores, and other departments. Twenty-one rural women were assigned to key villages to carry out land reform and party rectification work with the help of workgroup cadres, and the rest returned to their original jobs in their villages.

　　洪洞开办妇女训练班
  　培养了大批女干部
    【新华社延安二十一日电】山西南部洪洞县中共县委开办妇女干部短期训练班，培养、提拔女干部。训练班有学员一百九十六名，大部分是农村干部、土地改革运动中的积极分子，小部分是高级小学的学生。训练时间为半个月，已于上月结束。在训练期间，中共县委传达了去年十二月中共中央关于目前解放区农村妇女工作的决定，检讨了各村的妇女工作，又进行了妇女在新旧社会中地位的对比的教育，提高了她们的政治觉悟。她们在人民解放战争中和土地改革运动、生产运动中起了重大作用。她们之中的一部分人曾经和男人一样地抬伤员，当民兵，埋石雷，破铁路，抬铁轨，作军鞋，有过无数可歌可泣的动人事迹，也有不少人曾经积极地参加了推翻封建势力的斗争，并和男人并肩地进行生产。训练结束时，大家都情绪高涨，要求参加工作。当有三十一个女学生被分配到县政府、银行、贸易公司、公安局、书店等部门工作，二十一个农村妇女被分配到工作基点村，在工作组干部帮助下进行土地改革和整党工作，其余的则仍返回本村原来的工作岗位。
