　　Artificial Rain
    The rain that falls from the sky usually isn't reliable; sometimes there's too much, sometimes too little. When it comes at the right time, it's a blessing, but when it comes at the wrong time, it's either a severe drought or a major flood. And often, it's the case that when we need rain, it doesn't come.
    If we still had superstitious thoughts, we might think this natural phenomenon is "the will of Heaven," that "Heaven doesn't pity people" and "cannot be changed." Actually, this idea is incorrect.
    For example, when there's a severe drought on the ground, and not a single drop of water, the air is still full of water. There is a lot of water vapor in the air, which can become rain and fall. When this rain falls, even the worst fields can get a foot of water.
    How can this rain be made to fall?
    According to scientists' research, as long as a large amount of dust is scattered in the air with a lot of water vapor, water droplets can definitely condense. But just having dust isn't enough to gather the water vapor. It's best if the dust carries an opposite electric charge to the water droplets in the air. When the dust with the opposite charge is scattered into the air, and the opposite electrical charges attract each other, then the water vapor can definitely be condensed into water droplets.
    People who study meteorology have tried this method many times. They first investigate how much moisture there is in the sky and what electrical charge it carries. Then, they use airplanes filled with fine sand that has been charged with the opposite electrical charge, fly into the sky, and scatter the charged fine sand into the air. Sure enough, with only seventy or eighty pounds of sand scattered in clouds several miles wide, it all condenses into large water droplets and it starts to rain in less than a minute.
    Artificial rain illustrates one point: that humans can use their intelligence and ability to harness nature and create a happier life for themselves. The saying "Man will conquer nature" is by no means empty talk.

### 人造雨

　　人造雨
    平时从天上落下来的雨，是不一定靠得住的，有时多，有时少；来得巧时，风调雨顺；来得不巧，就是一阵大旱，一阵大水。而且时常是：要雨的时候雨不来。
    如果我们还是有迷信思想的时候，会觉得这种自然现象是“天意”，是“老天爷不怜惜人”“不能改变”。其实，这种想法是不正确的。
    比方说当地上大旱，一滴水也没有的时候，空气里却充满了水，在空气里有很多水蒸气，它们是能够成为雨水落下来的。当这雨水落下来时，最坏的田也可以得到一尺来深的水了。
    这雨怎样会落下来呢？
    据科学家的研究，只要在水蒸气很多的空中，散布大量的灰尘，水滴一定可以凝结出来。但仅仅有灰尘还不能有足够的力量把水蒸气聚拢来，最好是灰尘带了和空气水滴相反的电散到空气里，发生了互相吸引的电，那么一定可以把水蒸气聚成水滴了。
    研究气象学的人，曾照着这样的方法试了很多次。他们先调查清楚了天空水分的多少，带着什么电性，然后用飞机装满了充过相反电性的细沙，飞到天上去，把带了电的细沙散在空中，果然，只用七八十斤的沙，洒在几里宽的云里，不到一分钟，都凝结成大的水滴，下起雨来了。
    从人造雨，可以说明一个问题，那就是人类可以用自己的聪明能力，利用自然，为自己创造更幸福的生活，“人定胜天”，这一句话绝不是空话。
