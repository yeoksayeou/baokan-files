【Jinzhong Electric】Workers of the Yuci Jinhua Textile Factory, amidst their intense work, are busily buying New Year's goods, preparing to joyfully celebrate their first Spring Festival after liberation. To provide for the workers' needs during the New Year, the factory advanced their wages by ten days. The factory's worker cooperative is offering preferential treatment to each worker, allowing them to buy five yards of cloth (fourteen feet) at the factory's wholesale price, and purchase necessities such as white flour, sesame oil, and flaxseed oil from the cooperative at 95% of the market price. According to Xu Cunying, wife of worker Liu Yi, and the family members of Shi Yuhe and Zhang Zhen, workers in the Kuomintang controlled areas had to sell clothes in the market every day before the New Year. Last year, Xu Cunying's family ate less than half a bowl of rice and a handful of mung beans and broad beans for the entire New Year. This year, they have prepared 50 jin of white flour, 20 jin of rice, 45 jin of cabbage, 5 jin of meat, and 4 jin of vermicelli. They spent more than 400 yuan just to buy New Year's items for the children. Her nine-year-old daughter, Dachun, is excited to wear new clothes for the New Year. Last year, Zhang Zhen's family ate sorghum for one meal during the New Year, and continued to eat bean cakes and cattail roots, leaving everyone bloated. This year, they have prepared 5 jin of meat, 33 jin of white flour, 50 jin of cabbage, and 2 jin of vermicelli. Apprentice Wang Haisan's mother said, "If the People's Liberation Army hadn't come, we would have starved to death long ago. How could we have such a happy life now!" Workers and staff all reflected, "Last year and this year are completely different, truly one in hell and one in heaven (referring to after liberation)."

　　榆次晋华工厂职工
  　欢渡解放后第一个春节
    【晋中电】榆次晋华纺织厂职工于紧张工作之余，纷纷购买过年东西，准备欢渡解放后的第一个春节。厂方为供给职工过年需要，提前十天发工资。该厂职工合作社，特优待每个职工，按厂方批发价格买五码布（一丈四尺），按市价九五折，从合作社购白面、香油、麻油等需用品。据工人刘毅的女人徐存英和师玉和、张珍等家属谈：去年在阎匪统治时，工人过年前，天天到市上卖衣服。徐存英全家去年过年只吃了不到半碗大米和一把绿豆和扁豆，今年便准备好五十斤白面、二十斤大米、四十五斤白菜、五斤肉、四斤粉条，仅给小孩子买过年的东西就用去四百余元。其九岁的女孩大春，高兴的要过年穿新衣。张珍全家去年过年除吃一顿高粱外，仍旧吃着豆饼和蒲草根，每个人都满身浮肿；今年也准备了五斤肉、三十三斤白面、五十斤白菜、二斤粉条。学徒王海三的母亲说：“若不是解放军过来，早就饿死了，那还有现在幸福的生活！”工人和职员们都反映说：“去年和今年可大不相同，真是一在地狱一在天堂（指解放后）”。
