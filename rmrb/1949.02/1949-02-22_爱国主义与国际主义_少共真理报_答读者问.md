    Editor's Note: Since Comrade Liu Shaoqi's discussion of internationalism and nationalism was published, many readers have written to request reference materials. We are introducing this article specifically for that purpose.
  　　　　　　　　　　　
    Comrade Velesov (Tambov Province) asks: How should we understand the combination of patriotism and internationalism of the Soviet people and the people of all nationalities in the New Democratic countries?
    The great October Socialist Revolution opened a new period in the development of mankind, a period of complete liberation of the working people from the shackles of the exploiters. The transfer of state power into the hands of workers and peasants is the greatest qualitative leap in social development, and this leap has brought profound changes to the material and spiritual lives of the working people.
    One of the essential manifestations of the fundamentally changed spiritual life of all nationalities after the revolution is the attitude of the working masses toward their motherland.
    In Tsarist Russia, the people's love for their homeland, their culture, and their traditions was combined with a strong hatred for the savage order established by the oppressors and exploiters in the country. The landlords and capitalists, basely exploiting the patriotic feelings of the workers and peasants, tried to poison the masses with nationalism and preached reconciliation of class contradictions in the interests of so-called "national unity." Russian revolutionary democrats fought against nationalism. They understood how much damage nationalism had done to the people's liberation movement. However, a truly broad and principled struggle against this evil only unfolded when the proletariat—itself a class of natural internationalists—took the stage of history. Before the proletariat appeared, there was not and could not be true internationalism. Previously, the revolutionary movement of the oppressed classes did not go beyond the scope of nationalism, and the international relations of the oppressing classes never had anything in common with internationalism, because their basic idea was, and still is, the plunder and enslavement of other countries and other nations, rather than the idea of equality and mutual assistance among nations. The old world only knew one means of "uniting" nations—aggression, which, of course, could never unite them; it could only provoke national liberation movements and cause this complex "union," divided by internal contradictions, to disintegrate.
    The proletariat has its own completely new understanding of patriotism. Lenin summarized patriotism with particular care and completeness in his essay "On the National Pride of the Great Russians." Lenin pointed out that the proletariat loves its motherland, sacredly respects its revolutionary traditions, and fights selflessly to liberate its motherland from the exploiters. Lenin taught: "The interests of the national pride of the Great Russians (not the kind of pride that slaves have) coincide with the socialist interests of the proletarians of the Great Russians (and of all other nations)." (Lenin's Collected Works, Vol. 18, p. 83) This revolutionary understanding of patriotism guides the masses to fight first against "their own" oppressors and to unite with the working people of all nations and all countries. For the first time in history, patriotism is combined with internationalism and becomes truly thorough revolutionary patriotism.
    The bourgeoisie desperately propagates—and international Menshevism helps it in this regard—its own method of seeking national "liberation" from national oppression—the method of bourgeois nationalism, which strengthens national hatred among the working people of different nations. The result of this method is to strengthen the positions of the bourgeoisie in various countries, subject the working people to even heavier taxation and slavery, and weaken the international solidarity of the working people. Inciting one nation against another and oppressing minority nationalities is the national policy of the bourgeoisie.
    The October Revolution, with the proletarian internationalist method, with the means of establishing a fraternal alliance of workers and peasants of different nationalities, liberated all oppressed nationalities and laid the foundation for a new attitude of the working people toward their socialist motherland. The working people of all nationalities in our motherland look with love at the Soviet state and at its leading nationality—the Russian people; their national interests are integrated with the common interests of all Soviet people and with the interests of building communism.
    Only the socialist revolution was able to save our country from the military and economic ruin caused by the landlord and bourgeois rulers. Only the revolution was able to prevent our motherland from losing its national independence and being completely conquered by foreign imperialism. The task of reviving the economy of a country devastated by two wars was beyond the ability of any bourgeois government. However, what the bourgeoisie is incapable of doing can be realized when state power is in the hands of the working people. Comrade Stalin said: The unprecedented growth of Soviet production should not be regarded as a simple and ordinary development of a country from backwardness to progress. This is a leap, a leap that has been achieved entirely by means of socialist economic management methods and the Soviet policy of national industrialization and rural collectivization. It is precisely the socialist social system that has made it possible to establish such material wealth in the shortest period of time, on which our people relied to defend their national independence in the Great Patriotic War and to liberate many European nations from fascist enslavement. Therefore, the Soviet working people believe that our country's policies are their own policies, and our country's military, economic, and diplomatic victories are the common victories of the people. Our national pride is the pride that the working people feel because of their socialist country.
    Capitalism has led culture to bankruptcy and decadence, and mankind has long faced such a choice due to the course of historical development: "Either sacrifice all culture, or shake off the shackles of capitalism by revolutionary means, eliminate the rule of the bourgeoisie, and strive for a socialist society and lasting peace." (Lenin's Collected Works, Vol. 22, p. 145) Only the Soviet regime has given the formerly oppressed and declining nationalities the possibility of developing their own cultures and the possibility of reviving and developing as independent nations.
    The liberated nationalities voluntarily unite in a fraternal family. The world recognizes a new method of true unity among nationalities based on equality, friendship, and unity of purpose and interests. In this case, the old, disgusting nationalism is the most dangerous remnant of capitalism in people's consciousness, because nationalism will alienate the nationalities and weaken the friendship between them, so it is incompatible with the true patriotism of the working masses.
    The Bolshevik Party, taking into account that "the remnants of capitalism in people's consciousness are far more vigorous in the national question than in any other aspect" (Stalin), has consistently waged a relentless struggle against nationalism. In our country, manifestations of nationalism are subject to legal sanctions. The Soviet regime and the Bolshevik Party have educated our people with a new patriotism that is permeated with the spirit of internationalism. Comrade Stalin said: "Soviet patriotism does not divide, on the contrary, it unites all the nationalities of our country into a unified fraternal family... At the same time, the people of all nationalities in the Soviet Union respect the rights and independence of the people of all foreign nationalities..." Soviet patriotism is vividly manifested in the friendship of all nationalities joining the Soviet Federation, in the fraternal assistance of one republic to another, and in the prosperity of national cultures.
    A new type of patriotism is emerging and consolidating in the People's Democratic countries where the working people have seized power.
    The people of all nationalities in the New Democratic countries, having broken the shackles of the exploiters, established people's states, and united around the Communist Parties of various countries under the banner of socialism, see and realize that the success of socialist construction is the highest expression of their national interests. The implementation of national economic plans, enthusiastic labor, and the rapid development of national cultures—all these are manifestations of the new patriotism of the working people in the People's Democratic countries. This patriotism is combined with proletarian internationalism. The national liberation wars waged by the people of all nationalities in the New Democratic countries against German fascism, the struggle currently being waged by the people of all nationalities in the New Democratic countries against the imperialist camp and its lackeys, and the experience of socialist construction have made the people of these countries clearly realize that only the close assistance of all nationalities can win victory, and the strong support and assistance of the Soviet Union is the decisive factor in winning victory. From this comes the close friendship between the people of all nationalities in the New Democratic countries and between these countries and the Soviet Union. From this comes the love of the working people of these countries for the Soviet Union, for this country that thoroughly and completely embodies the principles of socialism in life.
    Internationalism—which is far from any manifestation of national hatred—is an indispensable component of the new patriotism and greatly infuriates the enemies of the working people. The propagandists of the bourgeoisie, in the unity of the notorious "Pan-Europa" lackey plan, are reviving the old dream of nationalism. They want to replace patriotism with nationalism and internationalism with cosmopolitanism. They—the nationalists, for them, the Anglo-Saxon race is above all! They—the cosmopolitans, their propagandists declare: Down with national sovereignty! Abolish all national borders for the freedom of action of American military police and company salesmen!
    The working people know that nationalism and cosmopolitanism are two sides of the same imperialist coin. There is no difference in essence between nationalists who despise other nationalities and cosmopolitans who despise their own nationalities in order to please American imperialists.
    The despicable nationalistic practice of the Social Democrats is precisely the base on which the poisonous propaganda of fascism can grow. As early as 1915, Lenin wrote: "The ideological, political, and inherent connection, relationship, and similarity between opportunism and social-nationalism are beyond doubt." These accusations strike right at today's right-wing Social Democrats, the fascist revivers who are trying to block the victorious movement of all nationalities towards socialism.
    Neither Soviet patriotism nor the patriotism of the working people of the New Democratic countries is conceivable without internationalism. The patriotism of all nationalities building a socialist society is a new patriotism in history that has not been seen before by the masses who have seized power. Therefore, the imperialists hate and fear it so much, and therefore, they try to sow distrust among the nationalities by all means, try to poison the nationalities with the poison of nationalism, and try to split the international solidarity of the working people.

　　爱国主义与国际主义
    ——少共真理报“答读者问”
    斯卡特谢科夫
    编者按：自刘少奇同志论国际主义与民族主义发表后，曾有不少读者来函要求提供参考材料，兹特介绍此文。
  　　　　　　　　　　　
    维列索夫同志（唐波夫省）问：我们应当怎样理解：苏联人民与新民主主义国家各族人民的爱国主义与国际主义的结合？
    伟大的十月社会主义革命，在人类的发展上展开了一个新时期，一个劳动人民由剥削者的枷锁中完全解放出来的时期。政权之转入工农手中，乃是社会发展中最伟大的质的飞跃，这一飞跃给劳动人民的物质生活与精神生活带来了深刻变化。
    在革命后起了根本变化的各民族精神生活的本质的表现之一，就是劳动群众对于自己的祖国的态度。
    在沙皇俄国，人民对祖国土地、祖国文化及其传统的喜爱，曾是与对压迫者、对剥削者在国内所建立的野蛮秩序的强烈仇视结合着的。地主与资本家们，卑鄙地利用工农的爱国感情，曾力图以民族主义来毒化群众，而在所谓“民族统一”的利益下宣传着调和阶级矛盾的说教。俄国革命的民主主义者，就曾经进行了反对民族主义的斗争。他们了解：民族主义曾给民众的解放运动带来如何巨大的毒害。然而和这个毒恶东西进行真正广泛的具有原则性的斗争，则只是从无产阶级——它本身就是天生的国际主义的阶级——走上历史舞台的时候才展开的。在无产阶级出现以前，没有过而且也不可能有过真正的国际主义。以前，被压迫阶级的革命运动没有越出民族主义的范围，而压迫阶级的国际关系，则从来与国际主义未曾有过任何共同之点，因为他们的基本思想，就曾经是而且现在也是掠夺和奴役别的国家与别的民族，而不是各民族平权互助的思想。旧世界只知道一个“结合”各民族的手段——侵略，当然，这是任何时候也不能把他们结合起来的，它只能引起民族解放运动，并使这种由于内部矛盾而分崩离析的，成份复杂的“结合”趋于瓦解。
    无产阶级对于爱国主义有自己的完全新的理解。列宁曾把爱国主义特别缜密而完整地归纳在他的论文“论大俄罗斯人的民族自傲心”里。列宁指出：无产阶级挚爱自己的祖国，神圣地尊崇着祖国的革命传统，奋不顾身地进行着从剥削者手中解放祖国的斗争。列宁教导说：“大俄罗斯人民族自傲精神（不是奴仆心目中的那种自傲精神）利益与大俄罗斯人（以及其他一切民族）无产者的社会主义利益相合。”（列宁全集、第十八卷、八三页）这种对于爱国主义的革命的理解，就引导群众首先去和“自己的”压迫者斗争，去和一切民族、一切国家的劳动人民团结。爱国主义在历史上破天荒第一次和国际主义结合起来，并成为真正彻底的革命的爱国主义。
    资产阶级拼命宣传——而国际孟什维主义在这点上又帮助了它——自己的由民族压迫中求得民族“解放”的方法——资产阶级民族主义的方法，加强不同民族的劳动人民之间的民族仇视。这种方法，其结果就是加强各国资产阶级的阵地和使劳动人民更加受到苛税的奴役，削弱劳动人民的国际团结。唆使这一个民族反对另一个民族，压迫少数民族，这就是资产阶级的民族政策。
    十月革命以无产阶级的国际主义方法，以建立不同民族工农的兄弟联盟手段，解放了各被压迫民族，而奠定了劳动人民对于自己的社会主义祖国之新态度的基础，我们祖国的一切民族的劳动人民，都以热爱注视着苏维埃国家，注视着它的领导民族——俄罗斯人民；他们的民族利益，是和所有苏联人民的共同利益，是和建设共产主义的利益融合在一起的。
    曾只有社会主义革命，才能够从地主资产阶级统治者所造成的军事破灭，经济破灭中挽救了我国。曾只有革命，才能够避免了我们祖国失去民族独立而为外国帝国主义所完全征服。遭到两次战争破坏的国家的经济复兴任务，是任何一个资产阶级政府所无能为力的。然而，资产阶级无能力的事情，当政权掌握在劳动人民手中的时候，却可以付诸实现。斯大林同志说：苏联生产之空前增长，不可认为这是国家由落后走向进步的简单、普通的发展。这是飞跃，是完全借助于社会主义的经济管理方法，借助于国家工业化与农村集体化的苏维埃政策才实现的飞跃。正是社会主义的社会制度，才能使得在最短期间内建立了这样的物质财源，我国人民依靠这个财源，在伟大卫国战争中维护了自己的民族独立，并从法西斯奴役下解放了许多欧洲民族。因此，苏联劳动人民认为我国的政策就是自己的政策，我国军事上、经济上、外交上的胜利，就是人民共同的胜利。我们的民族自傲心，乃是劳动人民由于自己的社会主义国家而感到的自傲心。
    资本主义把文化引向了破产和颓废，而人类由于历史发展进程早就面临这样的选择了：“或是牺牲一切文化，或是以革命手段甩脱资本主义的枷锁，铲除资产阶级的统治，争取社会主义社会与持久的和平。”（列宁全集、第二十二卷、一四五页）只有苏维埃政权才给予了过去曾被压迫的和曾走向衰亡的民族以发展自己文化的可能，象一个独立民族那样复兴和发展的可能。
    被解放了的各民族，自愿地结合在一个亲如兄弟的大家庭里。世界认识了一种在平权、友爱、任务与利益一致的基础上，各民族真正团结的新方法。在这种情况下，陈旧的令人作呕的民族主义，就是人们意识中最危险的资本主义残余，因为民族主义将离间各民族，削弱他们之间的友谊，因此它与劳动群众真正的爱国主义是不能相容的。
    布尔什维克党考虑到“人们意识中的资本主义残余，在民族问题方面，远比在其他任何方面更富有生命力”（斯大林），经常对民族主义进行了无情的斗争。在我国，民族主义的表现，是要受到法律制裁的。苏维埃政权、布尔什维克党以贯穿着国际主义精神的新爱国主义，教育了我国人民，斯大林同志说：“苏维埃爱国主义，不是分裂，相反，而是团结我国的所有民族成为一个统一的兄弟家庭……。同时，苏联各族人民尊重外国各族人民的权利与独立……。”苏维埃爱国主义，在所有加入苏维埃联邦的各民族的友爱上，在这一个共和国对另一个共和国的兄弟之谊的帮助上，在民族文化的繁荣上，都得到了鲜明的表现。
    新型的爱国主义，在劳动人民取得政权的人民民主国家中产生着和巩固着。
    新民主主义国家的各民族，打碎了剥削者的枷锁，建立了人民的国家，在社会主义旗帜下团结在各国共产党的周围，他们看到并觉悟到：社会主义建设的成功，就是他们民族利益的最高表现。执行国家的国民经济计划，热情的劳动，民族文化的急激发展——所有这些都是人民民主国家劳动人民的新爱国主义的表现。这种爱国主义是与无产阶级的国际主义结合着的。新民主主义国家各民族曾经进行的反对德国法西斯主义的民族解放战争，新民主主义国家各民族现在尚在进行着的反对帝国主义阵营及其走狗的斗争，以及社会主义建设的经验，使这些国家的民众明确地认识到：只有各民族的紧密协助才能赢得胜利，苏联的强有力的支援与帮助，乃是赢得胜利的决定因素。由此而来的，是新民主主义国家各民族互相之间，与苏联之间的密切友谊。由此而来的，是这些国家劳动人民对于苏联，对于这一在生活中彻底、完全体现了社会主义原则的国家的热爱。
    与任何民族仇视的表现都相去甚远的国际主义——它是新爱国主义不可毁弃的构成部分——使劳动人民的敌人大为激怒。资产阶级的宣传家们，在著名的“泛欧罗巴”奴才计划的统一中，正在复活着陈旧的民族主义的梦幻。他们想以民族主义代替爱国主义，想以世界主义代替国际主义。他们——民族主义者，对于他们来说，盎格鲁、撒克迩种族就高于一切！他们——世界主义者，他们的宣传家宣布说：打倒民族主权！为了美国宪兵与公司推销员的行动自由，取消一切国界！
    劳动人民知道，民族主义与世界主义，这是一个帝国主义牌子的两面，贱视其他民族的民族主义者，与为了取悦于美帝国主义者而贱视自己民族的世界主义者，在本质上并无不同之处。
    社会民主党卑劣的民族主义的实践，恰好是法西斯的毒恶宣传得以成长的基地。列宁远在一九一五年就曾写道：“机会主义与社会民族主义，在思想上、政治上的血肉关系、联系，以及相同，是毫无疑问的。”这些指责的话，正打中着今天的右派社会党人，妄图阻挡各民族走向社会主义的胜利运动的法西斯主义复兴者。
    无论是苏维埃爱国主义，或是新民主主义国家劳动人民的爱国主义，没有国际主义，都是不可想象的。建设社会主义社会的各民族的爱国主义，是取得政权群众的在历史上尚未见过的新爱国主义。因此，帝国主义者是如此仇视它与惧怕它，因此，他们力图以一切手段在各民族之间撒布不信任，力图以民族主义的毒药来毒害各民族，力图分裂劳动人民的国际团结。
