[He-Lu-Yu Electric Dispatch] Regarding how to continue carrying out land reform work in the vast newly recovered areas south of the Yellow River, the CCP He-Lu-Yu District Committee issued special instructions a few days ago. The instructions first pointed out: Since the Su-Qi Campaign last year, the vast area south of the Yellow River has been liberated. After the Huai-Hai Campaign, Xuzhou was liberated, and the situation was completely stabilized. The broad masses of farmers had already carried out land reform struggles before Chiang Kai-shek's bandits occupied the area. They have already had the consciousness and training to thoroughly overthrow feudalism. Therefore, in the face of the new situation, it is entirely possible and necessary to lead farmers in carrying out land reform. The instructions then put forward general opinions based on the struggle currently led by the Party in the south of the Yellow River: The work of suppressing traitors and handling "counter-settlements" should not be distinctly divided into a stage to be carried out, but should be regarded as a component of land reform. The instructions made the following analysis of the situation south of the Yellow River: In the two years of the Liberation War, the area south of the Yellow River has often been in a back-and-forth situation of constant advance and retreat by the enemy. Certain bad elements of the landlord class have relied on Chiang Kai-shek's bandits to carry out revenge and counter-settlements, raping, killing...and insulting farmers in every possible way. The broad masses of farmers have suffered deeply. It is necessary for local party committees to launch the broad masses of farmers to deal with some of the bad landlord elements who have carried out "counter-settlements" and acted unreasonably. But what is the problem now? The instructions believe that many cadres regard mobilizing the masses to speak out about their suffering and resolving the "counter-settlement" issue as the only thing, and even specifically designate it as a stage to be carried out as the center of the movement, which is wrong. The instructions pointed out that there are currently two situations that must be changed: The first is the situation of the Fifth District Committee (including Dongming, Cao County, and other places): from the perspective of leadership ideology and organizational strength, it is centered on suppressing traitors and handling the counter-settlement issue, combined with restoring mass organizations to carry out a movement, but the working policy after the counter-settlement is not clear enough. The second is the situation of the Second, Third, and Seventh District Committees (including Jining, Ju County, and other places), where the leadership ideology has clarified that the task is to suppress traitors and handle the "counter-settlement" issue to lay the foundation for completing land reform. The Third District Committee also conducted key village surveys in Feng and Pei Counties, affirming this policy, but in specific implementation, the specific content of organizing farmers' struggles is still centered on speaking out about suffering, suppressing traitors, and handling "counter-settlements," while the leadership in how to implement and end land reform work is relatively neglected. The District Committee believes that the above two practices are very inappropriate, and pointed out: If handling "counter-settlements" is regarded as a stage, or if one starts from the very beginning and fixes on suppressing traitors and handling the "counter-settlement" issue, it will inevitably lead to a situation where the movement to suppress traitors and speak out about suffering replaces the land reform movement. The development of the movement will relax the effort to meet the land demands of the majority of farmers. Regarding how to grasp the handling of "counter-settlements" and the suppression of traitors while simultaneously carrying out land reform in the future, the District Committee clearly pointed out in the instructions: In the land reform struggle to thoroughly eliminate the feudal exploitation system, it is entirely reasonable for farmers to demand the handling of landlords' "counter-settlement" behavior. "Counter-settlement" is an illegal behavior, which is also very clear in our policy guidelines, but in specifically leading and resolving this issue, it must be differentiated: it is necessary to distinguish between the primary and the coerced, to distinguish between large, medium, and small landlords, and it is even more important to pay special attention to the fact that the "counter-settlement" behavior of some injured middle peasants should be treated as an internal problem of the peasants. In the leadership of the movement, it is necessary to resolutely rely on poor peasants and farm laborers, consolidate the alliance with middle peasants; it is necessary to pay attention to the policy of giving landlords a share and leaving rich peasants a share. That is to say, handling the "counter-settlement" issue in the land reform movement must be led, step by step, and must be based on the Party's general line and general policy. In short, the "counter-settlement" issue must be handled in the process of completing land reform. The method of centering on the movement to handle "counter-settlements" and suppress traitors and speak out about suffering, or regarding it as a stage, must be changed. On the steps to be taken, the District Committee pointed out: First train cadres, explain the land reform policy, divide them into work groups, and conduct in-depth investigations based on different situations, understand the situation, discover activists and better elements, and combine the specific demands of the local masses to conduct extensive policy and current affairs propaganda among the masses. In terms of methods, the focus should be on promoting the general, rather than a massive and reckless campaign. Only by proceeding in this step-by-step and meticulous manner can we truly meet the land reform demands of the broad masses of farmers.

　　冀鲁豫区党委指示收复区工作方针
    满足广大农民要求
    坚决贯彻土地改革
    处理“倒算”问题不应成为运动的中心
    【冀鲁豫电】关于黄河南广大新收复区的土地改革工作如何继续开展的问题，冀鲁豫区党委特于日前发出专门指示。指示中首先指出：自去年睢杞战役后，黄河以南广大地区即获解放。淮海战役后，徐州解放，局面完全稳定，广大农民在蒋匪进占该地前，早已进行过土地改革斗争，对于消灭封建彻底翻身是已有过觉悟与锻炼的，因此，在新的形势面前，领导农民进行土地改革是完全可能而且必需的。指示继根据目前黄河南党所领导农民进行的斗争提出总的意见称：不应把反奸和处理“倒算”问题截然划作一个阶段去进行，而应该把它当作土地改革的一个内容。指示中对于黄河南的情况作了如下分析：两年来的解放战争中，黄河南经常处于敌人的不断前进与后退的拉锯局面中，地主阶级中的某些坏分子曾依靠蒋匪，进行报复倒算，奸淫、杀人……对农民百般侮辱，广大农民身受其苦，各地党委依此情况，发动广大农民处理一些进行“倒算”、无理作恶的坏蛋地主是必需的。但目前的问题在哪里呢？指示中认为：许多干部把发动群众诉苦解决“倒算”问题看作是唯一的，甚至把它专划做一阶段当作运动的中心去进行则是错误的。指示中指出目前有两种情况，必须改变；第一种是五地委（包括东明、曹县等地）的情况：从领导思想与组织力量上，就是以反奸与处理倒算问题为中心，结合恢复群众组织去开展一个运动，而对反倒算以后的工作方针，则不够明确。第二种是二、三、七地委（包括济宁、巨野等地）的情况，领导思想上是明确了以反奸及处理“倒算”问题去打下完成土地改革的基础。三地委并在丰、沛两县作过重点村调查，肯定了这一方针，但在具体执行中，在组织农民斗争的具体内容上，却仍以诉苦、反奸、处理“倒算”为中心，而在如何贯彻与结束土地改革工作的领导上，则比较忽视。区党委认为以上两种作法都是十分不妥当的，并指出：如果以处理“倒算”当作一个阶段，或一开始即固定的从反奸与处理“倒算”问题做起，则势必形成反奸诉苦运动代替土地改革运动的情况。运动的发展，将会放松了去满足更多数农民的土地要求。关于今后应如何掌握处理“倒算”及反奸并同时进行土地改革的问题，区党委于指示中明确指出：在进行彻底消灭封建剥削制度的土地改革斗争中，农民要求处理地主的“倒算”行为，是十分合理的，“倒算”是一种违法的行为，这在我们的政策方针上亦是十分明确的，但在具体领导与解决这一问题时，必须是有分别的：要区别首要与胁从，要区别大、中、小地主，更要特别注意的是有一部分被伤害了的中农的“倒算”行为是应当当作农民的内部问题去处理的。在运动的领导上必须是坚决依靠贫雇农、巩固地联合中农；必须注意地主分一份，富农留一份的政策。这就是说在土地改革运动中去处理“倒算”问题，必须是有领导、有步骤，必须是以党的总路线总政策作依据的。总之，必须是在完成土地改革中去处理“倒算”问题，那种以处理“倒算”及反奸诉苦运动为中心，或当作一段的办法必须改变。在进行的步骤上，区党委指出：首先训练干部，讲明土地改革政策，分成工作组，要分别不同情况，进行深入调查，了解情况，发现积极分子与较好分子，结合当地群众的具体要求，对群众进行广泛的政策与时事宣传。在方式上，应采取重点推动一般，而不是大轰大干，只有这样有步骤的，细致的去进行，才能真正满足广大农民的土地改革要求。
