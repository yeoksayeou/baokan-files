Xinhua News Agency, Beiping, 18th: The Beiping Military Control Commission is actively carrying out the work of sheltering stragglers and vagrant soldiers of the Kuomintang army. Kuomintang army organs and personnel scattered in the city are, in accordance with the regulations of the Military Control Commission, carrying weapons, radios, documents, etc. to the Straggling Soldiers Handling Committee to register. From February 3rd to 8th, in six days, 1,494 people reported to the general office and three branch offices, and twelve district shelters of the committee. This included a Major General Senior Staff Officer of the pseudo "North China剿总 (剿匪總司令部 - Bandit Suppression Headquarters)", a Major General Instructor of the pseudo Central Military Academy First Branch School, and four Japanese prisoners of war left by the war criminal Yan Xishan to massacre the Chinese people. Most of the registered personnel have been sent by the Military Control Commission to study outside the city. Under the inspiration of the people's government's lenient policy, since February 9th, the number of registered stragglers has increased daily. By noon on the 11th, in two and a half days, the general office directly under the shelter alone had more than 220 people go to register. Because Beiping was the largest reactionary fortress of the Kuomintang reactionaries in North China before liberation, and this time it was liberated peacefully, it has added many difficulties to the work of sheltering stragglers and vagrant soldiers. Before liberation, various departments of the Kuomintang army set up many garrison offices in the city, some of which belonged to the Kuomintang army that had been eliminated, some belonged to those being encircled and annihilated, such as Yan Xishan's troops, and some belonged to those who were willing to accept the eight peace conditions of the Chinese Communist Party and leave the city to await reorganization. In addition, there were a large number of wounded Kuomintang soldiers who had collapsed from the front lines. Most of these scattered troops, organs, and personnel had weapons. Some of them had families in the city, some had no home to return to, and some had even changed into civilian clothes. This caused serious problems in public security work. In the days before and after liberation, several robberies occurred in the city, some of which were committed by stragglers. The Beiping Municipal Straggling Soldiers Handling Committee adopted different guidelines and methods for different objects when carrying out the work of sheltering Kuomintang stragglers. The committee stipulates that all the garrison organs and personnel of the original Kuomintang army who accept reorganization are limited to reporting and registering before February 10th, and those who fail to do so will be treated as straggling soldiers; all Kuomintang army organs and personnel in Ping who are still stubbornly resisting must truthfully register weapons, ammunition, and documents, submit a detailed list, and wait for processing; all Kuomintang army organs and personnel in Ping who have been eliminated from the establishment will be treated as straggling soldiers. The committee will arrest the most heinous ringleaders and a small number of stubborn elements who have not reported overdue and have committed many evils and are hated by the masses. For general personnel, it will order them to report through various relationships, and grasp the original person in charge to assemble the personnel and weapons of the department.

Xinhua News Agency, Tianjin, 18th: The Tianjin Garrison Command was officially established on the 13th by order of the Pingjin Front Command of the Chinese People's Liberation Army. Xiao Jingguang was appointed commander of the garrison, Huang Kecheng concurrently served as political commissar, Chen Boling and Zhong Wei were deputy commanders, and Yuan Shengping was deputy political commissar.

　　北平收容国民党军散兵
  　六天登记千五百名
    天津警备司令部成立
    【新华社北平十八日电】北平市军管会正在积极展开收容国民党军的散兵游勇工作。流散在市内的国民党军机关及人员，正遵照军事管制委员会的规定，纷纷携带武器、电台、证件等前往流散军人处理委员会登记。自二月三日至八日的六天内，到该会总会及三个分会、十二个区收容所报到的，即有一千四百九十四人，其中包括伪“华北剿总”少将高级参谋、伪中央军官学校第一分校少将教官及被战犯阎锡山留用来屠杀中国人民的日本战俘四人。已登记人员，大部已由军管会集中送往城外学习。在人民政府宽大政策的感召下，自二月九日起，流散人员的登记人数日增，迄十一日中午止，在二天半的时间内，仅总会直属收容所一处即有二百二十余人前往登记。由于北平在解放前是国民党反动派在华北最大的反动堡垒，此次又是以和平方式解放的，因此在收容散兵游勇工作中，增加了许多困难。解放前，国民党军各部在市内设立许多留守处，其中有属于已被消灭的国民党军者，有属于正被围歼的如阎锡山所部者，有属于这次愿意接受中国共产党的八项和平条件出城听候改编者。此外还有大量从前线上溃败下来的国民党军伤兵。在这些流散部队、机关、人员中，大部均有武器。其中有的有家室在市内，有的则已无家可归，有的甚至已经换了便衣。这造成了治安工作中的严重问题。解放前后的几天内，在市内发生的抢案中，有几件就是散兵干的。北平市流散军人处理委员会，在进行收容国民党散兵工作时，按照不同对象，采用了不同的方针和办法。该会规定，凡接受改编的原国民党军留守机关和人员，统限于二月十日前报到登记，逾期者按流散军人处理；凡现在仍在负隅顽抗的国民党军在平机关、人员，须切实将武器、弹药、证件，造具清册，报到呈缴，等候处理；凡已被消灭建制的国民党军在平机关、人员，均按流散军人处理。该会对罪大恶极的首犯以及逾期不报到的作恶多端的为群众所痛恨的少数顽固分子，予以逮捕，对一般人员则通过各种关系令其报到，并掌握原来的负责人去集合所部人员及武器。
    【新华社天津十八日电】天津市警备司令部业于十三日奉中国人民解放军平津前线司令部命令正式成立，由萧劲光任警备司令，黄克诚兼政治委员，陈伯铃、钟伟为副司令，袁升平为副政治委员。
