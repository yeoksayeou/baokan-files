　　The Postal Service of Hebei-Shandong-Henan in the Past Three Years
    Ji Lu Yu Branch
    April 1, 1946, was the day when the wartime transportation bureau, built by Hebei-Shandong-Henan during the Anti-Japanese War, was changed to the postal bureau. From then on, the post office implemented the policy of enterprise and began to implement the stamp system. However, less than three months after the birth of this people's post office, Chiang Kai-shek's bandit army launched a large-scale offensive against the border area. Under the slogan of "everything serves the front," our people's post office quickly turned into a wartime post office. After the Longhai Campaign began, eighty postal workers were transferred within three days to organize × military post offices, which followed the Liu-Deng army and assumed the task of connecting the front and rear. Before the establishment of the military post office, it took half a month for the reporter group's manuscripts to be sent from the front to the newspaper office. After the establishment of the military post office, it only took one to two days, and no more than three days at the latest; newspapers could be seen on the 300-li-long Henan North front in three days. Postal workers, regardless of day and night, braved wind and rain, and enemy aircraft strafing, running day and night, walking more than 100 li every day. On the Henan North front, military postal workers Song Youfa, Jiang Fengxian, Chen Jianping, and others even annihilated an enemy force while delivering mail, capturing six enemies, seizing two machine guns, three rifles, and six hundred rounds of ammunition. According to incomplete statistics: the number of military mails delivered with honorary free treatment was 36,600 in 1947. In the second half of 1948 alone, 41,330 pieces were received and sent in the thirty counties north of the Yellow River, guaranteeing the supply of political and cultural nourishment for the front-line troops. Soldiers on the battlefield could often see newspapers and news of their families turning over a new leaf, which encouraged the soldiers' fighting spirit and powerfully supported the war.
    After Chiang Kai-shek's bandit army occupied the area south of the Yellow River, our Fifth Sub-bureau Director personally led three armed transportation squads and persisted in wartime postal contact in the hinterland. They fought from morning to twelve o'clock in Dazheng Village and finally broke through the encirclement of more than a thousand enemies. Many post offices south of the Yellow River relied on tunnels during countless enemy "encirclements" and "sweeps" to maintain wartime contact and resolutely implement the policy of persisting on the spot. Some comrades were even dragged out of tunnels by the enemy, but after escaping danger, they still persisted in the hinterland. After being wounded, Lü Zhong'an of Minquan Post Office hid in the reeds during the enemy's encirclement. Because the injury was too severe, he did not change the dressing for more than ten days, and one arm was completely rotten. He often hid in tunnels to persist. His family kept two public rickshaws. The enemy arrested his second younger brother and held him for three days, but he never handed over the rickshaws to the enemy. In the situation where Chiang Kai-shek's bandits densely set up碉堡 (pillboxes) along the Yellow River and airplanes bombed day and night, attempting to divide our North-South connection south of the Yellow River, our Second District Station passed through the 140-li blockade line of the Yellow River with the enemy, walking all night to get through. Postal worker Zhao Fu ran 280 li in two nights and finally completed the arduous task. During the Yellow River flood period, Gu Soujiang, a postal worker at the Seventh Station, jumped into the Yellow River torrent under enemy aircraft strafing, floated to the other bank three li away, and finally maintained contact. According to incomplete statistics, after two years of cruel struggle, we gloriously sacrificed our lives for the people's postal service. They include Qiu Jianyuan, director of Longhai Sub-bureau, Wang Taizhen, director of Yutai Bureau, Lu Jingyu, director of Jinan Bureau, Zhang Zhenlei, director of Hua County Bureau, and as many as fifty-two postal workers. In persisting in wartime postal contact, after countless battles, large and small, in 1947 alone, according to incomplete statistics: 32 Chiang Kai-shek bandit soldiers were captured, three light machine guns, one gun body, twenty-two rifles, six Mauser pistols and handguns, nine hundred and forty-five rounds of ammunition, one war horse, one telephone, one hundred and eight thousand Chiang Kai-shek currency, and one hundred silver coins were seized. In the past two years, thanks to the sacrifices and struggles of all our postal workers, moving forward bravely, we have overcome all the difficulties given by the enemy's division, blockade, "encirclement," and "sweeping," until finally our entire Hebei-Shandong-Henan was liberated, and the people regained the freedom of communication. The bandits never truly cut off the connection between the vast military and civilians in the enemy's rear and the rear.
    In June 1947, after the fifth branch bureau director meeting, a rapid meritorious service campaign was launched throughout the region. Each county increased direct shifts. Then the post office, newspaper office, and printing bureau launched the "Four Quicks Campaign" of editing, proofreading, printing, and distribution. Newspapers were distributed as soon as they arrived, regardless of wind, rain, day, or night, and they could be dispatched and arrive on time, with a great increase in speed compared to before. In the past, newspapers sent to various branch bureaus generally took five to ten days to be transferred, and often three or two issues were sent together. Since the launch of the rapid movement, on the 150-li trunk line to the Sixth Branch Bureau, relying on pedestrian delivery, it could be reached in thirteen hours, and nearby counties could see the number one newspaper in two days. On the 140-li trunk line of the Fourth Branch Bureau, newspapers could be distributed to rural areas in three to four days. The Third and Fifth Branch Bureaus often saw newspapers in seven to ten days in the past. Later, on the 300-li trunk line, the number two newspaper could be seen on the fifth, and the general speed was one to five days faster than before. Except for delays due to wartime, the rainy season time was generally guaranteed. The one-way trip speed of mail from top to bottom was 200 li per day and night. The speed of mail from bottom to top was 100 li per day and night due to the one-way traffic on the trunk line. By 1949, in addition to the first and seventh branch bureaus being assigned to eight counties in Shandong, the total length of the trunk lines in the region was 1,381 li, the total length of the branch lines was 2,350 li, and the total length of the trunk and branch lines was 3,731 li. The horizontal connection between counties has now been opened up. In terms of business, the stamp system was implemented on April 1, 1946, unifying the postal work in the region, initially establishing a relatively complete set of business forms and procedures, opening remittance and parcel delivery businesses, demarcating the trunk line stations in the region, separating bureaus and stations, and organizing the military post offices of each column of the Liu-Deng army. In 1947, the remittance business was also opened, and the procedures began to move towards unification. Later, due to the tense combat situation south of the Yellow River, local military post offices and armed transportation teams were organized to strengthen wartime contact. After the April 1948 meeting, the organization was streamlined, the leadership was unified, so that postal work gradually moved towards enterprise, cadres began to establish professional ideas, branch bureaus were abolished, the main trunk line was strengthened, the contact between neighboring regions began to be close, and the horizontal connection between counties was opened up. Rural postal organizations were generally established and rectified in Hebei. As of November 1948, a total of 237 agency offices, 30 postal service offices, 294 rural postal stations, 77 rural postal points, 23 letter boxes, and 4 agency sales points were established, initially exploring the experience of rural postal construction. An organized reorganization was carried out, and various new postal improvement systems began to be implemented.

　　三年来的冀鲁豫邮政
    冀鲁豫分社
    一九四六年的四月一日，是冀鲁豫在抗日战争中建设起来的战时交通局改为邮政局的日子。从此邮局便贯彻了企业化的方针，开始执行了邮票制度。而这个人民邮政局诞生不及三个月，蒋匪军便向边区大举进攻，我们的人民邮政局，在“一切服从前线”的口号下，又迅速转为战时邮政。陇海战役开始后，在三天内抽调了八十名邮政员工，组织了×个军邮局，随着刘、邓大军担负着前后方的联系任务。在军邮未成立前，记者团的稿件，从前方寄到报社需时半月，军邮建立后，只需一天至两天时间，最迟也不过三天；三百华里的豫北前线上，三天可看到报纸。邮工不分昼夜不避风雨，冒着敌机的扫射，日以继夜的奔跑，每天步行在一百华里以上。在豫北前线军邮宋又法、江凤先、陈建平等邮工，并曾在传递邮件的途中歼敌一股，俘敌六名，缴机枪两挺，步枪三支，子弹六百发。据不完全统计：以光荣免费待遇传递的军邮件，一九四七年为三万六千六百件，一九四八年下半年仅黄河北三十个县，收寄即达四万一千三百三十件，保证供给了前方部队的政治文化食粮。战士在战场上可经常看到报纸和家庭翻身后的消息，鼓舞了战士们的作战情绪，有力的支援了战争。
    蒋匪军侵占我黄河以南地区之后，我五分局局长亲率三个武装交通班，在腹地坚持战邮联系，曾在大郑庄自早上一直战斗到十二点，终于冲破了千余敌人的包围。黄河南不少邮局均曾在敌人无数次反复“清剿”、“扫荡”中，依靠地道，坚持着战时联系，坚决执行了就地坚持的方针；也有的同志在地道里被敌人抓出，脱险后仍旧在腹地坚持。民权邮局吕中安挂彩后，在敌人清剿时藏在苇子里，因为伤势过重，十几天没换药，一个胳膊都烂完了；他经常是藏在地道里坚持；他家保存公家洋车两辆，敌人将他二弟抓去押了三天，始终没把车子献给敌人。在蒋匪于黄河沿岸密设碉堡，飞机日夜轮番轰炸，企图分割我黄河南北联系的情况下，我二区站通过黄河与敌人一百四十里的封锁线，都是步行一夜通过去。邮工赵福两夜连跑二百八十里，终于完成了艰苦的任务。黄河大泛期，七站邮工顾搜江，在敌机扫射下跳到黄河洪流里，顺水流到三里以外的对岸，终于保持了联系。经过二年来的残酷斗争，我们为人民邮政事业奋斗光荣殉职的，据不完全统计，有陇海支局长邱建元、鱼台局长王太真、济南局长鹿景欲、滑县局长张振雷等干部以及邮工五十二名之多。在坚持战邮联系中，经过了大小无数次的战斗，仅一九四七年不完全统计：俘蒋匪军卅二名、缴获轻机枪三挺、枪身一个、步枪廿二支、匣枪、手枪六支、子弹九四五发、战马一匹、电话机一架、蒋币十万零八百元、银币百元。二年来由于我们全邮政员工的牺牲奋斗，勇往直前，战胜了敌人的分割、封锁、“清剿”、“扫荡”所给予的一切困难，直到最后我冀鲁豫全获解放，人民重新获得了通讯上的自由。匪徒们从未真正割断了我广大敌后军民与后方的联系。
    一九四七年的六月间，五次分局长会议后，全区又开展了快速立功运动，各县都增加了直班，接着邮局、报社、印刷局，开展了编、校、印、发行的“四快运动”，报纸随到随发，无论风雨昼夜，都能按时出发，按时到达，速度比前大有提高。过去发往各分局的报纸，一般五天至十天才能转到，而且常是三期两期一块送。自开展快速运动后，距六分局一百五十里干线上，依靠步行传递，十三小时即可到达，附近县二日可看到一号的报纸。四分局一百四十里干线上，三天至四天报纸可发行到农村。三、五分局过去常是七天至十天看到报纸，后来在三百里的干线上，五号可看到二号的报纸，一般速度比前增快一天至五天。除因战争时间迟延外，一般连雨季时间都有保证，自上而下的邮件一昼夜行程速度为二百华里。自下而上的邮件，因干线单轨对流的关系，一昼夜行程为一百华里。至一九四九年，除一、七分局划归山东八个县外，全区干线全长一三八一里，支线全长二三五零里，干支线共三七三一里，现已打通了县与县之间横的联系。在业务上，自一九四六年四月一日，开始执行邮票制度，统一了全区的邮政工作，初步建立了一套较完整的业务表格和手续，开办了解款与收寄包裹业务，划定了全区干线站，使局与站分开，组织了刘、邓大军各纵队的军邮局。一九四七年又开办了汇兑业务，手续开始走向了统一。后因黄河南战斗情况紧张组织了地方军邮局和武交队，加强了战时联系。一九四八年四月会议后，简编了组织，统一了领导，使邮政工作又逐渐走向企业化，干部开始树立专业化的思想，取消了分局，加强了总干线，开始密切了邻区联系，打通了县与县之间横的联系。河北普遍建立与整顿了乡邮组织。截止一九四八年十一月，共建立了代办所二百三十七处，邮务所三十处，乡邮站二百九十四处，乡邮点七十七处，信柜二十三处，代售处四处，初步摸索了乡邮建设的经验。有组织的进行了整编，开始贯彻了各种新的邮务改进制度。
