Xinhua News Agency, Tianjin, 5th. The Tianjin Military Control Commission invited over a hundred workers from major enterprises and factories in the city to a symposium on the 22nd of last month. This symposium, the first convened by the Tianjin Military Control Commission after entering the city, was personally presided over by Deputy Directors Huang Kecheng and Huang Jing. When the workers entered the auditorium, Deputy Directors Huang Kecheng and Huang Jing shook hands with them one by one, and the entire auditorium was filled with a pleasant and joyful atmosphere. At the symposium, Deputy Director Huang Jing first extended his condolences on behalf of the Military Control Commission to the workers of the city who had suffered greatly under the rule of the Kuomintang. He also actively praised the workers' positive spirit in protecting the factories and resuming work during the battle to liberate Tianjin. Deputy Director Huang explained that the main purpose of convening this symposium was to solicit the workers' opinions on the various facilities established by the Military Control Commission since its establishment, as well as the current resumption of work and workers' lives. In the speeches of the workers from various factories, they expressed satisfaction with the measures taken by the Military Control Commission after entering the city, such as quickly leading the workers to resume work, promptly lending wages, and giving preferential treatment to workers when redeeming counterfeit gold yuan coupons. Regarding the future study and welfare of the workers, the speakers hoped to establish workers' literacy classes and worker newspapers, establish trade unions, set up employee cooperatives, and appropriately solve the employment problems of unemployed workers. At the same time, they also hoped that appropriate adjustments could be made to the salaries of workers and staff in various factories. The workers also raised some questions about the future sources of raw materials for the factories (such as cotton, gasoline, etc.), and provided many opinions on improving technology and increasing production. Finally, the Director and Deputy Director of the Military Control Commission also spoke successively, pointing out that Tianjin is now owned by the people. Although our workers are still working indoors, the political and economic status of workers is different from the past. In public enterprises, the things created by the labor of employees are used to develop construction, support the people's revolutionary war, and improve the material life of employees and the people, and there is no more exploitation in between. Therefore, employees should establish a new work attitude, actively produce, and improve efficiency so that the industry of the new China can develop rapidly. Employees in private enterprises have also been given certain guarantees in terms of political and economic rights. The life of workers should be maintained at a certain level, and the impact of price fluctuations on the lives of workers should be avoided or reduced as much as possible. We cannot hope that the material life of workers will improve immediately after liberation, because we are still in wartime, and our country's industry is very underdeveloped, but as the economy develops, the lives of workers can be gradually improved. In order to encourage everyone to study technology, improve efficiency, and continuously improve, employee salary treatment should, in addition to those senior personnel in certain enterprises who are indeed too disparate, still maintain the difference due to the different quality of labor. It is unreasonable to eliminate or reduce this difference. Finally, Li Jiebo, director of the Tianjin Office of the Preparatory Committee of the All-China Federation of Trade Unions, also answered many specific questions raised by the workers separately. After the meeting, the Military Control Commission also treated the workers to dinner and a movie.

　　天津军管会召开座谈会
  　征求工人对复工的意见
    【新华社天津五日电】天津市军管会于上月二十二日邀请全市各大企业工厂的百余工人举行座谈会。天津军管会在入城后首次召开的这一座谈会，系由黄克诚、黄敬正副主任亲临主持，当工人们步入礼堂时，黄克诚、黄敬正副主任都与他们一一握手，整个礼堂内充满了愉快欢欣的气氛。座谈会上黄敬副主任首先代表军管会向全市在国民党统治时期深受迫害的工人致以慰问，并对解放天津之战中工人们在护厂复工中所表现的积极精神，积极赞扬。黄副主任说明召集这次座谈会的主要目的，是征求工人们对于军管会成立以来各项设施及目前的复工复业工人生活等方面的意见。在各厂工人的发言中，对军管会入城后迅速领导工人复工，及时借给工资以及在收兑伪金圆券时予工人以优待等措施均表满意，关于今后工人的学习及生活福利，发言中都希望创办工人的补习班和工人报纸，成立工会，兴办职工合作社以及适当解决失业职工的职业问题。同时并希望对各厂工人与职员的薪资能做适当调整。对于今后工厂原料来源（如棉花、汽油等），工人们亦提出若干询问，并在改良技术提高生产方面提供了许多意见。最后，军管会正副主任亦相继发言，指出：天津市现在已是属于人民所有了。我们工人虽然仍在室内做工，可是工人的政治地位和经济地位和过去不一样了。在公营企业中职工劳动所创造出来的东西，都是用来发展建设、支援人民革命战争和改善职工及人民的物质生活，其间再也没有什么剥削。因此职工们应树立新的劳动态度，积极生产，提高效率，使新中国的工业能够迅速发展。私营企业中的职工，在政治和经济的权利方面也得到了一定的保障。工人的生活，应使维持一定的水平，尽量避免或减少物价波动所给予工人生活的影响。我们不能希望在解放以后，工人物质生活一下就会提高，因为目前还是处在战时，而且我们国家的工业又很不发达，但是随着经济的发展，工人的生活就能够逐渐地改善。为了鼓励大家研究技术，提高效率，不断进步，职工薪资待遇除了某些企业中的高级人员确实过于悬殊者外，其他仍应维持因劳动质量的不同而有的差别。取消或缩小这种差别是不合理的。最后华北总工会筹委会天津办事处主任李颉伯，亦就工人提出的许多具体问题，分别作了解答。会后，军管会并招待工人晚餐、看电影。
