　　Tangshan Tangjiazhuang Coal Sales Cooperative

　　Tangjiazhuang, a place where coal is produced, has tens of thousands of workers digging coal every day. During the rule of the Chiang Kai-shek bandits, it was extremely difficult for ordinary people to haul a cart of coal. There was only one monopolized coal bureau here. Carts lined up one after another outside the coal bureau, forming long queues, many of which were broken and unusable. Coal merchants used them to occupy the spaces day and night, and the workers and farmers who came to collect or sell coal properly had to wait at the end of the line. Sometimes workers were late for work because of waiting for coal; because it was difficult to haul coal, they had to sell their hard-earned coal tickets cheaply. Farmers in the surrounding villages sometimes had to wait for two or three days, incurring high expenses for accommodation and food, and delaying production. If they didn't want to wait, they had to pay double the price to buy from coal merchants, and the amount of coal was also insufficient. Coal merchants could sneak coal lumps (coal lumps sell for more money) inside, but when it was the turn of the workers and farmers in line to load coal, they could only load fine coal dust. Therefore, the common people cursed endlessly when they talked about hauling coal.

　　After liberation, the workers, led by the militia, began to organize a "Coal Sales Cooperative." With the support of the democratic government, it started selling coal on New Year's Day. The work in the past seven days has been highly praised and supported by employees and farmers in the surrounding villages, and it has influenced the old coal bureau to gradually improve in a reasonable direction. For example, the phenomenon of coal merchants sneaking coal lumps has been reduced.

　　The employees of the cooperative take their own coal tickets to haul coal, not only for free, but also to be hauled immediately. Farmers only pay an additional 20,000 Changcheng currency in handling fees per ton. In order to prevent employees from suffering losses, the cooperative has increased the purchase price of coal tickets from less than 120,000 (Changcheng currency) per ton to 160,000, and is preparing to purchase in large quantities. In the past, farmers who bought coal had to pay more than 200,000 per ton, and the amount was insufficient; now, with handling fees, it is only 180,000, and the amount is sufficient. Moreover, it is now forbidden to sneak coal lumps, and all the coal hauled out is raw coal with mixed lumps and fines.

　　The old coal bureau had fixed hours for selling coal, and it had to close at break time. Some people had finally reached their turn, but unfortunately it happened to be the time to stop selling, so they had to continue waiting. The employees of the new cooperative fully demonstrated the spirit of serving the workers and peasants, taking turns eating, and working non-stop from morning to night, settling accounts once a day, often working until late at night.

　　They encourage farmers in the surrounding villages to bring grain and exchange it for coal at the market price. Workers can exchange grain for coal from the cooperative. Once promoted, it will greatly help the smooth exchange of materials between urban and rural areas.

　　In order to widely attract shares, it is stipulated that all employees of the cooperative can freely participate in the shares of the cooperative. With the support of workers and peasants, the number of shares has increased from the initial 43 and a half to more than 100 in seven days; the sales of coal have also increased from more than 40 tons sold in half a day at the beginning to 220 tons on the seventh day. People who haul coal praised that hauling coal at the cooperative is "pleasant everywhere." A farmer from Luanxian said: "It is really convenient to haul coal here. It is loaded as soon as you arrive, and it is still good raw coal. I will definitely go back and tell them all to come and haul it." People from Luan Si, Fengrun, Qian'an, Lulong and other counties have also heard the news and started hauling coal.

　　"The People's Liberation Army is really serving the people everywhere!" These are the words of the people who haul coal. In the small matter of hauling coal, we can also see how the people support the People's Liberation Army. On the afternoon of the 7th, the ×× Field Hospital came to haul coal from forty or fifty miles away. When the employees of the cooperative asked everyone to let them load first, so as not to let the wounded suffer from the cold, the common people immediately cleared the crowded carts and horses, and let them drive the carts to the front to help load coal, and said: "This is also supporting the front line!"

　　The cooperative has not been established for long, and as the number of coal buyers increases day by day, the business will be expanded. Coal merchants are generally hard-working people. The government will also guide them to change their previous improper ways of making a living and turn to legitimate production.　　　　　(Li Yuan)

### 唐山唐家庄的　售煤合作社

　　唐山唐家庄的
  　售煤合作社
    唐家庄这座出煤的地方，每天有上万的工人在刨煤，蒋匪统治期间，老百姓要想拉车煤却困难重重。这里只有一家专利的煤局子，煤局子门外的大车一辆压一辆，成年堆成长长行列，其中许多是破烂不能用的，煤贩子用他昼夜占着位子，正经来领煤或卖煤的工人们和农民们只好排在末尾等。工人有时因等煤误了上工；因煤难拉，只好贱价出售血汗换来的煤票。四乡农民们有时要等上两三天，住店吃饭挑费大，还要耽误生产，要想不等只有加倍出钱从煤贩子手里买，煤的分量又不足。煤贩子可以进到里面溜煤块（煤块多卖钱），排队的工人农民轮到装煤了，只能装些细煤面。所以老百姓提起拉煤来都骂不绝声。
    解放后，以纠察队为首的工人们就着手组织“售煤合作社”，在民主政府扶助下，已于元旦开始售煤，一洗往日在煤局子售煤的各种黑暗，七天来的工作表现极受员工及四乡农民的称赞和拥护，并影响旧煤局子逐渐向合理方面改进，如煤贩子溜煤块的现象已经减少了。
    该合作社员工们拿自己的煤票去拉煤，不但免费，而且马上就拉。农民们每吨也只多花两万长城币的手续费。为了使员工不吃亏，合作社收买煤票，已由从前每吨不到十二万（长城币）的价格提高到十六万，并准备大量收买。买煤的农民们，从前每吨要超过二十万，分量又不足；现在加上手续费不过十八万，而分量十足。并且现在不许溜煤块，拉出去的都是块面混合的原煤。
    旧煤局子，售煤时间有一定，到休息时间一定要关门。有的人好容易轮到自己了，不幸恰恰碰到停售的时间，也就只好继续等着。新的合作社员工们，充分发挥为工农服务的精神，轮流吃饭，从早到晚片刻不停，每天算帐一次，常常忙到深夜。
    他们鼓励四乡农民拿粮食来，按市价折合换煤，工人用煤炭就可从合作社换到粮食，推动起来以后，将大大帮助城乡物资的顺畅交流。
    为了广泛招股，规定合作社的股份凡是合作社员工都可自由参加。在工农的拥护下，七天来由最初的四十三股半已增到一百多股；售煤股也由开市半天卖出的四十多吨，增到第七天一天的二百二十吨。拉煤的人们纷纷称道在合作社拉煤“处处痛快”。滦县来的一个农民说：“这里拉煤真方便，到了就装，装的还是好原煤，我一定回去叫他们都来拉。”滦四、丰润、迁安、芦龙等县的老百姓，现也闻信开始来拉煤了。
    “解放军来了，真是处处为人民”！这是拉煤人民的话，在拉煤的一件小事情上，也看到了人民如何拥护解放军。七号这天下午，××野战医院从四五十里以外来拉煤，当合作社员工向大家要求让他们先装，免得伤员受冻时，老百姓马上闪开了拥挤的车马，让他们把车赶到前面帮助装煤，并说：“这也是支援前线哪！”
    合作社建立不久，由于买煤的人日益增多，业务将加以扩大。煤贩子一般都是劳苦卖力气的人，政府也将引导他们改变以往不正当的谋生办法，使转向正当的生产方面去。  　　　　　（李远）
