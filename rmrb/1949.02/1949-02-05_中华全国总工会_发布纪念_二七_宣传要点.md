Xinhua News Agency, Northeast, 2nd. The All-China Federation of Trade Unions yesterday issued a notice commemorating the 26th anniversary of the "February 7th" Strike. The full text is as follows: To the General Trade Unions of all Liberated Areas and forwarded to all subordinate Trade Unions:

　　The 26th anniversary of the "February 7th" struggle, which Chinese working class waged in 1923 to fight for the freedom to organize trade unions and to oppose the oppression of imperialism and feudal warlords, is coming soon. In this struggle, the Chinese working class demonstrated its strong revolutionary spirit and indomitable heroic spirit; as soon as it stepped onto the political stage, it became the vanguard of the Chinese people's anti-imperialist and anti-feudal movement. At present, with the People's Liberation War gaining unprecedented victories, the Kuomintang reactionary government is about to completely collapse, and national victory is in sight, commemorating "February 7th" has particularly significant meaning. Trade unions in various localities should conduct extensive publicity among the working masses, especially among the workers in the newly liberated Tianjin area and major railways (especially the Pinghan Railway), and organize various forms of mass commemorative meetings (such as worker forums, activist evenings, mass rallies, etc.). We put forward the following publicity points for your reference.

　　(1) Commemorating "February 7th" should be closely linked with the current opposition to the Kuomintang's fake peace and the striving for genuine democratic and lasting peace. We must use the many historical facts of the Chinese working class's struggle for freedom and survival after "February 7th," which suffered the Kuomintang's cruel suppression and massacre as imperialist running dogs, to illustrate that the working class cannot turn over unless the revolution is carried through to the end and the Kuomintang's reactionary rule is completely ended. It is necessary to call on the working masses to support the eight conditions for genuine democratic peace put forward by Chairman Mao Zedong. If the Kuomintang reactionaries refuse or distort these eight conditions, it proves that they have no sincerity for peace, but are only attempting to preserve their remaining reactionary military forces under the guise of false peace slogans, in order to regroup and stage a comeback. Then our working class must use all its strength to support the People's Liberation Army, thoroughly eliminate the Kuomintang reactionary army, and thoroughly crush the Kuomintang reactionary government as a way to deal with this false peace.

　　(2) It should be explained that the working class in the liberated areas now not only has obtained the freedom to organize trade unions, which the Chinese working class shed blood to obtain in the "February 7th" era, but has also become the leader of the democratic regime and the master of the state and society. In state-owned enterprises, workers participate in production management, changing from the status of wage slaves who were oppressed and exploited in the past to the masters of the enterprise. To consolidate this achieved revolutionary fruit, workers must develop a new master's attitude towards labor, assume full responsibility for production, strive to increase the quantity of products, improve the quality of products, cherish machines, save raw materials, and reduce costs. In factories and enterprises in the newly liberated areas that have been damaged, employees should work hard to repair machines and donate equipment so that production can start as soon as possible. In private enterprises, the interests of workers can also be guaranteed. They should strive to increase production under the conditions of mutual benefit between labor and capital to support the People's Liberation War. All employees should carry forward the revolutionary spirit of the "February 7th" heroes, lead the people of the whole country, carry the revolution through to the end, and struggle to build a prosperous and happy New China of New Democracy.

　　(3) To commemorate "February 7th," it is necessary to call on workers to establish and consolidate the organization of trade unions, strengthen the connection between trade unions and the working masses, and promote the use of mutual assistance and cooperation to carry out various worker welfare undertakings. At the same time, trade unions should assist the administration in gradually implementing the democratization of enterprise management by establishing factory worker representative conferences and other methods.

　　(4) Democratic trade unions in the Kuomintang-controlled areas should estimate the situation permitted by objective conditions, or take advantage of various gatherings of workers to connect with the current situation, publicize "February 7th," and organize open or semi-open commemorative meetings, or only conduct oral or written publicity. The main propaganda slogans are: inherit the heroic spirit of the "February 7th" struggle, support the People's Liberation Army in liberating all of China, oppose the Kuomintang's reactionary and false peace, support Chairman Mao Zedong's eight peace conditions, oppose the Kuomintang's relocation and destruction of factories, protect machines, protect factories, and prepare to welcome the People's Liberation Army.

### 中华全国总工会　发布纪念“二七”宣传要点

　　中华全国总工会
  　发布纪念“二七”宣传要点
    【新华社东北二日电】中华全国总工会昨日发布纪念“二七”二十六周年通知，全文如下：各解放区职工总会并转所属各职工会：
    中国工人阶级为争取组织工会的自由、反对帝国主义和封建军阀压迫、而在一九二三年举行的“二七”斗争的二十六周年纪念日，就要到来了。中国工人阶级在这次斗争中，已表现出坚强的革命性和不屈不挠的英勇精神；一走上政治舞台，就成了中国人民反帝反封建运动的先锋队。在目前人民解放战争获得空前胜利、国民党反动政府很快就要完全垮台、全国胜利在望的环境中，纪念“二七”，有特别重大的意义。各地职工会，应在职工群众中特别在新解放的平津地区及各大铁路（尤其是平汉铁路）的工人群众中，进行广泛的宣传，并组织各种形式的群众纪念会（如工人座谈会、积极分子晚会、群众大会等）。我们提出下列几项宣传要点，供各地参考。
    （一）纪念“二七”，要与目前反对国民党假和平、争取真正的民主的永久和平密切地联系起来。要用工人阶级在“二七”以后争自由争生存的斗争遭受帝国主义走狗国民党残酷镇压屠杀的许多历史事实，来说明不把革命进行到底，不彻底结束国民党反动统治，工人阶级是无法翻身的。要号召工人群众，拥护毛泽东主席提出的真正民主和平的八项条件。如果国民党反动派拒绝或歪曲这八项条件，便是证明他们毫无和平诚意，只是企图以虚假的和平口号保存残余反动武力，以便重整旗鼓，卷土重来，则我工人阶级便要用全力支援人民解放军，彻底消灭国民党反动军队，彻底粉碎国民党反动政府的方法，来对付这种虚假的和平。
    （二）说明现在解放区的工人阶级，不仅获得了“二七”时代中国工人阶级所流血争取的组织工会的自由，而且成了民主政权的领导者，国家社会的主人。在公营企业中，工人参加了生产管理，从过去受压迫剥削的工钱奴隶的地位，变成了企业的主人翁。要巩固这一既得的革命果实，工人们必须发扬新的主人翁的劳动态度，负起全部的生产责任，努力提高生产品的数量，改善生产品的质量，爱护机器，节省原料，减低成本。在新解放地区遭受了破坏的工厂企业中，职工们要努力修复机器，献纳器材，以便早日开工生产。在私营企业中，工人的利益也能得到保障，应在劳资两利的条件下，努力增加生产来支援人民解放战争。全体职工们均应发扬“二七”英雄们的革命精神，并领导全国人民，把革命进行到底，为建立新民主主义的繁荣幸福的新中国而斗争。
    （三）纪念“二七”，要号召工人建立和巩固职工会的组织，密切职工会与工人群众的联系，提倡以互助合作的方法，举办各种职工福利事业。同时，职工会要以建立工厂职工代表会议等方式，协助行政逐渐实行企业管理民主化。
    （四）国民党统治区各民主工会，应估计客观条件所许可的情况，或借工人群众种种集会的机会，来联系目前时局，宣传“二七”，组织公开或半公开的纪念会，或只作口头或文字的宣传。主要的宣传口号，是继承“二七”斗争的英勇精神，拥护人民解放军解放全中国，反对国民党反动的虚假的和平，拥护毛泽东主席八项和平条件，反对国民党迁移和破坏工厂，保护机器，保护工厂，准备迎接人民解放军。
