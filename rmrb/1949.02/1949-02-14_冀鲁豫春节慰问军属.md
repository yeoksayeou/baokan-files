  　Spring Festival Comforts to Military Families
    [Ji-Lu-Yu Electric] During the Lunar New Year, government offices and the masses in Ji-Lu-Yu extensively launched warm military support activities while celebrating the Spring Festival. In addition to the allocation of preferential grain by various counties to solve the difficulties faced by military families and revolutionary martyrs' families during the New Year, the masses in various places also voluntarily visited and comforted them. In Helisi, the Fourth District of Nanfeng, a tea party was held before the New Year, and village cadres humbly solicited opinions from military families on various matters. The Yanggu Chengguan Working Group held a symposium for military families and conducted individual visits to understand their difficulties and help them solve them. In Tianhai, Fifth District of Jiaxiang, three military families were facing livelihood difficulties due to the autumn floods. The government issued preferential grain, and the community cadres, worried that they would not be able to get through the year, helped them raise grain. In many places, the masses put forward the slogan "Guaranteeing military families have no difficulties," and raised donations for consolation. In Wuwang Village and Baidaokou Village in the Fourth District of Gaoling, a warm donation and consolation campaign was launched before the New Year. Each military family in the village received more than three catties of meat, and the poorest military families were also subsidized with wheat grain. Poor peasant Zhang Cuiyun, originally a refugee, had a relatively difficult life, but he insisted on donating one thousand yuan, saying, "Chiang Kai-shek is about to be finished. In order to make the soldiers on the front lines more determined to kill the enemy and quickly defeat the reactionaries, it's nothing for us to suffer a little!" His actions greatly moved the military families. Shuangcheng's mother, a military family member, said, "I must write to Shuangcheng and tell him to perform meritorious service well, quickly defeat the reactionaries, and repay everyone's kindness." On Lunar New Year's Eve, in many places in Yuncheng, Heze, and other places, the masses blew trumpets and beat gongs and drums to send glory lamps, paste couplets, send firecrackers, sweep courtyards, and fetch water for military families. On New Year's Day, the Political Commissar and Commissioner of the Sixth Military District gathered military workers and revolutionary martyrs' families in Chengguan at the "Minyou" Theater in Liaocheng for a get-together, dinner, and condolences. Before holding a group worship with the masses on New Year's Day, the cadres of the Yanggu County Government first paid New Year's greetings to the military families and revolutionary martyrs' families. Zhang Fuquan, a revolutionary martyr's family member, excitedly said to everyone, "Everyone sent lamps and meat, I am very moved. Although my eldest son sacrificed, if the reactionaries are not defeated, I will send my second son to join the army."
