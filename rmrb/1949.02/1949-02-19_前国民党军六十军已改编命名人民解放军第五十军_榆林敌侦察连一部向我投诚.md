　　Xinhua News Agency, Shenyang, 15th. The former Kuomintang 60th Army, which revolted in Changchun last October, was reorganized into the People's Liberation Army 50th Army according to the order of the General Headquarters of the People's Liberation Army. A grand naming ceremony was held at the garrison on the 29th of last month. Representatives from all divisions and directly subordinate units of the army participated, and Zhou Baozhong, Deputy Commander of the Northeast Military Region, also attended in person. At the meeting, Deputy Commander Zhou read out the order from the General Headquarters of the People's Liberation Army reorganizing the former Kuomintang 60th Army into the Liberation Army 50th Army. Army Commander Zeng Zesheng and Political Commissar Xu Wenlie immediately accepted on behalf of the entire army and paid their respects to the portraits of Chairman Mao and Commander-in-Chief Zhu. Deputy Commander Zhou then addressed the assembly, saying: "In the past, the 60th Army, deceived by the Kuomintang reactionary group, became a tool against the revolution and the people. Now, the 60th Army has officially joined the ranks of the people's army. However, changing from an anti-people army to a people's army is not enough by simply changing the name, but requires a process of complete transformation. Therefore, I hope that the entire army will quickly begin political rectification and training, promote democracy, and raise awareness in order to catch up with other fraternal units and become a truly people's liberation army." Army Commander Zeng Zesheng then spoke, vehemently denouncing the Kuomintang reactionary group's deceptive policies and saying: "If we want to take revenge and overthrow the reactionaries, we must conduct revolutionary education under the banner of Chairman Mao and under the direct leadership of the leaders of the Northeast Military Region. We must transform our old ideas, eliminate bad habits, support the policies of the Chinese Communist Party, support land reform, strictly abide by the Three Main Rules of Discipline and the Eight Points for Attention, and be determined to transform the troops into a genuine people's army. Only in this way can we live up to the hopes of Chairman Mao and Commander-in-Chief Zhu." Political Commissar Xu Wenlie called on the entire army in his speech to study hard, establish a firm class viewpoint, and establish a good style of work in which officers love soldiers and soldiers love the people, in order to complete the education plan in a short period of time. Division commanders and soldier representatives spoke successively, all expressing their determination to transform themselves, transform the troops, and serve the people. Finally, Army Commander Zeng led the entire army in taking an oath and passed a telegram of respect to Chairman Mao and Commander-in-Chief Zhu.
    Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, 15th. A part of the reconnaissance company of the Special Service Battalion of the Kuomintang Army Jin-Shaan-Sui Border Region Headquarters, totaling fifty-five people, led by platoon leader Duan Yunzhang and Quan Jihua, surrendered to the Liberation Army on the 5th. The unit brought with them six light machine guns, thirty-five rifles, and some ammunition.

　　前国民党军六十军已改编命名人民解放军第五十军
    榆林敌侦察连一部向我投诚
    【新华社沈阳十五日电】去年十月在长春起义的前国民党军六十军奉人民解放军总部命令改编为人民解放军第五十军，已于上月二十九日在驻地隆重举行授名典礼。全军各师及军直官兵均派代表参加，东北军区周保中副司令员亦亲自出席。周副司令员在会上宣读人民解放军总部改编前国民党六十军为解放军第五十军的命令，曾泽生军长、徐文烈政委当即代表全军接受，并向毛主席、朱总司令肖像致敬。周副司令员继即向大会讲话说：“过去六十军在国民党反动集团欺骗下，成为反革命反人民的工具，现在六十军是正式参加人民军队的行列了。但是，由反人民的军队变为人民的军队，只是换个名字还不够，而要经过脱胎换骨的过程。因此希望全军迅速开始政治整训，发扬民主，提高觉悟，以求赶上其他兄弟部队，成为名符其实的人民解放军。”曾泽生军长接着讲话，他于痛斥国民党反动集团的欺骗政策后说：“我们要报仇，要打倒反动派，就要在毛主席的旗帜下，在东北军区诸首长的直接领导下，进行革命的教育。我们要改造旧思想，肃清坏作风，拥护中国共产党的政策，拥护土地改革，严格遵守三大纪律八项注意，决心把部队改造成为真正的人民军队。只有这样才不负毛主席和朱总司令对我们的希望。”徐文烈政委在讲话中号召全军努力学习，树立坚定的阶级观点，建立官爱兵、兵爱民的优良作风，以求在短期内完成教育计划。各师长及士兵代表相继讲话，均表示决心改造自己，改造部队，为人民服务。最后由曾军长率全军举行宣誓，并通过向毛主席朱总司令致敬电。
