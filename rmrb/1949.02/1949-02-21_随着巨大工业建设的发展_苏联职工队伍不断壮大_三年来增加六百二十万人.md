　　With the Development of Huge Industrial Construction
　　The Soviet Workforce Continues to Grow
　　An Increase of 6.2 Million People in Three Years
　　[Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 19th] With the implementation of massive industrial construction plans, the Soviet workforce of workers and staff is continuously expanding. According to TASS: In the past three years, the number of Soviet workers and staff has increased by 6.2 million. This fact proves that the planned system of training labor reserves is completely reasonable. The number of technical workers graduating from labor reserve schools and going to various factories is increasing every year. From 1946 to 1947, these schools trained more than one million skilled workers, and among the more than two million new workers and staff added last year, 50 percent were trained by technical schools and factory-affiliated vocational schools. In recent years, millions of young men and women who have learned technology in technical schools have now become experienced and highly skilled workers. They are outstanding members participating in socialist competition and striving to complete the Five-Year Plan ahead of schedule.
　　The growth in the number of employees is inseparable from the massive industrial construction plans carried out by the Soviet Union in the past few years after the war. In the past three years, the Soviet Union has restored and newly built approximately four thousand state-owned enterprises. Among them, eight hundred went into production in 1946, one thousand one hundred went into production in 1947, and two thousand one hundred went into production in 1948.

　　随着巨大工业建设的发展
  　苏联职工队伍不断壮大
    三年来增加六百二十万人
    【新华社陕北十九日电】随着巨大的工业建设计划的进行，苏联工人与职员的队伍正在不断壮大中。据塔斯社讯：过去三年内，苏联工人与职员的数目增加了六百二十万。事实证明：有计划地训练劳动后备军的制度是完全合理的。从劳动后备学校毕业到各工厂去的各种技术工人，每年都有增加。一九四六到一九四七年，这些学校训练了一百多万熟练工人，而在去年增加的二百多万新工人和职员中，百分之五十都是受工艺学校和工厂中附设的职业学校训练出来的。近几年来，在工艺学校学会了技术的几百万青年男女，现在已成为富有经验和高度熟练的工人，他们是参加社会主义竞赛、争取提前完成五年计划的优秀分子。
    职工人数的增长，与苏联战后几年来所进行的巨大工业建设计划是不可分的。在过去三年内，苏联修复和新建了约四千个国家企业。其中，在一九四六年开工生产的有八百个，在一九四七年开工的有一千一百个，在一九四八年开工的有二千一百个。
