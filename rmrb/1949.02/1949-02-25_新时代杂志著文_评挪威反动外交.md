Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, February 23rd: According to a TASS dispatch from Moscow on the 16th, the latest issue of New Era magazine published an article by Saiding discussing the diplomatic trends of Norway. The article states: On February 5th, the Soviet Union proposed to Norway that the two countries conclude a non-aggression treaty. This step is entirely in line with Norway's interests. However, the first reaction of the ruling circles in Oslo and the right-wing newspapers was obvious confusion. They greeted the Soviet Union's peaceful proposal, intended to end suspicion and strengthen mutual trust, with irritation. The absurd arguments in Norwegian newspapers about the "danger" of the non-aggression treaty are put forward under the guise of protecting Norway's independence and national dignity. However, the comments of some newspapers on Foreign Minister Lange's trip to Washington reveal the true value of the so-called "independent" policy of some Scandinavian rulers. The Swedish Svenska Dagbladet reported based on facts that "Lange went to Washington for instructions." "Expressen" said: "Lange took the Soviet proposal to Washington." What Lange discussed with Acheson and Truman remains secret, but there is no doubt that the United States has exerted enormous pressure on Norway to force it to reject the Soviet proposal and hand over its territory and manpower to the organizers of the aggressive Atlantic alliance. However, the policy of involving Norway and other Scandinavian countries in the imperialist bloc organized by the United States has met with increasing resistance among the people of these countries; the Soviet proposal, which will strengthen Norway's security without harming Norway's interests, has gained increasing sympathy.

  　评挪威反动外交
    【新华社陕北二十三日电】据塔斯社莫斯科十六日讯：最近一期新时代杂志刊载赛丁所著论述挪威外交动向的一篇论文称：本月五日，苏联向挪威提出了两国订立互不侵犯条约的建议。这一步骤是完全与挪威的利益符合的。但是，在奥斯陆统治集团领袖们和右翼报纸的第一个反应，却是明显的混乱。对苏联的意在终结怀疑加强互信的和平建议，它们以激恼来接待它。挪威报纸关于互不侵犯条约的“危险性”的荒谬论调，是在保护挪威独立及国家尊严的假面具下提出的。但是，某些报纸对外长兰基华盛顿之行的评论，却泄露了某些斯堪的纳维亚统治者的所谓“独立”政策的真价值。瑞典斯文斯卡晨报依据事实报导说：“兰基到华盛顿请示去了。”“快讯报”说：“兰基是把苏联的建议带给华盛顿。”兰基与艾奇逊和杜鲁门所谈的东西虽保持着秘密，但无可怀疑：美国曾向挪威施以巨大压力，以逼迫它拒绝苏联的建议，并将其国土与人力交由侵略性的大西洋联盟的组织者支配。然而，把挪威本国和其他斯堪的纳维亚国家卷入美国所组织的帝国主义集团的政策，已在这些国家的人民中间遭到了日益增加的反抗；将会加强挪威的安全、而毫不损害挪威利益的苏联建议则获得了日益增加的同情。
