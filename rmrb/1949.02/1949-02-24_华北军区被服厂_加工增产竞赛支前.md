Editor's note: The enthusiasm of the workers is very valuable. The increase in the production of single-layer clothing is a significant achievement. However, if only the increase in quantity is emphasized while neglecting quality and disregarding the health of the workers, the competition may have adverse consequences.

　　【Taihang Electric】After seeing the news of the victory of the liberation of Tianjin and Beijing in the newspapers, all the staff and workers of Factory No. 1 of the Second Clothing Bureau of the Supply Department of the North China Military Region were extremely excited and spontaneously launched a "processing and production increase to support the front" campaign. The total output of the entire factory in mid-January exceeded that of the first ten days of the month by 30 percent. Sewing workers Guo Zhenghong, Li Shouyuan, and others climbed onto their machines before the wake-up bell rang. Tailoring workers Zhang Milu, Cao Mingchang, and Li Wanzai competed to work. Zhang Milu and Cao Mingchang got up before dawn, and Li Wanzai got up even earlier, cutting seventy trouser pieces before it was light. Three ironing apprentices in Group Seven challenged each other. Feng Yushuo ironed and folded 110 single-layer trouser pockets in less than three hours, which was one-third higher than usual. Li Yongxin also ironed 120 collars in the same amount of time. Comrades from the factory department inspected the workshops and saw Li Yongxin taking off his cotton-padded jacket to compete with others in the freezing weather. The tables and machines in the workshops were particularly busy. The factory department put forward the slogan "Complete the task ahead of schedule and strive to be a hero" amidst the workers' intense work. This further stimulated the workers' production enthusiasm. In the past, it took fourteen workers in the tailoring group forty minutes to carry one hundred bundles of cloth from the dyeing workshop. After hearing the call from the higher authorities, they all ran, shouting the slogan "Seize the bunker." The same number of people carried 106 bundles of cloth back to the workshop in less than twenty minutes. Guo Zhenghong, Lian Zhongfu, Li Linzhou, Wang Deyi, and others in the machine group increased their daily output of single-layer military jackets (excluding sleeves) from 35 pieces to 40 pieces. Wang Shouai and Wang Baolin also increased their daily output from 40 pieces to 45 pieces. Li Shouyuan achieved the highest record of 50 pieces per day. With everyone's early and late efforts, the entire factory completed 8,570 pieces of single-layer clothing in mid-January, exceeding the output of the first ten days of the month by 30 percent. The output of Group Four was even higher. In twenty days, each machine averaged fifteen sets per day.

　　华北军区被服厂
  　加工增产竞赛支前
    编者按：工人的情绪很可宝贵，单衣的产量提高，是很大的成绩，但如只重视数量提高而忽视质量，又不顾工人健康，那么竞赛就可能产生不良后果。
    【太行电】华北军区供给部被服二局一厂全体职工，从报上看到解放平津的胜利消息后，兴奋异常，自动地掀起了“加工增产支援前线”运动。全厂一月中旬总产量超过上旬百分之三十。缝工郭正洪、李守元等，在未打起床钟以前就爬上机器。裁剪工人张米路、曹明昌、李万仔等三个人比赛干活，张米路、曹明昌天不明即起床，李万仔起的更早，裁了七十条裤片子才发亮。七组三个熨斗学徒，自行挑战，冯玉锁不到三个钟头即熨折了一百一十条单裤的口袋，较平时提高三分之一。李永新也在同样时间内熨好了一百二十条领子。厂部同志巡视工房，见李永新在三九天脱掉棉衣与别人竞赛。工房内案子上、机器上都显得特别紧张。厂部在职工的紧张工作中提出：“提前完成任务，争取当英雄”的口号。这更兴奋了工人们的生产热情，以往裁工组十四个人从染坊扛一百捆布须四十分钟，听了上级号召后，都是跑步，喊着“抢碉堡”的口号，同样人数不到二十分钟，将一百零六捆布扛回工房。机器组郭正洪、连钟福、李临宙、王德义等轧单军衣褂子（袖除外），均由日产三十五件增至四十件。王守爱、王保林也由日产四十件增至四十五件。李守元则达到了日产五十件的最高纪录。在大家起早搭黑积极努力下，一月中旬全厂完成了八千五百七十件单衣，超过上旬产量百分之三十。四组产量更高，二十天中，每架机子平均日产十五套。
