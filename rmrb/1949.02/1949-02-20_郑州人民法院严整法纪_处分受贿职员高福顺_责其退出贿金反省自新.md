Xinhua News Agency, Zhengzhou, 17th. The Zhengzhou People's Court has strictly enforced law and discipline and disciplined Gao Fushun, a retained bailiff, for taking advantage of his position to extort and accept bribes. Gao Fushun, 59 years old, worked as a court police officer in the Kuomintang reactionary government's court for nearly 40 years and was deeply infected with the "Kuomintang style" of corruption and extortion. After the liberation of Zhengzhou, he registered with the People's Court, expressing his willingness to serve the people. The People's Court, based on its lenient policy, retained him as a bailiff, preparing to educate and reform him. However, Gao Fushun did not think about repenting and, on the third day of serving in the court, relapsed into his old ways and began to extort and accept bribes. On December 1st of last year, when he was ordered to summon Yan Zihe, the deputy manager of the Zhengzhou Hechang Commercial Bank, he cocked his feet and pointed to his body, saying, "The snow is so heavy today, and the streets are really difficult to walk on. My shoes and clothes are all wet," hinting that he wanted some money. Yan Zihe then gave him 40 Zhongzhou currency. He extorted a total of 120 yuan from Yan Zihe in three consecutive times. On another occasion when he went to summon a case, he successively extorted 340 yuan from someone. In order to finally reform Gao Fushun, the People's Court held a meeting on the 16th of last month for all staff to oppose the Kuomintang's ideology and work style, exposing Gao Fushun's illegal behavior and using it to educate other staff members. At the meeting, Gao Fushun publicly reflected on the various facts of how he had extorted and accepted bribes. Since the liberation of Zhengzhou, he had accepted bribes on 31 occasions, totaling more than 3,000 Zhongzhou currency. After his self-reflection, Wang Zhenhua, an administrative section cadre who had worked in the Kuomintang government, said, "Today we eat the food of the common people and wear the clothes of the common people. We must do good things for the common people, and we must get rid of the bad habits left to us by the Kuomintang." When discussing how to deal with Gao Fushun, the attendees vied to speak. Finally, the court authorities, based on everyone's opinions, decided to continue to follow the principle of reform, transferring Gao Fushun from fieldwork to clerical work to help him reflect and reform himself; at the same time, he was ordered to return all the bribe money he had obtained, and he himself wrote a letter asking the original owners to come to the court to retrieve it, in order to demonstrate the laws and disciplines of the People's Government.

　　郑州人民法院严整法纪
  　处分受贿职员高福顺
    责其退出贿金反省自新
    【新华社郑州十七日电】郑州市人民法院留用执达员高福顺，利用职务便利，进行敲诈受贿，已受到革命纪律的制裁。高福顺现年五十九岁，在国民党反动政府的法院中干了近四十年的法警，深染贪污敲诈的“国民党作风”。郑州解放后，他到人民法院登记，表示愿意为人民服务。人民法院本宽大方针，留用他为执达员，准备加以教育改造。但高福顺不思悔过，到院服务第三天，即故态复萌，开始敲诈受贿。去年十二月一日，他奉命去传郑市和昌商行副经理阎子和时，竟翘着脚并指着身上说：“天下这么大的雪，街上真难走，鞋和衣服都湿了。”暗示人家要给他几个钱。阎子和也就给了他中州币四十元。他在阎子和那里连续三次共敲诈了一百二十元。另有一次他去传案，又先后敲诈了人家三百四十元。人民法院为了最后改造高福顺，乃于上月十六日召集全体人员举行反对国民党的思想作风大会，揭发高福顺的违法行为，并借此教育其他工作人员。会上，高福顺当众反省了他如何敲诈受贿的种种事实。自郑州解放以来，他前后受贿三十一起，共计中州币三千余元。在他反省之后，曾在国民党政府做事的行政科干部王真化说：“今天我们是吃老百姓、穿老百姓的。我们要给老百姓办好事，必须革除过去国民党留给我们的恶劣作风。”在讨论到处理高福顺的办法时，到会人员争着发言。最后，法院当局根据大家意见，决定仍本改造方针，将高福顺由外勤调为内勤工作，以帮助他反省自新；同时又责令他将得到的所有贿金退出，并由他本人写信请原主来法院领回，以彰人民政府的法纪。
