Xinhua News Agency, Tianjin, February 4th: Due to thorough policy and discipline education conducted within the troops beforehand, the People's Liberation Army, after entering Tianjin, maintained strict discipline from top to bottom, which the people of Tianjin have widely praised. When a certain assault force crossed the moat, everyone's clothes were soaked with icy mud, but no one went to replace them with the enemy's abandoned cotton uniforms. When a certain unit was guarding a warehouse, because the grain had not yet been delivered, the troops had no food to eat. They endured their hunger, and no one touched the white flour or canned goods in the warehouse. When the first company of a certain regiment rushed into the headquarters of the enemy's 62nd Army, watches and gold ornaments were on the table, and the rice in the pot was still steaming, but the soldiers, except for searching for the enemy, touched nothing. Wang Rongxing, a soldier of the Sixth Company of the "Fuzhou" unit, saw a large package on the road while on sentry duty. He stood guard and watched it, and shifts rotated to keep an eye on it. When no one came to claim it by dawn, it was handed over to the company headquarters. The Second Platoon of the Fourth Company of the Security Camp passed through a building. There was no one inside, and a watch was on the table. After the entire platoon passed, the watch was still on the table. Hu Fengxiang, a squad leader of a certain company, always liked to drink alcohol. He took a bottle of wine and prepared to drink, but thinking that "drinking one mouthful would violate the discipline of the entire army," he immediately poured the wine he had poured out back into the bottle. A certain unit requisitioned a car to transport prisoners and drove it away on its own, but immediately returned it to the Military Control Commission in accordance with orders. When they first entered the city, because the currency value was not fixed, many troops endured the cold and did not buy firewood for heating until the authorities decided on the currency value and then bought firewood at the set price. The people of Tianjin are spreading these model deeds of not violating the slightest interests of the people everywhere. Some old women even burned incense and prostrated themselves to welcome the People's Liberation Army, saying, "With such a good army, dawn has finally broken!" The excellent discipline of the People's Liberation Army in Tianjin demonstrates the essence of a people's army. One reason for this is that policy education and discipline education were carried out from top to bottom before the battle, which improved the soldiers' consciousness in abiding by discipline. In almost all units, in launching the campaign to perform meritorious service for the people, they all listed abiding by discipline as a major item in the meritorious service plan. Many cadres and soldiers stated in their meritorious service plans their determination to "enter empty-handed and leave empty-handed." Some units conducted reviews in light of individual past violations of discipline, thereby further thoroughly eliminating the erroneous idea of ​​"making a fortune." Many companies, with the soldiers' committee as the main body, organized discipline inspection teams, and the soldiers encouraged and supervised each other to ensure that they would not violate discipline.

　　天津我军纪律严明
    人民纷纷传诵赞扬
    【新华社天津四日电】由于部队内部事先进行了深入的政策和纪律教育，人民解放军进入天津后，全军上下，纪律严明，天津人民，纷纷传诵。某突击部队在冲过护城河时，大家的衣服都被冰水泥泞所浸透，但没有一人去更换敌军所遗弃的棉衣。某部在看守仓库时，因粮食未送到，部队没有吃饭，他们忍着饥饿，没有一人去动仓里的白面与罐头。某团一连冲进敌六十二军军部时，桌上摆着手表和金饰等物品，锅里面的大米饭正发着热气，但战士们除搜捕了敌人外，什么也没有动。“福州”部六连战士王荣兴站岗时，看见马路上一个大包袱，一边站岗，一边看着，并且一班一班的轮下去，天亮了没人来认取，才交到连部。警务营四连二排，通过一所楼房，屋里没有人，桌上放着一个手表，全排过完了，表还在桌子上。某连班长胡凤祥向来欢喜喝酒，他拿到一瓶酒准备喝，因想到“自己喝一口酒，就破坏全军纪律”，立即又把已经斟出来的酒倒回瓶里去了。某部因运送俘虏而自行开走一辆汽车，事后立即遵令交还军管会。初入城时因币值未定，许多部队都忍着寒冻，没有买柴取暖，直到上级决定币值后才按价购柴。天津人民到处传诵着这些秋毫无犯的模范事迹，有些老太太们甚至焚香顶礼来接待解放军，并且说：“有了这样好的军队，从此天亮了！”解放军在天津的良好纪律，表现了人民军队的本质，原因之一是在作战以前进行了自上而下的政策教育和纪律教育，提高了战士遵守纪律的自觉性。几乎所有部队在发动为人民立功运动中，都把遵守纪律列为立功计划中的主要项目，许多干部与战士都在立功计划中表明了“空手进去空手出”的决心。某些部队联系过去个别违犯纪律的事实进行检讨，从而进一步彻底肃清“发洋财”的错误思想。许多连队更以士兵委员会为主体组织了纪律检查组，士兵们相互鼓励，相互督促，保证不犯纪律。
