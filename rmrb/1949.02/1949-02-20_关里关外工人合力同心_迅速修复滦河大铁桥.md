　　【Jidong Telegram】The Luan River Iron Bridge and Jinxi River Iron Bridge in the central section of the Beining Railway, which were damaged by Chiang Kai-shek's bandits, were repaired and opened to traffic on the 22nd and 23rd of last month respectively, thanks to the workers' active efforts. When the repair of the Luan River Iron Bridge (old bridge) began, railway workers entering the Pass joined forces with workers from the Tangshan Railway Engineering Section, Machinery Factory, Kailuan Mine, Qixin Company, and other units to participate in the repair work. For more than a month, they never stopped working in the cold winter nights and during the New Year holidays, and finally completed the task victoriously on the 23rd. The "New Beiping" locomotive manufactured by Shenyang workers has passed through the bridge and arrived in Tangshan. When the Tangshan Railway Engineering Section repaired the bridge, it mobilized almost all its workers to rush the repair. After the victory of the liberation of Tianjin came, the workers of the section rushed to repair the Jinxi River Iron Bridge on the 17th. The workers set off at 4:30 every morning, sometimes not returning to Tangshan until 2:00 at night, resting for less than three hours before setting off again. Under such hard work, the old Jinxi River Bridge was repaired and opened to traffic on the 22nd. Now trains from outside the Pass can directly reach Beitang Station.

　　关里关外工人合力同心
  　迅速修复滦河大铁桥
    【冀东电】北宁路中段遭受蒋匪破坏的滦河铁桥及金溪河铁桥，在工人积极赶修下，已于上月二十二、二十三两日分别修复，开始通车。在起修滦河铁桥（旧桥）时，进关的铁路工人协同唐山铁路工务设、机厂、开滦矿、启新公司等处工人，一起参加了修复工作，一个多月来，在寒冷的冬夜，在新年放假期间，都从未停工，终于二十三日胜利完工。沈阳工人所修造的“新北平”号机车已通过该桥抵达唐山。唐山铁路工务段在修复该桥时，几乎出动了全部工人参加赶修，解放天津的胜利消息传来后，该段工人于十七日赶修金溪河铁桥。工人们每天清晨四时半出发，有时到夜里两点才回唐山，休息不到三个钟头，就又出发。在此种艰苦努力下，金溪河旧桥已于二十二日修复通车。现自关外开来的火车已可直达北塘车站。
