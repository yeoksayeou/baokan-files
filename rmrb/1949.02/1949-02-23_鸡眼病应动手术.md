Corns Should Be Surgically Removed
To the Editor:
    Recently, many comrades have been found to have a disease on their feet, which the common people call "foot corns." This disease is characterized by a "corn" growing on the foot, some large and some small, and quite deep. It is very painful if touched by anything. It makes walking difficult. According to some doctors, the treatment for this disease is to cut it out with a knife, but this does not eradicate it. Cutting it out can last for three or four months, but then it grows back and needs to be treated in the same way. I don't quite understand the cause of this disease. Is there a way to eradicate it? Hoping for a reply.

Answer: A corn is a disease caused by continuous stimulation of a part of the body by a foreign object. It often occurs on the feet, especially when shoes are the wrong size or the soles are uneven. The size of the condition varies, usually about the size of a pea, with a very hard fibrous tissue that reaches deep into the flesh. Although there are treatments such as corrosion and cauterization, the most thorough method is surgical removal. However, during the surgical removal, it must be completely removed and then stitched up. It will probably heal in about a week. Prevention: Before walking, check whether the shoes and socks are rubbing. Wash your feet after a long walk to avoid it.

### 鸡眼病应动手术

　　鸡眼病应动手术编辑同志：
    最近发现许多同志的脚上有一种病，老百姓说是“脚挤眼”。此病是脚上长一个眼，有大的，也有小的，并且还很深，如遇外界任何东西碰着，就感到非常疼。行动困难。据有的医生同志谈，此病的治疗法就是用刀割，可是也是除不了根。割一次可顶三四个月，后又重长出来，还需要同样方法治疗。我对此病发生的原因不很了解，是否有除根的治疗办法呢？希答复。

    答：鸡眼是身体的某部持续地受异物刺激而生的一种疾病，常发生于脚，尤其是鞋子大小不适及鞋底不平时，更易发生。病状大小不一，通常为豌豆大，有很硬的纤维组织，深达于肉中。虽有腐蚀及烧灼等治疗法，而最彻底的还是割治，不过在割治（手术）时，须彻底的把它完全取出，然后缝上。大概有一星期左右即可痊愈。预防法：是行路前，检查鞋袜是否磨脚，长途行路后洗脚，便可避免。
