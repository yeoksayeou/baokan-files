Central Hebei Electric Dispatch: Under the support of the democratic government, the production of saltpeter in the Central Hebei region has achieved remarkable results, ensuring the supply of raw materials for military industry. Thirty-six counties and cities in the region are now producing saltpeter. In order to provide planned leadership, the Administrative Office has established a Saltpeter Administration Bureau, dividing the region into five saltpeter producing areas, each with an office. Due to the uneven development of the saltpeter industry, thirteen counties have established county-level Saltpeter Administration Bureaus, while the remaining twenty-three counties have established saltpeter departments under the leadership of the county Production Promotion Cooperatives. In total, there are more than 400 saltpeter industry workers in the region. To facilitate the masses in delivering saltpeter and save time, a total of eighty-four saltpeter collection stalls have been set up throughout the region. According to statistics from various counties and cities at the end of December, there are 1,207 saltpeter producing villages, 21,922 saltpeter producing households, and 2,278 professional saltpeter workers. Compared with the first half of the year, the number of newly added saltpeter producing villages is 352, and the number of saltpeter producing households is 1,089. Compared with 1937, the number of saltpeter producing villages has increased by 725, and the number of saltpeter producing households has increased by 10,336. Due to the increase in the number of saltpeter producing villages and households, the output of saltpeter has increased unprecedentedly, and the quality has also improved. First-class saltpeter accounts for an average of over 85%, most of the remainder is second-class saltpeter, and very little is third-class saltpeter. The following experiences have been gained in mobilizing and organizing the masses to boil saltpeter: 1. Pay attention to opening up new saltpeter producing areas, widely publicize the benefits and importance of boiling saltpeter to the masses, which can not only enrich their families but also ensure raw materials for military industry and support the war. It is even more important to seize the fact that saltpeter producers benefit from boiling saltpeter and carry out in-depth and extensive publicity to inspire the enthusiasm of the masses for boiling saltpeter. 2. Widely use the method of leading saltpeter producers to solve the difficulty of lacking saltpeter boiling technology. In the old saltpeter producing areas, new saltpeter producers are generally led by old saltpeter producers, and this method has played a great role. Wen'an even used the method of exchanging workers, allowing new saltpeter producing groups to send one person to the old saltpeter producing groups to produce and learn technology at the same time, and the old saltpeter producing groups sent one person to the new saltpeter producing groups to produce and teach technology at the same time, which had a great effect. When opening up new saltpeter producing areas, a large number of saltpeter workers were transferred and used to lead the masses to boil saltpeter. Qingyuan and Wen'an also adopted methods such as inviting saltpeter experts to visit through social relations to promote saltpeter boiling, which solved the difficulty of lacking saltpeter boiling technology in new saltpeter producing areas. 3. Saltpeter work cadres should learn saltpeter boiling technology and personally start, break through a point, and educate the masses through facts. For example, in Qiongli Village, Wuan Fifth District, when they first started mobilizing to boil saltpeter, the masses had no confidence and were afraid of wasting firewood and not being able to boil saltpeter. The saltpeter work cadres personally swept four baskets of soil and boiled more than two catties of saltpeter billets and more than one catty of salt, which dispelled the concerns of the masses and they began to boil saltpeter. 4. The transfer of saltpeter workers should be planned, and the situation of saltpeter workers in the new saltpeter producing areas should be understood to prevent blindness. It is necessary to solve the difficulties for saltpeter workers to go to the new saltpeter producing areas and emphasize leading the local masses. Saltpeter workers must go to other villages to boil saltpeter on a voluntary basis. 5. In order to improve the quality of saltpeter, it is necessary to strictly grade it, and at the same time, appropriately increase the price of first-class saltpeter. It is also necessary to educate saltpeter producers politically and explain the significance of boiling saltpeter.

　　冀中火硝业空前发展
  　产硝村超过战前两倍
    【冀中电】在民主政府的扶植下，冀中区火硝生产已获显著成绩，保证了军工原料的供给。全区已有三十六个县市产硝。为了有计划的领导，行署建立了火硝管理局，把全区划为五个产硝区，各硝区设办事处。由于火硝业发展不平衡，有十三个县建立了县火硝管理局，其余廿三个县，则在县生产推进社领导下成立了火硝部。总计全区共有硝业工作人员四百多个。为了便利群众交硝，节省时间，全区共设了八十四个收硝摊。据十二月底各县市的统计，产硝村达一千二百零七个，硝民二万一千九百二十二人，专业硝工二千二百七十八人。以目前情况与上半年相比，新增加之产硝村为三百五十二个，硝民一千零八十九人。如与民国二十六年相比则增多了产硝村七百二十五个，硝民一万零三百三十六人。由于产硝村和硝民的增多，硝的产量空前增多，质量也提高了。一等硝平均占百分之八十五以上，其余大部是二等硝，三等硝极少。在发动和组织群众熬硝当中，得到以下几点经验：一、注意开辟新的硝区，广泛的向群众宣传熬硝的好处和重要性，既可以发家致富，又可以保证军工原料，支援战争。更抓住硝民熬硝得利的事实，进行深入广泛的宣传，启发群众熬硝热情。二、广泛使用带动硝民的办法，解决缺乏熬硝技术的困难。在老的硝区，一般都经过老硝民带动新硝民，这个办法起作用很大。文安更用拨换工的办法，让新硝民组派一人到老硝民组，一面生产一面学技术，老硝民组又派一人到新硝民组一面生产一面教技术，作用很大。开辟新的硝区时，更大量调剂使用了硝工，带动群众熬硝。清苑、文安还采取了通过社会关系，请熬硝把式参观等办法来推广熬硝。解决了新硝区缺乏熬硝技术的困难。三、硝业工作干部学会熬硝技术，亲自下手，突破一点，通过事实宣传教育群众。如文安五区邛里村，开始发动熬硝时，群众没有信心怕白费柴火，熬不出硝来，硝业干部，就亲自扫了四筐土，熬出了二斤多硝坯子，一斤多盐，这样一来，打破了群众的顾虑，开始熬硝。四、调剂硝工要有计划，了解新硝区硝工情况，防止盲目。要解决硝工到新硝区去的困难，并强调带动当地群众。硝工出村熬硝，一定根据自愿。五、为了提高火硝的质量，要严格分等，同时要适当提高头等硝的价格。并要从政治上教育硝民，说明熬硝的重大意义。
