Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 5th: The San Min Chu I Comrades Association issued the following statement on the current situation on January 27th:

The San Min Chu I Comrades Association, in order to strive for genuine democratic peace and oppose false and reactionary peace, and to call on revolutionary followers of the Three Principles of the People to adhere to the three principles of anti-imperialism, anti-feudalism, and anti-bureaucrat capitalism, and to carry the revolution through to the end, hereby issues the following statement:

Today, as the Chinese People's Democratic Revolution approaches complete victory, and as the Nanjing reactionary regime is about to collapse, the number one war criminal who brings calamity to the country and the people, the traitor to the revolutionary Three Principles of the People, Chiang Kai-shek, shamelessly made a gesture of seeking peace in his New Year's Day broadcast, proposing conditions such as preserving the false constitution, false legal system, and reactionary army, which are absolutely intolerable to the people of the whole country. On the one hand, he wants to lightly push the responsibility for the war onto the Chinese Communist Party in an attempt to confuse the public, and on the other hand, he wants to take this opportunity to gain breathing space in order to make a comeback and eliminate the revolution. Chiang Kai-shek also boasted in his broadcast that he would "deal with the Communist Party to the end." Only twenty days later, he left in a very ambiguous manner under the guise of "retirement," but in reality, he is still plotting and commanding behind the scenes. In addition, the puppet Ministry of Foreign Affairs formally requested the Four Powers to mediate, the puppet Executive Yuan and the puppet Central Political Committee made resolutions on "unconditionally ceasing fire first and appointing representatives for peace talks," and sent peace talk representatives, etc. All these activities are nothing more than making a gesture of seeking peace, attempting to maintain the remaining forces of the Nanjing reactionary regime, so that the Chinese people's democratic cause will fall short of success and fail to achieve complete success.

At the same time, we must recognize that behind the peace conspiracy launched by Chiang Kai-shek and his reactionary group, there is also the instruction of US imperialism. US imperialism and all other imperialists are extremely afraid of the success of the Chinese revolution, and it will use all its strength to sabotage the Chinese revolution. This kind of thing has been seen many times in the history of the Chinese revolutionary movement. The current US policy towards China is very clear: on the one hand, it directs a peace offensive and supports local feudal forces, doing everything possible to maintain the remaining forces of the reactionary regime; on the other hand, it attempts to instigate and organize so-called "opposition parties" in the democratic camp to sabotage the Chinese revolution. This is a further development of the peace conspiracy. Its attempt to sabotage the Chinese revolution is the same. Under the supreme principle of New Democracy, the so-called "opposition party" is not allowed to exist at all. The so-called "opposition party" that opposes the basic principles of the revolution is essentially no different from the "reactionary party." Now the US has indeed begun to carry out this work, which we cannot but be very vigilant about. As for the Nanjing reactionary regime's openly requesting the Four Powers to interfere in China's internal affairs, it is very shameful. In addition to the Soviet Union's open and solemn statement rejecting mediation, although it is rumored that the United States, Britain, and France have also rejected mediation, the nature of the imperialists is that they want to use force to hinder the Chinese revolution at all times and in all places. We resolutely oppose to the end the shameless behavior of the Nanjing reactionary regime in seeking imperialist intervention!

Just as the sinister fog of the US-Chiang peace offensive shrouded us, Mr. Mao Zedong, Chairman of the Central Committee of the Chinese Communist Party and leader of the Chinese people, issued an extremely solemn statement, proposing eight conditions for genuine democratic peace. It can be said that it truly represents the public opinion of the people of the whole country. None of these eight conditions are not what the people of the whole country demand. Is it not necessary to punish war criminals? Is it not necessary to abolish the false constitution and false legal system? Is it not necessary to reorganize all reactionary troops? Is it not necessary to confiscate bureaucratic capital? Is it not necessary to reform the land system? Is it not necessary to abolish traitorous treaties? Can the new Political Consultative Conference and the coalition government still allow reactionary elements to participate? These eight conditions can be said to be the most reasonable and fair conditions. We revolutionary followers of the Three Principles of the People should unite and use all our strength to force the "Nanjing reactionary government and any other local governments and military groups" to quickly accept these eight conditions to show their sincerity for peace talks, and there is no room for negotiation. We are pleased that Mr. Mao has proposed these eight conditions to promote genuine democratic peace. At the same time, we believe that the CCP and all democratic parties, groups, and democrats will certainly insist on the realization of these eight conditions.

Due to the lessons of the successive failures of the Revolution of 1911 and the Northern Expedition, we should fully understand that imperialist sabotage and our own compromise and wavering are the biggest obstacles to the Chinese revolution. The current situation is already very clear. China must unswervingly and uncompromisingly insist on thoroughly overthrowing imperialism, feudalism, and bureaucratic capitalism, and overthrowing the entire rule of the Nanjing reactionary regime, and must not allow the existence of even a trace of feudal remnants. At the same time, we must recognize that the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party is the greatest guarantee for the complete victory of the Chinese revolution. We must also recognize that New Democracy is the supreme guiding principle for the current stage of the Chinese revolution. We revolutionary followers of the Three Principles of the People believe that the content of the revolutionary Three Principles of the People and New Democracy should be consistent. Therefore, this association calls on our revolutionary followers of the Three Principles of the People to recognize the current situation, seek a way to contribute to the Chinese revolution, oppose false and reactionary peace, strive for genuine democratic peace, adhere to the three principles of anti-imperialism, anti-feudalism, and anti-bureaucrat capitalism, and strive to completely complete the Chinese People's Democratic Revolution.

### 三民主义同志联合会声明　坚持实现毛主席主张

　　三民主义同志联合会声明
  　坚持实现毛主席主张
    【新华社陕北五日电】三民主义同志联合会于一月二十七日发表对时局声明如下：
    三民主义同志联合会为争取真正的民主的和平，反对虚伪的反动的和平，并号召革命的三民主义者坚持反帝、反封建、反官僚资本三原则，将革命进行到底，特发表声明如下：
    当兹中国人民民主革命迫近全面胜利的今天，亦即南京反动政权行将崩溃瓦解的今天，祸国殃民的第一名战犯、革命的三民主义叛逆蒋介石竟恬不知耻的在元旦广播中作出求和的姿态，提出了保存伪宪法、伪法统及反动军队等项为全国人民绝所不能容忍的条件。一方面想将战争责任轻轻地推在中国共产党身上，以图迷惑一般人们的视听，另方面想借此取得喘息时间，以便卷土重来，消灭减革命。蒋逆在广播中还自夸要“与共党周旋到底”。事隔仅仅二十天，他竟又以“引退”为名，非常暖昧的出走，而实际仍在幕后策动指挥。此外，如伪外交部正式请求四强调停，伪行政院及伪中政会关于“先行无条件停战，并各指定代表进行和谈”的决议，以及派遣和谈代表等等，这一切一切的活动，都无非是作出一种求和的姿态，企图保持南京反动政权的残余势力，使中国人民民主功亏一篑，不能获得彻底的成功。
    同时，我们必须认识蒋逆及其反动集团所发动的和平阴谋背后，还有美帝国主义的指示。美帝与其他一切帝国主义者莫不十分恐惧中国革命的成功，它必将用一切力量来破坏中国革命。这种事例，在中国革命运动史上已屡见不鲜。美帝今日之对华政策至为明显：一方面主使和平攻势，并扶助地方封建势力，尽一切可能来保持反动政权的残余势力；另方面企图在民主阵营中策动组织所谓“反对派”，进行破坏中国革命。这是和平阴谋进一步的发展。其破坏中国革命的企图是并无二致的。在新民主主义的最高原则下，所谓“反对派”根本就不容许存在，反对革命基本原则的所谓“反对派”，实质上就与“反动派”无异。现在美帝确已开始进行这项工作，是我们不能不十分警觉的。至于南京反动政权公然要求四强干涉中国内政，是非常可耻的。除了苏联已公开严正声明，拒绝调停外，美英法虽传说亦已拒绝调停，但帝国主义者的本质，是无时无地不想用力量来阻挠中国革命的。我们对南京反动政权求帝国主义干涉的无耻行为，坚决反对到底！
    正在美蒋和平攻势阴雾笼罩之下，中国人民的领袖中共中央主席毛泽东先生发表了极严正的声明，提出真正的民主的和平八个条件。可以说真正代表了全国人民的公意。这八个条件，没有一条不是全国人民所要求的。难道战争罪犯不需要惩办？难道伪宪法伪法统不需要废除？难道一切反动军队不需要改编？难道官僚资本不需要被没收？难道土地制度不需要改革？难道卖国条约不需要废除？难道新政协和联合政府还能让反动分子参加？这八个条件，可以说是最合理最公平的条件。我们革命的三民主义者应该一致起来，用全力压迫“南京反动政府及其他任何地方政府与军事集团”都迅速接受这八个条件，以表示他们对于和谈的诚意，决没有什么磋商的余地。我们对于毛先生为促使真正的民主的和平提出这样八个条件，表示欣慰。同时我们相信，中共及一切民主党派团体和民主人士，必然坚持这八个条件的实现。
    由于辛亥革命和北伐历次的失败的教训，我们应该充分了解帝国主义的破坏和我们自己的妥协动摇，是中国革命的最大障碍。今天的局势，已经非常清楚。中国必须毫不动摇妥协的坚持彻底的打倒帝国主义、打倒封建主义、打倒官僚资本主义、推翻南京反动政权整个统治，决不容许有一丝一毫封建残余势力的存在。同时，我们必须确认中国共产党的领导，是中国革命彻底胜利的最大保证。我们也必须确认新民主主义为现阶段中国革命的最高指针。我们革命的三民主义者认为革命的三民主义与新民主主义的内容应当一致。因此本会号召我们革命的三民主义者，认清当前局势，谋取对于中国革命供献力量的道路，反对虚伪的反动的和平，争取真正的民主的和平，坚持反帝反封建反官僚资本三大原则，为彻底完成中国人民民主革命而努力。
