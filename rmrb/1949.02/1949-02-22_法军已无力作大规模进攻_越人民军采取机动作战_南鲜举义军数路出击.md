Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 20th. According to a Điện Tín Xã dispatch on the 14th: A recent communiqué issued by the Vietnamese People's Army points out that the French troops, since December of last year, have been unable to launch any large-scale operations. The communiqué stated: The Vietnamese People's Army has adopted mobile tactics, turning the enemy's rear into the front line. The communiqué pointed out that under the pressure of the people's strength, the Vietnamese puppet military and political personnel cultivated by French imperialism are increasingly wavering. The communiqué stated: The puppet authorities of Thừa Thiên Province (transliteration) in central Vietnam, in a report to the French colonial authorities stationed in Hanoi, stated: "The activities of the troops stationed at various strongholds have decreased significantly, and morale is extremely low. Numerous patrols are constantly being disarmed by small groups of guerrillas. The guerrilla attacks are not met with resistance. In various villages, there are frequent mass demonstrations. The troops stationed nearby have not interfered in the slightest. Many administrative personnel (referring to puppet personnel) have resigned." Due to this situation, the number of puppet soldiers defecting to the People's Army is increasing daily.
Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 20th. TASS, Pyongyang Dispatch: In the first half of February, in South Korea's Jeolla Namdo province, units of the Uprising Army attacked puppet troops and police in four counties including Goheung (southern Jeolla Namdo) and Gokseong (northern Jeolla Namdo). In Haenam County, on the southwest coast of Jeolla Namdo, armed farmers attacked a puppet police detachment. In Jeolla Bukdo, Uprising Army units joined the guerrillas and together occupied the highlands of Jinan and Gimje areas near Jeonju. The Uprising Army is also expanding its area of operations in counties such as Geumsan (northern Jeolla Bukdo). On Jeju Island, the People's Armed Forces are inflicting heavy blows on the puppet troops. In the area of Dicheon (transliteration) on the island, near Hanro (transliteration) city, the People's Armed Forces are fighting with the police.

　　法军已无力作大规模进攻
  　越人民军采取机动作战
    南鲜举义军数路出击
    【新华社陕北二十日电】据电通社十四日讯：越南人民军最近发表的公报指出：法军自去年十二月份起，已无力发动任何大规模的作战。公报称：越人民军采取了机动战术，变敌人的后方为前线。公报指出了在人民力量的压力下，法帝国主义培植的越伪军政人员日益动摇的情况。该公报称：越南中部舒亚辛省（译音）的傀儡当局，在给驻河内法国殖民地当局的报告中称：“驻于各据点的部队的活动，已显著地减少，士气极端低落。人数众多的巡逻队不断被小股游击队解除武装。游击队的袭击，没有遇到抵抗。在各村庄里，经常有群众的示威。驻于附近的部队，却丝毫未予干涉。许多行政人员（指伪人员）已辞职”。由于这种情况，投诚人民军的伪军正日益增多。
    【新华社陕北二十日电】塔斯社平壤讯：二月份上半月，在南朝鲜的全罗南道，举义军的部队曾进击高兴（全罗南道南部）、谷城（全罗南道北部）等四县的傀儡军队与警察。全罗南道西南岸的海南县内，武装农民曾袭击傀儡警察的派遣队。在全罗北道，举义军部队参加了游击队，并一道占领了全州附近镇安、金堤地区的高地。举义军并在锦山（全罗北道北部）等县扩大活动地区。在济州岛，人民武装正予傀儡军队以重大的打击。在该岛狄琛（译音）地区之汉罗（译音）城附近，人民武装正在与警察作战。
