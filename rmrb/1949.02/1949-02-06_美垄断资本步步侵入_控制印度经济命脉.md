Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, February 2nd: Due to the Indian reactionary authorities' consistent policy of relying on imperialism, American monopoly capital is steadily encroaching upon India and, together with British capital, is controlling India's economic lifeline. According to TASS from Delhi: The Indian government gazette states that in the next seven years, the Indian government plans to use 2.71 billion rupees to build irrigation systems, chemical fertilizer factories, and develop fisheries. Among them, 1.25 billion rupees will be paid in US dollars and British pounds. In order to turn India into their agricultural appendage, American and British imperialism are currently focusing on agricultural investment. The Indian "Bharat" newspaper reported that the Indian government hopes to obtain a loan of 2 billion rupees from the International Bank for Reconstruction and Development. Sources in Delhi revealed that this American loan will be issued under the following conditions: that most of the capital is invested in Indian agriculture, rather than in industry. At the same time, India's railway transportation will become more dependent on the United States and Britain. In the next five years, India plans to import railway equipment worth 1 billion rupees from Britain and the United States. The Financial Planning Committee of the Indian Ministry of Finance plans to invest 300 million rupees to establish a "national" navy, and the committee also suggested that British and American banks and shipbuilding companies should have the right to supply half of the total investment. In addition, the construction of automatic telephone traffic in major Indian cities will be undertaken by the British "Automatic Telephone and Electric Company." In the next ten years, the Indian government plans to use 540 million rupees to build civil airports. The main investment will be provided by the United States and Britain, and the construction will be carried out under the supervision of British and American experts. The construction of Indian airports is related to the construction of new military bases and the reorganization of existing military bases by the United States and Britain in Southeast Asian and Middle Eastern countries.

　　美垄断资本步步侵入
    控制印度经济命脉
    【新华社陕北二日电】由于印度反动当局一味采取仰赖帝国主义的政策，美国垄断资本正步步侵入印度，并和英国资本一起控制了印度的经济命脉。据塔斯社自德里报导：印度政府公报称，在今后七年内，印政府拟用二十七亿一千万卢比来建造灌溉系统、化学肥料工厂及发展渔业。其中，十二亿五千万卢比将由美元和英镑来支付。美英帝国主义为使印度全国沦为它们的农业附属国，刻正致力于农业投资。印度“巴拉特”报载称，印度政府希望获得国际建设开发银行二十亿卢比的贷款。德里人士透露，这笔美国贷款将在下述条件下发放，即大部分资本投入印度农业，而不投入工业。与此同时，印度的铁路运输亦将更加依赖于美国和英国，在今后五年内，印度打算自英美输入价值十亿卢比的铁道设备。印度财政部财政计划委员会拟投资三亿卢比建立“国家”海军，该会并建议，英美两国银行及造船公司应有权供给该投资总额的半数。此外，印度各大城市的自动电话交通建设将由英国“自动电话及电气公司”参加。在今后十年内，印度政府计划用五亿四千万卢比修筑民用机场，主要投资将由美英供给，其修筑工作将在英美专家监督下进行。印度机场的修筑，系与美英两国在东南亚与中东国家内建造新军事基地及重整现有军事基地一事有关。
