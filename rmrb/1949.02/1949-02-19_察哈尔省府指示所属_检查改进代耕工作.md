(Zhangjiakou Telegram) The Chahar Provincial Government issued instructions on January 13 regarding doing a good job in the production of military dependents and revolutionary martyrs' families, and effectively improving the work of land tilling on their behalf. The instructions first reviewed the situation of this work in various places. Although land tilling on behalf of others has been carried out in general villages, the system is not sound enough. On the one hand, a lot of manpower is wasted, and on the other hand, the production of military, cadres, and martyrs' families has not been done well. How to organize forces in the future to do a good job in the production of military dependents and revolutionary martyrs' families? The instructions stated: First of all, leading organs at all levels of the Party, government, and people must pay great attention to this work and plan, deploy, and inspect this work in a planned way. Regarding the improvement of land tilling on behalf of others, in addition to educating the masses to recognize the glorious status of military dependents and revolutionary martyrs' families and consciously and voluntarily help the poor military dependents and revolutionary martyrs' families solve their difficulties (but not waste manpower), the following principles are also stipulated: (1) Those with better living conditions and labor at home will not be given land tilling on behalf of others. (2) Those with good living conditions but no labor at home can rent out or hire workers to cultivate, which should not be considered exploitation. (3) Those with difficult living conditions and no labor at home can have part or all of their land tilled on their behalf. As for which family belongs to which category, it should be democratically discussed and decided by the village representative meeting or the villagers' meeting. In addition, based on the experience of implementation, a detailed analysis was made of the advantages and disadvantages of several methods of land tilling on behalf of others currently implemented in various places: 1. Contracted Tilling. Register the military dependents' land to be tilled on behalf of others and what crops are expected to be planted. Based on the distance of the land and the amount of labor required, the amount of labor used is evaluated through public discussion, and then, based on the labor force of the land tiller and the land tilled, the contracted land is uniformly distributed through mutual agreement between the military dependents and the land tiller, and the work is uniformly recorded and calculated. This method is also relatively good because the whole village has a unified plan, which can save labor and prevent the military dependents and revolutionary martyrs' families from developing a mentality of dependence. However, in areas where the work foundation is relatively poor and the conditions for cadres are relatively weak, it is easy to have problems if adopted. 2. Contract System. The villagers' meeting determines the whole or part of the contract for land tilling on behalf of others according to the actual situation of the military dependents and revolutionary martyrs' families. The number of work points for the land is allocated to one or several households for cultivation, and the fertilizers and seeds are borne by the land tiller (in exchange for work points). The land tiller delivers grain to the military dependents and revolutionary martyrs' families in autumn according to the normal annual yield. Except for disasters or other force majeure events, if the harvest is not enough to meet the normal yield, the land tiller is responsible for making up the difference. The amount exceeding the normal yield belongs to the land tiller. Finally, the land tiller is given work points according to the assessed number of work points. This method is best for military dependents and revolutionary martyrs' families who have absolutely no labor. Military dependents with labor can only contract part of the land and should not contract it all out. 3. Dispatching Labor. This is a commonly used method, which can be roughly divided into several types: A. Work Ticket System. The villagers' meeting democratically evaluates the number of acres and work points that need to be tilled on behalf of the military dependents and revolutionary martyrs' families in the village according to the actual situation, and reports it to the district. The district reviews the situation of each village, and approves the number of work points for land tilling on behalf of others in each village after deliberation. Work tickets for land tilling on behalf of others are issued to the military dependents and revolutionary martyrs' families in each village according to the season. The military dependents and revolutionary martyrs' families can request labor from the village with the tickets, and the land tiller can record the work points with the tickets in the village. Each village uses the tickets to tally work points at the transportation station. This method can balance the land tilling on behalf of others in each village and is not easy to waste manpower, but it is still necessary to prevent the land tiller from being passive and lazy, and the cadres from dispatching work unfairly (because land tilling on behalf of others is easier than duty). B. Democratic Evaluation and Cadre Control. The villagers' meeting or the military dependents and revolutionary martyrs' families' meeting democratically discusses and evaluates which families need land tilling on behalf of others and how many work points are needed, and hands it over to the Military Support Committee or the Duty Captain for execution. This method is not easy to prevent the land tiller from being passive and lazy, and the transportation station is not easy to balance the number of work points in each village. Each village often uses this to make trouble with village localism, so this method is best not used. C. In individual villages where the work is not good, only a few cadres control the land tilling on behalf of others, and they can dispatch whoever they want without tallying work points or offsetting work points. This phenomenon must be resolutely corrected. In order to do a good job in this year's land tilling on behalf of others, the instructions require all localities to combine production preparation and winter studies to widely and deeply publicize and deliberate on the above principles and specific practices, in connection with the actual situation of the local area. Seminars for military dependents and revolutionary martyrs' families, cadre meetings, villager representative meetings, and villagers' meetings should be held in a step-by-step manner to discuss and formulate land tilling plans. Then, the production preparation work for this year should be done specifically for each military dependent and revolutionary martyr's family who needs land tilling on behalf of others, and the plan should be implemented as soon as the large-scale production begins. In terms of organizational leadership, the land tilling work in each village can be led by the "Military Support Committee" or the "Land Tilling Committee." The members are composed of relevant cadres from the Party, government, people, and military in the village, as well as representatives of military dependents and revolutionary martyrs' families. Collective leadership, division of labor and responsibility. The district level shall review and approve the number of land tilling on behalf of others in collaboration with the brigade headquarters, and inspect the implementation of each village. At the county level and above, the government's civil affairs department shall lead this work in collaboration with the production department and the people's armed forces department.

　　察哈尔省府指示所属
  　检查改进代耕工作
    【张垣电】察哈尔省政府于一月十三日发出关于做好军干烈属的生产，切实改进代耕工作的指示。指示首先检讨了各地对这一工作进行的情况，一般村庄虽然进行了代耕，但因制度不够健全，一方面民力浪费很多，另一方面军、干、烈属的生产亦未搞好。今后如何组织力量，将军烈属生产作好？该指示称：首先要各级党政民领导机关十分重视，有计划地布置、检查这一工作。关于改进代耕除了必须教育群众认识军干烈属的光荣地位，自觉自愿地帮助穷苦的军干烈属解决困难（但不能浪费民力）外，并规定了如下的原则：（一）家中生活较好又有劳动力的不给代耕。（二）家中生活虽好但无劳动力的，可以自行出租或雇工耕种，这不得认为是剥削。（三）家中生活困难又无劳动力的可以代耕一部或全部。至于谁家算哪一类，应由全村代表会或村民大会民主讨论决定。另外，根据执行的经验对现在各地实行的几种代耕办法的利弊均进行了详细的分析：一、包耕。把军属代耕土地与预计种植何种作物，都登记起来，根据地的远近用工多少，经群众公议评定用工数，然后根据代耕劳动力，采取军属与代耕者双方商定的办法，统一分配包耕土地，并统一记工算工，这种办法也比较好，因为全村统一计划，可以节省劳力，又不致养成军干烈属的依赖心理。不过在工作基础比较差，干部条件比较弱的地区，采用起来却易于发生毛病。二、包干制。由村民大会按军干烈属实际情形，确定其全部或一部包干代耕。土地所顶工数，分配给一户或几户耕种，肥料种子都由代耕者负担（顶工），代耕者按常年应产量，秋后向军干烈属交粮。除因灾荒或其他不可抗的事故外，收获不够应产量时，代耕者要负责补足，超过应产量之数则归代耕者所得，最后按已评定之工数给代耕者顶工。这种办法对绝对无劳动力的军干烈属使用最好，有劳动力的军属，只能包耕一部不应完全包出。三、派工。这是普遍采用的办法，大致又可分为几种：甲、工票制。由各村民大会，按本村军干烈属实际情形，民主评定需要代耕的亩数和工数，汇报到区，由区审查各村情形，斟酌批准各村代耕工数，按季节发给各村军干烈属代耕工票，军干烈属凭票向村要工，代耕者凭票向村记工，各村凭票到交通站齐工。这种办法可以使各村代耕平衡，不易浪费民力，但仍须防止代耕人的消极怠工，和干部派工不公平（因代耕轻于勤务）。乙、民主评定干部掌握。由村民大会或军干烈属大会民主讨论，评定谁家需要代耕及工数多少，交优军委员会或勤务队长执行。这种办法不易防止代耕者的消极怠工，交通站也不易平衡各村工数，各村往往借此闹村本位，因此这种办法最好不用。丙、个别村工作不好，只由少数干部掌握代耕，愿意派谁就派谁，既不齐工，也不顶工，这种现象必须坚决纠正。为了把今年的代耕工作作好，指示中要求各地在目前结合生产准备，冬学把上述原则和具体做法，联系当地的实际情况，进行广泛深入的宣传酝酿，要有步骤的举行军干烈属座谈会、干部会、村民代表会和村民大会，讨论并订定代耕计划。然后按户具体把需要代耕的军干烈属的今年生产准备工作做好，大生产开始即按计划执行。在组织领导上各村代耕工作可由“优军委员会”或“代耕委员会”领导。委员由村中党、政、民、武等有关干部及军干烈属代表组成。集体领导，分工负责。区级由区政府协同大队部审查批准代耕数目，并检查各村执行情形。县级以上由政府民政部门协同生产部门及人民武装部门领导这一工作。
