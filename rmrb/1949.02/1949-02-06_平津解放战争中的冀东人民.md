Jidong Branch

Before the Northeast Army entered the customs to fight, the Party, government, army, and people of the entire Jidong region were universally mobilized. While engaged in production, they also completed various preparatory tasks for war support in a tense manner. As soon as the autumn harvest was over, every household was busy milling public grain. The people of Shunyi County delivered 47% more public grain than originally planned. Other supplies such as firewood, grass, oil, and salt were also quickly concentrated in the supply line granaries. A total of 400,000 carts and 520,000 donkey workers were mobilized. Tens of thousands of carts traveled day and night on the transportation routes, converging from villages and towns hundreds of miles away to the supply lines. To pave the way for the advance, the people of the entire region mobilized to repair bridges and roads. Throughout the 27 counties in the region, there were approximately 6,500 li of arterial highways extending in all directions, along with county roads and branch lines, totaling nearly 10,000 li in length. There were no fewer than 500 bridges of all sizes over rivers, all of which were repaired by mid-December, ensuring unimpeded traffic. Some highways were widened from 2 to 3.6 zhang; others were widened from 1 to 2.2 zhang. The mountainous highway in Xinglong was blasted open with explosives and re-paved. Air-raid shelters, car hiding trenches, and hiding sheds were also widely dug along both sides of various highways. Many women, children, and elderly people also voluntarily participated in road repairs. In the seventh and ninth districts of Changli alone, more than 2,500 women participated in road repairs. More than 250 miners who were newly liberated in Shangzhuang also voluntarily participated in road repairs. The bridge construction work in the border areas such as Wangjiasuo in Xianghe was carried out under the cover of local armed forces, and in constant struggle with the enemy: "When the enemy comes to dismantle the bridge, bury the wood; when the enemy leaves, rebuild." It was repeatedly dismantled and repaired, ensuring that it did not delay the advance and avoided enemy destruction. The bridge-building workers in Baijiawan were bombed and strafed by Chiang Kai-shek's aircraft three times in three days. Five bridge-building workers in Duogezhuang were injured, but they still insisted on rushing to repair the bridge day and night. The Luan River Bridge in Nanzhua Village, Qian'an, was about 100 spans long. Without the assistance of engineering experts, they relied on mutual discussion and research, braving enemy bombing and strafing and the cold of the winter river ice, going into the water to drive piles and rushing to repair it day and night. The work efficiency was increased from driving three rows of piles per day to driving nine and a half rows, and a 100-span bridge capable of carrying 10 tons was completed in ten days. When the masses heard that the government was requisitioning wood for bridge construction, they offered it up voluntarily. Old Granny Liu of Liujiakou in the fourth district of Baodi voluntarily offered two beloved poplar trees, saying, "As long as Chiang Kai-shek is defeated, everything will be easy." When the army entered the customs, the good news spread throughout the region. Women's associations in every town and village organized comfort groups and sewing and washing groups, rushing to make military uniforms and various慰劳品; busy clearing houses and heating kangs; the children's corps also organized reception groups, guides, and horse-leading groups, with clearly defined responsibilities and were very active. Every town and village was like a grand celebration, building arches, decorating with lanterns and streamers, waiting for the People's Liberation Army. When the marching column appeared in every village and town, old grandmothers were holding tea, and women handed慰问袋pre-embroidered with words such as "Kill the enemy and make meritorious service" and "People's Hero" to the dusty soldiers. Some were even looking for heroes and models in the marching column and then pinning glory flowers on their chests. On the marching road, villages were filled with the sound of gongs and drums. Yangko teams shuttled between the marching columns, and the sound of large drums and cymbals, songs, and slogans of the children's corps rose and fell one after another, with thunderous cheers. When the masses shouted the slogan "Salute to the Field Army, wish you victory in Beiping," the soldiers also loudly answered with slogans: "We will definitely answer your demands! Take Beiping and liberate all of North China!" The troops were warmly received and mended clothes in every village they were stationed in. The women took care of the wounded as if they were their own brothers, guarding them all night long, feeding them water and food, and taking out their own money to buy things for the wounded, giving the wounded great comfort and encouragement. The Northeast People's Liberation Army who entered the customs said with emotion: "It's even better than my own home!" They vowed to "kill the enemy and make meritorious service on the front line to repay the elders of Jidong." Many military families wrote letters to their children reporting that the family was living well, telling them to fight the enemy and make meritorious service on the front line with peace of mind.

To do a good job in frontline rescue work, the entire region organized 270 frontline stretcher teams, mobilizing more than 300,000 civilian workers. Many young and middle-aged women in villages also organized rear stretcher teams. Each stretcher was prepared with bedding and pillows; there were also those with white sheets, prepared for air defense in snowy weather. Some brought small ladles to collect urine for the wounded. In addition to collecting and transporting public grain to the supply lines, the entire region transported approximately 20,000 carts of military grain to the front line every day in the past month. As of the end of January, a total of more than 60 million jin of grain, more than 20 million jin of firewood and grass, more than 2 million jin of vegetables, and more than 1.4 million jin of oil and salt were transported to the front line. The granaries quickly improved their work efficiency in the tense work. Those that were supposed to hold 1,000 jin were filled with 1,500 jin. The muleteers who were driving the pack animals also carried grain on their shoulders, saying, "One trip is as good as two."

Thousands upon thousands of rubber-tired carts, handcarts, ox carts, and donkeys passed non-stop on the supply lines... The crowds transporting grain and firewood, facing cold winds and heavy snow, enduring all kinds of hardships, could not stop their progress, nor could they delay the frontline troops' rations. After the army entered the customs, the people in various places launched a labor army movement. In just ten days around the New Year's Day, a total of more than 1 million jin of pork, 6,000 boxes of cigarettes, more than 1,600 jin of leaf tobacco, and a large number of peanuts, chestnuts, and daily necessities were collected and transported to the frontline troops. During the old Spring Festival period, the upsurge of labor army and support for military families in various places is in full swing.

　　平津解放战争中的冀东人民
    公路近万里桥梁五百座
    修好展宽达到畅通无阻
    不怕河冰寒
    下水去打桩
    “答复你们的要求，一定打下北平城！”
    担架上预备好被褥枕头白被单
    冀东分社
    冀东全区党政军民在东北大军入关作战之前，即已普遍地动员起来，一面生产，一面紧张地完成了各项备战支前工作。秋忙刚过，就家家忙着碾公粮。顺义县人民交公粮超过原布置数字的百分之四十七。其他如柴草、油盐，也都很快集中到供应线粮库里去。先后共出动了大车工四十万个，驴工五十二万个。运输道上整日整夜有几万辆大车，从数百里以外的村镇向供应线上集中。为了铺平进军道路，全区人民动员起来修桥补路。全境二十七县内，四通八达的公路干线约六千五百余里，连同县公路、支线，全长近万里。所有河流的大小桥梁不下五百座，截止十二月中旬即已全部修补完竣，畅行无阻。有些公路展宽二丈至三丈六尺；有的展宽一丈至二丈二尺。兴隆山地公路，并用炸药炸开，重新铺修。各公路两旁还普遍地挖了防空洞和汽车隐避壕、隐避棚。许多妇女儿童和老年人，也自动参加修路。昌黎七、九两区参加修路的妇女就有两千五百多人。上庄新获解放的二百五十多名矿工也自动参加了修路工作。香河王家梭等边缘地区的架桥工作，是在地武掩护下，和敌人不断斗争中进行的：“敌来拆桥埋木材，敌走重修”，几次又拆又修，作到既不误进军，又避免敌人的破坏。百家湾修桥民工三天内遭蒋机三次轰炸扫射，朵各庄修桥工人并有五人负伤，但他们仍日夜坚持赶修。迁安南爪村滦河大桥，长约百孔，在没有工程专家的条件下，依靠互相讨论研究，冒着敌机的轰炸扫射和冬季河水流冰的寒冷，下水打桩，昼夜抢修。由每天打三排桩子，提高到打九排半的工作效率，十天内完成载重十吨的百孔大桥一座。群众听说政府征用架桥木材，纷纷自献。宝坻四区六家口刘老大娘自动献出两棵心爱的大杨树，她说：“只要把蒋介石打败，什么事情也好办了。”大军入关，喜讯传遍各地，每一城镇、乡村妇女会组织了慰问组、缝洗组，连夜赶做军装和各种慰劳品；忙着腾房子、烧热炕；儿童团也组织了招待组，带路组，溜马组，分工负责，非常活跃。各城镇乡村象办大喜事一样搭起牌楼，结彩悬灯，等待解放军。当行军行列出现在每一村庄、城镇时，老大娘端着茶水，妇女们把预先加意绣制的带有“杀敌立功”“人民功臣”等字样的慰问袋，送到风尘满面的子弟兵的手里。有的还在进军行列里找寻功臣和英雄，然后把光荣花朵戴在他们的胸前。进军道上，村村锣鼓喧天，秧歌队穿梭般地在进军的行列之间欢扭，大鼓大钹，歌咏队和儿童团的口号声此起彼落，欢声雷动。当群众高呼：“向野战军致敬，祝你们打到北平去”的口号时，战士们也响亮的呼口号回答：“一定答复你们的要求！打下北平城，解放全华北！”部队驻到每个村庄，都得到热情的招待、缝补。妇女们看护伤员，就象看护自家兄弟，整夜守护在旁，喂水、喂饭，拿出自己的钱给伤员买东西吃，给伤员极大的安慰和鼓舞。入关的东北人民解放军感动的说：“比自己的家里还好！”誓言“在火线上杀敌立功，报答冀东父老。”许多军属写信给自己的子弟报告家里生活好，叫他们在前方安心杀敌立功。
    为了做好前线救护工作，全区组织了二百七十个前方担架团，动员民工三十余万人。不少村庄的青壮妇女也组织了后方担架队。每付担架都预备了被褥枕头；还有带白被单的，预备雪天防空。有的带着小瓢给伤员接尿用。全区除向供应线上集运公粮外，最近一月内每日约有二万辆大车向前线赶运军粮。截至一月底，向前方运输粮食共六千余万斤，柴草二千余万斤，蔬菜二百余万斤，油盐一百四十余万斤。各粮库在紧张的工作中迅速的提高了工作效率。该装一千斤的，装一千五百斤。赶驮子的驴夫，肩上也背着粮食，他们说：“一回顶两回。”
    各供应线上川流不息地过着成千成万的胶皮车、手推车、牛车、毛驴驮子、肩担……运粮运柴的人群，寒风大雪、千辛万难，阻止不了他们的前进，也耽误不了前方人马的口粮。大军入关后，各地人民即掀起劳军运动。仅阳历年关十日内，共募集劳军猪肉一百万余斤，香烟六千盒，叶子烟一千六百余斤，及大批的花生、栗子及生活日用品，运给前方部队。旧年春节期中，各地劳军优属热潮，正方兴未艾。
