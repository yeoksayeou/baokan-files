　　【Zhangjiakou Telegram】Longyan Iron Mine workers Xu Hailin and others were rewarded by the People's Government for handing over machinery parts that had been preserved for two years. Two years ago, after our army withdrew from Zhangjiakou and Xuanhua, the mine workers secretly discussed and decided to resolutely not hand over important machine parts to the Kuomintang army. At that time, Xu Hailin and others dismantled four electric meters and a pressure gauge from the water tower, and everyone unanimously elected Xu Hailin to be responsible for their safekeeping. Xu Hailin hid these items in a disused room's water pool, cleverly camouflaging them with wooden boards underneath the pool. It wasn't until Xuanhua was liberated again this time that Xu Hailin took out the four electric meters and the pressure gauge, wiped off the dust, and happily handed them over to the military control commission representative who took over the mine, saying, "These things belong to the country, and they should be returned to the country for use." A few days later, he also found more than one hundred pounds of high-voltage wire from the river ditch cave and handed it over to the public. Following this, mine workers Li Zhong, Dou Rongxian, and Wang Weicheng successively handed over one high-voltage arrester, one box of detonators, and one thousand mortar primers. The above-mentioned model deeds of fighting the enemy, preserving equipment, and handing it over to the People's Government were commended at the mine's workers' congress, and the government awarded Xu Hailin and seven others a total of eighty catties of millet.

　　龙烟铁矿工人许海林等
  　保存器材获奖
    【张垣电】龙烟铁矿工人许海林等献出了已经保存两年的机件，人民政府特予以奖励。两年前我军撤离张垣、宣化后，该矿工人即秘密商量好了，将机器重要零件坚决不交给国民党军。当时许海林等便将四块电表和水塔上的一个压力计拆卸下来，大家公推由许海林负责保存。许海林就把这些东西坚壁在一个闲屋子的水池子里，并在水池子下边用木板很巧妙地伪装起来。一直到这次宣化重获解放，许海林才取出了四块电表和压力计，扫净了上面的尘土，欢喜地送交接管该矿的军管会代表，并说：“这些东西是国家的，还交给国家用。”不几天他又从河沟窑洞里寻找出了一百多斤高压线也交给了公家。接着该矿工人黎忠、窦荣先、王维城等也先后交出了高压避雷器一个、雷管一盒、迫击炮底火一千。对上述与敌斗争保存器材交给人民政府的模范事迹，在该矿职工大会上予以表扬，政府并奖给许海林等八人共小米八十斤。
