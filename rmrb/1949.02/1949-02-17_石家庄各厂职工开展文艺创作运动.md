　　Since the Shijiazhuang Federation of Trade Unions Preparatory Committee called for a literary and artistic creation movement among workers on January 12, it has been enthusiastically responded to by workers in various public enterprises. In half a month, twenty-one works have appeared, including: Automobile Repair Factory: Adapted the script of "The Whole Family is Busy," a set of lantern slides, and a Yangko tune. Second Ordnance Repair Shop: A living newspaper play "The Collapse of the Chiang Kai-shek Bandits," and a New Year's song. Telephone Bureau: A street living newspaper play "Exposing Chiang Kai-shek's Peace Conspiracy," a current affairs duet, a two-act play "Reflection," a three-act play "Trade Union and Cultural Entertainment," and a ditty. Electric Company: A quick-board play introducing electricity, two sets of lantern slides, a one-act play "Four Joys Come to the Door," and a flower drum, a rhyming report, and a crosstalk performance, as well as two songs "Electric Workers' Song" and "Launch a Great Production Competition." Fuyuan Chemical Factory: A ditty "Not Fooled." Among these twenty-one works, seventeen mainly focus on publicizing current affairs and reflecting the production competition of workers, and they are all short, concise, and easy to perform, with great effect. In the process of writing, everyone was very serious and responsible. Comrades Shan Zhen, Guo Chaojie, Wang Shusheng, and others from the Telephone Bureau collectively created three pieces this time. They talked about the creation process and said: "After we read the newspaper, we gathered together to study and collect stories that could illustrate the theme (anti-'peace' conspiracy), then arranged the materials. The method of compiling was to first make it smooth and catchy, and then carefully consider the words and revise the sentences, and that's how it was done." The Electric Company compiled the deeds of the work models in their unit into various forms of performances. Several workers at the Automobile Repair Factory who love cultural entertainment adapted the opera "The Whole Family is Busy," which depicts rural areas supporting the front lines, into workers actively producing to support the front lines, which is particularly vivid and realistic because it depicts the family life of workers. The Shijiazhuang Federation of Trade Unions specially called on all units to continue this movement at the Spring Festival Workers' Movement Preparation Meeting on January 26, especially requesting the literary and artistic workers who are helping in the factories to attach importance to this work, to greatly inspire and assist the workers' creation, and decided to hold an award ceremony for the workers' literary and artistic works after the Lantern Festival, in conjunction with the performance effects.

### 石家庄各厂职工开展文艺创作运动

　　石家庄各厂职工开展文艺创作运动
    石家庄自从一月十二日石市总工会筹委会号召开展职工文艺创作运动以来，已得到各公营企业职工热烈响应。半月中已有二十一个作品出现，计汽车修理厂：改编“全家忙”剧本一个，拉洋片一套，秧歌小调一个。第二修械所：活报剧“蒋匪垮台”一个，新年歌词一个。电话局：街头活报剧“揭穿蒋介石和平阴谋”时事对口唱一个，“反省”两幕话剧一个，“工会与文化娱乐”三幕话剧一个，小调一个。电灯公司：介绍电的快板剧一个，拉洋片两套，“四喜临门”独幕话剧一个，花鼓、数来宝、双簧各一个，还有两个歌子“电灯工人歌”，“展开大生产竞赛”。福源化学厂：“不上当”小调一个。在这二十一个作品中，有十七个是以宣传时事和反映职工生产竞赛情况为主要内容，并且都是短小精悍易于演出，收效挺大的形式。在编写的过程中，大家十分认真负责。电话局单真、郭超杰、王书声等三同志，此次共集体创作了三个东西，他们谈到创作的经过说：“我们看报纸以后，大家就在一起研究，搜集能说明主题（反‘和平’阴谋）的故事，然后安排材料，编的方法是先说顺口流，再斟酌字眼，修改词句，这样就弄成了。”电灯公司则是将本单位工作模范的事迹，编成各种形式表演出来。汽车修理厂几个爱好文化娱乐的职工，把农村支援前线的歌剧“全家忙”，改编为工人的积极生产支援前线，因为是描写工人的家庭生活，所以显得特别生动逼真。石市总工会为此问题，特于一月二十六日春节职工运动筹备会上，向各单位号召继续开展这一运动，尤其要求在各厂帮助工作的文艺工作者，一定要重视这一工作，以大力启发，协助职工的创作，并决定于元宵节后，配合演出来的效果，举行职工文艺作品的给奖。
