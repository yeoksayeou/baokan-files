　　Jiang County Fourth District
  　Exchange Mating Experiences
    [Taiyue Telegram] The Jiang County Fourth District District Office convened a meeting of mating experts on January 10 to exchange mating experiences and encourage them to breed more livestock. Special hospitality was extended to the mating experts at the meeting. It was explained that mating is beneficial to both oneself and others. Some people say that mating work is not honorable, which is due to feudal thinking. It was also explained that if everyone has difficulties, the government can help solve them. After discussion, everyone was determined to manage mating well and serve the masses. Wang Gaichun, Li Shuangshan, and others have already mated more than 100 animals last year and said they will work harder in the future. Finally, everyone exchanged several experiences: (1) When feeding breeding stock, feeding and drinking should be on a fixed schedule with a fixed quantity, and the temperature of the pen should be appropriate. Only when the mother is strong can the offspring be fat; otherwise, if the livestock are thin or sick, the offspring will not be strong. (2) The best time for mating cattle is June, July, and August; the best time for mating donkeys is February, March, and April, because cattle are pregnant for ten months, and donkeys are pregnant for one year. Mating at this time means they will be born in the spring, when the climate is mild and the grass is lush, making it easy to feed both large and small livestock. Two matings are required at the time of mating, as one may not be enough to ensure pregnancy. Everyone also agreed on prices: mating cattle costs two big dou of feed, half of which is given at the time of mating, and the remainder is given after the calf is born. Mating donkeys costs four big dou, half of the feed given first, and the other half given later.

　　绛县四区
  　交流配种经验
    【太岳电】绛县四区区公所一月十日召开配种行家座谈会，交流配种经验，鼓励他们大量繁殖牲畜。会上对各配种行家特别予以招待。说明配种是利己利人的事情。有人说配种工作不光彩，是封建思想作怪。并说明大家有了困难，政府可以帮助解决。经过讨论，大家决心好好经营配种，为群众服务。王改春、李双善等，去年已配种一百多头，表示以后还要大干。最后大家互相交换了几点经验：（一）喂养种畜，喂、饮要有定时、定量，圈的温度要适当。母壮才能儿肥，要不然，牲口瘦弱了，或生了病，配下小畜不壮。（二）配种时间，牛以六、七、八月最好；驴以二、三、四月最好，因为牛怀胎十个月，驴怀胎一年，这时配种，生时正是春天，气候温和，草又肥嫩，大小牲口都好喂养。在交配时，需两次，一次怕不保险。大家又议决了价格：配牛是二大斗料，配时先给一半，其余生下犊再给。配驴四大斗，也是先给一半料，以后再给一半。
