Taiyue Electric Dispatch: Since the counties in the Taiyue Area formulated their major production plans for this year in early November last year, they have universally launched movements to accumulate fertilizer, repair and manufacture farm tools, add livestock, and prepare fuel for spring. By the end of January this year, achievements had been made. In terms of fertilizer accumulation, according to statistics from 305 villages in ten counties including Qin County, Tunliu, Fushan, Qinshui, Yicheng, and Yangcheng, approximately half of the fertilizer has been prepared. For example, in the first district of Tunliu, 44 administrative villages have prepared an average of 23 loads of manure per mu. In Donglizhai, Jincheng, the Liu Baocheng mutual aid group has completely prepared the fertilizer for 2,188 mu of autumn land. In terms of accumulated firewood and charcoal, most areas have enough to cover spring plowing. Yangcheng has prepared fuel for three to five months. Some households without labor are also trying to prepare. For example, Yang Tianyou, Yang Chengde, and Yang Li of Fushan have exchanged enough coal for three months of burning through weaving and labor exchange. In terms of adding livestock, according to existing materials, the entire area has purchased more than 3,000 heads of livestock from livestock-producing areas. The First Special District Trading Company and the bank alone bought back 526 heads, and 170 villages in Jincheng bought back 1,479 heads. In terms of farm tools, most counties have established iron and wood factories. Yicheng, Jiang County, and Jincheng have all held iron and wood factory meetings to solve the difficulties of lacking capital and help workers open factories and set up furnaces. Many farm tools have been produced. However, there are still the following problems in the leadership of production in various places: (1) Insufficient attention is paid to production, and production is not placed in the first place of government work. For example, Qin County excessively emphasizes difficulties, believing that accumulating fertilizer, firewood and charcoal, weaving, transporting, and repairing farm tools are all impossible at present. Some cadres even think that "production does not need leadership." At the same time, there are very few cadres in various places who specialize in leading production, and they cannot take care of it. For example, in individual districts of Yangcheng and Anze, cadres are busy with daily affairs, and no one even listens to the reports from the key villages. In Anze, in January, only two of the seven districts held production meetings, while the other districts did not. Many areas cannot organize a certain force to carry out promotion and inspection work. In Yangcheng, only the Yue Village key point in the first district is regularly maintained among the seven key villages in the county, and most of the rest are left to develop spontaneously. (2) The generalization of leadership and planning, lacking clear work priorities that are in line with local conditions. Judging from the reports received by the Administrative Office, it is rare to see which item is the main focus of work in various places, what problems have been discovered, how to solve them, and what experiences have been gained. Now that the old lunar year has passed, and spring plowing is just around the corner, how to overcome the spontaneous development phenomenon in winter production and strengthen the leadership of spring plowing preparation work is our most important task at present.

### 太岳各地积极准备春耕　部分地区放松领导

　　太岳各地积极准备春耕
  　部分地区放松领导
    【太岳电】太岳区各县自去年十一月初作出了今年大生产计划以后，就普遍展开了积肥、修制农具、添买牲口、准备春时燃料的运动，到今年一月底已作出了成绩。在积肥上，据沁县、屯留、浮山、沁水、翼城、阳城等十个县三百零五个村统计：大约已准备好一半肥料。如屯留一区四十四个行政村，每亩已平均准备下二十三担粪。晋城东李寨刘保成互助组，二千一百八十八亩秋地的肥料，已完全准备好了。在积好的柴炭方面，大部地区已能接上春耕。阳城已准备下三个月至五个月的燃料。有些没劳力的户，也正设法准备。如浮山的杨天佑、杨成德、杨李氏等用纺织和变工换够了三个月的烧煤。在增添牲口上，据现有的材料，全区已从产牲口区购回牲口三千余头。单是一专区贸易公司和银行就买回五百二十六头，晋城一百七十个村，就买回了一千四百七十九头。在农具方面，大部县已建立起铁木工厂。翼城、绛县、晋城都召开铁木工厂会议，解决了缺乏资本的困难，帮助工人开厂设炉。并已制出了不少农具。但在各地对生产的领导上，还存在着以下问题：（一）对生产重视不够，未将生产放到政府工作的第一位。如沁县过分强调困难，以为目前积肥、积柴炭、纺织、运输、修农具都没法做，甚至有的干部还认为“生产无需领导”。同时各地专门领导生产的干部很少，照顾不来。如阳城、安泽个别区，干部忙于日常事务，连基点村汇报也没人听取。安泽在一月份，七个区只有两个区召开了生产会议，其他区就没开。很多地区不能组织一定力量去进行推动检查工作。阳城全县七个基点村，实际只有一区岳庄基点经常坚持，其余大部自流。（二）领导与计划上的一般化，缺乏切合当地情况的明确的工作重点。从行署收到的报告来看，很少看出各地工作究以那项为主要，发现那些问题，怎样解决，有什么经验。目前旧历年已过，转眼春耕就要到了，如何克服冬季生产中的自流现象，加强春耕准备工作的领导，就是我们当前最主要的任务。
