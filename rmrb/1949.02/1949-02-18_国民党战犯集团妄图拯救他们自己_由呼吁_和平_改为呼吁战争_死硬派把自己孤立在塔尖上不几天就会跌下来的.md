Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 16th -- Since Chiang Kai-shek's bandit gang launched a peace offensive on January 1, the Kuomintang reactionaries' heroes, who had repeatedly stated that they were willing to "shorten the war time," "reduce the people's suffering," and "take saving the people as the premise," suddenly lowered their peace tone in early February, and the old tune of "negotiating with the Communist Party to the end" was played again. This has been even more so in recent days. After the Nanjing People's Delegation visited Beiping and returned, they were immediately persecuted by these heroes. On the 13th, the Kuomintang Central Propaganda Department issued a "special propaganda instruction" to "all party departments and newspapers," saying: "Ye Jianying used the so-called Nanjing Peace Delegation as a mouthpiece to promote in our rear that the CCP is sincere about peace, while accusing the government's military deployment of being insincere in seeking peace. All newspapers must refute this from the front and side based on the following points." This "special propaganda instruction" listed several points in a row. "The government would rather fight to the end than surrender unconditionally." "The eight points raised in Mao Zedong's statement on January 14 are conditions for national subjugation, and the government should not have accepted them in the first place." "The CCP should be held responsible for undermining peace. Today, the CCP has instead put forward a so-called list of war criminals, including all government officials responsible; it even demands that the government arrest them first, which is clearly barbaric and unreasonable. If the CCP does not change this approach, it will be difficult to find a way for peaceful negotiations." The look of grief and anxiety to negotiate that they had two weeks ago is gone. The famous sentences that spread throughout the world and touched people's hearts, such as "shortening the war time," "reducing the people's suffering," and "taking saving the people as the premise," are no longer mentioned. If the CCP is unwilling to change its "style" and insists on punishing war criminals, then peace cannot be discussed. Is it taking saving the people as the premise? Or is it taking saving war criminals as the premise? According to the "special propaganda instruction" of the Kuomintang heroes, the latter was chosen. The list of war criminals is still being solicited by the CCP from various democratic parties and people's organizations. It is said that opinions from several parties have been received. According to these opinions already received, none of them agree with the list of 43 war criminals proposed by a certain authoritative person on December 25 last year. They believe that every one of the 43 war criminals listed is correct, but it is a pity that there are too few. They believe that the people who should be held responsible for launching the counter-revolutionary war and slaughtering millions of people are definitely not just 43, but should be one hundred and several tens. Now, let's assume that the war criminals will be determined to be one hundred and several tens. Then we must ask our heroes: Why do you oppose punishing war criminals? Aren't you willing to "shorten the war time" and "reduce the people's suffering"? If this opposition of yours makes the war continue, wouldn't it delay the time and prolong the war? The crime of "delaying the time and prolonging the war" was declared by you in the name of the Nanjing government spokesman on January 26, 1949, and placed on the Communist Party. Now, do you want to take it back, write it on posters, and hang it on yourselves as glory? You are people of great compassion "taking saving the people as the premise." Why have you suddenly changed to taking saving war criminals as the premise? According to the statistics of your government's Ministry of Interior, the number of Chinese people is not 450 million, but 475 million. How do these compare to one hundred and several tens of war criminals? Heroes have learned arithmetic, please calculate it carefully according to the arithmetic textbook before drawing a conclusion. If you do not calculate it clearly and hastily change your original very good proposal, which we also agree with, and the people of the whole country also agree with—"taking saving the people as the premise"—to "taking saving one hundred and several tens of war criminals as the premise," then you must be careful, you will definitely not be able to stand firm. The people who shout "taking saving the people as the premise" are going to persecute the Nanjing People's Peace Delegation again, saying that they have become Ye Jianying's mouthpiece. Ye Jianying's magic power is so great that in a few days he made the representatives believe that "the CCP is sincere about peace, while accusing the government's military deployment of being insincere in seeking peace." On February 14, the diehards used the Nanjing Municipal Council to pass "a rejection of the Nanjing People's Peace Delegation case." A part of the diehards in the Kuomintang "CC" and Revival factions, that is, the war criminal group, after "calling for peace" for a few weeks, are no longer "calling for peace" but calling for war. Even the representatives of the Nanjing People's Peace Delegation are going to be persecuted. The Kuomintang diehards are so unlucky. No matter who it is, even the people within their party who have a little conscience, as long as they are unwilling to go along with them, they will be persecuted and attacked, thus isolating themselves on the top of the pagoda, and they will not repent until death. The broad masses of people in the Yangtze River Basin and the South, including workers, peasants, intellectuals, the free bourgeoisie, enlightened gentry, and conscientious Kuomintang members, are listening: The Kuomintang diehards who are rampaging over your heads have no time to live for a few days. We and you are on the same side. A small group of diehards will fall from the top of the pagoda in a few days, and a people's China is about to appear.

　　国民党战犯集团妄图拯救他们自己
    由呼吁“和平”改为呼吁战争
    死硬派把自己孤立在塔尖上不几天就会跌下来的
    【新华社陕北十六日电】自从一月一日蒋匪介石发动和平攻势以后，曾经连篇累牍地表示自己是愿意“缩短战争时间”，“减轻人民痛苦”，“以拯救人民为前提”的国民党反动派的英雄好汉们，一到二月上旬，和平的调子突然低落下去，“和共党周旋到底”的老调，忽又高弹起来。最近数日，更是如此。南京人民代表团访问北平回去之后，立即遭到这些英雄好汉们的迫害。十三日，国民党中央宣传部发给“各党部各党报”的“特别宣传指示”说：“叶剑英利用所谓南京和平代表团作传声筒，向我后方宣传中共对和平有诚意，而指责政府军事布置为无诚意谋和。各报对此，必须依据下列各点从正面与侧面力加驳斥。”这个“特别宣传指示”一连列举了好几点。“政府与其无条件投降，不如作战到底”。“毛泽东一月十四日声明所提八点为亡国条件，政府原不应接受”。“中共应负破坏和平之责任，今日中共反而提出所谓战犯名单，将政府负责人士尽皆列入；更要求政府先行逮捕，其蛮横无理，显而易见。中共如不改变此种作风，则和平商谈之途径，势难寻觅。”两星期以前那种如丧考妣地急着要谈判的神情，再也不见了。所谓“缩短战争时间”，“减轻人民痛苦”，“以拯救人民为前提”这些传遍人间，沁人心脾的名句，再也不提了。假如中共不愿意改变自己的“作风”，一定要惩办战争罪犯，那就不能谈和平了。究竟是以拯救人民为前提呢？还是拯救战争罪犯为前提呢？按照国民党英雄好汉的“特别宣传指示”，是选择了后者。战争罪犯的名单，中共方面尚在向各民主党派人民团体征求意见中，听说已经收到了好几方面的意见。根据这些已经收到的意见，都是不赞成去年十二月二十五日某权威人士所提的那个名单。他们认为那个名单所列四十三个战犯个个都对，但是可惜太少。他们认为要负发动反革命战争屠杀数百万人民的责任的人决不止四十三个，而应当是一百几十个。现在姑且假定战犯将确定为一百几十个，那么要问我们的英雄好汉们：你们为什么要反对惩办战犯呢？你们不是愿意“缩短战争时间”，“减轻人民痛苦”吗？假如因为你们这一反对，使得战争还要打下去，岂非拖延时间，延长战祸？“拖延时间，延长战祸”这八个字的罪名是你们在一九四九年一月二十六日以南京政府发言人的名义，发出声明，加在共产党身上的，现在难道你们想收回去，写上招贴，挂在你们自己身上，以为荣耀吗？你们是“以拯救人民为前提”的大慈大悲的人们，为什么一下子又改成以拯救战犯为前提呢？根据你们政府内政部的统计，中国人民的数目，不是四万万五千万，而是四万万七千五百万，这和一百几十个战犯相比究竟大小如何呢？英雄们是学过算术的，请你们按照算术教科书好好算一下再作结论罢。倘若你们不去算清楚就将你们那个原来很好，我们也同意，全国人民也同意的提法——“以拯救人民为前提”，急急忙忙地改成“以拯救一百几十个战犯为前提”，那你们可要仔细，你们一定站不住脚。口口声声“以拯救人民为前提”的人们，又要迫害南京人民和平代表团，说他们变成了叶剑英的传声筒。叶剑英的魔力这么大，几天工夫就使代表们相信“中共对和平有诚意，而指责政府军事布置为无诚意谋和”。二月十四日，死硬派利用南京市参议会通过“否认京市人民和平代表团一案”。国民党“ＣＣ”复兴两系中的一部分死硬派，亦即战犯集团，任自己“呼吁和平”几个星期之后，不是“呼吁和平”，而是呼吁战争了，就连南京人民和平代表团的代表们也要被迫害了。国民党死硬派就是这样倒霉的，不管什么人，就是他们党内稍有良心的人们也罢，只要谁不愿意跟他们一路走，就得遭迫害，捱打击，因而把他们自己孤立在宝塔的尖顶上，而且至死也不悔悟。长江流域和南方的人民大众，包括工人，农民，知识分子，自由资产阶级，开明绅士，有良心的国民党人都听着：站在你们头上横行霸道的国民党死硬派，没有几天活命的时间了，我们和你们是站在一个方面的，一小撮死硬派不要几天就会从宝塔尖上跌下去，一个人民的中国就要出现了。
