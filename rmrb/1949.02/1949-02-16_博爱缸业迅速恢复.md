　　Bo'ai Pottery Industry Rapidly Recovers
    [Taihang Electric] The renowned Baishan pottery industry in Bo'ai has been rapidly recovering and developing in the past two months. According to statistics, the number of pottery wheels in the village has increased from 13 before November of last year to 51. A total of 290 households and 1,165 people in the village are engaged in pottery production. Due to the increase in production and the expansion of sales, the masses have gained considerable profits. According to statistics from 25 wheels, more than 13,000 sets of large and small pottery jars have been produced in the past two months, with a profit of more than 12.91 million yuan (Jizhao). Among them, 75 workers can earn a salary of more than 210,000 yuan each. Most of the 80 livestock participate in grinding clay for pottery, and each head can earn one big dou of corn per day. Ninety-three small carts transport goods from the kiln to Wen, Meng and other counties and sell them back for money, making a round trip every seven days, earning about 8 million yuan. Production has solved the livelihood difficulties of many people. For example, Liu Guizhou, who burns pottery, is over 60 years old with a family of seven. In the past, he lacked both grain and cooking oil and salt, but now he has grain, oil and salt to eat. Liu Bozhuang, who pushes a small cart, had nothing to wear in the past, but now he has changed into new cotton clothes and new quilts, and his family also has more than three dan of corn. Due to the improvement of living standards, everyone has a high enthusiasm for production. Ninety-three households in the first and second streets plan to burn nineteen kilns of pottery before the Lunar New Year. The masses who push small carts to sell goods say: "As long as the kiln produces goods, we will push them out to sell even if it's not the New Year." The main reasons for the rapid development of the village's pottery industry are: First, publicizing the policy of protecting and developing industry and commerce, and dispelling the masses' ideological concerns about daring to boldly develop production. And using accounting methods to inspire everyone's enthusiasm for production. Second, the government provides a large number of loans to solve the funding difficulties of the pottery industry. Last winter, 7 million yuan was loaned, and now another 15,000 jin of corn have been loaned. Third, wide sales and large profits, labor-capital cooperation in production, mobilizing and organizing kiln owners, workers, livestock, and pushcart drivers, and overcoming difficulties in production. Fourth, the establishment of a pottery industry management committee, composed of three members, is responsible for finding sales outlets externally and promoting finished products; internally, it leads production and solves various difficulties and problems in production.

　　博爱缸业迅速恢复
    【太行电】著名的博爱柏山制缸业，近两月来正在迅速的恢复与发展中。据统计该村旋缸轮盘已由去年十一月以前的十三盘发展到五十一盘，全村参加缸业生产的共有二百九十余户，一千一百六十五人。由于生产增加和销路扩大，群众获得很大利润。据二十五盘轮统计：两月来共产大小缸一万三千余套，可得利一千二百九十一万余元（冀钞下同），其中七十五个工人，每人可赚工资廿一万余元。八十头牲口，大部参加碾缸土，每头每天能赚一大斗玉茭，九十三辆小车不下本在窑上推上货，到温、孟等县卖了回来给钱，七天一回，约赚八百余万元。经过生产已解决了不少群众的生活困难。如烧缸的刘贵州，六十多岁，家有七口人，以前既缺少粮食又吃不上油盐，现在已有了粮食油盐吃。推小车的刘伯壮，过去没吃穿，现在换成新棉衣，新被子，家还有三石多玉茭。由于生活的提高与改善，大家的生产情绪很高。一、二两街有九十三户还计划在旧历年前烧出十九窑缸。推小车卖货的群众说：“只要窑上烧出货，我们不过年也要推出去卖。”该村缸窑业发展迅速的主要原因是：一、宣传保护发展工商业政策，解除群众不敢大胆发展生产的思想顾虑。并用算帐办法，启发了大家生产积极性。二、政府发放大量贷款，解决缸业资金困难。去年冬季曾贷款七百万元，现又贷出一万五千斤玉茭。三、销路广利润大，劳资合作生产，把窑主、工人、牲口、推小车等都动员组织起来，克服了生产中的困难。四、组织了缸业管理委员会，由三个委员负责，对外找销路，推销成品；对内领导生产，解决生产中的各种困难和问题。
