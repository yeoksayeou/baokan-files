　　Workers at Jiaozuo Electromechanical Plant Improve Technology and Increase Production
    Since liberation, the employees of the Jiaozuo Xinhua Company's Electromechanical Plant, under the leadership of the trade union, have undergone two months of education, and the ideological awareness of the workers has significantly improved. The boiler room workers were divided into three shifts, day and night, with fourteen people per shift. During the Kuomintang period, they burned twenty-three carts of coal (fully loaded) every day, and the steam was often less than eighty pumps. In the two months since liberation, the workers realized that they were the masters of the enterprise and actively researched production. Now, three workers are automatically reduced per shift, and four carts of coal are saved per shift. The entire boiler room has reduced nine workers and saved twelve carts of coal, while still maintaining around ninety pumps of steam. During the Kuomintang period, the foundry workers opened the furnace twice a month, producing eight hundred pounds of molten steel each time. Now, they open the furnace six times a month, producing two thousand catties of molten steel each time. The electromechanical workers originally planned to repair fifty mine cars in twenty days, but they completed the task in fifteen days. In the past, fitters and machinists used to take three days to repair a high car, but now they can repair it in two days. Now, most of the workers in each department have become active, and when you approach the factory, you can hear the workers singing cheerful songs.

　　焦作机电厂工人改进技术生产提高
    焦作新华公司机电厂职工，自解放后，在职工会领导下，进行了两个月教育，工友们在思想觉悟上有了显著的提高。锅炉房工人，白天黑夜共分三班，每班十四人，国民党在时每天烧炭二十三车（装的很满），汽经常不足八十泵、解放后两月时间，工友们认识了自己是企业的主人翁，在生产上积极研究，现在每班自动减去三个工人，每班节省煤炭四车。全锅炉房减少九个工人，节省煤炭十二车，经常还能保持到九十泵左右的汽。国民党在时，翻沙班工人每月开二次炉，每次出钢铁水八百磅，现在每月开炉六次，每次出钢铁水两千斤。机电工人原计划二十天修理五十个方车，结果十五天就完成任务。过去钳工和元车上修理一部高车，用三天，现在二天就修好了，现在各部工人大部分都积极起来了，当你走近工厂时，就可听见工人们在唱着愉快的歌声。
