　　Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 15th. The actions of US imperialism in supporting the Nehru reactionary clique to act as the protagonist in obstructing the rising Southeast Asian people's movement have become increasingly clear. According to a Diantong News Agency dispatch from New Delhi on the 11th: The US State Department has proposed a wide-ranging so-called "security alliance." This alliance is supported by the United States, with India playing the main political and economic role. Senior Indian figures stated that US spokespersons pointed out that after the US imperialist's aggressive position in China was destroyed by the Chinese people, "the stability of the Far East lost its most solid pillar." The US State Department insists that the restoration of stability in the Far East should be the primary responsibility of the Indian rulers. To this end, officials from the US Embassy in India are discussing the so-called "US-India Friendship, Commerce, and Navigation Treaty" with Nehru. The dispatch continued: The current purpose of the discussions between the Nehru government and US officials is closely related to the recent Asian conference held in Delhi. This conference was nominally to discuss measures to deal with the Dutch aggression against Indonesia, but in various closed and tense meetings, discussions were held on jointly adopting new measures to suppress the people's liberation movements in Southeast Asia.

　　美帝加紧扶植尼赫鲁
  　充当远东侵略走卒
    【新华社陕北十五日电】美帝国主义扶植尼赫鲁反动集团充当阻挠高涨中的东南亚人民运动主角的行动，已日益明朗化。据电通社新德里十一日讯：美国务院已提出范围广泛的所谓“安全联盟”。该联盟由美国支持，其政治与经济上的主要角色则由印度担任。印度高级人士谈：美方发言人曾指出，美帝国主义在中国的侵略阵地被中国人民冲垮之后，“远东的安定就失却最稳固的支柱”。美国务院力主远东安定的恢复，应由印度统治者负主要责任。为此，美驻印大使馆官员正与尼赫鲁商谈所谓“美印友好、商务与航海条约”。该电继称：尼赫鲁政府与美国官员之间的商谈，其当前目的系与最近在德里举行的亚洲会议密切相关。该会议名义上是讨论对付荷兰侵略印尼的措施，但在各次不公开的紧张会议中，曾经商讨关于协力采取新措施以镇压东南亚的人民解放运动。
