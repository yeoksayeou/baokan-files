　　【Taiyue Dispatch】In order to strengthen the construction of the people's local armed forces, the Taiyue First Military Sub-district officially began training people's armed cadres from various counties on January 15th. Participating in the training were cadres from 233 villages who had undergone Party rectification and completed land reform. The main purpose of this training is to overcome the lax and paralyzing thoughts of some cadres, strengthen political education, improve discipline, and prepare to launch universal people's armed training and rectify and consolidate people's armed organizations. Since the recovery of Pingyao, Jiexiu, and Lingqiu in northern Yue, there have been no overt enemies in the surrounding areas. As a result, militiamen and cadres have developed serious paralysis and a lack of vigilance against the enemy's covert sabotage, causing the people's armed work to drift. In some villages, the number of militiamen has decreased invisibly, and the militia organizations also exist in a somewhat disorganized state. For example, Cui Qihui, director of the Armed Committee of Hanhong Village in Qinyuan, even forgot the names of the militia squad leaders in the village. In Beisishang, Qin County, there were originally twenty militiamen, but due to organizational laxity, only three militiamen are currently working. Some guns in Duncun, Tunliu, are also rusted. The above phenomena have greatly affected the work of supporting the front and maintaining social order in the rear. Therefore, it is very important to rectify the people's armed forces. At the opening ceremony, Director Liang of the Armed Committee branch pointed out: Under the situation of national victory, we must step up our studies, rectify our people's armed forces, maintain social order in the rear, support the front, and strive for national victory. He called on everyone not to be complacent and self-satisfied, but to learn with humility. Li Huarui and more than a dozen other comrades from the Third District of Qinyuan took the lead in responding to the call, determined to learn well. Comrade Zhang Quangui from Changzi County said: "I used to be a shepherd boy, but now I have turned over. The masses elected me as the director. If I don't study hard, I can't do things well for the masses." Everyone unanimously expressed their determination to improve themselves and strive to do a good job in the people's armed forces.

　　太岳一分区集训人民武装干部
    【太岳电】太岳一分区为了加强人民地方武装建设，一月十五日正式开始集训各县人民武装干部。参加集训的有经过整党结束土改的二百卅三个村的干部。这次训练，主要的是克服某些干部的松懈麻痹思想，加强政治教育，提高纪律性，准备展开普遍的人民武装训练，整顿巩固人民武装组织。因为岳北自平、介、灵收复以来，周围已无公开的敌人，因此民兵和干部产生了严重的麻痹思想，对敌人的暗中破坏，警觉性很差，使人民武装工作自流起来。有些村子民兵人数无形减少，民兵组织也存在着某些焕散状态。如沁源韩洪村武委会主任崔启辉连村里民兵班长的名字也忘了。沁县北寺上原有二十个民兵，因组织松懈，现只有三个民兵在工作。屯留邓村有些枪也锈了。上述这种现象大大影响支援前线工作与后方的社会治安，因此，整顿人民武装十分重要。在开学典礼的大会上，武委分会梁主任指出：在全国胜利的形势下，要加紧学习，把我们的人民武装整顿好，维持后方治安，支援前线，争取全国胜利。号召大家不要自满自足，要虚心学习。沁源三区李虎瑞等十余位同志，首先积极响应号召，决心学习好。长子县张全贵同志说：“咱过去是个放羊孩，现在翻身了，群众选咱当了主任，要不好好学习，就不能给群众把事情办好。”大家一致表示要决心提高自己，努力把人民武装搞好。
