　　Preparations for the Election of People's Courts in the Soviet Union
    by Bakhmov

    In the coming months, elections for the People's Courts will be held throughout the Soviet Union. The "Regulations for the Election of People's Courts of the Russian Soviet Federative Socialist Republic" have already been published in Soviet publications. Subsequently, similar regulations will be published in other member Soviet republics.

    The new election law for the People's Courts, like the election law for the Soviets of Workers' Deputies, is based on the solid principles of the Stalin Constitution, and every article embodies the spirit of Soviet democracy.

    Article 1 of the regulations states:

    "People's Courts are elected by citizens within the district on the basis of universal, direct, and equal suffrage by secret ballot for a term of three years."

    The election regulations eliminate any restrictions on suffrage. All Soviet citizens who have reached the age of eighteen, regardless of race, nationality, gender, religion, social origin, property status, or past actions, have the right to elect the People's Courts, and citizens who have reached the age of twenty-three and have not been tried by a court also have the right to be elected as People's Judges and Assessors under the same conditions.

    Those who do not have the right to elect or be elected to the People's Courts are those who have been deprived of their electoral rights by the court. Such people are those suffering from mental illness (insane persons).

    The upcoming elections of the People's Courts will help the forward development and consolidation of socialist justice and people's democracy.

    Such elections do not exist and cannot exist in bourgeois countries. In most countries, judges are not elected but appointed from among those who show loyalty to the ruling class. The fundamental difference between the Soviet court and the bourgeois court is that the Soviet court adjudicates fairly and without any favoritism or privilege. Before the Soviet court and under Soviet law, all citizens are equal, regardless of skin color, language, property status, or religion. For example, the courts in the United States do not allow black people to have equal rights.

    The Soviet court represents the name of the state, and the state represents the interests of all workers. In the Soviet Union, the interests of society and the state are protected by all workers. The Soviet court upholds the interests of the social system, which is based on the socialist ownership of the means of production, where there is no exploitation of man by man. In contrast, the bourgeois court protects the interests of the capitalist system, in which society is divided into exploiters and the exploited, and the court is a tool for suppressing the resistance of the exploited.

    The regulations for the election of People's Courts also emphasize one of the most important characteristics of the Soviet court: in each electoral district, along with the election of judges, People's Assessors, with a number ranging from fifty to seventy-five, are also elected by secret ballot. In the Soviet court, the People's Assessors play a huge role. In trials and judgments, the opinions of the People's Assessors are equal to the opinions of the judge. If the opinions of two People's Assessors differ from the opinion of the judge, then the judgment or decision is based on the opinions of the Assessors.

    Tens of thousands of male and female workers, male and female collective farmers, and intellectuals will fulfill the glorious responsibility of being elected as People's Assessors in the Soviet state. They will participate in consolidating the socialist just order on the basis of protecting the great democratic rights of Soviet citizens and the Soviet state.

    In the Soviet Union, along with the preparations for the election of the People's Courts, the People's Judges and People's Assessors are also giving work reports to their voters in large numbers. The work reports of Soviet judges to their voters demonstrate the democratic nature of Soviet just adjudication. If a judge or People's Assessor does not fulfill their duties, the voters have the right to remove them at any time and elect the most suitable person, who is trusted by the people, to replace them. The regulations for the election of People's Courts stipulate that when a People's Judge is removed, a new election should be held no later than two months after the judge's dismissal.

    Every article of the election regulations expresses the genuine concern of the Soviet state to establish all conditions to ensure that Soviet voters truly freely express their will in the election of People's Judges, and also to ensure the active participation of all residents in the election, as well as broad popular supervision of the correctness of the election.

    Social organizations and labor collectives—Communist Party organizations, trade unions, cooperative organizations, youth organizations and cultural groups, as well as general meetings of workers and staff in enterprises, soldiers, collective farms, and rural peasants, and general meetings of workers and staff in state-owned farms—have the right to nominate candidates for People's Judges.

    This procedure for nominating candidates ensures that the people have the possibility to elect those who are infinitely loyal to their country and to the people as People's Judges and Assessors.

    Popular supervision of the correct conduct of elections is carried out through the procedures of the statistical committees composed of broad social representatives in the electoral districts and electoral sub-districts: these committees consist of five to seven people in the electoral districts and five to eleven people in the sub-districts. At the same time, the election regulations give representatives of social organizations, representatives of labor collectives, and representatives of publications the right to participate in the counting of ballots. The register of voters in each electoral district, as well as the register of candidates registered with the corresponding Soviet of Workers' Deputies, shall be published twenty days before the election. It is stipulated that elections be conducted on non-working days and that voters be notified of the election date one and a half months in advance.

    The person who receives the most votes, that is, more than half of the votes cast in the entire electoral district and considered valid, is recognized as being elected as a judge or assessor.

    If no candidate for People's Judge receives an absolute majority in the electoral district, a new election shall be announced from among the two candidates who have received the most votes. The date of the re-election shall be set no later than two weeks after the first election.

    The right to elect People's Courts, like all other democratic rights of Soviet citizens, is granted by the Stalin Constitution and is guaranteed by law. The election regulations state: anyone who uses coercion, deception, threats, or other means to obstruct Soviet citizens from exercising their right to elect or be elected as People's Judges or Assessors shall be punished by deprivation of freedom for two years. Those who forge election documents or deliberately incorrectly count votes shall be subject to more severe punishment.

　　苏联人民法庭选举的准备工作
    巴合莫夫作
    在最近几个月内，将于全苏联举行人民法庭的选举。在苏维埃的刊物上，早已公布了“俄罗斯苏维埃联邦社会主义共和国之人民法庭选举条例”。随之，在其它盟员苏维埃共和国内，也要公布这样的条例。
    人民法庭之新选举法，也象劳动者代表苏维埃之选举法一样，其基础是建于斯大林宪法之坚牢的原则上，并且其每一条都贯彻着苏维埃民主主义的精神。
    在条例的第一条内说道：
    “人民法庭是由区内的公民在普遍，直接和平等选举权的基础上，以秘密投票选举之，其限期为三年”。
    选举条例消除任何选举权的限制。满十八岁的全体苏维埃公民，不在于种族和民族，性别，信仰，社会出身，财产状况，以及过去的行动，都有权选举人民法庭，而满了二十三岁的，没受过法庭审判的公民，也在这样的条件下，都有人民审判官的和助审的被选权。
    没有人民法庭之选举权和被选权的人，是由法庭褫夺了选举权的。向这样的人，是患有精神病的（疯狂人）。
    人民法庭之将来的选举，将协助社会主义之公正和人民民主主义之向前发展和巩固。
    在资产阶级的国家，象这样的选举是没有的，并且也不能有，在大多数的国家，审判官不是选举，而是由表示忠实于统治阶级的人们中委任。苏维埃的法庭，与资产阶级的法庭之基本区别，是在于苏维埃的法庭公平裁判，对谁都没有另外和特权。在苏维埃法庭前和苏维埃法律下，全体公民，不在于肤色，语言，财产状况或信仰，都是平等的。比方，美国的法庭却在不许可黑人有平等权利。
    苏维埃法庭是代表国家的名义，而国家代表全体劳动者的利益，在苏联，社会与国家之利益，则由全体劳动者来保护。苏维埃法庭固守社会制度的利益，此制度是以没有人对人之剥削的生产工具与生产资料之社会主义财产为其基础。资产阶级的法庭与此相反，它保护资本主义制度的利益，在资本主义制度下，社会则分为剥削者与被剥削者，而法庭则为镇压被剥削者之反抗的工具。
    人民法庭选举条例还着重指出苏维埃法庭一个最重要的特点：在每一选举区内，与选举审判官同时，以秘密投票还要选举人民的助审，其人数由五十至七十五为止。在苏维埃法庭，人民的助审起着巨大的作用，在审案时和判决时，人民助审的主见与审判官的主见是平等的，如果两个人民助审的意见与审判官的意见不同，那么即根据助审的意见来判决或决定。
    成万的男女工人，男女集体农民及知识分子，在苏维埃国家，将尽其被选为人民助审的光荣责任。在保护苏维埃公民之伟大民主权利和苏维埃国家的基础上，来参加巩固社会主义的公正秩序。
    在苏联，随之人民法庭选举的准备工作，还大批的举行人民审判官及人民助审对其选民的工作报告。苏维埃审判官对其选民之工作报告是表示苏维埃公正裁判的民主性。如果，审判官或者是人民助审不应其职责时，选民有权在任何时把他们撤消，而选举最适当的，在人民中有信仰的人来代替。人民法庭选举条例指出，在撤消人民审判官时，新的选举是应在审判官免职后两个月以前举行之。
    选举条例的每一条都表示苏维埃国家真正的关心建立一切条件，以便保证苏维埃选民在人民审判官之选举中，真正自由的表示意志，并且也保证全体居民积极的参加选举，以及广泛人民监督正确的选举。
    社会的组织和劳动者的团体——共产党的组织、职工会、合作社的组织、青年的组织和文化团体、以及企业中的工人、职员全体大会、军人、集体农庄、与乡村的农民，及国营农场之工人、职员等全体大会，都有人民审判官之候选人的推举权。
    这种候选人的推举程序，是保证人民有可能把那些对自己国家及对人民的无限忠诚的人，选为人民审判官和助审。
    人民监督正确的进行选举，是经过在选举区和选举分区内，由广泛的社会代表组成的统计委员会的手续实施之：此委员会，在选举区内，由五人至七人组成，而在分区内，由五人至十一人组成。同时，选举条例给社会组织的代表，劳动者之团体的代表和刊物的代表们以权利，来参加选举票的统计。在每一选举区之选民的名册，以及在相当的劳动者代表苏维埃登记过的候选人的名册，要在选举前二十日公布之。规定在非工作日进行选举，并把选举日期，在一个半月以前通知给选民。
    得到票数最多的，即是超过全选举区所投的、并认为有效的票数一半以上的人才承认是被选为审判官或助审。
    如果，在选举区内，没有一个人民审判官的候选人得到绝对大多数时，则宣布由两个已得了最多票数的候选人当中，进行重新选举，重选日期要规定于第一次选举之后的两个星期以前。
    人民法庭之选举权，也和苏联公民其它一切民主权利一样，是斯大林宪法所给与的，并有法律作担保。在选举条例上说道：有谁用强迫、欺骗、威胁或者其它行动的办法，来妨碍苏维埃公民去实现人民审判官或助审之选举权或当选——以褫夺二年自由惩罚之。伪造选举文件者或者故意不正确统计票数的负责人要受到更重的惩罚。
