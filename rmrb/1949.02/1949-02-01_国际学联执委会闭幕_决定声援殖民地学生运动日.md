　　IUS Executive Committee Concludes
  　Decides on Day of Solidarity with Colonial Student Movements
    Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 29th. TASS, Prague, 26th: The meeting of the Executive Committee of the International Union of Students (IUS) has concluded. The Executive Committee discussed and adopted the report of the IUS Secretariat, and passed several resolutions regarding further activities of the IUS. At the closing meeting, the Executive Committee also passed telegrams of greetings to the democratic youth of China, Greece, and Latin American countries; and decided that all national youth organizations affiliated with the IUS should hold a Day of Solidarity with the democratic student movements in all colonial and dependent countries on February 21, 1949. The Executive Committee pointed out in its decision that the situation of students and youth in Greece, Spain, and various colonial and dependent countries is deteriorating. At the same time, in some Western countries, unemployment is increasing, and an economic crisis that brings further suffering to young people is approaching. As a result of the deteriorating economy, 200,000 students in the United States have been forced to discontinue their studies. The Executive Committee emphasized that despite the divisive activities of reactionaries, the unity of the IUS has been further strengthened. The Executive Committee reaffirmed its previous decision to hold an International Youth and Student Festival in Budapest in August this year, in conjunction with the World Federation of Democratic Youth. The International Youth and Student Festival will be held under the slogan "Youth Unite in the Struggle for Peace, Democracy, National Independence, and a Better Future."

　　国际学联执委会闭幕
  　决定声援殖民地学生运动日
    【新华社陕北二十九日电】塔斯社布拉格二十六日讯：国际学联执委会会议业已闭幕。执委会讨论并通过了国际学联书记处的报告，通过了若干关于国际学联进一步活动的决定。执委会在闭幕会议上又通过向中国，希腊及拉丁美洲各国民主青年致敬的电报；并决定国际学联所属一切全国性的青年组织，应于一九四九年二月二十一日举行声援各殖民地与附属国民主学生运动日。执委会在决定中指出：希腊、西班牙及各殖民地与附属国学生与青年的处境正在恶化中。同时，在若干西方国家中，失业正在增长，给青年带来进一步苦难的经济危机正在迫近。由于经济恶化的结果，美国二十万学生已被迫停学。执委会力称：尽管反动分子在进行分裂活动，但国际学联的团结业已进一步加强。执委会重申其过去关于会同国际民主青年联盟于今年八月在布达佩斯举行国际青年及学生节的决定。国际青年及学生节将在“青年们在争取和平、民主、民族独立与美好前途的斗争中团结起来”这一口号下举行。
