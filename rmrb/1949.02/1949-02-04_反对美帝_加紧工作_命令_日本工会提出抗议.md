Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, February 2nd: According to a report by the Dentong News Agency: The leaders of Japan's two largest trade unions—the Japanese Federation of Industrial Labor Unions and the Japanese Confederation of Labor—have protested to the American occupation authorities against the order to "intensify work" issued by them. In order to implement the United States' plan to "stabilize" the Japanese economy, MacArthur Headquarters convened a meeting of representatives from both labor and management in Japan on January 27th and 28th, forcing Japanese trade unions to abandon demands for further wage adjustments within 48 hours. At the same time, they had to guarantee increased industrial production, and union leaders were not allowed to express their opinions in detail or make any reservations. According to union leaders, the American occupation authorities' eagerness to force the labor side to agree to the American plan for Japan was to welcome US Secretary of the Army Royall and his financial advisor, banker Dodge, who set off for Japan on January 28th, in order to show that labor and management seemed unanimously determined to support the plan. However, this deployment by the American occupation authorities has gone bankrupt. The two-day "labor-management meeting" ended without result on the 28th. According to Agence France-Presse, during the meeting, the Federation of Industrial Labor Unions demanded the revision of the current anti-labor law and announced that it reserved the right to strike for wage increases. After the meeting, the chairman of the Federation of Industrial Labor Unions, Kaido Fuku, issued a statement, once again putting forward demands such as establishing a minimum wage system, abolishing taxes on the working masses, and establishing a social insurance system funded by capitalists. In order to adapt to the sentiments of the working masses, the representatives of the Confederation of Labor also expressed their opposition to the establishment of a fascist-like "Industrial Patriotic Association" like the one during the war.

　　反对美帝“加紧工作”命令
  　日本工会提出抗议
    【新华社陕北二日电】据电通社报导：日本两个最大的工会——日本产业劳动组合联合会与日本劳动总同盟的领袖，已向美国占领当局抗议其所颁布的“加紧工作”的命令。按麦克阿瑟总部为了执行美国的“稳定”日本经济计划，曾于一月二十七、二十八两日，召集日本劳资双方代表开会，强迫日本工会应在四十八小时内放弃进一步调整工资的要求，同时必须保证增加工业生产，且不让工会领袖详尽地表示他们的意见及作任何保留。据工会领袖称：美国占领当局之急于强迫劳工方面同意美国对日的计划，是为了迎接于一月二十八日动身对日的美陆长罗雅尔及其财政顾问银行家陶奇，为了表示劳资双方似乎已一致决心支持该计划。然而，美国占领当局这一部署，已告破产。两天的“劳资会议”已于二十八日无结果而散。据法新社消息，在会议进行时，产业劳动组合联合会即要求修改目前的反劳工法，并宣布保留为要求增加工资而进行罢工的权利。会议结束后，产业劳动组合联合会主席管道复发表声明，再次提出确定最低工资制度，废除向工人群众征税，建立由资本家出资供给的社会保险制度等要求。劳动总同盟代表为了适应工人群众的情绪，也表示反对建立象战时那种法西斯的“产业报国会的组织”。
