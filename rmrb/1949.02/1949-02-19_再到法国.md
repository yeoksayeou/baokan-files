　　Back to France Again
　　Liu Ningyi
　　The French worker brothers are very concerned about the victory of the Chinese people. They said: The struggle of the Chinese working class is for the Chinese people and also for us French people!
    
　　　　What has the Marshall Plan given the French people?
　　Last year (1947) I went to France, and an egg cost eight francs; this year (1949 - same below) I went to France again, and it cost thirty-two francs. Last year a meal cost seventy francs, this year three hundred francs. Last year the official exchange rate for the US dollar was 1 to 120; this year it has become three types: foreign exchange 250, official price 310, and black market 460. Last year, the wages of workers, skilled workers, were 8,000 francs per month. After the general strike in November, it increased by 3,000. However, the income tax of workers, after the restoration, was added to one-tenth of the salary; the increase of 3,000 was hardly enough to pay taxes. This year, prices continue to soar, but workers' wages have not increased at all. The major coal mine strike since September demanded a minimum wage of 12,000 francs. The government sent troops to suppress it, used force everywhere, fired at workers, and forcibly occupied the mines, resulting in many bloody incidents.
    
　　Clothes, shoes, and food (except noodles) rationing have been cancelled, but fewer people are buying them because they can't afford them. A pair of leather shoes, officially priced at 500 francs during rationing and 1,200 francs on the black market, has now risen to 4,000 or 5,000. Parisians are usually very particular about their appearance, but now the general poor residents are also dressed in rags and are very embarrassed.
    
　　American commodity dumping has come in. In the past, it was difficult to buy Parker ink, watches, and cellophane raincoats, but now they are everywhere. France is short of coal. Originally, it wanted to convert trains to electric power, but now the plan has been cancelled; automobile manufacturing has also been restricted, and airplane factories have also been reduced to a large extent. Because the Marshall Aid Plan stipulates that a large number of Ford cars and American airplanes must be imported. Large factories have contracts with the United States to share the spoils; small and medium-sized factories are closing down or changing industries, industrial capital is being converted into commercial capital, and the number of unemployed workers has increased by more than 2 million.
    
　　France's national treasury is becoming increasingly strained, and the invasion war in Vietnam has been repeatedly defeated and is difficult to sustain.
    
　　The American Harriman (Director of the "Economic Cooperation" Administration) is virtually an emperor in France. It is said that after the fall of the Schuman cabinet, the French Socialist Party was once in chaos, and the people demanded that the French Communist Party participate in the cabinet. In order to stabilize the people's hearts, the Socialist Party was wavering; at this time, the United States came out to interfere, saying that if the French government had Communist participation, the Marshall Plan would be suspended. The Socialist Party and the Radical Socialist Party then hurriedly stated that they were still anti-communist. The people can see clearly that the French government is not independent and is controlled by the United States economically, politically, and militarily. In September, the sentiment of the French people against the traitorous government was high. The US embassy and the French government also made a public statement about this, making a "this place does not contain silver" explanation. In terms of the labor movement, the General Confederation of Labor of France was originally a powerful unified workers' organization. In order to undermine the unity of the workers, the French reactionary government instructed the labor traitor Shih Wu to carry out a year of divisive work. The American yellow union, the American Federation of Labor, also sent representatives to reside in France for this purpose, using 2 million US dollars on Shih Wu's "Worker Strength" (the name of the French breakaway union). Not only did it not work, but the influence of the right wing was weakening day by day. Even Marshall himself had to come to Paris to give Shih Wu concrete instructions.
    
　　The French reactionary government publicly regarded itself as an anti-Soviet vanguard in front of its American master. De Gaulle took two or three hundred guards to the south to give speeches. The people opposed it. De Gaulle even carried out a massacre, killing dozens of ordinary people, and ran back to Paris. Under the manipulation of the United States, Britain, France, Belgium, the Netherlands, and Luxembourg organized a five-nation military alliance. Due to uneven distribution of spoils, they quarreled and argued. The United States shamelessly proposed that this military group should be equipped with American weapons, on the one hand to sell military goods, and on the other hand to strengthen its control over the national defense of the five countries. Although France tried its best to please the United States, the United States did not believe it, thinking that when war was declared against the Soviet Union, France and Italy would quickly become the world of the Communist Party, and West Germany and Spain were more reliable. Although the French reactionaries frantically shouted anti-Soviet and anti-communist slogans, the American master's assessment of it was very low.
    
　　Indeed, France, economically, militarily, and politically, is like the autumn plane tree leaves on the streets of Paris, withering and falling.
    
　　　　The People are rising!
　　However, the flames of popular resistance are gradually burning, growing larger and larger, and have become an unstoppable prairie fire. Since June of last year until now, strikes have not stopped, rising one after another, becoming increasingly intensified.
    
　　On the evening of September 22, the day the World Federation of Trade Unions Executive Bureau meeting closed, Comrade Frachon, General Secretary of the General Confederation of Labor of France (member of the French Communist Party), hosted a dinner for friends from democratic countries. He gave an impromptu speech saying:
    
　　"Comrades, for the common cause of workers all over the world, democracy and peace, you have come here from afar to hold a meeting. Today, we express our warmest welcome.
    
　　The people of France are fighting for our lives and the independence and freedom of our country. It has been decided to hold a national strike for two hours tomorrow afternoon at four o'clock. Our struggle is inseparable from the anti-American struggle and the democratic and peaceful struggle of the whole world. Our struggle is not isolated.
    
　　Here are representatives from the Soviet Union. Soviet workers are fighting for the post-war five-year plan and striving to defend human democracy and peace. The French workers will always be friendly to the incomparably powerful Soviet people.
    
　　Here are representatives from China. Their liberation struggle has persisted for more than 20 years, and now there are vast liberated areas, and the victory reports of the anti-American and Chiang struggle are frequently reported...
    
　　Comrades, raise your glasses and wish for the permanent unity of workers all over the world and the defense of democracy and peace!"
    
　　Comrade Kuznetsov, the Soviet representative, gave a thank-you speech. Then Comrade Frachon asked me to say a few words. What I said was:
    
　　"Thank you very much to Frachon and all the comrades of the French General Confederation of Labor for the warm reception. Speaking of this World Federation of Trade Unions meeting, it is true that there are no results, but the workers' movement and the people's struggle all over the world are always moving forward and there are results. The American imperialists also used 460 million US dollars of military supplies to arm Chiang Kai-shek, trying to enslave all the Chinese people, but the Chinese people, under the leadership of Chairman Mao of the Chinese Communist Party, have become more united. After two years of struggle, they have eliminated more than 2.8 million of Chiang's bandit troops, liberated more than 2.3 million square kilometers of land, and have 168 million people. They took those American weapons and armed themselves. The people of the whole country have risen up, and now there is no city that cannot be captured. This is the power of the unity of workers and the people. This year's Sixth Labor Congress also decided to produce more military supplies to support the front line, finally eliminate the Chiang Kai-shek group, abolish all the traitorous treaties of the Chiang Kai-shek government, and strive for the final liberation of the working class and the people of the whole country. I wish the workers of the whole world unite and struggle, and may the victory of liberation last forever!"
    
　　The comrades were so excited, paying tribute to the Chinese people's liberation struggle together!
    
　　　　A trip to Marseille
　　The International Industrial Exhibition was held in Marseille. Taking this opportunity, the Marseille Trade Union also held an international trade union exhibition, one part of which was "China in the War of Liberation," displaying large photos explaining the power of the people and the captured American weapons. The Marseille Trade Union also convened a mass meeting and invited representatives from the World Federation of Trade Unions to attend. Those invited to attend included the Secretary-General of the World Federation of Trade Unions, Saillant, representatives from Italy, South America, and Republican Spain, and me, a total of five people.
    
　　This is a port with a revolutionary history. During the Great Revolution, the people of Marseille organized a powerful team. To this day, the French national anthem is still called the Marseillaise, which is the march of this combat group in Marseille. To this day, the workers' organization and combativeness here are still very strong. During the general strike in November last year, the workers here beat the reactionary mayor, and the soldiers here also participated in parades and demonstrations. The reactionary government had no way to deal with them. Not far northwest of Marseille, passing through mountains and pine forests, you can see a building. It was originally a concentration camp during the German occupation and was converted into a sanatorium for seamen and dockworkers. This was done by the workers themselves after the liberation of France. You can see how powerful the seamen workers here are. More than 200 workers are often recuperating here, and more than 80 children are studying, raising pigs and chickens, and there is also a winery. An old seaman said:
    
　　"This used to be a dark hell, but with our workers' struggle, it has been turned into a paradise. But this small place alone is not enough. The French workers must also transform the whole of France."
    
　　The trade union took us to visit the shipyard and took a boat around the harbor. Martyrs' portraits of those who sacrificed to resist Germany were hung everywhere. They will never forget the blood shed by French workers for independence and freedom.
    
　　The evening meeting began, and the masses had already filled the venue. We went by car, and along the way we saw more than 500 armed police patrolling the streets, but the meeting was still enthusiastically opened.
    
　　Saillant promoted: "Now some bureaucrats in France, the United States, Britain, and China are holding a United Nations meeting in Paris. They rejected Vishinsky's peace proposal. They cannot represent any people. They can only give the people the threat of war, only hunger, only death! The real French workers, Chinese workers, Spanish workers, and South American workers are here. We unanimously want democracy and peace. Workers all over the world have seen the victory of economic construction in the Soviet Union and new democratic countries. People's lives are improving day by day, proving that people can build their own happy countries. The Marshall's aggressive plan can only give France the poverty and oppression it has encountered and only support the crimes committed by Chiang Kai-shek and Franco. Now the people of France see clearly that we want a good government to protect the independence of the country, improve the lives of the people, and insist on opposing American aggression. All members of the World Federation of Trade Unions, unite and refuse to transport the goods of American imperialism!"
    
　　Representatives from various countries spoke, and various trade unions in Marseille presented flowers and gifts to representatives from various countries to pay their respects. The meeting closed in the high singing of the Internationale.
    
　　　　The 27th French Workers' Congress
　　The coal miners of France, in order to fight for the right to live, demanded an increase in wages, and set off a raging strike wave, and workers everywhere rose up to help. On October 9, the French construction workers held a representative conference. Saillant said: "Go there, this is the trade union I organized myself. They are very international and welcome Chinese comrades to tell them about the situation of the struggle in China." I went and made a simple speech, seeing that all their preparations were to welcome the National Workers' Congress, the enthusiasm of the masses was indeed very high, and they were really friendly to China.
    
　　On the morning of October 11, in the Palace of Versailles, 2,500 representatives of workers from all over France stood up together in the surge of the Internationale, and the 27th National Congress of French Workers opened. Representatives from the American Coal Miners Union, the Netherlands, Belgium, Spain, Italy, Czechoslovakia, Hungary, Poland, China, and the American Seamen were invited to attend the meeting and were introduced one by one. The first chairman was elected Secretary of the French Coal Miners Union. He made a painful and magnificent opening speech. The whole audience stood up to pay tribute to and support the coal miners. Frachon gave a general report, describing the struggle in the past year. He said:
    
　　"All these struggles are to oppose the aggression of American imperialism, the oppression of the reactionary French government, and the exploitation of the two hundred families. The power of international workers is growing day by day. The reactionary labor traitors are carrying out divisive activities with the support of American monopoly capitalists, but in France, the victors are not the separatists but the unity of the General Confederation of Labor. In the coal miners' strike, in the train workers' strike, in the organizations of various factories, the "Worker Strength" and Catholic trade union workers automatically joined the General Confederation of Labor and participated in the joint action. Our future work is to win over more workers and masses, unity is strength, and winning a member is a strength. Our requirement is the minimum wage increased according to the cost of living index. It is enough for the big capitalists to take only one-tenth of the net profit to improve the wages of workers across the country; but they refuse to do so, but for selfish purposes, they sell out national sovereignty, collude with American imperialism, and oppose workers, anti-Soviet and anti-communist. Only the Soviet Union is our friend, and only the Communist Party is our leader. The reactionaries rely on Marshall. Shih Wu shamelessly accepted Marshall's feeding. Where will he lead our workers? This is the leadership of the Socialist Party, which is selling out the motherland and the working class.
    
　　After a year of struggle, we have learned a tactical lesson. In the future, we should not easily have a general strike. We want to strike in one place after another, one industry after another, rising one after another, continuously, and use various forces to support the victory of a strike.
    
　　We had mistakes in the past and should self-criticize:
    
　　First, we committed tailism, falling behind the demands of the masses and failing to take the initiative to put forward the demands of the masses in a timely manner.
    
　　Second, subjectivism, deciding on a strategy, failing to mobilize the masses to discuss it, and failing to accept the opinions of the masses in a timely manner.
    
　　Third, the work of young women is not enough.
    
　　We must admit our mistakes to the masses. Don't be afraid of being scolded. If the scolding is right, we must correct it immediately. We admit our mistakes openly, don't be embarrassed, this is the attitude that the proletariat should have."
    
　　The next day, Liabo gave an international report, and Saillant gave a report on the development of the world workers' movement.
    
　　Representatives from various countries gave speeches to the conference. When the Chinese representative spoke, the whole audience stood up and sang the Internationale, and the applause lasted for a long time.
    
　　Humanity Daily, Worker's Daily, and military magazines, there are news about China almost every day. The French worker brothers are very concerned about the victory of the Chinese people. Frachon said:
    
　　"The struggle of the Chinese working class is for the Chinese people, and also for us French people!"
    
　　On the evening of October 15, the conference closed. The whole of France had been swept into the atmosphere of the great coal miners' strike, and the train workers held a sympathy strike, and workers from various industries donated to help. This wave spread to Belgium, Britain, Italy, and Eastern Europe, where donations were being raised everywhere to help.
    
　　That night, the General Confederation of Labor of France said goodbye to the representatives of various countries. They were reluctant to leave each other and talked until midnight. Everyone did not sleep. At four o'clock in the morning, the representatives of various countries took a plane sent by the Hungarian Trade Union and flew to Budapest. Because those brothers were waiting there to participate in the opening ceremony of their Seventh National Workers' Congress.

### 再到法国

专栏：

　　再到法国
    刘宁一
    法国的工人兄弟们，非常关心中国人民的胜利，他们说：中国工人阶级的斗争，是为了中国人民，也是为了我们法兰西人民！
    　　　　马歇尔计划给了法国人民一些什么？
    去年（一九四七）一月我到了法国，鸡蛋一个卖八法郎；今年（一九四九——下同）又到了法国，就卖到三十二法郎了。去年一顿饭七十个法郎，今年三百个法郎。去年美金汇率官价一比一百二；今年变成了三种：外汇二五○、官价三一○、黑市四六○。去年工人工资，技术工人月薪八千法郎，十一月总罢工后增加了三千。但是工人所得税，复兴后，左加右加，加到了工资的十分之一；所增三千，几乎不够纳税。今年物价继续飞涨，而工人的工资至今未加分毫。今年九月以来的煤矿大罢工，要求最低工资一万二千法郎，政府派兵镇压，到处动武，向工人开枪，并强占矿井，致发生流血惨案多起。
    衣服，鞋子，吃饭（除面以外），配给票取消了，但是买的人更少了，因为都买不起了。一双皮鞋，配给时官价五百，黑市一千二，现在涨到了四千、五千。最讲漂亮是巴黎人，现在一般贫苦居民也是衣服褴褛，狼狈的很。
    美国的商品倾销进来了，过去买派克墨水，手表，玻璃雨衣是困难的，现在到处都是了。法国缺煤，原来想将火车改为电动，现在计划也取消了；汽车制造也限制了，飞机工厂也缩减了一大部分。因为马歇尔援助计划规定要输入大量的福特汽车与美国飞机。大工厂和美国有了合同，互相分赃；中小工厂关门的关门，改业的改业，工业资本变为商业资本，失业工人因此增加了二百多万人。
    法国的国库支出日窘，越南侵略战事屡战屡败，难以支持。
    美国的霍尔曼（“经济合作”总署署长）在法国俨然太上皇。据说舒曼内阁倒台之后，法国社会党一度陷于混乱，人民都要求法共参加内阁，社会党为安定人心计，已在动摇；这时美国就出来干涉，说法国政府如有共产党参加，马歇尔计划就将停止执行。社会党、急进社会党于是连忙表示还是反共。人民是看得清楚，法国政府不是独立的，在经济上在政治上在军事上都被美国控制着。九月间，法人民反卖国政府的情绪高涨，美大使馆及法政府还为此作了公开声明，作了“此地无银三百两”的辩解。工运方面，法总工会本是一个强大的工人统一组织，法反动政府为破坏工人的团结，曾指使工贼石屋进行了一年的分裂工作，美国黄色工会劳联亦为此派代表常驻法国，在石屋的“工人力量”（法分裂派工会的名字）身上用了二百万美金，不但未见成效，右派的影响反而日见削弱了，甚至马歇尔也不得不亲自来巴黎给石屋以具体的指示。
    法反动政府在美国主子面前，公然以反苏先锋自居。戴高乐带着二三百个卫士到南方讲演，人民反对，戴高乐竟然进行屠杀，打死了几十个老百姓，又跑回巴黎。在美国操纵下，英法比荷卢组织了五国军事同盟，内部分赃不均，吵来吵去。美国又公然无耻的提出，这一军事集团要以美国武器来装备，一方面推销军火，一方面加强对五国国防的控制。法国虽一个劲向美讨好，美国却不相信它，认为当对苏开战时，法国意大利会很快变成共产党的世界，还是西德和西班牙靠得住一点。法国反动派虽狂喊反苏反共，美国主子对它的估价却很低很低。
    的确，法国在经济上，在军事上，在政治上，都和巴黎街上秋天的梧桐叶儿一样，由衰残到枯落了。
    　　　　人民起来了！
    但是，人民反抗的烈火却逐渐的燃烧起来，越烧越大，已成了不可扑灭的燎原大火。自去年六月到现在，罢工就没有停止过，彼伏此起，日益加剧。
    今年九月二十二日的晚上，世界工联执行局会议闭幕的那一天，法总工会总书记佛拉商同志（法共党员）招待民主国诸好友会餐，他即席致词说：
    “同志们，你们为了全世界工人的共同事业，民主与和平，很远地到这里来开会，我们今天表示十分的热烈的欢迎。
    法国的人民，正在为着我们的生活、我们国家的独立自由而斗争。明天下午四点决定全国罢工两小时。我们的斗争和全世界的反美斗争，民主和平斗争，是分不开的。我们的斗争不是孤立的。
    这里有苏联的代表，苏联工人在为战后五年计划而奋斗，为保卫人类的民主和平而努力。法国工人永远和无比强大的苏联人民友好。
    这里有中国的代表，他们的解放斗争，已坚持了二十多年，现在有广大的解放区，而且反美蒋斗争的胜利捷报频传，……
    同志们举起杯来，祝全世界工人的永久团结，保卫民主和平！”
    苏联代表库兹涅佐夫同志致了谢词，接着佛拉商同志要我讲几句话，我说的是：
    “很感谢法总工会佛拉商和各同志的热烈招待。提到此次世界工联会议，的确是没有结果，但是全世界的工人运动人民的斗争，是永远向前进，而且是有结果。美帝国主义者也曾以四十六万万美金的军火武装援助蒋介石，想奴役全中国人民，但是中国人民在中国共产党毛主席领导之下，更加团结起来，经过了两年斗争，消灭了蒋匪军二百八十余万，解放了二百三十余万平方公里的土地，拥有一万万六千八百万人口，把那些美国武器夺取过来武装了自己，全国人民起来了，现在没有不能克复的城市，这是工人和人民团结的力量。今年八月六次劳大更决定了多生产军火支援前线，最后消灭蒋介石集团，取消蒋介石政府一切卖国条约，争取工人阶级和全国人民的最后解放。我敬祝全世界的工人阶级团结斗争，解放胜利万岁！”
    同志们是那样的兴奋，齐为中国人民解放斗争致敬！
    　　　　马赛之行
    国际工业展览会在马赛举行，趁此机会马赛工会也举行一个各国工会展览会，其中有一部是“解放战争中的中国”，陈列着大的照片，说明着人民的力量，和缴获的美国武器。马赛工会并召开一个群众大会，且请世界工联派代表出席。应邀出席的一行有世界工联总书记赛扬，意大利、南美、共和西班牙的代表和我，共五个人。
    这是一个有革命历史的港口，大革命时，马赛人民曾组织过一支有力的队伍，至今法国的国歌还叫马赛曲，这是马赛这个战斗集团的进行曲。至今此地工人的组织与斗争性还是很强的，去年十一月大罢工，这里的工人打了反动市长，这里的军人也参加了游行示威，反动政府对他们完全没有办法。离马赛西北不远，走过山地和松林，就看到一座楼房，德国占领时原是一个集中营，改作了海员码头工人休养所，这是法国解放之后工人自己干起来的，可以看到这里海员工人是如何的有力量。这里经常有工人二百余名休养，和八十多个儿童读书，养着猪和鸡，还有一个造酒坊。一个老海员说：
    “这里原是一个黑暗的地狱，以我们工人的斗争，改成了乐园。但光这一个小小地方还不算，法国工人还得要改造整个法兰西。”
    工会带我们参观了船坞，和乘船周游了海港，到处挂着抗德牺牲的烈士像，他们永远不会忘记法国工人为了独立自由所流的鲜血。
    晚间大会开始了，群众已经充满了会场，我们乘着汽车去了，沿路看到五百多名武装警察，沿街巡逻，但是会依然是热烈的开幕了。
    赛扬宣传了“现在法国的美国的英国的中国的一些官僚们正在巴黎开联合国会议，他们拒绝了维辛斯基的和平提议，他们不能代表任何人民，他们给与人民的只有战争的威胁，只有饥饿，只有死亡！真正法国工人，中国工人，西班牙的工人，南美的工人代表在这里。我们一致的要民主要和平。全世界的工人已经看到了苏联和新民主主义国家经济建设的胜利，人民生活逐日在提高，证明人民自己可以建设自己的幸福的国家。而马歇尔的侵略计划，只能给与法国所遭遇的穷困与压迫，只是支持蒋介石和佛郎哥之流所干的罪恶。现在法国的人民看清楚了，我们要一个好的政府，保卫国家的独立，改善人民的生活，坚持反对美国的侵略。世界工联所有的会员们，联合起来，拒运美帝国主义的货物！”
    各国代表讲了话，马赛各工会向各国代表献花送礼致敬，在高唱国际歌声中闭会。
    　　　　法国第二十七次工人代表大会
    法国的煤矿工人，为了争取生活的权利，要求增加工资，卷起了如火如荼的罢工浪潮，到处工人都起而援助。十月九日那天，法国建筑工人召开了代表大会，赛扬说：“你去一下吧，这是我自己组织的工会，他们是十分有国际思想的，很欢迎中国同志去告诉他们中国的斗争形势。”我去了作了一段简单的发言，看他们一切准备都是迎接全国工人代表大会的，群众的热情的确很高，对中国真是友好。
    十月十一日清晨，在凡尔赛大厦里，全法工人的二千五百个代表，在国际歌的声浪中一齐站立起来，第二十七次全法工人代表大会开幕了。被邀列席会议的有美国煤矿工会、荷、比、西班牙、意大利、捷、匈、波、中和美国海员等代表，一一作了介绍。第一个主席是选了法国煤矿总工会书记，他做了沉痛壮烈的开幕辞，全场起立，向煤矿工人致敬声援。佛拉商作了总报告，叙述一年来斗争经过。他说：
    “这一切斗争都是为了反对美帝国主义的侵略，法反动政府的压迫，二百家族的剥削。国际工人的力量日益生长，反动工贼在美国独占资本家支持之下进行分裂活动，但在法国，胜利的不是分裂者而是总工会的团结。在煤矿工人罢工中，在火车工人罢工中，各厂组织中，“工人力量”的、天主教工会的工人都自动的参加了总工会，参加了共同行动。我们今后的工作，要争取更多的工人群众，团结就是力量，争取一个会员，就是一分力量。我们的要求是依生活指数而增加的最低工资，大资本家所赚的钱只要拿出纯利十分之一就足够改善全国的工人的工资；但他们偏不这样做，却为了自私目的而出卖国家主权，勾结美帝国主义，反对工人，反苏反共。只有苏联才是我们的朋友，只有共产党才是我们的领导者。反动派依靠马歇尔，石屋观颜无理的接受了马歇尔的饲养，把我们工人领导到什么地方去？这是社会党的领导，是出卖祖国与工人阶级的。
    我们经过一年的斗争，得到了一个策略上的教训，今后不要轻易总罢工，我们要一个地方一个地方，一个产业一个产业的罢工，彼起此伏，陆续不绝，以各种力量支持一个罢工的胜利。
    我们过去有错误，应该自我批评：
    第一、我们犯了尾巴主义，落到群众要求的后面，未及时主动提出群众的要求。
    第二、主观主义，决定一个策略，未动员群众讨论，未及时接受群众意见。
    第三、青年妇女工作作的太不够。
    我们要向群众承认错误，人家骂不要怕，如果骂的对就要马上纠正。我们有错误公开承认，不要难为情，这才是无产阶级应有的态度。”
    次日，利亚波作了国际报告，赛扬作了世界工人运动的发展报告。
    各国代表都向大会致词。中国代表发言时，全体起立唱国际歌，掌声久久不息。
    人道报、工人报、军事杂志，中国的消息几乎每天都有，法国的工人兄弟们，对于中国人民的胜利是非常关心的。佛拉商说：
    “中国工人阶级的斗争，是为了中国人民，也是为了我们法兰西人民！”
    十月十五日晚，大会闭幕了，全法已卷入了煤矿工人大罢工的气氛中，火车工人举行同情罢工，各业工人募捐援助。这个声浪传到了比国、英国、意大利、东欧，到处募捐援助。
    当晚，法总工会与各国代表话别，彼此恋恋，谈叙至夜半，大家都没有睡觉。到了四点多钟，各国代表乘匈牙利工会派来的飞机，飞向布达佩斯去了。因为那里在等待着这些兄弟们去参加他们的第七次全国工人代表大会开幕典礼。
