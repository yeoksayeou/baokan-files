　　US Imperialism's Series of New Aggressive Deployments
  　Again Suffers Head-on Blow from the Democratic Camp
　　US imperialism is currently actively pursuing its conspiracy to dominate the world – the "North Atlantic Alliance." This alliance is expected to be formally established in March. Currently, the US, UK, Canada, France, the Netherlands, Belgium, and Luxembourg are participating in this "alliance," and there are plans to drag in Sweden, Norway, Denmark, Italy, Portugal, Switzerland, and even Franco's Spain in the future. This so-called alliance is an expansion of the five-nation alliance of the UK, France, the Netherlands, Belgium, and Luxembourg, which was signed in Brussels last March as the foundation of the "Western European Bloc," and is another step by the United States to enslave the people of the world and prepare for a new war. Under the leadership of the United States, the tripartite meeting of the UK, US, and France on the "German Occupation Statute," which began in London in early January, although not progressing smoothly, is still continuing intermittently under the pressure of the United States. The purpose of this meeting is to completely merge the three occupation zones of West Germany, organize a unified West German puppet government, and ultimately complete the division of Germany, turning the entire West Germany into the main base of American aggression in Europe.
　　At the same time, British and American imperialism are carrying out a series of other conspiratorial activities in Asia. After the imperialist aggressive lines were breached in many parts of the world, especially in China, they are frantically building defenses in other places in the East. British High Commissioner MacDonald began a three-day meeting with the governors of British colonies in Southeast Asia in Singapore on January 21 to discuss the so-called "ways and means of closer cooperation between them" (Associated Press). The "Southeast Asia Group" instigated by the United States did not achieve its purpose at the "Asian Conference" held in India, and is now preparing to hold a similar conference in the Philippines in an attempt to continue to establish this counter-revolutionary group. At the same time, US Secretary of the Army Royall led a group of aggressive murderers, arriving in Japan on the 1st to "inspect" Korea and the Pacific Islands. One of the main tasks of their trip is to "discuss the changing situation in China" with MacArthur and others and to "build Japan into an anti-communist fortress" (Reuters).
　　The US's intensified efforts to establish the "North Atlantic Alliance" and its series of new deployments of aggressive policies have once again suffered a head-on blow from the democratic camp led by the Soviet Union. The Soviet Ministry of Foreign Affairs issued a lengthy statement on January 28 regarding the "North Atlantic Alliance Treaty," thoroughly exposing that this alliance is a tool used by the US and British ruling groups to achieve aggression and launch new wars, and a weapon for them to directly undermine the United Nations. The statement quoted Stalin's conclusion, once again pointing out that aggressors who attempt to launch new wars cannot overcome the power of the masses of people who advocate peace, and it is impossible to turn this power into a new war. The statement solemnly declared that the Soviet Union will "carry out a more vigorous and resolute struggle against all warmongers, against the policy of aggression and launching new wars, and for democracy and lasting peace throughout the world."
　　For this purpose, Stalin, Chairman of the Council of Ministers of the Soviet Union, successively published two important documents on January 30 and February 2, answering questions raised by Smith, the European director of the American International News Service, on the issue of US-Soviet relations. In the documents, Stalin stated that the Soviet government is willing to prepare and the US government to issue a joint statement, affirming that each government has no intention of resorting to war to oppose each other, and the Soviet government is willing to cooperate with the US government to take measures aimed at gradually reducing armaments. Regarding the Berlin issue, Stalin pointed out that if the US, UK, and France abide by delaying the independent establishment of a West German state and lifting restrictions on transportation and trade to East Germany before convening a foreign ministers' conference to comprehensively review the German issue, then the Soviet government is also willing to prepare to lift transportation restrictions between Berlin and West Germany. Stalin also announced that he does not oppose holding a meeting with Truman on peace treaties and welcomed Truman to the Soviet Union, Poland, or Czechoslovakia to discuss. Stalin's magnificent voice against new wars and resolutely defending democracy and peace has been endorsed by all peace-loving people around the world, but Acheson and Truman have declared their rejection.
　　For the same anti-aggression purpose, the Soviet government issued a statement on January 29, requesting the Norwegian government, which intends to join the "North Atlantic Alliance," to clarify its position on the alliance. Prior to this, the people of Northern Europe had risen up and shouted: "We don't want this alliance!" A grand rally was held in Oslo, the capital of Norway, on January 28, unanimously passing a resolution protesting Norway's attempt to join the North Atlantic Alliance.
　　The movement for peace is also developing in other parts of the world. The French Communist Party and the General Confederation of Labor and other eighteen democratic groups called on the French people to hold a national demonstration on the 13th to "fight for bread, peace, freedom, and independence." On January 30, the National Council of American-Soviet Friendship in New York summoned the American people to stand up and stop this war-mongering "North Atlantic Alliance." The German Socialist Unity Party Congress, which opened in Berlin on January 25, passed a declaration before closing on the 28th, fiercely opposing the "Occupation Statute" that American and British imperialism is trying to impose on the German people, calling on the German people to fight against the imperialist policy of dividing and enslaving Germany and to fight against the camp of reaction and war. The Congress was full of confidence in the future of a peaceful, democratic, and unified Germany, and excitedly pointed out in a congratulatory telegram celebrating the great victory of the Chinese people's liberation cause: The victory of the Chinese people "strengthens the strength of the German people in their own struggle" and "strengthens the German people's confidence in the final victory of the democratic and peaceful forces over the imperialist warmongers and reactionaries."
　　The national liberation movements in three Asian countries are still heroically persevering or developing victoriously. In Vietnam, according to the headquarters of the Viet Minh Army, the Vietnamese people will achieve greater victories in the war of independence this year. The Council of Ministers of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam, presided over by President Ho Chi Minh, recently issued a communiqué, calling on the Vietnamese people to mobilize all forces and resources to launch a full-scale offensive against the remnants of French imperialism and its running dogs on Vietnamese territory in order to achieve Vietnam's true independence. Seeing that the colonial century is about to end in Vietnam, American imperialism is playing new tricks again, calling on the French reactionaries to bring out the deposed Vietnamese Emperor Bao Dai to serve as a puppet emperor again, trying to use this old signboard to deceive the Vietnamese people. This conspiracy has been severely warned by Ho Chi Minh: If Bao Dai betrays his oath when he abdicated that he would no longer betray the people, he "will be subject to the punishment deserved by traitors." In Indonesia, since Dutch imperialism launched a barbaric new offensive on December 19 last year, it has been a month and a half now. Although a large number of leaders of the Indonesian traitorous government, whether captured or not, have mostly surrendered, the Indonesian people's anti-Dutch armed forces have grown stronger in the struggle. Agence France-Presse said on January 26: Currently, there are 300,000 anti-Dutch guerrillas, and they are also supported by armed youth organizations. The flames of guerrilla warfare are burning everywhere, and the Dutch aggressor troops are exhausted to cope. Even the UN Security Council's Indonesian "conciliation" committee had to admit in its report on January 24 that the Indonesian "situation is extremely unstable," that "Dutch troops dare not go deep, and serious disturbances have occurred in several points." The Dutch reactionary authorities also had to publicly announce that they will continue to increase troops to Indonesia and continue to fight the guerrillas for three months. In Malaya, people's guerrillas continue to frequently attack highways, railways, and mines. The operations of the people's guerrillas have gained the support of the broad masses of the people. British Chronicle reporter Lember reported after traveling in various parts of Malaya recently: The British situation is worsening. He admitted: "The rebels (referring to the people's guerrillas) are highly efficient in combat." British Army Commander Boucher in Malaya said anxiously and distressedly: "As long as the people continue to help the 'rebels' with food and information, and as long as the representatives of all communities do not cooperate with the government, the state of emergency will continue as before, and no matter how many troops are of no avail."
　　Other more important international events recently are as follows:
　　(1) The People's Independent Front was established in Hungary. This is a fighting alliance of all democratic forces based on the worker-peasant alliance, led by the working class and its party, the Working People's Party. The main task of this front is to unite the country's democratic forces on the basis of the new situation at home and abroad, defend peace and national independence, and ensure the construction of a new country truly belonging to the working people.
　　(2) The Japanese Communist Party is leading the establishment of the Japanese People's Democratic Front. The JCP has made this proposal to the Socialist Party and the Labor-Farmer Party on January 28, which has gained the support of the broad masses of working people and the lower-level party members of the Socialist Party, but the reactionary leadership organs of the Socialist Party, headed by Tetsu Katayama, decided to reject this proposal of the JCP.

　　美帝一系列的侵略新部署
  　又遭到民主阵营迎头痛击
    美帝国主义最近正积极进行其企图统治世界的阴谋计划——“北大西洋联盟”。这一联盟或将在三月间正式建立。参加这个“联盟”的，目前有美、英、加、法、荷、比、卢七国，以后还准备把瑞（典）、挪、丹、意、葡、士甚至佛朗哥西班牙都拖进去。这个所谓联盟，是去年三月在布鲁塞尔签订的作为“西欧集团”基础的英、法、荷、比、卢五国联盟的扩大，是美国奴役世界人民和准备新战争的又一个步骤。在美国领导之下，于一月初旬在伦敦开始的英、美、法三国关于“德国占领法规”的会议，虽谈得不很顺利，但在美国的压迫下至今仍在断断续续地进行。这个会议的目的，就是要把西德的三个占领区完全合并，组织统一的西德傀儡政府，就是要最后完成德国的分裂，把整个西部德国变为美国在欧洲的主要的侵略基地。
    与此同时，美英帝国主义还在亚洲进行着其他一连串的阴谋活动。帝国主义的侵略防线在世界许多地方特别是在中国被炸破以后，它们正在东方其他地方如此惊慌地筑防。英国高级专员麦克唐纳，于一月二十一日开始和东南亚各国英属殖民地的总督在星加坡举行了三天会议，谈判所谓“它们之间更密切合作的方式和方法”（美联社）。美国策动组织的“东南亚集团”，在印度召开的“亚洲会议”上没有达到目的，现在又准备在菲律宾召开类似的会议，企图继续建立这个反革命集团。同时，美国陆军部长罗雅尔率领了一批侵略凶手，于一日飞抵日本，还要到朝鲜和太平洋各岛屿去“视察”，他们此行的主要任务之一，便是要和麦克阿瑟等“讨论正在转变中的中国局势”。把“日本建设成一个反共堡垒”（路透社）。
    美国加紧建立“北大西洋联盟”，及其侵略政策的一系列的新部署，又一次遭受以苏联为首的民主阵营的迎头痛击。苏联外交部于一月二十八日发表了关于“北大西洋联盟公约”的长篇声明，彻底揭露了这个联盟是美英统治集团作为达到侵略和发动新战争目的的一种手段，是它们直接破坏联合国组织的一个武器。声明引证了斯大林的结论，再次指出企图发动新战争的侵略者，是战胜不了主张和平的人民大众的力量的，是不可能将这种力量转向新战争去的。声明严正地宣布：苏联将“进行更加奋力与更加坚毅的斗争，以反对一切战争贩子，反对侵略与发动新战争的政策，争取全世界范围内的民主与持久和平”。
    为了这个目的，苏联部长会议主席斯大林，在一月卅日和二月二日，先后发表了两次重要文告，答复美国国际新闻社欧洲分社社长史密斯所提出的关于美苏关系问题的询问。斯大林在文告中声明，苏联政府愿意准备和美国政府发表联合声明，肯定宣示各该国政府无意于诉诸战争以互相反对，苏联政府愿意和美国政府合作，以采取旨在逐渐裁减军备的措施。关于柏林问题，斯大林指出：如果美英法三国遵守在召开外长会议整个地审议德国问题以前，延缓单独成立西德国家，同时取消其对东德的运输与贸易限制，那么，苏联政府亦愿意准备取消柏林和西德之间的运输限制。斯大林同时宣布不反对和杜鲁门举行关于和平公约的会议，并表示欢迎杜鲁门到苏联、波兰或捷克去商谈。斯大林这个反对新战争和坚决卫护民主和平的宏伟的声音。已经得到全世界一切爱好和平的人民的赞助，但是艾奇逊和杜鲁门却声明拒绝。
    为了同样的反侵略的目的，苏联政府于一月二十九日发表声明，要求意欲参加“北大西洋联盟”的挪威政府表明对该联盟的立场。在此以前，北欧人民已奋起高呼：“我们不要这个联盟！”挪威首都奥斯陆于一月二十八日举行了一个盛大集会，一致通过了抗议挪威企图参加北大西洋联盟的决议。
    争和平的运动在世界的其他部分也在发展着。法国共产党和总工会等十八个民主团体，呼吁法国人民在十三日举行“争取面包、和平、自由和独立”的全国大示威。一月三十日，纽约美苏友谊全国协会召唤美国人民，起来阻止这个酝酿战争的“北大西洋联盟”。一月二十五日在柏林开幕的德国统一社会党代表会议，在二十八日闭会以前，通过宣言，猛烈反对美英帝国主义正试图强加于德国人民的“占领法规”，号召德国人民为反对分裂和奴役德国的帝国主义政策而奋斗，为反对反动和战争阵营而斗争。代表会议对争取和平民主统一的德国的前途满怀信心，代表会议在庆祝中国人民解放事业伟大胜利的贺电中兴奋地指出：中国人民的胜利，“加强了德国人民在自己斗争中的力量”，“加强了德国人民对于民主和平力量最后战胜帝国主义战争贩子和反动派的信心”。
    亚洲三个国家的民族解放运动，仍在英勇坚持或胜利发展中。在越南，据越盟军总部宣布，越南人民将在今年取得独立战争的更大的胜利。在胡志明总统主持下的越南民主政府部长会议最近发表公报，号召越人动员一切力量和资源，向法帝国主义及其走狗在越南领土上的残存势力，发动全力进攻，以实现越南的真正独立。眼看着殖民世纪将要在越南结束，美国帝国主义又玩弄新花样，叫法国反动派把越南废皇保大抬出来重当傀儡皇帝，想利用这块旧招牌来哄骗越南人民。这个阴谋已受到胡志明的严厉警告：保大如果背叛其在逊位时所宣布的将不再叛卖人民的誓言，“将受到卖国贼应得的惩罚”。在印尼，自从荷兰帝国主义于去年十二月十九日发动野蛮的新进攻以来，到现在整整一个半月，虽然印尼卖国政府的大批首脑人员，无论被俘与否，已经大部投降，但是印尼人民的抗荷武装却在斗争中壮大起来了。法新社一月二十六日说：目前抗荷的游击队已有三十万人，并且还得到武装青年组织的支持。游击战的烽火到处燃烧着，荷兰侵略军已穷于应付。就连安理会印尼“调处”委员会在它一月二十四日的报告中，亦不得不承认印尼“局势极不稳定”，“荷军不敢深入，若干点现已发生严重纷扰”。荷兰反动当局亦不得不公开宣布将继续增兵印尼，继续对游击队作战三个月。在马来亚，人民游击队继续频繁地袭击公路、铁路和矿山。人民游击队的作战获得了广大人民的支持。英国纪事报记者伦伯尔最近在马来亚各地旅行后报导说：英国的处境是更加恶化了。他承认：“叛军（指人民游击队）作战效率甚高。”马来亚英军司令鲍奇尔焦灼苦恼地说：“只要人民一天还以粮食与情报帮助‘叛军’，只要一切社团的代表一天还不和政府合作，紧急状态就会和以前一样继续下去，随便多少军队也无济于事。”
    最近国际间其他较重要事件如下：
    （一）匈牙利成立了人民独立阵线，这是一个在工人阶级及其政党劳动人民党领导下的、以工农联盟为基础的一切民主力量的战斗联盟。这一阵线的主要任务在于在国内外新形势的基础上，把全国的民主力量团结起来，保卫和平与祖国的独立，保证建设一个名符其实的劳动人民的新国家。
    （二）日本共产党正在领导建立日本人民民主阵线。日共于一月二十八日已向社会党和工农党提出了这一建议，获得了广大劳动人民和社会党下层党员群众的支持，但以片山哲为首的反动的社会党领导机关，却决议拒绝日共的这一建议。
    （三）罗马尼亚和波兰于一月二十六日签定了两国友好合作互助条约。（新华社陕北七日电）
