　　Exchange Rate Between Border Region Currency and Western Farmer Currency is One to Two
　　To the Editor:
　　Our company was issued a sum of funds by superiors last October (including Border Region Currency). Later, when Yangqu County went to the Trade Bureau (in Hekou, Third District) to purchase goods, the bureau insisted on valuing each Border Region Currency at 1.6 Western Farmer Currency. This caused us a great loss. We have seen the North China Government's proclamation that the exchange rate between Border Region Currency and Western Farmer Currency is one to two. Therefore, we request a clear answer and hope you will inform the Yangqu Trade Bureau of this matter.
　　With best regards,
　　　　　　　　　Yangqu County Independent Battalion, 1st Company
　　　　　　　　　Company Commander Zhang Qirong, Political Instructor Wen Kailiang
　　To the responsible comrades of the Yangqu Independent 1st Company:
　　The following is a brief reply regarding the exchange rate between Border Region Currency and Western Farmer Currency:
　　The North China People's Government announced on October 20th of last year that the exchange rate between Border Region Currency and Western Farmer Currency is one to two, meaning one Border Region Currency is equal to two Western Farmer Currency. This exchange rate is fixed and permanent. No one is allowed to change it arbitrarily. It is incorrect for the Yangqu Trade Bureau to value one Border Region Currency at 1.6 Western Farmer Currency. We hope you will negotiate with them based on the proclamation to resolve this matter.

　　边币与西农币比值是一比二编辑同志：
    我连去年十月份由上级发给一部经费（内有边币），后阳曲县到贸易局（在三区河口）购物时，该局硬把每元边币折西农币一元六角。这一来我们吃亏很大的，我们曾看到华北政府的布告边币与西农币一比二，故请给予我们明确答复，并希转告阳曲贸易局是荷。    此致敬礼　　
　　　　　　　　　阳曲县独立营一连　连长张启荣、政指温开亮阳曲独立一连负责同志：
    兹将边币和西农比价问题简复如下：
    华北人民政府于去年十月二十日布告边币和西农币的比价为一比二，即边币一元等于西农二元，这个比价是固定永久不变的。任何人都不得随意更动。阳曲贸易局如按边币一元顶西农币一元六角是不对的。希根据布告和他们商议解决。
