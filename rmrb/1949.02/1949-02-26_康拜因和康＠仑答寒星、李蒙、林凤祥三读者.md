　　Combine and Consortium Answer Three Readers: Han Xing, Li Meng, Lin Fengxiang
    The result of capitalist free competition is that large-scale production and large capital swallow up small-scale production and small capital; or promote small-scale production and small capital to merge into larger operations in order to maintain their existence. However, competition does not stop there. Giants among large-scale production and large capital also swallow each other, and finally only a few of the largest giants remain, monopolizing production and sales. This is the monopoly capital of the imperialist era. Monopoly capital began between the 19th and 20th centuries, first occurring in the leading heavy industry sectors, and now it has gradually become popular in all industrial sectors of imperialist countries. Monopoly is a product based on free competition; it cannot eliminate competition. On the contrary, it turns the competition between scattered enterprises into a more intense struggle between a few monopoly groups, and its cruelty and ability to destroy production are far more severe than free competition.
    The organizational forms of monopoly capital have now undergone five stages. The initial monopoly organizations: cartels, syndicates, and trusts have already been introduced in the reading dictionary. Now, only the later two monopoly organizations, combine and consortium, are introduced as follows:
    (1) Combine (also translated as "Kangbai'en"): is an economic unit formed by the combination of two or more enterprises that are related in production. For example, the United States Steel Corporation, because steelmaking cannot be separated from the use of coal, electricity, machinery, and hardware parts, and even more from mines, it is combined with enterprises such as coal mining, power generation, and machinery manufacturing, or it uses its own capital to start these enterprises. This forms a combined production. The emergence of combine represents the further concentration and socialization of capitalist production; at the same time, it further improves labor productivity, making the exploitation suffered by workers even more serious.
    (2) Consortium (also translated as "Kang'en"): is what we often call chaebols or financial groups, such as Morgan and Rockefeller in the United States, and Mitsui and Mitsubishi in Japan. Consortium is a higher organizational form of monopoly capital. It combines various different enterprises, such as banks, mines, transportation, factories, stores, and even hotels and theaters, forming a monopoly group of extremely large scope.
    Whether it is combine, consortium, or other monopoly organizations, it only has one function, which is to intensify the struggle between monopoly capital groups. The occurrence and development of all monopoly organizations indicate that the anarchy and lack of planning in the entire production of capitalist society, and the organized contradictions of individual monopoly groups and individual enterprises are becoming more profound, and the dying struggle of capitalist society.

　　康拜因和康＠仑答寒星、李蒙、林凤祥三读者
    资本主义自由竞争的结果，使大生产、大资本并吞了小生产、小资本；或者促使小生产、小资本为了保持自己的存在而合并为较大的经营。但是，竞争并不就此停止，大生产，大资本间的巨头，又互相并吞，最后只剩下少数最大的巨头，垄断着生产和销售，这就是帝国主义时代的垄断资本。垄断资本开始于十九与二十世纪之间，首先发生在占有领导地位的重工业部门，现在已经渐渐普及于帝国主义国家的所有工业部门。垄断是自由竞争基础上的产物，它不能消除竞争；相反的，它把分散的各个企业间的竞争变成了少数垄断集团之间更剧烈的斗争，其残酷与破坏生产的能力都远较自由竞争厉害。
    垄断资本的组织形式，现在已发生过五种，初期的垄断组织：卡特尔、新迪加、托拉斯都已经在读报辞典中介绍过了，现在只把较后期的两种垄断组织，康拜因与康＠仑介绍如下：
    （一）康拜因（也有译成康拜恩的）：是两个以上的生产上有联系的企业结合起来的经济单位。譬如美国钢公司，因为炼钢离不开用煤、用电、用机器和五金零件，更离不开矿，因此它就和采煤、发电、制造机器，开矿等企业联合起来，或者，它自己拿出资本去开办这些企业。这样就形成了康拜因的生产。康拜因的出现，表现着资本主义生产的更形集中、更形社会化；同时，也更进一步提高了劳动生产率，使工人所受的剥削更加严重。
    （二）康＠仑（也有译成康＠恩的）：也就是我们常说的财阀或财团，如美国的摩根、洛克非勒和日本的三井、三菱等都是。康＠仑是垄断资本更高的组织形式，它把各种不同的企业：如银行、矿山、交通、工厂、商店，甚至旅馆、剧院都联合在一起，形成了极大范围的垄断集团。
    无论是康拜因、康＠仑，或其他的垄断组织，它只有一种作用，就是使垄断资本集团之间的斗争更加剧烈。一切垄断组织的发生与发展，都表示着资本主义社会整个生产的无政府、无计划，与个别垄断集团、个别企业的有组织的矛盾的更加深刻，与资本主义社会的垂死挣扎。
