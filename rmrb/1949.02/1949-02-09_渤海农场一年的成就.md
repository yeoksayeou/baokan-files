    Achievements of Bohai Farm in One Year

　　Bohai Farm has a total of 412 mu of land, with simple water conservancy facilities. Apart from the area occupied by houses, farmyards, pigsties, etc., the remaining 90-plus mu of land are divided into three areas: crop experiment area (small-plot experiments and large-area experiments), crop breeding area, and horticulture experiment area. In addition, there is a nursery with 24 mu of land, propagating various tree seedlings; and a livestock breeding station with breeding cattle, donkeys, pigs, sheep, etc. There are more than 60 staff, students, and workers in the entire farm. In 1948, significant achievements were made in both experimental and promotional work.

　　(A) Experimenting with Improved Varieties

    The experimental work in the past year included: variety comparison experiments, cultivation experiments, pest control experiments, fertilization experiments, and crop experiments for disaster relief in waterlogged areas. The best results were obtained with the Si-character cotton, Jin Huanghou (Golden Queen) corn, and bald wheat. These are considered to be excellent varieties that should be widely promoted in the future. 1. The cotton variety experiment included five varieties: Si-character cotton, Dabai Zi (Large White Seed), Dazi Mian (Large Purple Cotton), Xiaozi Mian (Small Purple Cotton), and Tuolis (Dollis). The results showed that the Si-character cotton was the best, yielding 260 jin per mu; Dabai Zi was the second best, yielding 254 jin per mu; and Tuolis was the worst, yielding 200 jin per mu. Each mu of Si-character cotton yielded 60 jin more than a mu of Tuolis cotton. Si-character cotton is generally easier to grow. Although it matures about ten days later than Tuolis cotton, it has been proven that Si-character cotton can fully mature and open all its bolls. The fertilizer used was only one cart of manure and 50 jin of soybean cake per mu, and it was hoed five times. 2. Jin Huanghou corn was preliminarily tested the year before last, yielding 400 jin per mu. It was planned to be promoted last spring. However, farmers had some concerns: they believed that this corn matured too late; planting it after harvesting wheat would prevent it from maturing, delaying the planting of wheat. Some also said that Jin Huanghou required a lot of fertilizer and was too expensive to grow. Based on these concerns, the experiment was repeated last spring. It was sown on June 25th (after the summer solstice) after harvesting wheat. At the same time, small yellow corn was planted for comparison. Hoeing and fertilization were the same for both: hoed four times, and 50 jin of soybean cake and 30 jin of fertilizer powder were applied per mu. The results showed that small yellow corn matured by September 20th; Jin Huanghou matured on October 4th (before the Cold Dew). The difference in maturity period was only half a month. Wheat was planted after harvesting Jin Huanghou, and the seedlings emerged very well. The timing was not too late. Each mu of Jin Huanghou corn yielded an average of 550 jin, while small yellow corn yielded an average of 270 jin per mu. Jin Huanghou yielded more than twice as much per mu. The amount of fertilizer used was not much. In the future, four pieces of soybean cake per municipal mu will be sufficient. 3. The results of the wheat variety experiment showed that bald wheat was the best. The yield per mu was 244 jin, which was 20-30 jin more than ordinary wheat, and it matured earlier. In the wheat variety experiment, a wheat urine irrigation experiment was also conducted. A fraction of wheat was irrigated with urine, and it grew very well, with dark green leaves and large ears. Applying urine fertilizer is very effective in areas where the soil is not too saline. Furthermore, the variety experiments proved that Daluochui sorghum, white millet, white rice millet, indigo, and hemp are all very good varieties and should be promoted. The disaster relief crop experiments in waterlogged areas included rice barley, spring wheat, and naked oats. Rice barley is a type of barley without husks. Last year, the farm tried to plant one mu before the Spring Equinox, applying one cart of manure and hoeing once. It matured by June 8th. The time from sowing to maturity was less than three months, and the yield was 230 jin per mu. Spring wheat also matures very quickly and is a good crop for relieving spring hunger. It can be sown before the Spring Equinox and harvested by the Summer Solstice. Naked oats are planted after the ninth day counting from the winter solstice by soaking any kind of wheat in cold water every nine days, placing them in a warm place and sowing the next year. It matures by the Summer Solstice, which is an effective remedy in waterlogged areas where sowing is not possible in winter.

　　(B) Promotion Work

    The promotion work started and developed from close contact between the farm and the farmers. In the past, farmers were not familiar with the farm, and they did not know what was being tested. Therefore, last spring, the farm planned to participate in the expanded village cadre meetings in two districts to promote tree seedlings, Si-character cotton, indigo, etc., explaining that the farm was serving the farmers. Based on the season and the difficulties faced by the farmers, it was suggested: if you want to plant trees, you can exchange for tree seedlings at the farm; if you want to plant indigo, you can exchange for seeds at the farm. From then on, many farmers came to the farm to exchange for tree seedlings and seeds. In early April, during the preparation period for cotton planting, village cadre meetings were held in 22 villages to discuss how to plant Si-character cotton and indigo, and to specifically discuss the method of exchanging seeds. Furthermore, base villages for promotion were established to listen to the opinions of the masses and learn from their experiences. Initially, four base villages were established around the farm, and demonstration farmers were cultivated, which played a significant role in promotion. Later, in order to ensure that the indigo seeds and Si-character cotton seeds exchanged by the farmers were successfully planted, farm cadres went to the villages to provide specific guidance, and by helping the masses with summer harvesting, discussing and summarizing the summer harvest, and educating the masses to use improved varieties and apply more fertilizer. During the discussions, when the wheat planted by the farmers was compared with the wheat planted by the farm, the farmers praised the farm's wheat. The wheat planted by the farmers yielded a maximum of 5.5 dou per mu, while the average yield was 4-4.5 dou, but the farm's wheat yielded more than 7 dou per mu. The farmers identified the reason as the poor quality of the seeds. Before and after the summer hoeing, the various crops in the farm were growing vigorously. At this time, farmers were welcomed to visit and provide guidance in order to exchange experiences and further promote the work. A total of 18 villages, with more than 100 people, mainly village cadres and experienced old farmers, came to visit in organized groups. The main crops they visited were Si-character cotton, Jin Huanghou corn, tobacco, indigo, millet, and sorghum. They received unanimous praise from the masses, especially the Jin Huanghou corn, which was tall and large, and everyone requested to conduct thorough experiments and plant more of it next year. Before and after the autumn planting, the farm participated in the guidance work for the autumn harvest and autumn planting in the Longchi District, developed demonstration farmers, and leveraged the role of demonstration farmers. After the autumn planting, meetings of production activists and agricultural exhibitions were held one after another to exchange production experiences.

　　(C) Achievements and Experiences

    Over the past year, the above activities have strengthened the connection between the farm and the farmers, and expanded the scope of promotion work. As a result, the promotion work has achieved the following results: (1) Promoting tree planting: The farm's nursery originally had 8,200 cypress, elm, and black locust seedlings. By exchanging grain seeds, tree seeds, and vegetable seeds for tree seedlings, 2,391 cypress seedlings, 819 elm seedlings, and 1,169 black locust seedlings were exchanged to the masses. Highway afforestation: 700 trees were planted on the Hui (min)-Yang (xin) highway, and 1,300 damaged tree seedlings were transplanted. In addition, 1,317 tree seedlings were given to poor farmers. (2) Si-character cotton: More than 25,700 jin of seeds were promoted, covering 10 districts in 8 counties, including Boxing, Putai, Yangxin, and Huimin, with an estimated increase of more than 3,200 mu of Si-character cotton. The seedling emergence and harvest were very good. (3) Indigo: A total of 25 villages were covered, with approximately 30 mu of indigo planted. During indigo extraction, the farm dispatched four dedicated personnel to the villages to guide the masses in indigo extraction. According to the statistics of 3.6 mu of indigo, a total of 133 jin of indigo were extracted, partially solving the masses' dye shortage. Furthermore, 68 demonstration farmers were cultivated in 10 villages over the past year. These demonstration farmers are all farmers with high production enthusiasm and rich production experience, which has greatly promoted production. In this year's autumn planting, most or all of the demonstration households in each village took the lead in seed soaking, influencing other farmers to soak seeds, and sowing a total of 288 mu of demonstration wheat. Each mu of wheat was fertilized with 40-50 jin of soybean cake, which is 10-20 jin more fertilizer than in the past.

    The experiences and lessons learned from the promotion work over the past year: First, promotion work should be combined with experimental work. Anything that has not been tested or has not been effective after testing should not be promoted. If you want to promote something, it must be successfully tested first. Only in this way can farmers be convinced and can it be easily promoted. For example, the successful experiments with Si-character cotton and indigo led to their promotion being embraced by the farmers. Although Jin Huanghou corn is also a good variety, it has not undergone various experiments, such as how to plant it, what soil is suitable, how early or late it matures, etc., and there is no experience in these aspects. Therefore, it is not possible to convince the farmers, and it could not be promoted last year. Varieties from outside the district and varieties adjusted from the masses must also be tested and identified. Second, the things being promoted must meet the needs of the masses. At the same time, the promotion of a good variety is best done by using actual objects as specimens, and using practical examples to educate the masses, making it easier for them to accept. Only then can a good variety be quickly promoted.

　　渤海农场一年的成就
    渤海农场共有土地四百十二亩，内有简单的水利设备。除去房屋、场园、猪栏等所占的面积外，其余九十多亩地分为作物试验区（小区试验和大区试验）、作物繁殖区、园艺试验区等三个区域。另外，附设苗圃一处，有地二十四亩，繁殖着各种树苗；种畜站一处，内有种牛、种驴、种猪、种羊等。全场职员、学员、工人共六十余人。一九四八年的一年中，不论在试验工作和推广工作中都获得不小成绩。
　　（甲）试验优良品种
    一年来试验工作：有各种品种的比较试验，栽培试验，杀虫试验，施肥试验，水涝区救灾作物试验，多种品种的比较试验。试验的结果以棉花中的斯字棉，棒子中的金皇后，小麦中的秃头麦为最好。认为这是今后应普遍推广的优良品种。一、棉花品种试验的有斯字棉、大白籽、大紫棉、小紫棉、脱利斯五种。结果以斯字棉为最好，每亩产二百六十斤；大白籽次之，每亩产二百五十四斤；脱利斯最差，每亩产二百斤。每亩斯字棉比一亩脱利斯棉多产六十斤。而斯字棉一般地比较好种，虽比脱利斯棉晚熟十几天，但已证明斯字棉能够完全成熟，开完桃子。所用肥料，每亩只一车圈粪，五十斤豆饼。锄五遍。二、金皇后玉米前年初步试验过，每亩产四百斤。去春准备推广。但农民有所顾虑：认为这种玉米熟得太晚，割麦后种上就熟不了，耽误种麦子；也有的说金皇后吃粪水大，种不起。根据这些情况，去春又重作了试验，在割麦后六月二十五日（夏至后）播种，并同时种上小黄玉米以作比较，修锄、施肥两种都一样，锄四遍，每亩施肥五十斤豆饼，三十斤肥田粉。结果小黄玉米至九月二十日成熟；金皇后十月四日成熟（寒露以前）。成熟期相差只有半月，收金皇后后又种了小麦，出苗很好，时期上并不算晚。每亩金皇后玉米平均收五百五十斤，小黄玉米每亩平均收二百七十斤，金皇后每亩增产一倍还多。用肥料并不多，今后一般每市亩上四片豆饼即可。三、小麦品种试验的结果，以秃头麦子为最好。每亩产量为二百四十四斤，比一般麦子多二、三十斤，且成熟较早。在小麦品种的试验中，同时进行了小麦浇尿试验，用尿浇了一分麦子，结果长得很好，叶子乌黑穗子大，在咸性不太大的地方施尿肥收效很大。其次，在品种的试验中证明：打锣锤高粱、白谷、白米谷子、蓝、麻等都是很好的品种，应加以推广。水涝地区救灾作物试验，有米大麦、春麦、莜麦三种。米大麦是一种不带皮的大麦，去年农场于春分节前试种一亩，上粪一车，锄一遍，至六月八日即成熟。播种到成熟期不到三个月，每亩收二百三十斤。春麦也是很快能成熟的，是救春荒的好庄稼。春分前种，夏至即可收割。莜麦，是在交九以后把小麦的任何一种每隔九天用冷水捞一次，放在不冷不热的地方，明年下种，夏至即熟，是在水涝地区冬季不能下种的有效补救办法。
　　（乙）推广工作
    推广工作，是从密切农场与农民的联系开始和发展的。过去农民对农场是不熟悉的，所试验的东西农民也不知道。因此，去春农场为推广树苗、斯字棉、蓝靛等便有计划地参加了两个区的扩大村干会，说明农场是为农民服务的。并根据季节和农民的困难提出：要种树可到农场换树苗；要种蓝可到农场换种子。从此，便有很多农民到农场换树苗、换种子。四月初正是植棉的准备时期，便又召开了二十二个村的村干会，座谈了如何种斯字棉及种蓝等办法，并具体讨论了换种子的办法。并进一步建立了推广的基点村，听取群众意见，吸取群众经验。开始在农场周围建立了四个基点村，培养了示范农户，对推广起很大作用。以后，为把农民换去的蓝种、斯字棉种种活，农场干部又分头下去进行具体指导，并通过帮助群众夏收，座谈总结夏收，教育群众使用优良品种，多施肥。大家座谈时，拿农民种的麦子与农场种的相比，农民都称赞农场的麦子好。农民所种麦子每亩最多产五斗半，一般的产四斗至四斗半，但农场的每亩产七斗多。农民找出了它的原因是种子不好。夏锄前后，农场里各种作物正长得蓬蓬勃勃。此时，便欢迎农民来场参观指导，借以交流经验，进一步开展推广工作。前后有组织的来场参观的有十八个村，百余人，大部是村干部和有经验的老农。所参观的主要是斯字棉、金皇后、烟、蓝、谷子、高粱等。得到群众的一致赞扬，特别是金皇后棒子又高又大，都要求好好试验明年多种。在秋种前后，农场参加了龙池区秋收、秋种的指导工作，发展了示范农户，发挥了示范农户的作用。秋种后又先后召开了生产积极分子会及农业展览会，交流生产经验。
　　（丙）成绩和经验
    一年中通过以上各种活动密切了农场与农民的联系，扩大了推广工作的范围。因而推广工作获得了如下的成绩：（一）推广植树：农场苗圃原有柏树、榆树、洋槐树苗八千二百棵，以粮种、树种、菜种换树苗的办法，换给群众柏树二千三百九十一棵；榆树八百十九棵，洋槐一千一百六十九棵。公路造林：在惠（民）阳（信）公路栽树七百棵，移植残坏树苗千三百棵。另外送给贫困农民树苗一千三百一十七棵。（二）斯字棉推广种子两万五千七百余斤，共推广博兴、蒲台、阳信、惠民等八个县十个区，约计增种斯字棉三千二百余亩。出苗、收成都很好。（三）蓝：共推广二十五个村，约计种蓝三十亩。打靛时农场派四个专人分头到村指导群众打靛。据三亩六分蓝的统计：打靛共百三十三斤。部分地解决了群众的颜料困难。其次，一年中在十个村培养了六十八个示范农户。这些示范农户都是生产热情高、生产有经验的农民，对生产有极大推动作用。各村示范户在今年秋种中，大部或全部带头浸种，影响其他农民浸种，共播种示范麦子二百八十八亩。每亩麦子施肥四十斤至五十斤豆饼，比过去多施肥一、二十斤。
    一年推广工作所获得的经验教训：首先是推广工作要与试验工作相结合，没有经过试验和试验后没有成效的便不推广，要想推广一种东西，必须经过试验成功。只有这样才能使农民信服，才容易推广。如斯字棉和蓝靛试验成功，推广后便得到农民的拥护。金皇后棒子虽也是好品种，但因未作过各种试验，如如何种法，宜什么土壤，成熟早晚等，都无经验，因此便不能说服农民，去年也就未能推广。对外区来的品种和从群众中调剂来的品种，也必须经过试验鉴别。其次，推广的东西必须合乎群众的需要，同时一种好的品种的推广，最好用实物作成标本，对群众以实际例子进行宣传教育，群众易于接受，一种好的品种，才可得到迅速的推广。
