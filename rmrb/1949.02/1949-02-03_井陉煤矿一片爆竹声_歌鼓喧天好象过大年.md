　　Jingxing Coal Mine a Blast of Firecrackers
　　Singing and Drumming Like Celebrating the New Year
　　[Reported by this newspaper] After the liberation of Tianjin and Peiping, the workers of the Jingxing Coal Mine are singing praises for the invincible People's Liberation Army and launching a慰劳 (comfort/support) movement. When the news of the complete liberation of Peiping arrived, it immediately aroused extraordinary joy among the people. Ten minutes later, the good news spread throughout the North and South New Mines, and all the blackboard newspapers simultaneously displayed these startling large characters. At 5 o'clock that day, the Yangko team of the hospital staff, with responsible cadres personally participating, stirred all the workers' families and merchants in the mine market streets with their singing and drumming. Until the mine was full of lights and the clock struck seven, they were still parading everywhere, accompanied by the sound of firecrackers all over the ground, as if the Spring Festival had arrived early. In the South Mine (Fengshan Mine) of Jingxing, the workers of the coal and coke plant first proposed, "We must use action to celebrate." More than a hundred comrades immediately added an hour of voluntary work that day as a reward to the soldiers at the front. When the news reached the Second Electromechanical Section, 300 workers also decided to immediately dedicate one hour of voluntary work to increase the production of parts. The workers of the Engineering Section were late to get off work, and thousands of people shouted in the flashing lights: This one said I will also donate work, that one said I will also do an extra day, and many people declared that after Nanjing is captured, they will work an extra week.

　　井陉煤矿一片爆竹声
  　歌鼓喧天好象过大年
    【本报讯】平津解放以后，井陉煤矿职工正为无敌的人民解放军而歌颂与开展慰劳运动。当北平完全解放的消息传来，立即引起人们非凡的欢快。十分钟后，捷报传遍南北新井各矿，所有的黑板报同时换上这十几个惊人的大字，当日五点钟，医院职工的秧歌队，在负责干部亲自参加下，歌声鼓声惊动了所有矿市街的职工家属与商民。直至满矿灯火，钟响七时，犹在各处游行，夹以遍地爆竹连声，恰似春节提早来到。在井陉的南矿（凤山矿），首先是煤焦厂的职工，自动提议“我们要用行动来庆祝”，一百多位同志立即于当天加义务工一小时，作为对前方将士的报答。消息传到第二机电科，三百职工同样决定立即献义务工一点钟，以增加机件的生产。井工科的工友下班迟了，千百的人群在灯光闪烁下嚷成一片：这个说我也献工，那个说我也多作一天，很多人并声明打下南京要加工一星期。
