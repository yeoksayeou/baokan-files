Xinhua News Agency, Tianjin, 9th. The Tianjin Military Control Commission and the People's Government, in order to provide urgent relief to nearly 300,000 disaster victims and poor people who have suffered from the reactionary rule of the Kuomintang and the persecution of the Kuomintang bandit army, distributed 3.9 million catties of emergency relief grain before the Spring Festival, which was completed in seven days. A total of 69,852 households, comprising 299,208 people, benefited from this relief. Calculated at one catty of millet per person per day, each person received an average of about half a month's worth of relief grain. There were two characteristics of the working methods in this grain distribution. First, in the course of the work, attention was paid to mobilizing the active elements among the disaster victims and poor people to participate, so that the relief grain could be distributed quickly and reasonably. When the working groups in various districts began to investigate and review the households eligible for relief grain, they generally used the old Baojia chiefs to cooperate. However, because the old Baojia chiefs were accustomed to the old methods, such as saying to the masses, "Those who receive it without being entitled to it will be punished," this affected some disaster victims and poor people who were afraid to register and therefore did not receive relief. Some working groups adopted the method of cadres visiting households one by one, but the progress was slow and it could not be guaranteed that the investigation was accurate. Later, the disaster victims and poor people who should receive relief were organized into groups, and group leaders were democratically elected to assist government cadres in conducting reviews, so that a few people who wanted to cheat were exposed by the masses. When distributing the second batch of relief grain, the Second District corrected the method of relying on the old Baojia personnel for registration and distribution, and instead organized 25 emergency relief committees based on the Bao, which were organized by representatives democratically elected by the disaster victims and poor people of each street and district cadres under the unified leadership of the district government to carry out registration, investigation, evaluation, distribution and other work. This method was warmly supported by the disaster victims and poor people, and many disaster victims and poor people who were enthusiastic about serving the masses were elected as members, and quickly completed the relief work. Second, in the distribution of relief grain, many areas implemented the spirit of achieving relief through production, and paid attention to organizing disaster victims and poor people to develop production. The Municipal Bureau of Industry and Commerce sent working groups to the Fifth, Sixth, Eighth, Ninth, and Eleventh Districts to organize transportation teams of disaster victims and poor people to transport soda ash, kerosene, matches, and foreign cloth to outside the city, and transport vegetables, meat, and grain from outside the city. Four districts have organized 152 transportation teams, with 123 teams in the Fifth District alone, totaling more than 400 people. They use bicycles for transportation, and each person earns enough to support three people each day. The disaster victims and poor people believe that the Military Control Commission and the People's Government's distribution of relief grain and organization of their production is like obtaining sweet rain in a great drought. Many people said: If the government had not distributed this batch of relief grain, I really don't know how many people would have starved to death! Luo Jishun, a worker in the Fifth District, said: "Now that we have received relief grain, we must work hard in production in the future. It is not a permanent solution to rely solely on national relief."

  　发粮赈济灾民贫民
  　同时组织从事生产
    【新华社天津九日电】天津市军事管制委员会暨人民市政府为急救近三十万遭国民党反动统治和国民党匪军迫害的灾民、贫民，于春节前发放急赈粮三百九十万斤，七天即发放完毕。获得此项救济之灾民、贫民，计达六万九千八百五十二户，二十九万九千二百零八人。按每人每日一斤小米计，每人所得平均约有半个月的赈济粮。此次赈济粮的发放，在工作方式上有两个特点。第一，在工作进行中，注意了发动灾民、贫民中的积极分子参加，使赈粮得以迅速合理地发放。各区工作组开始调查和审查赈粮户时，一般都利用旧保甲长配合进行，但因旧保甲长习惯于旧的方法，如对群众说，“不该领的领了要受处罚”等，以致影响部分灾民、贫民不敢登记，因而未得到赈济。有的工作组则采取了干部挨户访问的方法，但进度很慢，也不能保证调查得确实。后来把应受赈济的灾民、贫民组成小组，民主选出组长，协助政府干部进行审查，使少数想搞鬼的分子都受到群众的检举。二区在发放第二批赈粮时，改正了依靠旧保甲人员登记发放的办法，而以保为单位，组织了二十五个急赈委员会，由各街灾民贫民民主推选的代表和区干部组织在区政府统一领导下，进行登记、调查、评议、发放等工作。这一办法，获得灾民贫民的热烈拥护，许多热心为群众服务的灾民、贫民被选为委员，很快地完成了赈济工作。第二，在发放赈粮中，很多地区贯彻了从生产中达到救济的精神，注意了组织灾民贫民发展生产。市政府工商局曾派工作组赴五、六、八、九、十一等区，组织灾民贫民运输小组，向市外运碱面、煤油、火柴、洋布，从市外运回蔬菜、肉、粮食等。四个区已组织了一百五十二个运输小组，仅五区即组织了一百二十三个组，共四百多人，他们用自行车驮运，每人每天所赚足够三人生活。灾民贫民对军管会和人民政府发放赈济粮并组织他们生产，都认为是在大旱中获得了甘霖。许多人都说：政府若不发这批赈浏粮，真不知要饿死多少人呢！五区工人罗吉顺说：“咱们得到救济粮，以后就得好好生产，净靠国家救济不是个常事儿。”
