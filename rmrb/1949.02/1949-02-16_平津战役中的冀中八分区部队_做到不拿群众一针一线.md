The Jizhong Eighth Military Subdistrict Troops in the Pingjin Campaign
	Not Taking a Single Needle or Thread from the Masses

	[Jizhong Electric] The Jizhong Eighth Military Subdistrict troops achieved good results in the Pingjin Campaign by correctly implementing and executing policies and discipline while cooperating with the regular army to liberate the area. The Independent Second Battalion's First and Second Companies, the Coastal Defense Detachment's First and Second Companies, and the Twenty-first Regiment's Fifth Company were exemplary in implementing policies and discipline, earning praise from the masses and the military control commission. The Coastal Defense Detachment, to protect the Daliangzi Factory, strictly guarded the icy and snowy positions by the sea, fighting the enemy across the river under intense artillery fire, ensuring that materials and workers suffered no losses. In taking over Gegu, Xiaozhan, Yangliuqing in Tianjin South, and the northern section of the Jinpu Railway, they quickly stabilized social order, ensuring that warehouses, factories, schools, and transportation were kept intact. Except for a few individual violations of discipline, over 95% of the troops strictly followed the Three Main Rules of Discipline and the Eight Points for Attention. When the Independent Second Battalion was guarding warehouses in Yangliuqing, an order was issued that no one was allowed to enter the city through the East Gate; when a platoon leader from the Twenty-first Regiment tried to pass through the East Gate, the guards resolutely refused him. During an urgent mission, the Second Battalion of the Twenty-first Regiment traversed more than thirty li of muddy roads, their shoes and socks soaked, but no one asked to burn the masses' firewood after arriving at their destination. Soldiers were very thirsty during the march, and there were many pears discarded by the enemy along the way, but they collected them and handed them over to the public, without anyone eating a single one. The Fourth Company of the Independent Second Battalion did not use a single needle or thread from the masses in Yangliuqing for more than ten days. When a soldier's pants were torn, Zhang Hong tore the thread from his notebook for everyone to use. The Coastal Defense Detachment, in the coastal area, had no water to drink because the enemy had sealed the wells, so they fought while carrying water from the seaside, seven or eight li away, to drink and to give to the masses. The Independent First Battalion arrived at Lushuigou at night and refused the village cadres' offer to find civilian housing and schools for them to live in, instead staying in dilapidated temples. Zhang Hong, a soldier of the Twenty-first Regiment, found a gold ring on the streets of Yangliuqing and immediately handed it over to the company headquarters, posting a notice on the street to find the owner, moving the person who lost the item to say, "I have lived to such an old age and have never seen such a good army." When a sergeant from the Fourth Company of the Independent Second Battalion bought meat, the merchant miscalculated the bill, undercharging him four thousand yuan; after discovering the error, he immediately ran back and paid the merchant the full amount. Before the official exchange rate was announced, over 95% of the officers and soldiers of the Coastal Defense Detachment's Independent Second Battalion did not buy a single item. During the war, the Independent Third Battalion captured an entire company's worth of guns and ammunition from the enemy, keeping not a single gun or bullet. After inspecting the captured enemy soldiers, pens, watches, and leather shoes were immediately returned to them in person, and they were educated. The unit achieved the above results mainly due to: (1) Good prior preparation. In the past, due to high levels of decentralization, education and management were not tightly controlled, and guerrilla habits were very serious. Before this mission, an enlarged party committee meeting was held for battalion secretaries and above in the entire military subdistrict, past implementation of various systems was strictly reviewed, experiences and lessons were identified, and learning materials were assigned to cadres and soldiers at all levels, such as battalions and companies. The entire unit carried out policy and discipline studies, reviewed and criticized various erroneous ideas and petty calculations, and finally implemented testing, greatly improving the awareness and understanding of cadres and soldiers at all levels. Each unit also formulated its own rules for observing discipline and engaged in mutual challenges. Some soldiers composed the rules they made into ballads and pasted them on their rifles. Tian Jianxuan of the First Company composed a song: "The big rifle, made in Japan, makes the enemy scream; learn policies, learn discipline, we must do it when we enter the city. We do not commit selfishness and benefit, we eliminate corrupt thoughts; to the masses, we must propagate, not taking a single needle or thread from the masses." (2) Education was conducted at all times and in all places. For example, when the Independent First and Second Battalions rested during marches, they took advantage of the four or five minutes to conduct education, so that everyone would always pay attention. (3) Education was combined with inspection. Daily inspections were conducted, and the results of the inspections and actual materials were used as living teaching materials. Criticism and self-criticism were conducted after education.

　　平津战役中的冀中八分区部队
  　做到不拿群众一针一线
    【冀中电】冀中第八军分区部队在配合正规军解放平津战役中，正确贯彻与执行政策纪律，收到良好成绩。该队中的独二营一、二连与海防支队的一、二连，及二十一团的五连，是执行政策与纪律的模范，受到群众及军管会的赞扬。海防支队为保护大良子工厂，严守在海边的冰雪阵地，与敌隔河在剧烈的炮火下斗争，使物资与工人未受到一点损失。在接收津南葛沽、小站、杨柳青与津浦路北段各车站中，都很快的安定了社会秩序，使各城镇、车站的仓库、工厂、学校及交通工具均保持完好无损。该部除个别少数违犯纪律外，百分之九十五以上均严格执行了三大纪律八项注意。独二营在杨柳青看守仓库时，上级命令东门不准任何人入城，二十一团某排长要通过东门，守岗者即坚决拒绝了他。二十一团二营在紧急的任务中，踏了三十多里的泥路，鞋袜湿透了，但到达目的地后，没一人烤群众一把柴。行军中战士们走的很渴，路上有很多敌人扔弃的梨，他们拾回来也交了公，没人吃一个。独二营四连在杨柳青十几天内，没用群众一针一线。战士的裤子破了，张洪把自己书本子上的线拆下来叫大家用。海防支队在海边一带阵地中，因敌把井封锁了，没水吃，他们即一面战斗，一面到七、八里路的海边挑水来吃，并给群众吃。独一营夜间赶到卤水沽，村干部要给他们找民房和学校住，他们拒绝了，住在破庙里。廿一团战士张红有在杨柳青街上拾到一个金戒指，马上送交连部，并在街上贴条招领，感动得失物人说：“我活了这样大年纪，没见过这样好的军队”。独二营四连上士买肉时，商人错算了帐，少要了他四万元，他发觉后，随即跑回去如数付给商人。海防支队独二营的干部、战士，在未公布货币比值前，百分之九十五以上的未买一文钱的东西。独三营在战争中缴获敌人一个整连的枪弹，一枪一弹末留。检查出俘虏的钢笔、手表、皮鞋，都马上当面退还了俘虏，并向他们进行了教育。该部获得如上成绩，主要由于：（一）事先准备工作好。该部过去由于高度分散，教育管理抓的不紧，游击习气曾很严重。这次在执行任务前，即召开了全军分区营书记以上的党委扩大会，严格检查了过去的各种制度执行情况，找出经验教训，并分别在营、连等各级干部与战士中布置了学习材料，全队展开政策与纪律学习，检查批判了各种错误思想与小打算，最后并实行测验，大大提高了各级干部及战士的觉悟与认识。各队并自己订立遵守纪律规则，相互展开挑战。有的战士把订的规则编成歌谣，贴在枪杆上。一连田兼轩编的歌是：“大盖枪，日本造，打的敌人呱呱叫；学政策，学纪律，进城一定要做到。自私自利俺不犯，贪污思想俺取消；对群众，要宣传，不拿群众一针线。”（二）随时随地进行了教育。如独一、独二营在行军中休息时，四、五分钟的时间，也要抓紧进行教育，使大家经常注意。（三）教育与检查结合。日日检查，将检查的结果和实际的材料，作为活的教材。教育后进行批评检讨。
