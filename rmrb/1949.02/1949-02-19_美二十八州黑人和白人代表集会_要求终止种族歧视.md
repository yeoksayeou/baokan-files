Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, February 17th: TASS Washington dispatch: The American "National Legislative Conference and Assembly Demanding an End to Racial Discrimination" concluded on February 12th. Attending this conference were over 1,200 black and white representatives from twenty-eight states. This meeting was initiated by a group of prominent figures headed by black leader Wilson, and gained the sponsorship and active support of many labor unions, religious organizations, the Progressive Party, the Civil Rights Congress, and other groups. Active participants included Progressive Party leader Wallace, Georgia black community leader Dobbs, renowned black historian Du Bois, Republican National Committee member Howard, and former Assistant Attorney General Rogge. The conference decided to send delegations to various government departments to demand an end to measures that segregate black people and other racial discrimination. In his speech at the conference, Wilson fiercely criticized Truman for failing to fulfill his campaign promises regarding civil rights. He cited the fact that the murderers of black people recently assassinated in the United States have not been punished, saying that this "condemns the American law enforcement agencies and the Eighty-first Congress for failing to take measures to punish these crimes against humanity." Du Bois, in his capacity as a black leader in the Progressive Party, strongly urged black people not to limit their struggle to incidents of anti-lynching retaliation and anti-poll tax legislation. He declared that black people must strengthen internal unity and participate in the democratic ranks in the worldwide struggle against reaction and for democracy. Du Bois condemned the Democratic Party as incapable of fulfilling its campaign promises because it placed war preparations ahead of social progress. He called on black people to support the American Progressive Party. The conference opposed the segregation of black people in its resolution, condemning the U.S. government for ignoring or even destroying the constitutional guarantees of the historical rights of all American people.

　　美二十八州黑人和白人代表集会
  　要求终止种族歧视
    【新华社陕北十七日电】塔斯社华盛顿讯：美国“全国立法会议和要求终止种族歧视大会”于二月十二日结束。出席此一会议的，有一千二百余名黑人和白人代表，它们来自二十八州。这个会议是由以黑人领袖威尔逊为首的一部分著名人士所发起，并获得许多工会、宗教团体、进步党、人权保障大会和其他团体的赞助和积极支持。积极参加者有进步党领袖华莱士，乔治亚州黑人团体的首领道布斯，著名黑人历史学家杜波伊斯，共和党全国委员会委员霍瓦德，前助理司法部长罗奇等。大会决定派遣代表团分访政府各部，要求终止隔离黑人及其他种族歧视的措施。威尔逊在大会讲演中猛烈批评杜鲁门未能履行竞选时所作公民权利的诺言。他列举美国最近暗杀黑人的凶手都没有受到惩办的事实后说：这“宣判了美国执法机关和第八十一届国会未能采取措施来惩办这些违反人性的罪行”。杜波伊斯以进步党中黑人领袖的资格，极力敦促黑人不要把他们的斗争限制在反私刑报复和反人头税立法的事件上。他宣称：黑人必须加强内部团结，而且在全世界反动与民主的斗争中参加民主行列。杜波伊斯谴责民主党是不可能履行竞选诺言的，因为它将战争的准备摆在社会进步的前面。他号召黑人支持美国进步党。大会反对隔离黑人的决议，谴责美国政府不理甚至毁弃全体美国人民的历史权利宪法上的保障。
