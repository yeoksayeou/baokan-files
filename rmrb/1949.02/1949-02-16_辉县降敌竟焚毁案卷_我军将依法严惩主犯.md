Xinhua News Agency, North China, 13th. When the People's Liberation Army of Northern Henan accepted the surrender of the defending enemy in Huixian County, it discovered that the enemy's roster was forged, and the archives, files, and official documents of the Kuomintang party and government organs in Huixian County had also been burned. The enemy in Huixian County committed the crime specified in Article 1, Item 5, of the Order for the Punishment of War Criminals issued by the Chinese People's Liberation Army on November 1 last year, namely, "destroying communications equipment and burning all telegrams and archives." The People's Liberation Army of Northern Henan is now strictly investigating those who presided over this destruction and will severely punish them according to law.

　　辉县降敌竟焚毁案卷
  　我军将依法严惩主犯
    【新华社华北十三日电】豫北人民解放军在接受辉县守敌投降的时候，发现了敌人的花名册是伪造的，辉县国民党党政机关的档案、卷宗、公文等也已经被焚毁。辉县的敌人犯了中国人民解放军去年十一月一日发布的惩处战争罪犯命令中第一项第五条“破坏通讯器材，烧毁一切文电案卷”之罪。现豫北人民解放军正对主持此种破坏者严加追查，并将依法予以严惩。
