Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 10th: TASS Moscow dispatch: *Labor Daily* recently published an article commenting on the results of the World Federation of Trade Unions Executive Committee meeting that concluded in Paris on February 1st, stating: The main significance of the Paris meeting lies in its confirmation of the complete failure of the split plan of the Standing Committee of the British Trades Union Congress and the right-wing leaders of the American Congress of Industrial Organizations, who were acting on the orders of the Anglo-American bloc to undermine the international unity of trade unions from within. However, representatives of the largest trade unions from the five continents of Europe, Asia, the Americas, Africa, and Australia still attended this Executive Committee meeting, that is, representatives of 60 million trade union members, who participated in the meeting in order to maintain the unity of the trade union movement. *Labor Daily* pointed out: The World Federation of Trade Unions Executive Committee Paris meeting demonstrates the will of millions of working people to strengthen the forces of the democratic camp and to fight for unity. The World Federation of Trade Unions' decision to convene the Second World Federation of Trade Unions Congress on June 26th this year is of great significance. It will discuss the situation of trade unions around the world, stipulate the direction of the World Federation of Trade Unions' development, and draft the economic and social demands of working people in all countries. The decision to establish a World Federation of Trade Unions branch in China and to convene a representative meeting of trade unions from Asian countries is of particularly great importance for the development of the trade union movement in colonial and semi-colonial countries. *Labor Daily* pointed out: In the camp that supports trade union unity, one can see the growth of the World Federation of Trade Unions' strength and confidence in victory; in the camp of splitters, there is full of panic and confusion. The instigators who plot to sabotage the World Federation of Trade Unions have no mass support, whether in Europe, the East, or Latin America. Many contradictions also divide them. The American Federation of Labor, the Congress of Industrial Organizations, and the Standing Committee of the British Trades Union Congress are vying to organize a new international "center." There is not even unity among the leaders of the American trade unions. The Congress of Industrial Organizations leaders fear that their organization will be swallowed up by the American Federation of Labor, which is closer to Wall Street and the State Department. *Labor Daily* concluded: Having abandoned the splitters, the World Federation of Trade Unions has embarked on the road of fighting for peace and the happiness of all nations, for the vital interests of the working class, and for progress and democracy. These goals are uniting more and more millions of working people around the World Federation of Trade Unions.

    英美分裂计划失败
    ——劳动报评世界工联会议成果
    【新华社陕北十日电】塔斯社莫斯科讯：劳动报顷发表论文，评论二月一日在巴黎闭幕的世界职工联盟执委会会议的成果称：巴黎会议的主要意义，在于它确定了英国职工大会常委会与美国产联的右翼领袖们的分裂计划之完全失败，他们是奉行英美集团的命令而决定从内部破坏厂工会的国际团结的。但是出席这次执委会会议的仍有欧、亚、美、非、澳五大洲的最大职工会的代表，即是说，有六千万职工会会员的代表，为了保持职工运动的团结而参加了会议。劳动报指出：世界工联执委会巴黎会议表示出千百万劳动人民为加强民主阵营力量及为团结而奋斗的意志。世界工联决定在今年六月二十六日召开第二届世界工联代表大会，具有重大意义。该会将讨论全世界职工会的状况，规定世界工联发展的路线，并草拟世界各国劳动人民的经济与社会的要求。关于在中国成立世界工联分局并召开亚洲各国职工会代表会议的决定，对殖民地半殖民地国家职工运动的发展，也有特别巨大的重要性。劳动报指出：在拥护职工会团结的阵营里，可以看到世界工联的力量及胜利信心的增长；在分裂分子的阵营中则充满着惊慌与混乱。阴谋破坏世界工联的煽动者，不论在欧洲、东方或拉丁美洲都没有群众支持。不少的矛盾还分裂着他们自己。美国劳联、产联与英国职工大会常委会正在竞相争先组织一新的国际“中心”。甚至在美国职工会的领袖之间也没有团结。产联领袖惧怕他们的组织被更接近于华尔街与国务院的劳联所并吞。劳动报结语称：世界工联抛开了分裂分子之后，已走上为和平与一切民族的幸福，为工人阶级的切身利益，为进步与民主而斗争的道路。这些目的使越来越多的千百万劳动人民，团结在世界工厂周围。
