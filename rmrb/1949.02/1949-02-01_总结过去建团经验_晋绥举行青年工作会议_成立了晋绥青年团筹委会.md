Xinhua News Agency, Jin-Sui, 29th. The Jin-Sui liberated area held a youth work conference from the 5th to the 14th of this month, summarizing the experience of the past two years in the pilot establishment of the New Democratic Youth League, and formally established the Jin-Sui Liberated Area New Democratic Youth League Preparatory Committee to lead the future league-building work. Fifty-seven youth league cadres from various parts of Jin-Sui attended the meeting, and Luo Yi, a member of the Youth Work Committee of the Northwest Central Bureau of the Communist Party of China, was also sent to attend and provide guidance. In summarizing the past league-building work, the meeting reflected that the experiment of establishing the Youth League in some areas of Jin-Sui over the past two years has achieved certain results. There are now more than 4,000 Youth League members. In the past, these League members played an active role in leading the broad masses of youth in Jin-Sui to join the People's Liberation Army, support the People's Liberation War, carry out land reform, rectify the Party, develop production, and various construction undertakings. However, on the other hand, due to the lack of attention to youth work by the leading organs of the Communist Party of China in Jin-Sui, youth work was only pushed to a few youth cadres without timely and practical help and guidance. As a result, the league-building work in Jin-Sui over the past two years has not achieved the due and greater results. In order to enable the future league-building work in Jin-Sui to develop soundly and enter the right track, the meeting summarized and discussed the following important issues:

(1) Implement the policy of the whole Party making efforts to establish the New Democratic Youth League. First of all, it is necessary to correct some incorrect perceptions of some Communist Party member cadres regarding youth work. For example, they think that: "Youth work is dispensable," "There is no front for rural youth work, and there is nothing to do," "The task is heavy, and there is no time," "Youth work is the business of youth cadres," etc., which are obviously wrong. According to a survey of seven counties and fourteen natural villages in the Jin-Sui Liberated Area, young men and women account for 13% of the total population. If we add children aged seven to fourteen, there are approximately 550,000 youth, teenagers, and children out of the 2.2 million people in Jin-Sui. Generally, young workers in factories account for about 60% of all workers, and schools are concentrated places for youth and teenagers. This shows that the broad masses of youth need to be organized, youth work is one of the important tasks at present, and there is still a vast front in rural areas. For example, Lin County, Lishi, and the public factories under the Industrial Department of the Jin-Sui Military Region of the People's Liberation Army, which have achieved better results in the League over the past two years, have attached importance to youth work, overcome the incorrect understanding existing in the minds of cadres, equipped youth cadres, and regularly checked, summarized, and promoted experience. Therefore, the establishment of the League is more common, and the organization of the Youth League in the factories is relatively sound. The Youth League members in the factories have played a great role in promoting production. For example, among the seventy-two meritorious workers in the meritorious service campaign of the Industrial Department's Second Factory, thirty-two were Youth League members.

(2) The establishment of the Youth League must be combined with other central tasks. For example, the Secretary of the Communist Party Committee of the Ninth District of Lin County personally led the Party branch in Anjiazhuang to mobilize young people to participate in Party rectification. During the Party rectification, a separate youth meeting was held to carry out ideological education and publicize the importance of establishing the Youth League. As a result, Party rectification achieved results, and groups of young peasant men and women requested to join the League, and the peasant masses also strongly supported the establishment of the League. However, some areas have failed to pay attention to this issue, only conducting league-building in isolation, divorced from the overall work, making league-building a burden for the masses. Therefore, in the future, it is necessary to cooperate with Party rectification and the end of land reform, spring plowing production, mobilizing support for the Liberation War, and joining the People's Liberation Army to absorb young people to participate and give play to their role. At the same time, organizational education should be carried out among young people to raise their ideological awareness, and then start building the League.

(3) League-building should be carried out on the basis of extensive publicity, education, and mobilizing young people to consciously and voluntarily join the League. In some places, the method of league-building is simplified, simply calling on young people to sign up and holding one or two general meetings. As a result, the youth masses think that "the higher-ups asked to participate, and we have to participate." In individual places, there are even cases of forcing young people to participate, leading to misunderstandings and parents preventing their children from joining the League. In other individual factories, candidates for League members are proposed, and people in the factory hold democratic votes and evaluations, and whoever is elected must participate. In some places, only a few advanced young people are organized, or overly high conditions are put forward for the qualifications of League members to restrict young people from joining the League. Some simply call on League members to "play a role" and "take the lead" while ignoring their education. The above-mentioned biases must be quickly overcome. League-building should be combined with various tasks to publicize and explain to the youth masses the nature and tasks of the League, the conditions for League members, and the spirit of the draft League Constitution, etc., and the application should be mainly in the form of individual applications, while soliciting public opinion, and then formally approved by the League headquarters before absorbing young people to join the League. The Youth League must become the core of uniting the broad masses of young people and a school for educating young people with Marxism-Leninism.

(4) Enrich and enliven the life of the Youth League and establish regular work. In some rural areas where the Youth League has been established in Jin-Sui, it is often tight at first and then loose. It is very grand when the League is established, and then the content of the League's work and life is not enriched, allowing it to gradually decline. Or there is a phenomenon that "when the cadres who are carrying out league-building work are present, the League has activities; when the league-building cadres leave, the League's activities stop." In the future, in addition to participating in general work, the Youth League should pay close attention to solving the immediate interests of League members and the general youth, carry out education and cultural and recreational activities, strengthen the work system of the League branch, and improve the organizational structure.

As for Jin-Sui's future league-building plan, the meeting believes that it should shift from the sporadic pilot period of the past to a stage of planned and focused universal promotion, that is, to universally build the League in factories, schools, large villages and towns in the Jin-Sui Liberated Area. At present, preparations are being made to train and equip the necessary league-building cadres, accept the experience and lessons of past league-building work, and carry out league-building work in a planned manner in accordance with the spirit of the "Resolution on the Establishment of the Chinese New Democratic Youth League" issued by the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China on January 1st, and the "Draft Constitution of the Chinese New Democratic Youth League".

Finally, at the closing meeting on the 14th, the Jin-Sui Liberated Area New Democratic Youth League Preparatory Committee was formally established, and Zhao Lin, Yuan Ligang, Wu Rulong (female), Zhang Jian, Hu Keshi, and others were elected as sixteen preparatory committee members, and Zhao Lin was publicly elected as the chairman, and Hu Keshi and Yuan Ligang were elected as the vice-chairmen, and the Preparatory Committee was responsible for promoting the league-building work in Jin-Sui. On the 23rd, the Preparatory Committee telegraphed the Youth Work Committee of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China, expressing its full support for the "Resolution on the Establishment of the Chinese New Democratic Youth League" of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China, and that the first National Congress of the League will be held this summer to formally establish the League's organization and elect the Central Committee of the League. At the same time, the Preparatory Committee warmly responded to the proposal made by the All-China Liberated Areas Youth Federation on the 16th of this month to hold a National Youth Representative Conference on this year's "May 4th" Chinese Youth Day.

　　总结过去建团经验
  　晋绥举行青年工作会议
    成立了晋绥青年团筹委会
    【新华社晋绥二十九日电】晋绥解放区于本月五日至十四日举行了青年工作会议，总结了过去两年来试行建立新民主主义青年团的工作经验，并正式成立了晋绥解放区新民主主义青年团筹备委员会，领导今后建团工作。出席会议的有晋绥各地青年团干部五十七人，中共西北中央局也派青年工作委员会委员罗毅同志出席指导。会议在总结过去建团工作中，反映出：两年来晋绥在部分地区试验建立青年团，是有一定成绩的。青年团员现在已有四千余人。这些团员过去在领导晋绥广大青年参加人民解放军和支援人民解放战争，进行土地改革、整党、发展生产和各种建设事业中，都起了积极的推动作用。但另一方面，由于中共晋绥党的领导机关对于青年工作不够重视，只是将青年工作推给少数青年干部去做而没有加以及时的、切实的帮助和指导。因此，使两年来晋绥的建团工作，不能取得应有的、更大的成绩。为了使今后晋绥的建团工作能够健全发展，步入正规，会议总结和讨论了以下几个重要问题：
    （一）贯彻共产党全党努力建立新民主主义青年团的方针。首先，必须改正某些中共党员干部对于青年工作的某些不正确的认识。例如认为：“青年工作可有可无”，“农村青年工作没有阵地，没有什么可做的”，“任务繁忙，没有时间”，“青年工作是青年干部的事”等等，显然都是错误的。根据晋绥解放区七个县十四个自然村的调查，男女青年占全人口百分之十三。如果加上七岁以上到十四岁的少年、儿童，晋绥二百二十万人口中，青年、少年、儿童约有五十五万人。而一般工厂中的青年工人约占全体工人百分之六十，学校则为青年、少年集中之所。这说明广大青年需要组织起来，青年工作是当前重要工作之一，在农村中仍有广大的阵地。如两年来各团成绩较好的临县、离石及人民解放军晋绥军区工业部所属各公营工厂，即由于各该县和各该厂的中共党委重视青年工作，克服了干部思想上存在的不正确认识，配备青年干部，经常检查总结青年工作，推广经验，所以建团较为普遍，工厂中青年团的组织也比较健全。工厂的青年团员们在生产中起了极大的推动作用。如工业部第二厂立功运动中的七十二个功臣中，青年团员即占三十二人。
    （二）建立青年团工作必须与其他中心工作结合。如临县九区中共区委书记亲自在安家庄领导中共党的支部发动青年参加整党，在整党中单独召开青年会议，进行思想教育工作，并宣传建立青年团的重要性。结果，整党获得成绩，成群青年农民农妇要求参加团，农民群众也很赞成建团。但有些地区未能注意这一问题，只是孤立地进行建团，与整个工作脱节，使建团成为群众的负担。因此，今后必须配合整党及结束土地改革、春耕生产、动员支援解放战争和参加解放军等工作中，吸收青年参加，发挥其作用。同时，在青年中进行组织教育，提高他们的思想觉悟，然后才着手建团。
    （三）在广泛宣传教育、发动青年自觉自愿入团的基础上来进行建团。有些地方建团方式简单化，只是号召青年报名，开上一两个大会即算了，以致青年群众认为“上边叫参加，不能不参加”。个别地方甚至发生勉强青年参加，以致引起误会，发生父母阻止儿女入团的事情，亦有个别工厂提出团员候选人，由工厂里的人举行民主投票与评议，选上谁谁就得参加等现象。另有一些地方则仅仅组织少数先进青年分子，或对团员资格，提出过高的条件，来限制青年入团。有的则是单纯地叫团员“起作用”、“打先锋”，而忽视对于他们的教育。上述这些偏向，必须迅速地加以克服。建团应配合各种工作，向青年群众进行宣传解释关于团的性质、任务、团员条件、团章草案的精神等，并以个人申请方式为主，同时征求群众意见，再经团部正式批准，然后吸收青年入团。必须使青年团成为团结广大青年的核心，是以马克思、列宁主义教育青年的学校。
    （四）充实与活跃青年团的生活，建立经常工作。晋绥部分已建立青年团的农村，常是先紧后松，建团时很隆重，以后即未充实团的工作与生活内容，任其逐渐消沉下去。或是发生“进行建团工作的干部在，团有活动；建团干部走，团的活动就停顿”的现象。今后青年团除参加一般工作外，更应密切注意解决团员和一般青年的切身利益，进行教育与文化娱乐活动，加强团支部的工作制度，健全组织机构。
    至于晋绥今后的建团计划，会议认为应从过去那种零散的试办时期，转入有步骤、有重点地普遍推广的阶段，即要在晋绥解放区的工厂、学校、大村镇中普遍建团。目前正准备训练和配备必要的建团干部，接受过去建团工作的经验教训，按照中共中央一月一日发表的“关于建立中国新民主主义青年团的决议”的精神，以及“中国新民主主义青年团团章草案”，有计划地开展建团工作。
    最后，会议在十四日的闭幕大会上，正式成立了晋绥解放区新民主主义青年团筹备委员会，选出赵林、袁力刚、吴如珑（女）、张坚、胡克实等十六人为筹备委员，并公推赵林为主任委员，胡克实、袁力刚为副主任委员，由寿委会负责推动晋绥的建团工作。又筹委会于二十三日致电中共中央青年工作委员会，表示完全拥护中共中央“关于建立中国新民主主义青年团的决议”，在今年夏季召开团的第一次全国代表大会，正式成立团的组织，选举团的中央委员会。同时，该会又热烈响应中国解放区青年联合会本月十六日所提于今年“五四”中国青年节召开全国青年代表会议的建议。
