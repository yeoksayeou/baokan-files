　　Utilizing Alkaline Land to Grow Flax
  　Li Xianhang Reaps Significant Profits
    [Our News] Li Xianhang's family, from Lizhou Village, Fourth District, Jixian County, Jinnan, has 1.2 mu of alkaline land. Every year, they sow seeds three or four times, but the seedlings never sprout. The year before last, in the first month of the lunar calendar, they planted flax seeds in Jiulitian, and replanted once in April, planting the flax in half-filled pits, with each plant spaced one step apart. As a result, they achieved full seedling emergence. The year before last, they harvested 120 jin of flax seeds, which they exchanged for 34 jin of peanut oil, solving their lighting oil needs for the winter and the New Year. Currently, flax seeds are selling for 700 yuan (RMB) per jin on the market, which is more profitable than harvesting from good land. Last year, they harvested 300 jin of flax stalks for firewood. By mixing flax husks and leaves with soil to ferment manure, they obtained eight cartloads of fertilizer, which not only enriched the soil but also prevented mole crickets. By burning flax husks into ashes and sprinkling them on water-soaked old cotton batting, then pounding them twice with an ax and drying them in the sun, they created tinder.

　　利用碱地种麻子
  　李仙航获利很大
    【本报消息】冀南冀县四区李周村李仙航家，有碱地一亩二分，年年下三四回种也不拿苗，前年正月，在九里天就种上麻子，四月里又补种一次，把麻子种在半坑土里，每棵要距离一步远。结果得到全苗；前年收麻子仁一百二十斤，换花生油三十四斤，解决了一冬天的点灯油和年节需用；现麻子仁每斤市价（人民币）七百元，比好地收获还丰富。去年收了麻秸柴三百斤，用麻子皮和叶子掺土沤粪八车，肥料又壮，还能防止蝼蛄。把麻子皮烧成灰，撒在被水浸透的旧棉花套子上，用斧子砸两遍，晒干后就成了火绒子。
