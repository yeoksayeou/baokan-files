Editor's Note: Lin County trained party members by actively educating them to understand the history of revolutionary development and its great future, to study the correct principles of the Party Constitution and Program, and to overcome certain narrow and erroneous viewpoints. According to our understanding, in many places, basic knowledge education for party members in the past was insufficient, resulting in blindness and ignorance in their work. Lin County's method of concentrated training is of great significance for Party rectification and Party building.

Lin County adopted the method of district-based concentrated training of party members to deploy the work of ending land reform. This could both improve the party members and smoothly and universally carry out the work of ending land reform. The third batch of training included 249 villages, training a total of 4,130 people, including some members of the masses and women. The duration was seven days, and the experience is as follows:

(1) Carry out current and future education to raise awareness and encourage the determination to carry the revolution through to the end.

During the training, it was understood that some party members could not distinguish the nature of the current war and did not clearly understand the relationship between the War of Liberation and the interests of the masses. Therefore, when party members publicized current events to the masses, they could only broadcast victory news and could not raise the political awareness of the masses. This time, the various regions trained party members, focusing on this issue, not only explaining the victorious situation, but also making them aware of the nature of the War of Liberation and its relationship with the interests of the masses. The leadership further guided everyone to compare and analyze from the facts of their own personal experiences: we are leading the masses to turn over everywhere, while the Kuomintang is leading the landlords to settle accounts; we are establishing representative meetings, where everyone is in charge and implementing true democracy, while in the past, the chiefs and landlords were in power, corrupt, and extorting people; our liberated areas are independent and autonomous, for the sake of national liberation, while the Kuomintang sold China by land, sea, and air, and American soldiers could rape Chinese women at will, and cars run over Chinese people; we provide loans and lend grain everywhere to help the masses produce, while the Kuomintang plunders the masses everywhere, and the property of the four major families is all the blood and sweat of the masses. This clarified the nature of the war. The Twelfth District, in analyzing the correct leadership of the Party, felt from their own personal experience that Chairman Mao and the Party Central Committee's leadership was correct, and also affirmed that all party members faithfully completed the Party's tasks. This made the party members aware of the integrity of the Party and enlightened them to their sense of responsibility to the Party and the people. After such study, the Fifth District improved its interest, and everyone said, "We can't relax. We have turned over, and we still have to help the people across the country to turn over! We must liberate the class brothers throughout the country!" A party member from the First District said, "Now the war is between people and wolves! If you don't kill the wolves, it will always be a great harm!" Some said, "Fighting Chiang Kai-shek is like weeding, you have to pull out the roots, if you don't pull out the roots now, it will sprout again next spring." Combined with such discussions, education on supporting the front lines, participating in the war, giving preferential treatment to soldiers, and storing grain was carried out, which improved political awareness and overcame insufficient understanding of the war.

(2) Make party members aware of the Party's history of arduous struggle and inspire the revolutionary spirit of advancement.

Some party members do not know the Party's history of arduous struggle, and therefore feel that they have made great contributions, do not accept criticism from the masses, complain about Party rectification, and feel that they have been wronged. This time, Party history education was carried out, explaining that the Party has experienced various revolutionary periods and has grown stronger through the bloodshed of countless martyrs. Connect this with specific facts of the glorious sacrifice of the martyrs. This transformed the emotions of the party members, who automatically reviewed their own backward thoughts. After hearing the Party history, a party member in the Fifth District kept thinking: "What did the martyrs sacrifice for?" Some party members in Luzhai in the Twelfth District reviewed and said: "I used to think that my own contribution was so great that the masses should not give me opinions. Compared with the martyrs, this idea is really wrong!" Some districts reviewed and said: "We are far behind the martyrs! They encountered mountains, and we encountered cotton bales." A party member in Weijiazhuang reviewed and said: "I just hated work. When I saw others producing and making money, I didn't want to do it anymore. When I heard the Party history, I heard that the martyrs were not afraid of sacrificing their blood for the masses. Compared with myself, it was really wrong." A party member in Wujiazhui reviewed and said: "The Party is leading the masses! But I became the tail of the masses, only saying backward words, which is not right." A party member in Digou Village in the Seventh District said, "Let's do it, we are far behind the martyrs, we have to study hard and work hard!" The branch in Lijiazhuang in the First District had sectarianism. After hearing the Party history, they began to think: Who are we fighting for? Compared with the old revolutionaries, it is really very different! In the process of explaining Party history, from the study of why the Party has developed and grown in difficulties, they realized that it is due to the correctness of the Party's program, propositions, and policies, that the Party is the savior of the masses, that the masses follow the Party, and that the Party cannot be separated from the masses at any time in the struggle. In addition, the party members have unlimited loyalty to the Party, the Party has strict organizational life and discipline, regular criticism and self-criticism, and at the same time, they recognize the correctness of Chairman Mao's leadership. In this way, the ideological construction of party members was carried out in the process of explaining Party history, and at the same time, they realized the role of each party branch in the revolution. The Ninth District combined the history of the struggle of the Ninth District branch when explaining Party history, and the result was very good. The secretary of Pang Village was ideologically very backward and had been lying down for nearly a year. He was unwilling to come to the meeting this time. Later, after explaining Party history and the history of the branch's struggle, he saw the future of the revolution and his thinking changed.

(3) Carry out Party program education, recognize the revolutionary road and future, and improve proletarian thinking.

Some party members, because their consciousness has not been improved one step further, are at the level of general peasant consciousness, so with the victory against feudalism and the end of land reform, they feel that the revolution has been successful and there is nothing to do. In addition, they cannot correctly resolve the relationship between the individual and the Party, the individual and the people in their thinking, so they feel that the revolution has suffered a loss and that their work lacks vitality. This time, Party program education was generally carried out in the training class, so that they could recognize the revolutionary road and future, point out that now is the time to realize a New Democratic society, and in the future, a communist society will be realized. Only then will there be a classless, exploitation-free society where everyone does their best and takes what they need, the most happy society for mankind. Now, in the countryside, only by organizing production can everyone become rich, so that they can recognize the new road after land reform. In the Eleventh and Fifth District training classes, after recognizing the old and new roads, a female party member in Ren Village said: "We used to suffer, but now we have turned over, so we must lead well! If we don't lead, we will return to the old road, the masses have no future, and we have no future, isn't it the same as being poor?" A party member in Luzhai, one laborer, was farming ten acres of land, seven acres of flat land and three acres of mountain land. This year, he happened to be carrying loads outside when planting, so he missed planting. The seven acres of flat land only yielded a little over one stone of grain, and now life is very difficult. Another party member was farming the land himself. This year he was sick and the donkey died, so the land was abandoned and less grain was harvested. From analyzing these two examples, it was clear that they must be organized in order to get rich, otherwise they would inevitably be poor. At the same time, it was explained that in order to transform from an agricultural country to an industrial country, it would be necessary to open canals, build factories, and develop mutual assistance and cooperation in the future, so that agriculture could continue to develop, but it was also necessary to pay attention to overcoming its absolute egalitarian thinking and establishing its thinking of getting rich through labor. After clarifying the future, it is necessary to establish the Party's leadership thinking, only with the Party's leadership can the new road be realized! Only then can a happy society be achieved! The First and Tenth Districts explained from history the reasons for the failure of Li Zicheng and the Lin County peasant movement, which was the lack of Communist Party leadership. Today, to overthrow the old society and build a new society, there must be Party leadership. After this education, some party members said: "I never thought that the Party's responsibility was so great! We still have to build a new society! We can't get off the revolution halfway!" A party member in the Fifth District said: "I only know that we should climb out of the old society and walk into the new society! If the Party doesn't lead, we will return to the old society, I have to work hard!" In addition to this, they were also made to recognize from the perspective of the great interests of the revolution that only the liberation of the people's cause can completely liberate themselves, and to recognize that their own interests and the interests of the masses are basically consistent. For example, by leading the masses to turn over, they also turned over themselves. In the future, leading the masses to realize organized wealth creation, and transforming from an agricultural country to an industrial country, they will also be able to increase production in the same way, and in a socialist society, they will be as happy as the masses. However, without the Party's leadership, the masses and themselves are inevitably poor, and they cannot reach a happy society. In this way, the party members' sense of purpose began to be established, and some temporary contradictions between individual interests and the people's interests were overcome, so that the party members could move forward regularly.

(4) Carry out education on the Party's democratic centralism and strengthen organizational viewpoints.

This time, the conditions, rights, and obligations of party members, and the Party's democratic centralism: all party members should unconditionally obey the Party's organization, the minority should obey the majority, the lower level should obey the higher level, the whole party should obey the Central Committee, and basic knowledge such as carrying out criticism and self-criticism within the Party were specifically explained. Because at present, there is lax organizational life in the branches, they cannot conscientiously and fully implement the Party's resolutions, they act from personal standpoints, engage in sectarianism, and are not united; moreover, there is a lack of democracy within the Party, a lack of criticism and self-criticism, they think that criticism is offensive, they look at emotions, forming a patriarchal leadership of several main cadres, and other party members cannot play a role; party members also have many incorrect understandings of the Party's organization. All of this prevents the Party from truly becoming the vanguard organization of the proletariat and from forming a true leadership core. This time, specialized education in this area was carried out, criticizing sectarianism, detachment from the masses, destruction of policies, non-implementation of Party resolutions, and actions that violate organizational principles. After attending Party lectures, party members in the Fifth District reflected: "I should throw away my former thoughts, firmly stand on the Party's position, obey transfers, and abide by discipline!" "If I don't obey the organization, the revolutionary work will not be good, I will firmly obey the Party's organization in the future." Some reviewed: "In the past, our branch did not have criticism and self-criticism, whoever made a suggestion would hold a grudge, this is not right." "In the past, I didn't know what the Communist Party was, I only knew how to lead struggles, I used to do it blindly, and I didn't review even if I made mistakes." The secretary of Honghe branch in the Seventh District reviewed: "I was leading by doing everything myself, not consulting with everyone, and not being able to give full play to everyone's strength." Many party members did not know these organizational principles, so they vulgarized the Party in their minds and lacked organizational concepts. This time, this was used as a ruler for party members to carry out criticism. Everyone was required to carry out criticism and self-criticism within the Party based on the Party's principles, to solve the problems of disunity within the Party and the relationship between the Party and the masses, and to establish various systems within the Party. This is not just to solve the problems of the branch on a case-by-case basis, but to improve the party members one step further, so the problems of the branch can be solved smoothly. On the issue of sectarianism, such as in the First District, the chairman of the Farmers' Association and the war service committee in Lijiazhuang were engaged in sectarianism, which greatly harmed the work. They reviewed: "Are we fighting for the Party or for ourselves? Who is it good for?" Both parties reviewed their sectarian actions, and the war service committee member said: "When I was engaged in sectarianism with the chairman of the Farmers' Association, the landlord gave me the idea, saying: "You are struggling with him, and you feel tired in your heart, but you still have to treat him well on the surface." As a result, I used the method of buying him over, asking him to eat eggs, and asking him to gamble, which was exploited by the class enemy, which was a big mistake." In Zhaidi in the Tenth District, there was a "North-South Dynasty" sectarianism. After attending Party lectures, they recognized their mistakes from the harm to the Party, and both parties made reviews. In Dongnao Village in the Seventh District, the village chief and the chairman of the Farmers' Association were engaged in sectarianism. Everyone studied, why were we so united when we started the struggle, but why did we start sectarianism when we divided the fruits? They recognized that this was the backward thinking of selfishness and personal enjoyment. The failure of the Lin County peasant uprising in the past was due to this. If we want the revolution to succeed, all of our party members should proceed from the interests of the Party, not from their own interests. After such analysis, the sectarianism was seriously reviewed. In resolving the relationship between the Party and the masses, a party member in Duanjiapo in the First District reviewed: "My administrative command style is very strong. I don't accept criticism from higher levels. The higher levels asked me to calculate how many people are following me. I said there were more than 20 people. As a result, when I returned to the village, I carefully checked and there were only four people. Later, two more people argued with me, leaving only two people. Can such detachment from the masses still carry out work?" The organizational committee member of the Nanmaxiang branch in the Fifth District had a very strong administrative command. He did not review at first, and everyone launched criticism against him, pointing out: It is right to actively complete the task, but it is wrong to attack the masses. He was also asked to calculate how many people were really following him. He finally made a review and recognized the danger of detachment from the masses. The small branch secretary of the Seventh District was seriously undemocratic inside and outside the Party, and acted arbitrarily. Whoever gave him opinions, he would attack. This time, the party members understood the Party's democratic centralism. Everyone said: "We didn't understand in the past, so we didn't dare to criticize you. Your detachment from the masses has damaged the Party's influence, which is not right." Under everyone's criticism, he made a preliminary review. In addition, in Sanzhai Village in the Twelfth District, the vice chairman of the Farmers' Association was afraid of Party rectification, and became the tail of the masses. When the masses said backward words, he also said backward words, deliberately showing that he was not united with the Party. Everyone criticized this as a serious mistake. Party members should constantly improve the consciousness of the masses, not cater to the backwardness of the masses. Only by patiently improving the consciousness of the masses and truly serving the masses can they truly unite the masses. - After criticism and self-criticism within the Party, the problems of the branch were resolved, and then various systems within the Party were established, such as meeting reports, criticism, and other systems.

In this training, district cadres also used the proletarian standards to examine themselves, which promoted criticism and self-criticism among all party members. The party members truly recognized that the Party is democratically centralized, and at the same time, the relationship between higher and lower levels was closer. Li Yitai, a district cadre in the First District, first examined his own sectarian thinking at the meeting of the Lijiazhuang branch after attending Party lectures, which aroused serious review in the branch. Niu Zhongshan, the secretary of the Mutual District Party Committee, made a review at the party member congress after studying Party history and the Party Constitution, and stated that he would work hard in the future, serve the masses wholeheartedly, obey the Party's transfer, and have no objections to crossing rivers and mountains. He would patiently lead the masses and strive to build a new democratic society. The district cadres' review was very enlightening and moving for the party members, and the county party committee also made appropriate self-criticism.

(5) Study the Party's policies and establish policy thinking.

Some party members in the branch were not very conscious in implementing the Party's policies, often starting from personal standpoints, and thinking that the policies were specifically restricting people, not understanding that the policies were formulated by the Party based on the will of the broad masses of the people, and that the revolution could not succeed without correct policies. This time, because the education of the Party's proletarian thinking was carried out, they began to jump out of the narrow circle of individual peasants, so the study of the Party's policies was relatively smooth. This time, they studied various policies on Party rectification and the end of land reform, recognized the purpose of ending land reform, and from experiencing the spirit of each policy, they also recognized the class nature of the policies, and recognized the importance of the policies. At the same time, they also specifically studied each policy, what is left-leaning? What is right-leaning? What are the dangers of left and right-leaning? Therefore, they initially turned the implementation of policies into a conscious action.

　　林县集训党员经验
    林县县委会
    编者按：林县集训党员，以积极的教育使农村党员认识了革命发展的历史及其伟大的前程，学习了党纲党章的正确原则，克服了某些狭隘的错误观点，根据我们的了解，许多地方过去对党员进行党的基本知识教育是不够的，以致造成工作中的盲目与无知。林县这种集训的方法，对于整党与建党都有很大作用。
    　　　　　　
    林县结束土地改革工作，是采取了分区集训党员的办法布置的，这样既可把党员提高一步，同时使结束土地改革工作顺利的普遍的开展起来。第三批集训村庄有二百四十九个，共训练了四千一百三十人，其中有一部群众和妇女，时间是七天，经验如下：
　　（一）进行时事前途教育，提高觉悟，鼓舞了革命到底的决心。
    在训练当中了解：有些党员分不清目前战争的性质，对解放战争与群众利益的关系认识不清楚，因之党员在向群众宣传时事时，只能广播胜利消息，而不能提高群众的政治觉悟。这次各地训练党员，便针对着这一问题，不仅说明了胜利形势，而且使其认识解放战争的性质，与群众利益的关系。领导上更引导大家从切身体验的事实中对比，分析出：我们是到处领导群众翻身，而国民党则领导地主倒算；我们是成立代表会，大家当家实行真正的民主，而从前保长地主当道，贪污腐化讹人；我们解放区独立自主，为了民族解放；而国民党则把中国从水陆空卖个干净，美国兵可以随便奸淫中国妇女，汽车轧死中国人；我们处处贷粮贷款，帮助群众生产，而国民党处处掠夺群众，四大家族的财产，都是群众的血汗。这样分清了战争的性质。十二区在分析党的正确领导时，从切身体验中更感到毛主席、党中央的领导正确，同时也肯定了全体党员忠实的完成党的任务，这样使党员认识了党的整体性，并启发了对党对人民的责任感。五区经过这样学习提高了兴趣，大家说：“我们不能松气，我们翻了身，还得帮助全国群众闹翻身哩！解放全国的阶级弟兄才行哩！”一区党员说：“现在战争是人和狼打哩！不把狼一下打死终久是个大害呀！”有的说：“打老蒋和锄草一样，非连根锄掉不行，现在不把根锄掉，明年春季又发芽了。”结合着这样讨论，进行支援前线、参战、优军、屯粮的教育，提高了政治觉悟，克服了对战争认识的不足。
　　（二）使党员认识党的艰苦奋斗历史，启发革命前进心。
    有些党员不知道党的艰苦奋斗的历史，因而自觉功劳很大，不接受群众批评，对整党发牢骚，感到他冤枉。这次进行了党史教育，说明党经历了各个革命时期，是无数先烈流了鲜血而壮大起来的。联系着说明先烈光荣牺牲的具体事实。这样转变了党员的情感，自动的检讨开自己落后思想，五区党员听到党史后一直在想：“人家先烈牺牲是为的啥呢？”十二区芦砦有的党员检讨说：“我从前光觉自己功劳大的不行，群众不该对自己提意见，比起先烈这思想真不对呀！”有的区检讨说：“咱比起先烈可差远哩！人家碰的是山，咱碰的是棉花垛。”魏家庄党员检讨说：“我光讨厌工作，看到别人生产赚钱，我就不想干了，我一听党史，听到先烈为群众不怕牺牲流血，自己一比，真是不对了。”吴家水一个党员检讨说：“党是领导群众哩！可是我当了群众尾巴，光说落后话，这是不应当的。”七区底沟村党员说：“咱们干吧，比起先烈差的远哩，咱可得好好学习，好好干哩！”一区李家庄支部有宗派，听罢党史便开始想：咱闹宗派是为谁呢？比起革命老前辈，真是大不一样呀！在讲党史中，从研究党为什么在困难中发展壮大呢？使其认识：是由于党的纲领、主张、政策的正确，党是群众的救星，群众跟着党走，党在斗争中一时一刻也不能脱离群众。另外是党员对党的无限忠诚，党有严格的组织生活与纪律，经常的批评与自我批评，同时认识毛主席领导的正确。这样便在讲党史中进行了党员的思想建设，同时也使其认识到每个党员支部在革命中的作用。九区便是讲党史时结合着讲九区支部奋斗史的，结果很好，庞村支书思想很落后，躺倒将近一年，这次开会也不愿来，后来经过讲党史与支部奋斗史，看到革命前途，思想才转变了。
　　（三）进行党纲教育，认清革命道路与前途，提高无产阶级思想。
    有些党员由于觉悟未提高一步，处于一般农民的觉悟水平，所以跟着反封建的胜利土地改革的结束，而感到革命成功了，而没有事干。另外是不能从思想上正确解决个人与党、个人与人民关系，因之，感到革命吃了亏，工作无朝气。这次训练班中普遍的进行了党纲教育，使其认清革命的道路与前途，指出现在是实现新民主主义社会，将来实现共产主义社会，只有到那时才是无阶级无剥削各尽所能各取所需人类最幸福的社会。现在在农村里，只有组织起来生产，才能使人人发家致富，使其认识土地改革后的新道路。十一区、五区训练班中，在认识新老道路后，任村一个女党员说：“咱从前受罪现在翻了身，可得好好领导才行哩！咱不领导就要恢复到旧道路，群众无前途，自己也无前途，还不是一样受穷呀？”芦砦一个党员一个劳力，种着十亩地，平地七亩，山地三亩，今年种地时恰是自己在外边担挑运输，结果误了种地，七亩平地，只打一石多谷子，现在生活很困难。另一个党员是自己一个人种地，今年自己病了，驴也死了，结果地荒了，少打了粮食。从分析这二个人的例子中，明确了必须组织起来才能发家致富，否则仍是免不了贫困。同时说明了要由农业国变成工业国，以后还必需到处开渠、修工厂、发展互助合作，才能使农业继续向前发展，但也必须注意克服其绝对平均思想，树立其劳动发家思想。明确前途后，便须树立党的领导思想，只有党的领导，才能实现新道路哩！才能达到幸福的社会！一区、十区从历史上说明李闯王和林县农民运动失败的原因，便是有没共产党的领导。今天推翻旧社会，建设新社会，必须有党的领导才行，经过这样教育后，有的党员说：“我就没想到党的责任这样大哩！还要建设新社会哩！咱革命不能半路下车呀！”五区党员说：“我才知道从旧社会爬出来，往新社会里走才中呢！党要不领导还会回到旧社会哩，我可要好好干哩！”除此以外，同时使其从革命远大利益上来认识，只有人民事业的解放成功，才能彻底解放自己，并使认识到自己利益和群众利益基本上的一致性，比如领导群众翻了身，而自己也翻了身。今后领导群众实现组织起来发家致富，由农业国变成工业国，自己也会同样能增加生产，到社会主义社会，也会和群众一样幸福。但是没党的领导，群众与自己都是免不了贫困的，都是到达不到幸福社会的。这样开始树立党员的事业精神，而克服个人利益与人民利益的某些暂时的矛盾，使党员能经常的前进。
　　（四）进行党的民主集中制的教育，加强组织观点。
    这次专门讲解了党员的条件、权利与义务，及党内民主集中制：一切党员个人应无条件的服从党的组织，少数服从多数，下级服从上级，全党服从中央，及开展党内的批评与自我批评等基本知识。因为目前支部中存在着组织生活松懈，不能认真的十足的执行党的决议，从个人出发，闹宗派，不团结；更加党内缺乏民主，缺乏批评与自我批评，以为批评是惹人，看情面，形成几个主要干部家长式的领导，其他党员不能发挥作用；党员对党的组织也产生很多不正确的认识。凡此一切都妨碍着党不能真正成为无产阶级先锋队的组织，不能形成真正的领导核心。这次专门进行了这方面的教育，批判了闹宗派、脱离群众破坏政策、不执行党的决议、违犯组织原则的行动。经过上党课后，五区党员反映说：“我应当把从前思想扔掉，坚决站到党的立场上，服从调动，遵守纪律才是哩！”“不服从组织，革命工作就闹不好，我今后坚决服从党的组织。”有的检讨出：“过去咱支部里没有批评和自我批评，谁一提意见就记仇，这不对。”“过去我就不知道共产党是啥，只知道领导斗争，过去是盲目干，有错也不检讨。”七区洪河支书检讨说：“我是包办领导，不和大家商量，不能发挥大家力量。”党员对这些组织原则很多是不知道的，因而思想上把党庸俗化了，而缺乏组织观念，这次便以此作为党员开展批评的尺子。要求大家依据党的原则，开展党内批评与自我批评，解决党内不团结与党群关系问题，建立党内各种制度。这样不只是就事论事的解决支部问题，而是把党员提高一步，所以解决支部问题时就顺利。在宗派问题上，如一区李家庄农会主席和战勤委员闹宗派，使工作吃了很大亏。他们检讨：“咱闹宗派是为党呢？为自己呢？对谁有利呢？”双方便把宗派行动作了检讨，战勤委员说：“我和农会主席闹宗派，地主给我出主意说：“你和他闹，心里吃劲，可是表面还得待他好才行。”结果我就用收买办法，叫他吃鸡蛋，叫他赌钱，被阶级敌人利用了，是个大错。”十区砦底有“南北朝”的宗派，经过上党课从对党的危害上认识了错误，而双方都作了检讨。七区东垴村村长和农会主席闹宗派，大家研究了，为什么咱们开始斗争时很团结，而到分果实时怎闹开了宗派呢？便认清了这是自私自利，个人享乐的落后思想。从前林县农民起义失败，便失败到这地方了。要想革命成功，我们党员都该从党的利益出发，不该从自己利益出发。经过这样分析，把宗派认真地进行了检讨。在解决党群关系上，一区段家坡一个党员检讨说：“我行政命令作风很厉害，上级批评我，我不接受，上级叫我算一算有多少群众跟着我走，我说有廿多人，结果我回村一细检查，只四个人，后来又有两个人给我顶了嘴，只剩下二人了。这样的脱离群众，还能进行工作吗？”五区南马巷支部组织委员行政命令很厉害，他开始未检讨，大家便向他展开批评，指出：积极完成任务是对的，打击群众是不对的。也叫他算一下真正跟着走的有几个人，他最后做了检讨而认识了脱离群众之危险。七区小支书在党内外严重的不民主，独断专行，谁给他提意见就打击谁，这次党员懂得了党的民主集中制。大家说：“俺从前不懂，所以也不敢批评你，你这脱离群众现象，你一个人把党的影响就闹坏了，这是不对的。”在大家的批评下，他初步的作了检讨。另外十二区三砦村，农会副主席怕整党，做群众尾巴，群众说落后话，他也说落后话，故意表现和党不团结。大家批评了这是严重的错误，党员应当时时刻刻提高群众的觉悟，不是迁就群众的落后，只有耐心的提高了群众的觉悟，真正为群众服务，才能真正的团结群众。——经过党内的批评与自我批评，解决了支部问题后，接着便树立党内的各种制度，如会议汇报批评等制度。
    这次训练中，区干部也同样的以无产阶级的尺度和标准来检查自己，这推动了全体党员的批评与自我批评，党员真正认识了党是民主集中制的，同时密切了上下级关系。一区区干部李意太经过上党课后，首先在李家庄支部会上检查了自己的宗派思想，引起支部的认真检讨。互区区委书记牛中山经过党史党章学习，在党员大会上作检查、并表明今后要艰苦奋斗，全心全意为群众服务，服从党的调动，过江过河都没意见，要耐心领导群众，为建设新民主主义社会而奋斗。区干的检讨，对党员有很大的启发与感动，县委也都作了适当的自我批评。
　　（五）学习党的政策树立政策思想。
    支部有些党员在贯彻党的政策时，执行很不自觉，往往从个人出发，而以为政策是专门束缚人的，不懂得政策是党根据广大人民的意志而制定的，没有正确的政策革命便不能成功。这次因为进行了党的无产阶级思想的教育，开始跳开农民个人的狭小圈子，所以学习党的政策时比较顺利，这次学习整党与结束土地改革的各种政策，认识了结束土地改革的目的性，从体会每一政策的精神中，又认识了政策的阶级性，认识了政策的重要。同时还具体的研究了每一政策，什么是左倾？什么是右倾？左右倾的危害是什么？因而初步的把执行政策变为自觉的行动。
