　　Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 14th: TASS reports: The German News Agency reports that people in various places are actively discussing the draft constitution, which was passed by the German People's Council on October 23 last year and submitted to the people of the whole country for discussion. The state of Thuringia has held 3,000 meetings, the state of Brandenburg has held 1,500 meetings, and the state of Saxony has held 1,200 meetings. The number of people participating in these meetings is approximately 900,000. The German People's Council has received 744 amendments and supplements to the draft constitution. The agency reported that the so-called Bonn "Constitution" was made in secret meetings by the leaders of West German political parties according to the orders of the military governor. Its purpose is to make the people of West Germany subordinate to the occupying authorities. However, Germany's democratic forces are formulating a progressive democratic constitution through open discussions. This constitution will guarantee the national interests of the German people and consolidate the anti-fascist democratic system.

  　以巩固反法西斯的民主制度
    【新华社陕北十四日电】塔斯社讯：德意志通讯社报导，各地人民纷纷讨论宪法草案，该宪草系去年十月二十三日由德国人民委员会通过而提交全国人民研讨。绍林吉亚省已举行了三千次集会，勃兰登堡省已举行了一千五百次集会，萨克森省已举行了一千二百次集会。参加这些会议的人数约九十万人。德国人民委员会收到了七百四十四份对宪法草案的修正案和补充案。该社报导，所谓波恩“宪法”，是西德政党魁首们按军事总督的命令，在秘密会议上制成的。其目的，在使西德人民臣属于占领国当局。但是，德国的民主力量，隙正经由公开讨论方式制定进步民主的宪法，这一宪法将保证德国人民的民族利益，巩固反法西斯的民主制度。
