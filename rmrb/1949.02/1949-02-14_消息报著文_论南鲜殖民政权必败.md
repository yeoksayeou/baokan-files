Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, February 12th:

　　"All the conspiracies and tricks of the American expansionists and their agents in South Korea are bound to fail completely." This is the conclusion of the Soviet "News" report after analyzing the situation in South Korea. The "News" article, titled "The Colonial Regime in South Korea," stated: South Korea's economy is already controlled by American capital. More than 30 percent of South Korean industrial enterprises are held by American companies. Mining, electrical equipment and automobile industries, and the "Korean Rubber" and "Busan Rubber" enterprises are entirely owned by American companies. Due to the efforts of American expansionists and their Korean accomplices, South Korea has been maintained with the typical features of a colonial economy. South Korea's annual steel production was 75,000 tons in 1944, but it decreased to 8,072 tons in 1947, and now it has been reduced to zero. The main sector of industry—the textile industry—has fallen into decay, and its output is almost less than one-sixth of the wartime level. South Korean imports are twice its exports. The rule of American monopoly capital in South Korea has created economic fragmentation. The number of unemployed people on the verge of starvation is increasing. The situation of employed people is not much better; in 1948, the rise in the prices of daily necessities exceeded the rate of wage increase by three and a half times. Agriculture, where the feudal system holds a dominant position, is also declining.
　　American reactionaries have a clear purpose in implementing colonial rule in South Korea, which is to turn South Korea into one of the outposts of American imperialism in Asia. The American occupation authorities are stepping up the arming of their "allies." The American military authorities have concluded a servile agreement with the Syngman Rhee "government," stipulating that some areas of South Korea will still be occupied by the American armed forces, and in these areas, the American military authorities will have priority and privileges. The United States continues to occupy South Korea and shows no signs of intending to withdraw troops. The Korean people must pay 10 million won per month for the American occupation.
　　However, the Korean people refuse to obey the American puppets. The movement against the Syngman Rhee puppet regime and its foreign protectors has reached such a scale that one-quarter of the territory of South Korea has been declared under martial law. Indignation against the reactionary Syngman Rhee regime is developing among an increasingly broad range of South Korean residents.

### 消息报著文　论南鲜殖民政权必败

  　论南鲜殖民政权必败
    【新华社陕北十二日电】“美国扩张主义者及其在南朝鲜代理人的一切阴谋诡计，一定要完全失败”，这是苏联消息报分析南朝鲜情势后的结论。消息报在题为“南朝鲜的殖民政权”的论文中称：南朝鲜的经济业已由美国资本控制。南朝鲜工业企业的百分之三十以上，都握在美国公司手中。采矿、电气装备与汽车工业、“朝鲜橡皮”与“釜山橡皮”企业，完全属于美国公司。由于美国扩张主义者与他们的朝鲜同谋者的努力，南朝鲜被保持着殖民经济的典型的面貌。南朝鲜钢的年产量，一九四四年为七万五千吨，一九四七年减至八千零七十二吨，目前则减至零了。工业的主要部门——纺织业——已陷于凋蔽，其产量几乎不及战时水平的六分之一。南朝鲜入口等于出口的两倍。美国独占资本在南朝鲜的统治，已造成经济上的支离破碎。濒于饥饿待毙的失业者人数正在增长中。就业者的情况也好不了多少，一九四八年，日用品价格的高涨，已超过工资增加速度的三倍半。封建制度强占统治地位的农业也在下降。
    美国反动派对南朝鲜实施殖民统治有一个明确的目的，就是将南朝鲜变为美帝国主义在亚洲的前哨阵地之一。美国占领当局正在加紧武装他们的“盟国”。美国军事当局已与李承晚“政府”缔结了奴役性的协定，即南朝鲜若干地区仍由美国武装部队占领，而在这些地区中，美国军事当局将获有优先权与特权。美国仍继续占领南朝鲜，并无迹象表示打算撤兵。朝鲜人民对美国占领费每月必须付出一千万圆。
    但是，朝鲜人民拒绝服从美国傀儡。反李承晚傀儡政权及其外国保护人的运动，已达到这种规模，即南朝鲜四分之一的领土，已宣布了戒严令。对反动的李承晚政权的义愤，正在越来越广泛的南朝鲜居民中发展着。
