　　Intensify Spring Ploughing Preparations Step by Step
  　When the Ground is Frozen and the Cattle are Idle, it's a Good Time to Deliver Manure
    The Liberated Peasants of Central and Southern Hebei are Happily Engaging in Production
    [Jinan News] After the Administrative Office issued spring plowing instructions, village cadres and Party members in Qinghe County actively publicized them to the masses, calling on them to take advantage of the frozen ground and idle cattle to quickly complete the manure delivery for spring plowing, and villages across the region launched a manure delivery upsurge. In the Jiejiazhuang area, manure-carrying carts came and went incessantly. Livestock-owning households and non-livestock-owning households voluntarily combined to form mutual aid groups to deliver all the manure to the fields. The liberated peasants encouraged each other with joyful voices: "The front is winning battles, and the rear is producing more." On the 10th of this month, Guo Limiao village cadres in the Fifth District held a mass meeting to call for manure delivery, so that they could plow and harrow the land after the thaw. After the meeting, the masses formed many manure delivery mutual aid groups and began delivering manure the next day. Some were scooping manure from the pens, and others were pulling it to the fields, very busy. Yu Yulan, a liberated household, said happily: "After liberation, we have cattle, land, and furniture. This year, we can have a good production!" Li Fazhang, a new middle peasant, not only delivered all the manure but also actively transformed alkaline land, striving to produce good seedlings this year.
    [Jizhong News] In Nan Shan Village, Raoyang County, a poor peasant, after receiving his land certificate, paid special attention to accumulating fertilizer, picking up manure early every day. The masses gave him the nickname "Locomotive." Wu Qingtian, a newly promoted middle peasant in Xiao Wu Pan Village, was reluctant to watch the New Year's opera and started delivering manure on the second day of the Lunar New Year. When asked why he was so active, he said, "We are liberated, and our enthusiasm for work is great! Besides, delivering it early will not delay supporting the front if they need vehicles." Many villages, such as Wanggang, Ximan, and Nanshan in Raoyang, started delivering manure on the third or fourth day of the Lunar New Year. In Kong Jundao Village, Ninth District, many people had already mashed the manure by the end of the old lunar year. By the seventh day of the Lunar New Year, there were already twenty or so wheat fields around the village with manure spread on them. Liu Zhenlin, a new middle peasant in the village, was afraid of the dryness of the spring land, so on the 28th of the twelfth lunar month, he used a sulfur roller to roll the wheat field once, and on the eighth day of the New Year, he hauled four carts of manure.
    [Another News] In Qing County's Second District, many farmers were mashing and delivering manure as early as the second day of the Lunar New Year. West Aixinzhuang is a small poor village. The whole village only had one broken cart, so Ma Yunran and Ren Yuming and five other households borrowed three large carts from Wuzhao Village, more than ten miles away, and borrowed another cart from Damuqiao to deliver manure. Thanks to the village's urgent efforts, twenty households out of the village's eighty-three households had finished delivering manure by the sixth day of the Lunar New Year. In the villages of Qianhou Niujuan, Cao Temple, Shuanglouzi, and five other villages, by the seventh day of the Lunar New Year, fifty percent of the villages had finished mashing the first batch of manure and were delivering it to the fields.
    [Another News] In the manure delivery upsurge, many villages paid attention to taking care of the production of revolutionary martyrs' families and military dependents. In West Aizhuang, Qing County, eight military families participated in four mutual aid groups to help deliver manure. In Hou Niujuan Village, since Zhou Erying's and Bingxiang's families had no labor, the village mobilized people to mash and deliver manure for them first. In Yangzhuang Village, Anguo, fifty peasant households found ways to solve the fertilizer accumulation, manure delivery, and production difficulties of three martyrs' families and five military families.
    [Another News] Xu Wenxing of Jiang Gaoguan Village, Jianguo County, has picked up twenty carts of manure from November of last year to now. Jiang Zhenhai is seventy-eight years old, but he has picked up six carts of manure. He said to his son, "Don't think I'm old, my heart is not old!" Jiang Zengshun, a liberated household, said: "I won't divide the land anymore. I will pick up manure every day and cultivate my 2.7 mu of land well." Xie Lintian in West Gaoguan Village started mashing manure on the second day of the Lunar New Year and delivered it to the fields on the fourth day. According to incomplete statistics from seventeen villages in the district, fifty-one households started mashing manure from the second or third day of the Lunar New Year, and thirty-six households were delivering manure.

    冀中冀南翻身农民欢快闹生产
    【冀南讯】自行署春耕指示下达后，清河县各村干部、党员积极向群众宣传，号召趁地冻牛闲，迅速完成春耕送粪，各村遂展开了送粪热潮。全区解家庄送粪的大车来往不断，全村牲口户及不喂牲口户在自愿结合下，组成互助，把粪全部送到地里，翻身后的农民以愉快的口吻相互鼓励着：“前方打胜仗，后方多生产”。五区郭李庙村干于本月十日召开群众大会，号召送粪，等到解冻后就耕耙地，会后群众结合了许多送粪互助组，第二天就开始了送粪，有的出圈挑粪，有的向地里拉，十分忙碌。翻身户于玉兰高兴的说：“翻身后有牛有地有家具了，今年能够好好生产啦！”新中农李发章，不仅把粪送完，还积极改造碱地，争取今年出好苗。
    【冀中讯】饶阳县南善村一个贫农领了土地证后，特别重视积肥，天天起早拾粪，群众给他送了个外号叫“火车头”。小吴潘村新升中农吴庆田，舍不得看年戏，大年初二就开始送粪。别人问他为啥这样积极，他说：“翻身啦，干活的心劲大啦！再说，早些送出去，一旦前方用车也误不了支援前线。”饶阳王岗、西满、南善等很多村都是初三初四开始了送粪。九区孔君道村旧历年底，就有很多人把粪捣完，正月初七村周围已有二十多块麦地，拉上了粪。该村新中农刘振林怕春天地干，旧历腊月二十八就用硫＠把麦地轧了一遍，过年初八便拉上了四车粪。
    【又讯】青县二区大年初二就有很多农民捣粪送粪。西艾辛庄，是个小穷村，全村只有一辆破车，马云然和任玉明等五户，就到十里以外的吴召村借了三辆大车，又到大木桥去借了一辆车来送粪。全村八十三户人家，由于村里抓得紧，到初六就有二十户把粪送完。前后牛圈头村、曹寺、双楼子等八个村，到旧历正月初七就有百分之五十的村捣完头遍，正往地里送。
    【又讯】在送粪热潮中，许多村注意照顾烈军属的生产。青县西艾庄，八家军属参加在四个互助组里，互助送粪。后牛圈头村周而英和丙祥家没劳动力，村中就动员人先给他们捣粪送粪。安国杨庄五十户农民，设法解决了三户烈属、五户军属的积肥送粪和生产困难。
    【又讯】建国县蒋高官村徐文兴，从去年十一月到现在已拾粪二十车。蒋振海七十八岁了，还拾粪六车，他对儿子说：“别看我人老，心不老啊！”翻身户蒋增顺说：“我不再分地了，我要天天拾粪，把我这二亩七分地种好。”西高官村解林田，大年（旧历年）初二开始捣粪，初四就送到了地里。据该区十七个村不完全的统计，从初二、三就开始捣粪的有五十一户，送粪的三十六户。
