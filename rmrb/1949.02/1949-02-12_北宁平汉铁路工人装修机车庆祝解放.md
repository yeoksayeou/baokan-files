Xinhua News Agency, Beiping, 10th—Workers of the Beining and Pinghan Railways are celebrating their liberation and expressing the solidarity and friendship of the working class by mutually gifting locomotives and renovating locomotives and trains. Several locomotives such as the "Beiping," "Tianjin," "Tianjin Liberation," "New Tangshan," and Changxindian's "Victory" have already emerged. As early as New Year's Day this year, two "New Tangshan" locomotives, meticulously inspected and repaired (甲检即详细检查修理, 过去一般六个月才甲检一次 - a detailed inspection and repair, formerly only done about every six months) by employees of the Tangshan Railway Locomotive Factory, were running on the Beining Railway. On February 1st, the "Tianjin Liberation" locomotive, meticulously inspected and repaired by employees of the East Station Locomotive Depot of the Tianjin Military Control Commission's Railway Department, officially began operation. After the liberation of Tianjin, the depot's employees planned to celebrate liberation by increasing production. Therefore, they decided to meticulously inspect and repair a locomotive and name it "Tianjin Liberation." This project commenced on January 23rd. Initially, the depot had no electricity or water, the crane could not turn, and the locomotive could not be lifted, so they could only do some cleaning of grease. Two days later, the electricity came, and forty-three workers worked hard, continuing until the afternoon of Lunar New Year's Eve. The workers unanimously said, "We won't celebrate the New Year until it's finished!" As a result, it was completed that night. During the meticulous inspection and repair process, the employees greatly demonstrated creativity, fully utilizing old materials and overcoming various technical difficulties, thus saving 70% of the cost compared to the Kuomintang era. To congratulate the Tianjin railway workers on their liberation, the Shenyang railway workers specially gifted the Tianjin Military Control Commission's Railway Department a "Tianjin" locomotive. This locomotive was an old one that could not be used under Kuomintang rule, and it was repaired by the workers after the liberation of Shenyang. The locomotive arrived at Tianjin North Station on February 3rd. Prior to this, to welcome the liberation of Beiping, the "Beiping" locomotive repaired by the workers of the Shenyang Huangguantun Railway Factory entered Guannei (the area south of the Shanhaiguan Pass) on January 20th. After the liberation of Beiping, more than 1,400 railway workers from Changxindian rode their own "Victory" People's Train, which they had long prepared, into Beiping on February 3rd to participate in the People's Liberation Army's entry ceremony. They began decorating this train in late December last year. The locomotive was adorned with a giant painted image of the people's leader, Chairman Mao Zedong, and the sides of the train were decorated with large red characters reading "Celebrate Liberation" and "People's Railway," which were very magnificent. As the train passed through Fengtai and the suburbs of Beiping, residents on both sides came out to watch and frantically cheered to the workers, "Long live the workers!" "Long live liberation!"

Xinhua News Agency, Tianjin, 10th—The "Tianjin" locomotive, gifted by Shenyang railway workers to the Tianjin Military Control Commission's Railway Department, has arrived in Tianjin. At 1:15 PM on the afternoon of the 3rd, this newly painted locomotive, accompanied by the "Tianjin Liberation" locomotive, arrived at North Station (Main Station) from East Station. The workers of the Railway Department of the Military Control Commission swarmed to the train, cheering and paying their respects to the brothers from Shenyang. The sides of the "Tianjin" locomotive were inlaid with two lines of gold characters reading "Wherever the People's Army fights, we will drive the train there," which was extremely magnificent and beautiful. The locomotive was driven from Shenyang by Yang Jingtang, military representative of the locomotive section of the Shenyang Railway Bureau, Zheng Haishan, supervisor, Yu Youzhou, driver, Wang Baochun, fireman, and Li Dequan, stoker, along with ten others. Yang Cheng, representative of the Tianjin Railway Department Employee Work Group, represented the Railway Department and the employees to welcome them. They then formed a procession, led by a band, to the Ningyuan Auditorium for a formal welcome ceremony. At the welcome ceremony, Chairman Yang Cheng delivered a speech first. He first thanked the Shenyang railway workers who made the "Tianjin" locomotive, and said, "This demonstrates the great friendship and unity of the working class, and this spirit is worthy of our learning. Recently, Beiping was liberated, and national victory will come soon. Our Tianjin worker comrades must also manufacture 'Nanjing' and 'Guangzhou' and send them to the South." The chairman then read two letters from the Shenyang Railway Bureau congratulating the Tianjin railway workers on their liberation and encouraging each other. After reading, Yang Jingtang, military representative of the locomotive section of the Shenyang Railway Bureau, delivered a speech. He said, "Today's gathering is what everyone has strived for through more than 20 years of hard work. This locomotive was an old locomotive that could not be used under Kuomintang rule, and it was repaired by worker comrades after the liberation of Shenyang. We originally planned to send it after the liberation of Tianjin, but liberation here came unexpectedly quickly." Then, Tang Shaochen and Cui Fengshan, worker representatives of the Tianjin Locomotive Depot, delivered reply speeches successively, expressing that they would not only learn from the Shenyang railway worker comrades, but also drive Tianjin's locomotives to the railways throughout the country. Later, Guo Weicheng, director of the Railway Department, spoke, saying, "Under the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party, the workers must be united, and this locomotive is a symbol." He called on the railway workers to strengthen their work and complete the railway transportation tasks. Finally, the Railway Department propaganda team performed songs, drums, and other recreational programs. The conference ended at four o'clock.

　　北宁平汉铁路工人装修机车庆祝解放
    【新华社北平十日电】北宁铁路和平汉铁路的工人们用相互赠送机车和装修机车列车来庆祝自己的解放和表示工人阶级的团结友爱，目前已出现的有“北平号”、“天津号”、“天津解放号”、“新唐山号”，和长辛店的“胜利号”等多辆。早在今年元旦，唐山铁路机车厂职工甲检（甲检即详细检查修理，过去一般六个月才甲检一次）的两台“新唐山号”机车即在北宁路上开行。本月一日，天津军管会铁道处东站机务段员工们甲检的“天津解放号”机车又正式开驶。天津解放后，该段员工们就计划以增加生产来庆祝解放。因此决定甲检一台车，命名为“天津解放号”。此项工程于上月二十三日动工，开始段上没电没水，起重机转不动，机车没法吊起来，只好做一些擦洗油垢的工作。两天后，电来了，四十三个工人就加油工作，一直到旧历除夕下午还在赶工，工人异口同声地说：“完不了，不过年！”结果当晚全部完工。在甲检过程中员工们曾大大地发挥了创造性，充分利用旧材料，克服技术上的种种困难，因而所用成本比国民党时代节省了百分之七十。为了祝贺天津铁路工人的解放，沈阳铁路工人特赠送津市军管会铁道处一台“天津号”机车。这台机车原是国民党统治下不能使用的旧机车，由工人们在沈阳解放后修复起来的。该车已于本月三日驶抵天津北站。在这以前，为了迎接北平解放，沈阳皇姑屯铁路工厂工人修复的“北平号”机车即于上月二十日开入关内。北平解放后，长辛店铁路职工一千四百余乘着他们自己早已准备好了的“胜利号”人民列车于本月三日开入北平，参加人民解放军的入城仪式。这列车是他们在去年十二月下旬就开始装修的。机车饰有人民领袖毛泽东主席的油漆巨像，列车两旁装饰了“庆祝解放”、“人民铁路”的斗大红字，十分壮丽。车过丰台和北平城郊，两旁居民都出来观看，并发狂似的向工人欢呼：“工人万岁！”“解放万岁！”
    【新华社天津十日电】沈阳铁路工人赠与津市军管会铁道处之“天津号”机车抵津。三日下午一时十五分，这辆油漆得崭新的机车，由“天津解放号”陪同自东站驶抵北站（总站）时，军管会铁道处的工人即蜂拥到车旁，向从沈阳来的弟兄欢呼致敬。“天津号”的车身两旁镶着“人民军队打到那里，我们把火车开到那里”两行金字，极其雄壮美观。该车由沈阳铁路局机务段军事代表杨景堂、监工员郑海山、司机于游州、司炉王宝春、炉夫李德权等十人自沈阳驶来。津市铁道处职工工作组杨诚代表铁道处和职工们一同前往欢迎，旋即列队以乐队为前导，赴宁园礼堂举行正式的欢迎会。在欢迎会上，首由主席杨诚致词，他首先向制作“天津号”的沈阳铁路职工致谢，并说：“这表现了工人阶级的伟大的友爱和团结，这种精神值得我们学习。最近北平解放，全国胜利就会很快到来，我们天津的工人同志也要制造‘南京号’、‘广州号’送到南方去。”继由主席宣读沈阳铁路局给天津铁路工人祝贺解放并互勉的两封信。读毕，由沈阳铁路局机务段军事代表杨景堂致词，他说：“今天的聚会是大家廿多年艰苦奋斗争取来的，这辆机车是在国民党统治下不能使用的旧机车，在沈阳解放后由工人同志把它修复起来。本来打算在天津解放后就送来，但这里解放得出乎意料的快。”继由天津机务段工人代表唐绍臣、崔凤山先后致答词，他们表示不但要向沈阳铁路工人同志看齐，并且要将天津的机车开到全国的铁路上去。后由铁道处长郭维城同志讲话，他说：“在中国共产党的领导下，工人一定是团结的，这辆机车就是一个象征。”他号召铁路工人加强工作，完成铁道运输任务。最后由铁道处宣传队表演歌咏、大鼓等游艺节目，大会至四时始散。
