[Report from this newspaper] The Wuxiang County Government convened a meeting of production cadres on the 5th of this month to study how to summarize and conclude winter production, transitioning to preparations for spring ploughing, laying a solid foundation for spring ploughing, so as to smoothly carry out this year's large-scale production campaign. It also put forward the following specific tasks: 1. Preparations before spring ploughing: (1) Inspect and promote firewood gathering and coal stockpiling, ensuring at least eight months' worth of fuel is prepared. (2) Each household must complete the winter production task of increasing fertilizer by fifty dan, seizing the opportunity in the first month of the lunar year to deliver manure and mill flour, and fully shift to sowing when spring ploughing begins. (3) Begin preparing to repair field edges and build embankments, completely repairing collapsed land before sowing. (4) Mobilize and organize the masses to repair and purchase agricultural implements, avoiding impact on production due to a lack of livestock and agricultural implements. (5) Inspect the use of loans and correct the tendency of misusing loans. (6) Cooperatives should actively assist the masses in spring ploughing preparations during this stage, resolving various difficulties of the masses in spring ploughing (such as buying draught animals and repairing agricultural implements, etc.). (7) Understand and investigate the quantity of tree saplings in various places, preparing to regulate and carry out the spring tree planting campaign. (8) Launch a fifty-day spring spinning campaign, requiring each household's women to provide enough single-layer clothing for the whole family's spring use through spring spinning. 2. Specific methods: (1) From the 7th to the 23rd, half a month will be designated for summarizing winter production, and strive to complete spring ploughing preparations before March 20th. Mobilize for spring ploughing after the spring equinox and before the Qingming Festival, in order to begin sowing. (2) Quickly summarize winter production, and arrange spring production work through summarization. Shift from key summaries to general summaries, from villages to districts, with the focus on villages that have completed land reform and Category II villages with a good work foundation. (3) In terms of manpower allocation, in addition to the district's leading production cadres, cadres from the county participating in production work will be assigned to various places to help carry out the work, focusing on key areas. (4) The county, districts, and villages will systematically organize blacksmiths and carpenters to establish agricultural implement stations or blacksmith shops to repair agricultural implements. (5) Immediately repair roads and bridges, mobilizing the masses to complete coal hauling and transportation. (6) Appropriately plan time to solve the difficulties of livestock and agricultural implements with emphasis. (7) Estimate and collect tree saplings, and delineate river beach areas for tree planting.
