　　TAIHANG TELEGRAM: The Taihang Trading Area Company convened a meeting of managers from its affiliated general stores on the 11th of last month to discuss specific plans for implementing the 1949 economic guidelines and policies, as well as relations with cooperatives. After ten days of enthusiastic discussion, a summary was finally made. The summary pointed out the achievements of 1948. Firstly, in terms of supply and sales, the annual operation of local products exceeded that of 1947 by 47%, and it supplied 62% of the salt consumed by the people of the entire region. In terms of supporting the war: it supplied the army and the people in the war zone with necessities for life; stabilized commodity prices in the war zone; and realized the leading role of operation. Therefore, prices last year basically rose steadily. Last year, it absorbed more than 5.6 million catties of handicrafts (bamboo products, mats, etc.) and more than 7.6 million catties of production raw materials (cotton, etc.) from the masses, accounting for 7.12% of the total trade volume, and organized a large number of mountain products to the new liberated areas. It helped the masses in supply and marketing, carried out material adjustments, weakened seasonal differences, reduced the intermediate exploitation of private merchants, and guaranteed the income of small producers. The summary believes that many principled problems have arisen and exist in the work. First, there was wavering in the implementation of the Party's trade policy. The purpose of supporting production, i.e., what to support? How to support? The guiding ideology was unclear. In January and February of last year, high prices were used to purchase bad cloth, claiming to be to take care of "poor peasants", and even small merchants in the city were regarded as "poor hired laborers," which affected the improvement of production. After the correction, the struggle against speculative merchants was relaxed again. Some private merchants in the Second District bought our salt, and after five or six days, they asked us to increase the price of salt. Not only did we not resolutely fight against them, but we followed them, losing the leading role of the state-owned trade economy. The relationship with the cooperative was also abnormal, and there were still views of utilization and one-sided granting, which were reflected in the specific business relationship as "recruiting when needed, waving away when not needed" and "coming together when suitable, leaving when not suitable". Second, there was a serious existence of empiricism and bureaucratism. Leaders at all levels did not study the reports from below enough, and there were no systematic, clear and timely instructions. They failed to operate the state-owned trade economy better, so as to lead the market and fight against speculative private merchants. Instead, there was a phenomenon of relying on big brands and a lot of capital. Third, the operation reflected only looking at immediate profits, not starting from leading the overall economy, not knowing how to use state funds, and not conducting thorough investigations and studies on the market's supply capacity and demand conditions, and the basic situation of price changes, blindly following the market's rise or fall. These problems urgently need to be resolved. Regarding the future direction and practices, the summary proposed: According to the general guidelines and combining with the specific situation of our region, the basic tasks for 1949 are: to organize and develop material exchanges, and to support and transform cooperatives. To stabilize prices, to provide the masses with production and living materials in a planned way, to promote the sales of production products, to organize thousands of small producers, to develop production and prosper the economy. Private capitalism should be developed under the leadership and control of the state economy, and operate properly in a way that is beneficial to the people's livelihood. Speculative and monopolistic behaviors will be resolutely cracked down on, so as to realize the leading role of the new democratic state-owned trade economy. In the future, we must use the urban economy to guide the development of the rural economy and maintain the leadership of the proletariat. This requires us to be vigilant against our decentralized, unplanned capitalist operating methods and promote planned and organized centralized operating methods. Because in the past, we did not correctly grasp the state-owned trade policy, and indulged some private merchants in speculating and disrupting the market. In the future, the trade system must be centralized and unified, and leadership must be strengthened, playing a leading role in all economic sectors of the new democracy. Otherwise, the strength will be offset, which will be detrimental to the national economy. Regarding the relationship between state-owned trading companies and cooperatives, the meeting stipulated the following: 1. It must be clear that helping cooperatives by state-owned trade is one of the basic tasks, but it must be cooperatives that are connected with the masses and have the correct business direction. 2. Under the principle of taking into account both public and private interests, business relations should be established on the basis of agency purchase, agency sale, ordering, ordering goods, and signing contracts. Credit should be emphasized, and each transaction must be clear. State-owned stores should give priority to cooperatives, but cooperatives must abide by the contract and its obligations. The summary finally pointed out: In order to ensure the implementation of the above guidelines, the following specific work must be paid attention to in 1949: 1. Strengthen centralized management, obey unified material mobilization, and within a certain period of time, a certain commodity must be unified in mobilization, unified promotion and distribution. Only in this way can we combat speculative private merchants. 2. Occupational relations: The state-owned economy must be well resolved, and a unified production and sales plan must be formulated starting from unity. 3. The use of funds: attention should be paid to frequent turnover, and they should be used in a focused and planned manner. 4. Material management: the idea of "emphasizing finance over materials" must be overcome, and they must be properly kept. 5. Actively establish close contacts with various state-owned enterprises (such as banks, transportation bureaus, etc.). This will have a great effect on developing production and stabilizing prices. 6. Overcome blind operation, strengthen investigation and research, carefully and meticulously investigate the market price throughput relationship and the requirements of the masses, make plans, and conduct them with emphasis.

　　实行集中管理加强统一领导
    太行贸易公司召开经理会议
    【太行电】太行贸易区公司于上月十一日召开所属总店经理会议，讨论贯彻一九四九年经济方针、政策的具体计划，与合作社关系等问题。经十天的热烈讨论，最后做出总结。总结中指出一九四八年的成绩，首先在供销方面，全年经营土产规模超过一九四七年百分之四十七，供给全区人民食盐量的百分之六十二。支援战争方面：供给了军队与战地群众生活上的必需品；平稳了战地物价；实现了经营的领导作用。因此，去年物价基本上是平稳上升的；去年一年中，吸收了群众的手工业成品（竹货、席子等）五百六十余万斤，生产原料（棉花等）七百六十余万斤，占总贸易额百分之七点一二，并大量组织山货到新区去。帮助群众供销，进行物资调剂，削弱了季节性差额，减轻了私商的中间剥削，保证了小生产者的收益。总结认为：工作中曾产生了与存在着不少带有原则性的问题。第一、在执行党的贸易政策上是左右摇摆的，对扶持生产的目的，即扶持什么？怎样扶持？指导思想上是不明确的。去年一、二月份，用高价收坏布，还说是为了照顾“贫农”把城市的小商人都当作“贫雇”，致影响了生产的提高。纠偏后，又放松了对投机商人的斗争。二分区曾有些私商，买了我们盐，过了五、六天又向我们提出要提高盐价，我们非但没坚决进行斗争，反跟着他们跑，失掉了国营贸易经济的领导作用。和合作社关系也不正常，仍存在着利用观点与片面的恩赐观点，表现在具体业务关系上是“用着招来，不用则挥去”与“合则来，不合则去”的态度。第二、严重的存在着经验主义、官僚主义。各级领导对下面的报告研究不够，也没有系统明确及时的指示，没有把国营贸易经济经营的更好，从而去领导市场，和投机私商进行斗争；而有凭牌子大，本钱多的现象。第三、经营上反映出只看眼前利润，没从领导全盘经济出发，不会使用国家资金，不夫周密调查研究市场供给能力与需要状况及物价变动的基本情况，盲目的跟着市场上涨或下跌。这些问题急待解决。关于今后的方针与做法，总结提出：根据总的方针结合我区具体情况，一九四九年的基本任务是：组织与发展物资交流，扶持改造合作社。平稳物价，做到有计划的供给群众生产与生活资料，推销生产成品，将千万小生产者组织起来，发展生产繁荣经济。要使私人资本主义在国家经济的领导下，控制下，发展有利于国民生计的正当经营。对于投机垄断行为则是坚决打击，以实现新民主主义国营贸易经济的领导作用。今后要以城市经济指导乡村经济发展，保持无产阶级领导。这就必须警惕我们分散的、无计划的资本主义经营方法，发扬有计划、有组织的集中经营方法。由于过去没有正确的掌握国营贸易政策，纵容了某些私商投机取巧，捣乱市场。今后贸易系统必须集中统一，加强领导，在新民主主义一切经济中起领导作用。否则，即会力量抵消，对国家经济是有损害的。关于国营贸易公司与合作社的关系会议中有如下规定：一、要明确国营贸易扶助合作社是基本任务之一，但必须是联系群众与业务方向正确的合作社。二、在公私兼顾两利原则下，业务关系上建立代买、代卖、订购、定货、订立合同，要讲信用，必须是一事一清。国营商店要给合作社优先权，但合作社必须遵守合同及其义务。总结最后指出：为保证以上方针的贯彻，在一九四九年必须注意以下具体工作：一、加强集中管理，服从统一物资调动，在一定的时期内，某种商品要统一调动，统一推销分配，只有这样才能打击投机私商。二、职业关系问题，国营经济要很好的解决，要从统一出发，订立统一生产与推销计划。三、资金使用，要注意经常周转，有重点有计划的运用。四、物资管理，要克服“轻物资、重财政”的思想，要好好保管。五、主动与各国营企业（如银行、交通局等）取得密切联系。这对发展生产，平稳物价有极大作用。六、克服盲目经营，加强调查研究，细心、点滴、认真调查各市场物价吞吐关系与群众要求，做出计划，有重点的进行。
