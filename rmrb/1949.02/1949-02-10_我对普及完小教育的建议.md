　　My Suggestions for Popularizing Complete Primary Education
　　Jingxian Education Section Chang Qingguang Shi Jingtang
　　In recent years, due to the land reform in rural areas, the broad masses have been emancipated, and a large number of school-age children are demanding to go to school and advance to higher levels. However, due to difficulties such as funding and teachers, the development of schools in various places cannot yet meet the needs of the masses. In particular, there are too few higher primary schools, which prevents many junior primary school graduates from having the opportunity to continue their education. Taking Jing County as an example, there are currently about five thousand fourth-grade junior primary school students, all of whom should be promoted to senior primary this year. However, there are too few existing senior primary schools and complete primary schools to solve this problem, and the vast majority of them are unwilling to drop out of school. If we do not find a way to accommodate them, they will only continue to review the old lessons of junior primary school or drop out of school. If every year each county delays the promotion of five thousand children, the entire liberated area will delay the future of tens of millions of children. This is a problem that deserves attention.
　　In order to solve this problem, we have explored temporary methods for popularizing higher primary education in the past six months. Last autumn, when dispersing complete primary schools, Jing County divided the original eight complete primary schools into twenty-three, and added the Normal School High School, reaching twenty-four. At that time, due to the shortage of local grain and the regulations of the administrative office, and the improvement of the supply system, funding became a problem. Therefore, we made an experimental decision to divide the twenty-four complete primary schools into two categories: twelve would still be run according to the regular system, and the other twelve would mainly enroll day students within two and a half kilometers, and cancel the expenses of cooks, etc., called popularization classes.
　　These popularization classes only have one teacher, and the principal is concurrently held by the principal of the central primary school. In addition to the supply of one teacher, each student is only given three catties of rice for daily expenses (in fact, three-quarters of this can be saved). Since its establishment, many students have been attending school, with more than fifty students in each class. Due to the strengthening of cultural learning, the academic performance of some is no worse than that of regular higher primary schools.
　　In particular, the saving of funds, taking the Normal School High School as an example, there are two classes of students with a total of one hundred and thirty-seven people, using four teachers and four handyman (a total of fourteen with the normal school) and one grinding donkey (one mule and one donkey in total with the normal school). The monthly recurring expenditure is 2,794 catties of grain. If these two classes were to run popularization classes with this expenditure, each class would have one person with a monthly salary of 170 catties and an office fee of 40 catties, which could run thirteen and a half classes. Even if only one and a half teachers are counted (using junior primary school teachers or central principals to concurrently teach part of the courses), ten classes can be run.
　　This means that the expenditure of a regular class is equivalent to five to seven times that of a popularization class. This means that using the existing expenditure of twelve regular complete primary schools to run popularization classes can run sixty to eighty-four classes, greatly helping children's opportunities to advance to higher levels.
　　Another urgent problem to be solved in our rural areas is the combined teaching in rural areas. For example, in densely populated areas of Jing County, there is a village every one or two kilometers. As long as there are enough thirty or so students in each village, a school is set up in each village, implementing combined teaching for several grades. Even if the teachers use all their efforts, they cannot teach well. Even if the teachers have advanced teaching abilities, they cannot add advanced classes. In order to further popularize higher primary education, we plan to organize joint schools. Taking one village as the center, we will organize the schools in the three or so villages within a radius of two kilometers around it into a joint school. In this way, with more teachers and more students, classes can be divided by grade. Even if combined teaching is adopted, the grades in the combined classes can be reduced. For example, grades 1, 2, and 3 can use three groups of combined teaching, grades 4 and 5 can use two grades of combined teaching, and grade 6 can use single-grade teaching. If there are many students in grades 1, 2, and 3, they can each stay in their original villages. Grades 4 and 5 can be concentrated in a small area of villages, and grade 6 can be concentrated in a large area of villages. In addition, we can also adopt the methods of "individual schooling" and "grade exchange." For example, if there are fewer than five students in a grade in Village A, that grade can be canceled, and individuals can be mobilized to attend the same grade in another neighboring village. The same is true for Village B and Village C. Or, if the number of students in the same grade in two neighboring villages, Village A and Village B, is not large, then grades can be exchanged for teaching, merging one or two grades from Village A into Village B, and merging one or two grades from Village B into Village A. This not only solves the problem of popularizing complete primary schools, but also allows the strengths and weaknesses of teachers' abilities to be used, and teaching efficiency will also be improved.
　　Of course, this simple approach is not our ideal, but a temporary popularization method under today's limitations of manpower and resources. This method must be tested on a small scale before it can be widely implemented. And difficulties and even temporary failures will inevitably be encountered in the experiment. But we believe that it will definitely be successful within a year at most.

### 我对普及完小教育的建议

　　我对普及完小教育的建议
    景县教育科常庆光史景汤
    近几年来由于农村的土地改革，广大群众都已翻身、广大的学龄儿童都要求上学、升学。但由于经费师资等困难，各地学校的发展，还不能满足群众的要求，特别高小办的太少，使许多初小毕业的学生，得不到继续升学的机会。就景县而论，现有初小四年级学生五千人左右，今年都应该升高级。但是现有的高小完小都少，不能解决这个问题，而他们绝大多数也不愿就此退学。我们如不想法收容，他们就只有仍然温习初小旧课，或是停学。如果每年每县都贻误五千个儿童升学，全解放区就会贻误几千万个儿童的前途。这是一个值得注意的问题。
    为了解决这一问题，半年来我们曾摸索出普及高小教育的临时办法。在去秋分散完小的时候，景县将原有八个完小分成二十三个完小，又添上师范附高，达到了二十四个。当时由于地方粮的不足，与行署规定的编制，与供给制度之提高，使经费成了问题。于是我们就做了试验性的决定，把二十四个完小分成两类，以十二个仍按正规制度办理，另外十二个，则只以招收五里半以内的通校生为主，取消了炊事员等费用的开支，叫普及班。
    这种普及班只设教员一人，校长由中心小学校长兼任，除一个教员的供给外，只照发了每个学生三斤米的经常费（其实这也是可以省下四分之三的）。自从设立以后，学生上学的很多，每班学生都在五十人以上。由于文化学习的加强，学习成绩，有的并不比正规高小坏。
    特别是经费的节省，以师范附高为例，学生两班共一百三十七人，用教员四人，勤杂四人（与师范合计共十四人）磨驴一头（与师范合计共骡一驴一），每月经常开支粮二千七百九十四斤，如以此两班开支去办普及班，每班一人月薪一百七十斤，办公费四十斤，可办十三个半班。即以一个半教员计（以初小教员或中心校长兼任功课一部）也可办十个班。
    这就说正规班的开支，相当普及班的五倍到七倍。这就是说拿现有的十二个正规完小的开支去办普及班，可以办六十个到八十四个，大大帮助了儿童升学的机会。
    我们农村中还有一种亟需解决的，是农村里的复式教学，如景县有的村庄较密的地区，一二里地一村，只要一村够三十来个学生就各设一学校，实行几个年级的复式教学，教员用尽九牛二虎之力也教不好，教员有高级教学的能力，也无法添设高级班。我们为进一步普及高小教育，计划组织联立学校，以一个村子为中心，把周围二里半径以内的三几个村的学校组织起来变成一个联立学校，这样教员多，学生多，就可按年级分班上课，即采用复式教学也可减少合班的年级，如一、二、三年级用三组复式教学，四、五年级用两级复式教学，六年级用单式教学，一、二、三年级学生多，可各在原村，四、五年级可以一小片村庄集中，六年级大片村庄集中，另外还可采用“个别就学”和“年级交换”的办法。如甲村有个年级不满五人，就可取消一级，个别动员到另一邻村的同年级上学，乙村丙村亦如此。或者甲、乙两个相近村庄两个同年级的学生人数都不多，那就可以交换年级教学，把甲村的一个或两个年级并到乙村，把乙村一个或两个年级的并到甲村。这样不仅解决了完小的普及问题，而教员能力的强弱也各得其用，教学效率也会提高。
    当然这种简陋的做法，并不是我们的理想，而是在今天的人力物力的限制下是一种临时的普及的办法。这种办法，必须经过小范围的试验，然后才能普遍的做。而在试验中也必然遇到困难，甚至暂时的失败。但是我们相信，最多用上一年的时间，一定能试验成功。
