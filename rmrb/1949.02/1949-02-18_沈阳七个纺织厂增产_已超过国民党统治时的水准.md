Xinhua News Agency, Shenyang, 13th—The production efficiency of seven factories under the Northeast Textile Administration, including Shenyang Textile Factory, Shenyang Branch of Liaoyang Textile Factory, Sujiatun Textile Factory south of Shenyang, and Shenyang Dyeing and Weaving Factory, has exceeded the level during the Kuomintang rule. These seven factories resumed work successively within ten days of being taken over in early November last year. According to November statistics: an average of more than 17,700 spindles were turning daily, producing a total of 849 bales of yarn (400 pounds per bale) by the end of the month. Although each spindle operated one hour less per day than during the Kuomintang rule, production increased by 0.04 pounds. In terms of quality, the monthly average yarn count produced during the Kuomintang rule was 14.7 counts, now averaging 17.3 counts. In December, 250 looms were operating, 96 fewer than during the Kuomintang rule, but the total cloth production increased by 40 percent compared to the past, totaling 7,632 bolts of cloth. The main reasons for the rapid increase in production in each factory are: (1) The production tasks of each factory were quickly determined, stabilizing the production order. The Textile Administration gave specific production tasks to each factory in the second half of November, after the factories started work in the first half of the month, enabling personnel in all departments to shift to production and quickly eliminate some of the chaos that occurred at the beginning of the liberation. (2) The problems of disunity between technicians, staff, and workers were appropriately handled through education and self-criticism. (3) Simultaneously with the takeover work, each factory began to organize trade unions. Before the trade unions were fully established, the leaders of the Administration uniformly arranged for each factory to conduct study sessions and carry out education on current affairs and policies, stabilizing and improving the production enthusiasm of the employees. In addition, the factories' prior preparation of sufficient materials and raw materials was also a very favorable condition for the rapid resumption of production.

　　沈阳七个纺织厂增产
  　已超过国民党统治时的水准
    【新华社沈阳十三日电】东北纺织管理局所属沈阳纺织厂、辽阳纺织厂沈阳分厂、沈阳以南苏家屯纺织厂及沈阳染织厂等七个工厂，生产效能已超过国民党统治时期的水准。该七个工厂在去年十一月初接收后不到十天，即先后复工。据十一月份统计：平均每日转动的纱锭有一万七千七百余锭，至月底共计产纱八百四十九件（每件四百磅）。每锭每日比国民党统治时少开一个钟点，但却增产零点零四磅。质量方面，国民党统治时每月产纱总平均支数为十四点七支，现平均增为十七点三支。十二月份开动织布机二百五十台，虽较国民党统治时少开九十六台，但产布总量却较前增加了百分之四十，共计产布七千六百三十二匹。各厂产量迅速提高的主要原因是：（一）迅速地确定了各厂生产任务。使生产秩序安定下来。各厂十一月上半月开工，下半月纺织管理局即给各厂具体定出生产任务，使各部人员转入生产，迅速消除了刚解放时的某些混乱。（二）以教育与检讨等方法，适当地处理了技术人员、职员、与工人之间不团结的问题。（三）与接收工作同时，各厂即开始了组织工会工作。而在职工会还没有健全之前，管理局的领导人便统一的布置各厂进行学习，进行了时事与政策的教育，安定并提高了职工的生产情绪。此外各厂事先准备了充分的物资与原料，也是迅速恢复生产的极有利条件。
