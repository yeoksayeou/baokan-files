　　The People's Liberation Army is Here
  　A Record of the PLA Entering the City on the First Day
    Liu Baiyu
    "The People's Liberation Army will enter the city at 1:00 PM!" This was the news that spread throughout Beiping on the morning of January 31st. Telephone bells rang everywhere. In an instant, the streets were packed with people, all looking forward, all pushing forward. A broadcasting vehicle drove by, and the loudspeaker blared: "Dear compatriots! Beiping has achieved true peace! The People's Liberation Army you have been waiting for day and night is entering the city! They have brought the glorious victory of the Chinese people..." Before the words were finished, applause and slogans erupted like a thunderclap, and colorful flags were thrown into the sky. People said, "Spring has come early this year. Look, aren't those our people's heroes?" The soldiers of the People's Liberation Army marched in, each with a red, smiling face. The people of Beiping all remembered: on these same streets, how many troops had marched before, but those were all anti-people troops. In those times, people silently lowered their heads and walked away resentfully. Now, millions of arms were raised so naturally, waving, and millions of people were smiling and shouting so enthusiastically. The Nationalist army, which had not yet completely withdrawn, tried to prevent a rickshaw puller from shouting slogans welcoming the People's Liberation Army, but the rickshaw puller resolutely replied, "We poor people are shouting this ourselves!" Nothing could stop the people's path. People were merged into one voice, a voice of joy. They were merged into one action, an action of welcoming the People's Liberation Army.
    On Huguo Temple Street, a father held up his son, raising the child's small hand in the air. Many women rushed forward to shake hands with the female comrades of the People's Liberation Army, jumping and dancing. The PLA officers in the jeeps stood up and waved to the surroundings. A crowd of people immediately reached out to the cars, pleading, "Comrade, let me shake your hand!" The people felt this was an honor, a happiness. When the advance guard of the People's Liberation Army marched towards Chaoyangmen, an old woman suddenly rushed towards a soldier, grabbing his hand and saying, "You've finally come!" Dongsi Pailou turned into a sea of people, not pre-arranged, but naturally gathering together. The procession of joyous parades grew larger and larger. Many schools, such as Peking University, Northeast University, Railway College, Changbai Teachers College, etc., all gathered into the people's ocean. On the streets, gongs and drums beat densely, so many people sang, so many people shouted slogans, colorful young men and women danced the Yangko happily in the middle of the street. A young man gave a speech by the side of the street, surrounded by a circle of people. Rickshaw pullers stood on their rickshaws clapping, and several children climbed up the utility poles, their faces smiling like morning flowers. Another group of children clenched their small fists and shouted loudly, "Long live the People's Liberation Army!" An old man with a long beard also danced with a group of young people. The young people happily lifted him up, and he raised his arms and shouted, "Long live Chairman Mao!" "Long live Chairman Mao!" A burst of passionate howls, applause, and cheers erupted like a storm. The vast people's ocean continued to surge north, and people shouted, "Let's go to Tieshizi Hutong to慰问 the troops entering the city!" In the blink of an eye, the square inside Dongkou was filled again. The magnificent ranks of the People's Liberation Army also arrived. The students saw them at a glance, swarming up, countless hands reaching out to shake hands tightly with the PLA heroes. Yangko teams turned around to the soldiers one after another. The soldiers shouted slogans like a storm, and the students answered with songs. They sang of the Communist Party, sang of the people's youth, and sang of their own direction. They sang: "You are the lighthouse, illuminating the ocean before dawn. You are the helmsman, controlling the direction of navigation. Young Chinese Communist Party: you are the core, you are the direction." The young people surrounded their troops in circles, and the citizens surrounded the young people in circles. Many fathers looked at their sons and smiled, sisters pulled their younger brothers and smiled, and everyone kept smiling until the lights of thousands of homes were lit, and people were still smiling, still smiling.
    At the same time as the carnival at Tieshizi Hutong, Zhantan Temple was also bustling with activity. Peking University sang celebration songs, Northeast University danced the Yangko, and North China College performed agricultural dances. Suddenly, Dai Ailian, the nationally renowned dancer, appeared in the crowd. She had not yet given a public performance since coming to Beiping. Today, she came to the soldiers, and she happily danced a "Youth Dance" amidst applause. Yes, from 1:00 PM on January 31, 1949—this memorable moment—Beiping began its brilliant youth.

　　解放军来了
  　记解放军入城的第一天
    刘白羽
    “解放军下午一点钟进城!”这是在一月三十一日上午传遍了北平城的消息。电话铃到处叮叮响，一时之间，街道上人群挤得水泄不通，人们向前望着，人们向前拥挤。一辆播音车开过来了，扩音器响着：“亲爱的同胞们！北平得到了真正的和平！你们早晚盼望的人民解放军进城了！他们带来了中国人民底光荣的胜利………”话还未了，掌声口号声就轰然爆发，五采的小旗纷纷抛上天空去。人们说：“今年春天来得早，看哪：那不是咱人民的英雄吗？”解放军的战士，一个个扬着晒得红红的笑脸走来。北平人都记得：在这同样的街道上，曾经走过多少军队，不过那些都是反人民的军队，那些时候，人们都沉默地低下头，愤恨地走开，现在千万条手臂那样自然地扬起来，摇看，千万个人那样热情地笑着、喊着。还没撤完的国民党军队想禁止一个三轮车夫喊口号欢迎解放军，可是车夫坚决地回答他：“我们穷人叫我们自己喊的！”什么东西都不能阻挡人民的道路，人们都溶合在一个声音里，这声音是快乐的声音。他们溶合在一个行动里，这行动是欢迎解放军。
    护国寺街头上，一个父亲把儿子举了起来，一只手扬着孩子的小手，许多妇女抢上去跟解放军的女同志拉起手来又蹦又跳。小吉普车上解放军的军官站起来，向四周招手。一群人立刻把手伸上汽车要求着：“同志，我跟你拉拉手吧！”人民觉得这是光荣，是幸福。当解放军前头接防部队走向朝阳门的时候，一个老太太突然扑向一个战士，接着他的手说：“你们可来了？”东四牌楼变成了人海，不是事先约定，而是自然汇集起来的，狂欢游行的行列越聚越多，北京大学、东北大学、铁路学院、长白师院等等许多学校，都汇集到人民的海洋里来了。大街上锣鼓密密地敲，多少人唱歌，多少人喊口号，花花绿绿的男女青年，快乐得在街心里跳着秧歌舞。一个青年在街旁边发表演讲，周围聚了一圈人，三轮车夫站到车上拍巴掌，几个小孩子爬上了电线杆，他们的脸笑得象早晨的花朵，另外一群小孩子捏着小拳头高声喊：“解放军万岁！”一个胡子很长的老年人，也和一群青年们一道跳舞，青年们高兴得把他举起来，他振臂高呼：“毛主席万岁！”“毛主席万岁！”周围一阵激情的呼啸，鼓掌欢呼的声音，简直有如暴风雨。巨大的人民的海洋，继续向北涌去，人们喊：“到铁狮子胡同慰问入城部队去啊！”一转眼又拥满了东口内的广场，雄伟的解放军的行列也来了，同学们一眼望见，蜂拥上去，无数的手争先恐后地伸出来，和解放军英雄们紧紧地握手，秧歌队一队队地转到战士面前来，战士们风暴一样地喊起口号，同学们就唱歌来回答，他们歌唱共产党，歌唱人民的青春，歌唱自己的方向。他们唱：“你是灯塔，照耀着黎明前的海洋。你是舵手，掌握着航行的方向，年青的中国共产党：你就是核心，你就是方向。”青年们团团地围着自己的部队，市民们又团团围着青年，不少的父亲望着儿子笑，姐姐拉着弟弟笑，一直笑到万家灯火，人们还在笑，还在笑。
    和铁狮子胡同的狂欢同时，旃坛寺里也热闹成一团，北京大学唱庆祝胜利歌，东北大学扭秧歌舞，华北学院表演农作舞，忽然，人丛中出现了驰名全国的舞蹈家戴爱莲，她到北平来还没有公开表演过。今天，她走到战士的面前来，她快活地在一片掌声中跳了个“青春舞”。是的，从一九四九年一月三十一日下午一点钟——这个可纪念的时刻，北平开始了她底灿烂的青春。
