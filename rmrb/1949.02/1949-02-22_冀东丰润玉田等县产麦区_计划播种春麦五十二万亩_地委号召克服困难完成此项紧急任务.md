　　[Jidong Electric] The 15th District is vigorously leading the spring plowing and wheat planting work. The district includes seven counties, including Yutian and Fengrun, and is one of the main wheat-producing areas in eastern Hebei. However, due to the drought in the autumn of last year, only 250,000 mu of winter wheat were planted. At the joint meeting of production section chiefs of various counties at the end of November last year, it was planned to plant 520,000 mu of spring wheat in the entire district to make up for the lack of winter wheat planting. In order to smoothly carry out this work, the 15th Regional Party Committee issued instructions at the beginning of the month, pointing out that rural work in the next month should focus on planting spring wheat, mobilizing the masses to complete the plan of planting a large amount of spring wheat, and making it the most important task of party committees at all levels in wheat-planting areas. This is an extremely important task to increase production and overcome disasters. It also emphasized that wheat planting work is time-sensitive and seasonal. Cadres in counties and districts with more wheat planting should form work teams, except for those who must adhere to other work, and invest in the wheat planting campaign to lead and help the masses specifically solve the difficulties of seeds, livestock, fertilizers, insecticides, etc. Under the leadership of the county production committee, immediately improve the production leadership organizations of districts and villages in wheat-planting areas. The county farmers' association, women's federation, shops, banks, and exchanges should also designate relevant cadres to participate in leading the wheat planting work. In order to prevent wheat diseases, insect pests, and drought, the instructions pointed out: publicize "seed soaking" to the masses to prevent yellow dwarf disease, and apply ferrous sulfate at the same time as sowing to remove mole crickets and other pests. Widely publicize the lessons learned from the reduction in yield of Baodi wheat last year due to jaundice to make farmers vigilant in prevention. There was no rain last year, and there was no heavy snow in winter. Areas that could plant spring wheat in previous years may not be willing to plant due to the drought. It is necessary to organize the masses to dig wells, open canals, and divert river water to irrigate the land and plant wheat, and lead the masses to do everything possible to overcome drought and complete this work. In the masses, it is necessary to overcome the backward thinking of some people who simply rely on government assistance and do not actively think of ways. All counties should try their best to adjust and solve the difficulties of lack of seeds, livestock, and fertilizers within their respective counties. It is also necessary to develop free lending to activate the stagnant rural funds and grain. For districts and villages with special difficulties, cooperatives can organize funds from other districts to adjust, but it must be guaranteed that there are loans and repayments. For military and cadre families who lack labor, grain loans can be used to solve the seed difficulties, and a contract labor system can be adopted to ensure wheat planting. The instructions finally called on production committees at all levels to vigorously exert their leadership role, and party branches and party cadres to play a core leading role. And use various mass and cadre meetings to combine the publicity of victory news with the development of wheat planting and disaster relief work. Launch challenge competitions between districts, villages, households, and cadres, strive for models, and use radio and blackboard newspapers for extensive publicity to complete the great task of wheat planting.

　　冀东丰润玉田等县产麦区
  　计划播种春麦五十二万亩
    地委号召克服困难完成此项紧急任务
    【冀东电】十五分区大力领导春耕种麦工作。该分区包括玉田、丰润等七县，为冀东主要产麦区之一，但由于去年秋季天旱地干，只播种秋小麦二十五万余亩，去年十一月底各县生产科长联席会议上，计划全区播种春小麦五十二万亩，以补秋麦播种之不足。十五地委为顺利开展此一工作，于月初发出指示，指出：今后一个月农村工作应以种春麦为中心，发动群众完成大量种春麦的计划，成为种麦地区各级党委头等重要工作。这是增加产量、克服灾荒的极重要的一项工作。并强调称：种麦工作是有时间性、季节性的，各种麦较多县、区之干部，除去必要坚持其它工作的人员外，应组成工作队，投入种麦运动，领导与帮助群众具体解决种子、牲畜、肥料、杀虫药等困难。在县生产委员会领导下，立即健全种麦区的区、村生产领导组织，县农会、妇联会、商店、银行、交易所，亦指定有关干部参加领导种麦工作。为防止小麦病害、虫害及天旱等，指示则指出：向群众宣传“浸种”以防黄黑疸病，与下种同时施用黑矾除去蝼蛄等害虫。广泛宣传去年宝坻小麦因起疸而减产的教训，使农民警惕防止。去年无雨，冬季又无大雪，往年能种春麦地区，可能又因地干而不肯种，这必须组织群众挖井、开渠、引河水浇地种麦，领导群众想尽一切克服天旱办法，完成这一工作。在群众中必须克服某些人单纯依靠政府帮助，自己不积极想办法的落后思想。各县要尽可能在本县范围内，把缺种子、牲畜、肥料等困难设法调剂解决。并要发展自由借贷，把停顿的农村资金、粮食活跃起来。对特别困难的区、村，则可通过合作社从他区组织资金调剂，但要保证有借有还。对缺乏劳动力的军干属，可用贷粮来解决种子困难，采用包工代耕制保证种上小麦。指示最后号召各级生产委员会，应大力发挥领导作用，支部、党员干部起核心带头作用。并利用各种群众、干部会议，宣传胜利消息与开展种麦、渡荒工作结合起来。发动区、村、户以及干部之间的挑战竞赛，争取模范，并利用广播、黑板报作广泛宣传来完成种麦工作伟大任务。
