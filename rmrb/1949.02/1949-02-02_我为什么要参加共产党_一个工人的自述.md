　　Why I Joined the Communist Party
    ——A Worker's Autobiography
    The Communist Party gave me a great deal of help as soon as it arrived. Before the Communist Party came, my family couldn't afford to send me to school, but since the Communist Party came, schooling was free, and I got the chance to go to school. Later, I joined the workforce and went to the factory to learn skills, and I felt the warmth of the Communist Party even more. Apprentices here (in a certain public factory in the Liberated Area) are not oppressed or exploited, and they can quickly learn skills, as well as some cultural, political, and revolutionary knowledge, which is very different from the time before the Communist Party came! In the old society, apprentices were very lowly, and suffered great oppression and exploitation. When I was a child, I saw my elder brother go to Tianjin as an apprentice, but I never saw him again! I heard that when my brother was an apprentice, his wages were barely enough to eat, and he didn't eat well. He couldn't earn enough to pay for his clothes and daily necessities, and his family had to supply them. Needless to say, he was also abused, getting up at five in the morning and going to bed in the middle of the night, wiping tables and sweeping the floor to serve the boss, and he was often beaten and scolded. As for learning skills, that was very difficult. After being an apprentice for many years, they wouldn't let you "graduate"! My elder brother suffered such oppression and exploitation, especially eating poorly and being overworked, and he died of illness!
    Now that I have been an apprentice for nearly two years, I have received such warm treatment from the Communist Party, and under the leadership and education of the Party, I have learned skills, and my cultural, political, and revolutionary knowledge has greatly improved. I have also seen with my own eyes the Communist Party's struggle for the people's cause, and I recognize that the Communist Party is truly a party of the proletariat. I have personally experienced that the Communist Party is like my home. There is no way out without following the Communist Party, and there would be no such life today without the Communist Party!
    I had wanted to join the Party organization a long time ago, but at that time the Party was secret, so I didn't dare to make a request to the Party. Since a mass meeting was held, where the masses openly introduced new Party members to join the Party, I dared to make a request to the Party and resolved to join the Communist Party. After making a request to the Party, I received help from many Party members, and I also resolved to ask comrades to help me with all my shortcomings, overcome them, and resolve to make progress, work hard, study hard, and spend more time reading newspapers and documents published by the Party. I must improve my technical, cultural, and political level, and contribute to the final victory of the revolution. Not only will I make progress myself, but I will also help comrades who are less aware than I am. In the revolutionary cause, I must take the lead, unite with comrades, help and love each other, work together, and strive together to fight to the end for the final victory of the revolution.

　　我为什么要参加共产党
    ——一个工人的自述
    共产党一来到，就给了我一个很大的帮助。共产党没来前，我家是供不起我念书的，从共产党来了，上学不拿学费，我才得到上学的机会。后来我又参加工作，到工厂学技术，更感到共产党的温暖。咱这里（解放区某公营工厂）学徒是不受压迫和剥削的，很快的就能学到技术，还能学到文化、政治、革命的一些知识，比起共产党没来的时候大不同！在旧社会里，学徒是非常下落的，受压迫剥削很大。我小时亲眼见到我大哥到天津做学徒，可是以后不见他回来了！听说大哥学徒时候，工钱仅仅能够吃到饭，并且吃的不好。穿的衣服和日常用的东西挣不出来，还得由家里供给。这不用说，还得受虐待，每天起五更，睡半夜，擦桌扫地地伺候掌柜的，还常挨打挨骂。说到学技术，那就很难了，当好些年学徒，还不让“出师”呢！我的大哥，就是受这样压迫，剥削，特别是吃不好又劳累，得病死了！
    现在我学徒将近两年了，受到共产党这样温暖的待遇，受到党的领导与教育，使我学到了技术，并且使我的文化、政治、革命知识水平大大进了一步。我并亲眼看到共产党的为人民事业而奋斗的事实，我认识了共产党真正是一个无产阶级的党。我已亲身休验到共产党好比我的家，不跟着共产党走是没有出路的，没有共产党就没有今天这样的生活！
    很早以前我就想参加党的组织，那时党是密秘的，所以我也不敢向党提出要求。自从开了一次群众大会，由群众公开介绍新党员入党，我才敢向党提出要求，决心参加共产党。向党提出要求后，又得到了好多党员的帮助，我也决心要把自己所有的缺点叫同志帮助，把它克服，决心要求进步，努力工作，努力学习，有时间多看报纸和党发表的一些文件，一定要把自己的技术、文化、政治水平提高一步，要为最后的革命胜利出一些力量。不但我自己进步，并且还要帮助比我觉悟程度低的同志；在革命事业中，要起带头作用，要和同志们团结，互助互爱，共同努力，共同为革命的最后胜利而奋斗到底。
