　　The Nanzhuang People's School That Persisted for Four Years
　　Zhao Laifu, Zhang Dangui
　　The Nanzhuang Village People's School in the Fourth District of Quyang, officially established in February 1944, persisted for a full four years until January of this year.

　　The school began when Communist Party members Yang Dengyin, Yang Qingshan, and two others formed a study group to improve their literacy, which then sparked the learning interest of some young men and women. This motivation arose entirely because they had been too poor to attend school in the past, were functionally illiterate, and couldn't distinguish between denominations of money when going to markets and fairs, spending 500 yuan as if it were 50 yuan. Not only did they overspend, but they were also ridiculed. Therefore, they resolved to study. At the time, due to the exemplary role of the Party members, they united the young and middle-aged people (including men and women) in the village who were willing to learn, and formally changed the study group into a people's school. In less than a few months, the number of students increased to sixty (forty-two men and eighteen women). Throughout the four years of learning, the number of students who regularly persisted in learning was always over thirty.

　　The results of the four years of persistent study have been significant, improving the cultural and political level of village cadres and the masses. Yang Yanqi, a shepherd who was illiterate, is now a teacher at the people's school. Tian Wenke became a primary school teacher. Farmers Tian Zhendong and Tian Hai can now read the People's Daily. Most students can read the "Dazhong Bao" and Beiyue Daily published in the county, and have learned addition, subtraction, multiplication in abacus calculation. Seven women have learned to write introductions, contracts, keep accounts, and read ordinary letters. Several of the more advanced students are writing large characters quite well. They said, "Let's practice hard! We will learn to write couplets for the New Year." Their enthusiasm for learning is particularly high. They ask questions if they don't understand until they get it. During the four years, the people's school trained eight cadres who left production, promoted one elementary school teacher, and four people were admitted to complete primary school. Their spirit of hard study has spread throughout the surrounding villages for more than ten miles, and they are unanimously praised as a model for the entire district.

　　In addition to the Party branch being the core of leadership, the organization and leadership of the people's school also organized a model group (the members of this group directly led the learning of each group, although they were not called group leaders, they actually played the role of group leaders), playing a core backbone role. According to their respective requirements and different levels of education, they were divided into eight groups (five for men and three for women) for abacus calculation, calligraphy, applied writing, miscellaneous characters, and Mandarin. The number of people in each group varied. Usually, they studied separately in groups, and studied together during political lessons. When encountering difficult problems during learning, they first submitted them to the model group for answers. This learning is entirely based on a high degree of consciousness and willingness. Various systems and rules in the people's school are completely democratically discussed and decided by everyone, and they consciously abide by and implement them, and have already developed this habit. It is also stipulated that there will be a monthly exam and a system of asking for leave in case of absence.

　　The combination of production and learning for the students solved the difficulties in learning. In the first few years, the lamp oil, paper, pens, and ink used for learning were generally self-provided. When a drought occurred the year before last, self-sufficiency was difficult. As a result of democratic discussion, they collectively reclaimed more than two mu of wasteland (planting hemp seeds, vegetables, yams, and buckwheat). After planting for two years, the fruits obtained completely solved the problem of lamp oil, paper, pens, and ink. Therefore, everyone's enthusiasm for learning was further improved, and the economic expenditure of the masses in the village was saved. During the busy farming season, they also implemented mutual aid. When women spin and weave cloth in cellars, they also combine learning, studying lessons on their own, and practicing new words, which not only does not delay production, but also allows them to persist in learning.

　　The main experiences of the Nanzhuang People's School in persisting in learning are:

　　(1) The basic key lies in the core leadership of the branch and the unity of the masses by Party members in learning. The Party inside and outside the Party in Nanzhuang Village are united, the relationship between the Party and the masses is good, and no matter what work, they can complete it under the leadership of the village branch in accordance with the instructions of the higher Party committee. The students can play a role in publicity and promotion in completing various tasks. All systems in the village, such as Party lessons, can be regularly adhered to.

　　(2) It is necessary to cultivate activists in learning, form a backbone, and drive the general public. For example, the model group in the village formed the backbone of the people's school, driving the learning of each group. The difficulties raised in the people's school were solved with their help. All the systems in the people's school were implemented through them, and they could all lead everyone to implement them by setting an example.

　　(3) The content of learning should be based on the different needs of the students in order to consolidate everyone's enthusiasm for learning. For example, Tian Zhendong was illiterate and spent five hundred yuan as if it were fifty yuan. This phenomenon of losing money due to not recognizing banknotes was very common. The leadership should seize this fact to educate everyone, which had a great effect; especially for Tian Zhendong himself, it further encouraged his determination to learn. When women asked to learn to write words such as cotton, weaving, clothes, etc., the people's school taught them these, which made their enthusiasm for learning even higher. In addition, attention should be paid to changing different learning content in different seasons in order to arouse students' interest.

　　(4) All systems in learning should be democratically discussed and decided by the students in order to be implemented. For example, the examination and leave system were implemented after democratic discussion.

　　坚持四年的南庄民校
    赵莱芙、张丹桂
    曲阳四区南庄村的民校，自一九四四年二月正式成立，到今年一月，坚持了整四年。
    这个民校的开始是共产党员杨登印、杨庆善等四人为了提高文化，成立学习小组，随后引起了一部分青年男女的学习兴趣。这种动机之所以产生，完全因为他们过去家庭贫苦，不能上学读书，当着睁眼的瞎子，赶集、赶会认不清钱票，把伍百元的当伍拾元花了，多花了钱还不算，并且被人耻笑，因此他们下定了决心，一定要学习。当时由于党员的模范作用，团结了村中愿学习的青壮年（包括男女），将学习小组正式改成民校，不到几个月，学员增加到六十名（男四十二名，女十八名），在四年的学习中，经常坚持学习的总在三十人以上。
    四年来坚持学习的结果，得到了很大的成绩，提高了村干部、群众的文化政治水平。不识字的羊工杨彦其，现在当了民校教员，田文科当了小学教员，农民田振东、田海已能看下人民日报，一般的学员都能看下本县出版的“大众报”、北岳日报，珠算学会了加减乘法。七个妇女学会了开路条、写文约和记帐、看平常的信。几个程度较高的，大楷字已写的不错。他们说：“使劲练习吧！过年时咱们要学好写对联。”他们的学习情绪是特别高涨的，他们不知道就问，一直到明白为止。在四年中间，民校共培养了脱离生产的干部八名，提拔小校教员一名，考入完小四名。他们这种努力学习的精神，已传遍了周围十余里的村民，一致称赞为全区的模范。
    民校的组织领导，除以支部为领导核心外，还组织了一个典型组（该组组员直接领导各小组的学习，虽不叫组长的名称，实则起了组长的作用），起核心骨干作用。根据各自的要求与不同的文化程度，共分为珠算、毛笔字、应用文、杂字、国语等八个小组（男五个、女三个）各组人数多少不一，平时以小组为单位，分散学习，上政治课时集中学习。在学习中间发现了疑难问题，首先提交典型小组给解答。这种学习完全是建立在高度的自觉和自愿基础之上的。民校中的各种制度与规则，完全是大家民主讨论决定，自觉遵守执行，都已经养成了这种习惯。并规定每月一次考试和有事必请假的制度。
    学员的生产与学习相结合，解决了学习中的困难。开始几年，学习时所用的灯油、纸张、笔墨，一般都是自备。前年发生旱灾时，自备均感困难，经民主讨论的结果，集体刨种了二亩多荒地（种的有大麻子、蔬菜、山药、荞麦）。连种了二年，所得果实，全部解决了灯油、纸张、笔墨的问题。因此，更加提高了大家的学习热情，节省了村中群众的经济开支。在农忙时，他们还实行拨工互助。妇女在窨子里纺线织布时，也结合着学习，自习功课，练习生字，既不耽误生产，也能坚持学习。
    南庄民校之所以能坚持学习主要经验是：
    （一）基本关键在于支部的核心领导，和党员在学习中团结了群众。南庄村的党内党外，是团结一致的，党与群众关系好，不论什么工作，都能按照上级党的指示，在村支部的领导下完成。学员在完成各种工作中都能起宣传与推动作用。该村的一切制度如上党课等，都能经常坚持。
    （二）必须培养学习中的积极分子，形成骨干，带动一般，如该村的典型组即形成了民校的骨干，带动各组学习，民校里所提出的疑难，经他们帮助解决，民校里一切制度，经过他们贯彻，他们都能以身作则带起大家执行。
    （三）学习内容，要根据学员的不同需要，才能巩固大家的学习情绪。如田振东不识字，把五百元的票儿当五十元花了，这种因不认识票子花钱吃亏的现象很普遍，领导上要抓紧这事实来教育大家，收效很大；尤其对田振东本人，更鼓励了他的学习决心。妇女们要求学写棉花、织布、衣服……等字，民校就教她学习这些，使她们的学习情绪就更高起来。另外在不同季节也要注意改变不同的学习内容，才能引起学员的兴趣。
    （四）学习中的一切制度，要经学员的民主讨论决定，才能贯彻执行。如考试、请假等制度，都是经过民主讨论才执行的。
