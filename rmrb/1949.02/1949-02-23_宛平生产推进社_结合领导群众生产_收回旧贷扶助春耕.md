  　Combining Leadership and Mass Production
  　Recovering Old Loans to Support Spring Plowing
    [Report from this newspaper] The Wanping County Production Promotion Cooperative in Chahar Province convened a meeting of all cadres on January 2nd to review shortcomings in past work, summarize experiences, and formulate the following business plan: 1. Combine production with the recovery of agricultural loans. Last year, Wanping County loaned a total of 450,480 catties of grain, of which more than 340,000 catties have been recovered. The remaining amount will also be collected as much as possible by the end of February this year (except for individual households that are unable to repay for the time being), in order to support agricultural production this spring. In the process of recovering agricultural loans, it is necessary to closely combine it with the organization of production, and prevent the practice of simply recovering agricultural loans without regard to mass production. The Seventh District did this work more successfully in the past. When recovering agricultural loans, they combined it with leading the masses in production, organizing the cutting of thorny branches and the making of hoe handles, promoting exports, and exchanging them for edible salt. The Promotion Cooperative purchased edible salt and used it to offset part of the loan grain. The masses were very satisfied with recovering agricultural loans from the profits of mass production.
    2. Give full play to the role of agricultural loans and lay the foundation for the large-scale production movement this spring. First, based on the specific conditions of Wanping, use agricultural loans to support coal yards and export large coal. Support a blacksmith furnace in each district, and drive all the blacksmith furnaces in the county to prepare sufficient agricultural tools for this year's large-scale production. Those blacksmiths who have difficulties in starting the furnace can also use agricultural loans for assistance. Third, in accordance with the policy of developing animal husbandry, the Production Promotion Cooperative decided to focus on issuing agricultural loans in villages with large populations, little land, and proximity to mountains, and organize local people to engage in animal husbandry and breed livestock. In this way, it can not only solve the problem of the county's lack of draught animals, but also create new conditions for farmers' production in poor areas. The Promotion Cooperative also decided to purchase 64 female animals and draught animals from other counties based on the existing financial strength of the cooperative (the Promotion Cooperative purchased 36 livestock last winter and has already loaned them out at one-third to one-half of the purchase price) and lend them to farmers. Fourth, support the pottery kilns and stone pencil mines. The pottery kilns in Qingshui Village were destroyed by the enemy during the Anti-Japanese War, and furniture was lacking. They have not been able to resume work for a long time. It was decided to support their resumption of work. Now, 3,000 catties of millet and one livestock have been loaned, and a set of furniture has been supplied. The masses are preparing to start work. The Guishi and Zhaojiatai villages in the Seventh District were able to solve the livelihoods of the local people before the Anti-Japanese War. The meeting decided to vigorously help them fully resume work and expand their operations (two mines have already started small-scale operations).
    3. Promote slow-selling goods and exchange them for necessities. In the spring and summer of last year, the masses were organized to produce and overcome famine. The Promotion Cooperative collected more than 28,000 catties of Wulan leaf paste (for dyeing cloth) and some thorny branches. Now, more than 10,000 catties of paste have been pushed to Anguo and Gaoyang, and most of them have been sold, exchanging for 179 bolts of cloth, and promotion is continuing. Thorny branches have been taken to Kouwai to find sales channels. The necessities exchanged can replenish funds and be used to organize the masses for expanded reproduction.
    4. Improve business operations - handle credit loans and supply and marketing. Supply and marketing business is combined with credit business, unified leadership, and unified expenditure; credit business makes agricultural loans circulate continuously through supply and marketing business, and supply and marketing business promotes the sale of products and supplies production materials through credit business.

　　宛平生产推进社
  　结合领导群众生产
  　收回旧贷扶助春耕
    【本报讯】察哈尔省宛平县生产推进社，于一月二日，召集全体干部会议，检讨了过去工作中的缺点，总结了经验，作出了如下的业务计划：一、结合生产收回农贷。去年宛平全县共贷出粮食四十五万零四百八十斤，现已收回三十四万多斤，余数亦将在今年二月底（除了个别户还不起的暂缓外）尽可能的收齐，以便扶植今春农业生产。在收回农贷当中，要与组织生产密切结合起来，防止单纯收回农贷，不顾群众生产的作法，过去七区这一工作作的比较成功，他们在收回农贷时，结合着领导群众生产，组织割荆条、砍镐柄，推销出口，换回食盐，推进社就收买食盐，顶交一部贷粮，从群众生产盈利中收回农贷，群众非常满意。
    二、发挥农贷的作用，打下今春大生产运动的基础。首先根据宛平的具体条件，以农贷扶植煤栈，输出大煤。每区扶植一个铁匠炉，并把全县的铁匠炉也带动起来，为今年大生产准备足够的农具。铁匠开炉困难者，也可动用农贷帮助。第三、按照发展牧畜业的政策，生产推进社决定有重点地在人多地少靠山近的村子发放农贷，组织当地人民从事牧畜，繁殖牲口。这样，既可解决全县耕畜缺乏问题，又可在贫瘠地区创造农民生产的新的条件。推进社又决定根据社内现有的资金力量，再到外县去购买六十四头母畜和耕畜（推进社去冬已购入三十六头牲畜，并已按买价的三分之一到二分之一贷出）贷给农民。第四、扶植缸窑与石笔矿。清水村缸窑在抗日时期被敌人破坏后，家具缺乏，长期未能复工，决定扶植其复工，现已贷给小米三千斤、牲口一头，并供给家具一部，群众正准备动工。七区圭石、赵家台两村的石笔矿，抗战前能解决当地人民生活，会议决定以大力帮助其全部复工与扩大经营（现已有两个矿小型的动工）。
    三、推出压手货，换回必需品。去年春夏两季，组织群众生产渡荒，推进社收有乌兰叶膏子（染布用）二万八千余斤、荆条一部，现已把膏子推往安国、高阳一万余斤，并已销出大部，换回布一百七十九匹，现正继续推销。荆条子已到口外去找销路。换回的必需品，又可充实资金，用于组织群众的扩大再生产。
    四、健全业务——办理信用贷款与供销。供销业务与信用业务结合起来，统一领导，统一开支；信贷业务通过供销业务使农贷川流不息，供销业务通过信贷业务，推销生产品供给生产资料。
