　　Ji-Lu-Yu Holds Women's Representative Congress
  　Elects Delegates to North China and National Women's Congresses
    [Ji-Lu-Yu Electric] The Ji-Lu-Yu District Women's Representative Congress, which opened on the 5th of this month, successfully concluded on the 13th after nine days. At the beginning of the congress, Comrade Pan Fusheng, secretary of the District Party Committee, and Deputy Director Han Zheyi of the Administrative Office made political and production reports. The Women's Federation reported to the congress on the women's work in the district and conducted group discussions. The representatives gained a deeper understanding of the great tasks of leading women in the large-scale production movement, supporting the Liberation War, and striving for national victory in the future. During the meeting, in a spirit of democracy, thirteen official representatives to the National Women's Congress, including Zhang Xiuyan and Wan Danru, and twenty-six official representatives to the North China Women's Congress, including Dong Wenhua, were elected. The Ji-Lu-Yu District Women's Federation Committee was also re-elected, and nineteen new Women's Federation Committee members, including Bai Lin, were elected. Finally, the congress summarized its gains and pointed out that: First, the representatives recognized their responsibility to serve the broad masses of women and to lead the broad masses of women in production and support the People's Liberation War. Second, the Women's Federation was re-elected, and the organization was strengthened. And according to the Central Committee's decision on rural women's work, the women's work in the district was inspected. Democratic education was accepted, as reflected in the broadness of democracy at the congress, such as representatives from all walks of life, all departments, and all regions; there were female workers, production models, support-the-front models, support-the-army models, preferential treatment to military families models, army enlistment models; there were rural women, female cadres who have led women's movements for many years; and female staff members from administrative, economic, cultural, and educational departments. In terms of age, there were both young and middle-aged people and elderly people. The shortcomings are that the democratic spirit was still not fully developed; the organization and leadership of the meeting were not sound enough.

　　冀鲁豫召开妇女代表大会
  　选举出席华北及全国妇大代表
    【冀鲁豫电】在本月五日开幕的冀鲁豫区妇女代表大会，历时九天，于十三日胜利闭幕。大会开始，由区党委书记潘复生同志行署韩哲一副主任作了政治和生产报告。妇联对大会报告本区妇女工作。并进行分组讨论。各代表更深刻认识到今后领导妇女大生产运动，支援解放战争，争取全国胜利的伟大任务。会议中以民主精神选举选出参加全国妇代大会的正式代表张秀岩、万丹如等十三名，参加华北妇代大会的正式代表董文华等廿六名；并改选了冀鲁豫区妇联委员，选出新妇联委员白林等十九名。最后大会总结收获指出：首先是代表们认清了为广大妇女服务与领导广大妇女生产、支援人民解放战争的责任。其次是改选了妇联，健全了组织。并根据中央关于农村妇女工作的决定，检查了本区的妇女工作。接受了民主教育，表现在大会上民主的广泛性，如代表来自各阶层、各部门、各地区；有女工、有生产、支前、拥军、优军、参军等工作模范；有农村妇女，有领导多年妇运的女干部；有行政、经济、文化、教育等部门的女工作人员。年龄上则有青壮年也有老年。缺点是民主精神发挥的仍不够充分；在会议组织领导上不够健全。
