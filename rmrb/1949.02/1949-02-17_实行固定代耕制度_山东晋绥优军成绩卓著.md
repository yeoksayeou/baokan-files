Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 12th. Party and government organs in Shandong and Jin Sui are actively leading the broad masses of people to earnestly provide preferential treatment to the families of revolutionary martyrs, military personnel, and staff members. Thanks to the adoption of a fixed substitute farming system, great achievements were made last year. In Shandong Province, from the spring famine last year until the end of the year, the Lu Zhongnan area alone distributed nearly 10 million jin of relief grain to military families and others in need. During the production and disaster relief campaign, various localities generally reorganized substitute farming organizations and established a fixed substitute farming system for military families with no or insufficient labor, providing timely assistance in plowing, planting, hoeing, and harvesting. In Baiyang, Lou (Xia) Dong County, some villages not only combined substitute farming organizations with production organizations but also allocated fixed substitute farming based on the acreage to be farmed for military families, the amount of labor available, and the strength of the village production team's labor and livestock, assigning substitute farming by mu (a Chinese unit of measurement for land) and by labor/livestock power. To make the substitute farming organization more complete, a substitute farming team leader was set up in the village for unified management, with the production team leader participating in the substitute farming team to plan production for military families in a timely manner and supervise and inspect team members' substitute farming. Substitute farming team leaders solicited opinions from military families on substitute farming at any time. In Henan, Qingshui, and other villages in the Liangmu District of Pingdu, in addition to doing a good job in spring and summer substitute farming, they also ensured that military families were plowed for first during winter plowing before plowing for themselves. In Jin Sui, a fixed substitute farming system was also implemented. Military families in Shenchi and Wuzhai who lacked labor expressed satisfaction with the adoption of fixed substitute farming, as it ensured that crops could be cultivated on time and yields could reach the same level as those of ordinary farmers. However, according to inspections in Jin Sui, shortcomings still existed in the work of providing preferential treatment to revolutionary military families in some areas. The main problem was that attention was only paid to providing preferential treatment to the families of new recruits or local military personnel or those living nearby, while insufficient attention was paid to revolutionary martyrs' and military families whose children had joined the army earlier, or who were from other places, or who lived in more remote areas. In some individual cases, the priority and amount of assistance were simply determined according to the different components of poor, hired, and middle peasants, and no consideration was given to the needs of the families of martyrs and military personnel from landlord and rich peasant backgrounds who were genuinely experiencing difficulties in both livelihood and labor. Some even regarded the work of providing preferential treatment to military families as a means of mobilizing people to join the army. Now, the Jin Sui People's Government has decided that each village should establish a preferential treatment committee with the participation of military families, responsible for inspecting the difficulties faced by martyrs' families, military families, etc., in agriculture, and that the village people's representative assembly should discuss and decide on specific solutions, and educate military families to actively engage in production.

### 实行固定代耕制度　山东晋绥优军成绩卓著

　　实行固定代耕制度
  　山东晋绥优军成绩卓著
    【新华社陕北十二日电】山东和晋绥党政机关积极领导广大人民认真优待革命烈士家属、军人家属、和工作人员家属，由于采取了固定的代耕制度，去年一年获得很大成绩。山东省自去年春荒时起至年底为止，仅鲁中南区即先后对生活困难的军属等发放救济粮近一千万斤。在生产救灾运动中，各地较普遍地整理了代耕组织，建立了给无劳力或劳力不足的军属等的固定代耕制度，及时帮耕、帮种、帮锄、帮收。楼（霞）东县白洋的部分村庄不仅实行了代耕组织与生产组织相结合的办法，而且按军属等所要代耕的田亩与劳力多寡、全村生产小组劳力与牲畜强弱，按亩按劳力畜力分配固定代耕。为使代耕组织更健全，村设代耕队长统一管理，生产小组长参加代耕组，及时为军属等计划生产并督促检查组员代耕。代耕小组长随时征求军属等对代耕意见。平度两目区河南、清水等村除作好春夏代耕外，冬耕时并做到先给军人家属耕，后给自己耕。在晋绥，也同样实行了固定代耕制度。神池、五寨缺乏劳动力的军人家属对采用固定代耕的办法表示满意，因为固定代耕保证了作物能按时耕作，产量又能达到一般农民作物一样。但根据晋绥的检查，优待革命军人家属工作在部分地区仍存在缺点，主要的是只注意优待子弟新参军的或本地的、或居住附近的军人家属，对于子弟早已参军的、或外来的、或居住较远地方的革命烈属和军属则注意照顾不够，个别的则单纯按照贫雇中农的不同成份来决定帮工的先后和多少，对于地主富农出身的烈属和军属而生活和劳力两者确有困难者，不给予照顾。还有的甚至把优待军人家属工作当作动员参军的一种手段。现晋绥人民政府已决定各村建立有军属参加的优军委员会，负责检查烈属、军属等在农业中的困难，由村人民代表会讨论和决定具体解决办法，并教育军属等积极生产。
