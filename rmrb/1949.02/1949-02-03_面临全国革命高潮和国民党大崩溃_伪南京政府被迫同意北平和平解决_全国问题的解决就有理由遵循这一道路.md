Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 1st – The attitude of the Nanjing Kuomintang reactionary government towards the peaceful resolution of Beiping is worthy of attention. The Kuomintang Central News Agency published a statement by General Fu Zuoyi on January 22nd, stating that the peaceful resolution of Beiping was "to quickly shorten the war, obtain a peaceful consensus from the people, preserve the foundation of industry and commerce and cultural relics, so that the nation's vitality will no longer be damaged, in order to promote the early realization of thorough peace throughout the country." On January 27th, the Central News Agency also published a statement from the Nanjing government's Ministry of National Defense stating: "In North China, in order to shorten the war and achieve peace, thereby preserving the foundation of the ancient capital of Beiping and cultural relics, Commander-in-Chief Fu Zuoyi issued a statement on the 22nd, announcing a ceasefire from 10:00 AM on the 22nd. The majority of the National Army in the Beiping area immediately followed the headquarters' instructions and successively withdrew from the urban area, entering designated locations. A small number of Communist troops have already entered the urban area. Ceasefires will also be implemented in Suiyuan and Datong." Having been defeated, with all hope gone, the better way out was for the troops to leave the city for reorganization, allowing the People's Liberation Army and the People's Government to peacefully take over the city defenses and municipal administration. This is the basic reason for the peaceful resolution of the Beiping issue. Why was Tianjin unwilling to do this? Shouldn't Tianjin's "foundation of industry and commerce and cultural relics" be preserved? Should Tianjin's national vitality be damaged? Why should we "promote the early realization of thorough peace throughout the country" on January 22nd, but not on January 13th, preventing a peaceful resolution in Tianjin? The fundamental reason is that General Fu Zuoyi still wanted to fight. Tianjin was defeated; in twenty-nine hours, more than one hundred thousand people were disarmed, and the bandit leaders Chen Changjie, Lin Weichou, Du Jianshi, and others were all captured. Beiping was isolated and hopeless, and the determination to take the second path—peaceful resolution of the Beiping issue—arose from this. On January 15th, the People's Liberation Army captured Tianjin. On the 16th, Generals Lin Biao, Luo Ronghuan, and Nie Rongzhen formed a basic agreement on peacefully resolving the Beiping issue with General Fu Zuoyi's representatives, General Deng Baoshan and General Zhou Beifeng. In the following days, many agreements on details were also established. General Zhou Beifeng had left the city once on January 8th, guided by Professor Zhang Dongsun, and spoken with General Lin Biao and others; this time out of the city was the second time. Isn't the fundamental reason for peacefully resolving the Beiping issue the strength and victory of the People's Liberation Army? The people of Beiping, including the working people, the bourgeoisie, and the gentry, all eagerly hoped for a peaceful resolution, which is another reason. On January 19th, eleven representatives of the people of Beiping left the city and openly negotiated with the People's Liberation Army. They were very satisfied after hearing the lenient treatment policies of the People's Liberation Army. The headquarters of the 41st Army of the People's Liberation Army hosted the representatives, holding cordial talks and banquets. One of the representatives was former Beiping Mayor He Siyuan, who was previously the chairman of the Shandong Kuomintang Provincial Government, resolutely opposed the People's Liberation Army, and also firmly suppressed the people when he was the mayor of Beiping. He is one of the cadres of the Kuomintang "CC" clique's northern faction. No matter how badly he has done in the past, this time he did the right thing. Another representative was Lü Fu, who was a legislator within the Kuomintang's legal system. Another representative was Ms. Kang Tongbi of the Beiping Antiquities Preservation Agency. The rest were representatives of official people's organizations. They are the expression of the so-called "peaceful consensus of the people" in the sentence "obtain a peaceful consensus from the people" in General Fu Zuoyi's statement on January 22nd. Regardless of all this, they represented the true will of the people, which is completely different from the so-called "peace offensive" that the Kuomintang "CC" clique was energetically clamoring for in the southern provinces over the past half month, mobilizing official parliamentary chambers of commerce, trade unions, etc. People must not confuse the two. The local peace movements that have recently begun to brew in Nanjing, Shanghai, and Wuhan are also initiated by the bourgeoisie and the gentry, and should belong to the same category as He Siyuan, Lü Fu, and Kang Tongbi, and are therefore opposed by the "CC" clique's die-hard war criminal Pan Gongzhan. Another reason for the peaceful resolution of Beiping is that nearly 200,000 Kuomintang troops, with the exception of a few die-hards, from soldiers to generals, generally did not want to fight. General Fu Zuoyi, representing this sentiment after the loss of Tianjin, made the determination to leave the city for reorganization. No matter how reactionary Fu Zuoyi was in the past, and how deeply the people of North China hated him, this matter can be considered the right thing to do. As long as he moves in a direction favorable to the people's cause in the future, is willing to bow his head to the people, assists in the army reorganization issue, does not play an obstructive role, and no longer attempts to perch on the heads of the people and oppress them, the People's Liberation Army has reason to explain to the people, pardon his war crimes, and give him a new way out. Why did the Nanjing government also agree to do this? This is a manifestation of the nationwide revolutionary upsurge and the total collapse of the Kuomintang. They have no choice but to agree, just as they have no choice but to agree to the Communist Party's eight peace conditions as the basis for negotiations. Under the pressure of the people of the whole country, they are isolated, their 200,000 troops have already done so, and they have no choice but to agree. This agreement is of great significance, and the issues of the whole country have legitimate (in accordance with the Kuomintang's law) reasons to follow the path of Beiping to resolve them. They have no reason to oppose others doing so elsewhere. Although the Kuomintang die-hards, led by Chiang Kai-shek, are still preparing to "resist to the end," they will be completely and thoroughly isolated, and their reactionary policies will be quickly smashed by the revolutionary tide of the people.

　　面临全国革命高潮和国民党大崩溃
    伪南京政府被迫同意北平和平解决
    全国问题的解决就有理由遵循这一道路
    【新华社陕北一日电】南京国民党反动政府，对于北平的和平解决采取什么态度，是值得注意的。国民党中央社于一月廿二日发表傅作义将军的文告，该文告称北平的和平解决，是为了“迅速缩短战争，获致人民公议的和平，保全工业商业基础与文物古迹，使国家元气不再受损伤，以期促成全国彻底和平之早日实现。”一月廿七日中央社又发表南京政府国防部的文告称：“华北方面，为了缩短战争，获致和平，借以保全北平故都基础与文物古迹，傅总司令作义曾于廿二日发表文告，宣布自廿二日上午十时起休战。平市国军大部当即遵从总部指示，先后撤离市区，开入指定地点。共军已有少部开进市区。绥远大同两地亦将实施休战。”战败了，一切希望都没有了，比较好的一条出路，是军队离城改编，让人民解放军和人民政府和平地接收城防和市政，这是北平问题和平解决的基本原因。为什么天津不肯这样做呢？难道天津的“工业商业基础与文物古迹”不应当保全吗？难道天津的国家元气应当受损伤吗？为什么一月廿二日应当“促成全国彻底和平之早日实现”，而在一月十三日就不应当，而令天津的和平解决不能实现呢？基本的原因是傅作义将军还想打一打。天津打败了，廿九个钟头内十几万人解除武装，陈长捷、林伟俦、杜建时等匪首一齐被俘，北平孤立了，毫无希望了，决心走第二条路，和平解决北平问题的可能性从此产生。人民解放军十五日攻克天津，十六日林彪罗荣桓聂荣臻三位将军即和傅作义将军的代表邓宝珊将军、周北峰将军成立了和平地解决北平问题的基本协议，往后数日又成立了细节方面的许多协议。周北峰将军是在一月八日由张东荪教授引导出城和林彪将军等谈过一次的，这回出城是第二次。和平地解决北平问题的基本原因是人民解放军的强大与胜利，难道还不明显吗？北平人民，包括劳动人民，资产阶级及绅士们在内，一齐渴望和平解决，又是一个原因。一月十九日北平人民的十一个代表出城和人民解放军公开接洽，他们听了人民解放军方面的宽大处理政策，甚为满意。人民解放军第四十一军军部招待了代表们，举行了畅谈和欢宴。代表们中的一个是前北平市长何思源，他是过去山东国民党省政府的主席，坚决反对过人民解放军，当北平市长时也是坚决压迫人民的，他是国民党“ＣＣ”系北方派的干员之一。不管他过去做得怎么坏，这一次总算做对了。又一个代表是吕复，他是国民党法统内的立法委员。又一个代表是北平古物保管机关的康同璧女士。其余是官办的民众团体的代表。他们就是二十二日傅作义将军文告中所说“获致人民公议的和平”那一句话中所谓“人民公议”的表现。不管这一切，他们总算是代表了真正的民意，这和过去大半个月内国民党“ＣＣ”系在南方各省策动官方的参议会商会工会等起劲地叫嚣的所谓“和平攻势”，是截然不同的，人们切不可将这二者混为一谈。最近南京上海武汉开始酝酿的局部和平运动，也是资产阶级及绅士们策动的，应属于何思源、吕复、康同璧这一类，因而被“ＣＣ”系死硬派战争罪犯潘公展所反对。北平和平解决的又一个原因，是近二十万的国民党军队除少数几个死硬分子外，从兵士们到将军们，一概不愿打了。天津失守后的傅作义将军代表了这种情绪，下了出城改编的决心。不管傅作义过去如何反动透顶，华北人民如何恨之入骨，这件事总算是做得对的。只要他以后向有利于人民事业的方面走，愿意向人民低头，在军队改编问题上予以协助，不起阻碍作用，而不再企图高踞在人民头上压迫人民，人民解放军就有理由向人民说明，赦免他的战犯罪，并给他以新的出路。南京政府为什么也同意这样干呢？这是全国革命高潮和国民党大崩溃的表现他们不得不同意，就象他们不得不同意以共产党的八个和平条件为谈判基础一样。在全国人民的逼迫下，他们孤立了，他们的二十万军队已经这样做了，他们无法不同意。这一同意是有巨大意义的，全国的问题就有合法（合国民党之法）理由遵循北平的道路去解决，他们丝毫也没有理由反对别地这样做了。尽管以蒋介石为首的国民党死硬派还在准备“抵抗到底”，但是他们将被完全地彻底地孤立起来，他们的反动政策会被人民的革命浪潮迅速地打得粉碎。
