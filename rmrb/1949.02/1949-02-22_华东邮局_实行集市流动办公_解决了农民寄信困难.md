Xinhua News Agency, East China, 19th: The East China liberated area post office implemented a mobile market office method, which solved the difficulty for farmers in mailing letters and won the support of the farmers. As early as August of last year, a post office in Linqu, Lunan District, Central Shandong, took the lead in implementing the mobile market office method, hanging up signs at each market to collect letters, and posting mail rate charts to explain to farmers attending the market. The farmers unanimously reflected: "In the past, we wrote letters but couldn't find a post office, so we had to give up mailing them. Now that you come to the market to collect letters, it's convenient for us to mail letters." Subsequently, more than ten post offices such as Lishui (newly established county east of Tengxian), Anqiu, etc., also implemented the mobile market office method. The Lishui Post Office also posted advertisements on traffic arteries regarding postal services and the scope of mail delivery, and developed drafts worth more than 1.3 million yuan in half a month. After the Anqiu Post Office started operating in the market, its income doubled compared to before. The Lijin Post Office in the Bohai District received mail from six markets, which was well received by the masses. In terms of business promotion, post offices in various places also paid great attention. When the Zhangli Post Office conducted market publicity in the newly recovered area of Longshan, it first posted newspapers and took the opportunity to promote postal services while the masses were reading. Other local post offices also used blackboard newspapers or radio stations to promote business, so that the masses could understand the postal situation in the liberated areas. After the liberation of Jinan, the city post office initially used announcements and news in newspapers to publicize postage and tax scope when restoring postal services. When East China and North China implemented inter-regional remittances, the bureau broadcast the news through radio stations and showed slides in cinemas for publicity. At the same time, it also posted the names of the receiving bureaus and the amount of remittances outside the post office and wrote leaflets to distribute to various businesses. Therefore, the development of taxation was very rapid, and the remittance business in the first ten days of December last year was double the amount of the entire month of November.

　　华东邮局
  　实行集市流动办公
  　解决了农民寄信困难
    【新华社华东十九日电】华东解放区邮局实行集市流动办公办法，解决了农民寄信不便的困难，深得农民拥护。远在去年八月，鲁中南区临朐某邮局即首先实行了集市流动办公的办法，在各集上挂起牌子收信，同时张贴邮件资费表向赶集的农民进行说明。农民一致反映：“过去写了信找不到邮局只好不寄，现在你们来集上收信，俺寄信就方便了。”接着麓水（在滕县以东，新设县）、安邱等十余个局亦相继实行集市流动办公的办法。麓水局并在交通要道上张贴有关邮业政务及通邮范围的广告，在半月中曾开发汇票达一百三十余万元。安邱邮局在集市上办公后，收入较前增加一倍。渤海区利津局揽收六个集的邮件后，颇得群众好评。在业务宣传方面，各地邮局也很注意。章历局在龙山新收复区进行集市宣传时，先张贴报纸，趁群众围着阅读的时候宣传邮政业务。其他地方的邮局尚有用黑板报或广播台等方式进行业务宣传的，使群众了解解放区通邮情形。济南解放后，市邮局在恢复邮政业务时起初用通告和新闻的形式在报上公布邮资和税务范围等项。当华东与华北地区实行通汇后，该局又通过广播电台广播消息和电影院放映幻灯进行宣传，同时并在邮局门外张贴迎汇局名和汇额规定以及书写传单分发各商号。因此税务开展很快，去年十二月上旬的汇兑业务，就比十一月全月增加一倍。
