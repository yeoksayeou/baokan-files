　　Hebei Central Farmers
  　Cherish Land Certificates as Honored Guests
    【Xinhua News Agency, North China, 15th】The farmers in the Hebei Central Liberated Area, after receiving land certificates issued by the democratic government at the end of the land reform, cherished them as if they were precious treasures. Farmers in Qijie, Xinji, after holding a grand meeting and performing a play on the eighteenth day of the Lunar December last year to celebrate the issuance of land certificates, often used "Inviting the God of Wealth on the Eighteenth of Lunar December" as a catchphrase when they met. After the Jin County Shilipu Village government retrieved the stamped land certificates, all the farmers in the village were eager to receive them. After the land certificate was issued, a farmer named Zhao Laoduo couldn't bother watching the play celebrating the issuance of land certificates. He hurried home and carefully looked at his land certificate under the light. He saw that the five mu of land south of the village was written as three mu. Fearing that the village government would not change it, he worried and couldn't sleep all night. The next day, he found the village cadre to change it, and the weight in his heart was finally lifted. Women in Dongshi Village, Jin County, all received land certificates. They said, "This is what it means to improve women's rights!" Yan Chao, a lazybones in the village, had not chopped down the cotton stalks in the fields until the land reform certificates were issued, so the village government did not issue him a land certificate. He felt too embarrassed and asked his elder brother, Yan Laoying, to plead for him, guaranteeing that he would engage in production properly in the future, and only then did he receive the land certificate. He said to the land certificate with a smile, "Land certificate, you are my life! If I don't produce, you are useless! You used to run to the landlord's house all the time, but now you don't mind that my family is poor! I will go and chop cotton stalks right away, and I'll harvest so much grain that I won't be able to eat it all!"

　　冀中农民
  　热爱土地证如获至宾
    【新华社华北十五日电】冀中解放区的农民，在结束土地改革中领到民主政府所发给的土地证，如获至宝。辛集七街农民在去年旧历腊月十八日开大会演戏庆祝发土地证后，大家见面时常把“腊月十八请财神”当做口头禅。晋县十里铺村政府取回盖了印的土地证后，全村农民都急着领取。当发了土地证后，一位叫赵老多的农民便顾不得看那庆贺发土地证的戏，连忙跑回家中，在灯下细细看他的土地证，看到了村南的五亩地写成了三亩，因怕村政府不给改，愁的一宿没睡觉，第二天找到村干部给他改过来，心里一块石头才落了地。晋县东石村的妇女都领了土地证。她们说：“这才算提高了女权哩！”该村有个好吃懒做的阎吵，直到发土改证时还没有把地里的棉花柴砍下来，所以村政府就不给他发土地证。他觉着太难看，托他的哥哥阎老硬给他讲情，保证以后好好生产，才领到了土地证。他笑嘻嘻地对着土地证说：“土地证，是我命，不生产，不中用！早先你净往财主家跑，这会你不嫌俺家穷！立时我去砍棉柴，打的粮食吃不清！”
