Xinhua News Agency, Tianjin, 28th: In order to clarify Tianjin's finances and unify Tianjin's currency, the Tianjin Military Control Commission of the People's Liberation Army stipulates that all public and private accounting and transaction pricing in the city shall be calculated in the banknotes issued by the People's Bank of China, and temporarily allows the banknotes issued by the Ji'nan Bank and the Northeast Bank to circulate at the legal exchange rate. All illegal currencies issued by the Kuomintang reactionary government in the past (including Gold Yuan Certificates, Northeast Circulation Certificates, etc.) must cease circulation before February 4th. However, to take care of the difficulties of merchants and residents, those holding counterfeit Gold Yuan Certificates worth more than 100,000 yuan are allowed to register with the Customs or the Industry and Commerce Bureau and transport them out of the country to exchange for materials; those holding less than 100,000 yuan are allowed to apply to the Tianjin Branch of the People's Bank of China for registration, be issued an enemy currency carrying permit, and transport them out of the country to exchange for materials; if merchants and residents have difficulty exchanging and transporting on their own, they may exchange them for local currency at the People's Bank of China Tianjin Branch at the listed price. Factory workers, farmers, students, teachers, and impoverished citizens holding counterfeit Gold Yuan Certificates worth less than 500 yuan can exchange them for local currency at the bank at a preferential exchange rate. Regarding foreign currencies, the commission stipulates that all foreign currencies are strictly prohibited from being priced and circulated in the market or from being privately bought and sold. Merchants and residents holding foreign currencies must exchange them for local currency at the People's Bank of China at the listed price before the 31st of this month. It is also stipulated that the people are allowed to hold all gold, silver, and silver coins, but they must not be carried out of the country, priced and circulated, or privately bought and sold. Those who voluntarily sell them are limited to exchanging them at the People's Bank of China.
