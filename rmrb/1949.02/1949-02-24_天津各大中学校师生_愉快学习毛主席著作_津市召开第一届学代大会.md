    Happily Study Chairman Mao's Works
    Tianjin Holds First Student Congress
    [Tianjin Electric] After liberation, teachers and students of major universities and middle schools in Tianjin are enthusiastically studying revolutionary theories such as Chairman Mao's famous work "On New Democracy" with unprecedented joy. The societies in Nankai University, Peiyang University, Hebei Institute of Technology, Provincial Girls' High School, and Private Yaohua Middle School are the most active in the study upsurge, holding discussions and seminars to discuss "On New Democracy". The study society of Nankai University, composed of professors, lecturers, teaching assistants, and students, has more than 130 members and has held four collective discussion meetings to study "On New Democracy" and the CCP's land reform policies. Forty-nine professors, lecturers, and teaching assistants from Peiyang University, including Zhang Guofan, Ma Simeng, and Hao Tongsheng, also jointly established a New Democracy Study Group to study "On New Democracy" and "On Coalition Government". Students from private Yaohua, Guangdong, Zhejiang, and other middle schools urgently requested to learn revolutionary knowledge. A student from Zhejiang Middle School said: Now we are like a group of children, completely ignorant of politics. In addition to organizing study groups independently, they also asked comrades from the work team to help them explain policy issues. The Municipal Normal School has listed "On New Democracy" as a formal course, teaching it for five hours a week. Because the Tianjin Xinhua Bookstore could not meet the demand for "On New Democracy", Nankai, Peiyang, and other schools specially mimeographed books such as "On New Democracy" and "On Coalition Government". Important articles published in the Tianjin Daily have also become learning materials for teachers and students of various schools. To make reading more convenient for students, many schools have also added libraries and reading rooms.
    [Xinhua News Agency, Tianjin, 21st] The first Tianjin Student Congress was held on the 18th, and standing committee members of the Preparatory Committee of the Tianjin Student Union and representatives to the National Student Congress were elected. A total of more than 100 representatives from 57 universities and middle schools, including Nankai University, Peiyang University, and Nankai Middle School, attended the conference. The conference elected nine universities and colleges, including Peiyang University, Nankai University, Hebei Provincial Institute of Technology, Private Nankai Middle School, and Hebei Provincial Girls' Middle School, as standing committee members of the Preparatory Committee of the Tianjin Student Union to be responsible for handling daily work. At the same time, four universities and colleges, including Nankai University, Peiyang University, Nankai Middle School, and Hebei Provincial Girls' Normal College, were elected as executive committee members to participate in the North China Student Federation, and Hebei Provincial Institute of Technology and Nankai University were elected as Tianjin representatives to attend the National Student Congress. In addition, Nankai University and Peiyang University have received separate invitations from the Preparatory Committee of the National Student Congress and are preparing to attend the National Student Congress.

　　天津各大中学校师生
    愉快学习毛主席著作
    津市召开第一届学代大会
    【天津电】解放后的天津各大、中学校师生，正以空前未有的愉快心情，热烈学习毛主席名著“新民主主义论”等革命理论。南开大学、北洋大学、河北工学院、省立女中、私立耀华中学等校内的社团，在学习热潮中最为活跃，纷纷举办讨论会、座谈会、讨论“新民主主义论”。南开大学由教授、讲师、助教、同学共同组成的学习社，有一百三十多社员，举办了四次集体讨论会，研讨“新民主主义论”及中共的土地改革等政策。北洋大学张国藩、马思猛、郝桐生等四十九位教授、讲师、助教，也于日前共同成立了新民主主义学习会，学习“新民主主义论”及“论联合政府”等。私立耀华、广东、浙江等中学学生，迫切要求学习革命知识。浙江中学一个同学说：现在我们好象一群小孩，对于政治茫茫无知。他们除自动组织学习小组外，并要求工作组同志帮助他们解释政策问题。市立师范学校已把“新民主主义论”列为正式课程，每周讲授五小时。由于津市新华书店的“新民主主义论”的供不应求，南开、北洋等校，特自己油印“新民主主义论”及“论联合政府”等书籍。天津日报所登载的重要论文，也成为各校师生学习材料。为使同学们阅读方便，许多学校并增设了图书馆，阅览室。
    【新华社天津廿一日电】天津市第一次学生代表大会已于十八日召开，选出了天津学生联合会筹备委员会常务委员，和出席全国学生代表大会的代表。出席大会的共有南开大学、北洋大学、南开中学等五十七所大、中学校的代表一百余人。大会选出北洋大学、南开大学、河北省立工学院、私立南开中学、河北省立女子中学等九院校为天津市学生联合会筹备委员会常务委员，负责处理日常工作。同时又选出南开大学、北洋大学、南开中学和河北省立女子师范学院等四院校为参加华北学联的执行委员，河北省立工学院、南开大学两院校为出席全国学生代表大会的天津区代表。此外，南开大学和北洋大学已受全国学生代表大会筹委会的单独邀请，准备出席全国学生代表大会。
