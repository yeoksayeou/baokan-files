Xinhua News Agency, North China, 11th -- The publicly-operated Shigejie Liberation Coal Mine in Changzhi, Taihang, has greatly increased its coal production due to the correct implementation of employee policies, which has increased employee work enthusiasm. The mine's original planned daily output for last year was 240 tons (English tons), but by December of last year, daily output had increased to 430 tons. The copper wheels on the mine's high-lift cable, after being replaced with cast iron by the mine's technicians in April of last year, greatly reduced manufacturing costs while actually improving the wheel's performance. In the past, copper wheels needed to be replaced twelve times every three months, with a total raw material cost of 7 million yuan. After switching to cast iron, only two replacements were needed every three months, with a raw material cost of only 40,000 yuan. Workers who could previously only watch two mine cars can now watch three. The reasons for the increased work enthusiasm of the mine's employees, in addition to the positive role played by the employees' union in conducting political education, are also due to: 1. The implementation of a piece-rate wage system and bonus system. In the seven months from May to November of last year, the mine spent more than 23 million yuan on bonuses. 2. The establishment of employee welfare and social insurance programs. Over the past year, the mine has built 42 workers' dormitories, solving the workers' housing difficulties. Workers injured on the job continue to receive their wages; medical expenses for the sick are covered by the mine, and 50% to 90% of wages are paid according to the specific circumstances. Employee cooperatives, employee children's schools, and worker night schools, and other workers' living welfare organizations have also been established.

　　石圪节煤矿实行按件计工
  　成本减少产量大增
    【新华社华北十一日电】太行长治公营石圪节解放煤矿，由于正确执行职工政策，使职工工作积极性提高，煤产有极大增加。按该矿去年原订计划日产量为二百四十吨（英吨，下同），但到去年十二月，日产量即增至四百三十吨。该矿高车上的绷绳铜车轮，经该矿技师于去年四月以灰铁代替铜制后，制造成本大大减少，车轮效能则反而提高。过去的铜制车轮每三个月需换十二次，所用原料共值七百万元，经改用灰铁制造后，三个月只需换两次，原料成本却只需四万元。过去只能看两部元车的工人，现在能看三部。该矿职工工作积极性提高的原因，除职工会对职工进行政治教育起了一定作用外，还由于一、执行了按件计工的工资制与奖励制度。自去年五月至十一月的七个月中，该矿共支出奖励金达二千三百余万元。二、职工福利与社会保险事业的建立。一年来，该矿共建立工人宿舍四十二间，解决职工住宿困难。对因公受伤的工人，工资照发；患病者医药费均由矿方解决，并按具体情况发给百分之五十至九十的工资。职工合作社、职工子弟学校和工人夜校等工人生活福利组织，亦已创办起来。
