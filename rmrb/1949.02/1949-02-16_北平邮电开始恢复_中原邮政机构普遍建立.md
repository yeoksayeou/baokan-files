Xinhua News Agency, Beiping, February 14th: The Beiping Postal Administration began on the 10th of this month to accept and send letters to 819 cities in 21 liberated provinces. More than 400,000 letters that had accumulated in the Beiping Postal Administration before the city's liberation will be sorted and sent out completely within the next few days. In terms of telecommunications, in addition to the smooth operation of intra-city telephones and wireless telephones between Beiping and Zhangjiakou, long-distance telephone lines between the Beiping urban area and the western suburbs of Haidian, Qinglongqiao, Shijingshan, Xiangshan, and Fengtai have also been opened. Currently, workers from the Beiping Telecommunications Bureau are working around the clock under the leadership of the Military Control Commission to repair the underground line between Fengtai and Langfang. It is expected that the "carrier wave telephone" between Beiping and Tianjin will be restored in late this month. At that time, there will be 50 lines for simultaneous calls between the two cities.

Xinhua News Agency, Central Plains, February 13th: Postal organizations in the Central Plains Liberated Area have been universally established, and postal services have developed considerably. Under the unified leadership of the Central Plains Postal Administration, the Central Plains postal area currently has two administrative district postal administration sub-bureaus, fifteen special district postal inspectorates, one hundred and four county post offices, and thirteen municipal post offices. The universal establishment of postal organizations and postal routes in the region has gradually restored postal transportation between various administrative offices, special offices, counties, districts, and villages, and has therefore normalized connections with other liberated areas. The Central Plains Postal Administration has now decided to trial parcel remittance services in Luoyang, Xuchang, Yuxian, Nanyang, Luohe, Xiangcheng, Xinzheng, Fuyang, Shangqiu, Haozhou and other places.

Xinhua News Agency, Bengbu, February 14th: Fang Chongming, a postman at the Mingguang Post Office, protected the post office archives, and Liu Xizhi and three other workers at the Jiashan County Junior High School protected school equipment, awaiting reception by the People's Liberation Army. They have all been commended by the People's Liberation Army. When the People's Liberation Army advanced towards the south bank of the Huai River, postman Fang Chongming voluntarily moved to the post office to live there, guarding the fourteen packages of archives and safe deposit boxes of the Mingguang Post Office. When the Kuomintang bandit army's 20th Army was stationed at Jiashan County Middle School, workers Liu Xizhi, Zhang Xiangcui, Xu Chunming, and Xu Chengye gathered the undamaged tables, chairs, and equipment in eight rooms and guarded them when the bandits were destroying doors, windows, and burning school equipment.
