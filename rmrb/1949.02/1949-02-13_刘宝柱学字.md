　　Liu Baozhu Learns to Read
　　Yuan Sheng
　　Liu Baozhu, a worker in the First Engineering Team, is known by everyone as "Old Man" Liu. At seventeen, he began working as a long-term laborer for wealthy families. Seventeen years of hard labor had made him, a middle-aged man of only thirty-five, look like an old man in his fifties.

　　After the liberation of Shijiazhuang, amid the restoration of transportation, he joined the engineering team, actively participating in the emergency repair of railway projects. Since the trade union leaders taught him to read, he has been studying with great enthusiasm. In addition to the two characters he learns every day, he seeks out literate people to teach him. After work in the evening, he often asks comrades like Yue Fusuo to study with him. During his midday break, instead of sleeping, he also finds people to learn from. Once, with the help of Comrade Liu Zongyi, he learned six characters in one go. In the courtyard where he lives, on the walls of his room, on the ground, and on the stones, everything is covered with written characters. Because he has put in a lot of effort, he has learned more than three hundred new characters in just over half a year of continuous and intense work.

　　Now Liu Baozhu can write and read simple notes, and he can also recognize money. He happily said, "Before, when I sold coal or bought things, I would either get shortchanged or overpay. It really made me angry. In the past, our family was poor, and we couldn't afford to study, so we were illiterate, and we couldn't recognize anything, so we always suffered losses. Now the team and the trade union are teaching us to read, and we are learning for ourselves! How could I not be diligent?" He also said, "From now on, not only will I study hard, but I will also encourage others to study more!"

　　To reward him for helping illiterate workers learn, the trade union specially awarded him a pencil and a notebook.

　　刘宝柱学字
    元生
    第一工程队工友刘宝柱，人们都叫他小老头。十七岁上，他就给有钱的人家扛长活，十七年的长工活，使他一个年纪才三十五岁的中年人，猛一看象五十多岁的老头。
    石家庄解放后，在恢复交通声中，他参加了工程队，积极参加抢修铁路工程工作，自工会领导学习识字后，他学习的特别起劲。除了每天学的两个字外，还到处找识字的人教他，晚上下了工，经常找岳福锁等同志去学，晌午歇晌的时候，他不睡觉，也找人学，有一次，在刘宗义同志帮助下，他一气学会了六个字。在他住的院里、屋里的墙上、地上、石头上，到处写满了字。因为他下了很大苦心，所以在日以继夜的紧张工作中，半年多，认下了三百多个生字。
    现在刘宝柱能写、会看简单的条子，票子也能认下来了，他高兴的说：“从前我卖煤炭，买东西，不是少要了就是多给了，真把我气的没法，过去咱们家穷，念不起书不识字，睁着双眼什么也认不得，净吃亏；现在队部和工会教咱念书识字，是给自己学习哩！还能不用心？”他又说：“从今以后不仅我自己好好学习，还要劝别人多学习哩！”
    工会为了奖励他帮助不识字的工人学习，特奖给了他一枝铅笔和一个本子。
