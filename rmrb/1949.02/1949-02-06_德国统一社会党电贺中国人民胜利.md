Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 30th: Berlin News: The Socialist Unity Party of Germany's Congress, currently being held in Berlin, sent a telegram to the Chinese Communist Party on the 26th to congratulate the great victory of the Chinese people's liberation cause. The telegram stated: "All progressive Germans warmly congratulate the great achievements of the warriors fighting for freedom in China. These achievements strengthen their confidence that the forces of democracy and peace will ultimately triumph over the imperialist warmongers and reactionaries. Your struggle clearly demonstrates how a billion enslaved Asian people have taken action to forever end the centuries of imperialist oppression and exploitation. Chiang Kai-shek's downfall proves that the rule of reactionary and corrupt traitors has come to an end. The victory of the Chinese people confirms the words of Comrade Stalin: 'The shameful century of exploiting colonies and mandates has ended.'" The telegram concluded: "Your victory strengthens the power of the German people in their own struggle."

　　德国统一社会党电贺中国人民胜利
    【新华社陕北三十日电】柏林消息：正在柏林举行的德国统一社会党代表大会于二十六日致电中国共产党，祝贺中国人民解放事业的伟大胜利。贺电称：“一切德国进步分子都热烈庆贺中国争取自由的战士们所获得的伟大成就。这些成就加强了他们对于民主与和平力量最后战胜帝国主义战争贩子与反动派的信心。你们的斗争清晰地表明：十亿被奴役的亚洲人民如何采取了行动，以永远终结帝国主义的压迫与剥削的世纪。蒋介石的下台证明：反动与腐化的卖国贼的统治已经到了末日。中国人民的胜利证实了斯大林同志所说的话‘剥削殖民地与托管的可耻的世纪已经结束’。”贺电结语称：“你们的胜利，加强了德国人民在自己的斗争中的力量。”
