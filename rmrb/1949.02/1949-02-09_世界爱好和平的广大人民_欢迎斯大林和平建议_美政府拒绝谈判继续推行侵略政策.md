　　Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, February 7th: TASS, Rome, February 4th: The leadership of the Italian Communist Party issued a statement, on behalf of the Italian working class and all sincere democrats, expressing gratitude for Stalin's new proposal for direct negotiations with President Truman to end the current international disputes and consolidate peace. The leadership of the Italian Communist Party emphasized that the Italian government and the governing parties are trying to involve Italy in the imperialist bloc. This situation requires all those who cherish peace and the future of their country to expand and strengthen their activities to expose the policy of dragging Italy back onto the path of purely imperialist adventure and destruction. The leadership of the Italian Communist Party decided to establish contact with the Socialist Party and all peace-loving democratic forces to plan concrete actions against this policy.
    Another report from Agence France-Presse, Paris, February 3rd: The French Communist Party's Political Bureau meeting concluded today and issued a communique stating that Marshal Stalin's two statements, the Soviet Foreign Ministry's statement on the "North Atlantic Treaty," and the Soviet government's note to the Norwegian government are "contributions of great importance to the defense of peace." The communique stated: If the leaders of the United States refuse to participate in this possible and desirable negotiation because participation would run counter to their war plans and thoroughly expose the secrets of these plans, then they will bear a great responsibility in the eyes of the people.
    Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, February 7th: Telecommunications Agency, Moscow, February 4th: The Soviet people learned this morning that Truman had refused to meet with Stalin. From their initial reactions, they see in Truman's categorical refusal to meet with Stalin a sign that the United States is determined to forcibly establish the North Atlantic Treaty and forcibly continue its policy of establishing military bases that threaten the Soviet Union. This applies especially to the German issue, which is of great concern to public opinion. Readers of Soviet newspapers are able to analyze the reasons against the Truman-Stalin meeting from lengthy excerpts of foreign newspaper comments. The satisfaction expressed by British commentators, who faithfully reflect the views of the British Foreign Office, in welcoming the American rejection of bilateral negotiations, aroused laughter among newspaper readers here. One Soviet citizen said: "If you are so alarmed by the idea of Truman meeting with Stalin alone, then how much do you British people distrust Truman!" However, the people also know the positive response that Stalin's proposal for reconciliation has garnered around the world. Reports from New York, Paris, London, Sydney, Beirut, Rome, and other places show that the broad masses of peace-loving people welcome Stalin's proposal.
    Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, February 5th: TASS, New York, February 4th: U.S. Secretary of State Acheson, held a press conference on February 2nd to discuss the exchange of letters and telegrams between Smith, the European Director of International News Service, and Stalin on the issue of a peace treaty and Germany. Acheson stated that he opposed discussing the peace treaty and other issues mentioned in Smith's letter and telegram to Stalin. A few hours later, President Truman also held a press conference, stating that his views were the same as Acheson's. People here believe that the reason why Truman and Acheson adopted a negative stance is due to the fact that the peace treaty is in direct conflict with the aggressive conspiracy to establish the Atlantic Alliance.

　　世界爱好和平的广大人民
  　欢迎斯大林和平建议
    美政府拒绝谈判继续推行侵略政策
    【新华社陕北七日电】塔斯社罗马四日讯：意共领导机关发表声明，代表意大利工人阶级及一切真诚的民主分子对斯大林所提与杜鲁门总统直接谈判以结束目前国际纠纷和巩固和平的新建议，表示感谢。意共领导机关着重指出，意大利政府和各政府党力图使意大利参加帝国主义集团，这种形势要求一切珍重和平和他们国家的前途的人们，必须扩大与加强活动，揭发将意大利再次拉上纯粹帝国主义冒险和毁灭的道路的政策。意共领导机关决定与社会党及一切爱好和平的民主力量建立联系，规划反对这一政策的具体行动。
    另据法新社巴黎三日电：法国共产党政治局会议今日闭会时发表公报称，斯大林元帅的两次声明与苏联外交部关于“北大西洋公约”的声明及苏联政府致挪威政府的照会，是“对保卫和平具有高度重要性的贡献”。公报称：如果美国的领袖们因为参加谈判会与他们的战争计划背道而驰，并使这些计划的秘密被彻底揭穿，因而拒绝参加这个既可能又可取的谈判，则他们在人民眼中将负很大的责任。
    【新华社陕北七日电】电通社莫斯科四日讯：苏联人民今晨获悉杜鲁门已拒绝和斯大林的会谈。从他们的初步反应看来，他们在杜鲁门断然拒绝与斯大林会晤这件事上看到一个标志，即美国已决心强行成立北大西洋公约，并强行继续其建立威胁苏联的军事基地的政策。这特别适用于舆论大为关心的德国问题上。苏联报纸的读者，从外国报纸评论的长篇摘录中，是能够将反对杜鲁门斯大林会晤的理由加以分析的。以忠实反映英国外交部观点的英国评论员在欢迎美国拒绝双边谈判时所表现的满意，引起了此间报纸读者的笑谈。有一位苏联人说：“要是你们对杜鲁门单独与斯大林会晤的念头感到那样惊慌，那么，你们英国人一定是多么不信任杜鲁门！”但是，人民也知道了斯大林为了和解的提议在全世界所博得的积极反应。从纽约、巴黎、伦敦、悉尼、贝鲁特、罗马及其他各地来的消息表明，爱好和平的广大人民是欢迎斯大林的提议的。
    【新华社陕北五日电】塔斯社纽约四日电：美国国务卿艾奇逊，于二月二日举行记者招待会，谈及国际新闻社欧洲分社社长史密斯与斯大林就和平公约及德国问题交换函电一事。艾奇逊称，他对于讨论和平公约及史密斯致斯大林函电中所提及的其他问题均予反对。在数小时之后，杜鲁门总统亦举行记者招待会，声称他的意见与艾奇逊的意见相同。此间人士认为，杜鲁门及艾奇逊之所以采取否定的立场，是由于这一事实，即和平公约与建立大西洋联盟这一侵略阴谋适相抵触。
