Xinhua News Agency, Shenyang, 29th—The Northeast Administrative Committee convened a special civil affairs conference spanning the entire Northeast region from December 11th to 25th of last year. The purpose was to summarize the experiences of various regions in experimenting with the establishment of people's democratic village governments (referred to as "establishing government") and to deploy the democratic election movement to be carried out this spring in order to universally establish new village governments through popular election. Attendees included the heads of the Civil Affairs Departments of Nenjiang, Heilongjiang, Hejiang, Songjiang, Jilin, Liaobei, Andong, and Liaoning provinces, as well as the heads of the Social Bureaus of the three special municipalities of Changchun, Shenyang, and Harbin, and Andong City, totaling more than 30 people. Chairman Lin Feng personally attended and gave detailed instructions on the work of establishing government in the future.

As early as the beginning of August last year, the Northeast Administrative Committee decided that each province should carry out trial elections for village governments. It stipulated that each province should select a certain number of personnel to form a trial election team and select three or four villages to conduct village election experiments. All provinces then began the trial election work. Except for Songjiang, which used one village per county for experimentation, the rest selected three or four villages throughout the province to start the trial election. Some provincial civil affairs directors personally participated in the leadership. As of the end of November, trial elections had been conducted in 30 villages in the seven provinces of Jilin, Nenjiang, Songjiang, Heilongjiang, Hejiang, Andong, and Liaobei. Although the progress of each province's work varied, they generally paid attention to publicity and explanation, and raised the people's awareness through the elections. In villages where the trial election work was done better, the unity of poor peasants, hired peasants, and middle peasants was generally strengthened, and democratic order and democratic systems were further established in the villages. As a result, village work was easier to promote than before. The work of giving preferential treatment to the families of revolutionary soldiers and revolutionary martyrs was more thoroughly deployed than before. The phenomenon of waste in village finances was overcome, and a system of income and expenditure was established. Through the democratic movement, the spirit of unity among the working people was promoted, thereby solving some problems left over from the land reform, such as housing rights, vehicle rights, and horse rights, and production work was smoothly organized.

There were also some shortcomings in the trial elections in various provinces. In some cases, the publicity and explanation work was not sufficient, causing confusion and anxiety among the masses. In some places, the party and government did not coordinate well, resulting in the trial election team replacing the village government. In others, due to a lack of clarity on the understanding of citizenship, citizens with incomplete physical features were wrongly deprived of their citizenship. Everyone unanimously believed that there were two main keys in the village elections: one was to grasp the nature and members of the people's democratic government and issues such as citizenship; and the other was to effectively mobilize the masses and strengthen leadership.

　　东北召开民政会议
  　布置民主选举工作
    【新华社沈阳二十九日电】东北行政委员会为总结各地试验建立人民民主村政权（简称建政）的经验，布置今春开展民主选举运动以便经由民选普遍建立新的村政权村，特于去年十二月十一日至二十五日专门召开了一个全东北范围的民政会议。到会者有嫩江、黑龙江、合江、松江、吉林、辽北、安东、辽宁八省民政厅长及长春、沈阳、哈尔滨三特别市和安东市社会局长等三十余人。林枫主席亲自出席，对今后建政工作作了详尽的指示。东北行政委员会早于去年八月初即决定各省进行村政权试选工作，规定每省选派一定人员组成试选小组，选择三、四个村子进行村选试验。各省随即开始试选工作，除松江系以每县一个村作试验外，余皆在全省选择三、四个村开始试选，有的省民政厅长亲自参加领导。截至十一月底止，吉林、嫩江、松江、黑龙江、合江、安东、辽北七省，在三十个村中均进行了试选工作。各省工作进度，虽有先后之别，但大都注意了宣传解释工作，从选举中提高了人民的觉悟。凡是试选工作作得较好的村子，一般地都加强了贫、雇、中农的团结，进一步建立了村子里民主秩序与民主制度，因之村上工作较前容易推动。优待革命军人家属与革命烈士家属的工作较前作了更深入的布置。克服了村财政的浪费现象，建立了收支制度。经过民主运动，发扬了劳动人民的团结精神，从而解决了房权、车权、马权等土地改革中遗留下来的一些问题，并顺利地组织了生产工作。各省试选中也存在一些缺点。有的由于宣传解释工作作的不够，引起群众疑惑不安。有的地方党、政配合不好，结果试选组代替了村政权。有的因对公民权认识不清，错误地将五官不全者剥夺了公民权等等。大家一致认为：在村选中的主要关键有两个：一是掌握人民民主政权的性质成员及公民权等问题；一是很好地发动群众与加强领导问题。
