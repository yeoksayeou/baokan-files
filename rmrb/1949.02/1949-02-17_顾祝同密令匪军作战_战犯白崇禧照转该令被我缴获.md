Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 15th. The Jianghan Military Region of the Central Plains People's Liberation Army recently captured an important secret order from Bai Chongxi, dated February 4th, forwarding Gu Zhutong's order of January 29th. It stipulated "Six Key Points for Dealing with the Current Situation" as follows: "(1) Recognize the Communist bandits' intention to completely defeat our Party and our army, and then destroy our country and exterminate our nation. In order to defend the nation and the ethnicity, as well as the survival of the Party and the army, we must make the greatest determination to be irreconcilable with them and resolutely engage in a long-term war of self-rescue, self-defense, and saving the people. (2) The Communist bandits' so-called war criminals in Article 1 of their Eight Points are intended to insult our leader, shake our confidence, and are extremely absurd, and must be severely refuted; and we must strengthen the unity of officers and soldiers and implement a shared life between officers and soldiers. (3) The recent focus of the National Army's operations is to blockade and consolidate the Yangtze River and protect the Northwest and Southwest. Frontline troops should strengthen their vigilance, practice tactics for annihilating the enemy, and strengthen military-political ties and military-civilian cooperation. (4) Rear training units and units without combat missions must step up replenishment training to improve combat spirit and ability, aiming to become elite troops in the short term. (5) We should pay attention to maintaining law and order in the rear; local bandits and acts of spreading rumors, creating incidents, strikes, and sabotage should be strictly prohibited and eliminated. (6) Special attention should be paid to inspiring morale, rectifying discipline, improving the lives of officers and soldiers, winning hearts and minds, and properly improving military-civilian relations in order to create unity and advance to revival. I hope you will carefully study the above items, instruct the National Army to work together to achieve success, that is all." This secret order from war criminal Gu Zhutong naturally reveals the true face of the die-hard elements of the Kuomintang, still headed by Chiang Kai-shek. Here, there is no peace, nor is there any acceptance of the CCP's Eight Points, but only "making the greatest determination to be irreconcilable with the Communist bandits and resolutely engaging in a long-term war of self-rescue, self-defense, and saving the people." However, Gu Zhutong is the Chief of Staff of the Kuomintang's "Acting President Li." If Deng Wenyi said in his speech on the 9th of this month, which advocated war, that he was speaking from the position of the Ministry of National Defense and that the opinions expressed today had not been reviewed by Acting President Li in advance, then was Gu Zhutong's secret order also issued from the "Ministry of National Defense position" and "not reviewed by Acting President Li in advance"? Another interesting question is that Bai Chongxi claims to advocate peace talks under the CCP's Eight Points. Now, he is forwarding Gu Zhutong's order to his subordinates. Does this mean that he has also "made the greatest determination to be irreconcilable with the Communist bandits"?

　　顾祝同密令匪军作战
  　战犯白崇禧照转该令被我缴获
    【新华社陕北十五日电】中原人民解放军江汉军区最近缴获白崇禧二月四日转顾祝同一月二十九日重要密令一件，其中规定“应付时局要领六项”如下：“（一）认清共匪企图，为在彻底击溃我党我军，进而亡我国家，灭我民族。吾人为求捍卫国家民族及党与军之生存，应下最大决心，与之誓不两立，坚决从事长期自救、自卫与救民之战争。（二）共匪八条第一项所谓战犯，意在侮辱我领袖，动摇我信心，荒谬已极，须予严厉驳斥；并加强团结官兵，实行官兵共同生活。（三）国军最近作战重点，封锁巩固长江，并保卫西北、西南。第一线部队宜加强戒备；切实演练歼灭敌人战术；并加强军政联系，军民合作。（四）后方整训部队及无作战任务部队，务须加紧补充训练，以提高作战精神及能力，期于短期内变成劲旅。（五）对后方治安秩序，应加意维持；地方散匪及造谣生事、罢工怠工等行为，应严加取缔肃清。（六）对部队应特别注意激励士气，整顿纪律，改善官兵生活，及收揽人心，妥实改善军民关系，缔造人力人和，进图复兴。以上各项，希切实研讨，指示国军共赴事功，为要。”战争罪犯顾祝同的这个密令，当然表现了仍然以蒋介石为首的国民党死硬派的本来面目。在这里既没有什么和平，也没有什么接受中共八项条件，有的只是“应下最大决心，与共匪誓不两立，坚决从事长期自救，自卫与救民之战争”。但是顾祝同是国民党“李代总统”的参谋总长。如果邓文仪在本月九日发表鼓吹战争的谈话时说是本人系在国防部立场发言，本日所发表之意见事前并未呈经李代总统过目，那么顾祝同的密令是否也是在“国防部立场”下令，“事前并未呈经李代总统过目”呢？另一个有兴味的问题是白崇禧称是主张在中共八项条件下进行和谈的，现在照转顾祝同的命令给他的部下，是不是表示他也已经“下最大决心与共匪誓不两立”呢？
