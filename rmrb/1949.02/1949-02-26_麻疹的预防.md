　　In the spring, children are most susceptible to measles. This is also an acute infectious disease. After contracting the disease, the initial symptom is fever, with a rising body temperature. The second day also brings fever, and on the third day, the patient feels alternating chills and heat. From the fourth to the sixth day, the fever intensifies, with the body temperature reaching 39 or 40 degrees Celsius. By the seventh day, it drops to around 38 degrees, and by the eighth day, it falls to 37 degrees. This is the general course of the illness, and the pulse rate changes accordingly.

　　However, infectious diseases generally cause fever. How can one distinguish measles from other illnesses? To identify measles, there is a very obvious symptom: the appearance of a rash. When the fever reaches its peak on the third or fourth day, small, granular rashes appear on the palate and under the tongue's mucous membrane. This characteristic was discovered by the foreigner Koplik, and is therefore medically known as Koplik's spots. Subsequently, the rash appears on the face and neck, gradually spreading from the chest and back to the limbs, covering the entire body in two days. During this period, the fever continues, and as the fever subsides, the rash gradually disappears. The rash is scarlet red and fades when pressed with a finger, only to immediately return to its red color.

　　Measles is easily detectable. Generally, at the onset of fever, the conjunctiva of the eyelids becomes congested and reddish, accompanied by symptoms of conjunctival irritation such as tearing, sneezing, and coughing.

　　In severe cases of measles, the fever is already very high before the rash appears, reaching 40 degrees Celsius and lasting for five to ten days or more. The pulse is weak and rapid, the patient loses appetite, the rash is abundant and dense, and complications such as pneumonia, heart weakness, difficulty breathing, and otitis media are likely to occur. In some cases, the fever does not subside, and the patient gradually weakens, becomes anemic, and eventually dies.

　　Patients already suffering from measles should have absolute rest. In terms of diet, during high fever, they should drink plenty of fruit juice, vegetable soup, and other liquids. Thin porridge is also acceptable. Furthermore, attention must be paid to the deficiency of vitamin B.

　　Even if the fever is high, do not use ice packs for cold compresses until the rash has fully appeared. The room should be kept warm, free from drafts, and humidified with water vapor. Regularly boil water in a teapot on the stove, allowing the steam to fill the air.

　　After suffering from measles, it is best to avoid going out temporarily, as this could infect others. Moreover, after having measles, one is prone to catching whooping cough, bronchitis, and other infectious diseases, especially tuberculosis, to which susceptibility is greatly increased. Take care not to be near tuberculosis patients.

　　The transmission of measles mainly occurs when pathogens from the patient's saliva and phlegm fall onto objects or are suspended in the air, leading to infection through breathing.

　　For prevention, patients should be isolated immediately. Items contaminated with the patient's sputum or saliva should be strictly disinfected. During epidemics, children should avoid going out as much as possible, such as to theaters, visiting relatives, or going from house to house. For prevention, it is advisable to inject serum from measles convalescents or blood from healthy adults, preferably the blood of the child's parents. This method can not only prevent measles but also treat it.

　　麻疹的预防
    霞萍
    在春季里，小儿最易得麻疹。这也是一种急性传染玻一得了这病，最初是发烧，体温升高，第二日也是发烧，第三日便觉时冷时热，第四日至第六日，更发热，体温高至三十九或四十度（摄氏）至第七日降至三十八度内外，第八日降至三十七度，这是一般的经过情形，脉膊也随热度而变动。
    但是传染病一般都发热，怎么能知道是麻疹或是其他疾病呢？要知道麻疹，有一个最明显的症状，便是发疹。在发热第三、四天达到高度时，在口盖内及舌下粘膜上发现小颗状疹，这个特征是被外国人高布利克氏所发现，所以在医学上叫高布利克氏斑，继续便显于面部、颈部，由胸部、背部渐次扩大弥漫至四肢，经二昼夜便现于全身各部，在这期间继续发烧，及热度退下时，斑疹也渐渐消退。斑疹猩红色，用指压之即退色，旋又立即复呈红色。
    麻疹很容易发现，一般在起初发热时。易于使眼睑结膜充血而湿红，且呈流泪及打喷嚏咳嗽等结膜刺激的症状。
    重症的麻疹，于发疹以前，热度即已达很高，至四十度，继续五至十天以上，脉膊频弱，不进食，斑疹甚多甚密，并易并发肺炎，心脏衰弱，呼吸困难及中耳炎，甚至热度不减，渐渐衰弱，贫血，以至于死亡。
    已经患麻疹的宜绝对安静，食物方面，于热度高时，可多饮水果汁、菜汤等液体，稀粥也可，更须注意乙种维生素之缺乏。
    虽热度增高，但于斑疹未出齐以前，亦不可妄用冰块冷敷，室内务求温暖，勿吹风，使之含有水蒸气，经常让炉子上茶壶煮沸着开水，让它冒热气。
    患麻疹之后，最好暂勿外出，因恐传染他人。且患麻疹后常易得百日咳、支气管炎及其他传染病，尤其是结核感受性甚强，注意不要接近周围的结核患者。
    传染，主要是病原体随患者唾沫及痰液飞落于物品上面，或在空气中，因呼吸而传染。
    预防，患者宜急速隔离，对于沾有患者喀痰或唾沫的物品宜严行消毒，流行期间，小儿最好不外出，如上戏院、探亲、串门子等。预防宜注射麻疹恢复期病人之血清，或健康成人的血液，最好是病儿父母的血液。这种办法不但可以预防，而且可以治疗麻疹。
