　　The Eight Heroes Who Occupied the Shijingshan Power Plant
　　By Our Reporter Zhan Chao
　　In the battle to liberate the Shijingshan area, the site of the Beiping western suburban power plant and steel factory, eight heroes of a certain unit of the Northeast People's Liberation Army, together with many workers and staff of the power plant, engaged in brave and resourceful cooperation, ensuring that Shijingshan's important enterprises were transferred into the hands of the people without any losses.

　　I. Infiltration into the Power Plant
　　At nine o'clock on the morning of the 15th, as the intense gunfire began to subside, the workers of the Shijingshan Power Plant noticed three soldiers walking along the foot of Black Mountain in the northeast direction.
　　"Hey, those are the Eighth Route Army!" After some observation, worker Han Xiangcai, who was looking out from the fifth floor of the power plant building, determined that the three people were soldiers of the People's Liberation Army. This immediately caught the attention of his fellow worker Zhao Jiheng and assistant engineer Zhang Renjie, who were watching with him. However, in the heart of the Kuomintang army's heavily fortified area, it was impossible to see large formations of the People's Liberation Army. Where did these few soldiers come from? Just as everyone was half-believing and half-doubting, a Kuomintang army bunker on the hilltop fired a shot downwards, the shell landing right in the middle of the three people's triangular formation. The three people briefly took cover, then swiftly used the smoke and dust raised by the shell to continue advancing. At this time, the workers clearly saw the three people's uniforms and said in unison, "They really are the Eighth Route Army!" Zhao Jiheng, who had worked for the Kailan Mining Administration in Shanhaiguan (Linyu) during the Anti-Japanese War and often interacted with the Eighth Route Army guerrillas, added:
　　"You can tell they're them just by their movements!"
　　As he spoke, the three brave soldiers of the People's Liberation Army had already dashed into the gate of the power plant and taken cover behind three bunkers respectively. Seeing no movement, the leader, who was carrying a Sten submachine gun, tentatively advanced towards the tall building in the plant. As he cautiously entered the factory building and went up the stairs, he met worker Zhang Wenkui and asked, "Are there any Kuomintang (referring to Kuomintang soldiers) upstairs?" Zhang Wenkui said, "No!" The brave soldier quickly observed the terrain and then rapidly descended the stairs, intending to return downstairs to block the enemy. When he met clerk Shen Gencai at the stairwell and confirmed that there were no enemies upstairs or downstairs at that moment, he rushed up to the fifth floor in one breath and positioned his gun in front of a suitable window. At this time, the two brave soldiers guarding behind the guard post at the gate also followed the same route and swiftly went upstairs.

　　II. Upstairs and Downstairs
　　The news of "the Eighth Route Army is upstairs" secretly spread among the power plant workers. Even some of the older workers working in the old factory building behind the main building knew about it. Yang Qingchun said, "I heard they've all come!" Li Fengming corrected him, "Only three or four people, and they're all on the fifth floor!" "They've got guts!" Just as people were excitedly discussing it, clerk Shen Gencai appeared at the door. He relayed a message to everyone from the factory's wartime defense committee: "Don't anyone give the people upstairs or the machines any unsolicited advice." People nodded knowingly and continued to busy themselves taking care of the operating machines and boilers.
　　At this time, assistant engineer Zhang Renjie had already guided the three brave soldiers up and down the highest fifth floor of the plant. He suddenly remembered that one of the two People's Liberation Army soldiers who had come in later had an injury on his left forehead and should be invited up for medication. He quietly climbed back up to the fifth floor. Half an hour later, clerk Shen Gencai and worker Wang Zhenyu brought pancakes and boiling water upstairs. The workers had already been worried about the hunger and thirst of the brave soldiers and sent their own lunches up to them first.
　　When clerk Shen Gencai came up for the second time, the brave soldier who had first come upstairs and the political instructor with the telescope apologized and told him that five more comrades had arrived. They hoped Shen Gencai could help them get something to eat and drink again. They also asked Shen Gencai, in a friendly manner, if it was possible to stop the rubber belt of the coal conveyor in the pulverized coal furnace, which was constantly moving up and down. Because the front of the floor was too narrow, it was very possible to get caught in the belt and pulled into the coal hopper, and the noise of the machine was too loud, obstructing their vision and hearing. They asked Shen to discuss it with the factory负责人. Ten minutes later, the rubber belt quietly rested in front of the brave soldiers after carrying the last batch of coal.
　　At this time, the Kuomintang army entrenched on Black Mountain and Siping Mountain in the northeast and northwest of the power plant, probably still in shock from the battle in the morning, were still firing blindly downhill from time to time. When stray bullets flew over or through the power plant building, the glass windows and iron plates vibrated violently. To prevent accidents, the workers kept their bodies low, adjusting the coal, gas, and oil supply to keep the generators running as usual. When they heard that gun cleaning cloths were needed on the fifth floor, running stock worker Liang Fengchang quickly got up and took a new handkerchief from his pocket to hand it up.

　　III. Three Hundred Bullets
　　Now, the eight brave soldiers on the fifth floor had a total of only three hundred bullets and five hand grenades.
　　They were commanders and fighters of the Fourth Company, Second Battalion, First Regiment of a certain unit of the Northeast People's Liberation Army. After gloriously completing their northern line combat missions, their unit was ordered to launch a surprise attack on the western suburbs of Beiping and strike directly at Fengtai. The First Regiment completed the guarding mission in the southeast of the western suburban airport on the 14th and continued to advance eastward. On the morning of the 15th, they arrived at Gucheng Village, eight miles east of Shijingshan, to rest. The Fourth Company was responsible for guarding the west. Soon, they received an order from the management department to launch a tentative offensive to the west. At that time, the Kuomintang army guarding Xin'an Town, the steel factory, and the power plant northwest of Gucheng Village were mostly enemies who had recently fled in defeat and had retreated to this place from Mentougou a day or two ago to catch their breath. After suffering a surprise attack, they collapsed without any resistance. The Kuomintang army stationed at the steel factory and power plant fled in panic to Shijingshan, which backed onto the two factories, while the enemy stationed in Beixin'an Town and at the railway loading and unloading team opposite the power plant scurried up Siping Mountain to the west. At this time, the Fourth Company divided into several groups to pursue the fleeing enemy and seized a great deal of equipment. The ten soldiers led by political instructor Wang Shizhen were too aggressive and far from the main force. When they bypassed the power plant, passed through Guangningfen Village (the power plant's northern workers' dormitory) and charged straight to the foot of Siping Mountain, the enemy realized that the number of people pursuing them was very small. They sent a detachment down the mountain to counterattack, while the main force circled east from Black Mountain to retake the steel factory and Beixin'an Town. At this time, the First Regiment was ordered to move south to take Fengtai urgently, and Wang Shizhen and his ten soldiers were left in the enemy's rear. In the battle with the enemy attacking from the foot of Siping Mountain, soldier Ma Tiezhuangzi bravely sacrificed his life, and soldier Li Sheng was wounded in the left forehead. Seeing the critical situation, the political instructor sent platoon leader Geng Zhongli back to make contact, but he did not receive a response for a long time. He then took soldier Li Sheng back to make contact again. When they reached the foot of Black Mountain in the northeast of the power plant, they met Geng Zhongli, who was blocked by enemy fire. Unable to advance or retreat, the three of them chose the power plant building as a base to persist in the struggle behind enemy lines. Soon, among the brave soldiers who remained at the foot of Siping Mountain waiting for reinforcements, platoon leader Yu Changfu was shot in the arm, and Squad Leader Zhu Ming was captured while trying to make contact to the rear. Only combat team leader Meng Qingshan and soldiers Sun Changren, He Yulin, and Chi Fengshan were left able to fight with guns. Under the enemy's frenzied firing, they had to retreat, climb over several walls, cross a stretch of open ground, and finally arrived at the high building of the power plant.
　　Seizing the opportunity, political instructor Wang Shizhen conducted a combat mobilization. He solemnly said to everyone, "Comrades! We have penetrated deep into the enemy's rear and lost contact with the rear. The enemy has seen that we are few in number and has surrounded us on all sides. Don't panic, everyone. We must be even more calm in times of crisis. Now that we have occupied a superior position, we have decided to persist here to the end!" Every word and every sentence of Wang Shizhen hit the soldiers' hearts and became an invincible force. After a slight pause, Wang Shizhen continued, "We are soldiers of Mao Zedong, we must persist to the last person and the last bullet, and we must continue to fight. We have confidence that our army will come soon."
　　Finally, Wang Shizhen issued a call to Communist Party members Yu Changfu, Geng Zhongli, and Sun Changren, "We are Communist Party members. The noble qualities of a Communist Party member can only be tested in the most critical moments."
　　The response was also a firm voice:
　　"We fight together, we will never bow our heads!"
　　……………………………
　　Based on the principle of "saving bullets and hitting the enemy with every shot," the combat assignments were completed, and Wang Shizhen began to tell stories of our army's heroic breakthrough in the Maolin Incident and the stubborn defense of Siping Street by a platoon for three days and three nights. The soldiers were quietly listening to the stories of the heroic deeds of the People's Liberation Army, which were personally experienced by the political instructor, who was a veteran of the Third Division of the New Fourth Army, when the sentry suddenly issued a warning:
　　"Attention! A group of enemies is coming from the northeast, about a small company of people!"

　　IV. Sharpshooters
　　Just as a company of Kuomintang soldiers moved to the gate of the power plant, political instructor Wang Shizhen shot down the leader with two shots, and with another shot, he neatly shot through the waist of the Kuomintang soldier who had rushed into the guard post. At this time, an indescribable chaos began in the Kuomintang army. They couldn't even tell the direction, and they curled up and huddled at the base of the outer wall of the factory. Only when they were killed again when they entered the factory for the second time and discovered that the bullets were being fired from the tall blockhouse did they think that their own people had made a mistake, so they used semaphore to communicate. But just as the confused signalman crossed his hands, a bullet had already passed through his chest, and the flag fell.
　　When the Kuomintang army (including his gate guard) who had previously been stationed in the power plant fled to Shijingshan in a panic, their pig-like special service chief was left behind, hiding in the old Kuomintang army "headquarters" at the site of the clinic on the right rear of the factory building. Hearing the gunfire at this time, he also poked his head out tentatively. Before he had walked to the open space inside the factory gate, a bullet grazed his left ear, and he hurriedly shrank back. When he went out for the second time, another bullet whizzed over his head.
　　"What's going on?" The special service chief carefully detoured to the power plant director's office and questioned Yu Yunhai, "There must be rioters here! How can you not know that the Eighth Route Army has entered the factory?" He also asked, "Where is the cellar?" Yu Yunhai, the power plant engineer and deputy director whose home was in the Northeast Liberated Area, replied, "Power generation is my responsibility, guarding is your business. How would I know what troops have entered the factory!"
　　After a while, another group of Kuomintang soldiers came from the foot of Siping Mountain in the northwest. As they walked to a pile of rubble about 100 meters away from the gate of the power plant, a bullet shot down from the factory building, killing the leader. Then, a second bullet broke the leg bone of another Kuomintang soldier. The remaining enemies staggered and rolled to the base of the railway and fled back along the original route.
　　After another while, the Kuomintang army huddled outside the factory wall plucked up their courage and sent two people into the factory to force the workers to carry their wounded soldiers. The bullets on the fifth floor came to rescue the workers, whizzing past the two Kuomintang soldiers, scaring the two fellows to flee out of the factory desperately. Some of the remaining Kuomintang soldiers huddled outside the wall saw that the situation was not good and also scurried towards the steel factory.

　　V. Mystery
　　For the Kuomintang army, this was truly a mystery! On that factory building, where the generator had never stopped running, what kind of people had drilled in to shoot down, and with such accurate marksmanship?!
　　At about 2:00 p.m., Liu, the regimental commander of the Shijingshan defending enemy, sent his most capable men to the power plant to find out what was going on. When the battalion commander sent by the Kuomintang army regimental commander entered the director's office from the east side door of the power plant via a small path, he pointed his command knife at Yu Yunhai murderously and said:
　　"There must be rioters here! How can you not know that the Eighth Route Army has entered the factory?"
　　Yu Yunhai shrugged his shoulders in disgust and walked to the outer office, saying coldly:
　　"I am the director of this factory, and power generation is my duty. As for guarding, it is the matter of your sentries. If you don't know who came in, how would we know!"
　　The fellow had nothing to say in response, so he had to put away his command knife and left helplessly.
　　The Kuomintang army headquarters of the steel factory called repeatedly to ask, but the people they sent to the power plant never figured out the truth of the matter. Anxious, they forcibly grabbed people everywhere to lead them upstairs. The workers and staff downstairs all quietly hid. When the old gatekeeper Zhao Huating was forced to lead the Kuomintang army upstairs to investigate, as if it had been agreed upon beforehand, the brave soldier guarding the stairs fired a shot at the wall, and the old man Zhao took advantage of the situation to fall from the not-so-high steps, bleeding from his head, shouting "Help!" The Kuomintang army dared not take another step at the stairwell.

　　VI. Sleepless Night
　　At night, the power plant's offices were crowded with Kuomintang army officers and soldiers. The power plant workers, who had been forced by the Kuomintang army to stop work before dark, scattered and took shelter in the old factory building behind the main building. The old worker Wang Wenbin in the tool room was racking his brains, but he could not find a good route for the eight brave soldiers to break through downstairs, and he was secretly anxious. The eight brave soldiers on the fifth floor were also nervously and calmly monitoring all the enemy's movements. They moved large coal blocks to the windows and stairwells, preparing to use them if necessary. At 9:00 p.m., political instructor Wang Shizhen decided to scout the situation and asked a soldier to go to the roof to observe the surrounding movements by moonlight. He himself quietly went down to the duty room on the third floor to make a phone call downstairs. At this time, a young Kuomintang soldier was dozing in the telephone room. Hearing the phone ring, he picked up the receiver in a daze.
　　"Hello! Who are you?" the phone asked.
　　"I, I, I am a soldier of the National Army!" the Kuomintang soldier replied.
　　Asked: "What are you doing now? Are you asleep?"
　　Answer: "No!"
　　Asked: "How many people are here?"
　　Answer: "A platoon of people!"
　　When he knew that the phone call was coming from upstairs, he seemed to be possessed, and he hurriedly dropped the receiver and ran away.
　　At 11:00 p.m., gunfire was heard from the east, which soon subsided. It turned out that another unit of the Northeast People's Liberation Army was making a tentative offensive towards Shijingshan and then withdrew due to unfavorable terrain. The eight brave soldiers listened quietly to all of this, exchanging mutually concerned and encouraging glances in silence. At this time, the residual heat left over from the machine's operation had been taken away by the cold wind of the winter night, and the factory building upstairs was as cold as an ice palace. The brave soldiers snuggled together to keep warm. The platoon leader who was wounded in the arm was constantly walking back and forth to alleviate the pain of the wound, helping the sentry monitor the enemy. The political instructor held the handle of the gun tightly, reminding everyone from time to time: "The later it gets, the more we must not be careless. We must be responsible to the revolution and to our own lives!" In order to persist for a long time, he had them save even the bucket of oily water that the workers used to wash their hands, and even every drop of everyone's urine, preparing to use them to quench their thirst when they had no other choice.
　　Looking, looking at that factory building standing straight in the heart of the Kuomintang army like a mystery, its huge black shadow seemed to be expanding more and more in the night of the cold winter. The Kuomintang army sentries' hearts contracted, and they quietly and quietly retreated into the house.
　　"Damn it, a strange phenomenon, he's coming to stand guard in the room!" The Kuomintang army battalion commander surnamed Zhao flew into a rage. After chasing his guards out, he continued to pace back and forth in the director's office, muttering anxiously to himself, "How could such a good place be occupied by them?!" After a while, he walked over and asked Director Yu, "How are the workers in the factory?" After a while, he asked again, "How is the staff's thinking?" When he heard Director Yu say that the employees were all good, he seemed a little relieved. But after a while, he walked over again and asked, "Why are they so familiar with it? They went to the roof as soon as they came!" Director Yu said, "That's right! Why are they so familiar with it? I'm afraid there are people inside who used to work here, right?" The battalion commander felt that what he said made a lot of sense, nodded in agreement, and continued to pace.
　　At this time, there was a sudden panic in the outer office. The Kuomintang army battalion commander thought that the People's Liberation Army had come in to attack the camp from inside and outside. When he rushed out in a panic, he realized that one of the soldiers he had brought had fallen from the table while dozing off, thinking that he had eaten the hand grenades of the eight brave soldiers and shouted for help, scaring all the Kuomintang army in the room awake. Everyone panicked for a while, and then they were silent for a while. The battalion commander surnamed Zhao helplessly scolded the soldier and then returned to the director's office. In order to get through the long night, he would wake up the power plant director Yu Yunhai, who was dozing off beside him, from time to time by asking some questions. When he asked if there was anything to eat and drink upstairs, Yu told him that there was nothing. He seemed to be saved and began to talk at length about his "siege tactics." He said:
　　"As long as you trap them for three to five days, they will collapse without a fight"!
　　"This is a good idea!" Director Yu unconditionally expressed his "support." He knew that the People's Liberation Army would come soon, and the so-called siege was all empty talk. After saying that, he fell asleep again in a daze.
　　As dawn broke, another large army of the Northeast People's Liberation Army was advancing towards Shijingshan from all directions. The first shell landed on the Kuomintang army's bunker on the top of Siping Mountain. When the power plant workers were awakened by the sound of gunfire, the Kuomintang army battalion commander who boasted about "siege tactics" had long since slipped away.

　　VII. Victorious Reunion
　　On the morning of the 16th, hearing the increasingly dense gunfire around them, the eight brave soldiers knew that their main force was approaching.
　　At 6:00 a.m., Siping Mountain was completely captured by the People's Liberation Army. At 8:00 a.m., the battle to capture Black Mountain officially began. Black Mountain, 500 meters northeast of the fifth floor, was the highest commanding point in the Shijingshan area for the enemy. The eight brave soldiers were closely watching it, seeking every opportunity to cooperate with the main force in combat. When the first and second shells of the People's Liberation Army landed on the top of Black Mountain from the north, the Kuomintang army on Black Mountain hurriedly circled to the south side of the mountain ridge to hide. At this time, they happened to fall within the firing range of the eight brave soldiers. When the enemy moved to the west side again, the two machine guns of another People's Liberation Army unit occupying Siping Mountain were waiting for them on the Second Ridge.
　　Seeing that the third and fourth shells of the People's Liberation Army sharpshooters accurately hit the bunkers, almost completely destroying the Kuomintang army's positions on the top of Black Mountain, the enemy at the foot of the mountain panicked and hurriedly sent a company of people up the mountain to reinforce them. Political instructor Wang Shizhen saw that the time had come, picked up the submachine gun, and fired a volley of bullets at the enemies going up the mountain, stopping them halfway up the mountain, hesitating. Later, a platoon of enemy soldiers rushed up, and political instructor Wang Shizhen aimed at the enemy carrying the artillery mount and knocked him down with two shots. At this time, a shell fired from the north by our army landed in the middle of the Kuomintang army, hitting them so hard that people and cannons flew and rolled down the mountainside. Except for a small number who circled to the west side of the power plant and stubbornly resisted in the cinder heap behind the factory building, most of the remaining Kuomintang army were captured by Du Ying of a certain unit of our People's Liberation Army. The battle of Black Mountain ended like this.
　　At 2:00 p.m., the eight brave soldiers and the liberating army who entered the Shijingshan area victoriously reunited. When Company Commander Wang took over the defense from the eight brave soldiers and cleared out the Kuomintang army remaining in the cinder heap behind the power plant, only a force isolated on the top of Shijingshan was left, waiting for the final blow from our army.
　　At night, a young worker led the People's Liberation Army quietly around the power grid and took a small road to clear out completely the few enemies remaining on the top of Shijingshan. The rest of the enemies who fled south were all captured by another unit of our People's Liberation Army.
　　On the morning of the 17th, when the sun rose, the Shijingshan area had been completely liberated. The workers made the chimneys smoke with the highest efficiency, and countless heroic ranks of the People's Liberation Army passed through the avenue next to the chimneys, pointing towards Beiping.

　　占领石景山发电厂的八勇士
    本报记者展潮
    在解放北平西郊发电厂与钢铁厂所在地石景山之战中，东北人民解放军某部八勇士与发电厂许多工人职员，曾经进行了英勇而机智的配合，使石景山的重要企业未遭任何损失，转入人民之手。
　　一、深入到发电厂
    十五日上午九点钟，石景山发电厂的职工们，在激烈的枪声已现疏落时，发现沿着东北方黑山脚下走来了三个军人。
    “喂，那是八路！”正在发电厂厂房第五层楼上了望的工人韩湘才，经过一番判别之后，他确定那三个人是人民解放军。这，立时引起和他在一起了望的工友赵吉恒和助理工程师张仁杰底注意。但是，在国民党军碉堡重重的腹心地带，看不到大队人民解放军，这几个解放军又是从那里来的呢？大家正半信半疑，忽然山头上的国民党军向下撩了一炮，炮弹正落在那三个人的三角队形中间，三个人稍一隐蔽，便又敏捷地利用炮弹扬起的烟尘，继续向前跃进。这时，职工们已清楚看到三个人的服装，都不约而同地说：“真的是八路！”而那位抗日战争时期在山海关（临榆）华商柳江煤矿公司做工，就常和八路军游击队常来往的赵吉恒，更补添了一句：
    “只要看动作，就知道是他们！”
    说话之间，人民解放军的三位勇士，已跃进了发电厂的大门，分别在三个碉堡后面隐蔽起来。看到没有什么动静，为首那位拿斯登手提式的勇士，便试探着向厂里的高楼前进，当他机警地走进厂房顺着楼梯上升时，遇见了工人张文奎，打听“楼上有没有国民党（指国民党军）？”张文奎说：“没有！”那位勇士迅速地观察了地形，又顺着楼梯向下疾降，打算仍回楼下封索敌人，当他在楼梯口碰见工务员沈根才，确实知道厂楼里此刻上下都没有敌人时，便一股劲地登上了第五层楼，在一个适当的窗户跟前安排好自己的枪。这时，守卫在大门口岗楼后侧的二位勇士，也顺着同一路线，闪电似地走上楼去了。
    二、楼上楼下
    “八路军上楼”的消息，秘密地在发电厂的职工中传播着。连在大楼后面旧厂房里做工的一些老工人也知道了。杨清春说：“听说都来了”！李凤鸣纠正着说：“才三四个人，这阵全上了五楼！”“真有种！”人们正兴奋地谈论着，工务员沈根才在门口出现了，他转告工厂战时防护委员会一句话给大家：“对机器和楼上的人，大家不要乱出主意”。人们会意地点点头，依旧忙碌地照料着运转着的机器和锅炉。
    这时候，助理工程师张仁杰，已经把三勇士引到全厂最高的五楼上下来，又忽然想起后面进来的两位解放军中的一个左额受了伤，应该上去招呼他敷药，便又轻轻地重新登上五楼，半点过后，工务员沈根才和工人王振玉端着烙饼，提着开水上楼，职工们早已耽心着勇士们的饥渴，把自己的午膳尽先送上给勇士们吃。
    工务员沈根才第二次上来时，那位最先上楼的勇士和挂望镜的连指导员，抱歉似地告他说，我们又来了五位同志，希望沈根才再帮忙弄点吃喝的东西，并且和气地问沈，能不能把煤粉炉运煤机那根正在上下转动着的橡皮带停下来？因为楼的前部地方太狭小，一不小心，很可能给带子挂到煤槽里去，而且机器声响太大，妨碍他们的视线与听觉，请沈下去和工厂负责人商量，十分钟后，那根橡皮带把最后一批煤块运上来，便静静地躺在勇士们的跟前了。
    这时盘踞在发电厂东北和西北方黑山和四平山上的国民党军，大概因为被早上一场战斗弄昏了，现在还遗悸未已，不时向山下盲无目的地扫射，流弹在发电厂大楼上飞过或穿过时，玻璃窗和铁板剧烈的震动着。为了防止意外，工人们便把身体压得低低的，调节煤量、气量和加油，使发电机照常运转。当听到五楼上要擦枪布时，运行股工人梁凤昌赶紧爬起来，从口袋里掏出一条新手帕递了上去。
    三、三百发子弹
    现在，登在五楼上的八位勇士，一共只有三百发子弹，五颗手榴弹了。
    他们是东北人民解放军某部一团二营四连的指战员。他们部队光荣地完成了北线作战任务后，即奉命奇袭北平西郊，直捣丰台。一团于十四日完成西郊飞机场东南方警戒任务，继续向东进军，十五日清晨抵石景山东八里的古城村休息，四连在西面担任警戒，不久又接到管部命令向西作试探性进攻。当时据守古城村西北辛安镇，钢铁厂和发电厂的，大部是不久前自己先败逃下来，一二日前又自门头沟撤至这里喘息未定之敌，受到出其不意的袭击，便毫无抵抗地溃散了。驻守钢铁厂及发电厂的国民党军，仓惶撤上两厂背倚着的石景山，住在北辛安镇及发电厂对面铁道装卸队之敌，则狼奔豕突的窜上西面之四平山。这时，四连兵分数路尾追逃敌，缴获极伙，而连指导员王世珍这一路十个人，因为冲得太猛，和大队离得很远，当他们绕过发电厂，穿过广宁坟村（发电厂北工人宿舍）直冲至四平山下，敌人才发现原来追击他们部队的人数甚少，便以一部下山反扑，大部则自黑山迂回向东，下山重占钢铁厂和北辛安镇。而此时一团奉命全部南开急取丰台，王指导员等十个人便这样给留在敌人的必腹中了。在与四平山下扑之敌作战中，战士马铁庄子英勇地牺牲了，战士李生左额负伤，连指导员看到处境危急，便派三排副耿忠礼回去联络，很久得不到回音，他便带着战士李生再回去联络，走至发电厂东北黑山脚下，遇见了为敌火力所阻的耿忠礼，三个人既不能向前，也不能向后，便选择了发电厂这座大楼，作为坚持敌人腹心斗争的阵地。不久，在四平山脚下坚守待援的勇士们中，二排副于长富臂膀挂了花，九班长朱明向后联络被俘了，只剩下战斗组长孟清山，战士孙长仁、何玉林、迟凤山四个人能持枪作战。在敌人疯狂的射击下，只得撤退，翻过几重墙，冲过一段开阔地，最后也来到发电厂的高楼上来了。
    抓紧空隙，连指导员王世珍进行战斗动员，他庄严地向大家说：“同志们！我们孤军深入敌人心腹，失掉了后方联系，敌人看破了我们人少，把我们四面全围起来了。大家不要慌，在危急的时候，要更加镇定。现在我们已经占领了优越的地势，我们就决定在这里坚持到底！”王指导员每一个字，每一句话都打到战士们心里，成为一种无敌的力量。稍稍停顿之后，王指导员接着说：“我们是毛泽东的战士，我们要坚持到最后一个人、一颗子弹，还要打下去。我们有信心，我们的军队不久就会打来的。”
    最后，王指导员向共产党员于长富、耿忠礼和孙长仁发出号召：“我们是共产党员。一个共产党员的高贵品质，只有在最危急的时候，才会考验出来。”
    回答他的也是一个坚定的声音：
    “我们战斗在一起，誓死不低头！”
    ……………………………
    在根据“节省子弹，发发命中敌人”的原则下，完成了战斗分工，王指导员便开始讲茂林事变我军奋战突围和四平街战斗中一排人固守三天三夜等故事。战士们正静静地听着这位曾经是新四军第三师老战士的连指导员讲述他所亲身经历的人民解放军英雄史迹，监视哨突然发出了警告：
    “注意！从东北方向来了一股敌人，约莫一小连人！”
    四、神枪手
    国民党军一连人刚运动到发电厂大门口，指导员王世珍两枪便把为首的一个打倒了，再一枪，又端端地把那个抢进岗楼的国民党军底腰干打穿了。这时，国民党军中一种难以形容的混乱开始了，他们连方向都没有辨别出来，就连滚带爬地蜷缩到工厂的外围墙脚下。直等到他们二次进厂再被击毙一个时，发现枪弹是从那座高大的炮楼上发射下来时，他们还以为自己人发生了误会，就使用旗语联络。但当那个糊涂的旗手刚把手交叉起来的时候，他的胸膛已经穿过一颗子弹，连旗倒下了。
    当先前驻守发电厂里的国民党军（连他的门岗在内）仓惶窜上石景山时，他们那位猪也似的特务长却被遗落了，躲在厂房右侧后方的医务所旧址国民党军“连部”里。这时听到枪声，也探头探脑的钻了出来。当他还没有走到工厂大门内那块空地时，一颗子弹从他左耳根掠过，他慌忙缩回。待到第二次出去时，又是一颗从他头上呼啸而过。
    “这是怎么回事？”那位特务长小心地绕道走到发电厂主任办公室里，追问于运海：“是不是八路军进了厂子？”并问：“什么地方有地窖？”而那位家在东北解放区的发电厂工程师兼副主任于运海，却这样回复他说：“发电是我的责任，守卫是你们的事。工厂里进来什么队伍，我怎么知道！”
    过了一阵，从西北方四平山麓又来了一班国民党军，他们刚走到离发电厂大门约一百米远的一堆碎石跟前，一颗子弹从厂楼上射下，正打死为首的一个。接着第二颗子弹又打断了另一个国民党军的腿骨，余下的残敌便踉踉跄跄地滚到铁路基下，循原路逃走了。
    再过一阵，蜷缩在工厂围墙外的国民党军，鼓起勇气派了两个人冲进厂内，强抓工人给他们抬伤兵。五层楼上的子弹便来给工人们解围，嗖嗖地从那两个国民党军身边擦过，吓得那两个家伙拚命飞奔出厂。蜷伏在围墙外的一些残余国民党军，看见形势不妙，也仓惶向钢铁厂方向窜去。
    五、谜
    对于国民党军，这真是个谜！在那座发电机始终没有停止转动的厂楼上，到底钻进了些什么人往下打枪，而且枪法又这么准确？！
    下午二时许，石景山守敌指挥官团长刘某，把自己手下最得力的人派到发电厂来，以探究竟。当国民党军团长派来的营长，绕小道从发电厂东侧门进入主任办公室时，杀气腾腾地用指挥刀逼着于运海说：
    “你们这里一定有暴徒！厂子进了八路，你还能不知道？”
    于运海厌恶地耸耸肩膀，走向外面的大办公室去，冷冷地说：
    “我是这个工厂的主任，发电是我的职责。至于看守，是你们岗哨的事，进来什么人你们都不知道，我们就更无从知道了！”
    说得那家伙无话可对，便只好收下他的指挥刀，莫可奈何地出去了。
    钢铁厂国民党军团部一次又一次地来电话催问，但是他们派来发电厂的人，对事情的真象却始终没有弄清楚。他们焦急之余，便到处强抓人带领他们上楼。楼下的工人职员们都悄悄地躲开了。当看门的老头赵华廷被威逼着领国民党军上楼侦察时，好象是事先就约好了似的，守卫楼梯的勇士朝墙上打的一声枪响，赵老头便趁势从不高几层梯阶上跌下来，流了一头血，直喊：“救命！”吓得国民党军再也不敢迈上楼梯口一步。
    六、不眠之夜
    入夜，发电厂的办公室里，横七竖八地拥塞着一些国民党军官兵。天黑前被国民党军所迫停止工作的发电厂职工，散在大楼后旧厂房下掩蔽休息，正在工具室里的老工人王文斌，左思右想，总找不到给八勇士一条下楼突围的好路径，暗暗地在着急。五层楼上的八位勇士，也紧张而沉着地，监视着敌人一切动静，他们把大煤块搬到窗户和楼梯口上，准备必要时使用。夜晚九点钟，指导员王世珍决定侦察一下情况，让一位战士上到楼顶，利用月色观察四下动静。他自己轻轻地下到三楼的值班室内，向楼下打电话。这时，一个年青的国民党军正在电话室里打盹，听到电话铃响，便胡里胡涂地拿起听筒。
    “喂！你是什么人？”电话里问。
    “我，我，我是国军！”国民党军答。
    问：“你们现在干什么？睡觉了没有？”
    答：“没有！”
    问：“你们这里有多少人？”
    答：“一排人！”
    当他知道电话是从楼上打下来时，象中魔似的，连忙撩下听筒，抽腿就跑。
    夜十一时，听见东方有枪炮声，不久又转沉寂。原来是另一部东北人民解放军向石景山方向作试探性进攻，后因地形不利撤走了。八勇士静静地倾听着这一切，在沉默中交换着同志间互相关切、互相激励的眼光。这时候，机器转动时留下来的余温，已被冬夜的寒风带走了，厂房楼上象一座冰宫那样寒冷，勇士们互相偎倚着取暖，那位臂膀负伤的二排副为了减轻伤口的疼痛，不断地来回走动，帮着哨兵监视敌人。连指导员紧握着枪柄，时时提醒大家：“天越晚，越不能疏忽，要对革命负责，要对自己的生命负责！”为了长久地坚持，他让把工人洗手的那桶油水甚至每个人每滴尿都保存下来。准备不得已时用来解渴。
    望着，望着那座矗然直立在国民党军腹心中谜也似的厂楼，它的巨大的黑影，在寒冬的夜色里，似乎愈来愈加扩大了，国民党军哨兵的心都收缩了，悄悄地悄悄地退进屋子里。
    “他妈的，怪现象，上屋里站岗来了！”那位姓赵的国民党军营长大发雷霆，把他的卫兵撵出去后，继续在主任办公室里踱来踱去，焦灼地自言自语说：“这样好的地方，怎么叫人家占了？！”一忽，走过来问于主任：“厂里工人怎么样？”一忽，又问，“职员思想怎么样？”听到于主任说员工都不错时，他似乎有点放心了。但是过了一会，他又走过来问：“他们为什么这样熟悉？一来就上到楼顶！”于主任说：“就是啊！他们为什么这样熟悉呢？恐怕里头有过去在这里做过事的人吧（？）”那个营长觉得这话说得很有道理，同意地点点头，又继续踱他的方步。
    这时候，外间大办公室突然传来一阵惊慌的闹声，国民党军营长以为人民解放军里应外合进来摸营，当他慌忙奔出去时，才知道是他带的一群士兵中的一个，打盹时从桌上跌下来，自以为是吃了八勇士的手榴弹，大叫救命，把全屋的国民党军都吓醒了，大家惊慌了一阵，然后又互静了一阵。姓赵的营长无可奈何地，把那个小兵臭骂之后，便又回到主任办公室里。为了渡过这漫漫的长夜，不时提些问题，去搅醒在他身边打盹的那位发电厂主任于运海。当他问到楼上有没有吃的和喝的东西时，于告诉他说什么都没有，他便象得救了似的，大讲特讲起他的“围困战法”来了。他说：
    “只要困上三五天，不打自垮”！
    “这个办法好！”于主任无条件地表示“拥护”，他知道，人民解放军大军不久就会来的，所谓围困，全是空话，说罢，又昏昏地睡去。
    天色黎明，东北人民解放军另一部大军正自各方面向石景山推进。第一颗炮弹正落在四平山顶国民党军的碉堡上，当发电厂的职工们被炮声惊醒时，那个吹嘘“围困战术”的国民党军营长，早已不知道溜到那里去了。
    七、胜利会师
    十六日早晨，听到四周愈来愈密的炮声，八勇士知道自己的大军已经接近了。
    六点钟，四平山完全被人民解放军攻克了。八点钟，攻取黑山的战斗正式开始。五层楼东北五百米就是黑山。黑山是敌人在石景山区最高制高点，八勇士便紧紧地盯着它，寻求一切机会，配合大军作战。当人民解放军第一、第二颗炮弹自北面落到黑山头时，黑山上的国民党军便慌忙绕到山梁南侧躲藏，这时正好落在八勇士射界里。当敌人再往西侧转移时，另一部占领四平山人民解放军的两挺机枪，正在二道山上等待着他们。
    看到人民解放军神炮手第三、第四颗炮弹端端地打在碉堡里，把国民党军在黑山头上的阵地几乎全部摧毁时，山下的敌人着了慌，连忙派一连多人上山增援。王世珍指导员见时机已到，便把那挺冲锋枪端起来，照着上山的敌人就是一梭子弹，把敌人阻止在山腰上，踌躇不定，后来一排敌军强冲上去，王世珍指导员便瞅准那个抬炮座的敌军，两枪便把他撩倒了。正在这个时候，我大军自山北射来的一颗炮弹，正落在那群国民党军中间，打得他们人飞炮翻，从山腰上滚下来，残余国民党军除小部绕至发电厂西侧进至厂楼后侧的炉灰堆里顽抗之外，大部被我人民解放军某部杜营俘虏了。黑山头的战斗，就这样结束了。
    下午二时，八勇士和进入石景山地区的解放大军胜利会师了。当王连长接过八勇士的防务，把残留在发电厂后面炉灰堆上的国民党军肃清时，只剩下一股孤悬在石景山头上的敌人，等待我大军最后的一击了。
    夜晚，一个青年工人领着人民解放军悄悄地绕过电网，从一条小路抄上去，把残留在石景山顶上的少数敌人完全肃清，余下一部向南遁逃的敌人，全部为我另一部人民解放军俘获。
    十七日早晨，当太阳升起来的时候，石景山地区已全部解放，职工们以最高的效率使烟囱冒烟，无数人民解放军的英雄行列，从烟囱旁边的大道上穿过，指向北平。
  　一九四八年十二月二十七日于石景山
