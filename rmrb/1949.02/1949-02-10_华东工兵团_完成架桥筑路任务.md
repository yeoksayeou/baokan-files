Xinhua News Agency, East China, 8th. The East China Field Army's engineer regiment actively engaged in bridge building, road construction, and mine sweeping during the Huaihai Campaign, opening up routes for the infantry, artillery, and logistics to advance. In the first and second stages of the campaign, the regiment erected 33 bridges across the Grand Canal, Sha River, Baima River, Old Yellow River, and Xiawan River, totaling 2,292 meters in length. They also repaired 19 important roads, totaling 258 li, and cleared 560 mines. When the Fifth Company was building a bridge in front of Wumiao on the Baima River, thirty-seven bridge builders drove piles in the freezing water. They were so cold that their lips turned purple and they could barely speak, but they persisted in their work. Wang Kaixing and Zhu Huitong of the Third Squad of the Seventh Company were responsible for hammering spikes while constructing the Zhujiawan Bridge. They hammered more than 200 spikes overnight, causing their hands to bleed. The regiment promoted democracy in its work, pooling the wisdom of the masses to overcome various difficulties. For example, when the Third Company was building the large Lu Tang River bridge, the pile driver initially swayed when tied to two boats, making it difficult to drive the piles straight. Later, after everyone's research, they used the already driven piles to tie down the boats, which stabilized the boats, and the piles were driven straight. They took great care of their tools in their work. When the Seventh Company was building a heavy-duty bridge more than 300 meters long at Gaojiaweizi on the Bu Lao River, a hammer fell into the water. Li Lan, the second platoon leader of the platoon, jumped into the cold current three times to retrieve the hammer.

　　华东工兵团
  　完成架桥筑路任务
    【新华社华东八日电】在淮海战役中，华东野战军某部工兵团积极进行架桥、筑路、扫雷，为步兵、炮兵、辎重开辟了前进道路。在战役第一、二阶段，该团于运河、沙河、白马河、旧黄河、下湾河等处架设了桥梁三十三座，共长二千二百九十二公尺，修筑重要道路十九处，计二五八华里，扫雷五六零枚。该团五连在白马河伍庙前架桥时，卅七个架桥者在冰冷的水里打桩，他们冻得嘴唇发紫，话也说不出口，但仍坚持作业。七连三班王开庆和朱会同两人在架设朱家湾桥时，负责上钉，一夜钉完二百多个，把手都震的出了血。该团在工作中发扬民主，集中群众智慧，战胜了各种困难。如三连架陆塘河大桥时，最初绑在两只船上的打桩架子摆动，使桥桩打不正，后经大家研究结果利用已打好的桥桩，系住船身，船身稳固，打桩也就正了。他们在工作中对工具非常爱护。七连在不老河高家围子架设三百余米长的载重桥时，一个铁锤掉在水里，该排二排长李兰三次跳下寒流，把铁锤捞了起来。
