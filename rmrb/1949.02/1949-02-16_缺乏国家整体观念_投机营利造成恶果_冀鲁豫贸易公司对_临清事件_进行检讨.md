Ji-Lu-Yu Telegram: The Ji-Lu-Yu Trading Company conducted a self-criticism regarding the mistakes made by the Taixinglong and Defengyu state-owned stores in the Linqing incident. According to Fan Yongzhong, Deputy Manager of the Ji-Lu-Yu Trading Company: After seeing the news in the People's Daily about the public-owned stores colluding with speculators to disrupt the market amidst the fluctuating cotton prices in Linqing, we immediately notified both stores to conduct self-criticisms, and we also conducted two self-criticisms ourselves. Furthermore, on the 20th, we dispatched the head of the business department to Linqing to participate in meetings and conduct specific investigations. The results of the investigation were as follows: (1) Taixinglong purchased 180,000 jin of cotton from October 10th to the 26th last year, at an average price of 2,600 yuan per jin (冀币, Ji currency). When the company sent people to Liaocheng to inspect work at that time, although they were aware of this matter, they did not stop it. The Defengyu Company's Linqing warehouse began purchasing around the same day, and by the 23rd, it had purchased a total of 70,000 jin (at an average price of 2,500 yuan per jin). Prior to this, the person in charge of the store had twice asked the district company whether they could purchase cotton. Our first response was "absolutely not," and the second response was "purchase is permitted under circumstances that don't affect prices." Later, most of the cotton purchased by Taixinglong was transported to Jinan for sale, while the cotton purchased by the warehouse was stored and not moved. The trading company sent letters twice to stop their purchases: once when the cotton price rose to 260,000 yuan; and once after receiving the Trade Bureau's telegram ordering a halt. This is a simple account of the matter. (2) Our self-criticism and understanding of this issue: From the perspective of organizational discipline, it fully demonstrates a lack of organization and discipline, violating the decision that "cotton is not allowed to be purchased directly, but should be supplied uniformly by the head office according to the needs of each region." This decision was well-known from the district company to the stores; however, in the "Linqing Incident," Taixinglong and Defengyu acted solely out of selfish profit motives, which affected the entire national economy. This not only shows a weak sense of organization and a disregard for this decision but also demonstrates a lack of mass perspective and national perspective. As the country is about to achieve complete victory and the regions are gradually expanding, if selfish and localist ideas persist, it will inevitably affect the construction of the entire people's cause. We have not only made this mistake in the investigation of this problem, but through this incident, we have also linked it to the investigation of many other similar behaviors. These mistakes deserve serious vigilance and correction in the future. (3) From an ideological perspective: This action was dominated by the thought of profiteering, inheriting the speculative nature of old merchants who only pursue profit, and failing to calculate the loss of the entire social wealth. For example, the fluctuation of cotton prices not only severely hit small producers and consumer masses but also caused huge losses to the national treasury due to the adulteration by speculators. The moldy and blackened cotton damaged the credibility of the state-owned trading company, and these losses cannot be calculated by numbers. This also betrays the trust given by the people. The root causes of the above errors are mainly due to a low level of political awareness, insufficient study of policies, and insufficient research on instructions, leading to a fall into vulgar empiricism and a bad tendency of not complying with policies. To overcome this error, we can only improve theory, strengthen policy study, and resolutely oppose disorganization and indiscipline; otherwise, we will not be able to distinguish right from wrong and climb out of the mire. In this self-criticism, most comrades have a good understanding, but some individual comrades do not conduct in-depth self-criticism from a positive perspective, reject criticism, or intentionally or unintentionally avoid the essence of the problem, listing general phenomena; instead of examining themselves with a serious attitude of being responsible to the people, they rejoice in others' misfortunes with the thought that "others are worse than me." In this incident, one of Taixinglong and Defengyu did not ask for instructions, and the other asked for instructions twice before acting. However, the district company, in its leadership, did not stop the former in a timely manner and allowed the latter. Although there are differences in form, they are consistent in thought and substance. Due to the lack of seriousness in leadership thinking and style, and the accommodation and hesitation in implementing resolutions, this is the root cause that leads the led to disorganization and indiscipline. This criticism in the People's Daily has been of great help to us.

### 缺乏国家整体观念　投机营利造成恶果  冀鲁豫贸易公司对“临清事件”进行检讨

　　缺乏国家整体观念
  　投机营利造成恶果
    冀鲁豫贸易公司对“临清事件”进行检讨
    【冀鲁豫电】冀鲁豫贸易公司关于泰兴垄德丰裕公营商店，在临清事件中所犯错误，进行检讨。据冀鲁豫贸易公司副经理范永中称：我们见到人民日报载临清棉价波动中，公营商店结合投机商人捣乱市场的新闻后，除立即分别通知两店令其作检讨外，我们也作了两次检讨。又于二十日派业务科长赴临清参加会议，进行具体检查。检查结果为：（一）泰兴隆于去年十月十日开始至廿六日止，购棉十八万斤，平均每斤合价二千六百元（冀币下同）。当时公司派人赴聊城检查工作时，虽了解此事，但未制止。德丰裕公司临清仓库于当日左右开始购买，至廿三日，共购入七万斤（平均每斤二千五百元）。事先该店负责人曾两次请示区公司是否可以购棉，我们第一次的答复是“坚决不买”，第二次的答复是“在不影响物价的情况下，可以购买。”以后泰兴隆所购棉花，大部运济南出售，仓库所购都存放未动。贸易公司曾在其购买当中，两次去信制止：一次是于棉价上涨至二十六万时；一次是于接贸总电令停止后去信制止。这是事情的简单经过。（二）我们对此问题的检讨和认识：从组织观念上检查，是充分表现了无组织无纪律、违犯“棉花不准直接购买，由总公司根据各区需要统一供给”的决定，这一决定从区公司到商店，是尽人皆知的；但泰兴隆、德丰裕在“临清事件”中，只从自私营利出发，影响了整个的国民经济，这就不仅是表现了组织观念薄弱，轻视这个决定，同时更表现了是缺乏群众观念和国家观念。处于全国即将胜利之际，地区日渐扩大，若仍存有自私和地方主义的观念，则势必影响整个人民事业的建设。我们不仅在检查这个问题上犯此错误，并通过这个事件又联系检查到其他不少问题，也是类似的行为。这些错误是值得今后严重警惕和纠正的。（三）从思想上来检查：这次行动是受了营利思想的支配，因袭旧商人唯利是图的投机性，未计算到整个社会财富的损失。如此次棉价波动，不只严重地打击了小生产者和消费群众，而且由于投机商人的掺假使水，使国库受到了巨大的损失。并因棉花发霉变黑，而损害了国营贸易公司的信用，这些损失绝不是数字可以胜计的。这也就辜负了人民所给予的委托。以上错误产生的原因，主要是由于政治水平不高，对政策学习、对指示研究不够，以致陷入庸俗的经验主义，陷入不遵守政策的恶劣倾向之中。想要克服这种错误，只有从提高理论，加强政策学习，坚决反对无组织无纪律，否则就无法分清是非，爬出泥潭。我们此次的检讨，绝大部分同志的认识是好的，但尚有个别同志，不从正面作深刻地检讨，拒绝批评，或有意无意的避开问题的本质，罗列一般现象；不是以严肃的对人民负责的态度去检查自己，而是以“别人比我更糟”的想法，幸灾乐祸。这个事件中，泰兴隆与德丰裕，一个是不经请示，一个是两度请示而后行动的。但区公司在领导上，对前者未加及时制止，对后者又予以允许。从形式上看，虽有不同，但在思想上和实质上是一致的。由于领导思想和作风上的不严肃，对执行决议的迁就犹豫，这就是使被领导者走向无组织无纪律的根源。此次人民日报的这种批评，对我们帮助很大。
