　　Vinegar and Oil are Daily Necessities
　　Assistance Can Be Provided According to Policy
Editor:
　　I run a vinegar and oil shop in Wucheng County and serve as the group leader for the trade association. Because all businesses in the trade are small-scale, and in accordance with the upper-level policy of developing industry and commerce for mass production, I planned to borrow some money from the Jinnan Bank. However, the bank said, "Your vinegar and oil are consumables and should not be developed," and refused to lend. Therefore, all the businesses in our trade came to me to discuss this situation, saying that vinegar, oil, and pickles are necessities for everyone, so how can they be called consumables? Making vinegar and oil requires labor, and it should be judged based on industrial standards. Please discuss this in your newspaper and provide an answer.

Answer:
　　1. Those engaged in brewing vinegar and oil are classified as handicrafts; those who sell them are classified as commerce; those who brew and sell their own products are generally considered handicrafts.
　　2. Regarding whether banks should provide loans for assistance, according to our policy, assistance can be provided, but it is not necessary for banks to provide loans. The amount of bank loans is limited and cannot be provided to every handicraft industry.
　　3. Vinegar and oil should be considered daily necessities for the people.

### 醋油是日用必需品　按照政策可以扶助

专栏：询问与答复

　　醋油是日用必需品
  　按照政策可以扶助编辑同志：
    我在武城县开醋油铺，充当同业组长。兹因同业都是小本营业，按着上级政策发展工商业大量生产，打算去冀南银行贷点款。但该银行谈：“你这醋、油乃是消耗品，不应当发展。”不贷给。因此本行各家来找我接谈这情形，都说本行醋、油、咸菜是人人离不开的，从何处称为消耗品呢？作醋作油都要用劳动力，应当以工业为标准才正确。请贵社讨论后，在报纸上答复。
  　　　　　　　　　　　醋油业同业组长孙耀
    答：一、醋油业从事酿造者，称手工业；贩卖者称商业；自己酿造同时又出卖自己酿造的成品者，一般应按手工业论。
    二、银行是否应贷款扶助问题，按我们的政策，可以扶助，但不一定要银行贷款去扶助，银行贷款数目有限，不能对一个手工业都贷款。
    三、醋油应算为人民日用必需品。
