　　Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 12th. The scheme of the American imperialists to instigate France to support the restoration of the Vietnamese King Bao Dai has been denounced by the "Vietnam-America Friendship Association" in New York. In a statement issued on the 8th, the association's chairman, Du Ren (transliteration), pointed out that this is a step taken by the imperialist countries in their desperate struggle against the Vietnamese people, but it is destined to fail in the face of the power of the people. He said: We want a free Vietnam, we want our own army and diplomacy, and these things cannot be obtained from Bao Dai. Du Ren reminded the Americans that, with the support of imperialist countries, one puppet government after another has appeared in Vietnam. All these guys collapsed because they could not get the support of the people; if Bao Dai comes back, "it will be no different." Du Ren went on to reveal that the French government, with the support of the United States, has spent 670 million US dollars on war expenses in Vietnam in the past two years, including a large amount of funds allocated to France by the US Economic Cooperation Administration. Du Ren finally declared that the Vietnamese people's struggle against the new conspiracy of the imperialist countries will be fully supported by the "Vietnam Friendship Association."

　　纽约“越美友谊协会”声明
  　斥责美法对越新阴谋
    【新华社陕北十二日电】美帝国主义者策动法国扶植越南庆王保大复辟的计谋，受到纽约的“越美友谊协会”的申斥。该会主席杜仁（译音）于八日发表的声明中，指出这是帝国主义国家在对越南人民进行绝望斗争中的一个步骤，但它在人民的力量面前注定要失败。他说：我们要一个自由的越南，我们要有自己的军队和外交，这些东西均不能从保大那里得到。杜仁提醒美国人说：在帝国主义国家扶持之下，越南曾出现过一个又一个的傀儡政府。所有这些家伙，均因无法取得人民的支持而垮台；如果保大回来的话，“也不会有两样”。杜仁继揭露法国政府在美方支持下，过去两年内，已在越南开支战费六亿七千万美元，其中包括美国经合总署拨给法国的大批款项。杜仁最后宣称：越南人民对付帝国主义国家新阴谋的斗争，将受到“越南友谊协会”的全力支持。
