Discussing the Central Committee's Decision on Women's Work
　　Women's Congresses Convened in Various Parts of North China
　　Determined to Mobilize and Organize Women to Actively Produce and Support the Front
　　Shi Jiazhuang Elects Comrade Deng Yingchao to Attend the National Women's Congress
　　[Reported by this newspaper] In response to the call to convene the National Women's Congress and the North China Women's Congress, administrative regions, provinces, and cities in North China have successively convened women's congresses. All localities made full preparations beforehand. In January, counties and districts in the four special districts of Beiyue (now merged with Hebei-Rehe-Liaoning to form Chahar Province) convened county and district women's congresses to review work, discuss proposals, and elect representatives. Taiyuan, Hebei-Shandong-Henan and other regions held meetings of women cadres before the congresses to carry out various preparations for the congresses. The Taihang Women's Federation issued a call, asking women throughout the region to continue the glorious achievements of participating in various struggles in the past, actively participate in production and construction to support the national liberation war, and greet the National Women's Congress with practical actions. The Taiyue District Women's Congress first opened on February 1. In the twenty-odd days until the closing of the Shijiazhuang City Women's Congress on February 21, women's congresses were held successively in Taihang, Jinzhong, Jizhong, Jinan, Chahar, Hebei-Shandong-Henan and other places. Many of the representatives attending the Women's Congresses were heroic models in industrial and agricultural production and support for the front, support for the army, preferential treatment for military families, and joining the army.

　　At the women's congresses in various places, the experiences and achievements of women's work in the past were summarized. Over the past ten years, under the leadership of the Communist Party and the democratic government, women in the North China Liberated Areas have played an active role in supporting the front, production, land reform, and other aspects. A large number of heroic models have emerged. For example, when Chen and Xie's army crossed the Yellow River to the south in 1947, men in some areas of Taiyue followed the army to support the front, and women replaced men in hoeing seedlings and harvesting autumn crops; in the three counties of Jiyuan, Yangcheng, and Jincheng in Taiyue District alone, women made more than 526,000 pairs of military shoes in the past three years. During the Jinzhong Campaign, women in Yuci, Taigu, Pingyao, Qingyuan, Xugou, Jiaocheng and other six counties in Jinzhong (part of which were new districts) made great contributions, milling more than 5 million jin of flour and making 120,000 pairs of military shoes alone. Various localities conveyed and discussed the "Decision on the Current Work of Rural Women in Liberated Areas" of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China, and formulated specific guidelines and plans for each region based on this spirit and the specific conditions of each region. At the women's congresses in Chahar Province and Jinzhong and other places, it was decided that the central task of women's work at present is to mobilize and organize the vast number of women to actively participate in labor production and support the front. Taking production as the center, cultural and political education should be combined, and women's special problems should be solved consciously and step by step. Implement the marriage policy, protect women's interests, mobilize women to participate in democratic construction and various social activities, improve the organization of women's federations and women's representative conferences at all levels, and combine the work of breaking superstitions and doing a good job in maternal and child hygiene. Other localities have also formulated specific plans. At the same time, the women's congresses in various regions also produced the leading organs of the women's movement in each region—the Women's Federation, and elected representatives to attend the North China Women's Congress and the National Women's Congress. Comrade Deng Yingchao, the current deputy director of the National Democratic Women's Federation Preparatory Committee and a national women's leader, and Comrade Kang Keqing, were elected by the women's congresses in Shijiazhuang and Taiyue as representatives to attend the National Women's Congress. Responsible comrades of the local CCP committees personally came to guide the representative congresses, and put forward specific opinions on the direction and tasks of the local women's movement in connection with the current victorious situation. Based on the situation in various places and the requirements of the broad masses of women, the representatives fully discussed and put forward many proposals. The Shijiazhuang City Representative Conference alone had as many as 130 proposals. The representative congresses in various places were filled with an atmosphere of unity. In addition to workers, farmers, students, staff, doctors, etc., there were also representatives of ethnic minorities among the representatives attending the congresses. At the congresses, representatives from various places were full of confidence in the future women's work. When the Chahar Provincial Women's Congress closed, the representatives unanimously expressed their determination to turn the resolutions of the congress into practical actions and organize the vast number of women into a great force on the production front and in supporting the front.
