　　Should Compensation Grain Be Given for a Leg Injury Sustained on Duty?
To the Editors:
    During the War of Resistance Against Japan, I worked at a transportation station in the rear. My leg was injured while running to report enemy activity. Later, the administrative office approved my discharge and issued me a third-class disability certificate. However, after returning home, I applied to the government for compensation several times, but they said that because the injury was not sustained in combat, disability grain would not be issued. I don't know how this matter should be handled. Please reply.

Comrade Han Tai:
    You worked at a transportation station, and your leg was injured while running to report enemy activity. This constitutes a disability sustained on duty. You can take your disability certificate to the county government to receive compensation grain (but you are not eligible to receive honorarium). It is incorrect for the county government not to issue it to you. However, before the new regulations are promulgated, the county government should still issue you compensation grain according to the old regulations. After the new regulations are promulgated, they will be implemented according to the new regulations.

专栏：询问与答复

　　因公摔坏腿是否该领抚恤粮？编者同志：
    过去在抗日战争时，我在后方交通站工作，因跑敌情将我腿跌伤，后经行署批准退伍，并给开三等残废证，但回家后向政府领了几次，曾说不是战斗负伤的，不发残废粮，这事情不知应怎样办？请答复一下。
    永年县三区韩庄韩太的韩太的同志：
    你在交通站工作，因跑敌情将腿跌伤，这是因公残废，可持你的残废证到县政府领抚恤粮（但不得领荣誉金），县政府不发给你是不对的，不过在新规定未颁发前，县政府还应按旧的规定发给你抚恤粮。待新的条例颁布后，再依新的条例执行。  　　　　华北人民政府民政部
