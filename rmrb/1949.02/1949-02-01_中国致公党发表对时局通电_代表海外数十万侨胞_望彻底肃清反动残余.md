Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 26th. The China Zhi Gong Party issued a circular on the 21st regarding the current situation, stating: To the Xinhua News Agency, the people of the whole country, and overseas Chinese: We respectfully read Chairman Mao of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China's statement on the current situation issued on the 14th of this month, exposing and denouncing the peace conspiracy of the reactionary government in Nanjing, and at the same time proposing eight conditions for democratic peace. The words are stern and the meaning is righteous, and it is truly the minimum requirement of the people of the whole country. Thinking about the root causes of the modern civil war in China, it was all caused by the dictatorial selfishness of Chiang Kai-shek, the leader of the Kuomintang reactionary government, who sold out the country and brought disaster to the people. After the end of the Anti-Japanese War, the Chinese people were given a chance to reform themselves and yearned for peace. However, Chiang's evil nature did not change, and he turned to American imperialism, overturned the Political Consultative Conference, and launched a civil war. His crimes are too numerous to count. Now, the Chiang Kai-shek war criminal clique is collapsing and disintegrating, and knowing that the general trend is gone, they falsely advocate peace in the hope of preserving their remaining evils and planning a comeback. This kind of foolish conspiracy will collapse without being attacked. However, in previous Chinese revolutions, the three major tasks of anti-imperialism, anti-feudalism, and anti-bureaucrat capitalism have not been thoroughly implemented, resulting in the country being reduced to a semi-colonial status. Now, fortunately, the people's revolution led by the Communist Party of China is nearing complete victory, and we earnestly hope to thoroughly eliminate the remaining reactionary forces, so that China can achieve true democratic peace. War criminals should be severely punished to appease the public's anger. Our party represents hundreds of thousands of overseas Chinese, looking forward to the peaceful unification, independence, prosperity, and strength of the motherland, and will certainly fight to the end for new democracy. We also hope that all sectors of compatriots in the Kuomintang-controlled areas will unanimously advocate for it.

　　中国致公党发表对时局通电
  　代表海外数十万侨胞
    望彻底肃清反动残余
    【新华社陕北二十六日电】中国致公党于二十一日发出对时局通电称：新华社转全国人民并海外侨胞公鉴：敬读中共中央毛主席本月十四日发表对时局声明，揭斥南京反动政府和平阴谋，同时提出民主和平八个条件。辞严义正，实为全国人民最低要求。窃念中国近代内战根源，胥由国民党反动政府首领蒋介石独裁自私，卖国祸民，有以致之。抗日战争结束，中国人民予以自新，曾渴望和平，奈蒋孽性不改，投靠美帝，推翻政协，发动内战，其罪恶擢发难数。现时蒋介石战犯集团，土崩瓦解，明知大势已去，假倡和平，冀保余孽，为卷土重来之计。此种愚妄阴谋，不攻自破。惟中国历次革命，对于反帝、反封建、反官僚资本三大任务，未能彻底执行，致国家乃沦于半殖民地地位。兹幸中共领导人民革命，已近全面胜利，甚望彻底肃清反动残余势力，使中国得到真正民主的和平。对于战争罪犯，并应严为惩处，以平人民公愤。本党代表海外数十万华侨，伫望祖国和平统一，独立富强，自当同为新民主主义而奋斗到底，并盼国民党统治区内各界同胞一致主张为幸。
