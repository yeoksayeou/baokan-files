　　Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 7th: TASS, Moscow: New Era magazine recently published an article expounding on the great significance of the establishment of the Council for Mutual Economic Assistance (COMECON), stating that the establishment of COMECON by Albania, Bulgaria, Hungary, Poland, Romania, the Soviet Union, and Czechoslovakia not only provides proof of the greatly developed economic cooperation between the people's democratic countries and between them and the Soviet Union, but also elevates this cooperation to a higher level. The purpose of COMECON is to more broadly develop economic cooperation among its member states. The committee will arrange mutual assistance in the joint utilization of economic experience, technical assistance, raw materials, food, machinery, and equipment, etc. At the same time, COMECON will be a powerful weapon against the imperialists' interference in the internal affairs of these independent and autonomous countries and all attempts to hinder the economic development of these countries. The Council for Mutual Economic Assistance, based on the true equality of its member states, is the embodiment of the Soviet Union's firm advocacy of the policy of genuine international democratic cooperation. The establishment of COMECON is an international economic and political event of the utmost importance. It proves the continuous growth and consolidation of the forces of democracy and socialism striving to ensure the peaceful development and happiness of all nations and to guarantee their economic progress and political independence.
