　　A Few Opinions on Revising the Marriage Law

    In your newspaper's January 28th article, "Opinions on Marriage Issues," the second question concerns the opinions of Comrades Yang and Tian: "Abnormal relationships between men and women are mainly due to poverty and a lack of freedom in marriage. ... Divorce should be granted to those who insist on it because they can no longer cohabitate." It also mentions: "The provision that 'those divorced or sentenced for adultery shall not marry their adulterous partner' contains feudal elements and restricts the freedom of marriage for some people. This provision should be revised immediately," and so on.

    I believe this interpretation is very reasonable, but it is not comprehensive enough. They only mentioned unreasonable marriages in the old society. Of course, this opinion can liberate some young men and women from the shackles of unreasonable marriages, but they did not mention how to deal with such situations when marriages are already voluntary and reasonable. Regarding the revision of the law, is it clearly stated that this provision should be fundamentally overturned, or should it have certain conditions and a "proviso" to indicate that free marital relationships are excluded? Some people interpret it as a complete overturning, which I believe is worth discussing.

    In the old society (especially in rural areas), old ethics and old laws did not allow certain men and women to have free and legal marriages, so they had to commit illegal adultery. This chaos was purely caused by the lack of freedom in marriage and social inequality. But now, we have broken through the semi-feudal and semi-colonial old society. Our legal provisions are based on the principles of equality between men and women, the one-couple system, and freedom and autonomy in marriage. Under the current social conditions, such abnormal relationships between men and women are a sign of being rash and irresponsible towards marriage. If a marriage is already free, and the couple has legitimate reasons, divorce can certainly be granted. After divorce, they should have complete freedom to remarry. However, having casual adultery with others without going through divorce procedures is illegal and should be subject to severe criticism and legal punishment. Besides, his/her partner can use this as a condition for divorce, but he/she has no right to demand a divorce. If a marriage libertarian and free lover who is unfaithful to love is allowed to occupy a field to do whatever he wants, this is not only unfair but also violates the ethics of a new democratic society.

### 关于修改婚姻法的一点意见

　　关于修改婚姻法的一点意见
    贵报一月二十八日“关于婚姻问题之意见”一文中第二个问题：杨田二同志的意见：“不正常的男女关系，主要是由于生活贫困和婚姻没有自由而形成的。……只要无法再同居而坚持离婚者，都可准其离婚”。又谈到：“‘因奸经判决离婚，或受刑之宣告者不得与相奸者结婚’的规定，含有维护封建的因素，限制了一些人的婚姻自由。这种规定应即修改”云云。
    我认为这种解释很有道理，但是不够全面。她们只提到旧社会的不合理的婚姻，这种意见当然可以解放了一部分青年男女的不合理婚姻的束缚，但是她们并未提到已经是自主自愿合理的婚姻，发生了此类情形时该如何处理。关于修改法律，也没明确指出应根本推翻该项规定，还是有一定条件的，加以“但书”，说明自由的婚姻关系除外呢？有些人解释为全部推翻，这样我认为尚有商榷的必要。
    旧社会（尤其在乡村中）的旧礼教、旧法律不允许某些男女自由的合法的婚姻，因而他们就只好非法相奸。这种混乱，纯粹是由于婚姻没有自由及社会的不平等所造成的，而现在已是突破了半封建半殖民地的旧社会，我们的法律规定是建筑在男女平等的一夫一妻制及婚姻自由自主原则基础上。在目前社会的条件下，这样男女不正常的关系是对结婚轻率不负责任的表现。已经是自由的婚姻，如果夫妻具有正当理由，当然可以准允离婚，在离婚后再结婚应有完全的自由。但不按离婚手续办事，而随便与别人相奸是违法的，应受严厉的批评与法律处分。除了他的对方可以以此作为离婚条件，而他本人是没有权利来要求离婚的。如果使一个对爱情不忠实的婚姻自由主义者与杯水主义者占取了为所欲为的领域，这不但是不公平的，而且也违反了新民主主义社会的道德。
