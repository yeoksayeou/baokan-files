　　Marriage Must Be Voluntary and Autonomous

    The People's Daily published an article by comrades Yang Yunyu and Tian Xiujuan on January 28th entitled "Opinions on Marriage Issues," and requested everyone to engage in discussion to seek better solutions. The newspaper has now received many opinions and is publishing them successively as follows:

    Having read the "Opinions on Marriage Issues" published in your newspaper, I would like to present my understanding for research: Indeed, as your newspaper stated, after the land reform in the vast rural areas of North China, the level of awareness among the broad masses has been unprecedentedly raised. The freedom of marriage and the establishment of happy and fulfilling families have become urgent needs for the broad masses of men and women. For thousands of years, China has been ruled by the feudal system, and countless men and women have groaned under the old marriage system. Some were forced into reluctant unions, regretting it for life; some had no choice but to elope or commit suicide. The chaos in male-female relationships in many places was also caused by the lack of freedom in marriage. How can there be happiness or joint efforts to get rich in such marriages? Now that the People's Liberation War is about to achieve complete victory, and a free, democratic, and prosperous new China is about to be built, I hope that our People's Government will lead a reform of the marriage system to ensure that everyone enjoys freedom of marriage, so as to perfectly implement the one-husband-one-wife system. Therefore, I agree that:

    (1) Marriage should be voluntary and autonomous for both men and women. No one should interfere or act on their behalf. If the relationship deteriorates and they cannot continue to live together, either party should be granted a divorce upon request. If the other party insists on not divorcing, then legal force should be used to implement it. Only in this way can everyone enjoy a happy and fulfilling marriage. Otherwise, a forced union will lead to bad consequences, even causing death. Many comrades in their work positions cannot concentrate on their work and cannot progress due to the burden of marriage problems. People with marriage problems also have low enthusiasm for production. These are enough to affect production and the revolutionary cause.

    (2) The main reason why one party in a marriage has an abnormal relationship with another person is that the marriage was not established on a basis of freedom, and the couple does not have a sincere relationship. If the couple has a harmonious relationship, even depending on each other for life, he or she will never abandon their loved one and have a relationship with someone else (individual hooligans may of course do so). Therefore, if one party (she or he) has an abnormal relationship with another person, a request for divorce should be approved. As for whom to marry after the divorce, they should be allowed to decide for themselves. If "divorce based on adultery" is used as a condition for not being able to marry the adulterer, this coercion violates the principle of freedom of marriage, contains feudal meaning, and is upholding the feudal system. But this is not to encourage adultery. If we want to eradicate this abnormal relationship between men and women, we can only thoroughly ensure that both men and women have freedom of marriage.

### 婚姻必须自愿自主

　　婚姻必须自愿自主
    一月二十八日本报发表了杨蕴玉，田秀娟两同志“关于婚姻问题的意见”一文，并要求大家展开讨论，以求得更好的解决，现本报已收到不少意见，特陆续发表如左：
    阅贵报所载“关于婚姻问题的意见”，谨把我的认识叙述如下，以供研究：确如贵报所载华北广大农村经过土地改革后，广大群众的觉悟程度空前提高，婚姻的自由及建立美满幸福的家庭已为广大男女群众迫切的需要。我国几千年来受封建制度统治，呻吟于旧式婚姻制度之下的男女不知多少，有的被迫勉强结合，抱恨终身，有的出于无奈，私奔自杀，许多地方男女关系的混乱，也是由于婚姻不自由所引起，象这样的婚姻，那里还谈得上什么幸福，合力发家致富呢？现在人民解放战争即将全面胜利，自由、民主、富强的新中国就要建设起来，希望我人民政府领导来一个婚姻制度改革，务使每一个人都得到婚姻自由，以完美地实行一夫一妻制。因此我同意：
    （一）结婚男女双方要自愿自主，任何人都不得干涉、代替，若因感情恶劣，不能继续同居，夫妻任何一方提出离婚时，都应该批准，若对方坚持不离，即由法律力量来实施。这样才能使每个人在婚姻上都享有美满幸福：否则勉强结合在一起，就会发生恶果的，甚至逼出人命。许多在工作岗位上的同志由于背着婚姻问题的包袱，不能安心工作，不能进步。群众有婚姻问题的，也是生产情绪不高。这些都足以影响生产影响革命事业。
    （二）关于夫妻的一方，有不正常的男女关系发生，主要还是婚姻没建立在自由基础上，夫妻双方也没有挚诚的感情。若夫妻俩感情融洽，甚至相依为命，他或她决不会放弃自己爱人而同其他人发生关系的（个别的流氓当然也有可能这样）。因此夫妻的一方（她或他）若有不正常的男女关系，请求离婚都该批准。至于离婚后再与谁结婚，都应听其自主的。若以“因奸判决离婚”作为不能和相奸者结婚的条件，这个强制是违反了婚姻自由原则的，是含有封建意义的，是维护封建制度的。但这并不是要助长通奸者的，要想根绝这种不正常的男女关系，那只有澈头澈尾的使男女双方都得到婚姻自由。
