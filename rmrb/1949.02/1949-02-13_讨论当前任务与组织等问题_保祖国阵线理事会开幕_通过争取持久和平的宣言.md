Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, February 11th: TASS, Sofia dispatch: The National Council of the Bulgarian Fatherland Front opened here on February 5th. One hundred and fifty-five prominent leaders from political, economic, and cultural circles, as well as outstanding industrial workers, attended the meeting. The agenda included listening to and discussing the report by Council Secretary-General Chervenkov on the political and organizational situation of the Fatherland Front and its current tasks, reviewing the election plan for the Fatherland Front's institutions, approving the National Council's 1949 budget, and resolving several organizational issues. In his report, Chervenkov detailed the Fatherland Front's activities since its reorganization last February, stating that in 1948, all organizations of the Fatherland Front increased their experience and strength. They mobilized the working people to strive for the completion of the two-year plan for the development of the national economy. In this regard, they did many things and initiated several valuable cultural and economic measures throughout the country. In view of the importance of Chervenkov's work in the Central Committee of the Communist Party (note: Chervenkov is one of the secretaries of the Central Committee of the Communist Party), the National Council of the Fatherland Front relieved him of his post as Secretary-General of the Council and unanimously elected Poptomov to succeed him. Poptomov is a member of the Politburo of the Bulgarian Communist Party Central Committee and the editor-in-chief of the "Workers' Affairs" newspaper. The meeting also adopted a declaration on international issues and the Bulgarian people's struggle for lasting peace.
