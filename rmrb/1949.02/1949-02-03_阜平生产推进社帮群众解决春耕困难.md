To meet the needs of farmers, it also organizes workers to go to households to repair various farm tools; and withdraws 2,400 catties of millet to support the Chengguan and Zhaowangtai Village Cooperatives in purchasing farm tools, and has purchased 215 parts for farming tools for the needs of the masses.
