　　【Our Newspaper News】Ci County, Taihang, has gained preliminary experience in establishing village-level people's representative conferences during the conclusion of land reform. We are introducing it as follows:

　　(1) Combine the rectification of the branch with thorough democratic education inside and outside the Party, and establish the People's Congress according to democratic procedures. Because we lacked systematic democratic education for Party members and the masses in the past, and Party members and the masses lacked democratic living habits, they still have many misunderstandings about democracy. For example, during this election of the People's Congress, some people thought: "The People's Congress is for ending land reform. Once land reform is over, the People's Congress will disband." Others thought: "The People's Congress is a review committee, and the representatives are reviewers." Some cadre Party members believed: "The representatives are helpers for the cadres, and the branch is the backstage supporter of the representatives." Obviously, these incorrect understandings must be addressed with thorough democratic education inside and outside the Party to improve the understanding of Party members and the masses. Ci County's approach is to combine the rectification of the branch with preliminary improvement of the relationship between Party members and the masses. During the rectification of the branch, Party member cadres, through criticism and self-criticism of past undemocratic work styles, recognize the harm of past undemocracy. Combined with the leadership's provision of some necessary democratic education, to enlighten their consciousness of democracy. For example, after the Xipeng Xiang branch criticized and examined the reasons for the past disunity of the branch and the lack of support from the masses, due to a lack of democracy. At this time, the leadership educated them on the part of the branch teaching material, Lesson 3, "How the Branch Leads the People's Congress." After explanation and discussion, everyone said: "If we had done this before, the work would have been done a long time ago. We must be democratic in the future!"

　　In addition, during the rectification of the branch, thorough democratic education must also be carried out among the masses. Combining the materials from the criticism and self-criticism of Party member cadres during the rectification of the branch, explain that the past undemocracy in the village was due to a lack of guarantees from democratic institutions, and that our ordinary people did not know how to use their democratic rights. At this time, the establishment of the People's Congress in the future and the role and nature of the People's Congress were explained to the masses. After such publicity and education, the masses' understanding of the People's Congress was improved. They generally took the election of the People's Congress very seriously. For example, the masses in the Third District proposed, "If the People's Congress is not elected well, the work will not be done well."

　　After democratic education has been carried out inside and outside the Party, and Party members and the masses have had a period of ideological preparation, the People's Congress can be formally established. In the election of the People's Congress, Ci County generally adopted two methods: one is simple and not cautious, electing according to women's shoe-making teams, men's land-tilling teams, or general mass meetings, or even only using members of the farmers' association. Obviously, this election method does not comply with democratic procedures. The other method, represented by Zhangjialou, involved registering citizens, reviewing citizens, dividing electoral districts according to citizens, nominating candidates, and then conducting a formal election. Finally, the number of citizens participating in the election and the number of votes each representative received were announced. This method is generally very cautious. The masses believe that "being elected as a representative is not simple, and we will truly have democracy in the future." At the same time, it creates an atmosphere of honor for being a representative. Many representatives, after being elected, expressed their attitude: "So many people think highly of us, we must work hard to serve the masses in the future." During the conclusion of land reform, the representatives were generally active and responsible.

　　(2) The branch must use its own exemplary actions and correct propositions to realize the political leadership of the branch in the People's Congress. The branch must realize political leadership in the People's Congress, and this political leadership must be based on the support of the masses. Therefore, after the Party-mass relationship has been initially improved through the rectification of the branch, and the branch has gained the trust of the masses, it must still use its own exemplary actions and correct propositions in daily work to realize the branch's leadership over the People's Congress. For example, in the Xiquanzhuang representative meeting, when discussing the distribution of fruits, some representatives were selfish and wanted to distribute more fruits. They proposed that Party member representative Shi Wanhua also distribute more fruits. Shi Wanhua resolutely refused and said: "I have been emancipated, and I will resolutely not distribute the fruits of the masses again." This influenced other representatives, who also did not distribute more. In the classification of classes in Xin'yijie, it was found that both Party member representatives and non-Party member representatives had emotional considerations, and the classification of several households was not accurate. At this time, the Party convened a branch meeting, carried out criticism and self-criticism, and examined this emotional consideration. After the Party members examined themselves, the branch decided to reclassify the classes, and the Party member representatives took the initiative to make self-criticism at the People's Congress and brought the branch's examination opinions to the People's Congress. This influenced other representatives, who also examined this emotional consideration. Finally, everyone unanimously supported the branch's opinions and reclassified several households. In addition to using its own exemplary actions and correct propositions to lead the People's Congress, the branch must also give full play to the collective leadership of the entire branch and strengthen the connection between the Party and the representatives in terms of methods. In Xiliukai Village, District 9, six of the twelve Party members were elected as representatives. These six Party members discussed the work together before and after each representative meeting. Although they paid attention to the branch's leadership over the People's Congress, the other six Party members who were not elected as representatives had nothing to do. Xin'jie did a better job in this regard. They stipulated that after the branch discussed and made a resolution, Party members and representative Party members would meet once a day. Party members would hand over the opinions they heard from the masses and their own opinions to the representative Party members to take to the People's Congress. In this way, the leadership of all Party members was brought into play. In addition, they also strengthened the connection between Party members and non-Party representatives. Before each People's Congress meeting, Party members would talk to the representatives individually, solicit their opinions, and mobilize them to speak at the representative meeting. In this way, each issue was prepared in advance, and the representatives also actively spoke. Therefore, during the discussion, each issue could generally be resolved quickly and smoothly.

　　(3) The representative conference must develop democratic habits. Before and after making a resolution, it must always connect with the masses, absorb the opinions of the broad masses, and implement the resolutions of the representative conference. The People's Congress is the highest authority in the whole village. Every resolution it makes is related to the interests of the masses in the whole village. Therefore, the representative conference itself must fully develop democracy, cultivate its democratic habits, and always pay attention to connecting with the masses. Some village representatives mistakenly believe that "the representative is the highest authority, and whatever the representative decides is final. Who would dare not implement it?" In this way, the representative conference will generate new undemocratic practices. Quanshui did a better job in this regard. They elected a recorder for each representative meeting. When deciding on each issue, they conscientiously implemented the principle of the minority obeying the majority. After the decision was made, the recorder recorded it in the book and read it to everyone for approval. In this way, many representatives reflected: "The representative conference is truly implementing democracy." They are also more cautious and responsible in discussing and deciding on issues. In addition, in terms of how the representative conference connects with the masses, the method of Shicunying is: before discussing and making decisions, each representative goes deep into the masses to understand the thoughts of the masses, and then makes resolutions based on the thoughts of the masses. For example, a widowed old woman: she has no house, but she resolutely does not want a house. After the representatives went deep to understand her thoughts, they found that she did not not want a house, but still had concerns in her mind. The representative conference decided to leave her a house. When the list of fruit distribution for the whole village was announced, she was not announced. The old woman saw that everyone else had a house, but she did not, so she cried and said: "I regret it, I did something without materials." At this time, the representative announced that the house was still reserved for her. She immediately became very happy and stopped crying. In addition, after making a resolution, the representatives still have to go deep to understand the thoughts of the masses, conduct persuasion and education, and implement the resolutions of the representative conference. Duan Wanghua in this village had distributed many houses in the past (18 rooms for three people). This time, the representative conference decided to draw a few houses from her. She was very dissatisfied. The representatives patiently persuaded and explained to her, and appropriately took care of her interests. She wanted to give it to an old woman to live in. The People's Congress listened to her opinions. In this way, she was also very satisfied with the houses that were taken from her in the end.

　　支部积极参加领导
  　充分开展民主教育
    磁县建立人代会取得初步经验
    【本报讯】太行磁县在结束土改中建立村级人民代表会，获得初步经验，特介绍如下：
    （一）结合整顿支部在党内外进行充分的民主教育，按民主手续成立人代会。由于我们过去对党员与群众缺乏系统的民主教育，党员与群众缺乏民主生活习惯，因之他们对民主尚存在着许多误解：如在这次选举人代会中，有人认为：“人代会是结束土改的，结束土改完了，人代会就散了。”还有人认为：“人代会是评议员，代表是评议员”。有的干部党员认为：“代表是干部的帮手，支部是代表的后台”。显然这些错误的认识在党内外必须进行充分的民主教育，来提高党员与群众的认识。磁县的做法是在选举人代会前，结合整顿支部初步改善党员与群众的关系，在整顿支部中，党员干部从批判检讨过去的不民主作风，认识过去不民主的危害，结合领导上对他们进行一些必要的民主教育，来启发他们对民主的自觉。如西彭厢支部在批判检讨了过去支部不团结，群众不拥护等原因，是由于不民主。这时领导上便把支部教材第三课中“支部如何领导人代会”的部分，进行了教育，经过讲解讨论后，大家说：“咱以前要象这样，工作早闹好了，以后可得民主哩！”
    另外，在整顿支部过程中，同时在群众中也要进行充分的民主教育，结合整顿支部中党员干部检讨的材料，说明村中过去不民主是由于缺乏民主制度的保证，咱们老百姓不知道怎么使用咱们的民主权利。这时便把今后如何成立人代会、人代会的作用性质等向群众作教育，经过这样宣传教育后，提高了群众对人代会认识。他们对选举人代会，一般很慎重，如三区群众提出“人代会选不好，工作作不好”。
    在党内外进行了民主教育，党员群众都有一段思想酝酿后，便可正式成立人代会。在选举人代会的做法上，磁县一般是采取了两种作法：一种是简单的不慎重的，按妇女做鞋队，男人代耕队或笼统的群众会，甚至光农会会员来进行选举。显然这种选法，是不合民主手续的。另一种是以张家楼为代表，他们经过登记公民，审查公民，按公民划分选区，提出候选人，然后进行正式选举，最后宣布参加选举公民人数，各代表当选票数。这种办法一般很慎重，群众认为“当选代表真不简单，今后真正要民主哩”，同时也造成当代表的光荣空气。许多代表当选后，表示态度“这么多人看起咱，以后可要好好给群众办事哩”，在结束土改中，代表一般都积极负责。
    （二）支部必须以自己的模范行动、正确主张，在人代会中实现支部的政治领导。支部在人代会中要实现政治领导，而这个政治领导，，又必须建立在群众拥护的基础上。因此经过整顿支部初步改善了党群关系，支部取得群众信任后，在日常具体工作中，还必须以自己的模范行动、正确主张，来实现支部对人代会的领导。如西泉庄在代表会中，讨论分配果实时，有些代表自私自利，，想多分果实，便提出让党员代表史万华也多分果实，史万华便坚决拒绝说：“我翻透身了，我坚决不再分群众果实。”这便影响其他代表，也不多分了。新义街在划阶级中，发现党员代表与非党员代表都有情面思想，几户阶级划的不准确。这时，党便召开支部会，开展批评与自我批评，检讨这种情面思想，党员检讨后，支部便决议重划阶级，并由党员代表到人代会中，主动作自我检讨，并把支部检讨意见提到人代会，这时影响其他代表，也检讨了这种情面思想，最后大家一致拥护支部的意见，又重划了几户阶级。另外支部除用自己模范行动和正确主张来领导人代会外，在方法上还必须发挥全体支部的集体领导，和加强党与代表的连系。九区西六开全村十二个党员，有六个党员当选代表，这六个党员每次开代表会前后，便在一块讨论工作，他们虽然注意了支部对人代会的领导，但其他六个没有被选为代表的党员，就没有事了。新街在这方面做的比较好，他们规定支部讨论决议以后，党员与代表党员，每天接头一次，党员把自己听到群众反映，及自己意见交给代表党员，代到人代会去，这样便发挥了全体党员的领导作用。另外他们还加强了党员与非党代表的联系，每次开人代会前，党员即与代表个别谈话，征求他们意见，发动他们在代表会上发言，这样每个问题在事前都有酝酿准备，代表也积极发言，因此在讨论中，每个问题一般都能很快很顺利的解决。
    （三）代表会要养成民主习惯，在做出决议前后，必须时刻连系群众，吸收广大群众意见，贯彻代表会的决议。人代会是全村最高权力机关，它的每一个决议，都关系全村群众的利益，因此代表会本身必须充分发挥民主，养成他们的民主习惯，并时刻注意连系群众。有些村代表误认为“代表是最高权力哩，有啥问题代表一决定就算了，谁还敢不执行”，这样代表会便又会产生新的不民主作风。泉头在这方面做的比较好，他们每次开代表会，都选出纪录人，在决定每个问题时，认真执行少数服从多数的原则，决定以后，由记录记到本上，并向大家念一遍，让大家通过，这样许多代表便反映说：“代表会真正是实行民主哩”。他们对讨论和决定个问题，也比较慎重和负责。另外在代表会如何连系群众问题上，时村营的办法是：他们在讨论决定之前，各个代表都深入群众了解群众思想，然后根据群众思想作出决议，如一个寡妇老人：她没房子，但他坚决不要房子，经代表深入了解思想后，发现她并不是不要，是思想上仍有顾虑。代表会便决定给他留下一座房子，等到宣布全村分配果实名单时，没有宣布她，这个老婆看到其他人都有了房子，只她没有就哭了说：“我后悔了，我办了没材料事了”，这时代表便宣布还给她留着房子，她马下很高兴不哭了。另外在做出决议之后，代表仍然要深入了解群众思想，进行说服教育，贯彻代表会的决议。该村段王花，她过去多分很多房子（三口人十八间），这次代表会决议抽她几间房子，她很不满意，代表便耐心向她说服解释，并适当照顾她的利益，她要分给一个老婆住，人代会听取了她的意见，这样最后抽她的房子，她也很满意了。
