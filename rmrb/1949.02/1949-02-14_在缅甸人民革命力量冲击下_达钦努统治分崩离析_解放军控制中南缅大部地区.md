Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 12th. The rapid development of the Burmese people's revolutionary movement has caused the Thakin Nu reactionary government's rule to disintegrate.

After Thakin Nu's shameless trick of publishing a so-called "left-wing unity plan" and a "Marxist" program for building a "free and socialist Burma" to divide the democratic forces failed in May and June of last year, a large number of government soldiers defected to the people's armed forces. The Burmese People's Liberation Army now controls most of the densely populated central and southern Burma regions between Rangoon and Mandalay. According to a France-Presse dispatch from London on the 7th of this month, "Large areas within Burma are already in the hands of the Communists."

Under the impact of the powerful people's revolutionary forces, the internal strife within the Rangoon ruling clique has intensified. In July of last year, changes occurred in the Volunteer Army, one of the main pillars of the ruling "Freedom League." By September, the Karen, one of Burma's largest ethnic minorities, had also launched a "rebellion."

The Karen "rebellion" has recently intensified. An Associated Press dispatch from Rangoon on January 31st quoted a Burmese government spokesman as saying that new fierce battles had taken place between the Karen and the Burmese Federal Army. Reports from American and British news agencies pointed out that the "rebels" had cut off traffic between Rangoon and its main food supply areas to the north, and were attacking and occupying Rangoon railway station and other strongholds around Rangoon. The Karen army attacked Insein, 10 miles north of Rangoon, occupied Taungming between Insein and Rangoon, and then controlled the important railway city of Toungoo. As of the 7th, fighting was continuing in Insein, Bassein (a city in the Irrawaddy Delta), and Pegu, in the suburbs and north of Rangoon.

The Karen "rebellion" was instigated behind the scenes by British imperialists. According to a report in the British Communist Workers' Daily, Britain is attempting to use armed ethnic autonomy movements to form a more docile puppet government to replace the Thakin Nu reactionary clique, which has become too weak to deal with the powerful people's revolutionary movement. However, due to the expansion of events, it has gradually shown the desire of the broad masses of the Karen people to struggle for genuine autonomy. According to a France-Presse dispatch, this has alarmed the reactionaries in London.

　　在缅甸人民革命力量冲击下
    达钦努统治分崩离析
    解放军控制中南缅大部地区
    【新华社陕北十二日电】缅甸人民革命运动的急速发展，使达钦努反动政府的统治分崩离析。
    自去年五六月间达钦努发表了哄骗人民的所谓“左翼团结方案”及建设“自由与社会主义缅甸的‘马克思主义’纲领”，企图借以分化民主力量的无耻伎俩破产之后，缅甸即发生了大批政府士兵向人民武装投诚的事件。缅甸人民解放军现在已控制了仰光与曼德勒间人口繁密的中、南缅绝大部分地区。据法新社本月七日伦敦电称：“缅甸境内大片地区已在共产党手中。”
    在强大的人民革命力量的冲击下，仰光统治集团的内闳日益加剧，去年七月，当权的“自由同盟”的主要支柱之一的志愿军发生更变。至九月间，缅甸最大少数民族之一的克伦族又继起“叛乱”。
    克伦族的“叛乱”最近已经加剧。美联社一月卅一日仰光电引缅甸政府发言人称：克伦人与缅甸联邦军队之间已发生新的激战。美英通讯社的报导指出：“叛军”已切断了仰光及其以北食粮主要供给地之间的交通，并在仰光外围到处进攻并占领仰光火车站及其他据点。克伦族军队曾袭击仰光以北十哩的因辛，占据了因辛与仰光之间的当明，其后又控制了重要铁路城市倘古。截至七日止，战事仍在因辛、巴森（伊洛瓦底江三角州城市）和仰光近郊及其以北的庇古诸地继续中。
    克伦族的“叛乱”是由英帝国主义者幕后策动起来的。据英共工人日报报导：英国企图以武装的民族自治运动来达到组成更驯顺的傀儡政府，以代替业已显得过分软弱，不足以对付强大人民革命运动的达钦努反动集团。但是，由于事变的扩大，已逐渐表现出克伦族广大群众要求真正自治的斗争的意愿。据法新社日电，这已引起伦敦反动派惊慌。
