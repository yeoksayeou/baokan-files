Xinhua News Agency, East China, 7th: Nantong City, a nationally renowned cotton-producing area and the textile industry center of northern Jiangsu, was liberated on the 1st of this month. The enemy garrison in the city, including the 146th Division, the 308th Division, and local Kuomintang reactionary armed forces, fled south across the Yangtze River. Four squadrons of the Nantong Security Brigade of the Kuomintang stationed in Tangzha and Bachang northwest of the city refused the order to flee south and, led by the brigade's deputy Qiu Jusheng, defected with their weapons. Prior to this, the People's Liberation Army successively recovered the three riverside cities of Qidong, Haimen to the east of Nantong, and Jingjiang to the west on the 27th and 28th of last month. Currently, all areas north of the Yangtze River in Jiangsu Province, except for the two county towns of Yizheng and Jiangpu and a few enemy bridgehead strongholds along the river, have been liberated. Nantong, famous throughout the country for its cotton production, is a well-known industrial area and economic and cultural center in northern Jiangsu. It is located on the north bank of the lower reaches of the Yangtze River, about 100 li across the river from Shanghai. The population of the urban area alone reaches 130,000. It is the starting point of the Tongyu Highway that runs through northern Jiangsu. The area is rich in cotton, rice, and fish, and has cotton yarn, textile, match, power generation, tin, iron and other factories, especially the cotton textile native cloth industry is the most developed. Before the Anti-Japanese War, cloth was sold as far as the three northeastern provinces, but in recent years, under the rule of the Kuomintang reactionary traitorous government, all industries have been greatly devastated.

Xinhua News Agency, East China, 7th: Since the recovery of coastal cities along the Yangtze River such as Nantong, Haimen, Qidong, Jingjiang, and Taixing, northern Jiangsu, except for a few remaining enemy strongholds along the river, has been completely liberated. The northern Jiangsu liberated area was the first area to be subjected to a full-scale offensive by the Kuomintang reactionaries during the Liberation War. In July 1946, the Kuomintang reactionary traitorous government concentrated 500,000 troops to launch a frenzied offensive. At the height of the bandit army's arrogance, all 24 county towns in northern Jiangsu were occupied by the enemy. Since the launch of the great Huaihai Campaign last November, the army and people of northern Jiangsu have coordinated with the offensive of the field army, launching attacks one after another. Since then, the difficult situation of long-term adherence to the enemy's rear in northern Jiangsu has completely ended, and the situation has turned to the offensive. From December 3rd to 13th of last year, the local troops of the Northern Jiangsu People's Liberation Army successively recovered the former Suwanbian District capital Huaiyin and the four county towns of Huai'an, Baoying, and Xinghua. At the same time, they captured Jiangyan, a major town on the Hai (an) Tai (zhou) line, annihilated ten squadrons of the Kuomintang Security Regiment, and forced the enemy to retreat to Gaoyou, Taizhou, Hai'an, and other places and the area south along the Yangtze River. At the end of December, the People's Liberation Army launched an attack on the enemy surrounding Huangqiao, east of Taixing City. On New Year's Day, they completely annihilated five battalions of the 230th Division of the enemy that came to aid from Taizhou between Taixing and Huangqiao, captured its Deputy Division Commander Su Guijing alive, and recovered seven strongholds such as Huangqiao. On January 10th, the Huaihai Campaign ended victoriously. The Northern Jiangsu People's Liberation Army took advantage of the victory to advance towards the enemy. From the 18th to the 25th, they successively liberated famous cities such as Gaoyou, Taizhou, Taixing, Rugao, and Yangzhou, as well as important towns such as Hai'an, Qintong, and Gushan. Among them, the garrison bandits in Gushan and Yangmoqiao (both north of Jingjiang City) were forced to surrender. Under the shock of the People's Liberation Army's prestige, the enemy garrisons in Qidong, Haimen, Jingjiang and other county towns and their surrounding strongholds fled in panic on the 27th and 28th. The division headquarters of the 146th Division of the 21st Army, which guarded Jinsha Town northeast of Nantong, led a regiment and fled to Nantong, where more than 130 of them were annihilated by our pursuit. The enemy garrisons at Jiangzao Port and Chuan Port northwest of Haimen were forced to surrender completely. On the 31st, the People's Liberation Army broke through the enemy defending Langshan, south of Nantong City. The next day (February 1st), the enemy's 146th Division, 308th Division and other bandit troops in Nantong fled south across the Yangtze River in a panic.

Xinhua News Agency, East China, 7th: The Nantong Municipal Military Control Commission was established on the 3rd upon order. He Ximing is the chairman, and Zhou Yifeng and Xie Kedong are the vice-chairmen. The Municipal People's Government and the Garrison Command have also been established. Ye Chao and Zou Qiang are the mayor and deputy mayor, respectively, and Wang Zhiping and Peng Shousheng are the commander and deputy commander of the garrison, respectively. All have taken office and are performing their duties.

　　上海对岸一百里处
  　我军解放南通
  　苏北几近完全解放
    【新华社华东七日电】全国著名的棉产地和江苏北部纺织业中心的南通城，已于本月一日解放。城内守敌一四六师、三零八师及国民党地方反动武装等，渡江南逃。驻扎该城西北唐闸、八厂的国民党南通保安大队四个中队，拒绝南逃命令，在大队副邱菊生率领下，携械投诚。在此之前，解放军于上月二十七、二十八两日，先后收复南通以东的启东、海门及以西的靖江等三个沿江城市。现江苏省的长江以北的地区，除仪征、江浦两座县城及少数沿江敌之桥头据点外，已全部解放。以产棉驰名全国的南通，是苏北著名的实业区及经济、文化中心之一，位于长江下游北岸，与上海隔江相距约一百里，人口仅城区即达十三万，为纵贯苏北的通榆公路的起点。本地盛产棉、米、鱼，有棉纱、纺织、火柴，发电、锡、铁等工厂，尤以棉纺土布业最为发达，抗日战争以前布匹远销东北三省，但近年在国民党反动卖国政府统治下各业都受到很大摧残。
    【新华社华东七日电】自南通、海门、启东、靖江、泰兴等长江沿岸城市收复后，江苏北部除江边尚有敌人少数残余据点外，已全告解放。苏北解放区在解放战争中，是首先遭到国民党反动派全面进攻的地区，一九四六年七月，国民党反动卖国政府曾集中五十万军队发动疯狂的进攻。在匪军气势最猖獗时，苏北全境二十四座县城全部被敌侵占。自去年十一月伟大的淮海战役发动后，苏北军民配合野战军的进攻，纷纷出击，从此苏北长期坚持敌后斗争的困难局面即完全结束，转入了进攻。自去年十二月三日至十三日，苏北解放军地方部队先后收复原苏皖边区首府淮阴及淮安、宝应、兴化等四座县城，同时攻克海（安）泰（州）线重镇姜堰，歼灭国民党保安团十个中队，迫使敌退踞高邮、泰州、海安等地及以南沿江地带。十二月底解放军向泰兴城东下黄桥周围守敌发动攻击，元旦日在泰兴、黄桥间全歼自泰州出援之敌二三零师五个营，活捉其副师长苏桂菁，收复黄桥等七个据点。一月十日淮海战役胜利结束，苏北解放军乘胜向敌进击，自十八日至二十五日，又先后解放高邮、泰州、泰兴、如皋、扬州等名城及海安、溱潼、孤山等重镇，其中孤山、杨末桥两地（均在靖江城北）守匪三百余被迫缴械投降。在解放军声威震慑下，启东、海门、靖江等县城及各外围据点守敌，于二十七、二十八两日，纷纷慌忙撤逃。南通东北金沙镇守匪二十一军一四六师师部率一个团向南通逃窜途中，被我追歼一百三十余名。海门西北的姜灶港、川港守敌，被迫全部投降。三十一日解放军破击南通城南狼山守匪，次日（二月一日），南通之敌一四六师、三零八师等匪部，即狼狈渡江南逃。
    【新华社华东七日电】南通市军事管制委员会于三日奉命成立。主任委员为贺希明、副主任委员为周一峰、谢克东。该市人民市政府及警备司令部亦已成立。叶朝、邹强为正副市长，王治平、彭寿生为正副警备司令，均已到职视事。
