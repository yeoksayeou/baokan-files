　　Xinhua News Agency, Central Plains, 5th: In the newly liberated areas of western Henan, such as Lushan, Shifeng, Jiaxian, Linru, Yuxian, and other places, peasants have launched democratic struggles against local bullies and bandits, seeking to overthrow the reactionary feudal ruling forces in order to achieve genuine political liberation and preliminary improvements in their lives. These struggles have already achieved considerable victories. Now, this democratic struggle has developed from struggles in several scattered districts and villages to struggles in broader areas.

　　In the Central Plains region, especially in Henan, the trinity of evil forces - local bullies, bandits, and Kuomintang secret agents - has weighed heavily on the peasants for many years like a large stone. If this stone is not removed, there can be no talk of peasant movements or social reforms. Therefore, after the regular Kuomintang bandit troops were eliminated, the democratic struggle against local bullies and bandits became the primary step and central link in initiating the mobilization of the peasant masses to implement systematic social reforms.

　　This movement began in September of last year, with various localities first selecting certain locations for experimentation. After the work of collecting autumn public grain was carried out, the democratic struggle unfolded on a larger scale in the aforementioned counties. In areas where this struggle was correctly launched, the level of awareness and organization of the peasants was significantly improved. In the first district of Shifeng County, peasants carried out 62 struggles against local bullies and bandits in two months. During these struggles, 85 village peasant associations and 9 township peasant associations were established, with 3,972 members (including 835 women). More than 20 villages organized militia. According to statistics from Linru County as of December 7th last year, 107 village peasant associations and 7 township peasant associations had been established throughout the county, and peasants had launched 97 struggles against local bullies.

　　The reasons why this struggle was able to unfold relatively quickly, in addition to the slogans against bandits and local bullies meeting the demands of the vast oppressed people in the newly liberated areas and the strong leadership of the Communist Party and the democratic government, were also due to the following favorable conditions: (1) The People's Liberation Army achieved great victories in the autumn offensive, and Zhengzhou, Kaifeng, Nanyang and other places were successively liberated. Bandit and bully elements lost their reliance in military, political and all other aspects. At the same time, the masses' fears of "the sky changing" (fearing that the Kuomintang army would come back to occupy) and "sawing back and forth" (fearing that the enemy and us would fight back and forth, and the situation would be uncertain) were greatly reduced. (2) The victory of the bandit suppression struggle in western Henan. In one year and four months, more than 41,000 bandits were annihilated and disintegrated. (3) A large number of cadres came from North China and Shandong, strengthening the leadership. (4) The agricultural slack season was utilized, allowing peasants time to deliberate, hold meetings, and facilitating the development of the movement.

　　Generally, mobilizing peasants to carry out democratic struggles begins by first selecting certain villages as key points. The villages selected as key points are mostly of moderate size and appropriately located, because if they are too large, the work is not easy to open up; if they are too small, it is not easy to expand influence. After the peasant association workers enter the key villages, they first find peasants for individual talks, family visits, or hold mass meetings and various forms of forums to explain their intentions to the peasant masses, publicize the victorious situation of the war, and publicize the Communist Party's various policies to help peasants turn over, in order to break the peasants' ideological concerns such as "fearing that the People's Liberation Army will not be able to stand firm" and "fearing retaliation and sniping from bandits and bullies". Even so, due to the long-term influence of Kuomintang deceptive propaganda on the peasants in the newly liberated areas, and the great threat of the feudal rule of local bullies and evil gentry pressing on the peasants, coupled with the fact that the vast majority of peasant association workers are from other places, the general honest and hard-working peasants often dare not approach the peasant association workers. At this time, peasant association personnel with experience in the peasant movement often approach the masses by helping peasants with labor and production, coordinating war service in the villages, and publicizing various social policies (such as reasonable burden, etc.), to understand the class relations in the villages and the living conditions of the peasants, and discover and cultivate activists among the peasant masses. Because these are the issues that the masses are most concerned about and most urgently want to solve. Approaching the masses and gaining their understanding is a necessary step in carrying out work, and it is a task that requires very careful and patient work. It often takes a lot of time and effort. But as long as you can put down your airs, go deep into the masses, trust the masses, and follow the mass line, you will definitely succeed. After doing this step of work, many places have entered the stage of organizing the masses, discussing the targets and content of the struggle, and brewing the struggle. At this time, whether the composition of the selected activists is pure is very important. In some villages, the activists found are truly hard-working peasants, and their enthusiasm for struggle is very high. Later, they united the vast number of peasants and launched a genuine mass struggle. In some villages, because the activists were not found well, the running dogs of local bullies and evil gentry were mistaken for activists, and the struggle was sabotaged. After finding good activists, the peasant association workers seized the opportunity to enlighten and educate them. When the activists have a preliminary understanding that they must organize in order to turn over, they develop peasant organizations through them. In the beginning, it is generally carried out separately and secretly. When it develops to a certain extent, relationships are opened up, and everyone gathers together for a meeting. When everyone sees that there are many people and great strength, their confidence rises. At this time, the peasant association is officially announced. Poor and hired peasants become the backbone of the peasant association, and the regime is initially transformed on the basis of the peasant association. In general villages, while carrying out these tasks, the peasant association workers mobilize the peasants to carry out small-scale reasoning struggles against the local tyrants and evil gentry, with the aim of training the masses. The content of this reasoning struggle meeting: In areas where land reform has already been carried out, the focus is on opposing the landlord's reversal; in areas where land reform has not been carried out, the focus is on opposing unfair burdens and corruption. This struggle mainly aims to politically attack the most reactionary bully elements. In order to better organize the masses and make the struggle more mature, three types of education were conducted for peasants in places where the work was good: (1) Conducting class education through small-scale grievance telling. (2) Guiding the strategy education of how to fight. (3) Democratic education against coercion and commandism.

　　In many places, after the peasants have been initially trained through the experiment in key villages, they quickly expand the influence and scope of the struggle, so that the breakthrough from points turns into the expansion of faces. The step is to pre-set attached point villages around the key villages, equip a small number of cadres with the key village activists, and implement village-to-village communication to tell grievances. And absorb the masses of the attached point villages to participate in the anti-bully struggle in the key villages to promote the ideological brewing of the nearby masses. After the struggle in the key villages unfolds, the movement is quickly promoted. However, a bias has occurred in some places, that is, many peasant association personnel are crowded into one key working village, and a certain number of personnel are not dispersed to nearby villages, and after the struggle in the key village is launched, they do not go to nearby villages to promote and absorb the peasants there to participate, so that the scale of the movement cannot be expanded, and the struggle in the key village is isolated, the peasants become timid, and the landlords take the opportunity to counterattack, causing the movement to suffer setbacks. This bias has mostly been corrected later. Many places have adopted the method of convening township, district, and county peasant representative conferences and activist training classes when expanding the scope of the struggle. Through this form, the movement has rapidly expanded to the scope of the whole township, whole district, and whole county. Recently, Linru, Jia (county) west and other counties have done this, and have received good results. At such representative conferences, peasants are mobilized to tell their grievances in order to enlighten their class consciousness and stimulate their fighting spirit against bandits and bullies. Among the grievances told in various places, women often play a leading role. This is because after the Kuomintang arrested their husbands and sons, their lives lost their reliance, and the atrocities of bullies and bandits occupying and raping made the suffering of women particularly deep.

　　Currently, the democratic struggle against bandits and bullies by peasants in Linru, Jiaxian, Shifeng, Lushan and other places has developed into a district-wide and county-wide movement. On the basis of this movement, rural branches of the Communist Party have begun to be established, and have gradually become the core of rural work. This movement in the above-mentioned areas has had a considerable impact on neighboring counties. In the future, as long as there is correct leadership, full use is made of the current influence of military victory and the leisure season, and its own existing experience is summarized, it is very likely to create a climax of the democratic struggle against bandits and bullies in the entire western Henan region, organize the broad masses, closely link the Communist Party with the masses, and lay the mass foundation for supporting the liberation war, developing production, further implementing social reforms, and eliminating feudal forces in the future.

　　豫西新解放区
  　发动农民的初步成绩与经验
    【新华社中原五日电】河南西部新解放区鲁山、实丰、郏县、临汝、禹县等地农民展开反恶霸反土匪的民主斗争，谋求推翻反动的封建统治势力，以取得政治上的真正解放和生活上的初步改善，已经得到了不少胜利。现在这一民主斗争已由若干分散的区和村的斗争向着广大地区的斗争发展。
    在中原地区，特别是河南地区，多年来恶霸、土匪、国民党特务这个三位一体的恶势力，象一块大石头般沉重地压在农民的身上。这块石头不揭掉，什么农民运动，社会改革，都无从谈起。因此，在正规的国民党匪军被肃清之后，反恶霸、反土匪的民主斗争，便成为进入发动农民群众实行系统的社会改革的首要步骤与中心环节。
    这个运动开始于去年九月，先是各地选择一定地点进行试验。在进行了征收秋季公粮工作以后，民主斗争就在上述数县较大规模地展开起来。凡是正确地发动了这种斗争的地区，农民的觉悟程度与组织程度，就都有显著的提高。实丰县第一区的农民在两个月中对恶霸、土匪进行了六十二次斗争，在斗争中已经建立了八十五个村农会、九个乡农会，会员达三千九百七十二人（内有妇女八百三十五人），有二十余村组织了民兵武装。临汝县截至去年十二月七日止的统计，全县已成立了一百零七个村农会、七个乡农会，农民起来对恶霸斗争了九十七次。
    这一斗争之所以能够比较迅速地展开，除了反土匪反恶霸这一斗争口号符合新解放地区广大被压迫人民的要求及共产党和民主政府有力领导外，还由于有这样的几个有利条件：（一）解放军在秋季攻势以来取得了伟大胜利，郑州、开封、南阳等地相继解放，土匪恶霸分子在军事、政治各方面都失去了依靠。同时群众中怕“变天”（害怕国民党军再来占领）、怕“拉锯”（害怕敌我双方打过来，打过去，局面不定）的思想，则大大减少。（二）是豫西剿匪斗争的胜利。在一年又四个月中歼灭和瓦解了土匪四万一千多人。（三）由华北、山东来了一大批干部，加强了领导的力量。（四）是利用了农间季节，农民有时间酝酿、开会，也便利了运动的开展。
    发动农民进行民主斗争一般都是首先选择一定的村子作为重点进行。被选为重点的这个村庄大多地位适中，大小适当。因为过大则工作不易打开；太小又不易扩大影响。农会工作人员进入重点村后，都是先找农民进行个别谈话，家庭访问，或召开群众大会和各种形式的座谈会，向农民群众表明来意，宣传战争的胜利形势，宣传共产党帮助农民翻身的各种政策，用以打破农民的“怕人民解放军站不住”，“怕土匪恶霸报复、打黑枪”等思想顾虑。即使如此，由于新解放区农民长期受国民党欺骗宣传影响，而且压在农民头上的土劣恶霸的封建统治势力的威胁很大，加以农会工作人员绝大多数都是外地人，所以一般老实而劳苦的农民往往不敢和农会工作人员接近。这时，有农民运动经验的农会人员，常常用帮助农民劳动生产，调剂村子里的战争勤务，和宣传各种社会政策（如合理负担等）去接近群众，了解村子里的阶级关系和农民生活情况，发现与培养农民群众中的积极分子。因为这些都是群众所最关心，最迫切要求解决的问题。接近群众，取得群众的了解，这是开展工作的必经步骤，是一个需要非常仔细、耐心地进行的工作。往往需要化费很多的时间和力量。但要只能放下架子，深入群众，相信群众，走群众路线，就一定能成功。在做了这一步工作后，许多地方都是进入组织群众，商定斗争对象和斗争内容，酝酿斗争。这时，所选择的积极分子成份是否纯洁，关系十分重大。有些村庄所找的积极分子真正是劳而又苦的农民，斗争积极性很高，以后便经过他们团结了广大农民，开展了真正的群众斗争。有些村庄因为找积极分子没有找好，把土劣恶霸的走狗误认为积极分子，斗争便遭到破坏。在找到了好的积极分子后，农会工作人员便抓紧对于他们的启发和教育。在积极分子有了要想翻身就必须组织起来的初步认识时，即通过他们去发展农民的组织。开始时，一般还是分别地秘密地去进行，当发展到了一定程度，便打通关系，集合在一起开会，大家看到人多力量大，信心就高涨起来。这时才正式宣布成立农会。贫雇农成为农会中的骨干，在农会基础上初步改造政权。一般村庄，农会工作人员在进行这些工作同时，就发动农民向土豪劣绅进行小规模的说理斗争，目的是在锻炼群众。这种说理斗争的会议内容：在已经进行土地改革的地区以反对地主的倒算为主；在不曾进行土地改革的地区，则以反负担不公、反贪污为主。这种斗争，主要是从政治上打击最反动的恶霸分子。为使群众组织得更好，斗争酝酿得更成熟，在工作好的地方，都对农民进行了三种教育：（一）通过小型诉苦，进行阶级教育。（二）指导如何斗争的策略教育。（三）反对强迫命令的民主教育。
    许多地方在经过重点村的试验，农民得到初步锻炼后，即迅速扩大斗争影响与斗争范围，使由点的突破转变为面的扩张。其步骤是在重点村周围预设附点村，配备少数干部结合重点村积极分子，实行村村串通诉苦。并吸收附点村群众参加重点村的反恶霸斗争，以推动附近的群众进行思想酝酿。待重点村斗争展开后，即迅速将运动加以推广。但有些地方发生了一种偏向，就是许多农会人员都拥挤在一个重点工作的村子里工作，不分散一定数量人员到附近村庄活动，而在重点村的斗争发动起来以后，也不去向附近村庄推广，吸收那里的农民参加，以致运动规模不能扩大，重点村的斗争陷于孤立，农民便胆怯起来，地主就趁机反攻，使运动受到挫折。这一偏向，后来大多已经纠正。许多地方在扩大斗争范围时，采取召开乡、区、县的农民代表大会与积极分子训练班的办法。通过这种形式，使运动迅速扩大到全乡、全区、全县的范围。最近临汝、郏（县）西等县就是这样做法的，并已收到很好的效果。在这样的代表大会上都发动农民诉苦，以启发他们的阶级觉悟，激发他们对土匪恶霸的斗争情绪。各地的诉苦当中，妇女往往起带头作用。这是因为国民党把她们的丈夫儿子抓走之后，使她们的生活失去了依靠，恶霸土匪霸占奸淫等暴行使妇女所受的痛苦特别深重的缘故。
    目前临汝、郏县、实丰、鲁山等地农民反土匪反恶霸的民主斗争，已发展成为全区性、全县性的运动。在这种运动的基础上，已开始建立共产党的农村支部，并逐渐成为农村工作的核心。上述地区的这一运动，对于临近各县已发生了不小的影响。今后只要有正确的领导，充分利用目前军事胜利的影响与闲暇的季节，并总结自己已有的经验，很可能在整个豫西地区造成一个反土匪反恶霸的民主斗争的高潮，把广大群众组织起来，密切共产党与群众的联系，为今后的支援解放战争发展生产和进一步实行社会改革，消灭封建势力奠定群众基础。
