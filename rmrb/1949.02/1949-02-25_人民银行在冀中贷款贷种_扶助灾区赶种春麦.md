　　People's Bank in Central Hebei Provides Loans and Seeds
　　Helping Disaster Areas Rush to Plant Spring Wheat
　　[Our News] In the Eighth Administrative District's flood-stricken areas, most of the land has been drained. In Renqiu, Yiliuzhuangzi, three villages alone have drained twenty hectares of land. In order to enable the masses to plant and harvest early, the district bank convened a meeting of credit section chiefs from various counties on December 27th to study the issue of mobilizing the masses to plant spring wheat, and decided to provide loans for seeds and grain to support them. A total of six counties in the district, including Jinghai, Huanghua, Wenxin, Renqiu, Xianxian, and Jinnan, which were affected by the disaster, were loaned 530,000 catties of grain. Based on the severity of the disaster and the required amount in each region, it has been distributed to the counties and will soon be distributed to the masses. This will solve the seed shortage for approximately 35,333 mu of spring wheat.

　　人民银行在冀中贷款贷种
  　扶助灾区赶种春麦
    【本报消息】八专区水灾地区，大部分土地已经脱出。只任邱一溜庄子三个村就脱出土地二十顷。为了使群众早种早收，专区银行在十二月二十七日召开了各县信用部长会议，研究发动群众种春麦的问题，决定贷种贷粮扶持。全专区受灾县有静海、黄骅、文新、任邱、献县、津南等六个县，共贷粮五十三万斤。根据各地区灾情轻重和需要数目已分配到县，不久即可发给群众。这样约可解决三万五千三百三十三亩春麦籽种困难。
