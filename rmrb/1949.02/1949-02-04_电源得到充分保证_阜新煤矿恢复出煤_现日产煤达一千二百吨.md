Xinhua News Agency, Shenyang, 26th -- With the complete liberation of Northeast China and a guaranteed power supply, the Fuxin Coal Mine in western Liaoning is actively undertaking large-scale restoration work. This mine is one of the major coal mines in Northeast China. According to the "Manchukuo Mining Yearbook" of 1942 under the puppet Manchukuo regime, the mine's reserves are estimated at approximately 4 billion tons. Currently, the mine has over 6,800 employees. Of the 38 mine entrances in the entire mine, 11 have been repaired and are producing coal, with a daily output of approximately 1,200 tons. Thirteen mine entrances are actively undergoing repair work such as water drainage. The remaining 14 mine entrances have been sealed. Additionally, there are two open-pit mines, one of which has resumed coal production, while the other is currently stripping topsoil. The mine encompasses six mines, including Xinqiu, Sunjiawan, and Taiping, as well as machinery and coal washing plants. The mine was recovered by the People's Liberation Army on March 18th of last year. At that time, due to severe famine and its proximity to the war zone, resumption of production was not immediately possible. It was not until May 1st of last year that a mine management committee was established to plan for resumption of work. In early July, some mine entrances began water drainage, but the restoration work was stalled due to the lack of guaranteed power supply. With the complete liberation of Northeast China, the power supply was restored, and the water drainage work in the mines was able to proceed continuously. The maximum power used to operate the machines reached over 10,000 horsepower. Over the past few months, a total of more than 277,000 cubic meters of water has been drained, 92,000 tons of coal have been produced, and 16,000 meters of transportation routes have been restored. The mine's machinery factory has been largely restored, and some of the coal washing machines in the coal washing plant have also been restored. The democratic government has now reorganized the mine's management committee into a mining bureau to strengthen leadership over the restoration and production work of various mines and factories. At the same time, a workers' representative assembly was convened, and a trade union federation was established to widely promote workers' cultural education and welfare work.

　　电源得到充分保证
  　阜新煤矿恢复出煤
  　现日产煤达一千二百吨
    【新华社沈阳廿六日电】由于东北全境解放、电源得到保证，辽西阜新煤矿正积极进行大规模的恢复工作。该矿为东北主要煤矿之一，据一九四二年伪满“满洲矿工年鉴”统计，该矿蕴藏量约四十亿吨。目前，全矿职工有六千八百余名。全矿共三十八个坑口，已有十一个坑口修复出煤，每日产煤约一千二百吨。十三个坑口正积极进行抽水等修复工作。其余十四个坑口则已密闭。另有两个露天矿，一个已恢复出煤，一个则正在剥土。全矿辖有新邱、孙家湾、太平等六矿及机械、选煤两工厂。该矿于去年三月十八日为解放军收复，当时因灾荒严重，且临近战区，一时未能复工生产。直至去年五月一日，始成立矿山管理委员会，筹划复工。七月初，部分坑口开始进行抽水，但因电源无保证，恢复工作时陷停顿状态。及至东北全境解放，电源恢复，坑内抽水工作始得不间断，每日开动机器的动力最多时达一万余匹马力。数月来总计排出水量二十七万七千余立方公尺，产煤九万二千余吨，恢复了一万六千余公尺的运输道。该矿之机器厂已大体恢复，选煤厂的选煤机也有部分恢复。现民主政府已将该矿矿山管理委员会改组为矿务局，以加强对各矿厂的恢复与生产工作的领导。同时召开了职工代表大会，成立职工总会，广泛展开职工文化教育及福利等工作。
