　　Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, February 7th: Reports from various sources indicate that the treacherous act of the right-wing leaders of British, American, and Dutch trade unions in splitting the World Federation of Trade Unions (WFTU) has been opposed by advanced workers in those countries. In Britain, the Executive Committee of the Scottish Area of the National Union of Mineworkers unanimously passed a resolution on the 2nd, expressing its support for the WFTU and condemning the withdrawal from the WFTU by individuals such as Deakin of the British Trades Union Congress (TUC) as benefiting the enemies of the working class. The Annual Meeting of the Yorkshire Trade Unions Committee Federation passed a resolution at the end of January by an overwhelming majority, opposing the TUC's withdrawal from the WFTU and demanding that the TUC reconsider its decision to withdraw. The London South District Committee of the Amalgamated Engineering Union passed a resolution stating that the activities of the TUC leaders were extremely provocative and extremely reactionary. The Chiswick (eastern suburb of London) branch of the Transport and General Workers' Union and the Camberwell (in London) branch of the Amalgamated Society of Woodworkers both passed resolutions condemning the divisive actions of the TUC General Council and demanding that all British trade union members hold a vote on the WFTU issue. In the United States, representatives of five unions of the Congress of Industrial Organizations (CIO): the United Packinghouse Workers of America, the United Mine, Mill and Smelter Workers, the United Farm Equipment and Metal Workers of America, the United Shoe Workers of America, and the International Longshoremen's and Warehousemen's Union, stated at the end of January that they opposed the CIO's departure from the WFTU. In the Netherlands, the Central Executive Committee of the Netherlands Trade Union Federation passed a resolution on the 1st stating that the Executive Committee fully supports the program and constitution of the WFTU and strives to consolidate the unity of the working class and maintain peace, democracy, and progress.
