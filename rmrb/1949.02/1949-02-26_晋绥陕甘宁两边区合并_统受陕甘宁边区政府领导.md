　　Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, February 24th: The joint meeting of the Standing Committee of the Third Session of the Shaanxi-Gansu-Ningxia Border Region Council and the Shaanxi-Gansu-Ningxia Border Region Government Committee, with representatives from the Jin-Sui and Jin-Nan Administrative Offices participating, decided on the 15th of this month to merge the Jin-Sui Border Region with the Shaanxi-Gansu-Ningxia Border Region. The original Jin-Sui Administrative Office will be abolished and divided into the Jin-Northwest and Jin-South Administrative Offices, both under the leadership of the Shaanxi-Gansu-Ningxia Border Region Government. Consequently, the entire Shaanxi-Gansu-Ningxia Border Region has a population of seven million, administering one hundred and eight complete counties, with an area of 260,000 square kilometers. Concurrent with the merger of the two regions, the number of Shaanxi-Gansu-Ningxia Border Region Government Committee members has been increased to thirty-one, including fifteen new members such as Jia Tuofu, Wang Weizhou, Wu Xinyu, and Wang Dacheng. The list of government committee members was also approved by the joint meeting. The Border Region Government structure has been expanded to eight departments, one bank, four committees, and one Border Region People's Court. Council Speaker Gao Gang and Deputy Speaker Xie Juezai of the Border Region Council left their posts due to other matters after the Third Session of the Council in April 1946. Deputy Speaker An Wenqin, due to old age and infirmity, was unable to regularly attend meetings. Upon the joint proposal by Standing Committee members Huo Zhongnian and others, and with the full approval of the joint meeting, Standing Committee member Xi Zhongxun will serve as acting speaker. Border Region Government Chairman Lin Boqu left his post due to other matters, and the joint meeting decided that Liu Jingfan will serve as acting chairman. Those attending this joint meeting included five standing council members of the First Session of the Shaanxi-Gansu-Ningxia Border Region Council, including Xi Zhongxun, An Wenqin, and Fang Wenli; eleven members of the Shaanxi-Gansu-Ningxia Border Region Government Committee, including Liu Jingfan, Yang Mingxuan, and Huo Zhusan; nine representatives from the Jin-Sui Administrative Office; and four representatives from the Jin-Nan Administrative Office.
