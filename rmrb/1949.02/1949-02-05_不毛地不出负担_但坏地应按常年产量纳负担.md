　　Barren Land Exempt from Burden
  　But Bad Land Should Be Taxed According to Normal Yield
To the Editor:
    In the past, barren land was entirely exempt from burden. Due to special circumstances, our village has more than ten acres of barren land. This time, when assessing the public grain burden, all of it was converted into land assessed at 20% of normal yield. All barren land is taxed as if it yields 20% of normal. The villagers in our village are saying, "We are not afraid of heavy public grain, but it is unreasonable to tax barren land as if it yields 20% of normal." The masses are complaining. Please tell me if this practice is reasonable?

Comrade Weijun:
    Barren land is land that does not grow crops, so of course it should not be burdened. According to what you mentioned, your village has more than ten acres of barren land, and this year it is being taxed at 20%. I'm afraid this is because you are treating land with poor soil and small harvests as barren land, and you don't want to bear the burden. This is not right. Regardless of whether the land is good or bad, the standard yield per mu should be assessed according to the normal annual output, and the burden should be paid accordingly. If it is truly barren land, then of course it should not be burdened. Ji County should correct this quickly.

### 不毛地不出负担　但坏地应按常年产量纳负担

　　不毛地不出负担
  　但坏地应按常年产量纳负担编辑同志：
    过去不毛地一律不拿负担，俺村因特殊情况，不毛地差不多有十多顷，这次出公粮负担，一律都变成二成地了，凡不毛地都按二成拿负担，俺村群众反映说：“不怕公粮重，不毛地也按二成拿负担，殊不合理。”群众怨言纷纷。请问这样做法是不是合理？  　樊维钧维钧同志：
    不毛地就是不长庄稼的地，当然不能负担，据你所提你村有不毛地十余顷，今年按二成纳负担，恐怕是把土质坏收成小的土地就当作不毛地看待，而不想出负担，这是不对的，不论好坏地，都应按常年的产量评定标准亩，缴纳负担才对。如果真是不毛地，当然不应出负担，冀县应赶快纠正。
