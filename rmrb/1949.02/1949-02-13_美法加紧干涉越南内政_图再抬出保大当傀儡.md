Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, February 9th: After the Viet Minh General Headquarters announced that the Vietnamese people would achieve a decisive victory in the war of independence this year, the American reactionaries are stepping up their interference, urging the French reactionary authorities to bring out the deposed Vietnamese Emperor Bảo Đại to serve as a puppet emperor again, in order to deceive the Vietnamese people.

The Associated Press quoted British diplomatic officials on January 26th as saying that the US Embassy in Paris had "advised" the French government to "resolve the Vietnamese revolution with a so-called 'nationalist, anti-communist government.'" The official did not conceal that the government suggested by the United States referred to "a Vietnamese government headed by former Emperor Bảo Đại."

Under the instigation of the United States, French High Commissioner to Vietnam, Pignon, together with Nguyễn Văn Xuân, chairman of the Vietnamese puppet government, held a series of "negotiations" with Bảo Đại in Cannes on the French Mediterranean coast in mid-January, urging him to return to Vietnam as soon as possible.

Nguyễn Văn Xuân made no secret of his pessimism about the situation in Vietnam. He told Bảo Đại that the implementation of the treasonous Hạ Long Bay Agreement he signed with France last June depended on Bảo Đại's return to Vietnam, because the puppet government under Nguyễn Văn Xuân's leadership is disintegrating under the impact of the Vietnamese people's victory, and some members of the puppet government are even resigning on the pretext of "needing to conduct further studies abroad."

The French authorities also do not conceal their hope that Bảo Đại's return to Vietnam can ease their serious military situation in Vietnam. Under France's enticement, Bảo Đại reached an agreement with the French on economic and military issues on January 19th, acknowledging the rights that Nguyễn Văn Xuân sold to France in the Hạ Long Bay Agreement. Fearing the power of the Vietnamese people, Bảo Đại had to demand that the French grant the Vietnamese puppet government, which he would serve as a "child emperor," more superficial "freedom," including allowing the puppet government to send diplomatic missions to Southeast Asian countries, so that Bảo Đại could have some political capital to deceive the people after returning to the country.

However, even these pitiful demands of his were rejected by the French because the two sides have not yet reached a final agreement. Nguyễn Văn Xuân returned to Saigon on January 27th, and the negotiations with Bảo Đại are being continued by the French side. According to French Minister of Overseas Territories, Florimond Bonte, on January 26th, this negotiation will "continue until March 15th, the date on which Bảo Đại guarantees to submit a definite reply regarding his return to Vietnam" (Agence France-Presse).

　　美法加紧干涉越南内政
  　图再抬出保大当傀儡
    【新华社陕北九日电】当越盟军总部宣布越南人民将于今年取得独立战争的决定性胜利之后，美国反动派正加紧进行干涉，驱策法国反动当局将越南废皇保大抬出来重当傀儡皇帝，以欺骗越南人民。美联社一月二十六日引英外交官员披露的消息称：美驻巴黎大使馆曾“劝告”法政府以一个所谓“民族主义者的反共政府来解决越南革命问题”，该官员不隐讳美国所建议的此一政府，即系指“由前逊王保大为首的越南政府”。在美方策动之下，法驻越高级专员皮农偕同越南傀儡政府主席阮文春，于一月中旬在法国地中海海岸的坎城与保大进行一系列的“谈判”，促其尽速返越。阮文春毫不掩盖他对越南局势的悲观。他向保大表示，他于去年六月与法国签订的阿朗湾卖国协定的实现，端赖保大之返越，因目前阮文春领导下的傀儡政府，在越南人民胜利的冲击之下，内部正分崩离析，若干傀儡政府人员，甚至借口“需在国外作进一步之研讨”而相继离职。法国当局亦不隐讳他们希望保大的返越，能够缓和他们在越南的严重军事局面。在法国的勾引下，保大已于一月十九日与法方在经济与军事问题上达成协议，承认阮文春于阿朗湾协定中卖予法国的权利，将因慑于越南人民力量的强大，保大又不得不要求法方赠予他将出任“儿皇帝”的越南傀儡政府以较多的表面的“自由”色彩，包括允许傀儡政府有权派遣外交使团驻东南亚各国，以便使保大返国后，能有一些欺骗人民的政治资本。但是，甚至他的这些可怜的要求，亦被法方拒绝了。因为，双方尚未达成最后协议。阮文春已于一月二十七日返抵西贡，与保大的谈判，正由法方继续进行中。据法国政府海外部长佛洛里于一月二十六日宣称：这一谈判将“继续至三月十五日，即保大保证就返越事提出确定答复之日期”（法新社）。
