Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, February 18th: TASS, Moscow, February 13th: Pravda commentator Malinin commented on the remarks of Italian Prime Minister Gasperi, stating: Gasperi and his Christian Democratic Party members are painstakingly trying to confuse the Italian people and disorient them. Gasperi and Foreign Minister Sforza are extremely familiar with the entire system of military-political blocs established by American expansionists. They have long known that these blocs have an irrefutable aggressive nature. Italian Chief of Staff Marius has already participated in Washington in drafting certain specific clauses of the North Atlantic Treaty. In view of the people's opposition, the Italian ruling clique feels that they cannot yet directly don the shackles of the North Atlantic Treaty, so they gladly put their necks into the shackles of the "European Council." Regarding Italy's participation in the "European Council," Gasperi issued the sophistry: "Italy is emerging from a state of isolation." However, the question is: Where is it going? What path is it taking? Let the clever masters of sophistry refute the undeniable truth! A bunch of pitiful lackeys are waiting for Italy in the arms of the Anglo-American aggressive bloc. If some Italian politicians believe that this prospect means national security, then what national independence is left?

　　力谋迷乱意国人民加斯贝利妄作诡辩
  　真理报特予斥责
    【新华社陕北十八日电】塔斯社莫斯科十三日讯：真理报评论员马里宁评论意大利总理加斯贝利的谈话称：加斯贝利及其基督教民主党徒处心积虑地力谋迷乱意大利人民，使之不辨方向。加斯贝利和外长史佛卓对于美国扩张主义者所建立的军事政治集团的整个体系极为熟悉。他们早已知道：这些集团具有确切不移的侵略性质。意大利参谋总长马留斯已在华盛顿参加过起草北大西洋公约中的某些具体条款。鉴于人民的反对，意大利统治集团感到他们现在还不能直接戴上北大西洋公约的枷锁，于是，他们就欣然地把他们的颈子套进“欧洲委员会”的枷锁中。关于意大利参加“欧洲委员会”一事，加斯贝利发出诡辩说：“意大利正自孤立状态中脱颖而出。”但是，问题在于：它走向那里去？它采取的是什么道路？让诡辩派的聪明大师来反驳无法否认的真理吧！一班可怜的喽罗们正在美英侵略集团的怀抱里等待着意大利。假如意大利某些政客认为这种前途是意味着国家的安全，那么，还有一点什么国家独立呢？
