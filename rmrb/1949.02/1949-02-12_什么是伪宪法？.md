　　What is a Pseudo-Constitution?
　　Editor:
　　While studying Chairman Mao's statement on the current situation on January 14th, I am still unclear about the second of the eight peace conditions: "Abolish the pseudo-constitution." Does this pseudo-constitution refer to the "May 5th Draft," or is there another pseudo-constitution? When and how was this pseudo-constitution formulated? I hope you can explain it to me.
　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　Reader Chen Zhiming, February 2nd
Zhiming Comrade:
　　We will briefly answer your questions as follows:
　　The pseudo-constitution refers to the pseudo-"Constitution of the Republic of China." The "May 5th Draft" is a draft of the pseudo-"Constitution of the Republic of China" (because it was announced on May 5, 1936, it is also called the "May 5th Draft"). After the pseudo-Constitution of the Republic of China was "officially" formulated and "promulgated," the "May 5th Draft" naturally ceased to exist.
　　The "May 5th Draft" was a constitutional draft that openly supported the counter-revolutionary dictatorship of the big bourgeoisie and was unanimously opposed by the people of the whole country after its promulgation. After the victory of the Anti-Japanese War, in January 1946, the CCP and other democratic parties, in order to strive for a peaceful nation-building situation, agreed with the Kuomintang in the Political Consultative Conference on the principles for revising the constitutional draft. However, when the Kuomintang reactionaries tore up other resolutions of the Political Consultative Conference and implemented the counter-revolutionary civil war, they also tore up this resolution on revising the constitutional draft. On November 15, 1946, amid the tide of the national people's declaration of firm opposition, Chiang Kai-shek convened the pseudo-"National Assembly" (of the more than 1,600 "representatives" in this assembly, 85 percent were Kuomintang, more than 900 representatives were old "representatives" elected ten years ago with notorious reputations, and the others were new "representatives" newly "selected" by the Kuomintang government, as well as the Youth Party and the Democratic Socialist Party who had sold themselves to the Kuomintang as vassals and a few "social celebrities" who had fallen into the water—see the Liberation Daily's report on the illegal "National Assembly"), personally directing his group of anti-people lackeys to give the "May 5th Draft" a makeover, and "passed it at the third reading" on December 25 of the same year. On January 1, the 36th year of the Republic of China, it was "officially promulgated." This is the process by which the pseudo-"Constitution of the Republic of China" was produced.

### 什么是伪宪法？

专栏：询问与答复

　　什么是伪宪法？编辑同志：
    我在学习一月十四日毛主席发表的时局声明中，对于八项和平条件的第二项：“废除伪宪法”，还弄不明白：这个伪宪法是不是指的“五五宪草”，或另有一个伪宪法？这个伪宪法，是什么时候，怎样订定的？希望你能给我解释一下。
    　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　读者　陈志明　二月二日志明同志：
    你所提出的问题，我们简复如下：
    伪宪法，是指的伪“中华民国宪法”。“五五宪草”，是伪“中华民国宪法”的一个草案（因为它是一九三六年五月五日公布的，所以也叫“五五宪草”）。自伪中华民国宪法“正式”制定、“颁布”后，“五五宪草”当然就不复存在了。
    “五五宪草”，是一部公开拥护大资产阶级反革命独裁的宪草，公布以后曾受到全国人民的一致反对。抗日战争胜利后，在一九四六年一月间，中共以及其他民主党派，为了争取和平建国的局面，曾在政治协商会议中，与国民党商定了关于修改宪法草案的原则。但是国民党反动派在撕毁政治协商会议其他决议并实行反革命内战的时候，也撕毁了这个关于修改宪草的决议。一九四六年十一月十五日，蒋介石在全国人民声明坚决反对的浪潮中，召集了伪“国民大会”，（这个大会一千六百多名“代表”中，百分之八十五是国民党，九百多个代表是声明狼籍的，十年前选出的旧“代表”，其他就是国民党政府新近“遴选”的新“代表”，另外还有卖身投靠国民党作了附庸的青年党、民社党及几名落水的“社会贤达”。——见解放日报关于非法“国大”的报导）亲自指挥他的一群反人民的喽罗们，把“五五宪草”来了一次改头换面，在同年十二月二十五日“三读通过”。民国三十六年一月一日，“正式颁布”出来。这就是伪“中华民国宪法”的产生经过。
