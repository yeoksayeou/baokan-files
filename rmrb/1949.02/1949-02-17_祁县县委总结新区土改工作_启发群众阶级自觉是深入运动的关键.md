　　Qi County Party Committee Sums Up New District Land Reform Work
    Inspiring Mass Class Consciousness Is Key to Deepening the Movement
    [Jinzhong News] In late January, the Qi County Party Committee summarized the land reform work in the new district over the past twenty-odd days. The County Party Committee pointed out that the land reform in the new district has been successful. After 25 days of work, the masses in 30 township-level villages have been initially mobilized. Most of the struggles are nearing completion, and the distribution of fruits has begun. At the beginning of the movement, the masses had many concerns in their minds: for example, many middle peasants misunderstood "land reform" as "absolute egalitarianism" and were afraid of struggle; some poor peasants also had thoughts of "change of dynasty" and "conscience." Through repeated publicity of policies and recounting grievances, the ideological awareness of the broad masses has been raised a step further, they have actively taken action, and a large number of activists have emerged in the struggle, establishing their own organizations. According to statistics from 29 villages, 13,359 people (including 5,757 women) participated in the peasant associations (accounting for 47 percent of the total number of peasants). 1,366 male and female activists emerged during the movement. However, the movement also exposed many shortcomings: First, due to insufficient and profound understanding of the land reform policy, "leftist" or "rightist" sprouts have begun to appear among some cadres and masses. This is reflected in the "prohibition of indiscriminate beatings and killings." Some comrades did not dare to publicize this boldly, so that beatings still occurred in some villages; some comrades only publicized the "prohibition of indiscriminate beatings and killings," but did not emphasize that if landlords opposed land reform and refused to hand over weapons, the people have the right to file complaints with the people's court, resulting in some landlords daring to exploit loopholes and resist land reform. On the issue of class division, some comrades still have the remnants of the idea of "investigating three generations" and fighting history, and the idea of fighting "wealth," and regard "political outlook" as a condition for class division, etc., which are "leftist" tendencies. In some villages, individual despotic elements with heinous crimes were not sanctioned in a timely manner, which affected the masses' courage to become active. Some villages did not dare to boldly publicize the land reform line of "relying on poor and hired peasants to unite with middle peasants." Second, some regions and some cadres still have narrow empiricism and blindness in their work. There are two different manifestations: one is that they do not look at the level of awareness of the masses, mechanically grasp the stage of the movement, and are limited to individual visits to poor and hired laborers for a long time, and fail to carry out extensive publicity in a timely manner, and combine it with organizational struggle, which affects the development of the movement; the other is that they do not believe in the power of the masses, combine with the actual situation to enlighten the masses' consciousness, but instead take over and replace them, and use formalism to launch the mass struggle. Third, some cadres believe that the masses have been mobilized, and are satisfied with the temporary hustle and bustle, and produce complacency. Based on the above situation, the County Party Committee pointed out that the next stage of work policy, generally speaking, is to overcome complacency, deepen the movement, and in the struggle, in the distribution of fruits, to fully mobilize all peasants from the ideological and organizational aspects, strive to complete the land reform on time, and complete the construction of the party, government, and league in the above-mentioned movement. And every cadre must realize that the arduous and in-depth enlightenment of the masses' class consciousness is the key to deepening the movement and successfully completing the land reform. In addition, the County Party Committee also put forward clear opinions on several specific issues: First, "relying on poor and hired peasants and uniting with middle peasants" is not a technical issue, but must be combined with the actual life experience of the masses to enlighten the masses' class consciousness, so that the unity of middle and poor peasants is built on the basis of ideological consciousness. Second, the mobilization of women must be carried out at the same time as men, and women's meetings need to be held, and male peasants should be organized to go home to mobilize the women in their families. In particular, their ideological awareness should be enlightened from the suffering of women themselves. However, it must be noted that when guiding women to recount their grievances, they should not discuss matters as they are, and hate whoever they are angry with. Women's class consciousness should be enlightened, and they should realize that all the suffering of women is caused by the feudal society and the landlord class. Therefore, they should work together with male peasants to completely eliminate feudalism. Otherwise, it will cause internal contradictions among peasants and affect the struggle against landlords. Third, the distribution of fruits should clarify the principle of "filling up the gaps and making up for the deficiencies," and implement production education for getting rich, educating the masses to cherish the fruits and lay the foundation for developing production. The method of distributing fruits can be discussed by the People's Congress, put forward a plan, submitted to the masses for discussion, and then decided by the People's Congress. The upper-level district leadership can educate the masses in rich villages on "all poor people in the world are one family," and let them leave more land so that the adjustment of poor and rich villages can be carried out in a planned manner.

### 祁县县委总结新区土改工作  启发群众阶级自觉是深入运动的关键

　　祁县县委总结新区土改工作
    启发群众阶级自觉是深入运动的关键
    【晋中讯】上月下旬祁县县委总结二十余天的新区土地改革工作。县委指出新区土改是有成绩的，经过廿五天的工作，已有三十个乡政村的群众初步发动起来了，大部分斗争已快结束，并已开始分果实。在运动开始时，群众思想上曾有着许多顾虑：如有不少中农曾把“土地改革”误解为“绝对平均”，存在着怕斗争的思想；部分贫农也存在着“变天”思想和“良心”观念。经过反复宣传政策、诉苦，使广大群众的思想觉悟提高了一步，积极行动起来，并在斗争中涌现了大批积极分子，建立了自己的组织。据二十九个村的统计，有一万三千三百五十九人（内有妇女五千七百五十七人），参加了农民协会（占农民总人数的百分之四十七）。运动中涌出男女积极分子一千三百六十六人。但运动也暴露了不少缺点：一、由于对土改政策了解不够全面深刻，在部分干部、群众中开始产生了“左”或“右”的萌芽。表现在“禁止乱打乱杀”问题上，有的同志不敢大胆宣传，以致有些村仍发生打人现象；有的同志只宣传了“禁止乱打乱杀”，而没有强调如果地主反对土改，抗不交械，人民有权向人民法庭控诉的一面，以致发生某些地主敢于钻空子，反抗土改的现象。在划阶级问题上，部分同志仍存有“查三代”斗历史的思想残余，和斗“富”思想，把“政治面貌”作为划阶级的条件等“左”的倾向。有些村庄对个别罪大恶极的奸霸分子，没有及时给予制裁，以致影响群众不敢积极起来。有些村不敢大胆宣传“依靠贫雇农团结中农”的土改路线。二、部分地区、部分干部在工作中还存在狭隘的经验主义与盲目性。有着两种不同的表现：一种是不看群众的觉悟程度，机械的掌握运动阶段，长期限于个别访问贫雇，而未能及时作广泛宣传，并与组织斗争相结合，影响运动的向前发展；另一种是不相信群众力量，结合实际启发群众的自觉，而是包办代替、形式主义的去发动群众斗争。三、也有部分干部认为群众有了发动，满足于一时的轰轰烈烈，产生自满情绪。根据以上情况，县委指出下一段的工作方针，总起来讲是克服自满情绪，深入运动，在斗争中、在分配果实中，要把全部农民从思想上、组织上充分发动起来，争取按时结束土改，并在上述运动中完成建党、建政、建团等各项建设工作。而每个干部必须认识到艰苦的深入的启发群众阶级自觉，即是深入运动胜利完成土改的关键。另外在几个具体问题上县委也提出了明确意见：一、“依靠贫雇农，团结中农”不是技术问题，必须是结合群众实际的生活经历，启发群众的阶级自觉，使中贫农的团结建筑在思想自觉的基础上。二、妇女的发动必须和男人同时发动，需要召开妇女会议，和组织男农民回家发动家中的妇女。特别应从妇女本身痛苦，来启发其思想觉悟。但必须注意，引导妇女诉苦时，不能就事论事，受谁的气仇恨谁，应启发妇女的阶级自觉，认识到妇女的一切痛苦，都是封建社会地主阶级造成的，因之应和男农民共同努力彻底消灭封建。否则，便会引起农民内部矛盾，影响对地主的斗争。三、分配果实应明确“填平补齐”的原则，并贯彻发家致富的生产教育，教育群众爱护果实，打下发展生产的基础。分果实的方法，可由人代会讨论后，提出方案，交群众讨论，再由人代会决定。区领导上可向富村群众进行“天下穷人是一家”的教育，让其多留下土地，以便有计划的进行穷富村的调剂。　　　　　　　　　　　　　　（祁县县委会）
