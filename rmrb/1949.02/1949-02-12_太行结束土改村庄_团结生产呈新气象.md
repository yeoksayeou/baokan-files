　　Taihang Villages Complete Land Reform
  　Unity and Production Present a New Look
    [Taihang Electric Dispatch] Since the beginning of September last year, the villages in the region that have completed land reform, due to the basically correct implementation of policies and the attention paid to production and prosperity education during the movement, have witnessed a general increase in the production enthusiasm of the masses from all walks of life, presenting a new picture of unity and production in the countryside. According to materials from fourteen counties, including Zanhuang, Heshun, Xiyang, Xiangyuan, Yushe, Zuoquan, Licheng, Pingshun, Huguan, Changzhi, Lingchuan, Shahe, Shexian, and Linxian, this is specifically reflected in: First, the masses are generally increasing the purchase of livestock in preparation for a major production year. Statistics from 375 villages in the above-mentioned fourteen counties show an increase of 4,677 head of livestock. The Xiangyuan County Cooperative bought 32 head of livestock for the masses in Northwest Shanxi, and the Nangou Village Cooperative also helped the masses buy 12 head of livestock. The masses in Nanwang Village, Cixian County, mutually assisted in buying 15 head of livestock. Beizhang Village in Shahe County bought a total of 26 head of livestock, accounting for 12% of the village's original livestock. Xue Zhenlu of Xue Village only fed half a head of cattle before the land reform. Although he had money, he was afraid of struggle and did not dare to buy more. After the end of land reform and compensation to the middle peasants, he bought a donkey and a horse.

    Second, winter production is particularly vigorous. The masses have achieved great results through organized transportation, textile, and various workshop activities. According to statistics from 242 villages in the fourteen counties, transportation earned 2,197,604.5 yuan (People's Currency, same below). Various handicraft workshops in 228 villages earned 2,477,374.8 yuan. Women in 145 villages spun a total of 10,813 jin of cotton and wove 15,449 jin of cloth. In Licheng County, all male and female laborers were involved in the winter production movement. Fifty-one villages were organized, led, and planned, exceeding any previous year. In Changxing Village, Huguan, 134 laborers were organized to find production opportunities, truly ensuring that there were no idle people in winter. In Beicheng Village, Changzhi, more than 70% of the male and female laborers were organized in winter production. Beizhang Village in Shahe County organized six small mutual aid groups to burn lime, and has now burned 275,000 jin, which can yield a profit of 125,950 yuan. Li Changgeng of Xicui Village was afraid of struggle before the land reform and did not dare to produce, burying 100 jin of cotton. After the end of land reform, he recognized the production policy and took out the buried 100 jin of cotton for women to spin and weave, and planned to replace the bad livestock with good livestock. In Honghe Village, Linxian County, five women in Wang Xinquan's family bought a donkey after a month of spinning and weaving.

    Third, actively accumulate fertilizer, collect firewood, and repair farm tools to prepare for this year's production. A total of 2,682,375 dan of fertilizer were accumulated in 123 villages. According to statistics from five districts in Licheng County: 4,235,536 jin of firewood were collected. Niuling Village in Pingshun repaired 190 farm tools. In Honghe Village, Linxian County, 90 households collected 300,000 jin of firewood, enough for half a year's burning.

    Fourth, repair houses, build houses, and establish a career. Statistics from twelve villages in Linxian and Licheng County show that eighty new houses were built, one hundred and twenty roofs were replaced, and eighty-one kilns were repaired. For example, in Shiganjia Village in Linxian County, twenty new houses were built. Yang Derong of Guanzhuang Village prepared stones for repairing the house five years ago, but did not repair it because he did not recognize the production policy in his mind. After the end of land reform, he hired people to make adobe for five houses in preparation for building new houses.

　　太行结束土改村庄
  　团结生产呈新气象
    【太行电】全区从去年九月初开始至现在，凡结束了土改的村庄，由于执行政策基本上是端正的，运动中又注意了生产发家的前途教育，因而各阶层群众生产情绪普遍高涨，农村里呈现出一片团结生产的新气象。据赞皇、和顺、昔阳、襄垣、榆社、左权、黎城、平顺、壶关、长治、陵川、沙河、涉县、林县等十四个县的材料了解，具体表现在：一、群众普遍的增买牲口，准备今年大生产。上述十四个县三百七十五个村统计，共增买牲口四千六百七十七头。襄垣县联社到晋西北给群众买牲口三十二头，南沟村合作社亦帮助群众买牲口十二头。磁县南王村群众互助买牲口十五头。沙河北掌村共买牲口廿六头，占全村原有牲口百分之十二。薛庄村薛振路土改前只喂牛半头，虽然有钱但因害怕斗争不敢买，经结束土改补偿中农后，他就买了一驴一马。
    二、冬季生产特别起劲。群众经过组织起来进行运输、纺织及各种作坊活动，获得了很大成绩。据十四个县二百四十二个村的统计，运输赚洋二百一十九万七千六百零四元五角（人民券下同）。二百二十八个村的各种手工业作坊获利二百四十七万七千三百七十四元八角。一百四十五个村的妇女共纺花一万零八百一十三斤，织布一万五千四百四十九斤。黎城全县男女劳力都卷入了冬季生产运动，有五十一个村是有组织、有领导、有计划的进行，超过了已往任何一年。壶关常行村一百三十四个劳力都组织起来找下生产门路，真正做到了冬季没闲人。长治北城村男女劳力，在冬季生产中组织到百分之七十以上。沙河北掌村组织了六个小型互助社烧石灰，现已烧出二十七万五千斤，共能获利一十二万五千九百五十元。西崔村李常更在土改前怕斗争不敢生产，埋了棉花一百斤，经结束土改后，认识了生产政策，才把埋的一百斤棉花拿出来让妇女们纺织，并计划把坏牲口换个好牲口。林县洪河村王新全家五个妇女，经过一个月纺织就买了毛驴一头。
    三、积极积肥、打柴、修理农具，为今年生产长一寸作准备。据一百二十三个村共积了肥二百六十八万二千三百七十五担。据黎城五个区统计：打柴四百二十三万五千五百三十六斤，平顺牛岭村修理农具一百九十件。林县洪河村九十户共打柴三十万斤，可够今年半年烧。
    四、修房盖屋，兴家立业。林县、黎城十二个村统计，盖新房八十间，换房顶一百二十间，修理窑八十一座。如林县石甘家村新盖房二十间，管庄村杨德荣在前五年准备下修房石头，因思想上对生产政策不认识没有修盖，经结束土改后，用人打了五间房的土坯，准备盖新房。
