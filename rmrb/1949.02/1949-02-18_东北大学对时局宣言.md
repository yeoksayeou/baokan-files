　　Xinhua News Agency, Northeast, 14th. The Northeastern University Faculty and Staff Union, Student Union, and the Northeastern University Branch of the New Democratic Youth League issued a declaration on the current situation on the 7th, which stated in brief:
　　The Northeast is completely liberated. After the liberation of Beiping and Tianjin, North China has also been basically completely liberated. This is an unprecedented great victory in the history of the Chinese revolution. This victory is the result of the arduous struggle of the Chinese people under the correct leadership of the Chinese Communist Party and the people's leader Mao Zedong for the past twenty-odd years, and the result of the heroic and skillful fighting of all commanders and fighters of the People's Liberation Army. Wherever the People's Liberation Army goes, the people offer food and drink and cheer along the way; even in places where the People's Liberation Army has not yet arrived, the people have prepared gifts of appreciation and welcoming flags. The enemy, however, is afraid of this victory, so a small gray flag is raised over Nanjing, called "peace talks." In reality, this is a conspiracy, a delaying tactic, and we must expose this trick. We love peace, but we love true peace, the people's peace, and lasting peace, peace obtained after clearing all obstacles to peace and factors of war. That peace is the peace based on the eight conditions announced by the people's leader Comrade Mao Zedong on January 14th. We warmly support Chairman Mao's statement. That statement is the charter of the people's peace and is not allowed to be discounted in the slightest. Only by fully realizing it can peace be guaranteed.

　　东北大学对时局宣言
    【新华社东北十四日电】东北大学教职员联合会、学生会、新民主主义青年团东北大学分团于七日发表对时局宣言，略谓：
    东北完全解放了。北平、天津解放后，华北基本上也已完全解放了。这是中国革命史上空前的伟大胜利。这胜利是廿几年来中国人民在中国共产党和人民的领袖毛泽东正确领导下艰苦奋斗的结果，是人民解放军全体指战员英勇善战的结果。人民解放军大军所到，处处都是箪食壶浆，夹道欢呼；人民解放军还没有到的地方，老百姓也准备好了慰劳的礼物，欢迎的旗帜。敌人对这胜利却是惧怕的，于是南京城头打出一面灰色小旗，名曰“和谈”。其实这是阴谋，这是缓兵之计，我们要揭穿这一套鬼蜮伎俩。我们爱和平，但我们爱的是真正的和平，人民的和平，永远的和平，是肃清了一切和平障碍和战争的因素以后所获得的和平。那和平就是以一月十四日人民领袖毛泽东同志所宣布的八项条件为基础的和平。我们热烈拥护毛主席的声明。那声明是人民和平的宪章，是不允许有丝毫折扣的。只有全部实现它，和平才能有保障。
