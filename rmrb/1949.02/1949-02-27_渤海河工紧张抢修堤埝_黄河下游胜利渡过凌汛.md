Xinhua News Agency, East China, 23rd: Delayed news: The ice flood in the lower reaches of the Yellow River has been successfully overcome. Since the 26th of last month, the weather has gradually warmed up, and the Yellow River below Qihe gradually thawed. A large number of ice floes successively blocked the dangerous sections of Liu Chun's home in Gaoqing (newly established county, merged from the original Gaoyuan and Qingcheng), Daoxu and Mawan in Putai, and Quanjiazui in Lijin, preventing the river water from flowing freely. At noon on the 30th of last month, the water level at the Zhang Xiaotang dangerous section in Bin County rose sharply, and the Daoxu dangerous section embankment was only one meter above the water surface. The Shandong Provincial River Affairs Bureau and the Bohai Administrative Office immediately issued orders to all counties along the Yellow River to strictly protect against this. The River Affairs Bureau also sent ice blasting teams to carry out ice blasting and water diversion work. The water situation within Putai was relatively urgent. County cadres led river workers to the embankment, and nearly a thousand laborers rushed to build a hundred-meter river embankment to defend against the rising river water. After seven days and nights of intense rescue and protection, all the ice water in the river flowed smoothly into the sea, and the river water returned to its channel.

　　渤海河工紧张抢修堤埝
    黄河下游胜利渡过凌汛
    【新华社华东二十三日电】迟到消息：黄河下游凌汛已胜利渡过。自上月二十六日起天气渐暖，黄河由齐河以下逐渐开冻，大量冰块先后堵塞在高清（新设县，原高苑、清城合并者）之刘春家，蒲台的道旭、麻湾，利津的全家咀等险工处，使河水不得渲泄，上月三十日中午，滨县张肖堂险工水位陡涨，道旭险工大堤仅露出水面一公尺。山东省河务局、渤海行署当即通令沿黄河各县严加防护。河务局并派出爆冰队，进行爆冰疏水工作。蒲台境内水情较为紧急，该县干部率领河工人员上堤，近千民工抢筑百米河埝，防御河水漫涨。经过七昼夜的紧张抢护以后，全河冰水乃畅流入海，河水归槽。
