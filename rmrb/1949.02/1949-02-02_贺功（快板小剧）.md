　　He Gong (Quick-Clapper Drama)
    Collectively created by the Qianjin Factory Amateur Theater Troupe
    Written by Zhang Zhang and Wei Guo
    Characters: Zhang, Wang, Li, Zhao (workers), a secretary, a model worker.
    Time: 1949, competition summary day.
    (Gongs and drums open the scene, Zhang enters holding a large tap.)
    Zhang: (Quick Clapper) Happy New Year, Happy New Year, today's New Year is different from the past. Workers in the old society were like cattle and horses, but now workers are masters. We manage our own affairs, and we must cherish our factory. The higher-ups called for a competition, and the whole factory launched a major production drive. This workshop issued a challenge, that workshop set a plan. Everyone helps each other, voluntarily striving to be models. All for the sake of making the competition joyful, promoting new creations, advocating new inventions. Everyone judges who is good and who is bad. After several days of evaluation, the water recedes and heroes appear. Today is the summary, the factory will award prizes. Everyone works hard and加油 (jiāyóu - add oil, work harder), learn from heroes and strive to be model workers. It's getting late, let's get going, to congratulate them for their achievements, to congratulate them for their achievements. (Interlude)
    (Wang enters holding a hammer, Li enters holding a turning tool)
    Wang, Li (together): The competition lasted for half a month, taking the lead in all work. Working methods have been improved, everyone offers suggestions, select him to be a model worker, the hero's banner is even more obvious, everyone works hard with one heart.
    Li: No complaining, no slacking off.
    Wang: All the bad habits of the old society, completely eliminated.
    Li: Promote the good style of unity and mutual assistance of the working class.
    Wang: Implement the good traditions of the proletariat.
    Li: Everyone does the work, everyone overcomes difficulties.
    Wang, Li: Respond to the call to increase production, defeat Chiang Kai-shek and enjoy peace.
    (Interlude) Today's summary must be clear, we will congratulate the model worker for their achievements.
    (They meet Zhang on the way) Old Zhang, Old Zhang, listen, everyone is going to congratulate them, what are you doing with the tap?
    Zhang: Old Wang, Old Li, listen to me, I'm also here to congratulate them. The tap has great significance, give it to the hero. The locomotive uses a tap, work efficiency will definitely be greatly improved. This gift is for the repair shop, work improvements will definitely have a way.
    Wang: (Unconvinced) Oh! Oh! You say the tap has great significance, and is useful on the locomotive. I think it's not as useful as my hammer. Speaking of the vehicle depot, the hammer belongs to it. With a hammer, all passenger cars and freight cars are repaired. The vehicle depot is very capable, building passenger cars and freight cars all depends on it. It can load goods, and also move people. Riding in a passenger car is like being at home. Passengers can have食堂 (shítáng - canteen) when they're hungry, and sleeping berths when they're sleepy. Everything used and eaten is worry-free. If you want to go to Jinan, just take the passenger car! If you want to use goods, load the goods and they'll arrive! Tell me, how big is the role of my hammer in the vehicle depot?!
    Li: (Hearing them both bragging a bit, he is even more unconvinced)
    Oh, oh, don't be proud, even sparrows can be compared to crows, our machine shop's ability is also not bad. Your locomotive can pull cars, our vehicles can carry goods. Without the parts supplied by our shop, your locomotive can't even be used, and your vehicles can't transport passengers and goods either. Speaking of it, the work of our shop is really complicated, drilling holes, turning, washing beds, planing beds, adding extra work. The parts of each shop are well-matched, as long as your shop bows to me, our shop really has no problem, we will try our best to help you. If you are not convinced, let's talk about it.
    Zhang: (Even more unconvinced)
    Hey, hey, you're bragging a lot, don't blow the sky down. Our repair shop is very capable. When the locomotive enters the factory, everyone is busy and happy. You repair pipes, I repair pumps, the axle doesn't move, wipe the oil sludge, disassembling the air pump is a major repair. We're busy all day and night. If the train doesn't leave the factory for a day, tickets can't be sold for a day, passengers are chattering all day long, and the impact on transportation is terrible. The arrival of the train all depends on me. Without me, you're all talking nonsense.
    Wang: (Saying more urgently)
    If a train doesn't have carriages, then it's useless. Without my vehicle depot, you can't pull anything.
    Zhao: (Hearing them arguing and rushing on)
    What's the matter? What's the matter? What are you chattering about?
    Zhang: Old Zhao, Old Zhao, you came at the right time, can you judge for us? I said that the main function of the machine factory is to repair locomotives. Without a locomotive, the entire machine factory cannot survive.
    Wang: It's not good to have a locomotive, it's just empty talk to have no carriages.
    Li: No need to say anything else, without parts, no work can be done.
    Zhao: (Saying very proudly)
    Oh dear, oh dear, I thought it was for something, turns out you're arguing about this, listen to our motor shop, if the motor shop doesn't generate electricity, no shop's work can operate. Our gifts are really big, if you don't agree, let's all compare.
    Zhang, Wang, Li: (Looking at each other in surprise)
    (Sing) This guy is really foolish, we called you to judge, who called you to stir up trouble.
    Zhang: No need to say anything, without a locomotive, the railway can't survive, without the motor shop, you're all talking nonsense.
    Wang: Without carriages, you can't pull anything.
    Li: Without parts, what will you repair when your car is broken?
    (Just as they are all bragging, the secretary enters)
    Secretary: It's not good, it's not good, our locomotive and carriages are all broken, no work can be done.
    Zhang, Wang: (Asking in surprise)
    How are the locomotive and carriages all broken? Why aren't they being repaired?
    Secretary: The locomotive and carriages are being repaired, but without parts, it won't work either.
    Li: What are you afraid of without parts? Our shop can make them.
    Secretary: Don't mention it, don't mention it, the electricity in the whole factory is gone again, how can anything be repaired!
    Zhao: What's wrong with having no electricity? Why isn't my shop generating electricity?
    Secretary: Electricity can be generated, but we're contending for model workers, we're preparing not to generate electricity for three days.
    All: (Laugh) Secretary, Secretary, you're really joking.
    Secretary: This is no joke, one person can't do anything, the whole factory's affairs are divided and done together, without that shop, work can't be done. You must know that mutual assistance can make achievements.
    Secretary: Old Zhang's gift is good, the locomotive's task has been completed, the vehicles can then run. Old Wang's gift is wonderful, the vehicle's task has been completed brilliantly.
    Old Li and Old Zhao's gifts are good, all the parts have been repaired, once the motor moves, all the factory's machinery can operate. Everyone helps each other, even the biggest task can be completed well. All difficulties are overcome, mutual assistance will achieve merits.
    All: That's right! Mutual assistance strengthens us, we must overcome all difficulties.
    Zhang: Talking and talking, I forgot, the summary conference has begun, quickly go and give the gifts, dedicate them to the model workers first.
    (Everyone twists across the stage, model worker enters)
    Secretary: Everyone says you're the model worker, don't forget, don't forget, heroes lead the masses to work, don't be proud, improve technology in all aspects, everyone should learn from each other humbly, and do a good job in future work. These gifts are for you, please accept them, everyone is happy.
    Model Worker: The gifts are accepted, the task must be done well.
    Secretary: Heroes lead the way, (All sing together) the masses 加劲 (jiājìn - work harder) behind.
    Zhang: The competition movement is greatly launched,
    Wang: Working methods must be improved.
    Li: Improve production efficiency,
    Zhao: Improve technology, strengthen learning.
    Secretary: Make the work greatly developed.
    Model Worker: Everyone invent more, improve with one heart.
    All: To make everyone have blessings to enjoy, increase production to support the front, fight Lao Jiang (Chiang Kai-Shek). If you want to be a hero, you can only work hard! Strive to be a model worker! We'll meet again at the next summary meeting. (Twisting across the stage and exiting)

    人物：张、王、李、赵（工人）、秘书一名、英模一名。
    时间：一九四九年，竞赛总结日。
    锣鼓敲开场，张持大缧丝把上。
    张：（快板）过新年，过新年，现在的新年不同前，旧社会的工人是牛马，现在的工人作主人，自己的事自己来办，自己的工厂要爱护它，上级号召来竞赛，全厂展开大生产，这所在挑战，那所定计划，大家互助干，自动争模范，全为竞赛搞的欢，发扬新创造，提倡新发明，谁好谁坏大家评。评功评了几天整，水落石出现英雄。今天来总结，厂部来奖评，大家努力加油干，学习英雄争取当模范。天气不早快动身，去给他们来贺功，去给他们来贺功。（过门）
    （王持榔头，李持旋刀上）
    王、李（同说）：竞赛赛了一月半，一切工作代头干。工作办法有改善，大家提意见，选他当模范，英雄旗帜更明显，大家齐心努力干。
    李：不讲怪话，不偷懒。
    王：一切旧社会的恶习惯，一概除掉完。
    李：发扬工人阶级团结互助好作风。
    王：贯彻无产阶级的好传统。
    李：工作大家都来干，困难大家来克服。
    王李：响应号召来增产，打垮蒋贼享太平。
    （过门）今天总结要说清，我们去给模范贺个功。
    （当时过门遇见张）老张老张你听听，大家去贺功，你拿螺丝把，那是干什么用？
    张：老王，老李你们听，我也是来贺功。螺丝把，意义大，送给英雄他，火车头用螺丝把，工作效力一定大，这个礼物送给装修所，工作改进一定有办法。
    王：（不服气）唉呀！唉呀！你说螺丝把用意大，用在车头气力大。我看不如我的榔头作用大，提起车辆所，榔头就属它，榔头一下手，客车货车全修好；车辆所是本领大，造出客车货车全靠它，能装货物，又能替人搬家，坐上客车，就象到了家，旅客饿了有食堂，旅客困了有睡铺，一切用的吃的都不愁啦：你想到济南，坐上客车就走啦！你想用货物，装上货物就到啦！你说我的榔头，在车辆所起作用有多大？！
    李：（听他们说的都是有点吹，因此更是不服气）
    噢噢，别骄傲，麻雀也能比老鸦，我们机工所的能力也不差，你们车头能拉车，我们车辆能拉货。没有我所配零件，你们车头也用不得，你们车辆也不能运客货。提起来，我所的工作真复杂，又钻眼，又旋活，洗床，刨床，加零活。各所的零件配得齐，只要你所向我来作揖，我所真是没问题，尽量帮助你。你们不服气，咱们就说一说。
    张：（更不服气）
    喂喂，你们吹的牛皮倒是呱哒哒，千万别把天吹塌，我们装修所的本领大。车头一进厂，大家忙的欢，你修管子我修泵，车轴不动擦油泥，拆风泵是大修理，一天到晚忙不完，火车一天不出厂，车票一天卖不得，旅客天天乱叽叽，影响交通是了不得。火车来了全靠我，没有我，你们全是瞎胡说。
    王：（更着急的说）
    火车没车皮，那算叫拉稀，没我车辆所，你们什么也拉不得。
    赵：（听见他们在吵嚷着急忙上）
    什么事，什么事，你们在乱叽叽。
    张：老赵老赵你来的巧，你给我们评评好不好？我说机厂主要修理火车头，没车头机厂全部不能活。
    王：有车头不算好，没有车皮是瞎叨叨。
    李：别的话不用说，没有零件什么活是作不了。
    赵：（很骄傲的说）
    唉呀呀唉呀呀，我当为的啥，闹半天为的这个来吵架，你们先别说，听听我们电机所，电机所不发电，哪所的工作也是玩不转，我们的礼物可真大如果你们要不服气，咱们大家就比比。
    张王李（互相惊视）
    （唱）这家伙真×蛋，我们叫你来评判，谁叫你来闹意见。
    张：什么话不用说，没有车头铁路不能活，没有电机所，你们都是瞎胡说。
    王：没车皮你们什么也拉不动。
    李：没有零件，你们车坏了修什么。
    （正当他们都自夸时，秘书上）
    秘书：不好了，不好了，咱们车头、车皮全坏了，什么活也作不了。
    张、王（惊奇问）
    怎么车头车皮全坏了，为什么不修理。
    秘书：车头车皮正修呢，没有零件也不成。
    李：没零件怕什么：我们所能造呢。
    秘书：别提啦、别提啦、全厂的电又没啦，这可修理啥！
    赵：没有电那怎么，为什么我所不发电？
    秘书：电是可以发，就是为了模范要争啊，准备三天不发电。
    众：（笑）秘书秘书你真会说笑话。
    秘书：这可不是开玩笑，个人什么也干不了，全厂的事分工一起搞，离开那所工作成不了。要知道，互助才能立功劳。
    秘书：老张的礼物好，车头任务是完成了，车辆才能拉着跑；老王的礼物妙，车辆的任务完成的呱呱叫。
    老李、老赵礼物好，一切零件修好了，电机一动全厂机械才能活。大家互相帮助搞，再大的任务也能完成好。一切困难克服掉，互助起来立功劳。
    众：对！大家互助起来力量大，一切困难我们要克服它。
    张：说着说着忘记了，总结大会开始了，快去送礼物献给模范快当先。
    （大家扭一个过场，英模上）
    秘书：大家说是你当英模，别忘了，别忘了，英雄带领群众干，不骄傲，各方面技术要提高，大家互相虚心来学习，今后的工作搞的好。这些礼物送给你，请你收下大家喜。
    英模：礼物接受了，任务要作好。
    秘书：英雄前面带领干，（众合唱）群众后面加劲赶。
    张：竞赛运动大开展，
    王：工作办法要改善。
    李：提高生产效率，
    赵：技术提高，加强学习。
    秘书：要使工作大发展。
    英模：大家多发明，齐心来改善。
    众：要使大家有福享，增产支前打老蒋。要想当英雄，只有努力干！争取当模范！下次总结会上和大家再见面。（扭过门下场）
