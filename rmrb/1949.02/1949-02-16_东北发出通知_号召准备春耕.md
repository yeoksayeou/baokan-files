Xinhua News Agency, Shenyang, 13th. The Northeast Bureau of the Chinese Communist Party and the Administrative Committee issued a notice on the 4th of this month, calling for preparations for spring plowing, pointing out that the central link in current rural work is the preparation and organization of spring plowing. In areas where the work of building the Communist Party and the people's government has not yet been completed, preparations for spring plowing should be closely integrated with it, and when spring plowing arrives, all efforts should be turned to spring plowing. In newly recovered areas, peasants should be mobilized to engage in production for self-salvation and mutual assistance and cooperation, combined with government loans of grain and loans to solve the difficulties of peasants in spring plowing. All land reform work in new areas that cannot be completed before the start of spring plowing should be ended immediately to fully organize spring plowing. All localities should organize mutual assistance and exchange of labor and animal power based on the principles of voluntariness and mutual benefit. Cadres at all levels should immediately go deep into the countryside to inspect, supervise and solve specific difficulties in spring plowing. The notice emphasized that at present, attention should be paid to overcoming the phenomenon of many cadres letting things take their own course due to the large number of cadres being transferred to the interior.

　　东北发出通知
  　号召准备春耕
    【新华社沈阳十三日电】中共东北中央局与行政委员会本月四日发出通知，号召准备春耕，指出：目前农村工作的中心环节是准备与组织春耕。在建设共产党和建设人民政权等工作尚未结束的地区，应使春耕准备工作与之密切结合进行，春耕到来时，即全力转入春耕。新收复区，应动员农民生产自救互助合作，并结合政府贷粮贷款，以解决农民春耕中的困难。一切新区的土地改革工作，如春耕开始以前不能完成者，应立即结束，以全力组织春耕。各地应根据自愿两利原则组织人力、畜力的互助换工。各级干部应即深入农村，检查督促与解决春耕中的具体困难。通知强调指出，目前要注意克服由于干部将大批被调进关内而产生的许多干部对于工作的放任自流现象。
