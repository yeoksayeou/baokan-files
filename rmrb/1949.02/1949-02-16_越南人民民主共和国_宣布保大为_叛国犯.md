　　Democratic Republic of Vietnam
  　Declares Bảo Đại a "Traitor"
    Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, February 14th: The Vietnamese radio station announced on the 10th that the government of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam has declared former Vietnamese King Bảo Đại a "traitor." Simultaneously with the puppet Vietnamese Prime Minister Nguyễn Văn Xuân preparing in Saigon to welcome Bảo Đại's return to Vietnam to "ascend the throne," the Vietnamese radio station announced that the movement against Bảo Đại has surged in the areas of the People's Republic. In a broadcast entitled "Treason," the Vietnamese radio station declared: "The Vietnamese traitor Bảo Đại has already been sentenced to death by the Democratic Republic of Vietnam, but he, like the Vietnamese traitor (including Nguyễn Văn Xuân), is heading towards death." The imperialists' plot to use Bảo Đại to halt the Vietnamese people's revolutionary movement "will never succeed."

　　越南人民民主共和国
  　宣布保大为“叛国犯”
    【新华社陕北十四日电】越南广播电台十日宣布：越南人民民主共和国政府已宣布越废王保大为“叛国犯”。与伪越南总理阮文春在西贡筹备欢迎保大返越“登极”同时，越南电台宣布：反对保大的运动已在人民共和国的地区高涨起来。越南电台在以“叛国罪”为题的广播中宣称：“越奸保大与业已被越南人民民主共和国宣判死刑，但他越奸（包括阮文春）一样，正在走向死亡”，帝国主义者借保大来停止越南人民革命运的阴谋，“永远也不会成功”。
