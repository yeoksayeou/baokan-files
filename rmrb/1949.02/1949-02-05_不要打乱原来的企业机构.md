　　Do Not Disrupt the Original Enterprise Structure
　　Chen Boda
　　(I)
　　Due to the victory of the People's Liberation War, in areas where the reactionary rule of the Kuomintang has been eliminated, taking over the enterprises of the bureaucrat-capital, headed by the four major families, and other public enterprises (factories, mines, railways, post and telecommunications, ships, banks...etc.), turning the property of the bureaucrat-capital into the property of the people, and enabling these enterprises to continue production well, changing from serving the interests of the feudal comprador forces and bureaucrat-capitalists to serving the interests of the people, is one of the major tasks of our New Democratic Revolution. This task is now becoming increasingly heavy, requiring our comrades to study it better.
　　When we take over such vast bureaucrat-capital enterprises that control the economic lifeline of the country, what methods should we adopt to operate and manage them? This is a very urgent and important new issue placed before us and the Chinese people, and we must resolve it. However, on the one hand, due to the current very urgent military situation, many of our cadres are still busy with military affairs and have no time to attend to other matters; on the other hand, the majority of our cadres still lack experience in operating and managing large industrial and commercial enterprises, and they have not yet learned this kind of work. Based on this situation, and based on the industrial and commercial policies already announced by the Central Committee of the Communist Party and Comrade Mao Zedong, we should adopt the following methods to deal with the bureaucrat-capital enterprises we have taken over at present:
　　First, when we take over bureaucrat-capital enterprises, we should generally not disrupt the original enterprise structure, that is, we should not disrupt its original technical organization and production system, but maintain its integrity.
　　Second, we should encourage workers to do their best to protect, and order all employees serving in the enterprise—engineers, technicians, accountants, supervisors, etc.—to protect all the property (machines, buildings, and all materials), documents, and charts of the enterprise, and not to damage them. Except for a few counter-revolutionaries, saboteurs, and those with obvious bad records, all employees who are willing to continue working should be ordered to continue working and receive their original salaries and wages. If responsible employees have fled during the war or cannot continue to work, their positions can be filled by their original deputies or by selecting appropriate individuals from the original employees. Unless absolutely necessary, the original employees should not be replaced.
　　Third, the People's Liberation Army or the democratic government should send military representatives or political representatives to supervise the operation and management of the enterprise. In particularly large enterprises, it is necessary to establish a supervisory department (or political department), and in addition to dispatching a general representative, dispatch representatives to various work departments and workshops to implement supervision. However, this institution must be extremely simple, and the staffing should be limited to the absolutely necessary extent to avoid increasing the financial burden of the enterprise. The tasks of the supervisory personnel mainly include the following: 1. Supervising and ensuring the progress of production; 2. Preventing reactionary elements from engaging in sabotage and slowing down work; 3. Learning to manage production, studying technical issues and financial issues in the enterprise; 4. Preventing theft, corruption, and eliminating financial waste; 5. Appropriately organizing political education on the people's democratic revolution among employees (this education should be realistic, organized, and enlightening, rather than formalistic, forced, and dogmatic); 6. Assisting employees in organizing trade unions and consumer cooperatives, and discovering and selecting activists and cadres among employees.
　　Fourth, abolish the blood-sucking bureaucracy in the original enterprise. After careful investigation and distinction, expel those parasitic bureaucrats who have no connection with the production cause from the enterprise, and eliminate those who do not engage in production, are not technical, and hold nominal positions in administrative affairs and receive salaries for doing nothing.
　　Fifth, under the supervision of military representatives or political representatives, all employees serving in the enterprise should implement a system of responsibility with defined duties and powers. If things do not go well, the person responsible must be held accountable. If there are criminals, the criminals should be handed over to the court for processing. If supervisory personnel want to make new changes or new plans regarding technical issues and enterprise systems and production organization matters, they should thoroughly research and understand them in advance, consult with relevant personnel, and consult with the workers in mass when necessary, before making a decision. After approval by the higher-level authorities, they can be implemented. They should never rashly and recklessly engage in changes, causing chaos in the enterprise and hindering production.
　　Sixth, at this time when the military situation is tight, it is difficult to rationally revise the wage system on a national scale. As for the wage system in the old liberated areas that was inherited from the supply system, it is also not applicable to large enterprises in big cities. Therefore, in the initial period of taking over bureaucrat-capital enterprises, we should not blindly revise the wage system and wage standards based only on our subjective ideas without proper basis. Instead, we should temporarily implement the original enterprise's wage system and wage standards, and make appropriate calculations according to the changes in various prices and our currency value, so that the actual income of workers and employees is not lower than the actual income before liberation (when calculating wages during the Kuomintang rule, the average actual wage for a short period of approximately three months before liberation should be used as the standard). At the same time, on the basis of this old wage system, in order to improve the enthusiasm of employees for making new progress in production after liberation and to reduce production costs, some temporary measures can be stipulated to give due rewards to those workers, technicians, and various employees who work actively, are good at saving, and take care of public property, and to give due punishment to those who slack off, waste materials, steal, are corrupt, and engage in malpractice. As for rationally revising the wages of all enterprises across the country, we will convene appropriate meetings to handle it when possible. It is wrong to comprehensively revise the original wage system of enterprises at the present time, or to revise the original wage system with the wage system of the old liberated areas. However, in some areas, such as the Northeast, relatively unified wage standards have been initially established, and they should be maintained and improved.
　　Seventh, all kinds of reward systems and insurance systems for employees that have been implemented in various enterprises for many years, such as retirement benefits, pensions, death benefits, wage systems during holidays, and annual salary increases on railways, etc., that have been implemented for many years and are still being implemented, should be implemented as before after we take over, and should not be cancelled. However, certain temporary subsidy measures implemented by the Kuomintang during the war can be changed, and this change must also ensure that the actual income of workers is no less than that during the Kuomintang rule.
　　Eighth, the assessment of employees should be based on the actual work performance in the enterprise.
　　Although these methods are not yet ideal for improving the management of the original bureaucrat-capital enterprises, they are still feasible in the current situation.
　　After we take over bureaucrat-capital enterprises, the treatment and working conditions of employees in the enterprises must and can be improved in the future, but in general, such improvements are still impossible during the current military period. We should explain to the employee masses the reasons why we cannot improve their lives temporarily, but we must fully recognize the original living standards of the employees and their treatment and working conditions that have been implemented for many years, and do everything possible to implement them as before, without lowering the original living standards of the employees, let alone cancelling any conditions that were originally beneficial to the employees in the enterprise. However, if it is impossible to pay all employee salaries, bonuses, and allowances due to temporary financial difficulties, we must explain the reasons to the employees and temporarily partially underpay them, asking for their forgiveness, and wait for financial solutions in the future before making supplementary payments. At the same time, we must also explain to the employees that in the liberated areas, due to the implementation of land reform, people's democracy, and production savings, even during the war, the stability of rising prices can be guaranteed, which is completely different from the situation of soaring prices and inflation in the Kuomintang-controlled areas, so the lives of employees have already been initially guaranteed.
　　It is very clear that our takeover of bureaucrat-capital enterprise institutions must be completely different from our attitude towards the Kuomintang reactionaries' political institutions (that is, the old feudal comprador state apparatus, including the army, government agencies at all levels, military police, secret service agencies, police, prisons, etc.). We must smash the Kuomintang's political institutions and replace them with people's political institutions, and thoroughly destroy all the Kuomintang reactionaries' brutal oppression of the people, from the central government to the Bao-Jia system, and replace them with people's political organizations and political systems. However, our attitude towards bureaucrat-capital enterprise institutions is not one of "smashing." We are against disrupting the original enterprise structure because it is an economic institution, a production institution, not a political institution. (Note: When we smash the Kuomintang reactionaries' political institutions, we do not want to smash the buildings and documents of the old government offices, but to protect and preserve them, just as when we crush the Kuomintang's counter-revolutionary army on the front line, disarm them, and at the same time must protect and preserve the arms and turn them into the people's arms. Except for punishing the principal culprits and saboteurs, we do not exclude all old government employees, but can consider employing them after necessary training. These are not within the scope of this topic and will not be discussed here.)
　　Similarly, it is very clear that our takeover of bureaucrat-capital enterprises is also different from our takeover of the Kuomintang's cultural and educational institutions. We protect all cultural and educational institutions. All ordinary schools, especially schools and courses in the field of natural sciences, should be preserved and continue classes, which is beyond doubt. All faculty and staff who are dedicated to their duties should continue to work as before, which is also beyond doubt. But at the same time, we know that in class society, cultural and educational institutions run by the old ruling class and its agents are subordinate to the goals of that ruling class, making these institutions an appendage of its ruling apparatus. The educational policies and courses of the schools are largely unsuitable for the needs of the people, and some teachers openly defend the old ruling class, spread lies and rumors, and oppose the people. The cultural and educational institutions of the old ruling class, including old schools, newspapers, movies, and dramas, inevitably become tools for the ruling class to spiritually oppress and anesthetize the people. Therefore, after the people become the masters of the ruling class, the old ruling class's cultural and educational organizational system must be greatly and appropriately reorganized to suit the needs of the people. During our takeover period, the first thing to be prohibited is courses such as the Kuomintang's fascist party ideology, and Kuomintang secret agents are prohibited from continuing to serve as teachers. As for our takeover of bureaucrat-capital enterprises, we cannot even talk about reorganizing the technical and production organization there. When we take over bureaucrat-capital enterprises, the first task is to make those enterprises operate effectively immediately and carry out production for the people. To make them operate effectively immediately, we cannot casually disrupt their original structure, and we must allow all the old employees who are dedicated to their duties to continue working.
　　In fact, many of our comrades already understand these principles, have learned the work of taking over enterprises, are good at handling problems in accordance with the central government's policies, and have done a very good job of taking over in the liberated areas, and have made the machines turn quickly. But there are also many comrades who do not yet understand these principles and have not learned to carry out the takeover work in accordance with the central government's policies. When they take over, they unnecessarily send personnel who are not familiar with the business to replace the original personnel (for example, in one place, the heads of the engineering, machinery, and transportation departments of the railway bureau were replaced by three of our amateur comrades, which made people laugh at our comrades); unnecessarily disrupt the original production organization and technical system, and even unnecessarily change the names (for example, some places must change the supervisor to a section chief and the foreman to a team leader, etc.); especially wrong is that some takeover personnel arbitrarily reduce the actual wages of employees and change the reasonable labor reward system and labor insurance system that have existed and been implemented in the enterprise for many years, etc., which affects the mood of workers at work. Because some comrades in some places are not good at carrying out the work of taking over enterprises, they have delayed the recovery of production, and even caused undue losses or damage to the enterprise. We need to urgently correct these improper handling or errors.
　　(II)
　　A certain revolution, overthrowing a certain old production relationship, is marked by the transfer of certain property ownership. The transfer of feudal and semi-feudal land ownership to the land ownership of farmers, and the transfer of the ownership of bureaucrat-capital headed by the four major families to the public ownership of the people, are the two types of property ownership transfer in our current New Democratic Revolution. This transfer of property ownership takes the transfer of political power as its prerequisite. Our comrades, in the capacity of representatives of the people, taking over the enterprises of the bureaucrat-capital, is the transfer of the property of the bureaucrat-capital to the property of the people. This takeover is a revolution that represents a new production relationship replacing the old production relationship. As Comrade Mao Zedong pointed out, the monopoly capital headed by the four major families, combined with the state power, became the comprador feudal state monopoly capitalism, which prepared sufficient material conditions for the New Democratic Revolution. When the enterprises of this comprador feudal state monopoly capitalism fall into the hands of the people and become New Democratic state enterprises, it is also transformed from "the economic foundation of the Jiang Jieshi reactionary regime to the economic foundation of the New Democratic state, and this New Democratic state economy is the state economy of the people under the leadership of the proletariat, and in essence, it is no longer a state economy of a capitalist nature, but a state economy of a socialist nature." Lenin once said: "Socialism is only the next step forward from state capitalist monopoly. Or in other words, socialism is only to turn the state capitalist monopoly to serve the interests of the entire people, so it is no longer a capitalist monopoly." (Lenin on "Impending Catastrophe and How to Combat It"). Therefore, the question here is which class owns the enterprise; whether it is owned by the feudal comprador state represented by the Kuomintang reactionaries, and only represents the interests of the four major families and other feudal comprador bureaucrats; or it is owned by the New Democratic state of the people under the leadership of the proletariat, and represents the interests of the entire people. The transfer of ownership completely changes the nature of the enterprise. After we take over all bureaucrat-capital enterprises, all the people who remain in the original enterprise and are dedicated to their duties are no longer working for the bureaucrat-capitalists, but for the people. Although the original enterprise structure is also operating as before, it is no longer operating for the benefit of the bureaucrat-capitalists, but for the benefit of the entire people. The fundamental nature of the problem lies here. We do not want to disrupt the original enterprise structure that is related to the progress of production, the fundamental reason on the one hand is that when the bureaucrat enterprise is transformed into the people's enterprise, the vast majority of employees, including engineers, technicians, factory directors, and management personnel, will be able to work as before under the same treatment in view of the victory of the people's democratic revolution and the demise of the Kuomintang reactionary rule. And without a doubt, the workers will work enthusiastically. On the other hand, the original technical system and accounting system of this type of large enterprise are organized under certain scientific conditions; from a technical point of view alone, the technical system and accounting system of this type of modern large enterprise are more scientific and more advanced than the temporary things that we originally hastily established in the old liberated areas based on the supply system of the organs and the semi-handicraft method. Therefore, we cannot move the original institutionalized supply system or semi-handicraft or even handicraft production system and casually put it on this type of modern large enterprise.
　　Lenin said this in "State and Revolution":
　　"In the 1870s, a clever German Social-Democrat called the postal service an example of the socialist economic system. This is very true. At the present time the postal service is a business organized on the lines of a state-capitalist monopoly. Imperialism is gradually transforming all trusts into organizations of this type. Standing over the ‘simple’ workers, who are overworked and starved, we see the same bourgeois bureaucracy. But the mechanism of social management is here already to hand. Once we have overthrown the capitalists, crushed the resistance of these exploiters with the iron hand of the armed workers, smashed the bureaucratic machine of the modern state–we shall have a splendidly-equipped mechanism, freed from the ‘parasite,’ a mechanism which can very well be set going by the united workers themselves, hiring their own technicians, foremen, and accountants…."
　　Lenin pointed out: "This is the concrete, practical and immediately feasible task as regards all trusts." Lenin pointed out that we should "organize the whole of national economy on the lines of the postal service," and that all technicians, foremen, accountants and all officials "should be placed under the control and leadership of the armed proletariat." As Comrade Mao Zedong explained, our New Democratic Revolution: "The objects which this new-democratic revolution aims at eliminating are only feudalism and monopoly capitalism, only the landlord class and the bureaucrat-bourgeoisie (the big bourgeoisie), and not capitalism in general, not the petty bourgeoisie and the middle bourgeoisie." Therefore, we are now overthrowing the bureaucrat-capitalists headed by the four major families, not the general capitalists. However, when we overthrow the bureaucrat-capitalists, take over the institutions of the bureaucrat-capital enterprises, and eliminate the bureaucracy there, in fact, as Lenin said: "We shall have a splendidly-equipped mechanism, freed from the ‘parasite’". When we take over this mechanism, what can we do first? That is, to put all the technicians, foremen, accountants, and all officials there under the supervision and leadership of the People's Liberation Army and the New Democratic state power led by the working class, and turn on all the machines, not disrupt it, let alone destroy it. What we are adding there now is mainly to send representatives to supervise and lead the progress of production, and prevent sabotage and slowing down work.
　　To say it again: not disrupt, but supervise. Supervision - this is the work that we must learn immediately and can learn quickly, and it is a relatively easy task.
　　The supervision of state representatives (we are currently supervising with military representatives or political representatives), plus the production enthusiasm and mass supervision of the employee masses in production after they become masters, plus political education on the people's democratic revolution, can enable us to quickly restore the enterprises that were destroyed or damaged by the blood-sucking Kuomintang, the pack of man-eating beasts, and quickly develop the cause of production.
　　However, this does not mean that the bureaucrat-capital enterprises should not be transformed or reformed. No, that's not what it means. Speaking of reform, the abolition of bureaucracy mentioned above is precisely a revolution for our bureaucrat enterprise institutions, and it is precisely the first step of our major reform. Since these types of bureaucrat enterprise institutions were originally tools for the four major families and other warlord bureaucrats to suck blood, these institutions had a huge bureaucratic system that ruthlessly plundered the workers and prevented the development of productive forces. Therefore, if we do not abolish this blood-sucking bureaucracy, we cannot promote the advancement of productive forces. In addition, many of the entire enterprise organization are also unreasonable, which is not conducive to promoting the enthusiasm of employees and developing production, and reform is also completely necessary. But we know that to reform it, we must first understand it, be familiar with it, and be proficient in it, and then we can replace the unreasonable system with a reasonable system and replace the lower technical organization with the higher technical organization based on certain possible conditions. If we have not yet touched these aspects, have not yet become familiar with them, and have not yet mastered higher technology and more reasonable systems, we will deny and destroy the original organization and system, which will inevitably cause chaos. As long as we are still blind to the cause, our reform will be impossible to start; if we move around randomly, it will be detrimental and not beneficial. Therefore, our reform can only be gradual and can never be acute.
　　Marx said: Revolution is the locomotive of history. Here, we can say this: Revolution is the locomotive of the development of social productive forces. We have learned the skills and can carry out such a large-scale people's revolution. There is no doubt that we will also learn the skills and increase our productive forces at an unprecedented speed in history on the basis of our revolution. At that time, we will have incomparably higher technology and enterprise organization than in today's enterprises. But when we have not yet reached this point, we can only start to move forward from the existing technology and the existing enterprise organization.
　　(III)
　　After the Japanese devils surrendered, the blood-sucking bureaucrats of the Kuomintang robbed the fruits of the people's victory. During their takeover, they divided and destroyed the colonial enterprise institutions that Japanese imperialism had built up with the flesh and blood of the Chinese people as much as possible, causing us huge losses when we took over all these enterprises today. When we take over these many enterprises that have been disrupted by the blood-sucking bureaucrats of the Kuomintang and have been largely destroyed by them, in order to enable them to quickly restore production for the people, we must handle them carefully and not disrupt them further on the basis of the disruption already made by the Kuomintang.
　　The Kuomintang bureaucrats split and looted the colonial enterprises of Japanese imperialism in order to embezzle and make a fortune. Some of our comrades disrupted some of the original enterprise institutions during the takeover, not to embezzle and make a fortune, and they often started from good revolutionary intentions. They did not do well, only because they were not familiar with them, not because of anything else. Once these comrades understand these principles, they will be able to do a very good job, which has been proven.
　　However, we must admit that some of our comrades often made mistakes in handling the original enterprise system or personnel issues rashly and recklessly when they were not familiar with them. What is reflected here is not the proletarian point of view, but only the petty bourgeois point of view, the small producer's point of view, and the craftsman's point of view. This petty bourgeois point of view is full of laxity and one-sidedness. When handling things, they are self-righteous and arbitrarily make decisions, instead of investigating and studying, instead of learning modestly, and instead of guiding the people's cause in accordance with certain historical laws. In particular, they are not good at mobilizing, organizing, and relying on the enthusiasm and wisdom of the employees in the enterprise who are loyal to the revolution to promote and guarantee the advancement of the people's cause. This is precisely the subjectivism that Comrade Mao Zedong has often severely criticized. This petty bourgeois point of view, in terms of organization, is also manifested as a state of anarchy and indiscipline, without asking for instructions in advance and without reporting afterwards. The harm of this state of anarchy and indiscipline to the revolutionary cause has long been repeatedly pointed out by the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China.
　　It is very clear that on economic work, we must continue to severely oppose subjectivism in thought, and we must continue to severely oppose the state of anarchy and indiscipline in organization, and require all comrades working on the economic front to execute the central government's policies 100% unconditionally.

　　不要打乱原来的企业机构
    陈伯达
    （一）
    由于人民解放战争的胜利，在国民党反动统治被消灭了的地区，接管以四大家族为首的官僚资本的企业及其他公共企业（工厂、矿山、铁路、邮电、轮船、银行……等等），把官僚资本的财产变而为人民的财产，并使这些企业很好地继续进行生产，由为封建买办势力、官僚资本家的利益服务变而为人民的利益服务，乃是我们新民主主义革命的重大任务之一。这个任务，现已日益繁重起来，需要我们同志更好地加以学习。
    当着我们接管了如此庞大的、掌握国家经济命脉的官僚资本企业，我们应该采用怎样的办法去经营和管理呢？这乃是提在我们和中国人民面前一个非常迫切而重大的新的问题，我们必须加以解决。但是，一方面，由于目前军事情况非常紧急，我们的许多干部还在忙于军事，无暇顾及其他；另一方面，我们的多数干部对于经营和管理大的工商业又还缺乏经验，他们还没有学会这种工作。根据这种情形，并根据共产党中央及毛泽东同志所已宣布的工商业政策，我们对于所接管的官僚资本企业，在目前应该采取下列各项办法来处理：
    第一、当着我们去接管官僚资本企业时，一般地不要打乱原来的企业机构，就是说，不要打乱它原来的技术组织与生产系统，而要保持其完整。
    第二、应该鼓励工人尽力保护、并责令原来在企业中服务的一切职员——工程师、技师、会计、监工等保护企业所有的财产（机器、房屋及一切资材）、文书、图表，不得有所损坏。除开少数反革命分子、破坏分子及劣迹昭著者外，凡愿意照旧供职的一切员工，应令他们照旧供职，支取原来的薪水和工资。如有在战争中逃亡、及不能照旧供职的负责职员，其职位可由原来的副手顶替，或者从原来职工中挑选适当者充当。如没有十分必要，不应撤换原来的职工。
    第三、由人民解放军或民主政府派出军事代表或政治代表，对于企业的经营和管理，实施监督。在特别巨大的企业中，必要时设立监督部（或政治部），除派遣总代表外并分派代表到各工作部门和车间实施监督。但此项机构必须极其简单，人员的配备只限在绝对必要的限度之内，以免加重企业中财政的负担。监督人员的任务，主要为下列各事：一、监督并保障生产的进行；二、防止反动分子进行破坏及怠工；三、学习管理生产，研究企业中的技术问题与财政问题；四、防止偷窃、贪污并消灭财政的浪费；五、在职工中适当地组织关于人民民主革命的政治教育（这种教育应该是实事求是的、有条有理的、启发式的，而不是形式主义的、勉强的、硬灌式的）；六、协助职工组织工会及消费合作社，发现并挑选职工中的积极分子和干部。
    第四、废除原来企业中吸血的官僚制。在调查研究仔细分别之后，把那些和生产事业没有联系的寄生官僚逐出企业，淘汰那些不事生产的、非技术的、在事务上挂名而领干薪的闲杂人员。
    第五、在军事代表或政治代表监督之下，所有在企业中供职的职员，实行有职有权的责任制，事情如进行不好，须向负责任者追究责任，如有犯罪者，则把犯罪分子交给法庭处理。监督人员关于技术问题以及关于企业制度及生产组织事宜，如要有新的改变，新的计划，应事先切实研究清楚，并和有关人员商量，并在必要时先和工人群众商量，而后作出决定，经过上级机关批准后，才得执行，决不应草率地鲁莽地从事改变，引起企业中的紊乱，妨害生产。
    第六、在目前军事正紧的时候，如要即在全国范围内合理地改订工资制度，那是困难的。至于老解放区原来那种因袭供给制度而来的工资制度，也不适用于大城市的大企业。因此，在接管官僚资本企业的最初一个时期内，不应该只凭自己主观的想法，没有妥当的根据，即忙乱的改订工资制度与工资标准，而应该暂且实行原来企业的工资制度和工资标准，按照各项物价变动的情况与我们的币值，加以适当的计算，使工人和职员的实际所得，不低于在解放前的实际所得（在计算国民党统治时期的工资时，则应以解放前一个短时期大约三个月的平均的实际工资为标准）。同时，在这种旧工资的基础上，为着提高职工们在解放后新的追求进步的生产积极性和减低生产成本，可规定若干临时办法，对于那些积极工作、善于节约、爱护公物的工人、技师和各种职员，给以应有的奖励，而对于那些怠工、浪费物资、偷盗、贪污、舞弊的人则给以应有的处罚。至于合理地改订全国各企业的工资，则待有可能时，我们当召集适当的会议来加以处理。在目前企业全面改订原来的工资制，或以老解放区的工资制去改订原来的工资制，都是错误的。但在某些地区，例如在东北，已经初步订立了比较统一的工资标准，则应保持并加以改进。
    第七、所有各企业业已实行多年的对职工的各种奖励制度、保险制度，例如企业中的退职金、养老金、抚恤金、假期照给工资制度及铁路上的年终加薪等，凡过去已实行多年，现在仍在实行者，我们接管后，当一律照旧实行，不得取消。但国民党在战争时期所实行的某些临时补贴办法，则可加以改变，这种改变亦必须使工人所实得者不少于国民党统治时期。
    第八、对于职工的考察，以在企业中的实际工作好坏为标准。
    以上这些办法，虽然还不能合于理想地改善原来官僚资本企业的管理，但在目前情形下还是可以行得通的办法。
    我们在接管官僚资本企业后，对于企业中的职工的待遇及劳动条件，将来是必须也可能加以改善的，但在目前军事时期，这种改善，一般还是不可能的。我们应向职工群众说明暂时不能改善职工生活的理由，但职工原有的生活水平及其业已实行多年的待遇与劳动条件，我们必须全部承认，尽一切可能照旧实行，而不应降低职工原来的生活水淮，更不应取消企业中原来对职工有利的任何条件。但是如因一时财政困难，不能全部发给职工工资及奖金恤金时，则须向职工说明理由，暂时地部分地欠发，请求职工原谅，以待将来财政有办法时再行补发。同时，又须向职工说明，在解放区由于实行土地改革，人民民主和生产节约，虽在战争期中，仍能保证物价上升的平稳，较之国民党统治区物价飞腾、通货膨胀的情况，完全是两个世界，故职工生活实已有了初步保障。
    很明白：我们接管官僚资本的企业机构，必须和我们对于国民党反动派的政治机构（即旧的封建的买办的国家机器，包括军队、各级政府机关、宪兵、特务机关、警察、监狱等等）的态度完全区别出来。我们要打碎国民党的政治机构，而代以人民的政治机构，要彻底破坏国民党反动派一切残暴压迫人民的、从中央到保甲的政治组织与政治制度，而代以人民的政治组织与政治制度。但是，我们对于官僚资本的企业机构就不是什么“打碎”的态度。我们反对打乱原来的企业机构，问题就是因为它是经济机构，是生产机构，而不是政治机构。（按：我们打碎国民党反动派的政治机构，但对于旧衙门的房屋和文卷之类也不是要打碎，而是要保护和保存下来，这好象在前线粉碎国民党的反革命军队，解除他们的武装，同时又必须把武装保护与保存起来，转而成为人民的武装一样。除了惩办首恶分子破坏分子以外，对于旧的政府公务员，我们也不是一律排斥，而是在经过必要的训练后，可以酌量任用的。这些不在本题之内，这里不用多说。）
    同样地很明白：我们接管官僚资本的企业，和我们接管国民党的文化教育机关也有一定的区别。我们保护一切文化教育机关。一切普通学校特别是属于自然科学范围的学校和课程，应该保存下来，继续上课，那更是毫无疑问的。一切尽忠教务的教职员应该照旧供职，那也是毫无疑问的。但同时我们知道：在阶级社会中，旧的统治阶级及其代理人所主持的文化教育机关，乃是服从于该统治阶级的目的，使该项机关成为其统治机构的附属部分，其中学校的教育方针与课程，很多是不适合人民需要的，有的教员公开为旧的统治阶级辩护，撒谎造谣，而反对人民。旧统治阶级的文化教育机关，包括旧的学校、报纸、电影、戏剧等，都不可避免地成为该统治阶级在精神上压迫与麻醉人民的工具。因此，在人民成为统治的主人之后，对于旧统治阶级的文化教育组织制度，必须加以很大的适当的改组，使之适合于人民的需要，而在我们接管时期，首先要禁止的就是国民党的法西斯党义之类的课程，并禁止国民党特务分子继续担任教职。至于我们接管官僚资本的企业，首先就还谈不上改组那里的技术与生产组织之类的问题。我们在接管官僚企业时，首先的任务是要使那些企业马上有效地动作起来，为人民进行生产，而要它马上有效地动作起来，就不能够随便打乱它原来的机构，并且完全必须让一切尽忠职守的旧的职工继续工作。
    事实上，我们已有很多同志了解这些道理，学会了接管企业的工作，善于按照中央的政策处理问题，而在解放的地方把接管工作做得很好，并使机器很快地转动起来。可是我们也还有不少同志还没有了解这些道理，还没有学会按照中央的政策来进行接管的工作，他们在接管时，没有必要地派遣不熟悉该项事业的人员去代替原来的人员（例如有一个地方铁路局的工务、机务、运务三处处长被我们三个外行的同志所代替，结果使人家看我们同志的笑话）；没有必要地打乱原来的生产组织和技术制度，甚至是完全多余地去改变名称（例如有的地方一定要把监工改叫股长，把工头改叫组长等）；尤其错误的，就是：有的接管人员擅自降低职工的实际工资，改变在企业中多年存在一直实行的合理的劳动奖励制度与劳动保险制度等等，因而影响了工人工作的情绪。由于有的同志，有的地方，不善于进行接管企业的工作，也就延迟了生产的恢复，甚至使该项企业受了不应有的损失或破坏。我们需要急于改正这一类不妥当的处理或错误。

    一定的革命，推翻一定的旧的生产关系，其标志就是一定的财产所有权的转移。封建的与半封建的土地所有权转变为农民的土地所有权，以四大家族为首的官僚资本的所有权转变为人民公共的所有权，这就是现在我们新民主主义革命中两种财产所有权的转移。这种财产所有权的转移，是以政权的转移为其前提的。我们同志以人民的代表的资格去接管官僚资本的企业，这就是官僚资本的财产转移为人民的财产。这个接管，就是表现一种新的生产关系代替了旧的生产关系的革命。按照毛泽东同志所指出的，以四大家族为首的垄断资本，与国家政权结合在一起，成为买办的封建的国家垄断资本主义，它替新民主主义革命准备了充分的物质条件。当这个买办的封建的国家垄断资本主义的企业入于人民之手而变成新民主主义的国家企业的时候，它也就是由“蒋介石反动政权的经济基础，变成新民主主义国家的经济基础，而这种新民主主义的国家经济，乃是在无产阶级领导下的人民大众的国家经济，按其实质说来，已不是资本主义性质的国家经济，而是具有社会主义性质的国家经济了。列宁曾经说过：“……………社会主义不过是由国家资本主义垄断制前进的最近一步而已。或者换句话说：社会主义不过是把国家资本主义垄断制转过来服务于全体人民的利益，于是也就不复是资本主义的垄断了。”（列宁论“灾祸临头和防止之法”）。所以，这里的问题是企业归那个阶级所有；或者是归国民党反动派所代表的封建买办的国家所有，而只代表四大家族及其他封建买办官僚的利益；或者是归无产阶级领导下的人民大众的新民主主义的国家所有，而代表全体人民的利益。所有权的转移，即完全改变了该项企业的性质。一切官僚资本企业在我们接管之后，一切在原企业中照旧尽忠职守的人们，他们已不是为官僚资本家而工作，而是为人民而工作了。原来企业机构虽然也是照旧动作起来，但那已不是为官僚资本家的利益而动作，而是为全体人民的利益而动作了。问题的根本性质就在这里。我们不要打乱那和生产的进行相联系的原来的企业机构，根本的理由，一方面就是当官僚企业转变为人民的企业的时候，其中绝大多数的职员，包括工程师、技师、厂长及管理人员在内，将鉴于人民民主革命的胜利与国民党反动统治的覆灭，是能够在同等待遇之下照旧工作的。而毫无疑义，工人们则将热情地工作。另方面，这类大企业原来的技术系统与计算制度，是在一定的科学条件之下组织起来的；单从技术方面来看，这类新式大企业的技术系统与计算制度，较之我们原来在老解放区因袭机关上的供给制度及半手工业方式所草率建立起来的临时性质的东西，是要更合于科学一些，更进步一些，因此，我们就不能够把原来那种机关化的供给制度或半手工业以至于是手工业的生产制度搬来，随便套上这类新式的大企业。
    列宁在“国家与革命”一书中这样说过：
    “十九世纪七十年代，有一个聪明的德国社会民主党人曾称邮局为社会主义经济底模型。这是很对的。现在的邮局是按国家资本主义垄断的方式组织起来的一种经济。帝国主义正在逐渐地把所有的托拉斯变为同一形式的组织。在那些工作过重而还挨着饥荒的‘普通’工人们之上，这里存在着同样的资产阶级的官僚制。但是社会的管理的机构，这里已经预备好了。我们只须去打倒资本家，用武装工人的铁手去压服这些剥削者的反抗，去打破现代国家的官僚机关；——我们就有一个没有‘寄生虫’而是高度技术设施的机构，这个机构可以由团结着的工人们亲自来运用，同时雇用技师、监工、会计员…………”。
    列宁指出：“这是关于所有托拉斯的一个具体的、实际的、而且立即可以实现的任务”。列宁指出要“依照邮局的制度去组织我们的全部国民经济”，而使所有的技师、监工、会计员及一切官员“要在武装的无产阶级监督和领导之下”。我们的新民主主义革命，如毛泽东同志所说明：“新民主主义革命所要消灭的对象，只是封建主义与垄断资本主义，只是地主阶级与官僚资产阶级（大资产阶级）。而不是一般地消灭资本主义，不是消灭小资产阶级与中等资产阶级”。因此，现在我们这里是打倒以四大家族为首的官僚资本家，并不是打倒一般资本家。但是，当我们打倒了官僚资本家，接管了官僚企业的机构，消灭了那里的官僚制，实际上，也就如列宁所说的：“我们就有一个没有寄生虫而是高度技术设施的机构”。当我们接管了这个机构，我们首先能够做出的是什么呢？这就是：要使那里所有的技师、监工、会计员以及一切官员放在以工人阶级为领导的人民解放军和新民主主义的国家政权的监督和领导之下，把所有的机器都转动起来，而不是打乱它，更不是破坏它。在那里，我们现在所加上的，主要是派代表加以监督，领导生产的进行，防止怠工和破坏。
    再说一句：不是打乱，而是监督。监督——这就是我们所必须马上学习而且能够很快学会的工作，是比较地轻而易举的工作。
    国家代表的监督（我们目前是以军事代表或政治代表监督），加上生产中的职工群众成为主人之后的生产积极性与群众的监督，加上关于人民民主革命的政治教育，这样，就能够使我们迅速地恢复国民党那些吸血者、那批吃人的野兽所破坏或损坏的企业，迅速地发展生产的事业。
    但是，这并不是说，对于官僚资本企业不要改造，不要改革。不，不是这样说的。要说改革的话，上面所说的废除官僚制，正是我们对于官僚企业机构的一种革命，正是我们进行的第一步的重大的改革。这类官僚企业机构，原来既然是四大家族及其他军阀官僚吸血的工具，这类机构存在了很庞大的官僚系统而无情地掠夺了工人，阻止了生产力的发展，因此，不废除这种吸血的官僚制，我们就不能够推动生产力的前进。除此而外，全部企业组织，也还有很多是不合理的，对于发扬职工的积极性及发展生产是不利的，改革也是完全需要的。但是我们知道：要改革它，就必须首先了解它，熟悉它，精通它，而后才能根据一定可能的条件，用合理的制度去代替不合理的制度，用更高的技术组织去代替较低的技术组织。如果我们在这些方面，还没有接触，还没有熟悉，还没有掌握更高的技术与更合理的制度，就去否定和破坏原有的组织和制度，那就必然要引起混乱。只要我们对该项事业还是盲目的时候，我们的改革就无从着手；如果乱动一顿，就将是有损无益。因此，我们的改革，只能是逐步的，决不能是急性的。
    马克思说：革命是历史的火车头。在这里，我们可以这样说：革命是社会生产力发展的火车头。我们已经学会了本事，能够进行这样伟大规模的人民革命，毫无疑问：我们也将学会本事，在我们革命的基础上，以历史上空前的速度来提高我们的生产力。那时我们就将有比现在企业中更高得不可比拟的技术与企业组织。但是当我们还没有达到这点的时候，我们只得从现有技术、现有企业组织的基础上来开始前进。
　　（三）
    国民党的吸血官僚们在日寇投降后抢劫人民胜利的果实，在其接收时，把日本帝国主义用中国人民血肉堆叠起来的殖民地企业机构，加以四分五裂，尽量破坏，使我们今天接管这一切企业的时候，受了浩大的损失。当我们接管这许多业已被国民党吸血官僚们打乱了、并且业已被他们大量破坏了的企业，为着使它们能够迅速为人民而恢复生产，就必须谨慎处理，而不要在国民党已打乱的基础上再加以打乱。
    国民党官僚们分裂与洗劫日本帝国主义的殖民地企业，是为了贪污发财。我们有些同志在接管时候，打乱一些原来的企业机构，不是为了贪污发财，而且时常是从革命的好心出发，他们没有做好，仅仅是因为不熟悉，而不是因为别的。我们这些同志只要一旦了解了这类道理的时候，也就能够把工作做得非常之好，这是已被证明了的。
    但是，我们必须承认：我们一些同志在不熟悉的情况之下，对于原来的企业制度或人事问题常常犯了草率鲁莽处理的错误，这里所反映的，并不是无产阶级的观点，而只是反映了小资产阶级的观点，小生产者的观点，手工业者的观点。这种小资产阶级的观点，充满了散漫性和一孔之见，处理事情起来，自以为是，任意作主，而不是调查研究，不是虚心学习，不是按照一定历史的规律去引导人民的事业，特别是不善于发动、组织和倚靠企业中忠于革命的职工群众的热情和智慧，来推动与保障人民事业的前进。这正是毛泽东同志经常严厉批评的主观主义。这种小资产阶级的观点，在组织上，也就表现为无政府无纪律状态，事先不请示，事后不报告。这种无政府无纪律状态的有害于革命事业，是早由中共中央所屡次指出来了的。
    很明白：关于经济工作，我们在思想上必须继续严厉地反对主观主义，在组织上必须继续严厉地反对无政府无纪律状态，而要求所有在经济战线上工作的同志们百分之百地、无条件地执行中央的政策。
