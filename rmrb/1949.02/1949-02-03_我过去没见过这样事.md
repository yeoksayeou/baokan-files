　　I've Never Seen Anything Like This Before
　　Wang Shouwen, Worker in Yangquan
　　Since liberation, I returned to work at the factory and have often witnessed amazing deeds by the workers, which reminds me of the past. In the old days, when the enemy was around, the ash removers, regardless of whether they cleaned well or not, whether it was usable or not, just fooled around. They would go in and poke around a few times and call it done. If a spot was hard to reach, they wouldn't even bother trying before coming back up. Now, it's completely different. Everyone is removing ash with great enthusiasm and thoroughly cleaning everything. Each person removes at least two or three baskets, some even five baskets. Especially the squad leaders, they always remove a few extra scoops. If a spot is hard to reach, the squad leader will go and clean it. After they're done, they'll meticulously inspect it one more time, so that each cleaning of the flue is as effective as possible. When others go down to remove ash, the squad leaders let them come back up after only two or three baskets, and then go down themselves to remove ash. What's the reason for this? It's because everyone clearly recognizes that they are working for themselves, and they clearly understand that the factory is our own. In the past, I never saw such a phenomenon. Now, they're actually doing things I never thought possible. The recent rush to fix the air pocket, the rush to repair the air pocket, the rush to repair the blast furnace and water channels after the bombing – this kind of work enthusiasm was never seen in the past. All I saw was that when the enemy was here, some people would inquire about the furnace's condition at the South Gate every day before going to work. If the furnace was in good condition, they'd come to work; if the furnace had a problem, they'd turn around and go home. This is because today's workers, under the leadership of the Communist Party, have raised their awareness. They know that the state-owned factory is their own big family and the property of the people.

　　我过去没见过这样事
    阳泉工人王守文
    自从解放以后，我就回厂工作，常常看到工人们作出来的惊人事迹，就回想起过去。从前敌人在的时候，每次掏灰时，掏灰的人不管掏的干净不干净，能用不能用，反正混鬼，进去掏几下就算完，在不好掏的地方，连掏都不掏，就上来了。现在和以前就大不同了，大家都掏的很起劲，很干净，每人至少掏两三簸箕，有的甚至掏五簸箕，特别是当班长的，一定要多掏几下，不好掏的地方班长去掏，完了他又圪里圪外的检查一次，使烟道掏一次顶一次事，当别人下去掏的时候，不等掏上两三簸箕就让上来，班长们自己去掏，这是什么原因呢？是因为大家都认识清楚这是为自己干，认识清楚工厂是我们自己的。过去我是没有看到这样的现象，现在居然做出我想不到的事来。最近的红打风包，抢修风包，飞机轰炸后抢修大炉、抢修水道，这种工作热情表现，在过去是没有看到的，看到的只是敌人在时有些人每天上工时，在南门上打听炉子的情况，炉子要好就来上工，炉子出了毛病就扭头回家。这就是今天的工人在共产党的领导下，认识提高了。知道国营工厂是自己的大家庭，是人民的财产。
