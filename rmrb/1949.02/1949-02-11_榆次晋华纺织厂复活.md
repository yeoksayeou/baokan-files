　　The Revival of Yuci Jinhua Textile Factory
    The Yuci Jinhua Textile Factory was founded in the tenth year of the Republic of China and is the largest textile factory in Shanxi Province. The factory covers an area of ​​more than 250 acres, with 2,460 rooms. Before the Incident, there were 41,200 yarn spindles, producing 54,000 pounds of yarn per day (24 hours). In addition to supplying small and medium-sized cotton textile factories in the interior of Shanxi, most of the yarn was sold to Zhengzhou, Shijiazhuang, Gaoyang and other places. There were 480 looms, producing more than 1,000 bolts of cloth per day (24 hours), which were sold throughout North China. The factory buildings were magnificent, and the number of workers once increased to more than 5,000. It required 63,000 pounds of cotton per day.

    At the beginning of the Jinzhong Campaign, the Yan bandit planned to weaken and destroy the factory. First, they deceived and incited the workers to flee, then forced the workers to dismantle the 1,150-kilogram generator, and then successively moved away 70 electric motors and 17,000 spindles. When we liberated it, machine parts were lying horizontally and vertically all over the station, factory roads, and machine rooms. The factory was filled with chaos and desolation. Only one person in charge of the warehouse remained among the dozens of employees. The deceived workers huddled in the dormitory in panic. Our receiving cadres personally went to the workers' area to publicize and explain our party's policies, comforted some extremely poor workers, and distributed temporary rations to eight worker families. The workers saw our practical actions, which were the opposite of the Yan bandit's propaganda, so in less than three days, most of the workers and employees signed up. Immediately, the employees were mobilized to check the equipment and clean up all the machine parts on the station and factory roads, and a preliminary arrangement was quickly made.

    Due to the Yan bandit's economic bankruptcy and the cruel exploitation of the workers, the workers were extremely poor and generally ate bean cakes and coarse bran. Worker Liu Zhanlian couldn't even afford bean cakes. Luo Yuanzhong's children begged for food on the street every day. The workers urgently demanded work and food, but the machines were damaged! After we took over, we first carried out general relief based on preliminary understanding, using 8,313 catties of grain to distribute to 320 households. Secondly, according to the workers' labor force and the living conditions of their families, we organized and arranged them separately. We consulted with the local government and obtained 12,000 sets of military uniforms for the female workers to dismantle and wash. Each set of wages was 11 taels of rice, totaling 8,200 catties of rice, which solved the difficulties of 175 households. Some male workers were organized to do small business in the local market, and 305,000 yuan of Jicha were used to support them. Ten people were introduced to work in the railway bureau, and seven were introduced to sew socks. Third, in the case of not being able to start major construction, small production was organized to preserve the workers and dispel their concerns. In the factory, 80 hand-operated looms were started first, and then four small engine machines were actively borrowed from Taigu and Jingxing to start 1,600 spindles in order to transition to major construction.

    Next, education was carried out among the workers to raise their awareness. The workers in this factory have always been under the rule of dark forces, coupled with the Yan bandit's bloody rule, which made the workers' contact with the outside world, especially their understanding of our party, extremely vague. Therefore, raising the workers' political awareness became an important key to the work. At that time, three people who had helped the bandits do evil during the Yan bandit period were exposed and isolated, and the ideological boundaries among the employees were clearly drawn. A study committee was organized among the staff to collectively study and discuss our party's industrial and commercial policies and employee policies in groups. Night schools were organized among the workers to explain the nature of factories in new democratic countries, distinguish between the enemy and ourselves, and establish new labor attitudes. In order to enable employees to understand our policies more quickly, the leadership also adopted methods of self-criticism and consulting with workers more often. Worker Wang Qiuke said: "Since liberation, my heart has become more and more open day by day. In the future, I must work hard and catch up with the brothers in the old liberated areas." After education, the workers' understanding was greatly improved, and the spirits of some middle and lower-level employees were also refreshed.

    Subsequently, the Employee Preparatory Committee was established. During the preparation time, a deeper understanding of the workers was carried out, and at the workers' request, literacy classes were organized and a library was established, and 300 new books were purchased from bookstores. After the establishment of the workers' organization, the workers' enthusiasm for learning greatly increased. According to statistics from October to December for sixty days, 48 people borrowed books to read. At first, most of the books borrowed were about land reform, and later, most of the books borrowed were about industry and commerce. Some with low cultural levels actively learn culture; some with reading ability read literary works and revolutionary stories. As of the end of December, 30% of male and female workers had participated in literacy classes. Wang Yunsheng, a male worker in his forties, also wanted to go to the Shijiazhuang Staff and Workers School to study. After the factory printed the "Worker Literacy Textbook", 112 people went to buy it on January 8 alone. Worker Chen Qi said: "I have been working for more than 20 years, and I have never had such good leadership as today. In the future, I will think about how to study and improve our production!" Liu Shunqi told reporters: "In the past (referring to before liberation), there was also the name of a trade union, which was a 'secret trade union' that worked for the officials. Now it is really planning for us workers." A worker's family member who returned from working in Taiyuan had a very hard life, and the trade union helped him with 80 catties of barley. When two workers fell ill, the trade union hired a doctor for them. At the New Year's Day workers' representative meeting, everyone actively and frankly put forward opinions on improving production.

    At the time of liberation, there were only 150 textile workers, which increased to 446 by January 9, and with great enthusiasm, the large engine destroyed by the Yan bandit was repaired. In mid-December and early January, the factory recruited 210 trainees and new workers. The operation of the machines and the output are increasing day by day. The first employee representative conference was held on New Year's Day, and the employee union was officially established, and the workers' production enthusiasm was even higher. The daily report on January 3 showed 3,456 spindles running, producing 1,568 pounds of yarn. The daily report on January 8 showed 11,641 spindles running (all based on two shifts for 24 hours), producing 5,548 pounds of yarn. Under the Yan bandit's rule, each spindle could only produce 1.3 pounds per day with electricity. Now, with steam power, it can produce 1.35 to 1.4 pounds per day. The workers said: "Now we just hope to take down Taiyuan and get back our machines, so that all the machines can start working."

　　榆次晋华纺织厂复活
    榆次晋华纺织厂创始于民国十年，是山西全省规模最大的纺织厂。厂址占地二百五十多亩，盖房二千四百六十间。事变前共有纱机锭子四万一千二百个，每日（二十四小时）能出纱五万四千磅，纱线细而匀。除供山西内地中小棉织厂使用外，大部行销郑州、石庄、高阳等地。有织布机四百八十台，每日（二十四小时）能出一千多匹布，遍销华北各地。工厂建筑宏伟，工人一度增加到五千多人。每日须用棉花六万三千磅。
    晋中战役一开始，阎匪就筹划了对工厂的削弱和破坏，先欺骗煽动工人随之逃走，又强制工人拆走了一千一百五十启罗的大发电机，后又陆续搬走了七十来部电动机和一万七千个纱锭。到我解放时，车站上，厂道上和机房间遍地横躺竖卧的机件。工厂充满了混乱、荒凉。几十个职员中只剩有管仓库的一人。受欺骗的工人，恐慌的缩在宿舍里。我接收干部亲自到工人区进行我党政策的宣传解释，对一些极为困苦的工人，给以安慰，又发给八户工人的临时口粮。工人见到了我们的实际行动，与阎匪的宣传正相反，所以不到三天，大部工人和职员即签名报到。当即发动员工检查用具，收拾车站、厂道上的一切机件，迅速得到初步安置。
    由于阎匪经济上的破产和残酷的敲榨工人，造成了工人极度的贫困，普遍的吃豆饼，粗糠。工人刘占连豆饼也吃不上了。罗元中的小孩天天到街上讨食。工人们迫切要求工作吃饭，而机器却被损坏了！我们接收以后，首先根据初步了解，举行了一般的救济，计用粮食八千三百十三斤发给了三百二十户。其次，根据工人的劳动力和家属生活情况，分别进行了组织和安置，与当地政府商洽，弄来一万二千套军装，给女工拆洗。每套工资米十一两，共可得米八千二百斤，解决了一百七十五户的困难，组织一些男工临时到当地集市上作小买卖，并用了三十万五千元的冀钞，予以扶助。又介绍了十个人到铁路局工作，介绍了七个人去缝袜子。第三、在不能大动工的情况下，又组织小生产，以保存工人并解除其顾虑。在厂内，先开动了八十台人力织布机，后又积极从太谷、井陉借来了四部小引擎机，开动了一千六百个锭子，以便过渡到大动工。
    接着，分别在工人中进行教育，提高他们的觉悟。该厂工人历来都处于黑暗势力的统治下，加之阎匪血腥的统治，使工人们对外界的接触，特别是对我党的认识极其模糊。因此，提高工人政治觉悟，就成了工作的重要关键。当时对三个在阎匪时期曾助匪作恶的分子，进行了揭露和孤立，划清了职工中的思想界限。又在职员中组织了学委会，以小组为单位集体研究讨论我党工商业政策和职工政策。在工人中组织了夜校，讲解新民主主义国家工厂的性质，并分清敌我界线以及树立新的劳动态度等。为了使职工更快的了解我们的政策，领导上又采取了自我检讨和多与工人商量的办法。工人王秋科说：“自从解放后，我心里一天比一天开通，今后我一定要好好干，赶上老解放区的兄弟。”经过教育，工人的认识大为提高，一些中下级职员精神也痛快了。
    随后即成立职工筹委会。在筹备时间，对工人进行了更深入的了解，并在工人的要求下，组织了识字班，建立了图书馆，从书店购来新书三百本。在建立了工人的组织后，工人学习情绪大为提高。据十月至十二月六十天统计，有四十八人借了书看。先是借有关土改者多，后是借有关工商业书者多。一些文化低的积极学文化；一些有阅读能力的阅读文艺作品和革命故事。截至十二月底止，有百分之卅的男女工参加了识字班。四十多岁的男工王运声，也要争着到石庄职工学校去学习。在厂方印出了“工人识字课本”后，只一月八日一天，即有一百十二人去买。工人陈琪说：“我干了二十来年，再没今天领导的好，今后就是想法怎么学习，把咱的生产闹好！”刘顺启告记者说：“过去（指解放前）也曾有过工会的名字，那是‘里工会’，给官家办事的。现在可真是为咱工人打算。”一个从太原工作回来的工属，生活很苦，工会扶助了他八十斤大麦。有两个工人闹病，工会就给他们请医生。在元旦工人代表会上，大家积极坦率的提出了对改进生产的意见。
    刚解放时，纺织工人只有一百五十个，到一月九日止，增到四百四十六个，并以高度热情修好被阎匪破坏了的大引擎。厂方于十二月中旬和一月初招收了二百一十名养成工和新工人。机器的开动和产量都在日益增加。元旦举行第一次职工代表大会，正式成立了职工会，工人的生产热情更加提高了。一月三日的日报是动着纱锭三千四百五十六个，出纱线一千五百六十八磅。一月八日的日报即动了一万一千六百四十一个纱锭（以上皆以两班二十四小时计），出纱五千五百四十八磅。在阎匪统治时，用电力每个纱锭每日才能出一·三磅，现在用蒸汽动力，每日能出一·三五到一·四磅。工人们说：“现在就是只盼打下太原，拿回我们的机器，使全部机器动工。”
