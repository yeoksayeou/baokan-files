Precious Friendship
——A Farmer's Letter of Greeting to Frontline Soldiers

Gallant soldiers at the front:
    How was your New Year? Wishing you happiness and a joyous New Year!

    Recently, I heard that you are fighting very well, recovering many large cities. I also heard that you are preparing to cross the Yangtze River to eradicate Chiang Kai-shek's lair. The poor brothers throughout the country will soon be liberated. Speaking of this, I am reminded that it was only after you drove away the Japanese devils and the reactionary Kuomintang that I had food and clothing and could live a happy life. I often say, "Don't forget the well-digger when you drink water." You are shedding blood and sacrificing at the front, and I don't know how to thank you. I wanted to go to the front to fight the reactionaries with you and save the poor brothers throughout the country, but because I am not a healthy person, I feel very ashamed. Although I cannot join the army, I will do my best to help your families farm the land well, and I will also produce more grain to support the front.

    Now that the New Year has just passed, I wanted to pay you a New Year's visit and send you some gifts, but I have nothing to send. I have a little savings in hand, and people say, "A gift of goose feathers from a thousand miles away carries profound meaning despite its light weight." So, I decided to send 92,800 Jiao of Hebei currency to express my humble appreciation. I am a clumsy and inarticulate person, and I cannot say anything else. Now that the reactionary Kuomintang is about to collapse, let's at the front and in the rear work harder and quickly overthrow the reactionary Kuomintang completely, so that we can live in peace. I wish you good health!

    Enclosed with this letter is 92,800 Jiao of Hebei currency.

    Qiao Degui, farmer of Anziling Village, Eleventh District, Wu'an County, Taihang
    The seventh day of the first lunar month

    (Editor's note: This newspaper has forwarded the Hebei currency to the frontline troops on behalf of the sender.)

　　珍贵的友情
  　——一个农民写给前线将士们的慰问信英勇的前方将士们：
    你们年过的好吧，祝你们快乐，敬祝年禧！
    近来听说你们打仗打的很好，收复了许多大城市，又听说你们准备过长江剿蒋介石的老巢，全国穷弟兄眼看就要解放了。说到这里，就想起你们打跑了日本鬼和反动派国民党后，我才有了吃穿，痛痛快快过时光，常说：“吃水不忘打井人”，大家在前方流血牺牲，我不知该如何感谢你们。我有心到前方去和大家一起打反动派，救全国的穷弟兄，因为我是个不健康的人，我很觉得惭愧。虽然我不能参军，但是我要尽自己的力量来帮助你们家属把地种好，我也要多打粮食支援前线。
    现在刚过新年，我想给你们拜年送点礼物，但又没东西可送，手中有一点节余，人家说：“千里送鹅毛，礼轻人义重”，于是我就打定主意送上冀钞九万二千八百元，表示我一点心意。我是个嘴笨舌拙的人，也说不出别的话来，现在反动派国民党快完蛋了，咱们前后方再加加劲，快些把反动派国民党完全打倒，可好过太平日子。祝你们健康！
    随信附上冀钞九万二千八百元。
    太行武安县第十一区安子岭村
    农民乔德贵旧历正月初七日    　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　
    （编者按：冀钞已由本社代转前方部队。）
