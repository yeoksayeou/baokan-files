Li Liunu Freely Engaged
    Liu Xianglin
    Li Liunu, from Jianma Village, Third District, Hua County, is 18 years old. Her parents have been in Guanwai for many years, and she is the only one at home, residing in her uncle Wang Zhonglin's house in Wangtun. She has five mu of land managed by her uncle, who is also responsible for her living expenses.
    Last fall, the director of the Wangtun Farmers' Association introduced her to Yang San, who was eighteen years old. Her uncle disagreed. Although Li Liunu had met Yang San and was quite satisfied in her heart, she was bound by feudalism and dared not express her willingness, and thus often shed tears in distress.
    On the second day of the first month of the lunar calendar last year, through the matchmaking of Wang Sanni, Er Liu Lai, Langzi, and others, her uncle privately promised her to a man nicknamed "Fifth Mother" (40 years old) from Yangtun as his wife, and even had the "matchmaking" feast. When Li Liunu heard that Fifth Mother was more than 20 years older than her and had a bad reputation in the village, with some hooligan-like behavior, she immediately asked her uncle: "You didn't tell me and are making relatives with Yangtun. I don't agree, I won't get in the cart!" Her uncle said: "Fifth Mother is very strong, he can protect our family. If you don't agree, you can't make the decision! If you don't get in the cart, we'll tie you up and get you in!" From then on, her maternal grandmother and uncle constantly beat and threatened her.
    Li Liunu received education on marital autonomy in the land reform and democratic mobilization of women, and her awareness was raised. On the evening of January 14th (Gregorian calendar), she took her clothes and went straight to Yang San's house, stating that she must marry Yang San. Yang San had some concerns and dared not agree immediately; so he went to the village cadres. The next day, the village cadres led Li Liunu and Yang San to the district government to register and request proof. The district government approved it in accordance with the marital autonomy decree for men and women. Upon receiving the certificate, Li Liunu said with a joyful and shy smile to the cadres in the district: "Thank you!" Yang San then said to the village cadres: "If it weren't for the Communist Party and the democratic government, I wouldn't be able to marry this wife!" Li Liunu said: "Then, I would be too scared to do this!"

　　李留女自由订婚
    刘湘霖
    华县三区剪马村李留女，年十八岁，父母都去关外多年，家中只她一人，寄居在王屯他舅父王中林家，有五亩地由他舅经管，生活也由他舅父负责。
    去年秋后，王屯农会主任给留女介绍十八岁的杨三，她舅父不同意，留女因为见过杨三，心中虽很满意，可是被封建束缚着，不敢表露出来愿意，因而常常苦闷的落泪。
    去年元月初二日，经王三妮、二刘来、狼子等三人捏合，她舅私下将她许配杨屯绰号叫五妈妈的（年四十岁）为妻，也吃了“媒红”席。李留女听说后，打听五妈妈比自己大二十多岁，在村里又不正派，有些二流子偷摸行为，当时就问舅父：“你们不叫我知道，给杨屯做亲戚，我不同意，我不上车！”她舅说：“五妈妈很撑劲，能给咱挡门市，撑腰。你不愿意，你当不了家！你不上车，捆着也得上车！”从此，她外祖母及她舅父，不断地打骂威胁她。
    李留女在土地改革民主发动妇女中，受到了婚姻自主的教育，提高了觉悟，阳历一月十四日晚上，她携着自己的衣服包，直奔杨三家去，说明一定要与杨三结婚，杨三有些顾虑，不敢骤然答应；于是去找村干部。第二天，由村干领着李留女、杨三到区登记，请求证明，区政府按照男女婚姻自主法令就批准了。李留女接到证明文件，喜笑而含羞的向区里的干部说：“谢谢您了！”杨三接着向村干部说：“要不是咱共产党、民主政府来了，这个媳妇我可娶不上！”李留女说：“那，吓死我也不敢这样做呀！”
