Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 12th. According to an Associated Press report from Rangoon on the 7th: 30,000 Burmese government employees staged a walkout on the 7th, leaving government offices empty. The strike was in protest of the reactionary government of Thakin Nu, which, in order to persist in the anti-communist and anti-people civil war, did not hesitate to oppress government employees, reduce their living allowances, and cut staff by a quarter. Although the Thakin Nu government arrested the leaders of the Federation of Civil Service Associations who initiated the strike, a spokesman for the federation declared that civil servants would not return to work until the government rescinded its plan to reduce staff. The Thakin Nu reactionary government is intensifying its oppression of government employees because it is "currently facing the most serious financial crisis" (United Press, London, 2nd). The Thakin Nu government, which is waging a counter-revolutionary civil war, is suffering from high military expenditures, "this year's budget deficit will reach 190 million rupees (approximately 57 million US dollars), compared to 100 million rupees last year."

　　缅三万公务员罢工
  　政府机关空无一人
    【新华社陕北十二日电】据美联社仰光七日讯：缅甸公务员三万人于七日举行离职大罢工，政府机关中已空无一人。罢工系抗议达钦努反动政府为了坚持反共反人民的内战而不惜压迫公务员，减少他们的生活费津贴与裁减人员四分之一的决定。达钦努政府虽然逮捕了发动此次罢工的公务员协会联合会的领袖们，但该联合会的发言人宣称：公务职工在政府取消裁减人员的计划之前，将不复工。达钦努反动政府之所以加强压迫公务员，是因为它“目前正面临着最严重的财政危机”（合众社伦敦二日电）。进行反革命内战的达钦努政府，由于军费浩繁，“今年的预算赤字将达一亿九千万卢比（约合五千七百万美元），去年则为一亿卢比。”（美联社）
