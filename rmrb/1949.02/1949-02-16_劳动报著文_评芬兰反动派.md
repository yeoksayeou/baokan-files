Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, February 14th: The Soviet Labor Daily recently published an article titled "The Conspiracy of Finnish Reactionary Forces," stating: In the initial years after the war, Finland's democratic development ensured stability in its domestic and foreign policies. The pro-Soviet friendly policy pursued by Pikala's coalition government consolidated Finland's independence and provided favorable prerequisites for Finland's economic progress and the improvement of the material welfare of the broad masses. However, after the one-party government of the right-wing Social Democrat Fagerholm came to power at the end of July last year, the situation changed drastically. Fagerholm's government came to power with the support of two of the most reactionary parties (the National Coalition Party and the National Progressive Party). This new government immediately adopted reactionary policies in both domestic and foreign affairs. The right-wing Social Democrats and capitalists' attacks on the rights of working people and the intensification of political struggles have plunged Finland into serious economic difficulties. In the third quarter of 1948, Finland's industrial production decreased by 20% compared to the third quarter of 1947. Foreign trade has also declined. Imports in the second half of 1948 decreased by 17%, and exports decreased by 7%. Fagerholm himself also expected that "economic development will stop in 1949." The conclusion of the Soviet-Finnish trade treaty in December 1948 was regarded as almost the only bright spot during Fagerholm's six months in office. This treaty vividly reflects the Soviet Union's selfless spirit in hoping to help improve the situation of the Finnish people. Finland's economic difficulties have been exacerbated by the increasing chaos in the European market. The competition from American pulp and paper companies has caused considerable difficulties in Finland's export trade. The Fagerholm government, which does not dare to infringe upon the interests of Finland's "Twenty Families," is said to have adopted a policy of reducing wages "in order to create more favorable conditions for Finland's export trade." This policy, which aims to sacrifice the interests of workers in order to achieve "economic stability," has reduced the purchasing power of the people and brought industries that rely on the domestic market to a standstill. The attack by anti-democratic forces on the rights of working people is accompanied by increasing political reaction. The reactionaries dismiss employees with democratic ideas from government agencies; declare those who conceal weapons innocent; prematurely release major war criminals such as Donner, Linkomies, and Kivimäki; and, under the guise of the Riflemen's "Sports" Association, restore fascist organizations that had already been dissolved in accordance with the peace treaty. All of this has caused anxiety and concern among progressive people. Finnish democratic newspapers emphasize that the Fagerholm government is attempting to change Finland's foreign policy and turn to cooperation with the Western countries' aggressive bloc. The Labor Daily concludes: The broad masses of the Finnish people, who long for Finland's independence, are intensifying their resistance to the reactionary forces' attempts to establish political and economic domination and collude directly or indirectly with American and British expansionists.

  　评芬兰反动派
    【新华社陕北十四日电】苏联劳动报顷发表题为“芬兰反动势力的阴谋”的专文称：战后开头几年内，芬兰的民主发展保证了芬兰国内及国外政治上的稳定。皮可拉的联合政府所遵循的对苏友好政策，巩固了芬兰的独立，并为芬兰的经济进步和广大群众物质福利的改进提供了有利的先决条件。但是，当右翼社会民主党人法吉荷尔姆的一党政府在去年七月底上台以后，情势便发生了截然不同的改变。法吉荷尔姆的政府，是靠最反动的政党中两个政党（民族联盟及民族进步党）的支持而上台的。这个新政府立即在内政及外交政策上采取反动方针。右翼社会民主党人及资本家们对劳动人民权利的进攻以及政治斗争的加紧，已使芬兰面临严重的经济困难。一九四八年第三季内，芬兰工业品的产量，已比一九四七年第三季减少百分之廿。对外贸易也已下降。一九四八年下半年的进口减少百分之十七，出口减少百分之七。法吉荷尔姆自己也料到“经济发展将在一九四九年内停止”。一九四八年十二月苏芬贸易条约的缔结，被认为是法吉荷尔姆六个月活动期间几乎唯一无二的光明时刻。这一条约已生动地反映出苏联期望着帮助改善芬兰人民大众境况的大公无私精神。芬兰的经济困难，已因欧洲市场的日益混乱而加剧。美国纸浆及造纸公司的竞争，已在芬兰出口贸易中引起不小的困难。不敢触犯芬兰“二十家族”利益的法吉荷尔姆政府，据说是“为了给芬兰的出口贸易造成更有利的条件”，已采取减低工资的方针。这个旨在牺牲工人利益以求得“经济稳定”的政策，已减低了人民的购买力，并已使依靠国内市场的工业陷于停顿。反民主势力对劳动人民权利的进攻，是与增长着的政治反动相伴随的。反动派开除政府机关中有民主思想的雇员；宣告暗藏武器的人无罪；提前释放唐纳、林卡美斯、吉尾雅基等主要战争罪犯，在射手“体育”协会的伪装下，恢复原已依照和约解散的法西斯组织。这一切已引起进步人士的焦虑和关切。芬兰民主报纸着重指出，法吉荷尔姆政府企图改变芬兰的外交政策，转而与西方国家侵略集团合作。劳动报结语称：期望芬兰独立的芬兰广大人民，正在加紧抵抗，反对反动势力意欲建立政治及经济统治并与美英扩张主义者直接间接勾结的企图。
