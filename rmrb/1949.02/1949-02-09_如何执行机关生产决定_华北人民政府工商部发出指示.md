　　【This Newspaper Dispatch】 The Industry and Commerce Department of the North China People's Government, in order to correctly implement the "Decision on Agency Production" of the North China People's Government, issued instructions on January 27th. Excerpts are as follows: Recently, many agencies in various regions have been engaged in production, using their funds and other special advantages to engage in speculation and manipulation in the market, or disguising themselves as private merchants to conduct activities, or colluding with private merchants to provide behind-the-scenes support for them, in order to seek exorbitant profits. These illegal activities are one of the main reasons for the serious anarchy in our region's market in recent days. If they are not managed, they will inevitably weaken the leading position of the state-owned economy and strengthen the destructive role of private capitalism. Therefore, it is necessary for all localities to strengthen the management of the agency production that uses the old capitalist business methods and has a destructive effect on the market. The methods are as follows: 1. All localities should convene agency production meetings to announce the order of the North China People's Government, clearly pointing out the two routes of agency production management (the New Democratic route and the Old Capitalist route) and our different policies from the administrative and management aspects for agency production that takes two different routes (those of a New Democratic nature will be given assistance, while those of an Old Capitalist nature will be resolutely managed and sanctioned), and calling on all agency production to unite under the leadership of the government, cooperate with state-owned commerce and state banks, and oppose the speculation and manipulation of private capital. 2. In important markets (such as Shijiazhuang, Linqing, Changzhi, Handan, Cangxian, etc.), under the leadership of the local Industry and Commerce Bureau, an agency production management committee should be established, with the participation of responsible comrades from larger agency production units. The conditions for committee members are that they have a long revolutionary history, have a high degree of political awareness, and are of upright character. The agency production management committee should be responsible for managing agency production, promptly explaining policies to the various agency production units, regularly understanding the situation of agency production activities, helping them solve difficulties, and sanctioning certain activities that undermine policies. 3. The local Industry and Commerce Bureaus have the right to stop the following market-disrupting activities of agency production, and may, according to the seriousness of the circumstances, give the agency production unit warnings, fines, and even suspension of business: (1) those who fluctuate prices and disrupt the market; (2) those who jointly operate businesses with private merchants or collude with private merchants to engage in market-disrupting activities; (3) those who illegally engage in smuggling and tax evasion, or sell prohibited goods; (4) those who disguise themselves as private merchants and conduct activities in the market; (5) those who refuse to execute the orders of the agency production management committee and the Industry and Commerce Bureau. 4. For agency production that implements policies and regulations, obeys the leadership of the government, closely integrates with state banks and trade companies, jointly opposes speculation and manipulation, and supports cooperatives, the various local trade companies should, in accordance with government orders, provide assistance, and may purchase or sell certain commodities through them. 5. All agency production units should go through registration procedures with the government in accordance with the industrial and commercial registration methods. Localities should take the following measures to implement this: (1) A deadline should be set for registration. Those who fail to register after the deadline will have their business suspended. (2) The registration of shops in agency production units is limited to agency shops that were established before the issuance of the order by the North China People's Government. All agency shops established after the issuance of the order by the North China People's Government will not be allowed to register and will be ordered to close. (3) Registered agency production units should submit monthly business reports to the Industry and Commerce Bureau and the agency production management committee.

　　如何执行机关生产决定
  　华北人民政府工商部发出指示
    【本报讯】华北人民政府工商部为正确执行华北人民政府“关于机关生产的决定”，特于一月二十七日发出指示。略称：各地近有不少机关生产，利用其资金及其他特殊方便，在市场上进行投机操纵，或化装私商进行活动，或与私商勾结，予私商以幕后支持，以牟取暴利。这些非法行为，是近日来我区市场上严重的无政府现象的主要原因之一。如果不加管理，必然会削弱国营经济的领导地位，而增强了私人资本主义的破坏作用。因此各地对于上述用旧资本主义经营方法，对市场发生破坏作用的机关生产，必须认真加强管理，其办法如下：一、各地均应召集机关生产会，宣布华北人民政府命令，明确指出机关生产经营的两条路线（新民主主义路线与旧资本主义路线）及我们从行政上与经营上对于采取两条不同路线的机关生产的不同政策（对新民主主义性质的给以扶助，对旧资本主义性质的则予以坚决的管理与制裁），号召一切机关生产团结在政府领导下，与国营商业及国家银行合作，反对私人资本的投机操纵。二、在重要市场（如石庄、临清、长治、邯郸、沧县等），在当地工商局领导下，成立机关生产管理委员会，吸收较大的机关生产中的负责同志参加。委员的条件，是有较长的革命历史，有较高的政治认识，为人正派者。机关生产管理委员会应负管理机关生产的责任，及时向各机关生产说明政策，经常了解机关生产活动的情形，帮助他们解决困难，制裁其中某些破坏政策的活动。三、对于机关生产的下列破坏市场的活动，各地工商局有权加以制止，并根据其情节之轻重，对该机关生产予以警告，罚金，以至停业之处分：（一）波动物价，扰乱市场者。（二）与私商合营商业，或与私商勾结进行破坏市场活动者。（三）违法走私漏税，或贩卖违禁品者。（四）化装私商在市场上进行活动者。（五）拒绝执行机关生产管理委员会及工商局命令者。四、对于执行政策法令，服从政府领导，与国家银行及贸易公司密切结合，共同反对投机操纵，扶助合作社的机关生产，各地贸易公司均应根据政府命令，予以扶助，并可通过他们收购或出售一定的商品。五、机关生产应一律根据工商业登记办法，向政府实行登记手续，各地应采取以下办法执行：（一）限期举行登记，逾期不登记者，停止其营业。（二）机关生产中商店之登记，以华北人民政府发布命令前业已成立之机关商店为限。凡在华北人民政府发布命令以后成立之机关商店，一律不许登记，并勒令停业。（三）已登记之机关生产，应按月向工商局及机关生产管理委员会举行业务汇报。
