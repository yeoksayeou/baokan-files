　　Seeing the Light
  　An Account of Liberation Soldier Zhang Qingbao
    Tai Tiancai
    Zhang Qingbao was a liberation soldier who was liberated during the Chahar Campaign (Spring 1948). He was the only son of a poor peasant family, about twenty-four or five years old, with a ruddy complexion and a robust physique. He was of medium height and simple in nature. When speaking to people he wasn't very familiar with, his face would flush red, as if he had a bit of a stutter. After joining the People's Liberation Army, he was always smiling. No one ever saw him unhappy. Even if he was a little awkward, it would quickly pass. He put all his effort into learning and fighting, working hard without complaint. He experienced the meaning of life that comes from liberating oneself through one's own struggle. He often said, "Everything now is for my own benefit."
　　(1)
    Zhang Qingbao was from inside the Great Wall. When he was eight years old, the whip of life meant his father could no longer afford the food and clothing for his mother and him, so the whole family was forced to leave their beloved hometown and go outside the Great Wall. They settled in a small village near Baotou, and through introductions, rented some land from the landlord Mr. Wang Er to cultivate. Seeds and farm tools were temporarily provided by Mr. Wang Er and would be gradually repaid later. This was how they finally had a place to settle.
    They went out early and returned late, working hard and enduring the scorching sun and the wind and sand of the frontier. They fought against nature day after day. His mother helped his father in the fields, and Qingbao was also deprived of his precious childhood life by many household chores.
    Whenever the grass withered and the leaves fell, and the crops ripened, the three of them were busy harvesting their crops. At this time, Mr. Wang Er came to demand that they pay the rent and repay the advances, and also increase the interest. This shattered the hopes of the three of them. All the harvest was paid to Mr. Wang Er, but it was not enough. The hopes of his father and mother turned cold. In the end, they asked someone to plead for them and, under new and more stringent conditions, left a small amount of grain from the harvest to sustain their lives. All the debts owed to the landlord were considered as the principal, and interest was added to the principal. It was said that this was still an "extraordinary favor." The chains of life bound these three unfortunate people, making it impossible to break free.
    The Japanese devils ruled Baotou for eight years, and their suffering deepened with the Japanese devils' brutal exploitation. The exploitation of the second landlord did not diminish in the slightest. They toiled like cattle and horses all year round, ending up unable to keep warm and unable to eat enough. Although Qingbao grew up with the passage of time, there was no way to improve or alleviate their painful living environment.
　　(2)
    In August 1945, the Japanese devils surrendered. The Kuomintang seized Baotou, and Qingbao's family also fantasized that life might take a turn for the better. They never expected that their suffering would increase even more: the Baojia chiefs and local bullies came to oppress the kind-hearted peasants. Before one apportionment was paid off, a new one was issued. On the account books of the large village, his family was always a regular customer with unclear debts, and sometimes even the accounting clerk said, "Such transcription of accounts is superfluous and troublesome!" Because they really couldn't come up with anything. However, the local bullies didn't think so, and said, "We must squeeze four taels of oil even from buckwheat husks." The land rent and debt interest of the second landlord, Mr. Wang Er, was even more of a death warrant for his family. The family's food was almost entirely taken away. His father was so desperate that he had to hide outside during the day like a night owl, and only dared to return home in the middle of the night.
    In 1947, on a cold, windy night, the neighbor's dog barked wildly, and footsteps stopped outside their door. His mother whispered to Qingbao, "Qingbao, take a look through the window hole, is your father back!" Just then, there was a very urgent knock on the door, which startled the mother and son. Outside, someone shouted loudly to open the door. Qingbao's mother realized that it was either Mr. Wang Er who had sent someone to demand rent and debt, or the Baojia chief and local bullies to urge for grain payment. So she replied from inside the door: "Qingbao's father has not returned yet." Then the people outside impatiently shouted that they must open the door. Helpless, they had to open the door. At this moment, two people rushed in fiercely, twisted Qingbao's arm and pulled him outside. His mother knelt on the ground and begged, but was kicked down. Qingbao was thus twisted and tied away. His mother's crying was of no avail. Qingbao and the shadows of the local bullies disappeared into the darkness. The neighbor's dog also stopped barking, leaving only the quiet, terrible black night and Qingbao's mother's weeping.
    When he arrived at the large village office, Qingbao learned that he was to be conscripted into the army. He repeatedly asked to go home to tell his mother, but was not allowed. He was sent away that night.
    Qingbao was imprisoned in the Kuomintang army. He was only given some thin porridge to eat every day and was locked in a dark, damp, and cold small room. After staying there for more than ten days, he was called out to change into a military uniform and began to live a life of "one, two, one." His legs ached from exhaustion, and he didn't even have the strength to get into bed at night. He missed his home, his father, and his mother even more, and tears streamed down from the corner of his blanket.
    Qingbao, who had been accustomed to farm life since childhood, was not so agile in his movements. The squad leader only taught the drills once, and if he did it wrong the second time, he would be severely scolded. Terms such as "idiot," "fool," and "good-for-nothing" became the squad leader's pronouns for Qingbao. He was even constantly subjected to punches and kicks. Once, Qingbao was thinking about his mother on the training ground and didn't hear what the squad leader said. Then a burning slap landed on his face, and his mind went blank. He almost fell down. Qingbao would never forget this incident.
    The veteran soldiers were also happily teasing Qingbao, and everyone called him "dumb ox." All the strenuous chores in the squad were pushed onto him. After drill, everyone else rested, but Qingbao still had to do this and that, helping the cook. The cook also looked down on him, constantly giving him dirty looks.
    Several months passed, and he got used to the life. Then two new recruits were added, and the squad leader assigned him the task of monitoring and guarding them. If the new recruits ran away, he would be held fully responsible. This made things even more difficult for Qingbao. The new recruits' suffering was unbearable, but he was even more miserable than the new recruits.
    One of the new recruits lived not far from Qingbao's home and told Qingbao that his mother had been sick for a while, but he didn't know what happened after that.
    He had also asked someone to write a few letters home on his behalf, but they disappeared like stones thrown into the sea. Later, he simply stopped caring about this matter.
    Last year, our army attacked Baotou, and the battle began. Bullets kept whizzing over their heads. After a fierce battle, the enemy was annihilated, and Qingbao was also liberated.
    "The officers used to say that no matter what, we must not let the People's Liberation Army capture us alive. If we are captured alive, we will be buried alive or killed with knives. Now I have been captured. Will I die? But although I also fired my gun in the battle, I didn't hit a single People's Liberation Army soldier! ... Let's wait and see. Perhaps those cursed officers will be killed, which they deserve! I am a soldier, maybe I won't die." Qingbao kept thinking about these questions in his mind.
    However, the soldiers of the People's Liberation Army comforted him and told him not to be afraid. One person passed by, and then another came. Everyone spoke so kindly and gently, which was something he had never seen in his original army. They felt even more affectionate than his own parents and brothers. Qingbao's mood calmed down. He thought that what the officers had said before was really nonsense. The People's Liberation Army treats prisoners leniently.
    After a short period of ideological education, Qingbao joined our army. He was warmly welcomed and comforted at the time. In the evening, the squad leader also convened the whole squad to hold a tea party and chat, introducing the living conditions of the army. The comrades in the squad were so enthusiastic that he felt real revolutionary friendship and warmth. Compared with his original army life, he simply couldn't bear to think about it. Qingbao almost burst into tears at this moment.
    Once, Qingbao fell ill and couldn't even eat. The comrades in the squad pooled their money to buy him eggs to eat. When everyone returned from drill, they all gathered around Qingbao to comfort him. Even though the company commander and instructor were so busy, they still came to see him twice a day. This was something Qingbao had rarely experienced even at home. Qingbao felt really sorry. When his illness eased slightly, he struggled to get up.
    The army had a mission to move, and Qingbao's body was still very weak. The platoon leader asked him how he was, whether he could persist in the march. If he couldn't, he would ask the superiors to find a way to mobilize a donkey to ride. Qingbao had heard more than once during political class that the people's army should resolutely protect the interests of the people and cherish the people's strength, so he did not hesitate to decline the platoon leader's kindness, saying that he could persist in the march. During the march, the comrades in the squad helped him carry his bedding and weapons. All the way, he thought in his heart, "As long as my legs can move forward one step, I must grit my teeth and persevere, and not fall behind."
    Strangely enough, in the bandit army, everyone mocked Qingbao as a "dumb ox," but now he has become smart. Everyone often felt that the methods he came up with were very good. The comrades in the squad all had a good impression of him. At the squad affairs meeting, he was praised several times. The squad leader called on the whole squad to learn from his spirit of enduring hardship, working hard, uniting, and actively learning. Qingbao became even more active. He thought to himself, "If I don't do a good job, I will really be letting everyone down."
    Since being liberated and joining the army, he has participated in two battles, showing bravery and composure. He has captured two guns and two prisoners in battle. At the merit evaluation meeting, everyone agreed to record two minor merits.
    Combat team leader Chen Shiwu was liberated less than half a year earlier than him. Because he was brave in battle, resolutely carried out orders, and led the new recruits to complete arduous tasks, and he also worked very well at ordinary times, everyone thought that he could be awarded a major merit; and some people proposed to suggest to the branch to admit him into the Party. This incident sparked a fire of admiration in Zhang Qingbao's heart. He thought: How glorious it is to be a Communist Party member!
    Through real-life experience and constant political education, Zhang Qingbao deeply understood the warmth of the people's army and the greatness of the Communist Party. He saw his own light and believed that following the Communist Party forever was his bright road. Sometimes he thought of his mother, who he heard had been sick for many days, and his father, who was hiding and afraid to see people, and he felt a little melancholy, but it also increased Qingbao's courage to fight to the end and resolutely take revenge. Sometimes he also thought that there would always be such a day in the future, like Chen Shiwu, when everyone would propose at the meeting: "Zhang Qingbao is a good comrade, and it is suggested that the branch admit him into the Party." This made him so excited that he laughed out loud unconsciously.

　　看到了光明
  　记解放战士张庆宝
    邰天才
    张庆宝是察南战役（一九四八年春）解放过来的解放战士，他是一个贫苦农民人家的独生子，二十四五岁，脸色红红的，身体很健壮，中长的身材，性情质朴，见了不大相熟的人，一说话就红胀了脸，好象有些口吃。参加人民解放军以后，常是笑嘻嘻的，没有看到他在什么时候不痛快，就是有点蹩扭，也很快的就过去了。学习、战斗、都是卖尽力气，任劳任怨，他体验了只有自己奋斗来解放自己的人生意义。他常说：“现在的一切都是为了自己干的。”
　　（一）
    张庆宝是口里人，八岁时候，生活的鞭子，使他父亲再也负担不起他母亲和他的衣食，全家被迫不得不离开自己亲爱的家乡，到口外去。他们到了包头附近的一个小村庄里住下，经人说合，租了二地主王二先生的一些土地耕种，种籽和耕具暂由王二先生来供给，以后逐次归还，这样总算是有了安身之地。
    早出晚归，辛勤劳累，饱尝着塞外的烈日爆晒，朔风砂砾的吹打，这样的一天一天的和自然在搏斗着；他母亲帮同他父亲一起下田里去，庆宝也同样被许多农家的零碎事情，把自己宝贵的童年生活剥夺了。
    每当草衰叶落，庄稼熟了，他们三个人正忙着收割自己的庄稼。这时期王二先生来了，要他们缴纳地租和偿还铺垫，还要增加利息。这样把他们三个人的生活希望打破了；收获物全部付给了王二先生还不够，他父亲母亲的热望变成冰冷。没办法，又请人求情，在新的更加苛刻条件下，把收获的粮食留下少许来苟延自己的生命。所有欠地主数目，作为债本，按本加息，据说这还是“格外的恩赐”。生活的锁链就这样的束缚着这三口苦命人，牢牢的摆脱不开。
    日本鬼子在包头统治了八年，他们的苦难日子随着日本鬼子的残酷压榨更加深剧，二地主的剥削没有丝毫减轻，牛马一样的终年勤劳，落得一个个衣不能御寒，饭不足果腹，庆宝虽然随年月的增长而长大成人，但是没有办法改善或减轻他们的痛苦生活环境。
　　（二）
    一九四五年八月，日本鬼子投降了，国民党抢夺了包头，庆宝一家子虽也幻想过，生活或者能有转机。绝没想到是会更增加了他们的苦难：保甲长和乡丁都张牙舞爪的来欺压善良的农民，这一次摊派还没有交完，又有新的派出来。大乡的摊款簿记上，欠款不清的各户，他家总是经常的老主顾，有时连管帐先生也说：“这样的转誊帐目是多余费事！”因为实在的拿不出东西来。然而乡丁们则不以为然，却说：“荞麦皮子也要榨他四两油。”二地主王二先生的地租和债息，更是他们一家子的催命符，一家的口粮都要的精光，父亲迫的没法过，象夜鹰一样，白天只得到外面躲起来，半夜里才得回家。
    一九四七年，一个冷风飕飕的夜里，邻家的狗狂吠了起来，脚步声停止在他们的门外，母亲向庆宝悄悄的说：“庆宝，你从窗洞看一下，你父亲回来了吧！”正在这当儿，敲门声很急，使得母子俩大吃一惊。外面大声喊叫开门，庆宝的母亲意识到：不是王二先生派人来索租债，便是保甲长乡丁来催要粮款了。于是在门里回答：“庆宝爹还没有回来。”接着外面不耐烦的叫着一定要开门，没奈何他们只好把门开开，这时突然恶狠狠地进来两个人，扭着庆宝的胳膊就往外拉，他母亲跪在地上哀求，被踢倒了。庆宝就这样被扭着绑走了。他母亲的哭叫无济于事，庆宝和乡丁们的影子在黑暗中消逝了，邻家的狗也不叫了，只剩下静静的可怕的漆黑的夜和庆宝母亲的哭泣。
    到了大乡公所，庆宝才知道要他去当兵，再三要求回家去告诉母亲一声，终没有被允许，当天夜里就把他送走了。
    庆宝在国民党部队里被囚禁着，一天只给点稀粥吃，关在一个阴暗潮湿冰冷的小屋里。待了十几天，才叫出来换上了军衣，每天过起“一、二、一”的生活来，累的两腿疼痛，黑夜连上炕的气力都没有了。更加想起自己的家，父亲和母亲，泪水一滴一滴的从被角淌下来。
    从幼就习贯农家生活的庆宝，动作起来不是那么灵活，班长教操只来一次，第二次不对了就要受到恶骂，“笨蛋”、“傻瓜”、“饭桶”等称呼成了班长喊庆宝的代名词，他甚至还不断的受到拳打脚踢。有一次在操场上庆宝正在想他的母亲，没有听清班长说了声什么，接着一记耳光热辣辣的便打在他脸上，脑子一晕，几乎倒了下去，这件事庆宝永远不会忘记。
    老兵们也都在嘻皮笑脸的找庆宝开心，大家都叫他“笨牛”，班里有什么出力气的勤务都推在他身上。操练回来，大家都休息了，庆宝还得做这做那，帮伙夫做饭，伙夫也看不上他，不时的给他些眼色看。
    几个月过去了，生活也习惯下来；又补来两个新兵，班长分配了他的任务，要他来监视看守。新兵如果跑了的话，要他负完全责任，这样使得庆宝更为难了。新兵的痛苦是难受的，但是他比新的还要苦。
    有一个新兵离庆宝家不太远，告诉庆宝说他母亲曾经病了一个时期，以后的情形便不知道了。
    他也曾托人代笔给家里写过几次信，但是如石投大海一样的杳无消息，后来他也干脆丢开这种心事不管了。
    去年我军进攻包头，战斗开始了，枪弹不断的从头上呼啸着飞过去，经过激烈的战斗之后，敌人被歼灭了，庆宝也被解放了出来。
    “平日军官们常说，不论怎样，在战斗中不能让人民解放军活捉，被活捉了就是要活埋或刀杀的，我今天被俘了，是不是会死了呢？不过我在战斗中虽然也打了枪来，可是没有打着过一个人民解放军啊！…………等着看吧，或许是杀那些该诅咒的军官们，那是活该！我是一个兵啊，也许不会死吧。”………庆宝脑子里不断的想着这些问题。
    但是，人民解放军的战士们，给了他安慰，让他不要害怕。一个人过去了，又来了另一个人，大家说话都是那么的和和气气的，这是在他原来的队伍中所没有见过的情形，比自己的父母兄弟还觉得亲热的多，庆宝的心情安定下来了。心想军官们从前所说的话，真是见了鬼，人民解放军是宽待俘虏的。
    庆宝经过了短期的思想教育，即参加了我军，当时受到了热烈的欢迎和慰问，晚上班长又召集全班举行茶话漫谈，介绍了部队的生活情形，班里的同志们都是那么热情，使他感到了真正的革命友爱温暖，和自己原来部队的生活比起来，简直不能想下去，庆宝这当儿几乎掉下眼泪来。
    有一次庆宝病了，连饭都吃不进去，班里的同志们凑了钱给他买鸡蛋吃，大家下操回来，便都围在庆宝的周围慰问他。连长和指导员工作虽是那样的忙碌，一天还要来看他两回，这是庆宝连在家里也少有过的事情。庆宝实在过意不去，病稍微轻了些，便扎挣着起来。
    部队有任务要行动了，庆宝的身体还很弱，排长问他怎么样，是否可以坚持行军，如果不行的话，向上级要求想办法，动员一个毛驴骑。庆宝在上政治课的时候，不只一次的听到说人民军队要坚决保护人民利益，爱惜民力，所以毫不犹豫的谢绝了排长的好意，说是可以坚持行军。在行军的时候，班里的同志们大家帮助他背了被包和武器，他一路上心里想“只要我的腿能前移一步，也要咬牙坚持，不能掉队。”
    说也奇怪，在匪军部队中，大家都嘲庆宝是个“笨牛”，现在他却变聪明了，想出的办法大家都常觉到很好，班里同志都对他有着好的印象，在班务会上他几次受到了表扬，班长号召全班学习他的吃苦、耐劳、团结、积极学习的精神。庆宝更是积极了，他心里捉摸着：如果不好好干，真是对不起大家了。
    自解放参军之后，他已参加过两次战斗，表现勇敢沉着，在战斗中缴过两支枪，捉了两个俘虏，评功会上，大家同意记了两个小功。
    战斗小组长陈世武，比他早解放不到半年。因为战斗勇敢，坚决执行命令，带领新兵完成了艰巨的任务，平时工作也很好，大家意见都认为可以立个大功；并且有人提出向支部建议吸收入党。这件事在张庆宝的心里放出了欣慕的火花来，心想：一个共产党员够多么光荣啊！
    实际的生活体验和不断的政治教育，张庆宝深深的领会了人民军队的温暖和共产党的伟大，看见了自己的光明，认定永远跟着共产党走，才是自己的光明大道。有时想起了听说病过多日的母亲和躲着不敢见人的父亲来，不觉有点怅惘，但也更增加了庆宝斗争到底，坚决复仇的勇气，有时也想到了将来总会有这么一天，也象陈世武一样，在会议上被大家提出来：“张庆宝是个好同志，建议支部吸收他入党。”使他兴奋地不自觉的笑出声来。
