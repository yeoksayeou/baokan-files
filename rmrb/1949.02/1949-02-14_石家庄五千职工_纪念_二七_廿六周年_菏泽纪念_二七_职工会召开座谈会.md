　　Shijiazhuang Five Thousand Workers
    Commemorate the 26th Anniversary of "February 7th"
    Heze Commemorates "February 7th": Trade Union Holds Symposium
    [Shijiazhuang News] On the afternoon of the 7th, over five thousand workers from seventy public and private factories in Shijiazhuang held a commemorative meeting for the 26th anniversary of the "February 7th" strike. Li Zaiwen, Director of the Preparatory Committee of the North China Federation of Trade Unions, Liu Xiufeng of the Municipal Party Committee, and Mayor Ke Qingshi were all present to provide guidance. After the meeting opened, Liang Yongfu, an old worker from the "February 7th" strike and chairman of the meeting, delivered the opening remarks. He called on the workers to step up production to support the front lines, fight to the south of the Yangtze River, and liberate all of China. Comrade Liu Xiufeng of the Municipal Party Committee outlined the struggles of the past twenty-six years since the "February 7th" strike, and then said passionately: "Now we have driven Chiang Kai-shek, who is even more wicked than Wu Peifu, to the background. The freedom and liberation that the 'February 7th' strike fought for will soon be realized throughout the country! The working class should continue to carry forward the revolutionary spirit of anti-imperialism and anti-feudalism to support the front lines, step up production, oppose the fake peace of the Kuomintang reactionaries, and carry the revolution through to the end." Comrade Xiufeng finally called on everyone to become pioneers of production and leaders in managing the people's democratic republic. Under the leadership of the Party, we should study hard, produce hard, and commemorate the "February 7th" strike with practical actions. Mayor Ke pointed out in his speech that the primary task of Shijiazhuang workers is to unite and resolutely smash the "peace" conspiracy of American imperialism and its running dog, the Chiang Kai-shek bandit gang. Secondly, we must strengthen our ranks more resolutely, raise our awareness, do a good job in production to support the front lines, and build the people's Shijiazhuang. After speeches by Li Bin, a member of the preparatory committee of the Municipal Federation of Trade Unions, and Comrade Zhao Mengxiang of the electric light company, the meeting unanimously passed a telegram of respect to Chairman Mao in the name of the meeting, and expressed firm support for the eight peace terms proposed by Chairman Mao. After shouting slogans, the meeting held a torchlight parade.
    [Another News] The Shijiazhuang "February 7th" Preparatory Committee, in order to strengthen the understanding of "February 7th" on all railway lines, sent representative delegations from the east and west lines on the 4th of this month to hold symposiums along the way. The east line representatives were Su Changqing and others (four people), and the west line representatives were Cui En'yuan and others (five people). In addition to old workers from the "February 7th" strike, the two delegations also included members of the Railway Bureau's Federation of Trade Unions and representatives from the city who attended the Second National Labor Congress.
    [Ji Lu Yu Dispatch] The Heze Trade Union commemorated the 26th anniversary of "February 7th" by convening over a thousand male and female workers from the Xinhua Bookstore, the Automobile Company, the cigarette factory, and other units in the city, and held a symposium at the People's Theater. At the meeting, it was reflected that although the city has been liberated for more than four months, due to the failure to do a good job in the workers' work, the working class has not been well organized, and some workers are still deceived and confused by the rumors of bad elements. In particular, female workers in some factories are still being subjected to discrimination and humiliation. The treatment of workers in some private factories is still very unreasonable, and these problems urgently need to be resolved. Leading cadres of the Trade Union expressed their determination to effectively solve these problems in the future.

    【又讯】石市“二七”筹委会为了加强各铁线对“二七”的认识，曾于本月四日派出东西线代表团，沿路分别召开座谈会。东线代表为苏长庆等四人，西线为崔恩元等五人。两代表团除有“二七”老工友外，尚有铁路局总工会委员与本市出席全国第二次劳大代表参加。
    【冀鲁豫电】菏泽职工会纪念“二七”廿六周年，召集了本城新华书店、汽车公司、烟厂等男女工人千余人，在民众剧院举行座谈会。会上，反映出本城虽已解放四个多月，但由于职工工作没作好，工人阶级尚没有很好组织起来，某些工人们还受着坏分子的谣言欺骗迷惑，特别是女工在某些工厂里还受着轻视和被侮辱的现象；一些私营工厂的工人待遇还非常不合理，这些问题都急待解决。职工会领导干部表示决心要在今后切实解决这些问题。
