　　Drives Through the Border to Celebrate the Liberation of Beiping
　　Xuchang to Yancheng Section of Pinghan Railway Repaired
    [Xinhua News Agency, Shenyang, 8th] The workers of the Huangguantun Railway Factory in Shenyang, overcoming various difficulties in the middle of last month, repaired an old locomotive and named it "Beiping" to drive through the border to welcome the liberation of Beiping. This locomotive was originally discarded in a pile of scrap iron. The body was dilapidated, the parts were incomplete, and it was impossible to move at all. In order to repair this scrap car, the workers displayed a high degree of labor enthusiasm and creative talent. Under the condition of "no dismantling of other cars to piece together," they launched a competition, mutual assistance, material contribution, and waste transformation movement, so that many parts that were difficult to buy could be replenished one by one. Some workers carried out repair work day and night for twelve days from the 6th to the 17th of last month, sleeping only three or four hours a day. Other workers participated in the repair work after work every day and without rest on Sundays. When the "Beiping" locomotive was repaired and left the factory at noon on the 18th of last month, more than 2,000 employees of the factory held a completion ceremony, and the workers of the factory were also commended by their superiors at the meeting. The "Beiping" locomotive drove to the border for the first time on the 20th. All the employees of the Huangguantun Railway Factory, with class friendship, jointly wrote a letter to the railway employees in the Beiping area, wishing them liberation. The employees of the Huangguantun Railway Factory wrote in the letter: "We sincerely congratulate you on your liberation. All 2,500 employees of our factory have truly turned over and stood up under the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party since our liberation on November 2nd last year. We have changed our old labor attitude, we have turned the factory into our own home, and we have become the masters of the factory. At the end of last year, when the People's Liberation Army advanced into the border to prepare for the liberation of Tianjin and Beiping, all the employees of our factory were overjoyed and launched an initiative to repair two locomotives in addition to completing the production tasks for January, one named "Beiping" to welcome the liberation of Beiping and celebrate your liberation." After briefly describing the process of repairing the locomotive, they wrote: "Although the "Beiping" is not the most perfect locomotive, it is a gift created by the blood and sweat of all our employees and expresses our little intention. May we, under the leadership of the great Communist Party, tightly join hands with the railway employees inside and outside the border, step up production, manage our people's railways well, support the national liberation war to eliminate the Kuomintang reactionary forces, and strive for the early victory of the national revolution!
    [Xinhua News Agency, Zhengzhou, 8th] The Xuchang to Yancheng section of the Pinghan Railway was urgently repaired and completed on January 26th. The repair project is 106 li long, with 29 large and small bridges. It was started on January 12th by more than 1,100 railway employees and more than 4,900 civilian workers. A total of more than 80,000 sleepers, 1,695 rails, more than 24,500 splints, and more than 313,000 spikes were used. When the engineering team returned to Zhengzhou after the completion of the project, people from all walks of life went to the station to welcome them.

    【新华社沈阳八日电】沈阳皇姑屯铁路工厂的工人们，于上月中旬克服种种困难，修复一辆旧机车，把它命名为“北平号”，开进关内，以迎接北平的解放。这辆机车，原来是被扔在废铁堆里的废物，车身破旧，机件残缺，根本已不可能行走。工人们为了修复这辆废车，曾经发挥了高度的劳动热忱和创造才能，在“不许拆别的车来拼”的条件下，发动了竞赛、互助、献材和改造废物的运动、使难以买到的许多零件，得以一一补齐。有些工人从上月六日至十七日的十二天中，连日连夜的进行修理工作，每天只睡三四个钟点。另有一些工人则在每天下班后加班，星期日不休息的情形下，参加修理工作。当上月十八日中午，“北平号”机车修好出厂时，全厂二千多职工举行了机车落成典礼大会，全厂的工人们，也在这个会上受到了上级的表扬。“北平号”机车于二十日首次开往关内。皇姑屯铁路工厂的全体职工，又以阶级的友爱，联名给北平区的铁路职工写信，预祝他们的解放。皇姑屯铁路工厂的职工们在信中写道：“我们衷心祝贺你们的解放。我们全厂二千五百职工，自去年十一月二日解放以后，在中国共产党领导下，我们真正的翻了身，站起来了。我们改变了旧的劳动态度，我们把工厂变成了自己的家，我们成了工厂的主人。去年年底，当人民解放大军挺进关内，准备解放平津的时候，我们全厂职工欢欣若狂，发起在完成一月份生产任务外，修复二台机车，一台定名“北平号”，以迎接北平的解放，庆贺你们的翻身。”他们在简单地叙述修复机车的经过后，又写道：“北平号”虽不是最完美的机车，但这是我们全体职工血汗创造的礼物，表达我们一点儿心意。愿我们在伟大的共产党领导下，关内关外的铁路职工紧紧的拉起手来，加紧生产，办好我们的人民铁路，支援全国解放战争消灭国民党反动势力，争取全国革命早日胜利！
