　　Shijiazhuang-to-Beijing-Tianjin Postal Route Now Open
　　[This Newspaper] After more than a month of preparation by the North China Postal and Telecommunications Administration, and with the strong support of the Ministry of Communications and the close cooperation of the Highway Administration and the Transportation Company, the entire postal line from Shijiazhuang to Beijing and Tianjin was opened on February 1st. The more than 600-li automobile postal route between Shijiazhuang and Beijing is connected to trains, and can arrive in at most one day. Before the trains to Beijing and Tianjin are fully operational, a 328-li horse-drawn postal route has also been established between Baoding and Tianjin. A pack animal postal route connects Changxindian and the Qinghe Station on the Beijing-Suiyuan Railway (which will soon be directly accessible by train to Zhangjiakou). Therefore, Shijiazhuang is now fully connected with major cities such as Beijing, Tianjin, Baoding, and Zhangjiakou. It can directly connect to the Northeast through Tianjin, reach East China and the Central Plains through Dezhou, and reach Jin-Sui, Shaanxi-Gansu-Ningxia through Yuci in the west. It can be said to be well-connected in all directions, which is extremely convenient.
　　In terms of business, the Shijiazhuang city and all North China post offices have been ordered to accept ordinary mail and registered mail from Beijing, Tianjin and other places. Parcel remittance is also being actively prepared and will be opened soon. In addition to the already smooth plain mail and registered mail with various liberated areas, all cities and counties in North China and Shandong (such as Jinan, Xuzhou, Weifang, Yantai, Weihaiwei, Dezhou, Zhoucun, Zhangdian, Jining, etc.) can mutually send parcels and remittances. In addition, the North China Postal and Telecommunications Administration has reached an agreement with the Jin-Sui Postal Administration on mutual parcel delivery with more than 30 counties in southern Shanxi, such as Linfen and Yuncheng; consultations are underway on through-parcel and through-remittance with Shaanxi-Gansu-Ningxia.

　　Xinhua News Agency, Tangshan, 3rd [of February]—Thanks to the efforts of all postal and telecommunications workers, Tangshan's postal, telecommunications and transportation are now well-connected in all directions. On December 13th, the day after Tangshan was liberated, the post office began postal service with various liberated areas. On January 15th, Tianjin was liberated, and the postal route immediately opened to Tianjin. Long-distance telephone service was opened to Guye, Linxi, Lutai and other places a few days after liberation. After the workers rushed to repair the hundred-mile telephone line between Luanxian and Shanhaiguan, which was severely damaged by the Chiang bandits, wired telegraphs and long-distance telephone service between Tangshan and Shanhaiguan began to report and talk. On the 21st, it also talked with Tianjin. So far, the telegraph and telephone communications between Tianjin and Shanhaiguan for more than 250 kilometers have been unimpeded. The number of telephone subscribers in Tangshan city has increased from 1,067 to 861 at the time of liberation due to the destruction and dismantling by the Kuomintang bandit troops when they fled, and has now increased to 1,074.

　　石家庄至平津邮线畅通
    【本报讯】石家庄至平津两地之邮线，经华北邮电总局月余筹备，在交通部大力扶助及公路总局与运输公司密切配合之下，至二月一日全线畅通。石家庄至北平间六百余里的汽车邮线，与火车衔接，最迟一日即可到达。在平津火车尚未全部通达前，又特在保定天津之间建立了三百二十八里的马车邮线。自长辛店与平绥路清河站之间则用驮班邮线接通（不日即可由火车直达张家口）。所以目前石家庄与平津保张各大城市已经完全联络起来，经过天津可直通东北，经过德州可通达华东、中原，西经榆次通晋绥、陕甘宁，可谓四通八达，极为便利。
    在业务方面，现石庄市及全华北邮局已奉命接收平津等地普通邮件与挂号邮件。包裹汇兑亦正积极筹备，不久即可开办。与各解放区除平件挂号早已畅通外，所有华北与山东各县市（如济南、徐州、潍坊、烟台、威海卫、德州、周村、张店、济宁等地）均可互寄包裹汇兑。此外与晋南临汾、运城等三十余县之包裹互寄，华北邮电总局亦与晋绥邮管局获得协议；与陕甘宁的通包通汇现正进行协商中。（华北邮电总局苏塘）
    【新华社唐山三日电】唐山市邮电交通，由于全体邮电职工的努力，现已四通八达。唐山解放的次日，即十二月十三日，邮局即开始与各解放区通邮。一月十五日天津解放，邮路立即通至天津。长途电话于解放后数日即通古冶、林西、芦台等地。一月上旬被蒋匪严重破坏的滦县至山海关间百余里电话线路经工人抢修恢复，唐山至山海关间的有线电报及长途电话即开始通报通话。二十一日，又与天津通话。至此，天津至山海关二百五十余公里间之电报电话交通已畅通无阻。唐市市内电话用户，因国民党匪军逃走时破坏拆卸、致解放时已由一千零六十七家减至八百六十一家，现已增至一千零七十四家。
