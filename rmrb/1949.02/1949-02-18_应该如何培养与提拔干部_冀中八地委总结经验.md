Central Hebei Electric Dispatch: The Eighth Prefectural Committee, in the months of October, November, and December, cultivated and promoted 1,806 cadres at the district and county levels. At the end of September, according to the old system statistics for the Eighth District, there was a shortage of 38 key county cadres, 177 general cadres, 350 key district cadres, and 248 general cadres. By the end of December, according to the new system statistics, 42 key county cadres, 572 general cadres, 246 key district cadres, and 946 general cadres had been added. The reasons for achieving the above results are: First, county and district cadres recognized the importance of cultivating and promoting cadres under the new situation; second, testing and educating promoted cadre candidates in a planned manner during work; third, the method of mentoring and holding short-term training courses is the best and fastest way to promote village cadres to district cadres; fourth, leaders must closely supervise and inspect from top to bottom. In the implementation, some cadres did not fully understand the political significance of cultivating and promoting cadres and "cadres determine everything" under the new situation, which led to the viewpoint of simply completing the task. This was reflected in the fact that some of the promoted cadres were not active elements with pure backgrounds, correct work styles, tested by the masses, and supported by the masses. For example, the Third District of Hejian promoted an individual who had served as an adjutant in the Kuomintang army and colluded with Japanese invaders and traitors to undermine the interests of the people to be an assistant district officer. The Tenth District of Jiahe promoted a person who had been sentenced to imprisonment by our government and had not yet completed his term. Second, some cadres had excessively high demands on the promotion candidates, measuring them against their own years or long history of revolutionary struggle. For example, the Second and Sixth Districts of Renqiu felt that there were no people who could be promoted. After some counties corrected this, they developed the problem of promoting cadres without principle or according to the standards of "virtue, ability, and experience" in order to meet numerical targets, and even falsifying resumes to cope with the superiors. For example, a certain district of Jianguo falsely claimed that a militiaman was a party member and sent him to the Party School. Third, some counties did not actively and systematically cultivate and promote cadres, but only wanted to rely on the higher authorities to send cadres. Due to incorrect views, deviations also occurred in the methods of mobilization. Some were promoted simply through training courses without being tested at work and then receiving short-term training; others adopted deceptive and coercive methods, such as saying during mobilization, "If you leave home, your family will be provided for." Some indulged in tailism, accommodated the backwardness of those being mobilized, and abandoned leadership. Some district committees in Qingcangjiao did not punish or educate village cadres who repeatedly refused and ran away, but allowed them to return to work in the village, fostering a state of disorganization and indiscipline among village cadres and party members. In this mobilization, it can be seen that the party organizations in some county districts and villages are not yet sound enough, and party members and cadres have many weaknesses in their grasp of policy principles, political cultivation, party spirit training, and work style. First, they do not delve deeply into their work on a regular basis, and they do not cultivate cadres well in their work, improve their quality, and regard it as one of the party's regular tasks and an important part of party building. Second, discovering active elements and cultivating and improving the quality of cadres is a long-term, meticulous organizational education work that must be carried out in an organized and planned manner with basic party knowledge and class education. Third, in cultivating and improving party members and cadres, emphasis should be placed on those with development prospects.

　　应该如何培养与提拔干部
  　冀中八地委总结经验
    【冀中电】八地委在十、十一、十二三个月中培养提拔分区、县区级干部一千八百零六名，九月底，八分区按旧编制统计，共缺少县主要干部三十八名，一般干部一百七十七名，区主要干部三百五十名，一般干部二百四十八名。十二月底，按新编制统计：已补上县主要干部四十二名，一般干部五百七十二名，区主要干部二百四十六名，一般干部九百四十六名。获得以上成绩的原因：第一、使县区干部认识了在新形势下培养提拔干部的重要意义；第二、有计划的在工作中考验与教育被提拔的干部对象；第三、带徒弟方式与召开短期训练班，是由村干部提拔成区干部的最好最快的办法；第四、领导上要抓紧自上而下的督促检查。在执行中，有的干部对新形势下培养提拔干部与“干部决定一切”的政治意义认识不够，便发生了单纯完成任务的观点。表现在被提拔的干部，有的不是出身纯正、作风正派、经过群众考验，为群众拥护的积极分子。如河间三区提拔了一个曾任国民党军队副官又和日寇汉奸勾结、破坏人民利益的分子为区助理员。交河十区提拔了一个经我政府判处徒刑尚未满期的人。第二、有的干部对提拔对象要求过高，以自己几年或长期革命斗争历史去衡量，如任邱二、六区感觉没有可提拔的人。有的县份纠正后，却发生了无原则、不根据“德才资”的标准，为满足数目字而提拔干部的毛病，甚至应付上级伪造履历。如建国某区把一个民兵捏称党员送入党校。第三、有的县份不是主动的有计划的培养提拔干部，只想依赖上级派来干部。由于观点不正确，在动员的方式方法上也发生了偏向。有的不是经过工作考验，再经短期训练，而是单纯经过训练班提拔；有的是采取欺骗强制的办法，如有的动员时说：“你离家可供给你家中吃的。”有的尾巴主义迁就被动员者的落后性，放弃领导；青沧交有的区委对多次拒绝而逃跑的村干部，不给予处分教育使其仍回村工作，助长了村干部党员的无组织无纪律状态。在此次动员中，可以看出：有些县的区、村党的组织还不够健全，党员干部政策原则的掌握，政治修养，党性锻炼，工作作风上还有不少的弱点。第一、平时工作不深入，不会很好的在工作中培养干部，提高其质量，并作为党的经常任务之一，作为建党的重要部分。第二、发现积极分子，培养与提高干部质量，是长期的细密的组织教育工作，必须有组织有计划地进行党的基本知识和阶级教育。第三、培养提高党员干部，应着重有发展前途的。
