　　Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 18th: TASS, Moscow reports: The General Assembly of the Soviet Geographical Society, held here on February 10th, passed a resolution on the Antarctic issue, protesting that certain countries are conducting behind-the-scenes negotiations on the Antarctic issue without Soviet participation. The resolution declares: Any solution to the Antarctic issue reached without Soviet participation is legally invalid, and the Soviet Union has every reason not to recognize it.

　　Lev Berg, Chairman of the Soviet Geographical Society and a member of the Academy of Sciences, pointed out in his report to the General Assembly of the Geographical Society: Antarctica has an area larger than Europe and contains valuable raw materials such as coal, gold, silver, lead, and iron. It has been suggested that there may also be uranium deposits there. Several countries (including the Soviet Union) are conducting large-scale whaling and seal hunting in the Antarctic seas. At the same time, the air route through Antarctica is the shortest route connecting the three populated continents of the Southern Hemisphere - Africa, Australia, and South America. Russian explorers Bellingshausen and Lazarev proved in 1820 that the then-popular idea that there was no land outside the Antarctic Circle was false, and discovered the existence of land in Antarctica. Historically, Russia and its successor, the Soviet Union, still retain territorial rights to some of the discovered land in Antarctica. Russia has never given up its rights, and the Soviet government has never agreed to anyone governing the land discovered by Russian sailors.

　　某些国家幕后谈判南极问题
  　苏联地理学会提出抗议           
    没有苏联参加的协议均无法律效力
    【新华社陕北十八日电】据塔斯社莫斯科讯：二月十日在此间举行的苏联地理学会大会，通过一项关于南极问题的决议，抗议某些国家在没有苏联参加的情况下，正在幕后进行关于南极问题的谈判。决议宣称：一切没有苏联参加而达成的关于南极问题的解决，都没有法律效力，苏联有一切理由不予承认。
    苏联地理学会主席、科学院会员列夫·贝尔格，曾在地理学会大会上作报告时指出：南极洲的面积超过欧洲，它蕴藏着煤、金、银、铅与铁之类极有价值的原料。有人表示那里或许还有铀矿。若干国家（包括苏联在内）都在南极海中大规模地进行捕鲸与捕海豹。同时，经过南极的航空路线，是把南半球三个有居民的大洲——非洲、澳洲、南美洲——连接起来的最短的路线。俄罗斯探险家贝林绍森和拉萨列夫在一八二○年便证明了当时流行的认为南极圈外没有陆地的观念是虚妄不实的，而且发现了南极有陆地存在。从历史上说，俄国及其后继者苏联，仍保有对南极若干被发现的土地的领土权利。俄国从来没有放弃它的权利，而且苏维埃政府也从来没有同意任何人统辖俄罗斯海员所发现的土地。
