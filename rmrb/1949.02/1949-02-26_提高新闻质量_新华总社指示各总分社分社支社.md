To improve news quality,
Xinhua News Agency directs general, branch, and sub-branches

　　Recent submissions from various regions have shown some progress, most notably: general submissions pay attention to providing factual material, empty rhetoric has decreased, reports on workers' lives and industrial and mining construction have increased compared to the past, and military news propaganda has gradually broadened; some branch offices are sometimes able to provide news with more profound guiding significance. However, on the other hand, many submissions are lengthy in text but trivial in content, while fresh, lively, and organized news is too scarce. On average, the head office often cannot use half of the submissions daily. This is a significant waste of manpower and resources, indicating that news quality urgently needs to be improved. Therefore, we are putting forward the following opinions regarding news reporting in various regions:

　　Should have a global and comprehensive perspective
　　Suitable for the needs of readers nationwide

　　(1) When sending submissions to the head office, all regions should have a global and comprehensive perspective. It is necessary to plan, write, and select submissions from the perspective of the needs of newspaper readers nationwide and the needs of actual struggles, rather than merely based on the subjective wishes of the local area, the military unit, or the reporter. For example, when reporting a piece of news in the Northeast, one should consider whether readers in Shaanxi and Zhengzhou, as well as readers in other regions, can understand it? Is it necessary to read this news? What kind of interest and feelings will reading this news evoke? Considering these questions is the basis for news reporters to decide whether to report this news to the head office, that is, to readers among the people nationwide, and how to report this news. If these issues are not considered and a report is sent to the head office, it is a blind or subjective report. This kind of reporting is a basic shortcoming in current news work. News reports must respect the opinions of local or military unit leadership organs, and must grasp the specific situation and development of events at that time and place, but first, they must adapt to the nature and capabilities of the head office to broadcast nationwide. Today, the objects of the head office's broadcasts are newspapers and radio stations in vast areas across the country, including many newly liberated cities and rural areas. Readers and listeners in these places have little interest in and cannot understand things that are too small and trivial that are not local, and there is no need to understand them. Therefore, purely local and regional events, which are deemed to have no or little significance for readers nationwide and actual struggles, can be sent less or not at all, or reported incidentally after being adapted, compressed, and connected with other events. It is absolutely not allowed to send news from local newspapers or military unit newspapers to the head office in its original form. It should be understood here that there should be a division of labor between local newspapers and the central agency news. For example, some news about local meetings, because they are connected with the lives of the local people and are of great interest to local readers, need to be published continuously every day in local newspapers, but for the head office, it is only necessary to send one or two reports, or even not at all, because readers in other places do not need to know the details of this meeting. Some heroic and exemplary deeds of military units or civilians, if they are not universal typical examples with the value of being promoted nationwide, it is enough to praise them in local or military unit newspapers, and there is no need to send them to the head office. Some work plans, summaries, or experiences, or those that the head office has repeatedly introduced in the past, are not new inventions in the country, or are not mature and lack universal significance, or only individual experiences are new discoveries, should not be sent at all, or only excerpts of new things should be sent, or only to prove the experience of other places. In this way, some of our submissions can be greatly streamlined, the quality of news will be improved, and the propaganda effect will be much better.

　　Should have a clear purpose
　　Explain problems and solve problems

　　(2) The news sent to the head office should have a clear purpose, and its effects and functions should be anticipated in advance. In addition to some brief news reports of major events that readers across the country should know (such as our army occupying a certain city on a certain day), more submissions—especially long submissions—need to explain certain issues, and it is best to further solve certain issues. When reporting a piece of news, it is necessary to explain the time, place, social background, various objective and subjective conditions, the twists and turns of historical development, its relationship with other things or other aspects, its own characteristics, its position in the overall situation, and its role. What role does it play and what direction will it develop in the future? In this way, news can truly reflect things, be vivid, and attract readers' attention and interest. However, many of our news items often fail to do so, often adopting a metaphysical reporting method, forcibly piecing together many isolated, fragmented, and unrelated phenomena and figures under a so-called "lead." The introduction of these phenomena or figures is often not related to the overall thing or movement, nor is there a process of change and development. As a result, many news reports have no difference between new and old areas, and little difference between large and small cities. The situation of comforting the People's Liberation Army and giving preferential treatment to military families during this year's Spring Festival is similar to that of previous years. The political work, logistics work, sanitation work, and support-the-front work of this battle unit are the same as those of that battle. The only differences are the names of places, people, and numbers. In this way, many news items have no characteristics, cannot give people clear concepts and specific images, and cannot explain and solve certain problems. The value of news does not lie in quantity, length, or the enumeration of many fragmented and superficial phenomena and examples, but in its ability to reflect the general situation of things and movements and play a certain educational and guiding role in the actual social struggle. Excessive and tedious enumeration of phenomena not only cannot achieve this goal, but also makes many readers unwilling to read on after seeing the so-called "lead" (many leads are often repetitive). We must always care about the relationship between our works and readers and the revolutionary struggle. When writing news, we should first analyze and study the collected materials in connection with the actual struggle, so that we have a clear purpose in our thinking, and then adopt a method of combining individual things with general situations, comparing them with each other, and drawing inferences from one example.

　　Must expand the scope of reporting
　　Continuous reporting from beginning to end

　　(3) We must expand the scope of reporting and continuously report on the development process of things from beginning to end to make our news content richer. At present, our news reporting area is relatively narrow, and often an event only has a beginning, without a process of change and development and its results. After the liberation of many cities, the focus of reporting gradually shifted to cities, which is appropriate. However, the lives and actual movements of rural people should continue to be introduced, especially what impact the liberation of many cities has had on rural areas and farmers should be reflected. Many places announced agricultural production plans and loan figures more than a month ago, and we should continue to report on their implementation and results, and don’t just have spring arrangements and mobilizations, like in previous years, and no autumn harvests and summaries. Urban news reports should not be limited to issuing entry orders, taking over institutions and enterprises, and restoring industry and commerce, which were lively for a month or two at the time of entry. Such as how to systematically destroy the reactionary rule of the Kuomintang, how the people are organized, and how to establish people's democratic rule, how to run municipal construction and public welfare undertakings related to the lives of urban people; how to transform from a consumer city to a production city; how to gradually transform school education; how to closely connect urban and rural relations, so that cities serve citizens, farmers, and the liberation war; what problems our cadres have in terms of thinking, life, and style after entering the city and how to solve them should be continuously reported, so that we can reflect the complex situation and problems of cities, the new and old struggles in cities, the process of transformation from semi-colonial cities to new democratic cities, and the growth and development of new people's cities. Both cities and rural areas should expand the scope of reporting, and reporting on larger events or movements should be continuous from beginning to end, and be good at combining timely and continuous reporting with regular and comprehensive reporting. Now the Party has a system of comprehensive reports, and cities with more than 50,000 people have regular special reports. The general branches, branch offices, and sub-branches should be good at using the materials of these reports to discover news clues, help themselves analyze and study problems, and conduct systematic reports.

　　In addition, timely and brief reporting is also one of the fundamental issues. It is closely related to the above three items and has been discussed in another telegram. I hope we can study it together.

　　Regularly summarize the submission work
　　Constantly check and seek improvement

　　In order to improve our work, the general branches, branch offices, and sub-branches should summarize their news reports every two months. In the summary, we should especially study the submission work to the head office, including what news was reported this month, what should have been reported but was not reported? Among the news that has been reported, which is valuable, which is not valuable, or has little value? Which of them has the head office adopted, and which has not been broadcast? Is it right or wrong not to adopt it, and what is the reason? Among the news that has been broadcast, which has been modified, is the modification good or not, and what is the reason? Based on the situation of your own submissions and the head office's adoption in these two months, how should you do it in the future to better adapt to the requirements of the head office? Such a summary does not need to be too long, just focus on one or several key issues each time and write about a thousand words. This summary should be sent to the head office before the 10th of every even month, so that the work of the branch offices can be continuously improved, and the head office can also check and improve its own work and conduct business guidance more correctly based on the summary of the branch offices.

### 提高新闻质量　新华总社指示各总分社分社支社

专栏：

　　提高新闻质量
  　新华总社指示各总分社分社支社
    最近各地来稿都有若干进步，其中比较显著的是：一般稿件都能注意提供事实材料，空头议论减少，对于工人生活和工矿建设的报导比过去增多，在军事新闻宣传方面逐渐宽广；某些分社有时能够供给具有较深刻指导作用的新闻。但另一方面，许多稿件文字较长而内容较琐碎，而新鲜的、生动的、有条理的新闻则太少，总社每日平均常有半数稿件无法采用。这是一种很大的人力物力的浪费。这说明新闻质量亟需提高。因此，我们特对各地新闻报道，提出下列意见：
  　应有全局全面的观点
    适合全国读者的需要
    （一）各地在向总社发稿时，应有全局的、全面的观点。必须从全国范围报纸读者的需要和实际斗争的需要，来有计划地采写和选择稿件，而不要仅仅根据当地或本部队或记者的主观愿望。举例说，在东北报道一条新闻，就要设想陕北和郑州的读者，以及其他各地的读者，是否能够看懂？是否有必要看这条新闻？看这条新闻后会引起何种兴趣和感想？这些问题的考虑是新闻报道者决定是否向总社，亦即向全国人民中的读者报道这条新闻，以及如何报道这条新闻的根据。如果不考虑到这些问题，就向总社报导，那就是一种盲目的或主观的报导。这种报导是目前新闻工作中一个基本缺点。新闻报导必须尊重当地或本部队领导机关的意见，并一定要把握当时当地的具体情况和事变发展，但首先要适应总社向全国广播的性质和能力。今天总社广播的供给对象，是全国广大地区的报纸和广播台，其中包括许多新解放的城市和农村的报纸和广播台，这些地方的读者和听众，对于其他地方的而不是本地的太过细小，太过琐碎的事情，是很少兴趣的和不能了解的，而且也没有必要去了解的。因此，纯粹局部性的、地域性的事件，占计对于全国读者和实际斗争没有意义或很少作用的，可以不发或少发，或经过改编压缩并联系其他事件的新闻附带地报导，决不能把地方报或部队报上的新闻都原封原样地发来。这里应该了解到：地方报和中央机关通讯社，应该有的分工。比如，有些地方性的会议的新闻，因为与当地人民群众生活有联系，为当地读者深感兴趣者，在当地报纸就有天天连续发表的必要，但对总社则只需发一二次，有的甚至根本不必发，因为其他地方的读者没有必要去知道这次会议的详情。有些部队或民间的英勇和模范事迹，如果不是带有普遍性的典型，有向全国宣传的价值者，只要在当地或部队报纸表扬就够，则不必发给总社。有些工作计划、总结或经验，或者总社过去已经一再介绍过了，在全国说来并不是新发明，或者本身并不成熟缺乏普遍意义，或者其中只有个别经验是新发现的，就应该根本不发，或只摘发其中新的东西，或只证明其他地方的经验。这样，我们有些稿件就可大大地精简，新闻质量就会提高，宣传效果也会要好得多。
    应有明确的目的性
    说明问题解决问题
    （二）发给总社的新闻应该有明确的目的性，预先设想到它的效果和作用。除了若干简要的，全国读者都应知道的重大事件的消息报导（例如我军某日占领某个城市）而外，更多的稿件——尤其是长稿——需要说明一定的问题，最好进而做到解决一定的问题，在报导一件新闻的时候，要说明这件事物产生的时间、地点、社会背景，诸般客观和主观的条件，历史发展的曲折过程，它和其他事物或其他方面的关系，本身有何特色，在全局中占着怎样的地位和起着怎样的作用，占计将向什么方向发展等等。这样，新闻才能真正反映事物，有血有肉，吸引读者的注意和兴趣。但目前我们许多新闻往往不能如此，往往采取了一种形而上学的报道方法，在一个所谓“导语”的大帽子之下，把许多孤立的、零碎的、互不相关的现象和数字，勉强拼凑在一起。对于这些现象或数字的介绍，往往不与全般事物或运动发生联系，也没有一个变化发展的过程。于是许多新闻的报道，新区的和老区的没有差别，大城市的和小城市的很少出入，今年春节的慰劳解放军和优待军属的情形和往年的相仿佛，这个战役部队的政治工作、后勤工作、卫生工作、支援前线工作和那个战役的一样。所不同的，只是换了几个地名、人名和数目字。这样，有许多新闻就没有特色，不能给人明晰的概念和具体的形象，不能说明和解决一定的问题。新闻的价值不在乎多，不在乎长，不在乎罗列许多零碎的、表面的现象和事例，而在于能反映事物和运动的一般状况，对于社会实际斗争起一定的教育和指导作用。过分烦琐的现象罗列不但不能达到这个目的，反而使许多读者在一看到所谓“导语”（许多导语也常常是重复的）以后就不愿再读下去。我们要时刻关心自己的作品对于读者和革命斗争的关系，在写作新闻时，应该首先将收集到的材料和实际斗争联系着进行分析研究，使思想上有明确的目的，然后采取个别事物和一般情况相结合，相互类比，举一反三的方法进行报导。
    必须扩大报道范围
    连续报道有始有终
    （三）必须扩大报导范围，并依据事物的发展进程有始有终地连续的报道，使我们的新闻内容更加丰富。目前我们的新闻报道面积比较狭窄，而且一件事往往只有一个开端，没有变化发展过程及其结果。在解放了许多城市以后，报道重心逐渐转向城市，这是应该的。但农村人民的生活和实际运动，仍应继续介绍，特别是许多城市的解放对于农村和农民起了一些什么影响，应该有所反映。许多地方一个多月前发表了农业生产计划和贷款数字，就应继续报道它的执行情形和结果，不要如往年那样只有春天的布置和动员，没有秋天的收获和总结。城市新闻的报道，不要只局限于发布入城命令，接管机关企业，恢复工商业，在入城当时热闹一两个月。诸如如何系统地摧毁国民党反动统治，人民如何组织起来，并如何建立人民民主统治，如何兴办与城市人民生活有关的市政建设和公益事业；如何由消费城市转变为生产城市；如何逐渐的改造学校教育；如何密切城乡关系，使城市为市民、农民和解放战争服务，我们干部在入城后思想上、生活上、作风上有何问题并如何解决的，都应进行连续的报道，使能反映出城市的复杂情况和问题，城市中新和旧的斗争、半殖民地城市向新民主主义城市的脱胎换骨的变化过程，以及新的人民的城市成长发展的经过。无论城市和农村都应扩大报道范围，对于较大事件或运动的报道都应有始有终，并且要善于把及时的、连续的报道和定期的、综合的报道结合着进行。现在党内规定有综合报告制度，五万人口以上的城市又有定期的专门报告，各总分社、分社、支社，要善于利用这些报告的材料，来发现新闻线索，帮助自己分析研究问题，并进行有系统的报道。
    此外，报道应该及时和简短，也是根本问题之一。与上述三项有密切关系，已于另电谈及，希结合着一同研究。
    定期总结发稿工作
    不断检查求得改进
    为了改进我们的工作，各总分社、分社、支社应该对于自己的新闻报道，每两个月作一次总结。在总结中，应特别研究对总社的发稿工作，其中包括这个月报道了哪些新闻，还有那些应该报道而没有报道？已经报道的新闻中，哪些有价值、哪些没有价值、或很少价值？那些总社已经采用，那些没有广播，不采用对不对，原因何在？已经广播的新闻中，那些有了修改，修改得好不好，原因何在？根据这两个月自己发稿和总社采用情形，以后应如何做法，才能更适应总社的要求？这样的总结不必太长，每次只要抓住一个或几个关节问题，写千字左右即可。这个总结，应于每双月十日以前发来总社，以便分社工作既能不断地改进，总社也可依据分社的总结来检查和改进本身工作并更正确的进行业务指导。
