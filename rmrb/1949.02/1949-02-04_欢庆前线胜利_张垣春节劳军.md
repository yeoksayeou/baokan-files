　　Celebrating Frontline Victory
  　Zhangjiakou Spring Festival慰劳 (comforting the troops)
    [Zhangjiakou Electric] The people of Zhangjiakou celebrated their liberation and enthusiastically launched a Spring Festival movement to慰劳 (comfort) the troops. From January 20th, when the city's Support the Front Committee issued a notice calling for Spring Festival慰劳 (comforting) the troops, until the evening of the 24th, in five days, 78,400 catties of pork, beef, and mutton, 5,000 catties of white wine, more than 18,000 pieces of tofu and dried tofu, 10,000 catties of vermicelli, 30,000 catties of biscuits, more than 10,000慰问 bags, more than 70,000 yuan in Renminbi, and more than 10,000慰问 letters were received. The Water Company convened a meeting of all employees on the morning of the 20th, elected and organized a慰问 delegation, and by 12:00 noon, all employees had donated a large number of慰劳 products, including 20 packs of Swan brand cigarettes, 85 towels, 64 toothbrushes, 84 tubes of toothpaste, 85 pairs of socks, and 10 catties of biscuits. In addition, everyone made a慰问 bag. Some employees of the PingSui Railway Transportation Section prepared to eat one less catty of meat during the New Year to慰劳 (comfort) the troops; others took out one-fifth of their monthly salary to慰劳 (comfort) the troops. When discussing慰劳 (comforting) the troops, the Zhangjiakou Police Station of the PingSui Railway decided to protect the safety of the railway to ensure smooth military transport, and to support the front with practical work. The front and rear should be united, the attitude should be good, and they should help the comrades in the troops when they get off the train. Wu Jun, a barber in the Second District, said: "When the Chiang Kai-shek bandits were in power, haircuts were not free; now that we are liberated, the workers have gained freedom!" More than 20 barbers unanimously proposed to give good慰劳 to the frontline soldiers to show their enthusiasm. The members of the Support the Front Committee of the Municipal Chamber of Commerce were also busy all day, and浄慰劳 (just comforting) provided 70,000 catties of pork, mutton, and beef, 10,000 catties of vermicelli, more than 18,000 pieces of tofu and dried tofu, 30,000 catties of biscuits, 5,000 catties of wine, and 3,600慰问 bags. The Tofu Industry Association automatically reduced the price of tofu sold to慰劳 (comfort) the army by 2角 (jiao) per piece and guaranteed that the pieces were not small. The Wine Industry Association guaranteed the quality of the wine, did not adulterate it, and did not add water. Those who slaughtered pigs and sheep guaranteed that it was done cleanly. The teachers and students of Zhangjiakou Women's Normal School sewed 20 large慰问 bags with various colored cloths, filled with towels, soaps, toothpastes, toothbrushes, etc. This time, the Zhangjiakou 市慰问 bags were very full and exquisitely made, embroidered with various poems or songs, expressing the people's praise, love, and hope for the People's Liberation Army, and also expressing their anger and hatred towards the Chiang Kai-shek bandit gang. Some wrote: "Singing the cheers of victory, we will plant our flag on the Qianmen Tower in Beiping. We will advance into Jiangnan and plant the red flag on Nanjing City so that the people who have been ravaged by the Chiang Kai-shek bandit gang for a long time can be liberated." "You charge, I charge, capture more prisoners and make more contributions. Only by liberating all of China can we enjoy peace." "The bald man's head is shiny and bright, his name is Chiang Kai-shek. Overthrowing the bald man means having food to eat, overthrowing the bald man means seeking liberation." In order to deliver these gifts and hopes of the people to the People's Liberation Army on the front line, representatives from all walks of life organized the Zhangjiakou City各界慰劳团 (Comfort Delegation) on the 24th, and set off for the Beiping front line on the morning of January 25th with a large number of慰劳 products.
