　　Guarantee the Development of Agricultural Cooperatives
    Exceeding the Predetermined Plan by More Than Double
    [Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 31st] TASS, Sofia: New agricultural cooperatives are being established in Bulgarian villages one after another. The establishment of new agricultural cooperatives is primarily due to the production achievements of the cooperatives themselves. Last year, the harvest of these cooperatives was 20 to 25 percent higher than that of individual farms. Secondly, it is due to the extensive assistance provided by the state to agricultural cooperatives. In 1948, the development of agricultural cooperatives completed and exceeded the predetermined plan by more than double. Currently, there are a total of 1,114 agricultural cooperatives nationwide, with 75,000 members and over 300,000 hectares of cultivated land. Note: As of the beginning of July 1948, there were only 686 agricultural cooperatives in Bulgaria, with 48,000 members and over 200,000 hectares of cultivated land. At that time, agricultural cooperatives already used 354 tractors, 237 threshing machines, and 256 sheaf binders. Due to the use of machinery and advanced agricultural technology, the yield of land managed by agricultural cooperatives has greatly exceeded that of land managed by individual farmers.

　　保农业合作社发展
    超过预定计划一倍以上
    【新华社陕北三十一日电】塔斯社索非亚讯：保加利亚农村纷纷成立新的农业合作社。新农业合作社的所以成立，首先由于合作社的生产成就。去年，这种合作社的收获量较个体农场的收获量多百分之二十到二十五。其次是由于国家给予农业合作社的广泛帮助。一九四八年，农业合作社的发展，完成并超过预定计划一倍以上。现在，全国共有一千一百一十四个农业合作社，这些合作社拥有七万五千社员和三十万公顷以上的耕地。按：在一九四八年七月初，保加利亚全国还只有六百八十六个农业合作社，拥有四万八千社员和二十万公顷以上的耕地。当时，农业合作社使用的拖拉机已有三五四架，打谷机有二三七架，束禾机有二五六架。由于运用机器和先进的农业技术，农业合作社经营土地的收成，已大大超过个体农民经营的土地。
