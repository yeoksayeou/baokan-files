　　Buried Talent Given Free Rein

　　A person whose enthusiasm for work has become stagnant rapidly revives this enthusiasm once they come into contact with the warmth of the new society.

　　Liu Huiging, an electrician at the Jiawang Power Plant in Tongshan County, Jiangsu Province, is thirty-seven years old this year. He began learning electrical work at the age of sixteen and has worked as an electrician in Fushun, Jinzhou, Benxi, Beiping, Datong, and other places for more than ten years. After the Japanese surrender, he came to the Jiawang Coal Mine as an electrician. During his more than twenty years of electrical work, he accumulated rich experience, and he is an expert in repairing all aspects of electrical appliances, whether internal or external wiring. However, in the old society, his skills were never valued. After coming to Jiawang, not only was he not given important responsibilities, but he was also squeezed out everywhere, and his monthly salary averaged only a little more than two bags of flour, making it difficult for his whole family to make ends meet. Under such circumstances, Liu Huiging's work enthusiasm suffered a setback, and he harbored the idea of "don't show off your abilities" all day long.

　　In the past, when electric motors broke down or had problems, they had to be sent to Shanghai for repair. Each repair cost hundreds of millions of yuan in round-trip transportation and repair fees per motor. After the Japanese surrender, when the Kuomintang took over, an electric motor of twenty horsepower broke down. When Liu Huiging discussed with the mine management how to repair it, the answer he received was: "No one in the factory can repair it, so it's better to send it to Shanghai." As a result, Liu Huiging dared not and did not want to say that he could repair it himself. Until before liberation, the power plant only knew that Liu Huiging could repair external wiring, and no one knew that he was also good at repairing internal wiring of electrical appliances.

　　After Jiawang was liberated, under the leadership of the Communist Party, the workers' lives were guaranteed, and in their work, the workers' enthusiasm and creativity were inspired and supported everywhere. At this time, Liu Huiging realized that the time had come for him to truly work for society. Soon, two one-horsepower electric motors malfunctioned and could not be used. Liu Huiging automatically proposed a trial repair. After he dismantled and repaired them thoroughly, the two electric motors quickly found the problem and were repaired as good as new. From then on, Liu Huiging's skills immediately attracted the attention of the workers and the mine management. Subsequently, with the encouragement of the mine management and the assistance of the repair workers, he began to repair another thirty-odd horsepower electric motor that had been broken for three or four years. He collected insulating paper, mica, yellow cloth, etc. left over in the mine, disassembled the entire electric motor, re-wrapped the wires, and repaired it. After nearly a month of effort, he finally repaired the electric motor that had been sitting idle for three or four years before the Lunar New Year. The original rated speed of the electric motor was 1,450 revolutions per minute. After the repair, the test results showed that the mark on the speedometer pointed to exactly 1,450 revolutions per minute. When people praised Liu Huiging's success, he humbly said: "In the past, because the environment was different, people didn't need us, and we didn't want to show our abilities. Today, we are happy in spirit, and everyone is working for the people, so of course I am willing to do my best!"

　　被埋没的才能得到了发挥
    一个对事业的热情已经僵冷了的人，在他一旦接触到了新社会的温暖的时候，这种热情便又迅速地复苏起来。
    江苏铜山县贾汪发电厂的电工刘辉卿，今年三十七岁。他从十六岁就学电工，曾在抚顺、锦州、本溪、北平、大同等地做电工十数年。日寇投降后，又来到贾汪煤矿做电工。二十余年的电工生活，他积累了丰富的经验，在电器方面不管内线、外线的修理全是内行。但是，在旧社会里，他的技术，始终没被人重视。他来贾汪后，不惟不被重用，反处处受排挤，每月平均只能拿到两袋多面的工资，全家简直难以糊口。在这样的情况下，就使刘辉卿的事业情绪，遭受了挫折，终日抱着“不要逞能”的思想。
    过去电滚坏了或出了毛病时，非送到上海修理不行，修一次所用的往返运费、修理费，每个马达要数亿元。日寇投降后，国民党接管时，曾有一个二十匹马力的电滚坏了，当刘辉卿和矿方商讨如何修理时，得到的回答是：“厂里没有人能修，送到上海去好了。”于是，刘辉卿再也不敢也不愿说自己能修理了。直到解放前为止，发电所里只知道刘辉卿能修外线，并没人知道他还擅长电器内线的修理。
    贾汪解放后，在共产党领导下，工人的生活有了保障，在工作中又处处启发和扶植工人的积极性和创造性，这时，刘辉卿认识到是他真正为社会做事的时机到来了。不久，两个各一匹马力的电滚出毛病不能用了，刘辉卿便自动提议试修，经过他大拆整修，两个电滚很快找出了毛病，修好后和新的一样可用。从此刘辉卿的技术立即引起了工人和矿方的注意。接着，又在矿方的鼓励及修理工人的协助下，开始修理坏了三、四年的另一个三十余匹马力的电滚。他搜集了矿中遗存的绝缘纸、云母、黄包布等，将该电滚全部拆卸，重新包线整修，经过将近一个月的努力，终于在旧历年前把这摆了三四年的电滚修好了。该电滚原定转速每分钟有一千四百五十滚，经修好后试验的结果，一分钟内在计速仪上指着的标志正是一千四百五十速。当人们赞誉着刘辉卿的成功时，他谦逊的说：“过去因环境不同，人家不用咱，咱也不愿显能干，今天咱精神上痛快，而且大家都是为人民，当然自己乐意尽力干了！”
