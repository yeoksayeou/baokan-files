Since the Daoqing Campaign in late October last year in Taihang, the Qinhe Sub-district (formerly the Fourth Sub-district) liberated vast areas covering the counties of Jiaozuo, Xiuwu, Wuzhi, and Huojia, with a population of over 400,000. However, the remaining enemy and puppet armed forces still existed in concealment, disrupting social order and seriously endangering the interests of the masses. After more than two months of mobilizing the masses to suppress bandits, work in the new area began to develop. By mid-January of this year, the bandit suppression work in the Yubei New Area was largely completed, and the following experiences were initially explored.

First, strengthening organizational discipline, correcting cadres' political thinking, and timely correcting mistakes have become the basic key to the successful completion of bandit suppression work. First of all, because each county has consistently carried out the propaganda and education of bandit suppression policies from the beginning, understood the historical lessons, and armed cadres and the masses with political thinking, most areas have correctly implemented the general policy of "thoroughly suppressing bandits" and the specific policy of lenient treatment, thus achieving the success of suppressing bandits without losing a single person or firing a single shot. At the same time, the leadership promptly and resolutely corrected certain deviations in the implementation of policies, carried out the struggle between two lines, and improved the political thinking of cadres, which further promoted the bandit suppression work. On the one hand, it timely discovered and corrected the retaliatory emotions of a few cadres who resisted the lenient policy, as well as the leftist and reckless phenomena of simply engaging in weapons acquisition, indiscriminate beatings, deductions, forced confessions, indiscriminate punishments, and indiscriminate confiscation of property; on the other hand, it addressed the rightist phenomena of not daring to expose the crimes of enemy and puppet personnel, and of not exposing, suppressing, or punishing certain criminal acts of enemy and puppet personnel according to law. Secondly, most cadres and activists had serious thoughts of peace and paralysis at the beginning of the bandit suppression movement, and underestimated the remaining bandits, eager to carry out land reform. Therefore, on the one hand, the rightist thinking of peace and paralysis was emphasized, and at the same time, the leftist thinking of radical retaliation was strictly prevented. After the movement was launched and gradually deepened, it was found that many cadres and activists had the idea of exaggerating the enemy's strength, such as "there are too many remaining bandits" and "the work is very incomplete." At this time, the leftist ideological bias of "expansionism" was emphasized, and at the same time, the rightist thinking of not being vigilant against a very small number of reactionary elements was prevented. Because the two-line struggle of "anti-rightist and prevention of leftism" or "anti-leftist and prevention of rightism" has always been implemented, the bandit suppression movement has developed normally and completed quickly.

Second, systematically, deeply, and extensively mobilizing the masses, and closely combining with administrative power, is the basic line of bandit suppression work. The experience of more than two months has proved that it is impossible to suppress the remaining bandits in one go. From late October to the end of November last year, the administrative power was mainly combined with mobilizing the masses to participate, initially opening up the situation of bandit suppression. To this end, various places held large meetings and various symposiums with a total of 150,000 people participating, publicizing current affairs and policies, calling on the masses to assist the government and the army in suppressing bandits, and at the same time vigorously calling on and mobilizing enemy military personnel and their families to strive for enemy military personnel to register and repent and hand over weapons. After the beginning of December, it began to shift to mainly relying on in-depth mobilization of the masses to suppress bandits, combined with administrative power, so as to further suppress the hidden bandits and disarm them, completely and thoroughly suppress the bandits, and establish and consolidate the democratic order. To this end, the basic link is to awaken the masses' awareness of bandit suppression, establish the ideological basis for bandit suppression policies, and deeply develop a mass bandit suppression movement. Mobilize on a large scale from top to bottom. Jiaozuo, Xiuwu, Wuzhi, and Huojia counties separately held a large mobilization of more than 4,000 new district village cadres, followed by the convening of more than 200,000 people's celebration and bandit suppression mobilization meetings led by districts or joint defense, further enabling the masses to understand the situation of victory in about a year and our party's bandit suppression policies, and constantly combined with the masses' thinking to repeatedly publicize education, eliminate their "change of dynasty" concerns, improve class awareness, and establish their determination to suppress bandits. Secondly, it is necessary to cultivate and use a large number of activists to further mobilize and organize armed masses, and to carry out an organized bandit suppression movement with substance. Each county adopted the method of intensively training poor and honest farmers or holding small mass grievance meetings to cultivate activists. Wuzhi successively conducted thirteen short-term intensive trainings with districts as units, and emerged with more than 3,000 activists. Fifty-three villages in Jiaozuo discovered 686 awakened activists by holding small mass grievance meetings. In the intensive training, the methods of speaking about current affairs, expressing thoughts, complaining, and educating on policies and styles were generally adopted, studying the situation of the remaining bandits, organizing them, and making step-by-step ideological mobilization, so that the activists not only had class awareness, but also had preliminary policy consciousness. Then, relying on activists to extensively contact the masses, individually collude to gradually organize and arm themselves, and set off a mass survey of the remaining enemies, persuading and warning them to register and hand in their guns or report them secretly. Xiuwu Chengguan mobilized the masses to clear out 50 hidden bandits, and some places even launched small-scale reasoning struggles to promote their law-abiding behavior. However, we must never neglect to continue to give full play to administrative power to cooperate with the masses in suppressing bandits, and use the political power and armed forces to suppress bandits and secret service activities, giving the masses strong support.

Third, treat enemy military personnel differently, with clear rewards and punishments, and carry out disintegration and division work. Experience has proved that treating enemy military personnel in a uniform manner, or having a leftist or rightist tendency, will inevitably cause difficulties in bandit suppression. After short-term intensive training and registration of repentance, the middle and lower-level enemy military personnel recognized their sins and the future of reform. Some not only handed over their weapons, but also reported unregistered enemy military personnel and their hidden weapons; some also went to persuade and collude with other enemy military personnel to register and hand in their weapons, and actively performed meritorious service to atone for their crimes. Now the remaining bandits are increasingly approaching total disintegration, the vast majority have begun to bow their heads and transform themselves to engage in production, and a small number of upper-level counter-revolutionaries are even more isolated.

　　坚决肃清残匪是开辟新区工作的首要步骤
    豫北新区肃匪经验介绍
    端正干部思想
    及时纠正左右倾向
    深入广泛发动群众
    密切结合行政力量
    分别对待赏罚严明
    大力进行分化瓦解
    太行去年十月下旬道清战役以来，沁河分区（原四分区）解放了焦作、修武、武陟、获嘉等县四十余万人口的广大地区。但敌伪残余武装仍隐蔽存在，扰乱社会秩序，严重危害了群众利益。经两月多发动群众肃清残匪，使新区工作获得开展。至今年一月中旬，豫北新区肃匪工作已大体完成，并初步摸索到如下经验。
    第一、加强组织性纪律性，端正干部政策思想，及时纠正错误，成为肃匪工作胜利完成的基本关键。首先，各县由于自始至终进行了肃匪政策的宣传教育，领会了历史教训，以政策思想武装了干部与群众，因此大部地区均正确执行了“必须彻底肃清残匪”的总政策，与具体分别对待的宽大政策，因而获得了一人未损、一枪没打即肃清了残匪的成绩。同时，领导上及时坚决地纠正了执行政策中的某些偏向，开展了两条路线的斗争，提高了干部政策思想，进一步推动了肃匪工作，一方面及时发现与纠正了少数干部抵抗宽大政策的报复情绪，与单纯搞武器的乱打、乱扣、乱逼供、乱惩办、乱没收资财等左倾蛮干现象；另一方面，不敢揭露敌伪人员之罪恶，以及对某些敌伪人员犯罪行为不去揭发镇压、依法惩办等右倾现象。其次，大部分干部积极分子，在肃匪运动开始曾严重存在着太平麻痹思想，对残匪轻视，急于搞土地改革。因而一方面着重反对了太平麻痹的右倾思想，同时又严密防止了偏激报复的左倾思想。在运动开展以后及逐渐深入中，发现不少干部积极分子又产生了“残匪多的很”，“搞的很不彻底”等夸大敌人力量的思想。此时，即着重反对了“扩大化”的左倾思想偏向，同时亦防止了对极少数反动分子不加警惕的右倾思想。由于始终贯彻了“反右防左”或“反左防右”的两条路线斗争，致使肃匪运动获得正常发展，迅速完成。
    第二、有步骤的深入、广泛发支群众，紧密结合行政力量，是肃匪工作的基本路线。两个多月的经验证明：囫囵吞枣，一口气即想肃清残匪是不可能的。去年十月下旬至十一月底，主要以行政力量结合动员群众参加，初步打开了肃匪局面。为此，各地分别召开了共有十五万群众参加的大会及各种座谈会，宣传时事与政策，号召群众协助政府军队肃匪，并同时大力号召动员敌军人员及其家属，争取敌军人员登记悔过，缴出武器。十二月初旬以后，开始转向主要以深入发动群众肃匪，结合行政力量，这样，才能进一步肃清隐藏残匪及解除其武装，彻底完全肃匪，建立与巩固民主秩序。为此，基本一环是唤醒群众肃匪觉悟，树立肃匪政策思想，深入开展群众性的肃匪运动。自上而下，大规模动员。焦作、修武、武陟、获嘉四县分别召开了四千余新区村干部会的大动员，继即有领导有计划的以区或联防召开了二十余万人的祝捷肃匪动员大会，进一步使群众认识一年左右胜利的形势及我党肃匪政策，并不断结合群众思想反复宣传教育，解除其“变天”顾虑，提高阶级觉悟，树立肃匪决心。其次，必须培养与运用大批积极分子，进一步发动与组织武装群众，有组织的展开有骨有肉的肃匪运动。各县采用集训贫苦老实农民或召开小型群众诉苦会，培养积极分子。武陟以区为单位先后短期集训十三次，涌现积极分子三千余人。焦作五十三个村通过召开群众小型诉苦会，发现了六百八十六个觉悟的积极分子。集训中一般采用了讲时事、表心思、诉苦及政策与作风的教育，研究残匪情况，组织起来，作有步骤的思想发动，使积极分子既有阶级觉悟，又初步有政策自觉。接着，依靠积极分子广泛联系群众，个别串通逐渐组织与武装起来，掀起了群众性的调查残敌、劝说与警告其登记缴枪或检举密报。修武城关发动群众清查出隐藏残匪五十名，有的地方并展开小型说理斗争，促使其守法。但是，绝不可忽视继续充分发挥行政力量以配合群众肃匪，以政权武装镇压残匪与特务活动，给群众以有力的撑腰。
    第三、分别对待敌军人员，赏罚严明，进行瓦解与分化工作。经验证明，一律对待敌军人员与或左或右的倾向，势必造成肃匪的困难。各地经短期集训登记悔过后的中下层敌军人员，认识了自己罪恶与改造前途，有的不但缴出武器，并检举未登记的敌军人员及其隐藏武器；有的并去劝说串通其他敌军人员登记缴械，积极立功赎罪。现残匪日益接近全部瓦解，绝大部分开始低头转变进行生产，少数上层反革命分子则更加孤立。
