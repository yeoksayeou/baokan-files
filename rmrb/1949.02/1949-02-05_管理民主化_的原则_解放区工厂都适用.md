　　The Principle of "Democratic Management"

　　To the Editor:

　　When we were studying the Labor Representative Conference's "Resolution on the Current Tasks of the Chinese Workers' Movement," we had some disputes regarding the principle of "democratic management" in Chapter 3, Section 4. Some said that the slogan of democratic management is suitable for the Northeast because it is a newly liberated area. It is not suitable for factories in the old liberated areas of North China because we have extreme democracy in many places. Secondly, regarding the organization and tasks of the Factory Management Committee, everyone felt that it was different from what was proposed at the North China Industry and Commerce Conference and the Ordnance Industry Conference. In the past, our understanding of the Factory Management Committee was just a form of the factory director taking the mass line, like a consultative body. This time, the Labor Conference proposed that it is "the unified leadership organ of the factory," "discussing and deciding on various issues related to factory or enterprise management," but only mentioned that "the factory director has the power to suspend resolutions passed by the majority if they are inconsistent with the interests of the enterprise or instructions from higher authorities," and "the factory director has the power to handle urgent issues," without explicitly stating that the factory director has the ultimate decision-making power (which was mentioned in the case of private enterprises). Does this mean that, except for these two special circumstances, the principle of "minority obeying the majority" (even the factory director must obey everyone) should be followed in the Factory Management Committee? Will this lead to anarchy in the factory? Please reply.

　　Answer: The issue of "democratic management" is explained very clearly in the Labor Conference resolution. It clearly points out that the Factory or Enterprise Management Committee, under the leadership of higher-level and state enterprise organs, is the unified leadership organ of the factory or enterprise, with the factory director or manager serving as chairman, discussing and deciding on various issues related to factory or enterprise management and production. At the same time, it specifically points out that if the manager or factory director believes that a resolution passed by a majority of the Factory or Enterprise Management Committee conflicts with the interests of the factory or enterprise or is inconsistent with instructions from higher authorities, the manager or factory director has the power to suspend its execution and report to higher authorities for instructions. If a majority of the members of the Factory Management Committee believe that the measures taken by the factory director or manager are inappropriate or have objections to their report, they can also report their opinions to higher authorities simultaneously for instructions. However, before instructions are received, the decision of the manager or factory director should be implemented. This does not conflict with Article 3 of the North China Industry and Commerce Conference, because "the factory director has the final decision-making power on production plans," and "the manager or factory director has the power to suspend execution when it conflicts with the interests of the factory or enterprise or is inconsistent with instructions from higher authorities" are not fundamentally different in meaning. Therefore, it is incorrect to say that democratic management should be regional and is not applicable to factories in the old liberated areas of North China. "Democratic management" is a universally applicable principle and must be grasped not only in the Northeast but also in North China and other liberated areas. Currently, some factories simply emphasize management and do not pay attention to mobilizing the consciousness, enthusiasm, and creativity of workers, and do not pay attention to the welfare and democratic rights of workers. Some factories do not have a Factory Management Committee at all, or if they do, it does not function. The most fundamental reason for these phenomena is that they do not believe in the power of the workers and do not have the idea of relying on the workers to serve the workers. These phenomena must be changed. Naturally, on the other hand, certain extreme democratic phenomena should continue to be overcome and prevented, because extreme democracy is incompatible with correct democracy. Our democracy is democratic centralism, which is both democratic and centralized. Promoting democracy among workers is only beneficial to enhancing the labor enthusiasm and disciplinary consciousness of employees, ensuring the implementation of policies and regulations, and completing production tasks.

### “管理民主化”的原则　解放区工厂都适用

　　“管理民主化”的原则
  　解放区工厂都适用编辑同志：
    我们在学习劳动代表大会“关于中国职工运动当前任务的决议”时，对于第三章第四节中关于“管理民主化”这一原则有了些争论；有的说管理民主化这一口号在东北合适，因为他是新解放区；在华北老解放区的工厂不合适，因为我们在很多地方存在着极端民主化的现象。其次是关于工厂管理委员会的组织和任务，大家觉得与华北工商会议、兵工会议提的不一样。过去我们了解的工厂管理委员会只是厂长走群众路线的形式，好象参议机关似的；这次劳大却提出它是：“工厂的统一领导机关”，“讨论并决定有关工厂或企业管理的各种问题”，但只提到“多数人通过的决议如与企业利益或上级指示不合时，厂长有停止之权”，“有紧急问题厂长有处理之权”，而没有明确提出厂长有最高决定权（在私人企业中是提到了）。这是不是说除了这两种特殊情况外，在工厂管理委员会中要“少数服从多数”（厂长也要服从大家）呢？这是否会造成工厂中的无政府主义呢？请答复。

    答：“管理民主化”的问题，在劳大决议中已说得很清楚，它明确的指出：工厂或企业管理委员会在上级和国家企业机关领导之下，为工厂或企业的统一领导机关，由厂长或经理任主席，讨论并决定有关工厂或企业管理和生产中的各种问题；同时，它又更具体的指出了工厂或企业管理委员多数通过的决议，如经理或厂长认为与该厂或该企业利益相抵触或与上级指示不合时，经理或厂长有停止执行之权，并报告上级请求指示。如工厂管理委员会多数委员认为厂长或经理这种措施不适合或对其报告有异议时，亦可将自己的意见同时报告上级，一并请求指示，但在未得指示前，应执行经理或厂长的决定。这与华北工商会议第三条，并没有冲突，因为“有关生产计划厂长有最后决定权”，和“与该厂或该企业利益相抵触或与上级指示不合时，经理或厂长有停止执行之权。”在意义上并没有根本不同。因此说管理民主化，要有区域性，在华北老解放区的工厂不适用，这种说法是不对的。“管理民主化”是普遍通用的原则，不只在东北，在华北或其他解放区都是必须掌握的。现在有些工厂单纯强调管理不注意发动工人的自觉性、积极性、创造性，不注意工人的福利和民主权利，有的工厂根本没有工厂管理委员会，或者有亦不起作用，造成这些现象的最根本原因，就是不相信工人力量，没有依靠工人为工人服务的思想。这些现象必须改变。自然，另一方面，某些极端民主的现象也应继续克服与防止的，因为极端民主与正确的民主是不相容的，我们的民主是既民主又集中的民主集中制。发扬工人中的民主，这对提高职工的劳动积极性和纪律自觉性，保证政策法令之执行，生产任务之完成是只有好处的。
