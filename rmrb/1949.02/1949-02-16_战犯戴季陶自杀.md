Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 13th—Dai Jitao, one of the key decision-makers of the Kuomintang reactionary group and a war criminal, committed suicide by taking sleeping pills in Guangzhou on the evening of the 11th of this month, and died on the morning of the 12th. This is another sign that the Kuomintang reactionary and traitorous group has reached the end of its rope. Dai Jitao has been Chiang Kai-shek's counter-revolutionary partner for more than 20 years and one of the earliest "theoreticians" of the Kuomintang reactionaries. He is currently a standing member of the Kuomintang Central Executive Committee and the director of the National History Museum of the pseudo-Presidential Palace. Dai Jitao is the second of Chiang Kai-shek's loyal lackeys to commit suicide since the end of last year, the first being Chen Bu Lei, the secretary-general of the Kuomintang Central Political Committee, who committed suicide on November 13th last year.

　　战犯戴季陶自杀
    【新华社陕北十三日电】国民党反动集团的重要决策人之一战犯戴季陶本月十一日晚在广州服安眠药自杀，于十二日上午毙命。这是国民党反动卖国集团已经山穷水尽的又一标志。戴季陶是蒋介石二十余年来的反革命伙伴和国民党反动派最早的“理论家”之一，现任国民党中央执行委员会常务委员及伪总统府国史馆馆长。戴季陶为去年底以来蒋介石的忠实走狗中自杀的第二人，第一人系去年十一月十三日自杀的国民党中政会秘书长陈布雷。
