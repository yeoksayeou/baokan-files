　　Fuping Carpenter Tian Peirong
  　Creates "Human-Powered Water Pump"
    [This Dispatch] Tian Peirong, a carpenter from Fuping, enthusiastically worked to improve irrigation tools. After years of experimentation, he successfully created a "Human-Powered Water Pump." He used to be very poor, starting to learn carpentry at the age of seventeen to support his family. By the age of twenty, he had mastered a good set of skills. In the 31st year of the Republic of China (1942), the harvest was poor, and the finished products could not be sold, making life difficult. He went to the Gaojie Village area to do odd jobs. At that time, he saw that the land in Gaojie Village, which was high above the riverbank, was still dry land even though it was close to the river. This inspired him to create a "water-powered waterwheel" to turn dry land into paddy fields. From then on, he began to carefully research "water-powered waterwheels." After many failed experiments, in the 34th year of the Republic of China (1945), he failed to create a "lever-operated water press"; in the 35th year (1946), he transformed the "lever-operated water press" into a "hand-held water pump," but it was still unsuccessful. Although he had failed in many experiments over the years, he was not discouraged and continued his research. Last autumn, upon hearing the call for "increasing production by an inch," he immediately began to trial-produce a "water-powered water pump," and his patient research finally succeeded. Because the weather was cold and the canals were frozen, making it temporarily difficult to test, he changed the "water-powered water pump" into a human-powered water pump. The "Human-Powered Water Pump" was tested on the banks of the Shahe River, proving to be a light, labor-saving, simple-structured, and effective irrigation tool. It is easy to manufacture; twenty iron and woodworking workers can make it. The entire structure is also very simple, weighing only fifty catties, and one person can carry it away. It is easy to use; one person can turn it (if the riverbank is high or the well is deep, the suction pipe can be made longer and the diameter smaller, and one person can still use it). It has good irrigation efficiency, saving a lot of labor compared to using a pulley to irrigate the land, and it is more convenient than a waterwheel, with similar effectiveness. With a suction pipe diameter of 3.5 inches and a body length of 6 feet, it can irrigate eight mu of land per day; with a diameter of 2.5 inches, it can irrigate four mu of land per day. It is most suitable for land on high riverbanks and can also be used in wells. After the trial, the audience unanimously praised it, and fellow villagers immediately ordered and rushed to buy it. The successful trial production of the "Human-Powered Water Pump" has further inspired Tian Peirong's interest and confidence in creating irrigation tools. He is now working on the research of a "livestock-powered water pump," and after the thaw, he will test the "water-powered water pump."

　　阜平木匠工人田培荣
  　创制“人力抽水机”
    【本报讯】阜平城厢木匠工人田培荣，热心努力改良水利工具，经多年的试验，创制“人力抽水机”成功。他过去非常贫穷，从十七岁就开始学木匠活，借此养家糊口。到廿岁学成了一套好手艺。民国卅一年，年景歉收，做出的成品推销不了，生活不来，他便到高街村一带卖做零活。当时，他看到高街村临河高岸的土地，虽紧靠河水，但浇不上，旱地还是旱地，就有了创制“水打水车”，变旱田为水田的志愿。从此以后，他就开始精心研究“水打水车”，经多次试验失败，民国卅四年，创制“杠杆压水机”又失败；三十五年，把“杠杆压水机”改造为“手提抽水机”，还是不成功。虽经多年试验失败，但他并不灰心，一样继续研究。去年秋，听到“生产长一寸”的号召，随即动工试做“水打抽水机”，耐心研究终告成功。因天气寒冷，水渠冻结，暂不易试用，便由“水打抽水机”改成人力抽水机。“人力抽水机”经在沙河岸试用结果，证明是种轻便、省力、构造简单而效力良好的水利工具。制造容易，有二十个铁、木工即可制成，全部构造也很简单，重量不过五十斤，一人就可背走，使用省劲，一人便能转动（如河岸高或井深的地方，可将吸水管做长些，口径细点，一人也能使用）。浇田效力良好，比用辘辘浇地省很多工；比水车方便，效力也不次。吸水管口径三寸五、身长六尺的，一天能浇八亩地；口径二寸五的，一天能浇四亩地。它最适合于临河的高岸土地，井内也能使用。试后，观众一致说好，随即有老乡订做、争购。“人力抽水机”的试制成功，更鼓起田培荣创造水利工具的志趣和信心。现正着手研究“畜力抽水机”，待解冻后，便试用“水力抽水机”。
