The General Branch held a special meeting a few days ago to conduct a review following the General Office's indication of statistical errors in the manuscript "Increased Production of Employees at Taihang Shigiejie Coal Mine." (The General Office pointed out: The statement in the manuscript "using gray iron to replace steel-made tension rope trolley wheels saves 200 times the cost every three months" is incomprehensible. The stated savings can only be a percentage of the original cost, not a multiple; the term "past" does not specify a fixed time period, making comparison impossible). In addition to reviewing the errors in the manuscript, the comrades generally conducted preliminary checks on their work attitude, particularly clarifying how to treat the General Office's instructions, and established improvement measures.

    I. Regarding the use of statistics. Errors were not only found in the Shigiejie employee production increase manuscript, but also in other manuscripts. The general manifestations are as follows: 1. Abuse of numbers, a running account that fails to explain the problem; 2. Some figures are extremely inaccurate, such as the number of businesses in City A and City B being the same, but the size of each business varies, and the figures cannot specifically explain this; 3. Frequent use of approximate numbers (indefinite numbers), such as "more than ten people," "more than a million," "seven or eight people," "ten or so li"; 4. Due to a lack of specialized knowledge, it is impossible to distinguish the authenticity of the figures in manuscripts related to industry, commerce, urban areas, and economic work; 5. Inconsistent figures, for example, the industrial number of a city as reported by the Party committee statistician is one figure, while the government statistician reports another, sometimes making it impossible to determine which is correct; 6. Failure to diligently and responsibly study the meaning of each number and what problem it is intended to illustrate, thus using numbers without consideration, echoing others' statements, and lightly skipping over numbers during editing, resulting in many omissions, and even contradictory numbers appearing in the same manuscript. Everyone agreed that numbers should not be abused in the future, and their function and accuracy should be thoroughly investigated.

    II. Work attitude issues: From the inspection, it was felt that our work lacked a serious and responsible work attitude and style, with many instances of superficiality and a lack of thorough understanding. During the editing process, some parts were felt to be inappropriate, and even unclear to the editors themselves. To avoid the trouble of questioning the branch offices and reporters, to meet deadlines, and sometimes even to fill up the number of articles, compromises were made and published, resulting in frequent errors. In the future, we should learn the General Office's serious and responsible attitude of pursuing the root of the matter. Only in this way can we improve ourselves, improve the branch offices and reporters, and improve the entire reporting work.

    III. How to treat the General Office's instructions. This is the most important issue that everyone felt during this review. Only by effectively resolving this issue can we have the conditions to guarantee progress in our work. The numerical errors in the "Shigiejie Production Increase" manuscript occurred after the General Office's instruction "Regarding the use of statistics, prohibit the abuse of dialects and abbreviations." We often find that many errors are those that the General Office has repeatedly pointed out. Why? The reason is that we have not studied the General Office's instructions sufficiently, and we should "re-read them." These mistakes mostly occur due to "ignorance" or "a lack of thorough understanding." Everyone's attitude towards the General Office's instructions is limited to subjective respect. Although every instruction from the General Office is felt to be pertinent, timely, and important, due to a lack of proper study, discussion, and learning, although there is an impression in the mind, it cannot be detached from practical work, and in reality, the General Office's instructions are still placed behind us. The spirit of the General Office's past instructions has not been truly understood. Therefore, we have decided: 1. Compile an abstract of the General Office's past instructions, print and distribute it to every editor and reporter for careful study, or extract several points and paste them on our desks as a constant reminder. 2. In the future, whenever there is an instruction from the General Office, after circulation, we must conduct research and discussion in conjunction with our own work, and formulate measures to implement the instruction. 3. Strengthen business learning and inspection, periodically summarize the manuscripts sent to the General Office, and impose disciplinary action on those who commit major errors.

### 总分社对“太行石圪节增产”稿错用统计数字的检查

　　总分社对“太行石圪节增产”稿错用统计数字的检查
    接到总社指出“太行石圪节煤矿职工增产”稿中所犯使用数字错误（总社指出：该稿中有“以灰铁代替钢制的绷绳花车轮，每三个月能比过去节省成本二百倍”一语不通。所说节省数只能是原数的百分之几十几，不能是倍数；所说“过去”，究指多长期限，没有固定时间，便无从比起。）之后，常于日前召开专门会议，进行检讨，除就该稿错误检讨外，一般同志都初步作了工作态度的检查，特别是明确了如何对待总社指示的问题，并订出了改进办法。
    一、关于使用统计数字问题。不仅石圪节职工增产稿有错误，在其它稿件中，亦有此种毛病。一般的有下列表现：一、滥用数字，一笔流水帐，不能说明问题；二、有些数字极不精确，如甲城与乙城之商业家数虽相同，但各家之规模大小则有别，数字均不能具体予以说明，三、多用约数（不定数），如“十余人”、“百余万”、“七、八人”、“十来里”等；四、由于专门知识缺乏对有关工商业、城市、经济工作等稿中的数字，无法辨分真伪；五、数字不统一，即以一个城市的工业数为例，党委统计者为一数字，政府统计者则为另一数字，有时莫衷一是；六、未认真负责的研究每个数字的含义与用以说明什么问题，故在用数字时，不加考虑，人云亦云，编稿中遇有数字处，即轻轻放过，疏漏甚多，甚至在同一稿中，前后数字矛盾百出，大家认为今后不能滥用数字，用必究其作用与精确程度。
    二、工作态度问题：从检查中，感到我们的工作缺乏严肃负责的工作态度与作风，粗枝大叶不求甚解之处颇多。在编稿中，有些地方本身亦觉其不妥，甚至自己都不明确，为了嫌追问分社、记者麻烦，为了赶时间，甚至有时为了凑篇数，迁就发出，因而错误时生。今后应该学习总社严肃负责、追根究底的老实态度，只有这样才能提高自己，提高分社与记者，才能改进整个报导工作。
    三、如何对待总社指示的问题，这是这次检讨中大家感到最重要的问题，只有有效地解决此一问题，才能有条件地保证工作的进步。“石圪节增产”稿中数字错误是发生在总社“关于使用统计数字，禁止滥用方言土语、简称”指示之后，我们经常发现到许多错误都是总社曾一再指出过的，为什么？原因正是总社指出的我们研究总社指示不够，应该“重读一遍”，这些错多是处于“不知”或“不求甚解”的情况下发生的。大家对总社的指示只停留于主观的尊崇，虽然对总社每一指示均感到中肯、及时、重要，但因缺乏好好研究，讨论与学习，脑中虽有一印象，但不能脱于实际工作中，实际上仍是将总社指示置诸脑后。没有真正了解总社历次指示的精神。因此我们决定：一、将过去总社指示摘要编出，印发每个编辑记者，好好学习或摘出数点贴于座右，以资时有策励。二、今后每有总社指示，传阅后，必须进行结合本身工作研究讨论，订出执行指示的办法。三、加强业务学习与检查，定期总结向总社所发之稿，对犯重大错误者，应予纪律处分。
