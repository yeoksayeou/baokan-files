Xinhua News Agency, Central Plains, 11th: Since the liberation of Kaifeng and Luoyang, the employees of the Longhai Railway have been working actively with a new labor attitude, making many contributions to supporting the People's Liberation War. After the second liberation of Kaifeng on October 24th last year, the Longhai Railway employees repaired the Zhongmu Bridge and the damaged tracks within two days, thus resuming traffic with Zhengzhou on the 27th. When Shangqiu was liberated on November 6th, the Kaifeng Engineering Section rushed to Minquan overnight to repair eastward. The railway, which was originally planned to be laid in four days, was completed in two days. On December 1st, Xuzhou was liberated. On the evening of the 2nd, the first batch of east-bound trains departed from Kaifeng, resuming work at all stations between Dangshan and Xuzhou. In total, in November and December last year, railway employees completed the transportation of 27,410 tons of goods, and carried more than 43,680 passengers during the same period. Workers at the Luoyang Station spike repair factory, in order to supply spikes to the Xuchang section to expedite the repair of the Ping-Han Railway, used 111 furnaces in a continuous day's work to produce 18,250 spikes, whereas in the past they could only produce 8,880 spikes per day. More than 80 workers in the section's "flying squad" (i.e., mobile work team) loaded more than 30,000 sleepers to the front in five days.

　　汴洛铁路员工积极修路支前
    【新华社中原十一日电】解放后的开封洛阳两地陇海铁路员工以新的劳动态度积极工作，对支援人民解放战争，作了许多贡献。去年十月二十四日开封二次解放后，陇海铁路员工两天内即修复中牟大桥和被毁路轨，因而在二十七日即与郑州通车。十一月六日商邱解放，开封工务段工程队连夜赶到民权，向东赶修，原计划四天铺好的铁路，两天即告完成。十二月一日徐州解放，二日晚首批东进列车便由开封出发，恢复了砀山与徐州间各站的工作。总计去年十一、十二两个月内，铁路员工共完成了二万七千四百一十吨物品的运输任务，同时期内载运旅客四万三千六百八十余名。洛阳车站道钉修配厂工人为了供给许昌段道钉以赶修平汉路，以一天的连续工作，用一百一十一盘烘炉突击出一万八千二百五十个道钉，而过去每天只能打出八千八百八十个。该段飞班（即机动工作的班）工人八十余人，五天内即向前方装运枕木三万余根。
