[Jizhong Telegram] Thirty Mile Village in Ding County used confiscated wealth to purchase waterwheels, completely transforming the entire village into irrigated land. Thirty Mile Village in Ding County has 122 water wells and 56 waterwheels. During the winter when confiscated wealth was being distributed, village cadres, following the call from higher levels to develop production, planned to invest the wealth into production. The village cadres gathered all the farmers into groups for mobilization and discussion. Afterwards, everyone unanimously agreed to sell the confiscated wealth to buy waterwheels. Some said, "This time when distributing confiscated wealth, let's not be like in the spring, where we had useless things, completely divided zero, and didn't accomplish anything worthwhile." Others said, "Our village people mainly rely on farmland. If we buy waterwheels with the confiscated wealth to irrigate the land, we'll be firmly rooted in wealth." Based on everyone's opinions, the village cadres discussed and decided to sell the confiscated wealth. It was only enough to buy six waterwheels. People all wanted to buy more, so everyone researched a method: "Based on the area of irrigated land and the ability to bear the burden, we voluntarily pool shares." People were all very happy to contribute, and they bought a total of 21 waterwheels. Together with the existing 56, there were a total of 77. As a result, all 1,092.3 mu of land in the village were completely transformed into irrigated land. Not a single farmer in the village was unhappy.

  　用浮财购买水车
  　全村变成水浇地
    【冀中电】定县三十里铺使用浮财购置水车，使全村完全变成水浇地。定县三十里铺村，有浇地的水井一百二十二眼，水车五十六架，在冬季分浮财时，村干部本着上级发展生产的号召，计划把浮财投入到生产中去。村干部召集全体农民分组进行了动员讨论后，大伙一致意见是把浮财变卖置买水车。有的说：“这回分浮财，可别象春天一样了，有用没用的东西，完全零分了，也没干了正事。”还有的说：“咱村的人们主要是指着庄稼地，要把浮财买成水车浇地，咱们可就扎下富根了。”村干部根据大伙的意见，经过合计，把浮财折卖了，只能买六架水车，人们都愿意多买，于是大伙研究的办法是：“根据浇地面积和负担能力自愿凑股，人们都很高兴的凑了款，共买了水车二十一架，连旧有的共七十七架，这样一来，全村的一千零九十二亩三分地，完全变成了水浇地，全村农民没有一个不欢喜的。
