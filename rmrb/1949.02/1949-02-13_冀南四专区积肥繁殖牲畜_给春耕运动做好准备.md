(Jinan Telegram) The Fourth Special District of Southern Hebei has achieved great results in accumulating fertilizer, composting, purchasing, and breeding livestock in preparation for the spring plowing campaign. Wang Enrong of Xiangjia Village in Guangzong County composted eleven large carts of fertilizer in one month, and the villagers followed suit, digging manure pits in every household. The West Gate Production Committee of the county formulated a plan to compost ninety-six carts of fertilizer before the New Year (lunar new year). The Chengguan subdistrict also added one hundred and eleven new manure pits, preparing to apply at least one and a half carts of manure to each mu of land. Currently, the fertilizer accumulation work in various places has shifted from general appeals to planned and organized actions. Each village first selects production experts to introduce their winter fertilizer accumulation experiences and methods, and then calls on each household to formulate plans. Nanhe County has 10,514 livestock, producing 74,824 carts of manure annually. Its 129,245 people can accumulate 64,732 carts of fertilizer, with 5,326 manure pits capable of composting 179,716 carts of fertilizer. In Baixiang County, 18,180 carts of fertilizer have been composted in fourteen villages. Zhang Ying of Beitian Village built the first pit to compost forty carts of fertilizer, and the second pit is almost ready. He plans to compost one hundred carts of fertilizer before the New Year. Since the War of Resistance Against Japan, Beiyang Village in the First District of the county has not purchased fertilizer for the land. Since the completion of the land reform, farmers have been relieved of their ideological concerns. Only ten new middle peasants have purchased 4,500 jin of hemp dregs from other counties, and twenty-one middle peasants have purchased 22,700 jin of fertilizer. The special district has now purchased and bred over 14,400 livestock. Nangong increased from 12,514 livestock last spring to 18,128 head, and Nanhe also increased from 8,000 to 10,514 head. After suffering from floods, Longyao (newly established county) temporarily decreased from 11,549 livestock to 9,900 head, but increased by 327 head in November. When promoting and leading this work, various counties attach importance to organizing livestock breeding, widely publicizing reward methods, holding symposiums for bull owners to exchange experiences, and helping solve their various difficulties. Julu County publicized reward policies such as exempting three months of corvée labor before and after the calving of cows, which greatly encouraged farmers' interest in breeding livestock. Farmers took advantage of the winter slack season to breed livestock, and 233 heads have been bred. In Guangzong, fourteen bulls have bred 321 heads. The best in the Fourth District is one bull who bred fifty heads, receiving praise and rewards from the government. Furthermore, the methods of adjusting wartime labor burdens have been generally adopted. After correcting some of the past unfair tendencies in dispatching labor, livestock in various counties has greatly increased. In the small village of Zuochengdian with about 200 households in Yongzhi County alone, fifty-one cattle were purchased. Since the end of the land reform in Chengyang Village, Baixiang County, twenty-one new livestock have been added. One middle peasant sold rags and sheep in an attempt to buy a livestock. Recently, in order to prevent livestock epidemics, various counties have also established veterinary stations and strictly prohibit slaughtering to ensure the accelerated breeding of livestock. The widespread accumulation of fertilizer and the large increase in livestock have prepared many favorable conditions for the upcoming spring plowing campaign.

　　冀南四专区积肥繁殖牲畜
  　给春耕运动做好准备
    【冀南电】积肥沤肥购买繁殖牲畜，给春耕运动做好准备工作，四专区已获巨大成绩。广宗相家庄王恩荣一个月沤肥十一大车，全村村民也跟着积极干起来，户户挖了粪坑。该县西关生产委员会订出计划，争取年前（旧历年，下同）沤肥九十六车，城关小区也添新粪坑一百一十一个，准备每亩地至少上一车半粪，现各地积肥工作已由一般号召走向有计划有组织的行动，各村先选出生产能手，介绍其冬季积肥经验办法，然后号召各户订计划。南和县有牲口一万零五百一十四头，一年积粪七万四千八百二十四车，人十二万九千二百四十五口，能积肥六万四千七百三十二车，粪坑五千三百二十六个，能沤粪十七万九千七百一十六车。柏乡十四个村中已沤肥一万八千一百八十车，北天村农民张英筑第一坑沤肥四十车，现第二坑又快沤好，他计划年前沤肥一百车。该县一区北阳村从抗日战争以来，未买过肥料上地，自结束土改完成后，农民们解除了思想顾虑，仅十户新中农即从外县买回麻参四千五百斤，二十一户中农买肥料二万二千七百斤。该专区现已购买繁殖牲口一万四千四百余头，南宫去春只有牲畜一万二千五百一十四头，现增至一万八千一百廿八头，南和也由八千头增至一万零五百一十四头。隆尧（新设县）遭水灾后，曾一度由一万一千五百四十九头牲畜减至九千九百头，十一月份即增加三百廿七头。各县在推动领导这一工作时，重视组织牲畜的繁殖，广泛宣传奖励办法，召开种牛户座谈会交流经验，并帮助解决其各种困难。巨鹿县宣传母牛产前后免差三个月等奖励政策，大大鼓励了农民繁殖牲口的兴趣，农民趁冬闲季节纷纷让牲畜搭配，目前已配成二百卅三头。广宗有十四头种牛已配成三百廿一头，四区最好增一个种牛即配成五十头，得到政府的表扬和奖励。再即是各地普遍调整了战勤负担办法。纠正了过去某些支差不公的偏向后，各县牲口大增，仅永智县作×店二百户左右的小村，即购买了五十一头牛。柏乡县成阳村结束土改以来，新添牲口二十一头，一户中农卖破布卖羊，设法买进了一个牲口。最近为防止牲口闹瘟病，各县又设置了兽医站，并严禁宰杀，以保证牲畜的加速繁殖。普遍积肥与牲口的大量增加这就给即将展开的春耕运动，准备了许多有利条件。
