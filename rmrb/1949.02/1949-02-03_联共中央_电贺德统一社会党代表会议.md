TASS and Telegraph Agency of the Soviet Union report: At the congress of the Socialist Unity Party of Germany on the 26th, representatives of fraternal parties from the Soviet Union, France, Poland, Romania, Hungary, and Greece delivered congratulatory speeches.

Suslov recited the congratulatory telegram from the Central Committee of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union to the Congress of the Socialist Unity Party of Germany, stating: "The Central Committee of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union sends fraternal greetings to the Congress of the Socialist Unity Party of Germany and congratulates it on its outstanding work achievements. The Socialist Unity Party of Germany has done a great deal in uniting the democratic forces of the German people to accomplish the historic transformation of Germany towards a new, peaceful, and democratic path. In its struggle for a unified and democratic Germany, the Socialist Unity Party of Germany embodies the best internationalist revolutionary traditions of the German proletariat and represents the national interests of the German people. The Central Committee of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union respectfully wishes the Socialist Unity Party of Germany further consolidation of the democratic transformation and improvement of the material welfare of the working people; and respectfully wishes it victory and success in the struggle for a unified, peaceful, and democratic Germany, against the division of the country and against the new warmongers who attempt to drag Germany into new military disasters and their German lackeys. We are confident that the Socialist Unity Party of Germany—the vanguard of German democracy—will gloriously accomplish the great historical tasks before it. Long live the unity of the working people of all countries fighting for peace and democracy! Long live the Socialist Unity Party of Germany! The Central Committee of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union (signed)." Suslov recited the concluding part of the telegram in German, and the entire venue responded with thunderous applause. All the representatives stood up. Shouts of "Long live the great socialist country!" "Long live the glorious Bolshevik Party!" and "Long live Stalin, the friend of the people!" echoed throughout the venue. The attendees sang the Internationale. Grotewohl, who presided over the meeting on behalf of the Socialist Unity Party of Germany, expressed warm gratitude for the congratulatory telegram from the Central Committee of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union to the Socialist Unity Party of Germany, conveyed by Suslov. The representatives then proceeded to discuss Pieck's report from the 25th. At the evening session, Ulbricht, Vice-Chairman of the Socialist Unity Party, presented a lengthy report on national and economic policies and the implementation of the two-year plan.
