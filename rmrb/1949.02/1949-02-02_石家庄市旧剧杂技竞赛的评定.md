　　Appraisal of Old Opera and Acrobatics Competition in Shijiazhuang City

　　The old opera performers in Shijiazhuang City launched a competition to celebrate the New Year. Participating in this competition were the Revitalization Opera Troupe, Yihe Ping Opera Troupe, Long Shunhe String Band, and all acrobatic performers of the Acrobatics Federation. The results of the competition have been assessed by the city's Drama and Music Work Committee and the judges they hired, and awards will be presented this Friday. The prizes include award banners and certificates, divided into individual and group awards. All parties were very interested in the acrobatic performers' competition performance. On the day of the fourth performance, the audience was full. A well-known dramatist from Beiping said: This is very fresh and gratifying, and he had not seen it before arriving in the liberated area. Musician He Luting also attended despite his illness and watched until the end. He appreciated the tune of Jingyun Dagu, saying it was similar to recitation. Liu Kuixue's new "Foreign Film" titled "Defeat Chiang Kai-shek in About a Year" was well received. The performers were in high spirits, trying their best to rehearse new lyrics, and the performance effect was very good. Their simple style and rigorous attitude towards art were also praised, which shows the progress of the old artists in the city in political thought over the past year.
　　The three old opera groups participating in the competition all performed well this time, and each had its own strengths. "Revitalization" has a good work spirit, good skills, and a serious stage style. They rehearsed many big plays around the New Year and were rated first. "Yihe" has had good performance effects in previous performances, and the plots, such as "Baoshan Joins the Army" and "Transformation of a Good-for-Nothing," are combined with reality. The whole group has made ideological progress and has a good learning attitude; however, they are not rigorous enough in their work attitude and are rated second. The "Zhengqi Map" performed by the Long Shunhe String Band was the most successful in this competition, but they rehearsed too few new plays and their work style needs to be improved. This time, they were awarded a single award banner for their performance of "Zhengqi Map."
　　In the acrobatics department, three people won awards for their creations: Zhang Yongxi, Qiu Xinhong, and Xu Bangcai. They can all create boldly, or use old forms with new content, but they are not rich enough in vocabulary. This performance included "Down with Chiang Kai-shek and Settle the Accounts," "Husband and Wife Supporting the Army," and "Chiang and Fu's Plans." The acrobatic performers' awards are based on performance effects and usual work performance. The first prize was awarded to "Persuading Husband to Join the Army," a duet by Li Guiqin and Yang Zhimin. The acting and tunes were good and well received by the masses. It was performed many times before the competition, with faster beats, and new soldiers had also seen it. However, it backfired when it was arranged as a play in the competition. The judges decided to give it first place in order to encourage and call for action. The second prize was awarded to Guo Jinling and Wang Suzhen's Xihe Dagu "Li Xiujuan Sells Tofu," which has a strong story with specific characters and detailed words and sentences, and the performing skills are also very skilled. The third prize was awarded to Luo Chengfu, Xue Yuzhen, and Luo Sumei's Daoqing "Fusheng Returns to the Team." The story is vivid, the characters in the story have a development process, and the performance is also good. Others include Zhang Yuxia's Jingyun Dagu "The Crimes of the Kuomintang," Wang Lijun's "Chiang and Fu's Plans," and Xu Xirong, Wang Aijun, and others' "Down with Chiang Kai-shek and Settle the Accounts," Li Shuangxi and Hua Mulan's "Chiang Kai-shek Sighs at Six Watches," etc. In addition, Qiu Yuxian and Ren Yufang were also awarded prizes for their active cultural learning. In total, half of the acrobatic performers won awards this time. Several Peking opera programs were also very popular with the audience, but the current situation of opera is not developing in this direction, so no awards were given. Yan Kuixue and Li Yuqin of the new "Foreign Film" were awarded an award banner, and the Sanhe Tea House and two other companies were each given a group award. The North China Drama and Music Work Committee also gave the Acrobatics Federation a group award banner as a souvenir of this competition performance.

　　石家庄市旧剧杂技竞赛的评定
    重野
    石家庄市旧剧界艺人配合庆祝新年发动了一次竞赛。参加这次竞赛的有革新剧社、义合评剧社、隆顺合丝弦班和杂技联合会全体杂技艺人。竞赛的结果已经本市戏剧音乐工作委员会和他们聘请的评判员评定，准备在本星期五给奖。奖品有奖旗和奖状，分个人奖和团体奖两种。各方对杂技艺人竞赛演出都很感兴趣，在四日演出那天，观众上了满座。一个刚从北平来的全国知名的某戏剧家说：这是非常新鲜可喜的，在他到解放区以前就没看见过。音乐家贺绿汀同志也带病出席，一直看到底，他很欣赏京韵大鼓的曲调，说是和朗诵差不多。刘魁雪的新洋片“一年左右打垮蒋介石”颇得好评。这次演出各个艺人的情绪都很高，尽量排演新词，演出效果也很好，他们的作风朴素和对艺术严谨的态度也同样的被人称赞，这说明了一年来本市旧艺人在政治思想上的进步。
    旧剧参加竞赛的三个班子，这次出演成绩都不错，也各有长处。“革新”的工作精神好、技术好、舞台作风严肃，在新年前后排演了很多大戏，经评定为第一。“义合”历次演出的效果好，剧情象“宝山参军”“二流子转变”等跟现实结合起来，全班思想进步，学习情绪好；在工作态度上还不够严谨，评为第二。隆顺合丝弦班演的“正气图”，在这次竞赛演出中是最成功的，但他们排演的新戏太少，工作作风上还待改进，这次单作一面奖旗奖他们“正气图”的演出。
    杂技部门在创作上得奖的有三个人：张永熙、邱鑫洪、徐邦才。他们都能大胆的创作，或是利用旧形式加上新的内容，在语汇上还不够丰富。这次演出中有“打倒蒋介石把帐算”、“夫妻劳军”、“蒋傅定计”等。杂技艺人的评奖准备是表演效果和平常工作表现。这次评定第一是李桂琴、杨稚敏合唱的“劝夫参军”。在演技和曲调上都不错，很受群众欢迎，在竞赛前演出很多场，落子加快板，新战士也看过。不过在竞赛时排成戏，反而弄巧成拙。评判员为了鼓动和号召，还是决定给予第一。第二是郭金岭、王素真合唱西河大鼓“李秀娟卖豆腐”，故事性很重，故事上有具体的人物，词句很细致，表演技巧也很熟练。第三是罗成福、薛玉贞、罗素梅合唱道情“福生归队”。故事生动，故事中人物发展有过程，表演也不错。以下还有张玉霞的京韵大鼓“国民党的罪行”，王丽君唱的“蒋傅定计”，许喜荣、王爱君等三人合唱的“打倒蒋介石把帐算”，李双喜、花木兰合唱的“蒋介石叹六更”等。另外邱玉仙、任玉芳因为文化学习积极，这次也给奖。总计这次得奖的占杂技艺人中的一半。也有几个皮簧节目演出很受观众欢迎，但今天剧运的情势不向这个方向发展，因此没有给奖。新洋片的阎魁雪和李玉琴给奖旗一面，三合茶社等三家各给予团体奖。华北戏剧音乐工作委员会，并给杂技联合会团体奖旗一面，作为这次竞赛演出的纪念。
