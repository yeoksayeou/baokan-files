Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, February 6th: Reports from various sources: The Executive Committee of the World Federation of Trade Unions (WFTU), in accordance with the decision of the WFTU Executive Bureau, held a meeting in Paris from January 28th to February 1st. The meeting resolved to reject the proposal by reactionary leaders of US and UK trade unions demanding that the WFTU cease its activities. It also decided to hold the WFTU's Second Congress in Milan, Italy, in June, and the preparatory meeting for the Asian Workers' Congress in Peiping in May.

　　This meeting of the WFTU Executive Committee represented 62 million organized workers from five continents. Despite the open efforts of leaders of the British Trades Union Congress to plot the division of the WFTU, representatives of the interests of millions of workers within the British Commonwealth still participated in the meeting. In addition to Mr. Singh from India and Ceylon, there were also Mr. Monk from all of Australia, and Mr. Goodwin from all of Africa. After hearing the detailed report by WFTU Secretary-General Saillant exposing the conspiracies of the US and UK trade union reactionary leaders to undermine the WFTU, the representatives of various countries vehemently criticized the schemes of the US and UK splitters. The meeting then passed a resolution rejecting the proposal of the Standing Committee of the British Trades Union Congress requesting the WFTU to cease its activities. The meeting announced that the Executive Committee would continue its duties: to mobilize trade unions around the world to fight against infringement of workers' economic and social rights, eliminate the remnants of fascism, oppose new wars, and strive for lasting and enduring peace. The meeting elected Italian General Confederation of Labour Secretary-General 維持瑞奥 (Weichi Ruiao) as the Chairman of the WFTU, replacing Mr. Deakin, the representative of the British Trades Union Congress; and elected French General Confederation of Labour Secretary 里普 (Lipu) as one of the Vice-Chairmen of the WFTU, replacing the original French representative 石屋 (Shi Wu) holding that position. The meeting decided to hold the WFTU's Second Congress from June 26th to July 12th in Milan, the industrial center of Italy.

　　The meeting heard and unanimously adopted the report by Chinese representative Liu Ningyi on the activities of trade unions in Asian countries. Liu Ningyi also made a report on the preparatory matters for the Asian Workers' Congress. The meeting adopted Liu Ningyi's proposal to hold the preparatory meeting for the Asian Workers' Congress in the new, people's democratic Peiping in May of this year, in preparation for convening the Asian Workers' Congress in the autumn of this year. The Executive Committee also entrusted Liu Ningyi to submit a report to the All-China Federation of Labor on drafting a work plan for the WFTU in Asia.

　　The Executive Committee meeting also endorsed the decision passed by the Executive Bureau meeting held in Rome in May of last year, namely that various tendencies in the trade union movement can coexist within the WFTU's institutions without any discrimination. The Executive Committee declared that the doors of the WFTU are open to all genuine trade union organizations.

　　The meeting approved the applications of trade unions from Germany, Japan, the Philippines, Cairo, Chile, Malta, Southern Rhodesia, and other places, and accepted them into the WFTU.

　　Before closing, the Executive Committee meeting passed a letter to the working people of the world.

  　定今年五月在北平召开
    世界工联拒斥美英分裂阴谋
    【新华社陕北六日电】各方报导：世界工联执委会按照世界工联执行局的决定，于一月二十八日至二月一日在巴黎举行会议。会议决议拒斥美英职工会反动领袖要求世界工联停止活动的建议，并决定六月间在意大利的米兰举行世界工联第二次代表大会，五月间在北平举行亚洲职工会代表大会筹备会。
    世界工联执委会这次会议，代表五大洲的六千二百万有组织的工人。尽管英国职工大会的领袖们公开策划分裂世界工联，但仍然有代表着不列颠联邦内数百万职工利益的代表参加会议，除印度锡兰的代表辛氏外，还有全澳洲的代表蒙克，全非洲的代表古德温。各国代表在听取了世界工联总书记赛扬揭露美英职工会反动首领破坏世界工联的详尽报告以后，均猛烈抨击美英分裂分子的阴谋。会议旋即通过决议，拒绝英国职工大会常委会要求工联停止活动的建议。会议宣布执委会将继续其职务：动员全世界职工会，为反对侵害工人经济社会权利、消灭法西斯残余、以对新战争、争取巩固与持久的和平而斗争。会议选出意大利总工会总书记维持瑞奥为世界工联的主席，以代替英国职工大会的代表狄金；又选出法国总工会书记里普为世界工联的副主席之一，以代替原任该职的法国代表石屋。会议决定自六月二十六日至七月十二日在意大利工业中心米兰举行世界工联第二次代表大会。
    会议听取了并一致通过了中国代表刘宁一关于亚洲各国职工会活动的报告。刘宁一并作了关于亚洲职工会代表大会筹备事宜的报告。会议通过了刘宁一的建议，决定今年五月间在人民民主的新北平召开亚洲职工会代表大会的筹备会，准备今年秋天召开亚洲职工会代表大会。执委会又委托刘宁一向中华全国总工会提出一个关于草拟世界工联亚洲工作计划的报告。
    执委会会议又认可了去年五月间在罗马举行的执行局会议所通过的决定，即职工运动中的各种倾向可以并存于世界工联的机构内而无任何歧视。执委会宣称：世界工联的大门，是对一切真正的职工会组织开放着的。
    会议批准了德国、日本、菲律宾、开罗、智利、马尔他、南罗德西亚等职工会的申请，接收它们加入世界工联。
    执委会会议在闭幕前通过了告全世界劳动人民书。
