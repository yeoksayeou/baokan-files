　　Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, February 11th: TASS, Paris, February 7th: French Communist Party General Secretary Thorez delivered a speech at the Third Representative Conference of the Communist Party's Seine Province Organization, stating that the aggressive policies of American imperialism and other countries under its control (including France) have hindered the realization of the lasting peace that people of all countries are expecting. The recent statement by the Soviet Ministry of Foreign Affairs and Stalin's reply to Smith have thoroughly exposed the new war preparations being carried out by the American, British, and French governments. Stalin's reply and his suggestion regarding arranging a meeting with Truman have clearly shown who the real instigators of war are and have once again proven that the American, British, and French governments do not want to reach an agreement with the Soviet Union, because such an agreement would hinder their aggressive policies. However, the world's great force is capable of and will certainly crush the imperialist criminal conspiracy. Thorez stated that the Soviet Union is leading the democratic camp and uniting all people who desire peace around the Soviet Union. The Communist Party demands that France stand in the same camp as the Soviet Union—the camp of peace and democracy. The French people agree with the Communist Party's actions. Thorez emphasized that the Communist Party's influence in France has increased. The Communist Party has won important achievements: the Communist Party's influence among the broad masses has become stronger, and the Party has become a great political force. All the by-elections have proven the Communist Party's achievements. Thorez further pointed out that, no matter how the reactionaries attack the Communist Party, they have not been able to divide the Party from its true friends—the old veterans of the Resistance movement and non-Communist Republicans. They continue to fight alongside the Communist Party to establish a democratic and united government.

　　多列士谈法共影响增长
  　必能粉碎新战争阴谋
    【新华社陕北十一日电】塔斯社巴黎七日讯：法共总书记多列士在共产党赛纳省组织第三届代表会议上发表演说称：美帝国主义及受其控制之其他国家（连法国在内）的侵略政策，阻挠了各国人民期待的持久和平的实现。苏联外交部最近的声明以及斯大林对史密斯的答复，已经将美、英、法政府进行的新战争准备揭露无遗。斯大林的答复以及他的关于布置与杜鲁门会晤的建议，已清楚地表明谁是战争的真正挑拨者，并再一次证明了美、英、法政府不想与苏联达成协议，因为这种协议将阻碍它们的侵略政策。然而，世界上伟大的力量是能够和必将粉碎帝国主义犯罪阴谋的。多列士称，苏联正领导着民主阵营，并将一切愿望和平的人民团结在苏联的周围。共产党要求法国与苏联站在一个阵营里——和平与民主的阵营里，法国人民是赞同共产党的行动的。多列士强调指出，共产党在法国的影响已经增加。共产党已赢得重要的成就：共产党在广大群众中的影响已更为强大，党已经成为伟大的政治力量。所有的补缺选举都证明了共产党的成就。多列士又指出，尽管反动派怎样攻击共产党，他们并未能使党与民真实友人——抵抗运动的老战士和非共产党的共和人士分裂，他们继续与共产党一道，为建立民主团结的政府而奋斗。
