Xinhua News Agency, Tianjin, 5th—Commanders and fighters of the "Tenacious Assault Company" of a certain unit of the Northeast Field Army, after participating in the Tianjin liberation campaign, enthusiastically studied Chairman Mao's statement on the current situation on January 14th. When they read Chairman Mao's final call in the statement: "All commanders and fighters of the Chinese People's Liberation Army, take note: Before the reactionary Nanjing Kuomintang government accepts and implements genuine democratic peace, you must not relax your combat efforts in the slightest. Any reactionary who dares to resist must be resolutely, thoroughly, cleanly, and completely eliminated," all commanders and fighters held a discussion meeting on Chairman Mao's statement.

　　Wang Xiangliang, a blasting hero who had won awards, said: "After Japan surrendered, Chairman Mao flew to Chongqing to negotiate with Chiang Kai-shek for the sake of genuine peace. But Chiang Kai-shek, relying on the assistance of his American father, dreamed of eliminating us, calling for peace with empty words while deploying troops to the Northeast and occupying many of our big cities. We still remember how rampant they were when confronting bandit troops north of the Songhua River. It took us three years of arduous struggle, crawling on ice and sleeping in snow, to eliminate the bandit troops piece by piece. Now that they are almost completely finished, they are playing tricks again! If they really want peace, they should accept Chairman Mao's eight conditions."

　　Machine gunner Wang Changde said: "When you hit a wolf, you have to hit it to death; when you cut grass, you have to remove the roots. Leaving the reactionaries alive is a disaster. If they don't accept Chairman Mao's conditions, we will resolutely eliminate them for the people!" Zhao Junqing, who performed meritorious service in Jinzhou, said: "Chiang Kai-shek once said: 'I will not rest in peace until the Communist Party is eliminated.' Now that he has been defeated, he proposes to negotiate peace with the Communist Party! Isn't this a deceptive conspiracy? The eight conditions put forward by Chairman Mao represent the interests of the people."

　　Xi Kelin, a blasting hero who liberated Jinzhou, said: "We must resolutely implement Chairman Mao's call, and we must improve our combat skills. We warn all reactionary Kuomintang generals that if they do not accept Chairman Mao's eight conditions and dare to resist, we will treat them like Fan Hanjie in Jinzhou and Chen Changjie in Tianjin."

　　Liberated soldier Yang Zhiming narrated the various crimes he had witnessed of the Kuomintang army raping, plundering, and oppressing the people, and angrily said: "The Chiang Kai-shek traitorous and reactionary clique has inflicted unspeakable suffering on the Chinese people for more than 20 years. If they still do not accept these eight conditions, we ask our superiors to quickly give us combat missions and quickly eliminate them. If this poisonous snake lives for one more day, the Chinese people will suffer one more day. In the next battle, I must perform meritorious service."

　　Finally, Deputy Company Commander Wang called on everyone: "We resolutely support Chairman Mao's call and will never relax our combat efforts. Wherever there are enemies who dare to resist, we will fight there. Whenever our superiors want us to fight, we will resolutely complete the combat mission. All comrades must make full preparations ideologically and in action, and we must publicize and educate Chairman Mao's statement to new soldiers."

　　东北野战军某部指战员一致表示
    坚决拥护毛主席号召
  　决不松懈战斗的努力
    【新华社天津五日电】东北野战军某部“顽强冲杀连”参加解放天津战役后，即热烈学习毛主席一月十四日对时局的声明，当他们读到毛主席声明最后的号召：“中国人民解放军全体指挥员战斗员同志注意：在南京国民党反动政府接受并实现真正的民主的和平以前，你们丝毫也不应当松懈你们的战斗努力，对于任何敢于反抗的反动派，必须坚决彻底干净全部地消灭之。”全体指战员就召开了一个讨论毛主席声明的座谈会。曾经得奖的爆炸英雄王相亮说：“日本投降以后，毛主席为着真正的和平飞到重庆和蒋介石商谈。但蒋介石依靠他美国爸爸的援助，梦想消灭我们，一面空口叫和平，一面调军队到东北，占领咱们许多大城市。我们还记得在松花江北和匪军对峙的时候，他们是那样猖狂，我们经过三年来的爬冰、卧雪的艰苦奋斗，才把匪军一块一块地消灭。现在他们全部快完蛋了，又出来耍花样了！他们要是真的想和，就应该接受毛主席的八个条件。”机枪射手王常德说：“打狼要打死，斩草要除根，反动派留下是个祸害，他们要不接受毛主席的条件，咱们就坚决替人民除害！”在锦州立功的赵俊清说：“蒋介石曾说过：‘不消灭共产党，死不瞑目。’现在他被打败了，却提出要和共产党谈和了！还不是骗人的阴谋。毛主席提出的八个条件，才是代表人民的利益。”解放锦州的爆炸英雄隰克林说：“我们要坚决执行毛主席的号召，我们要提高战斗技术。我们警告一切国民党反动将领，如果他们不接受毛主席的八个条件，而竟敢于抵抗，我们就叫他象锦州的范汉杰，象天津的陈长捷。”解放战士杨志明叙述了他亲眼看见的国民党军队奸淫掠夺欺压人民的种种罪行后，愤怒地说：“蒋介石这个卖国反动集团，二十多年来给中国老百姓的痛苦说不清，如果他们还不接受这八个条件，咱们要求上级赶快给咱们战斗任务，赶快把他们消灭。这条毒蛇活着一天，中国人民多受一天罪。在下次作战中，我一定要好好立功。”最后王副连长号召大家说：“我们坚决拥护毛主席的号召，决不松懈我们的战斗努力，那里要有敢于反抗的敌人，咱们就打到那里去。上级什么时候要咱们打，咱们就坚决完成战斗任务。全体同志在思想上行动上都要作充分准备，要把毛主席的声明向新战士进行宣传，教育。”
