　　Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, February 24th: TASS, Moscow, February 20th: The "Red Navy" newspaper published an article by Yemasonov entitled "Conspiracy of the American Naval Circles," stating: Recently, under the instigation of American military personnel, many messages have been published in American newspapers saying that the United States will "withdraw" from the Western Pacific. Earlier this month, American newspapers published excerpts from a letter from Secretary of the Navy Sullivan to the chairmen of the Senate and House Military and Appropriations Committees, stating that 72 ships would soon be transferred to reserve and naval personnel would be reduced by 30,000. At the same time, twelve naval bases will also be closed, including bases in the Aleutian Islands, Hawaii, the Philippine Islands, and Guam. Yemasonov pointed out that it is quite obvious that the U.S. Navy Department is trying to create the impression that the United States has reduced the cost of maintaining the navy and bases. Sullivan's letter can serve as an example of the intricate conspiracy that the American military is currently using to cover up their true intentions. Under the cover of this dense smoke screen, the strength of the U.S. Navy is expanding. The movement of the U.S. Navy in the Pacific is by no means an intention to leave the Western Pacific as the United States claims. On the contrary, it indicates that the U.S. Navy is strengthening its activities in the Chinese and Japanese seas. In this regard, it is worth mentioning the demonstrative visit of U.S. Pacific Fleet Commander Ramsey to China. Even before Ramsey arrived in China, Badger declared at the headquarters in Shanghai that the United States intends to maintain a "considerable amount of naval forces on Chinese territory to protect overseas Chinese." Ramsey claimed that the U.S. Navy has no intention of withdrawing from the Western Pacific. He emphasized that he knew nothing about the U.S. wanting to abandon its bases in China. He also believes that Japan is a "potential barrier to prevent the advance of the Communist Party" and said, "Japan has great strategic importance for the U.S. fleet." News has also spread from Far Eastern newspapers that the U.S. Navy intends to use Hong Kong as a base to access South China and to use certain other ports on the South China coast. Yemasonov pointed out that as for Sullivan's claim that 72 warships will be transferred to reserve in the near future, this is just a conspiracy to deceive public opinion. In reality, the active warships transferred to reserve will soon be supplemented by 30 new warships.

### “红海军”报著文揭露  美海军吹嘘从太平洋“撤退”恰是加强对远东侵略活动

　　“红海军”报著文揭露
    美海军吹嘘从太平洋“撤退”恰是加强对远东侵略活动
    【新华社陕北二十四日电】塔斯社莫斯科二十日讯：“红海军”报发表叶马索夫所作题为“美国海军界的阴谋”一文称：近来，在美国军人的策动之下，美国报纸上发表了许多消息，说美国将自太平洋西部“撤退”。在本月初，美国报纸发表了摘自海军部长苏利文致参院与众院军事及拨款委会主席的信，信内声称：不久以后，将有七十二艘舰只转入后备，海军人员将减少三万人。同时，十二个海军基地也将关闭，其中包括阿留申、夏威夷、菲律宾群岛及关岛的基地。叶马索夫指出：十分显然，美国海军部企图用这种办法来造成一种印象，即美国削减了维持海军与基地的费用。苏利文的信可以作为错综复杂之阴谋的一例，目前，美国军界正用这种阴谋来掩盖他们的真正目的。在这种浓密的烟幕掩护下，美国海军的实力却正在扩大着。美国海军在太平洋的移动，绝不是如美国所说的意欲离开西太平洋，恰恰相反，而是表示美国海军在中国与日本海面加强活动。在这方面，值得提出的，是美国太平洋舰队司令兰姆赛对中国的示威性访问，甚至在兰姆赛抵华之前，白吉尔就在上海的司令部宣称：美国拟在中国领土上保持“相当大量的海军，以保护侨民”。兰姆赛声称：美国海军无意自西太平洋撤退。他强调称：他对美国要放弃在中国的基地一事毫无所知。他又认为，日本是“阻止共产党前进的潜在壁垒”，并说：“日本对于美国舰队具有极大的战略重要性”。远东报纸上又传出来这样的消息，美国海军企图利用香港为通往华南的基地以及利用华南海岸的某些其他港口。叶马索夫指出：至于苏利文所谓最近将来将有七十二艘军舰转入后备一说，这只是蒙蔽舆论的阴谋，实际上，转入后备的现役军舰，即将由三十艘新军舰来补充。
