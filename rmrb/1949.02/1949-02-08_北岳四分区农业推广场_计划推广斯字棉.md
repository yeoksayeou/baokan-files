　　North Yue Fourth District Agricultural Extension Station
  　Plans to Promote S Cotton
    [North Yue News] The North Yue Fourth District Agricultural Extension Station plans to propagate S cotton on twelve mu of dry land and one mu of paddy field within the station’s seventy-five mu of land this year. Because of fertilizer shortage on the dry land, last year's yield was nine shi of grain (equivalent to six shi and three dou of rice). This year, it is planned to apply 30 dan of fertilizer per mu, and the yield is expected to reach 110 jin of seed cotton per mu, for a total output of about 1,320 jin. This is much more profitable than planting ordinary crops (according to last year, the station planted four mu of paddy field with S cotton, with an average yield of 300 jin of seed cotton per mu, equivalent to 50 dou of millet, while ordinary crops could only yield 25 dou of millet per mu per year). Therefore, it is planned to completely promote these thousand jin of seed cotton to the masses.
    S cotton not only yields more than ordinary crops, but also has a simple planting method, that is, sowing at the beginning of summer (strip sowing or spot sowing is acceptable). The spacing between plants and rows depends on the fertility of the land. The normal row spacing is one chi and eight cun, and the plant spacing is one chi and a half. Weed twice, top during the early fu period, and you can harvest cotton. However, in most areas, the masses advocate very strict pruning, and the saying that cotton cannot be harvested without pruning affects the concerns about planting S cotton. In order to break this concern, the North Yue Farm has conducted several comparative experiments, and now introduces the results of the 1948 experiment as follows: (1) Those who did not prune yielded 328 jin and 11 liang of cotton per mu, and those who pruned yielded 311 jin and 6 liang. Those who did not prune yielded 17 jin and 6 liang more. (2) Harvest situation: Those who pruned for the first time harvested slightly more, but in subsequent harvests, those who did not prune harvested more. (3) Cotton stalks: Stalks of those who did not prune weighed 486 jin, and those who pruned weighed 364 jin. Those who did not prune yielded 122 jin more.
    According to the experimental results, we do not advocate pruning cotton, because pruning not only wastes manpower, but also reduces the harvest. However, in colder climates, appropriate pruning can improve the quality of cotton and promote early maturity.

　　北岳四分区农业推广场
  　计划推广斯字棉
    【北岳讯】北岳四分区农业推广场，今年计划在全场七十五亩田内，繁殖斯字棉旱地十二亩，水地一亩。此旱地因肥料缺乏，去年产九市斗谷（合米六斗三），今年计划每亩施肥三十担，产量可达到每亩收籽棉一百一十斤。共可产一千三百二十斤左右，这比种植普通作物获利多多（按去年该场曾种了四亩水地斯字棉，每亩平均收获三百斤籽棉，折小米五十斗，而一般作物全年每亩仅可收入二十五斗小米）。所以计划将这千余斤籽棉完全推广到群众中去。
    斯字棉不但产量超过普通作物，种植方法也很简单，即在立夏时播种（条播点播均可），株间行距，根据地质之肥瘠，普通行距为一尺八寸，株距为一尺半。锄苗两遍，初伏时摘尖，就能收花。不过大部地区群众提倡打杈异常严格，不打杈就不能收花的说法，影响到种斯字棉有顾虑。北岳农场为了打破这一顾虑，曾作过数次比较试验，今将一九四八年之试验结果介绍如下：（一）不去杈者每亩收花三百二十八斤十一两，去杈者收花三百一十一斤六两。不去杈者多收十七斤六两。（二）收花情形：第一次去杈者略多收，其后各次则不去杈者较多收。（三）棉柴：不去杈的秸四百八十六斤，去杈的三百六十四斤。不去杈的多收一百二十二斤。
    根据试验结果，我们种棉花不主张去杈，因去杈不但浪费人力，收成也减少。但在气候较冷地区，适当地整枝，能提高棉絮之品质，及促使早熟。
