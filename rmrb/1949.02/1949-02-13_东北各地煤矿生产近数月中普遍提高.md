Xinhua News Agency, Shenyang, 11th -- Coal mine production in various parts of Northeast China has generally increased in recent months. After implementing piece-rate progressive wages and bonus for exceeding quotas in the Northeast No. 1 Coal Mining Area, the output in November last year increased by 10,000 tons compared to October. In mid-November, more than 1,900 people working in the pits received awards for exceeding their predetermined work quotas. The No. 2 and No. 3 mines in the No. 2 Coal Mining Area, based on the specific conditions of each pit, allocated daily output targets to each pit and organized odd-job workers from outside the pits to go down into the pits, thus increasing output by 36%. Since launching a production competition in November last year, the miners in the No. 3 Coal Mining Area have been extremely enthusiastic about production. Nine workers in the Shengli Pit produced 51.5 tons of coal in one day shift, and seven workers in the night shift produced 45 tons, averaging 5.57 to 6.43 tons of coal per person per day, breaking the mine's all-time record. Since resuming work in July last year, the output of the Fuxin Coal Mine has also been continuously increasing. The Sunjiawan Mine under its jurisdiction produced 20,000 tons of coal in December last year, exceeding the monthly plan by 5,000 tons. The output of other coal mines, such as the Xi'an Coal Mine in Liaobei, the Ziziyao Coal Mine in the southwest of Fuxian County, Liaoning, and small and medium-sized coal mines in various places, is also gradually increasing.

　　东北各地煤矿生产近数月中普遍提高
    【新华社沈阳十一日电】东北各地的煤矿生产，近几月中普遍提高。东北第一煤矿区在实行计件累进工资及超额累进奖励后，去年十一月份产量较十月份增加了一万吨。十一月中，坑内因超额预定工数受奖者有一千九百余人。第二煤矿区的二、三两矿，根据各坑的具体情况，分配各坑日产量，并组织坑外杂工下坑，因而产量提高了百分之三十六。第三煤矿区矿工自去年十一月发动生产竞赛后，生产情绪极高。胜利坑日班九个工人，一天即出煤五十一吨半，夜班七人出了四十五吨，平均一人一天出煤五点五七吨到六点四三吨，打破了该矿从来未有的纪录。阜新煤矿自去年七月复工后，产量亦在不断提高。其所辖孙家湾矿，去年十二月份即产煤两万吨，超过了全月计划达五千吨。其他如辽北西安煤矿、辽宁复县西南的咋子窑煤矿以及各地之中小煤矿的产量，亦在逐步提高。
