Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, January 30th: TASS, New York - The National Council of American-Soviet Friendship has issued a statement condemning the planned North Atlantic Alliance as a continuation of the "Cold War." The National Council expressed its distress that the North Atlantic Alliance would, for the first time, commit the United States to a military alliance in peacetime, and condemned Truman for violating his pre-election guarantee that the United States would pursue a policy of world peace. The association declared: The North Atlantic military alliance imposed by the United States (which intends to have American cannons standing tall in Northwest and Southern Europe) will never bring the world the peace it longs for. We call on the American people to rise up and stop this war-mongering plan. We call on all Americans to demand that their elected senators arrange a public hearing by the Senate Foreign Relations Committee on the presentation of opinions on the joint defense plan, so that the voices of the people who oppose this disastrous plan can be heard.

　　美苏友谊全国协会号召
  　反对大西洋联盟计划
    【新华社陕北六日电】塔斯社纽约一月三十日讯：美苏友谊全国协会顷发表声明，谴责计划中的北大西洋联盟为“冷战”的继续。该全国协会对北大西洋联盟将使美国第一次在和平时期委身于军事联盟一事，表示痛心，并谴责杜鲁门违反他在选举前保证美国奉行世界和平政策的声明。协会声称：美国所强加于人的北大西洋军事联盟（它意图使美国大炮林立于西北欧及南欧），将永不能给世界带来它所渴望的和平。我们号召美国人民起而阻止此一酝酿战争的计划。我们号召全美人民要求他们所选出的参议员们，布置参院外委会对联防计划的陈述意见的公开会议，使反对此一灾难性计划的人民的呼声能被听到。
