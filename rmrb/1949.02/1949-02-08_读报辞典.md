　　Rio de Janeiro Treaty - A so-called "Western Hemisphere Joint Defense" Inter-American Treaty signed by American imperialism with Latin American countries in Rio de Janeiro, the capital of Brazil, on September 2nd, 1947, in order to strengthen its political and military control over the Western Hemisphere. The main content of this treaty ostensibly involves the signatory countries using force to "jointly defend against aggression from the Arctic to the Antarctic," but in reality, it is a treaty of aggression by American imperialism against the sovereignty of Latin American countries. This aggressive treaty was forced upon Latin American countries under the manipulation of American imperialism, and the people of Latin American countries strongly opposed it.

It was the ancient capital of the Mughal Empire and has magnificent palaces. In 1912, the British Indian Empire also established its capital here.

To the northwest of Delhi is a new urban area, which is now New Delhi, the capital of India. The Governor, Parliament, and other important government agencies are all located in New Delhi. Delhi is also a center of Islam. The area is a distribution center for various agricultural products of India. Light industry is also relatively developed.

　　Churchill - The most reactionary representative of the British bourgeoisie, the leader of the Conservative Party, and the British Prime Minister during the Second World War. He is an extreme reactionary who has actively stood on the anti-Soviet and anti-people's position since the war, advocating the "Western European Alliance," using the United States and Britain as an axis, and advocating "Franco-German cooperation" to oppose the Soviet Union and resist European democratic forces. He has been clamoring and inciting a third world war everywhere and is a notorious warmonger.

　　International News Service - One of the communication agencies of the most reactionary "Hearst Newspaper Group" of American imperialism. The "Hearst Newspaper Group" is one of the monopoly capital newspaper trusts of American imperialism. This newspaper group represents the interests of American monopoly capitalists, internally supporting and promoting reactionary measures, and opposing all progressive activities of the people; externally, it promotes its reactionary imperialist expansion policy and viciously conducts anti-Soviet and anti-people's democratic propaganda. Its boss is Hearst. It has sixteen morning and evening newspapers, distributed in thirteen cities. Its reputation among the American people is very bad. It often uses "yellow journalism" to numb and fool the American people.

　　United Nations Charter - Drafted by the Soviet Union, the United States, the United Kingdom, and "China" at Dumbarton Oaks in the United States, and passed by representatives of fifty countries in San Francisco from April 2nd to June 26th, 1945.

The Charter stipulates the various conditions for membership, suspension of membership, and expulsion; the powers and procedures of the General Assembly and the Security Council; the peaceful settlement of disputes; actions against threats to peace; regional settlements and the parallel relationship of the United Nations organization; the establishment of an international court, and other important matters.

　　Vandenberg - A Republican senator of the United States, the most reactionary isolationist, and a notorious warmonger. He is actively anti-Soviet and anti-people's democratic movement and strongly advocates that the United States should dominate the world by force. Before the war, he was the leader of the most reactionary "isolationist group" of American imperialism and was also a newspaper publisher in Michigan.

　　National Independence Front - A united front organization led by the Hungarian Communist Party in 1944, composed of various democratic parties and mass organizations. In March 1944, the German Nazi army occupied Hungary, and the Hungarian reactionary Horthy fled. At this time, Hungarian Communist leader Rakosi returned to Budapest, the capital of Hungary, and united the Hungarian people and the three democratic parties, the Smallholders Party, the Social Democratic Party, and the National Peasant Party, to form the "National Independence Liberation Front," bravely resisting the German Nazis, and finally achieved the final victory.
