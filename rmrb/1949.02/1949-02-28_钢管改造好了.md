　　Steel Pipes Successfully Modified
    Zhao Lihua, First Power Plant of Shijiazhuang Electric Company
    The repair division of the First Plant of the Electric Company has gradually expanded and, in addition to undertaking all mechanical repairs for the plant, it also undertakes the repair tasks of the Second Plant and the 320 Plant of the head office. Recently, the boiler steel pipes of the Second Plant broke down, affecting the external power transmission. Therefore, it was necessary to extract the only eleven steel pipes remaining in the plant's inventory to solve the Second Plant's current difficulty in transmitting power. After some workers in the boiler division learned of this, they became very anxious and said, "What if our boiler pipes break down? Why should they take away our precious pipes that we have in storage?"
    Section Chief Zhu patiently explained to everyone, "We should have a broader perspective. We all belong to the same company and serve the people of Shijiazhuang. The Second Plant's steel pipes are currently broken, affecting power transmission, so we should help them solve the problem first. Our boiler here can still hold out for a few more days, but we should think of ways to solve this difficulty as soon as possible."
    Boiler steel pipes are very difficult to find in Shijiazhuang. The thickness and length of these things cannot be off by even a little bit. In the past, when the Japanese and the Kuomintang were in power, they used imported products. If they broke, the power had to be cut off. But now, under the leadership of the Communist Party, the workers' political consciousness and production enthusiasm have been raised to an unprecedented level. They can use the wisdom of the working class to solve material difficulties. Section Chief Zhu is a good example.
    Although Section Chief Zhu is old, he works no less hard than the young people. He put a lot of thought into manufacturing steel pipes and came up with ingenious methods. He used waste pipes in the factory that were not long enough, measured the dimensions, and then welded them together with oxygen. To prevent any danger during future use, he used a cold pump to conduct a safe insurance test on the welded pipes. Normally, each steel pipe must withstand 200 units of pressure to be usable, but now, after welding the waste pipes, the cold pump test has reached 300 units of pressure. There is absolutely no problem with using them. Sixty pipes have already been welded, and welding is continuing. This new contribution by Section Chief Zhu has solved the difficulty of power transmission for various plants.

### 钢管改造好了

　　钢管改造好了
    石家庄电灯公司第一发电厂赵丽华
    电灯公司一厂修理股现在已经逐步扩大，除担任本厂一切机件修理外，又担负了总公司二厂和三二○厂的修理任务。最近二厂的锅炉钢管坏了，影响到对外的送电，因此要抽出本厂库内仅存的十一根钢管，以解决二厂目前不能向外送电的困难。锅炉股有不少工人知道后，就很着急的说：“咱们的锅炉管子还保不住要坏呢？咱们存的几根宝贝管子，为什么让他们拿去呵？”
    朱股长耐心的向大家解释说：“眼光应当放远一点，咱们本来都是属于一个公司的，都是为石家庄人民服务。二厂眼前钢管坏了，影响送电，咱们就应当帮助他们先解决。咱们这儿的锅炉目下还可以顶些日子，不过咱们应当想办法赶紧解决这一个困难才是。”
    锅炉钢管在石家庄是很难找到的，这东西粗细长短差一点都不能用。以往日本人和国民党在时，都用的是舶来品，如果坏了，就只得停电。但是现在共产党领导下的工人，政治觉悟和生产热情都空前的提高了，他们能够发挥工人阶级的智慧来解决物质上的困难。朱股长就是很好的一个范例。
    朱股长年纪虽然很大了，但是他干起活来比年青人不差，他在制造钢管上费了不少的脑筋，想出了巧妙的办法。他利用过去厂里长短不够尺寸的废管子，量好了尺寸，然后再用氧气焊接起来，他为了防止今后使用时发生危险，把焊好的管子用泵冷作了保险安全试验。平常每根钢管要容二百个压力才可以用，现在把废管焊好，用冷泵试验已压到三百个压力了。用起来已毫无问题了。现在已焊好六十根，还在继续焊。朱股长这一新的贡献，解决了各厂向外送电的困难。
