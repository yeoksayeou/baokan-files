Xinhua News Agency, Beiping, February 2nd: The power supply in Beiping City has begun to recover. Trolleybuses, buses, and long-distance buses on the four lines between Beiping and Tianjin, Shunyi, Fengtai, and Zhuoxian resumed operation on the 1st. This is the result of the active work of the employees of the transportation and power departments in Ping City after the People's Liberation Army entered the city. The power equipment, which was severely damaged before liberation, has been repaired by the staff, and more than half of the 1,901 transformers in the city have resumed power transmission, thus providing power supply to tap water, flour, telephone and other enterprises, as well as hospitals, newspapers, news agencies, and radio stations. Before accepting the peaceful conditions of the People's Liberation Army, the Kuomintang army in Beiping extensively sabotaged Beiping's power equipment. The destroyed transmission lines alone in the city reached 17 kilometers. Twenty-seven copper wires were combined into a 33,000-volt high-voltage line, damaging more than 32 tons. The low-voltage lines in the customs area were almost completely destroyed. A large number of wooden poles were cut down for firewood, the wires were dismantled for fortifications, and even the insulating oil in the transformers was taken to light lamps. In addition, the transformers damaged by the Kuomintang military and government agencies stealing electricity are impossible to count.

　　平市电力供应恢复
  　电车汽车恢复行驶
    【新华社北平二日电】北平市内的电力供应开始恢复，电车、公共汽车及北平至天津、顺义、丰台、涿县间的四条线上的长途汽车，已于一日恢复行驶。这是人民解放军入城以后，平市交通、电力部门的职工积极工作的结果。解放前受到严重破坏的电力设备，在员工赶修下，城内的一千九百零一个变电器已有半数以上恢复输电，因而使自来水、面粉、电话等企业及医院、报馆、通讯社、广播台等得到了电力供应。北平国民党军在接受人民解放军的和平条件之前，曾大肆破坏北平的电力设备。全市被损毁的仅输电线路即达十七公里，二十七条铜线合成一条达三万三千高压电线，损坏了三十二吨以上。关区的低压线路，几条全部被毁。大批木质线杆被砍去当柴烧，电线被拆作工事，甚至变电器里的绝缘油也竟被拿去点灯，此外，因国民党军政机关偷电而损毁的变电器，更无法统计。
