　　Experiences in Party Rectification in Key Villages of Huolu, Jingxing, Jianping, and Xingtang
  　How to Solve the Problem of New and Old Cadres?
  　Two Approaches to Concluding Land Reform
    [Comprehensive Report] Huolu, Jianping, Xingtang, and Jingxing counties, under the jurisdiction of the Chahar Province, all successively summarized the work of the first batch of villages completing land reform through party rectification around the end of January. This period of movement lasted approximately twenty days. Each county aimed primarily to gain experience in key villages and issue land certificates in general villages to conclude land reform. Within half a month, Xingtang completed work in twenty-six key villages. Regarding the concluding land reform work in general villages, out of the county's three hundred and twenty-eight villages, one hundred and twenty-two villages needed to carry out the concluding work. Problems have now been resolved in sixty villages. In Huolu, in addition to organizing forces to conduct key experiments, only eighty-four out of the county's two hundred and twenty-four villages had never conducted concluding land reform work. Land certificates had been issued in nineteen villages, truly issued in thirty villages, land reform concluded in fifty villages, and concluding in forty-one villages. Jianping organized thirty-three key villages during this period, with sixteen already completed. Jingxing fully deployed after summarizing the work in key villages on January 25th. Each county plans to strive to largely complete the concluding land reform work before the spring plowing, resolve party-mass relations problems in villages with more serious issues, and lay a good foundation for this year's great production movement.

    From the movement in key villages, the counties mainly achieved the following successes: First, the long-unresolved problem of disunity between new and old cadres was resolved in some villages. According to the analysis of the Xingtang County Committee, there are basically two situations of disunity between new and old cadres: One is the historical clan antagonism within the village. Last year, when organizing "poor peasant groups" to carry out party rectification, it was exploited by clan elements who took the opportunity to infiltrate the poor peasant groups and attack certain party members. On the surface, it appears to be a new-old opposition, but in reality, it is a longer-term clan antagonism. The other is the opposition between the old cadres who were "moved stones" during party rectification and the newly emerged cadres of the "poor peasant groups." The mistakes of the old cadres have not been settled, and they are very dissatisfied after stepping down, often deliberately making things difficult for the new cadres, and deliberately absenting themselves from meetings. Regarding these two situations, Jianping and Xingtang have created good experiences. The main thing is to carry out education on party rectification policies inside and outside the party, discover activists, and carry out criticism and self-criticism movements inside and outside the party. Bad elements who have consistently engaged in factionalism in history and are truly incorrigible are expelled from the party after criticism. Beiye Village in Jianping achieved successful experience in this regard. The issue of new and old cadre relations is also approached by launching criticism. Individual bad elements, whether new or old, who genuinely provoke discord and incite retaliation are given necessary disciplinary actions after criticism and remain unrepentant. In Lianjiazhuang, Xingtang, after launching criticism, the revenge of the new cadre farm association director, as well as past actions such as serving as a puppet village chief and aiding the enemy, were exposed, and he was eventually dismissed. The rift between the new and old cadres was resolved. It must be noted here that disciplinary action alone cannot solve the problem in the central link of launching criticism and self-criticism. Second, in villages where land components have been re-designated, wrongly struggled individuals have been compensated, floating wealth has been distributed, and land certificates have been issued, middle and poor peasants are united, and the production enthusiasm of all classes is high. The situation where wrongly struggled households forced poor peasants to return items in the past has now completely stopped. After the poor peasants consciously compensated the middle peasants in Dongliangma, Gangshan, and other villages in Huolu, the middle peasants said: "We won't hold grudges about the past. Now that the components have been changed, we are one family. As long as we do a good job in production, compensation is a small matter." The Huolu leadership used to worry that some land could not be distributed and the masses did not want it, but after the peasants were enthusiastically mobilized in this concluding land reform, they were not only not worried about distribution, but there was even not enough to distribute. Fifty to eighty mu of land that could not be distributed in Haishan and Nanguyi villages in the past were successfully distributed this time. Peasants in many places are vying to buy land. Third, cadres were trained in the work of key villages. Everyone experienced from actual practice that only through various meetings inside and outside the party, explaining policies, and creating a mass-based movement to conclude land reform can the task be completed quickly and satisfactorily. Dongliangma, Gangshan, and other villages in the seventh district of Huolu all adopted this method, completing registration and measurement in one and a half days, completing the filling out of land certificates in three days, and completing all the concluding land reform work in fourteen days. Conversely, in places such as Gongjiazhuang and Liucun, the land certificates were issued, but the masses' awareness was not raised because they simply relied on old village cadres and failed to mobilize the broad masses.

    From the work in key villages, the following problems in the leadership thinking of some cadres have not been resolved: First, in the party rectification work, they still targeted party members and did not launch criticism against erroneous behaviors and thoughts, but adopted a "kowtow policy." In the party rectification of Nanzhai Village in the ninth district of Huolu, self-criticism and criticism within the party were carried out very superficially. The district cadres convened a mass meeting, and the district cadres said: "Party members have poor work styles, and forced orders require party rectification, but party members have had both merits and hard work in the past. Today, not only will we rectify the party, but we will also rectify the masses!" In this way, the door to criticism was completely closed, and the work could not continue. The Qiubudong working group of Jianping used methods such as inviting party members to smoke, drink tea, and drink wine to invite party members to the meeting because they could not convene a party member meeting. At the party member meeting, the leadership simply admitted mistakes, but did not mention a word about the strange words and obstruction of work by party members. In this way, the village cadres were re-elected perfunctorily, allowing the old cadres to take office, and the problem was not completely resolved. The main reason for this situation is that they were overwhelmed in their thinking by the "lying down" emotions of the party members, thinking that the leadership had been wrong in the past and not believing that right and wrong would be clarified after being guided by the correct party rectification policy. The method of wooing and saying good things replaced the principled struggle, and the result could only make the problem worse. Second, when carrying out compensation and resettlement, they did not mobilize the peasants, especially the poor peasants, but instead, a few cadres handled it single-handedly. This happened in Xijie, Xingtang, and as a result, the poor peasants' emotions were not high after compensation and resettlement. Third, in order to save time and complete the task, they carried out the work with a "let it go" attitude, resulting in a waste of time and energy and the problem could not be solved at all. The counties have raised the above shortcomings in summarizing the experience. At present, the movement in each county has entered the second stage. It is expected that these shortcomings will be corrected and that more complete achievements and experiences will be created.

　　获鹿井陉建屏行唐
  　重点村整党经验
    新老干部问题如何解决的？
  　结束土改的两种做法
    【本报综合讯】察省所属之获鹿、建屏、行唐、井陉等县，均于一月底先后进行总结第一批整党结束土地改革村的工作。这一段运动的时间前后约二十日，各县均以在基点村取得经验并在一般村结束土地改革发土地证为主要目的。行唐在半月内完成的重点村共二十六个，在一般村的结束土地改革工作上，全县三百二十八个村，需要进行结束工作的为一百二十二村，现已解决问题者为六十村。获鹿除组织力量进行重点实验外，全县二百二十四个村中从未进行结束土地改革工作者只有八十四村，已发土地证者为十九村真正发者为三十村，已结束土地改革者为五十村，正结束者四十一村。建屏这一段共组织三十三个重点村，已完成者为十六村。井陉于一月二十五日总结基点村工作后，现已全面展开。各县均计划争取在春耕前大体完成结束土地改革工作，并解决党群关系问题存在较为严重村庄的整党问题，给今年的大生产运动奠定好的基础。
    从基点村的运动中，各县主要取得了以下的成绩：第一是在部分村庄解决了长期所不能解决的新、旧干部的不团结问题；新、旧干部不团结的情形，依据行唐县委的分析，基本上有两种情况：一种是历史上有村内部的宗派对立，去年组织“贫农团”进行整党时，被宗派分子利用，借机钻入贫农团，打击某一部分党员。从表面看是新、旧对立，但从实际看则是较长期性的宗派对立。一种是整党时被搬了“石头”的旧干部与新起来的“贫农团”干部的对立，旧干部的错误未得到清算，下了台很不服劲，常常借故与新干部为难，开会故意不到。对待这两种情况，建屏、行唐都创造了好的经验，主要的是：在党内外进行整党政策的教育，发现积极分子，开展党内外的批评与自我批评运动，对于历史上一贯闹宗派而真正不可救药的坏分子经批评后开除党籍，建屏北冶村在这方面取得了成功的经验。对新、旧干部关系问题，亦是从开展批评入手，对于真正挑拨离间、鼓动报复经批评而仍不觉悟的个别坏分子，无论新、旧均给以必要的纪律处分。行唐连家庄，就是在开展批评后，揭露了新干部中农会主任的报复以及过去当伪村长、资敌等行为，最后给与撤职处分，新、旧干部间的裂痕得到消解。这里必须引起注意的是在开展批评与自我批评是中心环节中单单纪律处分是不能解决问题的。第二是进行了改订成份、补偿错斗、分配浮财，并发了土地证的村庄，中贫农团结，各阶层生产情绪高涨。过去曾经发生过的错斗户强迫贫农退东西的情况，现已完全停止了。获鹿东良麻、岗山等村，在贫农自觉的对中农进行了补偿后，中农表示：“过去的事，咱不记仇，改了成份，成了一家人，只要好好搞生产，补偿是小事情。”获鹿领导上过去曾发愁有些土地分不出去，群众不要，但此次结束土地改革中农民的热情发动起来后，不只不愁分，而且还不够分。海山、南故邑村过去分不出的地有五十至八十亩，这次都顺利地分出去了。许多地方的农民争着买土地。第三是在重点村的工作中锻炼了干部，大家从实际运动中体验到，只有经过党内外的各种会议，说明政策，造成群众性的结束土地改革运动，才能迅速而又完满的完成任务。获鹿七区东良麻、岗山等村，都是采用了这种方法，一天半完成了登记丈量，三内天完成了填写土地证，在十四天的时间内，完成了全部结束土地改革工作。而相反的，在宫家庄、留村等地，因为单纯依靠旧村干不去发动广大群众而失败，土地证虽然发了，群众觉悟没有提高。
    从重点村的工作中看，在部分干部领导思想上还有以下的问题未得到解决：第一是在整党工作中，还就党员，对错误行为与思想不是去开展批评，而是采取了“叩头政策”。获鹿九区南寨村整党，党内自我批评与批评开展得很浮浅，区干部就召集了群众大会，区干部讲话说：“党员作风不好，强迫命令要整党，但党员过去没有功劳也有苦劳，今天不但整党，还要整群众队伍哩！”这样一来，批评的门完全关闭了，工作也无法再继续作下去。建屏秋卜洞工作组因召集不起党员会，便用请党员吸纸烟、喝茶、喝酒等方法请党员到会。在党员会上领导上单纯认错，而对党员讲怪话、阻碍工作等则一字不提，就这样马马虎虎改选村干，让旧干部上台，问题完全没有得到解决。产生这种情况，最主要的是由于在思想上被党员的“躺倒”情绪所压倒，以为过去领导上都错了，不相信经过正确的整党政策的引导，是非就会弄明。用拉拢说好话的办法代替了原则斗争，结果只能把问题弄的更坏。第二是在进行补偿安置时，未在农民中特别是贫农中进行动员，而是由少数干部一手包办，行唐西街即曾发生这样的情形，结果经过补偿安置，贫农情绪反而不高。第三是为了争取时间，完成任务，便以“不了了之”的态度去进行工作，结果是浪费了时间精力而问题完全不能得到解决。以上缺点，各县在总结经验时均已提出，目前各县运动均已进入第二段，预料这些缺点将会得到纠正，并能创造更完满的成绩与经验。（荣士、植庭、王祯、侯永、阎峰、新正、赵伟，本报资料研究室）
