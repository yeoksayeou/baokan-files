TASS, The Hague, February 21st: For several days, the Dutch Parliament has been engaged in intense debate on the Indonesian issue. The General Secretary of the Dutch Communist Party and member of parliament, Groot, demanded during the debate that the government cease its war of aggression against Indonesia. Groot declared: "The government must begin negotiations with Indonesia as soon as possible, but not with the Hatta group or so-called federalists (Dutch puppets), but with the National Front, which is currently leading the guerrilla warfare and has the trust of all the Indonesian people. Negotiations with the National Front must be conditional on recognizing Indonesian independence and withdrawing Dutch troops." Groot pointed out that the Americans want to become the masters of Indonesia with the help of the so-called United Nations Commission for Indonesia. They have also sent military observers to Indonesia. Groot stated that the Dutch troops in Indonesia are now surrounded by guerrillas in the cities. The Dutch working people have already made great sacrifices. Everything must be done to save our people from the abyss. The current government must be replaced by a government that will end this military adventure and sign a peace treaty. Communist Member of Parliament, Hoogakker, stated: "The Drees government is forcing the Dutch army to commit heinous crimes in Indonesia, staining the Dutch people. The war in Indonesia is at the expense of the working people. The wives and children of workers cannot make a living, small farmers are on the verge of bankruptcy, and the middle class is also experiencing increasing difficulties. Strikes protesting high prices are taking place everywhere. The working people demand an immediate end to the war against Indonesia and the withdrawal of Dutch troops."

　　荷共要求荷兰政府停止对印尼的侵略
    【新华社陕北二十五日电】塔斯社海牙二十一日讯：几天以来，荷兰国会在印尼问题上发生剧烈辩论。荷共总书记、众议员格鲁特，在辩论中要求政府停止对印尼的侵略战争。格鲁特宣称：“政府必须尽速开始与印尼谈判，但不是与哈达集团或所谓联邦主义者（荷兰傀儡）谈判，而是与民族阵线谈判，后者现正为首领导游击战争并得全印尼人民的信任。与民族阵线的谈判必须以承认印尼独立、撤退荷军为条件。”格鲁特指出：美国人想借所谓联合国印尼委员会之助，变成印尼的主人。他们又派军事观察员去印尼。格鲁特称：现在印尼境内的荷军，被游击队包围在城市里面。荷兰劳动人民已经付出了重大牺牲。必须尽一切办法拯救我们人民于水火。现政府必须由这样一个政府取而代之，这个政府将结束这一军事冒险，并签订和约。共产党议员霍查克称：德利斯政府正强迫荷兰军队“在印尼犯滔天大罪，沾污荷兰人民。在印尼进行的战争是以牺牲劳动人民为代价的。工人的妻儿无法度日，小农频于破产，而中产阶级也经历着愈来愈大的困难。到处都是抗议物价高昂的罢工。劳动人民要求立即停止对印尼的战争，撤回荷兰军队。”
