　　Without Education or Supervision After Universal Retention

    Baxian Anci Some New Districts
  　Retaining Puppet BaJia Personnel Without Principle
    County Committee Pays Serious Attention and is Inspecting and Correcting
    [Hebei Central Electric] The cadres of the fourth, fifth, and sixth districts of Baxian County and some district cadres of Anci have right-leaning thoughts, one-sidedly emphasizing lenient policies, and failing to distinguish between good and bad among former enemy and puppet personnel, retaining them all to continue "working," allowing some bad people to take the opportunity to raise their heads, disrupting support for the front, seriously wasting manpower, and deliberately creating unbalanced burdens. Relatives and friends of puppet BaJia personnel in Pijiaying Village are generally exempt from labor service. These personnel eat and drink lavishly while "working," but our district cadres turn a blind eye to this situation, only talking about one-sided leniency, and do not educate or control these personnel, let alone expose their crimes. The fifth and sixth districts of Baxian even proposed "removing the labels from enemy and puppet personnel," causing them to strut around and refuse to bow their heads to the masses. Niu Chunlin, the former puppet Lianbao chief of Pijiaying, and others continue to conduct secret activities and hide guns. In Beizhuangtou, Fourth District, a hooligan named Liu, the former puppet Bao chief, is opposed by the villagers. Although the village has our village cadres, the district cadres repeatedly allow him to "work." Ma Biannan, a puppet soldier in Donggoucheng, runs rampant in the village, telling the masses, "I'm back. The district is lenient towards me, see who dares to do anything to me!" Some district cadres in Anci, without distinguishing, allow puppet BaJia personnel to arrange and organize support-the-front committees, so that Bao Chief Han Wannian not only does not deeply repent for his past crimes of relying on the enemy's power to extort and blackmail, but continues to oppress the villagers, telling people, "You say I'm bad, but the district chief thinks I'm good! He asked me to be the director of the support-the-front committee." They are also openly active again, monitoring military dependents and poor masses who are close to us, and undermining our work of confiscating guns from puppet personnel. The district cadres did not promptly expose these sabotage activities, making the bad guys even more active. In the fourth, fifth, and sixth districts of Baxian, in villages where puppet BaJia personnel are allowed to "work," most of the four types of task forces have not been formed. Only honest people and poor military dependents and martyrs' families are made to contribute. In the collection work, the poor masses are always collected from first. Pijiaying, Fifth District, retains the Bao chief to collect grain in three grades: poor peasants take it out first, middle peasants take it out next, and landlords and rich peasants take it out last. The puppet Bao chief of Pijiaying forcibly collected the grain of Chen Baoshan, a poor martyr's family, and reported to the district that Chen Baoshan was "naughty and refused to pay, really lawless, and trying to do whatever he wants." The masses are very dissatisfied with their continued evil deeds and have demanded their replacement. More than 20 people in Gouli Village asked the district chief to replace the puppet Bao chief, but the district chief was afraid that their removal would affect the work. Because our cadres have not realized that this unprincipled "leniency" is a serious mistake of losing the people's stand, they have become detached from the masses. A family member of a cadre who was killed in Nanmeng found the district office; her husband was killed by the puppet Bao chief, and the living have nothing to eat, but the district cadres ignored it. After the cadres entered the new district, they generally dared not approach our families of victims, fearing that they would raise difficulties that could not be answered. The former puppet Bao chief of Sanyingta Village was very bad, and the county committee had already proposed to replace him, but the district cadres did not mobilize and expand the masses, but allowed the puppet BaJia personnel to elect themselves, and as a result, they elected the reserve captain of the puppet Bao chief and others, and made our prisoners who were sentenced to prison become militiamen. The Baxian County Committee and the Anci County Committee have conducted profound self-criticism of the above right-leaning behavior of losing their stand. On the 8th, the Baxian County held a joint meeting of district secretaries and district chiefs to conduct education, and made the following instructions for future work: (1) Correctly implement various policies of the Party, order all returning puppet soldiers and puppet organization personnel to register with the government and conduct education, expose their crimes, and call on them to atone for their crimes in supporting the front. The government must arrest and interrogate those who have guns but do not surrender them and have definite evidence. (2) Adjust the village's support-the-front organization. All puppet BaJia personnel who are disloyal to our support-the-front work or have committed great crimes shall be replaced. (Editor's note: Those with great crimes should be dealt with according to the seriousness of the circumstances.) (3) Improve the support-the-front work, implement work points and clear work, and everyone must attend except those who are exempted from work by the higher authorities. If landlords and rich peasants rely on their power to not attend work, mobilize the masses to report them and settle accounts with them. Those who deliberately fail to attend or refuse to mend their ways after repeated education shall be severely punished. In order to reduce the burden on the masses, stop the village's public meals and prohibit private leave in the village, otherwise it will be regarded as corruption. (4) In conjunction with supporting the front, implement the new district policy, develop the militia, and improve the organization to maintain social order. And pay attention to discovering activists and promoting cadres in supporting the front.

　　一概留用又不加教育与监督
    霸县安次部分新区
  　无原则留用伪保甲人员
    已引起县委严重注意正检查改正中
    【冀中电】霸县四、五、六区干部和安次有些区干部思想右倾，片面强调政策宽大，对前敌伪人员不分别好坏，一律继续留用，让其“办公”，使有些坏人乘机抬头，破坏支前，严重浪费人力，故意使负担不平衡。皮家营村伪保甲人员的亲友概不出差，这些人员在“办公”时大吃大喝，而我区干部对此情况熟视无睹，只讲片面的宽大，对这些人员也不进行教育控制，更没有揭发他们的罪恶。霸县五、六区并提出：“给敌伪人员摘帽子”。因此使他们摇头摆尾，不向群众低头。皮家营前伪联保主任牛春林等还不断进行秘密活动，并隐藏枪支。四区北庄头流氓前伪保长刘某，村里群众都反对他。该村虽有我们的村干部，但区干部仍屡次让他办公。东沟城伪军马变南在村横行，对群众说：“我回来了。区里宽大我，看谁敢把我怎么样呀！”安次有些区干部不加分别的让伪保甲人员布置组织支前委员会，以致保长韩万年对自己过去依仗敌势敲榨勒索的罪行，不但不深自反悔，反继续欺压村民，向人们说：“你们说我不好，区长看着我好着哩！叫我当支前委员会主任。”他们又公开活动起来，监视军属和贫苦群众与我们接近，并破坏我收缴伪人员枪支等工作。这些破坏活动，区干部没有及时揭发，使坏人更加活跃。霸县四、五、六区，凡让伪保甲人员办公的村庄，四种任务队大部没有编成。只让老实人和贫苦军工烈属出力。在征收工作上，同样先征贫苦群众。五区皮家营留用保长征粮分三等，贫苦农民先拿，中农次拿，地主富农后拿。皮家营伪保长，把贫苦烈属陈宝山的粮食强收了去，他们却向区报告说陈宝山“调皮不缴，实是无法无天，妄想为所欲为。”对他们的继续作恶行为，群众甚为不满，纷纷要求予以撤换。沟里村二十多个群众向区长要求撤换伪保长，区长却怕他们下台后影响工作。由于我干部没有认识到这种无原则的“宽大”是丧失人民立场的严重错误，因而脱离群众。南孟一个被杀的干部家属找到区公所，他的男人被伪保长杀了，活着的人没有饭吃。但该区干部却置之不理。干部进入新区后，一般的表现不敢接近我被难家属，怕她们提些困难无法解答。三营塔村前伪保长很坏，县委会已经提出撤换，但区干部却不发动扩大群众，而让伪保甲人员自行选举，结果又把伪保长后备队长等选上了，把我们判了徒刑的犯人当了民兵。霸县县委和安次县委对以上右倾的丧失立场的行为，现已进行了深刻检讨。霸县八日召集区书、区长联席会议进行教育，对今后工作并作了如下的指示：（一）正确贯彻党的各种政策，令回家的伪军伪组织人员一律向政府登记，并进行教育，揭发他们的罪恶，号召他们在支前中戴罪立功。对有枪不缴、有确实证据者，政府必须逮捕审讯。（二）调整村的支前组织。凡对我支前工作不忠实或罪恶大的伪保甲人员，一律撤换。（编者按：罪恶大者应根据情节轻重依法处理。）（三）改进支前工作，实行计工清工，除上级规定免勤者外，一律出勤。地主富农仗势不出勤的，发动群众检举，并与其清帐。对故意不出或屡教不改的，严加处罚。为减轻群众负担，停止村的吃公饭，禁止村中的私自留差，否则以贪污论罪。（四）结合支前，贯彻新区政策，发展民兵，健全组织，以维持社会秩序。并在支前中注意发现积极分子，提拔干部。
