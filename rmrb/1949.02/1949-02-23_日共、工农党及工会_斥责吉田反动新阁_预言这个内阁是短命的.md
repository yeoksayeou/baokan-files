　　Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, February 21st: According to TASS, Tokyo, February 18th: Following the formation of Yoshida's new cabinet, the Japanese Communist Party, Labor-Farmer Party, and trade unions have all denounced the reactionary tendencies of the new cabinet and predicted that it will be short-lived. The Japanese Communist Party announced that it is determined to oppose the reactionary cabinet both within and outside the Diet. The Japanese Communist Party issued a statement on the formation of the new cabinet, in which it predicted that the Democratic Liberal Party would suppress the people in a more brutal manner than previous cabinets. They will reduce wages, implement heavy taxes, increase unemployment, and cause bankruptcies. There is now also a tendency to revise the constitution for the worse. The statement said that the Democratic Liberal Party will establish a "Non-Japanese Activities Investigation Committee" in the form of the "Un-American Activities Committee" and will abolish the Diet's Illegal Property Trading Investigation Committee in order to secretly settle the coal industry bribery case. The Labor-Farmer Party pointed out in its statement that the new cabinet attempts to "sacrifice the interests of the vast majority of farmers, workers, intellectuals, and small merchants in order to protect the interests of a small group of monopoly capitalists." The statement said that workers and farmers will devote themselves to opposing this reactionary cabinet and, for this purpose, mobilize the democratic forces of the country. In addition, representatives of national workers' organizations almost unanimously pointed out the reactionary nature of the new cabinet.
