　　Will Participate in the Atlantic Alliance?
    The Soviet Union Asks the Norwegian Government to Clarify its Position
    Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, February 3rd: According to a TASS report from Oslo: On January 29th, Soviet Ambassador to Norway, Afanasyev, visited the Secretary-General of the Norwegian Ministry of Foreign Affairs, Hielsstad, and issued a statement which read in part: In view of the news that has been published in newspapers regarding Norway's intention to participate in the Atlantic Alliance, the Soviet Government has authorized me to make the following statement. Based on many existing facts, the so-called Atlantic Alliance is about to be established. The Soviet government has sufficient grounds to determine that the initiators of the Atlantic Pact are attempting to use this new international group to establish naval and air bases around the world, especially in territories close to the Soviet Union. The Soviet government reminds the Norwegian government of this situation, that the Atlantic Group is a group of countries that is in fact confronting the United Nations, and that the goals it is pursuing are not at all in line with the interests of consolidating peace. In view of all of the above, especially considering the fact that Norway and the Soviet Union share a common border, the Soviet government requests the Norwegian government to clarify its position on the Atlantic Pact. The Soviet government requests the Norwegian government to inform the Soviet Union whether the reports in the press stating that Norway is participating in the Atlantic Alliance are consistent with reality, and whether the Norwegian government is undertaking obligations regarding the establishment of naval and air bases on Norwegian territory as part of the Atlantic Alliance.
    Hielsstad promised to bring the Soviet statement to the attention of the Norwegian government.

　　是否将参加大西洋联盟？
    苏联要求挪威政府表明立场
    【新华社陕北三日电】据塔斯社奥斯陆讯：一月二十九日，苏联驻挪威大使阿凡纳西斯访问挪威外交部秘书长希尔斯塔德，发表声明略称：鉴于报纸已经刊登有关挪威意欲参加大西洋联盟的消息，苏联政府已授权给我作如下的声明。根据许多现有的事实，所谓大西洋联盟即将成立。苏联政府有足够的根据断定，大西洋公约的发起人，正试图利用这一新的国际集团，以便在世界各地特别是在紧靠苏联各国的领土上建立海空军基地。苏联政府提醒挪威政府注意这一情事，大西洋集团是这样一种国家集团，它事实上正与联合国相抗衡，它正在追求的目的，与巩固和平的利益毫不相同。鉴于上述一切，尤其是考虑到挪威与苏联有着共同的疆界这一情况，因此苏联政府要求挪威政府表明对大西洋公约的立场。苏联政府要求挪威政府通知苏联是否报上所载挪威正参加大西洋联盟的报导与实际相符，是否挪威政府正对大西洋联盟承担关于在挪威领土上建立海空军基地的各项义务。
    希尔斯塔德允诺使苏联的声明为挪威政府所注意。
