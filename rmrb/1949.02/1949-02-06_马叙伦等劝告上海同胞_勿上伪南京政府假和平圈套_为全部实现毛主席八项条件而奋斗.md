Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 4th: Ma Xulun, Sha Qianli, Shen Zhiyuan, Wang Shao'ao, Xu Guangping, Luo Shuzhang, and other six directors of the Shanghai People's Organizations Joint Association, jointly issued a letter to Shanghai compatriots on the 3rd of this month. The full text is as follows:

Shanghai compatriots from all walks of life:

The annual Spring Festival is coming again. We are Ma Xulun, Sha Qianli, Shen Zhiyuan, Wang Shao'ao, Xu Guangping, Luo Shuzhang, and other directors of the Shanghai People's Organizations Joint Association, and we extend our New Year greetings to you from the distant liberated areas of the north:

Fellow compatriots: Since the Kuomintang reactionary army was completely and thoroughly annihilated in the Northeast battlefield recently, more than one million have been eliminated, surrendered, or accepted reorganization in the Huaihai, Tianjin and other war zones. At this point, the elite main force of Chiang Kai-shek's bandit army has been wiped out. Therefore, the Nanjing reactionary regime, which everyone hates, has indeed reached the point of collapse.

Seeing that he had been completely defeated militarily, Chiang Kai-shek issued a message on New Year's Day, expressing his desire for "peace" and trying to preserve his remaining reactionary forces through political conspiracies. But at the same time, he also attempted to lightly shift the responsibility for creating civil war and destroying peace from his own shoulders to the Communist Party.

However, everyone with eyes and conscience can see very clearly that all the actions of the Chinese Communist Party today represent and accurately reflect the public opinion of the entire Chinese people. Just look at the eight peace conditions in Chairman Mao Zedong's statement on the current situation on January 14 to know.

Chiang Kai-shek, this public enemy of the people, saw that his deceptive tricks had not succeeded, and he was forced to pretend to "retire" and ran back to his old nest in Fenghua to act as the behind-the-scenes host. He allowed Li Zongren, the pseudo-vice president and No. 2 war criminal who was brought to the stage by the American imperialists, to "replace" him. Li Zongren sent his personal representatives Gan Jiehou, Shao Lizi, Zhang Zhizhong, and others to travel between Shanghai and Nanjing, spreading a smoke screen of peace to achieve another conspiracy of this reactionary regime. At the same time, the Kuomintang government continued to transfer troops and gather in Jiangnan and Zhejiang, Fujian, Jiangxi, Hunan, Guangdong, Taiwan, and other places, and was still training dozens of divisions, making plans to make a comeback.

On January 22 of this year, we, the people who uphold the truth and love democracy and freedom, issued opinions on the current situation, with Li Jishen, Shen Junru, Ma Xulun, Guo Moruo, and other 55 people as signatories; and on January 26 and 27, the China Democratic League, the China Association for Promoting Democracy, the Zhi Gong Party, the China National Salvation Association, and the Chinese Peasants and Workers Democratic Party and other democratic parties issued statements, all of which strongly supported Mr. Mao's statement. People from all walks of life, especially compatriots in Shanghai, have deeply felt the pain of the cruel oppression of the four major families, bureaucratic capital, and American imperialism. In the three years since the victory of the Anti-Japanese War, in factories, schools, and business circles, they have constantly encountered arrest, beatings, killings, forced closures, and layoffs. Those who are fortunate enough to barely maintain themselves today are also in a terrible state and in a situation where they cannot survive. However, Chiang Kai-shek, the war criminal and public enemy of the people, still shamelessly and heartlessly asked us in his New Year's Day message to preserve his pseudo-constitution, pseudo-legal system, and his reactionary army, and regarded his driving the people to the "special criminal court," to disappearance and death, and large-scale detention in concentration camps a hundred times more miserable than hell as a "free way of life," and drove hundreds of millions of people to the brink of hunger and unemployment, and he said he would "maintain" this "minimum standard of living." Is this something that the Chinese people are willing to accept?

Dear Shanghai compatriots, you have heard about the experiences of your relatives and friends on the ships stranded in Rongcheng Bay, and you have also heard about the rapid recovery of industry and commerce and the short-term resumption of classes in schools after the recovery of Jinan, and you are longing to see this "paradise on earth" in the liberated areas with your own eyes. Now we can guarantee that since we came to the liberated areas, what we have seen and heard is increased production and peaceful life. There is no corruption here, no exploitation by feudal landlords and bureaucratic capitalists, the people are not threatened by death, and they do not have the situation of not knowing what will happen tomorrow. We have truly entered a "paradise on earth." Compatriots, this paradise is not unattainable, and we have a way to make all the people of China enjoy it. Just follow the expectations below:

In the liberated areas, the statements of various democratic groups and parties all agree that under the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party, true and lasting peace can be achieved in accordance with Mr. Mao's eight peace conditions. The statements issued by the 55 democratic figures who have arrived in the liberated areas one after another can represent the opinions of the China Democratic League, the China Association for Promoting Democracy, the China National Salvation Association, the Chinese Peasants and Workers Democratic Party, the Zhi Gong Party, and the progressive factions of the Kuomintang, as well as non-party and non-factional democratic figures. It is firmly believed that the people of Shanghai and the wise democratic figures from all walks of life will be able to respond to this statement and will not be confused by the smoke screen of peace released by war criminals such as Li Zongren and Sun Ke. Everyone must know that the peace tricks of Li Zongren and Sun Ke are directed behind the scenes by American imperialism and Chiang Kai-shek, and are coordinated with Chiang Kai-shek's active military deployments in Southeast, South China, Taiwan and other regions. Chiang Kai-shek retreated behind the scenes to concentrate on continuing to prepare for war, and ordered Li Zongren, Sun Ke and others to stand on the stage to stage their "peace" farce, attempting to slow down the pursuit of the People's Liberation Army and divide and shake the unity of the people's democratic front. In this way, Chiang Kai-shek will have time to calmly arrange his counter-revolutionary military affairs.

Shanghai compatriots, you must strengthen your will and extend your iron fists to resolutely and ruthlessly smash the peace conspiracy presided over by Li Zongren, Sun Ke, and others. We must know that Li Zongren, Sun Ke and others are also first-class war criminals! They have recently been constantly sending Shao Lizi, Zhang Zhizhong, Gan Jiehou, and others to Shanghai to carry out activities, attempting to lure Shanghai social figures into their reactionary trap. We hereby solemnly inform these people that anyone who falls into their trap, regards their "peace" as true peace, and speaks up for them, will hinder the great cause of people's liberation, that is, hinder the realization of true, complete, and lasting peace. And they themselves will become sinners of the people's democratic cause.

Shanghai compatriots, we are here to make a special appeal to you with the highest enthusiasm, hoping that you will bravely and resolutely unite, respond to the recent statements on the current situation by democratic figures and various democratic parties in the liberated areas, and strive for the full realization of Mr. Mao's eight peace conditions.

### 马叙伦等劝告上海同胞　勿上伪南京政府假和平圈套  为全部实现毛主席八项条件而奋斗

　　马叙伦等劝告上海同胞
  　勿上伪南京政府假和平圈套
    为全部实现毛主席八项条件而奋斗
    【新华社陕北四日电】上海人民团体联合会理事马叙伦、沙千里、沈志远、王绍鏊、许广平、罗淑章等六人，于本月三日联名发表告上海同胞书。全文如下：上海各界同胞们：
    一年一度的春节又到来了。我们是上海人民团体联合会的理事马叙伦、沙千里、沈志远、王绍鏊，许广平，罗淑章等，现在从遥远的北方的解放区，向你们祝贺年禧：
    诸位同胞：最近国民党反动军队从东北战场被全部彻底歼灭以来，接连又在淮海平津等战区被消灭，或投降或接受改编的，达一百余万。到此，蒋介石匪军的精锐主力已被消灭干净了。因而人人痛恶的南京反动派政权，确已到了土崩瓦解的绝境。
    蒋介石眼见军事上已经彻底失败了，乃于元旦发出文告，表示要“和平”，想借政治阴谋来保存他的残余的反动力量。但同时又企图把制造内战破坏和平的责任，从自己的肩膀上轻轻地推卸到共产党身上去。
    殊不知今天中国共产党的一切行动，凡是有眼睛有良心的人都看得很清楚，它无一不代表了而且确切地反映了全中国人民的公意。只要看一月十四日中共中央主席毛泽东先生时局声明中的八项和平条件，便可知道。
    蒋介石这个人民公敌，看见了自己的欺骗鬼计没有成功，万分不得己，而假装“引退”，跑回老巢奉化，做幕后主持人。让那个美帝国主义者一手捧上台的伪副总统第二号战犯李宗仁来“代”他。李宗仁派他的私人代表甘介侯及邵力子、张治中等，奔走沪宁之间，散布和平烟幕，来达到这反动政权的另一阴谋。同时国民党政府则继续调兵遣将，聚集于江南及浙江、福建、江西、湖南、广东、台湾各地，还在编练几十个师，作卷土重来的计划。
    在本年一月廿二日，我们拥护真理爱好民主自由的人士，由李济深、沈钧儒、马叙伦、郭沫若等五十五人具名的对时局意见；及一月二十六日、廿七日民主同盟，中国民主促进会，致公党，中国人民救国会和农工农主党等民主党派的声明，都是一致拥护毛先生声明的强有力的表示。我们各界人士，尤其在上海的同胞，以前深深感受到四大家族、官僚资本以及美帝国主义的残酷压迫的痛苦。抗日胜利后，三年来，在工厂，在学校，在工商界都不断的遇到被捕、被打、被杀、被迫休业、被解雇。其侥幸而勉强维持到今天的，亦已狼狈不堪，陷于无法生存之境地，而战犯兼人民公敌的蒋介石，在他元旦文告里却还不知羞耻丧尽天良地叫我们替他保存那伪宪法、伪法统和他的反动军队，并且把他的驱迫人民投向“特种刑庭”、投向失踪死亡，及大批拘禁于比地狱更惨百倍的集中营，当作是“自由的生活方式”，把亿万人民赶向饥饿失业线上，他说还要“维持”这种“最低生活水准”。难道这是中国人民甘心情愿领受的吗？
    亲爱的上海同胞们，你们曾经听到过荣成湾搁浅的船上的亲友们的经历，又曾听到过济南收复后工商业的迅速恢复，学校的短期复课，而不胜向往，极愿亲眼看到这解放区的“人间天堂”。现在我们可以保证，我们先后来到解放区，目见耳闻，都是增加生产，安居乐业。这里没有贪污，没有封建地主和官僚资本家的剥削，人民没有死亡的威胁，没有今日不知明日的遭遇。我们真真走到“人间天堂”里了。同胞们，这天堂并不是高不可登，我们有法子使得全中国的人民都享受得到。只要遵照下面的期望做去。
    在解放区里，各民主团体党派人士的声明，大家公认是在中国共产党领导之下，依照毛先生的八项和平条件，一定可以达到真正的持久的和平。现时先后到了解放区的五十五个民主人士发表的声明，可以代表中国民主同盟、中国民主促进会、中国人民救国会、中国农工民主党、致公党、和国民党进步的各派，以及无党无派的民主人士的意见。深信我上海的人民和贤明的各界民主人士，一定能够响应这一声明，不会被目前李宗仁、孙科这些战犯们所施放的和平烟幕所迷惑。大家要知道，李宗仁、孙科的和平把戏，是受着美帝国主义和蒋介石在幕后指挥的，而且是和蒋介石在东南、华南、台湾等地区的积极的军事布置相配合的。蒋介石退到幕后来专心致力于继续作战的布置，叫李宗仁、孙科之流站到舞台前面来大演其“和平”丑剧，企图缓和人民解放军的追击、及分化与动摇人民民主阵线的团结。这样，就好让蒋介石有时间去从容布置他的反革命军事。
    上海的同胞们，必须要坚定自己的意志，伸出自己的铁拳，来坚决无情地粉碎李宗仁、孙科等所主持的和平阴谋。我们要知道李宗仁、孙科等人也是头等战争罪犯呀！他们最近不断派邵力子、张治中、甘介侯等到上海来活动，企图引诱上海的社会人士，来上他们的反动圈套。我们特此严正奉告这些人士，谁要是上了他们的圈套，把他们所搞的“和平”，当作真和平看，而且替他们奔走帮腔，那就妨害了人民解放的大事业，亦即妨害了真正、彻底、持久和平的实现。而自己也就变成了人民民主事业的罪人。
    上海同胞们，我们在这里特地以最高的热忱向你们提出呼吁，希望你们勇敢地坚决地团结起来，响应最近解放区民主人士及各民主党派的时局声明，为全部实现毛先生的八项和平条件而奋斗。
