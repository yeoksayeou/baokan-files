Brief News

To: Offices of Party Committees, Prefectural Committees, and County Committees in all districts; Offices of Administrative Offices, Prefectural Administrative Offices, and County Governments at all levels:

    The annual production plans and spring plowing production plans of various regions have been formulated one after another. The materials we have received so far include: the Sixth Administrative Office of Taihang, the Fifth Administrative Office of Beiyue, the Party Committee and Fifth Administrative Office of the Jinnan District, and Tunliu County of Taiyue, among other locations.

    These materials are of great help to us in understanding the overall situation of agricultural and industrial production. We hope that counties and units in various regions that have not yet sent these materials will send them as quickly as possible. We plan to compile these materials and publish excerpts in the newspaper. This will be of great help in exchanging experiences and promoting this year's production campaign.

                                                                  The Newspaper's Archives Department

    各地全年生产计划及春耕生产计划，均已先后订出，我们现在已收到的计有：太行六专署、北岳五专署、冀南区党委及五专署、太岳的屯留县等地的材料。
    这些材料，对我们了解全面的农工业生产概况有极大帮助，希各地尚未送来此材料的县份及单位，能迅速掷寄，愈快愈好，我们准备将这些材料加以整理在报纸上摘要发表，如此，对交流经验与推动今年生产运动上是有极大帮助的。
