　　Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, February 21st: TASS, Moscow, February 18th: While the fields in central and northern Soviet Union are still covered with deep snow, field work in the southern Soviet Union has already begun. In Uzbekistan, Turkmenistan, Tajikistan and other Central Asian and Transcaucasian republics, spring sowing is underway in dozens of regions. Collective farmers are sowing summer wheat, barley, alfalfa, and flax. The sown area of these crops has already increased. While carrying out spring sowing, collective farmers are also busy tending to winter crops. To ensure a bumper harvest of cotton, tea, and rice, collective farmers are deeply plowing the fields and dredging irrigation canals.
　　Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, February 21st: According to TASS, Moscow: Workers at the Dnieper Hydroelectric Power Plant, one of the largest hydroelectric power stations in the Soviet Union, located on the Dnieper River in Ukraine, have completed the massive project of repairing the fourth 60,000-kilowatt generating unit and have been awarded by Stalin. Stalin's congratulatory letter expressed confidence that they would "put another two units of equal power into operation in 1949, with the first one going into operation before the spring flood." Stalin's letter was in response to a letter from the personnel of the Dnieper Hydroelectric Power Plant construction project. They had written to Stalin to report that the first part of the Dnieper Hydroelectric Power Plant, named after Lenin, which had been repaired by the Dnieper Hydroelectric Power Plant construction project, had been normally ensuring the power supply to the industry in the Dnieper River basin and the Donets Coalfield, and had supplied a large amount of electricity at low cost, saving 1.1 million tons of coal for other sectors of the national economy. In accordance with the task you assigned of completely restoring the Dnieper Hydroelectric Power Plant, we worked hard throughout 1948 to ensure the rapid restoration of the second part. The complete set of high-power hydroelectric generating units manufactured by Soviet factories has been installed by the personnel of the Dnieper Hydroelectric Power Plant construction project in a short period of time and put into operation on New Year's Eve of 1948. The quality of this generating unit greatly exceeds that of the generating units delivered by American companies.

　　苏联南部春季播种已开始
  　德聂伯发电厂完成第四套发电装置
    【新华社陕北二十一日电】塔斯社莫斯科十八日讯：当苏联中部与北部地区的田野仍盖着深厚积雪的时候，苏联南部的田间工作业已开始。在乌兹贝克、土库曼、塔吉克斯坦及其他中亚细亚与外高加索共和国的几十个地区，春季播种工作已在进行中。集体农民正在播种夏季小麦、大麦、苜蓿和亚麻等。这些农作物的播种面积业已增加。集体农民一面进行春季播种，一面忙着照料冬季作物。集体农民们为保证棉花、茶叶与大米的丰收，正在深耕田地和疏通灌溉运河。
    【新华社陕北二十一日电】据塔斯社莫斯科讯：苏联最大水电站之一、乌克兰德聂伯河上的德聂伯发电厂工人，已修复了第四套发电六千万千瓦的发电装置的巨大工程，并获得斯大林的嘉奖。斯大林的祝贺信确信他们能“在一九四九年使有同等电力的另两套装置开工发电，其中第一套在春季洪水到来前开工”。斯大林的信是答复德聂伯发电厂建筑工程处的人员的。他们曾写信给斯大林报告工作称：以列宁为名的德聂伯发电厂，其已由德聂伯发电厂建筑工程处修复的第一部分，已正常地保证着对德聂伯河流域的工业及顿尼兹煤田的电力供应，并且已以低廉成本供应大量电力，为别的国民经济部门节省了一百一十万吨煤。遵奉您所指定完全修复德聂伯发电厂的任务，我们在一九四八年全年始终努力工作，以保证迅速修复第二部分。苏联工厂自制的整套高电力水力发电装置，已经德聂伯发电厂建筑工程处的人员在短时间内装置完毕，并在一九四八年除夕开工发电。这套发电装置的品质大大超过美国公司交来的发电装置。
