Xinhua News Agency, Tianjin, February 4th: Since liberation, workers and staff in Tianjin's factories have been enthusiastically studying new cultural and political knowledge to improve their cultural and political levels. All employees of the Tianjin No. 2 Factory of the North China Iron and Steel Company now study culture and the various policies of the Chinese Communist Party and the People's Government from 3:00 PM to 4:00 PM every day. Workers at the Tianjin Tram Management Office study in shifts for one hour before work each day. Staff from the Tianjin Office of the Preparatory Committee of the North China Federation of Trade Unions explain the CCP and People's Government's current policies to them and answer various questions raised by the workers. Workers and staff of the No. 3 Factory of the China Textile Company and the Tianjin No. 1 Factory of the Central Machine Works discuss problems and study through symposiums. All workers of the No. 1 Machinery Factory of the China Textile Company, except for a portion who are working hard to repair the houses damaged by the Kuomintang bandit troops, are studying in groups. Railway workers at the Tianjin East Railway Station are eagerly borrowing propaganda pamphlets about the CCP and the People's Government's policies and studying them carefully. Such a conscious and enthusiastic learning situation among workers and staff in Tianjin factories was unprecedented and impossible during the rule of the Kuomintang bandit gang. Through learning, they realize that they are the masters of the new society, and not only have their thoughts begun to change, but their enthusiasm for labor has also greatly increased. One person from the Dongya Flour Mill said, "In the past, I wanted to play cards whenever I had free time, but now it's different. I always want to read more books from the old liberated areas and understand the Communist Party's policies." Workers at the Tianjin Telecommunications Bureau said, "In the new society, we are doing things for ourselves. Understanding the policies will help us do better." Some workers in the Electrical Department of the No. 6 Factory of the China Textile Company put forward the slogan "Resume work without lagging behind, and establish a new attitude towards labor" during their studies. While studying, many factory workers are organizing music teams, Yangko dance teams, and Ping Opera societies to celebrate the first Spring Festival after the liberation of Tianjin.
    Xinhua News Agency, Tianjin, February 2nd: In order to develop and lead the Tianjin workers' movement, the Tianjin Office of the Preparatory Committee of the North China Federation of Trade Unions was officially established recently, with Li Jiebo and Qiu Jin serving as the director and deputy director respectively. The office has sent working groups to various state-owned enterprises and factories to mobilize workers to assist the military control commission in taking over and actively organizing the resumption of work, and to help workers in various units to exchange gold yuan notes and other matters related to worker welfare.

　　积极提高政治文化水平
  　天津职工热烈学习政策
    华北总工会筹委会津市办事处成立
    【新华社天津四日电】解放以后的天津各工厂的工人、职员们，正在热烈地学习新的文化和政治知识，以提高文化水平和政治水平。华北钢铁公司天津第二厂的全体职工，现在每天下午三点到四点，分别学习文化和中国共产党、人民政府的各项政策。天津市电车管理处的工人们，每天在上工以前，分班学习一小时，并由华北总工会筹备委员会天津办事处的工作人员，向他们讲解中共和人民政府当前的各项政策，随时解答工人所提出的各种问题。中纺公司第三厂和中央机器厂天津第一厂的工人、职员，则用座谈会的方式，讨论问题，进行学习。中纺公司第一机械厂的全体工人，除了一部分正在努力修理被国民党匪军破坏的房屋外，其余都在分组学习。天津东车站的铁路职工们，大家争先恐后地向人借阅有关中共和人民政府各项政策的宣传小册子，仔细研读。天津各工厂工人职员这种自觉的热烈学习的情形，在国民党匪帮统治时代，是不曾有过也不可能有的现象。他们在学习中认识到自己是新社会的主人，不仅思想上开始起了变化，而且劳动热情也大为提高。东亚面粉厂的一个人说：“我过去一有空就想打牌，现在可不同了，总想多看看老解放区的书，明白明白共产党的政策。”天津电讯局的工人们说：“在新社会中，咱们是给自己办事情，懂得了政策，就会办得更好。”中纺公司第六厂电气部的一部分工人，在学习中提出了“复工不落后，建立新的劳动态度”的口号。在进行学习的同时，不少工厂的职工们正在组织音乐队，秧歌队，平戏社等文化娱乐活动，以欢度天津解放后的第一个春节。
    【新华社天津二日电】为开展与领导天津市职工运动，华北总工会筹委会天津办事处已于日前正式成立，由李颉伯、丘金分任正副主任。该办事处已派出工作小组分赴各公营企业工厂，一面发动职工协助军管会进行接管并积极组织复工，一面帮助各单位职工进行兑换金圆券及其他有关职工福利事宜。
