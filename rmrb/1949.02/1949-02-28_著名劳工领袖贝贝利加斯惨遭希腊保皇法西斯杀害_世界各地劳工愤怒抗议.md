Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, February 26th: Reports from various sources indicate that working people around the world are vehemently protesting the atrocities committed by the American imperialist stooges, the Greek Royalist Fascists, in murdering Bebelis, the General Secretary of the Greek General Confederation of Labor.

　　When World Federation of Trade Unions General Secretary Saillant held a press conference in Paris on the 21st, he issued a statement regarding Bebelis's murder, stating that the tragic death of this prominent trade union leader has aroused deep anger among members of the World Federation of Trade Unions. Saillant said he has telegraphed the Secretary-General of the United Nations to protest Bebelis's murder. The telegram also urges trade unions around the world to support the protests of the World Federation of Trade Unions.

　　The Soviet Trade Union Central Organ newspaper, "Labor Daily," wrote: The murder of Bebelis should not be regarded as an isolated crime by the Athens authorities. Under the direction of their American and British masters, Sophoulis and Tsaldaris are seeking to suppress the democratic movement in Greece, physically eliminating the best sons and daughters of the people, eliminating the tested fighters for the cause of the working class. "Labor Daily" strongly stated that the Greek people will unite more closely around the Democratic Army and the glorious Communist Party to respond to the new crimes of the Athens executioners.

　　British Communist Party General Secretary Pollitt issued a statement regarding the news of Bebelis's murder, stating that this "is a new and urgent call to British trade union members, calling on them to redouble their efforts to end the American and British military occupation of Greece that allows this barbaric puppet government to be maintained, and to fully support the struggle of the Greek democratic and trade union movement." White, General Secretary of the British Civil Service Association, which has 140,000 members, and Jacob, Secretary of the Executive Bureau of the London Trades Council, which has 600,000 members, both expressed outrage at the new atrocities of the Greek Royalist Fascists.

　　Regarding Bebelis's murder, Italian General Confederation of Labor General Secretary Vittorio, on behalf of seven million members, sent a telegram to the Greek reactionary government to express protest.

　　The American Committee for Aid to Democratic Greece sent letters to Truman, Acheson, the President of the United Nations General Assembly, the Secretary-General, and others, protesting Bebelis's murder.

　　Factories and workshops in Bucharest, the capital of Romania, held mass rallies to protest the murder of Bebelis. Grozos, one of the Greek trade union leaders, declared at a rally held at the Railway Workers' Grand Theater: "The Greek people will not stop fighting until they drive the last aggressor out of the country."

    英共总书记波立特就贝贝利加斯遇害的消息发表声明称：这“对于英国工会会员们是一个新的紧急号召，号召他们加倍努力，以便结束这个野蛮的傀儡政府得以维持的美英对希腊的军事占领，以便充分支持希腊民主和工会运动的斗争”。拥有会员十四万人的英国公务员协会总书记怀特及拥有会员六十万人的伦敦工会委员会执行局书记贾可伯，均对希腊保皇法西斯的新暴行表示愤慨。
    为贝贝利加斯被害事，意大利总工会总书记维特瑞奥代表七百万会员致电希腊反动政府，表示抗议。
    美国援助民主希腊委员会分别致函杜鲁门、艾奇逊及联合国大会主席、秘书长等，对贝贝利加斯被害表示抗议。
    罗马尼亚首都布加勒斯特的工厂与作坊举行抗议谋杀贝贝利加斯的群众大会。希腊职工会领袖之一的格罗佐斯在铁路员工大戏院举行的一个大会上宣称：“希腊人民在把最后一个侵略者驱逐出境之前将不停止战斗。”
