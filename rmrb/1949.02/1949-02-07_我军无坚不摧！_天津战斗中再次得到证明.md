Xinhua News Agency, Tianjin Front, 29th: (Delayed) The People's Liberation Army's artillery and engineers, in coordination with the infantry, spent two hours on the morning of the 14th breaking through the solid fortifications of the Chiang Kai-shek bandits on the outskirts of Tianjin, planting the flag of freedom on Tianjin city, once again demonstrating their invincible and powerful might. The Kuomintang authorities, under the slogan of "Great Tianjin Fortress," plundered countless assets from the people and consumed a large amount of their labor, building extensive fortifications inside and outside Tianjin city in an attempt to block the People's Liberation Army. The outer ring of fortifications alone included several lines of obstacles such as chevaux-de-frise, caltrops, and barbed wire (some electrified), as well as an outer moat tens of miles long, two zhang wide and two zhang deep; along the moat was a wall one zhang high and one zhang five chi wide; under the wall were densely packed hidden bunkers; there were also dozens of outer strongholds and a minefield with more than 40,000 mines. On the evening of the 13th, one artillery vehicle after another of the People's Liberation Army drove towards the position in the blowing sand, and tens of thousands of infantrymen approached the city walls along winding communication trenches, reaching areas about 200 meters from the walls. They waited quietly for the artillery and engineers to level the obstacles and open the road to advance into the city. At 9:00 a.m. on the 14th, the artillerymen, with the confidence of hitting every target, fired the first shell. The whistling sound pierced the sky, and as the thick smoke rose, an enemy bunker on the wall was shattered. The infantry, eager to advance, burst into cheers. Then, the People's Liberation Army's artillery roared in unison. The Third Company of the "East Sea Unit" artillery regiment fired sixty shells in one breath, each hitting its target, and the enemy's firepower was suppressed into silence. After a fierce bombardment of forty minutes, a large gap appeared in the wall fortifications that the Tianjin Chiang bandits relied on for protection. The artillery fire then turned to the flanks and depth, and the heroic engineers moved out in the dense smoke. They quickly surveyed the minefield, cleared the mine boundary, and demolitionists leveled the barbed wire one after another. A combat team of a certain unit successfully blew up five times in a row. After Teng Qingyuan, a member of the team, blew up the last hidden bunker outside the breach, the flag bearer Yang Wenyi and several other comrades flew over the moat, bravely climbed the city, and planted the flag of victory on Tianjin city. The enemy's solid outer fortifications were thus breached. At this time, it was 11:00 a.m., only two hours after the start of the artillery bombardment. Subsequently, the follow-up troops surged into the city and destroyed all the enemy's fortifications in the city within more than twenty hours, completing the liberation of Tianjin.

　　我军无坚不摧！
  　天津战斗中再次得到证明
    【新华社平津前线二十九日电】（迟到）人民解放军的炮兵和工兵协同步兵，十四日上午以两个钟头的时间，突破天津外围蒋匪的坚固工事，把自由的旗帜插在天津城上，再度表现了无坚不摧的强大威力。国民党当局在“大天津堡垒化”的口号下，掠夺了人民无数的资财，消耗了人民大量的劳力，在天津城内外大修工事，企图阻挡人民解放军。单是城外的环城工事，除鹿砦、梅花桩、铁丝网（一部分通电流）等数道障碍外，还有一道长达数十里、两丈宽两丈深的外壕；沿壕又筑了一丈高、一丈五尺宽的围墙；围墙下面，暗堡密布；又有外围据点的子母碉数十个和埋有地雷四万多个的布雷区。十三日晚，解放军的炮车一辆又一辆地在风沙飞扬中开向阵地，成万的步兵则沿着弯曲的交通壕逼近城垣，直抵离围墙约二百米的地区。他们沉静地等待着炮兵和工兵平毁障碍，开辟进军市内的道路。十四日晨九时，炮兵们怀着百发百中的信心发出了第一颗炮弹，啸声穿过天空，浓烟起处，围墙上敌人的一个碉堡粉碎了。急待前进的步兵们发出一片喝采的呼声。接着，解放军的大炮一齐轰鸣，“东海部”炮兵团第三连一气打了六十发炮弹，弹弹命中了目标，敌人的火力被压制得没有声息了。在猛烈轰击了四十分钟之后，天津蒋匪恃为护身符的围墙工事，出现了一道大大的缺口。炮火随即转向两翼和纵深射击，英勇的工兵在浓烟弥漫中出动了。他们迅速地探查了布雷区，扫清了雷界，爆破手一道又一道地平毁着铁丝网。某部一连战斗组连续爆破五次成功。当该组组员滕庆元把突破口外敌人最后的一个暗堡也炸得粉碎之后，旗手杨文易和其他几个同志，飞步越过护城河奋勇登城，把胜利的旗帜插到天津城上。敌人的坚固的外围工事就此被突破了。此时是十一点钟，距开始炮轰时才两小时。接着后续部队潮涌入城，在二十余小时内摧毁了市内敌人的一切工事，完成了天津的解放。
