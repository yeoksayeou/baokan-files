　　A Pair of Foreign Socks
　　--A Small Story of Military-Civilian Relations in the New District

　　Wangtun is very close to Xinxiang. Chiang Kai-shek's bandit gangs constantly came here to rob grain and seize men for the army, so the common people were constantly frightened and hid everywhere. No one dared to leave anything out in the open. On November 23rd, the People's Liberation Army stationed here. Many people were not yet familiar with the PLA, so they were frightened and hid for a while. Later, they saw that the PLA was very disciplined, so those who had hidden came out, and those who had hidden their things dug them up. The landlady of the third squad of the first platoon also thought about taking out a pair of foreign socks that she had hidden under a stone. But when she lifted the stone, she found it was empty inside. At this time, the soldier Peng Defu was boiling water in the kitchen. She thought that this soldier must have stolen them, or at least he must know who stole them. The New Year was coming soon, and the socks were gone, so she became anxious and shouted, "Who took my socks?" The soldier Peng Defu explained, "We are the People's Liberation Army, and we don't take a single needle or thread from the masses. Have you forgotten where you put them?"
　　"I haven't forgotten! They were placed under the stone!"
　　"Did your child take them?"
　　"I don't have any children!"
　　"We wouldn't take them. Why don't you look for them patiently!" Peng Defu said patiently, but the landlady became impatient and didn't want to listen anymore. She said, "My socks can't fly away. You're here starting the fire! Anyway, you have to know." After saying that, she turned around and walked away, returning to her room, muttering and cursing: "Stealing things, bandits...".
　　The landlady's shouting attracted a crowd to the courtyard. Squad Leader Yu Hanli was in a difficult position. He repeatedly questioned each comrade, and they all said in unison: "I didn't take them." Squad Leader Yu was familiar with the personality and style of each comrade, and he believed their answers. But the landlady's socks could not be found, and this unclear situation would have a bad impact. Therefore, he decided to ask the comrades to bring out all their belongings and ask the masses in the courtyard to conduct a thorough inspection. This action moved the onlookers in the courtyard: some soldiers hadn't even unpacked their bags, and several old women stepped forward to stop them. They shouted, "Don't unpack them! Don't unpack them! Our army is not that army (referring to the Chiang bandits)." Another old woman patted her chest and said, "Our army is kind-hearted and wouldn't do that (referring to taking things)." Just then, the landlady ran out of the kitchen in a panic, waving the socks in her hand and saying, "Don't unpack them, I found them! They were hidden in the bellows. It's my fault for misremembering the place!" The soldiers' hearts seemed to drop a stone, and they packed up their bags again, but the masses began to discuss it. Some said, "Fortunately, it's the People's Liberation Army. If it were the 40th Division (Chiang bandits), they would have beaten her to death, wouldn't they?" Others said, "How muddleheaded! She misremembered the place and ruined the reputation of the People's Liberation Army." Platoon Deputy He Fujiu hurriedly explained, "It's okay that you found them, it's a small matter. We are already very sorry for troubling everyone all day long. Please don't take this matter to heart..." Before Platoon Deputy He finished speaking, the landlady began to cry with shame. She saw clearly that this was a good army of the people. She shouldn't have hidden the good firewood and left the broken firewood, and hidden the good sweet potatoes and left some sweet potato tails after the People's Liberation Army came. In fact, the People's Liberation Army weighed the firewood and paid for the sweet potatoes, and had not let the people suffer any losses. Today... Under the persuasion of the soldiers and the masses, the landlady stopped crying and said, "In the future, I will always live up to the People's Liberation Army."
　　The landlady was no longer as indifferent to the People's Liberation Army as she had been in the past. Boiling water and borrowing things became very easy. After this incident spread, the people of Wangtun were no longer strangers to the People's Liberation Army.

　　一双洋袜子
    ——新区军民关系小故事
    王屯，离新乡很近，蒋家匪帮不断的到这里抢粮抓丁，老百姓成天吓得东躲西藏，谁也不敢把东西放在明面上。十一月二十三日，解放军驻到这里，好些群众对解放军还不熟悉，所以又吓得东躲西藏的一阵子，后来看到解放军很规矩，躲了的人又都露面，藏了的东西也都扒了出来。一排三班的女房东，也想着把藏在石头底下的一双洋袜子取出来，可是她掀开石头一看，里边却空朗朗的了。这时，战士彭德福正在厨房里烧开水，她想一定是这个战士偷了去，至少他也得知道谁偷的。眼看就要过新年，袜子又没啦，她急得吵呼起来：“谁拿我的袜子了？”战士彭德福解释说：“我们是解放军，不拿群众一针一线，你忘记地方了吧？”
    “没忘！就放在石头底下啦！”
    “你家小孩取走了没有？”
    “没小孩！”
    “我们不会拿你的，还是耐心找找吧！”彭德福耐心的说，女房东却不耐烦听下去了，她说：“我那袜子不会飞，你在这里烧火啦！反正你得知道。”说罢她一折身走开，回到她房里，还嘟囔嘟囔的骂着：“偷东西，土匪………”。
    房东一嚷嚷，院里招满了人，班长于汉礼为难起来，他重复的询问了每个同志，都异口同声的说：“没拿”。于班长熟悉每个同志的个性和作风，他相信同志们的回答。可是房东的袜子却偏偏找不着了，这样不清不白，影响不好。于是决心叫同志们把所有的行装拿出来，请求院里群众作个细致的检查。这行动感动了院里看热闹的人：有的战士的背包还没解开，好几个老大娘上前拦住了。她们嚷着说：“不能解！不能解！咱这队伍不是那队伍（指蒋匪）”。还有一个老大娘拍着心口说：“咱这队伍心平和，不会有那（指拿东西）”。正在这时候，女房东也慌慌张张的从厨房里跑出来，摇幌着手里的袜子说：“别解了，找着啦！藏在风箱里了，怨我记错地方啦！”战士们的心好象一块石头落了地，背包又都打了起来，可是群众却纷纷的议论起来。有的说：“幸亏是解放军，要是四十师（蒋匪），你看打死她了不？”还有的说：“多糊涂！自己记错了地方，败坏解放军的名誉。”排副何福久慌忙解释说：“找着就算了，这是小事情，成天麻烦大家，这就很对不起了，千万别把这个事放在心上……”何排副的话没完，女房东羞愧的呜呜哭起来。她看清了这人民的好队伍，自己不该在解放军来了以后，把好柴藏起来，留下碎柴，把好红薯藏起来，留下些红薯尾巴，其实解放军烧柴过秤，吃红薯给钱，没有让老百姓吃过一点亏，今天…………。女房东在战士和群众的解劝下，收住了眼泪说：“以后我总要对得起解放军”。
    女房东对解放军，再不象过去那样冷淡，烧水借东西都非常的顺当。这事情传出后，王屯的群众对解放军都不再生疏了。
