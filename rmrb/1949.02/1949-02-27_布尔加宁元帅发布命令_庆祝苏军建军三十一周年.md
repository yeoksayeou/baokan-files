Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 24th. February 23rd marked the 31st anniversary of the founding of the Soviet Armed Forces. Marshal Bulganin, Minister of the Armed Forces of the Soviet Union, issued an order to celebrate this great festival. TASS published the original text of the order as follows:

    Comrades Soldiers and Non-Commissioned Officers of the Army and Navy! Comrades Officers and Generals of the Army and Navy! Today, our country commemorates the 31st anniversary of the founding of our armed forces. Since its establishment, the Soviet Armed Forces have traversed a glorious path of combat. In every period of the Soviet state's development, our armed forces have been a reliable protector against the attacks of foreign aggressors. In battles against numerous enemies, the Soviet Armed Forces have withstood severe tests and demonstrated self-sacrificing loyalty to the motherland and to the cause of the Party of Lenin and Stalin. Under the guidance of Stalinist military science, the Soviet Army and Navy have become stronger through skillful application on the battlefield. They won a historic victory in the Great Patriotic War and have become a powerful combat force of the Soviet Union. The armed forces of the Soviet people are truly the people's army, protecting the true interests of the working people. The Soviet people are, of course, proud of their armed forces. Our armed forces have further improved themselves in the post-war years, and have achieved significant success in this regard. However, we must not become complacent because of these successes. All Soviet soldiers must improve their military skills day and night, enhance their military, political, and technical knowledge, and strengthen discipline and organization. Generals and officers of the Army and Navy must not only deeply study our military science, but must also further improve our military science. The experience of the Great Patriotic War and the latest achievements of Soviet military science and technology must be continuously applied to the practical training of the army. We must relentlessly master Lenin's doctrine, educate our subordinates to love military life, and cultivate in them an indestructible loyalty to their military duties. Soldiers and non-commissioned officers of the Army and Navy must strive tirelessly to study military affairs, flawlessly abide by military rules and the orders of superiors, master weapons, improve practical skills, and redouble their efforts to expand the ranks of outstanding individuals who have received excellent military and political training. As we carry out these important tasks, we are encouraged by the outstanding achievements of the Soviet people in the struggle to complete the post-war Five-Year Plan ahead of schedule, and by the firm determination of the Soviet people to strive for new victories on the road to communism. Just as the ruling circles of the United States are frantically seeking to establish world hegemony and pursuing a policy of aggression and launching new wars, the Soviet Union is victoriously implementing plans to develop the national economy and resolutely striving for lasting democratic peace throughout the world. The Soviet Armed Forces must tirelessly maintain a high state of combat readiness. The Soviet people can confidently believe that our Army, Air Force, and Navy will vigilantly guard our socialist motherland.

    Comrades Soldiers and Non-Commissioned Officers of the Army and Navy! Comrades Officers and Generals of the Army and Navy! Now, on the 31st anniversary of the founding of the Soviet Armed Forces, I extend my greetings to you. To commemorate this glorious 31st anniversary, I order: Today, February 23rd, in our country's capital—Moscow, in the capitals of the various Union Republics, in Kaliningrad, Lvov, Khabarovsk, Vladivostok, Port Lushun, and the heroic cities of Leningrad, Stalingrad, Sevastopol, and Odessa, a salvo of twenty guns shall be fired.

    Long live the Soviet Armed Forces!
    Long live the powerful Soviet Motherland!
    Long live our Soviet government!
    Long live the glorious Communist Party!
    Long live our victorious inspirer and organizer, our leader and teacher—the great Stalin!

    　　　　　　　Marshal Bulganin of the Soviet Union, Minister of the Armed Forces of the Soviet Union (signed)

　　布尔加宁元帅发布命令
  　庆祝苏军建军三十一周年
    【新华社陕北廿四日电】二月廿三日，是苏联武装部队建军的三十一周年纪念日。苏联武装部队部部长布尔加宁苏联元帅特发布庆祝这一伟大节日的命令。塔斯社发表该命令的原文如下：
    陆海军战士与士官同志们！陆海军尉校及将军同志们！今天，我们国家纪念我们武装部队建军的卅一周年。苏联武装部队从成立以来，已经历了光荣的战斗的道路。在苏维埃国家发展的各个时期，我们的武装部队是抵御外国侵略者进攻的可靠保护者。在对众多敌人的战斗中，苏联武装部队都经受了严重的考验，并且对祖国、对列宁与斯大林党的事业表现了自我牺牲的忠诚。苏联陆海军在斯大林军事科学的指导下，干练地在战场上运用着，已变得更加坚强；他们在伟大的爱国战争中，赢得了历史性的胜利，而且成为苏联的强大战斗力量。苏联人民的武装部队，是真正人民的部队，它保卫着劳动人民的真正利益。苏维埃人民当然以他们的武装部队自豪。我们的武装部队，在战后年代中使自己更加完善，在这方面，已经有了重大的成功。然而，我们决不可因为有了这些成功而自满。全体苏维埃战士必须日夜提高军事技能，增进军事、政治、技术的知识，加强纪律与组织。陆海军将军及校尉军官们，不仅必须深入研究我们的军事科学，而且还必须进一步提高我们的军事科学。必须不断地将伟大爱国战争的经验、和苏维埃军事科学与技术知识的最新成就，用到军队的实际训练中去。必须不屈不挠地精通列宁的学说，教育部属爱好军事生活，培养他们对军事职责怀抱不可摧毁的忠诚。陆海军战士与士官们，必须努力不倦地研究军事业务，毫无缺点地遵守军事规则与上级的命令，必须掌握武器并改进实际技术，必须加倍扩充受过优良的军事政治训练的出类拔萃的行列。当我们执行这些重要任务的时候，苏联人民在争取提前完成战后五年计划的斗争中所得到的出色的成就，苏联人民在走向共产主义途中争取新胜利的坚定决心，都在鼓舞着我们。正当美国统治集团狂暴地力求建立世界霸权、奉行着进行侵略及发动新战争的政策的时候，苏联却在胜利地实现着发展国民经济的计划，坚决地为全世界持久的民主和平而奋斗。苏联武装部队必须不倦地维持高度的战斗准备状态。苏维埃人民可以放心地相信：我们的陆、空、海军将警惕地警卫着我们的社会主义祖国。
    陆海军战士、士官同志们！陆海军校尉及将军同志们！现在，当苏联武装部队建军三十一周年的时候，我谨向你们致敬。为了纪念这个光荣的三十一周年纪念日，我命令：今天，二月二十三日，在我们祖国的首都——莫斯科、在各加盟共和国的首都、在加里宁格勒、罗夫、伯力、海参崴、旅顺港以及列宁格勒、斯大林格勒、悉瓦斯托波尔、敖德萨等英雄城市，鸣放礼炮廿响。
    苏联武装部队万岁！
    强大的苏维埃祖国万岁！
    我们的苏维埃政府万岁！
    光荣的共产党万岁！
    我们胜利的鼓舞者与组织者、我们的领袖与导师——伟大的斯大林万岁！
