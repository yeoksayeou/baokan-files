Left Right County's Experience in Mobilizing Women
    Pei Xiaoxian Material Song Qi Compilation

    In early November of last year, when Left Right (Liao County) began to conclude land reform work, the initial leadership lacked sufficient understanding of mobilizing women to participate in this movement. Therefore, women were not widely mobilized during the initial rectification of the peasant association. Some places only casually called on a few women, but because the meetings were mostly held at night, women with children and those who had to watch the door at home could not attend, so the actual attendees were only a minority of a minority. Secondly, when electing temporary people's representatives, the leadership did not emphasize the issue of women representatives accounting for one-third of the total number, resulting in only one woman representative among the eleven representatives in Taoyuan Village. In thirty-six other villages, the number of women representatives was also far from sufficient. As for the underestimation of women's strength, it was even more obvious. Most men still retained a strong feudal consciousness in their thinking, believing that, "It's still not clear what use they have?" Women generally showed a sense of inferiority, thinking that they, "Don't understand anything," and, "We are not useful." The reason for this was that women were restricted to the family circle for a long time and lacked confidence in their own abilities.

    This phenomenon of not paying attention to mobilizing women was not corrected until early December. At this time, the leadership realized that not paying attention to women was a reflection of the old society's patriarchal consciousness within the Party. Therefore, they redeployed and emphasized how to organize women and integrate their strength into the current movement. Below are a few experiences we have gained:

    (1) Universally and carefully explain the Party's policy of equal land distribution to women, so that they understand that women should receive the same share of land as men economically and have the right to freely manage, buy, sell, and dispose of their land, and no one should interfere unreasonably. At the same time, it should be emphasized the Party's emphasis on protecting women's land rights. Only in this way can women be encouraged to propose the handling of their own land rights and property rights. As for the important relationship between protecting women's land rights and promoting rural economic prosperity, timely and long-term education should be carried out for all male and female farmers and cadres. Only when most women realize that the current work of concluding land reform is related to their own interests can they care about this work, dare to participate in the struggle, defend their emancipated interests, and fight for their own interests. For example, after such education in Xiguan, when discussing that everyone should get a share of land, some men said, "I don't know when Wang Sanman's daughters will get married, so give them a little less!" At this time, several women argued, "Everyone has a share, daughters are also people, why give them less?" Also, at a mass meeting in Taoyuan Village, a backward element proposed to overturn the case and scolded the village cadres for not tying him up. No one dared to speak out at this time, so Wang Xianghe and other four women stood up and said, "You should seriously examine yourself today. If there were no backward elements in our village, there would be no 'Taoyuan Incident' (attacking District Chief Duan in 1942). What are you and Zheng doing back and forth? You should hate the special agent for pulling you in, not hate the village cadres. The government and village cadres saved you, you should be grateful in your heart!" The women said sentence after sentence, leaving that person speechless. This reminded many people, and everyone said after the meeting, "If the women hadn't brought it up, he would have stopped us." During Party rectification, an old woman in Shijiaoping said, "Party rectification must be done well. Dividing two acres of land is not as good as rectifying the Party well. As long as the Communist Party is there, two acres of land will grow." These facts all show that when women understand that ending land reform and rectifying the Party are closely related to their own interests, they will fight for their own interests, rely closely on the Communist Party, and fight against phenomena that distort the Party's policies.

    (2) Compare the status of women in the new and old societies to enlighten the class consciousness and labor enthusiasm of oppressed women. For example, Sanzhenniang in Xiguan said, "In the past, women were 'wives who were married and horses who were bought', ridden and beaten by others. If they were good, they were for playing with; if they were annoyed, they were for beating." Gao Sannv said, "In the past, they were looking for men to eat, marrying a chicken and following the chicken, marrying a dog and following the dog. Their lives belonged to others, and their deaths belonged to others. Who regarded us as individuals?" Another woman said, "Grinding on the mill every day, doing in front of people, eating behind people. I'm clearly a person, but I'm bought and sold as livestock. Today is completely different. I can find a man to marry myself, and I can go to a meeting and have a say. I have a share of land, all thanks to Chairman Mao's good methods. The Communist Party helped us turn over, and we can't be lazy." From these comparisons, women have all clarified that being able to stand up straight today and not be cattle and horses is inseparable from the leadership of the Communist Party. At the same time, they realize that only by actively working and developing production can they ensure that they will always live like individuals.

    (3) Affirm the strength of women's power from the gains of women's labor and production, and enhance women's confidence. Jinhua in Xiguan Village said, "We can't do without spinning, weaving, sewing, and mending. Our women can also work in the fields. This autumn, more than 300 women in our village harvested more than 1,000 mu of grain. Can you say we are useless?" After she said this, everyone thought of Li Guilan pulling a plow to plant wheat better than a man, and Li Xiaozhi, a military family member, not asking anyone to cultivate the land on her behalf, and organizing 80 women in the village to weed. This broke down the ideas of women looking down on themselves and men looking down on women. Old man Cheng Zhang said, "Women suffer a lot. They make military shoes and grind public grain. You can't fight Chiang Kai-shek without them." Lanhua in Baihou Village said, "We all have to work hard in production. We have labor first, and we have to let our women have a say in everything." Women all understand that their achievements in labor and production are the capital for women to be independent and equal.

    (4) Rely on activists and use advanced women to enlighten the broad masses of women, which is much better than our holding meetings to mobilize and calling on them when something happens. When Taoyuan Village began to end land reform, the women's mood was not high, and they did not speak at meetings. Later, the leadership enlightened the thinking of a dozen activists, and the activist Guo Xiaohua said to everyone, "The number of our women is the same as that of men, and nothing can be done without our women. Men can only control their own affairs, we control our own affairs, and we control family affairs together with men. In the past, people didn't treat us as people, but today we have to treat ourselves as people." After the activists' activities, the women actively participated in the movement to end land reform. However, when mobilizing women to participate in work, do not neglect to organize and educate older women. Only with the cooperation of mothers-in-law and daughters-in-law, family harmony, and active production can development be achieved.

　　左权县发动妇女几点经验
    裴效贤  材料  宋其  整理
    去年十一月初左权（辽县）开始结束土地改革的工作时，起初在领导思想上，对发动妇女参加这一运动认识不足，因此，首先在整顿农会时，就没有普遍地动员妇女群众。有的地方只顺带着叫上了几个妇女，但因会议多是夜间召开，有孩子的妇女和要在家中看门的都不能去，所以实际到会的只是少数中的少数。其次在选举临时人民代表会时，对妇女代表应占全名额三分之一，这一数量问题，领导上也未加以强调，以致桃园村十一个代表中只有一个妇女代表。另有三十六个村妇女代表的名额也是远远不足。至于对妇女力量的轻视就更加明显了。男人们思想上还保留着浓厚的封建意识，大多数人都认为：“现在还弄不清楚她们有啥用？”妇女群众则普遍地表现了自卑感，认为自己：“啥也不懂”，“咱不顶用”。其原因是由于妇女长期地被限制在家庭的圈子以内，对自己的能力缺乏信心。
    这种不重视发动妇女的现象，直到十二月初才有了改正。这时领导上觉悟到不重视妇女群众，是旧社会重男轻女意识在党内的反映。于是才重新布置，并强调了如何组织妇女群众，把她们的力量结合在目前的运动中。下面就是我们已经取得的几点经验：
    （一）在妇女群众中普遍地、细心地讲解党对于平分土地的政策，使她们懂得妇女在经济上应与男子同样分得一份土地，并有自由经营、买卖和处理自己土地的权利，任何人不得无理干涉。同时，并应突出解释党对保障妇女土地权的重视，这样才能启发妇女有勇气提出自己地权、财权的处理，至于对保障妇女土地权与繁荣农村经济间的重要关系，则应抓紧时机对全体男女农民和干部进行及时的和较长期的教育。只有当大部的妇女群众认识到当前结束土地改革工作与自己的利益相关时，她们才能关心这个工作，才敢于参加斗争，保卫翻身利益，争取自身利益。如西关经过这种教育之后，当讨论到每人都应分得一份地时，王三蛮家闺女多，有的男人说：“还不知那天出嫁呢，少给她们分点吧！”这时好几个妇女就争着说：“每人都有一份，闺女也是人，为啥少分？”又如在桃园村一个群众大会上，一个落后分子提出要翻案，并骂村干部不该捆他。这时没有一个人敢出来说话，王祥荷等四个妇女就站起来说：“你今天应该好好检讨检讨自己，咱村如果没有落后分子就不会有“桃园事件”（一九四二年打段区长），你和郑某人来来往往是干啥？你该恨特务拉了你，不该仇恨村干部，政府和村干部挽救了你，你心眼里应该感谢才好？”几个妇女你一句、我一句把那人说得没话了，这一下可提醒了不少人，大家会后都说：“要不是妇女们提，人家可把咱们闹住了。”在整党时，石窖坪有个老婆说：“整党可得闹好哩，分上二亩地不如把党整好，只要共产党在，二亩地就会长在。”这些事实都说明了当妇女群众懂得了结束土地改革整党与自己有密切的关系时，她就会为争取自己的利益而起来斗争，就会紧紧地依靠共产党，和歪曲党的政策的现象作斗争。
    （二）对比新旧社会中妇女地位，启发被压迫阶级妇女的阶级觉悟和劳动热情，如西关三贞娘说：“过去妇女是‘娶到的妻，买到的马’，由人骑由人打，好了是耍的，恼了是打的。”高三女说：“过去是寻汉吃汉，嫁鸡随鸡，嫁狗随狗，活是人家人，死是人家鬼，谁当咱个人看待？”另有一个妇女说：“天天上碾磨，做在人前，吃在人后，明明是个人，可当牲口买卖，今天可全不同了，嫁人自己寻汉，能开上个会有处说讲。地有上一份，这全是毛主席办法好，共产党帮助咱翻了身，咱就不能好吃懒做了。”从这些对比中，妇女们都明确了今天能挺起腰板，不做牛马，是和共产党的领导分不开的。同时认识到，只有积极劳动，生产发家，才能保证永远活得象个人。
    （三）从妇女劳动生产的收获上来肯定妇女力量的强大，增强妇女群众的信心。西关村金花说：“纺花织布、缝缝、补补，离不了咱。咱妇女还能上地劳动，咱村今秋三百多妇女割谷一千多亩，这能说没有用？”经她一说，大家想起了李桂兰拉犁种麦赛过男人，李小之军属不要人代耕，并组织全村八十余妇女锄苗等事情。这样就打通了妇女小看自己和男人轻视妇女的思想。成章老汉说：“妇女可是苦重哩，又作军鞋又碾公粮，打蒋介石可离不了她们。”白后村兰花说：“咱们都得好好生产，咱有劳动在前，有事也得让咱妇女作个主。”妇女们都懂得了自己劳动生产的成绩，就是妇女要自主，要平等的本钱。
    （四）依靠积极分子，通过先进的妇女去启发广大的妇女群众，这样就比我们开会动员、有事即叫强得多。桃园村开始结束土地改革时，妇女情绪不高，开会不发言。后来领导上打通了十几个积极分子的思想，积极分子郭小花就向大家说：“咱妇女人数跟男人一样，啥事没有咱妇女就办不成，男人们只能主他们个人的事，咱们的事咱自己主，家庭的事咱和男人一块主。过去人家不当咱是人，今天咱可要好好当自己是人了。”经过积极分子的活动，妇女们都踊跃地参加了结束土地改革运动。但在发动妇女参加工作时，不要疏忽组织与教育老年妇女，只有婆媳合作，家庭和睦，生产发家才能积极。
