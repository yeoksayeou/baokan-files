　　Yubei Logistics Headquarters
  　Preliminary Experience in Civil Labor Supply Work
    Wang Ji, Zhi Peng
    Since its establishment on December 1st of last year, the Taihang Yubei Logistics Headquarters has mobilized a total of 2,992 militiamen, 907 stretchers, 3,976 laborers, over 3,100 carts, 16,876 livestock, and 11,152 cart workers. It has victoriously completed the task of supporting the front lines. Recently, the Yubei Logistics Headquarters made a preliminary summary of the work in the first stage (December 1st to mid-January), and drew the following points of experience:
    First, regarding the mobilization of civil labor:
    (1) It is necessary to accurately calculate civil labor, use it rationally, and demobilize it in a timely manner. At the beginning of the work, the Yubei Logistics Department paid attention to contacting the troops and unified the calculation and mobilization of civil labor by the Logistics Department. Moreover, it grasped timely demobilization, resulting in very little waste. Failure to do so would cause problems. Once, a certain unit of our army called for carts from Huixian County. At first, because there was no determination with the troops of the number of regular reserves, when the troops came, they temporarily needed carts. The troops did not know how many they needed, and the local area could not prepare in time, resulting in the inability to properly use civil labor. Later, these problems were overcome by unified planning with the civil affairs department of the troops. For example, Xinxiang mobilized more than 30 carts, and Huixian mobilized two militia companies, both of which were able to quickly demobilize because of good communication with the troops.
    (2) In addition to grasping the principles of accuracy and speed in mobilizing civil labor, it is also necessary to determine the concentration time according to the different conditions of dependent levy and allied forces areas (new and old areas) and their distance, in order to be effective. For example, once, when asking for 20 carts from Taishanmiao District of Huojia, only a notice was given to concentrate immediately, but because the area was a new area with poor mass organization, the carts did not arrive until the next day, which caused complaints from the troops and dissatisfaction from the cadres and masses. Later, attention was paid to these issues, and the work went smoothly.
    (3) It is necessary to study with the troops to strictly distinguish the regular civil labor required for following the army and the temporary civil labor needed, and master the allocation, in order to save manpower and financial resources. For example, in the issue of using carts, in the beginning, the regular carts required by the troops were not clearly distinguished from the temporary carts, resulting in the temporary carts being used as regular carts and not being able to be demobilized in time, while the regular carts that went out did not have much work, wasting civil labor and food. Later, the Logistics Department formulated temporary dispatch certificates, and the temporary carts returned immediately after completing their tasks. Regular carts were also given cart certificates, which were replaced once a month, so that the temporary carts and regular carts would not be confused.
    (4) Before the concentration and departure of laborers, militiamen, and carts, or after reaching the destination, an inspection should be carried out, and there must be strong cadres leading the team to discover and solve problems in a timely manner. For example, Huojia once sent 80 carts, but there was no organized inspection before departure. As a result, it was found that 10 carts had not reported to the Logistics Department at all. In addition, some carts were simply unusable, resulting in a waste of civil labor. Another example is Wenxian County, which did not conduct an inspection at the time of departure, causing 26 stretchers and 150 laborers to run for six days, but they were useless, wasting a lot of work.
    (5) The use of participation certificates can encourage and improve the confidence of militiamen, laborers, and cart workers in participating in the war, and overcome the phenomenon of desertion. In the initial work, it was found that individual militiamen, laborers, and cart workers deserted and went home. Because they had no proof, the village thought they had really served, and even gave them alternative duties, making rewards and punishments unclear. Later, the Logistics Department specially printed a kind of participation certificate, stipulating that when all participants returned home after completing their tasks, each village should fill out one, and those without this certificate would not be given alternative duties. And it was notified that both the front and rear areas should implement it. Since then, the participants have attached great importance to this certificate. The militias of Qinyang and Lingchuan call it the "Completion of Task Certificate."
    Second, regarding supply:
    (1) The supply section must be closely integrated with the supply department of the troops in order to solve problems and improve the system in a timely manner. For example, the Logistics Department once held two military and political supply meetings in conjunction with the troops, and formulated plans such as the proportion of noodles eaten by the troops and the conversion of horse feed and firewood. A system was established, which improved the relationship between each other.
    (2) The person in charge of the forward field station should be selected from experienced people, and the scales used before and after must be unified. For example, at the beginning, each grain station did not unify the use of scales, resulting in inaccurate calculation of grain, which affected supply.
    (3) The supply of firewood should be mainly obtained locally. If the troops are stationed in a certain area for too long, they must be supplemented by the support of neighboring areas. When the Fourth Military Sub-district began to deal with the problem of firewood supply, it established a firewood station and transported it from the rear, resulting in considerable waste of manpower. After the establishment of the Logistics Department, the method of obtaining it locally was implemented: the supply area was divided according to the area where the troops were stationed. This saved a lot of civil labor. The masses were also satisfied. However, if the troops stay in a certain area for a long time, it is necessary to supplement it with the support of neighboring areas in order to solve the problem.
    (4) It is necessary to seize the gap in the war to clean up the accounting work in a timely manner. For example, in the battles of Huojia and Jixian, many red and white slips were circulating, which was very chaotic. Therefore, the Logistics Department collected these slips everywhere, and sent people to the various troops to reconcile accounts. In this way, the things given by the masses had a place to be settled, and the expenses of the troops also had a certain reimbursement, giving the masses a good impression.

　　豫北后勤司令部
  　民力供应工作初步经验
    王及　志鹏
    太行豫北后勤司令部自去年十二月一日成立以来，先后共动员了民兵二千九百九十二人、担架九百零七付、民工三千九百七十六人、大车三千一百余辆、牲口一万六千八百七十六头、车工一万一千一百五十二人。胜利地完成了支援前线的任务。最近豫北后勤司令部把第一阶段（十二月一日至一月中旬）的工作作了一个初步总结，得出如下的几点经验：
    第一、关于动员民力方面：
    （一）必须精确的计算民力，合理使用，及时复员。在工作刚开始时，豫北后勤部即注意了与部队联系，统一由后勤部精确的计算民力，调动民力。而且掌握了及时复员，结果浪费很少。不这样做，就会出毛病。有一次我军某部从辉县调用大车，起初因没有与部队确定经常预备的数目，结果部队一来，临时要车，部队不知能要多少，地方上又备办不及，弄得民力不能得到恰当的运用。后来与部队民运部门统一筹划，才克服了这些毛病。又如新乡调用三十余辆大车，辉县动员两个民兵连，也因与部队联系好，都能很快的复员。
    （二）调动民力除掌握准确迅速的原则外，还需依嫡征同力的不同地区（新老区）与其远近等条件，来确定集中时间，方为有效。如一次向获嘉太山庙区要大车二十辆，只仅仅通知了马上集中，但因该地是新区，群众组织较差，大车次日才到，以致部队埋怨，干部群众不满。后来注意到了这些问题，工作才顺利了。
    （三）要与部队研究，将所需随军之常备民力和临时需要的民力严格分清，掌握拨派，以节省人力财力。例如动用大车问题，头一个时候没有将部队需用的常备大车和临时车分清楚，以致把临时车当常备车用了不能及时回员，而常备车出去反而没多少工作，徒浪费民力、食粮。后来后勤部便制定临时差证，临时车完成任务即返。常备车也制定车证，规定一月一换，使临时车与常备车互不紊乱。
    （四）民工、民兵、大车在集中出发以前，或达到目的地后，要进行一次检查，而且必须有坚强干部带领，及时发现问题，解决问题。如获嘉某次派出八十辆大车，出发前没有组织检查，结果发现有十辆大车就根本没有到后勤部接头。另外有的车根本不能用，以致浪费了不少民力。又如温县，在出发时没有检查，使得二十六付担架、一百五十个民工，跑了六天，结果不管用，白白误了好多工。
    （五）使用参战证，能鼓励与提高民兵、民工、车工的参战信心，克服逃亡现象。——在初期工作中发现有个别民兵、民工、车工逃亡回家，由于没证明，村里以为他们真服过勤务了，还给他们顶差，弄得赏罚不明。后来后勤部特印发了一种参战证，规定凡参战人员于任务完成返家时，每村要填发一张，无此证者不给顶差。并通知前后方都执行。从此以后参战人员对此证都很重视，沁阳陵川民兵把它叫做“完成任务证”。
    第二、关于供给方面：
    （一）供应科要和部队供给部门密切结合，才能及时解决问题与改进制度。如后勤兵曾和部队结合，召开了两次军、政供给会议，制定了部队吃面比例，马料柴草折合等计划。建立了制度，因此改进了相互间的关系。
    （二）随军兵站负责人要抽调有经验的人担任，前后用秤必需统一，如各个粮站开始都没有统一用秤，以致计算粮食不精确。影响供给。
    （三）柴草供给应以就地取给为主。如部队在某一地区驻时过长，就必须辅以邻区的支援。四分区开始处理柴草供应问题时，是成立柴草站，从后方运输，结果相当浪费人力。后勤部成立后即实行就地取给办法：根据驻军地区来划分供应区。这样节省了很大的民力。群众也都感到满意。但部队如在某一地区时间住长了，那就必须辅以邻区支援办法，才能解决问题。
    （四）需要抓紧战争空隙及时清理会计工作，如在获嘉、汲县战役中，很多红白条子流通，非常混乱。后勤部于是一方面到处收回这些条子，一方面派人到各部队去对条算帐。这样，群众出了东西才有着落，部队开支也有一定的报销，给群众以良好印象。
