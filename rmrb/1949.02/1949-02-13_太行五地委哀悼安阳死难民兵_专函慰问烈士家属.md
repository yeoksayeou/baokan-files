　　【Reported by this newspaper】The Taihang Fifth Prefectural Committee recently sent a letter of condolence to the families of the militia martyrs of Wangan Village, Anyang. On January 17th, more than 1,000 remnant bandits under the command of the traitor Wu Jingren, entrenched in Anyang, attacked Wangan Village. The village militia ascended the碉(diāo) blockhouse and defended it resolutely. Ultimately, the碉(diāo) blockhouse was burned down, and all bravely sacrificed themselves. The North China Central Bureau sent a special telegram of condolence. On January 25th, the Fifth Prefectural Committee sent a letter of condolence to the families of the martyred militia, calling on the entire county's militia to cooperate with the national victory and prepare to liberate Anyang to avenge the martyrs. The original text stated: "Over 1,000 evil Chiang bandits in Anyang surrounded Wangan Village in our Third District, brutally burning, killing, and looting Wangan, Dongqingliu, and Dongtianzhu villages. Village cadres and militia rose up to defend their homes, bravely resisting the stubborn bandits. Although outnumbered and with ammunition exhausted, our 41 heroic sons of the people did not waver and resisted from the blockhouse. When our reinforcements were about to arrive, the stubborn bandits, with no other recourse, inhumanely set fire to the blockhouse. Our 41 warriors bravely sacrificed themselves, unyielding. We express our deep condolences to the 41 martyrs and our heartfelt sympathy to the families of the martyrs. We also instruct the Anyang County Committee to convene a solemn memorial meeting for the martyrs, to educate the entire county's Party and people about the spirit of the martyrs' heroic struggle and unyielding resistance to the death, to inherit their spirit, to cooperate with the People's Liberation Army, to annihilate the evil remnant Chiang bandits in Anyang, northern Henan, and to capture war criminals to avenge the martyrs. Now, the national liberation war is nearing victory, and the evil Kuomintang reactionary government's army will be eliminated throughout the country. The day of liberation for the people of Anyang is not far off. The day of the total collapse of the Chiang Kai-shek Kuomintang government is not far off, and the war criminals of the whole country will be captured and punished by us. Comrades and cadres of the entire Anyang Party, learn from the spirit of the martyrs, bravely stand at the forefront of the liberation war, lead the people to resolutely strike and eliminate the evil and soon-to-die enemy in Anyang, protect the lives and property of the people, mobilize the masses to fight against the enemy, engage in production to overcome famine, and struggle for the complete elimination of the enemy and the liberation of the people of northern Henan."
