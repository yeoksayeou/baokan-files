Xinhua News Agency, Beiping, 3rd: The solemn entry ceremony of the People's Liberation Army into the ancient capital of Beiping was held at 10:00 AM today. The PLA contingent participating in the ceremony was led by three armored vehicles, floats decorated with portraits of Chairman Mao and Commander-in-Chief Zhu, and a military band. They entered the city through Yongdingmen, followed by mechanized units, a motorized infantry consisting of over a hundred trucks, artillery units towed by automobiles, tank units including light, medium, and heavy tanks, cavalry, and infantry. This magnificent procession passed through Zhengyangmen Street, Dongjiaomin Lane, Chongwenmen Street, Dongsi Archway, Gulou (Drum Tower), Di'anmen Street, Xisi Archway, West Chang'an Street, Hepingmen, and Luomashi Street, finally exiting the city through Guang'anmen. Although the north wind was howling today, the crowds welcoming the PLA were even larger than yesterday and the day before. Groups of workers, students, and citizens ran to the city gates before dawn to wait and watch. More than 8,000 railway employees rushed to the Qianmen Station to line up and welcome them, including many employees who came from Changxindian and Fengtai. Over 2,000 students from Tsinghua University and Yenching University had rushed into the city yesterday from the western suburbs, 20 *li* away from the city. Democratic party figures newly arrived in Beiping from the seat of the North China People's Government, including Zhou Jianren, Hu Yuzhi, Wu Han, Chu Tunan, Han Zhao'e, Shen Zijiu, Liu Qingyang, Zhang Manjun, Yan Xinmin, and Zhou Ying, as well as university professors who had recently visited the North China People's Government and returned to Beiping, such as Zhang Dongsun, Fei Xiaotong, Lei Jieqiong, Yan Jingyao, and Jiao Juyin, along with professors from Tsinghua and Yenching Universities who entered the city, including Zhang Naizhao, Qian Weichang, Shen Yuan, Deng Yizhe, Huang Mei, Zhang Wei, Zhao Fangxiong, Tu Shou'e, Li Guangtian, and Sheng Chenghua, all joined the welcoming ranks. As the PLA passed by, the sounds of gongs and drums, cheers, applause, and songs along the route were incessant. All kinds of costumed *yangge* dance troupes and stilt walkers danced and sang enthusiastically, crowding around the marching column. They and many enthusiastic citizens climbed onto the armored vehicles to chat with the PLA soldiers. Some even wrote various welcoming and grateful phrases on the soldiers' backs with chalk; many elementary school students and female students also joyfully followed alongside the slowly moving vehicles, vying to shake hands with the PLA soldiers. The artillery unit, containing over a hundred cannons of various types, attracted the most attention from the welcoming people along the way. They particularly cheered enthusiastically for the American-made 155mm howitzers, climbing onto the gun barrels to write slogans like "Attack Taiwan!" and sitting on them to move forward with the procession. The originally clean cannons and tanks were almost completely covered with colorful slogans and turned into a riot of colors, covered with the people welcoming them. The people standing on the side of the street forgot their fatigue, watching the rows of troops march by. Many continued to shout slogans with voices already hoarse: "Celebrate the Liberation of Beiping!" "Welcome the People's Liberation Army!" "Long Live Chairman Mao!" "Long Live the Chinese Communist Party!" The citizens of Beiping were completely immersed in this unprecedented carnival in the history of the ancient city.

Xinhua News Agency, Beiping, 2nd: The Beiping Military Control Commission of the Chinese People's Liberation Army and the Beiping People's Government have entered the city to begin work today. Under the leadership of the Military Control Commission, various takeover tasks are being carried out successively. The Kuomintang propaganda organs, the Central News Agency Beiping Branch, the *Huabei Daily*, and the Beiping Broadcasting Station, were taken over on the 31st of last month and the 1st of this month, respectively.

Xinhua News Agency, Beiping, 2nd: The Beiping Federation of All Circles to Celebrate Liberation was established this afternoon in the North Building of Peking University, and is actively carrying out various tasks to welcome the PLA and celebrate the liberation.
