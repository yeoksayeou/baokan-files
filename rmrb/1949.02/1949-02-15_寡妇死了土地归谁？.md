　　Who Inherits a Widow's Land After Her Death?
Editor:
　　There are two problems in our village that cannot be resolved, and I am sending them to you for a reply.
　　(1) An elderly woman named Zhao Dongzhi is sixty-two years old this year. Her husband is dead, and she has no children. She is a well-to-do middle peasant. She has a close nephew who is a middle peasant. If this elderly woman dies in the future, and her land and property are given to her nephew, he will be better off than others. Is it appropriate to give it to the masses?
　　(2) Another elderly woman named Huo Yuwen is fifty-seven years old. She is the family member of a martyr, and she is the only one left in her family. Now she is living with her land and property with her son-in-law. Her son-in-law is from this village and is a well-to-do middle peasant. She also has a close nephew who is an old middle peasant. When this elderly woman dies in the future, should her land and property go to her son-in-law? To her nephew? Or to the masses?
　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　From the Person in Charge of the Longmen Village People's Congress, Xingtai County
　　To the Responsible Comrades of the Longmen Village People's Congress in Xingtai County:
    The answers to the two questions you raised are as follows:
    The two old widows can give their land to whomever they wish. The masses cannot interfere. As long as she leaves a will before she dies, it will be legally binding. Because land can be given away after the land reform. It is not appropriate to distribute her property to the masses.

### 寡妇死了土地归谁？

专栏：询问与答复

　　寡妇死了土地归谁？编辑同志：
    我村有两个问题解决不了，今寄去请答复。
    （一）一个老年妇女叫赵东枝，今年六十二岁了。男人死了，也没孩子，是富裕中农。他近门有个侄儿是个中农。如果以后这老年妇女死了，这份土地财产归了他侄就比别人高，如归群众合适不合适？
    （二）又一个老年妇女叫霍玉文五十七岁了，是个烈属，家里只剩了她一人。现在她带着她的土地财产跟着她女婿吃饭过活。她女婿是本村人，是个富裕中农。另外她还有一个亲侄儿是个老中农。将来这老妇女死了，她的土地财产，归她女婿呢？归她侄儿呢？还是归群众呢？
     　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　邢台县龙门村人代会龙门村人代会负责同志：
    你们所提出的两个问题解答如下：
    那两个老寡妇愿把土地给谁，就可给谁。群众不能干涉。只要她在临死以前，留下遗嘱，在法律上就发生效力。因为土改后土地是可以赠予的。要把她的财产分给群众，是不合适的。 　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　 华北人民政府民政部
