　　Taihang Workers' General Union Instructs All Levels
  　Massively Train Trade Union Cadres
    First Cadre Training Class to Begin Soon
    [Taihang Electric] The Taihang Workers' General Union, in order to strengthen leadership organizations at all levels and more powerfully support the new areas, has specifically instructed subordinate trade unions at all levels to massively train cadres to adapt to future requirements. The instruction stated: Since the People's Liberation Army launched a large-scale counter-offensive, we have transferred a large number of cadres to the new areas, which is our achievement. However, compared with other systems, it is still not enough. The General Union believes that if this issue is not resolved immediately, we will become passive in the rapidly developing situation, and it will be even more impossible to do our work well. To this end, trade unions at all levels must: (1) Boldly promote cadres, first of all, fully equip the vacancies of cadres above the section and county minister level in each district; for those who have already been equipped, try to equip deputies as much as possible, and provide them with assistance in all aspects to improve their working abilities. Only in this way can cadres grow up quickly. (2) It is also necessary to cultivate and educate cadres in large quantities in various organizational forms, such as short-term training courses, trade union spare-time schools, etc. Those who are found to have higher class consciousness, pure thoughts, a desire to make progress, have the potential for training, and have trade union work experience can be promoted to supplement existing vacancies or deputy positions.
    [Taihang Electric] In order to train a large number of outstanding trade union cadres to undertake trade union work in the future New Democratic industrial construction, the Taihang Workers' General Union has established a large-scale training class according to the instructions of the North China Bureau and the District Party Committee. The first phase of the training class will begin in early February, lasting for fifty days, with a total of one hundred and one students. The conditions are: (1) Trade union cadres who are separated from production or semi-separated from production. (2) Factory, mine, and street trade union directors or members who are not separated from production. (3) Male and female workers and unemployed workers who have trade union work experience, have a basic understanding of writing, have specialized skills, are ideologically progressive, have a high degree of class consciousness, and have prestige among the workers. The content of the education is mainly based on the resolutions and other documents of the Sixth National Labor Congress on the current workers' movement as basic teaching materials. It aims to enable each trade union cadre to correctly understand and grasp the Party's policies and guidelines for the labor movement after training.

　　太行职工总会指示各级
  　大量培养工会干部
    第一期干训班即将开始
    【太行电】太行职工总会为了健全各级领导机构，更有力地支援新区，特指示所属各级职工会大量的培养干部，以适应今后要求。指示称：自人民解放军大举反攻以来，我们向新区输送了大量干部，这是我们的成绩。但和其它系统比较起来还是不够的。总会认为这一问题如不立即解决，在迅速发展的形势下，将会陷入被动，更无法搞好工作。为此，各级职工会必须：（一）大胆的提拔干部，首先把各分区及县部长以上的干部缺额的配备齐全；已经配备齐的，要尽可能配备副职，并对他们加以各方面的帮助，以提高其工作能力。只有这样才能迅速使干部生长起来。（二）还要以各种组织形式大量培养教育干部，如短期训练班、职工业余学校等，发现阶级觉悟较高的，思想纯洁的，要求进步的，有培养前途的和有工会工作经验的，即可提拔起来，补充现有缺额或副职。
    【太行电】太行职工总会为培养大量优秀职工干部，担负今后新民主主义的工业建设中的职工工作，特根据华北局及区党委的指示，创办一大规模的训练班。该训练班第一期将于二月初开学，时间为五十天，学员共一百零一名。条件是：（一）脱离生产及半脱离生产的工会干部。（二）不脱离生产的工厂、矿山、街道工会主任或委员。（三）有工会工作经验，粗通文字，带有专门技术的；思想进步，阶级觉悟较高，在工人中有威信的男女工友和失业工人。教育内容，主要是根据全国六次劳大关于当前职工运动的决议等文件为基本教材。旨在使每个职工干部经过训练后，能正确的理解和掌握党的工运政策与方针。
