Tianjin Electric Dispatch: Workers in Tianjin's public enterprises are displaying their creativity.
    The rubber parts factory affiliated with the Tianjin Automobile Repair General Factory has seen its production efficiency surpass pre-Liberation levels in the half-month since resuming operations. Before Liberation, the factory's daily output (based on an eight-hour day) was two pots of automobile outer tires (totaling four tires), sixty sets of bicycle outer tires, fifty bicycle inner tubes, seventeen automobile fan belts, eight storage battery cases, and four hundred brake linings. Now, the daily output is three pots of automobile outer tires (totaling six tires), ninety sets of bicycle outer tires, seventy bicycle inner tubes, thirty automobile fan belts, twelve storage battery cases, and seven hundred brake linings. In terms of product quality, before Liberation, first-class products accounted for about 85 percent, and second-class products accounted for 15 percent. Now, first-class products account for 95 percent, and second-class products account for only 5 percent. The main reason for the factory's increased production efficiency is that the workers have recognized their position as masters in public enterprises and have begun to produce actively with a new labor attitude. Before Liberation, workers were nominally on duty at 8:00 a.m., but in reality, steam was released at 8:00, and it would take at least 8:30 for the vulcanization machine and vulcanization mold to heat up before work could officially begin. Vulcanization time was generally longer, and vulcanization work would stop fifteen minutes or even longer before the end of the shift. At noon, work stopped, the machine cooled down, and in the afternoon it had to be restarted. Now, the workers in each department arrive at the factory shortly after 7:00 a.m. and immediately release steam, and work officially begins at 8:00 a.m. When the automobile outer tire department proposed on February 12 that the machines should not be stopped during the one-hour lunch break, and everyone should take turns eating, the bicycle outer tire, inner tube, and rubber mixing departments responded enthusiastically and unanimously implemented the practice of not stopping work at noon and taking turns eating. Taking or sending belts from the bicycle outer tire steam press used to take at least ten minutes, but now it generally only takes five minutes. Some worker representatives have said, "Now the country belongs to the people, the factory belongs to the people, and we workers are working for ourselves!"
    Tianjin Electric Dispatch: In public enterprises such as Tianjin Paper Mill and public buses after liberation, workers have begun to exert their creativity. Zhang Fengming, a technician from the Hebei Repair Shop of the Tianjin Public Bus Administration, in order to solve the difficulty of parts shortage, through careful research, has been able to manufacture DC generator coil, the cost is cheaper than the market sold, and the quality is not inferior. Tianjin Enterprise Company Machinery Factory, due to the lack of a 16-foot lathe, made it difficult to repair the ammonium compressor shaft sent by the ice factory. The workers automatically found usable parts from the broken machine parts in the stacking yard, and five people put together a new lathe in seven days.
    Li Lianbin and other workers from the First Factory of the Tianjin Paper Industry Company's Ash Dump, in the rush repair of the power transmission lines destroyed by the enemy, took the copper wire from the factory's broken motors to replace the binding wire, solving the difficulty of the lack of binding wire. At the same time, due to the lack of foot buckles and belts, everyone used ropes instead of belts. People climbing the pole top tied themselves to the pole with ropes to work, and then threw the foot buckles down for others to use in turn. The rush repair task was completed quickly.

　　津公营企业工人发扬创造
  　机胶配件厂产量超过解放前水平
    【天津电】津市汽车修配总厂所属之矶胶配件工厂，复工半月来，生产效率已超过解放前。解放以前，该厂日产（以八小时计算）汽车外带两锅（共四支），自行车外带六十副，自行车内带五十副，汽车风扇带十七条，蓄电瓶外壳八个，刹车皮带四百个；现则日产汽车外带三锅（共六支），自行车外带九十副，自行车内带七十副，汽车风扇带三十条，蓄电瓶外壳十二个，刹车皮带七百个。产品质量上，解放前一等品约占百分之八十五；二等品占百分之十五，现在一等品占百分之九十五，二等品只占百分之五。该厂生产效率提高的主要原因，是职工们认识了自己在公营企业中的主人翁地位，开始以新的劳动态度，积极生产。解放以前，职工们名义上是上午八点上班，实际是八点钟放出蒸汽，等到硫化机器和硫化模型热了，至少要八点半钟才能正式开工，硫化时间一般较长，距下班十五分钟甚至更长时间就停止了硫化工作。中午停工，机器冷了，下午还要重新浣。现在，各部职工七点多钟到厂后马上放出蒸汽，八点钟就正式开工。当汽车外带部在二月十二日提出中午休息一小时中要不停机器，大家轮班吃饭，自行车外带、内带、炼胶室等部都热烈响应，一致实行中午不停止工作，轮班吃饭。从制造自行车外带蒸压机里往外取带或往里送带，过去至少要十分钟，现在一般只需五分钟。有些工人代表都这样说：“现在国家是人民的，工厂是人民的，我们工人干活是为我们自己！”
    【天津电】解放后的天津造纸和公共汽车等公营企业中的工人们，开始发挥他们的创造性。津市公共汽车管理处河北修车厂的技工张凤鸣，为了解决零件缺乏的困难，经细心研究，已能自己制造直流发电机的线包，成本较市上所售者低廉，而质量又并无逊色。天津市企业公司机器厂，由于缺少十六英尺车床，使修理制冰厂送来的铵压缩机大轴工作发生困难。工人们就自动从堆积院中的残破机件中寻出可用的部分，五个人在七天之内凑成一台新车床。
    天津纸业公司灰堆第一厂工人李连斌等，在抢修被敌破坏的输电线路中，把厂内坏了的马达内的铜线取下代替绑线，解决了绑线缺乏的困难，同时由于脚扣和皮带的缺乏，大家又用绳子代替皮带，爬上电杆顶的人，用绳子把自己捆在杆上工作，再把脚扣扔下给别人轮流使用。迅速的完成了抢修任务。
