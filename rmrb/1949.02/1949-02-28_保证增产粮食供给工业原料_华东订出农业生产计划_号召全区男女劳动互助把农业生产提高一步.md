　　Guarantee Increased Grain Production and Supply of Industrial Raw Materials
  　East China Formulates Agricultural Production Plan
    Calls on All Men and Women in the Region to Help Each Other in Labor to Raise Agricultural Production to a New Level
    [Xinhua News Agency, East China, 23rd] The East China Central Bureau of the Communist Party of China has formulated the 1949 East China Agricultural Production Plan, which stipulates that the focus should be on increasing grain production while ensuring the supply of industrial raw materials. This plan was formulated based on the general policy of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China to raise agricultural production in the liberated areas to a new level and the actual conditions in the East China region. The plan requires that grain production in the old and semi-old areas of Shandong Province this year should increase by 10% compared to the average harvest in 1948. The province should increase grain production by 1.4 billion jin. The basic policy for achieving increased agricultural production this year in the old and semi-old areas is intensive cultivation and fertilization. The slogan is: "Apply one more cart of manure per mu, hoe the land one more time, and harvest 10% more grain." In the new areas and some old areas where famine is still severe, it is necessary to resolutely implement the slogan of "no land left uncultivated, no one left to starve to death" and actively organize the masses to produce and provide disaster relief. Regarding the production of industrial raw materials, based on current needs and production conditions, the plan determines that the main focus is on greatly increasing the production of cotton and peanuts. The province should plant 4 million mu of cotton, harvesting 120 million jin. The province should plant 5.6 million mu of peanuts, harvesting 84 million jin. The province should plant 1.4 million mu of hemp, harvesting 11.2 million jin. In addition, yellow tobacco should be planted appropriately in the Weixian and Changle areas. In Central China, because there are vast newly liberated areas that have suffered severely from the Kuomintang bandit army and have experienced floods, the serious task of "no land left uncultivated, no one left to starve to death" should still be resolutely implemented. Specific plans should be formulated by the Central China Working Committee of the Communist Party of China based on local conditions.
    In order to achieve the above objectives, the plan proposes that, in addition to the government providing financial and material assistance to poor farmers to develop production as much as possible, it is necessary to guide farmers to ensure timely cultivation, widespread selection of seeds, prevention and control of diseases and pests, elimination of wasteland, and expansion of cultivated land area. To develop animal husbandry, state-owned ranches should be established with a focus; veterinarians should be trained and veterinary stations should be established; and the raising of breeding livestock and the establishment of breeding livestock stations should be promoted. Repairing rivers and managing water conservancy are important measures to ensure increased production. In addition to paying attention to mobilizing the masses to dredge rivers, build dikes, and dig wells for irrigation, it is recommended that the government be responsible for the planned repair of major projects on major rivers, such as repairing the Yellow River, the Grand Canal, the Yi River, the Shu River, and the Wei River, to ensure that no floods occur. In addition, farmers should be led to plant trees and afforest mountains to prevent floods and wind disasters. The plan calls for mobilizing and organizing more than 50 million rural people in the East China Liberated Area to increase their production enthusiasm and the initiative to develop their families through labor, organize mutual labor assistance, and widely absorb women and all full and semi-labor forces to participate in agricultural production, so as to raise agricultural production to a new level, in order to effectively support the War of Liberation, ensure army supplies, and improve people's lives.

　　保证增产粮食供给工业原料
  　华东订出农业生产计划
    号召全区男女劳动互助把农业生产提高一步
    【新华社华东二十三日电】中共华东中央局制订了一九四九年华东农业生产计划，规定以增加粮食为主，并保证工业原料的供给。这个计划是根据中共中央把解放区农业生产提高一步之总方针和华东地区的实际情况制定的。该计划要求：在山东的老区半老区内，今年粮食生产要比一九四八年一般收成增加百分之十。全省要增加粮食十四万万市斤。老区半老区实现今年农业增产的基本方针是精耕细作，加工施肥。口号是：“每亩多上一车粪，多锄一遍地，多打一成粮。”在新区及部分老区灾荒仍很严重，必须贯彻“不荒一亩地，不饿死一个人”的口号，积极组织广大群众生产救灾。关于工业原料的生产，根据目前的需要和生产情况，该计划确定主要地是大量增产棉花和花生，棉花，全省要种四百万亩，收获一万二千万斤。花生，全省要种五百六十万亩，收获八万四千万斤。麻，全省要种一百四十万亩，收获一千一百二十万斤。此外，在潍县、昌乐一带酌量增种黄烟。在华中，因为有广大的新解放区，过去曾遭受国民党匪军的严重摧残。并曾发生水灾，因此，仍应坚决贯彻“生产不荒一亩地，救灾不饿死一个人”的严重任务，具体计划由中国共产党华中工作委员会根据当地具体情况自行订定。
    为达到上述目的，该计划提出：除由政府尽可能地以财力、物力扶助贫苦农民发展生产以外，必须领导农民做到耕种及时，普遍选择籽种，防除病害、虫害，消灭荒地，扩大耕地面积。为发展畜牧业，应有重点地设立公营牧场；培养与训练兽医，设立兽医站；提倡喂种畜、设立种畜站。修治河道与办水利是保证增产的重要措施之一，各地除应注意发动群众性的浚河筑堤凿井灌溉等事业外，建议由政府负责有计划地修治主要河流的较大工程，如修治黄河、运河、沂河、沭河、潍河等河，保证不发生水灾。此外，并领导农民植树造林和封山，以防止水灾和风灾。该计划号召动员与组织华东解放区五千余万农村人民，提高其生产热情与劳动发家的积极性，组织劳动互助，广泛地吸收妇女及一切全劳动力和半劳动力参加农业生产，把农业生产提高一步，以达到有力地支援解放战争，保证军队供给与改善人民生活的目的。
