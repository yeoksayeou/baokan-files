【Jizhong Electric】The workers of the Baoding Iron Factory, in order to support the front lines, gloriously completed the urgent task assigned by the People's Liberation Army during the Spring Festival in four days. This task consisted of three thousand eight hundred drill rods (each weighing three and a half jin) and two hundred fire hooks and fire shovels. At the time, there were only six sand-molding workers, and they were in the process of opening the furnace to make machine parts. The amount of pig iron in the factory was four times less than the amount needed. Moreover, because people were busy celebrating the New Year, it was quite difficult to complete the task on schedule. However, after the factory's responsible personnel explained the situation, technician Xu Mingxian first took out nearly 10,000 jin of pig iron he had purchased. The factory also found four sand-molding workers to help, and transferred workers from the fitter, furnace, and machinist groups to join the effort. Consequently, on the night of the twenty-sixth day of the twelfth lunar month, they started the furnace and worked around the clock, only resting for three hours each day. The next morning at 8 o'clock, they only rested for an hour and a half before returning to work. Sand-molding worker Lu Wenrui, who had taken leave due to a sore on his shoulder, voluntarily returned to work. Yu Haicheng worked hard for two nights without sleep, continuing to persist. When he felt drowsy, he would wash his eyes with boiling water and rush back to work. On New Year's Eve, when other factories and shops were closed for the holiday, they worked tirelessly to resolutely complete their task. Two fitter and carpenter workers also came to help with sand-molding. Fitter Li Fude said, "Our brothers on the front lines are shedding blood and sweat, what does it matter if we sleep a few nights less?" Under their active efforts, work efficiency doubled, and the task was completed on schedule.

　　保定铁工厂工人春节不休息
  　四天完成紧急支前任务
    【冀中电】保定铁工厂为支援前线，于春节中四天内光荣地完成了解放军所交付的三千八百根钻棍（每根重三斤半）及火钩火铲等二百把的紧急任务。当时翻沙工人仅六个，正值开炉制机器零件，厂内所存的生铁距所需数目相差四倍，又因人们正忙于过年，按期完成颇有困难。但经厂内负责人员讲明后，技师许明贤首先拿出了收买的近万斤生铁，厂方并找了四个翻沙工人帮忙，把钳工、烧炉、机工等各股工人抽调出来，投入这一工作，随于阴历十二月二十六日的当夜里，开炉赶制，昼夜不停的工作，每天只休息三个钟头，到次晨八点，只休息了一个半小时，后又工作起来。翻沙工人路文瑞，肩膀上长了疮，已休假了，又自动起来工作。于海成两夜没有睡觉，仍努力坚持着，盹了用开水洗洗眼睛，就又赶起来。除夕夜里，别的工厂商店都放了假，他们为坚决突击任务，都不停息的工作。钳工、木工、两个工人也来帮助翻沙。钳工李福德说：“战士兄弟们在前方流血流汗，咱们少睡几宿觉又算什么？”在他们积极突击下，提高了工作效率的一倍，按期完成了任务。
