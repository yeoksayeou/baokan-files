Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 22nd. "The Soviet state has already demonstrated to the world how to solve the women's issue, how to eliminate the despicable, shameless, and ugly situations of the old society, that is, the situation of complete lack of women's rights or insufficient women's rights, as Lenin said." This was pointed out in a recent editorial in Pravda. The title of the editorial is: "Soviet Women – Active Builders of Communism." The editorial wrote: Thanks to the complete equality of political and economic rights granted to women and men by the Lenin-Stalin Party and the Soviet regime, Soviet women have obtained all the possibilities to develop their diverse talents and creativity. On an equal footing with men, they are working hard to participate in the work of revitalizing and developing the national economy, and striving to participate in the great cause of building a communist society. In the Soviet state, they have become fully mature members of society, playing an active role in all aspects of social, political, economic, and cultural life, and becoming active builders of communism.

Pravda pointed out: Almost half of the industrial workers in the Soviet Union are women. Tens of thousands of women hold leading positions in various industrial and commercial enterprises. Among experts and industrial managers, there are more than 250,000 women. Millions of collective farm women are fighting for the further upsurge of agriculture, for increasing yields and developing livestock breeding, and actively participating in the Stalin plan to transform nature. At the same time, more than two million women are engaged in education. The role of women in state administration provides a vivid example of their social and political activity. About 500,000 Soviet women have been elected as representatives of local Soviets, 1,738 have been elected as representatives of the Supreme Soviets of various Union Republics and Autonomous Republics, and 277 have been elected as representatives of the Supreme Soviet of the Soviet Union.

Pravda finally emphasized: The vital interests of Soviet society require that outstanding women be promoted more boldly and resolutely to important positions in the economic departments, the Party, the trade unions, and the Communist Youth League.

　　苏联妇女积极参加国家建设
  　全苏产业工人妇女几占半数
    【新华社陕北二十二日电】“苏维埃国家已经向全世界说明了怎样才能解决妇女问题，怎样才能消除旧社会的卑鄙、无耻和丑恶的情况，即列宁所说的那种完全没有女权或没有充分女权的情况。”这是真理报最近在一篇社论里指出的。社论的题目是：“苏维埃妇女——共产主义的积极建设者”。社论写道：由于列宁、斯大林党和苏维埃政权给予妇女和男子完全平等的政治、经济权利，苏联妇女得到了发展她们多方面的天才和创造力的一切可能性。她们在与男子平等的基础上，努力参加复兴和发展国民经济的工作，努力参加建设共产主义社会的伟大事业。她们在苏维埃国家里，已经成为完全成熟的社会成员，在社会、政治、经济、文化生活各方面都起着积极作用，成为共产主义的积极建设者。
    真理报指出：苏联的产业工人当中几乎有一半是妇女。有成千成万的妇女，在各种工商企业中担任着领导工作。在专家与工业经理人员当中，妇女有二十五万多人。有几百万集体农妇正在为着农业的进一步高涨，为着增加收获量和发展牲畜繁殖而奋斗，并积极地参加实行改造自然的斯大林计划。同时，有二百多万妇女在做教育作。妇女在国家行政中的作用，提供了她们底社会、政治活动能力的生动的例子。苏联妇女约有五十万人被选为地方苏联埃代表，一千七百三十八人被选为各加盟共和国与自治共和国最高苏维埃代表，二百七十七人被选为苏联最高苏维埃代表。
    真理报最后强调指出：苏维埃社会的切身利益，要求更加大胆更加紧决地提拔优秀的妇女，让她们担任经济部门的、党的、职工会的与共产主义青年团的重要的职务。
