　　Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 23rd. The Italian reactionary authorities ordered the police on the 17th to launch an attack on workers occupying a paper mill in Isola del Liri, southeast of Rome, wounding dozens of workers with gunfire and arresting 14 workers. This bloody massacre has aroused the anger of the Italian working people. According to TASS Rome: On the 18th, printing industry workers in the province of Rome held a four-hour protest strike to show solidarity with the victims of police terror. Isola del Liri and the entire province of Frosinone (in the Latin Quarter) are continuing a general protest strike. Vittorio, Secretary-General of the Italian General Confederation of Labor, led a delegation from the General Confederation of Labor on the evening of the 18th to meet with Prime Minister Gasperi and Interior Minister Scelba, protesting the provocative actions of the police in Isola del Liri. The General Confederation of Labor issued a communique on the evening of February 18th stating that the General Confederation of Labor has protested to the government regarding the systematic attacks by large numbers of police on working people participating in trade union struggles. The protest emphasized that the police are protecting the interests of the factory owners, which has intensified the dissatisfaction of the masses. The masses are defending their economic rights on a legitimate basis. The communique stated that Gasperi expressed the hope that the national atmosphere would ease. But this is only possible when the police armed forces are not used to protect the privileges of the factory owners. Unità commented on the Isola del Liri incident, thanking the working people of the province of Rome and the Latin Quarter for the solidarity they showed with the Liri workers. Unità wrote that the working people of Rome proved that "the only way to ease the atmosphere" is the inviolable unity of the people, which can make the government stop and force it to abandon its plans to incite conflict and engage in atrocities.

    总工会抗议政府袒护厂主利益
    【新华社陕北二十三日电】意大利反动当局下令警察于十七日在罗马东南的伊索拉·德尔·利里镇向占领造纸厂的工人发动袭击，枪伤工人数十人，并逮捕工人十四人。这一血腥屠杀事件，激起了意大利劳动人民的愤怒。据塔斯社罗马讯：罗马省印刷工业工人于十八日举行四小时抗议罢工，声援警察恐怖下的牺牲者。伊索拉·德尔·利里和弗罗辛农全省（在拉丁区）仍在继续进行抗议总罢工。意大利总工会总书记维特瑞奥于十八日晚率领总工会代表团往见总理加斯贝利和内长谢尔巴，对警察在伊索拉·德尔·利里的挑衅行动提出抗议。总工会于二月十八日晚发表公报称：总工会已就大批警察有系统地攻击参加工会斗争的劳动人民，向政府提出抗议。抗议中着重指出：警察保护着厂主的利益，这加强了群众的不满。群众是在合法的基础上维护他们的经济权利的。公报称：加斯贝利表示希望全国的空气将能缓和。但这只有在警察武装不用以保护厂主的特权时，才有可能。团结报评论伊索拉·德尔·利里的事件时，感谢罗马省及拉丁区劳动人民对利里工人所表示的团结。团结报写道，罗马劳动人民证明了：“缓和空气”的唯一道路，就是人民的不可侮的团结，这种团结能够使政府住手，并迫使它放弃煽动冲突和从事暴行的计划。
