　　Significant Achievements in Studying in She County
    Nearly All Pass the Test
    In She County, due to the County Committee and County Head's emphasis on on-the-job cadres' learning, the learning enthusiasm of personnel in various agencies is very high. For example, Yao Jintang, a doctor from the County Federation of Cooperatives, is already sixty-six years old but has become an active participant in this study; he speaks enthusiastically during discussions, takes notes, and if he doesn't understand something, he writes it down to ask others. Comrade Gao Xishun from the County Committee reads books or newspapers in his spare time, and his comrades all say, "Xishun has a book in his hand every day." The teachers at the Normal School are very serious, and arguments often occur. The cadres in charge of cultural and educational supplies used to be very lax in their studies, but this time they are particularly active. On the evening of the Lantern Festival, when there were operas in the streets, everyone still studied the newspaper and did not go to watch. On the thirteenth of this month, a current affairs test was held. The number of people tested was forty-seven in Group B and forty-nine in Group C. The test results: In Group B, six people scored above 90, twenty-one people scored between 80 and 90, fourteen people scored between 70 and 80, ten people scored between 60 and 70, and only one person failed. The results of Group C were not much different from those of Group B. From this, it can be seen that the county's study has achieved results.

　　涉县学习大有成绩
    测验将近完全及格
    涉县由于县委、县长重视在职干部学习，各机关人员的学习情绪都很高涨。如县联社医生姚继唐，已六十六岁，成了这次学习中的积极分子；讨论时发言踊跃，写笔记，有不懂的便记下来去问别人。县委会高喜顺同志在工作之暇不看书就看报，同志们都说：“喜顺每天手不释卷”。师范学校的教员非常认真，时常发生争执。文教用品的干部，过去的学习很松懈，这次也显得特别积极，元霄节晚上，街上唱戏，大家仍然学习报纸，没有去看。本月十三日举行时事测验。测验人数，乙组四十七人，丙组四十九人。测验结果：乙组九十分以上的共六人，八十到九十分的二十一人，七十分到八十分的十四人，六十分到七十分的十人，不及格者仅一人。丙组的成绩和乙组相差不远。由此看来，该县的学习是有成绩的。
