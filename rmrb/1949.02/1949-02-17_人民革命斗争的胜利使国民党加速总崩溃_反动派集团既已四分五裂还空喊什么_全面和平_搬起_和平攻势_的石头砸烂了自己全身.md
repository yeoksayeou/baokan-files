Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, February 15th: The speed of the Kuomintang reactionaries' collapse is faster than people expected. It has only been a little over four months since the People's Liberation Army captured Jinan, and only a little over three months since the capture of Shenyang. However, all the remaining forces of the Kuomintang in military, political, economic, and cultural propaganda have already fallen into an irreparable state of division and disintegration. The total collapse of the Kuomintang began during the Huaihai Campaign in the south and the Pingjin Campaign in the north. These two campaigns caused the Kuomintang to lose approximately 1.05 million troops, including 105 full divisions of the Kuomintang's regular army, in less than three months from the beginning of November last year to the end of January this year. The total collapse of the Kuomintang is fundamentally the inevitable result of the great victory of the Chinese People's War of Liberation and the Chinese People's Revolutionary Movement. However, the "peace" trick of the Kuomintang and its American masters played a considerable role in shortening the process of the Kuomintang's collapse. The stone called "peace offensive," which the Kuomintang reactionaries started lifting on January 1 this year, was originally intended to strike the Chinese people, but now it has hit their own feet; or, to put it more correctly, it has smashed the Kuomintang itself from head to toe. Except for the peaceful resolution of the Beiping issue with the assistance of General Fu Zuoyi, the big and small bosses of Chiang Kai-shek, Li Zongren, Sun Ke, Bai Chongxi, Zhang Qun, Zhang Zhizhong, and the provinces and cities nominally still under Kuomintang rule are now entrenched in their own areas, hanging their own signs, and playing their own game. The Americans stand aside anxiously, deeply hating their sons for not living up to expectations. In fact, the magic weapon of peace offensive was produced in American factories, and the Americans gave it to the Kuomintang more than half a year ago. Stuart himself revealed this secret. He told the Central News Agency reporter after Chiang Kai-shek issued the so-called New Year's Day message that this was "what I have been personally striving to obtain." According to the Associated Press, the reporter lost his job for publishing this "unpublished" remark. The Chiang Kai-shek clique had long been reluctant to accept this order from the Americans. The reason was clearly stated in an instruction issued by the Kuomintang Central Propaganda Department on December 27 last year: "If we cannot fight, then we cannot make peace. If we can fight, then talking about peace will only disintegrate morale and popular support. Therefore, whether we can fight or not, talking about peace has nothing but harm." The Kuomintang issued this instruction because other factions of the Kuomintang were already advocating peace talks. On December 25 last year, Bai Chongxi and the Hubei Provincial Assembly under his guidance raised the issue of a peaceful settlement with Chiang Kai-shek, forcing Chiang Kai-shek to issue a statement on January 1 this year to conduct peace talks under five conditions. Chiang Kai-shek hoped to seize the right to invent the peace offensive from Bai Chongxi and continue the old rule under a new trademark. On January 8, Chiang Kai-shek sent Zhang Qun to Hankou and Changsha to ask for the support of Bai Chongxi and Cheng Qian, and on the same day, he asked the governments of the United States, Britain, France, and the Soviet Union to intervene in the Chinese civil war. However, all these steps failed. Chairman Mao Zedong's statement on January 14 fatally shattered Chiang Kai-shek's false peace conspiracy, forcing Chiang Kai-shek to "retire" behind the scenes a week later. Although Chiang Kai-shek, Li Zongren, and the Americans had made various arrangements for this move, hoping to stage a more watchable farce, the result was contrary to their expectations. Not only were there fewer and fewer audience members, but even the actors on stage disappeared one after another. Chiang Kai-shek continues to command his remaining forces from Fenghua in his "unofficial position," but he has lost his legitimacy, and fewer and fewer people believe in him. Sun Ke's "Executive Yuan" automatically announced the "relocation of the government to Guangzhou." This illegitimate child "government" separated itself from its "President" and "Acting President" on the one hand, and also separated itself from its "Legislative Yuan" and "Control Yuan" on the other. The total number of bogus legislators is 750, with more than 200 in Shanghai, more than 120 in Taiwan, and only 57 reporting in Guangzhou as of the 11th. According to the organizational law of the bogus Legislative Yuan, it requires more than one-third of the members to be present to hold a meeting. The Kuomintang's Central Standing Committee, although declared to be in session in Guangzhou, has only eleven members of the Central Standing Committee of the party in Guangzhou, less than one-quarter of its total of more than 50 people. Sun Ke's "Executive Yuan" calls for war, but the "Ministry of National Defense" that conducts the war claims to be neither in Guangzhou nor in Nanjing. People only know that its spokesperson is in Shanghai. In this way, Li Zongren will only be left with "the sky is low over Wu and Chu" and "nothing in sight" in the city of Nanjing. Almost none of the orders that Li Wanren has issued since he took office on the 21st of last month have been implemented. Although the Kuomintang no longer has a "comprehensive" "government," and although local peace activities are being carried out everywhere in Nanjing, Shanghai, Guangzhou, Wuhan, Changsha, the Northwest, and the Southwest, the Kuomintang diehards are opposing local peace and demanding so-called comprehensive peace. Its actual meaning is to cancel peace. The farce of a divided and disintegrated Kuomintang organization demanding so-called comprehensive peace reached a comical climax in a statement by Deng Wenyi, director of the Political Warfare Bureau of the bogus Ministry of National Defense in Shanghai, on the 9th of this month. Like Sun Ke, Deng Wenyi overturned Li Zongren's statement on the 22nd of last month that the CCP's eight peace conditions should be the basis for negotiations, and demanded so-called "equal peace, comprehensive peace," otherwise "we will not hesitate to sacrifice everything and deal with the Communist Party to the end." However, Deng Wenyi did not say who his counterpart should negotiate "equal" and "comprehensive" peace with today. It seems that finding Wenyi cannot solve the problem, but it seems that not finding Deng Wenyi or other Zhang Sanlisi cannot solve the problem either, which will be too embarrassing. According to a Central News Agency dispatch from Shanghai on the 9th: "A reporter asked Deng Wenyi: Has Acting President Li agreed to the four opinions expressed by Director Deng? Answer: I am speaking from the position of the Ministry of National Defense. The four opinions expressed today have not been submitted to Acting President Li for review in advance." Deng Wenyi here not only created a local position for the bogus Ministry of National Defense to distinguish it from the comprehensive position of the Kuomintang government, but also actually created a small local position for the Political Warfare Bureau of the bogus Ministry of National Defense to distinguish it from the large local position of the bogus Ministry of National Defense. Because Deng Wenyi openly opposed and fabricated rumors to slander the local peace in Beiping, while the bogus Ministry of National Defense praised the local peace in Beiping on January 27, saying that it was "in order to shorten the war and achieve peace, so as to preserve the foundation of the ancient capital of Beiping and cultural relics and monuments," and that other places such as Datong and Suiyuan would also "implement a truce" in the same way. It can be seen that the reactionaries who shout the loudest for comprehensive peace are actually the reactionaries who lack the most comprehensive position. A Political Warfare Bureau of the Ministry of National Defense can contradict the Ministry of National Defense and can also contradict his Acting President. These reactionaries are the biggest obstacle to the realization of peace in China today. They dream of promoting all-out war under the slogan of comprehensive peace, that is, so-called "war must be all-out war, and peace must be comprehensive peace," but in fact, they have neither the strength to implement comprehensive peace nor the strength to implement comprehensive war. The comprehensive strength lies with the Chinese people, the Chinese People's Liberation Army, the Chinese Communist Party, and other democratic parties. Not on the side of the divided and disintegrated Kuomintang. On the one hand, there is comprehensive strength, and on the other hand, it is trapped in a tragic situation of division and disintegration. This situation is the result of the Chinese people's long-term struggle and the Kuomintang's long-term wrongdoing. No serious person can ignore this basic fact in the current Chinese political situation.

　　人民革命斗争的胜利使国民党加速总崩溃
    反动派集团既已四分五裂还空喊什么“全面和平” 
    搬起“和平攻势”的石头砸烂了自己全身
    【新华社陕北十五日电】国民党反动派崩溃的速度，比人们预料的要快。现在距离解放军攻克济南只有四个多月，距离攻克沈阳只有三个多月，但是国民党在军事上、政治上、经济上、文化宣传上的一切残余力量，却已经陷于不可挽救的四分五裂、土崩瓦解的状态。国民党的总崩溃开始于南线的淮海战役和北线的平津战役期间，这两个战役使国民党在去年十一月初至今年一月底的不足三个月中丧失约一百零五万人，包括国民党正规军一百零五个整师。国民党的总崩溃根本上是中国人民解放战争和中国人民革命运动伟大胜利的必然结果，但是国民党及其美国主人的“和平”诡计，对于缩短国民党崩溃的过程，起了相当的作用。国民党反动派从今年一月一日开始搬起的一块名叫“和平攻势”的石头，原想要用来打击中国人民的，现在是打在他们自己的脚上了；或者说得正确些，是把国民党自己从头到脚都打烂了。除了在傅作义将军的协助下和平地解决了北平问题外，其余蒋介石、李宗仁、孙科、白崇禧、张群、张治中以及名义上还属于国民党统治下的各省各城的大小头目，现在各据一方，挂着各人的招牌，打着各人的主意。美国人站在一旁发干急，深恨其儿子们不争气。其实，和平攻势这个法宝出产于美国工厂，还在大半年以前就由美国人送给了国民党。司徒雷登本人曾经泄露这个秘密，他在蒋介石发出所谓元旦文告以后，曾告中央社记者说这是“我过去所一直亲自努力以求得东西”，据合众社称该记者因发表了这段“不得发表”的话而丢了饭碗。蒋介石集团长期地不敢接受美国人的这个命令，其理由在国民党中宣部去年十二月廿七日的一项指示中说得很明白：“我如不能战，则亦不能和。我如能战，则言和又徒使士气人心解体。故无论我能战与否，言和皆有百害而无一利。”国民党当时发出这个指示，是因为国民党的其他派别已经在主张言和了。去年十二月廿五日，白崇禧及其指导下的湖北省参议会向蒋介石提出了和平解决的问题，迫使蒋介石不得不在今年一月一日发布在五个条件下进行和谈的声明。蒋介石希望从白崇禧手里夺回和平攻势的发明权，并在新的商标下继续旧的统治。蒋介石于一月八日派张群到汉口和长沙去要求白崇禧和程潜的支持，同日向美英法苏四国政府要求干涉中国内战。但是这些步骤全都失败了。中国共产党毛泽东主席在一月十四日的声明，致命地击破了蒋介石的假和平阴谋，使蒋介石在一个星期以后不得不“引退”到幕后去。虽然蒋介石、李宗仁和美国人对于这一手曾经作过各种布置，希望合演一出比较可看的双簧，但是结果与他们的预期相反，不但台下的观众愈走愈稀，连台上的演员也陆续失了踪迹。蒋介石在奉化仍然以“在野地位”继续指挥他的残余力量，但是他已丧失了合法地位，相信他的人已愈来愈少。孙科的“行政院”自动宣布“迁政府于广州”，这个私生子“政府”一面脱离了它的“总统”“代总统”，另一面也脱离了它的“立法院”“监察院”。伪立法委员总额七百五十人，现在上海者二百余人，在台湾者一百廿余人，在广州者至十一日止报到者仅五十七人，而按伪立法院的组织法，须有三分之一以上出席才能开会。国民党的中央常务委员会，虽已在广州宣告开会，但在广州的该党中常委员只有十一人，尚不足其总额五十余人的四分之一。孙科的“行政院”号召战争，但是进行战争的“国防部”却称不在广州，也不在南京，人们只知道它的发言人是在上海。这样，李宗仁在石头城上将只剩下了“天低吴楚”，“眼空无物”。李完仁自上月廿一日登台到现在下过的命令，几乎没有一项是实行了的。虽然国民党已经没有一个“全面”的“政府”，虽然无论在南京，在上海，在广州，在武汉，在长沙，在西北，在西南，到处都在进行着局部和平的活动，但是国民党死硬派却在反对局部和平而要求所谓全面和平，其实际意义就是取消和平。以四分五裂土崩瓦解的国民党组织而要求所谓全面和平的滑稽剧，在本月九日上海伪国防部政工局长战争罪犯邓文仪的一篇声明中，达到了滑稽的高峰。邓文仪和孙科一样，推翻了李宗仁于上月廿二日关于以中共的八项和平条件为谈判基础的声明，而要求所谓“平等的和平，全面的和平”，否则“不惜牺牲一切，与共党周旋到底”。但是邓文仪没有说出在今天他的对方究竟应和什么人去谈判“平等的”“全面的”和平。似乎找到文仪是不能解决问题的，但是似乎不找邓文仪或者其他张三李四也不能解决问题，这将未免叫人太为难了。据中央社上海九日电称：“新闻记者问邓文仪：李代总统是否已同意邓局长所发表之四项意见？答：本人系在国防部立场发言，本日所发表之四项意见，事前并未呈经李代总统过目。”邓文仪在这里不但创造了一个伪国防部的局部立场以区别于国民党政府的全面立场，而且事实上还创造了一个伪国防部政工局的小局部立场以区别于伪国防部的大局部立场，因为邓文仪公开反对并造谣污蔑北平的局部和平，而伪国防部在一月二十七日称赞北平局部和平，是“为了缩短战争获致和平，借以保全北平故都基础与文物古迹”，并称其他地方例如大同绥远等处亦将依同样方法“实施休战”。由此可见，叫喊全面和平最起劲的反动派，原来就是最缺乏全面立场的反动派。一个国防部政工局可以和国防部互相矛盾，又可以和他的代总统互相矛盾。这些反动派是今天中国实现和平的最大障碍。他们梦想在全面和平的口号下鼓吹全面战争，即所谓“战要全面战，和要全面和”，但是事实上他们既没有什么力量实行全面和平，也没有什么力量实行全面战争。全面的力量是在中国人民、中国人民解放军，中国共产党和其他民主党派这一方面。不在四分五裂土崩瓦解的国民党方面。一方面，握有全面的力量，另一方面，陷于四分五裂土崩瓦解的惨境，这种局面，是中国人民长期奋斗和国民党长期作孽的结果，任何郑重的人，都不能忽视今天中国政治形势中这个基本的事实。
