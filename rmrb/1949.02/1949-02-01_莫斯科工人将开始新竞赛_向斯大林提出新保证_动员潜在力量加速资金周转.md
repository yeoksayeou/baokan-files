　　Xinhua News Agency, North Shaanxi, 29th: TASS, Moscow, 26th – All major newspapers here prominently published on their front pages a letter from all personnel of 300 industrial enterprises in the Moscow Oblast and the city of Moscow to J.V. Stalin, Chairman of the Council of Ministers of the USSR. The letter first recalls the broad movement launched last year by Moscow industrial workers to operate enterprises profitably, reduce production costs, and accumulate funds above plan. The people of Moscow fulfilled their pledges ahead of schedule, exceeding the 1948 capital accumulation plan and dedicating an additional 2 billion rubles to the socialist motherland. However, they believe that this is only the first result of efforts to improve the quality of work. The letter states: We believe that there are still many untapped potential forces in our industry, and mobilizing these forces will help to further increase the country's economic strength and improve the welfare of the Soviet people. To accomplish these tasks, accelerating the turnover rate of working capital in enterprises is of great importance, as this will make it possible to increase output without additional capital investment and will help to further consolidate the Soviet ruble. The letter continues: After assessing our potential forces, we pledge to organize work in enterprises, increase the production volume of each ruble of working capital, and withdraw 400 million rubles from working capital to meet the needs of the national economy in 1949. The letter describes the specific obligations that all personnel of enterprises in the Moscow Oblast and the city of Moscow will undertake in the movement to accelerate the turnover rate of working capital and save a portion of working capital.
　　The *Pravda* editorial emphasized the significance of this new initiative by Moscow workers, saying: Undoubtedly, this letter from the workers to Stalin marks the beginning of a new competition among millions of Soviet people to further develop the national economy, develop socialist industry, and consolidate the socialist economy. Every ruble of working capital that Soviet enterprises receive from the state must produce a certain amount of products during the year. All personnel of major enterprises in Moscow have made it their important economic task to increase the production volume of each ruble of working capital, accelerate the turnover rate of working capital, and thereby withdraw a portion of working capital to hand over to the state. This new patriotic initiative of theirs proves how infinite are the potential forces possessed by the socialist planned economic system.

　　莫斯科工人将开始新竞赛
  　向斯大林提出新保证
    动员潜在力量加速资金周转
    【新华社陕北二十九日电】塔斯社莫斯科二十六日讯：此间各大报纸均以首页显著地位，刊登莫斯科州和莫斯科市三百家工业企业的全体人员致苏联部长会议主席斯大林的信，该信首先追述去年莫斯科工业工人曾发动有利地经营企业，减低生产成本及超计划资金积累的广泛运动。莫斯科人民提前完成了他们的保证，超过一九四八年资金积累计划，额外以二十亿卢布献给了社会主义祖国。但是，他们认为这只是努力改进工作质量的第一个结果。该信说：我们认为，我们的工业中还有许多尚未利用的潜在力量，如果把这些力量动员起来，即将有助于国家经济力量的进一步增长与苏维埃人民福利的提高。为了要完成这些任务，加速各企业流动资金的周转率，就具有巨大的重要性，因为这将使产量可能增加而毋需额外投入资金，且将有助于苏维埃卢布的进一步巩固。该信继称：在估量了我们的潜在力量以后，我们保证组织企业中的工作，增加每一卢布的流动资金的生产量，并从流动资金中抽出四亿卢布，以供一九四九年国民经济的需要。该信叙述了莫斯科州和莫斯科市企业的全体人员在加速流动资金周转率和节省一部分流动资金的运动中所将承担的具体义务。
    真理报在社论中强调指出莫斯科工人们这一新创议的意义说：无疑的，工人们写给斯大林的这封信，标志着千百万苏维埃人民争取进一步发展国民经济、发展社会主义工业和巩固社会主义经济的新竞赛的开始。苏维埃企业从国家所得到的流动资金的每一个卢布，必须在一年中间生产出一定数量的产品。莫斯科各主要企业的全体人员，把增加流动资金的每一个卢布的生产量，加速流动资金的周转率，并由此抽出一部分流动资金交给国家，作为他们自己的重要的经济任务；他们这一爱国主义的新创举，证明社会主义计划性的经济制度所拥有的潜在力量，是多么无穷无尽。
