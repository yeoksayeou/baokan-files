Jizhong Electricity - Jizhong Administrative Office, based on the needs of the current situation and the basic principles of cultural education of the North China People's Government, and proceeding from the specific conditions of Jizhong, has formulated a draft of implementation measures for restoring and rectifying national education. After overcoming the "leftist" deviations in education that once existed in some places, as well as the tendency to neglect education, the education work in the entire region has made considerable progress. There are now 11,423 teachers in higher and lower primary schools. There are 7,190 junior primary schools, with 443,964 students; 613 senior primary schools, with 57,181 students. The total number of students in higher and lower primary schools is 501,145 (girls account for 31.3 percent). This accounts for more than 68 percent of the school-age children in the region. However, there are still some problems that need to be solved urgently.

The Administrative Office Education Conference re-clarified the education policy based on the situation. To prevent children lacking family labor from dropping out of school, lunch classes, night classes, or "study as you come" arrangements should be established. These classes should be given the same importance as regular primary schools. If manpower is insufficient, additional teachers can be hired or semi-volunteer teachers from the village can be employed to help. The annual class time should not be less than 36 weeks. Required courses should be completed before the holidays, and social activities should be reduced. Primary schools must emphasize cultural education. Junior primary schools should pay attention to literacy and emphasize classroom learning. A timetable must be established, and a system of leave of absence and make-up classes can be established for students. During the busy farming season, the study time can be changed, but the necessary courses should be completed, and the holidays should not exceed twelve weeks. Establish a strict system of tests, promotions, graduation, and enrollment. The conference also decided that the time until June 1949 would be the time for the restoration and rectification of national education. Implementation plans were made separately based on different situations and regions. In areas with a better educational foundation, schools should become more standardized and improve their quality; in areas with a weaker foundation, in addition to restoring the original primary schools, primary schools should be appropriately added so that general villages can achieve one school per village; new districts, cities, and disaster areas should formulate appropriate measures according to the specific situation of primary schools. In order to complete the above plan, governments at all levels should strengthen their leadership over education, education cadres should be fully equipped, and education departments should establish their own business systems. The livelihood and work problems of teachers must also be addressed and resolved in a timely manner.

　　冀中整顿国民教育
  　行署教育会议制定各项实施办法
    【冀中电】冀中行署根据目前形势发展的需要，及华北人民政府关于文化教育的基本方针，从冀中具体情况出发，订出了恢复整顿国民教育实施办法草案。全区经过克服某些地方曾一度存在的教育中的左的偏向，以及忽视教育的倾向后，教育工作获得不少成绩。现在有高初小教师一万一千四百二十三名。初小七千一百九十所，学生四十四万三千九百六十四名；高小六百一十三处，学生五万七千一百八十一名。总计高初小学生五十万一千一百四十五人（女生占百分之三十一点三）。占全区学龄儿童百分之六十八以上。但目前仍存在一些问题急待解决。
    行署教育会议根据情况重新阐明教育方针。为使家庭劳动缺乏的儿童不致失学，应设午学班、夜班或随到随学。此种班次应与正规小学同等重视，如人力不够还可增聘教员或聘请村中半义务教员帮助。全年上课时间不得少于卅六周，放假前完成必修课，减少社会活动。小学必须重视文化教育，初小应注意识字，重视课堂学习。必须制订课程表，对学生可建立请假补课制度。农忙季节可改变学习时间，但应完成必要课程的学习，且假期不得超过十二周。建立严格的测验、升级、毕业、招生制度等。会议并决定至一九四九年六月以前为国民教育之恢复与整顿时间。并根据几种不同情况、地区，分别作出实施计划。教育基础较好地区，学校要走向正规并提高质量；基础较差地区，除恢复原有小学外，要适当增设小学，使一般村庄达到一村一校；新区、城市及灾区小学校按具体情况作出适当办法。为完成上述计划，各级政府应加强对教育之领导，教育干部要配备齐全，教育科应建立本部门业务制度。教员生活及工作问题，亦须注意及时解决。
