Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, February 2nd: The Central Committee of the Communist Party of China sent a congratulatory message on the great victory of the liberation of Beiping and Tianjin. The telegram stated: Comrades Lin Biao, Luo Ronghuan, Nie Rongzhen, Bo Yibo, and all comrades of the Northeast People's Liberation Army and the North China People's Liberation Army:

　　Congratulations on your great victory in liberating Beiping and Tianjin, thereby fundamentally liberating the entire North China. In the two months of operations in North China, you eliminated one Kuomintang regular army corps headquarters, one garrison command, four army headquarters, and twenty-four complete divisions, along with other Kuomintang troops totaling approximately 260,000 men. You compelled General Fu Zuoyi, Commander-in-Chief of the Kuomintang army's North China "剿共" (bandit suppression) headquarters in Beiping, and his subordinate "剿匪" (bandit suppression) headquarters, two corps headquarters, eight army headquarters, and twenty-five divisions, along with other Kuomintang troops totaling more than 200,000 men, to accept peace terms and leave the city to be reorganized into the People's Liberation Army. All these great victories are the result of the heroic and skillful fighting of our People's Liberation Army, the concerted efforts of the military and civilians in the front and rear, and the unanimous support of the people across the country, various democratic parties, and people's organizations. The great victory of the People's Liberation War in North China, together with the great victories of the People's Liberation Wars in Northeast, East China, Central Plains, and Northwest China, as well as the victory of the People's Guerrilla War in the South, have laid a solid foundation for the nationwide victory of the people's liberation struggle. The Kuomintang reactionary government is already in a state of disintegration and collapse in terms of military, political, and economic affairs. Unless it thoroughly accepts the eight peace conditions put forward by the Communist Party of China and supported by the people of the whole country, and realizes genuine democratic peace in accordance with the will of the people and the example of Beiping, it will be completely annihilated. Now, on the historic occasion of the liberation of the great ancient city of Beiping, we extend our respects to all our heroic three million-plus People's Liberation Army soldiers. Eternal glory to all the martyrs who sacrificed themselves in the liberation war.
　　Central Committee of the Communist Party of China

    【新华社陕北二日电】中国共产党中央委员会电贺解放平津的伟大胜利。电称：林彪、罗荣桓、聂荣臻、薄一波诸同志及东北人民解放军、华北人民解放军全体同志们：
    庆祝你们解放北平、天津、从而在基本上解放了全华北的伟大胜利。你们在华北两个月的作战中，消灭了国民党正规军一个兵团部，一个警备司令部，四个军部，二十四个整师，连同其他国民党部队共约二十六万余人，迫使北平国民党军华北“剿共”总司令傅作义将军及其所部一个“剿匪”总部、两个兵团部、八个军部、二十五个师，连同其他国民党部队共二十余万人接受和平条件，出城改编为人民解放军。凡此伟大胜利，都是我人民解放军英勇善战，前后方军民协力奋斗和全国人民全国各民主党派人民团体一致赞助的结果。华北人民解放战争的伟大胜利，连同东北、华东、中原、西北人民解放战争的伟大胜利，以及南方人民游击战争的胜利在一起，已经奠定了人民解放斗争在全国胜利的巩固基础。国民党反动政府无论在军事上、政治上和经济上都已经陷于四分五裂动摇崩溃的绝境，除了彻底接受中国共产党所提出、而为全国人民所拥护的八项和平条件，按照人民的意志和北平的范例实现真正的民主的和平以外，它就将彻底地被歼灭。现当伟大的北平古都被解放的历史节日，特向我全体英勇的三百余万人民解放军致敬意。一切在解放战争中牺牲的烈士们永垂不朽。
　　中国共产党中央委员会
