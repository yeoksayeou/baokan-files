Xinhua News Agency, Shenyang, February 9th. The Shenyang City All-Circles Celebration of the Victory of the Liberation of Tianjin and Peiping sent a telegram of respect to Chairman Mao of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China, Commander-in-Chief Zhu of the Chinese People's Liberation Army, and all commanders and fighters. The telegram to Chairman Mao briefly stated: Today, a million people in Shenyang are celebrating the great victory of the liberation of Tianjin and Peiping. This is the happiest festival we have ever had in history. We have changed from slaves to masters of the country. We sincerely thank you, because this is the result of your great and wise leadership. Now, from Heilongjiang to the Yangtze River, the people have either turned over or are in the process of turning over to become masters. Compatriots south of the Yangtze River are yearning for liberation. The central task before us is to develop production with unparalleled efficiency, support the Northeast People's Liberation Army and the National Liberation Army, eliminate the remaining enemy forces who dare to continue to resist, carry the revolution through to the end, and liberate all of China. As for the recent "peace" conspiracies of the reactionaries, we see through their tricks. We, the million people of Shenyang, resolutely support the eight peace terms you proposed on January 14th. At the same time, we warmly welcome the January 22nd statement on the current situation issued by Li Jishen, Shen Junru, and 55 other people from various democratic parties, people's organizations, and democratic figures who recently arrived in the People's Liberation Area. Only under the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party and you, and with the united action of the people's democratic forces to resolutely oppose the false peace conspiracies orchestrated by American imperialism and the Kuomintang reactionaries, can true democratic peace be realized. The telegram to Commander-in-Chief Zhu and all commanders and fighters of the People's Liberation Army briefly stated: In our revelry, we have not forgotten that today is due to the wise leadership of Chairman Mao and Commander-in-Chief Zhu of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China, and the hard work of the brave and good-fighting soldiers of the Chinese People's Liberation Army. Please tell the soldiers of the Northeast People's Liberation Army fighting in the Guan: We hope you will fight bravely against the enemy in the Guan without any worries. We, the people of Northeast China, will support the front with a hundred times the effort to restore and develop production in the rear, give preferential treatment to the families of revolutionary martyrs and revolutionary soldiers, and strive for the final victory of the national revolution.
