　　Sent to My Husband at the Front
　　Qiao Junying, Dacheng Village, Eighth District, Zaoqiang

　　Winter Solstice has passed, then Minor Cold, after Major Cold comes the New Year. We had a good harvest this year, and the whole family has food and clothing. Our family has truly turned over, and we all love the New Year. You are winning battles at the front; I wish you extra meals for the New Year.

　　You joined the army two years ago so bravely, without needing cadres to mobilize you. You rode a tall horse, with red flowers and green leaves pinned to your chest. I was so proud when I saw you, and everyone praised me: "You have such a good husband, the village feels honored too." It's been almost three years since you joined the People's Liberation Army. The feudal forces have all been overthrown, and we have divided property and land. We help each other during the autumn and wheat harvests, and we don't make things difficult for military families. Our family didn't have livestock, so the village takes care of plowing for us. You don't need to worry about things at home; I wish you peace of mind at the front.

　　Since entering the twelfth lunar month, every household has been preparing for the New Year. Our father went to the market, and bought everything needed for the New Year. He bought red candles and New Year pictures, and wrote new couplets on several sheets of red paper. The top line of the couplet says we have turned over, and the bottom line says we must produce. Pork, mutton, scallions, ginger, and garlic, and my mother-in-law and I are grinding white flour. Our father is very happy, and our mother's face is full of joy. We will eat meat and vegetables on New Year's Eve, and dumplings at the fifth watch on the first day of the New Year. I want to save a bowl for you, so you can taste the food of liberation.

　　Our child, Little Tiger, has already gone to school to study. Every time there is a monthly exam at school, Tiger's name is at the top. Our mother is spinning and selling thread at home, and we use the money to buy soy sauce and salt. Our father is very strong, and he gathers firewood and collects fertilizer. I take care of food and clothing at home, and I serve the two elders without neglect. This autumn, when we hand over public grain, we will be model grain payers again. The villagers all praise us, saying we are not like we used to be. The whole country is about to be liberated, and the reactionaries will be finished in a few days. You must make one last effort, and then we will be reunited after victory.

　　寄给前方的丈夫
    枣强八区大成村  乔俊英
    冬至过去交小寒，过了大寒到新年，今年年景收得好，一家大小有吃穿；咱家真是翻了身，逢到新年都喜欢；你在前方打胜仗，祝你新年多加餐。
    前年参军多勇敢，不用干部不动员；高头大马你骑着，红花绿叶挂胸前；我一瞧见真光彩，人人都把我称赞：“你有这样好丈夫，村里也觉有光沾。”自你参加解放军，不知不觉整三年，封建势力都打倒，分了东西又分田；过秋过麦都帮忙，不叫军属来作难；咱家本来没牲口，村里代耕来照管；家里不用你挂念，祝你安心在前线。
    自从踩进腊月门，家家户户把年办，咱爹也去把集赶，新年的东西买齐全；红烛年画全买到，几张红纸写新联，上联写的咱翻身，下联写上要生产；猪肉羊肉葱姜蒜，我和婆婆磨白面；咱爹心里很高兴，咱娘脸上光喜欢；三十吃的是肉菜，初一五更吃饺子，我想给你留一碗，叫你尝尝翻身饭。
    咱的孩子小虎儿，已去学校把书念，每逢学校月季考，虎的名字写在前。咱娘在家纺卖线，有钱去买酱油盐。咱爹身体很壮健，拾柴积肥他都干；家里吃穿我来做，供奉二老不怠慢；今年秋后征公粮，缴粮模范又是咱，村里群众齐赞扬，都说咱不象从前。全国眼看要解放，反动派几天就完蛋，你要最后努把力，胜利以后再团圆。
