　　Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 19th: TASS, Tokyo, 16th: The Central Committee of the Japan Labour-Farmer Party rejected the proposal from the Japanese Communist Party for the merger of the two parties, but the party agreed to jointly establish a united front with the Socialist Party and the Communist Party.
　　Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 19th: Tokyo dispatch: Yoshida Shigeru, the ringleader of Japan's reactionary Liberal Party, resigned from the House of Representatives on the 11th as a formality, and then, on the 16th, formed a new reactionary cabinet as a formality because the Liberal Party was the largest party in the House of Representatives. Yoshida Shigeru recruited another reactionary party, the Democratic Party, into the cabinet, taking the positions of Minister of Commerce and Industry and Minister without Portfolio, making the new cabinet a so-called "coalition" cabinet of the Liberal Party and the Democratic Party. However, Yoshida Shigeru did not obtain the support of all Democratic Party members. Among the 114 members of the Democratic Party in both houses, 66 members signed a motion of no confidence in the party leader, Inukai Ken's, motion to participate in the Yoshida cabinet. In order to avoid a split within the Democratic Party, Inukai Ken did not even dare to personally join the cabinet. Apart from the addition of two Democratic Party cabinet members as decoration, the rest of the new cabinet was the same old crew from the Yoshida cabinet. The list of important cabinet members of the new cabinet is as follows: Prime Minister and Foreign Minister Yoshida Shigeru, Finance Minister Hayato Ikeda (former Vice-Minister of Finance in the Yoshida cabinet), Labor Minister Masafumi Suzuki, Minister of Commerce and Industry Heitaro Hishigaki (former president of Yokohama Rubber Company), Chief Cabinet Secretary Kinshichi Masuda (former Labor Minister in the Yoshida cabinet), etc.

  　赞成建立联合阵线
  　吉田组成反动新阁
    【新华社陕北十九日电】塔斯社东京十六日讯：日本工农党中央委员会曾拒绝日本共产党关于两党合并的建议，但该党同意与社会党及共产党共同建立联合战线。
    【新华社陕北十九日电】东京讯：日本反动的民主自由党党魁吉田茂，于十一日向众院循例辞职后，又于十六日因民主自由党为众院第一大党而循例组成新的反动内阁。吉田茂以商工相与无任所相两个席位并收罗了另一反动政党——民主党入阁，使新阁成为民主自由党与民主党的所谓“联合”内阁。然而，吉田茂并没有取得全部民主党议员的支持。民主党在参众两院的一百一十四名议员中，曾有六十六名议员签名不信任该党党魁犬养健所提的参加吉田内阁的动议。为了避免民主党内部的分裂，犬养健甚至不敢亲自入阁。新阁除点缀了两名民主党阁员外，其他均为吉田内阁的原班人马。新阁重要阁员名单如下：首相兼外相吉田茂、藏相池田勇人（曾任吉田内阁大藏省次官）、劳工相铃木正文、商工相菱垣平太郎（曾任横滨树胶公司总裁）、内阁书记长官增田杵七（曾任吉田内阁劳工相）等。
