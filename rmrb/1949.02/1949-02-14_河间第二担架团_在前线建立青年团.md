　　Second Hejian Stretcher Team
　　Establishes Youth League at the Front

　　[Reported by this newspaper] The Second Hejian Labor Support Team established a Youth League during its logistics support work on the Tianjin front. In the past twenty-five days, two groups of outstanding young people, totaling seventy-two members, have honorably joined the League and established five League branches. The League has not only achieved success in propaganda and discipline observance in the new district, but also plays a core role in carrying out tasks, consolidating the troops, and establishing a long-term support-the-front ideology. For example, after the Youth League members in the First and Fourth Districts responded to the call by Team Leader Wang and Political Commissar Xiao of the stretcher team to "establish a long-term support-the-front concept of following the troops wherever they fight" and strive for a "steel stretcher team," the League members took the lead in their work and initiated pledges and challenges throughout the team. During task execution, the entire stretcher team ensured gentle lifting and placement and considerate care for the wounded, who were cold and hungry. Youth League member Shi Ziyun not only proactively took off his cotton coat to cover the wounded but also used his rice bowl to collect urine and warmed the wounded's hands during breaks, never leaving his side. Under his influence, eighteen stretcher bearers learned from him. The establishment of the League was as follows: first, the County Youth Committee, together with cadres from the League, company cadres, and village branch committees, formed a seven-member League Committee. The League Committee then selected outstanding Party members to form a working group for League development. Based on the support-the-front tasks, the following criteria for joining the League were determined: 1. Voluntarily came to support the front this time with good class background; 2. Loves and cares for the sick and wounded and is willing to sacrifice everything for them; 3. Actively works and takes the lead in all aspects; 4. Obeys orders and follows commands, guaranteeing not to return home until the task is completed. Then, taking the company as a unit, the nature, tasks, membership requirements, procedures, and organizational structure of the Youth League were explained. The procedure of automatic registration followed by approval from the League Committee was adopted. After each company held meetings, twenty-one outstanding young people joined the League in the first batch. After the first batch joined the League, they were organized into groups of three and a branch was established with five people. The meetings stipulated that group meetings would be held every three days, and branch meetings every five days. Furthermore, these League members once again raised the calls: 1. Joining the League at the front is the most glorious; 2. Young people should join the League, the League is their second family; 3. Cherish the youth's own organization. Extensive and in-depth publicity and preparation were carried out, and then a second batch of fifty-one people joined the League.

　　河间第二担架团
  　在前线建立青年团
    【本报讯】河间民工第二团，在支援天津前线的后勤工作中，建立了青年团，二十五天来，已有两批优秀青年共七十二人光荣入团，建立了五个团支部。该团不但在新区宣传，遵守纪律上获得成绩，而且在执行任务，巩固部队，树立长期支前思想上起着核心作用。如一、四两区的青年团员们，在响应担架团王团长、萧政委提出的：“树立部队打到那跟到那的长期支前观念”和争取“钢铁担架团”的号召后，团员们在工作中便起了带头作用，掀起了全团宣誓、挑战，提出了保证。在执行任务中全担架团都作到了轻抬轻放，开心照顾伤员冷饿。青年团员史自云不但主动脱下棉袄给伤员盖好，还拿饭碗接尿，休息时给伤员暖手，总不离开，在他影响下有十八名担架员向他学习。建团的经过是：首先由县青委同团、连干部、村支委共七人组成团委会，由团委会选择优秀党员，组成发展团的工作组，并根据支前任务确定了入团条件：一、此次支前是自动来的，成份好的；二、爱护伤病员能牺牲自己的一切；三、工作积极各方面起带头作用的；四、服从命令听指挥，保证不完成任务不回家的。然后以连为单位，讲解青年团的性质、任务、入团条件、手续和组织机构。采取自动报名，经团委会批准入团的手续。各连召开会议后，第一批就有二十一个优秀青年入了团。第一批入团后，即三人编成一组，五人设一支部。会议规定小组会三天一次，支部会五天一次。更由这些团员再次提出了：一、前方入团最光荣；二、青年人应当入团，团是自己的第二家庭；三、要爱护青年人自己的组织的号召。进行扩大深入的宣传酝酿，接着便又吸收了第二批五十一人入了团。
