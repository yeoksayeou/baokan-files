[Jidong Electric] Tangshan City's postal and telecommunications services have rapidly recovered and developed in the short period since liberation. The post office began postal services with all liberated areas across the country on the day after the city's liberation (December 13th). City telephones were quickly repaired by telephone workers and restored to service. Long-distance telephone lines were connected to Guye, Linxi, Lutai, and other places within a few days. The telephone line between Luan County and Shanhaiguan, a distance of more than 100 kilometers, was severely damaged by bandit troops. After the Telecommunications Bureau dispatched workers to actively repair it, wired telegrams and long-distance telephone calls between Tangshan and Shanhaiguan resumed operation in early January. After Tianjin was liberated on the 15th of last month, the post office began postal services with Tianjin. The Telecommunications Bureau immediately dispatched a repair team to rush repair work on the Tianjin-Tangshan line. The repairs were completed on the 21st, and telephone service commenced. So far, telegrams and telephone services have been unobstructed between Tianjin and Shanhaiguan, a distance of more than 250 kilometers. The Telecommunications Bureau is now actively working to establish communication links between North China and Northeast China. There were originally 1,067 telephone subscribers in Tangshan City. When the Chiang bandits fled the city, they carried out wanton sabotage and dismantling. Only 861 households could continue to make calls. After the democratic government took over, it actively added equipment. In addition to installing 86 telephone sets for government agency subscribers, it also added 100 new telephone numbers specifically for use by merchants and civilians. As of now, there are 1,074 telephone numbers in the city.

　　唐山邮电迅速恢复
    【冀东电】唐山市的邮电事业，在解放后的短时期内，迅速恢复发展。该市解放次日（十二月十三日）邮局即开始与全国各解放区通邮。市内电话也为电话工人迅速修复通话。长途电话在数日内即通达古冶、林西、芦台等地。滦县至山海关间一百余公里的电话线路，曾遭匪军严重破坏，经电信局派出工人积极抢修，至一月上旬，唐山至山海关间的有线电报及长途电话才开始通报通话。上月十五日天津解放后，邮局即开始与天津通邮，电信局立即派出抢修队，赶修津唐间的线路，至二十一日抢修完竣开始通话。至此，天津至山海关间二百五十余公里间的电报电话，已畅通无阻。现电信局正积极沟通华北与东北间的通信关系中。唐山市内的电话用户原有一零六七家，蒋匪逃离该市时，曾横加破坏拆卸，能继续通话者只有八六一户。经民主政府接管后，积极添设器材，除添装了机关用户的电话机八十六台外，并新添电话一百号，专供商民使用。截止目前，全市电话达一零七四号。
