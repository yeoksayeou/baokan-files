Hygiene Common Sense

　　Household Hygiene and Public Health
　　Many of our rural areas usually do not pay much attention to hygiene, resulting in frequent illnesses in many families, causing losses in both lives and property. Now that spring is approaching and diseases are about to break out again, everyone should pay attention to hygiene to prevent epidemics. Do not listen to the words of those witches and sorcerers; "gods" cannot guarantee that you will not get sick, but hygiene can indeed prevent diseases.
　　Regarding household hygiene, we should pay attention to the following things:
　　First, sweep the courtyard regularly. Dig a pit next to the yard and pour dirty soil, dirty water, and ashes into it. Cover it with a layer of soil every few days. This can accumulate fertilizer and prevent the odor from spreading. Second, the outhouse should be far away from where people live and cook. In some places, families do not dig outhouses and defecate anywhere, which is very unhygienic. Third, pigpens and livestock pens should be built and cleaned regularly. In hot weather, they should be cleaned every ten days. The troughs for feeding livestock and pigs should be kept clean at all times. Letting livestock and pigs roam freely in the yard and on the street will make everything very dirty and will also make it difficult to accumulate fertilizer.
　　Regarding public health, we should also pay special attention to the following: First, streets should be swept regularly, which can be managed in sections or swept in rotation. Village cadres should be responsible for organizing regular general cleanups in a village. Second, within one hundred feet around the water source (wells, springs, etc.) where the whole village gets water, there must be no outhouses, to avoid contaminating the water. Third, trees can be planted on the streets and in the yards. More trees can regulate rainfall, freshen the air, and provide wood. Planting fruit trees can also provide fruit. Fourth, manure piles should be moved outside the village or to the edge of the field. Put it in a pit, or seal it with mud if it is piled on the ground, so that it can fully ferment and make the fertilizer better. Piling manure on the street or in the yard will cause it to be blown away by the wind or washed away by rain, which is also a great hindrance to hygiene.
　　The following is a hygiene agreement made by Hejia Village, which can be used as a reference for various villages:
　　(1) The well platform should be built higher and covered.
　　(2) Each household should clean the streets in sections, move toilets that hinder hygiene, and each toilet should be dug deep, with a small opening, and covered to prevent flies.
　　(3) Transform pigpens, dig pen pits, and make pigsties face the sun. Pigs will grow faster, will not run around on the street, and will accumulate good manure.
　　(4) Furniture and water tanks should be washed and cleaned frequently.
　　(5) Eliminate lice and bedbugs, wash clothes often, and sun quilts and mats.

### 家庭卫生和公共卫生

专栏：卫生常识

　　家庭卫生和公共卫生
    我们许多农村平时对于卫生不太讲究，以致弄得许多人家常常闹病，人财都受损失，现在快到春天，病又快发作了，大家都应该讲卫生，防止瘟疫流行。千万不要听那些巫师神婆的话，“神”不能保证不生病，卫生确是能防止疾病的。
    关于家庭卫生方面，我们应该注意下面几件事情：
    第一、经常地打扫庭院，在院子旁边挖一个坑，把脏土脏水灶灰等倒在里面。隔几天盖上一层土，这样可积肥，又可免得臭味发散。第二、茅房应该离住人和做饭的地方远一些，有的地方家里不挖茅房，随便大小便，这些很不卫生的。第三、应该搭猪圈、圈牲口，并经常打扫。热天要每十天清除一回，喂牲口喂猪的槽，要经常保持干净。随便把牲口和猪放在院里和街上，会到处弄得很脏，而且也不容易积攒肥料。
    关于公共卫生，我们也应该特别注意：第一、街道要常打扫，可以分段来管，或者轮流扫除。一个村子村干部应负责组织举行定期的大扫除。第二、全村吃水的地方（水井、水泉等）周围一百尺，一定不能有茅房，省得把水弄脏。第三、街上和院里都可以栽些树木，树多了可调剂雨量，使空气新鲜，还可供给木料之用。栽果木树还可以吃到水果。第四、应该把粪堆弄到村外或场边。把他堆在坑里，堆在地面上的也可以用泥封起来，这样可以使其能充分发酵，使肥料变得更好。把粪堆在街上或院里，他是会被风吹走或雨水冲走的，对于卫生也有很大妨碍。
    下面是和家庄订的一个卫生公约，可以供各村参考：
    （一）井台要垒高，要加盖。
    （二）各户分段打扫街道，转移妨碍卫生的厕所，每个厕所要挖深，口要小，要加盖，好防蝇子。
    （三）改造猪圈，挖圈坑，猪窝向太阳，猪长得快，又不在街上乱跑，又攒好粪。
    （四）家具水缸，要常洗刷干净。
    （五）消灭虱子臭虫，常洗衣服，晒被晒席。
