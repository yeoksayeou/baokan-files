Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, February 22nd: TASS reports: Women's congresses are being held in cities and villages throughout the Soviet Union to convey and discuss the decisions of the Second International Women's Congress. Newspapers are publishing many articles on the work of the congress and women's issues. Professor Umidova, a female medical doctor from the Uzbek Republic, wrote: I heard representatives from various countries report on the tragic lives of women in Eastern colonies and dependent countries. Indian women are engaged in slave labor and living in semi-starvation; Iranian peasant women are living without legal protection; women in colonial countries are suffering from racial discrimination. When I heard these reports, I couldn't help but think of my own country and the happy lives of our women. The Soviet regime and the Stalin Constitution give women and men in Soviet East completely equal rights to work, rest, and education.

Umidova wrote: During the Tsarist rule, there were virtually no educated women in Uzbekistan. But now, the Soviet regime has created unlimited possibilities for women in Soviet East to receive higher education. For example, I, the daughter of an illiterate woman, am very proud of the education my country has given me. I lecture students at the Uzbek Medical College in the Uzbek national language. There are more than 15,000 Uzbek female students in Soviet higher education institutions. There are 500,000 female students in middle and primary schools. Now, there are 15,000 women representatives in the local Soviets of the Uzbek Republic. One hundred and twenty outstanding daughters of the Uzbek people have been elected as representatives to the Supreme Soviet of the Soviet Union and the Supreme Soviet of the Uzbek Republic. Among these representatives are collective farmers, female workers, actresses, and female scientists. We even have female ministers. At the same time, women in the Uzbek Republic also play an active role in the national economy and are universally valued and respected. Mothers receive universal love and care. In the past four years, the Uzbek Republic has allocated a total of 443 million rubles for maternity subsidies.

　　苏联乌兹贝克共和国
    妇女获得幸福生活
  　中小学女生共达五十万
    【新华社陕北二十二日电】塔斯社讯：全苏各地的城市和乡村正在召开妇女大会，传达并讨论第二届国际妇女大会的决定。报纸上刊登着许多关于大会工作及妇女问题的文章。乌兹贝克共和国的女医学博士、乌米多娃教授写道：我听到各国代表们报告了东方殖民地和附属国妇女的悲惨生活。印度妇女在进行着奴隶劳动，过着半饥饿的生活；伊朗农妇在过着没有法律保障的生活；殖民地国家的妇女都遭受着种族的歧视。当听到这些报告的时候，我不由得不想起我自己的祖国和我国妇女的幸福生活。苏维埃政权与斯大林宪法给予苏维埃东方的妇女和男子完全平等的工作、休息和受教育的权利。
    乌米多娃写道：在沙皇统治时期，乌兹贝克斯坦实际上没有受教育的妇女。而现在，苏维埃政权已经给苏维埃东方妇女创造了受高等教育的无限的可能性。比如我，一个文盲妇人的女儿，很以我的祖国给与我的教育感到骄傲。我用乌兹贝克的民族语言对乌兹贝克医学院的学生讲课。苏联高等教育机关里有一万五千多名乌兹贝克的女学生。中学与小学女学生有五十万人。现在，乌兹贝克共和国的地方苏维埃有一万五千名妇女代表。乌兹贝克人民有一百二十位优秀的女儿被选为苏联最高苏维埃和乌兹贝克共和国最高苏维埃的代表。这些代表当中有集体农妇、女工、女演员和女科学家等。我们并且有女部长。同时乌兹贝克共和国的妇女，在国家经济生活中，也起着积极的作用，并受到普遍的重视与尊重。母亲们受到普遍的爱护与关心。过去四年当中，乌兹贝克共和国一共拨了四亿四千三百万卢布作产妇的补助费。
