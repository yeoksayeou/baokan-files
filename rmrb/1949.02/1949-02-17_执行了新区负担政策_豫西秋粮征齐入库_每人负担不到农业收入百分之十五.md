Xinhua News Agency, Central Plains, 14th. Last year, the autumn public grain in the newly liberated areas of western Henan has been collected and stored. Because the people's government implemented a reasonable burden policy in the new district, the peasants' burden of public grain was greatly reduced compared with the Kuomintang rule. The average burden per person in the whole region is less than 15% of agricultural income. Compared with the Kuomintang rule, the average burden on poor peasants is reduced by about six-fifths, and the average burden on middle peasants is reduced by about four-fifths. The unreasonable situation of large households paying less and small households paying more, and local tyrants and evil gentry not bearing burdens while working peasants bearing more, has been fundamentally changed. When the area carried out the autumn grain levy, it first organized county and district autumn levy committees, convened various meetings and training courses to publicize the victorious situation of the Liberation War and the reasonable burden policy of the people's government, so that cadres could understand the spirit and methods of the reasonable burden policy. Then, the democratic appraisal method was adopted to determine the public grain burden items in various places according to the local conditions. In the villages, the principle of "more grain from those who have more grain, less grain from those who have less grain, and no grain from those who have no grain" was adopted to allocate grain democratically based on land area, output, and living conditions. In the past, evil landlords concealed a large amount of black land and shifted the burden to the peasants. Therefore, when levying grain in this area, peasants in the basic areas launched a struggle to investigate black land. According to incomplete statistics from 13 counties including Luoyang and Yiyang, more than 900,000 mu of black land were investigated. Through this struggle against evil gentry and investigation of black land, the peasants' awareness was raised, and they quickly paid public grain. Generally, in villages, within half a month from the start of collection, about 90% of the public grain had been put into storage. However, because the masses of peasants in various places have not been universally mobilized, the black land has not been completely investigated; and the government's understanding of the wealth of various places is not sufficient, therefore, the burden has not been completely fair and reasonable.

In this public grain levy work, the area gained the following experiences in levying grain in the new district: 1. It must be recognized that the reasonable burden struggle is a democratic struggle between the broad masses of peasants and a small number of illegal landlords. Only by widely publicizing the reasonable burden policy and deeply mobilizing the masses of peasants to investigate black land and oppose unfair distribution, without getting bogged down in clerical work, can the burden be fair and reasonable. 2. Several villages must be selected first for experimentation to create experience and promote it throughout the area. 3. Social order must be stable for grain levy to proceed smoothly. Therefore, before the start of the levy work, it is necessary to vigorously carry out political offensives and suppress bandits, especially in newly occupied areas, which is even more important. 4. Use social forces to promote the collection work. For example, hold symposiums for revolutionary soldiers and family members of staff, symposiums for intellectuals, symposiums for enlightened gentry, etc., to publicize the reasonable burden policy to them in order to obtain their assistance, and organize autumn levy mobilization committees and autumn levy work teams to absorb local poor intellectuals to participate in promoting the collection work.

### 执行了新区负担政策　豫西秋粮征齐入库  每人负担不到农业收入百分之十五

　　执行了新区负担政策
  　豫西秋粮征齐入库
    每人负担不到农业收入百分之十五
    【新华社中原十四日电】河南西部新解放区去年的秋季公粮已经征齐入库。由于人民政府执行了新区合理负担政策，因而农民的公粮负担比国民党统治时期大为减轻。全区平均每人负担不到农业收入的百分之十五，与国民党统治时期比较，贫农平均约减轻六分之五，中农平均约减轻五分之四，并且基本上改变了旧社会那种大户轻小户重，土豪劣绅不负担，劳动农民多负担的不合理情形。该区进行此次秋季征粮工作时，首先组织了县、区秋征委员会，召开各种会议与训练班，宣传解放战争的胜利形势与人民政府的合理负担政策，使干部领会合理负担政策的精神和办法，然后采取民主评议办法按照各地情况，评定各地公粮负担项目，在村里则依照“粮多多出，粮少少出，无粮不出”的原则，按地亩、产量和生活情况民主分派。由于过去恶霸地主隐匿大量黑地，把负担转嫁农民，所以在此地征粮时，基本区各地农民都展开了清查黑地的斗争，清查出大部黑地。据洛阳、伊阳等十三县不完全统计，共清查出黑地九十多万亩。经过这种反对恶霸、清查黑地的斗争，农民觉悟提高，都迅速地缴纳公粮，一般村从布置征收开始，只经过半个月的时间，百分之九十左右的公粮就已入仓。但是，因为各地农民群众还没有普遍地发动起来，所以黑地还没有完全被清查出来；而政府对各地的富力也还了解得不够，因此，负担还没有完全达到公平合理。
    在此次公粮征收工作中，该区得到新区征粮的几点经验如下：一、须认识合理负担斗争是广大农民与少数不法地主的民主斗争，只有广泛宣传合理负担政策，及深入发动农民群众起来清查黑地和反对分配不公，而又不要陷于事务工作中，才能使负担达到公平合理。二、必须首先选择若干村庄进行实验，以创造经验，推广全区。三、社会秩序安定才能顺利进行征粮，因此在征收工作开始以前，要大力开展政治攻势和清剿土匪，特别是在新占领的地区，更为重要。四、运用社会力量推动征收工作。如召开革命军人和工作人员家属座谈会，知识分子座谈会，开明士绅座谈会等，向他们宣传合理负担政策，以取得他们的协助，并组织秋征动员委员会和秋征工作队等吸收当地贫苦的知识分子参加，以推动征收工作的进行。
