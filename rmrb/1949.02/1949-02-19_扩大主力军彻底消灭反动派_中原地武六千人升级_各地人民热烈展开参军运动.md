　　Xinhua News Agency, Central Plains, 17th. In order to expand the main force and thoroughly eliminate the Kuomintang reactionary army, more than 6,000 local armed personnel from Yuwan-Su and Yu-Xi have been honorably promoted to the main force. Two main force regiments of local armed forces of the Third Sub-district of Yuwan-Su and the directly subordinate battalion of the sub-district, totaling more than 4,000 people, after studying current affairs and ideological education, held a ceremony to be upgraded to the field army at the local celebration meeting for the victory of the Huaihai Campaign and the liberation of Tianjin and Beijing. At the meeting, Wang Tongshan, a representative of the soldiers, said: "We request to be upgraded in order to thoroughly eliminate the Kuomintang reactionaries and establish lasting peace." Xu Xilian, Commissioner of the Third Administrative Office, assured the upgraded soldiers that he would do a good job in providing preferential treatment to military families. More than 240 members of the Yanling County Brigade were also honorably promoted to the field army. The upgrading movement of local armed forces in Yu-Xi continues to be carried out, and more than 1,000 people have now been honorably promoted to the field army. After undergoing class education of recalling past suffering and tracing its roots, all 200 members of the Fourth and Fifth Companies of the Chenggao (newly established county, parts of Sishui and Guangwu) County Brigade were upgraded to the field army. Under the leadership of cadres, party members, and activists, all 360 members of the Yichuan Brigade were promoted to the field army. The Baofeng and Jiaxian County Brigades of the Fifth Sub-district, as well as the First Company of the Linru Brigade, also wrote letters to the leaders of the military sub-district, requesting to be upgraded. After the upgrading of local armed forces in various areas, the masses voluntarily signed up to participate in local armed forces to protect local security. In the Miaowan District of Runan County, Yuwan-Su, a new district cadre team was established at the rally to bid farewell to the old district cadre team. After the upgrading of more than 1,500 members of the brigades of Yiyang, Yichuan, Songxian, and Luoning counties in Yu-Xi, more than 2,000 new soldiers have now been added, making the county brigades even larger than before.
    At the same time, the movement to join the army continues to unfold in various areas. In the Yuwan-Su and Tongbai regions, more than 3,000 young people have signed up to join the People's Liberation Army. Since the end of the Huaihai Campaign on January 10th in Yuwan-Su, the people have personally witnessed the great victory of the Huaihai Campaign and the brutal crimes of the Kuomintang bandit army in massacring the people. A large number of young farmers, along with township cadres and model civilian workers supporting the front lines, have signed up to join the army. After returning from serving the Huaihai front lines, the civilian workers of Shuangmiao District, Woyang County, at the district-wide celebration meeting on January 17th, Zhang Zhongqing and Wang Jia, the top-class meritorious workers, took the lead in signing up to join the army, and 68 young civilian workers also automatically signed up. Within ten days, 170 people in the county have joined the army. Farmers in Yanling County enthusiastically joined the army and have formed the "Central Plains Independent Battalion" in preparation for collectively joining the Central Plains Field Army. According to incomplete statistics from the entire Yuwan-Su region, more than 2,000 young adults have joined the army in half a month. The movement to join the army in the Tongbai region has also unfolded one after another. According to statistics from Tangxi County (newly established county, western Tanghe) and Dengbei County (newly established county, northern Deng County) last November and December, more than 1,000 young people have joined the army.

    【新华社中原十七日电】为扩大主力军，以彻底消灭国民党反动军队，豫皖苏、豫西各地地方武装六千多人光荣升级为主力军。豫皖苏三分区地方武装两个主力团与分区直属大队约四千余人经过时事学习和思想教育后，在当地庆祝淮海战役胜利与平津解放的大会上举行升级为野战军的典礼。会上，战士代表王同善说：“我们要求升级，是为了彻底消灭国民党反动派，建立永久的和平。”三专署专员许西连向升级战士保证做好优待军属工作。鄢陵县大队亦有二百四十余人光荣升入野战军。豫西地方武装升级运动继续开展，现又有千余名光荣升入野战军。成皋（新设县，汜水、广武各一部）县大队四、五两连二百人经过诉苦追根的阶级教育后，全体升级到野战军。伊川大队在干部党员和积极分子带头影响下，全体三百六十人升入野战军。五分区宝丰、郏县大队及临汝大队一连亦纷纷写信给军分区首长，要求升级。各地群众在地方武装升级后，为保卫地方治安，又自动报名参加地方武装。豫皖苏汝南县庙湾区在欢送老区干队的大会上，又成立起新的区干队。豫西伊阳、伊川、嵩县、洛宁等县大队一千五百余人升级后，现又有二千余名新战士补充进来，使各县大队较以前更加扩大。
