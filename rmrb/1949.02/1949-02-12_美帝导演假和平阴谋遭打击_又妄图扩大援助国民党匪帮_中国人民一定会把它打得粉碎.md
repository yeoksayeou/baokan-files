Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 10th. Facts show that the United States government is planning to actively aid the Kuomintang reactionaries. U.S. Secretary of the Army Royall, Chief of the Operations and Plans Division of the Department of the Army Weidemei, and other senior U.S. government and Army officials, upon orders, arrived in Tokyo on the first of this month to hold secret meetings with U.S. occupation forces commander in Japan MacArthur, the head of the U.S. Joint Military Advisory Group to the Kuomintang government, Barr, and his chief of staff, Campbell, regarding conspiracies to continue interfering in China's internal affairs and supporting the revival of Japanese forces. Royall publicly admitted in Tokyo on the second of this month that "during their stay in Tokyo, they will discuss the changing situation in China" (according to the Kuomintang Central News Agency). Commander of the U.S. Pacific Fleet, Ramsay, arrived in Shanghai on the fourth of this month and went to Qingdao on the sixth. On the seventh, the U.S. Ambassador to the Nanjing puppet government, Stuart, also flew to Qingdao to hold secret talks with Ramsay and the commander of the U.S. Western Pacific Fleet, Badger, on the Chinese situation. On the eighth, Ramsay flew directly from Qingdao to Tokyo. At the same time, responsible members of the U.S. Congress and government have recently been clamoring for expanded aid to the Kuomintang. The new chairman of the U.S. Congressional Joint Committee on Foreign Aid Oversight, McCarran, publicly stated on January 28, "requesting a $1.5 billion loan to help the Chinese Kuomintang government, with the condition that China (referring to the Kuomintang reactionary traitorous government) accept military supervision from the highest level down" (United Press International Washington). U.S. Economic Cooperation Administration Director Hoffman also stated on the eighth of this month that "he hopes to submit a bill to Congress in early March to extend the aid to China (referring to the Kuomintang) plan," and hinted that the new aid amount is "currently under consideration" (Kuomintang Central News Agency, Washington). The semi-official U.S. New York Times, in its editorial on January 24, exposed the Truman administration's new plan of aggression against China. The newspaper said: "At present, our only way is to wait and see how things develop, and according to President Truman's inaugural address on the 20th, find ways to assist the democratic forces that can still regroup in South China (referring to the Kuomintang traitorous reactionary group)." The American imperialist mouthpiece, Bill of NBC, shouted on January 22: "If the Chinese (referring to the Kuomintang traitors and bandits) still have hope of getting assistance...not just financial and material assistance, but also military guidance to direct combat, then this can change their fate. I think if we just bet $800 million a year, we can stop the Communist tide in China" (U.S. Information Service Washington). Badger's remarks in Qingdao on the third of this month revealed the arrogant plan of the United States to interfere in China's internal affairs under the pretext of protecting American nationals. Badger said: "The Western Pacific Fleet will remain prepared to carry out the responsibilities assigned by the State Department to protect American citizens and important property....Our job is to make Americans feel safe throughout the Chinese coast; where the situation is tense, we are prepared to help the Americans there" (Associated Press). Badger's remarks in Shanghai on the fifth also revealed that the United States is "completely redeploying its naval forces in the China area" (Associated Press). As American imperialism's forces of aggression in China are about to be completely destroyed, and the fake peace conspiracy it orchestrated to preserve the Kuomintang counter-revolutionary forces has been mercilessly struck by the Chinese people, this is why American imperialism is once again advocating expanding aid to the Kuomintang while continuing its political conspiracy. But the people believe that no matter what bets American imperialism makes, it will surely be won cleanly by the great Chinese people.

　　美帝导演假和平阴谋遭打击
  　又妄图扩大援助国民党匪帮       
    中国人民一定会把它打得粉碎
    【新华社陕北十日电】各种事实显示：美国政府正在计划积极援助国民党反动派。美国陆军部长罗雅尔、陆军部作战计划处处长魏特迈与其他美国政府及陆军部高级官员多人，于本月一日衔命到达东京，与美国驻日占领军统帅麦克阿瑟、美国驻国民党政府联合军事顾问团团长巴大维及该团参谋长坎贝尔等，举行关于继续干涉中国内政与扶助日本势力复活的阴谋会议。罗雅尔本月二日在东京公开承认：“渠等一行在东京逗留期间，将讨论正在转变中之中国局势”（据国民党中央社）。美国太平洋舰队司令蓝姆赛于本月四日抵上海，随于六日赴青岛。七日美国驻南京伪政府大使司徒雷登亦飞到青岛，与蓝姆赛及美国西太平洋舰队司令白吉尔等，举行关于中国形势的秘密商谈。八日，蓝姆赛已自青岛迳飞东京。与此同时，美国国会及政府的负责人员最近正纷纷发出扩大援助国民党的叫嚣。新任美国会援外监督联合委员会主席麦卡伦于上月二十八日公开声明：“要求以十五亿美元贷款帮助中国国民党政府，附带条件为要求中国（指国民党反动卖国政府）接受自最高级以下的军事监督”（合众社华盛顿电）。美国经济合作总署署长霍夫曼亦于本月八日声明，“渠希望三月初向国会提出法案，延长援华（指国民党）计划”，并暗示新的援助款额“刻正拟议中”（国民党中央社华盛顿电）。半官方的美国纽约时报，在上月二十四日的社论中，暴露了杜鲁门政府的新的侵华计划。该报说：“目下我们唯一的办法只有静观演变，并依照杜鲁门总统二十日的就职演词，设法援助仍能在华南再度集合的民主势力（按指国民党卖国反动集团）。”美国帝国主义的传声筒、美国广播公司的比尔在上月廿二日喊道：“如果中国人（按指国民党卖国贼匪帮）还有希望得到援助……不只是金钱与物资的援助，还有指导作战的军事指导，那么这还可以改变他们的命运。我想我们只要一年下八亿美元的赌注，就可阻止中国共产主义的狂潮”（美国新闻处华盛顿电）。本月三日白吉尔在青岛的谈话，则暴露出美国准备在所谓保护美侨的借口下武装干涉中国内政的狂妄计划。白吉尔说：“西太平洋舰队仍将准备实行国务院所交给的保护美侨和重要财产的职责。……我们的工作是使整个中国沿海的美国人感到安全，那里的形势紧张，我们就准备帮助那里的美侨”（合众社）。白吉尔五日在上海的谈话又透露，美国正在“整个地重新部署中国区的海军力量”（美联社）。美国帝国主义在中国的侵略势力眼看着就要全部灭亡了，它为了保存国民党反革命势力而一手导演的假和平阴谋也遭到了中国人民的无情打击，这就是美国帝国主义在继续其政治阴谋的同时从新鼓吹扩大援助国民党的原因。但是人民相信：不论美国帝国主义下怎样的赌注，都一定要被伟大的中国人民赢得干干净净。
