Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 27th: The China National Salvation Association issued a statement on the current situation, entitled "We Demand Thorough and Genuine Peace," the full text of which is as follows:

Recently, the atmosphere of peace in Nanjing, Shanghai, and other places has suddenly become thick. The war criminal Chiang Kai-shek issued a New Year's Day message seeking peace, followed by the puppet Executive Yuan announcing a resolution of "ceasefire first, then peace talks." At the same time, some puppet senators, etc., who support "suppressing the rebellion," echoed the call for "peace," claiming that this was for the benefit of the people.

Why is it that the "rebellion" instigator who tore up the Political Consultative Conference resolutions, destroyed the ceasefire and troop reorganization and other peace agreements, and brazenly launched a full-scale civil war, now actually puts forward a "peace" proposal? Obviously, today, the People's Liberation Army led by the Communist Party of China has achieved unprecedented victory, and the reactionary rule is about to collapse entirely. The people under this reactionary rule have been "suppressed" to the point where they can no longer survive. Everyone hates war and opposes war. Therefore, issuing a "peace" lament at this time, their attempt is very obvious, that is, to try to缓和the offensive of the Liberation Army, preserve the remaining reactionary forces, buy time to catch their breath, and obscure the people's consciousness, paralyzing the people's resistance.

On the 19th of this month, the Nanjing puppet Executive Yuan resolved to advocate for an unconditional ceasefire between the two sides, followed by peace talks. Then Chiang Kai-shek issued a message announcing his "retirement." At this point, the Nanjing reactionary group's "peace" posture is becoming more and more realistic. However, the people's eyes are discerning. Now that their remaining "bandit suppression" troops have collapsed and can no longer withstand a single blow, to advocate "unconditional ceasefire between the two sides first" is actually to ask the People's Liberation Army to stop unconditionally, in order to preserve the remaining strength of the Chiang Kai-shek group and preserve half of the anti-revolutionary rule south of the Yangtze River. This is a very vicious conspiracy and has nothing to do with genuine peace. We believe that genuine peace must be premised on destroying the entire rule of the Kuomintang reactionary group, and must also be premised on the realization of Mr. Mao Zedong's eight peace conditions. To want to ceasefire first and then discuss these conditions proves that there is no sincerity for peace. Even if Chiang Kai-shek personally steps down, if the Nanjing reactionary government does not first accept the eight conditions, it will still be of no avail. All the people of China deeply love peace, and the compatriots who cannot survive under the reactionary rule of the Kuomintang are even more eager for peace. However, the peace that the people want is definitely not the disguised peace of the Chiang Kai-shek and Li Zongren group, the peace that preserves the reactionary remnants, but a thorough peace, a genuine peace. Mr. Mao Zedong, Chairman of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China, put forward eight conditions, advocating the abolition of Chiang Kai-shek's "legal authority" and his "constitution," reorganizing his army, punishing war criminals, etc., all of which are the unanimous wishes of the people of the whole country, and are the minimum conditions for achieving thorough and genuine peace. This is truly a matter of common sentiment and common sense. Our association has always advocated that the interests of the people are above all else. We express our extreme support for this kind of proposition to seek genuine peace and thorough peace for the people. If the Nanjing reactionary group is truly sincere about peace and has a little conscience for the suffering of the people, it should immediately accept and implement everything thoroughly, then the war can be stopped and genuine peace can be achieved.

The Northeast, North China, and other liberated areas that have now been liberated have all achieved genuine and thorough peace. The people live and work in peace and contentment, production is developing rapidly, industry and commerce are thriving, and society is booming. Compared with the darkness, suffering, hunger, and chaos in the Kuomintang-controlled areas, it has just become a stark contrast. Without thorough and genuine peace, and with the preservation of reactionary remnants, this situation can never be achieved. Therefore, if the reactionary rule of the Kuomintang is not thoroughly destroyed, genuine peace can never be achieved, social reforms can never be carried out, and the people's lives can never be improved. Therefore, we must adhere to the minimum eight conditions, and the compatriots in the Kuomintang-controlled areas should also unite and coordinate actions, and insist on urging thorough and genuine peace. We must not be complacent or procrastinate, lest we leave behind enormous future troubles.

We especially want to call on our compatriots to pay attention. Although American imperialism has recently hypocritically declared "non-interference in China's internal affairs," in reality, its support for the remaining military forces of the Kuomintang, support for local reactionary forces in various remote provinces, and all conspiracies to create "liberalism" and "middle-of-the-road" groups to divide and alienate the revolutionary democratic front are being carried out without a moment's relaxation. We want to solemnly declare that only the Chinese people themselves have the right to handle Chinese affairs. We must call on compatriots across the country to give a head-on blow to all imperialist overt or covert, direct or indirect interference.

Compatriots: The thorough and genuine peace, the lasting and democratic peace, that the people of the whole country yearn for will soon be fully realized. Let us bravely fight for the realization of such peace!

### 中国人民救国会发表时局声明  人民要的是真正的和平　决不要南京的伪装和平

　　全国各民主党派团体一致拥护毛主席对时局声明
    中国人民救国会发表时局声明
    人民要的是真正的和平
  　决不要南京的伪装和平
    【新华社陕北二十七日电】中国人民救国会发表时局声明，题为“我们要求彻底真正的和平”，全文如下：
    最近宁沪等地和平空气突见浓厚。战犯头子蒋介石发出元旦求和文告于前，伪行政院又公布“先停战后和谈”的决议于后，而同时一些拥护“戡乱”的伪参议员等，也随声附和，高唱“和平”，口口声声说这是为了人民的利益。
    为什么撕毁政协决议，破坏停战整军等和平协定，悍然发动全国内战的“戡乱”祸首，现在居然也提出“和平”主张来呢？显然的，今天中国共产党领导的人民解放军空前胜利，反动统治即将整个崩溃，而这个反动统治下的人民已被“戡”的再也活不下去，大家都厌恶战争，反对战争。因此，在这个时候发出“和平”哀鸣，他们的企图是十分明显的，那只是希图和缓解放大军的进攻，保存残余反动势力，争取喘息时间，及模糊人民意识，麻痹人民的反抗而已。
    本月十九日，南京伪行政院决议主张双方先行无条件停战，然后举行和谈。接着蒋介石又发表文告宣布“引退”。至此南京反动集团的“和平”姿态，是做的愈加逼真了。然而人民的眼睛是雪亮的，在他们的残余“剿民”军队业已土崩瓦解，再也不堪一击的现在，来主张“双方先行无条件停战”，实际上是要人民解放军无条件止步，以便保存蒋介石集团的残余力量，保全长江以南反革命统治的半壁江山。这是一个非常毒辣的阴谋，与真正的和平没有什么相干。我们认为：真正的和平必须以摧毁整个国民党反动集团之统治为前提，也必须以毛泽东先生的八项和平条件之实现为前提。要想先停战而后商谈这些条件，那就证明没有和平的诚意。纵令蒋介石个人下野，而假如南京反动政府不先接受八项条件，那也仍旧无济于事。全中国人民无不酷爱和平，而在国民党反动统治下活不下去的同胞，更万分渴望和平。但是人民所要的和平，决不是蒋介石、李宗仁集团这种伪装的和平，保存反动残余的和平，而是要彻底的和平，真正的和平。中国共产党中央委员会主席毛泽东先生提出八项条件，主张废除蒋介石的“法统”，及其“宪法”，改编其军队，惩办战犯等等，都是全国人民一致的愿望，而为实现彻底真正的和平的最低限度的条件。这真所谓人同此心，心同此理。本会一贯主张人民利益高于一切，对于此种为人民谋求真正和平，彻底和平的主张，我们极表赞成。南京反动集团如果真有和平的诚意，稍有顾念人民痛苦的良心，应该立即全部接受彻底执行，然后战争方停得下来，真正的和平才能实现。
    现在已经解放的东北、华北以及其他各解放地区，都已得到真正的、彻底的和平，人民安居乐业，生产发展猛进，工商发达，社会蓬勃，以与国民党统治区黑暗、悲苦、饥饿、混乱的情形相比，刚刚成为强烈的对照。如果没有彻底的真正的和平，仍保存着反动残余，决不能达此境地。因此，国民党反动统治如不予彻底摧毁，真正的和平决不能实现，社会改革决不能进行，人民生活决不能改善。所以我们一定要坚持最低限度的八项条件，国民党统治区的同胞，也应共同起来，配合行动，并坚持督促彻底的真正的和平，决不能稍有姑息，因循坐误，致贻莫大的后患。
    我们尤其要唤起同胞们注意，美帝国主义最近虽假惺惺地声明“不干涉中国内政”，实际上他的支援国民党残余军事力量，支援各个边远省份的地方反动势力，以及制造“自由主义”、“中间路线”集团、以分化离间革命民主阵线的一切阴谋，是一刻也不放松地在进行的。我们要特别郑重地声明，中国的事只有中国人民自己有权利处理，一切帝国主义的公开或隐蔽的、直接或间接的干涉，我们都要号召全国同胞起来予以迎头痛击。
    同胞们：全国人民所渴望的彻底的真正的和平，持久的、民主的和平，不久即将完全实现。让我们为实现这样的和平而勇敢奋斗吧！
  　　　　　　中国人民救国会　三十八年一月二十四日
