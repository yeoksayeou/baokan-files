Xinhua News Agency, East China, 11th: The Bohai First Stretcher-Bearer Regiment of the Bohai First Military Subdistrict (administering seven counties including Leling and Nanpi) was commended as a model stretcher-bearer regiment by the East China Frontline Support Committee when it was demobilized last month. On January 23rd, it held a grand celebration and award ceremony for over 3,000 members, rewarding 524 model civilian laborers who observed battlefield discipline and mass discipline, obeyed commands, cared for the wounded, and resolutely completed all tasks. The regiment's civilian laborers served with the army for a total of eight months, traversing approximately 10,000 li through five provinces: Hebei, Shandong, Jiangsu, Anhui, and Henan. During this time, they were present on the front lines of every major battle to rescue the wounded. The exemplary deeds of the regiment can be summarized as follows: (1) Universal care for the wounded. For example, when transporting the wounded in winter, the civilian laborers, fearing the wounded would get cold, prepared three or four large padded coats for each stretcher, while the laborers themselves only wore a set of military uniforms. After the Jinan Campaign, the army gave each civilian laborer two packs of biscuits, but the laborers saved them for the wounded. They also regularly prepared rock sugar, brown sugar, and white sugar to mix with water for the wounded. When the wounded called out hungry at night, the civilian laborers volunteered to cook for them. (2) Good mass discipline and meticulous and in-depth mass work. Each company in the regiment had a "Love the People Group" that led the whole company in resident work. When the regiment was stationed in the Shili Pu area of Jiaxiang County, southwestern Shandong, it helped all the middle and poor peasants harvest crops, saving a large number of crops that were waterlogged in the fields. In total, since the civilian laborers began their service, they helped farmers cut sorghum, harvest grain, and weed a total of 8,100 mu, planted vegetables on 78 mu, carried manure over 4,000 times, and repaired houses and built kang beds 2,700 times. In addition, they also helped farmers grind flour, press wheat, and repair furniture and spinning wheels, earning the deep love of the residents in the stationed areas. Residents in various places subsequently presented them with 59 banners of various colors. (3) Good battlefield discipline, with all spoils turned over to the public. For example, when the Huang Wei Corps was annihilated last December, a large number of cotton clothes and military caps were captured on the battlefield. Although the civilian laborers were thinly dressed at the time, not a single one privately used them. (4) Resolute execution of tasks. For example, a squad from the first company of the fifth battalion once transported the wounded 120 li continuously without eating. During the Jinan Campaign, many civilian laborers did not sleep for four consecutive days and nights. At that time, the slogan among the civilian laborers in the regiment was: "We will not rest until all the wounded are carried away!" The reasons why the regiment's civilian laborers were able to perform so well were: (1) The cadres and CCP members in the regiment fully played an exemplary role. The regiment's and battalion's CCP committees frequently educated Party members through the branch, understood the situation, and promptly resolved problems among the Party member civilian laborers. Most leading cadres personally participated in carrying stretchers, caring for the wounded, and inspecting food. Party members generally performed tasks before resting, so in the democratic appraisal of merit, Party members accounted for 80 percent of the total number of national heroes. (2) Each platoon and squad formulated merit plans, competed with each other, and inspected each other. Model behavior was immediately commended and rewarded, and violations of discipline were promptly criticized and corrected. (3) The army cared for the civilian laborers. The army's regimental and battalion leaders often personally inquired about whether the civilian laborers had houses to live in and whether they had enough food. The army also sent special personnel to prepare supplies for the civilian laborers. When marching, the good roads were given to the civilian laborers, and the army itself took the bad roads. Whether at the front or in the rear, the army frequently educated the civilian laborers on how to defend against air raids and poison gas, and how to dig air raid shelters. When civilian laborers were sick, military doctors immediately went to treat them. In this way, the relationship between the army and the civilian laborers became even more united, and the civilian laborers showed even greater bravery in rescuing the wounded. (4) The battalion and company food management and sanitation work were well done. Each company ensured that civilian laborers could eat meat once or twice a month and that they did not drink cold water at any time. Each company saved money on food expenses and used the savings to purchase cotton pants for the civilian laborers in advance, ensuring that the civilian laborers would not freeze. Therefore, there were very few sick personnel within the regiment during the eight months of deployment.

　　遵守战场纪律坚决完成任务
  　渤海第一担架团受奖
    干部和党员起模范立功竞赛偿罚分明
    【新华社华东十一日电】渤海一分区（辖乐陵南皮等七县）第一担架团于上月复员时为华东支援前线委员会评奖为模范担架团后，于一月二十三日召开了全团三千余人的盛大的庆功授奖大会，奖励了五百二十四名遵守战场纪律和群众纪律、服从指挥、爱护伤员、坚决完成一切任务的模范民工。该团民工随军服务前后共八个月，经历了河北、山东、江苏、安徽、河南等五个省，共约一万余里，其间每个重大战役均亲临前线抢救伤员。总结全团模范事迹，有如下数端：（一）普遍爱护伤员。例如冬季转运伤员时，民工怕伤员受冷，每付担架给备三、四件大袄，而民工自己只穿一套军衣。济南战役后军队送给民工每人两包饼干，民工们都留着给伤员吃。平时还经常备着冰糖、红糖、白糖给伤员冲水喝。伤员晚上叫饿，民工自告奋勇替伤员煮饭。（二）群众纪律良好，群众工作细致深入。该团每连都有爱民小组，领导着全连的居民工作。该团驻在鲁西南嘉祥县十里铺一带时，曾帮助当地所有中农、贫农收庄稼，使涝在地里的大批庄稼得救。总计该团民工服务以来，帮助农民砍高粱、割谷子和锄草共八千一百亩，种菜七十八亩，抬粪四千余次，修房打炕二千七百次，此外还帮助农民推磨、压碾、修理家具和纺车，深得驻地居民爱戴，各地居民为此先后献给他们五十九面各种各色的旗子。（三）战场纪律良好，缴获归公，如去年十二月消灭黄维兵团时，战场上缴获大批棉衣军帽，民工们当时虽然衣衫单薄，没有一个民工私自动用。（四）执行任务坚决。如五营一连某次转运伤员，未吃饭连续走了一百廿里；济南战役时，很多民工接连四天四夜没有睡觉。当时该团民工中的口号是：“伤员不抬完决不休息！”该团民工所以能有这样良好表现，其原因是：（一）团中干部和中共党员充分发挥了模范作用。该团团、营中共党委经常通过支部教育党员，了解情况，及时解决党员民工中的问题。领导干部大多数都曾亲身参加抬担架，照顾伤员，检查伙食，一般党员尤其普遍地执行任务在前，休息在后，故在民主评功中党员被评为功臣者占全国功臣总数的百分之八十。（二）各排各班订立功计划，互相竞赛，互相检查，发现模范行为马上表扬奖励，发现违犯纪律现象则及时予以批评纠正。（三）军队关心民工。军队的团、营首长经常亲自前去询问民工有房子住吗？粮食够吃吗？军队并派专人替民工筹备给养。行军的时候，好路让民工走，军队自己走坏路。无论前线与后方，军队经常教育民工如何防空、防毒，挖防空壕。民工有病，军医马上前去诊治。这样，军队和民工的关系更臻团结，民工抢救伤员就更表现奋不顾身。（四）营、连伙食管理和卫生工作做得好。各连曾保证民工每月能够吃到一二次肉，保证民工平时不喝凉水。各连菜金都有节约，将节约所得提前为民工购置棉裤，保证民工不受冻。因此，该团前后出征八个月内病员很少。
