　　Northeast's Treasure Trove
    Northeast's mineral resources, especially the astonishing reserves of coal and iron, known as the foundation of heavy industry, occupy a very important position in China and the world. Here are the world-renowned coal capital Fushun, the iron capital Benxi, and countless glittering gold mines on the banks of the Heilongjiang River.
    Coal, known as "industrial bread," ranks first among Northeast's mineral products. The Northeast has over five hundred and fifty coal mines, large and small. The main ones are Fushun, Benxi, Xi'an, Fuxin, Hegang, Mishan, Dongning, Jiaohe, Shulan, Hunchun, Xifeng, Tianshifu, Tonghua, etc. As for its reserves, according to a 1932 survey by the enemy's "South Manchurian Railway Geological Survey," it was estimated at 4.8 billion tons. After several surveys up to 1937, the judgment was nearly 10 billion tons – 7.272 billion tons. It seems that with each survey, the number increases. Undoubtedly, the current figure is still calculated under insufficient investigation or poor methods. Therefore, the actual number of Northeast's coal treasure is still a surprising unknown.
    Most of the coal mines in Northeast are young and have great potential. Taking Fushun, which has a longer history, as an example, it has a total of 1 billion tons of coal reserves, but only one-tenth of it has been mined so far – about 80 to 90 million tons, with at least 900 million tons still buried. The coal seam in Fushun Coal Mine is very thick, initially 350 meters deep, and after digging to dozens of meters, another measurement showed it to be about 650 meters deep. Most of it is now mined by "open-pit mining," and the output is very impressive. According to statistics during the enemy puppet regime, the annual output was nearly 100,000 tons.
    Northeast coal can be divided into four types: anthracite, lignite, bituminous coal, and coking coal. Anthracite is mostly produced in Fuzhou, Yantai, and other places, totaling 130 million tons, accounting for about 2% of the total reserves in Northeast. Lignite is about 430 million tons, accounting for 6% of the total reserves. So, apart from anthracite and lignite, the remaining is bituminous coal, accounting for about 92%. Among bituminous coal, coking coal accounts for 24%, about 1.5 billion tons. This type of coal is the best raw material for manufacturing industrial coking coal.
    Having coal, and then having iron, is equivalent to having everything. It enables the construction of heavy industry and military industry, strengthening national defense and increasing wealth. And Northeast happens to be rich in iron resources. It is estimated that at least 1 billion tons of iron are buried. In Benxi alone, the iron reserves are 626.5 million tons, with an annual output of about 300,000 to 400,000 tons. Northeast has the world-famous Anshan Iron and Steel Plant and Benxi Iron and Steel Plant, which are treasures of China's industry and a strong material foundation for China's industrialization. Now under the control of the people, they will exert their great power.
    Gold is the most precious of all metals. The Yalu River, Songhua River, Heilongjiang River… on both sides of the great rivers in Northeast are treasure lands for gold production. Northern Manchuria alone contains more than 3.5 million metric tons of gold. In the past, tens of thousands of taels of gold could be produced annually. In the past, these were the properties of mine owners and Japanese bandits. They used these to exploit the people. In the spring, they put workers into the mountain gullies, led in river water, and police blocked the mountain passes, prohibiting entry and exit. The workers panned for gold for them, coming out empty-handed in the autumn. Now, this gold belongs to the people and is used for the people.
    In addition, Fushun also produces oil shale that can distill tens of thousands of tons of high-quality gasoline every year. Dashiqiao contains 20 billion tons of magnesite ore, and there are vast reserves of refractory clay, as well as silver, lead, zinc, copper, talc, asbestos, etc.
    Northeast's mineral resources are rich and diverse enough, inexhaustible and inexhaustible for the construction of heavy industry, chemical industry, the development of various industries, and fuel. Since Chiang Kai-shek sold Northeast to Japanese imperialism seventeen years ago, Japanese bandits used the labor of the Chinese people to greedily develop these mineral deposits, and used them to manufacture cannons and tanks, slaughtering countless of our compatriots, rampaging across half of Asia for several years. Later, the American and Chiang Kai-shek reactionaries also came to covet, but after three years of fighting, the people defended and liberated these treasures, and will vigorously develop these great treasures. Everything can develop as long as it belongs to the people, and the power of the people can conquer everything. Now, the mines in Northeast have rapidly recovered and entered large-scale production. The average daily productivity of each worker has reached 0.5 tons, exceeding 67% of the pseudo-Manchu period. This year alone, the four mining areas in Northern Manchuria will produce 5 million tons of coal. The newly liberated Fushun and Benxi will also show their great power on the production front with a new look.
    Treasure house Northeast is pouring out her hidden boundless power as much as possible for her people and the whole of China.

### 东北的宝藏

　　东北的宝藏
    东北的矿产，特别是被称为重工业之基础的煤与铁的惊人的埋藏量，在全中国和全世界上都是处于非常重要的地位的。这里有名震全球的煤都抚顺、铁都本溪和黑龙江畔无数闪砾的金矿。
    被称为“工业面包”的煤，占东北矿产首位。——全东北大大小小有五百五十几个煤矿，主要的几个是抚顺、本溪、西安、阜新、鹤冈、密山、东宁、蛟河、舒兰、珲春、西丰、田师付、通化等。至于它的埋藏量，据敌“满铁地质调查所”一九三二年的调查，推定它是四十八亿吨。其后截至一九三七年又经几次调查，判断的结果，几近百亿吨——七十二亿七千二百万吨，这样看来，每调查一次，它的数目便要增加一次：无疑的现在的数目字，还是在调查不足或方法不良之下计算出来的，所以东北煤的宝藏的实际数目字，还是一个惊人的未知数。
    东北的煤矿大都是年轻的煤矿，很有前途。以历史较久的抚顺为例，该处共埋藏煤炭十亿吨，而至今仅不过开采了其中的十分之一——八、九千万吨左右，至少还埋藏着九亿吨。抚顺煤矿煤层很厚，最初深三百五十米，挖至数十余米后。再加测量则深约六百五十余米，现大部采用“露天掘”，产量非常惊人，据敌伪统治时代之统计，年产近十万吨。
    东北煤炭可分四种：无烟煤、褐煤、沥青煤、黏性煤。无烟煤多出于复州、烟台等地，总计一亿三千吨，约占全东北总埋藏量的百分之二，褐煤约四亿三千万吨，占总埋藏量的百分之六。这样除了无烟煤和褐煤，剩下的便是沥青煤了，约占百分之九十二的样子。而沥青煤中黏性煤又占百分之二十四，约为十五亿吨。这种煤是制造工业用焦煤的最好原料。
    已经有了煤，如果再有了铁，那就等于有了一切，就可以建设重工业，就可以建设军事工业，加强国防，增加财富。而东北，恰恰又是铁的富源，至今推算至少约埋藏着十亿吨铁，仅本溪一地，铁的储藏量就是六亿二千六百五十万吨，每年产铁约三四十万吨。东北有着名驰全球的鞍山炼钢厂，本溪炼钢厂，这都是中国工业之宝，是中国走向工业化的有力的物质基础。现在在人民掌握下，它们将发挥其巨大威力。
    黄金，这是一切金属中最贵重的。东北的鸭绿江、松花江、黑龙江……大江两岸，尽是产金宝地，仅仅北满，就埋藏了三百五十余万公吨的黄金。过去每年即可产数万两黄金。过去这些都是矿主和日本强盗们的财产，他们用这来榨取人民，他们春天把工人放进山沟，引进江水，警察堵住山口，禁止出入，工人在里给他们淘金子，一直到秋天，两手空空的走出来。现在这些黄金都归于人民，用于人民了。
    除此而外，抚顺还出产着每年可以蒸溜出数万吨优等汽油的油母页岩。大石桥地方埋藏着二百亿吨的菱苦土矿，有莫大埋藏量的耐火黏土、有银、铅、亚铅、铜、滑石、石绵等。
    东北的矿产是够丰富的，够多样的，无论是建设重工业，化学工业，开发各种产业以及燃料等等，都是取之不尽用之不绝的。自从十七年前蒋介石把东北出卖给日本帝国主义后，日本强盗曾用中国人民的劳动，贪婪的开发了这些矿藏，并利用它制造了大炮、坦克，屠杀了我们无数同胞，在半个亚洲横冲直撞了数年之久，后来美蒋反动派又来＠涎，但经三年战斗，人民保卫了解放了这些宝藏，并将大力开发这些伟大的宝藏，一切东西只要归了人民，它就能发展，人民的力量能征服一切，现在东北各矿，已迅速恢复并进入大规模生产，每个工人的每日平均生产率已达零点五吨，超过伪满时百分之六十七。仅北满四矿区今年即可产煤五百万吨，新解放的抚顺、本溪，也将以新的姿态在生产战线上大显威力。
    宝库东北，正为她的人民和全中国，尽量倾出她埋藏着的无限力量。
