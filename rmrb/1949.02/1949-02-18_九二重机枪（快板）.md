　　The Type 92 Heavy Machine Gun (Clapper Talk)
    Second Battalion Machine Gun Company, Special Service Regiment  Xie Zhongmou
     Clapperboard rings, I start to speak,
     To tell of the Type 92 heavy machine gun, unique.
     This gun was originally made in Japan,
     The factory was called Okura, that's the plan;
     Eight years of resistance against Japan's fight,
     Combat captured, we carried it with all our might.
     Other things, I won't explain,
     But,
     The function of its parts, I'll lay plain;
     The first major part is the tail tube base,
     With several small parts in their place,
     Grip, press iron, transmission plate,
     Also reverse hook, active spring, and such fate,
     Its function is to control the shot,
     Thumb presses, and the gun is hot.

     There's also the bolt buffer, you see,
     To prevent damage to the mechanism, glee.
     The first major part is told,
     The second major part, now unfold;
     The automatic firing device makes it sing,
     Piston, upper bolt, and cylinder cling,
     Piston rod inside hides a return spring,
     Cylinder has a firing pin hole, a necessary thing,
     Also a pawl hook and a pressing spring.
     Piston rod,
     Drives the bolt cylinder to and fro, quite odd,
     Only then can the firing pin do its job, by God.

     Cylinder's function is even greater, it's true,
     The firing pin is held right in the center, anew.
     Ensuring the firing pin doesn't bend or stray,
     Straight and true, come what may.
     Pawl hook and pressing spring play a role so keen,
     Topping the bullet, sending it into the firing chamber, serene.
     Thumb presses, and the fire's begun,
     Shell casings bounce onto the ground, one by one.
     The third part is the tail tube section, in sight,
     Small parts, every one, brought to light.
     Inside there's a reverse hook bolt chamber, you see,
     The sight base is made strong, certainly.
     Sight rises and falls, screw adjusts high and low,
     Scale.
     Rotating wheel, main board, distance division window, aglow.
     Pushing it back and forth with glee,
     The sight can rise, and fall, you see.
     Above there's a scope mount, so fine,
     Mount a scope, aiming becomes divine.
     The scope mount comes with a cover,
     With screws to control the hover.
     There's also something called a toothed arc plate,
     Like a saw blade, sealed by fate.
     Sets the height to control up and down,
     Up and down height is firmly found.
     The ejector body looks like a mandarin hat, it's grand,
     It kicks out shell casings from the chamber, across the land,
     The fourth part is the feeding mechanism, it's true,
     A stopper mechanism, mounted anew,
     It controls,
     The piston rod's retreat to stop and start, a view.
     Bullet seat sends the bullet, you see,
     Bullet plate swings to the left, with glee.
     Feeding wheel,
     Helps the bullet plate send the bullet, feel.
     The fifth part is the oil trough, you know,
     The oil trough wood is for holding oil, don't you know,
     With a brush and oil guide on top,
     To oil the plate and induction chamber, non-stop,
     Brush and oil guide apply the oil, so neat,
     In the induction chamber, there's an induction seat.
     The oil trough lid covers, so oil won't leak,
     Ejection port cover prevents dust, so meek.
     The sixth part is the gun body, clear and grand,
     Divided into small parts, discussed across the land:
     The heat shield allows heat to escape, so free,
     This is one small part, you see.
     The gas vent hole plays a role so large,
     Gas power comes from here, to charge,
     Inside the barrel, there are rifling lines,
     The bullet spins, traveling straight, it shines.
     The seventh part has a heat shield tube,
     Holds parts and dissipates heat, it's true,
     Above, there's a machine ear gas cylinder,
     Heat shield gas regulator, surrender.
     Fixed screw gun body locking ring,
     Close to the gun body, firmly clinging.
     Gas cylinder,
     Holds the piston rod, moving back and forth, so slender,
     Driving the automatic firing mechanism, in rapid endeavor.
     The eighth part is the gun body mount, so bold,
     Stabilizes the gun body, can't be told.
     Aiming mechanism is highly efficient, so fine,
     Directional aiming sets the position, so divine.
     The ninth part is the elevation axis, so steep,
     Gun goes up and down, high or low, so deep,
     Above, there's a direction graduation plate,
     Scanning angle avoids discrepancies, sealed by fate.
     The tenth part is the foot frame, sturdy and keen,
     Elevation axis inserted into its waist, serene,
     Elevation wheel locking rod, firm and true,
     Front and rear three foot pillars, that's the view,
     The eleventh part, three legs, you see,
     Thighs inserted into the foot frame, carefree,
     Supporting the gun body, convenient to use, glee.
     Each part matches into a block,
     Then it can strike the enemy, Oh! Oh!
     Comrades,
     I wrote this clapper talk,
     Not for its beauty or catchy walk;
     Specially for comrades to remember with ease,
     A long lesson is hard to seize,
     Written as clapper talk, easy to please,
     Don't treat it as an ordinary piece,
     This is to help military studies, if you please.
     Everyone, create more in the future, no doubt,
     Master the weapons in your hands, all about!

　　九二重机枪（快板）
    特务团二营机枪连  谢忠谋
     呱打板一响开了腔，
     表一表九二重机枪。
     这枪本是日本造，
     工厂名字叫大仓；
     八年抗战打日本，
     战斗缴获咱扛上。
     别的事情咱不表，
     咱把那，
     机件作用说端详；
     第一大部分尾筒底，
     若干小部配搭上，
     握把押铁传道板，
     还有逆钩活笱簧，
     它的作用管射击，
     拇指一压就开枪。
     还有闩子缓冲器，
     防止机关撞损伤。
     第一大部说完了，
     第二大部紧接上；
     连发机管连发响，
     活塞上闩子和圆筒，
     活塞杆内藏复坐簧，
     圆筒内有撞针孔，
     还有扒子钩和那压板簧。
     活塞捍，
     推动闩子圆筒前后闯，
     撞针才能击发忙。
     圆筒作用更是大，
     撞针按在正中央。
     保管撞针不歪动，
     不歪不邪正当阳。
     扒子钩压板簧用处不小，
     头顶着子弹送入弹膛。
     拇指一压发了火，
     弹壳蹦到平地上。
     三大部分是尾筒部，
     小零件件件都说上。
     内有逆钩闩子室，
     标尺带座做的强。
     标尺升降螺杆高低分划
     尺。
     转轮主板距离分划窗。
     把它前后来推动，
     标尺能升又能降。
     上边有个眼镜座，
     装上镜子瞄准强。
     镜子座上带盖板，
     有螺丝管着逛档。
     还有一件叫齿弧板，
     好象锯条一般样。
     定高低来管上下，
     上下高低定的强。
     蹴子体好象相公帽，
     它管蹴出弹壳出枪膛，
     第四大部是送弹机，
     碍子机，按配上，
     他管着，
     活塞杆后退停开关。
     送弹子座送弹子，
     枪弹板拨到左边。
     送弹轮，
     帮助枪弹板送子弹。
     第五大部是油槽，
     油槽木是盛油的，
     上有毛刷油导子，
     给油板和诱导室，
     毛刷油导把油抹，
     诱导室里有诱导子。
     油槽盖盖着油不漏，
     蹴出口盖防尘土。
     第六大部是枪身，
     分成小部谈的真：
     防热面来能放热，
     这是其中一小部分。
     瓦斯漏孔作用大，
     瓦斯力量从此出，
     枪筒内有来复线，
     子弹旋转走的直。
     第七大部有防热筒，
     收容零件和放热的，
     上有机耳瓦斯筒，
     防热面瓦斯规正器。
     固定螺斗枪身紧定环，
     紧靠枪身固定的。
     瓦斯筒，
     收容活塞杆前后动，
     推动连发起运动急。
     第八大部枪身孔架，
     稳定枪身不能移。
     瞄准机件能高效，
     方向瞄准定位置。
     第九大部升降轴，
     枪身上下高或低，
     上有方向分划板，
     扫射角度免差异。
     第十大部脚头架，
     升降轴插在它腰里，
     升降转轮紧定杆，
     前后三个脚柱子，
     十一大部三只脚，
     大腿插在脚头架内，
     架着枪身使用便利。
     各大部分对成块，
     就能以打的敌人噢噢
     的。同志们，
     我编这个快板，
     不为好听和好唱；
     专为同志们好记的，
     一大篇课文不好记，
     写成快板记容易，
     休把它当作寻常段，
     这是帮助军事学习。
     大家今后多创作，
     熟练掌握手中武器！
