Xinhua News Agency, Beiping, February 13th: Beiping's broad masses of students are participating in various social activities and studying with an unprecedentedly joyous mood. Student representatives from eight universities and colleges, including Peking University, Tsinghua University, Yenching University, Sino-French University, Fu Jen Catholic University, Normal University, Chaoyang University, and the Railway Management College, gathered on the 9th in the Peking University building to initiate the establishment of the Beiping Student Union, in order to participate in the North China Student Federation, and it is scheduled to convene a representative conference of Beiping's middle school and university students before the 20th. Under the leadership of the "Beiping Student United Association for Celebrating the Liberation of Beiping," the major middle school and university students are going to the streets and alleys to carry out extensive propaganda through lectures, songs, wall newspapers, cartoons, etc., which has been warmly welcomed by the citizens, especially workers, vendors, and shop assistants. At the famous Qianmen Railway Station, the students used "crosstalk," a form familiar to the people of Beiping, to explain that the great victories of the People's Liberation Army in Jinzhou, Shenyang, Xuzhou, Zhangjiakou, and Tianjin were the main reasons for the peaceful liberation of Beiping. Many onlookers shouted, "That's right!" Within the various schools, teachers and students have also launched a grand study upsurge. Many schools have already set their own study weeks, specifically to study Chairman Mao's "On New Democracy." The joint unions of faculty, staff, and police from six universities, including Peking University, Tsinghua University, and Dongda University, and the "Beiping Primary School Committee for Welcoming the Liberation Army" have all held collective discussion sessions on "On New Democracy" separately. Participants spoke excitedly, and the atmosphere was extremely enthusiastic. The "On New Democracy" at the Beiping Xinhua Bookstore is in short supply.
