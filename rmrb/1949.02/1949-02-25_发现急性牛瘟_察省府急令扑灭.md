　　Acute Rinderpest Discovered
　　Chahar Provincial Government Issues Urgent Order for Eradication

　　[North China Dispatch, 22nd] Recently, acute rinderpest has occurred in Duolun, Baoyuan, Kangbao, Chongli, Pingbei (Beiping North), and Sihai counties in northern Chahar Province. The disease is spreading rapidly, and infected cattle die within three or four days, or even instantly. Currently, in Duolun (including two districts), Chongli, Baoyuan, and other places, more than 1,280 cattle have died, and in three districts of Sihai County, more than 50 cattle have died. In order to quickly and effectively eradicate rinderpest in the area, the Chahar Provincial Government has issued an urgent circular, deciding to implement the following emergency measures: (1) The Chabei and Jicha Special Districts must immediately organize a large number of cadres to go to the affected areas to widely mobilize the masses to implement isolation and disinfection, and organize local veterinarians to provide treatment. The provincial government will reward those who have new inventions for preventing rinderpest or who make effective secret formulas public, saving large numbers of sick cattle. (2) From now on, the Chabei and Jicha Special Districts are designated as "livestock danger zones," and it is forbidden to buy, sell, transport livestock, meat, or hides into or out of the area, or to transport livestock. (3) During periods of severe epidemic transmission, traffic may be temporarily suspended for emergency treatment. The circular states: Now that spring is approaching, epidemics are extremely likely to occur, especially at a time when spring plowing is underway and there is a shortage of animal power. All localities should pay serious attention to prevention so as not to cause losses to spring plowing.

　　[Zhangyuan Dispatch] In order to quickly eradicate the rinderpest that has occurred in Duolun, Baoyuan, Chongli, Sihai, and other counties, the Chahar Provincial People's Government, in addition to ordering local governments to quickly organize the people and veterinarians to carry out treatment, has also invited doctors from Beiping and cadres from the provincial government to organize two prevention and control teams, carrying medicines and equipment, to go to the epidemic areas on the 15th to cooperate in prevention and control work. At the same time, it ordered each special district, county, district, and village in the severely affected areas and near the affected areas to immediately establish veterinary prevention and control committees to concentrate their efforts on leading this work. Leading organs at all levels must regard the prevention and control of animal epidemics and the rescue of farm cattle as the most important task at present. In terms of work guidelines, prevention should be more important than treatment. Block traffic around the affected areas, strictly isolate them, dissolve cattle markets, and stop trafficking. In the "livestock danger zones," cattle are absolutely prohibited from entering or leaving before the ban is lifted.

　　发现急性牛瘟
  　察省府急令扑灭
    【华北二十二日电】察哈尔北部多伦、宝源、康保、崇礼及平（北平）北、四海等县，近发生急性牛瘟，蔓延甚烈，得病的牛三、四日内甚至立时毙命。现多伦（包括两个区）、崇礼、宝源等处，已死牛一千二百八十余头，四海县三个区已死牛五十余头。察哈尔省政府为迅速有效地扑灭该地区牛瘟，顷发出紧急通令，决定实行如下紧急措施：（一）察北、冀察两专区须立即组织大批干部分赴疫区，广泛动员群众实行隔离、消毒，并组织当地兽医治疗。对防止牛瘟有新发明或将特效密方公开而使大批病牛得救者，省政府给予奖励。（二）自即日起划定察北、冀察两专区为“牲畜危险区”，禁止向该区买卖贩运牲畜、畜肉、畜皮及携带牲畜运输。（三）疫病传染剧烈时期，得临时停止车马交通，突击治疗。通令称：现春季已临，瘟疫极易流行，特别是正值春耕和畜力缺乏的情况下，各地应严重注意防止，勿使春耕受到损失。
    【张垣电】为了迅速扑灭多伦、宝源、崇礼、四海等县所发生的牛瘟，察哈尔省人民政府除令当地政府迅速组织人民和兽医实行治疗外，并从北平延请医师和省府干部组织两个防治队，携带药品、器材，于十五日分赴疫区，协同进行防治工作。同时命令重疫区及近疫区之各专区、县、区、村，立即成立兽医防治委员会，集中精力领导这一工作。各级领导机关必须将防治兽疫抢救耕牛作为当前的头等重要工作。在工作方针上，应是防重于治。在疫区周围遮断交通，严行隔绝，解散牛市，停止贩运。在“牲畜危险区”，未解禁前绝对禁止牛只出入。
