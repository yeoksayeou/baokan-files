Xinhua News Agency, Central China, 19th -- Kuomintang bandit gang planes have continuously bombed towns and cities in the Central China Liberated Areas. On the 14th and 15th, bandit planes bombed Luohe City, in the southern section of the Pinghan Railway, twice, dropping a total of eight bombs, killing three peaceful residents, wounding eighteen, and destroying more than ten civilian houses. On the 13th, a bandit light bomber bombed Tanghe County, southeast of Nanyang, Henan, killing three civilians. Prior to this, a bandit plane harassed Kaifeng City on the 4th of this month, making two low-flying strafing runs in the South Gate area. All these bombings occurred at a time when the Kuomintang reactionaries were shouting about so-called "shortening the war" and "reducing the suffering of the people." In January, the towns and cities in Central China bombed by Kuomintang bandit planes included: Maping, west of Yingshan, Hubei Province; Xihe, east of Sui County; Shayang, south of Zhongxiang; and Suixikou, in northern Anhui Province.
