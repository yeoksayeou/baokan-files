Xinhua News Agency, Beiping, 19th: The Beiping Public Security Bureau cracked a major military espionage case on the 15th. The main culprit, Zhang Yinwu, the puppet Director of the North China Enemy-Rear Guerrilla Incitement Committee and Director of the North China People's Self-Salvation Association, was arrested by the Public Security Bureau at 9:00 PM on the 15th. Simultaneously arrested were Tong Shoushan, puppet Deputy Director of the North China Enemy-Rear Guerrilla Incitement Committee; Ma Xiyuan, puppet Commander of the 4th Corps of the North China Guerrilla Incitement Army; Zhang Jianhou, Commander of the 5th Corps; Li Guochang, Commander of the 6th Corps; Zhao Yiran, Commander of the 7th Corps; Jin Mingfu, Commander of the 9th Corps, and Zhao Zhenyu, Deputy Commander; and Huang Weiliang, puppet detachment leader of the North China Enemy-Rear Guerrilla Incitement Army, and others. Also seized were 229 rifles and pistols, 3 light machine guns, 2 carbines, 1 grenade launcher, 2 boxes of hand grenades, 4,650 rounds of ammunition, and 1 radio transmitter. The traitor Zhang was a notorious expert in opposing the people's democratic cause. In the early days of the Anti-Japanese War, he served as the Commander-in-Chief of the Kuomintang Hebei People's Army, colluding with the Japanese invaders, poisoning the people, and attacking the Eighth Route Army, committing all kinds of evil deeds. After the victory of the Anti-Japanese War, he served as the Commander of the Kuomintang Pinghan Northern Section Railway Protection Army and the head of the Hebei branch of the Three People's Principles Youth League, continuing his criminal activities against the people's democratic cause. Last year, he organized the so-called North China Enemy-Rear Guerrilla Incitement Committee and the North China People's Self-Salvation Association, using all his strength to continue to support the criminal counter-revolutionary war and forcing young students to engage in this criminal war. The Public Security Bureau seized a draft of a secret letter from the traitor Zhang to Fu Zuoyi, which stated: "Commander-in-Chief Yisheng, esteemed elder brother... The three schools (referring to Shejiao Teachers' School, Hebei Si Cun Middle School, and Beiping Si Cun Middle School) currently have more than 1,500 students, more than 200 various rifles, and 2 light machine guns. If they are organized and actively trained according to the wartime system, they can definitely cooperate with the army to directly participate in combat and indirectly undertake city defense work... Your younger brother, Zhang Yinwu." Shortly after this, the People's Liberation Army surrounded Pingjin. Seeing that things were not going well, the traitor Zhang wanted to change his tactics, using the method of "lurking and concealing, waiting for an opportunity to move" to carry out military sabotage plots. At 2:30 PM on January 2nd, the day after top war criminal Chiang Kai-shek issued his plea for peace, the traitor Zhang said at the Liaison Meeting of the puppet 29 Provincial and Municipal National Assembly Representatives: "Commander-in-Chief Fu and the Central Government are militarily powerless. Only peace can cover up the internationally-oriented anti-communist outposts in China and preserve strength. Peace is a bridge to the Third World War." In a manuscript written by the traitor Zhang entitled "Understanding of the Current Situation," he also said: "The control of armed forces is very necessary. But the use must be flexible, and the work must be confidential. Some can join the ranks of the enemy (referring to the People's Liberation Army), and some can be completely concealed... It is necessary to maintain long-term reserve forces to wait for changes in the international situation." After the liberation of Beiping, the traitor Zhang continued to use Si Cun Middle School as a cover, hiding a large number of weapons and frequently convening secret meetings, attempting to carry out military riots. However, these despicable tricks could not deceive the eyes of the people. Zhang Yinwu finally fell into the net of the people half a month after the liberation of Beiping.

Xinhua News Agency, Beiping, 19th: Xu Huidong, the executioner of the shocking July 5th Massacre in Beiping, was arrested by the Beiping Public Security Bureau on the 15th. After the liberation of Beiping, the families of the victims of the "July 5th" bloodbath and students from Northeast China studying in Beiping successively accused Xu of his crimes, demanding that the People's Government arrest him and bring him to justice. Fifteen schools and units from Northeast China in Beiping, including Northeast University, the Preparatory Class of Zhongzheng University, Changbai Normal College, and Liaohai Merchant Marine School, jointly established the "July 5th Bloodbath Accusation and Revenge Committee," demanding that the Military Control Commission arrest the perpetrator of the "July 5th" bloodbath. The vast number of students and citizens in Beiping responded to this call. On the 17th, the Beiping Municipal People's Government accepted this righteous demand and ordered the Public Security Bureau to arrest Xu. The traitor Xu was a major Kuomintang espionage chief, hated by the people of Beiping. After the Japanese surrender, he served as the "Director of the Kuomintang Beiping Municipal Party Headquarters," leading spies and persecuting the people. After the establishment of the puppet Beiping Municipal Council, Xu served as the puppet Speaker, falsely claiming to represent public opinion and supporting the counter-revolutionary war. Later, he instigated the puppet Beiping Municipal Council to pass a resolution forcing young students from Northeast China studying in Beiping to enlist in the army and serve as cannon fodder in the anti-people war. On July 5th, students from Northeast China studying in Beiping went to Xu's residence to petition, demanding the withdrawal of the resolution. The traitor Xu then directed Kuomintang bandit troops and police to massacre nine young students on the spot, injuring thirty-six students. The traitor Xu's series of crimes finally could not escape the just punishment of the people of Beiping.

　　北平破获国民党军事特务阴谋巨案
  　匪首张荫梧等均落法网
    国民党特务头子许逆惠东亦已逮捕
    【新华社北平十九日电】北平人民政府公安局于十五日破获一巨大军事特务案。主犯——伪华北敌后游击策动委员会主任委员兼伪华北民众自救会主任委员张荫梧，于十五日下午九时被人民政府公安局捕获。同时捕获者有伪华北敌后游击策动委员会副主任委员佟寿山，伪华北游击策动军第四总队司令马希援，第五总队司令张建侯，第六总队司令李国昌，第七总队司令赵毅然，第九总队司令金明甫、副总司令赵振宇，伪华北敌后游击策动军支队长黄渭良等人。并搜获长短枪二二九支，轻机枪三挺，卡宾枪二支，掷弹筒一个，手榴弹两箱，子弹四千六百五十发，电台一部。张逆为著名的反对人民民主事业的专家，在抗日战争初期任国民党河北民军总指挥，勾结日寇，荼毒人民，进攻八路军，无恶不作。抗日战争胜利后，曾任国民党平汉北段护路军司令、三民主义青年团河北支团长，继续其反对人民民主事业的罪恶活动。去年又组织所谓华北敌后游击策动委员会及华北民众自救会，用尽一切力量，继续撑持罪恶的反革命战争，并强迫青年学生去进行这种罪恶的战争。人民政府公安局搜获张逆致傅作义密函的草稿一纸，内称：“宜生总司令学长兄勋鉴……该三校（按指社教师范、河北四存中学、北平四存中学）现有学生一千五百余人，各种步枪二百余支，轻机枪两挺，若按战时体制予以编组，积极训练，决可配合军队直接参加作战，间接担任城防工作……弟张荫梧。”在此以后不久，人民解放军包围了平津，张逆看见事情不妙，又想改变一种形式，用“潜伏隐蔽、待机而动”的方法，施行军事破坏阴谋。在一月二日下午二时半，即头号战争罪犯蒋介石发表求和文告的第二天，张逆在伪二十九省市国大代表联谊会上说：“傅总司令及中央在军事上已无能为力。只有和，才能掩护在中国的带有国际性的反共的前哨战和能保存实力。和为过渡到第三次世界大战的桥梁。”在张逆写的一篇题为“目前形势的认识”的文稿中，也说：“武力的掌握是非常必要的。但运用必需灵活，工作必需机密。有的可以参加敌人（指解放军）的队伍，有的可完全隐蔽……必需长期的储备力量，以待国际局势的变化。”北平解放后，张逆仍以四存中学为掩护，暗藏大批武器，经常召集秘密会议，企图施行军事暴动。但是，这种卑劣的技俩，无论如何都瞒不过人民的眼睛。张逆荫梧在北平解放半月以后，终于落入人民的法网。
    【新华社北平十九日电】震动全国的北平七月五日大屠杀的刽子手许逆惠东，已于十五日为北平人民政府公安局逮捕。北平解放后，“七五”血案中牺牲者的家属及东北留平学生，即纷纷控诉许逆罪行，要求人民政府将其逮捕法办。东北大学、中正大学先修班、长白师范学院、辽海商船学校等东北在平十五个学校单位，联合成立了“七五血案控诉复仇委员会”，要求军管会逮捕“七五”血案罪魁。北平广大学生及市民闻声响应。十七日北平市人民政府接受这一正义要求，遂令公安局将许逆逮捕。许逆是国民党的大特务头子，北平市民恨之入骨。日本投降后，曾任国民党“北平市党部主任委员”，统率特务，迫害人民。伪北平市参议会成立后，许任伪议长，假借民意，支持反革命战争。后更主使伪北平市参议会通过强征东北来平青年学生入伍，充当反人民战争炮灰的议案。七月五日，东北来平学生齐赴许宅请愿，要求撤消该议案。许逆乃指使国民党匪帮军警，当场屠杀青年学生九人，负伤学生三十六人。许逆这一连串罪行，终于逃不脱北平人民的正义的惩处。
