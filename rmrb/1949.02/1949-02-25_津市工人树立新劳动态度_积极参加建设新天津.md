　　Tianjin Workers Establish New Labor Attitude
　　Actively Participate in the Construction of New Tianjin

[Tianjin Electric News] After a month of practical education and policy study since liberation, the workers in various state-owned factories and enterprises in Tianjin have begun to establish a sense of ownership and are engaging in the great work of building a new Tianjin with a new labor attitude. At the beginning of Tianjin's liberation, the workers were all jubilant, deeply aware that they had gotten rid of the oppression of imperialism, feudal forces, and bureaucratic capital and gained a new life of democracy and freedom. Therefore, they warmly welcomed the People's Liberation Army, celebrated their liberation, and actively resumed work and production. However, due to the Kuomintang reactionary government's years of bloody rule and deceptive propaganda, a few workers initially had some incorrect ideas. For example, some workers still had phenomena of absenteeism and missed work. On the issue of wages, some workers showed a tendency towards absolute egalitarianism, saying: "We are liberated, and everyone is equal. Why are the wages different?" Individual workers were unwilling to obey the leadership of production management personnel and refused to accept assigned work. In employee relations, because some staff members had helped the factory oppress workers in the past, some workers took a completely antagonistic attitude towards all staff members without distinction. Some workers made excessive economic demands. All these phenomena have been gradually corrected or are being corrected under the correct leadership of the Military Control Commission and the strengthening of policy education for workers.

After Tianjin's liberation, the Military Control Commission first convened a workers' symposium. Huang Kecheng, director of the Military Control Commission, and Huang Jing, deputy director, personally attended, explained the various policies of the Chinese Communist Party, and solicited workers' opinions on the government. This matter gave the workers of Tianjin a deep impression. Du Tianliang, a worker at the public bus factory, said: "After the Communist Party and the People's Liberation Army entered the city, they first looked for us workers, which really made us feel infinitely honored." The emergence of employee representative conferences and the fact that some factories absorbed worker representatives to participate in inventory work during the takeover process further enlightened the workers' political consciousness and began to establish a sense of ownership. Xie Quankui, the newly elected worker representative of the Tianjin Waterworks, said: "In the past, when the Kuomintang took over factories, we workers couldn't even participate in the inventory, and we had to stand far away when we saw those officials. Now, workers can participate in the inventory and management of factories. We are truly the masters of the factory." Dai Hong, a fitter at the machine factory, said: "Now the factory belongs to the people, and it also belongs to us workers. We must work hard to produce." The few workers who had the idea of absolute egalitarianism began to understand that employee treatment should be determined based on each person's labor and production capacity. Those with good skills who can produce more should receive more compensation. Only then is it fair; otherwise, no one will be willing to improve. At the same time, they correctly pointed out that the treatment of some employees formulated by the Kuomintang in the past was very unreasonable and should be adjusted. Workers also began to have a new understanding of production discipline. Worker Feng Xibing said: "In the past, the Kuomintang's reactionary discipline was set up to exploit us. Today, we are producing for ourselves, so we must abide by discipline and obey orders." Employee relations have also become more normal. Most workers already know the importance of employee unity. Regarding the fact that some staff members had embezzled wages and oppressed workers in the past, they demanded correct criticism to enable these staff members to correct their mistakes.

Due to the gradual elimination of various erroneous ideas, workers began to regard the factory as their own home. The workers of Yibei Electric Power Company did not even bother to go home after get off work every day. They wiped the machines clean and bright. When others asked them why they did not go back, they said: "In the past, we would not work in the factory, and we would go home as soon as we got off work. Now it is our home, and no one wants to leave." On the third of this month, the No. 3 turbine of the No. 3 power plant of the company suddenly experienced an abnormal phenomenon. Yu Wenchen, who was off work, immediately reported it and immediately inspected it. Sure enough, there was a problem. He said: "This is the property of the people and cannot be allowed to be damaged." In order to prevent reactionary elements from sabotaging factory equipment, the workers of Tianjin Electrical Repair Factory and other factories automatically organized pickets. After the workers understood the importance of inventorying materials in the takeover, they enthusiastically participated in this work. Zheng Guichen, a worker at Zhongfang No. 1 Factory, was hired by the employee working group to assist in the inventory. He arrived earlier than work every day and carefully reviewed the inventory. Under the active inspection of workers, the machine factory of the Enterprise Company discovered that many machines (such as an eight-horsepower internal combustion engine, automobile engine, grinding machine, etc.) and other materials were missing from the accounts, making it impossible for those who had managed them in the past to cheat. The workers' production enthusiasm is unprecedentedly high. In the past, it took at least four or five days for the municipal enterprise company to complete a furnace of silk boiling work (that is, putting iron bars or iron wires in the furnace to burn in order to remove rust and facilitate wire drawing), but now it is completed in two days, while in the past they would have gone to sleep and ignored it. The coal grabbing machine of the No. 1 Power Plant of Jibei broke a steel rope. All eleven workers in the shift worked together and repaired it in forty minutes, so that the coal supply to the boiler was not interrupted and the motor did not stop. If this had happened in the past, no one would have done it, and a few people in charge of repairs would have taken at least an hour and a half to repair it, and the power would have been interrupted for a while. The situation in Zhongfang factories and Dongya Cigarette Factory, where machines often stopped due to the inability of various departments to cooperate closely, has made obvious progress under the active improvement of workers. Sun Jinlin, a worker at the Electrical Repair Factory, automatically helped others repair the guard room on the day he was injured while carrying coal. He said: "If it were under the rule of the Kuomintang, he would have to rest for at least two months." The workers' enthusiasm is also reflected in their efforts to improve technology and save money. After research, the workers of the No. 1 Power Plant of Jibei Electric Power Company improved the method of repairing the oil switch of the stove air press, making it durable and easy to repair. When the workers of the Dong Station Locomotive Depot carried out the A-check (that is, major repair) of the "Tianjin Liberation" locomotive, they made full use of many waste materials, making the cost 70% lower than under the Kuomintang rule. The section then carried out the A-check of the "February 7th Memorial" locomotive, which took only four days, two days less than the A-check of the "Tianjin Liberation" locomotive, and the repair was more detailed.

### 津市工人树立新劳动态度　积极参加建设新天津

　　津市工人树立新劳动态度
  　积极参加建设新天津
    【天津电】经过解放后一个月来的实际教育和政策学习，天津市各公营工厂、企业中的工人们，已开始树立了主人翁的思想，以新的劳动态度，进行建设新天津的伟大工作。津市解放之初，工人们都欢欣鼓舞，深知从此摆脱了帝国主义、封建势力和官僚资本的压迫，获得了民主自由的新生活，因此热烈地欢迎人民解放军，庆祝自己的解放，积极复工生产。但是由于国民党反动政府多年来的血腥统治与欺骗宣传，开始时少数工人中间还存在着若干不正确的思想，例如有的工人，还有随意旷工、误工的现象。在工资问题上，有的工人表现了绝对平均主义的倾向，说：“解放了，一律平等了，工资为啥不一样？”个别工人不愿服从生产管理人员的领导，拒绝分配的工作。在职工关系上，由于某些职员过去帮助厂方压迫工人，有些工人对于一般职员就不加分别的都采取完全对立的态度，有些工人，提出过高的经济要求。所有这些现象，在军管会正确领导下，加强对工人们的政策教育，已逐渐的得到了纠正或正在纠正中。
    津市解放后，军管会首先召开了工人座谈会，军管会主任黄克诚、副主任黄敬均亲自出席，讲解中国共产党各种政策，征求工人们对于政府的意见。这件事给了天津的工人们一个很深的印象，公共汽车厂的工人杜天良说：“共产党人民解放军入城后，首先就找咱工人，真使我们感到无限的光荣。”职工代表会的产生和在接管工作中有些工厂吸收工人代表参加清点工作，更启发了工人们的政治觉悟，开始树立主人翁的思想。天津自来水厂新选出的工人代表谢全奎说：“过去国民党接收工厂，我们工人莫说参加清点，见了那些官老爷们也得站得远远的，现在呢，工人能够参加清点和管理工厂，我们这才真正当了工厂的主人。”机器厂的钳工戴鸿说：“现在工厂是人民的，也是我们工人自己的，我们要努力生产。”存在绝对平均主义思想的少数工人，开始明白职工待遇应根据各人的劳动和生产能力来决定，技术好能多生产，就应该多得报酬，这才算公平，不然，谁也不肯向上求进步了。同时正确的提出来过去国民党制订某些职工的待遇，很不合理，应作调整。工人对生产纪律也开始有了新的认识，工人冯习秉说：“过去国民党的反动纪律是为了剥削咱们来设的，今天咱是为着自己生产，来遵守纪律，服从指挥。”在职工关系上也比较正常了，一般工人都已知道职工团结的重要，对于某些职员过去贪污克扣工资，欺压工人的事实，则要求给以正确的批评。使这些职员改正自己的错误。
    由于种种错误思想的逐渐消除，工人们开始把工厂当做了自己的家。翼北电力公司的工人们，每天下班之后还不顾回家，他们把机器擦得光亮，当别人问他们为什么还不回去，他们说：“过去叫我们在厂里，我们也不干，一下班就回家了，现在是我们的家了，谁也不愿走。”该公司第三发电厂的第三号汽轮机在本月三日突然发生不正常的现象，下了班的于文琛马上就去报告，立刻检查，果然有了毛病，他说：“这是人民的财产，不能让它受到损害。”为了防止反动分子破坏工厂设备，天津电气修理厂等工厂的工人自动的组织了纠察队。工人们明白了清点资材在接管当中的重要意义之后，热烈的参加此项工作。中纺一厂的工人郑贵臣被职工工作组聘请协助清点，每天比上班来得还早，详细的审阅清册。企业公司的机器厂在工人积极检查之下，发现了许多机器（如八匹马力内燃机一座，汽车发动机、磨床等）和其他物资都漏在帐外，使过去经管的人想作弊也不可能了。工人们的生产热情空前高涨，市企业公司制订厂在过去至少需要四、五天才能完成一炉的煮丝工作（就是把铁条或铁丝放在炉中烧，为的是去铁锈和便于拉丝），现在两天就完成了，而过去他们早就睡觉不管了。冀北第一发电厂的抓煤机铁绳断了，全班十一个工人一齐动手，四十分钟就修好了，使锅炉的用煤没有中断，电机没有停，这事如果发生在过去，谁也不会动手，少数负责修理的人至少要一小时半才能修好，电就要中断一阵。中纺各厂和东亚烟厂中因为各部门不能紧密配合，而使机器常常停顿的情形，在工人积极改善下，已有明显进步。电气修理厂的工人孙金林在担煤受伤的那日，还自动的帮助别人修理警卫室，他说：“要在国民党统治时，至少也要歇他两个月。”工人的积极性同样也表现在他们设法改进技术与节约上面。冀北电力公司第一发电厂的工人经过研究，改良了修理火炉押风机油开关的办法使之耐久，并便于修理。东站机务段的工人，在甲检（就是大修理）“天津解放号”机车时，尽量利用了许多废料，使成本比国民党统治时节省了百分之七十，该段紧接着甲检的“二七纪念号”机车，只用了四天时间，比甲检“天津解放号”少用两天时间，而且检修得更细致。
