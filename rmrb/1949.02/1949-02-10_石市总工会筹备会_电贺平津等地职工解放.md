The Shijiazhuang City Federation of Trade Unions Preparatory Committee
　　Cables Congratulations on the Liberation of Workers in Beijing, Tianjin, and Other Places

[Our Newspaper's Dispatch] The Shijiazhuang City Federation of Trade Unions Preparatory Committee, in light of the recent liberation of workers in cities such as Beijing, Tianjin, and Baoding, has sent a telegram of congratulations, expressing hope for close unity, production support for the front, and striving for the complete liberation of the people of the whole country. The original telegram is as follows:

To the worker brothers of factories, railways, and mines in Beijing, Tianjin, Tangshan, Baoding, Zhangjiakou, Xuanhua, Changxindian, Mentougou, Shijingshan, Xiahuayuan, and other places:

We congratulate you on your complete liberation due to the rapid victory of the People's Liberation War!

Since the Kuomintang reactionaries launched the counter-revolutionary civil war, you have been resisting in various ways under reactionary rule. During the liberation wars in various cities, you hindered the enemy's conspiracy to dismantle factories and destroy materials and equipment, obstructed the enemy's military transportation and supply, and organized yourselves to defend the factories, effectively coordinating with the combat operations of the People's Liberation Army. After the battles, you quickly restored railway transportation and power, putting the blood-sucking institutions used by feudal bureaucratic capital and imperialism to oppress the people directly into the hands of our own workers to serve the people and carry out production to support the current Liberation War and help liberate the people still under the reactionary rule of the Kuomintang. The day of national victory is not far off. We hope that in the future we will unite more closely and, under the leadership of the working class's own political party—the Chinese Communist Party—and the people's leader, Comrade Mao Zedong, work harder to increase production to support the Liberation War, smash the hypocritical peace conspiracies of American imperialism and the Kuomintang reactionary traitorous government, and strive for the complete and eternal liberation of the people of the whole country!

Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, February 8th: Workers in the Shaanxi-Gansu-Ningxia Border Region and Chahar Province recently sent telegrams to workers in Beijing, Tianjin, Tangshan, and other cities, celebrating their liberation. The congratulatory telegram from the Shaanxi-Gansu-Ningxia Border Region Federation of Trade Unions stated: "Workers in factories in the Border Region were extremely excited to hear about the heroic actions of workers in the coal mines, power plants, and railways in Beijing and Tianjin to protect the mines and factories and quickly resume work." The congratulatory telegram also said: "You have already set the best example for other people through your own active actions. This is the supreme glory of our working class. Please forever maintain this valuable tradition and strive for the construction of a New China under the leadership of Chairman Mao." The congratulatory telegrams from the Chahar Provincial Federation of Trade Unions and the Zhangjiakou City Federation of Trade Unions Preparatory Committee stated: "Under the cruel exploitation and terrorist threats of the Kuomintang, you bravely persisted in the struggle and finally met our party—the Chinese Communist Party—and our army—the People's Liberation Army—with the victory of completely protecting the factory machinery. In addition to extending our heartfelt condolences and congratulations to you, we are willing to unite closely with you, strengthen our studies, and work hard to produce and build, contributing our greatest strength to fully realizing the eight peace conditions proposed by Chairman Mao and liberating the working class and all working people throughout the country." The congratulatory telegram from the Jinan City Federation of Trade Unions Preparatory Committee stated: "On this victorious New Year, we congratulate you on your liberation. In addition to actively producing to support the war, the workers in this city are also diligently engaging in various political, technical, and cultural studies, and have initially established their own organizations. In the future, we are willing to unite more closely to fight for the complete overthrow of the reactionary rule of the Kuomintang and the aggressive forces of American imperialism in China." Furthermore, the Jinan City Democratic Women's Federation, the City Youth Federation Preparatory Committee, and the City Student Federation also sent telegrams to women and male and female students from all walks of life in Beijing, Tianjin, Tangshan, and other cities, warmly congratulating them on their liberation.

    北平、天津、唐山、保定、张家口、宣化、长辛店、门头沟、石景山、下花园等地各工厂、铁路、矿山的职工兄弟们：
    我们向你们庆贺，由于人民解放战争迅速的胜利，你们获得了完全解放！
    在国民党反动派发动反革命的内战以来，你们在反动统治下用各种方式来进行反抗斗争。在各城市解放战争中，你们阻碍了敌人拆搬工厂、破坏物资器材的阴谋，阻碍了敌人的军事运输和供给，有组织的起来守卫工厂，有力的配合了解放军的战斗行动。战斗结束后，你们又迅速恢复了铁路交通，恢复了动力，使过去封建官僚资本与帝国主义用来压榨人民的吸血机构，马上掌握在我们工人自己手里，来为人民服务，进行生产，以支援当前的解放战争，帮助解放仍在国民党反动统治下的人民。全国的胜利的日子已为期不远了，希望我们今后更密切团结在一起，在工人阶级自己的政党——中国共产党和人民领袖毛泽东同志领导下，更努力来提高生产，以支援解放战争，粉碎美帝国主义与国民党反动卖国政府的虚伪和平阴谋，争取全国人民完全的永远的解放！
    【新华社陕北八日电】陕甘宁边区及察哈尔省等地工人最近驰电北平、天津、唐山等城市工人，庆祝他们获得解放。陕甘宁边区总工会的贺电中说：“边区各工厂工人听到了平津煤矿、电力、铁路各业工人保护矿厂迅速复工的英勇行动，极为兴奋。”贺电中又说：“你们已经以自己的积极行动给其他人民做了最好的榜样，这是我们工人阶级的无上光荣。请你们永远保持着这种可贵的传统，在毛主席的领导下，为新中国的建设而奋斗。”察哈尔省总工会、张家口市总工会筹委会的贺电说：“你们在国民党残酷的剥削和恐怖威胁下，英勇地坚持斗争，终于先后以完整地保护了工厂机器的胜利，和我们的党——中国共产党、我们的军队——人民解放军见面了。我们除向你们致以亲切的慰问与庆贺外，并愿与你们紧密团结，加强学习，努力生产建设，为全部实现毛主席所提的八项和平条件、解放全国的工人阶级和一切劳动人民而贡献我们最大的力量。”济南市职工总会筹委会的贺电中说：“际此胜利新春，祝贺你们获得解放。本市职工除积极生产支援战争外，还努力进行着政治、技术、文化的各种学习，并初步建立了自己的组织。今后愿我们更紧密的团结起来，为彻底推翻国民党反动统治及美国帝国主义侵略势力出中国而奋斗。”又济南市民主妇联及市青联筹委会、市学联亦分别致电北平、天津、唐山等市各界妇女及男女学生，热烈祝贺她（他）们获得解放。
