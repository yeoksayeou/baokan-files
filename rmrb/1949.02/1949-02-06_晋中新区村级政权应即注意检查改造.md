Editor's Note: Unfair war service burdens and many malpractices have occurred in various places in Jinzhong. Various places have begun to pay attention to improvement and liquidate war service accounts, which is very necessary. However, this alone is not enough, because the key to the problem lies in the fact that the old regime may not have been thoroughly transformed. Therefore, in future work, we must strengthen the education of village government personnel and pay attention to promoting new backbones to gradually transform the village regime.

[Jinzhong Electric] In counties such as Xugou, Fenyang, and Wenshui, because most village governments in the newly liberated areas have not been transformed, unfair war service burdens have caused serious phenomena such as the escape of civilian laborers and the selling of livestock. In Jiabao, Xugou, which has more than sixty households, the old village cadres only reported twenty-five households. In Dachang Town, there are thirty-six head of livestock, but only twenty-five were reported. The old village cadres not only sheltered their own villages but also their relatives. A Li head in Fenyang Chengguan, on the one hand, signed up for his relatives in front of our cadres to please them; but when he was about to leave, he secretly informed his relatives to escape, and another person was caught to make up the number. In Xicheng Village, Wenshui, there are one hundred and sixteen young and strong men who do not support the front. There are also thirty-one in Zhangbei Village, Fenyang, and they force outsiders to go. According to statistics in Zhongzhuang Village, Wenshui County, within eighty days, due to unfair service, the entire village sold seven out of ten donkeys in one day. Similar phenomena also occurred in Fenyang and Xiaoyi. In Nanwu Town, Fourth District of Wenshui, three families with vehicles and horses formed a vehicle and horse association. When livestock were sent out on missions, they were priced and sold to the village. The people in the vehicle and horse association got money and did not serve in the war effort, and temporarily designated middle and poor peasants to go, without solving their family difficulties. The people driving the livestock did not cherish them because they were not their own, and six died. In Nanzhangjia Village, Sixth District, the method of apportionment was used to buy two donkeys and two mules to support the front. In Fenyang Chengguan, some deliberately bought bad donkeys to support the front. After the livestock died, they could still profit from the compensation. After discovering the above unfair phenomena, various places began to thoroughly implement the policy of service and have achieved some practical results. After Guo Jia Zhuang, Third District of Fenyang, cleared the work points, they were given 400 catties of millet, and the masses automatically requested to support the front. The whole village originally had thirty-eight donkeys, and twenty-nine were added. Originally, there were five cattle, and seven were added. Originally, there were three mules, and one was added. After Wang Shengzhou cleared his work points, the superiors wanted seven people, and nine people in the village were competing to go. In Wujiazhai, First District, after nine escaped civilian laborers learned about the work point situation in their village, eight of them automatically returned to the team.

　　晋中新区村级政权应即注意检查改造
    编者按：晋中各地战勤负担不公，发生许多弊病，各地已开始注意改进，清算勤务帐目，这是很需要的。但仅仅这样作还不够，因为问题的关键在于旧的政权恐还没作过彻底改造，故必须在今后工作中，加强对村政人员的教育，并注意提拔新的骨干，逐步的将村政权加以改造。
    【晋中电】徐沟、汾阳、文水等县，由于新解放区大部村政权没有改造，战勤负担不公，造成民工逃亡、卖牲口等严重现象。徐沟六十余户的贾堡，旧村干部只报二十五户。大常镇有三十六头牲口，只报二十五头。旧村干部，不只包庇本村，同时也包庇亲戚。汾阳城关一闾长，一面在我方干部面前，代自己亲戚报名讨好；而当临走时，却暗里告知亲戚逃跑，抓去另一群众顶数。文水西城村，有一百一十六个不支前的青壮年。汾阳张北村也有三十一个，他们强迫外来户去。文水县中庄村八十天内的统计，因服勤不公，全村共有十头毛驴，一天便卖掉七头。汾阳、孝义也发生同类现象。文水四区南武镇，三家有车马的，组成车马会，牲口出差，便作价算作卖给村中。车马会的人又得到钱，又不服战勤，临时指定中贫农去，不给解决家庭困难，赶牲口的人认为不是自己的，不爱惜牲口，死了六头。六区南张家庄，用摊派办法，买下两个毛驴、两个骡子去支前。汾阳城关，有的故意买上坏毛驴去支前，牲口死了，赔偿后还可从中渔利。发现了以上不公现象后，各地开始深入贯彻服勤政策，并已收得一些实际效果。汾阳三区郭家庄算清工后，给贴了四百斤小米，群众即自动要求支前。全村原有毛驴三十八头，新增二十九头。原来有牛五头，新增七头。原骡子三头，新增一头。王盛周算清勤工后，上面要七个人，村里有九个人争着要去。一区武家寨，九个逃回的民工，得知本村算工情况后，即有八个自动归队。
