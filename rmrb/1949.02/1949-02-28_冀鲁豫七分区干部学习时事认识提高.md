Learning Dynamics

   The Propaganda Department of the Seventh Sub-district of the Hebei-Shandong-Henan Border Region, focusing on "Carrying the Revolution Through to the End" and Chairman Mao's statement on the current situation, arranged for all cadres in the district to study current events. The study methods included inspirational reports, group discussions, and self-criticism linked to one's own experiences. The results of the study were very effective: First, before the study, some cadres had an insufficient understanding of the reactionary US-Chiang clique. After the study, this incorrect view was completely eliminated, and it was recognized that the revolution must be carried through to the end and that the people's power can overcome everything. Second, some cadres had a sense of complacency, believing that after defeating Chiang Kai-shek, they could go home and enjoy themselves; some comrades felt that they were country bumpkins and that it would be difficult to work in large cities. These ideas were criticized and overcome in the study: Although the Kuomintang reactionaries are about to be defeated, imperialism still exists; moreover, the construction of a New Democratic country requires our active efforts to complete victoriously. After this study, many cadres were particularly enthusiastic about their work, and those who originally wanted to go home for the Lunar New Year did not go.

　　冀鲁豫七分区干部学习时事认识提高
    冀鲁豫七分区宣传部，以“将革命进行到底”和毛主席对时局声明为主，向全区干部布置了时事学习。学习方法有启发报告，分组讨论，和联系自己展开批评与自我批评。学习结果，收效很大：一、未学习前，部分干部对美蒋反动派的认识不足。学习后，已全部清洗了这种不正确的看法，认识了必须将革命进行到底，人民力量可以战胜一切。二、部分干部有太平观念，认为打完蒋介石，就可以回家享福了；部分同志则觉得自己是土包子，打开大城市工作不好搞。在学习中都一一批判和克服了这种思想：国民党反动派虽然快被打垮，但帝国主义还存在；而且新民主主义国家的建设，还需要我们积极努力，才能胜利的完成。好多干部经过这次学习，工作热情特别高涨，过去旧历年要回家的，也不回了。
