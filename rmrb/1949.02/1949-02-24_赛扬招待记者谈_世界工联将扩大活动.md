　　Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 22nd: TASS, Prague: Louis Saillant, General Secretary of the World Federation of Trade Unions (WFTU), held a press conference on the 18th before his departure, explaining the situation of the WFTU and the prospects for its future activities. He said: The WFTU Executive Committee, representing the will of the working people, most resolutely condemns the sabotage activities of the British and American right-wing trade union leaders. The continued existence of the WFTU shows that this organization enjoys the support of the vast majority of working people around the world. When the WFTU was first established in 1945, it had only 65 million members, while on January 1, 1949, it already had 76 million members. Sérantine said: The WFTU will establish industry-specific trade departments before the Representative Assembly to be held in Milan in June. Sérantine concluded by saying: The WFTU will continue to fight with greater strength for the cause of peace, for the unity of the working class and working people of all countries.
