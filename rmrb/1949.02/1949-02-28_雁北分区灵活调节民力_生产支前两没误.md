Xinhua News Agency, Xingxian, 26th: In the Yanbei Sub-district outside Yanmen Pass in Jin-Sui District, the flexible adjustment of civilian labor and multifaceted consideration of production, during last year's support for the front lines in Suiyuan, meant that although more than one million individual workdays and 350,000 animal workdays were mobilized, production was not affected, and some civilian laborers even gained certain benefits during their support for the front. The Suiyuan battles occurred during the autumn harvest season, but the autumn harvest in the mountainous areas of Pinglu, Youyu, and other counties was half a month earlier than in the plains areas of Shuoxian, Shanyin, and other counties. Therefore, when mobilizing the people to support the front, the leading organs of the sub-district allowed farmers from regions with later harvests to undertake tasks before the start of the battle, so that they could still return home to harvest after completing their tasks; farmers from regions with earlier harvests were assigned tasks after the start of the battle, so that their harvest would be completed by the time they departed. As a result, neither was production delayed. At the same time, based on the distance from the front lines, farmers from more distant regions were mobilized first, leaving civilian labor from Zuoyun, Youyu, and other counties closer to the front to be used later. This allowed farmers in the frontline counties to focus on production, and also maintained them as a mobile force that could be deployed at any time, which was very beneficial for balancing the burdens of each county. The leading organs of the sub-district also paid attention to organizing civilian laborers to transport goods back on their return trips after supporting the front. More than 300 carts from the sub-district that transported coal were able to buy grain that was lacking in the Yanbei area on their return trip, netting an estimated 250 jin of rice per cart per trip. Farmers in Zuoyun and Youyu counties also bought back 1,600 head of livestock from Suiyuan while supporting the front. Regarding the forage for military horses at the front, the sub-district used the method of mobilizing farmers to cut wild grass to solve the problem. This not only saved the farmers' livestock feed but also resulted in a surplus because more was cut than needed for military use. Farmers also incidentally harvested a large amount of grass seeds for drought prevention and famine preparedness; farmers in Pinglu County alone harvested more than 200,000 jin of grass seeds.

　　雁北分区灵活调节民力
  　生产支前两没误
    【新华社兴县二十六日电】晋绥雁门关以外的雁北分区在去年支援绥远前线的工作中，灵活调节民力，多方照顾生产，虽先后动员了一百多万个人工与三十五万个畜工，而生产并未受到影响，部分民工且在支前中得到若干利益。绥远战事正值秋收季节，但平鲁、右玉等县山地地区的秋收比朔县、山阴等县平川地区要早半个月，因此该分区领导机关在动员人民支援前线时，让收割较迟地区的农民去担任战役开始前的差务，以便他们在任务完毕后仍能赶回家秋收；让收割较早地区的农民，担任战役开始后的差务，当出发时，他们的收割已完毕了。结果都没有耽误生产。同时根据距离前线的远近，先动员较远地区的农民，把左云、右玉等靠近前线地区的民力留后使用，这样就使前沿县份农民安心生产，且保持作为机动力量，可以随时调遣，对平衡各县负担很有好处。分区的领导机关又注意了组织民工进行支前回程的运输。该分区三百多辆运炭去的大车，回程买来雁北地区所缺少的粮食，计每辆车一次可净赚米二百五十斤。左云、右玉两县农民还在支前中从绥远买回牲口一千六百头。对于前方军用的马草，该分区用发动农民割野草的方法来解决。这样不仅节省了农民的畜草，而且因为割得多，除了供给军用还有盈余。农民又附带收获了大量防旱备荒用的草籽，仅平鲁一县的农民就收了草籽二十多万斤。
