　　A Son in Chiang Kai-shek's Army, Another in the People's Liberation Army
  　Should Such Families Receive Preferential Treatment?
    To the Editors:
    We have three difficulties in our preferential treatment work for military families in Hou'ao Village, Fifth District, Qinghe: First, the Xu family has two sons. The elder son joined Chiang Kai-shek's army, while the younger son is a soldier in the People's Liberation Army. There are two people in the family, including the elder son's wife. They cultivate 17 mu of land but lack labor and livestock. Second, one military family has labor but they have gone out to do business. They have quite a bit of land but no livestock. Third, another military family has an 18-year-old youth who is too small, practically lacking labor. How should the village take care of these issues? Please answer!
    　　　　　From Meng Xianhuan, Xu Yintang, Ren Changwei, and Ren Junkui of Hou'ao Village, Fifth District, Qinghe County.
    Comrades Ren Changwei, Ren Junkui, Xu Yintang, and Meng Xianhuan:
    Here are our answers to the three military families in your village:
    Xu's family has two sons. The elder son is in Chiang Kai-shek's army, which is not honorable because it is anti-people and oppresses the people. The village should properly persuade and mobilize his family to find ways to make his elder son leave Chiang Kai-shek's army as soon as possible and stop being cannon fodder for the reactionaries. His younger son's participation in the Liberation Army is honorable, and the family should enjoy the preferential treatment given to military families. However, how should his family enjoy land cultivation assistance? They should only receive assistance for the amount of land corresponding to his younger son's share. If the family can maintain their livelihood without land cultivation assistance, they should not receive it.
    If a military family has labor but they have gone out to do business, their income from the business should be combined with their other family income to see if they can maintain their livelihood. If they can, they should not receive land cultivation assistance. If they definitely have difficulty maintaining their livelihood, it must be discussed by the village meeting to assist with cultivating the land share of the soldier.
    If a military family has an 18-year-old youth whose physique is not yet sound, they can be considered as half labor according to the actual situation. If they have difficulty maintaining their livelihood, it must be resolved through discussion at the village meeting.
    In conclusion, the principle is to reduce the burden on the masses, organize military families to be self-sufficient through production as much as possible, and enable military families to maintain their livelihoods.

专栏：询问与答复

　　大儿在蒋匪军二儿在解放军
  　这样的家属应否优待？编辑同志：
    清河五区后鳌村优军工作有三种困难：一、许门许氏他有两个儿子，大儿子参加蒋匪军，二儿子在人民解放军里当战士，他家里有两口人，有他大儿的老婆，在家里种着十七亩地，没有劳力，也没有牲口。二、有一家军属他家里有劳力，但出去做买卖去了，他的地还不少，也没有牲口。三、还有一家军属，他家里有个青年十八岁，他的个子太小，等于没有劳力。以上这些问题村里应如何照顾？请答！
    　　　　　清河县五区后鳌村（孟宪换、许印堂、任常维、任俊魁）任常维、任俊魁、许印堂、孟宪换四同志：
    对你村这三户军属分别解答如下：
    许门许氏他有两个儿子，大儿子在蒋匪军里，这是不光荣的，因它是反人民的，压迫人民的部队，村里应该好好的说服及动员他的家属，想各种办法，使他的大儿子赶快脱离蒋匪军，不要再给反动派当炮灰啦；他的二儿子参加解放军，这是光荣的，应该享受对军人家属的优待。但他家是如何享受代耕呢？那就只能对他二儿子所应分得的土地数给予代耕。如不享代耕家庭亦可维持生活者，不得享受代耕。
    军属家里有劳力而出外做买卖者，就应按他在外做买卖的收入和他家庭一切收入合计起来，看是不是能够维持生活，如能够的话，不得享受代耕。如生活确定难维持者，须经村民大会讨论，代耕其军人应得之土地数。
    军属家里有十八岁的青年，而体格尚未健全者，可按实际情况减低为半劳力，如生活难维持者，须经村民大会讨论解决之。
    总之：以减少群众负担，尽量组织军属生产自给，使军属能维持生活为原则。
