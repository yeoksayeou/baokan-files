　　"Dear Uncles, I Salute You!"
    [Our Newspaper] In the rear, the labor-army support movement in various organs and schools also involves elementary school students. The Rongzhen School in the military region is busy with the winter vacation exams, and teachers and older students are rushing to make comfort bags at night. Students who don't know how ask for help from the staff and faculty. Those who can write letters have written letters. A certain student in the second grade wrote: "Dear Uncle: How is your health? Where are you now? If it weren't for your victories in the front, we in the rear would not be able to study in peace. How many cities have you captured, do you remember? Do you know my dad? I salute you, Uncle, and hope you will capture Beiping soon, because I haven't been there and would like to see it." The labor-army support in Yucai Elementary School is also in full swing. Sixth-grade students are taking graduation exams and don't have a moment to spare. They asked the school to issue more oil so they could work late into the night making comfort bags. A student named Liu Zhi wrote the following passage in his letter of appreciation: "Dear Northeast and North China People's Liberation Army: I rushed to make a comfort bag at night. Tomorrow, I will use the money I saved from cutting grass to buy a box of cigarettes, and pack a bar of soap and a towel that I won as a model, even though these things are few, my heart is big!" Some students asked the People's Liberation Army to "capture all forty-three principal war criminals mentioned by Chairman Mao, and not let a single one escape." The comfort bags are mostly filled with "Warrior Brand" cigarettes. One student packed a tobacco pouch, and specially bought a pipe to include. Some people also wrote a clapper rhyme: "The cigarette is sweet, the cigarette is fragrant, smoking the cigarette makes your legs longer, legs longer, capture Beiping and cross the Yangtze River." In just two short days, they made more than two hundred comfort bags, and almost every bag contained a letter. (Zhao Junde, Zhang Yindou)

　　“亲爱的叔叔们，我给你们敬礼！”
    【本报讯】后方各机关学校的劳军运动中，小学生也在忙碌着。军区荣臻学校正忙着寒假考试，教职员和大一些的学生都在夜间赶制慰问袋。不会做的学生请教、职员帮忙，会写信的都写了信。二年级某同学写着：“亲爱的叔叔：你的身体好吧？你现在在哪里？要不是你们在前方打胜仗，我们在后方就不能安心学习。你们打下了多少城市，还记得吗？你认识我的爸爸吗？我最后给叔叔敬礼，希望你早日打下北平，因我没去过，很想去看一看。”育才小学的劳军也闹得热火朝天，六年级学生正进行毕业考试，没一点时间，他们要求学校多发点油，赶夜工做慰问袋。一位叫刘致的同学的慰劳信里有这样一段话：“亲爱的东北、华北人民解放军：我黑夜紧赶着做了一个慰问袋，天明我把我割草省下的钱买了一盒纸烟，把我当模范得奖的一条肥皂、一条手巾给你们装上，这点东西虽少，心可大呵！”有的同学要求人民解放军“把毛主席说的那四十三名头等战犯都捉住，一个也不叫他逃走”。他们慰问袋里大都装的“勇士牌”香烟。一个同学装了一荷包烟叶，特别买了个烟锅装上。有的人还写了快板道：“烟儿甜、烟儿香，吸了烟儿腿儿长，腿儿长，打下北平过长江。”他们在短短两天中，做了二百多个慰问袋，差不多每个袋子里都装了一封信。　　　（赵竣德、张印斗）
