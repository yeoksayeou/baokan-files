New Agricultural Tax Clapper Talk
(Contribution No. 2)
Yang Zhongming

I.

　　Hey folks, listen to what I say,
　　There’s something important to discuss today,
　　Our district's new agricultural tax,
　　The government has announced the facts,
　　If you don't know the content,
　　Listen carefully as I explain.
　　Land reform divided things fairly,
　　We peasants have stood up freely.
　　With land and tools in our hand,
　　We should labor hard throughout the land,
　　Reward hard work and more production,
　　A new tax burden is the solution.
　　The People's Army is on the move,
　　National victory is soon to prove,
　　Resolutely eliminate Chiang Kai-shek,
　　For freedom and equality, no turning back.
　　Although victory isn't far away,
　　The enemy won't just fade away,
　　The revolution must be fought to the end,
　　We must strive to support the front, my friend.
　　The government announces the agricultural tax,
　　Considering both public and private interests, no relaxing,
　　Guaranteeing the war's supply,
　　Developing agricultural production sky-high,
　　Protecting the fruits of labor's toil,
　　A fixed and reasonable burden for the soil.
　　Whoever owns land pays the tax,
　　Each person gets a tax-free break.
　　Some land is exempt from the levy,
　　Listen as I tell you briefly:
　　Roads, canals, and riverbeds,
　　Farmers' fields and courtyards, instead,
　　Dikes, wasteland, and timberland,
　　Generally, no burden is planned,
　　But if you're lazy and let the land go to waste,
　　That doesn't fall within this grace.
　　Reclaiming new wasteland or newly cultivated land,
　t be taxed for three years, understand.
　　Fallow land for six full years,
　　Is seen as wasteland, drying up tears.
　　Three or five years of fallow ground,
　　Is still a good bet all around,
　　From the time you cultivate it again,
　　No tax for two years, again and again.
　　Mountain land, newly built riverbanks,
　　Hard to produce if water overtakes,
　　From the year you get your yield,
　　The burden is waived for three years concealed,
　　If you share the land to plant and sow,
　　Whoever farms it, the tax they owe.
　　The overall principle of the agricultural tax,
　　Is to reward labor and production relax.

II.

　　The agricultural tax is quite thorough,
　　The calculation method, easy to follow,
　　First, establish a "standard mu,"
　　Calculated according to output, to view,
　　Normal output of one shi per year,
　　Is calculated as one "standard" mu, it's clear.
　　Future agricultural burden,
　　Is based on normal output, discern,
　　Deep plowing, careful cultivation, more fertilizer apply,
　　Select good seeds and increase the output high,
　　No matter how much production may grow,
　　The extra harvest will not be taxed, you know.
　　No matter what crops you plant,
　　Be it oilseed or cotton, extant,
　　Though the profit may be grand,
　　It's taxed as if you planted grain in the land.
　　If someone wants to be lazy and avoid work,
　　If someone wants to sit and be a shirk,
　　Though the land produces less grain, you see,
　　The burden will not be reduced, disagree?
　　If you want to dig a channel or sink a well,
　　To turn dry land into a wetland spell,
　　The burden won't increase for three years, hold,
　　It's still calculated as dry land, we're told.
　　Repairing abandoned channels or wells that broke,
　　Restoring the original wetland spoke,
　　No tax increase for two years around,
　　The burden increases from the third year onward, bound.
　　Mulberry orchards, bamboo gardens, fruit tree arrays,
　　Mountain goods, lotus ponds, product displays,
　　Based on the average wholesale price,
　　Halve it and calculate it in grain, so concise.
　　The calculation method is explained in detail,
　　The folks must remember it without fail,
　　Everyone work hard together with might,
　　Become wealthy and increase production with all our light.

III.

　　All agricultural personnel here,
　　Regardless of old or young, female or male, clear,
　　Each person gets a "standard mu,"
　　Exempt from tax, absolutely true,
　　For the sake of easy speech to make it clear,
　　It's called a tax-free tier.
　　Each person can only deduct one,
　　There are no loopholes to outrun.
　　Widows, widowers, orphans, and the lonely,
　　Military families and martyrs, they are worthy,
　　To take care of their lives,
　　We can increase the tax-free drives.
　　Glorious martyrs who sacrificed their lives,
　　Revolutionary soldiers and staff members, thrives,
　　Must deduct their tax-free portion,
　t that distortion;
　　If she is a female comrade,
　　And has already married, it's bestowed,
　　Whose family deducts it, the in-laws or her own?
　　It all depends on her own will shown,
　　Without the organization's proof,
　　The in-laws deduct the tax-free roof.
　　People who are cared for in rotation,
　　Which family deducts the tax-free donation?
　　This cannot be rigidly decreed,
　　Those in rotation must agree.
　　People who live in others' homes year-round,
　　With no other property found,
　　The family that raises them,
　　Deducts the tax-free gem.
　　If there are long-term workers employed,
　　Seeing whose family it is enjoyed,
　　Deduct them separately to be deployed.
　　If they are short-term temporary hands,
　　You can't deduct tax-free demands.
　　People who are away all year,
　　Whose lives are not managed by the family near;
　　If they are engaged in industry and commerce,
　t deduct any tax-free source.
　　Whoever raises livestock for plowing the land,
　　Whoever raises young livestock for production planned,
　　Give them all a deduction for consumption,
　　Raising livestock is a great assumption,
　　How is its consumption deducted?
　　Also calculated according to "standard mu" conducted,
　　Cattle and donkeys deduct four dou in time,
　　Mules and horses deduct seven dou in rhyme.

IV.

　　How is the burden ultimately paid?
　　Listen slowly as I cascade:
　　All the family's standard mu,
　　Deduct consumption, tax-free, true,
　　How many standard mu are left in the queue,
　　Calculate them according to "burden mu," it's new.
　　If the output assessment is real,
　　Then the burden can be fixed, we feel.
　　The unit for calculating the burden,
　　Millet is the standard, no stubborn,
　　Each year, one "burden mu,"
　　Pays twenty-five jin as due.
　　All local grain funds,
　t be arbitrarily spun.
　　At most five jin per mu shown,
　　Adminstrative offices manage alone,
　　The whole year's agricultural tax levied,
　　In summer and autumn it's received,
　　If there is no summer harvest region,
　　The whole amount is collected in autumn's legion.
　　Convenient for the people to pay,
　　Guarantee the supply without dismay,
　　Besides paying grain and cloth array,
　　You can also pay with straw and cash today,
　　If you encounter flood, drought, pests, or hail's blast,
　　Paying public grain is difficult, not surpassed,
　　The government, according to the real situation,
　　Can postpone or reduce the tax's duration.

　　新农业税快板
    （应征稿之二）
    杨忠铭
    一
　
    叫老乡，听我言，
     有件大事谈一谈，
     咱区新的农业税，
     政府公布在报端，
     内容你要不知道，
     听我仔细谈一遍。
     土地改革大平分，
     咱们农民把身翻。
     有了土地和农具，
     就应劳动多生产，
     奖励劳动多生产，
     就得实行新负担。
     人民军队大进攻，
     全国胜利并不远，
     坚决消灭蒋介石，
     自由平等万万年。
     虽然胜利不很远，
     敌人自己不会完，
     革命必须打到底，
     还得努力支前线。
     政府公布农业税，
     公私兼顾很周全。
     保证战争的供给，
     发展农业大生产，
     保障劳动的所得，
     固定合理的负担。
     谁有土地谁纳税，
     每人除个免税点。
     有些土地不纳税，
     听我把它说一遍：
     公路、水渠及河身，
     农民场地和房院，
     河堤、荒地、林木地、
     一般都不出负担，
     如因偷懒把地荒，
     那可不能在此限。
     开垦生荒新修地，
     免征三年才负担。
     熟荒已满六年整，
     当作生荒一样看。
     三年五年的熟荒，
     谁再去种也合算，
     自你再种来开始，
     两年以内不负担。
     山地、新修河滩地，
     防被水冲难生产，
     自有收获那年起，
     负担免去头三年，
     谁和别人轮种地，
     轮到谁种谁负担。
     农业税则总方针，
     奖励劳动多生产。
　
     二
　
     农业税则很周全，
     计算办法也简单，
     首先定出“标准亩”，
     按照产量来计算，
     常年产量一市石，
     就按“标准”一亩算。
     今后农业的负担，
     根据常年产量算；
     深耕细作多施肥，
     选用良种多生产，
     不管生产怎样多，
     多收获的不负担。
     不管你种甚植物，
     是种油料或种棉，
     虽然种这利润大，
     也按种谷去负担。
     谁想偷懒不劳动，
     谁想坐着当懒汉，
     虽然土地少打粮，
     负担一点不少算。
     你要开渠或凿井，
     想变旱田为水田，
     负担三年不增加，
     仍按旱田来计算。
     修理废渠或废井，
     恢复原来的水田，
     二年以内不加税，
     三年开始多负担。
     桑园、竹园、果木园、
     山货藕池的出产，
     按着批发平均价，
     对半折谷来计算。
     计算办法讲一遍，
     老乡都要记心间，
     大家加油齐努力，
     发家致富多生产。
　
     三
　
     所有农业的人员，
     不分老少女和男，
     每人除个“标准亩”，
     免去纳税不负担，
     为着说起来方便，
     叫做一个免税点。
     每人只能除一个，
     这里没有空子钻。
     鳏寡孤独无劳力，
     军工烈属有困难，
     照顾他们的生活，
     才可增加免税点。
     光荣牺牲的烈士、
     革命军人和职员，
     要在本人的家中，
     扣除他的免税点；
     如果她是女同志，
     已经结婚怎么办？
     婆家娘家谁家扣？
     全依本人的自愿，
     没有机关的证明，
     婆家扣除免税点。
     被人轮流养活的人，
     谁家扣除免税点？
     这个不能死规定，
     轮养人们去商谈。
     常年寄居别人家，
     自己另外无财产，
     谁家把他来抚养，
     谁家扣除免税点。
     家里雇的有长工，
     看在谁家来吃饭，
     分别扣除来计算。
     如是零碎雇短工，
     不能扣除免税点。
     常年在外的人员，
     生活不由家庭管；
     本人经营工商业，
     不再扣除免税点。
     谁养牲口为种地，
     谁养幼畜为生产，
     一律给他除消耗，
     喂养牲口有光沾，
     它的消耗怎样扣？
     也按“标准亩”计算，
     牛驴扣除四斗整，
     骡马扣除谷七斗。
　
　　 四
　
     负担到底怎样纳？
     慢慢听我谈一谈：
     全家所有标准亩，
     扣除消耗免税点，
     剩下多少标准亩，
     就按“负担亩”计算。
     如果产量评真实，
     就能固定派负担。
     计算负担的单位，
     小米为准很方便。
     每年一个“负担亩”，
     二十五斤纳负担。
     所有地方的粮款，
     县区不能随便＠。
     每亩至多五市斤，
     行政公署统一管，
     全年征收农业税，
     夏秋两季分别＠，
     如无夏收的地区，
     秋季一次征收完。
     便利人民来缴纳，
     保证供给不困难，
     除缴粮食与花布，
     还可缴草和现款，
     如遇水、旱、虫、雹灾
     缴纳公粮有困难，
     政府根据实情况，
     可以缓征或减免。
