Xinhua News Agency, Xing County, 16th. The agricultural production of Guojiacha Village in Lin County, western Shanxi, has rapidly developed, exceeding the level before the War of Resistance Against Japan, and the farmers are living a happy and prosperous life. This is the result of rent and interest reduction since the establishment of the democratic government in the area in 1940, especially the land reform the year before last and the great production movement last year. Before the War of Resistance, the village had 52 households with 260 people; now it has increased to 100 households with 410 people, owning more than 2,600 mu of land. The average yield per mu before the war in 1937 was 1.9 dou, while last year it was 2.4 dou, a difference of 0.5 dou more than 1937. The rainfall last year and in 1937 was roughly the same. Before the war, cattle and sheep in the village mostly belonged to landlords and rich peasants. Now there are 23 cattle and donkeys and 200 sheep, all owned by the peasants. The peasants work hard and cultivate meticulously. In the past, due to the lack of livestock, the land was plowed only once at most, but last year autumn plowing was done twice on eight-tenths of the total cultivated area. The average amount of fertilizer applied per mu increased from more than one dan to three dan. Peasants bought large quantities of human and animal manure from towns and cities and applied it to the land. The organization of labor mutual aid improved labor productivity. Crops that used to be weeded twice are now mostly weeded three times. All land has been universally improved with work done on field edges and water channels. As one farmer said, "We have Chairman Mao's blue sky above our heads, and we tread on our own land. Whatever we harvest is all ours. Everyone is willing to make the land better." Before the War of Resistance, the village had no spinning wheels at all. Now the sound of spinning thread can be heard in every home. There are 105 spinning wheels and 13 looms, partially solving the problem of clothing.

The development of production has brought the village farmers a new life of abundance in food and clothing, prosperity in both population and wealth. Fifty-two households have a surplus of one to three shi of grain after deducting annual food and clothing expenses, 41 households have enough food and clothing for the whole year, and only seven households lack grain for one or two months, of which three households are due to marriage and new family members, and four households due to extravagance. The living standard has generally risen. Among the 100 households, 85 are middle peasants (including 48 who turned over after rent reduction), and only 11 are poor peasants. Xin Zhongnong (new middle peasant) Gao Qingan said, "Now, wherever you go, you can't find anyone crying for food and warmth anymore. Life is like the flowing water in the river." This is a huge change compared to before the War of Resistance. At that time, the village was extremely poor, with 39 poor peasant households and only six middle peasant households. They had to hand over more than 60 percent of their annual harvest as rent to landlords and rich peasants. Twelve households had to abandon their homes and flee due to the inability to make a living. The new society has changed everything. Those without land have land, those who fled have returned, eight idlers who did not engage in production have been transformed into producers, and even more than 60 women who never worked in the fields before have joined in weeding. It has become a glorious custom to get rich through labor and develop production. With the improvement of living conditions, the 21 bachelors who were over 30 years old in the old days have also established happy families. Bachelor Gao Youhua was once stripped naked by a landlord and driven out of the village for failing to pay rent. Now his family of four lives in the landlord's courtyard, the eldest child is in school, and the family raises a cow and six sheep, with a surplus of more than 800 jin of grain. People no longer worry about life. There are more weddings and births. Last year alone, 11 young couples got married. The population is booming, and the original houses were not enough to live in, so they collectively built more than 30 new cave dwellings through mutual aid.

Now that the Spring Festival is over, the village farmers are enthusiastically preparing for spring plowing. In every courtyard, there is a pile of manure as tall as a person, and under the eaves are the ears of grain left as seeds. Everyone is busy adding feed and grass to cattle and donkeys and repairing farm tools. In an atmosphere of boundless joy, the villagers' congress unanimously approved a plan to further increase production this year.

　　临县郭家岔村生产成就大
  　农业生产超过战前水平
    农民衣食丰裕人财两旺
    【新华社兴县十六日电】山西西部临县郭家岔村的农业生产迅速地发展，超过了抗日战争前水平，农民过着快乐丰裕的生活。这是该区自一九四○年建立民主政府以来，经过减租减息，特别是前年土地改革和去年大生产运动的结果。该村抗战前为五十二户，二百六十口人，现在增至一百户，四百一十口人，有土地两千六百多亩，每亩地的平均收获量，抗战前的一九三七年为一斗九升，去年为二斗四升，去年较一九三七年多产五升。而去年和一九三七年的雨量差不多是同样的。抗战前，该村的牛、羊多是地主富农的。现在有牛驴二十三头，羊二百只，全部为农民所有。农民努力精耕细作。过去由于缺少牲畜，土地顶多翻犁一次，去年秋翻地犁两次的达到全部耕地面积的十分之八。每亩施肥量平均由一担多增到三担。农民到城镇大批买回人、畜粪上到地里。劳动互助的组织，提高了劳动生产效率，从前锄两次的庄稼，现在多半都锄三次。所有土地普遍进行了修地边和修水道等工作。正如一个农民所说：“我们头顶毛主席的青天，脚踏自己的土地，收多少全是自己的。谁都愿意把地弄的更好些。”该村抗战前根本没有纺车，如今家家传出纺线声，共有纺车一百零五架，织布机十三架，穿衣问题自己解决了一部分。
    生产的发展，使该村农民得到了衣食丰裕、人财两旺的新生活，除去一年吃穿消费外，还有一石至三石余粮者有五十二户，够全年吃穿者四十一户，少一两个月吃粮者只有七户，其中三户因娶妻添口，四户则因嗜好浪费。生活普遍上升，一百户内中农就有八十五家（其中减租翻身的四十八家），贫农只有十一家。新中农高清安说：“如今走到那家，再也找不出啼饥号寒的人了，日子过得都和河里的活流水一样。”比起抗战前来这是一个天大的变化。那时该村极为贫苦，五十二户中就有三十九户贫农，中农只有六户，他们一年的收获有百分之六十以上作为租子交给地主和富农。有十二户因无法生活而弃家外逃。新社会改变了一切，没地的有地了，逃亡在外的回来了，八个不事生产的二流子转变成生产者了，连从前根本不上地的妇女，也有六十多个参加锄草了，劳动致富生产发家成了光荣的风气。随着生活的改善，旧时上了三十多岁未娶老婆的二十一个单身汉，也建立起了幸福的家庭。单身汉高有华从前因交不起地租，被地主剥光衣服，打了一顿撵出村外，现在一家四口搬住在地主院内，大孩入学念书，家里喂一头牛、六只羊，余粮八百多斤。人们不再忧虑生活。结婚生子的喜事格外多，单去年就有十一双男女青年配成佳偶。人口兴旺，原有房舍不够住了，集体互助修筑起三十多孔新窑洞。
    现在春节已过，该村农民正火热地准备春耕。家家院外堆着一人高的粪堆，屋檐下晒着留作种籽的谷穗。大家都忙着给牛、驴添料加草，修理农具。在无限欢愉的空气中，村民大会一致通过了今年进一步提高生产的计划。
