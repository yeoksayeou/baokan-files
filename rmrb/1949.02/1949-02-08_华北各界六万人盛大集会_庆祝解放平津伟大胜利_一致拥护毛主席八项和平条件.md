Xinhua News Agency, North China, 6th -- After the news of the liberation of Peiping arrived, people from all walks of life in North China held a celebration rally with more than 60,000 people in Shijiazhuang on the afternoon of the 1st. Workers, farmers, soldiers, students, citizens, merchants, and women, holding high portraits of Chairman Mao, waving red and green flags, with the sound of gongs and drums, twisting and dancing, singing songs, and shouting slogans, poured into the venue like a tide from factories, from rural areas dozens of miles around, from barracks, from schools, and from shops. The vast venue of seventy or eighty acres was almost full, and the teams behind were still coming in a steady stream. The surrounding houses, walls, mounds, and trees were all crowded with spectators. This was an unprecedented event in Shijiazhuang.

At 6:10 PM, the conference was announced to begin amidst the booming of salutes and the majestic sound of military music. After Mayor Ke Qingshi, chairman of the conference, delivered the opening remarks, the first to speak was Dong Biwu, Chairman of the North China People's Government. Chairman Dong said: "With the liberation of Peiping and Tientsin, North China is basically liberated, and the liberation of the whole country is not far off. The entire Chinese people will be completely liberated. This is the result of the Chinese people's century-long struggle for their own liberation, especially the nearly thirty years of heroic struggle under the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party. The people have won, and the enemies of the people have been defeated. The whole of China and the world cannot but recognize this victory of the Chinese people. Because of this, the enemies of the Chinese people are trying to prolong their lives by relying on the conspiracy of fake peace, but the Chinese Communist Party and the Chinese people have enough experience after more than twenty years of cruel struggle and will not be fooled by the enemy again. If we want peace, we must thoroughly implement Chairman Mao's eight conditions, not missing a single one. The first is to severely punish the war criminals. The war criminals have massacred how many Chinese people and how many patriotic people. If the war criminals are not punished, the Chinese people cannot have true peace." Chairman Dong called on the people of North China to work hard on production and construction, actively support the front, and step up their studies. Under the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party and the North China People's Government, they should continue to strive for the complete liberation of the country.

Xiao Ke, Deputy Commander of the North China Military Region, emphasized the importance of punishing war criminals in his speech. He expressed great indignation at the Kuomintang traitorous government's acquittal of Okamura Neiji, the chief war criminal of the Japanese invasion of China. He said: "Everyone knows that Okamura is the chief culprit in the massacre of the people of North China. The people of North China will never forget this blood debt and should escort him to the people of North China for trial." Deputy Commander Xiao called on everyone not to be lenient with war criminals. "We must pursue these war criminals to the ends of the earth until they are brought to justice by the people."

Li Xijiu, a democratic elder at the age of seventy-seven, said: "This victory is a great victory for the people. The victory of the Xinhai Revolution and the Great Revolution from 1925 to 1927 are much smaller than this. Those victories were destroyed by Yuan Shikai and Chiang Kai-shek, but today's victory has the correct leadership of the Communist Party to guarantee it. Only the peace based on Chairman Mao's eight conditions is the true peace that the Chinese people demand!"

Mr. Wu Han, a member of the Central Committee of the Democratic League, said: "Today, we are here to celebrate the liberation of Peiping, the second largest city in China. I believe that before long, we will successively celebrate the liberation of Nanjing, Shanghai, Wuhan, Guangzhou, and Taiwan. The day of national liberation is already within our grasp." He said: "Such an unprecedented victory is mainly due to the strength of the people, the strength of the People's Liberation Army, and the strength of the proletarian party – the Communist Party. All victories belong to the people, and all glory belongs to the people." He firmly stated that the Democratic League advocates the realization of complete democracy and lasting peace. He believes that only the realization of the eight peace conditions of Chairman Mao of the CCP is the real peace. The strength of the people of the whole country and the strength of all democratic parties must unite under the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party.

Lan Gongwu, Vice Chairman of the North China People's Government, reported to everyone on what he had seen and heard at the front lines of Peiping and Tientsin, and reported on the vigorous morale of the People's Liberation Army at the front lines and the enthusiasm of the laborers supporting the front.

Liang Yongfu, an alternate member of the All-China Federation of Trade Unions and an old worker who participated in the "February 7th" strike, said: "Now that Chiang Kai-shek has stepped down and replaced him with Li Zongren, they are playing the 'peace' conspiracy because they have been defeated. We must not be fooled by them. We must realize true peace, not fake peace. We must work hard to produce and support the front, and the front and the rear must work together to carry the revolution through to the end." Other speakers at the conference included peasant representative Song Gongyi, women's representative Yin Cuifang, Shanghai-Suzhou-Hangzhou student representative Yuan Keren, and business representative Zhao Lisheng, among others. They all pointed out that the peace that Chiang Kai-shek is engaged in is a guise, and this conspiracy must be exposed to the people of the whole country so that the people's democratic cause can achieve a complete victory throughout the country. The conference passed a telegram endorsing Chairman Mao's statement on the current situation. A grand torchlight parade was held after the meeting.

　　华北各界六万人盛大集会
    庆祝解放平津伟大胜利
    一致拥护毛主席八项和平条件
    董必武主席号召努力生产建设支前
    【新华社华北六日电】北平解放的消息传来后，华北各界于一日下午在石家庄召开六万多人的庆祝胜利大会。工人、农民、部队、学生、市民、商人、妇女们，从工厂，从周围数十里的农村，从兵营，从学校，从商店，高擎毛主席画像，招展着红绿彩旗，锣鼓喧天，跳着扭着，唱着歌，喊着口号，从四面八方象潮水一样涌进会场，七、八十亩宽阔的会场，快要挤满了，后面的队伍还在源源而来，会场四周的房上、墙上、土堆上、树上，都围满了观众。这是石家庄空前的会。  　六时十分，大会在轰鸣的礼炮和雄壮的军乐声中宣布开始，大会主席柯庆施市长致开会词后，第一个讲话的是华北人民政府董必武主席。董主席说：“平津解放，华北基本解放，全国解放亦为期不远，全中国人民就要彻底翻身了。这是中国人民一百年来为自身解放奋斗，特别是近三十年在中国共产党领导下英勇奋斗的结果。人民胜利了，人民的敌人打败了，全中国全世界都不能不承认中国人民的这个胜利。因为这样，中国人民的敌人就企图依靠假和平的阴谋来苟延残喘，但是中国共产党与中国人民经过二十多年的残酷斗争，已有了足够的经验，不会再上敌人的当了。要和平，就一定要彻底执行毛主席的八项条件，缺一条都不行。头一条就是严惩战犯。战犯们屠杀了多少中国人民，多少爱国志士，战犯不惩办，中国人民就不能有真正的和平。”董主席号召全华北人民努力生产建设，积极支援前线，加紧学习，在中国共产党和华北人民政府领导下，为全国的彻底解放而继续奋斗。
    华北军区萧克副司令员在讲话中，特别强调惩办战犯的重要性。他对于国民党卖国政府把日本侵华首要战犯冈村宁次宣判无罪一事，表示极大的愤恨。他说：“谁都知道冈村是屠杀华北人民最多的元凶。这个血海深仇，华北人民是忘不了的，应该将他押解到华北人民面前来审判”。萧副司令员号召大家不要宽容战犯，“这些战犯们一天不受到人民的审判，我们就一定要追他们到天涯海角。”
    七七高龄的民主老人李锡九先生说：“这次胜利是人民的大胜利。辛亥革命、一九二五年至一九二七年大革命的胜利，比起这次渺小多了。那些胜利都被袁世凯、蒋介石们所破坏了，今天的胜利却有了共产党的正确领导来保证。只有毛主席这八项条件的和平，才是中国人民所要求的真和平！”
    民主同盟中央委员吴晗先生说：“今天在这儿庆祝中国第二大城市北平的解放，相信不要多久，我们将要接连地庆祝南京、上海、武汉、广州、台湾的解放，全国解放的日子已经屈指可数了。”他说：“象这样一种史无前例的胜利，主要的是由于人民大众的力量，是由于人民解放军的力量，是由于无产阶级政党——共产党的力量，一切胜利属于人民，一切光荣属于人民。”他坚决表示民主同盟主张实现彻底的民主和永久的和平。他认为只有实现中共毛主席的八项和平条件才是真正的和平。全国人民的力量，各民主党派的力量，必须在中国共产党领导下团结起来。
    华北人民政府蓝公武副主席向大家报告了他在平津前线的见闻，报告了前线人民解放军的旺盛士气和民工们支援前线的热情盛况。
    中华全国总工会候补执行委员、“二七”罢工参加者老工人梁永福说：“现在蒋介石下台了，却换上一个李宗仁，他们打败了，就来玩弄‘和平’阴谋，我们可不要上他们的当。我们一定要实现真和平，不要假和平。我们要努力生产支援前线，前后方一齐努力，把革命进行到底。”在大会上讲话的人还有农民代表宋公义、妇女代表殷翠芳、沪苏杭学生代表袁克仁和商界代表赵力生等。他们一致指出蒋介石所搞的和平是一个幌子，必须在全国人民面前揭穿这个阴谋，使人民民主事业在全国获得彻底胜利。大会通过了拥护毛主席关于目前时局声明的通电。会后举行盛大的火炬游行。
