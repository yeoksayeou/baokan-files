[Taihang Telegram] In the coal and iron industries of Huguan, Lingchuan, Changzhi and other counties, the prevailing wage system suffers from serious egalitarian tendencies, hindering the recovery and development of the iron industry. The wage difference between technicians, ordinary workers, and apprentices in various coal mines and iron furnaces is minimal. In Chenzhai Small Blast Furnace in Huguan, the furnace head (technician) earns 18 yuan (new currency) per day, the "Erbashi" (second-class technician) also earns 18 yuan, and the "Xiaofen" (apprentice) earns 16 yuan. The bonus for overproduction is calculated in the same proportion. In Yuanzhuang Small Blast Furnace in Lingchuan, the furnace head earns 20 yuan per day, the "Erbashi" 18 yuan, and the "Xiaofen" 16 yuan. In Shuanggangyu Coal Mine in the Fourth District of Changzhi, underground workers earn only three more baskets of coal than those working above ground. Cige Dao Coal Mine does not distinguish between underground and above-ground work; the standard daily wage is uniformly 20 yuan. In Xixi shovel furnace in Huguan, bonuses are distributed equally among technicians, ordinary workers, and apprentices. This egalitarian wage system is prevalent in the Upper Party (Shangdang) coal and iron industry area, led by Yincheng in Changzhi. As a result, technology declines, the quality of finished products deteriorates, sales become difficult, and the enthusiasm and creativity of workers for production and learning techniques, as well as internal unity, are affected. For example, an old coal worker in Chenzhai Coal Kiln in Huguan said with dissatisfaction: "Now everyone in the kiln is the same. Having skills (technology) is useless. Let the young people do it." The production morale of technicians is lowered. According to the Iron Industry Technology Inspection Team jointly formed by the Upper Party Iron Industry Company, Taihang Industrial Company, and Changzhi County United Cooperative, after inspecting Hengshui, Linqing, Xingtai, Handan and other places, merchants in various places reflected that the quality of Yincheng iron goods is rough and has quickly been reduced to "superior raw materials." For example, the flat-headed nails, previously made seventy from one catty of iron, can now only be made forty. Due to the egalitarian wage system, the problem of lack of technicians has followed. The technicians of Changzhi and Gaoping have always relied on Huguan and Lingchuan counties, but Huguan is currently struggling to solve the problem of the lack of technicians in its own county. The Second and Fifth Districts originally planned to restore two blast furnaces, but they were aborted due to lack of technicians. Lingchuan currently has only five iron furnace workers left. In 1949, Changzhi, Huguan, and Lingchuan counties planned to restore five large blast furnaces and thirty-four small blast furnaces this year, but the lack of technicians is the biggest difficulty. In addition to resolutely correcting the current egalitarian tendency of the wage system, the above problems need to be addressed through multiple efforts, such as promoting apprenticeship and specially training technical personnel. In order to develop the coal and iron industry, relevant leaders should pay sufficient attention to the above issues and actively find solutions.

　　长治等县煤铁业中
  　工资制度急待改进
    平均主义严重影响技工情绪
    【太行电】壶关、陵川、长治等县煤铁业生产中，由于工资制度普遍存在着严重的平均主义偏向，影响了铁业的恢复和发展。各煤窑、铁炉技术工人、普通工人与学徒之间的工资差额甚微。壶关陈寨小方炉作头（技工）每日工资新币十八元（下同），二把式（二等技工）也是十八元，小份（学徒）则为十六元。而超产分红，亦按此比例计算。陵川原庄小方炉作头每日工资二十元，二把式十八元，小份十六元。长治四区双岗峪煤窑，井下比井上工资仅多三篓煤。辞圪道煤矿更不分井上、井下，每日标准工资一律二十元。壶关西西锹炉不论技工、普通工人、学徒，均平均分红。这种平均主义的工资制度，在以长治荫城为首的上党煤铁业区普遍地存在着。这样一来，一方面造成技术下降、成品质量倒退、销售困难；另方面影响工人生产与学习技术的积极性和创造性及内部的团结。如壶关陈寨炭窑老煤工不满意地说：“现在窑上人人一样，有本事（技术）也不顶用了，叫人家年轻人干吧。”技工生产情绪降低。据上党铁业公司、太行实业公司、长治县联社等部门合组之铁业技术考察团在衡水、临清、邢台、郸邯等地考察回来谈：各地铁货客商反映，荫城铁货质量粗糙快降低为“上等原料”了。如已往的平头钉，一斤铁可做七十个，现在只能做四十个。由于平均主义的工资制度，跟着来了技师缺乏的问题。长治、高平的技工一向依赖壶关、陵川两县，但壶关当前连本县技工的缺乏问题还难以解决。二、五区原拟恢复两座方炉，因无技工而流产了。陵川目前仅余五个炉铁炉工人。一九四九年，长、壶、陵三县计划今年恢复五座大方炉、三十四座小方炉，而技工缺乏是最大的困难。上述问题解决的办法，除坚决纠正目前平均主义的工资制度的偏向外，尚需从多方面来努力，如提倡带徒弟、专门训练技术人材等。为了发展煤铁业，有关领导方面对上述问题应予以足够重视，并积极设法解决。
