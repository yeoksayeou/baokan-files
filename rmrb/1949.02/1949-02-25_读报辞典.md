It has an area of approximately 440,000 square kilometers and a population of over 9 million. The residents are mostly Berber people, followed by Arabs and Tuaregs. The former belongs to the Semitic group, and the latter belongs to the Hamitic group. Since 1905, after the expansion of French aggressive forces into Africa, they have invaded Morocco. In 1912, French aggressive forces, under the guise of protecting Morocco, signed a treaty with Spain to jointly rule Morocco.
