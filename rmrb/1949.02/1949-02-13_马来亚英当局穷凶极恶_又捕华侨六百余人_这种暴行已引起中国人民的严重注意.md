　　Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 11th. The British imperialists have carried out another large-scale atrocity of persecuting overseas Chinese in Malaya. According to a Singapore dispatch from the Associated Press on the 7th: On the morning of the 6th, the British authorities in Malaya dispatched a large number of Gurkha troops, the 26th Field Regiment of the Royal Army, the Federal Police, and the 4th Husa Regiment to surround Ulu Dantan Village near Seremban in western Negeri Sembilan State. All 630 Chinese residents of the village, men, women, old and young, were arrested and sent to concentration camps. This atrocity by British imperialists is a serious violation of the Chinese people, and it is also a continuation of its consistent reactionary measures to attempt to divide the unity between Malays and overseas Chinese through anti-Chinese activities and to suppress the Malayan national liberation movement. From June to November last year alone, according to official Malayan announcements, more than 4,000 overseas Chinese have been arrested under the "emergency measures." This year, according to an announcement on January 28 by Newboult, Chief Secretary to the British High Commissioner in Malaya, 1,141 overseas Chinese have also been arrested under the so-called "New Emergency Regulations." Therefore, from June of last year to the present, in a period of more than half a year, according to the extremely incomplete statistics announced by the British authorities alone, approximately 6,000 overseas Chinese have been arbitrarily arrested by the British colonial authorities in Malaya. This ferocious and evil atrocity by British imperialists has aroused serious attention from the Chinese people.

　　马来亚英当局穷凶极恶
  　又捕华侨六百余人
    这种暴行已引起中国人民的严重注意
    【新华社陕北十一日电】英帝国主义者在马来亚又施行了一次极大规模地迫害华侨的暴行。据美联社新加坡七日讯：马来亚英国当局于六日清晨出动其大队廓尔喀部队、皇家陆军第二十六野战团、联邦警察及第四胡萨部队，包围森美兰洲西部芙蓉附近的乌鲁登坦村，将该村全部华侨居民男女老少六百三十人悉数逮捕，并送往集中营。英国帝国主义者的这次暴行，是对于中国人民的严重侵犯，也是它企图以排华达到分裂马来人与华侨之间的团结和镇压马来亚民族解放运动的一贯反动措施的继续。仅去年六月至十一月，据马来亚官方公布，在“紧急措施”下逮捕的华侨已有四千余人。今年，据英驻马来亚高级专员主任秘书纽鲍特一月二十八日宣布：依据所谓“新紧急条例”逮捕的华侨，亦达一千一百四十一人。因此，从去年六月迄今，在半年多期间内，仅据英国官方公布的极不完全的统计，马来亚侨胞被英国殖民当局横加逮捕者即达六千人左右。英帝国主义者这种穷凶极恶的暴行，已引起中国人民的严重注意。
