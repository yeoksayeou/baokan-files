　　Should Take Care of Military Dependents in Difficulty
To the Editor:
　　I have two difficult questions. Please answer them for me:
　　1. A poor military dependent family has no labor force and no production tools, and has many difficulties in life. For example, last year the heavy rain collapsed the old tunnel, and also collapsed a large pit in front of his house, and the wall collapsed. When asking the village for help with repairs, the cadres not only did not care, but said: Your family is a military dependent, what face do you have? There is still a pit in front of the door. Should the village help with this kind of problem?
　　2. This year, when implementing the agricultural tax, the output set for military dependents was too high. For example, the same land was assessed at five dou for military dependents and three dou for others. In addition, the land of two military dependent families is irrigated by borrowing a well from a neighbor. The military dependents use a lot of fertilizer and work hard, while the neighbor is not good at working. When the village cadres assessed the output, it was one shi for the military dependents and six dou for the neighbor. As a result, the military dependents are unwilling to hand over public grain. I think it is wrong not to hand over public grain. But the village cadres detained and handed them over to the district. I don't know if this assessment of output is correct? Is it right to detain people casually? Please reply.

Comrade Li Yi:
　　Regarding the two questions you raised, our answers are as follows:
　　1. According to what you said, the military dependents have no labor force and no production tools, and have many difficulties in production, and the tunnel has collapsed, the wall has collapsed, and there is a pit in front of the door. If this is really the case, the village can help. If the village lacks labor, it is best to repair it during the slack season.
　　2. If the soil quality of the military dependents' land is the same as that of the neighboring land, and the neighbor has less harvest due to laziness, the output should not be reduced when assessing the output. The assessment of output should be based on natural conditions, normal annual output, and operating conditions. As for the military dependents not handing over or handing over less public grain, this is wrong. If farmers have different opinions on the assessment, they must state their reasons and apply to the village government to submit it to the evaluation committee for review and reconsideration. If there are still different opinions, they must file a lawsuit with the county government, and the county government should immediately send personnel to investigate and make a ruling. Village cadres should use persuasion and education for the masses, and should not detain them casually.

### 应当照顾有困难的军属

专栏：询问与答复

　　应当照顾有困难的军属编辑同志：
    我有两个疑难问题，请你们给解答一下：
    一、一家贫苦军属，无劳动力又无生产工具，生活上有许多困难，例如去年雨大，将旧有地道灌塌，并将他家门前塌成大坑连墙塌进，叫村中帮助修理，干部不但不管，并说：你家是军属又有什么脸？现在门前还有坑。这类问题村里是否应帮助呢？
    二、今年实行农业税，评定产量时对军属订的产量过大，例如一样的地订军属的产量五斗，别人的三斗。另外两家军属的地借邻家的井浇，军属使粪不少，劳动又勤，地邻不善劳动。村干部在评产量上，军属的一石，地邻六斗。这样，军属便不愿拿公粮，我认为不拿公粮是不对的。但村干部便扣押交区了。我不知这样评产量是否正确？随便扣押人是否对？请答复。
    　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　三纵队　李毅李毅同志：
    关于你所提出的二个问题，我们解答如下：
    一、据你所说军属无劳动力，又无生产工具，生产上有很多困难，并且地道下塌，连墙塌进，门前成坑。如果真有此情的话，村中是可以帮助的，如村中劳力缺乏时，最好是农闲时修理。
    二、军属的地和邻地土质同样，地邻因惰于劳动而收成少，评定产量时则不应降低。评定产量应根据自然条件、常年应产量和经营条件而定。至于军属不拿或少拿公粮，这是不对的。农户对评定有不同的意见，得提出理由，申请村政府交评委会复查复议。仍有不同意见时，得向县政府提出诉讼，县政府应即派员调查，予以裁定。村干部对群众应用说服教育，不应随便扣押。
