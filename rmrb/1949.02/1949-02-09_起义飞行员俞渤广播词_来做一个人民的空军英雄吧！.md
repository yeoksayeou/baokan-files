Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 4th—The following is the full text of the broadcast speech by Yu Bo, a former Lieutenant pilot of the 8th Squadron of the Kuomintang Air Force, who recently revolted and flew to the Liberated Area to join the People's Liberation Army, to the Kuomintang Air Force personnel:

    To the Kuomintang Air Force personnel and students of the 22nd and 23rd classes, especially the students of the 8th Squadron!

    In the short month since we parted on December 16th of last year, a total of eight aircraft have revolted. Among them are B-24s, C-46s, P-51s, Mosquitoes, and EJ-17 trainers, with a total of nineteen personnel, including eleven pilots. Nine of these eleven pilots are from our 22nd and 23rd classes, accounting for more than 81%. In addition to Hao Guiqiao, Chen Jiuying, and myself, there are also Tan Hanzhou, Jiang Shenghan, Liu Huantong, Zou Yaokun, Song Hongru, Yan Chengyin, plus Liu Zhuosheng and others who came by land before. It is truly a gathering of talents. People often say, "Your class is the glorious uprising class." We are very proud of this, and everyone in the 22nd and 23rd classes should also be very proud. Looking back, our two classes of students joined the Air Force during the most critical time of the War of Resistance Against Japan. Everyone held a fervent heart, ready to fight the invading enemy and save this dying motherland, not hesitating to die for the country and for the people. After entering the school, during the training process, we lived and worked together for many years. We remember everyone's appearance, words, and actions; we know everyone's personality and temperament. Thousands of miles overseas, only classmates help each other when something happens; when we are angered by American imperialist elements, we can only talk to classmates; when we receive news from the motherland, we can only sigh or laugh together with our classmates.

    But please recall, when we returned to China, what was the situation when the ship entered the Huangpu River? The river was full of warships, all flying the American flag. Only the broken fishing boats with patched sails flew the pitiful national flag. When the ship docked, what we saw was a dilapidated motherland. Far in the north, the sound of cannons attacking the Liberated Areas was echoing. This was no longer the sound of Japanese imperialist cannons. The War of Resistance Against Japan had ended, but why should we attack the people of the Liberated Areas? Hadn't we suffered enough in those eight years? And at that time, the pressing issue for us was that we would immediately be forced to participate in this cruel war of slaughtering our own compatriots. "What should we do?" Yes, "What should we do?" I think everyone has thought about this.

    Should we obey the orders of the Kuomintang government? Does the Kuomintang government deserve our obedience? To answer this question, I think there is no need to talk about lengthy theories. Just look at the facts around us since we returned to China. First, we suffered humiliation and discrimination in the United States. We always hoped that our country would become strong, but when we returned to China, we saw American soldiers running rampant everywhere, reminding people that Shanghai was no longer Shanghai, but Tokyo. Rickshaw pullers and coolies could be beaten and killed by American soldiers at will; Chinese women in Beijing and Hankou could be raped at will. But after these incidents occurred, the Nanjing government not only did not allow people to protest, but also followed the United States everywhere in diplomacy. When others proposed withdrawing troops stationed abroad, the Kuomintang government representative immediately stood up and declared, "It is we who requested the American troops to be stationed in China!" I ask, did the Chinese people request this? Did we ask these beastly soldiers to beat and kill our Chinese people, to rape our own compatriots? Obviously, this was just the Kuomintang reactionaries, headed by Chiang Kai-shek, selling out China in order to exchange for materials for the civil war. The gold rush we encountered upon returning to China, up until the so-called currency reform not long ago, were all acts of exploitation and plunder of the people's wealth by wealthy families. When we were in Nanjing, high officials engaged in smuggling and business, disrupting the market and only caring about their own wealth. This continued until the days before we left Nanjing. This made us very clear about the harm of the civil war to the people. But what about the wealthy and bureaucratic classes? Launching a counter-revolutionary civil war not only guaranteed their interests, but also allowed them to make a fortune in the counter-revolutionary civil war. They are the culprits of the civil war. Look at the several student movements against hunger, persecution, and civil war. Which of these was not justified? Who doesn't love peace? Who doesn't love freedom? Who wants to go hungry? But Chiang Kai-shek used American-equipped forces to massacre unarmed students, and even movements against American support for Japanese imperialism to invade China were not allowed. Let's look at a few shameful farces: the National Assembly, the Constitution, the presidential election. Everyone's eyes are sharp, and everyone can see clearly. No one has ever been interested in these fake things. But what does this prove? This proves that even Chiang Kai-shek knows that the trend of democracy is irresistible, and that being against the people will be overthrown by the people. So he staged this series of farces, attempting to deceive the people's eyes. But who doesn't know? How were the National Assembly representatives produced? Whom do they represent? What does the Constitution guarantee for the people? Chiang Kai-shek went from Chairman to self-proclaimed President, but hasn't the people's life become even more miserable? I think we do need a strong and prosperous motherland. We do need a truly people's government. Everyone should fight for the democratic independence of our motherland. Whoever represents the interests of the people, we patriotic youths should stand on that side. We must not forget that we originally joined the Air Force for the sake of the motherland and the people.

    Therefore, I decided to break away from the Kuomintang Air Force and fly to the Liberated Area to join the People's Liberation Army. This is the only correct path for all patriotic Air Force youths today. Ending this reactionary rule and establishing a country of our own people is everyone's responsibility, and only by joining the People's Liberation Army can this goal be achieved. I believe that every patriotic Air Force youth should bravely embark on this path, unafraid of difficulties. Many classmates are hesitating because they have no contact and do not have a deep understanding of the Liberated Areas. But the fact that so many of us have already come over proves again and again that only this path is the bright road. Flying over does not require prior contact. Every airport in the Liberated Areas is prepared. Take our situation as an example: that night, when we arrived in the Liberated Area late at night, everyone on the ground got up and immediately lit a fire on the runway to welcome us and ensure our safe landing. Before the plane stopped, it was surrounded by people, a dark mass, almost lifting us up. Everyone greeted us warmly. They asked us, "Have you eaten?" "Where did you come from?" "You've worked hard!" From then on, we began to come into contact with a new life we had never seen before. The people around us are the same as us, but they are a new kind of people. They all love their work, and everyone is very kind. Whenever something happens, hundreds and thousands of people automatically stand up to do it. The fields are being harvested, and the factory chimneys are smoking. Later, we learned that this is because the people have turned over and become their own masters. Everyone is working for the people, so there is no big official oppressing small officials, nor is there any infighting between factions. Just look at the workers, peasants, soldiers, students, and women smiling all day long, and you will know how happy they are now. The detailed situation is endless to talk about. Come and see for yourselves! We are waiting for you every day, and every airport is preparing for your landing every day.

    All classmates with patriotism and a sense of justice! We are young, and we don't need to die for the wealthy and bureaucratic classes, let alone harm our compatriots and become criminals of the nation. We have a future. Let us abandon the darkness and turn to the light, and truly do something for the people! Fly to the Liberated Areas quickly, study hard, and become a People's Air Force hero!

　　起义飞行员俞渤广播词
  　来做一个人民的空军英雄吧！
    【新华社陕北四日电】最近起义飞到解放区参加人民解放军的前国民党空军八大队中尉飞行员俞渤对国民党空军人员的广播词原文如下：
    国民党的空军人员及二十二期二十三期同学特别是八大队的同学们！
    从去年十二月十六日分别到现在，短短的一个多月里，一共有八架飞机起义了。这里面有Ｂ二十四式，Ｃ四六式，Ｐ五一式，蚊式，还有ＥＪ一七教练机，人员一共有十九人，其中飞行员有十一人，这十一个人中，有九位是我们二十二期和廿三期的，占了百分之八十一以上。除了郝桂桥，陈九英和我，还有谭汉洲，蒋声翰，刘焕统，邹耀坤，宋洪儒，阎承荫，加上以前由陆路过来的刘卓生等，真是济济一堂。人们常常讲：“你们那期是光荣起义期”，这一点我们是非常骄傲的，廿二期和二十三期的每个人，也应该是非常骄傲。回想起来我们两期的同学，都是在抗日战争中祖国形势最危急的时候，投身入空军的，谁都抱着一颗热烈的心，准备去和侵略的敌人搏斗，来挽救这垂危的祖国，不惜为祖国而死，为人民而死。进了学校以后，在训练过程中，多少年来我们生活在一起，工作在一起，记得每一个人的相貌，言语，行动；晓得每个人的性格，脾气。在万里海外，有什么事，只有同学帮忙；受了美国帝国主义分子的气，只有和同学讲；接到了祖国的消息，也只有和自己的同学，或者共同叹息，或者共同欢笑。
    但是请大家回想一下，当我们回国时，船进了黄浦江，是怎么一个情形？满江的军舰，都挂着美国旗。只有张着帆的，帆上补了一大块一大块补钉的破渔船，才挂可怜的国旗。船靠了岸头，在我们目前的是破烂的祖国。远远在北方，响着向解放区进攻的炮声。这不再是日本帝国主义的炮响了，抗日战争已经结束了，可是为什么还要进攻解放区的人民呢？我们八年的苦，受得还不够吗？而那时我们切身的问题，是我们立刻就将被迫参加进这残酷的屠杀自己的同胞的战争里去。“我们怎么办？”是的，“我们怎么办？”我想大家都这样想过的。
    我们究竟应该不应该听国民党政府的命令？这个国民党政府究竟配不配让我们服从？为了答复这个问题，我想不用去讲什么长篇大论的道理，只要看一看回国到现在，环绕在我们身边的事实来说吧。第一，我们在美国是受尽了欺侮和歧视的，总望自己国家会强起来，但是一回国看到到处横行的美国兵，令人想到上海不是上海，而是东京了。黄包车夫苦力，美国兵可以随便打，随便杀；北平、汉口的中国女子可以随便被强奸。可是这些事件发生后，南京政府不但不许人抗议，外交上还到处跟着美国走，人家提议撤退在国外驻军，国民党政府代表马上起立声明：“是我们要求美军驻华的！”试问是中国人民要求的吗？是我们要求他们这批野兽一般的士兵来打杀我们中国人，来强奸自己女同胞吗？很明显的，这不过是以蒋介石为首的国民党反动派，为了要换些打内战的物资，把中国给出卖了。我们回国所碰到的黄金潮，一直到不久以前所谓的币制改革，都是豪门剥削搜刮人民财富的勾当。我们在南京的时候，大官跑单帮、做生意，扰乱市场，只顾自己发财，一直到我们离开南京的前几天，仍然是如此的，这些使得我们十分清楚的了解到内战对人民的祸害。而对豪门官僚讲呢？打反革命的内战不但保障了他们的利益，而且在反革命的内战里他们可以发大财，他们正是内战的祸首。看数次反饥饿反迫害反内战的学生运动，试问那一点是不应当的？谁不爱和平？谁不爱自由？谁又愿意挨饿？而蒋介石却用了美式配备来屠杀赤手空拳的学生，甚至连反对美国扶植日本帝国主义来侵略中国的运动，也不允许。再看几出丢人丢尽了的丑戏吧：什么国大、宪法、竞选总统，大家的眼睛是雪亮的，谁都看得清，对这些假东西，谁也没发生过一点兴趣。可是这证明了什么呢？这证明了连蒋介石也知道民主潮流是不可抗的，反人民是会被人民打倒的，于是他才来这一幕一幕的丑戏，企图骗过人民的眼睛。但谁不晓得呢？国大代表是怎么产生的呢？他们又代表了什么人呢？宪法又保障了人民的什么呢？蒋介石由主席而自己封了总统，人民生活不是更苦了吗？我想我们确实需要一个富强的祖国，我们确实需要一个真正的人民的政府，我们每个人都该为自己祖国的民主独立而奋斗。谁代表了人民的利益，我们爱国青年就应该站到哪方面去。我们不能忘记，我们原是为了祖国和人民才进到空军来的。
    这样我就决定了脱离国民党空军，飞到解放区，加入解放军。这是今天我们一切爱国的空军青年唯一正确的出路。结束这个反动的统治，来建立一个人民自己的国家，是我们大家的责任，而只有加入解放军，才能达到这个目的。我以为我们每一个爱国的空军青年应该不怕艰难地勇敢地走上这一条路。许多同学因为没有联络，对解放区没有深刻了解，正在犹豫。可是我们已经有了这么多人过来了的事实，不就是一而再地证明了只有这条路，才是光明的大路吗？飞过来是不用事先联络的，解放区的每个机场是早有了准备的。拿我们过来的情形说：那天晚上，我们深夜到达解放区的时候，地面上人都起来了，而且立刻在跑道那边着起火来，迎接我们，使我们安全地降落下来。车还没有停，下面就围满了人，黑压压的一片，简直要把我们举了起来。每个人都热烈地来招呼我们，他们问我们：“吃了饭没有？”“从哪里来的？”“辛苦啦！”从那时起，我们开始接触到一种生平没有见过的新的生活。周围的人都和我们一样的，可是却是一种新的人。他们都热爱自己的工作，每个人都亲热得很，有什么事就成百成千的人自动地站起来干。田地在丰收，工厂烟囱冒烟了。后来我们晓得了，这都是因为人民翻了身，自己做了主人。大家都在为人民做事、所以既没有什么大官压小官，也没有什么这派斗那派。只要看看工人、农民、战士、学生和妇女们成天张着嘴笑着，就知道他们现在多么快活。详细的情形，讲也讲不完，你们自己过来看罢！我们每天都在等你们，每个机场每天也都在准备你们降落。
    一切有爱国心有正义感的同学们！我们年纪青青的，犯不着去为豪门官僚们送死，更犯不着去残害同胞，做国家民族的罪人。我们自己是有前途的，让我们抛弃黑暗，投向光明，真正地来为人民做点事吧！大家快飞到解放区，努力学习，来做一个人民的空军英雄吧！
