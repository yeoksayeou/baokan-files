　　Newly Settled Demobilized Soldiers
    Financial Burden Should Be the Same as Ordinary Citizens
Comrade Editor:
    Wang Guoying, a first-class honorably demobilized soldier from Xiwacun, Erqu, Licheng, was allocated 7.4 mu of land and houses during the mass movement, and settled in our village with a family of two. Now that the agricultural tax is about to be organized, should this kind of honorably demobilized soldier be considered newly settled? If so, how should it be calculated? Please reply.
　　Reader Cheng Baoming respectfully
Comrade Cheng Baoming:
    According to Articles 9 and 13 of the North China Region's Regulations on Preferential Treatment and Pensions for Honorably Demobilized Soldiers: After honorably demobilized soldiers return to the village, they should become model citizens who implement government policies and decrees, participate in various group organizations, and accept the leadership of village cadres, and should not be special. On the other hand, village cadres should respect honorably demobilized soldiers and try their best to absorb honorably demobilized soldiers to participate in various tasks, and pay attention to helping solve their life difficulties. The land allocated to individual especially disabled and first and second class honorably demobilized soldiers who have difficulty in individual action and whose families lack labor force can enjoy cultivation on their behalf. Those from poor families have priority in borrowing grain and loans, and are allowed to be exempted from corvée. Honorably demobilized soldiers who should be exempted from corvée and voluntarily perform corvée should be given appropriate rewards.
    After honorably demobilized soldiers return to the village, their financial burden is the same as that of ordinary citizens.

　　新安家的荣军
    财物负担应与一般公民同编者同志：
    黎城二区西洼村，一等荣誉军人王国英，在群众运动中分得土地七亩四分及房屋等，人两口，安家于本村。现在正要整理农业所得税，象这种荣誉军人是否算新安家？如是的话应如何计算？请答复为盼。　　
　读者程保命敬礼程保命同志：
    按华北区荣誉军人优待抚恤条例第九条及第十三条之规定：荣军退伍回村后，应成为执行政府政策法令之模范公民，参加各团体组织，接受村干部之领导，不得特殊。另一方面村干部应尊重荣军，并尽量吸收荣军参加各种工作，并注意帮助解决其生活之困难。个别行动困难而家又缺乏劳动力之特等及一、二等荣军，其个人分得之土地可享受代耕。家境贫苦者，享有贷粮贷款之优先权，并准免出勤务。对应减免勤务之荣军自愿服勤者，应酌予奖励。
