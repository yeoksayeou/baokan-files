Wrongfully Confiscated Middle Peasant's Carts
  If Undistributed, Should Be Fully Returned
To the Editor:
    In Beisanqi Village, Fourth District, Lincheng, the carts that were seized during the past land reform movement were not distributed. Anyone in the village who wanted to use them could, but no one protected or repaired them. Now that land reform is being concluded, and there is a need to compensate the wrongly struggled middle peasants, the carts have been returned to their original owners (the wrongly struggled households), but one-third (or one-quarter) is retained for the village's public use. Although the wrongly struggled households have the carts, a portion of it belongs to the entire village, and anyone can use them, only giving the wrongly struggled households the right to repair them. The wrongly struggled households have no livestock and do not use the carts, so they do not repair them. Everyone in the village is willing to use the carts, but no one repairs them. Now there are four carts that will soon be broken. In addition, in terms of land compensation, the average yield of the wrongly struggled households is about three shi (石 - a unit of dry volume measure) per person, while some who turned over well average about eight shi per person. Land compensation has reached the stage of voluntariness, but everyone is only taking out some remote and bad land to compensate the wrongly struggled middle peasants. Is this approach to concluding land reform correct? Please reply.

　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　(Zhang Ling)
    Answer: In past land reform struggles, wrongly confiscated middle peasant property that has not been distributed should be returned in its original form; if it has already been distributed, appropriate compensation should be given based on the circumstances. The middle peasant carts seized in Beisanqi Village's past land reform struggle were not distributed. However, during the concluding of land reform and correction of errors, only three-quarters were returned, retaining one-quarter for the village's public use. This is incorrect and the carts should be fully returned to the original owners. After compensation during the concluding of land reform in the village, the land yield of the wrongly struggled middle peasants averages about three shi per person. If this number is not much different from the village's average, then no further compensation is necessary. If there is a large difference, then efforts should be made to adjust and compensate. During compensation, it is necessary to rely on the unity of poor peasants and hired laborers with the middle peasants, and to find ways to resolve the source of land and property, and do not cause dissatisfaction among the basic masses because of compensation. First, efforts should be made from public land and undistributed land, and land occupied exceeding the average by a large amount. Do not force the poor peasants and hired laborers who have truly turned over well to take it out if they are not truly willing. If the village indeed has few sources and a large amount needs to be compensated, the superior government can be consulted to find a solution. The Lincheng Fourth District Government should appropriately handle the above issues based on the situation.

　　错斗中农的大车
  　如未分配应全部退还编辑同志：
    临城四区北三歧村，过去翻身运动中斗出的大车没有分，全村谁愿使谁使，无人保护修理。现结束土改，要补偿错斗的中农，就把大车又退给了原来车主（错斗户），但保留三分之一（或四分之一）归村里公用。这样错斗户虽有了车，可是有一股是全村的，谁愿用谁用，只是给了错斗户一个修理权。错斗户没牲口不用车不去修理，全村人光愿用车也没人修理，现在有四辆车不久就要用坏了。另外，在土地抽补上错斗户每人平均产量三石左右，个别翻身高的平均每人有八石左右。抽地达到了自愿，但谁也只是把又远又坏的地拿出一点补偿了错斗中农。这样结束土改的做法对吗？请答复。　　　　　　（张岭）
    答：过去土改斗争中，错误没收的中农财产，没有分配的应原物退还；如已分配了，应根据情况给以适当补偿。北三歧村过去土改斗争中没收中农的大车，既未分配，结束土改纠偏中仅退还四分之三，留四分之一村上公用，这是不对的，应将大车完全退还原主。该村结束土改补偿后，错斗中农土地产量，每人平均三石左右，此数如果和全村平均数相差不多，即可不再补偿；如相差很多，应再设法调剂补偿。补偿中，必须在依靠贫雇团结中农的基础上，想法解决土地财产来源，不要因补偿而造成基本群众的不满。首先应从公地及未分土地，被侵占的超过平均数较多的土地上设法，一般翻身较高的贫雇农不是真正自愿，不要强迫拿出，若村中确实来源少，要补的多时，可商请上级政府设法解决。以上问题，临城四区政府应根据情况适当处理。
