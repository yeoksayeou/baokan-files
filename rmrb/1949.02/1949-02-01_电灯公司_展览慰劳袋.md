　　Electric Company
  　Exhibition of Comfort Bags
    [Special Dispatch] The Shijiazhuang Electric Company's entire staff and the company itself have made a total of more than 1,200 comfort bags, and held an exhibition at the company on the 20th. The bags were inscribed with phrases such as: "You are bravely killing the enemy on the front lines, we are stepping up production in the rear." "Fight to the south of the Yangtze River, liberate all of China!" Workers Huang Yutang, Dong Jiasheng, Zhou Molin and others said: We have to make sure these are properly delivered to the front! Otherwise, we would be letting down the heroic soldiers fighting in the freezing cold! Worker Shao Liqin bought a pipe, matches, tobacco, and a towel to put in the bag and happily said, "What the soldiers on the front need most is tobacco, and a towel to wipe off sweat during the charge."

　　电灯公司
  　展览慰劳袋
    【又讯】石家庄电灯公司全体职工和公司方面，总共做了一千二百多个慰问袋，并在二十日在该公司举行展览，袋上写着：“你们在前方英勇杀敌，我们在后方加紧生产”。“打到江南去，解放全中国”等词句。工友黄玉堂、董家声、周墨林等说：我们得弄得好好的送到前方去！不然对不起冰天雪地作战的英勇将士们！工友邵立勤买了烟袋、洋火、烟叶、毛巾装在袋里高兴的说：“前方战士缺的就是烟，冲锋出了汗用毛巾擦。”
