Zhangjiakou Branch

　　Zhangjiakou Dispatch – Encouraged by the victorious news from the Pingjin Front, the working class of Zhangjiakou is supporting the front with unprecedented labor enthusiasm. Workers at the Ping绥 Railway Machinery Factory are working an extra four hours every night, even on Sundays, to complete their tasks of producing crowbars and saddles. Veteran worker Yang Huating even figured out a way to replace drilling with electric welding for handle sleeves and pickaxe heads, achieving the same effect while saving two-thirds of the labor. The machinery, tool, and assembly groups have repaired many guns and cannons in the past twenty days. More than two hundred workers at the privately-owned Zhongxinghe Wood Factory and the Enterprise Company Lumber Mill are working around the clock to produce scaling ladders. The original plan was for the electric saw to cut 7.3 meters of wood per hour, with each log requiring seven cuts, allowing for five logs to be cut. However, due to the workers' enthusiastic and intense work, they averaged six logs per hour on the 14th. The Zhangjiakou and Jining transportation sections of the Chahar Highway Transportation Department are using six trucks to transport wood for the ladders. From the 14th to the 16th, they transported 701 poles over seven meters but under ten meters in length, 293 six-meter poles, and 470 four-meter poles. During transportation, drivers and assistants were very active, not resting even on Sundays. Some drivers and assistants personally helped the civilian laborers load and unload to increase the number of trips. The Zhangjiakou No. 1 Flour Mill, the Machine Flour Mill, and over a hundred private flour mills are actively grinding flour. Production volume has greatly increased due to the increased enthusiasm for production. Wang Yiming and other machine workers at the No. 1 Flour Mill carefully wiped the oil and mud off the two grinding discs. They said, "When the enemy was here, we didn't care if the machines worked well or not, but now if the machines break down and can't grind flour, it will affect supporting the front." Technical worker Li Zhenying said, "Before liberation, it took me seven or eight days to do the wiring work for a steel roller, but now I can complete it in six days." Due to the change in workers' work attitude, daily output has increased by 50%. The main factory, with a total of five stone mills, used to grind only twenty bags per day in two shifts under the Kuomintang army, producing 74 bags of flour. Now they can grind thirty bags, producing 111 bags of flour, totaling more than 4,800 catties. All thirty-nine employees of the Zhangjiakou ×× Flour Mill work twelve hours a day, while Yang Long and Jiao Wenliang work fourteen hours continuously. They said, "We will work hard to support the front so that the People's Liberation Army can eat their fill and liberate Beiping quickly!" They endured sleepiness and fatigue, working intensely. On the 10th of this month alone, they produced 34,056 catties of flour. The daily minimum production is 26,000 catties, averaging 650 bags per day, exceeding the 580 bags produced daily under the Kuomintang army by over 12%. From the 14th to the 16th, they transported 300,080 catties to the front. During the Kuomintang army's rule, the Yushenglong Flour Mill produced only over 300 catties per day. Now, with an added night shift, the daily output has reached over 1,000 catties. Under the Kuomintang army's rule, Changshenggong milled a total of 12,585 catties of flour in December last year. In January after liberation, the daily output reached 2,000 catties, and the monthly output reached 60,000 catties.
  　
　　All Employees of the Nankou Machine Factory
    Are Rushing to Produce Assault Equipment

    [Another Dispatch] The employees of the Ping绥 Railway Nankou Machine Factory are repairing weapons and manufacturing assault equipment for the People's Liberation Army day and night. Within one month, by the 18th of this month, they repaired 84 various artillery pieces, 127 guns, 24 vehicles, 38 rubber-wheeled carts, 1,100 assault picks, 700 crowbars, over 1,000 catties of communication equipment parts, 8 locomotives, and 10 passenger and freight cars. To concentrate efforts and quickly complete this urgent task, the Nankou Military Control Commission, in consultation with relevant troops and the factory, appointed one representative each from various departments to form a Front Support Committee for the Machine Factory to strengthen leadership. The blacksmith shop and repair shop employees worked overtime thirteen or fourteen times in one month. The lumber mill and woodworking shop worked overtime for nine consecutive nights. If the method of using electric files to make assault picks were still used, it would take forty days to complete the work. After research by several responsible persons, they only needed to forge the two ends, flatten the cut iron pipe at the handle, and then weld it to the two ends, completing the 1,100 picks in three days and three nights. In addition, the workers created a method of cutting boiler flue pipes into wire mesh, overcoming the shortage of wire mesh, and the equipment produced was particularly strong and refined. For example, when repairing rubber-wheeled carts converted from car axles, they removed the wheel hubs and replaced them with new axles, which not only reduced the weight of the car but also increased the load capacity, and were not afraid of bumps. It won praise from the comrades of the troops.

　　张垣工人的支前热潮
    张垣分社
    【张垣电】在平津前线胜利消息的鼓舞下，张市工人阶级以空前的劳动热忱支援前线。平绥铁路机厂工人为着完成撬翘棍和马鞍子的任务，每夜加工四小时，星期日也不休息。老工务员杨华亭，并钻研出了把柄筒和镐头用电焊代替钻眼的办法，效果一样，省工三分之二。机器、工具、装配各组，二十天来已修配了许多枪炮。私营中兴合木厂和企业公司制材厂的二百余工人，连夜赶制云梯。原计划电动锯每小时锯七米三长的木材，每根以七锯计，可锯五根；由于工人热情紧张工作的结果，十四号一天每小时平均锯了六根。察哈尔公路运输处张家口、集宁运输段，以六部汽车运输制梯的木料。从十四日到十六日已运到七公尺以上、十公尺以下木竿子七百零一根，六公尺竿子二百九十三根，四公尺竿子四百七十根。在运输当中，司机和助手都很积极，星期日都没休息。有的司机和助手为了增加运输的次数，亲自帮助民工装卸。张垣第一面粉厂、机器面粉厂、和一百多家私营面粉厂正积极赶磨面粉。由于生产热忱提高，生产量大为增加。第一面粉厂机器工人王义明等认真将两盘机磨上的油泥擦得干干净净，他们说：“敌人在时，机器好使不好使咱不管，现在机器坏了不能磨面，就影响支前。”技术工人李振瀛说：“解放前我做一个钢滚的拉线工作，需要七、八天才能完工，现在六天就完成了。”由于工人劳动态度的转变，每日增产达百分之五十，总厂共五盘石磨，一天两班，国民党军在时一天只磨二十包，出面七十四袋；现在可磨三十包，出面一百一十一袋，合四千八百多斤。张垣××面粉厂全体职工三十九名，每日工作十二小时，杨龙、焦文亮则连续工作十四小时。他们说：“努力支援前线，让解放军吃的饱饱的，快点解放北平！”他们忍耐了瞌睡与疲劳，紧张地工作着，只本月十日一天即出产面粉三万四千零五十六斤，最低每天亦产两万六千斤，平均日产六百五十袋，超过了国民党军在时日产五百八十袋的百分之十二强。十四到十六日已运到前线三十万零八十斤。在国民党军统治时代，裕盛隆面粉厂每天只出三百多斤，现在加一班夜工，每昼夜出面即达一多千斤。国民党军统治时，长盛公去年十二月共磨面一万二千五百八十五斤；在解放后的一月份每日即可出面两千斤，一月可出面六万斤。
  　南口机厂全体员工
    日夜赶制攻坚器材
    【又讯】平绥铁路南口机厂员工日以继夜地为解放军修配武器，制造攻坚器材。到本月十八日一个月内，共修理好了各式大炮八十四门，枪支一百二十七支，汽车廿四辆，胶轮大车三十八辆，破城洋镐千一百把，撬棍七百根，通讯器材零件千余斤，机车八辆，客货车十辆。为了集中力量很快完成这一紧急任务，南口军管委员会商同有关部队、厂方，各派代表一人组成机厂支前委员会，以加强领导；打铁房，修配所员工一个月中即加班十三、四次。制材厂、木工厂连续加班九夜。打破城洛镐如果还用电锉打的办法，得四十天完成；经过几个负责人研究，只将两头打好，按柄处将切断的铁管打扁，然后与两头用电焊焊住即可，结果三天三夜完成了千一百把。另外，工人们创造了把锅炉烟管剪成网丝的办法，克服了网丝缺乏的困难，而且制出的器材格外坚固与精良。如修理由汽车轮轴改造的胶皮大车时，他们就将轮箱拆去，另换新轴，这不但减轻了车的自重而增多载重量，且不怕颠。获得部队同志赞誉。
