　　After Uncovering a Treasonous Conspiracy
  　Hungary Demands the U.S. Government Recall its Minister to Hungary
    Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 17th—Reports from various sources: After the Hungarian government recently uncovered a U.S.-directed treasonous conspiracy, its minister to Washington, Szegedy-Maszák, delivered a note to the U.S. State Department on the 12th, stating: The Hungarian government requests that the U.S. government recall the U.S. Minister to Budapest, Chapin, because the Hungarian government no longer considers him a diplomatic envoy. Szegedy-Maszák told U.S. Assistant Secretary of State Rusk that the trial of the Mindszenty treason case showed that Chapin was implicated. Hungarian Foreign Minister Rajk also issued a statement on the 12th, accusing the United States and Britain of attempting to interfere in Hungary's internal affairs. Rajk stated that since the verdict in the Mindszenty treason case, U.S. President Truman, U.S. Secretary of State Acheson, and British Foreign Secretary Bevin have deliberately misinterpreted and fabricated the true situation in Hungary. On the 12th, the Hungarian government also notified the U.S. Embassy in Budapest that if the deputy military attaché of the embassy, Kozak, did not immediately leave Hungary, he would be expelled from the country, because Kozak had attempted to observe and photograph military targets on Hungary's southern border and threatened Hungarian officials with a gun.

　　破获叛国阴谋案后
  　匈要求美政府召回驻匈公使
    【新华社陕北十七日电】各方报导：匈牙利政府于最近破获由美国指使的叛国阴谋案以后，其驻华盛顿公使席克，于十二日递交美国国务院照会一件，内称：匈政府要求美政府召回美驻布达佩斯公使卓平，因为匈牙利政府已不再认为他是外交使节。席克告美助理国务卿鲁斯克称：明曾蒂叛国案的审判，显示卓平已被牵涉在内。匈外长拉伊克亦于十二日发表谈话，指责美英企图干涉匈牙利内政。拉伊克称：自明曾蒂叛国案宣判以后，美总统杜鲁门、美国务卿艾奇逊、英外相贝文三人，曾故意典解并捏造关于匈国之真实情势。十二日匈牙利政府又通知布达佩斯美国公使馆称，该公使馆之副武官柯萨克卡如不立即离匈，则将被驱逐出境。因为柯萨克卡曾企图观察匈南边境之军事目标并摄影，且拔枪恫吓匈牙利官员。
