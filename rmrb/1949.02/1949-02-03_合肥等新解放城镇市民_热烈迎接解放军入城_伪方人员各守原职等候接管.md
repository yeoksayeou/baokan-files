Xinhua News Agency, Bengbu, February 1st: Citizens of newly liberated cities and towns such as Hefei, the capital of Anhui Province, and Mingguang Station on the southern section of the Tianjin-Pukou Railway, warmly welcomed the People's Liberation Army. On the eve of the liberation of Hefei City, news spread among the citizens that the People's Liberation Army had arrived along the Huainan Railway, and immediately firecrackers went off throughout the city. However, when Liu Ruming's defeated Kuomintang bandit troops appeared outside the city, the citizens realized it was a misunderstanding. The bandit troops were furious at this scene, and a high-ranking officer said angrily, "You're welcoming the Communist Party before we've even left!" and proceeded to arrest and beat people indiscriminately. At noon on the 21st, the People's Liberation Army truly arrived at the east gate of Hefei. Liu Ruming's bandit troops had already fled in terror. Citizens who were eagerly awaiting to meet the People's Liberation Army shouted, "Open the city gate quickly!" After the city gate was opened wide, groups of citizens crowded up and surrounded the People's Liberation Army, excitedly saying, "The sky is clear! The sky is clear!" Wherever the People's Liberation Army went, the sound of firecrackers reverberated through the sky. Commanders and fighters of the People's Liberation Army frequently offered comfort to the welcoming citizens, who responded with enthusiastic applause and cheers. Groups of citizens followed the People's Liberation Army, some running for miles and refusing to return. At the entrance of the puppet county government, the former puppet commissioner and security commander Liao Zhiying, security deputy commander Li Wenqi, and puppet county magistrate Gong Zhaoqing and others stood in line awaiting representatives of the People's Liberation Army to take over. At the same time, another unit of the People's Liberation Army entered Mingguang Station on the Tianjin-Pukou Railway on the evening of the 21st. Every household on the street hung bright lanterns or lit kerosene lamps to light the way for the People's Liberation Army. For an entire night, Mingguang Street was brightly lit, and citizens set off firecrackers everywhere, shouting the slogan "Welcome the People's Liberation Army!" Citizens of the newly liberated towns, speaking of how the Kuomintang bandit troops who had oppressed them for so long would never return, were all filled with the joy of new life.
    
Xinhua News Agency, Bengbu, February 1st: After the Kuomintang bandit troops in Hefei retreated south, the Kuomintang government organs and personnel in the city, in accordance with the orders of the People's Liberation Army, remained at their posts, protecting documents and property, and awaiting the People's Liberation Army and the People's Government to take over. This example is worthy of emulation by Kuomintang government personnel in various places. When the People's Liberation Army reached Liangwei Town, seventy miles northeast of Hefei, they used the telephone to order the Kuomintang government county magistrate of Hefei to be responsible for ensuring the safety of the lives and property of all citizens in the city, maintaining social order, and preventing any destruction before the arrival of the People's Liberation Army, and to await our takeover. After receiving this order, the Kuomintang Hefei County Government sent two representatives to the headquarters of the People's Liberation Army, expressing their obedience to the order. At around 9:00 a.m. on the 21st of last month, Liu Ruming's Kuomintang bandit troops abandoned the city and fled south. The People's Liberation Army, in pursuit of the fleeing enemy, dispatched troops into the city at around 12:00 p.m. on the same day. At that time, the Kuomintang government commissioner and security commander Liao Zhiying, security deputy commander Li Wenqi, county magistrate Gong Zhaoqing, and others were all performing their duties as usual, responsible for protecting warehouse materials, and preparing inventories to await handover. When the People's Liberation Army entered the city, they all lined up at the entrance of the Kuomintang county government to welcome the People's Liberation Army.

　　合肥等新解放城镇市民
  　热烈迎接解放军入城
    伪方人员各守原职等候接管
    【新华社蚌埠一日电】安徽省会合肥与津浦铁路南段明光车站等新解放城镇的市民热烈地欢迎人民解放军。合肥城解放的前晚，市民们即已传开解放军已沿淮南铁路到来的消息，立时城中鞭炮齐鸣。但当城外出现了败逃下来的国民党匪军刘汝明的队伍时，市民才知道是一场误会。匪军们见到这种情景气坏了，一个高级军官愤愤地说：“咱还没走你们就欢迎共产党了！”便大肆抓人、打人。二十一日中午解放军真的到达合肥东门，刘汝明匪部这时早已吓跑，急切盼望和解放军会面的市民们呼喊着：赶快开城门。城门大开后，成群市民拥上去把解放军层层围住，兴奋地说：“晴天了！晴天了！”解放军走到那里，那里的爆竹就响彻云霄。解放军指战员频频向欢迎的市民致慰，市民们则以狂热的鼓掌与欢呼相应。成群的市民尾随解放军，有的跑了好几里也不肯回去。在伪县政府门口，前伪专员兼保安司令廖之英、保安副司令李文琪、伪县长龚兆庆等都列队等候着解放军的代表去接管。与此同时，另部人民解放军于二十一日傍晚进入津浦铁路明光车站时，街上家家门口都挂着明亮的灯笼或点着煤油灯替解放军照路。整整一个通夜，明光街上大放光明，市民们到处燃放爆竹，并高呼“欢迎解放军！”口号。新解放城镇市民谈起长期压迫他们的国民党匪军从此再也不会回来时，他们无不充满着新生的喜悦。
    【新华社蚌埠一日电】合肥国民党匪军南撤后，城内国民党政府机关和人员，遵照人民解放军命令，各守原职，保护文件资财，迎接人民解放军和人民政府前往接管。这个榜样，足资各地国民党政府人员效法。当解放军进抵合肥东北七十里的梁围镇时，即用电话命令合肥国民党政府县长，在解放军即将到达前，负责保障全城市民生命财产，维持社会秩序，不准任何破坏，听候我方接管。合肥国民党县政府接到这一命令后，即派出代表两人，到达解放军司令部，表示服从命令。上月廿一日上午九时左右，国民党匪军刘汝明部弃城南逃，人民解放军因向前追击逃敌，于是日上午十二时左右，始派遣部队进城，其时，城内国民党政府专员兼保安司令廖之英、保安副司令李文琪、县长龚兆庆等均照常在执行职务，负责保护仓库物资，并造具清册，等候移交。解放军入城时，他们都列队国民党县政府的门口，迎接人民解放军。
