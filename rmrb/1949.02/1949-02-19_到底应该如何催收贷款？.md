　　How Exactly Should Loans Be Collected?
　　On December 21st of last year, this newspaper published in its "Criticism and Suggestions" column an article by Comrade Zuo Baiyi entitled "Is it Appropriate to Collect Old Loans and Collect Public Grain at the Same Time?". The main point was: squeezing them into the same time will cause many difficulties for the masses. It is specifically suggested that old loans should be collected differently depending on the region and the object, and that some newly emancipated farmers, especially those in areas with poor harvests, should be given continued loan support. Otherwise, it will cause these households to face the bad consequences of livelihood and production difficulties.
　　Recently, this newspaper received another submission from the Beiyue Fourth Office of the People's Bank of China, which refuted Comrade Zuo Baiyi's opinion, believing that Comrade Zuo's suggestion was a view of bestowing favors, and that the understanding of the issue was not comprehensive enough. It only emphasized the difficult side of the masses' repayment, without considering how to collect it back in a way that would be more beneficial to the people (referring to lending it out again after it is recovered, in order to develop this year's great production movement). It should be a close combination of collecting old loans and collecting public grain, and one cannot lose sight of one while attending to the other. In order to illustrate this point, it cited the situation in Xingtang First District where the collection of old loans and the collection of public grain were combined, and "the public grain was completed, and more than 70% of the agricultural loans were recovered."
　　Therefore, this newspaper has provided the submission from the Beiyue Fourth Office of the People's Bank of China to the People's Bank of China, inviting them to analyze and answer it. The reply letter from the People's Bank of China is published below:
Comrade Editor:
　　Your letter of January 18th is acknowledged. Regarding the two questions of "Is it Appropriate to Collect Old Loans and Collect Public Grain at the Same Time?" and "The Collection of Old Loans and the Collection of Public Grain Should Be Closely Combined, and One Cannot Lose Sight of One While Attending to the Other", our opinions are as follows:
　　Because there is an essential difference between collecting public grain and collecting old loans. The former is an obligation that the masses should fulfill to the country, while the latter is an economic relationship between the government and the masses in order to support the masses in developing production - lending the masses production capital or means of production. Under normal circumstances, the masses who receive this support will inevitably increase their wealth through production and operation, so agricultural loans should be borrowed and repaid (except in special disasters) in order to be consistent with the government's purpose and policy of issuing agricultural loans. As Comrade Zuo Baiyi mentioned in your newspaper on December 21st of last year: "Squeezing the collection of old loans and the collection of public grain into the same time causes many difficulties for the masses in repaying loans or paying public grain... those who pay public grain cannot repay loans (in grain), and those who repay loans (in grain) have no surplus to eat, and some have to tighten production," etc. We feel that Comrade Zuo's opinion is very good. Comrades who are engaged in agricultural loan work should, based on Comrade Zuo's opinion, check the specific implementation of agricultural loans (the loan period and the effect of the loan on producers) and study the reasons for it: If it is a special situation that causes producers to suffer an irresistible loss, it should be resolved according to the special situation; if the loan policy is biased in its implementation (such as the term of the loan is not suitable for the production process), so that the loan only begins to take effect, then the loan method should be improved; if the masses invest the loan in production and increase their wealth, then it should be repaid on time. To further consider the poverty and wealth of the masses is a view of relief (because it is not possible for the masses to become rich in a year or half a year or with one or two loans). Although the loan deadline may sometimes be squeezed into the same time as the collection of public grain, this should never be a reason for postponing repayment.
　　The Fourth Office of the People's Bank of China emphasized that "The Collection of Old Loans and the Collection of Public Grain Should be Closely Combined, and One Cannot Lose Sight of One While Attending to the Other." This approach should not be seen as the only correct method for agricultural loan collection work. First, this is only a method of political mobilization or administrative force, rather than a method of economic work. Agricultural loan work is based on the government's production plan and the difficulties and needs of the masses' means of production, and at the same time based on the contract provisions agreed upon by both borrowers and lenders (repayment on time). What both parties follow is the contract relationship, rather than other government-mandated relationships. Although agricultural production has a certain seasonality, loan credit must never be uniform. Second, agricultural loan work should use economic work methods to release and recover loans, and should not use administrative methods to treat agricultural loan work the same as other central tasks: organizing a large number of forces to work together at a certain time, distributing or recovering them all at once. This will cause many bad phenomena that are not suitable for economic activity. Therefore, future loan work must change the previous administrative task-style, level-by-level allocation, average distribution, batch-by-batch one-time assault distribution method and the emphasis on the administrative power of one-time collection method into a planned, organized method of lending to the actively producing working people who lack the means of production based on the masses' production difficulties and needs, after precise calculation, and it must also be a voluntary contractual relationship with borrowing and repayment.

### 到底应该如何催收贷款？

　　到底应该如何催收贷款？
    去年十二月二十一日，本报批评与建议栏内曾发表了左白易同志的“催收旧贷与征收公粮挤在一个时间是否合适？”一稿，大意谓：挤在同一时间，会给以群众很多困难，特建议催收旧贷时应分别地区、对象，对某些新翻身农户，特别是歉收区给以续贷之照顾，否则将会使这些户产生生活、生产困难的恶果。
    日前本报又接到人民银行北岳第四办事处来稿一件，对左白易同志的意见有所反驳，认为左同志的建议是恩赐观点，认识问题不够全面，只强调了群众归还困难的一面，没有考虑怎样收回来才对人民更有利（指收回后再贷出去，以开展今年大生产运动。）应当是催收旧贷和征收公粮密切结合，不可顾此失彼，为了说明这一问题，并例举了行唐一区催收旧贷与征公粮结合的情形是“公粮完成了，农贷也收回了百分之七十以上”。
    为此，本报特将人民银行北岳第四办事处来稿提供中国人民银行，约请分析解答，兹将中国人民银行复信刊载如下：编辑同志：
    一月十八日信悉。关于“催收旧贷与征收公粮挤在一个时间是否合适？”和“催收旧贷与征收公粮，要密切结合，不可顾此失彼”的两个问题，我们的意见如下：
    因为征收公粮与催收旧贷，有本质上的不同。前者是群众对国家应尽的义务，后者是政府为了扶植群众发展生产同群众发生的一种经济关系——贷给群众生产资本或生产资料。按一般情况讲群众得到这种扶植，通过生产经营必然会增加财富的，所以农贷应该是有借有还（特殊灾情例外）才合乎政府发放农贷的目的与政策。如贵报去年十二月二十一日发表左白易同志所提：“收旧贷与征收公粮挤在同一时间，却给群众归还贷款或交纳公粮以许多困难………交了公粮的还不起贷款（粮），还了贷款（粮）吃的无剩余，有的只好紧缩生产”等语。我们觉着左同志这个意见是很好的，作农贷工作的同志，应根据左同志这个意见，去检查农贷的具体执行情况（贷款期限与贷款对生产者发生的效果），研究其原因所在：如系特殊情形使生产者遭到不可抗拒的损失，应根据特殊情况解决；如系贷款政策执行有偏（如期限规定不适合生产过程）使贷款才起作用，就应该改善贷款方法；如果说群众贷款投入生产且增加了财富，那就应到期归还，这里再要照顾群众贫富等问题那就是救济观点了（因为群众发家致富不是一年半年或一半次贷款就能行的）。贷款限期虽然有时可能同征收公粮挤在同一时间，但绝不能因此而成为延期归还的理由。
    人民银行第四办事处强调了“催收旧贷与征收公粮要密切结合不可顾此失彼”。这种作法，不应看做是农贷催收工作的唯一正确方法。第一、这只是一种政治动员方式或行政力量的方法，而非经济工作的方法。农贷工作是根据政府的生产计划与群众生产资料的困难和需要而发放，同时根据了借贷双方协议的合同规定（按时归还），双方遵照的是合同关系，而非政府法定的其他关系。虽然农业生产有一定的季节性，但贷款信用上决不能是整齐划一的。第二、农贷工作应该使用经济工作的方法放出与收回，不应使用行政的方法把农贷工作同其他中心工作一样：在一定时间内组织大批力量一齐动手，一次发放或一次收回。那会造成很多不适合经济活动规律的不良现象。所以今后的贷款工作，就必须把以前行政任务式的、逐级分配的、平均分散的、整批一次突击的发放方法和强调行政力量的一次催收方法，改变成为有计划的、有组织的、根据群众的生产困难与需要、经过精确计算的贷给缺乏生产资料的积极生产的劳动人民，而且也必须是有借有还自愿的合同关系。
