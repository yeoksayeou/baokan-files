Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 19th: How to establish worker communication networks, cultivate worker correspondents, publish worker works, fully reflect the opinions, thoughts, feelings, and life dynamics of the working class, and maintain close contact with them regularly is one of the central issues in running city newspapers. "Tianjin Daily" in Tianjin, "Northeast Daily" in Shenyang, "People's Daily" in Beiping, "Zhongyuan Daily" in Zhengzhou, and "People's Daily" in North China have done some experimental work in this area and have achieved some results.

Regarding the establishment of worker communication networks, when Zhongyuan Daily established a worker communication network in the middle of last month, it first decided to start with the railway workers in Zhengzhou's state-owned enterprises and institutions and where the workers were most numerous and concentrated. On the one hand, reporters from the newspaper went to these worker masses to help them read newspapers and books, explained to them that the newspapers in the liberated areas served the workers and the people, that workers could freely contribute and should write for their own newspapers, and encouraged them to participate in communication organizations. On the other hand, they requested administrative heads and trade unions in various enterprises and railways to help establish worker communication organizations. With their help, the newspaper preliminarily understood the cultural level and work situation of the workers in these departments, discovered active and upright worker correspondent backbones, and then developed other worker correspondents through them. Zhongyuan Daily used the above method to establish five worker communication groups in half a month and developed thirty-one worker correspondents. Tianjin Daily also received assistance from the Tianjin Office of the Preparatory Committee of the North China Federation of Trade Unions when establishing its worker communication network. All the heads of the working groups sent by the office to various enterprises in Tianjin were designated as correspondents for Tianjin Daily and the Tianjin Branch of Xinhua News Agency, and special personnel were designated in each group to be responsible for the communication work of the group, write for Tianjin Daily, and lead the communication groups of various factories under the group. The office stipulated that each working group should regard the large-scale development, cultivation, organization, and assistance of employee correspondents in factories as an important part of their daily work. In addition, organizations such as the Northeast Federation of Trade Unions, the Shijiazhuang Federation of Trade Unions, the CPC Yangquan Municipal Committee, and the Yangquan Federation of Trade Unions also helped Party newspapers establish worker communication organizations and mobilize workers to write. General worker correspondents are very enthusiastic about communication work and willing to learn. The technical worker communication group of the Locomotive Section of the Longhai-Pinghan Railway of Zhongyuan Daily sent four articles to the newspaper for comments the day after its establishment. Xue Shenghua, a train operator, said, "Whether they are used or not, we must write. It will be good as long as the comrades of the newspaper can help us improve our culture and help us progress." Since that day, he has successively written four articles in a short period of time and often went to the newspaper to study how to write.

After the worker communication organization is established, how to educate and train worker correspondents is a very important issue. Zhongyuan Daily promptly processed worker correspondents' submissions, explained the reasons for not using them, told them what to write and how to write in the future, and coordinated with the propaganda and education staff of various enterprises and trade unions to convene meetings of correspondents or communication group leaders to explain the basic knowledge of journalism and help them solve difficulties in writing. At the same time, it also helped employees establish a regular learning system so that political learning and writing learning were combined. This work was done better by the worker communication group of the Longping Road Engineering Section. They established a two-hour (8:00 PM to 10:00 PM) learning system every day, reading newspapers and learning to write diaries every day, recording the materials seen during the day, and reporting in the evening to study how to write. During the old Lunar New Year, the communication group studied the differences between this year's New Year and last year's. Everyone recalled the hard days of lacking rice and coal last year and complained. The group leader recorded everyone's speeches in detail and then compiled them into a manuscript. Everyone said with satisfaction, "We are not only a communication group, but also a learning group and a research group." When they saw that there were still some old habits and styles of work on the railway that had not been completely transformed, they decided to divide up the work to collect materials, conduct centralized research, and propose solutions. On the one hand, it was for writing, but on the other hand, they said, "We want to help the leaders, study the problems, and transform the work."

Newspapers in various places have successively published many works written by worker correspondents and workers. These works are rich in content, vivid, and fresh and lively in form, and can truly reflect their thoughts, feelings, life dynamics, and the joy of being the masters of the new society. For example, in addition to publishing the daily life dynamics of 340,000 employees in Tianjin in the daily local news with major space, Tianjin Daily also added a supplement of "Employee Life" every week from the first day of this month to publish workers' works. The Beiping People's Daily, which was launched on the second day of this month, published sixteen workers' works in the "People's Supplement." The workers in the Beiping area used poetry, prose, speeches, and other forms to praise the Communist Party, Chairman Mao, the great victory of the People's Liberation War, and their own liberation. Most of these works were written by the workers themselves, and only a part was dictated by the workers and recorded by others. The North China People's Daily also published manuscripts written by employees of various factories in Shijiazhuang, Yangquan, and other places last month. Among them, works such as "Song of Female Textile Workers" by fifteen-year-old female worker Zhu Guifang, "Coal Miners Sing for the New Year" by Wang Zhanxiang, a worker at the Fourth Coal Mine in Yangquan City, and the one-act drama "Oppose Three Hands" collectively created by employees of the Prosperity Factory in Shijiazhuang have all received good reviews from readers. On the 26th anniversary of "February 7th," the "Worker Life" special issue of the New Xuzhou Daily in Xuzhou published works by workers from the Jiawang (northeast of Xuzhou) Power Plant, Xuzhou Xingye Tobacco Company, and automobile repair shops about their model deeds and living conditions. The Zhongyuan Daily in Zhengzhou is also preparing to add a special column in a short period of time to publish workers' works.

Strengthening ties with workers is an important and regular task of city newspapers. To this end, the Northeast Daily in Shenyang and the Northeast General Branch of Xinhua News Agency convened an employee symposium last month. The employees who attended the meeting put forward many valuable opinions on the reporting of worker communication work, employee movements, and Northeast industrial construction. They demanded more reports on the activities of employee representative meetings in various enterprises and factories in the Northeast, specific experiences in industrial construction, operation, and management, the implementation of labor insurance regulations, various activities of workers in the resumption of production such as donating equipment, labor creation, unity and mutual assistance, cultural activities, etc., and hoped to overcome the fragmentary and one-sided shortcomings in past reports. The Zhongyuan Daily and the Zhongyuan General Branch of Xinhua also convened a Zhengzhou worker correspondent meeting on the 13th. The attendees excitedly talked about the happiness of workers having their own newspapers and suggested that the newspaper set up a special worker garden column and requested specific assistance to workers in writing. At the symposium of correspondents of the North China People's Daily and propaganda committee members of various factories in Shijiazhuang held in Shijiazhuang at the beginning of this month, the male and female workers who attended the meeting expressed their willingness to write for the newspaper to make the newspaper of the working class party better. On the 4th of this month, Tianjin Daily invited employees from major enterprises in Tianjin such as railways, textiles, transportation, and electricity to discuss the current situation. For newspapers, this kind of symposium can not only closely contact the worker masses, but also listen to their opinions to improve the work of the newspaper.

At present, there are still some shortcomings in the worker communication work of newspapers in various places. According to the preliminary experience of Zhongyuan Daily, the most important of these shortcomings is that the employee communication work has not been widely and deeply publicized and carried out among the workers, but is limited to a few internal and external reporters to contact and organize worker correspondents, so the scope of development is not wide enough. At the same time, among the propaganda and education workers of the CPC committees at all levels, state-owned enterprise departments, and many staff members of the trade unions, there is still the erroneous view that workers are too illiterate to write manuscripts. For example, the communication work in the Zhengzhou Telecommunications Bureau, the Highway Bureau, and the Clothing Factory, which have a considerable number of workers, is still limited to a few employees and cadres, and has not penetrated into the workers. In addition, the lack of detailed and in-depth assistance to worker correspondents in business, limited to the explanation of general issues, is also one of the shortcomings that needs to be overcome.

　　各城市党报注意联系工人
  　试创工人通讯网
    成为办好城市报纸中心问题之一
    【新华社陕北十九日电】如何建立工人通讯网，培养工人通讯员，刊载工人作品，充分反映工人阶级的意见、思想情感和生活动态，并和他们经常地取得密切联系，是办好城市报纸的中心问题之一。天津的“天津日报”、沈阳的“东北日报”、北平的“人民日报”、郑州的“中原日报”和华北的“人民日报”等已在这方面作了一些试验性的工作，并收到了一些成绩。
    关于工人通讯网的建立，中原日报在上月中旬建立工人通讯网时，首先确定从郑州各公营企业机关和工人数量最多、最集中的铁路工人中去着手。一方面，报社的记者到这些工人群众中去，帮他们读报、读书，向他们说明解放区的报社是为工人和人民大众服务的，工人可以自由投稿并且应该为自己的报纸写稿，鼓励他们参加通讯组织。另一方面，请求各企业机关和铁路上的行政负责人、职工会来帮助建立工人通讯组织。在他们的帮助下，报社初步了解这些部门中工人的文化水平和工作情况，发现了积极正派的工人通讯员骨干，然后再通过他们去发展其他工人通讯员。中原日报用上述的办法，在半个月中建立了五个工人通讯小组，发展了三十一个工人通讯员。天津日报在建立工人通讯网时，也得到华北职工总会筹委会天津办事处的帮助。所有办事处派赴天津各企业部门的工作组组长，一律被指定担任天津日报和新华社天津分社的通讯员，并在各组内指定专人负责本组的通讯工作，为天津日报写稿，以及领导本组所属各工厂的通讯小组。办事处规定各工作组要把在工厂中大量发展职工通讯员、培养职工通讯员、组织和帮助他们写稿，当作日常的重要工作之一。此外，如东北职工总会、石家庄职工总会、中共阳泉市委和阳泉职工会等，也帮助党报建立工人通讯组织，发动工人写稿。一般的工人通讯员，对于通讯工作都是很热情和愿意学习的。中原日报的陇（海）平（汉）铁路机务段技术工人通讯组，在成立以后的第二天，工人们就写了四篇稿件送到报社，征求意见。行车工人薛胜华说：“不管用不用，我们都要写，只要报社同志能帮助我们提高文化，帮助我们进步就好。”从那天以后，他一个人在短时期内又接连写了四篇稿件，并常到报社去研究如何写稿。
    当工人通讯组织建立起来以后，如何教育和培养工人通讯员是一个很重要的问题。中原日报做到及时处理工人通讯员来稿，解释不用原因，告诉他们以后写什么和怎样写，并且协同各企业部门和职工会的宣传教育工作人员，召开通讯员或通讯组长会议，讲解新闻工作的基本知识，帮助他们解决写作中的困难。同时，还帮助职工建立经常的学习制度，使政治学习与写稿学习相结合。这一工作以陇平路工务段工人通讯组做得较好。他们建立了每天两小时（晚上八点到十点）学习制，每天读报和学习写日记，把一天看到的材料记下来，到晚上汇报研究如何写稿。旧历年关时，通讯组就研究今年与去年两个新年有什么不同？大家回忆起去年没米没煤的苦日子，诉起苦来。组长把大家的讲话详细记录了，随即又整理成一篇稿，大家满意的说：“我们不光是通讯组，也是学习组，研究组。”当他们看到铁路上还有些旧习惯旧作风没有彻底改造，就决定各人分工搜集材料，集中研究，并提出办法，一方面为了写稿，但另一方面，他们说：“我们要帮助领导，研究问题，改造工作。”
    各地报纸已先后发表了许多工人通讯员和工人们所写的作品。这些作品内容丰富生动，形式又新鲜活泼，能够真实地反映出他们的思想感情、生活动态和当了新社会主人翁的愉快喜悦。例如，天津日报除了在每日地方新闻中，以主要篇幅刊载天津三十四万职工的日常生活动态之外，又于本月一日起每周增辟“职工生活”副刊，刊载工人作品。本月二日创刊的北平人民日报，在“人民副刊”上刊载了十六篇工人作品。北平区的工人们以诗歌、散文、讲话等形式，歌颂共产党，歌颂毛主席，歌颂人民解放战争的伟大胜利和他们自己的解放。这些作品的绝大部分是工人自己写的，只有一部分是由工人口述，请人笔录的。华北人民日报也在上月份刊载了石家庄、阳泉等地各工厂职工写来的稿件，其中如十五岁女工朱桂芳的“纱厂女工歌”，阳泉市第四煤矿工人王占祥写的“煤矿工人歌唱新年”，石家庄繁荣厂职工集体创作的独幕话剧“反对三只手”等作品，都获得读者的好评。在“二七”二十六周年纪念日那天，徐州的新徐日报“工人生活”专刊上，刊载了贾汪（徐州东北）发电厂、徐州兴业烟草公司、汽车修理厂等工人们自己写的模范事迹生活情况的作品。郑州的中原日报也准备在短时期内增辟专栏，刊载工人作品。
    加强和工人的联系，是城市报纸重要的、经常的工作之一。沈阳东北日报和新华社东北总分社为此在上月召开了职工座谈会，到会职工对于工人通讯工作、职工运动和东北工业建设的报导，提出了很多宝贵的意见。他们要求多多报导东北各企业工厂职工代表会的活动、工业建设、经营管理中的具体经验，劳动保险条例的实施情形，工人们在复工生产中的各种活动如交献器材、劳动创造、团结互助、文化活动等等，并希望克服过去报导中零碎、片面的缺点。中原日报及中原新华总分社亦于十三日召开郑州工人通讯员会议，到会者兴奋地谈到工人有了自己的报纸的愉快，并建议报上专辟工人园地栏，要求具体帮助工人写作。上月初旬在石家庄举行的华北人民日报通讯员、石家庄各工厂职工会宣传委员的座谈会上，到会的男女工人都表示愿意为报纸写稿，使工人阶级政党的报纸办得更好。本月四日，天津日报曾邀集天津铁路、纺织、交通、电力等主要企业的职工座谈时局。这种座谈会，对于报纸来说，不仅由此可以密切联系工人群众，而且还可以听取他们的意见来改进报纸工作。
    目前各地报纸在工人通讯工作中还存在着若干缺点。根据中原日报的初步经验，这些缺点中最重要的是尚未在工人中广泛深入地去宣传和开展职工通讯工作，而只限于少数内外勤记者去联系和组织工人通讯员，因此发展的范围还不够广泛。同时，在各级中共党委、公营企业部门的宣教工作者和职工会的不少工作人员中，还存在着认为工人识字太少，不能写稿的错误观点，例如拥有相当数量工人的郑州电讯局、公路局、被服厂等处的通讯工作，还只局限于少数职员和干部，未能深入到工人中去。此外，对于工人通讯员业务上的帮助还不够细致深入，只限于一般问题的解释，也是亟待克服的缺点之一。
