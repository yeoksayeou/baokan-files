Reading the Newspaper Dictionary

　　Caucasus – Is a part of the territory of the Soviet Union. On either side of the Caucasus Mountains, the north of the mountains is the Inner Caucasus, belonging to Europe, and the south of the mountains is the Outer Caucasus, belonging to Asia. Bounded by the Caspian Sea to the east and the Black Sea to the west, all kinds of crops are quite lush. The scale of the Baku oil fields is the largest in the world. Here are high mountains, with glittering snow on the peaks, lush pine forests on the slopes, and lakes deep at the bottom of the mountains. Here are grasslands, with herds of livestock on the grasslands. The northern part of this area has a relatively cold climate, while the southern part is subtropical, with the warmest winters in the Soviet Union, and violets and clematis blooming in December.
    
　　Crimea – Is a peninsula stretching into the Black Sea. Between Crimea and the Caucasus is the Sea of Azov, with many shallow beaches and mountains as lovely as the Caucasus. Yalta is a well-known resort area. From February 4, 1945, Stalin, Roosevelt, and Churchill gathered here for a week.

　　Crusades – At the end of the 11th century, Christianity prevailed in Europe. The Pope, who held political power, wanted to carry out aggression and monopolize the world. Therefore, he used the opposition between Christianity and Islam to organize an army in Europe and advance towards the "Holy Land" where Jesus was buried, Jerusalem (in Palestine, West Asia). A total of seven times they suffered惨败(utter defeat). Each soldier had a red cross badge on his left shoulder, so they were called "Crusaders" at the time. Later, people called all Christian armies fighting against other religions "Crusaders". Before World War II, the fascist Hitler, in order to carry out aggression and monopolize the world, once lured European and other countries to organize an "Anti-Soviet Crusade." The current American imperialism, for the same purpose, is shamelessly imitating Hitler's practices.

    高加索——是苏联的国土的一部分。在高加索山的两侧，山北是内高加索，属于欧洲，山南是外高加索，属于亚洲。东滨里海，西濒黑海，各种农作物都相当茂盛，巴库的油田规模之大为世界第一。这里有高山，山顶上有白光闪闪的冰雪，山坡有葱郁的松柏树林，山底深处有湖。这里有草原，草原上牲畜成群。这片地区的北部，气候比较寒冷，南部则属于亚热带，有苏联最温暖的冬天，十二月还开着紫罗兰和威灵仙的花朵。
    克里米亚——是伸展在黑海里的一个半岛，克里米亚与高加索之间，有亚索夫海，有很多浅水的海滩，有象高加索一样可爱的高山。雅尔塔，是一个很有名游憩区，一九四五年二月四日起，斯大林、罗斯福、邱吉尔曾在此集会一星期。
    十字军——十一世纪末，欧洲基督教盛行，握有政权的教皇，因为要实行侵略，妄想独霸世界，所以就利用了基督教和回教之间的对立，在欧洲组织了军队，向耶稣葬身的“圣地”，耶路撤冷（在亚洲西部巴勒斯坦）进发，前后一共七次，遭到了惨败，这些军队，每人的左肩都有一个红色的十字肩章，所以当时被称为“十字军”，后来人们把基督教对于异教战争的军队，一律呼之为“十字军”。第二次世界大战前，法西斯希特勒，为了实行侵略，妄想独霸世界，曾经诱说欧洲及其他国家组织“反苏十字军”；现在的美国帝国主义，也为了同一的目的，正在无耻地效法着希特勒的做法。
