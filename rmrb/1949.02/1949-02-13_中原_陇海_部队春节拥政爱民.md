　　Central Plains "Longhai" Troops
  　Support the Government and Cherish the People During Spring Festival
    【Xinhua News Agency, Central Plains, 11th】During the Spring Festival, the "Longhai" troops of the Central Plains People's Liberation Army launched a movement to support the government and cherish the people in their garrisons. Before the Lunar New Year, various units helped their landlords carry water and clean courtyards, invited them to eat and drink, and paid New Year's greetings to the government and landlords. The soldiers of a certain company stationed in a village helped every household in the entire village clean their courtyards and houses, and fill their water tanks before the New Year. An old landlady said, "I have lived for fifty or sixty years, and I have never seen such a good army. My house has not been cleaned for decades, and this time the comrades cleaned it sparkling clean." In order to thank the company for their help, more than twenty women from the village went to the democratic village office, asking to wash clothes for the soldiers, and the villagers brought wine to comfort them, but the company politely declined. The cultural troupe of a certain unit dressed up and paid New Year's greetings to the democratic government and local residents during the Spring Festival. When various units held meritorious service conferences during the Spring Festival, people's representatives from nearby villages brought entire loads and armies of慰劳品 [comfort items] to present gifts to the meritorious soldiers.

　　中原“陇海”部队
  　春节拥政爱民
    【新华社中原十一日电】春节期间，中原解放军“陇海”部队在驻地展开拥政爱民运动。各部在旧历年前帮助房东担水、打扫庭院、邀请房东吃饭喝酒，并向政府和房东拜年。驻在某村的某连战士年前帮助全村家家户户都打扫庭院和屋子，担满水缸。一个房东老大娘说：“俺活五六十岁，没有见过这样好的队伍，俺那屋子几十年没有打扫过，这回同志们也扫得光光的。”为答谢该连的帮助，该村有二十多个妇女找到民主村公所，要求给战士们洗衣服，村民并提着酒来慰劳，但均为该连婉言谢绝。某部文工团在春节化装向民主政府与驻地居民拜年。各部于春节召开功臣大会时，附近各村人民代表带着整担、整军的慰劳品，向功臣献礼。
