Xinhua News Agency, Beiping, February 16th: The dispatches sent by the Associated Press and United Press reporters from Beiping have begun to take on the form of deliberate provocation.

After carefully checking some of the stories they recently sent out, one cannot help but conclude that the two reporters from the American news agencies do not need the slightest fact to fabricate stories that cater to the major propaganda efforts of their American employers. Precisely because of this, they are by no means satisfied with the already well-known slanders they made on February 1st and 3rd.

United Press reporter Michael Keon said on February 5th, "At the Beijing Hotel, formerly owned by the Kuomintang and now taken over by the People's Liberation Army, all personnel—from the manager to the waiters—receive the same salary."

In fact, the current policy here, as is generally the case, is to maintain the original salary levels of each person, adjusted according to the new currency.

Associated Press reporter Musa must have been very busy at home on February 7th, guessing what his head office would like him to say about what was happening in Beiping.

First, he said, "The Communist newspaper 'People's Daily' has no foreign news, its circulation is unprecedentedly low, and the newsboys selling the People's Daily are in low spirits."

The fact is: the February 7th "People's Daily" was a special issue on trade union issues (this day was the anniversary of the Ping-Han Railway strike in 1923). Even so, the newspaper still contained news from Hungary, Japan, and Korea, as well as a long report on the World Federation of Trade Unions Executive Committee. The circulation of the "People's Daily" is unprecedentedly high among Beiping newspapers. Its circulation that day was, and still is, 70,000 copies. The newspaper was sold out by 9:00 AM. If Musa wishes, he can go and take a look at 7:00 AM every morning. There are always two or three hundred newsboys clamoring for the newspaper, which is the best-selling newspaper in Beiping, and the newsboys can sell it for seven to ten times the listed price.

Apparently, Musa felt that such news was not worth his daily salary, so he dug up an old story from the cellar that had been promoted by reactionaries around the world many years ago, saying that a woman wearing a fox fur coat was insulted on the street by a group of students hoping to "ingratiate themselves with the new regime." The editorial department has already published a refutation of Musa’s version of this story on the 11th.

In fact, the students in Beiping know more about the policies of the Chinese Communist Party, such as the policy towards women wearing fox fur coats, than Musa knows or, in any case, than Musa pretends to know. But even Musa did not have the courage to say that he personally saw this incident at that moment and on that street, although the writing of his dispatch was carefully designed to imply that he had witnessed it firsthand.

An unsigned dispatch from the Associated Press reporter in Beiping on February 9th was about politics. This dispatch blatantly provoked the relationship between the Nanjing peace delegation and the Chinese Communist Party, even using such phrases as: "The Communists seem to be treating them with a contempt that they enjoy." However, the delegation itself stated the same thing in both Beiping and Nanjing: that they were warmly received.

The people of Beiping are naturally not merely unhappy with these gentlemen reporters—whose friendly relations with the Kuomintang and the United States are unquestionable, who are not welcome in the new Beiping of the people, and who are now taking advantage of every opportunity to wholeheartedly insult and provoke their patient hosts. In any case, one thing is very clear, that these hosts will no longer silently endure the defilement of this place by these uninvited guests.

### 美记者继续造谣蓄意挑拨污辱　北平人民已难再忍受

　　美记者继续造谣蓄意挑拨污辱
  　北平人民已难再忍受
    【新华社北平十六日电】美联社和合众社记者从北平发出去的电讯已开始具有蓄意挑拨的型式。
    在仔细核对了一些他们新近发出去的故事之后，一个人不能不得出结论，美国通讯社的这两个记者为了制造迎合他们美国雇主的很大的宣传作用的故事，是不需要丝毫事实的。正因为这样，他们决不以他们在二月一日和三日所作的已经众所周知的诽谤为满足。
    合众社记者迈克尔·基昂于二月五日说，“在以前为国民党所有而现在已由人民解放军接收的北京饭店，全体人员——从经理到侍役——都得同样的工资。”
    事实上，现在这里的政策，和一般一样，是保持各人原有的薪资水平，按新币予以调整。
    美联社记者穆萨二月七日那天一定是在家里很忙碌地猜想他的总社会喜欢他说北平发生一些什么事情。
    首先他说“共产党报纸‘人民日报’没有外国消息，发行额空前的低，卖人民日报的报童情绪低下”。
    事实是：二月七日的“人民日报”是工会问题的特刊（这一天是一九二三年平汉路罢工纪念日），虽然如此，报上仍载有匈牙利、日本、朝鲜的消息，还有一长篇关于世界工联执行委员会的报导。“人民日报”的发行额在北平报纸中是空前的高。它的发行额那一天是而且现在也是七万份。报纸到上午九点就卖完了。穆萨如果愿意，每天早晨七点钟可以去看一看，总有两三百名报童吵着要报纸，这个报纸是北平销路最广的，报童可以卖到定价的七倍到十倍。
    显然穆萨感到这样的消息对于他每天的薪给价值不大，所以从地窖里发掘那个多少年前就被世界反动派宣传过的老故事、说什么穿狐皮大衣的女人在街上遭到一群希望“讨好新政权”的学生的侮辱。穆萨对于这个故事的翻版已经由本社在十一日发表过了。
    实际上，北平的学生，对于中国共产党的政策，例如对待穿狐皮大衣的女人的政策，比穆萨知道得多或者无论如何比穆萨所装作懂得的要多。但即令穆萨也没有勇气说他亲自在那一个时刻、那一条街道上见到了这件事情，虽然他的电讯的写法是用了心思以暗示他是亲眼见到的。
    二月九日北平的美联社记者所发的一条未署名的电讯说的是政治。这个电讯毫不掩饰地挑拨南京和平代表团与中国共产党之间的关系，竟至用了这样的语句：“共产党人似乎正用借以自娱的轻蔑来对待他们”。但是这个代表团自己在北平和南京都同样声明。他们是受了热烈的接待。
    对于这些记者先生——他们与国民党及美国的友好关系是无可置疑的，他们并不是人民的新北平所谓来的，而他们现在利用可能的机会专心致意于污辱和挑逗他们的将就忍耐的主人们，北平的人民自然不只是不高兴而已。不管怎样，有一件事情是非常清楚的，即这些主人们对于这地方之被这些不速之客所玷污，是不会再沉默地忍受下去了。
