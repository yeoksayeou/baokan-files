　　Cracking Down on Private Merchants' Speculation and Manipulation
  　Grain Prices in Dui Jiuyu Gradually Stabilize
　　[Jinzhong News] After research by the local government and state-owned trading organizations in the Dui Jiuyu market of Xiaoyi County, cracking down on private merchants' speculation and manipulation has curbed the rise in prices, winning praise from the broad masses. The Dui Jiuyu market is one of the main grain trading markets in Jinzhong, and a distribution center for grain from counties such as Xi, Lingshi, Zhongyang, Lishi, Hejin, Jishan, and Fenxi. Because the local government had once relaxed its leadership over the market, it resulted in serious tax evasion and private merchants manipulating the market, causing runaway inflation. There are five grain stores in the town, each with a capital of about fifty *shi* of grain. Since December of last year, they have been buying grain themselves and using the capital of some public stores to buy 70% of the grain available on each market day, and even intercepting grain from outside the village to trade privately in their stores, making it difficult for the masses to buy grain even if they had money. Recently, the local tax bureau and state-owned stores studied the situation, discussed solutions, and convened a meeting of all stores, stipulating the following measures: (1) Establish a grain market, and all buying and selling must take place at the market. (2) When buying grain, priority should be given to the masses, and grain stores should buy later. (3) Out-of-town merchants must report to the tax bureau before buying grain. As a result of implementing these measures, order has gradually stabilized. In the five market days from January 10th to 25th, the price of rice only rose by 1,800 Jicha per *dou*, stopping the runaway inflation. At the same time, it ensured that transaction taxes were collected in full. The masses said, "With grain on the market, it won't be difficult for us to buy food!" "Now we won't be subject to the grain stores' practice of buying low and selling high." The local mining workers have also eliminated the difficulty of buying grain. (Miao Zhilan, Wen Zheng)

　　打击了私商的投机操纵
  　兑九峪粮价渐趋平稳
    【晋中讯】孝义县兑九峪市场，经过当地政府和国营贸易机关的研究，打击了私商的投机操纵，抑止了物价的上涨，获得广大群众称赞。兑九峪市场是晋中粮食交易的主要市场之一，是隰县、灵石、中阳、离石、河津、稷山、汾西等地粮食的集散地。由于当地政府一度放松了对该市场的领导，以致造成严重的漏税和私商操纵市场现象，造成物价狂涨。该镇共有五家粮店，每家约有五十来石粮食的资本。自去年十二月份后，他们一面自己收买，一面利用一些公营商店的资本，每集把百分之七十的粮食买到他们手里，并且从村外即迎至店内，进行私自交易，闹得群众有钱也买不到粮。当地税务局和国营商店最近研究了几种情况，讨论了办法，又召开了各商店的会议，规定了如下办法：（一）建立粮食市场，买卖都到集上。（二）买粮要先尽群众，粮店后买。（三）外来商贩收买，必须呈报税务局。这样施行的结果，秩序渐趋安定，一月十日至二十五日的五个集上，每斗米只升了冀钞一千八百元，暴涨现象停止。同时，保证了交易税如数收取。群众说：“粮食上市，咱们买着吃就不困难啦！”“这下可不挨粮店的出九进十一的刀子了。”该地矿业工人也消除了购粮的困难。　（苗志岚、文正）
