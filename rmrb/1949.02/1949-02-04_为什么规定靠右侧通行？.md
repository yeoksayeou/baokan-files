　　Why is Right-Hand Traffic Stipulated?

　　To the Editor:
    There's a question I can't figure out: why does the government stipulate walking on the right side? I remember it used to be on the left. But the Kuomintang traitorous government, in order to please its American masters, changed it to the right side starting in January 1946. Now we also stipulate walking on the right side, why is that? Please explain!

    Answer:
    The reason why our government stipulates that all vehicles and pedestrians must uniformly keep to the right is that if incoming vehicles and pedestrians are not required to keep to the right, unfortunate collisions are bound to occur. In fact, such incidents have already occurred in newly liberated cities. As for why right-hand traffic is stipulated instead of left-hand traffic, it is because the driver's seat of modern new cars is generally located on the left side of the vehicle. Drivers sit on the left side of the vehicle. Vehicles and pedestrians must keep to the right so that the driver's vision can easily see the vehicles and pedestrians coming ahead, so that collisions can be avoided. If traffic keeps to the left, it is difficult for the driver to see the vehicles and pedestrians coming from the left side. Especially when vehicles are approaching each other head-on, since the drivers are sitting on the left side, it is even more difficult for the drivers to see each other's vehicles, thus it is still difficult to avoid unfortunate collisions. Therefore, it is stipulated that vehicles and pedestrians must uniformly keep to the right.

### 为什么规定靠右侧通行？

　　为什么规定靠右侧通行？编辑同志：
    我有一个问题想不通，为什么政府要规定走路靠右侧？我记得过去是向左走的。但因国民党卖国政府为了讨好他的美国主子，才从一九四六年元月起改为向右走。现在我们又规定向右走，这是为什么？请解答！
    　　　　　　　杨源
    答：本府之所以规定一切车辆行人统一靠右侧通行，是因为来往车辆行人，如不规定统一靠右侧通行，势必会发生撞冲不幸事件，事实上在新解放城市中已有过此类事件发生，至于为什么规定靠右侧通行而不规定靠左边走，这是因为现代新式汽车车辆的司机坐位，一般都是设在车身左面，司机都是坐在车身左边，来往车辆行人须靠右边走，司机视线才容易看清前面来的车辆行人，才不致有撞冲之事发生。如靠左边走，则司机视线很难看清靠左边来的车辆行人。尤其是车辆与车辆迎面行来时，由于司机都是坐在左面，则司机对彼此车辆更难看清，这样，但仍难免发生不幸撞冲事件。故规定车辆行人统一靠右侧通行。
