　　Shijiazhuang News: Ruihua Bank has recently begun offering savings deposits, divided into two types: in-kind principal-protected and currency-denominated. This aims to encourage savings, help workers and people from all walks of life establish households, develop production, and promote the national economy. For in-kind principal-protected deposits, both principal and interest are calculated based on the total price of the following items: 2 *jin* of millet, 1 *jin* of wheat, 1.5 *jin* of coal, 1 square *chi* of homespun cloth, 5 *qian* of oil, and 5 *qian* of salt. Deposits and withdrawals are based on the price published in the *Shijiazhuang Daily* on the previous day. There are two types of these deposits: (1) Installment Savings: Each deposit must be no less than three units of the above items, with terms of six months or one year. Interest is calculated as simple monthly interest, with four units per thousand for six months and nine units per thousand for one year. Depositors can choose to deposit once a month, every two months, or every three months. Once determined, this cannot be changed. If deposits are suspended midway, withdrawals can only be made upon maturity, and interest will be calculated at half the original rate from the date of suspension. (2) Lump-Sum Deposit: The initial deposit must be no less than five units. The term is the same as above, and interest is calculated as simple monthly interest, with a monthly interest rate of five units per thousand (0.5%) for six months and ten units per thousand (1%) for one year. Currency-denominated deposits are divided into the following three types: (1) Current Savings Deposit: Each deposit must be no less than 100 yuan (RMB). Withdrawals can be made at any time, but the withdrawal amount cannot exceed one-half of the total amount. Each period is six months, but the deposit in the last month cannot exceed one-half of the total deposits in the previous five months, with a monthly interest rate of 0.09. (2) Lump-Sum Deposit with Installment Withdrawal: The deposit amount must be at least 1,000 yuan, with the same term as above. Withdrawals are made once a month, every two months, or every three months. The withdrawal amount is calculated based on the deposit amount and the withdrawal frequency. The monthly interest rate is 0.105 for six months and 0.12 for one year. (3) Fixed-Principal Interest Payment: The deposit amount must be at least 1,000 yuan, with the same term as above. Interest is paid once a month, with a monthly interest rate of 0.12 for six months and 0.15 for one year. If any of these deposits are withdrawn midway, interest will be calculated at half the current savings rate from the date of withdrawal.

　　Both types of in-kind principal-protected deposits are paid with the original deposit amount, calculated according to the above-described units. For the other types of fixed-principal interest payment and lump-sum deposit with installment withdrawal, if interest has been overpaid previously, it must be returned. The bank also explained that the in-kind principal-protected deposit method was formulated based on the current wartime environment and rising prices to protect depositors from the impact of price fluctuations. However, if prices continue to fall during the deposit period, even to the point where the calculated amount at maturity is less than the original amount of goods, the bank will still pay the original amount in currency, and interest will be calculated at the original rate.
