[Jinan Telegraph] To march towards the South of the Yangtze River, thoroughly end the reactionary traitorous rule of the Kuomintang, and liberate the millions of elders and brethren in the South who are suffering, cadres in counties and districts such as Nangong, Guantao, and Linqing City are enthusiastically signing up for the Southern Expedition. Since the Party Central Committee issued the call last year to fundamentally overthrow the Kuomintang's reactionary traitorous government in about a year, cadres in Nangong have been requesting the county party committee to accompany the army on the Southern Expedition. Later, encouraged by the rapidly developing victorious situation, most cadres made ideological and material preparations early, bid farewell to relatives and friends, and mobilized and settled all family affairs. Due to sufficient prior ideological preparation and improved understanding of discipline, when the county party committee issued the call, more than eighty people immediately signed up. Comrade Shi Jingshen, over fifty years old, has a wife and four children at home. When he thought of the needs of the people and the Party, he resolutely signed up, temporarily leaving his home. Despite repeated persuasion from the organization, it could not stop his iron will, fully demonstrating the great spirit of a Communist Party member. In Guantao County, 181 cadres signed up to go south. When the news of the First Prefectural Committee's call for the Southern Expedition spread, letters to the Organization Department of the Linqing Municipal Party Committee poured in like snowflakes. A letter from Ruihua Bank had nineteen signatures. Ji Tianlin of the Municipal Government Security Team had only one word in his letter: Go. Those who directly approached the Organization Department requesting to go were endless. Su Jianzhong of the Second District of Gu'cheng said to his wife when mobilizing her: "National victory is in sight, if we don't go now, when are we waiting for!" Comrade Zhang Shijun, a fifteen-year-old mimeograph operator, stated in his condolence letter to the soldiers on the Pingjin front that he would resolutely join the Southern Expedition. The cadres departing and those remaining in their original posts encouraged each other, saying: May we meet again under the victory banner of finally eliminating the reactionaries. After studying documents such as "Carry the Revolution Through to the End," cadres in Linzhang and Renxian counties greatly enhanced their revolutionary enthusiasm and regarded narrow-minded localism and personal interests as shameful. Comrades Wei Jingqing and Gui Ying, two female comrades from the Renxian County Committee, said: "We always couldn't leave the elderly before, but now we know that was too backward!" After studying, comrades with generally higher awareness felt that serving the Party and the people should not be divided by north and south, especially since today it is only south and north of the Yangtze River, and it is still for the purpose of completely eliminating the Kuomintang's reactionary traitorous government, which is exactly what we should be doing ourselves. Now, comrades who have decided to stay and those who will gloriously join the Southern Expedition are both actively preparing for a warm send-off while sticking to their work, and excitedly going through the procedures, preparing nervously, and awaiting orders to depart.

　　冀南各地县区干部踊跃报名准备南征
    【冀南电】向江南进军，彻底结束国民党的反动卖国统治，解放江南千万倒悬的父老，南宫、馆陶、临清市等县县区干部踊跃报名南征。南宫干部自去年党中央提出一年左右就可能从根本上打倒国民党的反动卖国政府的号召后，纷纷请求县委随军南征，后在飞速发展的胜利形势鼓舞下，多数干部及早做了思想与物质的准备工作，告别了亲朋，动员与安置好了家庭一切事宜。由于事先思想准备充分与对纪律性认识的提高，当县委发出号召时，一下就有八十余人报了名，年逾五十的史景伸老同志，家中有妻子和四个小孩，当他想到人民和党的需要时，就毅然的报名，暂时别离家中。经组织上再三劝阻，也阻止不了他铁的意志，充分表现了共产党员的伟大气魄。馆陶全县有一百八十一名干部报名南下，当一地委号召南征的消息传出后，送往临清市委组织部的信犹如雪片，瑞华银行一封信十九人签名，市府保卫队冀田林的信上只有一个字：去。直接找组织部要求者络绎不绝。故城二区苏建中在动员他老婆时说：“全国胜利眼看就到了，咱再不去。还等啥时呢！”十五岁的油印员张士俊同志，早在寄给平津前线战士的慰问信中，就表明自己要坚决南征。出征的与留原岗位的干部互相告勉，说：愿在最后消灭反动派的胜利旗帜下再会。临漳、任县干部经过“将革命进行到底”等文件的学习后，大大提高了革命热忱，视狭隘乡土观念及个人利益为耻辱。任县县委会景卿、贵英两女同志说：“以前总是离不开老人，现知道这太落后了！”一般觉悟较高的同志经学习后，觉得为党、为人民服务就不应分南北，何况今天只是江南江北，又还是为着彻底消灭国民党反动卖国政府，这正是自己的事情自己做。现在决定留守与光荣南征的同志，一边坚持工作积极筹备热烈的欢送，一边是兴奋的办理手续，紧张准备，待命出征。
