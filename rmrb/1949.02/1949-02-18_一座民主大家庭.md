　　A Democratic Big Family
　　Qianjin Factory Dong Xin
　　In the morning, at the entrance of the vehicle section office of Qianjin Factory, many workers came to work one after another. Guo, the foreman, wearing a new uniform, walked into the room and stood straight in the middle of the crowd, nodding his head as he joined the noisy conversation.
　　"It's not appropriate. Why convert such a labor-intensive and material-consuming car into a substitute passenger car, instead of converting the readily available labor-saving and material-saving car? We have to question it and make a suggestion!"
　　As if he had some unresolved concerns, Foreman Guo, with a serious face, started talking about work regardless of whether it was time or not, stuffing these words into everyone's ears.
　　Short Director, Fat Deputy Director, Black Union official, foreman clerk, workers... Their eyes met, their mouths open, all choked, and the casual chatter stopped abruptly, becoming quiet. At this moment, everyone began to consider this question.
　　The fact is this: Originally, the Railway Bureau and the factory instructed to convert two covered iron-sheet freight cars, No. 3165 and No. 8264, into third-class substitute passenger cars. According to the past practice of repairing and building cars, whatever the higher authorities said, you did. Before liberation, you were not allowed to make any suggestions at all. Moreover, the workers clearly saw it but didn't say anything. Now, it has been more than a year since liberation. Under the leadership of the Communist Party, the workers understand that the factory is their own. The leadership emphasizes democracy and seeks everyone's opinions everywhere. Therefore, everyone dares to speak up and is willing to speak up. However, whether proposing such an opinion is appropriate for the leadership's original plan makes everyone hesitate. "Let's just say it! To modify the '3165' car, we have to block eight side windows and dig eight new side windows. It will cost four large iron plates and forty or fifty work hours. How much is that worth?" "Furthermore, modifying cars like '8264' is much more labor-saving and material-saving. The original four side windows don't need to be moved, just dig four more. And there aren't no cars like '8264' in the factory. For example, '695' can be exchanged with '3165'; why not save labor when you can save labor, why not save materials when you can save materials?" Foreman Guo boldly expressed his opinions.
　　Dang dang dang... The work bell rang. After two minutes of silence, the opinions considered by Short Director, Black Union official, etc., were concentrated. Everyone agreed with Foreman Guo's opinion and recommended Guo as the representative to propose negotiations with the production section. Then, everyone went to work separately.
　　As a result of the suggestion, the higher authorities agreed to exchange "3165" for "695". In this way, a total of four large iron plates and forty or fifty work hours were saved.
　　Afterward, Foreman Guo happily grinned and said to his fellow workers: "The factory is our workers' own home, a democratic family. They ask for opinions and want us to speak! We must offer more suggestions for improving our work, and we must make more inventions and creations in the future." (Shijiazhuang Daily)

　　一座民主大家庭
    前进厂  董新
    早上，前进厂车辆所办公室的门口，许多工人络绎的都来上班了。穿着新制服的郭领班走进屋中，就直挺挺的站在人群中间，脑袋一摆一摆的加入了嘈杂的谈话。
    “不妥。为什么要将这样费工费料的一辆车改为代用客车，放着现成的省工省料的车不改，是什么道理？咱们得追问追问，提个意见！”
    象有什么心事没解决，郭领班带着一副正经的面孔，不管到点不到点，便扯起工作来了，将这几句话塞进每个人的耳朵。
    矮主任、胖副主任，黑工会干事、领班事务员、工人………大眼看小眼，张着嘴，都噎住了，七嘴八舌的漫谈声戛然停止了，静悄悄的沉默起来，这时候，每个人对这问题，都开始考虑起来。
    事实是这样：原来路局和厂部指示的工作，是将两辆有盖铁皮货车“三一六五”和“八二六四”号改造为三等代用客车，根据以前的修造车向来是由上级说怎做就怎做，解放以前根本不许你提意见，而且工人们明明看到也不提。现在解放一年多了，在共产党领导下，工人们明白了工厂是自己的了，领导上讲民主，处处征求大伙的意见，所以大伙有话也敢说了，也愿意说了。但是提出这样一个意见，对于领导上原来计划是否合宜？这使大家犹豫起来了。“就说吧！‘三一六五’这车要改修，得堵八个侧窗，另挖八个侧窗，得费四块大铁板，费四五十个工，值多少钱呀？”“再说，象‘八二六四’式的这样的车，要改造就省工省料多了，原来四个侧窗不动，再挖四个就行了，而且在厂里并不是没有象‘八二六四’这样的车，如‘六九五’就满可以和‘三一六五’换换；放着省工为什么不省工，放着省料为什么不省料？”郭领班就大胆的发表了自己的意见。
    当当当………上班钟打了，经过二分钟沉寂，矮主任黑干事等考虑的意见集中了，大家都同意了郭领班的意见，并推郭领班向生产科提议交涉，于是各自分头做工去了。
    提出意见的结果，上级答应将“三一六五”换成“六九五”。就这样，一共省了四张大铁板，四五十个工。
    事后，郭领班高兴的裂着嘴向工人同志们说：“工厂是我们工人自己的家，是一座民主的家庭，叫提意见叫说话！我们要更多的提出改进工作的意见，今后还要更多的发明和创造。”　　　（石家庄日报）
