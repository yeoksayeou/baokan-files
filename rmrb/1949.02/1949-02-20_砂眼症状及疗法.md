　　Trachoma Symptoms and Treatment
　　To the Editor:
　　I have had an eye disease for three years. It is neither blue nor red, and it feels like my eyeballs are wrapped in gauze. My vision is blurry, my eyeballs hurt, and I can only read a dozen or so words before my eyes start to water and I see sparks. If I cover my eyes and wait a moment, my vision clears up temporarily, but I have to cover my eyes eight or nine times to read a hundred words. When my eyes water, it also causes headaches, which makes me feel particularly painful. When I was in the Ji-Jin area, the president of the public hospital, Director Wang, and the doctors examined me and said it was cataracts. As a result, I was treated for cataracts and given vitamin A injections, seventeen or eighteen shots, two shots a day, but it was ineffective. I also used eye drops, six or seven bottles, but they were also ineffective. Later, the doctors from the Jin-Cha-Ji Daily and the Central Bureau examined me and thought it was severe granular conjunctivitis. Recently, the doctors from the Jinzhong Civil Affairs Department examined me and said it was granular conjunctivitis and dry eye. After examinations by many doctors, there has never been a unified opinion, and the treatments have been ineffective. Eating sheep liver seems to help, especially the first time. Two months ago, eating one would make me feel better for a month, but recently eating one only provides slight relief. In the past ten days, my eye disease has become increasingly severe. I would like to ask what exactly is the disease and how to treat it?

　　Answer:
　　Your illness has been examined by many people multiple times, but a unified diagnosis has not been reached. However, based on the symptoms, it can be proven that it is not cataracts. Cataracts are a disease of the lens, and patients experience blurry vision that leads to blindness. The lens can be seen as white. The villagers call it "jade stone eye." Your eyes have no changes in appearance, so it is not cataracts. We agree that it is trachoma. As for dry eye syndrome, it is only a complication of trachoma. We will describe the symptoms and treatment of trachoma below:

　　Symptoms: Trachoma is an eye disease transmitted by a filterable pathogen. After being infected, the conjunctiva will first become congested (reddened), the eyes will feel uncomfortable, with a foreign body sensation, photophobia, and tearing in the wind. If proper treatment is not given, the disease will progress and form follicles (the so-called granules). The symptoms worsen, and rice-grain-sized particles can be seen scattered on the conjunctiva of the eyelids. The conjunctiva also becomes thickened as a result. After another period, the follicles collapse and form scars. (The scarred areas have no blood vessels, so hard white scars can be seen during examination.) At this point, all symptoms gradually become lighter and may even heal. However, in reality, it is rare for it to progress so smoothly. In most cases, various complications occur during the course of the disease, such as dry eye (involving the lacrimal glands), trichiasis, and corneal pannus, even blindness.

　　Treatment: (1) Eye drops: Use 0.5% zinc sulfate or 5% silver protein eye drops, two or three times a day (the medication is mild and convenient for self-administration at home), or use 0.5% silver nitrate eye drops, but wash them off with physiological saline after application (because the medication is strong, it is suitable for use in hospitals). (2) Friction method: Use a sterilized glass rod followed by sterilized degreased cotton, dipped in 1% mercuric chloride solution (optional), to rub the conjunctiva until the follicles are broken and bleeding occurs. This method is suitable for trachoma in the follicular stage, which can cause early scar formation and lead to healing. It usually takes one or two times for mild cases, and four or five times for severe cases. (3) Surgery: Use a special dissector to randomly cut the conjunctiva. The purpose and effect are the same as the friction method, but usually only one treatment is needed. Furthermore, if there are problems with trichiasis or lacrimal gland diseases, surgical treatment is also necessary. (4) In addition to the above treatments, there is a recent method of oral sulfonamides. Experiments have also shown it to be quite effective. If used in conjunction with the above methods, it is easier to shorten the treatment period. Use sulfonamides, 3 grams per day, plus an equal amount of sodium bicarbonate, divided into three doses, taking the medication for five days and then stopping for one or two days. Continue this for two or three months to treat the disease.

### 砂眼症状及疗法

专栏：询问与答复

　　砂眼症状及疗法编辑同志：
    我的眼病已有三年之久，不青也不红，好象用纱布包着眼珠一样，看东西模糊，眼珠子痛，看书只看十几个字，就流开眼泪，冒火星子。蒙上眼稍等一时，即刻明一时，看一百个字的东西，就得蒙八、九次眼，流泪时还影响头痛，使自己感到特别痛苦。在冀晋时，据公立医院王院长和大夫检查，是白内障。结果按白内障治，打维它命Ａ，打了十七八针，每天二针，但无效，点眼药点了六七瓶子也无效。后经晋察冀日报、中央局医生检查认为是砂粒眼过重。近来又经晋中民运部医生检查是砂粒眼及干燥眼。经好多医生检查，始终未有个统一的意见，医治亦无效验。就是吃羊肝子见效，吃头一次较好些，二个月前一个时期，吃一个好一个月，最近吃一个只较好些。最近十几天，眼病愈来愈重了。请问究竟是啥病，如何治疗？
    　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　中日报社东畔
    答：你的病经多人多次检查，未得到统一的诊断，不过由症状上，可以证明不是白内障，因白内障是水晶体的病，患者由模糊而失明，可以看见水晶体为白色。老乡把他叫做玉石眼。你的眼外观上没有变化，所以不是白内障。我们同意是砂眼。至于干燥症，仅为砂眼的一个合并症状而已。兹将砂眼的症状及疗法分述于下：
    症状：砂眼是一种滤过性病原体所传染的眼疾，被传染后，则于结膜先起充血（发红），眼感觉不舒服，异物感，怕光，迎风流泪。如不加适当的治疗，则病劳进行则形成泸胞（即所谓砂粒）。症状加重，并可看出米粒大之颗粒散在于眼睑结膜上。结膜也因此肥厚。再经一个时期，则滤胞崩溃，而形成瘢痕。（其瘢痕处没有血管所以检查时可以看到较硬的白色瘢痕。）此际一切症状渐轻，乃至痊愈。但实际上如此顺利的经过者很少，多在其经过中发生多种多样的合并症，如干燥眼（侵及泪腺）、睫毛乱生、角膜翳等，甚者失明。
    疗法：（一）药物点眼，用百分之零点五的硫酸亚铃，或百分之五的蛋白银点眼，每日二、三次（药力缓和方便适于自己在家用），或用百分之零点五的硝酸银点眼，不过点后须用生理食盐水洗之（因药力剧烈适于医院使用）。（二）磨擦法——用消毒的玻璃棒，继以消毒的脱脂棉，蒸百分之一的升汞水（不用亦可）磨擦结膜，至滤胞破坏出血为止。此法适于滤胞期的砂眼，可使早期形成瘢痕，而趋治愈。大约轻者一、二次，重者则有四、五次即可。（三）手术，以特殊的乱切刀乱切结膜，其目的与效果，与磨擦法同。但通常一次即可。再如有睫毛乱生泪腺疾患时，亦须手术治疗之。（四）除以上疗法外，近有内服磺胺法。经试验亦颇有效。如与以上各法并用，更易缩短治疗期间。即用磺胺，每日三克加等量小苏达分三回服用，每服五天休药一、二天。如此服二、三个月即可治疗。
