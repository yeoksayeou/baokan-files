Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 31st -- TASS reports: Electricity has become an essential element in Soviet state farms and collective farms. The agricultural electrification plan formulated twenty years ago under Lenin's initiative has been gradually realized. Before the revolution, the Russian countryside was almost without electricity. At that time, there were only eighty rural power stations in the country, with a generating capacity of only about 2,000 kilowatts. By 1940, however, 100,000 collective farms and 2,500 machine and tractor stations had obtained electricity supply. In the years following World War II, rural electrification has reached an unprecedented scale. In February 1945, while the war was still going on, Stalin had already issued a government decree "Promoting Rural Electrification," outlining a huge plan for the construction of small power stations. According to this plan, in 1945 alone, 601 rural hydroelectric power stations were built, electrifying 2,500 collective farms and nearly 700 machine and tractor stations. In January 1946, the power generation capacity of rural power stations had reached the pre-war level. By January 1, 1948, the power generation capacity of rural power plants and generating equipment had more than doubled compared to pre-war levels. In May 1948, the Soviet Council of Ministers formulated another plan to increase the construction of rural power stations by 1950. As a result of the implementation of this plan, according to incomplete statistics, in 1948 alone, 3,250 power stations began generating electricity, enabling another 6,000 collective farms and 800 machine and tractor stations to receive electricity supply. All collective farms, machine and tractor stations, and state farms in the Sverdlovsk Oblast have completed electrification. In the Moscow Oblast, in the two years after the war, 1946 and 1947, the power supply to 2,500 collective farms was increased, and all machine and tractor stations and factories in the state have been electrified. This year, thousands more power stations will be built across the country, most of which will begin supplying electricity this year. Thousands of collective farms and 1,380 machine and tractor stations will have electricity supply. In the Urals, newly designed electricity "machine and tractor stations" will be established. The Soviet Rural Electrification Research Institute is focusing most of its work on studying the construction principles of electricity "machine and tractor" stations. In 1949, the first batch of electric tractors will appear on collective farms. Another important issue that the research institute is paying attention to is the electrical mechanization of various processes in livestock breeding.

　　苏农村电气化已达空前规模
    【新华社陕北三十一日电】塔斯社讯：电力已成为苏联国家农场与集体农场的要素。二十年前在列宁倡导下所制订的农业电气化计划，已逐步实现。革命以前，俄国的农村是几乎没有电力的。那时全国只有八十座农村电力站，发电能力仅约二千千瓦。到一九四○年时，却已有十万个集体农场和二千五百个机器与拖拉机站获得电力供应。而在二次世界大战以后几年，农村电气化更已达空前的规模。一九四五年二月，当战争尚在进行的时候，斯大林就已颁发了政府“促进农村电气化”的法令，提出一个建设小型电力站的庞大计划的纲要。按照这个计划，仅在一九四五年一年之内，便建筑了六百零一座农村水力发电站，有二千五百个集体农场和将近七百座机器与拖拉机站电气化。一九四六年一月，乡村电力站的发电能力已达战前水平。到一九四八年一月一日时，农村发电厂及发电设备的发电能力已猛增到战前的两倍。一九四八年五月，苏联部长会议又拟定了一个到一九五○年为止的增加农村电力站的建设计划。开始实行这个计划的结果，据不完全统计，仅一九四八年一年内，即有三千二百五十座电力站开始发电，使得另外有六千个集体农庄和八百个机器拖拉机站得到电力供应。斯维德洛夫斯克州一切集体农场、机器与拖拉机站和国家农场，业已完成电气化。莫斯科州在战后两年内，即一九四六年和一九四七年内，即增加了供应二千五百个集体农场的电力，而该州一切机器与拖拉机站和工厂都已电气化。今年一年内，全国又将建筑数千座电力站，其中大部分将在今年开始供电。数千个集体农场和一千三百八十个机器与拖拉机站将有电力供应。在乌拉尔，将成立新设计的电力“机器与拖拉机站”。苏联农村电气化研究院正将大部分工作放在研究电力“机器与拖拉机”站的建筑原理上。一九四九年，集体农场上将出现第一批电气拖拉机。该研究院注意的另一个重要问题，是牲畜饲养方面各种过程的电气机械化。
