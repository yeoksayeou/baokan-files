Saving Metal is an Important Task for the National Economy

The nationwide movement to strive for over-planned accumulation and increased benefits for each enterprise requires leaders of all economic sectors and Party factory organizations to deeply study methods of production saving, discover reserve forces, and skillfully utilize them. The most important source for reducing costs is to save on the consumption of materials, fuel, raw materials, and electricity.

Our national economy requires a large amount of metal. Machine manufacturing factories, railways, and new construction all need millions of tons of metal. The front line for using metal is very broad, therefore requiring all workers in the national economy to participate in this struggle to save metal. Every factory, every tractor station, every workshop, and every manufacturing plant—all departments that carry out various metal processing—can and must save metal.

The struggle to save metal should first start in metallurgical plants. Hundreds and thousands of tons of pig iron and steel can be saved when liquid metal is cast and in the process of manufacturing rolled metal. To this end, it is necessary to carefully abide by scientific theories, constantly improve them, and continuously fight against substandard products. The production of metal must strictly adhere to orders and prescribed styles and types.

In some machine manufacturing factories, the loss of metal is very serious. This is because many enterprises lack metal consumption standards. Even in enterprises with standards, these standards are outdated and cannot meet today's improved technical level. Everyone knows that in the textile industry, a certain quality of cotton and wool is consumed to produce one meter of textiles; in the chemical industry, there are consumption standards for raw materials and materials when producing unit finished products; the power sector knows the amount of coal needed to generate one kilowatt-hour of electricity. However, in the metal processing industry, metal consumption standards are often not based on certain scientific laws, but are measured by the naked eye. For example, in railway machine manufacturing enterprises, the metal used in many finished products only accounts for 45% - 50%. Can such a situation be allowed to exist? Even in the tractor industry, where material consumption standards are somewhat defined, the standards are still far from perfect.

All of this shows that our metal consumption standards are still lagging behind. These standards have not been given due attention either in the government or in the enterprises. The work of using the achievements of our advanced technology to formulate new and progressive standards is still very weak. Correct and scientifically based standards that rely on the experience of advanced Stakhanovite workers and advanced enterprises are the key to the rational consumption of metal.

However, formulating correct standards is only half the battle; it is also necessary to continuously abide by the standards and establish extremely strict discipline and management. Therefore, every worker must understand the metal consumption standards when they manufacture parts. In every workshop and every section, people must resolutely fight against the waste of metal.

Correctly cutting iron plates gives us great savings. Here, the marking-off worker plays a very large role. By mastering cutting techniques, they can reduce waste several times and turn iron plates that were previously cut into waste into various parts. It is still worthwhile to widely promote the experience of the Leningrad "Electricity" factory and the Podolsky Ordzhonikidze factory. There, great savings were achieved due to improvements in cutting techniques. At the Ural Machine Building Plant, two tons of metal were saved in the manufacture of each oil industry drilling rig due to improvements in metal usage.

Sometimes, a large amount of metal is wasted simply because the metal materials issued from the warehouse do not meet the required size and standards. These phenomena occur because in many enterprises, the warehouses are not kept in order: metal materials are piled up and various materials are placed together.

The struggle to save metal should be specific and must be expressed in certain requirements and marks for each worker. Only then can we say to any workshop or any factory that it is not just saving in general, but saving a certain amount of metal.

Today, the *People's Daily* publishes a summary report of the meeting on saving metal held in the editorial office. The participants elaborated on the issue of a large number of reserve forces, and they specifically pointed out that the struggle to save metal requires workshop leaders to complete orders for rolled metal, forging, and casting meticulously and accurately. Any errors in dimensions or drawings will inevitably lead to excessive waste of metal. All personnel in the factory must pay attention to the utilization of their products. Workshop leaders and orderers are all engaged in a common cause, helping the consolidation and development of our great motherland's economy. Therefore, indiscipline and a lack of responsibility in completing orders are intolerable.

Metal resources can only be increased by improving the collection of scrap iron and organizing the proper storage of scrap iron in enterprises. Often, contrary to established principles, non-ferrous metal waste is not stored in boxes and classified, but is left in the open, where it is ruined. How much metal can be collected in the courtyards of enterprises and on the railways! How much metal is left to rust in other buildings! The "movement" to collect scrap iron that is launched from time to time is of little significance. This is not a temporary movement, but a constant task. The Party, Communist Youth League, and trade union organizations, as well as our publications and all social organizations, play a decisive role in this.

Now that our country is launching a struggle to obtain several hundred million new rubles and over-plan accumulation, saving metal is particularly important. While developing reserve forces, Party organizations must pay special attention to enterprise leaders, composition and design departments, and factory laboratories, so that they can be concerned about reducing metal consumption. Every worker must be educated to practice thrift and understand how important saving one kilogram of metal is to the country, and how huge our waste is due to excessive waste of substandard metal products and non-productive consumption.

Saving metal can help solve the need for steel in the development of the national economy, reduce the cost of production, and increase accumulation beyond the plan. Saving metal in our country, where production is increasing and its utilization is becoming more widespread, is not only a matter for machine manufacturing factories and metallurgical factories, but for all industrial sectors, transportation departments, and the entire people.

### 节约金属是国民经济的重要任务

　　节约金属是国民经济的重要任务
    为超计划积累增长及为每个企业经营有更大利益而斗争的全民运动，要求各经济部门的领导者及党的工厂组织，深刻研究生产节约办法，发掘后备力量并熟练地加以利用。减低成本最主要的一个来源就是节约材料、燃料、原料及电力的消费量。
    我们国民经济是大量需要金属的。机器制造工厂，铁路及新的建筑需要几百万吨的金属。采用金属的战线是非常广的，因此要求国民经济的所有工作人员都来参加这个节约金属的斗争。每个工厂，每个拖拉机站，每个车间及制造厂——凡是施行各种金属加工的各部门都能够也必须节约金属。
    节约金属的斗争，首先应从冶金工场做起。在液体金属铸入时及在制造辗金属的过程中都能节省几百吨、几千吨的铣铁及钢。为此要求细心地遵守科学的理论，经常改进它并与窳劣品作不断地斗争。金属的出产要严格按照定货及规定的样式种类。
    在有些机器制造工厂中，金属的损失是非常严重的。这是由于在许多企业中缺少金属消费标准的结果。就是在有标准的企业中这些标准已经老旧了，不能适合于今天提高了的技术水平。尽人皆知，在纺织工业里，制造一米纺织品要消费多少一定质量的棉花与羊毛，在化学工业里出产单位成品时有原料及材料之消费标准，动力部门知道发一个基罗瓦特时电力所需要煤量，而在金属加工业中金属消费标准经常不是以一定的科学的规律来订的，而是凭肉眼去衡量。例如，在铁路机器制造企业中，很多成品所使用的金属只占百分之四十五——五十，难道可以允许这样情况存在吗？甚至在象材料消费标准已有某种确定的拖拉机工业部门中，其标准也还是远不完善的。
    所有这些都说明了我们的金属消费标准还是落后的部分。这些标准无论是在政府中或是在各企业中，都没有给与应有的注意。利用我们先进技术的成就去制订新的进步的标准的工作，还很薄弱。正确的，科学上有根据地依靠先进的斯达哈诺夫运动者及先进企业的经验而建立起的标准——这就是金属合理消费的关键。
    然而，制订正确的标准——这仅是事情的一半，还要不断的遵守标准，要建立起极严格的纪律及管理。因此必须使每个工人都了解到在他们制造零件时金属的消费标准。必须在各个车间里，各个部分中，使人们与浪费金属作坚决的斗争。
    正确的截剪铁板，给了我们以很大节省。在这里画印工起了非常大的作用。掌握了截剪技术，他们可以将废物减少数倍，使从前剪废的铁板，能制成各种的零件。广泛的推广列宁格勒“电力”工厂及波得斯奥尔仁尼兹工厂的经验还是有价值的。在那里由于截剪技术之改进获得了极大节省。在乌拉尔机器制造厂中，由于金属使用上的改进而在制造每个石油工业掘凿机时节省了两吨的金属。
    有时仅仅由于从仓库发出的金属材料不合乎要求的大小及标准而白白耗费大量的金属。这些现象的发生都是因为在许多的企业里，仓库保管得没有秩序：把金属材料堆成堆及把各种材料都在一起所致。
    节约金属的斗争应是具体的，必须表现在每个工人的一定要求与标志上。到那时我们对任何一个车间，任何一个工厂都可以说不是一般的节约，而是节约一定数量的金属。
    今天在真理报上登载了在编辑室召开的节约金属问题会议的总结报告。与会者曾阐述了大量后备力量的问题，他们特别指出：对于节约金属的斗争要求工场负责人能细致准确完成辗金属、锻冶及铸造的定货。一切于尺码中、图样中的差误都不可避免地引向金属的过度浪费。工厂的全体人员不能对其生产品之利用问题不加注意。工场负责人也好，定货人也好，都是在完成一个共同的事业，帮助我们伟大祖国的经济的巩固及发展。因此在完成定货中所表现出的无纪律性、无责任感都是不能容忍的。
    只有改善收集碎铁及在企业中正确的组织碎铁的保存，金属的资源才能增加。时常有将非铁金属的废品，违反既定原则，不保存在箱里和加以分类，而是把它露天的放着，任其毁掉。在企业的院子里，在铁路上可以搜集到多少金属啊！有多少金属在另外的一些房子里任其生锈啊！时这时那，忽起忽落所展开的搜集碎铁“运动”意义是不大的，这不是一个临时的运动，而是一个经常的任务。在其中起决定性作用的是党、少共团及职工会的组织及我们的出版界和一切社会团体。
    现在当我国正展开为获得几亿亿的新卢布，超计划积累的斗争中节约金属是特别重要的。开展后备力量的同时，党的组织必需特别注意到企业的领导者，组成及设计部门及工厂的实验室，使他们能关心缩减金属的消费量，必须教育每个工人要实行节约并说明节约一公斤的金属对国家是多么重要，金属窳劣产品的过度浪费及非生产的消耗，我们的浪费是如何庞大。
    金属的节约能帮助解决钢铁在国民经济发展中的需要，并能减低生产品的成本，增加超过计划的积累。节约金属在其生产日益增加及其利用日益广泛的我国，不仅仅是机器制造工厂及冶金工厂的事情，而是所有一切工业部门、运输部门，是全民的事情了。
