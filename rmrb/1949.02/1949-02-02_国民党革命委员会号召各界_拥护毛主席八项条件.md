　　Revolutionary Committee of the Kuomintang Calls on All Circles to
  　Support Chairman Mao's Eight Conditions
    [Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 29th] The Revolutionary Committee of the Chinese Kuomintang issued the following statement on the current situation on the 27th:
    In order to expose the peace offensive and international intervention conspiracy of the U.S. imperialist Nanjing Kuomintang reactionaries, we call on all sectors of workers, peasants, soldiers, merchants, and students across the country, and patriotic democratic elements within the party, to unanimously support Chairman Mao Zedong of the Chinese Communist Party's propositions on the current situation and the eight peace conditions. We hereby issue the following statement:
    I. The Chinese people demand the establishment of an independent, democratic, free, and happy New China. Imperialism, feudalism, and bureaucratic capitalism are the greatest obstacles to realizing independence, democracy, freedom, and happiness, and must be thoroughly eliminated before a truly people's democratic republic can be established. Therefore, we believe that the revolution must be carried through to the end and that we must not tolerate evil, lest we repeat the failures of the revolution since 1911.
    II. The Chinese people demand the realization of true and lasting peace. True and lasting peace can only be achieved in an environment of national independence, democracy, and freedom. Peace without complete independence and thorough democracy, and which contains the remaining forces of counter-revolution, is a disguised peace, an anti-democratic peace, and an incomplete peace. Therefore, we believe that complete independence and thorough democracy are prerequisites for the implementation of true and lasting peace in China. The implementation of the three goals of anti-imperialism, anti-feudalism, and anti-bureaucratic capitalism is the prerequisite for the realization of complete independence and thorough democracy.
    III. In order to implement the three goals of anti-imperialism, anti-feudalism, and anti-bureaucratic capitalism, and to clear the obstacles to the realization of the true and lasting democratic peace desired by the Chinese people, based on Sun Yat-sen's legacy of the Three People's Principles and the lessons of past revolutionary failures, we must have a basic understanding of the Chinese revolution: The Chinese revolution is a link in the international anti-fascist, anti-imperialist movement. The national democratic revolution in China takes the workers and peasants as its main force. Therefore, the revolutionary Three People's Principles must be the same in content as the New Democracy. The struggle against imperialism, feudalism, and bureaucratic capitalism must be carried out under the leadership of the Chinese proletariat party - the Chinese Communist Party - to ensure that it does not die halfway.
    IV. Recently, the Nanjing Kuomintang reactionary regime, under the crushing offensive of the People's Liberation Army, is on the verge of its final collapse. In order to maintain its privileges of enslaving the Chinese people, to preserve the reactionary forces in China, and to undermine the revolutionary forces, U.S. imperialism is about to come up with new political tricks. Its first trick is to attempt to organize so-called opposition factions within the revolutionary front; its second trick is to attempt to organize the remaining forces of the reactionary group to carry out the final struggle of the counter-revolution; and its third trick is to launch a counter-revolutionary peace offensive, attempting to carry out international intervention. These three political conspiracies are mutually reinforcing and cooperating. The factual manifestation of the first political conspiracy was Hoffman's statement in Shanghai last December. He said, "If 'free' elements and parties have widespread representation in the coalition government," "the United States may assist a coalition government including the Communist Party." The factual manifestation of the second political conspiracy is the much-touted joint defense movement of the five southwestern provinces by the U.S. imperialists some time ago, and the recent transfer of a large number of local military and political leaders in the provinces south of the Yangtze River before and after Chiang Kai-shek's resignation. The third political conspiracy is pre-determined in two steps: The first is that the number one war criminal Chiang Kai-shek himself comes forward to launch a peace offensive and launch international intervention; if it is ineffective, he retreats behind the scenes and changes to the number two war criminal Li Zongren to perform, still continuing to launch a peace offensive and promote international intervention. This year's New Year's Day, Chiang Kai-shek falsely claimed to maintain the pseudo-constitution, preserve the pseudo-legal system, and even preserve the counter-revolutionary armed forces and other "peace" conditions, and recently Li Zongren's circular telegram shouted such nonsense as "forbearing for the country," "saving the country and the people," and "preserving vitality," and designated a delegation to request peace talks with the CCP, putting on a full posture of deceiving the people, all of which are open performances of the counter-revolutionary conspiracy under the instigation of U.S. imperialism.
    V. In order to follow Mr. Sun Yat-sen's revolutionary Three People's Principles. In order to emulate Mr. Sun Yat-sen's revolutionary spirit of non-compromise, non-wavering, redoubled efforts, and fighting to the end, in order not to make the revolutionary cause, which is nearing final victory, fall short, we must inflict ruthless blows and expose the conspiracies of U.S. imperialism and its Nanjing Kuomintang reactionary faction to undermine the revolution. We firmly support Chairman Mao Zedong of the CCP's eight conditions for realizing true democratic peace in response to the Nanjing peace offensive conspiracy. We fully agree with Xinhua News Agency's view that Chiang Kai-shek's resignation and Li Zongren's rise to power are just Chiang's retreat behind the scenes and another form of peace offensive. We also fully agree with the opinions expressed by democratic figures across the country that "we believe that the revolution must be carried through to the end, and there is absolutely no possibility of reconciliation between revolution and counter-revolution," and that "we in the people's democratic front must raise our vigilance, rectify our ranks, unify our steps, and consolidate our unity to prevent the intrusion of counter-revolutionary forces, so that there is no room for opposition in the people's democratic front, nor is there room for the existence of a middle road."

### 国民党革命委员会号召各界　拥护毛主席八项条件

　　国民党革命委员会号召各界
  　拥护毛主席八项条件
    【新华社陕北二十九日电】中国国民党革命委员会于二十七日发表对于时局声明如下：
    我们为揭发美帝国主义南京国民党反动派的和平攻势与国际干涉阴谋，号召全国工、农、兵、商、学各界，号召党内爱国民主分子，一致拥护中国共产党主席毛泽东先生对于时局之主张及八项和平条件，特发表声明如次：
    一、中国人民要求建立独立、民主、自由、幸福之新中国。而帝国主义、封建主义和官僚资本主义为实现独立民主自由幸福之最大障碍，必须予以彻底清除，而后真正的人民民主共和国乃能建立。因之，我们认为：革命必须进行到底，不可姑息养奸，致重蹈辛亥以来革命失败之覆辙。
    二、中国人民要求实现真正的永久的和平。而真正的永久的和平只有在民族独立民主自由的环境下始能获得。没有完全独立与彻底民主，而又包容有反革命残余势力的和平，是伪装的和平，反民主的和平，不彻底的和平。因之，我们认为：完全独立与彻底民主是中国真正永久和平实行的先决条件。而反帝、反封建、反官僚资本三项目标的贯彻，又是完全独立与彻底民主实现的前提。
    三、为了贯彻反帝、反封建、反官僚资本的三项目标，扫清中国人民所要求的真正永久的民主和平实现之障碍，我们本于孙中山先生三大政策之遗教，和过去历次革命失败之教训，对于中国革命又必须有一个基本认识，便是：中国革命为国际反法西斯主义、反帝国主义运动之一环。而中国的民族民主革命又以工农大众为主力。因之，革命的三民主义必定是与新民主主义同其内容。而反帝、反封建、反官僚资本斗争的进行，又必须在中国的无产阶级政党——中国共产党领导之下，才有不再中途夭折的保证。
    四、最近南京国民党反动政权，在人民解放军的破竹攻势之下，已濒于最后崩溃的命运。美帝国主义为维持其奴役中国人民特权，为保存中国反动势力和破坏革命势力，又要出新的政治阴谋花样来了。它的第一套把戏是企图在革命阵线内组织所谓反对派；第二套把戏是企图组织反动集团残余势力，进行反革命的最后挣扎；第三套把戏是发动反革命的和平攻势，企图进行国际干涉。而这三套政治阴谋，又是互为呼应，互相配合的。第一套政治阴谋的事实表现，是去年十二月霍夫曼在上海发表的声明。他说：“如果‘自由’分子和党派在联合政府中有普遍的代表”，“美国可能援助包括共产党在内的联合政府”。第二套政治阴谋的事实表现，是前些时美帝大吹大擂的西南五省联防运动，和最近蒋介石下野前后的江南各省大批地方军政首脑的调动。第三套政治阴谋，更预定着两个步骤：开始是头号战犯蒋介石自己出面来发动和平攻势，和发动国际干涉；倘使没有效果，便退居幕后，改由第二号战犯李宗仁出场表演，仍是继续发动和平攻势和运动国际干涉。今年元旦，蒋介石妄言维持伪宪法、保存伪法统，甚至还要保存反革命武装等“和平”条件的提出、和最近李宗仁通电高喊什么“相忍为国”，什么“救国救民”，什么“保存元气”一类的鬼话，并派定代表团要求与中共进行和谈，装出了十足的欺骗人民的姿势，都是在美帝指使之下的反革命阴谋的公开表演。
    五、我们为了遵行中山先生的革命三民主义之遗教。为了效法中山先生的不妥协、不动摇、再接再厉、奋斗到底之革命精神，为了不使已近最后胜利的革命事业功亏一篑，我们对于美帝国主义及其卵翼下的南京国民党反动派的破坏革命之阴谋，不能不加以无情的打击和揭露。我们坚决拥护中共主席毛泽东先生针对着南京和平攻势阴谋而提出之实现真正的民主和平的八项条件，我们完全同意新华社对于蒋介石下野李宗仁上台，只是蒋犯退居幕后另换一种姿势的和平攻势的看法。我们又完全同意全国民主人士所发表的“我们认为革命必须贯彻到底，革命与反革命之间绝无调和之可能”，与“我们人民民主阵线内必须提高我们的警觉，整肃我们的阵容，齐一我们的步伐，巩固我们的团结，以防止反革命势力的侵入，务使人民民主阵线内决无反对派立足之余地，亦不容许有中间路线的存在”之主张。
