Xinhua News Agency, Xing County, 14th -- The 13,000 new recruits mobilized in 23 counties in northwestern Shanxi last summer and autumn have gone to the front lines to join the People's Liberation Army. The quality of these new recruits is very good. For example, in the semi-old liberated area of ​​Dai County, poor and lower-middle peasants account for 52%, middle peasants account for 45%, and young people aged 18 to 30 account for 74%. Very few new recruits deserted before or after enlisting. The achievement of this result is mainly due to the general improvement of the awareness of the broad masses of peasants and party member cadres after the land reform and the rectification of the Communist Party's rural organizations, as well as the encouragement of the victorious situation in the revolutionary war. However, the mobilization method played a major role in consolidating the work of the new recruits. There are several experiences in this military expansion work: (1) First, hold people's representative meetings in districts and villages to repeatedly explain and discuss the significance and specific methods of mobilizing participation in the People's Liberation Army, make realistic resolutions, and rely on the representative meetings to implement them in various villages. Then, conduct public propaganda and mobilization, mobilize the masses to sign up, and oppose "secret" operations and coercion. Wherever this was done, the work was done better and the task was completed quickly. (2) In a planned way, through the Communist Party's organization, mobilize party member cadres to take the lead in joining the army to influence the masses, which has achieved great results. The masses said: "Familiar cadres joining the army together can be taken care of." However, some counties and districts had too little planning for cadres to join the army, and too many people signed up voluntarily at once, and too many cadres left, which affected local work. As a result, cadres who had already signed up to join the army were left behind, which had a negative impact on the masses. (3) Combine the mobilization to join the People's Liberation Army with the work of giving preferential treatment to the families of revolutionary soldiers, and village cadres should hold forums for new recruits and family members of soldiers to review the work of giving preferential treatment to military families and reasonably solve the difficulties of military families in production. At the same time, appropriately solve the needs of new recruits for daily necessities such as shoes and socks. Mobilize the masses to voluntarily comfort and send off, and stabilize the mood of the new recruits. Furthermore, improve the daily organization of giving preferential treatment to military families and improve the work of giving preferential treatment to military families. (4) Establishing a review system jointly responsible by county and district and government cadres and military cadres can ensure the satisfactory completion of the number and quality of soldiers. Because the troops often indiscriminately wash new recruits when accepting them because they do not understand the situation of the new recruits, which leads to disputes between the troops' cadres and local cadres. With the participation of local cadres in the review, the review is easier to conduct because they are familiar with the situation. (5) Establish new recruit regiments for short-term training. Before centralization, there should be full preparation for supplies and cadres. Establish a new recruit family reception center, stipulate systems, and assign special personnel to be responsible for political work for the families of new recruits. After centralization, after review and formation, establish Communist Party branches and various company organizations to conduct education focusing on politics and supplemented by military technology and entertainment.

### 晋绥扩军经验好　新战士质量很高

　　晋绥扩军经验好
  　新战士质量很高
    【新华社兴县十四日电】山西西北部二十三县在去年夏秋动员的新战士一万三千人已开赴前线参加人民解放军。这些新战士质量都很好，如半老区代县的新战士，贫雇农占百分之五十二，中农占百分之四十五、十八岁到三十岁的青年占百分之七十四。新战士入伍前后逃亡者极少。这种成绩的获得，主要是由于经过土地改革与共产党农村组织的整顿后，广大农民与党员干部的觉悟普遍提高，与革命战争胜利形势鼓舞的结果。但动员方式在巩固新战士的工作作得较好，也起了重大作用。这次扩军工作有这样几点经验：（一）先开好区村人民代表会议，反复说明并讨论动员参加人民解放军的意义和具体作法，作出切合实际的决议，依靠代表会议贯彻到各村去。然后进行公开的宣传动员，发动群众报名，反对“秘密”进行和强迫命令。凡是这样做了的，工作就做得较好，任务完成得迅速。（二）有计划地经过共产党的组织，动员党员干部带头参军，影响群众，收到很大成效。群众说：“熟悉的干部一同参军，可以得到照顾。”但有些县区对干部参军太无计划，一下自动报名过多，干部走得太多，影响地方工作，结果又将已经报名参军的干部留下，给群众造成了不良影响。（三）动员参加解放军与优待革命军人家属工作结合进行，由村干部召开新战士及军人家属座谈会，检讨优待军属工作，合理解决军属生产困难。同时适当解决新战士鞋袜等日用品的需要。发动群众自愿慰劳欢送，稳定新战士情绪。进而健全优待军属的日常组织，改进优待军属工作。（四）建立县区及政权干部与军人干部共同负责的审查制度，可以保证兵员数目与质量圆满完成。因为部队在接受新战士时往往因不了解新战士情况而滥加洗刷，以致部队干部与地方干部发生争执。有地方干部参加审查，因为熟悉情况，审查就容易进行。（五）成立新兵团进行短期训练。在集中前，关于给养和干部都应有充分的准备。成立新兵家属招待处，规定制度，指定专人负责对新战士家属进行政治工作。集中后，经过审查编队，建立共产党的支部及各种连队组织，进行以政治为主，军事技术、文娱为辅的教育。
