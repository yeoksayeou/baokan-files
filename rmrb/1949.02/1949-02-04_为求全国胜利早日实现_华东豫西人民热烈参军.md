　　To Achieve National Victory Sooner
  　East China and Western Henan People Enthusiastically Join the Army
    Xinhua News Agency, East China, 28th: Encouraged by the great victory on the Huaihai Front, the laboring people in the East China Liberated Areas are enthusiastically joining the People's Liberation Army. In the central and southern Shandong areas, the number of people joining the People's Liberation Army from the start of the Huaihai Campaign to the present has reached 20,000. In Jiangsu Province, over 3,200 farmers from counties such as Nantong, Rugao, Haimen, Qidong, Taixing, and Jingjiang have recently joined the army. All of these areas have suffered severe devastation from the Kuomintang bandit troops, especially those counties on the north bank of the Yangtze River in Jiangsu Province, making the laboring people particularly eager to join the People's Liberation Army. Many moving scenes constantly emerge during the conscription movement. Zhang Changshu, a farmer from Xinjian Township, Nantong, Jiangsu Province, loudly accused at a meeting: "I was captured by the enemy (referring to the Kuomintang bandit troops), tortured and interrogated, and fainted five times. The enemy burned me with thatch and scraped me with shrapnel. When I escaped and took off my jacket, the flesh and blood were stuck to it. If I don't join the People's Liberation Army now, when will I avenge this!" Moved by his words, forty young farmers from Eryao Township eagerly signed up to join the army on the spot. Subsequently, parents sent their sons, wives sent their husbands, and a total of 788 people joined the army. Zhao Songdou, a farmer from Jingzhi Town, Huai'an County (newly established county in northeastern Anqiu), central Shandong, pointed to his crippled leg at a farewell meeting for new recruits and instructed his son: "My leg was crippled by the Kuomintang army. You must work hard on the front line and avenge me!" In Henan District, Yinan County (southern Yishui, newly established county), Shandong, a farmer led his two sons to the district government to sign up for the army. He said to the district chief: "The Kuomintang army made us suffer so much the year before last, robbing us of all our grain. Fortunately, the Communist Party helped us with production and disaster relief, so we didn't starve to death." Communist Party members, cadres, and demobilized soldiers of the People's Liberation Army are also stepping forward to the front lines in the conscription movement. In Guangling District, Jingjiang, Jiangsu, 115 cadres responded to the call to join the army. Houhe District’s military section chief, who had been wounded once, swore before Chairman Mao's portrait: "I am a Communist Party member. This time, I will return to the front line and vow to eliminate the reactionaries!" On the spot, fifty-two cadres stood up together and swore to follow his example. Chai Fukun, a demobilized soldier from Tianbaozhai Village, Taining, central Shandong, voluntarily approached the village cadres and requested to rejoin the army, saying: "It was wrong to leave the People's Liberation Army in the past. This time, I am determined to rejoin the army." In addition, many demobilized soldiers submitted guarantees to the district and village governments: "We are determined to return to the front line to kill the enemy and perform meritorious service!"
    Xinhua News Agency, Central Plains, 28th: In order to achieve their own liberation and the early realization of national revolutionary victory, the people of western Henan are enthusiastically joining the People's Liberation Army. There are six districts in western Henan. According to incomplete statistics from only three of these districts, nearly 6,000 people have joined the Liberation Army from mid-October of last year to early January of this year. A large number of adults in other districts have also joined the Liberation Army. When the movement to join the People's Liberation Army began, some cadres in various places had insufficient understanding of the development of the revolutionary situation and underestimated the level of awareness of the laboring people. They believed that "the masses have not yet been mobilized, and it is not possible to carry out the work of mobilizing farmers to join the Liberation Army," thinking that mobilizing conscription would create social unrest. Therefore, they were hesitant in their work and did not dare to openly publicize to the laboring people. As a result, it aroused their unease, gave bad elements the opportunity to spread rumors, and made conscription work difficult to carry out. Later, after the leading organs in various places held cadre meetings to study and conduct ideological self-criticism, especially using the very favorable war situation and the vivid examples of laboring people in various places automatically requesting to join the army for education, the cadres realized that it was not that the laboring masses were not conscious, but that their own thinking was lagging behind the laboring masses. Afterwards, the leading organs and leaders of various counties and districts successively convened meetings of village cadres, activists, and laboring masses to explain the situation of revolutionary victory and openly carry out conscription mobilization, which immediately received an enthusiastic response from the laboring people, and the cadres took the lead in joining the army. Many village cadres in the first district of Xin'an County wrote letters to the district government requesting to join the army. After Zhang Xiaoyou, a district cadre in the district, took the lead in joining the army, a new recruit company was quickly established. More than 100 young people in the sixth district of Yiyang joined the army and joined the independent regiment. At the same time, having new recruits who had already joined the army mobilize others to join the army also proved to be very effective, because they had personal experience, understood the psychology of those being mobilized to join the army, and had a preliminary understanding of the situation in the army. Zhao Qixuan, a new soldier from Nanyang, mobilized 27 people to join the army on his own. Ma Hesheng, who had only enlisted in Yichuan County for two days, mobilized three people in two days, and these three people mobilized seven more people in seven days. In the movement of laboring people joining the Liberation Army in various places, the glorious deeds of parents sending their sons, wives sending their husbands, and the masses mobilizing each other are even more common.

　　为求全国胜利早日实现
  　华东豫西人民热烈参军
    【新华社华东二十八日电】华东解放区的劳动人民在淮海前线伟大胜利鼓舞之下热烈参加人民解放军。山东中南部地区人民参加人民解放军者，从淮海战役开始到现在，已达二万人；江苏省的南通、如皋、海门、启东、泰兴、靖江等县农民最近参军者达三千二百余人。上述这些地区都遭受到国民党匪军的严重的摧残，尤其是江苏省长江北岸那些县份，因此劳动人民参加人民解放军特别踊跃。许多感动人的场面在参军运动中不断涌现。江苏省南通新建乡农民张长书，在一次会上大声控诉说：“我曾被敌人（指国民党匪军）抓去，动刑逼供，晕过五次。我被敌人用茅草烧，弹片刮，逃回来脱下小褂子，血肉都贴在上面，现在我不参加人民解放军，这仇那时得报！”在他感动之下，当场有二窑乡四十个青年农民踊跃报名参军。接着父母送子、妻送夫，参军者达七百八十八名。鲁中南淮安县（安邱东北部新设县）景芝镇农民赵松斗，在欢送参军会上指着残废的腿叮嘱儿子说：“我的腿是国民党军队找残废的。你到前线去要好好干，给我报仇！”山东沂南县（沂水南部，新设县）河南区，一个农民带领两个儿子到区政府报名参军，他向区长说：“国民党军前年害得咱好苦，粮食都给抢光，幸亏共产党帮助生产救灾，才没有饿死。”中共党员、干部、和人民解放军离队战士也在参军运动中纷纷走上前线。江苏靖江广陵区有一百一十五个干部响应参军。侯河区曾带花（负伤）一次的军事股长在毛主席像前宣誓：“我是共产党员，这次重上前线，誓必消灭反动派！”当场五十二个干部一齐站起来宣誓向他看齐。鲁中南太宁天宝寨村离队战士柴富坤自动找村干部请求归队说：“过去离开人民解放军是错了，这次坚决归队去。”另有许多离队战士向区村政府提出保证：“决心重回前线杀敌立功！”
    【新华社中原廿八日电】豫西人民为求得自身解放与全国革命胜利的早日实现，踊跃地参加人民解放军。豫西共有六个分区，仅据其中三个分区不完全的统计，自去年十月中旬至今年一月初，参加解放军者即将近六千名。其他分区亦有大批壮年参加解放军。当参加人民解放军的运动开始时，各地曾有一部分干部对革命形势的发展认识不足，过低估计了劳动人民的觉悟程度，认为“群众尚未发动起来，不能进行发动农民参加解放军的工作”，以为动员参军，会造成社会不安。因此，在工作中小手小脚，不敢向劳动人民公开宣传。结果，反而引起他们的不安，使坏分子有了造谣机会，致使参军工作不易开展。后经各地领导机关召开干部会议研究，作了思想检查，特别以非常有利的战争形势及各地劳动人民自动要求参军的生动事例进行教育，干部才认识到不是劳动群众没有觉悟，而是自己的思想落后于劳动群众。以后各县、区的领导机关和领导人员就纷纷召集村干部、积极分子及劳动群众开会，讲述革命胜利形势，公开进行参军动员，立即得到劳动人民的热烈响应，干部更争先带头参军。新安县一区很多村干部写信给区政府要求参军，在该区区干部张小有带头参军后，很快就成立了一个新兵连。伊阳六区百余青年参军，加入了独立团。同时由已经参军的新战士来动员参军，收效也很大，因为他们有着亲身经验，既懂得被动员参军者的心理，又初步了解了部队里的情形。南阳新战士赵其轩一人动员了二十七人参军。宜川县入伍刚两天的马贺胜，二天动员了三人，这三人七天中又动员了七人。在各地劳动人民参加解放军的运动中，父母送儿子，妻子送丈夫及群众互相动员的光荣事迹，更屡见不鲜。
