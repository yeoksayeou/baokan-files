Jizhong Restores Over One Hundred Well-Drilling Teams
　　Boye and Other Places Convene Well Team Meetings to Summarize Experience
　　[Our News] In order to effectively lead and develop water conservancy work, the Jizhong Administrative Office sent cadres to five counties including Ding County, Anguo, Shenze, Wuji, and Boye in January to begin restoring and organizing well-drilling teams. Currently, one hundred and sixteen teams have been formed. During this period, a meeting of representatives from eleven well-drilling teams in Boye, Ding County, Anguo, and Shenze was also held to summarize the achievements and experiences of well-drilling last year. These eleven well-drilling teams, totaling eighty-one people, drilled a total of eighty-three wells last year (seventy-two wells with damaged pipes from cone drilling, and eleven new wells). Among them, Wang Dianchen's team from Anguo alone drilled twenty-five wells. These well-drilling teams have been praised by farmers in various places for their active and conscientious work. After Sun Zhixi's well-drilling team from Shenze completed a well in Cai Village, Renhebei, the well owner saw that the work was done very well and rewarded them with 4.5 million Border Region currency. Wang Dianchen's well-drilling team from Anguo also received a reward of 7 million yuan in Xizhanggezhuang, Renqiu. Zuo Tang's well-drilling team from Ding County completed three wells in nine days in Yudi Village, Boye, during the winter, and the farmers in the village praised them highly. Currently, three households have already prepared the materials and are ready to start work this spring.
　　During the exchange of experiences in cone well drilling, the following issues were raised: (1) In order to save raw materials, single pipes can be used, and it is best to use hanging pipes, which are more durable. (2) When encountering a sandy bottom, clay slurry or water pressure can be used. (3) Generally, horizontal water pipes are not durable. (4) The pipe plates should be thicker, and the iron wire should be thicker. This way, it is more durable. Thin plates and thin wires are most easily damaged.
　　After the meeting, the teams proposed that they must strengthen communication in the future, exchange well-drilling experience at any time, and improve their skills together. They also requested that the Second Water Conservancy Promotion Agency provide some tools and raw materials in a timely manner, in preparation for carrying out large-scale water conservancy projects.

　　冀中恢复百余打井班
  　博野等地召开井班会议总结经验
    【本报消息】冀中行署为了有力的领导开展水利工作，于一月份派出干部到定县、安国、深泽、无极、博野等五县着手恢复组织打井班，现已组成一百一十六班。在此期间还召开了博野、定县、安国、深泽四县十一个井班代表的会议，总结了去年打井的成绩和经验。这十一个打井班共八十一人，去年共打井八十三眼（锥坏井下管子的七十二眼，新井十一眼）。其中只安国王殿臣班就打了二十五眼。这些打井班由于做活积极认真，得到了各地农民的好评。深泽孙志喜打井班，在任河北蔡村打完井后，井主看到活做的很好，奖励边币（下同）四十五万元。安国王殿臣打井班在任邱西张各庄，也得奖款七十万元。定县左堂打井班冬季在博野淤堤村，九天完成三眼井，该村农民都很赞扬。当下就有三户准备好了原料定好准备今春开工。
    大伙在交流锥井经验中，提出了以下几个问题：（一）为了节省原料，可下单管，最好是下吊管，这样使用耐久。（二）遇到沙底时，可灌胶泥水或用水压。（三）一般的不用横水，因为横水不耐久。（四）管子板子要厚点，铁丝要粗点。这样还耐久。板薄丝细最容易坏。
    会后，各班互相提出今后一定加强联系，随时交流打井经验，以互相提高技术。并要求第二水利推进社及时供给些工具原料，准备大量开展水利事业。
