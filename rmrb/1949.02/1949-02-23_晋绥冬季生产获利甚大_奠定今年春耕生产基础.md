Xinhua News Agency, Xingxian, 21st -- The winter production carried out by farmers in various parts of the Jin-Sui liberated area is of great help to this year's spring planting. This is the result of the active leadership of local government cadres. Cadres in Guoxian, Daixian, Ningwu and other counties in northwestern Shanxi Province, taking advantage of the need to supply coal and oil to the Suiyuan and Mongolian new districts, organized farmers to mine coal and open oil presses. Now the number of coal kilns in the three counties has increased to 239, an increase of 72 over the past. The number of oil presses has increased to 190, an increase of 83 over the past. The output of oil and coal has stimulated the development of the transportation industry. On the main roads leading to Suiyuan and Mongolia, the transportation lines are endless. As of recently, the farmers in Ningwu County have gained a profit equivalent to about 6 million catties of millet. Shapodi Village in Linxian County is a poor mountain village. The village cadre Hu Chengcai and others took the lead in organizing 44 people to burn charcoal, earning more than 21,000 catties of rice in three months. Together with other production, the whole village earned more than 66,000 catties of rice, exceeding the village's public grain burden last year by more than one time. Cutting firewood and accumulating fertilizer in winter are also important preparations for spring planting. Farmers in the Fifth District of Linxian County cut 4.82 million catties of firewood, enough for spring use. Farmers in the Fourth District of Lishi County completed the plan to build 1,020 fertilizer kilns. In winter production, farmers generally adopted the form of mutual aid and cooperation to organize manpower and animal power. For example, more than 90% of the oil presses in Guoxian, Daixian, and Ningwu counties are jointly operated by farmers. However, local cadres still have the following shortcomings in production leadership that need to be overcome: (1) Thinking that farmers can produce by themselves and do not need leadership; (2) Only making general calls, not personally leading, or only formally giving farmers plans; (3) There is blindness in leadership, lack of planning and foresight, such as vigorously developing oil presses and competing to purchase oilseeds in Lishi, Fangshan and other counties, resulting in the phenomenon that oilseeds are more expensive than oil.

### 晋绥冬季生产获利甚大　奠定今年春耕生产基础

　　晋绥冬季生产获利甚大
  　奠定今年春耕生产基础
    【新华社兴县二十一日电】晋绥解放区各地农民进行的冬季生产，对于今年的春耕生产帮助很大。这是各地政府干部积极领导的结果。山西西北部崞县、代县、宁武等县干部，利用给绥远、蒙古新区供给煤和油的需要，组织农民挖煤炭、开油坊。现在三县的煤窑增至二百卅九座，比过去增加了七十二座。油坊增至一百九十座，比过去增加了八十三座。油、煤的输出刺激了运输业的发展，通往绥远、蒙古地区的大路上，运输的行列络绎不绝。截至最近止，宁武全县农民得利约折合小米六百万斤。临县沙坡底村是个贫苦山庄，该村干部胡成才等带头组织了四十四个人烧木炭，三个月挣米二万一千多斤，连同其他生产，全村共挣米六万六千多斤，超过了全村去年负担公粮一倍以上。冬季砍柴、积肥也是春耕的重要准备工作。临县五区农民砍柴达四百八十二万斤，足供春季烧用。离石县四区农民，完成了造肥一千零二十窑的计划。在冬季生产中，农民普遍地采用了变工合作的形式，把人力、畜力组织起来。如崞县、代县、宁武的油坊百分之九十以上是农民合股开办的。但是各地干部在生产领导上还有如下缺点需要克服：（一）认为农民自己会生产，不用领导；（二）只作普遍号召，不亲自领导，或只形式主义地给农民订计划；（三）领导上存在盲目性，缺乏计划和远见，如在离石、方山等县亟力发展油坊，争购油籽，结果形成油籽比油贵的现象。
