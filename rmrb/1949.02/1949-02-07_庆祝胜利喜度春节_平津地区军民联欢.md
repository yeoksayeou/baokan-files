　　Celebrating Victory and Welcoming the Spring Festival
  　Joint Celebration by the Military and Civilians in the Tianjin-Beijing Area
    [Xinhua News Agency, Beiping, 3rd] A certain unit of the People's Liberation Army in the Tianjin-Beijing area celebrated victory and welcomed the Spring Festival with the people with great enthusiasm. The heads of various military and political departments sent New Year's cards to the parents of the commanders and fighters, which were attached with family letters from the comrades and mailed to their homes. Heroic families all received congratulatory letters. All units took a three-day holiday starting from the lunar New Year's Eve to carry out cultural and recreational activities such as Yangko dance and drama performances. The soldiers composed many songs themselves, one of which goes: "Say happy, really happy, the people and soldiers in the liberated areas smile together. The two major corps fight side by side, and the bandit army in North China is swept away!" They also organized New Year's greeting teams to pay New Year's greetings to their leaders, also composing songs with lyrics such as: "The New Year is celebrated with gongs and drums, unified pace, bravely move forward!" On New Year's Eve, each company held a recollection party, recalling the victory of 1948 and the progress of each comrade, and encouraging each other to continue to advance and fight to the end. The drama troupes and propaganda teams all performed new programs. The Vanguard Drama Troupe is rushing to rehearse the large-scale Yangko dance "Carry the Revolution Through to the End." The propaganda team of a certain regiment made thirteen shadow play pictures and performed them in each battalion. Each unit held a dinner party and paid New Year's greetings to the families of revolutionary soldiers, inviting the families of soldiers to dinner. Some troops also pasted couplets and hung honorary plaques on the doors of the soldiers' families in the驻地, and held joint celebration parties with them. The sounds of revelry filled every village.
