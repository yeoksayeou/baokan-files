[Beiping Telegram] Rinderpest has broken out in the Duolun area of ​​Chahar Province, and a special envoy from the Agriculture, Forestry, and Water Conservancy Department of the Beiping Military Control Commission has rushed to provide emergency treatment. According to news from the Chahar Provincial Government, the rinderpest in the Duolun area has spread to the Guyuan area, and more than 4,000 head of cattle have died. The Agriculture, Forestry, and Water Conservancy Department of the Beiping Military Control Commission's Materials Reception Committee immediately dispatched rescue teams in two batches on the 16th and 20th. The rescue team included Zhang Jishu, Ji Xilin, Su Lin, Bai Shaokang and other ten people, who were originally technicians and technical assistants from the North China Plague Prevention Office of the Kuomintang Ministry of Agriculture and Forestry. After the liberation of Beiping, they actively participated in production and construction.

[Zhangjiakou Telegram] The rinderpest areas in the northern Chahar and Hebei-Chahar Second Military Districts have been declared under martial law. After the two medical teams from the provincial government arrived, they immediately began medical treatment from the periphery, gradually compressing inward. Rinderpest in the northern Chahar and Hebei-Chahar Second Military Districts continued to spread to Zhangbei, Chicheng, Kangbao and other counties by the 19th. In Chicheng, 181 dead cattle were found in 67 villages, and 149 were still sick. 100 have now been cured. In Zhangbei County, the disease spread from three villages to twenty-two villages in three or four days, with 69 dead cattle. In Kangbao, rinderpest was discovered in four villages on the 17th, and more than 20 cattle have died in the past two days. The epidemic area occupies approximately 1,100 li around five counties in northern Chahar, and the area of the Hebei-Chahar Second Military District is unknown. From the initial discovery to the present, according to incomplete statistics, the total number of cattle that have died in Duolun, Baoyuan, Zhangbei, Chongli, Kangbao, Sihai, Chicheng and seven other counties alone is no less than 5,000. Now the two district epidemic prevention committees have issued a notice to all counties to quickly organize epidemic prevention committees at the county, district, and village levels, strengthen intelligence, establish a cavalry communication organization, and dispatch a large number of cadres to designated concentration points to conduct inspections, isolation, and other work. It has also been determined that Baoyuan in the southwest will be the key point for blockade and martial law. The second team starts from Chicheng and advances towards Sihai. Inspection stations are set up at key transportation routes, martial law is declared, traffic is blocked, and the entry and exit of cattle and cattle market transactions are strictly prohibited. The provincial government's medical and epidemic prevention team follows the principle of prevention being more important than treatment, and carries out preventive inoculations in nearby areas, gradually expanding to the entire area. The Northern Chahar team began group injections on the 17th. The local masses are extremely grateful to the democratic government for urgently sending doctors for prevention and treatment, and for the hard work of the medical personnel. They actively assist the medical team in concentrating cattle for injections and isolating sick cattle. The medical staff are warmly supported by the broad masses in the villages, who have offered to let them eat and provide them with comforts, but all have been declined. In some districts the area is too large, and although medical personnel have been increased, there is still a phenomenon of being able to attend to one thing but not another. In order to quickly eliminate rinderpest, the leading organs of various counties and districts should urgently organize forces and mobilize local veterinarians to participate in treatment.

　　察北紧急扑灭牛瘟
    多伦等七县已死耕牛五千头
    省府两医疗大队正加紧治疗
    【北平电】察哈尔省多伦一带发生牛瘟，北平市军事管制委员会农林水利处特派员赶往急治。据察省府消息，多伦一带牛瘟已蔓延至沽源一带，病死的牛已达四千余头。北平市军管会物资接管委员会农林水利处，立即于十六日、二十日派出救治队分两批出发。参加救治队的有张计舒、冀锡林、苏麟、白绍康等十人，他们原是国民党农林部华北时疫防治处的技师、技佐，北平解放后即积极参加生产建设工作。
    【张垣电】察北、冀察两分区的牛瘟区已宣布戒严。省政府两个医疗大队赶到后，当即从外围着手医救，逐渐向里压缩。察北、冀察两分区牛瘟至十九日止，继续蔓延到张北、赤城、康保等县，赤城已在六十七村发现死牛一百八十一头，正病的尚有一百四十九头，现已治好一百头。张北县境在三、四日间，已由三个村蔓延到二十二个村，死牛六十九头。康保于十七日在四个村发现牛瘟，两天来死去廿多头。疫区已占有察北五个县周围约一千一百余里，冀察分区面积不详。从开始发见到现在，据不完全统计：仅多伦、宝源、张北、崇礼、康保、四海、赤城等七县病死耕牛总计已不下五千余头。现在两分区防疫委员会已通令各县迅速组织县、区、村各级防疫委员会，加强情报，建立骑兵通讯组织，并抽调大批干部到指定集中地点进行检查、隔离等工作，并确定西南面以宝源为封锁戒严重点。第二队以赤城为起点，向四海侧进。并在各交通要道设置检查站，宣布戒严，封锁交通，严禁牛只出入及牛市交易。省府医疫队本预防重于医疫的方针，在近的区点线展开预防注射，并逐渐扩展到面。察北队已于十七日分组进行注射。当地群众对民主政府紧急派来医生防治，与医疗人员的辛苦工作，极为感激，积极协助医疗组集中牛群，施行注射与隔离病牛。医务工作人员在各村受到广大群众热诚拥护，纷纷挽留他们吃饭，慰劳他们东西，但都被谢绝。有的区面积过大，现虽已增加医疗人员，但仍存在着顾此失彼的现象，为迅速扑灭牛瘟，各县区领导机关应紧急组织力量，动员各地兽医参加治疗。
