  　Timber is widely used
    Must cultivate more
    Tree roots network sediment
    Riverbeds will not increase

    Can avoid drought
    The country belongs to the people
    Everyone come to afforestation
    Spring plowing is approaching, and in a month it will be Qingming Festival. In order to encourage everyone to plant trees and afforest, we are reprinting this article by Mr. Zhou Jianren from the second issue of "China Youth" to draw the attention of cadres at all levels and the masses. —Editor
    　　　　　
    Scientists tell us that there used to be many forests on the ground. Primitive people didn't worry about the lack of trees, but only disliked too many trees—in primitive times, trees were not used much. If there were too many trees, it would be inconvenient to walk around, and it would be easy to hide harmful beasts or snakes. At this time, there were very high mountains, with forests growing on them. There were very deep rivers, and the river water must have been very clear.
    But as human beings evolved to a certain stage, the uses of trees became greater. Building houses, building ships, and making many tools all required wood. Wood was also often used as fuel, and consumed a lot. Therefore, after human beings evolved to the stage of large-scale use of wood, trees were gradually cut down, first the trees in convenient places, and then the trees in farther places and on higher mountains. Day after day, year after year, the trees gradually decreased. Houses were built, ships were built, cars were built, and all kinds of countless implements were made. As the population increased, the uses became greater and greater.
    From that time on, people only cut down trees and did not afforest or plant trees, so the trees would only decrease and not increase. Some people may ask: Don't trees bloom and bear fruit? Won't the seeds scattered on the ground sprout? Small trees will grow into big trees, so the trees should increase. Yes, small trees are growing. But trees grow very slowly, and people's needs are often very urgent. For example, when fuel is needed, small trees will be cut down. Sometimes, cattle and sheep walking by will break or bite off the small saplings. Therefore, relying on the natural growth of small trees to replenish them is really unreliable. As a result, the trees are still decreasing, decreasing, and will be reduced to a place of many miles and many mountains without a single tree.
    If there are too few trees, the materials for building houses and making implements will be less, and inconvenience is expected. But there are even greater harms behind!
    When there are trees on the mountains, the soil on the mountains is networked by tree roots, and there are small grasses growing on the ground. After the rain, the water is stored and will not flow down very quickly, but only slowly. And the water flowing down is clear, without mud and sand. The situation is different after the trees on the mountains are cut down. The tree roots die, and the soil becomes loose. After a heavy rain, the water flows down quickly, carrying a lot of mud and sand. The water mixed with mud and sand flows into the river. When the water flows slowly, the mud and sand sink to the bottom of the river. Year after year, as the accumulation of mud and sand at the bottom of the river increases, the river becomes shallower. When the river is shallow, it cannot store much water. Later, when there is more rain, the river cannot hold so much water, and it floods the banks, rising up. If this continues for a long time, the river channel will become shallower and shallower, and the riverbed will rise higher and higher, almost level with the banks. Many places in the north have become like this: some rivers have been dry for a long time, and later, due to cultivation and excavation, they have gradually merged with the land on the banks and cannot be distinguished. Some newly dried-up rivers still have clear boundaries. Some river channels still have old bridge piers and bridge foundations, which have only recently dried up, and the traces are very obvious.
    Recently, due to scientific progress, steel and concrete can be used to build houses, which can save a lot of wood. Fuel is used for coal, gas is used, and electricity can also be used to cook things, so the use of wood as fuel has also decreased. But many kinds of implements still need to be made of wood, and some new uses have been added in modern times, for example: the invention of trains has increased the use of sleepers under the rails.
    However, the importance of planting trees is not only in these aspects. Because wood is needed, trees must be planted. In order to increase the production of crops, it is even more important to plant trees. As mentioned earlier, if there are no trees on the mountains, the soil and sand on the mountains will flow down with the water and fill the river channel. The rocks exposed on the mountains are gradually broken into sand by the action of rain and freezing, and are subsequently washed down by the water, filling the river on one side, and lowering the mountains on the other side. Over time, high mountains become low mountains, or even lose their mountain shape, only resembling mounds of earth. If this continues for a long time, this place will become a desert. Scientists who study the causes of deserts tell us that deserts are actually created by humans, not naturally formed. Because people who study deserts have found traces of ancient civilizations in the deserts. It is believed that there were also forests and rivers in the desert areas earlier, but later, due to the cutting down of forests, the rivers were silted up and filled, and the rainfall gradually decreased (less forests, less rainfall), and they gradually became deserts. Therefore, planting trees is not only for the purpose of using wood, but more importantly, forests can regulate rainfall: all crops need water. If there is little rain and the land is dry, even if there is fertilizer, crops will not grow. In places with little rain and dry land, digging wells and opening rivers is a good way to supply water. But only forests can regulate rainfall. Because trees absorb water from the ground into their roots, transport it from the trunk, and then release water vapor from the leaves into the air. The water vapor rises slowly, and after a while, it will turn into rain and fall. Therefore, places with many forests also have more rainfall, and if there are fewer trees, the rain will also decrease. Since forests can regulate rainfall, they can prevent the ground from turning into a desert. According to researchers, in some places where rainfall is very low and about to turn into a desert, after planting large forests, the rainfall can increase a lot in just twenty years, making the land moist and suitable for planting. Twenty years, from a historical point of view, is a very short period of time, and even from the perspective of an individual's life span, the time is not long. It can be seen that transforming the climate is not a difficult and time-consuming task, and it is not difficult to succeed as long as we work hard.
    But planting trees also includes protecting trees: that is, preserving the planted trees. If they are planted without protection, young trees are prone to death or being destroyed by cattle and sheep, resulting in great losses. Because forests must grow very tall to have the function of regulating rainfall, and the function of young forests is not obvious, so they must be protected to make them grow very tall. Tall forests can not only increase rainfall, but also shelter from the wind. Some places often have strong winds. With forests, the wind can be blocked, avoiding damage such as blowing down crops.
    Also, where there are forests, birds will definitely come to nest. Most birds like to eat insects. Many kinds of insects like to eat the leaves or other parts of crops. If they proliferate, the harvest of crops will be reduced. If birds that like to eat insects live nearby, they will eat the pests, and the crops will be protected.
    When there are more forests and they grow larger, we can also plan which trees should be retained and which trees can be cut down, using the wood for construction and making various utensils, and replanting young trees in the empty spaces. In this way, the forests will not decrease, and there will be no shortage of wood. The wood of some trees can be used to make paper, and the seeds of some trees can be used to extract oil, which can be used as raw materials for manufacturing goods. Planting trees and afforestation can not only make the climate "favorable for wind and rain", increase agricultural products, but the forests themselves can also produce many things.
    Some scholars only know to say that people in the past only knew how to use wood, cutting down trees, and did not know how to plant trees and afforest; cutting down all the trees, causing the land to become barren. But the reasons are not explained in enough detail. In fact, it is the working people who cut down the trees, but it is not these people who use the wood. Huge, straight-stemmed wood is taken to build palaces, mansions, and tiered pavilions, and solid wood is taken to make exquisite utensils, etc. These buildings and utensils are for the enjoyment of princes, nobles, landlords, and wealthy people (due to the superstition of theocratic rule, the construction of temples, monasteries, etc. also requires a lot of wood): the working people have no share in using them. Even for fuel, poor people can only take some branches and grass stalks to burn, and logs are for wealthy people to burn, which is what is expected. Under such circumstances, the people have no time to think about or engage in planting trees and afforestation. Now the era of the liberation of the whole country of China is not far away, and the country belongs to the people themselves. Of course, we must work hard to rectify it quickly. Planting trees and afforestation is one of them. In ten or twenty years, lush green forests will grow on the land of China, increasing rainfall in places where water is scarce. With the improvement of varieties and the improvement of cultivation methods, the products will definitely increase greatly.

  　木材用途广大
    必须多多培植
    树根网络泥沙
    河床不致增高
  　森林调节雨量
    能够避免旱灾
    国家已属人民
    大家都来造林
    现在快到春耕，再过一月就是清明，为发动大家植树造林，特将“中国青年”第二期周建人先生所写此文转载于此，以引起各级干部及群众的重视。——编者
    　　　　　
    研究科学的人们告诉我们：地面上树林本来是很多的，原始人类不愁树木缺乏，只嫌树木太多——原始年代树木的用度不大，如果树林太多，太密，反而行走不便，而且容易藏匿要害人的兽类或蛇。这时候有很高的山，山上生着树林。有很深的河，河水一定很清的。
    但是人类进化到一定时期，对于树木的用途就大起来。造房子，造船，造许多器具都得用木材。燃料也常用木头，而且消费的很多。所以人类进化到要大量利用木材的时期以后，树木便渐渐被砍去，先把近便地方的树木砍去，后来去砍较远的地方，较高的山上的树木。这样一天一天的，一年又一年的过去，树木就渐渐少下去，造了房子，造了船，造了车，造了各种各样数不尽的许多用具。人口增多起来，用途也愈来愈大了。
    从那时候起，人们一味在砍树，却不去造林种树，所以树木只会少下去，不会多起来的。也许有人要问：树木不是会开花结子的吗？种子散落在地上，不是会抽芽的吗？小树会长成大树，树木应该会多起来的。是的，小树是在生出来的。但是树的长大很慢，人的需要往往很急，比方需要燃料的时候，便会把小树砍去。有时候因为牛羊走过，会把小小的树苗踏断，或者咬掉。所以依靠自然地生长小树来增补，实在靠不住的。结果树木还是少下去，少下去，会少到许多里大的地方，许多座山上，不见一株树木。
    树木太少了，造屋，造用具的材料少了，不方便是料想得到的。但是还有更大的害处在后面哩！
    山上有树木的时候，山上的泥土有树根网络着，地面又有小草生着，雨后，水份便被蓄积着，不会很急的流下，只能慢慢的流下。而且流下的水是清的，不会夹着泥土及沙粒。把山上的树木砍光后，情形就不同了。树根枯死了，泥土也松了。一次大雨之后，水便很快地流下，而且夹着很多的泥沙。夹泥沙的水流到河里，水流得缓了，泥沙便沉下河底，这样又一年年的过去，河底积贮泥沙既多，河便变浅。河浅了，水就积不多。以后遇下雨较多的时候，河里便不能容纳这许多水，就泛滥到岸上，涨起水来。如果一个时候不下雨，河水便干了。如果再这样长久下去，河道愈浅，河底愈高起来，会与岸差不多相平。北方许多地方便成了这样子：有些河很早便没有水，后来因耕种、开掘的关系，逐与岸上陆地打成一片，分不出来，有些新干涸的河，界址还很分明。有些河道还有旧桥桩桥脚存在，是近年才干涸掉的，形迹很明显。
    近来因为科学进步，可用钢骨水泥来造房子了，可以省却许多木料的用途。燃料用煤，用煤汽，还可用电煮东西，木材当燃料的用处也减少了。可是许多种用具仍须用木料来做，并且近代又增加了些新用途，例如：发明了火车，便增加了铁轨下面枕木的用度了。
    可是种树的重要性还不仅在这些上面。因为要用木材，固然须种树木，为了要使农作物增加生产，更要种树。前面已经说过，山上如没有树木，山上的泥土沙粒随水下流，能把河道填平。山上露出的岩石经过雨打，及冰冻的作用，渐渐破碎成沙，相继被水冲下，一面把河填平，一面山也低下去，久之，高山变成矮山，或竟不成山形，只象土堆，如再长久下去，这地方便会变成沙漠。研究沙漠的成因的科学家们告诉我们说：沙漠实际上是人类造成的，不是天然生成的。因为研究沙漠的人，曾查出沙漠上常有古代文明的遗迹。相信沙漠地区早先也有树林河道，后来因树林被斫伐掉，河道被淤塞填平，雨量逐渐减少（树林减少，雨量也减少），就渐渐变成了沙漠。因此种树不只是为了要用木材，更重要的是树林能够调节雨量的：一切农作物是必需水份的。雨水少，土地干了，就是有肥料，作物也长不起来。在雨水少土地干燥的地方，掘井、开河是一种供给水份的好方法。但是只有树林才能调节雨量。因为树木会把水份从地下吸收入根内，从干内运送上去，再从叶片把水蒸气发散出去，到空气里。水蒸气慢慢上升，过一个时候，会化成雨降下来。所以树林多的地方雨量也多，树木少了雨也会减少。树林既能调节雨量，因此它能防止地面化为沙漠。据研究的人说：有的地方雨量很少，将要变为沙漠时，一经种植广大的树林后，不过二十年光景，雨量就能增加很多，使土地湿润，适于种植了。二十年，从历史上看起来是一个很短的时期，便是从个人一生的寿命来看，时间也不算长。可见改造气候不是怎样艰难费时的工作，只要努力一下，是不难成功的。
    但是种树还包含保护树：即保存既种的树木。如果种了不加保护，幼树容易死亡，或被牛羊等弄掉，损失很大的。因为树林必须长得很高大，才有调节雨量的功用，幼小的树林功用不显，所以必须保护它使它长得很高大。高大的树林不但能增加雨量，还能遮风。有些地方时常刮风，有了树林，能把风挡住。可免把农作物吹倒等损害。
    还有，有树林的地方，必有鸟来做窠。鸟类中多数爱吃昆虫。许多种昆虫爱吃农作物的叶子或其他部分，它们一繁生起来，农作物的收成就要减少。如果近地住着爱吃昆虫的鸟，会把害虫吃掉，农作物便得到保护了。
    等到树林多了，长得大了，还可以有计划地拟定哪些树应当保留，哪些树可以斫去，把木材供建筑及制造各种器物之用，空处另种幼树补上。这样，树林不致减少下去，木料却不愁缺用。有些树的木材可以做纸，有些树的种子可以取油，作制造物品的原料。种树造林不但能使气候“风调雨顺”，能增加农产品，树林本身还能产出许多东西来呢。
    有些学者，单知道说：过去的人们只知利用木材，斫伐树木，不知种树、造林；把树木斫光了，致土地变成荒漠。但理由说得不够详细。实际上伐木的是劳苦的人们，用木料的却不是这些人们。巨大、茎直的木材拿去造宫殿、大厦及楼层亭阁，坚实的木材拿去做讲究的用具等等。这些建筑物及用具是供王公贵族、大地主、大富豪等享用的（因了神权的统治的迷信，建造庙宇、寺院等也要用去木材不少）：劳苦的人民却没有使用的份。就是供燃料用吧，贫苦的人民也只能取些树枝、草秆来燃烧，成段的木材是供阔人家烧的，这是料想得到的事情。在这种情形下面，人民无暇想到也无法从事种树与造林。现在中华全国人民解放的时期已不远，国家是人民自己的了，当然要努力赶快把她整顿起来的。种树造林便是其中的一件。十年、二十年后，中国的土地上将生长出茂盛青郁的树林来，使雨水缺乏的地方雨量增加，再加以品种的改良，与耕种方法的改进，产品一定能大大的增加。
