Xinhua News Agency, Shenyang, 18th. To improve the city's various construction works, the Fushun Military Control Commission convened a city-wide workers' representative meeting on January 31st to listen to workers' opinions. Attending the meeting were 121 representatives from 45 units, including public and private factories. Because the representatives were elected by the workers and had solicited opinions from the workers in their respective units before attending the meeting, the speeches at the meeting were extremely enthusiastic. The representatives put forward 180 suggestions regarding mine management, workers' lives and studies, and urban construction. The relevant responsible authorities responded separately, stating that they would implement what they could immediately, and would find ways to solve what could not be done at present. They also made necessary explanations and clarifications on some issues.

　　为改进各项建设工作
  　抚顺召开工人代表会议
    【新华社沈阳十八日电】抚顺市军事管制委员会为了改进该市的各项建设工作，特于一月三十一日召开全市工人代表会议，听取工人意见。出席会议者有包括公私营工厂共四十五个单位的代表一百二十一人。由于代表们都是由工人选举出来的，出席会议前又都分别征求了本单位工人的意见，因而会场发言极为热烈。对于矿厂管理、有关工人生活学习以及市政建设等问题，代表们提出的意见达一百八十件。当由有关主管机关分别答复，表示能办到的马上照办，现在还办不到的以后当设法解放，并对有些问题作必要的说明与解释。
