Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 29th:

    ▲ The Soviet magazine "New Times" reports that from May 1947 to March 1948, in less than a year, US exports (in terms of quantity) fell by 28.6 percent. The implementation of the Marshall Plan did not stop the downward trend of US exports. The following are statistics on the decline of US exports from March to September 1948: March - $1,141.1 million, April - $1,123 million, May - $1,103 million, June - $1,013 million, July - $1,022 million, August - $988.8 million, September - $926 million.

    ▲ The economic situation in the Netherlands continues to deteriorate. The movement of workers demanding wage increases has spread to many towns. The trade deficit indicates that imports are increasing continuously. In December 1948, the total value of Dutch imports reached 428.4 million guilders, while exports during the same period were only 268 million guilders. Last year, the Netherlands had huge military expenditures. It is estimated that the expenses of the Dutch Air Force in Indonesia alone amounted to $436 million, which is almost equal to the total amount of the Marshall Plan allocated to the Netherlands and the Dutch East Indies in the first year. Although the Netherlands has US "aid," it still feels a severe shortage of US dollars. In December last year, the Dutch bank was forced to sell gold worth 27 million guilders to obtain US dollars. Currently, the Dutch bank is selling another batch of its gold worth 37 million guilders to US banks.

    ▲ The economic crisis in Belgium is developing rapidly. In the past two weeks, the number of unemployed workers has suddenly increased from 230,000 to 300,000, while three and a half months ago it was only 125,000. Official figures show that prices have recently approached four times the pre-war level, while in November last year they were 315 percent. The Belgian Communist Party's newspaper, "Red Flag," stated that workers' wages by mid-month had lagged behind the cost of living by 30 percent. The Federation of Belgian Manufacturers issued a statement on the 18th, calling for a reduction of US imports by two-thirds.

    ▲ The Marshall Plan is having an increasingly miserable impact on the Austrian economy. According to Austrian newspapers, in 1948, the total output of Austria's main goods was only 60 percent of Austria's pre-war level. Automobile production has stopped entirely, and truck production has decreased by 70 to 75 percent. Austria's textile industry is also significantly below pre-war levels. Austria cannot utilize its own electricity and steel, iron, and aluminum resources to produce manufactured goods and vehicles that its neighbors greatly need, but is forced by the United States to sell raw materials and semi-finished products to Western countries at extremely low prices.

　　美欧经济简讯
    ▲苏联新时代杂志载称，自一九四七年五月至一九四八年三月，即在不到一年之间，美国输出（就数量而言）跌落了百分之二十八点六。马歇尔计划的实施，并未阻止美国输出下降的趋势，下面是一九四八年三月至九月美国输出下降的统计：三月——十一亿四千一百万美元，四月——十一亿二千三百万元，五月——十一亿零三百万元，六月——十亿一千三百万元，七月——十亿二千二百万元，八月——九亿八千八百万元，九月——九亿二千六百万元。
    ▲荷兰经济情势继续恶化。工人要求增加工资的运动已遍及很多城镇。对外贸易的差额表示入超正不断增加。一九四八年十二月份，荷兰输入总值达四亿二千八百四十万盾，同期的输出却仅有二亿六千八百万盾。去年，荷兰军费庞大，据估计，仅荷兰空军在印尼所开支的经费，即达四亿三千六百万美元，几等于马歇尔计划第一年拨给荷兰与荷印的全部费用。荷兰虽有美“援”，但仍感到美元的严重短缺。去年十二月份，荷兰银行被迫售出价值二千七百万盾的黄金以取得美元。目前，荷兰银行正在把它的另一批数达三千七百万盾的黄金出售给美国银行。
    ▲比利时经济危机正迅速发展中。在过去两星期内，工人失业人数已由二十三万人突增至三十万人，在三个半月以前仅为十二万五千人。官方数字显示，物价最近已接近战前的四倍，去年十一月份则为百分之三百一十五。比利时共产党机关报红旗报称：工人工资至本月中旬已落后于生活费用百分之三十。比利时制造家联合会十八日发表声明，呼吁美货输入必须减少三分之二。
    ▲马歇尔计划正使奥国经济产生愈来愈悲惨的影响。据奥报估计，在一九四八年，奥地利主要物品的生产总量仅为奥国战前水平的百分之六十。汽车生产已全部停止，运货车的生产已减少百分之七十至七十五。奥国纺织工业也相当大地低于战前水平。奥国不能利用它自己的电力与钢、铁、铝的资源，以生产其邻国所大大需要的制成品与车辆，却被美国强迫以极低价格将原料和半制成品卖给西方国家。
