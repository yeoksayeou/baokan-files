Xinhua News Agency, Shenyang, 17th—After successfully completing the 1948 gold mining plan, the three major gold mining areas in Northeast China are now working hard to complete this year's huge new production plan. This year, the total plan for the three major mining areas is to increase gold production by at least 22% compared to last year, and some mines have even automatically guaranteed a 50% increase in production. Currently, the three mining areas have a total of 12 large gold mining pits, 492 medium and small pits, 186 scattered gold mining pits, 25 large water channels (dug to drain water for gold panning), and 282 medium and small water channels. The larger mines are equipped with modern mechanical equipment such as electric motors, water pumps, and oil extraction machines. Last year, the three major mining areas underwent significant changes in business management, namely, the implementation of state-owned enterprise management to replace the past management form of exchanging materials for gold, and the elimination of the feudal super-exploitation system of the capitalist foremen, and the establishment of a new system of democratic gold mining teams. As a result, the production enthusiasm of the workers has been extremely high. Over the past year, the three major mining areas have established Party organizations as the core of leadership and have cultivated and promoted a group of new cadres. According to statistics from the mines, a total of 195 Party members have been developed, and 146 cadres at all levels, including branch bureau chiefs, section chiefs, division chiefs, mine directors, and gold mining station directors (36 of whom are gold mining workers), have been promoted. All of these are the reasons for the successful completion of last year's production plan. However, on the other hand, there are still many shortcomings in the three mines, especially the rather serious departmentalism among some leading comrades, and there are still scattered and disorganized phenomena in business management, resulting in some losses in work. These shortcomings have been criticized and corrected at a recent joint meeting of the heads of the various mining bureaus convened by the Northeast Gold Mine General Bureau.

　　胜利完成去年采金计划后
  　北满三大金矿加紧增产
    【新华社沈阳十七日电】北满三大金矿区胜利完成了一九四八年的采金计划后，现正开始为完成今年度巨大的新生产计划而努力。今年度该三大矿区总的计划至少要比去年增产黄金百分之二十二，有的矿并且自动保证增产百分之五十。现三个矿区共拥有大＠（采皙金的坑）十二孔，中、小＠四百九十二孔，散＠（分散设置的采金坑）一百八十六孔，大水道（是挖道放水以供淘沙金用的）廿五条，中小水道二百八十二条。其较大的矿＠中均有电动机、抽水机、采油机等现代化的机械设备。该三大矿区去年在经营管理方面有了很大的变革，即实行了国家企业经营，以代替过去的以物资收换黄金的管理形式，并消灭了财东把头班的封建超额剥削制度，建立了民主采金班的新制度，因之职工生产情绪异常高涨。一年来三大矿区已建立了作为领导核心的党的组织，培养与提拔了一批新干部。据各矿统计，共发展党员一百九十五人，提拔分局长、科长、股长、矿长、采金所长各级干部一百四十六人（其中有三十六人是采金工人）。所有这些都是使去年生产计划胜利完成的原因。但在另一方面，该三矿仍存在着不少缺点，特别是某些领导同志存在着相当严重的本位主义的思想，在经营管理上也还有分散零乱的现象，致使工作受到某些损失。这些缺点在最近东北金矿总局召开的各矿局长联席会议上，已作了批判与纠正。
