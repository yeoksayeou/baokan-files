How the Preliminary Party Rectification in Daliulin Village Was Conducted?
By our reporter Lu Hao

(I)
Editor's Note: The preliminary party rectification in Daliulin Village is a typical example of the early stage of party rectification in Hengshui County. It discovered and solved many problems within the party and between the party and the masses, purged bad elements, and consolidated the party, all of which are good. The village has now moved into a phase of combining the end of land reform with a continued in-depth party rectification, to ideologically elevate party members and transform the branch. This is a completely necessary and indispensable step. We hope that the Hengshui County Party Committee can provide continuous reports on the current state of the village's land reform conclusion and party rectification.
The Daliulin Village branch of Hengshui was established in 1938. In the first six years, there were thirteen party members (one landlord, three rich peasants, six middle peasants, three poor peasants). After the mass movement in 1944, the branch underwent a major expansion and now has thirty-two party members (one rich peasant, twenty-four middle peasants, seven poor peasants). Since the leadership of the branch was initially controlled by the rich peasant element Hu Yujiang, and in the past four years, the main leadership thinking of the entire village, headed by branch secretary Tian Dachun (middle peasant), has been unable to break away from Hu Yujiang's influence. Therefore, although the general branch members and the masses in the village have a good relationship, the branch leadership has been seriously protecting landlords and rich peasants, using coercion and commandism, and committing certain acts of corruption and waste, causing widespread dissatisfaction among the masses. On the surface, the party is united, but due to the above reasons, a large gap has formed between the branch leadership and the general party members.

From the overall work perspective, before 1945, the party's policies were basically resisted, distorted, or even not implemented by the village's landlord Wang Yingjie (who once served as village chief) and the rich peasant Hu Yujiang (who repeatedly served on the branch committee but was the real power holder). After the mass movement in 1945, a group of middle and poor peasant party members with better standpoints was added to the party. The party relied on their struggle to basically achieve tasks such as rent and interest reduction and land reform. However, due to the long-term lack of organizational and democratic life within the party, especially in the past two years when party members did not participate in any party meetings, everything was decided by a few people in the branch, and party members only did what they were told to do, and ignored everything else if they were not told. As a result, work was sluggish and morale was low.

(II)
When the work team arrived at the Daliulin Village branch to lead the party rectification, they first held a general meeting of party members to convey the direction and purpose of the party rectification. Since the branch had long lacked an atmosphere of criticism and self-criticism, the team especially addressed the concerns of party members regarding criticism based on the specific circumstances, and explained that those who did not adopt a welcoming and respectful attitude towards criticism, but retaliated or harbored resentment, would be subject to disciplinary action. The general party members had a good attitude after hearing this. For example, militia captain Fu Zhensheng said, "Let's talk, so we'll know who is good and who is bad." Women's group leader Fu Xiuchun said, "Let's sort it out, so everyone doesn't have to take the blame!" The work team then proposed "criticize yourself, examine others." They then held two days of group meetings, but because the branch itself had no habit of criticism in the past, those with fewer mistakes examined themselves and then felt they had nothing to say. Those with major mistakes, such as Hu Yujiang, didn't say a word, and no one could do anything. Although some opinions were raised, they were all superficial phenomena and could not go deeper. At that time, Ma Qingwu's group reflected that "the branch" (referring to the branch committee; this is common among rural party members) didn't speak, so no one could figure out what to examine, "I think it's time to lift the lid on the yam pot!" Liu Dayu said, "I confessed my mistakes, but no one made any comments." At this time, the party members' eyes were all on the "branch" and the leaders, to see if the "branch" was still of the same mind, and to see what the leaders' true colors were. The work team then shifted the focus of their work to examining the branch and the leadership, and started encouraging the branch committee members to first examine themselves. At the same time, they began to pay attention to cultivating active elements who had a correct attitude towards party rectification among the comrades who had made mistakes, those who were willing to examine their own mistakes, and those who were relatively bold in criticizing others, and encouraged them to launch ideological struggles against those who had made major mistakes but insisted on not examining themselves. On this basis, a branch meeting was held. Liu Dayu and others first examined their own mistakes, followed by Xing Wenjie's revelation of Hu Yujiang's attempt to have the militia kill Ma Xibin (a poor peasant) to avenge a personal grudge. Xing Wenjie and Hu Yujiang had been inseparable in the past few years, but later Wenjie saw Yujiang's viciousness and distanced himself. This time, he criticized Hu Yujiang as a first shot, partly because he realized that he had been deceived by Hu Yujiang in the past, and partly because he wanted to use this opportunity to clear himself. But Hu Yujiang played the rogue and said, "I have old and young at home, you have to speak with conscience, do we two have any mistakes!" At this time, Fu Zhensheng spoke up as a witness, saying, "You told me to hit him, and then you said I was useless." Party member Li Laizi also said, "You took away my gun because of this." But Hu Yujiang swore he would never admit it, and even got up to leave the meeting. Although the work team promptly and severely criticized him, and praised the party members who spoke up for their courage to criticize, Xing Wenjie took off his hat after the meeting and said, "My family's safety is not guaranteed, I can't live in Daliulin Village anymore." He later asked the work team, "Is it scary or not?" The budding sprout of criticism that had just grown in the branch was suppressed again. At this time, the party members' common concern was: they had said everything, but didn't know how to solve it, and they also saw Hu Yujiang's attitude. Some said, "The problem is exposed, but it only creates conflicts, what's the use of that?" Some said, "If you don't get rid of the root, who isn't afraid?" Many opinions said, "We're afraid that the work team will make a mess of things, and then leave." They couldn't see their own strength. The leadership then focused on conducting unity education, explaining that the struggle against erroneous ideas should not be seen as the affair of certain individuals, and that everyone should support each other for the sake of truth. And it clearly stated that it would adopt a firm and thorough attitude towards impurity within the party. Unity education and the leadership's more explicit attitude advanced the spirit of criticism within the branch a step further. For example, Ma Qingwu said, "The masses hate him, we have the people, what are we afraid of him?" Xing Wenjie also rushed to say, "The higher-ups are telling us to criticize bad party members!" From then on, the party members began to not simply rely on the work team. As the examination work progressed, the ideological struggle unfolded.

(III)
The Daliulin branch launched criticism and self-criticism starting from the examination of work, distinguishing between right and wrong, and examining ideology and standpoint in specific events. This was a practical class education for party members themselves. For example, in 1943, the village leadership, headed by Hu Yujiang, was mostly composed of landlords and rich peasants. At that time, in order to conduct a legal struggle, although they were taking on tasks for the enemy, they were distributing them according to the reasonable burden method stipulated by our government. At that time, the landlord-rich peasant village chiefs and cadres were complaining that they couldn't bear it, and they asked the district, and the district said that the burden could be slightly expanded, but Hu Yujiang and the landlord village chief Wang Yingjie completely overturned the reasonable burden, and Wenjie followed along. At this time, the rich were unwilling to pay, and the poor couldn't afford to pay, so they forced the poor masses to demolish houses and sell trees, and some were detained by the enemy in the sentry posts. Although the poor peasant Ershou led eighty or ninety people to oppose it at the time, it ultimately didn't work out. Speaking of this matter, someone asked, "At that time, the landlord was the village chief, if he wanted everyone to bear the burden, what should everyone have done?" Someone retorted, "If you don't aid the enemy, someone will object, because they're afraid the enemy will rob them." Others objected, saying, "The rich set up some traps to fool the people. Actually, the rich are afraid of being robbed, the poor only have broken cotton quilts, what are they afraid of?" Someone angrily questioned, "What is the reason for having the poor peasants cover up for the landlords and rich peasants?" Even now, Daliulin Village still retains one landlord household and six rich peasant households, and they still have relatively good land and considerable floating wealth. Someone asked Yujiang, "Why did you say Wang Yingjie was a middle peasant?" Someone shouted loudly, "What a steady landlord-rich peasant standpoint!" Yujiang lowered his head and said nothing. Wenjie said painfully, "I shouldn't have abandoned my standpoint and done things for the landlords and rich peasants."

In the examination of specific work, it became clear who had a good and who had a bad standpoint. After the May 4th Directive in 1946, there was struggle against landlords and rich peasants everywhere, but there was no movement in Daliulin Village. At that time, the "branch" consisted of Hu Yujiang, Xing Wenjie, and a few others. They discussed it and decided that all the wealthier households should take out two thousand catties of wheat, and that was it. When this matter was examined at the meeting, everyone believed that this was not doing things according to policy, those who should have been struggled against were not, and those who shouldn't have been were fined wheat. This matter was later overturned by Hu Lianming, Liu Dayu, and a few others. Everyone thought this overturning was correct, that this had a standpoint. Who had a better standpoint was also illustrated in the work of compensating middle peasants. In the winter of 1946, when the Kuomintang bandit army was attacking Daming, the district held a meeting to compensate middle peasants. On the way back to the village, the branch committee members discussed and decided that only three households needed to be compensated. But branch secretary Dachun wavered a bit, thinking that it would be better to return all the land! To avoid trouble when the "Central" army came, he asked Yujiang, and Yujiang said, "Returning it all will reduce resentment." As a result, the land of the landlords and rich peasants was also returned. Later, when the district found out, Dayu, Lianming, and others, presiding over the matter, took the land back from the landlords and rich peasants. Everyone said, "This is mainly because Hu Yujiang and Dachun didn't see the poor, and supported the rich."

In the examination work, the leadership consciously raised the issue to the level of class viewpoint. This was a process of elevation for party members. One party member said, "In the past, I clearly knew it was wrong, but I didn't dare to say it was wrong. It turns out that it was because I didn't understand my standpoint. Now I understand."

The criticism and self-criticism that began with the examination of work must highly value the role of active elements, and add the strength of the masses – allowing the masses to express their opinions to the fullest extent. This will make the ideological struggle more in-depth, and the party rectification work will be further advanced.

(IV)
The preliminary party rectification of the Daliulin branch involved mobilizing the masses and mobilizing party members simultaneously.

When the work team first arrived in the village, the attitude of the masses was very cold. The work team conducted individual visits, and some people replied, "We don't go out, we don't know about the village's public affairs." The poor peasant Ma Laosi was picking firewood, and when the comrades of the work team walked over, he hid to the south. When asked about the village's affairs, he said, "I don't know, you'll find out slowly." In particular, some who had been retaliated against were even more concerned. For example, Fu Renwang, when the cadres were washing their faces and wiping them black, he offered an opinion, and as a result, he was said to be a feudal group. Now he doesn't speak up. At the first mass meeting, out of the village's one thousand and three people, only sixty or seventy people came, and they were all listless.

Later, because the masses heard that the party had torn itself apart and launched criticism, they felt that their opinions were not isolated. On the other hand, at the second mass meeting, the branch was made public, the list of party members was announced, and branch committee members Xing Wenjie, Hu Jingxing, etc. spoke at the meeting, expressing their desire for the masses to help with the party rectification, and welcoming more opinions, promising no retaliation. If anyone retaliated, they would be subject to the discipline of the party and the masses. In this way, the masses were moved by the actual actions of the party members. For example, Fu Renwang said, "I never thought there would be a day when I would be asked to speak." After an afternoon and a night of deliberation, nineteen representatives (ten middle peasants and nine poor peasants) were elected to attend the branch meeting to participate in the party rectification.

When the mass representatives attended the first branch meeting, due to time constraints, only seven people spoke. Hu Jinghao (a poor peasant) talked about how Hu Yujiang forcibly occupied his three mu of wheat seedlings, and even threatened Jinghao, saying, "If you dare to touch them, I have a place to deal with you." This matter had been stuck for four years. Jinghao said, "If it weren't for the party rectification, I'm afraid I wouldn't have a place to speak." Fu Renwang said, "I said a few words to the households being struggled against, and the farmers' association said I was causing trouble, they took away several pieces of clothing stored by my sister-in-law when they dug air-raid shelters, and detained me. This was done by Dayu." Dayu said, "I did this, I did it wrong."

Then, on the second day, when the branch meeting was held, the masses saw that they could offer opinions, and more people spoke up. They also spoke enthusiastically, talking about how the village had asked for wheat from more than forty middle peasant households (the minimum was one hundred and twenty catties, and the maximum was three hundred and sixty catties) to buy guns and make adobe bricks, and how a hundred or two hundred people ate together, with the village cadres wasting more than ten thousand catties of wheat, and hiring people to make more than twenty thousand adobe bricks, but only two or three poor households built houses, and the rest was used chaotically. The masses spoke to their hearts' content, some asking, "Why can middle peasants in the east also use adobe bricks?" Some said, "Because there's a Hu Yujiang in the east." Some asked, "Why hasn't the eight hundred catties of rice that Hu Dashun was supposed to pay after being struggled against ever been taken?" This meeting consciously avoided the problem of the masses asking questions and other party members standing by. Party members expressed their attitudes, admitting their mistakes if they had made them, and explaining their opinions if they hadn't. For example, when Hu Jinghao's wheat was questioned, Fu Zhensheng said, "Hu Jinghao's wheat should be returned to him." This specifically integrated the opinions, emotions, and demands of the masses and party members, especially supporting the masses' courage to speak. Tian Yongde said to Hu Yujiang, "Chairman Mao gave us freedom and happiness, but you deprived us of our freedom and happiness." Old lady Wu Gengqiu said, "Tian Ziyuan forcibly redeemed my house, but now there's a way to deal with it." Her voice trembled, but her eyes showed extraordinary joy. The masses had both criticism and praise for the strengths and weaknesses of the party members. For example, one of the masses said to Liu Dayu, "The poor plant the land, and no one will remember you, but the Communist Party manages the household cleanly, but you managed it in a muddled way." This was a pertinent criticism of Dayu's somewhat corrupt behavior. People spoke to their hearts' content, without any concerns. One of the masses recalled the scene of his speech at the meeting and said, "At first I didn't dare to speak, but when I saw everyone else speaking, I was encouraged, and others brought me along."

(V)
When the criticism unfolded, and the masses had also fully expressed their opinions, and the preliminary party rectification was about to end, how to deal with the party members who had made mistakes (especially Hu Yujiang) became the most concerning issue for the masses and party members (especially the masses). Non-party masses who had directly suffered from Hu Yujiang's attacks, such as Gao Shuhua and Ma Xibin, in order to ensure that their opinions could be realized through the masses, said to the representatives, "Do you think Hu Yujiang will retaliate?" If someone answered him, "Let's discuss it!" he would further say, "Let's do whatever should be done." At first, they agreed to beat him up, but later they said, "He should be sentenced to twenty years in prison."

The county party committee decided to expel Hu Yujiang, who had made the most serious mistakes, from the party. When some of the mass representatives found out about this, they ran to the work team and said, "If you don't let the masses beat him up, this matter will be difficult to handle." The work team then went to the masses to gauge their thoughts, and intentionally asked everyone, "What should we do with Hu Yujiang?" Some of the masses said, "If he's sent to prison, he still has a wife and children." Others said, "Once he shows his bad side, everyone will know, what's there to be afraid of?" The masses' thoughts were truly mobilized, and opinions with retaliatory emotions could no longer control the masses. In fact, this was a very good education for these people. In addition to removing Hu Yujiang from the party, the other three branch committee members were also criticized. Dayu had already declared that he would return the excess fruit he had taken. The masses' evaluation of this result was, "This is a matter for all time." They said, "This will be passed down as an old saying, it will be passed down for many generations, this is more satisfying than beating him up." Only a very few of the masses who had suffered a lot from Hu Yujiang still expressed that they were not completely satisfied.

The branch election marked the end of the preliminary party rectification in Daliulin Village. This election was not only concerned by the party members, but also by the non-party masses who expressed their concern the day before during the deliberation. For example, one of the mass representatives ran to the work team and asked, "Is this branch election this time by election or by designation?" He said enthusiastically, "Elections are sure to elect good people." He was afraid that we would designate Tian Dachun as branch secretary again, and said, "Dachun is a good person, but he can't take on great responsibilities, his attitude is not clear." The election was conducted in a pleasant and unconcerned atmosphere, and as a result, Ma Qingwu and six others were elected. Ma Qingwu received thirty votes, while former branch secretary Tian Dachun received no votes. The concentration of votes showed the extremely high prestige of the new branch committee among the party members and masses. They had never been so happy and said, "The people that everyone had in mind were all elected." Some said, "From now on, our hearts will be the same."

To ask what changes the preliminary party rectification in Daliulin Village has brought to the party, party member Ma Gengxin said, "I joined the party in 1940, and I didn't know what I was supposed to do. Now I know that I have to offer opinions on the bad things, and I also have to say the good things. I know what I'm supposed to do. I don't need to be mobilized to carry a stretcher, I'll go myself." After the preliminary party rectification in the village ended, many outstanding elements among the masses asked to join the party. For example, Hu Jinghao, who had been attacked, found the work team to tell them why he wanted to join the Communist Party. He said, "The Communist Party is really good, we understand, it really does things for the people." The branch is currently considering the requests of twenty masses who have applied to join the party.

The preliminary party rectification of the Daliulin Village branch, due to the correct grasp of the direction of party rectification, relying on active elements, starting from the examination of work, launching criticism and self-criticism, and fully mobilizing the masses, has made the whole village look brand new. It has smoothly transitioned to ending land reform, and is further improving the awareness of party members and elevating the branch ideologically.

The preliminary party rectification in Daliulin Village has come to an end, but further efforts are needed in future party rectification to further consolidate the relationship between the party and the masses, and to continue to improve the level of awareness of party members. Currently, the village is carrying out land adjustment and is also continuing to combine it with party rectification.

　　大柳林村初步整党是怎样进行的？
    本报记者陆灏
　　（一）
    编者按：大柳林村初步整党是衡水县整党初期的一个典型例子。发现了与解决了党内以及党与群众中不少问题，清洗了坏分子，巩固了党，这都是好的。该村已转入结合结束土地改革继续深入整党，从思想上提高党员，改造支部，这是完全必要的不可少的一个步骤，希望衡水县委能将该村结束土改与整党进行的现状再作连续报导。
    衡水大柳林村支部，是一九三八年成立的，开头六年以内，有十三个党员（地主一、富农三、中农六、贫农三），到一九四四年以后的群众运动时，经过一次大发展，现有党员三十二人（富农一、中农二十四、贫农七）。由于开始扎根时，支部的领导权就被富农分子胡玉江所掌握，近四年以来，以支部书记田大春（中农）为首的全村的主要领导思想，又不能摆脱胡玉江的影响，因此，虽然一般支部党员和全村群众关系还好，但就支部领导上严重的包庇地主富农，强迫命令及某些贪污浪费的行为，造成群众普遍的不满。党内表面上是团结的，但由于上述原因，支部领导和一般党员因而也形成了很大的隔阂。
    从整个工作来看，一九四五年以前，党的政策基本上受到该村地主王英杰（曾任村长）和富农胡玉江（屡任支委，但却是全村大权的掌握者）的抵抗，歪曲甚至不予执行。至一九四五年群众运动后，党内增加了一批立场较好的中贫农党员，党依靠他们的斗争，基本上实现了减租减息、土地改革等任务。但由于党内长期的缺乏组织生活和民主生活，特别是近两年来党员没有参加什么党的会议，什么事情只是支部里几个人一咕叨，党员们只是叫做什么就做什么，不叫做就什么也不管，因此工作疲塌，情绪消沉。
　　（二）
    工作组到大柳林村支部领导整党，首先开了个党员大会，传达了整党的方针与目的，由于支部长期缺乏批评与自我批评的空气，因此，特别根据具体情况，解除党员对于批评的顾虑，并说明如对批评不是采取欢迎尊敬的态度，而报复或忌恨者，一定予以纪律处分。一般党员听了情绪是好的，如民兵队长傅振生说：“说说吧，这样就知道谁好谁坏了。”妇女组长傅秀春则说：“闹闹清吧，别叫大家背黑锅啦！”工作组随即提出“批评自己，检查别人。”接着开了两天小组会，但由于支部本身过去就没有批评的习惯，因而错误少的，检讨了自己以后，就觉得没有什么可说的了，错误大的如胡玉江等一声不啃，大家也没有办法，虽然提了些意见，但都是表面现象，无法深入下去。当时马清武那个组反映就说：“支部”（即指支部委员会，在农村党员中多如此称呼。）不说，谁也弄不清检查什么，我看山药熟了该掀锅啦！”刘大雨说：“我把我的错误坦白了，谁也不提意见。”这时党员的眼睛都看着“支部”和领导，看看“支部”是不是还一鼻子出气？看看领导到底是什么底子？工作组随即将工作中心转移到检查支部，领导上启发支部委员先自我检讨，同时开始注意在犯错误的同志中，培养对整党态度端正的积极分子，对自己错误愿作检讨，也比较敢于批评别人的同志，启发他们向错误既大且又坚持不自我检讨的开展思想斗争。在这个基础上开了个支部大会，刘大雨等首先检讨自己的错误，继之就是邢文杰揭露了胡玉江为报私仇打算让民兵打死马西斌（贫农）的事件。邢文杰和胡玉江在前几年，曾经是胳膊不离大腿，谁也离不了谁，后来因为文杰看到玉江毒辣就疏远了，这次他批评胡玉江打了头炮，一方面是他觉悟到了过去受了胡玉江的愚弄；另一方面也是钻个空子想洗白一下自己。但胡玉江却耍无赖的说：“家里有老有少，说话要凭良心，咱俩有错吗！”这时傅振生就发言作证人，他说：“是你让我打的，后来你还说我稀松呢。”党员李来子也说：“为了这事，你还下了我的枪。”但胡玉江赌咒坚决不承认，并且还拔起腿来打算离开会场，工作组虽然及时严厉的批评了他，表扬了发言的党员敢于批评的精神，但散会以后，邢文杰把帽子一摘说：“我一家大小不保险了，我不能再在大柳林村住下去了。”他事后问工作组：“可怕不可怕？”支部内刚刚生长起来的批评的萌芽，又被压制住了。这时党员们的共同顾虑是：把什么也说出来了，但不知怎样解决，又看到胡玉江这样的态度。有的说：“问题掀出来了，光制造些矛盾，这有什么用？”有的说：“除不了根，谁不害怕？”很多意见是说：“怕工作组弄个稀里糊涂，撩下就走了。”他们看不到自己的力量。领导上这时抓紧进行了团结的教育，说明对于错误的思想作斗争，不能看成是某人和某人的事，为了真理，大家要互相支持。并且明确表示，对于党内不纯，一定采取坚决彻底的态度，进行了团结教育和领导上更加明确的态度，使支部内开展批评的精神前进了一步。如马庆武说：“群众都恨他，咱们有老百姓，怕他干什么？”邢文杰也抢着说：“上级就是叫咱们向坏党员提意见呀！”从这以后，党员们才开始不单纯的依靠工作组，随着检查工作，思想斗争就展开了。
　　（三）
    大柳林支部展开批评与自我批评，是从检查工作开始的，从几件具体的事件中，来分清是非，检查思想和立场，这对于党员本身是个实际的阶级教育。如一九四三年时，以胡玉江为首的村的领导成份大部分是地主富农，当时为了进行合法斗争，虽然给敌人拿差，但是按着我们政府所规定的合理负担办法摊派，当时地主富农村长干部们嚷嚷受不了，问区里，区里说负担面可以稍许扩大些，但当时胡玉江和地主村长王英杰就全部推翻了合理负担，文杰也随跟着。这时候，富的不肯拿，穷的拿不起，于是逼的贫苦群众拆房卖树，有的就被敌人扣在岗楼上。虽然当时贫农二寿领着八九十人起来反对，但终于没有结果。说起这件事情有人就问：“当时地主当村长，想叫大家负担，大家应该怎么办”？有人反问：“不资敌有人反对，因为怕敌人抢。”别人反对说：“富人弄些圈套，愚昧老百姓，其实富人怕抢，穷人只有破棉套，怕什么？”有人就气愤的责问：“叫贫农掩护地主富农，这是什么道理？”大柳林村直到现在，还保留下来一户地主，六户富农，他们还有较好的土地和相当丰富的浮财，有人问玉江：“为什么说王英杰是中农？”有人高声叫“好稳的地主富农立场啊！”玉江低头不语，文杰很痛心的说：“我不应该丢掉立场，给地主富农办了事。”
    在检查具体工作中，党员的立场谁好，谁坏，就看得清清楚楚。一九四六年五四指示以后，到处斗争地主富农，但大柳林村却没有动静。那时“支部”是胡玉江、邢文杰这几个人，他们商量了一下，决定凡富裕些的，每户拿两千斤麦子，稀里糊涂的弄了一下就算了。会议上检讨这件事，大家认为这不是按着政策办事，该斗的没有斗，不该斗的罚了麦子。这事情后来是胡连明、刘大雨他们几个推翻的。大家又认为这推翻得对，这有立场。究竟谁的立场比较好，在补偿中农的工作中也说明了这一点。一九四六年冬天，国民党匪军正进攻到大名，区里开会补偿中农，回村的道上，支委们商量确定只补三户就可以了。但支书大春有点动摇，他想着还是全退吧！省得“中央”军来了麻烦，他问玉江，玉江说：“全退回去少点恶感”。结果把地主富农的地也给退回去了，后来区里知道了，大雨、连明他们主持着又将土地从地主富农手中要了回来，大家说：“这主要是胡玉江、大春他们没有看到穷人，给有钱的人撑了腰。”
    在检查工作中，领导上有意识的将问题提到阶级观点上来认识。这对于党员是个提高的过程，一个党员说：“过去明觉是个错，也不敢说这是错，原来是立场闹不清，现在明白了。”
    从检查工作开始展开的批评与自我批评，必须十分重视积极分子的作用，再加上群众的力量——尽情的让群众发表意见，这会使思想斗争更深入的展开，整党工作会因此向前推进一步。
　　（四）
    大柳林支部初步整党，发动群众与发动党员是同时并进的。
    工作组刚到村里，群众的态度非常冷淡，工作组进行个别访问，有的回答是：“咱不出门，不知村里的公事。”贫农马老四在拾柴火，工作组的同志走过去，他就躲到南边去，问他村里的事，他说：“我不知道，你们慢慢就知道了。”特别是有的受过报复的顾虑更大，如傅仁旺，干部洗脸擦黑的时候，他提了个意见，结果说他是封建集团，他现在也不发言。第一次开了个群众大会，全村一千零三口人，只到了六七十人，而且还都是无精打采的。
    后来群众由于一方面听到了党内已经撕破了脸，展开了批评，这也就使他们感到自己的意见并不孤立；另一方面，在第二次群众会上公开了支部，公布了党员的名单，支部委员邢文杰、胡景星等在会上讲话，表示要求群众帮助整党，并欢迎多提意见，决不报复，如谁报复，受到党和群众的纪律制裁。这样，群众被党员的实际行动所感动。如傅仁旺说：“我没有想到，有叫我说话的一天。”经过了一个下午和一个晚上的酝酿，十九位代表（中农十贫农九）就在此种情况下，被大家选出准备出席支部大会参加整党。
    群众代表参加第一次支部大会时，因时间所限，就有七个人发言。胡景灏（贫农）说了说胡玉江强霸他三亩麦苗的事儿，并且还威胁景灏说：“你敢动，我就有地方收拾你。”这时事情已经蹩了四年了，景灏说：“要不是整党，怕就没有我说话的地方了。”傅仁旺说：“我给被斗户说了几句话，农会说我捣乱，挖防空洞拿走了我大姨子存的几件衣裳，把我扣起来，这是大雨干的事。”大雨说：“这是我办的事，我办错了。”
    接着第二天，支部大会举行时，群众看着能提意见，发言的人就多起来了，他们也热烈的发言，说起过去村里因为买枪、打坯，要了四十多户中农的麦子（最少的一百廿斤，最多的三百六十斤），当时一二百人砌锅吃伙饭，村干们浪费了一万多斤麦子，雇人打了二万多坯，只有两三家贫苦户盖了房子，其他的乱七八糟用了。群众们尽情的发言，有的问：“为什么东头中农也可以用坯？”有的说：“因为东头有个胡玉江。”有的问：“为什么胡大顺被斗拿八百斤米，一直没有拿？”这个会上，有意识的避免了群众发问、其他党员旁观的毛病，党员表明了自己的态度，有错误的承认，没有错误的说明自己的意见。如追问胡景灏的麦子时，傅振生就说：“胡景灏的麦子，应该还给人家。”这就将群众与党员的意见与感情要求，具体的溶合在一起，特别是支持了群众讲话的勇气。田永德对胡玉江说：“毛主席给了我们的自由幸福，是你把我们的自由幸福剥夺了。”吴庚秋家的老大娘说：“田子元硬赎了我的房子，这回可有办法了。”她声音颤抖，但眉目之间，欣喜异常。群众对于党员的优缺点，是有批评也有表扬的，如一个群众对刘大雨说：“穷人种了地，谁也结记你，但共产党当家都是当清家，你是当了个混家。”这对于大雨有些贪污行为，是个中肯的批评。人们尽情的发言，毫无顾虑。一个群众事后回忆他在会上发言的情景说：“开头我不敢说，看着别人全说，我心里也鼓动，别人也把我带上来了。”

    当批评展开，群众也已充分的发表了意见，初步整党将告结束的时候，对于犯错误的党员如何处理（特别是对胡玉江），成为群众、党员最关心的问题（特别是群众）。直接受过胡玉江打击的非党群众，高数华、马西斌等人，为了求得自己的意见能通过群众来实现，他们就在代表们跟前说：“你们说胡玉江还会报复吗？”如有人答理他：“商量商量呗！”他就又进一步的说：“该怎么办就怎办吧。”开头他们赞成打他一顿，后来又说：他该判二十年徒刑。
    县委对于错误最严重的胡玉江决定开除他的党籍，这事给个别群众代表知道了，跑到工作组去说：“你们要不让群众打一打，这事不好办。”工作组随即到群众中去摸了摸思想，有意问大家：“把胡玉江怎么样？”群众有的说：“让他坐了牢，他还有老婆孩子呢。”有的还说：“他一冒坏气，谁也知道了，还怕什么？”群众思想得到了真正的发动，带有报复情绪的意见，就已经无法左右群众了，而实际对于这些人，却是很好的一个教育。除了将胡玉江清除出党，其他三个支委也受了批评，大雨则早已自己声明将多占果实退出，群众对于这样的处理结果的评价是：“这是万古千秋的事。”他们说：“这还不当古话往下传，多少辈子也传下去了，这比打还解气。”只有极个别的受过胡玉江很大苦处的群众，总还表示不够十分满足。
    支部选举，做了大柳林村初步整党的煞尾。这选举不但为党员所关心，在前一天酝酿时，非党群众也表示很惦记。如一个群众代表就跑来问工作组：“你们这次支部是选还是指定？”他热心的说：“选举准能选上好人。”他怕我们又指定田大春当支书，他说：“大春是好人，但他不能负大责任，他态度不明确。”选举是在愉快和毫无顾虑的情况下进行，结果是马庆武等七人当选，马庆武得了三十票，而前任支书田大春则一票也没有。票数的集中，表现了新的支委在党员群众中极高的威信，他们从来没有这样高兴的说：“大家捉摸的这几个人都当选了。”有的说：“以后心也一样了。”
    要问大柳林村的初步整党，对于党内起了些什么变化？党员马庚辛讲过这样的话：“我一九四零年入党，不知道是干什么的，现在知道坏的要提意见，好的也要说，我知道我是干什么的了，出担架不要动员我，我自己会去。”该村初步整党结束以后，群众中的优秀分子很多人要求入党，如受过打击的胡景灏找到工作组述说他为什么要参加共产党，他说：“共产党真好，咱明白了，真给老百姓办事情哩。”支部现正在考虑二十个群众申请入党的请求。
    大柳林村支部初步整党，由于正确的掌握了整党的方针，依靠了积极分子，从检查工作入手，展开了批评与自我批评，充分的发动了群众，以使全村面貌焕然一新。顺利地转入结束土地改革，并进一步从思想上提高党员觉悟，提高支部。
    大柳林村的初步整党虽已告一段落，但要使党群关系和党内进一步的密切团结，并使党员的觉悟程度继续提高，尚有待于以后整党中的努力，现该村在进行调剂土地，也正继续结合整党进行中。
