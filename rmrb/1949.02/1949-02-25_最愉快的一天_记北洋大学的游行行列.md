　　The Most Joyful Day
　　——A Record of the Beiyang University Parade
　　At five in the morning, when the stars and moon still filled the sky, Beiyang University's announcing gongs and drums were already sounding, followed by singing: "The gongs and drums sound, day is breaking, students quickly rise to celebrate the great liberation of Peiping and Tientsin!" Around six o'clock, the procession set off from Xigu. Large portraits of Chairman Mao and Commander-in-Chief Zhu, along with a series of colorful cartoons and five-pointed red stars, attracted the attention of onlookers along the way. In particular, two animated panel cartoons collectively created by third-year students of the Mechanical Engineering Department were warmly welcomed by the masses. Outside the Kuomintang assembly hall, an old man saw the people in the cartoon continuously chopping at Chiang Kai-shek's head with axes and couldn't help but pick up the stick in his hand and start hitting along with them. The line of people dressed as war criminals was spat upon by the audience everywhere: elementary school student Ye Chengcao saw the ugly image of Chen Changjie, who wore a sign around his neck saying "Arsonist of Civilian Houses," and stepped forward to hit him, shouting hoarsely, "He must be executed!" A school worker, Ma Baokui, enthusiastically danced in the Yangko team. When someone asked him why he was so happy, he said, "Haven't we been liberated? How can I not be happy?" More than fifty Beiyang professors, lecturers, teaching assistants, and staff members also participated in the parade. Hao Tongsheng, a professor in the Aeronautics Department, Ma Simeng, a sports professor Zhu Chunshi, a Chinese language professor Ma Ziqiang, lecturers Zhao Shuangqing, Huang Changling, and others rushed from twenty miles away to Xigu to participate. Some faculty and staff even volunteered to take turns with the students to hold up large banners and portraits. Professor Zhu Chunshi, while struggling to hold up a flag, said with a smile, "I am happy even if I am a little tired. This is the first time in my life that I have participated in this historically significant event." Professor Hao Tongsheng said, "Today is the most joyful day for me, because a new Tianjin has already begun to be built!" He Jiali, a teaching assistant in the Electrical Engineering Department, said, "In the past, faculty and staff never participated in parades, but today they all came like the students, because this is to celebrate our own liberation!" Zhao Shuangqing, a sports lecturer, pointed to the order of the entire parade and said, "The army is paving the way in the front, the workers are following closely to build, and the students are studying diligently." Qi Qingping's father, a sixty-five-year-old man with white hair, happily marched with his son, shouting slogans and running more than thirty miles. He said to others, "I don't feel tired at all, I'm so happy." Student Cao Xiuren said excitedly, "In the past, when we marched, we were always beaten to pieces, and even the common people did not dare to approach us. Today is different, we are cheering together with the citizens." Beiyang professors, staff, students, and school workers spent this entire day in excitement and joy.

　　最愉快的一天
    ——记北洋大学的游行行列
    侵晨五时，星月满天的时候，北洋大学报晓的锣鼓声已经响起来了，跟着便唱出：锣鼓响、天快亮，同学们赶快起来庆祝平津大解放。六时许，队伍从西沽出发。毛主席、朱总司令的巨幅画像，和一连串彩色漫画，彩红五角星等吸引了沿途观众的视线。其中尤以机械系三年级同学集体创作的两个活动板漫画，更受到群众热烈的欢迎。在民国会场外，一个老大爷看到漫画上人民拿着的斧头，不断的砍在蒋介石脑袋上的时候，也情不自禁的拿起手中的棍子去跟着打。化装战犯的行列到处遭到观众的唾弃：小学生叶成操看到了身挂“烧民房”罪牌的陈长捷的丑恶像时，上前动手要打，并连声嘶哑的喊：“一定要枪毙他。”校工马宝奎在秧歌队里起劲的扭着，有人问他为什么这样高兴，他说：“咱们不是翻身了吗？不乐怎么的？”北洋教授、讲师、助教及职员五十余人，亦参加了这游行的行列。航空系教授郝桐生、马思猛、体育教授朱淳实、国文教授马自强、讲师赵霜清、黄昌龄等从二十里外向西沽赶来参加。有些教职员更自动的和学生一同轮流撑大旗，举画像。朱淳实教授一边吃力的撑着旗，一边笑嘻嘻的说：“累一点儿我也高兴，这还是我有生以来第一次参加这具有历史意义的队伍中来。”郝桐生教授说：“今天是我最愉快的一天，因为新的天津，已经在开始建设！”电机系的助教贺家李说：“过去游行，教职员根本都不参加，可是今天都和学生一样的来了，因为这是庆祝咱们自己解放哩！”体育讲师赵霜清指着整个游行队伍的顺序说：“军队在前面开路，工人紧接着建设，学生在热心学习。”校工祁庆平的父亲已经是六十五岁的老人了，白发苍苍，却兴高彩烈地和他儿子在一同游行，他同样喊着口号，也跑了三十多里地。他向别人说：“我一点也不觉累，我太高兴了。”学生曹修仁激动的说：“过去我们游行，总是被打得七零八落，连老百姓也不敢接近我们，今天不同了，我们和市民一道欢呼。”北洋教授、职员、学生、校工，就这样的在兴奋、愉快中，渡过了这一整天。
