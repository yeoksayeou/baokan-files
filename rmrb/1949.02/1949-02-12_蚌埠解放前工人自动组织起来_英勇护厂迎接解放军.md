Xinhua News Agency, Bengbu, 10th. Before the liberation of Bengbu, workers from all walks of life spontaneously organized themselves, fought against enemy sabotage, heroically and cleverly protected materials and machinery, and enthusiastically welcomed the People's Liberation Army. Workers on Shengli Road, upon hearing that the enemy was about to retreat, organized a security team of more than 80 people, and automatically took up posts at public places such as the Workers' Hospital, the Second Anhui Agricultural Farm, and the Huai River Control Committee. As soon as the enemy began to retreat, worker Li Zhenyou led people to block the gates of the aforementioned institutions and guarded them with guns to prevent bandits from intruding, thus protecting a large number of machines, vehicles, and other materials. Workers at the New Electric Lamp Factory spontaneously organized a security team, patrolling day and night for three days. On the second day after the enemy fled, they were already working hard to repair and resume power supply as usual. At 7:00 AM on the 17th, the enemy planted a large amount of explosives between two water towers near Bengbu Railway Station, preparing to blow up the water towers and all houses within 300 meters. Li Guanglin, Guo Huaxian, and 14 other railway workers rushed forward to protest unanimously. Nearby workers and poor people immediately gathered more than 100 people, forcing the enemy battalion commander and others to give up due to overwhelming public anger, thus preserving the water towers and nearby houses. When the situation became tense, workers at the Xinfeng Flour Company organized a security team of more than 80 people and locked all the machine rooms, finally protecting the machinery and materials. When the enemy retreated late at night on the 19th, the workers at the Huai River Wharf immediately rose up to ferry and welcome the People's Liberation Army. Prior to this, the enemy had blockaded the Huai River for nearly two months, concentrating all the oars at the "He Xia Service Team" residence. At that time, more than 50 boatmen, in order to welcome and ferry the People's Liberation Army, under the leadership of boatman Zhou Mingcai, smashed down the wall of the enemy's "He Xia Service Team" building, seized the oars, and that night more than 200 river workers and poor people participated in the ferrying, enabling the People's Liberation Army to quickly and smoothly cross the Huai River.

　　蚌埠解放前工人自动组织起来
  　英勇护厂迎接解放军
    【新华社蚌埠十日电】蚌埠市解放前，各业工人纷纷自动组织起来，与敌人破坏行动作斗争，英勇机智地保护物资、机器，热烈迎接人民解放军。胜利路工人，一听说敌人要撤退，就组织了八十多人的纠察队，自动在工人医院、安徽第二农场、导淮委员会等公共场所站上岗。敌人刚开始撤退，工人李振友就带人将上述机关大门堵上，并带枪警戒，以阻散匪侵入，因此保护下了大量机器、汽车及其它资材。新电灯厂工人自动组织纠察队，三天中日夜站岗巡逻；当敌逃跑后第二日，他们即在努力抢修中照常送电。十七日上午七时，敌人在蚌埠车站附近之两个水塔间装了大批炸药，准备将水塔及其三百公尺以内之房屋全部炸毁，李广林、郭化先等十四个铁路工人首先冲上去一致抗议，附近工人及贫民立即聚集一百余人，迫使匪军营长等在众怒难犯的情况下无法下手，乃保全下了水塔和附近房屋。信丰面粉公司工人在情况紧张时，组织八十多人的纠察队，将所有的机器房全部锁上；终于保护下了机器资材。淮河码头的工人们在十九日深夜敌刚撤退时，立即起来摆渡迎接人民解放军。这以前敌人已封锁淮河近两个月，将船橹全部集中于匪“河下服务队”驻地，当时五十余船工为了迎渡解放军，遂在船工周明才领导下一轰而将敌“河下服务队”房子的围墙推倒，抢出橹来，当夜即有二百余河工及贫民参加摆渡，使人民解放军迅速而顺利地渡过了淮河。
