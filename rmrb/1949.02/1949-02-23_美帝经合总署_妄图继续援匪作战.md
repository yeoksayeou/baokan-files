Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 18th. The head of the China Branch of the U.S. Imperialist Economic Cooperation Administration, Lapham, left Shanghai for the United States on the 16th. According to the Kuomintang's Central News Agency, Lapham "will testify on the issue of future U.S. aid to China (referring to aid to the Kuomintang diehards) when the U.S. Congress convenes." Before returning to his country, Lapham flew from Shanghai to Guangzhou on the 9th to attend a joint meeting of the Kuomintang puppet government's Executive Yuan U.S. Aid Utilization Committee and the U.S. Economic Cooperation China Branch to discuss specific plans for the agency to continue aiding the remaining forces of the Kuomintang reactionaries. A group of traitorous leaders, including Sun Ke, the puppet Executive Yuan President, and Wu Tiecheng, the Vice President, attended the meeting. According to the Central News Agency, the joint meeting decided to "fully allocate funds to South China (including Taiwan)," and decided to "raise sufficient funds to continue the work of the Economic Cooperation Administration in China," "purchase 22,000 tons of rice from Siam and Burma for use in the food-rationing cities of China," and "assist Guangzhou in adding warehouses," etc. According to the Associated Press, "most of the 22,000 tons of rice" of U.S. aid to the Kuomintang "will be shipped to Guangzhou."
