　　Nantong Masses Repair Bridges and Build Roads
　　Welcoming the Southern Advance of the Army

    Xinhua News Agency, East China, 25th. Party and government organs in various parts of Northern Jiangsu are actively leading the people to repair roads and bridges to facilitate military transport. In Sanyu District, Nantong County, the masses began mobilizing on the 27th day of the twelfth lunar month to repair roads and build bridges to welcome the southern advance of the army. All major and minor roads in the district were repaired within one and a half days. Men and women, young and old, in Dongyu Township worked together, completing a project originally scheduled for two days in just half a day, and constructing five large bridges before the end of the year. Many farmers voluntarily donated timber, and thirteen blacksmith shops rushed to make iron nails. To ensure unobstructed military traffic during the flood season, the Commissioner's Office of the Sixth District (governing eight counties including Guanyun, Donghai, and Anyang) instructed each county to build bridges that must be one foot higher than the highest flood level and able to withstand the pressure of ten-wheeled trucks carrying 20,000 catties. The bridges must be completed before the summer flood season, and the roads must be completed before the spring plowing. The Commissioner's Office of the First District (governing six counties including Jingjiang, Taixing, Taizhou, Rugao, and Dongtai) along the Yangtze River also promulgated the Bridge Protection Regulations at the beginning of this month, ordering all counties under its jurisdiction to regularly and properly protect highways and bridges to avoid damage.

　　南通群众修桥筑路
  　迎接大军南下
    【新华社华东二十五日电】苏北各地党政机关正积极领导人民修筑道路桥梁，以利军运。南通县三余区群众在旧历十二月二十七日开始动员修路造桥，迎接大军南下，全区大小公路在一天半之内即全部修好。东余乡男女老少一齐动手，本来预定两天的工程在半天内就全部做好，并在年关前赶造成大桥五座。不少农民自动献出木料，十三家铁铺赶打铁钉。为保证复汛期间军事交通畅行无阻，六分区（辖灌云、东海、安阳等八县）专员公署责成各县修筑的桥梁，必须高出最高洪水水位一尺，能经得住十轮大卡车载重二万斤的压力。桥梁要在夏汛前完成。公路则须在春耕前完成。长江沿岸的一分区（辖靖江、泰兴、泰州、如皋、东台等六县）专员公署亦于本月初颁布护桥组织法，命令所辖各县经常妥切保护公路桥梁，避免损坏。
