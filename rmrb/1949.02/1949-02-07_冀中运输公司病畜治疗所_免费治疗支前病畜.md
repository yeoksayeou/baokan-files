【Jizhong Dispatch】 The Jizhong Transportation Company's Sick Animal Treatment Center, in the twenty-plus days since its establishment, has cured 371 sick animals for civilian laborers supporting the front. It has been warmly praised by the masses. The doctors at the center have no airs whatsoever, breaking the past restrictions on medical hours. Every day, they ride two bicycles, carrying medicines and equipment, with a flag reading "Free Treatment for Sick Animals," proactively seeking out sick animals to treat in the areas where carts are concentrated. This has solved many difficulties for civilian laborers with sick animals in finding doctors, maintaining the transportation strength supporting the front. The treating doctors are extremely active; even if civilian laborers bring livestock for treatment after midnight, they never refuse. One night, they got up four times after going to sleep to treat sick animals for civilian laborers, without a single complaint. They also often explain to the civilian laborers and urge them to take preventative measures against diseases. Wu Fang, a villager from Wunüdian, Anguo, said to the doctor who cured his animal: "You are really good, and you don't even charge money. I will support the front well to repay you."

  　免费治疗支前病畜
    【冀中电】冀中运输公司病畜治疗所建立以后二十多天，给支前民工治好病畜三百七十一头。获得群众热烈赞扬。该所医生没有一点架子，打破了过去医疗时间的拘束，每天骑着两辆车子，携带药品用具，插着“免费治疗病畜”的旗子，轮回大车集中的地方主动寻找病畜医治，解决了民工病畜寻找医生的许多困难，保持了支前的运输力量。治疗的医生，十分积极，夜间十二点以后，民工牵牲口前来治疗，他们也从来没有拒绝过。有一夜，他们睡后起来了四次，为民工病畜治疗，没有一句怨言。还常给民工们解释，叮嘱民工以预防疾病的方法。安国五女店村民吴方对给他治好牲口的医生说：“你们真好，又不要钱，我要好好支前，来报答你们。”
