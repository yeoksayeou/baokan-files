　　Xinhua News Agency, East China, 19th: Bengbu City, the first commercial port in Northern Anhui, is rapidly recovering since its liberation on January 20th. The fastest recovery is in public utilities. The old electric light plant resumed power supply on the evening of the liberation, and the new electric light plant also resumed power supply on the second day after the liberation with the active repair of workers. The telephone bureau and post office were immediately repaired and started working after liberation. Twenty-three employees of the telecommunications bureau voluntarily requested to join the communications team organized by the Public Utilities Department of the Military Control Commission to repair telephone lines. Now, the city's telephone lines and the long-distance telephone lines from Bengbu to Hefei and Linhuai Pass have been repaired and are in operation. The Huai River waterway, which had been suspended for three months due to the blockade by the Kuomintang bandit army, has also been restored. Fast boats between Bengbu and Huaiyuan resumed navigation on January 26th, with four daily round trips. The municipal government has established a shipping management section to actively organize the restoration of shipping. The first batch of more than forty ships has sailed eastward along the Huai River to Shuanggou to transport grain. Most of the city's 2,781 stores have resumed business. All the vendors have resumed business. Grain from the surrounding countryside is continuously entering the market. There were more than 300 salt merchants in the city, with an annual sales volume of 2.2 million tons of salt in the past. They were almost completely destroyed during the Kuomintang rule, but most have resumed business since liberation. There are a total of ten public and private middle schools and fifty-one public and private primary schools in the city. The public schools have been taken over by the Culture and Education Department of the Military Control Commission, and the private schools are being registered. The Culture and Education Department has successively held symposiums on culture and education and symposiums for faculty and staff of primary and secondary schools to clarify the People's Government's policies towards intellectuals. Now, all schools have posted notices of enrollment and registration, and classes will officially resume after the winter vacation. Amidst the rapid recovery of various industries, the preparatory committee of the Federation of Trade Unions of various industries was established on January 25th. The pseudo-Federation of Trade Unions, which was controlled by Kuomintang secret agents and labor scabs, has been dissolved by the People's Government at the request of the workers.

    【新华社华东十九日电】皖北第一商埠——蚌埠市，自上月二十日解放以来，正迅速恢复中。恢复得最快的是公用事业。老电灯厂在解放当晚即照常送电，新电灯厂在工人积极抢修下，解放后的第二天也恢复送电。电话局、邮局均在解放后立即修复，开始工作。电信局职工二十三人自动要求参加军事管制委员会公用事业部组织的通讯队，从事修理电话工作。现市内电话以及蚌市至合肥与临淮关等地的长途电话线均已修复通话。因国民党匪军封锁而停顿三个月的淮河水运，亦已恢复。蚌埠与怀远间的快船已于上月二十六日通航，每日对航四班。市政府设立了航舶管理科，积极组织恢复航运，第一批四十余只船已沿淮河东下，开往双沟运粮。全市二千七百八十一家商店已大部复业。摊贩已全部复业。四乡粮米陆续入市。全市原有盐商三百余家，过去年销盐二百二十万吨，在国民党统治时期，曾被摧残殆尽，解放以来又大部恢复营业。市内公私立中学共有十所，公私立小学共有五十一所，其中公立学校已由军管会文教部接收，私立学校均进行登记备案。文教部曾先后召开了文教座谈会和中小学教职员座谈会，阐明人民政府对知识分子的政策。现各校纷纷贴出开学和招收新生的通告，寒假期满后即正式复课。在各业迅速恢复中，各业职工联合会筹备委员会已于上月二十五日成立。为国民党特务和工贼所把持的伪总工会，已经工人要求而为人民政府予以解散。
