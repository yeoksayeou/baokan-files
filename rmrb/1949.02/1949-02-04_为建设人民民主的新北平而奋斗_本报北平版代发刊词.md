　　Strive to Build a New, People's Democratic Beiping
    ——This Newspaper's Beiping Edition Inaugural Editorial
    Beiping is liberated! Thanks to the correct leadership of the Chinese Communist Party, the support of people from all walks of life, the invincible power of the Northeast and North China People's Liberation Army, and the unwillingness of many patriotic officers and soldiers in the Kuomintang army to continue the counter-revolutionary civil war under Chiang Kai-shek's command, the People's Liberation Army surrounding Beiping finally secured the principle of accepting democratic reorganization of the Kuomintang troops trapped in Beiping, based on Chairman Mao Zedong's peaceful statement of January 14th. Thus, we liberated this historical city and its more than two million people from the bloody rule of the Kuomintang reactionaries through peaceful means. From now on, the dark age of Beiping, enslaved by imperialism, feudalism, and bureaucrat-capitalism, will be gone forever, and Beiping will forever belong to the people.
    This is an unprecedented revolution in the history of Beiping, completely different from previous dynastic changes. It differs from any power transfer or struggle within the reactionary ruling class. It is a revolution that fundamentally changes the political and social systems. First and foremost, it has destroyed the Kuomintang's reactionary rule and completely placed power in the hands of the people, thus resolving the fundamental problem of the revolution.
    Of course, the liberation of Beiping is only the first step. To build a new, people's democratic Beiping, we must continue to make tremendous efforts politically, economically, and culturally. China is still at war. The reactionary Nanjing Kuomintang government has not accepted the sincere expression of Chairman Mao's eight peace proposals, nor has it shown any indication of achieving comprehensive peace in the same manner as Beiping. The Chiang Kai-shek clique continues to rule the Nanjing government and is actively deploying defenses south of the Yangtze River, under the cover of the false peace schemes of figures like Li Zongren. Even in Beiping, the remaining forces of these reactionaries still exist in various forms. They are trying to preserve themselves, attempting to seize opportunities to sabotage the people's cause. Therefore, the people of Beiping, the sincere democrats of Beiping, must unite, maintain a clear head, prevent and eliminate the sabotage plots of counter-revolutionary elements, and cautiously and resolutely carry out reforms in all aspects step by step.
    Today's people's democratic revolution in China is a revolution led by the proletariat, involving the broad masses of the people, and opposing imperialism, feudalism, and bureaucrat-capitalism, which is also a new democratic revolution. The people participating in this revolution include workers, peasants, independent laborers, professionals, intellectuals, the national bourgeoisie, and enlightened gentry who have split from the landlord class. (Mao Zedong) This is the people's mass force of the Chinese People's Democratic Revolution. The enemies to be overthrown by this revolution are imperialism, feudalism, and bureaucrat-capitalism and their concentrated expression in the reactionary rule of the Kuomintang. The regime to be established by this revolution is a people's democratic dictatorship led by the proletariat, based on the worker-peasant alliance. This is the political direction for the people of the whole country, and also the political direction for all the people of Beiping. The people of Beiping, from today's overthrow of the old regime to the acquisition of the new regime, to fully and actively participating in and using this regime, still need time, they need time to mobilize the revolutionary enthusiasm of the masses and organize the masses themselves, so as to produce a large number of activists who are connected to the masses. And as long as the people's masses participate in and use this regime in an organized and disciplined, fully active manner, they will grasp the key to transforming the entire society.
    In history, Beiping has been a fortress and a den of iniquity ruled by counter-revolutionary forces such as feudal emperors, nobles, warlords, bureaucrats, imperialists, and bureaucrat-capitalists. These extravagant and dissolute counter-revolutionary elements colluded with each other, doing everything in their power to enslave and exploit the vast number of Chinese people. They deceived and misled the good people with reactionary and decadent culture, blocking the development of social productive forces and people's culture. But at the same time, Beiping, like other modern cities, contains the rich creativity of working people and revolutionary intellectuals, and contains progressive production organizations and cultural organizations. These rich creativities, these progressive organizations and their experiences, must be carefully protected and inherited. Beiping was the birthplace of the May Fourth Movement in 1919 and the center of the long-term revolutionary student movement since the May Fourth Movement. Around the February 7th Incident in 1923, it was also one of the centers of the Chinese working class's anti-imperialist and anti-feudal struggle, led by railway workers. The tradition of workers' revolutionary activities has continued to this day. The revolutionary people of Beiping have always maintained contact with the Chinese Communist Party. For the past ten years, Beiping has been in the long-term encirclement of the revolutionary countryside led by the Chinese Communist Party. In the past year, the Chinese Communist Party's policy of protecting and building cities has had a widespread impact on the people of Beiping. As the People's Liberation War is advancing rapidly towards its final victory nationwide, the counter-revolutionary forces have become extremely isolated and are rapidly collapsing throughout the country. The people of Beiping's confidence in the victory of the revolution is even more solidified. These are all favorable conditions for building a new Beiping.
    The new Beiping must develop various productions and a new culture that serves the people.
    Under the victory of the people's democratic revolution and the leadership of the people's democratic regime, we have ample conditions to develop Beiping's various productions and enable it to play its due role in the national economic construction undertaking. Under the guidance of Chairman Mao's policy of "developing production, prospering the economy, taking into account both public and private interests, and benefiting both labor and capital," we must not only develop state-owned enterprises that occupy a leading position in the national economy, but also protect and encourage the development of private industrial and commercial enterprises, as long as they are beneficial to the national livelihood and can serve the new democratic construction. At the same time, we must also develop various cooperatives step by step on the basis of private ownership and the voluntary participation of the masses, within the scope permitted by the current economic conditions. In this way, the urban people will have the opportunity to strive to supply the countryside with more industrial products in exchange for more food and raw materials, so as to facilitate the development of urban and rural production and the improvement of the lives of urban and rural people.
    Beiping is China's most famous cultural city. It has cultivated a large number of outstanding talents for the Chinese people. It now has a large number of industrial workers, young students, various intellectuals and staff, which is a valuable asset of the Chinese people. In the future, under the new democratic education policy, we should strengthen their education in revolutionary theory, revolutionary policies, work skills, and scientific knowledge, so as to cultivate a large number of cadres suitable for the needs of revolutionary development in military, political, economic and cultural work.
    Under the banner of the New Democratic Revolution led by the Chinese Communist Party and the Chinese people's leader Chairman Mao, we are overthrowing an old society and building a new society; we are overthrowing an old China and building a new China. We have overthrown an old Beiping and started to build a new Beiping. The eight-point covenant announced by General Lin Biao, commander of the Pingjin Front of the Chinese People's Liberation Army, and General Luo Ronghuan, political commissar, should be jointly observed by the government and the people, and should not be violated. The new Beiping, this glorious city of the people, now declares its great birth. We are willing to work with the more than two million people of Beiping, towards the direction indicated by Chairman Mao, to mobilize all our forces and strive together to build a new democratic Beiping.

　　为建设人民民主的新北平而奋斗
    ——本报北平版代发刊词
    北平解放了！由于中国共产党的正确领导，由于各界人民的支持，由于东北华北人民解放军无敌的威力，由于国民党军中很多爱国的官兵不愿意在蒋介石指挥下继续反革命的内战，包围北平的人民解放军，终于在中国共产党中央毛泽东主席一月十四日的和平声明的基础上争取了困守北平的国民党军队接受民主改编的原则。这样，我们就把这座历史名城和二百余万人民，用和平解决的方法从国民党反动派血腥的统治下解放了出来。从此帝国主义、封建主义和官僚资本主义奴役下的北平的黑暗时代就一去不复返了，北平永远成为人民的北平了。
    这在北平的历史上是一个空前的革命，它和过去历次的改朝换代是完全不同的，它不同于任何反动的统治阶级内部的政权转移和争夺，它乃是一个根本变更政治制度与社会制度的革命，首先是摧毁了国民党的反动统治，把政权完全拿到了人民手里，这样，就解决了革命的根本问题。
    当然，北平的解放现在还只是第一步。为了建设人民民主主义的新北平，我们还必须从政治上、经济上、文化上继续作极大的努力。中国还在战争中，南京国民党反动政府还没有接受毛主席八项和平主张的真诚表示，还没有按照北平的方法实现全面和平的表示。蒋介石集团继续统治着南京政府，并且在长江以南积极布防，而以李宗仁之流的假和平阴谋为掩护。就是在北平，这些反动分子的残余势力也还是以各种形式存在着，他们正在力图保存自己，力图乘间伺隙，对人民事业进行破坏活动。因此，北平的人民，北平的真诚民主分子，必须团结一致，保持清醒的头脑，制止和消灭反革命分子的破坏阴谋，谨慎而坚决地逐步展开各方面的改革工作。
    今天中国的人民民主革命，是无产阶级领导的、人民大众的、反对帝国主义、封建主义和官僚资本主义的革命，也就是新民主主义的革命。参加这个革命的人民，包括了工人、农民、独立劳动者、自由职业者、知识分子、自由资产阶级以及从地主阶级分裂出来的开明绅士。（毛泽东）这就是中国人民民主革命的人民大众的队伍。这个革命所要推翻的敌人，是帝国主义、封建主义和官僚资本主义及其集中表现的国民党反动统治。这个革命所要建立的政权，是以无产阶级为领导的、以工农联盟为主体的、人民民主专政的政权。这是全国人民的政治方向，也是全北平人民的政治方向。北平人民从今天的推翻旧政权而获得新政权，到充分地积极地参与和使用这个政权，还需要一个时间，需要一个发动群众革命积极性并使群众自己组织起来，以至产生大批联系群众的积极分子的时间。而只要人民群众有组织有纪律地充分积极地参与和使用这个政权，他们就掌握了改造整个社会的锁钥。
    北平在历史上，曾经是封建帝王、贵族、军阀、官僚、帝国主义者、官僚资本家等反革命势力统治的堡垒与罪恶的渊薮。这些骄奢淫佚的反革命分子曾经狼狈为奸，极尽其奴役榨取中国广大人民的能事，他们以反动腐朽的文化，欺骗与蒙蔽着善良的人民，阻塞着社会生产力和人民文化发展的道路，但同时，北平也和别的现代都市一样，蕴藏着劳动人民与革命知识分子们丰富的创造力，蕴藏着进步的生产组织和文化组织，对于这些丰富的创造力，这些进步的组织和它们的经验，必须谨慎地予以保护和继承。北平是一九一九年“五四”运动的策源地和“五四”以来长期革命学生运动的中心，在一九二三年“二七”事件前后它又是以铁路工人为首的中国工人阶级反帝反封建斗争的中心之一，工人的革命活动的传统至今不绝。北平的革命人民始终是保持着与中国共产党的联系。近十年来，北平一直是处在中国共产党所领导的革命乡村的长期包围之中。在过去一年内，中国共产党所执行的保护和建设城市的政策，在北平人民中已经发生普遍的影响。由于人民解放战争正在向着全国范围的最后胜利急进，反革命势力在全国范围内已经极端孤立并正在迅速崩溃，北平的人民对于革命胜利的信心也更加坚固。这些都是建设新北平的一些有利条件。
    新的北平必须发展各种生产和为人民服务的新文化。
    在人民民主革命的胜利和人民民主政权的领导下，我们有充分的条件，可以发展北平的各种生产，使之在国民经济建设事业中发挥其应有的作用。在毛主席所指示的“发展生产，繁荣经济，公私兼顾，劳资两利”的方针下，我们不但要发展在国民经济中居领导地位的公营企业，而且对于私人工商业，只要它是有利于国民生计，能够为新民主主义建设服务的，就要加以保护并鼓励其发展，同时还要有步骤地在现时经济条件许可的范围内，在私有制和群众自愿的基础上发展各种合作社。这样，城市人民就有可能争取以较多的工业品供给农村，以换取较多的食粮和原料，以利城乡生产的发展和城乡人民生活的改善。
    北平是中国最有名的文化都市，它曾经为中国人民培养了大批的优秀的人材，它现在拥有大批产业工人、青年学生、各种知识分子和职员，这是中国人民的宝贵财产。今后应该在新民主主义教育方针下，加强对于他们的革命理论的、革命政策的、工作业务的和科学知识的教育，以培养大批适合于革命发展需要的军事、政治、经济和文化工作的干部。
    在中国共产党、中国人民领袖毛主席所领导的新民主主义革命的旗帜下，我们正在推翻着一个旧社会，建设着一个新社会；正在推翻着一个旧中国，建设着一个新中国，我们已经推翻了一个旧北平，开始建设一个新北平。中国人民解放军平津前线司令员林彪将军政治委员罗荣桓将军所宣布的约法八章应为政府与人民所共同遵守，不得违背。新的北平，这一座光荣的人民的城市，现在宣告它的伟大的诞生，我们愿与北平二百余万人民在一起，向着毛主席所指示的方向，动员我们的一切力量，共同为建设新民主主义的北平而奋斗。
