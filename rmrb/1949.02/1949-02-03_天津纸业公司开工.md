Xinhua News Agency, Tianjin, 1st—The Tianjin Paper Company, which has been taken over by the Tianjin Military Control Commission, was protected by the heroic struggle of workers during the liberation of Tianjin. This company is the second largest paper manufacturing enterprise in the country, after the Taiwan and Andong paper mills, and has two factories under its jurisdiction. After the liberation of Tianjin on the 15th of last month, the workers of the Second Factory immediately repaired the machines, baked the frozen water pipes, and installed large water pumps. They officially resumed operations on the 16th. The workers of the First Factory are also stepping up the repair of machine parts, circuits, and generator equipment, and are actively preparing to resume work. In the month or so before the liberation of Tianjin, the workers of the First Factory carried out a heroic struggle to protect the factory. As early as the beginning of December last year, the workers spread 149 tons of sulfur from the warehouse on the ground, covered it with cement and earth powder, to prevent it from burning if hit by shells. On December 20, after a part of the 184th Division of the Kuomintang bandit army forcibly occupied the factory, the workers used sacks to cover the motors, generators, and other equipment, and strictly guarded the sulfur warehouse to prevent enemy sabotage. As a result, the Kuomintang bandit army only damaged the factory's No. 1 pump. On January 5, the area where the factory was located was liberated, and Chen Changjie, the bandit leader trapped in Tianjin, ordered to "level the paper mill." Over the course of ten days, more than a thousand shells were fired at the factory, causing five fires in the factory, all of which were bravely extinguished by the workers. After this, the factory's 297 employees remained at their posts day and night, persistently protecting the factory. When waste paper outside the No. 4 pump caught fire after being hit by a shell, workers Li Changhu and another worker immediately summoned other workers to take action, removing the burning windows, and cleverly using pulp to extinguish the flames. On the evening of the 6th, the roof of the machine room caught fire after being hit by a shell. Forty to fifty workers, regardless of the enemy's unceasing artillery fire, immediately went up to the roof to put out the fire. When the staircase of the pharmaceutical room caught fire, worker Liu Fangshan, together with four soldiers of the People's Liberation Army, first rescued a wounded person from the room, and then used the water stored in the No. 4 water pump to extinguish the fire. The factory has two cooking pots, each with a capacity of 30 tons. Fearing that the acid-resistant bricks inside the pots would be cracked by the cold, the workers climbed to the third floor every day under enemy shelling, sending two stoves of charcoal to the bottom of the pots, and finally preserving the two cooking pots intact.

　　天津纸业公司开工
    【新华社天津一日电】已为天津市军管会接管的天津纸业公司，是解放天津之战中，经过工人英勇斗争所保护下来的。该公司在全国是仅次于台湾与安东两大纸厂的造纸企业，共辖两个厂。上月十五日天津解放后，第二厂工人立即修整机器，烘烤结了冰的输水管，装置好大水泵（音蚌，抽水机），至十六日即正式开工。第一厂的工人，现亦正加紧修理机件、线路及发电机等设备，积极准备复工。在天津解放前的一个多月中，第一厂工人曾进行了英勇的护厂斗争。早在去年十二月初工人们就把仓库中的一百四十九吨硫磺铺在地上，上面盖上洋灰和土粉，以防中弹燃烧。十二月二十日，国民党匪军一八四师一部强占该厂后，工人们又用麻袋装了土，将马达、发电机等掩盖起来，并严密守护硫磺仓库，防敌破坏。结果国民党匪军只破坏了该厂的一号泵子。一月五日该厂所在地获得解放，困守天津的匪首陈长捷，竟下令“打平纸厂”，十天中，向该厂发炮千余发，引起该厂五次火灾，幸均为工人奋勇扑灭。此后日内该厂二百九十七名职工始终不离岗位，坚持地保护工厂。当四号打泵机外的废纸中弹起火时，工人李长笏等二人立刻召集其他工人一齐动手，拆下着火的窗户，又机智地用浆水扑灭了火焰。六日晚机器房顶中弹起火，四五十位工人不顾敌人的炮火尚未停息，立即上房灭火。制药室楼梯着火时，工人刘芳山协同解放军四个战士，先将室内一伤员抢救出险，然后又用四号水泵内存水将火扑灭。该厂有容量各三十吨的两口蒸煮锅，工人们惟恐锅内耐酸砖被冻裂，每日在敌炮弹轰击下，爬上三层楼，将两炉火炭送到锅底，终使两口蒸煮锅完好地保存下来。
