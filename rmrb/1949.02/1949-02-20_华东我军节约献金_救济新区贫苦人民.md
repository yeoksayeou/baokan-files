　　Xinhua News Agency, East China, 18th—Around the Spring Festival, the East China People's Liberation Army saved contributions to relieve the poor people in the newly recovered areas. Before the Spring Festival, the directly subordinate team of a certain unit visited poor residents in their stationed area to learn about their suffering. After that, each unit voluntarily saved food and vegetables for relief. A catering unit of the unit saved 325 jin of millet, 500 jin of radish, and 53 jin of pork, and donated 43,000 yuan in North Sea currency, which was sent to poor farmers and the families of revolutionary martyrs, revolutionary soldiers, and revolutionary cadres in the stationed area for the New Year. A certain regiment handed over all 1,882,300 yuan in North Sea currency, 148,000 jin of vegetables, and 1,160 jin of grain they had donated to the democratic government for disaster relief. He Haiquan, the squad leader of the second squad of a certain regiment's first company, felt very sad when he saw his landlord eating bran pancakes during the New Year. He convened a squad meeting to discuss the matter. Zhang Jia Cai, the deputy squad leader, took out his 10,000 yuan disability pension, and soldier Zhang Mingqing took out 10,000 yuan in injury compensation. The whole squad collected a total of 50,000 yuan to help the old landlord overcome production difficulties. Many newly liberated soldiers also enthusiastically made donations. Luo Xianzhong, a newly liberated soldier from the second company of a certain regiment, used a silver dollar he had saved to buy cabbage, steamed buns, tofu, and grain, which he sent to the family of Xue Yongxing, a poor farmer in the village where he was stationed.
