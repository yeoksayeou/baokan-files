　　Shameen, Northern Shaanxi, New China News Agency, 26th. Radio Communication Agency, Prague: The Greek Interim Democratic Government issued a public statement on the 21st regarding the death of Bebelis, addressed to the Greek working class, the Greek people, and the democratic masses of the world, stating: The royalist fascist elements have been trying for months to force Bebelis to condemn the democratic government. However, this heroic son of the Greek working class never yielded. Therefore, they murdered him in the manner of the Hitler bandits and with the tricks of the American bandits. The public statement directly accuses the American rulers, holding them responsible for Bebelis's death. The statement calls on Greek working men and women to fight back against this despicable crime, and to commemorate their General Secretary of the Trade Union by expanding the ranks of the democratic army. The Central Committee of the Greek Communist Party also issued a public statement on the 22nd stating: In memory of Bebelis, the Greek Democratic Army will establish a unit named the Bebelis First Proletarian Division. From February 20th to April 20th, all workers from Bebelis's hometown of Volos, as well as those coming to join the democratic army from Piraeus and Athens, will be incorporated into this division.

  　号召扩大民主军队来纪念贝贝利加斯
    【新华社陕北二十六日电】电通社布拉格讯：希腊临时民主政府二十一日就贝贝利加斯遇害事，向希腊工人阶级、希腊人民以及全世界民主大众发表公报称：保皇法西斯分子数月来便力图迫使贝贝利加斯谴责民主政府。但是，这个希腊工人阶级英勇的儿子绝不屈服。因此，他们就用希特勒匪徒的方式和美国匪徒的技俩杀害了他。公报直接控告美国统治者，要他们对贝贝利加斯的遇害负责。公报呼吁希腊男女工人反击这个卑怯的罪行，并以扩大民主军的队伍来纪念他们的工会总书记。希腊共产党中央委员会亦于二十二日发表公报称：为了纪念贝贝利加斯，希腊民主军将成立命名为贝贝利加斯第一无产阶级师的部队。从二月二十日起到四月二十日止，从贝贝利加斯故乡倭罗城以及从比里犹斯与雅典前来参加民主军的全体工人将编入该师。
