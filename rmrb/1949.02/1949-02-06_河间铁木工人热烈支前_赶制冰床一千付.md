【Report from Central Hebei】The workers of the Xin Xin Iron and Wood Factory, under the Central Hebei Engineering Bureau, residing in Hejian City, enthusiastically supported the front, overcame difficulties, and completed the task assigned by their superiors to make one thousand ice sleds.
    Hejian City is a dry land area, and the workers originally lacked the technology and habit of making ice sleds. After receiving the task on New Year's Day, the factory manager and the Engineering Bureau immediately went to Baiyang Lake to learn, observed the style of the ice sleds, and measured the dimensions. Because the task was large, the number of people was small, and the time was short, fearing that it would not be completed on time, they first bought four hundred from Baiyang Lake, made one hundred in Huibo Estuary, and the remaining five hundred were the responsibility of the factory (according to the factory's and the city's workers' conditions, it still could not be completed). The factory only had four furnaces, so the blacksmith worker Zhuang Xinghe was responsible for organizing nine furnaces and organized many furnaces from various places outside the city. A total of one hundred and eighty-five iron and wood workers were invited to the factory to rush the work. The workers arrived on the sixth, conducted education and mobilization, and proposed: In order to liberate Tianjin and guarantee completion of the task on time (half a month). The workers' morale was high. Zhang Renzi, a blacksmith worker from Xicai Village, Xianxian County, thirty miles away, received the notice on the fourth. Fearing that he would miss the task, he did not even bother to eat breakfast, and rushed over with two pancakes. While the workers in the factory were eating, he tended the furnace. After they finished eating, he lit the furnace for him, and then he ate, and he worked quickly and well. Trainee Zhang Tingxian was only eighteen years old, small in stature, and weak in strength. Other workers rested when they were tired, but he did not rest. When his hands became swollen, he said that he would complete the task even if his hands were swollen.
    The spirit of mutual assistance and fraternity was displayed in the work. Some workers found it difficult to weld iron plates. The worker Xu Qinghe taught others the method he used in the past to cut iron with a *kezi* (similar to a blacksmith's guillotine shear, but very large). The workers worked from dawn until 12 o'clock at night before going to sleep. The weather was so cold, they worked so hard that they were stripped to the waist and covered in sweat. Zhuang Xinghe from Xing Tie Furnace in West Street, without affecting his own work, automatically went to each furnace day and night to supervise and inspect, and reported the quantity and quality of completion, encouraging the furnaces in the city. Not only was it completed on time, but it exceeded the target by fifty-two ice sleds.

　　河间铁木工人热烈支前
  　赶制冰床一千付
    【冀中讯】冀中工务局住河间市的新新铁木工厂工人热烈支前，克报困难，完成了上级给予的做一千个冰床的任务。
    河间市是旱地，工人本来没有做冰床的技术与习惯。元日接到任务后，该厂经理和工务局即忙到白洋淀去学习，看了冰床的样式，丈量了尺寸。因为任务大、人少、时间又短，怕到期完不成，便先到白洋淀买了四百个，在惠伯口做了一百个，其余五百个由本厂负责完成（根据该厂及市内工人条件还是完不成），该厂只有四盘炉，由市内铁匠工人庄兴和负责组织九盘炉，并到市外各地组织了许多炉。共请一百八十五个铁木工人到该厂赶作。六号工人到齐，进行了教育动员，并提出：为解放平津保证到期（半月）完成任务。工人情绪高涨。卅里路远的献县西蔡村铁匠工人张仁子四号接到通知后，恐怕误了任务连早饭也没顾得吃，带着二个饼子就赶到了，该厂工友们吃饭，他盘炉子，等他们吃完了饭给他点着炉子，他才吃饭，做起活来又快又好。学员张廷宪才十八岁，个子小，力气又小，别的工人＠累了即歇歇但他不休息。把手颠肿了他说把手颠肿了也要完成任务。
    工作中发挥了互助友爱精神，＠铁板一般工人感到困难，工人徐庆和把他过去修用克子（类似铁匠的铡剪，可是很大）剪铁的办法教给了别人。工人们都由天亮一直做到晚十二点才睡觉。天气这样冷，作起活来光着膀子累得满身大汗。西街庄兴铁炉庄兴和在不影响自己工作外不管黑夜白日，自动到各炉去督促检查，回来报告完成数量与质量鼓舞着市内各炉。到期不但完成，而且超过了五十二个冰床子。
