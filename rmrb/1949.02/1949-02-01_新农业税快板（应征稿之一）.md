　　New Agricultural Tax Clapper Talk (One of the Solicited Manuscripts)
　　Gao Ge
　　Editor's Note: The new agricultural tax clapper talks solicited by this newspaper have been evaluated by the Ministry of Finance in the first batch, and the second batch is also under evaluation. The excellent ones will be published successively for publicity in various places, so that the spirit and algorithm of the new agricultural tax can be widely spread among the people.
　　　　
　　Our farmers, cultivate farmland, and should bear the burden in principle. The progressive cumulative tax implemented in the past was for the government's resistance against Japan. The landlords and rich peasants were not eliminated, and there were still old feudal elements. Those with money should pay, and those without money should not bear the burden. This good method supported our front lines, and our troops had food and clothing. It played a very obvious role in driving away the Japanese devils.
　　Now, it's different from before. The land reform has been realized, and most of the poor people have turned over and eliminated the dog feudalism thoroughly. Everyone should work hard to get rich, and production should be stepped up. If we continue to implement progressive tax, it will limit production. The People's Government has made important regulations, and the new tax rules are really perfect.
　　Speaking of perfection, it is really perfect. Let's talk about its benefits. One stone of grain is considered a standard mu, and one dou is calculated as one fen. One standard mu is deducted for each person, and only the remainder is taxed. If the output is assessed truthfully, the burden of grain is fixed. One burden mu is 25 Jin, which is both simple and easy to calculate. The local grain payment is not much, and the additional levy of 5 Jin is sufficient for insurance. Apply more fertilizer, process more, and select seeds well every year. Deep plowing and more fertilizer application, weeds in the fields should be removed early. As long as you are diligent and thrifty, you can produce more, and it is guaranteed not to be over-burdened. Whoever is diligent will get the benefits, and it is not difficult to get rich. Plant flowers, plant tobacco, plant cotton, hemp and indigo. As long as it is a special crop, it is still burdened according to the general yield. Diligence is sure to get the benefits, and the lazy people will not get ahead. If you don't go to the fields and just be lazy, you will also be burdened by the mu. If you are lazy and produce less, it is difficult to pay less tax.
　　This method is really strong, and the detailed method will be explained again. House base, courtyard and grave, river channels and road yards. There is also land that really does not grow anything, and it is not deliberately left barren. These lands are not taxed, and we all keep them in mind.
　　Newly reclaimed wasteland and newly repaired beaches are exempt from the burden for three full years. If the reclaimed wasteland is six years old, it is the same as raw wasteland. If you want to dig it up and plant it, it will not be burdened within three years. Newly opened canals and newly dug wells, dry land has become paddy fields, and the yield will not be changed within three years, and the tax will still be paid as before. When will the mu be changed? Wait until the fourth year of planting. If the repair cost cannot be recovered in three years, the government should be asked to extend the time. Repair of old canals and old wells, within two years as before. Bamboo gardens, lotus ponds and mountain products, as well as mulberry gardens and orchards, see how much you get in a normal year, and see how much they are worth in total. Only burden 50%, and you can benefit from encouraging cultivation.
　　This calculation is not difficult, let's talk about the exemption point. Regardless of old people and children, regardless of male and female, each person deducts a tax-free point, and then burdens after the deduction. Revolutionary soldiers and staff, their families have no labor force and are in trouble. There are also widowers and orphans, and they ask the government to deduct more points. Soldiers, staff and martyrs are the same as the masses. Female cadres who are divorced from production, deduct tax points after marriage. They are willing to be in their parents' home or in their in-laws' home. This time things are not forced, it is entirely up to her to volunteer. If she does not propose it, it can be calculated in her in-laws' home. Several families support an old man, and they discuss what to do. Decide on the second child or the third child. They often live in other people's homes, and still eat other people's food. They are not deducted at home, but calculated in other people's homes. What about living with a farmhand? Calculate the number of days of eating. The ratio is six months, and you can deduct half of the exemption point yourself, and the host family will also deduct half, and it is better to split it in half. Those who are away from home all year round and do not rely on home for food, and also do business outside, deduct the exemption point in commerce. As long as it is deducted outside, the family will no longer care. What about cattle and donkeys? Deduct 25%, and mules and horses deduct 70%, to encourage the development of livestock. If we pawned someone else's land, the grain yield is calculated in our home. If he still has land to rent out, the tenant should register it, and the two families will discuss how to calculate the burden.
　　If there is an insect plague, drought, or hailstones, the North China People's Government will approve it, and decide according to the situation. Either pay less or postpone it, and the tax can be exempted if the disaster is serious. The river and rain washed away the land, and the number of mu should be revised without delay. If the population dies or increases, or there is a change in livestock, register it again every year, and it will be easier to handle after the investigation is clear. If the grain yield is not accurate, it must be re-evaluated. Combine collection and deliberation to handle things clearly. Anyone who makes false reports or underreports will be punished according to law. If cadres and representatives violate the law, they will be severely punished without mercy. Whoever shields others will also be dealt with in the same way. Deliberately delaying or failing to pay will be fined instead of grain.
　　If we have any opinions, talk to the cadres, don't complain behind your back, and don't be impatient, submit it to the government for resolution, so that things can be handled well.
　　The agricultural tax is really perfect, reasonable and simple, not troublesome, easy to calculate, and very convenient for our farmers. In the future, we will be bold in developing our families, and production must be stepped up. Organize to develop the family, and diligent labor is a good man. Pay the tax and send it to the front line, so that the soldiers can eat their fill and wear warm clothes. Carry our "Three-Eight Rifle", and hold our hand grenades tightly, recover Peiping and Tianjin, and the army will go straight south, capture Chiang Kai-shek, liberate the Chinese mainland, and live and work in peace, do you like it or not!

　　新农业税快板（应征稿之一）
    高歌
    编者按：本报前所征求之新农业税快板，第一批业经财政部评定，第二批亦正在评定中，兹将其评定优良者，陆续发表，以供各地宣传，使新农业税的精神及算法能普遍流传民间。
    　　　　
    咱农民，种庄田，照理应该出负担。过去实行的统累税，政府为的是抗战。地富没消灭，还有老封建。有钱就该出，无钱不负担。这个好办法，支援了咱前线，咱们部队才有吃和穿。打走日本鬼，作用很明显。
    到如今，不同前，土地改革已实现，贫苦人大部翻了身，彻底消灭了狗封建。人人都要来发家，生产都要加油干。再要实行累进税，那就限制了闹生产。人民政府重规定，新的税则真完善。
    说完善，真完善，把它的好处谈一谈，一石谷算个标准亩，打一斗就按一分算。一人扣一个标准亩，剩下来的才负担。如果产量评真实，负担粮食就固定，一个负担亩二十五市斤，又简便来又好算。地方粮款也不多，附征五斤足保险。多上粪、多加工，种子每年好好选。深犁地来多上粪，地里有草早早铲，只要勤俭打的多，保证不叫多负担，谁勤劳来谁便宜，发家致富不难干。种上花，种上烟，种上棉麻和土靛。只要是特种农作物，还是按一般产量来负担。勤劳一准得便宜，调皮懒汉不沾先。不上地，光偷懒，也是按亩来负担。如果懒惰打的少，想少纳税难上难。
    这办法，实在强，详细办法再讲讲。房基地，院和坟，河流水渠和路场。也有土地真不长，不是故意把它荒。这些土地不纳税，咱们大家记心肠。
    新开荒，新修滩，免出负担整三年。熟荒若是六年整，这和生荒一样看。你要把这刨开种，三年以内不负担。新开渠，新打井，旱地已经变水田，三年以内不改产，出税还是照从前，什么时候才改亩，单等种上第四年。三年捞不回修理费要求政府延时间。修理旧渠和旧井，二年以内照从前。竹园藕池和山货，还有桑园果木园，平常年景收多少，看看共值多少钱。只按五成来负担，奖励培植能沾光。
    这计算，不费难，咱再谈谈免征点。不分老头和小孩，也不分是女和男，每人扣个免税点，扣除以后再负担。革命军人和职员，家没劳力又困难。还有鳏寡孤独户，请求政府多扣点。军人职员和烈士，都和群众是一般。脱离生产女干部，结婚以后扣税点。愿在娘家在娘家，想在婆家也自便。这回事情不强迫，完全在她出自愿。如果她没提出来，可在婆家来计算。几家伙养一老人，他们商量怎么办。决定老二就老二，决定老三就老三。经常住在旁人家，还是吃的人家饭。自己家里不扣除，就在人家来计算。住长工，怎么办？吃饭天数来计算。比仿都是六个月，自己扣半个免征点，主家也要扣一半，停半劈开也好干。常年在外不在家，也不靠家来吃饭，也须在外做买卖，商业上扣了免征点。只要在外扣除了，家里也就不再管。牛和驴，怎么办？扣上四分来计算，骡马一头扣七分，奖励牲口来发展。咱典了，旁人地，产粮就在咱家算。他要还有出租地，出租户应该登记上，究竟怎样算负担，他们两家自商量。
    遭虫灾，遭水旱，或者下了冷子蛋，华北人民政府来批准，看着情况来决定。或少交，或延缓，灾情严重可免征。大河、雨水冲坏地，改订亩数莫怠慢。人口死亡或增加，或者牲口有改变，每年重新登一遍，调查清楚就好办。要是产粮不确实，就要重新来评判。结合征收来评议，清清楚楚把事办。哪个虚报或少报，一定依法来惩办。干部、代表要违犯，加重处罚没情面。谁要包庇别的人，也照以上办法干。故意迟交或不交，不罚粮食就罚款，
    咱要是有意见，找找干部谈一谈，不要背地发牢骚，也不要心里不耐烦，提给政府来解决，这样事情才好办。
    农业税，真完善，又合理，又简便，不麻烦，好计算，对咱农民多方便。今后大胆来发家，生产都要加油干。组织起来把家发，勤俭劳动是好汉。缴了税，送前线，战士吃饱穿的暖。扛着咱那三八式，握紧咱的手榴弹，收复北平和天津，大军直下往南干，捉住南京蒋秃头，解放中国大地面，安居乐业过时光，你看喜欢不喜欢！
