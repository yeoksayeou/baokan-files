【Taihang Electric】Comrade Mu Deshan, a mechanic foreman at the No. 2 Factory of the state-owned Fengfeng Coal Mining Company, has successfully researched sulfur sand, rubber pads, and rubber rings. The drainage pipes in a certain well of the factory all have large heads, and these three materials must be used when connecting the pipe heads. However, these materials were all foreign goods, which were not easy to buy and were expensive. Later, the higher authorities called for creating more substitutes to overcome the difficulty of foreign materials. Comrade Mu Deshan actively responded to this call and researched and trial-produced substitutes, which have recently been successfully researched and are proven to be excellent after trial use. The method for making sulfur sand is: twenty taels of sulfur, ten taels of sand, and four taels of cement are mixed together. After this sand is made, it can connect one pair of eight-inch large-head water pipes, which is only worth 2,500 Jiao (冀钞, Hebei currency), half the price of foreign goods. In addition, woolen blankets smeared with butter were used to replace the hard-to-buy foreign rubber pads, and eight qian (钱, a unit of weight) of foreign thread was used to replace rubber rings. After these three materials were successfully researched, the mine gave special commendation.

　　工人穆德善新创造
  　试制三种代用品成功
    【太行电】国营峰峰煤业公司二厂机务工长穆德善同志，研究硫磺砂、胶皮垫、胶皮圈成功。该厂某井的排水管都是大头，接管子头时，必须使用以上三种材料；但这些材料皆为外货，既不易购买，价钱又大。后来上级号召多多创造各种代用品，克服外来材料的困难。穆德善同志便积极响应这一号召，研究试制代用品，已于最近研究成功，经试用十分优良。硫磺砂的制法是：由硫磺二十两、砂子十两、洋灰四两合制而成。此砂制成后，共可接八寸大头水管一对，只值冀钞二千五百元，比外货便宜一倍。又以羊毛毯抹上黄油代替了不易买到的外来胶皮垫和以八钱洋线代替了胶皮圈。此三种材料研究成功后，该矿特予表扬。
