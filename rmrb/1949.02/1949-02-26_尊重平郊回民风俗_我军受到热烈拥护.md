　　Respecting the Customs of Hui People in the Suburbs of Beiping
  　Our Army Receives Warm Support
    [Beiping Electric Dispatch] The People's Liberation Army in the suburbs of Beiping respects the customs and habits of the Hui people. When a certain regiment of a certain PLA unit was stationed in Xijiazhuang, Changping County, it conducted a survey of the residents and learned that most of the village were Hui people. The regimental leaders immediately instructed all units of the regiment to respect the customs and habits of the Hui people and conducted special education on this matter within the troops. On January 23rd, the unit had a meal together. After receiving one jin of pork per person, they left the village and went to Yangfang Village, where non-Hui people lived, for their meal. This greatly moved the Hui people, who praised our army as the "Number One Army in the World." They wrote a letter to express their respect to all the officers and soldiers of the regiment. Another company of a certain regiment of the PLA, when stationed in Xifu Village, Changping County, in order to respect the local customs and habits of the Hui people, the entire company guaranteed that it would not eat pork during its stay in the village, and returned the pork issued by the higher authorities for the meal. The Hui people in the village were deeply moved upon learning of this matter and voluntarily wanted to buy beef and mutton for the company, but the company politely declined. Because of their exemplary actions, they established a close military-civilian relationship with the local Hui people and the broad masses.

　　尊重平郊回民风俗
  　我军受到热烈拥护
    【北平电】平郊解放军尊重回民风俗习惯。解放军某部某团，驻昌平县西贾庄时，曾进行居民调查，了解该村多为回民，团首长即指示全团各单位，尊重回民风俗习惯，并在部队中专门进行此项教育。一月二十三日该部会餐，于领来每人猪肉一斤后，即离开该村，到另一个非回民住的杨坊村去会餐。使回民甚为感动，称赞我军为“天下第一军”。并写信向该团全体指战员表示敬意。另部解放军某团一连，驻昌平县西府村时，为尊重当地回民风俗习惯，全连保证驻该村期间不吃猪肉，而且把上级发下的会餐猪肉退回。该村回民群众得悉此事后深受感动，自动要给该连买牛羊肉吃，为该连婉词谢绝。由于他们这种模范行动，故与当地回民和广大群众建立了亲密的军民关系。
