△ The World Federation of Democratic Youth, the highest organization of democratic youth worldwide, recently passed a resolution proposing that February 21st be designated as Colonial Youth Day worldwide.

△ The International Student Union, the highest organization of progressive democratic students worldwide, recently decided that April 14, 1949, will be a day to support the Republican youth and students of Spain.

△ TASS reports that the economy of Franco's Spain is on the verge of collapse. Due to a lack of coal and electricity, half of the factories in the province of Barcelona are operating for less than three days a week. The cost of living continues to rise, and there are millions of starving people. The standard of living is extremely low. In the national budget, expenses for military and police forces account for as much as 69 percent.

△ The Soviet Ministry of Foreign Trade and the Romanian trade delegation signed an agreement on exchange of goods and payment for 1949, as well as an agreement on Soviet technical assistance to Romania on January 24. The contracting parties agreed to increase the volume of trade between the Soviet Union and Romania in 1949 to two and a half times that of 1948. In 1949, each of the contracting parties will deliver goods worth approximately 465 million rubles.

△ Denmark and the Soviet-occupied zone of Germany signed a trade treaty in early February, stipulating an exchange of 18 million kroner (Danish currency). Prior to this, the Soviet-occupied zone of Germany had also concluded trade treaties with Sweden, Norway, and Finland.

△ The Executive Bureau of the World Federation of Trade Unions decided on February 2nd to send World Federation of Trade Unions General Secretary Saillant, Vice-Chairman Toledano, Director of the World Federation of Trade Unions Social and Economic Research Department Fischer, and others to attend the meetings of the United Nations Economic and Social Council.

△ Dutch Communist Party Member of Parliament De Groot recently delivered a speech in parliament, opposing Foreign Minister Stikker and right-wing parliamentarians who advocate for aggressive military blocs. De Groot pointed out that if the North Atlantic Treaty is realized, it will mean the collapse of the United Nations. De Groot declared that the strength of the working class is sufficient to deal with the forces that want to launch another war.

△ TASS reported on the 4th, citing the New York Daily Mirror, that General Clay, the commander of the US forces in Germany, sent 200 American aircraft to Italy and handed over 1,000 tons of munitions to the Italian army.

△ Italian newspapers estimate that on December 31, 1948, the amount of paper money in circulation in Italy exceeded 963 billion lire. A year earlier, it was 783 billion lire. This means that in the past year, the amount of lire in circulation increased by 180 billion.
