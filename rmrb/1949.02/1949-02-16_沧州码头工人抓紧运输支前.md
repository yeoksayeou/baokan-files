　　Cangzhou Dockworkers
  　Hastening Transport to Support the Front
    Under the leadership of the Cangzhou Municipal Trade Union, the Cangzhou dockworkers formally established an amateur workers' school in December of last year. There are already 210 participants. The content of the study includes the current international trade union movement situation, worker welfare, etc., and is linked to the practical problems existing locally. In their studies, the workers have conveyed news of victories and mobilized for tasks supporting the front. They are in high spirits, putting forward the slogan: "Guarantee that loading and unloading at this dock will not be delayed. Wherever workers are needed, we will go there!" When urgently transporting grain to the front before the river froze, the workers compared the arithmetic they had learned, comparing grain transport on the frozen river before and after, by water and land. For example, using a boat carrying 100,000 jin on the river is equivalent to the transport capacity of 123 vehicles after the river freezes (calculated at 800 jin per vehicle). They all said, "Isn't transporting after the river freezes a waste of manpower and animal power, and an extra expense for the public?" So they urgently mobilized to help the public find boats. And they urged the boatmen to rush the transport day and night. Thanks to their strict division of labor and hard work, they transported 2,800 bags (eight dou per bag) in one night. In winter, when the river is frozen, the dockworkers have less work, so they also organized production and cooperative societies in their studies. The results are very good.

　　沧州码头工人
  　抓紧运输支前
    沧州码头工人在市职工会领导下，于去年十二月正式成立了工人业余学校。参加者已有二百一十人。学习的内容是：目前国际职工运动形势、工人福利等。并联系当地存在着的实际问题。工人在学习中，曾进行过胜利消息的传达和支前任务的动员。他们情绪很高，提出口号：“保证这个码头上装卸不耽误。那里用工人，就跟到那里去！”在冻河前向前方紧急运粮时，工人就把自己学习的算术，把冻河前后水旱路运粮作了个比较：如在河里用一只装十万斤的船运一次，就顶冻河后用车一百二十三辆的运输力（按每辆车运八百斤计算）。他们都说：“如在冻河后运，不是浪费人力畜力，公家多开支吗？”于是他们就紧急动员起来，帮助公家找船。而且督促船夫，星夜赶运。由于他们的严密分工和努力工作，在一夜之间运走了二千八百条口袋（一口袋八市斗）。冬季河冻，码头工人的工作少，于是他们在学习中又进行了组织生产和组织合作社。效果都很好。
