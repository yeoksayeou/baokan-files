Xinhua News Agency, East China, 24th: As the Kuomintang bandit troops fled the沿江 areas of Nantong, Qidong, and Tianshenggang in northern Jiangsu, they extensively plundered and destroyed. Before fleeing south on January 27th, the enemy in Qidong closed the city gates and carried out extensive looting within the city. The Taichang store alone had 1,000 cartons of cigarettes stolen, and a large quantity of cloth was taken from the Fengchang Silk and Cloth Store. The glass windows of other stores were smashed, and goods were scattered all over the ground, resulting in countless losses. The enemy troops also looted the nearby villages and towns of Huifeng, Touxing, Tai'an, and Guangyi. Before fleeing, the enemy in Tianshenggang destroyed the machinery and vehicles of factories and looted large quantities of grain from the residents. Enemy troops also laid landmines before retreating. More than 70 landmines were laid in Tianshenggang alone, and three children were killed by landmines in Liuqiao Town, north of Nantong. When the above-mentioned areas were liberated, local people formed groups to welcome the Liberation Army with firecrackers. Citizens of Tianshenggang placed branches on the spots where Kuomintang bandit troops had buried landmines to warn the Liberation Army not to step on them. Under the leadership of the democratic government, the citizens are actively carrying out various restoration works. The drivers of the Dayuan Motor Company reassembled the automobile parts that had been dismantled by the bandit troops. The workers and staff of the Tianshenggang Electric Light Company resumed sending electricity to the local area and Tangjiazhai, Nantong, and other places. At present, the democratic order has been rapidly established in various areas along the Yangtze River in northern Jiangsu.
