Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, February 18th: Under the guise of "overall peace," how much "overall" appeal do the Kuomintang die-hards, who are calling for war, still have within their own party? The fact that the pseudo-Premier of the Executive Yuan, Sun Ke, could only summon a total of more than fifty pseudo-Legislative Yuan members in Guangzhou, less than one-tenth of the total of seven hundred and fifty, is one answer. Another answer can be seen in the so-called "National Peace Promotion Association" convened by Pan Gongzhan, one of the leaders of the pseudo-Shanghai Municipal Council "Speaker" group, from the 12th to the 14th. The association, which began preparations on January 8th, spent more than a month preparing and invited pseudo-councils from forty-odd provinces and cities. In the end, only sixteen units, including Pan's own pseudo-Shanghai Municipal Council, sent representatives to participate. What is especially ridiculous is that half of these sixteen units are exiled "speakers" from Shandong, Shanxi, Beiping, Shenyang, Liaoning, and Rehe. Among the nine pseudo-provincial and municipal council representatives who attended the association's "preparatory meeting" on the 8th, these exiled "speakers" accounted for six. The pseudo-councils of Hunan and Taiwan openly refused to send representatives, saying it was due to "transportation issues" and "receiving the notice too late." However, the pseudo-provincial and municipal councils of Jiangsu, Nanjing, and Anhui, which had the most convenient transportation and received the notice the earliest, did not send speakers, but only one or two councilors.

The reason for Pan Gongzhan's disastrous box office performance is partly because, while his stage was still being set up, Bai Chongxi had already preemptively opened an "Eight Provinces and Cities People's Peace Promotion Association" in Wuchang from the 7th to the 9th. The so-called eight provinces and cities are Hubei, Hunan, Jiangxi, Henan, Guangxi, Fujian, Anhui, and Hankou. This meeting announced the establishment of a so-called "Joint Federation of People's Peace Promotion Associations of Various Provinces and Cities Resident in Hubei." Pan Gongzhan had requested the "Eight Provinces and Cities Peace Promotion Association" in Wuchang to send representatives to the Shanghai meeting to "discuss the entire peace plan together," but the reply from Wuchang was "due to transportation issues, this association cannot send representatives to attend." The pseudo-Jiangxi Provincial Council sent its speaker to Wuchang to attend the meeting, while sending its deputy speaker to Shanghai to attend the meeting. The pseudo-Chongqing Municipal Council declared that it would not participate in either side, citing "the distance."

Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, February 18th: The Kuomintang reactionaries' die-hard clique has not only long been completely isolated from the masses of the people, but is now also completely isolated within its ruling institutions. The situation is the same in Nanjing, Shanghai, Guangzhou, and Qingdao. According to a United Press dispatch from Shanghai on the 15th, sent by American imperialism: The Kuomintang mayor and police chief of Qingdao have both fled, but all of their subordinates have remained. The Kuomintang mayor and police chief "expect their subordinates to be accepted by the Communists." The agency's dispatch from Nanjing on the 4th stated: "Former government officials are discussing whether to flee from the Communists or stay in Nanjing. This has created a new term in the Chinese language—namely, "Baihua people." This term is popular in Nanjing and Shanghai to describe political exiles who leave their motherland to escape the Communists. When those who fear the Communists discuss their difficult situation, one often hears such sentences: "I don't want to be a Baihua person—I'll stay here." On the day that Sun Ke's "refugee cabinet," which stubbornly advocated war, announced that it would begin working in Guangzhou, many Kuomintang officials there expressed attitudes contrary to those of Sun Ke and his ilk. According to an Agence France-Presse dispatch from Guangzhou on the 5th: "Those whom Agence France-Presse was able to meet all expressed the hope that the civil war would end soon. It seems that none of them regards the Communists as enemies, and most are tired of war and discouraged."

　　死硬派失去“全面”号召力量
    潘公展又能揽几个顾客！？     
    伪机关人员不愿跟战犯走
    【新华社陕北十八日电】在“全面和平”的招牌下呼吁战争的国民党死硬派，在他们自己党内还有多少“全面”的号召力呢？伪行政院长孙科在广州所能号召的伪立法委员共有五十多名，不足总额七百五十名的十分之一，这是一个答案。另一个答案，见于上海伪参议会“议长”集团首领之一潘公展在十二日至十四日所召集的所谓“全国和平促进会”。该会由一月八日筹备起，筹备了一个多月，邀请了四十几个省市的伪参议会，结果派代表参加的伪省市参议会，连潘匪自己的伪上海市参议会在内，却只有十六个单位。尤其滑稽的是，在这十六个单位中竟有一半是山东、山西、北平、沈阳、辽宁、热河等地的流亡“议长”。在出席八日该会“筹备会议”的九个伪省市参议会代表中，这些流亡“议长”竟占了六个。湖南和台湾的伪参议会公开拒绝派代表出席，说是因为“交通关系”和“接到通知过迟”。但是交通最便利、接到通知最早的江苏、南京、安徽等伪省市参议会也没有派议长来，而只是派了一两个参议员。
    潘公展的卖座如此悲惨，其原因之一是当他的戏台还在布置的时候，白崇禧已于七日至九日在武昌抢先开了一个“八省市人民和平促进会”。所谓八省市是湖北、湖南、江西、河南、广西、福建、安徽、汉口。这个会议宣布成立了一个所谓“各省市人民和平促进会驻鄂联合会”。潘公展曾要求武昌的“八省市和平促进会”派代表出席上海会议“共商整个和平方案”，但武昌方面的回答是“因交通关系，本会不能派代表出席”。伪江西省参议会把议长派到武昌参加会议，而把副议长派到上海出席会议。伪重庆市参议会则以“路远”为辞，宣布对两方均不参加。
    【新华社陕北十八日电】国民党反动派死硬集团不但早已在人民群众中完全孤立，而且现在在其统治机构内部也已经完全孤立。在南京、上海、广州、青岛，情形都是如此。据美国帝国主义的美联社上海十五日电讯称：青岛的国民党市长和警察局长都逃跑了，但所有他们的下属都已经留下来。国民党市长及警察局长“预料他们的下属将为共产党所接受”。该社四日南京电称：“前政府官员纷纷讨论逃避共产党好呢？还是留在南京好。这已经给中国语言创造了一个新名词——即“白华人”。这个名词流行在南京、上海，用以描绘为逃避共产党而离开祖国的政治流亡者。当那些害怕共产党的人们讨论他们的困难局面时，通常听到这样的语句：“我不愿意当白华人——我就留在这里”。在死硬主战的孙科的“逃难内阁”宣布在广州开始办公的一天，该地许多国民党官员却表示了和孙科们相反的态度。据法新社广州五日电称：“法新社所能晤见的人士，都表示希望内战不久就停止。看来他们谁也不把共产党人认为敌人，大多数人已厌战和灰心”。
