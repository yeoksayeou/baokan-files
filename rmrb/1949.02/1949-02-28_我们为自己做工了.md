　　We Are Working for Ourselves Now
    Chang Qi, Electrician of Tangshan Steel Plant
    During the period when the Chiang bandits ruled the steel plant, on the surface, the instruments were ringing, and the workers were working, which seemed like a very busy scene. However, anyone familiar with the internal situation would know that there were many tricks going on in the factory! We were workers in the material warehouse, and every day we only knew to go to work to "receive and issue materials." However, under the dark atmosphere, our spirits were depressed, and everyone was perfunctorily doing their work. No matter how messy the materials and parts were outside the warehouse, no one would bother to organize them. Inside the warehouse, materials, tools, machine parts, electrical equipment, etc., were scattered everywhere. Although we thought about what needed to be done, no one was willing to take the lead.
    Living in such a harsh and dark environment, we looked forward to liberation day and night. What exciting emotions it brought us! Our factory started work on the second day of liberation, and the vast working class began production. Would we continue to be perfunctory as before? We would never be like that again. At the end of last month, we started to organize the warehouse, and we organized it whenever we had free time during work. By the end of the year, we had completely completed the inventory and organization work. A worker named Hou was organizing 53-gallon oil drums that day. In the past, it would take two or three people to move one, but now, he could easily move it to the designated place by himself. Workers Hou Yucheng and Guo Dongzhao were in charge of cutting scrap iron. In the past, they would not start working until after 9 o'clock, but now they realized that this was their own business. They arrived at the site before work every day and started working immediately. In the past, the minimum amount of electricity used per day was more than 1,000 watts, but the amount of scrap iron cut was only a little more than one ton. Now, they work every day before work hours and have learned how to save electricity. They not only save 500 to 600 watts of electricity compared to the past, but also cut more than twice as much scrap iron in one day as before.
    The same work, the same people, why is there such a big difference? The answer can be found in the frank words of the workers. Some workers said: "Who would work like this during the Chiang bandit's rule? At that time, our family of five was simply living in hell. My monthly salary was not enough to eat, and I still had to pay rent. In addition, the hateful bandit army would call you out to dig ditches for three days, and then ask you to repair fortifications for two days. My mother was sick, and the children were crying from hunger, but who cared about you? It really tortured me into a fool. Think about it, who would work hard? Isn't it just spending time in the factory every day, with your heart at home, wasting that little bit of time!
    This time, the factory has become our own, and we are working for ourselves. We can't dawdle like we used to, and we should treat the factory's affairs as our own."
    While working, they also said: "Now we are the masters of the factory. The frontline soldiers are fighting for us, and we in the rear must work harder, step up production, and support the front, so that we can defeat the evil Chiang Kai-shek as soon as possible, completely liberate all of China, and allow all of us oppressed people to gain complete freedom."

### 我们为自己做工了

　　我们为自己做工了
    唐山制钢厂电工长其
    制钢厂在蒋匪统治的时候，从表面看来，仪器在响着，工人在做着，倒是很显得一种忙碌的样子，可是只要熟习内部情况的人，他就可以知道工厂内有着许多花头呢！我们是材料库的工人，每天只知上班“收发材料”，可是在黑暗的气氛笼罩下，精神颓靡不振，每个人都是敷衍着做工，库外无论什么材料零件，乱到怎样程度，也没人去整理它。库内的材料、工具、机件、电气设备等等，东边也是，西边也是，心里虽然想到该做的事，可是谁也不愿出头去作。
    在恶劣而黑暗的环境生活下的我们，整天盼星星盼月亮的，终于盼到解放了。给我们带来了何等兴奋的情绪啊！我们的工厂在解放第二日就开工了，广大的工人阶级在开始生产了，我们还象以前那样敷衍下去吗？决不会象过去那样了。在上月末我们就开始整理仓库，每天工作一有闲空就整理，到年终就彻底完成了清查与整理工作，有位姓侯的工友，这天整理五十三加仑油桶，在以前需要两三个人挪动一个，现在呢，他一个人就可以随便挪到指定的地方。工友侯玉成、郭东昭，他俩担任割废铁的任务，过去上班时非到九点多钟不动手干活，现在他认识到这是自己的事了，每天不到上班时候就到了工地，即开始工作，过去一天，使用电流最少也得一千多瓦特，但割出的废铁也不过一吨多，现在他们每天不到上班时间就干活，并学会怎样节省电流，不但比过去省去五六百瓦特的电，而且一天割出的废铁，超过已往两倍。
    一样的工作，一样的人，为什么有这样的悬殊呢？这在各位工友坦白的说话中可以找到答复。有的工友说：“在蒋匪统治时期谁象这样干呢？那时候我们一家大小五口，简直是过着地狱生活，我每月所得工资还不够吃，但还要付房租。加上那可恶的匪军，三天叫你出夫去挖沟，两天又要出人修堡垒，母亲在病着，孩子饿得哭闹，谁管你呢？真把我折磨的成了一个傻人一样，试想一想，谁还卖力气干活呢？还不是每天身在厂里，心在家里，消磨那点时间啊！
    这回，厂子已成为我们自己的了，我们为自己干活。不能象过去那样磨洋工了，应该把厂里的事，看成自己家里的事情。”
    他们一边干着活一边还说：“现在我们是工厂的主人，前线战士给我们打仗，我们在后方，更要努力工作，加紧生产，支援前线，好早日打垮那万恶的蒋介石，完全解放全中国，让我们被压迫的人们，完全得到自由。”
