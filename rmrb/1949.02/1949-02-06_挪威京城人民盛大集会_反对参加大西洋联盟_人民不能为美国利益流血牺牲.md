　　Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 3rd. On January 28th, a grand gathering was held in Oslo, the capital of Norway, to oppose Norway's participation in the Atlantic Alliance. Professor Kleisberg delivered a speech at the meeting, stating: "I am not a Communist, but I believe it is my responsibility to support those forces that demand our foreign policy should serve the cause of world peace. The Atlantic Pact is a part of the provocations of the aggressors who are preparing a new war against the Soviet people. The interests of the Norwegian people have been betrayed. They are trying to make us shed blood and sacrifice for the sake of American interests. We don't want this!" Professor Kleisberg emphasized that there has always been a good neighborly relationship between the Soviet Union and Norway. The Soviet Union liberated Norway from fascist aggressors and was the first country to withdraw its troops from Norway. Participants also listened attentively to the speech of female writer Thorborg Nedreaas. Nedreaas severely criticized the criminal activities of Norwegian warmongers. Participants repeatedly applauded Kleisberg and Nedreaas' speeches for a long time. Participants unanimously passed a resolution protesting Norway's participation in the Atlantic Pact and sent the resolution to the government and parliament. Prior to this gathering, the organizers distributed a declaration to the people of Oslo, calling on all honest Norwegians to publicly declare their disagreement with the Norwegian government's foreign policy. The declaration stated: The Norwegian people's desire for peace should be the turning point in determining Norway's attitude towards the Atlantic Pact. We do not want our people to be threatened by the horrors of war that can be avoided. The declaration was signed by prominent Norwegian scientists, writers, artists, and doctors.

　　挪威京城人民盛大集会
  　反对参加大西洋联盟
    人民不能为美国利益流血牺牲
    【新华社陕北三日电】一月二十八日，挪京奥斯陆有一个盛大集会，反对挪威参加大西洋联盟。克莱斯堡教授在大会上发表演说称：“我不是一个共产党员，但我认为我有责任去支持那些要求我们的外交政策应为全世界和平事业服务的力量。大西洋公约是侵略者挑衅计划的一环，这些侵略者正在准备对苏联人民进行新战争。挪威人民的利益被出卖了。他们企图使我们流血牺牲，以谋美国的利益。我们不要这个！”克莱斯堡教授强调苏联和挪威之间一直是存在着善邻关系的。苏联曾从法西斯侵略者之下解放挪威，而且是首先从挪威撤退其驻军的国家。参加会议者并聚精会神地倾听女作家托堡·尼德罗斯的演说。尼德罗斯严厉地批评了挪威战争贩子的犯罪活动。与会者对克莱斯堡和尼德罗斯的演说屡次报以长时间的鼓掌。参加会议者一致通过抗议挪威参加大西洋公约的决议；并将决议送交政府和议会。在这次集会前夕，会议的组织者曾向奥斯陆人民散发宣言，号召一切诚实的挪威人公开声明不同意挪威政府的外交政策。宣言声称：挪威人民对于和平的愿望，应是决定挪威对大西洋公约的态度的转捩点。我们不愿意我们的人民受到可以避免的战争恐怖的威胁。宣言的署名者有挪威著名科学家、作家、艺术家和医生。
