Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, February 6th: TASS reports: The celebration of the third anniversary of the founding of the Hungarian Republic was held on January 31st at the Budapest Opera House in the Hungarian capital. Republic President Szakasits, Prime Minister Dobi, Deputy Prime Minister Rákosi, leaders and celebrities from all walks of life, representatives of workers and peasants, and foreign envoys attended the meeting. Dobi delivered a speech at the meeting, emphasizing the great achievements of Hungary's planned economy, the working masses' new attitude towards labor, and the unprecedented increase in labor productivity.

On the occasion of the third anniversary of the founding of the Hungarian Republic, Soviet newspapers have published articles on the achievements of the Hungarian working people in national economic and cultural construction. Izvestia wrote: In the life of every nation, there are major events that fully reflect the urgent expectations of the people. The declaration of the republic in 1946 was such an event for the Hungarian people. The united working class, led by the Hungarian Working People's Party, has now become the recognized leading and decisive force for the vast majority of the Hungarian people. Eighty-six percent of Hungarian workers are now engaged in the socialist sector of industry and transportation. No factory in Hungary now fails to participate in the labor competition to complete the three-year plan ahead of schedule. Simultaneously with the rapid development of the entire national economy, the living standards of the working people are constantly improving. Labor News pointed out: In 1948, the actual wage rate of Hungarian workers was 15 to 20 percent higher than in the last year before the war. The Hungarian countryside is also changing. Three hundred agricultural cooperatives have been established. The task of this powerful new force is to advance and deepen the process of democratic reorganization of the Hungarian countryside that was started by the land reform of 1945. Hungarian rural cooperatives, supported by the state, have become the main suppliers of grain. The young Hungarian republic's industry provides the countryside with more and more tractors, agricultural tools, transportation equipment, and building materials. This year, the number of machine and tractor stations in Hungary will increase to 300, and the total number of tractors will reach 5,000.

    【新华社陕北六日电】塔斯社讯：匈牙利建立共和国三周年的庆祝大会，于一月三十一日在匈京布达佩斯歌剧院举行。共和国总统斯查卡西兹、总理道比、副总理拉科西以及各界领袖与名流、工人与农民的代表及外国使节，均到会参加。道比在会上发表演说，强调指出匈牙利计划经济的伟大成就、劳动大众对劳动的新态度及劳动生产率的空前提高。
    在匈牙利共和国成立三周年纪念日，苏联各报纷纷发表匈牙利劳动人民在国民经济与文化建设上所达到的成就。消息报写道：每一民族的生活中，都有最充分反映人民之迫切期望的大事。一九四六年共和国之宣布成立，对匈牙利人说来便是这种大事。以匈牙利劳动人民党为首的团结的工人阶级，现在已成为匈牙利绝大多数人民所公认的领导的决定的力量。匈牙利工人现有百分之八十六正从事于工业与运输业中社会主义部分的工作。匈牙利现在没有一家工厂不参加争取先期完成三年计划的劳动竞赛。与全部国民经济的迅速发展同时并进的，是劳动人民生活水平的不断提高。劳动报指出：一九四八年，匈牙利工人实际工资率比战前最后一年高百分之十五到二十。匈牙利农村也在改变中。三百个土地共耕合作社已经建立起来。这个强大的新力量的任务，是推进和加深一九四五年土地改革所已开始的匈牙利农村民主改组的进程。有着国家支持的匈牙利农村合作社，已经成为谷物的主要供应者。年青的匈牙利共和国底工业，为农村提供了越来越多的拖拉机、农业工具、运输工具和营造材料。今年，匈牙利的机器与拖拉机站的数目，将增加到三百所，拖拉机的总数将达五千架。
