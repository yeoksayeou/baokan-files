My Father Has Nothing to Say
　　　　Wu Zhanyuan
　　My father is a geomancer, very famous in the dozens of miles around our village. Everyone speaks of "Teacher Wu of West Liukai" with great faith, and people constantly come to him to choose grave sites. People praise my father's extraordinary accuracy in selecting graves. Although my father is such a "good teacher," my family is extremely poor. Sometimes we even run out of food. I have five brothers, and my second and third brothers work as laborers for others. At that time, I also had a money-grubbing idea, wanting to also select graves, get rich, and live a wealthy life.
　　One day, I asked my father, "You can choose good grave sites for others to get rich and prosper. Why don't you choose a good site for ourselves to get rich and prosper, so our family's life won't be so difficult?" Unexpectedly, my father said, "Your brothers are unlucky, even if we find a good site, it won't work. The earth's energy will run away. Poverty is destined, and life and death are determined by fate." This left me speechless.
　　After liberation, with the help of the Communist Party, my family turned over, we were allocated houses and land, and upgraded to new middle peasants. I also joined the workforce. When I returned home this Gregorian New Year, I found that some backward cadres were still asking geomancers to choose grave sites. For example, there is a man named "Erde" in the east street. His brother died one afternoon, and he came to ask my father to pick a good day for burial, saying that he didn't know if his brother's death was due to the grave being damaged or what? He was also afraid that the children in the family would die again, and he spouted a string of superstitious words. After he left, I asked my father, "Didn't you used to say that my brothers were unlucky and couldn't become rich and live a good life, and that even if we found a good grave site, the earth's energy would run away? Since the Communist Party came and liberated our family, our grave hasn't moved, has it? My brothers are still the same, aren't they? Why has our family now become new middle peasants! Furthermore, the landlords and rich people in the liberated areas have lost their lives, haven't they? Weren't their grave sites all "good" sites according to you? Why is everything bad for them now? The poor people in the liberated areas never had good grave sites before, why are they all living good lives now? Are their grave sites all good now?"
　　My father has personally experienced and witnessed all these facts and scenes. These ironclad facts made him no longer adhere to his previous superstitious views. After he heard what I said, he just lowered his head and didn't say a word.

### 我的父亲没话可说了

　　我的父亲没话可说了
    武占元
    我的父亲是个看坟先生，在我村周围几十里内是很著名的，不管谁谈起“西六开武先生”都非常信仰，每天请他看坟的人来往不绝，人们都称赞我父亲看坟异常灵应。虽说我父亲是这样的“好先生”，但是我的家庭却极度的穷困。有时甚至断炊，我弟兄五个，二兄三兄都给人家当雇工。我在当时也曾产生一种财迷思想，也想看坟地，发个财，过个富裕的生活。
    有一天，我问父亲，你能给人家看好坟地，发财致富，你怎么不给咱自己也看块好地，发个财，致个富，家里的生活不是就不困难了吗？”出乎意料之外的，我父亲说：“你弟兄没命，即是看块好地也不行，地脉也要跑了啦。穷是命穷，生死是八字注定了的。”这样把我弄得没话可说了。
    解放后，我家在共产党帮助下翻了身，分了房子又分地，升为新中农，我也参加了工作。在今年阳历年回家时，发现还有个别的落后干部请先生看坟地。如东街有个名叫“二的”，他兄在一天下午死了，来请我父亲看一个好日子埋葬，还说他哥哥的死不知道是坟上被伤了，还是怎回事？又惧怕家里的小孩再死，说出一串的迷信话，他走后，我就问父亲：“你过去不是说俺弟兄没命，不能发家过好时光，就看个好坟地地脉也要跑了吗？自共产党来解放了咱家，咱的坟并未移动呀？俺弟兄还是这个样子呀？为什么咱家现在又成为新中农哩！再说解放区的地主老财命也没了，他们的坟地不是都经你看的“好”地吗？为什么现在一切皆不好了？解放区的穷人从前都没看过好地，为什么现在都过起好生活来了？坟地一切都好了呢？”
    这些事实，这些光景，我的父亲都是亲身经历，亲眼看到的。这些铁的事实，使他不再坚持以前那样迷信的看法了。当他听我说了上面一段话后，只是低着头，一句话也没有说的了。
