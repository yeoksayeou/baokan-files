Xinhua News Agency, North China, February 6th. Telegram from the People of All Circles in North China Celebrating the Liberation of Peiping and Tientsin. The full text is as follows:

    To Chairman Mao of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China, Commander-in-Chief Zhu, all officers and soldiers of the People's Liberation Army, all democratic parties, all people's organizations, and compatriots from all walks of life across the country!

    The people of all circles in North China, with boundless joy and excitement, celebrate the great victory of the People's Liberation Army in liberating Peiping and Tientsin. With the exception of a very few isolated enemy strongholds, the entire territory of North China has been liberated. This is a great victory in the Chinese people's liberation struggle. The achievement of this victory is due to the wise strategic thinking of Chairman Mao, the powerful coordination of all battlefields across the country, the heroic and skillful Northeast People's Liberation Army entering the customs to fight alongside the North China People's Liberation Army, and the long-term arduous struggle of North China and its people for more than a decade. We extend our warm salute to Chairman Mao! We extend our warm salute to Commander-in-Chief Zhu and all officers and soldiers of the People's Liberation Army! We extend our warm salute to all the people in the liberated areas who support the liberation war! We extend our cordial greetings to the people of Peiping, Tientsin, and the newly liberated cities and towns!

    In the two and a half years of the People's Revolutionary War, after annihilating more than four million of Chiang Kai-shek's reactionary troops, the world unanimously recognizes that the Kuomintang reactionaries have been defeated. At this time, the American imperialists instructed the Kuomintang reactionaries to quickly take up political weapons and release a "peace" smokescreen, attempting to confuse the people's vision in order to hide under the cover of this smokescreen, reorganize their remnants, and rebuild their military power to strangle the people once again. Chiang Kai-shek's "retirement" to Fenghua is actually still directing the Kuomintang reactionaries' counter-revolutionary activities. The reactionary government in Nanking is busy relocating offices, transporting materials, and moving troops, rebuilding counter-revolutionary military bases. The people of Nanjing and Shanghai are still suffering from cruel fascist suppression. The "peace" conspiracy played by the reactionaries is very clear to the people of the whole country.

    Recently, Chairman Mao published a statement on the current situation, proposing eight peace terms, thoroughly exposing the hypocritical peace conspiracy of the Chiang-American reactionaries, and pointing out the correct path to achieve true people's democratic peace. The people of all circles in North China express their firm support for these eight terms. Mr. Li Jishen, Mr. Shen Junru, Mr. Ma Xulun, Mr. Guo Moruo and 51 other gentlemen published their opinions on the current situation, declaring their complete support for Chairman Mao's eight terms and demanding that the people's revolution be carried through to the end. The people of North China warmly welcome this.

    Based on their own personal experience, the people of North China clearly recognize the complete hypocrisy of the Kuomintang reactionaries' so-called "peace." After the victory of the Anti-Japanese War, while the military mediation executive group was still negotiating, the Chiang Kai-shek reactionaries began their offensive against North China. To this day, the cities and villages burned and destroyed by the beasts have not yet been restored, and the deep blood debts of the murdered people have not yet been redressed. Therefore, we firmly advocate that Chairman Mao's eight terms must be implemented without discount in order to show that these deceivers, who have been abandoned by the people and have long been proven to be devoid of integrity, still have the minimum sincerity to repent to the people. What particularly angers the people of North China is that the reactionary government in Nanking has unilaterally released Okamura Neiji, the chief Japanese war criminal. They want to use Okamura Neiji to help reorganize their shattered military institutions and slaughter the people again. The Japanese Okamura Neiji was the mortal enemy of the people of North China during the Anti-Japanese War. The people of North China hate him to the bone. Releasing such a chief culprit of aggression against China is intolerable not only to the people of North China, but also to all patriotic people across the country. We firmly support the statement of the spokesperson of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China, ordering the reactionary government in Nanking to immediately re-arrest the criminal and hand him over for people's trial.

    As we warmly celebrate the liberation of Peiping and Tientsin, we have a clear understanding of the current situation. We will never be intoxicated with the great victory we have already achieved. We are sufficiently vigilant against all conspiracies of the Kuomintang reactionary government to ease and undermine the Chinese people's revolutionary movement. The reactionaries are about to die, and their conspiracies will never succeed. We will strengthen construction with excitement and tension, work hard to produce, work hard, mobilize all the manpower, material resources, and financial resources of North China to support the People's Liberation Army, and fight to the end for the liberation of Jiangnan, the liberation of all of China, and the realization of a truly peaceful people's democracy.

　　大会通电原文
    【新华社华北六日电】华北各界人民庆祝平津解放大会通电。全文如下：
    中共中央毛主席，朱总司令，人民解放军全体将士，各民主党派，各人民团体及全国各界同胞们！
    华北各界人民，以无比的欢欣鼓舞，庆祝人民解放军解放北平、天津的伟大胜利。华北全境除极少数敌人孤立据点外，已获解放。这是中国人民解放斗争的伟大胜利。这个胜利之获得，是由于在毛主席英明战略思想的指导下，在全国各战场有力配合下，英勇善战的东北人民解放军入关协同华北人民解放军并肩作战以华北及人民十余年来长期艰苦奋斗的结果。我们谨向毛主席致热烈的敬礼！向朱总司令及人民解放军全体将士致热烈的敬礼！向支援解放战争的解放区全体人民致热烈的敬礼！向平津及新解放城乡的人民致亲切的慰问！
    在两年半人民革命战争中，歼灭蒋介石反动军队四百余万之后，全世界一致承认国民党反动派是已被打败了。在这时候，美帝国主义者又指使国民党反动派迅速拿起政治武器，放出“和平”烟幕，企图迷惑人民的视线，以便躲藏在这烟幕的掩盖之下，收拾残兵败将，重整军力，再来扼杀人民。蒋介石“引退”到奉化，实际仍然指挥着国民党反动派的反革命活动。南京反动政府搬关、搬物资、运军队，正在忙着重建反革命军事基地。京沪人民依然受着残酷的法西斯镇压。反动派所玩弄的“和平”阴谋，全国人民是看得非常清楚的。
    最近毛主席发表对时局声明，提出八项和平条件，彻底揭破了蒋美反动派虚伪的和平阴谋，指明了达到真正的人民民主和平的正确道路。华北各界人民对此八项条件表示坚决拥护。李济深、沈钧儒、马叙伦、郭沫若等五十五位先生发表对于时局的意见，声明彻底支持毛主席的八项条件，要求将人民革命进行到底，华北人民表示热烈欢迎。
    华北人民根据自己亲身经验，清楚认识国民党反动派所谓“和平”的全部虚伪性。抗战胜利以后，军事调处执行小组还在谈判，将介石反动派就开始了对华北的进攻，至今野兽们所焚毁破坏的城市乡村尚未恢复，被残杀人民的血海深仇，尚未昭雪。因此，我们坚决主张，必须不折不扣实行毛主席所提八项条件，才能表示这些被人民唾弃的，早已证明是毫无信义的骗子们尚有向人民悔祸的起码的诚意。特别使华北人民愤慨的是，南京反动政府竟擅自释放日寇首要战犯冈村宁次，他们想利用冈村宁次帮助整顿其残破的军事机构，再来屠杀人民。日寇冈村宁次是抗战时期华北人民的死敌，华北人民恨之入骨，释放这样的侵华罪魁，是不但华北人民，而且全国一切爱国人民所不能忍受的。我们坚决拥护中共中央发言人的声明，命令南京反动政府立即将该犯重新逮捕押交人民审判。
    当我们热烈庆祝平津解放的时候，我们对时局有清醒的认识，我们决不沉醉于已得的伟大胜利，我们对于国民党反动政府企图缓和与破坏中国人民革命运动的一切阴谋，有足够的警惕。反动派即将最后死亡，阴谋绝不能实现。我们将以兴奋紧张的精神，加强建设，努力生产，努力工作，动员华北一切人力、物力、财力支援人民解放军，为解放江南、解放全中国、实现人民民主的真正和平而奋斗到底。
