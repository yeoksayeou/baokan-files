[Hebei News] Baoding was a semi-colonial market before the war, flooded with foreign goods and used by imperialists to absorb Hebei's "industrial raw materials," which doomed its industry to stagnation. After more than ten years of devastation by the Japanese invaders and Chiang Kai-shek's bandits, the number of industrial and commercial households decreased from 2,948 to 2,327. When Chiang Kai-shek's bandits fled last November, they carried out another large-scale looting, leaving Baoding's industry and commerce riddled with holes.

After liberation, the Military Control Commission announced a policy of protecting and developing industry and commerce on the first day of entering the city. After the efforts of the Party, government, army, and people, the reconstruction of industry and commerce began on the ruins destroyed by the Japanese invaders and Chiang Kai-shek's bandits. State-owned enterprises such as Dasheng, Yusheng, and Shiye transported large quantities of oil, salt, coal, and grain into the city on the third day after liberation. 200,000 catties of wheat, 1 million catties of bituminous coal, 100,000 catties of salt, and 50,000 catties of oil have been transported. The daily necessities of the citizens have been adequately supplied; with the arrival of coal, the city's electricity supply has also been guaranteed. Grain shops and 80% of the coal shops in the city have also been restored and become active under the leadership of state-owned companies. In order to supply the urgent needs of the citizens, state-owned companies have set up retail and wholesale outlets on the one hand, and entrusted sales on the other. The privately-owned Fuhegong Flour Company was destroyed by Chiang Kai-shek's bandits last July and was unable to operate, so it stopped work. After liberation, the democratic government allocated 100,000 catties of military wheat to be ground by hand, and the company was able to resume operations. The Baoding office of the People's Bank issued loans of 98.765 million yuan from December 10th to 22nd to support small-scale industry and commerce: a total of six waterwheel factories, fifteen workshops, one hundred and eighty-nine poor people, and twenty-one small businesses resumed production. The workers of state-owned enterprises are working with great enthusiasm to restore and build their enterprises. Workers at the Electric Light Company overcame various difficulties and repaired the generators, water pipes, and water tanks that had been damaged by the enemy, and started supplying electricity within six days. On New Year's Day, the company's employees voluntarily proposed to waive their annual leave and rush to repair equipment damaged by the bandits. After five days of active repairs by employees of state-owned and private flour companies, the machinery destroyed by Chiang Kai-shek's bandits began to operate again. Grain, cotton, cloth, fresh fruits, medicinal materials, and wood and stone industrial raw materials from the countryside have been continuously entering the city, and the city's industry and commerce have begun to export, establishing economic ties between the city and the countryside. According to the statistics of the Municipal Bureau of Industry and Commerce on December 6th, the number of commercial firms alone has reached 3,335, an increase of 43% compared with the time when Chiang Kai-shek's bandits occupied the city.

What the city should strive to do in the future is to organize citizens' production and transfer businesses dealing in non-essential goods for the people to other industries.

When the People's Bank issued loans, it paid attention to supporting factories, mills, oil presses, and poor citizens that were beneficial to the national economy and the people's livelihood but were unable to operate, but it has not yet been able to further organize citizens to produce through loans. After poor citizens get loans from the bank, they mostly wholesale peanuts and dates and deal in consumer goods in a scattered manner. If they do not actively engage in production, their lives cannot be completely solved. There are still nearly a thousand scattered looms rusting in the city. If they are put into operation, they can solve the lives of two thousand poor households.

There are nearly a hundred shops in Baoding that deal in gold jewelry, pawnshops, cosmetics, antiques, and other non-essential goods for the people. Because their operations have little to do with the actual lives of the people, they have no prospect of development. The democratic government should lead and organize them to shift to businesses that meet the needs of the vast majority of citizens.

### 保定工商业渐趋发展　今后应努力组织市民生产

　　保定工商业渐趋发展
  　今后应努力组织市民生产
    【冀中讯】保定在战前是个外货充斥而又为帝国主义吸收河北“工业原料”的半殖民地商场，注定了工业不能发达。经过日寇与蒋匪十多年摧残，工商业户从二千九百四十八户减少到二千三百二十七户。去年十一月蒋匪逃跑时又实行了一次大抢掠，保定市的工商业已是百孔千疮。
    解放后，军管会入城第一天宣布了保护与发展工商业政策，经过党政军民的努力，在日寇蒋匪破坏的废墟上，开始了工商业的重建工作。大生、裕生、实业等公营企业在解放后的第三天，便大批地运输油、盐、煤、粮入市。已运到小麦二十万斤，烟煤一百万斤，盐十万斤，油五万斤。市民生活必需品得到充足的供应；随着煤的运来，全市用电也有了保证。全市粮栈及百分之八十的煤栈，在公营公司的带动下，也恢复、活跃起来。公营公司将运来的物品为了供应市民急需，一面设门市部零整批发；一面委托代售。私营福和公面粉公司，于去年七月惨遭蒋匪摧毁无力经营而停工，解放后民主政府拨了十万斤军麦代磨手工得以复业。人民银行保定办事处，从十二月十号到二十二号发放贷款九千八百七十六万五千元扶助小本工商业：计六家水车厂，十五家作坊，一百八十九家贫民，二十一家小商复业生产。公营企业工人们更以高度热情从事企业的恢复建设。电灯公司的工人排除各种困难，修复了被敌破坏的发电机，水管，蓄水箱等，于六日内开始送电。新年元旦，该公司的职工自动提出免除年假，赶修遭匪破坏的器材。公营和私营面粉公司的职工经过五日的积极修理，为蒋匪破坏的机器又转动起来了。农村中的粮、棉、布，及鲜果、药材、木石工业原料，接连入市，城市的工商业开始输出，城市与乡村建立起经济的联系。据市工商局十二月六日的统计，仅商号已达三千三百三十五家，比过去蒋匪盘据时增加了百分之四十三。
    今后该市应努力的是，组织市民生产与使非人民必需品商业转业。
    人民银行发放贷款时，注意了扶植有利国计民生而又无力经营的工厂、磨坊、油坊及贫苦市民，但还未能进一步的通过贷款把市民组织起来生产。贫苦的市民从银行贷款后，多分散的趸花生、枣，经营消费品。这样不积极从事生产，是不能彻底解决他们的生活问题的。该市现在还有近千张分散的织布机生着锈，如果使其活动起来，能解决两千户贫民的生活。
    保定经营金珠、首饰店、当铺、化妆品、古玩等人民非必需品的行业近百家。因为他们这些经营对人民的实际生活关系不大，是没有发展前途的。民主政府就应当领导组织他们转向适合广大市民需要的经营。
