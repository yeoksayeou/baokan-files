After the above various experiments have gained experience, they will be promoted to various places. (3) Duckbill wheat has strong resistance to jaundice, and its growth situation and yield comparison should be summarized in preparation for promotion. (4) Utilize different seasons, temple fairs, small-scale exhibitions, technical seminars, and printing technical propaganda materials to carry out agricultural technical publicity and education.
