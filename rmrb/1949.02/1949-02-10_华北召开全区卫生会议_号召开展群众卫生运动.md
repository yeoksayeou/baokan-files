　　North China Holds Regional Health Conference
  　Calling for a Mass Hygiene Campaign
    [This Newspaper's News] The North China People's Government Health Department convened a regional health work conference on January 18th. More than 60 representatives attended, including health cadres from the prefectural level and above from Ji'zhong, Taihang, Taiyue, Ji'nan, Beiyue, Jinzhong, and Ji'lu'yu, as well as representatives from the Health Department's directly affiliated institutions such as the Shijiazhuang Municipal Hospital and the Cadre Sanitarium. The conference lasted for eight days. After group reports from each district and general discussions, Deputy Minister of Health Comrade Zhu Lian gave a concluding report. She pointed out that although there had been many achievements in health work in the past, the people's health knowledge was still very lacking, so there were many diseases and disasters in various parts of North China. According to a survey in Ji'zhong in 1947, cholera epidemic areas had spread as far as 80 to 120 li, a very serious situation. In Bo'ai County, Taihang, an average of 19 out of 100 people suffered from cholera. Smallpox was also very prevalent in the second district of Taihang. However, many people in some areas are still very superstitious. When they get sick, they don't go to a doctor for treatment, but instead ask some sorcerers and Taoist priests to see them, so the mortality rate from diseases is very high. Therefore, there is an urgent need to launch a mass hygiene campaign. The first is to unite all Chinese and Western medicine doctors to serve the people together. She pointed out that this is possible and necessary. Chinese medicine has a history of 5,000 years and has very good prescriptions. Western medicine has a responsibility to take the initiative to unite, educate, and transform Chinese medicine, to bring its useful experience into play and remove its idealistic parts, to achieve "the scientification of Chinese medicine" and "the Sinicization of Western medicine."
    The second is maternal and child health and the training of midwives. At present, the most painful problem for farmers is the death of infants, especially many infants die from umbilical cord infections. The Ji'jin'yu Health Bureau made a statistic in a certain place: almost 75 out of 100 infants born die; a survey in a certain area of Ji'nan also showed that those who die from umbilical cord infections account for 65 percent. Some women give birth to twelve children and only two survive, and some give birth to seven or eight and none survive. Many women also die from puerperal fever. In addition, there are those who are infertile. According to statistics from the Harrison Hospital outpatient department, 80 out of 100 women come to seek treatment in order to have children. Therefore, maternal and child health issues and the training of midwives, and the transformation of old-style midwives, are one of the most important tasks in current health work.
    Regarding health construction, she put forward the following items. (1) Preventive health: Universally implement vaccination, injection of preventive needles, and instillation of hygiene common sense. All health agencies and hospitals have the responsibility to help the masses carry out disease prevention. (2) Rectify hospitals: One type is those with very good conditions (large cities), which can run regularized hospitals. On the one hand, carry out treatment, and on the other hand, train technical cadres. The second type is publicly run hospitals, enterprise-style operation, which should have a certain number of beds for paying and free patients. The purpose is not to make money, but the cost of medicine should be recovered. The third type is those run by counties and districts, or those of a public-private nature. The government should encourage the masses to run their own and provide assistance. The medical cooperative run by Dalingxiao Village in Shen County has many members who have bought shares, which not only solves the problem of medicine, but also allows them to share dividends. At a minimum, counties and districts should have medical cooperative organizations, and encourage and reward the collection, production, and cultivation of medicinal herbs, and strictly ban fake medicines. (3) Organizational structure: In principle, it is determined that health organizations can be established separately within the scope of their own establishment. In addition, medical associations and other organizations should also be established in a planned way, but they are mass organizations and have no administrative power. Agencies above the administrative office should plan to train and cultivate midwives, and counties and districts should, as far as possible, transform old-style midwives. Agencies above the administrative office and health agencies should focus on sending people to help with the work, and agencies above the administrative office should train doctors and acupuncture personnel.

　　华北召开全区卫生会议
  　号召开展群众卫生运动
    【本报讯】华北人民政府卫生部于一月十八日召开全区卫生工作会议。到会有冀中、太行、太岳、冀南、北岳、晋中、冀鲁豫等专署以上卫生干部及石家庄市立医院、干部疗养院等卫生部直属机关代表六十余人。会议共开八天，经过各区小组汇报与大会讨论，最后由卫生部副部长朱琏同志做总结报告。她指出：过去卫生工作虽已有不少成绩，但人民的卫生知识还很缺乏，所以华北各地病灾很多。据冀中一九四七年调查，霍乱流行区曾蔓延到八十里至一百廿里远，情况非常严重。太行博爱县平均一百人有十九人害霍乱。天花在太行二分区也流行得很厉害；但有好多地区群众还很迷信，有了病不去请医生治，却请一些神婆道士之流来看，因之，病的死亡率都很大。所以现在急须开展一个群众性的卫生运动。首先是团结一切中西医生，共同为人民服务。她指出这是可能的，必须的。中国的医学有五千年的历史，有很好的良方，西医有责任主动地去团结、教育、改造中医，发挥其有用的经验，去掉其唯心的部分。做到“中医科学化”，“西医中国化”。
    其次是妇婴卫生及培养助产士。目前农民最感痛苦的就是婴儿的死亡问题，特别是死在脐带风上的婴儿很多。冀晋豫卫生局在某地做了一个统计：生一百个婴儿差不多要死七十五个；冀南某地区的调查，死在脐带风上的也占百分之六十五。有的妇女生了十二个只活了两个，有的生了七、八个一个也没活成。产妇得产褥热死的也不少。另外还有不生育的。据哈里逊医院门诊部的统计：一百个妇女里有八十个是为了要生小孩来求治的。因此妇婴问题和培养训练助产士，改造旧产婆，是当前卫生工作中很重要的任务之一。
    关于卫生建设，她提出以下几项。（一）防疫卫生：要普遍实行种痘、注射防疫针、灌输卫生常识。所有卫生机关、医院都有帮群众进行防疫的责任。（二）整顿医院：一种是有很好条件的（大城市），可以办正规化的医院。一方面进行治疗，一方面要培养训练技术干部。第二种是公营的医院，企业化的经营方式，它要有一定的收容床位和免费床位，目的不是要赚钱，但应当收回医药成本。第三种是县区办的，或民办公助性质的。公家应提倡群众自己办，并给予帮助。（三）根据各地区需要，号召群众自己普遍组织医药合作社，公家尽量给以帮助。深县大凌霄村办的医药合作社，很多群众都入了股，这样既解决了吃药问题，又可分到红利。最低限度县区要有医药合作社的组织，并提倡奖励采药、制药、种药，严格取缔假药。（四）组织机构：原则上确定在本身编制范围以内，可以单独设立卫生组织。另外还应当有计划的成立医药联合会等组织，但它是群众团体，没有行政权。行署以上机关，应有计划的训练培养助产士，各县区尽可能改造旧式产婆，行署及卫生机关应有重点的派人下去帮助工作，行署以上机关要培养医生培养针灸人材。
