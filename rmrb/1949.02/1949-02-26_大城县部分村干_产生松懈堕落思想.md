Editor's Note: The emergence of lax and corrupt thinking among some cadres and party members in Dacheng Village is a problem that deserves high vigilance from all localities. Under the new victorious situation, it is necessary to further strengthen cadre education, mobilize all cadres to continue their efforts, and patiently educate and engage in uncompromising ideological struggle against any erroneous ideological tendencies of laxity and corruption to overcome them; and to make all comrades recognize the new great tasks, be more active and strive to complete the current new work tasks.
[Jizhong News] Some village-level cadres in Dacheng County have developed a kind of lax, pleasure-seeking and decadent thinking since the liberation of Tianjin and Beijing, and their work has become slack. According to reports from the district party committee secretaries of various districts: some village cadres in some villages are not down-to-earth in their work, demanding to "go to Tianjin to see" or do business, and some cadres even demand resignation. Xue Junjie, the public security officer of Suzhuang in the Third District, deliberately did not attend the meeting when he was asked to, and went out to do business the next day. Liu Xibao, the public security officer of Dengliang Village in the Fifth District, not only did not work, but also gathered people at home for gambling; when district cadres asked him to talk about work, he pretended to be sick and refused to see them; when district cadres criticized him, he insisted on his mistakes and refused to accept them. When the district cadres assigned Liu Derong, the chairman of the village representative meeting, to do entertainment work for the Spring Festival, Liu Derong deliberately refused to do it and went away for several days to visit relatives. In Luo Jia Village, in the Second District, the land certificates have not been completely distributed, and the problems left over from the land reform have not been clarified, and all the village cadres demanded a "change."

　　大城县部分村干
  　产生松懈堕落思想
    编者按：大城村部分干部党员产生了松懈堕落思想，这一问题值得各地高度警惕。在新的胜利形势下，必须进一步加强干部教育，动员全体干部继续努力，对于任何松懈堕落的错误思想倾向，都必须进行耐心教育和不调和的思想斗争，加以克服；并使全体同志认识新的伟大任务，更加积极奋发，为完成当前新的工作任务而努力。
    【冀中讯】大城县有些村级干部，自平津解放后，产生了一种松懈享受堕落思想，工作懈怠。据各区区委书记汇报：有些村庄村干部工作不踏实，要求“到天津看看”或做买卖，甚至有些干部要求退职。三区苏庄公安员薛俊杰，叫他开会故意不到场，第二天出门去做买卖。五区邓良村公安员刘锡保，不但不作工作，反而在家成局聚赌；区干部找他谈工作，装病不见；区干部批评他，还坚持错误不肯接受。区干部给村代表会主席刘德荣布置春节娱乐工作，刘德荣故意不干，走亲拜年好几天不回来。二区骆贾村土地证没发完，土地改革中遗留的问题也未弄清，全体村干部要求“换换”。　　　　　　　　　　（秦德林）
