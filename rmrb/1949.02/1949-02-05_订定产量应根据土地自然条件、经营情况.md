Title: Production Quotas Should Be Determined Based on Natural Land Conditions and Management Practices

Inquiries and Answers

　　To the Editors of the People's Daily:
    There is a question in the "assessment" work that we would like you to answer: We encountered many villages where the production quota for irrigated and dry land was not handled reasonably. For example, there is land that is technically irrigated, but due to a lack of tools, it is impossible to irrigate, resulting in reduced yields. Such land requires 60 to 80 "dou" (a unit of volume) of water wheel, or two head of small livestock to pull it. Even digging a well would require a very deep one, and the water would be scarce during droughts. Only households with tools can irrigate, and most cannot produce the expected yield. In the past, we set the production quota for this type of land as irrigated land, believing that this would stimulate production. However, this year, during our investigation of the autumn grain burden in Yuanshi, we found that the households cultivating this type of irrigated land had a heavy burden (better for middle peasants who have tools), which led to an imbalance in the burden. How should the production of this type of land be handled?

    The determination of the "normal annual yield" of land should be based on the natural conditions of the land, and with reference to the general management conditions of local farmers in recent years, with the harvest volume in a normal year as the standard. The natural conditions of the land refer to the quality of the soil, whether it can be irrigated (there should be a distinction between well irrigation and river irrigation), whether it is exposed to wind, and whether it is sunny or shady (mountain land). The general management situation of the land refers to the management situation of most farmers in the local area in the most recent three or four years. If the same soil quality has increased production due to increased processing and diligent fertilization, it should not be raised; at the same time, reductions due to lazy cultivation, less labor, and less fertilization should not be reduced. The type of irrigated land you mentioned, with deep wells and scarce water, limited by the availability of water wheels and the quality of livestock, should be determined based on the management situation of most local farmers in the recent three or four years, the quality of the land, and the harvest volume in a normal year. It should not be based solely on the soil quality without reference to the general management situation of local farmers in recent years.

### 订定产量应根据土地自然条件、经营情况

专栏：询问与答复

　　订定产量应根据土地自然条件、经营情况人民日报编辑同志：
    在“评丈”工作中有一个问题请你们答复：我们在工作中遇到许多村庄水旱地的产量问题处理得不够合理。如有一种地是水地，但因缺乏工具，无法浇水，致使产量减少。这种地按水车得六十至八十个斗子，小牲口得两头才能拉动，就是开井吧，也要很深的才行，而到天旱时水就少了，除了有工具的户能浇外，一般的都生产不到应产量。我们过去对这种地是按水地订产量的，以为这样能刺激生产。但今年我们在元氏调查秋屯负担中，看到凡种此种水地的户，负担都重（中农比较好些，有工具），因此在负担上也就不平衡。这种地的产量，究竟应如何处理，请答复！

    土地“常年应产量”之订定，应根据土地自然条件，并参照当地近年一般农户经营概况，以当地一般年头下的收获量为标准。土地的自然条件，是指地板好坏，能否浇水（井浇和河浇应有分别），犯风不犯风，向阳或背阴（山地）等。土地之经营概况是指当地大多数农民最近三四年来的经营情形，如系同样土质因多加工勤施肥而增产的，不应提高；同时怠于耕作少用工少施肥减产的亦不予减低。你提的这种水地井深水缺，限制于水车有无，和牲口好坏，若因无水车牲口而影响产量降低，这应根据当地大多数农民最近三四年来的经营情形、土地质量及一般年头下的收获量为标准来订定。不能单凭土质而不参照当地近年一般农户之经营概况。
