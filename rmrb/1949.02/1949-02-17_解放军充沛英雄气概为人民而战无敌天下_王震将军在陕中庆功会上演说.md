Xinhua News Agency, Northwest, 15th. A unit of the Northwest Field Army of the People's Liberation Army held a celebration meeting in a certain area on the central Shaanxi front to celebrate the unit's annihilation of more than 40,000 Kuomintang bandit troops in 1948. Tens of thousands of soldiers and civilians celebrated the more than 700 people's meritorious officials and the unit's heroic cause amidst the sound of gongs and drums. General Wang Zhen, commander of the unit, delivered a speech at the meeting. He first pointed out: "The glorious victory of 1948 was achieved through the hard work and continuous combat of all commanders and fighters, through the bloody battles of many comrades who embraced the great spirit of self-sacrifice for the benefit of the people, and through the enthusiastic support of the army and active support of the front lines by hundreds of thousands of people in the liberated areas." At this point, General Wang Zhen led all the soldiers and civilians to stand in silence and pay tribute to the martyrs who heroically sacrificed in the battle and to the more than 700 combat heroes. General Wang Zhen continued, "Our People's Army is a heroic army unparalleled in history. In the past, we trekked through snowy mountains and grasslands, ate tree bark and gnawed on grass roots, and overcame all kinds of difficulties. We never flinched. Because we have the thought of Comrade Mao Zedong as our guide, and we are united with the working people, we will surely achieve victory. In the past, no matter how difficult the environment, Comrade Mao Zedong always told us with confidence: 'Comrades, we must win, we must resolutely strive for victory, the old world must be smashed, and a new society must be built in our hands.' We are deeply educated by Comrade Mao Zedong, and we are fighting for Comrade Mao Zedong's lofty ideals and for the greatest benefit of the people. Therefore, our army has this heroic spirit of 'mission more important than life' and overcoming all difficulties, and has the great spirit of self-sacrifice for the benefit of the people, so we are invincible." Then, General Wang Zhen listed countless admirable heroic deeds. He cited an example: "For example, Comrade Huang Wenhua, he was from Sichuan and was oppressed in the Kuomintang army. He was liberated and joined our army in March last year during the Yichuan Campaign. This time, in the battle to annihilate the enemy's 76th Army in Yongfeng Town, south of Cheng County, when the first blasting team failed to complete its mission, at this critical moment, he voluntarily jumped out of the traffic trench, carried a box of explosives weighing more than 40 kilograms, and advanced through the enemy's dense artillery fire. Just as he reached the edge of the outer trench, the explosive box was hit by enemy bullets, and the comrades were extremely anxious. But in that instant, Comrade Huang Wenhua hugged the explosives and threw himself into the outer trench. With a loud bang, the enemy's outer trench was blown open, and he also sacrificed himself. The comrades stepped on the road he opened with his blood and rushed up. Comrade Huang Wenhua's proletarian heroic behavior, which was completely conscious and voluntary, and made a self-sacrifice for the purpose of eliminating the enemy and liberating all working people, is a glorious example of immortality for our working people. We must learn from him!" At this point, the entire audience shouted: People's heroes are immortal! Long live the People's Army! General Wang Zhen continued powerfully, "We must draw strength from these thousands of heroic deeds. We must not only carry forward the spirit of Comrade Huang Wenhua, but also learn from all our combat heroes! For example, the combat hero Comrade Du Lihai, who is present here, was liberated when the 135th Brigade was annihilated in the Yangmahe battle in northern Shaanxi in April 1947. Now he is a company commander. In May last year, in the resistance battle at Luojiaao, 25 miles north of Cheng County, he was a squad leader and led his entire squad to undertake the task of covering the transfer of troops. An enemy battalion repeatedly charged their fortified position three times but was repelled. At that time, he was shot several times in the abdomen and was seriously injured. At this time, the enemy suddenly inserted himself next to him, so he held soil in his mouth and lay in a pool of blood pretending to be dead. The enemy turned him over and over and pierced his clothes with bayonets, but he did not move at all. He finally deceived the enemy and crawled back to find the troops in the middle of the night. Later, he made great contributions in the Hutishan battle in the Huanglong Campaign. In the Yongfeng Town battle, he led his soldiers to capture the enemy commander Li Riji alive. Another example is Comrade Chen Zide, the communications squad leader. In the battle of Changban Town, Yongshou County in April last year, he encountered enemy stragglers on the way. Although he was injured, he still fought bravely against three enemies, twisted into a ball with the enemies, tore off the enemies' hair, and bit off the enemies' ears, and persisted until our troops caught up and finally captured the enemies. The spirit of Comrade Du Lihai and Chen Baide, etc., who overcome all difficulties and resolutely complete their tasks, is the guarantee for our army to win battles." General Wang Zhen also pointed out: "Many comrades in our army who came from poor backgrounds have raised their awareness through the movement to speak out about their suffering, and have developed infinite heroic spirit and the spirit of resolutely completing tasks. For example, Comrade Han Derong, in pursuit of the enemy, he was the first to rush to the enemy's fortifications, and his lower abdomen was blown open by artillery shells, and his intestines flowed out, but he held his intestines with his left hand and carried a grenade in his right hand, and continued to attack the enemy. At this time, he did not think about whether he could live, but only thought about how to complete the task, until he was exhausted and fell down. Before he died, he saw the instructor and asked: 'Have I completed my mission?' For example, Comrade Wang Zuoli, the head nurse of the health department, when a wounded soldier was carried down from the battlefield and needed to urinate immediately, but he did not have a urinal on hand, so he immediately used his mouth to suck out his urine, thus saving the comrade's life. Another example is Comrade Fan Shaotong, the special model worker and steward who is present here. He crawled around under enemy fire, year after year, delivering boiling water and rice bowl by bowl to the soldiers' mouths." General Wang Zhen said excitedly at this point: "The abundant new collective heroic spirit in our army is the foundation for our army to be invincible. Today, we swear before the portraits of Chairman Mao and Commander-in-Chief Zhu De that we will not be afraid of any difficulties and sacrifices, we will surely win, and we will always follow the truth that Chairman Mao said that communists who do not separate themselves from the masses will be invincible in the world."

　　解放军充沛英雄气概为人民而战无敌天下
    王震将军在陕中庆功会上演说
    【新华社西北十五日电】人民解放军西北野战军某部，于陕中前线某地举行该部一九四八年歼灭国民党匪军四万余众的庆功大会。数万军民在锣鼓声中庆祝七百余位人民功臣和该部的英雄事业。该部司令员王震将军在会上发表演说，他首先指出：“一九四八年的光辉胜利，乃是全体指战员艰苦奋斗、连续作战得来的，是许多为人民利益抱着自我牺牲伟大精神的同志们血肉的搏斗换来的，也是解放区成千成万的人民群众，热烈拥护军队，积极支援前线所取得的。”至此，王震将军领导全体军民肃立，向在战斗中英勇牺牲的烈士致敬，向七百余战斗英雄致敬。王震将军继称：“我们人民军队乃是历史上无与伦比的英雄式的队伍。我们过去踏雪山走草地，吃过树皮啃过草根，克服过各种困难，我们从未气馁。因为我们有毛泽东同志的思想作领导，我们与劳动人民结合在一起，就一定会得到胜利。毛泽东同志过去不论在任何困难的环境下，总是充满信心的告诉我们：‘同志们要胜利，要坚决地争取胜利，旧世界一定要打碎，新社会一定要在我们手里建立起来。’我们深受毛泽东同志的教育，我们是为毛泽东同志的这种崇高理想，为人民最大利益而作战的。因此，我们军队就有这种‘任务重于生命’的、排除万难的英雄气概，有为人民利益而自我牺牲的伟大精神，所以我们是无敌的。”于是王震将军列举了无数可歌可泣的英雄们的业迹。他举例说：“如黄文华同志，他是四川人，曾在国民党军队中受到压迫，去年三月在宜川战役中解放过来参加我军，此次在澄县南永丰镇消灭敌七十六军战斗中，当发起攻击的第一个爆炸组没完成任务时，在这紧急关头，他便自动地跃出交通道，抱起四十多斤重的一箱炸药，冒着敌人密集炮火前进，刚到外壕边，炸药箱被敌子弹击中了，同志们焦急万分。但在这一瞬间，黄文华同志抱住炸药扑向外壕，一声巨响，敌外壕被炸跨，他也牺牲了。同志们踏着他用血肉开辟的道路冲了上去。黄文华同志这种完全出于自觉自愿的、为了消灭敌人和解放全体劳动人民而作的自我牺牲的无产阶级式的英雄主义行为，是我们劳动人民千古不朽的光辉典范，我们要向他学习！”至此，全场高呼：人民英雄永垂不朽！人民军队万岁！王震将军继续有力地说：“我们要从这千千万万的英雄事迹中吸取力量，我们不但要发扬黄文华同志的精神，而且要向我们的一切战斗英雄们学习！如在座的战斗英雄杜立海同志，他是陕北一九四七年四月羊马河战斗消灭一三五旅时被解放的，现在已当了连长。去年五月在澄县北二十五里的罗家凹抗击战中，他是班长，率领全班担负掩护部队转移的任务。敌人一个营向他们坚守的阵地反复冲锋三次均被击退。当时他腹部数处中弹，伤势很重。这时敌人突然插到他身边，于是他口内含土，躺在血泊中装死。敌人把他翻过来翻过去，用刺刀挑破他的衣服，他一点不动弹。他终于骗过敌人，在半夜里爬回来找到部队。后来在黄龙战役的壶梯山战斗中又立了大功。在永丰镇大战中，他又带领战士活捉了敌军长李日基。又如通讯班长陈自德同志，在去年四月永寿县长坂镇战斗中，他在途中和敌人溃兵遭遇，他虽已负伤，但仍然力战三敌，和敌人扭成一团，撕下敌人的头发，咬下敌人的耳朵，一直坚持到我部队赶上来，终于俘虏了敌人。象杜立海和陈白德等同志这种排除万难、坚决完成任务的精神，这就是我军取得战斗胜利的保证。”王震将军又指出：“我军中许多贫苦出身的同志，他们经过诉苦运动，提高了觉悟，就发扬了无限的英雄气概和坚决完成任务的精神。如韩德荣同志，在追击敌人中，他第一个冲到敌人工事跟前，下腹被炮弹炸破，肠子流出来了，但他用左手按住肠子，用右手提着手榴弹，继续向敌人攻击。这时他没有想到自己能不能活，而只想到如何去完成任务，直到精疲力竭时才倒下来。临死前，他看到教导员时还问：‘我的任务完成没有？’如卫生部护士班长王作理同志，当一个伤员从战场上抬下来，需要立刻排尿，但他手边又没有排尿器，于是他便马上用嘴把他的尿吸出来，因而救活了那位同志。又如在座的特等模范工作者事务长范绍通同志，他在敌人炮火下爬来爬去，八年如一日，把开水和饭一碗一碗地送到战士们口边。”王震将军至此兴奋地说：“我军中这种充沛的新的集体的英雄主义精神，乃是我军所向无敌的基础。我们今天在毛主席朱德司令像前宣誓，我们一定不怕任何困难和牺牲，我们一定能胜利，我们永远遵循着毛主席所说的共产党人不脱离群众就会无敌于天下的真理。”
