    Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 4th: TASS, Pyongyang: The Second Session of the Supreme People's Assembly of Korea opened on January 28th at the Pyongyang Art Theater under the chairmanship of Kim Tu-bong, Chairman of the Presidium of the Assembly. Of the 572 deputies elected by the people of North and South Korea last August, 522 deputies attended the meeting. The conference unanimously adopted the following agenda: (1) On the results of the implementation of the 1948 plan for the restoration and development of the national economy, and the two-year plan for the restoration and development of the national economy for 1949-1950. (2) On the foreign policy of the Government of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea. (3) On the election of people's committees of local organs of state power at all levels - administrative units of provinces, cities, counties, townships and villages.
    Regarding the first item on the agenda, Jeong Jun-taek, Chairman of the State Planning Commission, reported to the conference that thanks to the patriotic labor of the working people and the assistance of the Soviet Union, the 1948 Korean national economic plan has been successfully completed and exceeded in all sectors of the national economy. The industrial production plan has been completed by 105.5 percent. Agricultural production increased by 40.6 percent compared to 1947. Railway transportation also completed the plan. Illiteracy among the people has been almost completely eliminated (according to statistics, there are 2.4 million illiterate people in North Korea). The People's Government pays great attention to public health. In 1948, nearly 2.5 million people received free treatment in hospitals and clinics. The successful completion of the 1948 plan laid a solid foundation for the further development of the national economy. Secondly, Jeong Jun-taek pointed out the tasks of the two-year plan, stating that the purpose of the two-year plan is to further develop the northern part of the republic, to finally eliminate the colonial nature of the national economy (this is the evil consequence left over from Japanese imperialism's rule), and to completely overcome its feudal backwardness. The plan stipulates that by the end of 1950, the total national industrial output will exceed the 1948 level by two times. The plan also stipulates measures to increase agricultural production, increase livestock, and develop transportation. National income will be greatly increased, especially the wages of workers and staff will be greatly increased. Compared with 1946, wages in 1950 will increase by 4.35 times. The two-year plan stipulates a number of measures to further improve public education and develop national culture. Universal compulsory education will be implemented in North Korea in 1950.
