Xinhua News Agency, Frontline of Pingjin, 31st—Generals Lin Biao, Commander of the People's Liberation Army on the Pingjin Front, and Luo Ronghuan, Political Commissar, sent a letter to General Fu Zuoyi on January 16th. The full text of the letter is as follows:

　　General Fu Zuoyi: You, General, accepted the so-called "suppression of bandits and pacification of the rebellion" pseudo-order from the reactionary Nanjing Kuomintang government and led your tens of thousands of reactionary troops to launch cruel offensives against the People's Liberation Areas and the People's Liberation Army in Suiyuan, Chahar, Hebei, Rehe, and northern Shanxi. You successively occupied Zhuozishan, Jining, Qingshuihe, Helingeer, Liangcheng, Fengzhen, Taolin, Xinghe, Shangdu, Shangyi, Zhangbei, Zhangjiakou, Xuanhua, Huailai, Zhuolu, Yangyuan, Weixian, Guangling, Tianzhen, Yanggao, Huairen, Zuoyun, Youyu, Shanyin, Yanqing, Longguan, Chongli, Chicheng, Guyuan, Kangbao, Baochang, Duolun, Huade, Laishui, Yixian, Wangdu, Wanxian, Hejian, Gaoyang, Renqiu, Anxin, Xiongxian, Xinzhen, Rongcheng, Suning, Lixian, Boye, Baxian, Yongqing, Guan, Anci, Shengfang, Gubeikou, Sanhe, Xianghe, Wuqing, Baodi, Ninghe, Yutian, Fengrun, Pinggu, Jixian, Zunhua, Xinglong, Qian'an, Lulong, Laoting, Changli, Funing, Chengde, Luanping, Fengning, Longhua, Pingquan, Qinglong, Lingyuan, Lingnan and other famous cities, important towns, county seats, and vast rural areas of the liberated areas. Wherever your troops went, they slaughtered the people, raped women, burned villages, and plundered property, using every means possible. In the areas under your control, you oppressed the broad masses of workers, farmers, soldiers, students, and merchants, demanding grain, taxes, and labor, squeezing them to the bone, for the so-called "pacification of the rebellion and suppression of bandits" by you, General, and your subordinates. Under the rule of you, General, and your subordinates, all freedoms and rights of the people were abolished, all democratic parties and people's organizations were suppressed, causing them to lose their legal status, and the patriotic movements of young students were suppressed. You, General, also ordered the destruction of public buildings and public supplies in Baoding, blew up the Luanhe Railway Bridge on the Beining Railway, leveled villages outside Beiping city, arrested innocent people inside Beiping city, felled scenic trees, and dismantled historical relics. The measures taken by you, General, and your subordinates in and around Tianjin city were also the same. Our army is ordered to launch a punitive expedition entirely to comfort the people and punish the guilty. You, General, dared not fight in the field, and led hundreds of thousands of troops to retreat into Pingjin, relying on the cities to resist, causing the people of both cities to suffer greatly. Our army has repeatedly notified you, General, and your subordinates to consider the lives and property of the millions of people in the two cities, the cultural relics of thousands of years, the light and heavy industries related to the future of the country, and the lives of your officers and soldiers, and has proposed two options: peaceful surrender or reorganization outside the city. In Tianjin, representatives of the Municipal Council went out of the city for negotiations, and our army immediately expressed its welcome. And suggested the following points: (1) Our army hopes for a peaceful resolution to avoid the destruction of Tianjin. (2) The Tianjin garrison should automatically lay down its arms and guarantee not to destroy public and private property, weapons, ammunition, and official documents. (3) Our army guarantees the safety of the lives and property of all officers and soldiers who automatically lay down their arms and their families. (4) If the garrison is unwilling to lay down its arms automatically and wants to resist to the end, our army will take offensive actions. On the day the city is breached, the reactionary leaders of the garrison will not be treated in the same way as enemy officers captured by our army in small cities and villages, but will be punished more severely. The representatives of the Municipal Council negotiated with the representatives of our army twice, but both were sabotaged by Chen Changjie, the commander of the Tianjin garrison, and Lin Weidou, the commander of the 62nd Army, resulting in no results. You, General, only at the last moment, ordered the Tianjin garrison to insist on the bandit leader Jiang Jieshi's pseudo-order to resist to the end. Our army, having no other choice, launched a general offensive at 10:00 am on the 14th of this month, and by 3:00 pm on the 15th, the battle was resolved, and more than 100,000 of your troops were disarmed, and the bandit leaders Chen Changjie, Lin Weidou, etc., were captured. This proves that the resistance of the garrison was of no use. Now Tianjin has been liberated, and the people have seen the light of day again, cheering and welcoming the People's Liberation Army. Beiping has been besieged for more than a month, and the people's suffering has been increasing. Our army has repeatedly postponed the attack time, hoping for a peaceful resolution, but to no avail. You, General, as a war criminal, if you still want to gain the understanding of the people and reduce the criminal responsibility you should bear as a war criminal, you should, at this last moment, follow the instructions of our army to redeem yourself. The methods are as follows: (1) Automatically lay down your arms and guarantee not to destroy cultural relics, not to kill revolutionary people, not to destroy public and private property, weapons, ammunition, and official documents. If you, General, and your subordinates can do these things, our army guarantees the safety of the lives and property of your officers and soldiers. Regarding your war crimes, there is also reason to explain the situation to the people, obtain the understanding of the people, and reduce or pardon them. (2) If you, General, and your subordinates are unwilling to lay down your arms automatically and are willing to leave the city for reorganization, our army can allow this for the sake of protecting Beiping from destruction. Our army can allow your army to leave Beiping and enter the designated location to be reorganized into the People's Liberation Army according to the system of the People's Liberation Army. The above two options are left to you, General, and your subordinates to choose freely. Our army is willing to give you, General, and your subordinates sufficient time to consider and prepare once again. This time is stipulated from 1:00 am on January 17, 1949, to 12:00 pm on January 21st. If you, General, and your subordinates dare to disregard the proposals of our army and want to sacrifice this ancient cultural city and the lives and property of two million citizens, and resolutely resist to the end, our army, in order to save this ancient city from being destroyed by you, General, and your subordinates, will carry out an attack on the city. During the attack on the city, our army will use precise tactics to focus the heaviest blows on those who dare to resist stubbornly; and will not strike at all those subordinates of yours who are unwilling to resist, and will treat them leniently. On the day the city is breached, you, General, and the reactionary leaders among your subordinates will be severely punished and will not be tolerated. Do not say that you were not warned. Lin Biao, Commander of the People's Liberation Army on the Pingjin Front, and Luo Ronghuan, Political Commissar, January 16, 1949.

　　This letter was handed over to General Fu Zuoyi's negotiating representatives, General Deng Baoshan and General Zhou Beifeng, in person at the headquarters of the People's Liberation Army on the Pingjin Front on January 16th. On the same day, General Deng Baoshan and General Lin Biao's representative entered the city for contact. General Fu Zuoyi immediately decided to accept the instructions of the People's Liberation Army and was willing to order his troops to leave the city to await reorganization into the People's Liberation Army. In the following days, after several contacts, some issues concerning the transition during the handover between the two sides were resolved. On the 21st, General Fu Zuoyi announced some (but not all) of the agreed points through the Kuomintang Central News Agency, and Fu's troops began to implement the agreement on the 22nd. By today (the 31st), the main force of Fu's troops had completed their movement, and the People's Liberation Army began to enter the city to take over the defense of Beiping. *

　　和平结束北平战事经过
    【新华社平津前线卅一日电】平津前线人民解放军司令员林彪将军政治委员罗荣桓将军于一月十六日曾以公函一件送给傅作义将军。该公函全文如下：
    傅作义将军：贵将军接受南京国民党反动政府所谓“剿匪戡乱”之伪令，率领所部数十万反动军队向着绥远、察哈尔、河北、热河及山西北部人民解放区和人民解放军发动残酷的进攻。先后攻占卓资山、集宁、清水河、和林格尔、凉城、丰镇、陶林、兴和、商都、尚义、张北、张家口、宣化、怀来、涿鹿、阳原、蔚县、广灵、天镇、阳高、怀仁、左云、右玉、山阴、延庆、龙关、崇礼、赤城、沽源、康保、宝昌、多伦、化德、涞水、易县、望都、完县、河间、高阳、任邱、安新、雄县、新镇、容城、肃宁、蠡县、博野、霸县、永清、固安、安次、胜芳、古北口、三河、香河、武清、宝坻、宁河、玉田、丰润、平谷、蓟县、遵化、兴隆、迁安、卢龙、乐亭、昌黎、抚宁、承德、滦平、丰宁、隆化、平泉、青龙、凌源、凌南诸解放区名城、重镇、县治及广大乡村。贵部军行所至，屠杀人民，奸淫妇女，焚毁村庄，掠夺财物，无所不用其极。在贵军管辖地区则压迫工、农、兵、学、商广大人民群众，出粮、出税、出力，敲骨及髓，以供贵将军及贵属所谓“戡乱剿匪”之用。在贵将军及贵属统治之下，取消人民的一切自由权利，压迫一切民主党派及人民团体使其丧失合法地位，压迫青年学生们的爱国运动。贵将军又复下令破坏保定公共建筑及公用物资，炸毁北宁路滦河铁桥，在北平城外平毁村庄，在北平城内逮捕无辜人民，斩伐风景林木，拆毁古迹材料。贵将军及贵属在天津城内外之措施，亦复如此。本军奉命征讨，全为吊民伐罪。贵将军不敢野战，率领数十万军队退入平津，据城抵抗，使两城人民受尽痛苦。本军迭次通知贵将军及贵属，顾念两城数百万人民之生命财产，数千年之文化古迹，国家前途所系之轻重工业及贵属官兵之身家性命，提出和平缴械或出城改编两项办法。天津方面，市参议会代表出城谈判，本军当即表示欢迎。并提示下列诸点：（一）本军甚望和平解决，以免天津遭受破坏。（二）天津守军应自动放下武器，并保障不破坏公私财产武器弹药及公文案卷。（三）本军保障一切自动放下武器之官兵个人及家属生命财产之安全。（四）如果守军不愿自动放下武器而欲抵抗到底，则本军将采取攻击行动。城破之日，守军方面诸反动领袖不能按照在小城市及乡村中作战时被本军所俘敌方军官一样待遇，而将加重其处罚。市参议会代表与本军代表谈判两次，均为天津城防司令陈长捷及六十二军军长林伟俦等所破坏，以致毫无结果。贵将军徒于最后时机，命令天津守军坚持匪首将介石伪令抵抗到底。本军迫不得已，乃于本月十四日上午十时，开始总攻，至十五日下午三时即解决战斗，贵部十余万人全被缴械，匪首陈长捷林伟俦等均被俘虏。足证守军之抵抗，毫无作用。现在天津业已解放，人民重见天日，欢声雷动，迎接人民解放军。北平被围业已月余，人民痛苦日益增重。本军一再推迟攻击时间，希望和平解决，至今未获结果。贵将军身为战争罪犯，如果尚欲获得人民谅解，减轻由战犯身份所应得之罪责，即在此最后时机，遵照本军指示，以求自赎。办法如下：（一）自动放下武器，并保证不破坏文化古迹，不杀戮革命人民，不破坏公私财产、武器弹药及公文案卷。如贵将军及贵属能够作到这些，则本军保证贵部官兵生命财产之安全。对于贵将军的战犯罪责，亦有理由向人民说明情况，取得人民谅解、予以减轻或赦免。（二）如果贵将军及贵属不愿意自动放下武器，而愿意离城改编，则本军为保全北平不受破坏起见，也可以允许这样作。本军可以允许贵军离开北平，开入指定地点，按照人民解放军的制度改编为人民解放军。上述两项办法，任凭贵将军及贵属自由选择。本军并愿再一次给予贵将军及贵属以考虑及准备之充分时间。此项时间，规定由一九四九年一月十七日上午一时起，至一月廿一日下午十二时止。如果贵将军及贵属竟敢悍然不顾本军的提议，欲以此文化古城及二百万市民生命财产为牺牲，坚决抵抗到底，则本军为挽救此古城免受贵将军及贵属毁灭起见，将实行攻城。攻城时，本军将用精确战术，使最重的打击落在敢于顽抗者身上；而对于不愿抵抗之贵属，则不给任何打击，并予以宽待。城破之日，贵将军及贵属诸反动首领，必将从严惩办，决不姑宽，勿谓言之不预。中国人民解放军平津前线司令员林彪政治委员罗荣桓一九四九年一月十六日。
    此公函系于一月十六日在人民解放军平津前线司令部当面交给傅作义将军的谈判代表邓宝珊将军和周北峰将军者。当日邓宝珊将军偕同林彪将军的代表入城联络。傅作义将军即决心接受人民解放军的指示，愿令其所部出城听候改编为人民解放军。此后数日，又经数度接洽，解决关于双方交接过渡期间的若干问题。傅作义将军于二十一日将协议诸点（但不完全）经国民党中央社公告，傅部即于二十二日开始履行协议。至本日（三十一日）傅部主力移动完毕，人民解放军开始入城接收北平防务。＊
