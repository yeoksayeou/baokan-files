The properties of manure are different, and it's important to know what kind of manure is good for which crop, and what kind is not, instead of applying manure indiscriminately.

　　(1) The strength of human manure and urine is mostly directed towards the leaves. For growing vegetables, apply more human manure. For cotton and melons, it's best not to apply or apply less human manure, because cotton is prone to excessive vegetative growth with too much human manure. Melons with too much human manure will have overly dense foliage, blocking sunlight and hindering fruit development. Applying human manure to tobacco is also not good.

　　(2) The strength of wood ash is directed towards the stalks and branches of crops, and it can also increase starch production. For wheat, beans, corn, potatoes, and yams, apply more wood ash.

　　(3) Cattle and sheep manure are cold in nature and have a slow-acting effect, making them best as base fertilizer. It is suitable for growing millet, wheat, and vegetables. But do not apply it to shaded land.

　　(4) Mule and horse manure is hot in nature and has a fast-acting effect. Regardless of the crop or soil type, mule and horse manure can be applied as base fertilizer.

　　(5) Pig manure is cold in nature and has a slow-acting effect. Do not apply pig manure to tobacco, but it can be used as base fertilizer for other crops.

　　(6) Kang (heated brick bed) soil is hot in nature and absorbs a lot of water, making it best for irrigated land. Apply less kang soil to cotton, wheat, eggplant, and beans. Applying kang soil to other crops is very good.

　　(7) There are several types of oilseed cakes, which need to be discussed separately: Cottonseed and hempseed cakes have a slow-acting effect. When sowing crops, it is best to sow them together with the seeds so they can exert their strength. If you apply them after the crops have grown, you need to ferment them first.

　　(8) Green manure (manure made from decomposed green grass) is suitable for all soil types and crops, and is best as a base fertilizer.

　　几种肥料的用法
    粪的性质不同，什么庄稼得知道上什么粪好，上什么粪不好，不能胡乱的上粪。
    （一）人粪和尿的劲头，多是向叶子上灌，种疏菜就要多上大粪。种棉花和瓜，最好别上大粪或少上大粪。因为棉花上了大粪，容易长疯杈。瓜上了大粪，叶子长的太稠密了，不透日光，也就不爱结瓜了。种烟施大粪也不好。
    （二）草木灰的劲头，是往庄稼秆和枝上灌，还能多生淀粉（就是团粉）；种麦子、豆子、棒子、山药蛋、山药，要多施草木灰。
    （三）牛羊粪性冷，是慢劲的，当底粪最好。种谷、麦、蔬菜都很合适；但不要往发阴的地里施。
    （四）骡马粪性热劲快，不论什么庄稼什么地性，都可施骡马粪当底粪。
    （五）猪粪性冷劲慢，种烟别上猪粪，种别的都可用猪粪当底粪。
    （六）炕土性热吸水多，水浇地用炕土最好。棉花、麦子、茄子、豆子等要少施炕土，别的庄稼上炕土都很好。
    （七）油饼有好几种，得分开来说：棉花籽的、大麻籽的，劲都挺慢，耩种庄稼时，最好和种子一块耩下去，才能施上劲。要是等庄稼长出来再施，就得发一发再施。
    （八）压绿肥（青草沤的粪），啥地性啥庄稼都合适，当底粪最好。
