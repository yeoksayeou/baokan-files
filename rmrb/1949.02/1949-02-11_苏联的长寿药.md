　　The Soviet Longevity Drug
    During the intense period of the Soviet-German War in World War II, a Soviet scientist named Bogomolets, after thirty years of research, finally invented a longevity drug. This can be said to be a significant achievement in science.
    Bogomolets examined the bodies of 30,000 people over the age of one hundred. He discovered a common characteristic in the bodies of so many elderly people: their connective tissue still retained the properties of young people. Connective tissue is all parts of our body except for the epidermis, muscle tissue, and nerve tissue, such as bones, the parts around blood vessels, and fatty tissue. These parts can produce and accumulate toxins, causing people to age slowly. The longevity drug can resist these toxins, stimulating those parts and restoring the disease resistance they had in youth.
    However, relying solely on this drug is not enough to achieve longevity. One must also pay attention to maintaining the body. People age easily, partly due to a lack of proper maintenance. For example, eating too much meat can easily cause gout and hardening of the arteries.
    According to Bogomolets' research, it takes twenty to twenty-one years for a person's bones to fully develop, so a person's proper lifespan should be one hundred twenty to one hundred fifty years.
    In recent years, in the Soviet Union, in addition to specialized "geriatric hospitals," general hospitals have also used the longevity drug to treat several patients, and it has been very effective. After using this drug, the white hair of a hundred-year-old can turn black, and the eyesight of those with blurred vision can be restored. The muscle and bone pain, headaches, insomnia, and other symptoms common in the elderly will also improve.
    Currently, although this longevity drug is widely used in the Soviet Union, its production requires a serum (serum is the yellowish liquid separated from blood when it clots). If large-scale manufacturing is desired, animal blood cannot be used entirely; it must be done using chemical methods. Large-scale manufacturing, based on the above situation, still faces difficulties. However, scientists believe that due to the Soviet government's emphasis on scientific research, this difficulty will be overcome quickly.

### 苏联的长寿药

　　苏联的长寿药
    在第二次世界大战中苏德战争正激烈的时候，一个名字叫做包戈莫乃兹的苏联科学家，经过三十年的研究，终于发明了一种长寿药。这在科学上，不能不说是一件极大的收获。
    包戈莫乃兹曾经检查过三万个一百岁以上的老人的身体，他在这么多的老人身体中，发现了一个共同的特点，就是他们身体里的结缔组织，还保存了年轻人的性质。结缔组织就是我们身体上，除了表皮组织，肌肉组织，和神经组织以外的各部分，如骨头、血管周围的部分及脂肪组织等都是。这些部分，能产生和蓄积毒素，使人慢慢衰老。长寿药就是可以抵抗这种毒素，使那些部分受到一种刺激，使青年时代所有的对疾病的抵抗力恢复起来。
    但是，单靠这种药，还不能就长寿，还得要注意保养身体。人容易衰老，没有很好的保养，也是其原因。比如吃肉太多，就容易引起痛风和血管变硬。
    根据包戈莫乃兹的研究，人的骨头长全要二十到二十一年，所以人的正当寿命应当是一百二十到一百五十年。
    几年来，在苏联，除了专门的“老衰医院”以外，一般的医院也用长寿药治了几个病人，都很见效。一百岁的老人，用这种药以后，白头发能变黑，眼睛昏花看不到东西的，眼力也能恢复，老年人常有的筋骨痛、头痛、失眠和其他病症，也会好了。
    到现在，这种长寿药在苏联虽说应用的已经很普遍，但这种药的做法是要一种血清（血清就是血在结成块时，面上分出来的黄水）。如果要大规模的制造，就不能全用动物的血来做，而要用化学方法来做。大规模的制造，照上述情形看，是还存在着困难的。然而科学家们都相信，由于苏联政府对科学研究工作的重视，这种困难将会很快地被克服。
