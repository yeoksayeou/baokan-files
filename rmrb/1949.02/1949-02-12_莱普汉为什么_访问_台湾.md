Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 10th. The mysterious trip of Lapham, director of the China branch of the U.S. Economic Cooperation Administration, and his deputy, Griffin, from Shanghai to Taiwan has aroused various speculations. During Lapham's visit to Taiwan, Chiang Kai-shek's confidants and veteran traitors, such as Weng Wenhao, Wang Shijie, Yu Dawei, and Huang Renlin, all gathered in Taiwan. According to an Associated Press report from Taipei on the 3rd of this month: Despite the shaky situation on the Chinese mainland (referring to the situation under Kuomintang rule), the ECA's Taiwan plan has been expanded, adding or preparing to add "irrigation afforestation," "fertilizer," and "railway" projects on top of the original aggressive investment plan. "The ECA Taiwan office expects that the engineering teams of the New York White Company and the Sino-American Railway Joint Committee will arrive in Taiwan soon." Why are the Americans so interested in Taiwan now? This is reminiscent of a news item in a Hong Kong newspaper on the 24th of last month. The news said that MacArthur had sent representatives to Taiwan to "prepare to annex this piece of Chinese territory" (according to the Associated Press Hong Kong dispatch on the same day). It is reported that Lapham and his party flew to Qingdao on the 6th after visiting Taiwan and met with Admiral Ramsey, commander of the U.S. Pacific Fleet, there.

　　莱普汉为什么“访问”台湾
    【新华社陕北十日电】美国经济合作总署中国分署署长莱普汉、副署长葛兰芬等自上海飞往台湾的神秘行动，引起了种种揣测。在莱普汉等一行访台期间，国民党匪首蒋介石的亲信卖国老手翁文灏、王世杰、俞大维、黄仁霖等不约而同地集中台湾。据本月三日美联社自台北报导：尽管中国本土的形势（指国民党统治的形势）摇摇欲坠，经合总署的台湾计划业已扩大，在原来侵略投资计划之上又增添了或准备增添“灌溉造林”、“肥料”及“铁路”等计划。“经合总署台湾办事处预料，纽约怀特公司和中美铁路联合委员会的工程队，不久即可到达台湾。”美国人为什么现在这样对台湾感到兴趣呢？这令人联想到上月二十四日香港报纸的一个消息。该消息称：麦克阿瑟已派代表至台湾活动，“准备吞并中国的这一块领土”（据同日美联社香港电）。按莱普汉等一行于访问台湾后已于六日飞青岛，并在该地与美国太平洋舰队总司令蓝姆赛会谈。
