Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, February 26th: A certain division of the Northeast People's Liberation Army stationed in the Pingjin area recently held a celebration rally to commend over two hundred people's heroes and eight model units for their contributions to the liberation of Tianjin. Before the assault, the cadres of the 3rd Company of a certain regiment personally led the assault teams to scout the terrain, select breakthrough points and assault routes, and designate firing targets. As a result, they successively completed four breakthrough missions without any casualties during the attack on the East Railway Station. After capturing the railway dormitory, the 1st Platoon of the company launched an attack on the fleeing enemy. More than two hundred enemies suddenly launched a counter-offensive against them. The platoon then bravely charged into the enemy ranks, continuously bayoneting more than ten enemies to death, forcing more than two hundred enemies to surrender. For this, the company was awarded a banner inscribed with "Integration of Bravery and Technique." In deep operations, the 8th Company of a certain regiment boldly cut and interspersed into the enemy camp. Squads and groups carried out encirclement maneuvers and fought bravely. The Zhang Tianjin squad of the 2nd Platoon knocked down three bunkers in one go, winning the banner of "Heroic and Tenacious." The 8th Company of another regiment lost contact with the battalion and regiment after entering the breach. The company quickly reorganized and, braving enemy flanking fire, boldly infiltrated. Under intense enemy artillery fire, they passed the Fazheng Bridge and annihilated an enemy battalion with less than two platoons. At the same time, every soldier in the company thoroughly observed the principle of not violating the people's property, and won a banner of "Heroic and Tenacious Policy Model." Celebration rallies are also being held one after another in other units of the Northeast Field Army.

　　东北某师奖励功臣
    【新华社北平二十六日电】驻平津地区的东北人民解放军某师近日举行庆功大会，嘉奖解放天津的二百多个人民功臣与八个模范单位。某团三连于实行冲锋前，连的干部都亲带突击队去看地形，选择突破点和冲锋道路，指定射击目标，因此在攻击东车站时，连续完成四次突破任务无一伤亡。攻占铁路宿舍后，该连一排正向逃窜之敌发起攻击，二百多敌人突然向他们展开反冲锋，该排随即勇猛杀入敌群，在连续刺死十多名敌人后，迫使二百余敌人全部缴枪，为此该连获得“英勇与技术结合”锦旗一面。某团八连在纵深作战中，大胆向敌营分割穿插，班和组都实行迂回包围，英勇作战，二班张天金小组，一气打下三个地堡，荣获“英勇顽强”锦旗一面。另一个团的第八连，在进入突破口后，与营团失掉联系，该连迅速整顿了组织，就冒着敌人侧射的火力，大胆渗透，在敌密集炮火下通过法政桥，又以不到两个排的兵力，全歼敌一个营；同时，该连每一战士都彻底做到了秋毫无犯，获得“英勇顽强政策榜样”锦旗一面。东野其他各队的庆功大会，亦正纷纷先后举行。
