　　Beiping Workers, With a Master's Attitude, Actively Assist in Takeover Work
　　【Beiping Electric】 The broad masses of workers in Beiping, with the attitude of masters, assisted in the takeover work, contributing public materials they had stored, and ensuring the smooth progress of the takeover and resumption of work. Representatives of workers from the six plants of the Shijingshan Iron and Steel Plant, including iron smelting, coking, casting, power, machine repair, and chemical industry, as well as the general affairs and engineering departments, participated in the inventory work led by the takeover team, investigated all lost, omitted, damaged, and concealed materials and equipment, and achieved good results. Workers of the Mentougou Coal Mine Company recommended Dong Sexiang, Mao Shuduo, Wang Zhongli, and Li Laifeng to participate in the Industrial and Mining Management Committee, assist in the takeover, and lead production. Yang Baosong, Shi Fu, Lu Shilin, and other workers from the Changxindian Railway Machinery Factory and Locomotive Depot have contributed 12 sets of brake handles for locomotives, a scale, a telephone, and telegraph equipment, iron pipes, and other items. During the war, most of the items from the North China Agricultural Experiment Field's Nanpu Tang and Beipu Field, which belonged to the Baixiang'an in the western suburbs of Beiping, were lost. The workers automatically went to the people to investigate and said that they had recovered more than 400 large and small items. Sun Wenzhang, a worker at the Nanyuan Substation of the Jibei Electric Power Company, contributed a complete set of measuring instruments that he had hidden at home for many years for public use. On the eve of the Japanese surrender, he and a Japanese named Xida went on a business trip to Zhangdian. On the way back, the Japanese surrendered. Xida wanted to sell the complete set of measuring instruments he was carrying. Sun Wenzhang bought the measuring instruments with 5,000 yuan of puppet Allied banknotes and stored them until today. On the 14th of this month, the work team of the Jibei Electric Power Company invited employees to hold a forum. Sun Wenzhang excitedly reported the source of the measuring instruments and said: "I didn't give this measuring instrument to the Kuomintang when they were taking over. Now that we are liberated, the workers and the Communist Party are one family. This kind of thing is very scarce, so I want to take it out for our own use. I would rather leave it idle than give it to the Kuomintang before."
