　　Xinhua News Agency, Shenyang, 5th: Mr. Feng Yufang, who passed away on January 27th, was born in Hainan Island in 1883. In 1905, he joined the Tongmenghui, the revolutionary organization led by Mr. Sun Yat-sen at the time, in Japan, and participated in the revolutionary movement against the Manchu Qing Dynasty. Three years after the failure of the 1911 Revolution, Mr. Sun Yat-sen founded the Chinese Revolutionary Party in Japan, and Mr. Feng served as the head of the party's Tokyo branch. Between 1918 and 1934, Mr. Feng was active in Guangdong, Siam, Malaya, London, Batavia, Hong Kong and other places. Around 1934, Mr. Feng co-founded the New Script Society with Mr. Hu Yuzhi, Mr. Zhang Yi＠ and others in Hong Kong, serving as its president and engaging in new cultural activities. From 1937, he went to Hankou and served as a design committee member of the Political Department of the Military Affairs Commission of the Kuomintang government, which was attended by progressive elements at the time. In 1938, Mr. Feng returned to Hong Kong, continued to work on new scripts, and served as a professor of political economy at Nanhua College. After the fall of Hong Kong in 1941, Mr. Feng was arrested by the Japanese Kou to a concentration camp for assisting overseas Chinese in Hong Kong to return to China, and suffered abuse from the Japanese Kou, which damaged his health. Soon after, he escaped to Macau to recuperate. After the Japanese Kou surrendered in 1945, Mr. Feng returned to Hong Kong and served as the chairman of the Hong Kong and Kowloon branch of the China Democratic League. Mr. Feng, who yearned for democracy and freedom, disregarded his old age, illness and the hardship of the journey, and left Hong Kong on November 20th last year to come to the Northeast Liberated Area. In mid-December last year, Mr. Feng's lung disease and asthma relapsed, and all treatments were ineffective. He passed away on the evening of January 27th this year at the age of 66.
