    Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, February 21st: TASS, The Hague, February 17th: Recent news from Yogyakarta states that Indonesian forces are attacking Dutch military positions in Yogyakarta and other areas of Java. "Sin Po" reported that, according to a dispatch from its reporter after meeting with a certain guerrilla detachment, the guerrillas in the Parasan area are prepared for a protracted struggle. The newspaper "De Waarheid" wrote that the de Drees government must not stifle the fighting spirit of the Indonesian people who are determined to fight for freedom. Guerrilla warfare is just beginning. The Dutch army is suffering heavy losses every day, and its morale is declining daily.
    Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, February 21st: Điện Tín Agency, The Hague, February 18th: Dutch government officials announced today that Indonesian President Sukarno and Indonesian traitor Premier Hatta, who are currently imprisoned on Bangka Island, Indonesia, will be released in the near future. They were detained two months ago during a surprise attack on Yogyakarta by Dutch colonial troops. Dutch government officials said that the Indonesian "leaders" will be free to move around in Java, but are "prohibited from engaging in political activities." The Dutch government's new actions were taken after the imprisoned "leaders" spoke with the United Nations Indonesia Committee's Three-Member Committee.

　　印尼游击队进攻日惹等地
  　准备作长期斗争
    【新华社陕北二十一日电】塔斯社海牙十七日讯：最近来自日惹的消息称：印尼部队正在进攻日惹与爪哇其他地区的荷军阵地。“新报”报道，根据该报记者在会见某游击支队之后发表的通讯称：在帕拉散斯地区，游击队已准备作长期斗争。“德·瓦尔海”报写道：德里斯政府绝不能扼死决心为自由而斗争的印尼人民的战斗精神。游击战还只是开始。荷军每日都要受很大的损失，其士气正日益低落。
    【新华社陕北二十一日电】电通社海牙十八日讯：荷兰政府人士今日宣布：现在被监禁在印尼邦加岛上的，印尼总统苏加诺和印奸总理哈达等，将于短期内获释。他们是在荷兰殖民军队两月前突袭日惹时被拘留的。荷兰政府人士说，印尼“领袖”们将在爪哇自由行动，但“禁止从事政治活动”。荷兰政府的新行动是在被监禁的“领袖”们与联合国印尼委员会三委员会谈后所采取的。
