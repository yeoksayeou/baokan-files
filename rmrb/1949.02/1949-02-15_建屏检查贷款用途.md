　　Jianping Checks Loan Usage
    [North Yue News] Jianping County Promotion Cooperative reviewed last year's agricultural loan work and put forward suggestions for improvement in the future. Last year, the government allocated 0.2% of the county's public grain and 367.2 million Border Region currency to the Promotion Cooperative to support mass production. However, the effect was not very significant. The main shortcomings were as follows: (1) The phenomenon of various grain and currency loans not being used for production was widespread. For example, for livestock loans, 484 households borrowed a total of 1,332,495 catties of grain and 142.73 million Border Region currency, which could have purchased 484 head of livestock, but only 236 head of livestock were actually added. For example, in Heishan Kou in the first district, 884 catties of grain were borrowed, but not a single head of livestock was purchased. (2) The lending of grain and currency did not focus on production and displayed a simple poor peasant perspective, forming a simple relief perspective. (3) Loans were not based on the needs of the masses' production undertakings, and there was a phenomenon of equal distribution by village and household. For example, Han Shuiquan in Xiamachuan in the fifth district borrowed 70 catties of grain in eight installments, with some installments as low as three catties. There were many such villages. Due to the above deviations, the loan did not play its due role in supporting production. At the same time, the loan also failed to preserve its principal. Out of 210 million in loans, 150 shi of millet were lost. The reason for the above deviations was mainly that the leadership did not take responsibility. In the future, it must be done: the leadership must have specific control, loans must be focused and cannot be distributed equally; establish a production perspective, and the use and object of the loan must be checked regularly, and problems must be discovered and corrected in a timely manner; educate farmers regularly to explain the loan policy, borrow and repay, to achieve the greatest possible effect of supporting production.

　　建屏检查贷款用途
    【北岳讯】建屏县推进社，检讨去年农贷工作，并提出今后改进意见。去年政府拿出全县百分之点二公粮和三亿六千七百二十万边币交给推进社扶持群众生产，但起的作用不很大，其主要有以下缺点：（一）各种贷粮贷款普遍发生未用于生产的情形，如牲口贷款四八四户，共贷粮一百三十三万二千四百九十五斤，边币一亿四千二百七十三万元，可买牲口四八四头，但实际只增牲口二百三十六头。如一区黑山口贷粮八八四斤，一个牲口也没买下。（二）贷粮款不从生产着眼，有单纯贫农观点的现象，形成单纯救济观点。（三）贷款没有根据群众生产事业的需要，有按村按户的平分现象，如五区下马串韩水全八次贷粮七十斤。一次有贷三斤的时候。这样的村子还不少。由于以上的偏向，以致使贷款没有起到他应有的扶持生产的作用；同时贷款也没能保住本，二亿一千万贷款中，即赔小米一百五十石。产生以上偏向的原因，主要是领导没有负起责任。今后必须做到：领导具体掌握，贷款必须要有重点，不能平均分配；建立生产观点，必须经常检查贷款的用途和对象，及时发现问题及时纠正；经常教育农民说明贷款政策，有借有还，以达到最大效能的扶助生产作用。
