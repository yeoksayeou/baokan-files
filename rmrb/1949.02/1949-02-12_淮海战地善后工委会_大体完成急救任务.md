　　Xinhua News Agency, Central Plains, 10th. The disaster areas of Xiao County, Su County, and Xuefeng (i.e., Yongcheng), which were devastated and ravaged by Du Yuming's bandit troops, have been the focus of intensive work by the Battlefield Rehabilitation Work Committee. The emergency relief task has been largely completed. The Henan-Anhui-Jiangsu Administrative Office has allocated a total of 15 million catties of relief grain, of which 5 million catties were used to aid disaster victims in Su County, Mengcheng, and Huaiyuan areas, and 10 million catties were used to aid disaster areas in Xiao County, Su County, and Xuefeng. The first batch of 2 million catties of emergency relief grain has been transported to various villages and distributed according to the severity and urgency of the disaster. According to preliminary statistics from six townships in the Liuhe District of Xuefeng County, which suffered the most from Du's bandits' ravages, the number of people killed and injured by Du's bandits reached 528, 5,778 houses were completely destroyed, and 1,493 were partially destroyed. Grain, livestock, pigs, sheep, chickens, and ducks were almost completely looted and eaten by the bandit troops, leaving the masses with no means of livelihood upon returning home. On the third day after the victory of the campaign (January 12), the district universally distributed grain for emergency relief based on the disaster situation. Appraisers were selected from each village, and the masses reported and discussed the situation publicly. Severely affected households received 50 catties of grain per person, first-class disaster households received 25 catties, and lightly affected households received 12 catties. By the 16th, a total of 559,775 catties of emergency relief grain had been distributed, and more than 15,000 starving disaster victims had been rescued. Now the government has begun to organize the masses to produce and help themselves, using 8 million catties of grain to help the people in the disaster areas of Xiao County, Su County, and Xuefeng solve the difficulties in production such as livestock, seeds, and farm tools, so that the vast number of disaster victims can resume production and rebuild their homes. Many disaster victims who were rescued from the brink of death in the area have accused the Kuomintang bandit troops of their crimes to the government, demanding resolute punishment of war criminals to avenge the people. In addition, the work of burying enemy corpses and accommodating the wounded and captured was largely completed on the 16th of last month. Among the large number of enemy corpses buried was Qiu Qingquan, commander of the bandit's Second Army Corps, who was buried by the People's Liberation Army near Jiang Xinlou Village, Zhang Datun Village, Xiao County. In addition, more than 9,600 wounded enemy soldiers were accommodated. They were extremely grateful for the accommodation and treatment they received from the People's Government. Some lightly wounded soldiers automatically helped the People's Liberation Army search for the enemy's hidden military supplies and weapons. Many technical personnel, such as military doctors and artillerymen, requested to join the People's Liberation Army to serve the people after they recovered from their injuries.
