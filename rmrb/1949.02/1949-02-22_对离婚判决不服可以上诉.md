　　Appealing Against Divorce Judgments is Permitted

Editor:

　　My name is Wang Jinxi, and I live in Weikang South Village. After marrying at the age of fifteen, my relationship with my wife has always been harmonious. Last September, we had a quarrel over fetching water, and my wife filed for divorce. The county government ruled that we could divorce, and I am very dissatisfied with this judgment. I would like to ask if a minor squabble can be grounds for divorce? Please advise!
    　　　　　Wang Jinxi

    Answer: According to you, your relationship with your wife was good in the past, and it was a temporary conflict and disagreement that led to the wife filing for divorce. Now that a divorce has been granted, if you are dissatisfied with the judgment, you can appeal to the second instance judicial authority. However, the main thing is whether the woman can restore her feelings for you. If the woman insists on a divorce, the second instance will not rule against it.

　　对离婚判决不服可以上诉编辑同志：
    我叫王金喜，家居魏康南村，十五岁结婚后，夫妻感情一直很融洽。去年九月，因打水发生口角，我妻便提出离婚，经县府判决可以离，我对这样的判决很不服气。请问是否能因一点小争吵嘴就成为离婚的理由？请解答！
    　　　　　王金喜
    答：据你说，你夫妻过去感情很好，是一时冲突，闹意见，女方提出离婚。现在判决离婚了，你对判决不服，可以到第二审司法机关上诉。但主要看女方能否对你恢复感情，如女方一定要离婚，第二审也不会判决不准离的。
