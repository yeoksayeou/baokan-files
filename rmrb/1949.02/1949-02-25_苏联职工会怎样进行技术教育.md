In a workshop of the "Red Proletarian" lathe manufacturing factory in Moscow, many new workers have been added. They graduated from the production training courses organized by the factory management, and therefore were able to work independently on the lathes. However, the labor productivity of many of them is not high, lagging far behind the old workers. Some novices cannot even complete the manufacturing quota. In view of this, it was decided to organize various study groups to improve the technical knowledge of the new workers, teaching them cutting methods and how to use drawings, led by the engineers of the workshop.

At the same time, the workshop trade union committee convened a group of Stakhanovite movement participants to discuss how to teach their work experience to the new workers, and decided to establish some Stakhanovite schools to train new workers, with the Stakhanovite movement participants themselves responsible for leading these schools.

Experience has proven that this approach is successful. The knowledge gained by young workers in the technical knowledge improvement groups is consolidated in the Stakhanovite school practice, and then labor productivity improves rapidly.

The method of the best Stakhanovite movement participants imparting work experience to new and lagging workers is being implemented by all Soviet trade unions, playing a significant role in the development of the socialist competition, in promoting the Stakhanovite movement, and in the overall increase of labor productivity in Soviet industry. However, Soviet trade unions are doing far more than this in spreading technical knowledge, especially the trade union clubs, red corners, libraries, cinemas, radio stations, and specialized technical rooms, which are doing a great deal of work in spreading technology.

First of all, we must point out the lecturing work of the trade unions. For example, in Leningrad, the technical office of the Vyborzhsky District Cultural Palace systematically sets up lectures and reports on new metal cold casting methods, improved welding methods, the use of the latest tools, etc. The lectures are given by factory engineers who have already adopted these new technologies. Often these lectures turn into meetings for exchanging technical experiences.

Similar work is carried out in the trade union clubs and "red corners" of many Soviet enterprises. The topics of the lectures and reports are varied, but as a rule, they are extremely timely.

In addition to lecturing, clubs and technical offices also organize technical advisory offices, technical exhibitions, and hold production evening parties for veteran production personnel and outstanding Stakhanovite movement participants to exchange experiences. In addition, they hold talks between new and old workers, talks between workers and representatives of the scientific community, engineers and designers, as well as meetings of veteran production personnel and meetings of workers in the same trade. The club premises are equipped with socialist competition bulletin boards, photo columns of outstanding production personnel, production sample display windows, observation meetings of the work of Stakhanovite movement participants, rationalization movement participants and researchers, slogans, pictures, models and other items indicating how to treat production equipment, how to save fuel, electricity, tools and materials.

The factory trade union library publicizes and recommends technical books to readers, posts introductory catalogs of popular technical books, introduces new books, holds book exhibitions, and helps inventors, rationalization movement participants and new workers select books. The trade union cinema holds screenings and discussions of technical films, and the trade union radio station holds broadcasts on current issues in production life, publicizes the achievements of advanced elements in socialist competition, and broadcasts reports on current technical issues.

For example, the editorial department of the Ural Automobile Factory radio station broadcasts materials on these issues in such an orderly manner as: "Lectures on the Experience of Stakhanovite Movement Participants," "Technical Bulletin," "Work Instructions," etc. Standing in front of the loudspeakers of the trade union radio station are: Stakhanovite movement participants, work team leaders, technicians, engineers, rationalization movement participants, inventors, and advanced elements in socialist competition.

Among the various technical propaganda methods adopted by the trade union organization, it is necessary to point out the holding of production visits to understand the work of advanced factories, and holding discussions with Stakhanovite movement participants, rationalization movement participants and inventors from various factories to exchange work experience.

It is also of great significance that the trade union organization actively participates in the formulation of plans and outlines for training and cultivating cadres responsible by the factory administration, and implements daily public supervision to ensure that these plans and outlines are realized. The trade union organization ensures that all production cadres receive training and improve their skills, pays attention to absorbing outstanding engineering and technical talents to engage in this work, and cooperates with the administration to help their work by organizing learning, answering questions, and supplying books.

Such are the technical publicity methods and methods adopted by the Soviet trade unions. Their activities in this area have played a great role in improving the technical and cultural level of the broad masses of workers. Now, as the Soviet people are mobilizing their forces to complete the post-war five-year plan for the restoration and development of the national economy ahead of schedule, the technical propaganda work carried out by the Soviet trade unions is of even greater significance.

　　苏联职工会怎样进行技术教育
    在莫斯科“红色无产阶级”车床制造工厂的一个车间里，新增加了很多新的工人，他们从工厂管理当局组织的生产训练班毕业，因此才得以独立在车床上工作。但是，其中很多人的劳动生产率还不高，大大落后于老工人，有一部分新手甚至不能完成制造定额，有鉴于此，曾决定组织提高新工人技术知识的各种学习小组。给他们教授截割方法和如何用图这些课材，由车间的工程师领导学习。
    与此同时，车间职工委员会召集了斯达汉诺夫运动者的小组，和他们谈了谈把各自工作经验教给新手的问题，决定建立一些斯达汉诺夫学校以训练新工人，斯达汉诺夫运动者自己负责领导这些学校。
    经验证明了这样做是成功的，青年工人由提高技术知识小组中获得的知识，在斯达汉诺夫学校的实习中得到巩固，于是劳动生产率迅速提高了。
    最好的斯达汉诺夫运动者传授工作经验给新手和落后工人这一办法，苏联一切职工会都在实行，在发展社会主义竞赛中，在推广斯达汉诺夫运动中，在苏联工业劳动生产力的总高涨中，都起着重大作用。但是，苏联职工会在传播技术知识这件事情上所做的远比这一办法还要广而多，特别是职工会俱乐部、红角、图书馆、电影院、广播电站及专门技术室，在传播技术方面是做着巨大工作的。
    首先必须指出职工会的讲授工作。例如，在列宁格勒，韦波尔格区文化宫的技术室有系统地设立关于新式金属冷的铸造法、改良焊接法，最新工具使用法等等讲座与报告。讲座是由自己已经采用这些新式技术的工厂工程师担当。常常这些讲座变成交流技术经验的会议。
    在许多苏联企业的职工会俱乐部和“红角”中都进行此类工作，讲座与报告的题材是各式各样，但照例都是极应时的。
    除讲授工作外，俱乐部与技术室还组织技术顾问处、技术展览会，举行生产晚会以供老生产人员与优秀斯达汉诺夫运动者交换经验，此外还举行新老工人的会谈，工人与科学界代表，工程师和设计家的会谈，以及举行老生产人员会议和同业工人会议等等。俱乐部房舍中设有社会主义竞赛布告板、优秀生产人员照片栏、生产样品陈列窗，斯达汉诺夫运动者、合理化运动者与研究者的工作观摩会，表明应如何对待生产设备，如何节省燃料、电力、工具和材料的标语画、像片、模型以及其它。
    工厂的职工会图书馆向读者宣传和推荐技术书籍，挂出通俗技术书籍的介绍目录，介绍新书，举办书籍展览，帮助发明家、合理化运动者和新工人挑选书籍。职工会电影院举行放映和技术影片的讨论，职工会广播电站则举办关于生产生活中的应时问题的广播，宣传社会主义竞赛先进分子的成就，播送目前技术问题的报告。
    举例说，乌拉尔汽车工厂广播电站编辑部就是这样有次序地播送这些问题的材料：“斯达汉诺夫运动者经验讲座”、“技术通报”、“工作须知”等等，在职工会广播电站的扩音器前站着讲话的有：斯达汉诺夫运动者、工作班长、技匠、工程师、合理化运动者、发明家和社会主义竞赛先进分子。
    在职工会组织采用的各种技术宣传方式中，必须指出的还有举行生产参观，以了解先进工厂工作，及与各厂斯达汉诺夫运动者、合理化运动者和发明家举行座谈，以资交换工作经验这两种方式。
    职工会组织积极参加拟制工厂行政方面所负责的训练培养干部计划及纲要，并实行日常的公众监督使这些计划及纲要得以实现，这点也有很重要的意义。职工会组织做到使所有生产干部都能获得训练和提高技术，注意吸收优秀的工程技术人才去从事这种工作，并协同行政方面用组织学习、解答疑问、供应书籍等方法帮助他们的工作。
    苏联职工会所采用的技术宣传方式和方法就是这样。他们这一方面的活动，在提高广大工人群众技术文化水平事业上起了很大作用，现在，正当苏联人民为提前完成复兴和发展国民经济的战后五年计划而动员其力量之际，苏联职工会进行的技术宣传工作，其意义就更增大了。
