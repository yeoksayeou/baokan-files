Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 6th: Tokyo dispatch: On January 28th, the Japanese Communist Party proposed the formation of a People's Democratic Front to the Socialist Party and the Labor-Farmer Party. This proposal, comprising thirteen points, was submitted to the headquarters of the Socialist Party and the Labor-Farmer Party by Japanese Communist Party representatives Ritsu Ito, Katsumi Kikunami, Kazuyoshi Tsuchibashi, Kairu Hosokawa, and Okujiro Konno. It reflects the urgent demands of the Japanese working people, namely: to oppose unjustified dismissal of workers, to oppose revisions to labor laws that are unfavorable to workers, to improve working conditions, to oppose oppressive agricultural taxes, to reform the land system, to abolish income tax for working people, to oppose bloated budgets, to unconditionally unite on a large scale within the worker-peasant camp, and to conclude a peace treaty as soon as possible. On January 30th, the upper leadership of the Japanese Socialist Party, the Central Executive Committee, headed by the infamous Katayama Tetsu, passed a resolution rejecting the Japanese Communist Party's proposal. This resolution violates both the will of the Japanese working people and the will of the Socialist Party's rank and file. On February 1st, Socialists in Hokkaido, at a representative meeting of the Socialist Party, Labor-Farmer Party, the Federation of Industrial Labor Unions, and other labor organizations held in Sapporo, disregarded the reactionary resolution of the Socialist Party headquarters and agreed to form a united front with the Communist Party. The Federation of Industrial Labor Unions, which unites a large number of organized workers, also issued a statement at the end of January, resolutely demanding the formation of a united front of representatives from the Communist Party, the Labor-Farmer Party, and the Socialist Party in the Diet, and calling on them to safeguard the interests of the working people.

　　日共提出组织联合阵线
  　各劳工组织表示赞成
    片山哲拒绝联合引起下层不满
    【新华社陕北六日电】东京讯：日本共产党于一月二十八日向社会党与工农党提出组织人民民主阵线的建议。这个包括十三点内容的建议，是由日共代表伊藤律、听涛克已、土桥一吉、细川贝路、绀野奥次郎提交社会党和工农党的总部的。它反映着日本劳动人民的迫切要求；即：反对无理解雇工人，反对对劳工法作不利于工人的修改，改善工作条件；反对苛捐的农业税，改革土地制度，废除劳动人民的所得税，反对庞大预算，工农阵营方面大规模无条件地团结和及早缔结和约等。一月三十日，以臭名远扬的片山哲为首的日本社会党上层领导机关——中央执行委员会，通过了拒绝日共建议的决议。这一决议既违背了日本劳动人民的意志，又违背了社会党下层党员群众的意志。二月一日，北海道的社会党人，在札幌举行的社会党、工农党、产业劳动组合联合会及其他劳工组织的代表会议上，蔑视社会党总部的反动决议，同意与共产党组织联合阵线。团结了广大的有组织工人的产业劳动组合联合会，也于一月底发表声明，坚决要求在议会中结成共产党、工农党、社会党代表的统一战线，并呼吁他们维护劳动人民的利益。
