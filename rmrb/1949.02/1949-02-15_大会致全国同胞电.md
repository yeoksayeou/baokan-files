　　Message from the Conference to Compatriots Across the Country
    [Xinhua News Agency, Beiping, 13th] The Beiping All-Circles Celebration of Liberation Conference sent a telegram to compatriots across the country, stating: To all compatriots across the country: Beiping has been liberated! A fortress of feudal rule for hundreds of years has been destroyed! We, the more than two million people of Beiping, feel infinite glory and the joy of liberation. Beiping has become the people's Beiping! This is one of the most important achievements in the great Chinese People's Democratic Revolutionary Movement. We hope that compatriots across the country can also quickly break free from the counter-revolutionary rule of the Kuomintang reactionaries and, like us, embark on the bright path of liberation. The liberation of Beiping once again proves that the power of the Chinese people and the Chinese People's Liberation Army under the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party is unparalleled. The peaceful resolution of the Beiping issue provides an example for other cities under the rule of the Kuomintang government: that is, to implement Chairman Mao's eight peace conditions in the best way. The Kuomintang army led by General Fu Zuoyi has withdrawn from the city to designated locations and, in accordance with democratic principles, is awaiting reorganization into the People's Liberation Army. The Kuomintang counter-revolutionary political institutions in Beiping City have been destroyed, the people's democratic government is being established, and the democratic rights of the people are fully guaranteed. Facts prove that all officers and soldiers of the Kuomintang army who are unwilling to continue to be enemies of the people and unwilling to continue to work for the Four Big Families, as long as they sincerely accept the eight peace conditions proposed by Chairman Mao, abandon darkness and turn to the cause beneficial to the people, will be welcomed by the people. Even war criminals among them can be allowed to atone for their crimes. This is the correct policy for the Chinese people to achieve true democratic peace. But now, the Kuomintang reactionaries, under the command of American imperialism, are still playing with peace conspiracies, attempting to deceive the people, divide the national democratic forces, in order to cover up their military redeployment and continue the anti-people war. We warn this group of reactionaries: the eyes of the people are discerning, we have long seen through your conspiracy, and we will definitely smash it. What the Chinese people need is true peace, and we resolutely support Chairman Mao's eight conditions. We believe that only by realizing these eight conditions can there be true democratic peace.
    Compatriots across the country, we must unite and act together, under the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party and Chairman Mao, resolutely oppose the fake peace plotted by American imperialism and the Kuomintang reactionaries, strive for true democratic peace, and fight for the construction of a New Democratic China.

　　大会致全国同胞电
    【新华社北平十三日电】北平各界庆祝解放大会致全国各界同胞通电称：全国各界同胞公鉴：北平解放了，一个数百年来封建统治的堡垒被摧毁了，我们北平二百余万人民，感到无限的光荣和被解放的喜悦。北平已经成为人民的北平了！这是伟大的中国人民民主革命运动中最重要的成就之一。我们希望全国同胞也能够很快地摆脱国民党反动派的反革命统治，和我们一样地走上光明解放的道路。北平的解放，再一次证明了在中国共产党领导下的中国人民和中国人民解放军的力量是无比的强大。北平问题的和平解决，向国民党政府统治下的其他城市提供了一个范例：这就是执行毛主席八项和平条件最好的方式。傅作义将军所率领的国民党军队，已经开出城外指定的地点，按照民主原则，听候改编为人民解放军。北平市的国民党反革命的政权机构已被摧毁，人民民主政权正在建立，人民大众的民主权利得到充分的保障。事实证明一切不愿继续与人民为敌，不愿继续替四大家族卖命的国民党军队的官兵，只要诚意接受毛主席所提出的八项和平条件，弃暗投明，转向有利于人民的事业，人民是欢迎的。就是对于其中的战犯，也可以允许他们将功赎罪。这就是中国人民实现真正民主和平的正确方针。但是现在国民党反动派却还在美帝国主义指挥下，玩弄和平阴谋，企图欺骗人民，分化全国民主力量，以掩护它在军事上的重新部署，继续反人民的战争。我们警告这批反动派：人民的眼睛是雪亮的，我们早已看清你们的阴谋，我们一定要粉碎它的。中国人民所需要的是真和平，我们坚决拥护毛主席的八项条件。我们认为只有实现这八项条件，才有真正的民主的和平。
    全国同胞们，我们要一致团结和行动起来，在中国共产党和毛主席的领导下，坚决反对美帝国主义和国民党反动派所策动的假和平，争取真正的民主的和平，为建设新民主主义的中国而奋斗。
