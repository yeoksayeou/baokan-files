Xinhua News Agency, Jinan, 24th – The Jinan City Wang Chuntian Transportation Brigade, consisting of more than four hundred people and two hundred and sixty-two flatbed carts, transferred more than 26,000 tons of military grain in November and December of last year, completing approximately seven-tenths of the military grain transport task within the city during the Huaihai Campaign. This transportation brigade developed from an initial group of three people pulling military grain. It went through a struggle against the sabotage of the guild and has now formed the Eleventh District Transportation Workers Cooperative on the basis of the team. In Jinan City under Kuomintang rule, feudal guilds were very common among transportation workers. The heads of the guilds colluded with the Kuomintang and factory owners to exploit and oppress the workers. After liberation, the guild heads opposed the workers organizing themselves. During the Huaihai Campaign, Wang Chuntian and the current deputy brigade leader Wang Ruinian participated in transporting public grain, making eight round trips a day and earning 24,000 yuan. This motivated everyone to organize themselves. They felt that working for state-owned enterprises with the government's help was very secure, unlike in the past when they waited alone on the road for customers with no certainty. They not only quickly organized themselves automatically but also gradually eliminated the various bad influences of the guild and, through democratic discussions by the workers, replaced bad foremen like Miao Shilin, who was initially elected as the team leader due to lack of caution. The city's Support the Front Committee also stipulated two principles regarding wage issues: first, the wage standard would not be changed due to market fluctuations in transportation supply and demand; second, the then-market price of millet would be the standard for actual wages, to appropriately guarantee the workers' actual wage income. This further increased the workers' enthusiasm. During transportation, some workers initially treated the People's Liberation Army's military grain with the same attitude as they had treated the Kuomintang's military grain, feeling that it didn't matter if some was lost or stolen. After education, everyone reflected on their past mistakes, studied methods to protect military grain, and elected seven grain protection committee members to supervise and inspect. According to statistics from the Military Grain Processing Committee, grain loss during flatbed cart transportation in the city has decreased from six taels per hundred catties in December of last year to three taels.

　　克服了行会坏影响
    订出爱护军粮办法
  　王春田运输队发展壮大
    【新华社济南二十四日电】包括四百余人、二百六十二辆地排车的济南市王春田运输大队，于去年十一、十二两个月中转运了二万六千余吨军粮，完成了在淮海战役中该市市区人力运转军粮任务的十分之七左右。该运输大队是由当初三个人拉军粮发展起来，中间曾经反对行会的破坏的斗争，现在并已在该队基础上组成了十一区运输工人合作社。济市在国民党统治时代，运输工人中封建性的行会很普遍，行会的头子与国民党、厂方勾结剥削压迫工人，解放后行会头子反对工人自己组织起来。淮海战役时王春田和现在的大队副王瑞年，参加转运公粮，一天来回八趟，可挣两万四千元，这样推动了大家纷纷组织起来。他们感到在政府帮助下替公营企业干活很有保障，不象过去每天在路上无把握的独自等待主顾。他们不但很快的自动组织起来，并且逐步的除去了行会的各种坏影响，并经由工人民主讨论撤换了开始时因不郑重而被选为队长的坏工头苗士林等人物。该市支前委员会又规定了两个工资问题的原则：一、不因市场上运输的供求变化而改变工资标准。二、以当时小米的市价为实际工资的标准，以适当的保障工人实际工资所得，这样就更加提高工人们的积极性。在运输中，起初有些工人还以对待国民党的军粮的态度来对待解放军的军粮，觉得漏掉些、偷窃些不算什么。经教育后，大家检讨了过去错误行为，研究出爱护军粮办法，并评出七个护粮委员督促检查。据军粮加工委员会统计，全市地排车转运中粮食损耗，已由去年十二月的每百斤损耗六两减少为三两。
