　　A Critique of the Kuomintang's Various Answers Regarding the Issue of War Responsibility

　　"Since the end of the War of Resistance Against Japan, the government has strived to peacefully resolve the CCP issue with a national reconstruction policy of peace. After a year and a half, all agreements were broken by the CCP, so the CCP should bear the responsibility for destroying peace. Today, the CCP has instead put forward a so-called list of war criminals, including all responsible government officials, and even demanded that the government arrest them first, which is obviously barbaric and unreasonable. If the CCP does not change this style, it will be difficult to find a path for peaceful negotiations."

　　The above is the complete argument of the Kuomintang Central Propaganda Department's special propaganda instructions issued on February 13, 1949, regarding the issue of war responsibility. This argument is not from anyone else, but from the number one war criminal, Chiang Kai-shek. In his New Year's Day statement, Chiang Kai-shek said: "As a follower of the Three Principles of the People, Chung Cheng inherits the teachings of the Founding Father and is unwilling to follow the war against Japan with a military campaign to suppress bandits, to increase the suffering of the people. Therefore, as soon as the War of Resistance ended, our government immediately raised the policy of peaceful national reconstruction, and further used political consultation and military mediation to solve the Communist Party issue. Unexpectedly, after a year and a half, the Communist Party obstructed all agreements and plans, preventing them from being implemented according to the expected steps. And finally launched its overall rebellion, endangering the survival of the country. Our government was forced to endure the pain and mobilize to engage in suppression of the rebellion."

　　Seven days before Chiang Kai-shek issued this statement, on December 25, 1948, a certain authoritative person of the CCP put forward a list of forty-three war criminals, with Chiang Kai-shek prominently listed as number one. The war criminals want to negotiate and also want to escape responsibility, so the only way is to push the responsibility onto the Communist Party. But this is irreconcilable. Since the Communist Party should bear the responsibility for starting the war, then the Communist Party should be punished. Since they are "bandits," they should be "suppressed." Since they "launched their overall rebellion," they should be suppressed. "Suppressing bandits" and "suppressing the rebellion" is 100% correct, so why shouldn't they be suppressed? Why, from January 1, 1949, onwards, did all Kuomintang documents uniformly change "Communist bandits" to "Communist Party"?

　　Sun Ke felt that something was not quite right. He delivered a radio address on the same night that Chiang Kai-shek issued his New Year's Day statement, putting forward a different argument regarding the issue of war responsibility. Sun Ke said: "Recalling three years ago, in the early days of the victory of the War of Resistance, because the people needed to recuperate and because the country needed active construction, and because various parties had a common understanding of the needs of the country and the people, we once gathered representatives from all sides and social elites to hold a Political Consultative Conference. After three weeks of effort, and thanks to President Truman's special envoy, Mr. Marshall, for his good intentions in mediating, we also agreed on a program for peaceful national reconstruction and specific plans to resolve various disputes. If we could have implemented these plans in a timely manner, just imagine how prosperous China would be today, and how happy the Chinese people would be today! Unfortunately, at that time, various parties failed to completely abandon their petty self-interests, and the people of the whole country failed to make their best efforts to promote the success of this peace movement, which led to the recurrence of war and the suffering of the people."

　　Sun Ke is a bit more "fair" than Chiang Kai-shek. You see, he did not, like Chiang Kai-shek, push the responsibility for the war entirely onto the Communist Party, but instead adopted the method of "equal land rights," dividing the responsibility equally among "all parties"; this includes the Kuomintang, the Communist Party, the Democratic League, and social elites. Not only that, but also "the people of the whole country," all 475 million compatriots cannot escape responsibility. Chiang Kai-shek is exclusively targeting the Communist Party, while Sun Ke is giving each party, faction, non-party member, and compatriot a blow, and even Chiang Kai-shek, and perhaps Sun Ke himself, must endure a blow. You see, two Kuomintang members, Sun Ke and Chiang Kai-shek, are fighting here.

　　A third Kuomintang member ran up and said, no, in my opinion, the responsibility should be entirely borne by the Kuomintang. This person's name is Li Zongren. On January 22, 1949, Li Zongren, in his capacity as "Acting President," issued a statement. Regarding the issue of war responsibility, he said: "After the eight-year War of Resistance, followed by three years of civil war, not only was the glimmer of hope for national revival after the victory of the War of Resistance completely destroyed, but the war also spread throughout the north and south of the Yellow River, with fields and houses destroyed and abandoned, and countless innocent people killed or wounded, and wives and children separated, crying from hunger and cold everywhere. This horrific catastrophe is unprecedented in the history of our country's civil wars."

　　Li Zongren is issuing a notice without a head here. He did not say that the Kuomintang should be responsible, nor did he say that the Communist Party or other parties should be responsible, but he stated a fact: this "horrific catastrophe" did not occur elsewhere, but in the "north and south of the Yellow River." Looking south of the Yellow River to the Yangtze River, and north of the Yellow River to the Songhua River, who created this "horrific catastrophe" here? Could it be that the people and the people's army here created it by fighting among themselves? Li Zongren served as the Director of the Peiping Pacification Headquarters, and the Gui Clique's army fought alongside the Chiang Clique's army to the Yimeng Mountains, so he has accurate information and knows the location and situation of this "catastrophe." If Li Zongren is not good at anything else, then it is good that he told this truth. Moreover, the name he gave to this war is not "suppression of rebellion" or "suppression of bandits," but "civil war," which can be considered quite unique from the Kuomintang's perspective.

　　According to Li Zongren's own logic, in the same statement he said: "The government is willing to start negotiations immediately on the eight conditions proposed by the CCP." Li Zongren knows that the first of the eight conditions is to punish war criminals, and his own name is also on the list. The punishment of war criminals is the logical conclusion of the "catastrophe." Because of this, Kuomintang diehards are still complaining in a roundabout way about Li Zongren, the so-called "Mao Zedong's January 14th statement proposing eight points are conditions for national subjugation, and the government should not have accepted them."

　　The reason why the diehards' complaints can only be roundabout and dare not be blatant is because of a reason. When Chiang Kai-shek had not yet "retired," the diehards originally wanted to refute the eight points, but later Chiang Kai-shek thought it was inappropriate and decided not to refute them, probably believing that refuting them would cut off all avenues. This was on January 19th. When Zhang Junmai returned to Shanghai from Nanjing on the morning of January 19th and gave a speech saying, "Regarding the eight conditions proposed by the CCP, the government may soon issue another document to respond," the Central News Agency immediately issued a notice in the evening saying, "The draft of Zhang Junmai's speech broadcasted in Shanghai is requested to add a note at the end of the text as follows: The Central News Agency reporter learned from relevant sources that the government has no intention of issuing another document as mentioned in Zhang's speech." On January 21st, Chiang Kai-shek issued a "retirement" statement, without refuting or criticizing the eight points; and he also cancelled his own five points, changing them to "to achieve the integrity of territorial sovereignty, to prevent the destruction of history, culture, and social order, and to ensure the people's lives and freedoms, and to achieve peace under these principles." He dared not mention the constitution, legal system, or army. Therefore, Li Zongren dared to admit on January 22nd that he would use the CCP's eight points as the basis for negotiations, and the Kuomintang diehards did not dare to openly oppose it, but could only say in a roundabout way, "The government should not have accepted them."

　　Is Sun Ke's "equal land rights" policy still unchanged? No, it is not. After Sun Ke "moved the government to Guangzhou" on February 5, 1949, he delivered a speech on February 7. Regarding the issue of war responsibility, he said: "In the past six months, due to the spread of war and serious changes in the overall situation, the people have suffered greatly. All of these are the consequences of past mistakes, failures, and unreasonable phenomena, leading to the serious situation today. We deeply know that China needs the Three Principles of the People, and if the Three Principles of the People cannot be realized one day, then China's problems will never be solved. Recalling that the Premier of our party personally handed over the Three Principles of the People to our party twenty years ago, hoping that it could be gradually implemented. If it had been implemented, it would never have evolved into the unmanageable situation of today." People, please see, the Prime Minister of the Kuomintang government here, is not dividing the responsibility equally among all parties and compatriots, but is bearing it by the Kuomintang itself. Sun Ke is placing all the blame on the Kuomintang's behind, which makes people feel very relieved. As for the Communist Party? Our Prime Minister said: "When we observe that the CCP can only seduce and anesthetize the people, it is nothing more than using a part of the Principle of the People's Livelihood, namely the equal land rights, as a slogan. We are deeply ashamed and strengthen our vigilance, and re-examine the mistakes of the past." Thank you, dear Prime Minister, although the Communist Party still has the crime of "seducing and anesthetizing the people," it does not have any other heinous crimes, and it is exempted from punishment, and its head and behind are preserved and returned.

　　The loveliness of Prime Minister Sun is not limited to this. In the same speech, he also said: "Today, the spread of the Communist Party's power is also due to the fact that the doctrine we believe in has not been implemented. The biggest mistake of our party in the past is that some people in the party excessively believed in military force, and engaged in power struggles internally, leaving the enemy an opportunity to divide and scheme. After the eight-year War of Resistance, it was a once-in-a-thousand-year opportunity to achieve peaceful unification, and the government also had a plan to resolve domestic disputes through political means, but unfortunately it was not implemented. After years of war, the people were in urgent need of rest and recuperation, and the recurrence of war made the people miserable, and the suffering was so deep that it also affected the morale of the army, leading to military setbacks step by step. President Chiang, in accordance with public opinion, realized that military methods could not solve the problem, and issued a statement on New Year's Day, calling for peace." Well, this war criminal, Sun Ke, was not arrested or beaten, but automatically confessed, and accurately and without error. Who believed in military force, started the war, and only sought peace after military methods failed to solve the problem? It is the Kuomintang, it is Chiang Kai-shek. Prime Minister Sun used words and sentences very correctly, saying that it was "some people" in their party who excessively believed in military force. This is consistent with the CCP's only demanding the punishment of some Kuomintang members, calling them war criminals, and not demanding the punishment of more or all Kuomintang members.

　　We and Sun Ke have no dispute on this number. The difference is in the conclusion. We believe that these "some people" in the Kuomintang who "believed in military force" and caused "the recurrence of war and the misery of the people" must be punished as war criminals. Sun Ke disagrees with doing so. He said: "Now, the Communist Party is delaying the appointment of representatives and procrastinating, showing that the Communist Party is also believing in military force, thinking that it is now fully fledged and can conquer the whole country by force, so it refuses to stop the war first, and its intentions are very obvious. What I must solemnly propose here is that in order to achieve lasting peace, both sides must negotiate on an equal footing, and the conditions should be fair and reasonable and acceptable to the people of the whole country." From this point of view, our Prime Minister is not so lovable anymore. He seems to think that the condition of punishing war criminals is not fair and reasonable. These words of his are the same as the attitude expressed by the Kuomintang Propaganda Department's special propaganda instructions on February 12 regarding the issue of war criminals, which is roundabout and dare not openly oppose, which is very different from Li Zongren's daring to admit that punishing war criminals is one of the basic conditions for negotiations.

　　But Prime Minister Sun still has lovable aspects, which is that he said that the Communist Party is also "believing in military force," which is manifested in the two points of "delaying the appointment of representatives" and "refusing to stop the war first," rather than starting the horrific war in 1946 like the Kuomintang. The reason for "delaying the appointment of representatives" is that determining the list of war criminals is a major event, and it must be "acceptable to the people of the whole country." If there are too few or too many, it is not in line with reality, and "the people of the whole country" (excluding war criminals and their accomplices) cannot accept it, so it is necessary to consult with various democratic parties and people's organizations, and thus "dragged on" for a period of time, and failed to quickly appoint representatives, causing considerable unhappiness to people like Sun Ke. But this cannot be concluded as "also believing in military force." It will probably not be long before the list of war criminals is announced, the representatives can be appointed, and the negotiations can begin, and Prime Minister Sun will not be able to say that we "believe in military force."

　　As for "refusing to stop the war first," this is the correct attitude taken in accordance with President Chiang's New Year's Day statement. President Chiang's New Year's Day statement said: "As long as the Communist Party has a sincere desire for peace and can make a definite expression, the government will be open and honest, and is willing to discuss specific methods for stopping the war and restoring peace." Sun Ke's Executive Yuan made a resolution on January 19 that violated Chiang Kai-shek's above-mentioned statement, saying something like "immediately stop the war unconditionally first, and appoint representatives to conduct peace talks." The CCP spokesperson gave a stern criticism of this unreasonable resolution on January 21. Unexpectedly, the Prime Minister turned a deaf ear and said nonsense again on February 7 that the CCP "refused to stop the war first," which means that the CCP "is also believing in military force." Even a war criminal like Chiang Kai-shek knows that stopping the war and restoring peace is impossible without "negotiation," and Sun Ke is far inferior to Chiang Kai-shek in this regard.

　　People know that the reason why Sun Ke became a war criminal is that he has always supported Chiang Kai-shek in starting the war and insisted on the war. As late as June 22, 1947, he also said: "In the military aspect, as long as we fight to the end, it can be solved in the end." "There is no peace talk to speak of at present. The government must defeat the Communist Party, otherwise the Communist Party will overthrow the Kuomintang government." He is one of the "some people" in the Kuomintang who believe in military force. Now he is standing aside and making sarcastic remarks, as if he has never believed in military force, and he is not responsible for the failure to implement the Three Principles of the People. This is disloyal, and whether it is in the eyes of national law or in the Kuomintang's party law, Sun Ke cannot escape punishment.

### 评国民党对于战争责任问题的几种答案

　　评国民党对于战争责任问题的几种答案
    “政府自抗战结束以后，即以和平建国方针力谋中共问题之和平解决。经过一年半之时间，一切协议皆为中共所破坏，故中共应负破坏和平之责任。今日中共反而提出所谓战犯名单，将政府负责人士尽皆列入，更要求政府先行逮捕，其横蛮无理，显而易见。中共如不改变此种作风，则和平商谈之途径，势难寻觅。”
    以上是一九四九年二月十三日国民党中央宣传部所发特别宣传指示关于战争责任问题的全部论点。这个论点，不是别人的，是第一名战争罪犯蒋介石的。蒋介石在其元旦声明里说：“中正为三民主义的信徒，秉承国父的遗教，本不愿在对日作战之后再继之以剿匪的军事，来加重人民的痛苦。所以，抗战甫经结束，我们政府立即揭举和平建国的方针，更进而以政治协商、军事调处的方法解决共党问题。不意经过了一年有半的时间，共党对于一切协议和方案都横加梗阻，使其不能依预期的步骤见诸实施。而最后更发动其全面的叛乱，危害国家的生存。我政府迫不得已、乃忍痛动员，从事戡乱。”
    在蒋介石发表这个声明的前七天，即一九四八年十二月二十五日，即有中共某权威人士提出了四十三个战犯名单，赫然列在第一名的，就是这个蒋介石。战犯们又要求和，又要逃避责任，只有将责任推在共产党身上一个法子。可是这是不调和的。共产党既然应负发动战争的责任，那末，就应当惩办共产党。既然是“匪”就应当“剿匪”。既然“发动其全面的叛乱”，就应当“戡乱”。“剿匪”，“戡乱”，是百分之百的对，为什么可以不剿不戡了呢？为什么从一九四九年一月一日以后，一切国民党的文件一律将“共匪”改成了“共党”呢？
    孙科觉得有些不妥，他在蒋介石发表元旦声明同一天的晚上发表广播演说，关于战争责任问题提出了一个不同的论点。孙科说：“回忆三年前，当抗战胜利的初期，由于人民需要休养生息，由于国家需要积极建设，由于各党派对国家和人民的需要尚有共同的认识，我们曾经集合各方代表和社会贤达于一堂，举行过政治协商会议。经过三星期的努力，更多谢杜鲁门总统的特使马歇尔先生的善意调协，我们也曾经商定了一个和平建国纲领和解决各种争端的具体方案。假如当时我们能将各种方案及时实行，试问今日的中国应该是如何的繁荣，今天的中国人民应该是如何的幸福呵！可惜当时各方既未能完全放弃小我的利害，全国人民亦未能用最大的努力去促进这个和平运动的成功，遂致战祸复发，生灵涂炭。”
    孙科比较蒋介石“公道”一点，你看，他不是如同蒋介石那样，将战争责任一塌括子推在共产党身上，而是采取了“平均地权”的办法，将责任平分给“各方”；这里也有国民党，也有共产党，也有民主同盟，也有社会贤达。不甯唯是，而且“全国人民”，四万万七千五百万同胞一个也逃不了责任。蒋介石是专打共产党的板子，孙科是给各党各派无党无派全国同胞每人一板子，连蒋介石，也许还有孙科也得捱上一板子。你看，两个国民党人，孙科和蒋介石，在这里打架。
    第三个国民党人跑上来说，不然，照我的意见，责任应全归国民党。这个人的名字叫做李宗仁。一九四九年一月二十二日李宗仁以“代总统”的身份发表了一个声明。关于战争责任问题，他说：“在八年抗战之后，继之以三年之内战，不仅将抗战胜利后国家可能复兴之一线生机毁灭无遗，而战祸遍及黄河南北，田园卢舍悉遭摧毁荒废和无辜人民之死伤成千累万，妻离子散啼饥号寒者到处皆是。此一惨绝人寰之浩劫，实为我国内战史上空前所未有。”
    李宗仁在这里出的是无头告示，他也没有说国民党应负责任，也没有说共产党或者别的方面应负责任，但是他说出了一个事实，这个“惨绝人寰的浩劫”，不是出在别的地方，而是出在“黄河南北”。查黄河以南直至长江，黄河以北直至松花江，谁在这里造成这“惨绝人寰的浩劫”呢？难道是这里的人民及人民的军队自己打自己造成的么？李宗仁是做过北平行营主任的，桂系的军队是和蒋系军队一道打到过沂蒙山区的，所以他有确实的情报，知道这里“浩劫”的地点和情况。如果说，李宗仁别的什么都不好，那么他说出了这句老实话总算是好的。而且他对这场战争起的名称，不叫“戡战”，或“剿匪”，而叫“内战”，这在国民党方面来说也算得颇为别致。
    根据李宗仁自己的逻辑，在同一个声明里他说：“中共方面所提八条条件，政府愿即开始商谈。”李宗仁知道八条的第一条就是惩办战犯，而且也有他自己的大名在内。战犯之应当惩办，这是“浩劫”的逻辑结论。为了这一点，至今国民党死硬派还在吞吞吐吐地埋怨李宗仁，即所谓“毛泽东一月十四日声明所提八点为亡国条件，政府原不应接受。”
    死硬派的埋怨之所以只能是吞吞吐吐，而不敢明目张胆，是有原因的。当蒋介石还没有“引退”时，死硬派原来想批驳八条，后来蒋介石一想不妥，决定不驳，大概是认为驳了就绝了路了，这是一月十九日的事情。当着一月十九日早上张君劢从南京回到上海发表谈话说“关于中共所提八项条件，政府不久即可能发布另一文告，提出答复”的时候，中央社即于晚间发出通报说：“顷播沪电张君劢谈话一稿，请于电文末加注按语如下：张氏谈话中所说政府不久即发布另一文告一点，中央社记者顷自有关方面探悉，政府并无发布另一文告之拟议。”一月二十一日蒋介石发表“引退”声明，并无复字批评八条；并且把他自己的五条也取消了，改变为“使领土主权克臻完整，历史文化与社会秩序不受摧残，人民生活与自由权利确有保障，在此原则下以致和平之功”。宪法、法统、军队等项都不敢再提了。因此，李宗仁在一月二十二日敢于承认以中共的八条为谈判基础，国民党死硬派也不敢明目张胆地出面反对，只能吞吞吐吐地说一声“政府原不应接受。”
    孙科的“平均地”权政策是否坚持不变呢？也不。一九四九年二月五日孙科“迁政府于广州”以后，二月七日发表演说，关于战争责任问题，他说：“半年以来，因战祸蔓延，大局发生严重变化，人民痛苦万状。凡此种种，均系过去所犯错误、失败及不合理现象种下前因，以致有今日局势严重之后果。吾人深知中国需要三民主义，三民主义一日不能实现，则中国之问题始终不能解决。追忆本党总理二十年以前以三民主义亲自遗交本党，冀其逐步得以实行。苟获实行，绝不致演至今日不可收拾之局面。”人们请看，国民党政府行政院长在这里，不是平分责任给一切党派和全国同胞，而是由国民党自己担负起来了。孙科将一切板子都打在国民党的屁股上，使人们觉得甚为痛快。至于共产党呢？我们的行政院长说：“吾人试观中共能以诱惑及麻醉人民，亦无非仅以实行三民主义之民生主义一部分，即平均地权一节为号召。吾人实深感惭愧，而加强警惕，重新检讨过去之错误。”谢谢亲爱的院长，共产党虽然尚有“诱惑及麻醉人民”的罪名，总算没有别的滔天大罪，致邀免打，获保首领及屁股而归。
    孙院长的可爱，还不止此。他在同一演说里又说：“今日共党势力之蔓延，亦即系吾人信仰之主义未能实行之故。本党在过去最大之错误，即系党内若干人士过分迷信武力，对内则争权倾轧，坐遗敌人分化谋间之机会。及至八年抗战之后，本为实现和平统一千载难逢之时机，政府方面亦原有以政治方式解决国内纠纷之计划，不幸未能贯彻实施。人民于连年战乱之后，已亟待休养生息，刀兵再起，民不聊生，痛苦殊深，亦影响土气之消沉，以致军事步步失利。蒋总统俯顺民情，鉴于军事方法之未能解决问题，乃于元旦发表文告，号召和平。”好了，孙科这一名战争罪犯，没有被捕，也没有被打，即自动招供，而且忠实无误。谁是迷信武力，发动战争，及至军事方法未能解决问题方始求和的呢？就是国民党，就是蒋介石。孙院长用字造句也很正确，他说过分迷信武力的是他们党内的“若干人士”。这一点，对于中共仅仅要求惩办若干国民党人，把他们称之为战争罪犯，而不要求惩办更多的更不是全体的国民党人，是互相一致的。
    我们和孙科之间，在这个数目字上并无争论。不同的是在结论上。我们认为，对于这些“迷信武力”，使得“刀兵再起，民不聊生”的国民党“若干人士”，必须当作战犯加以惩办。孙科则不同意这样做。他说：“现共方之迟迟不指派代表，一味拖延，显示共方亦正迷信武力，自以为目前业已羽毛丰满，可以凭借武力征服全国，故拒绝先行停战、其用心亦极显然。余兹须郑重提出者，即为求获得永久之和平，双方必须以平等资格进行商谈，条件则应公平合理，为全国人所能接受者。”这样看来，我们的院长又有些不可爱了。他似乎认为惩办战争罪犯一项条件不算公平合理。他的这些话和二月十二日国民党宣传部的特别宣传指示对于战犯问题所表示的态度是一样吞吞吐吐，不敢明目张胆提出反对，较之李宗仁敢于承认以惩办战犯为谈判基础条件之一，大不相同。
    但是孙院长仍旧有可爱的地方，这即是他说共产党亦正“迷信武力”，是表现在“迟迟不指派代表”和“拒绝先行停战”这两点上，而不是如同国民党那样在一九四六年就迷信武力发动惨绝人寰的战争。夫“迟迟不指派代表”者，是因为确定战犯名单是一件大事，要是“为全国人所能接受者”，少了，多了，都不合实际，“全国人”（但不包括战犯及其帮凶）不能接受，故须和各民主党派人民团体互相商量，以此“拖延”了一段时间，并且未能迅速指派代表，引起了孙科之流颇为不快。但是这也不能一口断定即为“亦正迷信武力”。大约不要很久，战犯名单就可公布，代表就可指派，谈判就可开始，孙院长就不能说我们“迷信武力”了。
    至于“拒绝先行停战”，这是服从蒋总统元旦文告而采取的正确态度。蒋总统元旦文告说：“只要共党一有和平的诚意，能作确切的表示，政府必开诚相见，愿与商讨停止战争、恢复和平的具体方法。”孙科的行政院于一月十九日做出一个违反蒋介石上述文告的决议，说什么“立即先行无条件停战，并各指派代表进行和平商谈”。中共发言人曾于一月二十一日给了这个不通的决议以严正的批评。不料该院长充耳不闻，又于二月七日乱说什么中共“拒绝先行停战”，就是表示中共“亦正迷信武力”。连蒋介石那样的战争罪犯，也知道停止战争恢复和平，没有“商谈”是不可能的，孙科在这点上比蒋介石差远了。
    人们知道孙科之所以成为战犯，是因为他一向赞助蒋介石发动战争，并坚持战争。直到一九四七年六月二十二日他还说：“在军事方面，只要打到底，终归可以解决。”“目前已无和谈可言，政府必须打垮共党，否则即是共党推翻国民政府。”他就是国民党内迷信武力的“若干人士”之一。现在他站在一旁说风凉话，好象他并没有迷信过武力，三民主义没有实行他也不负责任。这是不忠实的，无论正国法，或者在国民党内正党法，孙科都逃不了捱板子。
