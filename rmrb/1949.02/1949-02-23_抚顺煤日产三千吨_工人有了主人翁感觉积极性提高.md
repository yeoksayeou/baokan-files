Xinhua News Agency, Shenyang, February 21st: The Fushun Coal Mine Bureau's restoration work has achieved significant results in the past three months in mining, mechanical and electrical engineering, and transportation. In these past three months, the total coal production of all mines has exceeded the level during the Kuomintang's rule. In October of last year, when the Kuomintang occupied the area, coal production was 47,800 tons. After liberation in November, production increased to 60,000 tons, and in December it increased to 88,700 tons, with an average daily output of 3,068 tons. In January of this year, due to the New Year holiday, there were 26 working days, and 86,900 tons of coal were produced, with an average daily output increasing to 3,343 tons.

Various production equipment is also being actively improved. The open-pit mine, which produces the most coal, has undergone extensive stripping work (i.e., removing the topsoil and rocks covering the coal seam to expose the coal layer). The total stripping volume in January reached 142,000 cubic meters. Of the rock or coal excavating machines (the largest weighing 200 tons, all electrically operated, capable of excavating 1,700 tons per day), only four were functional under Kuomintang management. Now, all sixteen have been repaired. The number of rock-loading vehicles has increased from over 200 before liberation to over 300 currently. The number of electric trams has also increased from 36 to 64. The 180-kilometer-long railway, usable by both electric trams and trains, is undergoing continuous sleeper replacement and signal system improvement.

In terms of mining shafts, the Shengli, Laohutai, and Longfeng mines opened two sealed areas in January (during the Kuomintang rule, fires often occurred in the pits, so the mining areas were sealed off), recovering an estimated one million tons or more of recoverable coal. Other mechanical, electrical, chemical, and light bulb factories supporting coal mine production have also completed their production plans, facilitating the resumption of coal mine production.

The above achievements are due to a series of organizational and educational work carried out by the mine for its employees. After the mine's liberation, every employee received relief funds, food, and fuel, which increased their understanding of the People's Government. However, at this time, the employees' thinking was mainly focused on meeting their living needs. Therefore, cadres from the CCP Mine Committee, administration, and trade union were dispatched to the eighteen mines and factories (over 30,000 employees) to meet directly with the workers and repeatedly explain the Communist Party's policies and the attitudes that employees should have. The Mine Employees' General Union also ran a large number of training classes. Each mine also held short-term training classes for 30 to 50 or even hundreds of people, focusing on class education, explaining the benefits of trade unions, labor insurance regulations, employee solidarity, etc., and separately convening technical personnel and veteran workers to listen to their opinions on improving production and establishing technical research associations. By the end of January, over 6,000 employees throughout the mine had received training. Recently, two full-mine worker representative forums were held. Each representative, based on the standpoint of cherishing the mine, put forward many constructive opinions.

As a result of this series of work, employees initially developed a sense of ownership, and their enthusiasm greatly increased. Everyone no longer simply focused on livelihood issues, but instead competed to see who could do the best job. For example, thirteen mechanical and electrical workers in the Shengli Mine voluntarily repaired cylinders during the Spring Festival holiday. Many workers were consciously protecting the mine, forming a mass movement to donate equipment. After discussions among employees, the labor discipline of the mine was also established.

　　抚顺煤日产三千吨
  　工人有了主人翁感觉积极性提高
    【新华社沈阳二十一日电】抚顺煤矿矿务局的恢复工作，三个多月来在矿山、机电、运输各方面均获得极重要成绩。过去三个多月中，各矿煤产总量，已超过国民党统治时的水平。去年十月份国民党占领时产煤四万七千八百吨，十一月份光复后，产量增至六万吨，十二月份增至八万八千七百吨，平均日产三千零六十八吨；今年一月份因放年假，工作日为二十六天，共产煤八万六千九百吨，平均日产量增至三千三百四十三吨。各种生产设备亦在积极改进。产煤最多的露天矿曾进行了大量的剥离工作（即是将覆于煤层上的表土与岩石刨除，使之露出煤层）。一月份剥离的总数达十四万二千立方公尺。掘岩石或煤的机器镐（最大的二百吨重，全由电气操纵，每天可掘一千七百吨），国民党经营时只有四台能用，现已将十六台全部修复。装载岩石的车辆已由收复前的二百余辆增至现在的三百余辆。电车亦由三十六台增到六十四台。长达一百八十公里的电车火车两用铁路，正在继续拆换枕木，健全信号。矿井方面，胜利、老虎台、龙凤三矿在一月份中曾打开了两处密闭（国民党统治时，坑内常发生火灾，因此将采煤场所密闭起来），挽回了其中可采的煤约在百万吨以上。其他配合煤矿生产的机电、化学、灯泡等工厂，也都完成了生产计划，便利了煤矿的复工生产。上述成绩的获得，是由于该矿对职工们进行了一系列的组织教育工作。该矿解放后，每个职工都得到了救济金、粮食和燃料，对人民政府认识提高。但是这时职工的思想主要还是要求生活上的满足。因之，中共矿山党委、行政和工会的干部都分散到十八个矿厂（三万多职工）中去，直接与工人见面，反复解释共产党的政策及职工应有的态度。矿山职工总会更大量开办训练班，各矿也都举行了三五十人到几百人的短期训练班，着重进行阶级教育，解释工会的好处及劳动保险条例、职工团结等，并分别召集技术人员及老工人座谈，听取他们关于改进生产的意见，成立技术研究会。全矿受过训的职工，截至一月底已达六千余人。最近又举行了两次全矿规模的工人代表座谈会，每个代表都从爱护矿山的立场出发，提出了很多建设性的意见。由于这一系列的工作，使职工们初步有了主人翁的感觉，积极性大为提高，大家不再是仅仅计较生活问题，而是比赛看谁干的好。如胜利矿十三位机电工友，自动在春节假期修理汽缸，许多工友都能自觉的爱护矿山，形成了群众性的献交器材运动，经过职工讨论，矿厂的劳动纪律也建立起来了。
