　　Condolences
  　“Not much, just a token of our hearts”
    [Shijiazhuang News] The Guangming Public Factory in Shijiazhuang has launched a wave of enthusiasm for making condolence bags and writing condolence letters to show appreciation for the soldiers. The entrance to the employee cooperative was crowded with people, and the three comrades working there were busy from morning till night. In the condolence bag of Xu Lianhe, an old worker in the power room, there was a bar of soap and a towel wrapped in a newspaper. He specifically pointed out the newspaper to others: "This is the newspaper that reported the liberation of Tianjin!" Yu Qinghe, a worker in the basement, earns over two hundred pounds of rice a month and supports a family of three, living a tight life. But this time he bought two towels, two bars of scented soap, two pairs of socks, one bar of soap, and one pencil, totaling more than 1,300 yuan (new currency). In his letter, he wrote: "In this cold weather, you endure hunger and cold, fighting bravely at the front, liberating the entire Northeast, and liberating Tianjin. The reactionaries, seeing that they are failing, feign sincerity and say they want to talk about peace. We have suffered enough from them before, and we can't be deceived by them again this time. No matter how difficult it is for us, we must eliminate the reactionaries completely and carry the revolution through to the end!" Hou Ronggui, from the factory police team, packed a towel, soap, mask, tobacco pouch, and tobacco bag in his condolence bag, and specially inserted a bright, thin steel wire into the tobacco pipe for cleaning it.
    One worker comrade was asked, "Why haven't you brought your condolence bag yet?" He said, "My wife is embroidering the bag; she embroidered all day yesterday and still hasn't finished."
    "Not much, just a token of our hearts!" Many worker comrades said this.

As of the 25th of last month, more than 130 condolence bags of various colors of fine cloth, foreign cloth, and coarse cloth had been collected in the district and county. Each bag was filled with comfort items of various kinds with special commemorative value: towels, tooth powder, toothbrushes, soap, diaries, pencils, socks of various colors... and each bag included a condolence letter written by the maker, expressing their hearts.
    On each pocket, some embroidered and some wrote various colorful inscriptions, such as "Performing meritorious service for the people," "Heroes of the people," "Steel hard bones," etc. Now these comfort items are being prepared for delivery to the front, and some are still being rushed to completion.

  　A letter from a district cadre
    To all commanders and fighters at the front:
    Now that the old Lunar New Year is here, I, on behalf of the staff of the Eighth District of Ping Shan, extend to you our sincere and high respect and condolences, and celebrate your recent great victory in liberating the ancient cultural city of China - Beiping and the important industrial and commercial city of North China - Tianjin.
    Invincible heroes! Please put your minds at ease and fight for victory. We, the rear staff, guarantee that the housework of every comrade will be properly taken care of; we must also lead the farmers in the rear to step up production and produce more grain to support the front even more vigorously. Everyone should aim at the dog's head of the Chiang bandit. Smash him into a pile of muddy flesh, and strive for the early arrival of our victory, and establish an independent, free, democratic, and unified new country. Finally, I wish you good health and a happy New Year!
  　　　　　　　Zhou Ziliang, Eighth District of Ping Shan, January 20th

　　慰问
  　“东西不多，表表咱的心”
    【石家庄讯】石家庄公营光明工厂掀起了做慰问袋、写慰问信的劳军热潮。职工合作社门口挤满了人，社里三个工作同志从早到晚忙不过来。动力房老工人徐连和的慰问袋里，一条肥皂，一条毛巾，用一张报纸包着。他特别把报纸指给别人看：“这是登着解放天津的报纸啊！”于庆合，地下室的工人，一月二百多斤米，养活三口人，生活不宽裕。可是这次买了两条毛巾、两块香皂、两双袜子、一条肥皂、一枝铅笔，共一千三百余元（新币）。他在信上说：“大冷天，你们忍饥受冻，在前方英勇作战，解放了全东北，又解放了平津，反动派眼看着自己不行了，就假心假意说要讲和平。咱们以前吃够了他们的亏，这回再不能受他们的骗。不论咱再怎么艰苦，一定要把反动派消灭完，把革命进行到底！”厂警队侯荣贵，在慰问袋里装了毛巾、肥皂、口罩、烟袋、烟荷包，特别在烟袋杆里插着一条明净的细钢丝，通烟袋杆用。
    有位工人同志，别人问他：“你的慰问袋怎么还不拿来？”他说：“我家里（妻子）正绣花里，昨天绣了一天还没绣好。”
    “东西不多，表表咱们的一片心！”很多工人同志们这样说。
