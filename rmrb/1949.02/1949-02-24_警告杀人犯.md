　　Warning to Murderers
Following the massacre on the 12th of this month, where Kuomintang Yunnan Province's puppet chairman Lu Han ordered the slaughter of 21 citizens who were attempting to withdraw funds due to the plummeting value of the puppet gold yuan, on the 17th of this month, under the direction of Kuomintang puppet Jinghu-Hangzhou Garrison Commander Tang Enbo, Kuomintang puppet Songhu Garrison Commander Chen Daqing ordered the massacre of three leaders of a strike against hunger at the Shanghai Traffic Automobile Company, causing a new bloody incident. At the same time, the heinous Kuomintang secret service agencies are secretly intensifying the arrest and slaughter of revolutionary elements in various places. According to reliable information: The Kuomintang secret service agencies in Shanghai have secretly executed or drowned some imprisoned revolutionary elements in the Huangpu River. Hu Zongnan, director of the Kuomintang Xi'an Pacification Headquarters, is now re-arresting "unadjudicated political prisoners" who were once released on bail and preparing to secretly execute them. Moreover, this is not limited to Shanghai and Xi'an. This situation is not even concealed by the Control Yuan of the Kuomintang government. In a resolution on the 15th of this month, the Control Yuan pointed out that the secret service agencies in various places are not only continuing to illegally arrest people on political grounds, but their activities are also intensifying. This is a new blood debt of the Kuomintang bandit gang, who are at the end of their rope, for slaughtering the people. The people of the whole country, especially the people of the liberated areas, have expressed righteous indignation at these inhuman crimes of the Kuomintang murderers.
    These bloody facts prove that the Kuomintang bandit gang's hypocritical posture of peace, which they put on because they are on the verge of collapse, cannot conceal their real actions of intensifying the slaughter of peaceful people. The big landlords and big bourgeoisie are unwilling to automatically withdraw from the stage of history, and they are intensifying their desperate resistance to the people's revolution tenfold and a hundredfold as they approach death. These bloody incidents are educating the people of the whole country to recognize this unshakeable truth. We now solemnly warn those Kuomintang political figures who have expressed their willingness to hold peace talks with the Chinese Communist Party: If you cannot immediately and effectively stop even such bloody crimes, then you cannot make people believe any of your words, then you cannot show that you are any different from those Kuomintang die-hards who are utterly ruthless. As for those murderous criminals, they will never escape their full responsibility, and the Chinese People's Liberation Army will pursue these murderers to the ends of the earth to bring them to justice. War criminals must be severely punished, murderers must pay with their lives, and blood debts must be paid with double interest.

### 警告杀人犯

　　警告杀人犯
    继本月十二日国民党云南省伪主席卢汉下令屠杀挤兑伪金圆券市民廿一人的大血案之后，本月十七日，在国民党伪京沪杭警备总司令汤恩伯的主持之下，国民党伪淞沪警备司令陈大庆又下令屠杀了上海交通汽车公司三个领导反饥饿罢工的工人，造成了新的血腥事件。与此同时，万恶的国民党特务机关正在各地秘密地加紧逮捕和屠杀革命分子。据确息：上海的国民党特务机关，已将一部分被监禁的革命分子秘密处死或投入黄浦江中溺死。国民党西安绥靖公署主任胡宗南，现正重新逮捕一度交保释放的“未判决的政治犯”，并准备将他们秘密处死。而且这样做的，还不止上海和西安两个地方。这种情形，甚至国民党政府的监察院也不加以隐瞒。该监察院在本月十五日的一个决议中曾经指出。各地特务机关不仅继续以政治理由非法捕人，而且他们的这种活动正在变本加厉。这是穷途末路的国民党匪帮屠杀人民的新的血债。对于国民党杀人犯们的这些惨无人道的罪行，全国的人民，首先是解放区的人民已表示了正义的愤恨。
    这些血腥的事实证明，国民党匪帮由于他们濒于覆亡而装出来的虚伪的和平姿态，决不能掩盖他们正加紧屠杀和平人民的真实行动。大地主大资产阶级是不愿自动退出历史舞台的，他们正因为日益接近死亡而十倍百倍地加紧对于人民革命的拼命反抗。这些血腥事件正教育全国人民去认识这个不可移易的真理。我们现在郑重警告那些表示愿与中国共产党进行和谈的国民党政治人物：你们如果连这种血腥罪行都不能立即确实地制止，那么你们就不能使人们相信你们的任何言词，那么你们就不能表示你们与那些穷凶极恶的国民党死硬派有什么分别。至于那些杀人的凶手们，他们决不能逃避他们的全部罪责，中国人民解放军必将追寻这些杀人犯至天涯海角，务使归案法办。战争罪犯必须严惩，杀人者必须偿命，血债必须付出加倍的利息。
