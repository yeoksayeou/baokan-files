[Taihang Electric] In the month or so after the liberation of Weihui, Northern Henan, the cotton textile industry has partially recovered with the help of loans from the democratic government. Thirteen of the larger weaving factories have already started operations, with 110 iron-wheeled looms in total, of which more than 30 are running. Another eight factories (with a total of 92 looms) are also repairing workshops, purchasing cotton yarn, and recruiting workers, preparing to start production. Small factories and family handicraft workers are also actively repairing tools in preparation for production. Some citizens have formed mutual aid groups to overcome the difficulty of insufficient funds. Before the war, the city's cotton weaving and knitting (socks, vests) industries were well-developed, with more than 30 large and small cotton weaving factories, possessing more than 130 looms, and 16 small knitting factories, with 39 sock knitting machines. In addition, family cotton weaving was also very common among the broad masses of citizens, all using iron-wheeled looms for production. Most of the products were sold in the city and the areas of Anyang and Shandong. During the Japanese occupation, the cotton textile industry was devastated, and most of the citizens who relied on weaving for a living lost their livelihood. During the rule of the Chiang Kai-shek bandits, the remaining cotton textile industry was completely crushed by heavy taxes and levies. Each machine had to pay two large dou of wheat as taxes for every ten days of operation each month. Even more abhorrent was that the parts of the looms were requisitioned as iron. Only six looms in the city were barely operating intermittently. After liberation, under the slogan of "developing production and promoting economic prosperity," the democratic government actively supported the resumption of operations. The People's Bank first lent over 4 million Jibi yuan to ten cotton textile factories to help them resume operations. The trade company also provided 120 bales of foreign yarn as production capital. Thanks to the government's loans and support, the factories have been actively resuming operations. Su Desheng has 23 looms and has hired 18 skilled workers, starting up nine machines. Huachang Factory has also purchased 800 bales of cotton yarn and is preparing to start production. Some small factories, family industries, and unemployed workers are also actively acquiring machine parts and raising capital. Some have already started operations, while others are preparing to start. Unemployed worker Xue Qingchao's entire family is participating in weaving, and he is researching how to transform ordinary looms into machines that can weave patterned cloth and twill. The original sock factories and eleven towel machines have also resumed operations one after another.

　　卫辉解放后
  　织布厂先后复业
    【太行电】豫北卫辉棉织业，在解放后的一个多月内，经民主政府贷款扶助，已有部分恢复。较大织布厂已有十三家开工，其有铁轮织布机一百一十台，开动的有三十多台。另有八家（共机九十二台），也正在修理工房，购买棉纱，招收工人，准备开工。小型工厂和家庭手工业工人，也在积极的修理工具，准备生产。一部市民已经结伙互助生产，克服了资金不足的困难。该市战前棉织、针织（袜子、背心）等业均很发达，当时有大小棉织厂卅余家，拥有织机一百三十余台，小型针、织工厂十六家，有织袜机三十九架。另外散布在广大市民中间的家庭棉织业也很普遍，均以铁轮织机生产。产品大部销于本市及安阳、山东一带。日寇占领时期，棉织业遭受摧残，大部依靠织布为生的市民，失去了生活依靠。蒋匪统治时期，残余的一些棉织业被苛捐压榨的全部垮台，每部机子每月开工十天，即需上两大斗麦子的捐；更可恶的是将织机零件当铁征去了，全市只有六架织机勉强断续开工。解放后民主政府在“发展生产，繁荣经济”的口号下，积极扶助复业。人民银行首先贷给十家棉织工厂冀钞四百余万元，使他们复业。贸易公司也拿出洋纱一百廿捆作生产资本。各工厂由于得到政府的贷款扶助，均积极复业。苏德胜有廿三台织机，已雇用了技术工人十八个，开动了九台机子。华昌厂也购到棉纱八百捆，准备开工。一些小型工厂和家庭工业和失业工人，也在积极配备机器零件，筹集资本。有的已经开工，有的正准备开工。失业工人薛清朝全家参加了织布，并正在研究将普通织机改造成能织花布和斜纹布的机器。原有织袜工厂和十一架毛巾机，亦均先后复业。
