　　希腊民主军向各大城市发动进攻
  　保皇法西斯匪徒惊慌失措
    【新华社陕北十九日电】自由希腊电台十六日广播：当保皇法西斯军还没有从在脑萨与卡彭尼西地区所遭的打击恢复过来的时候，民主军又对塞勒斯（马其顿中部）、拉利萨（色萨利东北）、特里喀拉（色萨利西北）、卡迪柴（色萨利中部）及佛罗里那（马其顿西部）等城市发动进攻，并使保皇法西斯军惊慌失措。
    民主军第六师所部在本月八日进攻塞勒斯城的战斗中，在打垮敌人的抵抗之后，占领了若干地区与该城中心。民主军的炮兵胜利地轰击了敌人的阵地，并曾击退保皇法西斯机械化部队的反攻。民主军曾占领该城五小时，受到市民的热烈欢迎。
    另部民主军的骑兵，曾于七、八两日进攻色萨利的战略要地拉利萨城的守敌。拉利萨飞机场的守敌也受到攻击，敌人损失重大。
