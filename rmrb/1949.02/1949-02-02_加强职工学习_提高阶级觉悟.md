　　Strengthen Workers' Study
  　Enhance Class Consciousness
    [Taihang Telegram] In order to strengthen the cultural and technical studies of all workers and enhance the class consciousness of workers, the Taihang Federation of Trade Unions, according to the instructions of the North China Federation of Trade Unions, recently issued another notice to all subordinate district, city, and county trade unions to carry out this work. The notice pointed out: The collapse of the Kuomintang reactionary ruling clique is imminent, and the entire North China will soon be liberated. In order to enable our workers to undertake the task of building a new China, trade unions at all levels must organize and mobilize all workers to launch a large-scale study movement, and improve their culture, technology, and production on the existing basis. The specific organization and learning methods are: (1) Trade unions at all levels should, in accordance with specific circumstances and possible conditions, in factories, mines, and areas where workers are concentrated, use the Spring Festival entertainment opportunities to organize workers, stimulate their enthusiasm for learning, lay the foundation for future learning, and launch a warm learning movement. (2) On this basis, organize workers' spare-time schools, short-term training classes, worker literacy classes, supplementary schools, and other forms to carry out the study movement. (3) In terms of educational content: the resolutions of the Sixth National Labor Congress on the current workers' movement and the decision on several issues in the workers' movement, Comrade Li Lisan's report, and the current situation should be used as teaching materials. The trade union is responsible for making full preparations in advance and then giving specific lectures to the workers. In order to make this work effective, after receiving the notice, trade unions in various places that have not yet been organized should organize immediately, and those that have already been organized should promptly send their steps, plans, progress, experiences, and lessons learned to the Propaganda Department of the General Federation, in order to exchange experiences and promote overall progress.
