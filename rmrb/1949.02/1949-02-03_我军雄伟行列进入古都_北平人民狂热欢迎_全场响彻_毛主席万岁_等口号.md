Xinhua News Agency, Beiping, 31st, 1800 hours urgent cable: From 12:30 this afternoon, the ancient capital of Beiping became a city of the people. The vanguard of the People's Liberation Army has been entering the city continuously through Xizhimen. When the magnificent ranks of the People's Liberation Army passed through the main streets of this historic city, they received a deliriously enthusiastic welcome from the people of Beiping. Among the first troops to enter the city were the "Not a Single Offense" regiment and the heroic defending regiment, both of which had been commended by General Lin Biao's order. The first to arrive at Xizhimen to welcome them were two welcome vehicles of workers from the Beiping Tram Factory, followed by employees from the Railway Bureau, Telecommunications Bureau, and Public Works Bureau, as well as students from Peking University, Normal University, and other schools, who also arrived in trucks. They held triangular flags and shouted welcome slogans, some even reaching out to enthusiastically shake hands with the PLA soldiers passing by. Along the way, the colorful welcoming crowds composed of workers and students gradually increased, and they passed shoulder to shoulder with the People's Liberation Army through Xinjiekou, Xisi Archway, Qiongmen, Wangfujing Street, and Shizi Hutong, while on both sides were tens of thousands of cheering citizens. When propaganda trucks hanging portraits of Chairman Mao passed by, people frantically waved their hats and applauded. Some people even wrote the words "Liberated" on their bodies with chalk, jumping around everywhere. The slogan "Long Live Chairman Mao" rose and fell, endlessly. At 5:00 p.m., more than 4,000 workers from the Telecommunications Bureau and students from Peking University, Dongda University, Fu Jen University, Chaoyang University, and more than ten other schools went to Jiantansi in Zhongnanhai and held a grand celebration with a unit of the People's Liberation Army. At the meeting, each unit sent representatives to pay tribute to the PLA soldiers. Currently, the Drum Tower, Jingshan, Qianmen, and the main traffic arteries of the inner city of Beiping have been garrisoned by the People's Liberation Army. Most of the more than 200,000 Kuomintang troops originally stationed in Beiping have been transferred to designated locations outside the city to await reorganization in accordance with democratic principles. A small number of Fu's troops are still leaving the city in succession. As of the time of dispatch, the People's Liberation Army is continuing to enter the city.

　　我军雄伟行列进入古都
  　北平人民狂热欢迎
    全场响彻“毛主席万岁”等口号
    【新华社北平三十一日十八时急电】自今午十二时半起，古都北平成为人民的城市了。人民解放军的先头部队已经由西直门源源开入城内。当解放军的雄伟行列通过这一历史名城的主要街道时，受到了北平人民如醉若狂的欢迎。最先入城的部队中有曾受到林彪将军通令嘉奖的“秋毫无犯团”及守备英雄团。最早赶到西直门欢迎的是北平电车厂工人的两辆欢迎车，接着铁路局、电讯局、工务局的员工们和北京大学、师范大学等校的学生们也乘着卡车赶来了。他们的手里都执着三角小旗高喊着欢迎口号，有的甚至伸出手来热情地握着挨身而过的解放军战士们的手。一路上由工人和学生组成的五彩缤纷的欢迎队伍逐渐增加，他们和解放军差不多是肩并肩地通过了新街口、西四牌楼、筇门、王府井大街、狮子胡同，两旁则是成千成万的欢呼的市民。当高挂着毛主席画像的宣传卡车通过时，人们都狂欢地挥掷着帽子，鼓着掌。有些人且在自己的身上用粉笔写上“解放了”字样，到处跳跃着。“毛主席万岁”的口号，此伏彼起，经久不息。下午五时，电讯局工人及北大、东大、辅仁、朝阳等十余学校的学生。共四千余人，又赶到中南海尖坛寺与人民解放军一部开了个盛大的联欢会。会上每一单位均推派代表向解放军勇士们致敬，现北平城内的鼓楼、景山、前门及内城的主要交通孔道均已由人民解放军设岗布防。原驻北平城内的二十余万之国民党军大部均已开赴城外的指定地点，以待依据民主原则实行改编。尚有少数傅部正络续出城中。迄发电时止，人民解放军正在继续入城。
