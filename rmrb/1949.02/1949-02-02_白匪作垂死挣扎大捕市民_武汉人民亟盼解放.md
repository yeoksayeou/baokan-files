Xinhua News Agency, Central Plains, 28th. The people of Wuhan are eagerly awaiting their swift liberation. The common topic of conversation among ordinary citizens and students is now, "When will Wuhan be liberated?" "When will the People's Liberation Army cross the river?" Citizens universally despise the fake Gold Yuan notes, saying, "The People's Liberation Army is coming soon, what use are Gold Yuan notes now?!" Professors and students at Wuhan University, Zhonghua University, and other schools are all opposed to moving south. One professor said, "Why bother moving to suffer? Like the Northeast students who entered the pass in the past and were shot by the reactionaries, it's not worth it!" Students have followed the example of students in Tianjin, Beijing, and other places in launching a "raising grain to protect the school" movement to prevent food shortages and protect the school from being destroyed by the Kuomintang, so that the school can resume classes as usual after liberation. Many professors at these schools have also adopted the same attitude as the students, expressing their determination to protect the school. Due to soaring prices, the lives of students and faculty in major middle schools have become difficult to sustain. Many students are selling their clothes to survive. Students who were deceived by the Kuomintang and fled to Wuhan are even worse off, many of them wandering the streets, even wearing only single layers of clothing. The lives of ordinary junior civil servants are also very difficult, as they have not been paid their monthly salaries and are constantly threatened with layoffs. The various desperate measures taken by the war criminal Bai Chongxi in Wuhan have deepened the suffering of the vast majority of citizens. For months, Bai's bandits have been driving citizens to rush to repair city defense works for them. On the 16th of this month, the Kuomintang authorities in Hankou conducted a general household registration inspection, dispatching more than 10,000 military police, harassing every household, and forcibly reissuing resident permits. More than a hundred citizens were also arrested and sent to fascist concentration camps. At the same time, many Kuomintang civil and military officials in Hankou are fleeing south in a panic. Military equipment and materials in Hankou are also being rushed south via the Yuehan Railway.

　　白匪作垂死挣扎大捕市民
  　武汉人民亟盼解放
    【新华社中原廿八日电】武汉人民亟盼迅速得到解放。现在一般市民和学生谈话的题材大都是“武汉几时才解放？”“解放军几时渡江？”市民已普遍厌恶伪金圆券，说：“解放军快来了，金圆券还有啥用？！”武汉大学、中华大学等学校的教授和学生们都反对南迁。一位教授说：“何苦搬家去受苦，象过去东北籍学生进关被反动派枪杀，才犯不着呢！”学生们已仿效过去平津等地学生的榜样，发动“筹粮保校”运动，以防止粮荒，保护学校不被国民党破坏，使学校能在解放后照常上课。这些学校的许多教授也同学生采一致态度，表示保护学校的决心。由于物价狂涨，各大中学学生和教职员的生活已困难到无法维持的地步。不少学生以拍卖衣物过活。被国民党欺骗流亡在武汉的学生更苦，很多都是流浪街头，甚至还穿着单衣。一般中小公务员生活也很苦，他们已领不到月薪，并且随时受着裁员的威胁。战犯白崇禧在武汉所进行的各种垂死挣扎的措施，更加深了广大市民的痛苦。数月以来，白匪即驱使市民为其赶修城防工事。本月十六日汉口国民党当局曾举行户口总检查，出动军警一万多人，家家户户都被骚扰，并强迫换发居民证，另有百余市民横遭逮捕，被送入法西斯集中营。与此同时，汉口许多国民党文武大员正在仓皇南逃。汉口的军事设备及物资也正在经粤汉路急忙南运。
