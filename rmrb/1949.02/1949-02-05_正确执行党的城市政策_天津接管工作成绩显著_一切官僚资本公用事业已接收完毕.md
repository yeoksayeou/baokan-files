　　Tianjin's Takeover Work Achieves Remarkable Results
　　All Bureaucratic Capital Public Utilities Have Been Taken Over
　　After the Takeover of "China Textile Corporation"
　　100,000 Spindles Begin to Turn
　　[Xinhua News Agency, Tianjin, 2nd] Thanks to the Tianjin Military Control Commission's correct implementation of the Chinese Communist Party's urban policy, significant achievements have been made in the takeover of all public institutions and public enterprises in Tianjin. On January 15th, before the battle to liberate Tianjin was completely over, the Military Control Commission was formally established and began operations in the urban area. After the battle ended, the Commission dispatched military representatives to designated units to systematically carry out the takeover work. Currently, all public utilities of the Kuomintang's bureaucratic capital in the city have been taken over. Among them, tap water, trams, and buses have fully returned to normal operation. Electricity and telephones have also been largely restored. Postal routes have been connected with all liberated areas. In terms of railway transportation, the Jinpu Railway has been opened to Chenguantun, and the Beining Railway has been opened to Shanhaiguan. The section between Pingjin has been opened to Fengtai. The factories and warehouses originally belonging to the Kuomintang's bureaucratic capital, which were taken over by the Military Control Commission, are mostly intact. These include light and heavy industries such as steelmaking, machinery, electrical engineering, chemicals, papermaking, textiles, flour, fuel, rubber, leather making, and clothing. After the takeover of the Tianjin branch of the Kuomintang's China Textile Construction Corporation, which owns more than 320,000 spindles, over 100,000 spindles have begun to turn. The Tianjin branch of the Central Machine Factory and the Tianjin Paper Industry Company have officially started operations. The four major banks of China, Central, Communications, and Farmers, as well as the Postal Savings and Remittance Bureau, the Central Trust Bureau, the Hebei Provincial Bank, the Tianjin Municipal Bank, the Cooperative Treasury, and more than ninety large and small factories operated by these banks, have all been completely taken over. Under the leadership of the Military Control Commission, some of the city's twenty-four public universities, colleges, and middle schools, including Nankai and Beiyang Universities, as well as over one hundred public primary schools, have already resumed classes, and the rest are preparing to resume classes. More than 1,000 faculty, staff, and students of Nankai University are currently engaged in a heated policy study movement. The Tianjin branch of the Central News Agency, the Tianjin Minguo Daily, and the Tianjin Central Broadcasting Station and other Kuomintang reactionary propaganda organs were also taken over by the Military Control Commission.
　　During the takeover process, the military representatives sent by the Military Control Commission would first explain the various policies in detail upon arrival at each location, and announce the takeover order of the Military Control Commission. They announced that all workers, staff, professors, and teachers of all factories and schools, except for a few die-hard counter-revolutionary secret agents and saboteurs, would be registered and employed separately, and ordered them to prepare various lists for handover. Railway employees were decided to temporarily retain their positions and salaries. The dismissed employees of the pseudo-municipal government were all registered and handed over for review and employment. As for general technical personnel, they have been working as usual since the takeover. Municipal hospitals have resumed outpatient services after the takeover. Traffic police appeared on the streets to direct traffic the day after the liberation of Tianjin.
　　In order to take care of the difficulties in the lives of employees in the factories taken over, the Military Control Commission has temporarily provided salary advances before the wage standards are determined. At the same time, the Commission allocated hundreds of thousands of catties of temporary relief grain to faculty and staff of universities, colleges, and specialized schools such as the French Business College and the Hebei Provincial Institute of Technology. For poor citizens, 3.9 million catties of relief grain were distributed for emergency relief. In terms of exchanging pseudo-gold yuan notes, the Military Control Commission specially stipulated a preferential exchange rate of three pseudo-gold yuan notes for one Renminbi yuan for workers, students, and staff (the general exchange rate was six pseudo-gold yuan notes for one Renminbi yuan).
　　The various democratic measures of the Military Control Commission and the People's Government, as well as their concern for workers, students, faculty, staff, and poor citizens, coupled with the strict discipline of the People's Liberation Army entering the city, quickly shattered all the deceptive propaganda carried out by the Kuomintang reactionaries in the past. Workers at the No. 3 Factory of the Jibei Electric Power Company said, "When the Communist Party came, they not only didn't dismantle the factory, but also repaired it. It's clear that the Kuomintang's propaganda is all lies." After the Tianjin Water Plant issued salary advances, a young worker said with satisfaction, "What I got in the first half of the month (referring to the time of the Kuomintang reactionary rule - editor) was not enough to buy a bag of flour. Now what I get is enough to buy three bags and more."
　　The smooth progress of the Tianjin takeover work this time is primarily due to the Military Control Commission's thorough preparations beforehand and the correct implementation of urban policies during the takeover. As early as one month before the liberation of Tianjin, the Military Control Commission concentrated a large number of cadres to conduct urban policy education, and preliminarily studied the situation of taking over various departments. Under the general policy of takeover work, the takeover plans for each unit were formulated, and special personnel were assigned to be responsible for the takeover according to departments. In terms of takeover methods, the method of top-down, according to system, and complete takeover was adopted, so that the entire takeover work was carried out in an orderly manner, and the restoration work could therefore be carried out quickly. Another factor is that the general workers, students, and middle and lower-level staff enthusiastically assisted the Military Control Commission in carrying out the takeover and restoration work. When an employee of the pseudo-Resources Committee Supply Depot discovered that the 9th warehouse was not taken over, he immediately reported to the military representative. In the restoration work, some workers at the Jibei Electric Power Company voluntarily insisted on rushing to repair work for more than twelve hours a day. In addition, due to the fact that the old personnel of the units taken over realized that the Kuomintang's reactionary rule across the country was about to collapse, and were also affected by the CCP's various policies, most of them quickly reported during the takeover, and some senior personnel did not flee. From top to bottom, no one left the pseudo-Central Bank, the Farmers Bank, and the Tianjin branch of the Kuomintang Central News Agency. The Tianjin Court had prepared various forms for handover at the end of last year.

　　正确执行党的城市政策
  　天津接管工作成绩显著
    一切官僚资本公用事业已接收完毕
    “中纺公司”接管后
    十万纱锭开始转动
    【新华社天津二日电】由于天津军事管制委员会正确执行了中国共产党的城市政策，天津市一切公共机关及公共企业的接管工作，获得重大成绩。一月十五日，解放津市的战斗尚未完全结束，军管会即在市区正式宣告成立，开始办公。战斗结束后，该会即派出军事代表分赴各指定单位，开始有系统地进行接管工作。刻市内一切国民党官僚资本的公用事业，已接收完毕，其中自来水、电车、公共汽车已完全恢复常态，电力、电话亦已大部修复，邮路已与各解放区接通。铁路交通方面，津浦路已通至陈官屯，北宁路已通至山海关，其平津段已通至丰台。军管会所接管的原属国民党官僚资本的工厂和仓库，大部完好无损。其中包括炼钢、机器、电工、化学、造纸、纺织、面粉、燃料、橡胶、制革、被服等轻重工业。拥有三十二万余枚纱锭的国民党中国纺织建设公司天津分公司所属各厂，经接管后已有十万余枚纱锭开始转动。中央机器厂天津分厂、天津纸业公司等已正式开工。中国、中央、交通、农民四大银行及邮政储金汇业局、中央信托局、河北省银行、天津市银行、合作金库以及这些银行经营的大小九十多个工厂，均已完整接收。包括南开、北洋两大学在内的全市二十四个公立的大学专科学校和中学及一百个以上的公立小学，在军管会的领导下，部分已经上课，其余亦正筹备复课中，南开大学一千多师生员工，刻正展开热烈的政策学习运动。中央通讯社天津分社、天津民国日报及天津中央广播电台等国民党反动宣传机关，亦同时为军管会派员接收。
    在进行接管中，军管会所派军事代表每至一处，即首先详细解释各项政策，并宣布军管会接管命令。宣布一切工厂、学校的工人、职员、教授、教员，除个别坚决反革命的特务破坏分子外，均将分别登记录用，并命其造具各项清册，进行交代。铁路员工决定暂时原职原薪。被解散的伪市政府机关职员，已一律于登记后办理交代，听候甄别录用。至于一般技术人员，则已于接管后照常工作。市立各医院在接管后已恢复门诊。交通警察于津市解放次日即出现街头指挥交通。
    为照顾各接管工厂中职工的生活困难，在工资标准未确定前，军管会已暂予借支薪金。同时该会并拨发临时救济粮数十万斤分配给法商学院、河北省立工学院等大中及专科学校的教职员工。对于贫苦市民，则发放救济粮三百九十万斤进行急赈。在兑换伪金圆券方面，军管会对于工人、学生、职员特规定伪金元券三元兑人民券一元的优待比价（一般比价为伪金元券六元兑人民券一元）。
    军管会与人民政府的各项民主措施及其对工人、学生、教职员和贫苦市民的关心，加上入城解放军严明的纪律，迅速粉碎了国民党反动派过去进行的一切欺骗宣传。冀北电力公司三厂的工人说：“共产党来了，不但没拆厂，而且还修理，可见国民党的宣传尽是造谣。”天津自来水厂发下借支薪金后，一个青年工人满意地说：“上半月（按即国民党反动统治时——编者）拿的钱不够买一袋面，现在拿的钱够买三袋还多。”
    此次津市接管工作所以能顺利进行，首先是由于军管会在事前做了充分的准备工作，在接管中又正确地执行了城市政策。早在津市解放的一个月以前，军管会即集中大批干部进行城市政策教育，同时初步研究了接管各部门的情况，在接管工作的总方针下，制定了各单位的按管计划，并按部门指定专人分别负责接管，在接管方法上，采用了自上而下，各按系统，整个接收的办法，使整个接收工作有条不紊，恢复工作也因此能迅速进行。另外一个因素，则是一般工人、学生和中下级职员热烈地协助军管会进行接管及恢复工作。伪资源委员会供给库的一个职员，当发现第九仓库无人接管时，立刻自动向军事代表报告。在恢复工作中，冀北电力公司有的工人自动坚持抢修工作每日超过十二小时。此外还由于被接管各单位的旧有人员，鉴于国民党在全国的反动统治覆亡在即，又受到中共各种政策的影响，在接管中大部迅速报到，某些高级人员也未逃匿。伪中央银行、农民银行及国民党中央社天津分社，从上到下没有一人离去。天津法院则在去年底即造好各项表册准备交代。
