Yicheng County Cooperative Establishes Sixteen Breeding Stations
  Organizes the Masses to Breed Livestock
    Over 500 Breedings in One Year
    [Our Newspaper] To overcome the shortage of livestock in the development of agricultural production, the Yicheng County Cooperative in Taiyue has achieved great success in rewarding livestock breeding. In July of last year, the county cooperative convened a meeting of district and village cadres, calling on the masses to feed stallions, breeding bulls, and male donkeys, widely publicizing the reward methods for breeding livestock, and specifically organizing the masses to establish sixteen livestock breeding stations throughout the county. A total of 90 horses, 692 donkeys, 51 cattle were bred, and a total of 583 donkey, horse, and cattle foals were bred. In order to improve breeding work, the county cooperative also convened a meeting of managers of various breeding stations in November last year to summarize and exchange experiences, and discussed further methods for breeding livestock in the future: 1. Organize the masses to pool shares to buy stallions, breeding bulls, and male donkeys in a planned and focused manner. If they are unable to do so, the bank can provide low-interest loans to support them. At the same time, call on the masses to buy mares, cows, and female donkeys for breeding. 2. Conduct education on organizing production and breeding livestock, change public opinion, overcome the feudal idea among farmers that "breeding skills are shameful," raise the social status of "breeding technicians," and publicize that only by breeding livestock can production be improved. 3. The wage treatment of "breeding technicians" in breeding stations should be based on the principle of mutual benefit between labor and capital. For "breeding technicians" operating in partnerships, after deducting the consumption of people and livestock, profits should be divided between labor and capital at a ratio of 40/60 (40% for labor and 60% for capital) to improve the living standards of "breeding technicians" and encourage their work enthusiasm. 4. Breeding stations operating in partnerships should establish a system of regular accounting and periodic profit distribution. 5. Protect breeding livestock and pay attention to disease prevention and treatment. It is best to eat more black beans, boil them when feeding, let the breeding livestock drink more salt water, and give them some traditional Chinese medicine after several breedings to prevent illness. Breeding livestock should preferably not be used for heavy work (such as pulling heavy carts or grinding grain) to avoid affecting breeding.

　　翼城县联社建立十六处配种所
  　组织群众繁殖牲畜
    一年配种五百余个
    【本报讯】太岳翼城县联社为克服发展农业生产中牲畜不足的困难，奖励繁殖牲畜，已获得很大成绩。去年七月间该县社曾召开区、村干部会议，号召群众喂公马、种牛、叫驴，广泛宣传了繁殖牲畜的奖励办法，并具体组织群众，在全县先后建立了牲畜配种所十六处，共计配马九十匹、驴六百九十二匹、配牛五十一头、配准下驹的驴、马、牛共计有五百八十三个。为改进配种工作，县社又于去年十一月召开了各配种所经理会议，总结交流经验，并讨论出今后进一步繁殖牲畜的办法：一、有计划有重点的组织群众集股买公马、＠牛、叫驴，如有力不能及者，银行可低利贷款扶植。同时号召群众买母马、母牛、驴，以便繁殖。二、进行组织生产、繁殖牲畜的教育，改变社会舆论，克服农民中“配种把式丢人”的封建思想，提高“配种把式”的社会地位，宣传只有繁殖牲畜，才能搞好生产。三、对配种所中“配种把式”的工资待遇，应本劳资两利的原则。合伙经营的“配种把式”，除去人和牲口吃喝消费以外，按劳资四六分红（劳四成资六成），以提高“配种把式”的生活待遇，鼓励其工作热情。四、合伙经营的配种所，要建立定期算帐，按期分红制度。五、保护种畜，注意疾病的调养。最好多吃黑豆，喂时要煮一煮，多让种畜喝盐水，配种数次后，要灌些中药，防止生病，种畜最好不使重活（如拉重车、拉磨等），以免影响配种。
