　　Xinhua News Agency, North China, 20th -- The Youth Work Committee of the Hebei-Central District Committee of the Chinese Communist Party has now released a summary of youth work in Hebei-Central last year. The summary points out: In 1948, youth work in Hebei-Central, on the basis of land reform, in the central tasks of autumn harvest, wheat planting, autumn grain requisition, concluding land reform, rectifying the Party, and supporting the front lines, first completed the task of establishing the New Democratic Youth League with a focus, and has begun to gradually promote national construction work.

　　During the land reform movement last spring, Ding County and Xinle County in Hebei-Central began to establish the New Democratic Youth League with a focus. When the news of the establishment of the League in Ding County was first published in the "Hebei-Central Guide," some local youth activists actively requested to organize and establish the New Democratic Youth League. After the enlarged meeting of youth cadres in September, all counties began to establish the League with a focus. According to preliminary statistics as of the end of last December: In Hebei-Central, 34 counties and cities, 284 villages, 5 middle schools, and 3 factories have established the New Democratic Youth League; there are a total of 294 branches with 8,999 members. In addition, preparatory committees for the New Democratic Youth League have been established in 14 counties and cities, including Shen County and Hejian.

　　The method of establishing the League with a focus in various counties is to mobilize, educate, and organize youth to produce in order to complete the various central tasks at the time, raise their awareness, and establish the New Democratic Youth League on the basis of their willingness. For example, in Dafengying Village in Shen County, after Zhu Yuchao's production mutual aid group was commended, the youths organized themselves to participate in the mutual aid group. Out of the 215 youths in the village, 114 participated in the mutual aid group. Moreover, during the autumn grain requisition work in Dafengying Village last year, 35 members of the New Democratic Youth League took 16 youths to automatically participate in carrying cloth bags, weighing, and operating the winnowing machine, so that the public grain of all 408 peasant households in the village was fully paid within two and a half days. Another example is that the 62 youths in Sanqiu Village, Gaocheng County, planted 85 more mu of wheat than in previous years after being organized.

　　In the work of concluding land reform, 998 youths (37% of the total) in the 15 key national construction villages in Hejian County participated in various meetings to discuss issues such as distributing floating wealth and houses. When issuing land certificates, the youths in each village who could write and calculate actively participated in filling out the land certificates. In the rectification of the Party, 51 of the 273 representatives in the 12 key Party rectification villages in Hejian County were youths. In the work of supporting the front lines, the youths actively participated in road repairs and visiting the wounded, playing a significant role. For example, the Youth League of Baitong Village and Chita Village in Hejian County led 80% of the youths in the village to participate in rushing to repair the Beijing-Daming Highway, which was repaired smoothly and well. In addition, in the 15 Youth League branches in Hejian, 55 youths with bad styles were corrected under the education of the branch. Therefore, people said, "With the Youth League, the youths are taken care of." In this way, the counties started building the League with a focus while completing various central tasks, and gradually promoted the work of building the League with conditions.

　　The summary, when mentioning the shortcomings of youth work in Hebei-Central in the past year, points out: First, the mobilization of youth is not extensive enough. Only circling among these youth activists and failing to resolve the special needs of the youth. In the future, it is necessary to continue to mobilize the broad masses of youth to participate in central work and pay attention to resolving the special needs of the youth. Second, the education of youth in the past generally focused on labor, production, and the education of proper style, and was welcomed by the masses. In the future, it is necessary to systematically improve the political education, class education, and organizational education of the Youth League for the youth; especially education on participating in war and joining the army, in order to meet the needs of a portion of youth activists in the countryside. Third, in the method of building the League, attention should be paid to avoiding the method of collective joining. It is necessary to follow organizational principles and let the youths voluntarily sign up, then individually absorb them and complete the joining procedures. At the same time, in the future, it is even more necessary to lead and organize youths' learning, production, and entertainment according to the needs of the youths, and truly make the League the core of the broad masses of youth, so that it can play a vanguard and exemplary role in various tasks.

### 在生产与结束土改中发动青年　冀中逐步推广建团

　　在生产与结束土改中发动青年
  　冀中逐步推广建团
    【新华社华北二十日电】中共冀中区党委青年工作委员会，现在发表去年冀中青年工作的总结。总结指出：一九四八年冀中的青年工作，是在土地改革的基础上，在秋收、种麦、秋季征粮、结束土改、整党、支援前线等项中心工作中，首先完成了有重点地建立新民主主义青年团的任务，并已开始逐步推广建国工作。
    在去年春天的土地改革运动中，冀中定县、新乐两县就开始进行有重点地建立新民主主义青年团。当定县建团消息最先在“冀中导报”刊出后，有些地方青年积极分子，纷纷要求组织起来，建立新民主主义青年团。到九月青年干部扩大会议后，各县都开始了有重点地建团。截至去年十二月底止的初步统计：全冀中已有三十四个县市，二百八十四个村庄，五个中学，三个工厂建立了新民主主义青年团；共有二百九十四个支部，八千九百九十九个团员。此外，并在深县、河间等十四个县市建立新民主主义青年团筹备委员会。
    各县有重点地建团的办法，是在完成当时的各种中心工作中，发动、教育和组织青年生产，提高他们的觉悟，并在他们自愿的基础上把新民主主义青年团建立起来。如深县大冯营村，在表扬了朱玉朝的生产互助组后，青年们便先后组织起来参加互助组。全村二百十五个青年，就有一百十四个参加了互助组。而大冯营村在去年秋征工作中，更有三十五个新民主主义青年团员，带着十六个青年自动参加扛布袋、过秤、扇风车等，使全村四百零八户农民的公粮，在两天半内就全部缴齐。又如藁城县三邱村的六十二个青年，在组织起来以后，比往年多种了八十五亩麦子。
    在结束土地改革的工作中，河间县的十五个建国重点村里，有九百九十八个青年（占总数百分之三十七），参加各种会议，讨论分浮财、分房子等问题。在发土地证时，各村能写字会算的青年们，都积极参加填写土地证。在整党中，河间县十二个整党重点村的二百七十三个代表中，有五十一名是青年。在支援前线工作中，青年们积极参加修路和慰问伤员等工作，起了很大作用。如河间县柏桐村、赤塔村的青年团，带动了村子里百分之八十的青年参加赶修北平大名公路，修的又平又好。另外，在河间十五个团支部中，有五十五个作风不好的青年，在支部的教育下改正过来。因此，人们便说：“有了青年团，青年们就有人管了。”这样，各县就由完成各种中心工作中有重点地开始建团，有条件地逐步推广了建团工作。
    总结在提到冀中一年来青年工作存在的缺点时，指出：首先是发动青年不够广泛。只在这些青年积极分子中打圈子，并且没有解决青年的特殊要求。今后必须继续发动广大青年参加中心工作，注意解决青年特殊要求。其次，对青年的教育，过去一般地是注意了劳动、生产、作风正派的教育，并受到群众的欢迎。今后必须有计划地提高对青年的政治教育、阶级教育和青年团的组织教育；特别是参战参军教育，以满足农村中一部分青年积极分子的要求。第三，在建团方法上，要注意避免集体入团的办法。必须根据组织原则由青年自觉的报名，然后个别吸收，履行入团手续。同时，今后更必须根据青年的要求去领导组织青年学习、生产、娱乐等，把团真正成为广大青年群众的核心，在各种工作中能起先锋模范作用。
