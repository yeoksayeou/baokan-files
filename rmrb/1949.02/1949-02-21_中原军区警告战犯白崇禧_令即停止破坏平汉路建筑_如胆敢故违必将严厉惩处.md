Xinhua News Agency, Central Plains, 19th – Reliable sources state that the bandit Ministry of National Defense and the bandit "Commander-in-Chief of the Central China剿匪" Bai Chongxi secretly ordered the engineer regiment stationed in Wuhan on February 12th to carry a large quantity of explosives to the Xinyang area of the southern section of the Pinghan Railway. They were to collaborate with Zhang Zhen, commander of the bandit's Fifth Pacification District, to destroy the Wusheng Pass tunnel south of Xinyang and the Changtaiguan Huai River Bridge north of Xinyang when the bandit troops retreated. In response, a spokesman for the People's Liberation Army's Central Plains Military Region issued a serious warning to the bandit Ministry of National Defense and the bandit Bai Chongxi, stating: The Wusheng Pass tunnel and the Changtaiguan Huai River Bridge are both important structures on the Pinghan Railway and are of great importance to north-south transportation in China. The bogus Ministry of National Defense of the Nanjing Kuomintang government and "Commander-in-Chief of the Central China剿匪" Bai Chongxi must immediately cancel the criminal plan to destroy these important structures or other facilities on the Pinghan Railway. Zhang Zhen and the engineer regiment must immediately cease the execution of this criminal plan. If Bai Chongxi, Zhang Zhen, and others disregard the warning and dare to destroy the important structures in this section, they will be severely punished without leniency when captured and brought to justice in the future.

　　中原军区警告战犯白崇禧
    令即停止破坏平汉路建筑
  　如胆敢故违必将严厉惩处
    【新华社中原十九日电】确息：匪国防部及匪“华中剿匪总司令”白崇禧于二月十二日曾密令驻武汉之工兵团，携带大批炸药开至平汉路南段信阳地区，协同匪第五绥区司令张轸，准备于匪军撤退时，将平汉铁路南段信阳以南的武胜关隧道及信阳以北的长台关淮河大桥加以破坏。对此，人民解放军中原军区发言人特向匪国防部及白匪崇禧提出严重警告称：武胜关隧道及长台关淮河大桥，均为平汉铁路重要建筑，对中国南北交通，关系极大。南京国民党政府的伪国防部及“华中剿匪总司令”白崇禧，必须即日取消破坏此等重要建筑或平汉路其他设备的罪恶计划。张轸及该工兵团必须即日停止对此罪恶计划之执行。如白崇禧、张轸等不顾警告，胆敢破坏该段重要建筑时，将来缉获归案，必将严厉惩处，决不姑宽。
