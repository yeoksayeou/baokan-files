Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 26th: The China Association for Promoting Democracy issued a declaration on the 22nd to strive for lasting peace. The full text is as follows:

We must first state that China's lasting peace must be built on the foundation of genuine democracy. There is no doubt about this. We also understand that genuine democracy must be reflected in the actual lives of the people throughout the country, and that the people throughout the country must have a standard of living. Their right to life must be completely in their own hands, not bestowed upon them by the exploiting class as a "minimum standard of living," and they must not always be dominated by the exploiting class. We believe that this is what the vast majority of the Chinese people want to say in their hearts.

A backward agricultural country, under the control of imperialism, the exploitation of feudal remnants, and the oppression of bureaucratic capital, cannot achieve the goal of the people completely controlling their right to life and enjoying a standard of living without taking the path of a thorough anti-imperialist, anti-feudal, and anti-bureaucratic-capital revolution. We once took a step back for the sake of the lives of the vast majority of the people who maintained their lives through painful labor, and their meager property, that is, we mildly called for democracy and peace. We clearly knew that it was impossible to ask for our lives back from the mouths of tigers and wolves, yet we still wanted to obtain a standard of living so easily? After the facts naturally gave us a negative answer, we had to shoulder the inevitable revolutionary task. Only the Chinese Communist Party has long shouldered the historical task and is leading the people's liberation revolution. The vast majority of the Chinese people have also become politically aware. In the struggle against imperialism, feudalism, and bureaucratic capitalism in the past two years, the people's strength has been greatly strengthened. Chiang Kai-shek, the head of the Nanjing dictatorial regime, a lackey of American imperialism, has exhausted his ruling magic weapon—military police, baojia system, secret agents, and inhuman means of killing—but he has not been able to make the people fear him. On the contrary, the people's strength and the bravery of the People's Liberation Army have driven him to the brink of destruction.

At a time when the people's liberation revolution is about to achieve complete success, and genuine democracy and lasting peace are about to be fully realized, it is also the most terrifying time for the leader of world imperialism—the reactionary American government and its lackey Chiang Kai-shek. They will naturally do their best to hinder our victory. However, the US imperialists' methods of assisting Chiang Kai-shek through military and economic means have completely failed. In the past half year or so, their various conspiracies under the banner of peace have been discovered and destroyed. They only have two last poisonous schemes: one is to try to mix pseudo-democratic revolutionary elements into our camp to do sabotage and disruption work; the other is to beg for international intervention. However, we believe that we have learned from the incomplete lessons of the Xinhai Revolution and the Northern Expedition, we have seen the vast sacrifices of the people this time, we are united under the goal of the anti-imperialist, anti-feudal, and anti-bureaucratic-capital people's liberation revolution, and we must thoroughly and consistently cooperate until the final success. We must never allow a reactionary element to gain a foothold in our camp, or put forward a middle road or imagine a middle road slogan or proposition.

Chiang Kai-shek, the lackey of American imperialism, in his New Year's Day statement, blindly talked about "national independence," "national spirit," and "protecting the country and the race," but on the 8th, he begged the United States, Britain, France, and the Soviet Union to intervene in China, attempting to prevent the forward development of revolutionary forces and save his doomed fate. This is enough to prove that he is a traitorous lackey without propriety, justice, integrity, and a sense of shame. However, the Soviet government, which has always advocated non-interference in the internal affairs of other countries, has clearly refused. But we must also solemnly declare to all countries in the world: the people of all countries have the right to decide everything for themselves. The establishment of a people's democratic republic by the Chinese people is the Chinese people's own business and must not accept any foreign interference. Otherwise, all consequences will be borne by the country that originally interfered.

Chiang Kai-shek, the lackey of American imperialism, also wanted to restore peace in his New Year's Day statement in order to maintain his dictatorial state system, puppet constitution, feudal orthodoxy, and reactionary army. Mr. Mao Zedong, Chairman of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China, in his statement on the current situation on the 14th of this month, has exposed his hypocritical peace and reactionary conspiracy, and also put forward eight conditions for a truly people's democratic peace: 1. Punish war criminals; 2. Abolish the pseudo-constitution; 3. Abolish the pseudo-orthodoxy; 4. Reorganize all reactionary armies according to democratic principles; 5. Confiscate bureaucratic capital; 6. Reform the landsystem; 7. Abolish traitorous treaties; 8. Convene a political consultative conference without the participation of reactionary elements, establish a democratic coalition government, and take over all powers of the Nanjing Kuomintang reactionary government and its affiliated governments at all levels. We believe that these conditions are in line with the demands of the people throughout the country, and are also the basic requirements of a truly people's democratic peace, and also the minimum requirements of the people who have made great sacrifices. In addition to expressing our extreme agreement, we also believe that the people throughout the country unanimously support these conditions, and we also ask the Communist Party of China, the People's Liberation Army, the people throughout the country, all democratic parties, all people's organizations, and all democratic figures to unite consistently and quickly to realize all these conditions, and not allow the Nanjing Kuomintang reactionary group to mistakenly believe that it is an equal negotiation with room for bargaining. It must unconditionally accept all eight items before it can be considered the realization of people's democratic peace and the cessation of combat.

The purpose of this revolution is to enable the vast majority of the oppressed people in China to turn themselves over so that a new China can be established. On May 1st of last year, the Communist Party of China issued a statement calling on all democratic parties, people's organizations, and democratic figures to convene a political consultative conference and establish a coalition government. This is a necessary procedure in the process of revolutionary progress and also a manifestation of the Communist Party of China's lack of selfishness. Now that the situation has progressed to the point of realizing this procedure, the headquarters of our China Association for Promoting Democracy has also temporarily moved to the liberated areas. We only see the Communist Party of China working hard for the people, and we only see them being supported by the people. The liberated areas are full of new atmosphere, which fills us with new hope for the new China. We sincerely express that we hope that the Communist Party of China will strongly lead the people throughout the country to create a new, beautiful, happy, peaceful, unified, and democratic China. We have decided to cooperate unanimously to complete the task of this revolution.

### 中国民主促进会发表宣言　支持毛主席八项和平条件

　　中国民主促进会发表宣言
  　支持毛主席八项和平条件
    【新华社陕北二十六日电】中国民主促进会于二十二日发表为争取永久和平的宣言，全文如下：
    我们先要说明的是：中国永久的和平，必须建筑在真正的民主的基础上面。这是一点也没有可疑的。我们又了解到真正的民主，必须表现在全国人民的实际生活上，必须全国人民得到标准的生活。他们的生活权完全把握在他们自己手里，不是由剥削阶级赐给他们一种“最低生活水准”，老是受着剥削阶级的支配的。我们相信，这是中国绝大多数的人民的心里要说的话。
    一个落后的农业国家，在帝国主义的支配、封建残余的剥削、官僚资本的压迫底下，不是走彻底的反帝、反封建、反官僚资本的革命的路子，要想达到人民自己完全把握着生活权，享受标准的生活的目的，是绝对不可能的。我们曾经为了全国绝大多数的人民在痛苦劳动里保持着的生命，和他们的些微财产，做过退一步的工作，就是温和地呼吁民主、和平。我们明明知道向虎狼口里要求还给我们的生命已是不可能的，还想这样容易地得到标准的生活吗？事实自然地给了我们一个否定的答复后，我们也只有担上必然的革命任务。唯中国共产党早经担起了历史的任务，领导着人民解放的革命。中国绝大多数的人民也有了政治的自觉，在最近两年多来反帝、反封建、反官僚资本的斗争中间，人民的力量高度地壮大了。美帝国主义的奴才国民党反动派首脑南京独裁政权蒋介石，把他统治的法宝——军警、保甲、特务和没有一些人道的杀人手段都用尽了，已不能使人民怕他，反过来，人民的力量和人民解放军的英勇，已驱逐他到了灭亡的边缘。
    在人民解放的革命将要全面成功，真正的民主和永久的和平将要全部实现的时候，也正是世界帝国主义的领导者——美国反动政府和他的奴才蒋介石最恐怖的时候，他们自然要尽他们的力量，来阻碍我们的胜利。但是美帝国主义者用军事、经济的方法来援助蒋介石，已彻底失败了；这大半年来，他们在和平的口号底下种种的阴谋，又被发现摧毁了。他们只有末了两个毒计：一是想把伪民主革命分子混入我们的阵营里，来做搅乱和破坏的工作；二是央求国际的干涉。可是，我们相信，我们经过辛亥和北伐两次革命不彻底的教训，我们眼底这次人民牺牲的广大，我们这次团结在反帝、反封建、反官僚资本的人民解放革命的目标底下，我们必须彻底一致合作到最后的成功，决不使我们的阵营里有一个反动分子可以立脚，和提出一个中间路线或是想象中间路线的口号和主张。
    美帝的奴才蒋介石正在元旦发表他闭眼瞎说的文告里，说什么“国家独立”、“民族精神”和“保国卫种”的话，却在八日就央求美、英、法、苏来干涉中国，企图阻止革命力量的向前发展，挽救他将被灭亡的命运。这足够证明了他是没有礼、义、廉、耻的卖国奴才。可是一向主张不干涉他国内政的苏联政府，已明白地拒绝了。但是我们也得严正地向世界各国声明：各国人民有自己决定他们的一切的权利，中国人民的建立人民民主共和国，是中国人民自己分内的事，决不能接受任何外国的干涉。否则，一切后果由原来干涉的国家自己负责。
    美帝的奴才蒋介石，又在他的元旦文告里，为了维持他的独裁国体、御用宪法、封建法统、反动军队，要恢复和平。中国共产党中央委员会主席毛泽东先生在本月十四日发表的时局声明中，已把他的虚伪的和平，反动的阴谋都揭开了，还提出了真正人民民主和平的八个条件：一、惩办战争罪犯；二、废除伪宪法；三、废除伪法统；四、依据民主原则，改编一切反动军队；五、没收官僚资本；六、改革土地制度；七、废除卖国条约；八、召开没有反动分子参加的政治协商会议，成立民主联合政府，接收南京国民党反动政府及其所属各级政府一切权力。我们认为这些条件都是和全国人民的要求相符合的，也是真正人民民主的和平的基本的要求，也是被广大牺牲的人民最低的要求。除表示我们极端的同意，还相信全国人民也一致地支持这些条件，并要请中国共产党、人民解放军和全国人民、各民主党派、各人民团体、各民主人士一致联合起来，坚决迅速实现这全部条件，不叫南京国民党反动集团错认为对等的和谈，有讨价还价的地步。必须无条件全部接受这八项，才可认为人民民主和平的实现，停止战斗的进行。
    这次革命的目的，是要使中国绝大多数被压迫的人民翻过身来，才可以建立新中国。上年五月一日中国共产党发表文告要各民主党派、各人民团体、各民主人士召开政治协商会议，成立联合政府。这是革命进展过程里一定该有的一种程序，也是中国共产党没有私心的表现。现在局势进展到了实现这项程序的时候，我们中国民主促进会的总部也暂时移到解放区了。我们只见中国共产党在替人民苦干，只见他们被人民的拥护。解放区里充满着新气象，使我们充满了新中国的新希望。我们诚心的表示，我们希望中国共产党坚强地领导全国人民，造成一个新的、美的、快乐的、和平的、统一的、民主的中国。我们决定一致的合作，完成这次革命的任务。
