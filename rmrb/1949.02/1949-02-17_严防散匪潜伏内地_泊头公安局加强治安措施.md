Strictly Prevent Scattered Bandits from Lurking in the Mainland
Botou Public Security Bureau Strengthens Security Measures

[Jizhong News] In order to prevent fleeing Kuomintang officers and soldiers from escaping in disguise, and to prevent Kuomintang agents from hiding in our area to carry out sabotage activities, the Botou Public Security Bureau has decided on specific measures and convened an expanded cadre meeting to convey them.

(1) All departments should mobilize and educate their lower-level organizations, conduct necessary investigations and understanding of people returning to their hometowns from enemy-occupied areas or newly liberated areas, understand their actions and performance, and prevent Kuomintang agents from infiltrating our area. Educate the masses to strengthen vigilance and pay attention to exposing various rumors, and conduct rumor tracing when necessary.

(2) Strengthen household registration management, strictly control household registration changes, and investigate people with unclear origins. For special business households (such as passenger and freight stations, hotels, etc.), designate special personnel to specifically control and understand the situation of incoming and outgoing travelers. Strengthen education for shop owners, conduct planned inspections, and give appropriate criticism or punishment to shop owners who conceal information or act ambiguously.

(3) Strengthen patrol and inspection work. Each police station should lead the militia in planned patrols day and night, and maintain a certain number of sentry posts at all important road junctions. Cadres and personnel of the Municipal Public Security Bureau should strengthen their work.

Finally, it was emphasized that although the liberation of Tianjin and Beijing will deal a fatal blow to the Kuomintang's espionage work, it does not mean complete elimination. Therefore, it is necessary to prevent the blind optimism and negligent and careless erroneous thinking of some cadres who believe that "agents will not dare to act" after the liberation of Tianjin and Beijing.

　　严防散匪潜伏内地
  　泊头公安局加强治安措施
    【冀中讯】为了不让国民党溃散官兵化装逃跑，和国民党特务潜藏在我区进行破坏活动，泊头公安局决定具体措施，并召开扩大干部会议进行传达。
    （一）各部门对自己的下层组织进行动员教育，对从敌占区或新解放区还乡的人要进行必要的审查了解，了解他们的行动表现，防止国民党特务潜入我区。教育群众加强警惕和注意揭穿各种谣言，必要时进行追谣。
    （二）加强户籍管理，严格掌握户口变动，审查来历不清的人。对特种营业户口（如客货栈旅店等）要确定专人，专门掌握和了解来往旅客的情况。加强对店主的教育，有计划的进行检查，对隐瞒不报或模糊从事的店主，要给以适当的批评或处分。
    （三）加强巡逻盘查工作。各派出所要有计划的带领民兵，进行昼夜巡逻，各要路口保持一定的岗哨。市公安局干部人员，应加强自己的工作。
    最后强调指出：解放平津虽然会给国民党特务工作以致命的打击，但不是等于完全消灭。因此必须防止某些干部认为平津解放后“特务就不敢活动了”的盲目乐观和麻痹大意的错误思想发生。
