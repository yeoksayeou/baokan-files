Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, January 3rd Telegram: TASS Moscow, January 28th – The Soviet Ministry of Foreign Affairs has issued a statement regarding the North Atlantic Treaty. Excerpts of the original text are as follows:

On January 14th, the U.S. Department of State issued a lengthy statement under the straightforward title of "Establishing Peace and Collective Security in the North Atlantic Region." This official document outlines the U.S. attitude towards the so-called "North Atlantic Treaty." Since last summer, the U.S. government has been conducting negotiations on this treaty with Canada and the governments of the United Kingdom, France, Belgium, the Netherlands, and Luxembourg. In 1948, the ruling groups of the aforementioned five Western European countries, under the guise of collective defense and with the protection of the United States, formed a military and political alliance. This year, the long-term U.S.-British plan to establish a "North Atlantic Alliance" is being implemented with the participation of the aforementioned European countries and Canada, and under the direct leadership of the United States.

　　I. Western European Union – A Weapon of the U.S.-British Aggressive Bloc in Europe

In March 1948, the United Kingdom, France, Belgium, the Netherlands, and Luxembourg signed the Treaty of Mutual Assistance and Collective Defence in Brussels, which laid the foundation for a splinter group of certain Western European countries, the so-called "Western European Union." The treaty stipulates that other European countries can be incorporated into this alliance if they are willing to adjust their policies to suit the purposes of the aforementioned group, which is headed by the United Kingdom.

It is known to all that the founders of the Western European Union initially blocked the possibility of all People's Democratic countries and the Soviet Union participating in the alliance. This exposed that the composition of the Western European Union was not for uniting the peace-loving countries of Europe, nor was it in line with the interests of ensuring peace in the entire Europe, but had other purposes. These purposes have nothing in common with a concern for strengthening peace and international security.

It is not difficult to see that the establishment of the Western European Union primarily indicates a complete change in the policies held by the United Kingdom and France on the German question. Moreover, it proves that the governments of these countries have abandoned the democratic and anti-aggression policies towards Germany adopted by the anti-Hitler allied countries at the Yalta and Potsdam Conferences. They have adopted new policies extremely detrimental to peace-loving countries, aimed at establishing control over other countries in Europe. For this purpose, they do not hesitate to utilize yesterday's aggressors, who, since the end of the war, have become their vassals. Nothing else can explain why the British and French governments are now working with the U.S. government to try to utilize West Germany, even though the Brussels Treaty makes a passing reference to the desire to prevent the revival of German aggression policies.

The establishment of a military alliance of the five Western countries is less for dealing with Germany and more for using the group of Western countries they have already formed to oppose their allies in World War II. Moreover, it is now sufficiently clear that under the pretext of preventing situations that would endanger the so-called "economic stability" of the signatories of the treaty, they are preparing to adopt military measures and various repressive methods to deal with the domestic working class, the growing democratic forces, and the national liberation movements in colonies and dependent countries. It is no accident that the Brussels Treaty is an alliance of colonial countries. In order to maintain their centuries-old privileges in the colonies, these countries want to use the military and political combination now launched to suppress the national liberation movements in these colonies. All of this powerfully demonstrates the anti-democratic and aggressive reactionary nature of the Western European Union.

The contradiction between this political plan of the U.S.-British bloc and the concern for peace and the realization of democratic principles in European countries is very obvious. When the Western European Union first emerged last March, the U.S. ruling group immediately declared that it would provide various kinds of support to this alliance. Now, it is clear to everyone that the faster and further the Western European Union countries go on the road against the People's Democratic countries and the Soviet Union, the more politically and economically dependent the Western European countries become on the U.S. ruling group, which is not at all concerned about the political independence and economic revival of European countries. The result will be an aggravation of contradictions between the United States and the countries of the Western European group, as well as within the Western European group itself. The Western European group is not based on a sound or solid foundation for economic revival. This group is auxiliary in nature, as can be seen from the broader union of European countries established by "Marshallized" countries. This union of European countries not only fails to provide any real help to the participating countries, but also does not prevent the increasing economic difficulties of many Western European countries. The aggressive goals of the Western European group are also reflected in the ever-increasing demands for more troops and more military spending, which increasingly undermine their hopes for stable economic progress. At the same time, this situation intensifies the serious political difficulties within these countries.

The Western Union has so far used quite a few methods to shape the form of its organization. As early as last spring, with the establishment of the Consultative Committee, a permanent body of the alliance was established in London, composed of representatives from the five countries. They also established a military committee, even the headquarters of the Western European Union, composed of the chiefs of staff of the five countries, headed by British Field Marshal Montgomery. In the current peaceful situation, the hasty completion of these organizational tasks, including the establishment of a headquarters, certainly does not prove that the participants of the Western European group have any desire to ensure lasting peace in Europe. The flurry of activity surrounding the completion of all these tasks proves that their purpose is to exert political pressure on certain European countries, including West Germany, and to promote the participation of these countries in the Western group by means of the propaganda hype surrounding all this work. At the same time, they are creating a sense of panic and war mania among the public in European countries. This is one of the main tactics currently employed by the U.S.-British bloc in Europe to promote its aggressive policies. In addition to establishing the Western European Union in Europe, the U.S.-British ruling group has also been engaged in establishing the North Atlantic Alliance composed of the same five countries, Canada, and the United States for the past two months. The purpose of the North Atlantic Alliance is far greater than that of the Western European Union. It is obvious that this purpose is closely intertwined with the U.S.-British plan to vigorously establish U.S. hegemony in the world.

　　II. The North Atlantic Treaty and the U.S.-British Plan to Dominate the World

If the establishment of the Western European Union conforms to the purposes of the U.S.-British bloc in Europe, then it is now clear that this alliance is only one plan, and not a major plan, in the U.S.-British plan to establish world domination. Although the U.S. ruling group allows the United Kingdom to occupy the leading position in the Western European Union, at the same time, it retains all possibilities to control the policies of the entire Western European group according to its own wishes. Nor should it be forgotten that the treaty signed by the United States and South American countries in Rio de Janeiro has already come into effect at the end of last year, which guarantees the influence of the U.S. ruling group over the vast majority of these countries. The realization of the Western European Union and the entry into force of the Pan-American Convention are considered by the U.S. Department of State as important prerequisites for promoting U.S. policy throughout the world. The proposal of the North Atlantic Treaty is the main tool of this policy. Although the North Atlantic Treaty stipulates that five European countries, Canada, and the United States participate in the treaty as allies, it is clear to everyone that the leadership of this matter belongs to the U.S. ruling group, who are now united with the ruling group of the most powerful capitalist country in Europe - the United Kingdom. Since this is the case, the North Atlantic Treaty actually becomes the main tool of the U.S.-British ruling group's aggressive policy on "both sides of the Atlantic," that is, in the eastern and western hemispheres. People should remember that this is precisely the main task of the U.S.-British post-war that Churchill announced in his sensational speech. And this speech of his was delivered at that unusual gathering in Fulton, chaired by Truman.

In addition to the United States, Canada, and the five Western European countries - even Luxembourg is counted as a "North Atlantic" country - the draft North Atlantic Treaty also stipulates the absorption of certain other countries. There is no shortage of talk about this aspect now. Some people talk about inviting certain countries such as Sweden, Norway, and Denmark to participate in this treaty, and point out that the Norwegian government's performance in this regard is extraordinarily active. They also declare that the possibility of Franco's Spain, Portugal, Italy, and even Turkey participating in the North Atlantic Treaty is also under discussion, and they obviously believe that this method will help solve the tasks of the so-called "North Atlantic" leadership group. At the same time, the establishment of a Mediterranean alliance or an Eastern Mediterranean Convention, as an auxiliary tool of the "North Atlantic" group, is also under discussion. The plan to establish one national group after another under the patronage of the U.S.-British, increasingly emphasizes that: The purposes of the main imperialist groups that are now being hurriedly pulled together on the basis of the "North Atlantic Treaty" are by no means regional in nature, but embody the demands of certain countries to dominate every part of the earth. This has also been proven by the planned establishment of a Southeast Asian country group. The concrete implementation of this plan began at the recent meeting in Delhi, which was convened under the name of discussing the Indonesian issue. But it goes without saying that the servile attitude of certain leading figures in these countries is not to make the Asian people agree to embark on a slippery road, the road that those countries obsessed with colonial affairs and their wealthy bosses are stubbornly driving them to take.

All of these show that in the establishment of the North Atlantic Alliance, the U.S.-British ruling group is striving to drag as many countries as possible into this alliance by direct or other means, so as to control them one by one in their hands. Holding this purpose, the British and American ruling groups use all kinds of permissible and impermissible methods. They scare other countries with the monster of a "potential aggressor," while they use crude means of oppression against the governments of small countries. But the situation is very clear. Just as they did when they established the Western Alliance, the instigators of the North Atlantic Treaty, from the beginning, prevented all People's Democratic countries and the Soviet Union from participating in the treaty, and this treaty is directed against the Soviet Union and the People's Democratic countries. It can be seen that the purpose of the North Atlantic Treaty is to enable the U.S.-British ruling group to gain the status of manipulators in as many countries as possible, deprive these countries of the possibility of adopting independent domestic and foreign policies, and use these countries as auxiliary weapons to implement their aggressive plan to establish U.S.-British domination of the world. It is completely obvious that neither the Western European Union nor the Pan-American state group are as closely linked to the goals of the Mediterranean state convention, the Scandinavian state convention, and the Southeast Asian state convention as are currently being promoted by the North Atlantic Treaty. The goal of the North Atlantic Treaty has become the guiding principle of the U.S.-British plan to establish dominion in Western Europe, the North Atlantic, South America, the Mediterranean, Asia, Africa, and every reachable corner of the world.

However, one cannot forget that not all countries that agree to participate in these groups or have already participated in these groups will unconditionally submit to U.S.-British orders in any case. Not only that, but among the peoples of the Eastern countries, there has recently been a surge of national liberation, and they have only today gained the opportunity to stand up straight. Can people turn a blind eye to such an important fact? Finally, we must talk about the Soviet Union and the People's Democratic countries, which are realizing the true will of their own people and the great principle of treating other nations with friendship and equality. The existence of the Soviet Union, with its growing national strength, international prestige, and strong support from democratic forces in other countries, is precisely an insurmountable obstacle in any country's various plans to establish world domination. This was historically proven by the extinguishing of the fascist countries, which once tried to realize their wild plans to dominate the world, and the current U.S.-British plans to dominate the world are little different from those fascist countries.

Immediately after the end of World War II, the U.S. ruling group began establishing air and naval bases in the Atlantic, Pacific, and many remote corners of the world thousands of kilometers away from the United States. Since then, the number of U.S. military bases has not only not decreased, but has greatly increased in countries in the Eastern and Western Hemispheres, in Europe, America, Asia, and Africa. All countries, especially those close to the Soviet border, have been arranged to provide the U.S.-British air force with convenient bridgehead fortresses and other conditions conducive to attacking the Soviet Union. The United States has transported various kinds of weapons to these countries through repeated loans. No rational person can say that this practice is for the defense of the United States. On the other hand, everyone knows that after World War II, which ended in the defeat of the aggressor countries, there was no danger of aggression against the United States. On the contrary, after the end of World War II, the United States and the United Kingdom retained the organization of their joint staff headquarters in Washington (the department secretly organizes its work) to carry out new aggression plans. Could this be considered accidental? Because, if there were no such aggression plan, there would be no reason to retain the staff headquarters in Washington in the current peacetime situation, nor would there be a need to send American and British troops to the territories of more and more countries. Now, U.S. troops are not only stationed in various countries in Europe and Asia by means of carrying out their occupation work in the territory of former enemy countries, but they are also stationed in the territories of many member states of the United Nations. It is very clear that this foreign policy has nothing in common with legitimate concerns for U.S. defense, and this policy is full of brutal and aggressive spirit. Some people in the United States are trying to prepare both West Germany and Japan as weapons of aggression plans and make them accomplices in the aggression that is being prepared. It is no accident that the United States is using any excuse to delay the conclusion of peace treaties with Germany and Japan. This is a natural result of the foreign policy of the U.S. ruling group.

All of the above facts about the post-war foreign policy of the United States and the United Kingdom prove that the ruling groups of these countries are currently not pursuing a policy of establishing lasting and universal peace. On the contrary, they are engaged in an aggressive policy, a policy of launching new wars, and a plan to establish U.S.-British domination of the world by force. The North Atlantic Treaty, which is in line with the purpose of launching new wars, is planned as a means to achieve these purposes. However, people should remember that signing these or any similar covenants is not equivalent to guaranteeing and providing opportunities to achieve the aggressive purposes arranged by the advocates of such covenants. People should recall how unanimous support all the democratic people of all countries gave to the famous statement by the leader of the Soviet government, Stalin; the gist of the statement is: "The tragic scenes of the last war are still fresh in the minds of the people of all countries. The power of the masses of people who advocate peace is so strong for the disciples of Churchill who carry out aggression that they cannot overcome this power and cannot turn this power into a new war."

　　III. The North Atlantic Alliance – A Factor Undermining the United Nations Organization

The official statement of the U.S. Department of State attempts to find a basis for establishing the North Atlantic Alliance and the aforementioned other groups in the name of striving to "strengthen the United Nations organization." However, this conjecture is certainly completely absurd. In fact, the imminent establishment of the North Atlantic Alliance, as the head of a whole set of specific national groups in various regions of the world, proves that the current policies of the United States and the United Kingdom have completely deviated from the policy that the governments of the United States, the United Kingdom, and the Soviet Union, along with many other countries, jointly adhered to when they founded the United Nations and drafted and passed its Charter. As everyone knows, the United Nations has not discussed the establishment of the North Atlantic Alliance or the Western Alliance, nor has it discussed the Pan-American Convention. Everyone knows that the establishment of a Mediterranean alliance, or a Scandinavian group, or a Southeast Asian alliance of states and other alliances of states which are being organized is currently being discussed without the participation of the United Nations and bypassing the United Nations outright. The participants in these groups, primarily the ruling groups of the United States and the United Kingdom, believe that it is of no benefit to them to submit these issues to the United Nations for discussion. In the United Nations, they may be asked about the true purposes and nature of these groups. This is what the relevant governments that lead the establishment of all these alliance groups and organizations absolutely do not want. Therefore, they would rather act secretly behind the backs of the United Nations. In fact, the U.S. and British ruling groups have confronted the United Nations with a fait accompli by establishing these groups and organizations. The North Atlantic Alliance and the state groups connected to it, led by the U.S. and British ruling groups, are directly undermining the United Nations. Today, the purpose of these organizations is to undermine the authority of the United Nations, and tomorrow, they may destroy the United Nations organization. The foundations of the United Nations organization have been systematically undermined in the past three years, and this is not without reason, which is particularly reflected in the attempt to eliminate the principle of unanimity among the five powers in resolving all major issues that guarantee universal peace and international security, and this principle is enshrined in the United Nations Charter.

In order to support its position on the issue of the North Atlantic Alliance, the U.S. Department of State cited the United Nations Charter. But these far from convincing citations are characterized by particular irresponsibility. The U.S. Department of State cited Article 52 of the United Nations Charter, which stipulates that regional conventions may exist if they are consistent with the purposes and principles of the United Nations Charter. Needless to say, this article is necessary for the United Nations Charter. However, the fact is that the North Atlantic Treaty cannot be considered such a regional agreement no matter what. The political significance of the North Atlantic Treaty and the agreements associated with the North Atlantic Treaty have nothing in common with the purposes and principles of regional agreements stipulated in Article 52 of the United Nations Charter. The North Atlantic Treaty cannot be generally described as a regional agreement, because it includes countries in the eastern and western hemispheres, and the purpose it pursues is not to solve various regional issues, but is determined by the general line of U.S.-British foreign policy. This policy is constantly interfering in the affairs of many other countries, and even interfering in every corner of the earth. It is only an irony to say that the North Atlantic Treaty is a regional agreement. Anyone who respects Article 52 of the United Nations Charter would not hold this view. The North Atlantic Alliance is not organized in accordance with Article 52; it is in direct violation of the United Nations Charter and its basic principles.

The U.S. Department of State also mentioned Article 51 of the United Nations Charter, which stipulates that when any member state of the United Nations is subjected to armed attack, member states have the right to exercise individual or collective self-defense before the Security Council takes the necessary measures to maintain international peace and security. It is obvious that the United Nations Charter needs to stipulate such an article. However, it is also obvious that the composition of the North Atlantic Group cannot be based on Article 51. This is primarily evident from the fact that neither the United States, the United Kingdom, nor any other Atlantic country is threatened by any armed attack at all. This alone is sufficient to prove that there is no basis for citing Article 51 of the United Nations Charter in order to justify the establishment of the North Atlantic Alliance. The North Atlantic Treaty is by no means necessary for self-defense, but is something necessary to implement aggressive policies and launch new wars.

If the Department of State's citation of the United Nations Charter is a case of forcing one's views onto something, then it is also necessary to recognize other motivations in the above statement regarding the establishment of the North Atlantic Alliance. In this regard, the U.S. Department of State's citation of the so-called Vandenberg Resolution passed by the U.S. Senate is particularly noteworthy. Last summer (June 11 - editor), the U.S. Senate passed Vandenberg's proposal on a "new plan" for U.S. foreign policy. The U.S. Department of State stated that the above "proposal recommends for the first time in American history that the United States conclude collective security agreements with countries outside the Western Hemisphere in peacetime in order to safeguard peace and strengthen our security." This statement by the U.S. Department of State once again refutes its own assertion that the North Atlantic Alliance is regional in nature. The statement also indicates a change in the foreign policy pursued by the U.S. ruling group after the end of World War II. This change exposes the nakedly aggressive nature of this policy. The above resolution allows the U.S. government to do whatever it wants in establishing any international alliance in peacetime. Under the pretext of ensuring security, the U.S. ruling group can participate in any group and engage in any adventure. The U.S. Senate's passage of this resolution shows that the U.S. ruling group has not only abandoned all its major obligations to the United Nations organization, but has also adopted a new policy direction in foreign policy. Subsequently, the purpose of U.S. foreign policy will be to establish U.S.-British domination of the world by force.

Due to this new direction in the foreign policy of the United States and the United Kingdom, it is not surprising that the spearhead of this policy is directly directed at the Soviet Union and the People's Democratic countries. Because the Soviet Union and the People's Democratic countries are consistently safeguarding the cause of peace throughout the world, and are also fighting tirelessly with new war provocateurs. Therefore, we cannot expect those foreign ruling groups who provoke new wars and are currently doing everything possible to prepare for new wars to treat our country in a friendly manner. The Soviet Union is one of the parties to the various important agreements signed with the United States and the United Kingdom on the common policy toward Western Germany and Eastern Japan - which should serve as a good foundation for establishing lasting world peace on democratic principles. However, due to the fact that the U.S.-British bloc is now implementing a new direction in foreign policy and is unwilling to respect the various agreements they have signed, these agreements are often abandoned by the U.S.-British ruling group. The Soviet Union is also one of the parties to the twenty-year treaty of friendship and mutual assistance with the United Kingdom and France, which is completely in line with the interests of universal and lasting peace, and is particularly important for the consolidation of peace in Europe. However, the ruling groups of the United Kingdom and France violated these treaties and ignored the various obligations that the United Kingdom and France assumed in the treaty to support and consolidate peace in Europe together with the Soviet Union.

Based on the necessity of coordinated action by all five major powers, the Soviet Union has demanded and continues to demand strict compliance with the provisions of the United Nations Charter, because only this kind of action can truly guarantee universal peace and international security. However, the ruling groups of the United States and the United Kingdom have intensified their attacks on the Soviet Union and launched increasingly extensive actions aimed at undermining the United Nations. However, all of this has proven to be unsuccessful. Because the Soviet Union and several other countries did not agree to amend the United Nations Charter. Therefore, after being convinced of this, the ruling groups of the United States and the United Kingdom have apparently reached the conclusion that they must bypass the United Nations. The U.S. and British ruling groups are blinded by the aggressive plan to dominate the world. They fail to understand that this "new plan" of theirs, which violates the obligations they have recently assumed to the Soviet Union and other member states of the United Nations, is far from enhancing their political and economic status. Moreover, it will be condemned by all peace-loving countries and all supporters of consolidated and universal peace who constitute the vast majority of all countries.

The main conclusions are:

First, the U.S. ruling group has adopted a policy of blatant aggression. The ultimate goal of this policy is to establish U.S.-British domination of the world by force. This policy is completely in line with the aggressive policies they pursue and the policies of launching new wars. In view of the above situation, the Soviet Union must carry out a more vigorous and resolute struggle against all war-mongers, against the policies of aggression and launching new wars, and strive for democracy and lasting peace throughout the world. In this struggle to strengthen universal peace and international security, the Soviet Union will regard all other peace-loving countries, and all supporters of democracy and universal peace, as its allies, because they represent the true sentiments and aspirations of the peoples of all nations who bore the brunt in the First World War and are now rejecting all aggressors and provocateurs of new wars with various arguments.

Second, everyone sees that the United Nations is now being undermined, because the United Nations, at least to some extent, hinders and restrains the aggressive and new war-launching policies of the aggressive groups. Regarding the above situation, the Soviet Union must fight more firmly and more resolutely against the destruction and destruction of the United Nations by aggressors and their accomplices, and must be responsible for preventing the United Nations from condoning those elements that are currently often condoned, and for making the authority of the United Nations more respected. Therefore, the problem lies in attacking those who pursue policies of aggression and launching new wars. (End of full text)

### 苏联外交部发表关于“北大西洋公约”的声明

　　苏联外交部发表关于“北大西洋公约”的声明
    【新华社陕北三日电】塔斯社莫斯社一月二十八日讯：苏联外交部顷发表关于北大西洋公约的声明，原文节要如下：
    一月十四日，美国国务院在“建立和平与北大西洋地区的集体安全”这一直言不讳的题目下，发表了冗长的声明。该官方文件表明了美国对所谓“北大西洋公约”所持态度的梗概。美国政府自从去夏以来，一直在会同加拿大并与英、法、比、荷、卢五国政府进行关于该公约的谈判。一九四八年，上述五个西欧国家的统治集团，曾以集体防御为借口，在美国的庇护下，成立了军事与政治联盟。而今年，建立“北大西洋联盟”的长远的美英计划，正在上述欧洲各国及加拿大的参加和美国的直接领导下付诸实行。
　　一、西欧联盟——美英侵略集团在欧洲的武器
    一九四八年三月，英、法、比、荷、卢五国在布鲁塞尔签订了互助与集体防御条约，该条约奠定了某些西欧国家之分裂集团，即所谓“西欧联盟”的基础，条约规定：欧洲其他国家如愿调整它们的政策，使之适合于上述以英国为首的集团的目的，就可以被纳入这一联盟。
    大家知道：西欧联盟的创建者，一开始就杜塞了一切人民民主国家及苏联参加该联盟的可能性，这就暴露了西欧联盟的组成，不是为了团结欧洲各爱好和平国家，也不符合于保证整个欧洲和平的利益，而是有着别的目的，这些目的和对于加强和平与国际安全的关心毫无相同之处。
    不难看出：西欧联盟的成立，首先表明英法两国对德国问题所持政策的全部改变，而且证明这些国家的政府放弃了反希特勒同盟各国在雅尔塔及波茨顿会议上所采取的对德国的民主与反侵略政策，并已采取了新的对爱好和平国家异常有害的政策，旨在建立对欧洲其他国家的统治。为了这种目的，还不犹豫地利用昨天的侵略者，这个侵略者自从战争结束之后，已经变成了它们的附庸。没有什么别的东西能够解释为什么英法政府现在和美国政府一起竭力利用西德，虽然布鲁塞尔条约顺便提到了愿望阻止德国侵略政策的复活。
    西方五国军事联盟之成立，与其说是为了对付德国，无宁说是为了利用他们业已组成的西方国家集团反对它们在二次大战中的盟国。而且，现在已足够明显，他们以防止会危害该约签字国的所谓“经济稳定”的形势为借口，正准备采用军事措施及各种镇压办法，以对付国内的工人阶级与增长中的民主力量和殖民地及附属国家中的民族解放运动。布鲁塞尔条约之为殖民国家的联盟，并非偶然，这些国家为了保持它们在殖民地内上百年来的特权，想运用现在所发动的军事政治组合，镇压这些殖民地的民族解放运动。所有这一切，特别有力地表明了西欧联盟的反民主和侵略的反动性质。
    美英集团的这种政治计划，与对于和平、对于在欧洲国家实现民主原则的关心，其互相抵触是十分明显的。当去年三月西欧联盟刚一出世时，美国统治集团就即刻宣称将予这一联盟以各种支持。现在，大家都清楚，西欧联盟国家在反对人民民主国家及苏联的道路上走得愈快，走得愈远，西欧国家在政治上与经济上就愈益依附于美国统治集团，后者是丝毫也不关心欧洲国家的政治独立和经济复兴的。其结果，将是美国和西欧集团各国之间以及西欧集团本身内部矛盾的加剧。西欧集团所依据的不是健全的也不是巩固的经济复兴的基础，这一集团在某种意义上是辅助性质的，这只要看到“马歇尔化”国家所建立的更为广泛的欧洲国家联合就可以知道。这一欧洲国家的联合不但不能予参加国以任何切实的帮助，并且一点也没有能防止许多西欧国家的日益增加的经济困难。西欧集团的侵略目的，还反映在不断增添的要更多军队、更多军费的要求上，这愈来愈破坏了它们在经济上稳定前进的希望。同时，这种形势使得这些国家内部的严重政治困难更加紧张起来。
    西方联盟到现在为止，已用了颇为不少的办法塑成它的机构形式。早在去年春天，随着咨询委员会的成立，就在伦敦设立了该联盟的常设机构，由五国代表组成。他们还设立了军事委员会，以至西欧联盟总部，由五国参谋总长组成，而以英国蒙哥马利元帅为首。在目前和平情况下，这样匆忙的完成这些组织工作，包括设立总部在内，决不是证明西欧集团之参加者有任何保证欧洲持久和平的愿望。完成所有这些工作时的大惊小怪的样子，倒是证明他们所怀的目的是对某些欧洲国家，包括德国西部在内施以政治压力，并借环绕这一切工作的这种宣传叫嚣，促进这些国家参加西方集团，同时，还在欧洲国家公众人士间制造惶恐不安之感与战争狂。这是美英集团目前在欧洲推行其侵略政策的主要策略之一。除了在欧洲建立西欧联盟之外，美英统治集团过去两个月来，还从事于建立由这同样五个国家和加拿大、美国组成的北大西洋联盟。北大西洋联盟的目的，较之西欧联盟要远大得多。显而易见，这个目的是与美英强力地建立由美国称王的世界霸权的计划，很紧密地交织在一起的。
  　二、北大西洋公约与美英统治世界的计划
    如要说，西欧联盟的建立，符合于美英集团在欧洲的目的，那么，现在已经可以明显的看出：这一联盟只是美英建立世界统治计划中的一个计划，而且不是一个主要的计划。美国统治集团虽然让英国在西欧联盟中占据为首的地位，但在同时，它却保有按自己意愿以左右整个西欧集团的政策的一切可能。也不应忘记：美国和南美国家在里约热内卢所签订的条约，已在去年年底生效，该条约保证美国统治集团对其中绝大多数国家的影响。西欧联盟的实现以及泛美公约的生效，被美国国务院认为是在全世界推行美国政策的重要前提。北大西洋公约之提出，则作为这一政策的主要工具。虽然北大西洋公约规定欧洲五个国家、加拿大和美国参加该约作为盟员，然而谁都清楚：这一事情的领导属于美国统治集团，他们现在与欧洲最强大的资本主义国家——英国的统治集团结成一体。既然如此，北大西洋公约实际上就成为“大西洋两岸”，也即东西两半球上的美英统治集团侵略政策的主要工具。人们当记得，这正是邱吉尔在其耸人听闻的演说中所宣布的美英战后的主要任务。而他的这一演说就是在福尔顿那次由杜鲁门任主席的不平常集会上所发表的。
    除了美、加和西欧五国——连卢森堡也算作“北大西洋”国家在内——以外，北大西洋公约草案还规定吸收某些其他国家。关于这一方面的谈论，现在不在少数，有人谈到邀请某些国家如瑞典、挪威和丹麦参加这一公约，并指出挪威政府在这方面的表现是异乎寻常的活跃。他们又宣称，佛朗哥西班牙、葡萄牙、意大利，甚至土耳其参加北大西洋公约的可能性，也正在讨论中，他们并且显然认为这一方法将有助于解决所谓“北大西洋”领导集团的任务。与此同时，作为“北大西洋”集团的辅助工具的地中海联盟或东地中海公约的成立，也在讨论中。在美英卵翼之下建立一个又一个国家集团的计划，越发着重说明了：现在正以“北大西洋公约”为基础急忙拉在一起的主要帝国主义集团的目的，绝不是区域性质的，而是体现了某些国家统治地球上一切部分的要求。这同样已由计划成立东南亚国家集团的计划所证明。该计划的具体实施开始于最近在德里召开的会议，这一会议是在讨论印尼问题的名义下召开的。但是，用不着说，这些国家内某些领袖人物的奴颜卑膝的态度，不是以使亚洲人民同意走上泞滑的道路，这条道路是那些醉心于殖民事务的国家及他们富有的老板们所正固执地驱使他们走上去的。
    所有这些都表明在成立北大西洋联盟中，美英统治集团努力用直接的或其他的办法，将尽可能更多的国家拖入这种联盟，这样，将它们一个个地控制在手里。英美统治集团抱着这一目的，他们使用各种可以容许的和不可容许的方法。他们以“潜在的侵略者”的怪物恐吓其他国家，同时他们又对小国政府使用粗野的压迫手段。但是，局势是十分明显的。恰如他们在成立西方联盟时所做的一样，北大西洋公约的策动者，从开始就防止一切人民民主国家及苏联参加该公约的可能性，而且，这个公约正是针对苏联与人民民主国家的。可以看出，北大西洋公约的目的就是：美英统治集团在尽可能多的国家中获得操纵者的地位，剥夺这些国家采取独立的内政外交政策的可能性，利用这些国家作为实施他们建立美英对世界统治的侵略计划的辅助武器。完全显而易见地，不论是西欧联盟或泛美国家集团，都与目前所策动的地中海国家公约、斯堪的纳维亚国家公约及东南亚国家公约一样，是与北大西洋公约的目标密切结合着的。北大西洋公约的目标，业已成为美英在西欧、北大西洋、南美、地中海、亚洲、非洲以及在世界每一个能够达到的角落建立统治的计划的指导方针。
    然而，人们不可以忘记，并不是一切同意参加这些集团的国家或已经参加这些集团的国家，都会无条件地在任何情形之下向美英的命令屈服的。不仅如此，在东方国家的人民中，最近已经掀起汹涌的民族解放的高潮，他们只有在今天才算获得了挺直腰杆站立起来的机会。难道人们对于这样重要的事实还能熟视无睹吗？最后，我们必须谈到苏联和各人民民主国家，它们正在实现着自己人民的真正意志和以友谊与平等对待其他民族的伟大原则。国力日益强大又有着国际威信和得到其他国家民主力量有力支持的苏联的存在，正是任何国家在其建立世界统治的所有各种计划中不能通过的障碍。这一点，从扑灭法西斯各国上面得到了具有历史意义的证明，那些法西斯国家曾经力图实现它们统治世界的狂妄计划，而现在的美英统治世界的计划，和那些法西斯国家的计划是相差无几的。
    美国统治集团在第二次世界大战结束后立即开始在大西洋、太平洋以及许多距美国好几千公里远的天涯海角建立空军基地和海军基地。从那时起，美国的军事基地，不但没有减少，反而在东半球和西半球、在欧洲、美洲、亚洲和非洲的国家里大大地增加了。一切国家，特别是那些紧靠苏联边疆的国家，都已被安排了提供美英空军以便利的桥头堡垒以及其他便利于进攻苏联的条件。美国通过一次又一次贷款的方法，把各式各样的武器源源运交这些国家。没有一个有理性的人，能够说这种作法是为了美国的国防。另一方面，人人都知道在以侵略国家的失败而结束的第二次大战之后，并没有侵略美国的危险存在。相反，在第二次大战结束之后，美英却保留了它们在华盛顿的联合参谋总部的组织（该部以秘密方式组织它的工作），进行新的侵略计划，这难道能认为是偶然的吗？因为，假如没有这种侵略计划，便没有原由在目前和平时期的情况下保留华盛顿的参谋总部，也无需派遣美国以及英国的军队到越来越多的国家的领土上去。现在，美军不仅是用执行其在前敌国领土上占领工作的方法驻留在欧亚各国，并且他们还驻留在联合国许多会员国的领土上面。十分明白，这种外交政策与对美国国防的正当关心没有丝毫共同的地方，并且这一政策是充满着残暴，侵略精神的。美国某些人士正在力求将西德和日本都准备成为侵略计划的武器，并使它们成为正在准备中的侵略的共谋犯。美国之所以正凭借任何借口以延缓对德对日和约的缔结，这不是偶然的，这是美国统治集团外交政策的自然结果。
    上述一切有关美英两国战后外交政策的事实，证明了这些国家的统治集团，目前不但不奉行建立持久与普遍和平的政策，相反地，却在从事于一种侵略政策，发动新战争的政策，以及用暴力建立美英对世界之统治的计划。与发动新战争这一政策的目的相一致的北大西洋公约，正是被计划作为达到这些目的的手段。但是，人们应该记着：签订这些或任何类似的公约，并不等于保证和提供机会来实现这类公约之倡导者所安排的侵略目的，人们应该就此追忆一下所有一切国家的民主人士曾对苏联政府领袖斯大林著名声明给以怎样一致的支持；该声明的大意就是：“上次战争的惨象，各国人民的记忆犹新。主张和平的人民大众的力量，对进行侵略的邱吉尔门徒们来说，是如此的强大，他们战胜不了这种力量，不能将这种力量转向新的战争去。”
  　三、北大西洋联盟——破坏联合国组织的因素
    美国国务院的正式声明，企图以努力“加强联合国组织”为名而为建立北大西洋联盟以及上述其他集团找到根据。但是，这种臆断当然是完全荒谬的。实际上，作为世界各地区一整套特定国家集团之首的北大西洋联盟，它的行将仓促成立，证明了美英两国当前的政策，业已完全脱离了美、英、苏三国政府与其他许多国家共同在成立联合国，和草订与通过其宪章时所致遵行的那一政策。众所周知，联合国并未讨论过成立北大西洋联盟或西方联盟，也未讨论过泛美公约，大家都知道：成立地中海联盟，或斯堪的纳维亚集团、或东南亚各国联盟及其他正在组织当中的国家联盟这一问题，目前正在没有联合国参加和直截了当地绕过联合国的情形下进行讨论中。这些集团的参加者，首先是美英两国的统治集团，认为把这些问题提交联合国讨论，对他们是毫无益处的。在联合国中，他们将可能被询问这些集团的真正目的与性质。这是那些领导成立这一切联盟集团及组织的各有关政府所绝不愿意的。因此，它们宁愿背着联合国秘密地行事。实际上，美英两国统治集团都以成立这些集团与组织而使联合国面对既成事实。北大西洋联盟及与之相连的以美英两国统治集团为首的国家集团，已在直接破坏着联合国。今天，这些组织的目的，在于破坏联合国的威权，而明天，它们或许就要摧毁联合国组织了。联合国组织的基础，在最近三年来一直受到有系统的破坏，这并不是无因的，这特别反映在力图取消五强在解决一切保证普遍和平与国际安全的重大问题的一致原则上，而这一原则是由联合国宪章所载明了的。
    美国国务院为了支持其对北大西洋联盟问题上所持的立场，援引了联合国宪章。但这些远不能使人信服的引证，是以特别不负责任为其特点的。美国国务院援引联合国宪章第五十二条，该条规定区域公约如与联合国宪章之宗旨及原则相一致时可以存在。不用说，这一条是联合国宪章所必需的。但是，事实是，北大西洋公约，无论怎样也不能被认为是这种区域性的协定。北大西洋公约以及与北大西洋公约相关联的协定，其政治意义与联合国宪章第五十二条所规定的区域性协定的目的和原则毫无相同之处。北大西洋约公不能一般地说成是区域性协定，因为它包括东西两半球的国家在内，而且它所追求的目的，并不是解决各种不同的区域性问题，而是决定于美英外交政策的总路线。这一政策是不断干涉其他许多国家的事情，甚至干涉到地球上每一个角落的事情。说北大西洋公约是区域性协定，只是一种讽刺。凡是尊重联合国宪章第五十二条的人，都不会持这种见解。北大西洋联盟并不是根据第五十二条组织的，它是直接违反联合国宪章及其基本原则的。
    美国国务院同样还提到联合国宪章第五十一条，该条规定联合国任何会员国受到武力攻击时，在安全理事会采取必要办法，以维持国际和平及安全以前，会员国有行使单独或集体自卫的权利。联合国宪章之需要规定这样一条是很明显的。但是，北大西洋集团的组成决不能从第五十一条中找到根据，这也同样是显而易见的。这首先从这样一个事实就显然可知，即不论是美国、英国或者是其他任何大西洋国家，都根本未受到任何武装进攻的威胁，仅仅这一点就足以证明为了辩解北大西洋联盟的成立而引证联合国宪章第五十一条是没有任何根据的。北大西洋公约决不是自卫所需，而是实现侵略政策与发动新战争政策所需的东西。
    如果国务院关于联合国宪章的引证是牛头不对马嘴的，那么，再对上述声明中的其他关于成立北大西洋联盟的动机予以认识，也是有必要的。在这一方面，美国国务院之引述美国参院通过的所谓范登堡决议案是值得特别注意的。去年夏天（六月十一日——编者），美国参院通过了范登堡提出的关于美国外交政策“新方案”的提案。美国国务院声明称，上述“提案建议美国历史上第一次的在和平时期同西半球以外的国家缔结集体安全协定，以保障和平及加强我们的安全”。美国国务院的这一声明，再次驳倒了它自己硬说北大西洋联盟实属区域性质的断言。该声明同时也表明第二次世界大战结束后美国统治集团所奉行的外交政策的变化，这种变化暴露了这一政策的赤裸裸的侵略性质。上述决议案使美国政府于和平时期在建立任何国际性联盟上的为所欲为，可以在确保安全的借口下使美国统治集团参加任何集团及从事于任何冒险。美国参院之通过这一决议案，表明美国统治集团不仅抛弃了他们对联合国组织所承担的一切主要义务，而且也在外交政策上采取了新的方针，其后，美国的外交政策将以用武力建立美英对世界的统治为目的。
    由于美英两国外交政策的这一新方向，因此，这一政策的矛头之直接指向苏联及人民民主国家，那是不足为奇的。因为苏联及各人民民主国家，正在始终一致地保障全世界范围的和平事业，而且也正在和一个新战争挑拨者进行不倦的斗争。因此，我们不能指望那些挑拨新战争并在目前竭尽一切努力以准备新战争的外国统治集团方面对我国持友好的态度。苏联是在对西方德国及东方日本的共同政策——该政策应作为在民主原则上建立世界持久和平的良好基础——上与美英两国签订各个重要协定的一方。但是，由于美英集团现在在外交政策上执行新的方针，不愿尊重他们所签订的各项协定，因此，这些协定就常常为美英统治集团所背弃。苏联也是与英法两国签订二十年友好互助条约的一方，该条约完全符合于普遍与持久和平的利益，而且对于欧洲和平的巩固特别重要。但是，英法两国统治集团违反了这些条约，将英法两国在条约中所承担会同苏联支持及巩固欧洲和平的各种义务置若罔闻。
    苏联根据所有五大国有协调行动的必要，曾要求且现在仍要求严格遵守联合国宪章的条款，因为只有这种行动才能真正保证普遍和平与国际安全。但是，美英两国统治集团却加紧攻击苏联，并发动了愈来愈广泛的旨在破坏联合国的行动。然而，这一切都证明是不能达到目的的。因为苏联及其他若干国家不同意修改联合国宪章。因此，美英两国统治集团在深信这点之后，显然已达到了这样的结论，这就是他们必须绕过联合国。美英两国统治集团被统治世界的侵略计划冲昏了头脑，他们未能了解：他们违背最近对苏联及联合国其他会员国所承担之义务的这一政策的“新方案”，远不能增强他们的政治与经济地位，而且将受到一切爱好和平国家及构成一切国家之绝大多数的巩固与普遍和平的拥护者全体的谴责。
    主要的结论是：
    第一，美国统治集团已采取公然侵略的政治方针，这种方针的最终目的，就是以武力建立美英对全世界的统治，这种方针完全符合于他们所奉行的侵略政策和发动新战争的政策。鉴于上述情势，苏联必须进行更加奋力与更加坚毅的斗争，反对一切战争贩子，反对侵略与发动新战争的政策，争取全世界范围民主与持久的和平。在这一争取普遍和平与国际安全之加强的斗争中，苏联将把所有其他爱好和平的国家，及一切爱好民主及普遍和平的支持者，看作自己的盟友，因为他们所代表的，正是那些在第一次世界大战中曾首当其冲，而现在又以各种论据拒斥一切侵略者和新战争挑拨者的各族人民的真正情绪和愿望。
    第二，每个人都看到，联合国现在正受到破坏，这是因为联合国至少在某种程度上阻挠和遏止着侵略集团的侵略与发动新战争的政策。关于上述情势，苏联必须更加坚定与更加坚毅地为反对侵略分子及其同谋者破坏与摧毁联合国而斗争，必须负责使联合国不纵容那些在目前常被纵容的分子，使联合国的威权受到更高的尊重，因此，问题在于对那些奉行着侵略与发动新战争政策的人们予以打击。（全文完）
