    【Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 7th】 TASS, Tokyo dispatch: Under the initiative of the Japan Congress of Industrial Unions (San-Betsu), representatives of unions belonging to San-Betsu, representatives of some independent unions, and key personnel from the Communist Party and the Labor-Farmer Party held an informal meeting on February 4th. Representatives of the Socialist Party were invited to attend, but they refused. The meeting discussed the issue of establishing a united front to carry out a common struggle. Communist Party representative Nozaka Sanzō stated that the Communist Party has not abandoned hope of establishing a united front of the Communist Party, the Socialist Party, and the Labor-Farmer Party.
    Another dispatch: The Japan Congress of Industrial Unions, the National Railway Workers' Union, and other trade unions demanded on January 31st that Labor Minister Masuda Kanehichi publicly disclose the government's secret plan to revise the labor law. In making this demand, the aforementioned unions condemned the Yoshida government for using the so-called nine-point "economic stabilization plan" to implement mass layoffs, intensify exploitation, reduce wages, and prepare to make revisions to the labor law unfavorable to workers. The unions' statement said: We will not allow fascist methods in deciding such issues. If the government refuses to accept recommendations and begins to revise the labor law with fascist methods, then the unions will hold the government fully responsible for destroying Japan's economic recovery.

　　日共与工农党、产联代表
  　开会筹组联合阵线
    【新华社陕北七日电】塔斯社东京讯：在日本产业劳动组合联合会的倡导之下，属于日本产业劳动组合联合会的各工会代表，某些独立工会的代表，与共产党及工农党的重要人员，于二月四日举行了非正式的会议。社会党代表曾被邀出席，但他们拒绝参加。会议讨论了建立联合战线以进行共同斗争的问题。共产党代表野坂参三称：共产党尚未放弃建立共产党、社会党与工农党的联合阵线的希望。
    另讯：日本产业劳动组合联合会、国营铁道工会及其他职工会，于一月三十一日要求劳工相增田杵七公开政府修改劳工法的秘密计划。在提出这一要求时，上述工会谴责吉田政府利用所谓九点“经济稳定计划”来实行大批解雇、加紧剥削、减低工资及准备对劳工法作不利于工人的修改。各工会的声明称：我们将不容许在决定这种问题上的法西斯办法。如果政府拒绝接受建议，及以法西斯办法开始修改劳工法，则工会将要政府负破坏日本经济复兴的全部责任。
