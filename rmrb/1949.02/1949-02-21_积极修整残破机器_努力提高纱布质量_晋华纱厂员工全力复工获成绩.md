Jinzhong News: The famous Jin Hua Textile Factory in Shanxi (now state-owned), after being sabotaged by the Yan Xishan bandits, has been actively repaired by all 400-plus employees of the factory. The yarn and cloth currently produced are fine and uniform, and significant results have also been achieved in terms of material conservation. The two manual weaving factories of the factory's cotton weaving department produced No. 3 coarse cloth, which was 2.7 feet wide and had only about 1,500 warp threads before liberation. Now, this has been increased to 1,750 to 1,900 warp threads. Similarly, the state-produced cloth, which was 2.4 feet wide, had only 1,200 warp threads before liberation, but has been increased to 1,350 to 1,400 warp threads after liberation. In terms of production quantity, according to a survey by Wang Ailiang's team, it took 2 to 2.5 minutes to wind one foot of fine yarn before liberation; after liberation, due to the organization of mutual aid in yarn winding, it only takes 1 to 1.5 minutes. Zhao Chunding of the textile section experimented with changing the 16-inch "sheng lun" (driving pulley) to a 14-inch "sheng lun," which accelerated the speed, allowing each machine to spin the yarn one more time per shift, producing an additional 24 to 25 pounds. Not only did the output increase, but raw materials were also saved. For example, each braid of yarn is now eight inches shorter than before, and each machine with forty braids can save 320 inches. One person can spin more than 30 machines a day, which can save about 10,000 inches. If all the yarn-spinning workers and machines in the factory are counted, the amount saved is truly astonishing. Regarding the installation of spinning machines, according to Zhao Chunding and Wang Ailiang, who are familiar with general textile industry, it took more than 60 workers to install a spinning machine in a textile factory under Yan Xishan's rule; it also took more than 50 workers in Shanghai in the Kuomintang-controlled area. After liberation, based on the principle of considering both public and private interests, the factory formulated a plan to install a spinning machine with 50 workers. As a result, due to the changed work attitude of the workers, an unprecedented record of installing a spinning machine with more than 20 workers was created from the beginning. Soon, further progress was made, creating a record of installing a spinning machine with 16 to 19 workers. On average, only 18 workers were used to install each spinning machine, saving more than 42 workers compared to factories under Yan Xishan's rule. The manufacturing industry has also expanded. Before liberation, the factory's power department was only responsible for the factory's repairs and did not undertake external work. After liberation, in addition to ensuring the factory's repairs, the workers in the power department also made 20 drilling machines before the New Year, which can drill iron objects 2.5 inches thick and drill holes with a diameter of 1/10th to 3/10ths of an inch. They are now further designing and manufacturing drilling machine blueprints for drilling iron 6/10ths of an inch thick with holes 6/10ths to 1 inch in diameter. A prototype has been made and successfully tested, and preparations are now underway for manufacturing.

Due to the new work attitude established by all employees, in the short six months after liberation, not only have they overcome all difficulties and defeated the serious sabotage by the Yan Xishan bandits, completing the above-mentioned brilliant achievements, but they have also created new 13-inch diameter metal mesh, 28-inch long, 26-inch diameter steam cylinders, and front and rear bearing journals and other important machine parts, repairing the steam engine that had been scrapped for many years into a large 500-horsepower engine.

Due to the factory's planned supply of fine yarn to small weaving factories and support for the development of small weaving factories, the number of looms has expanded by more than 100 in Pingyao alone, and more than 50 in Yuci. The main direction of the factory's future expansion of production is to expand fine yarn production, in order to further complete the plan to support small weaving factories in various liberated areas.

　　积极修整残破机器
  　努力提高纱布质量
    晋华纱厂员工全力复工获成绩
    【晋中讯】山西著名的晋华纺织厂（现为国营），自遭阎匪破坏后，经该厂全体四百余职工的积极努力修复，目前生产的纱、布，又细又匀，材料节约方面，亦收到显著成绩。该厂棉织部的两个人工织布厂，在未解放前所出产的二尺七寸宽的三号粗布，经线只有一千五百根左右，现在已提高到一千七百五十根到一千九百根。又如二尺四寸宽的国布，在解放前经线只有一千二百根，解放后增到一千三百五十根到一千四百根。在生产的数量上，据王爱良所领导的一个班的调查：解放前络一尺细纱，需二分到二分半钟；解放后，由于组织互助络纱，只用一分到一分半钟。纺织科赵春鼎，试验把十六寸的生轮（即皮带盘）改为十四寸的生轮，使速度加快，每一班一部车即能多摇一次纱，多出二十四、五磅。不但产量增加了，原料也节省很多，例如一辫线即比过去节约八寸，一车四十辫，可节约三百二十寸，一天一个人能摇三十多车，就可节约一万寸左右。如果把全厂摇纱工人和车子均统计起来，节约的数目是非常惊人的。在按装纺纱机上，据熟悉一般纺织工业的赵春鼎和王爱良等谈，在阎匪统治下的纺织厂内，按装一台纺纱机需要六十多个工；在国民党统治区的上海也需五十多个工；解放以后，厂方根据公私兼顾的原则，订出五十个工按装一台纺纱机的计划，结果由于工人劳动态度改变，一开始就创造了二十多个工按装一台纺纱机的空前纪录，不久就有进一步地创造了以十六个工到十九个工按装一台纺纱机。平均按装每台纺纱机只用到十八个工，较阎匪统治下的工厂节约到四十二个工以上。在制造业上也已扩大，解放前该厂的原动部，只管该厂的修缮，不作外工。解放后原动部的工人除了保证本厂的修缮以外，还在年前作出二十部钻床，能钻二寸五分厚的铁器，直径钻到一分到三分的眼。现更进一步设计制造钻六分厚的铁直径六七分到一寸眼的钻床图样，且作成一部样子，试用已成功，现正准备制造中。
    由于全体职工树立了新的劳动态度，在解放后短短的半年中，不仅克服了一切困难，战胜了阎匪严重的破坏，完成了以上许多的光辉成绩，而且创制了新的直径十三英寸的五金网，二十八英寸长、二十六英寸直径的汽柄，和前后盘梗等重要机件，把历年破废的蒸汽机，修缮为使用五百马力的大引擎。
    由于该厂有计划供给小织布厂细纱，扶持小织布厂的发展，仅平遥即扩大织布机达一百多架，榆次亦达五十余架。该厂今后扩大生产的主要方向是扩大细纱，以更进一步完成扶植解放区各地小织布厂的计划。
