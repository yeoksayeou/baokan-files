Xinhua News Agency, East China, 26th -- The commanders and soldiers of the People's Liberation Army East China Field Army are economizing on food and clothing to relieve 200,000 disaster victims in the severely ravaged areas of Xiaoxian, Yongcheng, and Suxian by the Kuomintang bandit troops. The Front Committee of the CPC East China Field Army has not only decided that the entire army will save 1 million catties of grain within one month and that each column will contribute 20 head of livestock to be handed over to the local democratic government for relief, but also called on the entire army to donate money and goods to help the disaster victims. This call was immediately met with an enthusiastic response from the commanders and soldiers. A certain regiment donated more than 3.56 million North Sea currency, more than 5,400 Central Plains currency, and a large amount of grain, clothing, shoes, and socks. An artillery regiment donated all of the 1,500 catties of grain they had saved. Many comrades also donated their stipends, health care funds, disability funds, injury compensation, and clothing, shoes, socks, and towels. A newly liberated soldier, Zhang He, donated 10,000 North Sea currency, saying, "I am also a poor person. The suffering of the people here is the same as the suffering of my parents at home."

  　救济灾民
    【新华社华东二十六日电】人民解放军华东野战军指战员节衣缩食，救济受国民党匪军严重摧残的萧县、永城、宿县地区的二十万灾民。中共华东野战军前线党委会除决定全军在一个月内节约粮食一百万斤，每一纵队抽出牲口二十头，送交当地民主政府进行帐济外，并号召全军献金献物，救济灾民。这一号召立即得到指战员们热烈响应。某团共献出北海币三百五十六万多元，中州币五千四百多元，及粮食衣服鞋袜甚多。某部炮兵团将节约的一千五百斤粮食全部捐出。许多同志并将自己的津贴、保健费、残费金、负伤费及被服、鞋袜、毛巾等献了出来。新解放战士张河献了北海币一万元，他说：“我也是穷人，这里老百姓受苦，跟我家里父母受苦一样。”
