Xinhua News Agency, East China, 10th—Postal workers in the East China Liberated Area, with very limited manpower and braving wind, snow, and bitter cold, gloriously completed the task of delivering battlefield mail during the Huaihai Campaign. After the enemy fled Xuzhou, the East China Postal and Telecommunications管理局 (Bureau) dispatched a small number of personnel, along with militiamen, totaling about forty people. They marched urgently for seven or eight days to the triangular area of Xiaoxian, Yongcheng, and Suxian, setting up three directly subordinate stations around the large battlefield where the bandit troops of Du Yuming and Qiu Qingquan were being encircled and annihilated, to carry out battlefield mail delivery work.

One station had only six messengers, who delivered mail separately each day, covering distances of fifty to sixty li. They would depart in the afternoon, deliver the mail by dawn the next day, and return at four in the afternoon, setting off again after eating. This continued for five days and five nights, ultimately completing the task. During periods of frequent mail transport, the station chief, Wang Yanbin, also personally carried newspapers.

Because the troops were mobile and transferred frequently, and the postal routes changed, Kong Qingbin of one station traveled day and night from Suining to the Yunhe Station, Pixian, Lanling, and back to Xuzhou, a round trip of over three hundred li, completing the work of adjusting the postal routes, ensuring that the mail did not take unnecessary detours.

Liu Baoquan, Wang Huiyin, and Wang Bensong from the second station went to a certain unit on an urgent mission, feeling their way through fifty li of muddy road on a snowy and windy night, covered in mud. The mailbags were frozen like glass packages, and the cotton-padded clothes, after being roasted by the fire, would drip with water when lightly squeezed.

To celebrate the great victory of the Huaihai Campaign, the East China Postal and Telecommunications Bureau stipulated that the sending and delivery of letters and gifts to comfort the soldiers at the front and the wounded and sick in various hospitals would be free of charge. The postage for letters from wounded soldiers would also be waived. Postal and telecommunications bureaus in cities and counties such as Jinan and Xuzhou have already begun to implement this policy.

　　在淮海战役中冒着风寒
  　华东工完成战地邮递
    【新华社华东十日电】华东解放区的邮务人员在淮海战役中，以极少人力，冒着风雪严寒，光荣地完成战地邮件的寄递任务。徐州敌人逃窜后，华东邮电管理局派遣少数人员连同民兵共约四十人，经七八天急行军赶到萧县、永城、宿县三角地带，围绕围歼杜聿明、邱清泉匪军的大战场，设立了三个直属站，进行战地投邮工作。一站只有交通员六人，每天分头投送邮件，路程都是五六十里。当日下午出发，第二天拂晓送到，下午四时回来，吃了饭又出发。这样持续五天五夜，最后完成任务。在邮运频繁时该站站长王彦彬亦亲自挑报。因为部队流动转移，邮线变化，一站的孔庆斌日夜兼程，由睢宁到运河站、邳县、兰陵，折到徐州，往返三百余里，完成调整邮线的工作，使邮件没有走弯路。二站的刘保全、王徽银、王本松三人因紧急任务到某部队，在风雪交加的黑夜摸了五十里泥泞路，跌得满身泥水，邮袋冻得象玻璃包，棉衣经火烤后，轻轻一捏水就直淌，为庆祝淮海战役的伟大胜利，华东邮电管理局规定：凡慰劳前方军人和各医院伤病员的信件和慰劳品的寄递一律免费，伤员信件也免费收寄，济南、徐州等市县邮电局并已开始照此办理。
