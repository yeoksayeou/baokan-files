　　Uniting and Transforming Intellectuals in Newly Liberated Areas
  　Xinxiang and Huixian Establish the Northern Henan Cadre School
    [Taihang Telegram] Xinxiang, Huixian and other counties jointly established the Northern Henan Cadre School to unite and transform intellectuals in the newly liberated areas. Based on the policy of uniting, cherishing, and transforming intellectuals, the Xinxiang, Huixian, and Huojia democratic governments jointly established the "Northern Henan Cadre School" in early December. They gathered current primary and secondary school principals, teachers, and intellectuals in the countryside for intensive training. The main content of the study was our Party's various policies, the victorious situation, and New Democratic education. The intellectuals in the newly liberated areas, who had long suffered under the rule and persecution of the Chiang Kai-shek bandits, rushed to sign up. The original plan was to train more than 100 teachers, but the number of applicants exceeded the original plan by more than twofold. Although the school authorities tried their best to accommodate them, the dormitories and study places were still strained. They had to let the older students go home early. After the decision was announced, only three people were reluctantly willing to go back, while the others insisted on continuing their studies. The wife of student Sun Youming gave birth and sent someone to find him, but he said, "Giving birth is certainly important, but the loss of delaying my studies cannot be compensated for." He did not return. Xu Cheng, the principal of Xinxiang Private Jicheng Middle School, and his son both came to study. Many brothers and couples came to study together. After understanding our Party's policies, student Wang Ping said, "I used to work in the reactionary 'government' and I am sorry for the revolution and the people. The Chiang Kai-shek bandit gang shamelessly deceived us by saying that the Communist Party had a 'three all' policy and 'twenty-four tortures,' and would kill intellectuals upon sight. Now I understand who is black and who is white. In the future, I will fight those shameless rumor-mongering reactionaries to the death under the leadership of the Communist Party!" The study period was set for half a month, but many students felt that the time was too short and asked for an extension, requesting work, and requesting to continue their studies at North China University, expressing their willingness to serve the masses and struggle for the construction of a new democratic society under the banner of the Communist Party's truth.

　　团结改造新区知识分子
  　新乡辉县举办豫北干部学校
    【太行电】新乡、辉县等县联合举办豫北干校，团结改造新区知识分子。新乡、辉县、获嘉我民主政府，本着团结爱护及改造知识分子的政策，在十二月初联合举办“豫北干部学校”，集训一部现任中小学校长教员及在乡知识分子，学习内容主要是我党的各种政策、胜利形势与新民主主义的教育。久经蒋匪统治迫害的新区知识分子，争先恐后前往报名，原定受训教员百余名，报名者却超过了原计划的二倍以上。校方虽多方安插，但宿舍和学习场所仍感困难，不得已让年龄较大学员提前回家，决定宣布后，仅有三个人勉强愿意回去，其他仍坚持要继续学习。学员孙有明的妻子分娩，派人来找他，他说：“生孩子固然要紧，但耽误了学习其损失是不可补偿的。”始终没回去。新乡私立冀成中学校长许成之父子两人都来学习。很多兄弟、夫妻同来学习，学员王平在了解了我党政策后说：“从前我在反动‘政府’作过事，对不起革命，对不起人民。蒋家匪帮无耻的欺骗我们说：共产党有‘三光政策’‘廿四刑’见了知识分子就杀，现在我明白了谁黑谁白。以后我要在共产党领导下，和那些无耻造谣的反动分子拼命！”学习时期规定为半个月，有很多学员感到时间太短，纷纷要求续期，请求工作，请求到华北大学继续学习，表示愿在共产党的真理旗帜下为群众服务，为新民主主义社会的建设事业而奋斗。
