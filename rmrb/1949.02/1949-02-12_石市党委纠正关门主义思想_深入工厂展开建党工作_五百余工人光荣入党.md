　　Shijiazhuang Municipal Party Committee Corrects Closed-Doorism, Deepens Party Building in Factories
　　Over 500 Workers Join the Party Gloriously
　　[This newspaper dispatch] Since the start of the war preparedness, resumption of work, and production increase campaign to make up for losses last October, the Party organizations in Shijiazhuang's public factories have added 533 new party members (before September, only 20-odd members were developed), accounting for 5% of the more than 10,000 workers in public enterprises. These new party members are all models and activists in the war preparedness, resumption of work, and production competitions. In three months (October, November, and December), the Fanrong Factory developed 130 party members, the Qianjin Factory developed 108, the Northern Printing Factory developed 60, the Electric Light Company developed 57, the Yumin Industrial Company developed 56, and the Guangming Factory, Winery, Fuyuan Chemical, and other factories developed more than 40. From the day they filled out the application form, these new party members have been even more active in their work.

　　Why was the development of Party work sluggish after liberation until September? There are several problems: First, closed-doorism in developing the Party. Our cadres were all transferred from the countryside to the city, and they did not pay enough attention to the work of the workers; secondly, the Municipal Party Committee did not deploy the Party building work until July; another reason is that the party members from the old liberated areas thought that Shijiazhuang had been ruled by Japanese invaders and Chiang Kai-shek's puppets several times, and the social situation was complicated, so they had to be vigilant. This understanding is generally correct; however, they emphasized it too much, so that when some highly conscious workers took the initiative to approach the Party, some people said that these people were opportunists, and completely ignored recognizing them as their own class brothers from the perspective of class essence.

　　In September, the Municipal Party Committee clearly pointed out the task of developing the Party, reviewed this erroneous thinking, and proposed to closely link the Party with the masses, understand the lives of the workers, and become one with the workers in life. It was proposed that party members should make at least three to five worker friends, and the thinking of party members changed. In particular, after the war preparedness, resumption of work, and production increase campaign to make up for losses, the workers exerted unprecedented initiative and creativity, and selflessly sacrificed, which made the party members see this great action of the workers with their own eyes, and the erroneous thinking gradually disappeared. During the war preparedness, under the bombing of enemy planes, the workers themselves took up weapons and bravely guarded the retreating machines. Yang Hengtai, a worker at the Fanrong Branch Factory, disregarded his own safety and jumped out of the air-raid shelter under the bombing of enemy planes to rescue the houses that were burned by the bombs. In the increase of production, model workers and activists emerged, which deeply educated our party members and thoroughly recognized the errors of the past. The relationship between the Party and the worker masses gradually approached.

　　On the part of the worker masses, they also began to realize that the Communist Party is the advanced and organized force of their own class, and they deeply experienced from their actual lives that the Party is always thinking about their interests. In every factory, the Party branches are leading and guaranteeing the completion of every task, and the Communist Party members and all the staff are actively overcoming all difficulties to restore production and complete the production tasks of each period, and they systematically guarantee and organize the welfare of the workers. The general branch of the Party of the Fanrong Factory, leading the Party members, played an active leading role in this war preparedness, resumption of work, and increase of production. Comrade Yang Dafang, a party member, did not rest for two consecutive nights dismantling machines. When he arrived at the destination of war preparedness, he did not stop working for three consecutive nights, which moved the workers and everyone else. Other organizations, such as the workers' union, the club, the remedial school, and the workers' canteen, were organized under the leadership and help of the Party. The Party organizations of the Qianjin Factory, Guangming Electric Light Company, Yumin Industrial Company, etc., have played a leading role in improving the welfare of workers. These have deeply moved the workers. Old Dong, a worker at the furnace platform of the Guangming Factory, said: "Without the Communist Party, where would we be today?"

　　After the Party organization was made public, the workers saw that those who had been working actively in the past were all Party members, and they felt that the Party was full of honest people, and the Party's prestige among the workers was further improved. The class consciousness of the workers in various factories who had been tested in the war preparedness, resumption of work, and production competition campaign has been further improved. Therefore, some of the estrangement that existed between the Party and the workers in the past has been eliminated. Most of the new party members took the initiative to apply to join the Party, and they wrote their own history clearly and requested the Party to review and approve it. Zhu Guifang, a fifteen-year-old female worker at the Fanrong Factory, cried bitterly and looked for party members and the general branch responsible comrades because she was too young and her request to join the party was not approved. Persisted in requesting to join the party. Someone said, "Don't cry, you can join the party when you are eighteen." She said: "I have no parents, the Party is my mother." As a result, with the approval of the Municipal Party Committee, she was approved as a probationary party member. Yu Qinghe, a worker at the Guangming Factory, came from the old liberated area. When the Party was made public, the workers said: "Workers from the old liberated area must be party members?" After hearing this, she felt very ashamed. She reviewed that the main reason for not joining the Party in the past was that her own conditions were not good enough, and she was determined to work and study more actively, correct her shortcomings, and improve her awareness in order to strive to join the Party. The newly approved party members also humbly examined themselves, feeling that their progress was not fast enough and that they were still far from the conditions of a good Communist Party member. Therefore, after joining the Party, the new party members asked to endure hardship before enjoying happiness, abide by the system, and unite the masses. Most of the new party members absorbed in these three months have the following conditions: (1) Pure background. More than ten new party members in Fanrong Factory came from the same background. They were apprentices in the factory when they were teenagers, their families were poor, and they participated in labor at a very young age. (2) High class consciousness. The motives of the new party members for joining the party are very pure. They realize that the Communist Party is the political party of their own working class, a political party that liberates all of China and all mankind. They join the party to be determined to struggle for the cause of the party and for the cause of communism. (3) Most of them are model workers and activists in the war preparedness, resumption of work, and production competition.

　　Based on the above-mentioned good conditions, one of the important tasks of the Party in Shijiazhuang factories at present is to continue to absorb progressive elements among the workers into the Party so that the Party in Shijiazhuang can obtain more fresh blood. (Zhu Bo)

　　石市党委纠正关门主义思想
  　深入工厂展开建党工作           
    五百余工人光荣入党
    【本报讯】经过去年十月以来的备战、复工、增产补损运动，石家庄各公营工厂的党的组织中，增加了五百三十三个新的党员（九月份以前共发展了二十多个党员），占公营企业中一万多工人的百分之五。这些新党员都是备战、复工、生产竞赛中的模范者和积极分子。繁荣厂在三个月中（十、十一、十二月）共发展了一百三十个党员，前进工厂发展一百零八个，北方印刷厂发展了六十个，电灯公司发展了五十七个，裕民实业公司发展了五十六个，其他光明厂、酿酒厂、福源化学等厂，共发展四十多个。这些新党员从填表那天起，在工作中就更显得积极了。
    为什么解放以后直到九月份，发展党的工作一直迟滞不前呢？这有以下几个问题：一是发展党中的关门主义。我们的干部，都是刚从农村中转到城市来的，对工人工作注意不够；其次是市委对建党工作，七月份才布置；再一个原因是，从老解放区来的党员，思想上认为石家庄这个城市经过日寇、蒋伪数次的统治，社会情况复杂，必须提高警惕性，这认识一般说来是对的；但他们强调得过分了，以至有些觉悟较高的工人，主动的接近党时，有些人却说这些人是投机分子，根本忽略了从阶级本质上来认识他们是自己的阶级弟兄。
    九月份，市委明确指出了发展党的任务，检讨了这种错误思想以后，提出密切党和群众的联系，了解工人的生活，和工人在生活上连成一片，提出党员至少要交三个到五个工人朋友，在党员思想上才有了转变。特别是经过备战复工、增产补损运动，工人发挥了从来未有的积极性和创造性，忘我的牺牲精神，使党员亲眼看到工人这种伟大的行动，错误的思想逐渐消灭了。备战中，在敌人飞机轰炸下，工人自己拿着武器，英勇的守卫在撤退的机器旁边。繁荣一分厂工人杨恒太，在敌机轰炸下，奋不顾身的从防空壕里跳出来，抢救被炸弹燃烧着的房屋。在增产中，模范者、积极分子都出现了，这些都很深刻的教育了我们的党员，彻底认识了过去思想的错误。使党和工人群众的关系逐渐靠扰了。
    在工人群众方面，也开始认识到共产党是自己阶级的先进的有组织的部队，并从他们实际生活中，深深的体验到党是处处为他们的利益打算着。各个工厂里，党的支部都在领导与保证着各个任务的完成，共产党员和全体职工一块积极的克服一切困难，为恢复生产，完成每个时期的生产任务而努力奋斗，并且有计划的保证了与组织了工人的福利事业。繁荣厂党的总支，领导着党员，在这次备战、复工、增产中，积极的起了领导作用。党员杨大方同志，拆机器连着两夜没有休息，他到备战目的地，又一连三夜没有停止工作，感动了工人，也感动了所有的人员。其他如工人职工会、俱乐部、补习学校、工人食堂等等，都是在党的领导和帮助之下组织起来的。前进工厂、光明电灯公司、裕民实业公司等党的组织，在改进工人福利事业中，都起了领导作用。这些都深深感动了工人们。光明厂炉台上的工人老董说：“没有共产党，那里能有今天。”
    经过党的组织公开后，工人们看到过去积极工作的都是些党员，他们感到党内都是老实人，党在工人中的威信更加提高了。经过备战、复工、增产竞赛运动中所考验过的各工厂工人，阶级觉悟就更加提高了。因此，消除了过去党和工人之间所存在的一些隔阂。新党员中大部是主动的要求参加党，他们都把自己的历史写的一清二白，要求党审查批准。繁荣厂十五岁女工朱桂芳，因为年龄太小，要求入党没批准，痛哭流涕，找党员，找总支负责同志。坚持要求入党。别人说：“你不要哭了，到十八岁就能参加党了。”她说：“我没爹没娘的，党就是我的亲娘。”结果经市委批准她为候补党员。光明厂工人于庆合，是从老解放区来的，在公开党的时候，工人们都说：“老解放区来的工人一定是党员？”她听了以后感到很惭愧，自己就检讨过去没有入党主要是自己条件不够，决心更加积极工作和学习，改正自己的缺点，提高自己的觉悟，以争取能够入党。被批准入党的新党员，也很虚心的检查自己，感到自己进步还不够快，离一个好的共产党员的条件还差的很远，因此新党员入党后，更处处要求吃苦在前、享受在后，遵守制度、团结群众，从这三个月中所吸收的新党员，绝大部分具备这样的几个条件：（一）出身纯洁。繁荣厂新党员中有十多个新党员，出身都是一样的，十几岁就到厂当学徒，家里穷苦，很小就参加劳动。（二）阶级觉悟高。新党员的入党动机是很纯洁的，他们认识到共产党是工人阶级自己的政党，是解放全中国、全人类的政党，自己参加党，都是要决心为党的事业，为共产主义事业而奋斗的。（三）大部分是备战、复工、生产竞赛中的模范及积极分子。
    根据以上的各种良好的条件，当前石家庄各工厂党的重要任务之一，就是继续吸收工人中的进步分子入党，使石家庄市的党，得到更多的新鲜血液。（朱波）
