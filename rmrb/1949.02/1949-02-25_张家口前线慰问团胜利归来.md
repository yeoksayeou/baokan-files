　　Zhangjiakou Frontline慰问团 Returns in Triumph
　　[Zhangyuan Telegram] The Zhangjiakou City All-Circles Frontline慰问团, having completed its visits to the various units on the Pingjin Front, has returned in triumph. The慰问团 departed on the 25th of last month and immediately proceeded to various units to conduct its visits. At various gatherings and in individual conversations, the representatives, in addition to expressing gratitude to the People's Liberation Army for the liberation of Zhangjiakou and recounting the suffering of the people under Kuomintang rule and the free and happy life after liberation, also described in detail the various preferential treatments and care given by the People's Government and the people to the families of revolutionary soldiers, and how they are respected in society, hoping that the commanders and fighters would be able to work with peace of mind and resolutely carry the revolution through to the end. They also told the soldiers who had been newly liberated from the Kuomintang reactionary army and joined the People's Liberation Army that, upon receiving notification from the government to the troops, their families would immediately be changed to People's Liberation Army families and enjoy the same treatment as the People's Liberation Army. The broad masses of commanders and fighters were very excited after listening to the reports from the representatives. In addition to expressing their gratitude to the慰劳团 representatives, they also vowed to not return home until the Kuomintang reactionaries were defeated. Bai Rugui, a soldier from the Third Battalion of the Second Regiment of a certain unit, said: "In the future, we must better serve the people, cross the Yangtze River, and liberate all of China!" Liberated soldier Han Zicheng said: "I was conscripted into the Kuomintang bandit army. Since I was liberated and received education from the People's Liberation Army, I have realized that only by defeating the Kuomintang reactionaries can the people obtain happiness. Today, in front of the慰劳团 representatives, I vow to follow the Communist Party forever and resolutely carry the revolution through to the end, and not be a half-hearted revolutionary." The leaders of the various units, in addition to welcoming and thanking the representatives, expressed particular gratitude for the support given to the troops by the people in the rear during this PingSui and Pingjin campaign; and expressed that they would definitely not betray the hopes of the elders and folks in the rear, and would certainly wipe out the Kuomintang reactionaries.

    【张垣电】张家口市各界前线慰问团，赴平津前线各部队慰问完毕，已胜利归来。慰问团自上月二十五日出发，即到各部进行慰问：各代表在各种集会上和个别谈话中除感谢解放军对张家口的解放并述说了国民党统治时人民的痛苦和解放后的自由幸福生活以外，又详细叙述了人民政府和人民对革命军人家属的种种优待和照顾，在社会上如何受到尊重等，希望指战员安心工作，坚决把革命进行到底。并告诉新从国民党反动军队中解放出来参加了解放军的战士们，在政府接到部队的通知后立即把他们的家属改变为人民解放军家属，与人民解放军享受同等待遇。广大的指战员听了各代表的报告后非常兴奋，除对慰劳团代表表示感谢外，并纷纷发誓不打倒国民党反动派不回家。某部二团三营战士白如桂说：“今后我们一定要更好的为人民服务，打过长江去，解放全中国！”解放战士韩自成说：“我是被国民党匪军抓了当兵的，自从我得到解放、受了解放军的教育后，认识到只有打倒国民党反动派人民才能得到幸福。我今天在慰劳团代表面前宣誓：永远跟着共产党走，坚决把革命进行到底，不做革命的半路人。”各部队首长除向各代表表示欢迎和谢意外，对此次平绥、平津战役后方人民对部队的支援，尤表感激；并表示决不会辜负后方父老对部队的热望，一定把国民党反动派消灭干净。
