The Fourth Special District of Chahar Province (administering Quyang, Fuping, Jianping, Jingxing, Xingtang, Pingshan, Lingshou, Zhengding, and Huolu nine counties and Zhengding City) held a production conference at the beginning of this month. Based on the current new situation and the specific conditions of the entire district, a production plan for this year was formulated. In order to ensure military and civilian food needs, it is required that the entire district increase grain production by seven sheng per mu, for a total increase of 250,000 shi (37.5 million jin); in order to ensure that urban factories do not lack raw materials, it is required to increase cotton production by 7.5 million jin (lint), expanding the cotton fields by one and a half times - planting a total of 430,000 mu of cotton, so that each mu produces 25 jin of lint, for a total output of 10 million jin of lint (last year, 175,000+ mu were planted, with each mu producing 15 jin of lint). In terms of oil crops, the goal is to plant 265,000 mu of peanuts, producing 68.25 million jin of peanuts, and 2.5 million jin of hemp seeds (an average of 1.5 jin of seeds per person in the district). In order to achieve the above goals, four professional plans have also been formulated:

　　　　Increase the Repair of Canal Beaches, Irrigate Land, and Cultivate Nurseries and Trees

Develop Water Conservancy: In the river areas of Ping (shan), Jing (xing), Jian (ping), and Ling (shou), the focus is on repairing and restoring existing canal beaches; in the plains areas of Zheng (ding), Huo (lu), Qu (yang), Xing (tang), and Ling (shou), the focus is on restoring old waterwheels and wells, and developing new wheels and new wells. It is required to complete 27 flood control projects on the Hutuo, Yanzhi, Sha, Tang, and Ci rivers, so that 74 villages are spared from floods, and 20 pieces of beach land formed by last year's冲淤—totaling 11,945 mu—are restored to their original yield; 11 pieces of destroyed wasteland will strive to be turned into 5,170 mu of formed beach land. Repair the original Lingzheng Canal, Quyang's Rongzhen Canal, Jingxing's Minzhu Canal, and other seven canals, increasing irrigation land by 21,800 mu. Build Quyang's Mozishan Canal, Fuping's Longwangzhuang Canal and Shitan Canal, Xingtang's Xikoutou Canal, and Jingxing's Zhangcun North Canal, increasing irrigation land by 1,800 mu. At the same time, it is planned to turn 6,750 mu of dry land in Jingquan into irrigated land. Develop 1,500 new waterwheels and 300 new wells, and repair 2,378 broken waterwheels and 2,225 broken wells.

Afforestation: For long-term construction, the entire district decided to plant 280,000 trees in the sandy wasteland, 420,000 trees along the rivers, and 1.8 million trees in the villages. At the same time, the North China Government directly led the establishment of the Sandy Wasteland Afforestation Committee and the Hebei Western Sandy Wasteland Afforestation Promotion Society, to create effective wind, sand, and flood prevention forest belts in spring, summer, and autumn in an organized and planned manner. Specifically, it is required that residents in mountainous and riverside areas plant five to ten trees per household, and residents in plain areas plant two to five trees per household, and it is proposed that mountains should mainly plant jujube trees, peppercorns, elms, and apricots, and plains should mainly plant grapes, locusts, and elms. In order to solve the problem of tree seedlings, it is planned to open 120 mu of sandy wasteland nurseries and 600 mu of plain nurseries. Furthermore, it is planned to complete the goal of sowing 2,000 mu on barren mountain afforestation.

　　　　Focus on Promoting Improved Varieties, Preventing Insect Pests, and Improving Technology

Promote Improved Varieties: It is planned to focus on promoting "811" millet and "Huahong No. 4" millet on 15,000 mu, promoting "72" wheat on 25,000 mu, and promoting Zhao County cotton seeds on 20,000 mu, and focusing on propagating 2,500 jin of purebred S-type cotton (2B) cotton seeds. Promote foreign sweet potato (Okinawa No. 100) seedlings on 550 mu (yield can reach 4,000 jin per mu). And attach importance to promoting Jianping's "Hong Heyan" (wheat seed), Pingshan's "Luyu Rice", Zheng (ding), Qu (yang), and Huo (lu)'s "Qing Xiaohuang" and "Mao Mao Huang" millet, and "Da Qingjie" small cotton. Shouling's radish seeds and Quyang's cabbage seeds. In terms of preventing and controlling insect pests and diseases, in addition to mobilizing the masses to soak seeds, etc., farms will also reserve a large number of medicines such as "DDT" for emergency needs. In order to ensure the smooth progress of the promotion work, in addition to attaching importance to the technical improvement of various farms, it is also planned to promote the improvement of agricultural technology through training classes, labor hero meetings, old farmer symposiums, production exhibitions, temple fairs, Yangko dances, 快板, picture books, and other methods.

　　　　Reward Livestock Breeding and Develop Sideline Specialties

Breeding Livestock: The entire district currently has 152,184 head of livestock. Each head of livestock needs to cultivate approximately 30 mu of land, so there is a feeling of insufficient animal power. The district plans to ask the Wutai Forestry and Animal Husbandry Bureau for guidance to develop the animal husbandry business of Tuoliang Mountain, requiring 4,000 head of livestock to be bred this year. Therefore, it is decided to establish 15 breeding stations, cultivate 34 heads of superior breeding livestock, and a batch of breeding technicians. And assist the masses in purchasing 4,713 head of livestock, focusing on purchasing female livestock. When the masses' strength is insufficient, one-third of the loan can be given to purchase female livestock, and one-half of the loan can be given to purchase breeding livestock. Those who achieve results in raising livestock will be rewarded, and livestock competitions will be held using mule and horse fairs to expand influence. And establish and enrich cadres at all levels of forestry and animal husbandry, strengthen their leadership, and make them professional. At the same time, on the basis of the existing 160,000 sheep in the district, develop to 222,000 to increase farmers' sideline income and fertilizer.

Sideline occupations are very important in the entire district. According to a survey in Dongwanglou Village, Pingshan, two years ago, sideline income accounted for 89% of the village's grain income – the value of sideline income was 451 dan of rice. According to the new situation, it has been specially decided to mobilize female textile workers to turn to agricultural production. In the oil pressing industry, it is planned to improve technology and tools on the original basis to reach the number of 10 million jin of oil and 45 million jin of sesame residue. Increase the prices of sheepskin, wool, and pig bristles to stimulate the development of pigs and sheep and ensure the increase in sideline production. Organize mountain farmers to produce mountain goods and medicinal materials, and promote processing (such as making wine from dates, making medicinal materials, etc.) to open up sales channels.

Specific development measures were also ordered for the transportation industry at the meeting, requiring the manufacture of 1,810 handcarts and 109 small carts in the entire district to allow goods to flow smoothly.

　　　　Strengthen Leadership, Focus Comprehensively, and Establish a Long-Term Construction Perspective

The meeting pointed out that in order to realize the above production plan, it is necessary to strengthen production leadership. First of all, in terms of leadership ideology, we must establish a long-term construction perspective and a comprehensive ideology, overcome blindness in work, and strengthen planning and organization. Not only should we focus on agriculture, but we should also pay attention to the production of industrial raw materials and support the development of industry and commerce, and do a good job in supply and marketing to connect urban and rural production.

The liberation of the labor force of the vast number of peasants after the land reform and the high enthusiasm for production have created favorable conditions for the development of production; on the other hand, after the land reform, the land, farm tools, and draught animals have become more dispersed, and the current lack of draught power and manpower. To improve production by even an inch, we must use the method of "organizing" to solve the above-mentioned difficulties. Therefore, how to vigorously develop small-scale cooperation on the basis of freedom, voluntariness, equivalent exchange, and mutual benefit has become an important link in developing production.

　　察省四专区周密研讨
  　订出今年增产计划
    【本报讯】察哈尔省四专区（辖曲阳、阜平、建屏、井陉、行唐、平山、灵寿、正定、获鹿九县及正定市）在本月初召开生产会议，根据目前的新形势及全区具体情况，制订了今年生产计划。为了保障军需民食，要求全专区每亩增粮七升，共增粮食二十五万石（三千七百五十万斤）；为保证城市工厂的原料不缺，要求增产棉花七百五十万斤（皮棉），扩大棉田一倍半——共植棉四十三万亩，使每亩产皮棉二十五斤，共出产皮棉一千万斤（去年植棉十七万五千多亩，每亩产皮棉十五斤）。在油料作物方面，达到种花生二十六万五千亩的目标，产花生六千八百二十五万斤，产大麻籽二百五十万斤（平均全区每人产籽斤半）。为了实现上述目的，并制订了四项专业计划：
    　　　　增修渠滩浇地培植苗圃林木
    发展水利：在平（山）、井（陉）、建（屏）、灵（寿）沿河地区以整修和恢复旧有渠滩为重点；正（定）、获（鹿）、曲（阳）、行（唐）、灵（寿）的平原地区以恢复旧有水车、水井和发展新车、新井为重点。要求完成滹沱、胭脂、沙、唐、慈等河的二十七处防洪工程，使七十四个村庄免于水患，将去年冲淤之成滩地二十处——计一万一千九百四十五亩，恢复原来产量；冲毁的荒滩十一处，争取变为成滩地五千一百七十亩。整修原有的灵正渠，曲阳的荣臻渠，井陉的民主渠等七条渠，增加浇地二万一千八百亩。兴修曲阳磨子山渠，阜平的龙王庄渠和石滩地渠，行唐西口头渠，井陉张村北渠，增浇地一千八百亩。同时计划把井泉六千七百五十亩旱田变为浇地。发展新水车一千五百辆，新井三百眼，并使二千三百七十八架坏水车，二千二百二十五眼坏井修复起来。
    植树造林：为了长期建设，全专区决定在沙荒中植树二十八万株，沿各河旁植树四十二万株，普遍在各村庄种植一百八十万株。同时由华北政府直接领导成立了沙荒造林委员会及冀西沙荒造林推进社，有组织、有计划的在春、夏、秋三季造成有效的防风、防沙、防洪的林带。具体要求山地和河沿地带的居民每户要植树五至十株，平原地带每户植二——五株，且提出山地以栽枣树、花椒、榆、杏，平原以种葡萄、杨槐为主。为了解决树秧问题，并拟定开设沙荒苗圃一百二十亩，平原苗圃六百亩。并且在荒山造林上计划完成播种二千亩的目标。
    　　　　重点推广优良品种预防虫灾改进技术
    推广优良品种：拟计重点的推广“八一一”谷、“华农四号”谷一万五千亩，推广“七二”小麦二万五千亩和推广赵州棉籽二万亩，有重点的繁殖纯系斯字棉（２Ｂ）棉籽二千五百斤。推广洋红薯（冲绳一百号）秧五百五十亩（产量每亩可达四千斤）。并重视推广建屏的“红和雁”（小麦种），平山的“陆羽稻”，正（定）、曲（阳）、获（鹿）的“青小黄”“毛毛黄”谷及“大青秸”小棉花。寿灵的萝＠籽，曲阳的白菜籽。在防治虫病害上，除发动群众浸种等外，并由农场储备大批药品如“Ｄ·Ｄ·Ｔ”等以为救急之需。为了推广工作的进行顺利，除重视各农场的技术改进外，并拟通过训练班、劳动英雄会、老农座谈会、生产展览会、庙会、秧歌、快板、画报等方式宣传改进农业技术。
    　　　　奖励繁殖牲畜发展副业特产
    繁殖牲畜：全专区现有牲口十五万二千一百八十四头，每头牲口约须耕地三十亩，故感畜力不足。专区拟请五台林牧局指导，发展驼梁山的牧畜事业，要求今年繁殖牲口四千头，因此，决定建立种畜站十五处，培养优良种畜三十四头及一批配种的技术人员。并扶助群众购买牲口四千七百一十三头，购买重点以买母畜为主，在群众力量不足时，购买母畜可贷款三分之一，种畜可贷款二分之一。饲养牲畜有成绩者予以奖励，利用骡马会开展牲口比赛优劣，以扩大影响。并设立与充实各级林牧干部，加强其领导，使成为专业。同时在全区现有十六万只羊的基础上，发展到二十二万二千只，以增加农民的副业收入和肥料。
    副业在全区甚重要，据平山东望楼村在前年的调查，副业收入占该村粮食收入的百分之八十九——副业收入值米四百五十一大担。根据新形势，特决定动员纺织妇女转向农业生产。在炸油业方面，拟定在原有基础上提高技术，改进工具，达到产油一千万斤，麻糁四千五百万斤的数字。提高羊皮、羊毛、猪鬃的价格以刺激猪羊的发展，保证副业的增产。组织山地农民对山货药材的生产，提倡加工（如枣作酒，制药材等），打开销路。
    运输业也在会上订了具体的发展办法，要求在全区制手推车一千八百一十辆，小型的大车一百零九辆，使货物得以畅流。
    　　　　加强领导全面着眼树立长期建设观点
    会议指出，为实现上述生产计划，就必须加强生产领导。首先是在领导思想上，要树立长期建设观点和全面思想，克服工作中的盲目性，加强计划性，组织性。不仅从农业着眼，还应注意工业原料的生产和支持工商业发展，搞好供销把城乡生产联系起来。
    土地改革后广大农民劳动力的解放，生产情绪高涨，造成发展生产的有利条件；另方面则是土地改革后，土地、农具、耕畜的愈加分散，与当前畜力人力的十分缺乏，提高生产一寸，便必须用“组织起来”的办法，来解决上述种种困难。因此，如何在自由自愿等价互利的基础上，大力发展小型合作，便成为发展生产中的重要一环。
