Xinhua News Agency, East China, 4th: After the liberation of Lianghuai City (Huaiyin, Huaian), a strategically important city in northern Jiangsu, a democratic order was rapidly established. To support mass production, the democratic government of the city has issued loans totaling 139,470,000 Hua Zhong currency (equivalent to Ji Chao and Beihai Chao, with 100 yuan equal to 1 yuan of the People's Bank of China's new currency) for handicrafts and small-scale production in the past month and a half. The city originally had 400 looms, and Huaian alone had 359 machines for weaving towels, socks, etc. During the occupation by the Kuomintang bandit troops, most of these machines were forced to shut down. Now, with the efforts of the democratic government, more than 80% have resumed operation. More than 5,400 poor households have received small-scale production loans and have been organized to engage in production activities such as transportation, mat weaving, firewood selling, and salt transportation. Most of the shops have also reopened. The city originally had seven middle schools and fifty primary schools. After the democratic government entered the city, thirty-seven primary schools resumed classes within half a month, and two joint middle schools were established. The Lianghuai People's Daily, the newspaper of the people of Lianghuai, was published on January 5th. The Lianghuai branch of the Xinhua Bookstore also officially opened on New Year's Day. Shipping between Lianghuai and Baoying, as well as highways east to Lianshui, north to Suqian, and west to the Jianghuai area, are all unimpeded. Postal routes also extend to the Northeast, North China, Northwest, Central Plains, and East China liberated areas.

　　两淮市解放后民主秩序确立
    【新华社华东四日电】江苏北部的重镇两淮市（淮阴、淮安）解放后，民主秩序迅速建立。该市民主政府为扶植群众生产，一个半月来共发放手工业及小本生产贷款华中币（与冀钞、北海钞等值，每百元合人民银行新币一元）一亿三千九百四十七万元。全市原有织布机四百部，织毛巾、袜子等机器，仅淮安一地即有三百五十九部，在国民党匪军占领时期，这些机器均大部被迫停开，现经民主政府努力扶植下已有百分之八十以上复工。五千四百余户贫民得到了小本生产贷款，已组织起来进行运输、编席、卖柴、运盐等生产。商店亦大部复业。该市原有中学七所，小学五十所，民主政府入城后，半月内即有三十七所小学复课，并成立两所联合中学。两淮人民的报纸两淮日报已于一月五日出版。新华书店两淮门市部亦于元旦正式开幕。两淮，宝应间的航船及东至涟水、北至宿迁、西至江淮地区的公路均已畅通无阻。邮路亦通达东北、华北、西北、中原、华东各解放区。
