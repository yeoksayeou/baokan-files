　　Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 18th. On February 12th, the British military authorities in West Germany had to release Lehmann, the chairman of the West German Communist Party, from the Düsseldorf prison. According to a TASS dispatch, the release order signed by British Military Governor Robertson stated: Lehmann is temporarily released from prison to enable him to attend meetings of the "Parliamentary Committee." Lehmann was illegally sentenced to three months in prison by the British military court in West Germany on February 1st. Deutsche Nachrichten commented: It was the protest storm sweeping across Germany that granted Lehmann his freedom. A protest movement, participated in by all honest German men and women and closely and sympathetically observed by the democratic public worldwide, forced the British military government to return freedom to this person who reflects the national aspirations of the German people. The British authorities have learned: "They can imprison the representatives of the people, but they cannot silence the people."

　　在全德掀起的抗议风暴中
    迫使西德英国军政府释放共产党主席雷曼
    【新华社陕北十八日电】二月十二日，西德英国军事当局不得不自杜塞尔多夫的监狱中释放了西德共产党主席雷曼。据塔斯社电称，由英国军事总督罗柏逊签字的释放令说：雷曼是暂时自狱中放出，以便使他能参加“议会委员会”的会议。雷曼是于二月一日为西德英国军事法庭非法判处徒刑三月。德意志新闻评称：使雷曼获得了自由的是全德各处掀起的抗议风暴。有一切诚实德国男女参加、并为全世界民主公众所热切而同情地注意的抗议运动，迫使英国军政府把自由还给这位反映德国人的民族愿望的人。英国当局知道了：“可以把人民的代表囚入狱中，但他们不能使人民沉默。”
