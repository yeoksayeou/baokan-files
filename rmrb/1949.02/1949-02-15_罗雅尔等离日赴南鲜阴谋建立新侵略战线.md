　　Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, February 12th: Tokyo dispatch: U.S. Secretary of the Army Royall, Director of the Operations and Planning Division of the Army Department Weidemyer and a group of aggressive "experts", after staying in Tokyo for a week, left Japan for South Korea on the 7th, and will then proceed to Okinawa and Guam. Taugh, the chairman of the American Detroit Bank who accompanied Royall to Japan, remained in Tokyo as MacArthur's "financial advisor" to supervise the implementation of the "stabilization" of the Japanese economy plan to enslave Japan. While in Tokyo, in addition to discussing assistance to the Kuomintang's resistance with MacArthur, Bardawi and others, Royall, Weidemyer and others also focused on discussing plans to step up the reconstruction of fascist Japan into an "anti-communist fortress," attempting to build a new aggressive front with Japan as its backbone, stretching from Alaska in the north to South Korea, Okinawa, and Guam in the south, after the first line of American aggression in Asia had been shattered on the Chinese mainland. Royall and Weidemyer's itinerary for this "inspection" follows precisely this line. On February 7th, when leaving Tokyo, Royall announced: "Japan must have sufficient police force," and hinted that he agreed with the opinion put forward by former U.S. Eighth Army Commander Eichelberger in accordance with the instructions of the U.S. Army Department, that is, to expand the existing 140,000 Japanese police by another 150,000. This completely exposed the U.S. conspiracy to rearm Japan. To this end, it is natural to step up the exclusion of the Japanese Communist Party and democratic forces. On February 7th, U.S. Assistant Secretary of Labor Gibson, who accompanied Royall to Tokyo, openly advocated: "Japanese trade unions should follow the example of American trade unions and expel communists."

　　罗雅尔等离日赴南鲜阴谋建立新侵略战线
    【新华社陕北十二日电】东京讯：美国陆军部长罗雅尔、陆军部作战计划处处长魏德迈等一班侵略“专家”，在东京逗留一周后，已于七日下午离日赴南朝鲜、并将转赴琉球、关岛各地。随同罗雅尔到日的美国底特律银行董事长陶奇，则作为麦克阿瑟的“财政顾问”留在东京，以监督奴役日本的“稳定”日本经济计划之进行。在东京时，罗雅尔、魏德迈等除了与麦克阿瑟、巴大维等讨论援助国民党的抵抗以外，还着重讨论了加紧重建法西斯日本为一个“反共堡垒”的计划，企图当美国在亚洲的第一道侵略战线已在中国大陆上被打碎之后，筑起以日本为中坚，北起阿拉斯加，南迄南朝鲜、琉球、关岛的新侵略战线。罗雅尔、魏德迈这次“视察”的行程，正是顺着这条线走的。二月七日，罗雅尔在离开东京时宣布：“日本必须有充分的警察力量”，并暗示他赞成前美国第八军军长艾契伯格按照美国陆军部指令所提出的意见，即在原有十四万余名的日本警察之外，再扩增十五万名警察。这完全暴露了美国重新武装日本的阴谋。为此，自然要加紧排斥日本共产党与民主力量。二月七日，随罗雅尔到东京的美国助理劳工部长吉布逊就公开主张：“日本职工会应仿效美国职工会的例子，驱逐共产党分子。”
