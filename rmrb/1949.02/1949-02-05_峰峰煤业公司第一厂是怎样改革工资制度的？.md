Last April, the North China Public Fengfeng Coal Mining Company convened a joint meeting of factory directors and labor union chairmen to review past work and propose the overall task for the future: "Mobilize all employees to practice strict economy, increase production, reduce costs, expand and improve sales, better supply military and civilian needs, and support the war." The First Mine, based on this policy, organized a work inspection team and implemented a comprehensive and in-depth inspection. The inspection revealed that the piece-rate system was implemented in the past, and workers were paid 24 catties of rice for each ton of coal produced, and the wage was not related to the business situation. According to the production statistics in March, the average was 0.66 tons per worker, and the average wage was equivalent to 17 catties of rice. The highest (ten-point worker) was 19 catties of rice per worker, and the lowest (five-point worker) was 9.5 catties of rice per worker. Due to the egalitarianism of the wage policy, capable workers were unwilling to work more, and white-collar workers (new workers) were unwilling to learn technology. At that time, the wages of small kilns were generally 12 to 14 catties of rice per worker, and it was a 12-hour work system. Therefore, in comparison, the wages of the First Mine were high, and it was an eight-hour work system, forming a phenomenon of inconsistent wages in the same area and the same department. At the same time, the enthusiasm of the workers was not fully utilized. Some workers took their wages and spent them recklessly; most workers did not want to improve their skills and did not want to work more. Furthermore, the collective wage assessment was unreasonable. For example, the highest score in the scoring regulations was ten, which restricted further improvement; the level of production was not determined by the workers' discussion, but by the cadres' assessment. Often, some workers could not get more wages for producing more, and in the collective wage assessment (ie, scoring), workers had cliquishness, with Zhang San and Li Si raising scores for each other, and cadres could also earn more points; only honest workers who did more work got fewer points, which also affected the workers' production mood. Moreover, collective scoring often prolonged the time for wage distribution due to the failure to properly evaluate a few people, which aroused the workers' dissatisfaction in the context of rising prices.

When implementing the piece-rate system, the industrial staff left many wages unattended. They did not care about labor organization and allocation, and there was no strict inspection system. There were six supervisors in the administration, who only cared about dispatching people, opening holes, and wind tunnels when they went to work. They did not consider how engineering construction should be adapted to production, how to repair roads, connect tracks, and arrange places for picking coal. Therefore, phenomena such as supporting wood where it should not be, wood that did not meet the specifications and could not pass through the pot, and filling new baskets with old ones occurred, wasting labor and materials, and hindering production. When investigating responsibility, they shirked each other.

After this inspection, everyone believed that in order to complete the new tasks, various systems, cadre work styles, labor organization, etc., must be thoroughly changed. The rationalization of the wage system in the reform is the key to solving all problems. Therefore, it was decided to start the trial of reforming the wage system on June 1, combined with the autumn production campaign. On the one hand, workers and cadres were educated, and on the other hand, the leadership studied and gained experience.

The implementation of the new wage system first stipulated the coal mining specifications and labor standards:

Several principles of coal mining specifications and labor standards—The factory devoted all its energy, combined with work inspection, to formulate a draft of coal mining specifications and labor standards. The method of direct piece-rate payment on an hourly basis with individual as a unit was adopted. In this way, a material and political encouragement foundation was laid for labor, technology improvement, and workers' creativity and enthusiasm. The past average, collective, and general labor standards were raised to technically excellent labor standards. That is to say: the standard of labor has been appropriately raised.

(1) Pickmen—Pickmen are the main link in production. If they cannot dig coal, it will affect the overall production (chariot workers cannot pull, pot workers cannot push). If the roadway is damaged, it will waste labor and materials and affect the life of the mine. Therefore, it was decided to set the labor standard for pickmen based on their excavation depth. In the coal mining specifications, six kinds of coal quality were specified, and various coal mining specifications were formulated according to the softness and hardness of the coal seam, engineering needs, roadway life, and the amount of production. Later, due to the constant changes in the softness and hardness of the coal quality and the different locations (such as water drips and floor water), the flexibility of inspection and scoring was increased. In the retreat mining, the regulations of 70% for quantity wages and 30% for quality wages were implemented. In terms of labor standards, first, those with high skills and good work attitude were studied, and the efficiency was increased by about 20% based on the existing labor level. In this way, those with high skills can give full play; for those with low skills, they are urged to work hard to learn technology, break the egalitarianism of wages, and clearly implement the principle of more work, more pay. (2) Chariot workers—The distance, curvature, and quality of the road (whether the road is flat, whether there is water, etc.), and the size of the slope have a great impact on the production of chariot workers. The size of the slope and the distance are the main factors determining the amount of production. Therefore, the method of converting the slope into a flat road was decided. According to the size of the slope and other conditions, a progressive piece-rate payment method was formulated based on the number of pots. After the chariot workers' own creation, methods such as "batch sharing" and "coal borrowing" were implemented. Because the chariots are of different sizes, and the standard for calculating wages is based on the unit of pot, if it is not enough to pull a pot, it cannot be transported. They came up with this method to overcome the phenomenon of some people not being able to finish pulling, some people not having enough to pull, or each dumping a pile, which affected production. (3) Carpenters—In the past, carpenters had the highest wages and the lowest efficiency. When formulating labor standards, the labor standards were generally increased by 30% to 70%. Then, according to permanent roadways and temporary passages, as well as special circumstances (wood size, etc.), a wage standard based on the number of timbering parts was stipulated, and a strict inspection system was implemented to prevent workers from seeking only quantity and not quality. (4) Pot pushers—There are often too many pot pushers in large kilns. Most of them are new workers who are unwilling to learn technology. Therefore, according to the size of the labor force, the distance of the road, and the past wage level, the standard of no more than 85 points was set to promote some people to change careers (learn pickmen or carpenters, etc.) to learn technology and become fixed workers. A labor standard based on the number of pots was stipulated. For each pot exceeding the standard, points were added according to the basic score ratio (the basic score is generally 55 to 60 points), which is a responsibility system of fixed wages with piece-rate rewards. As a result of the implementation, the standard was set high, and very few people exceeded it, which affected their production mood. Therefore, a guaranteed wage under special circumstances (such as parking and power outages) and a piece-rate system under normal circumstances (the method is the same as that of chariot workers) were implemented, and the results were good. (5) Odd-job workers—A fixed wage of 4 to 8 catties of rice was stipulated. If there are temporary small projects, then the spot contracting system or the piece-rate payment system is implemented. After the labor standards, coal mining specifications, and work recording methods were stipulated, the principle of clear division of labor, flexible coordination, and centralized leadership was adopted to improve the leadership structure. According to the underground production area, one industrial worker was set up in each area to be responsible for labor mobilization, major engineering construction, ventilation, drainage, large roadway excavation, and to inspect the coal mining work of the three shifts in the whole area. Under each industrial worker, there are three district teams (working in three shifts day and night), each district team has a district leader responsible for technical guidance, labor allocation, work inspection and acceptance, material requisition and distribution.... The district team is a unit for guiding and planning production. Each district team has a production committee member to assist the district leader in some political work and administrative work.

After the leadership determined the method of trying out the new system, they first carried out education and deliberation among the workers to make everyone realize that the spirit of the new system lies in benefiting both the public and the private. And pointed out the drawbacks of the past collective contracting system, excessive wages, and unfair work evaluation, which hindered the development of production. At that time, the workers' reaction was: generally, the honest workers who did well were willing to change and agreed with the piece-rate payment method, saying, "Piece-rate payment is a fair method." Some workers who used to work on corners and big chariots (similar to foremen) who usually did not work honestly and cadres who did not participate in production but could earn a lot of points expressed dissatisfaction and resisted very strongly. In addition, some old workers were accustomed to the old system, did not understand the spirit of the new system, and were unwilling to reform, saying, "I think the current method is good, why bother." In response to these reactions, in addition to patiently explaining to the workers and repeatedly explaining the rationality of piece-rate payment and the shortcomings of the collective scoring system, and conducting individual education and individual talks to some who strongly opposed it, attention was also paid to using practical examples in the trial to solve their concerns about simply fearing a reduction in wages. In the first month of changing the system—June, after the second half of the wage expenditure, most workers knew that as long as they improved labor efficiency, generally the wages they earned were not too low. Workers with skills and a good work attitude could still maintain the wage level before the system change, and individual workers even exceeded their previous wages. Grasping this point, the leadership, after propaganda and explanation, some workers with no skills or low skills quickly turned into pickmen or carpenters, and their wages gradually increased after working hard to learn technology. By July, the output was very high, and direct production reached an average of 0.7671 tons per worker, plus indirect production personnel, the total average reached 0.7072 tons. In this way, the wage level also rose in direct proportion to the efficiency. After four months of trial, this system was appropriately reduced and revised based on the actual situation. At the New Labor Representatives Conference in September, the representatives fully expressed their trust and support for the new system. For example, pickman Zhang Zuomin said: "The new system is good, no matter what others say, it cannot be shaken." Military cadre Wang Lianxi said: "In the past, I thought the new system would not work, but after several months of trial, I saw that the leadership has vision."

After this reform, the production of the First Mine has been transformed: 1. Production efficiency has been improved. Compared with the average efficiency of the four months from June to September after the system change with the previous four months, it has increased by 13%. For example, comparing the normal stage in July after the system change with the normal stage in May before the system change, the average efficiency of direct production has increased by 37%. 2. Costs have been reduced. Direct costs have been reduced by 38%; indirect costs have been relatively reduced by 12%. Therefore, the cost of each ton of coal has been reduced by 13.5 catties of rice. 3. Due to the implementation of the piece-rate payment system, staff must be realistic and personally examine and accept the work. Therefore, they can accurately calculate costs and accurately conduct economic accounting, which helps the leadership understand the true situation of production. Truly guide the work. 4. Because more work can get more, the enthusiasm of workers to learn technology has been improved. For example, Wang Zhentang, who used to push pots, turned into a pickman after the system change. As a result of working hard to learn technology, the average score in August could reach 110 points. Even some newly arrived workers felt that the new system could give play to technical abilities and not bury talents. Because everyone is enthusiastic about learning technology, according to the wage statistics in July, 52% of the workers earned an average wage of 12.75 catties of rice per worker, of which those who exceeded 100 points accounted for 18.7% of the total number.

　　峰峰煤业公司第一厂是怎样改革工资制度的？
    峰峰煤业公司经过工资制度的改革，产量逐渐提高，其中有不少具体的办法，虽然时间已经过了好几个月，但仍有参考的价值，故刊出，供研究。
　　——编者
    　　　　　　
    去年四月初，华北公营峰峰煤业公司召开了各厂厂长工会主任联席会议，检查了过去的工作，并提出今后的总任务为：“发动全体职工厉行节约，提高产量，降低成本，扩大与改善运销，更好的供应军需民用，支援战争”。一厂根据此方针组织了工作检查组，实行了全面深入的大检查。检查中发现我们过去所实行的是包工制，工人每出一吨煤发给廿四斤米的工资，工资与营业情况毫无关系。按三月份的生产统计，每工平均○·六六吨，平均工资合十七斤米，最高者（十分工的）每工十九斤米，最低者（五分工的）每工合九斤半米。由于工资政策的平均主义，使能干的工人，不愿多劳动，白脖工人（新工人）不愿学技术。当时的小窑工资，一般地是每工十二至十四斤米，而且是十二小时工作制。因之，比较之下，一厂的工资既高，又是八小时工作制，形成了同一地区同一部门工资不统一的现象。同时工人的积极性未能充分发挥，有些工人，拿了工资，吃喝浪荡；多数工人，不想改进技术不想多劳动。再就是集体评工资的不合理。如评分的规定，最高的是十分，限制了进一步的提高；产量高低，不是工人讨论决定，而是由干部评定。往往有些工人生产多了也不能多得工资，在集体评工资时（即评分数），又因工人中有宗派，张三李四互相提高分数，干部也能多挣分；只有老实的工人，做活既多评分还少，也影响了工人生产情绪。并且集体评分往往因少数人没有评好拖长发工资的时间，在物价上涨的情况下，引起工人的不满。
    工务人员在实行包工资制时，有许多工资推出不管，他们不管劳动组织与配备，没有严格的检查制度。行政上有六个监工员，上班只管派派人、开洞子、风道等工作，对工程建设如何与生产相适应、如何修路、接道轨、安排撩煤的地方等等，既不考虑筹措，更没及时的检查。因此，不该支架木的支了，木头不合规格过不去罐，用新篓填邦……等现象发生，浪费工料，妨碍生产。追究责任时，就互相推诿。
    经过这次检查，大家认为，要完成新的任务，必须把各种制度，干部作风，劳动组织等等，加以彻底改变。而改革中工资制度的合理化，又是解决一切问题的关键。于是就决定于六月一日开始，结合秋季大生产运动，初步进行改革工资制度的试验。一方面教育工人和干部，一方面领导上学习与取得经验。
    实行新工资制度，首先规定了采炭规格和劳动标准：
    采炭规格与劳动标准的几个原则——厂方以全部精力，结合工作检查，制定了采炭规格和劳动标准草案。采取以个人为单位的按时按件的直接计资办法。这样，给劳动、技术的提高，和工人的创造性、积极性，打下了物质鼓励与政治鼓励的基础。把过去平均的、集体的、一般的劳动标准，提高到技术优良的劳动标准。这即是说：把劳动的标准适当提高了。
    （一）镢工——镢工，是生产的主要一环，假如他刨不下煤来，影响全盘生产（车工不能拉，罐工不能推）。行道刨坏了，浪费工料，影响矿坑寿命。因此，决定镢工的劳动标准，以其掘进深度为标准。在采炭规格上，规定了六种煤质，以煤层软硬，工程需要，行道寿命，产量多寡…………制定了各种采炭规格。后因煤质软硬变化无常，地点好坏不同（如有淋头水，地板水等），又增加了检收增分的灵活性。在回采上，实行了数量工资七十分和质量工资三十分的规定。在劳动标准上，首先研究了技术高、劳动态度好的，按现有的劳动水平，把效率提高了百分之二十左右。这样，技术高的可以尽量发挥；对技术低的，促其努力学习技术，打破了工资的平均主义，明确的实行了多劳多得的方针。（二）车工——道路远近、弯直、好坏（路平否，有水否等）、坡度大小………对车工生产有很大影响。而坡度大小和远近，又是决定生产数量的主要因素。因此，决定了坡度折平路的办法。并按照坡度大小和其他条件，订出按罐擞累进计资办法。又经过车工自己的创造，实行了“伙批分”“借煤”等办法。因车有大小之分，而计算工资的标准，是以罐头单位，拉不够一罐，不能装运，他们想出这个办法，克服了有的拉不完，有的不够拉或各自倒一堆而影响生产的现象。（三）木工——过去以木匠工资最高，效率最低，在制定劳动标准时，一般的提高了劳动标准百分之三十至七十。再依据永恒行道与临时通道，以及特殊情况（木头尺寸等）规定了以架木件数为单位的工资标准，及严格检收制度，防止工人只求数量不求质量的毛病。（四）推罐工——在大窑中推罐的，经常人数太多，他们多是新工人，不愿学技术。遂根据劳力大小，道路远近及过去的工资水平规定不超过八十五分的标准，促使一部分人转业（学镢工或木匠等）学习技术，成为固定的工作者。并规定了以罐数为单位的劳动标准，每超过标准一罐，按基本分数比例加分（基本分一般的是五十五分至六十分），这就是固定工资按件奖励的责任制。实行的结果，因标准定的高，超过者很少，影响他们的生产情绪。所以后来又实行了特别情况下的保证工资（如停车停电等）和一般情况下的按件工资制（方法与车工同），结果良好。（五）杂工——规定固定工资四斤至八斤米，如临时有小工程，则实行点包制，或按件计资制。劳动标准、采炭规格、记工办法规定之后，又采取明确分工，机动灵活配合集中领导的原则健全领导机构。根据坑下生产地区，每区设工务员一人，负责该区（日夜三班）劳动调动，主要工程建设，通风、排水，大行掘进，并检查全区三班的采炭工作。每个工务员之下，各设三个区队（日夜三班工作）每区队设区队长一人，负责技术指导，劳力分配，验工收工，领发材料……。区队是指导和计划生产的单位。每区队设生产委员一人，襄助区队长作一些政治工作及事务性的工作。
    领导上确定试行新制度的办法之后，首先在工人群众中进行教育酝酿，使大家认识到新制度的精神在于公私两利。并指出过去集体包工制，工资过高及评工不公等流弊，妨碍发展生产。当时工人中的反映是：一般劳动好的老实工人愿意改，赞成按件计资办法，说：“按件计资是公道的办法。”过去按角的、大拉车的（类似工头）某些平常做活不老实的工人及不参加生产而能挣大分的干部表示不满意，思想抵抗很厉害，另外，有些老工人已习惯于旧的一套，不了解新制度的精神，不愿改革，说：“我看现在的办法就好，何必麻烦。”领导上针对这些反映，除向工人耐心解释，反复说明按件计资的合理性，集体评分制的毛病和对一些极力反对者进行了个别教育个别谈话外，并注意在试行中用实际事例，解决他们单纯害怕工资降低的顾虑。改制度的第一个月——六月，经过下半期工资开支，大部工人知道，只要提高劳动效率，一般地所得工资并不太低，有技术而劳动态度好的工人，仍能保持改制度前的工资水平，个别人甚至超过以前的工资。领导上抓住这点，经过宣传解释，一部分无技术或技术不高的工人，也很快转成镢工或木匠，努力学技术后，工资也逐渐提高了。到七月，产量很高，直接生产达到平均每工○·七六七一吨，加上间接生产人员，总平均达到○·七○七二吨，这样，工资水平，也与效率成正比上升了。这个制度，经过四个月的试行，把劳动标准又根据实际情形适当的降低和修正后，在九月份的新劳动者代表大会上，代表们充分的表示对新制度的信任与拥护。如镢工张作民说：“新制度就是好，无论别人怎么说，可不能动摇。”部队干部王连喜说：“过去我认为新制度行不通，经过几个月的试验，看到上级就是有眼光。”
    经过这次改革之后，一厂生产上换了一个新的面貌：一、生产效率提高了。改制度后的六月至九月四个月与前四个月平均效率相比，提高了百分之十三。如以改制度后的正常阶段七月，和未改制度时的正常阶段五月比较，直接生产平均效率提高了百分之三十七。二、成本降低了。直接成本降低了百分之三十八；间接费相对降低了百分之十二。因此，使每吨煤降低了十三斤半米的成本。三、由于按件计资制的实行，工作人员必须切合实际，亲自考工验工。所以，他们可以精确计算成本和准确经济核算，帮助了领导上了解生产上的真实情况。确实指导工作。四、因为多劳可以多得，工人学习技术热情提高了。如过去推罐的王振堂，改制度后转成镢工，努力学习技术的结果，八月份的平均分数竟能达到一百一十分。连一些新来的工人，也都感到新制度能发挥技术能力，不埋没人才。由于大家热心学技术，根据七月份的工资统计，百分之五十二的工人，平均每工工资合十二斤七两半米，其中超过一百分者，就占全数百分之十八·七。
