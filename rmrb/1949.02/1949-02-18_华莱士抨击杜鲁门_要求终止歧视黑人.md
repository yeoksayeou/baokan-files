Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 16th: TASS, Washington, 12th: The Human Rights Congress hosted a gathering here, demanding an end to segregation and discrimination against blacks. Wallace delivered a speech at the meeting, stating: Discrimination against blacks has long been America's greatest shame. He guaranteed that the Progressive Party would wage a resolute struggle for the civil rights of blacks. Wallace emphasized: America's oppression of ethnic minorities is closely linked to the Truman government's reactionary foreign policy. "Wherever there is a civil war—for example, in Greece or China—there are American guns and dollars supporting one side of the war. Wherever there are colonial peoples advancing towards the goal of freedom—for example, in Vietnam, Indonesia, and elsewhere—those people encounter American-made tanks. We see narrow-minded patriotism in Germany, restored to power with the support of American military leaders. We see the American government's representative in Japan openly rejoicing at the restoration of rule by the remnants of the Japanese war clique." Wallace contrasted Truman's human rights protection program with Truman's support for the segregation of blacks from participating in the American army. He said: Last November, voters who hoped to enact laws confirming the true equality of all citizens were deceived by a "government that supports segregation measures."

　　华莱士抨击杜鲁门
  　要求终止歧视黑人
    【新华社陕北十六日电】塔斯社华盛顿十二日讯：人权保障大会在此间主持了一个集会，要求终止对黑人的隔离和歧视。会上华莱士发表演说称：对黑人的歧视，早已成为美国的最大耻辱。他保证进步党将为黑人的公民权利进行坚决的斗争。华氏着重指出：美国对于少数民族的压迫，是和杜鲁门政府反动的外交政策密切连系着的。“那里有着内战——例如希腊或中国，那里就有美国枪炮的装备和美元在支持战争的一方。那里有殖民地人民向着自由的目标前进——例如越南、印尼及其他地方，那里的人民就遇着美国制的坦克。我们看见狭隘爱国主义的德国、在美国军事领袖的扶持下恢复了权柄。我们看见美国政府在日本的代表对于日本战争集团残余分子的恢复统治，公开地表示欢欣。”华莱士把杜鲁门的保护人权纲领和杜鲁门对于隔离黑人不得参加美国军队这一主张的支持，作一对照。他说：去年十一月希望制定确认一切公民真正平等的法律的选民们，是被“支持隔离措施的政府”所欺骗了。
