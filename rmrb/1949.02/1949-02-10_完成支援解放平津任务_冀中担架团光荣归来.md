　　【Jizhong Telegram】With the complete liberation of Tianjin and Beijing, 106 stretcher companies with 13,780 people from the 8th, 9th, and 11th Sub-districts of Jizhong, and 101 transfer stretcher companies with 13,130 people from the 8th and 11th Sub-districts of Jizhong, gloriously returned around the Lunar New Year. Before their departure, they were warmly seen off by the troops and local people. The stretcher teams from Hejian, Renqiu, and other counties also received award banners from the troops. In carrying out their tasks, they carried forward the glorious tradition of the Jizhong people to move forward bravely. The stretcher team from Xianjiao transported wounded soldiers from Miaogezhuang to Liuquan, completing the task at a speed of 60 *li* in 12 hours. Wang Bingchen of the 8th Company carried for 60 *li* without asking for a replacement. Da Heiguo (person's name) of the 1st Company and Tong Junliang of the 2nd Company did not rest even with sores on their legs. Wang Qingchen of the 4th Company was ill and hadn't eaten much for three days, but nothing could stop him from carrying the wounded. Everyone rushed to carry the wounded onto the stretchers, covered them with their own quilts, and carried them gently, steadily, and quickly. When the wounded wanted water, people took out money to buy sugar for them. When the wounded needed to defecate, Zhang Lifeng and Li Yushu, two squad leaders of the 6th Company, rushed to use their hands to help the wounded and comforted them kindly. The six companies from Xianjiao dug 1,598 *zhang* of trenches and broke 180 *zhang* of ice in three days. Their cotton trousers were soaked with sweat, and their shoes and socks were soaked with ice water; they scooped out chunks of ice weighing forty or fifty *jin* from their shoes. Ma Fusheng's feet were frostbitten, but he resolutely continued. When tens of thousands of carts transported grain, they also helped load and unload the carts. When the 2nd and 7th Companies from Xianjiao were watching the warehouse, squad leader Liu Qingyi unloaded forty-seven carts one morning. Xia Genmiao, the second platoon leader, and Yuan Jincai, Tian Jinshan, and others unloaded 150 carts in half a day. They worked well and had good discipline. They often took the initiative to do mass work, helping landlords cut grass, carry water, sweep the yard, and mix manure, which was warmly welcomed by the people in the new districts, who automatically wanted to light coal fires for them and send them vegetables, but they politely declined. At the glorious farewell meeting, groups of landlords came out to see them off. After both sides saluted each other, He Wenyuan, a representative from Dongchu Village in Anci, said: "We must learn from you and follow you to carry stretchers to fight Nanjing." The laborers unanimously shouted: "Let's join hands and fight all the way to Nanjing!" When the stretcher teams marched off in formation, the landlords and the masses saw them off for a long distance. The laborers instructed them: "Live a peaceful life! Don't forget the Communist Party!"
