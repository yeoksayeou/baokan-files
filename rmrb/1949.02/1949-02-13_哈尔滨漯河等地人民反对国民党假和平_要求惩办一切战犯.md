Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 11th. From Harbin to Luohe, people from all walks of life in the old and newly liberated areas have condemned the Kuomintang bandit gang's peace conspiracy and warmly supported the eight peace conditions proposed by Chairman Mao. Many workers' unions in Harbin enthusiastically discussed Chairman Mao's statement, believing that it represented the opinions of the people across the country, and the workers automatically carried out propaganda to residents of various streets. Old man Kong, who has worked in a railway factory for 30 years, said angrily when he heard that the Kuomintang was carrying out a "peace" conspiracy: "That won't work! Why didn't the Kuomintang talk about peace when they attacked Yan'an?" Students from various schools in Jilin City believed that in the past under the rule of the Kuomintang, they ate stir-fried bean dregs and leaves, and were often beaten by secret agents. That was the "minimum living standard" that Chiang Kai-shek wanted the people to maintain. Yidu County, Shandong, held a victory celebration meeting. At the meeting, the family member of a martyr, Lao Dehuai, shouted loudly: "Never be fooled by the reactionaries, don't let our children's blood be shed in vain!" The people of all strata in Luohe, Henan, because they had only recently been liberated, still had vivid memories of the Kuomintang's crimes. Therefore, they particularly supported the "punishment of war criminals" clause in Chairman Mao's eight peace conditions, believing that without this clause, it would be like cutting grass without removing the roots, and it would definitely sprout again. Ironworker Ma Qiming said: "The Kuomintang is now making a fuss about a truce. I think we must stand firm and not be fooled. On the fourth day of the new year, I will call the apprentices back to work and drive spikes, and quickly repair the railway to transport troops across the Yangtze River." Stevedore Zhao Wenyuan said: "Chairman Mao's statement on abolishing the pseudo-legal system truly represents the opinions of us ordinary people. In the famine of the 32nd year of the Republic of China, my brother starved to death; because he could not pay the Kuomintang government's donations, three acres of land were also taken by the chief of the baojia, and my father died in the Public Security Bureau. If the pseudo-legal system is not abolished, there will be no way for us poor people to survive." Huang Songgui said: "There is a ballad in the Kuomintang army: The First Principle of the People wants military food, the Second Principle of the People wants cash, and the Third Principle of the People wants girls. Such a disastrous army must be reorganized." Businessman Lu Peizhen said: "Businessmen most support the confiscation of bureaucratic capital and the abolition of traitorous treaties. After these two clauses are implemented, businessmen will never be oppressed by bureaucratic capital or invaded by imperialist economies, and industry and commerce can be freely developed." An old gentleman read Chairman Mao's statement over and over again in the people's education center, and finally said: "Chairman Mao's words are all true and represent the opinions of our people." The Ping-Sui Railway Bureau and the Ping-Sui Railway Trade Union also held a meeting of directly affiliated employees on the first day to discuss the current situation. Finally, they passed a telegram to Chairman Mao to support the eight conditions and oppose the Kuomintang's false peace.

　　哈尔滨漯河等地人民
  　反对国民党假和平
  　要求惩办一切战犯
    【新华社陕北十一日电】由哈尔滨到漯河，新老解放区的各界人民都纷纷斥责国民党匪帮的和平阴谋，热烈拥护毛主席所提出的八项和平条件。哈尔滨许多区工人联合会热烈地讨论了毛主席的声明，认为代表了全国人民的意见，工人们并自动向各街居民进行宣传。在铁路工厂作工三十年的孔老汉听到国民党进行“和平”阴谋时愤怒地说：“那不行！国民党打到延安时为什么不讲和？”吉林市各校学生认为他们过去在国民党统治下，吃炒豆渣和树叶，还动轧受特务殴打，那就是蒋贼要人民维持的“最低生活水平”。山东益都县举行祝捷大会，会上烈士家属牢德怀大声喊道：“决不要上反动派的当，叫我们孩子的血白流啊！”河南漯河各阶层人民，因光复不久，对国民党罪恶记忆犹新，因此他们对于毛主席的八项和平条件，特别拥护“惩办战争罪犯”一条，认为没有这一条就是割草不除根，必定再发芽。铁工马启明说：“国民党现在又闹停战，我看咱们要把脚根站稳，别上他的当。到初四我就把学徒叫回来开工打道钉，赶快把铁路修好运兵过长江。”起卸工人赵文员说：“毛主席说的废除伪法统真是代表咱们老百姓的意见，民国三十二年闹饥荒我哥哥饿死了；因为纳不上国民党政府的捐，三亩地也叫保长霸去了，父亲被押在公安局死了，伪法统要不废除，就没有咱穷人的活路。”黄松贵说：“国民党的军队里有个歌谣是：一民主义要军粮，二民主义要现洋，三民主义要姑娘。这样祸国殃民的军队，是非改编不行的。”商人陆培真说：“商人最拥护没收官僚资本和废除卖国条约这两条。这两条实行之后，商人就可以永远不受官僚资本的压迫和帝国主义经济的侵略，工商业都可得到自由发展。”一位老先生在民教馆一遍又一遍地读着毛主席的声明，最后说：“毛主席说的句句是真情，都是代表咱们人民的意见。”平绥铁路局及平绥路总工会，亦于一日召开直属职工会议，座谈时局，最后通过致电毛主席拥护八项条件，反对国民党的假和平。
