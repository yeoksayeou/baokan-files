Xinhua News Agency, Beiping, February 11th – People from all walks of life in Beiping are protesting the rumors spread by American reporters. After seeing the slanderous articles by Mosa of the Associated Press and Keough of the United Press against the people of Beiping, workers, students, democrats, professors, and journalists in Beiping were outraged. Li Yaozeng, Tang Guishan, and 19 other workers from the internal and external lines of the Jibei Electric Power Company's Beiping branch, declared: This is a great insult to the people of Beiping, and the slanderers must apologize to all the people of Beiping. Tram worker Zhang Rubang said: "We can't let them off this time. People all over the world have suffered enough from these imperialist rumor-mongering experts. We must unite with the people of the world to tear off their ugly masks." Cart driver Liu Guanfu said: "When the Japanese, Americans, and Kuomintang came, we were always beaten and bullied. Who do our workers welcome? Of course, the Communist Party!" Another worker, Shi Denghua, refuted with facts: "When we welcomed the People's Liberation Army, we could sit on their artillery vehicles and write on the bodies of the PLA soldiers. Who would dare to do that to American soldiers or Kuomintang troops?"

Students in Beiping, who have a glorious history of struggle, shouted the slogan "American soldiers get out of China!" again after reading the American reporters' slanderous reports, a slogan from the anti-American atrocities campaign the year before. Students from Beijing, Tsinghua, Normal, Yanjing, Chaoyang, Sino-French, Northeast, Fu Jen, Nanhe and other sixteen colleges and universities have issued a solemn protest, unanimously demanding the expulsion of American reporters who insulted the Chinese people. The entire faculty, students, staff, and police of Normal University said in a letter of protest: "The people of Beiping still deeply remember the Shen Chong incident of December 25th, the year before last. The people and students of Beiping had a large-scale anti-atrocity campaign. If you American rumor-mongering reporters are not forgetful, the people of Beiping will give a strong answer with this kind of action."

Democrats and university professors in Beiping also made statements to refute severely. Hu Yuzhi, head of the Nanyang General Branch of the Democratic League, said: "As a member of the free people of Beiping, I propose that the headquarters of the People's Liberation Army order the expulsion of these two American imperialist reporters and never allow them to return to the territory of the Chinese people." Zhou Jianren said: "The People's Liberation Army is the people's army, and it is natural for the people of Beiping to welcome them. These American reporters see that the PLA's weapons are all things captured from the American accomplices, so they are naturally sad and heartbroken." Wu Han, a professor at Tsinghua University, said: "The joyous mood of the Chinese people and the people of Beiping after the liberation of Beiping is because we have been waiting for this day for too long. Mosa and his ilk will soon be able to hear this strong emotion in Shanghai, Nanjing, Taiwan, and other places. Please note that I only say hear, not see, because the people in those places will not treat liars like you." Lei Jieqiong, a professor at Yenching University, said: "Writing news like this is simply a disgrace to the press. These two reporters should at least apologize to the Chinese people. I hope the People's Government will restrict such incorrect speech." Wen Jiasi, a professor at Peking University, warned the mouthpiece reporters of the imperialists in the capacity of personally participating in welcoming the People's Liberation Army: "I also welcomed the People's Liberation Army as a citizen that day. From 9:00 am to 2:00 pm, a full five hours, I did not see at all that 'this is not a reflection of the general public sentiment.' We must at least give a warning to these American imperialist pawns for their reckless rumors and deliberate distortion of facts." Professor Xu Deheng said: "It is completely unfounded and inconsistent with the facts to compare the actions of the citizens of Beiping welcoming the People's Liberation Army this time with the 'welcoming' of the Kuomintang army under the coercion of the Baojia chiefs and instructors in the past." Professor Yuan Hanqing said: "Their reports are enough to constitute grounds for expulsion. We not only want them to leave Beiping, but also to leave the entire Liberated Area."

A group of Beiping journalists pointed out in a statement refuting the American reporters' rumors: "We are journalists in Beiping and have witnessed the grand occasion of the people of Beiping celebrating the liberation. We cannot sit idly by and watch the scum of the press slander the people of Beiping. We demand that the Beiping People's Liberation Army Military Control Commission and the Beiping People's Government immediately stop the illegal activities of American reactionary reporters and American reactionary news agencies and expel Keough and Mosa, who slander the people of Beiping."

　　撕破美帝记者鬼脸把他们逐出解放区
    北平人民继续抗议美记者诽谤
    【新华社北平十一日电】北平各界人民纷纷抗议美记者造谣。在看到了美联社记者穆萨与合众社记者基昂诽谤北平人民的文字以后，北平市的工人、学生、民主人士、教授和新闻工作者，都沸腾起来了。冀北电力公司北平分公司的内外线两股工人李耀增、唐贵山等二十一人声明：这是对北平人民的莫大污辱，要诽谤者向全北平人民道歉。电车工人张汝榜说：“这次可不能放松他们。世界人民受这类帝国主义造谣专家的气可多着哩。我们要联合全世界的人民，共同来扯破他们的鬼脸。”排子车工人刘惯福说：“日本人、美国人、国民党他们来了，我们都是挨打受气。咱们工人欢迎谁？当然欢迎共产党！”另一个工人史登华更用事实驳斥道：“我们欢迎解放军时，可以坐到解放军的炮车上，往解放军战士的身上写字。对美国兵、国民党军谁敢这样？”
    有光荣斗争历史的北平学生在读到美国记者的诽谤报导后，又喊出了前年反抗美军暴行时的口号：“美军滚出中国去！”北京、清华、师范、燕京、朝阳、中法、东北、辅仁、南和等十六个专科以上学校的学生们，已发了严正的抗议书，一致要求驱逐侮辱中国人民的美记者出境。师范大学的全体师生工警，在抗议书上这样说：“全北平市的人民到现在依然深深的记得前年十二月二十五日的沈崇事件，全北平市的人民及学生，曾有过大规模的抗暴行动。假如你们美国造谣记者不健忘的话，全北平市的人民，就将以此种行动作一个有力的答复。”
    在平的民主人士和大学教授，也纷纷发表谈话严予驳斥。民主同盟南洋总支部负责人胡愈之说：“作为北平的自由人民的一分子，我主张人民解放军总部下命令，把这两名美帝国主义的记者，驱逐出境，永远不准他们再回到中国人民的国土。”周建人说：“解放军是人民的队伍，北平人民起来欢迎，这是当然的。这些美记者们看到了解放军的武器都是缴获美国帮凶的东西，他们当然难过、痛心。”清华大学教授吴晗说：“中国人民、北平人民在北平解放后的狂欢情绪，是因为我们等待这个日子已经太长久了。这种强烈的情绪，穆萨们不久还可以在上海、南京、台湾等地方听到。请注意我只说听到而不说看到，因为，那些地方的人民将不会款待象你们这样的说谎者。”燕京大学教授雷洁琼说：“这样写消息，简直是新闻界的败类。这两个记者，最低应向中国人民道歉。希望人民政府应限制这种不正确的言论。”北大教授闻家驷以亲身参加欢迎解放军的资格警告帝国主义者的御用记者道：“欢迎解放军那天，我也以市民资格去欢迎过，从早上九点到下午二点，整整五个钟头，我一点也没有看出‘这不是一般人民情绪的反映’。对这些美帝国主义爪牙的胡乱造谣，有意歪曲事实，至少我们必须给予警告。”许德珩教授说：“把这次北平市民欢迎解放军的行动和以前在保甲长、训导长强迫之下‘欢迎’国民党军相提并论，是完全没有根据和不合事实的。”袁翰青教授说：“他们的报导已经够构成驱逐出境的条件了。我们不但要他们离开北平，而且要他们离开全解放区。”
    一批北平新闻记者在驳斥美记者造谣声明中指出：“我们是北平的新闻工作者，对北平人民庆祝解放的倾城狂欢的盛况，耳闻目睹。我们不能坐观新闻界的败类向北平人民污蔑，我们要求北平人民解放军军事管制委员会和北平人民政府，即刻停止美国反动记者及美国反动新闻机关的非法活动，并将污蔑北平人民的基昂和穆萨驱逐出境。”
