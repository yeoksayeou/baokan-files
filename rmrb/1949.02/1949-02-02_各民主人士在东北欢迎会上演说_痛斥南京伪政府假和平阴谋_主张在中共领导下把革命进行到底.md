Xinhua News Agency, Shenyang, 31st. The Northeast Central Bureau of the CCP, the Northeast Government Committee, the Northeast Military Region of the People's Liberation Army, and representatives from all sectors of the Northeast held a grand welcome meeting on the 26th of this month to warmly welcome the national democratic parties, people's organizations, and non-party democratic figures who have arrived in the Northeast Liberated Area to attend the New Political Consultative Conference. Those attending the welcome rally included: Li Jishen, Shen Junru, Ma Xulun, Guo Moruo, Tan Pingshan, Peng Zemin, Zhang Bojun, Cai Tingkai, Zhang Naiqi, Li Dequan, Sha Qianli, Mao Dun, Zhu Xuefan, Chen Qiyou, Huang Zhensheng, Zhu Yunshan, Deng Chumin, Wang Shao'ao, Xu Guangping, Qiu Zhe, Feng Yufang, Xu Baoju, Hong Shen, Hou Wailu, Cao Mengjun, Shi Fuliang, Sun Qimeng, Li Minxin, Mei Gongbin, Shen Zhiyuan, Wu Maosun, Lin Yiyuan, Lai Yali, Kong DeQiong, a total of thirty-four people. The meeting began at 2 p.m. First, Lin Feng, Chairman of the Northeast Administrative Committee, delivered a welcoming speech. He first extended a warm welcome on behalf of the Northeast Central Bureau of the CCP, the Northeast Government Committee, the Northeast Military Region, and the people of all circles in the Northeast to the national democratic parties, people's organizations, and non-party democratic figures who have been struggling arduously for the cause of democracy in the Kuomintang-controlled areas for a long time. Subsequently, Li Jishen, Shen Junru, Ma Xulun, Guo Moruo, and other twenty people successively delivered speeches at the meeting, unanimously denouncing the Nanjing Kuomintang's false peace plot, supporting Chairman Mao Zedong's statement on the current situation by the Central Committee of the CCP, and advocating carrying the revolution through to the end under the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party.

　　Mr. Li Jishen, Chairman of the Revolutionary Committee of the Chinese Kuomintang, first talked about his views on the Chinese Communist Party in his speech, believing that the reason why the Chinese people's democratic revolution has achieved such great achievements today is due to the correct leadership and appropriate measures of the CCP, which truly meet the needs of the broad masses of the people throughout the country. Secondly, he talked about his impressions of the liberated areas. He said: Seeing that the general public truly enjoy the happiness of democracy and freedom, that production and construction have made rapid progress, especially that mobilizing the strength of the people has been the greatest success, and that the CCP members lead the people's work with arduous efforts and the People's Liberation Army is incomparably heroic, it is admirable. Mr. Li Jishen said when talking about the US-Chiang peace offensive: Just as the Chinese people's democratic revolution is approaching complete victory, Chiang Kai-shek suddenly issued a New Year's Day broadcast, making a gesture of seeking peace, but at the same time, he wanted to maintain his pseudo-constitution and pseudo-legitimacy, and to "deal with the Communist Party to the end." Three weeks later, he ran away. Judging from the various arrangements he made before his "retirement," it can be proved that he still wants to direct everything behind the scenes. Judging from the various activities of the Nanjing reactionary regime, the Kuomintang's peace offensive can be asserted to be a big conspiracy completely instigated by US imperialism, attempting to use the good name of peace to maintain their feudal remnant forces and hinder the complete success of the Chinese revolution. Chairman Mao Zedong of the CCP issued a solemn statement on January 14, exposing the hypocritical peace conspiracy of the US-Chiang reactionaries, and put forward eight genuine democratic peace conditions. These eight conditions can be said to fully represent the unanimous public opinion of all revolutionary democratic parties, democratic groups, democratic figures, and even the people of the whole country. Only by accepting these eight conditions can the Nanjing reactionary regime achieve genuine democratic peace, and only by promoting the realization of these eight conditions can the people of the whole country guarantee genuine democratic peace. I hope that the people of the whole country will unite to oppose false peace and strive for true peace.

　　Mr. Shen Junru, Standing Committee Member of the Central Committee of the China Democratic League, said in his speech: After entering the liberated area, he saw the true democracy and freedom of the people. Here, there are no aggressive forces of imperialism, no four major families, and no feudal landlords, warlords, or bureaucrats. Here, there are the people who have turned over, the workers and peasants who have become the masters of the country. What I have seen and heard in a short period of time in the Northeast Liberated Area has fully proved that the creative power of the liberated people is great and astonishing. Wherever the People's Liberation Army advances, the people there organize to support the front lines. In the factories, the workers consciously improve production methods and increase production efficiency. In the countryside, the liberated farmers automatically hand in public grain and compete to join the stretcher teams. These are all seen with our own eyes in the places we have passed. This is a historic and earth-shattering transformation, sending the reactionary rule of imperialist feudal forces and bureaucratic capital to the grave. We must not forget that the reason why the oppressed people have been able to create this unprecedented historical transformation is because they have the leadership of the great Chinese Communist Party and the wise leader Mr. Mao Zedong. We cannot but pay the most lofty respect to the great CCP and Mr. Mao Zedong. From the liberation of Jinan and the entire Northeast to the great victories of Huaihai and Pingjin, the People's Liberation Army has annihilated more than one million enemies, thus making the Nanjing reactionary rule, which is full of heinous crimes, truly on the verge of disintegration. Chiang Kai-shek, the number one killer and war criminal, actually began to sing the tune of peace. Three years ago, he sabotaged the resolutions of the Political Consultative Conference and blatantly launched an anti-communist and anti-people civil war in disregard of the opposition of the people of the whole country. Were these also for "peace"? This "peace" was to preserve his four major families' reactionary rule, which is clear to everyone. However, after all, the words of Chiang Kai-shek, the great butcher and war criminal, did not attract much attention from the people, so he "retired" to the background according to the well-arranged conspiracy, and let Li Zongren, Sun Ke, and other reactionary leaders come to the front. Recently, I learned from the broadcast news that Li Zongren had a letter to several members of the Democratic League, and even mentioned my name. As everyone knows, isn't Li Zongren also a war criminal? The Democratic League has fundamentally denied their constitution and legitimacy. What is there for us to talk about with them? The people will not talk peace with Li Zongren, Sun Ke, and other war criminals. They should be punished by the people. If we really want to negotiate, we must first unconditionally accept and implement Mr. Mao Zedong's eight peace conditions. This is the minimum prerequisite. It is absolutely impossible to lack one. If the reactionary regime, which is about to be destroyed by the people, wants to use peace negotiations to缓和the revolutionary offensive,分散the unity of the revolutionary camp, in order to preserve its remaining reactionary forces, then the people of the whole country will surely use double the strength to crush this conspiracy and trick. At the same time, I want to report one thing to everyone, that is, the Central Headquarters of the China Democratic League recently decided to move into the Liberated Area, and will soon complete the migration work. We will continue to consolidate unity with other democratic parties and strive to completely, thoroughly, and cleanly eliminate the reactionary rule of imperialism, feudal forces, and bureaucratic capital over the Chinese people, and complete the people's democratic revolution.

　　Mr. Ma Xulun, Standing Director of the China Association for Promoting Democracy, emphasized in his speech that only by thoroughly overthrowing imperialism, feudal forces, and bureaucratic capitalism can a new China of democracy, freedom, peace, and unity be established. For decades, the Chinese revolution has not been thorough, that is because imperialism has controlled the domestic feudal dictatorial regime and produced bureaucratic capital. The people are suffering from heavy oppression and exploitation, falling into a deep pit of suffering, and there is no way to enjoy any freedom or democracy. Although the Kuomintang reactionary group is constantly slandering the liberated areas and the Communist Party, only in the liberated areas under the leadership of the Communist Party can true freedom and democracy be realized. This visit to the liberated area has further confirmed this point through personal experience. Regarding the issue of peace talks, Mr. Ma Xulun said that what we are striving for is true peace, not a sloppy compromise. Therefore, we must thoroughly overthrow the revolutionary objects such as imperialism, feudal forces, and bureaucratic capitalism. It is by no means a simple matter of Chiang Kai-shek's "retirement." The Kuomintang reactionary government can only achieve true peace by fully accepting Chairman Mao's eight conditions. In order to accelerate the victory of the revolution, the front should step up operations, advance bravely, and the rear should step up production and strive to support the front.

　　The famous revolutionary writer and historian Mr. Guo Moruo said that the current US-Chiang attempts to cover up their military struggles with peace conspiracies. After Chiang Kai-shek slipped out of Nanjing, he left a Li Zongren as a rearguard, so that he could buy time and linger on. Li Zongren is staying in Nanjing today, desperately carrying out the US-Chiang mission, conducting a peace offensive, and openly extending his hypocritical peace tentacles into our democratic camp. In his public telegram to Mr. Li Renchao, he shamelessly asked our "peace-loving democrats in the north" to go to Nanjing to negotiate peace with him. He really doesn't know the immensity of heaven and earth. Li Zongren is a top war criminal, and his crimes are no less than those of Chiang Kai-shek. If Chiang Kai-shek slipped away, Li Zongren should be held accountable and made to pay back the blood debt of the Chinese people. Mr. Guo Moruo said: In order to achieve true democratic peace, my opinion is to take Chairman Mao Zedong's opinion as my opinion. Mr. Mao is the great people's leader who reflects the people's public opinion most correctly, most centrally, most completely, and most rapidly. The eight articles put forward by Mr. Mao in his statement on the current situation on the 14th of this month fully reflect the public opinion of the Chinese people. All democratic parties, people's organizations, and democratic figures in China are also wholeheartedly willing to unite under the leadership of Mao Zedong, under the leadership of the proletarian vanguard, the Chinese Communist Party, just like a whole, and are determined to thoroughly fight for the realization of the people's public opinion and strive for true peace.

　　Mr. Tan Pingshan, the white-haired Chairman of the Three People's Principles Comrades Association, expounded in his speech that the revolution must be carried through to the end, and emphasized the painful lessons of the Revolution of 1911 on this issue. He said: The Revolution of 1911 did have successes, but the lessons of failure must be remembered even more. He believes that the main failures of the Revolution of 1911 were four: First, and also the biggest failure, was the compromise with various counter-revolutionary forces, especially Yuan Shikai. Second, the impurity of the revolutionary camp, including reactionary saboteurs, destroyed the united front of the revolution and weakened the revolutionary forces. Third, a middle line emerged, such as Song Jiaoren at the time, who believed that revolutionary means should no longer be adopted during the nation-building period, but advocated parliamentary struggle, and as a result, he himself died at the hands of Yuan Shikai. Fourth, they failed to resolutely preserve and grasp their own revolutionary armed forces, causing the fruits of the revolution to lose their guarantee. At this point, Mr. Tan said: The Chinese people will not repeat these historical lessons today. The current Chinese revolution, under the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party, will surely move towards victory thoroughly.

　　Mr. Peng Zemin, Chairman of the Southern General Branch of the Democratic League, said in his speech: Only under the correct leadership of the Chinese Communist Party and Mr. Mao Zedong can the Chinese people turn over. Only then can China achieve true democracy, independence, and peace. The Nanjing reactionary group is completely a tool for US imperialism to invade China. Now that it sees that the people's revolutionary forces can no longer be contained, it signals Chiang Kai-shek to "retire" and calls for "peace" in an attempt to confuse the people and preserve the remaining reactionary forces. If the reactionaries do not implement Mr. Mao's eight peace conditions, we must rush to pursue them and not give them a moment to breathe. We must only take the path of thorough revolution, there can be no second path, and no opposition is allowed. Let us unite, smash the conspiracies of US imperialism, expose the peace tricks, achieve complete victory, and establish a new China of democracy, independence, and prosperity.

　　Mr. Zhang Bojun, Chairman of the Chinese Peasants' and Workers' Democratic Party and Standing Committee Member of the Central Committee of the China Democratic League, expressed three opinions. First, he believes that today's welcome meeting shows that all parties and democratic figures in the country are united under the leadership of the CCP, which has great historical significance. This unity shows that the democratic forces under the leadership of the CCP are incomparably great, and the shameful bankruptcy of Chiang and the US's rumors and slanders against the liberated areas. With the leadership of the CCP and the cooperation of all parties, China will be rapidly built into a strong country, so that imperialism will not dare to have any delusions about China. Second, the upcoming Political Consultative Conference is a revolutionary Political Consultative Conference under the leadership of the Communist Party without the participation of reactionary elements. The basic spirit and essence are different from the old Political Consultative Conference. We are very optimistic about holding this conference. Third, now some people advocate engaging in opposition within the democratic camp. Those who put forward this fallacy are either mentally ill patients, or they are hired by American bosses, or they are deceived by British and American textbooks. Democratic party figures should obviously not have this point of view, nor are they allowed to participate in this route. Finally, Mr. Zhang Bojun stated: Li Zongren's telegram to the Democratic League has my name. He is a top war criminal and is no longer qualified to talk to us about peace issues, so there is no need to answer him.

　　Mr. Cai Tingkai, the person in charge of the Chinese Kuomintang Democratic Promotion Association, recalled in his speech that the reason why China's past revolutions failed was because the revolution was not thorough enough, so that even today, except for the People's Liberation Army, the people in various places are still in deep water. The suffering of the people is caused by US imperialism and its running dogs, with Chiang Kai-shek as the head of the Nanjing reactionary regime. Speaking of the current situation, he said: Chiang Kai-shek, Li Zongren, Sun Ke, and their masters, US imperialism, seeing that their rule is about to completely collapse, have successively wailed for peace. Chiang Kai-shek also announced the so-called "retirement." These are all conspiracies, attempting to deceive the people and linger on. We must not be deceived. We need peace, but what we need is to drive US imperialism out of China, eradicate feudal remnants, confiscate bureaucratic capital, and the people get a true, free, and democratic and permanent peace. Mr. Cai Tingkai said: Mr. Mao Zedong's eight peace conditions in his statement on the current situation are the basic conditions for achieving a true, permanent, democratic peace, and are also the peace conditions required by the people of the whole country. All democratic parties should closely unite and cooperate, strive to achieve these conditions, and strive for permanent peace and the establishment of a new democratic China.

　　Mr. Zhang Naiqi, Standing Director of the Democratic National Construction Association, praised the various constructions of the liberated areas in his speech. He said that the great power of the people in the liberated areas was beyond my expectations in the past. This is a true people's society, and such a bright era as the liberated areas has never been found in Chinese history. Then talking about the current situation, he said: Now the Kuomintang is completely collapsing militarily, and they are attempting to stop the revolution with soft methods and peace conspiracies, so that the revolution will be abandoned halfway. Revolutionary war is like a very big painting. If only half of it is painted and stopped, how can it be done? Similarly, if this half of China is liberated, but the other half cannot be liberated, not only will the people in the liberated areas not be willing, but the more than 200 million people in the Kuomintang-controlled areas who are living in dire straits will not allow it.

　　Ms. Li Dequan, Chairman of the All-China Women's Federation, said: Chinese women have been oppressed for thousands of years, and today they have good days under the leadership of Chairman Mao of the Communist Party. The Northeast Women's Congress held the other day fully demonstrated that women have turned over. Female workers have become the masters of the factory. More than 100 rural women representatives are mostly labor heroes. They participated in land reform and obtained a piece of land. The government also issued them land certificates. This is something that has never happened in Chinese history. These facts tell us that we must serve the truly free, independent, and democratic country under the leadership of Chairman Mao of the Communist Party and eradicate the thousands of years of oppression and unfreedom suffered by Chinese women. We must not be fooled or compromised by any conspiracy or trick of US imperialism and the Nanjing reactionary regime.

　　Mr. Sha Qianli, Standing Committee Member of the Central Committee of the China National Salvation Association, spoke about his impressions after coming to the liberated area: First, all the oppressed and exploited people have turned over. Yesterday they were still cattle and horses, and today they have become true people and masters of the country. Second, the relationship between people has changed. The old society's fraud, hypocrisy, selfishness, and self-interest are being eliminated, and the goodness of human nature is being restored. These facts show that the material has turned over, and the spirit has also turned over with it. Third, everything in the liberated area is progressive and forward-looking. This is the result of the correct leadership of the CCP, coupled with the efforts of the entire people, and the complete destruction of the reactionary forces.

　　The famous revolutionary writer Mao Dun said: It is not surprising that the peace offensive of US imperialism and its godson Chiang Kai-shek is happening now. Because half a year ago, all parties pointed out that US imperialism would resort to this trick when Chiang Kai-shek's military collapse was irreversible. But what I find strange is why the US-Chiang knows that his trick will fail, why does he still want to make a fool of himself? It is very clear that their attempt is two-fold. On the one hand, they still want to deceive the relatively backward people in the Kuomintang-controlled areas. On the other hand, they want to paralyze the democratic figures who remain in the Kuomintang-controlled areas. In order to achieve a truly democratic peace, Chairman Mao has put forward eight conditions in his statement on the current situation, and no one does not express their firm support for it. Only the realization of these eight articles can China have a truly democratic peace. If these eight articles are not achieved, the People's Liberation Army should continue to fight all the way to Hainan Island.

　　Mr. Chen Qiyou, Chairman of the China Zhi Gong Party, denounced in his speech the Kuomintang reactionaries' deception, extortion, and devastation of overseas Chinese over the past 20 years. He said that the overseas Chinese hate the Chiang regime no less than the people in the country. They place great hope on the liberated areas and the democratic united government. After the establishment of a true democratic united government in the future, the overseas Chinese comrades will definitely be very happy to return to the country to serve and fulfill their responsibilities, such as returning to the country to invest, start businesses, and contribute technology.

　　Huang Zhensheng, representative of the All-China Students' Federation in the Kuomintang-controlled areas, said: The "peace" that the Kuomintang reactionary group is talking about now is very clear to deceive the people and prolong its dog life, so that it can wait for some time to slaughter the people again. Our Chinese students must never be fooled. Chinese students, with the excellent revolutionary tradition since the "May Fourth" Movement, have firmly struggled with the reactionaries in recent years. We understand that the ideals pursued by students in the Kuomintang-controlled areas have been fully realized in the liberated areas today. There can be no middle line and no opposition in the democratic camp. We cannot be lenient with the enemy. The thousands of dead classmates do not allow us to be lenient. The countless suffering classmates who are still in the Kuomintang concentration camps also do not allow us to be lenient. The blood of the dead classmates points the way for us. This road is to carry the revolution through to the end. This road is to thoroughly realize Chairman Mao's eight conditions and achieve true peace. This road is for all the people and all democratic parties in the country to unite and eliminate the reactionaries and establish a new China of people's democracy with the worker-peasant alliance as the main body.

　　The speech of the famous professor and member of the Central Committee of the China Democratic League, Mr. Deng Chumin, compared the difference between the liberated areas and the Kuomintang-controlled areas to heaven and hell. He said that the so-called middle-of-the-roaders are those who do not want to carry the revolution through to the end, do not want the entire Chinese people to turn over, and do not want the counter-revolutionary forces to be completely eliminated. These people are supporters of Chiang Kai-shek's peace offensive and also supporters of Li Zongren, Chiang Kai-shek's substitute. Mr. Deng continued to point out that the present is the decisive beginning of history, and vigilance should be heightened against these people. If the enemy cannot thoroughly implement Mr. Mao Zedong's eight propositions, there will be no true peace and they should be eliminated!

　　Mr. Wang Shao'ao, Standing Director of the China Association for Promoting Democracy, took the work of justice, education, trade union movement, and land reform as examples, praised the democratic style of the liberated areas, and the arduous struggle of the staff in the liberated areas. When talking about the current situation, he said: Chairman Mao's eight articles are the opinions of the Chinese people. And after the revolution is victorious throughout the country, we should also follow Chairman Mao's proposition to establish a joint dictatorship of all revolutionary classes and all democratic parties, and use a strong organization to defend the fruits of the revolution. No counter-revolutionary elements should participate in all revolutionary regimes.

　　Ms. Xu Guangping, representative of the Shanghai People's Organizations Federation, on behalf of the sixty-eight progressive people's organizations in Shanghai, and more than 400,000 people from all walks of life under its influence, denounced the Kuomintang's peace conspiracy and firmly advocated carrying the revolution through to the end. She said: Shanghai is about to be liberated. The people of Shanghai will definitely cooperate with the People's Liberation Army with resolute struggle to overthrow the reactionary Kuomintang rule. Liberate Shanghai, liberate all of China!

　　Mr. Xu Baoju, Standing Committee Member of the Central Committee of the Three People's Principles Comrades Association and Member of the Central Committee of the Revolutionary Committee of the Kuomintang, said: Now we are facing a new era, and workers, peasants, women, and all oppressed people have turned over. This is all due to the correct leadership of the CCP and Mr. Mao. This great achievement was exchanged for blood by the comrades of the CCP and the people of the whole country after more than 20 years of struggle. Comrades who advocate democratic revolution should wholeheartedly follow closely, cooperate with the CCP's line, and carry the revolution through to the end. First of all, we must recognize that US imperialism is the source of all evil and the source of all chaos, and the aggressive forces of US imperialism must be thoroughly purged. Secondly, we should recognize that the People's Liberation Army has won a decisive victory. If the Kuomintang reactionary government does not implement Mr. Mao's eight peace conditions, the People's Liberation Army must thoroughly purge the reactionary military forces and never allow it to revive. We must also recognize the conspiracies and tricks of US imperialism and never be fooled. We must carry the revolution through to the end and achieve a true and lasting peace.

　　The famous playwright Professor Hong Shen said: I have been engaged in drama activities for 30 years and am familiar with the tragic situation of the masses in the Kuomintang-controlled areas. My colleagues of more than 20 years, university professors, eat porridge all day long, and most of the film industry workers work 12 hours a day, only getting the equivalent of four cents before the Anti-Japanese War. The people in the Kuomintang-controlled areas want to end such a tragic life. They must persevere in their struggle and never fall into the trap of the reactionaries, accepting a sloppy peace, so that the reactionaries can sell their treacherous plans and harm the people again.

　　Ms. Cao Mengjun, Standing Committee Member of the Central Committee of the China National Salvation Association and Standing Director of the All-China Women's Federation, compared the lives of women in the liberated areas and the Kuomintang areas, and pointed out that only in the liberated areas under the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party have women truly turned over. At the same time, the women in the Kuomintang-controlled areas are also looking forward to the arrival of the People's Liberation Army. Because they understand that only with the arrival of the People's Liberation Army can they turn over. Today is the time when the national liberation is about to come, and it is also the time when the national women's liberation is about to be realized. The Kuomintang reactionaries launched a hypocritical peace offensive under the instigation of US imperialism, and the 235 million female compatriots across the country will definitely resolutely oppose it. Chinese women love peace, but the peace we want is a true democratic peace that realizes Chairman Mao's eight conditions, and it is by no means a hypocritical peace of the reactionaries.

　　Mr. Shi Fuliang, Standing Director of the Democratic National Construction Association, expressed his feelings on the current situation in a written speech, saying that the Kuomintang's rule for more than 20 years is not only against the CCP, but also against the workers, peasants, and the masses, and against all democratic parties, and even against all peace-loving people, and even against all patriotic intellectuals, petty bourgeoisie, and national bourgeoisie. The Kuomintang's rule is completely a bloody rule, a rule of warmongers and killers. The total number of people who died directly or indirectly under this rule is in the tens of millions. For more than 20 years, it has never brought us peace. Even temporary local peace is only a peace that enslaves the people and protects the privileges of a minority. Therefore, the fundamental issue at present is not whether there is peace in form, but what the content or essence of peace is. To be honest, the peace that the Chinese people desire is the peace of being masters, not the peace of being slaves. The eight peace conditions put forward by CCP leader Mr. Mao Zedong precisely represent the interests and demands of the people of the whole country. All people who desire peace and all people who do not want to be slaves again can only firmly support the CCP and strive for the thorough realization of these conditions.

　　Mr. Sun Qimeng, Standing Director of the Democratic National Construction Association and educator, said in a written speech: Seeing the rapid progress of the construction undertakings in the liberated areas, especially the education undertakings, I am even more convinced that there must be a thorough revolution and the premise of the people being the masters before education can have a foundation for development. The Chinese revolution is now approaching the completion of its great cause, which means that the foundation of the new education has been laid for the most part, and it must not be allowed to destroy or stop this foundation. I dare to believe that all Chinese educators are willing to raise their hands and agree with the eight peace conditions put forward by CCP Chairman Mao. Talking about peace without any of these eight conditions is deception. I hope that friends in the education circles across the country will publicize these eight conditions, strive for the realization of these eight conditions, expose the enemy's conspiracies, and realize true democratic peace.

　　The welcome meeting ended with a speech by Comrade Li Fuchun, representative of the Northeast Central Bureau of the CCP. He said: Today's welcome meeting symbolizes the great unity of China's democratic forces, and also symbolizes the imminent arrival of national victory. The propositions of all the gentlemen on the current situation prove that the people of the whole country, all democratic parties, and people's organizations need true and lasting peace, not hypocritical and reactionary peace, and prove that the statement of Chairman Mao of the Central Committee of the CCP on the current situation represents the will of the people of the whole country and is also the position of the famous statement of all the gentlemen on January 22. After denouncing the false peace conspiracy of the Kuomintang reactionaries, he pointed out that as long as the people of the whole country, all democratic parties, have a consistent understanding, a consistent pace, and a united unity, so that the enemy has no chance to take advantage of, we will definitely be able to strive for a true, democratic, and lasting peace. Comrade Li Fuchun said at the end of his speech: We warmly hope that all the gentlemen will, in the spirit of knowing everything and saying everything, criticize the shortcomings of the work in the liberated areas. We need this kind of criticism to improve our common cause. At this point, the meeting closed in an atmosphere of warm unity.
(End)

　　各民主人士在东北欢迎会上演说
  　痛斥南京伪政府假和平阴谋
    主张在中共领导下把革命进行到底
    【新华社沈阳三十一日电】此间中共东北中央局，东北政务委员会，人民解放军东北军区以及东北各界人民代表，于本月二十六日举行盛大的欢迎会，热烈欢迎为参加新政协会议而先后到达东北解放区之全国各民主党派，各人民团体，以及无党无派的民主人士。出席这次欢迎大会的计有：李济深、沈钧儒、马叙伦、郭沫若、谭平山、彭泽民、章伯钧、蔡廷锴、章乃器、李德全、沙千里、茅盾、朱学范、陈其尤、黄振声、朱蕴山、邓初民、王绍鏊、许广平、丘哲、冯裕芳、许宝驹、洪琛、侯外庐、曹孟君、施复亮、孙起孟、李民欣、梅龚彬、沈志远、吴茂荪、林一元、赖亚力、孔德＠等共三十四人。大会于下午二时开始。首由东北行政委员会主席林枫致欢迎词。他首先代表中共东北中央局、东北政委会、东北军区及东北各界同胞，向长期在国民党统治区为民主事业而艰苦奋斗的全国各民主党派各人民团体及无党无派的民主人士表示热烈的欢迎。接着李济深、沈钧儒、马叙伦、郭沫若等二十人相继在会上发表演说，一致痛斥南京国民党的假和平阴谋，拥护中共中央毛泽东主席对时局的声明，主张在中国共产党的领导之下把革命进行到底。
    中国国民党革命委员会主席李济深先生在演说中首先谈到他对中国共产党的看法，认为中国人民民主革命的所以有今天这样伟大的成就，乃由于中共领导正确，措施洽当，真正符合了全国人民大众的需要。其次说到他对解放区的观感。他说：看到一般平民真正享受了民主自由的幸福，生产建设突飞猛进，特别是动员人民的力量有了最大的成功，以及中共党员领导人民工作的艰苦努力和解放军的无比英勇，令人钦佩不已。李济深先生在谈到美蒋和平攻势时说：正当中国人民民主革命接近全面胜利时，蒋介石忽然发表元旦广播，作出求和姿态，但同时却要保持其伪宪法与伪法统，并要与“共产党周旋到底”。三星期后，他又逃之夭夭了。看他“引退”以前的种种布置，可以证明他还想在幕后指挥一切。从南京反动政权各色各样的活动看来，国民党的和平攻势，可以断言完全是美帝国主义所策动的一个大骗局，企图利用和平的美名来保持他们封建残余的力量，阻碍中国革命的彻底成功。中共主席毛泽东先生一月十四日发表的严正声明，揭斥了美蒋反动虚伪的和平阴谋，并提出真正的民主的八个和平条件。这八个条件可以说完全能代表各革命的民主党派，民主团体，民主人士，以至全国人民的一致公意。南京反动政权惟有接受这八个条件，真正的民主的和平才能实现，全国人民也惟有促进实现这八个条件，真正的民主和平才能保障。希望全国人民一致起来反对假和平，争取真和平。
    中国民主同盟中央常务委员沈钧儒先生讲话称：进入解放区后看到了真正人民的民主自由。在这里，没有帝国主义的侵略势力，没有四大家族，没有封建地主军阀官僚。这里有的是翻了身的人民，做了国家主人的工农劳动人民。来到东北解放区短时内的所见所闻，已充分证明了解放了的人民的创造力量是伟大得可惊的。解放军挺进到哪里，哪里的人民就组织起来支援前线，在工厂中工人自觉的改进生产方法提高生产效率，农村中解放了的农民自动交公粮，争先参加担架队，这些在我们走过的地方都亲眼看见的。这是件翻天覆地的历史上的大转变，把帝国主义封建势力官僚资本的反动统治送到坟墓中去了。我们不能忘记，被压迫人民之所以能造成这空前的历史大转变，是因为有了伟大的中国共产党和英明领袖毛泽东先生的领导，我们不能不向伟大的中共和毛泽东先生致最崇高的敬意。从济南、全东北解放至淮海、平津大捷，解放军已歼敌百余万，从而使罪恶滔天的南京反动统治，真正到了土崩瓦解的时候。天字第一号的杀人刽子手蒋介石居然也唱起和平的调子来了。三年前他破坏政协决议，不顾全国人民的反对，悍然发动了反共反人民的大内战，这些也都是为了“和平”？这个“和平”，就是为了保存他四大家族的反动统治，这是大家都明白的。然而毕竟蒋介石这个大刽子手大战争罪犯的话太引不起人民的注意，于是便依照早安排好的阴谋“引退”到幕后，而让李宗仁、孙科等另一批反动头子摆到台前来。最近在广播消息中知道李宗仁有信给民盟几个人，还提到我的名字。大家知道，李宗仁不也是个战犯吗？他们的宪法、法统，民盟早已根本否认，我们与他们谈什么好呢？人民是不会和李宗仁、孙科这些战犯们来谈和平的，他们应当受到人民的惩办。如果真要谈判，也要首先无条件的接受并实行毛泽东先生的八项和平条件，这是最低限度的先决条件，缺少一个是绝对不行的。假如即将被人民摧毁的反动政权，想借和平谈判来缓和革命进攻，分散革命阵营的团结，以图保存其残余的反动力量，那我们全国人民必以加倍的力量，来粉碎这种阴谋诡计。同时，我要向大家报告一件事，就是中国民主同盟中央总部，不久前已决议迁入解放区，不久即将完成迁移工作。我们将继续与其他民主党派巩固团结，为全部彻底干净消灭帝国主义、封建势力、官僚资本对于中国人民的反动统治，完成人民民主革命而奋斗。
    中国民主促进会常务理事马叙伦先生讲话，他强调只有彻底打倒帝国主义、封建势力与官僚资本主义，才能建立民主自由和平统一的新中国。几十年来中国革命进行不彻底，即因帝国主义控制了国内的封建独裁政权，并产生了官僚资本，人民在遭受重重压榨剥削下，陷入了苦难的深坑，根本谈不到享受什么自由民主。国民党反动集团虽然天天在那里诬蔑解放区和共产党，但只有在共产党领导下的解放区，才能实现真正的自由和民主。此次来解放区经亲闻目睹更加证实了这一点。关于和谈问题，马叙伦先生说，我们所争取的是真正的和平而不是马马虎虎妥协的和平，因此必须彻底打倒帝国主义、封建势力与官僚资本主义等革命对象，绝不是单纯蒋介石一个人“引退”的问题。国民党反动政府只有全部接受毛主席的八项条件，才能实现真正的和平，为了加速革命的胜利，前方应加紧作战，勇猛前进，后方应加紧生产，努力支援前线。
    著名的革命文学家和历史学家郭沫若先生说，目前美蒋企图以和平阴谋掩护其军事挣扎。在蒋介石溜出南京后，放下一个李宗仁作后卫，让自己好争取时间，苟延残喘。李宗仁今天留在南京，正在拚命执行美蒋使命，进行和平攻势，公然把他虚伪的和平触角伸进了我们的民主阵营来。他在给李任潮先生的公开的电文里，竟大言不惭地要我们“北方的和平民主人士”到南京去与他讲和，他真不知天高地厚。李宗仁身居头等战犯，其罪恶实不亚于蒋介石。如果蒋介石溜走了，就应该找李宗仁算帐，要他清还中国人民的血债。郭沫若先生说：为要实现真正民主的和平，我的意见就是以毛泽东主席的意见为意见，毛先生是把人民的公意反映得最正确、最集中、最完整、最迅速的伟大人民领袖。毛先生本月十四日时局声明中所提的八条，完全反映了中国人民的公意。全中国的民主党派人民团体民主人士，也都一心一意地甘愿在毛泽东的领导下，在无产阶级先锋队中国共产党的领导下，团结一致，就象一个整体，决心为实现人民的公意，争取真正的和平而彻底奋斗。
    白发苍苍的三民主义同志联合会主任委员谭平山先生，在讲话中阐述了必须把革命进行到底，并在这一问题上着重说明了辛亥革命时的惨痛的经验教训。他说：辛亥革命固然有成功的地方，但失败的教训更须记取。他认为辛亥革命当时主要的失败有四：首先，也是最大的失败，是对各种反革命势力特别是对袁世凯的中途妥协。第二，是革命阵营中的不纯，包括了反动的破坏分子，破坏了革命的统一战线，削弱了革命的有生力量。第三，出现了中间路线，如当时的宋教仁即认为在建国时期不应再采取革命手段，而主张议会斗争，结果他自己也死在袁世凯手里。第四，没有坚决保存和掌握自己的革命武装，使革命果实失去了保障。至此，谭先生说：这些历史上的教训，今天中国人民再不会重复了。目前的中国革命，在中国共产党的领导下面，一定可以彻底地走向胜利。
    民主同盟南方总支部主席彭泽民先生讲话称：只有在中国共产党毛泽东先生的正确领导下，中国人民才能翻身。中国才能得到真正的民主独立和平。南京反动集团，完全是美帝国主义侵略中国的工具。现在它看到人民革命力量已经不能遏止，就示意蒋介石“引退”，并呼吁“和平”，企图迷惑人民，保存残余的反动势力。如果反动派不执行毛先生的八项和平条件，我们就要急起穷追，不让他们有一刻喘息机会。我们只有走彻底革命的道路，不能有第二条道路，更不容许有反对派。大家团结起来，粉碎美帝国主义阴谋，戳穿和平诡计，达到完全胜利，建立民主独立富强的新中国。
    中国农工民主党主席中国民主同盟中央常务委员章伯钧先生发表了三个意见，第一，他认为今天的欢迎大会说明全国各党派民主人士，在中共领导下团结一致，具有重大的历史意义。这个团结，表示在中共领导下的民主力量无比伟大，和蒋美对于解放区的造谣诬蔑的可耻的破产。有了中共的领导及各党派的合作，中国将迅速建设成为一富强的国家，使帝国主义对中国不敢有任何妄想。第二，即将召开的政协会议是在共产党领导之下没有反动分子参加的革命的政协会议，基本精神与本质和旧政协不同，对于召开这个会议我们是很乐观的。第三，现在有人主张在民主阵营中搞反对派，提出这种谬论的人，不是神经病患者，便是受了美国老板的雇佣，或是受了英美课本的欺骗影响，民主党派人士显然地不应有此种观点，也不许可参加此种路线。最后，章伯钧先生声明：李宗仁给民盟电报中有我的名字，他是头等战争罪犯，已没有资格和我们谈和平问题，因而也没有答他的必要。
    中国国民党民主促进会负责人蔡廷锴先生在讲话中回溯中国历次革命之所以失败，皆由于革命不够彻底，以致直至今日除解放军外，各地人民仍在水深火热中。人民所受的痛苦都是美帝国主义及其走狗以蒋介石为首的南京反动政权所造成的。谈及目前时局，他说：蒋介石李宗仁孙科和他们的主子美帝国主义，眼看着他们的统治快要完全崩溃了，乃先后哀鸣求和，蒋介石又宣布所谓“引退”，这些都是阴谋，企图以此欺骗人民，苟延残喘，我们决不能受骗。我们需要和平，但我们需要的是把美帝驱逐出中国，铲除封建残余，没收官僚资本，人民得到真正自由民主的永久和平。蔡廷锴先生说：毛泽东先生对时局声明的八项和平条件，是达到真正永久民主和平的基本条件，也正是全国人民所要求的和平条件。各民主党派应该紧密地团结合作，为实现这些条件，为求永久和平，建立新民主主义的新中国而奋斗到底。
    民主建国会常务理事章乃器先生的讲话盛赞了解放区的各种建设。他说，解放区人民的伟大力量是我过去所意想不到的。这是一个真正的人民的社会，在中国历史上从来找不到解放区这样光明的时代。接着谈到目前时局，他说：现在国民党军事上已经完全崩溃了，他们企图以软的办法、和平的阴谋来阻止革命，使革命半途而废。革命战争就好象是一幅很大的图画，如果只画了一半而停止，怎么可以呢？同样地，中国这一半解放了，那一半却得不到解放，不仅解放区的人民不肯，就是蒋管区二亿以上生活在水深火热之中的人民也不会允许的。
    中国妇女联谊会主席李德全先生说：中国妇女受了几千年的压迫，今天在共产党毛主席领导下，才有了好日子。前两天召开的东北妇女代表大会，充分表现了妇女是翻了身。女工成了工厂主人。一百多农村妇女代表，有好多都是劳动英雄，她们参加了土地改革，得到了一份土地，政府还给她们发了地照。这是中国历史上从未有过的事。这些事实告诉我们，一定要在毛主席共产党领导下，为真正自由独立民主的国家服务，把中国妇女几千年受压迫不自由铲除掉。美帝国主义及南京反动政权无论用什么阴谋鬼计，我们都不能上当，不能妥协。
    中国人民救国会中央常务委员沙千里先生讲他来解放区后的观感：第一，一切被压迫被剥削的人们都翻了身，昨天还是牛、马，今天成了真正的人、国家的主人翁。第二，人与人之间的关系改变了，旧社会的欺诈虚伪自私自利在淘汰，人类善良的本性在恢复。这些事实，说明物质翻了身，精神也跟着翻了身。第三，解放区的一切都是进步的，向前的，这是在中共正确领导下，加上全体人民的努力，彻底摧毁反动势力的结果。
    著名的革命文学家茅盾先生说：美帝国主义及其干儿子蒋介石的和平攻势，在现在发生并不奇怪。因为半年以前，各方已指出美帝国主义在蒋介石的军事崩溃不可挽回时，就会来这一套。但是令我引为奇怪的，就是美蒋明知他的把戏会失败，为什么还要献丑呢？很明白的，他们的企图是两方面的，一方面是还想欺骗国民党统治区比较落后的人民，一方面是想麻痹留在国民党统治区的民主人士。为了实现真正民主的和平，毛主席在时局声明中已提出了八项条件，没一个人不表示坚决拥护它。只有这八条的实现，中国才有真正民主的和平。如果达不到这八条，解放军就应该一直打到海南岛为止。
    中国致公党主席陈其尤先生，在讲话中痛斥了国民党反动派二十余年来对侨胞的欺骗敲诈和摧残的情形。他说，华侨对蒋政权的痛恨不下于国内人民。而对解放区，对民主的联合政府却寄予极大的希望。将来真正的民主联合政府成立之后，华侨同志，必然会很高兴地回国效力，尽他们自己的责任，例如回国投资，创办实业，贡献技术等。
    国民党统治区全国学生联合会代表黄振声说：现在国民党反动集团谈的“和平”，很明白是为了欺骗人民延长它的狗命，以便等些时候，再来屠杀人民，我们中国学生绝不能上当。有着“五四”以来优秀革命传统的中国学生，几年来坚决地和反动派作斗争。我们了解在国民党统治区的学生所追求的理想，今天在解放区完全实现了。在民主阵营中不能有中间路线，不能有反对派。我们对敌人不能随便宽大。千百死难的同学，不准许我们随便宽大。今天还在国民党集中营中的无数受难同学亦不许我们随便宽大。死难同学的血，指明着我们的道路。这条路，就是把革命进行到底。这条路，就是彻底实现毛主席的八项条件取得真正的和平。这条路，就是全国人民各民主党派团结一致，消灭反动派，建立以工农联盟为主体的人民民主的新中国。
    名教授中国民主同盟中央委员邓初民先生的讲话，把解放区和国民党统治区的差别比成为天堂和地狱。他说，所谓中间派的人们，就是不希望把革命进行到底，不要中国人民整个翻身，也不希望反革命力量完全消灭。这些人是蒋介石和平攻势的拥护者，也是蒋介石替身——李宗仁的支持者。邓先生继指出目前是历史的决定开头，应当对这些人提高警惕。如果敌人不能彻底实行毛泽东先生的八项主张，就没有真正的和平，就应当予以消灭！
    中国民主促进会的常务理事王绍鏊先生以司法、教育、职工运动及土地改革工作为例，盛赞解放区的民主作风，以及解放区工作人员的艰苦奋斗精神。谈及时局问题时，他说：毛主席的八条就是中国人民的意见。而当革命在全国胜利后，还应遵照毛主席的主张，建立各革命阶级各民主党派的联合专政，以强力的机构，保卫革命果实，所有革命政权中，不要有一个反革命分子参加。
    上海人民团体联合会代表许广平先生，代表上海六十八个进步的人民团体，以及在其影响下的四十万以上的各业人民，痛斥了国民党的和平阴谋，坚决主张要把革命进行到底。他说：上海快要解放了，上海人民必定用坚决的斗争配合人民解放军，打倒反动的国民党统治。解放大上海，解放全中国！
    三民主义同志会中央常务委员、国民党革命委员会中央委员许宝驹先生说：现在我们面临着一个新时代，工人、农民、妇女及一切被压迫人民翻了身。这都是由于中共及毛先生的领导正确。这个伟大成就，是中共同志们与全国人民二十几年奋斗用血换来的。主张民主革命的同志，应一心一德紧紧追随，配合中共路线，把革命进行到底。首先要认识美帝国主义是万恶之首，万乱之源，必须把美帝国主义侵略势力彻底肃清。其次应认识人民解放军已获得决定胜利，国民党反动政府如不执行毛先生八项和平条件，人民解放军一定要彻底肃清反动军事力量，绝不容许它死灰复燃。我们更要认识美帝的阴谋鬼计，决不要上当。我们必须把革命进行到底，实现真正的永久的和平。
    名戏剧家洪深教授说：我从事戏剧活动达三十年，熟悉国民党统治区的群众生活的悲惨状况。我的二十多年的同事们，大学教授们，成天吃稀饭，大多数电影界工作人员一天做十二小时的工作，只获得合抗战前四角钱的报酬。国民党统治区人民要结束如此悲惨的生活，只有坚持奋斗，绝不能误入反动派的圈套，接受一个马马虎虎的和平，使反动派得售奸计，再害人民。
    中国人民救国会中央常务委员、中国妇女联谊会常务理事曹孟君先生，对比了解放区与国民党区妇女的生活，指出只有在中国共产党领导下的解放区，妇女才真正翻了身。同时，国民党统治区的妇女，也正渴望着解放军的到来。因为她们明白，只有解放军的到来，她们才能翻身。今天正是全国解放即将到来的时候，也是全国妇女解放即将实现的时候。国民党反动派在美帝国主义策动下发动了虚伪的和平攻势，全国二万三千五百万妇女同胞必定坚决反对。中国妇女是爱和平的，但是我们所要的和平是实现毛主席八个条件真正的民主的和平，而决不是反动派虚伪的和平。
    民主建国会常务理事施复亮先生，在书面的谈话中，发表对目前时局的感想称：国民党二十多年的统治，不仅以中共为敌，以工农大众为敌，而且与一切民主党派为敌，甚至与一切爱好和平的人民为敌，甚至与一切爱国的知识分子、小资产阶级和民族资产阶级为敌。国民党的统治，完全是血腥的统治，是好战和好杀者的统治，直接间接死在这种统治之下的人民总在数千万以上。二十多年来，它从来不曾带给我们以和平。就是一时局部的和平，也只是一种奴役人民的和平，保护少数人特权的和平。所以目前的根本问题，不在于形式上有无和平，而在于和平的内容或实质如何。老实说：中国人民所希求的和平，是作主人的和平，而不是做奴隶的和平。中共领袖毛先生所提出的八项和平条件，正是代表了全国人民的利益和要求，一切渴望和平的人民，一切不愿再做奴隶的人民，都只有坚决支持中共，努力争取这些条件的彻底实现。
    民主建国会常务理事教育家孙起孟先生，在书面谈话中说道：看到解放区建设事业特别是教育事业的突飞猛进，我就越发相信，必须有彻底的革命，人民做主的前提，教育才有发展的基础。中国革命现已临近大功告成，也就是新教育的基础已经打好了大部分，断不容许把这个基础破坏，或停歇下来。我敢相信，所有的中国教育工作者，都愿意高举双手，赞成中共毛主席所提出的八个和平条件。离开了这八个条件的任何一个来谈和平就是欺骗。希望全国教育界的朋友们宣传这八个条件，争取这八个条件的实现，揭穿敌人的阴谋，实现真正的民主和平。
    欢迎大会，由中共东北中央局代表李富春同志的讲话而结束。他说：今天的欢迎会，象征着中国民主力量的大团结，也象征着全国胜利的快要到来。诸位先生对时局的主张，证明了全国人民，各民主党派，人民团体需要真正的永久的和平，而不要虚伪的反动的和平，证明了中共中央毛主席对时局的声明，是代表着全国人民的意志，也是诸位先生一月二十二日的著名声明的立场。他在痛斥了国民党反动派的假和平阴谋之后，指出：只要全国人民，全国各民主党派认识一致，步调一致，团结一致，使敌人无隙可乘，我们就一定能争取真正的民主的永久的和平。李富春同志在结束讲话时说：热烈地希望诸位先生本着知无不言言无不尽的精神，批评解放区工作的缺点，我们需要这种批评，借以改进我们的共同事业。大会至此，即在热烈团结的空气中闭幕。
