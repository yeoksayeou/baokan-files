　　Attention to Preventing Livestock Diseases
    Comrade Editor: Recently, many livestock in our village have become sick. In five days, one mule and two donkeys have died, and many are being treated. The symptoms are all feverish, and the dead livestock all had jaundice, swollen intestines, rotten lungs, etc. This kind of loss is very harmful to the production of the masses, and all localities should pay attention to prevention.
    I am a veterinarian, and I have cured many of these illnesses. (Early treatment can cure it, but it will die if it is too late.) The reason for this disease is mainly that the weather was very dry and warm last winter and this spring, and the germs were not frozen to death. Once the spring breeze blows, the germs spread, leading to infection. In order to avoid or reduce this loss, I will list the prevention and treatment methods below for your reference.
    Prevention methods: 1. Feed livestock on time. 2. Feed more water-soaked mung beans and rice water. 3. Sprinkle lime in the pen. 4. Do not reuse leftover fodder. 5. Do not feed raw materials if illness is discovered after returning from work and before feeding again. 6. Release blood from the hind legs or chest in spring. Early administration of Spring Jaundice Elimination Powder (Six mace of Rhubarb, five mace of Glauber's salt, four mace of Aurantii Fructus, four mace of Gardenia, four mace of Scutellariae Radix, four mace of Bletilla Rhizome, four mace of Anemarrhena Rhizome, three mace of Fritillariae Thunbergii Bulbus, four mace of Scutellaria baicalensis, four mace of Turmeric, four mace of Coptis chinensis, four mace of Artemisia capillaris, four mace of Akebia trifoliata, six mace of Licorice, two taels of honey, and six eggs, all ground into powder and administered (two or three doses), reduce the dose by half for small livestock).
    Treatment methods for already sick animals are listed below: Eight-Character Jaundice: Add three mace each of Platycodonis Radix and Ophiopogon japonicus to the above formula. Rough Mouth Jaundice: Remove Rhubarb from the above formula and add four mace each of Platycodonis Radix, Angelica sinensis, Trichosanthis Radix, and Scrophulariae Radix. Release blood and avoid feeding raw materials after administration.

　　注意防止牲畜病
    编者同志：近日我村牲口发生病患者甚多，五天内已死掉一头骡子、二头驴，还有很多病的正在医治。病症都是热症，死的牲口都是黄症，肠子肿，肺烂等。这种损失，对群众生产大有妨害，各地都应注意防止。
    我是一个兽医，在这些病患中，也治好不少。（早治能治好，晚了就要死）。这种病的原因，主要是去冬今春天气非常干燥温暖，病菌未被冻死，一过春风，病菌飞扬，以至传染。要想避免或减少这一损失，今将防御与治法列下，以供参考。
    防御办法：一、按时饮喂牲畜。二、多喂水浸绿豆、饮米水。三、圈内要用石灰洒一洒。四、剩草料不可再用。五、劳动回来后没等再喂，发现病时忌喂生料。六、春季放大血或胸膛血。早灌春季消黄散（川大黄六钱、朴硝五钱、连壳四钱、枝子四钱、黄子四钱、白药子四钱、知母四钱、贝母三钱、黄芩四钱、玉金四钱、川黄连四钱、茵陈四钱、木通四钱、甘草六钱、蜂蜜二两、鸡子六个，共为末灌（二服或三服）小牲口减半）。
    如已病治法列下：八字黄：上方加桔梗、寸冬各三钱。曹口黄：上方去川大黄，加桔梗、当归、天花粉、元参各四钱。放大血，灌后忌喂生料。
