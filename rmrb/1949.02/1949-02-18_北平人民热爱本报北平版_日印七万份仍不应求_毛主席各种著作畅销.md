Xinhua News Agency, Beiping, 16th -- Special correspondent Alan Winnington reports: Newspaper vendors here find it difficult to keep up with the public demand for the Communist Party newspaper "People's Daily." The official price of the newspaper is two yuan, but eager readers are even willing to pay fifty yuan to buy a copy. This newspaper is printed at the printing plant of the Kuomintang's North China Daily -- the North China Daily has always been the largest Kuomintang newspaper in North China, with a circulation of 8,000 copies. Now its machines are printing 70,000 copies of the "People's Daily" every day, and these newspapers are immediately sold out in the city and suburbs. To meet the need, an additional 30,000 to 40,000 copies would have to be printed, but this extra number cannot be printed until more paper can be procured. There is always fierce competition to get a batch of newspapers when they are published every morning. At first, there was even fighting for them, but now the newspaper staff has helped the newsboys organize themselves, and the phenomenon of disputes is less common. The public is so concerned about accurate news at home and abroad that some newsboys cycle in from as far as twenty miles away, finding it profitable to make such a trip. A group of newsboys have even organized themselves to take turns selling newspapers from Baoding, which is more than a hundred miles away; when one person rides back with the newspapers, another is already on his way to Beiping. Of course, these newspapers are sold to regular subscribers at the prescribed price, and only the remainder are given to the newsboys. Workers, students, and the broad masses of the working people of Beiping are enthusiastically reading this newspaper, which is simply their own newspaper. Articles about factory and student activities are published every day, many of which are works by workers, students, and progressive professors. The People's Daily has captured and reflected the vigorous spirit of the newly liberated Beiping, the enthusiasm of the working class, and the thirst for knowledge that has been suppressed by the Kuomintang for so long.

This desire to understand things is also reflected in the Xinhua Bookstore, which opened here four days ago. Every morning, a crowd starts to form at 7:30 am, waiting for the bookstore to open at 9:00 am. The best-selling book is Mao Zedong's "On New Democracy," followed closely by "On Coalition Government." The bookstore is crowded all day long, and many people who cannot afford to buy them for the time being read these books carefully for hours. Although the staff of the newspaper office and bookstore are desperately trying to increase their supply, it will take a long time to be able to meet the demand.

　　北平人民热爱本报北平版
  　日印七万份仍不应求
    毛主席各种著作畅销
    【新华社北平十六日电】本社特派员阿兰·魏宁顿报导：此间报贩觉得难以赶上社会公众对共产党报纸“人民日报”的需求。该报正式订价是二元，但热切的读者甚至不惜以五十块钱去争买一份。这一报纸是在国民党机关报华北日报的印刷厂排印的，——华北日报一向是华北最大的国民党报纸，发行额为八千份。现在它的机器正在印刷着每天七万份的“人民日报”，这些报纸在城内和近郊立即销售尽净。要满足需要还得额外再印三四万份，但在能运动更多印报纸之前，这额外的份数就不可能印刷。每天早上报纸出版时，为了取得一批报纸，总要有一番激烈的竞争。当初，甚至还有为这打架的，但现在报社人员帮助报童组织起来，争执的现象就少见了。社会公众对于国内外的确实消息是这样关心，以至于有些报童远自二十哩外骑自行车前来，发觉这样跑一趟还有利可得。有一组报童甚而组织起来，从远在百哩以外的保定到这里来轮番贩报，当这一个人骑自行车带着报纸回去的时候，另一个人便已在赴北平的途中了。当然，这些报纸是按规定的价格卖给正规订户的，只有剩下的才给报童。工人、学生和北平的广大劳动人民都热烈地阅读这一份报，它对于他们来说，简直是他们自己的报纸。每天都刊发着关于工厂和学生活动的文章，其中许多是工人、学生和进步教授的作品，人民日报抓住了而且反映出新解放的北平的蓬勃精神，工人阶级的热情，以及被国民党压制了这样久的求知欲。
    这种渴想了解事情的心情，也表现在四天前在此间开办的新华书店。每天早上七点半钟就开始形成一列人群，等待着九点钟书店开门。最畅销的书是毛泽东的“新民主主义论”，其次“论联合政府”，销路也跟前者差不多。书店里整天都是拥挤的，有许多人一时还买不起，便好几个小时地细读这些书。虽然报馆和书店的职员都在拼命地设法增加他们的供应，但要做到能够应付需要，还得一个长时间。
