　　Xinhua News Agency, East China, 11th: People from all walks of life in East China held a celebration rally for the liberation of Beiping at a certain location at 1:00 PM on the 4th. Attendees included representatives from directly affiliated organizations of the East China Bureau of the CPC Central Committee, the East China Military Region, and the Shandong Provincial People's Government, as well as representatives from workers, peasants, youth, women, and other people's organizations and democratic figures from the newly liberated areas, totaling over a thousand people. After the chairman delivered a speech at the beginning of the rally, Rao Shushi, political commissar of the East China Military Region, spoke first. After pointing out the significance of the liberation of Tianjin and Beiping and the truth about the Kuomintang's false peace plot, Commissar Rao said: We firmly support Chairman Mao's statement on the current situation on January 14th. We welcome the opinions of Mr. Li Jishen, Shen Junru, Ma Xulun, Guo Moruo, and 51 other gentlemen on the current situation on January 22nd. The entire military and civilians of East China will definitely follow Chairman Mao's instructions: before the reactionary government of the Kuomintang in Nanjing accepts and implements genuine democratic peace, we must not slacken our combat efforts in the slightest degree, and we must resolutely, thoroughly, cleanly, and completely annihilate any reactionaries who dare to resist. After Zhang Fulin, chairman of the Shandong Federation of Trade Unions, Qing Zhiping, a representative of the Farmers' Association, Wang Ruilin, who attended the World Labor Youth Congress, combat model Shi Yuebo, and Liu Minsheng, vice chairman of the Shandong Provincial Assembly, spoke successively, several democratic figures who had newly arrived in the liberated areas from afar spoke to warm applause. Mr. Yang Kehuang, director of the Taiwan Democratic Self-Government League, filled his speech with the anger of the Taiwan compatriots resisting Japanese and American imperialism and its running dog Chiang Kai-shek. Mr. Gong Taoyi, manager of the Philippine Chinese Overseas Chinese Herald, introduced the situation of the Philippine people and more than 100,000 overseas Chinese in the Philippines, saying that they have organized themselves in the political and military struggle against imperialism. Professor Xia Kangnong, formerly of the Sino-French University in Beiping, explained that he was dismissed for signing a petition advocating domestic peace at the end of the Anti-Japanese War. But today, when the People's Liberation Army is about to liberate all of China, the Kuomintang reactionaries are coming for peace. This kind of false peace cannot deceive any Chinese. Mr. Lu Yudao of the China Lixue Society said that it was impossible to carry out academic research work in the Kuomintang-controlled areas, and only in the liberated areas today is there a new way out. The congress concluded after passing a telegram to Chairman Mao of the CPC Central Committee and to democratic parties, democratic figures, and people's organizations across the country.
    Xinhua News Agency, Shaanxi Central Front, 10th: The military and civilians in the garrison of the Northwest Front Field Army Headquarters jointly held a celebration meeting on the 1st to celebrate the liberation of Tianjin and Beiping, and telegraphed the whole country in support of the eight peace conditions proposed by Chairman Mao. General Zhao Shoushan, deputy commander of the Field Army, delivered a speech at the meeting. He first congratulated the people of central Shaanxi on their liberation and on spending the Spring Festival for the first time in joy. He then pointed out: The Kuomintang bandit gang is like a dying mad dog. Although it is now putting on a begging appearance, we must not be fooled by it and give it a chance to breathe, or it will turn around and bite us again. Only by fully realizing Chairman Mao's eight conditions can China have true peace. Gan Siqi, director of the Political Department, explained the significance of the liberation of Tianjin and Beiping and the great victories of the People's Liberation Army on various battlefields, and called on the entire army to strengthen military and policy study, prepare for entering the city, and strive for the liberation of the great northwest, the liberation of all of China, and the realization of true democratic peace. Local people's representatives Guo Guitang, Wang Jicheng and others made a clear comparison between the life of cattle and horses before liberation and the happy days after liberation, and expressed their willingness to work hard to support the People's Liberation Army and completely eliminate the Kuomintang reactionary labor force, so that they would not oppress the people again. At the end of the meeting, a telegram was passed to the whole country, enumerating the Kuomintang's heinous crimes of violating the people's will and launching a civil war, exposing the US imperialists' trick of directing the Kuomintang reactionaries to play the trick of false peace, and finally expressing the firm implementation of Chairman Mao Zedong's statement of the CPC, "Before the reactionary government of the Kuomintang in Nanjing has fully accepted and implemented the eight peace conditions, we will never relax our combat efforts, and we will resolutely, thoroughly, cleanly and completely eliminate any reactionaries who dare to resist."
    Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 11th: Various liberated areas celebrate the liberation of Tianjin and Beiping. Following the victory celebration rally of more than 60,000 people held in Shijiazhuang on the 1st of this month, more than 30,000 people in Luoyang also held a grand celebration meeting on the 2nd, and farmers from 20 miles away also rushed to participate with dry food. After the meeting, dragon lanterns, land boats, stilts, and other performances appeared on the streets of the city. Baoding and Zhangjiakou also held meetings to celebrate. Baoding also held a torch parade.
