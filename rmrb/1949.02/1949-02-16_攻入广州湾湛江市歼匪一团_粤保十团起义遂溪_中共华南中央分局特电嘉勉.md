The day after Chen's troops revolted, they issued a circular telegram stating: They are determined to break away from the Kuomintang reactionary government and, under the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party, fight to the end for the people's liberation cause in order to atone for their past mistakes. The unit has now entered the Guangdong-Guangxi border area liberated area for rest and reorganization.
