　　Soviet Rural Life
    △ The "Red Army" State-owned Beet Farm in Voronezh Oblast, Russian Republic, has been a model of a modern socialist farm for nearly twenty years. The farm occupies almost eight thousand hectares (approximately 120,000+ Chinese acres), of which six thousand hectares are cultivated. This farm mainly produces sugar beets, but also grows grain and vegetables, and raises various livestock and poultry. Agricultural workers here use forty-five tractors, ten combine harvesters, four compound threshers, four beet harvesters, and sixteen cargo trucks for farming. Airplanes are also used to fertilize the farm. The vast livestock farm is also equipped with electric milking machines, automatic grass cutters, and conveyor belts for feeding. The dormitories for workers and staff on this state farm are constantly being expanded. In their spare time, workers go to clubs, cinemas, and libraries to participate in cultural and recreational activities, which has become a part of their daily life. There are a large number of enterprises similar to the "Red Army" State-owned Beet Farm in the Soviet Union.
    △ In the Uzbek Republic, an elderly peasant woman named Maria. Teryonina, recently won the "Mother's Glory" medal awarded by the government. This brings the total number of government medals won by this family to sixty. Maria Teryonina's five sons, one daughter, and five grandchildren all participated in the war against Germany. Her son, Peter Teryonin, received the title of "Hero of the Soviet Union" for his bravery and heroism in crossing the Dnieper River. Other members of the family served as aviators, tank drivers, engineers, infantrymen, and nurses, and all received several combat medals. Two members of the family worked in state farms during the war, and they also received medals for their selfless labor. After the war, the entire Teryonina family resumed their peaceful efforts. Soviet hero Peter Teryonin worked at a state farm, and was awarded the honorary title of "Hero of Socialist Labor" for his contribution to the abundant harvest of grain.

　　苏联农村生活
    △俄罗斯共和国佛罗内兹州国营“红军”甜菜农庄，几乎在廿年以来一直是现代化的社会主义大农庄的模范。该农庄占地几达八千公顷（约合十二万余华亩），其中在耕种的有六千公顷。这个农场主要是生产制糖的甜菜，同时也种植粮食和菜疏，饲养各种牲畜和家禽。农业工人们在这里使用着四十五架拖拉机、十架联合收割机、四架复合打谷机、四架甜菜联合机和十六辆运货卡车，以进行农作。并且用飞机在农场上进行施肥工作。广阔的家畜场，还设有电气挤乳机、自动切草机和输送饲料的输送带。这个国家农场中工人和职员的宿舍正在不断增加。在工作之暇，工人们就到俱乐部、电影院和图书馆去，参加文化娱乐活动，这已成为他们日常生活的一部分。苏联有大量的类似国营“红军”甜菜农庄的企业。
    △在乌兹贝克共和国，有一位名叫玛利亚。特雷尼娜的老农妇，最近荣获政府所颁发的“母亲之光”勋章，这样，这一家人所获得的政府勋章已达到六十个之多。玛利亚·特雷尼娜的五个儿子、一个女儿和五个孙子都曾参加对德战争。她家的彼得·特雷宁由于在渡过德聂泊河时所表现的勇敢和英雄主义，得到“苏联英雄”的称号。这一家其他的人则担任航空员、坦克驾驶员、工兵、步兵和护士，都得到了几个战斗勋章。这一家有两个人战时在国家农场工作，因为他们的忘我劳动也得到了勋章。战后特雷尼娜全家都恢复了和平时期的努力。苏联英雄彼得·特雷宁在国家农庄工作，又因对谷类获得丰收有功而得到“社会主义劳动英雄”的光荣称号。
