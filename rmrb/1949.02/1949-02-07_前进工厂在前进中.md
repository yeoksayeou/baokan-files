　　The Forward Factory is Moving Forward
　　Tian Liu, Zhang Shen
　　In November 1948, simultaneously with the heroic展開展開 of the People's Liberation Army to liberate all of North China, over a thousand workers at the Shijiazhuang Forward Factory launched an unprecedentedly enthusiastic production emulation movement. Starting from November 15th and ending at the end of December, in one and a half months, they exceeded the production plan for two months, with output soaring to 156%, far exceeding the production levels during the enemy-puppet Kuomintang rule. In addition to making up for the losses of half a month of work stoppage during the war preparation period (last October), it also increased revenue by 420,000 catties of millet.
　　At the beginning of the production emulation movement, eighteen young workers from the decoration workshop, including Wu Guirong and Wu Guoshan, secretly organized mutual aid groups. After quickly completing their own tasks, they immediately went to help other workers. Lu Laixiang, a worker in the machine workshop, completed eight connecting rod tiles in two days, which normally would have taken three days. Comrade Zhao Wenhao, who served as the Minister of Education of the Shijiazhuang Workers' Union during the "February 7th" strike, became the director of the machine workshop after liberation. He often compared the past with the present, talking about his forty years of worker life and inspiring the workers' production enthusiasm. He was so closely linked to all the workers in the workshop that everyone discussed and studied every job together. "Many people have strong ideas." During the competition, they separated the machines for dedicated use, specializing in what they did, and people were assigned more fixed tasks. As a result, the more than 400 machine and freight car axles and more than 700 bearings that would have taken more than two months to complete before the competition were completed in forty days. The "screw nut" production from the repair workshop can more clearly show the rapid increase in the workers' production enthusiasm. Before liberation, they made 30 per day, after liberation they made 50, slowly increasing to 70, and during the competition, it increased to 130. Liu Chunhe, the head of the production section who led the reporter on a tour of the factory, took us to the machine workshop and stopped beside the rapidly rotating machines – there, every worker standing in front of the machine tool was concentrating with both hands, deftly and accurately grasping the various parts being manufactured – reminiscing, "Before liberation, the machines also spun as fast as they do now, but the workers were either chatting with each other or secretly gambling, and the machines spun without producing anything." Walking towards the decoration workshop, he added with a smile, "At that time, I was the supervisor of the decoration workshop. I didn't gamble, and I always read a book of novels. ………”
　　After work, in the workers' club, Xing Guoxiang, a worker from the repair workshop, told me: "If we produce more, the railways can be built longer, and we railway workers use the railways to support the front lines. When the revolution is victorious, our lives will be better. Putting in more effort now is for the future!" This is the unanimous belief of more than a thousand workers at the Forward Factory. From the production emulation movement that began on November 15th until it ended at the end of December, the workers' production enthusiasm increased every day. When enemy planes came to harass, the air raid sirens resounded throughout the city, but many workers were still engaged in intense production. Li Xiaoliang, a worker from the decoration workshop, rushed to complete the installation of the water mercury being hoisted, unwilling to put it down halfway to avoid wasting time when redoing it, and finally persisted in finishing it. As for going to work early and leaving late, that has become a common occurrence. The workers often wait in the workshop, and as soon as the bell rings to start work, the belt immediately starts to rotate. Comrade Ji Gensheng, an old "February 7th" worker who won a special model award in the competition, is already 67 years old with gray hair. According to the factory's regulations, he has reached the age of "retirement" and could sit at home and receive a pension to "enjoy his old age," but he still insists on going to work. When answering the reporter's interview, his eyes often welled up with excited tears. He said: "I have suffered for more than forty years, and it is for this that the factory has finally become our workers' own. I am not old, and I still have to work hard for a few more years!" This is true, with the liberation of Shijiazhuang, he also became younger, as if rejuvenated. Over the past year, he has always been running when he walks, and he has been teaching his skills to the young workers. At the end of October, when the Kuomintang bandit army attacked Shijiazhuang, he abandoned his old wife and young grandchildren to escort the machines to a safe area. This time in the competition, he was even more ecstatic, starting a fire and sweeping the workshop half an hour before work, preparing the day's work for the workers. After work, he also cleaned up the tools and organized the machines. After everything was arranged, he locked the door and ran home with a smile on his face. All the workers in this regard should also receive honor and praise. "Don't stop working until the job is finished" is the unanimous action of the workers. During the competition, 252 workers increased "voluntary work" by 2,376 hours. This is not a small thing, it marks the class consciousness of the workers of the Forward Factory. The workers also completely regard the factory as their own, willing to dedicate everything within their power to production, without any remuneration.
　　The liberated workers are not satisfied with the intense labor of their hands, they are even more creating, inventing, and improving their production methods and techniques with the unique talents of the proletariat. In the short period of one and a half months of the competition, there were no less than eighty technical inventions and improvements alone. The "self-locking" manufacturing method researched and improved by Li Xiaowu, a worker in the civil engineering workshop, increased output by three times. Others, such as the method of using steam boiler pressure to pump water created by the deputy director of the furnace workshop, and the use of waste materials to manufacture white lead oil by the craftsman Fan Xichang in the vehicle workshop, ... all greatly improved production efficiency and reduced costs. The combination of the workers' unprecedentedly enthusiastic production enthusiasm and technical inventions and improvements guaranteed the victory of the production emulation movement, and the output increased unprecedentedly. Repairing a locomotive required 27 workers and 4 machines in the enemy-puppet occupied era, 38 workers and 6 machines in the Kuomintang rule era, but now it only takes 21 workers and 3 machines to complete it.
　　The Forward Factory has not disgraced its glorious name. The past year was a year of rapid advancement for the Shijiazhuang Forward Factory. All the workers used the victory of production to see off 1948. In the days when the Chinese people will achieve greater victories in 1949, all the workers of the Forward Factory have set new and greater goals. They want to reach 300% of the production level of the same period last year in the first quarter of this year.
　　The wheels of victory for the Chinese people are advancing rapidly, and the Shijiazhuang Forward Factory is also advancing rapidly.

　　前进工厂在前进中
    田流  张深
    一九四八年十一月，和解放军英勇的展开解放全华北之战同时，石家庄前进工厂千余职工，展开了空前热烈的增产竞赛运动，从十一月十五日开始到十二月底结束，一个半月超过了两个月的生产计划，产量突增到百分之一百五十六，远远的超过了敌伪国民党统治时代的生产水平，除弥补了备战期间（去年十月）停工半月的损失外，还增加收益四十二万斤小米。
    在增产竞赛运动一开始，装修所十八个青年工人吴桂荣、吴过山等，就暗暗的组织了互助组，赶紧完成自己的任务后，便立即去帮助别的工友。机工所工友卢来祥两天完成了八个连杆瓦，在正常的生产情况下，这是需要三天才能完成的。曾任“二七”大罢工的石家庄工会教育部长赵文浩同志，解放后任了机工所的主任，他常常“将古比今”的谈着他四十年来的工人生活，激励着工人们的生产热情。他是那样的和全所工人亲密的连结在一起，每一件活都是大家商量研究。“人多主意强”，在竞赛中，他们把机器分开专用，作什么的专作什么，人也较固定的分工，这样熟能生巧，结果在竞赛前，需要两个月以上才能完成的四百多根机货车轴、七百多个轴承，四十天就完成了。从修配所打“螺丝母”就能更清楚的看出工人们生产热情在迅速的提高着。解放前，每日打三十个，解放后打五十个，慢慢的增加到七十个，而竞赛期中，则提高到一百三十个。领记者在全厂各处参观的生产科长刘春和，引我们到机工所，在飞速转动着的机器旁停下来——那里，每个机床前面站着的工友，都全神贯注地用着双手，敏捷而准确的把捉着正在制造中的各种机件——回忆的说：“解放前，机器也象现在一样的飞速转动，但工友们不是互相聊天，就是偷偷的赌钱，机器干转不出活。”走向装修所的路上，他笑着补充：“那时我是装修所的监工员，我不会赌钱，总是抱着一本子小说在读。………”
    下工后，在工人俱乐部里，修配所工人邢国祥告诉我说：“我们多生产些，铁路就能修得更长，俺们铁路工人就是拿铁路来支援前线的。革命胜利了，我们的生活就更好。现在多出点力，是为了将来啊！”这是前进工厂千余职工的一致信念。从十一月十五便开始的增产竞赛运动，直到十二月底结束，工人们的生产热情是天天增涨着。敌机来扰，警报声响彻市空，不少工人仍在紧张的生产，装修所工友李小良，抢着完成正在吊起的水汞的装置，不肯中途放下，以免重作时浪费时间，终于坚持着把它作完。至于早上班晚下班，那已经成了普遍的事情，工友们常在车间里等待着，只要上班的钟声一响，轮带就立时转动起来，在竞赛中获得特等模范的“二七”老工人计根生同志，已经是发须斑白六十七岁的高龄了。按照工厂的规定，已经到了“退休”的年龄，满可以坐在家里，领着养老金“以乐晚年”了，但他仍然坚持着上工。他在答复记者的访问时，眼里常常涌起兴奋的泪花，他说：“我受苦受难四十多年，就是为了这，工厂到底变成我们工人自己的了，我不老，我还得正经干它几年呢！”这是实在的，随着石家庄的解放，他也由老还童，变得年青起来。一年来，他总是飞跑着走路，他教授着他的技术给年轻的工友们。十月末，国民党匪军偷袭石家庄时，他抛开老妻弱孙，押送机器到安全地带去，这次竞赛，他更是欢欣若狂，上工前半小时就在工作室生火、扫地，给工人们准备好当天的活计。下工后，他又收拾工具，整理机器。一切安排就绪后，然后才锁上门，满面笑容的飞跑着回家去。全体工人在这方面，同样应获得荣誉与歌颂，“干不完一手活不下工”，是职工们一致的行动。在竞赛期间，有二百五十二个工人，增加“义务工”二千三百七十六小时。这并不是一件小事情，它标帜着前进工厂工人的阶级觉悟。职工们也都是把工厂完全看成是自己的，愿意把自己力所能及的一切献给生产，而不要任何报酬。
    解放了的工人们，并不满足他们双手的紧张劳作，他们更以无产阶级独有的才能，创造、发明，改进着自己的生产方法和技术。在短短的一个半月的竞赛期间，仅技术的发明改进就不下八十余件。民工所工人李小五研究改进的“自连锁”制造法，提高了产量三倍。其他如制炉所副主任创造的利用蒸汽锅炉压水法，车辆所工匠范喜长利用废料制造白铅油，……都大大的提高了生产效率，减低了成本。职工们这种空前热烈的生产情绪和技术的发明改进结合起来，就保证了增产竞赛运动的胜利，产量空前的提高起来。修理一辆机车，在敌伪侵占时代需要二十七个工人四部机器，国民党统治时代需要三十八个工人六部机器，而现在只需二十一个工人三部机器就能完成了。
    前进工厂没有辱没了它光荣的名字，过去的一年，是石家庄前进工厂飞速前进的一年，全厂职工用生产的胜利。送走了一九四八年。在一九四九年中国人民将获得更大的胜利的日子里，前进工厂的全体职工，又订出了新的更大的目标，他们要在今年第一季达到去年同期生产水平的百分之三百。
    中国人民胜利的车轮在飞速前进，石家庄前进工厂也在飞速的前进。
