The People's Militia and Self-Defense Forces in the People's Liberation War
    North China People's Armed Forces

    The North China People's Armed Forces – the militia and self-defense forces – grew and strengthened during the intense and cruel War of Resistance Against Japan. They are people's armed forces that were spontaneously organized under the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party to oppose the plunder and massacres of imperialism and the oppression of the traitorous Chiang Kai-shek bandit gang.

    During the eight years of the War of Resistance Against Japan, the militia and self-defense forces in various regions not only actively cooperated with the troops in combat, but also bravely fought the enemy independently. They extensively carried out mass guerrilla warfare, playing an extremely important role in covering the masses, protecting materials, smashing the Japanese invaders' brutal mopping-up operations, persisting in work in enemy areas, opening up new areas, and cooperating in various struggles. Militias in various regions created landmines and launched explosion campaigns, established joint defense between districts and villages, and carried out village tunnel warfare. Militias in mountainous and plain areas created new militia tactics, and many militia combat heroes and explosion heroes emerged, along with countless heroic and moving stories. They played an extremely significant role in the victory of the War of Resistance Against Japan.

    After the Japanese invaders surrendered, Chiang Kai-shek, with the assistance of American imperialism, continued to attack the people, attempting to swallow the fruits of the victory of the War of Resistance and maintain his reactionary rule. He plundered grain, conscripted soldiers, raped, and massacred everywhere, and his brutal and barbaric behavior was no less than that of the Japanese invaders. Therefore, the people's armed forces continued to bear the glorious task of protecting grain, protecting conscripts, protecting land, and protecting their homes, further utilizing and developing the combat experience of the War of Resistance Against Japan to wage a tenacious struggle against the enemy.

    In the two and a half years of the People's Liberation War, the North China People's Armed Forces achieved brilliant results in fighting the enemy. The following incomplete statistics from some areas from 1946 to September 1948 give a glimpse of this:

    Taiyue District: The militia fought independently 10,923 times, cooperated with the troops 1,677 times, killing, wounding, and capturing 22,896 enemies. The main seizures were 5 cannons, 206 machine guns, 21 submachine guns, 4,831 rifles, 365 pistols, and 370,374 rounds of ammunition.

    Taihang District: The militia fought independently and in cooperation a total of 35,044 times, killing, wounding, and capturing 18,032 enemies. The main seizures were 71 cannons, 84 machine guns, 3,707 rifles, 709 pistols, 107,966 rounds of ammunition, and 52 enemy bunkers destroyed.

    Beiyue District: The militia fought independently and in cooperation a total of 11,736 times, killing, wounding, and capturing 15,859 enemies. The seizures and destruction included 38 vehicles, 4,871 enemy bunkers destroyed, 31 cannons seized, 90 machine guns, 18 submachine guns, 4,065 rifles, 108 pistols, and 110,104 rounds of ammunition.

    Jizhong District: The militia fought independently and in cooperation a total of 5,498 times, killing, wounding, and capturing 5,903 enemies. The seizures and destruction included 13 enemy vehicles, 1,110 enemy bunkers destroyed, 10 cannons seized, 26 machine guns, 1,459 rifles, 140 pistols, and 297,640 rounds of ammunition.

    The total for the above four districts is that the militia fought independently and in cooperation 64,878 times, killing, wounding, and capturing 62,690 enemies. The seizures and destruction included 51 enemy vehicles, 6,024 enemy bunkers destroyed, 117 cannons seized, 406 machine guns, 39 submachine guns, 14,062 rifles, 1,322 pistols, and 886,084 rounds of ammunition.

    In addition, the figures for the Jinan, Jilu and Yu districts, and the second sub-district of Jinzhong have not yet been compiled (the statistics for the first sub-district of Jinzhong are included in the Beiyue district, and the statistics for the third sub-district are included in the Taiyue district).

    In the militia's combat, many combat heroes and heroic stories emerged. For example, more than a hundred militiamen from Sibaitu Village in Ding County, Beiyue District, led by militia captain Hao Qingshan, repeatedly defeated several attacks by more than 2,000 enemies equipped with machine guns and small cannons. Shi Bingyin from Xushui County led more than ten militiamen to frequently penetrate deep behind enemy lines, ambushing vehicles on the enemy's supply lines. On one occasion, they seized thirteen American-made trucks fully loaded with materials and safely drove them into the liberated area. The militiamen of Jinwu and Rongding Counties in the Central Hebei bravely fought behind enemy lines and established consolidated base areas. More than forty militiamen from Jiexiu in the Taiyue District completely annihilated more than a hundred enemies who came to harass them in Sendai. There are many similar model cases.

    In the People's Liberation War, the militia and self-defense forces demonstrated their powerful strength and greatness in participating in the war effort and supporting the front. When participating in the war, the militia were responsible for containing and guarding against the enemy, attacking the enemy on the flanks, or assisting the troops in close-range operations on the front lines, cleaning up the battlefield, clearing out and capturing scattered enemies, escorting and guarding prisoners of war, and guarding warehouses. The self-defense forces were responsible for rescuing and transporting the wounded, transporting ammunition, grain, and other war materials. During the more than two years of war, tens of thousands of militiamen and laborers spontaneously and actively flocked to the front lines for each campaign. According to statistics from the Central Hebei and North Hebei Districts from the Zhengtai Campaign in May 1947 to the Pingjin Campaign, and the Taihang and Taiyue Districts' participation in the Taiyuan Campaign, 69,890 militiamen, 312,500 engineering teams (militiamen specializing in assisting troops with fortifications), 75,664 stretchers, 410,261 stretcher bearers, 36,340 carts, and 17,360 pack mules were mobilized. This is only the number of those accompanying the army; the manpower in the second line and rear areas is not included.

    According to statistics from the former Jinjiluyu Border Region on the front-line militia and laborers participating in the war effort from July 1946 to June 1947, a total of 74,899,599 workdays were used. In the Central Hebei District, a total of 128,196,737 workdays were used in the front and rear areas from the whole year of 1947 to September 1948.

    From the above incomplete statistics, we can see how actively and enthusiastically the people supported the war. Similarly, in the process of participating in the war and supporting the front, numerous meritorious models and heroic deeds emerged in the militia and self-defense forces in various regions. For example, when Liu Deng and Chen Xie's armies crossed the Yellow River in July 1947, the militia and laborers from the Taihang, Taiyue, and Jiluyu Districts followed the army south, some of whom followed the army in battles in the Central Plains and only returned after half a year. In the spring of 1948, the laborers of Central Hebei followed the army in battles inside and outside the Great Wall of Jichareliao and only returned after eight months. In each county and district, there were meritorious models who took the lead, not only voluntarily participating in completing the tasks, but also guaranteeing that the members of their own company and team would not return home until the tasks were completed. The laborers' care for the wounded was meticulous. They not only used their own clothes and quilts to make the wounded comfortable and reduce their pain, but also used their own savings to buy eggs and snacks for the wounded and personally took care of their bodily needs. Similarly, the troops took good care of the laborers. When there were few houses, the troops camped outdoors and let the laborers live in the houses, buying pigs and meat to comfort the laborers. The unity and friendship between the troops and the laborers created countless moving stories.

    In addition to fighting the enemy, participating in the war, and supporting the front, the militia and self-defense forces were also responsible for suppressing bandits and preventing special agents, maintaining rear area security, and protecting transportation. For example, the militia of Jiluyu and Taiyue guarded the Yellow River river defense, and the militia of Jinan cooperated with the troops to suppress the Feixiang riot. The militia and self-defense forces in the liberated areas laid a dragnet for all bandits, special agents, and traitors, and it was difficult for these elements to escape from the hands of the people.

    In the process of land reform, the militia and self-defense forces, for the sake of their own land and vital interests, more actively struggled against reactionary landlords and rich peasants, suppressed the sabotage activities of reactionary elements, and played a major role in the completion of land reform.

    In short, the militia and self-defense forces, in the War of Resistance Against Japan and the People's Liberation War, tempered themselves, raised their political awareness, and gained experience in armed struggle. They used primitive earthen guns, earthen cannons, broadswords, and spears to seize the enemy's machine guns, rifles, small cannons, and other modern weapons to equip themselves, and have become a powerful armed force with rich combat experience. They will cooperate with and support the People's Liberation Army to continue to complete the glorious historical task of liberating all of China.

　　人民解放战争中的民兵自卫队
    华北人民武装部
    华北人民武装——民兵自卫队，是在紧张残酷的抗日战争过程中生长壮大起来的，是人民为了反对帝国主义的抢掠屠杀及卖国贼蒋介石匪帮的压迫，在中国共产党的领导下，自动组织起来的人民武装。
    八年抗日战争中，各地民兵自卫队，不仅主动积极的配合部队作战，而且英勇的单独对敌作战，普遍广泛的开展了群众性的游击战，对掩护群众，保卫物资，粉碎日寇历次残酷扫荡，坚持敌区工作，开辟新区工作，配合各种斗争等，都起过了极重要的作用，各地民兵创造了地雷，开展爆炸运动，建立区村联防，开展村落地道战。山地及平原的民兵，都创造了新的民兵战术，出现了不少民兵战斗英雄与爆炸英雄，涌现了无数可歌可泣的英勇故事，对于抗日战争的胜利，是起了极其伟大的作用的。
    日寇投降以后，蒋介石在美帝国主义援助下，继续向人民进攻，企图吞食抗战胜利果实，维持其反动统治，到处抢粮、抓丁、奸淫、屠杀，其残暴野蛮行为，较日寇无稍逊色。于是人民武装继续负担了保粮、保丁、保卫土地、保卫家乡的光荣任务，进一步运用与发挥了抗日战争的斗争经验，向敌人进行了顽强的斗争。
    在二年半的人民解放战争中，华北人民武装在对敌作战方面，获得了辉煌的成绩，从下面部分地区，自一九四六年至一九四八年九月份极不完整的战绩统计中，即可见一班。
    太岳区：民兵单独作战一○、九二三次，配合部队作战一、六七七次，毙伤俘敌人二二、八九六名，主要缴获炮五门，机枪二○六挺，冲锋枪二一挺、步枪四、八三一枝，手枪三六五枝，子弹三七○、三七四发。
    太行区：民兵单独与配合作战合计三五、○四四次，毙伤俘敌人一八、○三二名，主要缴获炮七一门，机枪八四挺，步枪三、七○七枝，手枪七○九枝，子弹一○七、九六六发，毁敌碉堡五二个。
    北岳区：民兵单独与配合作战合计一一、七三六次，毙伤俘敌人一五、八五九名，缴获与破坏汽车三八辆，毁敌碉堡四、八七一个，缴获炮三一门，机枪九○挺，冲锋枪一八枝，步枪四、○六五枝，手枪一○八枝，子弹一一○、一○四发。
    冀中区：民兵单独与配合作战合计五、四九八次，毙伤俘敌人五、九○三名，缴获与破坏敌汽车一三辆，毁敌碉堡一、一○一座，缴获炮一○门，机枪二六挺，步枪一、四五九枝，手枪一四○枝，子弹二九七、六四○发。
    以上四个地区合计，民兵单独与配合作战六四、八七八次，毙伤俘敌人六二、六九○名，缴获与破坏敌汽车五一辆，毁敌碉堡六、○二四座，缴获炮一一七门，机枪四○六挺，冲锋枪三九支，步枪一四、○六二支，手枪一、三二二枝，子弹八八六、○八四发。
    此外尚有冀南及冀鲁豫两区及晋中二分区数字还未曾统计（晋中一分区统计在北岳区内，三分区统计在太岳区内了）。
    在民兵作战中，出现了不少战斗英雄与英勇故事，例如北岳区定县四白土村民兵百余人，在民兵队长郝庆山领导下，连续击溃带有机枪小炮的两千余敌人的数次进攻。徐水县师丙寅带领民兵十余人经常深入敌后，在敌人的补给线上伏击汽车，其中有一次，一下缴获了满载物资的美造大卡车十三辆，安全开入解放区。冀中津武及容定县民兵在敌后英勇斗争，建立起巩固根据地。太岳介休民兵四十余人在仙台全部歼灭出扰之敌百余名。太行修武县的刘松轮战队，全队二十五人，经常深入敌后，出奇制胜，打击敌人，类似这样的模范事例是很多的。
    在人民解放战争中，民兵自卫队在参战支前中，更表现了他们力量的雄厚与伟大。民兵参战时担任着牵制警戒与打击侧冀之敌，或协助部队在火线上进行近迫作业、打扫战场，清剿捕捉溃散敌人，押送与看守俘虏，看守仓库等任务。自卫队则担任抢救与运送伤员，运输弹药粮秣作战器材等任务。两年多的战争中，每次战役都有成千成万的民兵民工自动的积极的涌上前线。只就冀中、北岳两区自一九四七年五月正太战役至平津战役以及太行太岳参加太原战役的随军民兵民工的统计即动员了随军民兵六九、八九○人，土工队（专门协助部队做工事的民兵）三一二、五○○人，担架七五、六六四付，担架员四一○、二六一人，大车三六、三四○辆，驮骡一七、三六○匹。这只是随军的数字，第二线及后方的民力尚未统计在内。
    另据原晋冀鲁豫边区在一九四六年七月至一九四七年六月一年内参战支前的前方民兵民工统计，共用了七四、八九九、五九九个工。冀中区在一九四七年全年至一九四八年九月份前后方，共用工数为一二八、一九六、七三七个。
    从以上这些不完整的统计数字中，可以看到人民是怎样的积极踊跃的支援战争，同样在参战支前的过程中，各地民兵自卫队，也出现了无数的功臣模范，与英勇的事迹，例如一九四七年七月刘邓、阵谢大军南渡黄河时，太行、太岳、冀鲁豫各区民兵民工随军南下，有的随军转战中原，历时半年之久才回来。一九四八年春季，冀中民工随军转战冀察热辽长城内外，历时八阅月才回来，各县、各区的民兵民工中，都有功臣模范带头，不仅自己自动参加完成任务，并保证本连本队的队员不完成任务不回家。民工们对伤员的爱护无微不至，不仅用自己的衣服被子给伤员铺好盖好，减少伤员的痛苦，而且用自己节余的钱给伤员买鸡子点心，亲手给伤员接屎接尿，都是极其普遍的事。同样，部队对民工照顾也很周到，房子少时，部队露营，把房子让给民工住，买猪买肉慰劳民工。部队民工的团结友爱，创造了无数的动人的故事。
    民兵自卫队除了对敌作战参战支前以外，还担负着剿匪防特、维持后方治安、保护交通种种任务。例如冀鲁豫与太岳的民兵看守黄河河防，冀南民兵配合部队镇压了肥乡暴动等等。解放区的民兵自卫队，给一切匪特奸细分子布置着天罗地网，奸特分子是很难逃出人民之手的。
    在土地改革过程中，民兵自卫队为了自己的土地和切身的利益，更积极的向反动地主富农进行斗争，镇压反动分子的破坏活动，对土地改革的完成上，起了重大的作用。
    总之，民兵自卫队，在抗日战争及人民解放战争中，锻炼了自己，提高了政治觉悟，获得了武装斗争的经验，利用原始的土枪、土炮、大刀、长矛，夺获了敌人的机枪、步枪、小炮等现代武器装备了自己，已经成为一种有丰富的战斗经验，强大的武装力量，他们将要配合与支援人民解放军，继续完成解放全中国的光荣的历史任务。
