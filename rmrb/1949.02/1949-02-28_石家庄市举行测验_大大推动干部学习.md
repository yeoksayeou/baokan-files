　　Shijiazhuang City Holds Test
　　Greatly Promotes Cadre Learning
　　To promote learning and improve the theoretical level of cadres, the Shijiazhuang City Learning Committee held a cadre learning test on February 10th, with 273 cadres at or above the county level participating. The test content was divided into two types: "Outline of the History of Social Development" and "Concise History of Social Development." The test results showed that the former had an average score of 58 points, with the Education Bureau of the Municipal Committee performing relatively well. The latter had an average score of over 73 points, with the Education Bureau being the best among all units and Zhenhua Industrial Company being the worst. During the summary on the 19th, it was unanimously agreed that the test promoted the learning of cadres throughout the city, and that testing should become a regular system. Many comrades with lower educational levels enthusiastically participated in cultural literacy schools. Bad habits such as carelessness in learning were also overcome. However, the test still had some shortcomings, such as insufficient preparation beforehand and the questions lacking a systemic approach. The lists of participants and learning content were not well-coordinated, resulting in some comrades participating in the wrong test group.

　　石家庄市举行测验
    大大推动干部学习
    石家庄市学委会为推动学习提高干部理论水平，于二月十日举行了干部学习测验，有相当县级以上干部二百七十三人参加。测验内容分“社会发展史纲”与“社会发展简史”两种。测验结果，前者平均分数五十八分，其中以市委会教育局成绩较好；后者平均分数七十三分以上，各单位中最好的是教育局，最差的是振华实业公司。十九日总结时一致认为这次的测验推动了全市干部的学习，测验应成为一种经常的制度。许多文化水平较低的同志都踊跃参加文化补习学校；学习上的粗枝大叶等不好的作风也克服了。但这次的测验仍有一些缺点：如事先准备不够，题目有点系统；参加测验的名单与学习内容未很好进行统计，以致有不少同志参加错了测验组。
