　　Military Families with Labor Capacity and No Difficulties in Life Should Not Request Substitute Farming
Editor:
    I have two questions, please provide answers.
    (1) Substitute Farming Issue: My family consists of seven members, including my brother who is forty-three years old and suffers from tuberculosis. My eldest nephew enlisted in the army four or five years ago and currently works in the Business Management Section of the Third Production Management Office of the North China Military Region Enterprise Department. I have retired from military service twice due to illness and have been working in the training regiment since 1947. My second nephew is eighteen years old and studying at school, helping with farm work during busy seasons. My sister-in-law and two nieces are unable to work. My family farms 2.6 mu of first-class paddy fields, 2 mu of upper third-class paddy fields, 5 mu of second-class dry land, and 10 mu of third-class land, and we also raise a small mule. The land's yield is insufficient, so my brother uses the mule to find additional means of livelihood to make ends meet. This is my family's situation. The village cadres are asking me to provide substitute farming for others. Please advise whether I should provide substitute farming.
    (2) During this year's land redistribution, the dry land in our village was not surveyed. My dry land is registered according to old deeds, which include barren slopes that have never been cultivated. Should an exception be made, or should the registration be based on the actual cultivated acreage?
    Additionally, some households in our village who enjoy substitute farming are not without labor. They deliberately divide their families to obtain substitute farming. For example, in the case of Zhao Gang, after he joined the army, his brother divided the family, with the elderly mother assigned to Zhao Gang's side. Based on population, Zhao Gang received two-thirds of the land, and the entire village provides substitute farming for him, even including the land his wife accumulated at her parents' home. Is this correct?

    Answer: According to your letter, your family is a military family with labor capacity. Your brother is still of working age, and if he is indeed unable to perform full labor due to tuberculosis, the village can democratically assess and reduce his service duties accordingly. Although your family has a shortage of labor, you also raise a mule, which can help solve the farming problem.
    According to the North China People's Government's regulations on wartime service: "Military families with labor capacity, if they do not have difficulties in life, the village may not provide substitute farming for them." Now that the village is short of labor, your family does not need the village to provide substitute farming, nor do you need to provide substitute farming for others.
    As for the barren slopes and small path land, regardless of whether they are registered during land redistribution, as long as they are cultivatable but left uncultivated, they should be subject to burden based on the land's yield. If they are truly uncultivatable, they can be exempted. You mentioned that individual military families in your village are dividing their families to disperse labor in order to enjoy substitute farming from others. This is not good and should be explained to them the meaning of substitute farming which is to solve the difficulties in the lives of poor and labor-less martyrs, soldiers and their families. Even substitute farming is limited to the direct relatives of soldiers, such as parents, wives, and children. If the parents are separated from the wife and children, the wife and children should enjoy the benefits, or the parents can enjoy them, but not both. For example, if a soldier's parents are receiving military family benefits at home, and his wife is also asking others to provide substitute farming at her parents' home, that is incorrect.

### 军属有劳力生活不困难不应要求代耕

专栏：询问与答复

　　军属有劳力生活不困难不应要求代耕编辑同志：
    我有两个问题，请给解答。
    （一）代耕问题：我家男女七口人，哥哥今年四十三岁，是个有痨疾的人。大侄子入伍四、五年，现在华北军区企业部第三生产管理处经营科工作，我因病退伍过两次，自一九四七年到补训团工作。二侄今年十八岁，在学校念书，农忙时帮助家里生产，嫂嫂和两个侄女，全不能劳动，我家种一等水地二亩六分，上三等水地二亩，白地二等五亩，三等地十亩，还喂一个小骡。地里出产，并不够用，靠我哥哥用小骡另找一点生活，才能够吃。我家的情形就是这样的。村干部叫我给别人家代耕，请给我解答，是否应给别人家代耕？
    （二）今年平分土地，我村的白地没有查过，我的白地是按从前旧文契上登记的，根本没有种过的荒坡道。是否应该例外或按实种的亩数登记？
    另外，我村享受代耕户，并非没有劳动力。但他们故意把家分开，以便得到代耕。如象赵岗家，他参军走了，他哥把家分了，老母分到赵岗这边。按人口，赵岗分得三分之二的地，全村就给他代耕，连他妻在娘家积成的地也代耕着。这样对吗？
  　　　　　　　　　　（平山县第六区栲栲台村张树春）
    答：据来信所谈，你家是一个有劳力的军属。你哥哥还是在年龄的劳动者，如确因痨疾而不能顶全劳力，可经村中民主评议，按有病者减服勤务。你家虽然人力较缺，但还养一头骡子，是可以解决耕种问题的。
    按华北人民政府规定的战勤办法：“有劳力的烈军属，如生活不困难，村中可以不给他代耕。”现在村上劳力缺乏，你家不需要村上给代耕，但也不给别人代耕。
    至于荒坡小道地，不管在平分土地时登记与否，只要是能种而荒了不种的，应该按地亩产量出负担；如真是不能耕种的，则可免出。你说你村有个别的军属为了享受别人的代耕，实行分家以分散劳力，这是不好的，应该给他们讲解代耕的意义，是为了解决贫苦无劳力的烈、军、属生活的困难。即使代耕的也只限于军人的父母、妻子、儿女等直系亲属，如果父母与其妻子儿女分居者，应由其妻子、儿女享受，他父母享受也可，但不能双重享受。如军人他父母在家受军属优待，他妻子又在娘家还叫别人给代耕，这就不对。
