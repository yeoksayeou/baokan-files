【Shijiazhuang News】The "Comforting the Soldiers on the Tianjin-Beiping Front" movement is vigorously unfolding among workers in factories and industries, schools, government offices, and residents in districts and streets in Shijiazhuang. First, employees of public factories launched a campaign to support the army. All employees of the Qianjin Factory voluntarily worked two hours overtime, using the practical action of increasing production to support the front lines, and donated their wages to comfort the troops. Female workers at the Fanrong Factory are all vying to make慰问 bags. All employees of Yumin Industrial Company custom-made 650慰问 bags and specially made a batch of high-quality soap, with the words "慰劳" (Comfort) printed on them. The number of慰问 bags made by the brewery workers has exceeded twice the estimate. The Electric Light Company and the North China United Factory have both exceeded their targets by 100%. Among the industry workers, workers from the Electrical Workers Union specially ordered towels to send to the front. Various government offices and schools have become lively in the past few days: The Tax Bureau elected army-supporting cultural committee members on the morning of the 16th. Comrades from all departments of the Peace Hospital are busy making慰问 bags. The First District Second Street Cooperative voluntarily proposed to make 100慰问 bags, and each employee plans to embroider the words "Performing Meritorious Service for the People" and "Capture Chiang Kai-shek Alive" on the慰问 bags. Fifty-five shops in the Second District Third Street discussed making 720慰问 bags. The Third District City Promotion Agency made a total of 300慰问 bags. The Fourth District guaranteed to make 2,500慰问 bags at the army-supporting conference and organized people who could write letters to help the masses write comfort letters.
