　　Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, February 24th: TASS, Budapest: On February 14th, mass rallies were held in various parts of the Hungarian capital, where working people angrily protested against the imperialist anti-Hungarian propaganda and the attempts of Western powers to interfere in Hungary's internal affairs. Rivai, editor-in-chief of Szabad Nép, the central organ of the trade unions, emphasized in a speech to thousands of working people in the Budapest Sports Hall: The main reason why imperialism is organizing an anti-Hungarian movement is that the Hungarian Republic has eliminated Mindszenty, one of the main pawns of imperialism. Although Hungary is a small country, it will not tolerate impolite attitudes. The American minister in Hungary cannot do whatever he wants as in countries governed by the Marshall Plan. At a mass rally held in the club hall of the Mávag Railway Car Factory, Aprou, Secretary-General of the Hungarian Trade Union, declared that he represented the Hungarian working class and all working people in lodging the most resolute protest against attempts to interfere in Hungary's internal affairs. In a resolution unanimously passed at mass rallies held in various places on February 14th, the working people of Hungary stated: The working people of Hungary will take resolute action against the accomplices of imperialism and fight more fiercely against those enemies who are hostile to socialist construction.

　　匈京举行群众大会反对美帝干涉内政
    【新华社陕北二十四日电】塔斯社布达佩斯讯：二月十四日，匈牙利首都各处举行群众大会，劳动人民在大会上愤怒地抗议帝国主义反匈牙利的宣传与西方列强干涉匈牙利内政的企图。职工会中央机关报萨巴德·涅普报的总编辑里瓦伊，在布达佩斯运动大厅向数千劳动人民演讲时强调地说：帝国主义之所以组织反匈牙利的运动，主要是由于匈牙利共和国清除了帝国主义的主要走卒之一的明曾蒂。匈牙利虽然是个小国，但决不容忍无礼的态度。美国公使在匈牙利不能象在受马歇尔计划统治的国家一样为所欲为。在马维格火车车厢制造工厂俱乐部大厅举行的群众大会上，匈牙利职工会总书记阿普罗声称：他代表匈牙利工人阶级和全体劳动人民对干涉匈牙利内政的企图提出最坚决的抗议。在二月十四日各处举行的群众大会上，劳动人民一致通过一项决议称：匈牙利劳动人民将以坚决的行动对付帝国主义的共谋犯，以更激烈的斗争反对那些敌视社会主义建设的敌人。
