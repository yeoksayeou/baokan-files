　　Jianping Nine Villages Military Support Cooperative Survey
  　Annual Reduction of 20,000 Substitute Laborers
    [Zhangjiakou Electric Dispatch] Jianping Military Support Cooperatives have developed greatly in recent years. According to statistics from nine military support cooperatives, there are 542 members with capital of 257.7 million yuan. The profits from business operations have been used to solve the burden of substitute labor for the masses. There are three methods: (1) The Yandaogou Military Support Cooperative guarantees the actual output of the land under substitute cultivation. Half of the land in the village that should be cultivated on behalf of others is planted or leased to others. If the actual annual rental income is less than the actual output, 40% of the military support fund is drawn from the cooperative's profits to pay for it. This year, the cooperative undertook the substitute cultivation of 62.5 mu of dry land and 120 mu of sloping land, paying 21 large stones of corn, guaranteeing the actual output of the land cultivated on behalf of eight families of revolutionary martyrs and soldiers; (2) The Hongzidian Military Support Cooperative converts the substitute labor into cash based on the winter short-term labor market price and gives it to the families of revolutionary martyrs and soldiers so that they can hire people themselves. This stimulates the enthusiasm of the revolutionary martyrs and soldiers' families for production. If they produce more and hire fewer people, they can save part of the wages for their own use. The cooperative in this village paid for 7,123 substitute labor days, totaling 110 million yuan, solving the production difficulties of 117 families of soldiers and martyrs; (3) The Zaohudi Village Military Support Cooperative, which was organized only last August, uses the method of hiring long-term workers. The cooperative hires full-time workers, with one person responsible for the land of four families of revolutionary martyrs and soldiers, taking turns to work, with the cooperative paying the workers' wages and the soldiers' families providing meals. Village cadres are responsible for supervision and inspection, first solving the autumn substitute cultivation problem last year. In the past year, the nine military support cooperatives have used the above three methods to solve the production difficulties of 173 families of revolutionary martyrs and soldiers, reduced 11,560 substitute labor days for the masses, and paid 7,677 jin of grain and 14.37 million yuan in substitute labor wages. This has ensured the production and life of the families of revolutionary martyrs and soldiers, reduced the labor burden on the masses, and avoided the waste of civilian labor. Therefore, the masses strongly support such military support cooperatives.
    Editor's Note: Military support cooperatives are good in the sense of reducing the substitute labor burden on the masses, but is it appropriate to solve the substitute labor burden with the profits from business operations? Will it encourage a purely profit-oriented management method? Please study.

　　建屏九个村优军社调查
  　一年减少代耕工两万
    【张垣电】建屏优军合作社，近年来有很大发展。据九个优军社的统计，有社员五百四十二名，资金两亿五千七百余万元，以经营业务的盈利解决了群众的代耕负担。方法有以下三种：（一）沿道沟优军社是用保证代耕土地的实产量，将全村应代耕的土地半种或出租给别人耕种，全年实收入地租不足实产量之数，由优军社盈利中抽百分之四十的优军基金内支付。今年该社共担负代耕旱地六十二亩半，坡地一百二十亩，支付玉茭二十一大石，保证了八户烈军工属代耕地的实产量；（二）洪子店优军社是按冬季雇短工的市价，将代耕工折款交付军工烈属，由他自己雇人，这样刺激了烈军工属本人的生产积极性，自己多生产少雇人，可以节省一部分工资自己使用，该村优军社，共支代耕工七千一百廿三个，工资一亿一千万元，解决了一百一十七户军工烈属生产上的困难；（三）皂胡地村优军社，去年八月才组织起来，是用雇长工的方法，由优军社雇定专人，一人负责四户烈军工属的土地，轮流作活，由社内开支雇工工资，军属管饭，村干部负责督促检查，首先解决了去年的秋季代耕问题。九个优军社一年来用以上三种方法，解决了一百七十三户烈军工属的生产困难，并减少群众代耕工一万一千五百六十个，支付代耕工资粮食七千六百七十七斤，款一万四千三百七十万元。这样就使烈军工属的生产与生活有了保障，也减轻了群众的劳力负担，避免了浪费民力的现象，因之群众都很拥护这样的优军社。
    编者按：优军社从减轻群众代耕工的意义上说是很好的，但从营业的盈利上去解决代耕负担的办法是否妥当？是否会助长了单纯营利的经营方法？请研究。
