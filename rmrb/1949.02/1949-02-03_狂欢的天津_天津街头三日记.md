　　The Jubilant Tianjin
    Three Days of Records from Tianjin Streets
    Liu Boyu

    January 14, 1949, is a day the people of Tianjin will never forget. As the flag of victory fluttered on the city walls at dusk, and fierce fighting was still raging in the urban area, the Tianjin workers, seasoned in struggle, braved the artillery fire and heroically led their own army to attack the enemy's fortifications. In the command post of a certain division of the People's Liberation Army (PLA) set up in the Xiaoximen Needle Factory (which, just hours before, had been one of the positions used by the Chiang Kai-shek bandits to resist the PLA), the workers greeted the PLA soldiers like long-lost relatives, eagerly offering them warmth, boiling water, and serving tea. A worker named Zhang grasped the hand of a PLA soldier tightly and said, "Comrades! We've been looking forward to you like we've been looking forward to the stars and the moon. Today, we've finally got you!" He then angrily denounced the atrocities of the Kuomintang bandit troops in demolishing his house. In another place, when the smoothly advancing PLA captured the automobile repair factory, even before the remaining bandits within were completely eliminated and bullets were still whizzing around, the workers of the automobile factory excitedly shouted the slogan "Long live the Communist Party!"

    At dawn on the 15th, the battle unfolded in the city center. On the streets around Xiaoximen, groups of citizens were dismantling bunkers and fortifications, and reclaiming the sacks and timber that had been seized by the Chiang Kai-shek bandits to build fortifications. The citizens watched with admiring eyes as the PLA's artillery and tanks rumbled down the streets. The tram workers lined up at the entrance of their union to applaud the passing PLA soldiers, who nodded their thanks in their hurried advance. Many citizens vied to guide the PLA. They would simply say "Follow me" to the soldiers asking for directions, and lead the troops forward.

    The reporter entered Nankai Middle School, which had just been liberated, and the faculty members greeted the reporter with beaming faces and handshakes. They successively denounced the Kuomintang bandit troops for their acts of destruction and looting while stationed at the school. At the same time, they highly praised the PLA's excellent discipline.

    On the morning of the 16th, Tianjin, just liberated less than twenty hours earlier, was filled with a happy atmosphere. The dead city had come back to life. Order was quickly restored. Traffic police stood at their posts directing the passing vehicles. Many stores had already opened for business. Factories, protected by the joint efforts of the PLA and the workers, were actively preparing to resume production. Tram workers were busily repairing the lines. Electric and telephone workers climbed up the high poles to repair the power lines that had been severed by the artillery fire. Except for a few areas, most of Tianjin had never stopped providing electricity and water.

    On the main roads of the city, notices from the Military Control Commission maintaining social order and protecting public and private enterprises and schools attracted crowds of citizens. They eagerly read the news in the temporary edition of the Tianjin Daily in piles, or listened quietly to the speeches of the PLA propagandists.

    When large contingents of heroic PLA soldiers marched through the streets with orderly steps, the citizens responded with admiring gazes. Red and green slogans such as "Welcome the People's Liberation Army!" "Long Live the Chinese Communist Party!" and "Support Chairman Mao!" were plastered on walls and store windows everywhere. Crowds of people surrounded the wall newspapers published by Nankai University and Northeastern students, expressing welcome and gratitude to the PLA. On the streets, the propaganda trucks of Peiyang University drove slowly by. At the bustling intersection of Tianjin Quanyechang, a crowd of people surrounded the Nankai University Yangko team. In the crowd, female students beat drums and gongs, danced the Yangko, and sang newly composed songs of welcome to the PLA with joyful expressions.

    The two million people of Tianjin were seething with jubilation. On the faces of the long-oppressed and habitually sorrowful crowds, and on the sallow faces of the poor citizens and workers who had always lived in hunger, joyful smiles had appeared. The citizens of Tianjin had been swept up in the tide of victory. An elderly middle school teacher said that the citizens of Tianjin had never celebrated like this before.

　　狂欢的天津
    天津街头三日记
    刘伯羽
    一九四九年一月十四日是天津人民永远忘记不了的一天。当胜利的旗帜飘扬在黄昏的城垣上，而激战正在市区猛烈进行的时候，久经斗争的天津工人已经冒着炮火，英勇地给自己的军队带路去攻击敌人的工事了。设在小西门制针工厂里的解放军某师指挥所里（这里几小时前还是蒋匪据以抵抗解放军的阵地之一），工人们象会到了久别的亲人似地，纷纷向解放军问冷问暖，烧水送茶。一位姓张的工人紧握着一个解放军战士的手说：“同志！俺们象盼星星盼月亮似地盼着你们，今天可盼到了。”接着他就愤怒地控诉起国民党匪军拆毁他的房子的暴行来。在另一个地方，当顺利进展着的解放军攻占了汽车修理厂，厂内残匪尚未肃清，枪弹还在到处呼啸的时候，汽车厂的工人们就兴奋地喊着“共产党万岁！”的口号。
    十五日黎明，战斗已在市中心展开。小西门一带的街道上，成群的市民就在拆除地堡和工事，取回被蒋匪抢去修筑工事的麻袋和木料。市民们都用羡慕的目光看着解放军的大炮和坦克在街上隆隆滚过。电车工人们列队在工会门口向经过的解放军鼓掌，解放军的战士们则在匆促行进中向他们点头致谢。不少的市民争着给解放军带路。他们对问路的战士只简单地说一句“跟我走”，就这么把队伍领着前进了。
    记者走入刚解放不久的南开中学，教职员们满面春风地和记者握手。他们相继控诉国民党匪军驻扎该校时的破坏和劫掠行为。同时对解放军的优良纪律备加赞扬。
    十六日的早晨，这个刚刚解放不到二十小时的天津就充满了快乐的气氛。死城复活了。秩序迅速恢复了。交通警察站在自己的岗位上指挥着往来的车辆。许多商店都已开门营业。在解放军和工人们协力保护下的工厂已在积极地筹备复工。电车工人在紧张地修理线路。电灯电话工人爬在高杆上修理被炮火打断了的电线。除了少数地方，天津大部分地区一直没有停止过送电送水。
    市内各个要道上，军事管制委员会维护社会治安、保护公私企业和学校的布告吸引着成群的市民。他们成堆地争读着天津日报临时版的新闻，或是静听着解放军宣传员的讲话。
    当大队雄赳赳的解放军战士以整齐的步伐走过街头的时候，市民们都报以欣佩的眼光。“欢迎人民解放军！”“中国共产党万岁！”“拥护毛主席！”的红绿标语贴在各处的墙上和商店的玻璃窗上。南开大学和东北学生出版的欢迎和感谢解放军的墙报面前围着成群的人。街上，北洋大学的宣传卡车缓缓驶过。在热闹的天津劝业场的十字街头，簇拥的人群围着南开大学的秧歌队。在人群中，女学生们喜气洋洋地敲着锣鼓，扭着秧歌，唱着新编的欢迎解放军的歌子。
    天津两百万人民沸腾着狂欢。在久被压迫的惯常忧戚的人群的脸上，在一向在饥饿中度日的贫苦市民和工人们的菜黄色的脸上，已经显出了欢乐的笑容。天津市民已经卷入胜利的热潮中了。一个年老的中学教员说，天津市民从来没有象今天这样狂欢过。
