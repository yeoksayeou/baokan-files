　　What happened to the air defense funds in Huolu?
To the Editor:
　　I am a reader, and I have a question that I would like you to forward to Comrade Du Peizhi, Director of the Industry and Commerce Bureau of Huolu City. Last September, when enemy planes bombed the areas of Shijiazhuang, Daguocun, and Nanxincheng Village, Director Du actively called on representatives from various sectors of the city to discuss air defense measures. It was decided that representatives from various sectors would mobilize businesses to contribute funds to build air raid shelters. Businesses throughout the city contributed a total of more than 6 million Border Region currency. However, no air raid shelters have been built to this day. I wonder what this money has been used for? At that time, the price of rice was only 3,500 yuan per jin, but now rice in the city is 7,000 to 8,000 yuan per jin. If it is delayed any further, the value of this money will decrease and disappear. Please inquire about this as soon as possible.

To the Editor:
　　I have read in your newspaper the inquiry from Rong Jun of our city regarding the use of the funds raised last September for air raid shelters. I would like to present the true facts and the reasons, as well as our review and opinions on this matter, as follows.
　　Around the Mid-Autumn Festival last year, when enemy planes were frantically bombing the vicinity of Shijiazhuang, we decided to implement air defense measures such as digging air raid shelters in the market to protect the safety of the market and avoid losses. The Industry and Commerce Bureau was responsible for this, and it was planned to mobilize 6 million Border Region currency from the merchants, and the brigade headquarters would mobilize laborers to dig the shelters and provide appropriate compensation. Therefore, on the evening of the 17th day of the eighth lunar month, a meeting of representatives from various sectors was convened to explain the significance and issue a call to action. Everyone immediately responded and raised funds from various sectors, until the 10th day of the ninth lunar month when 4,976,500 Border Region currency had been collected. The long delay affected the timely construction. With the exception of 150,000 Border Region currency used for digging eight zhang of trenches in the city, other projects were halted as the autumn offensive of our army unfolded victoriously and enemy air raids gradually decreased. Because some of the funds were from outside vendors, and a small portion had already been used, it was impossible to return the money. It was also inappropriate to use it for the expenses of the Industry and Commerce Association, so it was decided to use it for other construction in the market. Two market blackboards have already been ordered, costing 850,000 Border Region currency; it is also planned to add a few more, and to use it for standard weights and measures. The remaining 3,976,500 Border Region currency is safely stored in our office.
　　We consulted with the municipal government and requested approval from the county bureau to use the raised funds for other construction expenses in the market. However, we did not promptly announce and explain this to the merchants, which was a shortcoming in our work. No one had personally inquired or discussed the handling of the matter with our office beforehand. The statement that merchants throughout the city contributed more than 6 million Border Region currency is not consistent with the facts. Furthermore, although there is a difference between the price level then and now, it is a matter of principle that public funds are not allowed to be used for disguised profiteering. Can tax revenue and the funds of the state bank be used to hoard materials based on price fluctuations? Of course, this is not allowed.

### 获鹿防空款干什么用了？

专栏：询问与答复

　　获鹿防空款干什么用了？编辑同志：
    我是一个读者，我现在有一点疑问，请你们给我转问获鹿市工商所所长杜培治同志。只因去年九月敌机轰炸石家庄、大郭村、南新城村一带时，杜所长积极号召本市各行代表商谈防空办法，议决各行代表动员各商户助款打防空壕、全市商户一共出款六百余万边币，但是到现在也没打防空壕，不知此款作何用？那时米价才三千五百元一斤，现在本市米已是七、八千一斤，如果再延迟下去，此款就会变少而无了。请快点问一下。
  　　获鹿市　荣隽编辑同志：
    顷阅贵报转来本市荣隽君询及去年九月募防空壕款作何用项之事，我特将事实真象原由及我们对此问题的检讨和意见陈述如下。
    去年中秋前后，敌机狂炸我石家庄近郊一带时，我们为了保卫集市安全、避免损失，特决定挖设市场防空壕等防空措施。由工商所负责，拟从商人中动员边币六百万元，大队部动员民夫挖壕，并给予适当报酬。因此在阴历八月十七日晚上召集各行代表会议说明意义，提出号召，大家随即响应，分从各行募集，直至阴历九月初十才凑足边币四百九十七万六千五百元。因时间拖拉太长，影响了及时建设。除城市挖壕八丈用边币十五万元外，其他工程因我军秋季攻势胜利展开，敌机袭扰渐稀，即告停止。所募集之款，因有外来摊贩一部，又已用了小部，退回已不可能。当作工商联合会开支又不恰当，才决定作市场其他建设之用。前已订购两块集市黑板，用边币八十五万元；还拟再添几块，及作标准尺秤之用。所余边币三百九十七万六千五百元，妥存本所。
    我们为将募款挪为集市其他建设费之用，曾与市政府商量，并请示县局批准。但未及时向商民宣布说明，是工作中的缺点。事前并未有人亲至本所询问和商讨处理意见。所说全市商人共出款六百余万元边币，与事实不符。再者，当时与今物价差异，但公款不准变相渔利，是原则问题。税款及国家银行之款能乘物价波动而囤积物资吗？当然是不允许的。　　　　　获鹿市工商所
