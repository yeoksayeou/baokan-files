Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 27th. Zhang Bojun, Peng Zemin, and Qiu Zhesan, leaders of the Chinese Peasants' and Workers' Democratic Party, issued a written statement on the 24th regarding the Nanjing puppet government's attempt to create a false peace conspiracy, as follows:
　　The reactionary ruling clique in Nanjing, under the threat of impending total destruction, had the bandit chieftain Chiang Kai-shek issue a so-called statement of seeking peace and self-preservation on New Year's Day this year; subsequently, the puppet Executive Yuan presumptuously announced a resolution for unconditional ceasefire on January 19th; recently, after Chiang Kai-shek feigned stepping down and arranged a scheme to revive his influence, the puppet Executive Yuan again appointed so-called peace talk representatives; at the same time, the puppet Acting President Li Zongren also issued a statement to end the war and seek peace, and launched divisive peace overtures to relevant parties. We believe that this series of deceptive actions is a manifestation of the consistent trickery performed by Chiang and the United States. We have been taught countless times in the past during the old Political Consultative Conference peace talks. Today, the Chinese people will never be fooled again. No matter how desperately the reactionary rulers in Nanjing wail and beg for mercy, they will never get a chance to revive. Chairman Mao Zedong of the Communist Party of China put forward eight peace proposals on January 14th, which are the common demands of the people of the whole country and the only way to achieve lasting peace in China. If there are elements in the reactionary clique in Nanjing who repent, and truly want to preserve the nation's vitality and leave a chance for the people to survive, they should immediately implement peace in accordance with Chairman Mao's eight proposals. We firmly believe that the peace the Chinese people yearn for is lasting peace, and the democracy they yearn for is the democracy of the people. If the reactionary Nanjing clique, which represents the interests of imperialists, feudal forces, and bureaucratic capital, is not thoroughly eliminated, then the Chinese people will have no way to obtain genuine peace and democracy. Therefore, we must call on the people of the whole country to truly understand the truth of the false peace that the Nanjing puppet government wants to create, and to expose and severely crack down on conspiracies at any time and any place. A journey of a hundred miles is only half completed at ninety. All counter-revolutionary, anti-democratic, and false peace elements must be thoroughly eliminated, so that they will never have the opportunity to bring disaster to the people.

　　中国农工民主党领袖
  　揭露南京伪政府假和平阴谋
    【新华社陕北二十七日电】中国农工民主党领袖章伯钧、彭泽民、丘哲三氏，于二十四日对于南京伪政府企图制造伪和平的阴谋，发表书面谈话如次：
    南京反动的统治集团，因迫于快要遭遇全部灭亡的威胁之兆，由匪首蒋介石于今年元旦发表所谓求和自保的声明；继由伪行政院于一月十九日妄自宣告无条件的停战的决议；最近，蒋匪伪装下野，布置借尸还魂的诡计以后，伪行政院复行指定所谓和谈代表；同时，伪代总统李宗仁又发表弭战谋和的谈话，并纷向有关各方进行分化性的和平试探。我们认为这一系列的欺骗行动，都是表现着蒋美一贯出演的技俩。我们在过去旧政协的和谈中，曾受到无数次的教训。在今天，中国人民断断不会再行上当。南京反动的统治者纵然百般哀鸣求饶，亦决不会得到死灰复燃的机会。中国共产党主席毛泽东先生曾于一月十四日提出八项和平主张，这就是全国人民共同的要求，实现中国永久和平之唯一的办法。南京的反动集团中，如果有悔祸的分子，真正为国家保存元气，为人民留一线生机，就应当立即依照毛先生的八项主张来实现和平。我们深信，中国人民所渴望的和平，是永久的和平，所渴望的民主，是人民的民主。假使对于代表帝国主义者的利益封建势力和官僚资本的南京反动集团，尚不肯加以彻底的消灭，那末，中国人民将无从获得真正的和平与民主。以此，我们要呼吁全国人民，须切实明了南京伪政府所要制造假和平的真相，要随时随地揭发奸谋，予以严重的打击。行百里者半九十，对于一切反革命反民主假和平的分子，都要给以干脆的肃清，让他们永远没有为祸于人民的机会。
