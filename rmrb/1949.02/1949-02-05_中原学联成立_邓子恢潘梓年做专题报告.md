Xinhua News Agency, Central Plains, 3rd: The first representative conference of the Central Plains Liberated Area Student Federation, which began on the 13th of last month in Kaifeng, successfully concluded on the 23rd, after completing major tasks such as determining the direction of the student movement in the Central Plains Liberated Area and establishing the Central Plains Liberated Area Student Federation. A total of 124 representatives from 47 units, including the Yu-Wan-Su, Yu-Xi Administrative Regions, and the cities of Kaifeng, Zhengzhou, and Luoyang, attended the conference. The conference lasted ten days, during which Deng Zihui, Deputy Political Commissar of the Central Plains Military Region of the Chinese People's Liberation Army, and Pan Zinian, Vice President of Zhongyuan University, gave special reports on "The Learning Tasks of Young Students" and "The Future Direction of the Student Movement," respectively. Deputy Political Commissar Deng pointed out: "The purpose of young students' learning is to prepare to be masters of the new China. Therefore, they must learn culture, politics, scientific knowledge, and various technologies. But the most important thing is to establish a revolutionary stand of serving the people and a realistic revolutionary style in learning." He also said: "The so-called serving the people mainly means serving the workers and peasants, serving the working people. Young students should not only establish this point of view in their thinking, but also implement it in practical actions. For example, if their family is a landlord, and a dispute arises between the family and the peasants, they should stand on the side of the peasants and safeguard the interests of the peasants. The so-called realistic style is not to aim too high, be arrogant, or start from fantasy, but to start from reality in everything, train in practical actions, and learn from the workers and peasants, learn from the masses." Vice President Pan called on the students to unite closely, distinguish between the boundaries of revolution and counter-revolution, participate in the People's Liberation War and various tasks of developing production, and help schools implement new educational policies. When student representatives from various places spoke at the meeting, they angrily denounced the oppression and persecution of Central Plains students by the Kuomintang bandit gangs and American imperialism. Li Haoran, a student representative from Nanyang, said: During the period when Wang Lingyun, director of the 13th Pacification District of the Kuomintang, occupied Nanyang, he specially set up a "Special Criminal Court" to persecute students, and students were often buried alive at night. When Bandit Wang fled Nanyang, he abducted more than 2,300 students and 150 teachers, most of whom were forced to join the bandit army as soldiers. Liu Suqian, a student from Jingyi Girls' Middle School, a Christian church in Kaifeng, said: In the church school she attended, students were deprived of their freedom. People from the American monastery used the excuse of checking for lung diseases to flirt with female students. During the "May 25th" student movement in 1947, an American imperialist-hired monk locked all the students in the auditorium and forbade them from going out to participate. After hearing these accusations, the student representatives unanimously passed the proposal "Accusing the Kuomintang reactionaries of persecuting young people to the world." After heated and solemn discussions, the representatives also passed the "Working Program of the Central Plains Liberated Area Student Federation" and the "Constitution of the Central Plains Liberated Area Student Federation." Finally, the conference elected Zhang Songhuo, representative of Zhongyuan University, Fang Zitian, representative of Yu-Xi Administrative Region, and Wang Huanan, representative of Zhengzhou City, and ten others as executive committee members of the Central Plains Student Federation, formally establishing the Central Plains Student Federation. At the same time, Ding Li of Kaifeng City and Wang Sheng of Yu-Xi Administrative Region were elected as representatives to the Central Plains Provisional People's Congress.

　　中原学联成立
  　邓子恢潘梓年做专题报告
    【新华社中原三日电】上月十三日起在开封举行的中原解放区学生联合会第一届代表大会，完成了确定中原解放区学生运动方针及成立中原解放区学生联合会等重大任务后，已于二十三日胜利闭幕。出席这次大会的代表计有：豫皖苏、豫西行政区和开封、郑州、洛阳市等四十七个单位，一百二十四人。会议历时十日，中国人民解放军中原军区副政治委员邓子恢和中原大学副校长潘梓年，分别在会上作了“青年学生的学习任务”与“今后学生运动方针”的专题报告。邓副政委指出：“青年学生的学习目的，是为了准备作新中国的主人，因此要学习文化，学习政治，学习科学知识，学习各种技术。但最重要的是在学习中确立为人民服务的革命立场，实事求是的革命作风”。他又说：“所谓为人民服务，主要就是为工农服务，为劳动人民服务。青年学生不仅要在思想上确立这种观点，而且要在实际行动上加以贯彻。如自己家庭是个地主，假如家庭与农民发生纠纷时，自己就应站在农民方面，去维护农民的利益。所谓实事求是的作风，就是不要好高鹜远，自高自大，不要从空想出发，而应一切从实际出发，在实际行动中锻炼，向工农学习，向群众学习”。潘副校长则号召同学们密切团结，分清革命和反革命的界限，参加人民解放战争和发展生产的各种工作，帮助学校实施新的教育方针。各地学生代表在会上发言时，曾愤怒地控诉了国民党匪帮和美国帝国主义对中原学生的压迫与残害。南阳学生代表李浩然说：国民党十三绥署主任王凌云盘踞南阳期间，专设“特种刑事法庭”迫害学生，经常有学生在晚上被活埋。王匪在逃离南阳时，并掳走学生二千三百余，教员一百五十人，后大部被强迫编入匪军当兵。开封市代表基督教会静宜女中学生刘素虔说：她上学的教会学校里，同学们被剥夺了自由权利。美国修道院的人借口检查肺病，向女同学进行调笑。一九四七年“五二五”学生运动时，一个美帝国主义御用的修道士把同学们都关在礼堂内，禁止同学外出参加。听了这些控诉的学生代表们，在会上一致通过了“向全世界控诉国民党反动派残害青年的罪行”的提案，代表们在热烈而郑重的讨论下，又通过了“中原解放区学生联合会工作纲领”和“中原解放区学生联合会章程”。最后，大会选出了中原大学代表张松火，豫西行政区代表方自天，郑州市代表王化南等十一人为中原学生联合会执行委员，正式成立中原学联。同时又选出开封市的丁力，豫西行政区的王声为出席中原临时人民代表大会的代表。
