Xinhua News Agency, Beiping, 20th. Under the leadership of General Ye Jianying and General Guo Zongfen, all members and staff of the Beiping Joint Office are working intensively to handle handover matters in an orderly manner, and to plan practical measures for reorganizing General Fu Zuoyi's troops according to democratic principles. Since its official establishment on the 1st of this month, the Joint Office has carried out the following main tasks in half a month:

(1) Stipulating formal procedures for handover work and carrying out the takeover. The Joint Office decided that before carrying out the takeover, the Beiping Military Control Commission of the Chinese People's Liberation Army should submit it to the Joint Office for approval. The Joint Office would then issue a formal letter of introduction, along with the takeover order from the Military Control Commission, before the takeover could proceed. As of the 16th of this month, in addition to the original Beiping municipal organs which have been completely taken over, the Materials Takeover Committee of the Military Control Commission has also taken over 543 units. These include public enterprises, telecommunications, transportation, postal services, railways, warehouses, military supplies, etc. The Cultural Takeover Committee has taken over 25 independent colleges, museums, libraries, and other units. In addition, 7 units of special forces have been taken over, totaling 575 units. In the vast majority of these units, the handover procedures were adequately prepared in advance, and the former personnel were at ease in their work. The formal takeover procedures stipulated by the Joint Office effectively prevented the chaotic phenomenon of takeovers in name only or takeovers that did not follow the prescribed procedures, ensuring that the above-mentioned takeover work was carried out in an orderly manner according to the original system.

(2) Deciding on supply methods for troops awaiting reorganization. From the 16th of this month, the supply of all troops awaiting reorganization is entirely the responsibility of the Pingjin Front Command of the Chinese People's Liberation Army. The supply standards are in accordance with the regulations of the Northeast People's Liberation Army. Firewood, rice, oil, salt, and meat are all issued in kind. In addition, each person receives 5 yuan in Renminbi per day for vegetable expenses. Other expenses are stipulated separately.

(3) Troops awaiting reorganization are to be organized in the city with regiments as the unit. When the People's Liberation Army entered the city, there were at least 325 units or more of troops awaiting reorganization in the city, with a total of approximately 30,000 people. Now, with the approval of the Joint Office, only 15 liaison offices will remain in the city, with an average of about 20 people per office, totaling less than 300 people. Each liaison office must register with the Beiping Garrison Command. As of the 16th, 12 units have completed the formalities.

(4) Stipulating the method for transporting warehouses in the city for troops awaiting reorganization. In the past, the total number of large and small warehouses for troops awaiting reorganization in the city was more than 200. Now, with the approval of the Joint Office, the materials needed by the troops awaiting reorganization are allowed to be transported out of the city from the warehouses for the supply of the troops, and the remainder will be received by the Logistics Department of the Military Control Commission. A list of the items transported out must be made, and the Logistics Department will issue a transportation permit. The gasoline required for transportation will be verified and issued by the Logistics Department. The items to be transferred will be counted by the Logistics Department according to the inventory. Currently, each liaison office is processing the procedures for transporting out or transferring items.

In the past half month, there have been some violations of discipline or procedural errors among the troops awaiting reorganization and the takeover and transfer personnel. However, due to the sincere and modest democratic discussions of the members of the Joint Office, as well as the tireless efforts of all the staff, these have been promptly corrected.

　　北平联合办事处紧张工作
    交接事宜有条不紊
    我已接管五百七十余单位
    【新华社北平二十日电】叶剑英将军、郭宗汾将军领导下的北平联合办事处全体委员和工作人员，正在为了有条不紊的办理交接事宜，以及计划依据民主原则改编傅作义将军所辖各部队的实际办法而紧张地工作着。联合办事处自本月一日正式成立以来，半个月中进行了以下几项主要工作：
    （一）规定交接工作的正式手续，进行接管。联合办事处决定在进行接管以前，先由中国人民解放军北平区军事管制委员会提交联合办事处会议通过，由办事处发给正式介绍函件，并携带军事管制委员会的接管命令，方可进行接管。截至本月十六日止，除原北平市政机关已经完全接管外，军管会物资接管委员会亦已接管了五百四十三个单位。其中包括公营企业、电讯、交通、邮政、铁路、仓库、军用物资等。文化接管委员会接管了独立各校院、博物馆、图书馆等二十五个单位。此外，又接管了特种兵团的七个单位，共计五百七十五个单位。其中绝大多数的单位，事先对于移交手续作了应有的准备，旧有人员亦安心地在工作。由于联合办事处规定了正式的接管手续，有效地防止了冒名接管或不按规定手续接管的混乱现象，保证了按照原来系统有秩序地进行上述的接管工作。
    （二）决定待编部队的供给办法。由本月十六日起，所有待编部队的供给，完全由中国人民解放军平津前线司令部负责。供给标准均按照东北人民解放军的规定，柴、米、油、盐、肉一律发给实物。另外，每人每日发给菜金人民币五元。其他经费另有规定。
    （三）待编各部队，以军为单位集中组织城内留守处。在人民解放军入城时，待编各部队在城内的机关至少有三百二十五个单位以上，人数约三万余人。现经办事处会议通过在城内只留十五个留守处，每处平均约二十人，总数不到三百人。各留守处均向北平警备司令部办理备案手续。至十六日止，已办完手续者计有十二个单位。
    （四）规定待编部队城内仓库的运交办法。过去待编部队在城内的大小仓库，总数在二百个以上。现经办事处会议决定，待编部队需要的物资准许自仓库运出城外供给部队使用，其余交由军事管制委员会后勤部接收。运出的物品，开具清单，经后勤部发给运出证，运输所需汽油由后勤部核发。移交的物品则根据表册由后勤部点收。现各留守处正在办理运出或移交的手续中。
    在过去半个月中，待编部队和接管、移交人员，曾经发生过某些违反纪律或手续错误的现象，但由于联合办事处各委员诚恳虚心地民主讨论，以及全体工作人员的不倦努力，都已及时地予以纠正。
