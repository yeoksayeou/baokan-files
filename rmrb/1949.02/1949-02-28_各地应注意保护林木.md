　　All Regions Should Pay Attention to Protecting Trees
　　Protecting trees is an important link in long-term construction and the development of agricultural production. It is necessary to draw attention to the following points:
　　1. Last spring, when the Taihang Second Special Administrative Region planted trees in various places, they found tree seedlings extremely difficult to obtain. However, by examining the shortcomings in past work and through the efforts of cadres and the masses, they achieved considerable results. According to incomplete statistics from six counties in October, a total of 591,155 trees were planted. Of these, 161,327 withered or were damaged, accounting for 72.71% of the total number of trees planted in the region. The number of trees that survived exceeded any previous year. However, some of the masses and certain cadres have not recognized the importance of long-term tree protection. Many areas have neglected forest protection. For example, in Zuoshi Village, a total of 266 trees were planted last year, of which 170 were eaten by livestock, 47 were pulled out, and 3 died, totaling 220 damaged trees, accounting for 82.7%. This number is very alarming, and there are many similar cases. If large trees are cut down in other areas every year and small trees cannot survive after planting, it will be impossible to develop afforestation.
　　2. Although indiscriminate logging has basically stopped in mountain forests, some places are still damaging the forests. For example, in the Xiwuchuan area of ​​Xiyang, many people secretly cut timber in Jingshang Village, Heshun County. Also, in the Niutianjiagou area, especially in Shangyang, Hanhu, and Cuishangzhuang villages, only pine forests are protected, while other miscellaneous forests are severely damaged. If miscellaneous forests are not protected, large areas of miscellaneous forests in the area will be destroyed.
　　3. There are too few forestry and animal husbandry cadres. For example, the Yushe Farm had only one worker兼technician for a period of time last year. The cadres of the Heshun Forestry Farm are all responsible for the key work of a cooperative. The Wuxiang Farm is busy with textile work. The leadership has neglected forestry and animal husbandry work, and most of the nurseries are deserted. In particular, the government of the Second District of Heshun not only did not lead the nursery work, but planted fennel in the nursery stationed in the village (Boli Village), which aroused dissatisfaction among the masses, who directly reflected to the cadres of the County Forestry Farm, saying: "Who dares to plant fennel in the nursery except the district (referring to the district government)!?"
　　Based on the above situation, it is therefore suggested that the cadres who lead work in the various counties and districts, especially the cadres who work in forestry, animal husbandry, and farms, should carry out propaganda and mobilization work among the masses, strengthen the protection of newly planted trees, combine firewood collection before spring with the repair of mountain forests, protect pine forests and miscellaneous forests, collect tree seeds early, and prepare for nursery sowing.

### 各地应注意保护林木

专栏：批评与建议

　　各地应注意保护林木
    保护林木是长期建设与发展农业生产的重要一环，必须引起以下观点注意的必要：
    一、去春太行二专署各地植树时，感到树秧极困难，但由于检查了过去工作中的缺点，及干部群众的努力得到了不少的成绩，在十月份各县植树据六个县的不完全统计：共植树五十九万一千一百五十五株，枯死与损坏者十六万一千三百二十七株，占全区植树总额的百分之七十二点七一，成活者超过了以往任何一年。但还有部分群众及某些干部没有认识到长期保护林木的重要性，许多地区忽视了护林，如左石匣村，去年共植树二百六十六株，被牲口啃吃了的就有一百七十株，拔了的四十七株，死了的三株，共损坏二百二十株，占百分之八十二点七，这个数字是非常惊人的，而且其类此比例者也还不少。象这样每年大树砍他地区了，小树又栽不活，是没法开展造林事业的。
    二、山林方面虽然基本上停止了乱砍乱伐，但有些地方仍对山林有所破坏：如昔阳西五川一带，有不少群众到和顺京上村偷砍木材，又如牛田家沟一带，特别是上阳、寒湖、崔上庄等村，只是保护松林，对其它杂林则大肆破坏，如再不对杂林加以保护，该区的大片杂林将要灭绝。
    三、林牧干部太少，如去年榆社农场有一个时期只留下一个工人兼技术员，和顺林场干部都负责一个合作社重点工作，武乡农场都忙于纺织工作。领导上忽视了林牧工作，荒芜了大部分苗圃，特别是和顺二区区政府不但没领导苗圃工作，反而把驻村（泊里村）的苗圃种了茴子白，引起了群众不满，直接向县林场干部反映说：“除了区上（指区政府）谁敢把苗圃种了茴子白呀！？”
    根据以上情况，因此建议各县区领导工作的干部同志，特别是作林牧及农场工作的干部，要在群众中进行宣传动员工作，加强保护新植林木，春前的空隙结合打柴做到修整山林，保护松林与杂林，及早收集树籽，准备苗圃下种。
