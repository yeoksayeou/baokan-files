Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, February 12th: In view of the impending completion of the Ten-Year Plan for the Construction of Moscow, the Council of Ministers of the Soviet Union and the Central Committee of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union issued an order at the end of January to formulate a new plan for the construction of Moscow for a period of twenty to twenty-five years. According to TASS, since the implementation of the Moscow Ten-Year Construction Plan of 1936-1945, a huge project for the construction of Moscow's economy and the city's thoroughfares and squares has been completed. The plans in the ten-year plan for the development of gas supply, the construction of underground railways and bridges have been completed and exceeded. However, plans for drinking water supply, drainage equipment, urban transportation, embankment construction, road improvement, and the development of schools and other social services have not been realized due to the war. Now, Moscow's economy has recovered to pre-war levels, and it has the prerequisites for realizing the above-mentioned plans. The above plan will be completed in the next three to four years. In view of this situation, the Council of Ministers of the Soviet Union and the Central Committee of the All-Union Communist Party (Bolsheviks) ordered the Moscow Soviet and the Moscow City Committee of the All-Union Communist Party (Bolsheviks) to formulate an outline of a new 20- to 25-year construction plan for Moscow and submit it to the Council of Ministers and the Central Committee for consideration before October 1. The order instructed: This construction plan must be scientifically formulated and should reflect the powerful upsurge of the Soviet national economy, science and culture.

    应反映苏联各种建设的强大上升
    【新华社陕北十二日电】鉴于苏联首都莫斯科十年建设计划行将完成，苏联部长会议及苏联共产党中央于一月底发布制定一个为期二十年至二十五年建设莫斯科的新计划的命令。据塔斯社讯，自从一九三六——一九四五年莫斯科十年建设计划实行以来，建设莫斯科市经济及全市通衢大道与广场的庞大工程，业已完成。十年计划中关于发展煤气供应、建筑地下铁道及桥梁的计划，均已完成并且超过。但其中关于饮水供应、排水设备、城市运输、筑堤、改进公路、发展学校及其他社会服务的计划，则因战争的原因，未能实现。现在，莫斯科市的经济已恢复到战前水平，已具备了实现上述计划的前提条件。上述计划将在今后三四年内完成。苏联部长会议及联共中央鉴于这一情况，特命令莫斯科市苏维埃及联共莫斯科市委会，拟定一个二十年到二十五年的莫斯科市新建设计划的大纲，并在十月一日以前呈交部长会议及联共中央考虑。命令指示：这一建设计划必须科学地拟定，应反映苏联国民经济、科学与文化的强大上升。
