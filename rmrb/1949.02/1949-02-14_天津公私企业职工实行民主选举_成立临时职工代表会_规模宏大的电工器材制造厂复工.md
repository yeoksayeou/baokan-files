Xinhua News Agency, Tianjin, February 12th: Public and private enterprises in Tianjin, such as the China Textile Construction Company, North China Steel Company, Central Machine Factory, Rubber Factory, and Ji'an Water Company, have successively established provisional workers' representative conferences. Some of these have already begun their work. For example, the workers' representative conference of the China Textile Third Factory, in addition to preparing for the celebration of liberation during the recent Lunar New Year, is now organizing literacy classes for female workers and resolving the issue of catering for single workers. The workers' representatives in each factory were democratically elected by the workers. Before the election, the Second Factory of the Steel Company defined the qualifications for representatives as: caring for the factory, being selfless, and genuinely working for the workers. Ji'an Water Company conducted the election by secret ballot. Those who could not write were assisted by others. The provisional workers' representative conference elected by the Transportation Office of the Municipal Public Utility Bureau included one representative each from staff, workers, escorts, and unloading workers. Therefore, the representative conference has broad representation.

Xinhua News Agency, Tianjin, February 12th: Among the factories and enterprises in Tianjin taken over by the Military Control Commission from the former Kuomintang government, the South, North, and West factories belonging to the Tianjin Electrical Equipment Factory, as well as the Tianjin Management Office Direct-Controlled Clothing Factory of the Kuomintang Joint Logistics Pingjin Clothing General Factory, have successively resumed production. The three factories of the Electrical Equipment Factory, except for the light bulb department of the South Factory, which was temporarily unable to start work due to damage from artillery fire, fully resumed production on the 2nd of this month. This factory is the largest electrical equipment manufacturing plant in North China. It was formed by the Kuomintang Resources Committee by merging eleven electrical appliance manufacturing units in the Pingjin area, including the North China Electric Wire Co., Ltd. and others, which belonged to the Japanese invaders. Currently, as it is gradually resuming production, most factories are engaged in organizing machinery and completing semi-finished products. In addition to assisting the Jibei Electric Power Tianjin Branch in repairing damaged transformers in the urban area, the West Factory workers have formulated a production plan for this month, intending to manufacture three transformers (two 500 kW and one 200 kW) and fifty to sixty electric motors (ten 3 horsepower and forty to fifty 15 horsepower) before the end of the month. The Tianjin Management Office Direct-Controlled Clothing Factory of the Tianjin Clothing General Factory officially resumed work on the 5th. The factory has a total of 2,756 employees and 1,422 sewing machines. In the past, it produced 2,500 sets of military uniforms per month, with each set including a military coat, two shirts, a military cap, and a pair of leggings.
