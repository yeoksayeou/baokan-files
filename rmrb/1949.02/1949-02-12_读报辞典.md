　　Mongolian People's Republic—Located to the north of China and south of the Soviet Union, it covers an area of 1.5 million square kilometers and has a population of approximately 800,000. The foundation of its national economy is animal husbandry, with agriculture playing a secondary role. In recent years, industry has also been developing. The capital, Ulan Bator (Chinese translation: Kulun), is located in the central-northern part of the country. In the past, it was consistently subjected to discrimination and oppression by the "Great Han Chauvinism" of the Chinese reactionary government. Between 1920 and 1924, the Mongolian people, in pursuit of their own liberation, formally established the Mongolian People's Republic. It was not until October 30, 1945, when the Mongolian people held a plebiscite, with 100% of the citizens voting in favor of independence, that the Kuomintang reactionary government was forced to recognize its independence.
