　　Xinhua News Agency, Peiping, February 25th: The People's Liberation Army, having completed the task of liberating Peiping and Tientsin, is beginning political rectification in the Peiping-Tientsin area. All units have formulated specific rectification plans based on the spirit of the Northeast Field Army's political work conference and the actual conditions of their respective units. The consistent central educational content in all unit plans is to implement the ideological education of carrying the revolution through to the end, expose the war criminals' conspiracy for peace, and at the same time, overcome harmful thoughts such as being calculating and pleasure-seeking, fearing hardship, wanting to be lazy, talking emptily about victory, and underestimating the enemy and being arrogant, which arise in victory. The method is generally prepared to start with enlightenment and grievance-airing, and then check thoughts, raise political consciousness, and strengthen the determination to carry the revolution through to the end. In the steps of implementation, preparation and mobilization come first. For example, a certain unit decided to prepare teaching materials and maps in advance, and hold cadre meetings, party member meetings, meritorious service meetings, soldier representative meetings, etc., to carry out mobilization. When the formal rectification begins, cadres come first, then soldiers. A certain unit plans to hold training classes mainly for political cadres at the division level, for a period of ten days. At this time, the company will carry out mobilization and general current affairs education. After the first phase of training is completed, those cadres will lead the company to deliberate on grievance-airing and conduct current affairs education. After the second phase of training is completed, the cadres of the military, division, and regimental levels and all company cadres will lead the company to universally carry out rectification. A certain unit specifically proposed in its plan that the following two points should be paid attention to in the rectification work: 1. The organization and leadership of rectification should be centered on the Party committee, with timely deployment, mobilization, inspection, and summary. Inspection should go deep into the company. 2. Military and political cadres should work together and be jointly responsible, instead of relying solely on political organs to do it.
　　
　　Xinhua News Agency, North China, February 24th: A certain unit of the North China People's Liberation Army held a victory celebration in the suburbs of Peiping at the beginning of the month to celebrate the large number of people's heroes and meritorious units that emerged in the Xuanhua, Zhangjiakou and other battles. The leaders of the unit participated and awarded medals and flowers to the heroes and meritorious units who had made great contributions, and called on the heroes and all the commanders and fighters to make persistent efforts, not to be arrogant, not to underestimate the enemy, and to continue to make contributions to the people. The heroes of each unit spoke one after another, all expressing their guarantee to fight more heroically in the future, abide by policies and discipline, and make even greater contributions.
