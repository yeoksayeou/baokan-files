    Moscow—The capital of the Soviet Union, located in the center of the Soviet Union, spans the Moscow River, a tributary of the Oka River. It covers an area of 285 million square meters and is the political, economic, cultural, and transportation center of the Soviet Union. Densely populated and magnificently constructed, it is the area where the nation's essence converges and also the world's largest scientific center. The famous Marx, Engels, and Lenin Institute are located here, as are many Soviet universities and the largest Lenin Library. The famous Russian artistic archetype—the Kremlin—stands in the city center, with tall and incomparably magnificent buildings. This place was originally the palace of the Tsars, built in the 17th century. After the victory of the October Revolution, it was repaired and is now the location of the Soviet central government organs. The tomb of the revolutionary teacher Lenin is also built on the side of the palace wall.
    Maurice Thorez—The Secretary-General of the French Communist Party, born in the Calais region in 1900. He was a miner in his youth, but later became a very learned man, with profound research not only in Marxism, economics, and sociology, but also great achievements in general academic culture. In 1920, he joined the French Communist Party and was one of the founders of the FCP. Early on, he served as the secretary of the Calais region's Communist Party and later was responsible for organizing the party's political bureau. In 1932, he was elected as a member of the French National Assembly. During World War II, after the fall of France, he organized underground armies in the country to carry out guerrilla warfare, inflicting significant blows on the German invaders and achieving brilliant results. After the German surrender and De Gaulle's resignation, Thorez was elected as the temporary Vice President of France. In the 1947 French general election, the FCP secured the most seats in the National Assembly, and Thorez served as Deputy Prime Minister in the Ramadier government.
    Fatherland Front—Is a united organization of democratic parties in Bulgaria. During World War II, the reactionary rulers of Bulgaria served as a small puppet of the fascist Axis powers of Germany, Italy, and Japan. In June 1942, various democratic parties—the People's Democratic Alliance, the Social Democratic Labor Party, the National Agrarian Union, and the Radical Party, under the leadership of the Bulgarian Workers' Party (Communist Party), formed the Fatherland Front under the victorious influence of the Soviet Red Army's defeat of German troops on all fronts. They called on the Bulgarian army to turn their guns around, and called on the Bulgarian people to organize guerrilla units to fight against the fascist German army and protect the motherland. In September of the same year, the Fatherland Front organized the Bulgarian democratic government and officially declared war on Germany. In the spring of 1948, the Congress of Representatives of the Fatherland Front officially passed the organizational charter of the Fatherland Front, stipulating that the Fatherland Front is an alliance of all anti-fascist, democratic, and progressive fighting forces in Bulgaria, based on the alliance of the working class, laboring peasants, handicraft workers, and progressive intellectuals. Anyone who holds a position in any institution of the Fatherland Front, regardless of party affiliation, nationality, religion, or social status, can be a member of the Fatherland Front.
    Rangoon—Is the largest port in Burma and also the capital of Burma. Located on the banks of the Rangoon River in the Irrawaddy Delta. It has a population of 500,000, including more than 30,000 overseas Chinese. It is a typical colonial city: commerce is very developed, and there is also a considerable amount of industry, but whether it is rice milling, oil extraction, mining, timber manufacturing, or the transportation and sale of these things, they are all controlled by British capitalists. Burma is a market and source of raw materials for Britain, and Rangoon has become the economic and political control center for Britain in Burma. The most important British investment in Rangoon is the Burma Oil Company. According to statistics from 1937, Britain could ship 300 million gallons of oil back from Burma each year. In addition, British investments in rice mills and sawmills also occupy an important position. There is a "Shwedagon Pagoda" here, which is a world-famous building. It is said that the pagoda began to be built more than 2,500 years ago, and then it was gradually rebuilt. The current Shwedagon Pagoda is 1,200 meters high, 4,470 meters in circumference, and is entirely gilded. It can be seen from dozens of miles away. Legend has it that the remains of Sakyamuni Buddha are placed at the bottom of the pagoda, so Buddhist believers in Southeast Asian countries regard this pagoda as a sacred symbol.
    Mandalay—Also known as Yadanabon, is located in central Burma, on the east bank of the Irrawaddy River, 600 kilometers by water from Rangoon. Steamships travel conveniently between the two cities. This city was the old capital of the Kingdom of Burma from 1860 to 1885. The city streets are located on the hills of the Irrawaddy Plain. Transportation is convenient, commerce is prosperous, and it is a famous city in Burma.
    Sardinia—This island belongs to Italy, in the west of Italy, bordering the Tyrrhenian Sea to the east, facing the French-controlled Corsica to the north, and embracing the Strait of Bonifacio in the middle. It has an area of 24,056 square kilometers and is the second largest island in the Mediterranean Sea. The island is mostly mountainous, and the land is quite fertile, with wheat as the main agricultural product.
