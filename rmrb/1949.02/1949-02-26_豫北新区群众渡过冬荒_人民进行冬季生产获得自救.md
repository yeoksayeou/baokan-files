(Taihang Electric) In the vast rural areas of the new districts of Jiaozuo, Xiuwu, Wuzhi, Huojia, and other counties in northern Henan, the laboring people have been mobilized to engage in winter production and self-salvation, closely combined with the movement to eliminate remnant bandits. From November of last year to mid-January of this year, significant achievements have been made in some areas. In addition to profits from transportation and textiles, according to incomplete statistics from four districts of Xiuwu, Wuzhi, and Huojia, a total of 244 handicraft industries and workshops have been restored and developed. In Xiuwu District One, which was liberated just after the end of October last year, more than 10,000 disaster victims included 1,400 people who immediately had no food to eat. However, as a result of organizing production for self-salvation, by the time of the solar New Year, 1,000 people had enough to eat and drink. In Xiguan of the same district, the number of people without food or drink had decreased from 96 to 7 by January 15th. In Jiaozuo County, more than 1,100 women from 27 villages helped each other in textile production, earning an average of six or seven large measures of grain per person in December of last year. The famine in the first, second, and seventh districts of Huojia is also gradually being alleviated. In the production and self-salvation movement of the past few months, the active support and specific leadership of the democratic government and cadres at all levels, as well as overcoming the concept of mere relief, have played a decisive role. In addition to allocating grain and funds for loans to the vast number of people who were unable to produce or who were living in poverty, and assisting them in production, Huojia also enlightened the masses to accuse Chiang Kai-shek's bandits of destroying production and causing the people to die. From their own experience and comparison, they more deeply recognized the Communist Party's policy of "seeking welfare for the people's production and life," and enthusiastically responded to the Party and government's call for "production and self-salvation," breaking the idea of simply waiting for government relief and starting to take action. At the same time, it also specifically helped the vast number of farmers to study and solve the difficulties in production methods, further boosting the confidence of the masses in production and self-salvation. In Dengzhuang and Shiziying villages in the county, out of more than 300 households, 273 households engaged in transportation, textiles, and other production activities. In Xinzhuang and Yangwa, more than nine-tenths of the households in the entire village made and sold tofu to make a profit and overcome the famine. Secondly, the people in the extremely severely affected new districts, under the leadership and assistance of our Party and the democratic government, and through the propaganda and mobilization of cadres, the masses who had lived in the old liberated areas, and early-awakened activists, some of the masses have initially recognized the importance of organizing production from their experience of overcoming the disaster. In Jiaozuo, more than 1,100 women from 57 villages organized 172 textile groups, earning an average of more than two liters of grain per person per day. Furthermore, in some areas, due to extensive and in-depth propaganda and the correct implementation of production, loan and other policies, the ideological awareness of the masses has been raised, and they deeply believe that the above policies of our Party are for their benefit. They have shattered the shameless rumors and sabotage activities of special agents, such as "Whoever spins more flowers will have taxes levied by the Eighth Route Army," consolidating and improving the masses' enthusiasm for production and self-salvation.

　　豫北新区群众渡过冬荒
  　人民进行冬季生产获得自救
    【太行电】豫北焦作、修武、武陟、获嘉等县新区广大农村，紧密结合肃清残匪运动，发动劳动人民进行冬季生产自救，从去年十一月至今年一月中旬止，若干地区已获重要成绩。除运输、纺织获利外，据修武、武陟、获嘉四个区不完全统计，恢复与发展了手工业、作坊等共二百四十四座。修武一区去年十月下旬刚解放后，万余灾民即有一千四百人当下没饭吃、但由于组织生产自救结果，至阳历年前，已有一千人有了吃喝；该区西关至一月十五日，没吃喝者已由九十六人减至七人。焦作县二十七个村一千一百余妇女互助纺织，去年十二月份平均每人赚粮六七大斗。获嘉一、二、七区的灾荒亦在日益减轻。在数月来的生产自救运动中，民主政府及各部门各级干部的积极扶助与具体领导，并克服救济观点，起了决定性的作用。除拨发粮款借贷给广大无力生产或生活贫苦的人民，扶助其进行生产外，获嘉并曾启发群众控诉蒋匪破坏生产致人民于死地等罪行，使其从亲身体验对比中，更深刻的认识了共产党“为人民生产、生活谋福利”的政策，热烈响应党和政府“生产自救”的号召，打破单纯等待政府救济的思想，开始行动起来。同时，又具体帮助广大农民研究解决生产门路的困难，更鼓起群众生产自救信心。该县邓庄、狮子营两村三百多户，有二百七十三户投入运输、纺织等生产中；辛庄、杨洼全村十分之九以上的户做豆腐营利渡荒。其次。灾荒极其严重的新区人民，在我党与民主政府的领导扶助下，以及干部与曾在老解放区住过的群众和觉悟早的积极分子的宣传动员、串通活动下，部分群众已由渡灾的体验中，初步认识了组织起来生产的重要性。焦作五十七个村一千一百余妇女，组织了一百七十二个纺织小组，平均一人一天赚粮二大升多。再次，有些地区由于广泛深入宣传及正确执行了生产、贷款等政策，群众思想觉悟已提高，深信我党上述政策是为他们谋利的，粉碎了特务分子“谁纺花纺的多了，八路军要抽税”等无耻谣言破坏活动，巩固与提高了群众生产自救情绪。
