　　North China People's Government
    Political Department of the North China Military Region
    Joint Notice
    Unifying the Treatment of Old, Weak, and Retired Personnel
    [This Dispatch] The North China People's Government and the Political Department of the North China Military Region issued a joint supplementary notice on January 24 regarding the implementation of the treatment measures for elderly, infirm, and retired personnel, stipulating the following: 1. Those who joined the military but did not complete demobilization procedures and then transferred to local work shall be regarded as local staff. When they retire in the future, demobilization procedures will no longer be required. The procedures should be handled in accordance with Article 4 of the North China Region's Measures for the Treatment of Elderly, Infirm, and Retired Personnel. Their respective organizations (equivalent to or above the county level; those below the county level shall be handled by their direct superior) shall directly introduce them back to their native county government for resettlement. The letter of introduction must certify when they joined the military, what position they held, when they transferred to local work, the reason for retirement, and the date of retirement. It should be prepared in triplicate: the first copy to be kept by the organization, and the second and third copies to be given to the retired personnel to be submitted to their native county government for verification. If there are no errors, the production subsidy shall be calculated and issued according to the provisions of Article 2, Item 4 of the retired personnel treatment measures. The county shall then affix its seal and indicate "Received," retaining the second copy for reimbursement and returning the third copy to the retired personnel as a memento (no separate retirement certificate will be issued). 2. Veterans who have not been demobilized but have transferred to local work may be introduced to the veteran management agency nearby for processing upon retirement, but no demobilization certificate will be issued. In addition to the preferential treatment for veterans, retirement procedures shall still be followed and retirement benefits enjoyed. 3. All retired personnel, regardless of whether they are from North China or elsewhere, shall have their production subsidies calculated and issued by their native county government in accordance with Article 4 of the North China Region's Measures for the Treatment of Retired Personnel, in order to achieve uniformity. The old method of disbursement by the original organization shall be abolished immediately. 4. The "heads of organizations" who approve retirement and return home, as mentioned in Article 1 of the North China Region's Measures for the Treatment of Retired Personnel, refer to heads of organizations at or above the county level who have the authority to approve and assign the retired personnel. It is hoped that all levels will pay attention when implementing this.
