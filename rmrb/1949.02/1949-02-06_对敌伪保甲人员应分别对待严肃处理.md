Short Commentary

　　According to today's report, in Baxian and Anci in Jizhong New Liberated Areas, all puppet Baojia personnel are retained indiscriminately, even those who have committed numerous evils and are deeply hated by the people, are allowed to participate in "office work," allowing them to continue to oppress the people and undermine work, which has aroused dissatisfaction among the local people. This erroneous practice of retaining all enemy-puppet personnel is said to exist not only in certain areas of Jizhong, but also in other newly liberated areas, which should arouse our serious attention.

    We must have a firm and clear policy on the enemy-puppet regime organizations and the treatment of enemy-puppet personnel. This policy is: all reactionary political organizations must be thoroughly destroyed; for general enemy-puppet personnel, the policy should be that the ringleaders must be punished, the coerced are not to be questioned, and those who perform meritorious service will be rewarded.

    Why should all enemy-puppet regime organizations be thoroughly destroyed? Because they are tools used by imperialism, feudalism, and bureaucrat capitalism to rule and oppress the people. The purpose of the revolution is to fundamentally overthrow this reactionary rule and replace it with a people's democratic dictatorship led by the proletariat and based on the worker-peasant alliance. The Baojia system is the grassroots organization of reactionary rule, so it must be abolished; Baojia personnel are appointed by the Kuomintang reactionary government, and are its henchmen and accomplices in ruling and oppressing the people, and should be subject to popular review, and those who are guilty should be punished. After review by the People's Liberation Army and the People's Government, retaining them separately to maintain social order is to give them an opportunity to atone for their crimes with meritorious service, but it is by no means to recognize that puppet Baojia personnel still have a legitimate status in the democratic regime, nor is it to write off the crimes committed by Baojia personnel in the past. This point must be clearly distinguished.

    In the specific handling of Baojia personnel, they must be treated differently: 1. Those few Baojia personnel who have committed heinous crimes and are hated by everyone should be punished according to law and must not be allowed to continue to work; 2. After the general Baojia personnel are retained, they must be ordered to report scattered soldiers and defeated bandits, collect scattered weapons, and take care of public houses, etc., so that they can atone for their crimes with meritorious service in their work; and they should be educated to start anew and serve the people humbly. They must not be allowed to swindle and deceive under the guise of being a worker, or to act like overlords; otherwise, once discovered, they will no longer be treated leniently. 3. The reasons and methods for retaining them should be explained to the masses, and the masses should be asked to supervise them at all times. If they are found to continue to oppress the people or have other illegal acts, they are allowed to report them at any time, and if the investigation proves to be true, they will be severely punished. This kind of differentiated treatment of enemy-puppet Baojia personnel according to different circumstances, and making them subject to the education and control of the People's Government and the supervision of the masses, is to safeguard the interests of the people in the new district, and also to give the enemy-puppet personnel a way to rehabilitate themselves. All newly liberated areas should grasp this principle and handle it carefully and seriously according to the specific circumstances. Cadres in Baxian, Anci, and other regions of Jizhong who have made the same mistakes should especially conduct self-criticism from the ideological and standpoints, raise their vigilance, and earnestly correct the above-mentioned errors.

### 对敌伪保甲人员应分别对待严肃处理

　　对敌伪保甲人员应分别对待严肃处理
    据今天报载，冀中霸县、安次新收复区对伪保甲人员不加分别地一概留用，即使作恶多端为人民所深切痛恨者，也让他们参加“办公”，任其继续欺压人民破坏工作，已引起当地人民的不满。这种对敌伪人员一概留用的错误作法，据说不只在冀中某些地区如此，其他新解放区也存在这种现象，应引起我们严重注意。
    对敌伪政权组织与对待敌伪人员，必须有坚定明确的政策。这个政策就是：对一切反动的政权组织，必须彻底予以摧毁；对一般敌伪人员，则应当是首恶者必办，胁从者不问，立功者受奖的政策。
    为什么一切敌伪政权组织要彻底予以摧毁呢？因为它是帝国主义、封建主义和官僚资本主义用以统治人民压迫人民的工具，革命的目的就是要从根本上打倒推翻这个反动统治，代之以无产阶级领导的工农联盟为主的人民民主专政。保甲制度是反动统治的基层组织，故必须废除；保甲人员是国民党反动政府指派的，是它统治人民压迫人民的爪牙和帮凶，应受人民审查，有罪者应受惩处。审查后经人民解放军与人民政府分别留用他们，维持社会治安，是给他们一个立功赎罪的机会，而决不是承认伪保甲人员在民主政权中还有合法地位，也不是将保甲人员从前所犯的罪恶一笔勾销，这一点必须分别清楚。
    对保甲人员具体处理上须分别对待：一、对少数罪大恶极人人痛恨的保甲人员，应依法惩处，决不能继续要他们办事；二、对一般的保甲人员留用之后，必须责令他们检举散兵溃匪，收集散落的武器，看管公共房屋等，使其在工作中立功赎罪；并应教育他们重新做人，低首下心为人民服务，决不准许借工作员的招牌，招摇撞骗，作威作福；否则一经查觉，再不宽大。三、应把留用的道理和办法向群众说明，并请群众随时监督他们，如发现他们继续欺压人民或有其他非法行为，准予随时告发，查明属实，定必严惩。这样对敌伪保甲人员根据不同情况分别对待，并使他们受到人民政府的教育管制与群众监督，是为了卫护新区人民利益，也是给敌伪人员以自新之路。各新解放区都应掌握这个原则，分别情况慎重严肃处理。冀中霸县、安次及其他地区犯同样错误的干部，尤应从思想上立场上加以检讨，提高警惕，切实改正上述错误。
