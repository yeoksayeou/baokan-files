　　The Stevedores of Zhifangtou

　　——Baoding Dispatch

　　Wang Dacheng

　　Zhifangtou, close to the South Gate of Baoding, is where most ships from the east stop to unload cargo. Many of Baoding’s poor citizens depend on carrying cargo here for a living, toiling on carts and ships day and night, regardless of wind or rain. One person can carry eight to ten bags of flour, weighing 320 to 400 *jin* (approximately 160 to 200 kilograms). However, due to exploitation by the head foremen and sub-foremen, their wages only allow them to barely subsist. What is even more pitiable is that during the Kuomintang occupation, transportation was cut off, industry and commerce collapsed, and these stevedores’ livelihoods were utterly destroyed.

　　The day after Baoding was liberated, the state-owned Dasheng General Store took the initiative to help them resume their work, providing them with daily loading and unloading of goods for the store. To take care of their lives, in addition to paying wages on time, they were also given credit for white oil, salt, etc., allowing them to gain a certain profit through sales. In this way, in addition to their own needs, they could generally support a family of four.

　　They regarded the state-owned store as their home. When there were no goods to load or unload, they cleaned the yard, guarded the warehouse, and if they saw a grain sack was broken, they would hurry to sew it up... One day it snowed, and workers Chen Wenbin, Zhao Sandong, and others got up early to sweep the snow. After sweeping, they went to move the grain sacks from under the mat shed in the yard. Store manager Wang said to them, “Old Zhao! Rest inside for a while before moving more, it's very cold.” Old Zhao said, “That won’t do, if the sun comes out later, the snow will melt and wet the grain.” As he spoke, he carried a grain sack, followed by the others, into the warehouse.

　　On the 11th, some of the workers went to the city's South Station and the Electric Light Company to load and unload goods, leaving nine people at home. Coincidentally, that day the higher-ups gave the Dasheng General Store the task of supporting the front lines, requiring the immediate transport of ninety large carts of public grain. The grain had to be carried out of the warehouse and transferred via pumps onto the carts. The task was arduous, but their enthusiasm for supporting the front lines made them forget their fatigue. Carrying grain sacks of nearly 200 *jin* (approximately 100 kilograms), they ran quickly. From sunrise, they worked until 11 p.m. before eating. The nine people, in one day, including pumping and loading, carried more than 167,700 *jin* (approximately 83.85 tons) of grain.

　　They often said privately, "The public treats us well, and we must live up to the public." When various military and government organizations came to Dasheng to buy a few bags of salt or a few barrels of oil, they automatically loaded and unloaded, refusing payment. When the organizations insisted on paying, they said anxiously, "Comrades! Our lives are entirely given by the Communist Party. We should contribute more to the public. Why would we take money for this little bit of effort?"

　　Currently, the stevedoring business is very good, and the number of workers has increased from twenty-five to thirty-seven. They are now preparing to organize a trade union and literacy classes.

　　止舫头的搬运工人
    ——保定通讯
    王大成
    止舫头，挨近保定南关，东来的船只多在这里止舫卸货。保定的贫苦市民多靠在这里搬运货物糊口，不管刮风下雨天，没晌没夜的奔波在车上、船上。一个人能扛八袋到十袋洋面，重三百二十斤到四百斤。可是他们所得工资，因被大工头小工头们剥削，只能维持个半饥半饱，更可怜的是国民党占着期间，交通断绝，工商倒闭，这些搬运工人的饭碗，干脆被打碎了。
    保定解放的第二天，国营大生总店就主动帮助他们复了业。每天给商店装卸货物。为了照顾他们的生活，除按时支给工资外，还赊给他们白油、食盐等，使其在贩卖中得到一定利润，这样一来，他们除了自己的缴用，一般还可以供养四口人的生活。
    他们把国营商店看成了家，没货物装卸时，打扫院子，看守仓库，见到粮包破了，就忙去缝好……。有一天下了雪，工人陈文彬、赵三东等七人早早起来就去扫雪，扫完后，又去抱当院席棚底下的粮包。商店王股长对他们说：“老赵！屋里歇歇再搬吧，怪冷的。”老赵说：“那可不行，一会太阳出来，雪一化把粮食都漏湿了。”说着，背着粮包一个跟一个的送进仓去。
    十一日那天，一部分工人到城南站上和电灯公司去起卸货，家里还剩了九个人。恰巧这天上级给了大生总店支前任务，要马上调运九十大车公粮，粮食要从仓库扛出来过泵装车。任务是繁重的，但他们支前的热情，忘掉了疲劳，近二百斤的粮包，背起来一溜烟的跑，从太阳一露头，直干到夜十一点才吃饭。九个人一天连过泵带装车，背粮十六万七千七百多斤。
    他们私下里常说：“公家待咱们好，咱们更要对得起公家。”各军政机关到大生买几包盐呀，买几桶油呀，他们都是自动装卸，不要工钱，当机关硬给时，他们着急的说：“同志！我们的生活完全是共产党给的，我们该给公家多出点力，凭这一点力气还要钱？”
    目前搬运生意很好，工人已由二十五人增到三十七人。现在正筹备组织工会和识字班。
