Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, 26th: The joint meeting of the Standing Committee members of the Shaanxi-Gansu-Ningxia Border Region Assembly, members of the Border Region People's Government, and representatives of the Jin-Sui Administrative Office, successfully concluded on the 17th of this month. In addition to unanimously approving major proposals such as the merger of the Jin-Sui Border Region with the Shaanxi-Gansu-Ningxia Border Region, the joint meeting also stipulated the basic tasks of the Shaanxi-Gansu-Ningxia Border Region government for this year, which are to continue to fully support the People's Liberation Army and strive for the early liberation of the Great Northwest. Under this general task, the joint meeting focused on discussing work related to supporting the front lines, developing production, and taking over new areas. The joint meeting believes that in the past year, although the military and civilians of the Shaanxi-Gansu-Ningxia Border Region and the Jin-Sui Border Region have been in extremely difficult circumstances, all kinds of work have been successful. First of all, land reform has been basically completed in the areas with a population of 3.6 million in the two regions, and the masses have been initially mobilized in the newly liberated areas. Secondly, in terms of production, 800,000 disaster victims in the two regions have basically survived the famine. On the above basis, agricultural production in the Shaanxi-Gansu-Ningxia Border Region has recovered to 70% of the level before the Kuomintang bandit army attacked Yan'an, and agricultural production in Jin-Sui has exceeded the output of 1946. The Shaanxi-Gansu-Ningxia and Jin-Sui Border Regions have also used a large amount of manpower and material resources to support the People's Liberation Army in repelling the attacks of the Jiang, Hu, Ma, and Yan bandit gangs, recovered Yan'an, liberated vast areas such as southern Shanxi, central Shanxi, eastern Suiyuan, and Huanglong, and wiped out a large number of enemies. In order to more effectively support the front lines, the joint meeting discussed issues such as war service, preferential treatment for the families of martyrs and revolutionary soldiers. The meeting approved the suggestions of deputies An Wenqin, Huo Zhu'san, and others on building the Dinghui Canal (a newly established county south of Yulin, under Zhenchuan County) and the Zhinü Canal (under Mizhi County). The meeting also made specific provisions for developing animal husbandry, increasing the production of industrial raw materials such as cotton and flax, running supply and marketing cooperatives well, and restoring and developing handicrafts.

　　陕甘宁边区会议闭幕
    【新华社延安二十六日电】陕甘宁边区参议会常期驻会议员、边区人民政府委员和晋绥行政公署代表联席会议，已于本月十七日胜利闭幕。联席会议除一致通过将晋绥边区与陕甘宁边区合并等重大提案外，并规定陕甘宁边区政府本年度的基本任务，为继续全力支援人民解放军，争取早日解放大西北。在此总任务下，联席会议着重讨论了支援前线、发展生产和接管新区等方面的工作。联席会议认为：过去一年，陕甘宁边区和晋绥边区军民虽在极端困难的情况下，各种工作都是有成绩的。首先两区拥有三百六十万人口的地区基本上完成了土地改革，新解放区初步发动了群众。其次，在生产方面，使两区八十万灾民基本上渡过灾荒。在上述基础之上，陕甘宁边区农业生产已恢复到国民党匪军进攻延安前的百分之七十的水平，晋绥农业生产超过了一九四六年产量。陕甘宁和晋绥边区并以大量的人力物力支援人民解放军击退了蒋、胡、马、阎等匪帮的进攻，光复了延安，解放了晋南、晋中、绥东、黄龙等广大地区，歼灭了大量敌人。为更加有力地支援前线，联席会议讨论了关于战争勤务、关于优待烈士家属和革命军人家属等问题。会议批准了安文钦、霍祝三等议员关于修建定惠（榆林以南新设县，镇川县属）渠、织女渠（米脂县属）的建议。会议并对发展牧畜、增产棉麻等工业原料、办好供销合作社、恢复与发展手工业等作了具体的规定。
