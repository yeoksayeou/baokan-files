Experiences in Organizing Study for District Cadres
    Liu Ziyu
    Currently, various regions have started paying attention to the study of cadres in their positions. Especially since winter, many places have organized spare-time schools for government offices or literacy classes. District cadres generally also have a demand for learning. On the one hand, the encouragement of the situation promotes the self-consciousness of cadres to study; on the other hand, some comrades do feel that their work is difficult because they are illiterate, and they realize that they cannot do without learning. However, in some places, it is believed that district cadres are scattered in the countryside and are too busy with work to take care of learning, and no attention is paid to organizational leadership. In addition, some district cadres themselves are not conscious enough in their studies, resulting in a laissez-faire attitude, or even no learning at all. Now, based on the experience of various counties in the Taihang Second District Committee in organizing district cadres to study, the following suggestions are made:

    I. Organizational Leadership: To organize district cadres to study, the first step is to establish a sound leading study organization. It is necessary to establish a study committee with unified leadership from top to bottom. The leading comrades of the county must participate personally, set an example, and organize district cadres to study in a planned and led manner. Under the county's general study committee, each district should organize a central group, such as a study guidance group, preferably composed of the district head, the branch committee secretary, the branch committee propaganda member, and the participation of active learners. It is necessary to conscientiously implement and carry out the study plan of the higher-level study committee and help promote and inspect the study of district cadres. Below the district, groups should be divided according to base villages, and the head of the base work team is also the head of the study group. In this way, meetings can be combined to study work, and learning can also be promoted. For example, the Fourth District of Xiyang held an expanded cadre meeting to study the conclusion of land reform, combined with work, and studied questions and answers on agricultural socialism, which solved many confused ideas of cadres such as absolute egalitarianism. And through this study, the old cadres' experience-based thinking of putting on airs and not learning theory was overcome, a learning system was established, and some even made learning plans. After the meeting, some comrades reflected: "This is stronger than staying in a training class!"

    II. Learning Methods. Generally, the following methods are adopted: 1. Combine the study of superiors and subordinates. In work, it is necessary to educate the masses and publicize policies. First, cadres must understand the content of this publicity and education. Otherwise, policies cannot be implemented, and the awareness of the masses cannot be raised. This time, He Shun first organized the study of district cadres in concluding land reform. The district cadres studied the branch textbook, the main points of winter propaganda, and the outline of mass ideological education issued by the prefectural committee propaganda department and other documents. After research and discussion, the district cadres clarified and improved themselves first, and then carried out branch education and publicized to the masses. Everything was easily solved and the work was smoothly carried out.
    2. Organize self-study and mutual assistance, and let district cadres and primary school teachers combine to study. This is a good way for district cadres working scattered in the countryside to study. For example, Zuoquan (i.e., Liao County) designated newspapers as the only content for district cadres to study. Illiterate or semi-literate comrades must recognize, be familiar with, and write the easy-to-understand and easy-to-remember headlines in the newspaper. Literate comrades must especially understand its content, select and record the main points, or participate in reading groups, or jointly study with the primary school teachers in the village where they are located. For problems that cannot be solved, they can be recorded and brought up to the central group for discussion and solution. The mutual assistance between district cadres and primary school teachers can use the method of learning from each other's strengths and teaching each other. Teachers can help district cadres learn culture, and district cadres can explain policies to teachers. In this way, questioning each other's doubts can not only achieve "teaching each other," appropriately cooperate with the work, but also overcome certain barriers between cadres and teachers in the past. Some teachers in Wu Xiang once reflected: "As long as district cadres and we study together, we are willing to suffer more in our work." This combination benefits both parties.
    3. Combination of quizzes and discussions: The purpose of quizzes is to promote cadres' learning and further clarify the content of learning. However, some places are simply testing for the sake of testing. As a result, those who know will know, and those who don't will not. This has formed formalism. He Shun combined quizzes with discussions in the November test. After the test, everyone discussed the correct answers, and the General Study Committee wrote the material, pointing out the advantages and disadvantages, and distributed it to each district for district cadres to discuss widely. In this way, even people who did not participate in the test can clarify the problem. Some comrades reflected: "It's worthwhile to test like this and then discuss it." In addition to discussions, Yu She also posted the results to the public, commended the good ones, and stimulated the bad ones. This also promoted learning.
    4. Combination of learning and work: That is, to learn what you do and to learn what you see. For example, Wu Xiang district cadre and illiterate Wang Laifa, Zhang Cunlin and other comrades used this method to learn. For example, when doing the work of concluding land reform, they recognized words such as: "Concluding Land Reform," "Compensation and Resettlement," "Organization," "United Production," etc. From recognizing single words, they gradually understood the meaning and application of the words. Even the letters that others gave them were used as their own learning materials, imitating writing, organizing words and sentences, and gradually improving their culture. After the Fourth District of He Shun organized cadres to study, a illiterate female cadre was able to write simple letters after two or three months of effort.

    III. Learning Content: Our learning should be planned and focused. We must avoid disorder and grasping at everything. Learning content can be roughly divided into: regular learning and specialized learning. The content of regular learning mainly includes newspapers, branch textbooks, and policy studies. Especially newspapers are the most convenient. Textbooks are available everywhere, and teachers are available everywhere. It can not only guide work but also improve culture. Over time, the knowledge gained will naturally become richer. Specialized learning: is to study one document specially within a period of time. Such as currently studying "A Brief History of Social Development" etc. During this learning period, in addition to referring to relevant documents, we generally do not greedily read other books, so as not to affect specialized learning. Otherwise, it is easy to form gluttony, and the result is "a flash in the pan", and nothing can be learned well.

    IV. Overcome Two Abnormal Attitudes in Learning: Currently, there are two serious incorrect ideas in cadre learning: One is acute disease! These comrades have high enthusiasm for learning at the beginning and are very energetic. They want to learn more and learn faster. As a result, "more haste, less speed" will inevitably lead to discouragement. After a few days, the new ones have not been learned, and the old ones have been forgotten. This phenomenon of "one day of sunshine, ten days of frost, stop and go" should be overcome. One is giving up learning! Afraid of losing face. These comrades often use the excuse that they are too busy to study to cover themselves. We believe that this is not the main reason; the main reason is the lack of awareness of learning. Because of this, the spirit of learning from others is poor. For example, some comrades do not want to ask others about problems they do not understand, for fear of losing face; and some old cadres say that "it is too late to learn art when old" and give up their learning. We should correct our learning attitude and correctly recognize that learning is the obligation of every party member and cadre and is related to the future of revolutionary victory. The above two attitudes and confused thoughts must be overcome.

　　组织区干部学习的经验
    刘子余
    现在各地对在职干部的学习，一般都已注意起来了。特别是冬季以来，有不少地方组织了机关业余学校，或文化补习班等。区干部一般也是有学习要求的，一方面由于形势的鼓舞，促进了干部学习自觉；另一方面确实有些同志因为不识字，工作感困难，也认识了不学习不行。但在有些地方，则认为区干部分散在乡下，工作忙顾不上学习，不注意组织领导，再加上有的区干部本身学习不够自觉，就形成自流，甚至不学习。现根据太行二地委区各县，组织区干部学习经验，提出以下几种：
    一、组织领导：组织区干部学习，首先是健全领导学习机构，必须建立自上而下统一领导的学习委员会，县的领导同志必须亲自参加，以身作则，有计划、有领导的组织区干部学习。在县的总学委会以下，各区应组织中心组，如学习指导组等，最好由区长、分委书记、分委宣传委员并吸收学习积极分子参加。要认真地执行与贯彻上级学委会的学习计划，并帮助推动检查区干部的学习。区以下应按基点村划分小组，基点工作组长即学习组长。这样相互结合，开会研究工作，同时可以推动学习。如昔阳四区开扩干部会议研究结束土地改革，结合工作，学习了关于农业社会主义问答，解决了干部绝对平均主义等不少糊涂观念。并经过这次学习，克服了旧干部摆老资格不学习理论的经验主义思想，建立了学习制度，有的还订了学习计划。会后就有些同志反映说：“这比住训练班还强哩！”
    二、学习方法。一般采取以下几种：１、使上下级学习结合，在工作中要教育群众，宣传政策，首先干部必须了解这种宣传教育的内容。否则，政策就不能贯彻，群众觉悟就无从提高。这次和顺在结束土地改革中，就首先组织了区干部的学习。区干部学习了支部教材、冬季宣传要点，及地委宣传部发的群众思想教育提纲等几个文件，经过研究讨论，区干部明确了，先提高了自己，再去进行支部教育，向群众作宣传，一切都迎刃而解，顺利的开展了工作。
    ２、组织自学互助，让区干部和小学教员结合学习，这对分散在乡下工作的区干部学习是一种好办法。如左权（即辽县）对区干部学习，即指定报纸为区干部学习的唯一内容，不识字或少识字的同志，对报纸上易懂易记的标题，必须认熟写会。识字的同志，尤必须了解其内容，并择录笔记其要点，或者参加读报组，或和所在村小学教员共同研究，对解决不了的问题，可记下来，待开会时提到中心组讨论解决。区干部与小学教员的互助，可用取长补短，互教互学的办法，教员可以帮助区干部学习文化，区干给教员讲解政策，这样互相质问疑难，不但可以做到“教学相长”适当的配合了工作，并且还可以克服过去干部与教员之间的某些隔阂。武乡有些教员曾反映说：“只要区干部和咱互相研究，在工作上多吃些苦咱也愿意。”这样结合，彼此都有好处的。
    ３、测验与讨论相结合：测验的目的，是为要推动干部学习与进一步明确学习内容。但有些地方是单纯为测验而测验，结果是会者自会，不会者仍不会，就形成了形式主义。和顺在十一月份测验时是和讨论结合，测验后由大家讨论出正确答案，并由总学委会写成材料，指出优点及缺点，发到各区，让区干部普遍展开讨论。这样即使不参加测验的人，也能明确问题。有的同志反映说：“象这样测验了，再来讨论可沾。”榆社测验后除讨论外，还放榜示众，表扬了好的，对不好的也能刺激起来。这样也推动了学习。
    ４、学习和工作结合：就是要做啥学啥，见啥学啥。如武乡区干部文盲王来法，和张存林等同志就用这种办法学习，如做结束土地改革工作，他们就认：“结束土地改革”，“补偿安置”、“组织”、“团结生产”，……等字眼。由认识单字，慢慢了解字义和应用。连把别人给他们的信，也当作自己学习材料，仿造写话，组织词句，逐渐提高文化。和顺四区组织干部学习以后，一个不识字的妇女干部，经过两三个月努力，现已能写简单的信了。
    三、学习内容：我们学习应有计划、有中心，千万要避免杂乱无章，抓一把的现象。学习内容大体可分为：经常学习与专一学习两种。经常学习内容主要学习报纸，以及支部教材与政策学等。特别是报纸，最为便利，到处有课本，随处有老师，既可指导工作，又可提高文化，日积月累，获得的知识自然就丰富了。专一学习：是在一个时期内专门学习一种文件。如当前学习“社会发展简史”等。在这个学习期内，除参考有关文件外，一般不贪看其他书籍，以免影响专一学习。否则，容易形成贪多嚼不烂，结果是“虎头蛇尾”，啥也学不好。
    四、克服学习中两种不正常态度：现在干部学习中，严重的存在着两种不正确思想：一种是急性病！这些同志一开始学习情绪很高，劲头很大，是要多学快学，结果是“欲速则不达”，必然灰心丧气，过几天，新的没学了，旧的也忘了。这种“一曝十寒，忽作忽辍”的现象，应该克服的。一种是放弃学习！怕丢人。这部分同志往往是借口工作忙不能学习来掩饰自己。我们认为这不是主要的；而主要的是学习不自觉，由于这样向别人学习精神就差了。如有些同志对自己不了解的问题，还不想问人，怕丢架子；还有一些老干部说什么“老不学艺”不搞啦等。就放弃了自己的学习。我们应把学习态度端正起来，正确的认识学习是每个党员干部的义务，是有关革命胜利前途问题。上述两种态度与糊涂思想必须克服。
