　　Lin County's Eighteen Village Cadre Party Members
  　Examine Erroneous Views on Women
    [Taihang News] When Lin County's Seventh District was arranging the conclusion of the third batch of land reform, it convened a meeting of all 442 Party members from eighteen villages, including 37 female Party members. This meeting specifically conveyed the future policy for mobilizing women, organized Party members to examine incorrect views on women, and identified the following points:

    I. There is a general underestimation of women, with the belief that women can only take care of children. One Party member from Honghe said: "I even look down on female cadres, it doesn't matter to me whether they are at meetings or not."

    II. All actions towards women are taken with a domineering approach. Eighteen branches reported that there was not a single village without instances of hitting women. The Director of the Dongpo Armed Forces Committee confessed that he beats his wife at least eight times a year. Every time after a fight, she doesn't spin thread properly for two or three days, and wastes food out of anger, which greatly damages household production. He finally stated his attitude that he would make a self-criticism among the women and admit his mistakes. The Honghe branch secretary was afraid that his wife would understand things and divorce him, so he did not allow her to attend meetings, and this time he also made a profound self-criticism.

    III. Utilizing viewpoints in women's work. Women are only mobilized when making military shoes, expanding the army, and handing over public grain, while other work is not valued.

    IV. Women's work is not done proactively, but is considered a task assigned by superiors, so meetings become a mere formality.

    Female Party members made self-criticisms for having reliance on others and for looking down on themselves. After the self-criticisms, it was unanimously agreed that these ideological viewpoints are the biggest direct obstacle to women's work. If they are not changed, it will be difficult to carry out women's work.

    Regarding future women's work, it was decided: I. First, the Party's leadership must be strengthened. This time, each of the eighteen branches will add a female branch committee member. In villages without female Party members or where female Party members cannot lead, the branch committee will assign one person to specialize in women's work.

    II. Mobilizing women cannot be done in isolation. The correct policy of women's liberation must be known to both men and women, and public opinion that fetters women with feudalism must be transformed. For example, two young women in Honghe used to be very active, but now their families won't let them out, so they have collapsed. A girl in Baiwen Village escaped her father's forced marriage and found a man herself, secretly running to the district office to get married. The villagers scolded her for being unruly, and the girl was so worried that she didn't dare go to her mother's house. These feudal social opinions must be broken.

    III. We must mobilize women patiently for a long time, understand the actual difficulties of women, such as household chores and children, and provide convenience, without pursuing formalism. For example, some villages in the past gathered women with children to spin thread together, which further affected women's work and led to failure. (Zheng Huilan)

　　林县十八个村干部党员
  　检查对妇女错误观点
    【太行讯】林县七区在布置第三批结束土改时，召开了十八个村全体四百四十二个党员的大会，其中有女党员三十七人。这次会议专门传达了今后发动妇女方针，组织党员检查对妇女不正确的观点，检查出有以下几点：
    一、普遍轻视妇女，认为妇女只能领小孩。洪河一个党员说：“我连妇女干部也瞧不起，开会时有无她们都中。”
    二、对妇女一切采取统治手段。十八个支部反映，没有一个村没有打妇女现象的。东坡武委会主任检讨，他每年最少打八次老婆，每次打架后，总有两三天不好好纺花，在作饭上也因怒浪费，对家庭生产有很大损害的。他最后表明态度，要在妇女中作检讨、认错。洪河支部书记怕老婆懂了事给自己离婚，不让她开会，这次也深刻作了检讨。
    三、在妇女工作上利用观点。每次在作军鞋、扩兵、交公粮时，才发动妇女，在其他工作上就不重视。
    四、作妇女工作不是主动去作，认为是上边布置，因此开会也就成了形式。
    女党员检讨有依靠思想，自己轻视自己。检讨后一致认为这几种思想观点，是直接阻碍妇女工作最大原因，如不转变，开展妇女工作是很困难的。
    对今后妇女工作研究确定：一、首先必须加强党的领导，这次十八个支部中都增加一个妇女支委，没有女党员或者女党员领导不起来的村，由支委分工，确定一人专门作妇女工作。
    二、发动妇女不能孤立进行，把妇女解放的正确方针使男女都知道，转变对妇女封建束缚的舆论。如洪河两个青年妇女，过去很积极，现在家里不让出门就垮下去了。百文村一个闺女逃躲父亲强迫婚姻自找男人，偷跑到区署结婚，村人骂不规矩，这个闺女也愁的不敢上娘家门。这些封建社会舆论必须打破。
    三、必须长期的耐心的去发动妇女，要体会妇女切身困难，家庭零活、小孩等，给以方便，不要追求形式。如有些村过去把有小孩妇女也集合在一块纺花，更影响妇女作活，越闹越垮台。　（郑蕙兰）
