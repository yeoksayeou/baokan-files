Taiyue Military Region Orders Subordinate Militia
Establish Weapon Storage System
    [Taiyue Electric] The Taiyue Military Region issued an order on the 25th of last month, instructing local militias to establish a system for regular storage and cleaning of weapons. The order stated: Since our region transitioned to a relatively peaceful and stable environment, some militiamen and even cadres have relaxed the safekeeping of weapons, and there have even been cases of weapon damage and loss. To cherish revolutionary weapons and prevent damage, the following regulations are established regarding weapon storage: First, all militiamen and cadres holding guns must clean their guns on time, specifically three times a month, on the 1st, 11th, and 21st of each month, they must clean all guns, weapons, and ammunition; village militia cadres are responsible for inspecting guns on the 1st of each month. Second, anyone found to have failed to clean their gun for three consecutive times will be punished, and those who clean their guns well will be commended. Third, among the village militia cadres, one person will be specifically responsible for weapon storage, inspection, and registration. Fourth, a weapon spot-check system will be established. Cadres from the military region down to the district level must check the weapon storage situation at any time when working in the villages. Those who are indifferent to this will be subject to severe criticism and warnings.

　　太岳军区训令所属民兵
  　建立保管武器制度
    【太岳电】太岳军区于上月二十五日发出训令，指示各地民兵建立经常保管、擦拭武器的制度。略称：自我区转入相对和平的安定环境后，有些民兵以至干部，放松了武器的保管，甚至还有损坏、遗失武器的现象。为了爱护革命武器，防止毁坏，因此规定了关于武器保管的几项制度如下：第一、不论任何持枪民兵及干部，都必须按时擦枪，确定为每月三次，逢初一、十一、二十一，必须进行擦拭一切枪支武器及弹药；各村民兵干部，要负责为每月初一验枪。第二、凡查出有连续三次不擦枪者，要给予处分，擦枪好的要进行表扬。第三、各村民兵干部中，责成一人专负武器保管、检查、登记之责。第四、建立武器抽查制度，上自军区，下至区干部，到村工作要不择时间检查武器保管情形。如有对此采取不关心的态度者，要受到严厉的批评和警告。
