Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 20th. TASS, New York: The prices of American grains fell again on the 15th. In Chicago, the price of wheat fell by more than one to more than four cents per bushel (approximately 3.4 *dou* in China), corn fell by 0.7 to 2 cents, and rye fell by 3 to 4.5 cents. The price index of agricultural products for the week ending February 8 fell by 20 points compared to February of last year. On the other hand, the number of bankruptcies of small companies has increased significantly. The private "Dun & Bradstreet" statistics office reported that 192 industrial and commercial companies went bankrupt in the week ending February 10, compared to 128 in the same week last year and 45 in the same week in 1947. Most of the industrialists surveyed by the "National Industrial Conference Board" expect a general economic decline this year.

　　美农产品价格
  　继续下跌
    【新华社陕北二十日电】塔斯社纽约讯：美国谷物的价格在十五日又跌。在芝加哥，每一蒲式耳（美制每蒲式耳约合我国三斗四升）的小麦价格跌了一分多到四分多，玉蜀黍跌了七厘到两分，裸麦跌了三分到四分半。至二月八日为止的一周中，农产品的价格指数比去年二月跌落了二十点。另一方面，小公司破产的数目已经显著地增加了。私营的“邓思·布勒得斯特里特”统计所报导称：在二月十日为止的一周间，有一百九十二个工商业公司破产了，而去年同周则为一百二十八个，一九四七年同周则为四十五个。“全国工业会议局”所调查的工业家中，大多数人预料今年将发生普遍的经济下降。
