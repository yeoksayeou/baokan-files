Xinhua News Agency, May 17th: According to the U.S. News Agency, the U.S. State Department issued a statement on the 15th, defending the U.S. government's policy of obstructing the realization of the Korean armistice.

The U.S. State Department's statement was issued amidst widespread condemnation by world public opinion of the U.S. obstruction of the Korean armistice negotiations. In recent days, due to the "counter-proposal" put forward by the U.S. side at Panmunjom threatening the future of the negotiations, this condemnation has developed to such an extent that British Prime Minister Churchill, Indian Prime Minister Nehru, and other public opinion clearly advocate that the eight-point proposal put forward by the Korean-Chinese negotiating delegation should be the basis for the armistice negotiation agreement.

In view of this situation, the U.S. State Department had to admit in its statement that the new proposal put forward by the Korean-Chinese side, which enabled the negotiations to resume, "put forward some foundations," and that the eight-point plan put forward by the Korean-Chinese side on May 7 "can be used as the basis for a glorious agreement." However, these words from the U.S. State Department were only intended to sugarcoat the U.S. "counter-proposal." The U.S. State Department's statement also downplayed the fundamental differences between the U.S. plan and the Korean-Chinese plan as merely "some amendments," saying: "On May 13, the United Nations Command accepted many of the opinions in the Communist side's most recent proposal (referring to the Korean-Chinese eight-point plan) as the basis for negotiations, and at the same time put forward some amendments to this plan in order to make the plan implementable."

The U.S. State Department is trying to make people believe that the U.S. "counter-proposal" is based on the Korean-Chinese eight-point plan. This is completely deceiving world public opinion. The Korean-Chinese side has repeatedly pointed out in recent days that the U.S. "counter-proposal" not only does not accept the Korean-Chinese eight-point plan as the basis for negotiations, but on the contrary, its basic policy is completely contrary to the Korean-Chinese eight-point plan. First, the Korean-Chinese plan advocates that all prisoners of war who are not directly repatriated after the armistice should be handed over to the Neutral Nations Repatriation Commission, while the U.S. "counter-proposal" advocates that Korean prisoners of war who are not directly repatriated after the armistice should not be handed over to the Neutral Nations Repatriation Commission, but should be "released on the spot," that is, handed over to Syngman Rhee; second, the Korean-Chinese plan advocates that the Neutral Nations Repatriation Commission should have sufficient conditions to carry out its duties, while the U.S. "counter-proposal" imposes various restrictions on the work of the Neutral Nations Repatriation Commission, making it impossible for this commission to exercise its functions and powers, and in reality placing it under the military control of the United States; third, the Korean-Chinese plan advocates that the parties concerned should have full freedom and convenience to conduct explanations to their non-repatriated prisoners of war, while the U.S. "counter-proposal" imposes extremely unreasonable restrictions on this explanation work, making this explanation merely a formality; fourth, the Korean-Chinese plan advocates that the handling of prisoners of war who have not been repatriated after the explanation period expires should be resolved through consultation by the political conference, while the U.S. "counter-proposal" opposes handing it over to the political conference for handling, but instead "releases them on the spot," that is, hands them over to Syngman Rhee or the Chiang Kai-shek bandit gang. From these differences, it can be seen that the U.S. "counter-proposal" not only did not accept the main points of the Korean-Chinese eight-point plan, but also overturned the basis for resuming negotiations, that is, the basis that all prisoners of war who are not directly repatriated after the armistice should be handed over to neutral countries for custody. The U.S. side has always expressed its agreement with this basis since the resumption of negotiations, but now it has gone back on its word.

The U.S. State Department's statement portrays the purpose of the U.S. "counter-proposal" as "to make the plan for the custody of non-repatriated prisoners of war practical and fair, to guarantee these prisoners of war, and at the same time to make the Communist side and the people of the world realize that whether prisoners of war go home is entirely up to them." In fact, the content of the U.S. "counter-proposal" completely fails to meet these goals. The provision in the U.S. "counter-proposal" to "release on the spot" Korean prisoners of war is the most unfair and violates the Geneva Convention, and it hands these prisoners of war over to Syngman Rhee before they can receive an explanation about their ability to return home. The U.S. "counter-proposal" places the non-directly repatriated prisoners of war and the working mechanism of the Neutral Nations Repatriation Commission in charge of these prisoners of war under the actual military control of the United States after the armistice, and their explanations are subject to various restrictions, which is not enough to eliminate the fear and doubt they have accumulated under the U.S. military's reign of terror for the past two years. How can this be said to be "guaranteeing" these prisoners of war? How can it be said that these prisoners of war can freely decide whether to return home? To put it bluntly, the purpose of the U.S. counter-proposal is by no means what the State Department statement says. The basic policy running through the U.S. "counter-proposal" is to forcibly detain Korean and Chinese prisoners of war, and its purpose is to undermine the basis for resuming negotiations and obstruct the swift reaching of an agreement in the armistice negotiations.

The U.S. State Department's statement attempts to portray the repeated delays and obstruction and the inconsistency of the U.S. negotiating representatives in the Panmunjom meeting tent as "trying to narrow the scope of the problem in order to give all prisoners of war the greatest guarantee and make the work of the Custodial Commission go smoothly." However, the fact is that except for the point of "trying to narrow the scope of the problem" being somewhat true, everything else is a complete lie. The U.S.'s "trying to narrow the scope of the problem" is to "try" to "narrow" the scope of prisoners of war who have not been directly repatriated who should be handed over to the Neutral Nations Repatriation Commission after the armistice, and to forcibly detain more than two-thirds of the captured personnel of the Korean People's Army who have not been repatriated; it is to "try" to "narrow" the functions and powers of the Neutral Nations Repatriation Commission and the freedom and convenience to explain to prisoners of war; it is not to hand over the handling of prisoners of war who have not been repatriated after the expiration of the explanation period to the political conference for resolution, in order to forcibly detain them and "narrow" the number of repatriated prisoners of war. However, all these "narrowing" results have destroyed the basis for resuming negotiations, have widened the differences that originally tended to narrow between the negotiating parties in the steps, time, and methods of repatriating prisoners of war, and have made it impossible for the armistice negotiations to reach an agreement quickly.

The U.S. State Department said in its statement that the U.S. opposes "using force to coerce prisoners of war who refuse to go home to return home" and opposes prisoners of war from being "detained and guarded indefinitely." But in fact, the Korean-Chinese side has never advocated "forcible repatriation," while the U.S. side is precisely going to implement on-the-spot release of Korean-Chinese prisoners of war in the U.S. military-controlled South Korean area, which is the real "indefinite detention and guarding," which is also the forced detention it has always advocated and implemented.

The U.S. State Department's statement said: "The prisoner of war issue is not a technical issue, but a fundamental issue in the free world's philosophy of individual dignity and rights. Free people cannot and will never agree to regard human beings as merely things that can be guarded and used in this way." Indeed, the prisoner of war issue is not a technical issue. The U.S. "counter-proposal" regarding the treatment of prisoners of war fundamentally violates the Geneva Convention and international practice, and it is for this reason that the Korean-Chinese side absolutely cannot accept it. As for the so-called "philosophy of individual dignity and rights," then, as long as people remember the appalling atrocities of the U.S. side in the prisoner of war camps, they cannot help but feel disgusted by such hypocritical talk.

The U.S. State Department statement concludes by saying: "The United Nations Command will continue to seek every opportunity to achieve a glorious and reasonable solution to the Korean issue, but it will never give up the fundamental humanitarian principles that are extremely important to the entire free world." This shows that the U.S. ruling group has not gained any beneficial lessons from the universal condemnation and still insists on its claim to forcibly detain prisoners of war in violation of international conventions in order to achieve the purpose of obstructing the reaching of an agreement in the negotiations.

### 在世界舆论谴责下美国务院被迫发表声明  为美国政府阻挠朝鲜停战的政策进行辩解

    在世界舆论谴责下美国务院被迫发表声明  为美国政府阻挠朝鲜停战的政策进行辩解
    【新华社十七日讯】据美国新闻处消息，美国国务院在十五日发表声明，为美国政府阻挠朝鲜停战实现的政策进行辩解。
    美国国务院的声明是在全世界广大舆论谴责美国阻挠朝鲜停战谈判达成协议的情况下发表的。最近几天来，由于美方在板门店提出的“反建议”威胁着谈判的前途，这种谴责已发展到这样的程度，即：英国首相邱吉尔、印度总理尼赫鲁以及其他社会舆论明白地主张朝中谈判代表团提出的八点方案应该作为停战谈判协议的基础。
    鉴于这种形势，美国国务院在声明中不得不承认：朝中方面的使谈判得以恢复的新建议“提出了一些基础”，而五月七日的朝中方面提出的八点方案“可以作为光荣协议的基础”。但是，美国国务院的这些话只是为了替美方的“反建议”裹上一层糖衣。美国国务院的声明又把美方方案与我方方案的基本分歧轻描淡写地说成只是“一些修正”，它说：“五月十三日，联合国军司令部接受了共方这个最近的建议（按指朝中方面八点方案）中的许多意见作为谈判的基础，同时并对这个计划提出了一些修正，以便使计划得以实行。”
    美国国务院企图使人相信，美方“反建议”是以朝中方面八点方案为基础的。这完全是欺骗世界舆论的。朝中方面几天来就不断指出，美方“反建议”不但不是接受朝中八点方案作为谈判的基础，恰恰相反，它的基本方针是与朝中八点方案完全背道而驰。第一、朝中方案主张停战后所有不直接遣返的战俘移交给中立国遣返委员会，而美方“反建议”则主张停战后不直接遣返的朝鲜籍战俘不移交给中立国遣返委员会，而加以“就地释放”，就是说把他们交给李承晚；第二、朝中方案主张中立国遣返委员会应有充分的条件以执行其职务，美方“反建议”则对中立国遣返委员会的工作加以种种限制，使这个委员会无法行使其职权，而实际上处于美方的军事控制之下；第三、朝中方案主张有关方面对其所属的未被遣返的被俘人员有进行解释的充分自由与便利，美方“反建议”则对这种解释工作加以极其无理的限制以致这种解释徒具形式；第四、朝中方案主张在解释期满后仍未被遣返的战俘的处理，交由政治会议协商解决，美方“反建议”则反对交给政治会议处理，而予以“就地释放”，就是说交给李承晚或蒋介石匪帮。从这些分歧可以看到，美方“反建议”不但没有接受朝中八点方案的主要之点，而且推翻了恢复谈判的基础，即停战后所有不直接遣返的战俘移交给中立国看管的基础。这个基础是美方在恢复谈判以来一直表示同意的现在却自食其言了。
    美国国务院的声明把美方“反建议”的目的说成是“要使看管不遣返战俘的计划切合实际与公平，使这些战俘获得保障，同时使共方与世界各国人民认识到战俘是否回家完全由他们自己决定”。事实上，美方“反建议”的内容完全不符合这些目的。美方“反建议”中规定把朝鲜籍战俘“就地释放”是最不公平的、违反日内瓦公约的，它使这些战俘在得不到关于他们可以回家的解释之前就被交给李承晚了。美方“反建议”把停战后未直接遣返的战俘和看管这些战俘的中立国遣返委员会工作机构实际上置于美国军事控制之下，对他们的解释又受到种种限制，不足以消除他们两年来在美军恐怖统治下所积累的恐惧与疑虑，这怎能说是使这些战俘“获得保障”呢？这怎能说这些战俘可以自由决定他们是否回家呢？拆穿来说，美方反建议的目的绝不是国务院声明中所说的那些。贯串美方“反建议”中的基本方针是强迫扣留朝中被俘人员，其目的是破坏恢复谈判的基础，阻挠停战谈判迅速达成协议。
    美国国务院声明中企图把美方谈判代表在板门店会议帐篷中的一再拖延阻挠、出尔反尔的行为说成是“设法缩小问题的范围，以便给予所有战俘以最大的保障，并使看管委员会的工作顺利进行”。但是，事实是除了“设法缩小问题的范围”一点有半点真实外，其他都是十足的撒谎。美方的“设法缩小问题的范围”，就是“设法”将停战后应移交给中立国遣返委员会的未直接遣返的战俘的范围加以“缩小”，将三分之二以上的未被遣返的朝鲜人民军被俘人员加以强迫扣留；就是“设法”对中立国遣返委员会的职权与对战俘进行解释的自由和便利加以“缩小”；就是不把解释期满后尚未遣返的战俘处理问题交给政治会议解决，以强迫扣留他们，“缩小”遣返战俘的数目。但是，所有这些“缩小”的结果，就把恢复谈判的基础破坏了，就使谈判双方本来在遣返战俘的步骤、时间和方法上已趋缩小的分歧又重行加大了，就使停战谈判不能迅速达成协议了。
    美国国务院在声明中说美方反对“用武力强迫拒绝回家的战俘回家”、反对战俘“无限期地被拘留和看管”。但是事实上朝中方面从来就不主张“武力强迫遣返”，而美国方面却正要在其军事控制的南朝鲜地区对朝中被俘人员实行就地释放，这才是真正的“无限期拘留和看管”，也就是它历来所主张和实行的强迫扣留。
    美国国务院的声明说：“战俘问题并不是技术性问题，而是自由世界关于个人人格与权利的哲学中的基本问题。自由人不能够、也决不会同意把人类看作仅仅是可以这样看管与使用的东西。”的确，战俘问题不是技术性问题。美方“反建议”中关于战俘的处理，根本违反了日内瓦公约和国际惯例，正是因为这个缘故，朝中方面绝对不能接受。关于所谓“个人人格与权利的哲学”，那末，人们只要记起美方在战俘营中的惨不忍闻的暴行，就不禁要对这种伪君子的言谈感到恶心。
    美国国务院声明最后说：“联合国军司令部将继续寻求足以使朝鲜问题获得光荣合理的解决的每一机会，但是它决不放弃对于整个自由世界极为重要的基本人道原则。”这表明美国统治集团还没有从普及全世界的谴责中获得有益的教训，仍要坚持其违反国际公约的强迫扣留战俘的主张，以达到阻挠谈判达成协议的目的。
