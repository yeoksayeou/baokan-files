Xinhua News Agency report: American newspapers have recently expressed unease about the increasingly fierce competition in the Latin American market. Latin America occupies a crucial position in the trade of capitalist countries, especially the United States. As the "Latin American Business Highlights" pointed out, in 1952, Latin American countries absorbed 9 percent of the world's total exports. They purchased $3.3 billion worth of American goods, accounting for 22 percent of total U.S. exports, while U.S. imports from Latin America were valued at $3.45 billion.

During World War II and the first two or three years after the war, the United States greatly expanded in the Latin American market. By 1948, the United States had controlled two-thirds of the Latin American market, while the proportion held by European countries, which accounted for two-thirds of Latin American imports before World War II, had decreased to one-quarter.

However, starting in 1948, the United States' position began to decline as Western European countries and other capitalist countries reappeared in the Latin American market. Some Latin American countries, after quickly depleting their dollar reserves accumulated during the war, were forced to drastically reduce their purchases from the United States and import the goods they needed from Western Europe and Japan. The proportion of U.S. goods in Latin American imports decreased, intensifying competition. "Commercial News" said that European merchants, in their determined efforts to regain the positions they lost during the war, had taken back some of the American markets in Latin America. Competition from Europe has become more intense.

The imports of Western Europe and other countries into Latin America are growing rapidly. According to statistics from "Canadian Foreign Trade" magazine, West Germany's exports to Latin America increased from $3.2 million in 1948 to $369.3 million in 1951; Japan's exports increased from $6 million in 1949 to $8.1 million in 1951. Western European countries' exports to Mexico, Argentina, Colombia, and Uruguay are also increasing. Among these competitors, West Germany has become the United States' main opponent. In 1951, West Germany almost completely restored its pre-war position in twenty Latin American countries. American exporters are particularly shocked by West Germany's fierce competition. "Export Trade and Shipper" magazine pointed out that some of West Germany's exports to Latin America are funded by the United States itself through the "Economic Cooperation Administration."

After conducting a survey of the situation in Latin America and Western Europe, the American magazine "Export Trade and Shipper" wrote unhappily: American goods are facing increasingly fierce competition from Western European countries and Japan. Countries that were always willing to buy American goods are now ordering goods from Japan, West Germany, Britain, the Netherlands, France, Switzerland, Belgium, and Canada.

[Xinhua News Agency, dated 27th] TASS, Berlin, 21st: The West German industrial mouthpiece, "Handelsblatt" (Commercial News), recently published an article entitled: "Show Your Colors." The newspaper called on West German manufacturers to intensify their economic offensive against their competitors in the world market. It said: "Now is the best time to show our colors to our foreign competitors." Indeed, Western European countries competing with West Germany – primarily Britain – are increasingly feeling the "colors" of West German monopoly capitalists.

Not long ago, the British Electrical and Allied Manufacturers’ Association complained in its annual report about the increasingly intense competition from West German monopoly capitalists. The report said that the total value of goods exported by the West German electrical industry in 1951 was £56.3 million, but by 1952 it had increased to £89 million. West German electrical concerns have run to the traditional markets of the British Empire to seek development.

According to news from West German and British newspapers, West German industrialists are striving to establish their positions in India, Pakistan, Iran, Egypt, and other British "traditional" markets. The Hamburg newspaper "Die Welt" (The World) recently reported that in 1948, West Germany's exports to India totaled 26 million rupees, but in 1951-1952 it had increased to 282 million rupees.

In April of this year, Pakistan and West Germany held another round of trade negotiations. According to "Nation’s Forum", West Germany will export $64 million worth of metallurgical industry machinery and equipment to Pakistan before June 1953.

West German monopoly capitalists are also very active in the Iranian market. According to the British magazine "The Economist", the trade volume between West Germany and Iran now accounts for about 20 percent of Iran's total foreign trade.

Established and strengthened with dollar aid and American protection, West German trusts have launched a fierce offensive against their competitors, not only by increasing exports. They have become strong enough to export capital. Because of Britain's financial difficulties limiting its opportunities to export capital, West German monopoly capitalists are taking advantage of this opportunity to try to seize control of the industrial construction and irrigation projects of Eastern countries, especially those within the British sphere of influence. For example, it is well known that West German companies have already obtained a batch of construction contracts in Egypt, including the construction of a new bridge across the Nile, the reconstruction of the Zifta barrage, and the Cairo power station, worth approximately £7 million. West German entrepreneurs and bankers are also drafting a plan for the construction of Nile watergate projects costing £100 million.

West German construction companies have also signed a contract with Iran to build a new section of approximately 130 kilometers in the middle of a railway across Iran and have contracted for other projects.

West German companies have also signed a contract with Pakistan to build a tunnel, and Siemens & Halske, West Germany's largest monopoly capital enterprise, has won a contract to build a telephone equipment factory.

West German companies are also building hydroelectric power stations in India and repairing sluices on the Kabul River in Afghanistan.

Even in Iraq, West German enterprises have won contracts for the construction of a bridge and irrigation facilities on the Euphrates River.

### 美国、英国、西德、日本贸易竞争日益激烈

    美国、英国、西德、日本贸易竞争日益激烈
    据新华社讯：美国报纸最近对于拉丁美洲市场上越来越激烈的竞争表示不安。拉丁美洲在资本主义国家，尤其是美国的贸易中占着极重要的地位。正如“拉丁美洲商业要闻汇报”所指出：在一九五二年，拉丁美洲国家吸收了世界总输出的百分之九。它们购买了价值三十三亿美元的美国货，占美国总输出的百分之二十二，而美国自拉丁美洲的输入价值三十四亿五千万美元。
    在第二次世界大战期间以及战后的头二三年，美国在拉丁美洲市场上大为扩张。到一九四八年，美国已控制了三分之二的拉丁美洲市场，而在第二次世界大战以前占拉丁美洲输入三分之二的欧洲国家所占的比例，却减少到四分之一。
    不过从一九四八年开始，当西欧国家和其他资本主义国家重新在拉丁美洲市场上出现时，美国的地位便开始走下坡路了。一些拉丁美洲国家在快用完战争期间所积聚起来的美元储备之后，被迫大量减少它们向美国的购货，而自西欧和日本输入它们所需要的货物。在拉丁美洲的输入中，美国所占的比例越来越减少，这使得竞争尖锐起来。“商业新闻”说，欧洲商人们在恢复他们在战时失去的地位的坚决努力中，已经从拉丁美洲的许多美国市场中抢去了一部分。欧洲来的竞争已经更加激烈。
    西欧及其他国家在拉丁美洲的输入迅速增长。据“加拿大对外贸易”杂志的统计：西德向拉丁美洲的输出，已从一九四八年的三百二十万美元增加到一九五一年的三亿六千九百三十万美元；日本的输出从一九四九年的六百万美元增加到一九五一年的八百一十万美元。西欧国家对墨西哥、阿根廷、哥伦比亚与乌拉圭的输出也在增加。在这些竞争者中，西德已经成为美国的主要对手。西德在一九五一年就几乎完全恢复到战前在二十个拉丁美洲国家中所占的地位。美国的出口商对西德的激烈竞争特别感到震惊。“出口贸易与运输商”杂志指出，西德向拉丁美洲的一部分输出是由美国自己通过“经济合作总署”资助的。
    美国“出口贸易与运输商”杂志对拉丁美洲与西欧情况做了一番调查后，闷闷不乐地写道：美国的货物正遇到西欧国家与日本的日益激烈的竞争。一直愿意购买美国货物的国家，现在都向日本、西德、英国、荷兰、法国、瑞士、比利时与加拿大定购货物了。
    【新华社二十七日讯】据塔斯社柏林二十一日讯：西德工业界的喉舌“商业报”最近刊载了一篇文章，标题是：“显显你的威风”。这家报纸要求西德制造商对他们在世界市场中的竞争者加强经济攻势。它说：“现在是向我们的外国竞争者显露威风的最好时机了。”的确，与西德竞争的西欧各国——首先是英国——已日益感觉到西德垄断资本家的“威风”了。
    不久以前，英国电气工业协会在它的年度报告中抱怨西德垄断资本家越来越剧烈的竞争。这个报告说，西德电气工业在一九五一年出口的货物总值为五千六百三十万英镑，但到一九五二年即增加到八千九百万英镑。西德的电气康采恩已经跑到英帝国的传统市场上谋发展了。
    从西德和英国的报纸消息看来，西德工业家正竭力在印度、巴基斯坦、伊朗、埃及和其他英国的“传统”市场上建立他们的阵地。汉堡报纸“世界报”最近报道说，在一九四八年，西德向印度出口的货物总值为两千六百万卢比，到一九五一—一九五二年度已增至两亿八千二百万卢比。
    今年四月间，巴基斯坦和西德之间又进行了一次贸易谈判。据“民族论坛”说，在一九五三年六月以前，西德将向巴基斯坦输出价值六千四百万美元冶金工业用的机器和器材。
    西德垄断资本家在伊朗市场上也很活动。据英国“经济学家”杂志说，现在西德与伊朗的贸易额大约占伊朗全部对外贸易额的百分之二十。
    在美元的援助与美国的保护下建立和强大起来的西德托辣斯对它们的竞争者展开剧烈进攻，不仅限于增加出口货物。它们已经强大到有力量输出资本的程度。英国由于财政上的困难限制了它输出资本的机会，西德垄断资本家便趁此机会企图攫取东方各国、特别是在英国势力范围内的国家的工业建设和灌溉工程的控制权。例如，大家都知道，西德公司已经在埃及得到了一批建筑工程的合同，其中包括修筑一座横跨尼罗河的新桥梁、重修兹夫塔附近的水闸和开罗的发电站等约值七百万英镑的工程。西德企业家与银行家还正在草拟一项需费一亿英镑的建筑尼罗河水闸工程的计划。
    西德建筑公司也已与伊朗签订一项建筑横贯伊朗的铁路中间一段大约一百三十公里的新路线的合同，并承包了另外一些工程。
    西德公司又与巴基斯坦签订了一项建筑隧道的合同，西德最大的垄断资本企业西门子—哈尔塞克公司获得了建筑一座电话器材工厂的合同。
    西德公司并且在印度建筑水电站，在阿富汗修理喀布尔河上的水闸。
    甚至在伊拉克，西德企业也获得了建筑一座幼发拉底河上的桥梁与灌溉设施的合同。
