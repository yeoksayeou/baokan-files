Xinhua News Agency, May 27th: The German Democratic Republic Industrial Exhibition, which opened in Beijing on April 27th, closed on May 27th. During the month, a total of 1,729 factories, organizations, schools, and groups collectively visited the exhibition, with a total audience exceeding 703,000 people.

    The audience was extremely interested in the various industrial products exhibited, from large cranes to small precision instruments. Many enterprises requested machine samples from the exhibition to take back with them.

    To answer the wide range of questions raised by the audience about the exhibits, 194 seminars, 7 seminars between industrial experts and technical workers from Germany and China, and 4 report meetings were held.

    The Industrial Exhibition of the German Democratic Republic has left a deep impression on the minds of ordinary workers and technicians in China. Zhang Zhenying, a female bookbinder from the Beijing Printing Factory No. 1, wrote in the guestbook: "Today I saw the folding machine I had been dreaming of for a long time, which can fold 24,000 sheets of paper per hour. I never imagined such a high output." She expressed her determination to learn from the creative spirit of the German Democratic Republic workers and complete the 1953 production plan. A worker from a mechanical repair shop expressed the most interest in the twist drill grinder, the railway surface grinder, and the high-speed lathe, because these machine tools can increase work efficiency. Another audience member wrote in the guestbook: "I am deeply proud that our motherland has such an industrially developed friend who is good at manufacturing machines."

    A soldier of the Chinese People's Liberation Army wrote after visiting the exhibition: We have visited four times, but we still want to come again, because from here we not only saw the great achievements of the German Democratic Republic in industry, but also saw the future of the industrialization of New China.

    A soldier of the Chinese People's Volunteer Army said after visiting the exhibition that after returning to Korea, he would work harder to strive for an early victory in the War to Resist U.S. Aggression and Aid Korea.

    All exhibits will be transported to Shanghai for exhibition.

    民主德国工业展览会在京闭幕
    一个月期间观众超过七十万三千人
    【新华社二十七日讯】四月二十七日在北京开幕的德意志民主共和国工业展览会于五月二十七日闭幕。一个月中，共有一千七百二十九个工厂、机关、学校与团体集体参观了这个展览会，观众总人数超过七十万三千人。
    观众对于这次展览会上所展出的各种工业产品，大至起重机，小至精密仪器，都极感兴趣。各企业单位纷纷向展览会索取机器样本带回去。
    为回答观众就展出的展品提出的内容广泛的问题，曾举行了一百九十四次座谈会，七次德中两国工业专家与技术工人的座谈会及四次报告会。
    德意志民主共和国的工业展览会已经在中国的普通工人和技术人员心目中留下了深刻的印象。北京印刷一厂的一个装订女工张振英在留言册上写道：“今天我看到了我幻想了很久的摺页机，每小时能摺纸二万四千张，这样高的产量真是我所想不到的。”她表示一定要很好地学习民主德国工人的创造精神，完成一九五三年的生产计划。一位机械修配厂的工人对于麻花钻磨床和铁道平面磨床及快速车床表示最感兴趣，因为这种工作母机能增加工作效率。另一个观众在留言册上写道：“我深为我们祖国有这样一个工业发达而善于制造机器的朋友感到骄傲。”
    中国人民解放军的一位战士在看过展览会后写道：我们来看过四次了，但是还想再来，因为从这里我们不但看到了民主德国在工业上的伟大成就，而且还看到了新中国工业化的未来。
    中国人民志愿军的一个战士在看过展览会之后表示，他在回到朝鲜后，一定要更加努力地为争取抗美援朝的早日胜利而斗争。
    展览会全部展品将运往上海展出。
