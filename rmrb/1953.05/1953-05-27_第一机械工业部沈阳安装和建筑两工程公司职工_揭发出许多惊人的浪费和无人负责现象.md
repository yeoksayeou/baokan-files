    Workers of the Shenyang Installation and Construction Companies of the First Ministry of Machine Building
    Expose Many Shocking Waste and Lack of Accountability Phenomena

    [By Our Own Correspondent] The Shenyang Installation Engineering Company and the Construction Engineering Company of the Basic Construction Engineering Bureau of the First Ministry of Machine Building, with the help of the work team of the Basic Construction Engineering Bureau of the First Ministry of Machine Building, have respectively launched a mass movement against waste, against irresponsibility, and to establish a responsibility system since the beginning of May, in conjunction with the struggle against bureaucracy, in order to establish various important responsibility systems in a step-by-step manner.

    These two companies, with the help of the work team of the Basic Construction Engineering Bureau of the First Ministry of Machine Building, actively carried out various preparatory work in late April, such as establishing a Responsibility System Promotion Committee, studying and discussing the purpose, requirements, steps, and methods of the movement, and formulating a planned schedule. , collected and distributed relevant study documents and reference materials. Currently, the movement has entered the inspection phase.

    Judging from the materials initially exposed, the phenomena of waste and lack of accountability in these two companies in the past were very serious. In the project of installing 108 Soviet-style machine tools for the Northeast Machinery Factory No. 7 from mid-March to late April this year, the Shenyang Installation Engineering Company did not sign a contract, nor did it inspect the machines to be installed in advance. The installation plan was not well prepared, and the materials and tools were not fully equipped. The project was started rashly; moreover, during the construction process, no one was responsible for checking the quality. As a result, although all 108 machine tools were installed, the quality was poor and they could not be put into production, which affected the production tasks of the Machinery Factory No. 7 this year. Now, Machinery Factory No. 7 refuses to accept these machine tools; the installation company does not dare to install the second batch of machine tools, the workers have no work to do, and the installation tasks this year have also been greatly affected. The Shenyang Construction Engineering Company has repeatedly reworked the foundation project and bricklaying project of the sawmill factory building three times, and the waste and lack of accountability in material supply work are shocking. For example, of the levels and theodolites purchased by the company, 14 out of 20 levels were unusable due to non-compliance with specifications; and 4 out of 9 theodolites had to be repaired before they could be used. In addition, the losses due to fines and storage fees due to untimely material transportation alone amounted to more than 220 million yuan. The situation of planning lagging behind construction and being unrealistic also affected the progress of the project. In the first quarter of this year, when the installation company installed machines for the Northeast Machinery Factory No. 14 and Machinery Factory No. 7, the plans were behind the construction. The plan for the project of Machinery Factory No. 14 was made after the project was completed; the plan for Machinery Factory No. 7 was made three days after the construction started. What is even more serious is that the contract and plan are not based on reality, which causes serious waste of manpower. For example, the installation company accepted the installation task of 86 machines for the Northeast Machinery Factory No. 25. The Engineering Planning Section signed contracts with Factory No. 25 in batches, but among the 36 machines that were contracted to be installed, 25 had not been ordered; on the contrary, 37 machines that had arrived had not been contracted for installation. Therefore, on the one hand, the workers have no work to do, and on the other hand, the 37 machines that are placed there are not installed by anyone. Irresponsibility is also manifested in the lack of close contact between departments and between cadres, and in shirking responsibility to each other. For example, when the Second Engineering Team of the Installation Company was installing machines for the Machinery Factory No. 7, a milling machine was damaged due to careless handling. The company manager wanted to find out the reason, and asked the technical security officer. The technical security officer said: "I am in charge of personal injury accidents. I am not in charge of machine damage"; when he asked the technical inspection personnel, the technical inspection personnel said: "I am in charge of the quality of the project, but I am not in charge of this"; when he asked the engineering planning personnel, the planning personnel said: "We are even more not in charge of this." Also, during the construction of the same project, the workers who draw lines for the foundation needed chalk. The on-site material requisition personnel went to the company's material section to collect it. The people in the material section said: "We have not prepared this, you can go to the administrative section to collect it!" When they arrived at the administrative section, the people in the administrative section said: "This is something used in production, you should still go to the material section!" Pushing back and forth, as a result, the work of drawing lines for the foundation was delayed for three days because of the small problem of chalk.

    After the initial exposure, the leading cadres and workers of these two companies were shocked and realized the importance of launching a movement against waste, against irresponsibility, and to establish a responsibility system at this time, and realized that this is a matter of urgency. Those leading cadres who were originally worried that launching this movement would affect the construction have also realized that the task cannot be completed precisely because of the serious irresponsibility and chaotic work, and have corrected their understanding. After the inspection work is over, the movement will turn to the stage of drafting system drafts, submitting them to the masses for repeated discussion, revision, and approval, and finally announcing and implementing the finalized responsibility system, and assigning the method of regularly checking the implementation of the responsibility system to certain departments for implementation.

    第一机械工业部沈阳安装和建筑两工程公司职工
    揭发出许多惊人的浪费和无人负责现象
    【本报讯】中央第一机械工业部基本建设工程局沈阳安装工程公司和建筑工程公司，已分别从五月初起，结合反官僚主义斗争，展开了群众性的反对浪费、反对无人负责和建立责任制运动，以便有步骤地建立各项重要的责任制度。
    这两个公司在第一机械工业部基本建设工程局工作组的帮助下，在四月下旬就积极进行了各项准备工作，如成立了责任制推行委员会，研究和讨论了运动的目的、要求、步骤与方法，拟订了计划进度，搜集和印发了有关的学习文件及参考材料。目前，运动已进入检查工作的阶段。
    从初步揭发出来的材料来看，这两个公司过去的浪费和无人负责现象是很严重的。沈阳安装工程公司在今年三月中旬到四月下旬在为东北机械七厂安装一百零八台苏联式机床的工程中，不订合同，也不预先检查将要安装的机器，安装计划没有做好，材料和工具没有备齐，就冒然施工；而且，在施工过程中，没有专人负责检查质量。结果，虽然把一百零八台机床全部安装好了，但质量低劣，不能投入生产，影响了机械七厂今年的生产任务。现在，机械七厂拒绝验收这批机床；安装工程公司不敢安装第二批机床，工人没活干，今年的安装任务也受到很大影响。沈阳建筑工程公司在建造制材厂厂房的基础工程及砌砖工程中，连续返工三次，材料供应工作方面的浪费和无人负责现象很惊人。例如该公司购买的水平仪和经纬仪，在二十台水平仪中，有十四台因不合规格而不能使用；在九台经纬仪中，有四台要经过修理才能使用。又如仅仅因为材料运输不及时所遭受的罚款及保管费的损失就达两亿二千余万元。计划落后于施工和不切合实际的情况也影响了工程的进度。在今年第一季度里，安装工程公司为东北机械十四厂和机械七厂安装机器时，计划都落在施工后面。机械十四厂的工程完了计划才作出来；机械七厂在施工三天以后计划才作出来。更严重的是订合同、作计划都不从实际出发，造成严重的窝工现象。如安装工程公司接受了东北机械二十五厂八十六台机械的安装任务，工程计划科分批与二十五厂订合同，但在订了合同要安装的三十六台机器中，有二十五台的订货没有到；相反，已经到了的三十七台机器却没有订安装合同。因此，一方面工人没活干，另一方面摆着的三十七台机器却没有人去安装。无人负责现象，还表现在部门之间、干部之间联系不紧，互相推诿责任等方面。如安装工程公司第二工程队在为机械七厂安装机器时，由于搬运不谨慎，摔坏一台铣床。公司经理要追查原因，找技术保安员，技术保安员说：“我是管人身事故的，机器摔坏了我管不着”；找技术检查人员，技术检查人员说：“我是管工程质量的，管不着这个”；问工程计划人员，计划人员说：“我们更管不着这个了”。也是在同一个工程的施工过程中，基础画线工人需要粉笔，现场领料人员到公司材料科领，材料科的人说：“我们没准备这个，你们到行政科领吧！”到了行政科，行政科的人又说：“这是生产上用的东西，你们还是找材料科吧！”推来推去，结果为了小小的粉笔问题，竟使基础画线工作推延了三天。
    经过初步的揭发，使得这两个公司的领导干部和职工大吃一惊，认识到在目前开展一个反对浪费、反对无人负责和建立责任制运动的重要意义，认识到这是一个迫不及待的大事。那些原来顾虑开展这一运动会影响施工的领导干部，也认识了任务的不能完成，正是由于严重的无人负责、工作混乱所造成的，而端正了自己的认识。在检查工作结束后，运动即转入拟订制度草案，交群众反复讨论、修正和通过的阶段，最后还要把定案的责任制公布施行，并将拟定经常检查责任制执行情况的办法，交给一定的部门掌握执行。
