Xinhua News Agency report: The entire delegation of representatives from the Chinese People's Volunteer Army who returned to the country for the "May Day" celebrations concluded their reports to people from all walks of life in Beijing on May 19th, starting from the 12th. Over the past few days, they gave a total of 66 reports to people from all walks of life, with approximately 170,000 listeners.

The return of the most beloved people from the Korean front received an incomparably warm welcome from the people of Beijing, and their heroic deeds became a force inspiring the vast number of listeners to move forward. When Special Class Merit Citation recipient Li Man and First Class Merit Citation recipient Li Wensheng gave a report at the Chengzi Coal Mine of the Beijing West Mining Bureau, many workers had just come up from the mine and hadn't even taken off their work clothes before rushing to listen. When the workers heard about Li Man's heroic deeds on the front lines near Panmunjom, where he repelled ten enemy attacks with a single squad and killed or wounded 250 enemies, they immediately proposed using practical actions to increase production to respond to the Volunteer Army. Tunneling workers guaranteed to improve tunneling efficiency, and transportation workers put forward the slogan "Absolutely no coal will be stockpiled in the mine." Second Class Combat Hero and Special Class Merit Citation recipient Li Degui, in his report at the Chongwen District Workers' Congress, said that in one battle, just as the enemy was launching an attack on them, they received letters of sympathy from workers in the motherland. To repay the care of the people of the motherland, the soldiers fought bravely and defeated the enemy's attack. This part of his report aroused thunderous applause from the audience. Beijing model worker Guan Zhongyue solemnly stated: We guarantee to work harder and support you with practical actions. The heroes' reports in the suburbs of Beijing greatly encouraged the farmers. When they reported in the eastern suburbs of Beijing, farmers from more than twenty li away came to listen; during the report meeting, many letters of sympathy were sent to the rostrum. Farmer Wang Deshan wrote: We guarantee to grow more grain to repay you. Young students and Young Pioneers showed even more enthusiastic welcomes to the heroes' reports. Combat Hero, Pioneer Battalion Commander, and First Class Merit Citation recipient Hao Zhongyun, in his report at Tsinghua University, said: "In order to defend world peace and the security of the motherland, and to enable you to study with peace of mind, we are determined to fight until the Korean War is truly peacefully resolved." Immediately, many notes were passed up from all around the venue. Some said: "We express our determination to you: we must complete our studies!" Others said: "With your brilliant example, we will never be disgraced!" People from all walks of life, including the literary and art circles and the industrial and commercial circles, also expressed after listening to the heroes' reports that they would do their jobs well and better support the most beloved people.

The heroic and skillful fighting and firm will of the Chinese People's Volunteer Army heroes in defending the motherland, and their noble spirit of patriotism and internationalism, moved the vast number of listeners. At the report meetings, many people asked to establish communication relationships with the heroes and become close friends. They believed that being able to establish communication relationships with the heroes on the front lines of resisting America and aiding Korea was their greatest honor.

    志愿军代表在北京市作报告受到热烈欢迎
    据新华社讯：中国人民志愿军“五一”节归国观礼代表团全体代表，自十二日开始向北京各界人民作报告，至十九日结束。几天来共向各界人民分别作了六十六场报告，听众约达十七万人。
    朝鲜前线的最可爱的人的归来，受到北京人民热情无比的欢迎，他们英雄事迹的报告，成为鼓舞广大听众前进的力量。当特等功臣李满、一等功臣李文生到京西矿务局城子煤矿作报告时，许多工人刚从井下上来，工作服还没脱，就赶来听讲。工人们听到李满在板门店附近战线上，以一个班的兵力打退敌人十次进攻，杀伤敌人二百五十名的英勇事迹时，立即提出了要用提高生产的实际行动来回答志愿军。掘进工人保证提高掘进效率，运输工人提出了“绝不将煤积压在井下”的口号。二级战斗英雄、特等功臣李德贵在崇文区工人大会上报告时，他说到在一次战斗中敌人正向他们发起进攻，他们刚好收到了祖国工人的慰问信。为了报答祖国人民的关怀，战士们奋勇作战，打垮了敌人的进攻。他这段报告激起了全场雷鸣般的掌声。北京市劳动模范关忠岳郑重地表示：我们保证更加努力生产，用实际行动来支援你们。英雄们在京郊的报告，给农民们以极大鼓舞。他们在北京东郊区报告时，二十几里路以外的农民都赶来听；在报告会进行当中，就有很多慰问信送到了主席台上。农民王德山写着：我们保证要多打粮食来报答你们。青年学生、少年儿童队员们，对英雄的报告更表现了狂热的欢迎。战斗英雄、先锋营长、一等功臣郝忠云在清华大学作报告时，当他说到：“为了保卫世界和平和祖国安全，为了使你们能安心学习，我们决心战斗到朝鲜战争真正和平解决时为止”，全场四周立刻传来了许多条子。有的说：“我们向你们表示决心：一定完成学习任务！”有的说：“有你们光辉的榜样，我们决不会丢脸！”文艺界、工商界等各界人民，在听了英雄们的报告后，也都纷纷表示要做好工作，更好地支援最可爱的人。
    中国人民志愿军英雄们英勇善战、保卫祖国的坚强意志，和他们爱国主义与国际主义的崇高精神，感动了广大的听众。在报告会上，不少人要求和英雄们建立通讯关系，作个亲密的朋友。他们认为能够和在抗美援朝前线上的英雄们建立通讯关系，是他们最大的光荣。
