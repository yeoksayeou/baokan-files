    Conscientiously Study the Advanced Experience of the Soviet Union
    --Special Interview on the Seventh National Congress of Chinese Trade Unions
    By Our Reporter Chang Gong

    To study the advanced experience of the Soviet Union and build our country – this is Chairman Mao’s great call and also one of the tasks put forward by the Seventh National Congress of Chinese Trade Unions. In recent years, many factories and mines have achieved great successes in studying the advanced experience of the Soviet Union. For example, the implementation of "rapid steelmaking" in the iron and steel industry increased production in 1952 by 40 percent compared to 1951; the implementation of the "high-speed cutting method" in the machinery industry improved efficiency several times or even dozens of times; 80 percent of coal mines have implemented the "new coal mining method," with the Huainan Coal Mine increasing coal production from one ton to seven tons per person per day, greatly improving recovery rates and ensuring safety; in the power industry, the "method of burning low-quality coal" has been adopted, greatly reducing costs, with the Beijing Shijingshan Power Plant reducing costs by 43 percent. At the Seventh National Congress of Chinese Trade Unions, representatives from all over the country, especially those from the Northeast region where the advanced experience of the Soviet Union was studied earlier, brought rich experiences, insights, and opinions on studying the advanced experience of the Soviet Union.

    The study of the advanced experience of the Soviet Union is primarily determined by the correct understanding of the advanced experience of the Soviet Union by all employees, especially the main leaders of factories and mines. The advanced experience of the Soviet Union is the experience created and accumulated by the Soviet people through labor and wisdom in the socialist construction cause over the past 30 years, and it is extremely important for our country, which has just started its first Five-Year Plan. Failure to recognize this, or insufficient recognition, will hinder our study. Comrade Lin Xiaoxia, Secretary of the Fuxin Municipal Committee of the Communist Party of China and a representative to the Seventh National Congress of Chinese Trade Unions, believes that this is the key to studying the advanced experience of the Soviet Union and also a sign of examining the study of the advanced experience of the Soviet Union. He said that the study of the advanced experience of the Soviet Union in Fuxin factories and mines proves this point. For example, in terms of vertical shafts, because the main leaders realized that studying the advanced experience of the Soviet Union is the main means and method to improve and enhance production, they placed the study of the advanced experience of the Soviet Union in the primary position, and educated workers to strictly abide by and implement the suggestions of Soviet experts. Therefore, in October last year, they created a national record of advancing 72 meters per day in vertical shafts. However, in terms of inclined shafts, because the main leaders did not have a sufficient understanding of this issue and were satisfied with their own achievements, when the higher authorities called for studying the advanced experience of the Soviet Union, they felt that there was nothing remarkable about it, and did not actively organize workers to study, resulting in slow production progress and frequent accidents, lagging far behind the requirements of production.

    Everyone knows that the former China Changchun Railway had achievements in studying the advanced experience of the Soviet Union. How did they study it? What are the main experiences? Comrade Wang Longjiang, Chief Engineer of the Dalian Branch of the Harbin Railway Administration and a representative to the Seventh National Congress of Chinese Trade Unions, believes that not all units of the former China Changchun Railway studied well. The units that did better were those where the Party committee, administration, trade union, and Communist Youth League and other organizations were able to regard the study of the advanced experience of the Soviet Union as a common political task. Every advanced experience of the Soviet Union includes not only ideological issues and technical issues, but also changes in labor organization and the allocation of forces. None of these aspects can be lacking. He used the implementation of financial planning in the former China Changchun Railway as an example. He said that when he was the director of the locomotive section of the Changchun Branch, they would not have been able to implement the financial plan without the Party branch, administration, trade union, and Communist Youth League all regarding the study of the advanced experience of the Soviet Union as a common task. Because this advanced experience of the Soviet Union requires a small number of people to undertake very heavy work. According to the financial plan, 600 people in their entire section had to be transferred to other jobs, all the past organizational structures had to be changed, and many problems that came with this had to be solved. Under these circumstances, the various organizations in their section, under the unified leadership of the Party branch, divided the work and cooperated. For example, the Party branch focused on resolving the thinking of the transferred personnel, the trade union and the Communist Youth League actively looked for suitable jobs for the transferred personnel, and the administration focused on changing the organizational structure. Therefore, they did not encounter any difficulties in implementing this advanced experience, and it laid the foundation for the implementation of many advanced experiences in the future.

    Comrade Zhou Chuandian, Deputy Director of the Ironmaking Plant of Anshan Iron and Steel Company and a representative to the Seventh National Congress of Chinese Trade Unions, believes that the process of studying the advanced experience of the Soviet Union is a process of struggle between the new and the old, and between advanced and backward thinking. Therefore, the leadership of industrial and mining enterprises must vigorously rely on advanced technical personnel and workers. He said that as early as the spring of 1950, when Soviet experts were designing the large-scale construction that is beginning at Anshan Iron and Steel Company today, they proposed suggestions such as using sintered ore to smelt low-silicon iron, implementing rapid ironmaking, and reducing the effective utilization coefficient. The purpose was to fundamentally change the colonial industrial situation left over from the past enemy and puppet regime, and make Anshan Iron and Steel Company an industrial base with low costs, large output, and good quality. However, these suggestions were opposed by many engineers at the time. For example, in the puppet Manchukuo period, the Japanese had experimented with using sintered ore to smelt low-silicon iron many times without success. Later, they took the ore from Anshan to Europe and the United States for testing, but it still failed. Many engineers also believed that it was impossible, and also translated an article written by an American engineer entitled "On the Future of Anshan" to confirm their views. Under these circumstances, the leadership of the ironmaking plant criticized the views of the engineers who opposed the experiment, relied on and organized advanced technical personnel and workers, concentrated forces, and conducted experiments, and vigorously solved difficulties for the experimental personnel during the experiment process (for example, after the first experiment failed, the leadership organized the experimental personnel to summarize, draw lessons from the experience, and then organized the experimental personnel for the second experiment). In this way, after more than a year, the experiment was finally successful.

    Comrade Wang Wenshan, Director of the Machining Workshop of the No. 1 Machine Tool Plant in Shenyang and a representative to the Seventh National Congress of Chinese Trade Unions, said that in studying the advanced experience of the Soviet Union, it is necessary to combine it with specific circumstances, start from reality, and absolutely avoid formalism and mechanically copying. He said that last year, when they studied the advanced Soviet experience of organizing rhythmic and balanced production according to instruction charts, they did not consider their own actual situation, but instead copied a set from the No. 3 Machine Tool Plant. As a result, not only could it not be implemented, but it also disrupted the original production. Some workers said: "What advanced experience, I think it is not as good as our original set." After discovering this situation, they held various meetings to study and found that the reason for this situation was not that the advanced experience of the Soviet Union was not good, but that they did not start from their own specific situation. Therefore, they re-studied according to their own situation. For example, their workshop processes nearly seven or eight hundred kinds of parts. If each part is calculated with four processes, there are more than 3,000 processes, which is very complicated. To organize rhythmic and balanced production according to instruction charts, it is necessary to know how many parts can be produced every day. Therefore, they first established a "daily finished product instruction chart" according to this situation. Later, they found that to organize rhythmic and balanced production according to instruction charts, it is necessary to prepare materials and tools in advance. Therefore, they established a "preparation work instruction chart." With this chart, it is possible to know at any time what is missing or lacking in the entire workshop, and the supply is guaranteed. Because they established various necessary systems and charts according to the situation in their workshop and strengthened management, they reversed the chaotic production situation and made the production of the entire workshop embark on a new road of production that had never been seen before.

    The study of the advanced experience of the Soviet Union should also be carried out in an organized and planned manner, grasping the main links, from beginning to end, and opposing hot-and-cold disease. Comrade Hu Naicong, Chairman of the Trade Union of the No. 15 Machine Tool Plant in Qiqihar and a representative to the Seventh National Congress of Chinese Trade Unions, said that they neglected this point when studying the high-speed cutting method in their factory. At that time, they only knew that the high-speed cutting method was a good way to exert the efficiency of machines and increase production. They called on workers to learn this method, but they did not think about the relationship between this method and all aspects of the entire factory, and therefore did not carry it out in an organized and planned manner. As a result, many deviations occurred. For example, some workers ignored product quality for the sake of "high speed," and some workers ignored machine maintenance for the sake of "high speed," and so on. On the surface, the output seemed to have increased many times, but after arriving at the assembly workshop, it was found that the output of various parts was very unbalanced, which seriously affected the progress of the assembly work and still could not complete the task. After drawing this lesson, they first paid attention to this issue when studying the rhythmic and balanced production organized according to instruction charts last year. They not only organized technical personnel, workshop cadres, and workers to visit factories and mines that had studied better, but also worked with Soviet experts to formulate a plan for learning and promotion. Especially in the process of promotion, they also grasped the main links, such as focusing on the machining workshop and setting up examples. As a result, this advanced experience was quickly promoted throughout the factory, making the production of the entire factory take on a new look. The output in the second half of last year increased by one time compared with the first half of the year, and it also met the quality standards.

    From the above situation, studying the advanced experience of the Soviet Union not only has extremely important significance for improving and enhancing the production of our factories and mines, but also has decisive significance for our planned construction that has just begun. Because all our new constructions in the future are the newest and most modern constructions, and their scale and technical complexity are unprecedented. Therefore, conscientiously studying the advanced experience of the Soviet Union is even more urgent and important. Chairman Mao issued a call at the Fourth Session of the First National Committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference: "We must learn from the Soviet Union. We are going to carry out great national construction. The work before us is very arduous, and our experience is insufficient. Therefore, we must conscientiously learn from the advanced experience of the Soviet Union. Whether inside or outside the Party, old cadres or new cadres, technical personnel, intellectuals, workers, or peasants, all must sincerely and sincerely learn from the Soviet Union. We must not only study the theories of Marx, Engels, Lenin, and Stalin, but also study the advanced science and technology of the Soviet Union. We must launch a high tide of learning from the Soviet Union throughout the country to build our country." Let us, under this great call of Chairman Mao, conscientiously study the advanced experience of the Soviet Union and bravely advance to complete the country's first Five-Year Plan!

    认真学习苏联的先进经验
    ——中国工会第七次全国代表大会专题访问
    本报记者　常工
    学习苏联先进经验，来建设我们的国家。这是毛主席的伟大号召，也是中国工会第七次全国代表大会提出的任务之一。几年来，许多厂矿企业在学习苏联先进经验上，都获得了很大的成就。譬如钢铁工业实行了“快速炼钢”，就使得一九五二年的产量比一九五一年提高百分之四十；机械工业实行了
    “高速切削法”，有的效率提高好几倍，有的提高几十倍；煤矿工业百分之八十都实行了“新式采煤法”，淮南煤矿由每人每天采煤一吨提高到七吨，回收率大大提高，安全也有了保障；电业方面，采用了“烧劣质煤的办法”，成本大为降低，北京石景山发电厂就降低成本达百分之四十三。中国工会第七次全国代表大会上，来自全国各地的代表，特别是在学习苏联先进经验较早的东北地区的代表，带来了关于学习苏联先进经验的丰富经验、心得和意见。
    学习苏联先进经验，首先就决定于全体职工，特别是厂矿企业的主要干部，对于苏联先进经验的正确的认识。苏联先进经验，是苏联人民在三十多年来的社会主义建设事业中，用劳动和智慧创造和积累起来的经验，对于我们刚刚开始第一个五年建设计划的国家是极其重要的。如果不认识到这点，或者认识得不够深刻，都是会妨碍我们学习的。中国工会第七次全国代表大会的代表、中共阜新市委书记林肖侠同志，认为这点是学习苏联先进经验的关键，也是检查学习苏联先进经验的标志。他说阜新市厂矿学习苏联先进经验中，就证明了这点。如在竖井方面，由于主要领导干部，认识到学习苏联先进经验就是改进与提高生产的主要手段和主要方法，他们便把学习苏联先进经验放在首要的地位，对于苏联专家的建议，就教育工人确实遵守和执行。因此在去年十月间，他们便创造了竖井日进七十二公尺的全国最高纪录。但在斜井方面，因为主要干部对于这一问题认识不够，并满足于自己已经获得的成绩，在上级号召学习苏联先进经验时，他们便认为没有什么了不起的地方，就不积极地去组织工人学习，结果生产进展迟缓，而事故则经常发生，远远地落后于生产的要求。
    谁都知道原中国长春铁路，在学习苏联先进经验上是有成绩的。他们是怎样学习的呢？有那些主要的经验呢？中国工会第七次全国代表大会的代表、哈尔滨铁路管理局大连分局总工程师王龙江同志，他认为原中国长春铁路在学习苏联先进经验上，并不是所有的单位都学得很好，其中做得比较好的单位，就是由于那些单位的党委、行政、工会和青年团等组织，能够把学习苏联先进经验，当作是共同的政治任务。苏联的每种先进经验，不仅包括思想问题，技术问题，而且还包括劳动组织的改变、力量的配备等问题，缺少了那一方面都是不行的。他以原中国长春铁路实行财务计划为例来说明那时他在长春分局机务段当段长，他说要不是段上的党支部、行政、工会和青年团都把学习苏联先进经验当作共同的任务，他们就根本不可能实行财务计划。因为苏联的这一先进经验，就是要用少数的人员，来担负起很繁重的工作。按照财务计划的规定，当时他们全段就有六百个人要转业，过去的一切组织机构都要改变，随此而来的许多问题都要解决。在这种情况下，他们段的各种组织，便在党支部的统一领导下，分工合作。如党支部着重打通转业人员的思想，工会和青年团积极为转业的人员找适当的工作岗位，而行政上专心改变组织机构。因此在实行这一先进经验中，他们没有遇到什么困难，并且还为以后实行许多先进经验打下了基础。
    中国工会第七次全国代表大会的代表、鞍山钢铁公司炼铁厂的副厂长周传典同志，根据他们学习苏联先进经验的体会，他认为学习苏联先进经验的过程，就是新与旧、先进与落后思想斗争的过程，因此，工矿企业的领导上，就要大力地依靠先进的技术人员与工人。他说远在一九五○年的春天，苏联专家为鞍山钢铁公司今天开始的大规模建设进行设计时，曾给他们提出用烧结矿炼低矽铁，实行快速炼铁与降低有效利用系数等建议，其目的在于从根本上改变过去敌伪遗留下来的殖民地工业状况，使鞍山钢铁公司成为成本低、产量大、质量好的一个工业基地。但是这些建议，在当时便遭到许多工程师的反对。譬如用烧结矿炼低矽铁，在伪满时期，日本人曾多次试验都没有成功，以后还把鞍山的矿石拿到欧、美各国去化验，结果还是失败了。许多工程师也就认为不可能，并且还把一个美国工程师写的“论鞍山的前途”的文章翻译出来，证实他们的观点。在这种情况下，炼铁厂的领导上，就批判了反对试验的工程师的观点，依靠和组织先进的技术人员和工人，集中力量，进行试验，并且在试验过程中，大力地为试验人员解决困难（如第一次试验失败后，领导上就组织试验人员进行总结，得出经验教训以后，又组织试验人员第二次试验）。就这样经过了一年多的时间，终于试验成功。
    中国工会第七次全国代表大会的代表、沈阳市第一机器制造厂加工车间主任王文山同志说在学习苏联先进经验中，必须结合具体情况，从实际出发，绝对不能形式主义，硬搬硬套。他说去年他们学习苏联按指示图表组织有节奏的均衡的先进经验生产时，就没有考虑到自己的实际情况，而是把第三机器制造厂的一套搬过来，结果不但实行不通，并且把原来的生产也弄得混乱不堪。有些工人就说：“什么先进经验，我看还不如咱们原来的一套。”他们发现这个情况后，就召开各种会议研究，发现所以发生这样的情况，并不是苏联先进经验不好，而是他们没有从自己的具体情况出发。于是，他们就根据自己的情况，重新进行研究。如他们车间加工的部件将近七八百种，每种部件以四道工序计算，就有三千多道工序，非常复杂。要按指示图表组织有节奏的均衡的生产，就必须知道每天能够生产多少部件，于是他们就根据这种情况，首先建立了“逐日成品指示图”。以后又发现要按指示图表组织有节奏的均衡的生产，必须事先作好材料和工具的准备工作，于是他们又建立了“准备工作指示图”。有了这个图表，全车间那里缺什么，少什么，随时都可以知道，供应也就有了保证。由于他们根据他们车间的情况，建立了各种必要的制度和图表，加强了管理，就扭转了混乱的生产局面，使得全车间的生产开始走上了从来没有过的生产的新道路。
    学习苏联先进经验，还要有组织、有计划地进行，抓住主要的环节，有始有终，反对冷热病。中国工会第七次全国代表大会的代表、齐齐哈尔第十五机器制造厂的工会主席胡乃琮同志说，他们工厂在学习高速切削法时，就疏忽了这一点。当时只知道高速切削法，是发挥机器效能、提高生产的一个好办法，便号召工人学习这一方法，却没有想到学习这一方法后，对于整个工厂各方面的关系，因而也就没有有组织、有计划地进行。结果便发生了许多偏向，如有的工人为了“高速”，就不管产品质量，有的工人为了“高速”，更不管机器的保养等等。从表面上看来，产量好像提高了好多倍，但到装配车间以后，却发现各种部件的产量很不平衡，反而严重地影响了装配工作的进行，仍不能完成任务。他们得出这一经验教训后，在去年学习按指示图表组织有节奏的均衡的生产时，就首先注意到这个问题。不仅组织了技术人员、车间干部和工人，到学习得比较好的厂矿去参观，并且还会同苏联专家一起，制定了学习和推广的计划。特别是在推广过程中，还抓住了主要的环节，如以加工车间为主，树立榜样等等。结果这一先进经验很快地就在全厂推广，使得全厂生产面貌为之一新。去年下半年的产量，就比上半年提高了一倍，并且还合乎质量标准。
    从以上的情况来看，学习苏联先进经验，不但对于改进和提高我们的厂矿生产有着极其重大的意义，而且对于我们刚刚开始的有计划的建设，更有着决定性的意义。因为我们今后所有的新的建设，都是最新式的、现代化的建设，其规模之巨大，技术之复杂，是从来没有过的，因此，认真地学习苏联先进经验，就更为迫切和重要了。毛主席在中国人民政治协商会议第一届全国委员会第四次会议上发出号召：“要学习苏联。我们要进行伟大的国家建设，我们面前的工作是很艰苦的，我们的经验是不够的，因此，要认真学习苏联的先进经验。无论共产党内、共产党外、老干部、新干部、技术人员、知识分子以及工人群众和农民群众，都必须诚心诚意地向苏联学习。我们不仅要学习马克思、恩格斯、列宁、斯大林的理论，而且要学习苏联先进的科学技术。我们要在全国范围内掀起学习苏联的高潮，来建设我们的国家。”让我们在毛主席这个伟大的号召下，认真学习苏联的先进经验，为完成国家的第一个五年建设计划奋勇前进吧！
