Xinhua News Agency, Budapest, May 7th: The Hungarian News Agency reported: Hungarian Minister of Foreign Affairs Molnár wrote back on the 6th to Dr. Wirth, Nenni, and Joliot-Curie, stating that the Hungarian government agreed with their letter requesting the Hungarian government to support the proposal to conclude a five-power peace pact. Molnár's letter said: The Hungarian government sincerely welcomes your letter, written on behalf of the people of the world’s peace congress, to the five major powers advocating the conclusion of a peace pact, and firmly supports it.
    The liberated Hungarian people believe that peace is the main prerequisite for their constructive labor, and they firmly advocate maintaining peace. Seven million Hungarians—almost all of our country's adults—have signed the peace pact declaration, which is proof of this. Therefore, the Hungarian government fully supports every effort aimed at easing international tensions. The Hungarian government steadfastly upholds the principle that different social systems can coexist peacefully if both sides are prepared and willing to cooperate. The Hungarian People's Republic sincerely hopes to participate in international cooperation, to live in a peaceful environment, and to maintain trade and cultural relations with all countries.
    The Hungarian government unconditionally agrees with the letter from the World People's Peace Congress to the governments of the five major powers because it expresses the vital interests of people all over the world.

    匈牙利支持缔结五大国和平公约的建议
    【新华社八日讯】据塔斯社布达佩斯七日讯：匈牙利通讯社报道：匈牙利外交部部长莫尔纳尔于六日写回信给维尔特博士、南尼和约里奥—居里三人，表示匈牙利政府同意他们要求匈牙利政府支持缔结五大国和平公约建议的来信。莫尔纳尔的信说：匈牙利政府诚挚地欢迎你们代表世界人民和平大会写给五大国主张缔结和平公约的信件，并且坚决支持它。
    解放了的匈牙利人民认为和平是他们进行建设性劳动的主要先决条件，他们坚决主张维护和平。匈牙利已有七百万人——几乎是我国全体成年人——在和平公约宣言上签了名，这就是一个证明。因此，匈牙利政府全力支持每一项以缓和国际紧张形势为目的的工作。匈牙利政府坚定不移地拥护这个原则：假如双方都准备并且愿意合作，不同的社会制度就能够和平共处。匈牙利人民共和国诚挚地希望参加国际合作，希望生活在和平的环境里，和一切国家保持贸易和文化关系。
    匈牙利政府无条件地同意世界人民和平大会致五大国政府书，因为它表达了全世界人民的切身利益。
