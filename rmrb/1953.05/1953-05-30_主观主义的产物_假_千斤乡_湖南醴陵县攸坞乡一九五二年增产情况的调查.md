On March 16th, I and two fellow journalists from the New Hunan Daily went to visit Youwu Township in the Eighth District of Liling County, Hunan. Before the visit, we were all immensely excited by the township's achievement of large-scale production increase. The responsible comrades in the county and district had both introduced to us that in 1952, the average rice yield per mu of paddy field in this township reached 1,001 jin.

We entered the township and explained our intentions to the township government secretary, Wen Qiuqing, and vice-chairman, Tan Yunqiu, among others. They repeatedly told us, "This is a thousand-jin township." That evening, we met with model mutual aid team leaders and labor models. However, this small座談会(zuò tán huì - forum/symposium) gave us a sense of an unusual atmosphere. The old farmer, Wang Qishou, who was said to have achieved a yield of over 1,000 jin per mu, sat in the corner, silent. Yao Jiayue, a production expert, asked Wang Zhilun, the model mutual aid team leader, in a mocking tone: "Do you think my yield is over 1,000 jin?" Wang Zhilun smiled but did not answer. The dim light revealed two farmers behind him giggling. Wang Zhilun talked about the yield of his mutual aid team: "The average yield of our mutual aid team is 1,012 jin per mu. Yes, it's true. However, the验收 (yàn shōu - acceptance check) was done on a rainy day, and the cadres were holding umbrellas and wearing raincoats while weighing."

The next day, we talked with the two model mutual aid team leaders of the township, Wang Zhilun and Wang Jilun, for a long time. Wang Jilun is a probationary party member, a simple and straightforward young farmer. Wang Zhilun seemed to be a capable and honest middle-aged farmer. They had already begun to realize that we had some doubts about the yield issue. Wang Zhilun said: "You're not just going to walk around here, ask for some materials, and then leave, are you? If you want the truth, I'll tell you about the 'thousand-jin white.'" Wang Jilun said: "The People's Daily published that Lin Qiumu's yield was fake, and we have more than one Lin Qiumu here!"

"Thousand-Jin White"

There is a "thousand-jin white" story circulating in the township. Before liberation, there was a landlord here named Tang Mingling, who had a "wide mouth," liked to boast, and often扯白 (chě bái - lie/brag). He said: "My mustard greens weigh ten jin per株(zhū - plant), and a hundred株 weigh a thousand jin in total." From then on, the farmers gave him the nickname "Thousand-Jin White." Now, the farmers are using "Thousand-Jin White" to satirize the "Thousand-Jin Township."

The "Thousand-Jin White" of the "Thousand-Jin Township" was "扯" (chě - fabricating) even before the spring plowing last year. At that time, Liling County blindly called for universally creating "thousand-jin households" and "thousand-jin townships," and blindly rejoiced that "more than 30,000 farmers in the county had signed up for thousand-jin production increase plans." The Liling County People's Government's first assignment of production increase tasks to the Eighth District last year was to reach an average of 700 jin per mu for the entire district, then it was increased to 750 jin, and finally to 800 jin. The Eighth District District Office and the Eighth District's Communist Party Committee accepted this blindly. They were not familiar with the local human and land resources and the characteristics of the small-scale peasant economy, and never conducted in-depth investigations and research, only relying on a set of methods of "calling," "mobilizing," and making a big fuss to "lead" production. Youwu Township was the key township of the Eighth District, and Wu Quanyou, the secretary of the District Committee of the Communist Party, and Nie Rengui, the district head, often came here. Last spring, when Wu Quanyou came to this township, he issued a "call" to the farmers: "We must oppose conservative thinking, and anyone who訂(dìng - plan/reserve) a yield of 1,500 jin of rice per mu will be given a subsidy of 60,000 yuan." The district and township cadres who led the township's production work, regardless of the local human and land conditions, universally called on farmers to "break conservative thinking" and訂"thousand-jin production increase plans." Thus, Wang Jilun and Wang Zhilun's two mutual aid teams took the lead in訂立(dìnglì - to draw up) plans for "an average yield of 1,000 jin and a maximum yield of 1,500 jin." In this way, the whole township was stirred up, and anyone who did not訂a "thousand-jin plan" had "conservative thinking." Li Xuanxi, an old farmer of seventy-eight years old, was criticized by the cadres as a "conservative typical example" because he did not訂a "thousand-jin plan." The old man turned around and was unconvinced: "Okay, you say I'm old-fashioned and want to change my old ways, then let's see your new ways of扯白!"

The harvest season arrived. Ding Bingyan, a member of the District Committee, stood by the paddy field, pointing here and there, and said with satisfaction: "Hmm, one thousand jin is not too little." The District Office wrote a report to the County Government saying: "The entire district, after evaluation and visits, decided that Shenfugang and Youwu townships are thousand-jin high-yield townships. ...The acceptance check of Shenfugang Township shows that it has completed the task of the thousand-jin township (Youwu Township has not yet completed the acceptance check)." The District Committee and the District Office had already recognized the two "thousand-jin townships" before the "acceptance check," and arranged the "thousand-jin township" acceptance check method. District Head Nie Rengui came back from Shenfugang Township after accepting the "thousand-jin township," turned around in Youwu Township, and said to the comrades who were doing the acceptance check: "Youwu will also become a thousand-jin township!"

Yang Houbin, a cadre sent by the County Agriculture and Forestry Bureau, was doing the "acceptance check" in Youwu Township. Yang Houbin and township cadres such as Tan Yunqiu selected some "high-yield fields" for acceptance check. It was raining, and the wet grain was weighed; moreover, the highest-yielding fields in each grade of land were selected as "representative fields" to estimate the yield of the entire township. That night, Yang Houbin found Li Zhiliang, a farmer who knew how to use an abacus, and others at the township government, and calculated until late at night, but the "one thousand jin" average yield of the entire township still could not be calculated on the abacus beads. Yang Houbin said to Li Zhiliang: "Add it up, add it up!" In the end, somehow the number "1,001 jin" appeared.

The Dishonorable "Award Flag"

The "thousand-jin white" was made. Wang Qishou was always very uncomfortable in his heart. Wang Qishou is an honest farmer who believes "one chi is ten cun," and the cadres accepted his high-yield demonstration field and said he was a "thousand-jin household," and later评(píng - appraised) him as a district labor model. Wang Qishou's average yield was actually only over 700 jin, and he had words in his heart that he could not speak. As a labor model, he felt guilty. He had never扯白 in his life, and this time he had "扯白." Every time there was a meeting and someone asked him to introduce his experience in increasing production, he always sat in the corner, silent, "unwilling to扯大白 (chě dà bái - to tell a big lie) in front of everyone." His mutual aid team also造了假 (zào le jiǎ - faked), and an elementary school teacher造(zào - make/build) a "底子(dǐzi - foundation)," which was placed with the team leader Wang Zhilun. The mutual aid team reads the newspaper every day, but everyone is beginning to doubt the high-yield news published in the newspapers in other regions.

Last winter, the county sent a red flag to reward the "thousand-jin township." The masses coldly "welcomed" it. Ding Bingyan, a member of the District Committee of the Communist Party in the Eighth District, issued his accustomed "call" on the坪(píng - open space) in front of the township government: "Comrades, we have won the red flag, we must add glory to glory, and victory to victory!" The masses whispered to each other: "Thousand-jin white, thousand-jin white." "扯白, not glorious."

Wang Zhilun has not been feeling well since the mutual aid team造了假. He thought: "The cadres want fake, the farmers make fake, and the government believes fake, isn't this becoming a fake society, a fake world!" He never understood why it had to be this way. He thought: "Maybe the government wants fake this year to encourage the production upsurge; next year it won't want fake again, right?" "Alas, the revolution is not thorough enough yet, people still have fake ideas!"

Li Xuanxi, an old farmer with a somewhat "rigid" mind, has become even more unconvinced that "thousand-jin production increase" can be achieved since the "thousand-jin white" came out. His "old ways" seemed to have a basis. He said: "Thousand-jin township can only be thousand-jin white, a thousand jin for the whole township, will never be achieved!"

"Thousand-jin white" has fueled his conservative thinking.

Wang Jilun was originally the patriotic production increase banner of the Eighth District, a model mutual aid team leader. After "扯白," he watched his and his mutual aid team's prestige among the masses decline, and the party branch's prestige also suffered losses. The masses said: "Labor model, get a red flag by 扯白!" Some farmers gossiped: "The People's Government is实实在在 (shí shí zài zài - honest/truthful) in everything else, but they like to扯白 in the matter of production." "Those with wide mouths and big胆子 (dǎnzi - courage) will get ahead!" Wang Jilun increasingly felt that扯白 was wrong, and was sorry to the Party and Chairman Mao. He finally bravely and frankly exposed the "thousand-jin white" to reporters, saying that his average yield was only over 700 jin, and the yield of the entire mutual aid team was about the same. In the entire team's more than 50 mu of paddy fields, there were indeed "thousand-jin丘(qiū - plots)," but the area was very small; on average, there were only over 700 jin.

Terrible Subjectivism

The entire District Committee and District Office were shrouded in an atmosphere of subjectivism. Ding Bingyan was responsible for "cultivating key points" in Youwu Township, but he seemed not to have even heard of the "thousand-jin white" that was circulating among the masses. After our first visit to Youwu Township, we reported the false yield situation to Wu Quanyou, the secretary of the District Committee. After the reporters left, he went to conduct an "investigation" with a sense of "injustice." He found Wang Jilun and asked: "How much is your yield after all?" Wang Jilun frankly said: "My yield is only over 700 jin. In the past, I扯白, and was not honest with the Party. I am willing to accept the Party's punishment; but the cadres also have a responsibility!" The District Committee Secretary completely did not consider, let alone believe, Wang Jilun's sincere self-criticism. After talking to several cadres individually, he convened a座談会 of old farmers and model mutual aid team leaders. Wang Zhilun and Li Zhi'en all said that their yield was only over 700 jin, not 1,000 jin. Tang Shunsheng, who looked to see which way the wind blew, said: "Taking my yield as an example, even if the entire township doesn't have 1,000 jin, it has over 900 jin!" He said that his average yield was over 900 jin, but he reported a harvest volume and then reported the number of田亩(tiánmǔ - fields/acres), which calculated to only 800 jin; he "缩了口(suō le kǒu - clammed up)" on the spot. After the座談会 dispersed, the District Committee Secretary left several party members to talk, and he said: "According to our investigation, the average yield of this township, even if it's not 1,000 jin, is over 900 jin." This is how the District Committee Secretary completed his "investigation."

The method of leading production by subjectivism and formalism continued to be implemented. The township convened a government committee, presided over by District Head Nie, to discuss and approve the 1953 production plan for Youwu Township (which had been merged with Nantang Township). The plan stipulated that the average yield for the entire township was 1,000 jin, on the grounds that the average yield of old Youwu Township last year was "1,000 jin"; the验收 yield of the newly merged Nantang Township last year was "over 800 jin," so the average yield of new Youwu Township last year should be "over 900 jin," so it should reach 1,000 jin this year. And it was stipulated that each mu of field should be applied with 90担(dàn - a unit of weight, about 50kg) of mixed fertilizer. During the discussion on the township government committee, committee member Wang Julun (a farmer) raised objections. He said: "First, the plan for an average yield of 1,000 jin for the new Youwu Township is not realistic, because the yield of old Youwu Township last year was fake; second, each mu of field can be applied with a maximum average of 50 or 60 担 of fertilizer, and 90 担 is放空炮(fàng kōng pào - empty talk/brag)." As a result, the plan was not approved. When the District Committee Secretary heard about this situation, he rushed to Wang Julun's house and said to him in a stern voice: "The production plan that was decided by the township branch and approved by the district, how dare you, Wang Julun, raise objections and not pass it!"

Ding Bingyan was again "calling" on farmers to订"thousand-jin production increase plans." He stood high and issued his accustomed "call": "Everyone come and enthusiastically challenge and compete, create an upsurge, and订out奋斗(fèndòu - striving) goals!" Thus, the "thousand-jin production increase plans" were订by the party members. They were贴(tiē - pasted) all over the walls inside the township government, almost every plan began with "responding to the government's call" and ended with "doing what we say, not放空炮." The plan of Wang Jilun's mutual aid team wrote that this year's "average yield is 1,000 jin," and "each mu will increase production by 75 jin compared to last year." In fact, the average yield of the entire team last year was only over 700 jin.

Tearing Up the "Thousand-Jin White"

After the Hunan Provincial Committee of the Communist Party received the reporters' report, in order to find out the "底子(dǐzi - foundation)" of Hunan Province's production increase last year, and to make the Provincial Committee "心中有数(xīn zhōng yǒu shù - to have a clear understanding)," it dispatched an investigation team, led by Comrade Zhou Jishun (former secretary of the Liling County Committee of the Communist Party), director of the Third Division of the Rural Work Department of the Provincial Committee, to conduct an investigation in Youwu Township, Liling, combined with inspection of production. The reporters also participated in this investigation. The investigation team arrived in the Eighth District of Liling on April 11. The District Committee Secretary Wu Quanyou first reported his "investigation" results. According to his analysis: "The masses have conservative thinking and are trying to lower the perennial yield, so they deliberately want to report the yield low. Based on the natural conditions and the high-yield movement last year, if the acceptance check is accurate, the yield of this township would be 1,000 jin; but there are problems with the acceptance check, so we can't be sure of the yield of this township. There is a Wang Julun in this township; the masses deliberately reported the yield low, and he is actively鼓动(gǔdòng - instigating)." Thus, he described Wang Julun, the farmer who dared to raise objections, as a "三头六臂的人物(sān tóu liù bì de rénwù - a powerful/influential figure)," saying how Wang Julun made trouble on the township government committee, so that the entire township's "thousand-jin production increase plan" could not be passed. District Head Nie Rengui introduced several "high-yield" numbers. They did not mention a word about the yield situation reflected by Wang Jilun, Wang Zhilun, and Li Zhi'en.

On April 12, the comrades of the investigation team went to the countryside. We worked separately every day and reported collectively. District Committee Secretary Wu Quanyou was so unable to calmly and realistically think about the actual situation placed before him. When the comrades of the investigation team reported examples of lower yields, he said: "These are poor fields!" When someone talked about Wang Jilun's yield of over 700 jin, he said: "This is nonsense!" The third day, he and Comrade Zhou Jishun went together to visit Yao Jiayue, the "thousand-jin household" whom he believed was most likely to coincide with his wishes. He called Zuo Gengyun, the organizational member of the branch, to find Yao Jiayue, and said to Yao: "You are the highest high-yield household in the township. Now, District Committee Wu is looking for you to talk about the yield, you have to斟酌斟酌(zhēn zhuó zhēn zhuó - consider carefully) oh!" Yao Jiayue came, and he reported the yield of each丘 of his field, "over 900 jin, over 1,000 jin..." Wu Quanyou excitedly recorded these numbers. He said to Comrade Zhou Jishun: "I think the average yield of the entire township, even if it's not 1,000 jin, is over 900 jin." On the morning of the fourth day, Wu Quanyou reported his "investigation" results at the meeting of the investigation team. On the morning of the fifth day, other comrades used materials confirmed from all sides to overturn his "investigation." It turned out that Yao Jiayue, who was considered by the District Committee to be the "highest high-yield household" in the entire township, had an average yield of less than 900 jin last year; "over 1,000 jin" was again扯白.

The farmers warmly welcomed and supported our investigation. They said: "The People's Government is really实实在在, not fake at all." The old farmer Wang Qishou invited reporters to his house and took out his economic income and expenditure account books for the past few years (he is known far and wide for his detailed bookkeeping). He put on his old glasses and helped us calculate detailed accounts under the dim light. (The result of the calculation was that his 14 mu 7 fen 7 li of paddy fields had an average yield of 739 jin 15 liang per mu last year.) The farmers were very willing to listen to the logic that "thousand-jin white" is not conducive to the state's formulation of construction plans. They said: "Yes, if everyone扯白, how can Chairman Mao订大计划 (dìng dà jì huà - make big plans)!"

The investigation team comprehensively studied the materials, and the time was ripe for making a conclusion. The members of the team investigated for a total of nine days, visiting 55 peasant households (accounting for 15% of the total number of households in the township), including 16 middle peasants, 37 hired and poor peasants, and 2 other classes; 10 party and团员(tuányuán - league member); 13 township and village cadres; 9 labor models; 15 single farmers, 32 mutual aid team members, and 8 mutual aid team leaders), listening to their opinions on production and yield issues. Comrade Zhou Jishun treated this investigation with a realistic and practical attitude. He said to the members of the investigation team (most of whom were cadres from this county): "Regarding the yield issue, I also have a responsibility for leading the work of this county last year, and now we must seriously treat the Party's task." On the last day, the investigation team studied the situation regarding the yield issue, analyzed the natural conditions of this township, and repeatedly checked and affirmed the average yield of 15 representative farmers in the township in 1952. Based on such investigation and research, Comrade Zhou Jishun made a preliminary conclusion: the yield of Youwu Township in 1952 increased compared to 1951, but there was not a single "thousand-jin household," and the average yield of the three model mutual aid teams was only over 700 jin.

On the evening of April 19, a党员大会 (dǎngyuán dàhuì - party member meeting) of the entire township was convened. Comrade Zhou Jishun reported the investigation summary to the branch and the District Committee, and announced that "the truth about the 'thousand-jin white' has been revealed."

District Committee Secretary Wu Quanyou was shocked when he heard the conclusion of "over 700 jin." In the face of facts, the subjectivists began to wake up. But he still couldn't figure out: "It's strange, why didn't the masses tell us (the District Committee members) the truth?" The answer to this question requires him to find it out himself among the masses.

    主观主义的产物——假“千斤乡”
    ——湖南醴陵县攸坞乡一九五二年增产情况的调查
    冯之丹
    三月十六日，我和新湖南报的二位记者同志一起去访问湖南醴陵县第八区的攸坞乡。访问之前，我们都为这个乡的大面积增产的成绩感到无限兴奋。县里和区里的负责同志都给我们介绍：一九五二年，这个乡平均每亩水稻田的稻子产量达到一千零一斤。
    我们走进这个乡，向乡政府秘书文秋清、副主席谭云秋等说明来意。她们也再三告诉我们说：“这是千斤乡。”当天夜晚，我们便和模范互助组长、劳动模范们会了面。这个小型座谈会却使我们感到一种异样的气氛。那个据说每亩产量达到一千多斤的老农民汪其寿坐在屋角里，不吭气。生产能手姚甲月用戏谑的语气向模范互助组长汪志伦问道：“你看，我的产量是不是一千多斤呢？”汪志伦笑了一下，不作声。暗淡的灯火照见他的背后有两个农民也在嘻笑。汪志伦谈到他的互助组的产量：“我们互助组的平均产量是每亩一千零一十二斤。是啊，确实的。不过，不过验收时是下雨天，干部打着伞，披着蓑衣秤的。”
    第二天，我们又找这个乡的两个模范互助组长汪志伦和汪纪伦谈了很久。汪纪伦是候补党员，一个朴实、坦直的青年农民。汪志伦看来是一个能干而诚实的中年农民。他们已开始觉察到我们对产量问题有些怀疑了。汪志伦说：“你们不是到这里转一下身，问一下材料就走的吧？你们要是喜欢真情实事，我就告诉你们‘千斤白’。”汪纪伦说：“人民日报登了林求姆的产量是假的，我们这里不止一个林求姆哩！”
    “千斤白”
    乡里流传着一个“千斤白”的故事。这里解放前有个地主叫汤明令，他有一张“宽嘴巴”，喜欢夸耀自己，经常扯白（吹牛）。他说：“我家的芥菜，一蔸就重十斤，一担百蔸重千斤。”农民们从此就送他一个外号叫“千斤白”。现在，农民们就拿“千斤白”来讽喻“千斤乡”。
    “千斤乡”的“千斤白”是从去年春耕以前就“扯”起的。那时节，醴陵县盲目地号召普遍搞“千斤户”“千斤乡”，盲目地为“全县有三万多农民订立了千斤增产计划”而高兴。醴陵县人民政府去年第一次分配第八区的增产任务是全区每亩平均达到七百斤，后来加到七百五十斤，最后又加到八百斤。第八区区公所和第八区的中共党委都闭着眼睛接受了。他们并不熟悉当地的人力和地力情况及小农经济的特点，从来没有进行过深入的调查研究，只是凭着“号召”“动员”、大轰大擂的一套办法“领导”生产。攸坞乡是第八区的重点乡，中共区委书记武全友和区长聂仁贵经常到这里来。去年春天，武全友到这个乡时，向农民发出了“号召”：“我们要反对保守思想，凡是订出每亩田产量达到一千五百斤稻谷的，发给六万元补助费。”领导这个乡的生产工作的区、乡干部，不顾当地的人力和地力条件，普遍号召农民“打破保守思想”，订“千斤增产计划”。于是汪纪伦、汪志伦两个互助组带头订立了
    “平均产量一千斤、最高产量一千五百斤”的计划。这样，全乡都轰动起来，谁不订“千斤计划”，谁就有“保守思想”。七十八岁的老农民黎煊希被干部们批评为“保守典型”，因为他不订“千斤计划”。这个佬佬背转身就不服气：“好吧，你们说我老古板，要换换我的老章程，就看看你们扯白的新章程！”
    秋收的季节到来了。区委委员丁炳炎站在稻田边，指指这里，又指指那里，得意地说：“嗯，一千斤不得少了。”区公所给县政府写了一个报告说：“全区经过评比参观，决定了神福港、攸坞两乡为千斤丰产乡。……神福港乡验收结果，已完成千斤乡的任务（攸坞乡还未验收完）。”区委会和区公所在“验收”前就已认定了两个“千斤乡”，并布置了“千斤乡”的验收办法。区长聂仁贵从神福港验收了“千斤乡”回来，到攸坞乡打了一个转身，向验收的同志们说：“攸坞也要成个千斤乡哩！”
    县农林局派来的干部杨厚斌在攸坞乡“验收”。杨厚斌和乡干部谭云秋等选了一些“丰产田”验收。天正下雨，秤了湿谷子；而且是在每一个等级的田亩中选了最高产量的田做“代表田”，来推算全乡的产量。那天夜晚，杨厚斌把会打算盘的农民黎之良等找到乡政府，算到深夜，全乡“一千斤”平均产量在算盘珠上还是打不出来。杨厚斌向黎之良说：“加上去，加上去！”最后不知怎的就出现了“一千零一斤”的数字。
    不光荣的“奖旗”
    “千斤白”做出来了。汪其寿的心里始终很难受。汪其寿是个“一尺就是十寸”的老实农民，干部验收了他的丰产示范田，说他是“千斤户”，后来又评他是区劳动模范。汪其寿的平均产量实在只有七百多斤，他心里有话开不得口，当了劳动模范，内心有愧。他生来都没扯过“白”，这回“扯白”了。每次开会有人请他介绍增产经验，他总是坐在屋角里，不作声，“不愿意当着众人扯大白”。他那个互助组也造了假，小学教员给他们造了一个
    “底子”，放在组长汪志伦那里。互助组内天天读报，但是大家都怀疑起报纸上登载的别的地区的丰产消息了。
    去年冬天，县里送来了一面奖励“千斤乡”的红旗子。群众冷冷淡淡地“迎接”了它。第八区的中共区委委员丁炳炎在乡政府门口的坪上发出了他所习惯的“号召”：“同志们，我们夺取了红旗子，我们要光荣再加光荣，胜利再加胜利！”群众低声地交谈着：“千斤白，千斤白。”“扯白，不光荣。”
    汪志伦自从互助组造了假，也感到不好过。他这样想：“干部要假的，农民造假的，政府就信假的，这不成了假社会，假世界！”他总不理解为什么要这样。他想：“也许是政府今年要假的，来鼓励鼓励生产热潮；明年就不会再要假的了吧。”“唉，如今革命还不彻底，人还有假思想呵！”
    脑筋有些“古板”的老农民黎煊希，自从出了“千斤白”以后，就更不相信“千斤增产”是能够达到的了。他的“老章程”似乎有了根据。他说：    “千斤乡只能是千斤白，全乡一千斤，永远也达不到！”
    “千斤白”助长了他的保守思想。
    汪纪伦原是第八区的爱国增产旗帜，模范互助组长。“扯白”以后，他眼看着自己和互助组在群众中的威信降低了，党支部的威信也受了损失。群众说：“劳动模范喽，想扯白得红旗子喽！”有的农民风言风语地说：“人民政府别的事情实实在在，就是产量的事喜欢扯白的。”“那个嘴巴宽，胆子大，就吃得开啊！”汪纪伦越来越感到扯白不对，对不起党和毛主席。他终于向记者勇敢地、坦率地揭穿了“千斤白”，说出他的平均产量只有七百多斤，全互助组产量也差不多，全组五十多亩水稻田中，的确有“千斤丘”，但是面积很小；平均起来只有七百多斤。
    可怕的主观主义
    整个区委和区公所被主观主义的氛围所笼罩着。丁炳炎在攸坞乡负责“培养重点”，但他对于群众流传着的“千斤白”的说法好像连听都没有听到过。我们第一次访问攸坞乡后，向区委书记武全友反映了假产量的情况。在记者们走了之后，他就带着“不平”的情绪去进行“调查”。他找到汪纪伦问道：“你的产量究竟多少啊？”汪纪伦直率地说：“我的产量只有七百多斤，过去我扯白，对党不老实，甘愿受党的处分；但是干部也有责任的！”区委书记完全不考虑、更不相信汪纪伦的诚恳的检讨。他找了几个干部个别谈话之后，召开老农民，模范互助组长的座谈会。汪志伦、黎之恩他们都说自己的产量只有七百多斤，没有一千斤。看风使舵的汤顺生说：“拿我的产量来说，全乡没有一千斤也有九百多！”他说他的平均产量是九百多斤，但是他报了个收获量，又报了田亩数，算下来，却只有八百斤；当场便“缩了口”。座谈会散了，区委书记留下几个党员谈话，他说：    “据我们调查，这个乡的平均产量没有一千斤也有九百多斤。”区委书记就这样“调查”完了。
    主观主义、形式主义的领导生产的办法照旧在实行着。乡里召开了政府委员会，由聂区长主持，讨论和通过一九五三年的攸坞乡（已和南塘乡合并）生产计划。计划规定全乡平均产量是一千斤，理由是，老攸坞乡去年平均产量“一千斤”；新并入的南塘乡去年验收产量是    “八百多斤”，新攸坞乡去年平均产量应该是    “九百多斤”，因此今年要达到一千斤。并且每亩田规定要施混合肥料九十担。在乡政府委员会上讨论时，委员汪菊伦（农民）提出了反对意见。他说：“第一，新攸坞乡平均产量一千斤的计划不实在，因为去年老攸坞乡的产量是假的；第二，每亩田平均最多施肥五、六十担，九十担是放空炮。”结果计划没有通过。区委书记听了这个情况，赶到汪菊伦家里，严声厉色地对他说：“乡支部决议的，区里批准的生产计划，你汪菊伦竟敢提意见，通不过！”
    丁炳炎又在“号召”农民订立“千斤增产计划”了。他站得高高地发出了他所习惯的“号召”：“大家来热烈挑战竞赛，造成热潮，订出奋斗目标来！”于是“千斤增产计划”由党员们带头订出来了。在乡政府里面的墙上贴得满满的，几乎每个计划都是以“响应政府号召”开始，以“说到做到，不放空炮”收尾。汪纪伦互助组的计划上写着今年“平均产量一千斤”，    “每亩比去年增产七十五斤”。其实，全组去年的平均产量只有七百多斤。
    撕破“千斤白”
    中共湖南省委得到了记者们反映的情况以后，为了摸清湖南省去年增产的“底子”，使省委“心中有数”，派出了调查组，由省委农村工作部第三处处长周继舜同志（前中共醴陵县委书记）领导，结合检查生产，去醴陵攸坞乡进行调查。记者也参加了这次调查工作。调查组在四月十一日到了醴陵第八区。区委书记武全友就首先报告他的“调查”结果。按照他的分析是：“群众有保守思想，企图降低常年产量，因此故意要把产量报低。根据自然条件和去年丰产运动情况，如果验收准确，这个乡的产量一千斤是会有的；但是验收有毛病，因此，不能肯定这个乡的产量。这个乡有个汪菊伦；群众故意把产量报得低，是他在积极鼓动。”于是，他把汪菊伦这个敢提意见的农民形容为“三头六臂的人物”，说汪菊伦如何在乡政府委员会上捣乱，使全乡的“千斤增产计划”不能通过。区长聂仁贵介绍了几个“高额产量”的数字。他们对汪纪伦、汪志伦、黎之恩所反映的产量情况，一个字都不提。
    四月十二日，调查组的同志们下乡了。我们每天分头工作，集中汇报。区委书记武全友是那样不能冷静地、实事求是地去思考摆在他面前的实际情况。当调查组的同志汇报了较低产量的例子时，他说：
    “这是差田！”当有人谈到汪纪伦的七百多斤产量时，他说：“这是胡说八道！”第三天，他和周继舜同志一起去访问他所认为最能吻合他的愿望的
    “千斤户”姚甲月。他叫支部组织委员左耕云去找姚甲月，对姚说：“你是全乡的最高丰产户，现在武区委找你去谈产量，你要斟酌斟酌噢！”姚甲月来了，他报了他的每丘田的产量，“九百多斤，一千多斤……”，武全友兴奋地记下了这些数字。他对周继舜同志说：“我看全乡平均产量，没有一千斤，也有九百斤。”第四天清晨，武全友在调查组的会议上汇报了他的“调查”结果。第五天的早晨，别的同志就用从各方面证实的材料，推翻了他的
    “调查”。原来被区委认为是全乡“最高丰产户”的姚甲月去年平均产量还不到九百斤；“一千多斤”又是扯白的。
    农民们热情地欢迎和支持我们的调查。他们说：“人民政府真是实实在在，一点也不假的。”老农民汪其寿把记者邀到他的房子里，把他几年来的经济收支账本都拿出来（他记账精细是远近闻名的）。他戴上老光眼镜，在暗淡的灯光下，帮我们算细账。（算的结果，他的十四亩七分七厘水稻田，去年每亩平均产量是七百三十九斤十五两。）农民们很愿意听“千斤白”不利于国家制订建设计划的道理。他们说：“是啊，大家扯白，毛主席怎能订大计划！”
    调查组综合、研究了材料，作出结论的时机成熟了。组员们共调查了九天，访问了五十五户农民
    （占全乡总户数的百分之十五），其中有中农十六户，雇农、贫农三十七户，其它阶层二户；党团员十人；乡、村干部十三人；劳动模范九人；单干农民十五人，互助组组员三十二人，互助组长八人），听取了他们对生产和产量问题的意见。周继舜同志用实事求是的态度对待了这次调查。他向调查组员们（大都是本县干部）说：    “对于产量问题，我去年领导这个县的工作，我也有责任，现在我们必须严肃地去对待党的任务。”最后一天，调查组研究了有关产量问题的情况，分析了这个乡的自然条件，并反复核对和肯定了全乡具有代表性的十五户农民在一九五二年的平均产量。根据这样的调查研究，周继舜同志作了初步结论：攸坞乡一九五二年的产量是比一九五一年增加了，可是并没有一个“千斤户”，三个模范互助组的平均产量只有七百多斤。
    四月十九日晚上，召开了全乡的党员大会。周继舜同志向支部及区委报告了调查总结，宣布    “‘千斤白’真相大白了”。
    区委书记武全友听到“七百多斤”的结论，大吃一惊。在事实面前，主观主义者开始清醒了。但是他还弄不明白：“很奇怪，为什么群众不向我们（区委委员们）说真话呢？”这个问题的答案，需要他自己到群众中去找出来。
