    The Sino-Japanese Friendship Association will convene its third national congress in Tokyo on May 30th and 31st. The convening of this congress will further develop the work of the Sino-Japanese Friendship Association, which has been established for nearly three years, and will further promote the increasingly widespread Sino-Japanese friendship movement.
    The Sino-Japanese Friendship Association is a mass organization formed by the Japanese people to promote friendship between the peoples of Japan and China. Its birth and growth are closely related to the great victory of the Chinese people and the increasingly high tide of the Japanese people's movement to strengthen friendship with the Chinese people and consolidate peace. Since the Chinese people achieved victory throughout the country and established the People's Republic of China, people from all walks of life in Japan have increasingly hoped to establish friendly relations between the peoples of China and Japan. Under these circumstances, prominent Japanese figures such as Ikuo Oyama, Yoshitaro Hirano, Kanzo Uchiyama, Aijiro Ogawa, and Keishi Hoashi initiated a preparatory meeting for the Sino-Japanese Friendship Association on January 13, 1950. After more than half a year of active preparation, with the support of people from all walks of life in Japan, the inaugural meeting of the Sino-Japanese Friendship Association was held in Tokyo on September 30th and October 1st of the same year. At that time, there were more than 1,000 participants, including representatives from more than 20 groups, including the All-Japan Federation of Industrial Unions, the General Council of Trade Unions of Japan, the Sino-Japanese Trade Promotion Association, the General Association of Chinese Overseas in Japan, the China Research Institute, and the General Association of Chinese Students Studying in Japan. The congress adopted the program of the Sino-Japanese Friendship Association: to promote friendship between the peoples of China and Japan to contribute to world peace, to correct the erroneous views on China created by reactionaries, and to promote cultural exchange and independent trade between the two countries.
    The American and Japanese reactionaries have persecuted this organization, which promotes friendship between the peoples of China and Japan, from the very beginning. For example, they instructed the reactionary Japanese newspapers to maliciously slander the Sino-Japanese Friendship Association; at the instigation of the "Japan Federation of Employers' Associations," an organization of Japanese Zaibatsu, Mitsui Mining dismissed employees who participated in the Sino-Japanese Friendship Association without justification in October 1950; in November and December of the same year, the Japanese police authorities in Osaka and Tokyo illegally searched the Osaka branch of the Sino-Japanese Friendship Association and the Tokyo headquarters of the Sino-Japanese Friendship Association, and successively arrested five people, including Masamoto Ozawa, the secretary-general of the Sino-Japanese Friendship Association. Finally, they were handed over to the American military court on the "crime" of "slandering" the American occupying forces, and were brutally sentenced to imprisonment.
    Despite the fact that the American and Japanese reactionaries used many despicable means to persecute the Sino-Japanese Friendship Association, the Japanese people's desire to be friendly with the Chinese people is irresistible. The Sino-Japanese Friendship Association has continued to grow in the struggle against persecution. As of September 1952, the branches and preparatory branches of the Sino-Japanese Friendship Association throughout the country had developed to 88, and in particular, the participation rate of trade union organizations was increasing day by day.
    On April 12, 1952, the Sino-Japanese Friendship Association convened its second national congress, summarized its work, and determined the work policy for 1952: to promote Sino-Japanese trade, strengthen cultural exchanges, fight against malicious propaganda that slanders China, strengthen friendship with Chinese overseas in Japan, and promote peace with China. The congress recommended Akira Kazami as the president of the Sino-Japanese Friendship Association, and elected Yoshio Toyoshima, Hyo Hara, and Yoshitaro Hirano as vice presidents, Kanzo Uchiyama as director-general, and Sachiko Ikeda, Tsugimaro Imanaka, Hisao Kuroda, Kinkazu Saionji, Michio Iwamura, Kenjuro Yanagida, Tokutaro Kitamura, Tomi Takara, Keishi Hoashi, Kisuke Miyakoshi, Karoku Hosokawa, Yukizo Abe, Kumaichi Yamamoto, and Hideo Sakurai as ninety-six directors. After this congress, the Sino-Japanese Friendship Association further extensively carried out various activities.
    In the past nearly three years, the Sino-Japanese Friendship Association has done a lot of work and achieved certain results in increasing friendship between the peoples of China and Japan. In terms of introducing the achievements of New China and the lives of the Chinese people, the Sino-Japanese Friendship Association has published publications such as "Japan and China" and "China Affairs," as well as other pamphlets. In terms of introducing Chinese revolutionary theories, it has translated and edited "Selected Works of Mao Zedong," "Collected Essays of Liu Shaoqi," "A Brief History of the Communist Party of China," and "History of the New Democratic Revolution in China." In terms of cultural exchange, it has translated many famous Chinese literary works such as Guo Moruo's "Qu Yuan," Zhao Shuli's "Changes in Li Village," and Ding Ling's "The Sun Shines Over the Sanggan River," and established the "Friends of Chinese Art Association," and also held Chinese painting exhibitions and singing concerts in various places, and screened Chinese films such as "Liberated China," "The Victory of the Chinese People," and "The White-Haired Girl." The Sino-Japanese Friendship Association has also held many lectures on Chinese issues in various places. In terms of promoting Sino-Japanese trade, the Sino-Japanese Friendship Association frequently publishes articles in "Japan and China" and publishes publications such as "Korean Armistice and Sino-Japanese Trade" and "Sino-Japanese Trade Newsletter," opposes the U.S. implementation of "embargoes," and promotes the Sino-Japanese trade movement. Before and after the signing of the "Sino-Japanese Trade Agreement" in June 1952, the efforts of the Sino-Japanese Friendship Association in this regard were great. In addition, the Sino-Japanese Friendship Association has also done a lot of work in assisting Japanese overseas Chinese in China with remittances and returning to their home countries. Activities such as collecting the remains of Chinese prisoners of war in the Hanaoka Massacre, holding memorial services for the death of Lu Xun, and the Sino-Japanese Friendship Month in September and October last year were all beneficial to the friendship between the peoples of China and Japan.
    The Sino-Japanese Friendship Association is also an active participant in the Japanese people's movement to strive for peace and independence. The Sino-Japanese Friendship Association has carried out active activities in the movements against the San Francisco Peace Treaty and the separate peace treaty between Japan and Chiang Kai-shek, against rearmament, demanding the conclusion of a fair peace treaty including China, and participating in the Asian and Pacific Regional Peace Conference.
    These propaganda and activities of the Sino-Japanese Friendship Association have enabled the Japanese people to have a further understanding of New China and have promoted the ever-developing friendship between the peoples of China and Japan.
    Today, as the Sino-Japanese friendship movement is rising higher and higher among the Japanese people, the convening of the third national congress of the Sino-Japanese Friendship Association is of great significance. As the Sino-Japanese Friendship Association pointed out in its notice for the convening of this meeting: "Now Sino-Japanese friendship has become the enthusiastic call of the people in every corner of the country. The third national congress convened under this situation bears the historical task of making this movement flourish and move forward." (Xinhua News Agency)

    为促进日中两国人民的友谊而努力的日中友好协会
    日中友好协会即将在五月三十日和三十一日在东京召开第三届全国大会。这次大会的召开，将使成立将近三年的日中友协的工作获得进一步的发展，并将进一步推动日益开展的日中友好运动。
    日中友好协会是日本人民为促进日中两国人民的友谊而组织的群众团体。它的诞生和成长，是和中国人民的伟大胜利及日本人民要求和中国人民加强友谊与巩固和平的日益高涨的运动，密切相关的。自从中国人民在全国范围内取得胜利并建立了中华人民共和国以后，日本各阶层人民愈来愈热烈地希望建立中日两国人民的友好关系。在这种情况之下，日本的著名人士大山郁夫、平野义太郎、内山完造、小川爱次郎、帆足计等，在一九五○年一月十三日发起召开了日中友好协会筹备会议。经过大半年的积极筹备，在日本各阶层人民的支持之下，于同年九月三十日和十月一日在东京举行了日中友好协会成立大会。当时参加者约千余人，包括全日本产业别工会会议、日本工会总评议会、中日贸易促进会、留日华侨总会、中国研究所、中国留日同学总会等二十余团体的代表。大会通过日中友协的纲领是：促进日中两国人民的友谊以贡献于世界和平，纠正反动派所造成的对中国的错误观点，促进两国文化交流和自主贸易。
    美、日反动派对这个促进中日两国人民友好的团体，自始就横加迫害。例如，指使日本反动报纸对日中友协进行了恶毒的诬蔑；三井矿山于一九五○年十月在日本财阀组织“日本经营者团体联盟”的指使下，对参加日中友协的职工无理解雇；同年十一月和十二月，大阪和东京的日本警察当局非法搜查了日中友协大阪分会和东京日中友协本部，并先后逮捕了日中友协事务局长小泽正元等五人。最后竟以“诽谤”美国占领军的“罪名”，把他们移交美国军事法庭，横暴地判处徒刑。
    尽管美、日反动派用许多卑鄙手段来迫害日中友好协会，但是，日本人民要求和中国人民友好的意愿是不可阻挡的。日中友好协会在反迫害的斗争中不断地成长起来。截至一九五二年九月，日中友协在全国的分会及筹备分会，已经发展到八十八个，特别是工会团体的参加比率日在增加。
    一九五二年四月十二日，日中友协召开了第二届全国大会，总结了工作，并确定了一九五二年的工作方针是：促进中日贸易、加强文化交流、同诬蔑中国的恶毒宣传作斗争、加强与在日华侨的友好、促进与中国的媾和等。大会推荐风见章为日中友协会长，选出丰岛与志雄、原彪、平野义太郎三人为副会长，内山完造为理事长，池田幸子、今中次麿、黑田寿男、西园寺公一、岩村三千夫、柳田谦十郎、北村德太郎、高良富、帆足计、宫腰喜助、细川嘉六、阿部行藏、山本熊一、樱井英雄等九十六名理事。在这次大会以后，日中友协进一步广泛地展开了各种活动。
    将近三年来，日中友好协会在增进日中两国人民友谊方面作了很多工作，取得了一定的成绩。在介绍新中国的成就及中国人民生活方面，日中友协出版有“日本与中国”、“中国事情”等刊物以及其他小册子。在介绍中国革命学说方面，翻译和编辑了“毛泽东选集”、“刘少奇论文集”、“中国共产党小史”、“中国新民主主义革命史”等。在文化交流方面，翻译了郭沫若的“屈原”、赵树理的“李家庄的变迁”、丁玲的“太阳照在桑乾河上”等许多著名的中国文学作品，并成立了“中国美术之友会”，还在各地举行中国画片展览和歌唱会，放映“解放了的中国”、“中国人民的胜利”、“白毛女”等中国影片。日中友协也在各地举行过多次有关中国问题的讲座。在促进日中贸易方面，日中友协经常在“日本与中国”上发表论文，并发行“朝鲜停战与中日贸易”、“中日贸易通讯”等刊物，反对美国实施“禁运”，推动中日贸易运动。一九五二年六月“中日贸易协议”签订前后，日中友协在这方面的努力是很大的。除此以外，在协助在华日侨汇款和归国等问题上，日中友协也作了很多工作。又如收殓花冈惨案中国俘虏遗骨，举行鲁迅逝世纪念会，及去年九、十月间的日中友好月等都是有益于中日两国人民友好的活动。
    日中友好协会也是日本人民争取和平与独立运动的积极参加者。在反对旧金山和约和日蒋单独媾和、反对重新武装、要求缔结包括中国在内的公正和约、参加亚洲及太平洋区域和平会议等运动中，日中友协都进行了积极的活动。
    日中友好协会的这些宣传和活动，使日本人民对新中国有了进一步的认识，促进了日中两国人民日益发展着的友情。
    在日中友好运动在日本人民中间一天天高涨的今天，日中友好协会第三届全国大会的召开，是具有重大意义的。正如日中友协在它为召开这次会议而发出的通知书中所指出：“现在日中友好已在全国每一个角落成为人民的热烈呼声。在这种形势下召开的第三届全国大会，负有使这个运动蓬勃向前发展的历史任务。”（新华社）
