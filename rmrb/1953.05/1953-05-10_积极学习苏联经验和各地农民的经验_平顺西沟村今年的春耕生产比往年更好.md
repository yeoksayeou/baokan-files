Actively Learn from Soviet Experience and the Experience of Farmers in Various Regions
This Year's Spring Plowing Production in Xigou Village, Pingshun, is Better Than in Previous Years

This year, under the leadership of labor model Li Shunda, the farmers of Xigou Village, Pingshun County, Shanxi Province, actively responded to Chairman Mao's call to learn from the advanced experience of the Soviet Union in building the country, and demonstrated many new characteristics in spring plowing production.

The Li Shunda Agricultural, Forestry, and Animal Husbandry Production Cooperative, based on its own actual conditions, learned from the reward and punishment system of the Soviet October Victory Collective Farm (Li Shunda specifically visited this farm when he visited the Soviet Union last year) to strengthen the members' sense of responsibility to the cooperative. After the cooperative implemented the "four-fixed contract labor" system in 1952, although the production enthusiasm of the members was significantly improved, some members had a tendency to compete for work and not pay attention to technology. Production outside the scope of everyone's contract labor often had problems and no one took care of it, which could not better guarantee increased production. After learning from the reward and punishment system of the Soviet October Victory Collective Farm, they implemented a contract labor and output system, specifically stipulating the cooperative's reward and punishment system. After this, the planning of the entire cooperative's production and the leadership of the groups were strengthened. The labor enthusiasm, initiative, and creativity of the members were even higher. On the third day of the first lunar month this year, the groups automatically began to transport fertilizer. In the fertilizer transportation, everyone ran fast and carried full loads. Zhang Bianze's group transported fertilizer from the livestock pen to the river land. The original plan was twenty-five trips per workday, but all eight people exceeded the plan. Zhang Zhixin, who carried the most, carried thirty-seven loads. Zhang Yunyun said: "Not only are we running faster, but this year carrying three loads of fertilizer is more than four loads in previous years." Because everyone increased their sense of responsibility, this year's work was done quickly and well.

In the spring afforestation movement, Xigou Village learned from the Soviet Union's experience of planned division of forest areas to develop forestry. Before the spring afforestation, the forest area was delineated according to the afforestation situation in Xigou, and the afforestation technology was studied. One hundred and twenty acres of barren hills were sown by Qingming Festival, and seventeen acres of good land were selected to plant Northeast apple trees. One hundred and twenty-two Northeast apple trees were grafted with grafting shears sent by the Soviet Union, and one hundred and thirty-four Qingdao grape seedlings were layered. A total of 9,332 trees of various kinds were planted this year, with a survival rate of over 80%. The annual tree planting plan was completed in one season.

In addition to appropriately learning from the advanced experience of the Soviet Union in specific work according to local conditions, Li Shunda also chatted with the masses about many new things in the Soviet Union at any time in the people's school and at the dinner table. Under his encouragement, the masses' political enthusiasm was constantly full, and the spirit of internationalism was gradually enhanced. The masses in Xigou Village have established a deep friendship with the Soviet Union. When the sad news of Comrade Stalin's death reached Xigou Village, everyone shed tears of grief. After the village's memorial meeting, they truly turned grief into strength, and all five production groups in the cooperative launched a production competition. The production plan for forty days was completed in one month.

The Li Shunda Agricultural, Forestry, and Animal Husbandry Production Cooperative not only paid attention to learning from the advanced experience of the Soviet Union, but also was good at learning from the successful experience of labor models in various regions. When labor models from Rehe Province visited Xigou Village, they introduced to them the experience of classifying and grazing sheep. The cooperative immediately implemented classified grazing of sheep, dividing the sheep into groups according to black and white, size, and male and female. This avoided the hybridization of sheep and the phenomenon that small sheep could not keep up with the big sheep and were not full, ensuring the normal development and reproduction of sheep.

In the spring production movement, the Li Shunda Agricultural, Forestry, and Animal Husbandry Production Cooperative has built five new stables, seven sheep kilns, three sand-blocking and water-slowing dams, thirty-two water-retaining banks, more than fifty zhang of ground dikes, and repaired and added thirty-two pieces of agricultural equipment in agricultural infrastructure construction. In addition, 31,550 loads of fertilizer have been accumulated, and enough firewood has been prepared for eight months. The autumn fields have been harrowed twice. At present, the groups are continuing to carry out competitions and are fully turning to sowing work. All 264.6 mu of autumn fields in the cooperative will be sown before the Beginning of Summer. This year, the high-yield land has been expanded from ten mu last year to fifty mu. (Li Lin Chen Jie Zhen Zhong)

    积极学习苏联经验和各地农民的经验
    平顺西沟村今年的春耕生产比往年更好
    今年山西省平顺县西沟村的农民在劳动模范李顺达的领导下，积极响应毛主席学习苏联先进经验建设国家的号召，在春耕生产中表现了许多新的特点。
    李顺达农林畜牧生产合作社根据本社的实际情况，学习了苏联十月胜利集体农庄（去年李顺达去苏联参观时特别访问了这个农庄）的奖惩制度，加强了社员对社的责任心。一九五二年社里实行了“四定包工”制以后，社员生产的积极性虽然显著地提高了，但部分社员曾产生了争工和不讲究技术的偏向。不在大家包工范围内的生产发生了问题，常常没有人管，因而不能更好地保证增产。他们学习了苏联十月胜利集体农庄的奖惩制度以后，实行了包工包产制，具体规定了社的奖惩制度。这以后，全社生产的计划性和小组的领导都加强了。社员的劳动积极性、主动性和创造性更高了。今年旧历正月初三，各小组都自动地开始运肥。在运肥中，大家跑的快，担的满。张扁则小组从牲口圈往下河地担肥，原计划一工担二十五次，结果八个人都超过了计划。担得最多的张枝心担了三十七担。张云运说：“不光跑的快，今年担肥三担就有往年四担多。”由于人人增强了责任心，今年的活做的又快又好。
    在春季造林运动中，西沟村学习了苏联有计划地划分林区发展林业的经验。春季造林以前，根据西沟造林情况，划定了林区，研究了造林技术。清明节完成了荒山播种一百二十亩，并选择了好地植东北苹果树十七亩，用苏联送给的接树剪刀接东北苹果树一百二十二株，又压了青岛葡萄一百三十四株，今年共种各种树九千三百三十二株，成活率都在百分之八十以上。一年的植树计划一季就完成了。
    李顺达除在具体工作中因地制宜地适当学习了苏联的先进经验而外，还随时随地在民校和饭场上给群众漫谈苏联的许多新事情。在他的鼓舞之下，群众的政治热情经常饱满，国际主义的思想逐渐增强。西沟村群众对苏联已建立起一种深厚友情。斯大林同志逝世的悲痛消息传到西沟村时，大家都流下了沉痛的眼泪。在全村的追悼大会以后，他们真正做到了把悲痛化为力量，全社五个生产小组开展了生产竞赛。四十天的生产计划一个月就完成了。
    李顺达农林畜牧生产合作社不但注意学习苏联先进经验，而且善于学习各地劳动模范的成功经验。热河省劳动模范到西沟村参观时，曾介绍给他们羊群分类牧放的经验。该社立即实行了羊群分类放牧，把羊群按黑白、大小、公母分了群。这样，避免了羊的杂交和小羊因跟不上大羊而吃不饱的现象，保证了羊的正常发育和繁殖。
    在春季生产运动中，李顺达农林畜牧生产合作社，在农业基本建设上，已盖厩房五间、羊窑七孔，筑拦沙缓水坝三道，筑拦水岸三十二道，垒地堰五十余丈，修、添了农具三十二件。此外积肥三万一千五百五十担，烧柴已准备够八个月用。秋田已普遍耙耢两次。目前各小组正继续开展竞赛，全力转向播种工作。全社二百六十四亩六分秋田，立夏节前全部播种完毕。今年的丰产地已由去年的十亩扩大到五十亩。          （李琳　陈杰　振中）
