Since the promulgation and implementation of the Marriage Law, all parts of the country have achieved considerable success in marriage registration and mediation. According to incomplete statistics from 23 provinces (Songjiang, Rehe, Shaanxi, Gansu, Ningxia, Fujian, Shandong, Zhejiang, Henan, Hubei, Hunan, Jiangxi, Guangdong, Guangxi, Guizhou, Yunnan, Xikang, Hebei, Shanxi, Pingyuan, Chahar (reorganized), Suiyuan, Jiangsu, South Anhui, South Sichuan) and 11 cities (Shenyang, Lushun-Dalian, Anshan, Benxi, Nanjing, Wuhan, Guangzhou, Xi'an, Chongqing, Beijing, Tianjin): From the promulgation of the Marriage Law in May 1950 to the end of June 1952, a total of 536,954 couples registered for marriage, 332,384 divorces were registered, 23,567 widows remarried, and 32,925 marriage engagements (including child brides) were cancelled. Statistics from 36 counties in Shaanxi Province show that 3,367 couples registered for marriage in 1950, 11,127 in 1951, and 15,185 in the first half of 1952, an increase of more than three and a half times compared to 1950; 306 divorces were registered in 1950, 4,435 in 1951, and 5,987 in the first half of 1952, an increase of more than eighteen and a half times compared to 1950. In areas where registration work is done relatively well, the number of illegal marriages involving coercion, arranged marriages, early marriages, and sales gradually decreases. In Changwu County, Shaanxi Province, out of 555 marriages in 1950, only 64 were registered, accounting for about 11.5 percent. In 1951, 107 out of 576 marriages were registered, accounting for about 18.5 percent. In 1952, 242 out of 302 marriages were registered, accounting for about 80.2 percent.

In areas where the marriage registration system is relatively sound and registration staff are relatively responsible, the vast majority of registered marriages are free marriages based on mutual consent. According to a survey of 15 villages in Wuxiang, Yushe, and Zuoquan counties in Shanxi Province, all 96 registered couples were in free marriages; in Tianjin, free marriages accounted for about 98 percent of the 22,124 marriages registered from January 1951 to May 1952; in Beijing, out of 11,065 marriages registered from January to June 1952, 10,275 were free marriages, accounting for about 93 percent of the total.

In the process of marriage registration, due to the conscientiousness and responsibility of cadres, many feudal marriages have been prevented, and the struggle of many men and women to win freedom of marriage has been supported. For example, in Hongshan County, Hubei Province, through marriage registration work, more than 50 early marriages, 15 forced marriages, and 5 bigamous marriages were prevented in the first nine months of 1951 alone. Some women who sought freedom of marriage succumbed to feudal families due to poor awareness and lack of courage; however, when they went to the People's Government for registration, they were discovered by the registration staff, who supported them in further struggles and achieved victory. For example, Du Guangqun (female) of Fuxing Township, Peng County, Sichuan Province, was betrothed to Yuan Faqing by her parents in an arranged marriage. She was unwilling, but her father forced her to go to the township People's Government for registration with Yuan Faqing. When she arrived at the township People's Government, the civil affairs cadre Wang Shouming noticed that she looked uneasy and asked her three times if she was willing. She slowly said "yes," with tears in her eyes. Wang temporarily did not register her, asked both parties to go back and think about it again, and immediately went down to investigate. Later, after clarifying the details, he convened a mass meeting to conduct propaganda and education on the Marriage Law to enlighten both parties. Du Guangqun boldly stated that she did not agree to this marriage at all. Yuan Faqing also recognized the truth that "there is no benefit in forcing things." He said, "Forcing a hen won't make it lay eggs. Any marriage that is not willingly entered into by both parties will not last long or be happy!" So the engagement was dissolved on the spot, and both parents realized their mistakes and said that they would never arrange their children's marriages again.

In terms of divorce registration, many registration authorities have given reasonable and appropriate mediation based on policies and specific circumstances: those who should divorce were divorced, and those who could reconcile were reconciled, thereby improving the marital and family relations of the people. For example, the Jiamusi Civil Affairs Bureau of Songjiang Province handled 343 marriage disputes from 1951 to June 1952, of which 191 were divorced by agreement, 82 were divorced through mediation, and 70 were reconciled through mediation; in the winter of 1951, seven townships including Taoyuan Township in Yongchun County, Fujian Province, mediated 80 marriage disputes in more than a month and improved many old family relationships.

Marriage registration and mediation work has been successful in the past two years, but there are still many problems in most areas that need to be improved. These problems are mainly manifested in the following aspects:

Some district and township cadres treat this work with a serious bureaucratic attitude, procrastinate, fail to conduct serious investigations and research, and fail to handle problems in a timely manner, causing undue losses to the parties involved, and even leading to loss of life. For example, a mediation assistant in a district in Rudong County, Jiangsu Province, said: "Women want to divorce at the drop of a hat, let her walk a few more times!" The masses reflected: "The democratic government doesn't charge for divorce, but it takes two or three years to process!" Li Yueying, a widow in the third district of Hejin County, Shanxi Province, fell in love with Yuan Chongfa in July 1951 and wanted to remarry, but was blocked by her in-laws in many ways, who falsely accused them of being in a commercial marriage. On September 3rd, she went to the district to apply for a marriage certificate, but the district secretary Xue Jianli still said that they were in a commercial marriage and forced Yueying to "confess." Yueying had nothing to confess, so Xue said that he would "investigate"; but after running four more times, Xue neither investigated nor approved, and finally threatened her, saying: "Being anxious doesn't count. Even if you give your life to the district, it won't help." Yueying had no choice but to go back and commit suicide by taking poison the next day.

Some marriage registration staff use various methods to restrict the freedom of marriage for men and women. For example, Hengshan District, Wuning County, Jiangxi Province, after the promulgation of the Marriage Law, privately formulated "Supplementary Measures to the Marriage Law" in violation of the Marriage Law, which stipulated that "after a divorce, the woman shall not remarry before the man remarries."

Some district and township cadres arbitrarily stipulate various complicated procedures, require "letters of introduction," "divorce conditions," and illegally collect registration fees, making marriage registration a "checkpoint" restricting the freedom of marriage for the masses. For example, in Pantu Township, Tongan County, Fujian Province, marriage registration must be introduced by the township People's Government to the district, photographs must be taken, physical examinations must be done, application forms must be written, and marriage certificates must be obtained. This makes it necessary for the masses, especially those in remote mountainous areas, to travel dozens or hundreds of miles to the district for registration, spending a lot of time. Therefore, the masses reflect: "Now marriage is not difficult, but the procedures are difficult, five procedures and three checkpoints." Fan Xishan and Hu Dewen in Pixian County, Sichuan Province, voluntarily became husband and wife and applied to the district People's Government for registration on June 1, 1952. The registration staff insisted on a "letter of introduction" from the township or police station before they would process it, which made them run back and forth between the district, township, police station, and county to find the "letter of introduction," spending more than ten days, delaying production, but with no results. Sanhe District, Santai County, Sichuan Province, once stipulated that the fee for a marriage certificate was 15,000 yuan, and the fee for a divorce certificate was 20,000 yuan; Xiangyang County, Hubei Province, charged more than 40,000 yuan for a divorce certificate, which caused great dissatisfaction among the masses. (This has been corrected)

Some registration staff do not conduct propaganda and education for the parties involved, adopting an attitude of "register whoever comes, and forget about whoever doesn't," and act hastily, resulting in the registration of arranged marriages, commercial marriages, and other marriages that should not be approved. In Benxi City, out of 1,620 couples who registered for marriage with the government after the promulgation of the Marriage Law, 1,160 were inspected, of which 87 were coerced or forced, and 29 were commercial marriages. In Ninggang Township, Yangxian County, Shaanxi Province, 16 out of 26 registered marriages were arranged or commercial marriages.

Some adopt a peacemaker attitude of "dissolving lawsuits and reconciling marriages" or an irresponsible attitude of "half an eye open, half an eye closed" and "concealing from above but not from below" during mediation, and handle problems without principle. For example, Pan Xianlai, a woman in the seventh district of Laibin County, Guangxi Province, was sold to Wei Rigeng as a child bride at the age of seven. She has been abused by her mother-in-law and husband and has repeatedly requested a divorce, but has been blocked by the village farmers' association and the township People's Government; the township head He Xiuzhong said to her: "You are the same age, there are no conditions for divorce, you cannot divorce. Now there is only freedom of marriage, not freedom of divorce!" As a result, she felt that there was no way out, so she committed suicide by jumping into the river collectively with her close friends Huang Xianqiu and He Xianji.

In addition, some registration staff do not do enough to protect the interests of women and children when dealing with divorce property and child support issues. They believe that "divorce is already cheap for the woman, why should she want property!" Of the twenty-five divorced women in Changan Township, Feixi County, Anhui Province, twenty did not get land, and Li Guiying was sold to someone else for 200,000 yuan because she had no means of living after the divorce. A woman in Huanggang District, Funan County, asked to take property with her when she divorced, but the district cadre said: "Forget it! Getting divorced is a blessing!" Some counties and districts regard marriage registration as a purely technical job and do not set up special personnel to handle it. Xinxiang District in Guangzhou once assigned marriage registration work to the cashier. A district in Ningqiang County, Shaanxi Province, had the cook do it, and sometimes even let the parties fill out and issue the certificates themselves.

Because of these serious problems in marriage registration work, marriage registration, a statutory procedure to protect people's freedom of marriage, has become a "difficult hurdle" hindering the freedom of marriage for men and women in some areas. Wherever this phenomenon exists, the marriage registration system is not supported by the masses, but is feared and hated by the masses, thereby affecting the implementation of the Marriage Law. Therefore, in the long-term implementation of the Marriage Law after the end of this Marriage Law Publicity Month, we must do a good job of marriage registration. First of all, we must improve the marriage registration authorities. In marriage registration authorities where there are no cadres specifically in charge of marriage registration, they should be quickly equipped; those who were originally there but doing other work should be immediately transferred back to their original positions. The county (city) People's Government should seriously rectify the marriage registration authorities and strengthen leadership over this work.

Secondly, while rectifying and strengthening the marriage registration authorities, training marriage registration staff is also very important. The supplementary instructions of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China on the work of the Marriage Law Publicity Month have clearly pointed out: "To ensure that the district and township People's Governments can correctly handle marriage registration, the superior party committees and People's Governments must immediately transfer and train a group of cadres with correct viewpoints to take on this task." "Make them fully understand the Marriage Law and be able to faithfully and correctly implement it. Personnel who still cannot correctly perform their duties after education should be replaced." Therefore, all localities should immediately start training cadres on a special district or county basis. Cadres performing marriage registration must be constantly subjected to ideological education, their feudal thoughts must be eliminated, and the occurrence of illegal and undisciplined phenomena must be prevented.

In the specific work of marriage registration, several necessary systems should be established, such as necessary investigations, periodic work inspections and summaries, to overcome the phenomenon of laissez-faire.

    切实做好婚姻登记工作
    自婚姻法颁布施行以来，全国各地在进行婚姻登记和调解工作中已获得了不少成绩。据松江、热河、陕西、甘肃、宁夏、福建、山东、浙江、河南、湖北、湖南、江西、广东、广西、贵州、云南、西康、河北、山西、平原、察哈尔（已改建制）、绥远、江苏、皖南、川南等二十三省二行署及沈阳、旅大、鞍山、本溪、南京、武汉、广州、西安、重庆、北京、天津等十一市的不完全统计：自一九五○年五月婚姻法颁布起至一九五二年六月底止，共办理结婚登记五三六、九五四对，离婚登记三三二、三八四件，寡妇改嫁的二三、五六七人，取消婚约
    （包括童养媳）三二、九二五人。陕西省三十六个县的统计，一九五○年结婚登记的三、三六七对，一九五一年一一、一二七对，一九五二年上半年即达一五、一八五对，较一九五○年增加三倍半以上；一九五○年离婚登记的三○六对，一九五一年四、四三五对，一九五二年上半年即达五、九八七对，较一九五○年增加十八倍半以上。凡是登记工作做的比较好的地区，强迫包办、早婚、买卖等非法婚姻的数字就逐渐减少。陕西长武县一九五○年总共结婚五五五件中，经过登记的只有六四件，约占百分之十一点五。一九五一年结婚的五七六件中，经过登记的一○七件；约占百分之十八点五；一九五二年结婚三○二件中，经过登记的就有二四二件，约占百分之八十点二。
    在婚姻登记制度比较健全、登记工作人员比较负责的地区，凡是经过登记结婚的，绝大部分都是自主自愿的自由婚姻。据山西省武乡、榆社、左权三县十五个村的调查，在登记结婚的九十六对中，全部是自由婚姻；天津市一九五一年一月至一九五二年五月登记结婚的二二、一二四对中，自由婚姻约占百分之九十八；北京市一九五二年一至六月结婚登记的共有一一、○六五对，其中自由婚姻一○、二七五对，约占总数的百分之九十三。
    在婚姻登记过程中，由于干部的认真负责，曾制止了不少封建婚姻，支持了不少男女争取婚姻自由的斗争。如湖北省洪山县通过婚姻登记工作，仅一九五一年一月至九月即制止了早婚五十多对、强迫婚姻十五对、重婚五对。有些要求婚姻自由的妇女，由于觉悟较差，勇气不足，对封建家庭屈服了；但到人民政府登记的时候，为登记人员所发觉，就支持她们进一步斗争，取得胜利。如四川彭县复兴乡杜光群（女）被爹娘包办和袁发清订了婚，她不愿意，但她爹硬逼她和袁发清去乡人民政府登记。到了乡人民政府，民政干事王守明见她神色有些不自在，连问她三声是否自愿，才慢吞吞地说了一声“同意”，眼里还闪着泪水，王就暂不予以登记，叫双方回去再考虑一下，并立即下去调查。后来弄清了底细，召开群众大会进行婚姻法的宣传教育，启发双方觉悟；杜光群大胆地说出她根本不同意这婚事，袁发清也认清了“逼着干没好处”的道理，说：“按倒鸡婆不抱蛋，任何一方不甘愿的婚姻都不会长久，不会幸福！”于是当场解除了婚约，两家父母也都认识到自己的错误，表示以后决不再包办儿女的婚姻了。
    离婚登记方面很多登记机关都曾根据政策及具体情况给予合情合理的调处：该离的离了，可以不离的和好了，因而改善了人民群众的婚姻关系和家庭关系。如松江省佳木斯民政局自一九五一年至一九五二年六月份，处理了婚姻纠纷三四三件，其中协议离婚的一九一件，调解离婚的八十二件，调解和好的七十件；福建省永春县桃源等七个乡在一九五一年冬天，一个多月的时间就调解了八十件婚姻纠纷案，并改善了不少旧的家庭关系。
    两年多来婚姻登记和调解工作是有成绩的，但在大部地区对婚姻登记和调解工作还存在着不少问题，亟须改进。这些问题主要表现在以下几方面：
    有的区、乡干部以严重的官僚主义态度对待这一工作，推诿拖延，不认真调查研究，不及时处理问题，使当事人受到不应有的损失，甚至酿成人命。如江苏如东县某区调解助理员说：“妇女动不动就想离婚，让她多走几趟！”群众反映说：“民主政府离婚不要钱，一拖就是二、三年。”山西河津县三区寡妇李月英一九五一年七月爱上了袁充发，要改嫁，被公婆多方阻挡，并诬他俩是买卖婚姻。九月三日到区请领结婚证，区秘书薛建立就照样说他俩是买卖婚姻，硬逼月英“坦白”，月英没啥坦白的，薛就说要“调查”；但以后连跑了四次，薛既不调查，也不批准，最后还吓唬她说：“着急不算话，你就是把命给了区上也不顶事。”月英无奈，回去第二天就服毒自杀了。
    有些婚姻登记工作人员，用种种办法限制男女婚姻的自由。如江西省武宁县横山区，在婚姻法颁布后，私自制定了违背婚姻法的“婚姻法补充办法”，其中规定“离婚后，男方在未娶之前女方不得再嫁。”
    有的区、乡干部擅自规定种种繁复手续，要“介绍信”，要“离婚条件”以及乱收登记费等，使婚姻登记成为一道限制群众婚姻自由的“关口”。如福建同安县潘涂乡办理婚姻登记须经乡人民政府介绍到区、照相片、检查体格、写申请书、领结婚证等手续，使群众特别是偏僻山区的群众，到区登记，往往要跑几十里或百数十里，花费很多时间。因此群众反映：“现在结婚不难手续难，五道手续三道关。”四川郫县范锡山与胡德文自愿结为夫妇，一九五二年六月一日同往区人民政府申请登记，办理登记的人员一定要乡或派出所的“介绍信”才行，使他俩为了找“介绍信”，在区、乡、派出所及县之间往返奔跑，花了十多天时间，耽误了生产，却毫无结果。四川三台县三合区曾规定结婚证收费一万五千元，离婚证收费两万元；湖北襄阳县收离婚证费竟达四万余元，引起群众很大不满。（已纠正）
    有的登记人员不对当事人进行宣传教育，抱“来者就登，不来就算”的态度，草率从事，结果使包办、买卖婚姻及其他不应准予登记的婚姻都给登记了。本溪市自婚姻法公布后到政府登记结婚的共有一、六二○对，检查了一、一六○对，其中有包办强迫的八十七对，买卖婚姻二十九对。陕西洋县宁岗乡登记结婚的二十六对中，有十六对是包办买卖婚姻。
    有的在进行调解时，采“遇官司说散，遇婚姻说和”的和事佬态度或“半个眼睁，半个眼闭”、“瞒上不瞒下”等不负责任的态度，无原则地处理问题。如广西来宾县七区妇女潘现来，七岁时被卖给韦日耕做童养媳，一贯受婆母、丈夫虐待，多次要求离婚，均被村农会及乡人民政府所阻；乡长何秀忠对她说：“你们年龄相同，没有离婚条件，不能离婚。现在只有结婚自由，没有离婚自由！”结果，使她感到无路可走，就和平日密友妇女黄现求、何现纪集体投河自杀了。
    此外，有的登记人员处理离婚带产及子女抚养等问题时，在照顾妇女和子女利益方面做的不够。他们认为“离婚就算便宜女方了，还要什么财产！”安徽肥西县长安乡二十五个离婚妇女，有二十个未得土地，其中李桂英因离婚后生活无着，又被以二十万元卖给人家了。阜南县黄岗区有一妇女离婚时要求带产，区干部说：“算了吧！离掉婚就算万幸了！”还有的县、区把婚姻登记视为单纯的技术工作，不设专人办理。广州市新?区曾把婚姻登记工作交给出纳员兼办。陕西宁强县某区让炊事员办，有时甚至让当事人自己填发。
    由于在婚姻登记工作中还存在以上这些严重问题，就使婚姻登记这个保障人民婚姻自由的法定手续，在某些地区变成了阻碍男女婚姻自由的“难关”。凡是存在着这种现象的地方，婚姻登记制度就不为群众所拥护，反而为群众所惧怕和讨厌，从而影响了婚姻法的贯彻。因此，在这次贯彻婚姻法运动月结束后的长期贯彻婚姻法工作中，一定要把婚姻登记工作做好。首先必须健全婚姻登记机关。在婚姻登记机关中，原来没有专管婚姻登记的干部的，应迅速配备起来；原来已经有而做了其他工作的，应立即调回原工作岗位。县（市）人民政府应认真整顿婚姻登记机关，并加强对这一工作的领导。
    其次，在整顿与加强婚姻登记机关的同时，训练婚姻登记工作人员也是非常重要的。中共中央关于贯彻婚姻法运动月工作的补充指示中已经明白指出：“保证区乡人民政府能够正确地办理婚姻登记，上级党委和人民政府必须立即抽调和训练一批观点正确的干部来担任。”“使其完全了解婚姻法并能忠实而正确地加以执行。对于那些经过教育以后仍然不能正确地执行任务的人员，应加以撤换。”因此各地应以专署或县为单位，立即着手训练干部。对于执行婚姻登记的干部，必须经常地进行思想教育，肃清其封建思想，制止违法乱纪的现象发生。
    在具体进行婚姻登记的工作中，应该建立若干必要的制度，如必要的调查，定期的工作检查总结等克服放任自流的现象。
