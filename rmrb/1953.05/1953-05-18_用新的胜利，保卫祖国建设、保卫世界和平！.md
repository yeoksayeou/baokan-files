Use New Victories to Defend National Construction and World Peace!
Speech by Yuan Shengping, Head of the Chinese People's Volunteer Army's "May Day" Delegation to Return Home for Observance

Dear compatriots across the country, comrades!

We are greatly honored to return to the motherland on behalf of all the comrades of the Chinese People's Volunteer Army to participate in the "May Day" celebrations in the capital. The celebration parade of 500,000 people from all walks of life in the capital was a great review of the powerful strength of our motherland. We personally witnessed the prosperous and strong new face of our great motherland in the solemn and majestic Tiananmen Square, and saw the unparalleled enthusiasm of the working class and working people of the motherland in participating in national economic construction, and the unparalleled firm confidence and strength of the people of the motherland in defending peace. We are extremely happy and excited! For more than two years, our volunteer army has been fighting hard day and night on the Korean front, precisely to defend our great and lovely motherland, and to defend the cause of peace for all progressive mankind! It is precisely because of the full support of the people of the great motherland that our volunteer army has been able to achieve brilliant victories in the War to Resist U.S. Aggression and Aid Korea, and has won extremely high honors. On behalf of all the comrades of the Volunteer Army, we pay our respects to our beloved great leader Chairman Mao! We pay our respects to all the comrades of the Chinese People's Liberation Army's land, sea, and air forces who defend the national defense and consolidate domestic social security! We pay our respects to the fathers, brothers, and sisters from all walks of life in the motherland who fully support us!

Our Volunteer Army's "May Day" delegation to return home for observation will also report to the people of the motherland on the situation of the struggle on the Korean front during this visit to the capital for observation and visits. More than six months have passed since the Volunteer Army's National Day delegation to return home for observation returned to the front from the motherland last October until our return to the motherland this time. In the past six months, the struggle on the Korean front has undergone new developments, and our volunteer army has achieved new and major victories on the Korean battlefield!

In the past six months, our volunteer army has continued to carry out active defensive operations victoriously on the battle lines near the 38th parallel in Korea, eliminating a large number of enemy troops. From last October to the end of April this year, our volunteer army and the Korean People's Army together eliminated more than 161,000 invading troops headed by U.S. imperialism and the Lee Seung-man puppet army, of which more than 62,000 were U.S. troops. Our army shot down and damaged more than 3,200 enemy aircraft and destroyed and damaged more than 510 enemy tanks. The new victory of our army has severely hit the arrogant attempt of U.S. imperialism to continue and expand its aggressive war, and has further inspired the fighting will and determination of all peace-loving people in the world!

As everyone remembers, a week after the U.S. aggressors announced the indefinite suspension of the Korean armistice negotiations last year, the U.S. invading forces launched the largest offensive since the autumn of 1951 in the Shangganling area north of Kimhwa. This offensive by the enemy was personally planned and commanded by Van Fleet, the then head of the U.S. military invading Korea. In order to capture two mountain positions with a combined area of less than four square kilometers, Van Fleet used more than 50,000 troops, 17 field artillery battalions, and five tank companies, and dispatched an average of more than 70 aircraft sorties per day to cooperate in the battle. It is unprecedented on the Korean battlefield and rare in world military history to put such a huge force and firepower into such a small area. The purpose of the U.S. aggressors in launching this offensive was to dream of achieving a little victory, salvaging their reputation for a disastrous defeat on the Korean battlefield, alleviating the various contradictions they faced, and attempting to use the United Nations General Assembly to extort more cannon fodder from their puppet countries to expand the aggressive war. Our army guarding the Shangganling positions carried forward the spirit of unparalleled heroic and tenacious fighting, relied on solid tunnel fortifications, and used flexible tactics. With the close cooperation of powerful artillery and tank units, after 46 days of hard fighting, they completely smashed the enemy's offensive and eliminated more than 25,000 enemy troops. The Shangganling campaign was a great victory. The participating troops on the Shangganling front created brilliant heroic achievements in world war history. It made a great contribution to the cause of the people of the world against U.S. aggression and defending world peace. The U.S. aggressors not only suffered another disastrous defeat militarily, but also suffered a serious blow politically.

After the end of the glorious Shangganling campaign, our volunteer army victoriously carried out winter operations in the icy and snowy areas of the Korean front. During the days of the third winter operation in the Korean War, our army launched a more active and extensive battle than in the winter of 1951. In this winter, our army carried out more than 200 victorious raid battles. The number of times our army took the initiative to attack and wipe out the enemy increased nearly three times compared with the previous winter. From last December to the end of February this year, the number of enemy troops eliminated by the Chinese and Korean People's Armies increased by nearly 10,000 compared with the previous winter, and the number of enemy aircraft shot down and damaged increased by more than 290. The invading forces and the Lee puppet army headed by U.S. imperialism were less capable of fighting and had lower morale this winter. The number of times they dared to invade our army's positions was more than half less than in the previous winter, and each invasion by the enemy suffered heavy casualties, some of which were completely wiped out by our army's ambush troops. The U.S. invading forces suffered greater losses in this winter's operations than in the previous winter. The U.S. aggressors attempted to escape their casualties by using the vicious policy of "Asians fighting Asians." They worked hard to expand the Lee puppet army to be their scapegoats. However, in this winter's operations, the casualties of the U.S. military not only did not decrease, but increased by more than 1,600 compared with the previous winter. In the winter before last, the Lee puppet army had ten divisions and guarded half of the battle line, and the U.S. military suffered 12,600 casualties in the battle; in the winter last year, although the U.S. aggressors pieced together four more Lee puppet army divisions to the front, a total of fourteen divisions of the Lee puppet army guarded two-thirds of the battle line, the casualties of the U.S. military increased to 14,200. The comparison of these two winter operations shows that the change in the strength of the enemy and us is developing in a direction favorable to our army. Our army's combat strength has become stronger and stronger, and the blows to the enemy have become heavier and heavier.

Since March this year, our army has launched a more active spring operation on the front than the winter operation. In March and April alone, our army fought more than 400 battles with the enemy, eliminating more than 30,000 enemy troops.

Our army's victory in the past six months has been huge. This victory was not easily obtained. It is inseparable from our efforts for more than two years.

Everyone knows that the U.S. invading army is a brutal army armed to the teeth. It is an arrogant invading army that relies on its advantages in equipment and technology. This invading army must be defeated and can certainly be defeated. Our Chinese People's Volunteer Army has demonstrated its invincible power and defeated it with inferior equipment. In the offensive mobile warfare, our volunteer army boldly and bravely surrounded, detoured, interspersed, divided, advanced by leaps and bounds, and transferred initiative, victoriously carried out five battles, and drove the U.S. invading army back to the vicinity of the 38th parallel, the starting point of its aggression. In the active defensive operations, our volunteer army built solid fortifications near the 38th parallel, established indestructible and indestructible steel positions, and used flexible combat methods such as blocking, counterattacking, ambushing, raiding, and sniping to continue to consume and annihilate a large number of enemy troops. After nearly a year of stable front-line positional defensive operations, our army has continuously launched tactical offensive operations since September last year. No matter how solid the enemy's positions are built and even with tunnel fortifications as support, our army still occupied many enemy positions and wiped out the enemies who guarded the positions in whole platoons and companies. Our volunteer army has been trained into a powerful and invincible force that can attack and defend, is wise and brave, and has rich combat experience. We are moving from victory to greater victory. Conversely, the U.S. invading army is getting worse and worse, continuing to go "downhill," and moving from failure to greater failure.

Our Volunteer Army is a unit composed of outstanding children of the great Chinese people. We are full of love for peace, love for the motherland, and hatred for the enemy. We marched onto the Korean battlefield with high spirits and fought side by side with the Korean People's Army to attack the U.S. aggressors. We understand that the war we are waging is a just, anti-aggression war. Therefore, we can move forward bravely and without retreat in the offensive; we can be tenacious, calm, and stubbornly defend in the defense; we will never bow our heads in the face of difficulties, we can endure hardships, overcome all difficulties, and give full play to wisdom and creation, and strive to complete tasks and win victory. Our volunteer army has fully demonstrated the heroic spirit of overwhelming the enemy and defeating the enemy. Countless heroic figures and heroic deeds have emerged. In the glorious Shangganling campaign, the ideological consciousness of the comrades of our volunteer army's participating units reached a new peak, and they generally showed special bravery and tenacity. There were 31 known heroes in a certain unit, like Huang Jiguang, Sun Zhanyuan, and Qiu Shaoyun, who sacrificed themselves to eliminate the enemy and exchanged for the entire victory in times of emergency. Many outstanding figures with both wisdom and courage like Yi Caixue also emerged. All the participating soldiers could actively fight and firmly believe in victory in any serious situation. For the sake of victory, many slightly wounded soldiers insisted on fighting and refused to leave the front line; seriously wounded soldiers climbed down the front line themselves and refused to let others carry them in order to let more people continue fighting. Commanders and fighters of the artillery units also displayed great bravery and persisted in fighting under the enemy's artillery and aircraft bombardment, actively and proactively supporting the infantry and fiercely bombarding the enemy. The transportation units also showed the greatest bravery and selfless spirit. Many truck drivers did not sleep for several consecutive days and nights. When they were hungry, they took out steamed buns and ate them while driving. They loaded and unloaded the vehicles themselves and drove back and forth on the enemy's aircraft and artillery blockade line, ensuring the supply of ammunition and food to the front line. The infantry transport units also braved the enemy's artillery fire and carried loads beyond the normal human physical strength. Some even carried 200 pounds at a time, and some bravely joined the battle when the battle required it. In the face of such a people's army with a high degree of ideological awareness, there is no enemy that cannot be defeated.

The great historical victory of the Chinese People's Volunteer Army on the Korean battlefield shattered the U.S. imperialist sinister plot to occupy the entire Korea and attack our country, defended the independence of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea, defended the security of the motherland, and made a huge contribution to the cause of defending peace in the world. The people of the motherland, the Korean people, and the peace-loving people all over the world have given us extremely high honors, calling us the most beloved people and the heroic troops defending peace. However, this honor should belong to the great motherland and the people of the motherland who fully support us.

Under the education of Chairman Mao, the people of our great motherland have carried forward the high spirit of patriotism and internationalism, launched a vigorous movement to resist U.S. aggression and aid Korea in the country, and put forward the slogan that the volunteer army needs whatever we can give, if they need people we will give people, if they need money we will give money, and fully support us. With the full support of the people of the motherland, we have had a sufficient supply of ammunition and materials. We eat enough, eat well, and have surplus grain; we dress warmly, dress well, and dress in a timely manner. The cotton clothes for last winter were transported to the front line in October; this year's summer clothes were delivered to us in mid-March. With the support of the people of the motherland, the equipment of our volunteer army has been improved. We already have a powerful artillery unit and young tank unit and air force unit. The people of the motherland also brought us a large amount of spiritual food, constantly giving us material comfort and spiritual encouragement. Last October, they sent the second delegation to Korea to comfort us on the front line with a large number of consolation goods; this year, they sent a cultural troupe to the front line to perform consolation performances. All our comrades deeply thank Chairman Mao for his meticulous care for us, and thank the people of the motherland for their full support. The victory of the Volunteer Army is the result of the full support of the people of the motherland. Glory belongs to the people of our great motherland.

Glory should also belong to the heroic Korean people and their army. In the nearly three years of the anti-aggression war, the Korean People's Army has become stronger and stronger, and has also been trained into a steel-like powerful armed force. The heroic Korean People's Army is not only the liberator and defender of the Korean people, but also the loyal defender of peace in Asia and the world. In more than two years of fighting side by side with the Korean People's Army, our Volunteer Army has supported each other, helped each other, learned from each other, and jointly achieved great victories. We are proud to have such close comrades-in-arms. Under the leadership of Premier Kim Il-sung, the Korean Workers' Party, and the government, the heroic Korean people have persisted in the great struggle against the U.S. aggressors and for the independence and freedom of their motherland. The Korean people have suffered deeply from the serious disasters caused by the U.S. aggressors, but they are not discouraged or saddened. Instead, they have carried forward the traditional spirit of courage, diligence, and hard work of the Korean nation, full of confidence in victory, and worked hard to produce and support the front line. For more than two years, we have shared weal and woe with the Korean people and established a deep brotherly friendship. The Korean people also love and support our army even more. In the Shangganling campaign, 8,429 Korean men and women residents, labor party members, and local government cadres enthusiastically participated in supporting our army's work. They carefully and thoughtfully carried the wounded under artillery fire, set up tea stations on the way to the front line to entertain our army's passing personnel, and organized song and dance troupes to conduct consolation performances in the troops. Among these Korean people who supported our army, more than 150 model figures emerged, such as the great internationalist martyr Park Jae-geun who sacrificed himself to protect our army's wounded soldiers, Park Byung-ok, a woman who donated blood to our army's wounded soldiers, and Ham Jae-bok, a woman who washed more than 1,000 bloody clothes for our army's wounded soldiers. With the support and support of the Korean people, we stood on the ground where we will surely win and never be defeated.

Glory should also belong to the peace and democratic camp headed by the Soviet Union and the peace-loving people all over the world. Their support for us and their struggle against aggression and in defense of peace have given us great encouragement. Our struggle is part of the struggle of the people all over the world to defend peace. Our victory is the victory of the peace-loving people all over the world. Our glory is also the glory of the peace-loving people all over the world. Now, the Korean armistice negotiations, which had been interrupted for half a year, have resumed. This is the result of our consistent efforts to achieve an armistice in Korea for the sake of peace in the Far East and the world. In order to eliminate the only obstacle to the Korean armistice negotiations, which is the disagreement on the issue of the repatriation of all prisoners of war, we have made concessions in the steps and methods of repatriating all prisoners of war. However, we know that the reasonable resolution of the prisoner of war repatriation issue cannot be achieved solely through the efforts of one side. Therefore, all commanders and fighters of our Volunteer Army must maintain a high degree of vigilance against the enemy, and must strive for a fair and reasonable resolution of the Korean issue with our unremitting struggle.

Dear compatriots, comrades! When we returned to the capital of the motherland for a visit, the Seventh National Congress of Trade Unions of our country was being held in the capital. The national working class will play a greater leading role, labor enthusiasm, and creative spirit in national construction, and unite the people of the country to ensure the completion and overfulfillment of the national construction plan, realize the industrialization of the country, and guide the motherland to a socialist future. We congratulate the successful conclusion of the National Congress of Trade Unions and wish the victorious completion of our country's 1953 economic construction plan. We must continue to work hard to defend the large-scale economic construction of the motherland and strive for the complete victory of the War to Resist U.S. Aggression and Aid Korea! Dear compatriots, comrades, as long as we are fighting, you can build with peace of mind! (Xinhua News Agency)

    用新的胜利，保卫祖国建设、保卫世界和平！
    中国人民志愿军“五一”节归国观礼代表团团长  袁升平亲爱的全国同胞们，全体同志们！
    我们代表中国人民志愿军全体同志回到祖国来参加首都“五一”节观礼，感到非常光荣。首都各界五十万人举行的庆祝游行大会是我们祖国强大力量的一次大检阅。我们在庄严雄伟的天安门广场上，亲眼看到了伟大祖国繁荣富强的新面貌，看到了祖国工人阶级和劳动人民参加国家经济建设的无比高涨的劳动热情，看到了祖国人民保卫和平的无比坚强的信心和力量，我们是万分的快乐和兴奋！两年多来，我们志愿军在朝鲜前线日日夜夜，艰苦战斗，正是为着保卫我们这个伟大可爱的祖国，为着保卫全体进步人类的和平事业！我们志愿军也正因为有了伟大祖国人民的全力支援，才能够在抗美援朝战争中取得辉煌的胜利，得到了极其崇高的荣誉。我们谨代表志愿军全体同志，向我们敬爱的伟大领袖毛主席致敬！向保卫祖国国防，巩固国内社会治安的中国人民解放军陆、海、空军全体同志们致敬！向全力支援我们的祖国各界父老、兄弟、姊妹们致敬！
    我们志愿军“五一”节归国观礼代表团这次回到首都来观礼和访问，同时要向祖国人民报告朝鲜前线的斗争情况。自从去年十月间志愿军国庆节归国观礼代表团从祖国回到前线以后，到我们这次回到祖国来，又过了六个多月。在这半年多时间里，朝鲜前线的斗争又有了新的发展，我们志愿军又在朝鲜战场上取得了新的重大的胜利！
    半年来，我们志愿军在朝鲜三八线附近的战线上继续胜利地进行了积极的防御作战，消灭了大量的敌军。从去年十月到今年四月底为止，我们志愿军和朝鲜人民军在一起，又消灭了以美帝国主义为首的侵略军及李承晚伪军一共十六万一千多人以上，其中美军占六万二千多人，我军又打落打伤敌军飞机三千二百多架，打毁打伤敌军坦克五百一十多辆。我军的新胜利，沉重地打击了美帝国主义继续和扩大侵略战争的狂妄企图，进一步鼓舞了全世界一切爱好和平人民的斗争意志和决心！
    大家记得，当去年美国侵略者宣布朝鲜停战谈判无限期中断以后一个星期，美国侵略军在金化以北上甘岭地区发动了一九五一年秋季以来最大的一次攻势。敌人的这次进攻是由当时的侵朝美军头子范佛里特亲自部署和指挥的。范佛里特为了攻占两个合起来面积不到四平方公里的山头阵地，使用了五万人以上的兵力，十七个野战炮兵营，五个坦克连，并且平均每天出动飞机七十多架次来配合作战。在这样一块狭小地区投进这样巨大的兵力和火力，这在朝鲜战场是空前的，在世界军事历史上也是少见的。美国侵略者发动这次进攻的目的，是梦想取得一点胜利，挽回它在朝鲜战场上惨败的声誉，缓和它所面临的各种矛盾，并企图利用联合国大会向它的仆从国家勒索更多的炮灰来扩大侵略战争。守卫上甘岭阵地的我军发扬了无比英勇顽强的战斗精神，依靠着坚固的坑道工事，运用了灵活的战术，在强大炮兵部队和坦克部队的紧密配合下，经过四十六天的苦战，彻底粉碎了敌人的进攻，消灭了敌军两万五千多名。上甘岭战役是一次伟大的胜利，上甘岭前线的参战部队创造了世界战史上辉煌的英雄业绩，它对于全世界人民反对美国侵略保卫世界和平的事业作了一个巨大的贡献。而美国侵略者不仅在军事上遭到了又一次的惨败，而且在政治上也遭受了一次严重的打击。
    在光辉的上甘岭战役结束以后，我们志愿军又在朝鲜前线的冰天雪地中胜利地进行了冬季作战。在朝鲜战争的第三个冬季作战的日子里，我军展开了比一九五一年冬季更积极、更广泛的战斗。在这一个冬季，我军共进行了二百多次胜利的袭击战。我军主动出击歼敌的次数比上一个冬季增加了将近三倍。从去年十二月到今年二月底为止，中朝人民军队消灭敌军的数字比上一个冬季增加了将近一万名，打落打伤敌军飞机的数字增加了二百九十多架。以美帝国主义为首的侵略军及李伪军在这个冬季中，战斗能力更差，士气更低，敢于向我军阵地窜犯的次数比上一年的冬季减少了一半还要多，而敌军的每次窜犯都遭到了重大的杀伤，有的被我军伏击部队全部消灭。美国侵略军在这个冬季作战中，遭到了比上一个冬季更大的损失。美国侵略者企图用“亚洲人打亚洲人”的恶毒政策来逃避自己的伤亡，他们努力扩充李伪军来当他们的替死鬼。可是，这个冬季作战中，美军的伤亡不但没有减少，而且比上一个冬季增加了一千六百多人。前年冬季李伪军有十个师，守了二分之一的战线，美军在战斗中伤亡了一万二千六百多人；到了去年冬季，美国侵略者虽然又拼凑起了四个李伪军师到前线，一共有十四个师的李伪军守了三分之二的战线，但是美军的伤亡却增加到了一万四千二百多人。这两个冬季作战的对比，说明了敌我力量的变化是向着对我军有利的方面发展，我军的战斗力量已经变得更加强大，给敌人的打击已愈来愈加沉重。
    从今年三月以来，我军又在前线展开了比冬季作战更积极的春季作战。仅仅在三、四月份中，我军就和敌军作战四百多次，消灭敌军达三万多名。
    最近半年来我军的胜利是巨大的。这个胜利不是轻易得来的，它是和我们两年多以来的努力分不开的。
    谁都知道，美国侵略军是一支武装到牙齿的残暴的军队，它是一支自恃有着在装备上和技术上优势的骄横的侵略军队。这支侵略军队是必须打败的，也是一定可以被打败的。我们中国人民志愿军显示了自己不可战胜的威力，以劣势的装备打败了它。我们志愿军在进攻的运动战中，以大胆勇敢包围、迂回、穿插、分割，大踏步前进，主动地转移，胜利地进行了五次战役，把美国侵略军赶回到它发动侵略的出发地三八线附近；在积极的防御作战中，我们志愿军又在三八线附近构筑了坚固的工事，建立了打不垮，炸不烂的钢铁阵地，并且运用了阻击、反击、伏击、袭击、狙击等灵活作战的手段，继续大量地消耗和歼灭了敌军。在经过了将近一年的稳定战线的阵地防御作战以后，我军从去年九月间起，便不断地举行了战术性的攻坚作战，无论敌军的阵地构筑得怎样坚固，并且也有了坑道工事作依靠，但是，我军仍是攻占了不少敌军的阵地，并且整排整连地消灭了据守在阵地上的敌人。我们志愿军已锻炼成为一支能攻能守，智勇双全，具有丰富作战经验的强大无敌的力量，我们正从胜利走向更大胜利；相反的，美国侵略军则是愈打愈坏，继续走着“下坡路”，从失败走向更大的失败。
    我们志愿军是伟大中国人民的优秀儿女组成的部队，我们满怀着热爱和平、热爱祖国、憎恨敌人的心情，雄赳赳气昂昂地走上朝鲜战场，和朝鲜人民军并肩作战，打击美国侵略者。我们懂得我们所进行的战争是正义的、反侵略战争。因此在进攻中能够勇往直前，毫不退缩；在防御中能够坚韧沉着，顽强守备；在困难面前决不低头，能够忍受艰苦、排除万难，发挥智慧和创造，为完成任务，争取胜利而奋斗。我们志愿军就是这样充分地表现了压倒敌人，战胜敌人的英雄气概，出现了无数可歌可泣的英雄人物和英雄事迹。在光辉的上甘岭战役中，我志愿军参战部队同志们的思想觉悟已达到了新的高峰，普遍地表现了特殊的英勇顽强，像黄继光、孙占元、邱少云那样在紧急关头舍身歼敌，换取整个胜利的英雄，在某部已被知道的就有三十一个人。像易才学那样智勇双全的杰出人物，也出现了不少。参战的所有战士在任何严重情况下都能积极战斗，坚信胜利。为了胜利，许多轻伤员坚持作战，不下火线；重伤员为了让更多的人继续战斗，就自己爬下火线，拒绝别人抬运。炮兵部队的指挥员、战斗员也发挥了极大的勇敢精神，在敌炮敌机的狂轰滥炸下坚持战斗，积极主动地支援步兵，猛烈地轰击敌人。运输部队也表现了最大的英勇和忘我的精神，许多汽车司机连续几昼夜不睡觉，饿了就拿出馒头，一边开车一边吃。他们自己装车、卸车，在敌机和敌炮的封锁线下来回奔驶，保证了对前线弹药和粮食的供应。徒步运输部队也冒着敌人炮火封锁背送着超出常人体力所能背送的分量，有的甚至一次背送二百斤，有的在战斗需要时就勇敢地参加了战斗。在这样一支具有高度思想觉悟的人民军队面前，是没有什么敌人不能被战胜的。
    我国人民志愿军在朝鲜战场上的伟大的历史性的胜利，粉碎了美帝国主义侵占全部朝鲜进攻我国的罪恶阴谋，保卫了朝鲜民主主义人民共和国的独立，保卫了祖国的安全，对世界保卫和平的事业作了巨大贡献，祖国人民、朝鲜人民和全世界爱好和平的人民赋予我们极其崇高的荣誉，称呼我们是最可爱的人，是保卫和平的英雄部队。但是，这个荣誉应该属于伟大的祖国和全力支援我们的祖国人民。
    我们伟大祖国的人民在毛主席教养下，发扬了高度的爱国主义和国际主义精神，在国内开展了轰轰烈烈的抗美援朝运动，并且提出了志愿军要什么给什么，要人有人，要钱有钱的口号，全力支援我们。在祖国人民的全力支援下，我们有了充足的弹药、物质的供应。我们吃得饱，吃得好，还有余粮；我们穿得暖，穿得好，而且穿得及时。去年冬天的棉衣在十月间就运到了前线；今年的夏衣，在三月中旬就送到了我们手中。在祖国人民的支援下，我们志愿军的装备改善了，我们已经有了一支强大的炮兵部队和年青的坦克部队、空军部队。祖国人民还给我们运来了大批精神食粮，不断给我们以物质的慰劳和精神的鼓励。去年十月派了第二届赴朝慰问团带着大批慰劳品到前线来慰劳我们；今年又派了文艺工作团到前线来作慰问演出。我们全体同志深深感谢毛主席给予我们的无微不至的关怀，感谢祖国人民给予我们的全力支援。志愿军的胜利，是祖国人民全力支援的结果。光荣属于我们伟大的祖国人民。
    光荣也应该属于英勇的朝鲜人民及其军队。在将近三年的反侵略战争中，朝鲜人民军愈战愈强，也锻炼成了一支钢铁般强大的武装力量。英雄的朝鲜人民军不仅是朝鲜人民的解放者和保卫者，而且是亚洲和世界和平的忠诚的保卫者。我志愿军在和朝鲜人民军两年多来的并肩作战中，互相支援、互相帮助、互相学习，共同取得了伟大的胜利，我们以有这样亲密的战友而骄傲。英雄的朝鲜人民在金日成首相、朝鲜劳动党和政府的领导下，坚持了反抗美国侵略者，争取祖国独立、自由的伟大斗争。朝鲜人民备受了美国侵略者所给予的深重灾难，但他们并不气馁、悲伤，却是发扬了朝鲜民族勇敢、勤劳、坚苦奋斗的传统精神，充满着胜利信心，努力生产，支援前线。两年多来，我们同朝鲜人民同甘苦，共患难，建立了深厚的兄弟般的友谊。朝鲜人民也更加热爱和支援我军。在上甘岭战役中，战地有八千四百二十九个朝鲜男女居民、劳动党员和地方政府干部热烈地参加了支援我军的工作。他们在炮火下十分细心体贴地抬运伤员，在到前线去的路上设立茶水站，招待我军过往人员，并且组织歌舞队到部队中进行慰问演出。在这些支援我军的朝鲜人民中，出现了如舍身掩护我军伤员的伟大国际主义者朴在根烈士，为我军伤员输血的妇女朴炳玉，为我军伤员洗了一千多件血衣的妇女咸在福等一百五十多位模范人物。我们有了朝鲜人民的拥护和支援，我们便立在了必胜不败的地上。
    光荣也应该属于以苏联为首的和平民主阵营和全世界爱好和平的人民。他们对我们的声援，和他们反对侵略、保卫和平的斗争，给予了我们以极大的鼓舞。我们的斗争是全世界人民保卫和平斗争的一部分，我们的胜利，就是全世界和平人民的胜利，我们的光荣，也是全世界和平人民的光荣。现在，中断了半年之久的朝鲜停战谈判恢复了，这是我们为了远东和世界和平，实现朝鲜的停战而一贯努力的结果。我们为了扫除造成朝鲜停战谈判唯一的障碍就是在全部战俘遣返问题上的分歧，在遣返全部战俘的步骤、方法等方面作了让步。但是，我们知道，战俘遣返问题的合理解决，不是单凭我们一方的努力所能达到的，因此，我们志愿军全体指挥员、战斗员要对敌人保持高度的警惕，要以我们坚持不懈的斗争来争取朝鲜问题的公平合理的解决。
    亲爱的同胞们，同志们！当我们这次回到祖国首都参观访问的时候，我国工会全国第七次代表大会正在首都开会。全国工人阶级在国家建设中将要更大地发挥领导作用、劳动热情和创造精神，并团结全国人民为保证完成和超额完成国家建设计划，实现国家工业化并将祖国引导向社会主义前途。我们祝贺工会全国代表大会的圆满成功，预祝我们国家一九五三年经济建设计划的胜利完成。我们一定要为保卫祖国的大规模经济建设，为争取抗美援朝斗争的彻底胜利而继续努力奋斗！亲爱的同胞们，同志们，只要有我们在斗争，你们尽管放心地建设吧！（新华社）
