(Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, May 8th) Zhang Jiafu, a representative of the Chinese Academy of Sciences Visiting Delegation to the Soviet Union, spoke to a reporter from this agency, describing the gains from this visit to the Soviet Union. He said: With the enthusiastic help of the Soviet scientific community, the delegation studied the rich experiences of the Soviet Academy of Sciences in organization, planning, training of cadres, and research methods, and achieved great gains. The greatest gain was the understanding of academic thought.

Zhang Jiafu said: Before the delegation went abroad, many scientific workers also believed that theory should be linked to practice and serve the people, but this issue was not completely resolved ideologically. After visiting the Soviet Union, this problem was naturally resolved ideologically. In the research plans of the Soviet Academy of Sciences and in the conversations of Soviet scientists, one frequently encounters the concrete practical problems of communist construction projects and factories. When the delegation visited factories, it often saw scientific achievements being concretely applied to practical work. The scope of Soviet scientific research is very broad, ranging from the biological world to the formation of the universe, but there is a central goal that is never relaxed, and that is to serve communist construction and to ensure the completion of the task of transitioning from socialism to communism. Academician Nesmeyanov, President of the Soviet Academy of Sciences, said that in the Soviet Union, no scientist stands outside the overall plan of the state. The delegation saw that this was indeed the case. Soviet scientific research institutions maintain good ties with production enterprises and even with producers. The delegation saw mechanized and automated equipment everywhere in the factories. The result of this application of scientific achievements is that it greatly reduces the physical labor of workers. The delegation also saw many female workers participating in work in heavy industrial factories such as automobiles and turbines, which is the result of the fact that labor has been reduced to the level of simply operating and managing machines. Constantly using scientific achievements to promote production, and in turn using the experience of production practice to enrich science. This continuous creative cooperation between science and production is precisely to eliminate the differences between manual and mental labor and to prepare conditions for moving towards a communist society. Zhang Jiafu said: Comrade Malenkov pointed out in his report to the 19th Congress of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union that it is necessary to further develop advanced Soviet science so that it occupies the first place in the world. This requires all branches of science to occupy the first place in the world. In fact, the delegation personally saw that many departments of science in the Soviet Union have already occupied the first place in the world. One of the reasons for achieving this great achievement is that Soviet scientists are guided by Marxism-Leninism and dialectical materialism. In the Soviet Union, students in all departments are required to study Marxism-Leninism, and graduate students in all departments are required to study philosophy. Soviet natural scientists, following the teachings of Comrade Stalin, regard social science as a compulsory subject. Therefore, the political and ideological level of Soviet natural scientists is very high. They are very clear about the purpose of their research work and its place in the overall picture. Therefore, although Soviet scientific research work is very detailed, it is closely linked and forms an organic whole. Many research tasks are carried out by scientists from various disciplines who conduct separate studies, hold regular comprehensive discussions to exchange opinions, and then collectively synthesize them to complete the tasks.

Zhang Jiafu expressed infinite respect for the qualities of the Soviet people. He said: Everyone in the delegation was moved by the enthusiasm and care of the Soviet people and received a profound education in internationalism. Soviet scientific workers were afraid that we knew too little and were willing to introduce their experiences to us as much as possible. Their heartfelt hope and desire for the rapid growth of New China was revealed at all times and in all places. Zhang Jiafu finally said: The Soviet people, nurtured by the Party of Lenin and Stalin, are completely new types of people. Their earnestness, down-to-earthness, and high sense of political responsibility are the inexhaustible source of the Soviet Union's unparalleled strength and continuous growth.

    中国科学院访苏代表团代表张稼夫
    谈学习苏联学术思想方面的收获
    【新华社莫斯科八日电】中国科学院访苏代表团代表张稼夫对本社记者发表谈话，叙述这次访问苏联的收获。他说：这次代表团在苏联科学界的热情帮助下，学习了苏联科学院在组织、计划、培养干部和研究方法等等方面的丰富经验，取得了很大的收获。最大的收获是学术思想方面的领会。
    张稼夫说：在代表团出国之前，许多科学工作者也认为理论要联系实际，要为人民服务，但在思想上没有完全解决。在苏联进行参观之后，这个问题便自然而然地在思想上解决了。在苏联科学院的研究计划中，在苏联科学家的谈话中，经常接触到共产主义建设工程和工厂的具体实际问题，代表团到工厂参观时又经常看到科学成就被具体运用到实际工作中。苏联科学研究的范围非常广泛，从生物世界到宇宙形成都在研究之列，但有一个从来不放松的中心目标，这就是为共产主义建设服务，为保证完成从社会主义过渡到共产主义的任务服务。苏联科学院涅斯米扬诺夫院长说过，在苏联没有一个科学家站在国家整个计划之外。代表团所看见的情形，确实是这样的。苏联的科学研究机关，都和生产企业部门、甚至和生产者保持着很好的联系。代表团在工厂中到处看见机械化自动化的设备，这种采用科学成就的结果就大大减轻了工人的体力劳动。代表团在像汽车和透平这些重工业工厂中也看到有很多女工参加工作，这是由于劳动已减轻到只是操纵和管理机器程度的结果。不断用科学成就去推进生产，反过来又以生产实践的经验来丰富科学。这种科学与生产之间的不断的创造性合作，正是为消灭体力劳动和脑力劳动之间的差别，为着走向共产主义社会准备条件。张稼夫说：马林科夫同志在苏联共产党第十九次代表大会上的报告中指出，要进一步发展先进的苏维埃科学，使它在世界上居第一位。这是要求所有各门科学都占世界第一位。事实上，代表团亲眼看到苏联许多部门科学已经占世界第一位。取得这种伟大成就的原因之一，是由于苏联科学家以马克思列宁主义、以辩证唯物主义为指导思想。在苏联，各科大学生都要修读马克思列宁主义课，各科研究生都要修读哲学。苏联自然科学家遵循斯大林同志的教导，把社会科学当作必修的课目。所以苏联自然科学家的政治思想水平都很高。他们对于自己研究工作的目的性以及它在总体中所占的位置，都是十分明确的。因此，苏联科学研究工作虽然分得很细，但又是紧密联系成为有机的整体。很多研究任务是由各门科学家分别研究，定期综合讨论交换意见，然后又集中地综合起来完成的。
    张稼夫对苏联人的品质表示无限的尊敬。他说：代表团的每一个人都为苏联人民的热情和关怀所感动，受了一次深刻的国际主义教育。苏联科学工作者惟恐我们知道得太少，愿意尽量把自己的经验介绍给我们。他们殷切地希望新中国迅速成长起来的那种心情和愿望，随时随地都表露出来。张稼夫最后说：在列宁—斯大林党的教养下的苏联人民，是完全新型的人民，他们那种认真、踏实和高度的政治责任心；就是苏联国力之所以无比强大和不断增长的不竭的源泉。
