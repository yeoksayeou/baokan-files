    Congratulate the Japan-China Friendship Association on Holding Its Third National Congress
    [Xinhua News Agency, 28th] The Chinese People's Committee for World Peace and eight other organizations sent a telegram to the Japan-China Friendship Association on the 28th, congratulating them on the third national congress of the Japan-China Friendship Association to be held on May 30th and 31st. The congratulatory telegram is as follows: To the Third National Congress of the Japan-China Friendship Association:

    We are delighted to learn that your association is holding its third national congress, and we extend our warm congratulations.

    In recent years, your association has made significant efforts to strengthen the friendship between the Chinese and Japanese people, promote cultural exchange between the people of China and Japan, develop Sino-Japanese trade on the basis of equality and mutual benefit, assist Japanese nationals in China to return to their country, and care for the difficulties of Chinese nationals in Japan. Mutual understanding and friendship between the people of China and Japan are of great significance for the defense of peace in the Far East and the world. This mutual understanding and friendship should not be hindered by any artificial barriers, nor should it be harmed by any malicious deceptive propaganda. We believe that with the passage of time, the mutual understanding and friendship between the Chinese and Japanese people will grow stronger and more consolidated.

    We, the Chinese people, based on our own personal experience, deeply sympathize with the plight of the Japanese people today. We are willing to work together with all peace-loving Japanese people to defend peace in the East and the world. We sincerely hope that the Japanese people will win victory in the struggle for Japan's independence, peace, and democracy!

    We wish the congress success!
