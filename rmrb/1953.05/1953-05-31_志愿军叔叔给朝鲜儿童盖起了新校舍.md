　　Volunteer Army Uncles Build New Schoolhouses for Korean Children

　　The soldiers of a certain unit of the Volunteer Army built two new schoolhouses capable of accommodating three to four hundred students for the local children. The walls of the new schoolhouses are made of stone and are one meter thick. There are eight large windows in the front and back. The house is densely covered with wood, which is covered with one meter of soil, and on top of that is a pointed roof made of lead sheets. The top and sides can withstand machine gun bullets. The schoolhouses are surrounded by rows of small pine trees, with a tall school gate made of pine branches in front, and a sturdy small wooden bridge over the stream next to it.

　　There used to be a primary school here. However, it was brutally bombed by American aerial bandits. The children in this area insisted on attending classes in the woods in the gully. During the cold season and when it was windy and rainy, they had to study at home on their own. The commanders and fighters of a certain unit of the Volunteer Army stationed there were both angry and saddened when they saw this situation. Therefore, after assisting the residents in completing spring plowing, sowing, and afforestation, they formed a construction engineering team of ninety-two people to build new schoolhouses for the children.

　　Encouraged by the slogan "Let the Korean children go to school early and study with peace of mind!", the Volunteer Army warriors overcame difficulties such as the lack of ready-made materials and tools, and completed all the construction work in eight days.

　　On the day the new schoolhouses were completed, the local residents were as happy as if they had encountered a great happy event. In this spacious and beautiful new schoolhouse, more than 500 people, including representatives of local Party and government organs, and men, women, and children dressed in festive costumes, held a grand meeting to thank the selfless assistance of the Volunteer Army and celebrate the successful construction of the new schoolhouses. At the meeting, they presented a silk banner to a certain unit of the Volunteer Army and offered flowers to the commanders and fighters of a certain unit of the Volunteer Army to pay their respects. A Korean military family member, Old Woman Liang, brought her two young sons who were about to attend this new school, and walked more than ten li to attend the meeting. With tears in her eyes, she held a Volunteer Army soldier's hand tightly and said, "You not only help us kill the enemy in the front and protect our safety, but also help us with spring plowing in the rear, and build new schools for our children at the same time. I am truly grateful beyond words." She patted her two young sons beside her and said, "Children! Remember to study hard and repay the kindness of the Volunteer Army uncles!" The children who regained their place of learning were filled with gratitude to the Volunteer Army uncles. Their representatives said at the meeting: "The American aerial bandits destroyed our paradise, and the Volunteer Army uncles built new schoolhouses for us. All of us students are determined to study hard and become outstanding talents for the motherland. We will actively support the uncles of the Korean and Chinese People's Armies and strive for greater victories." (Xinhua News Agency)

    志愿军叔叔给朝鲜儿童盖起了新校舍
    志愿军某部的战士们给驻地的少年儿童们盖起了两座可容三、四百个学生的新校舍。新校舍的墙壁是用石头砌成的，有一公尺厚。前后开着八个大窗子。房子上面密密地铺着木料，木料上面盖着一公尺厚的泥土，再上面就是用铅板钉成的尖屋顶。顶上和四周都可以挡机枪子弹。校舍四周有一排排的小松树，前面有用松枝搭成的高大校门，旁边的小溪上还架着坚实的小木桥。
    这里原来也有一所小学校。但是，美国空中强盗残暴地把它炸毁了。这一带的少年儿童们就在山沟里的树林中坚持上课学习，在严寒时节和刮风下雨的时候，只得在家中自修。驻在当地的志愿军某部指挥员和战斗员们，看到这种情形，又愤怒，又难过。于是，他们在协助居民完成春耕播种和植树造林等工作以后，组成了一支九十二人的建筑工程队，为孩子们动手建筑新校舍。
    在“让朝鲜小朋友们早日上学，安心学习！”的口号的鼓舞下，志愿军的勇士们战胜了没有现成材料和工具等困难，在八天中就完成了全部建筑工程。
    新校舍落成这一天，当地居民真像逢到了大喜事一样。在这个宽敞美丽的新校舍里，当地党、政机关的代表和穿着节日盛装的男女居民及小朋友们共五百多人，举行了一个隆重的大会，来感谢志愿军的无私援助，庆祝新校舍的建筑成功。会上，他们献给志愿军某部一面锦旗，并向志愿军某部的指挥员和战斗员们献花致敬。有位朝鲜军属梁老大娘，带着她两个将要到这个新学校念书的小儿子，走了十几里路来参加大会。她含着热泪，紧握着一位志愿军战士的手说：“你们不但在前方帮助我们杀敌，保卫了我们的安全，而且在后方帮助我们春耕，同时又给我们的孩子们建造新学校。我真有说不出的感激。”她用手拍着她身旁的两个小儿子说：“孩子们！记住，要努力学习，好好报答志愿军叔叔们的恩情啊！”重新获得学习场所的孩子们对志愿军叔叔们充满了感激。他们选出的代表在大会上说：“美国空中强盗毁坏了我们的乐园，志愿军叔叔们给我们盖起了新校舍。我们全体同学决心努力学习，成为祖国的优秀人才。我们要积极支援朝中人民军队的叔叔们，争取更大的胜利。”（新华社）
