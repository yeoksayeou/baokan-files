Yulin County, Guangxi Province

Policy Promotion Not Well Done, People's Production Enthusiasm Low

The spring plowing production in the rural areas of Yulin County, Guangxi Province, has entered a tense stage. In mid-April, the seedlings in the seedling fields had grown to about three inches, and in various townships, paddy fields where seedlings had been planted were already appearing. However, many farmers still cannot concentrate on production. Yulin County concluded its land reform review work in early February this year. From land reform to production and construction is a major turning point. Since the preparation for spring plowing, some ideological problems and concerns of cadres and the masses have not been well resolved, thus hindering the development of the spring plowing production campaign. Some farmers have even abandoned their fields. The most common ideological concern is the fear that increased production will lead to increased burdens. He Baishu, a poor peasant in Changfa Township, said, "If the rice grows best in April and May this year, there will be another assessment of yield. I don't know how much it will be assessed as!" Some farmers are afraid of a second land reform. In Shigui Township, some middle peasants even "donated land" or distributed land to their relatives. Many farmers do not have a correct understanding of socialism. The township head of Chengjun Township in the Fifth District said to the mutual aid team members: "Now there is no need to engage in mutual aid teams, in two years we will eat from the big pot." As a result, five households withdrew from the team. Some farmers see others engaging in mutual aid teams and working hard to produce, and say: "Why are you working so hard? I won't put in any effort. In two years, when everything is 'merged,' I will have a share." Some eat a big meal every time they go to the town to attend the market, and say: "In this world, what's the point of not eating? Soon everything will be 'combined,' socialism is coming soon." Many farmers have difficulties in production and life, but they do not try to find solutions themselves and hope for government relief. On the other hand, middle peasants with surplus grain dare not lend it out. They say: "The worst thing is not being repaid, and also getting labeled with the hat of 'usurious exploitation.'" Some landlords have also abandoned their fields. Landlords in Jingu Township in the Second District abandoned nearly forty mu of land, and landlords in Hemu Township also abandoned more than thirty mu of land. (Here, dozens of mu of land are very precious. During land reform, each peasant received an average of just over one mu of paddy field.)

Many townships forced farmers to organize mutual aid teams in the past, and now that they have collapsed, the cadres are anxious. When the cadres of the Seventh District's Datang Township were promoting mutual aid and cooperation and organizing mutual aid teams, they did not dare to boldly promote the principle of "voluntary participation," fearing that after they volunteered, the mutual aid teams would disband, "collapse, and there would be no way to organize them again." Wanlong Township vigorously promoted the organizational principle of voluntary participation and mutual benefit, but relaxed its leadership. The old "mutual aid teams" that were forcibly organized collapsed, but the newly organized mutual aid teams were all "bamboo doors facing bamboo doors, wooden doors facing wooden doors." People with cattle and capital "organized" themselves, and poor peasants did not join.

In newly liberated areas, especially in Guangxi, most of which are areas where land reform has just ended, the most important thing at present is to stabilize the new production relations in rural areas so that the working masses can give full play to their production enthusiasm on their own land. The main contradiction is the contradiction between fluctuating ideas and the demand for developing production, not the contradiction between conservative ideas and advanced technology, nor the contradiction between the enthusiasm for individual production and mutual aid and cooperation. However, the Yulin County Committee of the Communist Party of China has ignored this point. Although the ideological problems of the masses have been discovered since the preparation for spring plowing, no active measures have been taken to solve them. When convening a joint meeting of district party secretaries and district heads to deploy work, they only vaguely deployed "at present, the movement to implement the Marriage Law has reached the stage of completion and summing up, and from now on, production will be the focus, combined with the regular implementation of the Marriage Law." The meeting also deployed "vigorously publicizing agricultural production increase," but the focus was only on deploying "promoting advanced methods of seed selection and sowing," "vigorously promoting cultivation techniques and advanced experience"; on the other hand, it focused on and specifically deployed the summary and conclusion of the Marriage Law implementation campaign month. After the district party secretaries and district heads returned, they deployed it in the same way; the cadres below also did the same. Everyone was busy summing up the Marriage Law implementation campaign, neglecting spring plowing production. Two district-level cadres working in Daluxiang, the county's key production area, were withdrawn because the district wanted to summarize the Marriage Law implementation campaign. Although "grasping production" was later proposed, not enough emphasis was still placed on publicizing production policies and helping the masses solve specific difficulties. After Daluxiang, the county's key production area, publicized the "Ten Measures" issued by the Central South Administrative Committee and the Guangxi Provincial People's Government's agricultural production announcement, the peasants revealed some ideological situations; however, the cadres did not help solve them well. When county and district cadres publicized policies, they only read the articles to the township cadres. The township cadres did not learn well and did not understand, so naturally they could not explain them well to the masses of peasants. In the Second District, out of the 25 townships in the whole district, only seven townships publicized the "Ten Measures" and the Guangxi Provincial People's Government's announcement on agricultural production at meetings of township cadres and village representatives in mid-April, and the remaining 18 townships had never publicized them once. In the Long'an area of the Eighth District, out of the 11 townships, only two key townships publicized them briefly, and the rest only read the articles at the township cadre meetings. The cadres in each district ignored the production concerns of the masses and were eager to engage in mutual aid teams and new agricultural science and technology. When these were not welcomed or accepted by the peasants, they complained that the masses were "backward" and "conservative." As a result, they hindered the current spring plowing production campaign. A cadre from the special district surnamed Shi came to Zhongfeng Township in the Seventh District. He was busy in the township all day asking everyone to make standard seedling fields, thin out seedlings and densely plant them, etc., but he did not pay attention to what the peasants were thinking, what their difficulties were, and what their requirements were. After he left, the peasants said: "Comrade Shi is gone, that's great! He was always pestering us here, and we really didn't know how busy we were!"

Because the masses' concerns have not been dispelled, the patriotic production increase campaign has not been able to develop, and the spring plowing season is getting more and more urgent, but the situation reflected below is always the old situation. The cadres feel that the production movement cannot be carried out, and they are also very distressed.

The spring plowing production campaign can be launched quickly, and the policies can be accepted by the masses, but first of all, the policies must meet the masses. In Yulin, there are already some places that have done it right and solved the problems. For example, in Qituan Township in the Ninth District, the township cadres were organized to seriously study the policies, and the thinking of the masses was clarified. The policies were patiently publicized and explained in response to their concerns. The masses were very happy after listening to them. The middle peasants lent out the grain they could not use, which solved the difficulties of poor peasants in terms of seeds and food. The peasants in Zhengyang Township in the Eighth District originally planned to abandon 150 mu of land. After the deputy district head personally explained and publicized the "Ten Measures," the masses happily said: Since that's the case, there's no need to worry about no one cultivating it! Later, some of the masses still did not quite believe it, and they gave the deputy district head a piece of paper and said: "Comrade, please write down what you just said and stamp it." This shows that the masses support our policies, and it also shows that it is not easy for the masses to believe our policies. It is necessary to start from the masses' level of awareness and personal experience and show the facts to the masses. (Zhang Zhaoguang)

### 广西省郁林县  政策宣传没做好，群众生产劲头小

    广西省郁林县
    政策宣传没做好，群众生产劲头小
    广西省郁林县农村春耕生产，已经进入了紧张阶段。四月中旬，秧地里秧苗就已长到了三寸左右，各乡已经出现了一块一块插下了秧苗的水田。可是，许多农民至今还不能安心生产。郁林县是在今年二月初结束土地改革复查工作的，由土地改革到生产建设，是个大拐弯；从准备春耕到现在，干部、群众的一些思想问题和顾虑，一直没有得到很好的解决，因而阻碍着春耕生产运动的开展；有些农民甚至把田地丢荒了。最普遍的思想顾虑是怕增产了会增加负担。长发乡贫农何八叔说：“今年四、五月禾生得最好，又要评定产量，不知道要评成多少啦！”有的农民怕会有第二次土地改革，石柜乡还有中农“献田”，或把田分给自己的亲戚。许多农民对社会主义没有正确的认识，五区成均乡乡长对互助组员说：“现在不用搞互助组了，过两年吃大锅饭了。”于是就有五户退组了。有的农民看见别人搞互助组，努力劳动生产，就说：“你们这样下劲干什么，我不下力，过两年‘合紧’了，我也有一份。”有的每次到镇里赶集就大吃一顿，还说：“这样世界，不吃做什么，不久就‘并并紧’了，社会主义快到了。”有许多农民在生产生活上都有困难，自己又不想办法，希望政府救济。另一方面，有余粮的中农又不敢借贷。他们说：“最怕有借不还，还要加上个‘高利贷剥削’的帽子。”地主有的也荒了田，二区金谷乡地主荒田近四十亩，和睦乡地主也丢荒了三十多亩田。（在这里几十亩田是十分宝贵的，土地改革时农民每人平均才得一亩多水田。）
    许多乡过去强迫农民组织了互助组，现在垮台了，干部心里就着急起来。七区大塘乡在宣传互助合作，组织互助组时，区干部就不敢大胆宣传“自愿”这个原则，怕他们自愿之后，互助组散了，“垮台了，没法再组织”。万隆乡大力宣传了自愿互利的组织原则，可是又放松了领导，旧的强迫组织起来的“互助组”是垮台了，新组织的互助组却都是“竹门对竹门，木门对木门”，有人有牛有资本的“组织”起来了，贫苦农民没有组织进去。
    在晚解放地区，特别是广西，大部是土地改革刚结束的地区，目前最重要的是稳定农村新的生产关系，使劳动群众能在自己的土地上尽量发挥生产积极性。主要矛盾是动荡不定的思想和发展生产的要求的矛盾，还不是保守思想与先进技术的矛盾，也还不是个体生产积极性与互助合作的矛盾。中共郁林县委却忽略了这一点。虽然自准备春耕以来就发现了群众的思想问题，却一直没有积极地设法解决。在召开区委书记、区长联席会议布置工作的时候，只是泛泛地布置“目前是贯彻婚姻法运动到了结束与总结阶段，今后以生产为中心，结合经常的贯彻婚姻法”。会上也布置了“大张旗鼓宣传农业增产”，但重点只是布置了“推广选种、播种的先进方法”，“大力推广耕作技术，先进经验”；另一方面又着重而具体地布置贯彻婚姻法运动月的总结结束工作。区委书记、区长回去后，照样布置下去；下面干部也照样做下去。大家都忙于总结贯彻婚姻法运动，忽略了春耕生产。在县的生产重点大路乡工作的两个区级干部，为了区里要总结贯彻婚姻法运动，被抽回了一个。后来虽提出了“抓生产”，但对宣传生产政策、帮助群众解决具体困难，仍然重视不够。县的生产重点大路乡宣传了中南行政委员会发布的“十项措施”和广西省人民政府农业生产布告以后，农民暴露了一些思想情况；可是，干部没有很好地帮助解决。县、区干部宣传政策的时候，只是拿条文来念给乡干部听。乡干部学不好，听不懂，自然也就不能向农民群众很好地解释。二区全区二十五个乡，到四月中旬只有七个乡在乡干部、村代表等会议上宣传过“十项措施”和广西省人民政府农业生产的布告，其余十八个乡未曾宣传过一次。八区龙安片十一个乡，也只有两个重点乡宣传过一下，其余都只是在乡干部会议上读了一下条文。各区干部对群众的生产顾虑置之不理，而急于搞互助组、搞新的农业科学技术。当这些未被农民所欢迎，所接受时，就埋怨群众“落后”、“保守”。结果，反而妨碍了当前的春耕生产运动。七区中凤乡来了一个专区姓施的干部，他整天在乡里忙着要大家做合式秧田、疏株密植等等，却没有理会农民心里在想什么，困难是什么，要求是什么。他走后农民说：“施同志走了，好极啦！他在这里老是缠着我们，真不知我们工作忙！”
    因为群众顾虑未打消，所以爱国增产运动老是开展不起来，春耕季节越来越紧迫，下面反映的情况却老是旧情况。干部觉得生产运动开展不了，也苦闷得很。
    春耕生产运动是能迅速开展的，政策是能为群众接受的，但首先要政策和群众见面。在郁林也已经有好些地方做对了，解决了问题的。像九区七团乡，组织乡干部认真学习了政策，又摸清群众的思想，针对顾虑耐心地宣传讲解，群众听了很高兴，中农把自己用不完的谷借出了，解决了贫苦农民的籽种、口粮等困难。八区正阳乡农民原打算把一百五十亩田丢荒，经过副区长亲自讲解、宣传“十项措施”，群众高兴地说：既是这样，不怕没人耕了！后来有些群众还不大相信，拿了张纸给副区长说：“同志，请把你刚才讲的写上，盖上章。”这说明群众是拥护我们的政策的，也说明要群众相信我们的政策是不容易的，必须从群众的觉悟水平和切身经验出发，用事实表现给群众看。（张朝光）
