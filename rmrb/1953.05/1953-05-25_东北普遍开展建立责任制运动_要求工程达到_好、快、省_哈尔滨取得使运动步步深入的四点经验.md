Xinhua News Agency, Shenyang, May 23rd: A mass responsibility system establishment campaign has been universally launched by basic construction departments in Northeast China. This movement will provide a strong guarantee for this year's basic construction projects in Northeast China to achieve the requirements of "good, fast, and economical."

Basic construction departments in Northeast China, aiming at the varying degrees of lack of responsibility that occurred in various construction sites during construction preparation, have identified the establishment of a responsibility system as the central link in their work for the second quarter of this year. Basic construction departments in Harbin, Shenyang, Benxi, and other places launched the responsibility system establishment campaign as early as mid-April. The CPC Jilin Provincial Committee and the Dalian Municipal Committee also recently convened responsible cadres from various basic construction departments to specifically arrange the work of establishing the responsibility system. In carrying out this movement, basic construction departments in various places first explained the important significance of projects achieving "good, fast, and economical" to cadres and workers, emphasized learning from advanced experience, and regarded mobilizing technical personnel and staff as an important task in the movement. In the responsibility system establishment movement, all basic construction units fully mobilized employees to focus on key issues that have the greatest impact on the project, exposing phenomena of no one being responsible on the one hand, and summarizing experience and implementing the principle of "inspecting while building" on the other. For example, after the Construction Engineering Company of the Ministry of Heavy Industry of the Central People's Government exposed more than 300 cases of no one being responsible, it promptly concentrated the opinions of employees based on the principle of "inspecting while building" and initially formulated some practical and feasible systems.

In the course of the movement, some leading cadres in individual units did not pay enough attention to the work of establishing the responsibility system. For example, some emphasized "busy work, no time," and "problems are not big"; some emphasized that "doing the movement is a matter for the Party and the trade union"; some had incorrect ideas of "rectifying" subordinates or fearing being held accountable; and some units did not grasp the main problems in connection with current work when carrying out this movement, so not many problems were solved. At present, under the leadership of the CPC Committee, these units are correcting these deviations to develop the entire movement in a sound direction.

[Report from this newspaper] A mass responsibility system establishment campaign is being launched by basic construction departments in Harbin City.

Basic construction departments in Harbin City carried out a responsibility system establishment campaign last year. However, this year many new employees have been added to the various units, and half of the city's workers did not participate in last year's responsibility system establishment campaign, nor have they received winter training; many cadres have just been transferred from rural areas or promoted from workers, and they are not familiar with the set of working methods and systems in construction; at the same time, many engineering companies and construction site organizations have been newly established throughout the city, the institutions are not sound, and various management systems have not been established, and the responsibilities of employees are unclear. Even in those units that have established a responsibility system, many systems have not been adhered to and consolidated in the work because last year's emphasis was on solving the ideological problems of construction site managers and technicians. Therefore, during this year's construction preparation work, many phenomena of no one being responsible have arisen. This year, the proportion of complex factory building projects in Harbin has greatly increased. If the phenomenon of no one being responsible is not overcome from the management system, it will inevitably affect the quality and progress of this year's projects, causing serious losses to the national construction cause. Therefore, according to the instructions of the Northeast Bureau of the CPC Central Committee, all units have taken the establishment of a responsibility system as the central task of the second quarter and made mobilizations in mid-to-late April. By now, the movement has been launched throughout the city.

According to the current situation, to carry out a mass responsibility system establishment movement and deepen the movement step by step, the following tasks must be carried out: 1. Clarify the nature of the movement and unify leadership thinking. At the beginning of the movement, many administrative responsible cadres did not realize that the responsibility system establishment movement was a central link in improving their enterprise management and completing this year's tasks, but opposed this movement to the current construction work, feeling that they had no time to do it, and regarded the movement as only the affair of Party and mass organizations. Some comrades who do Party work also did not realize that Party political work must be carried out around the current central task in the enterprise, neglecting to lead this movement in a planned way, so that the enthusiasm of the masses could not be promptly guided to improve construction management. As a result, although the masses rose up to expose criticisms and put forward rationalization proposals, the phenomena of poor project quality and idle work on the construction site have not been improved. After studying these situations recently, the CPC Harbin Municipal Committee pointed out to the basic construction units in Harbin City: The responsibility system movement is a mass movement in the aspect of production reform. The purpose is to improve planning management, technical management, material and financial work, and welfare and safety work through the improvement of the ideological awareness of the masses, through the inspection of current construction work, unfolding mass criticism and self-criticism, and gradually establishing and improving various responsibility systems according to needs and possibilities, so as to achieve the goals of good, fast, economical, and safe. According to this instruction, all units are now unifying leadership thinking and work steps to further deepen the movement. 2. Conduct positive patriotic education for employees to inspire their consciousness and mobilize them to consciously participate in the movement. After the movement was launched, some staff members and technical personnel were afraid of taking responsibility. Those who had worked for a period of time wanted to define the scope of their and their unit's responsibilities as small as possible; those who were newly transferred or newly promoted felt that their business was not familiar, and more responsibilities would be too much to bear. Some workers regarded the establishment of a responsibility system as a matter for the management department and had little interest in the movement. In response to these ideas, many units generally combine the education of the responsibility system movement with the education of completing the three major tasks this year and implementing the spirit of the basic construction conference of the Northeast Bureau of the CPC Central Committee, especially linking the significance of the projects undertaken by each unit specifically with national industrialization and the relationship with the employees themselves, to conduct propaganda and mobilization, so that employees clearly understand the importance of the projects they are building, thus inspiring the consciousness of the masses of employees. They not only raised problems in construction management, but also put forward rationalization proposals to solve these problems. 3. Strengthen the work of staff and technical personnel. Many technical personnel and staff have concerns that "as soon as the movement comes, they will be rectified." Therefore, all units generally take the form of chat meetings and individual talks, targeting the characteristics of technical personnel and staff, to conduct ideological education. Individual units have achieved significant results by absorbing them to participate in the leadership of the movement. For example, after the chief engineer of the first construction site of the first engineering company of the Nonferrous Metals Industry Administration was absorbed to participate in the leadership, he took the initiative to study problems, draft plans to improve work, and actively unite other technical personnel to participate in the movement. 4. Closely combining with the current central work and establishing various responsibility systems in a step-by-step manner is the key to the victory of the movement. After the masses are mobilized, all units generally proceed from the actual situation. For those that have not started construction, they focus on rectifying the organization, determining the scope of business, formulating and discussing plans, and establishing administrative responsibility systems and planning responsibility systems to strive for early construction; those that have started construction determine different work priorities according to the characteristics of the work situation. However, most units focus on establishing and improving technical quality responsibility systems and technical supply responsibility systems, and then establish other responsibility systems. Like the first work area of the Engineering Company of the Electrical Engineering Bureau, in view of the importance of ensuring the quality of foundation projects for the entire project, before and after the start of construction, it focused on establishing a technical quality responsibility system, organizing employees to raise problems and improvement methods, so that the enthusiasm of employees was very concentrated, and the responsibility system gained rich content. The leadership also promptly concentrated the opinions of employees according to the principle of "opposing while building" and formulated them into systems, thus ensuring the quality of the project. However, there are also some units that do not proceed from the actual situation, and although the responsibility system has been established, the work has not been improved. Like the third construction site of the First Engineering Company of Songjiang Province, before the organizational structure was sound and the work objects of various types of work were determined, it established a planning responsibility system from bottom to top, resulting in the system being reduced to a formality.

    东北普遍开展建立责任制运动
    要求工程达到“好、快、省”
    哈尔滨取得使运动步步深入的四点经验
    【新华社沈阳二十三日电】东北各地基本建设部门普遍展开了群众性的建立责任制运动。这个运动将给今年东北各项基本建设工程达到“好、快、省”的要求提供有力的保证。
    东北各地基本建设部门，针对各个工地在施工准备工作中产生的程度不同的无人负责现象，把建立责任制确定为今年第二季度工作的中心环节。哈尔滨、沈阳、本溪等地的基本建设部门，早在四月中旬就展开了建立责任制运动。中共吉林省委、旅大市委也在最近召集各基本建设部门的负责干部，具体布置建立责任制的工作。各地基本建设部门在开展这一运动时，都首先在干部和工人中说明了工程达到“好、快、省”的重要意义，强调学习先进经验，并把发动技术人员和职员作为运动中的一项重要工作。在建立责任制运动中，各基本建设单位都充分发动职工围绕着一些影响工程最大的关键问题，一面揭发各种无人负责现象，一面总结经验，贯彻“边检查、边建设”的方针。如中央人民政府重工业部建设工程公司在揭发出三百多件无人负责现象后，根据“边检查、边建设”的方针，及时地集中了职工的意见，初步订立了一些切实可行的制度。
    在运动进行中，也有个别单位的领导干部对建立责任制这一工作重视不够。如有的强调“工作忙、没时间”、“有问题也不大”；有的强调“搞运动是党和工会的事”；有的存在着“整”下边或害怕追究责任的不正确思想；也有些单位在开展这一运动时，还没有结合当前工作抓住主要问题，因此解决的问题不多。目前，这些单位在中共党委的领导下，正在纠正这些偏向，使整个运动向健全的方向发展。
    【本报讯】哈尔滨市区内各基本建设部门正展开群众性的建立责任制运动。
    哈尔滨市区内各基本建设部门，去年曾经开展过建立责任制运动。但是今年各单位增加很多新职工，全市有一半的工人没参加过去年的建立责任制运动，也没有受过冬季训练；不少干部是刚从农村调来或从工人中提拔起来的，他们对于施工中的一套工作方法和制度都不熟悉；同时，全市还有不少的工程公司和工地组织是新建立起来的，机构不健全，各项管理制度都没有建立，职工的职责不清。即使在那些建立过责任制的单位，也因去年偏重于解决工地管理人员、技术人员的思想问题，许多制度都没有在工作中得到坚持与巩固。因此今年在施工准备工作当中，便产生了许多无人负责的现象。哈尔滨市今年复杂的厂房工程比重大大增加，无人负责现象如不从管理制度上加以克服，势必影响今年工程的质量和进度，给国家建设事业造成严重的损失。因此各单位都根据中共中央东北局的指示，以建立责任制为第二季度的中心工作，于四月中旬和下旬作了动员。到现在，运动已在全市展开。
    根据目前情况来看，要想开展一个群众性的建立责任制运动，并使运动步步深入，必须进行以下几项工作：一、明确认识运动的性质，统一领导思想。在运动开始时，不少行政负责干部没有认识到建立责任制运动是改善自己企业管理、完成今年任务的一个中心环节，而把这个运动与当前的施工工作对立起来，觉得没时间搞，将运动看作只是党群组织的事。有的做党的工作的同志，也没有认识必须把党的政治工作围绕目前企业中这个中心任务来进行，忽略了有计划地领导这一运动，因而不能将群众的积极性及时地引向改善施工管理的轨道上来，以致群众虽起来进行了揭发批判和提出了合理化建议，但施工现场存在的工程质量低劣和窝工现象仍然没有得到改善。中共哈尔滨市委员会于最近研究了这些情况后，向哈尔滨市各基本建设单位指出：责任制运动是属于生产改革方面的群众性运动，目的是通过群众的觉悟水平的提高，通过对当前各项施工工作的检查，展开群众性的批评与自我批评，并根据需要与可能逐步地建立和健全各种责任制度，从而使计划管理、技术管理、材料和财务工作、福利安全工作，得到初步的建立与改善，以便达到好、快、省、安全的目的。各单位根据这个指示，现正统一领导思想与工作步调，以便使运动继续深入一步。二、对职工进行正面的爱国主义教育，启发他们的觉悟，动员他们自觉地参加运动。运动展开之后，有些职员和技术人员怕负责任。做过一个时期工作的，想把自己及本单位的职责范围划得越小越好；新调来或新提拔的，则认为自己的业务都不熟，再来几条责任更担不起。有些工人把建立责任制看成是管理部门的事，对运动的兴趣不大。针对这些思想，许多单位一般地都将责任制运动的教育，和完成今年三大任务、贯彻中共中央东北局基本建设会议精神的教育结合起来，尤其是将各单位所承建的工程的意义，具体地和国家工业化以及与职工本身的关系联系起来，进行宣传鼓动，使职工清楚了解自己所修建工程的重要意义，因而启发了职工群众的自觉。他们不仅提出了施工管理当中的问题，而且提出合理化建议来解决这些问题。三、加强职员及技术人员的工作。不少技术人员及职员都有“运动一来就要挨整”的顾虑，因此，各单位一般地都针对技术人员、职员的特点，采取漫谈会和个别谈话的方式，进行思想教育。个别单位吸收他们参加运动的领导，收到的效果比较显著。如有色金属工业管理局第一工程公司第一工地的专责工程师被吸收参加领导之后，他就主动地研究问题，起草改进工作的方案，积极团结其他技术人员参加到运动里来。四、紧密结合当前中心工作，有步骤地建立各种责任制度，是运动取得胜利的关键。各单位在群众发动起来之后，一般地都从实际情况出发，未开工的，着重整顿组织，确定业务范围，制订、讨论计划，建立行政负责制和计划责任制，争取及早开工；已开工的，根据工作情况的特点，确定不同的工作重点。但多数单位都以建立与健全技术质量责任制、技术供应责任制为主，然后再建立其他责任制。像电工局工程公司第一工区，鉴于保证基础工程质量对整个工程有重要意义，在开工前后，以建立技术质量责任制为中心，组织职工提出问题和改进办法，使职工的热情非常集中，责任制也就获得了丰富的内容。领导方面又根据“边反边建”的方针，及时集中职工意见，订成制度，因而保证了工程质量。但是也有一些单位，不从实际情况出发，责任制虽然建立了，工作却未得到改进。像松江省第一工程公司第三工地，组织机构还未健全，各工种的工作对象还未确定，就自下而上地建立计划责任制，结果使制度流于形式。
