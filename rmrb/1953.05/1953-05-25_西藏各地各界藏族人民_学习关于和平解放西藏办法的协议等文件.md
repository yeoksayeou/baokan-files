The Tibetan people from all walks of life in Tibet have made progress in studying the "Agreement on Measures for the Peaceful Liberation of Tibet" and ethnic policies. Members of the Lhasa Patriotic Youth Cultural Association, Tibetan teachers from Lhasa Primary School and the Tibetan Cadre School of the Tibet Military Region, Tibetan cultural figures, and Tibetan people from all walks of life currently studying in the Social Education Class of the Tibet Military Region Cadre School have been studying in an organized manner since last year. Before "May Fourth" this year, the Lhasa Patriotic Youth Cultural Association also organized a central group to strengthen the leadership of the studies of more than 300 members. People from all walks of life in Xigaze often hold study seminars during festivals, inviting cadres from the Chinese People's Liberation Army stationed there to give reports. In October last year, Gyangze established the "Gyangze Study Committee," which was attended by local officials, nobles, chieftains, and heads of monasteries from Gyangze and neighboring areas. After studying, they further understood the spirit of the agreement and ethnic policies. In November last year, the Gyangze Study Committee organized five groups to conduct patriotic propaganda to farmers and herdsmen in nearby rural areas and pastures. At the same time, it published mimeographed Tibetan newspapers and Tibetan wall newspapers, reporting on the construction of the motherland and the improvement of the lives of people of all ethnic minorities. They care about various local construction undertakings and assist the Chinese People's Liberation Army in providing relief to the poor and distributing rural loans. Recently, they also participated in the preparatory work for the Gyangze People's Primary School and the Gyangze People's Hospital.

In order to help the Tibetan people study, the People's Liberation Army stationed in Tibet often prints and distributes large numbers of Tibetan policy documents. The Tibetan people cherish these documents very much and distribute them to relatives and friends living in remote areas.

    西藏各地各界藏族人民
    学习关于和平解放西藏办法的协议等文件
    西藏各地各界藏族人民学习“关于和平解放西藏办法的协议”和民族政策已有成绩。拉萨市爱国青年文化联谊会会员、拉萨小学和西藏军区干部学校的藏族教员、藏族文化界人士，以及现在西藏军区干部学校社会教育班学习的藏族各阶层人士，从去年就开始有组织地进行学习。拉萨市爱国青年文化联谊会在今年“五四”前，还组织了中心小组，加强对三百多会员学习的领导。日喀则各阶层人民经常在节日举行学习座谈会，邀请驻当地的中国人民解放军干部作报告。江孜在去年十月就成立了“江孜学习委员会”，江孜和邻近地区的地方官员、贵族、头人、寺院负责人等都参加学习。他们学习以后，进一步体会了协议和民族政策的精神。去年十一月，江孜学习委员会曾组织五个小组，到附近农村、牧场向农民、牧民进行爱国主义宣传；同时出版了油印藏文报和藏文墙报，报道祖国的建设和各地少数民族人民生活改善的情形。他们关心地方各种建设事业，协助中国人民解放军救济贫民，发放农村贷款。最近又参加了江孜人民小学和江孜人民医院的筹建工作。
    为了帮助西藏人民进行学习，驻西藏各地人民解放军时常印送大批藏文政策文件。藏族人民非常珍视这些文件，把它分送给住在偏僻地区的亲友们。
