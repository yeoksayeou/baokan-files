    【This Newspaper Dispatches】The Anshan Iron and Steel Company's various factories and mines are nearing the end of their discussion of the national plan. During the planning discussions, many factories and mines have strengthened their planning management work with a focus on improving operation plans. Some factories and mines have drafted operation plan proposals, while others have developed indicator charts and carried out key pilot projects. For example, the medium-sized rolling mill, building on its original preliminary operation plan, has changed its ten-day operation plan to a weekly operation plan after summarizing and researching. It has also established maintenance plans and raw material management systems and added indicator charts for straightening rollers and fuel supply. The casting pipe factory conducted a pilot operation plan in the first workshop, and after a week, it initially achieved results in improving production and quality. Starting in May, the General Machinery Factory increased indicator charts for tracking the overall progress of production and material supply plans, eliminating the disconnect between casting and processing.
    However, some factories and mines have been slower to act. Some cadres in these factories and mines see the discussion of the plan and the establishment of operation plans as opposing each other, and they see operation plans as too difficult. Leaders of individual units have not strongly supported this work, and have even transferred comrades who were participating in learning to create operation plans to do other work. There are also individual units that do not start from practical problems, but only make some charts and post them in the work sections in form, without establishing any systems. As a result, very few groups complete tasks according to the charts.
    In order to overcome the above shortcomings, according to the experience of good factories and mines, these factories and mines that are slow to act should first compile an operation plan proposal and submit it to the masses for implementation. At the same time, they should strengthen the dispatch system to ensure that dispatching is carried out according to the operation plan, grasp the production situation of the entire factory and each workshop, and identify and overcome weak links at any time. They should also do a good job in maintenance planning, clear up spare parts storage, and develop spare parts indicator charts to prevent temporary rushes from disrupting the operation plan. In addition, they must vigorously rectify the original records in order to accurately grasp the problems in production.
    【Xinhua News Agency, Baoding, May 27th】The state-owned Tangshan Steel Plant is rectifying its original records to strengthen the guidance and supervision of statistical work on production.
    Under the cooperation of the Statistics Bureau of the North China Administrative Committee and the Statistics Bureau of the Hebei Provincial People's Government, the Tangshan Steel Plant began rectifying its original records in late March and ended in early May. After this rectification, the departments corrected the past phenomenon of randomly issuing forms, initially achieving accurate and timely reports, providing scientific statistical data for the leadership, and also reducing some unnecessary burdens on the recorders.
    This rectification deleted 58 forms and reports that were repetitive or did not solve problems, and 232 indicators, from the original 457 original record forms and reports. It added 48 forms and reports that were urgently needed for production management, and 258 indicators. Taking the rolling mill workshop as an example, in the past, among the various forms and reports for recording the quality of steel, 23 items were repeated and 11 were unnecessary. However, the important indicator of steel ingot heating temperature, which is closely related to the quality of steel and the safe operation of the rolling mill, had never existed. This time, all of them were rationally added and deleted.
    After this rectification, the Tangshan Steel Plant has established a unified and centralized original record work system, which not only has dedicated personnel responsible for this work, but also each section and workshop has established contracts and established a data supply relationship.
    Before the start of this rectification work, the Tangshan Steel Plant, based on the different production processes of each workshop and the existing original record situation, first selected the steelmaking department and the rolling mill department as the focus of the rectification. After gaining experience, it continued to promote it in the foundry department, the refractory material department, and the electromechanical department. The rectification process is divided into four steps: First, go deep into the workshops, teams, and groups to listen to the opinions of the workers, understand the methods of filling out the original records, and collect the existing record forms and reports. Second, based on the principle of necessity and possibility, examine and sort out existing record forms, reports, and systems, and study and propose preliminary plans. Third, submit them to the workers for discussion and trial implementation, summarize them level by level, revise them, and then pass them through the factory management committee and announce them for implementation by the factory director. After these steps, the original records can more accurately reflect the production situation, and create favorable conditions for formal implementation.

### 鞍钢很多厂矿健全作业计划  唐山钢厂确定统一集中的原始纪录工作制度

    鞍钢很多厂矿健全作业计划
    唐山钢厂确定统一集中的原始纪录工作制度
    【本报讯】鞍山钢铁公司各厂矿讨论国家计划工作已接近结束。在讨论计划过程中，很多厂矿都以健全作业计划为中心加强计划管理工作，有的厂矿编制了作业计划方案，有的拟订了指示图表进行了重点试办。如中型轧钢厂在原来初步地实行的作业计划的基础上，经过总结和研究，将旬作业计划改为周作业计划，订出了检修计划和原材料管理制度，增加了矫正辊和燃料供应等指示图表。铸管厂在第一车间进行了作业计划的试点工作，经过一星期也初步取得了提高产量与质量的成果。机械总厂从五月份起增加了掌握生产总进度的指示图表和供料计划，消除了铸造与加工之间的脱节现象。
    但是，部分厂矿行动比较迟缓。这些厂矿的某些干部把讨论计划与建立作业计划对立起来看，把作业计划看得太难。个别单位的领导干部对这件工作没有大力支持，甚至把参加学习编制作业计划的同志调去做别的工作。也有个别单位不从实际问题出发，只是形式上做了些图表贴在工段，没有建立任何制度，结果很少小组按图表完成任务。
    为了克服上面的缺点，根据好的厂矿的经验，这些行动迟缓的厂矿首先应编好作业计划方案交群众贯彻实行，同时要加强调度制度，做到按作业计划进行调度，掌握全厂及各车间的生产情况，随时发现薄弱环节加以克服；做好检修计划，清理备品储存，制订备品指示图表，以防临时突击打乱作业计划；认真计算本单位的运输量，准确地制订月的运输计划以保证原材料供应与产品的运销。此外，还必须大力整顿原始纪录，以便准确地掌握着生产中的问题。
    【新华社保定二十七日电】国营唐山钢厂整顿原始纪录，以加强统计工作对生产的指导和监督作用。
    唐山钢厂在华北行政委员会统计局和河北省人民政府统计局合作下，三月下旬开始整顿原始纪录，到五月上旬结束。经过这次整顿以后，各部门纠正了过去乱发表格的现象，初步作到表报正确及时，给领导方面提供了科学的统计资料；同时也减轻了纪录员一些不必要的负担。
    这次整顿从原有的四百五十七个原始纪录表报中删掉了重复或不解决问题的表报五十八个，指标二百三十二个；增加了生产管理上迫切需要的表报四十八个，指标二百五十八个。以轧钢车间为例，过去关于记载钢的质量的各种表报中，项目重复的有二十三个，不必要的有十一个；但是和钢材质量、轧钢机安全运转有很大关系的钢锭加热温度的重要指标却从来没有。这次都作了合理的增删。
    经过这次整顿，唐山钢厂已确定了统一集中的原始纪录工作制度，不但有专人负责这个工作，而且各课和各车间都订立合同，建立了资料供应的关系。
    在这次整顿工作开始以前，唐山钢厂根据各车间不同的生产过程和已有的原始纪录情况，先选定炼钢部、轧钢部两车间作为整顿的重点，取得经验后，才继续在铸造部，耐火材料部和机电部推广。整顿过程分为四个步骤：第一、深入车间、班、组听取工人的意见，了解原始纪录的填报方法，搜集现有的纪录表报。第二、根据需要与可能的原则，审定和整理现有纪录表报和制度，研究提出初步方案。第三、交给工人讨论试行，逐级总结，加以修订，再在工厂管理委员会通过，由厂长公布施行。经过这些步骤以后，原始纪录可以做到更正确地反映生产情况，并且为正式推行时创造了有利条件。
