    Design and Construction Must Be Closely Integrated
    Luo Daotan, Director of the Northeast Electric Power Administration

    Design and construction are the two most closely related steps in basic construction work. The designs made by design units can only be realized through construction. Construction units, in order to carry out construction smoothly and meet the requirements of the design, must construct in accordance with the design. Therefore, the two must be closely linked and integrated. That is to say: the designs made by the design units must be of good quality so that the construction units can construct according to them; the construction units must fully understand the intentions of the design, help the design units to make accurate designs, and resolutely construct according to the design. Only in this way can basic construction work be done well.

    However, in past basic construction work, the phenomenon of design and construction not being well integrated was serious. In 1952, the Design Department of the Northeast Electric Power Administration sent site representatives to the construction sites to understand the situation and discovered many cases of construction units not constructing according to the design and designs not being in line with construction. Why couldn't the two sides be well integrated? After our research, we found the following reasons:

    First, construction personnel often satisfy themselves with "more construction experience" and "senior qualifications," and do not pay attention to the design. Although the leadership has repeatedly instructed to construct according to the design, many construction units have not seriously implemented it. For example, in the 19th project designed by the Design Department of the Northeast Electric Power Administration, before construction, the construction unit did not test the concrete according to the strength requirements in the design. By the time the main foundation of the factory building was completed, the concrete test blocks had only reached twenty-eight days. After testing, its strength was only three-quarters of the design requirements. Another example is the portal steel structure crossbeams in the 15th project, which were originally designed as single inclined members, but the construction unit made them all into double inclined members during construction. The site representative of the Design Department explained to them: "The strength of the single inclined member is sufficient; using double inclined members is a waste." The person in charge of the construction unit on the site said: "In the past, the Japanese designs all used double inclined members. Why are you designing single inclined members?" and said: "Don't save this bit of material. It doesn't look good this way either." Some construction units do not accept the advanced experience in the design. For example, after we learned the Soviet advanced method of calculating iron grounding, we changed all the grounding of the 15th, 16th, and 19th projects under construction to iron. However, the units constructing in the 15th and 16th projects did not accept this advanced experience. The construction personnel of the 15th project initially made excuses that there was not enough angle iron and were unwilling to change. When we pointed out that the existing waste angle iron was sufficient, they doubted the effectiveness of iron grounding and wanted to use only partial iron grounding. The construction personnel of the 16th project made excuses that they had old copper wire and did not want to change, failing to understand that promoting iron grounding could save a lot of copper.

    Second, the quality of the design is low, making it impossible for the construction unit to construct according to the design. The main reason why the design does not meet the needs of construction is that most designers have no construction experience, do not often go deep into reality to understand the situation, and have not established close contact with construction personnel. For example, the width between the foundation screws of a steel structure in the 19th project was calculated according to the entire angle iron during design. In fact, the angle iron was not entire but had joints, so the calculated width was shorter than the actual required width, making it impossible to install the steel structure on the foundation. There are many such examples.

    Third, the responsibilities of the construction, construction, and design units on the site are unclear, and a sound system has not been established. For example, when the construction unit has any opinions or requirements for the design, it should be submitted to the design unit through the construction unit, but some construction units often submit them directly to the design unit. The design, construction, and construction units should all have resident site representatives to clarify responsibilities, but in the past, the resident site representatives of the design unit often replaced the work of the construction unit or construction unit representatives. For example, in the early stage of the 19th project, the construction unit and the construction unit did not have inspection personnel to check the dimensions and steel bars of the beams, columns, and foundations, but the site representative of the Design Department did it. In this way, on the one hand, the site representative of the design unit replaced the work of the construction unit representative, and on the other hand, when non-conforming parts were found and the construction unit was required to modify them, the construction unit was unwilling to do so.

    Based on the above situation, in order to closely integrate design and construction, the following points must be achieved:

    1. Correct the view on design. The construction unit and the construction unit must deeply recognize that "without a correct design, construction cannot be carried out," and thoroughly change the idea that "construction can be carried out without a design." The construction unit must resolutely construct according to the design. The construction worker must check the construction work at any time and immediately correct any non-compliance with the design.

    2. The design unit must improve the quality of the design. Only when the quality of the design is improved can the construction unit construct according to the design. In order to eliminate the phenomenon of the design not being in line with construction, when designing, designers must often contact the construction unit and often go to the construction site to humbly accept the opinions of construction personnel.

    3. Clarify the responsibilities of the construction, construction, and design units on the construction site and establish a system. The regulations on contracting have already stipulated the relationship between the construction unit and the construction unit. The following only discusses the responsibilities that the site representative of the design unit should bear.

    (1) Explain the various designs and construction instructions. In order for the construction to meet the design, it is necessary to make the construction workers thoroughly understand the intentions of the designer. According to the experience of Soviet experts at a certain construction site, the site representative of the design unit should, before the start of each work (one month or half a month), explain in detail to the cadres of the construction and construction units the conditions and requirements of the original project design, the technical specifications of the construction, the operation methods, and the technical specifications or requirements to be achieved when the construction is completed and put into operation, so that the construction workers can have a full understanding. Before construction, if the construction unit still has any questions or difficulties, they can be raised for joint research and resolution; after the two parties reach an agreement, the construction unit should resolutely construct according to the regulations. To achieve this, the construction unit must have a detailed construction plan in advance. At the same time, the cadres of the construction unit must convey the requirements, specifications, and operating methods of the project to the workers so that every worker understands them.

    (2) Modify the design on the site. There are three main reasons: the equipment used for construction has changed; a more advanced construction method has been discovered; and there are errors in the original design. If the equipment has changed, the design must be modified. If a more advanced method than the original design is found, it must also be modified; this modification often causes trouble for the construction unit, but in order to improve the work, it must be insisted on. As for modifying due to design errors, it should be avoided as much as possible. According to Soviet experts, the amount of design modification on the site accounts for about 5% to 6% of the total design in restoration and expansion projects, and about 1% in new construction projects. These are all experiences that are worth our good research and study.

    (3) When the representative of the design unit finds that the construction and design are not in conformity, he must put forward his opinions to the construction unit through the construction unit. This work should be distinguished from the work of the inspectors of the construction unit and the construction unit; otherwise, the design unit will easily replace the work of the inspectors of the construction unit or the construction unit. The construction unit should humbly accept the inspection of the design unit and strive to correct the shortcomings in the work.

    设计和施工必须密切结合
    东北电业管理局局长  罗道坦
    设计和施工，是基本建设工作中关系最密切的两个步骤。设计单位做出的设计，经过施工才能实现。施工单位要想顺利地进行施工，达到设计的要求，必须依照设计施工。因此，两者必须密切联系，互相结合。就是说：设计单位做出的设计，质量一定要好，使施工单位能够按照它进行施工；施工单位必须充分了解设计的意图，帮助设计单位做出精确的设计，而且坚决按照设计施工。只有这样，基本建设工作才能做好。
    但是，在过去的基本建设工作中，设计和施工不能很好结合的现象是严重存在的。东北电业管理局设计处，一九五二年派遣了工地代表到工地了解情况，就发现了许多施工单位不按照设计施工和设计不切合施工的情况。双方面为什么不能很好结合呢？经我们研究，找出了以下几个原因：
    第一，施工人员往往满足自己“施工的经验多”、
    “资格老”，不重视设计。领导方面虽曾屡次指示依照设计施工，但许多施工单位都未认真实行。例如：东北电业管理局设计处设计的十九号工程，在施工前，施工单位就没有把混凝土依照设计上的要求强度作好试验，等厂房本体基础工程已完成时，混凝土试块才到二十八天，经试验，它的强度仅为设计要求的四分之三。又如十五号工程中门型铁构横梁，原设计的是单斜材，施工单位在施工时都做成双斜材。设计处工地代表向他们解释说：“单斜材强度已够，用双斜材是浪费。”建设单位工地负责人却说：“过去日本人设计的都是用双斜材，为什么你们设计单斜材？”并说：“不要省这点材料，这样，也不好看。”有些施工单位，不接受设计中的先进经验。如我们学习了苏联先进的铁接地计算方法以后，就把正在施工中的十五、十六、十九号工程的接地，全部改为铁质。但是，在十五、十六两工程中施工的单位，都不接受这个先进经验。十五号工程施工人员，开始借口没有足够的三角铁，不愿改。当我们指出现有的废料三角铁已够用时，他们又怀疑铁接地的效能，想只用部分铁接地。十六号工程施工人员，则借口有旧铜线，不想改，而不了解推行铁接地，可以节约很多铜。
    第二，设计的质量低，使施工单位不能按照设计施工。设计不切合施工需要的主要原因是：大多数设计人员没有施工经验，而又没有经常深入实际了解情况，也没有和施工人员建立密切联系。例如十九号工程中一个铁构的基础螺丝间的宽度，设计时是照整根三角铁算出的，实际上三角铁不是整根的，而是有接头的，因而算出的宽度比实际需要的宽度短，以致铁构装不到基础上去。这样的例子是很多的。
    第三，工地上的建设、施工、设计三个单位，职责不明，没有建立起健全的制度。如施工单位对设计有什么意见和要求时，应通过建设单位向设计单位提出，但有些施工单位往往直接向设计单位提出。设计、建设、施工三个单位，应都有驻工地代表，分清责任，但过去设计单位的驻工地代表，往往代替了建设单位或施工单位代表的工作。如在十九号工程开工初期，建设单位和施工单位就没有检查人员去核对梁、柱、基础的尺寸和钢筋，而由设计处工地代表去作。这样，一方面，设计单位的工地代表，代替了施工单位代表的工作，另一方面当检查出有不合格处要施工单位修改时，施工单位又不愿意执行。
    根据上面的情况，要使设计和施工密切结合，必须做到以下几点：
    一、端正对设计的看法。建设单位和施工单位，必须要深刻认识“没有正确的设计便不能施工”，彻底转变“没有设计亦可以施工”的思想。施工单
    位要做到坚决依照设计施工。施工员要随时随地检
    查施工工作，发现有不合设计的，立即纠正。
    二、设计单位要提高设计质量。只有设计的质量提高，施工单位才能按照设计施工。为了消灭设计不切合施工的现象，在进行设计时，设计人员必须要经常和施工单位联系，并要经常到施工现场，虚心接受施工人员的意见。
    三、明确施工现场建设、施工、设计三个单位的责任，建立制度。关于建设单位和施工单位的关系，包工条例上已有规定，下面只谈谈设计单位的工地代表应负那些责任。
    （一）解释各项设计及施工说明。要想施工合乎设计，必须使施工工作者彻底了解设计者的意图。根据苏联专家在某工地的经验，设计单位的工地代表，应在每一工作开始前（一个月或半个月），对施工、建设单位的干部，详细解释工程原设计的条件和要求、施工时技术规范、操作方法、施工完竣后运转时要达到的技术规格或要求等，使施工者能有充分的了解。在施工前，施工单位如还有什么疑问和困难，可提出共同研究解决；当双方意见一致后，施工单位应坚决依照规定施工。要做到这样，施工单位事先必须要有周密的施工计划。同时施工单位的干部，必须要把工程的要求、规格、操作方法等向工人传达，使每个工人都了解。
    （二）在现场修改设计，主要的原因有三种：施工用的器材变更了；发现另有先进的施工方法；原设计上有错误。如果器材变更了，必须修改设计。如果发现有比原设计先进的方法，也必须修改；这种修改，常常会使施工单位增加麻烦，但为了改善工作，必须坚持修改。至于因设计错误而修改，是应该尽量避免的。据苏联专家谈：在现场修改设计的分量，在恢复和扩充工程中，约占全部设计的百分之五至百分之六，在新建工程中，约占百分之一。这都是值得我们很好研究学习的经验。
    （三）发现施工和设计有不符合时，设计单位的代表必须要通过建设单位，对施工单位提出意见。这个工作，应和建设单位、施工单位的检查员工作分清，否则，设计单位容易代替建设单位或施工单位检查员的工作。施工单位应虚心接受设计单位的检查，努力改正工作中的缺点。
