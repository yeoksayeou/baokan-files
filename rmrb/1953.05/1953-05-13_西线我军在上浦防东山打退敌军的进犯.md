Xinhua News Agency, Korean Front, 12th: From May 6th to 10th, the number of enemy attacks on the positions of the Korean and Chinese People's forces increased compared to the previous period.

On the 8th, on the Western Front, our troops at Shangpu defending Dongshan – that is, what the enemy calls "Old Baldy Mountain" – repelled an attack by a reinforced company of the U.S. 7th Division. This was the first incursion by the U.S. 7th Division since suffering over 1,000 casualties here more than three months ago. At about 11 o'clock that night, more than 200 U.S. soldiers sneaked up to within 50 meters of our positions. At this moment, a large number of shells fired by our troops suddenly landed among them, and the enemy was thrown into chaos and completely routed. An hour later, under the cover of artillery fire, the enemy launched another attack but was again repelled by our army's fierce artillery fire. In this battle, the enemy suffered more than 120 casualties, while our army suffered only two wounded and one killed. On the 9th, on the Eastern Front, our troops near Dafanggu, southwest of Changcheng-ri, repelled two incursions by a company of the Li Pseudo-Army 12th Division, killing or wounding more than 60 enemy soldiers in total.

During these five days, our army also annihilated more than 200 enemy soldiers in raiding battles. On the night of the 8th, our army launched attacks on three enemy positions near Jinhua and northwest of Tieyuan, annihilating two entire platoons and most of another platoon of the Li Pseudo-Army.

During these five days, our army's mobile artillery fire at the front killed or wounded a total of 723 enemy soldiers; front-line anti-aircraft artillery units shot down two enemy planes and damaged nine.

    西线我军在上浦防东山打退敌军的进犯
    【新华社朝鲜前线十二日电】五月六日到十日五天中，敌军向朝中人民部队阵地的攻击次数较前增多。
    八日，西线我军在上浦防东山——即敌人所称的“老秃山”上，击退了美军第七师的一个加强连的攻击。这是美军第七师三个多月前在这里伤亡一千多人以后的第一次进犯。这天夜里十一时许，美军二百多人偷偷摸摸地进到离我军阵地五十公尺的地方。这时，我军发射的大量炮弹突然落在他们中间，敌人被打的乱作一团，全部溃退下去。一小时后，敌人在炮火掩护下再次发动攻击，但又被我军猛烈的炮火击退。这次战斗中，敌军死伤一百二十多名，我军仅二人负伤，一人牺牲。九日，东线我军在长承里西南大房谷附近击退李伪军第十二师一个连的两次进犯，共毙伤敌军六十多名。
    这五天中，我军在袭击战斗中也歼灭了二百多名敌人。八日夜间，我军先后向金化附近和铁原西北的三处敌军阵地进行攻击，歼灭了李伪军两个整排和一个排大部。
    这五天中，我军前线游动炮火共击毙击伤敌军七百二十三名；前线高射炮部队击落敌机两架，击伤九架。
