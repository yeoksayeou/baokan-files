Newspapers Should Actively Mobilize the Masses to Discuss Production Plans and Strengthen Planning Management

    Mobilizing the masses of workers to discuss production plans and strengthen planning management is the foundation for improving enterprise management, an important method for ensuring the comprehensive completion of state plans, and a major component of the current struggle against bureaucracy within enterprises, combined with production. In our newspaper propaganda, especially in the newspaper propaganda in industrial and mining areas, we should pay attention to how to grasp this key issue, use typical comparison methods, and systematically publicize the significance of mobilizing workers to discuss plans and strengthen planning management for national construction, as well as how to combine the anti-bureaucracy struggle, mobilize the masses to discuss plans, and do a good job in planning management.

    In order to complete this reporting task, in the past five months, some newspapers have made considerable efforts in mobilizing the masses to discuss plans. Among them, the Northeast Daily and the Tianjin Daily have been particularly effective. According to the progress of objective work, the Northeast Daily has grasped three key links and made relatively prominent reports. The first link is to lay an ideological foundation for mobilizing the masses to discuss plans by combining it with the propaganda of the three major tasks. In the first quarter of this year, the Northeast Daily not only focused on introducing the advanced experience of the No. 53 Factory and the Shenyang Smelting Plant in using the education of the three major tasks to mobilize the masses to discuss plans, and the bad example of the Shenyang Machinery No. 1 Factory in conservatively formulating production plans, but also systematically criticized the erroneous ideas among many factory and mine cadres, such as "basic construction is the most important, and the significance of production is reduced." Through the comparative education of these typical cases and ideological criticism, it not only deepened the propaganda of the three major tasks, stimulated the political enthusiasm of the workers, and set off a wave of finding tricks and tapping potential, but also corrected the workers' understanding of industrial production and production plans. After repeated publicity by the newspapers, the broad masses of workers have begun to realize that completing the state production plan is related to the speed of national industrialization, and to ensure the completion of the production plan, it is necessary to mobilize the masses to discuss the plan and strengthen planning management. The second link is to report on the experience of reviewing plans, signing collective contracts, and launching production competitions. For example, the newspaper's reports on April 12th and 24th on the Northeast No. 1 Cement Plant correcting formalism through reviewing plans, and the Shenyang Smelting Plant signing collective contracts to launch competitions, were accompanied by commentaries emphasizing the correct methods of reviewing plans and signing contracts. The third link is that after the masses were mobilized, the Northeast Daily began in April to vigorously expose the typical cases of bureaucracy and false reports in the Fushun Machinery Repair Factory, the Fushun Transportation Undertaking Office, and the Rubber No. 5 Factory, in combination with the anti-bureaucracy struggle; and systematically introduced the experience of Fushun City in combining the anti-bureaucracy struggle, using in-depth investigation and research methods to carefully check and discuss production plans. This experience pointed out that the correct method of mobilizing the masses to discuss plans is to conduct investigation and research from top to bottom, put forward requirements, point out key points, explain methods, and then mobilize the masses from bottom to top for discussion. Because the biggest shortcomings of the leading cadres of factories and mines are that they do not understand the situation, do not conduct research, and have no idea what to do. In view of this situation, the Northeast Daily on the one hand focused on criticizing the old-fashioned practices of being conservative and complacent and making a lot of noise from bottom to top and then finishing the work, and on the other hand vigorously publicized the practice of combining the anti-bureaucracy struggle, conducting in-depth investigation and research, discovering problems, finding key points, deeply mobilizing the masses, and conducting discussions to formulate correct plans. Bureaucracy and making false reports are manifestations of conservative and backward thinking and capitalist management thinking. It is an enemy that hinders mass discussion of plans and the establishment of planning management. Therefore, the Northeast Daily's focus on opposing bureaucracy and false reports as the central content of mobilizing the masses to discuss production plans is undoubtedly completely correct. In this regard, the Tianjin Daily's report is more focused, powerful, and systematic. After the Tianjin Daily proposed in an editorial on February 28 that "In formulating plans, we must pay attention to overcoming bad phenomena such as falsehood, concealment, arrogance, complacency, and bureaucracy," it opened a special column of "Exposing False Phenomena and Opposing Bureaucracy," and successively exposed many bad phenomena such as factories and mines engaging in fraud. In this report, the Tianjin Daily not only generally paid attention to the effect of exposure and criticism, but also paid attention to reporting the attitude to be taken towards the anti-falsehood struggle. For example, the reports on the state-owned No. 2 Cotton Textile Factory perfunctorily dealing with matters, and the Tianjin Rubber Factory's branch mobilizing workers to conduct an anti-falsehood struggle in conjunction with the revision of the plan, are prominent examples of pushing the struggle in-depth and enlightening workers in various factories to actively discuss and revise the plan. Some factories, such as Hengda Tobacco Factory, after an anti-falsehood struggle, reduced the waste rate from 4.55% to no more than 3.9%.

    The main reason why the Northeast Daily and the Tianjin Daily have achieved the above-mentioned achievements is that they value the newspaper as a weapon for mobilizing the masses to discuss plans and complete plans. Of course, the Northeast Daily and the Tianjin Daily also have some shortcomings in their reports on mobilizing the masses to discuss plans. In the work summary of the first quarter, the editorial department of the Northeast Daily pointed out that its main shortcomings are: it did not criticize and urge improvement in a timely manner in response to the poor completion of production plans in various factories and mines in Northeast China; and it did not give due attention to important issues such as trial production of new products and ensuring the supply of processing orders for basic construction to support basic construction. The main shortcoming of the Tianjin Daily is that in the reports on revising production plans and organizing technical measures plans, it did not clearly and timely guide the transition to establishing and improving the planning management system, in order to gradually achieve balanced production. In order to overcome these shortcomings and improve the reporting level, the Northeast Daily and the Tianjin Daily have recently conducted summaries. The Northeast Daily is also preparing to start from the following key issues on the basis of mobilizing the masses to discuss plans, and report on how to strengthen planning management. First, in the reports on continuing to deepen the discussion of the plan, emphasize the conduct of scientific investigation and research, and emphasize the practice of investigating and researching while solving problems. The specific requirements for discussing the plan are: find advanced quotas, formulate specific work plans, and organize balanced production. Second, in the reports on mobilizing the masses for competition, the main requirement is to implement contracts and complete or over fulfill the state plan for the second quarter. In order to achieve this requirement, it is decided to focus on reporting on the promotion of advanced experience and the organization of rhythmic production, which are two fundamental issues in planning management. Third, in the reports on strengthening planning management, it is also planned to focus on reporting on strengthening the political work of technical personnel and staff, as well as strengthening the supervisory and guaranteeing role of the Party committee. Because this is an important part of realizing planning management. If this work is not strengthened, planning management will be difficult to realize. Therefore, the focus of this report is to strengthen the education of technical personnel and staff, criticize and correct their backward phenomena in this regard; second, to publicize the correct practices of technical personnel and staff going deep into the workshops, discovering problems, and solving problems, and encourage them to continue to move forward; and third, to introduce the typical experience of the Party committee often going deep into the grassroots to inspect, educate cadres, improve enterprise management, and ensure the completion of tasks.

    Although the Northeast Daily's approach to reporting on in-depth discussion of plans and strengthening planning management still needs future practice and efforts, it provides a direction for the effort to in-depth discussion of plans and strengthen planning management. Especially at present, the work of mobilizing the masses in factories and mines in various places to discuss plans and strengthen planning management is still developing very unevenly. Taking the factories and mines under the Central Ministry of Heavy Industry as an example, except for most of the factories and mines in the Northeast and North China regions, which are ending the discussion of production plans and transitioning to strengthening planning management, some of the factories and mines in the Southwest region have not yet mobilized the masses to fully discuss the various annual plan targets, and the factories and mines in the East China region did not arrange it until April because of the wage review, while the factories and mines in the Central South region have only recently begun preparations for discussing the plan. In addition, there are still many factories and mines that cannot fully complete the state plan or cannot organize balanced production. This situation requires our newspapers to vigorously disseminate and promote the advanced experience of mobilizing the masses to discuss plans and strengthen planning management, and fully exert the fighting role of newspapers in completing the state production plan.

    报纸要积极发动群众讨论生产计划和加强计划管理
    发动职工群众讨论生产计划、加强计划管理工作，是改进企业管理的基础，是保证全面完成国家计划的重要方法，也是当前在企业内部结合生产进行反对官僚主义斗争的一项主要内容。我们在报纸宣传上，特别是在工矿地区的报纸宣传上，就应注意如何抓住这个关键问题，以典型对比的方法，系统地宣传发动职工讨论计划和加强计划管理对国家建设的意义，以及如何结合反官僚主义斗争，发动群众讨论计划，作好计划管理工作。
    为了完成这一报道任务，近五个月来，有些报纸在发动群众讨论计划方面，曾作了不少的努力。其中尤以东北日报、天津日报作得较有成效。东北日报根据客观工作的进程，曾抓住三个环节，作了比较突出的报道。第一个环节是，结合三大任务的宣传，为发动群众讨论计划打下思想基础。在今年第一季度，东北日报不仅以典型对比的方法，着重介绍了五三工厂、沈阳冶炼厂等单位以三大任务教育发动群众讨论计划的先进经验，和沈阳机械一厂生产计划订得保守的坏典型；并系统地批判了许多厂矿干部中“基本建设第一了，生产的重要意义减轻了”等错误思想。通过这些典型事例的对比教育和思想批判，既深入了三大任务的宣传，启发了职工的政治积极性，掀起找窍门、挖潜力的热潮，又端正了职工对工业生产和生产计划的认识。广大职工群众经过报纸的反复宣传，已经开始认识到：完成国家生产计划，是关系着国家工业化的速度问题，而要保证生产计划的完成，又必须发动群众讨论计划和加强计划管理工作。第二个环节是，报道了复查计划、订立集体合同，发动生产竞赛的经验。例如，该报在四月十二日、二十四日对于东北第一水泥厂经过复查计划纠正形式主义，和沈阳冶炼厂签订集体合同展开竞赛的报道，就曾配合评论着重说明复查计划、订立合同的正确作法。第三个环节是，在群众发动起来后，东北日报又从四月份开始结合反官僚主义斗争，大力揭发了抚顺机械修理厂、抚顺运输事业所、橡胶五厂等单位的官僚主义和假报告的典型事例；并系统地介绍了抚顺市结合反官僚主义斗争，以深入调查研究的方法，认真检查、讨论生产计划的经验。这个经验指明，正确发动群众讨论计划的方法，是自上而下调查研究、提出要求、指明关键、交代作法，然后再自下而上地发动群众进行讨论。因为各厂矿领导干部中最大的缺点，是不了解情况，不进行研究，心中无数。根据这种情况，东北日报一方面着重批判了保守自满和自下而上轰一阵就完事的老一套作法，一方面大力宣传了结合反官僚主义斗争，深入调查研究、发现问题、找关键、深入发动群众、进行讨论制订正确计划的作法。官僚主义和做假报告是保守落后的思想和资本主义经营思想的表现，它是阻碍群众讨论计划和建立计划管理的敌人，因而东北日报把反对官僚主义、反对假报告作为发动群众讨论生产计划报道的中心内容，无疑是完全正确的。在这一点上，天津日报的报道作得更为集中有力、更有系统。天津日报从二月二十八日在社论中提出：“在制订计划中，必须注意克服虚假隐瞒、骄傲自满以及官僚主义等恶劣现象”后，即辟了“揭发虚假现象、反对官僚主义”的专栏，连续揭发了不少厂矿弄虚作假等恶劣现象。天津日报在这一报道中，不仅一般地注意了揭发和批评的效果，还注意报道了以什么态度来对待反虚假斗争。例如对国营第二棉纺织厂敷衍塞责，和天津橡胶厂支部发动职工结合修订计划进行反虚假斗争的报道，就是把斗争推向深入、并启发各厂职工积极讨论和修订计划的显著例子。有些工厂如恒大烟草厂在经过反虚假斗争后，并把废次品率由百分之四点五五，降低到不超过百分之三点九。
    东北日报、天津日报所以能取得上述成绩，主要原因之一，就是他们看重了把报纸作为发动群众讨论计划和完成计划的武器。当然，东北日报、天津日报在发动群众讨论计划的报道中，也还存在着一些缺点。东北日报编辑部在第一季度工作总结中，就曾指出其主要缺点是：没有同时针对东北各厂矿生产计划完成不好的情况，及时进行批评，督促改进；而对试制新产品，以及保证基本建设加工订货的供应等支援基本建设的重要问题，也没有给予应有的重视。天津日报的主要缺点则是：在修订生产计划和组织技术措施计划的报道中，没有明确地及时地引导转入建立和健全计划管理制度，以逐步达到均衡地进行生产。为克服这些缺点，并把报道水平提高一步，东北日报、天津日报都在最近进行了总结。东北日报并准备在发动群众讨论计划的基础上，从以下几个关键问题入手，报道关于如何加强计划管理的工作。即：第一，在继续深入讨论计划的报道中，强调进行科学的调查研究，强调一面调查研究一面解决问题的作法。对讨论计划的具体要求是：找出先进的定额，制订具体的作业计划，组织均衡生产。第二，在发动群众竞赛的报道中，主要的要求是实现合同，完成或超额完成第二季度的国家计划。为达到这个要求，并决定着重报道推广先进经验和组织有节奏生产，这是计划管理中的两个根本问题。第三，在加强计划管理的报道中，还准备着重报道加强技术人员与职员的政治工作，以及加强党委的监督保证作用。因为这是实现计划管理中一个重要的部分。如果不加强这一工作，计划管理是很难实现的。因此，这一报道的重点，一是加强对技术人员和职员的教育，批评改正他们在这一面的落后现象；二是宣传技术人员和职员深入车间、发现问题、解决问题的正确作法，鼓励他们继续前进；三是介绍党委经常深入基层检查、教育干部、提高企业管理水平、保证完成任务的典型经验。
    东北日报关于报道深入讨论计划加强计划管理的这个作法，虽还有待于今后的实践和努力，但它却为深入讨论计划加强计划管理的报道提供了一个努力方向。特别是目前各地厂矿发动群众讨论计划加强计划管理工作，还发展得很不平衡。以中央重工业部所属厂矿为例，除东北、华北地区大部厂矿，正在结束讨论生产计划转入加强计划管理工作外，西南地区一部分厂矿，对全年各项计划指标还没有发动群众全面进行讨论，华东地区的厂矿因为进行工资复查，直到四月间才布置下去，中南地区的厂矿则是最近才开始进行讨论计划的准备工作。此外，还有不少厂矿不能全面完成国家计划，或不能组织均衡生产。这种情况，就更加要求我们的报纸，大力传播和推广发动群众讨论计划加强计划管理的先进经验，充分发挥报纸在完成国家生产计划中的战斗作用。
