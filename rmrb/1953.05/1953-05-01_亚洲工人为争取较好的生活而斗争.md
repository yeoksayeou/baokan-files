Hundreds of millions of Asian people in the Soviet Union, People's China, and the Mongolian People's Republic, having been liberated from the oppression and exploitation of feudal forces and imperialism, will celebrate May Day with a feeling of looking forward to a prosperous and happy future, but hundreds of millions of other Asian people are still living a tragic life of poverty, disease, and national oppression.

For centuries, the people of the beautiful land of Asia have suffered the plunder of British, French, Dutch, Portuguese, and American imperialists. Exploitation by foreign capitalists is nothing new to them.

But today, as Comrade Stalin said, the basic economic law of modern capitalism is "to secure the maximum of capitalist profit through the exploitation, ruin and impoverishment of the majority of the population of the given country, through the enslavement and systematic robbery of the peoples of other countries, especially backward countries, and, lastly, through wars and militarization of the national economy, which are utilized for the obtaining of the highest profits."

Therefore, the imperialist plunderers have become more and more insatiable. They are no longer satisfied with the average profits and super-profits they previously extracted from colonial and semi-colonial countries.

For the great monopoly capital that manipulates the economic life of the capitalist world, only the absolute maximum profit can satisfy them today.

As the British imperialists admit, the plunder of the colonies is becoming more and more cruel. They boast that Malaya earns them more dollars today than all of Britain's exports.

No example illustrates the enslavement and continuous plunder of other countries better than that of Japan, which has lost its independence as a country and is under the rule of the United States. As a result of the double exploitation by the Japanese big bourgeoisie and American monopoly capital, the already low living standards of the vast majority of the Japanese people before World War II are even lower today.

Although the rising tide of the struggle for national independence has forced the European imperialists to change their tactics in countries such as India and Indonesia, granting them some nominal national independence, the lifeline of the national economies of these countries is still in the hands of the British and Dutch imperialists, who continue to extract huge profits from the people of India and Indonesia.

There are many such examples. The British-owned Baradighi Tea Garden in West Bengal, with an investment of 500,000 rupees, has made nearly 3 million rupees in net profits in the last decade, six times the original investment! The British-owned Calcutta Tramways Company has also raked in 5.5 million pounds in profits since 1906, while the original capital was only 350,000 pounds.

Dutch monopoly capitalists still own almost all the rubber plantations in Indonesia, and they are extracting even greater profits than before from the plunder of Indonesian land and people. In addition, we should consider the growing influence of American and British intrusion into Indonesia's economy, with the result that the imperialist exploitation of Indonesia is even more brutal than when it was directly under Dutch rule.

The heavy burden of imperialist exploitation weighs particularly heavily on the workers. In colonial and semi-colonial countries, their living standards are often on the starvation line.

Last year, due to American manipulation of the market, the price of rubber, which had been making huge profits for many years, fell, and the Malayan rubber plantation owners ruthlessly cut the already meager wages of the rubber plantation workers. In reality, their profits are still very large.

This year, the British tea garden owners in India and Ceylon did the same thing, reducing wages due to the fall in tea prices.

In all the Asian countries that have not yet been liberated, we see the same picture: the living standards of the masses are declining year by year, famines and floods occur frequently, and unemployment and disease are constantly increasing.

But the days of the imperialists in Asia are numbered. This is not only because hundreds of millions of people have been liberated, but also because the rest of the Asian people are waging a heroic struggle for their freedom and a better life. Standing at the forefront of this struggle is the working class.

The heroic struggle of the suffering Korean people is greatly supported by the self-sacrificing efforts of the Korean workers, who insist on production and guarantee the supply of transportation to the front.

The current irresistible victory of the People's Armies of Vietnam and Laos would not be possible without the hard work and creativity of the workers who repair weapons in factories in the primeval forests. The weapons they manufacture and repair have repeatedly defeated the French army, which possesses modern American weapons and aircraft.

The Japanese workers have not succumbed to the oppression and terror of the United States and Yoshida; they are waging a great struggle not only for wages but also for the independence of their motherland, for peace, and for friendly relations with the Chinese people. The divisions within the Japanese working class are rapidly disappearing, and a powerful united front is taking shape.

The recent results of the Japanese general election show that Japanese workers and trade unions are now a powerful force that is enough to frighten the Americans and their despicable Japanese puppets like Yoshida.

Under the leadership of the All-Indonesia Central Organization of Trade Unions (SOBSI) – the largest trade union organization in Indonesia, supported by the vast majority of Indonesian workers – Indonesian workers are fighting for genuine national independence from Dutch and American imperialism, and even the most vicious means of terror have not been able to destroy SOBSI's organization.

Indian workers cannot tolerate the semi-colonial status of their country, the continued imperialist plunder of India's wealth, and the terrible conditions of their lives.

Despite the fact that the West Bengal provincial government has signed an agreement with the British-owned Calcutta Tramways Company, allowing it to continue to extract profits from the Indian people for another twenty years and then sell the company at a price ten times higher than the original investment, Indian workers are demanding the immediate confiscation of the company. At the same time, workers have recently won a victory in their long struggle for wage increases.

Workers in India and Ceylon are fighting back against attempts to further lower their living standards.

Recently, workers at the above-mentioned Baradighi Tea Garden were shot by police during a march, resulting in one worker being killed and seven seriously injured, but the workers' fighting spirit was not affected.

Thousands of Ceylon tea garden workers are on strike against wage cuts.

Tens of thousands of dockworkers in Singapore, despite the prevailing inhuman terror, recently persisted in a strike and achieved partial victory.

The workers of Asia have had enough of the brutal terror and barbaric exploitation of imperialist rule. In Korea, Vietnam, Malaya, and the Philippines, they are engaged in armed struggle; elsewhere, even without arms, there is great courage everywhere.

Inspired by the glorious examples of Soviet Asia and New China – where the workers have stood up and eliminated unemployment, hunger, and national oppression – the workers in other parts of Asia will wage a more determined struggle for a better life this May Day.

This May Day, the minds of millions of oppressed people will be turned toward the grand celebrations of peace and victory held by workers in Beijing and other cities in China.

Eisenhower's inhuman slogan of "Asians fighting Asians" does not resonate well in the heart of any Asian worker.

This May Day, the working class of the world will strengthen international ties in the spirit of Karl Marx's immortal saying:

"Workers of all countries, unite!" "The proletarians have nothing to lose in this revolution but their chains. They have a world to win."

### 亚洲工人为争取较好的生活而斗争

    亚洲工人为争取较好的生活而斗争
    世界工联亚澳联络局委员　桑顿
    苏联、人民中国和蒙古人民共和国的数亿的亚洲人民已经从封建势力和帝国主义的压迫与剥削下获得了解放，将以瞻望着繁荣幸福的将来的心情庆祝
    “五一”节，但是好几亿其他的亚洲人民仍然在过着贫困、疾病与民族压迫的悲惨生活。
    亚洲的美好土地上的人民多少世纪以来就遭受着英国、法国、荷兰、葡萄牙和美国帝国主义者的掠夺。受外国资本家的剥削，对于他们已不是什么新的经验了。
    但是今天，正如斯大林同志所说的，现代资本主义的基本经济法则是“用剥削本国大多数居民并使他们破产和贫困的办法，用奴役和不断掠夺其他国家人民、特别是落后国家人民的办法，以及用旨在保证最高利润的战争和国民经济军事化的办法，来保证最大限度的资本主义利润。”
    因此帝国主义掠夺者变得愈来愈贪得无厌了，他们已不满足于以前从殖民地和半殖民地国家榨取的平均利润和超额利润。
    对于操纵着资本主义世界经济生活的大垄断资本，今天只有绝对的最大限度利润才能使他们心满意足。
    正如英国帝国主义者所承认的，对殖民地的掠夺一天比一天残酷，他们夸耀说：马来亚今天给他们赚来的美元比英国全部输出所得到的还要多。
    对其他国家人民的奴役和不断掠夺，没有比日本的例子更能说明的了。日本已丧失了作为一个国家的独立地位，而处于美国的统治之下。由于日本大资产阶级和美国垄断资本的双重剥削的结果，日本广大人民在第二次世界大战前已经很低的生活水平，今天更加低下。
    虽然争取民族独立斗争浪潮的日益高涨，迫使欧洲帝国主义者在像印度和印度尼西亚等国家中改变策略，给予它们形式上的某些民族独立，然而这些国家的国民经济的命脉依然操在英国和荷兰帝国主义者的手中，他们继续从印度和印度尼西亚人民的身上攫取巨额的利润。
    这样的例子是很多的。西孟加拉的英国人所有的巴拉地吉茶园，所投的资本是五十万卢比，而在最近十年中竟取得了将近三百万卢比的纯利润，六倍于所投的资本！英国人所有的加尔各答电车公司从一九○六年以来也搜刮了五百五十万镑的利润，而原来的资本只不过三十五万镑。
    荷兰垄断资本家在印度尼西亚仍然占有差不多所有的橡胶园，他们从对印度尼西亚的土地和人民的掠夺中攫取着比以前任何时候都大的利润。除此以外，还应该想到美国和英国侵入印度尼西亚经济的势力的日益增长，结果是帝国主义者对印度尼西亚的榨取比它直接在荷兰统治下的时候还要残酷。
    帝国主义剥削的重压，特别沉重地加在工人的身上。在殖民地与半殖民地国家中，他们的生活水平经常是在饥饿线上的。
    去年，由于美国对市场的操纵，多年来获得暴利的橡胶的价格下跌，马来亚的橡胶园主便无情地削减橡胶园工人本来就已很可怜的工资。实际上他们的利润仍然是很大的。
    今年英国在印度和锡兰的茶园园主也干了同样的事情，由于茶价的下跌，便减少工资。
    在所有还未解放的亚洲国家中，我们看到同样一种景象：群众的生活水平逐年降低，饥荒与水灾经常发生，失业和疾病不断增加。
    但是帝国主义者在亚洲的日子已是屈指可数的了。这不仅是因为数亿人民已经获得了解放，而且其余的亚洲人民正在为争取他们的自由与较好的生活而进行英勇的斗争。站在这个斗争的前列的是工人阶级。
    受难的朝鲜人民的英勇斗争得到朝鲜工人自我牺牲的努力的极大支持。他们坚持生产，并保证了供应前方的运输。
    越南与寮国人民军队目前的势不可挡的胜利，如果没有那些在原始丛林中的工厂里修造武器的工人的坚苦劳动和创造性，也是不可能获得的。他们所制造和修理好的武器，一次又一次地把拥有新式美国武器与飞机的法国军队打败。
    日本工人并没有向美国和吉田的压迫和恐怖手段屈服，他们不仅是为了争取工资而且为了争取祖国的独立，争取和平以及和中国人民的友好关系而进行着伟大的斗争。日本工人阶级的分裂现象正在迅速地消失，一个强大的统一战线正在形成。
    最近日本大选的结果显示，日本工人与工会现在已是一支足以使美国人和他们的像吉田一类卑鄙的日本傀儡惊恐的强大力量了。
    在印尼总工会——被极大多数印尼工人所支持的印尼最大的工会组织——的领导之下，印尼工人正在进行向荷美帝国主义争取真正民族独立的斗争，甚至最狠毒的恐怖手段也没有能够摧毁印尼总工会的组织。
    印度工人不能容忍他们国家的半殖民地的地位，不能容忍帝国主义对印度财富的继续掠夺和他们生活的可怕状况。
    尽管西孟加拉省政府已和英国人所有的加尔各答电车公司签订了协议，允许它再继续从印度人民身上榨取二十年的利润，然后再以比原来的投资额高十倍的价格把公司出售，印度工人却要求立即没收这个公司。同时，工人们最近在争取增加工资的长期斗争中取得了胜利。
    印度和锡兰的工人正在对进一步降低他们生活水平的图谋进行反击。
    最近，上面提到过的巴拉地吉茶园的工人，在举行游行时曾遭警察的枪击，结果一个工人被杀，七人受重伤，但是工人们的斗争精神却并未受到影响。
    成千的锡兰茶园的工人正在进行反对降低工资的罢工。
    新加坡的上万的码头工人，不顾盛行的惨无人道的恐怖手段，最近坚持了罢工，并且取得了部分的胜利。
    亚洲的工人已经受够了帝国主义统治的残暴恐怖和野蛮剥削了。在朝鲜、越南、马来亚与菲律宾，他们正在进行武装斗争，其他地方即使没有武装，却处处有着极大的勇气。
    在苏维埃亚细亚与新中国——那里的工人已经站立起来并消灭了失业、饥饿与民族压迫——的光荣榜样的鼓舞之下，亚洲其他部分的工人们，在今年的“五一”节将为争取较好的生活而进行更加坚决的斗争。
    今年“五一”节，千百万被压迫人民的心思将向着在北京与中国其他城市中的工人们所举行的和平与胜利的庆祝盛典。
    艾森豪威尔的违反人道的“亚洲人打亚洲人”的口号，在任何一个亚洲工人的心里也得不到一点良好反响。
    今年“五一”节，全世界工人阶级将在卡尔·马克思的不朽名言的精神之下，加强国际间的联系，这一名言就是：
    “全世界无产者，联合起来！”“无产者在这个革命中失去的只是锁链。而他们将会得到整个世界。”
