Report on the Industrial Situation
    ——Report at the Seventh National Congress of Chinese Trade Unions on the 7th Day
    Jia Tuofu, Deputy Director of the Financial and Economic Committee of the Government Administration Council
    Fellow representatives, honored guests:
    The presidium of the congress has arranged for me to give you a report on the industrial situation in our country.
    I would like to warmly congratulate the success of the congress and wish all representatives and guests good health!
    Please allow me to introduce the following situations to the comrades present. If there are any improprieties, please raise your opinions.
    (1) Recovery of the National Economy
    In the four years since the Sixth National Labor Congress, the brave, diligent, and revolutionary Chinese working class, under the leadership of Chairman Mao and the Chinese Communist Party, together with the people of the whole country, overthrew the evil forces of imperialism, feudalism, and bureaucratic capitalism in China, established the People's Republic of China, and carried out the great War to Resist U.S. Aggression and Aid Korea and various social reforms after the founding of the Republic. At the same time, our country has also carried out tremendous economic recovery work. After confiscating the enterprises of bureaucratic capitalism and turning them into state-owned enterprises, the Chinese working class, as the leading class of the country and the masters of state-owned enterprises, restored and developed production with high labor enthusiasm and creativity. The political status and working conditions of workers working in private enterprises have also undergone great changes. This has enabled our country to achieve great achievements in the industrial economy and promote the development of agriculture and other economic and cultural undertakings.
    By 1952, the situation of national economic recovery and development was:
    In terms of industrial production: Except for raw coal, the output of major products such as pig iron, steel, steel products, electricity, crude oil, electrolytic copper, soda ash, caustic soda, cement, cotton yarn, cotton cloth, paper, and sugar have all exceeded the highest annual output in the history of our country. As everyone knows, when we started to take over the enterprises of the Kuomintang bureaucratic capital, everything was broken, incomplete, and many factories were shut down or half-open, and productivity was extremely low. But after more than three years, the situation is completely different, and productivity has been greatly improved. Taking the output of 1949 as the base number, the output of pig iron in 1952 was 7.5 times, steel was 9.4 times, steel products were 8.2 times, electricity was 1.8 times, coal was 2 times, crude oil was 3.1 times, electrolytic copper was 10.2 times, soda ash was 1.9 times, caustic soda was 5.2 times, cement was 3.5 times, wood was 2.2 times, cotton yarn was 2 times, and cotton cloth was 2.3 times.
    The above figures clearly show the great achievements of our country in industrial production during the economic recovery period. The achievement of this achievement is primarily due to the creative labor of the Chinese working class. This patriotic spirit of the Chinese working class should be carried forward.
    In terms of agricultural production: In 1952, the national grain output reached 163.75 million tons, which was a large increase compared with 1949, and exceeded the highest output in history; the national cotton output reached 1.29 million tons, which was nearly twice that of 1949, and about 50% higher than the highest annual output in history; the output of other technical crops has also increased. This shows that our country has also achieved great achievements in agricultural production during the economic recovery period. The achievement of this achievement is mainly due to the peasants, who have undergone the great land reform struggle under the leadership of the working class and its political party—the Chinese Communist Party, have given play to their enthusiasm for production, and many peasants have already united in labor mutual aid and cooperation organizations. This patriotic spirit of the Chinese peasantry should also be carried forward.
    In line with the recovery and development of industrial and agricultural production, our country has also restored and greatly developed in foreign and domestic trade and transportation. For example, in 1952, foreign trade imports and exports were balanced; the railway freight turnover increased by 48% compared with the highest level in history. The national financial budget has been balanced. The national market is stable, and prices have been reduced in a planned manner; the wages and welfare of employees have greatly increased, the purchasing power of the people has greatly increased, and the people's lives have gradually improved. Our country has successfully completed Chairman Mao's call at the Third Plenary Session of the Seventh Central Committee of the CPC in June 1950 to strive for a fundamental improvement in the country's financial and economic situation in about three years.
    The recovery and development of our country's economy is inseparable from the consolidation of the people's democratic dictatorship system under the leadership of Chairman Mao and the Chinese Communist Party. Because this system is based on the working class as the leader and the worker-peasant alliance as the foundation, it demonstrates great superiority in the economy. The economic development has promoted the consolidation of the people's democratic dictatorship system, strengthened the leadership of the working class and the foundation of the worker-peasant alliance. At the same time, it must be pointed out that the recovery and development of our country's economy is inseparable from the selfless assistance of the great Soviet Union and various people's democratic countries to our country and the support of the international working class to our country. The Chinese working class and all the people express their heartfelt gratitude for this great internationalist spirit.
    The results of our country's economic recovery and development: First, the proportion of modern industry (i.e., industry using machines) in the total output value of industry and agriculture has increased. As everyone knows, the proportion of modern industry is an important indicator of the level of a country's economy. Second, in our country's entire modern industry, the proportion of state-owned industry has reached about 60%, indicating that the socialist economic component in the industrial economy has also greatly increased. As everyone knows, the proportion of socialist economic components is the most important indicator that determines the future of a country. Therefore, constantly increasing the proportion of our country's modern industry and the proportion of the socialist economy is the only correct path to realizing our country's industrialization and gradually transitioning to a socialist society.
    The above situation determines that it is not only necessary but also possible for our country to develop our country's industry in a planned way and lead the entire national economy to gradually move onto the track of national planning.
    (2) New Construction Tasks
    Starting in 1953, our country has entered the first five-year plan for construction.
    The great goal of our country's new construction is to "transform an agricultural country into an industrial country," because "without industry, there will be no solid national defense, no people's welfare, and no national prosperity" (Chairman Mao, "On Coalition Government"); therefore, the basic task of our country's first five-year plan is to concentrate forces on the construction of heavy industry, to lay the foundation for national industrialization, and to ensure the steady growth of the proportion of socialist components in the national economy. Under this general goal, correspondingly develop light industry; actively develop agriculture and handicrafts, and promote their collectivization in a step-by-step manner; correctly give play to the role of all private enterprises that are beneficial to the national economy and the people's livelihood, and improve the material and cultural level of the people on the basis of developing production.
    Why should our country's new construction focus on the development of heavy industry? Because only heavy industry, only the construction and development of industries such as steel, coal, electricity, petroleum, machine manufacturing, non-ferrous metals, and basic chemicals, can establish our country's powerful economic and defense forces; can guarantee our country's complete economic independence on the basis of expanded reproduction; can create a material and technical foundation for the collectivization of agriculture, so that agriculture can be fundamentally transformed; can give light industry a prospect for development; can ensure the continuous development and upsurge of our country's economy, continuously improve the people's lives, and enable our country to victoriously move towards socialism.
    During our country's first five-year plan period, our country's industry will have tremendous development. More steel, coal, electricity, petroleum, non-ferrous metals, machinery, building materials, chemical products, and light industrial products will be supplied to the country and the people's needs; many new industrial products that our country has never manufactured in history will begin to be produced in large quantities. Taking the first year of our country's five-year construction plan—1953—as an example, the total output value of industrial production will increase by about 23% compared with 1952, of which state-owned industry will increase by about 32%. The percentage data of the increase in various major products in the country compared with 1952 will be:
    Pig iron 13.3, steel ingot 22.1, steel products 34.8, copper 28.6, lead 34.6, zinc 32, electricity 18.3, crude oil 29.1, metal cutting machine tools (in units) 4.6, generators 190.9, electric motors (in kilowatts) 41.2, nitric acid 34.3, ammonium sulfate 32, cement 29.7, cotton yarn 9.4, cotton cloth 10.5, paper 7.9, wood 38. In 1953, the new types of products that began to be manufactured in the plan include: seamless steel pipes, silicon steel sheets, 6,000-kilowatt steam turbines and generators, 20,000-kilovolt-ampere transformers, 1,450-kilowatt electric motors, Soviet-style gantry planers, Soviet-style vertical lathes, 3-meter plate shears, and 5-meter spiral milling machines.
    In 1953, the total investment in basic construction of the state-owned industrial sector will increase by 150% compared with the estimated completion number in 1952. In terms of heavy industry, the construction of large-scale rolling mills and seamless steel pipe plants will be completed in this year; the construction of No. 7 blast furnace will be carried out; and the construction of thin plate plants will continue. In terms of the fuel industry, six large-scale power stations will be installed in 1953, and 395 kilometers of ultra-high-voltage power transmission lines will be constructed; the construction of eight pairs of vertical shafts and two open-pit coal mines will continue, and three new inclined shafts will be built; the petroleum industry will drill 48,000 meters and drill 15 production wells. In terms of the machinery industry, more than ten large-scale projects will start new construction and reconstruction, including: automobile manufacturing plants, heavy machinery manufacturing plants, electrical machinery manufacturing plants, measuring tool and cutting tool manufacturing plants, mining machinery manufacturing plants, machine tool manufacturing plants, pneumatic tool manufacturing plants, shipbuilding plants, locomotive and freight car manufacturing plants, and textile machinery manufacturing plants. In terms of textiles and light industry, four new cotton spinning factories and two flax raw material factories will be built; a new paper mill will be built and two paper mills will be renovated; two new pharmaceutical factories will be built and expanded; and two rubber factories will be expanded.
    In 1953, the labor productivity of state-owned industrial sectors will increase by 16%, and the cost will be reduced by 6.4%; the wages of employees will also be increased.
    Comrades, according to the above plan, even with the scale of industrial construction in our country in 1953, it should be admitted that it is also very huge, and the task of completing the national construction plan falls on the shoulders of our country's working class. Therefore, organizing all employees to launch labor competitions, improve labor productivity, complete and overfulfill the national plan, and struggle for improving product quality and reducing costs is our glorious and great task.
    In developing our country's industry, there are many difficulties. On the whole, our country's industrial base is still very weak and the technology is backward; the necessary survey and design forces for basic construction are quite lacking, and the preparation of resource data is insufficient; there is a shortage of cadres and funds; and the adjustment work of state-owned industries has not been completed. These are our difficulties. If we ignore these difficulties, we will make the mistake of impetuosity and may bring greater difficulties and harm to the country's construction cause.
    But does this mean that due to these difficulties, our country cannot develop our country's industry in a planned way? The fact is not so. Whether from domestic and foreign, political and economic perspectives, we still have many extremely favorable conditions, and these favorable conditions are the basic aspects. From the domestic situation, first of all, we have a new social system. This people's democratic system, led by the working class and based on the worker-peasant alliance, has unlimited vitality and makes it possible for all working people to give play to their infinite creativity. Secondly, our country has carried out tremendous social reforms. With the victory of social reforms and the victory of the War to Resist U.S. Aggression and Aid Korea, our country's economy has recovered, the financial situation has fundamentally improved, the leading position of the socialist economy in the national economy has been strengthened, and the cooperative economy and the state capitalist economy have developed to a certain extent. That is to say, the entire national economy has been basically restored and developed, which makes it possible for us to carry out our country's industrial construction on the basis of economic recovery. Our country has abundant resources and manpower, which makes it possible for us to rely on our own efforts to build our huge industry and new agriculture. And especially important, we have the correct leadership of Chairman Mao and the Chinese Communist Party. Our leader and our party are armed with the great theories of Marx, Engels, Lenin, and Stalin. He guides us from victory to victory. Is there any doubt about this? From the international situation, we have the strong support of the world's peace-loving people and the international working class; we also have a unified socialist peace and democracy international market. The members of this market do not aim at profiting but at mutual economic development and friendly assistance. It will promote the development of our country's economic undertakings; in particular, we have the economic and technical assistance of the great socialist Soviet Union. They help us with cheap equipment and superb technology. The above favorable conditions will ensure the rapid advancement of our country's industrial construction.
    Therefore, there is no doubt that our country has the conditions to carry out industrial construction in a planned way. We believe that the working class of the whole country, together with all the people, will bravely overcome all difficulties and steadily move our country towards the road of socialism.
    (3) Several Issues in the Current Management of State-owned Factories and Mines
    Currently, we are facing extremely arduous tasks and complex organizational work in our industrial production and basic construction. We have achieved great achievements in industry in the past, but at the same time, there are many problems and shortcomings.
    What are the main problems and shortcomings in the management of our state-owned factories and mines?
    In terms of industrial production management: some factories and mines still lack a sound planning management system. In the preparation of production plans, there are conservative ideas, such as underestimating equipment capacity, labor efficiency, recovery rate, etc., and overestimating production consumption quotas; underestimating the positive factors that promote production and overestimating the negative factors that affect production. In the execution of the plan, some factories and mines cannot complete the plan on time, evenly, and comprehensively. They are loose at the beginning and tight at the end. They fail to complete the plan at the beginning of the month and quarter, and rely on rushing at the end of the month and quarter to complete it; some major products fail to complete the plan, so they have to use excess secondary products to make up for it; a few backward factories and mines fail to complete the plan, so they have to use better factories and mines to over fulfill it; some factories and mines have completed the output plan, but fail to complete the variety, quality plan, or cost, financial plan. There are also some factories and mines that lack a sound responsibility system. The phenomenon of everyone being responsible but no one being responsible has not been completely overcome, so that management work is passive and chaotic. When problems occur in production, no specific responsible person can be found. There are also some factories and mines that do not pay attention to equipment maintenance and safety work, resulting in major casualties and equipment damage accidents; they cannot always pay attention to the welfare of employees, and do not effectively solve the problems existing in employee wages and welfare facilities. There are also some factories and mines that lack a sound economic accounting system, and the idea of the supply system has not been completely overcome, and cost management and financial management are still very weak. The above problems and shortcomings are the main reasons for the low quality, high cost, and many accidents of industrial products. In this way, the state's income is reduced, the state's property is wasted, and it is difficult to meet the needs of the state and the people. It also shows that the level of our industrial management work is still lagging behind the objective needs.
    In terms of industrial basic construction management: some enterprises do not effectively calculate the objective possibilities when preparing plans, do not combine needs with possibilities, and do not act according to their capabilities, that is to say, they only proceed from subjective wishes or the local needs of the unit, so that the plan is divorced from the possible conditions and becomes a plan that is greedy and aggressive and deviates from reality. Some enterprises do not pay enough attention to basic construction work, especially failing to take appropriate measures to strengthen survey and design forces, failing to take effective measures to overcome the bourgeois erroneous ideological style of some designers, or failing to arrange the progress and organization of survey and design work well. In this way, the survey and design work is in a backward state, unable to keep up with the requirements of construction. There are also some enterprises that do not organize the construction management of basic construction well, especially lacking a responsibility system, and cannot carry out the design of construction organization well. The above problems and shortcomings cause the accumulation of state funds, some important projects cannot be completed on schedule, the quality of the project is poor, and a backlog of work is formed, and a lot of waste is generated (waste of raw materials, waste of labor, waste of mechanical equipment, waste caused by conservative quotas, waste caused by poor quality or rework, etc.).
    The above problems and shortcomings are mainly due to our lack of experience in industrial management. We have only just begun to learn, and we have not learned well enough. From the overall situation, the development of work in various regions and various industrial sectors is unbalanced. Some have initially established a foundation for work, while others have just started to establish it. There are also many places where the cooperation between various industrial sectors, industrial and other economic sectors or cultural and educational sectors is not close or not connected, so that some disconnections often occur. From the perspective of national planning work, it is also just beginning to be established, and the system is very unsound. Therefore, there are certain problems and shortcomings in the management of factories and mines. It cannot be said that there are no certain objective reasons. But is it possible to ignore the shortcomings and problems in our work or fail to take appropriate measures to overcome the shortcomings and solve the problems? That is absolutely impossible. Because correctly solving these problems and overcoming these shortcomings can push our industrial management work forward and improve the level of leadership work, so as to adapt to the needs of future national industrial construction.
    In order to solve the above problems and overcome the shortcomings, so that our level of managing industry can be improved, in addition to constantly summarizing and accumulating successful experiences, drawing lessons from failures, and working hard to learn and improve, I think we should pay special attention to the following points:
    First, establish and strengthen planning management. In production, we must oppose conservative ideas, and in basic construction, we must oppose the idea of greed and progress and local views (these are all manifestations of blindness in industrial work, manifestations of subjectivism and bureaucracy). To this end, we must improve the planning and statistical institutions from top to bottom and strengthen planning management. In terms of basic construction, we should especially understand and study the conditions of needs and possibilities, clarify the conditions of resources, transportation, power supply, water power, labor and technical forces, study and approve various quotas, and arrange the project schedule, so that the plan is based on a reliable foundation and completes the project schedule on schedule. In terms of production, the plan should be combined with the broad masses. According to the national plan, all factories and enterprises should mobilize the masses to fully discuss, so as to mobilize the masses to launch labor competitions, develop collective wisdom, and make the plan truly an advanced plan and an action program for millions of laborers. And complete the national plan evenly and comprehensively. At the same time, a strict plan inspection system should be established to correct shortcomings in a timely manner, disseminate advanced experience, and strive to overfulfill the national plan.
    Second, establish and improve the responsibility system. All economic sectors should gradually establish a scientific management system, requiring every task, every machine, every project, every construction site, and every enterprise to have special responsible personnel and a sound responsibility system, and eliminate the phenomenon of everyone being responsible but no one being responsible; special attention should be paid to establishing a safety production responsibility system, product quality responsibility system, design work responsibility system, raw material and equipment supply responsibility system, construction responsibility system, and contact system. Through the establishment and improvement of these special responsibility systems, eliminate the phenomenon of no one being responsible that still exists in our enterprises. This is the main content of the anti-bureaucracy struggle in enterprises.
    Third, vigorously promote learning from the Soviet Union and promote advanced experience. Staff members of industrial departments and factories and enterprises are required to study their business, become experts, be good at learning and applying the advanced experience of the Soviet Union in building socialism, and combine the theory and science and technology of the Soviet Union in building socialism with the practice of our country's economic construction, especially those advanced experiences with decisive significance, including advanced technology and advanced working methods, must be vigorously and universally promoted, and the ideological and technical level of technical personnel should be gradually improved in the process of promotion.
    Fourth, gradually implement a strict economic accounting system. Everything possible should be done to give full play to the potential of enterprises, implement the strictest economy, learn to use national funds more economically and rationally; improve the enterprise's financial accounting system, strengthen the state's financial supervision, and constantly struggle against various phenomena of wasting state property. Enterprises should implement an effective contract system with each other according to the plan. Ensure the completion and overfulfillment of the plan for accumulating funds to consolidate the national budget.
    Fifth, in addition to the above, we should also pay special attention to the following tasks: (1) Vigorously strengthen the exploration of underground resources, actively collect design data for major projects, and improve the quality of geological work; (2) Continue to improve the design organization and strengthen the design force, and in practical work, use specific examples to educate and improve the political awareness and technical level of existing designers; (3) Do everything possible to make full use of our existing equipment, and take effective measures to adjust the existing machinery industry, and gradually achieve a clear division of labor, so that each factory can relatively specialize in production, so as to give play to the capacity of the existing machinery industry and strive to supply more machinery and equipment needed for construction; (4) Train and cultivate technical personnel and skilled workers in a planned and large-scale manner to meet the needs of long-term construction.
    We believe that strengthening the leadership and supervision of the Communist Party over state-owned factories and mines and strengthening ideological and political work in industrial work have a decisive significance for improving the level of industrial management. It cannot be assumed that our industrial management work can be separated from or weakened by the leadership of the Party, or that ideological and political work can be relaxed; of course, it cannot be assumed that political work can be carried out in isolation from industrial production and basic construction work. We must continue to implement the principle of combining political work and economic work.
    We believe that all work in state-owned factories and mines must be done well by relying on the masses. In factories and mines, the masses are workers, technicians, and staff members. Therefore, the comrades of the trade union, like the administrative management of factories and mines, bear very important and glorious responsibilities, because the trade union not only has an important responsibility in organizing the workers to launch labor competitions, increase production, and improve labor productivity, but also has a special responsibility in educating the workers and improving the political, cultural, and technical level of the workers. According to the teachings of Lenin and Stalin, the trade union is a school of communism, and it should also be a school for learning to manage socialist industry and learning to supervise the production of private enterprises. It connects and educates millions of employees, connects the advanced elements of the working class with the backward elements, and connects the workers with the vanguard of the working class.
    Comrades, no matter how many difficulties and obstacles we face, we believe that the brave and hardworking Chinese working class, with a tradition of revolutionary struggle, will, together with the people of the whole country, under the wise leadership of our great leader Chairman Mao, take on the new industrial construction tasks of our country and victoriously complete these tasks!

    关于工业情况的报告
    ——在中国工会第七次全国代表大会七日会议上的报告
    政务院财政经济委员会副主任　贾拓夫各位代表、各位来宾：
    大会主席团约定我来向同志们作一次关于我国工业情况的报告。
    我在这里热烈祝贺大会的成功，祝贺各位代表、各位来宾身体健康！
    请允许我向到会同志介绍以下一些情况，如有不妥当的地方，请你们提出意见。
    （一）国民经济的恢复
    自第六次全国劳动大会以后四年多中间，勇敢、勤劳并富有革命传统的中国工人阶级，在毛主席和中国共产党的领导下，和全国人民一道，推翻了帝国主义、封建主义、官僚资本主义恶势力在中国的统治，建立了中华人民共和国，并于共和国成立后进行了伟大的抗美援朝斗争及各种社会改革。与此同时，我国又进行了巨大的经济恢复工作。在没收了官僚资本主义的企业变为国家的企业以后，作为国家领导阶级和国营企业主人的中国工人阶级，以高度的劳动积极性和创造性，恢复和发展了生产，在私营企业中工作的工人们，他们的政治地位与劳动条件也有很大的改变。这样就使我国在工业经济方面获得了巨大的成就，并促进了农业及其他经济事业、文教事业的发展。
    一九五二年为止，全国经济的恢复和发展的情况是：
    在工业生产方面：主要产品除原煤以外，其他如生铁、钢、钢材、电力、原油、电铜、纯碱、烧碱、水泥、棉纱、棉布、纸、糖等均已超过我国历史上最高年产量。大家知道，当我们开始接管国民党官僚资本的企业时，到处是破破烂烂，残缺不全，许多工厂停工或半开工，生产力极其低下。但经过三年多的时间，情形就完全不同了，生产力有很大提高。如以一九四九年的产量为基数，则一九五二年生铁为七·五倍，钢为九·四倍，钢材为八·二倍，电力为一·八倍，煤为二倍，原油为三·一倍，电铜为一○·二倍，纯碱为一·九倍，烧碱为五·二倍，水泥为三·五倍，木材为二·二倍，棉纱为二倍，棉布为二·三倍。
    上述数字，可以清楚地了解我国在恢复经济期间在工业生产方面的巨大成就，这种成就的获得首先是由于我国工人阶级的创造性的劳动。中国工人阶级的这种爱国主义精神，是应该发扬光大的。
    在农业生产方面：一九五二年全国粮食产量已达一亿六千三百七十五万吨，比一九四九年有很大的增加，并超过了历史上最高产量；全国棉花产量已达一百二十九万吨，将近达到一九四九年的两倍，约超过历史上最高年产量百分之五十左右；其他技术作物亦有增加。这说明我国在恢复经济期间，在农业生产上也获得了巨大成就，这种成就的获得，主要是由于在工人阶级及其政党——中国共产党领导下，经过了伟大土地改革斗争的农民，发挥了生产积极性，并有不少的农民已经团结在劳动互助合作的组织中。中国农民阶级的这种爱国主义精神，也是应该发扬光大的。
    与工农业生产的恢复和发展相适应，我国在国内外贸易和交通运输等方面，也得到恢复，并有了很大发展。如一九五二年国外贸易出入口已经平衡；铁路货运周转量比历史上最高水平增加百分之四八。国家财政预算已经平衡。全国市场稳定，物价已有计划地予以降低；职工工资和福利已有很大增长，人民购买力已有很大提高，人民生活已逐步有所改善。我国已胜利地完成了毛主席一九五○年六月在中共七届三中全会上关于在三年左右时间内争取国家财政经济根本好转的号召。
    我国经济的恢复与发展，是与在毛主席、中国共产党领导下的人民民主专政制度的巩固分不开的。因为这一制度是以工人阶级为领导、工农联盟为基础，它就在经济上表现了极大的优越性。而经济的发展，又促进了人民民主专政制度的巩固，加强了工人阶级的领导和工农联盟的基础。这里同时必须指出，我国经济的恢复和发展，是和伟大苏联和各人民民主国家对我国的无私的援助以及国际工人阶级对我国的支援分不开的。对于这种伟大的国际主义精神，中国工人阶级和全体人民表示衷心的感谢。
    我国经济的恢复和发展的结果：第一，我国现代工业（即使用机器的工业）在工农业总产值中所占的比重已有增长。大家知道，现代工业的比重正是衡量国家经济水平的重要的标志。第二，在我国全部现代工业中，国营工业的比重已达到百分之六十左右，说明我国社会主义经济成份在工业经济中亦有很大增长。大家知道，社会主义经济成份的比重，是决定一个国家前途的最重要的标志。因此，不断增长我国现代工业的比重及社会主义经济的比重，是实现我们国家的工业化和逐步过渡到社会主义社会的唯一正确的道路。
    以上情况，决定了我国现在不但有必要、而且已有可能来有计划地发展我国的工业，并领导全部国民经济逐步走向国家计划的轨道。
    （二）新的建设任务
    一九五三年开始，我国已进入第一个五年计划的建设。
    我国新的建设的伟大目标，就是要“变农业国为工业国”，因为“没有工业，便没有巩固的国防，便没有人民的福利，便没有国家的富强”（毛主席
    “论联合政府”）；因此，我国第一个五年计划的基本任务，在于集中力量进行重工业的建设，为国家工业化建立基础，并保证国民经济中社会主义成份的比重稳步地增长。在这一总的目标之下，相适应地发展轻工业；积极地发展农业和手工业，有步骤地促进其合作化；正确地发挥一切有利于国计民生的私营企业的作用，并在发展生产的基础上，提高人民的物质和文化水平。
    我国新的建设，为什么应以发展重工业为中心环节呢？因为只有重工业，只有钢铁、煤、电力、石油、机器制造、有色金属、基本化学等工业的建设和发展，才能建立起我国强大的经济力量和国防力量；才能在扩大再生产的基础上，保证我国在经济上的完全独立；才能为农业的集体化创造物质和技术的基础，使农业得到根本的改造；才能给轻工业以发展的前途；才能保证我国经济的不断发展和高涨，使人民生活不断提高，并使我国胜利地走向社会主义。
    在我国第一个五年计划期内，我国的工业将有巨大的发展。将有更多的钢铁、煤炭、电力、石油、有色金属、机器、建筑材料、化学产品和轻工业品供给国家和人民的需要；将有许多种我国历史上从未制造过的新的工业产品，开始大量生产。即以我国五年建设计划的头一年——一九五三年的建设规模来说，工业生产的总产值比一九五二年将增长百分之二十三左右，其中国营工业将增长百分之三十二左右。全国各种主要产品比一九五二年增长的百分数据最近的计算将为：
    生铁一三·三，钢锭二二·一，钢材三四·八，铜二八·六，铅三四·六，锌三二，电力一八·三，原油二九·一，金属切削机床（以台计）四·六，发电机一九○·九，电动机（以瓩计）四一·二，硝酸三四·三，硫酸铵三二，水泥二九·七，棉纱九·四，棉布一○·五，纸七·九，木材三八。一九五三年计划中开始制造的新种类产品有：无缝钢管、矽钢片、六千瓩的蒸气透平和发电机、二万千伏安的变压器、一千四百五十瓩的电动机、苏式龙门刨、苏式立式车床、三米的剪板机及五米螺旋铣床等。
    一九五三年工业部门基本建设的总投资额，将比一九五二年预计完成数增加百分之一五○。在重工业方面，今年内将完成大型轧钢厂、无缝钢管厂的建设；进行第七号高炉的建设；继续薄板厂的建设。燃料工业方面，一九五三年将有六个较大规模的电站进行安装工程，建设特高压送电线三百九十五公里；继续建设八对立井、两个露天煤矿，新建三处斜井；石油工业将钻井四万八千公尺，另打生产井十五口。机械工业方面，将有十个以上的较大工程开始新建和改建，这些工程中包括：汽车制造厂、重型机械制造厂、电器机械制造厂、量具刃具制造厂、工矿机械制造厂、工作母机制造厂、风动工具制造厂、船舶制造厂、机车货车制造厂及纺织机械制造厂等。纺织、轻工业方面，将新建四个棉纺工厂，两个亚麻原料厂；新建一个造纸厂，改建两个造纸厂；新建和扩建两个制药厂；扩建两个橡胶厂。
     一九五三年国营工业部门劳动生产率将提高百分之十六，成本将降低百分之六·四；职工工资亦将有所提高。
    同志们，根据上述计划，即以一九五三年我国的工业建设规模来说，应当承认，也是十分巨大的，而完成国家建设计划的任务，正是落在我国工人阶级的身上。因此，组织全体职工展开劳动竞赛，提高劳动生产率，完成和超额完成国家的计划，并为提高产品质量、降低成本而斗争，就是我们光荣而伟大的任务。
    在发展我国的工业当中，我们是存在着不少的困难的。整个说来，我国工业基础仍很薄弱，技术落后；进行基本建设所必需的勘察、设计等力量，颇为缺乏，资源的资料准备不够；干部、资金均感不足；国营工业本身的调整工作尚未完成。这些就是我们的困难。如果忽视这些困难，就要犯急躁冒进的错误，并可能给国家建设事业带来更大的困难和危害。
    但这是不是说，由于这些困难，我国就不能有计划地发展我国的工业呢？事实并非如此，不论从国内和国外、从政治上和经济上看，我们还有许多极为有利的条件，而且，这些有利条件是基本的方面。从国内情况说，首先，我们有了一个新的社会制度，这个以工人阶级为领导的、工农联盟为基础的、具有无限生命力的人民民主制度，就有可能使全体劳动人民发挥无穷的创造力。其次，我国已进行了巨大的社会改革。随着社会改革的胜利和抗美援朝斗争的胜利，我国经济已经恢复，财政状况已根本好转，社会主义经济在国民经济中的领导地位业已加强，合作经济和国家资本主义经济已有一定程度的发展。这就是说，整个国民经济已经得到基本的恢复和发展，这就有可能使我们在经济恢复的基础上进行我国的工业建设。我国有丰富的资源和人力，它使我们有可能依靠自己的努力来建设我们的巨大的工业和新的农业。而特别重要的，我们有着毛主席和中国共产党的正确领导，我们的领袖和我们的党，是以马克思、恩格斯、列宁、斯大林的伟大学说武装了的，他引导着我们从胜利走向胜利。对于这些，难道还有疑问吗？从国际情况说，我们有着爱好和平的世界人民及国际工人阶级的有力支援；我们又有着统一的社会主义和平民主的国际市场，这个市场的成员不是以牟利为目的，而是以互相发展经济和友好的援助为目的，它将促进我国经济事业的发展；特别是，我们有着伟大的社会主义苏联在经济、技术上的援助，他们以廉价的装备和精湛的技术帮助我们。上述有利条件，将保证我国工业建设大踏步的前进。
    因此，毫无疑义，我国已具备了各种条件来有计划地进行工业建设，我们相信全国工人阶级和全体人民一道，将勇敢地克服一切困难，使我国稳步地走向社会主义的大道。
    （三）目前国营厂矿企业管理工作中的几个问题
    目前在我们的工业生产和基本建设中，面临着极为繁重的任务和复杂的组织工作。我们过去在工业方面已获得了巨大的成就，但同时也存在着不少的问题和缺点。
    在我们国营厂矿企业的管理工作中，存在的主要问题和缺点是什么呢？
    在工业生产管理方面：有些厂矿还缺乏健全的计划管理制度，在编制生产计划时，存在着保守思想，如过低地计算设备能力、劳动效率、回收率等，过高地计算生产消耗定额；过低地估计那些促进生产的积极因素，过高地估计那些影响生产的消极因素。在执行计划时，有些厂矿不能按期均衡地全面地完成计划，前松后紧，月初、季初完不成计划，靠月末、季末突击去完成；某些主要产品完不成计划，只好用次要产品超额去弥补；少数落后的厂矿完不成计划，只好用较好厂矿超额去弥补；某些厂矿完成了产量计划，但完不成品种、质量的计划或成本、财务的计划。也有一些厂矿，缺乏健全的责任制度，大家负责而又无人负责的现象尚未完全克服，以致管理工作陷于被动和混乱，生产中发生问题，找不到一定的责任者。也有一些厂矿，不注意设备检修和保安工作，以致发生重大的伤亡事故和设备损伤事故；不能经常地注意职工的福利，不切实解决职工工资和福利设施中存在的问题。还有一些厂矿，缺乏健全的经济核算制度，供给制思想还未完全克服，成本管理和财务管理还很薄弱。上述问题和缺点，是造成工业产品质量低、成本高、事故多的主要原因。这样，就降低了国家的收入，浪费了国家的资财，并难于满足国家和人民的需要。它同时表现了我们工业管理工作的水平还落后于客观的需要。
    在工业基本建设管理方面：有些企业单位在编制计划时，不切实计算客观的可能性，不把需要与可能相结合地去考虑，不量力而行，也就是说，只从主观愿望或本单位的局部需要出发，因此使计划脱离了可能的条件，变成贪多冒进、离开实际的计划。有些企业单位，对基本建设工作重视不够，特别是不采取适当的措施加强勘察、设计的力量，对某些设计人员的资产阶级的错误思想作风不采取有效的办法加以克服，或者对勘察、设计工作的进度和组织不能很好安排。这样，就使勘察、设计工作处于落后的状态，赶不上施工的要求。还有一些企业单位，对基本建设的施工管理组织得不好，特别是缺乏责任制度，不能很好进行施工组织的设计。上述问题和缺点，造成国家资金的积压，某些重要工程不能按期完成任务，工程质量不好，形成窝工现象，并产生不少的浪费（原材料的浪费、劳动力的浪费、机械设备的浪费、定额保守造成的浪费、质量低劣或返工造成的浪费等等）。
      上述问题和缺点的产生，主要是由于我们在工业管理上还缺乏经验，我们才开始学习，我们还学习得不够好。从整个情况说来，各个地区和各个工业部门工作的发展是不平衡的，有的已初步建立了工作的基础，有的则刚才在着手建立。在各个工业部门之间、工业和其他各种经济部门或文教部门之间，在配合上也有许多不密切、不衔接的地方，以致常常发生某些脱节现象。从国家计划工作来说，也还是刚开始创立，制度很不健全。因此，厂矿企业管理工作中存在着某些问题和缺点，不能说没有
    一定的客观原因。但是不是就可以对我们工作中的缺点和问题，不加正视或不采取适当办法去克服缺点、解决问题呢？那是绝不可以的。因为正确地解决这些问题，克服这些缺点，才能使我们的工业管理工作向前推进一步，并提高领导工作的水平，才能适应今后国家工业化建设的需要。
    为了解决上述问题和克服缺点，使我们管理工业的水平提高一步，除了我们应经常不断地总结和积累成功的经验，吸取失败的教训，并努力学习加以改进外，我觉得目前应特别注意下列几点：
    第一、建立与加强计划管理。在生产中要反对保守思想，在基本建设中要反对贪多冒进思想和局部观点（这一些都是工业工作中盲目性的表现，主观主义和官僚主义的表现）。为此，就要健全自上而下的计划、统计机构，加强计划管理工作。在基本建设方面，特别应了解研究需要与可能的条件，弄清资源情况、交通运输、电源水力、劳动与技术力量等条件，研究和审定各种定额，排列工程进度，使计划建立在可靠的基础上面，并按期完成工程进度。在生产方面，应使计划与广大群众相结合，各厂矿、各企业根据国家的计划，发动群众充分讨论，以便动员群众展开劳动竞赛，发扬集体的智慧，使计划真正成为先进的计划，成为千百万劳动者的行动纲领。并均衡地全面地完成国家计划。同时应建立严格的计划检查制度，及时纠正缺点，传播先进经验，争取超额完成国家计划。
    第二、建立与健全责任制度。一切经济部门均应逐步地建立科学的管理制度，要求每一项工作，每一台机器，每一件工程，每一个工地，每一个企业均有专责人员和健全的责任制度，消灭大家负责而又无人负责的现象；要特别注意建立安全生产责任制、产品质量责任制、设计工作责任制、原材料及设备供应责任制、施工责任制以及联系制度等。经过建立与健全这些专责制度，消灭我们企业中仍然存在着无人负责的现象。这是企业中贯彻反官僚主义斗争的主要内容。
    第三、大力提倡学习苏联和推广先进经验。要求工业部门和厂矿企业的工作人员，钻研业务，成为内行，善于学习和运用苏联建设社会主义的先进经验，把苏联建设社会主义的理论和科学技术与我国经济建设的实践相结合，特别是那些有决定意义的先进经验，包括先进技术和先进的工作方法，必须大力普遍推广，在推广过程中逐步提高技术人员的思想和技术水平。
    第四、逐步实行严格的经济核算制度。应尽一切可能充分发挥企业的潜在力量，实行最严格的节约，学会更经济更合理地使用国家的资金；健全企业的财务会计制度，加强国家的财政监督，经常与各种浪费国家资财的现象作斗争。企业相互之间，应根据计划实行有效的合同制度。保证完成和超额完成积累资金的计划，以巩固国家预算。
    第五、除上述各项以外，还应特别重视以下各项工作：（一）大力加强地下资源的勘探工作，积极收集重大工程的设计资料，并提高地质工作的质量；（二）继续健全设计组织和壮大设计力量，在实际工作中，用具体事例来教育和提高现有设计人员的政治觉悟和技术水平；（三）尽一切可能充分利用我们现有的设备，并采取有效措施调整现有的机械工业，逐步作到明确分工，使各个工厂能够相对地专业生产，以发挥现有机械工业的能力，争取更多地供应建设所需要的机器设备；（四）有计划地大量地训练和培养技术人员和熟练工人，以适应长期建设的需要。
    我们认为加强共产党对国营厂矿的领导和监督，加强工业工作中的思想政治工作，对提高工业管理工作的水平有着决定的意义。决不能设想，我们的工业管理工作可以丝毫离开或减弱党的领导，或者可以放松思想政治工作；当然也不能设想政治工作可以脱离工业生产和基本建设工作而孤立地去进行。我们必须继续贯彻政治工作和经济工作相结合的原则。
    我们认为在国营厂矿中的一切工作，都是要依靠群众才能办好的。在厂矿中，群众就是工人、技术人员和职员。因此工会工作的同志们也和厂矿的行政管理方面一样，担负着很重要和光荣的责任，因为工会不仅在组织工人群众展开劳动竞赛、增加生产、提高劳动生产率方面有其重要的责任，而且在教育工人群众，提高工人群众的政治、文化、技术的水平等方面，又有其特殊的责任。按照列宁、斯大林的教导，工会是共产主义的学校，又应当是学习管理社会主义工业和学习监督私营企业生产的学校，它联系而且教育千百万职工群众，使工人阶级中的先进分子与落后分子联系起来，使工人群众与工人阶级先锋队联系起来。
    同志们，不论我们面前有多少困难和障碍，但我们相信，勇敢而勤劳并富有革命斗争传统的中国工人阶级，一定能和全国人民一道，在我们伟大的领袖毛主席的英明领导下，把我国新的工业建设任务担当起来，并胜利地完成这些任务！
