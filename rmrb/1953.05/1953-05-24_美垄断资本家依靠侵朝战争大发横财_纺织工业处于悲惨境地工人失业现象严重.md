Xinhua News Agency, 21st, New York Dispatch: American monopoly capitalists are rapidly expanding their assets by amassing fortunes from the Korean War.

According to the Associated Press, the number of American corporations with assets exceeding one billion dollars has increased from twenty-four to twenty-nine in the past year (excluding eighteen banks, fourteen insurance companies, and two silver companies with assets exceeding one billion dollars). The total assets of these twenty-nine large companies amount to $58.73 billion, 11 percent more than the total assets of the twenty-four large companies with assets exceeding one billion dollars in 1951. These twenty-nine large companies are: Bell Telephone Company, Standard Oil of New Jersey, General Motors Corporation, Pennsylvania Railroad Company, United States Steel Corporation, Bethlehem Steel Corporation, DuPont Company, Ford Motor Company, General Electric Company, Westinghouse Electric Corporation, Pacific Gas and Electric Company, Consolidated Edison Company, Commonwealth Edison Company, Union Carbide and Carbon Corporation, New York Central Railroad Company, Southern Pacific Railroad Company, Santa Fe Railroad Company, Union Pacific Railroad Company, Baltimore and Ohio Railroad Company, International Harvester Company, Sears, Roebuck and Company, Standard Oil of New York, Standard Oil of Indiana, Texas Oil Company, Gulf Oil Corporation, Standard Oil of California, Cities Service Oil Company, Sinclair Oil Corporation, and an oil company affiliated with Standard Oil of New Jersey.

These companies have all profited immensely from the Korean War. Most of them have received large military orders from the government. For example, Bell Telephone Company, with assets of over $10.7 billion, has received over 100 important military orders from the Department of Defense, and its total assets have expanded by $1 billion in the past year. In the two years since the outbreak of the Korean War, General Motors Corporation has received military orders totaling $5.5 billion, earning profits of over a billion dollars. General Electric Company received military orders worth over $2.4 billion during the same period. Railroad companies have been particularly prosperous due to the heavy military transport caused by the Korean War. Due to large military orders and the so-called commercial “prosperity” stimulated by the Korean War, the sales volume of these companies has increased significantly, and they have obtained huge profits. Among the above-mentioned twenty-nine large companies, sixteen companies had sales exceeding $1 billion last year, and thirteen companies had net income after taxes exceeding $100 million.

In addition to these largest monopoly companies, American aircraft companies have also profited the most from the war. Although these aircraft companies have not yet joined the ranks of companies with assets exceeding $1 billion, they are all financially strong and receive the most military orders from the government. Therefore, their turnover has increased greatly, and their profits are particularly substantial. For example, Boeing Aircraft Company's sales volume last year increased by 84 percent compared to 1951, and its net income almost doubled. Lockheed Aircraft Company's sales volume increased by 85 percent, and its after-tax income increased by 56 percent. Douglas Aircraft Company's profits in 1952 increased by 56 percent compared to 1951, and North American Aircraft Company's profits increased by 21 percent.

American company profits have continued to increase since the beginning of this year. According to the Associated Press, in the first three months of this year, the total net income after taxes of 386 American companies increased by more than 10 percent compared to the same period last year. Among them, the profits of the manufacturing industry increased by 9 percent compared to the first quarter of last year, the profits of the railway industry increased by 19 percent compared to the first quarter of last year, and the profits of the aircraft industry doubled compared to the first quarter of last year.

Because these huge profits are linked to the American invasion of Korea, the Associated Press says that "many company managers are afraid that peace talks will reduce the government's military orders to their companies."

Xinhua News Agency, 22nd, TASS New York, 20th Dispatch: The "CIO News," published by the Congress of Industrial Organizations, carried information on the living conditions of workers in Lawrence, Massachusetts. For decades, this city has been known for its huge textile factories, and it was regarded as the capital of the woolen textile industry. However, in recent years, it has become famous for the large number of unemployed workers.

Due to the American industry's turn towards war production and the emergence of strong competitors in the world market, the American textile industry is in a tragic and difficult situation. Initially, small and medium-sized factories employing six to seven hundred workers closed down. Later, large factories also began to shrink or reduce production.

In 1952, four branches of the "Pacific" textile factory stopped production, laying off approximately two thousand textile workers. Next, the "Ayer" factory, which employed four thousand workers, went out of business. After the "Arlington" factory closed, seven thousand workers were declared unemployed. According to official data, more than 25 percent of the workers in Lawrence are currently unemployed. Many textile workers are doing odd jobs, and the wages they earn cannot maintain a basic standard of living.

The slim hope of better days deepens the tragedy of unemployed textile workers in Lawrence. Most of them believe that it is unnecessary to look for work in other cities, because everyone knows that unemployment is prevalent throughout the American textile industry.

    美垄断资本家依靠侵朝战争大发横财
    纺织工业处于悲惨境地工人失业现象严重
    【新华社二十一日讯】纽约消息：靠着朝鲜战争大发横财的美国垄断资本的资产正迅速膨胀。
    据美联社的消息：在过去一年内，资产在十亿美元以上的美国大企业公司已从二十四家增至二十九家（不包括资产在十亿美元以上的十八家银行、十四家保险公司及两家银公司）。这二十九家大公司的资产总额为五百八十七亿三千多万美元，比一九五一年资产在十亿美元以上的二十四家大公司的资产总额多百分之十一。这二十九家大公司是：贝尔电话公司、新泽西美孚油公司、通用汽车公司、宾夕法尼亚铁路公司、美国钢铁公司、伯利恒钢铁公司、杜邦公司、福特汽车公司、通用电气公司、威斯汀豪斯电气公司、太平洋煤气电气公司、爱迪生联合公司、联邦爱迪生公司、联合炭素及炭化物公司、纽约中央铁路公司、南太平洋铁路公司、圣他菲铁路公司、联合太平洋铁路公司、巴尔的摩俄亥俄铁路公司、国际收割机公司、西尔斯·罗伯克公司、纽约美孚油公司、印第安纳美孚油公司、得克萨斯石油公司、海湾石油公司、加利福尼亚美孚油公司、城市服务石油公司、辛克莱石油公司及新泽西美孚油公司附属的一家石油公司。
    这些公司都是因为朝鲜战争而利市百倍的。它们大多接受了政府大批军事订货。例如拥有资产一百零七亿余美元的贝尔电话公司就接受了国防部一百多类重要的军事订货，它的资产总额在去年一年里面扩充了十亿美元。通用汽车公司在朝鲜战争爆发后两年中间就接受了高达五十五亿美元的军事订货，获利十几个亿。通用电气公司同时期接受了二十四亿美元以上的军事订货。铁路公司是因为朝鲜战争造成的繁忙军运而生意特别兴隆的。由于大批军事订货和朝鲜战争刺激起来的所谓商业“繁荣”，这些公司的销货量都显著增加，并获得庞大的利润。在上述二十九家大公司中，十六家公司的销货量在去年超过十亿美元，十三家公司纳税后的纯收入在一亿美元以上。
    除了这些最大的垄断公司，美国的飞机公司也是从战争中得利最厚的。这些飞机公司虽然还没有挤入资产有十亿美元以上的公司之列，但也都是资金雄厚，又是接受政府军事订货最多的一些公司，因此营业额大增，利润也特别丰厚。例如，波音飞机公司的销货量在去年比一九五一年增加了百分之八十四，纯收入几乎增加了一倍。洛克希德飞机公司的销货量增加了百分之八十五，纳税后的收入增加百分之五十六。道格拉斯飞机公司的利润在一九五二年比一九五一年增加百分之五十六，北美飞机公司的利润增加百分之二十一。
    美国公司的利润在今年开年以来继续有增无已。据美联社消息，在今年头三个月，美国三百八十六家公司纳税后的纯收入一共比去年同期增加百分之十以上，其中制造业的利润比去年第一季大百分之九，铁路业的利润比去年第一季大百分之十九，飞机工业的利润比去年第一季大两倍。
    因为这些巨大利润与美国的侵朝战争连结在一起，所以据美联社说：“许多公司的经理唯恐和平谈判会使政府对他们公司的军事的订货减少。”
    【新华社二十二日讯】据塔斯社纽约二十日讯：产业工会联合会出版的“产联新闻”刊载了一篇关于马萨诸塞州劳伦斯城工人生活状况的资料。数十年来这个城市是以它的巨大的纺织工厂闻名的，它被视为毛织工业的首府。然而近几年来，它却以大批工人失业驰名。
    由于美国工业走上战争生产的轨道以及世界市场上出现强大的竞争者，美国纺织工业已处于悲惨的困难境地。最初是一些雇用六、七百工人的中小工厂关闭了，后来大工厂也开始萎缩或者削减生产。
    一九五二年，“太平洋”纺织工厂四个分厂停止了生产，解雇了约两千纺织工人。接着是雇有四千工人的“爱尔”工厂歇业了。“爱林登”工厂关门后，七千工人宣告失业。根据官方资料，目前劳伦斯城的工人有百分之二十五以上失业。很多纺织工人在作零活，他们所挣得的工资不能维持起码的生活。
    过好日子的希望的渺茫加深了劳伦斯城失业纺织工人的悲剧。他们大多数都认为没有必要到其他城市里去找工作，因为谁都知道美国整个纺织业普遍存在失业现象。
