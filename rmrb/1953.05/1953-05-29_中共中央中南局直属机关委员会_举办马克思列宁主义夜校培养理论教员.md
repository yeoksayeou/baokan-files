CPC Central Committee's Central South Bureau Directly Affiliated Organs Committee:
Holds Marxism-Leninism Night School to Train Theory Instructors

    In order to strengthen guidance for the theoretical study of cadres in service, the CPC Central Committee's Central South Bureau Directly Affiliated Organs Committee is actively carrying out training work for theoretical instructors.

    The Marxism-Leninism Night School for training intermediate and elementary level theory instructors already commenced classes on May 25th. In addition to the intermediate and elementary level theory instructors from the various directly affiliated organs of the Central South Bureau, theory instructors and study tutors from Hubei Province, Wuhan City, and the various organs under the Central South Military Region of the Chinese People's Liberation Army are also participating in the night school. The total number of attendees is more than 1,400. The teaching content of the Marxism-Leninism Night School's elementary class will focus on the "Common Knowledge Reader on Economic Construction"; the teaching content of the intermediate class will focus on Chapters Nine to Twelve of the "History of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union (Bolsheviks)". The training period is six months.

    In early April, the CPC Central Committee's Central South Bureau Directly Affiliated Organs Committee adjusted and selected the original theory instructors, hired lecturers for the Marxism-Leninism Night School, and carried out preparations such as reprinting textbooks and arranging courses. The responsible cadres of the CPC Central Committee's Central South Bureau attach great importance to this training work for theory instructors. In addition to Li Xuefeng, Second Deputy Secretary of the CPC Central Committee's Central South Bureau, serving as the principal of the Marxism-Leninism Night School, many leaders also serve as lecturers in the intermediate class of the Marxism-Leninism Night School.

    为加强在职干部理论学习的指导，中共中央中南局直属机关委员会正积极进行理论教员的培养训练工作。
    训练中级组和初级组理论教员的马克思列宁主义夜校已在五月二十五日开学。参加夜校学习的除中南局各直属机关的中级组和初级组理论教员外，还有湖北省、武汉市及中国人民解放军中南军区所属各机关的理论教员、学习辅导员等。总计参加听课的有一千四百多人。马克思列宁主义夜校初级班的讲授内容以“经济建设常识读本”为主；中级班的讲授内容以“联共（布）党史”第九章到第十二章为主。训练时间为半年。
    中共中央中南局直属机关委员会四月初就对原有的理论教员进行了调整和选拔工作，为马克思列宁主义夜校聘请了讲师；同时进行了翻印课本、编排课程等准备工作。中共中央中南局的负责干部对这次理论教员的培养训练工作极为重视，除中共中央中南局第二副书记李雪峰任马克思列宁主义夜校校长外，还有许多领导人担任了马克思列宁主义夜校中级班的讲师。（新华社）
