    When I was elected as a delegate
    Zhang Yizhi, Chief Engineer of Shanghai No. 2 State-owned Cotton Textile Factory
    Delegate to the Seventh National Congress of Chinese Trade Unions
    When I was elected as a delegate to the Seventh National Congress of Chinese Trade Unions, I had an indescribable feeling in my heart.
    I carefully reviewed the work I had done in the factory over the past few years: from initially not paying much attention to politics, harboring a purely technical viewpoint, and not understanding the creative power of the working masses, to gradually becoming aware, gradually realizing that old intellectuals and technicians must be thoroughly reformed, until I understood the principle of "technology must be combined with labor, and technicians must be combined with workers." During this period, the work I did was very little. Comparing this achievement with the honor that everyone has now given me, it makes me feel even more that I should contribute my technology better, completely put down the airs of the old society's engineers, closely unite with the working masses, and do a good job in production.
    In the previous period, our factory encountered a difficulty in production: there were many yarn breakages in the fine spinning workshop, which seriously affected quality and output. Many female workers complained that the work was difficult and felt distressed. After learning about this situation, in addition to trying to find solutions myself, I also organized a special research group, absorbing other technicians and experienced workers, to conduct research together. Everyone started by analyzing the reasons for the high number of yarn breakages, distinguishing the reasons belonging to the fine spinning workshop itself from the reasons belonging to other raw material supply workshops, and then trying to solve the problems separately according to the key points. As a result, based on the actual work experience of the workers and some principles I had learned, we improved the angles of the machine parts, the temperature of the workshop, and the operating methods, etc., and overcame the difficulty of excessive breakages. Since then, a central link problem has been solved in production, which has greatly improved both output and quality.
    Relying on the working masses, combining technical theory with the actual work experience of the workers, is the direction that the Party has repeatedly pointed out to us technicians. In the past, I only started to do some of this, and I achieved certain results. Today, after the Party's continuous education and the help and encouragement of the working masses, I am even clearer about this principle. I will always move in this direction, combining the technical theory I know with the practical experience of the workers, seeking continuous improvement between each other, and doing a good job in production. This is what I want to say when I attend this conference.

    当我被选为代表的时候
    国营上海第二棉纺织厂总工程师
    出席中国工会第七次全国代表大会代表  张一枝
    在我被选为出席中国工会第七次全国代表大会代表的时候，我心里有一种无法形容的感觉。
    我仔细地回顾几年来在厂子里所做的工作：从最初不大过问政治，存在着单纯技术观点，不懂得工人群众的创造力量，到自己逐渐有了觉悟，逐渐认识到旧知识分子、技术人员必须彻底改造，直至懂得了“技术必须与劳动相结合，技术人员必须与工人相结合”的道理。这一时期自己所作的工作成绩是很小的。拿这成绩和我现在大家给我的荣誉相比，就使我越发觉得，应该更好地把技术贡献出来，彻底放下旧社会工程师的那套架子，紧密地和工人群众在一起，搞好生产。
    前一个时期，我们厂生产上碰到了一个困难，精纺车间的细纱断头很多，严重影响了质量和产量。许多女工都反映活难做，感到很苦恼。我了解到这一情况后，除了自己想办法外，还组织了一个专门研究小组，吸收其他技术人员和有工作经验的工人，一起进行研究。大家从分析细纱断头多的原因出发，把属于精纺车间本身的原因和属于其他供给原料车间的原因，区别出来，然后分别针对着问题的关键来设法解决。结果根据工人实际工作的经验和自己学过一些原理，分别改进了机件上的角度，车间温度、操作方法等，克服了断头多的困难。从此在生产上解决了一个中心环节问题，使产量质量都大大提高一步。
    依靠工人群众，把技术理论和工人的实际工作经验结合起来，这是党一再指给我们技术人员的方向。我过去仅仅是开始这样做了一些，就取得了一定的成绩。今天经过党的不断教育和工人群众的帮助鼓励，对这一道理，我是更明确了。我永远要朝着这一方向前进，把自己知道的技术理论和工人的实际经验结合起来，求得互相之间的不断提高，搞好生产。这就是我参加这次大会要说的话。
