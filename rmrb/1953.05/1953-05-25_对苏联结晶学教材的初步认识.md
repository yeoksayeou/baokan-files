    Preliminary Understanding of Soviet Crystallography Textbooks
    Chen Guangyuan, Deputy Director of the Crystallography and Mineralogy Teaching and Research Section, Beijing Institute of Geology
    The first textbook we studied was "Crystallography" by Popov, a Soviet author. Superficially, it seemed that our spirit of learning from the Soviet Union was very good at that time, but in reality, our attitude was not upright enough. Many comrades, seeing that the Soviet textbooks did not entirely consist of "special" materials, and that they also cited English and American reference materials, and that some illustrations were even exactly the same as those published in English, American, German, and French textbooks, felt that the Soviet textbooks did not seem to be much different from those of capitalist countries. This shows that at that time, we lacked sufficient understanding of the ideological nature and the completeness of Soviet textbooks.
    Later, Soviet expert Comrade Galinin came. He gave demonstration lectures for our teaching and research section. At this time, although we had a preliminary understanding of the completeness of Soviet crystallography textbooks, we still did not have enough understanding of its purpose in teaching. Therefore, some comrades were only interested in certain "novel" materials. The most prominent example was that after the Soviet expert finished the first lecture, the questions we raised were not about textbook organization or teaching methods, but about the cleavage parallel to the rhombohedral faces. We argued with the Soviet expert about this question for half a day. After answering our questions, the Soviet expert clearly pointed out to us that this way of asking questions was divorced from the current teaching task. So we further examined our own thinking. After the start of the semester, comrades realized through teaching practice that their learning was not solid, and what they originally thought they understood was not really understood. At this time, we had a further appreciation of the many advantages of Soviet textbooks.
    Now, let's talk about our understanding of Soviet crystallography textbooks.
    First, we have realized that Soviet crystallography is a science based on dialectical materialism. It tells us that mankind lives in a material world. This material world is a crystalline world. Due to the development of human history and people's continuous practice, our understanding and utilization of the crystalline world has been continuously expanded and improved. In the early days of human history, our ancestors were attracted by the beautiful crystals in nature, grinding them into gems and using them as ornaments, or smelting useful ores in nature to make labor tools and weapons for self-defense. However, their utilization of objectively existing crystalline substances was limited to a very small range. Later, due to the development of social production and the gradual development of science, people began to understand the essence of crystalline substances and expanded the utilization of crystalline substances to the entire material world.
    This is a historical and dialectical process of development. People discovered crystals from mining and quarrying activities, and from the comparison of crystal shapes, they discovered the law of constancy of interfacial angles and the experimental formula that the number of crystal faces plus the number of solid angles is equal to the number of crystal edges plus two. These laws or formulas are reflections of objective laws and are found through practice. However, social production is constantly developing, so people's understanding will not only stay on the shape or surface phenomena. Russian scholar Lomonosov created the corpuscular theory, believing that the growth of crystals is the result of the sequential arrangement and accumulation of corpuscles. French scholar Haüy, because the small pieces obtained after crushing calcite still retained their original shape, speculated that the smallest structural unit of crystals was a parallelepiped. However, these experiences were not confirmed until the discovery of X-rays. The application of X-rays in crystal research is a higher stage of practice. Through this practice, people found new laws, namely the laws of the relationship between crystal structure and crystal shape and crystal properties. Due to the discovery of these many objective laws, people can further control crystal growth and utilize their different properties to serve mankind. Crystallography has developed to this point and has entered a higher stage of guiding practice. Soviet crystallography uses such materials to tell us the relationship between theory and practice, to tell us the movement and development of things, to teach us how to look at problems from a developmental perspective, and to teach us to become dialectical materialists and historical materialists. But the crystallography of capitalist countries is not like this. Dana's textbook in the United States spends two hundred pages describing the crystallography section, but does not mention the development of crystallography even once. A textbook written by Professor Phillips of Cambridge University in England based on his twenty years of teaching experience also has serious shortcomings.
    Second, Soviet textbooks can teach us to grasp the essence of things. Crystalline substances have a certain melting point and optical properties. They not only have anisotropy, but also have a certain crystal shape. But what laws govern these many phenomena? This requires touching on the essence of crystalline substances. Chairman Mao said: "When we look at things, we must resolutely look at their essence and regard their form as a guide to the door. Once we enter the door, we must grasp its essence—this is a reliable and scientifically sound analytical method that contains revolutionary significance." The analytical method used in Soviet crystallography textbooks is precisely such an analytical method. In the first chapter, it tells us the essence of crystalline substances, which is the regular network structure, also called the crystal lattice. This concept runs through the entire crystallography, explaining why crystals dissolve or regenerate, why some crystals are perfect and some are incomplete, and why large crystals have fewer faces and small crystals have more faces. On this series of issues, it not only makes us aware of the movement and development of matter, but also tells us that these many phenomena and facts are not accidental, nor are they unknowable. Their occurrence and existence reflect the objective laws of necessity. This is where it differs from idealistic textbooks. Idealists say: things are unknowable. Therefore, crystallography textbooks in capitalist countries often cannot solve essential problems, but only circle around the image, without being able to explain why.
    Third, Soviet textbooks also have an advantage: they progress from the shallow to the deep, from the simple to the complex. It is easy for teachers to teach and easy for students to learn. Crystallography textbooks in capitalist countries are just the opposite. For example, Dana starts with the isometric crystal system, and although Phillips starts with the triclinic crystal system, he does not divide the seven crystal systems into low, medium, and high levels of symmetry. Therefore, when students get the models, they do not know how the symmetry elements are combined into symmetry classes, nor do they know according to what rules the symmetry elements are combined. Although teachers have put in a lot of effort to explain, it is still difficult for students to understand. Some students do not even know what crystallography is at the end of the semester. After using Soviet textbooks, the teaching effect has been significantly improved. For example, after explaining the symmetry elements, students find when observing models that in models with a center of symmetry, the number of even-fold symmetry axes is equal to the number of symmetry planes. This illustrates two laws in symmetry theory: one is that the intersection of an even-fold symmetry axis and a symmetry plane perpendicular to it is a center of symmetry; the other is that there are n symmetry planes containing an n-fold symmetry axis, and there are also n two-fold axes perpendicular to the n-fold symmetry axis (at that time we had not yet begun to explain the six major laws in symmetry theory). From this, it can be seen how the logical reasoning and the characteristics of insight into the essence of things in Soviet textbooks cultivate students' ability to think independently and their spirit of research.
    Fourth, the editors of Soviet crystallography textbooks have adopted an extremely serious attitude towards the achievements of modern science. Soviet scientists certainly cherish the brilliant achievements of Soviet and Russian scholars in the field of science, but they do not obliterate even the slightest contributions of scientists from other countries. In the field of crystallography, they mentioned Lomonosov, Fedorov, Uliev, Fersman, and Belov, and also mentioned Steno of Denmark, Huygens of the Netherlands, Romé de l'Isle, Haüy, and Bravais of France, as well as Röntgen, Laue of Germany, and Bragg of England, and so on. This shows that Soviet scientists respect the achievements of their predecessors and accept all truths that reflect objective laws. Therefore, they can integrate, improve, and develop the scientific heritage of mankind in a spirit of seeking truth from facts. However, in textbooks in capitalist countries, Lomonosov, Fedorov, or Uliev have not been placed in appropriate positions; and the rotating stage invented by Fedorov is called the "universal stage" instead of the "Fedorov stage." But in the Soviet Union, scientists call the percentage value of the distribution of elements in the earth's crust the "Clark value" because Clark (USA) has made creative contributions in this regard.
    The above is only our preliminary understanding of Soviet crystallography textbooks. It is not an easy task to truly master this subject, and this depends on our continuous learning and hard work.

    对苏联结晶学教材的初步认识
    北京地质学院结晶矿物教研室副主任  陈光远
    我们最先学习的教材是苏联波波夫著的“结晶学”。从表面上看，当时我们学习苏联的精神好像很好，但是实际上我们的态度是不够端正的。不少同志看到苏联教材里所讲的不完全是“特殊”的材料，其中也有引用英美参考资料的地方，甚至有好些插图和英、美、德、法出版的教材完全相同，就觉得苏联教材似乎和资本主义国家的并没有什么差异。这就说明，当时我们对苏联教材的思想性以及苏联教材的完整性缺乏足够的认识。
    后来，苏联专家加里宁同志来了。他为我们教研室做了教学示范式的讲课。这时，虽然我们对苏联结晶学教材的完整性已经有了初步的认识，但是对它在教学上的目的性，仍然认识不够。因此，些有同志只对某些“新奇”的材料感到兴趣，最突出的例子是，当苏联专家讲完第一讲以后，我们所提出的问题，不是教材组织问题，也不是教学方法问题，而是平行于菱面体面的裂开问题。在这个问题上，我们跟苏联专家整整纠缠了半天。苏联专家在解答完了我们的问题以后，明确地向我们指出，这种提问题的方法，是脱离当前教学任务的。于是我们进一步检查了自己的思想。开学以后，同志们通过教学实践认识到自己的学习不踏实，原来自以为懂的，事实上并不真懂。这时，我们对苏联教材的许多好处才有了进一步的体会。
    现在，就来谈谈我们对苏联结晶学教材的认识。
    第一，我们体会到苏联的结晶学是一门以辩证唯物主义为基础的科学。它告诉我们：人类生活在一个物质的世界之中。这个物质世界是一个结晶世界，由于人类历史的发展以及人的不断的实践，我们对结晶世界的认识和利用遂不断地扩大提高。在人类历史的初期，我们的祖先被自然界美丽的晶体所吸引，把它磨成宝石，当做装饰品，或把自然界有用的矿石加以冶炼，做成劳动工具以及自卫的武器。但是他们对客观存在的结晶物质的利用，也只限于很小的范围。后来由于社会生产的发展以及科学的逐步发展，人们才开始认识结晶物质的本质，并且把结晶物质的利用扩大到整个的物质世界。
    这是一个历史辩证发展的过程。人们从开矿、采石头的活动中发现晶体，又从晶体外形的比较中发现面角恒等定律，以及晶面数加隅角数等于晶棱数加二的实验公式。这些定律或者公式是客观法则的反映，是通过实践找出来的。但是社会生产是在不断地发展，所以人们的认识不会只停留在外形或者表面现象上。俄罗斯学者罗曼诺索夫创立了微分子学说，他认为晶体的成长是微分子顺序排列推积的结果。法国的奥依，由于方解石敲碎以后所得到的小块外形仍然不变，因而推测晶体的最小构造单位是平行六面体。但是，这些经验直到滦琴射线发明以后才得到证实。滦琴射线在晶体研究上的应用，是一个更高的实践阶段。通过这一实践，人们找出了新的法则，即晶体构造和晶体外形以及晶体性质之间的关系的法则。由于这许多客观法则的发现，人们便可以进一步控制晶体生长，便可以利用它们的不同的性质来为人类服务。结晶学发展到这里，已经进入指导实践的更高级的阶段了。苏联的结晶学就是通过这样的材料告诉我们理论和实践的关系，告诉我们事物的运动和发展，告诉我们怎样从发展的观点去看问题，教我们成为一个辩证唯物主义和历史唯物主义者。但是资本主义国家的结晶学，却不是如此。美国丹纳的教科书，用二百页讲述了结晶学部分，但是连一个字也没有提到结晶学的发展。英国剑桥大学菲列普斯教授根据他二十多年的教学经验写出来的一本教科书，同样也有严重的缺点。
    第二，苏联教材能够教我们抓住事物的本质。结晶物质有一定的熔点和光学性质，它不但有异向性，它还有一定的晶形。但这许多现象是受什么法则支配的呢？这就要接触到结晶物质的本质问题了。毛主席说：“我们看事决然是要看它的实质，而把它的形式看做入门的向导，一进门就抓住它的实质——这才是科学的可靠的而且包含了革命意义的分析方法。”苏联结晶学教材所用的分析方法正是这样的分析方法。它在第一章里就告诉我们结晶物质的本质，那就是规律的网状构造，又叫做结晶格子。这一概念贯穿了整个的结晶学，说明了为什么晶体会溶解或者再生，为什么晶体有的完美有的残缺，为什么大晶体晶面少、小晶体晶面多。在这一系列的问题上，它一方面使我们认识了物质的运动发展，一方面又告诉我们那许多现象和事实不是偶然发生的，也不是不可知的，它的产生和存在正反映着客观的必然规律。这就是它和唯心主义的教材不同的地方。唯心主义者说：事物是不可知的。因此，资本主义国家的结晶学教材往往不能解决本质上的问题，只是在形象上兜圈子，说不出所以然来。
    第三，苏联教材还有一个优点：它由浅入深，由简单到复杂。教的人容易教，学的人容易学。资本主义国家的结晶学教材，恰恰相反，例如丹纳是从等轴晶系讲起的，菲列普斯虽然从三斜晶系讲起，可是他没有把七大晶系按对照程度分为低级、中级、高级。因此同学拿到模型，不知道对称因素是怎样组合成对称型的，也不知道对称因素是依什么规律组合的。教师虽然用了很大力气来讲解，同学们还是难以捉摸，有的同学甚至在学期终了时还不知道结晶学究竟是什么。用苏联教材以后，教学效果显著提高了。比如讲完对称因素以后，同学们在观察模型时，发现在有对称中心的模型中，偶次对称轴的和等于对称面数。这说明了对称学说里的两个定律：一个是，偶次对称轴和跟它垂直的对称面的交点是一个对称中心；另一个是，包含n次对称轴的对称面有n个，垂直于n次对称轴的二次轴也有n个（当时我们还没有开始讲对称学说中的六大定律）。由此可以看出，苏联教材逻辑的推理和洞察事物本质的特性，怎样培养了同学们的独立思考能力和钻研精神。
    第四，苏联结晶学教材的编者，对于近代科学上的成就采取了极为严肃的态度。苏联科学家固然珍贵苏联以及俄国学者在科学领域中的辉煌成就，但并不抹煞其他国家科学工作者一点一滴的贡献。在结晶学领域中，他们提到罗曼诺索夫、费多洛夫、乌里夫、费尔斯曼以及贝洛夫，也提到丹麦的斯坦诺，荷兰的惠根斯，法国的罗密德列尔、奥依、布拉威，还有德国的滦琴、劳埃、英国的布瑞格等等。这说明苏联科学家对前人劳动的成果是尊重的，他们接受一切反映客观法则的真理。因此他们才能以实事求是的精神把人类科学的遗产加以综合，加以提高，加以发展。然而在资本主义国家的教科书里，就没有把罗曼诺索夫、费多洛夫或者乌里夫放在适当的位置上；并且把费多洛夫所发明的旋转台叫作“万能台”，而不叫作费氏台。但在苏联，科学家们却把元素在地壳中分布的百分比值叫作“克拉克比值”，因为克拉克（美国）在这方面有创造性的功绩。
    以上只是我们对苏联结晶学教材的初步认识。要真正掌握这门学问不是一件轻易的事情，这有待于我们的不断学习和刻苦钻研。
