Xinhua News Agency, 18th: According to a report from Panmunjom by Wilfred Burchett, a reporter for the Paris newspaper "l'Humanité": The U.S. State Department recently issued a statement to defend the U.S. government's obstruction of the Korean armistice, in which it extravagantly talked about "humanitarian principles" and "individual personality and rights." The people who came out of the death camps on Geoje Island have given the best answer to this kind of deceitful talk. In the past three weeks, I have visited the returned sick and wounded Korean and Chinese personnel, who talked about the cruel retaliation suffered by the representatives sent to negotiate the conditions for the release of Dodd, the commander of the prisoner-of-war camp on Geoje Island, after he was detained by the captured personnel. People would be disgusted if they heard them narrate such incidents while simultaneously hearing the "humanitarian principles" spoken of by the U.S. government. And this incident is just one of many similar incidents.

The person who spoke with me was Captain Zhao Bingyu (transliteration) of the Korean People's Army. He had lived with the representatives dispatched by the captured personnel during the Dodd incident in the fourth camp of the first prisoner-of-war camp on Geoje Island for six months. He said that in May of last year, the captured personnel had to risk their lives to detain Dodd in order to safeguard their own rights and the rights of their comrades to be repatriated. After Dodd was detained, Dodd and Colson called representatives from other camps to a meeting place where Dodd was being held -- Camp 76 -- to discuss improving treatment. Dodd and his successor, Colson, even arranged for vehicles to transport them to the camp. The Geneva Convention expressly prohibits any persecution of the representatives elected by the prisoners of war to make demands on behalf of their comrades.

By the beginning of September last year, these twenty representatives were brought to the camp where Captain Zhao Bingyu was imprisoned. The captain told me that they were emaciated, and their faces and bodies were covered with bruises and bloodstains. He lived with them for six months, and when he was sent to the hospital in March of this year, he was repatriated along with other wounded and sick personnel due to an American mistake. He continued: "These representatives were imprisoned for three months in a special prison about one kilometer east of our camp. They were held separately in solitary confinement, and each person was subjected to two hours of whipping and torture every day. The rest of the time they hammered stones. For three months, they only wore underwear. There were no shirts, military uniforms, pants or shoes. They slept on the cement floor with a blanket, folding half of the blanket underneath as a sheet, and using the other half as a quilt. They ate two meals of moldy rice a day."

I asked what kind of torture they suffered. He said that in addition to being regularly beaten with bamboo sticks, there were two other types of torture: one was water torture, where they hung the representatives upside down in solitary confinement and then poured water into their nostrils; the other was electric shock torture.

These twenty representatives came from Camps 76, 77, 78, 66, 62, 85, and 92. In addition, Colonel Li Ke (transliteration), the representative of the Geoje Island prisoners of war, was held separately in a room and moved to Special Camp 8 in September. However, the captain had no opportunity to talk to him. Each camp was surrounded by two rows of electrified barbed wire. The entire prisoner-of-war camp was surrounded by double-layered barbed wire. The other camps in the camp held about 170 representatives selected from various prisoner-of-war camps who were considered by Syngman Rhee's agents to have led the struggle for the repatriation of all prisoners of war.

Captain Zhao Bingyu can explain to you the details of the electric shock torture inflicted by those "humanitarians." He had been subjected to the same punishments several times at the Far East Headquarters of the United Nations Command Military Police in Busan. He was taken to a soundproofed basement, where there were individual torture chambers and clinics to revive the victims when they lost consciousness. He said that after talking with those representatives, he found that the methods of torture were almost exactly the same as those used in the special camp on Geoje Island.

He said, "I was beaten with bamboo sticks and also subjected to water torture. When they tortured me half to death, they started using electric shock. They tied my hands behind my back, hung me on an iron chain with my feet off the ground, and then hung a heavy bucket of water around my neck, so my body was almost parallel to the ground. They wrapped electric wires around my left ankle and right wrist. When they turned the power on and off, my body swayed back and forth as if being hit by a sledgehammer. My head and body were crackling as if they were about to explode. My entire chest, head and body felt as if they were on fire. When they turned off the power, the American guards would ask me who the leaders of the underground organization in the camp were, and so on. Then the power would be turned on again. When I was about to die, they suddenly released the rope. My body hit the ground, the water in the bucket splashed on my face, and I came back to life. Then they repeated it again." He showed me his teeth, which were originally very good, but had become broken and incomplete due to contact with the edge of the water bucket and the cement floor. The representatives of the Dodd incident suffered this abuse for three months after being arrested on June 12. The interrogators always asked: "Who are the main instigators in your camp who oppose screening and oppose voluntary repatriation?" They asked the representatives of Camp 76: "Who ordered you to kidnap General Dodd? Who are the activists in your camp?" But for three months, they did not get any answers from these strong-willed people. So they locked them up in the prison of Camp 1, where they lived with those classified as "war criminals."

The actual torture was carried out by American military police. During the interrogation, Syngman Rhee elements were also present as translators. This is the true and precise definition of American "humanitarianism."

    揭露美方残酷虐待朝中被俘人员的真相
    【新华社十八日讯】据巴黎“人道报”记者贝却敌自板门店报道：美国国务院最近发表了替美国政府阻挠朝鲜停战作辩解的声明，它在声明中侈谈
    “人道原则”和“个人人格与权利”。对于这种欺人之谈，从巨济岛死亡营里出来的人们给了最好的答复。在过去三周中，我访问了被遣返回来的朝中病伤人员，他们谈到巨济岛上被俘人员扣留战俘营司令官杜德时、派往谈判释放杜德条件的代表们后来遭受残酷报复的事件。如果人们听了他们叙述的这种事件同时又听到美国政府所说的“人道原则”，他们一定会作呕的。而这种事件不过是许多类似事件中的一个。
    和我谈话的人是朝鲜人民军的被俘人员赵炳雨
    （译音）上尉。他曾经在巨济岛上第一号战俘营场的第四号营房里和杜德事件时被俘人员派遣的代表们一起住了六个月。他说，在去年五月，被俘人员为了保障他们自己的和他们同志们的被遣返的权利，不得不冒着生命的危险把杜德扣留起来。在杜德被扣后，杜德和柯尔生叫其他营场的代表们来到杜德被扣的处所——第七十六号营场开会，讨论改善待遇的问题。杜德和他的继任人柯尔生还安排了载运他们到营场来的车辆。日内瓦公约明文规定禁止对于战俘们选出的、替他们的同志提出要求的代表们进行任何迫害。
    到去年九月初，这二十个代表被带到赵炳雨上尉被囚的营房里。上尉告诉我说，他们骨瘦如柴，脸上和身上被打得青一块，紫一块，血痕斑斑。他和他们在一起住了六个月，到今年三月，送到医院时，由于美国人弄错了，他和其他伤病人员一道被遣返了。他继续说：“这些代表们在我们营场东面约一公里的特别牢狱里囚禁了三个月。他们被分开关在禁闭室内，每一个人每天受两小时的鞭打和苦刑。其余的时间他们就捶石头。有三个月的时间他们只穿一条衬裤。没有衬衣、军服、裤子或鞋子。他们带一床毯子睡在洋灰地上，把毯子一半折在下面当床单，另一半就作为被子。每天吃两顿发了霉的饭。”
    我问他们受的是那一类的苦刑。他说，除了经常用竹棍打以外，还有两种苦刑：一种是水刑，他们把代表们倒吊在禁闭室里，然后用水从鼻孔里灌进去；另外一种是电刑。
    这二十个代表是从七十六号、七十七号、七十八号、六十六号、六十二号、八十五号和九十二号营场来的。此外，巨济岛战俘的代表李克（译音）上校被分开关在一间房子里，并于九月间被移到第八号特别营房。但是上尉没有机会和他谈话。每一个营房周围有两排通了电流的铁丝网。整个战俘营用双层铁丝网围着。营场的其他营房中关着从各战俘营挑出来的一百七十名左右被李承晚特务认为曾领导争取全部战俘遣返的斗争的代表。
    赵炳雨上尉可以向你们说明那些“人道主义者们”所施的电刑的详情。他曾经在釜山联合国军司令部远东宪兵总部受过几次同样的刑罚。他被带到一间不传声的地下室，在那里有单人受刑室和在受难者失掉知觉时使他苏醒过来的诊疗室。他说，与那些代表们一交谈，他发现施刑的方法与巨济岛上的特别营房所用的方法几乎完全一样。
    他说，我被竹棍打过，也受过水刑。他们把我折磨得半死的时候就开始用电刑。他们把我的手反捆着，脚不着地地吊在铁索上，然后把重重的一桶水挂在我的颈子上，于是我的身体差不多与地面平行了。他们把我的左脚踝和右手腕缠上电线。当他们把电门一开一关的时候，我的身体就前后摇摆，好像被大铁锤打的一样。我的头和全身都喳喳地响着，仿佛要爆炸了。整个的胸部、头部和身体都好像着了火似的。当他们把电门关上时，美国卫兵就问我营场地下组织的领袖是谁等等。然后电门又开了。当我快要死时，他们忽然放下索子。我的身体着了地，桶里的水泼在我的脸上，我又活转来了。然后他们又重复一次。他露出牙齿给我看，这一排本来是很好的牙齿，由于和水桶边及洋灰地接触，已经残缺不全了。杜德事件的代表们自六月十二日被捕后，遭受这种虐待达三月之久。审问者总是这样问：“你们的营场里谁是反对甄别、反对自愿遣返的主要鼓动者？”他们问七十六号营场的代表们：“谁命令你们绑架杜德准将？谁是你们营场的活动分子？”但是在三个月之中，他们并没有从这些意志刚强的人们这里得到任何回答。于是他们就把他们关进第一号营场的牢房里，和那些被列入“战犯”类的人住在一起。
    实际的苦刑都是由美国宪兵施行的。在审问时还有李承晚分子在他们身边当翻译。这就是美国“人道主义”的真正的、确切的定义。
