    Celebrating "June 1st" International Children's Day
    Central Ministry of Health Directs Strengthening of Child Health Work

    The Central People's Government Ministry of Health, in celebration of "June 1st" International Children's Day, issued instructions on May 9th to health and medical institutions across the country regarding the strengthening of child health work, putting forward the following four points for future work:

    1.  Health departments at all levels should unite with relevant local departments and people's organizations, and make every effort to mobilize practicing medical personnel to vigorously promote new methods of childbirth to reduce tetanus neonatorum; universally carry out publicity and education on childcare knowledge, children's hygiene, family hygiene, and family care, mainly aimed at preventing acute infectious diseases and common diseases of children, and can adopt small-scale mobile or large-scale exhibitions, children's meetings, forums for parents or childcare workers, and various promotional methods for publicity and education; combined with the patriotic health campaign, to make the work of protecting children's health more broadly popular.

    2.  Carry out targeted child health checkups. Focus on scattered children under the age of seven in factory and mining areas and suburban areas, and children in rural busy season childcare organizations. After discovering shortcomings, efforts should be made to correct them as much as possible. At the same time, publicity and education should be carried out in conjunction with real people and real events. More importantly, based on actual conditions, point out simple and easy-to-implement improvement methods. In health checkups, investigate and understand the good and bad typical cases of old childcare methods and the general state of children's hygiene in the local area, in order to conduct further research and improvement. To carry out this work, the location should be carefully selected in advance, the staff should be carefully organized to deeply understand the situation, and special attention should be paid to avoid hindering industrial and agricultural production.

    3.  It is imperative to gradually transform children's health work from a blitz-style campaign into a planned and systematic regular work. Health departments in various localities should not regard celebrating Children's Day and carrying out children's health campaigns as a mere blitz task, but should correct the shortcomings discovered during health checkups in a planned and systematic manner, as much as possible according to urgency. At the same time, every season should focus on children's infectious diseases and common diseases, and promptly carry out preventive publicity and education.

    4.  Health departments in various localities should regularly provide business guidance on child health to childcare organizations in various regions. The medical subsidies for rural busy season childcare organizations need to be effectively used to help them purchase common and commonly used health and medical materials, be responsible for teaching childcare workers how to use them, and conduct supervision and inspection at any time.

    庆祝“六一”国际儿童节
    中央卫生部指示加强儿童保健工作
    中央人民政府卫生部为庆祝“六一”国际儿童节，五月九日向全国各地卫生医疗机构发出关于加强儿童保健工作的指示，提出今后的四点工作：
    一、各级卫生部门应联合当地各有关部门和人民团体，并尽量发动开业的医务人员，大力宣传新法接生，以减少初生儿的破伤风；普遍展开育儿知识、儿童卫生、家庭卫生及家庭护理等宣传教育，主要以预防儿童急性传染病和多发病为目的，可采取小型流动性的或大型的展览会、儿童会、家长或保育人员的座谈会及各种宣传方式进行宣传教育；结合爱国卫生运动，使保卫儿童健康的工作更具有广泛的群众性。
    二、有重点地进行儿童健康检查。以厂矿区、市郊区的七岁以下的散居儿童和农忙托儿组织内的儿童为主要检查对象，发现缺点后应尽可能予以矫治，同时要结合真人真事进行宣传教育。更重要的是根据实际条件，指出简单易行的改进办法。在健康检查中，调查了解当地旧育儿法的好坏典型事例及一般的儿童卫生状况，以便作进一步的研究、提高。进行这一工作，应事先择定地点，认真组织工作人员深入了解情况，并切实注意不要妨碍工农业生产。
    三、必须将儿童保健工作从突击性的运动逐渐转变为有计划有步骤的经常性工作。各地卫生部门不应把庆祝儿童节开展儿童保健运动单纯看作突击任务，而应有计划有步骤地将健康检查时所发现的缺点，尽可能分别缓急予以矫治。同时，各个季节都要针对儿童的传染病和多发病，及时展开预防性的宣传教育。
    四、各地卫生部门对各地区的托儿组织，要定期给以儿童保健的业务指导。农忙托儿组织的医药补助费，需切实帮助其购置普通常用的卫生医疗材料，负责向保育人员教会使用方法，并随时进行督促检查。（新华社）
