    Xinhua News Agency, Tokyo, 27th: It is reported from Tokyo that former U.S. Assistant Secretary of State for Far Eastern Affairs Allison, who succeeded Murphy as the new U.S. Ambassador to Japan, arrived in Tokyo on the 23rd. It is understood that Allison's main task is to intensify the drive for the Yoshida government to rearm Japan.
    Allison was a key aide to Dulles in drafting the enslaving San Francisco unilateral peace treaty with Japan and the "U.S.-Japan Security Treaty." He has consistently and publicly advocated that Japan "must intensify its rearmament" and participate in the Pacific aggressive bloc. When Allison visited Japan in November last year after visiting Southeast Asian countries to organize the Pacific aggressive bloc, he ordered the Yoshida government to take "stronger defense measures" regardless of the consequences. The day after Eisenhower asked the U.S. Senate on March 6th to approve Allison as the new U.S. Ambassador to Japan, "authoritative sources in Tokyo" revealed that Allison was appointed as Ambassador to Japan in order to "promote Eisenhower's new policy towards anti-communist camps in Far Eastern Asian countries." Subsequently, the U.S. government announced that it would help Japan rearm with "aid" from the "Mutual Security Agency." Foreign Minister Katsuo Okazaki of the Yoshida government stated on the 12th that he would formally begin negotiations on the U.S. "aid" issue after Allison's arrival. According to the Japanese bourgeois newspaper "Yomiuri Shimbun," at the negotiation meetings, "Allison will demand that Japan increase the strength of its Security Forces and improve military facilities in Japan as conditions for receiving aid under the Mutual Security Program."

    美新任驻日大使艾利逊抵日
    企图加紧驱使日本重新武装
    【新华社二十七日讯】东京消息：接替墨菲继任美国驻日大使的前美国负责远东事务的助理国务卿艾利逊，已在二十三日到达东京。据悉，艾利逊的主要任务，是加紧驱使吉田政府重新武装日本。
    艾利逊是协助杜勒斯草拟奴役日本的旧金山片面对日和约与“美日安全条约”的主要助手，他一贯公开鼓吹日本“必须加紧进行重整军备”并参加太平洋侵略集团。艾利逊在去年十一月间为组织太平洋侵略集团遍访东南亚各国之后到日本时，就曾责令吉田政府不顾一切后果采取“更强有力的防御措施”。在艾森豪威尔于三月六日要求美国参议院批准艾利逊为美国驻日新大使的第二天，“东京权威人士”就透露，艾利逊被任命为驻日大使，是为了“推动艾森豪威尔对远东亚洲国家的反共阵营的新政策”。接着，美国政府并宣布将以“共同安全署”的“援助”帮助日本重新武装。吉田政府的外相冈崎胜男在十二日表示将在艾利逊到任后就美国“援助”问题正式开始谈判。据日本资产阶级的报纸“读卖新闻”透露：在谈判的会议上，“艾利逊将要求日本增加保安队的力量并改进在日本的军事设施，作为接受共同安全计划援助的条件”。
