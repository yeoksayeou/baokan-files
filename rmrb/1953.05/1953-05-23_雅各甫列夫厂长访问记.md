    A Visit with Factory Director Yakovlev
    By Our Correspondent in Moscow, Li He

    One recent afternoon, at the pre-arranged time, I met Comrade Yakov Petrovich Yakovlev, director of the "Moskvich" automobile factory, in his office.

    Portraits of Lenin, Stalin, and Malenkov hung on three walls of the office. The room contained the factory director's desk, a long table for meetings, a safe, and some chairs. In the outer room, a technical secretary was working. Everything was the same as in the offices of responsible comrades in general Soviet agencies and enterprises. But to the right of the factory director's desk, there was an additional automatic switchboard. When I entered the office, Comrade Yakovlev was toggling the switches on this automatic device, smaller than a desk, and speaking directly to the workshops. Through this switchboard, he could talk simultaneously to all the workshops, or individually to a specific workshop, without using an intercom.

    Comrade Yakovlev is a robust man in his forties. When I asked my questions, he spoke eloquently. He spoke with such substance and organization that I felt as if I were facing a learned expert; he was so willing to instruct that I felt as if I had met an enthusiastic friend. He spoke to me tirelessly for three hours, without stopping except for a few calls to the workshops.

    How Production Plans are Formulated

    Comrade Yakovlev talked about how the "Moskvich" automobile factory formulates its annual production plan.

    Initially, the Ministry of Industry (or its administrative bureau) provides the factory with control figures, based on the state's need for the "Moskvich" automobile factory's products. After receiving these control figures, the factory leadership issues directives instructing all subordinate departments and workshops to study issues related to achieving these control figures, prepare necessary recommendations and methods, and specify a deadline for submission.

    Upon receiving the directives, the workshop leadership – the workshop director, the director of the workshop's technical department, the directors of the workshop's various sections, and the foremen – discuss the directives together. For example, when the engine workshop discusses annual output, they study the workshop's weaker links and methods of overcoming them, as well as new technical procedures, thus generating the workshop's plan to guarantee the fulfillment of the control figures.

    After the workshop leadership formulates the basic plan and implementation methods, it submits them to the workshop production meeting for discussion. Advanced workers, technicians, and general workers participate in the discussion. They often raise important supplements and many rationalization proposals. These rationalization proposals allow the workshop to greatly increase output without expending much effort. All workshops conduct discussions in this way. These discussions generally begin half a year before the plan is finalized; for example, next year's plan will be discussed in June and July of this year.

    After the workshop production meetings, the workshops formulate plans containing specific suggestions and send them to the factory leadership. The factory leadership synthesizes these specific suggestions from each workshop to formulate the factory's application plan. This application plan specifies the factory's product output and categories, as well as the factory's requests to the Ministry of Industry in order to ensure the fulfillment of the control figures, and is submitted to the Ministry of Industry.

    The Ministry of Industry reviews the factory's application plan to coordinate with the state's overall plan. The Ministry of Industry may revise the factory's application plan during its review. After review and revision, the Ministry of Industry formulates the final mandatory control figures and hands them over to the factory. The factory formulates a reporting plan based on these final mandatory control figures, including economic and technical indicators such as labor costs and labor consumption. The factory can also offer its own opinions when formulating the reporting plan. For example, if the factory determines, after accurate calculation, that some of the mandatory control figures cannot be met, it can raise its concerns, but generally the opinions of the higher and lower levels are consistent. The final mandatory figures are always achieved through very intensive work. The main ways to ensure completion rely on increasing labor productivity and advanced technology. The reporting plan is reviewed by the various departments of the Ministry of Industry, approved by the Minister, and issued at the end of the year.

    After receiving the approved reporting plan, the factory leadership issues tasks—orders—to the workshops based on the quarterly plans contained within it. These tasks—orders—are issued to the workshops three days to a week before the start of each quarter. This task—order, formulated by the factory's planning department and approved by the factory director, includes three aspects: output, categories, and labor plan. The workshops then formulate their own economic plans based on this task—order and submit them to the factory director for approval. In addition to output, categories, and labor plan, the workshop's economic plan also includes a budget for production costs and product costs.

    Yakovlev's talk made me realize: (1) Soviet enterprises thoroughly follow the mass line when formulating annual production plans. A plan takes half a year, repeatedly discussed, studied, enriched, and concretized from top to bottom and from bottom to top, combining the wisdom of the leadership with the wisdom of the masses, transforming the plan from a well-intentioned wish of the leadership into a practical action program of the masses themselves. This is the main guarantee that Soviet enterprises' production plans can be completed on time or ahead of schedule. (2) Soviet enterprises' production plans are formulated according to the most demanding tasks assigned by higher authorities, not based on conservative, suppressed figures. This forces all enterprise personnel to fully utilize their wisdom and strive to tap potential forces in economic and technical aspects to ensure the completion of the plan.

    How to Ensure Plan Implementation

    After the production plan is implemented, how do you ensure its completion? Besides organizing socialist emulation, what other methods are there? Comrade Yakovlev spoke about the experience of the "Moskvich" automobile factory in three important aspects: checking the plan, implementing the economic accounting system, and improving product quality.

    (1) Each workshop of the "Moskvich" automobile factory reports to the factory director daily on the completion of the 24-hour production plan. The factory director convenes a scheduling meeting limited to one hour every morning to check the work of each workshop and department in the factory and issue new instructions. The workshop directors and department directors all participate in the scheduling meeting. If a workshop has not completed yesterday's work, the reasons are immediately identified at the meeting, and effective corrective measures are taken. The scheduling meeting maintains a high sense of responsibility among the workshop directors, ensuring that the entire factory works rhythmically day and night according to the instructions and charts. This is a daily check, mainly checking the completion of output and categories. Other production indicators, such as labor and costs, are checked monthly.

    (2) As mentioned above, each workshop of the "Moskvich" automobile factory has an economic plan, including output, categories, labor plan, production costs, and cost budget. At the end of each month, each workshop prepares a report on the results of the workshop's economic accounting and costs, along with a cost account report for the total output of each product. Based on these reports, the factory's economic accounting committee prepares a general report on the economic accounting of all product categories, which is submitted to the factory director by the director of the factory's economic department. The factory's economic accounting committee includes the director of the economic department, the chief accountant, the director of the labor and wages department, the chief engineer, the director of the technical inspection department, and the director of the finance department. The chief power engineer, chief mechanic, or any department head can be invited to participate when necessary. On the workshop side, the participants include the workshop director, accountant, head of the planning and economics section, head of the labor and wages section, and technicians and power engineers when necessary. The economic accounting committee regularly holds lively discussions on the issue of reducing costs. If a workshop reduces costs, it is rewarded according to regulations. This encourages each workshop to implement the economic accounting system.

    Based on the workshop's economic plan, the sections and work teams in the factory have their own economic plans, which include output, labor, and costs. The sections and work teams report to the workshop daily on the quantity and category of products completed, and monthly on the completion of each production indicator.

    The factory implements the economic plan down to each workstation. Individual accounts are set up for each worker to record their production progress—how many pieces of work are completed within how many hours. The account includes three figures: task, guaranteed to be done, and actually done. Here, each worker not only guarantees the amount of the plan to be completed, but also guarantees the amount of raw materials and tools to be saved. In 1952, the factory saved 5 million rubles due to the implementation of the workshop economic accounting system, of which 2.7 million rubles were saved due to the establishment of individual accounts.

    (3) The "Moskvich" automobile factory has done a lot of work to improve product quality. The factory has a technical inspection department, which implements all aspects of product quality inspection. Workers throughout the factory also strive to produce superior quality products. The factory leadership also uses the following series of measures to improve product quality:

    (1) Constantly improve the skills of workers, foremen, and responsible personnel in each workshop and department – improving the technical level of all employees. The factory organizes various training classes and Stakhanov schools for workers, and a branch of the secondary technical school for automotive mechanics for foremen. The main way to improve product quality is to constantly educate workers and improve their technical level. To educate workers, the factory has an education plan and allocates a special fund. In addition, the factory regularly checks workers' skills, checks their knowledge of the operations of their department, and checks whether their operations are correct. This is checked by the factory's technical education department and the engineers in charge of technical education in the workshop. For new and inexperienced workers, they are guided and educated in all aspects; because the production process is continuous, the quality of one worker's work affects the whole. The staff of the technical inspection department are also organized into specialized training classes for education, and their knowledge is checked to ensure that they are competent to inspect products.

    (2) Regularly check the technical procedures followed in each workshop. This is checked by the factory's chief engineer department and the director of the workshop's technical department. Check whether the order of operations is correct, whether the tools used are appropriate, etc. In addition to labor discipline, the factory has a discipline for following technical procedures. Technical procedures are the basis for correctly organizing production and an important factor in ensuring the production of superior quality products.

    (3) Regularly check the accuracy of the equipment, especially the equipment used for final processing. Because maintaining the accuracy of the equipment is a prerequisite for reducing defective products.

    (4) Implement the rationalization proposals of workers and technicians, implement partial improvements to technical procedures, and promote new technical procedures. If all the rationalization proposals of workers and technicians in this factory in 1952 were implemented, 6.5 million rubles could be saved.

    (5) Improve the structure of products. The factory has a chief designer department, which is responsible for studying issues related to improving the structure of automobiles, researching and experimenting with new parts and components of automobiles, and adopting successful ones into the factory's production. This often greatly improves the quality of automobiles. For example, in 1952, cast iron sleeves were installed on the automatic closures on the cylinder head, and chromium piston rings were used instead, resulting in the engine life of automobiles being extended from 35,000 kilometers of travel to 50,000 to 60,000 kilometers of travel.

    How to Be a Factory Director

    In Comrade Yakovlev's conversation, I realized that he was an experienced factory director, so I asked him to talk about how he became a factory director. At my insistence, Comrade Yakovlev satisfied my request, but he repeatedly humbly stated that what he was talking about was only his own limited experience, for reference only.

    Comrade Yakovlev first talked about the basis of leadership art. He said: "In order to ensure the success of the work, it is necessary to rely on the masses, first of all, on the advanced part - the Party organization. It is necessary to learn from the masses - that is, to strive for the opinions of workers, foremen, and workshop directors. The reason why the 'Moskvich' automobile factory can quickly complete its tasks is because it relies on the enormous creative power - the masses. Comrade Stalin said: the plan is living people, this is us and you. This is the basis of leadership work. The correct path is: to educate all employees, and to learn from all employees ourselves."

    Comrade Yakovlev then talked about three points of experience.

    First, the factory director must be very familiar with the business. This is the only way to solve the problems raised by various departments and solve them correctly. Comrade Yakovlev is not satisfied with the higher education he received in the past, but constantly improves his ideological, political, and professional level; because Soviet technology is progressing very fast, if a leader does not improve himself, he will fall behind. He pays attention to studying all the advanced experiences of factories in the same industry and applying them to his own factory. Especially in mastering advanced technical procedures, he believes that the factory director should take the lead.

    Second, the factory director must maintain close contact with the workshop directors and department directors. Comrade Yakovlev often goes to the workshops to talk to the workshop directors about workshop production issues. He often participates in workshop production meetings and Party meetings to discuss important issues. This constant contact allows him to understand the actual situation in the workshops, so that he can correctly solve problems and correct errors in a timely manner. He often convenes the directors of each workshop and department and relevant personnel to discuss specialized issues; for example, to discuss the quality issues of parts produced by a certain workshop, he first listens to the opinions of the technical inspection department, and informs the people attending the meeting of the issues to be discussed a week before the meeting.

    Third, the factory director must thoroughly check the work. Comrade Yakovlev himself presides over the scheduling meeting every morning to check yesterday's work. He issues instructions based on the materials and suggestions provided by each production department; for example, if a certain workshop did not complete its work yesterday, then it is instructed to do more today. Comrade Yakovlev also regularly personally checks the implementation of the factory's first order. This is the tradition of the "Moskvich" automobile factory: to issue the first order at the end of the previous year or the beginning of the current year, which points out all the basic measures that the factory will take this year, such as improving quality, reducing defective products, and so on.

    To get a more concrete understanding of Comrade Yakovlev's work situation, I asked him to talk about how he spends his day.

    Comrade Yakovlev arrives at the factory at 8:30 every morning. He first reads the report on the completion of the work from the factory's person on duty. Then he inspects two or three workshops to check some issues in the work. He convenes a scheduling meeting from 10:00 to 11:00. He eats breakfast at twelve o'clock. While eating breakfast, he and the factory Party committee discuss matters for ten to twenty minutes - about yesterday's and today's work situation and problems. From 2:00 to 4:00 in the afternoon, he holds a thematic meeting for one and a half to two hours (this type of meeting is held regularly, but not every day). He attends a district Party committee meeting, a state Party committee meeting, or a city Soviet meeting once a week. He receives workers once a week to solve their personal problems (sometimes also solving work problems such as rationalization proposals), talking to two or thirty people at a time, all of whom have registered in advance. The time is from 4:00 to 6:00 in the afternoon. He often goes to the Moscow Stalin Automobile Factory, almost once a week, to absorb all the advanced experiences there. He also often goes to the Gorky City Molotov Automobile Factory, although it is far away, and has been there dozens of times. In addition to work, he also studies. He recently studied the documents of the 19th National Congress of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union, Stalin's "Economic Problems of Socialism in the USSR," and led a group studying the documents of the 19th National Congress of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union. He often gives reports at the factory's Stakhanov workers' meetings and Party and administrative activists' meetings.

    From Worker to Factory Director

    Yakovlev finally talked about his background.

    He was born into a worker's family. His father was a fitter, an old Party member, who passed away in 1952. Because there were many children, his father sent him to work as a worker after he finished seventh grade. He worked as a porter for three years, and from 1925 to 1935, he was a member of the Communist Youth League. After studying in a university preparatory class for a year without leaving his production post, he entered the Moscow Mining University in 1929 and graduated in 1934, becoming a mechanical engineer. Then he went to the factory and worked as a workshop director, factory chief engineer, and administrative bureau chief engineer. He has been serving in the "Moskvich" automobile factory for ten years - serving as deputy factory director for seven years and factory director for three years. He joined the Communist Party of the Soviet Union in 1940. He was elected as a member of the factory Party committee, a member of the district Party committee, a representative of the city Soviet, and a member of the state Party supervision committee.

    Comrade Yakovlev's background as a worker is not uncommon in the Soviet Union, just like his rich experience. In the Soviet Union, many factory directors and even ministers were originally ordinary workers, who, due to the good conditions provided by the socialist society and their own hard work, finally took on more important work in society.

    Finally, when I stood up to say goodbye and thanked my host for his enthusiastic explanation, Comrade Yakovlev shook my hand tightly. He said: It is the duty of Soviet people to introduce their own experiences to the Chinese people. As long as this experience is of some help to the construction of the new China, it is a great pleasure. The Soviet Union relied entirely on its own arduous exploration at the beginning of its construction. Now that China has the Soviet Union as an example, the Chinese people who love labor will surely be able to build a strong country more quickly.

    I admired Comrade Yakovlev's spirit of internationalism, and with the same belief in our country's construction as Comrade Yakovlev, I left the "Moskvich" automobile factory.

    May 10th in Moscow

    雅各甫列夫厂长访问记
    本报驻莫斯科记者  李何
    最近的一个下午，按照预先约好的时间，在“莫斯科人”汽车工厂厂长办公室，我见了厂长雅各甫·彼特罗维奇·雅各甫列夫同志。
    办公室的三面墙上挂着列宁、斯大林、马林科夫的像。室内放着厂长办公桌、开会用的长桌、保险箱和一些椅子。室外房间有一个技术秘书在工作着。一切和苏联一般机关和企业的负责同志的办公室一样。但是在厂长办公桌的右手，多一个自动调度台。我进办公室时，雅各甫列夫同志正拨动这个比书桌还小的自动装置上的开关，直接和车间通话。通过这个调度台，他不用传话筒就可以同时同各个车间通话，也可以单独同某一个车间通话。
    雅各甫列夫同志是一个四十多岁、身材魁梧的人。当我提出问题后，他滔滔不绝地谈着。他谈得这样有内容有条理，使我觉得好像面对着一位饱学的专家；他这样肯教益，使我觉得像遇到了热心的朋友一样。他毫无倦容地对我谈了三个钟头，除了几次和车间通话以外，中间没有停顿过。
    怎样制订生产计划
    雅各甫列夫同志谈了“莫斯科人”汽车工厂是怎样制订一年生产计划的。
    最初，工业部（或工业部的管理局）根据国家对“莫斯科人”汽车工厂产品的需要，给这个工厂以控制数字。工厂领导方面得到这个控制数字以后，就发布指令，责成所属的各个部门和各个车间研究有关实现这个控制数字的问题，责成他们准备必要的建议和办法，并且限定缴报的时间。
    车间得到指令以后，车间领导方面——车间主任、车间技术部主任、车间各分部主任、各领班长一起讨论这个指令。例如：发动机车间在讨论一年出产量时，研究这个车间的较弱环节和克服的办法，也研究新的技术手续，这样产生了这个车间保证完成控制数字的计划。
    车间领导方面制订出基本的计划和实施办法以后，把它提交车间生产会议去讨论。参加讨论的有先进工人、技术人员和一般工人。他们常常提出重要的补充和许多合理化建议。这些合理化建议使得车间不用花费很多气力就可以大大增加产量。所有车间都这样进行讨论。这种讨论一般在计划制成的半年以前开始，例如在今年的六七月间就讨论明年的计划。
    在车间生产会议讨论以后，车间制订出包含有具体建议的计划，把它送给工厂领导方面。工厂领导方面综合各车间这些具体建议，制订出全厂的申请计划。这个申请计划写明工厂产品的产量和品类，也写明工厂为着保证完成控制数字对工业部的要求，呈报到工业部去。
    工业部审查工厂的申请计划，以配合国家的整个计划。工业部在研究工厂的申请计划时候，可以修正。经过审查和修正后，工业部制订出最后的必须完成的控制数字，交给工厂。工厂根据最后的必须完成的控制数字，制订出复报计划，包括劳动成本、劳动消耗量等等经济和技术的指标。在制订复报计划时，工厂还可以提出自己意见。譬如工厂在精确地计算以后，确定有些必须完成的控制数字不可能完成时，可以提出意见，但上下意见一般都是一致的。最后的必须完成的数字，都是要很紧张的工作才能完成的。保证完成的办法，主要依靠提高劳动生产率和高度的技术。复报计划由工业部的各部门审查，由部长批准，在年底发下。
    工厂领导方面在接到被批准的复报计划以后，根据其中的每季计划，向车间提出任务——订货。这种任务——订货在每季开始前三天到一星期发给车间。这个由工厂计划部制订，经厂长批准的任务——订货，包括产量、品类、劳动计划三个方面。然后车间根据这个任务——订货，再制订出车间的经济计划，送交厂长批准。车间的经济计划除了产量、品类、劳动计划以外，还包括生产费用和产品成本的预算。
    雅各甫列夫的谈话使我领会到了：（一）苏联企业在制订每年生产计划时是彻底走群众路线的。一个计划用半年时间，从上而下又从下而上地反复讨论、研究、充实、具体化，使领导方面的智慧和群众方面的智慧结合起来，使计划不停留为领导方面的善意愿望，而变成为切合实际的、群众自己的行动纲领。这就是苏联各企业的生产计划能够按期完成或提前完成的主要保证。（二）苏联企业的生产计划是按照上级所交给的最紧张的任务来制订，它不是建立在保守的压低的数字上。这样促使企业全体人员必须充分地发挥智慧，努力挖掘经济和技术方面潜在的力量，以保证计划的完成。
    怎样保证计划的实现
    生产计划实施以后，怎样保证它的完成呢？除了组织社会主义竞赛以外，还有什么方法呢？雅各甫列夫同志谈到了“莫斯科人”汽车工厂在检查计划、贯彻经济核算制和改进产品质量这三个重要方面的经验。
    （一）“莫斯科人”汽车工厂各车间每天向厂长汇报一昼夜生产计划完成的情形。厂长每天上午召开一小时为限的调度会议，检查全厂各车间和各部的工作，发出新的指示。各车间主任和各部主任都参加调度会议。那一个车间没有完成昨天的工作，在会上立刻找出原因，采取有效的纠正办法。调度会议使各车间主任保持着高度的责任心，保证全厂昼夜按指示图表有节奏地工作。这是每天的检查，主要是检查产量和品类的完成情形。对于其他方面的生产指标，像劳动、成本等等则按月检查。
    （二）像上面所说的，“莫斯科人”汽车工厂各车间都有经济计划，计划中包括产量、品类、劳动计划，生产费用和成本的预算等项。每月月终，各车间作出了车间经济核算的结果和成本的报告，并附以每种产品的总产量的成本账目报告。工厂经济核算委员会根据这些报告，作出了所有品类产品的经济核算总报告，由工厂经济部主任送交厂长。参加工厂经济核算委员会的有：经济部主任、总会计、劳动与工资部主任、总技师、技术检查部主任、财务部主任，必要时可以邀请总动力师、总机械师或任何部门的负责人参加。车间方面参加的有：车间主任、会计、计划与经济科科长、劳动与工资科科长，必要时还有技师和动力师参加。在经济核算委员会上经常热烈讨论减低成本问题。那一个车间减低了成本，就根据规章奖励它。这样鼓励每个车间实行经济核算制。
    工厂的各车间的分部和工段根据车间经济计划，订有分部和工段的经济计划，这种计划包括产量、劳动、成本等项。分部和工段向车间每天报告产品的数量和品类完成的情形，每月报告各个生产指标完成的情形。
    工厂把经济计划贯彻到每个工作地。每个工人都设立个人账户，用以登记他生产的进度——多少小时以内完成了多少件活。账户包括三项数字：任务、保证做到的、实际做到的。这里，每个工人不仅保证完成计划多少，而且保证节约原料和工具多少。这个工厂在一九五二年由于实行车间经济核算制，节约了五百万卢布，其中二百七十万卢布是因为设立个人账户而节约的。
    （三）“莫斯科人”汽车工厂对于改进产品质量做了很多工作，工厂设有技术检查部，它对产品质量实行各方面的检查。全厂工人也都努力于生产优等质量的产品。工厂领导方面还采用如下的一系列办法来改进产品的质量：
    （1）经常提高工人、领班、各车间各部门负责人员的熟练程度，——提高全体职工的技术水平。工厂里为工人组织有各种训练班、斯大哈诺夫学校，为领班设有汽车机械师中等技术学校分校。改进产品质量的主要办法是经常不断地教育工人，提高他们的技术水平。为了教育工人，工厂订有教育计划，并拨出一笔专门经费。此外，工厂经常地检查工人的熟练程度，检查他们对本部门操作的知识，检查他们的操作是否正确。由工厂技术教育部和车间负责技术教育的工程师一起检查。对于新来的、业务不熟练的工人，在各方面指导和教育他们；因为生产过程是连续的，一个工人工作的好坏会影响全盘。对技术检查部的工作人员，也组织专门训练班，进行教育，并且检查他们的知识，使他们能胜任地检查产品。
    （2）经常检查各车间遵守技术手续的情况。由工厂总技师部和车间技术部主任一起检查。检查操作的次序是否正确，使用的工具是否适当等等。除了劳动纪律以外，工厂有遵守技术手续的纪律。技术手续是正确地组织生产的基础，是保证生产优等质量产品的重要因素。
    （3）经常检查装备的准确性，特别是检查那些最后加工的装备。因为保持装备的准确，是减少废品的先决条件。
    （4）实现工人和技术人员的合理化建议，实行对技术手续的局部改进，推广新的技术手续。这个工厂工人和技术人员在一九五二年的合理化建议如果全部实现了，可以节约六百五十万卢布。
    （5）改进产品的结构。工厂设有总设计师部，它负责研究有关改进汽车的结构问题，研究和实验汽车的新零件、新部分，把成功的采纳到工厂的生产中去。这常常大大改进了汽车的质量。例如：一九五二年，在汽缸头顶的自动闭塞器上装置了生铁套，并且改用铬制活塞环，结果汽车的发动机寿命从三万五千公里行程延长到五、六万公里行程。
    怎样当厂长
    在雅各甫列夫同志的谈吐中，我觉察到他是一位富有经验的厂长，所以请他谈谈他怎样当厂长。在我的坚请之下，雅各甫列夫同志满足了我的要求，但他一再谦逊地声明他所谈的只是他一个人的有限的经验，只供参考而已。
    雅各甫列夫同志首先谈了领导艺术的基础。他说：“为了保证工作的成功，要依靠群众，首先要依靠先进部分——党的组织。要向群众学习——就是说，要争取工人、领班、车间主任的意见。‘莫斯科人’汽车工厂之所以能够迅速地完成任务，就是依靠巨大的创造性的力量——群众。斯大林同志说过：计划就是活的人们，这就是我们和你们。这就是领导工作的基础。正确的道路是：教育全体职工，自己也要向全体职工学习。”
    雅各甫列夫同志接着谈了三点经验。
    首先，厂长要很好地熟悉业务。这样才能够解决各部门提出的问题，并且正确地解决它们。雅各甫列夫同志不满足于自己过去所受到的高等教育，而经常提高自己的思想、政治、业务的水平；因为苏联的技术进步得非常快，如果一个领导工作者不提高自己，就会落后。他注意研究同业工厂的一切先进经验，并且把它们运用到自己的工厂中来。特别在掌握先进的技术手续方面，他认为厂长要起带头作用。
    第二，厂长要和车间主任、各部主任保持密切联系。雅各甫列夫同志经常到车间去，和车间主任谈车间生产问题。他经常参加车间讨论重要问题的生产会议和党的会议。这样经常的联系，使他能够了解车间的实际情况，从而能够正确地解决问题，及时地纠正差错。他经常召集各车间、各部主任和有关的人员讨论专门问题；如讨论某一车间生产的零件的质量问题，先听取技术检查部的意见，会前一星期就把要讨论的问题通知与会的人们。
    第三，厂长要深入地检查工作。雅各甫列夫同志本人每天上午主持调度会议，检查昨天的工作。他根据各生产部门供给的材料和建议，发出指示；譬如，某车间昨天没有完成工作，那么责成它今天多做些。雅各甫列夫同志还经常亲自检查工厂的第一号命令执行的情形。这是“莫斯科人”汽车工厂的传统：在上年年底或本年年初发出第一号命令，命令中指出本年工厂要做的一切基本措施，如像改进质量、减少不合格产品等等。
    为了更具体地认识雅各甫列夫同志的工作情形，我请他谈了他怎样支配他的一天。
    雅各甫列夫同志每天上午八点半钟到达工厂。他首先翻阅工厂当值人关于工作完成情形的报告。接着他巡视两三个车间，检查工作中的某些问题。十点到十一点他召开调度会议。十二点他吃早饭。吃早饭的时候，他和工厂党委商量十分钟到二十分钟事情——关于昨天和今天的工作情况和问题。下午两点到四点，他以一个半到两个钟头举行专题会议
    （这种会议经常开，但不是每天开）。他每星期参加一次区党委会议、州党委会议或市苏维埃会议。他每星期接见工人一次，解决他们个人问题（有时也解决合理化建议之类工作问题），一次谈二三十个人，都是预先报名的。时间是在下午四点到六点。他常常到莫斯科斯大林汽车工厂去，差不多一星期去一次，吸收那里的一切先进经验。高尔基城莫洛托夫汽车工厂虽然离的远，他也常去，已去过几十次。除工作外，他也学习。他不久前研究了苏联共产党第十九次代表大会文献、斯大林“苏联社会主义经济问题”，并且领导了一个研究苏联共产党第十九次代表大会文献的小组。他常常在全厂斯大哈诺夫工作者会议上、党和行政的积极分子会议上作报告。
    从工人到厂长
    雅各甫列夫最后才谈了他的身世。
    他出身在工人的家庭。他的父亲是钳工，老党员，已于一九五二年去世。因为孩子多，他的父亲在他读完七年级后便送他去当工人。他当了三年搬运工人，从一九二五年到一九三五年，他是共产主义青年团团员。他不脱离生产地念了一年大学预备班之后，一九二九年进了莫斯科矿山大学，一九三四年毕业，成为机械工程师。然后他进了工厂，当过车间主任、工厂总工程师、管理局总工程师。他在“莫斯科人”汽车工厂已经服务十年——当了七年副厂长和三年厂长。他在一九四○年加入了苏联共产党。他被选为工厂党委员会委员、区党委员会委员、市苏维埃代表、州党监察委员会委员。
    雅各甫列夫同志从工人出身的身世，正如他的丰富经验一样，在苏联并不是罕见的。在苏联，不少厂长以至部长，本来都是普通工人，由于社会主义社会给予很好的条件，由于自己努力学习，终于担负起社会上更重要的工作。
    最后，当我起立告辞并且感谢主人的热心讲解的时候，雅各甫列夫同志紧紧地握着我的手。他说：向中国人民介绍自己的经验，这是苏联人的本分。只要这点经验对于新中国建设有一点帮助，就是莫大的快慰。苏联在开始建设时期，全靠自己艰辛的摸索，现在中国有苏联作榜样，爱好劳动的中国人民一定能更快地建设起强盛的国家。
    我感佩着雅各甫列夫同志的国际主义精神，怀着雅各甫列夫同志对我国建设的同样信念，离别了“莫斯科人”汽车工厂。
    五月十日于莫斯科
