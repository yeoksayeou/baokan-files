    Severely Punish Yang Maolin and Other Bad Elements
    ——Summary of Readers' Letters

    Following the publication of the report "Why Bad Element Yang Maolin Was Able to Entrench Himself in the Township Government and Implement a Reign of Terror for a Long Time" on the third page of this newspaper on April 13th, readers have written to this newspaper to express their opinions. Many readers pointed out the nature of Yang Maolin's crimes. Liu Naichao, Chen Zhiqiang, Fu Lianxun, and others from a certain unit of the Chinese People's Liberation Army Navy wrote: "We believe that Yang Maolin's behavior is not a matter of mistakes, but clearly a counter-revolutionary act." A soldier from a certain unit of the Chinese People's Liberation Army wrote: "Yang Maolin's behavior has shown that he is not serving the people, but serving the feudal landlords, local tyrants, and evil gentry." The crimes of the bad element Yang Maolin aroused great anger among readers. Shao Fashi from the Sancha Branch of the Liaodong Province Forestry Industry Bureau wrote: "I have personally suffered persecution from counter-revolutionary elements. When I saw the report exposing Yang Maolin's crimes, I was extremely resentful towards Yang Maolin." Jiang Guangliang from Qianyang County, Hunan Province, wrote: "Yang Maolin's crime of entrenching himself in the township government and terrorizing the people for a long time is something that we working people can never tolerate." Readers such as Zhang Xuwu from Henan Province also expressed the same feelings. Readers also further pointed out the responsibility for the Yang Maolin incident in their letters. Chen Jihan, a farmer from Sui County, Hubei Province, wrote: "From this incident, I deeply feel that the bureaucratic style of the local leading organs has reached an extreme." Wang Ke, a soldier from a certain unit of the Chinese People's Volunteers, wrote: "Lei Zhaochun, the Organization Minister of Liquan County (currently the Deputy Secretary of the Liquan County Party Committee), Gou Jinghua, the Deputy Secretary of the Fourth District Party Committee of the county, and Zhang Siwen, the acting secretary of the County Party Committee, treated the opinions of the masses with such serious bureaucracy, which is intolerable." Readers Zhang Chao, Pan Tao, Zhang Lü, Lin Bin, Jiang Xingwen, and others supported the "Editor's Note" in this newspaper, which stated that "the leading organs of Shaanxi Province and the local county need to treat this incident as a typical event for handling." Zhu Jizhi and six others from Jinan City, Zhou Ansheng and two others from Hunan Province, and Zhang Xiulin, An Shilian, and others also expressed the same. Zheng De'an and twenty others from the Zhongshan County Federation of Trade Unions in Guangdong Province and Zhang Chengping expressed their deep condolences to the peasant brothers in the Fourth Township of Liquan County who suffered. Fang Jun, a soldier from a certain unit of the Chinese People's Liberation Army, wrote: "The peasant brothers in Liquan County who exposed the bad elements to the People's Government should more boldly expose the crimes of the bad elements; they should wage a resolute struggle against all bad people and bad deeds." Readers unanimously demanded that the bad element Yang Maolin and all the bad elements in his group be severely punished.
