Xinhua News Agency dispatch:

    The strike initiated by workers at Japan's Oji Paper Company and Honshu Paper Company, demanding wage increases, is ongoing.

    More than 4,000 members of the Oji Paper Company's labor union, after continuing a 48-hour strike from the 21st, conducted a 72-hour strike from the 23rd. Because the capitalist side still refused to accept the workers' reasonable demands, the union decided to use 40 million yen as a fund to carry out a long-term struggle, and announced an indefinite strike starting from the 26th.

    The paper mill workers' strike has made the supply situation of Japanese newspapers increasingly serious. As of the 24th, the national stock of white newsprint was only sufficient to last for ten days.

    日本造纸工人举行罢工
    据新华社讯：日本王子造纸公司和本州造纸公司工人为要求增加工资而发动的罢工斗争，正在坚持中。
    王子造纸公司工会的四千多名会员自二十一日起继续进行了四十八小时罢工之后，二十三日起又进行了七十二小时的罢工。由于资方仍然拒绝接受工人的合理要求，工会方面决定以四千万日元作为基金，进行长期斗争，并已从二十六日起，宣布进入不限期的罢工。
    造纸工人的罢工，使日本报纸的供应情况越来越严重。到二十四日为止，全国白报纸的库存量只够维持十天之用。
