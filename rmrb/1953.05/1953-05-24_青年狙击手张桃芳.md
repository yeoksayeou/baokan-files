Young Sniper Zhang Taofang
	Peng Haiquan Jiang Zi
Recently, on the heroic Shangganling position on the Korean front, a new heroic deed has emerged: Zhang Taofang, a sniper from a certain unit of the Volunteer Army, killed or wounded 211 enemies with 437 bullets in 31 days, creating the highest record of cold-gun killing on the Korean front.

Zhang Taofang is a new soldier who has only been on the front line for more than three months, a young man of only twenty-two years old. When he came to the Shangganling position, the heroic deeds in the Battle of Shangganling moved this new soldier's heart. He thought: "I must learn from the old soldiers, and I must fight the enemy fiercely like them." At this time, the unit was enthusiastically launching a cold-gun and cold-cannon killing campaign, and the superior also called for creating "snipers who killed a hundred enemies." Zhang Taofang plucked up his courage and said to the squad leader: "I also want to participate in hitting live targets." The squad leader hesitated for a moment and pointed to a stone in front of him and said, "You first try three shots at a dead target." As a result, two out of three shots hit the target, and the squad leader agreed to let him go to the shooting platform to participate in hitting live targets.

As soon as Zhang Taofang got on the shooting platform, he found several enemies walking on the opposite mountain. He was both happy and nervous. He immediately fired twelve bullets, but not only did he not hit a single enemy, but he also emboldened them, and they ran around more ostentatiously. He came down from the shooting platform with a stomach full of anger. In the evening, the squad leader asked him: "Xiao Zhang, how many did you hit today?" Zhang Taofang blushed, pouted, and said: "Not only did I not hit one, but I was also bullied by the enemy. It's really strange! In the past, when I was shooting with live ammunition, I still managed to hit 25 rings. Why doesn't it work on the battlefield?" The squad leader comforted him and said: "Don't worry, you were hitting dead targets at that time, and now you are hitting live targets, so of course it's not easy to hit!" Then the squad leader asked him again: "Did you aim at the enemy?" He said: "Of course!" The squad leader patted him on the shoulder and said: "No wonder you couldn't hit them. By the time you aimed at the enemy and fired, the enemy would have already run past!" Zhang Taofang suddenly realized. The squad leader patiently taught him how to hit enemies going up the mountain, how to hit enemies going down the mountain, how to hit enemies running sideways, and how to hit enemies running fast and slow. The squad leader's words gave Zhang Taofang great inspiration.

The next day, the squad leader and he went to the shooting platform together. The squad leader said to him: "Try hitting according to the method I told you and see if it works." After a while, three enemies came down from the opposite mountain. Zhang Taofang hurriedly raised his gun and aimed ten centimeters above the head of the first enemy. With a "bang," to his surprise, it was the second enemy who fell down. He asked the squad leader very strangely: "Why did I aim at the first one, but hit the second one instead?" The squad leader asked him in return: "Did you aim at the knees?" He replied: "No, I aimed at the head." The squad leader said: "Then of course it was the second enemy who fell down. You have to know that this is hitting enemies going down the mountain! What did I tell you yesterday?" Zhang Taofang thought about it. Because he was too nervous just now, he had reversed the squad leader's words. That day, he knocked down four enemies with a few shots according to the squad leader's words. Zhang Taofang taught the enemy a good lesson this time, and they didn't dare to run around ostentatiously anymore. The annoyance he had accumulated yesterday was relieved. In the evening, he said to the squad leader: "You have helped me a lot. But I think it's too few to hit only four enemies a day. Can we try to hit more?"

The squad leader said: "Then you have to be familiar with the terrain. You have to let the muzzle of the gun wait for the enemy to hit, don't let the muzzle of the gun follow the enemy's butt, knocking down this one and letting go of that one." So, the third day he did not shoot. He and the squad leader specially observed the enemy's activity routes, and measured the distances of the most difficult places on the enemy's position and the places where the enemy often rested, and numbered them as fixed blockade points. As long as they heard the observer's report of "Target found at number ×," the enemy would lose their lives when the gun fired.

Then, Zhang Taofang participated in a sniper talk held by the regiment. At the meeting, he learned another experience: to grasp the enemy's movement pattern and not stay on the shooting platform all day long waiting. After Zhang Taofang returned, he consulted with the squad leader on the enemy's movement patterns. The result of the research was: early morning and evening are the times when the enemy is transporting, and noon is the time when the enemy is delivering food. The enemies who transport and deliver food are slower because they have heavy burdens, and are easier to hit.

Once, Zhang Taofang was putting the muzzle of his gun on a fixed blockade point waiting, when he suddenly heard the observer shout: "Attention! Live target found at number two!" Zhang Taofang took a look, and sure enough, an enemy was climbing up with something on his back. With a "bang," the guy rolled down the mountain. The observer saw in the telescope that the guy was carrying a bucket of oil. The oil flowed on the ground, and the man rolled down along the oil. Everyone laughed so hard that they couldn't breathe. A soldier also said humorously: "Damn, this guy is still trying to get oil even when he's dying."

Another time, Zhang Taofang was waiting for a target on the shooting platform when suddenly two enemies ran out of the bunker. Zhang Taofang observed carefully and found that the two devils were arguing, and the more they argued, the more fierce they became, and they even forgot about the power of the Volunteer Army snipers. Zhang Taofang said: "Hey! Don't argue, let me mediate for you!" Saying that, he sent a shot with a "bang!" One enemy was immediately knocked down on the ground, and the other slipped away at once. In this way, Zhang Taofang's battle record quickly increased. In the eighteen days of battle, he eliminated 71 enemies with 225 bullets, almost eliminating an enemy with every three bullets, and eliminating three to four enemies every day. The whole squad eliminated a total of 564 enemies. Nine comrades were awarded the third-class merit, and the whole squad won the honorary title of collective third-class merit. Zhang Taofang was also approved to participate in the New Democratic Youth League.

In order to further cultivate Zhang Taofang, the superior transferred him to the sniper training team to study for two weeks. He was not proud of his battle record. On the contrary, he learned other people's experience more humbly. The instructor patiently explained, so that his practical experience was raised to theoretical principles. Therefore, he was also the most outstanding one in the sniper training team.

After Zhang Taofang's study, his sniping skills were indeed significantly improved. In the following 13 days, he eliminated 140 enemies with 212 bullets, averaging two enemies killed for every three bullets, and averaging 10 to 11 enemies killed per day. In the five days from April 8th to 12th, he eliminated 51 distant enemies with 55 bullets, almost hitting every shot.

The enemy was anxious because of Zhang Taofang's gun, and began to retaliate. One day, a row of 60 mortar shells suddenly came from the mountain at target number two and exploded in front of Zhang Taofang. Zhang Taofang thought: 60 mortars have never been fired from that place before. This is obviously trying to retaliate! Shoot! Okay, let's see if your cannon is more powerful or my gun is more powerful! After waiting for the enemy to fire a burst of shells, he observed carefully. At this time, the enemy couldn't hold back and poked his head out to see his "results." Zhang Taofang didn't allow him to watch, and shot him down with one shot. The remaining one jumped into the traffic trench.

After that, the enemy swept with machine guns and bombarded with artillery, and the smoke and dust around Zhang Taofang were filled with smoke, and sparks of fire splashed from the stones beside him, but he could not hit Zhang Taofang. It turned out that when Zhang Taofang first started hitting live targets, he thought: "To eliminate a large number of enemies, I must find a way to let me hit the enemy and not let the enemy hit me." Therefore, he extended the traffic trench to a stone more than one meter high, and dug two shooting platforms on both sides of the stone. If an enemy was found on the left, he would go to the left to shoot, and if an enemy was found on the right, he would go to the right to shoot; he also dug an air-raid shelter under the traffic trench. Whenever the enemy's artillery bombardment was tight, it was when Zhang Taofang was resting in that cave; the enemy could only see the big stone and could not see Zhang Taofang at all. Up to now, the stone, which was more than one meter high, has been beaten by the enemy to only 50 or 60 centimeters high, but it has not hit a single hair on Zhang Taofang.

After the enemy's retaliation failed, they played new tricks.

One morning, as soon as Zhang Taofang got on the shooting platform, he clearly saw four enemies sitting on the position. He thought it was strange: these days, the enemy has always been as afraid as rabbits. Why are they so brave today? While wondering, he fired a shot fiercely, but the four enemies were still sitting there motionless. The observer immediately reported: "Don't pay attention to it, it's a trick played by the enemy, straw dummies." This puzzled Zhang Taofang. After that, every morning, Zhang Taofang found that such "enemies" were increasing. The enemy had inserted straw dummies in front of almost every bunker and on every road; but no matter how cunning the enemy was, it was useless. Once, Zhang Taofang found an enemy running in target number five. When he aimed his gun at him, this guy suddenly hid behind the straw dummy. He thought to himself: "This guy must be unable to run anymore and wants to hide behind the straw dummy to rest. Okay! I'll let you rest for a long time!" He fired a shot with a "bang," and the enemy immediately fell down away from the straw dummy. Another time, Zhang Taofang saw a straw dummy suddenly become fatter. He knew there was something wrong here, so he quietly observed. Suddenly, under the reflection of the sun, he saw two glass-like things flashing brightly on the head of the straw dummy. Obviously, the enemy was using binoculars to observe our position. Zhang Taofang said calmly: "Good boy, you still want to visit our position? Sorry, our position is closed to visitors." Saying that, he fired a shot, and the devil and the straw dummy fell down together.

Up to now, Zhang Taofang's squad has eliminated 760 enemies, which is almost equivalent to two battalions; the enemies eliminated by Zhang Taofang alone are almost equivalent to two companies. Recently, an enemy who surrendered said: "I am a new soldier. When I first arrived at the front, the old soldiers told me: 'If you have nothing to do, just squat in the fortifications obediently. You can't run around outside. The Volunteer Army's cold guns are really powerful. If they say they will hit your head, they won't hit your neck!'"

    青年狙击手张桃芳
    彭海泉  蒋资
    最近，在朝鲜前线英雄的上甘岭阵地上，又出现了一桩新的英雄事迹：志愿军某部狙击手张桃芳，在三十一天里，用四百三十七发子弹，打死打伤二百十一名敌人，创造了朝鲜前线我军冷枪杀敌的最高纪录。
    张桃芳是刚上前线三个多月的新战士，一个才二十二岁的小伙子。当他来到上甘岭阵地的时候，上甘岭战斗中的许多英雄事迹，激动着这个新战士的心。他想：“我一定要向老战士学习，要跟他们一样，狠狠地打击敌人。”这时候，部队正在热烈地展开冷枪冷炮杀敌运动，上级并号召创造“杀敌百名狙击手”。张桃芳鼓着勇气对班长说：“我也想参加打活靶。”班长听了，犹豫了一下，指着前面的一块石头说：“你先打三枪死靶试试看。”结果，三发两中，班长就同意他到射击台上去参加打活靶了。
    张桃芳一上射击台，就发现对面山上有几个敌人在走动，心里又高兴又紧张，他马上射出十二发子弹，结果不但一个敌人也没打中，反而壮了他们的胆，他们更大模大样地到处跑起来。他从射击台下来，憋着一肚子气。晚上班长问他：“小张，今天打了几个？”张桃芳红着脸撅着嘴说：“一个也没有打到不算，还他妈的让敌人欺侮了一阵子。真见鬼！过去在实弹射击的时候，多少还打了个二十五环，为什么到了战场上就不管用了呢？”班长就安慰他说：“不要急，你那时候打的是死靶，现在打的是活靶，当然不容易打到啦！”接着班长又问他：“你是不是对着敌人瞄准的？”他说：“当然是呀！”班长拍拍他的肩膀说：“难怪打不到，等你瞄准了敌人再射击，敌人不早就跑过去啦！”张桃芳这才恍然大悟。班长又耐心地教他：上山的敌人怎样打，下山的敌人怎样打，横跑的敌人怎样打，快跑和慢跑的敌人又怎样打。班长的话给了张桃芳很大的启发。
    第二天，班长和他一齐到射击台上去。班长对他说：“你按照我说的法子打打看，到底灵不灵。”过了一会，从对面山上下来三个敌人，张桃芳急忙端起枪，照着第一个敌人头上十公分瞄准，“叭”的一枪，出乎他意料之外，倒下去的却是第二个敌人，他非常奇怪地问班长：“为什么我瞄的第一个，反而打倒了第二个呢？”班长反过来问他：“你是瞄准膝盖打的吗？”他答道：“不是，我是瞄在头上打的。”班长说：“那当然打倒的是第二个敌人了，你要知道这是打下山的呀！我昨天给你怎么说来？”张桃芳一想，因为刚才过于紧张，他把班长的话弄反了。这一天他按照班长的话几枪就撩倒了四个敌人。张桃芳这下可把敌人教训的乖得多了，再也不敢大摇大摆地到处乱跑。昨天郁积下的闷气这才舒了一下。晚上，他对班长说：“你对我帮助太大了。但我想，一天只能打四个敌人，太少了，是不是还可以争取多打一些？”
    班长说：“那就要熟悉地形。要叫枪口等着敌人打，不要叫枪口跟在敌人屁股后面转，打倒了这个又放走了那个。”这样，第三天就没有打。他和班长两个人专门观察敌人活动的道路，把敌人阵地上最难走的地方和敌人经常休息的地方，统通测好距离，编上号头，作为固定封锁的地方，只要听到观察员“×号发现目标”的报告，枪声响处，敌人就要丧命了。
    接着，张桃芳参加了团里召开的狙击手漫谈会，在会上他又学到了一点经验：要抓住敌人行动的规律，不要一天到晚待在射击台上老等。张桃芳回去后，就找班长研究敌人行动的规律，研究的结果是：一早一晚是敌人运输的时候，中午是敌人送饭的时候。运输的和送饭的敌人，因为身上负担重，跑得慢，比较好打。
    一次，张桃芳正把枪口放在固定封锁点上等着，忽听观察员喊了一声：“注意！二号发现活靶！”张桃芳一看，果然有一个敌人背着东西正向上爬哩，“叭”的一枪，这个家伙就滚下山去了。观察员在望远镜里看到，原来这家伙背的是一桶油，油淌在地上，人顺着油往下滚。大家听了都笑得透不过气来，一个战士还幽默地说：“妈的，这家伙临死还要揩油呢。”
    还有一次，张桃芳正在射击台上等目标等的发急，突然两个敌人从碉堡里跑了出来。张桃芳仔细观察，原来是两个鬼子吵架，越吵越凶，竟忘记了志愿军狙击手的厉害。张桃芳说：“咳！不要吵啦，让我来给你们调解一下吧！”说着就“叭！”一枪送过去，一个敌人立刻被打倒在地上，另一个也一下子溜掉了。这样，张桃芳的战绩很快增加起来了，在十八天的战斗中，用二百二十五发子弹，消灭敌人七十一名，差不多每三发子弹消灭一个敌人，每天消灭三个到四个敌人。全班共消灭了五百六十四个敌人，有九个同志立了三等功，全班获得集体三等功的荣誉。张桃芳并被批准参加了新民主主义青年团。
    上级为了进一步培养张桃芳，就把他调到狙击手训练队去学习了两个星期。他并不因为自己的战绩而骄傲，相反，更虚心地学习别人的经验；教员耐心地讲解，使他的实战经验提高到学理原则上来。因此，他在狙击手训练队也是成绩最优良的一个。
    张桃芳学习后，在狙击技术上，确实是显著地提高了。在后一个时期的十三天里，他用二百十二发子弹，消灭了一百四十个敌人，平均每三发子弹杀敌两名，平均每天杀死十个到十一个敌人。他在四月八日到十二日的五天里，用五十五发子弹消灭了五十一个距离较远的敌人，几乎是百发百中。
    敌人被张桃芳这杆枪打急了，就开始施行报复。有一天，突然从二号目标那座山上打来一排六○炮弹，在张桃芳面前炸开了。张桃芳想：那个地方从来没有打过六○炮，这明明是想报复呀！打！好吧，看你的炮厉害还是我的枪厉害吧！他等敌人打了一阵炮弹以后，就仔细地观察起来，这时敌人沉不住气了，也把头探出来想要看看自己的“战果”，张桃芳那容他观看，一枪打过去，就打倒了一个，剩下的一个就跳下交通沟里去了。
    以后敌人又是机枪扫，又是炮轰，打的张桃芳四周烟尘弥漫，身边的石头火星飞溅，可就是打不到张桃芳。原来张桃芳一开始打活靶的时候，他就想：“要大量消灭敌人，一定得想个办法，让我打到敌人，不叫敌人打到我。”因此，他就把交通沟延伸到一块一公尺多高的石头跟前，在石头两边挖了两个射击台，左边发现敌人就到左边去打，右边发现敌人就到右边去打；又在交通沟下挖了一个防炮洞，每当敌人炮轰得紧的时候，也就是张桃芳在那个洞里休息的时候；敌人只能看到这块大石头，根本看不到张桃芳。到现在为止，这块一公尺多高的石头，已经被敌人打得还有五、六十公分高了，可是却没有打到张桃芳一根汗毛。
    敌人的报复手段失败以后，又耍起新的花样来。
    一天早上，张桃芳一上射击台，就很清楚地看到四个敌人坐在阵地上。他觉得真奇怪：这些天敌人老是怕得像兔子似地，为什么今天胆子突然大起来了呢？他一边诧异，一边就狠狠地打了一枪，可是四个敌人仍然一动也不动地坐在那里。观察员马上报告说：“不要理它，是敌人玩的鬼把戏，扎的草人子。”这可使张桃芳纳闷起来。以后每天早晨，张桃芳都发现有这样的“敌人”增加，敌人几乎在每一个碉堡跟前和每一条路上都插上了草人子；但是敌人再狡猾也是白费。有一次，张桃芳又发现有一个敌人在五号目标那里跑，等他用枪瞄准的时候，这家伙一下子就隐到草人后面去了。他心里想：“这家伙一定是跑不动了，想躲在草人后面去休息一下。好啦！就叫你长期休息吧！”“叭”的一枪打过去，这个敌人马上离开草人倒下去了。又有一次，张桃芳看见一个草人子突然胖起来了，他知道这里有鬼，就静静地观察着。忽然，在阳光的反射下，他看到草人子的头部有两块玻璃似的东西闪闪地发亮。很显然敌人是用望远镜观察我们的阵地，张桃芳不慌不忙地说：“好小子，你还想来参观我们的阵地吗？对不起，我们的阵地谢绝参观。”说着就是一枪，鬼子和草人一起都倒下了。
    到目前为止，张桃芳的那个班已经消灭了七百六十个敌人，差不多等于两个营；张桃芳一个人消灭的敌人就差不多等于两个连了。最近一个投诚过来的敌人说：“我是新兵，刚到前沿的时候，老兵就对我说：‘没事就乖乖地蹲在工事里，可不敢到外面去乱跑；志愿军的冷枪可真厉害，说打你的头就不会打在你的脖子上！’”
