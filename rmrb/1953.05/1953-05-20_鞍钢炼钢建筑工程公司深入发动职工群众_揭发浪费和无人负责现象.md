Anshan Iron and Steel's Steelmaking Construction Engineering Company Deeply Mobilizes Workers to Expose Waste and Irresponsibility

[This newspaper report] Anshan Iron and Steel Company's Steelmaking Construction Engineering Company's anti-waste, anti-irresponsibility, and establishment of responsibility system campaign has been fully launched. Nearly 6,000 employees have set off a wave of studying and inspecting work, exposing waste and irresponsibility.

Since Anshan Iron and Steel Company determined that the anti-waste, anti-irresponsibility, and establishment of responsibility system campaign would be the central task of the capital construction department in the second quarter, the CCP Steelmaking Construction Engineering Company Committee held a meeting on April 11th to carefully review and study the construction situation last year and in the first quarter of this year. According to incomplete statistics, waste in the nine months of construction last year amounted to 3 billion yuan, quality rework occurred more than 50 times, and there were a total of 70 large and small accidents. These situations were mostly caused by chaotic management and unclear responsibilities. The chaotic situation of no one being responsible is a serious obstacle to completing engineering tasks. After unifying ideological understanding, the Party committee meeting formulated a specific action plan and determined that administrative heads would personally lead the movement. Subsequently, the company convened various meetings to mobilize all Party members, Youth League members, cadres, and activists to play a guaranteeing role, and held short-term training classes to cultivate backbone forces for carrying out the movement. At the same time, it organized all employees to study documents to correct ideological understanding. On April 20th, the company convened the first employee representative conference of 300 people to further implement the spirit of the movement, raise ideological awareness, announce the completion plan, and require employee representatives to go back and convey it for discussion. At the beginning, the steel and wood formwork team's movement progressed well, and it initially exposed various waste and irresponsibility phenomena. It also held an anti-waste and anti-irresponsibility exhibition, using vivid propaganda methods such as cartoons, fast-clapper talks, and peep shows to educate employees and actively study ways to improve work. The company leadership, in response to the progress of the movement, introduced the preliminary experience of the steel and wood formwork team in carrying out the movement in a timely manner, calling on administrative leaders, technicians, and staff at all levels to take immediate action. Currently, nearly 6,000 employees throughout the company have fully joined the movement, with the third work section exposing more than 180 cases of waste in one day, and the concrete team exposing more than 4,000 cases in four days.

Judging from the first stage of the Steelmaking Construction Engineering Company's work, the key to whether the anti-waste, anti-irresponsibility, and establishment of responsibility system campaign can be carried out lies in the clarity of leadership thinking and the determination to make a decision. The Steelmaking Construction Engineering Company is in a stage of intense work, as it must continue to complete the massive construction and installation project of the large rolling mill, and at the same time prepare for the construction of the first primary rolling mill and the first steelmaking plant building, which will begin construction in the third quarter.

Therefore, when the leadership arranged for the anti-waste, anti-irresponsibility, and establishment of responsibility system, cadres generally had the idea of ​​opposing the movement to the current work. The company leadership accepted the lessons learned from past work and clearly realized that without mobilizing the masses to establish a responsibility system, the engineering tasks could not be completed well. Therefore, it made a firm decision, and through a series of meetings, repeatedly explained the purpose of the movement to all cadres and the masses, emphasizing that the movement must be combined with the current work. At the same time, it stipulated that each unit should study the work situation and formulate specific action plans; and stipulated a unified study time. The company manager especially led middle-level cadres to carefully study the documents, strengthening the confidence of the cadres. On the other hand, the company leaders divided up their work, listened to reports every day, conducted in-depth inspections, and corrected deviations in a timely manner.

The Steelmaking Engineering Company's anti-waste, anti-irresponsibility, and establishment of responsibility system campaign has had a good start. The main experiences of this stage are as follows:

1.  Seriously summarize past work, study this year's tasks, identify key issues, formulate a practical plan for carrying out the movement, and hand it over to the masses for discussion, so that all employees clearly understand that this movement is to improve work, not to pursue responsibility, thereby eliminating the fear of being "rectified" and improving political enthusiasm. For example, the responsible cadres of the steel and wood formwork team seriously summarized the work and found that the material supply and storage problems were the most, and that incorrect original records made it impossible to do quota, planning, and cost accounting work. Therefore, it was proposed that materials and records were the key issues. The plan drawn up in this way was specific and practical, so the movement was launched, and the masses were full of enthusiasm, not only fully exposing the shortcomings, but also starting to study ways to improve.

2.  Grasp typical cases to promote general progress. For example, the company focused on the technical supply section as one of the key units for carrying out the movement. In a typical investigation, it specially studied the issue of processing orders and found that an order for a processed product had to go through six departments and twelve procedures. In addition to processing time, it took at least eleven days to complete, but in general, it was always delayed. For example, the processing order for the gas heating station project of the fourth work section took more than 20 days to complete, which not only delayed the construction period by half a month, but also disrupted the plan for the division of labor and cooperation of various professional companies. In addition, many budgets were inaccurate, materials lacked specifications, responsibilities were unclear, and tasks were passed back and forth, causing great losses to the project. After this problem was exposed, the masses all hated "this system for delaying things too much" and believed that "it must be reformed." Then, the problems of budget backlog and "budget travel" in the planning group of the technical supply section were discovered, which then involved the problem of blind supply in the supply group, as well as the large backlog of unused materials in the warehouse and the lack of urgently needed materials in stock. After these problems were exposed, the masses studied ways to improve them.

3.  Pay attention to mobilizing technicians and staff to participate in the movement. At the beginning of the movement, some comrades in the administrative management department who were familiar with the business had concerns and feared being "rectified." The company leadership clearly realized that mobilizing this group of people was the key to mobilizing all staff, so they assigned people to talk to them individually and explain the policies. For example, a professional team leader in the technical supply section, after careful ideological education, initially criticized his wrong thoughts and joined the movement. The company leaders also realized that technicians played an important role in an engineering project, from the formulation of the construction organization design, construction plan, and budget, to the organization of construction. Without mobilizing these comrades, the movement would not be carried out well. Therefore, from April 25th to 27th, the company continuously organized engineers, technicians, and foremen to hold seminars separately. The company leaders personally met with them to exchange opinions. This made the technicians feel that the leadership attached importance to and cared for them, dispelling their concerns and joining the movement.

Currently, all employees of the company have been basically mobilized. In order to promote the in-depth development of the anti-waste, anti-irresponsibility, and establishment of responsibility system campaign, the following tasks must also be done well:

1.  Summarize and promote advanced experience in a timely manner, combine it with in-depth inspection work, drive backward units, and eliminate blind spots.

2.  Do a good job in preparing for the third stage. After the movement enters the stage of full exposure, all materials should be classified and sorted, studied, and a preliminary draft for establishing a responsibility system should be formulated, ready to be handed over to the masses for discussion.

3.  In the exposure stage, on the one hand, urgent and easily solved problems should be solved in a timely manner to consolidate mass enthusiasm; on the other hand, attention should be paid to discovering advanced figures and model deeds, and carrying out commendations and rewards to establish advanced banners.

    鞍钢炼钢建筑工程公司深入发动职工群众
    揭发浪费和无人负责现象
    【本报讯】鞍山钢铁公司炼钢建筑工程公司反浪费、反无人负责和建立责任制运动已全面展开，近六千职工掀起了学习与检查工作、揭发浪费及无人负责现象的热潮。
    从鞍山钢铁公司确定反浪费、反无人负责和建立责任制运动为第二季度基本建设部门的中心工作以后，中共炼钢建筑工程公司委员会于四月十一日召开了会议，认真检查与研究了去年及今年第一季度施工情况。据不完全统计，去年九个月施工中的浪费达三十亿元，质量返工五十多次，大小事故共七十次。这种情况大都是由于管理工作混乱，职责不清所造成的。无人负责的混乱情况是完成工程任务的严重阻碍。党委会议在统一思想认识的基础上，制订了具体行动计划，确定行政负责人亲自领导这一运动。接着该公司就召开了各种会议，动员全体党员、团员、干部及积极分子起保证作用，并举办短期训练班，培养开展运动的骨干力量，同时组织全体职工学习文件，端正思想认识。该公司在四月二十日，召开了三百人的第一届职工代表大会，进一步贯彻运动精神，提高思想认识，宣布竣工计划，要求职工代表回去传达讨论。一开始，钢筋木模队的运动就进展得较好，初步揭发了各种浪费和无人负责现象，并举行了反浪费反无人负责的展览会，以漫画、快板、拉洋片等生动宣传方式，教育职工群众，积极研究改进工作办法。公司领导方面针对运动进展情况，适时介绍钢筋木模队开展运动的初步经验，号召各级行政负责干部与技术人员和职员立即行动起来。目前全公司近六千职工已全面卷入运动，第三工段一天内揭发浪费现象一百八十多条，混凝土队四天内就揭发了四千多条。
    从炼钢建筑工程公司第一阶段的工作来看，反浪费、反无人负责和建立责任制运动能否开展起来，关键在于领导思想明确，下定决心。炼钢建筑工程公司正处在紧张工作阶段，一面要继续完成大型轧钢厂的巨大建筑安装工程；一面要为第三季度开工的第一初轧厂及第一制钢厂厂房工程进行施工准备工作。
    因此，当领导方面布置反浪费、反无人负责和建立责任制的时候，干部中普遍有着把运动与当前工作对立起来看的思想。公司领导方面接受过去工作中的教训，明确认识到不发动群众建立责任制就不能很好地完成工程任务，于是就下定决心，通过一连串的会议，向全体干部和群众反复说明了运动的目的，强调运动必须结合当前工作进行；同时规定各单位要研究工作情况，制订具体行动计划；并规定了统一的学习时间。公司经理特别领导中级干部认真学习了文件，坚定了干部的信心。另一方面，公司领导干部进行分工，每天听取汇报，深入检查，及时纠正偏向。
    炼钢工程公司反浪费、反无人负责和建立责任制运动已有一个良好的开端。这一阶段主要的经验有如下几点：
    一、认真总结过去的工作，研究今年的任务，发现关键问题，制订切合实际的开展运动的计划，交给群众讨论，使全体职工明确认识这次运动是为了改进工作，不是追究责任，从而消除了怕“挨整”情绪，提高政治积极性。如钢筋木模队的负责干部认真总结了工作，发现材料供应与保管问题最多，原始记录不正确就无法做好定额、计划与成本核算工作，于是提出以材料、记录为关键问题。这样订出的计划又具体又切合实际，运动就开展起来，群众情绪饱满，不仅全面揭发了缺点，并开始研究了改进的办法。
    二、掌握典型，推动一般。如该公司以技术供应科为开展运动的重点单位之一，在典型调查中专门研究了加工订货的问题，发现一件加工品订货要经过六个部门十二道手续，除加工时间外，最快要十一天才能办好，但一般情况总是拖期。如第四工段瓦斯加热站工程的加工品订货手续就办了二十几天，不仅拖延工期半个月，而且打乱了各专业公司的分工配合的计划。再加上很多预算不准，材料没有规格，职责不清，推来推去，给工程造成很大损失。这一问题揭发后，群众都恨“这种制度太误事了”，认为“非改革不可”。接着又发现了技术供应科计划组预算积压和“预算旅行”的问题，因而又牵涉到供应组盲目供应问题，以及仓库中不用的材料大量积压、急用的材料没有库存等问题。这些问题揭发之后，群众就纷纷研究改进办法。
    三、注意发动技术人员和职员参加运动。在运动开始时，行政管理部门有些熟悉业务的同志有顾虑，怕“挨整”。公司领导干部明确认识了发动这一部分人是发动全体职员的关键，于是就指定专人和他们个别谈话，交代政策。如技术供应科一个专业组长经过细致的思想教育，初步批判了自己的错误思想，即投入运动。公司领导干部同时也认识到：一件工程由制订施工组织设计、施工计划与预算起，一直到组织施工，技术人员都起着重要作用，不把这些同志发动起来，运动就开展不好。因此该公司从四月二十五日到二十七日，连续组织工程师、技术员、领工员分别举行座谈会，公司领导干部亲自和他们见面，交换意见。这使得技术人员都感到领导方面对他们的重视与关怀，解除了顾虑，投入运动。
    目前该公司全体职工已基本发动起来，为使反浪费、反无人负责和建立责任制运动深入开展，还必须注意做好以下几项工作：
    一、及时总结推广先进经验，结合深入检查工作，带动落后单位，消灭空白点。
    二、做好第三阶段的准备工作。在运动进入全面揭发阶段后，应把所有材料分类整理，进行研究，制订建立责任制的初步草案，准备交给群众讨论。
    三、在揭发阶段，一面应及时解决那些迫切而易于解决的问题，以巩固群众情绪；另一方面要注意发现先进人物和模范事迹，进行表扬与奖励，树立先进旗帜。
