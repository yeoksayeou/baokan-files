    Strive to Fulfill the Five-Year Plan Ahead of Schedule
    Soviet Coal Region Miners' Competitions Achieve New Successes
    Many Coal Mines in the Donets Coal Region Have Implemented Full Mechanization
    [Xinhua News Agency] The competition initiated by the miners of the Trudovskaya coal mine in the Soviet Donbas coal region to reach the planned production capacity ahead of schedule has achieved new successes. This specific socialist competition to complete the new Five-Year Plan ahead of schedule was launched by the miners of this mine on November 3rd of last year. It has been enthusiastically responded to by miners in the Donbas, Kuzbas, Karaganda, and all coal regions across the country, and has greatly promoted the vigorous development of production in various mines. The situation in the Donbas coal region is a good example. The miners of the Trudovskaya mine guaranteed when launching the movement that they would reach the planned production capacity one year ahead of schedule. In the competition, the coal production of the mine has increased month by month, and the coal produced now has exceeded the planned quota by several months. The Petrov-Lichiyevki mine, which was the first to respond to this competition, has greatly increased its average daily coal production. For example, the No. 2-7 Lichiyevki mine has increased by 120 tons compared to the end of last year. In the "Soviet City Coal Industry" trust's New Mospino mine, the average daily coal production of all miners has increased by 125 tons. Many mines have now reached or even exceeded their planned production capacity. For example, the No. 40 "Kurakhovka" mine of the "Red Army Coal Industry" trust has greatly exceeded its planned production capacity. The average daily coal production of this mine reached the level of the last year of the Fifth Five-Year Plan in April, and therefore was awarded the Red Banner of Excellence by the Council of Ministers of the Soviet Union. All mines of the "Chistyakovantratsit" trust are approaching their planned production capacity. The miners of the No. 17 (B) mine of the trust have formulated a Stakhanov plan for utilizing production potential in order to reach and exceed the planned production capacity, stipulating a number of organizational and technical measures to promote the increase in coal production.
    [Xinhua News Agency] According to a TASS report from Moscow: The Pravda recently published a newsletter from Stalino entitled "The New Face of the Donets Coal Region." The newsletter stated: The Donets Coal Region is constantly being supplied with the latest mining machinery. Many coal mines exploiting medium-thick flat coal seams have implemented full mechanization. This means that all work in these coal mines, except for support work, has been fully mechanized. In these mechanized coal pits, coal is mined from longwall faces using Donbas coal mining combines. Then, the coal is automatically loaded into vehicles pulled by electric locomotives to the hoists. After reaching the surface, the coal is automatically sorted and loaded into coal bins, and then unloaded into train carriages and transported outside. Special small-sized combines and a new type of earth-moving machine are used in coal mines exploiting thin coal seams. In the central part of the Donets Coal Region, the work of mining marginal coal seams is being mechanized, which is the first time in the world. In mining preparation work, more and more machines have replaced the manual labor of miners in transporting rocks. In addition, there are cutting machines and combines that can drill holes, crush rocks, cut, and load rocks. The use of this combine can increase the speed of tunnel excavation work several times. In terms of underground transportation, many coal mines are specially equipped with signaling equipment, centralized control equipment, and interlocking devices, enabling one worker to control all trains coming and going underground. In addition, the coal pits themselves have undergone great changes. Hundreds of kilometers of well-excavated tunnels have been installed with electric lights, and many places are also equipped with fluorescent lights.

    争取提前完成五年计划
    苏联各煤区矿工竞赛获得新成就
    顿尼兹煤区许多煤场已实行全面机械化
    【新华社讯】苏联顿巴斯煤区特鲁多夫斯卡雅煤矿场所发起的争取提前达到预定生产能力的竞赛，已获得新的成就。这个争取提前完成新五年计划的具体的社会主义竞赛，是该矿场工人在去年十一月三日发起的。它得到了顿巴斯、库兹巴斯、卡拉干达和全国各煤区矿工的热烈响应，并大大促进了各矿场生产的蓬勃发展。顿巴斯煤区的情形就是很好的例子。特鲁多夫斯卡雅矿场的矿工在发起运动时保证要提前一年达到预定生产能力。在竞赛运动中该矿场采煤量逐月提高，现在所生产的煤已超过计划的规定好几个月了。第一个响应这一竞赛的彼得罗伏—里齐耶夫基矿场每昼夜的平均采煤量已大大增加。例如，第二—七号里齐耶夫基矿场就比去年年底增加了一百二十吨。在“苏维埃城煤业”托辣斯的新莫斯平诺矿场，全体矿工平均每昼夜的采煤量增加了一百二十五吨。许多矿场现在已经达到甚至超过预定生产能力。例如“红军煤业”托辣斯第四○号“库拉霍夫卡”矿场，已超过预定生产能力很多。该矿场每昼夜平均采煤量在四月间已达到第五个五年计划最后一年的水平，因而荣获苏联部长会议颁发的优胜红旗。“奇斯甲科汪特拉齐特”托辣斯全部矿场都快达到预定生产能力了。该托辣斯第十七号〔乙〕矿场的矿工们为了达到和超过预定生产能力，已制订了利用生产潜力的斯大哈诺夫计划，规定了一些促使煤产量增加的组织上和技术上的办法。
    【新华社讯】据塔斯社莫斯科讯：真理报最近刊载了一篇由斯大林诺寄来的通讯，题目是“顿尼兹煤区的新面貌”。通讯说：顿尼兹煤区不断得到最新式的采矿机器的供应。许多开采中型扁平煤层的煤场已实行了全面的机械化。这就是说，这些煤场除了支柱工作以外，所有其他工作已全部机械化了。在这种机械化的煤坑中，煤是用顿巴斯采煤联合机从长壁采掘面中挖掘出来的。接着，煤就自动装入由电气机车曳引到起重机旁的车辆中。到了地上之后，煤就自动分门别类装入煤槽，然后卸在火车车厢内运到外面去。开采薄煤层的煤场采用了特种小型的联合机和一种新型铲土机。在顿尼兹煤区中部，采掘边缘煤层的工作正在机械化，这在世界上还是第一次。在采矿准备工作中，越来越多的机器已经代替了矿工们装运石块的手工劳动。此外，还有截削机和可以钻洞、碎石、截削和装载石块的联合机。使用这种联合机就可以把巷道掘进工作的速度提高几倍。在地下运输方面，许多煤场专门安装有信号设备、集中控制设备和闭塞装置，使一个工人能操纵地下来往的一切列车。此外，煤坑本身也起了很大的变化。几百公里掘得很好的巷道都安装了电灯，许多地方还装有日光灯。
