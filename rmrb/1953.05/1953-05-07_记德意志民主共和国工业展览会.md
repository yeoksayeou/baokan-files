    Record of the German Democratic Republic Industrial Exhibition
    Chen Youwei
    On a clear day in April, a huge steel frame was erected in front of the Great Hall of the Working People's Cultural Palace in Beijing. Like a burly giant, it stretched its long arms into the sky for more than ten zhang, attracting the attention of passers-by from near and far. It was so high that people passing through Tiananmen Square could see the upper part of it over the newly painted red walls.
    This huge steel frame is the most prominent and important exhibit at the German Democratic Republic Industrial Exhibition held in Beijing – a tower crane weighing more than fifty tons. It demonstrates the high level of industrial and scientific technology of the German Democratic Republic.

    To Help China's Construction
    The German Democratic Republic Industrial Exhibition is an important step taken by the government of the German Democratic Republic to cooperate with and assist the Chinese people in carrying out large-scale economic construction, and to further strengthen the friendly cooperation between the people of China and Germany. In order to hold this exhibition, the staff of China and Germany have made great efforts. The preparatory work for the exhibition began as early as last year, but the specific arrangement work was completed in a very short period of time.
    Because the ship carrying the exhibits encountered a storm at sea, two-thirds of the exhibits did not arrive in our country until mid-April. At that time, the opening date of the exhibition was not far away; but in order to exhibit as scheduled, the German comrades actively carried out the work of arranging the venue on the second morning after they arrived in Beijing. Among them were famous professors, technical directors of factories, model workers who built the Stalin Avenue in Berlin, and Stakhanov workers who had won three medals. The tense work often made them forget to eat; sometimes in order to complete an installation work urgently, they even worked until four or five o'clock the next morning. In their work, they not only demanded complete precision, but also tried to be as beautiful as possible. The position of each machine, the arrangement of each exhibit, and even the angle of each light at the exhibition were carefully designed and arranged by them. With the cooperation and efforts of Chinese and German workers, the preparatory work for the exhibition was finally completed as scheduled. When the last machine was installed and the last can of paint was brushed, especially when Vice Premier Deng Xiaoping cut the ribbon to open the exhibition, every Chinese and German staff member who had worked hard for dozens of days on the eve of the exhibition could hardly suppress their joy and excitement.

    Workshop, Site, Department Store
    This exhibition is the largest and most comprehensive exhibition held by the German Democratic Republic abroad. People come here as if they have come to a factory workshop, a construction site and a department store. The tall and spacious hall has been transformed into a huge integrated workshop. Here are various drilling machines, milling machines and planers with high working efficiency, fully automated textile machines and printing presses, and the latest type of sawing machine. Most of the machines will work by themselves once they are started without care. If there is any minor problem, they will automatically stop and wait for repair. It is particularly worth mentioning that the water-powered cold circular sawing machine, whose saw blade has a diameter of 1,250 mm, can automatically adjust the feed speed according to the hardness of the material, and the fast screw rolling machine that can make 200 to 800 nails per minute, which can automatically expand and contract according to the diameter of the working material: as small as three millimeters, as large as eighty millimeters. In addition, there are high-speed lathes that can make 2,800 revolutions per minute and exquisite universal tool milling machines.
    The western half of the hall contains mostly printing presses, staplers, folding machines and paper cutters, in addition to some sawing machines and tanning machines. Here is a fully automatic folding machine that can fold 24,000 sheets of paper per hour, a two-color letterpress printing machine that can print 7,500 sheets per hour, a "fast" wire stapler that can staple 170 booklets per minute, and a semi-automatic thread binding machine. All these fast and wonderful machines have won the admiration of the audience. Here, people are once again convinced that cultural construction and economic construction are closely related; only on a strong technologically advanced industrial base can cultural undertakings achieve broad and rapid development.
    The hundreds of machines displayed in the hall have two common characteristics: they are all painted apple green; the sound they make when operating is very light. According to the German comrades in the exhibition, the results of scientists' research show that the apple green color will not damage people's eyesight under any light, and reducing the machine operating sound to a minimum is also to protect the workers' auditory organs. This not only shows the advanced science and technology of the German Democratic Republic, but also shows the meticulous care of the German Democratic Republic government for the health of workers.

    In the courtyard in front of the hall, there are many huge machines and other exhibits. In addition to the tower crane mentioned above, there is also a trailer-type mobile crane. It is powered by a diesel engine and can be driven to any part of the construction site like a truck. Its boom with a lifting capacity of five tons can rotate 360 degrees, so it is very convenient to use. This lightweight, heavy-duty machine is regarded by construction workers as their most powerful assistant. In the middle of the courtyard, there are also many drilling machines, steam engines, generators, small agricultural machines, small cars, medical vehicles, large trucks with a load of six tons, and exquisitely constructed yachts with a speed of 60 kilometers per hour.
    When people come to the east and west side halls displaying precision instruments, experimental supplies and electrical tools with a deep impression of these heavy machines, they cannot help but be immediately attracted by the exquisitely constructed and excellent performance items here. From a complete set of dental equipment to a telescope the size of a matchbox, each exhibit strongly illustrates the high level of industrial technology of the German Democratic Republic, and illustrates the diligence and wisdom of the German nation. There are many exhibits here that make the audience particularly interested: such as highly heat-resistant quartz glassware that can be used to cook food, internal organ dissection instruments that can be inserted into the human body, intercom telephones that can talk on the spot, microscopes with cameras, and shadowless cold light lamps used in medical surgery.

    Chemical industrial and textile industrial products, cultural and educational supplies, and people's daily necessities are displayed in Hall 2. These valuable things show the audience the richness of the material and cultural life of the people of the German Democratic Republic. It is arranged here like a dazzling department store, and every audience can find something they like here: people who love sports or music will linger beside the exquisitely made balls and various musical instruments, housewives will admire the ingenious sewing machines endlessly, and those engaged in medical or medical work will be interested in the human body model that can be folded into forty-five parts. The colorfast clothing, underwear made of artificial fibers, various medicines, and all the exhibits displayed here fully illustrate the development of the light industry in the German Democratic Republic.

    Further Strengthening of Sino-German Friendly Cooperation
    The holding of this exhibition has a great effect on further strengthening the friendly cooperation between the people of China and Germany. In the short dozens of days since the German comrades came to China, many touching examples have already occurred. As soon as the German comrades arrived in China, they immediately stated that they not only brought machines this time, but also brought technology, and they would hand over both to the Chinese worker brothers without reservation.
    When the machines for the exhibition had not yet arrived in China, the German comrades were invited to the Foreign Languages ​​Printing House and the Beijing Xinhua Printing House to help adjust and install their original machines. They dismantled all the original machines, and then installed them piece by piece, so that the Chinese workers could understand the entire installation process. Sometimes, they even disassembled what they had just installed, asking the Chinese workers to reinstall it, and also asking the Chinese workers to explain the principles of installation. In order to thank the German comrades for their kindness, the workers of the Foreign Languages ​​Printing House held a party with them the day after the machines were installed. At the meeting, the comrades of the two countries talked intimately, laughed heartily, songs followed songs, dances followed dances, from 6 pm until 11 pm, everyone was still enjoying themselves and reluctant to leave. Through this party, the thoughts and feelings of the workers of the two countries were more closely intertwined.

    After the machines for the exhibition arrived in China, the German comrades invited the Chinese workers - the workers of the original ordering manufacturers - to participate in the installation work together. This is indeed a good opportunity for our workers to learn technology and master technology. When the Yang Pu team of Xinhua Printing House was sent to participate in the installation work, they made a guarantee to their leaders: not only to learn, but also to learn well. During the nine days of installation, they worked with a German worker team and gradually learned the technology of installing automatic folding machines, collating machines and automatic printing machines, and are now further mastering the technology of operation and maintenance. In their work, the workers of the two countries fully demonstrated the spirit of fraternal mutual assistance and cooperation.

    Since its opening, the German Democratic Republic Industrial Exhibition has been visited by more than 100,000 people. A month later, the exhibition will also be moved to Shanghai. It can be believed that through this exhibition, the broad masses of the Chinese people will not only further recognize and understand the industrial face and production capacity of the German Democratic Republic, but also further strengthen their confidence in building our motherland.

    记德意志民主共和国工业展览会
    陈有为
    四月间的一个晴朗的日子里，北京市劳动人民文化宫的大殿前面耸立起一座巨大的钢铁骨架。它像一个魁梧的巨人一样，把长长的手臂探向十多丈的高空，吸引着远近行人们的注意。它是那么的高，路过天安门广场的人，就能隔着新刷的红墙望到它的上半身。
    这座巨大的钢铁骨架就是在北京举行的德意志民主共和国工业展览会上最突出和最重要的展品——五十多吨重的塔形起重机。它显示了民主德国的工业和科学技术的高度发展。
    为了帮助中国建设
    德意志民主共和国工业展览会是民主德国政府为了配合和帮助中国人民进行大规模经济建设，为了进一步加强中德两国人民友好合作而采取的一个重要步骤。为了举办这次展览会，中德两国的工作人员们曾经作了很大的努力。展览会的筹备工作早在去年就已开始，而具体的布置工作却是在极短的时间内紧张完成的。
    由于运送展品的船只曾在海上遇到风暴，三分之二的展品直到四月中旬才运抵我国。当时距展览会开幕的日期已经不远了；但为了如期展出，德国同志们在他们到达北京的第二天清早，就积极进行布置会场的工作。在他们中间，有著名的教授，有工厂的技术主任，有建设柏林斯大林大街的劳动模范，也有曾获三次奖章的斯大哈诺夫工作者。紧张的工作常常使他们忘了进餐；有时为了急于完成一项安装工作，甚至一直工作到第二天早上四、五点钟。在工作中，他们不仅要求做到完全精确，而且要求尽量美观。展览会上每一架机器的位置，每一件展品的摆设，以至每一盏灯光的角度，都是经过他们的精心设计和布置的。在中德工人们的合作与努力之下，展览会的筹备工作终于如期完成了。当最后一架机器装妥了，最后一罐油漆刷完了的时候，尤其是当邓小平副总理为展览会揭幕剪彩的时候，在展览会前夕辛勤工作了几十天的每一个中国的和德国的工作人员都难以抑止住自己的喜悦和兴奋。
    车间、现场、百货陈列所
    这次展览会是民主德国在国外举办的规模最宏大、内容最丰富的一次展览会。人们来到这里，就像来到了工厂的车间、建设的现场和百货陈列所里一样。高大宽敞的大殿已经变成为一所巨大的综合车间了。这里有工作效率很高的各种钻床、铣床与刨床，有完全自动化的纺织机与印刷机，还有最新式的锯木机。大部分机器一经开动就会自己工作而无需照管，如果发生什么小的毛病，就会自动停止，静待检修。这里特别值得提出的是其中用水力操作的冷圆锯机，它的锯刀直径是一千二百五十公厘，可以根据材料的硬度而自动调整进刀的速度，还有每分钟可制二百至八百个钉子的快速滚螺丝机，它可以根据工作料的直径自动伸缩：小至三公厘，大到八十公厘。此外，还有每分钟可作二千八百转的高速车床与精巧的万用工具铣床。
    大殿西半部所陈列的，除了一些锯木机与制革机外，大部都是印刷机、订书机、折摺机和截纸机。这里有每小时可以折摺二万四千张纸的完全自动折摺机，每小时可印七千五百张的二色透印版印刷机，每分钟可钉一百七十本小册子的“快速”式铁丝订书机和半自动的串线装订机。所有这些快速的奇妙的机器，都博得了观众的赞赏。在这里，人们再一次地确信，文化建设与经济建设是密切关联着的；只有在强大的技术先进的工业基础上，文化事业才能获得广泛的、迅速的发展。
    在大殿内陈列着的成百部机器，都有两个共同的特点：它们一律涂漆着苹果绿的颜色；它们在操作时所发出的声音很轻。据展览会中的德国同志解说，经科学家们研究的结果，认为苹果绿的颜色在任何光线之下都不会损伤人们的视力，而机器操作声音的减到最低限度，也是为了保护工人的听觉器官。这不仅说明了民主德国科学技术的先进，而且也表现了民主德国政府对于工人健康的无微不至的关怀。
    在大殿前的庭院里，摆设着许多巨大的机器和其他展品。除了上述的塔形起重机外，还有一架拖拉式活动起重机。它是用柴油引擎来开动的，可以像卡车一样开到建筑工地的任何部分，它的具有五吨起重能力的吊杆可作三百六十度的转动，因此使用起来十分便利。这架轻便的重型机器，被建筑工人们视为最有力的助手。庭院中间还陈列着许多钻探机、蒸汽机、发电机、小型农业机器和小汽车、医疗车、载重六吨的大卡车以及构造精致的时速六十公里的游艇等等。
    当人们带着对于这些重型机器的深刻印象，来到陈列着精密器械、实验用品与电气工具等展品的东西配殿的时候，又不能不立刻被这里的构造精巧、功效优良的东西所吸引了。从整套的牙医用具到一架像火柴盒那么大小的望远镜，每一件展品都强烈地说明着民主德国工业技术的高度水准，说明着德意志民族的勤劳与智慧。这里有不少的展品使得观众感到特别兴趣：如可以烧煮食物的高度耐热的石英玻璃器皿，可以插入人体内部的内脏解剖用器械，当场可以通话的对讲电话机，带有照相机的显微镜，以及医疗手术上用的无影冷光灯等等。
    在二殿内陈列着化学工业与纺织工业产品、文化教育用具和人民日常生活用品。这些贵重的东西，向观众们显示了民主德国人民物质与文化生活的富足情形。这里布置得像一个琳琅满目的百货陈列所，每一个观众都可以在这里找到他所喜爱的东西：爱好运动或音乐的人们将在制作得十分精巧的球类与各种乐器旁留恋不舍，家庭的主妇将对那几架灵巧的缝纫机欣赏不止，而从事医学的或医疗工作的人们，则将对那付可以折为四十五个部分的人体模型感到兴趣。永不褪色的衣料、人造纤维制成的内衣，各种医药用品，以及陈列在这里的所有展品，都充分地说明了民主德国轻工业的发达情形。
    中德友好合作的进一步加强
    这次展览会的举行，对于进一步加强中德两国人民的友好合作有着很大的作用。就在德国同志们来到中国以后这短短的几十天里，已经发生了不少动人的事例。德国同志一到中国就立即表示，他们这次不仅带来了机器，而且也带来了技术，他们要把两样东西都毫不保留地交给中国的工人兄弟。
    当展览会的机器还未到达中国的时候，德国同志们曾应邀到外文印刷厂和北京新华印刷厂去帮助调整与安装它们原有的机器。他们把原来的机器全部拆散，然后一个零件一个零件地安装，好让中国工人了解全部的安装过程。有时候，他们甚至把刚安好的再拆开来，要中国的工人重新装起，并且还要求中国工人们把安装的原理也讲出来。为了答谢德国同志们的盛情，外文印刷厂的工人们在机器装完后的第二天，曾和他们举行了一次联欢晚会。会上两国工人同志亲密地交谈，尽情地欢笑，歌声连着歌声，舞蹈接着舞蹈，从下午六时一直继续到晚上十一时，大家还是余兴未尽，留恋不去。通过这次晚会，两国工人们的思想感情是更加紧紧地交织在一起了。
    展览会的机器运抵中国以后，德国同志们就请中国工人——原订货厂家的工人们一起来参加安装工作。这对我们的工人来说，的确是一个学习技术、掌握技术的好机会。新华印刷厂的杨朴小组在被派来参加安装工作时，就向他们的领导同志提出了保证：不但要学会，而且要学好。在九天的安装期间，他们和一个德国工人小组一起工作，逐渐学会了安装自动折摺机、配页机与自动印刷机的技术，现在正在进一步掌握操作与检修技术。在工作中，两国工人充分地表现了兄弟般的互助合作精神。
    德意志民主共和国工业展览会自开幕到现在，参观的人数已经超过了十万。一个月以后，展览会还将移往上海举行。可以相信，通过这次展览会，广大的中国人民不但将进一步认识与了解到民主德国的工业面貌和生产能力，而且也将更加加强建设我们祖国的信心。
