    Deepen the Propaganda of the Party's Correct Policies on the Mutual Aid and Cooperation Movement

    The enthusiasm of the individual economy of peasants and the enthusiasm for mutual aid and cooperation are one of the basic factors in rapidly restoring and developing the national economy and promoting national industrialization. Therefore, in agricultural production propaganda, how to prevent neglecting and frustrating the enthusiasm of the peasant individual economy, and how to guide peasants to gradually organize various forms of labor mutual aid and production cooperation according to the principles of voluntariness and mutual benefit, educate the vast number of peasants to gradually understand that labor mutual aid has great advantages over the isolated individual economy, and inspire them to gradually transition from the individual economy to the road of the collective economy, has become an extremely important task at the present stage.

    In recent months, according to the Party's current policy of steady progress in developing the mutual aid and cooperation movement, newspapers in various regions have, to varying degrees, exposed and criticized right-leaning erroneous ideas that passively treat the mutual aid and cooperation movement, especially "left"-leaning erroneous ideas that neglect the enthusiasm of the peasant individual economy and blindly pursue "advanced forms." Among them, Hebei Daily and Shanxi Daily have done a better job in correcting blind and rash advances in propaganda. According to the fact that agricultural production in the local rural areas has already made great progress, that middle peasants have become the majority, and that the mutual aid movement is facing the main tendency of forced establishment of agricultural cooperatives in the need to continue to advance, Hebei Daily first carried out continuous exposure and criticism. For example, in the reports "Many Long-term Mutual Aid Groups in Our Province Actively Convert to Cooperatives" and "Serious Blind and Rash Advance Deviation Occurs in the Leadership of Cooperative Establishment Work in Some Areas of Our Province" on January 3 and March 17, it exposed the fact that Daming County completed the merger of Zhang Xishun and Jia Jianming cooperatives within a five-day deadline, and that some villages and townships in Zanhuang, Wuyi, Yuanshi, Jingxian, Shenxian, Zaoqiang and other counties blindly concentrated the leading backbone of various mutual aid groups to establish cooperatives, expand investment, add vehicles and horses, put on airs, forcibly converted livestock, farm implements, water wells, waterwheels, and mills into the cooperative at a discounted price, as well as the rash advance deviation of no work evaluation and no work recording. In addition to exposing and criticizing this deviation from the principles of voluntariness and mutual benefit in the above-mentioned reports, Hebei Daily also continuously discussed correcting the blind and rash advance deviation in the establishment of agricultural production cooperatives in editorials on January 26, March 17, and 23. The latter editorial pointed out profoundly that the current blind and rash advance deviation in the development of agricultural production cooperatives is precisely a manifestation of the erroneous tendency to violate the objective laws of leading peasants to correctly develop agricultural production. Therefore, to correct this deviation, it is necessary to truly understand and grasp the laws of agricultural production development and the laws of mass movements. And according to these laws, promptly check and rectify the work of establishing cooperatives without affecting production. The criticism made by Hebei Daily is correct. It points out that the ideological source of the "left"-leaning rash advance is subjectivism. Secondly, Hebei Daily also reported some specific methods and leadership experiences in rectifying mutual aid and cooperation. For example, the method of dividing pieces for training and appraisal in Qingyuan County on March 16 and March 28, and the report on the Jixian County convening a meeting of directors of agricultural production cooperatives to exchange leadership experiences, have a certain enlightenment effect on how the counties should start rectifying mutual aid and cooperation work. The criticism of Hebei Daily on the tendency of impetuosity and rash advance has become a powerful assistant for party organizations in various regions to correct impetuosity and rash advance. At present, the tendency of impetuosity and rash advance in some areas of the province has been basically curbed, the style of forced orders has begun to be reversed, and the prefectural and county party committees criticized by the newspaper have also made inspections and improvements. For example, Tianjin Prefectural Committee, and Daming, Jin, and Ding County Committees have successively examined their leadership ideology, reversed the tendency of impetuosity and rash advance among cadres, and fully turned to production.

    The effectiveness of Hebei Daily in correcting the propaganda of impetuosity and rash advance should continue to be expanded. This is not only because it should continue to criticize and correct the deviation of impetuosity and rash advance, but it should also go a step further, using some specific examples to illustrate how to correct the deviation, and reflect and solve new problems that occur in the process of correcting the deviation. Hebei Daily has not introduced anything in this regard. For example, Hebei Daily criticized the erroneous decision of Daming County to order the merger of Zhang Xishun and Jia Jianming cooperatives within five days on January 3, and the Daming County Committee also made an inspection and criticism (see the newspaper on March 6). Here, the typical example should be deeply reported on how Zhang Xishun and Jia Jianming cooperatives corrected the deviation, what problems occurred in the correction of the deviation, etc., to specifically indicate the way forward for the peasant masses. In fact, correcting the blind and rash advance in mutual aid and cooperation is not smooth sailing, but requires a process of twists and turns; even some ideological fluctuations may occur among cadres and the masses, or use forced orders to oppose forced orders. For example, after the six agricultural production cooperatives in Houqizhuang, Daming County, Hebei Province, "scattered in a rush" during the correction of deviations, some farmers in nearby villages' agricultural production cooperatives experienced the phenomenon of "waiting to disband" affecting production, and even some farmers mistakenly believed that "working alone is better than mutual aid" because they saw the correction of deviations. Hebei Daily should promptly pay attention to this new situation, select typical examples of one village and one cooperative, and carry out in-depth propaganda to cadres and the masses. In this regard, the propaganda of Shanxi Daily is more concentrated and in-depth. For example, on May 15, the newspaper focused on reporting the good and bad examples of four cooperatives correcting deviations, and used "Li Xiqing Cooperative Corrected Well, Ma Biao Cooperative Corrected Badly" as an example of "Two Ways of Doing Things and Two Results in Correcting the Deviation of Impetuosity and Rash Advance" to specifically educate cadres and the masses on how to correct deviations. These reports profoundly reflected the error of some cadres using forced orders to oppose forced orders, and raised an important issue in the current work of correcting deviations. For example, the exposure of Jiang Linxiu, a cadre of the Lucheng County Committee, and Dai Baofu, secretary of the Third District Committee, prohibiting farmers from withdrawing from the cooperative when correcting the deviation of running cooperatives in Shanghuang Village, as well as the exposure of Hao Yunyun and Han Bao'e, cadres of the Wuxiang County Committee, "insisting on accommodating and continuing to run" when correcting the rash advance deviation of the Dahexi Agricultural Production Cooperative, all gave cadres a vivid education, indicating that the practice of correcting forced orders with forced orders is not feasible. Unfortunately, the newspaper reported too abstractly on solving the problem, that is, how to correct the deviation. It only said, "After two days, we publicized the Party's mutual aid and cooperation policies among the members and discussed the methods of correcting the deviation..." etc. The newspaper should not lightly let go of such a crucial issue. Because, many county and district cadres do not understand how to lead agricultural production cooperatives and how to correct deviations in running cooperatives. According to the test results of thirteen county heads and deputy county heads in Tangshan Prefecture, only three passed. And among the 222 district cadres in Keshan County, Heilongjiang, 161 did not understand the issue of agricultural production cooperatives at all. This situation requires our newspapers to pay attention to selecting typical examples, clarifying policy boundaries, and specifically indicating how to correct deviations and how to steadily lead agricultural production cooperatives while exposing and criticizing; truly regard the process of correcting deviations in the mutual aid and cooperation movement as a process of specifically publicizing the Party's mutual aid and cooperation policies. This is precisely where many newspapers have not done enough.

    Educating peasants to actively and steadily carry out the mutual aid and cooperation movement and gradually carry out the socialist transformation of the agricultural economy is a major construction task for the Party newspaper in future agricultural production propaganda. Local newspapers, especially peasant newspapers, should attach great importance to this task, adopt various methods, and strive to improve the level of reporting on the mutual aid and cooperation movement.

### 深入宣传党对于互助合作运动的正确政策

    深入宣传党对于互助合作运动的正确政策
    农民个体经济的积极性，和互助合作的积极性，是迅速恢复和发展国民经济和促进国家工业化的基本因素之一。因此，报纸在农业生产宣传中，如何防止忽视和挫折农民个体经济的积极性，以及如何引导农民逐步地按照自愿和互利的原则，组织各种形式的劳动互助和生产合作，教育广大农民逐步地懂得劳动互助比起孤立的个体经济有极大的优越性，启发他们由个体经济逐步地过渡到集体经济的道路，就成为现阶段一个极其重要的任务。
    近数月来，各地报纸根据党在目前对于发展互助合作运动的这一稳步前进的方针，曾在不同程度上对消极对待互助合作运动的右倾错误思想，特别是忽视农民个体经济积极性、盲目追求“高级形式”的“左”倾错误思想，进行了一定的揭发和批判。其中尤以河北日报、山西日报等纠正盲目冒进的宣传作得比较好。河北日报根据当地农村生产已经有较大的发展、中农已经成为多数，而互助运动在需要继续前进中发生强迫建立农业合作社的主要倾向，首先进行了连续的揭发和批判。例如，一月三日、三月十七日在“我省不少长期互助组积极转社”和“我省若干地区在领导建社工作中，发生严重盲目冒进偏向”的报道中，就揭发了大名县限期五天完成张希顺、贾建明两社合并工作，和赞皇、武邑、元氏、景县、深县、枣强等县若干村乡盲目集中各互助组领导骨干建社，扩大投资，添车买马，闹排场，强迫把牲口、农具、水井、水车、碾磨折价归社，以及不评工、不记工的冒进偏向。对于这种违反自愿和互利原则的偏向，河北日报除在上述报道中予以揭发批判外，还连续在一月二十六日、三月十七日、二十三日的社论中，三论纠正建立农业生产合作社中的盲目冒进偏向。后一篇社论中并深刻指出，当前发展农业生产合作社中的盲目冒进偏向，就正是违反领导农民正确地发展农业生产的客观法则的错误倾向的一种表现。因而，要纠正这种偏向，就必须切实了解和掌握发展农业生产的规律，以及群众运动的规律。并根据这些规律，在不影响生产的条件下，迅速检查和整顿建社的工作。河北日报所作的这个批判是正确的。它指明发生“左”倾冒进的思想根源是主观主义。其次，河北日报还报道了一些整顿互助合作的具体方法和领导经验。如三月十六日、三月二十八日清苑县分片训练、评比的方法，和冀县召开农业生产合作社社长会议交流领导经验的报道，对各县如何着手整顿互助合作工作，都有一定的启发作用。河北日报对急躁冒进倾向的批判，就成为各地党组织纠正急躁冒进的有力助手，目前该省若干地区急躁冒进的倾向在基本上被制止了，强迫命令的作风开始被扭转了，受到报纸批评的地委、县委也作了检查和改进。如天津地委、大名、晋县、定县县委等，都先后检查了领导思想，扭转了干部中的急躁冒进倾向，全力转向生产。
    河北日报在纠正急躁冒进宣传上的成效，还应该继续扩大，这不只是还应该继续批判和纠正急躁冒进的偏向，而且还应深入一步，用一些具体事例来说明怎样纠正偏向，并反映和解决纠正偏向中所发生的新问题。在这一点上河北日报还没有什么介绍。例如，该报一月三日曾批评了大名县限令五天合并张希顺、贾建明两社的错误决定，大名县委也作了检查批判（见三月六日该报）。这里对于张希顺、贾建明两社如何纠正偏向，纠正偏向中发生了什么问题，等等，就应该作为典型，深入报道，给农民群众具体地指明前进的道路。事实上，纠正互助合作中的盲目冒进，并不是一帆风顺的，而是要经过一些曲折斗争过程的；甚至在干部群众中会发生一些思想波动，或以强迫命令来反对强迫命令。例如，河北省大名县后齐庄六个农业生产合作社在纠正偏向中“一轰而散”后，附近村庄农业生产合作社的有的农民，发生“等待散伙”影响生产的现象，甚至有的农民因为看到纠正偏向，便误认为“单干比互助强”。河北日报应及时注意这方面的新情况，选取一个村一个社的典型事例，对干部群众进行深入的宣传。在这一方面，山西日报的宣传是比较集中和深入的。例如五月十五日该报曾集中地报道了四个社纠正偏向的好坏典型，并以“李喜庆社纠好了马彪社纠糟了”作为“纠正急躁冒进偏向中的两样作法两个结果”的实例，来具体地教育干部群众应如何进行纠正偏向。在这几篇报道中深刻地反映了有的干部以强迫命令反对强迫命令的错误，提出了当前纠正偏向工作中一个重要问题。如对潞城县委会干部江潾秀、三区区委书记戴宝福在纠正上黄村办社偏向时制止农民退社的揭发，以及对武乡县委会干部郝炎云、韩保娥在纠正大河西农业生产合作社的冒进偏向时“硬要迁就办下去”的揭发，都给干部以活生生的教育，说明以强迫命令纠正强迫命令的作法，是行不通的。可惜该报在解决问题方面，即如何纠正偏向的办法方面报道得太抽象，只说“经过两天时间，在社员中宣传了党的互助合作政策，酝酿了纠正偏向办法，……”等等。对于这样一个关键性的问题，报纸是不应该轻轻把它放过去的。因为，对于如何领导农业生产合作社，如何纠正办社偏向，是有很多县区干部不懂得的。据唐山专区正副县长十三人测验的结果，及格者只有三人。而黑龙江克山县二百二十二名区干部中，对农业生产合作社问题一点也不懂的就有一百六十一名。这种情况就更要求我们的报纸，在与揭发批判同时，还必须注意选择典型，划清政策界限，具体地指明应该如何纠正偏向，如何稳步领导农业生产合作社；真正把纠正互助合作运动中的偏向的过程，作为一个具体地宣传党的互助合作政策的过程。关于这一点，正是很多报纸作得不够的地方。
    教育农民积极而又稳步地开展互助合作运动，逐步地进行农业经济的社会主义改造，是党报在今后农业生产宣传中一项主要的建设任务。各地报纸特别是农民报纸应该十分重视这个任务，采用各种方法，努力把互助合作运动报道的水平提高一步。
