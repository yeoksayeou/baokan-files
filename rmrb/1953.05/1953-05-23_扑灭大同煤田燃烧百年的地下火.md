Extinguishing the Century-Old Underground Fire in the Datong Coalfield  Wu Gang, Yi Xiao

"Datong is China's richest coalfield, and also the world's richest coalfield." This is the assessment of the Datong Coalfield by Soviet experts. The Datong Coalfield covers a vast area. Underneath the plateau spanning 120 kilometers north-south and 20 kilometers east-west across six counties including Datong, with an area of 2,400 square kilometers, rich coal seams are everywhere, with the thickest coal seams reaching over 20 meters. The reserves of the coalfield have not yet been accurately calculated. According to the most conservative survey figures from Japanese plunderers, they are over 40 billion tons. Datong coal is the best industrial coal, and the coalfield itself has excellent mining conditions, with a solid roof and little gas and water, which is unmatched by coal mines throughout the country.

However, in this rich coalfield, for a century, over a hundred places have been burning day and night, and the country's valuable resources have turned to ashes before they could bring beneficial light and heat to the people.

We have been to the fire zones of Qifeng Mountain, Baituyao, Majiliang, and Hujiawan in the Datong Coalfield, and the sight of the coal seams burning is truly shocking. Even from a high ground five kilometers away from the Qifeng Mountain fire zone, one can see the top of Qifeng Mountain emitting billowing coal smoke and water vapor, like clouds. The burning of the Huangtugou coal seam has caused cracks to open on the ground, and the smoking cracks are as long as one kilometer. Some of the large caves that are smoking are too hot for people to approach. If you insert a twig or a piece of paper into the cracks, it will immediately be roasted to a charred yellow. The stones have also been eroded by water vapor and become brittle. A cliff nearly ten meters high in the Yaogou fire zone has already collapsed. In the Majiliang fire zone, the burning of the coal seam has caused a piece of land of more than ten square meters to sink. In areas where the coal seam is burning severely, flames can be seen emerging from the cracks at night. Near these cracks, green grass grows all year round. A fifty-year-old Taoist priest at the Jingshi Temple in the Qifeng Mountain fire zone told us that there is never any snow here in winter. When he was a child, he and his fellow disciples often roasted potatoes on the stones with cracks. He said that the Qifeng Mountain coal seam had been burning for so long that even his master didn't know. He only remembered that the underground fire used to burn behind the temple, but now it has spread to the east.

It is not yet possible to determine how many years the Datong coal seam has been burning. Judging from the words of the old Taoist priest at the Jingshi Temple, the Qifeng Mountain coal seam began to burn at least a hundred years ago. Why is the coal seam burning? The masses near the mining area have put forward a unanimous opinion, believing that this was caused by the plunder and destruction of the Manchu Dynasty, Japanese imperialism, and the Chiang Kai-shek and Yan Xishan bandit gangs. Old miners say that in the past, the coal miners worked very hard. When mining coal, they had to strip naked, crawl into the coal kiln, and then carry large pieces of coal out of the inclined hole. During the Manchu Dynasty, many of the workers mining coal here were so-called "criminals" who had been exiled. The extremely hard life and cruel oppression aroused the miners' riots. The rioting workers set fire to the coal kilns, and the coal seam has been burning ever since. Wang Zilin, a farmer in Beilou Village in the Baituyao fire zone, told us definitively that when the Japanese devils fled after surrendering, they set fire to the pit wood in the coal mine. Therefore, the Baishiyao Coal Mine, one of the eight modernly exploited coal mines in Datong, has become a fire pit that is still burning. In the entire Datong mining area, there are about a thousand small coal kilns, which in the past were almost all controlled by landlords and bureaucrats. Those plunderers never cherished the resources of the motherland. They trampled on the rich coalfield everywhere, digging a hole here, opening a pit there, and mining wherever the coal seam was good. Moreover, when mining, they only picked large pieces of coal, and coal blocks smaller than half a meter square were discarded underground. In this way, over the years, coal with high sulfur content would generate heat and spontaneously combust. It is said that the coal seam in the Majiliang fire zone started to be mined in 1923, and it spontaneously combusted in 1927. In addition, landlords and bureaucrats often set fire to the coal seams when they were deadlocked in the struggle for mining rights, preferring to burn them down rather than let the other party mine them.

After liberation, the rich Datong Coalfield returned to the hands of the people. In the future, it will shine and generate heat for the people's livelihood needs for a long time. Especially during the new period of national economic construction, it will continuously supply industrial coal. The people love and cherish this resource. Since liberation, eliminating the fire disaster in the Datong Coalfield has become a very urgent action. In February this year, the Datong mining area received a most exciting good news: Premier Zhou issued instructions to the North China Coal Mine Administration and related units, requiring them to carry out fire extinguishing work in accordance with the principles of being the most thorough, the fastest, and the most economical, so as to save the country's resources from major losses. This is a battle call. The work of extinguishing the coal seam burning caused by successive reactionary rulers has begun.

Naturally, to extinguish the burning of over a hundred underground coal seams scattered over an area of more than 2,000 square kilometers is indeed an extremely arduous task. The burning situation of the underground coal seams is not easy to grasp, transportation is inconvenient, and the lack of water resources in the northern plateau will bring many serious difficulties to the fire extinguishing work. For example, the northern part of the Majiliang fire zone can build dams to use mountain floods for irrigation, but the Huangtugou fire zone in the south is high in terrain and must be dug with roadways around it and then filled with loess to isolate it from other coal seams. This is a huge project that will take three years to complete. As for the Qifeng Mountain fire zone, which cannot use mountain floods for irrigation or be filled with loess, it needs to have the entire top of the mountain removed to expose the burning coal seam and then extinguish it. This project will take at least two years.

However, these difficulties cannot stop the people's determination to extinguish the fire. According to Premier Zhou's instructions, the North China Coal Mine Administration, the Datong Mining Bureau, the Shanxi Province and Datong City People's Governments, and the CPC Yanbei Local Committee and other units have established the Datong Fire Extinguishing Committee on April 1 and immediately began intensive preparations. In order to organize forces to quickly extinguish the coal seam burning in the fire zones with large reserves in the center of the coalfield, the Fire Extinguishing Committee began on April 2 to survey the burning situation in the Majiliang, Hujiawan, and Qifeng Mountain fire zones, and then made the fire extinguishing engineering design and plan. The Fire Extinguishing Committee also organized two working groups, which went to the counties in the mining area on April 13 to cooperate with the local people's governments to investigate the fire zone situation in various places and make fire extinguishing plans.

Extinguishing the century-old underground fire in the Datong Coalfield is a long-term and arduous task, but we believe that the people will eventually conquer the fire, rescue the country's rich resources from the fire, and apply them to the road of national industrialization.

    扑灭大同煤田燃烧百年的地下火  吴钢、伊晓
    “大同是中国最富的煤田，也是世界上最富的煤田。”这是苏联专家对大同煤田的评语。大同煤田的范围很广，在大同等六县南北长一百二十公里、东西宽二十公里，面积达二千四百平方公里的高原地带下，处处蕴藏着丰富的煤层，最厚的煤层达二十多公尺。煤田的蕴藏量到现在还没有精确的统计，根据日本掠夺者最保守的勘察数字，也在四百亿吨以上。大同煤是最好的工业用煤，而且煤田本身又具有优良的开采条件，顶板坚固，很少瓦斯和水，这是全国各地煤矿所不及的。
    然而，在这个丰富的煤田里，百年来，有一百多处日日夜夜在燃烧着，国家宝贵的资源在没有带给人民有益的光和热以前，就变成了灰烬。
    我们曾经到过大同煤田的七峰山、白土窑、马脊梁、胡家湾等火区，看到煤层燃烧的景象，真是触目惊心。还在距七峰山火区五公里以外的高地，便可远远看见七峰山山顶冒着腾腾的煤烟和水蒸汽，好像云朵一样。黄土沟煤层的燃烧，使地面张开了裂缝，正在冒烟的裂缝长达一公里。有些正在冒烟的大洞穴旁，由于高热，人们都不能接近。如果把草枝或纸片插进裂缝里，立刻会烤成了焦黄色。石头也被水蒸汽侵蚀而发酥，窑沟火区的一个近十公尺高的崖头已经垮下。马脊梁火区因煤层燃烧，已有一处面积十余平方公尺的地皮下陷。在煤层燃烧得严重的地方，夜里还可看见从裂缝中冒出的火苗。这些裂缝的附近，一年四季长着青草。七峰山火区静室庙五十岁的老道士告诉我们：这里冬季从来没有积雪。他小时和师兄、师弟们常在有裂缝的石头上烤马铃薯吃。他说：七峰山煤层烧了多少年代，连他师爷也不知道。他只记得地下火原来在庙的后面烧，现在蔓延到东面去了。
    大同煤层究竟燃烧了多少年，暂时还无法查考。从静室庙老道士的话来推算，七峰山煤层至少在百年前就开始燃烧了。煤层为什么燃烧？矿区附近的群众提出了一致的意见，认为这是满清王朝、日本帝国主义和蒋介石、阎锡山匪帮的掠夺、破坏所造成的。老年的矿工们说：过去，挖煤工人工作非常苦，挖煤时，要把衣服脱得精光，钻到煤窑里去，然后背上大块煤从斜洞里爬出来。满清王朝的时候，在这里采煤的工人，许多都是被流放来的所谓“犯人”。极苦的生活和残酷的压迫，激起了采煤工人的暴动，暴动的工人一把火点燃着煤窑，煤层便一直燃烧下来。白土窑火区北楼村农民王自林确切地告诉我们：日本鬼子在投降后逃跑时，曾把煤矿里的坑木点燃，因此，大同八大近代化开采煤矿之一的白石窑煤矿，便成为至今燃烧着的火窟。在整个大同矿区里，约有一千多个小煤窑，过去，这些煤窑几乎都被控制在地主和官僚们的手里。那些掠夺者从来不珍惜祖国的资源，他们到处蹧踏丰富的煤田，这里挖一个洞，那里开一个坑，那里煤层好便到那里开采。而且，开采时只拣大块煤，半公尺见方以下的煤块，便丢弃在地下。这样，年长日久，含硫大的煤便发热自燃。像马脊梁火区的煤层，据说从一九二三年开始开采，一九二七年便自燃起来。此外，地主和官僚们常常在争夺开采权相持不下的时候，放火烧着煤层，宁肯烧毁，也不让对方开采。
    解放后，丰富的大同煤田回到人民的手里了，今后它将为人民的生活需要长久地发光发热，特别在国家新的经济建设时期，它将源源地供应工业用煤。人民是爱护和珍惜这资源的。解放以来，消灭大同煤田火灾，就成为非常迫切的行动。今年二月间，大同矿区得到一个最令人兴奋的喜讯：周总理给华北煤矿管理总局及有关单位下了指令，要用最彻底最迅速最节省的原则进行灭火工作，挽救国家资源的重大损失。这是一个战斗的号召。扑灭历代反动统治者造成的煤层燃烧的工作便开始了。
    自然，要扑灭分散在二千多平方公里面积内的百多处地下煤层的燃烧，的确是一件万分艰巨的工作。地下煤层燃烧的情况不易掌握、交通不便和北方高原水源缺乏等等情况，都会给灭火工作带来许多严重的困难。像马脊梁火区，它的北部可以修筑大坝利用山洪来浇灌，但是南部的黄土沟火区地势高，必须在四周挖下巷道，再用黄土充填，使其与其他煤层隔绝。这是一个浩大的工程，需要三年才能完成。至于不能利用山洪浇灌也不能用黄土充填的七峰山火区，则需要把整个山顶揭去，使燃烧的煤层露出，然后扑灭。这个工程，最少也得用两年的时间。
    但是，这些困难都阻挡不了人民灭火的决心。按照周总理的指示，华北煤矿管理局、大同矿务局、山西省和大同市人民政府、中共雁北地方委员会等单位，已经在四月一日成立了大同消火委员会，并且立即开始了紧张的准备工作。为了组织力量迅速扑灭煤田中心蕴藏量大的火区的煤层燃烧，消火委员会从四月二日开始，勘察了马脊梁、胡家湾、七峰山火区的燃烧情况，接着作出了灭火的工程设计和计划。消火委员会还组织了两个工作小组，在四月十三日分赴矿区各县，协同当地人民政府调查各地火区情况并作出灭火计划。
    扑灭大同煤田燃烧百年的地下火是一件长期而艰巨的工作，但是我们相信，人民一定会最后征服火灾，把国家这一丰富的资源从烈火中抢救出来，运用到国家工业化的大道上去。
